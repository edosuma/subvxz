00:01.169 --> 00:03.037
She's coming in hot.
She's The Mick.

00:03.071 --> 00:05.173
-Yaah!
-I just built that.

00:05.206 --> 00:06.407
It didn't take.

00:06.440 --> 00:08.476
Catch all-new episodes Tuesdays.

00:08.509 --> 00:10.511
And check out our other Fox
programs-- Brooklyn Nine-Nine,

00:10.544 --> 00:12.380
The Last Man on Earth and
Ghosted.

00:12.413 --> 00:14.548
I don't really know how
to do any of this stuff.

00:14.582 --> 00:15.749
Only on Fox.

00:20.621 --> 00:22.656
MICKEY:
31, 30,

00:22.690 --> 00:25.593
-29, 28-- you better hustle.
-ALBA: Ah!

00:25.626 --> 00:27.661
-I'm gonna make it!
-Not a chance in hell.

00:27.695 --> 00:29.830
-What are you doing?
-Oh, you guys,

00:29.863 --> 00:32.066
Alba bet me a hundred bucks
that she could go to the store,

00:32.100 --> 00:34.402
grab some smokes and be back
in under five minutes.

00:34.435 --> 00:35.769
-That's impossible.
-I know!

00:35.803 --> 00:37.771
That's what I keep telling her.

00:37.805 --> 00:39.407
Ugh, she's smoking again?

00:39.440 --> 00:41.775
I-I don't keep track
of what she does anymore.

00:41.809 --> 00:43.043
(shouts)
Coming in hot!

00:43.077 --> 00:44.112
You're never gonna make it.

00:44.145 --> 00:45.413
You might as well just give up.

00:45.446 --> 00:46.680
No! Never!

00:46.714 --> 00:48.516
-(cackling)
-All right. Ten,

00:48.549 --> 00:50.684
-nine, eight...
-(engine revving)

00:50.718 --> 00:53.121
-seven, six...
-Here I come-- whoa! No!

00:53.154 --> 00:54.122
-(crashes)
-(screaming)

00:54.155 --> 00:55.256
Alba!

00:57.291 --> 00:59.493
(Mickey gasps)

01:01.762 --> 01:04.432
(Alba grunting)

01:08.302 --> 01:10.371
-Whoa! -Yeah!
-Whoa! Amazing!

01:10.404 --> 01:12.039
MICKEY:
All right-- oh.

01:12.072 --> 01:14.208
Yep.

01:14.242 --> 01:16.144
(monitor beeping)

01:17.511 --> 01:18.979
There she is.

01:19.012 --> 01:21.081
How are you feeling?

01:21.115 --> 01:22.583
I'm alive?

01:22.616 --> 01:24.485
Oh, you have no idea
how lucky you are.

01:24.518 --> 01:26.220
Yeah, wish we could say the same
for the Maserati.

01:26.254 --> 01:27.755
You frickin' accordioned it.

01:27.788 --> 01:29.323
That's the third car
you've crashed this month.

01:29.357 --> 01:30.558
All right. Ease up.

01:30.591 --> 01:31.625
You brats have plenty of cars.

01:31.659 --> 01:32.760
There's only one Alba.

01:32.793 --> 01:34.928
They're right though:
you're gonna die.

01:34.962 --> 01:36.063
I am out of control.

01:36.096 --> 01:38.499
-Yeah.
-I need to go to rehab.

01:38.532 --> 01:41.902
-Oh, send me to the Promises
in Malibu. -No.

01:41.935 --> 01:43.337
I-I don't believe in rehab.

01:43.371 --> 01:44.672
It's ruined
too many great musicians.

01:44.705 --> 01:46.140
It sucks the zip out of you.

01:46.174 --> 01:47.975
I don't want you
to lose your zip, Alba.

01:48.008 --> 01:50.144
I just want you to not die.

01:50.178 --> 01:52.446
I huffed shoe polish yesterday.

01:52.480 --> 01:54.182
(all groaning)

01:54.215 --> 01:55.749
-Not in front of the kid.
-Well...

01:55.783 --> 01:57.185
Hey, Ben, you want
to go grab some candy

01:57.218 --> 01:58.319
out of the vending machine?

01:58.352 --> 01:59.620
-Okay.
-Okay.

01:59.653 --> 02:02.690
-(moans) Mickey, I need help.
-All right,

02:02.723 --> 02:04.024
well, you do what
every normal person does,

02:04.057 --> 02:05.259
and you go to church.

02:05.293 --> 02:06.494
Since when are you so religious?

02:06.527 --> 02:08.196
I'm not religious at all,
but I like church.

02:08.229 --> 02:09.530
Free donuts, coffee.

02:09.563 --> 02:11.265
Little wine
to take the edge off.

02:11.299 --> 02:12.666
Then you confess
all the bad stuff you did

02:12.700 --> 02:15.102
and go home guilt-free,
ready to do it all over again.

02:15.135 --> 02:16.770
Didn't your parents make you
go to church?

02:16.804 --> 02:18.005
Yeah, they forced us
when we were little.

02:18.038 --> 02:19.607
I hated church.
It was the worst.

02:19.640 --> 02:20.841
Yeah, you're supposed
to hate it.

02:20.874 --> 02:22.343
Then you feel great
once you get through it.

02:22.376 --> 02:23.777
You got to go
to church sometimes.

02:23.811 --> 02:25.145
But I don't believe in God.

02:25.179 --> 02:27.014
-Yeah, neither do I.
That's not the point. -No.

02:27.047 --> 02:29.350
-Isn't that the entire point?
-No, the point

02:29.383 --> 02:31.952
is to make yourself feel better,
reset the dials a little bit.

02:31.985 --> 02:33.887
And Alba, when you go back
to church this weekend,

02:33.921 --> 02:35.122
we're all gonna go with you.

02:35.155 --> 02:36.190
I think our souls could all use

02:36.224 --> 02:38.192
a little oil change.

02:38.226 --> 02:40.994
(organ playing)

02:41.028 --> 02:43.997
So... this is God's house?

02:44.031 --> 02:45.799
That's the general idea.

02:45.833 --> 02:47.701
Cool.

02:47.735 --> 02:48.902
Where's the kitchen?

02:48.936 --> 02:50.471
I bet he has great snacks.

02:50.504 --> 02:52.373
No more questions for now,
okay, pal?

02:52.406 --> 02:54.208
Yeah, the show's about to start.

02:54.242 --> 02:55.709
(muffled):
Okay, here we go. Excuse me.

02:55.743 --> 02:57.144
Hot coffee, coming at ya.

02:57.177 --> 02:58.312
Watch it, move those feet.

02:58.346 --> 02:59.980
Here you go.

03:00.013 --> 03:01.415
-Oh.
-What?

03:01.449 --> 03:02.683
-It's hot.
-I told you.

03:02.716 --> 03:05.219
Got you a donut.

03:05.253 --> 03:06.920
-Coconut.
-Yeah, they're free.

03:06.954 --> 03:09.890
I feel like Jesus is looking
down on me in judgment.

03:09.923 --> 03:11.392
Jesus doesn't judge,
that's his whole thing.

03:11.425 --> 03:12.526
ZACH:
Please rise.

03:12.560 --> 03:14.428
About time.

03:14.462 --> 03:16.364
Can't wait to see
this bloated sack of potatoes

03:16.397 --> 03:18.866
they yanked off the can
to emcee this thing.

03:23.103 --> 03:24.672
Weird.

03:24.705 --> 03:26.374
It's some young bro.

03:26.407 --> 03:29.277
In the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Spirit.

03:29.310 --> 03:30.611
ALL:
Amen.

03:30.644 --> 03:33.180
The Lord be with you.

03:33.213 --> 03:34.748
ALL:
And also with you.

03:34.782 --> 03:35.849
Good morning.

03:35.883 --> 03:37.117
Welcome.

03:37.150 --> 03:38.352
Happy Sunday Funday.

03:38.386 --> 03:39.887
I am Father Zach.

03:39.920 --> 03:42.256
Father Z, if you prefer.

03:42.290 --> 03:44.191
And to kick things off,
I thought,

03:44.224 --> 03:47.961
why don't we turn to thy
neighbor, and say "what's up?"

03:47.995 --> 03:49.630
-Go ahead and give him a dap.
-(laughter)

03:49.663 --> 03:51.565
Dap it out. I'll wait.

03:51.599 --> 03:52.800
He's kind of a dork,
but I like the energy

03:52.833 --> 03:54.234
-in here, you know?
-Yeah.

03:54.268 --> 03:56.704
Before we begin,
please silence your cell phones.

03:56.737 --> 03:58.572
Unless you're posting
a photo of me,

03:58.606 --> 04:01.309
in which case,
please, pick a good filter.

04:01.342 --> 04:03.076
(laughing):
Whoa.

04:03.110 --> 04:04.478
Dude's got jokes.

04:04.512 --> 04:05.579
Okay. Let us pray.

04:05.613 --> 04:06.714
BEN:
I don't get it.

04:06.747 --> 04:07.948
The show's over?

04:07.981 --> 04:09.650
Where's God?

04:09.683 --> 04:11.885
He's, uh, everywhere.

04:11.919 --> 04:13.120
Why can't we see him?

04:13.153 --> 04:14.822
I just wanted to say hi.

04:14.855 --> 04:16.790
Well, you can, you know?

04:16.824 --> 04:18.626
He's in that candle,
right there.

04:18.659 --> 04:22.596
So God lives inside the candle?

04:22.630 --> 04:24.498
Well, he's not
literally inside of it.

04:24.532 --> 04:28.068
I mean, the candle represents
God's presence in the church.

04:28.101 --> 04:30.170
So they built
this whole house...

04:32.172 --> 04:33.607
...for a candle to live in?

04:33.641 --> 04:35.175
Well, no. I mean,
when you say it like that,

04:35.208 --> 04:36.744
it sounds ridiculous, but...

04:36.777 --> 04:38.979
-Has anybody even seen God?
-JIMMY: Okay, Ben,

04:39.012 --> 04:40.147
you're seeing God. All right?

04:40.180 --> 04:41.549
He's in the candle.

04:42.483 --> 04:44.117
(gasps)

04:44.151 --> 04:45.853
I don't think I believe in God.

04:48.722 --> 04:50.858
-Little psycho.
-Yeah.

04:50.891 --> 04:52.826
-Doesn't feel right.
-No.

04:52.860 --> 04:54.161
It sounds smart and progressive
when we say it,

04:54.194 --> 04:55.295
but we're adults. He's a kid;

04:55.329 --> 04:56.864
he's not ready for that yet.

04:56.897 --> 04:58.532
At that age, you got to be
terrified of something

04:58.566 --> 05:00.368
to keep you
from becoming a jackass.

05:00.401 --> 05:02.135
We got to nip this in the bud.

05:02.169 --> 05:04.338
(quietly):
The "butt," actually.

05:04.372 --> 05:06.006
It certainly is good
to see you, Father.

05:06.039 --> 05:07.608
Father Zach?

05:07.641 --> 05:09.276
-That's me.
-Hi. Mickey Molng.

05:09.309 --> 05:11.512
This is my friend Alba.
She's a world-class sinner.

05:11.545 --> 05:13.947
And we're, uh, wondering if you
got time for a quick confession.

05:13.981 --> 05:16.550
I-I haven't been to Mass
in quite some time. (chuckles)

05:16.584 --> 05:18.452
Well, you're always
welcome back.

05:18.486 --> 05:20.020
Can I just say,
I thought religion

05:20.053 --> 05:22.790
was just a load of crap,
but that was a pretty great set.

05:22.823 --> 05:24.792
-I'm glad you enjoyed it.
-I'm so surprised

05:24.825 --> 05:26.794
how young you are. I thought
priests were, like, what? 90?

05:26.827 --> 05:28.295
Oh, we have one of those. Yeah.

05:28.328 --> 05:29.863
Father McCormick
is our head pastor.

05:29.897 --> 05:31.532
Think he's pushing
about a thousand now,

05:31.565 --> 05:33.667
but he's still killing it.
(clicks tongue)

05:33.701 --> 05:35.803
(McCormick scoffs)

05:35.836 --> 05:38.305
I bet. Okay, um...

05:38.338 --> 05:40.508
-I'm gonna head out.
-You're welcome to stay.

05:40.541 --> 05:42.510
Maybe God brought you here
for a reason, too.

05:42.543 --> 05:44.211
(laughing):
Well, that's very sweet,

05:44.244 --> 05:45.379
but I brought myself here.

05:45.413 --> 05:47.581
In a Porsche 911 Turbo.

05:47.615 --> 05:50.250
So tell God thank you very much,
but I'm all set.

05:50.283 --> 05:53.186
Gonna go burn off some of that
good karma. Have fun.

05:53.220 --> 05:55.556
So let me, let me ask you
a question.

05:55.589 --> 05:57.725
Are you, like, are you writing
your own stuff,

05:57.758 --> 06:00.027
or are you just, like,
pulling that out of your ass?

06:00.060 --> 06:01.261
Depends on the day.

06:01.294 --> 06:02.930
-Ha!
-(chuckles)

06:07.701 --> 06:09.770
(slurring):
There we go. Oh, yeah.

06:09.803 --> 06:11.605
Hello, you.

06:11.639 --> 06:13.407
I'll take that.

06:13.441 --> 06:15.008
Make a sandwich.

06:15.042 --> 06:16.844
Don't play hard to get with me.

06:16.877 --> 06:18.412
I will find you.

06:18.446 --> 06:20.881
Okay, lettuce there.
I'm healthy.

06:20.914 --> 06:22.583
Let's see...

06:22.616 --> 06:24.518
-Tomato...
-ALBA: Uh, Mickey?

06:24.552 --> 06:26.186
Oh, good Lord.

06:26.219 --> 06:29.690
Alba, you brought home the Lord.

06:29.723 --> 06:32.359
Well, after all that confessing,
it really worked up an appetite,

06:32.392 --> 06:34.628
so I invited Father Zach over
for dinner.

06:34.662 --> 06:36.096
It's so good to see you again.

06:36.129 --> 06:37.865
I'm not drunk.

06:37.898 --> 06:39.199
All right.

06:39.232 --> 06:40.634
You want me
to make you something?

06:40.668 --> 06:43.203
No, I-I want to...
I'm gonna make it.

06:43.236 --> 06:44.572
Ah, it's so late though.

06:44.605 --> 06:45.806
(clearing throat):
Right?

06:45.839 --> 06:48.308
I'm gonna make it in my bed.

06:48.341 --> 06:50.478
-Can I give you a hand with...?
-No, I'm good. I just...

06:56.283 --> 06:58.418
Good evening to you both.

07:01.489 --> 07:03.123
What time is it?

07:03.156 --> 07:04.424
6:00 a.m.

07:04.458 --> 07:06.794
Why are we up?

07:06.827 --> 07:08.829
Well, because we've got
a breakfast date with the Lord.

07:08.862 --> 07:10.798
Really? What's for breakfast?

07:10.831 --> 07:13.567
Well, there isn't any food
per se, but that's all right,

07:13.601 --> 07:16.403
because we are going to feast
on this.

07:16.436 --> 07:18.739
-(waves crashing)
-Huh?

07:18.772 --> 07:21.308
I mean, come on. Tell me that's
not proof of God right there.

07:21.341 --> 07:23.243
-The sunrise?
-Yeah, well...

07:23.276 --> 07:26.514
It's not just a sunrise; I mean,
those blazing oranges

07:26.547 --> 07:29.850
and those simmering pinks,
those brilliant reds...

07:29.883 --> 07:31.485
Who do you think
made those colors?

07:31.519 --> 07:33.754
My teacher said
it's because of smog.

07:33.787 --> 07:35.322
Did God make smog?

07:35.355 --> 07:37.925
Uh... yeah, I guess he did.

07:37.958 --> 07:41.094
-But I thought smog was bad?
-Let's-let's back up.

07:41.128 --> 07:43.196
Humans are responsible for smog.

07:43.230 --> 07:45.432
But then, you know,
God made humans,

07:45.465 --> 07:47.200
so I guess God made smog

07:47.234 --> 07:49.436
and then turned it
into a beautiful sunrise.

07:49.469 --> 07:52.272
So, God kind of makes
everything?

07:52.305 --> 07:53.273
-Exactly.
-Yeah.

07:53.306 --> 07:54.708
-What about trees?
-Yeah.

07:54.742 --> 07:55.709
Dogs?

07:55.743 --> 07:57.811
-Sure.
-What about poop?

07:57.845 --> 07:59.513
Yeah, okay.

07:59.547 --> 08:00.948
Even diarrhea?

08:00.981 --> 08:02.883
You know what? Let's just
leave it here for the day.

08:02.916 --> 08:04.151
Yeah, let's just take a minute

08:04.184 --> 08:07.454
to gather our thoughts
and, for now, enjoy the sunrise.

08:07.487 --> 08:09.389
All right,
I'll stare at the smog.

08:12.325 --> 08:14.127
Ugh, I feel like
I've been hit by a bus.

08:14.161 --> 08:15.863
Ooh.

08:15.896 --> 08:17.698
What's this?

08:17.731 --> 08:19.466
Why, it's Sunday.
(chuckles)

08:19.499 --> 08:21.535
I know how much you like
to watch your football.

08:21.569 --> 08:23.170
-This is all for me?
-Yeah.

08:23.203 --> 08:25.338
Aw, man, that's so sweet.

08:25.372 --> 08:27.207
-I knew a little church
would be good for you. -Ah...

08:27.240 --> 08:28.576
Look at you being
all of service.

08:28.609 --> 08:30.043
-Nah, nah, it's nothing.
-(doorbell rings)

08:30.077 --> 08:34.014
-Ugh. Make it stop.
-Yeah. I-I go get it.

08:34.047 --> 08:36.049
(sportscaster speaking on TV)

08:36.083 --> 08:37.250
(Alba laughs)

08:37.284 --> 08:39.052
Look who's here.

08:40.921 --> 08:42.155
-Hey.
-Hey.

08:42.189 --> 08:44.191
What are you doing?
What's he doing here?

08:44.224 --> 08:45.225
Yeah, I invited him.

08:45.258 --> 08:46.694
You know,
I think that Father Zach

08:46.727 --> 08:48.395
is a bigger Pats fan
than you are. (laughs)

08:48.428 --> 08:51.531
And on the eighth day,
God made Tom Brady.

08:51.565 --> 08:53.000
(laughs nervously)

08:53.033 --> 08:55.002
Yeah.

08:55.035 --> 08:56.770
Isn't football a little rough
for a priest?

08:56.804 --> 08:59.272
With all the concussions
and murderers.

08:59.306 --> 09:01.575
No, the big hits
are the best part of the game.

09:01.609 --> 09:03.543
Plus, these guys are getting
paid millions of dollars.

09:03.577 --> 09:06.580
This CTE business, I mean, they
know what they're getting into.

09:06.614 --> 09:08.181
Plus, they're wearing helmets.

09:08.215 --> 09:11.051
-Hey, does anyone want a beer?
-Mm... (clears throat)

09:11.084 --> 09:12.786
No. No, thank you.

09:12.820 --> 09:14.287
I would love one.

09:14.321 --> 09:15.923
-Is that all right?
-No, here. (laughs)

09:15.956 --> 09:17.591
-I'll get you an opener.
-No, no, no, no.

09:17.625 --> 09:18.959
Got one with me.

09:18.992 --> 09:21.094
Whoa, that's cool.
(laughs)

09:22.996 --> 09:24.798
Father Z?
What are you doing here?

09:24.832 --> 09:26.734
What's up, Chip?
I'm just watching Tom Brady

09:26.767 --> 09:28.435
spread the gospel.
(whistles)

09:28.468 --> 09:30.070
You rocking the new Durants?

09:30.103 --> 09:32.773
Good eye, bro. My vertical's
insane now. You hoop?

09:32.806 --> 09:34.541
I played a little
college ball at UConn,

09:34.574 --> 09:35.776
but I mostly rode the bench.

09:35.809 --> 09:39.112
-You want to shoot around
at halftime? -Hell yeah.

09:39.146 --> 09:42.582
-What a great kid.
-Yeah. (laughs)

09:42.616 --> 09:45.452
Oh, come on, you got to wrap up
on those tackles!

09:45.485 --> 09:47.955
All right, let's go, TB.
Let's get back in this thing.

09:47.988 --> 09:49.256
Yeah, let's go.

09:49.289 --> 09:51.258
Here we go, Pats!

09:51.291 --> 09:53.060
(sportscaster continues speaking
on TV)

09:53.093 --> 09:54.427
All right, Ben.

09:54.461 --> 09:56.596
Sometimes a higher being doesn't
always present itself to you

09:56.630 --> 09:58.231
in a church or a sunset.

09:58.265 --> 10:01.334
A spiritual experience can find
you when you least expect it.

10:01.368 --> 10:04.437
Now, for me, it was
The String Cheese Incident.

10:04.471 --> 10:05.973
Red Rocks, '96.

10:06.006 --> 10:09.342
They played for seven straight
hours in 108 degree heat.

10:09.376 --> 10:12.179
A set so divine
and filled with love

10:12.212 --> 10:14.648
that your little mind
couldn't possibly grasp it

10:14.682 --> 10:15.983
through mere description.

10:16.016 --> 10:19.953
Luckily, big ol' Jimbo
bootlegged it.

10:19.987 --> 10:21.889
(music plays on laptop)

10:25.125 --> 10:26.593
(laughs) Yeah.

10:26.626 --> 10:28.762
This is God?

10:28.796 --> 10:30.597
Well, i-it is if
you're a drug addict

10:30.630 --> 10:32.800
and you like to listen
to 40-minute-long songs

10:32.833 --> 10:35.002
and spin around in circles
until you have a seizure.

10:35.035 --> 10:36.269
(laughs) Shh.

10:36.303 --> 10:37.771
JIMMY (on recording):
Geez, I'm shredded tonight.

10:37.805 --> 10:39.639
-MAN: Let me get some of that K.
-JIMMY: No can do.

10:39.673 --> 10:42.209
-Already took it.
-All of it? Dude, not cool.

10:42.242 --> 10:44.778
-You were supposed to
drive back. -JIMMY: I'm fine.

10:44.812 --> 10:46.546
It doesn't sound very good.

10:46.579 --> 10:49.349
Well, yeah, I mean the speakers
aren't great, you know.

10:49.382 --> 10:50.984
You need a woofer
to really capture

10:51.018 --> 10:52.385
the essence of their sound.

10:52.419 --> 10:53.821
Some ketamine would help, too.

10:53.854 --> 10:55.723
Okay. You know what?
When the glockenspiel comes in,

10:55.756 --> 10:57.324
you're really gonna understand.

10:57.357 --> 11:01.862
No offense, but if this is God,
I don't think I'm a fan.

11:04.397 --> 11:05.398
Yeah, that went well.

11:05.432 --> 11:06.900
If he's not gonna open his mind,

11:06.934 --> 11:09.002
then there's not a lot
I can do for him.

11:09.036 --> 11:10.503
I don't know.
Maybe it's too late.

11:10.537 --> 11:12.539
We're just going
about this too abstract.

11:12.572 --> 11:14.341
You know, I mean, think
about it like Santa Claus.

11:14.374 --> 11:16.043
You don't explain
to a kid the physics

11:16.076 --> 11:18.578
of some fatso cramming his ass

11:18.611 --> 11:20.814
down seven billion chimneys
in a night.

11:20.848 --> 11:21.815
No, of course not.

11:21.849 --> 11:23.250
You-you just drive him
to the mall,

11:23.283 --> 11:25.185
get his picture taken
with some child molester,

11:25.218 --> 11:27.755
and eat a couple of his cookies
before he wakes up.

11:27.788 --> 11:30.423
Ben wants to see God...

11:30.457 --> 11:32.559
let's show him God.

11:38.131 --> 11:41.902
Dude, your stroke is frickin'
wet from behind the arc.

11:41.935 --> 11:43.436
Don't tell me you can dunk, too.

11:43.470 --> 11:46.874
Don't worry, I won't.
I'll just show you.

11:46.907 --> 11:48.375
Oh! Wow!

11:49.877 --> 11:52.179
What?! Oh, my God.

11:52.212 --> 11:53.446
How did you do that?

11:53.480 --> 11:55.849
It's hot out here, man.

11:55.883 --> 11:57.050
Damn!

11:57.084 --> 11:58.685
Father's got mad ink.

11:58.718 --> 11:59.953
You look like
frickin' John Wick.

11:59.987 --> 12:02.055
I didn't know priests
could get tatted up like that.

12:02.089 --> 12:03.791
Yeah, it sounds like
you got some misconceptions

12:03.824 --> 12:04.892
about the church.

12:04.925 --> 12:06.093
You think it's all
sinners and judgment.

12:06.126 --> 12:08.095
But the way I see it,
every Sunday,

12:08.128 --> 12:09.529
God throws
a kick-ass house party

12:09.562 --> 12:10.764
and all the sinners are invited.

12:10.798 --> 12:12.399
I mean, I-I will admit,

12:12.432 --> 12:14.701
-it does look cool to be
center stage like that. -Yeah.

12:14.734 --> 12:16.136
You must feel like
a frickin' rock star.

12:16.169 --> 12:18.605
No, no, no, no.
God's the real rock star.

12:18.638 --> 12:22.109
I just feel like I'm a DJ
remixing his hottest jams.

12:22.142 --> 12:25.245
(laughs)

12:25.278 --> 12:27.047
That's all right.
That's all right.

12:27.080 --> 12:28.982
-Yeah.
-You know what?

12:29.016 --> 12:30.918
I did have an altar boy
drop out this weekend.

12:30.951 --> 12:32.419
If you feel like
subbing on Sunday.

12:32.452 --> 12:35.455
Uh... no-no offense,

12:35.488 --> 12:38.458
but those white dresses are...
are kind of lame.

12:38.491 --> 12:40.460
You know, when you're up there,

12:40.493 --> 12:43.730
you're feeling all that energy,
it doesn't matter what you wear.

12:43.763 --> 12:45.732
You're cloaked
in God's love, son.

12:45.765 --> 12:46.867
Off the glass.

12:48.335 --> 12:49.302
(squeals):
Whoa!

12:51.538 --> 12:52.672
(beer can opens)

12:54.842 --> 12:57.177
ALBA:
Mickey?

12:58.311 --> 12:59.346
What is going on?

12:59.379 --> 13:01.014
You don't just sneak up
on somebody... (burps)

13:01.048 --> 13:02.482
like that, you know what I mean?

13:02.515 --> 13:04.784
If you wanted a beer,
why didn't you just say so?

13:04.818 --> 13:06.854
Because I can't be myself
in front of that guy.

13:06.887 --> 13:08.288
He makes me uncomfortable.

13:08.321 --> 13:09.756
It's like driving next to a cop.

13:09.789 --> 13:11.959
-Well, he's just a priest.
-He's not.

13:11.992 --> 13:13.526
-He's not just a priest.
-Well...

13:13.560 --> 13:15.362
Priests don't wear normal
clothes and play basketball.

13:15.395 --> 13:17.865
They're old and ugly
and mean and boring.

13:17.898 --> 13:20.467
-You are the one who told me
to go to him. -Yes.

13:20.500 --> 13:21.935
I told you to go to him.

13:21.969 --> 13:24.437
Maybe once or something,
not bring him in here.

13:24.471 --> 13:25.939
I think you are overreacting.

13:25.973 --> 13:27.174
Okay, well, how's this
for overreacting?

13:27.207 --> 13:28.842
I forbid you
to ever see him again.

13:28.876 --> 13:30.377
-Mm-hmm.
-Father Zach

13:30.410 --> 13:32.312
has been so helpful to me
in my darkest hour.

13:32.345 --> 13:33.613
That's what they do.

13:33.646 --> 13:34.982
They find the weakest person
they can

13:35.015 --> 13:37.851
-and make them feel like
the chosen one. -CHIP: Yo!

13:37.885 --> 13:40.954
Guess who Father Z hand-selected
to be his new altar boy?

13:40.988 --> 13:42.155
This guy!

13:42.189 --> 13:43.523
-(laughs)
-Hey, now!

13:43.556 --> 13:45.492
Let's just hope he praises
better than he dribbles.

13:45.525 --> 13:47.394
-(both laugh)
-You're right.

13:47.427 --> 13:49.963
-I got to work on that. -You're
doing okay. You're doing okay.

13:49.997 --> 13:53.066
-Ah, it could be better. Oh!
-ALBA: That's good. Oh!

13:53.100 --> 13:55.802
-That's tight, huh?
-Such a great-- whoa! Ah!

13:55.835 --> 13:56.904
(laughing)

13:56.937 --> 13:59.339
Look it, I got it.
And I gave it back.

14:04.077 --> 14:05.745
-Father McCormick?
-Yes.

14:05.778 --> 14:07.014
Hi, I'm Mickey,
new to your parish.

14:07.047 --> 14:08.048
Do you have a second?

14:08.081 --> 14:11.551
-Yes, please come in.
-Thank you.

14:11.584 --> 14:13.853
Listen, um,

14:13.887 --> 14:15.889
I got a problem
with one of your priests.

14:17.124 --> 14:18.525
N-Not a kid problem.

14:18.558 --> 14:20.693
Oh, no, sorry.
It's about Father Zach.

14:20.727 --> 14:23.530
He's not who he says he is.

14:23.563 --> 14:25.365
That man is leading
a double life.

14:25.398 --> 14:28.668
I see. Uh, please, go on.

14:28.701 --> 14:30.003
Just yesterday, in my home,

14:30.037 --> 14:33.440
I watched him drink
upwards of two beers.

14:33.473 --> 14:36.176
Oh. Well, there's nothing
wrong with that.

14:36.209 --> 14:38.378
You sure about that?

14:38.411 --> 14:41.381
-Oh, I'm quite certain.
-(drawer opens)

14:41.414 --> 14:45.953
Nothing wrong
with an occasional libation.

14:45.986 --> 14:48.188
Oh.

14:48.221 --> 14:49.422
Would you?

14:49.456 --> 14:51.258
Is it a trick?

14:51.291 --> 14:53.460
-No.
-Oh.

14:53.493 --> 14:55.195
Thank you.

14:55.228 --> 14:58.398
Well, he was definitely
not wearing his uniform.

14:58.431 --> 15:00.267
That's got to be
some sort of infraction.

15:00.300 --> 15:02.769
Well, I don't think that is.
No, no.

15:02.802 --> 15:05.705
I'm sorry, is there something
I can help you with?

15:05.738 --> 15:08.775
Yes, you can, you can help me
get rid of the guy, you know.

15:08.808 --> 15:10.377
I-I don't like him.

15:10.410 --> 15:13.313
I-I... he rubs me the wrong way
and something's off.

15:13.346 --> 15:16.916
Look, between you and me,
I'm also not a fan.

15:16.950 --> 15:19.452
But unfortunately,
there's nothing I can do.

15:19.486 --> 15:22.089
What are you talking about?
You're the pastor.

15:22.122 --> 15:23.923
You know, you're the boss
around here.

15:23.957 --> 15:27.294
N-Not the boss-boss, but-but
you're pretty high up there.

15:27.327 --> 15:28.461
It's not that simple.

15:28.495 --> 15:30.998
Since Zachary joined our parish,

15:31.031 --> 15:33.900
we've had quite
the spike in donations.

15:33.933 --> 15:36.769
I see.

15:36.803 --> 15:38.105
(laughs) Okay.

15:38.138 --> 15:39.506
So it's a money thing.

15:39.539 --> 15:41.508
Now you're speaking my language.

15:41.541 --> 15:44.944
(clears throat)

15:44.978 --> 15:46.779
Here you go.

15:46.813 --> 15:47.914
What's that?

15:47.947 --> 15:49.816
That's a Porsche 911 Turbo.

15:49.849 --> 15:51.484
Got a quarter tank of gas
and it's parked

15:51.518 --> 15:54.321
right out front in a handicapped
spot, nice and easy for you.

15:54.354 --> 15:56.589
Well, that's very kind,
but I'm not quite sure

15:56.623 --> 15:58.525
what the church would do
with a Porsche.

15:58.558 --> 16:00.527
I myself rarely drive.

16:00.560 --> 16:02.595
Eh, you'll pick it right up
or sell it for parts.

16:02.629 --> 16:04.631
Hell, drive it straight
to heaven for all I care.

16:04.664 --> 16:06.266
Just please transfer him.

16:06.299 --> 16:10.203
Well, there is an opening
in Baltimore.

16:10.237 --> 16:11.638
Baltimore.

16:11.671 --> 16:13.006
Love Baltimore.

16:13.040 --> 16:14.807
Beautiful city. Stone crabs.

16:14.841 --> 16:16.809
Well, I don't know.

16:16.843 --> 16:18.478
Oh, come on.

16:18.511 --> 16:20.213
Give yourself a little credit.

16:20.247 --> 16:22.215
I think you do know.

16:22.249 --> 16:23.516
But don't do it for me.

16:23.550 --> 16:27.187
Do it for this guy.

16:27.220 --> 16:28.655
I'll leave you two alone.

16:28.688 --> 16:30.523
Mull it over.

16:32.659 --> 16:34.694
(organ playing)

16:34.727 --> 16:37.964
* Áve *

16:37.997 --> 16:42.535
* Maria

16:45.004 --> 16:49.476
* Grátia pléna...

16:49.509 --> 16:52.412
JIMMY (whispering):
Mick.

16:52.445 --> 16:56.483
ALBA and ZACH:
* Maria grátia pléna...

16:56.516 --> 16:58.085
(whispering):
What are you doing here?

16:58.118 --> 16:59.652
Just came to enjoy the show.

16:59.686 --> 17:01.521
Got a feeling it's gonna be
a good one.

17:01.554 --> 17:05.058
Ah, you bet your sweet
little ass it is.

17:05.092 --> 17:06.893
Okay. How you doing, buddy?

17:06.926 --> 17:09.062
Good. Even though God
isn't real,

17:09.096 --> 17:10.863
I still like the songs
and stuff.

17:10.897 --> 17:12.332
Nice.

17:12.365 --> 17:14.434
Oh, I wouldn't be
so sure about that.

17:14.467 --> 17:17.003
You keep your eyes peeled,
you might just see him.

17:17.036 --> 17:18.371
Yeah.

17:18.405 --> 17:20.006
I-I'm having second thoughts.

17:20.039 --> 17:21.574
Yeah, don't be nervous.

17:21.608 --> 17:23.610
I'm not nervous.

17:23.643 --> 17:25.011
It's just an idiotic plan.

17:25.044 --> 17:26.045
Okay, you know what?

17:26.079 --> 17:27.414
We're here, so we're doing it.

17:30.083 --> 17:32.018
ZACH:
Thank you, Alba.

17:32.051 --> 17:34.020
That sounded so beautiful.

17:34.053 --> 17:36.923
Before we begin,
I have some unfortunate news

17:36.956 --> 17:38.425
to share with all of you.

17:38.458 --> 17:40.627
(quietly): Yeah.
Enjoy Baltimore, bitch.

17:40.660 --> 17:42.295
(snickers)

17:42.329 --> 17:45.031
Father McCormick was
in a car accident last night.

17:45.064 --> 17:47.767
-(people gasp)
-He drove a Porsche into a pond.

17:47.800 --> 17:49.736
Uh, miraculously, he survived.

17:49.769 --> 17:51.771
Oh, come on, old man.

17:51.804 --> 17:53.873
So let's please all keep him
in our prayers.

17:53.906 --> 17:55.542
-Oh...
-And in the meantime,

17:55.575 --> 17:57.644
I will be serving
as your head pastor.

17:57.677 --> 18:00.046
Oh, well, this is just great.

18:00.079 --> 18:03.550
For today's sermon, I'd like
to talk to you about temptation.

18:03.583 --> 18:06.386
It's everywhere, folks.

18:06.419 --> 18:09.289
Serpents slither among us

18:09.322 --> 18:11.057
and takes many forms.

18:11.090 --> 18:13.760
-(scoffs)
-Apparent strangers, coworkers,

18:13.793 --> 18:17.096
even so-called friends.

18:17.130 --> 18:19.632
Okay, okay. You can stop
dancing around.

18:19.666 --> 18:22.001
-I'm the serpent he's talking
about. -(people murmuring)

18:22.034 --> 18:23.836
I'm the one who
gave McCormick the Porsche.

18:23.870 --> 18:25.805
Wha...? Why would you do that?

18:25.838 --> 18:27.774
So he would cast this man
out of our lives

18:27.807 --> 18:29.409
and into the fiery streets
of Baltimore.

18:29.442 --> 18:30.943
Damn it, Mickey.

18:30.977 --> 18:32.845
-Those aren't your cars to give.
-Silence, Sabrina!

18:32.879 --> 18:36.516
You, Father "Z,"
you're the real serpent.

18:36.549 --> 18:38.785
Just slither around my house,

18:38.818 --> 18:41.621
being all casual about religion,
not taking it seriously.

18:41.654 --> 18:43.156
ZACH:
I take it very seriously.

18:43.190 --> 18:44.491
-MICKEY: Oh, yeah?
-Yeah, I'm a priest.

18:44.524 --> 18:46.593
Well, whoever you are, Zach,

18:46.626 --> 18:48.261
beer-drinking basketball buddy.

18:48.295 --> 18:51.498
Yeah, whatever mask
you choose to wear right now.

18:51.531 --> 18:52.932
You've turned my friend
into something

18:52.965 --> 18:54.367
I don't even recognize anymore.

18:54.401 --> 18:57.036
She has a very serious
drinking problem.

18:57.069 --> 18:59.506
Okay, well, now she has
a very serious church problem.

18:59.539 --> 19:01.140
You don't see you just took
one addiction

19:01.174 --> 19:02.642
and replaced it with another?

19:02.675 --> 19:04.344
I'm just trying not to die.

19:04.377 --> 19:06.379
Well, news flash:
you are gonna die.

19:06.413 --> 19:08.014
-You're all gonna die.
-(people gasping)

19:08.047 --> 19:10.149
-MAN: What? -Not, I mean,
not right now. I'm not gonna...

19:10.183 --> 19:12.485
That's not what I meant.
You're safe... for now.

19:12.519 --> 19:13.520
I'm not gonna do anything.

19:13.553 --> 19:15.888
(sighs)

19:18.358 --> 19:21.561
She's right. This is idiotic.

19:21.594 --> 19:23.830
If you accept God
into your heart,

19:23.863 --> 19:26.065
you'll walk with him
in the kingdom of heaven.

19:26.098 --> 19:28.868
Oh, yeah? Okay, cool.
You got proof of that?

19:28.901 --> 19:31.504
-I see proof of God every day.
-Do you?

19:31.538 --> 19:33.206
I-I-I can't wait to see it.

19:33.240 --> 19:36.142
Show me. Please.
Excited to see the proof.

19:36.175 --> 19:37.744
Go ahead. Let's see it.

19:37.777 --> 19:40.347
-(flame roars)
-Aah! Oh.

19:40.380 --> 19:41.714
Ooh, that's hot. Oh, my...

19:41.748 --> 19:43.416
(screams)

19:43.450 --> 19:45.585
How can you just stand there?
I'm on fire!

19:45.618 --> 19:46.753
I'm on fire!

19:46.786 --> 19:49.188
Oh, my God!

19:49.222 --> 19:51.524
-(Mickey screams)
-(people gasping)

19:51.558 --> 19:53.893
-Oh, no. Oh, no!
-(Jimmy grunting)

19:58.698 --> 20:01.568
(shouting)

20:04.971 --> 20:07.940
(deep voice):
Stay in school, Ben.

20:15.214 --> 20:17.284
(gasps)

20:17.317 --> 20:19.252
She's awake.

20:19.286 --> 20:21.421
I'm alive?

20:21.454 --> 20:23.723
-By the grace of God.
-BEN: It was so cool.

20:23.756 --> 20:26.759
God smited you because
you were being blasphemous,

20:26.793 --> 20:30.263
but then he saved you because
he's merciful and forgiving,

20:30.297 --> 20:32.299
but then, he pointed right at me

20:32.332 --> 20:34.767
and told me to work extra hard
in school.

20:34.801 --> 20:37.737
And now, I'm gonna be the Pope
when I grow up.

20:37.770 --> 20:41.308
(quietly): Okay, we might've
laid too strong of a foundation.

20:41.341 --> 20:43.710
I mean, he literally witnessed
God perform a miracle.

20:43.743 --> 20:46.479
(quietly): Yeah, we can blow
that up in about two seconds.

20:46.513 --> 20:47.747
I think I'm done with church.

20:47.780 --> 20:49.382
You know, I got way too extreme.

20:49.416 --> 20:50.783
I got to stop that.

20:50.817 --> 20:52.452
From now on,
I'm just gonna be chill.

20:52.485 --> 20:53.986
I'm just gonna be super chill.

20:54.020 --> 20:55.822
I'm gonna start meditating,
doing yoga.

20:55.855 --> 20:57.657
All right, Alba, you're getting
extreme about being chill.

20:57.690 --> 20:59.125
It's happening again.

20:59.158 --> 21:01.394
Yeah, you're right.
I got to chill out.

21:01.428 --> 21:02.662
Yeah, I think I'm done
with church, too.

21:02.695 --> 21:03.830
Father Z's just a bummer.

21:03.863 --> 21:05.164
Such a waste of talent.

21:05.197 --> 21:06.966
He could be out there
waxing ass,

21:06.999 --> 21:09.235
but instead he's like, "No, we
just feed bread to old people."

21:09.268 --> 21:10.437
Forget that place.

21:10.470 --> 21:12.505
Mm. I don't know.

21:12.539 --> 21:13.940
I might go back.

21:13.973 --> 21:15.342
What?

21:15.375 --> 21:18.277
I-I feel like I've been reborn,
you know?

21:18.311 --> 21:22.682
Like I've gotten a-a new lease
on life and...

21:22.715 --> 21:26.853
(sighs) if that's not proof
of God, I don't know what is.

21:26.886 --> 21:28.755
Yeah, it's either that
or the morphine.

21:28.788 --> 21:30.357
Hmm?

21:30.390 --> 21:32.124
They've been pumping you
full of that stuff for hours.

21:32.158 --> 21:33.426
I told them not to hold back.

21:33.460 --> 21:35.695
She can take it.

21:35.728 --> 21:38.130
Oh, that's nice.

21:38.164 --> 21:41.601
Okay, well, Alba, be an angel
and, uh, hit me again.

21:41.634 --> 21:43.970
-Yeah, I got you. I got you.
-(button beeps)

21:44.003 --> 21:46.973
-There you go.
-Mmm.

21:50.543 --> 21:52.078
CHIP:
This guy! (laughs)

21:56.583 --> 21:58.551
Hope you
enjoyed
kickin' it
with The Mick.

21:58.585 --> 22:00.853
Now here are a few more shows
to check out from Fox.

22:03.222 --> 22:04.791
It's time we fly
this old bird.

22:04.824 --> 22:07.727
* It feels good *

22:07.760 --> 22:10.663
MULDER: I want to believe.
I would just like to see.

22:10.697 --> 22:11.464
I can help you.

22:11.498 --> 22:13.466
* It feels good *

22:13.500 --> 22:15.067
-You want to do
the honors, Alan?
-Yeah!

22:15.101 --> 22:16.469
No, you never
touch this.

22:16.503 --> 22:18.237
* You know it feels good *

22:18.270 --> 22:19.872
-(shrieks)
-* It feels good *

22:19.906 --> 22:21.841
* Oh, you know it feels good *

22:21.874 --> 22:23.910
Let's do it.

22:23.943 --> 22:26.245
Everything you thought
you knew about medicine
is wrong.

22:29.382 --> 22:30.316
Unbelievable.

22:30.349 --> 22:31.918
* It feels good *
