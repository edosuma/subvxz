WEBVTT

00:19.253 --> 00:20.754
I'm right here,
Marisol.

00:21.887 --> 00:23.220
Right next to you.

00:24.554 --> 00:26.487
Don't ever leave me.

00:26.554 --> 00:27.587
Never.

00:45.280 --> 00:45.347
CAINE:
What happened?
A car's
blocking the way.

00:47.014 --> 00:48.248
They're not moving.
I don't understand.

00:50.881 --> 00:51.881
They're here for me.

00:53.047 --> 00:54.114
I'm getting out.

00:54.181 --> 00:56.514
Sweetheart, I have
to get out here.

00:56.580 --> 00:57.814
They'll take you
to the hospital,

00:57.881 --> 00:59.313
but I'll meet you
there, all right?

00:59.380 --> 01:01.248
You hang in there.

01:10.514 --> 01:12.081
We can spend
a weekend in the country.

01:12.148 --> 01:13.181
It'll be great.

01:15.547 --> 01:19.081
So are you happy with
your new husband?

01:19.148 --> 01:20.714
Yeah.

01:23.280 --> 01:26.380
Marisol, there's something
I have to tell you.

01:28.248 --> 01:29.380
This officer will be

01:29.447 --> 01:31.148
escorting you
until the trial is over.

01:33.480 --> 01:35.114
I don't understand.

01:35.181 --> 01:37.480
These are very, very
dangerous people.

01:37.547 --> 01:39.114
Anyone connected
to this case

01:39.181 --> 01:42.347
must have police protection,
including families.

01:43.680 --> 01:45.714
So this is what
remission feels like.

01:45.781 --> 01:49.181
I need to remind you that you
fought and you won, didn't you?

01:49.248 --> 01:51.947
Yeah.

01:53.280 --> 01:55.114
Listen, tonight
I was thinking...

01:55.881 --> 01:56.747
Casa... Tua?

01:56.814 --> 01:58.514
Casa Tua. Sounds good.

01:58.580 --> 01:59.981
Are you up?

02:00.047 --> 02:02.114
I'm up.

02:05.781 --> 02:06.781
See you later?

02:06.847 --> 02:08.047
I'll see you tonight.

02:08.114 --> 02:09.580
Love you.

02:09.646 --> 02:11.347
I love you.

02:11.413 --> 02:13.380
You, uh...

02:13.447 --> 02:15.313
You don't let her out
of your sight, right?

02:16.747 --> 02:19.647
CSI Wolfe, what exactly
is your role in this case?

02:19.714 --> 02:20.781
I processed

02:20.847 --> 02:22.347
the firearm evidence
on the day

02:22.413 --> 02:24.248
the Mala Noches
were apprehended.

02:24.313 --> 02:26.714
Can you confirm that
this was the weapon

02:26.781 --> 02:28.614
seized from the defendant
Raphael Sifuentes

02:28.680 --> 02:30.580
on the afternoon of the
shootout at the Quarry?

02:31.647 --> 02:32.580
Get on the ground!

02:32.647 --> 02:33.680
Get on the ground! Now!

02:35.647 --> 02:37.081
Move! Move! Move!

02:37.148 --> 02:39.214
So, Raphael,

02:39.280 --> 02:41.081
you and your buddies
shot up the cemetery

02:41.148 --> 02:43.680
and then broke
into the Livingston house.

02:43.747 --> 02:46.148
You got some
good story there, B.

02:47.747 --> 02:48.914
Yes.

02:48.981 --> 02:50.181
I can.

02:50.248 --> 02:51.847
Thank you.

02:51.914 --> 02:54.747
The Prosecution
calls Antonio Riaz.

02:54.814 --> 02:56.781
BAILIFF:
Do you swear to tell
the truth, the whole truth...

02:56.847 --> 02:59.280
<i>You're a Mala Noche member,</i>

02:59.347 --> 03:00.313
correct, Mr. Riaz?

03:00.380 --> 03:02.047
Yeah.
And yet,

03:02.114 --> 03:03.081
you're testifying
against them.

03:03.148 --> 03:04.081
Couldn't that
get you killed?

03:04.148 --> 03:05.981
I need to do the right thing.

03:06.047 --> 03:09.280
Is this the gun you
gave to Mr. Sifuentes?

03:09.347 --> 03:10.647
You're a dead man, Riaz!

03:10.714 --> 03:12.480
You hear me? A dead man!

03:16.981 --> 03:19.413
I ask you again.

03:19.480 --> 03:21.614
Is this the gun?

03:21.680 --> 03:25.614
I-I-I'm not sure.

03:25.680 --> 03:28.248
You're saying
this isn't the gun?

03:28.347 --> 03:32.313
No, I-I don't think it is.

03:32.380 --> 03:35.747
But you stated to detectives
that it was, Mr. Riaz.

03:35.814 --> 03:37.647
Can-Can I see it again?

03:37.714 --> 03:39.214
Maybe, maybe
I didn't see it right.

03:53.514 --> 03:54.347
Head's up!

04:03.214 --> 04:05.181
Security 911! Bailiff!

04:06.714 --> 04:08.580
Code 73. Security,
Courtroom 12, stat.

04:26.347 --> 04:28.847
Lieutenant Caine.

04:28.914 --> 04:32.047
You help me and I'll help you.

04:32.114 --> 04:33.680
You're already dead, brother.

04:37.148 --> 04:39.380
Join the club.

05:32.294 --> 05:33.594
How many people were killed?

05:33.660 --> 05:34.961
Were any of the assailants
foreign nationals?

05:35.027 --> 05:37.328
What sort of leads
do you have in this case?

05:37.393 --> 05:39.427
<i>Has the bailiff's family
been notified?</i>

05:39.493 --> 05:41.094
Horatio.

05:41.161 --> 05:42.493
The fugitives are

05:42.560 --> 05:45.194
Raphael Sifuentes
and Antonio Riaz,

05:45.261 --> 05:47.094
both Noches,
both dangerous.

05:47.161 --> 05:48.094
Who's the shooter?

05:48.161 --> 05:49.328
Jose Torillo,

05:49.393 --> 05:50.794
farther down
the Noche food chain.

05:50.861 --> 05:53.460
Frank, it looks like
the witness faked testimony

05:53.527 --> 05:55.094
to get close to the gun.

05:55.161 --> 05:56.794
We put out a BOLO
on the escape vehicle.

05:56.861 --> 05:57.794
We're blanketing the city.

05:57.861 --> 06:00.127
We've gotta find them.

06:12.794 --> 06:13.994
Great.

06:18.827 --> 06:20.194
Eric.

06:20.261 --> 06:22.493
Your girlfriend just
broke my window.

06:22.560 --> 06:23.827
Hey, hey, slow down.
What girlfriend?

06:23.894 --> 06:24.894
What window?

06:24.961 --> 06:26.360
My car window.
Gloria broke it.

06:26.427 --> 06:28.493
You're sure it was Gloria?
Who else?

06:28.560 --> 06:30.594
She called me the entire
time we were seeing each other.

06:30.660 --> 06:32.061
She's, like,
the hang-up queen.

06:32.127 --> 06:33.627
Somebody might want to tell
her about caller ID..

06:33.694 --> 06:35.161
All right, look.
I'm gonna call her

06:35.228 --> 06:36.493
and tell her to back off.

06:36.560 --> 06:38.527
Well, I dealt with this
when we were together.

06:38.594 --> 06:40.161
But now? I mean, seriously,

06:40.228 --> 06:42.560
I don't even know how you
put up with somebody so crazy.

06:42.627 --> 06:44.027
I've told you, I didn't.

06:44.094 --> 06:45.627
I went out with her
a few times.

06:45.694 --> 06:47.061
She's crazy, I moved on.

06:47.127 --> 06:48.660
Well, somebody didn't
give her that message

06:48.727 --> 06:50.393
and now she owes
me a window.

06:50.460 --> 06:51.827
I said I will take care of it.

06:51.894 --> 06:54.194
Yeah, I mean, you better.

06:59.994 --> 07:01.660
All right,
well we know

07:01.727 --> 07:03.594
how the gun
got in here,

07:03.660 --> 07:05.894
but evidence is cleared
before it's stored.

07:05.961 --> 07:09.194
So I guess the question is
how'd the bullets get in here?

07:09.261 --> 07:11.427
SWAT checked the courtroom,
didn't they?

07:11.493 --> 07:12.894
Yeah, it was swept
immediately before

07:12.961 --> 07:14.360
the trial started--
everything was clean.

07:14.427 --> 07:16.228
Well, it got dirty.

07:16.294 --> 07:17.294
Where was the shooter sitting?

07:17.360 --> 07:18.460
Over there.

07:26.827 --> 07:28.061
Packing tape.

07:28.127 --> 07:31.094
A loaded magazine was
taped under there.

07:31.161 --> 07:33.393
Our shooter knew exactly
where to find it.

07:33.460 --> 07:36.827
<i>BAILIFF:
Do you swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth,</i>

07:36.894 --> 07:40.228
<i>and nothing but the truth
so help you God?</i>

07:41.527 --> 07:43.927
But who put it there
for him to find?

07:43.994 --> 07:45.894
Someone on the inside.

07:47.061 --> 07:48.228
Let me see the tape,

07:48.294 --> 07:50.560
I'll have Delko
check it for prints.

08:24.460 --> 08:25.560
Got something?

08:25.627 --> 08:26.961
Yeah.

08:27.027 --> 08:29.161
Let's hope it leads
to something else.

08:29.228 --> 08:31.527
I heard you're
having girl trouble.

08:31.594 --> 08:34.360
Everyone hears everything
in this place?

08:34.427 --> 08:36.894
Yeah. Still, is
the rumor true?

08:38.927 --> 08:40.493
You remember Gloria?

08:41.527 --> 08:44.460
Oh, the crazy one.

08:44.527 --> 08:46.161
She was into Raike massage.

08:46.228 --> 08:47.827
Uh-huh, and skydiving.

08:47.894 --> 08:49.427
And hunting if I recall.

08:49.493 --> 08:50.861
That's quite
a potent combination.

08:50.927 --> 08:52.393
Yeah, well it didn't
hurt that she looked

08:52.460 --> 08:53.627
the way she did, either.

08:53.694 --> 08:55.094
Yeah, well,
see that's the problem.

08:55.161 --> 08:57.660
You love crazy
until crazy loves you.

08:57.727 --> 09:00.161
Well, crazy has messed with

09:00.228 --> 09:01.694
every girl
I've been with since.

09:01.760 --> 09:04.360
And I think she just
busted up Boa Vista's car.

09:04.427 --> 09:06.294
So I've got to put a stop to it.

09:06.360 --> 09:10.794
My advice: talk to her
once as Eric Delko.

09:10.861 --> 09:12.393
And then?

09:12.460 --> 09:14.061
Talk to her again as a cop.

09:15.194 --> 09:16.894
I like you,
you're ruthless.

09:18.194 --> 09:19.694
Take a look.

09:19.760 --> 09:21.894
It's from the courthouse
employees' database.

09:23.094 --> 09:25.027
DUQUESNE:
Alan Parker,

09:25.094 --> 09:26.660
the janitor at the courthouse.

09:27.127 --> 09:28.793
That's their inside man.

09:31.427 --> 09:33.628
You have to understand, okay.

09:33.694 --> 09:34.960
They threatened me.

09:35.027 --> 09:36.628
DUQUESNE:
A bailiff was was killed

09:36.694 --> 09:38.094
as a result of your actions.

09:38.160 --> 09:39.461
And that's so far;
there's still

09:39.527 --> 09:40.661
two dangerous
killers out there.

09:40.728 --> 09:42.394
They knew my daughters' names.

09:42.461 --> 09:43.960
Their schools, their friends.

09:44.027 --> 09:46.060
They said I'd never
see them again.

09:46.127 --> 09:47.494
So you cooperated.

09:47.561 --> 09:49.227
I had to.

09:49.294 --> 09:52.661
Look, all right, I'm sorry
that people got hurt.

09:52.728 --> 09:54.561
But I still have
a family, okay?

09:54.628 --> 09:55.927
I kept them safe.

09:55.994 --> 09:57.327
Who approached you?

09:57.394 --> 09:59.594
Some guy,
some Latino guy.

10:01.394 --> 10:03.494
Was it this guy?

10:03.561 --> 10:05.893
Um, yeah. Yeah, that's the guy.

10:05.960 --> 10:08.827
It's Truillo. It's a dead end.

10:08.893 --> 10:10.694
CALLEIGH:
How'd you get
into the courthouse

10:10.760 --> 10:12.527
after SWAT swept and secured it?

10:12.594 --> 10:14.694
About five minutes
into the trial,

10:14.760 --> 10:16.261
one of the gallery members
got sick.

10:16.327 --> 10:19.461
So they cleared the court
while I cleaned it.

10:19.527 --> 10:22.361
<i>JUDGE:
Ten minute recess;
jurors are to remain</i>

10:22.427 --> 10:24.060
<i>in the break area
pending notification.</i>

10:32.827 --> 10:34.728
Five minutes in,
that's not a coincidence.

10:34.793 --> 10:36.927
Do you still have
what you cleaned up?

10:36.994 --> 10:38.494
Um, yeah.

10:38.561 --> 10:40.827
I mean, it's-it's still
in the janitor's closet.

10:40.893 --> 10:43.394
Could help us find another
piece of the puzzle.

10:43.461 --> 10:45.494
You're gonna make me
collect that, aren't you?

10:45.561 --> 10:46.793
Mm-hmm.

10:46.860 --> 10:48.527
Rank has its privileges.

10:50.561 --> 10:52.361
I came as soon as you called.

10:52.427 --> 10:53.728
Gloria,

10:53.793 --> 10:55.694
if you're going to call
and bother people, okay,

10:55.760 --> 10:57.327
I'd appreciate it
if you just called me.

10:57.394 --> 10:58.893
You miss me?

10:58.960 --> 11:01.427
No, I don't.

11:01.494 --> 11:03.427
Well, that's good.

11:03.494 --> 11:05.027
'Cause what would
your wife think?

11:05.094 --> 11:06.094
My wife?

11:06.160 --> 11:07.327
What are you
talking about?

11:07.394 --> 11:09.294
Oh, that's sweet.

11:09.361 --> 11:11.793
It still feels weird
to say it, huh?

11:11.860 --> 11:12.994
Wife.

11:13.060 --> 11:14.227
What, are you crazy?

11:14.294 --> 11:15.694
You see a ring on my finger?

11:15.760 --> 11:20.227
Guy like you won't wear a ring.

11:20.294 --> 11:22.694
Or maybe he
doesn't want to.

11:24.227 --> 11:26.860
I saw you at the courthouse.

11:26.927 --> 11:28.127
You've been following me?

11:29.760 --> 11:31.760
Well, I got news for you:
that was my sister.

11:31.827 --> 11:33.094
She got married.

11:33.160 --> 11:34.927
You told me
you didn't have siblings.

11:34.994 --> 11:36.860
I didn't tell you
a lot of things, Gloria.

11:36.927 --> 11:39.594
You know why? Because with you,
information is dangerous.

11:39.661 --> 11:43.327
With me, a lot of things
are dangerous.

11:43.394 --> 11:45.927
You come near me
or anyone that I know,

11:45.994 --> 11:47.561
and I'm going to arrest you.

11:47.628 --> 11:53.127
Mm...

12:00.661 --> 12:03.927
So, guess what I found
in my pile of puke.

12:03.994 --> 12:05.094
Do I have to?

12:05.160 --> 12:06.628
Coal.

12:06.694 --> 12:08.127
And...?

12:08.194 --> 12:09.261
And it's the active
ingredient in ipecac.

12:09.327 --> 12:11.060
Ipecac.
Induces vomiting.

12:11.127 --> 12:12.394
It also confirms

12:12.461 --> 12:14.394
that our puker was in on
the courthouse shootout.

12:14.461 --> 12:16.927
It was a diversionary tactic.

12:16.994 --> 12:18.561
So this, my friend, is for you.

12:18.628 --> 12:20.361
A vial of bile.

12:20.427 --> 12:21.628
You're too good to me.

12:21.694 --> 12:23.793
The force of vomit
scrapes the esophagus,

12:23.860 --> 12:26.827
taking bits of the puker's skin
along with his stomach content.

12:26.893 --> 12:28.760
I'll let you know
if I find a conspirator.

12:28.827 --> 12:30.027
Thank you.

13:05.893 --> 13:07.793
What?

13:07.860 --> 13:09.461
So you're the upchuck
specialist.

13:09.527 --> 13:11.760
Didn't think we'd find
you, did you, Benito?

13:11.827 --> 13:13.361
Didn't know you guys
were looking.

13:13.427 --> 13:15.194
You were at the courthouse
today, weren't you, Benito,

13:15.261 --> 13:17.394
helping bust out Sifuentes?

13:20.194 --> 13:22.094
Clear the court.
Ten minute recess.

13:22.160 --> 13:24.261
I'm happy to have the rep.
Yeah, well,
you're not

13:24.327 --> 13:25.860
gonna be too happy
where you're headed.

13:25.927 --> 13:28.527
So you want me to snitch, huh?

13:28.594 --> 13:30.027
Like Antonio Riaz?

13:30.094 --> 13:31.327
Where is he Benito?

13:31.394 --> 13:32.860
And Raphael Sifuentes?

13:32.927 --> 13:34.827
Hey, you'll never find them.

13:34.893 --> 13:36.594
So that tells me
one thing, Benito.
What?

13:36.661 --> 13:37.793
You know where they are.

13:37.860 --> 13:39.227
So where are they?

13:42.060 --> 13:43.694
Not saying.

13:43.760 --> 13:45.827
Well, then let me tell you
where you'll find yourself--

13:45.893 --> 13:48.494
in lockup, tagged with a rep
as a snitch.

13:48.561 --> 13:49.661
What?

13:49.728 --> 13:50.728
But I didn't say nothing.

13:50.793 --> 13:52.227
Not yet.

13:53.527 --> 13:56.728
I assume you can write.

14:00.527 --> 14:01.527
Let's go.

14:14.827 --> 14:17.094
TRIPP:
Japanese restaurant?

14:17.160 --> 14:18.760
That's a good front.

14:18.827 --> 14:20.793
Outside of Noche territory.

14:57.454 --> 14:59.754
Eric.
I-I-I can't find him.

14:59.821 --> 15:01.053
I can't find Horatio anywhere.

15:01.120 --> 15:02.554
Mari, Mari, listen, slow down.

15:02.621 --> 15:03.687
Slow down, okay?

15:03.754 --> 15:05.020
I need to get a hold of him.

15:05.087 --> 15:06.287
What happened?

15:06.354 --> 15:07.287
Somebody vandalized my car.

15:07.354 --> 15:09.020
They, um, they stole my purse.

15:09.087 --> 15:11.287
I just ran into the store
for a second.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

15:11.354 --> 15:12.721
Vandalized how?

15:12.787 --> 15:14.320
They broke my window.

15:14.387 --> 15:16.687
Do you think they're trying
to send Horatio a message?

15:16.754 --> 15:19.187
No. No, this has nothing
to do with him.

15:19.254 --> 15:20.420
It has to do with me.

15:20.487 --> 15:21.888
You?

15:21.954 --> 15:23.454
Yeah, it's personal.

15:23.521 --> 15:24.654
I'll explain later.

15:24.721 --> 15:26.888
I want you to take
your car to the shop

15:26.954 --> 15:28.988
and I'll call you
when I get your purse.

15:29.053 --> 15:30.888
Yeah. Okay.

15:30.954 --> 15:32.187
Thanks, little brother.

15:32.254 --> 15:33.721
Sorry.

15:43.087 --> 15:45.754
Gloria.
Eric.

15:45.821 --> 15:47.854
Two visits in one day.

15:47.921 --> 15:49.287
I never understood, Gloria.

15:49.354 --> 15:52.621
You got all of this,
and you still want to harass me?

15:52.687 --> 15:55.387
Money can't
buy you love.
I warned you.

15:55.454 --> 15:59.220
Guess we're both spending
the day warning people, huh?

15:59.287 --> 16:01.888
No, you're threatening people,
innocent people.

16:03.320 --> 16:05.254
Now, where is Marisol's purse?

16:05.320 --> 16:06.587
Oh.

16:06.654 --> 16:07.854
You're here for
your wife's stuff?

16:07.921 --> 16:09.954
I told you,
she's not my wife.

16:10.020 --> 16:11.220
Then I don't
have her stuff.

16:11.287 --> 16:12.587
She's my sister.

16:12.654 --> 16:13.921
All right?

16:13.988 --> 16:16.087
Look, I've seen you
and her together.

16:16.153 --> 16:17.654
She has a
wedding ring.

16:17.721 --> 16:18.854
Her last name's Delko.

16:18.921 --> 16:20.687
I can do the math.
Good.

16:20.754 --> 16:22.187
Then you can do the time.

16:22.254 --> 16:24.754
I'll let the state attorney know
to give you the max.

16:26.854 --> 16:29.854
Okay, I'll get her purse.

16:29.921 --> 16:31.420
You want to come in?

16:34.521 --> 16:36.120
Get your checkbook, too.

16:36.187 --> 16:37.954
For the window?
Yeah.

16:38.020 --> 16:39.687
For both of them.

16:47.587 --> 16:48.621
Horatio.

16:48.687 --> 16:49.954
Get the warrant, Frank?

16:50.020 --> 16:51.554
Fastest I got one
from anybody.

16:51.621 --> 16:54.153
Gunfire in a courtroom
will do that.

16:56.921 --> 16:58.587
<i>MAN ( over radio ):
Surrounding
Japanese restaurant.</i>

16:58.654 --> 17:01.420
<i>Four suspected Mala Noche gang
members believed to be inside.</i>

17:01.487 --> 17:03.721
They are heavily armed
and extremely dangerous.

17:03.787 --> 17:08.119
Repeat, they are heavily armed
and extremely dangerous.

17:08.186 --> 17:11.487
Team seven to the flank;
watch triangulation and fire.

17:11.554 --> 17:14.721
<i>OFFICER:
One... two... three.
( gunshots )</i>

17:14.787 --> 17:17.854
All clear.

17:19.020 --> 17:21.253
Restaurant's close
to the courthouse.

17:21.319 --> 17:23.820
Good place
to disappear quickly.

17:23.887 --> 17:25.253
Yes, and the cigarettes
are still burning.

17:28.687 --> 17:29.888
And there are the clothes.

17:29.954 --> 17:31.420
Someone tipped them off
we were coming.

17:31.487 --> 17:32.921
Well, it
wasn't Benito.

17:32.988 --> 17:35.020
I've had guys sitting on him
since we hooked him up.

17:35.087 --> 17:36.854
No phone calls,
no visitors.

17:36.921 --> 17:38.053
Who else knew?

17:38.120 --> 17:40.354
Only the judge
who signed the warrant.

17:40.420 --> 17:42.320
Who else?

17:42.387 --> 17:44.354
I don't know-- clerk,
state attorney?

17:44.420 --> 17:47.521
What about
the janitor, Frank?

17:49.554 --> 17:51.521
What's going on?

17:51.587 --> 17:53.621
Cops picked me up,
told me nothing.

17:53.687 --> 17:57.120
HORATIO:
That's because you're going to
do all the talking, Mr. Parker.

17:57.187 --> 17:59.187
Hey, look, why
don't we go inside

17:59.254 --> 18:01.120
or someplace else?
What's the problem?

18:01.187 --> 18:02.654
It's a beautiful day out here.

18:02.721 --> 18:05.087
And it could be your last
with the Mala Noches

18:05.153 --> 18:06.053
floating around,
Mr. Parker.

18:06.120 --> 18:07.621
We did some checking.

18:07.687 --> 18:11.988
You have no daughters, no wife,
which means no one to threaten.

18:21.087 --> 18:23.287
All right, all right,
it's true, all right?

18:23.354 --> 18:25.053
I was in it for the money.

18:25.120 --> 18:27.220
How did you tip them to us?

18:27.287 --> 18:29.621
Every day, I get cell phone
numbers from the Noches.

18:29.687 --> 18:31.153
Burners.

18:31.220 --> 18:32.954
I call them if I got a lead.

18:33.020 --> 18:35.554
I saw your
warrant issue--

18:35.621 --> 18:37.153
confirmed copies, clerk's mail.

18:37.220 --> 18:38.921
That was a hot tip?

18:38.988 --> 18:40.554
Hey, listen, guys, all right?
I don't know where

18:40.621 --> 18:41.654
they went-- I'm telling you.

18:41.721 --> 18:43.454
Frank, check his cell phone.

18:53.153 --> 18:54.921
MARISOL:
Hey.

18:56.888 --> 18:58.387
Where's your protection?

18:58.454 --> 19:01.854
No, I just told him I was
going to come see you.

19:01.921 --> 19:03.320
You got my purse back.

19:03.387 --> 19:06.254
Yeah. Look, I'm sorry
it was taken in the first place.

19:06.320 --> 19:07.454
Thank u.

19:07.521 --> 19:08.521
Is everything
still inside?

19:08.587 --> 19:10.220
Yeah, the motive
was never robbery.

19:10.287 --> 19:11.854
This girl thought
you were my wife.

19:11.921 --> 19:13.787
Your wife?

19:16.120 --> 19:18.387
She's not balanced, okay?

19:18.454 --> 19:19.888
I'm actually glad
that she didn't

19:19.954 --> 19:21.187
do something more serious.

19:21.254 --> 19:23.220
Your girlfriend.

19:27.454 --> 19:29.387
What? What's up?

19:29.454 --> 19:33.053
I thought I saw a glint
or something.

19:33.120 --> 19:34.954
Eric! Eric!

19:48.954 --> 19:50.454
Francis.
Horatio.

19:50.521 --> 19:52.153
Shots were fired;
The Delkos were hit.

19:58.020 --> 19:59.888
Mari. Mari, you're
going to be okay.

19:59.954 --> 20:01.354
Sit down here,
come on.

20:01.420 --> 20:02.721
Eric, you okay?

20:02.787 --> 20:03.821
I'm fine-- Marisol's been hit.

20:03.888 --> 20:05.120
MAN:
Lieutenant.
Talk to me.

20:05.187 --> 20:06.220
Projectile entered her abdomen.

20:06.287 --> 20:07.454
It's still in her.

20:07.521 --> 20:09.554
Okay, load her,
I'm going with her.

20:09.621 --> 20:11.320
All right, load her.
Sweetheart, here we go.

20:11.387 --> 20:12.821
I'm here.

20:12.888 --> 20:14.354
We're going to go
for a little ride.

20:14.420 --> 20:15.420
Load her! Let's go!

20:26.254 --> 20:28.487
Don't ever leave me.

20:28.554 --> 20:29.687
Never.

20:42.888 --> 20:44.287
What happened?

20:44.354 --> 20:45.787
A car's blocking the way.

20:45.854 --> 20:47.120
They're not moving--
I don't understand.

20:49.721 --> 20:50.821
They're here for me.

20:52.053 --> 20:53.187
I'm getting out.

21:03.053 --> 21:03.954
Whoa, whoa, hold on!

21:04.020 --> 21:04.888
I got you.

21:11.187 --> 21:13.020
Radio the E.R.

21:13.087 --> 21:14.621
Inbound G.S.W. is diving.

21:14.687 --> 21:16.320
We have uncontrollable
abdominal bleeding.

21:35.287 --> 21:37.354
Stay down.

21:37.420 --> 21:38.888
Stay down.

21:48.587 --> 21:50.787
<i>( mouthing )
I'm trying to get this
back into you.'</i>

21:50.854 --> 21:52.120
I can't find a vein!

21:52.187 --> 21:54.954
Inserting subclavian line.

22:19.008 --> 22:20.874
Lieutenant.

22:20.941 --> 22:22.340
What do you think?

22:22.407 --> 22:24.173
We were able
to extract the bullet.

22:24.240 --> 22:26.641
It entered her kidney and
then penetrated her spleen,

22:26.707 --> 22:28.741
but we lost
precious time with her.

22:28.807 --> 22:31.140
Okay.
In some way,
I'm sorry to say,

22:31.207 --> 22:33.140
that car was
more dangerous
than the bullet.

22:33.207 --> 22:34.707
What about her chances?

22:34.774 --> 22:36.440
<i>Well, she's stable right now.
( door opens )</i>

22:36.507 --> 22:38.140
I'll call you if
her condition changes.

22:38.207 --> 22:39.807
Thank you, doctor.

22:45.574 --> 22:48.273
I can't believe this, H.

22:50.874 --> 22:53.440
Did you call
your parents yet?

22:53.507 --> 22:56.641
Yeah. They're on the way.

22:56.707 --> 22:57.674
Okay.

22:57.741 --> 22:59.074
Eric...

23:02.674 --> 23:04.941
You get the shooter,
I'll get the driver.

23:25.574 --> 23:28.741
You fight, Mari, okay?

23:28.807 --> 23:31.273
You fight.

23:41.907 --> 23:44.340
<i>REPORTER:
Three members of
the Mala Noche gang</i>

23:44.407 --> 23:46.307

23:46.374 --> 23:49.707
<i>One is still at large,

23:51.407 --> 23:52.874
WOODS:
The city's going crazy today.

23:52.941 --> 23:54.474
Shooting up a courtroom,

23:54.540 --> 23:56.674
trying to kill Horatio
in broad daylight?

23:56.741 --> 23:57.941
Eric and Marisol!

23:58.008 --> 23:59.273
Most dangerous
kind of criminal

23:59.340 --> 24:01.507
is the one
that doesn't care.

24:01.574 --> 24:04.041
Well, at least they're down
two for two.

24:04.108 --> 24:05.173
Yeah, drop
in the bucket.

24:06.140 --> 24:07.774
How is she,
Horatio?

24:07.841 --> 24:09.974
She's in good hands, Alexx,
but thank you for asking.

24:10.041 --> 24:11.707
If there's anything I can do.

24:11.774 --> 24:13.008
I appreciate it.

24:22.474 --> 24:24.074
Mr. Wolfe, what is that?

24:30.407 --> 24:32.807
It's a contact lens.

24:32.874 --> 24:35.440
The force of the skid
must have knocked it out.

24:35.507 --> 24:37.440
Maybe that's why
he didn't shoot at you--

24:37.507 --> 24:38.474
couldn't see you.

24:47.841 --> 24:49.774
Either way, this will have
plenty of DNA

24:49.841 --> 24:50.941
from his tear ducts.

24:51.008 --> 24:52.074
Let's get it to the lab.

24:52.140 --> 24:53.741
I'll do it right away.

24:59.240 --> 25:00.474
How's your sister?

25:00.540 --> 25:02.273
My parents are
with her right now.

25:02.340 --> 25:05.041
I just figured I could do
more for her out here,

25:05.108 --> 25:06.173
helping to find her shooter.

25:06.240 --> 25:08.407
All right.

25:08.474 --> 25:11.440
Well, let's get to work
and see what we find.

25:11.507 --> 25:13.540
It's most likely
a Mala Noche shooter,

25:13.607 --> 25:15.374
but we have to follow
the evidence.

25:15.440 --> 25:17.041
We believe that the shots came

25:17.108 --> 25:18.340
from across the street.

25:18.407 --> 25:20.307
We found the bullet
that grazed your arm

25:20.374 --> 25:21.540
embedded in the post.

25:21.607 --> 25:22.907
Why, what's up?

25:22.974 --> 25:26.074
Nothing, I thought saw
a glint or something.

25:34.041 --> 25:35.641
Bullet traveled at
a downward trajectory.

25:35.707 --> 25:38.074
What caliber round
was the shooter using?

25:38.140 --> 25:40.641
A .308.
It's a sniper caliber,

25:40.707 --> 25:44.273
which expands our
search area considerably...

25:44.340 --> 25:45.574
into Noche territory.

25:45.641 --> 25:47.440
Judging by the depth and
the angle of the bullet,

25:47.507 --> 25:49.474
I believe that
the shots were fired

25:49.540 --> 25:50.674
from an elevated platform.

25:54.008 --> 25:55.340
The bullet
came from that building.

25:55.407 --> 25:57.108
I saw a glint

25:57.173 --> 25:58.440
right before the shots rang out.

25:58.507 --> 26:00.774
We have to extrapolate
from the variables.

26:00.841 --> 26:02.574
Depending on the distance,

26:02.641 --> 26:05.540
there are several
different trajectories.

26:17.841 --> 26:19.874
Well, if this is
where your shooter was,

26:19.941 --> 26:23.008
they never expected us
to find this spot.

26:23.074 --> 26:25.641
Well, let's hope
there's more to find.

26:30.807 --> 26:32.841
Oh, I've got something.

26:35.874 --> 26:37.041
It's a woman's fingernail.

26:37.108 --> 26:38.474
Is there any chance

26:38.540 --> 26:40.340
the Noches are using
female assassins?

26:42.173 --> 26:43.741
No.

26:45.240 --> 26:47.008
Those are Gloria's.

26:47.074 --> 26:48.807
I saw them
on her today.

26:48.874 --> 26:50.374
I'm going to find her.

26:50.440 --> 26:52.074
Eric?

26:52.140 --> 26:55.674
If you find her... follow
procedure, don't make it worse.

26:57.440 --> 27:00.407
Valera. Status on
the contact lens?

27:00.474 --> 27:02.173
You were right,
it was brimming with DNA.

27:02.240 --> 27:04.074
Who'd we get?
Your guy with
the bad vision?

27:04.140 --> 27:06.173
"Memmo Fierro."

27:06.240 --> 27:07.173
That's the driver.

27:07.240 --> 27:09.041
The guy who
cut you off.

27:09.108 --> 27:11.407
Problem is, there's
no last known address.

27:11.474 --> 27:12.741
We don't need it,
we've got his car.

27:12.807 --> 27:14.108
Thank you.

27:43.273 --> 27:45.140
I ran a brand check
on those cigarettes

27:45.207 --> 27:46.607
we got in the car ashtray.

27:46.674 --> 27:47.874
They're Venenos.

27:47.941 --> 27:49.041
Salvadoran.

27:49.108 --> 27:51.273
These are
Panamanian,

27:51.340 --> 27:52.941
and these
are Bolivian.

27:53.008 --> 27:55.507
And this car's registered
in New York.

27:55.574 --> 27:57.374
So it looks like everyone's
headed to Miami,

27:57.440 --> 27:58.841
and I'm guessing
not for vacation.

27:58.907 --> 28:01.774
Not for a vacation,
for a Universal, Mr. Wolfe.

28:01.841 --> 28:04.374
Meeting of all the Noche heads.

28:04.440 --> 28:06.607
It's why they broke
Sifuentes out.

28:06.674 --> 28:09.273
He must be a really big
deal in the Noches.

28:11.774 --> 28:13.674
What is this?

28:14.841 --> 28:15.974
On the front tire rim?

28:17.641 --> 28:18.707
It's blood.

28:18.774 --> 28:20.574
I'll have DNA
confirm it.

28:20.641 --> 28:23.041
No, nobody was shot
up there.

28:32.774 --> 28:34.074
So what is it?

28:34.140 --> 28:35.607
I don't know, get it to trace.

28:49.407 --> 28:51.307
Get out of the car.

28:51.374 --> 28:52.774
Get the hell
out of the car!

28:52.841 --> 28:54.074
What are you doing here?

28:54.140 --> 28:56.008
Wh you mean is,
you thought you got me

28:56.074 --> 28:58.140
with that shot, right?
Tried to kill my sister, too!

28:58.207 --> 28:59.607
Now open the trunk!

28:59.674 --> 29:01.407
I didn't shoot her.

29:01.474 --> 29:02.440
Open the trunk!

29:07.874 --> 29:09.374
If you didn't shoot her,
then what's this?

29:09.440 --> 29:10.841
That isn't mine.

29:10.907 --> 29:12.108
You're going to tell me
you don't remember

29:12.173 --> 29:14.108
showing me that
on our first date?

29:14.173 --> 29:16.173
And you used it
this afternoon?!

29:16.240 --> 29:18.440
Hey. You... you have
no proof of that.

29:18.507 --> 29:19.540
No, but I will.

29:19.607 --> 29:20.807
You know what?

29:20.874 --> 29:22.540
I am beginning to remember
why we broke up!

29:22.607 --> 29:24.074
I never forgot!

29:31.974 --> 29:33.173
You were right,
the red substance

29:33.240 --> 29:34.407
you found
on the wheel rim,

29:34.474 --> 29:35.607
wasn't biological.

29:35.674 --> 29:37.374
So I ran it
through the mass spec.

29:37.440 --> 29:39.173
It's dye.

29:39.240 --> 29:40.641
The city runs select tests
to ensure

29:40.707 --> 29:42.574
that parasites
and other foreign substances

29:42.641 --> 29:43.907
aren't transported
through our water system.

29:43.974 --> 29:45.907
They use it to check
flow patterns.

29:53.140 --> 29:54.907
So that's what this is.

29:54.974 --> 29:56.741
Came from
the sprinkler system.

29:56.807 --> 29:59.407
So I called the WASD,
and they told me

29:59.474 --> 30:00.674
only one part of
the county

30:00.741 --> 30:02.374
is currently
being tested.

30:02.440 --> 30:03.907
Star Island.

30:03.974 --> 30:05.307
That narrows it down,
doesn't it?

30:05.374 --> 30:06.540
Figured if there's a Universal,

30:06.607 --> 30:08.008
there's gonna be
a lot of cars there.

30:08.074 --> 30:10.240
And a lot of heat
from those cars.

30:10.307 --> 30:12.907
They'll use a house as
a base of operations.

30:12.974 --> 30:16.207
Be holed up there
probably 24-36 hours.

30:16.273 --> 30:17.874
So I had the
satellite search

30:17.941 --> 30:19.540
for multiple
heat sources.

30:22.607 --> 30:23.540
Bingo.

30:23.607 --> 30:25.641
"351 Star Island."

31:35.574 --> 31:36.574
Don't move!
Don't move!

31:39.008 --> 31:40.507
OFFICER:
Do it now!
Hands behind your head!

31:40.574 --> 31:42.674
Hands behind
your head!

32:11.374 --> 32:13.474
The party's over, Raphael.

32:30.204 --> 32:32.370
You guys are pretty good.

32:32.437 --> 32:34.871
The same can't be said
about you, my friend.

32:34.938 --> 32:36.404
TRIPP:
Bad idea, Sifuentes.

32:36.471 --> 32:39.504
Having that Universal
the same day you bust out.

32:39.571 --> 32:42.504
Well, you know,
time ain't cheap.

32:42.571 --> 32:44.204
Neither is life.

32:44.270 --> 32:46.404
TRIPP:
As we speak, sweeps are
happening nationwide.

32:46.471 --> 32:48.437
Noche's are
going down.

32:48.504 --> 32:49.737
They can thank
you for that.

32:51.771 --> 32:53.237
What you still
talking to me for?

32:53.304 --> 32:55.237
I want Memmo Fierro.

32:55.304 --> 32:57.270
Memmo?

32:57.337 --> 32:58.571
He's down in Mexico.

32:58.637 --> 33:00.537
That's not true, is it, Raphael?

33:00.604 --> 33:02.871
He ran an ambulance
off the road,

33:02.938 --> 33:05.170
and my wife may die
because of it.

33:05.237 --> 33:06.404
Then why ask?

33:06.471 --> 33:08.838
Because you know where he .

33:08.904 --> 33:10.103
You tell us,
you can help yourself.

33:10.170 --> 33:12.404
Got nothing on us.

33:12.471 --> 33:15.337
On the contrary, Raphael,
I've got your safe house.

33:15.404 --> 33:16.370
Frank.

33:16.437 --> 33:18.070
Officer Jessop's already on it.

33:18.137 --> 33:20.571
We're going to find
your compadre.

33:23.604 --> 33:24.970
Calleigh, you have anything?

33:25.037 --> 33:28.170
Yeah. I just finished my
test fire of Gloria's rifle.

33:28.237 --> 33:29.304
And?

33:29.370 --> 33:30.604
And I was about
to compare it

33:30.671 --> 33:32.537
to the bullet that we got
from the wall.

33:32.604 --> 33:35.204
But I can tell you
that typical magazine

33:35.270 --> 33:37.571
to bolt action .308
holds five rounds.

33:37.637 --> 33:39.704
I emptied this one,
and I got three.

33:39.771 --> 33:41.037
Which is consistent

33:41.103 --> 33:42.571
with two shots
being fired at you and Marisol.

33:45.604 --> 33:48.838
I never thought that it would go
from breaking windows to this.

33:55.170 --> 33:56.170
Wait a minute.

33:59.103 --> 34:00.237
I don't think she did.

34:00.304 --> 34:01.737
Why?

34:01.804 --> 34:03.504
The striations don't match.

34:03.571 --> 34:05.370
This isn't your gun,
Gloria isn't your shooter.

34:07.103 --> 34:09.103
I told you it wasn't me.

34:09.170 --> 34:12.103
My sister's in the
hospital, okay?

34:12.170 --> 34:14.270
And whoever shot her
is still out there.

34:14.337 --> 34:16.170
I know you were
there, okay?

34:16.237 --> 34:17.704
We found your fingernail
at the scene.

34:17.771 --> 34:19.737
Now, tell me what
the hell you saw.

34:19.804 --> 34:22.603
Look, I followed you
from my house.

34:22.670 --> 34:25.771
I was all set up.

34:25.838 --> 34:28.637
I had Marisol
in my sights, and I...

34:28.704 --> 34:30.237
Look, my mind was
just screaming...

34:32.603 --> 34:36.304
.but I couldn't
pull the trigger.

34:36.370 --> 34:41.070
And then I heard a shot.

34:41.137 --> 34:43.504
I couldn't believe that that's
what I was thinking of doing.

34:45.871 --> 34:48.838
Eric, I'm so sorry.

34:48.904 --> 34:52.204
Stop being sorry, okay,
and start being helpful.

34:53.704 --> 34:55.471
Where did the shot come from?

35:03.304 --> 35:05.170
Where did the shot come from?

35:05.237 --> 35:08.304
From the right, above me.

35:08.370 --> 35:09.604
Did it echo?

35:09.671 --> 35:10.871
Yes.

35:10.938 --> 35:12.504
Okay, then it came
from a covered balcony.

35:12.571 --> 35:15.103
Does that help?

35:15.170 --> 35:17.504
You better hope so.

35:53.404 --> 35:54.904
Officer Jessop.

35:54.970 --> 35:56.904
That Mala Noche safe house
was a gold mine.

35:56.970 --> 35:58.003
Found a ton of money

35:58.070 --> 35:59.304
and an arsenal in there, sir.

35:59.370 --> 36:01.137
Yes, and a .308, I see.

36:01.204 --> 36:02.370
Get it to
Firearms, please.

36:02.437 --> 36:03.437
Yes, sir.

36:05.471 --> 36:07.838
So it was the Noches
that shot Mari, huh?

36:07.904 --> 36:09.070
Certainly looks
that way, Eric.

36:09.137 --> 36:10.838
We got to get
them for this.

36:10.904 --> 36:13.737
We're going to get them.

36:16.771 --> 36:18.070
Delko.

36:18.137 --> 36:20.871
Yes, Doctor.

36:20.938 --> 36:23.170
I'll tell him.

36:23.237 --> 36:24.871
Is that the hospital?

36:24.938 --> 36:26.838
Yeah.

36:26.904 --> 36:27.838
She's asking for you.

36:27.904 --> 36:29.504
I'm on my way.

36:29.571 --> 36:31.170
I'm gonna run with this.

36:31.237 --> 36:33.604
Calleigh thinks she found
where the shooter really was.

36:33.671 --> 36:35.737
Eric, wait for me.

37:13.604 --> 37:16.804
Don't be sad.

37:18.804 --> 37:22.671
I have dinner plans tonight.

37:24.704 --> 37:25.637
Casa Tua?

37:25.704 --> 37:27.404
Casa Tua.
8:30?

37:27.471 --> 37:29.170
8:30.

37:29.237 --> 37:31.471
Did you get the good table?

37:31.537 --> 37:32.804
Got the good table.

37:39.204 --> 37:41.838
You, um...

37:41.904 --> 37:45.370
You're not planning to...

37:45.437 --> 37:49.337
You're not planning
to stand me up, are you?

37:53.003 --> 37:55.337
Never.

38:56.637 --> 38:58.704
Should have accounted for the
slight variance in trajectory

38:58.771 --> 39:00.437
when the bullet
grazed your arm.

39:00.504 --> 39:01.671
We were off
by six degrees.

39:01.737 --> 39:03.871
We were looking
on the wrong floor.

39:03.938 --> 39:04.871
There it is.

39:04.938 --> 39:07.103
What?

39:07.170 --> 39:08.103
GSR cone.

39:08.170 --> 39:09.370
When a gun like this

39:09.437 --> 39:11.137
is fired,
the escaping gasses settle.

39:19.370 --> 39:21.737
So Memmo was
definitely here.

39:24.970 --> 39:27.204
Well, they took their gun
back to the safe house,

39:27.270 --> 39:28.571
but not everything.

39:29.604 --> 39:31.304
What is it?

39:31.370 --> 39:33.737
<i>Lo mas dulce
de la cana.</i>

39:33.804 --> 39:37.237
It's two boutique-sized
bottles of Yarmy rum.

39:37.304 --> 39:39.404
Memmo must have tried
to calm his nerves.

39:39.471 --> 39:42.370
Only one hotel in Miami
that uses these as a guest perk.

39:42.437 --> 39:43.604
That's the Marano.

39:43.671 --> 39:45.304
That must be where
he's staying.

39:45.370 --> 39:47.270
I imagine that you and Horatio

39:47.337 --> 39:48.938
are gonna want
to take it from here.

39:49.003 --> 39:51.003
Yeah.

40:00.003 --> 40:01.003
H.

40:10.970 --> 40:12.804
Okay.

40:14.838 --> 40:18.871
I am so sorry.

41:19.137 --> 41:20.370
We got Memmo Fierro.

41:20.437 --> 41:21.671
Mm.

41:21.737 --> 41:23.871
Tripp picked him up
at the Marano Hotel,

41:23.938 --> 41:25.637
just like we thought.

41:25.704 --> 41:26.704
Let's go.

41:28.804 --> 41:30.871
<i>FIERRO:
Hey, let me out of here!</i>

41:47.103 --> 41:48.270
<i>FIERRO ( muffled ):
Hey, let me out!</i>

41:48.337 --> 41:49.404
Let me out of here!

41:49.471 --> 41:50.604
Hey, I confessed already!

41:50.671 --> 41:51.871
CAINE:
Come on, let's go.

41:54.037 --> 41:57.270
Memmo, in the unlikely event

41:57.337 --> 42:00.804
that I haven't
made myself clear,

42:00.871 --> 42:04.737
you deserve to know
that this is your last chance.

42:04.804 --> 42:05.871
Hey, I already
confessed.

42:05.938 --> 42:08.103
I shot her.

42:14.137 --> 42:17.304
Who put the hit on my sister?

42:17.370 --> 42:19.671
Who gave the order?

42:26.170 --> 42:28.504
Riaz. Antonio Riaz.

42:28.571 --> 42:31.103
The snitch that was
on the stand today?

42:32.737 --> 42:34.304
<i>Si.</i>

42:34.370 --> 42:35.938
He wanted you to know...

42:37.804 --> 42:40.970
...it's his city now.

42:41.037 --> 42:45.437
Memmo, now that you work for me,
here's what I want you to do.

42:45.504 --> 42:49.571
I want you to tell Mr. Riaz
that I said he's a dead man.
