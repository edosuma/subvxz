right here yells "Go"

12:30.283 --> 12:33.051
then Babe chickened out.

12:33.053 --> 12:37.388

Breaking some speed record,

13:58.138 --> 13:58.937
or supporting me

13:58.939 --> 14:01.005

- Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Y'know what...

14:07.681 --> 14:09.647
I think I just
thought of an idea

14:09.649 --> 14:11.449
of how we can
break this record!

14:11.451 --> 14:12.417
- What?! How?! Tell me!

14:12.419 --> 14:13.685
- All right...

14:13.687 --> 14:15.320
this might be
a little dangerous...

14:15.322 --> 14:18.189
but what if
we combine our weight

14:18.191 --> 14:20.458
and go down together?

14:20.460 --> 14:25.930
- Dad, you've endangered
my life a thousand times...

14:32.973 --> 14:35.640
You guys can only go down
the slide one at a time!

14:35.642 --> 14:37.008
- What's that in your hand?

14:37.010 --> 14:41.112
- It's my rock!
And don't make me use it!

14:41.114 --> 14:43.181
- Sir, why not
let them go together?

14:43.183 --> 14:44.482
- 'Cuz it's against the rules!

14:44.484 --> 14:46.985
And if I let them do it
I could lose my job!

14:46.987 --> 14:50.121

to close down forever
