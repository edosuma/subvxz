00:41.433 --> 00:42.601
- <i>Hello.</i>
- Good morning.

00:42.635 --> 00:44.904
My name is Martha Plant,
and I'm calling to see

00:44.937 --> 00:47.339
if you're interested in staying
extra cool this summer.

01:27.714 --> 01:29.281
<i>If it were
the apocalypse</i>

01:29.314 --> 01:31.818
<i>and I could only save
one thing,</i>

01:31.851 --> 01:33.585
<i>I'd save my shovel.</i>

01:33.618 --> 01:36.089
<i>I could fend off unwanted
visitors and still keep</i>

01:36.122 --> 01:37.422
<i>my planting business.</i>

01:51.536 --> 01:53.305
<i>Not my favorite president,</i>

01:55.074 --> 01:56.008
<i>but I'll take it.</i>

02:07.285 --> 02:08.688
<i>What the hell?</i>

02:24.137 --> 02:25.772
It's been a little complicated,

02:25.805 --> 02:27.039
you know, since I left.

02:28.573 --> 02:30.475
Oh, Carl thought
I was going to hell.

02:31.010 --> 02:32.544
Carl is a virgin.

02:32.577 --> 02:34.213
I've been having
sexual intercourse

02:34.247 --> 02:36.515
since I was 12-years-old.

02:36.548 --> 02:39.351
He decided,
probably my soul wasn't safe,

02:40.552 --> 02:41.620
called off the wedding.

02:42.387 --> 02:44.690
So, I'm just here...

02:45.024 --> 02:46.759
Just...

02:46.793 --> 02:48.995
trying to make right
with Jesus, you know?

02:51.731 --> 02:53.733
I'm not really into that
kinda stuff.

02:59.172 --> 03:01.808
I used to make Carl peanut
butter and jelly sandwiches.

03:03.075 --> 03:06.646
I'd put them in paper bags
and drop them by his work.

03:06.679 --> 03:09.514
He was the assistant pastor's
assistant in our church.

03:14.253 --> 03:15.620
Are those your grandparents?

03:17.355 --> 03:18.456
They're my parents.

03:19.357 --> 03:20.760
You have your mom's cheeks.

03:21.160 --> 03:22.494
I'm adopted.

03:22.527 --> 03:24.864
- Oh.
- I was left in a trash can.

03:30.636 --> 03:32.305
Maybe God brought you
to the people

03:32.337 --> 03:33.873
you were supposed to be with.

03:46.886 --> 03:51.023
<i>Mom and dad, in honor of
your one year death anniversary,</i>

03:51.057 --> 03:52.658
<i>I had my first lunch guest.</i>

03:53.793 --> 03:55.761
<i>It was different
than with the three of us.</i>

03:57.129 --> 03:58.530
<i>She's very weird.</i>

04:09.541 --> 04:11.409
<i>Bridges Hospital
Mental health center,</i>

04:11.443 --> 04:12.678
<i>how may I direct your call?</i>

04:12.712 --> 04:14.814
Hi, I'm calling
about one of your patients,

04:15.281 --> 04:16.983
Sadie Mayflower.

04:17.016 --> 04:19.785
She's sleeping on the street
with a helmet locked to her head.

04:19.819 --> 04:22.221
<i>Oh, yeah, we've been
releasing our patients.</i>

04:22.255 --> 04:23.622
Why?

04:23.656 --> 04:25.825
<i>We're closing
our doors due to bankruptcy,</i>

04:25.858 --> 04:28.393
<i>and five counts
of embezzlement.</i>

04:28.728 --> 04:29.996
Okay.

04:30.029 --> 04:32.865
So, they're just out there,

04:32.899 --> 04:34.466
running free?

04:34.499 --> 04:36.969
<i>All the non-violent ones.</i>

05:07.166 --> 05:10.703
You know... I know we haven't
known each other for much time

05:10.736 --> 05:12.470
and I'm just a caretaker,

05:13.105 --> 05:14.340
but I like our talks.

05:14.373 --> 05:15.440
Me too.

05:19.045 --> 05:20.313
Oh, hi, Martha.

05:20.346 --> 05:21.513
This is my friend Jesus.

05:21.546 --> 05:22.748
I know who he is.

05:22.782 --> 05:23.683
Hi, Martha.

05:24.516 --> 05:25.651
It's been a while.

05:26.484 --> 05:27.452
Let's go, Sadie.

05:27.485 --> 05:28.520
Well, where are we going?

05:28.553 --> 05:29.621
You can stay with me.

05:29.655 --> 05:32.258
Oh, you need a place
to stay, Sadie?

05:32.291 --> 05:33.491
You can stay here at the church.

05:33.525 --> 05:35.428
No, I think you'd
be more comfortable with me,

05:35.460 --> 05:37.363
We have a couple of rooms
in the back.

05:37.396 --> 05:38.463
Nice blow-up beds.

05:38.496 --> 05:39.865
I can blow up a bed for you.

05:43.936 --> 05:44.804
Okay.

05:46.172 --> 05:48.941
Well, if it doesn't work out,

05:49.809 --> 05:52.078
you're always welcome
in God's house.

06:01.921 --> 06:04.223
Do you have any family
or friends in law enforcement?

06:04.256 --> 06:05.590
No.

06:05.623 --> 06:07.259
Any friends
you confide regularly in?

06:08.794 --> 06:09.662
No.

06:10.730 --> 06:12.098
Okay.

06:12.131 --> 06:13.966
Whatever happens out here,

06:14.000 --> 06:16.268
is between you and me.

06:16.302 --> 06:17.403
No one else can know.

06:17.436 --> 06:19.772
And nobody can know who I am.

06:19.805 --> 06:21.506
I've been running this
business anonymously

06:21.539 --> 06:23.476
and without any problems
since I was 11,

06:23.508 --> 06:25.111
and I want to keep it that way.

06:25.478 --> 06:26.544
Got it?

06:28.848 --> 06:29.849
Good.

06:29.882 --> 06:31.017
Depending on how this goes,

06:31.050 --> 06:33.853
I may be open
to discussing profit splits.

06:39.825 --> 06:42.128
<i>I have always believed
I'd find the perfect assistant.</i>

06:42.161 --> 06:44.630
<i>Someone who would really
understand what I do.</i>

06:45.931 --> 06:47.532
<i>I bury treasure
for the lucky person</i>

06:47.565 --> 06:48.968
<i>who gets to it first.</i>

06:50.503 --> 06:52.371
<i>Every time, without a doubt,</i>

06:52.405 --> 06:54.040
<i>they compensate me in cash.</i>

06:55.641 --> 06:56.842
<i>We never meet,</i>

06:57.643 --> 06:58.911
<i>but we both win.</i>

06:59.979 --> 07:01.247
<i>It's the highlight of my day.</i>

07:38.184 --> 07:40.753
God, thank you for today.

07:40.786 --> 07:42.655
Thank you, for Martha Plant.

07:42.688 --> 07:44.290
For her generosity,

07:44.323 --> 07:45.524
for our new friendship,

07:45.558 --> 07:47.326
in your name, Amen.

07:54.967 --> 07:56.936
Your water pressure
is very powerful.

07:57.903 --> 07:59.939
I think you get cleaner
that way.

07:59.972 --> 08:01.674
My mother
made me take a lot of showers.

08:02.775 --> 08:04.510
We used to be just cold.

08:04.543 --> 08:05.911
That's why
she had me take so many.

08:07.480 --> 08:08.948
Did someone teach you
how to plant?

08:10.349 --> 08:11.250
No.

08:12.017 --> 08:12.885
I like it.

08:13.786 --> 08:15.054
Makes you feel like your worries

08:15.087 --> 08:16.655
kinda roll off.

08:16.689 --> 08:18.991
Because you remember
how little you are.

08:19.024 --> 08:20.759
And how easy
it would be to just

08:21.460 --> 08:22.361
pass away.

08:28.400 --> 08:29.502
I have another job.

08:29.535 --> 08:30.970
I work from home.

08:31.003 --> 08:32.805
So, if you want to be in the
house while I'm doing that,

08:32.838 --> 08:34.507
it needs to be like
you have a speech disorder,

08:34.540 --> 08:35.841
where you're unable to speak.

08:36.308 --> 08:37.209
Okay.

08:37.243 --> 08:38.410
What's the job?

08:38.444 --> 08:39.879
I sell air-conditioning units.

08:39.912 --> 08:41.013
That sounds like fun.

08:41.447 --> 08:42.848
It's not.

08:42.882 --> 08:44.183
Oh.

08:45.951 --> 08:48.120
- Good night.
- Good night, Martha.

09:46.912 --> 09:48.781
<i>Hello.</i>

09:48.814 --> 09:50.449
Good morning,
my name is Martha Plant.

09:50.482 --> 09:53.152
I'm calling to see if you're interested...

09:53.185 --> 09:54.720
...a <i>nd my brother</i>
<i>just died,</i>

09:54.753 --> 09:58.090
<i>my husband has cancer,
my son can't stop pissing the bed...</i>

09:58.123 --> 10:00.593
Does this mean you don't want
to buy an air-conditioning unit?

10:01.727 --> 10:03.195
<i>Can you
do me a favor, Martha?</i>

10:03.229 --> 10:04.530
Yeah?

10:04.563 --> 10:06.332
<i>Throw yourself off a cliff!</i>

10:22.081 --> 10:25.685
- Hello?
- <i>Martha. Donald.</i>

10:25.719 --> 10:27.152
- Hi.
- <i>Oh.</i>

10:27.186 --> 10:31.190
<i>How I miss that
pleasant voice of yours.</i>

10:31.223 --> 10:33.826
<i>Do you have an inkling of
why I'm calling?</i>

10:33.859 --> 10:35.261
You need me to do better.

10:37.062 --> 10:39.331
<i>Gonna need you
to do more than that.</i>

10:39.365 --> 10:40.399
Okay.

10:40.432 --> 10:43.335
<i>It's not okay.
You're just so bad.</i>

10:43.369 --> 10:46.238
<i>I know, I promised your parents
I'd keep you on the roster</i>

10:46.272 --> 10:47.840
<i>when I bought the company
from them,</i>

10:47.873 --> 10:51.176
<i>but I can't do charity
work anymore.</i>

10:51.210 --> 10:54.079
<i>Now, I had you on salary
for two years.</i>

10:54.113 --> 10:56.849
<i>Now, do you know how many
units you've sold in that time?</i>

10:56.882 --> 10:57.950
- Five.
- <i>Four.</i>

10:57.983 --> 11:00.654
<i>You sold four units.</i>

11:00.687 --> 11:02.454
What do you want, Donald?

11:02.488 --> 11:04.957
<i>If you don't sell 30 air-conditioning
units in the next two weeks,</i>

11:04.990 --> 11:06.125
<i>you're fired.</i>

11:06.525 --> 11:07.393
What?

11:09.629 --> 11:12.598
<i>Mom, I know you
wanted me to have this job,</i>

11:12.632 --> 11:15.534
<i>but I told you, I'm not good
at this kinda stuff.</i>

11:16.302 --> 11:17.569
<i>Crap.</i>

11:22.709 --> 11:23.777
<i>What a tool.</i>

11:23.809 --> 11:25.511
<i>Trying to fire me...</i>

11:25.544 --> 11:27.279
<i>in front of my assistant.</i>

11:27.313 --> 11:28.414
<i>How embarrassing.</i>

11:32.217 --> 11:32.951
<i>Eureka.</i>

12:12.224 --> 12:13.559
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Good evening.

12:13.592 --> 12:15.461
My name is Martha Plant.

12:15.494 --> 12:17.229
I was calling to see
if you were interested

12:17.262 --> 12:18.864
in staying extra cool
this summer.

12:18.897 --> 12:20.532
<i>No.</i>

12:20.566 --> 12:21.934
Good evening.

12:21.967 --> 12:23.035
My name is Martha Plant.

12:23.068 --> 12:24.671
<i>Wait, who is this?</i>

12:24.704 --> 12:26.372
Martha Plant.

12:26.405 --> 12:28.006
I'm calling to see
if you were interested

12:28.040 --> 12:29.475
in staying extra cool
this summer.

12:29.508 --> 12:31.543
<i>Oh,
is this a sales call?</i>

12:31.577 --> 12:32.911
Yes.

12:32.945 --> 12:34.179
My mother's father's sister,

12:34.213 --> 12:35.981
Thelma, died of heat exhaustion.

12:36.482 --> 12:38.050
The heat is real.

12:38.083 --> 12:40.787
<i>I'm so sorry to hear that.</i>

12:40.820 --> 12:42.921
Thank you. That means so much.

12:45.290 --> 12:46.693
So...

12:46.726 --> 12:48.728
I make these calls because

12:48.762 --> 12:50.562
I want to make my imprint,
you know,

12:50.596 --> 12:51.865
however small,

12:51.897 --> 12:53.899
if I could prevent
a single premature death,

12:53.932 --> 12:56.001
I'll die happier knowing I did.

12:56.034 --> 12:57.737
You know,
I didn't catch your name.

12:57.771 --> 12:58.971
What can I call you?

12:59.004 --> 12:59.938
<i>I'm Judy.</i>

12:59.972 --> 13:00.874
<i>Judy Fine.</i>

13:00.906 --> 13:02.608
- Hi, Judy.
- <i>Hi.</i>

13:02.642 --> 13:04.543
Why, I'm so happy
to meet you.

13:04.576 --> 13:06.311
Do you know anyone
who's dies from the heat?

13:06.345 --> 13:08.580
<i>My neighbor died
of heat stroke.</i>

13:08.614 --> 13:09.649
Like I said,

13:09.682 --> 13:11.049
the heat is real.

13:11.083 --> 13:13.720
You'd think our bodies could
withhold a lot more but...

13:13.753 --> 13:15.621
We're so fragile and sacred.

13:15.655 --> 13:17.356
<i>Ain't that the truth.</i>

13:17.389 --> 13:19.958
Judy, do you have
an air-conditioner?

13:31.069 --> 13:33.472
Your parents
were really, really old

13:33.505 --> 13:34.741
when they adopted you.

13:36.608 --> 13:38.076
Yeah.

13:38.812 --> 13:40.045
They're dead now.

13:40.512 --> 13:42.481
Oh, I'm so sorry.

13:44.149 --> 13:45.384
Everybody's dead.

13:46.786 --> 13:47.720
My grandfather was shot

13:47.754 --> 13:49.121
in the head before I was born.

13:49.621 --> 13:50.522
Oh.

13:50.556 --> 13:51.825
That's so horrible.

13:51.858 --> 13:53.125
Who killed him?

13:54.293 --> 13:55.628
I don't want to talk about it.

13:56.696 --> 13:57.630
Okay.

14:18.918 --> 14:21.186
You can't really
get to know a girl, speed dating.

14:21.220 --> 14:22.822
- Oh.
- You need at least an hour,

14:22.856 --> 14:24.958
- face to face, to find out who she really is.
- Whoa.

14:24.990 --> 14:25.991
- You see?
- I see.

14:26.024 --> 14:27.292
- And today, you and her...
- Jesus...

14:46.144 --> 14:47.881
Why do you keep
locking this to your head?

14:47.914 --> 14:49.114
Ask Angie.

14:49.147 --> 14:51.250
- Who's Angie?
- My friend.

14:51.283 --> 14:52.852
Is everything all right, Sadie?

14:52.886 --> 14:54.019
Who's Sadie?

14:54.052 --> 14:55.822
- What?
- Who's Sadie?

14:55.855 --> 14:56.823
You're Sadie.

14:56.856 --> 14:57.857
I'm Emma.

14:57.891 --> 15:00.058
- Who's Emma?
- I'm Emma.

15:00.092 --> 15:02.127
- Where's Sadie?
- Who's Sadie?

15:02.160 --> 15:03.730
- You're Sadie.
- I'm Emma.

15:03.763 --> 15:04.664
Who are you?

15:12.705 --> 15:13.873
<i>Hello?</i>

15:13.907 --> 15:15.240
Good morning,
my name is Martha Plant.

15:15.274 --> 15:17.442
- How...
- Oh, what kind of plant are you?

15:17.476 --> 15:19.344
- <i>Excuse me?</i>
- I apologize.

15:19.378 --> 15:20.212
What?

15:20.245 --> 15:21.446
You have to stop talking.

15:21.480 --> 15:22.180
Why?

15:22.214 --> 15:23.115
Because I'm working.

15:23.148 --> 15:24.550
But you're on the phone.

15:24.583 --> 15:25.685
Exactly.

15:25.718 --> 15:26.585
<i>Uh, ma'am?</i>

15:28.086 --> 15:29.454
I'm selling
air-conditioning units

15:29.488 --> 15:31.824
for a company
called Clear Breeze.

15:49.374 --> 15:52.210
<i>Hospital and Mental
Health Center, my ass.</i>

15:52.244 --> 15:54.346
<i>Discharging a nut like her.</i>

15:57.349 --> 15:58.785
<i>If I had friends,</i>

15:58.818 --> 16:01.788
<i>I don't even know how I
would describe her to them.</i>

16:01.821 --> 16:03.422
<i>And they wouldn't understand.</i>

16:04.057 --> 16:07.192
<i>Five, ten, 11, 12, 13...</i>

16:08.126 --> 16:10.763
<i>Good thing she's with me.</i>

16:10.797 --> 16:12.832
<i>I've always wanted a little sister.</i>

16:33.318 --> 16:34.921
Emma, is there something
you wanna tell me?

16:34.954 --> 16:35.922
No.

16:39.558 --> 16:40.492
Emma?

16:40.525 --> 16:42.160
Did you go to the bathroom
in your dress?

16:42.594 --> 16:43.763
No.

16:43.796 --> 16:44.998
Yes. Yes, you did.

16:45.031 --> 16:46.331
You pooped your pants.

16:46.365 --> 16:48.101
Well, mommy says I'm not
allowed to eat peanut butter.

16:48.133 --> 16:49.636
Then why did you eat
the sandwich?

16:52.504 --> 16:54.506
Who's your best friend?

16:55.775 --> 16:56.943
I don't have a best friend.

16:57.576 --> 16:58.778
Why?

16:59.344 --> 17:00.813
I don't really relate.

17:01.580 --> 17:02.749
Why?

17:03.315 --> 17:05.450
I don't know.

17:05.484 --> 17:08.721
Mm. My best friend
is really old.

17:10.188 --> 17:12.491
- Who's your best friend?
- You.

17:13.726 --> 17:15.227
I'm not that old.

17:15.260 --> 17:17.096
How old are you? Like, two?

17:17.130 --> 17:18.363
Four.

17:23.268 --> 17:25.470
Are you a boy? Or a girl?

17:25.938 --> 17:27.272
I'm a girl.

17:28.941 --> 17:30.208
Oh.

17:54.599 --> 17:56.334
Is something wrong
with the soup?

17:57.837 --> 17:58.871
It's green.

18:00.807 --> 18:02.541
Were you trying
to kill yourself today?

18:04.476 --> 18:05.544
No.

18:05.577 --> 18:07.680
- Do you want to die?
- No.

18:08.346 --> 18:10.016
Well, you almost did.

18:10.049 --> 18:11.784
You have to look both ways.

18:11.818 --> 18:14.553
I'm not going to do that
again, Martha.

18:16.254 --> 18:17.622
Good.

18:41.914 --> 18:43.182
I have to tell you something

18:43.216 --> 18:44.717
about what happened yesterday.

18:45.852 --> 18:46.919
I'd appreciate that.

18:48.320 --> 18:50.022
I looked in one of your tins.

18:51.090 --> 18:52.058
Okay?

18:53.391 --> 18:55.928
I saw Jesus in your tin.

19:01.433 --> 19:02.935
What do you remember
about yesterday?

19:05.738 --> 19:08.074
You boss told you you're pretty
much gonna lose your job.

19:11.110 --> 19:12.344
Something wrong?

19:18.383 --> 19:19.786
<i>Hello?</i>

19:19.819 --> 19:21.419
Good morning, my name is Martha...

19:21.453 --> 19:24.223
I'm calling to see if you're interested in...

19:24.257 --> 19:25.725
Good morning,
my name is Martha Plant

19:25.758 --> 19:27.059
and I'm calling to see
if you're interested

19:27.093 --> 19:28.928
in staying extra cool
this summer.

19:28.961 --> 19:30.562
<i>Wait, what is this?</i>

19:30.595 --> 19:32.064
I'm selling
air-conditioning units.

19:32.098 --> 19:33.866
<i>Yeah. Don't call here again!</i>

19:44.409 --> 19:47.312
Elephants are apparently
the most amazing mothers.

19:47.345 --> 19:50.683
Carrying their babies for 20
months inside their bellies.

19:50.716 --> 19:52.752
And they stay together
for 16 years.

19:53.252 --> 19:54.452
Just like humans.

19:55.288 --> 19:57.355
I can't wait to have children.

19:57.389 --> 19:59.357
<i>Well, sweetheart,
it's exhausting</i>

19:59.391 --> 20:00.860
<i>but it's worth it.</i>

20:00.893 --> 20:01.961
Oh, I bet.

20:01.994 --> 20:04.797
<i>My eldest...
Been a challenge, all right.</i>

20:04.831 --> 20:06.732
<i>The only thing
he wants to date,</i>

20:06.766 --> 20:08.567
<i>is an accident.</i>

20:56.816 --> 20:57.783
<i>Hello?</i>

20:57.817 --> 20:58.985
Hi.

20:59.018 --> 21:00.052
I'm Martha Plant.

21:02.822 --> 21:04.156
How are you?

21:04.190 --> 21:05.358
<i>I'm okay.</i>

21:05.390 --> 21:06.591
<i>How are you?</i>

21:07.026 --> 21:08.060
I'm fine.

21:10.528 --> 21:11.898
I'm calling to see
if you're interested

21:11.931 --> 21:14.000
in staying extra cool
this summer.

21:14.033 --> 21:15.500
<i>What does that mean?</i>

21:15.533 --> 21:17.670
We have a once in a lifetime
special going on here

21:17.703 --> 21:19.471
at Clear Breeze
air-conditioning.

21:19.504 --> 21:21.473
One unit now, for $199.

21:21.506 --> 21:24.076
<i>What does it usually cost?</i>

21:24.110 --> 21:25.543
About the same.

21:25.577 --> 21:28.580
<i>Ah, okay.
Okay, tell me about it.</i>

21:31.817 --> 21:33.085
Its...

21:33.119 --> 21:34.720
It will cool the air.

21:35.321 --> 21:36.689
<i>Well, what else?</i>

21:43.729 --> 21:45.665
It's just
an air-conditioning unit.

21:45.698 --> 21:47.099
<i>I don't... I don't know.</i>

21:47.133 --> 21:49.534
<i>I mean, do you have,
like a catalogue,</i>

21:49.567 --> 21:50.870
<i>you could send me or something?</i>

21:55.074 --> 21:56.776
I like Pina coladas.

21:56.809 --> 21:57.743
<i>Okay.</i>

22:00.413 --> 22:01.747
I do.

22:03.182 --> 22:04.616
Do you?

22:04.650 --> 22:06.152
<i>I mean,
it's been a while.</i>

22:07.119 --> 22:08.154
Yeah.

22:09.221 --> 22:10.957
<i>Oh, okay.</i>

22:11.424 --> 22:12.425
Okay, what?

22:12.457 --> 22:13.893
<i>I'll take it.</i>

22:13.926 --> 22:15.094
You'll take what?

22:15.127 --> 22:16.329
<i>The air-conditioner.</i>

22:16.362 --> 22:17.630
Really?

23:10.515 --> 23:12.651
<i>♪ Why won't you have fun ♪</i>

23:14.120 --> 23:15.254
<i>♪ When it's easy</i>

23:16.455 --> 23:19.524
<i>♪ To give up on my love</i>

23:19.557 --> 23:22.895
<i>♪ When you tease me</i>

23:22.928 --> 23:26.165

23:31.637 --> 23:34.840
<i>♪ Destiny is calling ♪</i>

23:38.978 --> 23:40.112
Martha?

23:40.379 --> 23:41.647
Yeah?

23:43.049 --> 23:44.549
I saw something.

23:44.582 --> 23:46.118
Um, in a tin.

23:47.420 --> 23:48.687
It wasn't Jesus.

23:48.721 --> 23:49.955
That's good.

23:49.989 --> 23:51.690
It was Moses.

23:51.724 --> 23:53.859
He parted the sea
and I was running through it.

23:53.893 --> 23:56.028
I was running
as fast as I could.

23:56.062 --> 23:57.496
But I couldn't keep up
with the Israelites...

23:57.530 --> 23:58.798
- Sadie?
- Yeah?

23:58.831 --> 24:01.367
Did you talk to doctors
at Bridges about this?

24:01.400 --> 24:03.335
I wasn't seeing anything then.

24:03.369 --> 24:04.937
I think you need to see someone.

24:05.771 --> 24:07.873
I think
I'm receiving information.

24:07.907 --> 24:09.708
I think you're hallucinating.

24:12.978 --> 24:14.980
Something in your head
is making this stuff up.

24:20.019 --> 24:22.288
I want to go
see someone about this.

24:22.321 --> 24:23.556
- Who?
- Jesus.

24:23.588 --> 24:25.858
Jesus is not a doctor.

24:25.891 --> 24:27.693
He's not a good person
to talk to.

24:28.627 --> 24:30.062
Well then,
I'll just go talk to God.

24:34.633 --> 24:35.935
<i>Hello?</i>

24:35.968 --> 24:37.169
- Hello, Mr. Cox, this is Martha...
- <i>Martha.</i>

24:37.670 --> 24:38.938
<i>Hi.</i>

24:41.373 --> 24:42.374
I was calling to thank you

24:42.408 --> 24:43.409
for your purchase of our

24:43.442 --> 24:45.010
Clear Breeze
air-conditioning system.

24:45.044 --> 24:46.278
It is shipped
and should be arriving.

24:46.312 --> 24:47.279
<i>Does it get old?</i>

24:47.313 --> 24:50.382
- What?
- <i>You know, your spew.</i>

24:50.416 --> 24:52.017
I don't say that line that much.

24:52.451 --> 24:53.719
<i>Why not?</i>

24:55.020 --> 24:56.722
I haven't sold a unit in months.

24:58.858 --> 25:01.227
<i>You... you're funny.</i>

25:04.263 --> 25:05.464
Thanks.

25:05.498 --> 25:07.766
When you say
you saw Jesus,

25:07.800 --> 25:09.268
in the tin,

25:10.469 --> 25:12.872
you mean
you just felt him, right?

25:13.139 --> 25:14.206
No.

25:14.773 --> 25:16.909
I could've touched him.

25:16.942 --> 25:19.845
And at first,
I was so scared but...

25:19.879 --> 25:22.448
Now I feel like I'm supposed
to be watching.

25:22.481 --> 25:23.949
Like, he's showing
himself to me,

25:23.983 --> 25:25.885
the way he shows himself to you.

25:25.918 --> 25:28.754
It's not so visible, Sadie.

25:29.622 --> 25:31.724
I don't actually see Jesus

25:31.757 --> 25:33.425
or any of his word.

25:33.859 --> 25:35.928
I just feel him.

25:35.961 --> 25:38.731
<i>I don't know
what kind of person you are</i>

25:38.764 --> 25:40.332
<i>but I was walking
down the aisle today.</i>

25:40.366 --> 25:42.434
<i>I was in this supermarket
and I stopped</i>

25:42.468 --> 25:44.570
<i>and I... I didn't know</i>

25:44.603 --> 25:46.438
<i>what the heck
I was doing there.</i>

25:46.472 --> 25:48.507
<i>Not in the crazy sense, but...</i>

25:49.341 --> 25:50.743
<i>Sometimes I wonder,</i>

25:51.177 --> 25:52.411
<i>what I'm doing.</i>

25:52.444 --> 25:55.581
<i>Like, really doing.</i>

25:55.614 --> 25:56.882
<i>Are you kidding me?</i>

25:58.817 --> 26:00.019
<i>What an insult.</i>

26:00.853 --> 26:03.189
<i>Like I'm gonna
use a dirty toothpick.</i>

27:04.283 --> 27:05.217
What are you doing?

27:08.754 --> 27:10.289
This is my favorite room.

27:18.397 --> 27:19.865
What are you doing here?

27:21.133 --> 27:21.834
What?

27:21.867 --> 27:23.369
In this house?

27:26.472 --> 27:27.873
I grew up here.

27:28.474 --> 27:29.341
Oh.

27:29.942 --> 27:31.010
So this was...

27:31.610 --> 27:32.478
I get it.

27:33.579 --> 27:34.613
It's cute.

27:39.753 --> 27:41.053
I didn't know you drink.

27:43.022 --> 27:44.290
Did you want some?

27:48.628 --> 27:50.496
So are we gonna
get in the wagon?

27:51.363 --> 27:52.298
Not today.

27:54.867 --> 27:56.636
You should speak louder.

27:58.404 --> 27:59.104
What?

27:59.138 --> 28:00.973
Really?
How dare you.

28:01.006 --> 28:02.841
- I don't know what you're...
- I can't hear you.

28:02.875 --> 28:04.109
- I'm talking...
- Speak louder.

28:04.143 --> 28:05.244
- I don't want to.
- Do it.

28:05.277 --> 28:06.145
No!

28:10.282 --> 28:11.150
Who are you?

28:11.617 --> 28:12.584
I'm Angie.

28:13.619 --> 28:14.586
Where's Sadie?

28:15.921 --> 28:18.357
Sadie leaves
when she's feeling bad.

28:29.769 --> 28:31.403
<i>I'm Martha Plant.</i>

28:31.437 --> 28:32.706
And I'm gonna admit it.

28:32.739 --> 28:35.207
The heat is real.

28:38.844 --> 28:40.913
Is it hot where you are?
The weather?

28:40.946 --> 28:42.915
<i>Yeah,
it's pretty horrible.</i>

28:42.948 --> 28:44.383
<i>You're in
the desert, too.</i>

28:44.416 --> 28:45.652
<i>I am.</i>

28:45.685 --> 28:47.853
<i>It's so hard
talking to strangers, man.</i>

28:47.886 --> 28:49.756
I sell these
air-conditioning units

28:49.789 --> 28:52.491
so just thanks for listening.

28:54.293 --> 28:56.929
How about you?
What's your name?

28:56.962 --> 28:59.264
<i>Ma'am, for the third time,
my name is Eric.</i>

29:02.601 --> 29:04.203
What happened to you guys?

29:04.236 --> 29:06.773
We're from
the rainbowfish family.

29:06.806 --> 29:08.107
Rainbowfish.

29:08.941 --> 29:10.209
It's a sex cult.

29:10.609 --> 29:11.477
We escaped.

29:13.747 --> 29:14.814
You're tough.

29:14.848 --> 29:19.017
Yeah. A lot tougher than Sadie.

29:19.051 --> 29:21.487
Too bad she gets
all the screen time.

29:21.520 --> 29:24.490
Aren't I more equipped
for the real world?

29:24.523 --> 29:25.958
The real world sucks.

29:25.991 --> 29:29.328
Yeah. She gets better,
what happens to me?

29:35.067 --> 29:39.004
So when people
ask what you do...

29:39.037 --> 29:42.040
Do you say you're a telemarketer or
do you tell them you're like a...

29:42.074 --> 29:43.409
I'm a planter.

29:43.976 --> 29:45.678
- Right.
- Yeah.

29:46.679 --> 29:49.682
Yeah. It's, like, totally odd.

29:51.250 --> 29:55.387
I mean, people actually
pick your stuff up.

29:56.088 --> 29:57.489
It's insane.

29:58.725 --> 30:01.260
I mean, you should be proud.

30:02.394 --> 30:04.997
You're doing something
really asinine and it's working.

30:06.633 --> 30:08.100
I think I wanna throw up.

30:20.279 --> 30:21.313
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Good morning.

30:21.346 --> 30:23.282
- My name is Martha Plant.
- <i>Yes.</i>

30:24.784 --> 30:26.018
"Yes" what?

30:26.051 --> 30:28.721
<i>I will take it.
Whatever you're selling.</i>

30:28.755 --> 30:30.422
It's an air-conditioning unit.

30:30.924 --> 30:31.791
<i>Yes.</i>

30:32.324 --> 30:34.026
For $199.

30:34.059 --> 30:36.528
<i>Yes, yes, yes.</i>

30:36.562 --> 30:39.632
- Why?
- <i>I'm working on saying "yes" more in my life.</i>

30:39.666 --> 30:42.301
<i>This guy on the radio said
the most successful people...</i>

30:53.011 --> 30:54.012
You have different people

30:54.046 --> 30:55.414
living inside of you?

30:59.886 --> 31:00.753
I know.

31:02.789 --> 31:03.656
Really?

31:04.757 --> 31:05.624
Yeah.

31:07.092 --> 31:09.361
People at Bridges
told me about them.

31:11.263 --> 31:12.130
Oh.

31:15.534 --> 31:17.369
Is there a way
to get rid of them?

31:19.171 --> 31:20.807
They were trying
to get us all to meet.

31:22.007 --> 31:24.644
If Jesus wants us to, we will.

31:29.014 --> 31:30.717
I had a pet possum, too.

31:30.750 --> 31:31.985
<i>Really?</i>

31:32.017 --> 31:32.919
He died at four.

31:32.952 --> 31:35.420
<i>Oh.</i>

31:35.454 --> 31:38.123
You know you're choosing cool
when you choose Clear Breeze.

31:38.156 --> 31:39.224
<i>Can't wait.</i>

31:42.094 --> 31:45.264
Waffles during the summer can only
be enjoyed during the cool weather.

31:45.297 --> 31:46.633
<i>You make a good point.</i>

32:05.785 --> 32:06.653
<i>Hello?</i>

32:07.319 --> 32:09.621
- Hi.
- <i>Hi, Martha.</i>

32:09.656 --> 32:10.857
Uh, how are you?

32:11.991 --> 32:13.458
<i>Apparently, you know?</i>

32:13.492 --> 32:16.395
<i>Here and there. How about you?</i>

32:20.232 --> 32:21.801
It's been weird.

32:30.475 --> 32:31.911
Martha Poop.

32:31.945 --> 32:34.013
That's what they
called me in school.

32:34.047 --> 32:39.184
<i>Stinky cocks in your socks.
That was mine. But pardon me.</i>

32:39.217 --> 32:40.285
It's okay.

32:41.219 --> 32:42.287
<i>Well...</i>

32:43.188 --> 32:45.324
<i>probably made
you stronger, huh?</i>

32:46.425 --> 32:47.359
Probably.

Where I am with God.

33:21.661 --> 33:23.796
God sent that rainbow
as a promise, but...

33:24.396 --> 33:25.732
my presence broke it.

33:27.132 --> 33:29.201
I think
it's interesting, Sadie.

33:31.136 --> 33:33.338
What are these
tins for?

33:33.372 --> 33:34.573
Home, where there's a planter.

33:36.575 --> 33:37.442
A what?

33:40.212 --> 33:41.748
I can't, I'm...

33:42.447 --> 33:43.983

- I just...

33:45.051 --> 33:46.351
I want to help you.

33:47.185 --> 33:49.354
I just need
to understand more.

33:55.327 --> 33:57.396
<i>What's the purpose
of it?</i>

33:57.429 --> 33:59.498
I mean, she makes
a little money.

33:59.999 --> 34:01.134
I see.

34:01.166 --> 34:03.268
But, but it's more
than that, it's...

34:03.301 --> 34:05.672
it's a really beautiful
process and...

34:05.705 --> 34:06.773
It comforts her.

34:07.140 --> 34:08.007
Right.

34:10.777 --> 34:11.644
What?

34:12.310 --> 34:13.378
I believe...

34:14.513 --> 34:16.548
I believe you're
seeing something.

34:16.849 --> 34:17.717
Oh.

34:18.250 --> 34:19.317
Good.

34:20.086 --> 34:21.420
But it's not him.

34:23.156 --> 34:24.322
What do you mean?

34:24.991 --> 34:26.926
Works of darkness,
Sadie.

34:27.492 --> 34:29.294
I don't understand.

34:29.327 --> 34:31.731
I wouldn't open
those tins no more.

34:33.398 --> 34:36.803
I don't think Martha has
a good spirit around her.

34:53.019 --> 34:56.923
You what? No. No way.

34:56.956 --> 34:58.623
That's not gonna
work for me.

35:00.793 --> 35:02.394
I'm broke down.

35:02.427 --> 35:04.563
I'm hungry, I...

35:05.363 --> 35:08.467
I'm in the middle
of nowhere, man.

35:08.500 --> 35:11.871
Well, what am I going to do
for four days?

35:11.904 --> 35:13.438
Suck my thumb?

35:14.841 --> 35:15.708

35:24.117 --> 35:24.984

35:41.834 --> 35:43.568
It just looked like
a brown paper bag

35:43.602 --> 35:46.105
just laying
in the road and, uh,

35:46.139 --> 35:48.674
I look in rearview
and I realize

35:48.708 --> 35:50.910
the brown paper bag
is this big,

35:50.943 --> 35:53.112
fat squirrel.

35:53.146 --> 35:55.047
And I got so lost

35:55.081 --> 35:57.984
looking at this
poor guy,

35:58.017 --> 36:01.053
I just drove right off
the road and smack,

36:01.754 --> 36:03.622
right into
a street light.

36:08.127 --> 36:09.494
I didn't get
your name.

36:10.029 --> 36:11.697
Uh, this is Sadie.

36:11.731 --> 36:13.032
- Hi.
- Hi.

36:14.499 --> 36:16.035
Are you friends?

36:16.068 --> 36:17.870
We're best friends.

36:18.838 --> 36:19.839
Are you together?

36:19.872 --> 36:23.608
We've been together
for about a week or so.

36:24.811 --> 36:27.379
I didn't know you
were in a relationship.

36:29.215 --> 36:30.082
We're not.

36:31.050 --> 36:31.918
Oh.

36:34.287 --> 36:37.089
But you know
this primordial

36:37.123 --> 36:40.525
towing company can't get a truck
out here for a couple of days.

36:41.828 --> 36:42.795
If it's okay,

36:42.829 --> 36:45.597
I'll just need a ride
to the closest motel.

36:47.099 --> 36:47.967
Okay.

36:51.403 --> 36:52.905
What about you?

36:52.939 --> 36:53.806
What do you do?

36:56.242 --> 36:57.944
Now, I have
something new going.

36:59.511 --> 37:01.080
But it's just the
beginning, you know.

37:02.949 --> 37:05.952
We make acupuncture
needles for animals.

37:06.953 --> 37:08.620
I love needles.

37:09.655 --> 37:10.522
Yeah.

37:13.259 --> 37:16.095
It makes me happy.

37:21.200 --> 37:22.902
My mother...

37:25.705 --> 37:28.674
She died
three days ago.

37:34.947 --> 37:39.051
She had
necrotizing fasciitis.

37:43.222 --> 37:45.490
A flesh eating bacteria.

37:48.560 --> 37:50.763
I didn't know
you were so...

37:50.796 --> 37:53.199
I didn't know you
were so young, Martha.

37:59.005 --> 38:02.607
Well, you should
stay here, you know.

38:02.642 --> 38:05.978
Until that truck can get
your car back to San Diego.

38:06.646 --> 38:08.214
We'd love
your company.

38:19.759 --> 38:20.625
Mm.

38:21.559 --> 38:23.495
Martha, what gave
you the idea

38:23.528 --> 38:25.364
to put peanut butter
on both sides of bread

38:25.398 --> 38:26.899
with a layer of jelly
in between?

38:27.565 --> 38:28.734
It was an accident.

38:30.535 --> 38:32.838
Moment of spontaneity
are so magical.

38:37.410 --> 38:40.246
Oh, I'm really glad
we're all here.

38:41.314 --> 38:43.548
He put us together
for a reason.

38:43.950 --> 38:44.817
Who?

38:45.284 --> 38:46.185
Jesus.

38:51.857 --> 38:53.893
Thanks for letting
me crash, Martha.

38:55.493 --> 38:57.096
Yeah.

38:57.129 --> 38:59.065
I don't know when this towing
company is going to get it together.

39:00.232 --> 39:02.600
But I can leave
at any time.

39:03.202 --> 39:04.637
It's fine.

39:04.670 --> 39:08.007
I mean... no one else
is using the couch.

39:08.040 --> 39:08.908
Right.

39:10.009 --> 39:10.876
Well...

39:13.279 --> 39:14.146
Thank you.

39:17.683 --> 39:19.051
I'm sorry, Richard.

39:23.255 --> 39:24.123
Goodnight.

39:26.125 --> 39:27.059
Goodnight, Martha.

39:49.348 --> 39:51.183
<i>I gave them a
perfectly good screwdriver</i>

39:51.217 --> 39:53.486
<i>and all they gave
me back was nothing.</i>

39:53.518 --> 39:55.087
<i>Great.</i>

39:55.121 --> 39:57.957
<i>Unfortunately, Richard won't be
able to fully grasp my process.</i>

40:30.823 --> 40:33.993
I hear electric wheelchairs
are all the rave right now.

40:34.460 --> 40:35.327
<i>Really?</i>

40:44.503 --> 40:46.072
The water pressure's
very powerful,

40:46.105 --> 40:47.640
don't you think?

40:47.673 --> 40:49.141
You know, you get
cleaner that way.

40:50.743 --> 40:52.311
Well, I used to like
being naked...

40:52.344 --> 40:53.712
...when I was sad.

40:54.612 --> 40:56.048
I dig when I'm sad.

41:00.186 --> 41:03.189
I... I've never stolen
anything in my life.

Come here.

42:33.913 --> 42:36.115

won't wake up.

42:36.549 --> 42:37.483
Come here.

42:37.516 --> 42:39.385

42:43.489 --> 42:44.390
No!

42:48.093 --> 42:49.728

Sadie?

42:49.762 --> 42:51.063
Who are you?

42:51.096 --> 42:51.964
Who am I?

42:57.937 --> 43:00.272
Is your butt
dirty too?

43:01.507 --> 43:03.008
No.

43:03.042 --> 43:05.377
Is the homeless man's
butt dirty?

43:06.412 --> 43:07.513
No.

43:07.546 --> 43:08.847
Did you clean it?

43:09.548 --> 43:10.883
He cleaned
his own butt.

43:12.084 --> 43:12.952
Oh.

43:15.788 --> 43:18.123
You like his butt?

43:21.260 --> 43:22.127
Yeah.

43:23.462 --> 43:24.530
He has a nice butt.

43:38.510 --> 43:39.545
Martha.

43:43.415 --> 43:44.283
Martha?

43:46.318 --> 43:47.186
<i>What?</i>

43:51.725 --> 43:52.992
<i>It's just bad luck.</i>

43:53.025 --> 43:54.226
<i>It won't happen again.</i>

43:55.327 --> 43:58.097
<i>Put my flier up,
he'll take it.</i>

43:58.130 --> 43:59.798
<i>He'll read it clearly.</i>

43:59.832 --> 44:01.300
<i>He'll dig it up.</i>

44:01.333 --> 44:03.002

44:03.569 --> 44:04.638
<i>And give me cash.</i>

<i>Cash.</i>

44:07.806 --> 44:09.174
<i>Everything
will be fine.</i>

44:16.915 --> 44:19.418
Does she know she becomes
someone else?

44:20.386 --> 44:21.253
Yeah.

44:22.722 --> 44:24.223
But it's not
in her control.

44:27.694 --> 44:29.528
My Ma crapped
in her pants, too.

44:30.863 --> 44:32.064
I mean, at the end.

44:38.638 --> 44:40.072
Uh, just...

44:42.141 --> 44:45.645
Just... punch me
in the face.

44:49.248 --> 44:51.450
I should have spent
more time with her.

44:53.753 --> 44:54.688
What would that do?

44:55.821 --> 44:56.690
What?

44:57.623 --> 44:59.491
If I punched you
in the face.

45:11.671 --> 45:15.040
My parents were decapitated
in a car accident a year ago.

45:16.608 --> 45:18.077
I thought they were
going to die in their sleep

45:18.110 --> 45:19.244
like normal people.

45:22.682 --> 45:24.550
I'm... I'm sorry, Martha.

45:25.250 --> 45:26.952
I knew they'd
be dead soon,

45:26.985 --> 45:28.287
but I still locked
myself in my room

45:28.320 --> 45:29.988
when they asked me
to go to bingo.

45:33.158 --> 45:34.661
I kind of
hate myself now.

45:38.665 --> 45:40.232
I hate myself, too.

45:50.844 --> 45:51.711
Hey.

45:54.513 --> 45:55.381
Morning.

45:55.849 --> 45:57.149
I'm sorry.

45:57.549 --> 45:58.417
It's fine.

46:05.224 --> 46:08.293
I had a dream I was
on a ferry selling lemonade.

46:09.094 --> 46:10.429
And it was going well.

46:11.196 --> 46:12.364
I was selling a lot.

46:15.067 --> 46:16.502
Then I saw Carl.

46:20.807 --> 46:22.374
What did you like about him?

46:26.044 --> 46:27.446
I liked his hair.

46:34.754 --> 46:36.121
What do you
like about him?

46:37.456 --> 46:38.323
Who?

46:39.759 --> 46:40.626
Richard.

46:45.531 --> 46:46.498
He' weird.

46:53.939 --> 46:55.374
<i>I'll take it.</i>

46:55.407 --> 46:58.711
<i>Oh, I can't wait to wear
my birthday suit all day.</i>

47:00.145 --> 47:02.047
<i>Pay me the...</i>

47:18.765 --> 47:20.700
<i>Who the hell
is doing this to me?</i>

47:20.733 --> 47:22.067
<i>This is sabotage.</i>

47:22.100 --> 47:23.402
<i>This guy is sick!</i>

47:23.435 --> 47:26.104
<i>What kind of fre steals
from a business like mine?</i>

47:28.173 --> 47:29.408
<i>I bet he's ugly</i>

47:29.441 --> 47:31.610
<i>and eats cheesy puffs
for breakfast.</i>

47:42.287 --> 47:44.256
Or maybe, they don't
have much to give.

47:50.062 --> 47:51.865
Or maybe, they're new
to the process.

47:51.898 --> 47:52.765
I doubt it.

47:54.634 --> 47:57.169
Maybe they're confused.
I know I am.

47:57.202 --> 47:58.403
Confused about what?

47:59.171 --> 48:00.874
It's just a couple
of dollars.

48:00.907 --> 48:02.307
It's not about the money.

48:02.341 --> 48:03.810
Maybe they're from
out of town.

48:03.843 --> 48:04.777
Who cares.

48:04.811 --> 48:05.945
Maybe it's a joke.

48:05.979 --> 48:06.946
It's not funny.

48:06.980 --> 48:08.180
Well, maybe they're...

48:10.082 --> 48:11.784
Fucked up!

48:22.294 --> 48:23.663
Richard, this is Angie.

48:24.898 --> 48:25.765
Hi.

48:30.302 --> 48:31.503
How many are there?

48:32.639 --> 48:33.505
Three.

48:36.709 --> 48:38.176
Enjoying your vacation?

48:39.077 --> 48:41.580
- Uh-huh, yeah.
- Yeah.

48:42.414 --> 48:44.216
You really like Martha,
don't you?

48:44.249 --> 48:45.617
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

48:45.652 --> 48:46.518
Feels good, huh?

48:48.120 --> 48:49.187
Yeah.

48:50.155 --> 48:53.927
What are you
like, 70, 75?

48:54.493 --> 48:56.061
What?

48:56.094 --> 48:57.496
I mean, can you
still get it up?

49:24.122 --> 49:25.792
My mother's dead.

49:26.826 --> 49:27.694
We know.

49:32.598 --> 49:33.465
I mean...

49:34.566 --> 49:35.434
We're sorry.

49:40.372 --> 49:43.375
I'm just waiting
for the tow truck company.

49:45.110 --> 49:47.479
I think you're here
for other reasons.

49:48.681 --> 49:50.016
Where you the one

49:50.049 --> 49:51.718
locking the helmet
on Emma's head?

49:51.751 --> 49:52.618
What helmet?

49:53.853 --> 49:54.954
Why did you
do that?

49:56.656 --> 49:57.522
Oh, it's like...

49:58.658 --> 49:59.524
It's like...

50:00.860 --> 50:01.728
Protection.

50:18.745 --> 50:21.546
If you had to be stuck
in the closet with someone

50:21.580 --> 50:22.915
for the rest
of your life,

50:23.750 --> 50:24.917
who would it be?

50:24.951 --> 50:26.418
Does it have
to be a person?

50:27.086 --> 50:27.954
No.

50:28.855 --> 50:30.990
Then, my dead dog,
Taco.

50:33.291 --> 50:35.394
Of all things
you planted,

50:35.427 --> 50:36.663
what was
your favorite?

50:38.363 --> 50:39.832
A taxidermy raccoon.

50:45.170 --> 50:47.372
Have you ever been
in love, Martha?

50:51.844 --> 50:52.712
No.

50:56.581 --> 50:57.984
Why are you
still alone?

51:00.953 --> 51:01.921
I don't know.

51:05.792 --> 51:06.659
I'm just...

51:09.729 --> 51:11.864
I'm never real
comfortable, you know.

51:13.331 --> 51:14.433
And, uh...

51:15.935 --> 51:17.502
You kinda
have to be.

51:19.038 --> 51:20.405
To be with someone.

51:30.282 --> 51:32.350
I got to tell you
something, Martha.

51:34.319 --> 51:37.090
I like being on this side of
things, I do.

51:38.791 --> 51:40.492
But it is a little tough
listening to you,

51:40.525 --> 51:42.227
rather air
conditioning calls.

51:42.260 --> 51:43.328
I mean...

51:44.063 --> 51:45.665
I get heavy
in my heart.

51:46.465 --> 51:48.266
I can't get it out
of my head,

51:48.300 --> 51:49.334
that maybe,

51:49.367 --> 51:51.204
maybe you talk
to other people

51:51.236 --> 51:52.672
the way you
talk to me.

51:54.439 --> 51:57.409
That I'm not
that special.

52:18.631 --> 52:20.465
Can I confirm the spelling
of your last name?

52:20.499 --> 52:22.068
<i>Oh, sure.</i>

52:22.101 --> 52:24.036
You look splendid, Richard.

52:25.337 --> 52:29.208
- Thank you, Sadie.
- Your eyes are shining.

52:29.242 --> 52:30.943
You must be feeling better.

52:33.378 --> 52:34.680
I am.

52:35.848 --> 52:38.017
<i>That's correct.</i>

52:38.050 --> 52:39.351
Thank you.

52:39.384 --> 52:40.585
And you know
you're choosing cool

52:40.619 --> 52:44.023
and you choose Clear Breeze

52:44.056 --> 52:45.892
Can you please pass the chalk?

52:49.762 --> 52:50.830
Sorry.

53:44.083 --> 53:45.985
Hm. This should pass.

53:54.392 --> 53:56.629
Where were you before Martha?

53:58.297 --> 53:59.665
I was in love.

54:02.935 --> 54:04.569
That's nice.

54:04.603 --> 54:07.606
Yeah. I think
you would've liked Carl.

54:16.949 --> 54:18.885
You think she'll ever
get over it?

54:18.918 --> 54:19.785
What?

54:21.386 --> 54:23.289
The tin stuff.

54:23.322 --> 54:25.925
- I hope not.
- Why?

54:25.958 --> 54:28.160
Because if she
never sees anything,

54:28.194 --> 54:29.695
then I really am crazy.

56:15.735 --> 56:17.336
What did you see?

56:18.270 --> 56:19.772
I saw the Rapture.

56:20.873 --> 56:22.808
I was left behind...

56:23.709 --> 56:25.111
and so were you.

56:34.619 --> 56:35.921
Sadie...

56:37.089 --> 56:39.392

56:50.002 --> 56:51.971
Uh,
It very well could be.

56:52.004 --> 56:56.709
That's great. You call my husband that
name and I'm gonna have you a boyfriend tonight.

57:07.653 --> 57:09.355
<i>Dead. Dead.</i>

57:10.122 --> 57:12.358
<i>Dead! Dead!</i>

57:12.391 --> 57:13.392
<i>Dead!</i>

57:13.426 --> 57:15.261
Why would someone
want to sabotage my business?

57:15.294 --> 57:16.629
I have no idea.

57:16.662 --> 57:19.564
I mean, it's one of the most
successful enterprises in the area.

57:19.597 --> 57:21.067
- Oh, I know.
- What?

57:21.100 --> 57:23.369
Someone would really do this
out of jealousy?

57:23.402 --> 57:25.905
This is a real sicko!

57:25.938 --> 57:28.474
- Martha.
- This is why I can't do people.

57:28.507 --> 57:29.742
- Martha.
- What?

57:29.775 --> 57:30.976
- It just slipped.
- What?

57:31.010 --> 57:33.679
But today, I saw him
with a yellow screwdriver.

57:33.712 --> 57:35.915
- What?
- I'm so sorry, Martha.

57:35.948 --> 57:38.651
- Please forgive me.
- What are you talking about?

57:38.684 --> 57:41.053
I told Jesus
about your planting!

57:42.054 --> 57:42.855
What?

57:42.888 --> 57:45.658
I told Jesus
that you're the planter.

57:45.691 --> 57:47.293
Who's Jesus?

57:49.428 --> 57:50.729
Jesus!

57:51.764 --> 57:52.998
Martha!

57:57.703 --> 57:59.271
"Beware of false prophets

57:59.305 --> 58:01.207
"which come to you
in sheep's clothing."

58:01.240 --> 58:03.242
Why're you stealing
my plants, Jesus?

58:03.275 --> 58:04.710
Stay back, Sadie.

58:04.743 --> 58:06.745
The wolf plays ignorance.

58:06.779 --> 58:08.781
Hey. Put the bottle down, man.

58:11.550 --> 58:12.885
Stay away from my tins, Jesus.

58:12.918 --> 58:15.888
Everything in those tins
is the work of the devil.

58:15.921 --> 58:17.823
Work of the devil?

58:17.857 --> 58:19.792
I knew you were a murderer.

58:19.825 --> 58:21.994
I didn't know you were a liar!

58:22.027 --> 58:23.462
- Murderer?
- He robbed an old man

58:23.496 --> 58:26.232
of his life, when all he wanted
was a strawberry milkshake.

58:27.099 --> 58:29.668
But he never got that milkshake

58:29.702 --> 58:31.871
and I never
got my grandfather.

58:31.904 --> 58:33.572
Because you killed him!

58:33.606 --> 58:35.141
You killed her grandfather?

58:35.174 --> 58:37.409
I just shot the gun
and it hit him.

58:38.077 --> 58:38.878
Why?

58:38.911 --> 58:41.013
No one was supposed to get hurt.

58:41.714 --> 58:44.083
I'd never held a gun before.

58:45.718 --> 58:47.853
I've thought about that moment

58:47.887 --> 58:50.422
every day since I was 19.

58:53.025 --> 58:54.927
I don't know
where you come from,

58:56.162 --> 58:58.364
but I came from a trashcan.

58:59.732 --> 59:02.668
And I've made something
of myself.

59:02.701 --> 59:07.039
I'm the planter and you're not
gonna take that away from me.

59:07.072 --> 59:10.776
Now I know why you're doing
what you're doing.

59:10.809 --> 59:14.146
You're making Sadie think
I was talking to her.

59:14.180 --> 59:16.782
But don't make her
pay for my sins.

59:16.815 --> 59:18.984
That's why you've been stealing
my plants?

59:19.885 --> 59:22.254
You think
I'm putting Jesus in my tins?

59:22.288 --> 59:24.590
Well Jesus hasn't actually been
in all the tins.

59:24.623 --> 59:26.458
I have no idea what's going on.

59:29.094 --> 59:32.097
I haven't stolen
anything, Martha.

59:33.866 --> 59:36.202
I've done enough sin
in this life.

1:00:17.644 --> 1:00:18.944
Martha?

1:00:19.878 --> 1:00:21.480
Everything okay?

1:00:23.082 --> 1:00:25.384
We'll find out
who it is, Martha!

1:00:39.131 --> 1:00:42.034
7:30 a.m. breakfast.
8:00 a.m. departure.

1:00:43.703 --> 1:00:45.037
We're gonna get this guy.

1:00:49.842 --> 1:00:50.976
Richard.

1:00:52.044 --> 1:00:54.580
- Your lip is twitching.
- Really?

1:00:54.613 --> 1:00:56.081
- Yeah.
- Oh.

1:00:57.449 --> 1:00:58.584
I'm nervous too.

1:00:59.818 --> 1:01:01.153
I'm not nervous.

1:01:01.987 --> 1:01:04.256
We need to be prepared
for anything.

1:01:05.190 --> 1:01:06.693
There are real freaks out there.

1:01:06.726 --> 1:01:07.593
Yeah.

1:01:08.662 --> 1:01:10.262
It's a good thing you have me.

1:01:10.296 --> 1:01:11.563
Yeah.

1:01:11.597 --> 1:01:13.899
I mean, have you ever thought
of what could happen out there?

1:01:13.932 --> 1:01:15.401
A little.

1:01:16.736 --> 1:01:18.037
We need weapons.

1:01:19.271 --> 1:01:20.740
Okay.

1:01:20.774 --> 1:01:22.408
Well, we have a shovel.

1:01:22.441 --> 1:01:24.576
A shovel won't stop
someone with a gun.

1:01:24.610 --> 1:01:25.811
Oh, you're right.

1:01:25.844 --> 1:01:28.113
- What should we do?
- We'll bring these.

1:01:28.580 --> 1:01:30.482
Now, a knife...

1:01:31.083 --> 1:01:32.851
For obvious reasons.

1:01:32.885 --> 1:01:35.689
Put a fork in the eye.
That'll blind them.

1:01:38.123 --> 1:01:39.992
Now I don't like blood either,

1:01:40.025 --> 1:01:42.528
especially if it's coming
from the face.

1:01:42.561 --> 1:01:44.496
Well I don't wanna use a fork.

1:01:44.530 --> 1:01:47.099
Mommy always taught me
to use my hands.

1:01:47.599 --> 1:01:48.668
Okay.

1:01:49.601 --> 1:01:51.203
Use your hands.

1:02:05.084 --> 1:02:06.452
You look good.

1:02:25.104 --> 1:02:26.438
What if we miss them?

1:02:27.072 --> 1:02:28.240
What do you mean?

1:02:29.776 --> 1:02:31.210
What if they come at night?

1:02:33.212 --> 1:02:35.581
They gotta do it at night.

1:02:35.614 --> 1:02:38.384
I mean, it would be too easy
during the day.

1:02:38.417 --> 1:02:40.552
Too... too easy to get caught.

1:02:40.586 --> 1:02:42.388
It'd be hard to find
the coordinates at night.

1:02:42.421 --> 1:02:44.691
Not if they had a flashlight.

1:02:50.396 --> 1:02:53.867
Oh. Mommy says
I'm not supposed to put

1:02:53.899 --> 1:02:56.101
things in my mouth, Richard.

1:02:57.871 --> 1:03:00.506
You're right, sweetie.
It's a bad habit.

1:03:08.447 --> 1:03:09.415
What?

1:03:13.419 --> 1:03:14.420
What?

1:03:15.889 --> 1:03:18.123
You put the toothpick in my tin.

1:03:18.825 --> 1:03:20.794
What toothpick?

1:03:20.827 --> 1:03:22.695
You've been taking my plants.

1:03:23.262 --> 1:03:24.263
Oh.

1:03:24.963 --> 1:03:26.198
Martha.

1:03:26.699 --> 1:03:27.901
It was you.

1:03:27.933 --> 1:03:28.967
You've got it all wrong.

1:03:29.001 --> 1:03:30.602
You're way off track here.

1:03:30.637 --> 1:03:31.537
I'm off track?

1:03:31.570 --> 1:03:33.272
Yeah, yeah, you are.

1:03:33.305 --> 1:03:34.741
- Oh my God.
- Martha!

1:03:34.774 --> 1:03:37.209
A couple of days
after I started talking to you,

1:03:37.242 --> 1:03:39.813
- I got my first empty tin.
- What're you talking about?

1:03:39.846 --> 1:03:42.916
How would I even know
about your planting business?

1:03:42.948 --> 1:03:44.082
Everybody knows.

1:03:44.116 --> 1:03:45.919
My flyers have been coveted
for years.

1:03:45.951 --> 1:03:47.186
You're not making any sense.

1:03:47.219 --> 1:03:49.321
So you hit a squirrel
and ran into a lamp post.

1:03:49.354 --> 1:03:50.155
Come on!

1:03:50.189 --> 1:03:52.224
That fat rodent
destroyed my car!

1:03:52.257 --> 1:03:54.794
I can't believe I let you
stay with us!

1:03:54.828 --> 1:03:56.161
Is your mother even dead?

1:03:56.195 --> 1:03:58.263
I have to tell you
something, Martha Plant!

1:03:58.297 --> 1:03:59.598
Oh, it's this day
you're gonna tell me the truth?

1:03:59.632 --> 1:04:00.767
Yeah. Yeah, I am.

1:04:00.800 --> 1:04:02.067
- Then say it!
- Here I go!

1:04:02.100 --> 1:04:04.637
- Go for it!
- I love you, Martha Plant!

1:04:15.147 --> 1:04:16.482
What is she doing?

1:04:24.122 --> 1:04:25.357
What're you doing?

1:04:37.436 --> 1:04:39.438
How does it feel, Martha?

1:04:41.908 --> 1:04:43.141
Hm?

1:04:43.175 --> 1:04:46.478
How does it feel to know
that the thief

1:04:46.512 --> 1:04:50.482
has been shitting in your toilet
all along?

1:04:50.516 --> 1:04:53.352
I mean, you picked
some pretty weird places

1:04:53.385 --> 1:04:55.788
to plant shit and it's not easy

1:04:55.822 --> 1:04:58.123
getting there
in the middle of the night...

1:04:58.156 --> 1:04:59.491
when you're drunk.

1:05:00.125 --> 1:05:02.628
But I did it.

1:05:03.428 --> 1:05:04.864
And I thought you should know.

1:05:14.908 --> 1:05:16.608
I took care of you.

1:05:16.643 --> 1:05:19.177
Martha, it's just
not working out.

1:05:19.211 --> 1:05:21.046
Look at you. You're choking me.

1:05:21.079 --> 1:05:23.016
Why? Why did you do it?

1:05:23.048 --> 1:05:24.684
I like
to keep things interesting.

1:05:24.717 --> 1:05:26.753
No! Tell my why!

1:05:26.786 --> 1:05:28.387
Self-preservation!

1:05:28.420 --> 1:05:30.522
- You're sick.
- You're sick.

1:05:30.556 --> 1:05:32.591
It's just a tin with junk in it.

1:05:35.561 --> 1:05:38.430
If you kill me,
you kill Sadie too.

1:05:44.169 --> 1:05:46.371
If you care at all about Sadie,

1:05:46.405 --> 1:05:48.841
you'll tell her to forever stay
the hell away from me.

1:06:24.142 --> 1:06:26.511
- <i>Hello?</i>
- I'm Martha Plant

1:06:26.545 --> 1:06:29.548
and I'm calling
because the heat is real.

1:06:32.250 --> 1:06:34.087
<i>When it gets too hot outside,</i>

1:06:34.119 --> 1:06:36.022
<i>those beautiful flowers,
they die.</i>

1:06:36.055 --> 1:06:39.491
That's kind of what happens to
your insides when you overheat.

1:06:41.360 --> 1:06:42.929
Do you know the one thing...

1:06:42.962 --> 1:06:46.666
The one thing in this Earth
that won't let you down?

1:06:46.699 --> 1:06:48.567
Our Clear Breeze
air conditioning system.

1:06:48.600 --> 1:06:51.536
<i>Because if you let yourself be
susceptible to all the freaks out there,</i>

1:06:51.570 --> 1:06:52.839
<i>you don't know where you'll be.</i>

1:06:52.872 --> 1:06:57.010
Alone? Maybe. Is it
that bad though? Being alone?

1:06:57.043 --> 1:06:58.745
You hear that?
That's a drumroll.

1:06:58.778 --> 1:07:00.947
That's giving you ten seconds
to make your decision

1:07:00.980 --> 1:07:01.814
on whether you're gonna buy

1:07:01.848 --> 1:07:03.615
a Clear Breeze
air conditioning system.

1:07:03.650 --> 1:07:06.318
I'm waiting. The drums
are playing for you.

1:07:11.189 --> 1:07:12.825
This is the time to be cool.

1:07:12.859 --> 1:07:14.961
Because Clear Breeze is offering
you a once in a lifetime special...

1:07:16.461 --> 1:07:17.797
I'm here to help you.

1:07:18.698 --> 1:07:19.564
It's up to you.

1:07:19.598 --> 1:07:21.834
Help you, help me help you.

1:07:21.868 --> 1:07:25.705
Melt in the heat if you'd like.
Become a puddle of sweaty...

1:07:26.571 --> 1:07:27.874
<i>I'm gonna be honest here.</i>

1:07:27.907 --> 1:07:30.143
More honest than I've ever been
with anyone before.

1:07:30.175 --> 1:07:31.443
I'm about to lose my job.

1:07:31.476 --> 1:07:33.478
Don't hang up that phone.
Do not hang up that phone.

1:07:33.512 --> 1:07:36.348
We only have a limited time
on this planet.

1:07:36.381 --> 1:07:40.619
Why waste it in pain and misery?

1:07:42.354 --> 1:07:44.757
Are you sitting by
your purse right now?

1:07:45.958 --> 1:07:48.795
How hot is your hand?

1:07:49.327 --> 1:07:52.230
Sweaty? Disgusting?

1:07:52.264 --> 1:07:54.266
'Cause all you
have to do is... Zip!

1:07:54.299 --> 1:07:57.837
...open up your purse
and tell me, "Martha,

1:07:57.870 --> 1:08:00.338
"I want to buy
an air conditioning unit!"

1:08:16.321 --> 1:08:17.389
Hello?

1:08:17.422 --> 1:08:19.391
<i>Martha. Donald.</i>

1:08:21.127 --> 1:08:22.394
- Hi.
- <i>I don't know</i>

1:08:22.427 --> 1:08:24.630
<i>exactly what you did,
but it worked!</i>

1:08:24.664 --> 1:08:27.232
<i>You've sold
all 30 air conditioners.</i>

1:08:27.265 --> 1:08:29.534
- Yup.
- <i>It was a shock to me</i>

1:08:29.568 --> 1:08:33.773
<i>and I am sure it was
a shock to Enoch...</i>

1:08:33.806 --> 1:08:36.308
<i>So it looks like we'll be
flying you down to headquarters</i>

1:08:36.341 --> 1:08:37.643
<i>first class, Martha!</i>

1:08:37.677 --> 1:08:40.179
<i>You can teach everyone here
the mysterious ways</i>

1:08:40.213 --> 1:08:41.346
<i>of Ms. Martha Plant!</i>

1:08:41.379 --> 1:08:43.515
<i>Pack your bags. It's showtime!</i>

1:08:43.548 --> 1:08:45.718
<i>West Texas
is a really lovely place</i>

1:08:45.752 --> 1:08:47.519
<i>and I'm sure people
will love to meet</i>

1:08:47.552 --> 1:08:50.723
<i>the notorious and famous,
most excellent Martha Plant!</i>

1:09:21.788 --> 1:09:22.789
Thank you

1:09:23.488 --> 1:09:24.957
for your help.

1:09:24.991 --> 1:09:27.359
I sold
all the air conditioning units.

1:09:27.392 --> 1:09:29.896
Oh! That's great.

1:09:29.929 --> 1:09:32.064
They wanna fly me down
to headquarters.

1:09:32.098 --> 1:09:35.635
Wow. That's a real big deal.

1:09:35.668 --> 1:09:37.970
I've never been
on an airplane before.

1:09:38.004 --> 1:09:39.304
Me either.

1:09:39.337 --> 1:09:41.140
I hear they give free snacks.

1:09:46.746 --> 1:09:49.048
I thought you never wanted
to see me again.

1:09:51.316 --> 1:09:52.685
How did you know that?

1:09:54.987 --> 1:09:55.955
Angie.

1:09:57.023 --> 1:09:58.456
We made a deal.

1:09:58.490 --> 1:10:02.094
I told her she could stay as long
as she stops stealing your plants.

1:10:03.996 --> 1:10:07.066
I guess she was donating
them all to the church.

1:10:13.873 --> 1:10:15.074
I'm glad you met.

1:10:16.976 --> 1:10:18.144
Yeah.

1:10:19.712 --> 1:10:21.914
She's not a very nice person.

1:10:30.589 --> 1:10:32.390
<i>If it were
the apocalypse,</i>

1:10:32.424 --> 1:10:34.526
<i>and I could only
save one thing,</i>

1:10:35.393 --> 1:10:37.129
<i>I'd save my assistant.</i>

1:12:18.998 --> 1:12:20.333
Man, are you scared?

1:12:20.366 --> 1:12:21.901
Yeah.
It's not easy being a savior.

1:12:21.934 --> 1:12:23.535
I'm scared for you.

1:12:23.568 --> 1:12:24.837
It's gonna be fine.

1:12:24.870 --> 1:12:27.239
I'll finally be
completely off the grid.

1:12:27.273 --> 1:12:29.408
Off the grid? Radical, man.

1:12:29.442 --> 1:12:32.477
I'm gonna let the fuzz
take me in.

1:12:32.510 --> 1:12:34.347
Beat me up and nail me
to the tree.

1:12:34.380 --> 1:12:35.513
What about the Roman guards?

1:12:35.547 --> 1:12:37.316
The Roman guards
are gonna hide me in a tomb.

1:12:37.350 --> 1:12:39.118
And then,

1:12:39.151 --> 1:12:41.087
I'm gonna come back
from the dead.

Oh, shit. Are you okay?

1:17:31.844 --> 1:17:33.479
- Yeah.
- Oh, my God.

1:17:33.512 --> 1:17:35.614
Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh.
Oh, my gosh!

1:17:41.887 --> 1:17:44.023

Oh, shit.
