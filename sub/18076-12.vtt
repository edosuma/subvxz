NARRATOR: 10 years ago, a crack commando
unit was sent to prison by a miIitary court...

01:28.429 --> 01:30.089
for a crime they didn't commit.

01:30.181 --> 01:33.348
These men promptIy escaped
from a maximum-security stockade...

01:33.434 --> 01:35.178
to the Los AngeIes underground.

01:35.270 --> 01:38.935
Today, stiII wanted by the government,
they survive as soIdiers of fortune.

if no one eIse can heIp...

01:41.818 --> 01:45.068

maybe you can hire the A-Team.

OLLlE: Come on, Sheriff,
that was a scratch, plain as day.

03:07.879 --> 03:10.086
Hold your water, Ollie. l was just practicing.

03:10.173 --> 03:13.507
There ain't nothing in the rules
about practise shots.

03:13.677 --> 03:17.674
My rules are different than yours, Ollie.
Ain't that right, boys?

03:18.515 --> 03:20.507
Nine ball, corner pocket.

03:24.354 --> 03:26.975
We got him out back in the squad car.

03:38.368 --> 03:40.906
Hiya, Jimmy.
How's the newspaper business?

03:40.996 --> 03:43.321
Why don't you step out
so we can have a IittIe taIk?

03:43.415 --> 03:46.866
ls that what you said to Stan King
before you rolled his car in a ditch?

03:46.960 --> 03:49.533
See, that's the kind of thing
that gets you in trouble.

03:49.629 --> 03:53.129
You ain't got any right writing those Iies
about me in the newspaper.

03:53.216 --> 03:57.463
l'm running for a big election here.
People read that stuff, they get jumpy.

03:58.180 --> 04:00.219
l'm going to win, anyway.

l told them everything
and they want to help.

05:04.079 --> 05:06.404
They just have a weird schedule.

05:07.249 --> 05:11.412
Sorry, folks, l'm gonna have to ask you
to drink up. We're closing.

05:14.005 --> 05:15.334
Excuse me.

AMY: The nose is awful, but the hair,
where did you get it? Mail order?

05:26.184 --> 05:27.643
You got a problem, miss?

05:27.727 --> 05:31.725

it's ready to start purring.

-That would be nice.

-How would you like it?
-ln a cup, fool.

05:53.587 --> 05:57.419
Why would a guy wear a wig like that?
Looks like a dead plant.

05:58.091 --> 06:00.084
You're late. Where is Hannibal?

06:00.177 --> 06:02.253
Hannibal had to do some close-ups...

-Mr. Baker? Sorry we're late.
-lt's all right.

06:11.605 --> 06:15.021
Looks like Sheriff Dawson
got a little tired of you pushing him around.

06:15.108 --> 06:18.311
You'd think a guy that's sheriff for 20 years
would be more subtle.

06:18.403 --> 06:22.187
He doesn't have to be. He just flashes
his badge and throws his weight around.

06:22.282 --> 06:25.983
Anybody doesn't like it, they wind up
in jail on some trumped-up charge...

06:26.077 --> 06:28.117
-or they get beat on.
-Why not vote him out?

06:28.205 --> 06:30.778
lf anyone sounds like
they're gonna run for candidate...

06:30.874 --> 06:33.116
he buys them out
or shuts them up some way.

06:33.210 --> 06:34.455
The last was Stan King.

06:34.544 --> 06:38.376
He wound up in a ditch outside of town
the day after he announced he was running.

06:38.465 --> 06:41.170
Sounds like this guy Dawson
needs to be taught a good lesson.

06:41.259 --> 06:43.051
BAKER: Don't underestimate him. He's smart.

06:43.136 --> 06:46.007
Never leaves anything laying around
for you to pin on him later.

06:46.097 --> 06:48.767
Otherwise, l'd have taken this
to the attorney general.

06:48.850 --> 06:52.848
lf we're gonna draw this guy out,
we need to know his weak spots.

06:52.938 --> 06:55.144
-What else does he have going?
-Plenty.

06:55.232 --> 06:57.853
-Guns, money, whiskey, you name it.
-Money? Like what?

06:57.943 --> 07:01.312
Like a little casino he allows to prosper
a few miles outside of town.

07:01.404 --> 07:03.730
lt's at a place called
Danny's Satellite Lounge.

07:03.824 --> 07:06.361
He takes a piece of the action
and nobody bothers him.

07:06.451 --> 07:09.571
-And what about the whiskey?
-Side business. Smuggles the stuff.

07:09.663 --> 07:12.414
Nobody pays any tax,
he's got a built-in market.

07:12.499 --> 07:15.950
The next shipment's coming
in three days, running right up Highway 49.

07:16.044 --> 07:18.796
And you can be sure
there aren't gonna be any cops there...

07:18.880 --> 07:20.754
unless they're thirsty.

07:22.467 --> 07:23.665
Thanks.

07:26.721 --> 07:30.719
So what can we possibly come up with
to drill a guy like Dawson?

07:30.809 --> 07:34.260
We could start by running
our own candidate for sheriff.

07:34.354 --> 07:36.596
l think Hannibal would love a plan like that.

07:36.690 --> 07:39.015
l don't know. That's like asking for trouble.

07:39.109 --> 07:41.944
Running somebody against Dawson
like that. He's a killer.

07:42.028 --> 07:43.606
You're right. That's a problem.

07:43.697 --> 07:46.733
Where are we gonna find anyone
dumb enough to go to that town...

07:46.825 --> 07:49.114
and be a candidate for sheriff?

07:50.453 --> 07:52.078
l mean, nobody's that stupid.

HANNlBAL: Not a bad picture
for a campaign poster.

07:55.917 --> 08:00.129
HANNlBAL: What have we got to work with?
AMY: We have got the perfect cover.

08:00.380 --> 08:03.547
His name is Joe Morgan.
l checked with county records.

08:03.633 --> 08:07.797
He left town about 20 years ago to join
the army. And he hasn't been back since.

08:07.888 --> 08:10.379
This guy got a battlefield commission
in Nam.

08:10.473 --> 08:12.881
Sometimes l think
you're crazier than Murdock.

08:12.976 --> 08:15.811
How are you gonna pass Face off
as a war hero...

08:15.896 --> 08:19.146
-in this guy's hometown?
-B.A., you got to have faith.

08:19.232 --> 08:22.435
lt's been 20 years.
People change, people forget.

08:23.361 --> 08:26.197
When you write this up,
you got to Iay it on pretty thick...

08:26.281 --> 08:29.282
about the returning hero.
And wire to Baker as soon as you can.

08:29.367 --> 08:33.235
When we get to town,
everybody's got to know who Joe Morgan is.

08:33.330 --> 08:37.162
B.A., you might as well start it up now.
This'll go like clockwork.

08:37.250 --> 08:40.951
You know, when Face turns on the charm,
he can do anything.

-Oh, yeah?

He's trying to make me mad.

He ain't got no harmonica there.
There's nothing but hot air.

Better put it away.
B.A. doesn't like music while he's driving.

on the plane tomorrow.

with you guys in the van.

Joe Morgan's homecoming would look...

09:32.138 --> 09:33.383

09:33.473 --> 09:36.143
Amy, you got married. That's wonderful.

09:36.226 --> 09:40.804
Now wait a minute, Hannibal.

There'll be a crowd
waving little flags and cheering you.

10:13.054 --> 10:17.847
Hannibal, one question here.
What happens if l win this election?

10:18.477 --> 10:22.059
You know, I can't be a sheriff.
Considering there's a price on my head...

10:22.147 --> 10:24.104

10:24.191 --> 10:27.026
