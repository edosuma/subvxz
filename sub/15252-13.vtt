WEBVTT

00:07.100 --> 00:08.000
Go back, go back.

00:09.200 --> 00:12.000
That is God and a surgeon
working in harmony.

00:12.000 --> 00:12.900
Here comes
the Schwarma girl.

00:15.600 --> 00:16.400
Hey.

00:16.400 --> 00:17.700
Hey...

00:18.100 --> 00:19.000
Here you guys go.

00:19.500 --> 00:21.200
Be careful, it's really hot.

00:21.200 --> 00:23.400
I don't want to... for you
to burn your tongue on it.

00:24.500 --> 00:27.500
Wow, 29 orders this month. 

00:28.200 --> 00:30.100
One more, and you'll get
a free baba ghanoush.

00:30.400 --> 00:31.100
Oh...

00:31.400 --> 00:33.400
I'm reaching in my pocket
for money, not for...

00:33.800 --> 00:34.800
Hey, do you
have change?

00:37.200 --> 00:38.700
Oh, she's...

00:38.700 --> 00:40.500
Did you get it?
Fellas...

00:40.500 --> 00:41.300
Oh, boy.

00:41.300 --> 00:43.300
What are you guys doing?

00:43.300 --> 00:45.100
Or have you forgotten
about Big Mike's pol

00:45.100 --> 00:46.900
on "Mammary cam"?

00:47.300 --> 00:49.600
I don't know what you're
talking about, Chuck.

00:49.600 --> 00:51.100
He doesn't know what I'm talking
about? That's so weird.

00:51.100 --> 00:53.600
So, you didn't actually just
remove the offending video

00:53.600 --> 00:55.500
from the camcorder and
then hand it to Lester,

00:55.500 --> 00:56.900
who is now hiding it 
behind his back?

00:56.900 --> 00:58.200
What? Wow!

00:58.200 --> 00:59.300
My feelings are hurt.

00:59.600 --> 01:00.900
Charles,
after all these years,

01:00.900 --> 01:02.500
where's the trust, my friend?

01:02.500 --> 01:04.099
In Jeff's sweaty palms,

01:04.099 --> 01:05.800
along with the amateur
consumer porn.

01:05.800 --> 01:07.000
Look...
No, you look...

01:07.000 --> 01:09.500
Hey, Chuck? Uh, can
I talk to you for a sec?

01:09.500 --> 01:10.800
Move.

01:10.800 --> 01:13.900
Awesome...
to see you, Devon.

01:13.900 --> 01:16.000
Yeah, yeah.
What's up?
All right.

01:16.000 --> 01:17.000
So, what's
on your mind?

01:17.000 --> 01:19.800
Chuck, I was, I was hoping
to talk to you about Ellie.

01:19.800 --> 01:22.000
Yeah?
Yeah, yeah, of course.

01:22.000 --> 01:24.000
Well, you know,
ever since, um,

01:24.600 --> 01:26.500
ever since we've been dating,
I've come to think of you 

01:26.500 --> 01:27.800
as that little brother
I never had.

01:28.500 --> 01:29.900
Don't you have
two younger brothers?

01:29.900 --> 01:31.700
Indeed. Indeed.

01:32.200 --> 01:35.000
But you seem like someone
who can offer sage wisdom 

01:35.000 --> 01:36.000
in confusing times,

01:36.000 --> 01:39.000
and this is one of those times
I am really confused, bro.

01:43.800 --> 01:46.100
I don't know how to put
this into words, really.

01:46.100 --> 01:47.200
That's a bug.

01:47.200 --> 01:48.500
What? What?

01:48.800 --> 01:50.700
Spider, I hate those
fuzzy little bastards...

01:50.700 --> 01:52.100
Oh, no. I think, uh, no,
you got him.

01:52.100 --> 01:53.800
He was like...
and then poof! Gone.

01:53.800 --> 01:55.100
Can you excuse me
for just one second?

01:55.100 --> 01:58.100
I think I just saw a kid
climbing into an oven
over in Home Appliances.

01:58.700 --> 01:59.500
Chuck!

02:00.100 --> 02:02.000
Chuck, I need you to drop
some knowledge, bro.

02:03.500 --> 02:05.700
Keep moving, Bartowksi.
Nothing to see here.

02:05.700 --> 02:06.900
Not even if I had the time.

02:08.699 --> 02:10.100
You're getting sloppy, Casey.

02:10.800 --> 02:12.600
I understand that you have
some perverse desire

02:12.600 --> 02:13.600
to listen to everybody,

02:13.600 --> 02:15.600
but you really need to be more
careful when hiding your bugs.

02:15.600 --> 02:17.200
What are you lip-smacking about,
Bartowski?

02:17.200 --> 02:20.000
I just found <i>this</i> on one
of our product displays,

02:20.000 --> 02:21.600
and not very well
hidden, I might add.

02:21.600 --> 02:23.700
Normally, I'm a fan
of your craftsmanship,

02:23.700 --> 02:24.700
if not your methods.

02:24.700 --> 02:27.000
Look, all I'm saying is that
something like this discovered

02:27.000 --> 02:29.000
by someone less in the know
than me could spell trouble.

02:29.000 --> 02:31.200
You worry about that
supercomputer in your brain.

02:31.200 --> 02:32.800
Let me worry
about the spy stuff, huh?

02:34.000 --> 02:35.600
Don't you have a hard drive
you can go fix?

02:39.400 --> 02:41.400
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
There's best buddy of mine.

02:41.400 --> 02:43.200
Yeah. What's up?

02:43.200 --> 02:45.000
Okay, saw an Infinity Ward
mail in the trash,

02:45.000 --> 02:48.100
and I'm guessing that means
you got a pre-release demo

02:48.100 --> 02:49.400
of the next <i>Call of Duty</i> game?

02:49.400 --> 02:52.600
Ah... Yeah, but the last time
I lent you a game sampler,

02:52.600 --> 02:54.200
it ended up
all over the Internet.

02:54.200 --> 02:55.600
So this one's gonna
stay in my locker,

02:55.600 --> 02:57.900
and you can play it when
you get some adult supervision.

02:57.900 --> 03:00.500
Adult super...?
Chuck, I'm almost at the age

03:00.500 --> 03:02.000
where I should get my prostate
checked annually.

03:02.000 --> 03:03.500
Okay? Surely I could be trusted
with an advance copy

03:03.500 --> 03:05.500
of the next greatest video game
on the planet.

03:06.600 --> 03:07.500
Have you seen Awesome?

03:08.600 --> 03:09.800
Over by the Home Theater Room.

03:09.800 --> 03:10.800
(muttering):
I think that's...

03:12.100 --> 03:13.000
...really.

03:16.000 --> 03:18.000
??

03:18.000 --> 03:19.500
???

03:19.500 --> 03:23.000
defrosting himself,
as it turns out.

03:23.000 --> 03:25.100
So, uh, what, uh,
what's going on?

03:25.700 --> 03:27.000
This is one of those
rare moments

03:27.000 --> 03:28.700
when things are not kosher,
Chuck.

03:31.000 --> 03:33.200
Oh, man.
This is harder than I thought.

03:34.000 --> 03:34.600
Uh-huh.

03:35.400 --> 03:36.700
Go... Go on.
I'm listening.

03:37.500 --> 03:38.200
Right. Well...

03:38.500 --> 03:40.700
I've been thinking a lot
about the way things are

03:40.700 --> 03:41.900
between me
and your sister.

03:42.400 --> 03:45.000
And you're the man in...
in Ellie's family,

03:45.700 --> 03:46.600
so I was wondering...

03:47.500 --> 03:48.700
Can I have your permission...

03:50.400 --> 03:51.700
Can I marry Ellie?

03:54.200 --> 03:57.400
Wow. That-That's quite...
quite a rock you got there.

03:58.100 --> 03:59.700
Is that a yes? Dude...

03:59.700 --> 04:00.600
Yes! Yes!

04:00.600 --> 04:02.300
Sorry! I just...

04:02.300 --> 04:04.500
You kind of--- waah!
You know, you pulled the blang

04:04.500 --> 04:06.300
just right in...
Yes, you have my blessing.

04:06.300 --> 04:07.800
Thank you. Thank you.

04:07.800 --> 04:09.200
I mean, it's been in my family
for years.

04:09.200 --> 04:10.300
This was my great-grandmother's.

04:11.700 --> 04:13.000
(chuckles)
Ah, you think she'll like it?

04:13.000 --> 04:14.800
Like it? She'll, she'll love it.

04:14.800 --> 04:16.100
I, um, I'm just not sure

04:16.100 --> 04:17.700
she'll be able to lift
her hand anymore.

04:18.000 --> 04:19.300
Oh, one other thing.

04:19.300 --> 04:21.899
Ellie is a bloodhound
when it comes to these
kind of things.

04:21.899 --> 04:24.100
If I keep this in the apartment,
she will smell diamond.

04:24.400 --> 04:26.400
Can you hold onto this,
just for a day or so, man?

04:26.400 --> 04:28.300
I mean, just till I figure out 
how to pop the question?

04:28.300 --> 04:30.400
I don't think it's actually
a good idea...
Oh, thank you!

04:30.700 --> 04:32.900
Thank you so much, bro.

04:32.900 --> 04:35.200
Hey, pretty soon, I'm going
to mean that literally.

04:35.200 --> 04:36.700
There you go.
All right...

04:38.000 --> 04:44.074
Advertise your product or brand here

04:54.600 --> 04:55.600
We have a problem.

04:55.600 --> 04:56.600
What do you mean?

04:57.500 --> 04:58.900
Chuck found that
in the Buy More.

05:00.700 --> 05:01.700
We have a problem.

05:02.200 --> 05:03.400
BECKMAN:
 <i>The bug Chuck found is</i>

05:03.400 --> 05:07.100
a GLG-20, one of the most
advanced counter-espionage

05:07.100 --> 05:09.300
listening devices
in the CIA arsenal.

05:09.300 --> 05:10.800
This is a CIA design?

05:10.800 --> 05:11.900
Figures.

05:11.900 --> 05:14.900
The GLG-20 is
a low-power transmitter.

05:14.900 --> 05:16.800
In order to avoid detection,

05:16.800 --> 05:19.100
it has a maximum range
of about 20 yards.

05:19.600 --> 05:21.600
Which means there's
probably a receiver

05:21.600 --> 05:23.400
hidden somewhere
inside the Buy More.

05:23.400 --> 05:24.800
GRAHAM:
We believe
it's recently become

05:24.800 --> 05:26.800
a favorite
of the FULCRUM agents.

05:27.600 --> 05:30.500
So, you're telling us the secret
government cabal that abducted

05:30.500 --> 05:32.500
Bryce Larkin and came
within a hair of figuring out

05:32.500 --> 05:34.200
that Chuck's the Intersect is

05:34.200 --> 05:36.200
now skulking
around the Buy More?

05:36.200 --> 05:38.100
We need you to locate
that receiver,

05:38.100 --> 05:40.400
and find the person
who planted it.

05:41.200 --> 05:42.600
BECKMAN:
 <i>You have 48 hours.</i>

05:43.400 --> 05:46.500
 <i>If you cannot identify the</i>
 <i>enemy operative in that time,</i>

05:47.100 --> 05:49.600
we will have no choice
but to relocate Chuck

05:49.600 --> 05:51.800
to a secure government
holding facility.

05:54.900 --> 05:58.900
GRAHAM:

06:48.600 --> 06:50.200
When are these young ladies
going to learn?

06:50.500 --> 06:51.900
If they don't want someone
taking a picture

06:51.900 --> 06:54.300
of their private business,
put some drawers on.

07:29.600 --> 07:31.600
Hey, uh, you think
we should make a run for it?

07:31.600 --> 07:33.100
You don't run
from the cops.

07:33.100 --> 07:35.200
It makes you look guilty,
or shot in the back.

07:35.200 --> 07:36.400
We are guilty.
Shh!

07:39.200 --> 07:41.500
Bring me down
and I will cut you.

07:41.500 --> 07:44.200
So, no locks broken?
No alarms set off?

07:44.200 --> 07:45.100
Nope. It's clean.

07:45.300 --> 07:47.800
Must be an inside job.
Thought of that.

07:47.800 --> 07:50.400
You really think any of these
dummies can mastermind all this?

07:50.400 --> 07:52.500
It's almost always someone
close to the operation.

07:52.500 --> 07:54.700
When I find out
who robbed my store

07:54.700 --> 07:55.900
and stole my fish,

07:56.400 --> 07:57.000
I'm gonna break

07:57.000 --> 07:58.100
my foot off
in his behind.

07:58.700 --> 07:59.400
(whispers):
Oh, my God...

07:59.400 --> 08:00.900
Shh!
Hi.

08:00.900 --> 08:02.700
Hey.

08:03.300 --> 08:05.400
What's with the police
presence outside?

08:05.400 --> 08:07.000
They robbed the Buy More, man.

08:07.000 --> 08:07.800
They took everything.

08:11.400 --> 08:13.200
They took everything?
Everything.

08:15.800 --> 08:17.000
Oh, please, God, no.

08:18.500 --> 08:20.200
Please be there.

08:20.200 --> 08:23.000
Oh, my God...

08:25.000 --> 08:26.500
The ring.

08:26.900 --> 08:28.100
They took Ellie's ring.

08:29.700 --> 08:30.600
Oh, my God.

08:33.600 --> 08:34.799
(panting):
Oh, oh...

08:34.799 --> 08:37.700
Oh! Oh!

08:38.100 --> 08:39.799
Hey...
Chuckles, what's up?

08:40.500 --> 08:43.799
Dude, I figured out
how I'm gonna pop the Q.

08:43.799 --> 08:46.200
The Q? What Q? What's a Q?

08:46.200 --> 08:49.400
You know, the Q, the big Q
you only ask once in a lifetime.

08:50.000 --> 08:52.900
Can't say right now... Mom.

08:53.500 --> 08:54.400
Is that your mom?

08:54.400 --> 08:55.400
Tell her
that I love that

08:55.400 --> 08:57.700
kittens-playing-with-the-yarn
sweater that she knitted me.

08:57.700 --> 08:59.200
You got it, babe.

09:01.600 --> 09:03.300
I'm going to do it
while we're skydiving.

09:03.300 --> 09:05.500
Really?
Do you think, uh...

09:05.500 --> 09:06.500
Do you think
that's a good idea?

09:06.500 --> 09:09.300
Not the first time we've been
in the mile-high club, buddy.

09:09.300 --> 09:10.100
If you know what I mean.

09:10.100 --> 09:11.100
Yeah, uh...

09:11.100 --> 09:14.500
Listen: skydiving is a little,
it's a little risky.

09:14.500 --> 09:16.300
Don't you think? I mean,
you could drop the ring.

09:16.300 --> 09:17.800
Whoa. Hot call, dude.

09:17.800 --> 09:19.600
Hate to lose
my great-granny's ring.

09:19.600 --> 09:21.900
She gave it to me
right before she passed.

09:21.900 --> 09:25.000
You know? She knew Ellie was
the one before I did.

09:25.000 --> 09:26.400
Great, great, okay, so...

09:26.400 --> 09:28.000
just, you know, let me know

09:28.000 --> 09:29.700
when you figure
something else out.
Okay.

09:29.700 --> 09:31.300
But, Devon, um...

09:34.100 --> 09:34.900
take your time.

09:34.900 --> 09:35.900
You got it, brother.

09:41.000 --> 09:42.500
(thuds)
Oh...

09:46.000 --> 09:47.000
Detective Conway here

09:47.600 --> 09:49.600
is convinced
that this is an inside job.

09:50.200 --> 09:52.200
And we intend to get
to the bottom of this.

09:52.900 --> 09:54.000
Bartowski, get over here.

09:55.000 --> 09:56.300
You're a suspect, too.

09:56.800 --> 09:57.800
You all are!

09:59.100 --> 10:00.600
When that pig
talks to you,

10:00.600 --> 10:02.800
look him in the eye
and say nothing.

10:02.800 --> 10:04.100
Zip it.

10:04.100 --> 10:06.500
Nothing? Come on, that's
incredibly rude, Jeffrey.

10:06.800 --> 10:09.200
Dead men tell
no tales.

10:09.200 --> 10:10.800
Stop it.
Quit messing around.

10:11.800 --> 10:12.800
Bartowski, where's Casey?

10:12.800 --> 10:14.900
Don't you two usually
carpool together?

10:14.900 --> 10:17.100
Yes.
Yes, sir, we absolutely do.

10:17.100 --> 10:20.200
But, uh... not today.

10:20.800 --> 10:23.600
Why don't you go find out
why his ass is so tardy.

10:23.600 --> 10:25.700
Someone might
find that suspicious.

10:25.700 --> 10:27.600
Sure, I can-I can do that.

10:33.700 --> 10:34.700
CASEY:
What?

10:34.700 --> 10:36.100
Where are you?
Big Mike's looking for you.

10:36.100 --> 10:37.500
Yeah, well, he's going to be
looking for both of us.

10:37.500 --> 10:38.900
Now get down here, we need you.

10:38.900 --> 10:40.000
No, no, no, no.
Listen to me.

10:40.000 --> 10:40.700
I need you, okay?

10:40.700 --> 10:42.200
Someone cleaned out the Buy More
last night.

10:42.200 --> 10:44.200
They took everything;
they took my sister's ring,

10:44.200 --> 10:45.400
the one she's supposed
to wear forever,

10:45.400 --> 10:46.400
even though she doesn't
know it yet.

10:46.400 --> 10:48.200
Awesome is supposed
to propose to her,

10:48.200 --> 10:49.500
he trusted me
and now it's gone.

10:49.800 --> 10:51.800
Save it for your coffee
klatch, Bartowski.

10:51.800 --> 10:53.500
Get down here.
We got bigger fish to fry.

11:15.900 --> 11:17.200
You robbed the Buy More?

11:21.700 --> 11:23.000
SARAH:
We had no choice, Chuck.

11:23.000 --> 11:24.600
CHUCK:
No choice? Are you
out of your mind?

11:24.600 --> 11:26.500
Do you have any idea
what's going on at
the store right now?

11:26.500 --> 11:28.500
That bug you found,
it isn't one of ours.

11:28.800 --> 11:30.100
What bug?
Who, ours?

11:30.100 --> 11:31.300
SARAH:
The one you found yesterday.

11:31.700 --> 11:33.700
Casey only installed EM-50s.

11:33.700 --> 11:35.700
The one you found was a GLG-20.

11:35.700 --> 11:37.900
It requires a secondary
recording device nearby

11:37.900 --> 11:38.900
to collect the data.

11:38.900 --> 11:39.700
What are you talking about?

11:39.700 --> 11:41.500
Someone is spying on us.

11:42.500 --> 11:43.300
What?!

11:43.300 --> 11:44.100
Okay, listen carefully--

11:44.100 --> 11:45.700
the bug you found was not ours.

11:45.700 --> 11:47.700
It belongs to an enemy agent,
probably Fulcrum,

11:47.700 --> 11:49.200
and they planted it
in the Buy More.

11:49.200 --> 11:51.100
Why?
Looking for
the Intersect.

11:52.300 --> 11:53.300
They're looking for you.

11:54.000 --> 11:56.100
We found a total of
29 bugs just like it,

11:57.000 --> 11:58.100
but we still haven't
found the receiver.

11:58.100 --> 11:58.900
CHUCK:
Okay.

11:58.900 --> 12:01.500
Okay, well, wow.

12:01.500 --> 12:04.100
Uh, extreme...
extreme measures,

12:04.100 --> 12:05.700
but, uh, decisive action

12:05.700 --> 12:06.400
had to be taken.

12:07.800 --> 12:09.900
Good luck schlepping all this
stuff back to the Buy More.

12:09.900 --> 12:11.600
Uh, I'm going to get
back there right now

12:11.600 --> 12:12.900
and pretend like I
don't know anything.

12:12.900 --> 12:14.600
Got any good tips
for beating a polygraph?

12:15.500 --> 12:16.300
Chuck, wait.

12:16.300 --> 12:18.000
What? Ch...?

12:18.000 --> 12:19.000
Oh, duh, yeah... 
(chuckles)

12:19.800 --> 12:21.100
Can I get my
sister's ring back?

12:21.100 --> 12:22.100
You guys are pretty
damn thorough.

12:23.800 --> 12:25.500
You should be more concerned
about not making it

12:25.500 --> 12:26.800
to her wedding.
Can I talk to you for a second?

12:26.800 --> 12:27.900
Hold on.

12:30.300 --> 12:32.800
He can't hear it like that.
He won't process it.

12:34.000 --> 12:35.700
How do you give a man
a life sentence

12:35.700 --> 12:36.700
just for being
a good guy?

12:37.100 --> 12:39.300
Okay, how about I
give it a try, gently?

12:39.300 --> 12:41.100
No, I don't want to hear
your version of it

12:41.100 --> 12:42.900
and neither does he.
It's a job.

12:43.100 --> 12:45.000
How come you always
got to get your lady
feelings involved...?

12:45.000 --> 12:46.500
It has nothing to do...
Agent Walker, Major Casey.

12:46.500 --> 12:47.900
You might want to take
a look at this.

12:52.400 --> 12:53.700
This is a surveillance tape

12:53.700 --> 12:54.800
taken during
the robbery.

12:56.300 --> 12:57.200
CASEY:
There's nothing there.

12:57.200 --> 12:59.100
Bad guy disabled
the security system.
Wait.

13:00.700 --> 13:02.000
CHUCK:
Hey, that's Jeff and Lester.

13:02.000 --> 13:04.800
And they are apparently drunk.

13:05.500 --> 13:07.600
 It appears they've mistakenly
turned the camera back on.

13:10.000 --> 13:11.300
Hang on a second--
who's that?

13:11.500 --> 13:12.500
SARAH:
That's the spy.

13:13.200 --> 13:14.800
He's the spy who
spies on spies.

13:15.200 --> 13:17.500
CHUCK:
Why would a Fulcrum agent
try to steal Big Mike's fish?

13:19.300 --> 13:21.500
CASEY:
Those two dilweeds
interrupted an actual

13:21.500 --> 13:22.300
robbery in progress.

13:22.300 --> 13:23.600
The receiver's in the fish.

13:23.900 --> 13:25.100
 Marlin, actually.
Technically,
it's a marlin.

13:25.100 --> 13:27.200
Marlin.
You would call it a
marlin, right? Yeah.

13:27.200 --> 13:27.800
Look.

13:30.600 --> 13:32.300
See, there you go-- done.

13:32.300 --> 13:33.400
My job here is done.

13:33.400 --> 13:35.500
So now I'm sure you
super-agents can figure out

13:35.500 --> 13:36.700
where the two
drunken pinheads

13:36.700 --> 13:38.800
stashed the fish-- marlin,
four-foot marlin.

13:38.800 --> 13:40.300
I'm going to stick
around here and try

13:40.300 --> 13:41.200
and find my
sister's ring.

13:42.100 --> 13:42.800
Hey, Chuck?

13:43.900 --> 13:46.300
Chuck, no ring came up
in our inventory.

13:47.500 --> 13:50.100
What do you mean no ring
came up in your inventory?

13:50.100 --> 13:51.400
You guys robbed the Buy More,
didn't you?

13:51.400 --> 13:52.900
What happened to Awesome's
great-grandmother's ring?

13:52.900 --> 13:55.300
We kind of have some bigger-
picture concerns right now.

13:55.300 --> 13:58.300
What could be possibly be bigger
than me ruining the chances

13:58.300 --> 13:59.300
of my sister
getting married?

14:00.800 --> 14:02.700
The receiver
may contain information

14:02.700 --> 14:04.900
indicating that
you're the Intersect.

14:09.200 --> 14:10.000
Say it.

14:10.800 --> 14:11.800
Say what you're not saying.

14:13.800 --> 14:17.000
If we don't locate the receiver
in the next 24 hours...

14:18.100 --> 14:20.200
You'll be stored in an
underground bunker for so long

14:20.200 --> 14:21.700
you'll forget what fresh air
smells like.

14:32.200 --> 14:34.100
LESTER & JEFFREY:
One, two, three, four.

14:34.400 --> 14:36.700
I declare a thumb war!

14:42.000 --> 14:43.800
Oh! Come on,
Jeffrey.

14:43.800 --> 14:45.700
Jeff, Lester, we got
to talk, it's important.

14:45.700 --> 14:47.400
Yeah, see, this is
your problem, Charlie.

14:47.400 --> 14:49.100
Why is your time
more valuable than mine? 

14:49.100 --> 14:51.200
Oh! He is taking
him over the top!

14:51.200 --> 14:52.700
All right.
Ow! My thumb!

14:52.700 --> 14:54.900
Hey. Let's go.

14:55.600 --> 14:57.500
(fake coughing):
Narc. Narc, Narc. Narc. Narc.

14:59.400 --> 15:01.100
JEFFREY:
Easy on the shirt, Narc.

15:01.100 --> 15:02.200
Where's the fish?

15:02.700 --> 15:04.000
Fish? What fish?

15:04.000 --> 15:06.300
Okay, we can do this
the easy way or the hard way.

15:06.300 --> 15:08.400
Easy way is I shove
his foot up your ass.

15:08.400 --> 15:09.800
What's the hard way?

15:09.800 --> 15:11.100
I use my foot.

15:11.900 --> 15:13.600
 CHUCK:
Look, we've seen the
surveillance footage, guys.

15:13.600 --> 15:15.400
Okay? We know you were here
last night.

15:15.400 --> 15:17.500
Yeah, right.
Yeah, no,
you two geniuses

15:17.500 --> 15:18.900
thought you were
turning the cameras off,

15:18.900 --> 15:20.800
but, instead,
you turned them back on.

15:21.800 --> 15:23.900
We won't say anything
to Big Mike, I promise.

15:28.700 --> 15:30.000
 Okay.

15:33.500 --> 15:34.700
Come on, wh-what's
happening?

15:34.700 --> 15:37.000
Charles, would you give us
a few minutes, please?

15:37.800 --> 15:38.800
Chuck...?

15:41.400 --> 15:43.100
It was his idea.
What?!

15:43.700 --> 15:46.000
The whole reason we snuck in
was to get your alcoholic ass

15:46.000 --> 15:47.400
another drink-- you
were getting the shakes.

15:47.400 --> 15:49.200
Not cool.
It's a disease.

15:49.200 --> 15:51.000
You're a disease,
and you've diseased us all--

15:51.000 --> 15:51.900
me, Chuck, this guy.

15:51.900 --> 15:54.000
C-Calm down. Calm down.
Okay.

15:54.000 --> 15:55.700
Look, Jeff, I totally

15:55.700 --> 15:57.300
understand your plight.

15:57.300 --> 15:59.600
We sympathize
with you, okay?

15:59.600 --> 16:00.500
And we don't judge.

16:00.500 --> 16:01.100
Just tell us

16:01.100 --> 16:02.500
what exactly happened?

16:03.100 --> 16:05.200
We were across
the street at Bennigan's

16:05.200 --> 16:07.300
and I got
cut off again...
Jeff.

16:08.500 --> 16:09.900
If you're going
to tell the story,

16:09.900 --> 16:12.200
please...
don't butcher it.

16:14.300 --> 16:17.200
We were at Benni's, enjoying
the deep-fried sampler,

16:17.300 --> 16:19.200
 <i>and we decided</i>
 <i>to come back to the store</i>

16:19.200 --> 16:22.100
 <i>for a nightcap in boss man's</i>
 <i>private stash.</i>

16:22.300 --> 16:23.300
It's off.
(groans)

16:23.300 --> 16:24.900
Rock and roll.

16:25.100 --> 16:27.000
We have the store
to ourselves.

16:27.000 --> 16:29.100
We should take off
all our clothes.

16:29.100 --> 16:30.900
Don't make me uncomfortable
to be alone with you.

16:35.100 --> 16:35.700
 Go get it.

16:35.700 --> 16:37.000
Bingo.

16:37.000 --> 16:38.000
Yes.
No.

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
No, no, no.

16:40.000 --> 16:42.900
Jeffrey!
It's a wasted mission now.

16:42.900 --> 16:43.900
It's a wasted mission.

16:44.700 --> 16:46.500
We've gotta do something
exciting while we're here, man.

16:46.500 --> 16:48.900
We can burn it down.

16:50.200 --> 16:51.700
I was thinking more along
the lines of a...

16:53.000 --> 16:54.200
fishing expedition.

16:58.000 --> 16:59.200
And that, friends...

17:00.500 --> 17:02.400
is the story
of the missing marlin.

17:02.400 --> 17:03.900
And where is the marlin now?

17:03.900 --> 17:07.599
I'm afraid I'm going to need
a little compensation.

17:07.599 --> 17:09.400
(cries out)

17:09.400 --> 17:11.200
At Chuck's!
We took it to Chuck's pad!

17:11.200 --> 17:12.400
What? My apartment? Why?

17:12.400 --> 17:14.400
We didn't want to get busted
with Big Mike's fish.

17:15.900 --> 17:17.099
LESTER:
I'm going to
need lotion.

17:18.900 --> 17:20.000
SARAH:
We're pursuing the receiver.

17:20.000 --> 17:21.000
We've got the location,

17:21.000 --> 17:22.700
and it shouldn't be long
before recovery.

17:23.000 --> 17:24.300
Stay with the receiver.

17:24.300 --> 17:26.000
In the meantime we've decided

17:26.000 --> 17:27.300
to extract Chuck.

17:27.300 --> 17:29.500
What? But we don't know
he's in danger.

17:29.500 --> 17:32.000
There's a chance
the identity of the Intersect

17:32.000 --> 17:33.000
has been compromised.

17:33.000 --> 17:34.800
We have to err
on the side of caution.

17:34.800 --> 17:37.200
You promised we had 48 hours.

17:37.700 --> 17:38.900
You know the game, Agent Walker.

17:39.100 --> 17:40.800
The order has gone out.

17:40.800 --> 17:42.500
Chuck is coming in.

17:53.000 --> 17:54.400
Come on.

17:54.800 --> 17:56.000
Chuck, you're looking
for a marlin.

18:01.000 --> 18:02.100
Hey, hey, whoa.

18:02.100 --> 18:03.700
Whoa, stop, stop.
I seriously doubt

18:03.700 --> 18:04.800
that these geniuses
had time

18:04.800 --> 18:05.800
to reupholster the couch.

18:06.400 --> 18:07.900
It's got to be here somewhere.

18:10.000 --> 18:11.600
Chuck?

18:12.800 --> 18:13.500
Hey, sis.

18:14.200 --> 18:15.000
John.

18:15.000 --> 18:15.900
Hi.

18:15.900 --> 18:17.100
What are you two up to?

18:18.100 --> 18:19.200
What's going on
with the apartment?

18:19.200 --> 18:20.800
I'll clean it up later.
Right now, we're
looking for something.

18:20.800 --> 18:23.500
What is it?
Look, I-I promise you

18:23.500 --> 18:25.100
whatever you want to talk
about is not as important

18:25.100 --> 18:27.600
as what we're looking
for right now.
Okay.

18:27.600 --> 18:28.700
What are you looking for?

18:31.900 --> 18:32.800
A stuffed fish.

18:33.300 --> 18:34.000
A fish?

18:34.000 --> 18:35.700
Marlin, actually,
about four feet long.

18:35.700 --> 18:38.200
Got a spear-like nose.
And a mouth. Yeah.

18:38.900 --> 18:40.000
Okay, Chuck, I get it.

18:40.200 --> 18:42.300
 Besides, if anything
 <i>really</i> important

18:42.300 --> 18:44.500
were going on,
you have plenty of people

18:44.500 --> 18:45.700
in your life you can
talk to about it.

18:45.700 --> 18:46.800
Hey, Ellie, wait.

18:46.800 --> 18:47.500
What?

18:47.900 --> 18:49.300
Oh!

18:49.300 --> 18:50.700
I love you.

18:51.600 --> 18:52.500
Just in case.

18:53.000 --> 18:54.000
Just in case of what?

18:56.600 --> 18:57.400
Uh....

18:57.900 --> 19:00.100
Just-just in case
I can't find the fish.

19:02.700 --> 19:04.300
I suppose you haven't
talked to Morgan.

19:05.300 --> 19:06.700
No. Why?

19:07.400 --> 19:11.100
Because he left here last night
with a four-foot long marlin.

19:13.300 --> 19:14.600
He's mine.

19:21.000 --> 19:23.100
And you know nothing about
the stolen merchandise?

19:23.100 --> 19:25.100
No, sir. Officer. Detective.

19:25.100 --> 19:26.600
Where's my fish, Grimes?

19:26.600 --> 19:27.700
Mr. Tucker, please.

19:27.700 --> 19:29.200
The merchandise is insured.

19:29.200 --> 19:31.900
That fish cost me 200 bucks
on eBay.

19:31.900 --> 19:33.800
Wait, you bought that fish?

19:35.000 --> 19:36.000
That will be
all, Mr. Grimes.

19:36.000 --> 19:38.100
What did you use
for bait, PayPal?

19:38.100 --> 19:38.900
CONWAY:
Grimes, out!

19:38.900 --> 19:39.600
All right. Yes, sir.

19:43.400 --> 19:44.500
You cracked,
didn't you?

19:44.500 --> 19:45.400
LESTER:
You are so weak.

19:45.400 --> 19:46.600
JEFFREY:
You are so weak, man.

19:46.600 --> 19:48.500
How am I weak, dude?
I didn't say anything.

19:48.500 --> 19:49.400
In fact, I told...
How am I supposed
to believe that?

19:49.400 --> 19:51.100
Bartowski! You're up.

19:51.100 --> 19:53.100
I got the scraggly troll.

19:59.500 --> 20:01.500
I-I did not rob the store.

20:02.300 --> 20:03.400
Did I ask you that?

20:03.400 --> 20:05.600
Already he's talking
about stolen goods.

20:05.600 --> 20:07.600
You might as well come out
and admit you did it.
Please.

20:07.600 --> 20:08.800
Let me handle
the investigation.

20:10.200 --> 20:11.900
Now, Mr. Bartowski,

20:12.700 --> 20:14.300
we believe
this was an inside job.

20:14.300 --> 20:16.500
None of these other imbeciles
could even tie their shoes

20:16.500 --> 20:17.600
without Bartowski's say-so.

20:17.600 --> 20:19.600
If there's a ringleader,
you're looking at him.

20:19.600 --> 20:21.400
Where's my fish, Bartowski?!

20:23.300 --> 20:24.300
Okay, start talking.

20:24.600 --> 20:25.600
From the beginning.

20:25.600 --> 20:27.000
Okay.

20:27.000 --> 20:29.100
Um... I was born
a Cesarean section.

20:29.100 --> 20:30.300
And I always felt
like I was robbed

20:30.300 --> 20:32.200
of that headlong voyage
through the uterine canal.

20:32.200 --> 20:33.600
Where's the marlin, moron?

20:34.300 --> 20:36.400
Ah, the elusive fish. Sure.

20:36.400 --> 20:38.200
That's a tale for the ages.

20:38.200 --> 20:40.400
Start talking or I'll pull
each and every one

20:40.400 --> 20:42.400
of these hairs out of
your face, one at a time,

20:42.400 --> 20:44.100
starting with this one.
(groans)

20:45.000 --> 20:46.100
Torture?

20:46.100 --> 20:47.800
Hey, if you're trying
to get me to talk,

20:47.800 --> 20:49.800
you are using
the wrong tactic, brother.

20:50.100 --> 20:50.900
Really?

20:51.100 --> 20:52.300
What's the right tactic?

20:53.000 --> 20:54.600
My own personal kryptonite:

20:55.200 --> 20:56.200
Grape soda.

20:57.800 --> 20:58.700
On the rocks, please.

21:00.700 --> 21:02.200
Conway.

21:03.300 --> 21:04.600
Excuse me, I have
to take this.

21:04.600 --> 21:05.800
I got this.

21:05.800 --> 21:06.500
Ah.

21:11.200 --> 21:12.500
You don't want to talk,
Bartowski?

21:14.000 --> 21:15.700
We'll just have to turn the heat
up on you.

21:30.700 --> 21:32.900
Mm-hmm.

21:34.400 --> 21:35.800
There we go.

21:37.600 --> 21:38.900
Ah. Proper.

21:40.500 --> 21:42.400
So, it all started with
"The Next Call of Duty" game...

21:47.600 --> 21:49.200
 <i>Now, I don't really</i>
 <i>consider it stealing,</i>

21:49.200 --> 21:51.300
 <i>since I see Chuck and I</i>
 <i>as being life partners</i>

21:51.300 --> 21:53.300
 <i>and therefore,</i>
 <i>community property.</i>

21:55.100 --> 21:56.600
 <i>Using my own personal entrance,</i>

21:57.600 --> 21:59.900
 <i>I went into Chuck's room</i>
 <i>to play the game.</i>

22:01.800 --> 22:02.800
Yessss!

22:04.400 --> 22:06.400
 <i>And when I reached</i>
 <i>into the bag, I discovered a...</i>

22:08.100 --> 22:08.900
 <i>I found a, uh...</i>

22:09.700 --> 22:10.900
I can't go on.

22:11.800 --> 22:14.000
This is just getting
a little personal.

22:14.000 --> 22:15.000
All right, new tactic:

22:15.000 --> 22:17.100
You finish the story
or I put your head
through the wall.

22:19.100 --> 22:20.800
Okay, someone wasn't hugged
enough as a child.

22:20.800 --> 22:21.900
Ugh.

22:22.300 --> 22:23.400
That's horrible.

22:23.400 --> 22:25.400
It's better on the rocks,
that's why I told you to...

22:25.400 --> 22:27.000
Anyway, there I was...

22:27.600 --> 22:30.200
 <i>staring at the most horrific</i>
 <i>object the world has ever seen.</i>

22:30.200 --> 22:32.100
Noooooo!

22:32.400 --> 22:33.100
What?

22:33.700 --> 22:35.900
Morgan, you scared me

22:35.900 --> 22:37.100
to death!
What is wrong with you?

22:37.100 --> 22:38.100
No, no,

22:38.100 --> 22:39.900
no, no, no...
no, it's Chuck.

22:39.900 --> 22:41.100
Well, what is it?
What happened?

22:41.100 --> 22:42.000
We've lost him, Ell.

22:42.000 --> 22:43.500
We've lost him
forever.

22:44.900 --> 22:46.400
You better sit down.

22:46.900 --> 22:48.300
Um...

22:49.900 --> 22:51.000
I don't know how
to say this.

22:52.500 --> 22:53.300
He's gone.

22:54.900 --> 22:56.000
Morgan, what are you
talking about?

22:56.800 --> 22:58.200
I'm talking about this.

22:59.600 --> 23:01.400
Chuck's going to
propose to Sarah.

23:02.600 --> 23:03.900
 <i>And that's pretty much</i>
 <i>the whole story.</i>

23:04.700 --> 23:05.500
More or less.

23:05.500 --> 23:07.200
Ellie and I bonded
over the fact that,

23:07.200 --> 23:09.500
you know, he didn't include us
in this life decision.

23:10.500 --> 23:13.000
But, hey, who cares, you know,
he's got you now, so...

23:13.500 --> 23:14.900
What does that have
to do with the fish?

23:14.900 --> 23:17.200
F-Fish? Who cares
about the fish?

23:17.200 --> 23:18.700
John, Chuck's getting married!

23:20.100 --> 23:21.300
Pitas are here.

23:22.000 --> 23:22.800
Hey.
Hey.

23:27.200 --> 23:28.500
You've had 29 deliveries,

23:28.500 --> 23:30.200
so I dropped in
your free baba ganoush.

23:30.200 --> 23:31.000
Really?
29 deliveries.
Uh-huh.

23:31.000 --> 23:33.800
29 bugs.

23:36.800 --> 23:38.000
Wait a second.

23:52.500 --> 23:53.500
Oh, lunch!

23:56.700 --> 23:57.600
Thank you.

23:57.600 --> 23:58.200
Ooh!

23:58.200 --> 24:00.200
Hey, buddy.
I-I smell falafel.

24:00.200 --> 24:01.300
Yeah, of course
you do.

24:11.600 --> 24:14.100
What do you got?
I got the chick...

24:14.100 --> 24:15.700
I'm just going to,
let me just have a...
No, no.

24:15.700 --> 24:17.000
You're going to
finish the story.

24:17.000 --> 24:18.300
Back to the story.

24:26.500 --> 24:27.500
Ooh!

24:35.700 --> 24:37.000
Come on.

24:39.600 --> 24:40.500
"Boobies."

24:41.500 --> 24:42.400
Jackpot.

25:01.000 --> 25:02.000
Gotcha!

25:02.600 --> 25:04.200
Good thing Jeff
and Lester are pervs.

25:21.200 --> 25:22.300
I can see you're sweating it.

25:22.900 --> 25:23.700
So...

25:24.600 --> 25:26.400
you ready to tell us what
happened here last night?

25:26.600 --> 25:28.600
 I'm telling you guys,
I have no idea.

25:28.600 --> 25:29.300
Fine.

25:30.100 --> 25:31.400
There's other ways
to make you talk.

25:32.500 --> 25:35.100
Time to send you back
to gen pop.

25:37.000 --> 25:38.900
He sung like a canary!

25:39.200 --> 25:40.300
Thanks for the
info, Chuck.

25:40.300 --> 25:42.100
John Casey! You're next!

25:42.400 --> 25:43.400
One sec.

25:43.400 --> 25:44.600
What? Can't fit the police

25:44.600 --> 25:45.700
into your social schedule?

25:45.700 --> 25:46.700
Get in here now,

25:47.100 --> 25:48.800
or you and I are taking
a trip downtown!

25:50.200 --> 25:51.400
If you have a second,
Mr. Casey,

25:51.400 --> 25:52.800
we'd appreciate it.

25:57.000 --> 25:58.200
LESTER:
I can't believe
you told Casey

25:58.200 --> 25:59.200
you put the marlin
in Chuck's room.

25:59.200 --> 26:00.400
What?

26:00.400 --> 26:01.900
Don't worry.
I moved it

26:01.900 --> 26:03.500
into the freezer at
the Wienerlicious.

26:04.000 --> 26:05.800
Wow, I'm impressed
with you.

26:05.800 --> 26:06.800
Thank you.
Bye.

26:06.800 --> 26:08.100
What? Where you going?

26:08.100 --> 26:09.800
Where you going? Where
you going, Lizzie?

26:09.800 --> 26:11.400
Lizzie? Where's she going?

26:20.600 --> 26:22.200
Can I help you?
Yeah.

26:22.600 --> 26:23.400
I was wondering

26:23.400 --> 26:24.800
if I could get something
out of your freezer.

26:24.800 --> 26:27.400
Oh, uh, I'm sorry.

26:27.400 --> 26:29.000
It's company policy.

26:29.000 --> 26:32.000
The kitchen is usually off-
limits for non-employees.

26:32.000 --> 26:34.500
Okay, then I'll have to use
my special pass...

26:37.800 --> 26:39.200
You're no hot dog maker.

26:39.900 --> 26:41.200
Bring it on, pita girl.

27:07.400 --> 27:08.600
We're closed!
We're closed!

27:16.100 --> 27:17.000
Where's the fish?

27:20.500 --> 27:21.800
We need to talk.
It's an emergency.

27:21.800 --> 27:23.100
Oh, listen, no, hey,

27:23.100 --> 27:24.700
hey, hey, Chuck, Chuck,
it's okay, man, I know

27:24.700 --> 27:25.800
about you and Sarah.

27:26.800 --> 27:28.300
Man, and how she's more
than just your girlfriend.

27:30.800 --> 27:31.800
What?

27:34.000 --> 27:35.800
Morgan, stay.

27:35.800 --> 27:37.100
But I...
Sta... stay!

27:39.100 --> 27:39.900
Hello.

27:40.000 --> 27:42.600
After careful consideration
of all potential proposals,

27:42.600 --> 27:44.000
I have made a decision.

27:44.000 --> 27:45.700
Oh, let me guess: Naked 2K run?

27:45.700 --> 27:47.100
Dinner, Chuck.

27:47.100 --> 27:48.200
Romantic, candlelit dinner,

27:48.200 --> 27:49.100
just the two of us.

27:49.100 --> 27:51.600
The coup de gr鈉e...
Wow. Good.

27:51.600 --> 27:53.300
molten lava cake with a
two-carat diamond ring filling.

27:53.900 --> 27:55.000
Ellie will really
love that.

27:56.600 --> 27:58.000
Look, Devon,
just-just promise me

27:58.000 --> 27:59.200
that you'll take care
of my sister

27:59.200 --> 28:00.700
if anything were to happen.

28:00.700 --> 28:01.600
What's gonna happen?

28:02.500 --> 28:03.500
Oh, hey,

28:03.500 --> 28:05.100
cake hits the oven in two hours.
Don't be late.

28:07.500 --> 28:08.400
What am I gonna do?

28:09.100 --> 28:09.900
Do nothing.

28:09.900 --> 28:11.700
You haven't given Sarah
the ring yet.

28:11.700 --> 28:13.200
Dude, there's plenty of time
to call this whole thing off.

28:14.500 --> 28:15.500
Sarah? Ring?

28:15.500 --> 28:16.800
Yeah, the ring
you got Sarah.

28:16.800 --> 28:18.100
The one I kind of took
out of your locker.

28:18.100 --> 28:19.800
You mean...

28:19.800 --> 28:22.900
the ring that Awesome
got for Ellie.

28:22.900 --> 28:25.100
Oh, thank God, man.
Are you kidding?

28:25.100 --> 28:26.200
I thought I lost you, pal!

28:26.200 --> 28:29.100
Morgan... where is the ring?

28:29.100 --> 28:30.700
It's kind of
complicated but...

28:30.700 --> 28:32.800
It's in the freezer
at the Wienerlicious.

28:32.800 --> 28:34.000
I put it in
Big Mike's marlin and I...

28:34.000 --> 28:34.800
I was gonna put it back.

28:36.400 --> 28:37.200
Ow!

28:38.700 --> 28:39.800
Slide it to me.

28:39.800 --> 28:41.400
Now!

28:45.000 --> 28:46.500
Hey!

28:51.800 --> 28:52.900
Hi, S...

28:55.500 --> 28:56.900
No...

28:56.900 --> 28:57.600
No, no!

28:57.600 --> 28:59.000
No, no, no, no, no.

28:59.000 --> 29:01.500
No, no, no, no, no, no!

29:01.500 --> 29:04.300
(distant):
Help!

29:05.500 --> 29:06.800
Sarah?

29:07.300 --> 29:09.100
Lizzie's the mole.
She got the receiver, Chuck.

29:09.100 --> 29:10.900
Oh, my God, Sarah, it's over.
They're gonna stick me

29:10.900 --> 29:11.900
in some tiny cell
with no windows.

29:11.900 --> 29:13.200
Okay, Chuck,
I need you to focus.

29:13.200 --> 29:15.200
We can get Lizzie
if you can get me out of here.

29:15.200 --> 29:16.200
How?

29:16.200 --> 29:17.700
I keep a backup piece

29:17.700 --> 29:19.600
in the jar of horseradish sauce.

29:19.600 --> 29:21.100
Horseradish?

29:21.600 --> 29:23.100
Who-Who-Who puts horseradish
on hot dogs?

29:23.100 --> 29:24.200
Chuck!
Got it. Right.

29:24.200 --> 29:25.500
Hide it someplace nobody
would look-- good.

29:25.500 --> 29:26.600
Great. Okay.

29:29.000 --> 29:31.500
Oh! Whoa.

29:32.900 --> 29:34.300
I got it. Okay.

29:34.300 --> 29:35.700
Okay, now shoot
the lock.

29:35.700 --> 29:38.400
Um, look, Sarah,

29:38.400 --> 29:39.600
I've never really fired
a gun before, okay?

29:39.600 --> 29:40.800
And I've actually
done this on purpose

29:40.800 --> 29:42.200
to avoid any unpleasant
side effects

29:42.200 --> 29:43.200
like shooting myself
or others.

29:43.600 --> 29:45.300
Just shoot the lock

29:45.300 --> 29:47.400
or I will shoot you
when I get out of here!

29:48.600 --> 29:49.500
(gasping):
Okay.

29:50.100 --> 29:51.500
Get back. Ready?
Ready? Get back.

29:51.500 --> 29:52.300
One...

29:52.900 --> 29:54.100
Two...

29:59.000 --> 30:00.400
Take the safety
off first.

30:03.700 --> 30:05.200
One, one sec...
just a little problem.

30:05.200 --> 30:07.500
CONWAY:
Bartowski, Big Mike told me
I'd find you here.

30:08.200 --> 30:09.600
Drop the gun, Bartowski!
Now!

30:09.600 --> 30:10.900
No, no, no,
no need to shoot.

30:10.900 --> 30:12.600
It's not my gun, it's not
my gun-- my girlfriend

30:12.600 --> 30:14.200
is locked in the freezer,
and if you let her out

30:14.200 --> 30:15.600
she can explain
everything.
Okay, let's go.

30:15.600 --> 30:17.500
She's right...
Come on, move.

30:17.500 --> 30:18.100
Okay, okay.

30:18.100 --> 30:19.200
Just look in...
Nice try.

30:19.200 --> 30:20.500
Go, go, go!
Look in the freezer, please!

30:20.500 --> 30:21.800
Just look in the freezer.
She's right there.

30:21.800 --> 30:23.500
You're taking this thing
a little seriously.

30:23.500 --> 30:24.800
What kind of
cop are you?

30:30.100 --> 30:31.300
Where's Big Mike's fish?

30:31.300 --> 30:32.700
What are you now, huh?

30:32.700 --> 30:34.200
Big Man's personal Gestapo?

30:34.200 --> 30:35.700
Come on, you can't
break me, fool.

30:36.700 --> 30:37.800
At the Wienerlicious.

30:48.800 --> 30:49.600
SARAH:
Help!

30:55.300 --> 30:57.100
Sarah.

30:57.100 --> 30:58.400
Stand back.

31:02.000 --> 31:03.200
The delivery girl
is the mole.

31:03.200 --> 31:05.000
The detective took Chuck.

31:07.400 --> 31:08.400
Where are you, Chuck?

31:08.400 --> 31:09.500
I need the ring.

31:11.700 --> 31:13.300
This is not awesome.

31:17.400 --> 31:18.800
MAN:
And the package, HQ.

31:18.800 --> 31:20.100
This is Long Shore.

31:29.000 --> 31:30.100
You're not a cop.

31:42.400 --> 31:44.100
We've identified
the enemy agent.

31:44.100 --> 31:45.700
She was posing
as a Pita Parlour

31:45.700 --> 31:46.500
delivery girl.

31:46.800 --> 31:47.800
Code name Lizzie.

31:47.800 --> 31:50.500
BECKMAN:
So she escaped
with the receiver?

31:50.700 --> 31:51.700
Yes, but she made a phone call.

31:51.700 --> 31:53.400
We're currently tracing
the cell signature,

31:53.400 --> 31:55.000
and we can triangulate
her location.

31:55.000 --> 31:55.900
We just need more time.

31:55.900 --> 31:57.200
GRAHAM:
As soon as you locate her,

31:57.500 --> 31:58.500
take her out.

31:58.500 --> 31:59.600
Uh, one of us
needs to go

31:59.600 --> 32:01.100
and get Chuck out
of police custody.

32:01.100 --> 32:02.500
He was arrested just...
BECKMAN:
The Intersect

32:02.500 --> 32:04.700
is no longer your concern,
Agent Walker.

32:05.200 --> 32:06.400
I... I don't understand.

32:06.400 --> 32:08.700
BECKMAN:
Detective Conway is CIA.

32:09.000 --> 32:09.800
GRAHAM:
Chuck is on his way

32:09.800 --> 32:12.000
to the extraction
point right now.

32:12.000 --> 32:14.900
We've decided to transfer him
to lockdown immediately.

32:16.500 --> 32:17.800
Is there a problem?

32:17.800 --> 32:18.900
Uh, no.

32:18.900 --> 32:21.700
No. I just thought
I would handle his transfer.

32:21.800 --> 32:23.600
Forget about Chuck,
Agent Walker.

32:24.000 --> 32:26.400
Focus on catching
that FULCRUM agent.

32:26.600 --> 32:27.300
We're on it.

32:28.900 --> 32:29.500
We, meaning,

32:29.500 --> 32:31.700
I go get Lizzie
while you find Chuck.

32:33.900 --> 32:35.900
Well, don't make me
change my mind.

32:39.300 --> 32:40.100
So...

32:41.300 --> 32:42.200
this is it, huh?

32:43.200 --> 32:44.600
Going to get my own padded cell.

32:45.600 --> 32:46.700
Do I get a bed, or is

32:46.700 --> 32:48.000
my whole room
kind of like a bed?

32:48.600 --> 32:49.800
It's not as bad as it sounds.

32:50.800 --> 32:52.100
The underground complex

32:52.100 --> 32:53.000
where you
will be living

32:53.000 --> 32:54.700
has state-of-the-art
security and amenities.

32:55.200 --> 32:57.400
You'll even be allowed outside
to visit controlled locations.

33:03.500 --> 33:04.300
Hold on.

33:04.300 --> 33:06.300
I-I... I can't leave
without telling Ellie something,

33:06.300 --> 33:07.100
a reason for going.

33:07.100 --> 33:07.900
What should I say?

33:07.900 --> 33:08.800
Nothing.

33:09.600 --> 33:12.300
It's safer for them
if you just... disappear.

33:17.700 --> 33:19.200
CONWAY:
 <i>Asset is ready for extraction.</i>

33:19.600 --> 33:20.500
 <i>Send in the chopper.</i>

33:29.000 --> 33:29.800
Long Shore!

33:32.400 --> 33:34.000
Is there a problem,
Agent Walker?
Sarah,

33:34.000 --> 33:35.000
thank God you're here.
Listen, I-I don't...

33:35.000 --> 33:36.200
I don't want
to go yet. I...

33:36.200 --> 33:37.800
It's okay, Chuck. Agent Casey

33:37.800 --> 33:38.700
is tracking the
FULCRUM mole.

33:38.700 --> 33:40.100
He should have her
in custody soon,

33:40.100 --> 33:41.100
so we can hold off

33:41.100 --> 33:43.400
on the Chuck transfer
for the time being.

33:44.100 --> 33:45.500
If there was a change
in the operation,

33:45.500 --> 33:47.700
I would have been contacted.
I have my orders.

33:47.700 --> 33:49.500
We don't have to do this.
This is a judgment call.

33:49.500 --> 33:52.300
Okay, we can just hold Chuck
here until we know for sure.

33:52.300 --> 33:53.700
His cover was blown.
He's gone.

33:53.700 --> 33:55.600
No. I will take
full responsibility.

33:55.600 --> 33:57.200
Chuck is my asset;
he's my guy.

33:58.000 --> 34:00.000
Just... Just give us
more time, please.

34:00.900 --> 34:01.800
CHUCK:
I'd appreciate it.

34:01.800 --> 34:02.900
I really would.

34:05.500 --> 34:06.600
Please don't do this.

34:10.400 --> 34:11.000
CONWAY:
Okay.

34:11.000 --> 34:12.300
You've got one minute.

34:12.600 --> 34:13.300
One minute.

34:21.500 --> 34:22.500
I'm not ready, Sarah.

34:22.500 --> 34:23.300
I'm not ready
to disappear.

34:23.300 --> 34:24.100
No. I know,
I know.

34:24.100 --> 34:25.500
I need you to talk to Ellie

34:25.500 --> 34:27.500
and to Morgan and my friends,

34:27.500 --> 34:29.300
and-and-
and-and tell 'em...

34:29.300 --> 34:31.600
I don't know. I...

34:31.600 --> 34:34.100
Look, if I'm supposed
to be dead, just say something

34:34.100 --> 34:35.900
that will make it okay,

34:35.900 --> 34:37.300
that will make 'em
feel all right.

34:39.600 --> 34:41.199
Just make sure they know
how much I love 'em.

34:42.300 --> 34:43.100
You can do that, right?

34:43.699 --> 34:46.600
Course you can. You're Sarah.
You can do anything.

34:48.199 --> 34:50.500
And, hey, there's a silver
lining to this, too, you know,

34:51.199 --> 34:52.500
'cause we're not working
together anymore,

34:52.500 --> 34:54.699
which means,
we can go on a date.

34:55.699 --> 34:57.600
You can come by my cell,
and we can hang out,

34:57.600 --> 34:59.600
and you can tell me
who the president is.

35:01.300 --> 35:02.400
And maybe, uh...

35:04.700 --> 35:06.700
...maybe we can see
how we really feel.

35:09.600 --> 35:10.500
Time's up.

35:14.800 --> 35:15.700
Good-bye, Sarah.

35:20.500 --> 35:21.300
Chuck?

35:24.200 --> 35:25.000
I'll save you later.

35:32.700 --> 35:34.100
(gunshot)
Oh!

35:34.100 --> 35:35.700
Oh!
Chuck, get down.

35:35.700 --> 35:38.300
(gunshot)

35:38.000 --> 35:39.500
Go, go, go!

35:47.100 --> 35:49.000
I listened to the receiver.

35:49.700 --> 35:50.500
BOTH:
She knows.

35:51.100 --> 35:53.200
Do you know
how many agents are looking

35:53.200 --> 35:54.100
for Bryce Larkin?

35:54.100 --> 35:55.700
And all this time,

35:55.700 --> 35:57.200
the Intersect was here.

35:57.900 --> 36:00.300
Wait till
I tell my superiors that.

36:00.800 --> 36:02.400
Okay, look, what if
I surrender, and you run?

36:02.400 --> 36:03.800
I mean, I'm going
in a cell anyway.

36:03.800 --> 36:05.200
What's the difference?
Torture.

36:05.200 --> 36:06.700
Okay, no surrender.

36:07.500 --> 36:09.600
I only have one question, Chuck.

36:10.200 --> 36:11.800
Who's the ring for?

36:12.000 --> 36:13.800
She has Ellie's
engagement ring?

36:13.800 --> 36:14.600
Try to distract her.

36:14.600 --> 36:15.700
What?! How?

36:24.000 --> 36:25.700
Chuck, I'm not gonna
to go away.

36:25.700 --> 36:26.900
Okay... okay,
look, look, look.

36:26.900 --> 36:28.500
You really... You really
want to take me in?

36:28.500 --> 36:30.500
You're going to have
to sweeten the deal
a little bit for me.

36:33.400 --> 36:35.400
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Uh, look.

36:35.400 --> 36:36.300
Look, the CIA--

36:36.300 --> 36:39.600
they're offering me a nice
padded cell, real cush.

36:39.600 --> 36:40.400
Can you beat that?

36:40.400 --> 36:42.800
I'm a guy who enjoys
a... a good steam.

36:42.800 --> 36:43.500
Can you do...?

36:43.500 --> 36:45.400
Can you do maybe a
steam room or something?

36:45.400 --> 36:47.600
I don't think you're really
in a position to bargain, Chuck.

36:47.600 --> 36:49.100
I have two guns.

36:49.100 --> 36:50.400
What do you have?

36:50.400 --> 36:51.600
Me.

36:54.800 --> 36:55.900
Don't break the ring.

37:00.400 --> 37:01.100
Whoa!

37:02.600 --> 37:04.600
Oh! Oh!

37:06.300 --> 37:08.400
Hey! Bartowski,
get out of the way.

37:10.400 --> 37:12.400
There's really
some serious spy
fighting going on.

37:14.000 --> 37:15.000
CASEY:
Get down, Bartowski.

37:20.600 --> 37:21.500
Sarah!
(grunts)

37:29.300 --> 37:31.100
I had a feeling
that girl was dirty.

37:55.900 --> 37:56.800
Norman.

38:06.000 --> 38:07.500
The power of positive thinking.

38:08.500 --> 38:09.900
This was an amazing night.

38:10.700 --> 38:11.600
As it always is with...

38:13.700 --> 38:17.500
But, sometimes, I know life
isn't always awesome.

38:21.000 --> 38:26.000
What I'm trying to say is that,
when things get rough,

38:26.800 --> 38:29.700
 <i>I want to face them together,</i>
 <i>the good times and the bad..</i>

38:29.700 --> 38:31.100
Oh! Oh! Oh!

38:31.100 --> 38:32.100
Ladies' feminine products.

38:32.100 --> 38:33.400
That's not good.
That's not good.

38:33.400 --> 38:35.200
Are you, uh...

38:35.200 --> 38:36.700
Are you sure tAre yo

38:36.700 --> 38:38.100
Are you sure that Lizzie
didn't have the ring on her?

38:38.100 --> 38:39.800
When they took her away,
all she had was the receiver.

38:39.800 --> 38:41.500
Oh, then it's got
to be here somewhere.

38:41.500 --> 38:44.400
You know, Chuck, if
we can't find it, we
can just replace it.

38:44.400 --> 38:46.700
Look, look, look, it-it was
Awesome's great-granny's ring,

38:46.700 --> 38:48.300
and it's going
to be my sister's, okay?

38:48.300 --> 38:50.700
Even if its covered in coffee
grounds and miscellaneous DNA.

38:51.800 --> 38:54.400
I have a ring, I have
the blessing of your brother.

38:55.900 --> 38:58.300
Will you do me the honor
of becoming my wife,

38:58.300 --> 38:59.700
Eleanor Faye Bartowski?

39:01.900 --> 39:03.700
CAPTAIN:
 <i>Ooh. Almost woke her up.</i>

39:03.700 --> 39:06.200
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

39:06.300 --> 39:08.300
Ah! Hey!

39:09.500 --> 39:12.100
Oh, I found it!

39:13.200 --> 39:14.100
 <i>Let's go.</i>

39:30.500 --> 39:31.700
I'm so sorry...

39:32.600 --> 39:34.000
but it might be
a little dirty.

39:36.300 --> 39:37.300
Way to go, Chuck.

39:37.800 --> 39:39.300
I always knew you could
handle my family jewels.

39:40.400 --> 39:41.300
So to speak.

39:46.600 --> 39:49.200
Uh, when she's sleeping
really hard like that,

39:49.200 --> 39:51.100
sometimes, if you pinch
her nose, it'll wake...

39:52.700 --> 39:53.500
Right.

39:53.500 --> 39:55.200
I'm going to...
Oh, okay.

40:07.500 --> 40:08.700
Mission accomplished.

40:09.500 --> 40:10.700
I can't believe
we pulled it off.

40:11.500 --> 40:13.300
That'll make one hell
of a story at their wedding.

40:14.800 --> 40:15.900
Which I'm never allowed

40:15.900 --> 40:17.600
to talk about under fear
of death-- understood.

40:17.600 --> 40:18.400
I have other material.

40:19.700 --> 40:20.500
You want to?

40:23.400 --> 40:26.600
What, spy? You?

40:31.400 --> 40:32.800
She looks so happy.

40:32.800 --> 40:33.900
Yeah, she does.

40:36.500 --> 40:37.700
I couldn't
leave them yet.

40:38.600 --> 40:40.000
You don't have
to worry about that.

40:40.900 --> 40:41.700
You're safe.

40:43.500 --> 40:46.300
Yeah, safe for now,
though. Right.

40:46.300 --> 40:49.100
I mean... they keep
getting closer.

40:49.100 --> 40:51.100
Eventually, they're going
to figure out who I am.

40:51.100 --> 40:53.300
Don't you think you should
go in and congratulate Ellie?

40:57.200 --> 40:58.000
You want to
come in with me?

40:59.500 --> 41:00.800
Oh, it's family time.

41:03.500 --> 41:04.300
I know.

41:07.700 --> 41:08.700
Well, good night.

41:13.100 --> 41:14.200
CHUCK (laughing):
Hey!

41:15.800 --> 41:17.200
Hey, buddy.
Yeah.

41:19.700 --> 41:20.400
Hmm.

41:28.000 --> 41:29.400
We can only keep him here
for so long.

41:30.800 --> 41:32.300
You realize that,
don't you?

41:34.500 --> 41:36.200
I love you,
sweetie.
I love you.

41:36.200 --> 41:38.600
I'm sorry I had to keep it
a secret for a little while.
