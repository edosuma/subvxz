WEBVTT

00:04.338 --> 00:08.376
DO YOU KNOW WHO'S DOING THIS?
NO, BUT I ALSO KNOW THAT
"A" ISN'T PLAYING AROUND.

00:08.409 --> 00:11.545
WE HAVE THREE HOURS TO
FIND OUT WHO "A" IS
BEFORE "A" FINDS US.

00:11.579 --> 00:13.914
THIS IS "A's" LAIR.

00:13.947 --> 00:16.149
"A" IS DRESSED
LIKE THE BLACK SWAN.

00:16.184 --> 00:18.619
I DON'T WANT ARIA WITH HIM
ANY MORE THAN YOU DO,

00:18.652 --> 00:22.056
BUT IF YOU BACK HIM
INTO A CORNER,
NOBODY WILL END UP HAPPY.

00:22.090 --> 00:24.958
YOU'RE CONNECTED TO JENNA
AND IAN AND JASON--

00:24.992 --> 00:27.295
ALMOST LIKE YOU GUYS WERE
MEMBERS OF THE SAME CLUB.

00:27.328 --> 00:28.662
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST.
FOR WHAT?

00:28.696 --> 00:30.464
THE MURDER OF
ALISON DiLAURENTIS.

00:30.498 --> 00:31.665
IT'S ABOUT REVENGE.

00:31.699 --> 00:33.567
YOU DESERVED
EVERYTHING YOU GOT.

00:33.601 --> 00:34.902
MONA'S "A."

00:34.935 --> 00:38.206
( screaming )
MONA!

00:38.239 --> 00:41.542
THEY THINK IT'S OVER.
LOSER MONA'S GOING
TO THE NUTHOUSE,

00:41.575 --> 00:43.811
AND THOSE PRECIOUS LIARS
ARE GOING HOME TO SLEEP

00:43.844 --> 00:45.913
WITH THEIR WINDOWS OPEN
AND THEIR DOORS UNLOCKED.

00:45.946 --> 00:47.881
DON'T THEY KNOW
THAT'S WHAT WE WANT?

00:47.915 --> 00:50.884
THEY FOUND A BODY.
THEY THINK IT'S MAYA.

00:50.918 --> 00:53.187
( crying )

00:54.955 --> 00:56.757
* NA NA NA, COME ON

00:58.526 --> 01:00.728
* NA NA NA, COME ON

01:02.163 --> 01:05.799
* NA NA NA, COME ON,
 COME ON, COME ON *

01:05.833 --> 01:07.168
* NA NA NA NA,
 COME ON... *

01:07.201 --> 01:09.737
Hanna: EM,
YOU AND I ARE THE ONLY ONES

01:09.770 --> 01:11.605
WHO DID ANYTHING
WORTH TALKING ABOUT THIS SUMMER.

01:11.639 --> 01:14.908
ARIA TOOK
SOME BORING PICTURE CLASS
AND SPENCER WENT TO COLLEGE.

01:14.942 --> 01:16.944
I TOOK A FULL LOAD AT HOLLIS,

01:16.977 --> 01:18.846
AND ARIA BEAT OUT
A THOUSANDS APPLICANTS

01:18.879 --> 01:20.281
FOR A SPACE IN THAT
PHOTOGRAPHY CLASS.

01:20.314 --> 01:22.616
SO, HOW MANY HOUSES
DID YOU BUILD?

01:22.650 --> 01:24.818
UH, I THINK
WE FINISHED ABOUT SIX.

01:24.852 --> 01:26.187
AND IN POOR COUNTRIES,

01:26.220 --> 01:28.722
ONE HOUSE IS LIKE
A HOME FOR FIFTY.

01:28.756 --> 01:30.724
OKAY, MISS PRODUCTIVE.

01:30.758 --> 01:32.726
HOW MUCH OF YOUR LIST
DID YOU ACTUALLY DO?

01:32.760 --> 01:34.762
LET'S SEE...

01:34.795 --> 01:37.398
COOKING CLASS WITH CALEB.
DONE.

01:37.431 --> 01:39.733
VOLUNTEER AT THE ANIMAL
SHELTER FOR POCKET DOGS--

01:39.767 --> 01:42.870
WAIT. THAT EXISTS?
DID N DO.

01:42.903 --> 01:46.307
EXPAND MY VOCABULARY.
"EFFECTUATING."

01:46.340 --> 01:49.877
INTERNED FOR VERA WANG.
YOU GOT AN INTERNSHIP
FOR VERA WANG?

01:49.910 --> 01:51.279
YEAH,
I CHANGED MY MIND.

01:51.312 --> 01:53.781
TURNS OUT THEY WANT YOU
TO WORK FOR FREE.

01:53.814 --> 01:56.617
( distant noise )
WAS THAT A CAR?

01:56.650 --> 01:58.219
NO, IT'S JUST THE WIND.

01:58.252 --> 02:00.888
OH, CAREFUL, EM,
THEY'RE ALREADY PRETTY STRONG.

02:00.921 --> 02:02.923
MAYBE FOR YOU,
YOU'RE A PIXIE.

02:02.956 --> 02:05.826
I'VE GOTTEN
REALLY GOOD AT THIS.

02:07.094 --> 02:09.597
( cell phone ringing )

02:09.630 --> 02:12.065
( phones chime )

02:14.034 --> 02:17.305
"SHOW ME YOUR BOOBS.
'A'."

02:17.338 --> 02:20.774
DOES MONA HAVE
A TEN-YEAR-OLD BROTHER?
"A" FOR "ANNOYING."

02:20.808 --> 02:22.276
ARE THESE EVER
GONNA STOP?

02:22.310 --> 02:23.644
EVENTUALLY
WE'LL BE OLD NEWS.

02:23.677 --> 02:25.246
YEAH, AND THEN GARRETT
WILL GO ON TRIAL

02:25.279 --> 02:26.847
AND WE'LL BE NEWS AGAIN.

02:26.880 --> 02:29.650
OR MONA WILL START TALKING
AND WE'LL BE NEWS AGAIN.

02:29.683 --> 02:32.853
OR I'LL SHOW SOMEONE MY BOOBS
AND WE'LL BE NEWS AGAIN.

02:32.886 --> 02:34.822
OKAY! (laughs)

02:34.855 --> 02:38.626
HEY, I THOUGHT
THIS WAS A PARTY.

02:38.659 --> 02:42.930
YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU'RE RIGHT, EM.
WELCOME BACK.

02:42.963 --> 02:45.999
AND YOU'RE NEVER
ALLOWED TO LEAVE FOR
AN ENTIRE SUMMER AGAIN.

02:46.033 --> 02:48.269
TO MAKING IT TO SENIOR YEAR.

02:48.302 --> 02:49.637
HEAR!

02:49.670 --> 02:51.639
NOT ALL OF US MADE IT.

02:53.106 --> 02:55.976
I'M SORRY, EM.
I DIDN'T MEAN IT LIKE THAT.

02:56.009 --> 02:57.578
( sighs )

02:57.611 --> 02:59.780
TO MAYA.

03:03.517 --> 03:05.786
EM, YOU KNOW THAT
WE'RE HERE FOR YOU.

03:08.589 --> 03:10.858
TO MAYA.
TO MAYA.
TO MAYA.

03:22.336 --> 03:24.505
( thunder crashes )

03:32.746 --> 03:34.782
HANNA.

03:36.950 --> 03:38.419
( Hanna groans )

03:38.452 --> 03:40.521
WHERE'S EMILY
AND SPENCER?

03:40.554 --> 03:43.023
I DON'T KNOW.

03:43.056 --> 03:46.126
I NEED AN ASPIRIN
AND A TROUGH OF WATER.

03:46.159 --> 03:48.662
EMILY?
Spencer: SHE'S GONE.

03:48.696 --> 03:50.631
WHAT DO YOU MEAN SHE'S GONE?

03:50.664 --> 03:53.267
I'VE LOOKED EVERYWHERE.

03:54.502 --> 03:55.969
( Hanna dialing )

03:58.572 --> 04:01.375
( cell phone ringing )

04:04.712 --> 04:07.114
( continues ringing )

04:29.537 --> 04:32.039
* GOT A SECRET,
 CAN YOU KEEP IT *

04:32.072 --> 04:34.808
* SWEAR THIS ONE
 YOU'LL SAVE *

04:34.842 --> 04:37.044
* BETTER LOCK IT
 IN YOUR POCKET *

04:37.077 --> 04:39.647
* TAKING THIS ONE
 TO THE GRAVE *

04:39.680 --> 04:44.618
* IF I SHOW YOU, WELL I KNOW
 YOU WON'T TELL WHAT I SAID *

04:44.652 --> 04:49.823
* 'CAUSE TWO CAN KEEP A SECRET
 IF ONE OF THEM IS DEAD *

04:58.832 --> 05:01.168
HOW COULD SHE NOT
REMEMBER ANYTHING?

05:01.201 --> 05:04.738
SHE'S TOTALLY OUT OF IT.
SHE'S STILL DRUNK.

05:04.772 --> 05:08.108
YOU DON'T THINK THAT
SHE HAD ANYTHING TO DO
WITH THIS, DO YOU?

05:08.141 --> 05:11.244
NO! SHE--
SHE CAN HARDLY STAND.

05:11.278 --> 05:13.414
HOW DID SHE GET HERE?

05:13.447 --> 05:16.049
HANN, HAND ME
EM'S PHONE.

05:19.520 --> 05:22.456
EM, YOU GOT A BLOCKED CALL
AT ELEVEN.

05:22.490 --> 05:24.725
WHO WAS IT? DO YOU REMEMBER
WHO YOU TALKED TO?

05:24.758 --> 05:28.896
UM...I THINK I REMEMBER
LEAVING YOUR HOUSE,

05:28.929 --> 05:32.400
AND THE NEXT THING I KNOW
YOU GUYS ARE CALLING ME

05:32.433 --> 05:33.834
AND I'M HERE.

05:33.867 --> 05:38.038
Spencer: WHAT?
THAT CAN'T BE RIGHT.
Aria: WHAT IS IT?

05:38.071 --> 05:41.642
IT SAYS THAT AT MIDNIGHT
SHE GOT A CALL FROM MY PHONE.

05:41.675 --> 05:43.310
YOU WERE ASLEEP,
RIGHT?

05:43.343 --> 05:46.246
OH, MY GOD. SOMEBODY
CALLED EMILY FROM MY PHONE.

05:46.279 --> 05:49.116
SOMEBODY WAS IN MY HOUSE.
YOU GUYS, THIS IS A SET-UP.

05:49.149 --> 05:52.019
( twig snaps )
WHAT WAS THAT?

05:53.086 --> 05:56.390
WE NEED TO GET OUT OF HERE.
 NOW.

05:56.424 --> 05:57.858
COME ON.

06:02.195 --> 06:05.098
IF I NEVER SEE ANOTHER SHOVEL
AGAIN, IT'LL BE TOO SOON.

06:05.132 --> 06:07.568
WAIT. DO WE WIPE IT OFF
OR SOMETHING?

06:07.601 --> 06:09.903
DO WE WIPE OFF
THE PRINTS?

06:12.973 --> 06:15.008
WHO WOULD DO THIS
TO EMILY?

06:15.042 --> 06:17.210
WHO WOULD DO IT
TO ALI?

06:17.244 --> 06:19.913
SOME TWISTED PSYCHO.

06:19.947 --> 06:23.517
THE ONLY TWISTED PSYCHO WE KNOW
IS LOCKED UP AT RADLEY.

06:27.220 --> 06:29.122
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.

06:29.156 --> 06:30.791
( thunder crashes )

06:30.824 --> 06:32.493
EVERYTHING?

06:32.526 --> 06:34.194
EVERYTHING.

06:37.030 --> 06:41.435
THE ONLY PERSON WHO BENEFITS
FROM A MISSING BODY
IS ALI'S KILLER.

06:41.469 --> 06:43.704
HE KILLED MAYA, TOO.
I KNOW, EM.

06:43.737 --> 06:47.140
AND GARRETT'S GONNA
ROT IN HELL FOR IT.

06:48.075 --> 06:50.043
JENNA WOULDN'T HELP GARRETT.

06:50.077 --> 06:52.045
SHE PUT HIM IN JAIL.

06:52.079 --> 06:53.581
WHAT ABOUT YOUR SISTER?

06:53.614 --> 06:55.483
SHE'S IN PHILADELPHIA,
AND AS FAR AS WE KNOW,

06:55.516 --> 06:56.850
THE ONLY THING
SHE'S GUILTY OF

06:56.884 --> 07:01.088
IS BEING IN ALI'S ROOM
THE NIGHT THAT SHE DIED.

07:01.121 --> 07:03.957
THERE HAS TO BE
SOMEONE ELSE...

07:03.991 --> 07:07.628
SOMEONE WE DON'T KNOW
WHO'S CONNECTED TO GARRETT.

07:31.218 --> 07:32.853
DUCK.

07:32.886 --> 07:33.987
REALLY?

07:34.021 --> 07:35.789
GET DOWN!

07:37.825 --> 07:40.060
IT'S LUCAS. WHAT IS HE
DOING OUT SO LATE?

07:40.093 --> 07:41.428
SHH!

07:41.461 --> 07:42.462
HANNA,
HE CAN'T HEAR US.

07:42.496 --> 07:44.898
( car alarm chirps off )

07:56.644 --> 07:58.712
( thunder crashes )

08:04.017 --> 08:05.519
WHAT'S GOING ON?

08:05.553 --> 08:08.188
Spencer: WE'RE LEAVING.
WE'RE GOING TO THE LAKE HOUSE.

08:08.221 --> 08:12.092
WHEN MY MOM READS THIS NOTE,
SHE'LL THINK THAT WE'VE BEEN
UP THERE SINCE THIS AFTERNOON.

08:12.125 --> 08:13.126
EM?

08:26.707 --> 08:29.109
( ringing )

08:36.950 --> 08:38.318
HELLO?

08:38.351 --> 08:40.988
I'M SORRY IF I WOKE YOU UP.

08:42.856 --> 08:45.826
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO
TELL YOU THIS...

08:49.797 --> 08:52.766
WERE THERE...ANY WITNESSES?

08:56.236 --> 08:58.906
NO, MOM, I--
I UNDERSTAND.

09:01.541 --> 09:03.343
OKAY, BYE.

09:03.376 --> 09:04.912
( hangs up phone )

09:07.147 --> 09:09.817
THE CARETAKER CALLED IT IN
THIS MORNING.

09:09.850 --> 09:12.419
THE PLACE IS CRAWLING
WITH REPORTERS,

09:12.452 --> 09:15.255
BUT THE POLICE
DON'T HAVE ANY LEADS.

09:15.288 --> 09:18.626
(exhales) SO WE'RE OKAY.
NOBODY SAW US.

09:18.659 --> 09:20.060
YEAH.

09:21.629 --> 09:24.031
I'M SO SORRY, GUYS.

09:24.064 --> 09:25.599
THIS IS ALL MY FAULT.

09:25.633 --> 09:27.200
NO ONE'S BLAMING YOU.

09:27.234 --> 09:28.669
YEAH, EM. SOMEBODY
TOOK YOU THERE

09:28.702 --> 09:31.238
TO MAKE IT LOOK LIKE
YOU DUG UP ALI'S BODY.

09:31.271 --> 09:34.742
AND I MADE IT SO EASY.
IF I WASN'T SO WASTED--

09:34.775 --> 09:36.644
EM.

09:36.677 --> 09:39.847
LAST NIGHT
NEVER HAPPENED.

09:39.880 --> 09:42.616
ARE WE SURE ABOUT THAT?

09:42.650 --> 09:45.953
WE CAN STILL GO TO THE COPS.
WE CAN TELL THEM THE TRUTH.

09:45.986 --> 09:49.657
WE DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT THE TRUTH IS.

09:49.690 --> 09:51.959
( sighs )

09:53.293 --> 09:54.995
OKAY.

09:55.028 --> 09:57.631
WE GOT UP HERE
YESTERDAY AFTERNOON.

09:57.665 --> 09:59.633
WE ROASTED SOME MARSHMALLOWS,

09:59.667 --> 10:03.070
WE TALKED ABOUT HOW MUCH FUN
SENIOR YEAR IS GONNA BE, AND...

10:03.103 --> 10:05.105
WE WENT TO BED EARLY.

10:07.440 --> 10:09.209
EM?

10:10.844 --> 10:13.280
I UNDERSTAND.

10:25.258 --> 10:25.859
( gasps )
Ezra: ARE YOU OKAY?

10:29.763 --> 10:30.798
AR--

10:33.300 --> 10:35.535
I THOUGHT
THE NIGHTMARES STOPPED.

10:35.568 --> 10:38.772
I GUESS
THEY STARTED AGAIN.

10:38.806 --> 10:41.809
HEY...
YOU'RE STILL SAFE, ARIA.

10:41.842 --> 10:44.111
THERE'S NO MORE "A."

10:44.144 --> 10:46.880
YOU WERE FAR AWAY FROM
THIS MESS LAST NIGHT.

10:46.914 --> 10:50.483
THANK GOD YOU STAYED
AT SPENCER'S LAKE HOUSE.

10:53.987 --> 10:55.789
DID YOU READ THIS?

10:57.157 --> 11:00.593
APPARENTLY MAYA FOUND SOME
THINGS THAT BELONGED TO ALISON.

11:00.627 --> 11:04.064
NO, NO. SHE--
SHE GAVE EVERYTHING TO JASON.

11:04.097 --> 11:06.666
WELL, ACTUALLY,
THEY THINK SHE MAY HAVE
KEPT SOMETHING,

11:06.700 --> 11:10.570
SOMETHING THAT CONNECTED GARRETT
TO ALISON'S MURDER.

11:10.603 --> 11:13.473
THAT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.
SHE WOULD HAVE TOLD EMILY.

11:13.506 --> 11:19.312
WELL, MAYBE THAT'S WHAT
SHE WAS ON HER WAY TO DO,
BUT GARRETT FOUND HER FIRST.

11:23.817 --> 11:25.953
DO YOU KNOW WHAT
THIS WEEKEND IS?

11:25.986 --> 11:28.021
HOW COULD I FORGET?

11:28.055 --> 11:32.159
LABOR DAY IS THE ANNIVERSARY
OF ALISON'S DEATH.

11:32.192 --> 11:33.794
OR...

11:33.827 --> 11:38.065
I WAS ABOUT TO START
A TEACHING JOB,

11:38.098 --> 11:40.901
AND YOU THOUGHT YOU
MIGHT LIKE TO TEACH...

11:40.934 --> 11:43.670
WAS THAT TRUE,
OR WERE YOU JUST
HITTING ON ME?

11:43.703 --> 11:47.040
DID YOU REALLY PLAY B26,
OR WERE YOU JUST
HITTING ON ME?

11:47.074 --> 11:49.109
( laughs )

11:50.577 --> 11:54.714
CAN WE MAKE THIS...
 OUR ANNIVERSARY

11:54.748 --> 11:56.216
INSTEAD OF HERS?

11:56.249 --> 11:59.686
MEET ME TOMORROW NIGHT
AT THE ROSEWOOD GRILLE.

11:59.719 --> 12:02.923
I WILL BE THE GUY AT THE BAR
READING ULYSSES.

12:02.956 --> 12:05.458
YOU STILL HAVEN'T
FINISHED THAT BOOK?

12:05.492 --> 12:07.427
NO ONE HAS.

12:07.460 --> 12:09.830
( both laugh )

12:09.863 --> 12:11.765
I'M JUST A HOPELESS ROMANTIC.

12:11.799 --> 12:14.101
I THOUGHT WE COULD
RECREATE THE DATE.

12:14.134 --> 12:16.236
I WOULDN'T EXACTLY
CALL IT A DATE.

12:16.269 --> 12:19.272
WE ENDED THE NIGHT
IN THE BATHROOM.

12:19.306 --> 12:21.108
I REMEMBER.

12:21.141 --> 12:25.745
I THINK IT WENT
SOMETHING LIKE...THIS?

12:25.779 --> 12:28.816
AND THEN I DID
SOMETHING LIKE THIS...

12:29.783 --> 12:34.254
* ANYTHING YOU WANT

12:34.287 --> 12:37.457
* DARLING, I KNOW,
 I KNOW, I KNOW *

12:37.490 --> 12:40.693
* IT SEEMS LIKE YEARS

12:40.727 --> 12:44.031
* MOVING IN ALL DIRECTIONS

12:44.064 --> 12:47.200
* LEAVING IT ALL BEHIND

12:47.234 --> 12:50.370
* TONIGHT

12:50.403 --> 12:52.705
* TONIGHT

12:52.739 --> 12:55.742
* I'LL FEEL ALIVE

12:55.775 --> 12:57.410
* AROUND THE WORLD

12:57.444 --> 13:01.514
* JUST THINK
 I'LL BE YOUR GIRL *

13:10.790 --> 13:13.293
HANNA?
YOU LIKE THIS?

13:13.326 --> 13:16.296
YEAH, I LOVE IT...
FOR A PREGNANT WOMAN.

13:16.329 --> 13:19.166
IS THERE SOMETHING
I NEED TO KNOW?

13:19.199 --> 13:21.334
I'D NEED TO HAVE SEX
TO GET PREGNANT.

13:21.368 --> 13:23.904
EW! MOM,
THAT'S GROSS.

13:23.937 --> 13:26.273
WELL, SINCE WHEN DID YOU
BECOME A PRUDE?

13:26.306 --> 13:28.641
SINCE YOU INTIMATED
THAT YOU WANT TO HAVE SEX.

13:28.675 --> 13:31.078
HANNA--
ALL RIGHT, YOU'RE
ALLOWED TO DATE,

13:31.111 --> 13:32.846
BUT YOU'RE NOT...
OPEN FOR BUSINESS.

13:32.880 --> 13:35.949
HANNA--
ARE YOU STARTING
A BUSINESS, ASHLEY?

13:35.983 --> 13:39.286
( sighs ) GO. SHOP.

13:44.791 --> 13:47.294
I WAS HOPING A LITTLE
RETAIL THERAPY

13:47.327 --> 13:49.863
MIGHT TAKE HANNA'S MIND
OFF THE HEADLINES.

13:49.897 --> 13:51.464
YEAH, ONE MURDER
MAKES THE NEWS,

13:51.498 --> 13:53.766
BUT TWO DEAD GIRLS
AND A MISSING BODY?

13:53.800 --> 13:55.368
HOW BIG IS YOUR CLOSET?

13:57.070 --> 13:58.305
HE DID IT, RIGHT?

13:58.338 --> 14:01.241
GARRETT HIRED SOMEONE
TO DIG UP THAT GRAVE?

14:01.274 --> 14:06.313
THIS HASN'T MADE THE PAPERS,

14:06.346 --> 14:09.149
BUT IT WAS GONE BEFORE
THE JUDGE COULD MAKE HIS RULING.

14:09.182 --> 14:11.084
I DON'T THINK
IT'S A COINCIDENCE.

14:11.118 --> 14:14.687
CAN I JUST TELL YOU,
I AM SO RELIEVED THAT THE GIRLS
WERE OUT OF TOWN LAST NIGHT.

14:14.721 --> 14:18.225
FOR ONCE THEY WERE
READING THE NEWS
INSTEAD OF MAKING IT.

14:20.027 --> 14:21.494
( cell phone ringing )

14:22.996 --> 14:24.497
( ringing )

14:27.734 --> 14:29.269
IT WAS JUST TOBY.
I'LL CALL HIM BACK.

14:29.302 --> 14:30.603
DOES HE LIKE THE LOFT?

14:30.637 --> 14:33.406
WELL, HE COMES OVER
TO SHOWER EVERY DAY

14:33.440 --> 14:35.142
BECAUSE THE PLUMBING
IS BROKEN,

14:35.175 --> 14:37.077
SO I REALLY LIKE THE LOFT.

14:37.110 --> 14:39.179
HMM.
( laughs )

14:40.813 --> 14:42.315
( whispering )

14:42.349 --> 14:46.853
WE ARE ALWAYS GOING TO BE
THOSE GIRLS WHO KNEW ALISON.

14:46.886 --> 14:48.555
AND NOW MAYA.

14:50.257 --> 14:53.826
HEY! YOU KNOW WHAT?
I COULD TAKE A PICTURE
AND SEND IT TO YOU.

14:57.730 --> 15:01.434
LOOK, I KEEP ON
REPLAYING LAST NIGHT
IN MY HEAD.

15:01.468 --> 15:03.136
HANNA, THERE WAS
SOMEBODY IN MY HOUSE.

15:03.170 --> 15:05.638
WHILE WE WERE SOUND ASLEEP,
THEY WERE RIGHT THERE,

15:05.672 --> 15:07.574
THEY WERE IN
THE SAME ROOM AS US.

15:07.607 --> 15:09.676
JUST AS I WAS STARTING
TO FEEL SAFE AGAIN.

15:09.709 --> 15:11.478
I JUST-- I REALLY
WANT TO TURN MY BRAIN OFF.

15:11.511 --> 15:14.847
CAN WE DITCH OUR MOMS
AND GO CATCH A MOVIE?
OHH, I CAN'T.

15:14.881 --> 15:17.717
I HAVE AN APPOINTMENT
WITH DR. SULLIVAN.

15:17.750 --> 15:20.287
OH. YOU'RE SEEING HER
AGAIN?

15:20.320 --> 15:22.155
YEAH. A LITTLE.

15:22.189 --> 15:25.325
BUT YOU...
WOULDN'T TELL HER ABOUT--

15:25.358 --> 15:26.994
NO!

15:27.027 --> 15:28.996
COME ON, I WOULDN'T
DO THAT TO EMILY.

15:29.029 --> 15:33.066
YEAH, BUT IT'S NOT JUST EMILY.
WE WERE ALL THERE.

15:33.100 --> 15:35.002
HANNA, WE SHOULD
GET GOING.

15:35.035 --> 15:36.003
OKAY.

15:36.036 --> 15:37.804
YOU KNOW WHAT,
I'LL CALL YOU LATER.

15:37.837 --> 15:39.072
OKAY.

15:43.110 --> 15:44.744
OOPS.

15:46.046 --> 15:47.614
ALMOST FORGOT.

15:51.884 --> 15:55.855
YOU'LL NEED TO WEAR IT
WHILE YOU'RE ON THIS FLOOR.

15:55.888 --> 15:58.658
WE STILL HAVEN'T
SEEN ANY CHANGES,

15:58.691 --> 16:02.095
BUT I'M SURE SHE APPRECIATES
YOUR VISITS.

16:02.129 --> 16:03.997
( door buzzer )

16:15.575 --> 16:17.644
YOUR FRIEND IS HERE.

16:21.814 --> 16:24.351
CAN YOU SAY HELLO?

16:58.451 --> 16:59.786
( knock on door )

17:00.887 --> 17:03.523
THAT WAS A REPORTER
AT THE DOOR.

17:03.556 --> 17:07.527
WHOEVER TOOK ALI'S BODY
GAVE HIM REASON TO
START KNOCKING AGAIN.

17:07.560 --> 17:09.096
WHAT DID YOU SAY TO HIM?

17:09.128 --> 17:12.299
BEFORE I SLAMMED THE DOOR
IN HIS FACE, OR AFTER?

17:18.570 --> 17:22.242
YOU KNOW, YOU MADE
A DIFFERENCE THIS SUMMER, EM.

17:22.275 --> 17:26.646
AND I THINK
MAYA WOULD HAVE BEEN PROUD.

17:26.679 --> 17:29.182
I KNOW I AM.

17:29.216 --> 17:31.451
IT WAS A LOT EASIER
TO POUND NAILS IN HAITI

17:31.484 --> 17:33.786
THAN IT WOULD HAVE BEEN
TO STAY HERE.

17:33.820 --> 17:35.355
YOU KNOW,
WHEN GRANDMA DIED,

17:35.388 --> 17:39.292
I THOUGHT I WOULD CARRY
THAT GRIEF WITH ME FOREVER.

17:39.326 --> 17:42.795
BUT TIME REALLY DOES HELP...

17:42.829 --> 17:45.898
AND EVENTUALLY
IT STOPS HURTING SO MUCH.

17:45.932 --> 17:48.501
I'M OKAY, MOM.

17:48.535 --> 17:50.303
REALLY.

17:54.941 --> 17:56.743
BIRDS, BIRDS, BIRDS.

17:58.645 --> 18:02.349
YOU CANNOT FIND A TOP
THIS SEASON WITHOUT
FEATHERS ON IT.

18:14.361 --> 18:17.230
ARE YOU GONNA LOOK
RIGHT THROUGH ME FOREVER?

18:22.034 --> 18:25.672
LOOK, IT'S NOT EASY
FOR ME TO GET HERE, OKAY?

18:25.705 --> 18:28.741
I HAVE BEEN LYING TO
EVERYONE I CARE ABOUT FOR WEEKS,

18:28.775 --> 18:32.179
AND AFTER WHAT HAPPENED
LAST NIGHT, I--

18:36.583 --> 18:39.886
I NEED YOU TO UNDERSTAND
SOMETHING.

18:39.919 --> 18:42.589
I AM NOT DOING THIS FOR YOU.

18:42.622 --> 18:45.024
I'M HERE FOR ME.

18:52.632 --> 18:56.469
I WANT TO KNOW WHAT I DID
TO MAKE YOU HATE ME SO MUCH.

19:16.289 --> 19:19.025
Wren: HANNA?

19:20.360 --> 19:22.495
UM, NO.

19:22.529 --> 19:25.232
NO, YOU MUST HAVE ME
CONFUSED WITH SOMEONE ELSE.

19:25.265 --> 19:26.799
OH, MISS RIVERS, I'M SORRY.

19:26.833 --> 19:29.369
YOUR RESEMBLANCE
TO AN OLD FRIEND IS UNCANNY.

19:29.402 --> 19:31.037
( nervous laugh )

19:31.070 --> 19:33.240
( whispers )
PLEASE DON'T TELL ANYBODY
THAT YOU SAW ME HERE.

19:33.273 --> 19:35.208
WHAT ARE DOING HERE?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

19:35.242 --> 19:39.045
I VOLUNTEER
A FEW DAYS A MONTH.
QUID PRO QUO.
WHAT?

19:39.078 --> 19:40.213
IT'S YOUR TURN.

19:42.449 --> 19:44.351
LOOK, SHE OWES ME
SOME ANSWERS.

19:44.384 --> 19:46.152
I NEED IT TO MAKE SENSE.

19:46.185 --> 19:49.055
SENSE IS SOMETHING RARELY MINED
FROM MENTAL ILLNESS.

19:49.088 --> 19:51.123
TRUST ME, I'VE SPENT
A LIFETIME TRYING.

19:51.157 --> 19:53.660
I'M STARTING
TO FIGURE THAT OUT.

19:53.693 --> 19:56.229
I MEAN, I DON'T THINK
I CAN KEEP COMING BACK.

19:56.263 --> 19:58.665
IT'S LIKE SHE DOESN'T
EVEN KNOW THAT I'M HERE.

20:11.878 --> 20:13.313
I PROMISE I'LL GET
THE PLUMBING FIXED IN THE LOFT
BY THE END OF THE WEEK.

20:15.081 --> 20:18.184
OH, NO,
IT'S NO RUSH AT ALL.

20:19.819 --> 20:22.689
REALLY. THERE'S...

20:22.722 --> 20:24.724
THERE'S NO RUSH.

20:30.863 --> 20:33.733
ARE YOUR PARENTS
STILL OUT?

20:33.766 --> 20:36.736
YES...

20:36.769 --> 20:38.771
YOU KNOW
THAT'S MY SHIRT.

20:38.805 --> 20:41.508
AND YOU'RE NEVER
GETTING IT BACK.

20:41.541 --> 20:43.510
I DON'T WANT IT BACK.

20:48.748 --> 20:51.318
YOU LOOK BETTER IN IT
THAN I DO.

20:55.288 --> 20:56.956
MMM.

20:56.989 --> 21:01.461
OKAY, I KNOW THAT
IT WAS MY IDEA TO WAIT...

21:01.494 --> 21:05.264
BUT RIGHT NOW
I'M JUST COMPLETELY
FORGETTING WHY.

21:13.005 --> 21:14.341
( sighs )

21:14.374 --> 21:18.244
YOU'LL REMEMBER
AFTER I PUT SOME CLOTHES ON.

21:19.612 --> 21:21.213
WHEW.

21:22.649 --> 21:26.419
( cell phone buzzing )
I AM SO HAPPY YOU GUYS

21:26.453 --> 21:29.221
DECIDED TO GO TO
THE LAKE HOUSE YESTERDAY.

21:29.255 --> 21:31.324
YEAH, ME TOO.

21:31.358 --> 21:36.596
I CAN'T IMAGINE WHAT
WENT THROUGH YOUR HEAD
WHEN YOUR MOM CALLED YOU.

21:39.131 --> 21:41.434
CAN WE NOT TALK ABOUT IT?

21:41.468 --> 21:44.704
JUST THE THOUGHT OF
SOMEBODY DOING THAT TO ALISON
IS REALLY--

21:44.737 --> 21:46.506
OF COURSE.

21:48.808 --> 21:50.076
MMM.

21:50.109 --> 21:52.011
I'LL CALL YOU LATER.

21:52.044 --> 21:54.113
YES, PLEASE.

22:06.759 --> 22:08.561
( bell rings )

22:08.595 --> 22:10.763
SO LET'S MEET UP AFTER
AND GO TO THE STORE TOGETHER.

22:10.797 --> 22:13.232
I CAN'T. I HAVE
AN APPOINTMENT WITH
DR. SULLIVAN.

22:13.265 --> 22:16.469
CAN YOU DO IT?
I THOUGH THE POINT OF COOKING
TOGETHER WAS BEING TOGETHER.

22:16.503 --> 22:21.674
IT IS AND I PROMISE,
WHEN I GET BACK WE WILL MAKE
AN UNFORGETTABLE DONG PO.

22:22.675 --> 22:24.511
SAY IT AGAIN.
NO!

22:24.544 --> 22:25.745
PLEASE!
NO.

22:25.778 --> 22:29.181
DO YOU WANT ME
TO GO TO THE STORE?

22:29.215 --> 22:31.117
( whispers )
 DONG PO.

22:31.150 --> 22:32.952
( chuckles )

22:32.985 --> 22:34.954
GIMME THE LIST.

22:42.228 --> 22:46.599
EVEN IF I SAY HIS NAME
WE GET SUCKED INTO THIS
VORTEX OF AWKWARDNESS.

22:46.633 --> 22:48.535
AND MY DAD PRETENDS
LIKE HE CAN'T HEAR,

22:48.568 --> 22:51.638
BUT HIS NECK GETS ALL RED
AND THEN HIS FACE PINCHES UP
LIKE HE'S CONSTIPATED.

22:51.671 --> 22:54.941
SO BASICALLY EZRA
IS LIKE LORD VOLDEMORT.

22:54.974 --> 22:55.942
HEY.
HEY.

22:57.544 --> 22:59.011
Spencer: HI, LUCAS.

23:02.148 --> 23:03.650
HE KNOWS SOMETHING.

23:03.683 --> 23:07.520
I THOUGHT YOU SAID
HE DIDN'T SEE YOU GUYS.
HE DIDN'T.

23:07.554 --> 23:11.390
IT'S NO COINCIDENCE
THAT HE TURNED DARK
AFTER THE MASQUERADE BALL.

23:11.424 --> 23:13.593
JENNA HAS THAT EFFECT
ON PEOPLE.

23:13.626 --> 23:15.695
YEAH, BUT SHE'S BEEN GONE
ALL SUMMER,

23:15.728 --> 23:17.630
AND HE'S STILL BOO RADLEY.

23:17.664 --> 23:21.668
HAVE YOU EVER NOTICED
HOW MANY SKINNY BRUNETTES
GO TO THIS SCHOOL?

23:21.701 --> 23:23.703
SHE FITS
THE COSTUME.

23:24.771 --> 23:27.574
HAS ANYBODY
HEARD FROM EMILY?

23:27.607 --> 23:29.676
NO. I LEFT HER
A BUNCH OF MESSAGES.

23:29.709 --> 23:31.077
YEAH, ME TOO.

23:31.110 --> 23:33.079
HOPE SHE'S OKAY.

23:59.271 --> 24:00.907
( lock not catching )

24:04.677 --> 24:06.813
( outside door opens )

24:08.748 --> 24:10.950
HELLO?

24:33.873 --> 24:35.842
HELP!

24:45.985 --> 24:46.586
ARIA? ARIA,
ARE YOU OKAY?

24:49.188 --> 24:52.058
(hyperventilating)
I HAD A PANIC ATTACK.

24:52.091 --> 24:54.661
YOU GUYS,
I THINK I SAW "A."

24:54.694 --> 24:55.962
NO, YOU DIDN'T, OKAY?

24:55.995 --> 24:58.965
MONA IS IN A STRAITJACKET
AT BRADLEY.

24:58.998 --> 25:03.836
YEAH, I HEARD THAT
SHE'S PRACTICALLY IN A COMA
OVER THERE.

25:03.870 --> 25:07.807
THAT GIRL INTERRUPTED THING
COULD JUST BE AN ACT TO
KEEP HER OUT OF JAIL.

25:07.840 --> 25:09.809
YOU KNOW WHAT
SHE'S CAPABLE OF,
WE ALL DO.

25:09.842 --> 25:13.179
YEAH, BUT SHE CAN'T
HURT US ANYMORE, OKAY?

25:13.212 --> 25:14.914
BITCH CRAZY.

25:14.947 --> 25:19.085
DON'T WORRY, ARIA.
SOMEDAY WE WILL ALL
HAVE JUBILATION.

25:19.118 --> 25:21.754
( laughs )

25:21.788 --> 25:25.357
THAT WAS A REALLY GOOD
USE OF THAT WORD, HANN.

25:32.632 --> 25:34.333
( footsteps )

25:35.434 --> 25:37.804
ARE YOU SURE
YOU DON'T WANT TO COME?

25:37.837 --> 25:41.007
YEAH, I JUST HAVE
ONE LAST TEST TO STUDY FOR.

25:41.040 --> 25:43.275
OH, IT'S A LONG WEEKEND,
HONEY.

25:43.309 --> 25:45.344
YOU CAN PUT IN HOURS TOMORROW.
I KNOW--

25:45.377 --> 25:47.246
( cell phone rings )

25:50.216 --> 25:52.318
I REALLY COULD USE
THE EXTRA DAY.

25:52.351 --> 25:55.688
COME ON, A GIRLS NIGHT OUT
IN THE CITY MIGHT BE FUN.

25:55.722 --> 25:57.323
LIKE OLD TIMES.

25:57.356 --> 25:59.759
BEFORE YOUR SISTER...

25:59.792 --> 26:03.395
MOM,
MELISSA IS A HASTINGS.

26:03.429 --> 26:05.898
WE BOUNCE BACK
LIKE SUPERBALLS.

26:08.935 --> 26:10.569
DON'T WORK TOO HARD.

26:10.603 --> 26:12.271
OKAY.

26:12.304 --> 26:14.641
BYE.
HAVE FUN.

26:16.442 --> 26:20.546
( door opens, closes )

26:26.018 --> 26:30.156
AW, YOU GAVE THIS TO ME
FOR MOTHER'S DAY.

26:30.189 --> 26:31.357
HMM.

26:32.591 --> 26:34.526
THIS POOR GIRL JUST CAN'T
GET ANY PEACE.

26:34.560 --> 26:38.197
MOM, I LOVE YOU,
BUT CAN WE PLEASE JUST
NOT TALK ABOUT ALISON?

26:38.230 --> 26:40.132
I NEED A BREAK FROM THAT.

26:47.539 --> 26:49.776
YOU KNOW, I WOULDN'T
TAKE ANY OF IT BACK,

26:49.809 --> 26:51.744
AND NEITHER WOULD YOUR FATHER.

26:51.778 --> 26:54.080
ARE YOU SURE
THIS IS WHAT YOU WANT?

26:54.113 --> 26:57.884
WHEN YOUR FATHER AND I MET,
WE WERE SO YOUNG.

26:57.917 --> 27:02.288
BUT AS LIFE GOT
MORE COMPLICATED...

27:02.321 --> 27:05.491
IT WAS JUST HARDER FOR US
TO FIND WAYS TO COMPROMISE.

27:05.524 --> 27:09.261
YOU'RE TALKING
ABOUT ME AND EZRA.
WE'RE THE COMPLICATION.

27:09.295 --> 27:12.965
NO. THAT IS JUST
ONE OF THE MANY ISSUES
WE COULDN'T AGREE ON.

27:12.999 --> 27:16.836
YEAH, BUT IT'S--
IT'S THE ONE THAT
DROVE YOU TWO APART.

27:16.869 --> 27:19.405
THAT IS ABSOLUTELY NOT TRUE.

27:19.438 --> 27:21.407
WE'RE JUST TOO DIFFERENT NOW.

27:21.440 --> 27:26.112
AND THAT'S OKAY.
I DON'T WANT TO PRETEND
TO BE SOMEBODY THAT I'M NOT,

27:26.145 --> 27:28.915
AND YOUR FATHER
SHOULDN'T HAVE TO EITHER.

27:30.917 --> 27:33.319
REMEMBER WHEN I WAS THIRTEEN

27:33.352 --> 27:36.689
AND YOU TOOK ME
TO THAT GROWN-UP LUNCH

27:36.723 --> 27:39.826
AND YOU...
YOU MADE ME A PROMISE

27:39.859 --> 27:41.794
TO ALLOW ME TO BE ME.

27:41.828 --> 27:43.495
OF COURSE.

27:43.529 --> 27:45.564
MOM, YOU'RE DOING THAT.

27:45.597 --> 27:50.502
BY NOT SHUTTING OUT EZRA,
YOU'RE ALLOWING ME TO BE
WHO I WANT TO BE.

27:50.536 --> 27:54.373
WELL, I HAVEN'T EXACTLY
WELCOMED HIM WITH OPEN ARMS.

27:54.406 --> 27:57.977
NO. BUT YOU DON'T CRINGE
WHEN I SAY HIS NAME.

27:58.010 --> 28:00.146
OR LOOK CONSTIPATED
LIKE YOUR FATHER DOES.

28:00.179 --> 28:04.016
YOU NOTICED THAT TOO?
YEAH. (laughs)

28:06.786 --> 28:09.355
( rock music plays
in background )

28:17.329 --> 28:18.564
HEY.

28:19.598 --> 28:21.033
HEY.

28:21.067 --> 28:24.303
YOU LOOK GREAT, EM.

28:24.336 --> 28:26.072
YOU REALLY DO.

28:27.073 --> 28:29.308
YOU LOOK HAPPY.

28:29.341 --> 28:30.910
I AM.

28:30.943 --> 28:33.212
I'M SORRY IF I TOOK YOU
AWAY FROM SPENCER.

28:33.245 --> 28:36.048
IT'S A HOLIDAY WEEKEND,
I'M SURE YOU GUYS HAD PLANS.

28:36.082 --> 28:38.918
IT'S OKAY. SHE'S GOT
ONE LAST TEST, SO...

28:38.951 --> 28:40.987
SHE'S STUDYING.
YEAH.

28:41.020 --> 28:42.254
THANKS, ANGIE.

28:44.123 --> 28:46.325
SO, WHEN DID YOU
MOVE UPSTAIRS?

28:46.358 --> 28:50.129
I STARTED THE REMODEL
A FEW WEEKS AGO.

28:50.162 --> 28:51.663
I MEAN,
IT'S STILL ROUGHING IT,

28:51.697 --> 28:55.234
BUT I GET TO LIVE FOR FREE
WHILE I DO THE WORK.

28:55.267 --> 28:59.038
AND IT FEELS REALLY GOOD
TO BE OUT ON MY OWN.

29:03.542 --> 29:04.811
HOW'S JENNA?

29:04.844 --> 29:07.613
I HAVEN'T TALKED TO HER
SINCE SHE LEFT TOWN.

29:10.249 --> 29:12.484
ARE YOU OKAY, EMILY?

29:14.486 --> 29:17.489
I DON'T--
I DON'T THINK I AM.

29:17.523 --> 29:19.591
IT'S ALL OVER THE NEWS.

29:19.625 --> 29:22.628
WHAT KIND OF A SICK PERSON
WOULD DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT?

29:25.431 --> 29:28.567
THERE'S SOMETHING
I NEED TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT.

29:45.351 --> 29:46.986
( car alarms chirps )

29:52.758 --> 29:54.626
( rustling )

30:54.186 --> 30:56.155
HOW WAS THE SHRINK?

30:56.188 --> 30:58.657
IT WAS FINE.

30:58.690 --> 31:00.960
WHAT DO YOU GUYS
TALK ABOUT?

31:00.993 --> 31:02.761
STUFF.

31:02.794 --> 31:04.330
DO YOU TALK ABOUT US?

31:04.363 --> 31:06.532
NO.

31:06.565 --> 31:08.634
HOW CAN YOU NOT
TALK ABOUT US?

31:08.667 --> 31:11.237
WE'RE INTIMATE.

31:11.270 --> 31:12.838
WE'RE WHAT?

31:12.871 --> 31:14.606
YEAH, LET'S JUST
FORGET THAT.

31:14.640 --> 31:15.975
YOU JUST SAID
THE "I" WORD.

31:16.008 --> 31:18.010
( cell phone rings )
YOU SHOULD GET THAT.

31:18.044 --> 31:20.512
I HAVE NEVER HEARD A GUY
SAY THE "I" WORD.

31:20.546 --> 31:22.281
( ringing )
HERE.

31:25.117 --> 31:28.354
WELL, YOU'RE SAVED.
IT'S SPENCER.

31:28.387 --> 31:31.390
WE HAVE TO TALK ABOUT
THIS POOL THING FOR TOMORROW.

31:34.093 --> 31:34.860
HELLO?

31:34.893 --> 31:36.728
IS MISS RIVERS AVAILABLE?

31:36.762 --> 31:38.730
HOW'D YOU GET MY NUMBER?

31:38.764 --> 31:42.101
I TOOK A CHANCE THAT
MISS RIVERS' EMERGENCY CONTACT
HARVEY MARIN

31:42.134 --> 31:44.070
MIGHT, IN FACT,
 BE HANNA MARIN.

31:44.103 --> 31:47.173
IS SOMETHING WRONG
 WITH MONA?
OTHER THAN THE OBVIOUS?

31:47.206 --> 31:50.076
IS THAT BRIT HUMOR?
BECAUSE IT'S NOT FUNNY.

31:50.109 --> 31:51.978
I'M SORRY, I HAVE
A VERY DRY SENSE OF HUMOR.

31:52.011 --> 31:53.679
CAN YOU JUST
CUT TO THE CHASE?

31:53.712 --> 31:55.247
MONA'S MAKING PROGRESS,

31:55.281 --> 31:57.549
AND HER DOCTOR THINKS THAT
YOUR VISITS MAY BE HELPING.

31:57.583 --> 31:59.185
WHAT KIND OF PROGRESS?

31:59.218 --> 32:01.687
YOU SHOULD COME BY TOMORROW
 AND SEE FOR YOURSELF.

32:01.720 --> 32:03.855
HEY.
EVERYTHING OKAY?

32:03.889 --> 32:08.160
SPENCER, I DON'T WANT TO EAT
RAW VEGGIES IF WE'RE HANGING OUT
IN BIKINIS ALL DAY.

32:08.194 --> 32:09.861
BUT CHIPS AND SALSA
SOUNDS GREAT!

32:09.895 --> 32:11.063
UH, PARDON?

32:11.097 --> 32:12.498
BYE, SPENCER.

32:13.765 --> 32:15.167
GOOD NIGHT.

32:18.971 --> 32:22.741
I SPENT HALF THE SUMMER
PARTYING WAY TOO MUCH.

32:22.774 --> 32:25.277
I'VE JUST BEEN SO ANGRY.

32:25.311 --> 32:28.347
EM, THAT'S UNDERSTANDABLE.

32:28.380 --> 32:32.251
I CAN'T IMAGINE
LOSING SOMEONE THAT WAY.

32:34.086 --> 32:36.888
I WAS AT THIS ONE PARTY
AND I GOT SO WASTED

32:36.922 --> 32:38.824
I DON'T EVEN
REMEMBER BEING THERE.

32:38.857 --> 32:40.592
YOU DON'T REMEMBER ANYTHING?

32:42.661 --> 32:44.563
I REALLY LET MY FRIENDS DOWN.

32:44.596 --> 32:46.465
YOU KNOW HOW
SPENCER AND THE GIRLS
FEEL ABOUT YOU.

32:46.498 --> 32:47.899
YEAH, BUT THEY'RE
LIKE MY FAMILY.

32:47.933 --> 32:50.136
THAT'S WHY I CAN'T STAND
TO DISAPPOINT THEM.

32:50.169 --> 32:54.306
THAT'S WHAT'S SO GREAT
ABOUT FRIENDS--
THEY'RE NOT YOUR FAMILY.

32:54.340 --> 32:57.343
THEY ACCEPT YOU
FOR WHO YOU ARE.

33:16.628 --> 33:18.464
( typing )

33:19.198 --> 33:21.700
( cell phone rings )

33:22.368 --> 33:24.836
( ringing )

33:28.774 --> 33:30.576
I'M LISTENING.

33:45.023 --> 33:48.194
ARIA,
THE POLICE ARE HERE.

33:53.665 --> 33:55.367
WE WENT TO SPENCER'S LAKE HOUSE.
WE MADE A FIRE AND EMILY SHOWED
US PICTURES FROM HER TRIP.

33:58.270 --> 34:00.272
WE SPENT THE EVENING
CATCHING UP.

34:00.306 --> 34:02.574
IT WAS A PRETTY LOW-KEY NIGHT.

34:02.608 --> 34:06.011
I'LL CALL YOU
WHEN WE GET HOME. OKAY.

34:06.044 --> 34:08.514
ARE THEY CHARGING THEM?
NO, IT'S JUST ROUTINE.

34:08.547 --> 34:10.416
THE GIRLS WERE AT
YOUR LAKE HOUSE LAST NIGHT.

34:10.449 --> 34:12.083
I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHY THEY'RE BEING QUESTIONED.

34:12.118 --> 34:14.753
THEY SAID IT WAS PART OF
THE ONGOING INVESTIGATION.

34:14.786 --> 34:16.487
AND YOU BELIEVE THAT?

34:17.889 --> 34:19.690
UH, EXCUSE ME.

34:21.059 --> 34:22.828
HAVE YOU SEEN HER?
IS SHE OKAY?

34:22.860 --> 34:24.630
SHE HASN'T COME OUT YET.

34:24.663 --> 34:26.132
LOOK, I GET WHY YOU'RE HERE,

34:26.165 --> 34:27.632
AND I'M SURE
SHE'D APPRECIATE IT,

34:27.666 --> 34:29.368
BUT I THINK THE LAST THING
SHE NEEDS RIGHT NOW

34:29.400 --> 34:32.771
IS THE POLICE QUESTIONING
HER RELATIONSHIP WITH
A FORMER TEACHER.

34:32.804 --> 34:35.574
I THOUGHT
WE WERE PAST THIS.

34:43.149 --> 34:45.217
ARE YOU OKAY?
DO I NEED TO TALK TO THEM?

34:45.251 --> 34:47.553
NO, I'M FINE. I JUST
WANT TO GET OUT OF HERE.

34:47.585 --> 34:49.621
WE COULD STILL MAKE
OUR RESERVATION.

34:51.623 --> 34:53.992
OR MAYBE WE COULD
DO THIS ANOTHER TIME?

34:55.327 --> 34:59.598
I'M SURE WE COULD ALL
USE A BITE, RIGHT?

35:00.899 --> 35:04.303
YES. UM, LET'S GO.

35:11.377 --> 35:13.979
THEY'VE HAD YOU ON
A LOT OF MEDICATION,

35:14.012 --> 35:16.548
SO I DON'T KNOW
IF YOU REMEMBER,

35:16.582 --> 35:20.719
BUT I'VE BEEN VISITING YOU
FOR A COUPLE OF WEEKS NOW.

35:22.521 --> 35:25.791
REMEMBER THAT CUTE DOCTOR
FROM ROSEWOOD MEMORIAL?

35:25.824 --> 35:28.294
THE ONE WHO WAS ENGAGED
TO SPENCER'S SISTER?

35:30.896 --> 35:33.532
OF COURSE YOU DO.
YOU'RE "A."

35:36.702 --> 35:40.306
WELL, HE THINKS MY VISITS
HAVE BEEN HELPING YOU...

35:40.339 --> 35:44.510
SO IF YOU WANT,
I CAN KEEP COMING BACK.

35:46.712 --> 35:48.980
IS IT SOMETHING YOU WANT?

36:28.119 --> 36:30.389
COULD HAVE BEEN YOU
BEHIND THIS GLASS.

36:30.422 --> 36:34.526
THE COPS WERE SO CLOSE
TO PINNING IT ON YOU.

36:34.560 --> 36:38.964
I'M SORRY I HAD TO
KEEP CALLING YOU LIKE THAT.

36:38.997 --> 36:41.767
I KNOW WHAT YOU THINK OF ME...

36:41.800 --> 36:44.836
BUT I SWEAR TO YOU,
I DIDN'T DO IT.

36:44.870 --> 36:48.340
ALL OF THE EVIDENCE
THEY HAVE AGAINST ME,
IT'S BOGUS.

36:48.374 --> 36:51.643
YOU SAID THAT
YOU WOULD TELL ME THE TRUTH.

36:51.677 --> 36:52.778
SO WHAT IS IT?

36:52.811 --> 36:55.914
THERE'S A LOT
YOU DON'T KNOW, SPENCER.

36:55.947 --> 36:58.384
SOME OF IT
YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW.

36:58.417 --> 37:02.521
DO YOU THINK THERE'S ANY CHANCE
I'M GONNA GET A FAIR TRIAL
IN THIS TOWN?

37:02.554 --> 37:04.890
EVERYBODY ALREADY THINKS
I'M GUILTY.

37:04.923 --> 37:07.158
I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT MAYA,

37:07.192 --> 37:10.562
BUT I MAY KNOW
WHO KILLED ALISON.

37:13.031 --> 37:14.866
I'M LISTENING.

37:14.900 --> 37:19.037
I NEED A LAWYER,
AND YOUR MOM'S ONE OF
THE BEST IN THE STATE.

37:19.070 --> 37:21.106
NO. I'M NOT GOING TO HELP YOU.

37:21.139 --> 37:23.942
YOU'RE NOT SAFE, SPENCER,
AND YOUR FRIENDS AREN'T EITHER.

37:23.975 --> 37:25.611
YOU'RE JUST
TRYING TO SCARE ME.

37:25.644 --> 37:29.315
IT'S NOT OVER!
DO YOU HEAR ME?

37:29.348 --> 37:31.383
I KNOW WHO TOOK THE BODY!

37:57.409 --> 38:00.011
( cell phone beeps )

38:01.980 --> 38:03.949
( car starts )

38:13.559 --> 38:14.960
I'LL TRY ONE MORE TIME.

38:14.993 --> 38:16.294
WHY WASN'T SHE
AT THE POLICE STATION?

38:16.328 --> 38:18.296
DO YOU THINK
SHE TOLD 'EM THE TRUTH?

38:18.330 --> 38:21.900
IF SHE TOLD 'EM THE TRUTH,
WE WOULDN'T BE STANDING HERE.

38:21.933 --> 38:25.504
( knock at door,
cell phone ringing )

38:28.774 --> 38:31.042
EM, THAT WAS ME CALLING YOU.
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

38:31.076 --> 38:33.945
IT'S OKAY. IF YOU
TOLD THEM THE TRUTH,
WE'LL FIGURE SOMETHING OUT.

38:33.979 --> 38:36.214
NO, I WOULD NEVER
DO THAT TO YOU GUYS.

38:36.247 --> 38:37.983
THEY CALLED ALL THREE OF US
INTO THE STATION.

38:38.016 --> 38:40.085
WHERE WERE YOU?
WE WERE SO WORRIED.

38:40.118 --> 38:42.087
I DIDN'T HAVE MY PHONE
WITH ME YESTERDAY.

38:42.120 --> 38:44.255
AND WHEN I GOT HOME LAST NIGHT,
THE COPS WERE WAITING FOR ME.

38:44.289 --> 38:46.992
BUT I TOLD THEM EVERYTHING
THAT WE AGREED ON. EVERYTHING.

38:47.025 --> 38:49.461
THEN WHY ARE YOU SO UPSET?
BECAUSE IF IT WASN'T FOR ME,

38:49.495 --> 38:51.830
WE WOULDN'T BE AT
THE WRONG PLACE
AT THE WRONG TIME,

38:51.863 --> 38:53.432
AND IT COULD
HAUNT US FOREVER.

38:53.465 --> 38:56.134
EM, IT'S FINE. OKAY?
WE'VE DEALT WITH IT.

38:56.167 --> 38:57.903
I SAW YOU GUYS
AT SCHOOL YESTERDAY,

38:57.936 --> 38:59.938
AND ALL I COULD THINK ABOUT
WAS BECAUSE OF ME--

38:59.971 --> 39:02.608
BECAUSE OF YOU, NOTHING.
OKAY? NOBODY SAW US,

39:02.641 --> 39:06.244
AND IF WE JUST
STICK TO OUR STORY,
WE ARE IN THE CLEAR.

39:07.679 --> 39:12.150
I REMEMBERED SOMETHING...
ABOUT THAT NIGHT.

39:22.093 --> 39:24.630
THAT'S IT?
THAT'S ALL YOU REMEMBER?

39:24.663 --> 39:26.832
I FOUND OUT ONLINE
THAT SOME PEOPLE FORGET THINGS

39:26.865 --> 39:28.434
BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT
TO REMEMBER.

39:28.467 --> 39:31.503
AND IF THIS IS SELECTIVE,
THEN ANYTHING CAN TRIGGER IT--

39:31.537 --> 39:32.638
SIGHTS, SMELLS, SOUNDS.

39:32.671 --> 39:34.706
SO THE CAR THAT YOU SAW,

39:34.740 --> 39:37.843
IT JUST LOOKED LIKE
THE CAR FROM THAT NIGHT,
OR IT WAS THE CAR?

39:37.876 --> 39:39.377
I DON'T KNOW.

39:39.411 --> 39:42.748
I STARTED TO TALK TOWARDS IT
BECAUSE I WANTED TO LOOK INSIDE,

39:42.781 --> 39:44.850
BUT...I GOT A TEXT.

39:44.883 --> 39:48.420
AND THE PERSON
THAT SENT IT TO ME KNOWS
I DON'T REMEMBER WHAT HAPPENED.

39:50.856 --> 39:52.524
"I BET YOU REMEMBER ME."

39:52.558 --> 39:54.359
GUYS,
IS IT STARTING AGAIN?

39:54.392 --> 39:56.995
NO. YOU GUYS,
THAT'S NOT "A."

39:57.028 --> 40:01.099
MONA IS "A,"
AND SHE'S DROOLING IN HER BED
AT A NUT HOSPITAL.

40:01.132 --> 40:04.102
WE DON'T KNOW THAT
FOR SURE.

40:04.135 --> 40:06.104
YEAH, WE DO.

40:06.137 --> 40:07.973
I'VE BEEN VISITING HER.

40:08.006 --> 40:09.641
WHAT?
WHAT?
WHAT?

40:09.675 --> 40:11.677
I DIDN'T TELL YOU BECAUSE
I KNEW YOU'D THINK I'M CRAZY.

40:11.710 --> 40:13.845
YEAH.
SHE TRIED TO KILL YOU, HANNA.

40:13.879 --> 40:17.148
SHE'S LOCKED UP IN A ROOM
WITH BARS OVER HER WINDOWS.

40:17.182 --> 40:21.286
TRUST ME,
SHE DOESN'T KNOW ANYTHING
THAT HAPPENED THAT NIGHT.

40:21.319 --> 40:24.055
YEAH, WELL, SOMEONE DOES.

40:25.924 --> 40:29.528
THERE'S SOMETHING
I NEED TO SHOW YOU GUYS.

40:39.871 --> 40:43.041
ALI'S SHRINE
IS RIGHT OVER THERE...

40:43.074 --> 40:48.313
AND THEN OVER HERE
SHE HAD A ROW OF BLACK HOODIES
ALL JUST PERFECTLY HANGING,

40:48.346 --> 40:51.116
READY FOR "A"
TO GRAB ONE AND RUN.
Hanna: MONA.

40:51.149 --> 40:53.785
READY FOR MONA.

40:53.819 --> 40:55.453
YEAH.

40:55.487 --> 40:58.456
AND THERE WAS A ZOMBIE COSTUME
HANGING ON THE BACK
OF THAT DOOR.

40:58.490 --> 41:00.692
JUST LIKE THE ONE THAT
ATTACKED ALI ON HALLOWEEN.

41:00.726 --> 41:03.161
O-OKAY, SO YOU'VE BEEN
COMING HERE ALL SUMMER

41:03.194 --> 41:06.031
TRYING TO REMEMBER
WHAT WAS IN THIS ROOM. WHY?

41:07.298 --> 41:09.935
WE HAVE TO
TELL EMILY THE TRUTH.

41:12.904 --> 41:16.207
THE MORNING AFTER
THEY FOUND MONA'S BODY,
WE CAME BACK HERE.

41:16.241 --> 41:19.477
YEAH, TO GET RID OF EVERYTHING.
I KNOW. YOU TOLD ME.

41:19.511 --> 41:21.780
WE LIED TO YOU.

41:21.813 --> 41:25.517
WE DIDN'T WANT IT TO BE ANOTHER
THING YOU HAD TO WORRY ABOUT.

41:25.551 --> 41:28.554
WHEN WE CAME BACK HERE,
IT WAS EMPTY.

41:28.587 --> 41:31.389
THE FILE CABINETS,
THE MAPS, PICTURES,

41:31.422 --> 41:33.725
ALI'S DIARIES--
EVERYTHING WAS GONE.

41:33.759 --> 41:35.761
MAYBE THE POLICE TOOK IT.

41:35.794 --> 41:39.197
IF THE POLICE FOUND OUT
WHAT MONA KNOWS ABOUT US,
MY MOM WOULD BE IN JAIL.

41:39.230 --> 41:40.431
YEAH, EZRA TOO.

41:40.465 --> 41:41.867
SO WHO TOOK IT?

41:41.900 --> 41:44.335
THERE ARE THINGS THAT
DON'T REALLY ADD UP.

41:44.369 --> 41:47.272
LIKE MONA WAS WITH YOU WHEN
"A" GAVE EMILY THAT MASSAGE.

41:47.305 --> 41:49.440
AND THERE'S NO WAY THAT
SHE COULD HAVE GOTTEN
IAN'S BODY

41:49.474 --> 41:51.276
OUT OF THE BELL TOWER
BY HERSELF.

41:51.309 --> 41:55.947
WAIT. YOU'RE SAYING THAT YOU
THINK SOMEONE WAS HELPING HER?

41:59.317 --> 42:01.787
IF THE BLACK SWAN
WASN'T GUILTY OF SOMETHING,

42:01.820 --> 42:04.322
WHY WOULD SHE
RUN FROM YOU GUYS?

42:06.257 --> 42:08.894
( distant car alarm )

42:14.299 --> 42:16.301
( car alarm blaring )

42:18.937 --> 42:20.806
( alarm chirps off )

42:55.641 --> 42:58.076
( cell phone beeping )

42:58.109 --> 43:00.445
( cell phones chime )

43:04.783 --> 43:09.187
"MONA PLAYED WITH DOLLS.
I PLAY WITH BODY PARTS."

43:09.955 --> 43:11.623
"GAME ON, BITCHES."

43:11.657 --> 43:13.224
All: "A."

43:13.258 --> 43:18.596
* YOU CAN'T TURN BACK
 THE HANDS OF TIME *

43:18.630 --> 43:24.602
* JUST LET IT GO
 AND YOU'LL BE FINE *

43:24.636 --> 43:30.642
* WHAT'S DONE IS DONE
 AND IT'S ALL RIGHT *

43:30.676 --> 43:37.448
* YOU CAN'T TURN BACK
 THE HANDS OF TIME *
