01:08.693 --> 01:10.820

01:11.738 --> 01:14.491

{\an8}- Ooh, mirror balloons! Cool!

01:17.410 --> 01:20.371
{\an8}- Katie, you've got to
hold on to the balloons.

01:24.250 --> 01:26.836
- Ooh, mirror balloons! Cool!

01:27.921 --> 01:30.006
- Diego, uh, what
did you do to Katie?

01:30.089 --> 01:31.841
- Nothing.
- Are you sure?

01:31.925 --> 01:33.593
- Her hair's, like...

01:33.676 --> 01:36.179
frozen or something.

01:36.262 --> 01:39.265
- Ooh, mirror balloons! Cool!

01:39.349 --> 01:40.600
- Well, I didn't do it.

01:40.683 --> 01:41.976
Maybe it's a hip,
new hair thing.

01:42.060 --> 01:43.394
- [gasps]
There's a hip, new hair thing

01:43.478 --> 01:45.271
that I don't know about?

01:45.355 --> 01:46.731
- Try "Coldilocks."

01:46.815 --> 01:48.191
It's a fairy tale.

01:48.274 --> 01:49.275
- Hang on.

01:49.359 --> 01:51.820
There's something
very wrong here.

01:52.821 --> 01:55.323
How could you go
to the salon without me?

01:58.493 --> 02:01.663
- So word is Daniel's
got something special planned

02:01.746 --> 02:02.872
for you tonight.

02:02.956 --> 02:04.123
- Maybe.

02:04.207 --> 02:05.416
- Spill.

02:05.500 --> 02:06.918
- I don't know what it is.

02:07.001 --> 02:10.003
But it's so cute the way
he always wants to surprise me.

02:10.088 --> 02:12.340
- Ugh, want some crackers
with that cheese?

02:12.423 --> 02:14.467
- Make as much fun
as you want.

02:14.551 --> 02:16.469
I'll still think
it's totes adorbs.

02:16.553 --> 02:18.429
- Oh, my gosh, did he think
it was totes adorbs

02:18.513 --> 02:22.016
when you told him about
spending the day with Jax?

02:22.100 --> 02:23.643
DIEGO: Gigi!

02:24.811 --> 02:27.313
Could you stop blogging
for one second?

02:27.397 --> 02:28.606
- Stop blogging?

02:28.690 --> 02:31.109
That's like asking me
to stop breathing.

02:31.192 --> 02:32.902
I can't believe my own brother
would say that to me.

02:32.986 --> 02:33.653
- Okay, I'm sorry,
but you're supposed to be

02:33.736 --> 02:35.780
in charge of this party,

02:35.864 --> 02:36.781
and yet I did
all the organizing--

02:36.865 --> 02:39.033
the supplies ordering--

02:39.117 --> 02:40.410
- I ordered supplies.

02:40.493 --> 02:41.744
- Yeah, like what?

02:41.828 --> 02:43.830
- Like...

02:43.913 --> 02:44.998
that.

02:45.081 --> 02:47.500
The Misinformation logo
ice sculpture is here.

02:47.584 --> 02:49.544
- The what?
- Wait, Diego!

02:51.880 --> 02:53.673
- Come on, girls,
let's get going.

02:53.756 --> 02:55.258
- But we just got here.

02:55.341 --> 02:56.342
- We've been here for hours.

02:56.426 --> 02:59.596
- Yeah. I was in the pool
for so long,

02:59.679 --> 03:01.681
my fingers turned into prunes.

03:05.435 --> 03:06.436
- Maddie, wait.
Are you leaving?

03:06.519 --> 03:07.937
- Yeah.

03:08.021 --> 03:10.189
- But we just got here.

03:10.273 --> 03:12.108
- The party isn't starting
for five hours.

03:12.191 --> 03:14.485
- [gasps]
Five hours?

03:14.569 --> 03:15.653
We'll never be ready in time.

03:15.737 --> 03:16.654
We have to hurry.

03:16.738 --> 03:18.781
- All right,
so pick you up at 4:00?

03:18.865 --> 03:21.659
- Uh, that's okay.

03:21.743 --> 03:22.911
[chuckles]
I'll just meet you back here.

03:22.994 --> 03:25.788
- Oh...
[chuckles]

03:25.872 --> 03:26.789
That's right.

03:26.873 --> 03:28.583
You like to be
fashionably late.

03:28.666 --> 03:30.668
I guess I could sneak away
and just pick you up later.

03:30.752 --> 03:32.295
- No! I mean...

03:32.378 --> 03:36.299
You still have
so much work to do here.

03:36.382 --> 03:37.884
- Are you trying to keep me away
because of your mom?

03:37.967 --> 03:41.220
- Pshh!
Ha ha ha! No.

03:42.639 --> 03:43.056
Sort of.

03:43.139 --> 03:45.391
- Ow. Oh.

03:45.475 --> 03:46.643
- Yeah.

03:46.726 --> 03:47.810
- I don't get it.

03:47.894 --> 03:48.978
Just because I'm a Kanay?

03:49.062 --> 03:50.647
- No, because
our plan backfired,

03:50.730 --> 03:53.024
and you soaked her
in Papaya de la Playa.

03:53.107 --> 03:54.943
- Oh, that.

03:55.026 --> 03:56.152
- Don't worry about her.

03:56.235 --> 03:58.321
I like you,
and that's what counts.

03:59.572 --> 04:01.908
Now, I'll see you
at the party.

04:01.991 --> 04:03.493
Come on, girls, let's go.

04:03.576 --> 04:04.327
- But we just got here.

04:04.410 --> 04:06.371
- What is the matter with you?

04:09.749 --> 04:11.668
MIA: Ready?

04:11.751 --> 04:12.335
- Ready for what?

04:12.418 --> 04:15.171
- Ready to arm wrestle.

04:15.254 --> 04:16.964
Bet ya I could take you down.

04:17.048 --> 04:18.132
- Yeah, right.

04:18.216 --> 04:20.259
- Come on, it'll be fun.

04:20.343 --> 04:23.429
Or are you insecure
about your chicken arms?

04:24.639 --> 04:27.058
- I do not have chicken arms.

04:27.141 --> 04:30.520
It's just--
we got to pay attention.

04:30.603 --> 04:32.355
- [squawking like chicken]
- All right, it's on!

04:33.439 --> 04:37.318
- Jacob, you're
too far from shore!

04:43.908 --> 04:45.034
- You're too far out!

04:45.118 --> 04:46.494
Swim closer to shore!

04:46.577 --> 04:48.538
I'm talking to you, Jacob!

04:48.621 --> 04:49.330
- See, I told you!

04:51.499 --> 04:52.083
- Back to business.

04:52.166 --> 04:54.210
- Maybe some other time.

04:54.293 --> 04:56.045
We shouldn't mess around
while we're on duty.

04:56.129 --> 04:57.547
- Are you always
this responsible?

04:57.630 --> 04:59.632
- No...

04:59.716 --> 05:01.718
Yeah.

05:01.801 --> 05:02.927
Speaking of which...

05:06.723 --> 05:10.018
- Take your seats
for your final exam.

05:10.810 --> 05:11.436
Quickly!

05:17.650 --> 05:21.779
The tests are tailored
to each one of you.

05:21.863 --> 05:25.616
So, please
don't bother copying.

05:36.002 --> 05:38.796
I have all your powers here.

05:38.880 --> 05:40.590
When you're finished
with the test,

05:40.673 --> 05:41.424
place it on the desk,

05:41.507 --> 05:44.260
and then take your powers back.

05:44.343 --> 05:47.055
And then meet me
at Council headquarters.

05:47.138 --> 05:49.891
You have exactly 60 minutes,

05:49.974 --> 05:51.434
and in that time,

05:51.517 --> 05:54.312
this tray
and any remaining powers on it

05:54.395 --> 05:56.314
will disappear.

05:56.397 --> 05:57.398
[chuckles]

05:57.482 --> 05:59.442
And remember,

05:59.525 --> 06:02.111
if you do not finish your tests,

06:02.195 --> 06:05.782
you will lose your powers...

06:05.865 --> 06:06.783
forever.

06:06.866 --> 06:10.703
[laughing]

06:10.787 --> 06:12.622
No pressure! Good luck!

06:12.705 --> 06:14.082

06:17.043 --> 06:19.420
- You've been working on that
fruit platter for an hour.

06:19.504 --> 06:21.964
- Yeah, I know,
but totally worth it.

06:22.048 --> 06:23.591
Look, check it out.

06:23.674 --> 06:26.135
- Wow, awesome!

06:26.219 --> 06:28.304
Have you been crafting
in your free time?

06:28.387 --> 06:30.056
- What, no?
This isn't crafting.

06:30.139 --> 06:31.724
This is...

06:31.808 --> 06:33.643

06:33.726 --> 06:34.560
- Mm-hmm.

06:34.644 --> 06:35.812

06:39.524 --> 06:41.317
- No, uh, Emma did.

06:41.400 --> 06:42.568
- Mm-hmm.
- Come on, let's go get ready.

06:49.909 --> 06:51.577
- And... 90 seconds.

06:51.661 --> 06:52.787
Go!

06:55.790 --> 06:57.917
- Wait, I feel like...

06:58.000 --> 06:59.001
we're being watched.

06:59.085 --> 07:00.670
Oh, um, hey, guys.

07:00.753 --> 07:04.048
We're just helping cousin Diego
set up for the party.

07:04.132 --> 07:07.718
- Yeah, setting up for a prank.

07:07.802 --> 07:09.387
- Oh, I don't like this.

07:09.470 --> 07:10.429
What if they put
the video online

07:10.513 --> 07:14.225
and the fuzz sees it,
or they copy it?

07:14.308 --> 07:16.102
Or worse... Mom.

07:16.185 --> 07:18.604
I've got it under control.

07:18.688 --> 07:20.565
Time to activate
the anti-spy countermeasures.

- It's sweet!
- It's honey.

07:41.752 --> 07:45.047
- Oh, it's an honor
to be your brother.

07:45.131 --> 07:47.049
- That fake beehive is
one of the best investments

07:47.133 --> 07:48.634
we have ever made.

07:48.718 --> 07:49.677
- All the scariness
of a real one

07:49.760 --> 07:52.305
with none of
the hard maintenance.

08:09.822 --> 08:11.407
- It's done.

08:11.490 --> 08:14.035
I suspect Mr. Novoa
will be bidding farewell

08:14.118 --> 08:15.077
to his powers shortly.

08:15.161 --> 08:17.413
- It's about time.

08:17.496 --> 08:21.209
I've always knew that
"Novoa" was "no good."

08:21.292 --> 08:23.753
[both laughing]
See what I did there?

08:23.836 --> 08:26.714
I used the "No" from his name,
and I put it in--

08:26.797 --> 08:27.757
Yeah, I got it.

08:29.967 --> 08:31.093
I think you're wrong.

08:31.177 --> 08:32.678
He just needs a little time
to grow up.

08:32.761 --> 08:35.556
- I never tried to destroy
the Realm as Mr. Novoa has.

08:35.640 --> 08:36.974
- But that test you gave him
was impossible.

08:37.058 --> 08:38.267
- [laughing]

08:38.351 --> 08:41.062
That test is irrelevant.

08:41.145 --> 08:43.773
All he has to do

08:43.856 --> 08:46.359
is try not to steal his powers.

08:46.442 --> 08:48.694
- Ha!
What could be easier?

08:48.778 --> 08:51.280
- Uh, it doesn't sound
so easy to me.

08:51.364 --> 08:53.407
It sounds like you
set him up to fail.

08:57.203 --> 08:57.536
- [sighs]

09:02.833 --> 09:03.960
Still not done?

09:04.043 --> 09:06.462
- Uh, you know, just a--
just a couple more left.

09:06.545 --> 09:08.548
- Yeah, better hurry.
You heard Agamemnon.

09:08.631 --> 09:11.592
That clock hits zero, and you
can say good-bye to your powers.
