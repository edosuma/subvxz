00:46.760 --> 00:48.550
Mommy?

01:03.270 --> 01:05.239
Mommy?

01:24.460 --> 01:26.150
Police!

01:26.400 --> 01:28.590
- Jake, come on!
- All right, children.

01:28.760 --> 01:30.250
Come on. Come on.

01:33.900 --> 01:37.960
What's going on? Oh, my God!
Where are my kids? Where are my kids?

01:39.510 --> 01:40.910
What's going on?

01:41.080 --> 01:43.700
Oh, my God! We got kids in here!

01:43.880 --> 01:45.870
- Control that dog!
- I'm trying.

01:46.250 --> 01:48.720
- Where are you taking us?
- Into that car.

01:48.880 --> 01:50.610
What was going on in that garage?

01:50.790 --> 01:53.120
- They was cooking something.
- It smelled bad.

01:53.290 --> 01:55.120
Medicine.

01:58.160 --> 01:59.630
I had nothing to do with it!

01:59.800 --> 02:02.130
- Do you know who this is?
- That's our mom!

02:03.430 --> 02:06.420
- Call welfare for these kids.
- We're already on welfare.

02:06.600 --> 02:08.930
Look, we don't know
who these people are.

02:09.100 --> 02:12.040
My mom has nothing to do with them.
We just stayed here.

02:12.340 --> 02:15.740
- Are they gonna put us in jail, Mom?
- What? No.

02:16.480 --> 02:20.680
No, they're not gonna put us in jail.
They're just trying to help. Right?

02:20.850 --> 02:24.080
Please, I don't want my kids
to see me like this. Please.

02:24.250 --> 02:27.150
- You handle this.
- We've got no one to look after them.

02:27.320 --> 02:29.950
- We won't cause any trouble.
- Get in the car.

02:30.590 --> 02:33.220
Get those kids out of here now. Now.

02:33.400 --> 02:35.020
- Okay.
- Now!

02:35.200 --> 02:36.990
Come on. Come on.

02:37.630 --> 02:40.000
No dog! No dog!

02:44.610 --> 02:46.870
- Get in the car!
- No.

02:47.040 --> 02:50.410
- Gracie, are you gonna help me or what?
- Mom!

02:50.580 --> 02:54.380
Down, boy, down. Lay down, boy.

02:54.550 --> 02:56.450
Gracie!

02:56.620 --> 02:59.780
- Get in the car!
- I love you.

03:14.770 --> 03:16.960
Come on, Spike. You can do it.

03:17.140 --> 03:20.540
Come on. Don't slow down.
Come on, Spike!

03:20.710 --> 03:22.340
Faster, Spike!

03:22.510 --> 03:25.480
- Come on! Come on, Spike!
- Speed up! Don't give up!

03:25.650 --> 03:28.120
Come on, boy!

03:50.640 --> 03:54.540
Okay, everybody duck.
You too, Rose.

03:56.380 --> 03:58.780
I thought we weren't stopping
until Grandma's.

03:58.950 --> 04:01.110
I am not in the mood.

04:04.090 --> 04:06.110
Let's make this good.

04:06.620 --> 04:09.560
It's just me and my daughter.

04:10.830 --> 04:14.780
I will have the money for you in the
morning. I swear on a stack of Bibles.

04:14.960 --> 04:17.190
- No credit card?
- Credit card?

04:17.370 --> 04:21.269
I'm lucky to have the clothes on my ba...
These aren't even my clothes.

04:21.440 --> 04:24.630
They're my neighbor's.
Oh, God. I must look like hell.

04:24.810 --> 04:27.140
What exactly happened?

04:27.810 --> 04:31.470
This crapped-out guy next door
was smoking and burned the place down.

04:31.650 --> 04:33.110
Can you believe?

04:33.280 --> 04:37.150
Our grandmother says that she's coming
tomorrow with money and clothes.

04:37.320 --> 04:38.750
How early will she be here?

04:38.920 --> 04:41.650
- Very early.
- Crack of dawn, man.

04:41.820 --> 04:43.260
What time do you get up?

04:43.430 --> 04:46.550
- Why?
- Because we wanna cook you breakfast.

04:48.000 --> 04:50.560
Cook me breakfast?
Why would you do that?

04:50.730 --> 04:52.600
Because you deserve it.

04:52.770 --> 04:55.170
Because you're a sensitive man.

04:55.600 --> 04:58.970
And not many people see that.
But who does?

04:59.140 --> 05:01.010
- We do.
- We do.

05:08.850 --> 05:10.650
I wish I had long hair like you.

05:13.760 --> 05:17.520
My hair used to be longer than this.
It used to be down to my butt.

05:20.000 --> 05:22.330
When you were young
and lived in Wyoming?

05:22.500 --> 05:24.520
Yeah, when I was young.

05:25.630 --> 05:27.300
Well, you still are young, Mom.

05:27.900 --> 05:32.430
- That's what I like to hear.
- Yeah, Mom. Tell us about Shamire.

05:32.610 --> 05:35.010
Oh, Shamire.

05:35.180 --> 05:39.910
Shamire was the most beautiful horse
in the world.

05:40.080 --> 05:42.520
- Arabian.
- All white, huh?

05:42.680 --> 05:45.450
Oh, honey, he was pale.
He was a ghost.

05:45.620 --> 05:49.490
- You rode bareback like an Indian.
- Oh, I was wild like an Indian.

05:49.660 --> 05:52.020
I rode him all night long.

05:52.190 --> 05:55.320
My hair flying out...

05:55.500 --> 05:58.160
...Shamire snorting, tossing his head.

05:58.730 --> 06:02.930
His hooves were galloping,
thunder in that prairie grass.

06:03.340 --> 06:05.400
You forgot the wolves.

06:05.570 --> 06:09.840
Oh, no. No, no, because the wolves,
they was a-howling.

06:11.610 --> 06:15.450
And the wind, it was a-blowing.

06:15.750 --> 06:18.950
- But you wasn't scared.
- Oh, hell, no. We didn't care.

06:19.120 --> 06:22.020
It was just him and me
in a dead-out run.

06:22.190 --> 06:25.280
Oh, man, my heels were boring
into his belly.

06:25.460 --> 06:29.690
I could feel every breath he took.
God, I could feel his heartbeat.

06:29.900 --> 06:33.360
We were galloping forever,
never wanting to stop.

06:35.270 --> 06:39.170
And we didn't stop until we got
all the way to Montana.

06:39.640 --> 06:41.400
And Grandma Lou had a cow, right?

06:42.110 --> 06:45.910
She had so many cows,
she could have had a cow farm.

06:50.720 --> 06:53.690
Hey, hey.
Mom, we're gonna wake up the manager.

06:54.760 --> 06:56.380
Killjoy.

06:56.730 --> 06:59.460
Hey, Mom, when do we
get to go to Wyoming?

06:59.630 --> 07:01.690
Soon, baby. Soon.

07:01.860 --> 07:05.030
- Is Shamire still there?
- No, silly.

07:05.200 --> 07:07.360
Shamire's dead like your grandpa.

07:07.970 --> 07:11.410
Shamire lives in the barn in Wyoming.

07:11.670 --> 07:13.540
We'd better get everybody to bed.

07:13.710 --> 07:17.040
Okay, okay. One, four, three.

07:17.210 --> 07:19.040
- One.
- I.

07:19.810 --> 07:21.040
- Four.
- Love.

07:21.780 --> 07:24.010
- Three.
- You!

07:49.240 --> 07:50.940
All right, come on. Come on.

07:51.110 --> 07:52.670
Are we blowing the joint?

07:53.280 --> 07:54.910
Kids, towels, towels. Come on.

07:56.380 --> 07:57.440
Got it?

07:58.720 --> 08:00.710
Ready to put it in? Okay, ready?

08:00.890 --> 08:03.880
Count of three. One, two, three.

08:04.060 --> 08:05.290
Go, go, go.

08:11.170 --> 08:14.660
Hey, hey! Hey, you!
Come back. You didn't pay!

08:14.840 --> 08:16.500
Hey!

08:28.450 --> 08:31.680
Grandma Lou! Grandma Lou!

08:31.850 --> 08:35.720
Looks like we've got some
company, unexpected.

08:35.890 --> 08:38.480
- Grandma!
- Oh, my Lord.

08:38.659 --> 08:40.030
Hi, Grandma.

08:40.730 --> 08:42.789
Oh, yeah!

08:42.960 --> 08:46.960
- Guys, these are for Grandma's guests.
- Rowena, I hope you're not staying...

08:47.140 --> 08:50.000
...because I've got my monthly
Bible meeting happening.

08:50.840 --> 08:53.170
- Put that one back.
- Now, don't touch those.

08:53.340 --> 08:55.870
- They're for the Bible ladies.
- Put it back.

08:56.040 --> 08:59.610
Don't put it back. Eat it now
that you've got it. Don't put it back.

08:59.780 --> 09:02.580
Nobody wants to touch food
dirty fingers have touched.

09:02.750 --> 09:06.910
- Oh, there's sandwiches!
- Ladies, this is my family.

09:08.060 --> 09:10.680
Ladies, go right on with your meeting.

09:14.800 --> 09:17.770
When's the last time
these children had something to eat?

09:19.370 --> 09:22.060
These kids have been through hell...

09:22.240 --> 09:27.170
...but I have so learned my lesson.
- Oh, Rowena. Oh, I've heard that before.

09:28.080 --> 09:29.840
- I mean it.
- All right.

09:30.280 --> 09:33.080
All right. I'm gonna do it.
I'm gonna do it.

09:33.250 --> 09:36.810
I'm gonna help you. God help me.

09:37.750 --> 09:40.550
But you can't stay here. No, no.

09:40.720 --> 09:44.350
Yes, I'll help you find a place,
but that's it.

09:47.530 --> 09:48.960
- Hi, Rose.
- Hi, Gracie.

09:49.130 --> 09:50.620
Hi.

09:56.100 --> 09:59.400
This is the last of my dishes.
You have cleaned me out, Rowena.

09:59.570 --> 10:01.840
Of course, you never
take care of anything.

10:02.010 --> 10:03.840
Look what we found by the canal.

10:04.010 --> 10:06.380
Mine is Shadow,
and Rose's is Snowball.

10:06.550 --> 10:09.310
Look at them.
Oh, they're so tiny and cute.

10:09.480 --> 10:12.010
Well, now, that's all you need
is two stray cats.

10:12.190 --> 10:15.020
I mean, how do you know
that they don't have germs?

10:15.190 --> 10:16.710
Can we keep them?

10:16.890 --> 10:19.120
Of course you can keep them.

10:19.290 --> 10:22.130
They look hungry.
Why don't you go get them some milk?

10:23.130 --> 10:25.000
And pick me up some hamburger...

10:25.170 --> 10:29.930
...and a can of tomatoes and some paprika.
Gotta have paprika if you're gonna cook.

10:30.100 --> 10:34.170
- Will you make Rudy's Hungarian goulash?
- I don't know, Rose. You want me to?

10:34.340 --> 10:37.640
- Yes.
- Well, then, hell, yeah. I'm gonna make it.

10:38.610 --> 10:40.580
Who's Rudy?

10:41.980 --> 10:43.810
Mama...

10:45.420 --> 10:48.550
...Rudy was a Hungarian friend of mine.

10:48.720 --> 10:50.320
Only now he's in prison.

10:53.230 --> 10:56.790
Which commandment did he break,
stealing or murder?

11:00.400 --> 11:01.770
What's a commandment?

11:02.340 --> 11:04.430
"What's a commandment?"

11:04.970 --> 11:08.930
- The Ten Commandments...
- That God gave Moses, Rose.

11:09.110 --> 11:10.740
Don't you know anything?

11:10.910 --> 11:15.870
I know you never take the kids to church,
but you should get them back into school.

11:16.050 --> 11:18.420
Tomorrow!

11:19.750 --> 11:22.550
Damn, do I have to write it in blood?
Tomorrow!

11:30.630 --> 11:33.660
Well, don't just stand there gawking.
Go get the milk.

11:33.840 --> 11:36.800
- And the stuff for the goulash?
- Forget the goulash.

11:37.270 --> 11:42.570
Yeah. Your mom's gonna be too busy
cleaning up her dishes.

11:42.740 --> 11:46.480
Would you give them some money
for a frozen pizza?

11:52.790 --> 11:56.280
"Rom... Romeo, Romeo...

11:56.460 --> 12:01.550
...wherefore art thou, Romeo?"

12:01.730 --> 12:04.490
"Wherefore art thou, Romeo?"

12:05.430 --> 12:09.530
She's not asking where he is.
She wants to know why he's called Romeo.

12:09.700 --> 12:15.230
"That which we call a rose
by any other name would smell as sweet."

12:16.340 --> 12:18.070
Go on.

12:19.050 --> 12:21.850
"Deny thy father...

12:22.020 --> 12:25.080
...and refuse thy name...

12:25.250 --> 12:28.850
...or if thy while..."

12:29.020 --> 12:30.250
Wilt!

12:31.660 --> 12:36.150
"Or, if thou wilt not,
be but sworn my love...

12:36.330 --> 12:39.890
...and I'll no longer be a Capulet."

12:42.000 --> 12:43.270
What's your name again?

12:44.640 --> 12:48.130
- Gracie Thompson.
- Okay, Thompson.

12:48.740 --> 12:51.580
You ever heard of Romeo and Juliet?

12:51.950 --> 12:53.500
I know what a Romeo is.

12:55.980 --> 12:58.980
But the story, the play,
Romeo and Juliet...

12:59.150 --> 13:04.220
...Shakespeare, star-crossed lovers,
West Side Story...

13:08.160 --> 13:11.220
They're from two different families
at war with each other.

13:11.400 --> 13:14.230
She's willing to give up everything
for him.

13:14.670 --> 13:18.230
Impetuous, passionate!

13:18.940 --> 13:20.770
Do you kids have any passion?

13:25.010 --> 13:26.880
Thank you, Mr. Bodell.

13:29.250 --> 13:31.550
- Are you okay?
- Today sucked.

13:31.720 --> 13:33.810
So tell me about it.

13:34.890 --> 13:36.950
- Rose.
- Hi, Gracie.

13:37.130 --> 13:38.960
- Hi, Gracie.
- How was your day?

13:39.130 --> 13:41.060
How are you?

13:41.230 --> 13:43.930
- How you doing?
- Oh, hey, girl.

13:44.770 --> 13:46.790
Hey, honey.

13:48.440 --> 13:49.660
What do you think?

13:50.170 --> 13:52.970
I think that's my T-shirt,
and it's too small for you.

13:53.140 --> 13:57.700
- Look at the scale Mom got for us.
- Mama, I know what this is.

13:57.880 --> 13:59.810
The police are gonna be back.

13:59.980 --> 14:03.010
Do you think my boobs
are too small for it?

14:03.180 --> 14:05.550
Oh, come on.
You're not upset, are you?

14:05.720 --> 14:07.590
- I paid for it, didn't I?
- Whatever.

14:07.760 --> 14:09.520
I want you to meet somebody.

14:09.690 --> 14:13.320
Ray, I want you to come out
and meet my little sister, Gracie.

14:13.490 --> 14:15.990
- Mom!
- What? He knows I'm kidding.

14:16.300 --> 14:19.630
Anyway, people do think
we look like sisters, all the time.

14:19.800 --> 14:22.330
- You didn't tell me Gracie was so cute.
- She is.

14:22.500 --> 14:25.960
- How you doing?
- You are so cute.

14:26.140 --> 14:30.980
Gracie. She's always been jealous of me.

14:31.150 --> 14:33.640
- She should be.
- Yeah.

14:46.530 --> 14:48.720
Gracie, you awake?

14:50.300 --> 14:52.290
I am now.

14:52.470 --> 14:53.960
What do you want?

14:54.140 --> 14:57.970
I'm sorry. Can I talk to you outside
for a second?

15:06.680 --> 15:09.550
- What?
- Well, come on.

15:09.720 --> 15:11.050
I'm not gonna bite.

15:12.920 --> 15:14.790
Where's my mom?

15:15.820 --> 15:17.550
She passed out in the bedroom.

15:19.190 --> 15:21.750
Come over here. I just wanna talk.

15:26.570 --> 15:30.330
Kids have had a hard time.
I can see that.

15:31.410 --> 15:35.240
Your mom, she drinks too much.

15:37.040 --> 15:40.100
I just... I just wanna be a friend.

15:41.980 --> 15:44.280
I'm gonna be living here now.

15:44.450 --> 15:46.320
Good luck.

15:49.060 --> 15:51.580
You're a smart girl.
I could tell that right off.

15:51.760 --> 15:53.820
The whole bunch depends on you.

15:54.000 --> 15:56.160
I'm sorry. Did I scare you?

15:58.200 --> 16:00.460
Hey, little girl, I know.

16:00.640 --> 16:03.570
I know how hard it is for you.

16:04.110 --> 16:06.730
There's no one, no one to help you...

16:07.580 --> 16:09.130
...love you...

16:10.880 --> 16:13.610
...there's no one to touch you.

16:13.780 --> 16:15.150
Hey.

16:22.160 --> 16:24.850
Oh, yeah, you are one nice, little...

16:28.100 --> 16:29.460
You bitch.

16:31.800 --> 16:33.820
You like that, huh?

16:36.870 --> 16:38.860
You like it rough.

16:43.340 --> 16:45.640
- What is going on?
- She's coming on to me!

16:45.810 --> 16:49.110
- You liar!
- Stop it. Go to your room.

16:49.280 --> 16:52.480
- Look at my face!
- That's enough of your smart mouth!

16:52.650 --> 16:55.520
- I can't believe you're defending him.
- I am so sorry.

16:55.690 --> 17:00.220
- I am sorry she got out of control.
- He is a complete sleaze.

17:00.390 --> 17:03.520
- He could have broke my jaw, Mom.
- Don't mess this up.

17:05.630 --> 17:07.569
He's the one.

17:08.270 --> 17:09.530
The one what?

17:09.700 --> 17:13.160
Gracie, I'm young. I like him.

17:15.140 --> 17:17.800
I really like this one a lot.

17:19.780 --> 17:21.510
Please.

17:36.700 --> 17:38.630
What happened to you?

17:39.770 --> 17:41.790
Wait a minute.

17:45.640 --> 17:47.300
Who hit you?

17:47.480 --> 17:50.670
- I walked into a door.
- Yeah, right.

17:50.850 --> 17:53.710
Tell me what happened,
or I'll take you to the office.

17:53.880 --> 17:57.080
What difference does it make?
I've been hit since I was born.

17:57.250 --> 17:59.080
- Where do you come from?
- All over.

17:59.250 --> 18:01.920
- Where "all over"?
- All over!

18:02.090 --> 18:05.650
Campgrounds, trailer parks, motels.
We even lived in a car.

18:05.830 --> 18:08.820
I've been to so many schools,
I lost count after 41.

18:11.700 --> 18:15.930
- Did you ever tell anybody about this?
- No.

18:16.570 --> 18:19.370
I'm gonna have to report this.

18:19.910 --> 18:21.500
Why?

18:31.420 --> 18:33.980
Oh, hey. Hi, girls.

18:35.220 --> 18:38.210
Where are the boys?
Look what we got, doughnuts.

18:38.390 --> 18:42.390
- I got doughnuts. Who wants them?
- I do. I'm starving. Can I have two?

18:42.560 --> 18:45.050
Yeah, yeah.

18:45.970 --> 18:48.260
We're gonna get fat.

18:48.440 --> 18:51.770
- Mom, you're way skinny.
- I am? Am I too skinny?

18:51.940 --> 18:53.170
- No.
- Let me see.

18:53.340 --> 18:55.430
Turn around. Oh, that's cute.

18:56.080 --> 18:58.980
- I got jelly for you.
- You've been gone for three days.

18:59.580 --> 19:03.140
We had nothing but cereal.
No money, no milk.

19:03.620 --> 19:07.580
But I don't... I don't deserve a life?
I can't have a little fun?

19:07.760 --> 19:10.190
You kids on my tail all the time.

19:31.850 --> 19:33.640
Thanks.

19:44.290 --> 19:47.320
Shadow, you meanie. You bit my finger.

19:47.500 --> 19:49.730
Do you think mom will let us keep them?

19:49.900 --> 19:52.300
It won't be like Spike, huh?

19:52.730 --> 19:55.860
- Remember that dog that my dad got us?
- Yeah.

19:56.040 --> 19:58.530
Remember how he used to kick it?

20:04.610 --> 20:07.270
Come on. Kids, kids, get up! Get up!

20:07.450 --> 20:10.250
- Come on, cops.
- Mom, what's happening?

20:10.420 --> 20:12.580
Get the kids! The cops are here!

20:12.990 --> 20:15.150
You guys, get your stuff together!

20:15.320 --> 20:17.480
Gracie, come on! Yo, yo, yo.

20:17.660 --> 20:19.750
You gotta help me with these kids, man!

20:19.930 --> 20:23.390
- The hell with the kids. I'm out of here!
- Gracie!

20:30.400 --> 20:32.430
You have the right to remain silent.

20:33.940 --> 20:35.840
- Come on.
- Where are you taking us?

20:36.010 --> 20:38.540
Children can't stay with parents
who have drugs.

20:38.710 --> 20:42.380
Please don't take my kids!
He showed up last night. I don't know him.

20:42.920 --> 20:46.380
I swear to you,
I didn't know he had any drugs!

20:46.550 --> 20:49.050
No! Are they gonna kill Mom?

20:49.220 --> 20:53.630
- No, baby, they're not. She'll be back.
- Gracie, do something!

20:53.790 --> 20:56.590
Please, Gracie!

20:58.200 --> 21:00.960
Okay, boys, Ryan and Jonny
in the first van.

21:01.370 --> 21:03.960
- Wait.
- You and your sister, come with me.

21:04.140 --> 21:06.200
No, no, you can't separate us.

21:06.370 --> 21:09.770
Just for a few days
until this gets straightened out.

21:09.940 --> 21:14.350
- Gracie, do something!
- No, you don't understand. He's fragile.

21:14.520 --> 21:18.580
- Ladies, don't make this worse than it is!
- Gracie, this is all your fault!

21:18.750 --> 21:22.240
- You should have kept your mouth shut!
- Where are you taking him?

21:22.720 --> 21:24.620
- No!
- Let go of him!

21:29.830 --> 21:32.890
He's deathly afraid
of people he doesn't know!

21:33.070 --> 21:37.090
- Please call my grandma!
- Ryan, Ryan, don't get in the van!

21:37.270 --> 21:39.740
Please call my grandmother!

21:39.910 --> 21:43.470
- Don't take him! No, no!
- Please call my grandma!

21:43.640 --> 21:47.480
Let me go! Open the door!
Open the door!

21:48.250 --> 21:49.740
Stop it!

21:49.920 --> 21:52.320
Open the door!

21:58.330 --> 22:00.260
You can't do this!

22:24.120 --> 22:26.480
Get undressed.
Put your bags on the counter.

22:26.650 --> 22:31.250
I put all your stuff in paper bags. You get
everything back when you check out.

22:31.430 --> 22:33.520
This is for your hair. Lice.

22:33.690 --> 22:35.860
- We don't have lice.
- You don't know.

22:36.030 --> 22:38.830
Scrub, or I'm gonna do it for you.
Hit the showers.

22:39.400 --> 22:42.160
Did you see her eyes?
Cat-woman.

22:42.340 --> 22:45.900
At least this smells better
than that stuff Mom used to spray on us.

22:46.070 --> 22:48.230
Yeah, roach spray.

22:48.410 --> 22:51.670
How many kids in this world
get sprayed with roach poison?

22:51.850 --> 22:55.300
It probably got into our genes,
and our kids will be deformed.

22:55.480 --> 22:59.380
Can you believe Mom's in jail?
They're probably spraying her too.

22:59.550 --> 23:03.080
- That'll show her, huh?
- What goes around comes around.

23:03.260 --> 23:07.390
- You could say that again.
- What goes around comes around.

23:07.560 --> 23:12.000
Wake time is 6 a.m. Breakfast is at 7.
General clean up at 8.

23:12.170 --> 23:14.900
You have to be washed,
combed, beds made.

23:15.070 --> 23:19.530
You'll get your assignments for chores:
Kitchen, laundry, restrooms, showers.

23:19.710 --> 23:23.040
- Okay, you're in here. Not you.
- Wait a sec.

23:23.210 --> 23:25.870
- We wanna be together.
- There are no beds together.

23:26.050 --> 23:27.670
We can sleep in the same bed.

23:27.850 --> 23:30.980
- Don't give me a hard time.
- It's not a problem. I wanna...

23:31.150 --> 23:32.410
- No, I wanna...
- Take her.

23:32.590 --> 23:35.210
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

23:35.390 --> 23:37.760
- Let go!
- Gracie! Gracie!

23:37.930 --> 23:40.490
- I just wanna...
- No, Rose!

23:41.560 --> 23:43.890
Don't hurt her!

23:45.730 --> 23:47.430
Move it!

23:47.600 --> 23:50.430
Come on! Come on!

23:50.600 --> 23:54.170
- Are you okay?
- It was freezing in that horrible, little room.

23:54.340 --> 23:57.280
- And they kept the lights on all night.
- Poor baby.

23:57.440 --> 23:59.540
So cold in her little, padded cell.

23:59.710 --> 24:03.170
She's so special, she got
the only single in the hall.

24:03.580 --> 24:06.020
I don't think I can handle this, Gracie.

24:06.190 --> 24:09.520
- She doesn't think she can handle this.
- It's all right, Rose.

24:09.690 --> 24:11.750
- Three. Bigger! Come on, girls.

24:11.930 --> 24:15.220
What about the boys? Do you think
they're going through this?

24:15.400 --> 24:18.960
- Poor little Robbie.
- Poor little Robbie?

24:19.130 --> 24:22.190
- Who's he?
- Another sister, probably.

24:22.370 --> 24:24.340
Better toughen up, little baby.

24:24.510 --> 24:27.300
- Want your diaper changed, stupid?
- I'm not stupid.

24:27.470 --> 24:31.570
- Hey, Rose, don't.
- Hey, Rose, I heard your mother's in jail.

24:31.880 --> 24:34.750
- I heard she's a hooker.
- Oh, well, look who's talking.

24:35.750 --> 24:37.410
Fight!

24:39.120 --> 24:41.050
Don't touch her!

24:41.460 --> 24:43.120
Stop it!

24:43.290 --> 24:45.920
Gracie, get off her!

24:48.360 --> 24:52.230
Where are my brothers?
I have a right to know!

24:53.000 --> 24:56.230
I demand to call my grandmother!

25:00.740 --> 25:02.540
Gram.

25:03.710 --> 25:08.510
- Oh, my little Rose. Grace. Girls.
- Why didn't you come for us?

25:08.680 --> 25:11.240
Well, honey, l...
Nobody told me you were here.

25:11.420 --> 25:12.910
Nobody ever called me.

25:13.090 --> 25:16.320
Every time I called and called,
all I got was recordings.

25:16.490 --> 25:21.020
- Oh, my God. All kinds of recordings.
- What about Robbie and Jonny and Ryan?

25:21.200 --> 25:24.560
All of you are going to stay with me
for a while.

25:24.730 --> 25:26.160
We'll see how it works out.

25:26.330 --> 25:29.330
Let us try it for a while,
and I think that's good.

25:29.500 --> 25:34.070
- Get in the car where it's warm.
- Grandma, you're using a cane.

25:34.240 --> 25:36.680
Grandma Lou, can we please
go get our kittens?

25:37.340 --> 25:39.510
Well, why not?

25:40.280 --> 25:42.110
Shadow?

25:43.350 --> 25:45.510
Here, kitties.

25:45.790 --> 25:47.520
Your mother's still in jail.

25:48.690 --> 25:51.420
So, what happens when she gets out?

25:51.590 --> 25:54.690
She is not allowed to live with you kids.

25:54.860 --> 25:58.130
She can't even see you,
and that's the deal.

25:58.300 --> 26:00.100
Else I don't get to keep you.

26:00.270 --> 26:02.830
I can't get the money to keep you.

26:03.200 --> 26:06.230
Grace, Grandma's got to have some money
to feed you kids.

26:06.410 --> 26:08.700
I got to have the help.

26:10.580 --> 26:13.880
I can't keep cleaning up her messes.

26:14.050 --> 26:16.850
My heart just won't take it.

26:19.350 --> 26:22.910
I hate my mother for doing this.

26:23.390 --> 26:25.860
- No.
- Snowball!

26:26.860 --> 26:29.520
- Shadow?
- Rose.

26:30.530 --> 26:34.060
- They're not here.
- I can't find them.

26:36.900 --> 26:38.370
We'll get new ones.

26:39.140 --> 26:41.630
Gracie!

26:42.140 --> 26:44.800
- Gracie!
- Oh, my God! You've grown!

26:44.980 --> 26:47.210
- I swear you've grown.
- You didn't call us.

26:47.380 --> 26:51.220
- I had no idea where to phone.
- Those mean kids called me a retard. Am I?

26:51.390 --> 26:54.290
- Of course not, Robbie.
- What did you do to your hair?

26:54.450 --> 26:57.510
- Does Grandma have any hair gel?
- Maybe not, but Jell-O.

26:57.690 --> 26:58.750
Come on!

26:58.930 --> 27:00.390
- Hi, Grandma.
- Hi, big boy.

27:00.560 --> 27:04.290
Oh, it's good to see you.
Get in the kitchen.

27:06.470 --> 27:10.730
These kids are driving me nuts. Every time
I turn around, one of them's there.

27:10.900 --> 27:13.900
Yeah, well, Robbie's fine
as long as he can see you.

27:14.070 --> 27:17.600
This morning I went in the bathroom,
and he followed me in there.

27:17.780 --> 27:21.340
We have to keep telling them that we're
at Grandma's and we're safe.

27:21.550 --> 27:23.910
Yeah, which means more commandments.

27:24.080 --> 27:26.710
"Thou shalt go to school."

27:27.120 --> 27:29.420
I hate school.

27:32.960 --> 27:34.290
Gracie.

27:36.900 --> 27:38.690
Okay, okay.

27:41.400 --> 27:44.060
- Don't take all the covers.
- And don't wet the bed.

27:44.240 --> 27:46.100
I won't.

27:46.270 --> 27:47.500
Gracie.

27:48.510 --> 27:51.100
We don't wanna be alone in there.

27:52.550 --> 27:54.810
Just for tonight.

27:54.980 --> 27:56.310
All right. Just be quiet.

28:00.620 --> 28:04.320
- Grandma says we gotta say our prayers.
- Just whisper it.

28:04.490 --> 28:07.150
Now I lay me down to sleep

28:08.060 --> 28:10.930
I pray the Lord my soul to keep

28:11.100 --> 28:12.790
If I should die before...

28:15.140 --> 28:18.500
- You look like a bunch of little animals.
- I won't bite them.

28:18.670 --> 28:21.870
Boys do not sleep with girls!

28:22.040 --> 28:23.840
Is that one of those commandments?

28:24.010 --> 28:26.450
You bet it is.
It's God's commandment.

28:26.610 --> 28:28.670
And you get out of this bed right now.

28:28.850 --> 28:32.620
You go back to your room,
and you stay there. Do you hear me?

29:04.350 --> 29:07.580
- Shouldn't you be in class?
- Lady, I gotta pick my brother up.

29:07.750 --> 29:12.090
My name is not "lady." It's Mrs. Thurston.
I'm a counselor at this school...

29:12.260 --> 29:15.290
...and you will help me
gather up this mess.

29:23.500 --> 29:26.200
- I'm gonna need to talk to your parents.
- Good luck.

29:26.370 --> 29:31.040
- Lf you find my dad, I'd love to meet him.
- Don't give me attitude. I just want answers.

29:31.210 --> 29:33.840
- Now, what about your mother?
- She's in jail.

29:34.010 --> 29:37.510
- Who's the head of the household?
- Supposed to be my grandmother.

29:37.680 --> 29:41.520
- Who buys the food and prepares the meals?
- I do.

29:42.660 --> 29:45.280
You gotta do something
about your schooling.

29:45.460 --> 29:47.890
I don't know how you made it
to the 12th grade.

29:48.060 --> 29:50.190
I don't know what they discuss in class.

29:50.360 --> 29:53.700
Thing is, your IQ tests
say something completely different.

29:54.030 --> 29:57.940
You're just behind, but you
cannot skate through this school...

29:58.110 --> 30:01.070
...like your others.
- Some days I have to leave early.

30:01.240 --> 30:03.370
I don't want to hear
about you ditching.

30:03.540 --> 30:05.940
It's not ditching.
I need a job to make money.

30:06.110 --> 30:10.950
Gracie, making money is not
as important as going to school.

30:11.180 --> 30:15.310
Now, look, I can't help you at home,
but I can make sure you do your best here.

30:16.090 --> 30:18.060
I am doing the best that I can.

30:18.230 --> 30:22.560
And I think you can do a lot better
if you put your mind to it.

30:22.730 --> 30:25.360
Can I be excused?
Or whatever I'm supposed to say.

30:25.530 --> 30:30.830
- I have to pick up my brother.
- Lf you really have to pick him up, go ahead.

30:31.000 --> 30:35.270
But listen, my friend,
you better get your act together.

30:47.190 --> 30:49.450
All right, Wolverines.

30:49.790 --> 30:51.480
She thinks she's so hot.

30:52.130 --> 30:54.620
Ladies, on your marks.

31:00.700 --> 31:01.930
Get set.

31:24.990 --> 31:27.760
So how'd you learn to run so fast?

31:27.930 --> 31:32.060
- Running from truant officers, I guess.
- You should be on the track team.

31:32.230 --> 31:35.570
Yeah, the coach asked me...

31:35.740 --> 31:37.730
...but I don't have time for this.

31:38.310 --> 31:39.930
Yo, Tommy, out here!

31:45.150 --> 31:48.210
- It's only her first week here.
- What are you doing here?

31:48.380 --> 31:50.940
My fault.
I thought she deserved a day off.

31:51.120 --> 31:54.880
She has had plenty of days off
since she met you.

31:55.060 --> 31:56.820
Did you help Grandma with supper?

31:56.990 --> 31:59.480
And the boys?
Did they finish their homework?

31:59.660 --> 32:01.960
Jonny was working
on some stupid model.

32:02.130 --> 32:04.690
He was using toilet-paper rolls
to build columns.

32:04.860 --> 32:08.390
He's making a model of Acropolis.
Maybe you could have helped him.

32:08.840 --> 32:11.700
Miss, could I get a burger
and a chocolate milk shake?

32:11.870 --> 32:13.400
If you can pay for it.

32:13.570 --> 32:17.030
Please. Please, please, Gracie.
He forgot his wallet.

32:17.480 --> 32:19.880
- I forgot my wallet.
- Fine.

32:20.050 --> 32:22.740
I'll pay, but don't come again
without your wallet.

32:22.920 --> 32:28.220
- Please. I gotta be able to depend on you.
- Okay. Thanks, Gracie.

32:37.830 --> 32:39.460
Hey.

32:39.970 --> 32:41.230
You going home?

32:42.600 --> 32:45.260
- Yeah.
- I'll give you a ride.

32:45.970 --> 32:48.740
No. It's not far.

32:48.910 --> 32:50.710
And I take the bus.

33:05.790 --> 33:08.060
My car broke down.

33:08.960 --> 33:12.760
Guess we're going
in the same direction, though.

33:15.340 --> 33:17.830
And don't laugh.
My mom's a psychiatrist.

33:18.000 --> 33:20.440
- Who's laughing?
- Everybody.

33:20.610 --> 33:24.540
She's always asking me crazy stuff.
I don't really wanna tell my mom.

33:25.210 --> 33:28.740
So, what about you?
You haven't said anything about yourself.

33:28.980 --> 33:32.850
- You're not giving me a chance.
- I'm a motor mouth when I'm nervous.

33:33.450 --> 33:36.010
- I make you nervous?
- Hell, yeah.

33:36.190 --> 33:39.850
Okay, it's your turn.
My mouth is sealed.

33:40.890 --> 33:43.020
You asked for it.

33:43.400 --> 33:44.660
This is my house...

33:44.830 --> 33:48.130
...and I live here with my three
half brothers and half sister.

33:48.300 --> 33:50.030
We're all bastards.

33:50.200 --> 33:54.640
We have different last names, different
fathers. I haven't seen mine since I was 2.

33:54.810 --> 33:57.740
Our mother's a drug addict,
and she's in jail right now.

33:57.910 --> 34:00.780
We live with my grandmother
as wards of the court.

34:00.950 --> 34:03.680
All my brothers have ADD.
Jonny has ADHD.

34:03.850 --> 34:06.320
Attention-deficit hyperactive disorder.

34:06.490 --> 34:10.080
Robbie, the youngest, who's a little
slower, has trouble being alone.

34:10.820 --> 34:14.020
- Okay, is that enough?
- No.

34:15.500 --> 34:18.790
- I mean, I'm sorry.
- Don't be.

34:18.969 --> 34:23.030
- I'm not.
- No, I mean, I like you.

34:23.199 --> 34:24.600
I just wanna know you.

34:26.040 --> 34:27.900
- Come here.
- What's the matter?

34:28.070 --> 34:30.409
I don't have time for this.
I run a zoo.

34:30.580 --> 34:32.600
How about I give you a ride tomorrow?

34:32.780 --> 34:35.010
- I told you, I take the bus.
- That's okay.

34:35.179 --> 34:37.949
So tomorrow we'll both take the bus.

34:42.190 --> 34:43.850
What?

34:44.719 --> 34:47.750
You are knocked up,
and I'm the last person that you tell?

34:47.929 --> 34:50.020
- I knew what you'd say.
- This is stupid.

34:50.199 --> 34:52.820
- How are you gonna raise a kid?
- See? I knew it.

34:53.000 --> 34:56.300
You can't quit school. Mom quit,
and look what happened to her.

34:56.469 --> 34:57.700
I hate school.

34:57.870 --> 35:00.430
So you're gonna live with Ricky
and then what?

35:00.610 --> 35:02.770
Clean houses for other people?

35:02.940 --> 35:05.140
Stay here.
We can raise the baby together.

35:05.310 --> 35:07.640
- Oh, Lord.
- Another one won't matter.

35:07.810 --> 35:11.650
- Rose, Ricky said to hurry it up.
- Bye, you guys.

35:12.220 --> 35:15.050
- Rosie, make sure that boy marries you.
- Rose, wait.

35:17.360 --> 35:19.850
We've never been separated.

35:20.030 --> 35:21.290
Hurry it up, babe.

35:21.900 --> 35:25.960
I am saying goodbye to my sister,
Ricky, so just can it.

35:30.240 --> 35:33.760
Look, I know what you're thinking.
That I'm gonna end up like Mom.

35:34.340 --> 35:37.100
But, Gracie, I love him.

35:39.410 --> 35:41.780
I can't do this without you.

35:42.950 --> 35:44.920
It had to happen someday.

35:46.290 --> 35:47.950
I'm not like you.

35:48.120 --> 35:50.180
You can do anything.

35:54.360 --> 35:56.950
Just take care of yourself, huh?

36:04.670 --> 36:06.200
I'll call you.

36:19.790 --> 36:22.380
Excuse me, ma'am.

36:22.560 --> 36:25.850
Could you help me with my computer?
I'm having some problems.

36:26.030 --> 36:27.420
Go away.

36:29.530 --> 36:31.050
So how's it going?

36:31.230 --> 36:32.860
This is right up my alley.

36:33.030 --> 36:37.330
The Black Plague was caused by bacteria
that lived on fleas that lived on rats.

36:37.900 --> 36:41.360
- I know about rats.
- I'm having problems with my computer.

36:41.540 --> 36:44.370
Why don't you come over there
and just, you know...

36:45.350 --> 36:48.310
- lf you don't, then...
- Stop it.

36:49.850 --> 36:53.340
Something's wrong. I don't know...
I don't know what it is.

36:56.490 --> 36:59.150
You have to clear some space.

37:01.730 --> 37:05.060
- Just press "escape."
- What if I don't wanna escape?

37:05.230 --> 37:10.000
- Gracie, that report is due tomorrow.
- I'm almost finished, Mrs. Thurston.

37:10.870 --> 37:12.390
Yes, you are.

37:14.570 --> 37:15.800
Jeez.

37:18.210 --> 37:20.270
She's not that bad.

37:20.450 --> 37:24.380
I mean, she's on my case a lot,
but it's actually kind of nice.

37:24.550 --> 37:27.380
- You know, she cares.
- I care too.

37:27.550 --> 37:31.010
Why don't you invite me to dinner?
Meet Grandma Lou and the kids.

37:31.190 --> 37:32.950
It'd be fun.

37:33.230 --> 37:34.920
I won't bite.

37:35.190 --> 37:37.690
- Okay.
- There it is.

37:37.960 --> 37:40.300
- All right.
- All right.

37:40.970 --> 37:42.430
Robbie...

37:42.600 --> 37:44.590
...we have to bless the food first.

37:45.610 --> 37:47.970
- What do we say?
- A prayer.

37:50.710 --> 37:55.200
Now I lay me down to sleep
I pray the Lord my soul to keep

37:55.380 --> 37:56.910
If I should die before l...

37:57.080 --> 37:59.710
Your grandma means
to have God bless the food.

37:59.890 --> 38:02.080
- Thank you.
- I don't know that one.

38:02.260 --> 38:05.120
Yes, you do. Good food, good meat,
good God, let's eat.

38:09.430 --> 38:11.990
- One, four, three!
- Mom!

38:12.170 --> 38:14.220
- Mom!
- Mom!

38:14.400 --> 38:16.160
Monkeys!

38:16.340 --> 38:18.270
Where you been, Mom?

38:18.440 --> 38:21.930
Oh, oh, hello, my monkeys!

38:22.110 --> 38:24.840
- Did you enjoy your trip?
- Trip?

38:25.010 --> 38:29.070
- Where you went since I've been gone.
- I would hardly call that a trip.

38:29.520 --> 38:30.780
Hi, Mama.

38:32.190 --> 38:35.640
- These kids been good to you?
- Yes, Rowena, they have.

38:35.820 --> 38:39.120
Oh, that's good. That's good.
Everybody, this is Franco.

38:39.290 --> 38:42.350
- Franco, everybody.
- How do you do?

38:42.530 --> 38:44.190
And who is this?

38:44.360 --> 38:47.300
You sure don't look like one of mine.

38:47.470 --> 38:49.300
This is my friend Tommy.

38:49.470 --> 38:53.370
Tommy. Well, I'll be.
It looks like Gracie got lucky, huh?

38:53.540 --> 38:56.670
Mom, would you mind if I talked
to you in the hallway?

38:57.210 --> 38:58.440
Not at all, baby.

38:58.610 --> 39:00.010
What you eating?

39:00.480 --> 39:04.180
Lettuce. Franco, make yourself at home.
I'll be back.

39:05.220 --> 39:07.190
I'll be back.

39:08.350 --> 39:09.950
Would you care to join us?

39:10.920 --> 39:13.980
- I didn't know you had a boyfriend.
- He's not my boyfriend.

39:15.330 --> 39:17.390
Whatever he is...

39:17.560 --> 39:19.860
...he sure is hot.

39:20.030 --> 39:21.330
You can't stay here.

39:22.900 --> 39:25.340
What gives you the right
to tell me what to do?

39:25.510 --> 39:28.440
Because I don't want another trip
to a youth facility.

39:28.610 --> 39:30.840
And that's exactly what's gonna happen...

39:31.010 --> 39:33.540
...if you and your friend
don't get out of here.

39:37.350 --> 39:40.440
I just got out of jail, Gracie.

39:42.820 --> 39:45.990
You don't wanna give me
a "welcome home"?

39:48.360 --> 39:51.630
You don't wanna give
your mama a hug?

40:01.640 --> 40:03.170
Thank you.

40:04.440 --> 40:06.280
I missed you.

40:07.750 --> 40:12.410
Look, we're doing really good right now.
Please don't mess this up.

40:17.220 --> 40:20.320
I am not gonna mess this up.

40:24.930 --> 40:27.900
I am not gonna mess this up.

40:48.190 --> 40:51.710
- He's got the big rig there.
Vanderpool with the turnaround...

40:53.860 --> 40:55.920
- Well, hey there, Tommy.
- How you doing?

40:56.100 --> 40:59.590
- Where are you two off to?
- I'm taking Gracie to meet my folks.

40:59.770 --> 41:02.790
Oh, yeah, and we weren't invited?

41:03.340 --> 41:05.460
Hi. I'm as ready as I'll ever be.

41:05.640 --> 41:08.110
You could use a little makeup
if you ask me.

41:08.270 --> 41:09.830
- You look great.
- Thanks.

41:10.010 --> 41:12.240
- Okay, well, good night.
- Oh, hey, hey!

41:14.380 --> 41:16.810
Try doing something I might do.

41:18.380 --> 41:20.480
Bye, Mrs. Larson.

41:29.900 --> 41:32.590
- How many people live here?
- It's not that big.

41:32.770 --> 41:34.320
Yes, it is.

41:34.500 --> 41:38.630
Tommy, oh, my God, my entire house
could fit in your garage.

41:38.810 --> 41:41.500
- Do you think I need makeup?
- Will you knock it off?

41:41.670 --> 41:44.110
Tommy, they are not gonna like me.

41:44.280 --> 41:47.140
Listen, I like you.

41:52.590 --> 41:55.780
They're gonna love you. Come on.

41:56.160 --> 41:58.090
Mom, Dad!

42:00.090 --> 42:02.250
So Tommy tells me
you have three brothers.

42:02.430 --> 42:04.420
- And a sister.
- Older, younger?

42:04.600 --> 42:06.620
- Younger.
- How much younger?

42:06.800 --> 42:09.360
- She was a sophomore.
- Is this the Inquisition?

42:09.540 --> 42:13.060
I'm just interested, Stan,
so just leave us alone.

42:15.740 --> 42:19.540
Her name is Rose, and she's getting married
and expecting a baby.

42:19.710 --> 42:21.770
Oh, goodness.

42:22.350 --> 42:25.180
I hope that's not giving
you two any ideas.

42:25.350 --> 42:29.480
- Well, I thought you wanted a grandbaby.
- I do, but not yet.

42:31.090 --> 42:32.990
Where's the powder room?

42:33.160 --> 42:35.920
The bathroom.
It's through the door and to the left.

42:36.100 --> 42:38.260
- Tommy, show Gracie.
- It's okay. I got it.

42:38.430 --> 42:43.300
- Gracie, how do you like your burgers?
- Cooked.

43:14.930 --> 43:16.930
Powder room?

43:40.230 --> 43:43.460
I keep telling your son
he has to visit some colleges...

43:43.630 --> 43:45.430
...and make some decisions.

43:45.600 --> 43:50.430
- What colleges are you looking into?
- I hadn't really thought about it.

43:50.600 --> 43:53.730
Well, you'd better.
There's lots of competition.

43:57.240 --> 43:59.140
Oh, are you still hungry?

43:59.310 --> 44:02.440
If no one's gonna eat them,
may I take them to my brothers?

44:02.620 --> 44:05.710
- My grandma has a microwave...
- Of course not.

44:05.890 --> 44:09.450
- We have some buns. We got some cookies.
- Get some containers.

44:11.890 --> 44:14.860
- They're just little children.
- What am I supposed to do?

44:15.030 --> 44:20.900
Rowena, I have asked you
not to smoke in my house.

44:23.770 --> 44:26.430
Oh, okay.

44:26.610 --> 44:31.170
That Franco fellow is upstairs
asleep on my bed...

44:31.880 --> 44:36.710
...and little Robbie told me
that he saw you in there with him...

44:36.880 --> 44:38.610
...doing exercises with him...

44:38.780 --> 44:42.120
...and I know them exercises.
In front of your own children!

44:42.290 --> 44:45.660
What am I supposed to do?
There was no lock on the door.

44:46.290 --> 44:49.560
Well, I'm sorry, though.
I mean, that... Oh, God.

44:49.730 --> 44:52.430
I don't want the kids to see me
like that, either.

44:52.600 --> 44:57.000
I mean, what am I supposed to do?
I don't have much. He's all I've got.

44:57.170 --> 44:59.160
Rowena, the children are so upset.

44:59.340 --> 45:03.800
They've promised not to tell anybody that
you're here, but they're little children...

45:03.980 --> 45:06.270
...and Robbie, he doesn't understand.

45:06.450 --> 45:10.010
Oh, God. Your daddy,
this would just about kill him.

45:11.480 --> 45:14.610
Listen, Rowena, that check
is gonna come tomorrow...

45:14.790 --> 45:19.050
...and why don't you and your man
take the check.

45:19.230 --> 45:22.250
Why don't y'all just leave,
because you know what?

45:22.430 --> 45:25.920
It would really be best for everybody.

45:26.100 --> 45:29.000
- I bring nothing but misery.
- I didn't say that.

45:29.170 --> 45:30.970
No, you did. You might as well.

45:31.140 --> 45:33.470
Let me get Franco.
I'll get out of your hair.

45:33.640 --> 45:36.230
Please come to Mama.
Listen to me, honey.

45:37.010 --> 45:39.980
If you just get back into the church...

45:40.510 --> 45:42.240
Mom.

45:43.650 --> 45:46.240
Why don't you admit
I should have never been born.

45:46.420 --> 45:49.050
Oh, God. Don't say that, Rowena.

45:49.220 --> 45:50.880
You're my baby.

45:51.320 --> 45:55.990
Oh, God. I will not turn you out.

45:56.160 --> 45:59.330
My sweet baby. My little baby.

46:00.000 --> 46:04.440
Oh, my God. I love you so much.

46:06.410 --> 46:09.140
I love you too, Mama.

46:09.910 --> 46:11.340
Oh, my baby.

46:14.880 --> 46:17.010
God, I love you.

46:17.680 --> 46:19.950
We know your mother's
at your grandmother's.

46:20.120 --> 46:22.140
I just have to ask you one question.

46:22.320 --> 46:26.690
Are there any relatives
that would take you and your siblings?

46:27.360 --> 46:29.850
Not that I know of.

46:30.500 --> 46:32.230
We'll have to find foster homes.

46:32.400 --> 46:35.060
You're not separating us.
We've been through that.

46:35.230 --> 46:38.330
- It's not juvenile hall.
- They take the kids for the money.

46:38.500 --> 46:40.470
I'm not stupid.

46:40.640 --> 46:44.300
- Look, I'll get my mother out of the house.
- It won't work.

46:44.480 --> 46:46.310
Your grandma will take her back.

46:46.480 --> 46:49.280
- She says she won't, but she does.
- I'll take them.

46:49.450 --> 46:54.250
I'll take them. I'll get an apartment away
from Grandma, and I'll save up my money.

46:54.420 --> 46:57.620
- That money is for junior college.
- I can always make more.

46:57.790 --> 46:59.420
Gracie, you're 17 years old.

46:59.590 --> 47:03.860
You have to be a legal adult to be a foster
parent. You'd have to be emancipated.

47:04.030 --> 47:05.260
I can do that?

47:06.530 --> 47:08.190
Yeah.

47:08.370 --> 47:10.700
Even then,
a judge would have to go for it.

47:10.870 --> 47:14.770
- That's too much on your shoulders.
- It has always been on my shoulders.

47:14.940 --> 47:17.770
Look, this is a solution.

47:17.940 --> 47:19.430
You can't separate us.

47:22.620 --> 47:24.640
I'll be their mother.

47:26.950 --> 47:28.750
You...

47:28.920 --> 47:31.520
...are not their mother!

47:33.090 --> 47:38.090
- Is this so you can get the caregiver money?
- You are doing this to get the money.

47:38.260 --> 47:41.790
This is all a setup! She gets the money,
and she gives it to you.

47:41.970 --> 47:44.700
Only because it belongs to me,
you bitch!

47:44.870 --> 47:47.000
No, don't curse your daughter like that!

47:47.170 --> 47:48.830
You shut up!

47:51.680 --> 47:54.340
- You are not taking my kids!
- Your kids?

47:54.950 --> 47:57.640
Just admit that you had us
for the welfare money.

47:57.820 --> 48:01.950
Too bad you had so many miscarriages
because there would have been more!

48:03.290 --> 48:07.060
- You go to hell!
- I was born in hell!

48:11.000 --> 48:16.660
They are never going to give them to you.

48:17.140 --> 48:19.230
Not to you.

48:20.870 --> 48:22.240
Just leave...

48:24.980 --> 48:26.670
...before I call the cops.

48:51.840 --> 48:57.100
Oh, my little baby grandchild.
I love you.

49:04.780 --> 49:06.410
Oh, God.

49:16.160 --> 49:19.430
- We can run away.
- We don't have any wheels.

49:19.600 --> 49:22.470
We could take a bus, get jobs
and find a place to live.

49:22.640 --> 49:25.760
- Wyoming.
- We can't run away, guys.

49:25.940 --> 49:29.240
That's how Mom deals with her problems,
by skipping town.

49:29.410 --> 49:31.210
We have to ask the court.

49:31.380 --> 49:34.970
You take care of us,
so why do we have to ask the court?

49:35.150 --> 49:37.480
Judges are smart
and listen to both sides...

49:37.650 --> 49:40.550
...and they figure out
what's best for us, right?

49:40.720 --> 49:43.450
We already know what's best for us.

49:45.090 --> 49:47.220
Why don't I read you guys a story.

49:47.790 --> 49:50.130
We've read Bambi about 100 times.

49:50.300 --> 49:53.960
Don't knock it.
It's the only book we've got.

50:15.450 --> 50:17.890
I don't think you know
what you're doing.

50:18.060 --> 50:21.930
- You understand they must stay in school?
- Yes, sir.

50:22.090 --> 50:24.720
You're employed part-time.
You have a work permit?

50:24.900 --> 50:28.230
- Yes, sir. Through the school.
- This has been a very trying day.

50:28.400 --> 50:31.730
I've had half a dozen children
who had to be placed.

50:32.940 --> 50:36.740
Well, your school records have
certainly improved. Mrs. Thurston?

50:36.910 --> 50:37.930
Yes, Your Honor?

50:38.110 --> 50:41.440
You're a counselor at Gracie's school.
What's your assessment?

50:41.610 --> 50:47.550
Gracie is doing extremely well, and I'm
also encouraging her to apply for college.

50:47.720 --> 50:49.880
All of the children are making an effort.

50:50.520 --> 50:54.720
Ryan and Robbie are in special day classes,
and Jonny's pulling in A's.

50:54.890 --> 50:57.160
What happens to them
when Gracie's at work?

50:57.330 --> 51:00.200
My grandmother can come
to my apartment after school...

51:00.370 --> 51:02.460
...or there's foster-family daycare.

51:02.630 --> 51:05.600
I know it's not perfect,
but it's very important to me...

51:05.770 --> 51:08.140
...and to my brothers
that we stay together.

51:11.280 --> 51:15.540
Where is the mother, Rowena Larson?

51:15.710 --> 51:18.910
I talked to her yesterday.
She said she would be here.

51:20.350 --> 51:22.750
Well, how did these children
get here today?

51:22.920 --> 51:25.910
- Easy. We took the bus.
- You don't have a car?

51:26.090 --> 51:28.150
We're getting one.

51:30.830 --> 51:34.420
Look, I don't understand this money
problem with your grandmother.

51:34.600 --> 51:38.060
She's getting $520 a month
for each child.

51:38.240 --> 51:41.900
The thing is, Your Honor, my grandmother
gives the money to my mother.

51:42.070 --> 51:43.560
We don't ever see it.

51:43.740 --> 51:47.970
Gracie buys us our shoes and stuff, sir.
I mean, Your Honor.

51:48.150 --> 51:51.170
The money would have to go
directly to you.

51:51.350 --> 51:53.380
That's gonna make Grandma really mad.

51:53.550 --> 51:55.990
Because my mother
will raise hell about it.

51:56.990 --> 51:59.580
- I mean, heck.
- You don't have to worry about her.

51:59.760 --> 52:02.890
Just worry about these kids.
You got a checking account?

52:03.060 --> 52:05.220
- I can get one.
- What about an apartment?

52:05.400 --> 52:07.370
I found one. It has to be approved.

52:07.530 --> 52:10.530
How will you handle it?
You got telephone, electricity.

52:10.700 --> 52:13.300
These children gotta have
their own bed, dresser.

52:13.470 --> 52:16.130
- Yes, I have the list.
- This is ridiculous.

52:16.310 --> 52:19.800
- I'll give you a week to get it all in order.
- I can do it, judge.

52:19.980 --> 52:23.970
Well, if you can do all that, maybe
we should give you a job around here.

52:24.380 --> 52:27.280
Okay.

52:27.450 --> 52:31.390
This is just temporary,
but we're gonna give it a three-month trial.

52:31.560 --> 52:35.720
But I'm gonna be watching you. I want
reports from the doctor, the dentist...

52:35.890 --> 52:38.590
...and copies of report cards.

52:38.960 --> 52:44.300
This is highly unusual, but I'm giving you
a chance to keep your family together.

52:44.470 --> 52:46.560
I hope it doesn't come back
to haunt me.

52:46.740 --> 52:49.640
- Thank you, Judge Donner. Thank you.
- Next case.

53:04.160 --> 53:06.890
Tough neighborhood. I don't know.

53:07.060 --> 53:12.050
It's better than most places we've lived,
and we can stay in the same schools.

53:13.130 --> 53:14.760
Well...

53:15.770 --> 53:18.200
...you're gonna have to clean it up.

53:19.040 --> 53:23.300
I have plenty of experience
scrubbing out bathtubs and cupboards.

53:23.740 --> 53:26.300
Well, put some pictures up.

53:26.480 --> 53:29.850
Family stuff. Make it cozy and warm.

53:30.020 --> 53:33.380
- I'll be back in a week.
- Does that mean you approve it?

53:35.020 --> 53:36.250
Done.

53:38.760 --> 53:42.560
- You did this without telling me?
- I was afraid you'd think I was nuts.

53:42.730 --> 53:44.530
No, my parents think you're nuts.

53:44.700 --> 53:47.320
I, on the other hand,
think you're incredible.

53:47.500 --> 53:51.160
I didn't have a choice.
Before I know it, I'm picking out beds.

53:51.340 --> 53:54.900
- What do you think of this one?
- It's way too soft. You know what?

53:55.070 --> 53:57.600
We got a twin bed in the garage.

53:58.380 --> 54:00.740
Okay, how much money you got?

54:00.910 --> 54:03.970
I've saved a few thousand,
and with the foster-care money...

54:04.150 --> 54:07.020
Wait a minute. You've been saving
your money in a sock?

54:07.190 --> 54:09.280
Yeah, underneath the mattress.

54:09.450 --> 54:13.360
Why didn't you just put it in the bank,
you know? Earn some interest.

54:14.630 --> 54:15.620
What's that?

54:15.790 --> 54:19.390
The bank pays you a percentage
for the use of your money.

54:19.900 --> 54:21.990
Free money?

54:22.470 --> 54:27.430
That is a great, great idea.

54:47.160 --> 54:51.120
- This thing's awesome!
- Go, Gracie, go! Go, Gracie, go!

54:54.900 --> 54:56.490
Grandma...

54:57.800 --> 55:01.260
...could you cut this for me
right there on that line?

55:02.510 --> 55:05.870
Left, left, left, right, left.

55:06.040 --> 55:11.350
- Up the stairs.
- Left, left, left, right, left.

55:28.600 --> 55:33.090
We found a kitten!
Can we keep him, please?

55:33.270 --> 55:36.900
Yes, we can. You all are gonna
be taking care of him, okay?

55:37.080 --> 55:38.910
What do we call him?

55:39.080 --> 55:41.880
- Lobo.
- That's a good name.

56:06.200 --> 56:08.470
Okay, thank you, Jonny.
That's good enough.

56:08.640 --> 56:11.670
What did I tell you?
We do not jump on the furniture.

56:11.840 --> 56:15.510
Put it in the corner. Thank Mrs. Turner
when we give it back to her.

56:15.680 --> 56:19.780
We don't have any pictures,
so what pictures do we put in the frames?

56:21.190 --> 56:22.880
Keep the ones that are in there.

56:23.060 --> 56:26.460
Isn't Mr. Bessey supposed to be here?
I'm late for my open house.

56:26.630 --> 56:29.790
- Don't worry. He will be here.
- Now can we go out and play?

56:29.960 --> 56:32.690
No, I don't want you guys
getting all dirty again.

56:32.860 --> 56:35.890
Mr. Bessey is never late,
so something must have come up.

56:36.070 --> 56:39.630
Okay, that's him. Okay, come on.
Come on, come on, come on.

56:41.470 --> 56:43.740
Okay, everybody ready? Clean hands?

56:44.440 --> 56:46.000
Elbows?

56:46.180 --> 56:47.810
- Okay, good.
- This is such bull!

56:47.980 --> 56:51.710
- We're gonna miss the whole thing.
- Calm down, Ryan.

56:53.390 --> 56:56.320
Hello. I'm Sandy Jacobs.
I'm your social worker.

56:56.490 --> 56:59.920
Hi. You know what?
There might be a mistake.

57:00.090 --> 57:03.060
Bob Bessey, Mr. Bessey,
he's actually our social worker.

57:03.230 --> 57:06.130
Your file's on my desk now.
That's the way it works.

57:06.300 --> 57:07.770
Okay.

57:08.830 --> 57:10.390
You're late.

57:10.570 --> 57:12.200
- Sorry. Traffic.
- Yeah, right.

57:12.370 --> 57:14.270
We have a phone.
You could've called.

57:14.440 --> 57:17.810
They're upset because they had
an open house at school tonight.

57:17.980 --> 57:19.880
Yeah, it started an hour ago.

57:21.250 --> 57:25.410
Yes, well, this takes precedence
over an open house at school.

57:29.190 --> 57:31.450
It's very homey.

57:31.620 --> 57:34.720
- You have gas, electricity?
- Look at our kitten, Lobo.

57:34.890 --> 57:37.450
It means "wolf" because he bites.

57:39.160 --> 57:41.360
- We got our teeth cleaned.
- Me too.

57:41.530 --> 57:45.440
Yes, I have the reports.
Who are these people?

57:46.300 --> 57:48.830
Aunt Beth Ann and Uncle Mike.

57:49.610 --> 57:52.840
- And where do they live?
- Portland.

57:53.010 --> 57:54.740
They do?

57:58.980 --> 58:03.580
Okay, I noticed in the report that
your Grandma Lou checks here regularly.

58:03.760 --> 58:07.780
- We have a stable support line.
- Very stable.

58:08.230 --> 58:12.130
And I noticed that Brian
has communication problems.

58:12.300 --> 58:14.160
Do you mean Ryan?

58:14.330 --> 58:16.700
Oh, yes, Ryan. Sorry.

58:16.870 --> 58:19.030
So many families. So many children.

58:19.200 --> 58:22.570
I don't wanna upset him.
I would rather discuss this in private.

58:23.180 --> 58:25.610
I think you should consider
counseling for him.

58:27.650 --> 58:30.950
That... That's a great idea. I will do that.

58:31.120 --> 58:34.110
Okay, well, I have to make my report
to the judge.

58:34.820 --> 58:37.450
All in all, I would say, "Good job."

58:37.790 --> 58:40.620
I'm gonna grant you
a three-month extension.

58:41.760 --> 58:43.660
Good work, boys.

58:50.670 --> 58:54.370
Grace, I have got to hand it to you.

58:54.540 --> 58:57.740
You have a lot of patience.

58:58.040 --> 59:02.070
And you're a better mother
than I ever was.

59:02.250 --> 59:05.480
Grandma, we never could have
done all this without you.

59:06.590 --> 59:08.490
Who drank all the milk?

59:08.650 --> 59:12.610
If you drink all the milk, we don't have
anything left for the week.

59:13.190 --> 59:15.250
Why couldn't we get cereal?

59:15.430 --> 59:18.790
Because it's too expensive.
Ryan will eat the whole box.

59:18.960 --> 59:21.300
It's got too much sugar.
You're hyper enough.

59:21.470 --> 59:25.060
- Gracie, who are those guys?
- Mind your own business. Get in the car.

59:30.980 --> 59:32.600
Down, Robbie! Get down!

59:34.210 --> 59:36.840
Gracie! Gracie!

59:37.720 --> 59:38.980
Stay down, Robbie!

59:41.390 --> 59:43.220
It's okay.

59:44.560 --> 59:46.220
It's okay.

59:49.960 --> 59:52.690
You can't give us any description
of the shooters?

59:52.860 --> 59:55.800
You didn't notice the make,
the color of either vehicle?

59:55.970 --> 59:58.940
I was covering up my brother.
That's all I thought about.

59:59.100 --> 01:00:01.500
- Where exactly were you?
- Where were you?

01:00:01.670 --> 01:00:04.270
Don't talk to my sister like that.
She pays taxes!

01:00:04.440 --> 01:00:07.470
- Show some respect.
- You were caught in a crossfire.

01:00:07.650 --> 01:00:11.640
They shot our car! Through the door,
the rear-view mirror, the windshield!

01:00:11.820 --> 01:00:15.450
- They blew a tire off! My sister came home...
- Ryan, get a grip!

01:00:18.090 --> 01:00:20.790
Go upstairs. I'll be up in a minute.

01:00:22.590 --> 01:00:24.530
Now!

01:00:26.360 --> 01:00:28.700
Excuse my brother.
He thinks he's my husband.

01:00:28.870 --> 01:00:31.730
This is all so terrible.
You could have been killed.

01:00:31.900 --> 01:00:33.840
Grandma!

01:00:34.470 --> 01:00:37.700
Robbie, honey, go upstairs
and get ready for bed. Take Lobo.

01:00:37.880 --> 01:00:40.110
Jonny will read one of the stories
we bought.

01:00:40.280 --> 01:00:42.370
Good night, Mr. Policeman.

01:00:42.550 --> 01:00:44.880
- You are not helping this.
- I know.

01:00:45.050 --> 01:00:47.920
I shouldn't have said that,
but I couldn't help myself.

01:00:48.090 --> 01:00:51.020
- I know, Grandma.
- These things were always happening...

01:00:51.190 --> 01:00:54.560
...to your mom.
- Gracie! I came as soon as I could.

01:00:54.730 --> 01:00:56.490
You okay?

01:00:58.400 --> 01:01:00.460
- What's wrong?
- I think I'm gonna puke.

01:01:06.540 --> 01:01:08.770
Okay, you guys say your prayers?

01:01:08.940 --> 01:01:11.530
All right. Good night.
Don't let the bedbugs bite.

01:01:11.710 --> 01:01:14.510
- Good night.
- Good night, Tommy.

01:01:19.450 --> 01:01:20.440
Hey.

01:01:21.450 --> 01:01:22.510
Hi.

01:01:23.490 --> 01:01:26.480
I can't believe you threw up
on that cop.

01:01:26.990 --> 01:01:29.860
Yeah, it was a real projectile too.

01:01:30.360 --> 01:01:34.200
It was a freak accident.
It could have happened to anybody.

01:01:34.970 --> 01:01:40.130
It just brings up so much old stuff,
you know, with my mommy.

01:01:42.770 --> 01:01:44.740
It's like nothing has changed.

01:01:45.010 --> 01:01:47.710
You're not in that life anymore.

01:01:49.380 --> 01:01:52.320
- It's time we made plans.
- Plans?

01:01:52.480 --> 01:01:55.390
Tommy, I can't even plan
on lunch next week.

01:01:55.550 --> 01:01:57.820
I'm going to court
every time I turn around.

01:01:57.990 --> 01:02:00.550
I'm going from social worker
to social worker.

01:02:00.730 --> 01:02:03.490
I have to do the laundry
and the groceries by myself.

01:02:03.660 --> 01:02:06.430
- I put shoes on their feet.
- They're getting older.

01:02:06.600 --> 01:02:09.120
Your grandmother can take over soon.

01:02:10.900 --> 01:02:15.700
- You're not hearing me.
- I'm hearing you, baby. Yes, I am.

01:02:16.110 --> 01:02:18.470
Next year, we're gonna get
our own place.

01:02:18.640 --> 01:02:20.870
I'm gonna go to Braxton.
You'll go with me.

01:02:21.050 --> 01:02:24.880
- Tommy, I can't afford college.
- On a scholarship.

01:02:25.050 --> 01:02:29.040
Gracie, you're getting A's and B's.

01:02:30.320 --> 01:02:32.450
Baby, I love you.

01:02:33.530 --> 01:02:37.190
We're gonna get through this together.

01:02:38.430 --> 01:02:40.630
Think about you for a change.

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:45.470
Forget about it.

01:02:47.440 --> 01:02:49.100
Think about it.

01:02:53.610 --> 01:02:55.880
Right now I'm thinking
about something else.

01:03:08.460 --> 01:03:12.060
- So, what do you think now?
- It's very ivory-tower.

01:03:12.230 --> 01:03:14.700
- You like?
- I like. For you.

01:03:14.870 --> 01:03:17.530
What makes you think
they'll give me a scholarship?

01:03:17.700 --> 01:03:20.430
- This. I went on the Internet.
- By yourself?

01:03:20.610 --> 01:03:24.410
Oh, very funny. Look,
foster-family scholarship application.

01:03:24.580 --> 01:03:27.700
- All you have to do is apply. It's a lock.
- Yeah, right.

01:03:27.880 --> 01:03:30.680
- Do you know what a college degree means?
- More money?

01:03:30.850 --> 01:03:32.370
No, more us.

01:03:32.550 --> 01:03:35.450
You know, have our own kids,
start a family.

01:03:35.750 --> 01:03:37.720
Instant family, just add Tommy.

01:03:38.520 --> 01:03:40.220
You want?

01:03:43.360 --> 01:03:46.090
Yes. Tommy, I want very much.

01:03:46.660 --> 01:03:48.430
Good.

01:03:51.900 --> 01:03:54.200
I've never once seen you take a break.

01:03:54.370 --> 01:03:57.500
I'm applying for a scholarship,
so wish me luck.

01:03:57.680 --> 01:04:01.040
College? I thought you were saving
for a wedding dress.

01:04:01.210 --> 01:04:05.310
That'll come later.
And I'm renting a wedding dress.

01:04:05.480 --> 01:04:08.710
I'm not gonna buy anything
that I'm only gonna wear once.

01:04:09.690 --> 01:04:11.150
Hello?

01:04:11.320 --> 01:04:13.550
Gracie, it's for you.

01:04:24.440 --> 01:04:26.130
Grandma.

01:04:26.300 --> 01:04:28.970
Hi. I'm here.

01:04:29.140 --> 01:04:30.870
It's gonna be okay.

01:04:31.040 --> 01:04:32.770
Rowena?

01:04:32.940 --> 01:04:35.610
No, no, Grandma. It's Gracie.

01:04:35.780 --> 01:04:39.510
You're running around
without your shoes...

01:04:39.680 --> 01:04:42.210
...like when you ride your horse.

01:04:42.390 --> 01:04:46.650
- I told you a million times.
- No, Grandma. It's Gracie.

01:04:46.820 --> 01:04:49.290
I've got my shoes on.

01:04:49.530 --> 01:04:52.190
I knew you'd come, Rowena...

01:04:52.360 --> 01:04:55.730
...because you know
how much I love you.

01:04:55.900 --> 01:04:57.770
You know I spoiled you.

01:04:57.940 --> 01:05:01.430
I spoiled you when you were a little girl,
but I was too strict...

01:05:01.610 --> 01:05:04.670
...in all the wrong ways.

01:05:06.510 --> 01:05:09.910
Parents aren't always so smart.

01:05:10.480 --> 01:05:14.650
But I promise,
I'm gonna make it up to you.

01:05:14.820 --> 01:05:20.350
Oh, forgive me, Rowena, please.

01:05:20.530 --> 01:05:22.550
You forgive your mama?

01:05:23.030 --> 01:05:27.730
Yeah. Yeah, I forgive you.

01:05:30.540 --> 01:05:33.200
Just rest now, okay?

01:05:34.010 --> 01:05:36.630
Just rest because I need you.

01:05:37.610 --> 01:05:39.940
We all need you.

01:05:41.780 --> 01:05:43.800
Just rest.

01:05:45.550 --> 01:05:48.420
Lord, when we hear the words
of your commandments...

01:05:48.590 --> 01:05:50.920
...that you giveth and you taketh away...

01:05:51.090 --> 01:05:55.620
...so often we look only at the part
that's half empty, the taketh away.

01:05:55.790 --> 01:06:00.130
Yet, even as we are filled with sadness
for the loss of our beloved Louella...

01:06:00.300 --> 01:06:03.320
...we are also here to celebrate
what she gave us.

01:06:03.500 --> 01:06:08.440
Louella Larson, proud mother to a fine
and wonderful daughter, Rowena...

01:06:08.610 --> 01:06:12.370
...loving grandmother...
- Isn't Mom supposed to be here?

01:06:12.540 --> 01:06:14.980
She told Rose she was coming.

01:06:15.150 --> 01:06:19.640
- Just plain Lou, although
Lou was anything but plain.

01:06:20.320 --> 01:06:22.340
We ask you, dear Lord, to take her.

01:06:24.520 --> 01:06:28.190
I'm starving. All I want
is chocolate all the time.

01:06:30.800 --> 01:06:32.590
Kids!

01:06:32.760 --> 01:06:34.860
Boys!

01:06:38.870 --> 01:06:41.500
Oh, my God. You guys.

01:06:41.670 --> 01:06:44.010
We couldn't find the church.

01:06:46.040 --> 01:06:50.540
Tommy, you're still around, dude.
That's rocking.

01:06:51.780 --> 01:06:54.950
Well, look at you.
My girls, my little girls.

01:06:55.120 --> 01:06:57.450
My baby girls.

01:06:57.620 --> 01:06:59.350
Hi, Mom.

01:07:03.900 --> 01:07:05.950
Get out!

01:07:07.270 --> 01:07:09.790
Oh, my golly.

01:07:10.170 --> 01:07:14.430
Can you believe it?
I'm gonna be a grandma.

01:07:18.510 --> 01:07:20.410
Poor Grandma Lou, huh?

01:07:26.080 --> 01:07:29.140
You guys, listen. I want you
to know something, okay?

01:07:29.990 --> 01:07:31.580
If you want anything...

01:07:32.390 --> 01:07:36.420
...of your grandma's, a little trinket
or keepsake, you let me know.

01:07:36.590 --> 01:07:40.430
She didn't have much. She only had
$ 7000, which she gave me, of course...

01:07:40.600 --> 01:07:45.230
...you know, and the house and furniture.
Listen, where are my boys?

01:07:48.370 --> 01:07:50.270
They're outside.

01:07:55.210 --> 01:07:59.210
- Come on, come on.
- Hey, boys, guess who's home.

01:08:03.550 --> 01:08:06.580
Well, what's up?
Come on, Jonny, Robbie.

01:08:06.760 --> 01:08:10.960
- Well, come on! Yeah, Robbie!
- Mama!

01:08:11.430 --> 01:08:13.590
Hi, baby.

01:08:14.400 --> 01:08:16.300
How's my boy? Come on.

01:08:17.370 --> 01:08:21.529
- Jonny, let's go, man. Come on.
- Oh, Mom.

01:08:21.710 --> 01:08:23.609
Ryan?

01:08:23.779 --> 01:08:24.760
Ryan?

01:08:25.310 --> 01:08:27.069
Come on, man.

01:08:28.380 --> 01:08:31.470
That's the way I like to see it.

01:08:33.319 --> 01:08:36.380
Do you think she's gonna try
and take the boys?

01:08:38.319 --> 01:08:39.910
Who knows what she's gonna do?

01:08:40.760 --> 01:08:42.920
I got her.

01:08:43.229 --> 01:08:44.790
Come on.

01:09:39.819 --> 01:09:44.050
Gracie, that guy over there,
he wants to talk to you.

01:09:47.430 --> 01:09:48.859
Okay.

01:09:49.029 --> 01:09:51.649
Will you cover for me? Thanks.

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:57.300
What can I do for you?

01:09:57.470 --> 01:10:01.000
What you can do is get your ass
over here and give me a hug.

01:10:01.170 --> 01:10:03.000
Who are you?

01:10:03.470 --> 01:10:05.600
Gracie, I'm your daddy.

01:10:07.110 --> 01:10:09.550
What's the matter?
You don't believe me?

01:10:10.050 --> 01:10:13.640
- I don't know. L... I can't...
- Listen...

01:10:14.090 --> 01:10:18.520
...have you got a little place where
we could go talk for just a minute?

01:10:20.390 --> 01:10:22.190
Come on.

01:10:22.360 --> 01:10:23.850
Yeah.

01:10:25.230 --> 01:10:26.820
Yeah.

01:10:28.530 --> 01:10:32.260
Look at you, you're the manager.
I mean, that's fabulous.

01:10:32.440 --> 01:10:36.740
You know, and you look real pretty,
like your mom.

01:10:37.480 --> 01:10:39.310
You turned out great, Gracie.

01:10:39.480 --> 01:10:42.040
No thanks to you.
There's no smoking in here.

01:10:42.210 --> 01:10:43.540
Come on, don't be mad.

01:10:43.710 --> 01:10:47.450
You know, I just... I couldn't see you
because of the restraining order.

01:10:47.620 --> 01:10:50.020
- They'd have put me in jail.
- You beat me.

01:10:50.190 --> 01:10:52.750
No, no, no. Your mom beat you.

01:10:53.460 --> 01:10:54.690
Is that true?

01:10:55.660 --> 01:10:58.960
Sweetie, I've just been
thinking about you all these years...

01:10:59.130 --> 01:11:02.260
...and waiting until you was 18
so that I could see you.

01:11:02.630 --> 01:11:04.900
Have you ever heard of a phone call?

01:11:05.070 --> 01:11:09.230
Jeez. Gracie, you know, I kind of had
some problems of my own for a while!

01:11:13.640 --> 01:11:16.440
But, you know, the thing is,
now your mom...

01:11:16.610 --> 01:11:19.740
She's trying to stick me
with this back child-support thing.

01:11:19.920 --> 01:11:22.720
She's claiming that Rosie
and the boys are my kids.

01:11:22.890 --> 01:11:24.860
Well, you know they're not, right?

01:11:25.320 --> 01:11:27.220
So, what I need...

01:11:27.430 --> 01:11:33.920
I just need you to sign this thing
that says that I was long gone...

01:11:34.100 --> 01:11:36.900
This is why you came to see me?

01:11:37.230 --> 01:11:40.730
Well, she can't get away with it,
because they're not my kids.

01:11:40.910 --> 01:11:42.430
No, they're mine!

01:11:53.480 --> 01:11:56.540
Good luck with your
child support, Daddy.

01:12:08.300 --> 01:12:11.060
You guys, what is this?

01:12:11.240 --> 01:12:13.290
Well, wake up and smell the roses.

01:12:13.470 --> 01:12:16.300
Congratulations!

01:12:16.470 --> 01:12:18.410
- Thank you.
- You have to stay in bed.

01:12:18.580 --> 01:12:23.450
- Breakfast in bed, like on TV.
- Oh, my goodness. One, four, three.

01:12:23.610 --> 01:12:25.980
- Come here.
- One, four, three, Gracie.

01:12:26.150 --> 01:12:28.350
This looks delicious.

01:12:30.690 --> 01:12:32.050
Jarrod Tarlaton.

01:12:38.600 --> 01:12:41.090
Gracie Thompson.

01:12:41.270 --> 01:12:44.330
Yeah! All right, Gracie!

01:12:44.500 --> 01:12:45.800
All right, Gracie!

01:12:50.310 --> 01:12:53.400
Your parents must be very proud.

01:12:53.610 --> 01:12:55.600
Exactly.

01:13:07.120 --> 01:13:10.320
- Gracie!
- Hey, there you are.

01:13:10.490 --> 01:13:13.690
- Hold it. Hold it, guys. I want to get this.
- Cheese!

01:13:14.330 --> 01:13:16.630
- Beautiful.
- I am so proud of you.

01:13:16.800 --> 01:13:19.200
- Congratulations.
- I told you you could do it.

01:13:19.370 --> 01:13:23.030
- Hey, there's punch in the corner.
- Gracie, Tommy, there you are.

01:13:23.210 --> 01:13:25.540
- Congratulations.
- Thank you, Mrs. Thurston.

01:13:25.710 --> 01:13:28.110
- Let's get a picture.
- I'm so proud of you.

01:13:28.280 --> 01:13:31.150
I am sorry I was a pain in the ass.
I hated your guts.

01:13:31.320 --> 01:13:34.010
Don't worry about it.
I hated yours too.

01:13:34.190 --> 01:13:37.210
I got a job this summer
doing books for an escrow company.

01:13:37.390 --> 01:13:40.360
This from the girl who once told me
she couldn't do math?

01:13:40.520 --> 01:13:43.150
I'm loading numbers into a computer,
that's all.

01:13:43.330 --> 01:13:47.060
Whatever it is, you're starting a new life
and with a new scholarship.

01:13:47.230 --> 01:13:49.960
Now, that is the best news.

01:13:51.670 --> 01:13:54.260
You proud of that? I can't believe it.

01:13:54.440 --> 01:13:58.340
Boys, do you want to say hello
to Mrs. Thurston? Say hello.

01:13:58.510 --> 01:14:00.880
Hi, Mrs. Thurston.

01:14:02.050 --> 01:14:03.950
So when were you gonna tell me?

01:14:04.120 --> 01:14:05.840
I don't know.

01:14:06.480 --> 01:14:10.680
- I just got all messed up.
- You found out you got a scholarship...

01:14:10.860 --> 01:14:12.190
...and you threw it away?

01:14:12.360 --> 01:14:15.330
How do I go to college
and leave the boys? A few years...

01:14:15.490 --> 01:14:19.260
Robbie's 7 years old.
That's a long time, Gracie.

01:14:21.700 --> 01:14:23.030
Look, I just gotta know.

01:14:26.270 --> 01:14:29.030
Do you love me or not?

01:14:30.210 --> 01:14:32.110
Tommy, you know that I do.

01:14:33.480 --> 01:14:36.110
Say it, Gracie.

01:14:43.890 --> 01:14:47.290
But I can't turn my back on the boys.
Even if I wanted to, I can't.

01:14:47.460 --> 01:14:49.860
Let somebody adopt them.

01:14:50.530 --> 01:14:52.090
It's a good opportunity...

01:14:52.260 --> 01:14:54.750
If anybody's gonna adopt them,
it's gonna be me.

01:14:57.170 --> 01:14:59.100
Do you know what you just said?

01:15:02.570 --> 01:15:03.870
So you're serious.

01:15:04.040 --> 01:15:08.440
- You're gonna try and adopt them yourself?
- I don't know what I'm gonna do.

01:15:12.650 --> 01:15:14.780
Look, the boys adore you...

01:15:14.950 --> 01:15:17.890
...and I know that you love them.
- I love you, damn it!

01:15:18.060 --> 01:15:21.390
I want to be with you!
I want to marry you!

01:15:21.660 --> 01:15:24.820
I want us to have our own kids,
not with them.

01:15:25.530 --> 01:15:28.620
- Tommy, don't say that.
- You've got to make a choice.

01:15:28.800 --> 01:15:31.100
Look, I'm sorry, Gracie.

01:15:31.340 --> 01:15:33.100
I'm only 19.

01:15:33.640 --> 01:15:35.570
Got my whole life ahead of me.

01:15:35.740 --> 01:15:37.710
I can't.

01:15:47.720 --> 01:15:52.520
Gracie, your family is ruining your life.

01:15:56.290 --> 01:15:58.190
You don't even see it.

01:16:09.370 --> 01:16:11.240
You expect me to take this pro bono?

01:16:11.510 --> 01:16:13.310
I don't expect anything. I'm hoping.

01:16:13.480 --> 01:16:16.340
- Do you know your mom will sign a release?
- I don't.

01:16:16.510 --> 01:16:19.280
The only way she'd sign it
is if she was high on pot.

01:16:19.450 --> 01:16:22.650
They'll assign her a lawyer.
You only get one shot in court.

01:16:22.820 --> 01:16:25.720
You'd have to luck out
with an understanding judge.

01:16:25.890 --> 01:16:28.380
- We had one before.
- And what about the fathers?

01:16:28.560 --> 01:16:31.820
I don't know who half of them are.
Neither does my mother.

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:36.260
You have to get a hold of relatives. You
have to check out last known addresses.

01:16:36.430 --> 01:16:38.490
You have to put ads in newspapers.

01:16:38.670 --> 01:16:42.470
You've got to locate these people
so parental rights can be terminated.

01:16:42.640 --> 01:16:45.340
- Ancillary costs can add up.
- I know. I'm prepared.

01:16:45.510 --> 01:16:48.640
I went through all of this stuff
with an adoption worker.

01:16:48.810 --> 01:16:52.300
There's little or no precedent for this.
A person as young as you...

01:16:52.480 --> 01:16:54.680
Are you gonna help me or not?

01:17:00.020 --> 01:17:01.960
Robbie?

01:17:02.890 --> 01:17:06.420
Don't wrinkle it. I just ironed it.
It's an expensive shirt.

01:17:06.600 --> 01:17:07.860
Belonged to my boss.

01:17:08.530 --> 01:17:11.190
Come on. We gotta get going.
We can't be late.

01:17:11.370 --> 01:17:14.240
- It got a big stain.
- Tuck it in and it won't show.

01:17:14.410 --> 01:17:18.430
- Why can't we ever get anything new?
- Why don't you start mowing more lawns?

01:17:18.610 --> 01:17:22.440
- Are you scrubbed good behind your ears?
- My hair okay?

01:17:22.880 --> 01:17:24.350
What is that smell?

01:17:24.520 --> 01:17:27.380
I used some of Tommy's cologne
he left in the bathroom.

01:17:27.550 --> 01:17:31.420
- Well, you used too much.
- Is Mom gonna be there?

01:17:37.830 --> 01:17:39.420
Come on.

01:17:41.070 --> 01:17:43.400
All right, I want you to sit over here.

01:17:43.570 --> 01:17:46.540
You're in charge.
Do not talk to anyone, okay?

01:17:46.700 --> 01:17:49.870
Excuse me, while I go barf my guts out.

01:18:05.020 --> 01:18:06.990
Would you mind if I had two of those?

01:18:07.160 --> 01:18:08.390
- Aspirin?
- Yeah.

01:18:08.560 --> 01:18:09.790
Yeah, sure.

01:18:16.030 --> 01:18:20.490
I come here this morning
thinking I was doing some good...

01:18:20.900 --> 01:18:23.840
...and they took my children away
from me.

01:18:25.580 --> 01:18:29.480
What kind of people take babies
away from their mothers?

01:18:33.250 --> 01:18:34.880
I don't...

01:18:36.720 --> 01:18:38.020
Sorry.

01:18:38.190 --> 01:18:39.490
I mean...

01:18:41.130 --> 01:18:44.960
I hope... I hope it works out for you.

01:18:48.370 --> 01:18:51.930
It's a great idea. Gracie's gonna love it.

01:18:52.100 --> 01:18:55.090
- Hi, Gracie.
- Look who's here, Gracie.

01:18:55.270 --> 01:18:57.430
Well, hi there, Gracie.

01:18:57.610 --> 01:18:59.470
Hey, what do you think?

01:18:59.640 --> 01:19:03.310
- They said I should look respectable.
- She looks pretty, doesn't she?

01:19:03.480 --> 01:19:06.780
I do feel like my mother.
Maybe I should add more lipstick.

01:19:06.950 --> 01:19:10.980
- You're beautiful, Mom.
- You look... You look fine.

01:19:11.160 --> 01:19:14.220
- Mom wants to take us to Wyoming.
- Well...

01:19:14.890 --> 01:19:16.290
We could all go.

01:19:16.890 --> 01:19:19.450
Gracie, you too. You're invited.

01:19:19.630 --> 01:19:22.260
- We could start over.
- We can take Lobo.

01:19:22.430 --> 01:19:26.030
She's gonna sell Grandma Lou's house
and buy one in Wyoming.

01:19:26.200 --> 01:19:32.400
We're gonna have a ranch house with
cottonwood trees and a pond and a pasture.

01:19:32.580 --> 01:19:34.740
We're gonna have a huge garden.

01:19:34.910 --> 01:19:37.310
Because we'll grow
all of our own food, right?

01:19:37.480 --> 01:19:41.320
Oh, and she says we're gonna have horses.
Arabian horses like Shamire.

01:19:41.490 --> 01:19:43.720
Yes, yes, yes.

01:19:45.360 --> 01:19:48.050
I know I wasn't a good mother...

01:19:49.090 --> 01:19:52.090
...but like I told the boys, I loved you.

01:19:53.130 --> 01:19:55.860
I love all of my children.

01:19:59.140 --> 01:20:01.540
I'm gonna make up for it now.

01:20:03.940 --> 01:20:06.500
Please don't do this.

01:20:11.550 --> 01:20:15.180
I'll raise them like I was raised.
My parents were good Christians.

01:20:15.350 --> 01:20:19.410
I had a good upbringing. It's just that
I got a little off track, that's all.

01:20:19.590 --> 01:20:22.620
- I'm in a parenting class now.
- You've only attended once.

01:20:22.790 --> 01:20:25.990
Well, that's because I only found out
about it in the end...

01:20:26.160 --> 01:20:30.400
...but I'm gonna go
to the next session, I swear.

01:20:31.170 --> 01:20:34.300
Judge Marks, this is all a mistake.

01:20:34.470 --> 01:20:38.870
I want my kids. I want to give them
a good life. I've always wanted that.

01:20:39.040 --> 01:20:42.710
Are you prepared to get a job?
You won't raise them on welfare.

01:20:42.880 --> 01:20:46.610
Well, I'm taking it one step at a time.

01:20:47.380 --> 01:20:48.870
Thank you.

01:20:49.050 --> 01:20:50.780
Thank you.

01:20:52.160 --> 01:20:54.820
Will any of the children's fathers
be present here?

01:20:54.990 --> 01:20:57.760
Oh, golly, no, no, no.

01:20:57.930 --> 01:21:01.960
No, they owe me way too much
child support. I never had a penny.

01:21:02.130 --> 01:21:06.160
But I will tell you that these kids
were conceived in love.

01:21:07.670 --> 01:21:11.270
I understand, but according to the petition
signed by your daughter...

01:21:11.440 --> 01:21:13.410
Oh, yes, I read that.

01:21:13.580 --> 01:21:17.840
Gracie is a good kid,
but that's all she is is a kid.

01:21:18.580 --> 01:21:23.780
If you don't see me fit to raise the children,
they should go to families that'll help them.

01:21:23.950 --> 01:21:25.650
No one helped them more than I.

01:21:25.820 --> 01:21:29.120
Please. I've gone over dozens of reports
from social workers.

01:21:29.290 --> 01:21:32.490
They'll tell you I've been the one
that's been responsible...

01:21:32.660 --> 01:21:36.760
...for feeding and clothing them.
I get them to school. It has always been me.

01:21:36.930 --> 01:21:39.660
You should know that she has sex
with a boy in the...

01:21:39.840 --> 01:21:42.770
- That is not the way it went! He loved me!
- Yes, it is!

01:21:42.940 --> 01:21:45.140
- It is the way it is.
- And I loved him.

01:21:45.710 --> 01:21:49.700
Will counsel on both sides please
try to get a grip on your clients?

01:21:49.880 --> 01:21:51.640
Miss Larson.

01:21:51.820 --> 01:21:54.810
I'd like to call the children
to the courtroom.

01:21:57.320 --> 01:21:58.690
Let's.

01:22:01.990 --> 01:22:05.020
Boys, the judge wants to see you.

01:22:05.200 --> 01:22:08.100
- Come on.
- Come on, Robbie.

01:22:09.730 --> 01:22:11.720
Ryan Walker...

01:22:12.200 --> 01:22:14.300
...Jonny Blicker...

01:22:14.940 --> 01:22:16.740
...and Robbie Locascio...

01:22:16.910 --> 01:22:20.400
...you've been sworn in,
and I've explained what that means.

01:22:21.210 --> 01:22:26.340
Now I'm going to ask each of you
a very hard question.

01:22:26.520 --> 01:22:30.650
Ryan, you're the eldest,
so I'm going to ask you first.

01:22:32.520 --> 01:22:34.110
Who do you want to live with?

01:22:45.500 --> 01:22:47.090
One, four, three.

01:22:49.310 --> 01:22:51.540
I love you, Mom.

01:22:51.710 --> 01:22:53.510
I will always love you.

01:22:54.780 --> 01:22:58.680
I'm sorry,
but I would rather live with Gracie.

01:23:01.490 --> 01:23:03.010
What?

01:23:06.560 --> 01:23:09.790
Well, he's been brainwashed.
Wait, wait, wait.

01:23:09.960 --> 01:23:13.950
- Jonny, what about you?
- Jonny. Jon, Jon, Jon. Now, look at me.

01:23:14.130 --> 01:23:16.460
- Miss Larson!
- Look at your mother.

01:23:17.770 --> 01:23:20.240
Clearly, she has... She's...

01:23:20.400 --> 01:23:24.270
She's poisoned them or brainwashed them
to be scared of me...

01:23:24.440 --> 01:23:28.040
- Counsel, I've warned you.
...and told them that I am bad.

01:23:30.110 --> 01:23:34.210
I'm not bad. I'm not bad.
I'm just looking for another chance.

01:23:35.720 --> 01:23:39.990
One more chance, please, to be
their mother. Boys, come to me.

01:23:40.160 --> 01:23:41.990
Jonny...

01:23:42.330 --> 01:23:43.760
...come to me, my babies.

01:23:45.500 --> 01:23:46.930
Boys.

01:23:47.100 --> 01:23:50.160
Boys, I know this is going
to be very difficult...

01:23:50.330 --> 01:23:52.830
...but ignore what your mother
just said to you.

01:23:53.140 --> 01:23:56.040
Just try and stay with your feelings.

01:23:57.040 --> 01:23:58.800
Jonny...

01:23:59.110 --> 01:24:00.870
...who do you want to live with?

01:24:02.410 --> 01:24:06.280
Your Honor, we've been with Gracie
all our lives.

01:24:06.450 --> 01:24:10.280
She feeds us and reads to us...

01:24:10.450 --> 01:24:13.720
...and helps us with our lessons.

01:24:14.420 --> 01:24:19.590
She fixes us up when we're hurt
and when we're scared.

01:24:19.760 --> 01:24:22.430
That's what a mother does, right?

01:24:22.600 --> 01:24:25.530
She changed our diapers
when we were babies.

01:24:26.300 --> 01:24:29.170
- Mom, you know that's true.
- Robbie?

01:24:30.070 --> 01:24:32.510
Robbie, what do you say about this?

01:24:32.680 --> 01:24:36.740
Robbie, pay attention.
Who do you want to live with?

01:24:36.910 --> 01:24:40.210
I would like to live in Wyoming
and ride a horse.

01:24:41.280 --> 01:24:43.840
- Wyoming?
- Yeah, it would be fun.

01:24:44.350 --> 01:24:46.080
Yeah, yeah.

01:24:46.260 --> 01:24:51.350
But I would like to sleep in my own bed
and go home with Gracie.

01:25:00.670 --> 01:25:03.070
I can take care of it.

01:25:05.910 --> 01:25:09.640
I've been with this case
for some time now.

01:25:09.980 --> 01:25:15.250
It seems the children
have finally found some stability.

01:25:15.950 --> 01:25:18.180
I don't want to disrupt that.

01:25:18.360 --> 01:25:22.720
Miss Larson, I know you feel
pain and remorse...

01:25:22.890 --> 01:25:25.760
...but it's all coming too late.

01:25:27.500 --> 01:25:29.690
Parental rights are terminated.

01:25:37.070 --> 01:25:41.370
Is that...? Is that it?

01:25:48.190 --> 01:25:51.550
I can't see my babies anymore?

01:25:55.760 --> 01:25:58.850
You're not my babies anymore?

01:25:59.530 --> 01:26:01.760
Oh, God!

01:26:10.670 --> 01:26:13.870
I love you, my boys. I love you.

01:26:16.480 --> 01:26:21.140
I will always find you.
No matter where you go, I will find you.

01:26:44.110 --> 01:26:46.630
I hope you know
what you're doing today.

01:26:46.810 --> 01:26:49.240
This is a huge thing you're taking on.

01:26:49.410 --> 01:26:53.350
There's no turning back.
These will be your children now.

01:26:53.520 --> 01:26:55.640
I understand.

01:26:55.820 --> 01:26:57.720
They've always been my children.

01:26:58.120 --> 01:27:00.920
They've never been anyone else's.

01:27:01.590 --> 01:27:03.750
Now, can we blow this joint?

01:27:07.760 --> 01:27:11.030
- He means, are we done?
- Almost.

01:27:11.470 --> 01:27:13.870
- Diesel, like Vin Diesel.
- That's stupid.

01:27:14.040 --> 01:27:16.560
- Potter, like Harry.
- Guys, we gotta get serious.

01:27:16.740 --> 01:27:19.270
We have five minutes
to come up with a last name.

01:27:19.440 --> 01:27:21.770
- Lobo.
- That's the cat's name.

01:27:21.950 --> 01:27:23.810
Savage.

01:27:24.380 --> 01:27:26.080
Jonny Savage.

01:27:26.250 --> 01:27:30.120
No, how about Weatherly?

01:27:32.090 --> 01:27:34.420
Because we've been through
bad weather.

01:27:34.590 --> 01:27:37.920
- Weatherly. Jonny Weatherly. Okay.
- Okay with me.

01:27:38.090 --> 01:27:39.650
All right, Weatherly.

01:27:42.970 --> 01:27:45.130
Weatherly, Your Honor.

01:27:48.870 --> 01:27:51.810
Ladies and gentlemen of the courtroom,
for the record...

01:27:51.980 --> 01:27:54.600
...l'm happy to present
the Weatherly family.

01:27:54.780 --> 01:27:56.540
- Yes.
- Yes.

01:27:56.710 --> 01:27:58.180
Gracie Weatherly...

01:27:58.350 --> 01:27:59.980
...Ryan Weatherly...

01:28:00.150 --> 01:28:02.480
...Jonny Weatherly...
- Yes!

01:28:02.650 --> 01:28:04.350
...and Robbie Weatherly.

01:28:04.520 --> 01:28:07.390
This is a miracle. It's a first.

01:28:07.560 --> 01:28:10.890
I want to see you guys
when you graduate.

01:28:11.060 --> 01:28:13.550
It's heroic what you're doing.

01:28:13.730 --> 01:28:18.260
I wondered, when I was
reading the case...

01:28:18.440 --> 01:28:22.530
...if I'd make a mistake by granting this.

01:28:23.440 --> 01:28:27.040
But I know in my heart
I've made the right decision.

01:28:28.610 --> 01:28:33.850
- I just hope you can handle it.
- I will. I can do it.

01:28:34.020 --> 01:28:36.010
It's gonna be hard.

01:28:36.490 --> 01:28:39.550
You've got your own little family now.

01:28:39.720 --> 01:28:42.450
You can make it happen.

01:29:06.720 --> 01:29:10.680
We are proud to present the Weatherlys!
