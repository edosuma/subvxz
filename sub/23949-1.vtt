09:39.033 --> 09:40.194
Try to sing.

09:40.200 --> 09:41.028
You try to sing?

09:41.034 --> 09:43.033
In the shower and the car.

09:43.617 --> 09:45.027
I kinda wanna hear you.

09:45.033 --> 09:46.820
No, I won't do it unless you do it.

09:46.826 --> 09:47.779
I'll totally do it.

09:47.785 --> 09:49.027
What's your favorite thing to sing?

09:49.033 --> 09:50.945
Any song on in the car,

09:50.951 --> 09:52.027
"I wanna dance with somebody".

09:52.033 --> 09:53.236

Oh my gosh okay

10:47.026 --> 10:49.905
I was nervous 'cause I've never
been on a blind date before.

10:49.968 --> 10:52.127
And then the fact that he was so cute.

10:52.243 --> 10:54.784
Like, he was, he is cute.

10:54.854 --> 10:56.472
So yeah, whenever I sat down,

10:56.478 --> 10:59.430
I could just feel myself blushing,

10:59.436 --> 11:00.099
Ohh!

11:00.105 --> 11:02.138
But, get this, he sings.

11:02.144 --> 11:03.472
Was there chemistry, like

11:03.478 --> 11:04.139
I think so.

11:04.145 --> 11:06.264
Do you think he was into you?

11:06.270 --> 11:07.265
I hope so! I don't know.

11:07.271 --> 11:09.472
- Oh good.
- I wanna know more.

11:09.478 --> 11:11.973
It's the first date so I didn't tell him

11:11.979 --> 11:12.598
everything about me.

11:12.604 --> 11:15.014
We didn't talk about like,
waiting for marriage.

11:15.020 --> 11:18.879
When have you in the past
told guys you were waiting?

11:18.949 --> 11:20.551
I think it just naturally comes up.

11:20.653 --> 11:22.939
You know like, "hey I'm
Jessica, by the way..."

11:22.945 --> 11:24.482
"I'm a 29 year old virgin."

11:24.488 --> 11:26.565
Yeah, well thank you Rach.

11:26.571 --> 11:27.523
No it's a good thing!

11:27.529 --> 11:27.981
No it is.

11:27.987 --> 11:28.731
It's a great thing.

11:28.737 --> 11:29.732
It is you're right.

11:29.738 --> 11:31.357
I want, like, what you and Kerry have.

11:31.363 --> 11:32.024
That's special you know.

11:32.030 --> 11:33.898
The perfect little family.

11:33.904 --> 11:36.493
But one person kinda has to have a...

11:36.594 --> 11:37.585
A what?!

11:40.091 --> 11:42.168
Were you gonna say "a real job"?!

11:43.175 --> 11:45.167
I don't know, I appreciate dreamers.

11:45.173 --> 11:47.167
I mean that's why we live in Nashville.

11:47.173 --> 11:50.167
Be around people who
have these big ideas

11:50.173 --> 11:51.086
of what they're gonna do.

11:51.092 --> 11:52.585
Which is why I wanna
go to law school but,

11:52.591 --> 11:55.167
When did you decide
you wanted to do that?

11:55.173 --> 11:58.877
A long time ago, I took my first LSAT

11:58.883 --> 12:01.209
and found out I was
pregnant the next day.

12:01.215 --> 12:02.251
And I was gonna put it on hold until

12:02.257 --> 12:06.960
Wolfgang was like five so
that I could be with him.

12:06.966 --> 12:07.419
But I can't.

12:07.425 --> 12:10.002
You're just like ready.

12:10.008 --> 12:12.173
I'm, ugh, yeah.

12:12.340 --> 12:14.173
I can't wait any more.

12:32.278 --> 12:33.273
Yeah I know,

12:33.279 --> 12:34.481
I'm trying to button this thing.

12:34.487 --> 12:35.982
You need help?

12:35.988 --> 12:38.272
No, hold on, okay.

12:38.278 --> 12:39.481
You are never gonna believe

12:39.487 --> 12:41.946
what I am wearing!

12:42.154 --> 12:43.272
Is that Aunt Sharon's?

12:43.278 --> 12:45.439
She wore this when she
was crowned Miss NC, USA.

12:45.445 --> 12:46.440
That's so awesome.

12:46.446 --> 12:48.272
But it was long and
then it was long sleeved,

12:48.278 --> 12:49.273
it had a turtle neck.

12:49.279 --> 12:51.398
I have the fabric right here.

12:51.404 --> 12:53.190
We took off like four feet.

12:53.196 --> 12:56.564
It was terrifying but I
mean, I think it worked out.

12:56.570 --> 12:58.023
I'm hoping that it'll just be like,

12:58.029 --> 12:58.983
a good luck charm, you know.

12:58.989 --> 13:00.356
Having my mom's gown
that she was crowned in

13:00.362 --> 13:02.190
and competing for the same title.

13:02.196 --> 13:04.523
You know, I kinda have someone that

13:04.529 --> 13:07.272
I might want to go
with me to the pageant.

13:07.278 --> 13:08.108
Hmm.

13:08.114 --> 13:09.190
She's a beautiful, Southern girl.

13:09.196 --> 13:11.439
And let me guess, she's also blonde.

13:11.445 --> 13:12.982
She's also blonde.

13:12.988 --> 13:14.404
Go figure.

13:14.612 --> 13:15.982
What does she do?

13:15.988 --> 13:17.606
She's a musician,

13:17.612 --> 13:19.940
or pursuing a career in music.

13:19.946 --> 13:21.272
Oh my gosh.

13:21.278 --> 13:21.983
What?

13:21.989 --> 13:23.148
That is just what Nashville needs

13:23.154 --> 13:24.481
is one more dreamer coming to the city

13:24.487 --> 13:25.648
and tryna be a musician.

13:25.654 --> 13:26.524
Stop be open minded!

13:26.530 --> 13:29.232
You're gonna start not showering and

13:29.238 --> 13:32.272
move to some hippie part of Nashville.

13:32.278 --> 13:33.356
No, not gonna be that drastic,

13:33.362 --> 13:35.232
but you know, give her a chance.

13:35.238 --> 13:36.272
Whatever, I mean if you like her,

13:36.278 --> 13:38.523
then I'll have to see for myself.

13:38.529 --> 13:39.731
I hope so.

13:39.737 --> 13:44.107
I mean, Jackson your past relationships,

13:44.113 --> 13:45.314
it's no secret you've had some...

13:45.320 --> 13:48.272
You've had a few rocky
patches with the women.

13:48.278 --> 13:50.314
But no, she's not coming to Miss NC.

13:50.320 --> 13:53.320
Let's just keep that
open seat available.

13:56.404 --> 13:58.272

14:08.570 --> 14:11.023
Pretty psyched to come watch you

14:11.029 --> 14:13.232
and get out of the house!

14:13.238 --> 14:16.065
So do you have more
gigs this week in town?

14:16.071 --> 14:17.273
Or next week?

14:17.279 --> 14:21.654
I have no gigs in
town other than tonight.

14:22.278 --> 14:24.272
And that is an excellent
segue point into

14:24.278 --> 14:28.272
telling you that I have accepted a tour

14:28.278 --> 14:31.190
that leaves next week
and I will be gone,

14:31.196 --> 14:33.278
a little bit longer than normal.

14:35.278 --> 14:35.774
Like how long?

14:35.780 --> 14:38.481
And by that I mean about six weeks.

14:38.487 --> 14:40.190
Why are you laughing?

14:40.196 --> 14:43.278
Anticipation of the wrath.

14:47.278 --> 14:50.272
Why are you just now telling me?

14:50.278 --> 14:51.690
Found out a few days ago.

14:51.696 --> 14:53.439
I've just kind been waiting.

14:53.445 --> 14:55.731
What the hell you told me last time

14:55.737 --> 14:57.148
you would tell me right away,

14:57.154 --> 14:58.773
so we can talk about it together.

14:58.779 --> 14:59.732
They needed an answer.

14:59.738 --> 15:02.148
I needed to take it
before it was passed on.

15:02.154 --> 15:03.356
I'm sure you had 10
minutes to text me or...

15:03.362 --> 15:05.272
Before it was passed on to someone else.

15:05.278 --> 15:07.272
It's kinda, they give you a short window

15:07.278 --> 15:08.731
to get as much traction as you can,

15:08.737 --> 15:13.398
and that's not by turning
down opportunities that are...

15:13.404 --> 15:15.278
...good for us.

15:15.570 --> 15:16.273
Us?

15:16.279 --> 15:18.314
Us. It's us. We're a family.

15:18.320 --> 15:20.273
You told me we were moving
to Nashville for music

15:20.279 --> 15:24.272
and I support that and I want
you to pursue your dreams.

15:24.278 --> 15:28.398
But I had no idea this is what that was.

15:28.404 --> 15:30.648
I didn't realize, I didn't
really sign up for this.

15:30.654 --> 15:34.320
I didn't sign up to be
by myself in Nashville.

15:35.238 --> 15:36.278
All the time.

15:36.404 --> 15:38.564
I mean like do you even
recognize me anymore?

15:38.570 --> 15:41.314
Am I even the person that
you met in Los Angeles?

15:41.320 --> 15:43.272
I'm not even the same person.

15:43.278 --> 15:44.273
I don't even know what that means,

15:44.279 --> 15:45.856
but if you can tell me specifically...

15:45.862 --> 15:47.272
All I do is chores, I literally-

15:47.278 --> 15:48.690
You tell me specifically what you want

15:48.696 --> 15:50.232
and what you need and
then we can compromise.

15:50.238 --> 15:52.856
I want me and you to
do fun stuff together

15:52.862 --> 15:55.272
like we used to do when we met.

15:55.278 --> 15:57.272
I have to play my show tonight.

15:57.278 --> 15:59.606
And then we have the
rest of the weekend to...

16:34.779 --> 16:36.856
Kerry just dropped a bomb that

16:36.862 --> 16:40.606
he's leaving in like
a week for six weeks.

16:40.612 --> 16:41.648
Six weeks is a long time!

16:41.654 --> 16:45.273
Yeah if you had a boyfriend
or husband or whatever

16:45.279 --> 16:47.272
and you were gonna leave for six weeks,

16:47.278 --> 16:49.898
don't you think you'll
call them right away?

16:49.904 --> 16:50.774
Yeah the first thing I'm doing

16:50.780 --> 16:52.564
is calling my significant other.

16:52.570 --> 16:54.523
You knew you were signing up for this.

16:54.529 --> 16:57.606
I didn't know what
life as a musician was.

16:57.612 --> 16:58.731
It's not like you can stop him.

16:58.737 --> 16:59.439
Would you stop him?

16:59.445 --> 17:00.273
I wouldn't stop him.

17:00.279 --> 17:01.648
I'm excited I married an artist,

17:01.654 --> 17:02.565
I wanna be with an artist,

17:02.571 --> 17:04.606
you know I wanna support him.

17:04.612 --> 17:07.271
But communication is huge, you know.

17:07.278 --> 17:09.772
What on earth are you gonna do?

17:09.779 --> 17:11.522
I don't know.

17:11.529 --> 17:14.731
Yeah we didn't really
conclude, it was just...

17:14.737 --> 17:17.820
"See you in six weeks"?

17:24.278 --> 17:26.271
Thank you so much for coming out.
