00:09.500 --> 00:11.417
Computer, dispatches.

00:11.458 --> 00:13.000
A research inquiry

00:13.041 --> 00:15.458
from the Manitoba Journal

00:13.041 --> 00:15.458
of Interplanetary Psychology

00:15.500 --> 00:18.291
and three communiques

00:15.500 --> 00:18.291
from your mother.

00:21.917 --> 00:24.834
Transfer the letters from

00:21.917 --> 00:24.834
my mother to the view screen.

00:28.917 --> 00:34.834
And computer, I would like

00:28.917 --> 00:34.834
a real chocolate sundae.

00:34.875 --> 00:38.125
Define "real" in context,

00:34.875 --> 00:38.125
please.

00:38.166 --> 00:39.500
Real.

00:39.542 --> 00:42.709
Not one of your

00:39.542 --> 00:42.709
perfectly synthesized

00:42.750 --> 00:46.041
ingeniously enhanced

00:42.750 --> 00:46.041
imitations.

00:47.959 --> 00:52.208
I would like

00:47.959 --> 00:52.208
real chocolate ice cream,

00:52.250 --> 00:54.458
real whipped cream...

00:54.500 --> 00:55.959
This unit is programmed

00:56.000 --> 00:58.959
to provide sources

00:56.000 --> 00:58.959
of acceptable nutritional value.

00:59.000 --> 01:02.208
Your request does not fall

00:59.000 --> 01:02.208
within current guidelines.

01:02.250 --> 01:03.709
Please indicate whether

01:02.250 --> 01:03.709
you wish

01:03.750 --> 01:05.834
to override

01:03.750 --> 01:05.834
the specified program.

01:05.875 --> 01:07.041
Listen--

01:07.083 --> 01:09.750
PICARD:

01:07.083 --> 01:09.750
Picard to Counselor Troi.

01:09.792 --> 01:12.375
Now what?

01:12.417 --> 01:14.166
Yes, Captain?

01:14.208 --> 01:15.875
The pleasure of your company

01:14.208 --> 01:15.875
is requested, Counselor.

01:15.917 --> 01:18.417
We are, um... we're having

01:15.917 --> 01:18.417
an little impromptu reception

01:18.458 --> 01:20.417
for the arriving delegates.

01:20.458 --> 01:22.583
Captain, I'm not really

01:20.458 --> 01:22.583
dressed for a reception.

01:22.625 --> 01:24.959
Oh, Counselor,

01:22.625 --> 01:24.959
just throw on any old thing.

01:25.000 --> 01:27.250
We're about to get

01:25.000 --> 01:27.250
our first look at the wormhole.

01:27.291 --> 01:28.792
Of course, Captain.

01:28.834 --> 01:30.792
I'm on my way.

01:33.125 --> 01:37.458
God forbid I should miss

01:33.125 --> 01:37.458
my first look at the wormhole.

01:41.750 --> 01:43.375
May I escort you,

01:41.750 --> 01:43.375
Miss Troi?

01:43.417 --> 01:44.959
Just tell me there's

01:43.417 --> 01:44.959
some chocolate here.

01:45.041 --> 01:46.500
PICARD:

01:45.041 --> 01:46.500
Ah, Counselor Troi.

01:46.542 --> 01:49.500
Will you allow me to do

01:46.542 --> 01:49.500
the introductions?

01:49.542 --> 01:51.291
This is Premier Bhavani

01:49.542 --> 01:51.291
of Barzan.

01:51.333 --> 01:52.875
Counselor Deanna Troi.

01:52.917 --> 01:54.291
Your discovery has produced

01:54.333 --> 01:56.709
a great deal of excitement,

01:54.333 --> 01:56.709
Premier.

01:56.750 --> 01:58.083
Hopefully it will

01:56.750 --> 01:58.083
also produce

01:58.125 --> 02:01.041
a new era of prosperity

01:58.125 --> 02:01.041
for my people.

02:01.083 --> 02:02.875
We'll see to that.

02:02.917 --> 02:05.667
You know Mr. Mendoza,

02:02.917 --> 02:05.667
the Federation negotiator.

02:05.709 --> 02:08.625
A pleasure to see you again,

02:05.709 --> 02:08.625
Counselor Troi.

02:08.667 --> 02:11.667
This is a worthy Federation

02:08.667 --> 02:11.667
competitor in the bidding,

02:11.709 --> 02:13.792
Leyor of

02:11.709 --> 02:13.792
the Caldonians.

02:13.834 --> 02:15.208
Madam.

02:15.250 --> 02:18.083
MAN:

02:15.250 --> 02:18.083
And I am

02:15.250 --> 02:18.083
Devinoni Ral.

02:21.500 --> 02:24.125
Ship's Counselor,

02:21.500 --> 02:24.125
Deanna Troi.

02:24.166 --> 02:25.625
MENDOZA:

02:24.166 --> 02:25.625
My good friend

02:24.166 --> 02:25.625
Ral is

02:25.667 --> 02:29.000
the best hired gun

02:25.667 --> 02:29.000
in the business.

02:29.041 --> 02:30.542
Hired gun?

02:30.583 --> 02:33.917
My good friend Mendoza means

02:30.583 --> 02:33.917
that I'm a negotiator

02:33.959 --> 02:36.417
who serves

02:33.959 --> 02:36.417
a variety of clients.

02:36.458 --> 02:39.542
On this particular occasion,

02:36.458 --> 02:39.542
I represent the Chrysalians.

02:39.583 --> 02:42.000
BHAVANI: I believe it's almost

02:39.583 --> 02:42.000
time, isn't it, Captain?

02:42.041 --> 02:43.208
Indeed.

02:43.250 --> 02:45.417
It will be visible

02:43.250 --> 02:45.417
directly ahead.

02:51.125 --> 02:52.875
Is it always on time,

02:51.125 --> 02:52.875
Bhavani?

02:52.917 --> 02:54.333
Always.

02:54.375 --> 02:58.417
We see it every

02:54.375 --> 02:58.417
233 minutes.

02:58.458 --> 02:59.834
Our scientists say

02:58.458 --> 02:59.834
it's due

02:59.875 --> 03:03.208
to radiation buildup

02:59.875 --> 03:03.208
in the accretion disk.

03:03.250 --> 03:06.333
The visible burst

03:03.250 --> 03:06.333
is very brief.

03:10.291 --> 03:13.041
There it is, ladies

03:10.291 --> 03:13.041
and gentlemen, the first

03:13.083 --> 03:16.709
and only stable wormhole

03:13.083 --> 03:16.709
known to exist.

03:17.834 --> 03:20.959
It's yours,

03:17.834 --> 03:20.959
for the right price.

03:53.417 --> 03:58.083
<i>Space, the final frontier.</i>

03:58.125 --> 04:02.500
<i>These are the voyages</i>

03:58.125 --> 04:02.500
<i>of the starship Enterprise.</i>

04:02.542 --> 04:03.750
<i>Its continuing mission--</i>

04:03.792 --> 04:07.583
<i>to explore</i>

04:03.792 --> 04:07.583
<i>strange new worlds,</i>

04:07.625 --> 04:12.208
<i>to seek out new life</i>

04:07.625 --> 04:12.208
<i>and new civilizations,</i>

04:12.250 --> 04:16.291
<i>to boldly go</i>

04:12.250 --> 04:16.291
<i>where no one has gone before.</i>

05:14.875 --> 05:17.667
<i>Captain's log,</i>

05:14.875 --> 05:17.667
<i>Stardate 43385.6.</i>

05:17.709 --> 05:20.834
<i>We are orbiting Barzan Two,</i>

05:17.709 --> 05:20.834
<i>which is entertaining bids</i>

05:20.875 --> 05:24.458
<i>for control of what appears</i>

05:20.875 --> 05:24.458
<i>to be a stable wormhole,</i>

05:24.500 --> 05:26.625
<i>which could provide</i>

05:24.500 --> 05:26.625
<i>a permanent shortcut</i>

05:26.667 --> 05:28.917
<i>to the distant</i>

05:26.667 --> 05:28.917
<i>Gamma Quadrant.</i>

05:28.959 --> 05:30.583
As you all know,

05:30.625 --> 05:32.375
the environment

05:30.625 --> 05:32.375
on my planet

05:32.417 --> 05:36.959
is completely inhospitable

05:32.417 --> 05:36.959
to most other life-forms.

05:37.000 --> 05:39.291
So I'd like to express

05:37.000 --> 05:39.291
my appreciation

05:39.333 --> 05:41.125
to you,

05:39.333 --> 05:41.125
Captain Picard,

05:41.166 --> 05:44.083
for hosting

05:41.166 --> 05:44.083
these negotiations.

05:44.125 --> 05:45.959
The Barzan has been

05:44.125 --> 05:45.959
a society

05:46.000 --> 05:48.917
dependent on others

05:46.000 --> 05:48.917
for generations.

05:48.959 --> 05:51.458
We want that to end.

05:51.500 --> 05:55.542
The appearance of this stable

05:51.500 --> 05:55.542
wormhole in our space

05:55.583 --> 05:59.792
provides us with our first

05:55.583 --> 05:59.792
true natural resource.

05:59.834 --> 06:01.834
We have neither

05:59.834 --> 06:01.834
the experience

06:01.875 --> 06:05.458
nor the technology

06:01.875 --> 06:05.458
to exploit it.

06:05.500 --> 06:07.208
But you do.

06:07.250 --> 06:08.458
RIKER:

06:07.250 --> 06:08.458
Excuse me.

06:08.500 --> 06:10.166
There's a delegation

06:08.500 --> 06:10.166
of Ferengi

06:10.208 --> 06:12.375
that wishes

06:10.208 --> 06:12.375
to be beamed aboard, sir.

06:14.458 --> 06:17.000
Were you expecting

06:14.458 --> 06:17.000
the Ferengi, Premier?

06:17.041 --> 06:20.834
No, but I do not wish

06:17.041 --> 06:20.834
to create ill will, Captain.

06:20.875 --> 06:22.166
If they are interested

06:20.875 --> 06:22.166
in bidding,

06:22.208 --> 06:23.542
I have no objection.

06:25.417 --> 06:27.959
Chief O'Brien,

06:25.417 --> 06:27.959
this is Captain Picard.

06:28.000 --> 06:29.625
Will you beam

06:28.000 --> 06:29.625
the Ferengi directly

06:29.667 --> 06:30.917
to the observation lounge?

06:30.959 --> 06:32.333
O'BRIEN:

06:30.959 --> 06:32.333
Aye, sir.

06:38.291 --> 06:40.959
On behalf of all Ferengi,

06:38.291 --> 06:40.959
I protest.

06:41.000 --> 06:42.834
Why were we not invited

06:41.000 --> 06:42.834
to these negotiations?

06:42.875 --> 06:44.417
BHAVANI:

06:42.875 --> 06:44.417
My apologies.

06:44.458 --> 06:46.542
We did not anticipate

06:44.458 --> 06:46.542
your interest.

06:46.583 --> 06:48.667
You're welcome

06:46.583 --> 06:48.667
to join us.

06:48.709 --> 06:50.333
My name is DaiMon Goss.

06:50.375 --> 06:53.709
And these are my consuls,

06:50.375 --> 06:53.709
Kol and Dr. Arridor.

06:53.750 --> 06:55.250
We'll need chairs.

06:55.291 --> 06:56.792
I'm Captain Picard

06:55.291 --> 06:56.792
of the<i> Enterprise.</i>

06:56.834 --> 06:59.208
I am serving as host

06:56.834 --> 06:59.208
for these proceedings.

06:59.250 --> 07:01.458
Good, then see to it

06:59.250 --> 07:01.458
we get some chairs.

07:01.500 --> 07:02.959
Let me explain--

07:03.000 --> 07:04.875
Fine, fine, just have

07:03.000 --> 07:04.875
your Klingon servant

07:04.917 --> 07:06.125
get us some chairs.

07:06.166 --> 07:08.542
I'm in charge

07:06.166 --> 07:08.542
of security.

07:08.583 --> 07:11.625
Then who gets

07:08.583 --> 07:11.625
the chairs?

07:11.667 --> 07:14.542
DaiMon, due to

07:11.667 --> 07:14.542
the delicate nature

07:14.583 --> 07:17.208
of these negotiations,

07:14.583 --> 07:17.208
all parties

07:17.250 --> 07:19.583
have agreed that

07:17.250 --> 07:19.583
one representative

07:19.625 --> 07:21.667
will suffice. Now I will

07:19.625 --> 07:21.667
be happy to provide

07:21.709 --> 07:23.041
your consuls

07:21.709 --> 07:23.041
with accommodations

07:23.083 --> 07:26.875
and<i> you</i> may have

07:23.083 --> 07:26.875
<i>my</i> chair.

07:26.917 --> 07:29.125
Very well.

07:29.166 --> 07:31.083
Premier.

07:35.417 --> 07:38.583
<i>( sighs )</i>

07:38.625 --> 07:40.417
Kol, the bag.

07:40.458 --> 07:42.792
RIKER:

07:40.458 --> 07:42.792
Gentlemen, this way.

07:42.834 --> 07:45.500
We can handle all

07:42.834 --> 07:45.500
the pleasantries later.

07:45.542 --> 07:48.125
Now, let's get

07:45.542 --> 07:48.125
down to business.

07:51.208 --> 07:53.208
I'll match anyone's

07:51.208 --> 07:53.208
best offer

07:53.250 --> 07:57.250
<i>and</i> add the gold

07:53.250 --> 07:57.250
on top of it.

07:58.500 --> 08:00.458

08:01.792 --> 08:04.792
COMPUTER:

08:01.792 --> 08:04.792
Devinoni Ral,

08:04.834 --> 08:07.291
Born Brussels,

(<i> door chimes</i> )

08:09.834 --> 08:11.834
Come in.

08:18.917 --> 08:21.041
Should I call

08:18.917 --> 08:21.041
for an appointment?

08:21.083 --> 08:23.041
No.

08:23.083 --> 08:25.583
I was just looking

08:23.083 --> 08:25.583
over some personnel files.

08:25.625 --> 08:27.583
Well, that's too bad.

08:27.625 --> 08:30.375
Thought you might

08:27.625 --> 08:30.375
be thinking about me.

08:30.417 --> 08:33.583
I thought you'd be deep

08:30.417 --> 08:33.583
in negotiations by now.

08:33.625 --> 08:35.208
In recess.

08:37.041 --> 08:39.333
I never play the opening

08:37.041 --> 08:39.333
rounds, anyway.

08:39.375 --> 08:42.250
Inconsequential.

08:42.291 --> 08:43.458
Besides, there are

08:42.291 --> 08:43.458
much better things

08:43.500 --> 08:46.709
to negotiate

08:43.500 --> 08:46.709
on this ship...

08:46.750 --> 08:49.000
like dinner tonight?

08:49.041 --> 08:51.750
What about your

08:49.041 --> 08:51.750
traveling companion?

08:52.959 --> 08:56.917
My traveling companion

08:52.959 --> 08:56.917
is... traveling.

08:58.125 --> 09:00.667
I sent her home.

09:00.709 --> 09:02.917
Why?

09:02.959 --> 09:04.959
You know why.

09:05.959 --> 09:09.125
Weren't you

09:05.959 --> 09:09.125
getting along?

09:09.166 --> 09:11.542
Don't do that.

09:09.166 --> 09:11.542
What?

09:11.583 --> 09:15.333
Don't do

09:11.583 --> 09:15.333

09:15.375 --> 09:18.041
Was I?

09:15.375 --> 09:18.041
Yes, you were.

09:24.417 --> 09:27.291
When you leave

09:24.417 --> 09:27.291
this office...

09:27.333 --> 09:29.291
who are you?

09:30.458 --> 09:33.834
Oh, so that's

09:30.458 --> 09:33.834
how it goes.

09:33.875 --> 09:37.375
You never do.

09:37.417 --> 09:39.083
You never do...

09:39.125 --> 09:43.458
leave...

09:39.125 --> 09:43.458
the office.

09:43.500 --> 09:46.125
What are--

09:43.500 --> 09:46.125
Shh-shh-shh.

10:00.959 --> 10:02.959
Dinner at 8:00?

10:20.709 --> 10:23.166
The readings from the Barzans'

10:20.709 --> 10:23.166
probe of the wormhole

10:23.208 --> 10:25.083
are quite impressive,

10:23.208 --> 10:25.083
Captain.

10:25.125 --> 10:27.291
The wormhole

10:25.125 --> 10:27.291
delivered the probe

10:27.333 --> 10:30.208
beyond the Denkiri Arm

10:27.333 --> 10:30.208
in the Gamma Quadrant.

10:30.250 --> 10:32.125
(<i> whistles</i> )

10:33.458 --> 10:35.250
It would take nearly

10:33.458 --> 10:35.250
a century at warp 9

10:35.291 --> 10:36.959
to cover

10:35.291 --> 10:36.959
that distance.

10:37.000 --> 10:39.166
The same distance could be

10:37.000 --> 10:39.166
achieved in a matter of seconds

10:39.208 --> 10:41.291
through the wormhole.

10:39.208 --> 10:41.291
Mm.

10:41.333 --> 10:44.500
Imagine the Ferengi, collecting

10:41.333 --> 10:44.500
tolls if we lose to them.

10:44.542 --> 10:46.125
I don't think

10:44.542 --> 10:46.125
the Ferengi are

10:46.166 --> 10:48.417
the greatest threat

10:46.166 --> 10:48.417
at the table.

10:48.458 --> 10:50.959
With all of

10:48.458 --> 10:50.959
DaiMon Goss's bluster,

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
they don't have the resources

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
the Barzans need.

10:53.041 --> 10:55.709
Mm-hmm. I think

10:53.041 --> 10:55.709
that Devinoni

10:55.750 --> 10:58.917
is the one that we need

10:55.750 --> 10:58.917
to watch out for.

10:58.959 --> 11:00.750
An accurate observation.

11:00.792 --> 11:02.375
How did you

11:00.792 --> 11:02.375
recognize that?

11:02.417 --> 11:04.417
Well he was the most

11:02.417 --> 11:04.417
comfortable one in the group.

11:04.458 --> 11:06.375
You must play poker,

11:04.458 --> 11:06.375
Commander.

11:06.417 --> 11:10.208
Poker? Is that a game

11:06.417 --> 11:10.208
of some sort?

11:10.250 --> 11:13.291
Commander Riker conducts

11:10.250 --> 11:13.291
master classes in poker.

11:14.542 --> 11:16.875
Our skills are

11:14.542 --> 11:16.875
not dissimilar, Commander.

11:16.917 --> 11:20.291
Mr. Mendoza, if this

11:16.917 --> 11:20.291
lives up to its billing,

11:20.333 --> 11:24.542
it will be a discovery

11:20.333 --> 11:24.542
of extraordinary value.

11:24.583 --> 11:26.750
But it is

11:24.583 --> 11:26.750
a very big "if."

11:26.792 --> 11:28.917
a wormhole is there one moment

11:26.792 --> 11:28.917
and then gone the next.

11:28.959 --> 11:31.041
A stable wormhole

11:28.959 --> 11:31.041
is unheard of.

11:31.083 --> 11:33.667
Are you saying this

11:31.083 --> 11:33.667
may not be what it seems?

11:33.709 --> 11:35.709
The Barzans do not have

11:33.709 --> 11:35.709
manned space travel,

11:35.750 --> 11:38.208
so they had to resort to

11:35.750 --> 11:38.208
an automated probe.

11:38.250 --> 11:39.792
Its findings are limited.

11:39.834 --> 11:41.792
It cannot be determined

11:39.834 --> 11:41.792
from these charts

11:41.834 --> 11:44.208
how stable

11:41.834 --> 11:44.208
the wormhole<i> really</i> is,

11:44.250 --> 11:46.250
or how long it will

11:44.250 --> 11:46.250
remain intact.

11:46.291 --> 11:47.834
The Federation

11:46.291 --> 11:47.834
could end up buying

11:47.875 --> 11:50.208
a proverbial lemon.

11:50.250 --> 11:51.750
"Proverbial lemon"?

11:51.792 --> 11:53.417
Later, data.

11:51.792 --> 11:53.417
Aye, sir.

11:53.458 --> 11:54.917
And of course,

11:53.458 --> 11:54.917
that means

11:54.959 --> 11:56.917
once the contract

11:54.959 --> 11:56.917
is negotiated and closed,

11:56.959 --> 11:59.583
we would be obliged

11:56.959 --> 11:59.583
to fulfill the terms.

11:59.625 --> 12:01.792
I think we should take a look

11:59.625 --> 12:01.792
for ourselves.

12:01.834 --> 12:03.709
I don't think Bhavani

12:01.834 --> 12:03.709
could object to that.

12:03.750 --> 12:05.792
Geordi has been in

12:03.750 --> 12:05.792
continuous visual contact

12:05.834 --> 12:07.041
with the wormhole,

12:05.834 --> 12:07.041
Captain.

12:07.083 --> 12:08.291
I think it's

12:07.083 --> 12:08.291
a logical choice.

12:08.333 --> 12:09.792
I would also like

12:08.333 --> 12:09.792
to volunteer, sir.

12:09.834 --> 12:11.417
Mm, nobody's going in there

12:09.834 --> 12:11.417
until we have done

12:11.458 --> 12:14.375
a full sensor

12:11.458 --> 12:14.375
analysis.

12:14.417 --> 12:15.875
I want to do everything possible

12:14.417 --> 12:15.875
to determine

12:15.917 --> 12:18.709
that it is safe,

12:15.917 --> 12:18.709
and when I am satisfied

12:18.750 --> 12:20.875
then you, Data,

12:18.750 --> 12:20.875
and Commander La Forge

12:20.917 --> 12:24.750
will enter the wormhole,

12:20.917 --> 12:24.750
tomorrow.

12:26.208 --> 12:30.625
Just a moment of discomfort

12:26.208 --> 12:30.625
for a good cause, DaiMon.

12:30.667 --> 12:34.125
You understand this

12:30.667 --> 12:34.125
will not be lethal?

12:34.166 --> 12:35.709
Doctor,

12:34.166 --> 12:35.709
you surprise me.

12:35.750 --> 12:37.834
I have no wish

12:35.750 --> 12:37.834
to kill anyone.

12:37.875 --> 12:40.458
A short-term crippling

12:37.875 --> 12:40.458
will suffice.

12:40.500 --> 12:43.709
Then, this will

12:40.500 --> 12:43.709
be just fine.

12:43.750 --> 12:47.417
A distillation of your

12:43.750 --> 12:47.417
own blood pyrocytes--

12:47.458 --> 12:51.750
harmless to you, undetectable

12:47.458 --> 12:51.750
by the ship's bio-filters,

12:51.792 --> 12:54.750
but when absorbed

12:51.792 --> 12:54.750
through your victim's skin

12:54.792 --> 12:58.750
it will provoke an extreme

12:54.792 --> 12:58.750
allergic reaction.

12:58.792 --> 13:01.500
I'd say it's time to extend

12:58.792 --> 13:01.500
the hand of the Ferengi

13:01.542 --> 13:04.125
to the representative

13:01.542 --> 13:04.125
of the Federation.

13:12.959 --> 13:15.000
Much better.

13:15.041 --> 13:17.500
Thank you.

13:17.542 --> 13:19.083
Come in for a drink?

13:23.083 --> 13:26.000
Ah, Federation decor.

13:26.041 --> 13:27.208
Not your style?

13:27.250 --> 13:31.166
Well, conformity

13:27.250 --> 13:31.166
is not my style.

13:32.667 --> 13:34.709
What would you like?

13:42.166 --> 13:44.208
I'd even like another.

13:49.458 --> 13:50.917
Well, there she is again.

13:50.959 --> 13:53.583
Counselor Troi.

13:50.959 --> 13:53.583
I'm not.

13:55.125 --> 13:57.959
Computer, champagne.

13:58.000 --> 13:59.333
For two.

14:09.875 --> 14:12.083
Am I moving

14:09.875 --> 14:12.083
too fast for you?

14:14.041 --> 14:18.208
No, I'm moving

14:14.041 --> 14:18.208
too fast for me.

14:19.291 --> 14:21.333
I like that better.

14:27.041 --> 14:30.792
I haven't been able to stop

14:27.041 --> 14:30.792
thinking about you all day.

14:48.667 --> 14:51.417
You must have had

14:48.667 --> 14:51.417
a nice day.

14:51.458 --> 14:53.834
Anticipation is fun.

15:02.083 --> 15:04.083
We'll be late

15:02.083 --> 15:04.083
for dinner.

15:09.166 --> 15:11.166
Very late.

15:25.542 --> 15:26.792
Mr. Mendoza?

15:26.834 --> 15:29.208
I seem to be

15:26.834 --> 15:29.208
a bit warm.

15:30.667 --> 15:32.667
I need some help here.

15:34.542 --> 15:38.041
You attempt to gain

15:34.542 --> 15:38.041
every unfair advantage, Picard.

15:38.083 --> 15:39.750
Premier Bhavani

15:38.083 --> 15:39.750
has no objection.

15:39.792 --> 15:41.625
Well, I most

15:39.792 --> 15:41.625
certainly do.

15:41.667 --> 15:44.709
First, you conveniently

15:41.667 --> 15:44.709
arrange to play host,

15:44.750 --> 15:46.875
then you plan to send

15:44.750 --> 15:46.875
a manned probe

15:46.917 --> 15:49.667
into the wormhole.

15:46.917 --> 15:49.667
The Federation thinks

15:49.709 --> 15:51.291
it can do anything

15:49.709 --> 15:51.291
it wants to.

15:51.333 --> 15:52.959
Well I will not

15:51.333 --> 15:52.959
tolerate it!

15:53.000 --> 15:54.709
I will gladly share

15:53.000 --> 15:54.709
the results

15:54.750 --> 15:57.333
of our explorations

15:54.750 --> 15:57.333
with all the delegates.

15:59.125 --> 16:02.542
And you expect us to believe

15:59.125 --> 16:02.542
what you report?

16:02.583 --> 16:04.583
Then send in

16:02.583 --> 16:04.583
your own probe, Goss.

16:04.625 --> 16:06.583
That's exactly

16:04.625 --> 16:06.583
what I intend to do.

16:06.625 --> 16:09.750
And I should strongly suggest

16:06.625 --> 16:09.750
that<i> you</i> stay out of our way!

16:17.333 --> 16:19.750
Tell Data and La Forge

16:17.333 --> 16:19.750
to do themselves a favor

16:19.792 --> 16:21.417
and stay

16:19.792 --> 16:21.417
out of their way.

16:25.375 --> 16:27.959
CRUSHER:

16:25.375 --> 16:27.959
Captain Picard,

16:25.375 --> 16:27.959
please come to sick bay.

16:28.000 --> 16:29.834
Acknowledged, Doctor.

16:32.959 --> 16:34.208
CRUSHER:

16:32.959 --> 16:34.208
Whatever he's got

16:34.250 --> 16:36.333
is obviously not

16:34.250 --> 16:36.333
life-threatening.

16:36.375 --> 16:40.166
It's some kind of system-wide

16:36.375 --> 16:40.166
histaminic reaction.

16:40.208 --> 16:41.417
He certainly

16:40.208 --> 16:41.417
can't go back

16:41.458 --> 16:43.542
to negotiations

16:41.458 --> 16:43.542
for several days.

16:44.917 --> 16:46.333
Will you keep me

16:44.917 --> 16:46.333
informed?

16:46.375 --> 16:48.125
Mm.

16:54.542 --> 16:56.417
The Federation's

16:54.542 --> 16:56.417
top negotiator

16:56.458 --> 16:59.542
taken out by

16:56.458 --> 16:59.542
a mysterious ailment.

16:59.583 --> 17:00.875
Suspicion?

17:00.917 --> 17:03.583
With the Ferengi around?

17:00.917 --> 17:03.583
Always.

17:03.625 --> 17:06.375
You'll have to fill in,

17:03.625 --> 17:06.375
Number One.

17:03.625 --> 17:06.375
Me?

17:06.417 --> 17:08.041
Well I am

17:06.417 --> 17:08.041
the designated host.

17:08.083 --> 17:10.959
It would be a most

17:08.083 --> 17:10.959
awkward transition.

17:11.000 --> 17:13.250
You're the next

17:11.000 --> 17:13.250
likely choice.

17:13.291 --> 17:15.834
And Mr. Mendoza

17:13.291 --> 17:15.834
will certainly agree.

17:15.875 --> 17:18.375
He's quite impressed

17:15.875 --> 17:18.375
by your natural instincts.

17:18.417 --> 17:20.333
Excuse me sir, but those

17:18.417 --> 17:20.333
weren't natural instincts,

17:20.375 --> 17:22.250
those were

17:20.375 --> 17:22.250
poker instincts.

17:22.291 --> 17:24.709
A card game doesn't exactly

17:22.291 --> 17:24.709
prepare me for this.

17:24.750 --> 17:26.709
Yes, the stakes

17:24.750 --> 17:26.709
are higher.

17:26.750 --> 17:27.959
But then,

17:26.750 --> 17:27.959
isn't that when

17:28.000 --> 17:30.333
the game gets interesting,

17:28.000 --> 17:30.333
Commander?

17:36.542 --> 17:38.458
The wormhole will reappear

17:36.542 --> 17:38.458
in 30 seconds, sir.

17:38.500 --> 17:40.875
WORF:

17:38.500 --> 17:40.875
The Ferengi pod

17:38.500 --> 17:40.875
is moving into position.

17:40.917 --> 17:43.041
Shuttle nine,

17:40.917 --> 17:43.041
stand by.

17:47.917 --> 17:50.542
Ferengi pod, this is

17:47.917 --> 17:50.542
Lieutenant Commander La Forge

17:50.583 --> 17:52.458
in the<i> Enterprise</i>

17:50.583 --> 17:52.458
shuttle.

17:52.500 --> 17:55.041
This is Dr. Arridor.

17:52.500 --> 17:55.041
Go ahead.

17:55.083 --> 17:57.959
Would you care to take

17:55.083 --> 17:57.959
the point, Doctor?

17:58.000 --> 18:00.750
We will gladly yield

17:58.000 --> 18:00.750
that honor to<i> you,</i>

18:00.792 --> 18:02.542
Lieutenant Commander.

18:05.166 --> 18:06.875
You know,

18:05.166 --> 18:06.875
if this doesn't work,

18:06.917 --> 18:08.667
the thought of spending

18:06.917 --> 18:08.667
the rest of my life in here

18:08.709 --> 18:11.583
is none too appealing.

18:11.625 --> 18:13.834
There is a bright side,

18:11.625 --> 18:13.834
Geordi.

18:13.875 --> 18:17.375
You will have<i> me</i>

18:13.875 --> 18:17.375
to talk to.

18:21.417 --> 18:23.750
DATA:

18:21.417 --> 18:23.750
It is visible, Captain.

18:23.792 --> 18:25.500
Proceed when ready.

18:33.250 --> 18:35.625
DATA:

18:33.250 --> 18:35.625
...and intense energy fields

18:35.667 --> 18:40.291
(<i> audio distorting</i> )

18:35.667 --> 18:40.291
which appear to be stable--

18:40.333 --> 18:43.417
They've traveled beyond our

18:40.333 --> 18:43.417
communication capability, sir.

18:43.458 --> 18:45.750
A complete analysis

18:43.458 --> 18:45.750
of our bid is available

18:45.792 --> 18:48.375
on the ship's computer

18:45.792 --> 18:48.375
for your consideration.

18:48.417 --> 18:50.959
Commander, I realize

18:48.417 --> 18:50.959
what a difficult position

18:51.000 --> 18:52.583
this must be for you.

18:52.625 --> 18:54.542
If you don't

18:52.625 --> 18:54.542
understand something,

18:54.583 --> 18:57.625
I hope you won't be

18:54.583 --> 18:57.625
too embarrassed to ask me.

18:57.667 --> 19:00.291
I think I have an idea

18:57.667 --> 19:00.291
what the rules are.

19:00.333 --> 19:02.875
Well, that's what makes it

19:00.333 --> 19:02.875
so interesting.

19:02.917 --> 19:05.417
The rules of the game change

19:02.917 --> 19:05.417
to fit the moment.

19:05.458 --> 19:09.375
Not unlike commanding

19:05.458 --> 19:09.375
a starship, Mr. Ral.

19:09.417 --> 19:10.917
Well, Mr. Riker's

19:09.417 --> 19:10.917
placed a--

19:10.959 --> 19:13.917
a great deal

19:10.959 --> 19:13.917
of emphasis on defense,

19:13.959 --> 19:16.333
a subject he obviously

19:13.959 --> 19:16.333
knows well

19:16.375 --> 19:20.125
having served Starfleet

19:16.375 --> 19:20.125
in a number of conflicts.

19:20.166 --> 19:22.959
Now, the Chrysalians?

19:23.000 --> 19:24.917
We're enemies

19:23.000 --> 19:24.917
to no one...

19:24.959 --> 19:27.417
and we choose

19:24.959 --> 19:27.417
to remain that way.

19:27.458 --> 19:29.333
Neutral.

19:30.875 --> 19:34.125
Neutral, and uninvolved,

19:30.875 --> 19:34.125
sir...

19:34.166 --> 19:37.500
in virtually all interstellar

19:34.166 --> 19:37.500
matters of consequence.

19:38.750 --> 19:40.208
No one would claim that

19:38.750 --> 19:40.208
the Chrysalians

19:40.250 --> 19:43.917
are as powerful as

19:40.250 --> 19:43.917
the mighty Federation.

19:43.959 --> 19:45.667
But, we have resources,

19:45.709 --> 19:49.750
and technology,

19:45.709 --> 19:49.750
and scientists, too.

19:49.792 --> 19:53.125
But we also have had peace

19:49.792 --> 19:53.125
for ten generations.

19:59.792 --> 20:01.750
RAL:

19:59.792 --> 20:01.750
You know,

19:59.792 --> 20:01.750
I was thinking...

20:01.792 --> 20:03.458
TROI:

20:01.792 --> 20:03.458
Mmm?

20:03.500 --> 20:05.875
RAL:

20:03.500 --> 20:05.875
Maybe I could stretch out

20:03.500 --> 20:05.875
these negotiations

20:05.917 --> 20:08.500
for a few days.

20:08.542 --> 20:10.083
Would you like that?

20:10.125 --> 20:12.792
TROI:

20:10.125 --> 20:12.792
Mm-hmm.

20:16.333 --> 20:19.333
Devinoni Ral...

20:19.375 --> 20:21.834
who<i> are</i> you?

20:21.875 --> 20:26.250
Well what do your Betazoid

20:21.875 --> 20:26.250
senses tell you about me?

20:26.291 --> 20:29.333
Not much.

20:29.375 --> 20:33.917
My human physical response

20:29.375 --> 20:33.917
must be blocking them out.

20:34.917 --> 20:36.667
Good.

20:37.875 --> 20:40.166
It never happened

20:37.875 --> 20:40.166
to me before.

20:42.792 --> 20:45.667
I rather like that

20:42.792 --> 20:45.667
I'm more difficult to read

20:45.709 --> 20:47.917
than your other men.

20:47.959 --> 20:51.375
There aren't any others...

20:51.417 --> 20:53.500
currently.

20:53.542 --> 20:55.458
What about Commander Riker?

21:02.959 --> 21:04.166
Who have you been

21:02.959 --> 21:04.166
talking to?

21:04.208 --> 21:05.417
No one.

21:05.458 --> 21:07.333
No one, I just

21:05.458 --> 21:07.333
sensed something

21:07.375 --> 21:10.542
when I saw the two

21:07.375 --> 21:10.542
of you together.

21:10.583 --> 21:14.041
Will Riker and I

21:10.583 --> 21:14.041
are good friends.

21:14.083 --> 21:16.208
Uh-huh.

21:24.417 --> 21:27.166
It was once a little more

21:24.417 --> 21:27.166
than that.

21:27.208 --> 21:29.208
Ah.

21:32.542 --> 21:36.583
How come we're talking

21:32.542 --> 21:36.583
about me instead of you?

21:36.625 --> 21:39.291
Haven't you had enough people

21:36.625 --> 21:39.291
talk about their lives to you?

21:40.875 --> 21:42.709
Who counsels

21:40.875 --> 21:42.709
the Counselor?

21:42.750 --> 21:44.792
Oh, no.

21:44.834 --> 21:47.250
I want to know about you.

21:47.291 --> 21:49.917
I'm what you see

21:47.291 --> 21:49.917
right now.

21:49.959 --> 21:55.250
Just me... wanting to run

21:49.959 --> 21:55.250
away with you,

21:55.291 --> 21:57.417
but knowing you'd never leave

21:55.291 --> 21:57.417
this damned ship.

21:59.375 --> 22:03.583
When I first saw you,

22:03.625 --> 22:06.291
I felt as if

22:03.625 --> 22:06.291
I'd been waiting for you.

22:08.417 --> 22:11.041
I'm trying to understand

22:11.083 --> 22:14.625
why or how that's possible.

22:14.667 --> 22:16.000
Does it matter?

22:20.834 --> 22:24.458
Well, it will,

22:20.834 --> 22:24.458
when I tell you.

22:24.500 --> 22:26.750
But you must promise never to

22:24.500 --> 22:26.750
tell anyone else.

22:28.792 --> 22:30.458
What?

22:32.709 --> 22:35.959
I am part Betazoid, too.

22:36.041 --> 22:39.917
My mother was one-half.

22:36.041 --> 22:39.917
I am one-quarter.

22:39.959 --> 22:41.959
You're empathic?

22:42.000 --> 22:45.208
The only one

22:42.000 --> 22:45.208
of five children.

22:45.250 --> 22:47.875
I must admit, I was--

22:47.917 --> 22:49.959
I was never as comfortable

22:47.917 --> 22:49.959
sensing emotions

22:50.000 --> 22:52.458
as you seem to be.

22:52.500 --> 22:55.458
So that's why

22:52.500 --> 22:55.458
you left Earth?

22:55.500 --> 22:57.709
Yes.

22:57.750 --> 23:02.917
I've learned to live with it,

22:57.750 --> 23:02.917
use it, as you have.

23:02.959 --> 23:06.208
But, still...

23:06.250 --> 23:09.500
it isolates us,

23:06.250 --> 23:09.500
doesn't it?

23:09.542 --> 23:11.458
And I thought

23:09.542 --> 23:11.458
it always would,

23:11.500 --> 23:13.333
so I tucked

23:11.500 --> 23:13.333
my heart away.

23:13.375 --> 23:15.875
I didn't need it.

23:13.375 --> 23:15.875
I didn't want it.

23:18.375 --> 23:22.000
At the negotiating table,

23:22.041 --> 23:24.250
it can be fatal

23:22.041 --> 23:24.250
to have a heart.

23:27.333 --> 23:32.083
But I never realized

23:27.333 --> 23:32.083
how much I needed mine...

23:32.125 --> 23:34.291
until I looked at you.

23:49.208 --> 23:51.625
I'm picking up an increase

23:49.208 --> 23:51.625
in accretion matter

23:51.667 --> 23:53.333
filtering in

23:51.667 --> 23:53.333
from the terminus.

24:01.166 --> 24:03.458
Monitors are functioning

24:01.166 --> 24:03.458
normally again.

24:03.500 --> 24:05.542
Ferengi pod...

24:05.583 --> 24:07.083
everybody in one piece

24:05.583 --> 24:07.083
over there?

24:07.125 --> 24:08.625
ARRIDOR:

24:07.125 --> 24:08.625
Our condition

24:08.667 --> 24:11.542
is no concern of yours,

24:08.667 --> 24:11.542
<i>Enterprise</i> shuttle .

24:11.583 --> 24:14.875
We are competitors in this

24:11.583 --> 24:14.875
venture, not partners.

24:14.917 --> 24:17.333
Ferengi pod, out.

24:17.375 --> 24:20.208
Yeah, happy landings

24:17.375 --> 24:20.208
to you, too.

24:20.250 --> 24:22.500
Curious.

24:20.250 --> 24:22.500
Hmm?

24:22.542 --> 24:25.792
We are not where

24:22.542 --> 24:25.792
we are supposed to be.

24:25.834 --> 24:27.166
What do you mean?

24:25.834 --> 24:27.166
We're on the other side

24:27.208 --> 24:28.750
of the wormhole,

24:27.208 --> 24:28.750
aren't we?

24:28.792 --> 24:30.208
According to

24:28.792 --> 24:30.208
the Barzan probe,

24:30.250 --> 24:32.208
we should be in

24:30.250 --> 24:32.208
the Gamma Quadrant.

24:32.250 --> 24:34.000
But these readings

24:32.250 --> 24:34.000
clearly indicate

24:34.041 --> 24:35.792
we are nearly 200

24:34.041 --> 24:35.792
light years away

24:35.834 --> 24:38.083
in sector 3556

24:38.125 --> 24:40.250
of the Delta Quadrant.

24:40.291 --> 24:42.375
Maybe the Barzan readings

24:40.291 --> 24:42.375
were wrong.

24:43.542 --> 24:45.959
Perhaps their readings

24:43.542 --> 24:45.959
were correct.

24:46.000 --> 24:48.083
Their probe could have

24:46.000 --> 24:48.083
exited the wormhole

24:48.125 --> 24:50.250
at a completely different

24:48.125 --> 24:50.250
location.

24:50.291 --> 24:53.250
Hmm, Data,

24:50.291 --> 24:53.250
my visor's

24:53.291 --> 24:56.083
picking up subatomic

24:53.291 --> 24:56.083
fluctuations.

24:56.125 --> 24:58.792
Meson and lepton activity

24:56.125 --> 24:58.792
is definitely increasing.

24:58.834 --> 25:01.625
Gravitational acceleration

24:58.834 --> 25:01.625
is also increasing.

25:03.250 --> 25:07.500
Something<i> very</i> strange

25:03.250 --> 25:07.500
is happening to this wormhole.

25:19.208 --> 25:21.208
Sorry.

25:26.583 --> 25:28.792
You're unusually limber

25:26.583 --> 25:28.792
this morning.

25:28.834 --> 25:31.792
I'll say.

25:31.834 --> 25:33.917
Devinoni Ral.

25:35.875 --> 25:39.667
It's ridiculous

25:35.875 --> 25:39.667
and wonderful.

25:39.709 --> 25:42.709
I feel completely

25:39.709 --> 25:42.709
out of control.

25:42.750 --> 25:45.166
Happy, terrified.

25:46.667 --> 25:49.041
But there's nothing

25:46.667 --> 25:49.041
rational about this.

25:49.083 --> 25:51.750
Who needs rational

25:49.083 --> 25:51.750
when your toes curl up?

25:57.875 --> 26:01.041
I'm afraid

25:57.875 --> 26:01.041
I'm going to lose myself.

26:02.500 --> 26:05.041
I can't get enough

26:02.500 --> 26:05.041
of him.

26:05.083 --> 26:07.500
Is it possible to fall

26:05.083 --> 26:07.500
in love in one day?

26:07.542 --> 26:09.417
I did.

26:09.458 --> 26:11.000
It was like this

26:09.458 --> 26:11.000
for you and Jack?

26:11.041 --> 26:14.208
No, it was

26:11.041 --> 26:14.208
another fellow.

26:14.250 --> 26:16.041
I fell in love

26:14.250 --> 26:16.041
in a day.

26:16.083 --> 26:19.250
It lasted a week,

26:16.083 --> 26:19.250
but what a week.

26:22.750 --> 26:24.333
Then I met Jack.

26:24.375 --> 26:27.041
Oh, it took months

26:24.375 --> 26:27.041
to figure it out with him.

26:27.083 --> 26:30.166
Well, then maybe

26:27.083 --> 26:30.166
I should slow down.

26:30.208 --> 26:32.375
Catch my breath.

26:32.417 --> 26:36.542
Not let this thing get out of

26:32.417 --> 26:36.542
control.

26:36.583 --> 26:39.583
BOTH:

26:36.583 --> 26:39.583
Nah.

26:39.625 --> 26:42.959
(<i> indistinct conversation</i> )

26:53.709 --> 26:55.625
To be honest,

26:53.709 --> 26:55.625
I was surprised

26:55.667 --> 26:59.250
to see the Caldonians

26:55.667 --> 26:59.250
here at all, Leyor.

26:59.291 --> 27:02.417
You must think Caldonia

26:59.291 --> 27:02.417
very insular, Mr. Ral.

27:02.458 --> 27:04.250
Oh no, no, not at all.

27:02.458 --> 27:04.250
Not at all.

27:04.291 --> 27:07.166
On the contrary,

27:04.291 --> 27:07.166
I've always respected

27:07.208 --> 27:10.667
your world's commitment

27:07.208 --> 27:10.667
to pure research.

27:10.709 --> 27:11.959
It's just that...

27:12.000 --> 27:13.792
well...

27:13.834 --> 27:16.625
Go on, please.

27:16.667 --> 27:21.417
Well, scholars don't always

27:16.667 --> 27:21.417
enjoy administrative demands.

27:21.458 --> 27:22.875
And certainly

27:21.458 --> 27:22.875
we've seen here

27:22.917 --> 27:24.125
that the administration

27:24.166 --> 27:27.917
of the wormhole is--

27:24.166 --> 27:27.917
Yes, I must admit,

27:27.959 --> 27:31.417
I have begun to feel

27:27.959 --> 27:31.417
some trepidation about that.

27:33.083 --> 27:34.959
Yes.

27:35.000 --> 27:38.417
Yes, I'm sure

27:35.000 --> 27:38.417
you have, Leyor.

27:38.458 --> 27:40.500
I'm sure we all have.

27:40.542 --> 27:43.250
Do you realize that

27:40.542 --> 27:43.250
in the next century,

27:43.291 --> 27:44.917
the number of ships

27:43.291 --> 27:44.917
that will pass...

27:44.959 --> 27:47.333
Gentlemen, this open session

27:44.959 --> 27:47.333
is called by request

27:47.375 --> 27:49.667
of the Caldonia

27:47.375 --> 27:49.667
delegation.

27:51.709 --> 27:53.041
Madame Bhavani,

27:53.083 --> 27:56.417
Caldonia withdraws

27:53.083 --> 27:56.417
from these proceedings.

27:56.458 --> 27:58.583
For what reasons,

27:56.458 --> 27:58.583
Leyor?

27:58.625 --> 28:00.917
It has been made very clear

27:58.625 --> 28:00.917
that the maintenance

28:00.959 --> 28:02.291
and administrative requirements

28:02.333 --> 28:04.709
are beyond our abilities.

28:04.750 --> 28:06.583
Leyor, the Federation

28:04.750 --> 28:06.583
would like

28:06.625 --> 28:08.250
to negotiate

28:06.625 --> 28:08.250
a trade agreement

28:08.291 --> 28:10.875
in which we could acquire

28:08.291 --> 28:10.875
your planet's rich deposits

28:10.917 --> 28:14.166
of Trillium 323,

28:10.917 --> 28:14.166
which we would add to our bid,

28:14.208 --> 28:15.709
Premier Bhavani.

28:15.750 --> 28:17.125
My apologies.

28:17.166 --> 28:18.709
We have already reached

28:17.166 --> 28:18.709
an agreement

28:18.750 --> 28:20.083
with the Chrysalians.

28:26.458 --> 28:28.166
Mr. Ral...

28:28.208 --> 28:30.166
you either had

28:28.208 --> 28:30.166
very good instincts

28:30.208 --> 28:33.917
or a foreknowledge

28:30.208 --> 28:33.917
of the Caldonian withdrawal.

28:33.959 --> 28:36.166
Well, some people just don't

28:33.959 --> 28:36.166
like to transact business

28:36.208 --> 28:38.583
with the Federation,

28:36.208 --> 28:38.583
Commander.

28:38.625 --> 28:40.625
The Chrysalians

28:38.625 --> 28:40.625
hereby add

28:40.667 --> 28:45.667
the Caldonian Trillium 323

28:40.667 --> 28:45.667
to its bid, Premier.

28:55.000 --> 28:56.917
I'm telling you,

28:55.000 --> 28:56.917
it's changing.

28:56.959 --> 28:58.625
I can see it

28:56.959 --> 28:58.625
with my visor.

28:58.667 --> 29:00.792
I have no intention

28:58.667 --> 29:00.792
of leaving yet.

29:00.834 --> 29:02.792
We have not finished taking

29:00.834 --> 29:02.792
our readings.

29:02.834 --> 29:03.959
Listen, Doctor,

29:04.000 --> 29:05.208
your readings must

29:04.000 --> 29:05.208
be telling you

29:05.250 --> 29:06.500
the same things

29:05.250 --> 29:06.500
we're getting.

29:06.542 --> 29:08.667
This is not

29:06.542 --> 29:08.667
the Gamma Quadrant.

29:08.709 --> 29:11.500
I will not confirm

29:08.709 --> 29:11.500
your speculations.

29:11.542 --> 29:13.709
This is not

29:11.542 --> 29:13.709
a speculation, Doctor.

29:13.750 --> 29:15.875
We are not where the Barzans

29:13.750 --> 29:15.875
said we should be,

29:15.917 --> 29:19.041
which would indicate this side

29:15.917 --> 29:19.041
of the wormhole is not stable.

29:19.083 --> 29:21.917
There are meson

29:19.083 --> 29:21.917
and lepton fluctuations.

29:21.959 --> 29:24.583
Local gravitational fields

29:21.959 --> 29:24.583
are increasing exponentially.

29:24.625 --> 29:26.709
Everything says we better get

29:24.625 --> 29:26.709
the hell out of here.

29:26.750 --> 29:29.583
It will be visible again

29:26.750 --> 29:29.583
in 40 seconds.

29:29.625 --> 29:31.458
We will make

29:29.625 --> 29:31.458
our own judgments then.

29:31.500 --> 29:33.125
I can see it now

29:31.500 --> 29:33.125
and I'm telling you,

29:33.166 --> 29:36.250
you don't have time to wait,

29:33.166 --> 29:36.250
not even 40 seconds.

29:36.291 --> 29:37.750
Ferengi pod, out.

29:37.792 --> 29:39.250
Damn it, Arridor!

29:39.291 --> 29:41.041
We're 70,000

29:39.291 --> 29:41.041
light years

29:41.083 --> 29:43.000
away from our ships.

29:41.083 --> 29:43.000
Come on now!

29:43.041 --> 29:45.750
Follow us in.

29:43.041 --> 29:45.750
We'll lead you.

29:49.000 --> 29:51.000
Idiots.

29:53.000 --> 29:55.375
It's getting worse.

29:55.417 --> 29:58.917
I'm taking us in, Data,

29:55.417 --> 29:58.917
with or without them.

29:58.959 --> 30:00.709
Thrusters at half power...

30:00.750 --> 30:01.959
three-quarters...

30:02.000 --> 30:04.750
Entering outer

30:02.000 --> 30:04.750
event horizon.

30:10.583 --> 30:13.667
They panic quickly

30:10.583 --> 30:13.667
under pressure.

30:15.792 --> 30:17.000
There...

30:17.041 --> 30:18.458
precisely as scheduled,

30:18.500 --> 30:20.875
right where

30:18.500 --> 30:20.875
I expected it to be.

30:31.875 --> 30:33.291
Everyone was talking today

30:33.333 --> 30:37.333
about the way you absorbed

30:33.333 --> 30:37.333
the Caldonian bid.

30:37.375 --> 30:38.917
Well, the opening

30:37.375 --> 30:38.917
was there.

30:38.959 --> 30:40.625
I took it.

30:40.667 --> 30:43.333
Commander Riker didn't know

30:40.667 --> 30:43.333
how you managed it.

30:44.750 --> 30:47.792
Let me tell you something

30:44.750 --> 30:47.792
about Commander Riker.

30:47.834 --> 30:49.291
He's good.

30:49.333 --> 30:51.792
He's the most dangerous man

30:49.333 --> 30:51.792
in that room to me.

30:51.834 --> 30:55.375
But, he doesn't have

30:51.834 --> 30:55.375
an edge...

30:55.417 --> 30:56.667
your edge.

30:56.709 --> 30:59.834
<i>Our</i> edge.

30:59.875 --> 31:02.750
You make it sound

30:59.875 --> 31:02.750
unethical.

31:02.792 --> 31:05.250
Isn't it?

31:05.291 --> 31:08.792
Deanna...

31:05.291 --> 31:08.792
it's just business.

31:14.083 --> 31:16.875
Why haven't you told anyone

31:14.083 --> 31:16.875
you're an empath?

31:18.250 --> 31:20.709
Because I find it makes

31:18.250 --> 31:20.709
people uncomfortable.

31:22.667 --> 31:26.500
I think you don't tell them

31:22.667 --> 31:26.500
so you can gain an advantage.

31:28.125 --> 31:31.625
Well I gained an advantage

31:28.125 --> 31:31.625
by using it with you.

31:31.667 --> 31:33.834
You didn't seem

31:31.667 --> 31:33.834
to mind that.

31:39.375 --> 31:42.583
Look, Deanna...

31:42.625 --> 31:46.333
the point of negotiating

31:42.625 --> 31:46.333
is to take advantage.

31:46.375 --> 31:48.250
I don't know what the other side

31:46.375 --> 31:48.250
is offering,

31:48.291 --> 31:50.542
and they don't know

31:48.291 --> 31:50.542
what I'm offering.

31:50.583 --> 31:53.750
So we dance around each other

31:50.583 --> 31:53.750
until somebody wins.

31:53.792 --> 31:56.959
I never cry foul

31:53.792 --> 31:56.959
when I lose.

31:57.000 --> 32:00.041
But you're reading

31:57.000 --> 32:00.041
their emotional states,

32:00.083 --> 32:01.417
their inner selves,

32:01.458 --> 32:03.542
and then using that

32:01.458 --> 32:03.542
to manipulate them.

32:03.583 --> 32:06.667
Well people have done that

32:03.583 --> 32:06.667
for thousands of years,

32:06.709 --> 32:08.792
just by listening

32:06.709 --> 32:08.792
carefully,

32:08.834 --> 32:11.000
by watching

32:08.834 --> 32:11.000
body language.

32:11.041 --> 32:13.333
I just happen

32:11.041 --> 32:13.333
to be better at it.

32:13.375 --> 32:15.166
You do it.

32:15.208 --> 32:18.959
I do it to help my crew,

32:15.208 --> 32:18.959
not outmaneuver them.

32:20.291 --> 32:22.417
And I don't hide

32:20.291 --> 32:22.417
that I'm an empath.

32:22.458 --> 32:23.750
Oh, so you

32:22.458 --> 32:23.750
announce it

32:23.792 --> 32:27.083
to every alien culture

32:23.792 --> 32:27.083
you encounter?

32:27.125 --> 32:31.500
Or do you use it to give

32:27.125 --> 32:31.500
your side an advantage?

32:31.542 --> 32:33.542
Do you tell the Romulan

32:31.542 --> 32:33.542
that's about to attack

32:33.583 --> 32:36.166
that you sense that

32:33.583 --> 32:36.166
he may be bluffing?

32:36.208 --> 32:38.250
Or do you just tell it

32:36.208 --> 32:38.250
to your captain?

32:44.083 --> 32:46.417
That's different.

32:46.458 --> 32:48.417
That's a matter

32:46.458 --> 32:48.417
of protection.

32:48.458 --> 32:51.875
Yes, protection.

32:48.458 --> 32:51.875
Your protection,

32:51.917 --> 32:57.250
your captain,

32:51.917 --> 32:57.250
your crew, your edge.

32:57.291 --> 32:59.250
Yes.

33:00.500 --> 33:01.709
Now, it's a matter

33:00.500 --> 33:01.709
of life and death

33:01.750 --> 33:03.000
when you take

33:01.750 --> 33:03.000
the advantage.

33:03.041 --> 33:08.375
Me, I deal in property,

33:03.041 --> 33:08.375
exchanges.

33:08.417 --> 33:11.208
Nobody gets hurt.

33:11.250 --> 33:13.166
So you tell me...

33:13.208 --> 33:14.458
which one of us

33:13.208 --> 33:14.458
would you say

33:14.500 --> 33:17.333
has more of a problem

33:14.500 --> 33:17.333
with ethics?

33:19.583 --> 33:21.041
Excuse me.

33:48.667 --> 33:50.834
May I join you,

33:48.667 --> 33:50.834
Commander?

33:53.291 --> 33:55.250
Bought out

33:53.291 --> 33:55.250
the Ferengi yet, Ral?

33:55.291 --> 33:56.792
Think I should

33:55.291 --> 33:56.792
give it a try?

33:56.834 --> 33:58.583
No, but I think that you will.

33:56.834 --> 33:58.583
One way or another,

33:58.625 --> 34:01.041
it's gonna come down

33:58.625 --> 34:01.041
to you and me.

34:01.083 --> 34:02.583
You know, you're very

34:01.083 --> 34:02.583
good at this.

34:02.625 --> 34:03.750
Very good.

34:03.792 --> 34:05.166
Much better

34:03.792 --> 34:05.166
than you realize.

34:05.208 --> 34:07.333
Well, I hope I'm better

34:05.208 --> 34:07.333
than<i> you</i> realize.

34:07.375 --> 34:08.917
The last mile

34:07.375 --> 34:08.917
of the marathon

34:08.959 --> 34:10.667
is always

34:08.959 --> 34:10.667
the toughest.

34:10.709 --> 34:12.250
That's when the winners

34:10.709 --> 34:12.250
are willing

34:12.291 --> 34:14.250
to take the big risks.

34:15.166 --> 34:16.417
You willing

34:15.166 --> 34:16.417
to do that?

34:16.458 --> 34:17.667
We'll see, won't we?

34:17.709 --> 34:19.083
Well, let's see now.

34:19.125 --> 34:21.583
I'm prepared to reach a firm

34:19.125 --> 34:21.583
agreement with Bhavani

34:21.625 --> 34:24.875
before we learn the outcome

34:21.625 --> 34:24.875
of your probe's expedition.

34:24.917 --> 34:27.417
Are you?

34:27.458 --> 34:29.208
Oh, well, well, well.

34:29.250 --> 34:31.000
That would not be

34:29.250 --> 34:31.000
looked upon favorably

34:31.041 --> 34:33.291
by the Federation,

34:31.041 --> 34:33.291
I'd imagine.

34:33.333 --> 34:34.500
You see, you have to

34:33.333 --> 34:34.500
be willing

34:34.542 --> 34:37.834
to take that

34:34.542 --> 34:37.834
last step<i> alone,</i>

34:37.875 --> 34:39.625
or it just isn't

34:37.875 --> 34:39.625
worth playing.

34:39.667 --> 34:41.041
Your point of view,

34:39.667 --> 34:41.041
not mine.

34:41.083 --> 34:43.583
Oh, I see that,

34:41.083 --> 34:43.583
Commander, I see that.

34:43.625 --> 34:47.166
Otherwise, you wouldn't be

34:43.625 --> 34:47.166
<i>second</i> in command

34:47.208 --> 34:49.417
of this starship.

34:49.458 --> 34:50.875
You know, I feel

34:50.917 --> 34:54.458
responsible for you

34:50.917 --> 34:54.458
in a way... related.

34:56.375 --> 34:59.041
Deanna.

34:59.083 --> 35:01.583
We both love Deanna.

35:01.625 --> 35:03.917
Oh, in different ways,

35:01.625 --> 35:03.917
of course.

35:03.959 --> 35:08.000
I will remove that burden

35:03.959 --> 35:08.000
of responsibility right now.

35:08.041 --> 35:10.583
My relationship with Deanna

35:08.041 --> 35:10.583
stands very well on its own

35:10.625 --> 35:11.834
without any help

35:10.625 --> 35:11.834
from you.

35:11.875 --> 35:13.417
Of course it does,

35:11.875 --> 35:13.417
of course it does.

35:13.458 --> 35:17.000
It's just that,

35:13.458 --> 35:17.000
well...

35:17.041 --> 35:19.583
she's a remarkable woman.

35:19.625 --> 35:22.542
Brilliant, lovely...

35:24.333 --> 35:26.458
very passionate.

35:26.500 --> 35:28.709
And she could have

35:26.500 --> 35:28.709
been yours, Will.

35:28.750 --> 35:32.375
But you just didn't do enough

35:28.750 --> 35:32.375
to keep her.

35:32.417 --> 35:35.375
And now, well...

35:35.417 --> 35:38.083
I'm here.

35:38.125 --> 35:40.208
And I'm going

35:38.125 --> 35:40.208
to take her, too.

35:44.417 --> 35:47.125
That's the first bad play

35:44.417 --> 35:47.125
I've seen you make.

35:47.166 --> 35:50.125
If you can bring happiness

35:47.166 --> 35:50.125
into Deanna's life,

35:50.166 --> 35:53.083
nothing would

35:50.166 --> 35:53.083
please me more.

35:53.125 --> 35:55.875
You know you're not really

35:53.125 --> 35:55.875
such a bad sort, Ral,

35:55.917 --> 35:57.625
except you don't have

35:55.917 --> 35:57.625
any values

35:57.667 --> 36:00.750
beyond the value

35:57.667 --> 36:00.750
of today's bid, that is.

36:02.166 --> 36:06.166
Deanna is just the woman

36:02.166 --> 36:06.166
to bring some meaning

36:06.208 --> 36:07.667
to your sorry existence,

36:07.709 --> 36:10.417
if you're smart enough

36:07.709 --> 36:10.417
to take it.

36:10.458 --> 36:12.500
I doubt that you are.

36:14.500 --> 36:16.500
To the last mile.

36:29.250 --> 36:31.917
Sir, the Ferengi vessel

36:29.250 --> 36:31.917
is moving

36:31.959 --> 36:35.041
out of orbit--

36:31.959 --> 36:35.041
impulse power.

36:35.083 --> 36:39.000
They are approaching the entry

36:35.083 --> 36:39.000
to the wormhole, sir.

36:39.041 --> 36:42.250
Computer, is the Ferengi Goss

36:39.041 --> 36:42.250
still on board the<i> Enterprise?</i>

36:42.291 --> 36:45.333
DaiMon Goss departed

36:42.291 --> 36:45.333
the<i> Enterprise</i> at 1400 hours.

36:45.375 --> 36:47.166
They are powering forward

36:45.375 --> 36:47.166
missile launchers, sir.

36:47.208 --> 36:49.834
Yellow alert.

36:47.208 --> 36:49.834
Hail the Ferengi.

36:52.041 --> 36:54.667
Request an explanation of

36:52.041 --> 36:54.667
your actions, DaiMon Goss.

36:54.709 --> 36:56.834
I have learned

36:54.709 --> 36:56.834
from informed sources

36:56.875 --> 36:58.542
that the Federation

36:56.875 --> 36:58.542
has manipulated

36:58.583 --> 37:01.375
these negotiations from

36:58.583 --> 37:01.375
the very beginning,

37:01.417 --> 37:04.208
and has already signed a secret

37:01.417 --> 37:04.208
agreement with the Barzans.

37:04.250 --> 37:05.667
That is not true.

37:05.709 --> 37:09.083
The Ferengi offer was

37:05.709 --> 37:09.083
never seriously considered.

37:09.125 --> 37:12.166
Premier Bhavani welcomed you

37:09.125 --> 37:12.166
to these proceedings

37:12.208 --> 37:14.041
despite my better judgment.

37:14.083 --> 37:16.625
We will be ignored

37:14.083 --> 37:16.625
no longer.

37:18.166 --> 37:20.250
They've fired a missile

37:18.166 --> 37:20.250
directly at the opening, sir.

37:20.291 --> 37:22.333
Destroy it.

37:20.291 --> 37:22.333
On screen.

37:22.375 --> 37:24.417
Firing phasers.

37:28.709 --> 37:32.500
Your offers both

37:28.709 --> 37:32.500
have merit, gentlemen.

37:32.542 --> 37:33.792
If I could find

37:32.542 --> 37:33.792
a deciding factor--

37:33.834 --> 37:36.291
(<i> alarm klaxon blaring</i> )

37:36.333 --> 37:38.458
Riker to Picard.

37:36.333 --> 37:38.458
What's happening, Captain?

37:38.500 --> 37:40.917
Goss has fired a missile

37:38.500 --> 37:40.917
at the wormhole.

37:40.959 --> 37:42.458
I need you on the bridge,

37:40.959 --> 37:42.458
Number One.

37:42.500 --> 37:44.458
Excuse me.

37:47.750 --> 37:50.917
Excuse me for saying so under

37:47.750 --> 37:50.917
the circumstances, Premier,

37:50.959 --> 37:53.375
but this fight

37:50.959 --> 37:53.375
seems to really be

37:53.417 --> 37:56.750
between the Federation

37:53.417 --> 37:56.750
and the Ferengi.

37:56.792 --> 37:59.709
Now, it seems unconscionable

37:56.792 --> 37:59.709
that your wormhole

37:59.750 --> 38:02.709
is being used as a pawn

37:59.750 --> 38:02.709
in their power struggle.

38:04.125 --> 38:06.542
You must know we will not

38:04.125 --> 38:06.542
allow you to do this.

38:06.583 --> 38:09.625
If the Ferengi cannot have

38:06.583 --> 38:09.625
the wormhole, no one will.

38:09.667 --> 38:11.542
A missile will have

38:09.667 --> 38:11.542
no destructive effect

38:11.583 --> 38:12.917
on a wormhole.

38:12.959 --> 38:14.792
But if it should explode

38:12.959 --> 38:14.792
near the shuttlecraft,

38:14.834 --> 38:16.500
they will be destroyed.

38:16.542 --> 38:18.750
Casualties of war,

38:16.542 --> 38:18.750
Captain.

38:18.792 --> 38:22.208
My men are prepared to die.

38:18.792 --> 38:22.208
Are yours?

38:23.125 --> 38:25.500
Captain, he's lying.

38:25.542 --> 38:28.583
I'm almost sure of it.

38:25.542 --> 38:28.583
He doesn't mean what he says.

38:28.625 --> 38:31.000
Why? What is he

38:28.625 --> 38:31.000
doing it for, then?

38:31.041 --> 38:32.750
(<i> door whooshes open</i> )

38:34.917 --> 38:36.625
Permission to enter

38:34.917 --> 38:36.625
the bridge, Captain.

38:36.667 --> 38:38.041
Premier, with all

38:36.667 --> 38:38.041
due respect--

38:38.083 --> 38:40.250
Captain, I believe I am

38:38.083 --> 38:40.250
in a better position

38:40.291 --> 38:42.959
to settle this with DaiMon Goss

38:40.291 --> 38:42.959
than you are.

38:43.000 --> 38:44.792
May I address him?

38:47.041 --> 38:48.625
Premier?

38:57.125 --> 38:58.291
DaiMon Goss?

38:58.333 --> 38:59.542
This is Devinoni Ral.

38:59.583 --> 39:01.709
I have nothing

38:59.583 --> 39:01.709
to say to you, Ral.

39:01.750 --> 39:04.208
Well,

39:01.750 --> 39:04.208
then just listen.

39:04.250 --> 39:06.667
The planet Barzan

39:04.250 --> 39:06.667
has reached an agreement

39:06.709 --> 39:08.458
with the Chrysalians

39:08.500 --> 39:11.041
for long-term control

39:08.500 --> 39:11.041
of the wormhole.

39:11.083 --> 39:13.000
Now, on behalf

39:11.083 --> 39:13.000
of the Chrysalians,

39:13.041 --> 39:14.625
I am prepared to offer

39:13.041 --> 39:14.625
the Ferengi

39:14.667 --> 39:18.375
free access to the wormhole in

39:14.667 --> 39:18.375
perpetuity.

39:18.417 --> 39:19.917
I have your word

39:18.417 --> 39:19.917
on this?

39:19.959 --> 39:22.375
Yes, my word, sir.

39:22.417 --> 39:24.625
In exchange for Ferengi

39:22.417 --> 39:24.625
convoy privileges

39:24.667 --> 39:27.375
to be negotiated

39:24.667 --> 39:27.375
in good faith.

39:27.417 --> 39:29.709
This is an acceptable offer.

39:31.375 --> 39:34.709
The Ferengi vessel has shut down

39:31.375 --> 39:34.709
its forward missile launcher.

39:34.750 --> 39:36.875
Stand down red alert.

39:36.917 --> 39:39.458
Commander Riker...

39:39.500 --> 39:41.083
I'm sorry you

39:39.500 --> 39:41.083
had to learn about

39:41.125 --> 39:43.417
my decision this way.

39:43.458 --> 39:45.959
You represented

39:43.458 --> 39:45.959
the Federation well.

39:46.000 --> 39:47.500
But I have come

39:46.000 --> 39:47.500
to believe

39:47.542 --> 39:49.917
that the Chrysalian's

39:47.542 --> 39:49.917
tradition of peace

39:49.959 --> 39:52.542
is more desirable

39:49.959 --> 39:52.542
to my planet.

39:53.458 --> 39:54.625
Excuse me, Premier.

39:54.667 --> 39:57.542
There's something

39:54.667 --> 39:57.542
you should know.

39:59.667 --> 40:02.333
I'm sorry, was there

39:59.667 --> 40:02.333
something you wanted to say?

40:02.375 --> 40:04.291
No, not at all.

40:04.333 --> 40:06.917
I have sensed you suddenly

40:04.333 --> 40:06.917
felt uncomfortable.

40:08.250 --> 40:11.250
Well, after all, it was

40:08.250 --> 40:11.250
a very tense situation.

40:11.291 --> 40:13.125
But that's what's so odd.

40:13.166 --> 40:15.041
It wasn't tense at all.

40:15.083 --> 40:16.792
In fact,

40:15.083 --> 40:16.792
I sensed no tension

40:16.834 --> 40:18.166
from you or Goss.

40:18.208 --> 40:20.375
Wha-- I--

40:18.208 --> 40:20.375
I was tense!

40:20.417 --> 40:21.917
I was ready to blow it up!

40:21.959 --> 40:24.000
Wha-- I strongly protest!

40:24.041 --> 40:25.667
Screen off.

40:25.709 --> 40:26.834
It was as though

40:25.709 --> 40:26.834
you were

40:26.875 --> 40:29.417
performing a scene

40:26.875 --> 40:29.417
for all of us.

40:30.375 --> 40:31.792
Pardon me, Captain, I--

40:31.834 --> 40:34.125
I believe there's a slight

40:31.834 --> 40:34.125
conflict of interest here.

40:34.166 --> 40:36.625
I agree entirely.

40:36.667 --> 40:39.041
Mr. Ral asked me

40:36.667 --> 40:39.041
not to tell anyone

40:39.083 --> 40:41.834
he has empathic

40:39.083 --> 40:41.834
powers,

40:41.875 --> 40:44.542
which he uses to manipulate

40:41.875 --> 40:44.542
his competitors

40:44.583 --> 40:47.125
in a negotiation.

40:44.583 --> 40:47.125
And, yes,

40:47.166 --> 40:49.834
it did put me in

40:47.166 --> 40:49.834
a conflict of interest,

40:49.875 --> 40:52.208
which I hope

40:49.875 --> 40:52.208
I have now resolved.

40:53.667 --> 40:55.166
Premier, I believe Ral

40:55.208 --> 40:57.583
has used your fear

40:55.208 --> 40:57.583
of continuing aggression

40:57.625 --> 41:00.000
between the Federation

40:57.625 --> 41:00.000
and its enemies

41:00.041 --> 41:03.083
to undermine

41:00.041 --> 41:03.083
our position.

41:03.125 --> 41:05.500
I also believe that

41:03.125 --> 41:05.500
this incident

41:05.542 --> 41:09.000
was staged by Ral and Goss

41:05.542 --> 41:09.000
to provide you a reason

41:09.041 --> 41:12.000
to choose in favor

41:09.041 --> 41:12.000
of the Chrysalians.

41:13.250 --> 41:14.542
Captain, it's

41:13.250 --> 41:14.542
the shuttlecraft,

41:14.583 --> 41:16.041
they're coming

41:14.583 --> 41:16.041
back through.

41:19.250 --> 41:21.208
GEORDI:

41:19.250 --> 41:21.208
Shuttle Nine to<i> Enterprise.</i>

41:21.250 --> 41:22.959
On screen.

41:24.959 --> 41:27.875
This is shuttle Nine

41:24.959 --> 41:27.875
reporting in.

41:27.917 --> 41:29.250
Barely.

41:29.291 --> 41:31.250
PICARD:

41:29.291 --> 41:31.250
And the Ferengi pod, Commander?

41:31.291 --> 41:33.500
Trapped on

41:31.291 --> 41:33.500
the other side, sir.

41:33.542 --> 41:36.041
In Delta Quadrant.

41:33.542 --> 41:36.041
We tried to warn them.

41:36.083 --> 41:37.583
They wouldn't follow us.

41:37.625 --> 41:39.125
Elaborate.

41:39.166 --> 41:43.125
Captain, this end of the

41:39.166 --> 41:43.125
wormhole is currently stable,

41:43.166 --> 41:46.667
but the other end apparently

41:43.166 --> 41:46.667
shifts positions periodically.

41:46.709 --> 41:49.333
The Barzan probe had no way

41:46.709 --> 41:49.333
to recognize this.

41:49.375 --> 41:52.875
Eventually, both sides

41:49.375 --> 41:52.875
will be unstable.

41:52.917 --> 41:55.583
GEORDI: It's a dry well,

41:52.917 --> 41:55.583
Captain-- worthless.

41:55.625 --> 41:57.709
Acknowledged, shuttle.

41:57.750 --> 42:00.750
Main shuttle bay,

41:57.750 --> 42:00.750
prepare for final approach.

42:00.792 --> 42:02.125
MAN:

42:00.792 --> 42:02.125
Aye, sir.

42:02.166 --> 42:04.875
WORF: Captain, DaiMon Goss

42:02.166 --> 42:04.875
is demanding

42:04.917 --> 42:07.583
to know where

42:04.917 --> 42:07.583
his men are.

42:07.625 --> 42:09.458
Advise him to set

42:07.625 --> 42:09.458
his coordinates

42:09.500 --> 42:10.792
for the Delta Quadrant.

42:10.834 --> 42:15.333
He may run into them

42:10.834 --> 42:15.333
in 80 years or so.

42:17.166 --> 42:19.750
Mr. Ral...

42:19.792 --> 42:21.542
congratulations on winning

42:19.792 --> 42:21.542
the rights

42:21.583 --> 42:23.625
to the Barzan wormhole.

42:23.667 --> 42:26.500
I take the risks,

42:23.667 --> 42:26.500
Mr. Riker.

42:26.542 --> 42:29.834
And I stand by

42:26.542 --> 42:29.834
my agreements.

42:33.500 --> 42:35.417
Come in.

42:43.834 --> 42:45.041
When do you leave?

42:45.083 --> 42:46.583
Soon.

42:46.625 --> 42:49.000
I've been recalled

42:46.625 --> 42:49.000
by the Chrysalians.

42:49.041 --> 42:51.083
Explanations demanded,

42:49.041 --> 42:51.083
and so forth.

42:51.125 --> 42:52.625
I'm sorry.

42:52.667 --> 42:54.834
Well, I've done well

42:52.667 --> 42:54.834
for them over the years.

42:54.875 --> 42:56.959
They understand the stakes.

42:57.000 --> 42:59.417
It'll be fine.

43:00.709 --> 43:03.083
I had to do it, Troi.

43:03.125 --> 43:05.875
Bhavani was ready to go

43:03.125 --> 43:05.875
with the Federation.

43:05.917 --> 43:08.291
I sensed it.

43:08.333 --> 43:10.667
I'd used up every card

43:08.333 --> 43:10.667
in the deck.

43:10.709 --> 43:12.458
I needed to change

43:10.709 --> 43:12.458
the rules.

43:12.500 --> 43:14.083
You must have known

43:12.500 --> 43:14.083
I couldn't

43:14.125 --> 43:15.875
allow you to do that.

43:17.792 --> 43:19.125
My human physical response

43:19.166 --> 43:23.291
must have been blocking

43:19.166 --> 43:23.291
my Betazoid senses.

43:26.959 --> 43:29.166
I'm very grateful for

43:26.959 --> 43:29.166
what you did, in a way.

43:31.125 --> 43:33.542
It's made me take

43:31.125 --> 43:33.542
a hard look at who I am.

43:36.000 --> 43:37.667
I don't like what I see.

43:39.000 --> 43:42.250
I once asked you

43:39.000 --> 43:42.250
to run away with me.

43:42.291 --> 43:44.333
Now I'm asking again.

43:46.083 --> 43:49.375
I need you.

43:49.417 --> 43:51.458
You could help me change.

43:49.417 --> 43:51.458
You could--

43:51.500 --> 43:53.625
You could be

43:51.500 --> 43:53.625
my conscience.

44:06.792 --> 44:10.333
I already have a job

44:06.792 --> 44:10.333
as Counselor.
