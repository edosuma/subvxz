00:01.088 --> 00:02.785
<i>Last time on</i> Naomi...

00:02.828 --> 00:05.222
<i>There was a UFO sighting</i> <i>
back in Port Oswego in 2004.</i>

00:05.266 --> 00:07.311
<i>I'm going to figure out
what really happened that day.</i>

00:07.355 --> 00:10.314
I am not leaving you alone
with the criminals
doing creepy things

00:10.358 --> 00:11.402
<i>inside a creepy mill.</i>

00:11.446 --> 00:13.491
<i>Zumbado is dangerous.</i>

00:13.535 --> 00:15.537
He's the who ruined earth 29.

00:15.580 --> 00:16.755
Is that where I'm from?

00:16.799 --> 00:18.235
The universe is vast.

00:18.279 --> 00:20.846
There are more planets
than humans can even count it.

00:20.890 --> 00:23.545
<i>Bounty hunters, they carry</i> <i>
the record of their targets.</i>

00:23.588 --> 00:27.375
There is another name
on the list that will be
of interest to you, Qyeala.

00:27.418 --> 00:29.377
So we're doing this?
The real version?

00:29.420 --> 00:30.639
The real version.

00:51.138 --> 00:52.226
Hi, Dee.

00:53.401 --> 00:55.229
Nice sesh, Pumpkin.

00:55.272 --> 00:58.275
Dad, what did we say about
using skateboard slang?

00:59.233 --> 01:01.235
Strongly discouraged. Right.

01:01.278 --> 01:03.367
Oh! I enjoy these sessions
a lot more

01:03.411 --> 01:05.369
when there were pads
and helmet involved.

01:05.413 --> 01:07.719
I stopped wearing those
when I was 12.

01:07.763 --> 01:10.200
And I've been holding
my breath ever since.

01:10.244 --> 01:12.115
Hot dog or churro, ladies?

01:12.159 --> 01:13.203
Churro.

01:13.247 --> 01:14.683
Three churros, please.

01:14.726 --> 01:16.119
It's been a minute since we've
had a skateboard Sunday.

01:16.163 --> 01:17.425
You remember our first one?

01:18.252 --> 01:19.949
Tokyo.

01:19.992 --> 01:22.734
How can I forget?
Mom took about
a hundred pictures.

01:22.778 --> 01:24.562
Actually,
make that 200.

01:24.606 --> 01:27.913
Hey! Taking too many photos
is my duty as a mother.

01:31.874 --> 01:33.310
A lot has changed since then.

01:34.529 --> 01:35.704
Yeah, but not everything.

01:47.803 --> 01:50.632
Stay away from Zumbado.
He's dangerous.

02:08.867 --> 02:10.782
Thank you
for coming, everyone.

02:10.826 --> 02:13.350
And thank you for all
your hard work over these
past couple of months.

02:14.482 --> 02:16.440
The big week is finally here.

02:18.007 --> 02:20.966
The first order of Homecoming
committee business

02:21.010 --> 02:22.446
is our fundraising check-in.

02:22.490 --> 02:25.145
Annabelle, let's see the board.

02:27.408 --> 02:29.018
- Whoo!
- Yes!

02:29.061 --> 02:31.629
As you can see, the soccer team
is in first place.

02:31.673 --> 02:33.283
I'm sure
it's a total coincidence

02:33.327 --> 02:35.372
that your boyfriend's club
is winning.

02:35.416 --> 02:37.853
We've been hardcore
fundraising for weeks.

02:37.896 --> 02:41.204
Plus, we're gonna raise
even more money at our game
on Saturday.

02:41.248 --> 02:43.163
We're winning that trophy.

02:43.206 --> 02:46.818
Oh! Uh, no, no way.
Architecture club has got
that lock down.

02:46.862 --> 02:49.734
Right. Because you guys
are building a float
about logging?

02:49.778 --> 02:53.347
Okay. The important thing
is that we're raising money
for our school.

02:53.390 --> 02:55.479
- And also the trophy.
- Whoo! Yeah.

02:55.523 --> 02:59.396
My dad has agreed to take
a pie in the face, so student
council has this on lock.

02:59.440 --> 03:02.486
He won the trophy
all four years he went
to school here.

03:02.530 --> 03:05.489
Okay. Uh, moving on
to number two,

03:05.533 --> 03:08.753
the marching band's petition
for an all-Lizzo setlist.

03:08.797 --> 03:10.538
Her flute is verified
on Instagram.

03:10.581 --> 03:12.540
The motion passes.

03:12.583 --> 03:15.586
How are even on this committee?
You're not in-charge of a club.

03:15.630 --> 03:17.458
I'm a member-at-large.

03:20.809 --> 03:23.942
Eddie revolutionized
the guitar solo.

03:23.986 --> 03:26.118
He created a new sound.

03:26.162 --> 03:28.251
I hear you, Miss Bennett.
It's just that...

03:28.295 --> 03:31.080
Van Halen is more
your generation, we're all
about Doja Cat.

03:31.123 --> 03:34.039
Is that a person or an animal?

03:34.083 --> 03:35.215
Fair point.

03:38.653 --> 03:40.698
Is Miss Bennett
starting a band?

03:40.742 --> 03:43.135
This used to be her locker,
so she was not too happy

03:43.179 --> 03:45.573
to find out that I scraped off
her Van Halen sticker.

03:47.575 --> 03:50.273
It must be nice to spend
your whole life in one place.

03:50.317 --> 03:52.057
Feel like you really
belong somewhere.

03:52.101 --> 03:53.407
I thought you loved
Port Oswego.

03:53.450 --> 03:54.973
No, I do.

03:55.017 --> 03:57.933
I just wish I knew more about
where I was from.

03:57.976 --> 03:59.543
I feel like I just keep
hitting dead ends.

03:59.587 --> 04:02.285
What about not-counselor-Jeff
and those neon crystals?

04:02.329 --> 04:04.548
I mean, you said that the case
had those weird markings.

04:04.592 --> 04:06.158
Jeff's gone.

04:06.202 --> 04:09.379
And I asked Dee about Dilustel,
but he doesn't know.

04:09.423 --> 04:11.555
There's the only one person
who can give me answers,

04:11.599 --> 04:13.383
and he won't give them to me.

04:13.427 --> 04:17.474
Right. Our favorite
used car salesman slash
cryptic scary guy.

04:17.518 --> 04:20.085
What is Zumbado hiding?

04:20.129 --> 04:22.131
Sometimes it feels like
he's just watching me.

04:24.655 --> 04:25.613
Hang on.

04:26.353 --> 04:28.355
That's the key.

04:28.398 --> 04:31.314
Zumbado showed up in the woods
after this Superman thing
and then, he also

04:31.358 --> 04:32.794
showed up in Falls Creek.

04:32.837 --> 04:34.404
Oh, no!

04:34.448 --> 04:36.754
Please tell me this is not
another creepy mill thing.

04:36.798 --> 04:38.278
I give it zero
out of five stars.

04:41.716 --> 04:43.457
It's another creepy mill thing.

04:56.992 --> 04:58.776
Very good.

04:58.820 --> 05:00.343
The goal here is fluidity.

05:01.823 --> 05:03.825
This will be our last session
for a few days.

05:05.174 --> 05:06.044
Why?

05:07.916 --> 05:09.004
Keep it flowing.

05:10.484 --> 05:13.530
It's a personal matter
about Qyeala.

05:14.488 --> 05:15.837
I found new information.

05:17.839 --> 05:19.362
You think she might be alive?

05:19.406 --> 05:20.842
I don't know what to think.

05:23.584 --> 05:27.239
But... you can utilize
the space while I'm gone.

05:28.197 --> 05:30.199
You need to keep practicing.

05:33.898 --> 05:35.987
Why do I have to learn
how to fight?

05:36.031 --> 05:38.381
Can't I just use my powers?

05:38.425 --> 05:41.993
It is easy for powers
to become a crutch.

05:42.037 --> 05:44.256
I've seen it happen before.

05:44.300 --> 05:46.563
- Superman seems to be doing okay.
- True.

05:46.607 --> 05:51.873
But one day, he may face
someone who has powers
and skill.

05:51.916 --> 05:54.571
So you're saying,
if I learn how to use these...

05:54.615 --> 05:56.225
I might be better
than Superman.

05:57.400 --> 05:59.359
Maybe. One day.

06:00.882 --> 06:03.667
On Thanagar,
women are warriors.

06:03.711 --> 06:07.497
Girls on this planet
talk about being protected
by man.

06:07.541 --> 06:09.891
But you do not need
a boy around.

06:11.414 --> 06:13.373
It's not always bad
to have a boy around.

06:15.549 --> 06:17.942
Naomi, what are you
talking about?

06:19.335 --> 06:20.728
Uh, Hi.

06:21.555 --> 06:23.383
Nathan, hi.

06:24.601 --> 06:27.212
Oh! Nice ninja sticks.

06:27.256 --> 06:30.520
Oh! When I told you
to meet me here, I kind of
meant outside.

06:30.564 --> 06:32.392
I wanna see
where the magic happens.

06:35.351 --> 06:36.352
Boxing lessons.

06:38.136 --> 06:38.963
Boxing?

06:40.095 --> 06:40.922
Magic.

06:43.490 --> 06:44.404
Right.

06:48.320 --> 06:52.499
I hope you make
your mental and emotional
health a priority.

06:53.587 --> 06:56.154
I, uh, have a meditation app.

06:58.853 --> 07:00.028
I don't use it that much.

07:02.770 --> 07:04.902
But soccer helps
keep my head straight.

07:04.946 --> 07:06.817
Oh! We, we should go.

07:06.861 --> 07:09.516
Uh, thank you, Dee.
I'll see you when you get back.

07:16.348 --> 07:20.352
I never would've thought
that Dee would care so much
about mental health.

07:22.311 --> 07:24.444
How did boxing happen anyway?

07:24.487 --> 07:27.621
Um, it's, it's kind of
a long story.

07:31.146 --> 07:32.452
So you're gonna show me
your moves?

07:33.888 --> 07:37.152
Ooh! You're not ready
for my moves.

07:37.195 --> 07:39.807
- I guess not.
- Yeah, guess not.

07:40.677 --> 07:43.114
This town loves its Homecoming.

07:43.158 --> 07:45.595
I know.

07:45.639 --> 07:48.163
You ever wished you hadn't move
around so much growing up?

07:48.990 --> 07:50.600
Yeah, sometimes.

07:50.644 --> 07:54.517
But not very kid gets to say
they've eaten barbecue in Seoul

07:54.561 --> 07:56.388
or played soccer in Berlin.

07:58.173 --> 08:00.218
I guess moving around
does have its perks.

08:00.262 --> 08:01.611
Oh! Like meeting me?

08:01.655 --> 08:03.483
No!

08:03.526 --> 08:05.485
- All the great food.
- All right.

08:20.456 --> 08:22.153
Hello, old friend.

08:22.197 --> 08:24.286
I thought we'd already said
our tearful goodbye.

08:42.391 --> 08:44.262
Where are the markings?
They were right here.

08:45.873 --> 08:49.354
Maybe the wall's just dirty.

08:49.398 --> 08:51.922
This place could use
a deep clean.

08:51.966 --> 08:54.664
No, there's no paint.
It's not sanded.

08:54.708 --> 08:56.274
It just disappeared.

09:09.592 --> 09:11.725
Annabelle, I think I can see
through here.

09:11.768 --> 09:14.771
Yes, I knew it.
I knew you would've
X-ray vision.

09:14.815 --> 09:16.468
OMG, can you see inside of me?

09:16.512 --> 09:18.253
How's my heart?
Am I getting enough iron?

09:24.346 --> 09:25.826
Whoa!

09:36.488 --> 09:38.665
For a secret room,
I am a little underwhelmed.

09:53.288 --> 09:54.724
Babe?

09:54.768 --> 09:57.074
Is it just me or does that
look a lot like--

09:57.118 --> 09:58.293
A spaceship.

10:07.868 --> 10:09.913
I can't believe I touched
a spaceship.

10:09.957 --> 10:12.655
I can't believe I touched
your spaceship.

10:12.699 --> 10:15.310
That must be why Zumbado
was trying to keep me away
from the mill.

10:16.964 --> 10:18.792
But if you got here
in a spaceship,

10:18.835 --> 10:20.358
then how did you end up
on the rock?

10:23.187 --> 10:24.754
That's what I need to find out.

10:24.798 --> 10:27.191
And you're going
to do that, how?

10:29.324 --> 10:30.630
By...

10:32.022 --> 10:34.459
analyzing these.

10:34.503 --> 10:38.159
I'm pretty sure we've been
put on that geology lab's
"Ban for life" list.

10:38.202 --> 10:40.988
I found someone who I think
might be able to help.

10:41.031 --> 10:42.990
Her name is Dr. Bell.
She is a physicist

10:43.033 --> 10:44.774
who specializes
in string theory.

10:44.818 --> 10:46.254
What are you gonna say to her?

10:46.297 --> 10:49.518
Hi, I'm Naomi. Can you help me
analyze my spaceship?

10:49.561 --> 10:52.564
Dr. Bell has written a bunch
of papers on asteroids.

10:52.608 --> 10:55.132
I'll say I found these
in the woods.

10:55.176 --> 10:56.917
I don't know, babe.
Seems risky.

10:59.354 --> 11:01.486
I need answers.

11:01.530 --> 11:04.402
And Dr. Bell is my best chance
at finding them.

11:04.446 --> 11:05.708
The research facility
she works at,

11:05.752 --> 11:08.842
it has a college
internship program.

11:08.885 --> 11:10.408
You're not in college.

11:11.540 --> 11:12.889
I'm going to be tomorrow.

11:26.860 --> 11:27.948
What the hell?

11:30.254 --> 11:31.516
Nathan?

11:31.560 --> 11:33.083
What's your problem, man?

11:33.127 --> 11:34.345
What?

11:34.389 --> 11:35.869
You did this.

11:35.912 --> 11:38.349
Right. You really think I care
about your paper-mache?

11:38.393 --> 11:40.525
They're wearing army uniforms.

11:40.569 --> 11:42.702
There are lot of military kids
who go to this school.

11:42.745 --> 11:44.051
Yeah, but only one
who has it out for me.

11:44.094 --> 11:45.182
I seriously doubt that.

11:45.226 --> 11:46.662
You were making fun of it.

11:46.706 --> 11:49.752
Because this is lame.
It doesn't mean I trashed it.

11:49.796 --> 11:53.277
Homecoming has been
going on in Port Oswego
for a hundred years.

11:53.321 --> 11:55.062
It means something to us.

11:55.105 --> 11:57.455
It's typical military
not caring about our town.

11:57.499 --> 12:00.502
The military brings a bunch
of money to this town.
You're welcome.

12:04.593 --> 12:06.377
What is going on in here?

12:06.421 --> 12:07.596
He started it.

12:08.336 --> 12:10.468
Detention. Both of you.

12:43.284 --> 12:44.198
Adam.

12:44.938 --> 12:46.156
Thanks for coming.

12:47.854 --> 12:50.421
What is this place?

12:50.465 --> 12:53.468
This is where people like us
come when they get stranded.

12:55.470 --> 12:56.601
Stranded.

12:56.645 --> 12:58.255
In this universe.

12:58.299 --> 12:59.561
When they can't find
their way home.

13:01.084 --> 13:03.739
You gonna tell me why you
had me track down a mercenary?

13:05.045 --> 13:06.263
It's about Qyeala.

13:09.049 --> 13:10.790
It's been a while
since I've heard that name.

13:12.530 --> 13:14.315
- I though she was--
- I thought so, too.

13:16.491 --> 13:18.710
Until I saw her name
on the bounty hunter list.

13:22.236 --> 13:24.891
You're the only lovestruck
Thanagarian I've ever known.

13:26.893 --> 13:29.025
Vulnerability is not
exactly encouraged.

13:32.159 --> 13:33.682
We are warriors.

13:36.424 --> 13:38.339
That is why Q and I
decided to get out.

13:39.340 --> 13:40.950
You never told me that.

13:40.994 --> 13:44.171
We were on a planet
in a different universe,

13:44.214 --> 13:45.825
fighting yet another war.

13:48.044 --> 13:49.567
The things we saw...

13:51.265 --> 13:53.528
We've seen it before,
of course,

13:53.571 --> 13:54.964
hundreds of times.

13:55.008 --> 13:56.531
But this time it's different.

14:01.536 --> 14:04.887
It showed us that
we did not want
that life anymore.

14:04.931 --> 14:07.237
So you decided
to come to Earth?

14:07.281 --> 14:09.370
Yeah. I heard
about Port Oswego...

14:10.806 --> 14:13.809
I do not remember where or how?

14:15.028 --> 14:17.073
We could not go together.
It was too risky.

14:18.074 --> 14:19.597
So we made a plan to meet.

14:23.950 --> 14:25.038
But she never made it.

14:28.606 --> 14:33.089
Just because she's on that list
doesn't mean she's alive.

14:33.133 --> 14:36.310
I know it is a long shot,
but it is better
than not knowing.

14:38.573 --> 14:40.575
Lux might have an answer.
Where is he?

14:48.496 --> 14:50.498
Let us find out what he knows.

15:17.786 --> 15:20.267
How did you get back here?
This area is off limits.

15:22.095 --> 15:23.966
Speak. I can hear you.

15:24.010 --> 15:27.927
I'm Naomi McDuffie.
I'm here about
the college internship.

15:27.970 --> 15:30.451
Really?
What are you, 16?

15:32.496 --> 15:35.064
I made that appointment
because I needed to see you.

15:35.108 --> 15:37.762
I found something that I think
you might be interested in.

15:37.806 --> 15:39.460
I don't think that
it's from this Earth.

15:40.635 --> 15:41.897
Step through to the lab.

15:55.563 --> 15:56.825
What do you have to show me?

16:02.744 --> 16:06.530
I found this
after a meteor strike.

16:06.574 --> 16:09.794
I was hoping
you may be able
to tell me about its origin.

16:09.838 --> 16:11.057
It's just for a school project.

16:12.536 --> 16:14.408
A school project. Right.

16:18.325 --> 16:20.849
Well, Miss McDuffie,
you are correct.

16:23.678 --> 16:25.419
It is clearly
not from this Earth.

16:26.768 --> 16:28.770
It's likely technology
involved with a spaceship.

16:32.078 --> 16:33.993
I assume yours.

16:34.036 --> 16:37.822
What? No.
Why would you think that?

16:37.866 --> 16:39.215
Because you're not
from this Earth.

16:48.529 --> 16:49.660
There has to be
some kind of mistake.

16:49.704 --> 16:50.879
I don't make mistakes.

16:51.793 --> 16:53.751
I am sorry. I should go.

16:53.795 --> 16:56.189
I didn't mean to scare you.

16:56.232 --> 16:59.409
I understand your reluctance...
and you're welcome to leave.

16:59.453 --> 17:02.586
But you're not the first
interdimensional being
that I've met.

17:05.720 --> 17:07.678
How did you know?

17:07.722 --> 17:10.420
My work deals with
understanding energies
of all kinds.

17:10.464 --> 17:13.206
That automatically scans anyone
who steps into this room.

17:15.730 --> 17:17.949
I thought you studied
string theory.

17:17.993 --> 17:19.690
It led to my
breakthrough discovery.

17:19.734 --> 17:21.518
That there is life
on other worlds.

17:21.562 --> 17:23.738
And some of that life exists
here on Earth.

17:26.784 --> 17:28.221
You're a Superman fan.

17:29.744 --> 17:31.354
You know him?

17:31.398 --> 17:34.444
No, not personally,
but we have some...
mutual friends.

17:36.751 --> 17:38.883
Your scan was very revealing.

17:38.927 --> 17:41.321
Your energy signature
is vacillating rapidly.

17:44.019 --> 17:47.414
I suspect your powers
have been difficult to control?

17:48.154 --> 17:49.024
If I may...

17:50.460 --> 17:51.766
you'll hear a hum.

17:57.119 --> 17:58.816
This should help temporarily.

17:58.860 --> 18:00.601
Try something
that's been a struggle.

18:17.661 --> 18:18.880
Stop.

18:21.970 --> 18:23.667
It's a concept
called resonance.

18:23.711 --> 18:25.452
It can help focus your energy.

18:32.459 --> 18:33.895
Why do you want to help me?

18:34.983 --> 18:36.376
All of us are energy.

18:36.419 --> 18:38.682
Human, alien. We're all pieces
of the same puzzle.

18:40.380 --> 18:42.121
Understanding more of
what binds us together

18:42.164 --> 18:44.166
will unlock the secrets
of the universe.

18:52.305 --> 18:54.568
Do you think
you can find Earth-29?

19:00.182 --> 19:01.488
That's where I'm from.

19:02.750 --> 19:04.360
I can certainly try.

19:21.334 --> 19:22.770
Can you stop that, please?

19:28.428 --> 19:31.735
You know staring at the clock
isn't going to get us
out of here any faster.

19:31.779 --> 19:34.303
I'm supposed to be at practice.

19:34.347 --> 19:37.176
But instead, I'm here...
with you.

19:37.219 --> 19:39.178
Yeah, I'm not too happy
about it either.

19:44.270 --> 19:47.055
It's not that
you'll believe me, but

19:47.098 --> 19:49.231
I wasn't the one
who messed up your float.

19:49.275 --> 19:51.102
Sure.

19:51.712 --> 19:53.409
Whatever you say.

19:55.455 --> 19:56.934
Is this about Naomi?

19:59.546 --> 20:01.243
Do you really think
I'm that petty?

20:04.290 --> 20:05.856
No.

20:05.900 --> 20:08.250
Although I don't think
you're good enough for her.

20:08.294 --> 20:09.295
And you are?

20:13.255 --> 20:15.257
Do you remember
my first day here?

20:15.301 --> 20:17.128
No, not really.

20:17.172 --> 20:19.696
You were assigned
to show me around,

20:19.740 --> 20:23.047
but you ditched me
by third period.

20:23.091 --> 20:26.312
Said something about me
just being another army brat.

20:28.139 --> 20:31.752
Okay. You were never really
that nice to me either.

20:31.795 --> 20:34.407
You gave me the wrong address
to your party.

20:37.627 --> 20:38.933
You don't even know me.

20:40.021 --> 20:41.936
I know guys like you.

20:41.979 --> 20:45.809
You come through here,
but you don't really care
about Port Oswego.

20:45.853 --> 20:47.158
You're just passing through.

20:47.202 --> 20:51.075
You don't care that our history
is being erased.

20:51.119 --> 20:54.601
Because what would I know
about someone trying
to erase my history?

21:02.348 --> 21:04.001
You don t know me either.

21:06.613 --> 21:08.745
You're right.

21:08.789 --> 21:12.271
But I'm telling you,
I didn't mess with your float.

21:17.145 --> 21:17.972
Okay.

21:19.800 --> 21:22.498
But if you didn't,
then who did?

21:24.805 --> 21:26.285
Maybe we should find out.

21:36.512 --> 21:40.429
Mr. Lux. I need a word, please.

21:40.473 --> 21:42.692
And I need another beer.

21:42.736 --> 21:44.694
They say the real drinking

21:44.738 --> 21:46.696
is the friends
you make along the way.

21:48.219 --> 21:50.178
What is this, a shake down?

21:51.092 --> 21:53.050
I want information

21:53.094 --> 21:55.052
about a woman named Qyeala.

21:56.010 --> 21:57.316
Doesn't ring a bell.

21:58.012 --> 21:59.274
He says otherwise.

21:59.318 --> 22:01.320
I don't care what he says.
I'm here to drink.

22:09.545 --> 22:11.547
Where did you get that ring?

22:11.591 --> 22:12.418
I don't remember.

22:17.771 --> 22:19.990
Look at it. Look at it!

22:20.034 --> 22:23.690
This ring is the only match
to the one around your neck.

22:24.430 --> 22:25.735
Tell me where you got it.

22:27.041 --> 22:28.303
Okay, fine.

22:30.523 --> 22:32.046
Just catching up
with an old friend.

22:33.047 --> 22:34.091
We're all good here.

22:39.706 --> 22:42.230
I got it from a woman
named Qyeala. But you already
knew that.

22:43.927 --> 22:44.885
She's dead.

22:47.104 --> 22:50.586
Before you break my nose again,
I'm not the one who killed her.

22:50.630 --> 22:53.328
A few years ago, I was
on a planet far from here.

22:54.460 --> 22:55.722
A conflict broke out.

22:56.897 --> 22:58.899
Ugly thing no one saw coming.

22:58.942 --> 23:01.510
I don't know why,
but she was there too.

23:01.554 --> 23:03.294
Both of us
got pinned down and...

23:09.910 --> 23:12.391
I took this ring
to remind myself

23:12.434 --> 23:14.175
that it could've been
me instead.

23:19.746 --> 23:21.443
We're done here.
Get out of my way.

23:28.842 --> 23:33.063
Next time,
we're having Italian.
The chicken tasted like rubber.

23:33.107 --> 23:35.283
Have you eaten a lot of rubber?

24:05.052 --> 24:07.141
What the hell
are you doing here?

24:07.184 --> 24:08.577
It's time for us to talk.

24:08.621 --> 24:12.189
You broke into our home.
We could have you arrested.

24:12.233 --> 24:14.453
You could.

24:14.496 --> 24:17.325
I wonder what I would tell
the police about your daughter.

24:18.413 --> 24:19.849
You've been following us.

24:21.198 --> 24:22.461
Things are changing.

24:23.636 --> 24:24.811
Getting more dangerous.

24:26.987 --> 24:30.512
I know that the military
has been investigating
people like me.

24:30.556 --> 24:32.645
- Why are you here?
- To warn you.

24:33.559 --> 24:35.343
Someone is coming for Naomi.

24:36.170 --> 24:38.041
He knows where she is now.

24:38.085 --> 24:39.390
What are you talking about?

24:39.434 --> 24:42.481
Naomi's presence in Port Oswego
is untenable.

24:43.830 --> 24:45.701
Staying here
puts her in danger.

24:45.745 --> 24:47.007
It puts you in danger.

24:48.182 --> 24:51.315
It puts me in danger.

24:51.359 --> 24:53.274
- We can protect her.
- Can you?

24:54.884 --> 24:56.364
It's time to leave.

24:56.407 --> 24:58.235
It's not safe here
for any of us.

24:58.279 --> 24:59.715
Then maybe you should leave.

25:01.282 --> 25:02.892
That won't change anything.

25:04.024 --> 25:06.505
They won't stop
until they find her.

25:06.548 --> 25:08.115
We don't answer to you.

25:20.431 --> 25:21.911
I'm not asking you.

25:22.608 --> 25:24.435
I'm telling you.

25:24.479 --> 25:27.787
Deal with this situation.
Or I will.

26:02.778 --> 26:05.520
The location of
your home planet
is inconclusive.

26:08.479 --> 26:10.090
There's got to be something
you can tell me.

26:13.180 --> 26:17.445
Have you heard of
the many worlds theory
of quantum mechanics?

26:17.488 --> 26:20.100
Yeah, the idea that there are
multiple universes,

26:20.143 --> 26:22.276
all existing at the same time
in the same space.

26:22.319 --> 26:24.234
It's not just a theory.

26:24.278 --> 26:27.107
Others refer to this
as "the multiverse."

26:27.150 --> 26:28.978
But that would mean I am not
from a different planet.

26:29.022 --> 26:30.632
I'm from a different universe?

26:30.676 --> 26:32.982
Yes. That's why I can't
pinpoint where you're from.

26:33.026 --> 26:35.550
It's a problem of both
complexity and scale.

26:40.207 --> 26:41.512
So I'm right back
where I started.

26:44.646 --> 26:47.127
There has to be something else
you can tell me.

26:47.170 --> 26:50.173
Like some kind of fringe theory
or out-of-the-box
experiment.

26:50.217 --> 26:51.740
These matters are sensitive.

26:51.784 --> 26:53.916
Dr. Bell, up until
a few weeks ago,

26:53.960 --> 26:57.311
I was a normal girl
living a normal life.

26:57.354 --> 26:59.226
And the Superman came
and everything, it just...

27:00.401 --> 27:02.098
It changed.

27:02.142 --> 27:04.971
I found out I have powers.
And that I'm from
a different world.

27:06.581 --> 27:09.758
That I'm from a world
I've never seen.

27:09.802 --> 27:13.370
Wherever I'm from,
wherever my real home is,
I have to find it.

27:14.676 --> 27:15.503
Please.

27:19.376 --> 27:21.814
I have been working
on a prototype.

27:21.857 --> 27:24.817
A fission device that acts
as an elevated energy source.

27:24.860 --> 27:27.515
It might be able to pinpoint
where you're from.

27:27.558 --> 27:29.865
- But it was stolen.
- Stolen?

27:30.736 --> 27:31.954
By who?

27:31.998 --> 27:34.653
By someone very dangerous
and very powerful.

27:35.741 --> 27:36.742
Someone like you.

27:56.457 --> 27:58.981
So, where does she keep
the keys to the security room?

27:59.025 --> 28:00.374
Desk. Top left drawer.

28:02.593 --> 28:03.420
Oh.

28:06.772 --> 28:08.599
Mrs. Varady, hi.

28:08.643 --> 28:09.862
Did you need
something, Anthony?

28:10.732 --> 28:13.692
Yes. I uh...

28:13.735 --> 28:16.999
I was just making sure
that you'd be at Homecoming.

28:17.043 --> 28:21.700
I've been attending
since I was a student.
No reason to stop now.

28:21.743 --> 28:23.789
It, uh, would not be
the same without you.

28:25.616 --> 28:28.968
I'd really like
to get into my office please.

28:30.926 --> 28:32.449
Of course.

28:36.236 --> 28:38.542
Nathan. What are you doing?

28:38.586 --> 28:40.457
Uh, looks like
you're busted, Nathan.

28:43.591 --> 28:46.550
I was just telling Nathan
how much you love Homecoming,

28:46.594 --> 28:50.250
and, uh, he wanted
to give you some
front row seats to the game.

28:52.078 --> 28:54.602
I was just leaving you a note.

28:54.645 --> 28:56.909
Thank you.
That was very thoughtful.

28:59.433 --> 29:01.740
I should really
get back to work.

29:01.783 --> 29:03.698
Of course.

29:05.091 --> 29:06.614
See you at the game.

29:17.320 --> 29:18.626
Where'd you
learn to do all of this?

29:19.975 --> 29:20.846
Seoul.

29:24.850 --> 29:26.416
I didn't know anyone
at my school,

29:26.460 --> 29:29.637
so I spent most of my time
teaching myself this stuff.

29:31.291 --> 29:32.335
Was it hard...

29:33.815 --> 29:34.947
always moving around?

29:37.514 --> 29:39.168
Sometimes. Yeah.

29:41.475 --> 29:42.302
Found it.

29:48.656 --> 29:50.527
What... Is that...

29:51.137 --> 29:52.181
Esme?

29:59.145 --> 30:00.363
Maybe Lux is lying.

30:04.150 --> 30:05.064
He's not.

30:09.242 --> 30:10.721
If Q is still out there,

30:11.766 --> 30:13.159
she would have found
her way to me.

30:15.857 --> 30:18.077
The list must have been
some kind of a decoy.

30:20.688 --> 30:22.342
At least now you can
finally leave.

30:26.607 --> 30:28.304
Leave?

30:28.348 --> 30:31.830
Without Q,
there's nothing keeping you
in Port Oswego, right?

30:36.356 --> 30:37.792
We've got trouble.

31:00.902 --> 31:04.297
If I apologize,
can we avoid all this?

31:08.083 --> 31:09.041
Hey.

31:10.825 --> 31:11.913
You know the rules.

31:13.393 --> 31:14.742
Human skills only.

32:01.354 --> 32:02.181
Time to go.

32:06.663 --> 32:08.317
You promised you'd do this.

32:08.361 --> 32:11.059
I promised to do this
if it meant you
winning that trophy.

32:11.103 --> 32:13.235
- I still can.
- You're too far behind.

32:13.279 --> 32:15.455
I'm sorry, honey,
I can't take a pie
in the face for nothing.

32:16.108 --> 32:17.109
There's always next year.

32:24.290 --> 32:25.291
What do you two want?

32:27.641 --> 32:30.992
We just came
to see if we could
buy one of those pies.

32:34.822 --> 32:35.954
Got any peanut butter?

32:39.479 --> 32:41.263
Sure.

32:41.307 --> 32:42.525
Yeah, I have peanut butter.

33:05.331 --> 33:06.680
Why did you do that?

33:06.723 --> 33:07.986
I need to talk.

33:08.899 --> 33:10.162
Now you want to talk?

33:11.163 --> 33:12.207
You're frustrated.

33:16.037 --> 33:17.386
Why are you doing this?

33:18.779 --> 33:20.476
Why won't you just
tell me the truth?

33:20.520 --> 33:22.217
Because you're not
ready, Naomi.

33:22.261 --> 33:23.349
Ready for what?

33:25.090 --> 33:26.743
I know exactly who you are.

33:27.918 --> 33:29.268
I know what you did
to our planet.

33:30.878 --> 33:31.922
Do you?

33:33.881 --> 33:36.797
Ever since I moved here,
my parents have
warned me about you.

33:38.538 --> 33:40.844
Now I understand why.

33:40.888 --> 33:42.890
It's because
you're not a good person.

33:45.632 --> 33:48.069
Stay away from STAR Labs.

33:48.113 --> 33:49.679
That's what I came to tell you.

33:49.723 --> 33:50.898
You were following me?

33:54.815 --> 33:56.295
I know you stole that device.

33:58.123 --> 33:59.037
You know nothing.

34:00.734 --> 34:02.040
But ignorance is one thing.

34:03.389 --> 34:04.651
Immaturity is another.

34:06.566 --> 34:08.568
You've proven to me
time and time again

34:08.611 --> 34:10.613
that you aren't ready
for any of this.

34:10.657 --> 34:13.225
That you're not willing
to think for yourself.

34:13.268 --> 34:15.227
To ask yourself
the hard questions.

34:16.663 --> 34:17.751
You're wrong about me.

34:22.973 --> 34:24.410
STAR Labs is dangerous.

34:25.106 --> 34:26.977
Dr. Bell is dangerous.

34:27.021 --> 34:29.502
The device is dangerous.

34:30.764 --> 34:32.026
That's why I took it.

34:33.027 --> 34:34.289
It'll ruin our planet.

34:35.160 --> 34:36.291
I don't believe you.

34:39.120 --> 34:40.165
That's irrelevant.

34:42.123 --> 34:44.647
If you're not going
to give me the device,

34:45.779 --> 34:47.607
I'm going to take it from you.

34:49.522 --> 34:52.960
Finally, some nerve.

35:29.344 --> 35:30.998
You're such a disappointment.

35:46.056 --> 35:47.319
Hey, hang on a sec, Pumpkin.

35:50.191 --> 35:51.279
What's going on.

35:51.323 --> 35:52.498
We got you something.

36:00.027 --> 36:02.899
We started this
a long time ago.

36:02.943 --> 36:04.510
And we think it's time
for you to have it.

36:15.869 --> 36:17.479
I remember this place.

36:17.523 --> 36:18.654
It had the best candy.

36:20.482 --> 36:22.745
I think we went
to that store every
single day we lived there.

36:26.096 --> 36:28.011
My first Superman comic.

36:28.055 --> 36:30.231
I still have it.

36:30.275 --> 36:33.539
You know,
I know with our lifestyle,
all the moving around,

36:35.149 --> 36:38.065
it can be hard
to ever feel settled.
Like you belong.

36:40.067 --> 36:42.461
We wanted you
to have a reminder
of the good times, too.

36:47.466 --> 36:49.903
I love you so much.
Thank you, guys.

36:49.946 --> 36:51.252
We love you too, Pumpkin.

You said you had answers?

38:33.180 --> 38:34.312
I certainly do.

38:42.668 --> 38:46.889
I tried to get
your device back,
but Zumbado stopped me.

38:46.933 --> 38:48.151
It's all right.

38:48.195 --> 38:49.501
I was able to find
another source of energy.

38:49.544 --> 38:52.721
One much more powerful,
much more unique.

38:52.765 --> 38:55.376
I believe I'm on the cusp
of unlocking a secret...

38:55.420 --> 38:58.945
the ability to see
and move across dimensions.

39:00.250 --> 39:02.078
You might be able to tell me
where I come from?

39:03.384 --> 39:05.168
I'm afraid
it's not that simple.

39:05.212 --> 39:07.954
The purpose of my work
is greater than
any individual pursuit.

39:09.608 --> 39:10.870
It requires sacrifice.

39:15.527 --> 39:16.615
Where did you get that?

39:18.399 --> 39:20.270
I thought that was the energy
source that I needed.

39:21.446 --> 39:23.535
But I found one
that is much more powerful.

39:35.416 --> 39:37.766
Please, I ju--
I just want to go.

39:37.810 --> 39:40.900
I had heard rumors about
powers like yours existing.

39:40.943 --> 39:42.554
But it's greater than
I could have imagined.

39:43.990 --> 39:45.644
I am sorry for this next part.

39:53.478 --> 39:54.566
Please stop.
