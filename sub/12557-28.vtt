<i>[theme music playing]</i>

00:09.176 --> 00:12.214
<i>(narrator) YOU'RE TRA VEL ING'
THROUGH ANOTHER DIMENSION--</i>

00:12.304 --> 00:15.513
<i>A DIMENSION NOT ONLY OF SIGHT
AND SOUND, BUT OF MIND,</i>

00:15.557 --> 00:17.298
<i>A JOURNEY INTO
A WONDROUS LAND</i>

00:17.392 --> 00:19.520
<i>WHOSE BOUNDARIES
ARE THAT OF IMAGINATION.</i>

00:19.603 --> 00:22.516
<i>YOUR NEXT STOP,
THE TWILIGHT</i> ZONE.

00:34.576 --> 00:37.489
( <i>Clanking</i> )

00:47.631 --> 00:49.668
WELL, HOW
DID YOU DO?

00:49.758 --> 00:51.840
IT'S REPAIRABLE.

00:51.927 --> 00:54.635
BUT I WON'T BE ABLE TO TOUCH
ANY OF THOSE GIMBAL BEARINGS

00:54.721 --> 00:56.098
UNTIL THEY COOL OFF.

00:56.181 --> 00:57.558
IT'S LIKE A FURNACE
IN THERE NOW.

00:57.641 --> 00:59.427
[sighs]

00:59.518 --> 01:02.727
AND THAT GRAND MOMENT
VVILL COME VVHEN?

01:02.813 --> 01:04.474
MAYBE TOMORROW NIGHT...

01:04.565 --> 01:06.397
THE FOLLOWING MORNING.

01:06.483 --> 01:08.144
[chuckles]

01:08.235 --> 01:11.273
THAT'S A SVVIG FROM THE
OLD BOTTLE, ISN'T IT?

01:11.363 --> 01:15.573
OH, YOU SURE PICKED A NICE
PLACE TO SET DOVVN, FLETCHER--

01:15.659 --> 01:17.570
THE FLOOR
OF A CANYON.

01:17.661 --> 01:20.619
I TOOK YOU TO THE FIRST MASS
OF LAND THAT LOOMED UP.

01:20.706 --> 01:22.697
AND JUST FOR THE RECORD, MR.
CRAIG,

01:22.791 --> 01:25.624
I DIDN'T PEPPER THE NOSE OF THAT
VEHICLE VVITH METEOR HOLES.

01:25.711 --> 01:27.793
I ALSO DIDN'T FOUL UP
THOSE ROCKET BOOSTERS.

01:27.879 --> 01:29.916
THAT'S SOMETHING YOU CAN
CHALK UP TO NATURE.

01:30.007 --> 01:31.998
ALL RIGHT,
ALL RIGHT.

01:32.092 --> 01:36.086
IT JUST STRIKES ME AS KIND OF A
DEADHEAD PLACE TO SET DOVVN-

01:36.179 --> 01:40.389
ON THE FLOOR
OF A CANYON.

01:40.475 --> 01:45.436
"FOOD CONCENTRATE, COMMA,
ABLE-1-6-3, COMMA--

01:45.522 --> 01:49.937
MODIFIED DINNER PLAN."

01:50.027 --> 01:51.609
WHOEVER INVENTED
THIS STUFF

01:51.695 --> 01:53.606
MUST HAVE HAD
STOMACH TROUBLE.

01:53.655 --> 01:55.191
A VERY
BITTER CHARACTER

01:55.282 --> 01:57.694
WITH NO COMPASSION
FOR HIS FELLOW MEN--

01:57.784 --> 02:01.402
OR THEIR STOMACHS.

02:01.496 --> 02:03.749
OH, THERE MAY COME
A MOMENT IN TIME

02:03.832 --> 02:07.416
WHEN I'LL ENJOY THIS.

02:07.502 --> 02:10.163
THERE MAY COME A MOMENT
WHEN YOU'LL LICK A ROCK

02:10.255 --> 02:12.792
AS IF IT WERE A DRUMSTICK
OF A THANKSGIVING TURKEY,

02:12.841 --> 02:14.343
BUT FOR THE TIME
BEING, BUDDY,

02:14.426 --> 02:16.292
YOU'LL EAT WHAT
IS PRESCRIBED TO EAT!

02:16.345 --> 02:18.882
IF YOU'VE GOT ANY SET
OF DEEP-ROOTED COMPLAINTS,

02:18.972 --> 02:20.633
YOU PUT THEM DOWN
IN A LEDGER;

02:20.682 --> 02:22.639
DON'T SPRAY THEM
ALL OVER ME!

02:22.726 --> 02:24.387
IT'S A WASTE
OF EFFORT.

02:24.478 --> 02:26.640
IT'S ALSO DULL, AND IT'S
TOUGH TO Ll\/E VVITH.

02:26.688 --> 02:28.190
YOU READ ME, CRAIG?

02:28.273 --> 02:29.559
LOUD AND CLEAR.

02:29.650 --> 02:31.482
THEN DWELL ON IT!

02:31.568 --> 02:33.434
AND WHILE
YOU'RE DWELLING ON IT

02:33.528 --> 02:35.485
YOU MIGHT COUNT
A FEW BLESSINGS.

02:35.572 --> 02:37.483
WE DON'T HAVE
MUCH FOOD OR WATER,

02:37.574 --> 02:39.815
BUT WE LANDED IN A PLACE
WHERE THERE'S OXYGEN

02:39.868 --> 02:40.983
AND WE CAN SURVIVE.

02:41.078 --> 02:42.489
WE WALKED AWAY FROM IT

02:42.579 --> 02:44.195
WITHOUT A SINGLE BONE
OUT OF PLACE.

02:44.289 --> 02:45.996
THE STANDING ORDER
IS AS FOLLOWS:

02:46.083 --> 02:48.324
YOU GOT TEARS TO SHED,
SAVE THEM FOR NIGHT

02:48.418 --> 02:50.000
AND WEEP THEM
INTO YOUR PILLOW.

02:50.087 --> 02:51.498
DON'T BOTHER ME
WITH THEM!

02:51.588 --> 02:53.499
NOW HOW DO
YOU READ ME?

02:53.590 --> 03:00.212
STILL LOUD AND
CLEAR, COMMANDER.

03:00.305 --> 03:01.682
BUT THERE ARE TIMES

03:01.723 --> 03:03.964
WHEN A MAN GETS
SICK TO DEATH

03:04.059 --> 03:06.551
OF BEING LED AROUND
BY THE NOSE.

03:06.645 --> 03:10.684
THAT'S A BIG THING WITH
YOU, ISN'T IT, CRAIG?

03:10.774 --> 03:11.730
WHAT IS?

03:11.817 --> 03:13.353
TAKING ORDERS,

03:13.443 --> 03:15.559
BEING ON THE RECEIVING
END OF A COMMAND.

03:15.654 --> 03:21.024
IT'S HARD FOR YOU TO
LIVE WITH, ISN'T IT?

03:21.118 --> 03:22.529
IF I HAD MY DRUTHERS,

03:22.619 --> 03:24.360
I MIGHT STICK IN
A FEW CHANGES.

03:24.454 --> 03:25.615
HMM, LIKE WHAT?

03:25.706 --> 03:27.196
SAY AGAIN?

03:27.290 --> 03:29.372
I MEAN, BEYOND US
GETTING OUT OF HERE.

03:29.459 --> 03:31.746
LET'S SAY THIS IS
THE END OF THE LINE.

03:31.837 --> 03:34.078
NOW, HOW WOULD YOU
SWEETEN THE POT?

03:34.172 --> 03:36.209
A SIRLOIN STEAK,
A BLONDE, WHAT?

03:36.299 --> 03:38.677
HOW ABOUT
MUMBLETYPEG, FLETCHER?

03:38.760 --> 03:40.171
OR MAYBE 2O QUESTIONS?

03:40.262 --> 03:42.048
LOOK, TRY ME
AFTER DINNER...

03:42.139 --> 03:43.880
I MAY FEEL UP
TO CHARADES.

03:43.974 --> 03:46.181
POINT OF INTEREST
IS ALL.

03:46.268 --> 03:50.057
I'M JUST INTERESTED IN
VVHAT MAKES YOU TICK.

03:50.147 --> 03:54.061
OR MAYBE IT'S VVHAT MAKES
YOU TICK SO LOUDLY.

03:54.151 --> 03:56.313
WHAT DO YOU HUNGER
FOR MOST, CRAIG?

04:05.996 --> 04:08.579
TRY THIS ONE, FLETCH...

04:08.665 --> 04:12.533
I'D LIKE A WHOLE LOT
OF PEOPLE AT MY ELBOW:

04:12.627 --> 04:14.584
THE MORE THE MERRIER,

04:14.671 --> 04:16.833
THE LOUDER THE BETTER,

04:16.923 --> 04:21.793
AND I'D LIKE YANKEE
STADIUM RIGHT ALONGSIDE.

04:21.887 --> 04:23.924
BUT I'D LIKE
THEM ON MY TERMS.

04:24.014 --> 04:26.756
THAT'S WHAT
I'M GETTING AT.

04:26.850 --> 04:28.716
WHAT ARE "YOUR" TERMS?

04:28.810 --> 04:33.429
I'D LIKE TO BE THE
NUMBER ONE STRAVV BOSS.

04:33.523 --> 04:36.766
I'D LIKE TO
GIVE THE ORDERS.

04:36.860 --> 04:38.476
UH-HUH...

04:38.570 --> 04:40.106
I'LL BET YOU WOULD.

04:45.494 --> 04:48.077
[faint noise]

05:01.384 --> 05:05.298
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

05:05.388 --> 05:08.426
WHAT'S THE
MATTER WITH YOU?

05:08.517 --> 05:11.134
DID YOU HEAR THAT?

05:11.228 --> 05:12.810
HEAR WHAT?

05:12.896 --> 05:14.512
<i>THAT SOUND.</i>

05:14.606 --> 05:15.892
WHAT SOUND?

05:15.982 --> 05:17.939
FLETCH, I
HEARD SOMETHING...

05:18.026 --> 05:19.812
I... I HEARD A SOUND...

05:19.861 --> 05:21.898
A SOUND LIKE... LIKE...

05:21.988 --> 05:23.695
<i>[faint noise]</i>

05:23.782 --> 05:28.652
A SOUND
LIKE WHAT?

05:28.745 --> 05:31.908
VOICES.

05:31.998 --> 05:35.866
PEOPLE.

05:35.961 --> 05:37.872
THE TIME IS THE SPACE AGE.

05:37.963 --> 05:41.001
THE PLACE IS A BARREN LANDSCAPE
OF A RCCK-VVALLED CANYON

05:41.091 --> 05:44.209
THAT LIES MILLIONS OF MILES
FROM THE PLANET EARTH.

05:44.302 --> 05:46.839
THE CAST OF CHARACTERS?
YOU'VE MET THEM--

05:46.930 --> 05:49.513
WILLIAM FLETCHER,
COMMANDER OF THE SPACESHIP;

05:49.599 --> 05:51.681
HIS COPILOT, PETER CRAIG.

05:51.768 --> 05:54.977
THE OTHER CHARACTERS VVHC INHABIT
THIS PLACE YOU MAY NE\/ER SEE,

05:55.063 --> 05:56.645
BUT THEY'RE THERE,

05:56.731 --> 05:58.642
AS THESE TWO GENTLEMEN
WILL SOON FIND OUT.

05:58.733 --> 06:01.646
BECAUSE THEY'RE ABOUT TO PARTAKE
IN A LITTLE EXPLORATION

06:01.736 --> 06:05.570
INTO THAT GRAY, SHADED
AREA IN SPACE AND TIME-

06:05.657 --> 06:07.864
<i>THAT'S KNOWN
AS THE TWILIGHT ZONE.</i>

06:27.470 --> 06:30.713
WELL, WHERE HAS
MY WANDERING BOY BEEN

06:30.807 --> 06:32.172
MOST OF THE DAY?

06:32.267 --> 06:36.932
YOU TAKE A LOT
OF WALKS, BUDDY.

06:37.022 --> 06:40.185
SOMETHING BETTER TO DO?

06:40.275 --> 06:41.982
YEAH, THERE IS.

06:42.068 --> 06:44.901
LIKE, UH, CHECKING
OVERA RADIO,

06:44.988 --> 06:47.355
LIKE LOOKING OVER
A HYDRAULIC SYSTEM,

06:47.449 --> 06:49.986
A PROPULSION SYSTEM,
AN EJECTION SYSTEM,

06:50.076 --> 06:51.362
A THRUST CHAMBER.

06:51.453 --> 06:53.615
YEAH, THERE ARE
A FEW THINGS.

06:53.705 --> 06:58.120
VVHERE ARE YOU SPENDING MOST
OF YOUR TIME THESE DAYS?

06:58.209 --> 07:01.122
<i>STILL HEARING
YOUR VOICES?</i>

07:01.212 --> 07:02.919
MAYBE.

07:03.006 --> 07:05.213
I THINK IT VVOULD BE AN
EXCEPTIONALLY GOOD IDEA

07:05.300 --> 07:09.134
IF YOU'D GET TO WORK
ON THOSE CHARTS AGAIN.

07:09.220 --> 07:10.381
[sighs]

07:27.238 --> 07:28.740
IT'S HOT, ISN'T IT?

07:28.823 --> 07:31.656
PASSABLE.

07:31.743 --> 07:35.737
YOU SOME KIND
OF A CAMEL, CRAIG?

07:35.830 --> 07:37.741
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

07:37.832 --> 07:39.960
IT JUST OCCURS TO ME I HAVEN'T
SEEN YOU TAKE ANY VVATER.

07:40.001 --> 07:42.117
WELL, UH...

07:42.212 --> 07:45.295
I'M A WHISKEY MAN MYSELF,
OR HADN'T YOU NOTICED?

07:45.382 --> 07:50.968
UH-UH. YOU'RE GONNA HA\/E
TO DO BETTER THAN THAT.

07:51.054 --> 07:53.762
ALL RIGHT, WHAT
GIVES, CRAIG?

07:53.848 --> 07:54.974
S-SAY AGAIN?

07:55.058 --> 07:56.674
YOUR EARS
DON'T LAP.

07:56.768 --> 07:59.135
YOUR WATER HASN'T BEEN
TOUCHED IN 24 HOURS.

07:59.229 --> 08:01.266
NOW, YOU COULDN'T
HAVE DISCOVERED

08:01.356 --> 08:03.063
ANY MOUNTAIN
STREAM UP THERE

08:03.149 --> 08:05.231
AND KEPT IT ALL FOR YOUR
LONESOME, COULD YOU?

08:05.318 --> 08:07.025
WHY DON'T YOU
TALK SENSE--?

08:07.112 --> 08:08.273
WHY DON'T YOU?!

08:08.363 --> 08:10.149
FOR THE LAST
TWO DAYS

08:10.240 --> 08:11.901
YOU'VE BEEN TAKING OFF ON
YOUR OVVN PRIVATE SAFARI

08:11.992 --> 08:14.529
EVERY MORNING VVHEN THAT
DOUBLE SUN COMES UP.

08:14.619 --> 08:16.360
WHERE DO
YOU GO, CRAIG,

08:16.454 --> 08:18.912
AND VVHAT DO YOU FIND
VVHEREVER IT IS YOU DO GO?

08:18.999 --> 08:20.660
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT...

08:20.750 --> 08:23.913
LET'S YOU AND ME MAKE
THAT TREK TOGETHER, HUH?

08:24.004 --> 08:27.668
THANKS, BUT NO THANKS.

08:27.716 --> 08:29.172
I'M TIRED.

08:29.259 --> 08:30.249
LOOK, CRAIG--

08:30.343 --> 08:31.333
[thud]

08:39.436 --> 08:40.926
WHERE'D YOU
FIND THIS?

08:41.020 --> 08:42.977
UH, I--|--|
TOLD YOU--

08:43.063 --> 08:47.524
I'VE BEEN
LOOKING AROUND.

08:47.610 --> 08:49.521
IT'S WET.

08:49.612 --> 08:51.944
YOU FOUND WATER,
DIDN'T YOU?

08:52.032 --> 08:54.364
WHERE?

08:54.451 --> 08:55.907
ABOUT A MILE
UP AHEAD...

08:55.994 --> 08:57.530
IT'S JUST A CRUMMY
LITTLE STREAM...

08:57.620 --> 09:00.157
BUT ENOUGH FOR YOU
TO DRINK OUT OF!

09:00.248 --> 09:01.488
AW, COME ON, FLETCH,

09:01.583 --> 09:03.369
IWAS GONNA
SHOW IT TO YOU.

09:03.460 --> 09:06.077
AS A MATTER OF FACT,
I'VE BEEN TESTING IT.

09:06.171 --> 09:09.163
I JUST FOUND OUT IT WAS
PURE A LITTLE BIT AGO.

09:09.257 --> 09:11.419
YOU KNOW, I
UNDERRATED YOU, MISTER.

09:11.509 --> 09:13.887
I KNEW YOU WERE
A GROUSING MALCONTENT,

09:13.970 --> 09:16.007
BUT I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU WERE A CHEAT!

09:24.397 --> 09:27.185
<i>IT'S JUST A VARIETY OF LICHEN--</i>

09:27.275 --> 09:28.982
YOU DON'T MIND
IF I LOOK AT IT

09:29.069 --> 09:31.106
THROUGH THE
MAGNIFIER, DO YOU?

09:31.196 --> 09:32.982
OR HAVE YOU DONE
THAT ALREADY?

09:56.679 --> 09:58.090
TREES.

09:58.181 --> 10:03.017
YES, THAT'S WHAT
THEY ARE...TREES.

10:03.103 --> 10:06.186
I MIGHT AS WELL GO
THE WHOLE ROUTE NOW.

10:06.272 --> 10:09.481
THEY WERE ALONGSIDE
OF A STREAM...

10:09.567 --> 10:13.435
IT RUNS ABOUT 100 FEET.

10:13.530 --> 10:16.113
<i>IT'S ABOUT TWO AND A
HALF INCHES WIDE.</i>

10:16.157 --> 10:18.865
IF YOU THINK
THAT'S SOMETHING...

10:18.952 --> 10:20.283
LOOK AT THIS.

10:26.876 --> 10:28.867
<i>(Craig)
LOOK AT IT!</i>

10:39.556 --> 10:42.093
THEN...

10:42.183 --> 10:44.470
THE VOICES?

10:44.561 --> 10:46.427
YOU WANT TO SEE
MORE, FLETCH?

10:46.521 --> 10:50.264
YEAH, YEAH,
I SURE DO.

10:50.358 --> 10:51.473
COME ON.

11:23.141 --> 11:26.475
<i>(Fletch)
IT'S FANTASTIC.</i>

11:26.561 --> 11:29.679
TO US, THAT STREAM
IS JUST A STREAM.

11:29.772 --> 11:33.515
THAT CLUMP OF LITTLE GREEN
VVEEDS IS SO MUCH MOSS.

11:33.610 --> 11:37.274
BUT THEY ARE TREES, AND
THAT STREAM IS A Rl\/ER,

11:37.363 --> 11:39.104
AND IF YOU
LOOK CLOSELY--

11:39.199 --> 11:40.655
<i>I MEAN,
REALLY CLOSE--</i>

11:40.742 --> 11:42.278
<i>YOU'LL SEE A
COUPLE OF ITEMS</i>

11:42.368 --> 11:44.109
<i>THAT AREN'T PAR
FOR THE COURSE.</i>

11:49.459 --> 11:52.201
IT'S INCREDIBLE.

11:52.253 --> 11:55.086
IT'S A VVHOLE RACE OF
PEOPLE NO BIGGER THAN ANTS.

11:55.173 --> 11:58.256
YEAH, A WHOLE
RACE OF PEOPLE.

11:58.343 --> 12:00.300
AND WHILE YOU WERE
PREOCCUPYING YOURSELF

12:00.386 --> 12:01.922
WITH GLUING
TOGETHER AN ENGINE,

12:02.013 --> 12:03.970
I WAS MAKING CONTACT.

12:04.057 --> 12:05.798
IN THEIR LANGUAGE?

12:05.892 --> 12:07.348
I DON'T KNOVV IT YET, AND
THEY DON'T KNOVV OURS,

12:07.435 --> 12:08.766
BUT THEY DO
KNOW MATHEMATICS.

12:08.853 --> 12:10.389
THAT'S THE LANGUAGE
I'VE USED--

12:10.480 --> 12:13.222
SYMBOLS, EQUATIONS,
NUMBER PROGRESSIONS.

12:13.316 --> 12:15.978
AND THEY'RE BRIGHT,
THEY LEARN FAST.

12:16.069 --> 12:17.776
AND COOPERATIVE, FLETCH!

12:17.862 --> 12:20.775
YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE HOVV
COOPERATIVE THEY ARE!

12:20.865 --> 12:22.822
I'VE TOLD THEM
ALL MY WANTS.

12:22.909 --> 12:25.196
THEY'VE SHOWN ME WHERE
THE EDIBLE PLANTS ARE.

12:25.286 --> 12:28.153
VVHY, LAST NIGHT, I THINKIATE
UP ONE OF THEIR FORESTS.

12:28.248 --> 12:29.738
WHAT ELSE DID
