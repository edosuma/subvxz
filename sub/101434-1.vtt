10:28.103 --> 10:30.739
Ah! Yes, yes,
you're absolutely right.

10:30.806 --> 10:32.174
How could we possibly understand

10:32.241 --> 10:33.842
such a sophisticated ritual?

10:33.910 --> 10:37.212
Hold the phone. Got a canine
near the animal hospital.

10:38.580 --> 10:40.549
[panting]

10:40.616 --> 10:43.519
Oh, I bet
he's planning something.

10:43.585 --> 10:46.522
- Just a stray.
- 'Looks suspicious to me.'

10:46.588 --> 10:50.192
Could be a serious plot
against feline patients.

10:50.259 --> 10:52.962
Ah! Not the diaper,
not the diaper!

10:53.028 --> 10:54.830
(Roger)
'And... the diaper.'

10:54.898 --> 10:56.498
Ugh! Oh!

10:56.565 --> 10:58.834
Oh, I'm gonna be sick.
Let me guess.

10:58.902 --> 11:01.103
Too complex
for my kind to grasp?

11:01.169 --> 11:03.605
Nope. That's just disgusting.

11:03.672 --> 11:04.640
[groans]

11:04.706 --> 11:07.609
Nothing exciting
ever happens anymore.

11:07.676 --> 11:09.177
You guys have all the fun.

11:09.244 --> 11:11.079
Take it from someone who knows

11:11.146 --> 11:12.414
there was nothing fun

11:12.481 --> 11:15.117
about those major plots
back in the day.

11:15.183 --> 11:17.719
Lot of good agents,
both dog and cat

11:17.786 --> 11:19.755
got injured, or worse.

11:19.821 --> 11:21.490
Oh, wait. You saw some action?

11:21.557 --> 11:23.026
Enough to know
it wasn't for me.

11:23.091 --> 11:24.593
At least you were out there.

11:24.660 --> 11:27.162
Hey! You ever
gave anyone the old..

11:27.229 --> 11:28.564
[swishing]

11:28.630 --> 11:30.232
[grunting]

11:30.299 --> 11:31.968
What the feline is that?

11:32.035 --> 11:33.869
[alarms blaring]

11:33.937 --> 11:36.940
- Initiate reboot protocol.
- Initiating.

11:37.006 --> 11:38.807
Probably a power failure.

11:38.874 --> 11:40.075
(Pablo on PA)
'In case you're wondering'

11:40.142 --> 11:41.843
'this is not a power failure.'

11:41.911 --> 11:43.345
'But <i>failure'</i>

11:43.412 --> 11:45.113
'is the perfect word
to describe'

11:45.180 --> 11:46.481
'what's just happened'

11:46.548 --> 11:49.052
'to your labyrinth
monitoring system.'

11:49.117 --> 11:51.286
'I've shut out
all communications'

11:51.353 --> 11:53.890
'from your headquarters
to every other station'

11:53.957 --> 11:55.223
'in your network.'

11:55.290 --> 11:58.760
'Just try and control
your FART now!'

11:58.827 --> 12:00.095
Well, dude, that was a thing.

12:00.162 --> 12:01.663
What's goin' on?
Who's doing this?

12:01.730 --> 12:04.033
(Pablo on PA) 'I am the
most nefarious villain'

12:04.099 --> 12:06.768
'the world has ever seen!'

12:06.835 --> 12:09.771
[laughing]

12:11.740 --> 12:12.774
Is that it? Is he done?

12:12.841 --> 12:14.109
This is not good!

12:14.176 --> 12:16.345
Honestly, I thought
the laugh was kind of weak.

12:16.411 --> 12:19.214
I'm thinking needy
with self-esteem issues.

12:19.281 --> 12:21.316
Probably a chihuahua or smaller.

12:21.383 --> 12:22.818
(Pablo on PA)
'I'm still here!'

12:22.885 --> 12:24.954
'I accidentally hit
the mute button.'

12:25.021 --> 12:27.689
'Just know that
as you sit there helplessly'

12:27.756 --> 12:30.626
'in your secret bunkers
all over the planet'

12:30.692 --> 12:33.462
'my brilliant plan
is already sending'

12:33.528 --> 12:36.765
'the world of dogs and cats
into chaos!'

12:36.832 --> 12:38.600
Chaos? What kind of chaos?

12:38.667 --> 12:39.635
[barking]

12:39.701 --> 12:40.736

(Roger) 'This is madness.
You don't get away with it.'

12:44.673 --> 12:46.876
(Pablo on PA)
'I already have.'

12:46.943 --> 12:49.879
[evil laughter]

12:51.246 --> 12:52.614
We gotta do something.

12:52.681 --> 12:54.583
You canines
designed this system.

12:54.650 --> 12:56.986
Tell me you butt-sniffers
have a backup plan.

12:57.053 --> 12:58.553
Uh..

12:58.620 --> 13:00.288
Oh, dear God. We're doomed.

13:02.290 --> 13:03.792
[traffic bustling]

13:05.761 --> 13:07.030
That's it, honey.

13:07.096 --> 13:08.830
(male #1)
'Let's go, Max.'

13:08.898 --> 13:10.066
That's it, kiddo.

13:10.133 --> 13:11.968
'Follow through.'

13:12.035 --> 13:13.468
Force him to use your back hand.

13:13.535 --> 13:15.470
Forehand, Max, forehand.

13:19.142 --> 13:21.010
Nice swing.

13:21.077 --> 13:22.045
[blows whistle]

13:22.111 --> 13:23.679
Power shot, power shot!

13:23.745 --> 13:26.581
All eyes will be on the State
Tennis Tournament next week

13:26.648 --> 13:28.817
as the boys gun
for the championship.

13:28.885 --> 13:30.887
Led by local phenom

13:30.953 --> 13:32.989
Max Harper.

13:33.056 --> 13:36.059
'Max will try to complete
an undefeated regular season'

13:36.125 --> 13:37.492
against Central High tomorrow

13:37.559 --> 13:40.629
as a tune-up before
the State championships.

13:40.696 --> 13:43.066
Follow through!
Pull over your shoulder.

13:43.132 --> 13:44.800
Susan!

13:44.866 --> 13:46.802
You know how I feel about you
coaching during practice.

13:46.868 --> 13:49.371
- I'm the coach.
- I've got the hat.

13:49.438 --> 13:51.473
You ordered that hat
off the internet.

13:51.540 --> 13:53.375
I'm gonna have to ask
for the whistle too.

13:55.477 --> 13:57.779
But, ya-uh, I'm keeping the hat.

14:00.016 --> 14:02.952

[Max grunts]

14:11.827 --> 14:12.995
Hey, honey.

14:19.001 --> 14:21.570
The biggest problem with FART,
besides the obvious

14:21.636 --> 14:23.305
is that it was designed by dogs!

14:23.371 --> 14:25.141
We never would have needed FART

14:25.208 --> 14:27.409
if you cats
weren't always plotting

14:27.476 --> 14:29.411
and scheming
and trying to disrupt

14:29.478 --> 14:30.712
nature's intentions.

14:30.779 --> 14:32.215
Nature's intentions?

14:32.280 --> 14:33.582
Three words, hair ball.

14:33.648 --> 14:36.651
"Man's best friend." Period.

14:36.718 --> 14:38.921
That's four words. Catnap!

14:39.956 --> 14:42.892
[snoring]

14:44.626 --> 14:46.428
Whoa! Where were we?

14:46.495 --> 14:48.998
[telephone ringing]

15:00.442 --> 15:03.012
Whoa! What is it?

15:04.613 --> 15:07.349
[telephone ringing]

15:17.592 --> 15:20.062
What are you doing?
That thing may be about to blow.

15:21.898 --> 15:22.965
Why did you do that for?

15:23.032 --> 15:24.833
- Sorry. Couldn't help myself.
- 'Hello.'

15:24.901 --> 15:26.334
- 'Hello? Pick up the phone.'
- Hey, wait.

15:26.401 --> 15:28.837
- 'Is anyone there?'
- I think it's talking.

15:28.905 --> 15:31.107
(Schnauzer on phone) 'Answer this
phone, you nincompoops!'

15:31.174 --> 15:33.341
- That sounds like the chief.
- 'It is the chief!'

15:33.408 --> 15:35.410
Whoa! How about that?
It's a phone!

15:35.477 --> 15:37.512
'High tech, no buttons.'

15:37.579 --> 15:38.881
(Schnauzer on phone)
'We've been hacked!'

15:38.948 --> 15:41.583
'Someone has shut down
our online systems.'

15:41.650 --> 15:44.419
'This old landline is the
only way we can communicate.'

15:44.486 --> 15:45.720
Who do you think is responsible?

15:45.787 --> 15:47.455
(Schnauzer on phone)
'We have no idea.'

15:47.522 --> 15:48.757
'But a crime like this has'

15:48.824 --> 15:50.625
'Mr. Tinkles and Kitty Galore'

15:50.692 --> 15:52.261
'written all over it.'

15:52.360 --> 15:53.963
Knew it. Always the cats.

15:54.030 --> 15:56.032
Watch who you're accusing,
mister!

15:56.098 --> 15:57.365
Or what?

15:57.432 --> 15:58.667
(Schnauzer on phone)
'Stop it, you two!'

15:58.733 --> 16:00.169
'It appears
they have done something'

16:00.236 --> 16:01.703
'that increases the hatred'

16:01.770 --> 16:04.307
'between cats
and dogs everywhere.'

16:04.372 --> 16:06.575
'It's clearly affecting
both of you already.'

16:06.641 --> 16:08.211
Not me. He started it!

16:08.277 --> 16:09.744
- Did not.
- Did too!

16:09.811 --> 16:13.082
(Schnauzer on phone) 'Enough!
Hit the big red button!'

'and passion flower.'

16:33.368 --> 16:35.104
Hmm. What do they do?

16:35.171 --> 16:37.472
(Schnauzer) 'They're still
in their beta phase.'

16:37.539 --> 16:38.941
'But if they work properly'

16:39.008 --> 16:41.344
'you should notice
your disdain for one another'

16:41.409 --> 16:42.577
'begin to wear off.'

16:42.644 --> 16:46.115
So, you want us
to be your test monkeys?

16:46.182 --> 16:47.482
- After you.
- No.

16:47.549 --> 16:49.018
- After <i>you.</i>
- No, no, no, no.

16:49.085 --> 16:51.519
- Doggies first.
- Oh, no, please.

16:51.586 --> 16:53.655
- After you.
- Rock, paper, scissors for it?

16:53.722 --> 16:56.791
You're on. One, two, three!

16:56.858 --> 16:58.560
- What is that?
- Is that a rock?

16:58.627 --> 17:00.428

'Ah! Just do it!'

17:03.398 --> 17:06.534
[instrumental music]

17:09.604 --> 17:12.340
I owe you an apology.

17:12.406 --> 17:14.442
Apology accepted.

17:14.509 --> 17:16.778
Ooh! Your coat is so soft.

17:16.845 --> 17:19.580
And your breath smells like
freshly mowed grass.

17:19.647 --> 17:22.684
(Schnauzer on phone) 'We haven't
studied any long term effects yet.'

17:22.751 --> 17:25.487

from killing each other'

'while you solve this case.'

17:27.890 --> 17:30.226

- 'Yes!'

(Schnauzer on phone) 'We may not
know who is behind this plot'

'they were able to pinpoint
the origin of the hack!'

17:38.901 --> 17:40.769
'It came from your zone.'

17:40.835 --> 17:42.371
'The perpetrator
we're looking for'

17:42.437 --> 17:44.472
'is within a five block radius'

17:44.539 --> 17:46.508
'of where you're sitting
right now!'

17:46.574 --> 17:47.809
Yes! We're on it, chief.

17:47.877 --> 17:50.079
W-w-wait a second.
We're not field agents.

17:50.146 --> 17:51.613
We're just monitors.

17:51.680 --> 17:53.481
Who are you sending
to take a lead on this?

17:53.548 --> 17:54.917
Who's in charge?

17:54.984 --> 17:57.320
(Schnauzer on phone)
'Bottom line, this starts'

a support team'

'We cannot trust outsiders.'

18:05.460 --> 18:07.330
From within this building?

18:07.396 --> 18:09.131
But there are only
a few other cats and dogs

18:09.198 --> 18:11.566
that live here and
none of them have any training.

it's up to you two to get them ready.'

with your song royalties.

We are okay, Zoey

18:50.406 --> 18:52.008
and we're gonna be okay, just..

...things have been a little
slow lately, that's all.

18:55.344 --> 18:56.644
I can help.

18:56.711 --> 18:59.115
I can get a job at the mall
or babysit.

No, no, no.
This is not your responsibility.

19:02.051 --> 19:04.652

The only thing is..

19:04.719 --> 19:06.588
...we may have to find
a smaller place.

19:06.654 --> 19:08.090
Or a bigger car

19:08.157 --> 19:09.724
with an actual backseat.

You mean, move again?

Well, just to save on rent.

But same neighborhood,
same school.

And pets, right?

30:02.078 --> 30:04.881
'and I am fully confident
this crew can find out.'

30:04.947 --> 30:06.415
This brand new, how do you do

30:06.481 --> 30:09.251
out of the blue,
cat and dog crew!

30:10.019 --> 30:11.820
Is she okay?

30:11.888 --> 30:13.923
She's just enthusiastic.

30:17.060 --> 30:19.761
(Gwen)
OMG! OMG!

30:19.828 --> 30:22.065
O-M to the G!

30:22.131 --> 30:23.732
This is really happening.

30:23.799 --> 30:26.401
I am outside!

30:26.468 --> 30:28.905
Yes, Seattle.
Outside and it's wet.

30:28.971 --> 30:31.406
It's so much more
than I ever thought it would be.

30:31.473 --> 30:33.910
It's, it's so big.

30:33.976 --> 30:36.278
We're only 20 feet away from
the front door of the building.

30:36.344 --> 30:38.213
There's actually a lot more.

30:38.280 --> 30:41.084
Oh! Look at all this space!

30:41.150 --> 30:42.718
'So much of space!'

30:44.319 --> 30:46.488
Too much space!
Where are all the walls?

30:46.555 --> 30:48.490
Danger!
Danger in every direction!

30:48.557 --> 30:50.692
Gwen, keep it together,
we've got a mission to do.

30:50.759 --> 30:53.795
- Let's just...
- 'Animal control, 5 o'clock!'

30:55.198 --> 30:56.966
(Gwen)
'Our eye in the sky.'

30:57.033 --> 30:59.634
And it's heading right at you.

30:59.701 --> 31:02.437
[dramatic music]

31:02.504 --> 31:04.873
- Scramble! Hide!
- Outside bad!

31:04.941 --> 31:07.676
Outside bad!
Whose idea was this?

31:15.550 --> 31:17.652
Oh, wait, wait, check that.

31:17.719 --> 31:19.922
'False alarm on
the animal control truck.'

31:19.989 --> 31:22.524
My bad.
Just the ice cream vendor.

31:22.591 --> 31:24.961
Uh, uh, think you can
get me a drumstick?

31:25.027 --> 31:26.996
[chuckles]
I just love those things.

31:27.063 --> 31:28.330
[sighs]

31:28.396 --> 31:31.500
[instrumental music]

31:43.880 --> 31:46.481
Before cameras and monitors
and gadgets

31:46.548 --> 31:49.018
we got our information
from combin' the streets.

31:49.085 --> 31:52.554
Like in a cop movie,
just gotta find us a snitch

31:52.621 --> 31:55.323
'a pigeon, a weasel,
a blabbermouth.'

31:55.390 --> 31:58.094
A cheese eater!
Oh! I think I see one.

31:58.161 --> 31:59.795
Cover me.

32:02.631 --> 32:04.200
[instrumental music]

32:04.267 --> 32:06.635
Okay, ankle bitter,
who's behind the plot?

32:06.701 --> 32:09.638
- Oh, boy!
- I'm on to you, cupcake.

32:09.704 --> 32:13.809
And don't think I'm fooled
by the whole Toy Group routine.

32:13.876 --> 32:15.410
Okay, a crafty one.

32:15.477 --> 32:18.780
Guess I need to dispense
with my good cop.

32:18.847 --> 32:21.516
Spill the beans, purse-pooch!

32:21.583 --> 32:24.187
Or you start losin' digits.

32:24.253 --> 32:25.720
[whimpering]

32:25.787 --> 32:27.990
Fingers or toes?

32:28.057 --> 32:29.424
[whimpering]

32:31.093 --> 32:32.360
You think it was too much?

32:32.427 --> 32:34.563
[siren wailing]

32:39.268 --> 32:42.271
Hey, sarge, FART agent 44871.

32:42.337 --> 32:43.605
What's the word on the street?

32:43.672 --> 32:45.407
Little small for an agent.

32:45.473 --> 32:47.310
I'm actually just a monitor.

32:47.375 --> 32:49.644
- Long story.
- Lot of domestic calls.

32:49.711 --> 32:51.546
Mostly cats and dogs
mixin' it up.

32:51.613 --> 32:54.083
Destroyin' property.
You got any leads?

32:54.150 --> 32:55.584
We narrowed it down to this zone

32:55.650 --> 32:58.087
but the perp took out
our comm, so..

32:58.154 --> 32:59.387
...we're hittin' the streets.

32:59.454 --> 33:02.591
Shaggy dog, in the park.
One of our informants.

33:02.657 --> 33:04.994
'Always has the 411.'

33:05.061 --> 33:06.428
[barks]

33:06.494 --> 33:08.630
Tell her Buck sent ya.

33:08.697 --> 33:11.901
Hey! Hey! Keep it off
the hydrants, buddy.

33:11.968 --> 33:14.303
(Buck)
'Hey, shampoodle, glace it up.'

33:14.369 --> 33:16.172
'Hey, buddy,
where's that collar?'

33:16.239 --> 33:18.040
Consider this a warning.

33:20.742 --> 33:24.746
Okay, executing covert approach.

33:24.813 --> 33:27.884
Gotta be cool, not too obvious.

33:27.950 --> 33:30.353
Oops, uh, comin' on too strong,
okay.

33:30.418 --> 33:32.121
Back it up, reset,
acting normal.

33:32.188 --> 33:33.956
Okay, not feeling normal.

33:34.023 --> 33:35.657
What do normal dogs do?

33:35.724 --> 33:37.960
They, they sniff trash cans.

33:38.027 --> 33:39.929
Commence sniffing.

33:39.996 --> 33:42.164
Ooh! Rotting chili dogs.

33:45.700 --> 33:48.104
Better get in on this.

33:48.170 --> 33:51.506
Hey, Shaggy, I hear you've got
a poopscoop around here.

33:51.573 --> 33:55.077
- I keep my eyes open.
- Uh, well..

33:55.144 --> 33:56.544
You see anything lately?

33:56.611 --> 33:58.713
Couple of weeks ago,
I heard whispers

33:58.780 --> 34:01.650
that someone was looking
to hire a job.

34:01.716 --> 34:04.619
A hush-hush kind of a job.

34:04.686 --> 34:06.688
- So, who was it?
- I don't know.

34:06.755 --> 34:08.123
They were right next to me

34:08.190 --> 34:10.824
and this may come
as a bit of a surprise

34:10.893 --> 34:12.395
I didn't see their faces.

34:12.460 --> 34:15.031
- Huh, imagine that.
- Ugh!

34:15.097 --> 34:18.533
Bottom line, if you need
something done around this town

34:18.600 --> 34:20.402
you go to the cats.

34:20.467 --> 34:23.105
- The cats?
- The alley cats.

34:23.172 --> 34:26.909
But they don't come out
till the sun goes down.

34:33.014 --> 34:35.150
[squeaking]

34:35.217 --> 34:39.554
(Pablo) 'When the world lays eyes on
me, they will cower in terror.'

34:39.621 --> 34:40.889
'They didn't think
I was worth loving'

34:40.956 --> 34:43.725
'so now,
they will fear me instead!'

34:44.960 --> 34:46.429
[all gasping]

34:46.494 --> 34:49.731
Oh, no, no, no. Hey, boss.

34:49.797 --> 34:51.533
[chuckling]
That ain't workin' for you.

34:51.599 --> 34:53.501
Really?
I thought hats were scary.

34:53.568 --> 34:57.872
- Um, not that one.
- Okay. Okay.

34:57.940 --> 35:02.178
Prepare to be scared
beyond your imagination.

35:02.244 --> 35:03.511
[croaking]

35:03.578 --> 35:06.715
[intense music]

35:11.253 --> 35:13.488
No! You don't look scared!

35:13.555 --> 35:16.591
- Of a wizard parrot?
- I'm a wizard cockatoo!

35:16.658 --> 35:19.028
Oh, well, now I'm scared!

35:19.095 --> 35:20.463
[slurping]

35:20.528 --> 35:22.764
We are getting reports
of global unrest

35:22.831 --> 35:24.799
developing in the pet world

35:24.866 --> 35:27.802
as canines and felines
are suddenly quarreling

35:27.869 --> 35:29.405
at unprecedented levels.

35:29.472 --> 35:33.142
Just take a look at these videos
sent in from our local viewers.

35:33.209 --> 35:35.945
[growling]

35:36.012 --> 35:38.014
'Wow!'

35:38.080 --> 35:40.316
Glad you're not involved
in any of that mess.

35:40.383 --> 35:41.350
Right, Gwen?

35:41.417 --> 35:42.918
You have no idea.

35:42.985 --> 35:46.055
Zero, zero, one,
four, nine, three.

35:46.122 --> 35:48.757
'Yeah, a 2:00 p.m. showing,
okay?'

35:48.823 --> 35:50.993
'I can confirm you?
Alright, thank you.'

35:51.060 --> 35:53.595
'Okay, I look forward to it.
Bye-bye.'

35:54.897 --> 35:55.998
How did it go, champ?

35:56.065 --> 35:58.733
- Six-three, six-three.
- Wow.

35:58.800 --> 36:01.270
You put up quite a fight today.

36:01.337 --> 36:03.105
Still, a win's a win.

36:04.974 --> 36:07.143
Yeah, um..

36:07.209 --> 36:10.179
Actually, I lost.

36:11.514 --> 36:14.283
- You lost?
- That's right.

36:14.350 --> 36:16.718
Okay, uh..

36:16.785 --> 36:19.321
We can just train
a little harder next time.

36:19.388 --> 36:21.023
You know, we've been taking
Sunday mornings off

36:21.090 --> 36:23.259
from practice,
maybe that was a mistake.

36:23.325 --> 36:25.693
I don't know, mom, it's just..

36:25.760 --> 36:28.130
Maybe I wasn't
feeling it today.

36:29.365 --> 36:30.933
Well, no fever.

36:31.000 --> 36:33.768
Good news is,
the team actually won.

36:33.835 --> 36:36.805
The other guys pulled it for me,
so we're still undefeated.

36:36.871 --> 36:40.209
Hm, well, that's a..

36:40.276 --> 36:42.411
...silver lining I guess.

36:42.478 --> 36:44.280
[chuckles]

36:44.346 --> 36:46.982
While it's not uncommon
to see behavioral changes

36:47.049 --> 36:49.885
coincide with mating seasons
or even..

36:49.952 --> 36:52.455
...weather patterns,
but we've never seen

36:52.521 --> 36:53.989
anything like this.

36:54.056 --> 36:57.359
Now, we're speaking with the
manager of the Paw street market

36:57.426 --> 37:02.298
who's already seeing this
conflict impacting his business.

37:02.364 --> 37:04.200
People are skipping
the puppies and kittens

37:04.266 --> 37:07.069
'and taking home reptiles,
snakes and birds.'

37:07.136 --> 37:09.105
'All much easier to care for.'

37:09.171 --> 37:12.475
- What about the fish?
- Fish don't count.

37:12.541 --> 37:15.677
[instrumental music]

37:16.946 --> 37:19.482
Okay, come clean
about your field agent days.

37:19.548 --> 37:20.516
What happened out there?

37:20.583 --> 37:21.816
Look, it was a long time ago.

37:21.884 --> 37:23.818
I made a mistake, and ever since

37:23.886 --> 37:26.122
I've been behind a desk,
where I belong.

37:26.188 --> 37:27.722
What kind of mistake?

37:27.789 --> 37:30.459
There was a moment,
there's always a moment

37:30.526 --> 37:31.961
and I hesitated.

37:32.027 --> 37:35.431
My partner, my mentor got hurt.

37:35.498 --> 37:37.066
I've never gotten over it.

37:37.133 --> 37:40.702
But listen, we can't forget
that a pet's number one job

37:40.768 --> 37:42.804
is to be there for their humans.

37:42.871 --> 37:44.240
Okay, okay, you're right.

37:44.306 --> 37:47.176
And my boy Max just hasn't
been himself lately.

37:47.243 --> 37:48.810
I've been trying to help,
but he just

37:48.878 --> 37:50.045
he doesn't have time
for me anymore.

37:50.112 --> 37:51.947
Huh, well, my girl Zoey
has been going

37:52.014 --> 37:54.884
through some tough stuff too.
We might have to move.

37:54.950 --> 37:57.086
Max sure could use
someone to talk to.

37:57.153 --> 37:59.488
Preferably someone
who could talk back.

37:59.555 --> 38:02.024
Zoey doesn't have a friend
that understands her either.

38:02.091 --> 38:04.426
She just spends most of her time
on her phone.

38:04.493 --> 38:05.860
Huh, yeah, the phones.

38:05.928 --> 38:08.597
Max turns into a zombie
when he stares at his.

38:08.696 --> 38:10.399
Yeah, Zoey falls asleep
with hers

38:10.466 --> 38:11.799
on the pillow right next to her.

38:11.866 --> 38:13.502
You know, Max used to take me
to play fetch

38:13.569 --> 38:15.004
at the park every night.

38:15.070 --> 38:17.173
Have humans forgotten
that their stress goes down

38:17.239 --> 38:19.008
when they engage
with their pets?

38:19.074 --> 38:21.076
These kids don't even engage
with each other.

38:21.143 --> 38:23.678
Max really needs
a friend like Zoey.

38:23.745 --> 38:26.415
Zoey really needs a friend
like Max.

38:26.482 --> 38:28.050
Meanwhile, a deranged villain

38:28.117 --> 38:30.352
is trying to eliminate
cats and dogs

38:30.419 --> 38:32.087
as human pets forever.

38:32.154 --> 38:33.721
And the only lead we have
depends

38:33.788 --> 38:36.091
on a shifty collection
of vile street cats

38:36.158 --> 38:39.228
who would trade their
grandmothers for a dead mouse.

38:39.295 --> 38:40.795
Why don't you let me
go talk to them?

38:40.862 --> 38:42.064
Are you sure you're ready?

38:42.131 --> 38:45.700
Are you kidding?
I was born ready!

38:45.767 --> 38:48.703
[instrumental music]

38:48.770 --> 38:51.907
[howling]

38:55.710 --> 38:58.380
- Shh!
- Sorry, it's, it's a dog thing.

38:58.447 --> 39:00.950
We like to sing along.

39:01.016 --> 39:04.587
(Gwen) 'A-actually, I change my mind.
I don't wanna do this.'

39:04.653 --> 39:06.355
Uh, rock, paper, scissors?

39:06.422 --> 39:07.456
Loser has to face 'em?

39:07.523 --> 39:10.426
You're on! One, two, three!

39:10.492 --> 39:12.528
I'm paper, you're rock. I win.

39:12.595 --> 39:14.196
No, I'm scissors. I win!

39:14.263 --> 39:16.699
That's not scissors.
How can that be scissors?

39:16.764 --> 39:18.167
That's totally scissors.

39:18.234 --> 39:19.401
If you're gonna throw out
scissors

39:19.468 --> 39:21.604
you've got to grow out
those nails.

39:21.670 --> 39:23.805
[squeaking]

39:24.806 --> 39:26.976
Oh! Oh!

39:27.042 --> 39:28.077
[breathing heavily]

39:28.143 --> 39:31.046
Remember,
you wanted some action.

39:31.113 --> 39:33.215
This is what
you've always wanted.

39:33.282 --> 39:37.052
Prepare yourself for some
disgusting frothing mongrels

39:37.119 --> 39:38.988
munching on dead mice.

39:39.054 --> 39:42.224
- Filth upon filth. Oh!
- 'Psst!'

39:42.291 --> 39:44.226
'Over here.'

39:46.462 --> 39:50.366
Elon Musk? I-I'm looking
for the alley cats?

39:50.432 --> 39:51.467
[screams]

39:51.533 --> 39:54.069
(male #3)
'Then it's your lucky day.'

39:54.136 --> 39:55.770
You're an alley cat?

39:55.837 --> 39:58.540
(male #3) 'Why don't you
step into my office?'

39:58.607 --> 40:01.310
You mean, come into the light?

40:01.377 --> 40:04.179
I thought you guys
usually slept outside.

40:04.246 --> 40:06.982
Drank out of puddles,
ate dead mice.

40:07.049 --> 40:09.318
We did, until some rich doofus

40:09.385 --> 40:11.720
started parking his Tesla
in our alley

40:11.786 --> 40:13.922
and leaving the windows down.

40:13.989 --> 40:16.191
Well, I was told by a shaggy dog

40:16.258 --> 40:18.160
that you might have
information about a job

40:18.227 --> 40:19.962
that was done around here?

40:20.029 --> 40:23.032
Uh, keep it on the down-low
kinda job.

40:23.098 --> 40:26.834
Of course, I do.
I'm the one who did it.

40:26.902 --> 40:29.038
- You?
- That's right.

40:29.104 --> 40:32.775
And I was paid handsomely
for it.

40:32.840 --> 40:33.976
With money?

40:34.043 --> 40:36.345
No, what would a cat do
with money?

40:36.412 --> 40:39.948
I got this shiny ball
of tinfoil. Duh!

40:40.015 --> 40:43.952
Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Fun! Ooh!

40:44.019 --> 40:45.688
[clears throat]
Who hired you?

40:45.754 --> 40:46.922
Don't know.

40:46.989 --> 40:49.191
They communicated
electronically.

40:49.258 --> 40:52.761
Sending text messages
about a covert mission.

40:52.827 --> 40:53.996
So, what was the mission?

40:54.063 --> 40:55.863
I snuck into the headquarters

40:55.931 --> 40:57.399
of a wireless phone company

40:57.466 --> 41:00.002
got some codes
off their computers.

41:00.069 --> 41:01.737
What kind of codes?

41:01.804 --> 41:04.006
Wi-Fi and cellular access codes.

41:04.073 --> 41:09.478
[laughs] Seems like a lot of trouble
just to get some free internet.

41:09.545 --> 41:11.846
Ooh!

41:11.914 --> 41:15.050
[clears throat]
It's just so shiny. Hm!

41:16.352 --> 41:18.787
(Schnauzer on phone)
'Oh! It's an epidemic!'

41:18.853 --> 41:20.522
'Humans are returning
their cats'

41:20.589 --> 41:22.558
'and dogs by the millions.'

41:22.624 --> 41:25.694
'Tell me you've made
some progress.'

41:25.761 --> 41:27.262
We've gathered some intel

41:27.329 --> 41:30.232
but I have no idea
how the pieces fit yet.

41:30.299 --> 41:33.535
Well, l-let's start with this.
What do we know?

41:33.602 --> 41:36.205
(Schnauzer on phone) 'Well,
we know some maniac out there'

41:36.271 --> 41:38.807
'has found a way
to ramp up aggression'

41:38.873 --> 41:40.776
'between cats and dogs.'

41:40.843 --> 41:42.878
And we know he shut down
our entire system

41:42.945 --> 41:45.214
designed to prevent such plots.

41:45.280 --> 41:47.216
And we know someone hired
the alley cats

41:47.282 --> 41:50.285
to steal access codes
for Wi-Fi and cell towers.

41:50.352 --> 41:52.955
And one thing has never made
sense to me.

41:53.021 --> 41:57.292
This plot is devastating
to both cats and dogs.

41:57.359 --> 41:59.661
What kind of lunatic
would device a plot

41:59.728 --> 42:01.296
that hurts all of us?

42:01.363 --> 42:04.867
Well, hard to read the mind
of a lunatic.

42:04.933 --> 42:06.668
Especially a cat lunatic.

42:06.735 --> 42:08.504
Or a dog lunatic.

42:08.570 --> 42:11.473
Maybe we need to think
outside the box.

42:11.540 --> 42:14.476
No, what if it's neither
cat or dog lunatic?

42:14.543 --> 42:16.278
Hm?

42:16.345 --> 42:18.547
Who stands to gain
from humans walking away

42:18.614 --> 42:20.082
from cats and dogs?

42:20.149 --> 42:23.085

Other pets.

42:23.152 --> 42:25.454
So we possibly have a rouge
secondary pet

42:25.521 --> 42:27.756
who's bent on pushing
cats and dogs aside

42:27.823 --> 42:29.258

42:29.324 --> 42:31.593
(Schnauzer on phone)
'Good working theory, agents.'

42:31.660 --> 42:33.897
Agents! He said agents!

42:33.962 --> 42:36.498
But how can he possibly
be reaching

42:36.565 --> 42:39.134
virtually every cat and dog
on the planet?

42:39.201 --> 42:41.537
Through the food? Water?

42:41.603 --> 42:43.705
Wait! That's it!

42:43.772 --> 42:47.409
Wi-Fi cell towers, he doesn't
care about receiving internet

42:47.476 --> 42:50.679
he cares about sending
frequencies.

42:50.746 --> 42:52.648
You mean like hate frequencies?

42:52.714 --> 42:56.752
That only effect
cats and dogs.

01:03:54.342 --> 01:03:57.279
with your worldwide FART system

01:03:57.345 --> 01:03:59.581
rest of us pets sat

01:03:59.648 --> 01:04:02.617
'day after day,
month after month'

01:04:02.684 --> 01:04:06.788
and in my case,
year after year

01:04:06.855 --> 01:04:09.058
waiting for human owners

01:04:09.125 --> 01:04:10.193
that never came.

01:04:10.258 --> 01:04:11.894
That's what this is about?

01:04:11.961 --> 01:04:15.164
That's exactly
what this is about.

01:04:15.230 --> 01:04:17.365
[alarm ringing]

01:04:18.700 --> 01:04:20.435
(Max)
It says he's in here.

01:04:20.502 --> 01:04:22.270
[panting]
Hey, what's going on?

01:04:22.337 --> 01:04:24.406
Wait until they all clear.

01:04:24.473 --> 01:04:26.775
Can't let you in.
Could be a fire in there.

01:04:26.842 --> 01:04:28.978
In need to go inside.
My dog is in there.

01:04:29.045 --> 01:04:30.479
No can do.

01:04:33.916 --> 01:04:35.051
You said it yourself.

01:04:35.118 --> 01:04:36.651
You've never been a pet.

01:04:36.718 --> 01:04:38.587
So you don't know
what that bond is like.

01:04:38.653 --> 01:04:40.622
I don't believe in that anymore.

01:04:40.689 --> 01:04:42.691
And maybe you'll stop
believing, too.

01:04:42.758 --> 01:04:44.326
'After yearning to be a pet'

01:04:44.392 --> 01:04:46.495
'day after day
and year after year'

01:04:46.561 --> 01:04:48.898
'on an island
where the only humans'

01:04:48.965 --> 01:04:50.465
are skeletal remains

01:04:50.532 --> 01:04:53.936
of long dead explorers.

01:04:54.003 --> 01:04:55.104
Close up the crates!

01:04:55.171 --> 01:04:57.405
So we can bid a fond farewell

01:04:57.472 --> 01:05:02.211
to the failed cats and dogs
of Zone 867.

01:05:02.277 --> 01:05:03.645
[alarm ringing]

01:05:05.614 --> 01:05:08.550
Hey, I said don't go
in there, you rebels.

01:05:09.518 --> 01:05:11.319
Uh, they'll be fine.

01:05:11.386 --> 01:05:13.321
We've got company.

01:05:16.792 --> 01:05:19.061
- That's Max.
- And Zoe.

01:05:20.796 --> 01:05:22.231
(Roger)
'They tracked my GPS collar.'

01:05:22.297 --> 01:05:24.666
Max must've noticed I was gone.

01:05:24.733 --> 01:05:27.036
He still does care about me.

01:05:27.103 --> 01:05:28.770
Stop him, girls.

01:05:28.837 --> 01:05:29.805
[hissing]

01:05:29.871 --> 01:05:31.040
[whimpers]

01:05:31.107 --> 01:05:33.441
[intense music]

01:05:34.309 --> 01:05:35.912
- Roger!
- Rog!

01:05:35.978 --> 01:05:37.646
Roger!

01:05:37.712 --> 01:05:39.748
Humans are gonna save us.

01:05:41.416 --> 01:05:42.885
Get rid of the humans!

01:05:42.952 --> 01:05:45.754
[laughs]
I'll do better than that.

01:05:46.755 --> 01:05:49.658
I did some late night research

01:05:49.724 --> 01:05:52.295
that revealed frequencies

01:05:52.360 --> 01:05:54.696
impacting the human brain.

01:05:56.933 --> 01:05:58.067
[high pitched sound]

01:05:58.134 --> 01:05:59.467
[screaming]

01:05:59.534 --> 01:06:01.304
Geez! What is that?

01:06:01.369 --> 01:06:02.972
[all screaming]

01:06:04.840 --> 01:06:05.942
Ow!

01:06:07.776 --> 01:06:09.711
[groaning]

01:06:10.846 --> 01:06:12.081
Mom.

01:06:12.148 --> 01:06:13.883
[groaning]

01:06:13.950 --> 01:06:16.484
- Stop it.
- You're hurting them.

01:06:16.551 --> 01:06:18.620
[hissing]

01:06:20.589 --> 01:06:22.091
Close up the crates!

01:06:26.494 --> 01:06:28.030
Well, my work here is done.

01:06:28.097 --> 01:06:31.234
So I'm gonna make
like a bulldog and flee.

01:06:31.300 --> 01:06:33.835
Flee. Get it? Flee?

01:06:33.903 --> 01:06:35.370
[croaks]

01:06:35.437 --> 01:06:37.372
Anyway, you all
have a nice trip.

01:06:37.439 --> 01:06:40.109
Zeek, bring me
my iron dog suit.

01:06:44.881 --> 01:06:46.082
[laughs]

01:06:50.286 --> 01:06:52.454
[Roger grunting]

01:06:54.456 --> 01:06:57.492
- What now?
- 'No one hurts my human.'

01:07:00.263 --> 01:07:03.132
Oh, my head. Ah! My head.

01:07:03.199 --> 01:07:04.833
I just need a minute.

01:07:06.202 --> 01:07:08.470
[hissing]

01:07:08.536 --> 01:07:09.504
(Gwen)
'I'm with you, partner.'

01:07:09.571 --> 01:07:10.940
'If my Zoe's in trouble'

01:07:11.007 --> 01:07:12.975
'I'd run through a brick wall
for her.'

01:07:13.042 --> 01:07:16.212
'Ow! Oh! Ow! Oh!'

01:07:16.279 --> 01:07:17.712
'Ooh! Ow!'

01:07:17.779 --> 01:07:19.916
'Why couldn't you've locked us
in a paper sack?'

01:07:19.982 --> 01:07:22.084
Didn't want you
to get a paper cut.

01:07:23.219 --> 01:07:24.552
[crashing]

01:07:25.420 --> 01:07:28.024
Nobody hurts my friends' humans.

01:07:31.726 --> 01:07:34.263
- Thanks, big guy.
- Yeah, I got your back, kid.

01:07:34.330 --> 01:07:36.065
This is so annoying.

01:07:36.132 --> 01:07:37.699
[growls]

01:07:41.469 --> 01:07:42.871
[hissing]

01:07:42.939 --> 01:07:44.974
You really care about them
that much?

01:07:45.041 --> 01:07:47.776
We would do anything for them.
That's what pets do.

01:07:47.842 --> 01:07:50.445
Just like they would do
anything for us.

01:07:52.415 --> 01:07:53.815
Ow!

01:07:56.785 --> 01:07:58.054
Ow.

01:07:59.989 --> 01:08:02.524
[mellow music]

01:08:15.603 --> 01:08:16.906
Hello.

01:08:18.606 --> 01:08:20.774
[panting]

01:08:23.645 --> 01:08:25.982
Yeah. Okay.

01:08:28.483 --> 01:08:31.319
Uh, what is this thing
I'm feelin'?

01:08:31.386 --> 01:08:34.457
It's so... strange.

01:08:34.522 --> 01:08:36.158
It's called affection.

01:08:36.225 --> 01:08:38.560
It's what people do
for the pets they love.

01:08:38.626 --> 01:08:40.062
You're a cool bird.

01:08:40.129 --> 01:08:43.265
I'm, I'm enjoyin' it.

01:08:43.332 --> 01:08:45.434
Enough of this!

01:08:45.533 --> 01:08:46.969
Want me to turn up the frequency

01:08:47.036 --> 01:08:49.738
and get that clingy,
foolish bugs off you?

01:08:49.804 --> 01:08:53.376
No, turn it off! Let them go!

01:08:53.442 --> 01:08:54.743
I'm a changed bird.

01:08:54.809 --> 01:08:58.046
I-I've seen the light
at the end of the cage.

01:08:58.113 --> 01:08:59.448
- What?
- What?

01:08:59.514 --> 01:09:04.551
By the way, animals talkin',
our little secret, okay?

01:09:04.618 --> 01:09:06.720
I got you, super bird.

01:09:09.191 --> 01:09:10.859
Super bird? Oh..

01:09:10.926 --> 01:09:15.331
I didn't study code
every night for two years

01:09:15.398 --> 01:09:18.200
to watch you go soft on me.

01:09:18.267 --> 01:09:20.136
That was not the plan.

01:09:20.202 --> 01:09:22.938
Yeah, well, you didn't
make the plan.

01:09:23.005 --> 01:09:24.606
I did.

01:09:24.671 --> 01:09:26.640
I have a new purpose now.

01:09:26.707 --> 01:09:30.345
Everyone should feel
the love of a human.

01:09:30.412 --> 01:09:33.515
You're not going anywhere.

01:09:33.581 --> 01:09:34.917
[device beeping]

01:09:37.486 --> 01:09:40.423
[alarm blaring]

01:09:40.488 --> 01:09:42.857
What are you doing? It's over.

01:09:42.925 --> 01:09:46.594
So hand me the phone and get
ready for your new family.

01:09:46.661 --> 01:09:48.763
I don't want a family.

01:09:48.830 --> 01:09:52.368
And I don't wanna be trapped
in a tiny space

01:09:52.435 --> 01:09:54.869
being force-fed crickets.

01:09:54.937 --> 01:09:57.073
Okay, well, then
what do you want?

01:09:57.139 --> 01:09:58.673
I want it all.

01:09:58.740 --> 01:10:02.278
'Reptiles once ruled
the planet unopposed.'

01:10:02.344 --> 01:10:05.613
We were here millions
of years before dogs.

01:10:05.680 --> 01:10:08.551
Before cats, before anyone!

01:10:08.616 --> 01:10:10.352
Not before fish!

01:10:10.419 --> 01:10:11.954
(all)
Fish don't count.

01:10:12.021 --> 01:10:16.225
It's time my reptilian brothers
and I once again

01:10:16.292 --> 01:10:20.628
take our place at the top
of the food chain!

01:10:20.695 --> 01:10:22.797
The top? That would mean that...

01:10:22.864 --> 01:10:25.633
- Exactly!
- Zeek.

01:10:25.700 --> 01:10:27.169
I order you to stop.

01:10:27.236 --> 01:10:29.804
Bird frequency, anyone?

01:10:31.773 --> 01:10:33.876
[screams]

01:10:35.945 --> 01:10:37.645
I gotta do somethin'.

01:10:37.712 --> 01:10:39.315
'I gotta get to that phone.'

01:10:39.381 --> 01:10:40.715
No, you won't make it.

01:10:40.782 --> 01:10:43.452
There's always a moment

01:10:43.519 --> 01:10:46.355
and this is that moment.

01:10:46.422 --> 01:10:48.090
Cover me, partner.

01:10:48.157 --> 01:10:49.892
Did you just call me partner?

01:10:49.959 --> 01:10:51.626
I'm goin' for that phone.

01:10:53.095 --> 01:10:54.230
[groaning]

01:10:56.664 --> 01:10:58.666
Now that's a field agent.

01:10:58.733 --> 01:11:00.002
[hissing]

01:11:02.905 --> 01:11:06.208
Okay, girls, ready to rumble?

01:11:06.275 --> 01:11:08.077
But first, catnap.

01:11:08.144 --> 01:11:09.278
[snoring]

01:11:11.547 --> 01:11:13.115
JK, JK.

01:11:15.251 --> 01:11:17.486
Tap and out!
Told you I was a ninja.

01:11:17.553 --> 01:11:19.421
Want some more of this,
cream-puff?

01:11:19.488 --> 01:11:21.056
Oh, not again.

01:11:21.123 --> 01:11:25.793
That's what I thought.
160 pounds of pure whiskey..

01:11:27.695 --> 01:11:29.064
[coughs]

01:11:29.131 --> 01:11:30.432
[groans]

01:11:30.499 --> 01:11:32.401
It's all mine now.

01:11:32.468 --> 01:11:34.236
[laughs]

01:11:37.640 --> 01:11:39.175
No.

01:11:39.241 --> 01:11:42.411
No parachute!

01:11:42.478 --> 01:11:44.313
[screaming]

01:11:46.848 --> 01:11:49.885
(Zeek) Your shots
better be up to date.

01:11:49.952 --> 01:11:52.354
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
Okay. Okay.

01:11:52.421 --> 01:11:55.558
How about that? I can fly!

01:11:55.624 --> 01:12:00.062
If you know what's good for you,
you'll bring me that phone.

01:12:04.500 --> 01:12:06.302
What are you doing?

01:12:08.137 --> 01:12:12.274
Cats and dogs and humans.
Back to normal.

01:12:12.341 --> 01:12:14.476
No!

01:12:14.543 --> 01:12:17.046
All pain frequencies erased.

01:12:17.112 --> 01:12:20.416
And I just disabled
your GPS micro chip.

01:12:20.482 --> 01:12:23.419
Your owners won't know
what happened.

01:12:27.022 --> 01:12:29.391
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. And you?

01:12:29.458 --> 01:12:30.492
Yeah.

01:12:31.594 --> 01:12:33.395
[sighs]

01:12:33.462 --> 01:12:34.463
Whoo.

01:12:34.530 --> 01:12:36.165
[indistinct chatter]

01:12:40.436 --> 01:12:41.971
What was that?

01:12:43.072 --> 01:12:45.873
Wait, Roger's GPS collar,
it's gone.

01:12:45.941 --> 01:12:47.809
Disa-disappeared.

01:12:47.876 --> 01:12:49.777
So, he's not inside.

01:12:49.844 --> 01:12:51.813
[sighs]
Stupid phone.

01:12:51.880 --> 01:12:53.983
Probably didn't even work
in the first place.

01:12:54.049 --> 01:12:56.051
Didn't I tell you
not to go in there?

01:12:56.118 --> 01:12:57.553
Should we head back
to the house?

01:12:57.620 --> 01:12:59.521
[sighs]
Yeah.

01:12:59.588 --> 01:13:01.590
Just ignore me.

01:13:01.657 --> 01:13:03.459
[gasps]
There you are.

01:13:05.394 --> 01:13:08.931
- I saw the coolest bird.
- Oh, a bird?

01:13:08.998 --> 01:13:11.634
Dude, it's an emergency,
off the phone.

01:13:11.700 --> 01:13:13.135
Yeah.

01:13:15.504 --> 01:13:17.539
Alright, everyone,
sorry about that.

01:13:18.773 --> 01:13:21.043
Do with me what you want.

01:13:21.110 --> 01:13:22.911
This is not over.

01:13:22.978 --> 01:13:25.247
Oh, I think it is.

01:13:25.314 --> 01:13:26.582
[grunts]

01:13:26.649 --> 01:13:28.717
Case closed, lizard.

01:13:28.783 --> 01:13:30.986
What? No.

01:13:31.053 --> 01:13:34.023
I think it's finally time
I retire.

01:13:34.089 --> 01:13:35.823
There's always a moment.

01:13:35.891 --> 01:13:37.526
Right, old buddy?

01:13:37.593 --> 01:13:38.961
(Gwen)
'Wait, your old partner'

01:13:39.028 --> 01:13:41.230
your mentor, that was Ed?

01:13:41.297 --> 01:13:43.932
I always knew he was
a field agent.

01:13:43.999 --> 01:13:46.035
Just had to make sure he knew.

01:13:46.101 --> 01:13:47.269
Tell me somethin', Ed.

01:13:47.336 --> 01:13:50.739
