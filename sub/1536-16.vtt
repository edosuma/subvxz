00:00.960 --> 00:02.121
Previously on Grimm...

00:02.200 --> 00:03.360
What's the problem?

00:03.560 --> 00:06.166
It appears to be related to
what my mother did to save my life.

00:06.240 --> 00:09.403
Residual effect from my
visit to the other side.

00:09.560 --> 00:11.369
I see the way
you're looking at me.

00:11.600 --> 00:13.329
Juliette.
It's not the same.

00:13.760 --> 00:14.886
It'll never be the same.

00:14.960 --> 00:16.720
Hi, you've reached Juliette.
Leave a message.

00:16.880 --> 00:19.804
We need to talk. Please,
please, call me back.

00:19.920 --> 00:21.046
I need a place to stay.

00:21.120 --> 00:23.771
No. I can't go home until
I figure out what I am.

00:23.960 --> 00:25.485
I need you to open a book.

00:25.560 --> 00:28.211
It's the book that Ada/ind used to
do what she did to you and Nick.

00:28.520 --> 00:29.806
This, I want to read.

00:30.120 --> 00:33.283
You are going
to have another baby.

00:33.520 --> 00:35.966
That's impossible. I
haven't been with anyone.

00:36.120 --> 00:38.248
Well, you must
have been with someone.

00:38.680 --> 00:40.640
You're just gonna have to
have a different father.

00:40.680 --> 00:42.967
Maybe a royal one.

00:43.120 --> 00:45.122
It shouldn't be that
hard to get him into bed.

00:45.360 --> 00:47.203
Will I get a chance
to say goodbye to Viktor?

00:47.400 --> 00:50.131
No, another member of the family
will be joining you soon.

00:52.800 --> 00:55.280
"How the silly frog does talk!

00:55.360 --> 00:58.170
"He can be no companion
to any human being."

01:07.280 --> 01:08.964
There's nothing in here.

01:09.040 --> 01:11.327
What?
For me or for you.

01:11.400 --> 01:13.200
Now, where is your mother?
She did this to me.

01:13.480 --> 01:15.926
Juliette, she said there was a
possibility of some side effects.

01:16.000 --> 01:17.411
She didn't know this
would happen to you.

01:17.480 --> 01:18.891
Now, please.
You need to calm down.

01:18.960 --> 01:20.689
No, I'm done
calming down, okay?

01:20.760 --> 01:23.411
You and Nick and Adalind, and
all of this Wesen insanity,

01:23.520 --> 01:24.851
lam so sick of it!

01:24.920 --> 01:27.764
Okay, I was normal
before I met all of you.

01:27.840 --> 01:30.002
I want my life back!

01:30.720 --> 01:32.006
And if I don't get it...

01:32.560 --> 01:33.561
What?

01:34.320 --> 01:35.845
You better watch out.

02:12.000 --> 02:13.411
Hey, Bella.

02:14.000 --> 02:15.490
You were pumping it today.

02:15.560 --> 02:19.281
Great ride, huh? Of course,
I had the best view.

02:19.600 --> 02:20.806
I was right behind you.

02:20.880 --> 02:22.120
My view was better.

02:23.080 --> 02:24.127
You weren't in it.

02:25.760 --> 02:28.684
When are we gonna go for a ride
together, just the two of us?

02:28.760 --> 02:29.761
Bikes optional.

02:30.480 --> 02:31.520
Knock it off, Ricky.

02:31.560 --> 02:33.324
Knock what off?
Just leave her alone.

02:33.400 --> 02:35.164
Oh, you're her
bodyguard now.

02:35.240 --> 02:36.287
You know what I'm saying.

02:36.360 --> 02:37.600
Yeah, I know
what you're saying.

02:38.360 --> 02:39.600
You're in love.

02:41.200 --> 02:42.645
Shut up.

03:07.760 --> 03:10.047
Bella.
Bella, are you all right?

03:11.120 --> 03:12.645
Yeah, I'm okay.

03:13.520 --> 03:14.851
Are you sure
nothing's broken?

03:14.960 --> 03:16.291
Yeah.

03:16.680 --> 03:18.125
Good thing I
was following you.

03:18.760 --> 03:21.001
Following me? Why?

03:22.080 --> 03:23.286
I just need to talk to you.

03:24.280 --> 03:25.440
I'm sorry about
what happened.

03:25.760 --> 03:30.402
It's okay. Rick's a jerk.
You can't change that.

03:33.160 --> 03:35.128
Look, I gotta go.
Just hold on.

03:35.640 --> 03:37.244
You're always
in such a hurry.

03:37.400 --> 03:39.440
Zack, I really got to go. No.
Look, you're bleeding.

03:39.480 --> 03:41.323
Don't.
I'm not making this up.

03:42.480 --> 03:43.606
I'm okay.

03:45.240 --> 03:46.924
Look, Bella.

03:47.880 --> 03:48.961
I like you.

03:50.840 --> 03:52.171
I think you're
really great.

03:52.240 --> 03:54.527
If you'd just slow down long
enough to have a conversation...

03:54.600 --> 03:57.490
No. Now, look, Zack,

03:57.560 --> 04:00.370
you're a really nice guy and
everything, okay, but I can't...

04:00.480 --> 04:02.608
Oh, God. Oh, God, get away.
What is it?

04:02.720 --> 04:04.085
You have to go.

04:04.160 --> 04:05.321
What did I do?

04:05.800 --> 04:06.847
Don't touch me.

04:07.000 --> 04:08.809
You're hurt.

04:10.560 --> 04:11.641
Please.

04:12.160 --> 04:13.810
Look, I'm not leaving you.

04:14.520 --> 04:15.520
I'm in love with you.

04:15.560 --> 04:16.641
Don't touch me. No!

04:22.640 --> 04:24.210
I told you.

04:31.160 --> 04:33.162
Oh, God.
What's happening?

05:17.000 --> 05:19.241
Hi, you've reached Juliette.
Leave a message.

05:20.760 --> 05:23.411
Juliette, it's me.
Call me.

05:25.240 --> 05:26.526
I don't know
what else to say.

05:28.320 --> 05:30.402
- You order yet?
-  No.

05:31.640 --> 05:32.766
You going to order?

05:32.880 --> 05:33.927
Nah.

05:35.240 --> 05:36.765
Something going on?

05:38.040 --> 05:39.087
Juliette walked out.

05:39.280 --> 05:40.850
Why? Did you
guys have a fight?

05:40.920 --> 05:44.970
A fight, I could deal with.
This, not so much.

05:45.600 --> 05:47.090
What happened?

05:47.560 --> 05:48.891
You know what we
had to go through

05:48.960 --> 05:50.291
to undo what
Adalind did?

05:50.800 --> 05:52.211
Yeah.

05:54.160 --> 05:55.321
Well, there was
a side effect.

05:56.320 --> 06:00.245
You all right? Yeah, it's
not what happened to me.

06:01.320 --> 06:02.685
I don't like
where this is going.

06:02.840 --> 06:04.205
It doesn't get any better.

06:06.400 --> 06:07.765
Juliette's a Hexenbiest.

06:10.120 --> 06:11.246
Run that past me again.

06:11.320 --> 06:14.290
I knew something was wrong.
I just didn't know what.

06:15.120 --> 06:16.565
And she was trying to figure
out a way to tell me,

06:16.640 --> 06:19.007
but she just couldn't.

06:19.120 --> 06:20.167
So how did you find out?

06:26.760 --> 06:28.444
How is this possible?
I don't know.

06:28.880 --> 06:30.880
If I knew, I would never
have put her through this.

06:31.160 --> 06:32.491
All right, so what do
you want me to do?

06:32.640 --> 06:33.971
I don't know.

06:35.360 --> 06:37.442
I don't even know
what I'm dealing with.

06:38.000 --> 06:39.650
Neither does she.

06:41.480 --> 06:42.925
I don't have a lot of
luck with Hexenbiests.

06:43.040 --> 06:45.321
And she may be afraid of what
you might do to her.

06:45.600 --> 06:47.807
Man, this is really messed up.
Yeah.

06:48.760 --> 06:49.921
Can you undo it?

06:51.000 --> 06:52.684
Not from what I'm told.

06:55.960 --> 06:58.531
Man, no wonder
you're not hungry.

07:01.240 --> 07:03.004
If there's anything
I can do to help...

07:03.920 --> 07:05.480
Right now, she's not
even talking to me.

07:09.800 --> 07:11.040
Burkhardt.

07:11.880 --> 07:12.881
Where?

07:14.720 --> 07:15.926
All right.

07:16.840 --> 07:18.808
Got a dead body at
Mount Tabor Park.

07:20.720 --> 07:24.361
Cyclist discovered a bike on
the trail up there, and a helmet,

07:25.200 --> 07:26.645
then saw the body down here.

07:26.800 --> 07:28.564
Looks like some kind
of allergic reaction,

07:28.680 --> 07:30.489
but I doubt it's
the flora or fauna.

07:30.640 --> 07:33.644
It doesn't look like acid.
Face isn't burned.

07:34.360 --> 07:36.362
My guess is,
it happened up there.

07:36.440 --> 07:38.442
He was either overcome by
something that happened earlier,

07:38.560 --> 07:41.211
like maybe he ate something
that didn't agree with him.

07:42.080 --> 07:43.411
In a big way.

07:45.160 --> 07:48.687
Zack Blumenthal, 26 years old.
Lives off of Thurman.

07:50.720 --> 07:53.371
Organ donor, but I
think that ship has sailed.

07:54.960 --> 07:57.406
Do we think this is
a homicide or an accident?

07:57.880 --> 07:58.881
Or neither?

07:58.960 --> 08:00.485
I think we should
wait for the M.E. report.

08:00.560 --> 08:01.891
Why don't we
check out his place?

08:02.040 --> 08:03.371
Hopefully, one of
these keys will open it up.

08:03.440 --> 08:04.521
Yeah.

08:08.400 --> 08:10.243
Police.
Anybody home?

08:12.840 --> 08:14.080
Police.

08:14.760 --> 08:15.966
Coming in.

08:24.920 --> 08:26.490
Drawings of shoes.

08:26.560 --> 08:28.085
Designer. Interesting.

08:28.160 --> 08:29.520
Well, it looks like
he lives alone.

08:29.880 --> 08:31.291
Not that that's a bad thing.

08:32.120 --> 08:33.610
Yeah.

08:33.720 --> 08:35.802
Do Monroe and Rosalee
know about Juliette?

08:36.080 --> 08:37.730
Nope, just you.

08:40.159 --> 08:41.809
You know you gotta tell them.

08:42.280 --> 08:43.884
Maybe she already has.

08:44.159 --> 08:45.525
Got a photo.

08:46.560 --> 08:47.766
A woman.

08:49.760 --> 08:50.966
Pretty.

08:51.240 --> 08:52.287
I got his laptop.

08:53.800 --> 08:55.609
And drawings of a woman.

08:58.800 --> 08:59.801
She looks the same.

09:00.000 --> 09:01.411
Sister?

09:01.480 --> 09:02.811
Girlfriend?

09:02.880 --> 09:04.609
Definitely not his mother.

09:05.120 --> 09:06.929
Well, he's paying this
much attention to her,

09:07.040 --> 09:08.849
we better figure
out who she is.

09:10.480 --> 09:11.561
Mom?

09:11.640 --> 09:12.641
What's wrong?

09:13.360 --> 09:16.489
It happened.
I couldn't stop it.

09:16.920 --> 09:18.410
Where are you?

09:18.480 --> 09:19.925
I'm at home.

09:20.440 --> 09:22.169
The body there?
No.

09:23.320 --> 09:27.245
I am so sorry.

09:27.320 --> 09:29.721
Stay there.
I'm on my way.

09:45.680 --> 09:48.206
Prince Viktor's been
sent back to Vienna.

09:49.760 --> 09:52.604
What?
I just found out myself.

09:52.680 --> 09:55.126
My father must have grown
impatient with him.

09:55.240 --> 09:56.321
Is Viktor dead?

09:56.440 --> 09:57.885
Don't know.

09:57.960 --> 09:58.961
What about Adalind?

09:59.040 --> 10:00.041
Haven't heard
anything about her.

10:00.160 --> 10:01.286
Who's replacing Viktor?

10:01.760 --> 10:03.444
I don't think
anybody knows.

10:03.520 --> 10:04.760
At least they're
not telling me.

10:05.320 --> 10:08.210
They didn't get rid of Viktor
because he's moving too fast.

10:09.160 --> 10:12.209
They want Kelly Burkhardt
and that child.

10:12.280 --> 10:13.441
If you want me
to go back there,

10:13.520 --> 10:14.965
you better give me
something to show them.

10:15.040 --> 10:16.087
Yeah. I've got it ready.

10:19.680 --> 10:22.763
You give them this. It'll look
like you're making progress.

10:23.240 --> 10:24.241
Any of it true?

10:24.800 --> 10:26.131
Enough to make
it plausible.

10:31.240 --> 10:32.810
I didn't mean
to hurt him.

10:33.360 --> 10:34.885
I didn't even
know he liked me.

10:34.960 --> 10:37.167
You're
a beautiful girl, Bella.

10:37.280 --> 10:40.648
I didn't do anything to
encourage it, Mom. I swear.

10:42.160 --> 10:43.241
What do I do?

10:43.320 --> 10:47.245
You just go on with your life
as though nothing has happened.

10:47.480 --> 10:48.720
How can I?

10:49.240 --> 10:51.288
What happened
is not your fault.

10:53.400 --> 10:54.640
And what if
somebody finds out?

10:54.720 --> 10:56.324
No one can prove
you did anything.

10:56.400 --> 10:58.243
I still killed him, Mom.

10:58.600 --> 11:01.763
You do nothing. You say nothing.
You understand?

11:04.480 --> 11:07.086
Or do you want your life
ruined the way mine was?

11:13.880 --> 11:15.564
Looked through
the vic's laptop.

11:17.360 --> 11:19.169
E-mails are
pretty innocuous.

11:20.600 --> 11:22.409
Nothing noteworthy
in his search history.

11:22.480 --> 11:23.641
GO.

11:24.960 --> 11:26.200
Counter Strike
Global Offensive.

11:26.240 --> 11:28.242
Online tactical
first-person shooter game.

11:28.320 --> 11:29.446
Awesome in every way.

11:30.600 --> 11:31.965
So I heard.

11:32.080 --> 11:34.890
And then, there were these.

11:34.960 --> 11:36.962
Same woman he had
a photo of on his fridge.

11:37.200 --> 11:39.168
Looks like she wasn't aware
anyone was taking her photo.

11:39.240 --> 11:42.483
There is more of our mystery
girl on Zack's page.

11:44.800 --> 11:46.882
She definitely meant
something to this guy.

11:46.960 --> 11:48.520
Do any of these
photos link to her page?

11:48.560 --> 11:49.561
No, they're not tagged,

11:49.640 --> 11:51.280
and she doesn't seem
to have her own page.

11:52.560 --> 11:54.688
But check this out.
I clicked on the photos.

11:54.760 --> 11:56.762
They're tagged to
River City Riders.

11:56.880 --> 11:58.609
They meet up for group rides
a few times a week.

11:58.680 --> 12:01.684
And here she is
on their homepage.

12:01.760 --> 12:03.330
Next ride is
scheduled for today,

12:03.400 --> 12:06.006
starting at Harvey Scott
Memorial at Mount Tabor Park.

12:06.120 --> 12:07.804
That's pretty close to where
Zack's body was found.

12:07.880 --> 12:09.723
Well, let's see
if she shows.

12:20.080 --> 12:21.081
Excuse me.

12:21.160 --> 12:22.161
Is there
a problem?

12:22.280 --> 12:24.408
Do you know
a Zack Blumenthal?

12:24.480 --> 12:25.766
Yeah, I know him.

12:25.840 --> 12:27.922
If you're looking for him,
he hasn't shown up yet.

12:28.000 --> 12:29.843
Well, I'm sorry,
but Zack's dead.

12:30.520 --> 12:32.648
What? Oh, my God.

12:32.720 --> 12:33.880
What do you mean,
Zack's dead?

12:34.200 --> 12:36.441
His body was found yesterday
morning off one of the trails.

12:36.520 --> 12:37.601
Did he crash?

12:37.840 --> 12:38.841
What happened?

12:38.920 --> 12:40.331
We're still trying
to figure that out.

12:40.400 --> 12:42.926
And we're hoping to talk
to whoever saw him last.

12:43.480 --> 12:45.926
He was here for yesterday's ride.
We all saw him.

12:46.000 --> 12:47.161
Anyone see him leave?

12:47.240 --> 12:48.480
Yeah, I saw him leave.

12:48.560 --> 12:49.925
He went after Bella.
Is she here?

12:50.000 --> 12:51.809
No, haven%
seen her today.

12:52.440 --> 12:54.169
- Is this Bella?
- Yes.

12:54.240 --> 12:55.685
Yeah, that's her.
Bella Turner.

12:56.200 --> 12:57.884
What was Zack's
relationship with Bella?

12:57.960 --> 12:59.200
I don't think he had one.

12:59.280 --> 13:00.281
Nobody does with her.

13:00.360 --> 13:01.407
What do you mean?

13:01.480 --> 13:03.926
She's nice, but she
kind of keeps to herself.

13:04.360 --> 13:05.771
She likes to ride more than
she likes to hang out.

13:05.840 --> 13:07.365
She never hangs out.

13:07.520 --> 13:10.410
Any reason why Zack would have a bunch
of pictures of her at his house?

13:10.560 --> 13:11.846
Yeah, I think he's
in love with her.

13:11.920 --> 13:13.206
But she never paid
any attention to him.

13:13.280 --> 13:14.805
You know where she lives? No.

13:15.200 --> 13:16.645
She never really talks.

13:16.720 --> 13:18.688
But she's a real
pedal masher.

13:18.800 --> 13:20.800
Nobody knows where she
lives, only where she works.

13:21.040 --> 13:23.088
City Bikes on Ankeny.

13:23.160 --> 13:25.606
All right, I'm gonna need
to get you guys' names.

13:26.400 --> 13:27.367
Wu, what do you got?

13:27.440 --> 13:28.930
Prelim tox
report from the M.E.

13:29.040 --> 13:31.725
Anything in Zack's medical
records about lethal allergies?

13:31.800 --> 13:34.326
No, Zack Blumenthal
was killed by a toxin

13:34.400 --> 13:36.846
that caused acute
systolic heart failure.

13:37.240 --> 13:39.481
Basically,
this guy's heart broke.

13:40.240 --> 13:43.164
However, this toxin
doesn't really exist.

13:43.240 --> 13:45.846
And by "doesn't really exist,"
you mean what?

13:45.920 --> 13:48.960
It's most closely
related to a Phyllobates terribilis,

13:49.200 --> 13:50.725
a frog from
the Colombian jungles,

13:50.800 --> 13:53.167
but not exactly.
It's a batrachotoxin,

13:53.240 --> 13:56.323
which is only found in three
poisonous frogs from Colombia

13:56.400 --> 13:58.880
and three poisonous birds
from Papua New Guinea.

13:58.960 --> 14:00.689
And I'm not even
gonna try to pronounce

14:00.760 --> 14:02.444
the name of said
frogs and birds.

14:02.760 --> 14:07.766
And let me just add, one ounce of
this poison kills 10,000 mice,

14:07.840 --> 14:10.446
10 to 20 humans and two
African bull elephants.

14:10.600 --> 14:13.126
How do I know this?
I looked it up.

14:13.240 --> 14:15.288
So where did the poison
that killed Zack come from?

14:17.960 --> 14:19.803
I think it's got
to be Wesen.

14:19.960 --> 14:21.121
How did
the M.E. explain it?

14:21.200 --> 14:22.201
She couldn't.

14:22.280 --> 14:25.363
We got a name for the woman in the photos.
It's Bella Turner.

14:25.480 --> 14:27.369
Got it. I'll run a background.

14:29.400 --> 14:30.765
Why hasn't Viktor called?

14:31.560 --> 14:32.971
Is he still alive?

14:35.320 --> 14:37.049
You shouldn't worry
about Viktor anymore.

14:37.480 --> 14:38.891
Well, you're awfully loyal.

14:39.600 --> 14:42.604
I'm loyal to the family, not
to any particular member.

14:43.240 --> 14:45.447
Am I a member
of that family?

14:46.080 --> 14:47.286
Your child is.

14:47.360 --> 14:49.283
I thought that's why
we came here.

14:49.360 --> 14:51.488
Is anybody doing anything
about finding her?

14:52.400 --> 14:55.643
Believe me, the family knows
how important she is.

14:56.360 --> 14:58.089
The King is doing
everything he can to...

15:00.720 --> 15:02.051
Excuse me.

15:02.960 --> 15:04.007
Yes?

15:06.280 --> 15:07.361
When?

15:08.800 --> 15:09.847
No.

15:10.400 --> 15:11.765
We'll be ready.

15:12.640 --> 15:13.687
Ready for what?

15:15.200 --> 15:16.247
Take care of this.

15:18.600 --> 15:21.080
You might want to change into
something more appropriate.

15:21.160 --> 15:22.207
Why?

15:22.280 --> 15:24.203
Well, I wouldn't want to meet
Prince Kenneth in a robe.

15:24.280 --> 15:25.725
Prince Kenneth?
Do you know him?

15:25.800 --> 15:27.165
By reputation.

15:28.680 --> 15:30.125
Well, what's he like?

15:34.120 --> 15:35.360
Results.

15:36.720 --> 15:39.849
If Zack went after
Bella, caught up with her,

15:39.920 --> 15:43.163
are we thinking she's a witness
to what happened or involved?

15:43.240 --> 15:44.287
Might be either.

15:46.120 --> 15:49.602
What's the motive? They
supposedly had no relationship.

15:49.680 --> 15:51.205
Maybe Zack
thought they did.

15:52.000 --> 15:53.445
All right,
before we go in,

15:53.520 --> 15:55.124
are we thinking
Bella's Wesen?

15:55.200 --> 15:56.201
Well, could be.

15:56.320 --> 15:58.240
If she is, we don't know
what we're dealing with.

15:58.560 --> 16:00.005
Only way we'll know is
if I get her to Woge.

16:00.080 --> 16:01.206
If she is,
let me know?

16:01.640 --> 16:04.007
If I pull my gun, that'll
be a good indication.

16:08.880 --> 16:10.211
I'm looking
for Bella Turner.

16:10.320 --> 16:11.560
Yeah.
She's right there.

16:17.720 --> 16:19.245
Bella Turner.

16:20.440 --> 16:22.363
Yeah. You know Zack Blumenthal?

16:22.440 --> 16:24.681
Yeah, we're in the same
cycling club. Why?

16:25.320 --> 16:27.004
Well, his body
was found yesterday

16:27.080 --> 16:29.003
off of one of
the biking trails.

16:29.080 --> 16:30.366
Oh, my God.

16:31.080 --> 16:33.242
Zack's dead?
What happened?

16:33.600 --> 16:35.520
We were hoping you could
help us figure that out.

16:36.240 --> 16:38.925
Me? We talked to some
of your cycling club.

16:39.000 --> 16:40.968
They said Zack followed you.

16:41.080 --> 16:44.004
We were wondering if you saw him
again after yesterday's ride.

16:44.080 --> 16:46.924
Uh, yeah. Yeah, he caught
up to me on the trail.

16:47.280 --> 16:49.362
Did you two talk?
A little.

16:49.800 --> 16:50.847
What about?

16:50.920 --> 16:54.811
Look, uh, Zack was interested
in going out and I wasn't.

16:54.880 --> 16:59.408
So I told him and, you know,
just got on my bike and left.

16:59.480 --> 17:00.766
That was the last
I saw him.

17:00.880 --> 17:02.723
So you two weren't
having a relationship?

17:03.280 --> 17:04.441
No.

17:04.680 --> 17:05.761
But he wanted to?

17:06.760 --> 17:08.569
Yes, and I told him
I wasn't interested.

17:08.960 --> 17:10.803
How did he respond to that?
Was he upset?

17:11.040 --> 17:13.441
I don't know.
Maybe, a little.

17:14.240 --> 17:15.890
But that's not my fault.

17:17.240 --> 17:20.005
Look, Zack didn't do anything, okay?
I just left.

17:24.880 --> 17:26.119
Did he take his helmet off?

17:26.200 --> 17:27.201
What?

17:27.319 --> 17:29.846
When you were with him on the
trail, did he take his helmet off?

17:30.520 --> 17:32.170
Yeah, I guess.

17:32.280 --> 17:33.964
We found his
helmet and his bicycle

17:34.040 --> 17:36.361
on the trail and
his body in the ravine.

17:37.320 --> 17:38.560
So you had to
have been with him

17:38.600 --> 17:39.726
at the same
place that he died.

17:39.800 --> 17:41.120
Come on, Bella.
You were with him.

17:46.080 --> 17:47.809
Have you ever
heard of batrachotoxin?

17:47.920 --> 17:48.921
No.

17:49.000 --> 17:50.525
It's a poison
that stops the heart

17:50.600 --> 17:51.761
and makes you
look like this.

17:55.600 --> 17:57.170
What does this
have to do with me?

17:57.800 --> 17:59.484
How would I even do
something like that?

18:00.120 --> 18:01.121
You're free
to check my gear.

18:01.200 --> 18:04.170
If you guys think I have whatever
that poison is, then go ahead.

18:04.760 --> 18:07.491
Take a look.
That's my bike right there.

18:12.240 --> 18:13.651
Well, that won't
be necessary.

18:14.520 --> 18:16.409
If you think of anything,
give us a call.

18:29.520 --> 18:31.124
She didn't Woge?
Nope.

18:31.200 --> 18:34.249
Well, she seemed pretty upset.
Is she Wesen or not?

18:35.040 --> 18:36.963
Well, if she is,
she's good at hiding it.

18:37.960 --> 18:40.640
If she is, we better find out what
kind of Wesen we're dealing with.

18:48.040 --> 18:50.240
Excuse me. Aren't you supposed
to knock before entering?

18:50.280 --> 18:52.248
He's here.
In the hotel?

18:52.840 --> 18:54.808
Closer.
Okay. Well, just...

18:54.880 --> 18:57.486
Prince Kenneth,
may I present Adalind Schade?

18:58.000 --> 18:59.331
Uh, I...

18:59.400 --> 19:02.563
So you're
the Hexenbiest mother

19:02.640 --> 19:05.007
of the child
everyone's so obsessed with.

19:06.520 --> 19:07.521
Yes.

19:07.600 --> 19:09.728
I'm here for one reason,

19:09.840 --> 19:12.320
and that's to get your
child back to the family.

19:13.200 --> 19:17.762
I understand you made contact with Mr.
Burkhardt's girlfriend.

19:19.840 --> 19:21.763
Juliette.
I did.

19:22.440 --> 19:23.566
And how did that go?

19:24.760 --> 19:26.205
Nick is a Grimm again.

19:27.960 --> 19:30.201
I was told you
took care of that.

19:30.280 --> 19:32.567
I did, but he figured
out a way to undo it.

19:33.440 --> 19:34.601
That's possible?

19:34.680 --> 19:35.761
I didn't think So.

19:35.880 --> 19:39.327
But it does explain why
Juliette is now a Hexenbiest.

19:40.080 --> 19:41.764
I want that bitch dead.

19:43.680 --> 19:45.808
Any other surprises for me?

19:51.840 --> 19:53.205
Oh.

19:53.880 --> 19:55.291
You're full of surprises.

19:57.360 --> 19:58.850
Whose child is this?

20:01.120 --> 20:02.121
Viktor's.

20:10.640 --> 20:14.406
If it's secreting
batrachotoxins through its skin,

20:14.480 --> 20:15.811
then touching is deadly.

20:15.880 --> 20:17.006
And you're saying
she didn't Woge.

20:17.080 --> 20:18.081
No.

20:18.160 --> 20:20.003
See, I was thinking it
was a Peau de la Mort,

20:20.080 --> 20:22.048
but those rascals, you
sneeze and they Woge.

20:22.120 --> 20:23.760
I think you're dealing
with a Folterseele.

20:23.800 --> 20:24.961
What is that?

20:25.040 --> 20:27.441
Well, they're kind
of classically tragic.

20:27.520 --> 20:29.204
Always beautiful,
always deadly.

20:29.320 --> 20:31.402
Really?
You think a Folterseele?

20:31.480 --> 20:33.608
They're kind of rare,
thank God,

20:33.680 --> 20:36.331
and they don't Woge
like any other Wesen.

20:36.440 --> 20:37.487
Then how do they Woge?

20:37.600 --> 20:39.807
Well, it's not
an emotional response.

20:39.880 --> 20:42.008
It's more of a physical,
sexual one.

20:42.160 --> 20:43.764
So, like,
when they're aroused?

20:43.840 --> 20:45.251
Mmm...
It's not them.

20:45.320 --> 20:47.322
It's whoever's turned on by them.
It's a defense mechanism.

20:47.400 --> 20:49.880
Yeah, an extremely offensive
defense mechanism.

20:50.440 --> 20:51.930
Well, no wonder
they're rare.

20:52.000 --> 20:53.843
That sounds like the
old Frog Prince story.

20:54.160 --> 20:55.764
Yeah, but you
kiss this frog,

20:55.840 --> 20:57.649
your face blows up
and you die.

20:57.760 --> 20:59.250
Wait, let me see
if I can get this straight.

20:59.360 --> 21:00.646
The only way you
can get a Folterseele

21:00.720 --> 21:02.848
to Woge is if you're
sexually attracted to her?

21:03.000 --> 21:04.684
Yeah, basically.

21:04.840 --> 21:07.491
So we can't tie her to the crime
and we can't make her Woge.

21:08.840 --> 21:10.444
Interrogation room's
not gonna work on this one.

21:10.520 --> 21:11.931
Unless you guys get
in there and one of you

21:12.040 --> 21:14.441
is, like, totally
into her, and then...

21:14.520 --> 21:15.520
Really?

21:15.560 --> 21:16.846
Well, why not?

21:16.960 --> 21:19.281
So we can't make the arrest 'cause
we don't have any evidence,

21:19.360 --> 21:22.250
and I won't know if
she's a Folterseele

21:22.320 --> 21:23.520
'cause I can't
get her to Woge.

21:23.560 --> 21:25.722
Look, if you are dealing
with the Folterseele,

21:25.800 --> 21:26.881
she's not doing
this on purpose.

21:26.960 --> 21:28.530
She's probably
trying to avoid it.

21:29.040 --> 21:30.849
A lot of men can't
control themselves

21:30.920 --> 21:32.285
around the
female Folterseele.

21:32.360 --> 21:34.362
Well, that's probably
why she keeps to herself.

21:34.480 --> 21:35.527
Exactly.

21:35.600 --> 21:37.728
So maybe you guys need to just
let this one go, you know.

21:37.800 --> 21:39.484
Let the sleeping
Folterseele lie.

21:39.560 --> 21:40.561
It could happen again.

21:41.880 --> 21:45.771
What if we, I don't know,
neutralize what's happening to her,

21:45.840 --> 21:47.760
kind of like we did
with that toad-eating lawyer?

21:47.880 --> 21:49.803
Is that possible?
Won't know till we try.

21:49.880 --> 21:50.961
Try.

21:51.240 --> 21:52.844
Okay, I'll let you
know what I find out.

22:01.440 --> 22:03.681
Have you told Viktor
the blessed news?

22:04.080 --> 22:06.321
Uh, not yet.
I was about to.

22:06.400 --> 22:10.564
Right. Well,
I'm sure he'll be thrilled.

22:13.280 --> 22:14.327
Damerov
is here, sir.

22:15.160 --> 22:16.400
Bring him in.

22:17.120 --> 22:21.011
Hopefully, he has good news about the
whereabouts of your other child.

22:27.960 --> 22:29.450
You were expecting
Prince Viktor?

22:29.520 --> 22:30.567
Yes.

22:31.200 --> 22:34.329
He's been recalled.
I'm Kenneth.

22:35.080 --> 22:36.844
I've heard a lot
about you, Sam.

22:37.400 --> 22:39.528
Have you found Kelly Burkhardt
or Adalind's child?

22:39.600 --> 22:42.206
Not yet,
but I've made progress.

22:42.280 --> 22:43.645
Progress?

22:44.520 --> 22:45.760
Is that what's
in the briefcase?

22:45.840 --> 22:47.001
Yes.

22:51.640 --> 22:54.769
We know that she sold
the truck in Spokane.

22:54.880 --> 22:57.690
We believe she's still
in the area with the child.

23:00.000 --> 23:02.970
You know, the problem with
being a double agent, Sam,

23:04.080 --> 23:06.890
is that you never really know
where your loyalties lie.

23:07.320 --> 23:09.721
I work for the family, sir.

23:10.600 --> 23:12.045
Not anymore.

23:18.000 --> 23:19.365
Aah!

23:24.360 --> 23:26.249
I'm a little more
hands-on than Viktor,

23:26.320 --> 23:29.847
who, I'm sorry
to say, is sterile.

23:31.840 --> 23:34.684
So you might want to
rethink who the father is.

23:41.480 --> 23:42.811
Hey, Bella.

23:42.880 --> 23:44.166
Sorry, Ricky,
we're closing.

23:45.360 --> 23:47.124
I didn't come
about my bike.

23:48.360 --> 23:49.407
You heard about Zack?

23:50.520 --> 23:52.010
I can't believe it.

23:52.520 --> 23:53.601
You doing okay?

23:55.040 --> 23:56.371
Yeah. Thanks.

23:57.520 --> 24:00.410
You know, Zack was
pretty stupid about you.

24:01.120 --> 24:02.770
What are you talking about?

24:02.840 --> 24:05.121
You're telling me you didn't
know he was in love with you?

24:05.200 --> 24:06.884
Look, I just want to
be left alone, okay?

24:08.880 --> 24:12.202
But he was never good
enough for you, was he?

24:12.720 --> 24:14.927
You gotta go.
I gotta lock up.

24:15.040 --> 24:16.530
It's too bad about Zack.

24:16.640 --> 24:18.847
He was always
watching your back.

24:21.200 --> 24:22.361
And such a nice back.

24:24.080 --> 24:25.445
Get out.

24:25.520 --> 24:28.364
You're a stuck-up bitch who thinks
she's too good for anybody.

24:28.440 --> 24:29.487
Ricky, what are you doing?

24:29.560 --> 24:31.483
Zack was an okay guy,
and now he's dead,

24:31.560 --> 24:32.891
and I think
it's because of you,

24:32.960 --> 24:35.167
so I came to get
what you never gave him.

24:41.640 --> 24:43.642
No, no, no! You don't
know what's gonna happen.

24:43.720 --> 24:44.960
Yeah, I do.

24:52.240 --> 24:53.605
What the hell?

25:01.920 --> 25:03.081
What are you?

25:13.640 --> 25:15.210
911. What's your emergency?

25:15.280 --> 25:17.009
Hurry!
You gotta get here fast!

25:17.080 --> 25:18.764
He's dying, and
I don't know what to do!

25:32.160 --> 25:35.209
Juliette, where the hell are you?
Just answer your damn phone.

26:05.000 --> 26:06.331
Nick?

26:15.560 --> 26:16.561
Juliette.

26:16.640 --> 26:17.846
I need to get
some of my stuff.

26:18.920 --> 26:20.968
What, so you're just
moving out?

26:23.320 --> 26:24.640
I was hoping you
wouldn't be home.

26:29.560 --> 26:31.085
Look, can we
talk about this?

26:33.200 --> 26:37.046
There's really nothing you or
anybody else can say or do.

26:38.680 --> 26:40.250
This is who I am.

26:40.320 --> 26:41.360
Juliette,
this is my fault.

26:41.400 --> 26:43.720
And if there was anything I
could do to change it, I would.

26:44.000 --> 26:45.206
I know that.

26:45.640 --> 26:46.846
I haven't given up yet.

26:48.440 --> 26:49.566
Why not?

26:49.640 --> 26:50.687
Because I love you.

26:56.920 --> 26:59.366
That's great.
That's really great.

27:00.880 --> 27:02.080
Juliette...

27:04.960 --> 27:06.007
Answer it.

27:06.800 --> 27:08.131
Come on, Nick.
There's a lot of big,

27:08.200 --> 27:09.531
scary Wesen on
the loose in Portland.

27:09.600 --> 27:12.604
That's what you're good at.
Go get 'em, Grimm.

27:24.360 --> 27:25.566
Hank.

27:26.880 --> 27:28.086
Where?

27:28.320 --> 27:31.688
This is Rick Thornton, one
of the guys from the cycling club.

27:31.760 --> 27:33.760
Wouldn't be able to
tell from looking at him.

27:34.200 --> 27:36.043
Who called 911?

27:36.120 --> 27:37.963
Came from the shop phone,
woman's voice.

27:38.040 --> 27:41.761
No identity was given. Call ended
eight seconds after it was made.

27:41.840 --> 27:42.841
We think that was Bella?

27:42.920 --> 27:44.490
That's what I'm thinking.

27:44.600 --> 27:45.720
You run a background on her?

27:45.920 --> 27:48.605
I did. She's clean.
Not even a traffic ticket.

27:48.960 --> 27:50.325
Anyone else on the premises?

27:50.400 --> 27:51.731
No, not when
we got here.

27:51.840 --> 27:54.002
Shop was unlocked.
Alarm had not been set.

27:54.080 --> 27:56.128
We contacted the owner.
He was at home.

27:56.240 --> 27:57.480
Got here about
five minutes ago.

27:57.560 --> 27:59.085
All right,
let's talk to him.

28:01.920 --> 28:03.081
What time did
you close up tonight?

28:03.240 --> 28:05.811
I didn't. I left early.
Bella stayed late.

28:05.880 --> 28:07.689
She was supposed
to close up.

28:07.760 --> 28:10.650
Those are her keys on
the floor over there.

28:13.920 --> 28:14.967
Is that guy really dead?

28:16.440 --> 28:17.566
I'm afraid so.

28:19.640 --> 28:20.880
Bella's not
back there, is she?

28:20.960 --> 28:22.121
No.

28:22.280 --> 28:24.851
I tried to get ahold
of her as soon as I heard.

28:24.920 --> 28:27.161
She's not answering.
I'm really worried about her.

28:27.880 --> 28:29.370
Do you have
Bella's home address?

28:29.520 --> 28:30.965
Yeah.
Yeah, I got it on my phone.

28:37.120 --> 28:39.646
Bella, it's the police.
We need you to open up.

28:42.240 --> 28:43.571
Bella.

28:50.520 --> 28:52.363
Clear.
Bedroom clear.

28:53.720 --> 28:55.404
I got some photos.

28:57.960 --> 28:59.644
That's a nasty scar.

29:00.600 --> 29:02.841
Looks like some kind of burn.

29:04.320 --> 29:06.004
Could that be her mother?

29:06.640 --> 29:08.404
I think we
ought to find out.

29:14.080 --> 29:15.764
It's about time.
How'd it go?

29:15.840 --> 29:17.524
I gave them the information.

29:18.160 --> 29:20.208
Did they replace Viktor?
They did.

29:23.800 --> 29:26.326
Prince Kenneth
is now in charge.

29:26.480 --> 29:27.766
Kenneth?

29:28.680 --> 29:30.011
I know of him.
I just don't know much

29:30.120 --> 29:31.406
about his branch
of the family.

29:31.560 --> 29:33.210
We shouldn't
underestimate him.

29:33.560 --> 29:36.404
I got the impression
he doesn't have much patience.

29:37.080 --> 29:39.447
He wants Kelly Burkhardt
and the child.

29:39.840 --> 29:42.525
I'm gonna need to deliver
something real soon.

29:43.400 --> 29:45.129
Well, I'll come up
with something.

29:45.200 --> 29:46.884
No, we can't keep stalling.

29:47.280 --> 29:49.328
If he finds out
I'm working for you,

29:51.360 --> 29:52.441
I'm dead.

29:53.040 --> 29:55.566
I'm not sure we should even be
talking about this on the phone.

29:55.640 --> 29:57.051
Well, then come
to my office.

29:57.120 --> 30:00.681
No, it's too dangerous now.
I don't trust them.

30:01.160 --> 30:02.685
And they probably
don't trust me.

30:03.040 --> 30:04.201
All right, then where?

30:04.320 --> 30:06.402
I told them I was going back
to Spokane tonight.

30:06.520 --> 30:08.329
Meet me at the

30:08.400 --> 30:09.765
Willamette paper mill.

30:13.120 --> 30:14.406
At 9200.

30:15.400 --> 30:16.526
You better have something

30:16.600 --> 30:18.170
I can give them by then.

30:18.240 --> 30:20.129
It's my life on the line here.

30:20.560 --> 30:22.085
Don't screw with me.

30:22.720 --> 30:24.370
You'll regret it.

30:31.520 --> 30:32.601
Bravo.

30:34.920 --> 30:36.604
I think we're good here.

31:25.840 --> 31:28.764
Got something interesting
here on Bella's mom.

31:28.840 --> 31:31.525
Police report from 1989.

31:31.640 --> 31:33.563
Cindy Turner was
victim of a rape.

31:33.800 --> 31:35.848
That's her?
No scarring.

31:35.960 --> 31:38.122
Well, the picture
was taken 24 years ago.

31:38.200 --> 31:39.320
Same night she was attacked.

31:39.400 --> 31:42.324
Suspect William Ashford
attacked victim Cindy Turner

31:42.400 --> 31:45.643
outside Spackle's Bar and
Grill, but died at the scene.

31:46.080 --> 31:47.525
No charges filed
against Turner.

31:47.880 --> 31:49.928
All right. Well,
let's find out how he died.

31:51.000 --> 31:52.240
Whoa.

31:52.320 --> 31:53.401
That looks familiar.

31:53.480 --> 31:55.005
He died the same
way our vics died.

31:55.160 --> 31:57.049
Bella and her mom
have got to be the same.

31:58.040 --> 32:00.088
Ashford's death
was ruled accidental.

32:00.480 --> 32:03.086
"Cause of death,
severe allergic reaction.

32:03.160 --> 32:04.764
"Substance unknown."

32:06.440 --> 32:08.841
Rosalee. I think we've got
something that might work,

32:08.920 --> 32:11.571
but no guarantees.
It's never been tried.

32:11.880 --> 32:14.929
What I think we have to do
is depolarize her membranes

32:15.000 --> 32:18.288
by either using a
tetrodotoxin or a saxitoxin,

32:18.360 --> 32:20.124
both of which
should have antagonistic

32:20.200 --> 32:21.884
effects to
the poison she secretes.

32:22.200 --> 32:23.645
This would allow
us to block her

32:23.720 --> 32:25.131
from creating the poison
in the first place.

32:25.200 --> 32:26.247
Any side effects?

32:26.520 --> 32:29.126
Yeah, these are some hardcore
toxins we're dealing with here.

32:29.200 --> 32:30.611
I can't imagine
there wouldn't be,

32:30.680 --> 32:32.011
and probably not
very good ones.

32:32.080 --> 32:35.129
But it's better than her being
out there killing people.

32:35.200 --> 32:37.040
Hey, it's not
like she's got a choice.

32:37.080 --> 32:38.889
Do it. Gotta go.

32:39.440 --> 32:41.761
Got a DMV on
Bella's mom, Cindy Turner.

32:41.840 --> 32:44.081
The address on her
license is in Gresham.

32:44.160 --> 32:45.446
Let's go.

32:45.720 --> 32:49.202
Bella? I saw your bike.
What are you doing here?

32:49.320 --> 32:50.321
Mom.

32:50.400 --> 32:51.686
What's wrong, honey?

32:51.760 --> 32:54.889
It happened again,
but it wasn't my fault.

32:55.480 --> 32:59.087
He attacked me, and I told
him to leave me alone.

33:00.080 --> 33:01.684
It's okay. It's okay.

33:01.760 --> 33:05.651
It's not okay, Mom. The police
are gonna think that I did it.

33:05.720 --> 33:07.563
It doesn't matter
what the police think.

33:08.160 --> 33:09.491
I can't go back there.

33:09.560 --> 33:10.891
You don't have to.

33:11.600 --> 33:15.685
Look, I'm gonna go back to the
house, get you something to eat.

33:16.440 --> 33:18.124
You just rest. Hmm?

33:20.400 --> 33:22.084
I'll take care
of everything.

33:35.080 --> 33:36.127
No.

33:37.680 --> 33:39.364
No, you don't.

33:43.880 --> 33:44.961
What happened?

33:45.280 --> 33:46.361
Nothing.

33:46.440 --> 33:47.441
Don't lie to me.

33:47.520 --> 33:48.806
It's not her fault, Mom.

33:48.920 --> 33:51.161
It doesn't matter.
It has to be done.

33:51.240 --> 33:52.401
No.

33:52.480 --> 33:53.606
It's for her own good.

33:56.360 --> 33:58.567
I will not do
this to my daughter.

33:58.720 --> 33:59.960
You won't have to.

34:08.159 --> 34:09.446
I will.

34:54.920 --> 34:56.445
Hey, forget knocking.
There's a woman on the floor.

34:56.520 --> 34:57.646
She's not moving.

35:04.640 --> 35:06.642
She's got blood on
the back of her head.

35:07.560 --> 35:08.686
All right,
she's got a pulse.

35:08.760 --> 35:09.761
I'm calling an ambulance.

35:11.080 --> 35:12.241
Bella.

35:12.680 --> 35:14.091
It's okay. We're police.

35:14.320 --> 35:15.446
You don't understand.

35:15.520 --> 35:16.931
My mother's with her.

35:18.480 --> 35:20.050
It's for your own good!

35:20.760 --> 35:22.171
Unless you want
to keep on killing!

35:22.240 --> 35:23.651
No!

35:23.720 --> 35:26.451
Do you want to be raped
like your mother and me?

35:26.560 --> 35:28.164
No, Grandma! No!

35:28.280 --> 35:30.203
You do what we all have to do.
Please! No!

35:30.280 --> 35:32.203
It's for your own good.
No! No! No!

35:33.040 --> 35:34.690
Police!
No.

35:34.760 --> 35:35.966
No!

35:40.400 --> 35:41.731
Thank God.

35:43.560 --> 35:44.925
You think you saved her?

35:46.520 --> 35:48.568
Oh, you haven't saved
her from anything.

35:48.680 --> 35:51.251
Well maybe we have.
You need to come with us.

35:51.720 --> 35:53.643
It's not her fault.
You can't arrest her.

35:53.760 --> 35:55.046
We know.

35:56.200 --> 35:58.089
There might
be another way.

36:00.720 --> 36:01.960
If you drink this,

36:02.040 --> 36:04.930
we believe it will keep your
touch from killing anyone.

36:07.280 --> 36:08.520
And you're sure
it'll work?

36:09.120 --> 36:10.167
No.

36:11.080 --> 36:14.084
It's never been tried. Or if it
has been, there's no record.

36:14.680 --> 36:17.604
Usually, that means
not such a good outcome.

36:18.040 --> 36:20.691
It may affect you in ways we
have no way of predicting.

36:20.760 --> 36:23.923
Not exactly, uh,
FDA approved, you know?

36:25.280 --> 36:28.682
Look, I know a thing
or two about side effects.

36:32.440 --> 36:33.840
You really want to
think about this.

36:37.480 --> 36:42.202
You don't know what it's like to
never be able to experience love.

36:46.280 --> 36:51.127
Never feel the touch of another
person or be able to touch them.

36:54.520 --> 36:55.920
I don't care about
the side effects.

36:58.240 --> 37:00.288
It can't be worse
than what happens now.

37:58.360 --> 37:59.407
Sam?

38:14.360 --> 38:15.361
Sam?

38:30.520 --> 38:32.249
Sean Renard.

38:34.480 --> 38:35.766
We haven't met.

38:36.720 --> 38:37.881
I'm Kenneth.

38:39.000 --> 38:41.002
Did you kill him?
I did.

38:41.600 --> 38:42.931
But he sort of
had it coming,

38:43.560 --> 38:45.483
trying to trick
the family into believing

38:45.560 --> 38:47.642
he knew where Kelly Burkhardt
and the child were.

38:49.800 --> 38:51.086
Well, I should arrest you.

38:51.240 --> 38:54.926
Well, my confession is just
between the two of us.

38:56.240 --> 39:00.086
The King is extremely annoyed
with how things have progressed.

39:00.160 --> 39:02.367
He desperately
wants his granddaughter.

39:02.440 --> 39:05.410
And I've been tasked with the
responsibility of making that happen.

39:05.920 --> 39:07.331
There's no need for guns.

39:07.400 --> 39:09.323
Nobody's going
to shoot anybody.

39:09.840 --> 39:12.923
If I wanted you dead,
you'd be dead.

39:21.320 --> 39:25.689
So, this is when you tell me how
important lam to the family

39:25.800 --> 39:27.689
and that we
should join forces.

39:29.280 --> 39:30.327
No.

39:59.880 --> 40:01.644
Going there, are we?

40:37.760 --> 40:42.243
This is where I tell you how
important lam to the family.

40:43.000 --> 40:45.162
And unless you
join forces with me,

40:45.240 --> 40:47.368
you'll end up like
your friend Damerov.

40:51.960 --> 40:56.124
And the King will mourn
the loss of another son.

40:59.240 --> 41:00.810
Think about it.

41:20.520 --> 41:23.171
3 weeks later...

41:24.400 --> 41:27.051
...at a nice restaurant...

41:27.880 --> 41:30.565
...somewhere in The Pearl.

41:33.640 --> 41:37.087
I always think that these
first dates are so awkward.

41:38.200 --> 41:41.682
You never know what to
say or what not to say,

41:41.760 --> 41:43.762
what someone's
gonna like or not like.

41:47.760 --> 41:51.924
And I guess I'm just trying really
hard not to sound like an idiot.

41:53.160 --> 41:54.605
I really like you.

41:55.200 --> 41:57.089
I really like you, too.

42:01.880 --> 42:05.282
So, are you sure you're not
bothered by the way I look?

42:07.280 --> 42:08.884
I think you're a knockout.
