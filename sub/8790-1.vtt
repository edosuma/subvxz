<i>They wonder why those
of us in our twenties</i>

00:25.484 --> 00:28.158
<i>refuse to work an 80-hour week</i>

00:28.237 --> 00:30.956
<i>just so we can afford
to buy their BMWs,</i>

00:31.990 --> 00:35.995
<i>why we aren't interested in the
counterculture that they invented,</i>

00:36.078 --> 00:39.127
<i>as if we did not see them
disembowel their revolution</i>

00:39.206 --> 00:40.924
<i>for a pair of running shoes.</i>

00:41.041 --> 00:43.840
<i>- Whoo! Yeah!
- But the question remains,</i>

00:44.503 --> 00:46.551
<i>what are we going to do now?</i>

00:46.880 --> 00:50.635
<i>How can we repair all the
damage we inherited?</i>

00:51.301 --> 00:54.350
Fellow graduates,
the answer is simple.

00:55.222 --> 00:56.815
The answer is...

01:06.483 --> 01:08.156
The answer is...

01:08.694 --> 01:10.162
I don't know.

01:19.830 --> 01:22.049
Good save, Lelaina.

01:23.083 --> 01:26.053
I'm not a Valedictorian,
but I play one on TV.

01:26.211 --> 01:29.010
We all know you slept
your way to the podium.

01:35.345 --> 01:38.269
My favorite part about
graduating now will be

01:38.473 --> 01:41.226
dodging my student loan officer
for the rest of my life.

01:41.393 --> 01:44.897
He will be in cahoots with the
Columbia Record and Tape Company guy.

01:44.980 --> 01:47.108
Been after my ass for years.

01:48.108 --> 01:51.533
Troy Dyer. Brought
you back a souvenir.

01:51.695 --> 01:54.995
You could still go back
next year and graduate,

01:55.073 --> 01:57.292
- still get your BFA.
- Oh, can I?

01:57.367 --> 02:01.292
And then I can hang this
on my rearview mirror

02:01.371 --> 02:04.545
to brag to all my good buddies
back home that I graduated.

02:04.625 --> 02:07.549
Well, I'm through with
the whole wank-a-rama.

02:10.380 --> 02:13.259
Well, I know this sounds
cornball, but, um,

02:14.343 --> 02:17.813
I'd like to somehow make a
difference in people's lives.

02:20.057 --> 02:23.607
And I... I would like to
buy them all a Coke.

02:24.603 --> 02:27.698
And you wonder why we
never got involved.

02:27.773 --> 02:29.775
Three words, November 16, 199...

02:29.900 --> 02:33.120
- Oh, totally drunk.
- It would have been a poetic experience,

02:33.195 --> 02:35.197
if I weren't such a gentleman.

02:35.280 --> 02:38.250
Just let it go, Dyer.
Surrender the fantasy.

02:39.743 --> 02:42.166
Hey, Sammy, what's your goal?

02:42.579 --> 02:44.627
My goal is to...

02:45.582 --> 02:47.801
I'd like a career or something.

02:55.926 --> 02:58.930
I think the moment has been
appropriately captured.

02:59.012 --> 03:02.061
Could you please take your
face out of the camera?

03:02.140 --> 03:04.108
Come on. It's for my documentary.

03:04.184 --> 03:08.815
Her documentary.

03:11.942 --> 03:13.319
Think fast.

03:19.282 --> 03:20.625
Here's the deal.

03:20.701 --> 03:23.329
I'm gonna take Sam against his will

03:23.620 --> 03:24.837
and straighten him out,

03:24.913 --> 03:28.133
because I believe if we can get
two women on the Supreme Court,

03:28.291 --> 03:30.965
we can get at least
one on you, Sam.

03:32.671 --> 03:36.847
I'm Superman. I can fly.

03:36.925 --> 03:38.427
She's toasted.

03:39.469 --> 03:41.221
Quick, Vickie, what's
your Social Security?

03:41.304 --> 03:44.854
Uh, 851-25-9357.

03:45.392 --> 03:46.985
Very impressive.

03:47.477 --> 03:50.606
It's the only thing
I really learned in college.

03:53.191 --> 03:56.657
Sometimes I get that
not-so-fresh feeling.

03:57.696 --> 04:01.291
<i>Conjunction junction
What's your function?</i>

04:01.366 --> 04:04.961
<i>Hookin' up words and
phrases and clauses</i>

04:05.662 --> 04:09.132
<i>Conjunction junction
How's that function?</i>

04:09.207 --> 04:11.084
<i>I got three favorite cars</i>

04:11.168 --> 04:13.341
<i>They get most of my job done</i>

04:28.185 --> 04:30.984
Honey, honey. Let me
do it for you. No, no.

04:40.614 --> 04:43.788
- Is yours good?
- I don't think it's very fresh.

04:43.867 --> 04:45.210
I'm sorry.

04:50.874 --> 04:55.300
Well, I guess it's about time for me
to give you your graduation present.

04:57.839 --> 05:00.888
- Your gas card.
- I'll pay that bill for one year.

05:01.259 --> 05:04.559
And since Helen Anne's got
herself a brand-new Infiniti,

05:04.638 --> 05:07.016
we're gonna give you her old BMW.

05:07.224 --> 05:08.646
You pick it up at our house.

05:09.392 --> 05:12.838
- BMW? BMW!
- Yeah.

05:12.864 --> 05:15.967
Tom, didn't you listen
to her speech today?

05:16.024 --> 05:17.776
She doesn't want a BMW.

05:17.859 --> 05:20.487
- Mom, I'll handle this.
- I'm not gonna sit here

05:20.570 --> 05:24.315
and listen to some strange ethical
argument about a damn car.

05:24.574 --> 05:26.247
It's got four wheels. It runs well.

05:26.326 --> 05:30.126
After you've been in the real world,
you're gonna appreciate that car.

05:30.539 --> 05:34.385
Just think of all those starving children
in Africa that don't even have cars.

05:34.459 --> 05:36.799
Troy, does your father
give you gifts like that?

05:36.825 --> 05:37.784
Mom!

05:38.547 --> 05:42.768
My father's dying of prostate cancer,
so I don't trouble him much for gifts.

05:47.138 --> 05:49.015
- See, Tom?
- Hmm?

05:49.099 --> 05:51.193
You don't want a BMW.
Tell him, Lelaina!

05:51.268 --> 05:54.397
Charlane, she can
make up her own mind.

05:54.938 --> 05:58.738
Dad, don't talk to her that
way. She's not a child.

05:59.276 --> 06:00.994
Well, she married one.

06:02.779 --> 06:03.871
What?

06:05.282 --> 06:08.161
All right. Excuse me. Come on.

06:08.952 --> 06:13.458
Mom, Dad, I'll take the BMW, until I
can afford to buy a regular car, okay?

06:14.124 --> 06:16.126
Okay, Mom? Please?

06:17.460 --> 06:19.337
Mom, please? Come on.

06:28.346 --> 06:29.768
Get a Ford.

06:58.960 --> 07:02.180
<i>Just afloat on the sea</i>

07:03.340 --> 07:07.891
<i>Find myself on a page of history</i>

07:09.846 --> 07:12.520
<i>You know as I ride along</i>

07:12.682 --> 07:15.652
<i>I can always hear the song</i>

07:15.810 --> 07:17.312
<i>About you</i>

07:17.687 --> 07:20.861
<i>And where you're meant to be</i>

07:22.901 --> 07:25.700
<i>Well, you're gonna
tell me the answers</i>

07:26.112 --> 07:29.491
<i>I'll know when you come back to me</i>

07:41.711 --> 07:43.304
<i>If we should fall</i>

07:43.463 --> 07:46.717
<i>Love will catch us every time</i>

07:47.842 --> 07:50.686
<i>I hear you call I will run</i>

07:52.973 --> 07:58.355
<i>And if the magic of the
adventure overcomes</i>

07:58.645 --> 08:00.488
<i>We won't cry</i>

08:00.814 --> 08:03.408
<i>Because it could be fun</i>

08:05.819 --> 08:08.663
<i>Well, I'm gonna tell
you the answers</i>

08:08.905 --> 08:13.081
<i>You'll know when you
come back to me</i>

08:29.384 --> 08:33.934
<i>Gonna be all right</i>

08:34.764 --> 08:37.267
<i>When you come back to me</i>

09:19.225 --> 09:20.226
Good morning.

09:20.310 --> 09:22.153
Good morning!

09:24.606 --> 09:27.610
Yes, good morning,
ladies and gentleman!

09:27.692 --> 09:31.162
I see a gentleman right
over there! Good morning!

09:31.821 --> 09:33.664
Good morning! Boy, I tell ya,

09:33.823 --> 09:36.497
it is a good morning
with this audience.

09:37.368 --> 09:41.839
Today for all you dieters, guiltless
goodies from Chef Skinny Ninny!

09:41.915 --> 09:44.259
Ho-ho. Mmm.

09:45.210 --> 09:48.805
And we'll also be visiting with
a man right here from Houston

09:49.089 --> 09:51.933
- who is battling Alzheimer's.
- Aww.

09:52.217 --> 09:57.314
A beautiful and touching story of
the triumph of the human spirit.

09:57.806 --> 10:00.650
He's so cheesy I can't watch
him without crackers.

10:01.017 --> 10:05.989
Now let's take a peek inside our Video
View and see what we have in store today.

10:09.067 --> 10:13.038
It's a special report on
children's birthday party themes.

10:13.530 --> 10:17.000
Taped on location at eight-year-old
Davey Robbins' party

10:17.075 --> 10:20.295
exclusively for our
Video View collection.

10:23.206 --> 10:25.959
So come sit with me.

10:27.043 --> 10:29.922
Relax. Have a cup of joe.

10:31.256 --> 10:33.634
Oh, shit! Oh, shit!

10:35.718 --> 10:39.188
Well, anyway, it's gonna be
a good day, good morning.

10:39.264 --> 10:42.484
You're beautiful!

10:48.022 --> 10:49.740
Clear!

10:53.820 --> 10:57.495
Am I here to amuse you, Ms. Pierce?
Is that the reason I'm on this show?

10:57.574 --> 11:00.578
I put on your note card
to get your own expresso.

11:00.660 --> 11:02.662
Didn't you get my
"espress yourself" memo?

11:02.745 --> 11:06.875
I don't have time for your games.
We're laying people off around here.

11:06.958 --> 11:10.679
I can find an intern who'll do
your job for free, like that.

11:19.304 --> 11:21.181
<i>I been locked out</i>

11:21.556 --> 11:23.354
<i>I been locked in</i>

11:23.600 --> 11:26.774
<i>But I always seem
to come back again</i>

11:27.478 --> 11:30.527
<i>And the view when I look
through my window...</i>

11:30.607 --> 11:32.735
That's a much better size.
That looks great.

11:33.318 --> 11:35.195
That would go with the Easy Fits.

11:35.278 --> 11:38.782
So... Oh, buttoning it up.
That's even better. Okay.

11:42.452 --> 11:45.956
Yeah! Roll 'em right up.
It's liberating, isn't it?

11:50.293 --> 11:53.297
<i>I bought a toothbrush
Some toothpaste</i>

11:53.379 --> 11:55.723
<i>A flannel for my face</i>

11:55.798 --> 11:58.096
<i>Pajamas, a hair brush</i>

11:58.176 --> 12:00.554
<i>New shoes and a case</i>

12:00.637 --> 12:02.731
<i>I said to my reflection</i>

12:02.805 --> 12:06.560
<i>Let's get out of this place</i>

12:07.810 --> 12:10.484
<i>Passed the church and the steeple</i>

12:10.730 --> 12:12.858
<i>The laundry on the hill</i>

12:12.941 --> 12:16.286
<i>Murders, there's one
committed each seven seconds</i>

12:16.361 --> 12:17.453
<i>How do you know...</i>

12:17.487 --> 12:21.367
- Hello? I got cut off. I'm sorry.
<i>- What the hell happened?</i>

12:21.824 --> 12:24.748
<i>Tempted by the fruit of another</i>

12:26.663 --> 12:29.963
Hello? What?

12:30.333 --> 12:33.928
<i>Tempted but the truth is discovered</i>

12:34.420 --> 12:38.300
<i>What's been goin' on
Now that you have gone</i>

12:38.508 --> 12:40.977
No, no, listen. He needs us.

12:41.052 --> 12:44.727
He makes videos. We show
them, okay? It's symbiotic.

12:44.806 --> 12:48.026
It's like the chicken or the egg,
both of them working together...

12:48.142 --> 12:51.772
Well, I'm not scared of him.

12:52.355 --> 12:54.357
No, no, I'm not scared of...

12:54.524 --> 12:57.277
Jesus!

12:57.860 --> 12:59.282
<i>Michael, don't laugh at me.</i>

12:59.529 --> 13:01.406
What? No!

13:01.489 --> 13:03.787
I'm in an accident.
I got in an accident.

13:04.200 --> 13:06.043
<i>You okay?</i>

13:06.119 --> 13:08.542
Yeah. No. I'll call you back.

13:09.580 --> 13:13.255
- When you say "sue..."
- It's not really my idea.

13:13.334 --> 13:16.178
I got my lawyer telling me
something about my rates...

13:16.587 --> 13:20.637
Right. You mean like sue
in a courtroom for money?

13:20.883 --> 13:23.636
I don't know. I've never done
anything like this before.

13:23.761 --> 13:24.849
Do you have a lawyer?

13:24.875 --> 13:27.381
No, I don't have a lawyer.
I don't have a dentist.

13:27.432 --> 13:30.402
I'm... You know,
I make $400 a week.

13:31.561 --> 13:32.562
What do you do?

13:32.603 --> 13:34.856
At the moment, I'm working...

13:34.939 --> 13:37.192
I'm sorry. I just... I gotta...

13:40.361 --> 13:41.783
Hello?

13:43.489 --> 13:47.960
Yeah, what is it? I don't care if
she does 12 books of herself naked.

13:48.036 --> 13:50.915
It doesn't... That's Dr. Zaius
from <i>Planet of the Apes.</i>

13:51.205 --> 13:54.254
- Oh!
- I'm sorry. Someone else is in here.

13:55.168 --> 13:57.717
Yeah? Well, let her say that to me.

13:58.004 --> 13:59.927
- No, don't do that.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

14:00.590 --> 14:03.594
No, no, you can... I was...
Go ahead. You want to touch it?

14:03.676 --> 14:06.475
- Me?
- Yeah, go ahead. No, I was talking to...

14:06.554 --> 14:10.434
Can I talk to you later?
Can we... What? Okay.

14:10.600 --> 14:13.774
Um... Okay.

14:13.853 --> 14:15.105
Um, uh...

14:16.731 --> 14:19.359
You know what? Just forget it.

14:20.109 --> 14:21.281
Really. Just forget
the whole thing.

14:21.361 --> 14:25.741
It was probably my fault anyway, and
I'll get in trouble, and I don't...

14:26.282 --> 14:29.627
You seem very sweet, and you
seem to like Dr. Zaius.

14:29.994 --> 14:32.122
Oh.

14:34.374 --> 14:35.626
That's...

14:37.001 --> 14:37.677
Oh, I...

14:37.703 --> 14:40.405
That's... He was just a
collector's... No big...

14:40.797 --> 14:44.643
- Um, well, here's... Here's his head.
- You know what? It's really...

14:45.051 --> 14:47.179
You know, I think he's gone.

14:48.388 --> 14:50.732
- Yeah.
- I'm, like, ruining your whole life here.

14:50.807 --> 14:52.901
No, you're not, really.

14:52.975 --> 14:56.980
Just don't touch anything else,
and I think we'll be fine.

14:58.356 --> 15:01.656
Michael Grates, Vice President
Regional Programming,

15:01.734 --> 15:03.202
<i>In Your Face TV.</i>

15:03.277 --> 15:05.780
We've seen it. It's like
MTV, but with an edge.

15:05.863 --> 15:08.082
- So is it a date?
- Yeah. Yep.

15:08.157 --> 15:09.830
- Dinner?
- Coffee.

15:09.909 --> 15:12.958
- Coffee or cappuccino?
- Oh, he ended up saying "decaf."

15:13.204 --> 15:15.878
Oh, no. Early night. Is there
any pre-coffee activity?

15:15.998 --> 15:19.844
- I don't think so.
- Did he ask you to go out or to hang out?

15:20.002 --> 15:23.006
- Go out. He definitely said go out.
- Hey. How ya doin'?

15:23.172 --> 15:25.641
- Oh, shit.
- What?

15:25.716 --> 15:27.514
I forgot to tell you something.

15:27.844 --> 15:32.441
- Are you out of your mind?
- He just got fired from the newsstand.

15:32.515 --> 15:35.735
He needs a place to stay
until he can find a new job.

15:35.935 --> 15:39.235
Vickie, that's the American dream
of the '90s. That could take years.

15:39.522 --> 15:43.618
Look at it like a built-in security
system. We'll have a man around.

15:43.693 --> 15:48.290
We'll have a hall monitor. I don't even
know if this is allowed in the building.

15:48.364 --> 15:52.585
It's not like Mr. Roper's gonna
burst in. I'll just stay on the couch.

15:52.660 --> 15:57.882
Vickie, he will turn this
place into a den of slack.

15:59.542 --> 16:01.715
What the hell is your problem?

16:02.545 --> 16:05.469
I have to work, and
unfortunately, Troy,

16:05.548 --> 16:08.142
you are a master at the
art of time suckage.

16:08.217 --> 16:10.766
Well, Miss Poster Girl
for The Workers Party,

16:10.887 --> 16:14.687
until I get that toehold in the
burger industry, I got time to suck.

16:14.765 --> 16:17.188
I'd rather check into a shelter.

16:17.518 --> 16:21.148
I know how much you'd love
to mainline misery here,

16:21.355 --> 16:24.529
but I can get you an
interview at my dad's plant.

16:25.693 --> 16:29.323
- Is that part of my lease agreement?
- That or a credit check.

16:29.405 --> 16:31.908
It's cool, Troy. You can stay.

16:32.241 --> 16:35.620
- Welcome to the maxi-pad.
- Yeah, with the new Dri-Weave.

16:35.703 --> 16:38.957
It actually pulls moisture
away from you. It's good.

16:40.833 --> 16:42.835
You won't even know I'm here.

16:44.587 --> 16:46.510
<i>Well, should I get married
Should I be good</i>

16:46.589 --> 16:50.093
<i>Should I astound the girl next door
with my velvet suit and Faustus hood</i>

16:50.176 --> 16:55.103
<i>Take her to cemeteries and tell her of
werewolf tongues and forked clarinets</i>

16:56.766 --> 17:00.361
What Hey, That's My Bike would
like to do eventually as a band

17:00.436 --> 17:02.734
is travel the countryside
like Woody Guthrie.

17:02.897 --> 17:04.648
Or, uh, Richard Simmons.

17:05.191 --> 17:06.909
You know how he... Commercials,

17:06.983 --> 17:08.906
he travels around,
surprises people jogging.

17:09.779 --> 17:11.827
As you can see, I have, uh,

17:12.114 --> 17:15.539
the occasional run-in with
an anti-Hey-That's-My-Biker,

17:15.617 --> 17:18.997
and to those people,
I say nobody...

17:20.289 --> 17:22.791
Nobody can eat 50 eggs.

17:24.627 --> 17:26.174
- Laney?
- What-y?

17:26.420 --> 17:29.014
The next time you make
microwave brownies,

17:29.090 --> 17:31.843
I'd really consider
using a microwave.

17:32.009 --> 17:34.387
It's just a thought.

17:34.804 --> 17:38.104
You know, I finally figured out
what your problem is, Dyer.

17:38.182 --> 17:39.855
What's that? I'm not a Pepper?

17:40.017 --> 17:43.066
You suffer from the
philosopher-groupie syndrome.

17:43.145 --> 17:47.269
You're this guy with, like,
a 180 IQ, 10 units away...

17:47.348 --> 17:48.917
- from a degree in philosophy.
- Yeah?

17:48.993 --> 17:51.572
And you always fall for
these dumb groupie types.

17:51.654 --> 17:56.165
Now, they are not all dumb. Most of
them are just very, very depressed.

17:57.243 --> 17:59.666
You find me attractive,
sitting here, eating brownies?

17:59.745 --> 18:01.565
You do. You're strangely
attracted to me right now.

18:01.591 --> 18:04.514
You're oddly, oddly attracted
to me. It turns you on.

18:04.540 --> 18:07.366
- You like to watch, don't you?
- Come on! Come on! Come on!

18:10.047 --> 18:12.095
- Don't! Come on. It's not funny.
- Here we are.

18:12.258 --> 18:14.135
- Give it back.
- Give what back?

18:14.302 --> 18:15.978
- Give it back!
- Give the brownies back?

18:16.004 --> 18:20.934
Oh, brownies, brownies! Oh! Oh!
I love brownies! My name's...

18:21.017 --> 18:22.378
Hey, don't. Hey, watch the camera.

18:22.685 --> 18:24.813
<i>Don't do anything. That's not nice.</i>

18:34.363 --> 18:36.582
Mr. Gubler, um, do you have time

18:36.699 --> 18:39.703
- to take a look at what I've done here?
- I need my questions.

18:40.036 --> 18:43.586
Oh. Well, here's the research that
I did. You might want to read it,

18:43.706 --> 18:46.692
'cause this guest has quite
a history in politics.

18:46.718 --> 18:48.532
Just give me my questions.

18:59.305 --> 19:01.683
<i>Excusez-moi.</i>

19:01.849 --> 19:04.227
- Are you all alone?
- Not anymore.

19:05.770 --> 19:09.866
If I could bottle the sexual tension
between Bonnie Franklin and Schneider,

19:10.566 --> 19:12.614
I could solve the energy crisis.

19:13.069 --> 19:17.996
Excuse me. Don't
Bogart that can, man.

19:19.367 --> 19:21.745
- Are you retarded?
- No, I'm rhyming.

19:23.287 --> 19:26.461
It's not easy. I'm sure
I make it look easy.

19:28.751 --> 19:31.220
- You guys better not be inhaling.
- Hi.

19:31.295 --> 19:36.426
Lelaina, Vickie was just
promoted to manager of The Gap.

19:36.634 --> 19:39.763
- Shut up.
- It's not even a big deal.

19:40.096 --> 19:43.942
The old manager tried to kill herself
by eating a whole pot of poinsettias.

19:44.475 --> 19:48.946
- Still, I'm so proud of you!
- I'll be making $400 a week.

19:49.355 --> 19:51.904
We're never gonna have
rent problems again.

19:52.441 --> 19:54.443
Troy, aren't you excited?

19:54.694 --> 19:56.617
I'm bursting with fruit flavor.

19:56.696 --> 19:58.744
Guys, I just thought of something.

19:58.823 --> 20:04.330
I'm manager of The Gap. I'm
responsible for all those T-shirts:

20:04.578 --> 20:08.048
French cut, V-necked,
ribbed, what-have-you.

20:08.165 --> 20:09.781
Dude, I'm in trouble.

20:09.807 --> 20:12.011
No, you're not, Vick.
I know you can do it.

20:12.128 --> 20:16.133
I just do not understand why
this moment has to be Memorexed.

20:16.424 --> 20:21.646
Sammy, don't you realize? This is your
one opportunity to play a small part

20:22.054 --> 20:24.557
in what is destined
to be greatness.

20:24.932 --> 20:27.026
Laney here is gonna revolutionize

20:27.101 --> 20:31.777
<i>- Good Morning, Grant.</i>
- Oh, my God! I'm so sorry! I had no idea!

20:31.939 --> 20:34.488
Oh, yeah, look who's mocking.
All you do around here, Troy,

20:34.859 --> 20:38.534
is eat and couch and
fondle the remote control.

20:38.612 --> 20:41.741
I'm not under any orders to
make the world a better place.

20:41.824 --> 20:44.543
- Then what good are you?
- You're a pathological optimist.

20:44.618 --> 20:46.370
You're pathological.

20:46.704 --> 20:50.800
Oh, would you two just do it and
get it over with? I'm starving.

20:53.377 --> 20:55.345
Oh!

20:56.213 --> 20:59.057
Hello. You've reached the
winter of our discontent.

21:00.676 --> 21:03.520
Uh, hold on. It's some
Michael character?

21:06.974 --> 21:09.068
- Who's Michael?
- Let's order a pizza.

21:09.143 --> 21:14.024
Lelaina! If we promise to pay you
back, will you spot us a pizza?

21:14.106 --> 21:17.030
- I don't have any cash.
- Domino's takes checks.

21:17.109 --> 21:19.111
Okay, great.

21:19.361 --> 21:23.036
Okay, bye. The owner of Domino's
supports Operation Rescue.

21:23.240 --> 21:26.710
Oh, please, no one gives a shit
right now. We're starving.

21:26.786 --> 21:28.709
Oh, wait.

21:32.374 --> 21:34.877
Ta-da! We're going to eat gas.

21:39.590 --> 21:42.844
- Ah!
- Who's this Michael guy?

21:42.927 --> 21:44.224
- Um...
- Hey.

21:44.553 --> 21:46.851
- Vickie just figured something out.
- What?

21:46.931 --> 21:49.229
Something wonderful.

21:49.308 --> 21:52.312
"Evian" is "naive"
spelled backwards.

21:52.561 --> 21:55.189
Can you turn this up, please?

21:55.731 --> 21:58.405
Please? You won't be sorry.

21:59.035 --> 22:01.654
- Thank you.
<i>- Oh, my little pretty one, pretty one.</i>

22:01.737 --> 22:05.367
<i>When you gonna give me
some time, Sharona</i>

22:05.449 --> 22:08.202
<i>Ooh, you make my motor run
My motor run</i>

22:08.285 --> 22:11.664
<i>Gun it, comin' it off
of the line, Sharona</i>

22:11.747 --> 22:14.921
<i>Never gonna stop, give it up
Such a dirty mind</i>

22:15.000 --> 22:16.502
<i>- I always get it up</i>
- Come on!

22:16.585 --> 22:18.132
<i>For the touch of the younger kind</i>

22:18.212 --> 22:21.136
<i>My, my, my-y-y</i>

22:21.215 --> 22:22.637
- Whoa!
- Hey!

22:22.716 --> 22:24.684
<i>M-M-M-My Sharona</i>

22:27.972 --> 22:30.942
<i>Come a little closer, hon
I'll be your hunk</i>

22:31.267 --> 22:34.521
<i>Close enough to look
in my eyes, Sharona</i>

22:34.603 --> 22:37.698
<i>Keepin' it a mystery
You get to me</i>

22:37.773 --> 22:41.152
<i>Runnin' down the length
of my thigh, Sharona...</i>

22:41.443 --> 22:44.287
<i>Good times
Anytime you need it, baby</i>

22:44.697 --> 22:47.792
<i>Good times
Anytime you need a friend</i>

22:48.325 --> 22:51.625
Thelma's husband Keith's got
vodka hidden in the toilet.

22:51.704 --> 22:55.709
- That's a good one.
- Doom-doom. <i>James dies</i>

22:55.833 --> 22:57.674
- That's a two-parter.
- I'll allow it.

22:57.751 --> 23:00.345
- J.J. works in the chicken shop.
- We did that.

23:00.462 --> 23:03.478
We did that in the same one
where he has a cape on.

23:03.504 --> 23:04.663
Drink up, man.

23:04.800 --> 23:07.474
I hate to see that happen
to the rookie. Um...

23:08.304 --> 23:11.934
Alderman Davis judges a...
Oh, my God.

23:12.016 --> 23:15.771
- Hi.
- Are you a collection agent?

23:16.645 --> 23:17.862
Lelaina!

23:18.439 --> 23:22.319
Oh! Yeah! I'll be right there!

23:27.156 --> 23:27.908
Oh.

23:27.934 --> 23:30.918
<i>If you ain't the most hardheaded
woman I have ever seen.</i>

23:30.944 --> 23:31.606
Great.

23:31.952 --> 23:34.330
Hurry up, hurry up. Oh! It's me!
Willona dates a deaf guy.

23:34.622 --> 23:35.393
Good, good, good.

23:35.419 --> 23:37.821
How about the one where
Gary Coleman comes on.

23:37.875 --> 23:40.378
He's, like, the little... That guy?

23:42.755 --> 23:44.598
- We did that one. Go.
- It was cute.

23:44.673 --> 23:48.394
- J.J.'s prom date. Gotta go, gotta go.
- Hi.

23:48.469 --> 23:51.473
Um, every... This is Michael.

23:53.933 --> 23:56.356
You got a prom date
and a prom date...

23:56.435 --> 23:59.029
- Too late. Wait up.
- I'm gonna go.

23:59.146 --> 24:01.399
- Bye.
- Michael throws a party. Sammy, let's go.

24:01.482 --> 24:05.157
Lelaina. You know the punishment
for premature evacuation.

24:06.362 --> 24:08.205
Frank's party. Sammy Joe?

24:08.864 --> 24:11.959
Penny! Willona adopts Penny! Shit!

24:14.203 --> 24:17.082
I'm, uh, making this
documentary about my friends,

24:17.164 --> 24:20.885
but it's really about people who are
trying to find their own identity

24:20.960 --> 24:24.180
without having any real role
models or heroes or anything.

24:24.880 --> 24:28.805
Wow. That sounds great.
I mean, it seems like

24:28.884 --> 24:32.309
your friends would be perfect
for that, like that guy Troy?

24:32.388 --> 24:34.140
- Troy, yeah.
- All done here, sir?

24:34.264 --> 24:36.608
- Uh, yeah.
- You don't want to finish that?

24:36.684 --> 24:39.358
No, I'm fine. I had a late...

24:39.687 --> 24:42.987
So, uh, so Troy is... You guys just...
It's like you guys living there,

24:43.107 --> 24:45.280
- just the two of you?
- No, no, no, no. It's...

24:45.359 --> 24:49.956
It's me and Vickie, but he,
uh, got fired from his job,

24:50.030 --> 24:52.579
so he needed a place to crash
for a couple of weeks, so...

24:52.825 --> 24:58.457
- They, um, caught him stealing a Snickers.
- He stole a Snickers bar?

24:58.831 --> 25:01.209
Yeah.

25:01.542 --> 25:04.216
Somehow, he can rationalize it,

25:04.378 --> 25:07.928
like the, uh, establishment
owes him a Snickers.

25:09.091 --> 25:12.265
Right, right. Well, I mean,
I guess, you know...

25:19.643 --> 25:21.816
You know, you're very beautiful.

25:23.814 --> 25:27.068
I mean... I mean, uh,
seriously, you're...

25:29.278 --> 25:32.327
I'm, uh... I'm, uh,

25:33.282 --> 25:35.751
not really good with compliments.

25:37.661 --> 25:42.258
Um, but, uh, um...
Are you religious?

25:45.002 --> 25:47.346
Um...

25:47.463 --> 25:49.966
- I'm sorry.
- Uh...

25:50.966 --> 25:54.345
I guess, um... I guess I'm, uh,

25:54.720 --> 25:56.518
a non-practicing Jew.

25:56.764 --> 25:59.062
Hey, I'm a non-practicing virgin.

26:02.770 --> 26:05.740
Who's this again?

26:06.148 --> 26:08.651
- Frampton. Peter Frampton?
- Frampton.

26:09.276 --> 26:11.529
I can't believe you don't
remember <i>Frampton Comes Alive.</i>

26:11.612 --> 26:14.365
That album, like, totally
changed my life.

26:15.324 --> 26:20.831
The most profound, important
invention of my lifetime.

26:21.163 --> 26:24.417
The Big Gulp. Because,
see, now listen.

26:24.750 --> 26:29.381
You get one in the morning. I'm
talking 44-ouncer, not this 32...

26:29.505 --> 26:32.304
- Wait a minute. Forty-four?
- Yeah, 44 ounces.

26:32.382 --> 26:35.226
How can you ingest 44
ounces of anything?

26:35.344 --> 26:37.245
How can you ingest 44
ounces of anything?

26:37.271 --> 26:42.842
You get one, you have your essential
vitamins and nutrients for the entire day.

26:42.851 --> 26:44.329
Oh, yeah, definitely.

26:44.355 --> 26:47.052
- Sure, you're totally covered.
- You do.

26:47.564 --> 26:51.319
Well, I guess it doesn't really
take much to make me happy.

26:51.693 --> 26:54.572
Hey, I'm not... I'm not
materialistic either.

26:54.947 --> 26:58.326
I mean, I think I'd be working
even if I wasn't getting paid.

26:58.408 --> 27:01.628
And I don't, like, want
to get a big house and...

27:01.703 --> 27:04.627
I just want, like, a nice house.

27:04.832 --> 27:07.711
I'm not into cars and stuff.

27:08.085 --> 27:09.883
I mean, I like my car.

27:10.045 --> 27:12.594
You're probably not...
Really not into, like,

27:12.673 --> 27:16.428
expensive, snazzy, Italian suits.

27:16.510 --> 27:18.387
- Oh, come on.
- I'm just kidding.

27:18.512 --> 27:21.891
- No, no, no. I'm not like that.
- I'm just kidding.

27:21.974 --> 27:25.854
I mean, I mean... I'm... I mean...

27:26.895 --> 27:29.289
I know why the caged bird
sings and everything.

27:29.315 --> 27:30.395
Oh, yeah? Why?

27:30.649 --> 27:34.904
Because he was in a
cage, and he was...

27:35.237 --> 27:37.331
I don't know. He had
high hopes or some...

27:37.406 --> 27:40.455
Okay, I dropped out of school
before we got to that, all right?

27:40.742 --> 27:43.791
I should have stayed in college
and gotten a degree in astronomy.

27:43.871 --> 27:46.090
- God, I love astronomy.
- Really?

27:46.165 --> 27:48.463
Yeah, I just... The math, though.
It was the math.

27:48.542 --> 27:52.172
Yeah, exactly. I loved astronomy,
too, and I got in the class,

27:52.254 --> 27:56.270
and it was like everything was
three squared times pi...

27:56.296 --> 27:58.206
- equals the root of...
- Pi!

27:58.260 --> 28:01.685
Pi. Yeah. And I just, like,
wanted to look at the stars.

28:02.181 --> 28:04.604
- Oh, same here. Exactly.
- It was so...

28:05.726 --> 28:07.245
I remember being so happy...

28:07.471 --> 28:10.632
on the roof of our old house,
just staring up at the stars.

28:10.731 --> 28:11.807
Mmm.

28:11.833 --> 28:14.636
I want to do that again.
I want to just...

28:14.943 --> 28:18.538
look up at the stars and
take the time to...

28:19.656 --> 28:22.910
smell the... Everything.

28:26.455 --> 28:29.334
'Cause it's like... Do you ever
have those moments in life

28:29.416 --> 28:31.760
where everything is okay?

28:32.753 --> 28:35.723
Do you know what I mean? Like, just
for one moment, everything is great?

28:35.797 --> 28:39.768
Not since I graduated.
No. But yeah, yeah.

28:40.093 --> 28:44.409
When you, like, catch yourself in
a moment, and you're saying...

28:44.435 --> 28:46.883
- "Wait, wait, I'm happy here."
- Right, right.

28:46.975 --> 28:50.174
- And then it just goes away really quickly.
- Gone.

28:51.271 --> 28:52.898
I know I've had a couple of those.

28:53.023 --> 28:55.187
I always forget them, but
I know I've had them.

28:55.213 --> 28:57.048
Oh, me, too.

29:01.156 --> 29:03.204
Like right now, this one.

29:06.578 --> 29:08.797
Yeah, like now. It's...

29:08.997 --> 29:11.125
<i>Who decides</i>

29:12.167 --> 29:16.217
<i>Clouds are stalking
islands in the sun</i>

29:18.215 --> 29:20.684
<i>Wish I could buy one</i>

29:22.511 --> 29:24.513
<i>Out of season</i>

29:25.806 --> 29:27.183
<i>But don't</i>

29:28.809 --> 29:30.356
<i>Hesitate</i>

29:31.979 --> 29:33.822
<i>'Cause your love</i>

29:35.774 --> 29:39.449
<i>Won't wait
Hey</i>

29:40.529 --> 29:43.282
<i>Ooh, baby I love your way</i>

29:43.365 --> 29:45.038
<i>Every day</i>

29:47.327 --> 29:51.707
<i>Wanna tell you
I love your way, ooh</i>

29:55.002 --> 29:58.006
<i>Ooh, baby, I love your way</i>

29:58.297 --> 30:01.471
<i>Every day I wanna be
with you night and day</i>

30:01.758 --> 30:04.352
- Shh!
- So you been up all night?

30:05.846 --> 30:10.397
I am picking up some very
strange vibes in here.

30:11.393 --> 30:15.068
They're of the
"I just got laid" variety.

30:15.814 --> 30:19.364
Did he dazzle you with his extensive
knowledge of mineral water?

30:19.526 --> 30:22.700
Or was it his in-depth
analysis of, uh,

30:22.779 --> 30:25.248
Marky Mark that finally
reeled you in?

30:26.116 --> 30:29.992
I would like to have been there
to watch how you rationalized

30:30.018 --> 30:33.236
sleeping with a yuppie-head
cheeseball on the first date.

30:33.415 --> 30:34.453
He's not a yuppie.

30:34.479 --> 30:37.336
He's the reason why
CliffsNotes were invented.

30:38.420 --> 30:42.873
Well, that pales in comparison to the
tweaked-out little skanks you date.

30:43.759 --> 30:46.888
- To hell with it. What do I care?
- What do you care?

30:46.970 --> 30:50.474
Why are you acting like a jealous
boyfriend all of a sudden?

30:50.557 --> 30:53.276
I am not acting like anything.

30:53.560 --> 30:55.312
I am calmly reading.

30:57.731 --> 31:00.154
God. If something's bothering you,

31:00.233 --> 31:02.782
I wish you could be man enough
to talk to me about it.

31:04.571 --> 31:06.289
All right, Lelaina.

31:19.503 --> 31:21.631
I am really in love with you.

31:26.843 --> 31:29.346
Is that what you
want to hear? Is it?

31:30.138 --> 31:32.891
Well, don't flatter yourself.

31:37.145 --> 31:38.488
Go to hell.

31:52.452 --> 31:54.204
Since I've been manager here,

31:54.287 --> 31:58.508
our gross has increased
over 20%, uh...

31:58.583 --> 32:00.460
- So?
- What?

32:01.461 --> 32:05.307
Okay, okay. Um,
I guess I'm proud of that.

32:05.382 --> 32:08.511
Ho, please. Look at this sweater.

32:08.844 --> 32:10.972
People don't know what it takes.

32:11.054 --> 32:14.809
I've never been a good
example before, and, um,

32:15.559 --> 32:18.904
I've never been good with
responsibility, so, uh...

32:18.979 --> 32:22.859
I blame my parents, though. I think
I was conceived on an acid trip.

32:24.025 --> 32:26.574
My parents got divorced
when I was, uh,

32:26.862 --> 32:28.409
five years old.

32:29.156 --> 32:32.626
And I saw my father about three
times a year after that.

32:34.244 --> 32:38.624
And when he found out that he had
cancer, he decided to bring me here,

32:38.707 --> 32:40.926
and he gives me this big,
pink sea shell,

32:41.001 --> 32:45.177
and he says to me, "Son, the
answers are all inside of this."

32:45.589 --> 32:49.560
And I'm all, like, "What?" But then
I realize that the shell's empty.

32:49.926 --> 32:53.100
There's no point to any
of this. It's all just a...

32:53.805 --> 32:58.026
A random lottery of meaningless
tragedy in a series of near-escapes.

33:00.645 --> 33:03.774
So I take pleasure in the
details. You know, uh,

33:04.774 --> 33:06.993
a Quarter Pounder with Cheese.

33:07.486 --> 33:08.954
Those are good.

33:09.654 --> 33:13.955
The sky about 10 minutes
before it starts to rain.

33:15.660 --> 33:18.755
The moment where your
laughter becomes a cackle.

33:20.290 --> 33:22.258
And I sit back, and I...

33:22.959 --> 33:25.087
I smoke my Camel straights.

33:27.881 --> 33:29.758
And I ride my own melt.

33:30.258 --> 33:32.306
Come on, come on. No laggin'.

33:32.385 --> 33:34.433
The free clinic AIDS test.

33:34.763 --> 33:37.186
The rite of passage
for our generation.

33:37.265 --> 33:38.938
We're so lucky. Come on.

33:39.601 --> 33:43.151
So, Vick, why are
you getting tested?

33:44.272 --> 33:46.650
One of my friends tested positive.

33:47.943 --> 33:50.913
Be on the safe side. You know.

33:55.951 --> 33:57.703
Vickie Miner.

34:02.332 --> 34:03.800
Vickie Miner?

34:08.380 --> 34:12.556
- You can forget it.
- Come on, Grant. That is incredible.

34:12.634 --> 34:14.887
It's junk. Depressing junk.

34:15.219 --> 34:17.813
You know my rules for Video
View, light and perky.

34:18.098 --> 34:22.353
Look, Lelaina, maybe I should
talk with Grant alone about this.

34:26.063 --> 34:28.737
Look, she's got real talent, and
I want to put her on staff.

34:28.817 --> 34:31.286
I will not have
Ms. Pierce on staff.

34:31.444 --> 34:34.322
I will walk out of here when
that happens. You watch.

34:34.489 --> 34:39.791
Okay, calm down. I mean, it's no big
deal. We don't have to have her.

34:39.953 --> 34:44.424
Having to look at that girl's pointy
face all day would make me ill.

34:44.583 --> 34:48.007
Just get rid of her like I
asked you in the first place.

34:51.590 --> 34:56.596
If I don't know where
to go, I'll get there.

34:57.345 --> 34:59.894
If I don't know where
to go, I'll get there.

34:59.973 --> 35:01.646
If I don't know...

35:07.314 --> 35:10.864
Ten seconds. Nine, eight, seven,

35:10.942 --> 35:14.367
- six, five, four...
<i>- ...saves you money!</i>

35:24.414 --> 35:26.382
Is this a good morning or what?

35:26.458 --> 35:28.631
Well,

35:28.877 --> 35:32.427
with us today is Libby
Cumba, author of this book.

35:34.674 --> 35:36.722
<i>Self-esteem for Parent and Child.</i>

35:37.177 --> 35:39.521
- Good morning, Libby.
- Good morning, Grant.

35:39.596 --> 35:42.190
Good morning. Now, Libby,

35:42.599 --> 35:44.727
I'm concerned with self-esteem.

35:45.143 --> 35:49.569
Personally, I've always had an odd
preference for very, very young girls.

35:54.903 --> 35:58.373
Uh, uh, being a total prick...

36:01.576 --> 36:04.546
<i>...ly pear, I, uh...</i>

36:05.955 --> 36:08.504
Why don't we welcome
this audience again, huh?

36:08.583 --> 36:10.085
Good morning!

36:12.337 --> 36:14.681
I make more of a
mess than Ruby does.

36:14.756 --> 36:17.680
You guys, we have to
have a family meeting.

36:17.801 --> 36:20.350
- Something's happened.
- Oh, no! They've discovered NutraSweet

36:20.428 --> 36:22.229
- causes you to grow a third eye.
- Oh, Jesus!

36:22.347 --> 36:25.601
- Everything's gonna be fine.
- Just wear a patch.

36:25.725 --> 36:27.027
Working out a plan.

36:27.053 --> 36:29.926
Yeah. There's a surgeon in
Paris who'll just remove it...

36:30.063 --> 36:32.737
- Just don't panic.
- It's not contagious.

36:32.857 --> 36:36.157
Would you shut up?
I just got fired.

36:36.277 --> 36:39.451
- Yeah.
- Oh, my god. What happened?

36:39.614 --> 36:41.491
You got fired?

36:42.075 --> 36:45.545
That just screws up my whole
idea of good and evil and...

36:45.620 --> 36:48.419
It's not like I had a hysterectomy.
You know, I got fired.

36:48.498 --> 36:50.717
I'll find something else, you know?

36:51.209 --> 36:54.554
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa! You're hired!

36:55.505 --> 36:57.428
I need a part-timer.
You need a job.

36:57.507 --> 37:00.511
That will be so cool!
It's only like $5 an hour,

37:00.593 --> 37:02.061
but it's a pretty good opportunity.

37:02.137 --> 37:04.435
- Yeah, it's a dream come true.
- It is!

37:04.514 --> 37:08.767
- You know, Vick, I'm working out a plan.
- Yeah? So what's the plan?

37:08.793 --> 37:12.772
I'm not gonna work at The
Gap, for Christ's sake. Okay?

37:14.482 --> 37:18.828
- No. I mean...
- Oh, no. I'm so sorry.

37:18.903 --> 37:22.498
Oh, how stupid of me to try
to drag you down to my level.

37:22.574 --> 37:25.828
- Vickie, you... Don't do this, okay?
- Shut up.

37:26.161 --> 37:29.506
Come on. This is just...
You know I didn't mean it.

37:29.831 --> 37:31.003
Vickie!

37:36.212 --> 37:38.715
<i>Burn, baby, burn</i>

37:39.632 --> 37:42.260
<i>Burn, baby, burn</i>

37:43.678 --> 37:46.898
<i>Burn, baby, burn
Disco inferno</i>

37:46.973 --> 37:52.696
<i>Burn, baby, burn burn that mother
down, y'all, burn, baby, burn</i>

37:54.355 --> 37:57.780
You see, this is where Troy
was fired from his 11th job.

37:58.109 --> 37:59.736
He was an illustrious
office cleaner.

37:59.861 --> 38:02.705
Now if you'll come
this way, please,

38:02.781 --> 38:07.378
we will continue our short but happy
walking tour of the career of Troy Dyer.

38:08.203 --> 38:10.877
And here we have the newsstand,

38:11.164 --> 38:13.713
where Troy dared to
ask the question,

38:14.000 --> 38:16.219
"Are employee snacks subsidized?"

38:17.337 --> 38:19.214
The answer, tragically, "No."

38:19.714 --> 38:22.308
In total, he has been fired

38:22.383 --> 38:25.182
- from, yes, count them, 12 jobs.
- Twelve?

38:26.095 --> 38:28.189
- Ouch.
- So you shouldn't feel so bad.

38:28.556 --> 38:31.025
One of these mornings I'm
gonna wake up before noon...

38:31.267 --> 38:35.238
- Yeah, right.
- ...I'm gonna turn on the TV,

38:36.689 --> 38:38.282
and there Bryant Gumbel
will be, and he'll say,

38:38.358 --> 38:40.235
"Today we have with us"

38:40.652 --> 38:44.156
"the Pulitzer Prize-winning
documentarian Lelaina Pierce."

38:44.239 --> 38:48.335
"Lelaina, after your first
film, <i>Why Barbie is Bad,</i>"

38:48.451 --> 38:51.250
"you seemed to have forgotten"

38:51.329 --> 38:53.752
"all about your best
friend, Troy Dyer."

38:54.415 --> 38:57.043
Troy who? What was that name again?

38:57.252 --> 38:59.755
Oh! Right through the heart.

39:00.421 --> 39:02.765
I'll probably be working
at the Whole Foods,

39:02.841 --> 39:05.344
you know, playing warehouses, hanging
around places like the Radio Shack,

39:05.426 --> 39:08.555
screaming that I used to know
you, and you'll be there

39:08.721 --> 39:10.940
in the lights, and you'll
be all beautiful and shit.

39:11.099 --> 39:14.273
Oh, Troy, no, no.
That'll never happen.

39:14.727 --> 39:18.197
They would never hire
you at Whole Foods.

39:19.440 --> 39:22.068
You see, Laney,
this is all we need,

39:23.027 --> 39:25.530
a couple of smokes, a cup of coffee

39:27.240 --> 39:29.709
and a little bit of conversation.

39:30.076 --> 39:33.296
- You and me and five bucks.
- You got it.

39:34.664 --> 39:36.758
- You know what?
- Hmm?

39:43.798 --> 39:45.892
- No, no. No.
- What?

39:46.175 --> 39:49.179
- Troy, I can't. I can't.
- Why not? You never thought about it?

39:49.512 --> 39:52.641
- Well, yes, of course I have, but I...
- But what?

39:52.724 --> 39:54.897
I can't not be friends
with you, okay?

39:54.976 --> 39:58.276
I don't want that. That's not what I'm
talkin' about. I'm talkin' about a...

39:58.396 --> 40:02.367
- You know, evolving.
- I just can't handle this right now.

40:02.483 --> 40:05.953
- I can't evolve right now.
- Why not?

40:06.487 --> 40:08.364
- Because of Michael?
- No!

40:10.700 --> 40:12.748
Yeah. Yes, yes.

40:25.340 --> 40:27.342
My parents got divorced
when I was 14.

40:27.425 --> 40:29.848
My dad, my dad,

40:30.011 --> 40:33.986
he remarried six months
after the divorce.

40:34.015 --> 40:36.155
That's quick. How did
everybody react?

40:36.181 --> 40:37.915
Um...

40:38.394 --> 40:40.943
My morn threatened to kill
herself in front of me.

40:41.022 --> 40:45.027
Patty got drunk in her closet every
morning before junior high school.

40:45.360 --> 40:48.079
- And you?
- Well, I, um...

40:49.322 --> 40:52.917
Somebody had to remember
to take out the trash,

40:53.326 --> 40:55.249
sign the report cards,
buy the milk,

40:55.328 --> 40:59.299
so, um, that kind of
ended up being me.

41:00.667 --> 41:03.341
I don't want to get married,
'cause I see how my parents are,

41:03.419 --> 41:06.673
and they've been together
like, um, 26 years,

41:07.173 --> 41:09.301
and they're like brother
and sister at this point.

41:09.384 --> 41:12.558
My mother goes to the
bathroom with the door open.

41:12.929 --> 41:16.183
That's "A". And "B,"
it's disgusting.

41:16.265 --> 41:18.984
I don't want any part of that.
I want first kisses.

41:19.060 --> 41:21.404
I want passion the
whole way through.

41:21.896 --> 41:25.776
It's better than havin' to kiss
your husband's ass all the time.

41:26.275 --> 41:27.401
Yeah.

41:28.236 --> 41:32.241
I think that your documentary would
be perfect for <i>In Your Face.</i>

41:33.533 --> 41:35.334
- Forget it. You're probably thinking...
- No!

41:35.410 --> 41:39.506
- ...more like, you know, PBS or something.
- No! No.

41:39.580 --> 41:43.255
I... You know what it is,
though? It's that I...

41:43.668 --> 41:48.265
Boy, okay. When I made this thing,
I kind of made this promise to myself

41:48.339 --> 41:50.558
that I wasn't gonna think
about where it was gonna

41:50.633 --> 41:52.681
end up, 'cause I didn't wanna

41:52.927 --> 41:55.305
unintentionally commercialize it.

41:55.680 --> 41:58.854
I think that's great. I think
you should definitely not

41:58.933 --> 42:01.937
unintentionally do anything that
you're not comfortable with.

42:02.061 --> 42:05.861
- I mean, not that I would intentionally...
- Well, plus, it's not done yet.

42:05.940 --> 42:08.534
Right. I know.
It was just a stupid...

42:08.609 --> 42:11.237
You know, I gotta go to
New York on Wednesday

42:11.320 --> 42:14.199
for this huge network
meeting thing,

42:14.282 --> 42:16.956
which is totally...
God, you would hate it.

42:17.452 --> 42:21.377
I hate it. I just thought that they
would freak out over your tapes,

42:21.456 --> 42:23.754
'cause they never see
anything that's really smart

42:23.833 --> 42:26.757
and has real, you know, quality

42:26.836 --> 42:30.431
and is good, like
you and your work,

42:31.549 --> 42:33.677
and I know I'm being selfish.

42:34.635 --> 42:36.637
Michael? Um,

42:37.638 --> 42:41.359
that is literally, literally,

42:41.434 --> 42:44.813
the nicest thing that
anyone's ever said to me.

42:45.480 --> 42:49.235
The sweetest thing that
anyone's ever said to me.

42:56.866 --> 42:59.870
So what are you doing for
the rest of your morning?

42:59.952 --> 43:03.001
Well, um... What am I doing?
What am I doing?

43:04.040 --> 43:06.384
Oh, well, I have a job interview.

43:06.584 --> 43:09.929
- Lelaina, this thing is from 1988.
- I know.

43:10.171 --> 43:13.345
So you're, like, six years late.

43:21.265 --> 43:25.395
I thought the ad said that this was
a job for a production assistant.

43:25.853 --> 43:29.153
Yes, you will be assisting me

43:29.899 --> 43:33.369
in the production of
videotapes, all right?

43:33.653 --> 43:36.702
You're gonna make copies
for me. Many copies.

43:38.241 --> 43:42.917
Oh, is this like a...
Like a pirate operation?

43:44.372 --> 43:46.591
Do I look like a pirate to you?

43:48.918 --> 43:51.171
Radio is all instinct, Lelaina.

43:51.546 --> 43:53.765
Do you know where all
radio comes from?

43:54.006 --> 43:56.225
The gut. It's all in the gut.

43:57.009 --> 43:59.387
'Cause when you think on your
feet, gotta go from your gut,

43:59.470 --> 44:02.565
and my gut is telling me that, uh,

44:02.932 --> 44:04.177
this isn't gonna work out.

44:04.203 --> 44:06.837
Maybe your gut's just
saying you're hungry or...

44:06.894 --> 44:09.818
Oh, no, no, no. It's
telling me that, uh...

44:10.565 --> 44:13.193
you're overqualified for this job.

44:13.276 --> 44:15.699
I'm really not that smart.

44:18.156 --> 44:21.126
No offense, sweetie, but you don't
have any experience on a newspaper.

44:21.200 --> 44:22.326
You're TV.

44:22.410 --> 44:25.835
I'm trying to make my
transition to print journalism.

44:25.913 --> 44:26.939
Ah. Why?

44:26.965 --> 44:31.069
Well, newspapers are the last
watchdogs of our government.

44:31.127 --> 44:34.381
They enforce the checks and balances, and
a half hour of TV only adds up to one...

44:34.463 --> 44:38.184
Okay. All right. Define "irony."

44:39.594 --> 44:41.767
Irony, uh... Irony.

44:42.847 --> 44:47.193
It's a noun. It's, uh,
when something is ironic.

44:48.311 --> 44:52.282
Well, I can't, uh, really define
irony, but I know when I see it.

45:15.588 --> 45:17.181
Hey. Hey.

45:18.049 --> 45:22.020
Oh, my God. I've never been so glad
to see anyone in my entire life.

45:22.261 --> 45:25.811
This day has been the biggest nightmare.
These job interviews, Troy?

45:26.140 --> 45:29.189
The word "vivisection,"
a staggering understatement.

45:29.602 --> 45:31.730
I mean, can you define "irony"?

45:31.812 --> 45:35.407
It's when the actual meaning is the
complete opposite from the literal meaning.

45:37.860 --> 45:39.237
Oh, my God.

45:40.071 --> 45:44.827
- Where were you when I needed you today?
- Uh, I should go.

45:45.117 --> 45:50.624
Oh, come on. Isn't there some statute of
limitations for embarrassing incidents?

45:53.501 --> 45:55.674
Your bravado is embarrassing.

45:59.131 --> 46:01.008
Hey, Troy.

46:02.009 --> 46:04.057
Come on. You can stay with
me for one cigarette.

46:04.470 --> 46:06.814
I know you can stay with
me for one cigarette.

46:07.139 --> 46:09.858
You and me? Five bucks?
Good conversation?

46:10.851 --> 46:12.023
Right?

46:14.188 --> 46:15.360
Laney.

46:17.692 --> 46:20.411
Troy, you haven't been
home in four days.

46:20.778 --> 46:22.906
Where have you been sleepin'?

46:26.200 --> 46:27.577
I gotta go.

46:34.163 --> 46:37.995
Mom, I need to talk
to you about a loan.

46:43.801 --> 46:45.394
Is it for drugs?

46:47.138 --> 46:52.190
No. No, it's not for drugs.
I was... I lost my job.

46:54.020 --> 46:57.149
But you shouldn't have any trouble
findin' another job, sugar booger.

46:57.231 --> 47:01.828
No, see, I tried. I applied for every
single opening in my field, but there's...

47:01.902 --> 47:04.576
There's nothing right now.

47:05.698 --> 47:09.077
Mmm, well. I hate to say it,

47:09.160 --> 47:11.379
but times are hard.

47:11.829 --> 47:14.753
You're just gonna have
to swallow your pride.

47:15.583 --> 47:18.382
Why don't you get a job at
Burgerama? They'll hire you.

47:18.586 --> 47:20.384
My Lord, I saw on TV

47:20.463 --> 47:24.184
they had this little retarded
boy workin' the cash register.

47:24.759 --> 47:27.057
Because I'm not retarded, Mom.

47:28.262 --> 47:30.640
I was Valedictorian
of my university.

47:31.766 --> 47:35.111
Well, you don't have to put
that down on your application.

47:42.610 --> 47:47.332
Ms. Pierce, do you have any idea what it
means to be a cashier at Wienerschnitzel?

47:47.782 --> 47:51.582
Yeah, it's taking orders
and making change and, uh,

47:51.911 --> 47:54.630
- taking...
- No. It's a juggling act.

47:55.498 --> 47:58.547
A juggling act. You mean,
like, metaphorically?

47:59.210 --> 48:02.259
No. I mean you got people
comin' at you from the front,

48:02.421 --> 48:06.767
comin' at you from the back, from the
sides, people at the condiment exchange,

48:06.926 --> 48:09.770
people at the drive-thru,
kids on bikes,

48:09.929 --> 48:12.899
- and they're all depending on who?
- Me?

48:13.057 --> 48:16.607
Yeah. You got time to lean,
you got time to clean, buddy.

48:17.144 --> 48:20.865
You gotta be 150% on your
toes, 150% of the time.

48:21.190 --> 48:25.787
There you go, sir, and have a
'tude, Wienerdude. All righty.

48:26.404 --> 48:28.953
Okay, I'm gonna throw a
few numbers out at you.

48:29.031 --> 48:31.580
You put 'em together in your
head as quick as you can.

48:31.951 --> 48:34.750
- Okay.
- 85 and 45. Go.

48:35.538 --> 48:37.415
- 140.
- Nope.

48:37.581 --> 48:39.709
- 150.
- Nope.

48:39.875 --> 48:42.219
- 160.
- It's not an auction.

48:43.129 --> 48:46.554
Ms. Pierce, there's a reason
I've been here six months.

49:04.567 --> 49:07.946
<i>...for the entire summertime
occurring in one day.</i>

49:08.112 --> 49:10.456
<i>Then last night we had
snow reports in Utah.</i>

49:10.614 --> 49:12.833
<i>Today reports of I-70
shut due to the snowfall.</i>

49:12.992 --> 49:14.710
<i>Now that very strong jet stream...</i>

49:15.661 --> 49:18.460
<i>- Royalton Hotel.</i>
- Is this the Royalton Hotel?

49:18.539 --> 49:21.008
<i>- That's what I said.</i>
- Sorry. I didn't hear you.

49:21.792 --> 49:24.295
I'm looking for a guest there.
His name's Michael Grates?

49:24.378 --> 49:25.721
<i>Hold one moment, please.</i>

49:29.049 --> 49:31.893
<i>That guest is out. Would you
like to leave a message?</i>

49:31.969 --> 49:35.394
Oh, no, that's okay. I'll
just try again later. Thanks.

49:41.353 --> 49:45.403
Hi, I'm Cheryl Goode, and welcome to
<i>Wedgie, The World of Hip Couture.</i>

49:45.774 --> 49:47.947
This week we're in South
Central Los Angeles

49:48.027 --> 49:52.248
at the intersection of Florence and
Normandie, the flash point of fashion.

49:52.406 --> 49:55.034
The faddest gangsta trend
will increase your piece.

49:55.201 --> 50:00.583
This bandana by Donna Karan is blue for
Crips, red for Bloods and only costs $75.

50:00.748 --> 50:03.001
<i>Ooh, hit me hoppin'
in a lifelike limbo</i>

50:03.167 --> 50:05.340
<i>Lookin' out of a smudged-up window</i>

50:05.461 --> 50:07.509
<i>We're not sure where
our lives are goin'</i>

50:07.588 --> 50:09.590
<i>Crazy sucker outside
begins a slow leak</i>

50:09.673 --> 50:11.675
<i>Don't know where our
next dollar's comin' from</i>

50:11.842 --> 50:13.765
<i>Livin' the life of a poor musician</i>

50:14.094 --> 50:17.815
<i>Hairline's gone so he keeps his
nine-to-five grubby, grubby...</i>

50:30.694 --> 50:32.913
Laney, have you seen a
pack of guitar strings?

50:32.988 --> 50:36.037
- I have to bring them to the club.
- I hope he knows

50:36.116 --> 50:39.165
that he still has to pay
some rent around here.

50:41.539 --> 50:45.294
I don't know where he thinks
he's spending his nights, but...

50:45.960 --> 50:47.428
Do you know?

50:49.838 --> 50:53.092
I'm late for a jean-folding
seminar. Let's locomote.

50:59.682 --> 51:03.858
<i>Now you can call your own personal
psychic anytime, 24 hours a day.</i>

51:04.019 --> 51:06.989
<i>Thanks to the nationwide
Psychic Discovery network,</i>

51:07.231 --> 51:10.826
<i>you can pick up the phone and talk
directly with a professional psychic</i>

51:10.901 --> 51:12.574
<i>in the privacy of your own home.</i>

51:12.653 --> 51:17.033
<i>I was unhappy in my career, and I needed
a change, but I didn't know what to do.</i>

51:17.658 --> 51:20.036
<i>- I called the Psychic Discovery Network...</i>
- Nothing is going down

51:20.119 --> 51:22.668
- according to plan.
- <i>Mm-hmm.</i>

51:22.746 --> 51:24.669
I mean, my best friend?

51:25.165 --> 51:27.839
I feel like I've lost him forever,

51:28.460 --> 51:31.339
and he was, like, my
touchstone, you know?

51:32.047 --> 51:35.267
<i>This man, does his name
start with the letter "N"?</i>

51:35.342 --> 51:39.267
<i>Because I'm getting a very
strong "N" vibration.</i>

51:40.306 --> 51:44.027
Newsstand! "N," newsstand. He
used to work at a newsstand.

51:44.101 --> 51:47.776
<i>- Uh-huh.</i>
- Oh, God, this is unbelievable.

51:47.855 --> 51:50.358
<i>Honey, that's not all I'm getting.</i>

51:50.691 --> 51:53.365
I mean, there are people
I know from high school,

51:53.444 --> 51:56.448
who are already married
and having babies.

51:57.156 --> 52:00.160
I mean, babies, okay?

52:00.409 --> 52:02.707
I can't even take
care of a Chia Pet.

52:02.870 --> 52:06.090
<i>Honey, I didn't have kids until
I was on my third husband.</i>

52:06.248 --> 52:08.797
- Oh, really?
<i>- All Geminis.</i>

52:11.003 --> 52:13.347
You know what I think, Denell?

52:14.632 --> 52:17.010
I think you still
really love Monte.

52:17.092 --> 52:20.221
<i>Yeah, you're probably right,
but it don't matter now.</i>

52:20.304 --> 52:22.272
Oh, yes, it does, Denell.

52:22.431 --> 52:24.274
I know you're afraid,

52:25.309 --> 52:29.314
but you gotta find him, and you've
gotta tell him how you really feel.

52:29.396 --> 52:31.945
<i>Find him? I've got five...</i>

52:32.149 --> 52:36.074
Lelaina, we need to talk to you.

52:39.406 --> 52:41.750
Hold on, Denell. Mmm. Hold on.

52:41.909 --> 52:43.752
- I'm on the phone.
- Yeah.

52:44.078 --> 52:47.878
I can see that. And we
have a $406 phone bill,

52:48.457 --> 52:51.506
mainly due to some calls
to a 1-900 number.

52:51.585 --> 52:54.429
<i>Lelaina, I'm sensing
you're in some trouble.</i>

52:54.505 --> 52:56.303
We'd help you out,
but we're broke, too,

52:56.423 --> 52:59.768
and we can't afford a new deposit
if the phone gets shut off.

53:03.263 --> 53:05.982
Maybe you could, uh, borrow
the money from Michael.

53:06.266 --> 53:08.985
Ohh, no, Sammy. Jesus.

53:09.186 --> 53:13.282
Laney, what are you doing?
You lay on that couch all day.

53:13.399 --> 53:17.324
Those pajamas are like a uniform.
You run up a $400 phone bill.

53:17.611 --> 53:21.115
You watch TV. You chain smoke.
You don't go outside.

53:21.448 --> 53:23.701
Man, you are in the bell jar.

53:24.451 --> 53:29.578
Look, this is my apartment.
I signed the lease.

53:29.604 --> 53:33.359
I let you move in here when
you had no job, no money,

53:33.393 --> 53:36.614
- and you sponged off me for two months.
- Yeah. Sponged?

53:36.630 --> 53:39.349
And now Miss Big Power Monger
goes, "I'm manager of The Gap."

53:39.466 --> 53:42.250
You think you can just come
in here and push me around?

53:42.276 --> 53:43.667
She's not bein' pushy.

53:43.804 --> 53:46.978
Sammy, what are you even
doing here? You don't live here.

53:47.057 --> 53:52.484
Hey, my little unemployed waif, you're the
one who's lookin' for work now, okay?

53:53.313 --> 53:55.611
You're really enjoying
this, aren't you?

53:55.691 --> 53:59.946
You're high. Why don't you go take a
walk outside and get some fresh air?

54:01.029 --> 54:03.532
You've been waiting for
this since the day we met.

54:03.615 --> 54:06.038
Who told you that?
Your psychic partner?

54:10.330 --> 54:13.800
I'll tell you the problem with your
generation. You don't have any work ethic.

54:14.126 --> 54:16.220
Take your friend,
Troy, for example.

54:16.295 --> 54:21.051
I went out of my way to set up an interview
for him and he didn't even show up.

54:21.759 --> 54:27.139
That wasn't his fault. He asked me to
call and cancel. Everything was going on

54:27.165 --> 54:29.125
- ...and it slipped my mind.
- Yeah. Mm-hmm.

54:29.224 --> 54:31.554
I'm sorry. But I have
a work ethic, Dad.

54:31.580 --> 54:34.362
- A very stong work ethic. Ask anyone.
- Good. Good.

54:34.579 --> 54:38.468
All you got to do is show
some ingenuity, hmm?

54:38.984 --> 54:40.984
Darlin', I love you and I
hate to break your plate,

54:41.028 --> 54:42.871
but you gotta grow up sometime.

54:42.946 --> 54:46.576
Now, I want you to go out there
and show me some ingenuity.

54:57.586 --> 54:59.213
<i>Ow-w-w</i>

55:02.800 --> 55:05.519
<i>Let me talk with you, my baby</i>

55:05.636 --> 55:07.638
<i>It is fair to say that maybe</i>

55:07.721 --> 55:13.774
<i>It is time for you to say we
need to share a point of view</i>

55:13.936 --> 55:17.657
<i>Livin' in the never never
Droppin' out of it together</i>

55:17.815 --> 55:22.195
<i>I could spend some time
forever with a girl like you</i>

55:22.361 --> 55:25.410
<i>Let me hear you say yeah
Let's go</i>

55:25.572 --> 55:27.825
Ooo-Ooo-Ooo-Ooo

55:27.991 --> 55:33.248
<i>You want to turn it in
Turn it into heaven, yeah</i>

55:33.413 --> 55:37.919
<i>Let's go
Ooo-Ooo-Ooo-Ooo</i>

55:38.085 --> 55:42.090
<i>You want to turn it in
Turn it into heaven</i>

55:42.256 --> 55:45.931
<i>Right here on earth</i>

55:46.093 --> 55:48.812
<i>Lookin' for tomorrow</i>

55:50.973 --> 55:53.442
<i>Can you see us one day</i>

55:56.186 --> 55:58.735
<i>Beg or steal or borrow</i>

56:00.983 --> 56:03.281
<i>We could live forever</i>

56:06.446 --> 56:08.448
<i>Never to say never</i>

56:09.157 --> 56:13.788
<i>You will be for me
I will fight for you, yeah</i>

56:13.954 --> 56:17.754
<i>Let's go
Ooo-Ooo-Ooo-Ooo</i>

56:17.916 --> 56:22.892
<i>You want to turn it in
Turn it into heaven, yeah</i>

56:26.383 --> 56:29.978
Well, that solves our first problem.
Rent's due this week.

56:34.141 --> 56:38.647
Well, well. Look who finally
decided to grace us with his...

56:40.772 --> 56:41.819
Presence.

56:41.899 --> 56:45.199
- This is, uh... This is, uh, Jean.
- Janine.

56:46.570 --> 56:48.572
Uh, Janine, Janine. It was...

56:48.655 --> 56:50.453
It was a little loud in the club.

56:50.532 --> 56:51.909
Excuse me.

56:53.493 --> 56:56.997
- Can't stay here, Troy.
- I'm just gonna pick something up.

56:57.372 --> 57:01.843
Well, mission accomplished.
Now leave.

57:02.169 --> 57:03.421
I think maybe I'm gonna wait...

57:03.503 --> 57:06.677
Always the mistress of
etiquette, you know, Laney?

57:07.507 --> 57:10.727
Why are you suddenly acting
like a jealous girlfriend?

57:11.762 --> 57:14.857
We're just trying to pay bills here.
So, Troy, if you got any money...

57:14.932 --> 57:18.607
Money? Oh, but what's
money to an artist?

57:18.936 --> 57:20.904
To a philosopher? It's just, uh,

57:21.146 --> 57:24.776
green-colored paper that floats
in and out of his life like snow.

57:24.858 --> 57:27.907
It's nothing you actually have to,
I don't know, work for, is it, Troy?

57:28.070 --> 57:31.540
- Not if you have Daddy's little gas card.
- You shut up!

57:31.698 --> 57:36.704
You shut up! I busted my ass to find a job.
You don't even show up for interviews.

57:36.912 --> 57:39.882
What is it that you want from me?
You want me to get a job on the line,

57:39.998 --> 57:44.299
until I'm granted leave with my gold-plated
watch and my balls full of tumors,

57:44.378 --> 57:46.801
'cause I surrendered the one
thing that means shit to me?

57:46.880 --> 57:50.726
You can exhale, 'cause it's not
gonna happen in this lifetime.

57:51.885 --> 57:53.790
All right, fine. You don't
want to work? Fine.

57:53.816 --> 57:56.211
- You want to be in a band?
- Laney, goddamn it!

57:56.264 --> 58:00.815
Then be in a goddamn band! Rehearse
every day! Play three times a night!

58:00.978 --> 58:05.074
Don't just dick around the same
coffeehouse for five years.

58:05.232 --> 58:08.031
Don't dick around with her.
Or with me.

58:08.443 --> 58:12.038
Try at something for once in your life.
Do something about it. But you know what?

58:12.114 --> 58:14.833
You better do it now
and better do it fast,

58:14.908 --> 58:16.910
because the world doesn't
owe you any favors.

58:16.994 --> 58:20.714
And whether you know it or not, you're
on the inside track to Loserville, USA,

58:21.373 --> 58:22.920
just like him.

58:33.301 --> 58:36.180
Okay, it's just too
psychotic in here now.

58:36.304 --> 58:39.558
- Lelaina, let's go for a walk.
- Fine.

58:41.435 --> 58:43.688
Come on, man, let 'em go.

58:47.149 --> 58:49.902
With pleasure, my
friends, with pleasure.

58:50.652 --> 58:53.622
"With pleasure." I really feel
sorry for that poor girl.

58:53.739 --> 58:56.478
How about when he sneaks
his laundry in with ours?

58:56.908 --> 58:58.632
It's like I'm pullin' that
stuff out of the dryer

58:58.634 --> 59:01.588
and there's five pairs of his boxers
I've just washed unknowingly.

59:01.621 --> 59:05.046
I'll just throw it back in his face.
I'm gonna do his laundry. Yeah!

59:05.292 --> 59:09.889
He's weird, he's strange, he's sloppy,
he's a total nightmare for women.

59:09.963 --> 59:12.967
I can't believe I haven't
slept with him yet.

59:14.301 --> 59:16.395
Do you ever wish
you were a lesbian?

59:16.636 --> 59:19.310
Don't you think it would
be so much easier?

59:21.141 --> 59:25.442
Sometimes. But, aah,
I couldn't go through with it.

59:25.520 --> 59:27.864
I'd start laughing or something.

59:29.274 --> 59:32.653
It's such a shame. I am
so through with men.

59:33.278 --> 59:36.828
If one more guy walks out on me,
I don't even know what. I swear.

59:36.907 --> 59:40.957
What are you talking about? Walk out
on you? You walk out on them.

59:41.161 --> 59:44.335
I've seen you. You're out the
door before the condom comes off.

59:44.998 --> 59:47.751
Listen to me, I'm just
beating them to the punch.

59:48.168 --> 59:49.260
Okay.

59:52.089 --> 59:54.638
You don't even know.
I'm sitting here

59:55.342 --> 59:59.768
maybe... Probably dying of AIDS.

01:00:06.895 --> 01:00:08.897
And I am totally alone.

01:00:14.361 --> 01:00:15.578
Vickie.

01:00:19.574 --> 01:00:21.247
You're not alone.

01:00:22.452 --> 01:00:26.707
Hey. Look, I'm sorry
for everything I said.

01:00:27.124 --> 01:00:29.718
And I'm sorry for
being such a bitch,

01:00:30.418 --> 01:00:33.217
but I have to tell you
you're not alone.

01:00:33.505 --> 01:00:36.179
You're not. And you're
not dying of AIDS.

01:00:36.550 --> 01:00:41.477
You don't understand. Every day, all
day, it's all that I think about, okay?

01:00:41.763 --> 01:00:46.064
Every time I sneeze, it's like I'm
four sneezes away from the hospice.

01:00:46.143 --> 01:00:51.400
It's not even happening to me. It's
like I'm watching it on <i>Melrose Place.</i>

01:00:51.523 --> 01:00:55.278
And I'm the new character. The HIV-AIDS
character and I live in the building.

01:00:55.402 --> 01:00:58.747
I teach everybody it's okay to be
near me, it's okay to talk to me.

01:00:59.072 --> 01:01:00.665
And then I die.

01:01:01.032 --> 01:01:04.002
There's everybody at my funeral
wearing halter tops and chokers

01:01:04.077 --> 01:01:06.079
or some shit like that.

01:01:06.329 --> 01:01:09.048
Vickie, stop, okay? Just stop.

01:01:09.374 --> 01:01:13.299
You're freaking out. And you know what?
You're gonna have to deal with the results.

01:01:13.378 --> 01:01:16.973
We're gonna have to deal with them just
like we've dealt with everything else.

01:01:17.048 --> 01:01:19.176
- This isn't like everything else.
- I know that.

01:01:20.177 --> 01:01:22.771
All right? But it's gonna be okay.

01:01:23.263 --> 01:01:25.766
You know? I know
it's gonna be okay.

01:01:30.437 --> 01:01:32.940
<i>Melrose Place</i> is a
really good show.

01:01:41.781 --> 01:01:43.954
<i>Lelaina Pierce.</i>

01:01:45.452 --> 01:01:48.171
Is there a Lelaina Pierce here?

01:01:51.541 --> 01:01:54.795
Yeah.

01:01:59.716 --> 01:02:00.968
- Hello.
<i>- Lelaina?</i>

01:02:01.009 --> 01:02:03.979
- Hi!
<i>- I had to call you right away.</i>

01:02:04.095 --> 01:02:06.268
- Listen, don't kill me, okay?
<i>- What? What?</i>

01:02:06.640 --> 01:02:09.314
- I took the tape and I showed it.
- No!

01:02:10.018 --> 01:02:14.023
Wait, wait. Listen. They freaked out.
They want to buy them.

01:02:14.272 --> 01:02:15.819
- No.
<i>- Yes!</i>

01:02:16.816 --> 01:02:20.320
<i>- They liked it?</i>
- No, they like psychotically loved it.

01:02:20.403 --> 01:02:22.872
<i>They wanna pay you for it.</i>

01:02:22.948 --> 01:02:24.950
I know this isn't PBS,
but is this okay?

01:02:24.976 --> 01:02:28.152
Yes! I was this close to selling
fruit at intersections!

01:02:28.178 --> 01:02:29.638
<i>Well, don't, all right? Don't.</i>

01:02:29.663 --> 01:02:33.634
Just hang on. I'm gonna get you some money.
I'm gonna be down there in a few days.

01:02:33.792 --> 01:02:37.592
I'm thinkin' about you
every second. Hello?

01:02:37.754 --> 01:02:40.724
- Hello! Hello, hello!
- Hello? Can you hear me now?

01:02:41.508 --> 01:02:44.011
- Where are you?
- I'm in a phone booth.

01:02:44.427 --> 01:02:46.521
Why are you on a cellular phone?

01:02:47.097 --> 01:02:48.849
I don't know. I have no idea.

01:02:48.932 --> 01:02:52.277
Michael, Michael, Michael!
I really miss you!

01:02:52.435 --> 01:02:54.688
I really miss you, too.
I love you. I... Oh, whoa!

01:02:55.188 --> 01:02:57.782
I mean, I mean, you amaze me!

01:02:57.857 --> 01:03:01.282
No, you amaze me!

01:03:01.444 --> 01:03:04.744
- Hello, can you hear me?
- No, Michael, I'm losing you.

01:03:05.532 --> 01:03:07.785
I'm gonna call you back.
Wait. What?

01:03:12.455 --> 01:03:15.334
Pay phone outside always amazes me.

01:03:17.002 --> 01:03:18.049
Hey.

01:03:19.587 --> 01:03:21.260
Try me. I'm free.

01:03:22.549 --> 01:03:25.519
Good mag, good mag.

01:03:28.221 --> 01:03:29.848
- Negatory.
- Yeah!

01:03:32.058 --> 01:03:35.437
Do ya hear that? Negative!
Here, let me see that.

01:03:37.439 --> 01:03:41.410
- Hey, hey! All righty. Whoo!
- Thanks for coming.

01:03:41.568 --> 01:03:43.834
A celebration zoom.

01:03:43.860 --> 01:03:46.540
- Let's get some ice cream.
- Okay, enough.

01:03:46.573 --> 01:03:48.575
- Ma!
- I'm right here, son.

01:03:48.867 --> 01:03:50.244
- Ma.
- Yeah?

01:03:51.077 --> 01:03:54.456
I have to tell you some... thing.

01:03:55.540 --> 01:03:59.261
I am a homosexual.

01:04:01.129 --> 01:04:02.676
Oh, Christ.

01:04:04.007 --> 01:04:09.355
Is there a support group I can join to
come to terms with my own homophobia?

01:04:09.512 --> 01:04:14.063
Yes, there is. A group
which is named P-FLAG,

01:04:14.225 --> 01:04:18.355
Parents and Friends
of Lesbians and Gays.

01:04:19.814 --> 01:04:21.532
Oh. Oh.

01:04:22.150 --> 01:04:25.825
P'flag. I'm beginning to
like the sound of that.

01:04:28.823 --> 01:04:31.827
What you've just witnessed here
is a pre-enactment of events

01:04:31.910 --> 01:04:34.129
that are about to take place.

01:04:36.122 --> 01:04:37.339
Well...

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:40.673
I came out to her.

01:04:43.004 --> 01:04:46.474
She's still a little bit upset.

01:04:48.009 --> 01:04:49.477
But you know,

01:04:50.887 --> 01:04:54.983
you know, the real reason that
I've been celibate for so long

01:04:55.141 --> 01:04:58.736
isn't really because I'm that
terrified of the big "A".

01:04:58.895 --> 01:05:01.489
But because I can't
really start my life

01:05:01.564 --> 01:05:03.987
without being honest
about who I am.

01:05:04.109 --> 01:05:07.079
<i>And...</i>

01:05:07.153 --> 01:05:10.498
<i>I wanna be in there, too.
I wanna feel miserable</i>

01:05:10.657 --> 01:05:13.661
<i>and happy and all of that.</i>

01:05:13.827 --> 01:05:16.171
<i>I mean, I... I wanna...</i>

01:05:19.833 --> 01:05:22.177
I wanna be let back in the house.

01:05:32.637 --> 01:05:33.763
Hello?

01:05:34.973 --> 01:05:36.099
Oh, hi.

01:05:36.724 --> 01:05:39.603
Um, sorry. Just...

01:05:40.019 --> 01:05:42.863
Door was... So I just, uh...

01:05:44.524 --> 01:05:46.652
Yeah. She's getting dressed.

01:05:59.831 --> 01:06:01.208
I'll just...

01:06:10.049 --> 01:06:12.133
I don't know if she
told you, but...

01:06:12.159 --> 01:06:15.046
I just came back from New York
with the tapes that she made.

01:06:15.096 --> 01:06:18.600
And the stuff with you,
that's really great stuff.

01:06:19.058 --> 01:06:23.484
That whole thing about, uh,
nobody can eat all the eggs?

01:06:23.646 --> 01:06:26.399
That was... That was really...

01:06:26.983 --> 01:06:29.156
I was quoting <i>Cool Hand Luke.</i>

01:06:30.778 --> 01:06:36.251
Yeah, that's okay. I mean, that's...
I know. I mean, still, it's...

01:06:37.619 --> 01:06:38.666
Hi.

01:06:40.580 --> 01:06:41.752
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:06:42.665 --> 01:06:44.714
What happened to
your normal clothes?

01:06:44.835 --> 01:06:48.559
Wow. Lelaina, look at you. You
look... Where'd you get that dress?

01:06:48.588 --> 01:06:52.258
Oh, um, I don't know.
I just bought it.

01:06:52.717 --> 01:06:54.264
But I think I'm gonna change...

01:06:54.385 --> 01:06:56.387
No, don't. You look beautiful.

01:06:56.513 --> 01:06:59.983
- You look like... You look like...
- A doily.

01:07:04.103 --> 01:07:06.356
- I'm gonna change.
- No, don't change.

01:07:06.439 --> 01:07:08.362
And don't go thinkin' for
yourself either, Laney.

01:07:09.484 --> 01:07:12.454
- What is your glitch, huh?
- My glitch?

01:07:13.780 --> 01:07:15.874
You know what? We're already late.

01:07:15.949 --> 01:07:18.498
- No, no. Hang on a second here.
- Ohh!

01:07:18.576 --> 01:07:20.305
Do you have a problem
with me or something?

01:07:20.331 --> 01:07:22.196
'Cause if you do,
let's get this out.

01:07:22.330 --> 01:07:24.503
Seriously. Is there like...
I mean, have I like, uh,

01:07:24.666 --> 01:07:27.715
stepped over some line in the
sands of coolness with you?

01:07:27.877 --> 01:07:31.632
Excuse me, if somebody doesn't
know the secret handshake.

01:07:31.798 --> 01:07:37.396
There's no secret handshake. There's an
IQ prerequisite, but no secret handshake.

01:07:39.305 --> 01:07:41.546
- I... This is... You, no...
- Come on. This is really...

01:07:41.641 --> 01:07:45.020
You've got this whole thing
with the world, don't you?

01:07:45.186 --> 01:07:47.530
- That's great, that's really wonderful.
- This is really stupid.

01:07:47.689 --> 01:07:50.192
But guess what? I'm a human being.
We're human beings, people.

01:07:50.275 --> 01:07:52.777
You know? We're not like,
uh, intelligence...

01:07:52.885 --> 01:07:56.039
- uh, quotations, or whatever.
- Just ignore him.

01:07:56.072 --> 01:07:57.324
- No!
- Done.

01:08:01.119 --> 01:08:03.417
Come on, let's go.
You don't need this.

01:08:03.496 --> 01:08:04.918
You don't know what she needs.

01:08:07.292 --> 01:08:09.841
I think I know what she needs
in a way that you never will.

01:08:15.341 --> 01:08:16.684
Let's go.

01:08:23.349 --> 01:08:25.693
<i>Baby, tell me that
my love ain't good</i>

01:08:25.810 --> 01:08:27.812
<i>I don't treat you right</i>

01:08:27.979 --> 01:08:32.906
<i>- I don't do you like I should</i>
- Listen, this guy back here, okay?

01:08:33.151 --> 01:08:35.448
- Hi. Hi.
- Hi.

01:08:36.321 --> 01:08:39.040
- So, ya ready?
- Um, what's it like?

01:08:39.323 --> 01:08:41.122
It's great. It's great.

01:08:41.283 --> 01:08:45.960
I haven't actually seen it yet, but
we had our best guys workin' on it.

01:08:46.288 --> 01:08:48.633
We just put some titles on,
shaped it a little bit.

01:08:48.707 --> 01:08:51.301
- It's gonna be great.
- Okay.

01:08:51.544 --> 01:08:53.716
- Okay?
- Okay. Bye.

01:08:56.131 --> 01:08:58.930
Okay, everybody.
It's a special night.

01:08:59.051 --> 01:09:02.426
'Cause, as you know, we're entering
a new phase here at the channel:

01:09:02.453 --> 01:09:04.314
real programming.

01:09:04.341 --> 01:09:08.045
And our first step is this
remarkable piece by Lelaina.

01:09:12.649 --> 01:09:15.948
So hang on, 'cause this is gonna
change the face of <i>In Your Face.</i>

01:09:45.180 --> 01:09:46.603
What's this?

01:09:46.765 --> 01:09:49.109
- Uh, it's transitional stuff.
- Ahh.

01:09:50.520 --> 01:09:54.320
<i>La la la
La la la</i>

01:09:55.274 --> 01:10:01.281
<i>The story of my life</i>

01:10:01.531 --> 01:10:04.205
- We're finished!
<i>- School's out</i>

01:10:04.617 --> 01:10:06.715
<i>Forever</i>

01:10:06.786 --> 01:10:09.881
I am not under any orders to
make the world a better place.

01:10:09.997 --> 01:10:12.591
And you wonder why we
never got involved.

01:10:12.792 --> 01:10:14.840
<i>To pieces</i>

01:10:15.461 --> 01:10:17.634
<i>Love can make you weep</i>

01:10:17.797 --> 01:10:20.141
I don't want to get married,
because I see how my parents are.

01:10:20.216 --> 01:10:22.457
- My parents got divorced...
- My parents got divorced...

01:10:22.635 --> 01:10:24.262
- ...when I was 14.
- ...when I was five years old.

01:10:24.387 --> 01:10:27.015
My mother actually goes to the
bathroom with the door open.

01:10:33.354 --> 01:10:37.124
- I swore I'd never get married.
- I want passion.

01:10:37.150 --> 01:10:39.403
<i>Let's talk about sex, baby</i>

01:10:40.153 --> 01:10:42.622
It turns ya on.

01:10:43.156 --> 01:10:46.366
Would you two just do it
and get it over with?

01:10:46.892 --> 01:10:48.633
Oh, my God.

01:10:48.828 --> 01:10:51.297
<i>But the question remains,</i>

01:10:52.415 --> 01:10:55.339
how can we repair all the
damage we inherited?

01:10:55.460 --> 01:10:57.678
I was told there'd be
no math on this exam.

01:10:57.704 --> 01:10:59.115
Can I change my answer?

01:10:59.172 --> 01:11:03.177
- The answer is simple.
<i>- We're on the road to nowhere</i>

01:11:03.259 --> 01:11:04.602
Jesus.

01:11:04.677 --> 01:11:06.850
The answer is...
The-The-The-The answer is...

01:11:06.929 --> 01:11:09.057
- Pizza!
- Pizza.

01:11:09.223 --> 01:11:10.440
Pizza.

01:11:10.767 --> 01:11:15.648
<i>We're on the ride to nowhere
Come take that ride</i>

01:11:17.732 --> 01:11:21.487
<i>Feeling okay this morning</i>

01:11:21.652 --> 01:11:25.873
- I... It's, uh...
- It's, yeah, right.

01:11:26.532 --> 01:11:32.335
<i>We're on the road to paradise
Here we go</i>

01:11:32.497 --> 01:11:34.215
- Lelaina.
<i>- Here we go</i>

01:11:42.799 --> 01:11:45.598
Lelaina, look, I'm sorry,
all right? I didn't know.

01:11:45.676 --> 01:11:47.387
That is not my work.
That's not what I did.

01:11:47.413 --> 01:11:49.581
- That's not what I want. Nothing!
- I know!

01:11:49.680 --> 01:11:53.560
- I can't believe I trusted you!
- I had no idea! I didn't see it!

01:11:54.060 --> 01:11:56.904
I guess it was a little slow
and they cut it up a little...

01:11:57.063 --> 01:12:00.693
They cut up everything
that meant anything to me!

01:12:00.983 --> 01:12:03.379
I don't even think you
realize what you've done.

01:12:03.405 --> 01:12:06.364
- You don't get it. You just don't get it.
- What? I do get it!

01:12:06.948 --> 01:12:10.669
You have this great piece of work, and
we have this audience, these kids.

01:12:10.743 --> 01:12:13.917
It's like trying to feed them meat
loaf and they don't want to eat it.

01:12:14.080 --> 01:12:15.125
- So you gotta give them...
- Meat loaf?

01:12:15.151 --> 01:12:17.779
"Here comes the plane! It's coming
up the hangar. Open up the hangar!"

01:12:17.816 --> 01:12:20.862
- But it's still meat loaf.
- It was never meat loaf!

01:12:20.920 --> 01:12:24.720
That's a bad... I'm sorry. They
were just trying to market it.

01:12:24.799 --> 01:12:27.743
I wish I could be perfect, okay?
I wish I could be like Troy,

01:12:27.760 --> 01:12:30.013
riding on his melted cheese
sandwich and everything...

01:12:30.039 --> 01:12:31.710
Don't you dare bring
Troy into this.

01:12:31.931 --> 01:12:36.277
I wish I could live off of creeds
and mottos and all that shit.

01:12:36.477 --> 01:12:40.232
But I'm in the real world
and I have ideals also.

01:12:41.023 --> 01:12:43.117
They're that I...

01:12:43.192 --> 01:12:47.117
I care about you and
I want to make you happy...

01:12:50.491 --> 01:12:52.084
I just... Look.

01:12:55.079 --> 01:12:58.379
I... I'll make them take
the pizza thing out, okay?

01:13:02.795 --> 01:13:05.514
<i>I'm just a bill</i>

01:13:05.590 --> 01:13:08.309
<i>Yes, I'm only a bill</i>

01:13:09.427 --> 01:13:13.978
<i>And I'm sittin' here
on Capitol Hill</i>

01:13:15.224 --> 01:13:19.525
<i>Well, it's a long,
long journey to...</i>

01:13:26.986 --> 01:13:29.330
How'd the big premiere turn out?

01:13:31.824 --> 01:13:32.950
Fine.

01:13:40.708 --> 01:13:43.006
They're just videotapes, right?

01:13:45.171 --> 01:13:46.514
Who cares?

01:13:50.134 --> 01:13:54.514
It's... I worked so hard
on them, you know?

01:13:57.183 --> 01:13:59.277
It's just, I worked so hard.

01:14:01.354 --> 01:14:04.608
- Ah, forget it. I just sound pathetic.
- No, you don't.

01:14:05.191 --> 01:14:07.489
You don't sound pathetic.

01:14:08.277 --> 01:14:12.282
I know it sounds stupid, but it
really meant something to me.

01:14:14.367 --> 01:14:20.500
I know it wasn't gonna end world
hunger or save the planet,

01:14:20.581 --> 01:14:23.676
but it just meant something to me.

01:14:27.380 --> 01:14:28.848
I just don't

01:14:31.634 --> 01:14:34.854
understand why things just
can't go back to normal

01:14:34.929 --> 01:14:39.605
at the end of the half hour, like
on <i>The Brady Bunch</i>, or something.

01:14:42.186 --> 01:14:44.689
Well, 'cause Mr. Brady
died of AIDS.

01:14:48.818 --> 01:14:51.162
Things don't work out like that.

01:14:53.614 --> 01:14:57.289
I was really gonna be
something by the age of 23.

01:14:59.870 --> 01:15:04.922
Honey, all you have to be by
the age of 23 is yourself.

01:15:09.547 --> 01:15:11.925
I don't know who that is anymore.

01:15:13.384 --> 01:15:14.761
Well, I do.

01:15:16.595 --> 01:15:19.724
And we all love her. I love her.

01:15:21.183 --> 01:15:22.309
Uh...

01:15:24.770 --> 01:15:27.694
She breaks my heart again
and again, but, uh,

01:15:29.984 --> 01:15:31.361
I love her.

01:16:32.421 --> 01:16:35.425
I've wanted you like this
for all these years.

01:16:37.176 --> 01:16:38.598
So have I.

01:17:18.634 --> 01:17:20.557
- Hey.
- Hi.

01:17:21.262 --> 01:17:24.607
- Where are you going?
- I have rehearsal.

01:17:26.809 --> 01:17:29.938
At 8:24 in the morning?

01:17:37.069 --> 01:17:38.867
- So that's it?
- No.

01:17:39.905 --> 01:17:42.408
No, that's not it.
I just... I, uh...

01:17:42.491 --> 01:17:43.993
I have to go.

01:18:00.634 --> 01:18:05.105
<i>Got a pothead mama
Got a cokehead dad</i>

01:18:08.767 --> 01:18:13.614
<i>I'm the ultramodern version
The American man</i>

01:18:17.151 --> 01:18:21.622
<i>I don't feel good
But I don't feel bad</i>

01:18:23.073 --> 01:18:26.043
<i>'Cause me, you see
I'm nothin'</i>

01:18:32.416 --> 01:18:36.262
<i>I ain't left, I ain't right
People say I'm wrong</i>

01:18:36.420 --> 01:18:39.890
<i>Before I was born
Oh, I was all gone</i>

01:18:40.466 --> 01:18:45.814
<i>Don't even make sense
that I wrote this song</i>

01:18:45.888 --> 01:18:47.606
Tell me it's not true.

01:18:47.973 --> 01:18:50.897
<i>'Cause me, you see
I'm nothin'</i>

01:18:53.145 --> 01:18:54.647
<i>I'm nothin'</i>

01:18:57.149 --> 01:18:59.072
<i>Nothin'</i>

01:19:00.236 --> 01:19:01.658
<i>That's me</i>

01:19:04.490 --> 01:19:05.912
<i>I'm nothin'</i>

01:19:12.665 --> 01:19:14.417
Laney,

01:19:14.500 --> 01:19:17.845
sex is the quickest way
to ruin a friendship.

01:19:23.425 --> 01:19:27.851
Thank you. We'll be right back with
a new American cheese snack idea.

01:19:29.014 --> 01:19:31.312
Hey, Troy. You got a phone call.

01:19:35.145 --> 01:19:37.022
Lelaina! Hi.

01:19:37.189 --> 01:19:41.319
Hi. Don't say anything.
I screwed up, I know.

01:19:41.485 --> 01:19:46.632
I should've protected you and your work
and I didn't. I'm so sorry that I didn't.

01:19:47.032 --> 01:19:48.625
I wanna make this up to you.

01:19:49.201 --> 01:19:52.330
You mean so much to me,
Lelaina, and I just...

01:19:52.913 --> 01:19:54.460
Look, two tickets,
all right? New York.

01:19:54.540 --> 01:19:57.919
We go and we give them a presentation
of the show the way you want it done.

01:19:58.043 --> 01:19:59.466
Michael, I don't...

01:19:59.492 --> 01:20:01.322
I know, I know. But
this time's different.

01:20:01.380 --> 01:20:05.760
Who's the boss? Huh? Tony Danza?
I don't think so. It's you.

01:20:05.843 --> 01:20:08.642
It's your show. And I just...

01:20:10.055 --> 01:20:14.686
I just feel like maybe
I deserve another shot here.

01:20:19.773 --> 01:20:21.901
- Well, hi, Lelaina.
- Hi.

01:20:23.068 --> 01:20:25.617
What, is there a frog in your throat,
or are you just glad to see me?

01:20:25.696 --> 01:20:29.166
Hi, Mike. Thanks for comin' down.
No hard feelings.

01:20:37.082 --> 01:20:39.676
Lelaina, you're looking
a little peaked.

01:20:40.252 --> 01:20:42.550
- Yeah. Are you okay?
- She's fine.

01:20:42.629 --> 01:20:44.848
She's just had too many
Diet Cokes today.

01:20:44.923 --> 01:20:47.346
Yeah, this girl is
cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs.

01:20:47.426 --> 01:20:48.518
Heh!

01:20:51.096 --> 01:20:53.474
So are you gonna tell him or am I?

01:21:04.401 --> 01:21:07.951
Could you excuse me?
Could I talk to you?

01:21:14.244 --> 01:21:15.291
Hi.

01:21:19.458 --> 01:21:23.304
You wanna tell me what the hell he's
doin' here? I wanted to talk to you.

01:21:24.588 --> 01:21:27.011
What the hell do you care? You
totally bailed on me this morning.

01:21:27.091 --> 01:21:31.141
I panicked. It happens. I thought we
could, uh, work it out, you know?

01:21:31.387 --> 01:21:34.311
I don't know if now's
the right time for us.

01:21:35.682 --> 01:21:39.983
I meant everything that I said to you
last night. Don't look at me like that.

01:21:40.396 --> 01:21:42.569
Don't look at me like that.
That's not what I'm saying.

01:21:43.816 --> 01:21:46.410
I'm not saying I... Look.

01:21:47.069 --> 01:21:49.872
You are the only woman that
I could ever commit myself to.

01:21:49.898 --> 01:21:52.059
So what? Do I get a medal?

01:21:52.085 --> 01:21:55.611
I win the big commitment
cook-off and you just run away?

01:21:55.661 --> 01:21:57.880
I knew this was gonna happen!

01:21:58.038 --> 01:22:00.461
I don't... I don't wanna lose you.

01:22:00.666 --> 01:22:03.886
I've never been in an
experience like this before.

01:22:05.546 --> 01:22:08.800
I've never had sex with
somebody that I loved before.

01:22:09.007 --> 01:22:13.262
God! Oh, well,
congratulations, Troy Dyer.

01:22:13.345 --> 01:22:17.395
Welcome to the world of the emotionally
mature. It's a nice place to visit.

01:22:17.808 --> 01:22:20.127
Hey, you may run into
Michael. He lives here.

01:22:20.153 --> 01:22:24.273
Yeah, right, Michael. He lets you
navigate that entire relationship.

01:22:24.356 --> 01:22:26.450
Sorry, Lelaina, but you
can't navigate me.

01:22:26.608 --> 01:22:31.830
I might do mean things, hurt you, run
away, and you might hate me forever.

01:22:31.905 --> 01:22:36.832
I know that scares the shit out of you,
because I'm the only real thing you have.

01:22:37.703 --> 01:22:40.832
Oh, yeah? Well,
that ain't real much.

01:22:42.458 --> 01:22:44.426
<i>One, two, three, four</i>

01:22:45.210 --> 01:22:47.008
Hey, Troy, man, you're on.

01:22:47.171 --> 01:22:49.014
<i>No bed of roses</i>

01:22:49.173 --> 01:22:51.847
<i>No bed of roses</i>

01:22:52.843 --> 01:22:56.222
<i>No bed of roses</i>

01:22:56.722 --> 01:22:58.044
Michael, I'm sorry.

01:22:58.070 --> 01:23:00.717
No, listen, I'm sorry.
That's what this is all about.

01:23:01.101 --> 01:23:02.819
This one's for you, Laney.

01:23:17.075 --> 01:23:19.328
<i>Why can't I get just one kiss</i>

01:23:19.411 --> 01:23:21.209
<i>Why can't I get just one kiss</i>

01:23:21.371 --> 01:23:23.248
<i>Believe, some things
that I wouldn't miss</i>

01:23:23.332 --> 01:23:25.835
<i>But I look at your pants
and I need a kiss</i>

01:23:26.168 --> 01:23:28.136
<i>Why can't I get just one screw</i>

01:23:28.212 --> 01:23:30.431
<i>Why can't I get just one screw</i>

01:23:30.506 --> 01:23:32.554
<i>Believe me I'd know what to do</i>

01:23:32.633 --> 01:23:34.681
<i>But somethin' won't let
me make love to you</i>

01:23:34.760 --> 01:23:36.933
<i>Why can't I get just one, huh</i>

01:23:37.012 --> 01:23:39.435
<i>Why can't I get just one, huh</i>

01:23:54.071 --> 01:23:55.869
Oh, nice job. Very well done.

01:23:55.948 --> 01:23:58.451
Yeah, I don't want
to hear it from you.

01:23:58.825 --> 01:24:01.704
Yeah, well, I forgot. I'm not
qualified to talk to you.

01:24:01.787 --> 01:24:04.040
I'm sorry I can't be Mister,
uh, "Hey, look at me",

01:24:04.122 --> 01:24:06.466
"I'm Buddha on the mountaintop."

01:24:06.708 --> 01:24:08.551
You know what you remind me of?

01:24:08.627 --> 01:24:12.427
You're like that guy with
the hat and the bells

01:24:12.548 --> 01:24:15.051
- and the little, you know...
- The court jester.

01:24:15.133 --> 01:24:16.100
Yeah, right.

01:24:16.176 --> 01:24:18.554
Where everything's so easy to
laugh at from a safe distance

01:24:18.637 --> 01:24:20.685
back in Clever-Cleverland.

01:24:21.098 --> 01:24:22.941
You know what happens to him?

01:24:23.100 --> 01:24:28.322
They find his skull in a grave and they
go, "Oh, I knew him and he was funny."

01:24:28.981 --> 01:24:32.451
And the guy, the court
jester, dies all by himself.

01:24:34.903 --> 01:24:37.827
Where'd you hear that?
A Renaissance Festival?

01:24:42.077 --> 01:24:44.671
Besides, everyone
dies all by himself.

01:24:53.005 --> 01:24:55.099
If you really believe that,

01:24:56.592 --> 01:24:58.720
who you lookin' for out here?

01:25:18.947 --> 01:25:22.747
<i>You say you want</i>

01:25:24.786 --> 01:25:27.960
<i>Diamonds and a ring of gold</i>

01:25:29.416 --> 01:25:33.262
<i>You say you want</i>

01:25:35.005 --> 01:25:38.555
<i>Your story to remain untold</i>

01:25:39.509 --> 01:25:43.764
<i>But all the promises we make</i>

01:25:44.640 --> 01:25:48.770
<i>From the cradle to the grave</i>

01:25:50.062 --> 01:25:56.240
<i>When all I want is you</i>

01:26:05.494 --> 01:26:10.091
<i>You say you'll give me</i>

01:26:11.083 --> 01:26:14.929
<i>A highway with no one on it</i>

01:26:16.254 --> 01:26:20.100
<i>Treasure just to look upon it</i>

01:26:20.926 --> 01:26:24.772
<i>All the riches in the night</i>

01:26:26.181 --> 01:26:30.607
<i>You say you'll give me</i>

01:26:31.978 --> 01:26:36.074
<i>Eyes on a moon of blindness</i>

01:26:36.775 --> 01:26:41.121
<i>A river in a time of dryness</i>

01:26:42.114 --> 01:26:45.789
<i>A harbor in the tempest</i>

01:26:46.535 --> 01:26:51.257
<i>But all the promises we make</i>

01:26:51.707 --> 01:26:55.712
<i>From the cradle to the grave</i>

01:26:56.795 --> 01:27:03.223
<i>When all I want is you</i>

01:27:31.163 --> 01:27:32.380
Hello?

01:27:33.999 --> 01:27:37.173
- Hello?
<i>- You-ou</i>

01:27:37.335 --> 01:27:42.182
<i>All I want is you-ou</i>

01:27:42.340 --> 01:27:47.312
<i>All I want is you-ou</i>

01:27:47.554 --> 01:27:52.651
<i>All I want is you-ou</i>

01:28:16.291 --> 01:28:18.614
- Hey, Laney. This is Lance.
- Hi.

01:28:18.676 --> 01:28:23.282
Hi. Um, I just need
to know if he's okay.

01:28:26.343 --> 01:28:31.190
Okay. All I know is he went
back to Chicago alone.

01:28:34.726 --> 01:28:37.275
I'm not supposed to
know that, am I?

01:29:02.462 --> 01:29:03.588
Shit.

01:29:33.618 --> 01:29:34.665
Hi.

01:29:36.204 --> 01:29:40.004
I was wondering if I could talk
to you a minute before you go.

01:29:44.754 --> 01:29:48.804
See, the thing is that, uh...

01:29:52.679 --> 01:29:56.309
Well... Uh, my dad died.

01:29:56.516 --> 01:30:00.817
- Oh, God, Troy, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
- No, it's... No, it...

01:30:02.314 --> 01:30:04.487
What happened was that, um,

01:30:05.984 --> 01:30:10.205
I kind of got this arcane
glimpse at the universe.

01:30:11.656 --> 01:30:15.752
And the best thing I can
say about that is, uh...

01:30:20.874 --> 01:30:23.593
I don't know.

01:30:28.965 --> 01:30:33.061
I have this planet of regret

01:30:33.845 --> 01:30:35.847
sitting on my shoulders.

01:30:37.432 --> 01:30:40.811
You have no idea how much
I wish that I could go back

01:30:41.394 --> 01:30:44.898
to that morning after we made love

01:30:45.857 --> 01:30:47.985
and do everything different.

01:30:49.569 --> 01:30:51.822
But I know that I can't, so...

01:30:54.115 --> 01:30:57.619
I thought that I would come
here and tell you somethin'.

01:30:59.204 --> 01:31:03.713
And what I wanted to tell you...
was that I love you.

01:31:04.084 --> 01:31:07.634
And, uh, I just wanted to make
sure that that was clear,

01:31:07.712 --> 01:31:10.215
so that there wasn't any confusion.

01:31:16.554 --> 01:31:17.555
Um,

01:31:19.265 --> 01:31:20.858
so, anyway, uh,

01:31:23.603 --> 01:31:25.401
where are you going?

01:31:25.730 --> 01:31:27.698
I was gonna look for you.

01:31:30.151 --> 01:31:31.403
What for?

01:31:35.156 --> 01:31:39.411
Just wanted to see
if you were okay.

01:31:46.751 --> 01:31:48.753
Well, I had a shitty week.

01:32:28.460 --> 01:32:31.464
<i>Well, Frog went a-courtin'
and he did ride</i>

01:32:31.588 --> 01:32:35.434
<i>With a sword and a
pistol by his side</i>

01:32:35.633 --> 01:32:39.638
<i>Uh-huh</i>

01:32:42.057 --> 01:32:45.061
<i>Well, he rode right up
to Miss Mousey's door</i>

01:32:45.143 --> 01:32:47.487
<i>Uh-huh</i>

01:32:48.146 --> 01:32:50.569
<i>At the beep, please leave
your name, number,</i>

01:32:50.648 --> 01:32:53.500
<i>and a brief justification for
the ontological necessity</i>

01:32:53.526 --> 01:32:56.363
<i>of modern man's existential
dilemma. We'll get back to you.</i>

01:32:56.446 --> 01:32:59.416
<i>Lelaina, this is your dad.</i>

01:32:59.491 --> 01:33:02.916
<i>Give me a call when you get this.
I need you to explain something.</i>

01:33:02.994 --> 01:33:05.292
<i>I just got a $900
bill on my gas card.</i>

01:33:08.666 --> 01:33:14.139
<i>If we should fall, love will
catch us every time</i>

01:33:14.756 --> 01:33:18.101
<i>I hear you call
I will run</i>

01:33:20.178 --> 01:33:25.480
<i>And if the magic of the
adventure overcomes</i>

01:33:25.642 --> 01:33:29.522
<i>We won't cry,
because it could be fun</i>

01:33:29.687 --> 01:33:32.065
What I'm tryin' to do is
constantly find those people,

01:33:32.190 --> 01:33:34.488
find out what makes them
the best, and bring that...

01:33:34.859 --> 01:33:37.578
I've been getting a razzing for
being bald and I'm a young man.

01:33:37.695 --> 01:33:40.448
No more dates without being
called old man, but...

01:33:44.828 --> 01:33:47.047
Roy, why are you doing this to me?

01:33:47.247 --> 01:33:48.999
I know we can be happy together.

01:33:49.541 --> 01:33:50.963
You'll chill in time.

01:33:51.042 --> 01:33:54.546
Right now I need someone who understands
what my music and the band mean to me.

01:33:54.629 --> 01:33:56.927
But it's just music, Roy.

01:33:57.048 --> 01:34:00.348
I'm a human being
with deep feelings

01:34:01.052 --> 01:34:05.023
- who feels things deeply.
- Music is feeling, babe.

01:34:05.431 --> 01:34:09.440
The band may be a small dream, but it's
the only one I've got. I'm Audi 5000.

01:34:09.644 --> 01:34:12.422
<i>Till I'm going, going, gone</i>

01:34:12.448 --> 01:34:14.566
Please, don't let him
get drunk and drive.

01:34:14.567 --> 01:34:17.285
<i>Won't be very long</i>

01:34:17.443 --> 01:34:21.013
<i>Till I'm going, going, gone</i>

01:34:34.127 --> 01:34:35.549
<i>You say</i>

01:34:37.422 --> 01:34:40.096
<i>I only hear what I want to</i>

01:34:45.972 --> 01:34:47.770
<i>You say</i>

01:34:49.309 --> 01:34:51.812
<i>I talk so all the time</i>

01:34:52.395 --> 01:34:53.817
<i>So</i>

01:34:57.609 --> 01:35:00.408
<i>And I thought what
I felt was simple</i>

01:35:00.653 --> 01:35:03.281
<i>And I thought that I don't belong</i>

01:35:03.740 --> 01:35:06.459
<i>And now that I am leaving</i>

01:35:06.618 --> 01:35:08.746
<i>Now I know that
I did something wrong</i>

01:35:08.912 --> 01:35:11.131
<i>'Cause I missed you</i>

01:35:12.707 --> 01:35:14.801
<i>Yeah, yeah</i>

01:35:15.126 --> 01:35:16.799
<i>I missed you</i>

01:35:22.008 --> 01:35:23.476
<i>And you say</i>

01:35:25.303 --> 01:35:28.432
<i>I only hear what I want to
I don't listen hard</i>

01:35:28.765 --> 01:35:31.359
<i>Don't pay attention to the
distance that you're running</i>

01:35:31.517 --> 01:35:35.988
<i>To anyone, anywhere
I don't understand if you really care</i>

01:35:36.147 --> 01:35:40.323
<i>I'm only hearin' negative
No, no, no, no</i>

01:35:41.653 --> 01:35:45.328
<i>So I turn the radio on
I turn the radio up</i>

01:35:45.657 --> 01:35:48.080
<i>And this woman was singin' my song</i>

01:35:48.159 --> 01:35:51.003
<i>Lovers in love and
the others run away</i>

01:35:51.162 --> 01:35:54.166
<i>Lover is crying 'cause
the other won't stay</i>

01:35:54.249 --> 01:35:56.502
<i>Some of us hover while
we weep for the other</i>

01:35:56.584 --> 01:35:58.757
<i>Who was dyin' since the
day they were born</i>

01:35:59.003 --> 01:36:02.598
<i>Well, well, this is not that
I think that I'm throwin'</i>

01:36:02.674 --> 01:36:04.676
<i>But I'm thrown</i>

01:36:05.843 --> 01:36:08.471
<i>And I thought I'd live forever
But now I'm not so sure</i>

01:36:08.554 --> 01:36:10.397
<i>You try to tell me that I'm clever</i>

01:36:10.515 --> 01:36:15.487
<i>That won't take me anyhow
or anywhere with you</i>

01:36:18.356 --> 01:36:23.453
<i>You said that I was naive and
I thought that I was strong</i>

01:36:23.528 --> 01:36:26.452
<i>Oh, I thought
Hey, I can leave, I can leave</i>

01:36:26.531 --> 01:36:29.535
<i>Oh, but now I know that I was wrong</i>

01:36:29.701 --> 01:36:31.999
<i>'Cause I missed you</i>

01:36:33.204 --> 01:36:37.710
<i>Yeah-ah, I miss you</i>

01:36:41.296 --> 01:36:44.345
<i>He said you caught me 'cause you
want me and one day you'll let me go</i>

01:36:44.424 --> 01:36:47.303
<i>You try to give away a keeper
or keep me 'cause you know</i>

01:36:47.385 --> 01:36:51.231
<i>You're just so scared to lose</i>

01:36:52.890 --> 01:36:54.608
<i>And you say</i>

01:36:57.895 --> 01:36:59.693
<i>Stay</i>

01:37:06.362 --> 01:37:08.285
<i>And you say</i>

01:37:09.615 --> 01:37:12.539
<i>I only hear what I want to</i>

01:37:38.186 --> 01:37:41.110
<i>Ooh, my little pretty one
My pretty one</i>

01:37:41.272 --> 01:37:44.401
<i>When you gonna give
me some time, Sharona</i>

01:37:44.609 --> 01:37:47.579
<i>Ooh, you make my motor run
My motor run</i>

01:37:47.820 --> 01:37:50.994
<i>Gun it comin' off of
the line, Sharona</i>

01:37:51.115 --> 01:37:54.369
<i>Never gonna stop, give it up
Such a dirty mind</i>

01:37:54.452 --> 01:37:57.626
<i>I always get it up for the
touch of the younger kind</i>

01:37:57.747 --> 01:38:01.251
<i>My, my, my-y-y
Whoo</i>

01:38:02.168 --> 01:38:04.387
<i>M-M-M-My Sharona</i>

01:38:07.632 --> 01:38:10.806
<i>Ooo-Ooo-Ooo</i>

01:38:10.885 --> 01:38:13.980
<i>Ohh, my Sharona</i>
