00:01.251 --> 00:02.585
<i>Previously on</i> Rescue Me...

00:02.585 --> 00:04.504
- Hiya, guys.
- Hey, what do you say, man...

00:04.504 --> 00:05.839
Gavin, have a drink with us.

00:05.839 --> 00:07.716
- Yeah, come on.
- No, no, no. I'm all right.

00:07.716 --> 00:10.260
- Then try this.
- No, I'm fine.

00:10.260 --> 00:11.761
What's with these guys?

00:11.761 --> 00:14.014
They showed up
for the shift like that.

00:14.014 --> 00:16.182
Think the party's been going
on for, like, three days.

00:16.182 --> 00:18.435
Cunningham, hey.
How are you doing, pal?

00:18.435 --> 00:19.853
You all right?

00:26.192 --> 00:27.652
You all right?

00:27.652 --> 00:30.071
- Is Nat all right?
- She has a new boyfriend.

00:30.071 --> 00:32.615
Next time they have a date
I can show you where.

00:32.615 --> 00:33.700
Oh, here she comes.

00:33.700 --> 00:36.870
This is the guy? Oh, my God,
you gotta be shittin' me.

00:36.870 --> 00:40.206
This is a joke. How about I walk over
there and pound Ashton Kutcher's face in?

00:40.331 --> 00:43.084
Hey, your new girlfriend came here
looking for you. Feinberg's daughter?

00:43.084 --> 00:45.211
- You take her out again.
- I'm not doing it.

00:45.211 --> 00:47.839
It's the right thing to do for your
relationship with Feinberg.

00:47.839 --> 00:50.800
<i>I mean, you take her out, you give her
a little kiss, give her a little feel.</i>

00:50.800 --> 00:52.719
Make her, you know,
think that you're interested.

00:52.719 --> 00:54.888
You know, I'm on
medication right now.

00:54.888 --> 00:56.306
I'm what you call bipolar.

00:56.431 --> 00:58.975
Listen, that card...
You can charge as much as you want.

00:59.100 --> 01:00.727
I want you to use it
for what you need.

01:00.852 --> 01:03.229
Birth control would be
on the need list, okay.

01:03.438 --> 01:06.441
Not stuff that you want.
Stuff that you want, you know,

01:06.441 --> 01:08.985
would be pretty much
anything your boyfriend says he needs.

01:09.110 --> 01:11.154
One night in
the not-too-distant future,

01:11.154 --> 01:14.115
my cousin Mike and I are gonna take
you out drinking.

01:14.115 --> 01:19.245
And if we notice that you like to drink
and get drunk, and drink to excess,

01:19.245 --> 01:22.165
and if you pass the Shea
cousins drinking exam,

01:22.165 --> 01:24.292
then you will
be called an alcoholic.

01:24.292 --> 01:26.002
Wow, okay, you're on.

01:26.503 --> 01:29.672
Hey, so "excess" is, like, how many
Long Island Iced Teas,

01:31.674 --> 01:33.176
Come on, shake
it off. Let's go.

01:33.176 --> 01:36.471
When I first started playing with Tommy,
he used to make me feel like that, man.

01:36.471 --> 01:38.598
But, I learned his,
like, weak points, you know.

01:38.598 --> 01:41.309
Look at that.
Black Shawn talking to Mike.

01:41.309 --> 01:44.145
Me and you, we're...
We're a lot alike, you know?

01:44.145 --> 01:46.606
- You'd say we were like bros?
- We like brothers.

01:46.731 --> 01:48.650
What'd you say
to Black Shawn before?

01:48.650 --> 01:51.319
You know I wouldn't
say anything bad, Tommy.

01:51.694 --> 01:54.114
I jumped off
a roof for you, asshole.

02:11.673 --> 02:13.466
Here. Hey, come on.

02:15.135 --> 02:17.887
Here.

02:44.873 --> 02:46.291
Hey, kid.

02:46.291 --> 02:47.625
Hey.

02:47.625 --> 02:50.253
Crew wanted to
welcome you aboard.

02:50.753 --> 02:51.754
Top shelf.

02:51.754 --> 02:55.091
Well, next to top shelf.
We're between paychecks.

02:55.091 --> 02:58.469
Holy shit. Thanks, man.

02:58.595 --> 03:01.181
That's one of the nicest
things anyone ever gave me.

03:01.181 --> 03:04.392
Booze.
The gift that gives back.

03:13.860 --> 03:14.861
Hey.

03:15.570 --> 03:16.863
Hey.

03:16.988 --> 03:18.656
What are you doing here?

03:18.781 --> 03:23.369
Uh, I was just filling out
some paperwork stuff.

03:23.369 --> 03:24.537
Cool.

03:24.537 --> 03:26.331
What's the bottle?

03:26.456 --> 03:27.749
Yeah.

03:27.749 --> 03:29.125
From the guys.

03:29.125 --> 03:31.461
Right.
Yeah.

03:31.461 --> 03:34.255
Those guys, uh...

03:37.800 --> 03:39.802
They like to drink
while they work, huh?

03:39.802 --> 03:41.804
Yeah, they're old school,
you know?

03:41.804 --> 03:44.098
Right. No, they--
T-t-they're good.

03:44.098 --> 03:47.185
They have a kind of a rep,
though. You know, these--

03:47.310 --> 03:49.604
You gotta keep your eye on
that, you know?

03:49.604 --> 03:51.898
Ha, ha. That's funny
coming from you, Tom.

03:52.023 --> 03:54.359
I'm not trying to be funny, Mike.
I'm just trying to say...

03:54.484 --> 03:57.695
I'm not your probie anymore, Tom.

03:57.820 --> 03:59.739
I know you're not
a probie anymore.

03:59.739 --> 04:02.533
I'm just trying to give you
a little friendly advice.

04:02.533 --> 04:06.037
- Okay, thanks.
- Well--

04:23.096 --> 04:24.222
- Hey.
- Hey!

04:24.222 --> 04:25.974
What's going on? Hey.

04:25.974 --> 04:28.017
- How are you doing?
- Good.

04:28.142 --> 04:29.852
I was just
in the neighborhood.

04:29.852 --> 04:30.979
I ran into Mike the probie.

04:30.979 --> 04:32.105
He said you were still here.

04:32.105 --> 04:34.399
Oh, yeah. Just filling out
some paperwork.

04:34.524 --> 04:36.484
I thought you might want
a ride home.

04:36.484 --> 04:38.903
No, I can't. I gotta get this
thing. I nev--

04:38.903 --> 04:40.446
Me and paperwork, you know.

04:40.446 --> 04:42.448
Probie smells like, uh,
cheap whiskey.

04:42.448 --> 04:45.159
I know. And by the way, you
can't call him "probie" anymore,

04:45.159 --> 04:46.369
now that he's graduated. So...

04:46.369 --> 04:48.413
- How about you?
- What?

04:48.538 --> 04:50.415
- You're not drinking?
- No, I'm not drinking.

04:50.540 --> 04:51.582
That's that crew, you know?

04:51.708 --> 04:53.793
They're trying to--
They're old school.

04:53.793 --> 04:55.753
Yeah, well,
you been there done that, huh?

04:55.753 --> 04:57.255
Yeah.

04:57.380 --> 05:00.258
So, what do you say? You want
to make a regular meeting?

05:00.258 --> 05:02.510
- No family except me?
- I got to be hon--

05:02.510 --> 05:05.263
I really don't think I'm
ready for, uh, normal alcoholics yet.

05:05.388 --> 05:06.514
You know what I mean?

05:06.514 --> 05:08.558
No finger-pointing,
no screaming, no yelling,

05:08.683 --> 05:11.185
no fist fights. I mean,
I'd just be bored shitless.

05:11.185 --> 05:12.854
- Alrighty.
- I gotta finish this stuff.

05:12.854 --> 05:14.731
- No, I hear you.
- Uh, I asked.

05:14.731 --> 05:17.775
- Right.
- I'll see you.

05:17.775 --> 05:20.194
Hey, let me, uh--
Can I ask you something?

05:20.194 --> 05:21.946
Yeah.

05:21.946 --> 05:26.117
Uh, I was watching one
of these, you know, religious channel--

05:26.242 --> 05:28.202
Just flipping through things.

05:28.202 --> 05:29.454
- Yeah? What?
- Wait.

05:29.579 --> 05:32.498
So I see this, uh, preacher
and he's talking about--

05:32.498 --> 05:34.584
Telling sort of how
when he saw the light.

05:34.584 --> 05:36.919
And then he starts taking,
like, a Q and A thing

05:37.045 --> 05:38.421
- with, like, the audience.
- Yeah.

05:38.421 --> 05:39.922
Um, the flock.

05:40.048 --> 05:41.841
And these people--
Six or seven people got up

05:41.841 --> 05:44.344
and told their story about how
they saw the light and then--

05:44.344 --> 05:46.346
Anyways, eventually
they're all singing that

05:46.346 --> 05:47.472
"I saw the light" song.

05:47.597 --> 05:48.765
Yes. Spielberg, uh, you know,

05:48.890 --> 05:50.641
ripped off God
with the bright light thing.

05:50.767 --> 05:52.435
Okay, you know what?
What's your point?

05:52.560 --> 05:55.313
My point is that you're just
so goddamn blind sometimes.

05:55.438 --> 05:56.898
- To what?
- To what?

05:56.898 --> 05:59.275
God's been giving you signs
for the past six years,

05:59.400 --> 06:00.735
and you've been
too drunk or too angry

06:00.735 --> 06:03.237
- or too crazy to see anything.
- I'm not drunk anymore.

06:03.237 --> 06:04.822
No, seriously.
Open up your eyes, moron.

06:04.947 --> 06:06.616
My eyes are open.
I've been sober for, uh--

06:06.741 --> 06:08.284
- Oh, you think so, huh?
- Yeah.

06:08.409 --> 06:09.786
You walked out of
the towers alive.

06:09.911 --> 06:11.287
- That would be number one.
- Oh, th--

06:11.412 --> 06:13.414
Not to mention you've been
having conversations

06:13.414 --> 06:15.583
with our dead cousin
for the past, what, six years?

06:15.583 --> 06:17.418
If that's not a sign,
I don't know what is.

06:17.418 --> 06:18.753
Okay.
You don't think that--

06:18.878 --> 06:20.338
I haven't gone down on my knees

06:20.463 --> 06:22.423
and asked for one more
conversation with Jimmy?

06:22.423 --> 06:23.966
You don't think
Sheila's done that?

06:24.092 --> 06:25.551
No, but he comes to you
over and over.

06:25.551 --> 06:26.886
Jimmy came to see me again,

06:26.886 --> 06:28.971
and told me he's not
coming to see me anymore.

06:29.097 --> 06:30.640
- Oh, he's not?
- Yeah, I got a new guy now.

06:30.765 --> 06:32.642
- Then maybe <i>that's</i> a sign.
- Yeah, I got a new guy.

06:32.767 --> 06:35.311
The reason that I know he's
kind of really showing up to me--

06:35.436 --> 06:37.688
- Yeah?
- He, uh--

06:37.814 --> 06:38.898
You want to talk about signs?

06:38.898 --> 06:40.775
He came and talked to me
about the Hail Mary.

06:40.775 --> 06:42.777
How about that?
And you know that's like--

06:42.777 --> 06:44.320
I have a big problem
with that--

06:44.320 --> 06:45.405
What?

06:47.115 --> 06:48.908
Oh, God.

06:51.327 --> 06:52.703
- Hey, baby.
- Hey.

06:52.829 --> 06:54.580
Mike went out
to clean the boat again.

06:54.580 --> 06:57.125
We got the whole afternoon
to destroy each other.

06:58.334 --> 06:59.585
We need to have a little chat.

06:59.836 --> 07:03.172
No, we need to chow down
and get it on.

07:03.297 --> 07:04.632
What's this?

07:04.841 --> 07:07.927
Spinach triangle ravioli
stuffed with creamed fava beans

07:07.927 --> 07:10.638
and smothered in
a brandy and lobster sauce.

07:10.847 --> 07:12.640
You're a cruel woman,
you know that?

07:12.849 --> 07:14.142
Come on,
you know you want it.

07:14.142 --> 07:16.394
Look, I'm-- I'm having some
trouble with this, Latrina.

07:16.394 --> 07:19.772
You know, I just don't think
I have the stomach for it anymore.

07:19.772 --> 07:21.482
Oh, I think you do.

07:21.607 --> 07:22.733
You know what
I'm talking about.

07:22.859 --> 07:25.111
You know, I'm Irish.
It's the whole guilt thing.

07:25.111 --> 07:27.155
I mean, Mike is my cousin.
He's family.

07:27.155 --> 07:29.031
That's why they call them
guilty pleasures.

07:29.157 --> 07:32.535
Whether it's food or good loving,

07:32.535 --> 07:36.205
without the guilt,
the pleasure's just not the same.

07:36.330 --> 07:40.084
Come on.
Just take one little bite.

07:42.170 --> 07:45.131
I can't. I can't.

07:46.507 --> 07:48.301
Hey, if you can't, you can't.

07:48.301 --> 07:49.427
Well, what are you doing?

07:49.552 --> 07:51.095
- Cleaning up this mess.
- Wait a minute.

07:51.220 --> 07:52.889
Why are you throwing
the triangle ravioli

07:53.014 --> 07:55.808
with creamed fava beans smothered
in lobster and brandy sauce away?

07:55.808 --> 07:57.977
- Don't do that!
- Don't do what?

07:57.977 --> 07:59.395
Please, don't throw it away?

07:59.520 --> 08:02.899
I don't throw it away,
what you gonna do for me?

08:09.030 --> 08:10.406
Mm-hm.

08:16.913 --> 08:19.582
<i>On another day
C'mon, c'mon</i>

08:19.582 --> 08:23.503
<i>With these ropes tied tight
Can we do no wrong?</i>

08:23.503 --> 08:26.172
<i>Now we grieve
'Cause now it's gone</i>

08:26.172 --> 08:29.258
<i>Things were good
When we were young</i>

08:29.509 --> 08:33.012
<i>When my teeth bite down
I can see the blood</i>

08:33.012 --> 08:35.806
<i>Of a thousand men
Who have come and gone</i>

08:35.932 --> 08:39.560
<i>Now we grieve
'Cause now it's gone</i>

08:39.560 --> 08:42.230
<i>Things were good
When we were young</i>

08:42.230 --> 08:45.858
<i>Is it safe to stay?
C'mon, c'mon</i>

08:45.858 --> 08:48.945
<i>Was it right to leave?
C'mon, c'mon</i>

08:48.945 --> 08:52.281
<i>Will I ever learn?
C'mon, c'mon</i>

08:52.532 --> 08:55.701
<i>C'mon, c'mon
C'mon, c'mon</i>

09:07.296 --> 09:08.631
Guys.

09:08.631 --> 09:10.883
I think we got some whack job
surfing the rig.

09:10.883 --> 09:12.176
What?

09:12.301 --> 09:14.971
I saw someone
on the back of the rig.

09:18.474 --> 09:20.560
Come on, Lar.
You're losing it.

09:20.560 --> 09:22.311
There nothing back there
but exhaust fumes.

09:22.562 --> 09:25.815
Chuck, we carrying
any unwanted passengers back there?

09:25.940 --> 09:27.817
<i>10-4, Lar.
We're catching up.</i>

09:29.318 --> 09:31.571
There.

09:42.665 --> 09:45.084
I thought I saw someone, Lar.
I can't be sure.

09:45.084 --> 09:47.545
Uh, chief, do us a favor
and drop back.

09:47.670 --> 09:49.755
I thought I saw somebody
on the back of the rig.

09:49.755 --> 09:51.966
Copy. Goddamn thrill seekers.

09:51.966 --> 09:54.218
Mike, slow down
so we can check it out.

10:05.229 --> 10:06.772
You're clean, Larry.

10:06.772 --> 10:10.985
You sure, Chief?
I, uh... could've swore I saw somebody.

10:10.985 --> 10:13.404
I said you're clean, Larry.

10:13.654 --> 10:15.573
Either you're out of your mind

10:15.698 --> 10:17.575
or you shook him on
the last corner.

10:17.700 --> 10:18.701
Copy.

10:26.292 --> 10:28.002
Hey, chief, where's the fire?

10:28.002 --> 10:29.420
Hey, sorry to disappoint you, boys.

10:29.670 --> 10:32.590
Looks like you're
going home clean. False alarm.

10:32.715 --> 10:34.884
False alarm, guys.
Back to quarters.

10:34.884 --> 10:36.761
Come on, Dave. Let's go.

10:37.720 --> 10:40.681
Looks like somebody better
ease off the firewater, huh?

10:45.770 --> 10:46.854
Hey.

10:46.854 --> 10:48.731
Hi.

10:48.731 --> 10:52.026
Pauly told me you were
out here waiting, so...

10:54.195 --> 10:56.656
I know you know
I'm seeing somebody.

10:56.656 --> 10:58.991
I caught you spying
the other day.

10:58.991 --> 11:02.036
You and Richie
aren't exactly the A-Team.

11:02.036 --> 11:03.412
Funny.

11:03.663 --> 11:05.373
Now you've softened me up
with some humor,

11:05.373 --> 11:07.792
you want to cut the chase?

11:07.917 --> 11:09.418
I have to go away.
Just for a week or so.

11:09.669 --> 11:11.379
I've got some interviews
lined up in Chicago.

11:11.379 --> 11:13.381
Congratulations.
Have a safe flight.

11:13.381 --> 11:15.758
Franco.

11:16.884 --> 11:18.719
Can you look after
Richie for me?

11:18.719 --> 11:21.263
Why don't you have your little
hipster boyfriend do it?

11:21.263 --> 11:22.765
Richie loves you.

11:22.765 --> 11:25.059
I know he doesn't feel
comfortable with anybody else.

11:25.059 --> 11:26.394
Then he can stay
at the center.

11:26.394 --> 11:28.396
Well, I would,
but he's been talking about

11:28.396 --> 11:30.773
wanting to marry that Barbara
girl in the wheelchair.

11:30.773 --> 11:32.650
I'm worried they're
gonna run off together.

11:32.775 --> 11:33.943
Seeing as how
she can't walk,

11:33.943 --> 11:35.236
they probably
won't get too far.

11:35.236 --> 11:37.446
Franco, please?

11:37.697 --> 11:39.448
Look, I don't want him
to make any mistakes.

11:39.573 --> 11:41.951
What, like we almost made?

11:42.201 --> 11:43.786
You know, you got
a lot of goddamn nerve

11:43.786 --> 11:45.371
coming here asking me
for a favor now.

11:45.371 --> 11:48.457
Well, fine. Then don't do it for me.
Do it for Richie.

11:48.582 --> 11:51.877
You care about him, right?
You want what's best for him.

11:54.422 --> 11:57.508
So these interviews--
I mean, what, you're gonna be moving?

11:57.758 --> 11:59.844
I'm exploring my options.

11:59.969 --> 12:01.470
Right.

12:01.721 --> 12:04.515
There are some good
things in Chicago.

12:04.765 --> 12:08.144
But there are some good things
here in New York. Like you.

12:08.144 --> 12:10.688
- Oh, here comes the butter.
- It's not butter.

12:10.813 --> 12:12.314
Look, I wanted to get married.

12:12.314 --> 12:15.693
I thought we would spend the
rest of our lives together,

12:15.818 --> 12:18.487
but right now I can't tell you
what I want anymore.

12:18.738 --> 12:21.365
So I'm gonna go to Chicago.
I'm gonna...

12:21.490 --> 12:24.368
take some time,
and I'm gonna figure that out.

12:24.493 --> 12:28.873
But for that to happen, I need
you to look after Richie.

12:28.998 --> 12:31.208
Please?

12:33.002 --> 12:35.838
- When are you leaving?
- Tomorrow.

12:37.798 --> 12:39.049
Yeah, all right.

12:39.175 --> 12:41.051
I'll pick him up from
the center after my shift.

12:41.177 --> 12:42.511
Happy?

12:42.762 --> 12:44.346
I still think about you.

12:44.346 --> 12:47.892
Me and you. Our thing.

12:57.359 --> 12:59.528
So I'm not even gonna
try to talk this time.

12:59.779 --> 13:02.364
We'll just--
I brought Fresca with me. So it's like--

13:02.364 --> 13:04.700
I don't know. What?
five minutes tops?

13:04.700 --> 13:06.494
Oh!

13:06.494 --> 13:08.537
Okay, three minutes.
We'll go three.

13:08.537 --> 13:09.622
Who is she?

13:10.122 --> 13:11.373
She?

13:11.499 --> 13:13.876
The girl that you had dinner
with in SoHo the other night.

13:13.876 --> 13:16.712
My friend Alex
is a waitress there, and just so you know,

13:16.712 --> 13:18.297
I have eyes and ears
all over the city.

13:18.297 --> 13:19.673
You can't get away
with anything.

13:19.673 --> 13:20.758
- Okay.
- And I know that

13:20.883 --> 13:23.052
you were kissing her
and I know that you felt her up.

13:23.177 --> 13:24.845
Feeling her up?
Who said I was feeling her up?

13:24.845 --> 13:25.971
Ow. That hurt.

13:25.971 --> 13:28.516
I was not--
Okay, let me explain.

13:28.516 --> 13:29.850
Let me explain, okay?

13:29.850 --> 13:31.894
It's gonna sound strange,
but it's true.

13:32.019 --> 13:34.855
My new chief at the firehouse,
h-h-he's Jewish.

13:34.855 --> 13:35.981
What was that?

13:35.981 --> 13:37.066
- I'm a Jew.
- Okay.

13:37.191 --> 13:38.734
- Well, I didn't know that.
- Ugh.

13:38.859 --> 13:41.070
- Listen to me. Listen. Listen.
- What? What?

13:41.070 --> 13:42.571
Why am I even
explaining myself?

13:42.822 --> 13:45.032
It's not like this
is like a relationship.

13:45.032 --> 13:46.158
- Like, you know, we--
- Oh.

13:46.158 --> 13:47.868
This this isn't a relationship?

13:47.868 --> 13:49.161
- Hmm.
- Yeah, w-- No.

13:49.161 --> 13:50.913
It's like a booty call.
That's what it is.

13:51.038 --> 13:52.915
And you're
complaining about this?

13:53.958 --> 13:55.835
Yeah, I know.
I know it sounds weird, but--

13:55.835 --> 13:57.419
You know, most guys
would think that is

13:57.419 --> 13:58.921
the perfect relationship.

14:03.592 --> 14:05.094
Y-you want a Fresca?

14:08.639 --> 14:09.849
Yeah?

14:09.849 --> 14:12.685
- <i>Is this Thomas Gavin?</i>
- Yeah.

14:12.810 --> 14:15.563
<i>Hi, I'm calling about your
MasterCard debit account.</i>

14:15.563 --> 14:18.107
<i>There are some charges we need
to verify on the card you have</i>

14:18.107 --> 14:19.859
<i>in Colleen Gavin's name.</i>

14:19.859 --> 14:21.652
Yeah?

14:21.777 --> 14:26.031
<i>Okay, there's a charge for
$2066 to The Noise Room,</i>

14:26.031 --> 14:31.704
<i>and another charge for 5475
to Gerstein Jewelers.</i>

14:31.704 --> 14:33.914
Holy shit.

14:33.914 --> 14:36.000
It's a recording studio
down in the Bowery, okay?

14:36.125 --> 14:37.918
Tony wanted to lay down
some acoustic stuff,

14:37.918 --> 14:39.712
but he didn't have money
for session time,

14:39.712 --> 14:41.630
so, you know, I told him
he could use the card.

14:41.630 --> 14:43.299
He's gonna pay me back though.

14:43.549 --> 14:45.342
<i>He's gonna pay me back,
is what you mean.</i>

14:45.467 --> 14:46.468
Whatever.

14:46.594 --> 14:48.596
What about this
jewelry store charge?

14:48.596 --> 14:51.015
- What jewelry store charge?
- Never mind.

14:52.182 --> 14:54.143
Did he buy me a ring?

14:54.143 --> 14:55.728
I'll tell you,
if he bought you a ring,

14:55.728 --> 14:57.104
I'm buying a gun, okay?

14:57.104 --> 14:58.314
Dad...

14:58.314 --> 14:59.857
I'll call you back later.

15:00.107 --> 15:01.317
Shit.

15:01.442 --> 15:05.195
He had all kinds of piercings.
Eyebrow, nose, ears, lip.

15:05.321 --> 15:07.406
He looked like all the guys
who come into this store.

15:07.406 --> 15:09.074
- Really?
- Oh, he was wearing

15:09.074 --> 15:11.535
- a Fake Baby Head T-shirt.
- That's the guy. That's the guy.

15:12.494 --> 15:14.872
Okay, here it is.
An anklet for 39.99

15:15.122 --> 15:16.790
and a ring for 5400
and change.

15:16.790 --> 15:19.043
- Jesus Christ, what was--?
- Did she like the ring?

15:19.168 --> 15:20.794
I don't know.
Was it a wedding ring?

15:20.794 --> 15:23.088
- No, it doesn't say.
- How do you not know?

15:23.088 --> 15:24.715
That's an expensive ring.
You know what?

15:24.840 --> 15:26.175
What?
We sell all kinds of rings.

15:26.300 --> 15:27.676
Engagement rings, wedding rings.

15:27.801 --> 15:29.178
Can I help you with anything else,

15:29.178 --> 15:30.888
'cause I have a
Frappuccino waiting for me.

15:31.013 --> 15:32.514
Oh, really?
Yeah, you can help me.

15:32.514 --> 15:34.892
Next time a guy comes in
with a Fake Baby Head T-shirt

15:34.892 --> 15:37.269
and a bunch of rings attached
to his nose and his eyebrows

15:37.269 --> 15:38.896
and he wants to buy
an ankle thing,

15:39.021 --> 15:40.856
maybe you should check
the name on the credit card

15:40.856 --> 15:42.650
before you sell it to him.
How about that?

15:42.650 --> 15:43.859
Okay, maybe I will.

15:43.859 --> 15:46.195
- Yeah, w--
- Have a good day.

15:46.195 --> 15:48.155
I hope your
Frappuccino's cold.

15:48.155 --> 15:50.824
It's supposed to be cold.

15:52.326 --> 15:53.786
Hey.
Hey.

16:03.087 --> 16:04.964
Is, uh, Tony around?

16:05.965 --> 16:08.258
He's recording
right now.

16:17.476 --> 16:19.937
Excuse me. Hey.

16:25.317 --> 16:26.360
He's so talented.

16:26.694 --> 16:28.278
He writes all his own songs.

16:28.278 --> 16:29.488
Who?

16:29.780 --> 16:32.241
Tony.

16:37.621 --> 16:39.665
You know
he can't even read music?

16:39.665 --> 16:40.916
Really?

16:41.166 --> 16:42.251
Yeah.

16:42.251 --> 16:47.256
But neither could John Lennon,
by the way.

16:47.256 --> 16:49.299
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

16:49.425 --> 16:51.135
Yeah.

16:51.260 --> 16:53.971
Where's Mark David Chapman
when you need him?

16:54.221 --> 16:55.514
- Hm?
- What?

16:55.514 --> 16:58.767
- What'd you say?
- Nothing.

16:58.892 --> 17:01.437
Is this, uh--?
I'm sorry. Is this...

17:01.437 --> 17:03.230
one of Tony's guitars?

17:03.355 --> 17:04.773
That one.

17:04.773 --> 17:07.192
- This one? Thank you.
- The acoustic.

17:19.496 --> 17:22.166
Hey! Whoa, man!

17:22.291 --> 17:23.959
Whoa! Chillax, man!
What are you doing?

17:24.209 --> 17:26.003
That guitar cost me
a lot of money.

17:26.003 --> 17:27.796
Whoa, whoa! Come on! Augh!

17:27.796 --> 17:28.922
Take it easy, man.

17:28.922 --> 17:30.799
My daughter's credit card.

17:30.799 --> 17:32.009
- Yo!
- You roll up $5000--

17:32.259 --> 17:35.345
What are you talking about?
That engagement ring or whatever it is.

17:35.471 --> 17:36.638
- I'm telling you.
- All right!

17:36.638 --> 17:38.182
You are not gonna
marry my daughter.

17:38.307 --> 17:39.558
There's no way in hell--!

17:39.558 --> 17:41.060
I'm not gonna marry
your daughter.

17:41.060 --> 17:43.020
What are you talking about?
All right, listen.

17:43.020 --> 17:44.730
I-i-i--

17:44.730 --> 17:46.148
What?
I got her--

17:46.148 --> 17:48.776
I bought the ring
for Janelle here.

17:48.901 --> 17:50.569
Look, we met a couple weeks
ago and we just--

17:50.569 --> 17:51.695
I don't know.

17:51.820 --> 17:53.822
It's been bliss, man.
Can you understand? Like--

17:53.822 --> 17:56.658
- Is that... the ring?
- Yes.

17:56.658 --> 17:58.577
- So you're marrying her?
- Yeah.

17:58.577 --> 17:59.995
Yeah. We're in love.

17:59.995 --> 18:02.498
Look, I was gonna tell Colleen.
I just... didn't get back.

18:02.498 --> 18:05.250
Cool. Congratulations, man.

18:05.250 --> 18:06.960
I'm really happy for you.

18:06.960 --> 18:08.420
That's awesome.

18:08.837 --> 18:09.922
That's great.
All right.

18:10.047 --> 18:11.673
All right, guys.
Well, good luck.

18:11.799 --> 18:13.801
And, uh, hey,
I hope you have kids.

18:13.801 --> 18:16.095
That's great.

18:16.345 --> 18:18.722
See you later. Hope the record
comes out good too.

18:23.185 --> 18:24.686
You know...

18:27.439 --> 18:29.399
the vice-principal
of this place

18:29.525 --> 18:31.652
happens to be a very close
friend of mine,

18:31.652 --> 18:36.323
and he was nice enough
to open his doors to us

18:36.323 --> 18:39.326
and allow us to have
our family meeting here.

18:43.205 --> 18:45.457
We're gonna have to
pass the basket, you know?

18:45.457 --> 18:48.210
Come up with enough money
to cover the damages.

18:50.546 --> 18:52.214
No more questions, okay?

18:52.422 --> 18:55.676
No more suggestions.
Just keep your hands down.

18:55.676 --> 18:57.719
Listen up.

18:57.719 --> 19:02.182
From now on, everybody
goes back to regular meetings.

19:03.642 --> 19:05.394
All of us, okay?

19:05.394 --> 19:07.479
All of us,
and I include myself,

19:07.479 --> 19:10.858
are not allowed to attend
meetings together for--

19:10.858 --> 19:13.861
I don't know.
Let's say three years.

19:13.861 --> 19:15.612
I just want to say one thing.

19:15.737 --> 19:17.906
You know, if sarcasm is
a character flaw

19:17.906 --> 19:19.408
then I might as well
go buy a gun,

19:19.408 --> 19:21.201
shoot myself
in the head right now.

19:21.201 --> 19:25.038
Yeah, well, sarcasm
is not just a character flaw.

19:25.289 --> 19:28.876
I told you, it's a trigger
to set off one of my character flaws,

19:28.876 --> 19:30.919
which is a tendency
towards violence.

19:31.044 --> 19:33.297
- What do you want me to do?
- Stop being sarcastic!

19:33.422 --> 19:35.716
Stop sucker-punching people
that say something funny.

19:35.716 --> 19:37.176
My weight problem
is funny to you?

19:37.176 --> 19:40.262
I have a bad heart.
I could drop dead right now.

19:40.387 --> 19:42.973
So go ahead. You'd lose
265 pounds in a second.

19:42.973 --> 19:44.850
Stop!

19:45.642 --> 19:47.436
Just stop!

19:50.939 --> 19:52.774
Yeah?

19:52.774 --> 19:53.942
Tom?

19:54.193 --> 19:56.653
It just so happens
that sarcasm and violence

19:56.778 --> 19:58.989
are both triggers for me, so--

19:58.989 --> 20:02.117
You know, what am I supposed
to do here? You know?

20:08.916 --> 20:10.709
Yeah, thank you.

20:11.168 --> 20:14.713
Just for the record,
and because it's a program of honesty,

20:14.713 --> 20:17.758
he really weighs 268, actually.

20:17.758 --> 20:18.842
- He does?
- Yeah.

20:18.842 --> 20:22.554
- God, he wears it so well.
- I know, right?

20:22.679 --> 20:24.556
Yeah, daddy.
Daddy needs his medicine.

20:24.556 --> 20:27.226
Let's get this party
started, huh, boys? Whoo!

20:27.226 --> 20:29.686
Yeah, this should be
a real early evening.

20:29.686 --> 20:31.313
It kinda smells
like stale beer in here.

20:31.438 --> 20:32.856
That's 'cause it's a bar.

20:32.981 --> 20:34.441
You wanna smell
candles and hair gel

20:34.441 --> 20:36.818
go down to Bungalow 8
with the rest of the posers.

20:36.818 --> 20:39.196
Wow. You guys eat something
before you joined us?

20:39.321 --> 20:41.990
- We had a couple burgers at the Bistro.
- Perfect.

20:42.241 --> 20:43.742
It's good to have
some food in your belly.

20:43.742 --> 20:46.411
This way when the puking starts
you got something to, you know,

20:46.411 --> 20:48.413
heave up instead of
the lining of your stomach.

20:48.413 --> 20:50.207
We'll have more tips
as the night goes on,

20:50.207 --> 20:53.210
like, um, advanced
urinal puking techniques.

20:53.335 --> 20:54.920
I don't mean to burst
your bubble, boys,

20:54.920 --> 20:58.548
but I don't need any tips,
okay? I'm full-blown as it is.

20:58.674 --> 21:01.218
Full blown beer queer, maybe.

21:01.343 --> 21:02.636
Who you calling
beer queer, pal?

21:02.636 --> 21:04.429
Yeah, and what is that,
by the way?

21:04.554 --> 21:06.807
- What is that?
- That's one of these guys

21:06.807 --> 21:09.226
who talks a good game
and then starts drinking

21:09.351 --> 21:11.478
and then he says,
"Oh, I love you so much."

21:11.478 --> 21:13.230
You know? Then he has
another couple of beers

21:13.230 --> 21:16.483
and before you know it
he's like, "Ugh. Oh, I love you, man."

21:16.483 --> 21:18.527
Look, pal,
I'm not a beer queer, okay?

21:18.527 --> 21:20.404
I mean, if anything, I'm a...

21:20.529 --> 21:22.823
I'm a beer steer, all right?
So you better watch yourself.

21:22.823 --> 21:24.950
You'll get a couple of horns
shoved up your ass.

21:24.950 --> 21:26.118
Wow.

21:26.118 --> 21:27.995
Steers are the ones
with horns, right?

21:27.995 --> 21:30.247
- I don't know, dude.
- You know what I say?

21:30.247 --> 21:34.042
I say we stop this idiocy
and stop talking and, uh, start drinking.

21:34.042 --> 21:35.210
- All right.
- All right, yeah.

21:35.210 --> 21:36.753
That's what I'm talking about.

21:36.753 --> 21:40.465
- Down the hatch.
- Here we go. Ready? Set?

21:45.012 --> 21:47.139
Oh! Yeah.

21:48.890 --> 21:50.267
Holy Christ.

21:55.355 --> 21:57.983
Man, I never thought these
words would cross my lips,

21:57.983 --> 22:01.320
but I'm definitely getting
too old for this shit, B.

22:01.320 --> 22:03.613
- What shit is that?
- This shit, you know?

22:03.739 --> 22:07.826
This place. These people.
I mean, what are they trying to prove?

22:08.243 --> 22:10.537
Well, that guy over there,

22:10.537 --> 22:13.290
he's trying to prove that
his joint still gets hard.

22:13.415 --> 22:17.044
It doesn't.
And that dude over there,

22:17.044 --> 22:18.920
he's trying to prove
that people like him

22:19.046 --> 22:22.174
for more than his money.
They don't.

22:22.174 --> 22:23.550
Yeah, well,
what about us?

22:23.550 --> 22:25.135
You know, what are
we trying to prove?

22:25.260 --> 22:26.803
I ain't trying to prove shit.

22:26.928 --> 22:30.724
I'm here cause the music is thumping
and the bitches is bumping.

22:30.724 --> 22:32.100
Okay, well, me then. All right?

22:32.100 --> 22:34.770
If you were standing here and
I was another one of these humps

22:34.770 --> 22:36.188
what would you say
I had to prove.

22:36.188 --> 22:38.357
Oh, that you don't give
two shits about Natalie

22:38.357 --> 22:40.108
and you can still
get your dick wet.

22:40.942 --> 22:42.903
- You're good.
- I know this.

22:43.028 --> 22:44.571
- Get me another drink.
- All right.

22:44.571 --> 22:45.655
All right.

22:58.668 --> 23:02.214
Listen, listen, listen. I was--
I was wrong about you, okay?

23:02.214 --> 23:06.843
If I were a steer, and a steer
was the one with horns,

23:07.094 --> 23:09.054
I would never stick them
up your ass.

23:09.054 --> 23:10.305
I would never do that to you.

23:10.305 --> 23:12.516
And as a matter of fact,
I know that I just met you,

23:12.641 --> 23:14.601
but I just-- I think--

23:14.601 --> 23:17.396
I think that you and I
should be best friends, okay?

23:17.396 --> 23:18.772
What did I tell you?
Beer queer.

23:18.772 --> 23:20.440
He's reached level two
in record time.

23:20.440 --> 23:21.900
That's not a good sign.

23:21.900 --> 23:23.527
There's no levels.
There's no levels.

23:23.527 --> 23:25.153
I don't even... whoa.

23:34.162 --> 23:35.330
Level three, coming up.

23:35.455 --> 23:37.707
She's a real prize, man.
Go talk to her.

23:37.833 --> 23:39.751
Yo, I-I don't know.
She's really pretty.

23:39.751 --> 23:41.753
Anybody that claims
to have a drinking problem

23:41.753 --> 23:43.296
has gotta pick up
a broad in a bar

23:43.296 --> 23:47.384
and bring her home and have drunken,
uninhibited, naked, bar sex.

23:47.509 --> 23:48.552
She's a total skank, dude.

23:48.677 --> 23:50.137
- Hey!
- Ow.

23:50.137 --> 23:52.848
- Watch how you talk about the lady.
- What's the matter with you?

23:52.848 --> 23:54.683
You wouldn't know a lady
if she sat on your face.

23:54.808 --> 23:56.059
Jackass.

23:56.184 --> 23:58.145
I saw her checking you out
when you came in.

23:58.145 --> 23:59.688
- Mm?
- Oh, yeah.

23:59.813 --> 24:02.649
- All right. I'm going in. I'm going in.
- Attaboy, Sean.

24:02.649 --> 24:05.360
Don't her looks intimidate you.
You're the man.

24:10.532 --> 24:12.784
- Hi.
- Hi.

25:26.858 --> 25:27.943
Oh, baby.

26:09.776 --> 26:11.111
Good morning.

26:12.153 --> 26:14.698
Good morning. Hi.

26:14.823 --> 26:17.409
- Hi.
- Hey, uh, lady.

26:17.409 --> 26:19.369
- How you doing?
- You're so silly.

26:19.494 --> 26:22.372
- Yeah, that's me.
- Is Captain Happy awake?

26:22.497 --> 26:24.791
Uh, no, actually
Captain Happy is very sleepy.

26:24.791 --> 26:27.252
Oh, no, I think
Captain Happy is awake.

26:27.252 --> 26:29.004
No, you know--
Oh, my God look at the time.

26:29.129 --> 26:31.339
You know what? I gotta get
to work. It's so late.

26:31.339 --> 26:32.757
I really should, uh--

26:32.757 --> 26:34.175
Ooh.

26:34.301 --> 26:37.053
Make yourself comfortable,
and we'll get together.

26:37.178 --> 26:41.016
- Oh. Should I leave my number?
- Yes, definitely.

26:41.016 --> 26:43.560
- I'll leave my number.
- Okay.

27:23.433 --> 27:24.684
You okay, ma'am?

27:25.852 --> 27:27.479
All right,
let's go this way.

27:32.067 --> 27:33.610
Hey, Cunningham,
take her down.

27:33.610 --> 27:35.779
Hey!

27:35.779 --> 27:39.032
Ho! You all right?

27:40.742 --> 27:41.826
Yo!

27:47.999 --> 27:50.210
Shit.

28:06.434 --> 28:07.936
Hello?

28:07.936 --> 28:09.020
Blair, hit that.

28:09.020 --> 28:11.106
Let's go.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

28:11.106 --> 28:13.900
Anybody in here? FDNY!
Anybody here?

28:15.402 --> 28:16.403
- Got it?
- Yeah, yeah.

28:16.403 --> 28:18.279
- Got that?
- I got it, I got it.

28:18.279 --> 28:20.198
Here, check the other room.
I think we're clear.

28:21.366 --> 28:24.327
Okay, get your masks on.

28:24.452 --> 28:26.037
Get your masks on.

28:26.037 --> 28:28.123
- Hey, the door's blocked.
- Mayday! Mayday!

28:28.248 --> 28:31.626
This is Truck 62 on the fourth floor.
What direction is that window facing?

28:31.626 --> 28:34.671
Exposure 2 side!
Exposure 2!

28:34.671 --> 28:36.798
We could sure use a ladder
right about now.

28:36.798 --> 28:38.049
What do we got?

28:40.135 --> 28:41.761
Hey, Mike,
check over in there.

28:41.761 --> 28:43.680
Somebody's cleaning it.
Hang on.

28:43.680 --> 28:44.931
Can we get out?

28:46.641 --> 28:48.143
Someone's cleaning it.

28:48.143 --> 28:51.020
Dudes, if you got a ladder,
this would be a really good time.

28:51.020 --> 28:52.647
What the hell is that?

28:52.647 --> 28:54.899
Clear! It's clear.

28:54.899 --> 28:56.693
Let's go!

28:58.069 --> 28:59.612
No other exits. Clear!

29:19.132 --> 29:23.094
No vitamins or pomegranates
but still goes down smooth.

29:25.847 --> 29:26.931
What's wrong?

29:26.931 --> 29:28.266
Nothing.

29:28.266 --> 29:31.352
Shit. Yanks lose?

29:31.352 --> 29:33.354
Goddamn Clemens.
He's too goddamn old.

29:33.480 --> 29:34.773
I was saying that
five years ago.

29:35.023 --> 29:37.066
What?

29:38.193 --> 29:40.403
I think I saw...

29:40.570 --> 29:43.239
This is gonna sound
so screwed up.

29:43.490 --> 29:45.074
I saw a guy making a save.

29:46.701 --> 29:48.995
He was carrying this guy
down the hallway.

29:49.120 --> 29:51.039
It was all smoky
and everything,

29:51.039 --> 29:54.167
but I caught
the name on the jacket.

29:54.375 --> 29:55.502
Keefe.

29:55.502 --> 29:57.504
Jimmy goddamn Keefe.

30:02.050 --> 30:04.594
I'm Section Eight.
I'm Section Eight, right?

30:04.594 --> 30:08.640
That day I thought I saw
someone on the back of the rig.

30:08.640 --> 30:11.059
Chucky said
he saw something too.

30:11.226 --> 30:15.480
Made me swear
I wouldn't tell nobody, but...

30:15.480 --> 30:17.065
he saw the same thing.

30:17.065 --> 30:20.109
- Did he see his face?
- No.

30:20.235 --> 30:22.153
No, it was there,
and then it was gone.

30:22.278 --> 30:24.489
Like it was a...

30:24.489 --> 30:27.492
I don't know,
a ghost or something.

30:27.617 --> 30:30.161
A ghost?
What kind of bullshit is that?

30:30.286 --> 30:33.164
Chucky's a lush.
He's got wet-brain.

30:35.625 --> 30:37.460
Hey, it's probably
nothing, right?

30:37.585 --> 30:39.128
Come on, you're in a fire.

30:39.128 --> 30:40.296
The adrenaline's pumping,

30:40.296 --> 30:43.591
there's shit happening
all around you, it's dark, it's smoky,

30:43.591 --> 30:46.135
your eyes play tricks on you.

30:54.185 --> 30:58.189
You, uh, want some
coffee or something?

30:59.816 --> 31:02.235
Give me Shaq, T-Mac, LeBron,

31:02.235 --> 31:05.071
Arenas, and A.I.
on the same team--

31:05.071 --> 31:07.031
Man, it's the
championship, baby.

31:07.031 --> 31:08.825
- Tommy Gavin around?
- Hey, Coll.

31:08.825 --> 31:12.328
Um, yeah, yeah.
He's somewhere inside.

31:13.955 --> 31:15.665
- Hey, Coll.
- Hey.

31:15.915 --> 31:18.376
Tommy's hittin' kinda young,
ain't he?

31:18.376 --> 31:20.128
Easy, killer.

31:20.128 --> 31:21.588
That's his daughter.

31:21.588 --> 31:23.006
Verboten.

31:24.173 --> 31:25.633
Means "don't."

31:26.968 --> 31:28.928
I know what it means.

31:31.097 --> 31:32.098
Hey.

31:34.309 --> 31:37.896
Yeah, I know, I know.
Hey, I know. I know.

31:37.896 --> 31:40.523
Honey, you're gonna-- You're
gonna meet somebody else.

31:40.773 --> 31:42.567
Listen. Shh.

31:42.567 --> 31:45.486
It's-- Oh!
What are you kicking me for?

31:45.486 --> 31:47.906
For sticking your nose in my
own personal goddamn business.

31:48.072 --> 31:49.490
I was trying to help you.

31:49.490 --> 31:51.367
I was in love with him, Dad, okay?

31:51.367 --> 31:53.328
He's getting married
to another chick, okay?

31:53.328 --> 31:55.288
He bought her a wedding ring
with your--

31:55.413 --> 31:57.540
Ow! Jeez.

31:57.749 --> 32:00.043
Stop it. What? Ow.

32:00.043 --> 32:01.252
But he's not here anymore.

32:01.377 --> 32:02.545
Now I gotta go find
someone else.

32:02.754 --> 32:05.089
- All right, listen to me.
- I don't know what you did.

32:05.214 --> 32:08.426
Ow! Jesus! Ugh!

32:12.805 --> 32:14.766
Colleen.

32:14.766 --> 32:16.142
Hey.

32:16.267 --> 32:17.477
Colleen.

32:17.602 --> 32:19.979
Missy. Young lady?

32:22.523 --> 32:25.026
You know, she kicked me
in the shins three times.

32:25.026 --> 32:26.819
- Unbelievable.
- Tom, quick suggestion.

32:26.945 --> 32:28.112
- Yeah.
- If you wanna take steps

32:28.112 --> 32:30.573
to really improve
your relationship with your daughter,

32:30.573 --> 32:32.450
not to mention with
your soon-to-be-ex-wife,

32:32.450 --> 32:33.576
- two words:
- Yeah?

32:33.576 --> 32:34.661
shin guards.

32:34.786 --> 32:35.995
- So funny.
- Gavin.

32:36.120 --> 32:37.455
My office. Now. Come on.

32:37.455 --> 32:38.581
What's up?

32:38.706 --> 32:41.042
- Get your ass up here.
- What's going on?

32:41.167 --> 32:43.127
- Tell me here.
- Want everybody to know?

32:43.252 --> 32:45.380
Know what? I got no
problem with you, Sid.

32:45.380 --> 32:47.298
The night you took my
daughter out on that date...

32:47.298 --> 32:48.424
Ahem. Yeah?

32:48.549 --> 32:50.718
- She said you molested her.
- What?

32:52.261 --> 32:53.930
You guys wanna
give us some, uh--?

32:53.930 --> 32:55.431
No, I'm good right here.

32:55.431 --> 32:57.183
My daughter,
my only child, huh?

32:57.392 --> 32:59.727
And you grope her on this date
like she's street trash.

32:59.727 --> 33:01.062
Wait, wait, wait.

33:01.062 --> 33:03.022
Grope?
Grope.

33:03.022 --> 33:05.233
Gro-- I, uh--

33:05.358 --> 33:07.068
What are you looking over here?

33:07.068 --> 33:09.237
- I-- I said grope.
- Okay.

33:09.362 --> 33:10.738
You're the one with grabby hands.

33:10.738 --> 33:11.823
- I-- Grabby?
- Yeah.

33:11.823 --> 33:13.241
We're do--
Is this what she said?

33:13.366 --> 33:16.035
These are the words I'm using.
You're the one with grabby hands.

33:16.035 --> 33:17.578
- No, no, no.
- No? Try to explain it.

33:17.704 --> 33:18.913
Tell me what happened.

33:19.038 --> 33:21.499
Okay. We went out to a bar.
A very nice, classy bar.

33:21.624 --> 33:23.251
- And I hugged her.
- Oh, come on.

33:23.376 --> 33:24.377
It was a hug.

33:24.377 --> 33:26.671
- Hey, listen to me. It was a hug.
- Yeah.

33:26.671 --> 33:28.840
I don't know what she
told you. That's what it was.

33:28.840 --> 33:32.010
And my hand accidentally
brushed up aga--

33:32.010 --> 33:33.469
On the front of her.

33:33.594 --> 33:35.054
- And she felt weird about it.
- Weird?

33:35.054 --> 33:36.597
You're saying my daughter is weird?

33:36.723 --> 33:37.932
- I'm--
- Huh?

33:38.057 --> 33:39.392
I didn't say your daughter was weird.

33:39.392 --> 33:42.103
She felt strange about it.
Oh, now she's strange.

33:42.103 --> 33:43.229
- Yes.
- Yes.

33:43.229 --> 33:46.024
Because my hand happened to
touch her tit and that why--

33:46.024 --> 33:47.525
What?

33:47.525 --> 33:49.736
- What?
- Tit.

33:49.736 --> 33:52.363
- Uh, I didn't say tit.
- You said tit.

33:52.363 --> 33:54.032
Don't look at him.
You said tit.

33:54.032 --> 33:56.284
Okay, that was an accident.
I meant to say breast.

33:56.284 --> 34:00.038
My hand happened to--
Against her-- She's got beautiful breasts.

34:02.790 --> 34:03.875
Hey, calm down.

34:03.875 --> 34:05.710
I'm gonna run
your narrow mick ass.

34:05.710 --> 34:08.087
I'm telling you, every second
of every day from now on.

34:08.087 --> 34:10.089
All right, chief, hold up.
I tried to explain.

34:10.214 --> 34:11.883
First of all, the mick thing:

34:11.883 --> 34:13.593
I don't take personal
'cause I'm Dutch,

34:13.593 --> 34:15.094
but you should watch
what you say.

34:15.094 --> 34:16.971
I don't think you should be
breaking Tommy's balls.

34:17.096 --> 34:18.723
You asked him to
take your daughter out.

34:18.723 --> 34:20.558
- That's true.
- You put him in a tough spot.

34:20.558 --> 34:22.226
Not to mention it was
very unprofessional.

34:22.226 --> 34:24.228
I didn't think he was gonna
manhandle her tits.

34:24.228 --> 34:26.189
Wait a minute.
It was one tit.

34:26.189 --> 34:27.982
- Oh, come on.
- All right. Hey.

34:27.982 --> 34:30.151
What do you want? You set
her up with Jack The Ripper,

34:30.276 --> 34:32.528
you can't cry foul when she
comes home without her head.

34:32.653 --> 34:34.030
- Hey, hey, hey.
- I'm defending you.

34:34.155 --> 34:35.615
- Doesn't sound like it.
- Oh, come on.

34:35.615 --> 34:37.241
You don't know
what's going on. Okay?

34:37.241 --> 34:39.160
My badge says chief too, okay?

34:39.160 --> 34:40.411
Now you're a chief, huh?

34:40.411 --> 34:41.746
If it wasn't for 9/11,

34:41.996 --> 34:43.998
you wouldn't be wearing
that white shirt at work.

34:43.998 --> 34:46.084
So don't try to teaching me
about firehouse ethics.

34:46.084 --> 34:48.086
And stay out of things
you know nothing about.

34:48.086 --> 34:49.462
Back off.

34:49.462 --> 34:51.172
- I've been checking up on you.
- Oh, yeah?

34:51.172 --> 34:52.340
- I know all about you.
- Yeah?

34:52.465 --> 34:53.633
I checked with Ron Perrolli.

34:53.633 --> 34:56.511
Ron Perrolli's
the biggest asshole in the department.

34:56.636 --> 34:58.513
- I checked with him.
- This is the guy you go to?

34:58.513 --> 35:00.681
I figured I would come in
here, I'd be a nice guy.

35:00.807 --> 35:03.434
- You know, try to be nice.
- The nice guy speech, yeah.

35:03.434 --> 35:05.311
- But that's never gonna happen.
- Oh, well--

35:05.311 --> 35:08.189
From now on, there are rules around here
and we're gonna follow 'em.

35:08.189 --> 35:09.941
I hope one of 'em's not
dating your daughter.

35:09.941 --> 35:11.109
- And...
- What?

35:11.109 --> 35:13.444
You touch my daughter again
or even see her--

35:13.444 --> 35:14.570
- Uh-huh.
- I'll crucify you.

35:15.029 --> 35:16.447
Okay. I touch
your daughter again,

35:16.447 --> 35:18.199
- I'm gonna crucify myself.
- You son of a--

35:22.453 --> 35:23.538
One more move!

35:23.663 --> 35:25.039
- Yeah, yeah.
- It's over! Walk away!

35:25.039 --> 35:27.375
Jesus Christ. Huh.

35:27.375 --> 35:29.252
You believe this guy?

35:29.377 --> 35:31.337
- Well, look at it this way?
- What?

35:31.337 --> 35:35.049
You might have grabby hands,
but at least you're not Dutch.

35:35.049 --> 35:36.467
- What?
- Nothing.

35:36.467 --> 35:39.011
Who the hell's Dutch?
Where's that come from?

35:39.011 --> 35:41.389
My mother was part Dutch.

35:48.146 --> 35:49.438
'Sup, bro?

35:50.815 --> 35:52.650
We're not bros, bro.

35:53.609 --> 35:56.612
- What's your problem, man?
- What's <i>your</i> problem?

35:56.737 --> 35:59.323
- I asked you first.
- Well, I asked you second.

35:59.323 --> 36:00.575
Yeah, but I asked you first.

36:00.575 --> 36:03.452
All right, if you want
to know so bad, I'll tell you.

36:03.452 --> 36:05.496
You tricked me into telling you

36:05.496 --> 36:07.248
all Tommy's weaknesses
in street hockey

36:07.373 --> 36:09.167
and then you used it
against him.

36:09.167 --> 36:10.668
I didn't trick you
into doing shit.

36:10.668 --> 36:12.336
- Yeah, you did.
- No, no, no, I didn't.

36:12.336 --> 36:14.422
You offered that information
up all on your own.

36:14.547 --> 36:17.341
Listen, man.
Let's cut the shit.

36:17.341 --> 36:20.094
Real talk. Deep down...

36:20.094 --> 36:21.345
you hate Tommy Gavin.

36:21.345 --> 36:22.805
- I do?
- Yeah.

36:22.930 --> 36:25.057
'Cause he's taught you
everything you know

36:25.057 --> 36:26.184
about being a firefighter,

36:26.184 --> 36:28.186
and the fact that he's
had to save your sorry ass

36:28.186 --> 36:30.104
on more than one occasion.

36:30.104 --> 36:31.606
But deep down,

36:31.606 --> 36:33.399
despite the fact
that he's a egomaniacal,

36:33.399 --> 36:37.111
self-centered son of a bitch,
you want to be just like him.

36:37.236 --> 36:41.073
Yeah,
you want to be Tommy Gavin.

36:41.073 --> 36:42.658
You want to be
exactly what you hate.

36:42.783 --> 36:44.285
And that's some sad shit.

36:44.410 --> 36:45.786
- Screw you, probie.
- Hey, hey, hey.

36:49.916 --> 36:52.293
What? What you want to do?
Huh? You wanna do something?

36:52.293 --> 36:54.420
- Move!
- Bring it, probie.

36:54.545 --> 36:56.881
What you want to do?
You want to do something?

36:56.881 --> 36:57.965
Let it go.

36:58.090 --> 37:00.134
Let me go. Let me tell you,
this ain't over, punk.

37:00.134 --> 37:02.511
- No, it's not over, probie!
- I'm gonna catch you, bitch.

37:02.637 --> 37:04.013
You better watch your ass.

37:04.013 --> 37:06.432
- Yeah, whatever.
- Yeah. That's what's up.

37:06.432 --> 37:07.892
Yeah, go home, probie.

37:07.892 --> 37:09.977
So you want to be
like Tommy Gavin, huh?

38:36.397 --> 38:38.566
FDNY, wake up, people!

38:38.691 --> 38:40.067
FDNY.

38:45.239 --> 38:48.451
All right, Mikey, Brian,
check out this last door,

38:48.576 --> 38:50.786
and then check out the
hallway, all right?

38:50.911 --> 38:52.538
- You got it, Lou.
- Cunningham, Davey, uh,

38:52.538 --> 38:54.123
see if there's a way
up to 2 down there.

38:54.248 --> 38:56.042
There may be a staircase.
Check it out for me.

38:56.042 --> 38:57.793
FDNY, people!

38:57.793 --> 39:01.422
Let's go, folks. Anybody here?
Here, check that door.

39:03.090 --> 39:04.425
- Let's go!
- Hey, I got one.

39:04.425 --> 39:05.760
You all right?

39:05.760 --> 39:06.844
<i>- Si.</i>
- Come with us.

39:06.844 --> 39:08.721
We'll get you
right out of here.

39:08.721 --> 39:10.598
You gotta get out!

39:19.065 --> 39:20.274
Hello?

39:24.487 --> 39:26.072
Hello?

39:31.744 --> 39:32.953
Hi.

39:33.079 --> 39:34.121
How you doing?

39:35.414 --> 39:37.041
You're a fireman.

39:37.041 --> 39:39.377
Yeah, yeah,
I-I am, yeah.

39:39.377 --> 39:42.046
Um, I'm gonna need you
to come with me, okay?

39:42.046 --> 39:43.756
- No big thing.
- What's going on?

39:43.964 --> 39:45.633
It's just a little smoky, so...

39:45.758 --> 39:48.010
- Is there a fire?
- If you don't mind, ma'am--

39:48.135 --> 39:50.721
- Save me.
- Okay. All right.

39:50.971 --> 39:52.765
Here's the thing, ma'am.
I just--

39:52.973 --> 39:54.475
- My name is Meg.
- Hi, Meg. How you doing?

39:54.600 --> 39:57.311
- Hi. What's your name?
- My name? My name is Bobby.

39:57.311 --> 39:58.479
- Bobby?
- Yes.

39:58.479 --> 39:59.980
I like you, Bobby.

40:00.106 --> 40:03.442
- Okay, we're just gonna walk--
- Kiss me.

40:03.567 --> 40:05.986
Okay. You know--
All right, Meg, come here.

40:06.112 --> 40:07.488
- Mmm.
- How was that?

40:07.613 --> 40:09.198
Was that good?
Mmm, that's good, yeah.

40:09.323 --> 40:11.492
Okay, hang on now, Meg.
Hang on. Here we go.

40:11.492 --> 40:14.995
Oh, shit. All right,
hang on, Meg, hang on.

40:14.995 --> 40:17.498
All right, hang on, sweetheart.
Here we go.

40:17.623 --> 40:19.625
- Meg?
- Yeah?

40:19.625 --> 40:23.129
We need to find a door, sweetheart.
Is there a door this way?

40:24.338 --> 40:26.048
Meg?

40:26.173 --> 40:29.260
Come on, sweetheart.
Let's go. Let's go.

40:32.430 --> 40:34.807
- Mmm, okay, Meg.
- Yeah?

40:35.015 --> 40:36.684
Is there a door
in this room, sweetheart?

40:36.809 --> 40:38.394
- Uh-huh.
- Huh? Is there?

40:38.519 --> 40:39.979
Where? Okay.

40:39.979 --> 40:41.105
Ah.

40:41.105 --> 40:44.024
Oh, Meg, Meg.
Meg, listen to me.

40:44.024 --> 40:45.359
Okay, now, come here.

40:45.484 --> 40:47.361
- Okay.
- What?

40:47.486 --> 40:48.571
Yeah.

40:50.948 --> 40:52.032
Okay.

40:52.032 --> 40:53.993
Hey. Hey.

40:53.993 --> 40:55.161
Mmm.
Mmm.

40:55.161 --> 40:57.079
Mm-hm, mm-hm.

41:04.211 --> 41:05.421
Oh!

41:05.546 --> 41:06.964
- Oh, my God.
- Like that?

41:06.964 --> 41:08.424
No, oh, my God!

41:08.549 --> 41:11.260
Aw, shit. Goddamn it.
What did I tell you?

41:17.391 --> 41:20.060
<i>There is no morphine</i>

41:20.060 --> 41:23.314
<i>I'm only sleeping</i>

41:23.314 --> 41:28.486
<i>There is no crime
To dreams like this</i>

41:28.486 --> 41:34.825
<i>And if you could take
Something with you</i>

41:35.075 --> 41:37.286
<i>It would be bright</i>

41:41.207 --> 41:46.504
<i>One day a ship comes in</i>

41:46.504 --> 41:52.259
<i>From far away
A ship comes in</i>

41:52.384 --> 41:57.765
<i>One hundred days
You wait for it</i>

41:57.765 --> 42:01.435
<i>And you know somewhere</i>

42:01.560 --> 42:05.689
<i>The ship comes in every day</i>

42:08.192 --> 42:11.487
<i>One day a ship comes in</i>

42:14.490 --> 42:19.161
<i>One hundred days
You wait for it</i>

42:20.871 --> 42:22.456
Oh, my God.

42:22.581 --> 42:24.166
Thank you.

42:24.291 --> 42:26.585
Thank you.
That was...

42:26.794 --> 42:28.587
Shit. Hey!

42:28.796 --> 42:31.215
Lady, you all right?

42:31.215 --> 42:32.591
I don't know.

42:32.800 --> 42:34.802
Jeez. Come on, come on.

42:35.886 --> 42:37.930
Come on, come on.

42:37.930 --> 42:39.390
So how'd you get out?

42:39.390 --> 42:40.766
Coming through.

42:40.766 --> 42:43.018
This really cute fireman saved me.

42:43.143 --> 42:47.106
He was tall and handsome
with kind of sandy hair,

42:47.106 --> 42:48.941
and he was kinda sweet.

42:48.941 --> 42:52.444
Cute, tall, handsome,
sandy hair? Sounds like Gavin.

42:52.444 --> 42:54.613
She said he was
kind of sweet, asshole.

42:54.613 --> 42:56.532
What are you,
queer or something?

43:00.327 --> 43:03.330
<i>One day a ship comes in</i>

43:06.834 --> 43:09.920
<i>It's good</i>

43:09.920 --> 43:12.298
<i>When it's something good</i>

43:24.852 --> 43:27.646
<i>There is no morphine</i>

43:27.855 --> 43:31.025
<i>I'm only sleeping</i>

43:31.150 --> 43:36.822
<i>There is no crime
To dreams like this</i>

43:36.822 --> 43:42.369
<i>And if you could
Take something with you</i>

43:42.369 --> 43:47.875
<i>It would be bright</i>

43:48.000 --> 43:50.544
<i>Something good</i>
