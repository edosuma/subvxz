Episode Title : <font color=#FFFF00>"Keeper of the Spire"</font>

00:42.738 --> 00:44.194
They've been at it
for a while.

00:44.281 --> 00:45.620
What could they
be talking about?

00:45.707 --> 00:47.002
Shh! I'm trying
to eavesdrop!

00:47.089 --> 00:48.916
You know I can
read lips, right?

00:49.003 --> 00:52.270
"Follow your dust to me."

00:52.464 --> 00:54.041
Follow my destiny?

00:54.128 --> 00:56.596
How is this supposed
to tell me my destiny

00:56.683 --> 00:58.144
if I can't read it?

00:58.231 --> 01:01.020
Find your next scroll piece
at the Spire.

01:01.128 --> 01:04.092
And the Keeper
will take you to it.

01:10.191 --> 01:11.619
Is this it?

01:11.706 --> 01:13.209
The Keeper's place?

01:13.296 --> 01:15.080
Let's find out.

01:16.823 --> 01:18.117
Stay together.

01:18.204 --> 01:20.315
Well, we are on a
narrow, elevated road,

01:20.402 --> 01:22.662
so I'm not seeing
too many other options.

01:25.861 --> 01:28.068
It's too quiet.
I don't like it.

01:28.678 --> 01:30.170
What is that?!

01:34.148 --> 01:35.854
Hang in there, buddy.

01:42.587 --> 01:43.954
Uh, hello?

01:45.142 --> 01:47.496
Bugs! Moths!

01:53.821 --> 01:55.517
H-Hi.

01:55.651 --> 01:57.695
Um, my name is Rapunzel.

01:57.782 --> 01:59.637
- Um, and I'm Lance.
- Shh!

01:59.751 --> 02:02.414
And I am looking for the...

02:02.501 --> 02:04.664
Keeper of the Spire?

02:04.751 --> 02:06.789
Look no further!

02:06.876 --> 02:08.633
I am the Keeper...

02:12.525 --> 02:13.766
Swallowed a moth. Again.

02:14.375 --> 02:15.703
Let me start over.

02:17.611 --> 02:21.348
I am the
Keeper of the Spire!

02:21.634 --> 02:23.673
But you can call me...

02:23.760 --> 02:25.446
Calliope.

02:26.111 --> 02:27.358
Not what I expected,

02:27.445 --> 02:28.858
but okay.

02:31.691 --> 02:34.571
So, what can the Keeper
do for you?

02:34.658 --> 02:36.387
Actually, you see,

02:36.597 --> 02:38.461
I heard you might
be able to help me.

02:38.548 --> 02:40.219
As Keeper of the Spire,

02:40.306 --> 02:42.328
I have been
entrusted wardship

02:42.415 --> 02:44.061
over the Spire's artifacts.

02:46.119 --> 02:47.275
Huh?

02:47.712 --> 02:49.688
It is my sworn duty

02:49.775 --> 02:50.969
to prevent these items

02:51.056 --> 02:53.071
from falling into
the wrong hands.

02:53.158 --> 02:55.973
And to protect them
from the outside world.

02:56.060 --> 02:57.399
Or in some cases,

02:57.486 --> 03:00.746
protect the outside world
from them!

03:00.901 --> 03:03.809
So I'm kinda prestigious.

03:04.798 --> 03:06.601
Oh! Wow!

03:06.688 --> 03:08.387
That is impressive.

03:08.474 --> 03:10.944
So I heard
you could help me

03:11.031 --> 03:12.469
get the third piece
of a scroll.

03:12.556 --> 03:13.711
Which scroll?

03:13.798 --> 03:15.172
There's the
Scroll of Danbury,

03:15.259 --> 03:16.992
uh, the Pavel Scroll,

03:17.079 --> 03:18.771
the Scroll of
Tannengier...

03:18.858 --> 03:20.656
Which isn't
technically a scroll,

03:20.743 --> 03:22.191
more of a brochure.

03:22.278 --> 03:24.271
Oh! This one.

03:25.127 --> 03:27.854
Oh, ho, ho, ho!
That scroll.

03:27.941 --> 03:29.414
That's in the
Spire's Vault.

03:29.501 --> 03:30.547
Great!

03:30.634 --> 03:32.422
So where is
the Spire's Vault?

03:32.509 --> 03:33.586
Spire.

03:33.673 --> 03:34.854
Excuse me?

03:34.941 --> 03:36.531
It's pronounced "spire."

03:36.618 --> 03:38.101
It comes from "speira."

03:38.188 --> 03:40.157
It's Latin, which is
another language

03:40.244 --> 03:41.827
that I actually speak.

03:41.914 --> 03:43.327
Oh! Yeah! Got it.

03:43.414 --> 03:45.694
Where is the
"Spire's" Vault?

03:45.781 --> 03:47.274
No, no, no.
Spy-err!

03:47.361 --> 03:48.668
Do you hear the difference?

03:48.755 --> 03:50.024
Spy-your.

03:50.111 --> 03:52.424
- Spy-err.
- Spy-your!

03:52.511 --> 03:54.894
Like this! Spy-your!

03:54.981 --> 03:57.031
- Spy-your!
- Do you have the scroll or not?

03:57.118 --> 03:58.363
Cass! Please!

03:58.450 --> 03:59.605
No, I get it.

03:59.692 --> 04:01.223
Moms can be impatient.

04:01.310 --> 04:04.137
Mom?! I'm four years
older than her!

04:04.224 --> 04:05.737
Oh. I saw
the crow's feet,

04:05.824 --> 04:07.077
and I just assumed.

04:09.522 --> 04:10.524
Swalled a moth.

04:10.611 --> 04:13.113
At least your head
isn't as weird as his.

04:13.200 --> 04:14.971
Hey, slowpokes,
let's go!

04:16.726 --> 04:19.339
Another moth!
I'm fine! Nobody worry!

04:19.872 --> 04:21.894
This is the library!

04:21.982 --> 04:24.150
And yes, I've read
all these books,

04:24.237 --> 04:25.440
if you're wondering.

04:25.527 --> 04:27.527
I just have to grab the Vault's map.

04:27.722 --> 04:30.947
The Spire's Vault holds
hundreds of the rarest,

04:31.034 --> 04:34.644
most abstruse artifacts
from all over the globe.

04:35.901 --> 04:38.742
I noticed you were eying
my linking rings.

04:38.829 --> 04:42.749
I am something of a
master illusionist!

04:45.731 --> 04:47.918
Ta-da!

04:52.111 --> 04:53.300
Uh, no.

04:53.387 --> 04:54.774
Thank you!

04:54.861 --> 04:57.276
Did I hear someone
say encore?

04:57.363 --> 04:59.357
- You most certainly did not.
- Cass!

04:59.444 --> 05:01.164
It's just one more trick.

05:01.251 --> 05:02.948
What's the harm?

05:08.597 --> 05:10.940
Behold!
The magic of flight!

05:11.027 --> 05:13.354
Yes! And now, next trick...
for my

05:13.441 --> 05:15.327
- next trick...
- No! No more tricks!

05:15.414 --> 05:16.886
Uh...

05:16.973 --> 05:17.967
no more tricks,

05:18.054 --> 05:20.167
because these tricks
blew my mind.

05:21.301 --> 05:23.688
We need some time to
process all the spectacle

05:23.775 --> 05:24.815
and wonderment.

05:24.902 --> 05:27.133
Yes! Yes,
in fact, Rapunzel,

05:27.220 --> 05:29.237
would you care to join
us in processing?

05:29.324 --> 05:30.820
Outside?

05:30.907 --> 05:32.129
Now!

05:36.223 --> 05:38.659
Make her give us the scroll,
and let's get out of here.

05:38.746 --> 05:41.117
She's the most annoying
person I've ever met,

05:41.204 --> 05:43.194
and look who I am
friends with!

05:43.281 --> 05:45.984
- Wait, we're friends?
- Cassandra, relax.

05:46.071 --> 05:48.524
Now, I know Calliope
is insanely irritating,

05:48.611 --> 05:50.644
but we're talking
about Rapunzel here.

05:50.731 --> 05:53.241
She doesn't even know how
to get annoyed with people.

05:53.328 --> 05:54.407
I mean, look at that...

05:54.494 --> 05:56.231
Oh, no, she's annoying you,
isn't she?

05:57.191 --> 05:58.465
No!

05:59.731 --> 06:01.944
No, she's not annoying,

06:02.031 --> 06:03.644
she's just different.

06:03.731 --> 06:05.814
Besides, doesn't matter
what I think,

06:05.901 --> 06:07.277
she's gonna give us
the scroll soon

06:07.364 --> 06:09.407
and we will be
on our way.

06:09.494 --> 06:11.944
Okay! We're all set!

06:12.031 --> 06:13.487
I can get you
that third piece.

06:13.574 --> 06:16.191
Great! So, where's the...

06:16.278 --> 06:17.862
Well, bon soir!

06:17.949 --> 06:18.944
Wait, what?

06:19.031 --> 06:20.064
It's French.

06:20.151 --> 06:22.144
It means, "I'm off to bed."

06:22.231 --> 06:25.644
But I thought we were gonna
get the scroll from the vault.

06:25.731 --> 06:27.500
Oh, no, silly girl!

06:27.587 --> 06:29.487
It's all the way on top
of a mountain,

06:29.574 --> 06:31.573
in a vault called
"The Spire."

06:31.660 --> 06:34.198
- But then, we'll... 
- It's a full day climb.

06:34.285 --> 06:35.904
I'll need a
good night's rest

06:35.991 --> 06:37.197
before I take that on.

06:37.284 --> 06:38.814
Hence, bon soir!

06:38.901 --> 06:41.731
No, we relaly
weren't expecting to...

06:42.746 --> 06:44.856
Hmm, okay!

06:45.033 --> 06:48.370
So I guess we'll just
camp out here!

06:48.457 --> 06:50.944
Without a caravan
or a tent.

06:51.031 --> 06:52.577
Still don't think
she's annoying?

06:56.129 --> 06:57.554
How 'bout now?

06:58.753 --> 07:00.213
Come on, come on,
come on, come on!

07:00.300 --> 07:03.295
Like this!  Left, right, left, right!
Left, right!

07:03.382 --> 07:05.178
If we're gonna get to
the top of that Spire,

07:05.265 --> 07:07.163
we have to pick up the pace!

07:07.277 --> 07:08.487
Let's go!

07:08.574 --> 07:10.315
We're burning
daylight, people!

07:11.363 --> 07:13.830
You guys go ahead. I'm...
I'm gonna stay here for a while.

07:13.917 --> 07:15.098
Come on, guys!

07:15.185 --> 07:16.404
It's a new day!

07:16.491 --> 07:18.451
Let's give Calliope a chance.

07:18.611 --> 07:20.407
Let's go, maggots!

07:27.338 --> 07:29.295
Listen, Blondie, why don't you
hang in the back of the group?

07:29.382 --> 07:31.483
Let Cass and me
be your irritation buffer.

07:31.570 --> 07:33.491
We've got more experience
being annoyed with people.

07:33.578 --> 07:35.748
I have experience
being annoyed with you.

07:36.637 --> 07:37.764
For the last time,

07:37.851 --> 07:39.407
I'm not annoyed with her!

07:39.494 --> 07:41.615
I'm just getting
to know her.

07:41.796 --> 07:45.194
'Cause I'm sure
behind her eccentric,

07:45.281 --> 07:46.486
somewhat pretentious,

07:46.573 --> 07:48.541
clearly inconsiderate
know-it-all,

07:48.628 --> 07:51.142
and thinks she's so much better
than everybody else exterior,

07:51.229 --> 07:54.115
there has to be some shred
of human decency, right?

07:54.261 --> 07:56.994
But I am not
annoyed with her.

07:57.081 --> 07:59.213
Hold up, hold up.
Hold up, princess.

07:59.300 --> 08:01.939
I think I got something
that just might help.

08:02.026 --> 08:03.077
This is Socky.

08:03.164 --> 08:04.275
My stress reliever.

08:04.362 --> 08:05.853
Whenever I feel pressure,

08:05.940 --> 08:07.393
I just squeeze old Socky,

08:07.480 --> 08:10.011
and woop!
Cool as a cucumber.

08:10.098 --> 08:11.428
Does it really work?

08:11.515 --> 08:14.195
It's why you see this
free and easy spirit

08:14.282 --> 08:15.524
standing before you today.

08:15.611 --> 08:16.681
Well, thank you, Lance,

08:16.768 --> 08:18.944
but, uh, I don't think
I'm gonna need this.

08:19.031 --> 08:21.401
Where's my hustle, people?

08:22.691 --> 08:24.451
I think you might need it.

08:28.031 --> 08:29.907
You'll notice this path of...

08:29.994 --> 08:31.111
Keep up, people!

08:31.198 --> 08:33.947
Of indigneous rocks
was created by the...

08:35.000 --> 08:41.073
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

08:42.964 --> 08:45.234
Here. You're doing it wrong.

08:45.344 --> 08:46.875
Oh, my sword!

08:49.424 --> 08:51.662
Rapunzel's palm sweat
made it slippery.

08:51.749 --> 08:54.209
Nice job, Rapunzel.

09:00.049 --> 09:01.314
Whoa!

09:01.401 --> 09:04.444
Hey, watch it up there,
you ding dongs!

09:04.531 --> 09:07.242
Please tell me we're near
the top of the spire.

09:07.329 --> 09:09.399
Spy-err.

09:16.979 --> 09:18.197
Wait! Wait, wait, wait!

09:18.284 --> 09:19.861
That looks like Poison Elm.

09:19.948 --> 09:21.537
We should
probably go around.

09:21.624 --> 09:24.984
I'm sure if there was
Poison Elm on this spire,

09:25.071 --> 09:26.102
I'd know.

09:26.720 --> 09:28.144
Itchy! Why?!

09:28.231 --> 09:29.490
Why? Why!

09:29.577 --> 09:30.716
And there it is.

09:30.803 --> 09:33.067
Now, can we
just go around?

09:33.154 --> 09:34.794
Like I suggested

09:34.881 --> 09:37.333
before "Palm Sweat"
got involved?

09:39.901 --> 09:41.530
Socky! No!

09:41.617 --> 09:43.031
Sorry.

09:44.731 --> 09:45.867
Oh, come on!

09:45.954 --> 09:48.808
There had to be a
safer way up this thing!

09:56.321 --> 09:57.901
I don't know what that was,

09:57.988 --> 09:59.345
but I don't
wanna run into it.

09:59.432 --> 10:01.122
Almost there!

10:01.209 --> 10:02.350
Um...

10:02.437 --> 10:03.812
Calliope?

10:03.945 --> 10:05.392
Is something wrong?

10:05.479 --> 10:06.757
No! No!

10:06.844 --> 10:08.144
I just, um...

10:08.231 --> 10:09.367
went the wrong way.

10:09.454 --> 10:11.407
What? What? I...
I can't hear you.

10:11.494 --> 10:13.569
I said this is
the wrong way.

10:13.656 --> 10:16.796
You took us the wrong way?

10:16.883 --> 10:18.116
No! No!

10:18.203 --> 10:19.283
It wasn't my fault!

10:19.370 --> 10:21.861
There were...

10:21.948 --> 10:24.245
What is that?

10:26.922 --> 10:28.480
It's real!

10:28.587 --> 10:31.190
The Protector
of the Spire!

10:33.231 --> 10:34.475
The Kirlok.

10:34.562 --> 10:37.616
Uh, Calliope?
What do we do?

10:38.437 --> 10:40.124
Kirlok...

10:42.500 --> 10:44.524
I'm gonna go with run!

10:44.611 --> 10:45.781
Calliope, come on!

10:52.651 --> 10:54.354
Go away!

10:54.441 --> 10:56.020
I don't think
he's listening!

10:56.143 --> 10:57.553
This way!

11:03.441 --> 11:04.774
That was a close one!

11:04.861 --> 11:06.196
Huh, guys?

11:06.624 --> 11:08.327
What the heck
was that thing?

11:08.414 --> 11:10.716
The Kirlok.

11:10.803 --> 11:13.572
You have to pay attention.

11:15.149 --> 11:17.368
Ahem! Well, then.

11:17.446 --> 11:20.404
The Keeper of the Spire
needs to, uh...

11:20.491 --> 11:22.197
recollect her thoughts,

11:22.284 --> 11:25.077
and strategize
our next move.

11:25.164 --> 11:26.272
Ow.

11:29.821 --> 11:31.277
We have to get rid of her.

11:31.364 --> 11:33.197
She has no idea
what she's doing.

11:33.284 --> 11:34.604
Cass, we can't.

11:34.691 --> 11:37.399
We need her to get
into the vault!

11:37.486 --> 11:39.118
Your call, sunshine.

11:39.302 --> 11:40.827
Oh, yeah! That's the spot!

11:40.914 --> 11:42.443
Whoo! Sweet relief!

11:43.651 --> 11:45.111
Huh?

11:49.949 --> 11:52.823
Calliope has gotten us
this far.

11:52.910 --> 11:55.268
Shorty could've
gotten us this far.

12:01.445 --> 12:03.560
Lance! You've done it again!

12:03.647 --> 12:05.714
Good job, buddy!

12:06.491 --> 12:08.577
Well, you know.
I just put my back into it,

12:08.664 --> 12:10.456
and it just
magically appeared.

12:10.543 --> 12:12.274
Oh-ho! Great!

12:12.361 --> 12:14.850
Looks like I found
a way out of here.

12:19.918 --> 12:21.077
Wait a minute.

12:21.164 --> 12:22.128
We made it!

12:22.215 --> 12:24.367
This is the top
of the spire!

12:24.454 --> 12:25.484
It is?!

12:25.571 --> 12:27.367
I mean, of course it is.

12:27.454 --> 12:29.524
And I got us here.

12:29.611 --> 12:32.514
Yeah. You sure did.

12:38.196 --> 12:40.194
Let me just find that key,

12:40.281 --> 12:42.241
and we'll get that scroll.

12:46.089 --> 12:48.117
It's never the
first one you try!

12:48.970 --> 12:49.963
Or second...

12:50.268 --> 12:51.354
or third...

12:51.441 --> 12:53.697
Oh, these must've
gotten rearranged

12:53.784 --> 12:56.253
when I was
fending off Kirlok.

12:56.775 --> 12:59.589
Uh, speaking of the Kirlok...

13:00.087 --> 13:02.659
I don't like
the looks of that!

13:02.746 --> 13:04.347
Oh, that's bad.

13:06.731 --> 13:09.953
Uh, guys? I think
this is its home.

13:10.250 --> 13:11.867
Uh, you think?

13:13.111 --> 13:14.314
Uh, Calliope!

13:14.401 --> 13:15.907
Now would be a great time

13:15.994 --> 13:17.644
to get that door open!

13:17.731 --> 13:19.537
I'm trying! Oh, come on!

13:19.624 --> 13:21.561
Come on, key.
I'm trying!

13:26.187 --> 13:28.756
Socky! I need you!

13:30.901 --> 13:32.984
Open the door! Now!

13:33.071 --> 13:35.111
I don't know
which is the right key!

13:35.198 --> 13:36.311
Watch out!

13:40.571 --> 13:42.354
What do you mean?!

13:42.441 --> 13:44.444
You're the
Keeper of the Spire!

13:44.531 --> 13:46.487
How could you not know
which is the right key?!

13:46.574 --> 13:47.884
Because I...

13:47.971 --> 13:51.255
I'm not the real
Keeper of the Spire.

13:53.406 --> 13:56.251
Are you kidding me?!

13:56.338 --> 13:58.220
What do you mean
you're not the Keeper?

14:00.408 --> 14:02.440
Uh, Rapunzel,
you might want to...

14:02.527 --> 14:05.177
- Stay out of this, Eugene!
- Guys, watch out!

14:07.191 --> 14:09.737
You know, for a
2,000 pound flesh eater

14:09.824 --> 14:11.157
he is quite nimble!

14:11.244 --> 14:12.855
Guys! The trees.

14:28.345 --> 14:30.090
We made it!

14:31.767 --> 14:33.274
Oh, right.

14:33.361 --> 14:34.680
Uh, I lied to you.

14:37.595 --> 14:39.530
Now, I can explain.

14:39.617 --> 14:40.658
Yeah, I'm sure you can...

14:41.784 --> 14:43.564
in 12 languages, no doubt.

14:43.651 --> 14:45.197
Listen, I don't know
who you are,

14:45.284 --> 14:47.150
but I trusted you!

14:47.237 --> 14:49.484
And I had to endure
your condescension,

14:49.571 --> 14:51.416
and... and your insults,

14:51.503 --> 14:53.877
and I went against
my better judgement,

14:53.964 --> 14:55.157
all because you said

14:55.244 --> 14:58.248
that you were the
Keeper of the Spire!

14:58.487 --> 14:59.694
It's Spy-err.

15:01.464 --> 15:02.517
Sorry.

15:02.635 --> 15:04.998
Who are you?

15:05.172 --> 15:07.161
I'm the Keeper's assistant.

15:07.248 --> 15:09.774
Or at least, I used to be.

15:09.861 --> 15:13.810
Before that, I was just
an incredibly talented

15:13.897 --> 15:15.975
street magician.

15:17.878 --> 15:19.651
I would perform my tricks

15:19.738 --> 15:21.850
in front of hundreds
of people.

15:21.972 --> 15:24.291
Not really.

15:24.378 --> 15:27.482
It wasn't always appreciated.

15:27.573 --> 15:30.314
Then one day,
the Keeper,

15:30.401 --> 15:33.234
the real Keeper
came up to me,

15:33.321 --> 15:34.741
out of the blue,

15:34.828 --> 15:37.764
and asked me
to be his apprentice.

15:37.851 --> 15:39.135
I had purpose,

15:39.222 --> 15:41.694
and I didn't want
to mess it up.

15:41.781 --> 15:45.737
I wanted to learn everything
I could about the Spire.

15:45.824 --> 15:46.947
I had to.

15:47.034 --> 15:48.277
It was going well,

15:48.364 --> 15:51.275
or at least,
I thought it was.

15:52.129 --> 15:54.611
But a few months ago,

15:54.698 --> 15:57.846
the Keeper
just disappeared.

15:57.941 --> 16:01.283
And once again,
I had no purpose.

16:01.390 --> 16:04.644
That is, until
you came along.

16:04.731 --> 16:06.395
Hello?

16:07.921 --> 16:09.288
Seeing you,

16:09.375 --> 16:11.777
someone with such
a clear purpose,

16:11.864 --> 16:13.412
inspired me.

16:13.499 --> 16:15.537
Maybe I could be the Keeper.

16:15.624 --> 16:18.150
Maybe I could
help you get that scroll.

16:18.237 --> 16:21.528
Why didn't you just tell us
you weren't the Keeper?

16:21.615 --> 16:24.664
Would you have accepted
help from an apprentice?

16:24.751 --> 16:26.868
Especially if you knew
she was abandoned

16:26.955 --> 16:28.830
by her own master?

16:29.071 --> 16:30.248
I don't know,

16:30.335 --> 16:34.088
but we probably wouldn't
be up this tree right now.

16:34.741 --> 16:36.971
That's actually
a really good point.

16:37.991 --> 16:39.680
Calliope...

16:39.767 --> 16:42.908
I still need
that scroll piece.

16:43.941 --> 16:47.230
And I still have one key
I haven't tried.

16:47.317 --> 16:48.314
Great!

16:48.401 --> 16:49.475
That's great news!

16:49.562 --> 16:51.398
Why don't you use it
to unlock the door

16:51.485 --> 16:52.994
before that thing
comes back?

16:58.870 --> 17:01.277
I specifically said "before
the thing comes back!"

17:01.364 --> 17:03.104
Gotta give it points
for persistence.

17:03.191 --> 17:04.277
I'll give it more points

17:04.364 --> 17:06.777
for letting us go
nice and easy.

17:09.594 --> 17:11.624
That's a lot of points
you just lost!

17:14.901 --> 17:17.037
We have to get it
away from the door.

17:17.124 --> 17:18.604
Ideas, anybody?

17:18.691 --> 17:20.144
Don't look at me.

17:20.231 --> 17:22.031
I'm just a failed magician.

17:22.117 --> 17:25.196
If it doesn't involve flash,
panache and sleight of hand,

17:25.284 --> 17:26.957
then I'm pretty much...

17:27.156 --> 17:29.624
Wait a second. Guys?

17:29.711 --> 17:32.285
I think I have an idea.

17:35.610 --> 17:39.061
Kirlok,
Protector of the Spire!

17:39.148 --> 17:41.904
It is I, Calliope!

17:41.991 --> 17:46.037
Uh, Apprentice
of the Keeper of the Spire,

17:46.124 --> 17:49.725
and legerdemain
artiste extraordinare.

17:52.184 --> 17:55.022
And do you know
what time it is?

17:56.691 --> 17:58.941
Time for wonder!

18:09.821 --> 18:11.987
Ha ha!

18:12.074 --> 18:13.231
Yoo hoo!

18:14.731 --> 18:16.144
Et voila!

18:16.231 --> 18:18.991
That's French for
"There it is!"

18:21.941 --> 18:22.991
Ahh...

18:24.531 --> 18:25.570
Boop.

18:31.651 --> 18:33.564
Come on!
Almost there!

18:35.861 --> 18:37.021
Now!

18:45.571 --> 18:47.104
Try not to scratch!

18:47.191 --> 18:48.433
You'll regret it.

18:48.520 --> 18:51.314
Nice job facing
the Kirlok, Calliope.

18:51.401 --> 18:53.734
And those tricks
weren't so bad either.

18:53.821 --> 18:55.938
Oh, there's more
where that came from.

18:56.025 --> 18:57.944
Just an ordinary coin, right?

18:58.031 --> 19:00.421
Yeah, hmm, maybe later.

19:35.966 --> 19:37.969
The third scroll piece,

19:38.056 --> 19:39.845
and you got us here.

19:39.932 --> 19:40.981
You did it!

19:41.068 --> 19:43.821
And I couldn't
be more proud.

19:48.158 --> 19:49.474
Keeper!

19:53.784 --> 19:57.629
Calliope, you are now
the Keeper of the Spire.

19:57.716 --> 19:59.451
You passed my test.

19:59.538 --> 20:01.430
Congratulations!

20:03.399 --> 20:05.024
Wha... what?

20:05.111 --> 20:06.524
I don't understand.

20:06.611 --> 20:08.484
I'm sorry for leaving you,

20:08.571 --> 20:09.864
but I had to remind you

20:09.951 --> 20:12.586
why I chose you
in the first place.

20:12.955 --> 20:14.710
Why did you choose me?

20:14.797 --> 20:16.625
Your perseverence.

20:17.052 --> 20:19.876
This is the skill a Keeper
of such great artifacts

20:19.963 --> 20:22.606
must call upon
in the face of adversity.

20:22.693 --> 20:23.694
And you did it!

20:23.781 --> 20:25.262
Not only with the Kirlok,

20:25.349 --> 20:28.071
but when you
performed in front of a...

20:28.168 --> 20:30.625
aggressively
indifferent crowd.

20:30.712 --> 20:32.998
Mmm, their minds
were too blown to clap.

20:33.085 --> 20:34.069
That's all.

20:34.156 --> 20:35.938
You persevered, Calliope.

20:36.027 --> 20:38.675
Wait. There had
to be an easier way

20:38.762 --> 20:39.856
to teach her that lesson.

20:39.943 --> 20:41.737
That beast thing
almost killed us.

20:41.824 --> 20:42.989
The Kirlok?

20:43.076 --> 20:45.102
He's actually a loyal pet.

20:45.189 --> 20:48.571
As you will see,
when you train your own.

20:51.310 --> 20:53.037
Aw!

20:54.280 --> 20:56.697
Do keep him away
from the furniture.

20:56.983 --> 20:58.827
Thank you, Rapunzel.

20:58.914 --> 21:01.314
Thank you for everything.

21:01.401 --> 21:05.064
I'm glad you found
what you were looking for.

21:05.151 --> 21:07.445
Too bad you
couldn't find my sword.

21:07.532 --> 21:09.797
Oh, didn't I?

21:12.252 --> 21:13.526
Made you look!

21:13.861 --> 21:15.856
Oh, you should
see the expression

21:15.943 --> 21:17.024
on your face right now!

21:17.111 --> 21:18.657
And when she's
making that expression,

21:18.744 --> 21:19.944
it means we should go.

21:20.031 --> 21:21.327
Oh, okay, then!

21:21.414 --> 21:24.664
Goodbye, and good luck
with the scroll!

21:35.191 --> 21:38.110
We went through
a lot of trouble for this.

21:39.401 --> 21:41.820
It better be
one amazing scroll.

21:41.907 --> 21:43.594
That's all I gotta say.

21:43.682 --> 21:45.774
Let's see what we got.

21:45.861 --> 21:47.524
A guy in a hood?

21:47.611 --> 21:49.750
All of this for
a guy in a hood?!

21:49.896 --> 21:51.224
Who do you think he is?

21:51.311 --> 21:52.604
I'm not sure.

21:52.691 --> 21:56.227
But I have a feeling
we're going to find out.
