WEBVTT

00:05.216 --> 00:07.467
Joe: HAPPY BIRTHDAY, MEL.

00:07.468 --> 00:12.092
WOW, SOMETHING SMELLS GOOD. I
THINK I'M HAVING A NOSE-GASM.

00:12.093 --> 00:15.726
OH... OH... ACHOO!

00:19.810 --> 00:24.104
OKAY, IS THE BIRTHDAY GIRL READY
TO START HER SPECIAL DAY?

00:24.105 --> 00:25.565
YES, SHE IS!

00:25.566 --> 00:28.448
OKAY, HERE WE GO, HERE WE GO.

00:28.449 --> 00:30.820
AND HAPPY BIRTHDAY.

00:30.821 --> 00:32.533
CAKE FOR BREAKFAST!
CAKE FOR BREAKFAST!

00:34.415 --> 00:35.705
DID YOU MAKE A WISH?

00:35.706 --> 00:37.617
YES, BUT IT ALREADY CAME TRUE...
CAKE FOR BREAKFAST!

00:37.618 --> 00:39.619
IT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT
MEAL OF THE DAY, HONEY.

00:39.620 --> 00:41.791
YOU HAVE ALL YOUR FOOD
GROUPS COVERED RIGHT THERE.

00:41.792 --> 00:44.124
IT'S GOT, YOU KNOW,
YOUR FROSTING GROUP.

00:44.125 --> 00:45.545
IT HAS THE WHITE FLOUR GROUP.

00:45.546 --> 00:47.297
AND. OF COURSE, THE MOST
IMPORTANT OF ALL...

00:47.298 --> 00:48.759
THE CANDLE GROUP.

00:49.800 --> 00:52.173
- IS IT WRONG TO SUCK THE
FROSTING OFF? -YES.

00:53.764 --> 00:55.175
EH, TOO BAD.

00:55.176 --> 00:56.846
IT'S MY BIRTHDAY, I CAN
DO WHATEVER I WANT.

00:56.847 --> 00:59.559
AW, I HAVE THE MOST WONDERFUL
HUSBAND IN THE WHOLE WORLD.

00:59.560 --> 01:02.482
HE BAKES ME A FANCY CAKE, HE...
WAIT, WHERE'S MY PRESENT?

01:02.483 --> 01:04.774
DO YOU WANT IT NOW? OR DO YOU
WANT TO SAVE IT FOR LATER?

01:04.775 --> 01:06.107
PRESENT NOW! PRESENT NOW!

01:07.148 --> 01:08.149
OKAY, ALRIGHT, HOLD ON.

01:10.241 --> 01:11.321
- HERE IT IS.
- OOH!

01:11.322 --> 01:12.323
Joe: OOH!

01:14.325 --> 01:18.328
OH! IT'S ONE OF THESE... THINGS.

01:18.329 --> 01:19.829
WHAT IS THIS?

01:19.830 --> 01:22.622
- WELL, HONEY, THAT IS A... -OH,
NO, NO, WAIT! DON'T TELL ME.

01:22.623 --> 01:24.043
IS IT A WAITRESS TASER?

01:24.044 --> 01:25.545
YOU KNOW, THEY'RE ABOUT
TO TAKE YOUR FOOD AWAY

01:25.546 --> 01:28.548
AND YOU'RE LIKE, "WAIT, I'M NOTE
DONE WITH THAT YET!" (taser sound)

01:28.549 --> 01:31.551
- NO, NO IT'S NOT... -OH, IS IT ONE
OF THOSE NEW SWEDISH CORKSCREWS?

01:31.552 --> 01:33.513
I SAW IT ON GOOD
MORNING AMERICA.

01:33.514 --> 01:35.425
YOU KNOW, IT'S
CALLED THE GRRGLE.

01:35.426 --> 01:37.307
YEAH, LET'S TEST IT OUT.

01:37.308 --> 01:40.350
BECAUSE THE ONLY THING BETTER THAN CAKE
FOR BREAKFAST IS WINE FOR BREAKFAST!

01:40.351 --> 01:42.522
HONEY, HONEY, COME HERE LOOK,
I'M JUST GONNA TELL YOU.

01:42.523 --> 01:46.356
OKAY, THAT RIGHT THERE,
IS A LIFEHAMMER.

01:46.357 --> 01:48.568
A LIFE WHO?

01:48.569 --> 01:50.360
IT'S A LIFEHAMMER.

01:50.361 --> 01:51.571
YOU KEEP THAT IN
YOUR CAR, ALRIGHT?

01:51.572 --> 01:53.733
AND IF THERE'S AN EMERGENCY,
LIKE SAY, YOU KNOW, YOUR CAR

01:53.734 --> 01:57.737
PLUNGES OFF THE ROAD INTO A LAKE BECAUSE YOU
WERE PUTTING ON MAKEUP INSTEAD OF DRIVING

01:57.738 --> 02:00.870
WITH THIS LITTLE THING RIGHT
HERE YOU CAN CUT THE SEATBELT

02:00.871 --> 02:03.082
AND THEN YOU CAN SMACK
OPEN THE WINDOW WITH THAT

02:03.083 --> 02:05.335
AND YOU CAN ESCAPE.
IT'S COOL, HUH?

02:05.336 --> 02:07.667
AW, I LOVE IT!

02:07.668 --> 02:10.171
NOW GIVE ME MY REAL GIFT SO I CAN
US MY LIFEHAMMER TO CUT THE RIBBON.

02:12.092 --> 02:14.464
NO, THAT IS THE REAL PRESENT.

02:14.465 --> 02:18.097
LOOK, HONEY, I LOVE YOU.
YOU KNOW?

02:18.098 --> 02:22.102
AND IF YOU WERE EVER IN A HORRIBLE,
HORRIBLE ACCIDENT, I'D WANT YOU TO SURVIVE.

02:25.145 --> 02:29.729
YOU KNOW, NO ONE HAS EVER CARED ENOUGH
ABOUT ME TO BUY ME A LIFEHAMMER.

02:29.730 --> 02:31.482
THAT WAS REALLY THOUGHTFUL, JOE.

02:33.324 --> 02:35.905
IT IS. SO THOUGHTFUL. THANK YOU.

02:35.906 --> 02:38.078
I CAN'T WAIT TO BE
TRAPPED UNDER WATER.

I GOT ONE, TOO.

03:07.308 --> 03:10.480
- YOU DO? -YEAH, I DO. WELL, I
HAVE THE EXECUTIVE LIFEHAMMER.

03:10.481 --> 03:13.443
IT'S LEATHER, WITH BRASS ACCENTS
AND A LASER POINTER ON IT.

03:13.444 --> 03:16.736
SO NOW, YOU AND I, WE ARE THE
SAFEST COUPLE THAT I KNOW.

03:16.737 --> 03:20.910
- YEAH. -YEP. YOU KNOW, SAFETY IS
WHAT EVERY NEW BRIDE DREAMS OF.

03:20.911 --> 03:24.705
BECAUSE BETTER THAN DIAMONDS...
IS SAFETY.

03:26.457 --> 03:28.207
YOU BET IT IS!

03:28.208 --> 03:30.381
NOW IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME I HAVE TO GO
GET SWEATY WITH A GUY IN A GARAGE.

03:32.383 --> 03:35.425
THAT SOUNDED REALLY WEIRD. I
HAVE TO GO TRAIN A CLIENT.

03:35.426 --> 03:36.797
- SEE YA.
- SEE YOU.

03:39.800 --> 03:42.051
AW, WHAT'S THE MATTER?

03:42.052 --> 03:44.103
I DON'T MEAN TO SOUND
UNGRATEFUL, BUT

03:44.104 --> 03:46.225
THIS IS THE WORST GIFT
I'VE EVER GOTTEN.

03:46.226 --> 03:48.608
I MEAN, WE'RE BARELY MARRIED
AND THIS IS HOW JOE SEES ME?

03:48.609 --> 03:53.313
NOT AS HIS HOT SEXY WIFE, BUT AS SOMEONE
THE POLICE DIVER IS LOOKING FOR.

03:53.314 --> 03:56.696
I WOULDN'T GET TOO UPSET ABOUT IT.
THERE MIGHT BE SOMETHING ELSE LATER.

03:56.697 --> 03:58.358
OH WHAT? A TOOL BELT?

03:58.359 --> 04:00.360
A FIRE EXTINGUISHER?

04:00.361 --> 04:03.533
A CARBON MONOXIDE DETECTOR? OH NO, WAIT,
THAT'S THE FIFTH ANNIVERSARY GIFT.

04:03.534 --> 04:06.667
ALL I'M SAYING IS, THIS IS JUST
THE BEGINNING OF YOUR BIRTHDAY.

04:08.038 --> 04:09.709
HOLD ON, MISSY. WHAT
DOES THAT MEAN?

04:09.710 --> 04:11.581
WHAT? NOTHING.

04:11.582 --> 04:15.505
ALL I'M SAYING IS THAT YOUR BIRTHDAY
GOES ALL DAY. AND IN TO THE NIGHT.

04:15.506 --> 04:18.428
OOH... YOU KNOW SOMETHING.

04:18.429 --> 04:21.140
- I'VE GOT TO GET TO CLASS.
- NO, NO, NO, HOLD ON!

04:21.141 --> 04:23.843
SIT DOWN, YOU'RE NOT
GOING ANYWHERE, SISTER!

04:23.844 --> 04:26.145
SISTER? MISSY? YOU KNOW
I DON'T LIKE NICKNAMES.

04:26.146 --> 04:28.097
WHAT IS MY REAL
GIFT, LENNY-PENNY?

04:28.098 --> 04:30.560
AND DON'T BOTHER LYING
BECAUSE YOU HAVE A "TELL."

04:30.561 --> 04:33.523
- WHAT'S A "TELL"? -EVERY TIME
YOU LIE, YOUR NOSE TWITCHES.

04:33.524 --> 04:35.355
- NO, IT DOESN'T.
- YES, IT DOES.

04:35.356 --> 04:38.197
ALRIGHT, SO, SPILL IT!
WHAT'S MY REAL GIFT?

04:38.198 --> 04:40.610
UH... (sighs)

04:40.611 --> 04:43.032
I PROMISED SOMEBODY I WOULDN'T
SAY ANYTHING ABOUT ANYTHING.

04:43.033 --> 04:46.616
WELL, TELL THAT TO YOUR TWITCHING NOSE.
SPILL IT! WHAT DO YOU KNOW?

04:46.617 --> 04:48.458
NOTHING, NOTHING.

04:48.459 --> 04:51.581
THEN WHY ARE YOU COVERING YOUR
NOSE AND AVOIDING EYE CONTACT?

04:51.582 --> 04:53.373
I AM NOT.

04:53.374 --> 04:57.797
I'M LOOKING RIGHT IN THE CORNER OF YOUR EYE,
WHERE YOU STILL HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF SLEEP.

04:57.798 --> 04:59.759
NO, THAT'S FROSTING.

04:59.760 --> 05:01.881
COME ON, IS IT A PLANE TICKET?

05:01.882 --> 05:04.344
WILL I NEED TO PACK A
BIKINI OR A PARKA?

05:04.345 --> 05:05.725
SWIM FINS OR STILETTOS?

05:05.726 --> 05:07.387
OH, THIS IS EXCITING. IT'S
LIKE A LITTLE GAME SHOW!

05:07.388 --> 05:09.849
OKAY, CALM DOWN. LOOK, I CANT
TELL YOU WHAT YOUR GIFT IS

05:09.850 --> 05:11.522
BECAUSE IT WOULD TOTALLY
BETRAY JOE'S TRUST.

05:13.063 --> 05:15.355
- BUT... -OH, GOOD,
THERE'S A "BUT." GO ON!

05:15.356 --> 05:18.648
OKAY. IF YOU GUESS, I WILL NOD.

05:18.649 --> 05:21.320
THAT WAY I CAN SAY TRUTHFULLY
THAT I DIDN'T TELL YOU.

05:21.321 --> 05:26.245
OKAY, LET'S SEE... IT'S PROBABLY
SOMETHING I'VE HINTED THAT I WANT.

05:26.246 --> 05:29.409
- WHICH IS ANYTHING SHINY.
- I LOOK GOOD IN SHINY.

05:29.410 --> 05:31.541
OOH, OOH!

05:31.542 --> 05:34.544
IS IT THE HARRY WINSTON BRACELET THAT
ANGELINA JOLIE WORE LAST YEAR TO THE OSCARS?

05:34.545 --> 05:37.667
TRY TO KEEP YOUR GUESSES IN THE
UNDER-ONE-MILLION-DOLLAR RANGE.

05:37.668 --> 05:40.630
HEY, I CAN'T HELP IT IF
I HAVE EXPENSIVE TASTE.

05:40.631 --> 05:44.093
OOH, IS IT THE BIRKIN BAG I SAW ON GWYNETH
PALTROW THAT WOULD LOOK SO MUCH BETTER ON ME

05:44.094 --> 05:46.516
BECAUSE SHE IS JUST TOO SKINNY
AND IT MAKES HER HEAD LOOK HUGE?

05:46.517 --> 05:50.470
OKAY, I DON'T HAVE ALL DAY. WOULD YOU PLEASE
JUST GUESS A CUSTOM-MADE WEDDING RING?

05:50.471 --> 05:54.604
- SHUT UP! IS IT A CUSTOM-MADE WEDDING RING?
- HOW'D YOU GUESS?

05:54.605 --> 05:57.356
- WHERE DID HE HIDE IT?
- WHOA, STOP THAT!

05:57.357 --> 05:59.739
YOU CAN'T SAY ANYTHING TO JOE. YOU
DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THIS.

05:59.740 --> 06:02.402
OH, OF COURSE. I'LL ACT SURPRISED.
I'M GOOD AT THIS. WATCH.

06:02.403 --> 06:07.488
(gasps) JOE, I LOVE IT!

06:08.449 --> 06:09.870
SEE, I EVEN SQUEEZED
OUT A LITTLE TEAR.

06:11.792 --> 06:14.204
- NO, THAT'S FROSTING.
- OH! EVEN BETTER.

06:18.799 --> 06:22.381
- HEY! -HEY, IT'S THE BIRTHDAY GIRL.
HOW WAS WORK?

06:22.382 --> 06:25.385
WONDERFUL. I WAS SHOWERED IN
BIRTHDAY LOVE AND... CAKE FOR LUNCH!

06:26.887 --> 06:30.099
NO, YOU KNOW, I WAS THINKING. RATHER THAN
ME COOKING AN AMAZING MEAL FOR YOU TONIGHT

06:30.100 --> 06:32.472
WHY DON'T WE DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT?
I'LL TAKE YOU OUT FOR YOUR BIRTHDAY.

06:32.473 --> 06:34.564
I THOUGHT WE COULD TRY
THAT NEW THAI PLACE.

06:34.565 --> 06:36.566
I LOVE YOU. I LOVE YOU.
I LOVE YOU.

06:36.567 --> 06:39.899
YOU'RE THE MOST WONDERFUL MAN IN THE WHOLE
WORLD! AND I LOVE MY UNDERWATER HAMMER.

06:39.900 --> 06:42.572
I JUST LOVE
EVERYTHING ABOUT YOU.

06:42.573 --> 06:47.157
- YOU TOLD HER.
- I DID NOT. TECHNICALLY.

06:48.659 --> 06:50.740
LENNOX!

06:50.741 --> 06:54.794
SHE JUST GUESSED THAT SHE WAS GETTING A
RING, OKAY? SHE'S A REALLY GOOD GUESSER.

06:54.795 --> 06:56.996
SHE GUESSED THAT ALL ON HER OWN?
REALLY?

06:56.997 --> 06:59.999
I AM NOT TAKING
QUESTIONS AT THIS TIME.

07:00.000 --> 07:03.633
DON'T BE MAD AT LENNOX. SHE RESISTED
FOR CLOSE TO THIRTY SECONDS.

07:03.634 --> 07:07.426
WELL, I WAS GOING TO GIVE IT TO YOU TONIGHT,
BUT OKAY, FINE, I CAN GIVE IT TO YOU NOW.

07:07.427 --> 07:09.679
I MEAN, IT'S BEEN RIGHT
IN FRONT OF YOU ALL WEEK.

07:09.680 --> 07:10.970
OH, HOW DID I MISS IT?

07:10.971 --> 07:14.514
BECAUSE I HID IT BETWEEN
LEAVES OF KALE.

07:14.515 --> 07:16.766
THE LAST PLACE I WOULD EVER LOOK!
GENIUS!

07:16.767 --> 07:18.018
YOU KNOW, I HAVE MY MOMENTS.

07:19.109 --> 07:22.482
MMM... VELVETEEN. LIKE PETTING
A FANCY LITTLE PUPPY.

07:22.483 --> 07:24.944
YEAH. WELL, YOU KNOW, HONEY, I FELT
REALLY BAD WHEN WE GOT MARRIED

07:24.945 --> 07:27.617
AND YOU DIDN'T HAVE A
SUPER NICE WEDDING RING.

07:27.618 --> 07:29.448
THAT JUST DIDN'T SEEM RIGHT TO ME.
SO!

07:29.449 --> 07:31.572
I DESIGNED THIS AND
HAD IT MADE FOR YOU.

07:34.625 --> 07:36.996
JOE, IT'S...

07:36.997 --> 07:39.288
SO...

07:39.289 --> 07:41.340
- SO...
- I KNOW.

07:41.341 --> 07:43.252
I'VE BEEN WORKING WITH
A PROFESSIONAL JEWELER

07:43.253 --> 07:44.674
FOR THE LAST COUPLE OF
MONTHS ON THIS THING.

07:44.675 --> 07:47.847
SO THAT YOU WOULD HAVE A
RING LIKE NO ONE ELSE'S.

07:47.848 --> 07:50.350
WELL, I DEFINITELY
HAVE ONE OF THOSE NOW.

07:51.682 --> 07:52.932
YEAH, YOU SEE, HONEY...

07:52.933 --> 07:54.934
THE MOON, THERE, REPRESENTS YOU.

07:54.935 --> 07:56.766
RIGHT, YOU'RE MYSTERIOUS
AND SEDUCTIVE.

07:56.767 --> 07:59.599
THE SUN REPRESENTS ME,
BRILLIANT AND POWERFUL.

07:59.600 --> 08:03.564
AND THE TIDE, RIGHT HERE, REPRESENTS
THE NEVER-ENDING RHYTHM OF OUR LOVE.

08:04.735 --> 08:06.736
WOW. IT'S LIKE A
MEANING JAMBALAYA.

08:06.737 --> 08:09.198
IT IS. IT WAS A LOT OF PRESSURE
COMING UP WITH SOMETHING LIKE THIS.

08:09.199 --> 08:12.573
I MEAN, SOMETHING THAT YOU WERE GONNA
WEAR EVERY DAY FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE.

08:14.575 --> 08:18.748
OH, JOE, I LOVE IT.
I LOVE IT SO MUCH.

08:18.749 --> 08:21.831
OH, LENNOX, I HATE IT.
I HATE IT SO MUCH.

08:21.832 --> 08:24.124
I'D RATHER WEAR THE LIFEHAMMER.
WHAT DO I DO?

08:29.630 --> 08:32.633
I'M TRAPPED. NOW I HAVE TO WEAR
THIS HIDEOUS THING FOREVER.

08:33.764 --> 08:36.225
- COME ON, THE RING'S NOT SO BAD.
- REALLY?

08:36.226 --> 08:38.598
HAVE YOU SEEN IT UP CLOSE? YEAH,
WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THIS THING?

08:38.599 --> 08:41.852
IT'S GOLD, IT'S PLATINUM... AND WHAT IS THAT
METAL RIGHT THERE? IS THAT WROUGHT IRON?

08:43.143 --> 08:44.855
IT'S LIKE A LITTLE
JAIL FOR MY KNUCKLE.

08:46.486 --> 08:48.608
JOE DOESN'T KNOW ME AT ALL.

08:48.609 --> 08:51.491
I LOVE JOE, BUT I GOTTA SAY...
I HATE THIS RING.

08:52.613 --> 08:54.414
WELL, YOU HATED JOE AT FIRST.

08:55.535 --> 09:00.660
SO, REALLY, WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT, THAT
RING IS A GREAT SYMBOL FOR YOUR RELATIONSHIP.

09:00.661 --> 09:02.792
COME ON, JOE POURED HIS
HEART AND SOUL INTO THIS.

09:02.793 --> 09:05.925
YEAH, AND HIS LIVER AND HIS
PANCREAS AND THE KITCHEN SINK.

09:05.926 --> 09:08.047
WHAT DO I DO?

09:08.048 --> 09:10.720
I DON'T KNOW. IF YOU TELL HIM YOU DON'T LIKE
IT, IT'S REALLY GOING TO HURT HIS FEELINGS.

09:10.721 --> 09:13.803
- I KNOW... -I THOUGHT
YOU LIKED SURPRISES.

09:13.804 --> 09:14.934
YEAH. GOOD SURPRISES.

09:14.935 --> 09:17.136
YOU KNOW, LIKE FINDING MONEY
IN AN OLD PAIR OF PANTS.

09:17.137 --> 09:19.600
NOT RINGS THAT MAKE IT LOOK LIKE
I WON THE SUPER BOWL OF BLECH.

09:20.601 --> 09:24.734
COME ON, AUNT MEL, JUST
WEAR THE RING, FOR JOE.

09:24.735 --> 09:26.896
YEAH, I KNOW, YOU'RE RIGHT.

09:26.897 --> 09:28.818
I CAN DO IT.

09:28.819 --> 09:31.570
I CAN LIE. I CAN LIE EVERYDAY
FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE.

09:31.571 --> 09:33.573
THAT'S HOW MUCH I LOVE JOE.

09:35.656 --> 09:37.036
YEAH.

09:37.037 --> 09:41.661
YOU KNOW WHAT? IN THIS LIGHT
IT DOESN'T LOOK HALF BAD.

09:41.662 --> 09:47.046
IT'S UNIQUE. IT MAKES A STRONG STATEMENT,
IT HAS A BEAUTY ALL OF IT'S OWN.

09:47.047 --> 09:49.048
SEE, IT'S GROWING
ON YOU ALREADY.

09:49.049 --> 09:51.170
HA! FOOLED YOU!

09:51.171 --> 09:53.923
- IF THERE WAS AN OSCAR FOR BEST REAL LIFE
ACTING... -IT'S CALLED LYING, AUNT MEL.

09:53.924 --> 09:56.175
I'D LIKE TO THANK THE ACADEMY.

09:56.176 --> 09:57.597
BUT NOT REALLY.
BOOM, THAT'S TWO.

10:03.563 --> 10:06.395
ALL RIGHT I'M READY TO GO OUT
FOR MY HAPPY BIRTHDAY DINNER.

10:06.396 --> 10:08.027
HEY, HEY, I AM READY TOO.

10:08.028 --> 10:09.729
ALMOST, YOUR TIE IS CROOKED.

10:09.730 --> 10:11.030
OH.

10:11.031 --> 10:13.492
HEY, YOU'RE NOT
WEARING THE RING.

10:13.493 --> 10:16.285
WELL, YEAH, IT'S JUST SO NEW.

10:16.286 --> 10:19.739
AND SO... EXPRESSIVE.

10:19.740 --> 10:22.041
AND I WANTED TO SAVE IT
FOR A SPECIAL OCCASION.

10:22.042 --> 10:24.413
ISN'T YOUR BIRTHDAY
A SPECIAL OCCASION?

10:24.414 --> 10:28.168
YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT. I DON'T
KNOW WHAT I WAS THINKING.

10:29.710 --> 10:33.252
YEAH, THERE IT IS. LOOK AT THAT!
TWENTY-FOUR CARATS OF LOVE, BABY.

10:33.253 --> 10:36.055
YEAH, AND IF SOME GUY TRIES
TO MUG US IN THE PARKING LOT,

10:36.056 --> 10:38.257
ONE PUNCH WITH THIS DIAMOND STUDDED
BAD BOY AND HE'S OUT COLD.

10:38.258 --> 10:40.139
(laughs)

10:40.140 --> 10:42.141
I'M SO HAPPY YOU LIKE IT, HONEY. I MEAN,
I HAVE TO ADMIT, I'M PRETTY RELIEVED.

10:42.142 --> 10:44.643
I WAS NERVOUS, 'CAUSE I'VE
NEVER DESIGNED JEWELRY BEFORE.

10:44.644 --> 10:47.646
GET OUT! I NEVER
WOULD HAVE GUESSED.

10:47.647 --> 10:50.730
YEAH, WELL, I JUST REALLY WANTED
TO CREATE SOMETHING BEAUTIFUL

10:50.731 --> 10:53.693
THAT, YOU KNOW, WOULD
JUST MAKE YOU HAPPY.

10:53.694 --> 10:56.116
- WELL, YOU OUTDID YOURSELF, JOE.
- SO YOU REALLY LOVE IT, HUH?

10:57.828 --> 11:01.831
YES. YEAH, YOU KNOW, IT
MAKES A STRONG STATEMENT.

11:01.832 --> 11:03.953
AND IT HAS A BEAUTY
ALL OF IT'S OWN.

11:03.954 --> 11:07.207
AND IS UNLIKE ANYTHING I
HAVE EVER SEEN BEFORE.

11:09.129 --> 11:10.589
THAT'S SO SWEET.

11:10.590 --> 11:11.791
COME HERE.

11:11.792 --> 11:14.964
SO GO ON. WHAT'S
YOUR FAVORITE PART?

11:14.965 --> 11:18.137
MY FAVORITE PART? WELL, YOU KNOW, I
WOULDN'T WANT TO PICK A FAVORITE PART

11:18.138 --> 11:21.931
BECAUSE THAT JUST WOULDN'T BE FAIR
TO ALL OF THE OTHER AWESOME PARTS.

11:21.932 --> 11:24.303
THEY WOULD JUST FEEL
BAD ABOUT THEMSELVES.

11:24.304 --> 11:27.146
WELL, THAT'S OKAY. YOU CAN JUST
COMPLIMENT ALL OF THE PARTS.

11:27.147 --> 11:28.938
I CAN TAKE IT.

11:28.939 --> 11:32.652
WELL, OKAY, FIRST... I LIKE...

11:36.817 --> 11:38.447
WHAT WAS THAT FOR?

11:38.448 --> 11:41.620
WELL, YOU KNOW, I JUST WANTED TO
THANK YOU FOR THE RING AND...

11:41.621 --> 11:44.785
YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES,
THERE ARE NO WORDS.

11:49.750 --> 11:51.090
GUESS WHO DELIVERS?

11:51.091 --> 11:54.754
- I DO. -I WAS THINKING THE THAI
PLACE, I'M GONNA PUT IN THE ORDER.

11:54.755 --> 11:58.137
OKAY, WELL, YOU DO THE ORDERING OF THE TAKE
OUT, AND I WILL DO THE ORDERING IN HERE.

11:58.138 --> 12:01.181
HEY-O, THAT SOUNDS GOOD TO ME.
ALL RIGHT, HERE WE GO.

12:05.846 --> 12:07.396
YOU SURE YOU DON'T WANT
ANY OF MY PANCAKES?

12:07.397 --> 12:09.398
COME ONE, I'VE NEVER SEEN YOU
TURN DOWN MY PANCAKES BEFORE.

12:09.399 --> 12:12.021
OH, NO, I'M STILL A LITTLE QUEASY
FROM THE THAI FOOD LAST NIGHT.

12:12.022 --> 12:14.775
I PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE STOPPED EATING WHEN
I FOUND THE BAND-AID IN THE PAD THAI.

12:16.736 --> 12:18.487
OKAY, THROWING OUT ALL
OF THE LEFTOVERS.

12:18.488 --> 12:21.070
NO, WAIT, BUT EVERYTHING AROUND
THE BAND-AID WAS SO GOOD.

12:21.071 --> 12:23.742
OKAY, YEAH, YOU'RE PROBABLY RIGHT.
ANYWAY, I'LL SEE YOU TONIGHT, HONEY.

12:23.743 --> 12:25.744
HEY, HEY, HEY. ARE YOU
WEARING THE RING?

12:25.745 --> 12:29.498
OF COURSE! I'M GOING TO
MAKE MY COWORKERS JEALOUS!

12:29.499 --> 12:31.171
- I LOVE YOU.
- LOVE YOU.

12:38.969 --> 12:40.299
CRAP.

12:40.300 --> 12:41.341
(sighs)

12:42.302 --> 12:44.094
CRAP, CRAPPITY CRAP, CRAP.

12:47.517 --> 12:50.850
- OOH, DIBS ON THOSE PANCAKES. -GO
AHEAD, YOUR AUNT DIDN'T WANT THEM.

12:50.851 --> 12:53.062
SO, HOW DID EVERYTHING
GO LAST NIGHT?

12:53.063 --> 12:54.814
YOU, KNOW, ACTUALLY, IT
REALLY DIDN'T GO THAT GREAT.

12:54.815 --> 12:57.857
I MEAN, I THOUGHT I WAS GETTING SOMETHING
FOR MEL THAT SHE WAS REALLY GONNA LOVE,

12:57.858 --> 13:00.860
AND IT TURNED OUT I WAS WRONG
AND IT LITERALLY MADE HER SICK.

13:00.861 --> 13:02.491
- SHE SAID THAT?
- YEAH.

13:02.492 --> 13:04.703
AS A MATTER OF FACT, SHE SAID
THAT SHE FELT SO NAUSEOUS

13:04.704 --> 13:06.035
THAT SHE THOUGHT SHE
WAS GONNA THROW UP.

13:06.036 --> 13:07.907
BECAUSE OF THE RING?

13:07.908 --> 13:09.788
NO, BECAUSE OF THE
BAD THAI FOOD WE...

13:09.789 --> 13:11.251
WHY DID YOU JUST SAY THE RING?

13:12.792 --> 13:13.914
NO REASON.

13:15.125 --> 13:19.758
YOU KNOW WHAT, I'M ACTUALLY LATE FOR...
NOT BEING HERE.

13:19.759 --> 13:23.382
LENNOX, SHE DIDN'T... SHE
DIDN'T LIKE THE RING?

13:23.383 --> 13:26.055
UGH! PEOPLE SHOULD REALLY
STOP TELLING ME STUFF.

13:26.056 --> 13:28.928
IT'S NOT FAIR TO ANYONE.
ESPECIALLY ME.

13:28.929 --> 13:31.270
WHAT DID SHE SAY ABOUT
THE RING, LENNOX?

13:31.271 --> 13:33.313
NOTHING. NOTHING
YOU'D WANT TO HEAR.

13:35.525 --> 13:37.277
SHOW ME YOUR NOSE.

13:39.439 --> 13:41.941
WELL, SHE MIGHT HAVE SAID...

13:41.942 --> 13:44.865
"OH MY GOD, MY HUSBAND DOESN'T
KNOW ME, IT'S HORRIBLE."

13:46.286 --> 13:47.868
SHE SAID THAT I DON'T KNOW HER?

13:49.039 --> 13:50.619
SHE SAID IT WAS HORRIBLE?

13:50.620 --> 13:53.793
NO, NO, NO, SHE DIDN'T SAY HORRIBLE.
SHE SAID HIDEOUS.

13:57.457 --> 13:58.758
THANKS FOR TELLING ME.

14:01.051 --> 14:04.263
ON THE BRIGHT SIDE, AUNT MEL
PROMISED TO PRETEND TO LIKE IT.

14:04.264 --> 14:07.726
SHE'S WILLING TO LIE TO YOU
EVERYDAY, FOR THE REST OF HER LIFE.

14:07.727 --> 14:09.269
HOW SWEET IS THAT?

14:24.784 --> 14:25.825
NO!

14:32.372 --> 14:34.914
JOE, I'M SO SORRY.

14:34.915 --> 14:37.666
I WAS RUNNING THE GARBAGE
DISPOSAL AND IT JUST SLIPPED OFF.

14:37.667 --> 14:40.129
I TRIED TO TURN IT OFF, BUT IT
JUST KEPT GRINDING AND GRINDING.

14:40.130 --> 14:44.094
UNTIL THERE WAS NOTHING LEFT BUT SPARKLING
BEAUTY AND THOUGHTFUL SYMBOLISM.

14:45.175 --> 14:46.967
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT'S GONE.

14:50.770 --> 14:53.182
OOH, NO, I CAN'T DO IT.

14:53.183 --> 14:56.276
WAIT, YES I CAN. NO, I CAN'T. OH!
WHY AM I SUCH A GOOD PERSON?

14:58.278 --> 15:00.279
OH, HEY, HONEY. I DIDN'T
HEAR YOU COME HOME.

15:00.280 --> 15:03.282
YEAH, I WAS JUST WASHING THE
DIRT OFF MY BIRTHDAY PRESENT.

15:03.283 --> 15:05.904
YOU KNOW, WHY COULDN'T THE GANG
AT WORK GIVE ME A GIFT CARD?

15:05.905 --> 15:09.079
BECAUSE GIFT CARDS DON'T GET DIRTY AND THEY
DON'T DIE WHEN I FORGET TO WATER THEM.

15:11.081 --> 15:15.164
YEAH, SO, DID EVERYONE GO NUTS FOR
THE RING AT THE OFFICE THERE, HUH?

15:15.165 --> 15:17.296
- DID YOU GET A LOT OF COMPLIMENTS?
- ARE YOU KIDDING?

15:17.297 --> 15:19.379
EVERYONE NOTICED,
LOTS OF COMMENTS.

15:20.750 --> 15:22.091
HAVE YOU POSTED ANY
PICS OF IT YET?

15:22.092 --> 15:25.214
NO, YOU KNOW HOW OBNOXIOUS ALL
OF THOSE BRAGGING SELFIES ARE.

15:25.215 --> 15:27.216
LIKE, LOOK AT MY RING, BITCHES!

15:27.217 --> 15:29.178
YOU KNOW WHAT, LET ME
TAKE A PICTURE OF IT NOW.

15:29.179 --> 15:31.310
NO, NO, NO, THE LIGHTING
IN HERE ISN'T THAT GREAT.

15:31.311 --> 15:33.222
OH, IT'S OKAY, HONEY, LET'S...

15:33.223 --> 15:36.185
LET'S JUST GET ONE OF YOU SHOWING THE WORLD
EXACTLY WHAT YOU THINK OF THAT RING.

15:36.186 --> 15:38.017
YOU KNOW, HOW MUCH YOU LOVE
IT BECAUSE YOUR HUSBAND

15:38.018 --> 15:41.151
REALLY PUT HIS HEART AND SOUL INTO
MAKING IT, YOU KNOW, JUST TO SHOW YOU

15:42.522 --> 15:44.823
HOW MUCH HE LOVES YOU.

15:44.824 --> 15:46.525
LENNOX RATTED ME
OUT, DIDN'T SHE?

15:46.526 --> 15:48.197
WHY DO WE TELL HER ANYTHING?

15:48.198 --> 15:51.240
YOU THINK I DON'T KNOW YOU? YOU
SAID THE RING IS HORRIBLE.

15:51.241 --> 15:53.332
AND THEN YOU LIED TO ME.

15:53.333 --> 15:56.335
I WASN'T LYING. I WAS JUST TRYING TO SPARE
MY SWEET, ADORABLE HUSBAND'S FEELINGS.

15:56.336 --> 15:58.877
NOW LOOK, THE SWEET STUFF'S NOT
GONNA WORK ON ME. ALL RIGHT?

15:58.878 --> 16:02.211
LOOK, YOU LOOKED ME RIGHT IN THE EYE, MEL,
AND TOLD ME THINGS THAT WERE NOT TRUE.

16:02.212 --> 16:04.173
BUT IT WAS JUST A WHITE LIE.

16:04.174 --> 16:07.506
A DAZZLING, SPARKLING WHITE LIE
WRAPPED IN A PLATINUM SETTING

16:07.507 --> 16:09.389
THAT WOULD LOOK GREAT
WITH ANY OUTFIT I WEAR.

16:10.930 --> 16:14.763
WAIT A MINUTE. SO, YOU PRETEND
TO LIKE THINGS YOU DON'T.

16:14.764 --> 16:16.725
IS THAT WHAT YOU DID LAST NIGHT
WHEN WE WERE IN BED, HUH?

16:16.726 --> 16:19.058
WHEN YOU CALLED MY
NAME OUT LIKE THAT?

16:19.059 --> 16:21.310
HOW DO I KNOW YOU WEREN'T JUST
SCREAMING TO MAKE ME FEEL BETTER?

16:21.311 --> 16:22.941
I WOULD NEVER DO THAT!

16:22.942 --> 16:25.864
OH, COME ON, MEL. YOU CALLED
OUT MY MIDDLE NAME, TWICE!

16:25.865 --> 16:28.527
THAT'S HOW GOOD THE SEX WAS! I'VE NEVER
CALLED OUT A GUY'S MIDDLE NAME BEFORE.

16:28.528 --> 16:29.609
I DON'T THINK...

16:31.071 --> 16:35.204
OH, HEY, I HATE TO BREAK IN TO THIS
SUPER NONE-OF-MY-BUSINESS CONVERSATION

16:35.205 --> 16:37.706
BUT I JUST WANTED TO REMIND YOU
THAT IF YOU DON'T LEAVE NOW

16:37.707 --> 16:40.789
YOU'RE GOING TO BE LATE TO THAT MOVIE
THAT YOU GUYS WERE SO EXCITED TO SEE.

16:40.790 --> 16:43.172
GO TO A MOVIE? IN THE MIDDLE OF A FIGHT?
I DON'T THINK SO.

16:43.173 --> 16:45.294
NO, NO, NO, WE HAVE TO
GO TO THIS MOVIE, HONEY.

16:45.295 --> 16:48.387
- WE CAN SEE IT TOMORROW.
- NO, WE HAVE TO SEE IT TONIGHT.

16:48.388 --> 16:51.181
- IN FACT, SHE'S RIGHT, WE
HAVE TO LEAVE NOW. -WHY?

16:52.392 --> 16:54.474
- I CAN'T TELL YOU.
- WELL, IT'S BECAUSE...

16:56.596 --> 16:59.188
NOTHING, I'M DONE SAYING STUFF.

16:59.189 --> 17:01.440
OKAY, WHAT IS GOING ON?

17:01.441 --> 17:03.942
LISTEN, WE HAVE TO GO
TO THE MOVIE RIGHT NOW.

17:03.943 --> 17:06.855
OKAY, AND THEN WE'RE GONNA GET THERE BUT WE'RE
GOING TO BE A LITTLE EARLY FOR THE SHOW

17:06.856 --> 17:09.948
SO, WE'RE GONNA DECIDE TO GO ACROSS THE
STREET AND GRAB A DRINK AT THE NEW HOTEL.

17:09.949 --> 17:13.282
WHERE THERE WILL BE SIXTY PEOPLE
HIDING IN A DARK BANQUET ROOM

17:13.283 --> 17:16.035
READY TO JUMP OUT AND
SCREAM "HAPPY BIRTHDAY!"

17:17.157 --> 17:21.290
- A SURPRISE PARTY? -LET THE RECORD
SHOW, I SAID NOTHING ABOUT THE PARTY.

17:21.291 --> 17:24.124
NOW, IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME, I HAVE TO GO
HIDE IN THE DARK WITH YOUR WEIRD FRIENDS.

17:26.666 --> 17:29.338
SERIOUSLY? YOU PLANNED
A SURPRISE PARTY?

17:29.339 --> 17:31.300
WAIT, BUT MY BIRTHDAY
WAS YESTERDAY.

17:31.301 --> 17:32.971
I KNOW! IT WAS PART
OF MY STRATEGY.

17:32.972 --> 17:36.175
OOH, JUST LIKE THE KALE.
AGAIN, GENIUS.

17:36.176 --> 17:38.347
WELL, I'VE BEEN WORKING ON
IT FOR LIKE SIX MONTHS.

17:38.348 --> 17:40.349
I LOVE SURPRISE PARTIES,
I'VE ALWAYS WANTED ONE!

17:40.350 --> 17:42.771
I KNOW, I KNOW. GUESS WHO
I JUST GOT A TEXT FROM?

17:42.772 --> 17:45.354
SARAH MILSTEIN WHO JUST
GOT OFF THE PLANE.

17:45.355 --> 17:47.025
MILTIE? MY FRESHMAN ROOMMATE?
I LOVE HER!

17:47.026 --> 17:48.777
I KNOW.

17:48.778 --> 17:51.900
AND THE HIGHLIGHT OF THE EVENING,
HONEY, AN ICE LUGE FOR THE VODKA BAR.

17:51.901 --> 17:54.153
AN ICE LUGE? YOU MEAN WHERE THE
DRINKS GO ROUND AND ROUND AND ROUND

17:54.154 --> 17:56.785
AND COME OUT CHILLED AT THE BOTTOM?
OH, I LOVE THOSE!

17:56.786 --> 18:00.749
A SURPRISE PARTY? AN ICE LUGE?
JOE...

18:00.750 --> 18:03.582
- YOU REALLY DO KNOW ME.
- YEAH, WELL, MOST OF THE TIME.

18:03.583 --> 18:06.205
ALL RIGHT, JUST HURRY UP AND GET
READY SO WE CAN "GO SEE THE MOVIE."

18:06.206 --> 18:07.966
- WE CAN FIGHT LATER.
- NO, NO, NO.

18:07.967 --> 18:10.088
WHY WOULD I WANT TO FIGHT WITH MY
THOUGHTFUL, WONDERFUL HUSBAND?

18:10.089 --> 18:13.512
- YOU REALLY MEAN THAT?
- I DO, OF COURSE I DO!

18:13.513 --> 18:16.215
I SWEAR ON THIS BIG, UGLY RING.

18:16.216 --> 18:18.387
YOU DON'T NEED TO
BE THAT HONEST.

18:18.388 --> 18:22.311
COME ON, LET'S GET READY FOR MY PARTY.
THERE'S AN ICE LUGE WITH MY NAME ON IT.

18:22.312 --> 18:24.223
ACTUALLY, IT DOES
HAVE YOUR NAME ON IT.

18:24.224 --> 18:27.066
FOR REAL? THIS IS ALREADY
THE BEST PARTY EVER!

18:30.150 --> 18:33.822
THAT WAS SO FUN AND CRAZY!

18:33.823 --> 18:37.075
YOU KNOW HOW I KNOW? BECAUSE I
CAN'T REMEMBER A THING ABOUT IT.

18:37.076 --> 18:39.077
WAIT, WAIT!

18:39.078 --> 18:42.622
DID SARAH MILSTEIN SKINNY
DIP IN THE ICE LUGE?

18:44.414 --> 18:48.126
- YES, SHE REALLY DID.
- CLASSIC MILTIE.

18:48.127 --> 18:51.630
I CAN'T BELIEVE SHE'S LEAVING HER
HUSBAND FOR HER CHIROPRACTOR.

18:51.631 --> 18:55.384
- SHE'S WHAT?
- NOTHING.

18:55.385 --> 18:56.966
I DID NOT TELL YOU THAT.

18:58.388 --> 19:00.349
GOOD NIGHT.

19:00.350 --> 19:04.102
I LOVE MY CUTE,
BIG-MOUTHED NIECE.

19:04.103 --> 19:06.435
THAT ONE WILL NEVER
BE A MOB WIFE.

19:06.436 --> 19:09.818
HEY, HOW COME YOU DIDN'T LET ME
TAKE HOME THE LAST OF THE ICE LUGE?

19:09.819 --> 19:12.941
BECAUSE, HONEY, IT WAS A PUDDLE AND YOU
WERE DRINKING VODKA OUT OF A BUCKET.

19:12.942 --> 19:15.073
I LOVE BUCKET VODKA!

19:15.074 --> 19:16.275
I LOVE ALL VODKA.

19:16.276 --> 19:21.370
OOH, OOH, OOH, IF WE GET A
PUPPY, LET'S NAME IT VODKA.

19:21.371 --> 19:23.332
YOU SURE ABOUT THAT?
NOT, MERLOT?

19:23.333 --> 19:26.044
NO, YOU'RE RIGHT. YOU'RE RIGHT.
MERLOT IS BETTER.

19:26.045 --> 19:27.376
- OH.
- AW.

19:27.377 --> 19:31.380
YOU KNOW ME SO WELL. I HAVE THE
BEST HUSBAND IN THE WHOLE WORLD.

19:31.381 --> 19:34.713
YOU THREW ME THE BEST
BIRTHDAY PARTY, EVER!

19:34.714 --> 19:37.716
I MEAN, YOU REALLY
THREW ME OFF THE SCENT

19:37.717 --> 19:39.598
WITH THAT HORRIBLE LIFEHAMMER.

19:39.599 --> 19:41.560
THAT WAS A GREAT DECOY, RIGHT?

19:41.561 --> 19:44.893
NO, BUT SERIOUSLY? DON'T GET RID OF THAT THING.
'CAUSE IT COULD HONESTLY SAVE YOUR LIFE ONE DAY.

19:44.894 --> 19:48.518
AND THE RING? SO
FREAKING THOUGHTFUL!

19:49.649 --> 19:53.071
YEAH, NO, I MISSED THE
BOAT WITH THAT ONE.

19:53.072 --> 19:54.943
- WHAT? -YOU DON'T HAVE
TO WEAR IT, HONEY.

19:54.944 --> 19:57.277
NO, I'M WEARING IT RIGHT NOW.

19:58.408 --> 20:02.080
YOU... YOU REALLY SEE A RING ON THAT
FINGER? 'CAUSE IF YOU DO I'M...

20:02.081 --> 20:04.032
I'M EVEN HAPPIER NOW
THAT I JUST DROVE HOME.

20:04.033 --> 20:07.287
NO, I TOLD YOU I'D WEAR IT AND
I ALWAYS KEEP MY PROMISES.

20:09.419 --> 20:11.750
- YOU'RE HIDING IT?
- NO, I'M NOT HIDING IT.

20:11.751 --> 20:13.592
I'M KEEPING IT
CLOSE TO MY HEART.

20:13.593 --> 20:17.547
THAT WAY IF I EVER NEED TO FEEL THE DEPTH
OF YOUR LOVE IJUST GO LIKE THIS... WHOOO!

20:21.301 --> 20:22.722
YOU REALLY DO KNOW ME.

20:26.806 --> 20:29.147
- GOOD MORNING.
- GOOD MORNING!

20:29.148 --> 20:31.810
