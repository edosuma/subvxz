WEBVTT

00:07.275 --> 00:09.000
What do you say, Vernon?

00:09.000 --> 00:10.103
Welcome.

00:10.103 --> 00:13.034
<i>Two new arrivals
on the Golden Coast.</i>

00:13.034 --> 00:14.517
<i>Each with dreams.</i>

00:14.517 --> 00:18.103
I'll give you
a full day's pay,
free, if you'll take me.

00:18.103 --> 00:20.241
<i>And stars in their eyes.</i>

00:20.241 --> 00:21.448
I'm definitely excited.

00:21.448 --> 00:23.068
I am not nervous yet.

00:23.068 --> 00:27.344
<i>But will they make it
on mining's toughest stage?</i>

00:29.068 --> 00:30.758
Cause to mess up out here
is to die.

00:30.758 --> 00:32.034
<i>There is drama.</i>

00:32.034 --> 00:34.931
I literally
in a plastic bag this morning.

00:34.931 --> 00:36.482
<i>There is love.</i>

00:36.482 --> 00:39.137
I swear to God
I think we still have
a future together.

00:39.137 --> 00:41.551
I just don't know.

00:41.551 --> 00:43.413
Better take my temperature.
I got a fever.

00:43.413 --> 00:44.689
<i>There is riches.</i>

00:44.689 --> 00:46.103
Gold fever.

00:46.103 --> 00:47.758
<i>And there is danger.</i>

00:47.758 --> 00:49.344
I can see the hospital
right there.

00:49.344 --> 00:50.448
That's good news.

00:50.448 --> 00:53.551
Somebody on this boat
is going to die.

00:53.551 --> 00:57.137
<i>Now on</i>
As The Bering Sea Churns.

01:04.827 --> 01:06.931
A long stretch
of rough sea conditions

01:06.931 --> 01:09.896
put a squeeze
on the miners plans for summer

01:09.896 --> 01:12.379
as the gold has been hard
to come by.

01:16.000 --> 01:20.206
Now as Mother Nature opens
a window to opportunity,

01:20.206 --> 01:23.413
each member of the fleet
is looking to make
the most of it.

01:30.172 --> 01:31.620
Weather is good again.

01:31.620 --> 01:33.586
It's a calm day.
The visibility
should be improving.

01:33.586 --> 01:37.310
So we'll get out there
and see how she rolls.

01:37.310 --> 01:41.172
<i>For Emily Riedel,
that means expanding her team.</i>

01:41.172 --> 01:46.448
So this morning heading
to the airport to pick up
one Miss Jane Kilcher.

01:46.448 --> 01:47.517
I asked her to come up.

01:47.517 --> 01:49.000
She's a good friend of mine,

01:49.000 --> 01:52.793
and she's gonna help me
stand on the boat
for the rest of the season.

01:52.793 --> 01:54.344
I definitely need some
additional help,

01:54.344 --> 01:55.758
and it would be great
to have Jane around.

01:55.758 --> 01:57.551
I mean she's a hard core chick.

01:58.724 --> 02:02.103
I've set the bar
at 250 ounces this season.

02:02.103 --> 02:03.206
It will be a struggle
for sure,

02:03.206 --> 02:05.275
especially with the weather
the way that it is.

02:05.275 --> 02:06.586
<i>But I think we can do it.</i>

02:06.586 --> 02:07.724
I'm building a family,

02:07.724 --> 02:11.206
so I need to build a legacy
to go with it as well.

02:11.206 --> 02:13.586
I think the plane
is on the ground.

02:13.586 --> 02:17.241
So I think
she'll be rolling out
with her luggage here.

02:17.241 --> 02:19.068
<i>In order to get
where I need to be,</i>

02:19.068 --> 02:21.103
<i>I need to add a new member
to the team.</i>

02:21.103 --> 02:23.896
So I'm bringing up my friend
Jane Kilcher.

02:23.896 --> 02:25.482
She's someone I trust.

02:25.482 --> 02:26.551
She is a good friend of mine.

02:26.551 --> 02:29.275
And she'll bring
an Alaskan frontier attitude

02:29.275 --> 02:31.689
to this business,
which I think is much needed.

02:33.517 --> 02:34.689
- Janny.
- Hey.

02:34.689 --> 02:36.724
Hey hey.

02:36.724 --> 02:37.793
Hotter than I thought.

02:37.793 --> 02:39.137
Yes it is.

02:39.137 --> 02:40.758
It's only cause
you have your nice
feather jacket on.

02:44.896 --> 02:46.586
<i>Jane Kilcher has been living</i>

02:46.586 --> 02:48.448
<i>the Alaska frontier life
for years.</i>

02:51.586 --> 02:53.241
It's too big for us
to bring it on board.

02:53.241 --> 02:54.793
I want to shoot it.

02:54.793 --> 02:57.482
<i>Tackling every challenge
that's come her way.</i>

02:57.482 --> 03:00.206
<i>And always in her own
unique style.</i>

03:00.206 --> 03:02.379
Come on, move.

03:02.379 --> 03:03.586
Move.

03:04.931 --> 03:07.275
Excited to see muskox
and baby muskox.

03:07.275 --> 03:09.482
But I've never been
on a dredge ever.

03:09.482 --> 03:12.275
Not even--
not even been close to one.

03:15.724 --> 03:17.448
Not only have I never been
on dredge.

03:17.448 --> 03:18.655
I'm kind of going in blind.

03:18.655 --> 03:20.793
I didn't even like
look it up.

03:22.275 --> 03:25.206
<i>So obviously Jane knows
absolutely nothing</i>

03:25.206 --> 03:28.586
<i>about gold mining,
but she is an Alaskan
to the core.</i>

03:28.586 --> 03:31.448
She has had this badass,
do it yourself life.

03:31.448 --> 03:33.620
She was a commercial fisherman
for a while,

03:33.620 --> 03:35.793
and then she's been living
on a homestead
for a long time.

03:35.793 --> 03:38.448
<i>She's not afraid of anyone
or anything.</i>

03:38.448 --> 03:41.344
<i>She's perfect for Nome
and perfect for gold mining.</i>

03:41.344 --> 03:42.551
Was that your?

03:42.551 --> 03:43.896
Uh. Yeah.
That's our boat.

03:43.896 --> 03:45.448
Yeah, that's the Eroica.

03:45.448 --> 03:47.068
How is it Eroica?

03:47.068 --> 03:50.034
Yeah, uh, well,
at least they don't say Eroica.

03:50.034 --> 03:53.206
No, unless there's a lot
of PDA on your boat.

03:53.206 --> 03:54.551
I mean...

03:58.206 --> 03:59.655
I'm definitely excited.

03:59.655 --> 04:02.689
I'm not nervous yet,
but I'm looking over
at the dredge,

04:02.689 --> 04:04.379
this looks like
a floating shack.

04:16.758 --> 04:17.827
Well, dredging, the...

04:17.827 --> 04:19.068
You can say dredging, yeah.

04:19.068 --> 04:20.137
So we're going dredging.

04:20.137 --> 04:21.310
The action of dredging.

04:21.310 --> 04:22.689
You could call it sucking,
but that's...

04:22.689 --> 04:23.793
We're not sucking.

04:23.793 --> 04:24.931
- Well...
- A little bit.

04:24.931 --> 04:26.172
Yeah, dubious.

04:29.275 --> 04:31.448
Back to harbor.

04:31.448 --> 04:33.586
Honestly, I wonder
what people on the boat

04:33.586 --> 04:34.724
are gonna make of Jane.

04:34.724 --> 04:38.241
There is definitely never
quite been anyone like

04:38.241 --> 04:42.275
Jane on the Eroica
or on any other boat
in the world really.

04:43.448 --> 04:44.965
We're about
to do a shift change,

04:44.965 --> 04:46.551
so this is perfect time

04:46.551 --> 04:48.793
to kind of show her
around the boat.

04:50.517 --> 04:52.931
How do you even dredge?
I've never been on one.

04:52.931 --> 04:54.896
I'm gonna see how it works.
So I'm excited.

04:54.896 --> 04:58.137
The lease is like
a mile by a mile,

04:58.137 --> 04:59.586
and we're pretty close to it.

04:59.586 --> 05:01.068
It's like a three mile trip.

05:02.827 --> 05:04.379
<i>Most important thing
for Jane today</i>

05:04.379 --> 05:06.172
<i>is to get acclimated
to the way</i>

05:06.172 --> 05:08.379
the dredge works
as quickly as possible.

05:08.379 --> 05:10.413
Oh, we're almost there.

05:10.413 --> 05:12.206
<i>Because we just don't have
a lot of time to slow down</i>

05:12.206 --> 05:13.758
<i>and teach her what's up.</i>

05:13.758 --> 05:15.655
Time on the sluice box
is too precious,

05:15.655 --> 05:18.000
so she's just gonna
have to like jump right in,

05:18.000 --> 05:19.689
sink or swim, see how it goes.

05:29.620 --> 05:32.344
There's no rails on the boat,
bothers me greatly.

05:32.344 --> 05:33.689
I guess
I'll be doing this a lot.

05:39.620 --> 05:41.241
Very rustic.

05:53.241 --> 05:55.275
Okay.

05:55.275 --> 05:56.758
Like Darth Vader over here.

05:56.758 --> 05:57.827
That's him breathing?

06:03.689 --> 06:04.724
Oh.

06:12.758 --> 06:14.068
Yeah.

06:14.068 --> 06:16.379
That's what's making
the air for the diver.

06:18.344 --> 06:20.000
Afraid he's gonna stop breathing.

06:25.344 --> 06:27.655
My initial thoughts
is I can see the hospital
right there,

06:27.655 --> 06:28.896
that's good news.

06:30.586 --> 06:31.896
Yeah.

06:31.896 --> 06:33.620
...Straight to the hospital.

06:41.689 --> 06:43.827
We're dredging.

06:43.827 --> 06:46.275
<i>But Emily
is not the only miner
adding manpower.</i>

06:49.827 --> 06:54.034
Hey, Bryan,
hey let's go pick up Gary.

06:54.034 --> 06:57.965
Yeah, I saw the plane land
a couple of minutes ago,
so he

06:57.965 --> 07:00.896
ought to be getting his bag.

07:00.896 --> 07:05.137
<i>Vernon Adkison
is bringing in a heavy hitter
in hopes of upping his game.</i>

07:06.344 --> 07:08.000
Time getting short.

07:08.000 --> 07:11.689
The gold of getting cold
and we need to bring it up.

07:11.689 --> 07:14.241
Get the show on the road.

07:17.344 --> 07:20.931
It's been blowing like,
like a blue ball banshee,

07:20.931 --> 07:25.034
but I think that wind is just
about blown itself out.

07:25.034 --> 07:28.551
The ocean is laid down,
it's go time, it's show time,

07:28.551 --> 07:30.275
it's time to get the gold.

07:31.965 --> 07:34.172
The start of the season
has been rough.

07:34.172 --> 07:36.620
I am looking to get
300 ounces.

07:36.620 --> 07:39.413
I am looking to move
into the top tier
here in Nome.

07:39.413 --> 07:42.241
But so far it's been
one gut punch after another.

07:43.827 --> 07:45.586
But I am stepping up big.

07:45.586 --> 07:47.034
There is Gary.

07:47.034 --> 07:49.034
He is travelling light.

07:49.034 --> 07:50.965
Yeah, buddy, get some gold.

07:50.965 --> 07:52.241
Nice.

07:52.241 --> 07:53.275
Yeah.

07:54.310 --> 07:56.206
I'm expanding my dive team.

07:56.206 --> 07:58.827
I'm bringing in one of my aces
Gary Simpson.

07:58.827 --> 08:01.103
That ought to put us back
in the fast lane.

08:01.103 --> 08:02.344
Hey, Gary.

08:02.344 --> 08:03.965
It's good to be back.

08:03.965 --> 08:06.310
<i>We got the team back
together, we'll start moving.</i>

08:06.310 --> 08:08.655
<i>And that's
what it's all about,
getting that gold.</i>

08:08.655 --> 08:10.586
<i>Gary is the beast.</i>

08:10.586 --> 08:12.862
Oh! Wow!

08:12.862 --> 08:14.586
There is gold right here.

08:14.586 --> 08:16.172
There you are Gary.

08:16.172 --> 08:18.206
We've got to rename you,
you'll be the,

08:18.206 --> 08:20.379
Gary the gold gorilla.

08:22.206 --> 08:24.655
Now these two polar bears
in tow

08:24.655 --> 08:26.896
and good weather
in the forecast,

08:26.896 --> 08:30.413
we still have time
to make this season lift.

08:30.413 --> 08:31.862
I'm ready
to kick some ass out here,

08:31.862 --> 08:33.000
make some gold.

08:34.275 --> 08:36.206
Okay.
Everything ready to go?

08:36.206 --> 08:38.068
Yeah.

08:38.068 --> 08:39.551
Go out there
and get some gold.

08:41.344 --> 08:44.068
<i>But the gold ship crew
is not alone in the harbor.</i>

09:00.896 --> 09:02.034
How the hell are you?

09:05.689 --> 09:07.448
What do you say,
Vernon?

09:10.206 --> 09:12.413
You brought your weight belt
with you?

09:12.413 --> 09:13.689
No.

09:13.689 --> 09:17.034
Oh, that's the one thing
I couldn't bring.

09:17.034 --> 09:18.965
It's too heavy.

09:18.965 --> 09:22.896
But I wanted too
because I brought
every damn thing else,

09:22.896 --> 09:24.689
you could believe that.

09:24.689 --> 09:26.517
This voice calls out.

09:26.517 --> 09:30.137
And I know this voice,
even though it's been years
since I heard it.

09:30.137 --> 09:33.413
Oh, God, it's Dave Thompson.

09:33.413 --> 09:35.172
We call him Hurricane Dave.

09:35.172 --> 09:38.000
Hands down
the most intense man
I've ever known.

09:38.000 --> 09:41.172
We're talking,
hold on to your life
kind of intensity.

09:42.379 --> 09:45.896
Hey it is damn
good to see you, my friend.

09:45.896 --> 09:47.034
Dammit, brother.

09:47.034 --> 09:49.689
I've been waiting nine years
to do this Vernon.

09:49.689 --> 09:51.482
Nine [bleep] damn years.

09:51.482 --> 09:52.965
Yeah,
that's a long time to wait.

09:52.965 --> 09:55.689
I'm telling you, look,

09:55.689 --> 09:57.068
it is so good to see you.

09:58.689 --> 10:01.000
Well, it's good to see you,
too, Dave.

10:01.000 --> 10:03.758
Dave, he made
a memorable impression

10:03.758 --> 10:05.448
when he was out here
mining for me

10:05.448 --> 10:07.034
almost a decade ago.

10:09.137 --> 10:11.172
I'd love to offer
my services.

10:11.172 --> 10:12.689
No promises.

10:12.689 --> 10:14.206
But you're invited
to come down

10:14.206 --> 10:15.310
tomorrow morning
at about eight.

10:15.310 --> 10:16.655
Okay.

10:16.655 --> 10:18.379
So I am going
to get off your boat,
leave you guys alone,

10:18.379 --> 10:20.034
you all can talk about me
and decide whether,

10:20.034 --> 10:21.793
oh no, this idiot, no, no.

10:26.827 --> 10:29.241
It started with him
completely losing it

10:29.241 --> 10:33.068
when he was unimpressed
with our equipment that
we had on hand.

10:33.068 --> 10:36.862
My God, my God,
I can't believe it.

10:36.862 --> 10:40.000
They don't have
a weight belt.

10:40.000 --> 10:41.517
My God.

10:41.517 --> 10:44.724
Now to his credit,
he did manage
to pull it together.

10:44.724 --> 10:47.000
Let me get down there
and find out what's going on.

10:47.000 --> 10:49.758
Come back
and attempt one dive.

10:49.758 --> 10:52.137
But it all went to hell
in a hand basket.

10:52.137 --> 10:53.896
Pretty damn fast after that.

10:58.275 --> 11:01.172
Yeah, we got 60 pounds
of air up here Dave.

11:15.655 --> 11:19.137
What's up?
60 psi, 60.

11:19.137 --> 11:20.448
Yeah.

11:20.448 --> 11:21.689
All right, so this is it.

11:21.689 --> 11:22.931
It's over.

11:25.862 --> 11:27.482
I guess that's the end
of Dave.

11:29.862 --> 11:32.206
I thought
that was the last time
I'd ever see Dave.

11:32.206 --> 11:34.758
I mean,
why would I think otherwise?

11:34.758 --> 11:38.344
But lo and behold,
here he is as he lives
and breathes,

11:38.344 --> 11:40.689
all juiced up
and wound tighter than ever.

11:43.137 --> 11:46.724
And I have absolutely no idea
what he's doing here.

11:46.724 --> 11:48.655
I understand
you're gonna try
to leave the dock.

11:48.655 --> 11:49.965
Yeah.

11:49.965 --> 11:52.931
I'll give you
a full day's pay, free,
if you'll take me.

11:52.931 --> 11:54.758
Just let me see
what you're doing.

11:54.758 --> 11:55.827
That's it.

11:55.827 --> 11:56.931
Don't pay me a thing.

11:56.931 --> 11:59.000
You don't even have
to buy me a drink.

11:59.000 --> 12:00.896
All right.
Well, well, here's the deal.

12:00.896 --> 12:03.896
You're welcome to come
and observe and see

12:03.896 --> 12:07.137
how we do it and like I said,
we'll get things going.

12:07.137 --> 12:09.655
Well, if you're interested
in taking me on, Vernon,

12:09.655 --> 12:10.862
I'm all for that.

12:10.862 --> 12:13.482
After that,
I'll have to figure out
what I can do.

12:13.482 --> 12:16.517
If I can work with you
if we can figure
all this out,

12:16.517 --> 12:18.620
all the better,
because I really like you.

12:18.620 --> 12:21.172
And if we can't,
because you can't use me,

12:21.172 --> 12:22.827
I understand that too.

12:22.827 --> 12:24.137
Yeah.

12:26.068 --> 12:27.275
All right.

12:27.275 --> 12:28.896
Let's go have some fun.

12:28.896 --> 12:30.310
- That's what I am saying.
- Okay?

12:30.310 --> 12:31.379
Yeah.

12:31.379 --> 12:32.517
Oh, well, let me give the...

12:32.517 --> 12:33.689
Let me get out of your way.

12:33.689 --> 12:35.275
There's not much
I can do here,

12:35.275 --> 12:37.172
except stand around and watch.

12:37.172 --> 12:40.034
I don't want to stick my hands
where they don't belong.

12:40.034 --> 12:41.379
- So...
- Yeah, good stuff.

12:41.379 --> 12:43.275
Just lay low until
we get going here.

12:45.172 --> 12:47.275
I started this season
light on crew,

12:47.275 --> 12:50.034
but now I've got more divers
than I know what to do with.

12:50.034 --> 12:52.655
I don't know if Dave
will ultimately make the cut.

12:54.034 --> 12:56.448
I mean, the guy
is a commercial sponge diver.

12:56.448 --> 13:00.793
He's legit, but he's nuttier
than a squirrel on mushrooms.

13:00.793 --> 13:04.206
So we'll just have to see
how this goes.

13:04.206 --> 13:05.551
All right here we go boys.

13:13.344 --> 13:15.551
I came back to get the gold.

13:15.551 --> 13:17.344
That's it.

13:17.344 --> 13:18.793
I came here nine years ago

13:18.793 --> 13:20.482
when I first found out
about this.

13:22.172 --> 13:24.172
Didn't work out back then.

13:24.172 --> 13:27.448
I didn't fail, I learned.

13:27.448 --> 13:28.689
Who is it that said that?

13:30.137 --> 13:34.586
Right, Nelson Mandela
once said, "I don't lose.

13:34.586 --> 13:38.103
I only win or learn."

13:38.103 --> 13:40.068
I didn't lose nine years ago.

13:40.068 --> 13:44.310
I learned everything
I needed to, to come back here
and try again.

13:45.620 --> 13:47.586
And here I am, we'll see.

13:50.379 --> 13:52.241
It's a hell of a boat
you got here, Vernon.

14:08.931 --> 14:11.517
There's good gold
all around out there.

14:11.517 --> 14:13.482
We'll get on something.

14:13.482 --> 14:16.137
While seas are calm
in the east,

14:16.137 --> 14:19.068
out west on Tomcod,

14:19.068 --> 14:22.931
growing swells
are making conditions
not too swell.

14:26.241 --> 14:27.448
But back in the harbor.

14:29.620 --> 14:31.379
We're here at the barge,
ready to go,

14:31.379 --> 14:32.931
and we're on standby

14:32.931 --> 14:36.827
until the ocean calms down
just a little bit more.

14:36.827 --> 14:40.344
<i>One captain
is still hoping to get back
on the water.</i>

14:40.344 --> 14:42.586
You know, there's pretty
big swells out there

14:42.586 --> 14:44.482
and it will just kick
our ass all day with.

14:45.655 --> 14:48.137
We are so close to going,
it's disgusting.

14:50.068 --> 14:51.586
Now's it not the time
to go out.

14:51.586 --> 14:53.862
You know,
if I was to try and push it,

14:53.862 --> 14:56.586
I can actually break something
on the barge.

14:57.931 --> 14:59.172
<i>Well I don't give two [bleep]</i>

14:59.172 --> 15:00.655
<i>I just want to get
on the water.</i>

15:02.896 --> 15:05.206
<i>This is gut wrenching.</i>

15:06.827 --> 15:10.241
I went for the brass ring,
and so far
it's been a disaster.

15:10.241 --> 15:14.000
Right now, I owe 125,000
in three weeks
just to keep going.

15:14.000 --> 15:17.724
So I'm enacting
a two-prong plan just
to get back on track.

15:17.724 --> 15:22.310
Get the Mistress
and the Reaper
on the water today.

15:22.310 --> 15:24.310
But James is crying
that it's too rough

15:24.310 --> 15:25.551
to take the Mistress out.

15:26.793 --> 15:28.620
It's a freaking
excavator barge.

15:28.620 --> 15:30.241
Come on, man.

15:30.241 --> 15:31.275
Look at this.

15:33.965 --> 15:35.172
Go for it.

15:37.206 --> 15:38.482
Hey, what the [bleep].

15:40.137 --> 15:41.689
What the [bleep] dude,
you just said,

15:41.689 --> 15:43.344
we couldn't go
and they're going.

15:44.758 --> 15:47.137
I hate to be passed.

15:48.655 --> 15:50.517
We have to go.
We have to.

15:54.931 --> 15:57.000
Fire up
the thrust master, please.

15:58.758 --> 16:00.000
Okay, thank you.

16:01.379 --> 16:03.758
I hate to see
everybody going out.

16:03.758 --> 16:05.724
And my captain is a [bleep].

16:06.931 --> 16:08.724
It's really important for us
to get out there

16:08.724 --> 16:11.793
and make some money
because everybody
is going hungry.

16:11.793 --> 16:13.034
And I'm not even
joking around.

16:13.034 --> 16:14.137
We're going hungry.

16:14.137 --> 16:15.448
We need to start
making some gold.

16:15.448 --> 16:17.275
We have rent to pay.
Everybody's got bills.

16:17.275 --> 16:19.310
And we got a big payment
at the end of the month.

16:21.655 --> 16:23.655
Thank God
we're on our way out.

16:28.862 --> 16:31.310
Dude, we should
have been out here hours ago.

16:31.310 --> 16:32.862
Look at how flat this is.

16:34.000 --> 16:37.206
James is too conservative
for my liking.

16:37.206 --> 16:39.034
And I don't really give

16:39.034 --> 16:42.068
how much I have to argue
with James to get out here.

16:42.068 --> 16:43.896
I just don't want to hear
people bitching saying,

16:43.896 --> 16:45.689
I don't want to go out.

16:45.689 --> 16:47.724
And it's not that
I don't want to go out.

16:47.724 --> 16:50.241
I just want to be able
to go out and go mining.

16:50.241 --> 16:53.241
And I mean, I admit
you don't want to draft

16:53.241 --> 16:55.103
your $2 million operation.

16:55.103 --> 16:56.827
You definitely don't.

16:56.827 --> 16:59.758
But if your $2 million operation

16:59.758 --> 17:01.310
doesn't make any gold,

17:01.310 --> 17:04.172
it's a sack [bleep] you know,
so, you know,

17:04.172 --> 17:06.862
like it's, it's kind of like
a fine line

17:06.862 --> 17:10.448
of what we can get away
with this season.

17:10.448 --> 17:13.517
And I personally think
this boat is a battleship.

17:13.517 --> 17:15.172
It can handle
a lot of action.

17:15.172 --> 17:16.965
It can handle some damage.

17:16.965 --> 17:19.000
Is port spud ready to drop?

17:22.655 --> 17:23.827
Okay, we're on our spot.

17:23.827 --> 17:26.413
We're dropping the spud
into place.

17:26.413 --> 17:29.482
Every hour we're now running
is $400 that we lose.

17:29.482 --> 17:31.034
We're ready to turn
everything on

17:31.034 --> 17:32.896
and finally start making
some money.

17:36.310 --> 17:37.965
I'm ready for the shaker.

17:37.965 --> 17:39.103
Okay.

17:41.000 --> 17:42.103
Good.

17:45.551 --> 17:48.931
James really didn't even think
we were going out today.

17:48.931 --> 17:52.000
And I mean, I admit
there is a little bit
of a swell.

17:53.620 --> 17:55.448
What the
you expect this ocean

17:55.448 --> 17:57.620
to be like a lake thing
out here and make money.

18:09.413 --> 18:12.517
Dude, I'm just trying
to hold on and,

18:12.517 --> 18:15.034
you know, wait for these sets
to calm down a second.

18:15.034 --> 18:17.068
But I can't
dig in this.

18:17.068 --> 18:19.965
I'm getting
kicked out of me.

18:19.965 --> 18:22.862
Probably [bleep] break
something. 'Nother [bleep] big
set coming in.

18:22.862 --> 18:24.310
hold on Michael.

18:39.379 --> 18:40.586
Yeah. Hang on.

18:43.275 --> 18:44.379
I can't...

18:54.413 --> 18:55.896
The swells
are pretty deceiving.

18:55.896 --> 18:57.724
That's what I keep trying
to tell everybody.

18:57.724 --> 19:02.000
Right now this
these swells
are kicking our ass.

19:09.655 --> 19:11.000
Kelly?

19:11.000 --> 19:12.379
What's up?

19:14.275 --> 19:15.448
What's up?

19:15.448 --> 19:16.758
A little too rough.

19:16.758 --> 19:17.827
Yeah.

19:28.931 --> 19:33.103
God, these swells are
spuds and spud wells.

19:33.103 --> 19:34.689
This is gonna snap one.

19:46.827 --> 19:48.655
I don't know
what to do.

19:48.655 --> 19:49.965
I don't know what to do.

19:51.896 --> 19:56.137
I was kind of forced
to come out here and,

19:56.137 --> 20:00.758
you know, push it,
but I never wanted to.

20:00.758 --> 20:02.689
Yeah, okay.

20:02.689 --> 20:04.689
It is a little too swelly.

20:06.551 --> 20:07.758
Let's go home.

20:12.379 --> 20:14.068
<i>I'm the boss
of this operation,</i>

20:14.068 --> 20:16.068
<i>and I have to make
tough calls.</i>

20:16.068 --> 20:18.965
Kevin supplies money,
but he's back in the lower 48.

20:18.965 --> 20:21.965
So, look, it's just me now,
and I thought James was wrong,

20:21.965 --> 20:23.724
but this time it turned out
he was right.

20:25.310 --> 20:26.827
Those swells
don't look like much,

20:26.827 --> 20:28.310
but they're deceptive as hell.

20:29.793 --> 20:31.344
We're getting beat [bleep].

20:31.344 --> 20:32.655
But we'll stop for the morning

20:32.655 --> 20:34.137
and we'll go back
in a few hours.

20:34.137 --> 20:35.310
We've got to keep trying.

20:40.655 --> 20:42.793
Well [bleep] stop.

20:42.793 --> 20:45.724
I am sorry I keep pushing
us into things.

20:45.724 --> 20:47.931
And I got to get out of here
and make this work.

20:47.931 --> 20:50.517
And I get bummed out
when I feel like
I'm working for free.

20:54.896 --> 20:57.379
Eventually I'm gonna get
tired of saying I told you so,

20:57.379 --> 20:58.793
and something major
is gonna break

20:58.793 --> 21:01.448
and they're gonna look at me
and oh my god, well,

21:01.448 --> 21:03.103
what [bleep] did you expect?

21:03.103 --> 21:06.000
I think Kris is gonna
hopefully start listening.

21:06.000 --> 21:09.275
And if he start
to see the reality,

21:09.275 --> 21:10.379
no matter what I do,

21:10.379 --> 21:12.586
what I say, I don't think
they're ever gonna

21:12.586 --> 21:16.379
understand the ocean
and what it's like to work
on a [bleep] splendid barge.

21:18.068 --> 21:19.724
It's not a dredge,
we're not on anchor.

21:21.034 --> 21:23.793
It's just depressing,
you know, very depressing.

21:23.793 --> 21:25.413
We didn't make
any money at all.

21:29.103 --> 21:31.896
So I'm on an expensive
boat ride with no drinks.

21:40.896 --> 21:42.965
Wow, amazing.

21:45.172 --> 21:48.000
Oh, it actually
looks pretty good, huh?

21:48.000 --> 21:50.241
<i>While he waits
for swells to die down,</i>

21:50.241 --> 21:52.034
Kris Kelly has got
another shot

21:52.034 --> 21:55.172
at testing the new Reaper
in the flat waters
of the harbor.

21:56.620 --> 21:58.620
Feeling real lucky
it should.

21:58.620 --> 22:00.517
You're permitted
to come aboard.

22:02.344 --> 22:04.896
Well, we're just gonna test
start up the engines,

22:04.896 --> 22:08.103
test everything out,
make sure we have
no major problems.

22:13.724 --> 22:15.517
To make
Reaper Nation a reality,

22:15.517 --> 22:17.620
it's supposed to be
a two-pronged assault.

22:17.620 --> 22:18.862
I head up the Mistress.

22:18.862 --> 22:20.724
My dad and brother
run the Reaper.

22:20.724 --> 22:22.344
The swells are too big
for the Mistress.

22:22.344 --> 22:24.655
I'm gonna see if those clowns
got the Reaper ready.

22:26.172 --> 22:28.896
Judging by the fact my dad
was too lazy to show up,

22:28.896 --> 22:30.206
I'm not optimistic.

22:34.034 --> 22:37.206
Well, do you need
to shorten that anchor line

22:37.206 --> 22:40.275
on that back
because that's way
too [bleep].

22:40.275 --> 22:43.000
Start to prime the system
and let's go through
the motions.

22:57.827 --> 22:58.931
There's no gas in it.

22:58.931 --> 23:00.137
No, I thought Dad...

23:00.137 --> 23:01.482
I'm not gonna say it dude.

23:04.448 --> 23:05.517
Okay, let's...

23:05.517 --> 23:07.827
We obviously
didn't come prepared.

23:07.827 --> 23:09.827
No, because, you know,
you ask dad to do

23:09.827 --> 23:11.172
the simplest thing
and he can't do it.

23:21.344 --> 23:22.862
Hop that thing.

23:22.862 --> 23:24.000
Idle up.

23:31.275 --> 23:33.137
The hose is like
three feet too long

23:33.137 --> 23:35.344
because it's just binding up
on everything.

23:35.344 --> 23:37.482
You guys have
everything off [bleep].

23:39.931 --> 23:42.137
Have a go at dad
not me.

23:42.137 --> 23:44.379
Buddy, in order for us
to succeed this season,

23:44.379 --> 23:47.137
we're gonna not
have to blame things
on our dad.

23:47.137 --> 23:49.000
Oh, well,
he's the one
that [bleep] it up,

23:49.000 --> 23:50.172
whom I supposed to blame,
Kris?

23:50.172 --> 23:51.862
Well, you're supposed
to do it yourself.

23:54.241 --> 23:56.758
Two major things
I've noticed
with this test so far.

23:56.758 --> 23:59.034
One, the Reaper
is a dumpster fire.

23:59.034 --> 24:02.172
Nothing is set up right,
the system is messed up.

24:02.172 --> 24:05.137
And two, Andy's instinct
is just blame my dad.

24:06.413 --> 24:07.862
Yes, my dad is a disaster.

24:07.862 --> 24:09.137
We know that.

24:09.137 --> 24:11.724
But Andy needs to step up
and start acting
like a captain.

24:11.724 --> 24:13.793
Time for me
to crack the whip.

24:13.793 --> 24:15.379
You have too much
rope on this.

24:15.379 --> 24:16.827
You need to shorten this up.

24:16.827 --> 24:18.724
that whole set up
is not gonna work.

24:18.724 --> 24:20.310
Try doing that
when the waves are big

24:20.310 --> 24:21.413
and you're gonna be sorry.

24:21.413 --> 24:22.586
You need clamps for that.

24:22.586 --> 24:24.551
That cleat is not gonna
support the anchor.

24:24.551 --> 24:27.827
Of course you guys put
the battery on the foul line.

24:27.827 --> 24:30.931
You didn't even try to dial
this boat in at all.

24:30.931 --> 24:32.586
That rope needs
to come up.

24:32.586 --> 24:34.034
The pickup points are wrong.

24:34.034 --> 24:36.793
The foot valves,
the crane at the front,

24:36.793 --> 24:40.000
the gas, I don't even think
that gas system is gonna work.

24:41.586 --> 24:44.206
Oh man,
this whole system is [bleep].

24:46.827 --> 24:48.448
You guys aren't gonna
make it anywhere.

24:48.448 --> 24:49.655
Pull that anchor up.

24:49.655 --> 24:51.793
Start the outboard.
Let's get back.

24:51.793 --> 24:54.379
Everything is
on this boat.

24:54.379 --> 24:57.172
That's what my dad
is good at.

24:57.172 --> 25:00.206
<i>And all I'm hearing
is a lot of it blaming my dad
for all of this.</i>

25:00.206 --> 25:01.655
What was that?

25:01.655 --> 25:04.000
All I'm hearing is everything
that's going wrong,

25:04.000 --> 25:06.172
you're just, that's dad's,
that's dad's fault,
that's dad's fault.

25:06.172 --> 25:07.724
That's dad's fault
is over there.

25:07.724 --> 25:09.517
You have to take accountability
for your own [bleep].

25:09.517 --> 25:10.724
I am [bleep].

25:10.724 --> 25:13.379
I need you
to [bleep] run this thing.

25:13.379 --> 25:15.862
Okay, well,
good job then.

25:15.862 --> 25:18.103
Good job at all this.

25:18.103 --> 25:19.758
Where is my other
partners then?

25:19.758 --> 25:21.068
Who is your other partner?

25:21.068 --> 25:23.344
You need to be able
to do this yourself.

25:23.344 --> 25:25.034
So why do I need dad
on the boat for then?

25:25.034 --> 25:26.862
Dude, you know,
it's like right now
stop worrying

25:26.862 --> 25:28.344
about dad all the time, you...

25:28.344 --> 25:30.000
What do I need him for?

25:30.000 --> 25:31.586
Well, what are you doing
on the boat,

25:31.586 --> 25:33.448
man everything
is all [bleep] up.

25:33.448 --> 25:35.137
You can't run this boat
by yourself.

25:35.137 --> 25:36.931
You obviously need dad.

25:36.931 --> 25:39.586
You obviously need him next
to you every second

25:39.586 --> 25:41.586
because why isn't everything
going?

25:41.586 --> 25:42.724
Everything that [bleep] up,

25:42.724 --> 25:44.000
but not everything
that's dad's work.

25:45.068 --> 25:46.137
Do you see
what I mean?

25:46.137 --> 25:48.206
Put the air compressor,
put the air lines.

25:48.206 --> 25:50.379
Oh, yeah, buddy,
that was all dad, not me.

25:53.517 --> 25:55.000
So if I have to go
over dad's work,

25:55.000 --> 25:56.068
what do I need dad for?

25:56.068 --> 25:57.413
You,
because you're...

25:57.413 --> 25:58.620
You guys are [bleep] equals.

25:58.620 --> 26:01.344
So obviously, you can't do
anything without dad,

26:01.344 --> 26:02.586
because right now dad
is not here.

26:02.586 --> 26:03.689
Nothing is working.

26:03.689 --> 26:05.724
Start the [bleep] please.

26:19.517 --> 26:21.000
How the
you think it went?

26:25.931 --> 26:28.793
We got to fix the water
on this boat.

26:28.793 --> 26:31.068
And we need to do it today.

26:31.068 --> 26:33.965
<i>While things on the Reaper
are stirred up.</i>

26:33.965 --> 26:35.344
<i>On the other side
of the harbor.</i>

26:37.724 --> 26:40.827
<i>Security, security,
security, Little Irene,</i>

26:40.827 --> 26:43.310
leaving the inner harbor,
heading for sea.

26:44.655 --> 26:46.137
<i>Mr. Gold's gotten word,</i>

26:46.137 --> 26:49.275
<i>swells on the Tomcod
have receded.</i>

26:49.275 --> 26:51.586
We finally got
a good weather window.

26:51.586 --> 26:54.482
Getting out,
we're going digging.

26:54.482 --> 26:57.344
<i>And you don't have
to tell Mr. Gold twice.</i>

26:57.344 --> 27:00.206
This is the one,
this is the run make some,

27:00.206 --> 27:01.862
something amazing happen.

27:03.000 --> 27:04.137
What's going to happen?

27:04.137 --> 27:07.689
We got high, high,
high north winds coming.

27:07.689 --> 27:09.517
You got to pull that
water out,

27:09.517 --> 27:11.965
it's gonna drop it down
and we're gonna be able

27:11.965 --> 27:14.413
to take out to that
next beach line

27:14.413 --> 27:17.000
that is just out of the reach
of the Myrtle.

27:18.413 --> 27:21.655
So I can hit that
next beach line
for four or five days,

27:21.655 --> 27:23.000
we're gonna do really well.

27:25.103 --> 27:26.793
<i>The north winds
have come in.</i>

27:26.793 --> 27:29.586
<i>That calms the swells,
pushes the water out,</i>

27:29.586 --> 27:32.034
<i>and it's gonna allow me
to get to this beach line</i>

27:32.034 --> 27:34.344
<i>I've been wanting
to get to forever.</i>

27:34.344 --> 27:37.586
It's been too deep,
inaccessible until now.

27:37.586 --> 27:41.068
And this spot should
be absolutely packed
with good stuff.

27:41.068 --> 27:43.068
And this is exactly
what we need.

27:43.068 --> 27:45.862
Since the Myrtle has been
on the bench
for at least a week.

27:49.931 --> 27:52.310
Just get another claim.

27:52.310 --> 27:54.620
I'm gonna start doing
some test pans.

27:54.620 --> 27:56.310
See what we got here.

28:02.241 --> 28:05.413
And it takes a while
to get used to everybody
does it different.

28:05.413 --> 28:07.379
Everybody likes their own
way of doing it.

28:08.620 --> 28:10.482
There should,
should be some gold here.

28:14.620 --> 28:16.620
We want to see a smiley face.

28:19.344 --> 28:21.793
Few pieces,
not what we're looking for.

28:26.724 --> 28:28.620
We're going to go ahead
and move.

28:29.862 --> 28:31.000
Oh, you're good, go up.

28:44.689 --> 28:46.103
Let me try another.

28:48.758 --> 28:50.655
Come on,
I want to see some cheese.

28:55.137 --> 28:57.965
I don't feel real hot about
how we're doing right now.

28:57.965 --> 29:02.551
But you know what,
if we keep pushing through
we're going to find it.

29:14.344 --> 29:16.206
No spot up.

29:17.310 --> 29:18.517
Crap.

29:23.310 --> 29:27.275
I got all my old points
on the GPS
from the Christine Rose.

29:30.551 --> 29:31.724
Let's go to that.

29:33.379 --> 29:36.000
Nine years ago I tried digging
in that area

29:36.000 --> 29:37.724
and there was really
good gold,

29:37.724 --> 29:42.241
but it was too deep a material
for the Christine Rose
to dig in.

29:42.241 --> 29:45.310
But I'm hoping that the Myrtle
is the machine

29:45.310 --> 29:47.586
that will dig in that area
really good.

29:47.586 --> 29:51.931
So we're gonna ahead,
get into the middle
of this area

29:51.931 --> 29:54.620
and see if we could get
to the bottom of it.

29:56.413 --> 29:57.620
Hopefully it's good.

29:59.517 --> 30:01.793
Myrtle is an absolute
game changer for me.

30:01.793 --> 30:04.310
It can go to the depths
of 25 feet

30:04.310 --> 30:07.103
where the Christine Rose
can only go to 19.

30:07.103 --> 30:09.620
And it has a six yard bucket.

30:09.620 --> 30:11.206
Those extra feet
are critical.

30:11.206 --> 30:13.896
It opens up ground
I've wanted to mine for years.

30:15.413 --> 30:17.413
All right boys,
we're in the spot.

30:20.724 --> 30:22.448
See what the hell
we can find here?

30:22.448 --> 30:24.931
Hoping to see some sand on top

30:24.931 --> 30:29.517
because all the suction
dredgers don't like sand,

30:29.517 --> 30:31.172
so they stay away from it.

30:32.241 --> 30:33.551
But this thing doesn't care

30:33.551 --> 30:35.655
whether there is two,
three feet of sand,

30:35.655 --> 30:37.103
it will dig
right through it.

30:38.517 --> 30:39.793
Oh, we got sand.

30:41.068 --> 30:44.896
Come on, show me some gravel
underneath there.

30:46.482 --> 30:48.862
Good, there is some
gravel under there.

30:48.862 --> 30:50.103
Yes, there is.

30:52.862 --> 30:55.482
If there is any gold in here,
it will be in this bucket.

31:13.103 --> 31:16.862
Yeah, that's what I am talking about.

31:16.862 --> 31:18.689
Uh-huh!

31:18.689 --> 31:19.965
That's some good stuff.

31:21.206 --> 31:23.827
Dylan has got a smile
on his face.

31:23.827 --> 31:26.344
There's only one thing
that puts a smile on my face.

31:31.344 --> 31:32.586
Fire everything up,

31:32.586 --> 31:37.965
prime the pump, make gold.

31:37.965 --> 31:39.103
Woo!

31:46.172 --> 31:47.413
We are good to go.

31:59.931 --> 32:01.068
Oh he is coming up.

32:02.655 --> 32:05.034
Wow, God,
that is some contraption.

32:06.551 --> 32:07.793
This is all very crazy.

32:07.793 --> 32:09.206
I'm gonna be using
that word a lot

32:09.206 --> 32:11.172
because that is what it is.

32:11.172 --> 32:12.620
But it's super cool.

32:12.620 --> 32:14.068
I am definitely afraid
to fall over.

32:16.448 --> 32:18.344
No, whaling.

32:18.344 --> 32:20.586
<i>As captain Emily
expands the team,</i>

32:20.586 --> 32:23.793
<i>her newest recruit
is getting a crash course
in dredging.</i>

32:27.620 --> 32:28.689
Yes.

32:30.275 --> 32:31.793
Oh, wow.

32:36.758 --> 32:38.172
Oh wow.

32:38.172 --> 32:40.137
Yeah.
Oh my God.

32:40.137 --> 32:41.344
This is a lot of gold.

32:41.344 --> 32:43.310
I just got here too.

32:43.310 --> 32:44.655
That's crazy, Emily.

32:44.655 --> 32:46.034
Get back to work guys.

32:47.310 --> 32:49.517
Oh my God, looks like
you're buying dinner.

32:51.137 --> 32:52.793
It can be life
altering to see gold

32:52.793 --> 32:54.724
in that sluice box
for the first time,

32:54.724 --> 32:56.000
and we're killing it today.

32:56.000 --> 32:58.379
<i>So I think Jane
is loving it so far.</i>

32:58.379 --> 33:02.310
And I think it's inevitable
she's gonna develop insane
gold fever.

33:05.689 --> 33:07.103
It's like a jewelry shop
down there.

33:07.103 --> 33:08.827
- It's so much gold.
- Yeah.

33:08.827 --> 33:11.482
So it's super nice to have
Jane's energy on the boat.

33:11.482 --> 33:13.551
She's funny.
She adds a lot of pizzazz.

33:13.551 --> 33:16.620
<i>There has been a lot of surly,
minor dudes on this boat</i>

33:16.620 --> 33:18.655
<i>over the years,
so it's really nice to have</i>

33:18.655 --> 33:21.206
a badass woman on the team.

33:21.206 --> 33:25.344
So this is a motor,
it's a 100 horse diesel motor,

33:25.344 --> 33:27.000
and it's connected
to the pump.

33:36.172 --> 33:37.793
Purred like a cat.

33:37.793 --> 33:39.931
Things are making sense.

33:39.931 --> 33:42.448
But I get is that
it's really loud on this boat
all the time.

33:51.586 --> 33:53.689
Oh, you did down here.

33:53.689 --> 33:54.862
Oh, it's heavy.

34:04.931 --> 34:06.137
Okay.

34:15.827 --> 34:18.034
What's my air pressure at?

34:18.034 --> 34:20.793
Looks like
the air pressure is at 200.

34:20.793 --> 34:22.275
200?

34:22.275 --> 34:23.586
20.

34:23.586 --> 34:26.724
I am gonna put my glasses on,
it's 20, seriously.

34:31.965 --> 34:33.413
I wonder if he knows
I'm eating his wheat thins.

34:41.034 --> 34:42.965
Okay, we weigh them.

34:42.965 --> 34:45.448
Yeah, so you can ask
them how the gold is.

34:45.448 --> 34:46.689
Okay.

34:46.689 --> 34:48.000
How the visibility is?

34:50.137 --> 34:51.482
How is the visibility?

34:55.655 --> 34:57.000
Ooh.

34:57.000 --> 34:58.448
How is the gold looking?

35:02.862 --> 35:04.448
Wow.

35:12.000 --> 35:13.586
Cause to mess up out here
is to die.

35:13.586 --> 35:14.655
That's awesome.

35:14.655 --> 35:16.172
Thanks, everybody.

35:16.172 --> 35:19.034
Thanks, Nome
and all your crazies.

35:19.034 --> 35:21.931
Like everybody here is crazy,
whoa, whoa, whoa, hands down.

35:21.931 --> 35:24.206
There is gold,
so I see why it's worth it.

35:24.206 --> 35:26.206
Looks like a jewelry shop
in the little sluice box.

35:26.206 --> 35:31.620
We have a beautiful day,
and everybody is getting
along on this boat.

35:31.620 --> 35:33.103
And there's lots of gold
in this sluice box.

35:33.103 --> 35:36.482
So, rock and rolling
down there.

35:38.137 --> 35:39.275
<i>One mile east.</i>

35:43.103 --> 35:45.758
We're looking
quite predictive.

35:45.758 --> 35:48.620
We're trying to find the spot
that we call easy gold.

35:48.620 --> 35:50.413
That's what we're doing.

35:50.413 --> 35:52.896
<i>With his A team
finally reassembled</i>

35:52.896 --> 35:54.655
<i>and the wild card in the mix.</i>

35:54.655 --> 35:58.586
Three forty seven,
we ought to be
getting pretty close.

35:58.586 --> 36:00.000
Yeah.

36:00.000 --> 36:02.586
<i>Vernon Adkinson
is hoping for his first</i>

36:02.586 --> 36:04.413
<i>hot streak of the summer.</i>

36:04.413 --> 36:08.310
I'm showing up about 800 feet
from the spot we got marked.

36:10.827 --> 36:14.586
We're looking for a location
I've deemed easy gold.

36:14.586 --> 36:17.379
It's a little spot
that I've kept up my sleeve

36:17.379 --> 36:21.965
just for an occasion like this
when we're desperate to get
on good stuff fast.

36:24.344 --> 36:25.758
All right, here we go boys.

36:25.758 --> 36:28.517
We are here back on that
easy gold site.

36:32.448 --> 36:34.758
Okay.
We're right over the spot.

36:34.758 --> 36:37.000
All right drop rear anchor. Good.

36:37.000 --> 36:38.965
Now the trick
is to set the anchor

36:38.965 --> 36:41.482
just right
so the boat will stay there.

36:41.482 --> 36:42.793
It's got a lot of current
out here,

36:42.793 --> 36:45.344
and we get drug
all over the place.

36:45.344 --> 36:47.275
Put out about 50 feet,

36:47.275 --> 36:50.068
and let's see
what this current is gonna do.

36:50.068 --> 36:52.827
<i>The problem is the wind
and current spin the boat</i>

36:52.827 --> 36:54.896
<i>around like a rag doll.</i>

36:54.896 --> 36:56.965
<i>So you got to dump
the anchor ahead</i>

36:56.965 --> 36:59.137
<i>of where you want
the boat to end up.</i>

36:59.137 --> 37:03.000
It's a precision art form,
but I've gotten it down
to a science.

37:05.310 --> 37:08.137
Right now I'm just letting
the current take us

37:08.137 --> 37:10.620
and settle into the anchor.

37:10.620 --> 37:12.000
And we'll stay here
pretty close

37:12.000 --> 37:13.586
to where we put this
damn thing.

37:24.068 --> 37:26.241
All right, then it is
coming around some.

37:27.310 --> 37:29.965
Eventually both anchors
will bite in,

37:29.965 --> 37:32.379
the boat will settle into
the land and that's where

37:32.379 --> 37:33.655
we'll stay for a while.

37:43.655 --> 37:45.965
The last time we let it
settle to the anchor,

37:45.965 --> 37:47.862
the anchor line
was going like that.

37:47.862 --> 37:50.068
This time it's over
in this direction.

37:50.068 --> 37:52.896
I think ultimately
it will settle back

37:52.896 --> 37:56.034
to where the anchor line
is leading in that direction.

37:56.034 --> 37:57.517
In the meantime,

37:57.517 --> 38:01.551
we got a stern line out
with a stern anchor on it,

38:01.551 --> 38:03.620
and hopefully
we'll stay here pretty close

38:03.620 --> 38:05.034
to where we put this
damn thing.

38:07.344 --> 38:08.551
We're holding
pretty good.

38:09.551 --> 38:11.689
Dave, you stand back there
and keep an eye on

38:11.689 --> 38:13.551
what's happening
with that anchor.

38:13.551 --> 38:15.310
Don't let me run
over that anchor line.

38:15.310 --> 38:16.448
You betcha.

38:18.000 --> 38:21.379
You always anchor
with the tide.

38:21.379 --> 38:23.689
The tide is coming in.

38:23.689 --> 38:25.931
The winds are coming
from the south.

38:25.931 --> 38:29.896
If he had anchored that way
on the other side

38:29.896 --> 38:32.793
of the cobble
he would have drifted

38:32.793 --> 38:34.137
right over top of it,

38:34.137 --> 38:36.965
but he anchored on top
of the cobble

38:36.965 --> 38:40.517
which is why the boat moved
east 56 feet.

38:41.758 --> 38:43.275
But I ain't arguing
with anybody.

38:43.275 --> 38:44.379
That ain't happening.

38:49.758 --> 38:52.310
It looks like
it's gonna hang
right about here.

38:52.310 --> 38:54.482
You know there is no sense
in fighting it anymore.

38:54.482 --> 38:55.827
It's like a damn toothache.

38:55.827 --> 38:58.241
We are here,
so let's just go ahead

38:58.241 --> 39:01.482
and get our stuff together
and get about our business.

39:04.034 --> 39:05.931
I am going to lower the jet
down into the water,

39:05.931 --> 39:08.517
and then we're fire it up,
and I'm going down.

39:12.241 --> 39:13.931
Be careful under there.

39:13.931 --> 39:16.827
Just keep track
of where that umbilical
is at all times.

39:16.827 --> 39:18.689
- Yeah.
- Try not to get hung up on it.

39:20.034 --> 39:21.586
I'm not beating
around the bush.

39:21.586 --> 39:23.586
We're getting killed
this summer so far.

39:24.758 --> 39:25.862
Feel good.

39:25.862 --> 39:29.034
Hopefully we're on that
easy gold site

39:29.034 --> 39:32.068
and Gary can drop down
and start filling that barge

39:32.068 --> 39:34.965
fast because God knows
we need it.

39:34.965 --> 39:36.482
Gary,
can you hear me?

39:36.482 --> 39:38.137
Yeah, I can hear you.

39:38.137 --> 39:39.379
Okay.

39:44.034 --> 39:45.137
Coming down.

39:50.344 --> 39:52.689
All right. All systems okay.

39:52.689 --> 39:53.965
All systems are go.

39:56.931 --> 39:58.344
Okay, everything feels good.

40:08.896 --> 40:11.655
Okay it's on
you're at 17.7 feet.

40:11.655 --> 40:13.413
- 18 feet.
- Okay.

40:31.137 --> 40:33.586
What the [bleep].

40:33.586 --> 40:35.551
I really don't like the way
it looks here.

40:38.689 --> 40:40.344
What [bleep] show.

40:51.896 --> 40:53.862
Okay, so standby I guess.

40:53.862 --> 40:55.689
We're trying to figure it
out right now.

40:57.068 --> 40:58.482
We slipped anchor bad.

40:59.724 --> 41:02.344
We're at 300 feet
from where we dropped.

41:02.344 --> 41:05.344
Yeah, I think what happened
when we turn the sluice on,

41:05.344 --> 41:07.586
power of the sluice
box moving the water

41:07.586 --> 41:09.344
kind of pushed us
and moved the boat.

41:12.206 --> 41:13.379
[bleep] Dammit.

41:16.793 --> 41:19.034
I don't know why in the hell
we're not on easy gold.

41:19.034 --> 41:21.827
I don't know
if the coordinates
were not right

41:21.827 --> 41:23.793
or if we're getting pushed off
by the current.

41:24.793 --> 41:26.206
But for whatever
the reason is,

41:26.206 --> 41:28.965
we're on more sand
than pebble beach right now.

41:31.482 --> 41:33.344
This is a polite way
of saying this.

41:35.034 --> 41:37.896
He does things
differently than I do.

41:37.896 --> 41:40.103
I would never
have set this boat

41:40.103 --> 41:42.206
up like this ever.

41:42.206 --> 41:45.241
We're sitting on a spot
that's worthless.

41:54.931 --> 41:57.379
Little excited. I got
a lot of things on the line.

41:57.379 --> 42:00.448
Our first real weather window
is opening up.

42:00.448 --> 42:04.103
It's a little bit cloudy,
cold, but the ocean is flat.

42:04.103 --> 42:05.310
I can go digging.

42:05.310 --> 42:07.793
Tide's pushed way out,
we can grab gold out

42:07.793 --> 42:09.206
that we never got
to grab before.

42:12.862 --> 42:14.517
So the waves kicked our ass
this morning

42:14.517 --> 42:16.551
and my dad
and brother's incompetence

42:16.551 --> 42:18.379
demoralized me even more.

42:20.241 --> 42:22.827
When we tested the Reaper
in the harbor,

42:22.827 --> 42:25.931
man, I was pissed,
and I'm trying
not to yell at everybody.

42:25.931 --> 42:27.586
I didn't see
what happened.

42:27.586 --> 42:30.172
Oh, nothing good.
Nothing good happened.

42:32.344 --> 42:34.689
So while these two idiots
are fixing everything,

42:34.689 --> 42:37.724
the currents died down
and I can go back
to work with the Mistress.

42:39.206 --> 42:42.137
And we're so far behind
to make those payments
in three weeks,

42:42.137 --> 42:43.758
we need
a record day today.

42:43.758 --> 42:46.034
So we're going back
to where we were finding gold

42:46.034 --> 42:47.413
before all this
stuff happened.

42:57.448 --> 42:59.000
Hell, yeah.

43:00.862 --> 43:02.068
I know.

43:02.965 --> 43:05.448
All right, finally, digging.

43:10.344 --> 43:11.896
Yeah, baby.

43:23.241 --> 43:27.103
I'm not really liking
this material.
It's really sandy.

43:27.103 --> 43:28.689
I'm gonna dig down
a little bit deeper

43:28.689 --> 43:30.103
and see what we get into.

43:33.448 --> 43:34.827
No big cobble.

43:34.827 --> 43:36.793
I don't know
if we're on gold yet.

43:36.793 --> 43:38.931
They have to tell me
if I'm on gold.

44:10.344 --> 44:12.620
You don't just come out here

44:12.620 --> 44:14.827
and land on gold
that's at there.

44:14.827 --> 44:16.689
You got to go prospect.

44:19.206 --> 44:20.413
Ready to rock and roll.

44:22.379 --> 44:24.000
Make that gold.

44:27.793 --> 44:31.275
Yeah, right now
it's all about feeling
around little.

44:31.275 --> 44:33.620
I feel roughly
some hard packs,

44:33.620 --> 44:35.103
some cobbles and something.

44:45.758 --> 44:47.103
He'll make it work, though.

44:54.068 --> 44:56.379
There's some bigger rocks
starting to show up,

44:57.275 --> 44:58.758
looks too clean, though.

45:03.068 --> 45:05.965
Being an owner
of an excavator barge
is brutal.

45:05.965 --> 45:08.517
Its less hands on control.

45:08.517 --> 45:10.793
With the suction dredge,
I can go underneath the water

45:10.793 --> 45:12.344
and find gold myself.

45:12.931 --> 45:15.068
There we go.

45:15.068 --> 45:18.034
With the Mistress,
all I can do
is test and watch,

45:18.034 --> 45:20.172
keep my fingers crossed
and hope.

45:20.172 --> 45:23.206
It's like a helpless feeling
while I watch us burn money.

45:32.551 --> 45:35.000
Man [bleep] this is soup.

45:52.137 --> 45:54.620
Yeah. I'm just trying to see
where they're lining up at.

45:54.620 --> 45:59.000
There might be something
they know that I don't know.

45:59.000 --> 46:01.724
You know, this could be
the edge of the paystreak

46:01.724 --> 46:03.655
and where they're heading
could be the beginning.

46:04.586 --> 46:07.275
So I'm gonna hit on that
same pay zone,

46:07.275 --> 46:10.172
and we'll try and stay
on the same course,
go east and west.

46:11.586 --> 46:14.482
You know what they say.
If you can't beat them,
join them.

46:14.482 --> 46:17.034
What James is doing
is perfectly legal.

46:17.034 --> 46:19.689
He's gonna line us up
on coordinates with Sean here.

46:21.000 --> 46:23.965
Hopefully the paystreak
extends all the way over here.

46:24.586 --> 46:26.241
We're getting closer.

46:27.379 --> 46:29.896
<i>Almost in line
with the CR now.</i>

46:31.172 --> 46:32.793
<i>We're gonna try...</i>

46:32.793 --> 46:33.931
All right.

46:33.931 --> 46:35.068
Can we try it here?

46:36.241 --> 46:40.000
<i>I really need it.
Please pretty please.</i>

46:40.000 --> 46:41.103
Hopefully we're on some gold.

46:41.103 --> 46:44.137
Oh... Can't be any worse
than the last find.

46:44.137 --> 46:45.310
I know

46:45.310 --> 46:46.965
I didn't see.
I saw two flakes.

46:46.965 --> 46:49.310
I saw a couple of specks,
but that was it.

46:49.310 --> 46:51.551
I had to re-pan it twice
to make sure I wasn't...

46:51.551 --> 46:53.586
Just to make sure, yeah.

46:59.241 --> 47:00.896
That felt like something.

47:03.827 --> 47:04.931
Oh, yeah.

47:04.931 --> 47:07.103
Maybe I'm getting
into something now.

47:12.896 --> 47:14.137
Wow.

47:34.413 --> 47:36.137
Was there a color?

47:41.896 --> 47:43.448
<i>Make that gold.</i>

47:45.827 --> 47:48.517
So yeah, James was right
about not going out earlier,

47:48.517 --> 47:50.344
and now he just got us
on the gold.

47:53.000 --> 47:54.896
So I'm gonna let him
do his thing.

47:54.896 --> 47:57.931
Let's put gold in the box
and finally make some money.

48:00.827 --> 48:02.275
<i>Oh, yeah. Of course.</i>

48:06.344 --> 48:08.206
I guess we're in it.

48:08.206 --> 48:10.172
Nice good coarse gold.

48:12.689 --> 48:14.172
Hell yeah.

48:25.931 --> 48:27.413
<i>Ten miles east.</i>

48:32.310 --> 48:34.965
<i>Okay, Gary,
how does the bottom look?</i>

48:36.206 --> 48:38.655
You know what?

48:38.655 --> 48:41.344
I'm looking right here,
and this looks like
it's been worked.

48:42.655 --> 48:45.551
Yeah, it's all been worked.

48:47.275 --> 48:51.551
<i>Vernon Adkinson
is finding his easy
gold sweet spot</i>

48:51.551 --> 48:52.965
<i>is not so easy.</i>

48:54.310 --> 48:58.034
<i>We're on
top of our old holes.
Our winter hole.</i>

48:58.034 --> 49:01.137
Yeah. These are
the coordinates I gave you
for winter.

49:02.896 --> 49:04.379
This exact spot.

49:07.310 --> 49:08.310
<i>Yeah, that's right,
this is where
we worked in the winter.</i>

49:08.310 --> 49:10.310
Okay.

49:10.310 --> 49:12.241
Crap. That sucks.

49:14.103 --> 49:17.206
<i>Maybe I jinxed myself
by calling that's easy gold,</i>

49:17.206 --> 49:20.310
because so far
it's been nothing
but a pain in the ass

49:20.310 --> 49:21.689
trying to get back on it.

49:21.689 --> 49:23.620
<i>The first spot was all sand.</i>

49:23.620 --> 49:27.000
<i>Now we're
on top of a spot that we
cleared out over the winter.</i>

49:27.000 --> 49:29.275
<i>These currents
keep knocking us to hell</i>

49:29.275 --> 49:32.586
<i>and we can't get smack dab
on the coordinates.</i>

49:32.586 --> 49:34.482
Honestly,
it's just not working.

49:35.517 --> 49:38.758
I think we're done, Gary.

49:38.758 --> 49:41.689
We're gonna pull out
and come back

49:41.689 --> 49:43.241
and give it another shot tomorrow.

49:44.827 --> 49:45.965
<i>All right.</i>

49:58.655 --> 50:01.275
It looks like
the anchor line is wrapped
around the hose.

50:03.206 --> 50:04.689
<i>How in the hell
did the hose</i>

50:04.689 --> 50:07.241
<i>get behind the anchor line
like that?</i>

50:07.241 --> 50:11.655
Okay, Bryan,
I'm gonna leave you
down here to monitor him.

50:11.655 --> 50:13.413
I'm going
to start up the engine.

50:13.413 --> 50:17.931
And I'll just
very slowly ahead
on it towards the anchor.

50:23.241 --> 50:27.172
One thing after another,
now the anchor line
has caught up around the hose.

50:27.172 --> 50:30.000
So, now we've got to get it
untwisted and back up.

50:30.896 --> 50:32.655
It's The Gong Show today.

50:40.724 --> 50:42.379
No. I am [bleep].

50:51.517 --> 50:52.793
He's got it.

51:00.931 --> 51:03.620
All right. Pull it up.

51:03.620 --> 51:06.413
Just side off,
don't bust the nuts.

51:06.413 --> 51:09.620
This is one of those days
you just want to forget.

51:09.620 --> 51:11.758
<i>We'll head back to shore,
lick our wounds</i>

51:11.758 --> 51:14.034
and see if we scared up
any gold at all.

51:22.000 --> 51:23.517
It's one of
those days, I know.

51:26.793 --> 51:28.724
I've got to say,
everybody performed

51:28.724 --> 51:31.931
about as well
as could be expected
under the circumstances.

51:32.620 --> 51:33.896
What?

51:34.965 --> 51:37.827
No [bleep] way
would I allow the

51:37.827 --> 51:41.137
that I've seen here today
on my boat.

51:41.137 --> 51:45.862
I do not dive in bubble gum
operations like this.

51:45.862 --> 51:48.620
And don't get me wrong,
I like Vernon.

51:49.241 --> 51:51.827
I like 'em all.

51:51.827 --> 51:56.344
They have a [bleep] up way
of doing things.

51:56.344 --> 52:00.241
Well, in any event,
it's obvious

52:00.241 --> 52:02.482
that there's no way
I can stay on this one,

52:02.482 --> 52:08.655
because somebody on this
boat is going to die,

52:08.655 --> 52:12.000
that somebody hasn't already,

52:12.000 --> 52:14.965
is only by the grace
of whatever God exists.

52:14.965 --> 52:17.896
In any event, I'm not gonna
make any money on this boat.

52:17.896 --> 52:21.758
And if I can't make any money,
I can't stay here.

52:21.758 --> 52:26.344
I'm gonna have to seriously
consider buying another
damn ticket and going home.

52:26.344 --> 52:31.206
So if I can't generate
a paycheck, I can't stay.

52:31.206 --> 52:33.931
And I dearly want to,
because I'm telling you,

52:34.793 --> 52:36.448
there's gold here.

52:36.448 --> 52:38.965
With the right operation,
there's gold here.

52:57.655 --> 52:59.068
Okay.

53:11.793 --> 53:13.379
<i>On Claim 14.</i>

53:13.379 --> 53:16.448
<i>Mother Nature
may be putting an early kibosh</i>

53:16.448 --> 53:18.758
<i>on Jane's first day
of gold mining.</i>

53:29.241 --> 53:30.551
Safety first.

53:32.758 --> 53:35.310
It's all fun and games
until somebody loses an eye.

53:35.310 --> 53:38.137
<i>You'll be having a great day
out here and beautiful weather</i>

53:38.137 --> 53:39.793
<i>and then
the weather God decides</i>

53:39.793 --> 53:43.000
to throw it all at you

53:43.000 --> 53:45.965
and you've got to roll out
as quickly as possible
before somebody gets hurt.

53:45.965 --> 53:47.896
That's how gold mining works.

53:50.310 --> 53:51.413
Yeah, okay.

53:56.275 --> 53:57.551
Yeah.

53:59.310 --> 54:01.379
We're gonna have you
idle down and come up.

54:04.862 --> 54:06.206
<i>Yes. Copy that.</i>

54:14.137 --> 54:16.068
Yeah, it's clearly
getting worse.

54:28.275 --> 54:30.068
Oh, my God.
You had two of 'em.

54:32.758 --> 54:36.172
Ooh. I'll add them
to the collection.

54:36.172 --> 54:37.724
Oh, my god.

54:37.724 --> 54:39.206
Look at this.

54:39.206 --> 54:41.379
I don't want the wind
to blow them.

54:41.379 --> 54:42.586
First day here.

54:42.586 --> 54:44.034
Pretty awesome day.

54:44.034 --> 54:46.206
The weather
is coming up, obviously,

54:46.206 --> 54:49.379
which can make it, you know,
horrible out here and unsafe.

54:49.379 --> 54:50.689
So we're going in.

55:14.862 --> 55:16.689
<i>That's a lot of gold
in the sluice box.</i>

55:17.413 --> 55:19.000
<i>Better take my temperature.</i>

55:19.000 --> 55:22.068
I got a fever, gold fever.

55:30.758 --> 55:32.379
<i>Back out
on Tomcod.</i>

55:40.620 --> 55:41.724
See it?

55:43.448 --> 55:44.758
Better,
we're getting better.

55:44.758 --> 55:45.862
We're getting down there.

55:45.862 --> 55:46.965
Yeah,
we're getting better.

55:46.965 --> 55:48.379
Yep.

55:48.379 --> 55:49.586
Thank God.

55:51.655 --> 55:55.551
<i>I'm like the same line
as the Rose.</i>

55:55.551 --> 55:58.655
<i>So we'll try and stay
on the same course.</i>

55:58.655 --> 56:01.862
As we're mining,
the gold keeps looking
better and better.

56:06.413 --> 56:08.620
That's big rock.

56:08.620 --> 56:11.068
This ground is
just ridiculously hard,

56:11.068 --> 56:14.310
super rocky,
but great pay.

56:16.310 --> 56:19.517
But the ground is brutal
and it's pushing
our old excavator

56:19.517 --> 56:20.655
to the limits.

56:22.137 --> 56:25.793
Old Betsy, you know,
she's getting tired,

56:25.793 --> 56:27.862
doesn't quite have
the digging power.

56:28.931 --> 56:30.965
I think
she is just old [bleep].

56:30.965 --> 56:36.241
Yeah, no horsepower,
dull teeth,
super hard grounds.

56:36.241 --> 56:38.896
<i>That's just
a recipe for disaster.</i>

56:40.931 --> 56:43.758
<i>So basically, I know
this excavator
is on life support,</i>

56:43.758 --> 56:46.655
<i>but I have another one,
the Volvo,
and it's way better,</i>

56:46.655 --> 56:49.068
<i>but it's still being prepped
in the harbor</i>

56:49.068 --> 56:52.172
<i>and it won't be ready
for a couple of days.</i>

56:52.172 --> 56:57.379
So, I need this girl to hold
on a little bit longer
for daddy, please.

56:58.655 --> 57:00.310
It's crazy.
That's all we need.

57:00.310 --> 57:02.482
We just need time
on [bleep] water.

57:04.103 --> 57:09.827
There we go baby,
treat her nice. I love you.

57:09.827 --> 57:11.137
Give me the gold.

57:12.206 --> 57:13.586
Hang in there.

57:20.103 --> 57:21.827
Jeez, you hear that?

57:21.827 --> 57:22.965
Yeah.

57:34.310 --> 57:35.724
Oh, what just happened?

57:35.724 --> 57:37.448
<i>I think we just broke
the excavator.</i>

57:38.827 --> 57:39.896
Did it break?

57:39.896 --> 57:41.517
Where am I leaking?

57:42.482 --> 57:44.206
Where am I leaking?

57:45.379 --> 57:46.586
I smell it.

57:49.655 --> 57:50.793
We're checking it out.

57:50.793 --> 57:52.482
There might be a problem
with the excavator,

57:52.482 --> 57:53.931
which I hope
to God there isn't.

57:59.448 --> 58:00.724
Is it bad?

58:24.655 --> 58:26.172
Get us out of here.

58:26.172 --> 58:28.000
Get back to the dock.

58:28.000 --> 58:30.827
This machine's done
for the season.

58:30.827 --> 58:34.482
We should have had the ex--
the other excavator
on the deck right now.

58:36.034 --> 58:37.172
Spud up.

58:39.827 --> 58:41.551
This isn't a minor
setback, dude.

58:41.551 --> 58:42.896
This is a catastrophe.

58:42.896 --> 58:45.034
We've been waiting
this whole [bleep] time
for good weather,

58:45.034 --> 58:46.310
and finally we make it.

58:46.310 --> 58:49.965
And now the hydraulic
oil cooler is cracked,

58:49.965 --> 58:51.862
and it just sucks.

58:51.862 --> 58:55.482
I'm trying not to yell
and scream
I am in a bad mood now.

58:58.344 --> 58:59.517
We're gonna go in.

58:59.517 --> 59:02.724
We're gonna rip this
excavator dinosaur

59:02.724 --> 59:04.000
off the deck.

59:04.000 --> 59:05.793
We're gonna put the Volvo
on here,

59:05.793 --> 59:09.034
which all the way around
is a better machine
if it runs.

59:11.103 --> 59:13.068
<i>After 20 something
thousand dollars</i>

59:13.068 --> 59:15.275
<i>invested in the piece of
it better [bleep] run.</i>

59:19.000 --> 59:21.172
<i>Every day as an owner
of an excavator barge,</i>

59:21.172 --> 59:22.965
<i>I learn something new.</i>

59:22.965 --> 59:25.310
Today, I'm learning,
I really don't know
that much

59:25.310 --> 59:27.310
about running
an excavator barge.

59:27.310 --> 59:29.275
I'm constantly getting
my ass kicked,

59:29.275 --> 59:31.586
<i>but all I can do
is keep learning these lessons</i>

59:31.586 --> 59:33.827
and try to keep
this operation alive.

59:36.310 --> 59:38.586
I knew something bad
was gonna happen today.

59:47.827 --> 59:48.965
<i>In Nome Harbor.</i>

59:52.758 --> 59:54.965
Here we are
on a big adventure.

59:54.965 --> 59:58.379
First day out with the Reaper,
the new Reaper.

59:58.379 --> 1:00:01.137
Andy's gonna go down
and make us rich.

1:00:02.827 --> 1:00:05.620
The morale's high
with crew cause Kris
isn't here.

1:00:06.310 --> 1:00:07.896
It's actually really peaceful.

1:00:07.896 --> 1:00:09.965
We're going out here,
we're gonna make it work today

1:00:09.965 --> 1:00:13.758
and have a good, peaceful,
quiet day, that'd be nice.

1:00:13.758 --> 1:00:16.965
<i>After addressing
the captain's fixes,</i>

1:00:16.965 --> 1:00:20.448
<i>the new and improved Reaper
sets off on her maiden voyage.</i>

1:00:21.827 --> 1:00:23.103
This boat is ready to go now.

1:00:23.103 --> 1:00:25.827
He shouldn't have to
mess with it
for the next few years.

1:00:30.448 --> 1:00:32.827
<i>So Captain
bitched his little ass off,</i>

1:00:32.827 --> 1:00:34.758
<i>how dad and I
prepped the Reaper.</i>

1:00:34.758 --> 1:00:36.689
So we did everything
he said to do.

1:00:36.689 --> 1:00:39.793
So hopefully we'll get
some gold in the box
unlike, you know, who.

1:00:40.620 --> 1:00:42.206
See you guys later.

1:00:42.206 --> 1:00:43.379
Look there it is.

1:00:43.379 --> 1:00:45.137
You want to see
what a waste of money
looks like?

1:00:45.137 --> 1:00:47.379
Just cast your eyes
on that [bleep] bucket.

1:00:49.310 --> 1:00:52.103
They're all standing around,
five crew members,

1:00:52.103 --> 1:00:53.379
all waiting to get paid.

1:00:53.379 --> 1:00:54.931
No one's working.

1:00:54.931 --> 1:00:57.827
Wow. There's the captain himself.

1:00:59.000 --> 1:01:01.000
You look good at the harbor.

1:01:03.068 --> 1:01:05.896
Thanks. See you later captain.

1:01:05.896 --> 1:01:07.517
Call us.

1:01:07.517 --> 1:01:09.586
We'll be out making gold.

1:01:09.586 --> 1:01:11.068
<i>And now
they're working hard,</i>

1:01:11.068 --> 1:01:13.034
<i>cause he looks embarrassed
because we're on the water.</i>

1:01:13.034 --> 1:01:14.206
Now I'm on the water.

1:01:14.206 --> 1:01:16.000
Yeah. Now he's got
a lot to live up to.

1:01:16.000 --> 1:01:18.586
Oh, yeah, now
he'll [bleep] Damn,
he is on the water now.

1:01:18.586 --> 1:01:19.689
Hurry up, guys.

1:01:19.689 --> 1:01:21.137
Oh, dude,
my clean out.

1:01:21.137 --> 1:01:22.758
I'll beat them every time.

1:01:22.758 --> 1:01:23.965
Let's do it.

1:01:27.517 --> 1:01:31.689
Line me up with that
buoy right where
that is right there,

1:01:31.689 --> 1:01:33.862
a little orange buoy.

1:01:33.862 --> 1:01:35.137
That's one of Kris'.

1:01:44.689 --> 1:01:45.793
There you go.

1:01:45.793 --> 1:01:47.137
Oh yeah.

1:01:49.655 --> 1:01:50.724
How's it looking?

1:02:10.344 --> 1:02:12.517
So I did everything
my brother said to do.

1:02:12.517 --> 1:02:13.965
Hooked up everything
the way he wanted.

1:02:13.965 --> 1:02:15.620
Now, my boat's
front heavy

1:02:15.620 --> 1:02:17.310
and basically
under the water.

1:02:17.310 --> 1:02:18.620
Hey, don't blame me.

1:02:18.620 --> 1:02:20.931
Hopefully his other ideas
didn't screw up things
too bad.

1:02:29.793 --> 1:02:31.034
Let's go.

1:02:48.758 --> 1:02:51.068
<i>The pressure is good,
120 pounds.</i>

1:02:52.586 --> 1:02:54.275
All right.

1:02:54.275 --> 1:02:57.172
So far, so good.
Knock on wood.

1:02:57.172 --> 1:03:00.896
The box is running,
everything's running
all right.

1:03:00.896 --> 1:03:04.000
Hopefully Andy
puts us on big gold
right now.

1:03:04.000 --> 1:03:05.896
Everything's working good
up here.

1:03:07.586 --> 1:03:09.344
How's the visibility Andy?

1:03:09.344 --> 1:03:11.724
Visibility sucks,
but I can see.

1:03:14.965 --> 1:03:16.896
What's the bottom
looking like?

1:03:20.896 --> 1:03:23.000
What's that mean?
No cobble?

1:03:34.482 --> 1:03:36.000
<i>My brother is [bleep]</i>

1:03:42.827 --> 1:03:44.655
<i>What's the matter, Andy.</i>

1:03:44.655 --> 1:03:46.103
You okay?

1:04:09.655 --> 1:04:12.034
Okay, I'm gonna get
the hell out of here.

1:04:24.896 --> 1:04:26.482
So what do you
want to do?

1:04:29.689 --> 1:04:31.448
<i>This is complete garbage.</i>

1:04:31.448 --> 1:04:33.241
<i>The water heater is crap.</i>

1:04:33.241 --> 1:04:35.000
<i>The front of our boat
is dipping</i>

1:04:35.000 --> 1:04:36.965
<i>and what the hell
is my brother with his buoys?</i>

1:04:36.965 --> 1:04:38.172
I don't understand that.

1:04:38.172 --> 1:04:40.275
It's a bunch of rocks, dude.
What is he, stoned?

1:04:41.793 --> 1:04:43.172
- What the hoses?
- Yeah.

1:04:43.172 --> 1:04:44.310
Too much float on it?

1:04:44.310 --> 1:04:45.448
Yep.

1:04:45.448 --> 1:04:46.586
So we gotta cut the float?

1:04:46.586 --> 1:04:48.862
That's Kris' idea, two floats
on each side. Too light,

1:04:50.000 --> 1:04:52.482
What the
he keeps
everything up.

1:04:56.620 --> 1:04:57.896
It was good the way it was.

1:04:57.896 --> 1:05:00.034
That's the last time
we listened to Kris.

1:05:00.034 --> 1:05:03.137
We can't listen
to a failed captain
on a failed boat.

1:05:05.482 --> 1:05:08.517
<i>We should have probably named
this boat the SS Kris Kelly.</i>

1:05:12.000 --> 1:05:13.172
<i>On the Tomcod.</i>

1:05:22.827 --> 1:05:25.379
<i>Feels good to be back
out on the sea,</i>

1:05:25.379 --> 1:05:27.931
<i>digging, making money.</i>

1:05:27.931 --> 1:05:29.482
<i>The Myrtle's
digging deep</i>

1:05:30.965 --> 1:05:34.034
<i>and the captain is digging
what he's seeing.</i>

1:05:34.034 --> 1:05:38.068
I mean, the Myrtle's
been sitting here all lonely

1:05:38.068 --> 1:05:43.068
and sad hasn't been running,
but now she's happy,
back up and running.

1:05:43.068 --> 1:05:44.517
Got dirt going through
the box.

1:05:48.689 --> 1:05:50.344
<i>Materials looking really good.</i>

1:05:53.586 --> 1:05:54.931
Lots of colors.

1:05:56.655 --> 1:05:58.655
Sometimes you get frustrated.

1:05:58.655 --> 1:06:00.482
Sometimes you don't get
anything else.

1:06:00.482 --> 1:06:03.034
There's days
I want to quit and give up.

1:06:03.655 --> 1:06:05.517
<i>How come I don't quit?</i>

1:06:05.517 --> 1:06:07.758
We got way too much
on the line.

1:06:08.310 --> 1:06:09.827
Way too much money

1:06:09.827 --> 1:06:12.275
and way too many guys
count on me.

1:06:12.275 --> 1:06:14.103
So they can feed their family

1:06:14.103 --> 1:06:16.620
and now my son
is working for me.

1:06:16.620 --> 1:06:17.896
He's got a new kid.

1:06:19.068 --> 1:06:20.586
<i>I'm a provider.</i>

1:06:20.586 --> 1:06:23.068
<i>Only way to provide
is to find gold.</i>

1:06:25.275 --> 1:06:28.103
<i>My family, that's what
I'm doing this for.</i>

1:06:28.103 --> 1:06:30.241
That's why I push it 24/7.

1:06:30.241 --> 1:06:32.068
They're all counting on me.

1:06:33.517 --> 1:06:35.310
<i>Hopefully with this
deep ground,</i>

1:06:35.310 --> 1:06:37.206
I'm gonna come
through big for 'em.

1:06:43.827 --> 1:06:45.137
Night shift's here.

1:06:46.551 --> 1:06:48.862
Those boys are going
to make some money tonight.

1:06:50.724 --> 1:06:52.965
This spot is hot.

1:06:52.965 --> 1:06:55.413
I want to keep the Myrtle
on it digging
around the clock.

1:06:55.413 --> 1:06:57.172
I'm going
to keep that gold coming.

1:06:57.172 --> 1:06:58.793
We've been down
for almost a week,

1:06:58.793 --> 1:07:01.206
so we got to make up
for lost time.

1:07:01.206 --> 1:07:03.689
Oh, you got to rub
the good luck belly.

1:07:04.068 --> 1:07:05.931
Yeah.

1:07:05.931 --> 1:07:08.862
We got these guys
all ready to rock and roll.

1:07:08.862 --> 1:07:11.448
It never stopped,
but, hey, that's the gig.

1:07:11.448 --> 1:07:13.275
That's the life we choose.

1:07:13.275 --> 1:07:15.000
I wouldn't have it
any other way.

1:07:16.379 --> 1:07:17.931
<i>Need to pile up some gold.</i>

1:07:30.896 --> 1:07:32.241
<i>Well, we're gonna clean gold.</i>

1:07:32.241 --> 1:07:34.000
I don't know
how to clean gold,
but I'm about to find out.

1:07:34.000 --> 1:07:35.413
I have
no idea what to do,

1:07:35.413 --> 1:07:37.137
but I'm happy
to be of assistance.

1:07:37.137 --> 1:07:39.965
<i>With only one day
of gold mining under her belt.</i>

1:07:39.965 --> 1:07:42.482
<i>The fronts moved
in quicker than we thought,</i>

1:07:42.482 --> 1:07:43.724
you got cut off early,

1:07:43.724 --> 1:07:46.551
but let's get the material
out to the cleanup

1:07:46.551 --> 1:07:48.310
and start running it.

1:07:48.310 --> 1:07:51.000
<i>Emily's apprentice,
Jane Kilcher,</i>

1:07:51.000 --> 1:07:54.379
<i>is about to experience
the golden rewards.</i>

1:07:54.379 --> 1:07:58.103
<i>Jane flew in
and she got right
into the gold gig right away.</i>

1:07:58.103 --> 1:07:59.448
Like, wasted no time.

1:07:59.448 --> 1:08:01.482
Just basically like
stepped off the plane

1:08:01.482 --> 1:08:03.862
<i>and onto the boat and now
we're doing a cleanup today.</i>

1:08:03.862 --> 1:08:06.655
So she's getting the full
gold miner experience.

1:08:06.655 --> 1:08:08.620
Every little speck matters, so.

1:08:08.620 --> 1:08:10.103
Apparently.

1:08:10.103 --> 1:08:13.896
Yeah, we just
like clean it as best
as possible as we can.

1:08:13.896 --> 1:08:16.862
I have shown Jane every step
of the cleanup process,

1:08:16.862 --> 1:08:19.965
we take the screens out,
we rinse the screens.

1:08:19.965 --> 1:08:22.000
<i>That's the shiniest part there.</i>

1:08:22.000 --> 1:08:23.931
It's what we call it
the yum yums.

1:08:23.931 --> 1:08:25.655
That's just nice pile

1:08:25.655 --> 1:08:28.413
and then we take
the carpet out, rinse it.

1:08:31.068 --> 1:08:32.275
How does this look?

1:08:32.275 --> 1:08:33.413
It looks pretty clean.

1:08:33.413 --> 1:08:34.931
Okay.

1:08:34.931 --> 1:08:37.793
<i>Yeah, we like scraped the dirt
from the corners of the box.</i>

1:08:37.793 --> 1:08:40.172
<i>There's little specks
in there,
and they add up fast.</i>

1:08:40.172 --> 1:08:41.793
Leave no gold behind.

1:08:52.758 --> 1:08:56.310
<i>Yeah. This part
of the cleanup is over.</i>

1:08:56.310 --> 1:08:58.206
<i>Total mancave
in here.</i>

1:08:58.206 --> 1:08:59.827
<i>All that glitters is not gold.</i>

1:09:01.448 --> 1:09:03.620
I'm going to classify
the concentrates

1:09:03.620 --> 1:09:07.413
and then run it through
our gold cube
and then after that,

1:09:07.413 --> 1:09:11.862
we've got to pan
our pants off.
Dry it and weight it.

1:09:11.862 --> 1:09:15.068
I am overwhelmed
with excitement.

1:09:16.758 --> 1:09:18.344
God, it's like gold
in every scoop.

1:09:19.379 --> 1:09:22.931
Jane is a gold cube expert
over here.

1:09:22.931 --> 1:09:25.000
Very rewarding.
It can go a little late.

1:09:25.862 --> 1:09:27.965
We have panned
this gold out

1:09:27.965 --> 1:09:30.034
and it is ready
to be dried and weighed.

1:09:30.034 --> 1:09:31.172
It's going to go
on the scale

1:09:31.172 --> 1:09:32.896
and then we're either going
to cry or celebrate.

1:09:32.896 --> 1:09:34.206
Maybe
a little bit of both.

1:09:35.413 --> 1:09:37.206
<i>It's really cool
to see all this gold.</i>

1:09:37.206 --> 1:09:39.310
<i>I mean, this is
what it's all for.</i>

1:09:39.310 --> 1:09:41.551
<i>People go crazy
over this stuff.</i>

1:09:41.551 --> 1:09:43.551
<i>And now we're gonna go
weigh the gold.</i>

1:09:43.551 --> 1:09:44.862
That's the final step.

1:09:48.206 --> 1:09:50.034
The gold is cooked, it's dry.

1:09:50.034 --> 1:09:51.862
Now it's time to show Jane
the really fun part.

1:09:53.000 --> 1:09:54.310
Alright everybody.

1:09:54.310 --> 1:09:56.206
We are weighing some gold.

1:09:58.344 --> 1:10:01.000
One, two...

1:10:01.000 --> 1:10:02.379
It's so pretty.

1:10:02.379 --> 1:10:04.310
Three...

1:10:04.310 --> 1:10:06.068
Six, seven.

1:10:07.172 --> 1:10:12.758
Oh, over ten,
11, 15, 16...

1:10:15.724 --> 1:10:17.068
Almost 20 ounces though.

1:10:17.068 --> 1:10:18.448
Almost 20.

1:10:18.448 --> 1:10:20.275
<i>19.1 ounces.</i>

1:10:20.275 --> 1:10:22.793
It's worth over $34,000.

1:10:22.793 --> 1:10:25.551
Hey, that's pretty good.

1:10:25.551 --> 1:10:27.586
We were just moving
into better stuff

1:10:27.586 --> 1:10:29.137
when the weather got bad so...

1:10:29.137 --> 1:10:31.275
and I'm happy we got
this clean up in

1:10:31.275 --> 1:10:34.344
and as soon
as the Bering Sea decides
to calm down and take a nap,

1:10:34.344 --> 1:10:35.965
we'll be ready
to hit it again.

1:10:35.965 --> 1:10:37.965
But thanks
for being here Jane.

1:10:37.965 --> 1:10:39.379
Oh, it's awesome.

1:10:39.379 --> 1:10:41.517
Summer just continues
to go really well.

1:10:41.517 --> 1:10:43.551
Even though
we got kicked off for weather,

1:10:43.551 --> 1:10:45.241
we still have a good number.

1:10:45.241 --> 1:10:46.965
I'm feeling really good
about where we are.

1:10:46.965 --> 1:10:48.793
I've got my buddy
to help manage,

1:10:48.793 --> 1:10:52.379
full slate of divers and so
we'll be running a big team

1:10:52.379 --> 1:10:55.068
and we should see
a big uptick in numbers.

1:10:55.068 --> 1:10:56.517
All right. Well, awesome.

1:10:56.517 --> 1:10:58.862
Let's get out of here.
Go get some food.

1:10:58.862 --> 1:11:02.793
Few things I learned
so far is that nothing
has changed in 100 years.

1:11:02.793 --> 1:11:05.517
And everybody that's out
here mining is crazy.

1:11:07.758 --> 1:11:10.310
Not the good kind of crazy
like the crazy, crazy.

1:11:10.310 --> 1:11:11.931
<i>Three miles north.</i>

1:11:25.793 --> 1:11:27.793
You guys got that gold
cleaned yet.

1:11:29.896 --> 1:11:31.896
You can see, we got good gold.

1:11:31.896 --> 1:11:33.275
Nice job, guys.

1:11:33.275 --> 1:11:35.862
Kicking ass. Doing well.
Doing well.

1:11:35.862 --> 1:11:37.000
<i>After the night crew</i>

1:11:37.000 --> 1:11:39.517
<i>added to Mr. Gold's tally
in the box,</i>

1:11:39.517 --> 1:11:41.310
<i>it's time to put it
on the scale</i>

1:11:41.310 --> 1:11:45.000
<i>and see if big waves
provided big dividends.</i>

1:11:45.000 --> 1:11:48.137
You need
a little morale booster.

1:11:48.137 --> 1:11:53.344
Inland mines go on strong,
but the gold on the water
just hasn't been there.

1:11:53.344 --> 1:11:55.206
Starting to get
a little nervous.

1:11:55.206 --> 1:11:57.896
Dave Young,
it's a big investment for him.

1:11:57.896 --> 1:11:59.275
He's nervous too.

1:11:59.275 --> 1:12:01.344
He's starting
to breathe down my neck.

1:12:01.344 --> 1:12:04.206
Hopefully, with this
opportunity to get
to deeper ground,

1:12:04.206 --> 1:12:07.206
we're gonna drive right
towards our goal
of 3,000 ounces.

1:12:09.068 --> 1:12:11.655
Here we go.
Let's see what we got.

1:12:11.655 --> 1:12:14.000
Had a good day of mining.

1:12:14.000 --> 1:12:15.655
Everything was working.

1:12:18.034 --> 1:12:21.655
Come on,
let's hit triple digits,

1:12:21.655 --> 1:12:26.206
40, 50, 60, 70.

1:12:28.310 --> 1:12:29.896
Come on.

1:12:29.896 --> 1:12:32.413
Oh, man,

1:12:33.896 --> 1:12:36.275
85.5.

1:12:38.000 --> 1:12:40.241
Man, I was hoping to hit
triple digits.

1:12:41.620 --> 1:12:45.931
<i>85.5 ounces
is worth over 150 grand,</i>

1:12:45.931 --> 1:12:50.000
<i>but Shawn is still
facing a long road
to get to 3,000 ounces.</i>

1:12:50.931 --> 1:12:54.586
Eight five ounces
should have been 160.

1:12:56.000 --> 1:12:57.068
Is this a good cleanup?

1:12:57.068 --> 1:13:00.344
Yeah, but at this point,
is it what I need?

1:13:00.344 --> 1:13:02.586
No, it ain't going to cut it.

1:13:02.586 --> 1:13:05.206
We lost a bunch of
time mining.

1:13:05.206 --> 1:13:08.206
With the soft start
and the days off the water,

1:13:08.206 --> 1:13:11.103
we got to have bofu numbers
from here on out.

1:13:11.103 --> 1:13:13.862
Get back out on the water.
Get back to mining.

1:13:17.000 --> 1:13:18.103
<i>Back in town.</i>

1:13:23.517 --> 1:13:25.241
So, how's it looking
at cleanup.

1:13:25.241 --> 1:13:27.310
You know,
there's not a lot of hours.

1:13:27.310 --> 1:13:30.034
So there really wasn't a lot
of material to even run it.

1:13:30.034 --> 1:13:32.862
So I don't expect to see
a lot of gold, but right now,

1:13:32.862 --> 1:13:34.689
a nice paycheck
would be great.

1:13:36.379 --> 1:13:38.758
<i>After a day
filled with struggles,</i>

1:13:38.758 --> 1:13:42.172
<i>Kris Kelly is hoping
for a pleasant surprise
on the scales.</i>

1:13:43.275 --> 1:13:45.172
Please let there be
a lot of gold.

1:13:46.517 --> 1:13:51.172
Oh, we've got some
nice little pickers going on.

1:13:51.172 --> 1:13:55.103
I know it looks like
a lot of gold, but it's not.

1:13:55.103 --> 1:13:57.655
I don't want to start thinking
that I made a bad investment,

1:13:57.655 --> 1:13:58.965
but it's excavator problems.

1:13:58.965 --> 1:14:01.206
We're not having a problem
with gold recovery.

1:14:01.206 --> 1:14:03.586
Everything's working good,
it's [bleep] excavators.

1:14:03.586 --> 1:14:06.517
So at least
I'm getting gold.

1:14:06.517 --> 1:14:07.827
And I'm not mad.

1:14:07.827 --> 1:14:10.655
At least everybody's getting
a paycheck.

1:14:10.655 --> 1:14:13.034
But I would like
a lot of gold.
I'm not gonna lie to you.

1:14:13.034 --> 1:14:14.482
I would like so much gold.

1:14:14.482 --> 1:14:16.655
<i>I don't know
what to do with all my gold.</i>

1:14:16.655 --> 1:14:19.551
<i>This is maddening.
I have a huge payment due.</i>

1:14:19.551 --> 1:14:21.241
<i>I know where the gold is,</i>

1:14:21.241 --> 1:14:24.034
<i>but getting it is
becoming a huge problem.</i>

1:14:24.034 --> 1:14:26.655
It could be better,
let me tell you.
It could be a lot better.

1:14:26.655 --> 1:14:28.862
I wish I could just go
down there and get it myself.

1:14:28.862 --> 1:14:30.241
But it doesn't work that way.

1:14:30.758 --> 1:14:32.793
<i>Come on.</i>

1:14:32.793 --> 1:14:35.620
<i>So I got a skeleton crew
working on the new excavator,</i>

1:14:35.620 --> 1:14:37.000
trying to get it up
and running

1:14:37.000 --> 1:14:40.586
ASAP while we weigh
what we got, ASAFP.

1:14:49.068 --> 1:14:50.586
Five,

1:14:51.344 --> 1:14:55.827
6.29.

1:14:55.827 --> 1:15:00.206
<i>6.29 ounces
is worth over $11,000,</i>

1:15:00.206 --> 1:15:04.620
<i>but with the bills piling up,
it's far from what Kris needs.</i>

1:15:04.620 --> 1:15:07.551
<i>Right now the Mistress
is not doing
as good as it should.</i>

1:15:07.551 --> 1:15:09.793
I have put a lot of money
into it
and it's real stressful

1:15:09.793 --> 1:15:11.448
and everything going

1:15:11.448 --> 1:15:14.896
If I have that
excavator running,
I'd be making a lot of money

1:15:14.896 --> 1:15:16.241
because this isn't [bleep],

1:15:16.241 --> 1:15:20.517
you know, we should be getting
three times that
on the Reaper.

1:15:20.517 --> 1:15:23.241
This is a sad amount of gold,
but it's proof
we're on the gold.

1:15:23.241 --> 1:15:25.448
We're just not getting it
and further proof,

1:15:25.448 --> 1:15:29.724
we just need the new excavator
ready to go,
like, immediately.

1:15:29.724 --> 1:15:31.620
I want to see that
doubled next time.

1:15:40.206 --> 1:15:43.758
Damn, well,
it's kind of spongy down here.

1:15:43.758 --> 1:15:46.310
Damn right, because you got
a sponge diver standing here.

1:15:46.310 --> 1:15:47.896
Sponge Dave.

1:15:47.896 --> 1:15:51.275
You got the only sponge diver
on the West Coast
standing on this guy's boat.

1:15:51.275 --> 1:15:52.931
I guarantee nobody else.

1:15:52.931 --> 1:15:56.482
It's probably the western
part of the United States
does what I do.

1:15:56.482 --> 1:16:00.689
So, that's why it tends
to stay with me wherever I go.

1:16:03.413 --> 1:16:05.655
They've got
a pet name for you, right?

1:16:05.655 --> 1:16:06.758
What do they call you?

1:16:06.758 --> 1:16:09.172
They call me the naked
sponge diver.

1:16:10.965 --> 1:16:13.482
Yeah, actually, truth is,
I don't actually dive

1:16:13.482 --> 1:16:16.068
for sponge naked,
but as soon as I come up

1:16:16.068 --> 1:16:17.689
because I work alone...

1:16:17.689 --> 1:16:19.758
As soon as I come up
above the waterline,

1:16:19.758 --> 1:16:21.689
as soon as I get back
on my boat,

1:16:21.689 --> 1:16:23.344
every stitch of clothes
comes off

1:16:23.344 --> 1:16:26.172
except a pair of boots,
a bandana and a hat.

1:16:28.724 --> 1:16:32.172
And I got the tunes going,
so I can't hear [bleep].

1:16:32.172 --> 1:16:36.034
I used to run downstairs
and put clothes on,
not anymore.

1:16:36.034 --> 1:16:37.206
I don't dive naked.

1:16:37.206 --> 1:16:39.103
I'm not that
kind of an idiot.

1:16:39.103 --> 1:16:41.862
There is a thread of reasoning
involved in this.

1:16:41.862 --> 1:16:43.103
- I mean...
- Yeah.

1:16:43.103 --> 1:16:44.965
You know, you stay down
there long enough

1:16:44.965 --> 1:16:46.689
with all your assets
hanging out,

1:16:46.689 --> 1:16:49.172
something bound
over a period of years,

1:16:49.172 --> 1:16:50.724
something's bound
to take a nibble.

1:16:50.724 --> 1:16:53.413
Yes sir or take it right off,
one or the other.

1:16:53.413 --> 1:16:54.586
Yes, sir.

1:17:00.827 --> 1:17:03.206
<i>As dawn breaks
on the Bering Sea.</i>

1:17:08.172 --> 1:17:10.068
Dave,
thanks for coming out with us.

1:17:10.068 --> 1:17:11.827
Thank you for letting me
get out.

1:17:11.827 --> 1:17:14.413
After I left y'all,
I thought about this

1:17:14.413 --> 1:17:16.551
and thought about this
and I decided

1:17:16.551 --> 1:17:19.137
there's no point
in me staying.

1:17:19.137 --> 1:17:21.793
All I'm gonna do
is hemorrhage money.

1:17:21.793 --> 1:17:24.344
That's why I went online
and got the cheapest ticket

1:17:24.344 --> 1:17:26.103
I could find,
which is today.

1:17:26.103 --> 1:17:28.172
That was the cheapest one
I could find.

1:17:28.172 --> 1:17:30.862
<i>Oh, Dave,
we hardly knew you,</i>

1:17:30.862 --> 1:17:33.724
<i>but like any good hurricane,
you blew yourself out.</i>

1:17:35.068 --> 1:17:37.620
You know, I cannot stay here
without a paycheck.

1:17:37.620 --> 1:17:40.724
The only reason I didn't leave
was because you graciously,

1:17:40.724 --> 1:17:43.551
out of the kindness
of your heart,

1:17:43.551 --> 1:17:45.379
allowed me to stay
on your boat.

1:17:46.655 --> 1:17:49.965
Dave came here with no leads,
no housing plan,

1:17:49.965 --> 1:17:51.965
just a bag and a dream.

1:17:51.965 --> 1:17:53.655
Pretty ballsy, actually.

1:17:53.655 --> 1:17:56.413
So I let him stay
in an old boat
on the property.

1:17:56.413 --> 1:17:58.000
Hell, there was literally

1:17:58.000 --> 1:18:00.137
no other option than
Nome last night.

1:18:00.137 --> 1:18:01.931
It wasn't exactly the Ritz,

1:18:01.931 --> 1:18:03.862
I'd rate it slightly primitive.

1:18:03.862 --> 1:18:05.689
I hadn't had a shower
since I got here.

1:18:05.689 --> 1:18:07.275
Hadn't brushed my teeth
since I got here.

1:18:07.275 --> 1:18:08.344
No shower.

1:18:08.344 --> 1:18:10.517
I had to...
I'm not even gonna go...

1:18:10.517 --> 1:18:13.206
I'm not even gonna go
into where I had to go
to the bathroom.

1:18:13.206 --> 1:18:14.724
I'm not gonna even go there.

1:18:14.724 --> 1:18:17.103
I literally had to
plastic bag this morning.

1:18:17.103 --> 1:18:18.827
I couldn't make it
to the outhouse.

1:18:18.827 --> 1:18:22.689
I stood in your cabin
with a plastic bag

1:18:22.689 --> 1:18:25.758
underneath my ass
taking a

1:18:25.758 --> 1:18:28.172
and the only reason
that I had toilet paper

1:18:28.172 --> 1:18:30.724
was because you left
a roll there.

1:18:30.724 --> 1:18:32.172
Vernon,
I don't live like that.

1:18:32.172 --> 1:18:34.448
I'm not gonna live like that.

1:18:34.448 --> 1:18:36.241
I don't want you
disappointed in me,

1:18:36.241 --> 1:18:39.103
but there's nothing I can do.

1:18:39.103 --> 1:18:42.482
I appreciate
you coming up here
and checking it out,

1:18:42.482 --> 1:18:45.000
but you haven't really
given it enough time

1:18:45.000 --> 1:18:47.827
to get a fair assessment
of what's going on.

1:18:47.827 --> 1:18:51.310
I do not need any more time
to determine

1:18:51.310 --> 1:18:53.551
it's not going to happen.

1:18:53.551 --> 1:18:56.068
It wouldn't have mattered
if I had stayed another week.

1:18:56.068 --> 1:18:59.000
The situation was not going
to change.

1:18:59.000 --> 1:19:02.379
The circumstances of me
being able to generate

1:19:02.379 --> 1:19:07.137
a paycheck in two weeks
is not going to change.

1:19:07.137 --> 1:19:11.379
It's not going to happen
and I can't stay.

1:19:11.379 --> 1:19:14.344
I understand,
but here's
what it's all about.

1:19:15.379 --> 1:19:19.758
That's about an ounce,
that's g-o-l-d.

1:19:20.862 --> 1:19:23.000
Nine years
and thousands of dollars

1:19:23.000 --> 1:19:26.344
and I finally get to hold
gold in my hand.

1:19:26.344 --> 1:19:28.758
How about that?

1:19:28.758 --> 1:19:32.241
I couldn't let Dave leave
without setting his eyes
on some gold.

1:19:32.241 --> 1:19:34.103
It's the first time
he's ever seen some

1:19:34.103 --> 1:19:35.620
from the Bering Sea.

1:19:35.620 --> 1:19:37.862
The guy instantly
turned into Gollum.

1:19:37.862 --> 1:19:40.827
Yeah.

1:19:40.827 --> 1:19:43.413
It was like he was hanging
on to his precious,

1:19:43.413 --> 1:19:46.000
the one ring to rule them all.

1:19:46.000 --> 1:19:48.758
Gold can have that effect
on people.

1:19:48.758 --> 1:19:51.724
Anyway, about time to get you
to the airport, Dave.

1:19:51.724 --> 1:19:52.862
All right, boss.

1:19:52.862 --> 1:19:55.586
I had a hell of a good time.

1:19:55.586 --> 1:19:58.241
The only way I'm ever
gonna make it here

1:19:58.241 --> 1:20:02.068
is because I'm in command
of my own boat.

1:20:02.068 --> 1:20:07.068
I may as well go home,
regroup, and set up
for coming back next year,

1:20:07.068 --> 1:20:10.034
but under
different circumstances.

1:20:10.034 --> 1:20:11.931
So it's back home to Florida.

1:20:11.931 --> 1:20:13.827
Back home to my sponge boat.

1:20:13.827 --> 1:20:15.448
Back home to sponging.

1:20:17.103 --> 1:20:18.517
Oh, my God.

1:20:20.103 --> 1:20:22.310
I'm heading out to the beach
one more time.

1:20:24.724 --> 1:20:27.413
I swear to God, I think
we still have
a future together.

1:20:27.413 --> 1:20:29.620
I just don't know.

1:20:29.620 --> 1:20:32.586
I just can't stay here
and [bleep] around.

1:20:32.586 --> 1:20:34.344
I've got to be allowed
to go to work.

1:20:37.620 --> 1:20:38.896
I'm gonna miss this place.

1:20:40.931 --> 1:20:44.172
Oh my God,
I can't believe it.

1:20:45.931 --> 1:20:48.413
<i>Nine years it took me
to get back.</i>

1:20:49.793 --> 1:20:51.103
You know, I got to go home.

1:21:01.931 --> 1:21:03.655
<i>It's okay. It's okay.</i>

1:21:03.655 --> 1:21:05.413
<i>I knew I was gonna
get emotional.</i>

1:21:05.413 --> 1:21:06.862
<i>I knew that was gonna happen.</i>

1:21:17.172 --> 1:21:18.724
Later man, take it easy.

1:21:18.724 --> 1:21:20.655
- Take care of yourself.
- Yeah, yeah.
I'll see you next time.

1:21:37.206 --> 1:21:38.448
Okay.

1:21:38.448 --> 1:21:40.103
All right,
we need to make tracks.

1:21:46.103 --> 1:21:47.206
Okay, buddy.

1:21:48.827 --> 1:21:50.620
I am gonna talk to you
again in summer.

1:21:50.620 --> 1:21:51.724
We'll stay in touch.

1:21:51.724 --> 1:21:53.310
- Okay, Dave.
- Thank you so much.

1:21:53.310 --> 1:21:54.793
Yeah. You just have
a good trip home.

1:21:54.793 --> 1:21:56.551
Thank you so very much.

1:21:56.551 --> 1:22:00.000
I just hope I can figure out
how to make this happen.

1:22:00.000 --> 1:22:01.586
- I got to go.
- All right.

1:22:01.586 --> 1:22:02.793
Yeah. Go check in.

1:22:02.793 --> 1:22:04.068
Yep. Yep. Yep.

1:22:07.206 --> 1:22:09.827
He blew in and he blew out.

1:22:09.827 --> 1:22:13.344
Call up down to Florida
and tell them Hurricane Dave
is on the way.

1:22:18.344 --> 1:22:20.965
Don't get down there
and get all those sponges.

1:22:20.965 --> 1:22:22.620
So, sponges beware.

1:22:24.517 --> 1:22:26.206
Adios, Hurricane Dave.

1:22:30.586 --> 1:22:31.965
We've survived that hurricane.

1:22:33.448 --> 1:22:36.517
Don't let it be said that
he mellowed with age.

1:22:36.517 --> 1:22:38.000
He's the same Dave.
