WEBVTT

00:22.457 --> 00:23.806
Hey.

00:23.849 --> 00:26.287
Hey.

00:26.330 --> 00:27.375
Morning.

00:27.418 --> 00:28.854
Morning.

00:28.898 --> 00:31.770
Didn't expect...
last night to-to...

00:31.814 --> 00:35.035
end up like that.

00:35.078 --> 00:37.689
What do you mean,
when you followed me inside?

00:37.733 --> 00:40.301
I don't know, you could've
been asking me to-to get

00:40.344 --> 00:41.650
a spider or something...A spider?

00:41.693 --> 00:43.391
- Or change a lightbulb, I'm tall.
- That's ridiculous.

00:43.434 --> 00:45.306
- Well... uh, yeah.
- That's ridiculous.

00:45.349 --> 00:48.265
Cordi, you know...

00:48.309 --> 00:50.920
- that it's been there between us.
- Yeah.

00:50.963 --> 00:52.400
I just didn't know if...

00:52.443 --> 00:54.837
you thought it was a good idea.

00:54.880 --> 00:56.882
Well...

00:56.926 --> 00:59.146
I'm glad we're here.

00:59.189 --> 01:01.931
And now that we are here,

01:01.974 --> 01:03.802
uh...

01:03.846 --> 01:05.935
what are we?

01:05.978 --> 01:08.024
I'm not trying to put
you on the spot.

01:08.068 --> 01:09.678
- Or-or pressure you.
- Okay, um...

01:09.721 --> 01:12.681
Just I-I need to know what
to say to Augie and-and Stella.

01:12.724 --> 01:14.509
Oh, no, no, no, hold on.

01:14.552 --> 01:17.120
We... mm-mm, I don't,
I don't want to force

01:17.164 --> 01:18.643
any kind of role
on them.

01:18.687 --> 01:21.429
I'm not Em
and I would never ever

01:21.472 --> 01:22.865
try to be ever...I know.

01:22.908 --> 01:24.693
And I'm not Hoyt
and I'm not trying

01:24.736 --> 01:26.390
to be Hoyt-- I-I-I
would lose my job...

01:26.434 --> 01:28.131
You would lose your job.

01:28.175 --> 01:30.046
I know that, Ger, and
the kids, they know that.

01:30.090 --> 01:32.570
I mean, they're more mature
than I-I'd like to accept.

01:32.614 --> 01:35.660
Let me just...
let's just give it a minute.

01:35.704 --> 01:37.749
You know what I mean, just...

01:37.793 --> 01:39.925
Things just changed.

01:39.969 --> 01:41.840
Right, so let's...Right, right.

01:41.884 --> 01:43.886
- Okay.
- Of course.

01:43.929 --> 01:46.149
How about this? Uh...

01:46.193 --> 01:47.846
Let's, um...

01:47.890 --> 01:49.805
let's make a pact.

01:49.848 --> 01:51.502
You and me,
all right?

01:51.546 --> 01:52.982
Okay.
We got to
make a deal.

01:53.025 --> 01:54.984
If we start feeling like...

01:55.027 --> 01:57.334
this is going somewhere
we're not comfortable...

01:57.378 --> 01:58.857
we call each other out.

01:58.901 --> 02:00.642
- Oh.
- We can use a safe word.

02:00.685 --> 02:01.947
- I love that, a safe word.
- Yeah?

02:01.991 --> 02:03.427
- Great, what is it?
- Yeah, safe word, yeah.

02:03.471 --> 02:05.864
Uh...

02:06.604 --> 02:08.954
Dolly."Dolly"?

02:08.998 --> 02:10.739
Dolly, mm-hmm."Dolly," as in Parton?

02:10.782 --> 02:13.872
No, "Dolly," as in her
cloned sheep namesake.

02:13.916 --> 02:15.439
It was all over the news

02:15.483 --> 02:16.788
- when you moved to town.
- Oh, yes!

02:16.832 --> 02:17.920
We geeked out
about it.

02:17.963 --> 02:19.487
- Right! Yes, yes!
- Yes!

02:19.530 --> 02:20.836
Oh, my God!

02:20.879 --> 02:23.360
How did no one else
in our class find

02:23.404 --> 02:26.755
this incredible scientific
advancement fascinating?

02:26.798 --> 02:29.714
- Teenagers are tough. Mm-hmm.
- They are tough.

02:29.758 --> 02:32.717
Hence my hesitation
about telling the kids.

02:32.761 --> 02:35.329
Right?

02:47.602 --> 02:49.343
Hey!

02:49.386 --> 02:51.562
Well, good morning, Cordell.

02:51.606 --> 02:52.781
Morning.

02:52.824 --> 02:54.957
What, you been to war?

02:55.000 --> 02:57.438
Been to something.

02:57.481 --> 02:59.614
Mm-hmm.No.

02:59.657 --> 03:00.919
I just, uh...

03:00.963 --> 03:02.791
Hey, Dad.

03:02.834 --> 03:04.967
Augie, hey.

03:08.275 --> 03:10.320
Butterbean.

03:10.364 --> 03:12.061
Welcome home.

03:12.104 --> 03:13.280
Thanks.

03:14.455 --> 03:15.673
Mm.

03:15.717 --> 03:18.328
Look, i-it's good
that we're all here now.

03:19.590 --> 03:21.375
I need to show you something.

03:21.418 --> 03:23.159
Of course. What's up?

03:27.990 --> 03:30.775
Okay, I'm not really sure

03:30.819 --> 03:32.821
what to believe
at this point, but...

03:32.864 --> 03:35.040
when you compare
the property lines,

03:35.084 --> 03:38.305
they don't match up,
which could mean...

03:38.348 --> 03:40.568
we're living
on the Davidsons' land.

03:40.611 --> 03:42.265
What?

03:42.309 --> 03:46.313
Liam, if that's true,
we need to fix it.

03:48.663 --> 03:51.013
Before it gets out of hand.

03:52.275 --> 03:55.931
Marv and I were never quite
the same after we lost the baby.

03:57.498 --> 04:00.805
He just drew further and
further away from me until...

04:02.024 --> 04:04.766
...one day, he was just gone.

04:05.549 --> 04:07.508
I'm sorry...

04:07.551 --> 04:09.510
for all that you've lost.

04:09.553 --> 04:11.468
I'm just looking
for some closure.

04:11.512 --> 04:13.296
Why won't you just...

04:13.340 --> 04:15.559
tell me what you know?

04:17.082 --> 04:20.390
Your life hasn't
been easy.

04:21.217 --> 04:24.481
And these were never
my secrets to tell.

04:24.525 --> 04:27.005
And I'm sorry.

04:27.049 --> 04:30.052
Digging it up
will only bring you more pain.

04:31.445 --> 04:34.752
Thank you so much
for that life lesson, Abby.

04:43.892 --> 04:47.025
It's gonna be all right.

04:47.069 --> 04:49.376
So how do we square this up?

04:49.419 --> 04:51.291
I imagine with something
more current

04:51.334 --> 04:54.337
than an antique map
or some land survey.

04:54.381 --> 04:55.686
When is this from?That's why I need us

04:55.730 --> 04:57.688
all on the same page. Dad?

04:57.732 --> 04:59.690
I'm gonna need
your copy of the deed

04:59.734 --> 05:01.257
to the ranch,
or anything with a more

05:01.301 --> 05:04.042
current date of ownership
to override the Davidsons'.

05:05.348 --> 05:07.394
Well, we have papers,
don't we, Bon?

05:07.437 --> 05:11.180
Yeah, I-I think our-our youngest
has a case of idle hands.

05:11.223 --> 05:14.226
The Walkers have worked
this land for generations.

05:14.270 --> 05:16.098
There's nothing more
to ownership than that.

05:17.360 --> 05:19.449
- Liam's just trying to help.
- Right.

05:19.493 --> 05:21.930
Um...All right, fine.

05:21.973 --> 05:24.976
If it will put y'all at ease,
I will call my lawyer--

05:25.020 --> 05:28.240
<i>my</i> lawyer-- and sort
this all out with him.

05:28.284 --> 05:30.068
At his hourly rate.

05:30.112 --> 05:32.201
Wait...

05:32.244 --> 05:33.681
Dad...?Yeah.

05:33.724 --> 05:35.770
Dad!

05:37.075 --> 05:39.426
I really need Dad
to cooperate with us.

05:39.469 --> 05:40.992
Yeah, Cordell,

05:41.036 --> 05:42.733
would you please talk
some sense into your father?

05:42.777 --> 05:44.909
You heard Mom, go!

05:44.953 --> 05:47.738
If the Davidsons
catch wind of this--Okay. Liam, I know, I know.

05:47.782 --> 05:50.175
Um...

05:52.308 --> 05:55.267
I can't look into this
right now, okay? Work.

05:55.311 --> 05:57.705
But I will.
I'll get to the bottom of it.

05:57.748 --> 06:00.229
Okay?

06:37.701 --> 06:39.616
Abeline's not home, Marvin.

06:39.660 --> 06:41.139
That's probably
for the better.

06:41.183 --> 06:43.315
Since I think you and I
need to have our own chat.

06:43.359 --> 06:46.797
Turns out, you Walkers have
been living on borrowed land

06:46.841 --> 06:48.320
Since 1873.

06:48.364 --> 06:51.585
Seems to me,
y'all overstayed your welcome.

06:51.628 --> 06:53.282
See for yourself.

07:01.986 --> 07:04.162
"By default, the agreed upon

07:04.206 --> 07:06.164
"land will revert
to original ownership

07:06.208 --> 07:08.515
"by John Davidson
and proceeding heirs.

07:08.558 --> 07:09.907
"Save for the invocation
of give and take

07:09.951 --> 07:11.300
in the distribution
of land."

07:11.343 --> 07:13.520
Yeah, Stan Morrison said
this might come up.

07:13.563 --> 07:14.999
But my family
has run a ranch

07:15.043 --> 07:16.653
on this land
for years.

07:16.697 --> 07:18.481
It's ours.

07:18.525 --> 07:21.005
Adverse possession and whatnot.

07:21.049 --> 07:23.181
You think that'll hold up
in court?

07:23.225 --> 07:24.835
Your word

07:24.879 --> 07:26.837
against a legal document?

07:26.881 --> 07:29.884
Well, I guess
I'm willing to find out.

07:30.711 --> 07:33.975
Why are you bringing
this up now, Marv?

07:34.018 --> 07:35.367
You hurting for money so bad

07:35.411 --> 07:37.326
you'd threaten
to kick me off my land?

07:37.369 --> 07:38.675
Just...

07:38.719 --> 07:40.503
thinking about legacy.

07:40.547 --> 07:42.200
Look...

07:42.244 --> 07:45.334
I'm not wild
about the two of us in suits,

07:45.377 --> 07:46.727
hiding
behind lawyers.

07:46.770 --> 07:48.511
You got a better idea?

07:48.555 --> 07:51.296
How about
a little give and take?

08:07.748 --> 08:08.879
Okay.

08:08.923 --> 08:10.925
All right.

08:10.968 --> 08:12.883
- Thanks.
- Great. Thanks, Rusty.

08:12.927 --> 08:14.972
- Yes, sir, thank you.
- My boy here hooked us up

08:15.016 --> 08:16.626
with some friends and
family discounts today.

08:16.670 --> 08:19.107
Your boy here has
some nice prison tats.

08:19.150 --> 08:21.196
Well, reformed,
obviously.

08:21.239 --> 08:22.676
We're friends.

08:22.719 --> 08:24.199
Yeah, since when?

08:24.242 --> 08:26.375
Since about, uh, 20 minutes
before you got here.

08:26.418 --> 08:28.246
Yeah, sure, all right.

08:28.290 --> 08:29.857
Look, more friends
in Austin means

08:29.900 --> 08:31.380
more chances to find Miles.

08:31.423 --> 08:33.991
- All right, you're on. Yep.
- All right, I'm climbing.

08:34.035 --> 08:35.689
And I trust my instincts.

08:35.732 --> 08:37.560
Like rock-climbing.

08:37.604 --> 08:38.822
Don't look back.

08:38.866 --> 08:40.476
Face what's ahead.
Take it

08:40.520 --> 08:42.565
one step at a time.

08:42.609 --> 08:44.524
Okay, so, uh...

08:44.567 --> 08:46.221
a lot of metaphors
about trusting yourself.

08:46.264 --> 08:47.701
I get it.

08:47.744 --> 08:49.572
Can't trust myself
entirely.

08:49.616 --> 08:52.183
After all, I didn't
immediately write you off.

08:52.227 --> 08:54.403
No, no, you didn't immediately
write me off.

08:54.446 --> 08:56.231
You tased me
and shoved me in the trunk,

08:56.274 --> 08:58.538
which is so much better
than being written off.

08:58.581 --> 08:59.887
Everyone knows that.

09:03.543 --> 09:04.805
All right, looking good.

09:04.848 --> 09:06.502
Keep it going,
you're almost there.

09:06.546 --> 09:08.373
Now we're rock and rolling.

09:08.417 --> 09:11.420
All right and...

09:11.463 --> 09:12.552
- Bam!
- Look at that.

09:12.595 --> 09:14.554
- Not too bad.
- All right.

09:14.597 --> 09:16.599
Coming down.

09:19.602 --> 09:22.039
- Nice job.
- Thank you very much, sir.

09:22.083 --> 09:25.216
By the way, speaking of,
uh, taser-gate,

09:25.260 --> 09:27.131
hope that's not how you treat
all your new friends.

09:27.175 --> 09:29.394
Speaking of new friends,

09:29.438 --> 09:31.962
I was supposed to meet
the D.A. in person today.

09:32.006 --> 09:34.443
Her office canceled last minute.
Lame.

09:34.486 --> 09:37.098
Well... give her a chance.

09:37.141 --> 09:39.013
Look, once you meet her,
you'll like her.

09:39.056 --> 09:40.710
All right? She's good people.

09:40.754 --> 09:42.582
Cool, so I should disregard

09:42.625 --> 09:45.062
everything I've heard
about the feud of the century?

09:46.586 --> 09:48.283
Look, it doesn't
affect our work.

09:48.326 --> 09:51.155
All right, for what it's worth,
I trust her.

09:51.199 --> 09:52.635
So regardless of who

09:52.679 --> 09:55.072
her family is, believe me.

09:55.116 --> 09:57.074
- Am I set?
- Yeah, pulley's on.

09:57.118 --> 09:58.728
Okay, climbing.

09:58.772 --> 10:00.600
Climb on.
Yep.

10:00.643 --> 10:04.560
So... love thy D.A.
neighbor much?

10:04.604 --> 10:06.475
Better tone that down,
especially if things

10:06.518 --> 10:07.432
with Geri are a go.

10:07.476 --> 10:09.609
Don't think I didn't

10:09.652 --> 10:11.480
clock the little pep
in your step.

10:11.523 --> 10:14.048
Yeah, well, uh,
don't get too excited.

10:14.091 --> 10:16.267
Thanks for the nudge.

10:16.311 --> 10:19.096
I don't want it to be weird.
You know, my kids

10:19.140 --> 10:20.663
have known Geri
their whole lives.

10:20.707 --> 10:23.100
Yeah, but what kind
of little monsters

10:23.144 --> 10:25.407
did you raise if they don't
want you to be happy?

10:25.450 --> 10:27.017
- Okay, all right.
- Trust your instincts.

10:27.061 --> 10:29.759
I do trust my instincts,
obviously.

10:29.803 --> 10:31.282
I mean, I'm...

10:31.326 --> 10:32.632
up here on a...

10:32.675 --> 10:35.025
dang wall
in the middle of a...

10:35.069 --> 10:37.680
Hey! Hey, hey, hey,
you're not supposed to let go!

10:37.724 --> 10:39.290
You're not supposed
to look down.

10:39.334 --> 10:41.641
Well, I-I am looking down
and you--

10:41.684 --> 10:42.467
Seriously?!

10:42.511 --> 10:44.295
- Am I set?
- I'm back.

10:45.340 --> 10:47.559
Halfway there.

10:47.603 --> 10:50.693
Yeah, tell me about it.

11:01.399 --> 11:03.227
You want to race?

11:03.271 --> 11:05.534
No, I'm not interested.

11:05.577 --> 11:07.623
Oh, come on.

11:09.233 --> 11:11.322
So my dad only came home
this morning.

11:11.366 --> 11:13.803
He slept somewhere else
last night,

11:13.847 --> 11:15.631
and then wouldn't say much else.

11:15.675 --> 11:17.677
Well, that sucks.

11:18.852 --> 11:21.115
"That sucks"?

11:21.158 --> 11:22.856
That's all you have
to say about it?

11:22.899 --> 11:25.249
Colton, are you okay?

11:25.293 --> 11:27.338
Yeah, I'm fine. It's just...

11:27.382 --> 11:29.993
Why don't you just talk
to Todd about this stuff?

11:30.037 --> 11:31.821
What?

11:33.301 --> 11:34.606
No, I get it, maybe a fling

11:34.650 --> 11:36.130
just isn't a good listener.

11:36.173 --> 11:38.872
What do you mean, "a fling"?

11:38.915 --> 11:40.438
Your rebound.

11:40.482 --> 11:42.832
Your first relationship
since the infamous Trevor.

11:42.876 --> 11:44.616
You know, August agrees
that this probably

11:44.660 --> 11:46.227
isn't the romance
of the century.

11:46.270 --> 11:48.359
Okay, that's pretty presumptuous

11:48.403 --> 11:51.232
and disrespectful...
of you and August!

11:51.275 --> 11:53.234
Why would he even
say that to you?

11:57.194 --> 11:59.675
Do you really not know why,
Stella?

12:25.875 --> 12:28.095
It's my fault.

12:28.138 --> 12:30.532
No it isn't, baby.

12:30.575 --> 12:33.230
Uh, do you want scrambled
or sunny-side up?

12:33.274 --> 12:35.058
Um, you know what?

12:35.102 --> 12:36.886
I don't have much
of an appetite since

12:36.930 --> 12:39.367
that Serano mess, so...

12:40.629 --> 12:42.979
You know what, you can't resist

12:43.023 --> 12:45.068
my huevos rancheros.
I think we're out of beans,

12:45.112 --> 12:46.374
I'm gonna run to the store.

12:46.417 --> 12:48.768
Dan.
Yes?

12:50.030 --> 12:52.032
I got to ask you.

12:52.075 --> 12:55.209
Is there something
that you're not telling me?

12:55.252 --> 12:57.689
No one wants to fix us more than

12:57.733 --> 12:59.561
I do, all right?

12:59.604 --> 13:01.781
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

13:02.825 --> 13:04.566
Okay.

13:04.609 --> 13:07.177
Okay.

13:10.006 --> 13:12.095
Trouble?

13:12.139 --> 13:14.924
I picked up on your tone.
I'm not sure

13:14.968 --> 13:16.273
that Dan did.

13:16.317 --> 13:18.232
Some things have come up.

13:18.275 --> 13:20.103
And I don't know

13:20.147 --> 13:21.235
what to think.

13:21.278 --> 13:22.802
What things?

13:22.845 --> 13:26.109
You know how he saved
Liam's life at Walker Ranch?

13:26.153 --> 13:28.285
- Yeah.
- Dan could've just shot

13:28.329 --> 13:30.635
that guy in the leg
and disarmed him.

13:30.679 --> 13:32.812
But he chose
to shoot him in the back

13:32.855 --> 13:35.684
and kill him.
Now why would he do that?

13:35.727 --> 13:38.295
Look, honey, I don't know,
he panicked.

13:38.339 --> 13:40.297
You know, he was
just acting in the moment.

13:40.341 --> 13:42.430
I don't know.

13:42.473 --> 13:44.301
It just doesn't
sit right with me.

13:44.345 --> 13:47.348
And we have been
struggling so much.

13:47.391 --> 13:49.306
I'm asking myself why.

13:49.350 --> 13:51.656
Is... is it worth it?

13:51.700 --> 13:54.790
Oh, honey, look, marriage
is-is full of compromise.

13:54.834 --> 13:56.183
Yeah.

13:56.226 --> 13:58.533
Now... I loved your daddy.

13:58.576 --> 14:00.317
But I'd be lying
to you if I said

14:00.361 --> 14:02.667
I never considered
walking away.

14:02.711 --> 14:04.234
Yeah, I remember.

14:04.278 --> 14:06.149
A partner's dishonesty

14:06.193 --> 14:07.977
can cause...

14:08.021 --> 14:10.023
a lot of problems.

14:10.893 --> 14:13.896
You just do what's right
for you. Nobody knows

14:13.940 --> 14:15.245
what goes on between two people.

14:15.289 --> 14:16.856
Yeah, okay.

14:19.467 --> 14:21.817
At least, most of the time
nobody knows.

14:21.861 --> 14:23.123
Okay, what's that about?

14:23.166 --> 14:24.341
Is that about your talk
with Abeline?

14:24.385 --> 14:26.082
She and your father

14:26.126 --> 14:28.128
spoke before he passed.

14:28.171 --> 14:29.390
About what?

14:29.433 --> 14:31.000
Yeah, yeah,
you'd think she'd say.

14:31.044 --> 14:34.612
If Cordell hadn't left
that lantern in the barn,

14:34.656 --> 14:36.876
your father would
still be alive today.

14:36.919 --> 14:39.704
Everybody knows it,
including their family.

14:39.748 --> 14:41.619
I don't want
- to talk about this.
- Well, it's the truth.

14:53.066 --> 14:55.982
Mm.

14:56.025 --> 14:57.766
Hey.
Hey.

14:57.809 --> 14:59.376
Uh, earlier...

14:59.420 --> 15:01.378
were you saying something

15:01.422 --> 15:02.771
about a lantern?

15:02.814 --> 15:04.904
Ah, you heard that, yeah.

15:04.947 --> 15:07.297
It's ancient history.
It's not your concern.

15:08.472 --> 15:10.648
O-Okay, well,

15:10.692 --> 15:13.129
August was saying something

15:13.173 --> 15:16.741
about a lantern with his
family's brand or whatever.

15:16.785 --> 15:19.527
And he got it
from the burnt-out barn.

15:19.570 --> 15:21.442
In our barn?

15:21.485 --> 15:23.531
Yeah, he had it
in his house,

15:23.574 --> 15:25.098
but he didn't
show it to me.

15:25.141 --> 15:28.536
Well, that's tasteless.

15:29.885 --> 15:32.932
You know, if I took that lantern
to the authorities,

15:32.975 --> 15:36.022
the Walkers might finally
get their comeuppance.

15:37.937 --> 15:40.809
Well, maybe I could get it
from August.

15:40.852 --> 15:42.724
I mean, it's not cool
that they have it.

15:42.767 --> 15:45.466
I mean,
considering what it means.

15:45.509 --> 15:47.250
Well, thank you, Colton.

15:47.294 --> 15:49.470
Good to know you're on my side.

15:50.775 --> 15:52.821
Yeah.

15:59.132 --> 16:01.961
Hey.

16:02.004 --> 16:03.745
Ger?

16:03.788 --> 16:05.877
I was thinking, uh,
about dinner tonight,

16:05.921 --> 16:08.532
you know, at the ranch, um...
why don't we...?

16:08.576 --> 16:10.578
Why don't we go ahead
and tell the family?

16:10.621 --> 16:12.493
You know, about us?

16:12.536 --> 16:14.886
- Oh.
- Yeah.

16:14.930 --> 16:16.714
O-Okay, um...

16:16.758 --> 16:18.281
A dinner

16:18.325 --> 16:20.022
announcement... that's...Yeah, yeah, sure.

16:20.066 --> 16:21.328
very serious.

16:21.371 --> 16:23.504
Yeah, well, uh, I...

16:23.547 --> 16:25.375
I am serious.

16:25.419 --> 16:27.334
Dolly.

16:27.377 --> 16:30.032
Dolly? Wait, D-Dolly, Dolly?

16:30.076 --> 16:31.425
Just like a little Dolly.

16:31.468 --> 16:33.296
Oh, you got to be kidding me.

16:35.168 --> 16:37.039
What, what's that about?

16:37.083 --> 16:39.476
Oh, it's nothing,
Liam, he's, he's...

16:39.520 --> 16:41.435
he's obsessing about
whether or not our family

16:41.478 --> 16:43.828
is in a land dispute, and I told
him I was gonna take care of it.

16:43.872 --> 16:45.265
- A land dispute?
- Yeah.

16:45.308 --> 16:47.093
With the Davidsons?

16:47.136 --> 16:48.920
Yeah, but it-it's nothing.

16:48.964 --> 16:50.618
I mean, I'll-I'll handle it.

16:50.661 --> 16:51.706
I don't want to get you mixed up

16:51.749 --> 16:53.055
in all my old family crap.

16:53.099 --> 16:55.231
- Yeah, but it's me.
- Yeah.

16:55.275 --> 16:57.712
I know
all of your old family crap.

16:57.755 --> 16:59.453
Okay, you are

16:59.496 --> 17:01.324
all over the place
right now, buddy.

17:01.368 --> 17:03.283
"Buddy"? Bu--? So-so "Dolly"

17:03.326 --> 17:05.154
- and now "Buddy"?
- No! Oh, my God!

17:05.198 --> 17:07.026
- It was a little Dolly!
- What did I do?

17:07.069 --> 17:08.288
- Stop, stop.
- I do-- but...

17:08.331 --> 17:10.072
Stop.

17:10.116 --> 17:12.640
Okay.

17:17.601 --> 17:19.212
Ooh.

17:19.255 --> 17:20.778
What?

17:20.822 --> 17:22.128
Okay.

17:22.171 --> 17:23.564
Yeah.
Oh.

17:27.568 --> 17:29.657
Yeah, I'm gonna...

17:29.700 --> 17:31.267
I'll see you at dinner.

17:31.311 --> 17:32.660
Okay. Yeah. Uh...

17:36.403 --> 17:38.448
Yeah.

17:50.243 --> 17:52.984
You know, I know a good shop
that tints car windows.

17:53.028 --> 17:55.596
Just in case
y'all need a little bit more

17:55.639 --> 17:57.511
privacy.
Oh, my God!

17:57.554 --> 17:58.816
Stop.

17:58.860 --> 18:00.557
So y'all are
finally giving it a shot!

18:00.601 --> 18:01.819
It's about damn time.

18:01.863 --> 18:03.647
It's a developing story.

18:03.691 --> 18:05.214
Uh-huh, so what should

18:05.258 --> 18:07.260
the tabloids
call you?

18:07.303 --> 18:10.132
- Gerdell? Corri?
- Oh, my...

18:10.176 --> 18:11.742
No, no, no! Cordri!

18:11.786 --> 18:14.658
Stop it,
I'm trying to avoid labels.

18:14.702 --> 18:17.748
Okay, labels mean expectations.

18:17.792 --> 18:19.794
You know, people buy

18:19.837 --> 18:23.406
a brand of liquor for
their nostalgia, familiarity,

18:23.450 --> 18:26.017
status. But no labels

18:26.061 --> 18:27.932
means you don't know
what you're gonna get.

18:27.976 --> 18:29.891
And you can't be mad
if what's inside that bottle

18:29.934 --> 18:32.241
doesn't meet your expectations.

18:32.285 --> 18:35.723
Yeah, it could be
intoxicating or it could be

18:35.766 --> 18:38.073
toxic.

18:38.117 --> 18:39.770
Or...

18:39.814 --> 18:41.642
it could be
that you're hiding

18:41.685 --> 18:43.383
behind a well-crafted metaphor.

18:43.426 --> 18:45.211
Hmm.

18:45.254 --> 18:47.169
Well, you are

18:47.213 --> 18:50.999
lightyears better than the
guidance counselor that we had.

18:51.826 --> 18:53.306
All I'm saying is...

18:53.349 --> 18:55.656
we're just trying
to find our footing.

18:55.699 --> 18:58.441
I don't really know
where I land.

18:59.268 --> 19:01.444
Look, it might be
like that thing

19:01.488 --> 19:05.187
when a...
when a Ranger cares about you

19:05.231 --> 19:08.973
and wants to keep you
from the mess in their lives.

19:09.017 --> 19:12.063
But, listen,
from where I'm standing,

19:12.107 --> 19:13.978
it sounds
like both you and Walker

19:14.022 --> 19:16.155
want to get to the same place.

19:17.504 --> 19:20.594
I mean, I hope so.

19:20.637 --> 19:22.596
Me, too.

19:22.639 --> 19:24.206
Yeah.

19:24.250 --> 19:26.556
<i> This is all happening so fast!</i>

19:26.600 --> 19:28.210
I thought we were
in a good place together!

19:28.254 --> 19:30.256
I was trying to be!

19:30.299 --> 19:32.910
But I know

19:32.954 --> 19:35.217
that you were part of Serano's
surveillance operation.

19:35.261 --> 19:37.350
I saw the footage.

19:37.393 --> 19:39.613
Then you weaseled
an immunity deal from me.

19:39.656 --> 19:42.224
- From behind my back!
- I did that to protect you.

19:42.268 --> 19:44.226
And I did that
to protect your career!

19:44.270 --> 19:46.054
Hey, do you know
what I put up with?!

19:46.097 --> 19:49.492
I had to sit there and watch you
practically sit in his damn lap!

19:49.536 --> 19:52.495
Do you know
how exhausting it is?

19:52.539 --> 19:56.238
To sit here and try and
figure out if you're lying?

19:56.282 --> 19:59.285
- Come on.
- Dan, we are not
gonna get anywhere

19:59.328 --> 20:01.461
fighting like this--
just get out.

20:01.504 --> 20:03.114
Please.

20:04.159 --> 20:05.726
You're kicking me out.

20:05.769 --> 20:07.945
You're kicking me out?
I am a good father

20:07.989 --> 20:10.557
to Colton and I am loyal
to this family.

20:10.600 --> 20:12.254
You need this family.

20:12.298 --> 20:14.822
And you rely on my job
to protect you.

20:16.563 --> 20:18.478
Wow.

20:18.521 --> 20:20.262
Thank you for that.

20:20.306 --> 20:22.308
You know, I know that I might
not be the best person,

20:22.351 --> 20:25.615
Dan...
but you know
where I came from.

20:25.659 --> 20:26.834
And how hard I've worked.

20:26.877 --> 20:28.531
The Walkers are not good people.

20:28.575 --> 20:31.055
They've been gunning for us
the second we got here.

20:31.099 --> 20:32.622
I don't understand
how you trust them.

20:32.666 --> 20:33.841
I don't.

20:33.884 --> 20:35.669
It's not about them.

20:35.712 --> 20:38.106
It's about us.

20:38.149 --> 20:41.022
Get out.

21:03.131 --> 21:04.915
All right, yeah,
I appreciate it, Counselor.

21:04.959 --> 21:06.961
All right.

21:13.576 --> 21:15.056
Hold on.

21:16.840 --> 21:19.669
Have a seat.

21:23.760 --> 21:25.719
I found this lantern
in your room.

21:25.762 --> 21:27.851
You gonna tell me
how it got there?

21:27.895 --> 21:29.549
Yeah, uh...

21:29.592 --> 21:30.941
I, uh...He found it

21:30.985 --> 21:33.509
when he fell through
the roof of the Davidsons' barn.

21:33.553 --> 21:34.641
Stella, what the heck?

21:34.684 --> 21:37.208
Davidsons' barn?

21:37.252 --> 21:39.298
Anyone see you take it?

21:39.341 --> 21:42.823
Yeah, just some friends
we had over.

21:42.866 --> 21:45.565
And I told Dad we went
to the barn later, so...

21:45.608 --> 21:47.567
Your dad knows?

21:51.179 --> 21:53.399
You know, going on
someone else's property

21:53.442 --> 21:56.184
without them knowing
is trespassing, son.

21:56.227 --> 21:58.882
You're right, yeah.
I'm sorry.

21:58.926 --> 22:00.101
It's just a lantern.

22:00.144 --> 22:02.146
Well, you damn well know
it's not just that

22:02.190 --> 22:03.713
or else you wouldn't
have hidden it.

22:03.757 --> 22:07.456
I should've dealt
with this a long time ago.

22:07.500 --> 22:10.807
You're lucky that
no Davidsons saw.

22:10.851 --> 22:12.592
But that'll be
the last time.

22:12.635 --> 22:14.376
You hear?

22:14.420 --> 22:16.509
Loud and clear.

22:17.684 --> 22:20.469
No more... secrets.

22:20.513 --> 22:23.080
Yes, sir.

22:23.951 --> 22:25.605
All right.

22:25.648 --> 22:27.258
Go on.

22:43.274 --> 22:45.015
Why would you do that, Stel?

22:45.059 --> 22:46.843
Why would you even
say that to Colton?

22:46.887 --> 22:48.018
What, I should just
let my friend fall

22:48.062 --> 22:49.280
flat on his
face like that?

22:49.324 --> 22:50.891
It wasn't your
place to tell him

22:50.934 --> 22:52.371
what to do or
what not to do.

22:52.414 --> 22:54.242
I'm sorry, I just didn't want
to lose another friend,

22:54.285 --> 22:56.113
Stella, because of...

22:56.157 --> 22:57.593
because of you.

22:57.637 --> 23:00.814
Like everything that's
happened is all my fault?

23:00.857 --> 23:02.381
What you said

23:02.424 --> 23:04.295
about me and Todd
is messed up.

23:04.339 --> 23:06.689
Okay, ho, ho, hold on,
wait a second.

23:06.733 --> 23:09.431
What, what's going on here?
Why are we fighting?

23:09.475 --> 23:11.825
Stel?

23:11.868 --> 23:14.001
Augie?

23:14.044 --> 23:16.395
Okay, I said that...

23:16.438 --> 23:18.614
you know, she was still
getting over Trevor Strand.

23:18.658 --> 23:21.574
And she's not ready
for something serious.

23:21.617 --> 23:23.402
And this whole thing
with Todd just isn't.

23:23.445 --> 23:25.534
You don't
know how I feel.

23:25.578 --> 23:28.276
About Trevor or Todd.
And it's not up to you.

23:28.319 --> 23:30.409
I know, I...

23:30.452 --> 23:32.933
I just mean, don't you feel like
you deserve a little bit of fun?

23:32.976 --> 23:34.543
Stel, you know,
someone that is-is

23:34.587 --> 23:36.240
less adjacent to family drama?

23:36.284 --> 23:38.155
I feel like we all deserve that.

23:38.852 --> 23:40.593
I'm sorry.

23:41.898 --> 23:43.552
Hey?

23:43.596 --> 23:45.162
She knows.

23:45.206 --> 23:46.947
But, hey,
will you, uh...

23:46.990 --> 23:50.124
get ready for supper? I'm,
I'm gonna talk to your sister.

23:54.302 --> 23:56.957
Stel, uh...
Dad?

23:57.000 --> 23:58.785
As weird as it is

23:58.828 --> 24:01.265
when you walk-of-shame it,

24:01.309 --> 24:04.225
I guess it's
cool that you're

24:04.268 --> 24:06.793
getting back out there.

24:07.924 --> 24:09.970
Thanks, Stel.

24:10.013 --> 24:12.146
Do you think Augie has a point?

24:12.189 --> 24:14.496
About it being too soon?

24:14.540 --> 24:16.716
I mean, how
do you know

24:16.759 --> 24:18.892
when you should
open up with someone?

24:18.935 --> 24:20.937
Or trust them?

24:20.981 --> 24:23.462
Stel, I think, um...

24:25.681 --> 24:28.815
I think, I think you'll know
when you know.

24:28.858 --> 24:30.599
But I also think...

24:30.643 --> 24:33.472
your daddy might
not be the best person to ask

24:33.515 --> 24:36.126
about this because I'm still

24:36.170 --> 24:38.215
trying to figure it out myself.

24:38.259 --> 24:41.175
Hey, um...

24:41.218 --> 24:43.482
why don't you get ready
for supper, okay?

24:47.703 --> 24:49.488
Hey.

24:50.271 --> 24:53.187
- Hey.
- Hey.

24:53.230 --> 24:55.885
You gonna...?Yeah! Yeah. Yes.

24:58.061 --> 25:00.368
All Rangers within a five-block
radius of South Congress.

25:00.411 --> 25:03.110
Drunk in public,
but handle with care.

25:03.153 --> 25:04.720
- Copy.
- The D.A.'s husband is...

25:04.764 --> 25:06.287
in need of an escort home.

25:06.330 --> 25:09.290
Please be discreet.

25:14.208 --> 25:15.644
Howdy, sir.

25:17.864 --> 25:19.474
I'm Ranger Perez.

25:19.518 --> 25:21.345
How about you come down
off the truck

25:21.389 --> 25:23.086
here and we'll get you
home to the D.A.?

25:23.130 --> 25:24.392
Oh, my wife?

25:25.872 --> 25:28.570
I love her so much.

25:28.614 --> 25:30.833
Bet she'll be glad
to see you, too.

25:30.877 --> 25:32.182
I doubt it.

25:32.226 --> 25:34.358
She hates me.

25:34.402 --> 25:37.144
I love her, but she hates me.

25:37.187 --> 25:39.581
Maybe she'll hate you
a little less

25:39.625 --> 25:41.888
if you're home safe
with her and not...

25:41.931 --> 25:43.890
drunk in public?

25:43.933 --> 25:46.283
Yeah, you're right.

25:46.327 --> 25:49.156
Ooh!

25:49.199 --> 25:52.202
You got it?

25:57.904 --> 26:00.167
No, that way, that way.

26:12.527 --> 26:13.702
You good?

26:15.095 --> 26:16.705
Howdy, ma'am.

26:22.668 --> 26:24.104
Ranger Perez.

26:24.147 --> 26:25.584
Appreciate your help
with this.

26:25.627 --> 26:27.237
Wish we were meeting
on different terms.

26:27.281 --> 26:29.675
Perez is, uh, Walker's
new partner.

26:29.718 --> 26:33.069
Oh, well, if you're with Walker,
you're not on our side.

26:34.462 --> 26:36.551
Or I'm Switzerland.

26:36.595 --> 26:38.814
You know, the D.A.
doesn't trust any Walkers.

26:38.858 --> 26:40.990
Okay, Dan,
that's enough.

26:41.034 --> 26:42.818
Just go get some water.

26:42.862 --> 26:44.907
I'm sorry.

26:51.827 --> 26:53.873
Push.

26:58.529 --> 27:00.270
Uh, we should've kept
our earlier meeting

27:00.314 --> 27:01.489
on the books.
No.

27:01.532 --> 27:03.534
It's more memorable this way.

27:03.578 --> 27:05.493
Look, I've read your file.

27:05.536 --> 27:08.409
And I am up to speed
on your search for Ranger Vyas.

27:08.452 --> 27:12.021
DPS might consider it
a waste of time, but...

27:12.065 --> 27:13.675
I'd be willing to...

27:13.719 --> 27:16.286
be as discreet and as helpful

27:16.330 --> 27:18.288
as I can be,

27:18.332 --> 27:20.769
if you could also be discreet.

27:23.119 --> 27:24.904
Ma'am.

27:30.257 --> 27:31.606
Oh, why don't we...All right.

27:31.650 --> 27:33.390
Thank you, Daddy,
thank you, Mama.

27:33.434 --> 27:34.740
That was great.

27:34.783 --> 27:35.958
Oh, here, I'll get this.

27:36.002 --> 27:37.873
- Oh, I'll take yours.
- Oh, thanks, Stel.

27:37.917 --> 27:38.961
No problem.

27:39.005 --> 27:41.398
Look at that.

27:43.096 --> 27:46.273
Listen, I know that I
threw out a Dolly earlier.

27:46.316 --> 27:48.101
But it was out
of my own fear.

27:48.144 --> 27:50.364
No, fear...

27:50.407 --> 27:51.713
- that wasn't the right word.
- It's okay.

27:51.757 --> 27:54.194
- It's scary.
- It is scary.

27:54.237 --> 27:55.456
But it's not bad.

27:55.499 --> 27:57.240
I'm good to make it real.

27:58.154 --> 28:00.504
- Let's say it.
- Now?

28:00.548 --> 28:01.810
I mean, this is...Your brother's
gonna figure it out.

28:01.854 --> 28:02.768
The deed is a problem.

28:02.811 --> 28:05.422
Told you
to leave it alone, Liam!

28:05.466 --> 28:07.990
How is the deed on file
from the 19th century?

28:08.034 --> 28:11.559
Okay? We have to update it,
and clear up the language.

28:11.602 --> 28:13.909
You are just aggravating
the hell out of me, son.

28:13.953 --> 28:15.737
Walkers have lived
on this stretch

28:15.781 --> 28:17.173
of land for generations.

28:17.217 --> 28:19.741
All the more reason
that we should re-litigate it,

28:19.785 --> 28:21.700
clear up
the vague stipulations.

28:21.743 --> 28:22.701
A deed should

28:22.744 --> 28:24.833
explicitly
grant us ownership.

28:24.877 --> 28:26.095
I'm not sure why it doesn't.

28:26.139 --> 28:28.619
Hey, hey, why
don't we, uh...

28:28.663 --> 28:30.926
table this talk
for another time?

28:30.970 --> 28:33.973
Uh, we wanted
to-to say something.

28:34.974 --> 28:36.845
Uh, we, you
know, we can get

28:36.889 --> 28:38.107
into crossing lines
at a different time.

28:38.151 --> 28:39.718
Yeah, well,
speaking of crossing lines,

28:39.761 --> 28:42.459
your son went to the Davidsons'
barn and you didn't tell me.

28:42.503 --> 28:45.724
Need I remind you what happened
last time that a Walker

28:45.767 --> 28:47.813
trespassed
on Davidson grounds?

28:47.856 --> 28:49.292
It was harmless, Daddy.

28:49.336 --> 28:52.861
Yeah, well, harmless then
may not be so harmless now.

28:52.905 --> 28:55.559
Your son put us in...

28:56.778 --> 28:58.824
Denise Davidson.

28:58.867 --> 29:02.436
The Davidsons want to meet ASAP.

29:02.479 --> 29:04.786
Neutral ground.

29:15.623 --> 29:19.540
Maybe you'll finally get
your peace summit, Cordell.

29:25.981 --> 29:27.200
Hi there.

29:27.243 --> 29:29.898
So what do we owe the pleasure?

29:29.942 --> 29:33.075
A friend at the County
Assessor's Office

29:33.119 --> 29:34.729
tipped me off.

29:34.773 --> 29:36.731
There's been a curious uptick
in looking into our properties.

29:37.906 --> 29:40.430
So I know you have the deeds.
Show it to me.

29:40.474 --> 29:43.390
Okay, uh, Liam?

29:43.433 --> 29:45.435
Got to say, uh, this feels like,

29:45.479 --> 29:47.524
like a bit of an ambush,
you know?

29:47.568 --> 29:50.571
Apologies,
that's not very neighborly.

29:50.614 --> 29:53.443
You Walkers aren't exactly
the poster family

29:53.487 --> 29:55.663
for neighborly
behavior either.

29:55.706 --> 29:58.144
Okay, hold on, let's all...

29:58.187 --> 30:00.320
keep our heads cool,
keep our wits about us.

30:00.363 --> 30:03.323
We-we can talk this
- through civilly.
- Mm-hmm.

30:03.366 --> 30:05.281
Well,
from the language here,

30:05.325 --> 30:06.674
this land has
always been ours.

30:06.717 --> 30:09.546
Your family borrowed it
for a period.

30:09.590 --> 30:10.678
But it should've
been returned.

30:10.721 --> 30:11.984
What about adverse possession?

30:12.027 --> 30:13.202
Squatter's rights?

30:13.246 --> 30:14.508
Then your father

30:14.551 --> 30:15.988
or your grandfather
should've put

30:16.031 --> 30:18.164
that down in writing
once they were able to claim it.

30:18.207 --> 30:20.688
Well, we don't have those
documents on hand right now,

30:20.731 --> 30:22.821
but years of tax returns
will go against

30:22.864 --> 30:25.606
a vaguely written deed
from 1873.

30:25.649 --> 30:27.086
What are you saying?

30:27.129 --> 30:29.218
We're gonna have to go
to court to sort this out?

30:29.262 --> 30:31.525
- Again.
And how's that gonna look?

30:31.568 --> 30:33.657
The D.A. suing her neighbors

30:33.701 --> 30:36.095
over a centuries-old
land dispute?

30:36.138 --> 30:38.706
Careful who you hitch
your wagon to there, honey.

30:38.749 --> 30:40.142
I mean,
she does have a point.

30:40.186 --> 30:43.189
The D.A.'s office had
a shady track record before me.

30:43.232 --> 30:46.148
And we don't want
- to be drawing comparisons.
- All right.

31:01.729 --> 31:03.687
August!

31:03.731 --> 31:06.777
So what about the stipulation
in the deed?

31:06.821 --> 31:08.605
An invocation of something.

31:08.649 --> 31:09.998
I'm not gonna let
my family concede

31:10.042 --> 31:12.435
when I don't know
what "give and take" means.

31:12.479 --> 31:14.916
"Give and take"--
it's a horse racing term.

31:14.960 --> 31:17.223
The give-and-take plate
was awarded to the winner

31:17.266 --> 31:19.529
of the race where horses over
a certain height carried

31:19.573 --> 31:20.791
more weight for fairness.

31:20.835 --> 31:22.228
Doesn't make sense
in a land deed.

31:22.271 --> 31:24.970
They used to settle disputes
with horse racing.

31:25.013 --> 31:26.232
It's like,
you know, a quickdraw,

31:26.275 --> 31:27.494
but without the firearms.

31:27.537 --> 31:28.756
Progressive, great.

31:28.799 --> 31:30.540
But is that even relevant

31:30.584 --> 31:33.413
today-- I mean, would that hold
up in a court of law right now?

31:33.456 --> 31:36.633
So long as there's a contract,
yeah, I mean, I guess it could.

31:36.677 --> 31:38.505
I got one.

31:38.548 --> 31:41.377
Right here.

31:41.421 --> 31:43.640
Between me and Marv.

31:47.079 --> 31:49.429
Marvin came to me, said he
wanted to take back the land

31:49.472 --> 31:52.432
that his family gave
the Walkers in 1873.

31:52.475 --> 31:55.043
You've known about this
since then?

31:55.087 --> 31:57.132
I have.

31:59.482 --> 32:02.355
Neither one of us wanted to get
wrapped up in the legal nuances.

32:02.398 --> 32:04.835
And Marv was
bent on getting things

32:04.879 --> 32:07.490
settled quick and dirty,
so he proposed that we...

32:07.534 --> 32:09.405
A horse race?

32:09.449 --> 32:11.407
Are you joking?

32:11.451 --> 32:13.496
I'm not.

32:13.540 --> 32:16.935
If I won, our family would
keep living on the land

32:16.978 --> 32:20.025
like we have for years.
If Marv won...

32:20.895 --> 32:23.550
...the land would revert
back to the Davidsons

32:23.593 --> 32:26.205
and we'd be forced to leave.

32:28.424 --> 32:31.297
Okay, uh, what-what happened?

32:33.473 --> 32:35.170
Well, Marv died in the fire.

32:35.214 --> 32:38.347
And while I was, and still am,
incredibly sorry for your loss,

32:38.391 --> 32:40.959
no one else knew about
the agreement after Marv passed,

32:41.002 --> 32:44.092
and I thought it was best
no one else should.

32:44.136 --> 32:45.833
You knew we had a stake
to this land

32:45.876 --> 32:47.704
and you said nothing?

32:47.748 --> 32:49.880
First the lantern,

32:49.924 --> 32:52.013
- the deed, now this.
- Ah, well, hell, Gale.

32:52.057 --> 32:53.623
You want to talk
about a stake in land?

32:53.667 --> 32:55.408
149 years.

32:55.451 --> 32:59.194
Walkers have worked
and cared for this land

32:59.238 --> 33:00.717
for 149 damn years.

33:00.761 --> 33:02.458
- 'Cause you stole it!
- Our land, our land.

33:02.502 --> 33:05.374
Okay, okay, okay, we're not
any closer to resolving this.

33:05.418 --> 33:07.594
Marv and Dad,
they never fulfilled

33:07.637 --> 33:09.770
this contract that they signed,
so what are we gonna do?

33:09.813 --> 33:11.946
How about we pick up
where they left off?

33:11.990 --> 33:15.602
A race between families
under Marv's terms.

33:15.645 --> 33:18.300
But how about we raise
the stakes-- whoever wins,

33:18.344 --> 33:20.607
owns all of this land,
in perpetuity.

33:20.650 --> 33:23.044
That's quite a gamble, Gale,
considering that you only have

33:23.088 --> 33:25.612
that one injured horse
- that the kids rescued.
- You don't know that.

33:25.655 --> 33:27.266
- Well, maybe I do.
- You don't.

33:27.309 --> 33:30.269
Okay, hold on, we're not
gonna solve this with some...

33:30.312 --> 33:31.922
Wild West means

33:31.966 --> 33:34.055
- of negotiation.
- Yeah, this is nuts, it's nuts.

33:34.099 --> 33:35.796
It's also a tradition

33:35.839 --> 33:38.059
that both our fathers honored.

33:38.103 --> 33:39.365
So let's
just go back home,

33:39.408 --> 33:41.802
and start drawing up
a contract. Liam?

33:41.845 --> 33:43.978
Are you kidding me?
Yeah...

33:44.022 --> 33:46.459
Challenge accepted.

33:52.943 --> 33:56.643
I'm just curious to see which
one of you Davidsons saddle up.

33:56.686 --> 33:59.820
I bet you are.

34:07.001 --> 34:10.178
All right, I think this language
spells things out nicely.

34:10.222 --> 34:13.399
I'll type it up.
Great.

34:13.442 --> 34:16.750
I can't believe
this is happening.

34:16.793 --> 34:18.056
It's like I said.

34:18.099 --> 34:20.754
It's tradition.

34:21.059 --> 34:23.017
Best of luck, William.

34:23.800 --> 34:25.541
You, too.

34:25.585 --> 34:27.369
D.A. Davidson-Miller.

34:29.241 --> 34:31.591
Since you have personally gone
out of your way to dig into

34:31.634 --> 34:34.550
my family's business multiple
times since we've come back

34:34.594 --> 34:37.814
to Austin, I want you
to be the first to know

34:37.858 --> 34:39.207
I'm having my office

34:39.251 --> 34:42.950
reopen my father's
wrongful death investigation.

34:44.691 --> 34:47.781
You'll have to recuse yourself,
you know.

34:47.824 --> 34:50.610
Otherwise it will look like
you're using the county's

34:50.653 --> 34:53.308
resources for a personal
vendetta against my family.

34:53.352 --> 34:55.310
It's not
about our families, Liam.

34:55.354 --> 34:57.965
It's about exposing the truth.

35:20.335 --> 35:22.511
Okay, on a scale of one to ten,

35:22.555 --> 35:24.078
how mad are you
at me?

35:24.122 --> 35:25.732
I'm not mad, Bon.

35:25.775 --> 35:28.387
I'm not even disappointed,
I'm just...

35:30.432 --> 35:32.478
...shaken.

35:34.958 --> 35:37.613
And I see why

35:37.657 --> 35:40.486
you would keep that to yourself
all those years.

35:43.358 --> 35:45.665
And I've

35:45.708 --> 35:47.884
kept something to myself

35:47.928 --> 35:50.148
for a long time, too.

35:56.197 --> 35:58.156
Marv came to me

35:58.199 --> 36:01.681
a day or two before the fire.

36:01.724 --> 36:04.597
And he told me

36:04.640 --> 36:07.121
that the baby
he and Gale had

36:07.165 --> 36:09.254
that we thought
had died

36:09.297 --> 36:11.952
after being born...

36:11.995 --> 36:13.562
survived.

36:13.606 --> 36:15.695
The baby survived?

36:17.000 --> 36:19.002
The baby had
a medical condition and...

36:19.046 --> 36:21.527
Marv was afraid that
he wouldn't be able to afford

36:21.570 --> 36:24.704
the costs or the emotional toll.

36:24.747 --> 36:28.142
Again,
seeing what they went through

36:28.186 --> 36:30.666
with Denise's heart problems.

36:31.624 --> 36:33.843
So he gave the baby away.

36:36.585 --> 36:38.631
And I told Marv

36:38.674 --> 36:41.416
he needed to let Gale know,
I mean, family talks to family.

36:41.460 --> 36:44.419
But I don't know
if he ever got the chance.

36:46.595 --> 36:49.337
Why are you coming out
about this now?

36:49.381 --> 36:52.427
Well, right after Marv died,
I wanted

36:52.471 --> 36:54.821
to tell Gale.

36:54.864 --> 36:57.258
I'd want to know
if that was my baby.

36:57.302 --> 36:59.782
No.

36:59.826 --> 37:04.309
I meant why are you just coming
out about this to me now?

37:04.352 --> 37:05.962
I don't know.

37:06.006 --> 37:08.356
I got tired...

37:08.400 --> 37:10.924
of carrying it alone, I guess.

37:10.967 --> 37:14.188
You know how that feels.

37:19.411 --> 37:21.630
Well, go ahead.

37:21.674 --> 37:24.285
Yell at me
for not saying anything.

37:30.683 --> 37:32.293
Do you think that...

37:32.337 --> 37:33.686
that's why Marv
came on a tear

37:33.729 --> 37:35.296
about the land
back then?

37:35.340 --> 37:38.952
I mean, I wondered why he
suddenly needed money, but...

37:42.390 --> 37:44.305
Oh, Abby, I wish
you would've told me.

37:44.349 --> 37:45.959
Well, I am not proud

37:46.002 --> 37:47.439
of what I've done.

37:47.482 --> 37:49.745
Or what I didn't do
or didn't say.

37:51.312 --> 37:54.184
But you didn't have
to accept Gale's challenge.

37:54.228 --> 37:57.753
Well, I guess it's too late
for that now, isn't it?

38:07.197 --> 38:09.417
Well, I guess it is.

38:19.949 --> 38:21.473
It's a nice night.

38:23.910 --> 38:26.521
I-I meant the sky.

38:27.870 --> 38:30.220
Yeah, I mean,
it didn't really,

38:30.264 --> 38:32.135
uh, go down the way

38:32.179 --> 38:35.661
I was hoping tonight would,
would, would turn out.

38:36.966 --> 38:39.099
You're so official.

38:40.318 --> 38:42.798
I'm pretty sure
everyone knows.

38:49.370 --> 38:50.980
Hey.

38:52.242 --> 38:53.940
Please don't forget

38:53.983 --> 38:56.159
all of the years
that I have been here

38:56.203 --> 38:58.466
with you as a friend.

39:00.773 --> 39:04.037
Whatever you're facing,
whatever it is,

39:04.080 --> 39:05.952
I'm in your corner.

39:05.995 --> 39:07.954
Okay?

39:16.789 --> 39:19.705
Well, hope Dad and Aunt
Geri aren't a fling.

39:19.748 --> 39:22.447
Also is it weird to keep
saying the whole "aunt" thing?

39:22.490 --> 39:24.362
I don't think they're a fling.

39:24.405 --> 39:25.885
I think they might start
something serious.

39:25.928 --> 39:28.322
Oh, yeah, well,
how do you know?

39:28.366 --> 39:31.020
I just do.
It feels right.

39:31.978 --> 39:34.241
And just to say it,

39:34.284 --> 39:37.984
I think Todd and I might be
getting pretty serious, too.

39:56.568 --> 39:58.526
Oh, you're quiet
as a church mouse, Geraldine.

39:58.570 --> 40:00.398
You about gave me a stroke.

40:00.441 --> 40:01.964
Sorry, Bon.
I'm sure you had

40:02.008 --> 40:03.923
more than enough
surprises tonight.

40:03.966 --> 40:04.793
Oh, my goodness.

40:04.837 --> 40:06.882
- I guess so.
- Yeah.

40:06.926 --> 40:09.450
Sure was nice seeing you and
Cordell getting cozy though.

40:09.494 --> 40:11.365
Yeah.

40:13.149 --> 40:15.500
He's, uh, he's...

40:15.543 --> 40:17.806
he's out there
training for the race.

40:17.850 --> 40:20.766
Probably trying
- to process it all.
- Yeah.

40:20.809 --> 40:22.420
Well, night ride's good
for thinking.

40:22.463 --> 40:23.769
There's no distractions.

40:23.812 --> 40:24.944
Yeah.

40:24.987 --> 40:26.685
We should've been
celebrating your future

40:26.728 --> 40:29.470
though, not digging up the past.

40:29.514 --> 40:31.646
Well...

40:31.690 --> 40:33.387
for what it's worth,

40:33.431 --> 40:35.476
I do admire your cowboy spirit.

40:35.520 --> 40:38.087
How you take care of
your land, your home.

40:38.131 --> 40:40.481
You always have.

40:40.525 --> 40:43.658
Reminds me of my dad.

40:43.702 --> 40:46.400
Always family first.

40:47.314 --> 40:49.664
Just trying to do right by kin.

40:50.752 --> 40:53.451
We do what's best...

40:55.148 --> 40:58.499
Yeah, Cordell's probably
gonna be a while.

40:58.543 --> 41:00.632
You should probably get
some shut-eye.

41:01.459 --> 41:03.373
Okay.

41:03.417 --> 41:05.419
All right, good night.

41:05.463 --> 41:06.681
All right, good night,
darling.

41:06.725 --> 41:08.553
- Sweet dreams.
- Yeah.
