00:06.250 --> 00:07.460
Raven:
Raven's Home was filmed

00:07.460 --> 00:09.920
in front of a live
studio audience.

00:09.920 --> 00:13.250
Winged liner, bold lip,
and a pop of color on the lid.

00:13.250 --> 00:15.580
We are slaying
this online makeup tutorial.

00:15.580 --> 00:17.420
Yo, I look like
my older sister.

00:18.920 --> 00:20.000
You don't have
an older sister.

00:20.000 --> 00:22.460
But if I did, this is
what she'd look like.

00:23.500 --> 00:24.540
Raven:
Nia?

00:24.540 --> 00:25.710
It's my mom.

00:28.500 --> 00:29.250
Hey, y'all.

00:30.460 --> 00:32.170
-Hey, Mom.
-What up, Ms. B?

00:32.170 --> 00:34.330
(clears throat)
What y'all doing?

00:34.330 --> 00:36.380
-Nia: Nothing.
-Oh, really?

00:36.380 --> 00:37.420
Hmm.
Turn around.

00:41.920 --> 00:44.290
Oh, you're funny. Okay, let
me see what's happening.

00:47.080 --> 00:49.040
All right, well, you know,
I'm just gonna...

00:49.040 --> 00:51.380
Just do a little--
Oh, gotcha!

00:53.710 --> 00:56.210
Uh, what have I told you
about playing in my makeup?

00:56.210 --> 00:57.790
That it's too expensive.

00:57.790 --> 00:59.290
And looking good ain't cheap,
and looking cheap ain't good.

01:00.750 --> 01:03.040
I don't know who you're
imitating, but she's right.

01:04.080 --> 01:05.500
Then let me buy my own.

01:05.500 --> 01:07.210
A lot of girls
at school wear makeup.

01:07.210 --> 01:09.000
-Well, I'm not their mama.
-But you're not my mom.

01:09.000 --> 01:11.250
Yeah, so why are you always
in my refrigerator?

01:14.290 --> 01:16.710
Nia, I told you a thousand times,
you're too young for makeup.

01:16.710 --> 01:18.920
Listen, I totally
hear you, Ms. B.

01:18.920 --> 01:21.330
But for real,
we look slammin', right?

01:24.380 --> 01:27.420
Nia, you need
to wipe your face.

01:27.420 --> 01:29.330
Tess, I'm gonna get you
a rag and a bucket.

(laughter)

02:22.460 --> 02:25.040
Levi, step it up
in the bathroom!

02:25.040 --> 02:26.460
You're 45 pounds.

02:26.460 --> 02:29.000
Ain't a lot of landscape
to manscape in there.

02:32.500 --> 02:33.580
Levi:
Ow!

02:37.330 --> 02:38.380
What are you
still doing in bed?

02:38.380 --> 02:41.460
I don't wanna go to school.

02:41.460 --> 02:44.040
I'm gonna tell you what my mama told
me when I was in the fourth grade.

02:45.040 --> 02:46.750
Booker, get out of bed
and go to school!

02:50.290 --> 02:51.620
Talk to me.
What's going on?

02:51.620 --> 02:53.960
We're playing
dodgeball in PE.

02:53.960 --> 02:56.000
Lucky! I love dodgeball.

02:56.000 --> 02:57.250
Well, I hate it.

02:57.250 --> 02:58.380
I'm always the first one out.

02:58.380 --> 03:00.420
Well, there's your problem
right there.

03:00.420 --> 03:02.250
You're supposed to be
the last one out.

03:04.880 --> 03:06.120
Fixed it. Let's go.

03:07.460 --> 03:08.500
It's not that easy.

03:08.500 --> 03:09.710
I'm the new kid.

03:09.710 --> 03:11.380
No one even wants me
on their team.

03:11.380 --> 03:13.290
Well, if you were
in my gym class,

03:13.290 --> 03:14.460
I'd pick you first.

03:16.500 --> 03:17.580
Well, not first.

03:17.580 --> 03:20.000
First, I'd pick
Anthony Camuso.

03:20.000 --> 03:21.460
Oh, then Jenny Rogers.

03:21.460 --> 03:23.120
Then Jill Chu.

03:23.120 --> 03:25.250
Then Wheels.
Then Kenneth Miley.

03:26.500 --> 03:27.460
Then you.

03:32.290 --> 03:34.620
Hey, Chels, I just want to let you
know, I have to work late tonight.

03:34.620 --> 03:36.210
-Again?
-Yeah.

03:36.210 --> 03:37.380
Listen, making dog clothes

03:37.380 --> 03:39.420
is just as difficult
as making people clothes,

03:39.420 --> 03:41.580
except there's less money
and more leg holes.

03:43.500 --> 03:46.460
Rae, you are so talented.
I really think one day,

03:46.460 --> 03:48.420
-you're gonna have your
own design studio. -Yeah.

03:48.420 --> 03:50.380
I'm even getting choked up
just thinking about it.

03:50.380 --> 03:51.790
(laughing)

03:51.790 --> 03:53.920
Also, I think I swallowed
a little bit of toothpaste.

03:53.920 --> 03:54.960
(coughs)

03:54.960 --> 03:56.170
Morning, Aunt Chels.

03:56.170 --> 03:57.290
Morning, Nia.

03:57.290 --> 04:00.120
-Hi, Mom. You look beautiful today.
-Hi.

04:00.120 --> 04:02.290
Is that makeup
you're wearing?

04:02.290 --> 04:04.920
-Forget it.
-But, Mom--

04:04.920 --> 04:07.620
Listen, you are too young
to wear makeup.

04:09.170 --> 04:11.210
I think I'm old enough
to make my own decisions.

04:12.670 --> 04:14.420
This conversation is over.

04:14.420 --> 04:15.790
If I catch you
wearing makeup,

04:15.790 --> 04:18.620
you gonna get it.

04:18.620 --> 04:23.250
Now, please, I have to put a size 12
beagle into a size six wedding dress.

04:23.250 --> 04:25.250
Do not be the most
challenging part of my day.

04:37.500 --> 04:39.460
I can't believe you took
makeup from your mom.

04:39.460 --> 04:41.460
All this time, I thought
I was the bad influence.

04:41.460 --> 04:43.080
Turns out, it's you.

04:44.460 --> 04:46.380
I'm only in trouble
if she catches me.

04:46.380 --> 04:48.750
Besides, if I'm too young
for eyeliner,

04:48.750 --> 04:50.210
why am I so good at it?

04:51.290 --> 04:53.830
That's exactly
how I feel about driving.

04:55.290 --> 04:57.120
I'm not a little kid anymore.

04:57.120 --> 04:58.330
When is my mom
gonna realize that?

05:01.080 --> 05:02.960
Nia, don't freak out.

05:02.960 --> 05:04.500
Shannon Reynolds
is coming over.

05:04.500 --> 05:05.380
Yeah, right.

05:05.380 --> 05:07.420
Shannon Reynolds is
the coolest eighth grader.

05:07.420 --> 05:09.420
She doesn't even
know we exist.

05:09.420 --> 05:11.290
Hey, would you
sign my petition?

05:11.290 --> 05:14.120
It's so the eighth graders can attend
next month's climate change rally.

05:14.120 --> 05:16.080
(laughs)
We can't.

05:16.080 --> 05:17.120
We're only in sixth.

05:17.120 --> 05:18.500
You're kidding?

05:18.500 --> 05:20.460
Wow. I thought
you guys were older.

05:20.460 --> 05:22.210
Nia, it's the makeup.

05:22.210 --> 05:24.540
You're eye-lining
on an eighth grade level.

05:26.040 --> 05:28.460
I love your eye shadow.
What shade is it?

05:28.460 --> 05:30.790
It's actually
a couple different ones.

05:30.790 --> 05:31.880
I blended them.

05:31.880 --> 05:34.170
You have to show me
how you did that.

05:34.170 --> 05:36.670
I'll go grab my makeup.
Meet me in the bathroom.

05:38.330 --> 05:40.790
-Shannon Reynolds just asked
you to do her makeup. -I know.

05:40.790 --> 05:43.830
She's like the Beyoncé
of our school!

05:43.830 --> 05:46.960
I know! I heard her vision
board was just a mirror.

05:46.960 --> 05:48.290
'Cause she's already there.

05:50.250 --> 05:52.040
Nia, do not mess this up.

05:52.040 --> 05:54.500
This is our big chance
to seem better than we are.

05:54.500 --> 05:56.330
For some reason,
that's important to me.

06:01.380 --> 06:02.790
-Hey, Rae.
-Oh, hey, Chels.

06:02.790 --> 06:04.120
What are you doing here?

06:04.120 --> 06:05.920
Well, since you've been
working so hard,

06:05.920 --> 06:07.830
-I thought I'd make you lunch.
-Oh?

06:07.830 --> 06:09.290
But then I burned it, so...

06:11.170 --> 06:13.460
So, I thought
I'd take us out to lunch.

06:13.460 --> 06:15.460
But then,
I forgot my wallet.

06:16.790 --> 06:18.330
So you want me
to take us to lunch?

06:18.330 --> 06:20.000
Thanks, Rae.

06:22.380 --> 06:24.040
So, you're Chelsea?

06:24.040 --> 06:25.460
Nice to finally meet you.

06:27.540 --> 06:30.500
I wish you had brought Booker and
Nia so I could meet them too.

06:30.500 --> 06:32.670
No, no, no, she can't...
She can't do that.

06:32.670 --> 06:35.290
Uh, can I talk to... Can I talk
to my friend for a second?

06:37.580 --> 06:39.960
Paisley thinks that Booker
and Nia are my puppies.

06:39.960 --> 06:41.790
What? Why would
she think that?

06:41.790 --> 06:43.670
Okay, so when I was interviewing for
this job, I had to compete against

06:43.670 --> 06:45.830
some 20-something-year-olds straight
out of design school, right?

06:45.830 --> 06:47.710
So I needed
the upper edge.

06:47.710 --> 06:51.120
Now, I knew
Paisley liked dogs,

06:51.120 --> 06:52.540
so, you know,
I brought up Booker and Nia.

06:52.540 --> 06:55.250
I didn't say they were dogs.
I just let her assume.

06:57.120 --> 07:00.250
Okay, well, now
you can tell her the truth.

07:00.250 --> 07:01.580
(laughing)
No, no.

07:01.580 --> 07:03.290
No, I'm not gonna do that.

07:03.290 --> 07:05.460
See, because if I do, and she
finds out I've been lying,

07:05.460 --> 07:06.580
I could get fired.

07:06.580 --> 07:08.920
-Okay, you can count on me.
-Thank you.

07:08.920 --> 07:10.040
(phone ringing)

07:10.040 --> 07:11.580
Just a second.

07:14.210 --> 07:16.380
I can't believe Raven's
worked here for three years,

07:16.380 --> 07:18.000
and I've never
met her puppies.

07:18.000 --> 07:21.580
(gasps) Oh, my gosh!
I just had the best idea.

07:21.580 --> 07:24.040
You could go out of your
way to bring them by.

07:25.170 --> 07:26.710
No, no. No, she can't.

07:26.710 --> 07:27.830
No, she's busy.

07:27.830 --> 07:30.040
And that was, uh...
That was the school.

07:30.040 --> 07:31.460
That was
the obedience school...

07:31.460 --> 07:33.420
(clears throat)
...that the babies are in,

07:33.420 --> 07:34.500
and they're sick.

07:34.500 --> 07:35.670
-Paisley.
-(gasping)

07:35.670 --> 07:37.670
They ate some bad cat.

07:39.290 --> 07:41.710
Raven,
you shouldn't be here.

07:41.710 --> 07:43.670
You should go home
and take care of your babies.

07:43.670 --> 07:45.580
I should. I should,
but who's gonna...

07:45.580 --> 07:47.000
Who's gonna
finish the gowns?

07:47.000 --> 07:49.380
Raven, I'm here.

07:49.380 --> 07:50.670
I really don't mind...

07:50.670 --> 07:51.960
making Jessica do it.

08:00.170 --> 08:01.420
-Hey, Booker.
-(screams)

08:03.380 --> 08:04.670
I don't wanna go
to gym class.

08:04.670 --> 08:08.330
Levi, get out of there.

08:08.330 --> 08:09.380
What's up with you?

08:09.380 --> 08:10.960
I can't go to PE.

08:10.960 --> 08:13.080
I've been at this
school for a month,

08:13.080 --> 08:15.170
and all the other kids
just ignore me.

08:15.170 --> 08:17.460
Okay, listen,
here's what you do.

08:17.460 --> 08:18.830
You go into dodgeball

08:18.830 --> 08:20.920
and take out the biggest
kid in the class.

08:20.920 --> 08:22.120
Then everyone
will know your name.

08:22.120 --> 08:23.290
You really believe that?

08:23.290 --> 08:25.620
Of course. I believe
everything I say.

08:26.960 --> 08:28.380
Now, get in there.

08:28.380 --> 08:29.420
It's gonna be great.

08:32.420 --> 08:35.290
(whooshing)

08:38.500 --> 08:39.960
No!

08:44.120 --> 08:46.170
They're gonna destroy Levi.

08:46.170 --> 08:47.380
It's all my fault.

08:47.380 --> 08:50.040
Why am I so inspirational?

08:54.960 --> 08:57.420
Nia, girl, my eye makeup
looks awesome.

08:57.420 --> 08:58.920
It's so cool that your
mom lets you do this.

08:58.920 --> 09:00.500
Well, she doesn't
exactly let me,

09:00.500 --> 09:02.540
but I'm in sixth grade now.

09:02.540 --> 09:05.210
So, I said, "Mom, you can't
tell me what to do."

09:05.210 --> 09:06.250
You said that?

09:06.250 --> 09:08.290
Oh, yeah.
Real loud.

09:08.290 --> 09:09.330
In my head.

09:09.330 --> 09:10.460
(laughing)

09:10.460 --> 09:12.920
Hey, you and your friend wanna
hang out with us after school?

09:12.920 --> 09:14.170
Yes!

09:14.170 --> 09:15.540
I mean,
I'll think about it.

09:15.540 --> 09:16.920
I thought about it. Yes!

09:18.710 --> 09:21.080
Uh, hey, Book.
Where are you going?

09:21.080 --> 09:22.420
We don't have
PE right now.

09:22.420 --> 09:24.920
I'm going to save Levi's butt.

09:24.920 --> 09:26.330
Wait.

09:26.330 --> 09:28.460
Are you wearing makeup?

09:28.460 --> 09:30.830
Ooh, you gonna get it!

09:38.120 --> 09:39.880
Booker, what are
you doing here?

09:39.880 --> 09:43.500
I had a vision that you were gonna
get destroyed in dodgeball,

09:43.500 --> 09:45.170
so I skipped lunch and rushed
right over to help you.

09:45.170 --> 09:47.290
You have a little sauce
on your face.

09:49.170 --> 09:51.380
Okay, I had a slice of pizza.
Then, I rushed over.

09:52.580 --> 09:54.420
This is fourth-grade gym.

09:54.420 --> 09:56.500
As soon
as Coach Aronson sees you,

09:56.500 --> 09:57.880
he's gonna kick you out.

09:57.880 --> 09:58.960
(whistle trills)

10:06.380 --> 10:09.380
Coach A-ronson is sick.

10:11.170 --> 10:12.920
So I'll be
your sub today.

10:12.920 --> 10:16.080
My name is Coach Spitz.

10:16.080 --> 10:17.380
With a Z.

10:18.580 --> 10:20.330
I know what you're thinking.

10:20.330 --> 10:22.330
"Coach Spitz is just a sub.

10:22.330 --> 10:23.620
"We don't have to respect him.

10:23.620 --> 10:25.830
We can pull
all the nonsense we want."

10:25.830 --> 10:28.000
Well, that's where you're wrong.

10:29.420 --> 10:32.290
Nonsense will not be tolerated.

10:33.750 --> 10:35.380
A sub, this is perfect.

10:35.380 --> 10:37.420
He won't know I'm not
supposed to be in your class.

10:37.420 --> 10:38.620
(whistle trills)

10:38.620 --> 10:40.880
What was that whispering?
Some nonsense?

10:42.540 --> 10:43.750
You're big
for a fourth grader.

10:43.750 --> 10:45.210
You're big for a sub.

10:47.460 --> 10:49.000
I like your style.

10:49.000 --> 10:50.120
What's your name, son?

10:50.120 --> 10:51.670
-Booker.
-Booger?

10:51.670 --> 10:53.750
Why the heck would your folks
give you a crazy name like that?

10:53.750 --> 10:55.790
-It's Booker.
-Don't sass me, Booger.

10:55.790 --> 10:57.540
I'm not the one who named
you after a nose nugget.

10:59.250 --> 11:01.750
Now, get up here.
I'm making you team captain.

11:01.750 --> 11:04.120
Great. You can pick me first.

11:04.120 --> 11:05.420
Then, we'll be
on the same team.

11:05.420 --> 11:07.330
(whistle trills)

11:07.330 --> 11:10.290
Oh, I see! Little Booger
whispers and gets made captain,

11:10.290 --> 11:12.460
and you think it's gonna
work for you.

11:12.460 --> 11:13.960
Well, it did.
You're captain.

11:15.120 --> 11:16.290
What's your name, son?

11:16.290 --> 11:18.170
-Levi.
-Levy, get up here.

11:20.290 --> 11:21.500
We may be
on opposite teams,

11:21.500 --> 11:23.080
but I can still protect you.

11:23.080 --> 11:24.420
Just stay out of the way.

11:24.420 --> 11:25.960
I'll make sure
you don't get hit.

11:27.540 --> 11:28.580
(whistle trills)

11:31.500 --> 11:32.620
-(whistle trills)
-You're out.

11:32.620 --> 11:34.920
Heck of a throw, Booger.
You got real talent.

11:34.920 --> 11:36.250
Thanks, Coach.

11:37.290 --> 11:38.790
-(whistle trills)
-You're out.

11:38.790 --> 11:41.580
You're dominating, son.
You could win this whole thing.

11:43.460 --> 11:45.460
I could win
this whole thing.

11:45.460 --> 11:48.460
Um, you're still protecting me,
right, Booker?

11:48.460 --> 11:49.920
Absolutely, buddy.

11:50.920 --> 11:51.960
You're out!

11:51.960 --> 11:53.380
-(whistle trills)
-Hey!

11:53.380 --> 11:55.080
I'm the one
who says who's out.

11:55.080 --> 11:57.540
But he's right.
You're out.

12:05.500 --> 12:07.080
Woo-wee!
I should have used

12:07.080 --> 12:10.380
that sick dog excuse
with Paisley a long time ago.

12:10.380 --> 12:13.420
Look at us. We had a nice little
lunch, a little mani-pedi.

12:13.420 --> 12:18.170
We filed a formal complaint against
those guys watching us get mani-pedis.

12:19.330 --> 12:21.750
(laughing)
Hey!

12:21.750 --> 12:23.120
(phone ringing)

12:23.120 --> 12:25.420
(gasps) Oh, snap! It's Paisley.

12:25.420 --> 12:27.420
Um, act like a sick dog.

12:27.420 --> 12:29.420
(barks)

12:29.420 --> 12:32.380
(coughing)

12:38.500 --> 12:39.790
Raven, it's me.

12:39.790 --> 12:42.290
I just had a genius idea.

12:42.290 --> 12:43.750
Since Booker and Nia are sick,

12:43.750 --> 12:46.620
I'm gonna bring them the puppy
equivalent of chicken noodle soup.

12:46.620 --> 12:48.420
What's that?

12:48.420 --> 12:50.170
Chicken noodle soup.

12:52.710 --> 12:55.420
I'll be there in 15.
Clean your house.

12:57.920 --> 12:59.330
Chels, this is bad.

12:59.330 --> 13:00.960
If Paisley finds out I don't
have dogs, I could get fired.

13:00.960 --> 13:03.460
I really think it's time
you tell her the truth.

13:03.460 --> 13:06.120
(laughing)

13:07.960 --> 13:09.960
Oh, man!
We're gonna borrow two dogs

13:09.960 --> 13:12.080
and pass them off as
Booker and Nia, aren't we?

13:12.080 --> 13:13.250
You know it.

13:18.790 --> 13:19.880
(Booker screaming)

13:19.880 --> 13:22.080
(screaming continues)

13:31.380 --> 13:34.080
(whistle trilling)

13:44.500 --> 13:45.960
(grunting)

13:45.960 --> 13:47.420
-(whistle trills)
-You're out.

13:47.420 --> 13:49.290
Booger, you keep
playing like that,

13:49.290 --> 13:50.330
you could go pro.

13:50.330 --> 13:52.420
When you do, you're
gonna need a manager.

13:52.420 --> 13:53.330
I'm just saying.

13:56.120 --> 13:57.500
Game over, chumps!

14:00.460 --> 14:01.960
No!

14:03.580 --> 14:05.580
They aren't gonna
destroy Levi.

14:05.580 --> 14:06.580
I am.

14:07.880 --> 14:09.040
Finish him.

14:09.040 --> 14:11.330
Finish him.

14:11.330 --> 14:12.420
No.

14:12.420 --> 14:14.880
No, I won't do it.

14:14.880 --> 14:16.380
Levi is my brother.

14:16.380 --> 14:19.460
I admit. I was blinded by my
own awesomeness for a minute,

14:19.460 --> 14:22.080
but... I came here
to protect him,

14:22.080 --> 14:23.880
and that's what
I'm gonna do.

14:23.880 --> 14:25.330
I won!

14:25.330 --> 14:27.460
-(whistle trills)
-(cheering)

14:27.460 --> 14:28.920
What the heck?

14:28.920 --> 14:31.420
I took out
the biggest kid.

14:32.880 --> 14:34.710
I really thought you could
have been something, Booger.

14:43.500 --> 14:45.540
I can't believe
Shannon asked us to sit

14:45.540 --> 14:47.290
at the eighth grade table
for lunch!

14:47.290 --> 14:49.330
Did you even know
there was a secret menu?

14:49.330 --> 14:50.420
I didn't.

14:50.420 --> 14:53.040
Who knew you could get
the meatloaf with real meat?

14:53.040 --> 14:54.210
-It's usually all loaf.
-Right.

14:55.580 --> 14:56.620
What's up, ladies?

14:56.620 --> 14:57.960
-Hey.
-'Sup?

14:57.960 --> 15:00.540
-So, what's the plan after school?
-There isn't one.

15:00.540 --> 15:02.580
The coffee shop where we
usually hang out is closed,

15:02.580 --> 15:04.710
so we don't really have
anywhere to go.

15:04.710 --> 15:06.290
Maybe some other time.

15:07.620 --> 15:09.040
Nia, do something.

15:09.040 --> 15:10.620
I got a taste for the good life.
I can't go back!

15:10.620 --> 15:11.670
Okay.

15:11.670 --> 15:13.000
Uh, wait.

15:14.080 --> 15:15.540
Um...

15:15.540 --> 15:17.290
We could hang out on the
roof deck of our building.

15:17.290 --> 15:18.460
Seriously?

15:18.460 --> 15:20.920
Nia, you are, like,
the coolest sixth grader ever.

15:22.120 --> 15:24.290
Yo, you didn't even
ask your mom.

15:24.290 --> 15:27.330
If she catches you in makeup,
you're gonna get it.

15:28.500 --> 15:30.080
I'm proud of you for not
thinking this one through.

15:30.080 --> 15:31.670
Yeah.

15:31.670 --> 15:33.960
Tess, we're old enough
to make our own decisions.

15:33.960 --> 15:36.380
Besides, it's just Shannon,
her squad, and us.

15:36.380 --> 15:37.670
It's no big deal.

15:37.670 --> 15:40.710
Thanks for letting me
invite a few extra people.

15:40.710 --> 15:43.330
(pop music playing)

15:43.330 --> 15:44.380
No problem.

15:45.790 --> 15:47.620
Tess, we're sixth graders

15:47.620 --> 15:49.920
throwing the biggest
eighth-grade party of the year.

15:49.920 --> 15:51.500
This is awesome.

15:51.500 --> 15:53.500
And none of this would have
happened if we hadn't worn makeup.

15:53.500 --> 15:55.170
Squad pic!

16:03.460 --> 16:05.460
You're telling me
these are the twins?

16:05.460 --> 16:07.040
(whines)

16:08.380 --> 16:10.120
Yes, yes.
This is Nia,

16:10.120 --> 16:11.830
and this is Booker, my babies.

16:13.250 --> 16:15.920
I thought you said that was
Nia, and that was Booker.

16:15.920 --> 16:18.250
Paisley, I see love,

16:18.250 --> 16:19.330
not breed.

16:21.290 --> 16:22.540
What a gorgeous boy.

16:22.540 --> 16:24.790
Hi, Booker.

16:24.790 --> 16:25.880
Does he shake?

16:25.880 --> 16:26.920
No, no,
he's not into tricks.

16:28.580 --> 16:30.330
Some days.
Some days, he shakes.

16:30.330 --> 16:31.960
Just, just watch them.

16:32.960 --> 16:34.960
Okay, we have to get
Paisley out of here.

16:34.960 --> 16:37.620
Mr. Farley in 1B says
he wants his dog back by 3:30.

16:37.620 --> 16:40.250
Okay, well, we only have 45
minutes with the chihuahua.

16:40.250 --> 16:42.750
I found her tied to a parking meter,
and I didn't have any change.

16:44.460 --> 16:46.380
Paisley, you know what? Thank
you so much for the soup,

16:46.380 --> 16:48.620
but I think you should go. I know
you got a lot of stuff going on.

16:48.620 --> 16:50.170
Actually, I don't.

16:50.170 --> 16:51.540
I work
my employees really hard,

16:51.540 --> 16:53.420
so I have plenty
of free time.

16:54.380 --> 16:55.420
You get it.

16:55.420 --> 16:57.000
Yeah, I get it.

16:57.000 --> 16:58.120
(phone ringing)

16:58.120 --> 16:59.380
(barking)

16:59.380 --> 17:01.460
-(phone ringing)
-(dog barking)

17:01.460 --> 17:03.120
Booker! Booker, stop!

17:03.120 --> 17:04.620
I think
it's your ringtone.

17:04.620 --> 17:06.380
(sighs) Hello?

17:06.380 --> 17:07.880
(whispering)
Hey, Mr. Farley.

17:07.880 --> 17:10.500
Oh. Oh, your dog freaks out
when the phone rings?

17:10.500 --> 17:12.620
You should have told me that
in a text, bruh.

17:15.170 --> 17:16.210
(dog barking)

17:17.580 --> 17:20.250
I can't believe I got so caught
up in that dodgeball game

17:20.250 --> 17:22.040
that I almost took you out.

17:22.040 --> 17:23.210
But then I took you out.

17:23.210 --> 17:25.210
Okay, okay. We all
know what happened.

17:26.750 --> 17:28.330
Thanks for helping me, Booker.

17:28.330 --> 17:30.210
Everyone was talking to me.

17:30.210 --> 17:32.290
And I got so many high fives,

17:32.290 --> 17:34.080
I had to start
going lefty.

17:35.710 --> 17:37.040
You're right.

17:37.040 --> 17:38.500
I guess I am a hero.

17:38.500 --> 17:40.000
Well, I didn't say that.

17:41.120 --> 17:42.420
You didn't have to.

17:44.420 --> 17:46.000
Oh! Wait! Wait!

17:46.000 --> 17:47.330
Oh, no!
Oh, no!

17:47.330 --> 17:48.880
-(screaming)
-(barking)

17:48.880 --> 17:50.710
Wait! Wait!
Booker, get back here!

17:50.710 --> 17:52.040
(clattering)

17:52.040 --> 17:53.120
Raven:
Booker, stop!

17:53.120 --> 17:55.380
Raven:
Booker, drop it!

17:55.380 --> 17:57.000
Raven:
Booker, sit!

17:59.210 --> 18:00.290
What are you doing?

18:00.290 --> 18:02.620
I don't know.
She's using her command voice.

18:03.960 --> 18:05.460
-(dog barking)
-Raven: Oh! (grunts)

18:05.460 --> 18:07.120
-Mom, what's going on?
-(clattering)

18:07.120 --> 18:10.670
Hey, hey, if you stop asking questions
and hide under the coffee table,

18:10.670 --> 18:12.000
I'll give you cookies.

18:12.000 --> 18:13.380
How many?

18:13.380 --> 18:15.880
That's a question.
Don't blow this.

18:24.750 --> 18:28.500
Raven, I'm so glad
I finally got to meet the twins.

18:28.500 --> 18:30.250
But I have a confession.

18:30.250 --> 18:31.540
That's not
the only reason I'm here.

18:31.540 --> 18:33.420
Oh, no. You don't wanna
be friends too, do you?

18:35.000 --> 18:36.960
No. I was
checking out your house.

18:36.960 --> 18:39.000
There's clearly
a lot of love here,

18:39.000 --> 18:41.710
which is why I'm gonna let you puppy-sit
for me while I'm out of town.

18:41.710 --> 18:42.880
Say what?

18:42.880 --> 18:44.830
Don't worry.
It's only for the summer...

18:44.830 --> 18:45.880
and part of the fall.

18:45.880 --> 18:46.880
Bye.

18:50.380 --> 18:51.540
Well, that's karma.

18:51.540 --> 18:54.960
What? I've been calling her
Paisley, like, this whole time.

19:00.380 --> 19:02.460
(music playing)

19:02.460 --> 19:04.330
Nia, that DJ is fire!

19:04.330 --> 19:08.040
This is the best party
we've ever accidentally thrown.

19:08.040 --> 19:10.540
Yeah, but my mom
will be home soon.

19:10.540 --> 19:12.960
If she catches me in this
makeup, she'll kill me.

19:12.960 --> 19:15.330
I'm just gonna ask Shannon how
much longer she wants to hang out.

19:15.330 --> 19:17.290
All right, but make sure
it's at least 20 minutes.

19:17.290 --> 19:19.380
I just requested five songs.

19:21.460 --> 19:22.500
Hey, Shannon.

19:22.500 --> 19:25.420
You gonna get it.

19:30.120 --> 19:32.420
You gonna get it.

19:35.210 --> 19:37.460
Hey, party people,
I know you with it!

19:37.460 --> 19:41.210
Here's a new song called
"You Gonna Get It."

19:44.170 --> 19:46.290
Tess, we have to get
everybody out of here.

19:47.330 --> 19:51.380
Girl, you gonna get it.

19:51.380 --> 19:55.500
(screaming)

19:55.500 --> 19:57.790
Time to get you back
to Mr. Farley.

19:57.790 --> 19:59.710
-(music thumping)
-Hey!

19:59.710 --> 20:03.420
Who's having a party in the middle
of the afternoon, on a Tuesday...

20:03.420 --> 20:06.210
and not invite me?

20:06.210 --> 20:07.620
(phone ringing)

20:07.620 --> 20:09.000
-(dog barking)
-(gasps) Uh-oh!

20:09.000 --> 20:10.290
-(dog barking)
-No!

20:10.290 --> 20:11.460
(Raven groaning)

20:11.460 --> 20:14.420
Ow! (exclaiming)

20:14.420 --> 20:16.830
I'm fine. I'm fine.
I'm okay. I'm okay.

20:18.290 --> 20:19.920
What are y'all doing
on my roof?

20:19.920 --> 20:21.830
It's cool.
Nia invited us.

20:21.830 --> 20:23.460
My Nia?
Oh, she did?

20:23.460 --> 20:26.500
Well, I'm her mama, and I'm
uninviting you! Get out!

20:29.670 --> 20:30.710
Come here.

20:33.580 --> 20:34.580
Get... out.

20:38.420 --> 20:39.380
Are you wearing makeup?

20:40.380 --> 20:43.540
Ooh, girl,
you about to get it.

20:45.670 --> 20:46.710
(phone ringing)

20:46.710 --> 20:47.880
Uh-oh!

20:47.880 --> 20:49.540
-(dog barking)
-(screaming)

20:55.040 --> 20:56.790
Yo, when you guys
get a dog?

21:09.170 --> 21:10.330
You had quite a day.

21:11.790 --> 21:14.290
I don't know
what got into me.

21:14.290 --> 21:16.420
Things just got
so out of control.

21:17.500 --> 21:19.120
I shouldn't have
taken that makeup,

21:19.120 --> 21:20.790
and I shouldn't have
worn it to school.

21:20.790 --> 21:22.330
You right.
You shouldn't have.

21:25.120 --> 21:26.120
Nia,

21:27.120 --> 21:28.380
like, what were you thinking?

21:30.040 --> 21:31.040
I wasn't.

21:32.330 --> 21:33.330
I liked the way it looked,

21:33.330 --> 21:35.250
and suddenly, eighth graders
started talking to me.

21:37.330 --> 21:39.210
I guess I just liked
feeling grown-up.

21:41.040 --> 21:43.830
So, you know
it's the way you act

21:43.830 --> 21:47.500
and the decisions you make
that make you mature,

21:47.500 --> 21:49.290
not the makeup you wear.

21:49.290 --> 21:50.880
Yeah.

21:50.880 --> 21:53.250
And you're beautiful. You don't
need all that stuff on your face.

21:53.250 --> 21:55.830
Well, you're beautiful,
and you wear makeup.

21:55.830 --> 21:58.620
Yeah, but I'm old,
I got kids, and I'm tired.

22:00.290 --> 22:01.330
But I get it.

22:01.330 --> 22:02.960
It's really difficult out there.

22:02.960 --> 22:05.170
There's a lot of pressure to
make us a look a certain way.

22:05.170 --> 22:06.580
It's coming from all angles.

22:06.580 --> 22:08.620
I get it. You get it. I get it.

22:08.620 --> 22:11.330
But it's my job
to keep reminding you

22:11.330 --> 22:13.290
that you're beautiful
just the way you are.

22:14.330 --> 22:16.120
And I'm gonna keep
reminding you.

22:16.120 --> 22:18.290
Oh, thank you.
I love you.

22:18.290 --> 22:19.380
I love you, Mom.

22:19.380 --> 22:21.830
All right, come on.

22:21.830 --> 22:23.750
(sighs, clears throat)

22:26.170 --> 22:27.460
You know
you're grounded, right?

22:27.460 --> 22:28.880
Yeah, I know.

22:28.880 --> 22:30.880
For what, three weeks?

22:30.880 --> 22:33.960
I was gonna say two, but I think you're
old enough to make your own decisions.

22:38.380 --> 22:41.290
Whoo! I am glad
this crazy day is over, girl.

22:41.290 --> 22:43.460
Yeah, I just... I feel like
we're forgetting something.

22:43.460 --> 22:46.710
No, no, grounded Nia.
Saved my job.

22:46.710 --> 22:47.830
Taco Tuesday.

22:49.330 --> 22:51.250
What else is there?

22:51.250 --> 22:54.080
I don't know. I just feel like there
were a lot of extra tacos tonight.

22:54.080 --> 22:55.920
Oh, well.
I guess it's not important.

22:59.080 --> 23:01.880
How long do we have to stay under
here before we get our cookies?

23:03.620 --> 23:06.620
You heard my mom.
No questions.

23:08.290 --> 23:11.210
Man, these cookies
are gonna be sweet!
