<i>SCHMIDT: Hey, Elizabeth,
what are we doing tonight?</i>

00:04.422 --> 00:05.622
<i>ELIZABETH (over phone): Dexter and pie.</i>

00:05.656 --> 00:06.856
<i>SCHMIDT: Girl, you treat me right.</i>

00:06.891 --> 00:09.025
Hey, there she is,

00:09.060 --> 00:10.660
my one and only.

00:11.729 --> 00:13.196
Oh, thank God, coffee.

00:13.230 --> 00:15.799
- I barely slept last night.
- Yeah, me, too.

00:15.833 --> 00:17.300
I think I passed out for, like, 25 minutes

00:17.334 --> 00:18.768
when you jammed that sock down my throat.

00:18.803 --> 00:21.104
- I aim to please.
- JESS: Aw...

00:21.138 --> 00:22.639
Hey, why don't we all go on a double date?

00:22.673 --> 00:24.140
What are you guys doing tonight?

00:24.175 --> 00:25.141
Yeah.

00:25.176 --> 00:26.609
- Tonight?
- Yeah.

00:26.644 --> 00:28.144
- Today's tonight?
- Yeah.

00:28.179 --> 00:30.046
Tonight... meaning changes
every day, doesn't it?

00:30.081 --> 00:31.281
JESS: Come on, Schmidt.

00:31.315 --> 00:32.281
I'm sure he's got other plans.

00:32.316 --> 00:33.283
You've got other plans, right?

00:33.317 --> 00:35.285
Plans? Not me.

00:35.319 --> 00:36.386
I don't even... I mean...

00:36.420 --> 00:37.420
Yeah!

00:37.455 --> 00:38.922

00:48.299 --> 00:50.233
the energy here, but yeah,
I mean, it sounds great.

00:50.267 --> 00:53.103
Hey, you want to split that
pasta from last night, hmm?

01:00.788 --> 01:02.155
Got nothing but love for you.

01:02.189 --> 01:05.158
Go ahead, chill out, man,
I'll make you some coffee.

01:07.161 --> 01:09.295
What?

01:09.330 --> 01:11.931
So what are y'all talking
about, going on dates?

01:13.534 --> 01:14.767
Oh, y'all are talking about that.

01:14.802 --> 01:16.703
Okay, cool.

01:16.737 --> 01:18.438
Nobody invited me.

01:18.472 --> 01:19.639
Is it 'cause I'm single?

01:19.673 --> 01:22.809
I mean, I... I know I'm single.

01:22.843 --> 01:24.277
I'm okay with it.

01:24.311 --> 01:26.246
It was a choice that I made...

01:26.280 --> 01:28.314
as a man... to be alone.

01:28.349 --> 01:29.782
Don't nobody know you like you,

01:29.817 --> 01:33.286
so I'm... I'm choosing
to know myself, who I am.

01:33.320 --> 01:35.788
And if that's okay with
you all, can I come?

01:35.823 --> 01:37.323
All right, where should
we go tonight, you guys?

01:37.358 --> 01:38.424
What about that new spot Picca?

01:38.459 --> 01:40.026
A day-of rezzie at Picca?

01:40.060 --> 01:42.295
You guys don't think I can do it, huh?

01:42.329 --> 01:43.963
Well, funk that.

01:43.998 --> 01:46.099
Bishop can get a table at a chair store.

01:46.133 --> 01:47.333
JESS: Well, that's it, then.

01:47.368 --> 01:48.334
Double date plus one!

01:48.369 --> 01:49.736
You know what would be nuts?

01:49.770 --> 01:52.672
If I brought my cat Furguson as a date.

Hey, listen.

02:18.599 --> 02:19.832
(quiet crackling)

02:19.867 --> 02:21.301
What is that sound?

02:21.335 --> 02:23.136
Sounds like a gravel driveway in there.

02:23.170 --> 02:24.537
Seventh grade.

02:24.571 --> 02:27.206
Pumping my fist too

(knocking at door)

Go away!

02:30.177 --> 02:31.611
Hey, Jess, can you talk? Oh.

02:31.645 --> 02:33.546
Yeah, yeah, totally. How'd I get so lucky?

02:33.580 --> 02:34.681
My bro and my ho.

02:34.715 --> 02:36.015
My penis... it's gonna be exposed.

02:36.050 --> 02:37.250
It's okay, just cover up.

02:37.284 --> 02:38.851
Okay, no, but I don't feel comfortable.

02:38.886 --> 02:40.687
- It's about Schmidt.
- Okay, I'm not involved in this at all.

02:40.721 --> 02:42.455
Hiding from the world.

02:42.489 --> 02:44.157
You can't see me, I can't see you.

02:44.191 --> 02:45.725
I know this sounds totally paranoid,

02:45.759 --> 02:47.960
but I think he's on drugs.

02:47.995 --> 02:49.996
(laughing): Schmidt on drugs?

02:50.030 --> 02:52.999
Okay, not getting involved starting now.

02:53.033 --> 02:54.133
JESS: I'm with Nick here.

02:54.168 --> 02:55.501
You remember how hard he took it

02:55.536 --> 02:56.803
when Lance got busted.

02:56.837 --> 02:58.404
He just stared at that
yellow bracelet and cried.

02:58.439 --> 02:59.906
I know you're right, but...

02:59.940 --> 03:01.240
- You're coming in?
- ... It's just like he's had

03:01.275 --> 03:03.242
this crazy energy lately.

03:03.277 --> 03:05.244
And did you see how insane he was

03:05.279 --> 03:07.380
when we were talking about the double date?

03:07.414 --> 03:09.482
Also, he has just, like, stopped blinking.

03:09.516 --> 03:11.351
- Is that whippits?
- Well, Nick can talk to him.

03:11.385 --> 03:13.252
No, I'm not gonna talk to
him. I called that I wasn't

03:13.287 --> 03:14.721
gonna be involved; those
calls have to be respected.

03:14.755 --> 03:17.056
If you talk to him, I'll give you a treat.

03:17.091 --> 03:18.725
Bedroom treat or kitchen treat?

03:18.759 --> 03:21.327
(Southern accent): Oh,
I'm just a country lawyer

03:21.362 --> 03:24.330
and I have a very, very itchy bra.

03:24.365 --> 03:25.998
(Southern accent): Well,
perhaps I can get underneath.

03:26.033 --> 03:27.667
I've got worker's hands.

03:27.701 --> 03:29.402
JESS: It's very itchy

03:29.436 --> 03:31.437
in so many different little places.

03:31.472 --> 03:33.706
- Let me see.
- (both laugh)

03:33.741 --> 03:35.074
You guys are being really,
really gross right now.

03:35.109 --> 03:36.843
I keep forgetting you're in here.

03:36.877 --> 03:38.077
I think you made a really good point.

03:38.112 --> 03:40.246
Maybe he is just, like, really into me.

03:40.280 --> 03:43.516
I mean, he has, like,
stepped up his bed game a lot.

03:43.550 --> 03:45.551
It is so not about him anymore.

03:45.586 --> 03:48.020
That's disgusting. Let me know
when that treat's gonna happen.

03:48.055 --> 03:50.123
And, Cece, I'm sorry about
this, but I'm gonna stand up

03:50.157 --> 03:51.891
and you're gonna see my
penis, and when I walk out,

03:51.925 --> 03:53.726
you're gonna see my butt. Let's do this.

03:53.761 --> 03:54.761
Oh.

03:56.630 --> 04:01.100
Ah, excuse me, excuse me, excuse me.

04:01.135 --> 04:02.668
Sorry.

04:05.105 --> 04:07.073
Yeah, so that's glass.

04:07.107 --> 04:09.041
That ain't no mint.

04:09.076 --> 04:10.710
Nope.

04:10.744 --> 04:11.944
Definitely glass, and I swallowed that,

04:11.979 --> 04:14.213
so you should consider, uh, a sign.

04:14.248 --> 04:15.281
- Do you have a reservation?
- You know,

04:15.315 --> 04:16.649
it's funny that you would ask that

04:16.683 --> 04:18.117
because, you know, I tried to call, like,

04:18.152 --> 04:19.918
20 times, and I couldn't get through,

04:19.952 --> 04:21.087
but, uh, I'm looking for a reservation

04:21.120 --> 04:22.555
for tonight around 8:00 p.m.

04:22.589 --> 04:23.956
Let's say, like, five people.

04:23.991 --> 04:25.057
I have an 8:30.

04:25.092 --> 04:26.626
Ah, kind of had our heart set on 8:00.

04:26.660 --> 04:27.960
Seven weeks from now.

04:27.995 --> 04:29.962
Wait, what, what? No, n-n-n-n-no.

04:29.997 --> 04:32.632
Look, there's got to be
something that you can do.

04:32.666 --> 04:35.301
Well, you could try your
luck at the community table.

04:36.003 --> 04:37.270
Community... hell, no.

04:37.304 --> 04:38.938
Listen, um, sorry, you don't understand.

04:38.972 --> 04:41.507
This has to be an official reservation.

04:41.542 --> 04:43.176
No.

04:43.210 --> 04:46.245
I'll tell you what, maybe this will

04:46.280 --> 04:49.949
change... your mind.

04:54.888 --> 04:56.923
"I owe you a hundred dollars."

04:56.957 --> 04:58.324
Oh, hell no.

04:58.358 --> 05:01.327
No, that... that was supposed to be a ten.

05:02.396 --> 05:04.397
(sighs)

05:07.801 --> 05:10.036
Whoa, you got there faster than I thought.

05:10.070 --> 05:11.771
Hey, so this is weird
and it's only gonna take

05:11.805 --> 05:13.639
a second of your time, but, uh...

05:13.674 --> 05:14.841
and I probably already know the answer,

05:14.875 --> 05:17.109
but are you on drugs?

05:17.144 --> 05:19.278
I know the answer is no, so
I'll just see you later, man.

05:19.313 --> 05:21.047
- Get in my room.
- Don't want to be part of it!

05:23.183 --> 05:25.017
Did you crack my e-mail password?

05:25.052 --> 05:26.719
How did you guess "Smithereens"?

05:26.753 --> 05:28.788
Are you really on drugs?
Talk to me, Schmidt.

05:28.822 --> 05:31.190
I'm in way over my head, Nick,
I'm doing something terrible.

05:31.225 --> 05:32.525
Well, what is it, man?

05:32.559 --> 05:34.126
You're going to get mad at me.

05:34.161 --> 05:35.661
I'm your best friend.

05:35.696 --> 05:38.097
Okay, I was there for you
when you fell off the deck

05:38.131 --> 05:39.499
at Chester's graduation.

05:39.533 --> 05:41.167
(laughter, excited chatter)

05:42.236 --> 05:43.736
Oh, no.

05:43.770 --> 05:45.137
And I'm here for you now.

05:45.172 --> 05:48.407
There's nothing you could
say that I'd get mad at.

05:48.442 --> 05:50.877
O... okay, um, I can do this.

05:52.045 --> 05:53.980
Do you know how I broke up with Elizabeth

05:54.014 --> 05:55.915
so that I could start dating Cece again?

05:55.949 --> 05:57.416
Absolutely, and it was really hard for you.

05:57.451 --> 05:58.818
Yeah, that actually never happened.

05:58.852 --> 06:01.254
What do you mean?

06:01.288 --> 06:03.089
I'm still dating Elizabeth.

06:03.123 --> 06:04.891
What do you mean?

06:04.925 --> 06:06.726
I'm dating both of them, and
neither one of them knows it,

06:06.760 --> 06:07.727
and I feel terrible about it.

06:07.761 --> 06:08.995
But Elizabeth is gone.

06:09.029 --> 06:11.430
- What do you mean?
- She's not gone.

06:11.465 --> 06:13.399
- So you broke up with Cece...
- I didn't break up with either one of them.

06:13.433 --> 06:14.934
What do you mean?

06:14.968 --> 06:16.569
You process this however
you need to process it.

06:16.603 --> 06:17.837
If you want to keep talking it out...

06:17.871 --> 06:19.238
- Which one are you dating?
- Both.

06:19.273 --> 06:20.873
- Are you dating Cece?
- I'm dating Cece.

06:20.908 --> 06:22.241
- Are you dating Elizabeth?
- Yes.

06:22.276 --> 06:23.743
- How do you do that?
- They made me choose.

06:23.777 --> 06:24.911
You have to choose.

06:24.945 --> 06:26.178
You can't have both women.

06:26.213 --> 06:27.313
What was I supposed to do?

06:27.347 --> 06:29.282
What, you think you can
have a bunch of wives?!

06:29.316 --> 06:30.283
You got one wife!

06:30.317 --> 06:32.418
This is the way the world works!

06:32.452 --> 06:34.620
- Why?!
- I don't know.

06:34.655 --> 06:36.556
I feel terrible about this,
I don't know what to do.

06:36.590 --> 06:38.524
How could you do this
with Jess's best friend?

06:38.559 --> 06:40.092
I don't know, I feel really badly about it!

06:41.295 --> 06:43.429
In your little brain,

06:43.463 --> 06:45.464
how do you see this ending?

06:45.499 --> 06:46.766
I see it ending badly.

06:46.800 --> 06:48.768
I see it ending very, very badly.

06:48.802 --> 06:50.036
But you know what? I just...

06:50.070 --> 06:51.137
(chuckles)

06:51.171 --> 06:52.905
I want to thank you, though,

06:52.940 --> 06:54.840
just for being there for me
and for listening to me. No.

06:54.875 --> 06:56.576
I'm not listening to you
and I'm not there for you.

06:56.610 --> 06:58.277
- Because now we're in this together.
- We're not in this together

06:58.312 --> 06:59.645
and I'm not listening
and I'm not being there,

06:59.680 --> 07:01.113
so just stop telling me things!

07:01.238 --> 07:03.005
What would you like me to
do with this information?

07:03.040 --> 07:05.107
Well, it really helped me to tell you.

07:05.142 --> 07:07.543
- You should tell somebody, get it off your chest.
- I can't.

07:07.577 --> 07:08.944
- You know what I mean?
- Like... who?

07:08.979 --> 07:10.579
- Well, certainly not Jess.
- (retching)

07:10.614 --> 07:12.682
- Don't ever tell Jess.
- The one person you can't tell is Jess.

07:16.546 --> 07:17.546
Hello, Picca?

07:17.580 --> 07:19.214
Yes, I need a table for five.

07:19.249 --> 07:21.850
This is author Toni Morrison.

07:21.884 --> 07:22.884
I am?

07:22.919 --> 07:23.919
Well, oh, yeah?

07:23.953 --> 07:25.387
<i>Well, I think you're a woman!</i>

07:25.421 --> 07:26.588
Hello?

07:26.623 --> 07:27.723
Okay, here's what it is.

07:27.757 --> 07:29.758
Just lie to her, Nick.

07:29.792 --> 07:31.326
It's a relationship... men
and women lie to each other

07:31.361 --> 07:32.894
all the time; it's what
makes marriages work.

07:32.929 --> 07:34.196
Just lie...

07:34.230 --> 07:35.564
Oh, you can lie...

07:35.598 --> 07:37.899
Yes, I talked to Schmidt.

07:37.934 --> 07:40.235
Don't act like an alien;
just lie to a woman.

07:40.270 --> 07:42.170
It's... (exhales)

07:42.205 --> 07:43.372
Yeah, I talked to Schmidt.

07:43.406 --> 07:44.906
It's fine, it's not a big deal.

07:44.941 --> 07:46.241
JESS: Hey, Nick.

07:46.276 --> 07:48.744
How was your day?

07:48.778 --> 07:51.713
Nothing... (mumbling)

07:51.748 --> 07:54.016
Why are you wearing a helmet?

07:54.050 --> 07:56.652
Oh, hi.

07:58.454 --> 08:00.255
Don't tease me, Nick.

08:00.290 --> 08:01.957
Are we finally gonna do no-kiss sex?

08:03.059 --> 08:04.326
Oh, yes.

08:11.834 --> 08:14.102
Sorry about that.

08:14.137 --> 08:16.038
(sighs) Look at us.

08:16.072 --> 08:19.875
(high-pitched): Community
table, like a little community.

08:19.909 --> 08:20.909
(chuckles)

08:22.000 --> 08:28.074

08:36.993 --> 08:38.960
Call that seat.

08:38.995 --> 08:40.328
That's my seat.

08:40.363 --> 08:41.429
- Come on.
- Yeah.

08:41.464 --> 08:43.265
Oh, no, where are y'all going?

08:43.299 --> 08:44.966
Dibs on those seats, dibs on that.

08:45.001 --> 08:46.134
Put that for me right there.

08:46.169 --> 08:47.502
Hey, put that right there for me.

08:47.537 --> 08:49.805
That was amazing.

08:49.839 --> 08:52.607
<i>Jess, you know so many Spaceballs quotes.</i>

08:52.642 --> 08:55.477
(laughing): They jam the
radar with literal jam.

08:55.511 --> 08:58.680
Oh, hey, did you ever talk to Schmidt?

09:01.017 --> 09:02.617
What's going on, Nick?

09:03.953 --> 09:05.787
Schmidt! Hey!

09:06.723 --> 09:08.256
My best friend?!

09:08.291 --> 09:10.192
You Long Island street trash!

09:10.226 --> 09:11.426
Damn it, Nick, you told her?

09:11.461 --> 09:12.494
No, he didn't tell me!

09:12.528 --> 09:14.029
I... I happened upon it.

09:14.063 --> 09:15.831
Oh, you happened upon it?
Where, in the town square?

09:15.865 --> 09:17.299
Jess, I never wanted
to be involved in this.

09:17.333 --> 09:18.333
You're so pretty.

09:18.368 --> 09:19.701
Put your freakin' visor down.

09:19.736 --> 09:22.504
Now, you... you're gonna tell Cece

09:22.538 --> 09:25.640
or I will, you... you crumb bum!

09:25.675 --> 09:26.641
- Jess...
- You crumb bum.

09:26.676 --> 09:27.809
Yes, well said.

09:27.844 --> 09:29.511
- You are a lowlife.
- I... I get it.

09:29.545 --> 09:32.114
- How could you do this to her?
- Jess, I am so sorry.

09:32.148 --> 09:34.583
I made up a dance so
everyone will be happy.

09:37.854 --> 09:39.688
Cece's gonna walk through
that door any minute,

09:39.722 --> 09:41.356
and you have to tell her the truth.

09:41.391 --> 09:42.657
Jess, please, this would wreck her.

09:42.692 --> 09:44.025
I'm begging you.

09:44.060 --> 09:46.361
I... I know you don't believe
me, but I do care about her.

09:46.396 --> 09:49.197
Either you tell her or I will, Schmidt.

09:49.232 --> 09:51.366
(humming)

09:54.270 --> 09:57.038
You're right.

09:57.073 --> 09:59.074
I'll tell her.

10:00.243 --> 10:01.209
(grunts)

10:01.244 --> 10:03.912
(sputters)

10:04.914 --> 10:06.214
Yo, what it be?

10:06.249 --> 10:07.282
Double date night!

10:08.718 --> 10:10.752
What's, uh, what's going on?

10:11.754 --> 10:12.721
Tell her.

10:14.290 --> 10:15.390
Tell her.

10:15.425 --> 10:17.759
Okay, okay.

10:20.296 --> 10:22.330
We're taking two cars. It's
faster that way because of gas.

10:22.365 --> 10:23.732
- No phones.
- What?

10:23.766 --> 10:24.866
Here you go; I got the door, it's okay.

10:24.901 --> 10:26.435
Go! Go!

10:30.418 --> 10:32.419
Cigarette, phone call, bathroom. Okay.

10:38.459 --> 10:40.594
Sir, you're clearly alone.
We're gonna need this table.

10:40.628 --> 10:43.063
Okay, so what do you think...
that over the past two hours,

10:43.097 --> 10:46.433
I, as a single person, have
ordered eight separate entrees

10:46.467 --> 10:48.235
and have taken bites of different sizes

10:48.269 --> 10:51.905
of each of them to create some
sort of pointless illusion?

10:51.939 --> 10:54.441
(chuckles): Do you know
how insane you sound?

10:56.110 --> 10:58.211
God, I hate this job.

11:01.616 --> 11:03.750
- You need to slow down.
- I got it. Don't worry.

11:03.785 --> 11:04.851
What's going on, man?

11:04.886 --> 11:06.586
You guys were acting
all so weird back there,

11:06.621 --> 11:08.789
- and you're driving like a maniac.
- Oh, geez.

11:09.043 --> 11:11.745
You know, I didn't want to
have to say anything, but...

11:11.779 --> 11:13.146
What?

11:13.180 --> 11:14.514
Here we go.

11:14.548 --> 11:17.851
- Nick is cheating on Jess! Aah!
- What?!

11:17.885 --> 11:19.986
Apparently, they met at some gas station.

11:20.021 --> 11:21.922
She's much older. Much, much older.

11:21.956 --> 11:23.456
Deeply Korean.

11:23.491 --> 11:24.658
I just found out.

11:24.692 --> 11:26.593
And, I mean, Nick is
my best friend and all,

11:26.627 --> 11:28.428
but I can't even be in the same room

11:28.462 --> 11:29.829
as that scumbag right now!

11:29.864 --> 11:32.499
Oh, I'm so mad! I'm just so, so mad!

11:32.533 --> 11:34.334
I'm terribly angry about
the whole situation.

11:34.368 --> 11:35.769
I can't even drive. Take the wheel.

11:35.803 --> 11:37.504
- (tires screeching)
- Oh, why, God?!

11:37.538 --> 11:39.005
He was the best of us!

11:39.040 --> 11:41.041
- Cece, please. You're veering everywhere.
- Sorry.

11:41.075 --> 11:43.043
JESS: Oh, Nick, go, go!

11:43.077 --> 11:44.611
We're gonna lose them!

11:44.645 --> 11:46.680
You keep nerd-stopping at every sign!

11:46.714 --> 11:48.114
Look, if I get another ticket,

11:48.149 --> 11:50.016
they're gonna make me wear eyeglasses.

11:50.051 --> 11:51.718
Why didn't you get involved back there?

11:51.752 --> 11:53.453
Look, look, here's the reality.

11:53.487 --> 11:55.055
Yes, Schmidt is my best friend,

11:55.089 --> 11:56.489
and he's also really scary.

11:56.524 --> 11:58.825
You are so afraid of everything.

11:58.859 --> 12:00.694
Oh, really? Would a
man afraid of everything

12:00.728 --> 12:02.829
- put his finger in a cigarette lighter?
- I don't know...

12:02.863 --> 12:04.030
Don't do that. That's just stupid!

12:04.065 --> 12:05.865
- I'm not gonna do that.
- You wimp.

12:05.900 --> 12:07.534
(screams)

12:07.568 --> 12:08.969
Oh, my gosh! Oh, my God!

12:09.003 --> 12:10.370
- Jess, are you okay?
- It really hurts.

12:10.404 --> 12:11.738
- Oh, my Lord, are...
- It's so hot!

12:11.772 --> 12:13.206
- Come here. Are you okay?
- Yeah.

12:13.240 --> 12:14.641
Are you okay? Look, I'm gonna do it.

12:14.675 --> 12:16.176
Ow! Oh.

12:16.210 --> 12:17.043
Why did you do that?

12:17.078 --> 12:18.244
So that we were both

12:18.279 --> 12:19.412
in the same amount of pain!

12:19.447 --> 12:20.814
I'm gonna junk-punch him.

12:20.848 --> 12:22.215
Turn the car around. We're
going to the restaurant.

12:22.249 --> 12:23.583
Why would you... ? That seems rash.

12:23.617 --> 12:24.851
Maybe... I don't know.

12:24.885 --> 12:26.386
Maybe staying away for a while,

12:26.420 --> 12:27.854
or at least... I don't
know... talking about it,

12:27.888 --> 12:29.489
hearing his side. I don't...

12:29.523 --> 12:31.091
Cheating is selfish, and it is cowardly,

12:31.125 --> 12:32.726
and there is no excuse for it.

12:32.760 --> 12:35.261
The only thing that you can do

12:35.296 --> 12:36.663
is punch it in the junk.

12:36.697 --> 12:37.897
Or you could really understand it

12:37.932 --> 12:39.566
emotionally from their point of view.

12:39.600 --> 12:41.434
You don't know. Maybe
they had a tough childhood.

12:41.469 --> 12:43.503
- Turn the car around, Schmidt.
- Maybe their mom's a lesbian.

12:43.537 --> 12:45.772
- I don't know.
- Turn the car around!

12:45.806 --> 12:47.540
Yeah, let's do it. Let's
turn the car around.

12:47.575 --> 12:49.009
Let's go to Picca.

12:49.043 --> 12:50.910
I'm gonna turn the car around
as soon as I turn this...

12:50.945 --> 12:52.612
Turn the car around Schmidt!

12:52.646 --> 12:55.115
- As soon as I turn the car around.
- Now!

12:55.149 --> 12:56.683
As soon as I turn this car around...

12:56.717 --> 12:58.551
Turn the car around, Schmidt! Let's go!

12:58.586 --> 13:00.120
And I'm turning the
car around. Let's do it.

13:00.154 --> 13:01.888
- (horn honking)
- (chuckles) Here we come.

13:01.922 --> 13:04.224
- What is he doing?
- I don't know.

13:04.258 --> 13:06.126
Looks like he lost a wing.

13:08.596 --> 13:11.598
(speaking gibberish, clicking tongue)

13:13.834 --> 13:15.835
(speaking gibberish)

13:17.772 --> 13:19.139
Hey, Jess.

13:19.173 --> 13:20.607
Yeah, fourth message.

13:20.641 --> 13:22.809
Just a friendly time update.

13:22.843 --> 13:26.212
8:13. Hope to God you
guys aren't bailing on me,

13:26.247 --> 13:28.615
or maybe you just lost
track of time being couples!

13:28.649 --> 13:30.050
(forced laugh)

13:30.084 --> 13:32.485
Hit me back. Winnie the Bish.

13:44.520 --> 13:45.566
SCHMIDT: We're never
gonna find this restaurant;

13:45.567 --> 13:46.499
maybe we should just go home.

13:46.534 --> 13:47.634
- There it is!
- Here it is.

13:47.668 --> 13:49.636
(tires screech)

13:54.475 --> 13:56.342
MAN: Welcome!

13:56.377 --> 13:58.711
- Can I have your car, sir?
- Oh.

14:00.214 --> 14:01.981
Sir?

14:02.016 --> 14:03.650
Sir?

14:06.687 --> 14:09.189
Sir?

14:09.223 --> 14:11.491
I'm on the phone.

14:11.525 --> 14:13.827
All right, time's up. You
got to get out of here.

14:13.861 --> 14:15.528
Uh, th... that's my friend.

14:15.563 --> 14:17.831
That's my friend. See? See? I told you all.

14:17.865 --> 14:19.032
Huh? I got friends.

14:19.066 --> 14:20.266
- Everybody? Hmm?
- (applause)

14:20.301 --> 14:21.668
- (clears throat)
- That's my friend right there.

14:21.702 --> 14:23.036
Where the hell is Nick?!

14:23.070 --> 14:24.804
How did I even beat him here?!

14:24.839 --> 14:27.607
- That was the slowest ride of my entire life!
- Oh, Jess...

14:27.641 --> 14:30.677
Literally, my grandmother
drives faster than that.

14:30.711 --> 14:33.279
- Look, she's my best friend.
- Yeah.

14:33.314 --> 14:35.515
And Schmidt is mine. That's why
I didn't want to get involved.

14:35.549 --> 14:39.352
Well, when someone I love
gets hurt, I get involved.

14:41.856 --> 14:44.157
(car door closes)

14:46.427 --> 14:48.528
Sir?

14:48.562 --> 14:50.430
(knocking on car door)

14:50.464 --> 14:52.232
(knocking continues)

14:52.266 --> 14:53.833
What's up, big cat?

14:53.868 --> 14:55.335
MAN: Sir? Sir?

14:55.369 --> 14:58.171
Well, you got to go in there,
and you got to face her.

14:58.205 --> 15:00.974
Look, it's not about Cece.
This is about the $12 valet.

15:01.008 --> 15:03.143
It's $12 to... ?

15:03.177 --> 15:05.478
One sec. Hey, it's self-park!

15:05.513 --> 15:07.881
The maroon car is self-park!

15:10.417 --> 15:12.752
It's an excessive amount of money.

15:12.786 --> 15:15.588
I didn't mean for any of this to happen.

15:15.623 --> 15:18.057
Look, I know you didn't, okay?

15:18.092 --> 15:20.760
But now it's time you do
the right thing, Schmidt.

15:22.763 --> 15:24.430
I can't go in there.

15:24.465 --> 15:26.866
Well, I can't let Jess tell her.

15:29.303 --> 15:31.070
MAN: Hello? (knocking)

15:31.105 --> 15:32.705
Open the door.

15:32.740 --> 15:35.742
- Wait, Cece!
- Oh, Jess, I have something to tell you.

15:35.776 --> 15:37.443
I have something to tell you! What?

15:37.478 --> 15:39.112
No, I have something I need to tell you.

15:39.146 --> 15:40.246
(groaning)

15:40.281 --> 15:41.915
Oh, my God, what are you doing, Cece?!

15:41.949 --> 15:44.884
Why did you do that?! (sighs)

15:44.919 --> 15:46.286
- (high-pitched screaming)
- Cece.

15:46.320 --> 15:48.021
You nipped the corner!

15:48.055 --> 15:50.623
Wait, Cece. Uh... okay. I...

15:50.658 --> 15:52.492
Cece, he's not...

15:54.562 --> 15:56.930
I lied to you. I...

15:59.166 --> 16:01.901
I've been cheating on...
on you with Elizabeth.

16:08.342 --> 16:09.809
(sighs)

16:14.148 --> 16:16.049
Uh, I hate to do this right now,

16:16.083 --> 16:19.018
but if we don't sit,
we will lose this table.

16:24.340 --> 16:26.607
SCHMIDT: Cece, I'm sor... I'm sorry.

16:26.642 --> 16:28.776
I don't... I just...

16:28.811 --> 16:31.112
(chuckles)

16:31.146 --> 16:34.382
Is there someplace maybe
we could, uh, go talk?

16:34.416 --> 16:37.352
Everybody knows anyway, Schmidt.
Might as well just say it.

16:37.386 --> 16:39.153
Oh, let's talk. Let's... we...

16:39.188 --> 16:40.521
this should be fine.

16:40.556 --> 16:41.889
(Schmidt sighs)

16:41.924 --> 16:43.891
I didn't want to hurt you.

16:43.926 --> 16:45.827
You have to know that

16:45.861 --> 16:47.395
I did not want to hurt you.

16:47.429 --> 16:48.663
Please, I... I'm begging you.

16:48.697 --> 16:50.098
If you take anything away from this,

16:50.132 --> 16:51.966
know that I did not want to hurt you.

16:52.000 --> 16:53.201
I didn't want to hurt anyone.

16:53.235 --> 16:55.370
Especially you.

16:55.404 --> 16:57.205
You have no idea

16:57.239 --> 16:59.207
what you mean to me.

16:59.241 --> 17:02.543
And I got caught up in this thing, and...

17:02.578 --> 17:06.580
I used to be so fat.

17:06.615 --> 17:10.251
I mean, like... truly gigantic.

17:12.253 --> 17:15.223
I mean, as big as... as
big... as big as it gets.

17:15.257 --> 17:19.894
And now... and now I'm not, and
girls like me, and I don't...

17:19.928 --> 17:22.262
I don't know how to do this.

17:22.297 --> 17:24.531
I got lost.

17:25.867 --> 17:28.236
And I'm sorry.

17:28.270 --> 17:30.405
You're sorry?

17:30.439 --> 17:32.306
You didn't want to hurt anybody?

17:32.341 --> 17:34.342
That's the best you can do, Schmidt?

17:34.376 --> 17:37.011
Really?

17:37.045 --> 17:39.647
I don't know.

17:39.681 --> 17:41.716
I don't know you.

17:43.152 --> 17:44.952
(sniffles)

17:44.987 --> 17:47.455
Good-bye, Schmidt.

17:47.489 --> 17:48.990
(sighs)

18:02.214 --> 18:05.116
I'm just realizing that I
don't have any cash on me.

18:06.885 --> 18:09.921
If anyone would be willing
to loan me $12 for the valet,

18:09.955 --> 18:12.957
that would be... greatly appreciated.

18:15.941 --> 18:17.175
Cece still hasn't called me.

18:17.209 --> 18:19.110
Do you think you could test my phone again?

18:19.145 --> 18:21.779
I can't. I don't have any more minutes.

18:21.814 --> 18:23.414
Minutes, Nick?!

18:23.449 --> 18:25.450
Who still has minutes on their phone?!

18:25.484 --> 18:27.952
I bought 10,000 minutes in
1999, and I'm still using them.

18:27.987 --> 18:29.287
I'm sorry. I just...

18:29.321 --> 18:31.489
I... I really want to be there for her.

18:31.524 --> 18:32.991
You are, okay?

18:33.025 --> 18:35.527
And she'll call, 'cause she needs you.

18:35.561 --> 18:37.829
(sighs): Hell.

18:37.863 --> 18:40.198
This is a real butt munch
of a situation we're in.

18:40.232 --> 18:42.033
Yeah.

18:42.207 --> 18:44.542
Look...

18:44.576 --> 18:46.177
I'm here for you.

18:46.211 --> 18:48.913
There is nothing I know more than the fact

18:48.947 --> 18:52.283
that I want to be with you, Jess, okay?

18:59.024 --> 19:01.359
Unless we're driving.

19:01.393 --> 19:03.461
You admitted to driving
while legally blind!

19:03.495 --> 19:05.263
No, because you're honestly
the worst backseat...

19:05.297 --> 19:07.699
You're honestly telling me
what to do the entire time!

19:07.733 --> 19:10.335
- Legally blind.
- Whoever has the wheel controls the car!

19:10.369 --> 19:11.803
ELIZABETH: You liar!

19:11.837 --> 19:14.405
Here's your pie!

19:21.914 --> 19:24.315
You broke my heart.

19:24.350 --> 19:26.150
Mail me my mouth guard.

19:27.820 --> 19:29.887
(door slams)

19:29.922 --> 19:32.123
In case you were wondering

19:32.157 --> 19:34.959
if Cece had Elizabeth's
number, sh... she does.

19:34.993 --> 19:38.496
So, tough time in
Schmidtsburg, wouldn't you say?

19:38.530 --> 19:40.531
Just a quick heads-up, Nick,

19:40.566 --> 19:42.033
Jess.

19:42.067 --> 19:43.534
I blame you for this whole thing.

19:43.569 --> 19:46.537
- You can't seriously...
- I was going to fix it.

19:48.107 --> 19:49.874
I wasn't going to hurt anyone.

19:49.908 --> 19:52.543
But, since you took it upon
yourself to hurt both of them,

19:52.578 --> 19:54.545
should it take me the rest of my life,

19:54.580 --> 19:56.547
I'm going to break the two of you up.

19:56.582 --> 19:59.217
- Bring it, Schmidt.
- It's impossible. We're really strong.

19:59.251 --> 20:00.752
It will be when you least expect it,

20:00.786 --> 20:02.720
which might be when you most expect it.

20:02.755 --> 20:05.056
Could actually be when you're
watching the movie version

20:05.090 --> 20:06.924
<i>of What to Expect When You're Expecting.</i>

20:06.959 --> 20:08.326
Regardless...

20:08.360 --> 20:12.063
I... am coming...

20:12.097 --> 20:13.798
for you.

20:17.603 --> 20:19.470
Oh, my God, Schmidt is
so scary. You were right.

20:19.505 --> 20:21.506
We have to talk about the things

20:21.540 --> 20:23.040
- that he could use to pull us apart, okay?
- Okay.

20:23.075 --> 20:24.542
Okay. Okay, politics.

20:24.576 --> 20:25.943
You're a Democrat, I've never voted.

20:25.978 --> 20:28.079
- I'm in the Green Party.
- Oh, that is so annoying.

20:28.113 --> 20:31.582
Okay, I have been banned for
my lifetime from Lake Ontario.

20:31.617 --> 20:33.117
- Don't ask.
- Okay.

20:33.152 --> 20:34.786
- What else do you have?
- My fear of pears.

20:34.820 --> 20:36.921
Okay, you're afraid of pears?

20:36.955 --> 20:38.089
And pear-shaped people.

20:38.123 --> 20:39.857
Um, that's interesting.

20:39.892 --> 20:41.392
I'm not convinced I know how to read.

20:41.397 --> 20:42.663
I've just memorized a lot of words.

20:42.668 --> 20:44.702
The doctors say I might
grow another 18 inches.

20:44.727 --> 20:46.027
That's a different image of you,

20:46.061 --> 20:47.729
but I'm gonna get past
that, and I'm past it.

20:47.763 --> 20:49.664
- Okay, the moon landing...
- Mm-hmm.

20:49.698 --> 20:51.733
- Uh, which is obviously fake.
- No, it's not obviously fake.

20:51.767 --> 20:53.234
- No, that's actually not what...
- Are you crazy?

20:53.268 --> 20:54.502
The moon landing is
definitely fake, by the way.

20:54.536 --> 20:55.570
- The moon landing's not...
- What?!

20:55.604 --> 20:56.704
The shadows are off.

20:56.739 --> 20:57.748
- No, they're not.
- Yes, they are.

20:57.750 --> 20:59.258
I've looked at photos on the
Internet, and it proves it.

20:59.542 --> 21:01.209
- Nick, that's...
- The shadows are off, the shadows are off... !

21:01.244 --> 21:03.825
Shadows are not... those
photos are Photoshopped.

21:03.886 --> 21:05.687
- That's not true.
- People do that as a joke

21:05.721 --> 21:07.155
- to trick stupid people.
- Oh, yeah, you can just Photoshop...

21:07.189 --> 21:08.856
- No, that's...
- Wait a minute.

21:08.891 --> 21:11.826
He's doing it already.
He's getting in our heads.

21:11.860 --> 21:14.262
- Unbelievable. Good call.
- Okay, this is good. Let's keep going.

21:14.296 --> 21:15.414
- I totally agree. Okay.
- Let's keep going. Okay.

21:15.920 --> 21:18.250
I... kind of want to get a gun.

21:18.251 --> 21:19.251
I'm definitely sexually
attracted to Lady Bucks.

21:21.184 --> 21:21.878
Ok.

21:24.379 --> 21:26.333
I prefer the ***.

21:26.334 --> 21:27.661
I think it's the best one.

21:27.662 --> 21:29.345
- I know that you're very into it...
- It's not.

21:29.346 --> 21:31.126
Yes, it is. He's very charming.

21:31.127 --> 21:33.327
I'm weirdly good at volleyball.

21:33.328 --> 21:35.344
I believe horses are from outer space.

21:35.345 --> 21:36.981
- I believe that too!
- Ok. Good.
