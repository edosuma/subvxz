WEBVTT

00:16.418 --> 00:18.268
Yeah! Finally done!

00:18.268 --> 00:20.148
Dude. Celebration hug?

00:20.148 --> 00:21.218
Yeah, man!

00:22.718 --> 00:24.158
AWW! SICK!

00:25.508 --> 00:27.308
Dude, you almost hugged me!

00:27.308 --> 00:29.368
No way! You almost hugged me!

00:29.368 --> 00:31.548
We mowed that lawn in its face!

00:31.548 --> 00:33.298
Yeah, dude. Let's go on break.

00:33.298 --> 00:34.648
Now you're talking.

00:35.368 --> 00:36.428
Hold it!

00:39.128 --> 00:40.748
Nope. It's no good.

00:40.748 --> 00:42.328
AWW, WHAT?!

00:42.328 --> 00:44.108
It's an inch too tall.

00:44.128 --> 00:46.568
Do it again! DO IT ALL AGAIN!

00:47.678 --> 00:49.508
It's just one inch!

00:49.508 --> 00:51.678
Would you want to play Ultimate Frisbee in this?

00:51.678 --> 00:54.908
A guy could trip, skid, get severe turf rash, and BAM!

00:54.908 --> 00:57.108
Lawsuit. Now get to work.

00:57.108 --> 00:58.418
- But... but... but... - Oh wait.

00:58.768 --> 01:01.898
Is that the sound of somebody who wants to be fired?

01:02.508 --> 01:03.918
That's what I thought.

01:06.008 --> 01:08.778
I can't re-mow the lawn! I'm a busy guy!

01:08.778 --> 01:10.698
- No, you're not. - Yeah-huh!

01:10.698 --> 01:12.508
I got a meatball sub I gotta eat!

01:12.508 --> 01:13.808
My life sucks.

01:13.808 --> 01:17.588
Whatever. It's not like you can hire someone to do your work while you slack off.

01:17.808 --> 01:19.188
"Hire someone?"

01:20.248 --> 01:22.468
- Duuude! - Hey!

01:26.328 --> 01:28.468
Hey, dude. Thanks for bailing on me.

01:28.648 --> 01:31.118
- What is this? - I'm gonna hire a temp.

01:31.118 --> 01:32.788
This sounds like a scam.

01:32.788 --> 01:34.858
Hey, if hiring a dude to do all my work

01:34.858 --> 01:36.418
and paying them a small part of my paycheck

01:36.418 --> 01:38.558
while I go get a meatball sub is a scam,

01:38.558 --> 01:41.538
then THIS IS A HUUUUUGE SCAM!

01:44.718 --> 01:47.018
Let me know when you want to stop wasting time.

01:47.748 --> 01:49.478
So, tell me a little bit about yourself.

01:50.298 --> 01:51.738
Uh, I like pyrotechnics.

01:55.338 --> 01:57.058
So, what are you good at?

01:57.708 --> 01:59.158
Pyrotechnics!

02:05.168 --> 02:07.438
Let me guess, you like pyrotechnics.

02:07.438 --> 02:10.058
No, but I do like this.

02:14.318 --> 02:16.098
Alright, alright, that's enough!

02:19.048 --> 02:22.848
Man! I can't find one normal person in this town who wants a job!

02:22.848 --> 02:23.948
I give up!

02:29.578 --> 02:31.738
Well, time to find me a job!

02:34.308 --> 02:35.958
Hey! Hey you! Come here!

02:35.978 --> 02:36.748
What's your name?

02:36.748 --> 02:38.998
Name's Doug, sir. I'm looking for a job.

02:39.068 --> 02:41.078
You've come to the right place, Doug!

02:41.218 --> 02:43.148
But first, tell me about yourself.

02:43.148 --> 02:45.988
Well, all my life I've wanted to be somebody.

02:45.988 --> 02:47.558
I'm willing to do whatever it takes!

02:48.458 --> 02:50.408
How are you with mowing lawns?

02:50.498 --> 02:52.798
Well, I don't mean to be negative,

02:52.928 --> 02:55.138
but it looks to me like that grass is an inch too tall.

02:55.288 --> 02:57.328
Oh, you're good.

02:57.388 --> 03:00.368
Alright, let's get you fitted to your new job!

03:02.928 --> 03:05.698
Thank you so much for this job, Mr. Rigby!

03:07.448 --> 03:10.188
Hey dude, Benson wanted me to give you your weeks pay.

03:10.778 --> 03:12.098
Who's that?

03:12.098 --> 03:14.008
Oh, that's Doug. He's my new temp.

03:14.008 --> 03:15.968
What? Are you serious?!

03:16.148 --> 03:17.148
Hey, Dougie!

03:18.088 --> 03:18.968
Payday!

03:20.308 --> 03:22.288
First, I gotta cover the finder's fee!

03:22.648 --> 03:23.688
Here you go.

03:24.628 --> 03:26.808
Wow, this is the most I've ever been paid!

03:26.808 --> 03:29.518
Thanks Mr. Rigby! You're the best boss ever!

03:30.558 --> 03:32.048
You make me sick.

03:35.708 --> 03:38.418
Wow, this place is huge!

03:38.418 --> 03:40.328
Yeah, it's pretty cool. This way.

03:40.818 --> 03:42.018
So you'll crash here.

03:43.388 --> 03:44.278
On this?

03:44.278 --> 03:46.398
No, no, you don't just start with the trampoline.

03:46.398 --> 03:47.678
You gotta pay your dues.

03:47.728 --> 03:49.308
This is where you'll be sleeping.

03:50.558 --> 03:52.608
There's some socks in case you get cold.

03:52.638 --> 03:54.088
My own bed!

03:54.248 --> 03:56.568
Rigby...wow, Rigby.

03:56.568 --> 04:00.008
If you don't mind me saying, you're the best boss I've ever had!

04:00.008 --> 04:00.918
You know what, Doug?

04:00.978 --> 04:04.068
I think this is gonna work out just fine!

04:08.598 --> 04:10.888
I'm tired, I'm taking a break!

04:10.888 --> 04:12.718
Keep it shakin' with the rakin' there, guys!

04:13.698 --> 04:16.098
"Keep it shakin' with the rakin' there, guys!"

04:16.827 --> 04:18.488
Nice impression there, Mordecai!

04:18.498 --> 04:19.438
Listen to this one!

04:19.598 --> 04:21.327
Keep it shakin' with the rakin' there, guys!

04:22.888 --> 04:24.658
Dude, that sounds just like him!

04:26.088 --> 04:26.908
What's so funny?

04:26.908 --> 04:30.088
Dude, Doug is hilarious! Check out his impression of you!

04:30.308 --> 04:34.088
Hi, I'm Rigby, and I got me a meatball sub!

04:36.168 --> 04:38.058
I...I don't sound like that!

04:38.058 --> 04:39.478
Dude, it's like, dead-on!

04:39.478 --> 04:41.368
Hello, I'm, Rigby, nice to meet you!

04:44.648 --> 04:45.958
Dude, that wasn't cool!

04:46.278 --> 04:48.028
You should've seen your face!

04:48.028 --> 04:50.188
Dude, impressions are the lowest form of comedy.

04:50.188 --> 04:52.968
"Hey, I'm Doug! I'm easily impressed because I have a small brain!"

04:53.018 --> 04:55.058
See? It's easy to copy somebody else.

04:55.828 --> 04:57.788
- Yo, Doug-ay! - Hey, fellas!

04:59.688 --> 05:02.388
- Ready for some hoops? - Oh, you know it!

05:03.328 --> 05:04.668
Uh, wait!

05:04.908 --> 05:06.048
Can I come along, too?

05:06.078 --> 05:09.258
Oh...well, it's kind of a two-on-two rematch.

05:09.258 --> 05:10.318
Sorry, dude.

05:13.528 --> 05:15.878
- Cover him! - I got this fool!

05:15.878 --> 05:17.718
Over here, over here!

05:17.718 --> 05:19.498
From downtown!

05:20.038 --> 05:21.638
Boom-shaka-laka!

05:23.448 --> 05:24.748
I could've done that.

05:27.348 --> 05:29.218
Hey, that's my haircut!

05:30.578 --> 05:32.048
Two hot dogs, please.

05:32.048 --> 05:34.708
Yo Doug, I need some dawgs over here!

05:34.708 --> 05:36.558
Dogs from a dawg!

05:37.428 --> 05:38.588
I got 'em, I got 'em!

05:41.358 --> 05:43.798
- Way to throw 'em! - Way to catch 'em!

05:45.168 --> 05:48.048
Alright, who else wants some dawgs?

05:48.258 --> 05:50.098
That's probably not as fun as it looks.

05:52.958 --> 05:55.668
He's holding up his tail just like me!

05:56.988 --> 05:59.098
Dude, I love working with you, man!

05:59.098 --> 06:00.388
We make a great team.

06:00.388 --> 06:01.938
Yeah, man. That's just me.

06:01.938 --> 06:04.018
I love working hard, know what I'm saying?

06:04.348 --> 06:05.818
I guess Rigby's just kinda...

06:05.978 --> 06:08.298
- What? - Uh, I shouldn't say anything.

06:08.298 --> 06:09.558
Go ahead, You can say it!

06:09.558 --> 06:11.158
Rigby's kinda lazy.

06:11.158 --> 06:13.018
Yeeaah, he is!

06:16.468 --> 06:18.828
Hey guys, I wanted to come by and thank you!

06:18.828 --> 06:21.418
Ultimate Frisbee was a great success!

06:21.418 --> 06:22.638
Everybody loved it!

06:22.928 --> 06:25.628
Kudos Mordecai! You too, Rigby. See ya!

06:25.628 --> 06:26.228
Later!

06:26.278 --> 06:27.538
Yeah, see ya...

06:28.368 --> 06:29.298
Benson!

06:30.578 --> 06:31.298
No!

06:33.448 --> 06:35.058
Dude, Doug is creeping me out!

06:35.058 --> 06:36.328
I think I gotta fire him.

06:36.328 --> 06:38.288
What? Doug's actually pretty cool.

06:38.288 --> 06:39.918
He's totally copying me!

06:39.918 --> 06:41.948
Dude, you're being paranoid.

06:41.948 --> 06:42.918
Are you kidding me?

06:42.918 --> 06:44.628
The dark circles around his eyes,

06:44.668 --> 06:48.118
the lovable scoundrel shtick? CLASSIC RIGBY!

06:48.118 --> 06:51.348
He probably has his rings around his eyes because he's working all the time!

06:51.448 --> 06:55.088
Whatever man, just give me my paycheck so I can pay him to get out of here!

06:55.088 --> 06:56.828
Pfft, nice try.

06:56.828 --> 06:57.708
What are you talking about?

06:57.708 --> 06:59.528
I gave it to you two hours ago.

06:59.628 --> 07:02.658
- What?! Where's Doug?! - Upstairs.

07:02.708 --> 07:04.698
That's it! He's finished!

07:04.958 --> 07:06.908
DOOUG! DOUG DOUG DOUG!

07:08.968 --> 07:10.348
Oh hey, Rigby.

07:10.398 --> 07:12.118
Doug, give me my paycheck!

07:12.268 --> 07:14.298
Paycheck? Oh, you mean this one?

07:14.408 --> 07:15.758
Sure, take it!

07:17.318 --> 07:20.108
Gotta cover the finder's fee! Remember?

07:20.958 --> 07:22.838
Doug, this has gone too far!

07:22.898 --> 07:24.228
You're FIRED!

07:24.228 --> 07:26.158
Fired? You can't fire me!

07:26.158 --> 07:27.998
This is the best job I've ever had!

07:27.998 --> 07:30.948
I'm finally becoming somebody! Besides...

07:30.998 --> 07:33.578
I'm more Rigby than you ever were...

07:33.678 --> 07:36.148
or will be!

07:49.998 --> 07:51.638
I'm...Rigby!

07:51.638 --> 07:53.288
NO! I'm Rigby!

07:53.478 --> 07:54.318
Rigby!

07:54.318 --> 07:55.348
WHAT?!

07:57.418 --> 07:58.358
I'm Rigby!

07:58.358 --> 07:59.468
No, I'm Rigby!

08:09.218 --> 08:10.948
Yeah, I can't tell who's who.

08:10.948 --> 08:12.628
There's only one way to solve this.

08:12.628 --> 08:14.708
Alright, I'm gonna have you do a couple of things

08:14.708 --> 08:15.978
and ask some questions.

08:15.978 --> 08:17.978
Whoever gets them right is the real Rigby,

08:17.978 --> 08:20.808
and whoever doesn't - I'm calling the cops!

08:25.378 --> 08:27.458
They both can't punch very hard.

08:29.268 --> 08:31.088
They both can't take a punch.

08:33.278 --> 08:34.658
Ultimate fail!

08:34.658 --> 08:36.707
They're both horrible at video games.

08:39.568 --> 08:41.597
They're both equally lazy.

08:43.048 --> 08:45.848
Okay, how does Rigby like his BLTs?

08:45.848 --> 08:48.158
No lettuce, no tomatoes, hold the bread and double the bacon!

08:48.598 --> 08:49.498
Correct.

08:49.498 --> 08:51.808
What did Rigby get for Pops' birthday?

08:51.808 --> 08:52.938
Easy, nothing!

08:52.938 --> 08:54.598
Oh, it's true!

08:54.598 --> 08:57.648
Twas the best nothing I ever received!

08:58.708 --> 09:01.108
- Rigby's high score in Strong John? - Three!

09:01.108 --> 09:03.468
- Favorite cereal? - Sugar-frosted marshmallow clusters!

09:03.468 --> 09:05.468
Rigby's greatest fear?

09:08.928 --> 09:09.628
Well?

09:11.338 --> 09:13.328
Amusement park mascots!

09:13.378 --> 09:14.918
Yep, you're Rigby!

09:15.998 --> 09:18.298
Hey, dude! Celebratory hug?

09:18.298 --> 09:19.448
Yeah, man!

09:20.378 --> 09:21.558
Fine, fine!

09:21.548 --> 09:23.058
You guys wanna hang out with him?

09:23.058 --> 09:25.168
Go ahead! See if I care!

09:25.238 --> 09:27.388
I just hope you think next time about

09:27.388 --> 09:30.988
choosing a total imposter over your best friend, Mordecai!

09:31.118 --> 09:31.718
Wait!

09:32.308 --> 09:33.998
That's Rigby!

09:33.998 --> 09:35.028
Huh? But-

09:35.028 --> 09:36.348
I knew it was you, dude.

09:36.348 --> 09:38.258
What?! But why didn't you say anything?!

09:38.258 --> 09:40.288
Heh, I just wanted to mess with you.

09:40.328 --> 09:42.628
Only the real Rigby whines that much.

09:42.628 --> 09:45.108
In your FACE, Doug!

09:45.108 --> 09:47.978
Plus, the real Rigby would never hug me.

10:01.748 --> 10:05.938
Yeah, the perps full name is Doug "The Doppleganger" Shablowski.

10:05.938 --> 10:08.408
He's been pulling this scam all over the country!

10:08.408 --> 10:11.628
But thanks to you, he can be brought to justice!

10:11.628 --> 10:12.698
Here he comes!

10:13.738 --> 10:16.238
Hey, hold on a sec, I got something to say.

10:16.318 --> 10:19.048
Rigby, I want you to know...a guy like me?

10:19.048 --> 10:20.838
Ain't got a lot to be thankful for.

10:21.018 --> 10:21.918
But you?

10:22.048 --> 10:25.668
You got friends, a job, a nice warm bed...

10:25.668 --> 10:27.368
you got a good thing going here.

10:27.478 --> 10:28.588
Never forget that.

10:28.678 --> 10:30.208
Okay! Move it along!

10:32.998 --> 10:34.468
Wow, what a windbag!

10:34.468 --> 10:35.878
I thought he'd never shut up.

10:35.928 --> 10:37.948
I can't believe you guys thought Doug was me!

10:38.068 --> 10:40.058
You must feel like idiots! Am I right?

10:41.828 --> 10:44.728
I'm the only one around here who hires and fires,

10:44.728 --> 10:47.448
so if you really don't wanna do your own job,

10:47.448 --> 10:49.548
I'd be glad to accommodate you!

10:49.638 --> 10:54.208
Otherwise, you're on toilet duty for the next THREE MONTHS!

10:54.318 --> 10:55.598
Unbelievable!

10:56.948 --> 10:59.008
Hey Mordecai, wanna make an easy ten bucks?
