00:01.183 --> 00:02.745
Previously on "Mistresses"...

00:03.068 --> 00:05.358
- I thought you were done with Sam.
- I am. It's a schoolboy crush

00:05.358 --> 00:06.426
he's taking a step too far.

00:06.426 --> 00:08.358
Maybe you seduced her.

00:08.358 --> 00:09.926
Sally, Alex and I are just friends.

00:09.926 --> 00:12.795
If you believe that, then
you are dumber than you look.

00:12.795 --> 00:15.098
Congratulations. Savi told me... the baby.

00:16.432 --> 00:18.935
For the first time since
you told me, I feel better.

00:18.935 --> 00:22.338
I saw Paul. I just saw my dead husband.

00:22.338 --> 00:24.841
No, you didn't. Sweetie,
you've gotta let go.

00:28.945 --> 00:30.947
Hi, April.

00:35.885 --> 00:38.221
Hi.

00:38.221 --> 00:40.456
Wh... I don't know who you
are, but this isn't funny.

00:40.456 --> 00:42.458
April, it's me.

00:42.458 --> 00:43.960
It's Paul.

00:43.960 --> 00:45.027
No, you're not Paul.

00:45.027 --> 00:47.330
You can't be Paul. Paul is dead.

00:47.330 --> 00:49.165
- Just take a breath.
- You've been dead for three years.

00:49.165 --> 00:50.933
You... you died. You drowned.

00:50.933 --> 00:52.101
I didn't.

00:52.101 --> 00:53.202
I didn't die.

00:56.005 --> 00:58.074
I faked my death.

01:02.548 --> 01:04.784
Hello? What? Right now?

01:04.784 --> 01:06.318
Oh, my God.

01:06.318 --> 01:09.655
No, of course. Yes. Of course. Okay.

01:09.655 --> 01:13.192
Shh... um, Lucy just
threw up in her carpool.

01:13.192 --> 01:14.260
She's on her way back home right now.

01:14.260 --> 01:15.494
You have to go. You have to get...

01:15.494 --> 01:16.495
I have to talk to you.

01:16.495 --> 01:18.264
You have to get out of here!

01:18.264 --> 01:19.632
Okay. I'm gonna text you my number.

01:19.632 --> 01:22.168
Get in touch with me when you can.

01:29.999 --> 01:31.300
Hi.

01:31.300 --> 01:32.368
Hey.

01:34.703 --> 01:36.672
You look nice.

01:36.672 --> 01:38.474
- I do?
- Yeah.

01:38.474 --> 01:40.542
Thank you.

01:40.542 --> 01:43.479
It's almost noon. Shouldn't you be at work?

01:43.479 --> 01:46.515
Oh, I'm going in late today.

01:46.515 --> 01:48.584
I have a doctor's appointment.

01:48.584 --> 01:50.419
My 6-week checkup.

01:50.419 --> 01:53.455
I wasn't sure if I should tell you.

01:53.455 --> 01:56.358
Uh, but now that you know,

01:56.358 --> 01:59.461
if you'd like to come with me, you can.

01:59.461 --> 02:02.398
Obviously, you don't have to.

02:02.398 --> 02:03.999
No. No. Um,

02:03.999 --> 02:05.401
it's just...

02:05.401 --> 02:07.436
it is a bit late for me
to reschedule my day...

02:07.436 --> 02:08.937
- Yeah.
- But I'll... I'll go to the next one. Okay?

02:08.937 --> 02:11.473
- Okay.
- Okay.

02:13.000 --> 02:19.074

02:21.283 --> 02:23.319
All right, I thought we
were gonna buy a pillow.

02:23.319 --> 02:25.020
One pillow.

02:25.020 --> 02:26.588
How do I put this delicately?

02:26.588 --> 02:28.590
Your apartment makes
me want to kill myself.

02:28.590 --> 02:29.992
So if I'm gonna be crashing
there for a little bit,

02:29.992 --> 02:32.594
let's at least make it livable, okay?

02:32.594 --> 02:34.296
I'm going for minimalist.

02:34.296 --> 02:35.998
No, you're going for cheap.

02:35.998 --> 02:38.434
I know. 'Cause I'm broke.

02:38.434 --> 02:40.402
Well, that's why God invented credit cards.

02:40.402 --> 02:42.071
Don't worry. I'm gonna make it pretty.

02:42.071 --> 02:43.706
So what's the plan for tonight, mi amigo?

02:43.706 --> 02:45.607
I was thinking Mexican takeout...

02:45.607 --> 02:46.742
Okay.

02:46.742 --> 02:49.311
And... a "Golden Girls" marathon?

02:49.311 --> 02:50.946
Please.

02:50.946 --> 02:52.715
Okay. Okay. Well, then
I'm thinking mojitos,

02:52.715 --> 02:54.483
which means we need to get mint.

02:54.483 --> 02:57.486
And a rug. Definitely another rug.

03:00.889 --> 03:03.459
- Oh, my God.
- What?

03:03.459 --> 03:05.027
Oh, crap.

03:05.027 --> 03:06.795
Is this the first time you guys
have seen each other since...

03:06.795 --> 03:07.863
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.
- You look amazing.

03:07.863 --> 03:09.298
- Yeah?
- Amazing.

03:09.298 --> 03:10.399
- Okay.
- Mm-hmm.

03:10.399 --> 03:12.668
- Hi.
- Hey.
- Hey.

03:12.668 --> 03:13.736
Hey.

03:16.405 --> 03:19.375
Um, this is my friend Story.

03:19.375 --> 03:21.043
Like a bedtime story.

03:21.043 --> 03:22.778
It's nice to meet you.

03:24.413 --> 03:26.882
You know what? We should go. We have, um...

03:26.882 --> 03:30.486
Yeah. We should... we should go, too. Um...

03:30.486 --> 03:32.021
It's nice to see you, Alex.

03:32.021 --> 03:34.523
It's nice to see you, too.

03:36.325 --> 03:38.560
Okay, that wasn't so bad.

03:38.560 --> 03:40.462
Are you okay? 'Cause I feel really weird.

03:40.462 --> 03:42.031
- I'm fine.
- Yeah?

03:42.031 --> 03:45.434
Yeah. Uh, yep. Uh, yeah.

03:45.434 --> 03:47.069
I broke up with her, remember?

03:47.069 --> 03:48.070
Yeah, you're right.

03:48.070 --> 03:49.158
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

03:49.168 --> 03:52.441
All right. Let's go get that
mint. Let's go get some mint.

04:10.025 --> 04:12.061
Hi.

04:12.061 --> 04:14.063
This is crazy.

04:14.063 --> 04:16.298
I know. Please come in.

04:25.741 --> 04:27.576
130 over 80.

04:27.576 --> 04:29.411
Much better than last time.

04:29.411 --> 04:31.713
I think Harry's been
cooking with less sodium.

04:31.713 --> 04:33.582
Well, tell him to keep it up

04:33.582 --> 04:35.884
and that he's welcome to
attend these appointments.

04:35.884 --> 04:38.353
Yeah. He wanted to come. He was just busy.

04:38.353 --> 04:39.721
He'll be at the next one, though.

04:39.721 --> 04:42.291
Oh. Then would you like to wait?

04:42.291 --> 04:44.560
- Wait for what?
- To hear the heartbeat.

04:44.560 --> 04:46.295
You can hear the heartbeat already?

04:46.295 --> 04:48.363
It's a little early. The fetal doppler

04:48.363 --> 04:50.732
needs to hit the baby
in exactly the right way.

04:50.732 --> 04:53.502
Doesn't always happen,
but would you like to try?

04:55.337 --> 04:57.005
We... we should probably wait.

04:57.005 --> 05:00.509
Of course. It's a big moment for dads, too.

05:00.509 --> 05:03.011
Hmm.

05:05.280 --> 05:07.783
Starting to feel pretty real, isn't it?

05:11.753 --> 05:14.389
Would you like to sit?

05:17.626 --> 05:19.294
How's Lucy feeling?

05:19.294 --> 05:21.730
You don't get to ask me that.

05:21.730 --> 05:24.766
You missed three years of stomachaches.

05:24.766 --> 05:26.301
Where the hell have you been?

05:26.301 --> 05:28.637
I don't know where to start.

05:28.637 --> 05:30.439
You faked your own death. Start there.

05:34.076 --> 05:37.646
Do you remember our
last Christmas together?

05:37.646 --> 05:39.281
Your surprised us by coming home early

05:39.281 --> 05:40.616
from one of your business trips.

05:40.616 --> 05:42.518
You brought Lucy princess Jasmine pajamas.

05:42.518 --> 05:45.787
- What does that have to do with you...
- I lost my job that week.

05:45.787 --> 05:48.323
You lost your job so you
decided to fake your death?

05:48.323 --> 05:49.992
No. That's not what I mean.

05:49.992 --> 05:52.628
If you can't tell me the truth
right now, then I can't do this.

05:52.628 --> 05:54.062
I didn't want to have to tell you.

05:54.062 --> 05:56.331
I thought I could find
a new job, no problem.

05:56.331 --> 05:57.699
Then three months went by,

05:57.699 --> 05:58.901
and we were running through our savings,

05:58.901 --> 06:00.802
and you had no idea.

06:00.802 --> 06:03.005
I had no idea about a lot of things.

06:04.706 --> 06:06.041
Go on.

06:06.041 --> 06:07.442
Don't be shy. Let's hear it.

06:07.442 --> 06:09.077
Let's hear about Miranda.

06:09.077 --> 06:11.680
She already showed up
at my door with your son.

06:11.680 --> 06:13.949
I'm so sorry, April.

06:13.949 --> 06:15.717
It was a stupid fling.

06:15.717 --> 06:17.753
After I lost my job, I
tried to break it off,

06:17.753 --> 06:20.022
- but she was...
- But why did you start it in the first place?

06:20.022 --> 06:22.991
How was I not enough for you?

06:22.991 --> 06:24.493
You were.

06:24.493 --> 06:27.429
You were my everything.

06:27.519 --> 06:31.056
I married the damn prom
queen, and every day, I just...

06:31.056 --> 06:33.058
I kept waiting for the other shoe to drop.

06:33.058 --> 06:34.726
Every day, I couldn't understand

06:34.726 --> 06:36.094
what you were still doing with me.

06:36.094 --> 06:37.529
We'd made so many plans in high school,

06:37.529 --> 06:40.599
and I hadn't delivered on any of them.

06:40.599 --> 06:42.701
I felt like I failed you.

06:42.701 --> 06:44.069
I know that sounds pathetic.

06:44.069 --> 06:46.038
It sure does.

06:46.038 --> 06:48.040
It was a mistake.

06:48.040 --> 06:49.908
But by the time I was
trying to break it off,

06:49.908 --> 06:53.512
she was pregnant and threatening
to tell you everything.

06:53.512 --> 06:54.913
I freaked out.

06:54.913 --> 06:56.415
I couldn't figure out how to get out

06:56.415 --> 06:58.050
of the mess I'd made of my life.

06:58.050 --> 07:02.087
And I knew you'd never
forgive me. I just wanted...

07:02.087 --> 07:04.423
I wanted to leave you something.

07:06.858 --> 07:10.862
So you faked your own death

07:10.862 --> 07:13.131
and left two women to mourn you

07:13.131 --> 07:14.966
and raise your children?

07:14.966 --> 07:17.469
No.

07:17.469 --> 07:19.137
Just one.

07:19.137 --> 07:21.773
What are you talking about?

07:21.773 --> 07:24.976
I've been living with Miranda
and Scottie this whole time.

07:53.085 --> 07:56.589
Oh, hey, uh, I'm late
for a conference call.

07:56.589 --> 07:59.692
Can you deliver this to
Dom immediately, please?

08:01.460 --> 08:04.063
Is there a problem?

08:04.063 --> 08:05.431
No problem at all.

08:05.431 --> 08:06.799
Great.

08:11.537 --> 08:13.706
You're lying. I don't believe you.

08:13.706 --> 08:16.642
I don't believe you! No,
Miranda thinks you're dead!

08:16.642 --> 08:17.676
She doesn't.

08:17.676 --> 08:19.045
We've been together ever since.

08:19.045 --> 08:20.546
Ever since you died?

08:22.214 --> 08:24.183
What if I called her right now?

08:24.183 --> 08:26.285
I wouldn't do that. She
doesn't know I'm here,

08:26.285 --> 08:27.753
- and I'd prefer to handle that...
- Oh, you'd prefer?

08:32.058 --> 08:34.284
This is Miranda.

08:34.284 --> 08:35.653
Leave a message, and I'll call you back.

08:35.653 --> 08:40.957
- Ugh! I gotta get out of here.
- Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Wait. Wait.

08:40.888 --> 08:43.691
A month ago, Miranda told
me she was taking Scottie

08:43.691 --> 08:45.859
to visit her mother in Minnesota.

08:45.859 --> 08:47.294
Two days ago, I couldn't
reach her on her cell,

08:47.294 --> 08:48.796
so I called her mom.

08:48.796 --> 08:51.298
That's when I found out
she never went to Minnesota.

08:51.298 --> 08:53.667
So I realized she must've come here.

08:53.667 --> 08:54.935
Wh...

08:54.935 --> 08:57.171
How did you know she came here?

08:57.171 --> 09:00.641
Money's been tight.
Miranda's been frustrated.

09:00.641 --> 09:03.577
She's been talking a lot
about your settlement money.

09:03.577 --> 09:05.646
And I know that she was
tracking the bank account,

09:05.646 --> 09:07.615
waiting for the deposit.

09:07.615 --> 09:10.317
She has my bank account?

09:10.317 --> 09:13.754
You never changed the password.

09:13.754 --> 09:16.991
So this has been a scam.

09:16.991 --> 09:19.560
The two of you have been scamming me.

09:19.560 --> 09:21.061
No, not me.

09:21.061 --> 09:23.664
I had nothing to do with
it. This was all her.

09:23.664 --> 09:24.732
How am I supposed to believe

09:24.732 --> 09:27.067
a word that comes out of your mouth?!

09:27.067 --> 09:29.136
April.

09:29.136 --> 09:30.638
Don't give her any money.

09:34.174 --> 09:35.542
You wanted to see me?

09:35.542 --> 09:37.978
Yes, come here. Allez. Allez.

09:39.279 --> 09:41.115
Come.

09:43.083 --> 09:44.318
What do you see?

09:46.086 --> 09:47.321
Is this a trick question?

09:47.231 --> 09:48.866
As part of our diversification,

09:48.866 --> 09:51.802
we are developing a hotel on Strand Beach.

09:51.802 --> 09:53.470
And I'm meeting with
the architect tomorrow,

09:53.470 --> 09:55.205
and I would like you to come with me,

09:55.205 --> 09:57.708
to represent the target clientele.

09:57.708 --> 09:59.209
How am I the target clientele?

09:59.209 --> 10:01.912
We are going chic, young, style-conscious,

10:01.912 --> 10:04.248
a club scene, for lack of a better term,

10:04.248 --> 10:07.952
and out of everyone here,
you understand the aesthetic.

10:07.952 --> 10:10.454
Well, that's not saying much.

10:10.454 --> 10:11.755
You're wearing your friend's bracelet.

10:11.755 --> 10:14.224
How do you know it's not mine?

10:14.224 --> 10:16.827
How is she doing?

10:16.827 --> 10:18.095
Alex, was it?

10:18.095 --> 10:19.229
Mm-hmm.

10:19.229 --> 10:20.698
Why? Do you want her number?

10:20.698 --> 10:23.233
Because I hate to break it to you,

10:23.233 --> 10:24.702
you're not Alex's type.

10:24.702 --> 10:27.104
And what exactly is her type?

10:27.104 --> 10:28.839
The type with boobs.

10:28.839 --> 10:30.207
She's a lesbian.

10:30.207 --> 10:33.544
Now if you'll excuse me, I
have an open house to get to,

10:33.544 --> 10:37.047
but, uh, text me about tomorrow. Okay?

10:53.197 --> 10:55.199
Harry?

10:56.967 --> 10:58.235
Hey.

10:58.235 --> 11:00.137
What... what are you doing down here?

11:00.137 --> 11:03.207
My office is right down the street.

11:03.207 --> 11:05.476
Right. Yeah.

11:06.510 --> 11:08.112
I forgot.

11:08.112 --> 11:09.113
How are you doing?

11:09.113 --> 11:11.482
Good.

11:11.482 --> 11:14.084
You know, if you ever want to talk...

11:14.084 --> 11:16.220
Thanks, Karen. I... I appreciate that,

11:16.220 --> 11:18.455
but, um...

11:18.455 --> 11:19.690
I wouldn't want to put
you in that position.

11:19.690 --> 11:21.025
You're Savi's best friend.

11:21.025 --> 11:23.160
We've known each other for 15 years.

11:23.160 --> 11:26.230
You're my friend, too.

11:26.230 --> 11:29.166
Has it been that long?

11:29.166 --> 11:31.635
Yeah. Wow.

11:31.635 --> 11:35.472
You know, when I met Savi...

11:35.472 --> 11:37.074
And you, for that matter...

11:37.074 --> 11:38.876
you were both out there on the water,

11:38.876 --> 11:41.178
surfing your hearts out.

11:43.047 --> 11:45.082
Thought I was dealing
with two little hippies,

11:45.082 --> 11:46.817
a couple of cute stoner types.

11:46.817 --> 11:49.620
It's funny how you expect
someone to be a certain way

11:49.620 --> 11:52.690
and then when you get to know them,

11:52.690 --> 11:55.159
they are nothing like that at all.

11:58.796 --> 12:00.064
What's going on?

12:04.702 --> 12:06.603
I kind of lied to Savi.

12:08.072 --> 12:12.072
We went to this work party
at her office, and I, uh...

12:13.477 --> 12:15.012
And you punched the other guy in the face.

12:15.012 --> 12:17.214
Wow.

12:17.214 --> 12:20.451
You girls like to talk
about everything, don't you?

12:20.451 --> 12:23.987
Yeah. So I punched him in the face.

12:23.987 --> 12:26.924
And then I told Savi that
it made me feel better.

12:26.924 --> 12:28.559
And it didn't?

12:28.559 --> 12:30.227
Well, no, it did,

12:30.227 --> 12:32.496
but it didn't exactly solve everything.

12:33.630 --> 12:36.100
Now she thinks we're on the mend,

12:36.100 --> 12:38.068
mainly because I've been
trying to act like we are,

12:38.068 --> 12:40.070
but...

12:40.070 --> 12:42.206
but we're not.

12:45.008 --> 12:49.008
This morning she invited
me to her 6-week checkup,

12:49.847 --> 12:51.482
and I thought...

12:54.651 --> 12:57.921
if the kid isn't mine,
why should I be in there?

12:57.921 --> 13:00.190
This is all about the baby then?

13:00.190 --> 13:02.126
Look, don't get me wrong, I'm not thrilled

13:02.126 --> 13:04.828
that she slept with another man, but...

13:04.828 --> 13:06.163
but I reckon I could get past it.

13:06.163 --> 13:08.599
You know, I mean, I... I... I
think that I could get past it

13:08.599 --> 13:11.068
because...

13:11.068 --> 13:13.070
because I want to be a father.

13:14.471 --> 13:15.672
But?

13:15.672 --> 13:17.241
If it's not my kid,

13:17.241 --> 13:19.843
am I really gonna be able to do that?

13:19.843 --> 13:23.843
You're trying to figure
everything out and you can't.

13:24.782 --> 13:27.551
Give yourself time with this one.

13:27.551 --> 13:29.219
Take it day by day.

13:29.219 --> 13:32.656
You just may be surprised
at what you're capable of.

13:49.173 --> 13:51.575
I just saw your neighbor making
spaghetti completely naked,

13:51.575 --> 13:53.043
and let me tell you,

13:53.043 --> 13:55.913
his meatballs did not look appetizing.

14:01.018 --> 14:02.719
What's going on?

14:04.087 --> 14:06.890
Sally has completely erased
every single photo of us,

14:06.890 --> 14:09.126
like our relationship never existed.

14:09.126 --> 14:11.662
Look at that.

14:11.662 --> 14:14.198
Well, what happened to
"I broke up with her"?

14:14.198 --> 14:17.701
That's not the point. I mean, look.

14:17.701 --> 14:19.870
She's dating that Story girl.

14:20.871 --> 14:22.506
They're in a relationship,

14:22.506 --> 14:23.941
which I don't even know
how that's possible.

14:23.941 --> 14:27.477
Okay. Okay. We are unfriending Sally.

14:27.477 --> 14:29.847
- Hold on. One second.
- No. No. No. No. No. Sweetie.

14:29.847 --> 14:31.548
You need closure.

14:31.548 --> 14:32.950
Sally never deserved you,

14:32.950 --> 14:36.950
and she's clearly traded down
by dating some bedtime Story.

14:37.621 --> 14:39.089
You don't think she's pretty?

14:39.089 --> 14:40.891
Are you kidding me? She was gross.

14:40.891 --> 14:42.226
She is not gross.

14:42.226 --> 14:45.062
Did you see her? Someone
needs to give her a sandwich.

14:47.097 --> 14:48.999
There.

14:48.999 --> 14:50.767
That's better.

14:50.767 --> 14:53.937
God, you're so beautiful.

15:01.879 --> 15:02.880
Wait.

15:02.880 --> 15:04.648
What?

15:04.648 --> 15:06.950
Nothing.

15:16.860 --> 15:19.496
I rescheduled Josh Haber
for tomorrow afternoon,

15:19.496 --> 15:21.565
and April Malloy called
while you were in session.

15:21.565 --> 15:23.066
I'll call her back from the car.

15:23.066 --> 15:25.068
Thanks for filling in today.

15:25.068 --> 15:27.504
Hey. I didn't know you were still here.

15:27.504 --> 15:28.939
Finished for the night?

15:28.939 --> 15:30.774
Just one more patient.

15:30.774 --> 15:33.510
Well, have a nice evening.

15:33.510 --> 15:34.645
Karen, wait.

15:34.645 --> 15:36.780
It feels like we're in a fight.

15:36.780 --> 15:37.848
I don't want that.

15:37.848 --> 15:40.050
You have every right to be mad at me.

15:40.050 --> 15:43.020
Which accomplishes nothing.

15:43.020 --> 15:46.857
Honestly, I was just worried
about you, but if you're okay...

15:46.857 --> 15:48.158
I'm okay.

15:48.158 --> 15:49.893
Good.

15:51.194 --> 15:52.896
Dr. Pollock. Sorry I'm late.

15:52.896 --> 15:54.898
Not a problem. Come in.

16:11.236 --> 16:13.272
This is Sam. Leave a message.

16:13.272 --> 16:15.174
Sam, it's Karen.

16:15.174 --> 16:17.142
I was surprised to see you today.

16:17.142 --> 16:21.113
Please call me at your
earliest convenience.

16:24.683 --> 16:26.952
April, hi.

16:26.952 --> 16:29.188
What?

16:29.188 --> 16:30.989
I'm on my way.

16:33.158 --> 16:35.094
What the hell is wrong with you?

16:35.094 --> 16:37.029
Please keep your voice down.

16:37.029 --> 16:38.764
I'm in the middle of
trial prep when I get this

16:38.764 --> 16:39.765
from your assistant.

16:39.765 --> 16:41.266
Okay. You know what?

16:41.266 --> 16:44.036
We really don't need any more
attention drawn to us right now.

16:44.036 --> 16:46.238
You are asking me to relinquish
all legal rights to the baby.

16:46.238 --> 16:48.273
Have you lost your damn mind?

16:48.273 --> 16:49.308
I'm sorry. Okay?

16:49.308 --> 16:52.811
I am out of my depth here.

16:52.811 --> 16:54.313
I... I didn't know what to do.

16:54.313 --> 16:56.915
I wanted to talk to you
about it. Is it mine?

16:56.915 --> 16:58.784
I don't know.

16:58.784 --> 17:01.086
So you just drew up the
contracts just in case?

17:01.086 --> 17:04.923
Okay. You know what?
What... what if it is yours?

17:04.923 --> 17:07.126
What would you want?

17:07.126 --> 17:10.095
Partial custody, I mean, visitation rights?

17:10.095 --> 17:13.165
Is that what you signed up
for when we slept together?

17:13.165 --> 17:14.199
Of course not. But it happened.

17:14.199 --> 17:17.970
Do you even want a kid right now?

17:17.970 --> 17:19.238
Because Harry and I do.

17:21.205 --> 17:23.142
Look...

17:23.142 --> 17:27.179
Harry and I are together.
Okay? That's not gonna change.

17:27.179 --> 17:30.282
And I'm just desperately
trying to figure out

17:30.282 --> 17:33.585
what is best for everyone here,

17:33.585 --> 17:36.655
okay? In... including this baby.

17:36.655 --> 17:39.158
No.

17:39.158 --> 17:41.093
No. You... you're doing
what's best for you.

17:41.093 --> 17:42.861
- No.
- You keep controlling things

17:42.861 --> 17:44.663
and deciding which way things are gonna go,

17:44.663 --> 17:47.799
and you know what?
I'm... I'm done with that.

17:47.799 --> 17:49.935
I'm not signing anything.

17:51.136 --> 17:54.239
Let me know when you get
those paternity results.

18:05.117 --> 18:08.120
Uh, hey, April, I... I
can't really talk right now.

18:08.120 --> 18:11.623
Can I call you back in a...

18:11.623 --> 18:12.858
What?!

18:12.858 --> 18:14.593
What do you think...

18:14.593 --> 18:15.961
Chinese or deli?

18:15.961 --> 18:18.363
Whatever you want. Chinese.

18:20.732 --> 18:22.634
Do you want me to get that?

18:22.634 --> 18:24.136
Who is it?

18:27.706 --> 18:28.840
It's your sister.

18:29.975 --> 18:31.643
Fascinating.

18:33.345 --> 18:36.148
Just let her sweat a little bit.

18:38.750 --> 18:40.586
Hey. I, uh, can't talk right now. I'm busy.

18:44.156 --> 18:46.024
Are you kidding me?

18:46.024 --> 18:48.927
Of course. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'll be there.

18:48.927 --> 18:50.095
Okay. Bye.

18:50.095 --> 18:51.129
That didn't sound good.

18:51.129 --> 18:53.198
Uh, yeah. Wow. I'm so sorry.

18:53.198 --> 18:56.134
I gotta go. My friend April's
having some kind of emergency.

18:56.134 --> 18:58.136
- What happened?
- I don't think that I understand yet,

18:58.136 --> 19:01.006
but I... I really gotta go.
I'll... you gonna be okay?

19:01.006 --> 19:02.841
- Yeah.
- Okay. Bye.

19:02.841 --> 19:05.210
Okay. Bye. Yeah. I'll
be back as soon as I can.

19:05.210 --> 19:07.012
Okay.

19:10.171 --> 19:12.006
Well, he might as well have been dead,

19:12.006 --> 19:14.676
- because I am going to kill him!
- Shh. Lucy's sleeping.

19:14.676 --> 19:17.779
Sorry. I'm gonna kill him, April.

19:17.779 --> 19:20.882
I... I still can't picture any of this.

19:20.882 --> 19:22.083
Does he look the same?

19:23.785 --> 19:26.154
Sweetie, I'm so sorry.

19:26.154 --> 19:28.289
I can't even imagine.

19:28.289 --> 19:30.158
How are you even processing this?

19:30.158 --> 19:32.927
Oh, God. It just hits
me in waves sometimes.

19:32.927 --> 19:34.962
Mostly I just feel sick.

19:34.962 --> 19:36.931
When you saw him, did you cry?

19:36.931 --> 19:38.399
I didn't have time to cry.

19:38.399 --> 19:40.101
I was too busy listening to all of his crap

19:40.101 --> 19:43.705
about why he did it and how
I'm being scammed by Miranda.

19:43.705 --> 19:45.740
I knew it was a scam. I
didn't know Paul was alive,

19:45.740 --> 19:47.642
but I knew that lady was up to no good.

19:47.642 --> 19:50.411
Yes, but was it all her
or was it him and her?

19:50.411 --> 19:52.280
Well, that doesn't make any
sense. If it was him and her,

19:52.280 --> 19:54.916
why would he be here telling
you not to give her any money?

19:54.916 --> 19:56.351
Ugh. I have no idea.

19:56.351 --> 19:59.387
Considering Paul has told the bigger lie,

19:59.387 --> 20:02.824
it's possible Miranda's telling the truth.

20:02.824 --> 20:04.325
Maybe she doesn't know Paul's alive.

20:04.325 --> 20:06.394
Exactly. And if that's the
case, I can't be the one

20:06.394 --> 20:08.663
to tell her, right? Or... or do I have to?

20:08.663 --> 20:10.365
Wait. Hold on, Mother Teresa.

20:10.365 --> 20:14.135
What if Paul and Miranda have
been in cahoots from the start

20:14.135 --> 20:16.304
and now Paul's turned on Miranda,

20:16.304 --> 20:17.772
and he plans to kill her

20:17.772 --> 20:19.240
and steal all the money for himself?

20:21.042 --> 20:22.176
Cahoots happens.

20:22.176 --> 20:24.112
Or Miranda has been scamming you

20:24.112 --> 20:25.713
and Paul's telling the truth.

20:25.713 --> 20:27.982
But she hired that lawyer.
If she knew Paul was alive,

20:27.982 --> 20:29.984
- then why would she...
- That's true. I forgot about that.

20:29.984 --> 20:31.719
Yeah, but the lawyer
could've just been a bluff

20:31.719 --> 20:34.288
to get you to cave on the money.

20:34.288 --> 20:35.957
If that's the case,

20:35.957 --> 20:37.825
you have two professional
liars on your hands.

20:38.893 --> 20:41.996
Mm, you're gonna get through this.

20:41.996 --> 20:43.898
We're here for you, April.

20:43.898 --> 20:45.762
Whatever you need.

20:47.301 --> 20:49.036
Okay.

20:49.036 --> 20:50.705
First thing, I guess,

20:50.705 --> 20:54.041
is I have to find out the truth.

21:06.281 --> 21:07.782
Hey, Karen.

21:07.782 --> 21:09.984
You look really not good.

21:09.984 --> 21:12.187
Thank you. That's exactly how I feel.

21:12.187 --> 21:13.455
Why? What's wrong?

21:13.455 --> 21:16.691
My friend is going
through something terrible.

21:16.691 --> 21:19.894
In this case, it actually is a friend.

21:19.894 --> 21:21.329
Well, I'm sorry to hear that.

21:21.329 --> 21:23.298
Let me know if I can help.

21:23.298 --> 21:26.434
Jacob, I meant to ask you,

21:26.434 --> 21:28.803
are you seeing Sam Grey as a patient?

21:28.803 --> 21:31.206
Well, last night was his first session.

21:31.206 --> 21:34.042
You know he's the son of Thomas Grey?

21:34.042 --> 21:35.710
I gathered as much.

21:35.710 --> 21:38.146
And you don't think there's
a conflict of interest?

21:38.146 --> 21:39.280
I don't see why there would be.

21:40.982 --> 21:42.917
He could've gone to any practice,

21:42.917 --> 21:44.686
but he chose the one his father went to?

21:44.686 --> 21:46.321
It feels a little close.

21:46.321 --> 21:47.956
Am I missing something here?

21:47.956 --> 21:50.058
Wait. Have you treated Sam?

21:50.058 --> 21:52.193
Me? No.

21:52.193 --> 21:53.728
Oh. Then I don't foresee an issue,

21:53.728 --> 21:56.030
unless there's something else I don't know.

21:56.030 --> 21:58.433
No. Nothing else.

21:58.433 --> 22:00.268
Then you have nothing to worry about.

22:09.844 --> 22:13.414
I knew you went hiking.
Why didn't you wake me up?

22:13.414 --> 22:15.250
Mm, well, you got in so late last night,

22:15.250 --> 22:16.951
I just didn't want to wake you.

22:18.786 --> 22:21.389
Alex, if this is about
last night, I'm so sorry.

22:21.389 --> 22:23.224
I really hate that I
had to leave like that.

22:23.224 --> 22:24.392
Oh, no, no. It's okay.

22:26.661 --> 22:28.396
It really was an emergency.

22:28.396 --> 22:30.231
I know what happens between us

22:30.231 --> 22:32.400
is important and we need to talk and...

22:32.400 --> 22:35.403
Listen, you do not owe me anything.

22:35.403 --> 22:38.239
This is... you're not the problem.

22:38.239 --> 22:39.340
But there's a problem?

22:39.340 --> 22:41.309
Yeah.

22:43.177 --> 22:44.379
I like you.

22:44.379 --> 22:46.447
I like you, too.

22:46.447 --> 22:48.449
No, it's not the same.

22:48.449 --> 22:52.449
It's... I actually... I
actually have feelings for you.

22:52.921 --> 22:56.190
It's been happening for
a while now, I think.

22:56.190 --> 22:58.159
Okay.

22:58.159 --> 22:59.994
M... m... it's...

22:59.994 --> 23:02.330
My...

23:02.330 --> 23:05.066
You know, I should've... I knew...

23:05.066 --> 23:09.066
I knew that it was...
and I didn't and I'm st...

23:10.271 --> 23:11.973
just so frustrated because it's...

23:11.973 --> 23:15.810
Alex. You're really all over the place here

23:15.810 --> 23:17.745
and you're kind of
freaking me out, so just...

23:17.745 --> 23:19.847
I can't be friends with you anymore.

23:21.349 --> 23:22.917
Wait. Hold on.

23:22.917 --> 23:24.452
- No. No. No.
- Please. Don't...

23:24.452 --> 23:26.721
Seriously, this is crazy, Alex. No.

23:26.721 --> 23:28.423
You just think that you want more from me

23:28.423 --> 23:30.191
because you're all messed
up and sad right now.

23:30.191 --> 23:32.193
It's not crazy. It makes complete sense.

23:32.193 --> 23:34.963
You are totally my type. You are. You are.

23:34.963 --> 23:37.098
You are smart,

23:37.098 --> 23:38.266
you're bossy,

23:38.266 --> 23:39.968
you are aggressive,

23:39.968 --> 23:43.137
you are funny, you are...

23:44.305 --> 23:47.875
you know, you're a... a
lot like Sally, actually.

23:47.875 --> 23:49.110
Control freak Sally?

23:49.110 --> 23:52.246
No, not in that way, just
in... in the way that I,

23:52.246 --> 23:55.350
uh, that I feel when I'm with you.

23:55.350 --> 23:57.251
You make me feel safe.

23:57.251 --> 24:00.888
Come on.

24:00.888 --> 24:04.225
You have no idea how
incredible you are, do you?

24:32.253 --> 24:34.789
This is Miranda.

24:34.789 --> 24:36.758
Leave a message, and I'll call you back.

24:36.758 --> 24:38.192
Hi, Miranda. It's April.

24:38.192 --> 24:41.896
I just wanted to let you
know that the check is ready.

24:41.896 --> 24:43.965
Why don't you come by
the shop tomorrow morning,

24:43.965 --> 24:45.433
say around 9:00?

24:45.433 --> 24:47.268
I can give it to you there.

24:47.268 --> 24:49.203
Okay. See you then.

24:58.112 --> 25:00.314
Hi, Paul.

25:00.314 --> 25:02.850
Hi. I need to see you.

25:08.022 --> 25:09.157
Oh. There you are.

25:10.224 --> 25:12.226
What are you doing here?

25:12.226 --> 25:14.195
Do you have a minute?

25:14.195 --> 25:16.431
Yeah. Is it about April?

25:16.431 --> 25:19.000
I called her today, but she
hasn't called me back yet.

25:19.000 --> 25:20.935
Yeah, I called her this morning, too.

25:20.935 --> 25:22.136
Nothing.

25:22.136 --> 25:24.405
But no, actually, that's not why I'm here.

25:24.405 --> 25:26.274
Could I ask you a question?

25:26.274 --> 25:30.078
It's... kind of personal and pretty big.

25:30.078 --> 25:31.946
Yeah, of course. What's wrong?

25:31.946 --> 25:33.181
It's about my friend Alex.

25:33.181 --> 25:35.216
Oh, no.

25:35.216 --> 25:36.117
Oh, is she sick?

25:36.117 --> 25:38.753
Oh, my God. No.

25:38.753 --> 25:41.055
That would be horrible. Man, you are dark.

25:41.055 --> 25:43.257
Well, you said it was big.

25:43.257 --> 25:44.926
It is big.

25:44.926 --> 25:46.794
She doesn't want to be my friend anymore.

25:46.794 --> 25:48.796
This is your big crisis?

25:48.796 --> 25:51.332
Okay, let's talk about
it in my office, please.

25:51.332 --> 25:55.103
So we had sex again yesterday,
and it messed everything up.

25:55.103 --> 25:59.173
Well, here's an idea. Maybe you
should stop having sex with her.

26:01.676 --> 26:03.111
I can't do this right now.

26:03.111 --> 26:05.146
Right. Never mind.

26:05.146 --> 26:07.081
I... I'm sorry. It's
just... my boss is mad at me.

26:07.081 --> 26:08.683
You know what? It's
fine. I'll... it's fine.

26:08.683 --> 26:10.384
Forget it. I'll figure it out myself.

26:35.009 --> 26:38.813
You said you wanted to talk.

26:38.813 --> 26:41.382
Yes, but for you to call me.

26:41.382 --> 26:43.117
I'm sorry. I just...

26:43.117 --> 26:45.086
I wanted to do this in person.

26:46.754 --> 26:48.923
Are you scared of me?

26:48.923 --> 26:51.058
That's the last thing I wanted

26:51.058 --> 26:54.128
and exactly why I need to apologize.

26:54.128 --> 26:56.197
You broke into my office.

26:56.197 --> 26:58.099
Was I not supposed to be afraid?

26:58.099 --> 26:59.801
I didn't mean to...

26:59.801 --> 27:01.335
I wasn't expecting the alarm to go off.

27:01.335 --> 27:03.738
It was stupid.

27:03.738 --> 27:05.273
I just... I wanted to
leave you that picture.

27:05.273 --> 27:06.808
To provoke me.

27:06.808 --> 27:08.176
I guess, yeah.

27:08.176 --> 27:11.979
Yeah, I wanted to get some
kind of reaction from you.

27:11.979 --> 27:15.082
I've been calling you but I...
I keep getting the machine.

27:15.082 --> 27:18.219
Is that why you made an
appointment with Jacob?

27:18.219 --> 27:19.320
To see me?

27:19.320 --> 27:20.822
At first, yeah.

27:20.822 --> 27:21.989
Then...

27:21.989 --> 27:23.691
I don't know, after talking with him...

27:23.691 --> 27:25.159
You spoke to him about me?

27:25.159 --> 27:26.961
No. God, no.

27:26.961 --> 27:29.030
It was all hypothetical and...

27:30.431 --> 27:33.267
I've handled everything so badly.

27:34.969 --> 27:36.170
Please don't hate me.

27:36.170 --> 27:39.307
I'm so sorry for everything.

27:39.307 --> 27:40.675
Sam...

27:40.675 --> 27:42.043
I think I'm in love with you.

28:27.088 --> 28:28.422
Hi.

28:28.422 --> 28:29.824
Hey.

28:31.826 --> 28:33.928
This is a nice surprise.

28:33.928 --> 28:36.230
I thought you'd be at
the restaurant by now.

28:37.932 --> 28:40.101
Yeah. I need to talk to you.

28:40.101 --> 28:42.737
Uh-oh.

28:42.737 --> 28:44.071
That sounds serious.

28:44.071 --> 28:47.041
Yeah. Yeah, it is.

28:50.878 --> 28:52.013
I love you, Savi.

28:52.013 --> 28:55.049
No. No. No. No.

28:55.049 --> 28:56.717
- No. No. No. No.
- No. Wait. Wait. Wait.

28:56.717 --> 28:58.386
Wait. Wait. Listen. Listen.

28:58.386 --> 29:00.721
- I love you...
- Please.

29:00.721 --> 29:03.457
And I want to be with you

29:03.457 --> 29:05.927
and I've searched my soul,

29:05.927 --> 29:08.996
and I can picture us
raising a child together...

29:10.264 --> 29:12.266
moving past everything
that's happened and...

29:12.266 --> 29:14.001
Becoming a family?

29:14.001 --> 29:15.036
Yeah.

29:16.871 --> 29:18.906
Yeah.

29:18.906 --> 29:20.308
But the picture...

29:20.308 --> 29:23.210
it just doesn't work

29:23.210 --> 29:25.813
if the baby isn't mine,

29:25.813 --> 29:27.815
you know,

29:27.815 --> 29:29.750
and let's face it... chances are it isn't.

29:29.750 --> 29:31.018
No, don't say that.

29:31.018 --> 29:32.920
Come on. We've been trying for years, Sav.

29:32.920 --> 29:35.460
The odds aren't exactly
in our favor, are they?

29:35.460 --> 29:38.296
I don't care about the odds.

29:40.365 --> 29:42.200
Well, I do.

29:42.200 --> 29:44.236
What are you saying?

29:44.236 --> 29:47.672
I can't see another way around it.

29:47.672 --> 29:49.875
I mean, obviously, we'll wait
for the paternity results,

29:49.875 --> 29:53.945
but when they come, if the baby isn't mine,

29:53.945 --> 29:55.881
then you have a choice to make.

29:55.881 --> 29:58.550
What kind of choice?

29:58.550 --> 30:01.386
Me...

30:01.386 --> 30:02.888
or the baby.

30:13.999 --> 30:15.301
You want some more coffee?

30:15.301 --> 30:16.302
Oh, I better not. I gotta pick up Scottie,

30:16.302 --> 30:17.970
and we're heading down to Florida.

30:17.970 --> 30:19.638
He must be, uh,

30:19.638 --> 30:21.340
excited to go back home.

30:21.340 --> 30:23.309
He's obsessed with pink's hot dogs,

30:23.309 --> 30:25.144
so he says he never wants to leave.

30:25.144 --> 30:27.279
We're grabbing a couple for the road.

30:27.279 --> 30:30.382
Speaking of which, I
really... I should get going.

30:32.151 --> 30:35.054
Um, so...

30:35.054 --> 30:36.322
the check?

30:36.322 --> 30:38.457
Of course.

30:42.127 --> 30:43.295
The check.

30:46.198 --> 30:48.267
I can't thank you enough, April.

30:48.267 --> 30:50.436
This...

30:50.436 --> 30:53.138
this means so much to Scottie and me.

30:53.138 --> 30:55.341
I'm just happy to be
putting this all in the past,

30:55.341 --> 30:57.243
for both of us.

31:00.079 --> 31:01.280
What are you doing here?

31:01.280 --> 31:02.448
Yeah, see,

31:02.448 --> 31:04.984
I was way more shocked than that.

31:14.546 --> 31:16.882
This is why I prefer doing
business with the Germans.

31:16.882 --> 31:18.083
They are never late.

31:18.083 --> 31:19.150
Hmm.

31:21.920 --> 31:24.222
You haven't spoken for
three entire minutes.

31:24.222 --> 31:26.057
Something is wrong.

31:26.057 --> 31:27.726
I'm fine.

31:30.795 --> 31:33.098
Would you like to talk about it?

31:34.733 --> 31:36.768
Seriously?

31:36.768 --> 31:40.739
I am always serious. It is you
who has a problem being serious.

31:42.607 --> 31:44.009
You're right. I do.

31:44.009 --> 31:46.177
Something has changed.

31:46.177 --> 31:51.549
Lately you seem, uh, quoi, different.

31:51.549 --> 31:52.884
I don't know.

31:52.884 --> 31:54.552
Maybe I am.

31:54.552 --> 31:57.722
I don't know. I'm... so confused.

31:57.722 --> 31:58.890
About?

31:58.890 --> 32:01.860
Okay, this is gonna sound really stupid.

32:03.595 --> 32:06.665
But my friend doesn't want
to be friends with me anymore.

32:06.665 --> 32:08.600
I see.

32:08.600 --> 32:10.802
Is this friendship important to you?

32:10.757 --> 32:12.726
Actually, I think it's

32:12.726 --> 32:15.228
the single most important
thing in my life right now.

32:15.228 --> 32:17.197
Then I don't see a problem.

32:18.765 --> 32:22.602
You don't strike me as someone
who gives up very easily.

32:22.602 --> 32:23.703
Mm.

32:23.703 --> 32:25.071
You may be frequently inappropriate

32:25.071 --> 32:26.840
and overly confident...

32:26.840 --> 32:27.874
Uh, is there a compliment
in here somewhere?

32:27.874 --> 32:29.509
But you are not a quitter.

32:31.211 --> 32:34.714
If this relationship
truly matters, as you say,

32:34.714 --> 32:36.917
then I am sure you and
your plucky American spirit

32:36.917 --> 32:39.185
will find a way to keep it.

32:43.723 --> 32:46.159
Got a second?

32:46.159 --> 32:49.496
Of course. Come in.

32:49.496 --> 32:52.666
Sam Grey just, uh, canceled
his next appointment.

32:52.666 --> 32:54.501
He's not coming in anymore.

32:54.501 --> 32:56.670
Did he tell you why?

32:56.670 --> 32:58.071
He spoke to Lila.

32:58.071 --> 33:00.140
I... I called him back,
but he hasn't returned.

33:02.075 --> 33:04.044
Do you know him well?

33:05.145 --> 33:07.047
Sam?

33:07.047 --> 33:08.548
Not really.

33:08.548 --> 33:09.916
It doesn't matter.

33:09.916 --> 33:12.752
I shouldn't have asked. It just...

33:12.752 --> 33:14.087
I'm a little worried about him.

33:14.087 --> 33:17.757
He seemed really off-balance
when we spoke the other day.

33:17.757 --> 33:19.693
If he's not talking to me, I...
I hope he's talking to someone.

33:21.461 --> 33:23.830
Do you have any kind of
relationship with his mother?

33:27.100 --> 33:29.936
A bit.

33:34.674 --> 33:36.543
It might be worth a call.

33:43.550 --> 33:45.685
Please don't be mad at me. I can explain.

33:45.685 --> 33:47.053
There's nothing to explain.

33:47.053 --> 33:49.789
I told you not to come after
this money, and here you are.

33:49.789 --> 33:52.125
But I didn't do it for
me. I... I did this for us,

33:52.125 --> 33:53.793
so that you wouldn't have to work so hard

33:53.793 --> 33:55.562
and so that we could put some
money in Scottie's college fund.

33:55.562 --> 33:56.730
If you were so concerned about money,

33:56.730 --> 33:57.831
you should've went back to work.

33:57.831 --> 33:59.766
- I'm raising Scottie.
- April did both.

33:59.766 --> 34:02.602
Oh, don't include me in
this sick-ass conversation.

34:02.602 --> 34:04.738
Oh, please. I see the
life that you had with her.

34:04.738 --> 34:07.640
She got everything, and I got
nothing, and that's nor fair.

34:07.640 --> 34:08.775
I hope you're kidding.

34:08.715 --> 34:10.516
You got me. That was the deal.

34:10.516 --> 34:12.686
And by the way, this "amazing"
life you think I had...

34:12.686 --> 34:14.020
I didn't have it either,

34:14.020 --> 34:16.022
because my husband was
cheating on me with you.

34:16.022 --> 34:17.524
April, look...

34:17.524 --> 34:20.159
No. No. No. That's it. We're done here.

34:20.159 --> 34:22.395
Y'all can go back to the
Florida swamp you crawled out of.

34:22.395 --> 34:24.496
You both deserve each other.

34:24.496 --> 34:26.399
You're still dead,

34:26.399 --> 34:27.600
and you can go to hell.

34:36.543 --> 34:38.143
Hey.

34:38.143 --> 34:40.612
You're still here.

34:40.612 --> 34:43.083
Remember when we first saw this house?

34:43.083 --> 34:46.953
We'd been looking all
day and almost gave up.

34:46.953 --> 34:50.456
And then we took a wrong
turn and saw this one.

34:50.456 --> 34:51.558
And we knew.

34:51.558 --> 34:52.659
I knew.

34:52.659 --> 34:55.527
I had to convince you to go in.

34:55.527 --> 34:58.531
My heels were killing me.

34:58.531 --> 34:59.799
Yeah.

34:59.799 --> 35:01.701
And you walked the whole
place in your stockings.

35:01.701 --> 35:03.970
And then you lost your poker face

35:03.970 --> 35:06.139
and started placing all the furniture.

35:06.139 --> 35:10.610
We pictured raising our kids here

35:10.610 --> 35:13.513
and big Thanksgiving dinners.

35:15.882 --> 35:19.919
And putting a swing on
that tree in the front.

35:19.919 --> 35:22.589
When we walked into that room,

35:22.589 --> 35:25.091
we chose it to be the nursery.

35:26.993 --> 35:30.497
I still want that life that we dreamed of.

35:30.497 --> 35:32.098
Harry.

35:32.098 --> 35:33.700
I'm not sure what you're saying.

35:38.471 --> 35:41.074
We don't have to wait
for the paternity results.

35:42.876 --> 35:45.512
I'm keeping this baby.

35:45.512 --> 35:49.082
And I thought about waiting to tell you

35:49.082 --> 35:50.817
on the chance that it was yours,

35:50.817 --> 35:54.521
but that just seemed
like lying to you, and...

35:54.521 --> 35:57.590
I don't want to lie to you anymore.

35:59.759 --> 36:01.761
I love you...

36:04.597 --> 36:06.466
so much.

36:06.466 --> 36:09.135
And even

36:09.135 --> 36:10.570
if the worst happens,

36:10.570 --> 36:12.806
I still feel like we can work through this.

36:14.574 --> 36:16.810
I already told you I can't.

36:16.810 --> 36:20.447
I'm asking you to fight for us.

36:20.447 --> 36:21.514
Please.

36:21.514 --> 36:24.417
Please fight for us.

36:29.856 --> 36:32.392
I'm sorry, love, I just, I...

36:34.494 --> 36:36.463
I got no fight left.

36:59.216 --> 37:01.085
I made brunch.

37:01.085 --> 37:02.787
Well, actually, I didn't make it,

37:02.787 --> 37:05.189
but this way, we know it'll taste good.

37:07.358 --> 37:09.160
I know what you're trying to do.

37:09.160 --> 37:11.162
Get you drunk before noon?

37:11.162 --> 37:12.263
And it's very nice,

37:12.263 --> 37:14.765
but it does not change the way I feel.

37:14.765 --> 37:19.003
Yeah. About that, um, that's
actually not gonna work for me.

37:19.003 --> 37:21.072
Joss.

37:21.072 --> 37:24.709
The thing is I can't
not be friends with you.

37:24.709 --> 37:26.077
I'm not letting you end this.

37:26.077 --> 37:28.112
So, um, pico de gallo?

37:28.112 --> 37:29.914
You can't just decide that.

37:29.914 --> 37:33.884
No, but I can fight for
it, and if that means

37:33.884 --> 37:35.786
redefining the boundaries
of this relationship,

37:35.786 --> 37:38.189
then I can do that. Try
the guac. It's to die.

37:38.189 --> 37:41.592
Wait. Um, how can you do that?
What do you mean you can...

37:41.592 --> 37:43.694
I don't know.

37:43.694 --> 37:45.963
But why don't we just take
the emergency brake off

37:45.963 --> 37:48.632
and see where this thing goes.

37:48.632 --> 37:49.834
Okay?

37:49.834 --> 37:53.037
What exactly are you saying?

37:53.037 --> 37:55.039
Let's do it.

37:55.039 --> 37:57.675
Let's go for it.

37:57.675 --> 38:00.277
Do the whole relationship thing. Hmm?

38:00.277 --> 38:02.847
Who knows? Maybe you're right.

38:02.847 --> 38:06.350
Maybe I will be the most
fabulous girlfriend ever.

38:06.350 --> 38:08.052
Yeah.

38:09.754 --> 38:11.055
Yeah, maybe you will.

38:15.192 --> 38:16.927
Maybe you will.

38:23.968 --> 38:26.137
April, hi. Just checking in.

38:26.137 --> 38:27.371
Call me when you can.

38:27.371 --> 38:30.941
Are you alive? Call me. I'm worried.

38:30.941 --> 38:32.243
Hey, lady.

38:32.243 --> 38:34.145
I'm still here to kill
anyone you want me to.

38:34.145 --> 38:36.113
Call me.

39:56.927 --> 39:59.597
Room 236.

39:59.597 --> 40:00.798
Checking out?

40:00.798 --> 40:04.101
Actually, I'm extending my stay.

40:04.101 --> 40:05.002
All right.

40:05.052 --> 40:06.320
Hello, Elizabeth.

40:06.320 --> 40:08.255
You'll have to excuse me.

40:08.255 --> 40:10.291
I wasn't expecting company.

40:11.659 --> 40:12.927
How was Italy?

40:14.094 --> 40:15.696
Your housekeeper told me.

40:15.696 --> 40:18.132
I've been trying to reach you.

40:18.132 --> 40:20.401
Well, it was a last-minute trip.

40:20.401 --> 40:22.903
I'm sorry if I worried you.

40:22.903 --> 40:26.040
You did, but that's not why I'm here.

40:26.040 --> 40:27.942
I need to talk to you about Sam.

40:27.942 --> 40:29.843
What's wrong with Sam?

40:29.843 --> 40:31.845
Honestly, I'm not sure,

40:31.845 --> 40:35.282
but I'm concerned about
his emotional well-being.

40:35.282 --> 40:39.053
Since Thomas' death,
he's been struggling to...

40:39.053 --> 40:40.988
regain stability.

40:40.988 --> 40:43.958
He lost his father.

40:43.958 --> 40:46.093
I think struggling is perfectly normal.

40:46.093 --> 40:48.729
Yes, but in my professional opinion,

40:48.729 --> 40:52.166
he may need more support
from the people who love him,

40:52.166 --> 40:54.635
maybe even a grief
counselor with specialized...

40:54.635 --> 40:56.270
Hold on.

40:56.270 --> 40:58.772
Your professional opinion?

40:59.807 --> 41:02.743
Are you seeing Sam as a patient?

41:02.743 --> 41:04.011
No.

41:04.011 --> 41:05.412
Then I'm confused.

41:05.412 --> 41:06.981
How do you know what's going on with Sam?

41:06.981 --> 41:08.916
He's been contacting me.

41:08.916 --> 41:10.150
Why would he do that?

41:10.150 --> 41:11.852
I think it comforted him

41:11.852 --> 41:14.088
to know that I'd counseled his father.

41:14.088 --> 41:17.358
He was looking for someone to
talk to, thought I could help,

41:17.358 --> 41:21.399
but things have gradually
gotten out of hand.

41:21.399 --> 41:22.400
Out of hand how?

41:22.400 --> 41:27.104
Sam's...

41:27.104 --> 41:29.340
become infatuated with me.

41:32.476 --> 41:34.378
Surely you're overreacting.

41:34.378 --> 41:36.213
He thinks he's in love with me.

41:36.213 --> 41:37.281
He told you that?

41:37.281 --> 41:38.616
Yesterday.

41:42.820 --> 41:47.258
Maybe you could tell him
you were screwing his father.

41:47.258 --> 41:48.826
That should break the spell.

41:50.494 --> 41:53.431
You're not gonna try and deny it, are you?

41:55.132 --> 41:56.801
Because that would be embarrassing.
