WEBVTT

00:23.857 --> 00:25.817
Desk Sergeant:
IN EARLY, ANDY.

00:25.900 --> 00:27.944
YEAH. HOW'S IT GOING?

00:33.867 --> 00:36.411
[BREATHING HEAVILY]

00:38.413 --> 00:40.790
HEY. HOW'D HE DO
THROUGH THE NIGHT?

00:40.874 --> 00:42.834
HE SEEMED TO DO
ALL RIGHT.

00:42.917 --> 00:45.837
YOU KNOW, THIS GUY'S
NOT STUPID, YOU KNOW?

00:45.920 --> 00:49.632
THIS STORY IN THE BIBLE
AROUND WHAT HE SHOWED ME
YESTERDAY,

00:49.716 --> 00:52.135
HE SHOWS ME A GUY
GOING FORTH ON HIS ASS,
YOU KNOW?

00:52.218 --> 00:53.636
WHAT LEADS TO THAT,

00:53.720 --> 00:56.097
THE CHILD GOES OUT
TO HIS FATHER,

00:56.181 --> 00:57.766
AND WHILE HE'S
WITH HIS FATHER,

00:57.849 --> 01:00.518
HE GETS HURT AND THEN
AT HIS HOME HE DIES

01:00.602 --> 01:03.730
AND THEN THE HOLY MAN COMES,
AND HE TRIES TO MAKE
THE CHILD LIVE AGAIN

01:03.813 --> 01:05.440
AND BREATHE LIFE
INTO THE CHILD.

01:05.523 --> 01:07.442
YEAH, HUH?

01:08.443 --> 01:09.819
I'M--I'M JUST SAYING...

01:09.903 --> 01:15.408
BUT, UH, HE SPENT THE NIGHT
ALL RIGHT, THIS ISRAEL, HUH?

01:15.492 --> 01:16.785
YEAH.

01:16.868 --> 01:19.746
PROBABLY DIDN'T KEEP YOU UP
ANY WITH CONVERSATION.

01:26.878 --> 01:29.214
IT'S ANDY SIPOWICZ, ISRAEL!

01:35.345 --> 01:38.014
OH, GOD, NO!

01:39.182 --> 01:42.185
NO! NO! NO! HELP ME!
HELP ME IN THE CRIB!

01:42.268 --> 01:44.187
SOMEBODY IN THE CRIB HERE!

01:44.270 --> 01:46.356
OH, GOD, NO!
OH, GOD! GOD!

01:46.439 --> 01:49.150
OH, THIS IS TOO BAD!
OH, YOU POOR BASTARD!

01:49.234 --> 01:50.860
WHAT HAPPENED?

01:50.944 --> 01:52.153
HE HUNG HIMSELF!

01:52.237 --> 01:53.363
WHEN'D YOU
CHECK ON HIM LAST?

01:53.446 --> 01:55.156
ANDY, I CHECKED ON HIM
ABOUT 2 HOURS AGO.

01:55.240 --> 01:57.700
HE WASN'T A PRISONER.
HE WASN'T ON SUICIDE
WATCH.

01:57.784 --> 01:59.160
SHUT UP!
SHUT YOUR MOUTH!

01:59.244 --> 02:00.286
I'LL GET THEM
ON THE LINE.

02:00.370 --> 02:01.204
Andy: POOR GUY.

02:01.287 --> 02:03.206
POOR GUY.

02:03.289 --> 02:05.708
OH, POOR GUY.

03:35.340 --> 03:37.258
SORRY HOW THIS
TURNED OUT, ANDY,

03:37.425 --> 03:39.260
WITH THIS, UH,
HOMELESS GUY.

03:39.344 --> 03:41.054
SOME PASSAGE ON THE PAGE
HE HAD THIS OPEN TO

03:41.137 --> 03:43.014
IS GOING TO EXPLAIN
THIS WHOLE SITUATION.

03:44.891 --> 03:46.351
Man: GRAB THE DOOR.

03:46.434 --> 03:48.353
Second man: YEAH,
HE CAN GO IN THERE.

03:53.316 --> 03:54.859
THIS GUY WAS NO DOPE.

03:57.445 --> 03:58.446
ANYWAYS.

03:58.529 --> 04:00.865
Bobby:
I'LL TELL THE BOSS, JAMES.

04:02.742 --> 04:04.202
LOOK, ANDY,

04:04.285 --> 04:06.246
BEING THAT
DIANA'S SUPPOSED TO MAKE
THIS CALL TO MRS. EGAN,

04:06.329 --> 04:07.789
DO WE NOTIFY THEM WHAT
HAPPENED TO THIS ISRAEL

04:07.872 --> 04:09.707
WITHOUT TALKING
TO THE BOSS ABOUT THIS?

04:09.791 --> 04:11.000
I DON'T KNOW.

04:11.084 --> 04:13.878
IF I DON'T MAKE THAT CALL
WHEN I SAID I WOULD,

04:13.962 --> 04:15.380
IT HURTS ME WITH HER.

04:15.463 --> 04:16.881
YEAH. I'M JUST WORRIED
YOU TELL HER THIS
ISRAEL'S DEAD,

04:16.965 --> 04:18.299
THE PART OF THAT WOMAN
THAT WANTS TO HIDE

04:18.383 --> 04:19.842
FROM WHAT HER HUSBAND DID,
THAT GETS REAL STRONG.

04:19.926 --> 04:21.678
WE GOT TO LAND HARD.
THE INVESTIGATION'S
STILL OPEN.

04:21.761 --> 04:23.012
OFF WHAT?

04:23.096 --> 04:24.222
LIE.

04:24.305 --> 04:26.432
TELL THEM THERE'S
NEW EVIDENCE.

04:43.032 --> 04:44.075
GOOD MORNING.

04:44.158 --> 04:45.493
GOOD MORNING.

04:47.370 --> 04:49.289
YOU FOUND US
ALL RIGHT?

04:49.372 --> 04:50.832
UH, YEAH, NO PROBLEM.

04:52.041 --> 04:53.334
Diane: GOOD MORNING,
SHERRIE.

04:53.418 --> 04:54.961
YOU REMEMBER MR. DAVIS?

04:55.044 --> 04:56.421
SURE. GOOD MORNING.

04:56.504 --> 04:59.465
YOU SAID YOU HAD
NEWS FOR THE EGANS.

04:59.549 --> 05:00.967
PLEASE, SIT--
SIT DOWN.

05:01.050 --> 05:02.093
THANKS.

05:02.176 --> 05:03.636
WOULD YOU LIKE
SOMETHING TO DRINK?

05:03.720 --> 05:06.139
I'D REALLY
APPRECIATE SOME
COFFEE, JUST BLACK.

05:06.222 --> 05:08.141
IF I COULD TROUBLE YOU
FOR SOME TEA.

05:08.224 --> 05:09.142
I'LL GET IT.

05:09.267 --> 05:10.435
THANK YOU.

05:15.732 --> 05:18.735
THAT'S WHERE THE PICTURES
OF OUR SON USED TO BE.

05:20.737 --> 05:23.906
WHAT IS IT YOU'VE
COME TO TELL US?

05:24.073 --> 05:25.867
DURING THE NIGHT
THE HOMELESS MAN

05:26.034 --> 05:28.578
WHO WAS A SUSPECT
IN BRIAN'S DEATH
HUNG HIMSELF.

05:28.661 --> 05:29.912
MY GOD.

05:29.996 --> 05:31.247
THERE'S YOUR CONFESSION.

05:31.331 --> 05:33.875
YOU CERTAINLY COULD
TAKE IT THAT WAY, YES.

05:33.958 --> 05:35.376
Steven:
HOW ELSE WOULD
YOU TAKE IT?

05:35.460 --> 05:37.003
OUR INDIFFERENT
AND CALLOUS SOCIETY

05:37.086 --> 05:38.463
CLAIMS ANOTHER
HELPLESS VICTIM?

05:38.546 --> 05:40.214
I ONLY MEANT THAT
HE DIDN'T LEAVE A NOTE

05:40.298 --> 05:41.257
OR THE LIKE.

05:41.341 --> 05:42.592
THAT'S HOW I PUT MY SON
IN HARM'S WAY,

05:42.759 --> 05:45.511
THAT TYPE OF SOFT-BELLIED
LIBERAL PUKE.

05:45.595 --> 05:48.514
IS IT IMPORTANT THAT
HE DIDN'T LEAVE A CONFESSION?

05:48.598 --> 05:50.475
DID YOU HEAR
WHAT DAN JUST SAID?

05:50.558 --> 05:53.019
WHAT'S MORE OF A CONFESSION
THAN KILLING HIMSELF?

05:53.102 --> 05:55.021
DOES THAT CLOSE
THE INVESTIGATION?

05:55.104 --> 05:58.024
I DID HAVE ONE KIND
OF A HOUSEKEEPING QUESTION

05:58.107 --> 06:00.943
THAT I'D LIKE TO BE ABLE
TO PUT TO MR. EGAN.

06:01.027 --> 06:02.487
ARE YOU UP
TO THAT?

06:02.570 --> 06:03.654
GO AHEAD.

06:03.780 --> 06:05.698
WHEN YOU CAME BACK
TO THE STATION HOUSE

06:05.782 --> 06:08.409
WHEN YOU REMEMBERED
ABOUT THE PLACE THAT
ISRAEL SLEPT...

06:08.493 --> 06:09.952
WHERE YOU FOUND
BRIAN'S SHIRT.
WHAT ABOUT IT?

06:10.036 --> 06:12.455
ACTUALLY IT WAS YOU
THAT FOUND BRIAN'S SHIRT.

06:12.538 --> 06:14.040
I WAS TRYING
TO SPARE YOU

06:14.123 --> 06:15.333
THE EMBARRASSMENT
OF BEING REMINDED.

06:15.500 --> 06:17.377
WHEN YOU AND I WENT THERE,

06:17.460 --> 06:19.921
WAS THAT THE FIRST
THAT YOU HAD BEEN
BACK TO THAT PLACE

06:20.004 --> 06:22.048
SINCE YOU AND YOUR SON
HAD BEEN THERE WITH ISRAEL?

06:22.131 --> 06:23.091
YES.

06:23.174 --> 06:24.092
YES, YOU HADN'T
BEEN BACK THERE?

06:24.175 --> 06:25.176
THAT'S RIGHT.

06:25.259 --> 06:26.677
WHY DO YOU ASK?

06:26.761 --> 06:29.305
WELL, WE DID A CANVASS
ON THAT BLOCK, AND--

06:29.389 --> 06:30.431
Diane:
THAT'S SORT OF LIKE
COLD CALLING.

06:30.515 --> 06:31.516
QUESTIONING PEOPLE
IN A GIVEN AREA,

06:31.599 --> 06:33.226
HOPING TO COME UP
WITH LEADS.

06:33.309 --> 06:35.228
Bobby: THERE WAS
ANOTHER STREET PERSON

06:35.311 --> 06:37.313
TOLD US THAT HE HAD
SEEN SOMEONE AROUND
THAT STOOP

06:37.397 --> 06:40.149
EARLY YESTERDAY MORNING
WHO MORE OR LESS FIT
YOUR DESCRIPTION.

06:40.233 --> 06:43.236
WHAT THE HELL DO YOU MEAN
BY TELLING US SOMETHING
LIKE THAT?

06:43.361 --> 06:44.987
I ONLY WANT TO TRY
TO GET IT ON THE RECORD

06:45.071 --> 06:46.989
THAT THE PERSON SEEN
WASN'T YOU, AND THEN
WE CAN JUST PUT IT TO BED.

06:47.073 --> 06:50.284
HOW MANY PEOPLE
IN MANHATTAN DO YOU FIGURE,

06:50.368 --> 06:52.245
MORE OR LESS,
FIT MY DESCRIPTION?

06:52.328 --> 06:54.163
WELL, AS FAR AS THAT GOES,
MR. EGAN, WHAT WOULD BE
SIGNIFICANT

06:54.247 --> 06:57.625
WAS SOMEONE FITTING
THAT DESCRIPTION BEING
IN THAT AREA

06:57.708 --> 07:00.628
AND ACTING LIKE HE WAS
PLANTING SOMETHING
UNDER THE STOOP,

07:00.711 --> 07:03.464
BUT IF YOU SAY
YOU WEREN'T THERE,

07:03.548 --> 07:05.258
WELL, THEN
THAT'S THE END OF IT.

07:05.341 --> 07:06.551
DO YOU WANT ME
TO SAY IT AGAIN?

07:06.634 --> 07:07.635
Bobby: NO.

07:07.718 --> 07:09.095
NOT NECESSARY.

07:09.178 --> 07:10.888
THE EGANS HAVE BRIAN'S
ARRANGEMENTS TO SEE TO.

07:10.972 --> 07:13.891
I THINK THAT OUGHT TO END
THE CONVERSATION.

07:13.975 --> 07:15.143
SHERRIE, CAN YOU
THINK OF ANYONE

07:15.226 --> 07:16.686
WHO WOULD DO
SOMETHING LIKE THAT?

07:16.769 --> 07:18.646
PLANT EVIDENCE
INCRIMINATING
ISRAEL?

07:18.729 --> 07:20.022
I CAN'T, NO.

07:20.148 --> 07:21.441
THIS IS PRETTY REMARKABLE.

07:21.524 --> 07:22.942
I MEAN, THE SUSPECT
HANGS HIMSELF--

07:23.025 --> 07:24.360
I HOPE THIS IS
THE LAST TIME

07:24.444 --> 07:25.987
I LEARN YOU'VE
CONTACTED THE EGANS

07:26.070 --> 07:27.196
WITHOUT NOTIFYING ME.

07:27.280 --> 07:29.115
OH, I ASSUMED IF MR. EGAN
WANTED YOU HERE,

07:29.198 --> 07:30.533
HE WOULD HAVE
NOTIFIED YOU HIMSELF.

07:30.616 --> 07:32.326
WHICH HE DID.
WHAT I'M SAYING IS,

07:32.410 --> 07:33.619
I'D LIKE YOU TO NOTIFY ME.

07:33.703 --> 07:34.579
ABSOLUTELY.

07:34.662 --> 07:36.998
WILL YOU KEEP IN TOUCH
IN THE COURSE OF THE DAY?

07:37.081 --> 07:38.166
OF COURSE I WILL.

07:38.249 --> 07:40.251
WHAT DID DAN
JUST SAY?!

07:40.334 --> 07:43.045
I JUST MEANT
WITH INFORMATION.

07:43.129 --> 07:46.674
IF THEY HAVE
INFORMATION FOR US.

07:46.757 --> 07:48.801
FINE. GREAT.

07:48.885 --> 07:51.053
I'LL WANT TO BE
NOTIFIED ABOUT
THOSE CALLS AS WELL.

07:51.179 --> 07:52.346
I WILL.

07:52.430 --> 07:53.389
THE POINT IS,

07:53.473 --> 07:54.849
WHATEVER HOUSEKEEPING
YOU HAVE LEFT,

07:54.932 --> 07:56.851
IF THE MAN WHO
DID THIS IS DEAD,

07:56.934 --> 07:58.811
WE'D LIKE TO DO OUR BEST
TO GET ON WITH OUR LIVES.

07:58.895 --> 07:59.854
WE UNDERSTAND.

07:59.937 --> 08:01.397
WE APPRECIATE
YOU'RE SEEING US.

08:01.481 --> 08:02.565
DO YOU WANT THAT?

08:04.609 --> 08:06.527
UH, NO. THANK YOU.

08:06.611 --> 08:08.070
YOU TAKE CARE, SHERRIE.

08:08.154 --> 08:10.072
THANKS FOR TRYING
TO HELP US.

08:10.156 --> 08:13.159
WE WANT TO HELP
AS MUCH AS WE CAN.

08:20.041 --> 08:24.420
WE KNOW HOW YOU FEEL
ABOUT US PUTTING YOU
THROUGH THIS, MR. EGAN.

08:24.504 --> 08:26.631
I'D REACT THE SAME WAY.

08:26.714 --> 08:30.968
I'VE GOT A LOT OF RESPECT
FOR HOW YOU'RE HANDLING
YOURSELF.

08:31.052 --> 08:32.470
ALL RIGHT.

08:32.553 --> 08:34.305
THANK YOU.

08:54.992 --> 08:58.287
THINK YOU DID ANY GOOD
WITH THE PARENTS?

08:58.371 --> 09:00.289
I TOLD THEM SOMEONE
WHO MATCHED STEVE'S
DESCRIPTION

09:00.373 --> 09:01.457
WAS SEEN LEAVING
THE STOOP

09:01.541 --> 09:03.000
WHERE WE FOUND
BRIAN'S SHIRT.

09:03.084 --> 09:04.460
THAT'S GOOD.
THAT'S GOING TO KEEP
HER DOUBTS OPEN.

09:04.544 --> 09:06.963
WELL, IF IT DON'T,
WE'RE IN TROUBLE, ANDY.

09:12.635 --> 09:15.471
YOU STILL LOOKING
FOR ISRAEL'S MESSAGE?

09:15.555 --> 09:17.723
IT'S THERE,
BUT I DON'T--
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

09:17.807 --> 09:19.767
PSALMS 119. I--

09:20.810 --> 09:23.145
I CAN'T MAKE OUT
THE APPLICATION

09:23.229 --> 09:26.148
'CAUSE--AHEM--
'CAUSE IT'S NOT
IN MY HEART.

09:26.232 --> 09:28.276
YOU WANT TO TALK
TO A BIBLE EXPERT,

09:28.359 --> 09:29.777
RUN IT BY HIM?

09:31.445 --> 09:33.030
WHOA!

09:33.114 --> 09:34.949
WHAT, SHE SEEING
SOMETHING FRESH?

09:35.032 --> 09:36.659
THE MOTHER CALLED.
SHE WANTS TO SEE ME.

09:36.742 --> 09:38.494
YOU DID IT.
THAT'S YOUR BREAK.

09:38.578 --> 09:39.996
WHEN ARE YOU
SUPPOSED TO GO?

09:40.079 --> 09:41.706
SHE WANTS TO SEE ME
RIGHT AWAY.

09:41.789 --> 09:43.165
HOW YOU GOING TO PUT
A BAG ON THE HUSBAND?

09:43.249 --> 09:44.667
SHE'S COMING ALONE.

09:44.750 --> 09:45.876
GOOD LUCK.

09:45.960 --> 09:47.128
YEAH.

10:08.441 --> 10:09.525
HI.

10:09.609 --> 10:11.068
HI, DIANE.

10:14.822 --> 10:16.866
WOULD IT MAKE MORE SENSE
TO GO SOME OTHER PLACE,

10:16.949 --> 10:19.869
SINCE YOU AND STEVE
COME HERE SOMETIMES?

10:19.952 --> 10:22.371
IF I HAD TOLD HIM I WAS
GOING SOMEWHERE ELSE,

10:22.455 --> 10:24.290
HE'D HAVE COME WITH ME.

10:26.000 --> 10:29.211
I DO COME HERE
BY MYSELF SOMETIMES

10:29.295 --> 10:31.756
AND DO
CROSSWORD PUZZLES,

10:31.839 --> 10:35.468
WAITING FOR BRIAN'S
SCHOOL TO LET OUT.

10:35.551 --> 10:37.345
USED TO.

10:37.428 --> 10:40.640
WHAT DID YOU WANT
TO TALK TO ME ABOUT?

10:46.896 --> 10:51.317
DO YOU BELIEVE
THAT SOMEONE ELSE
KILLED BRIAN?

10:52.902 --> 10:56.238
SHERRIE, SO MANY DETECTIVES
WHO INTERVIEWED THIS ISRAEL

10:56.322 --> 10:58.324
FELT HE WAS GENUINELY
DISTRAUGHT

10:58.407 --> 11:01.243
WHEN HE HEARD WHAT
HAD HAPPENED TO BRIAN.

11:01.327 --> 11:04.038
HE WAS MOANING AND WHIMPERING
LIKE SOME HURT ANIMAL,

11:04.121 --> 11:05.623
JUST HOLDING HIS BIBLE
TO HIM.

11:05.706 --> 11:07.750
AND SO SAD.

11:07.833 --> 11:10.753
AND THEY DIDN'T FEEL
HE WAS ACTING?

11:10.836 --> 11:14.298
THESE DETECTIVES HAVE
A GOOD SENSE ABOUT
THOSE THINGS.

11:14.382 --> 11:16.759
THEY FELT ISRAEL
WAS HONESTLY UPSET

11:16.842 --> 11:20.429
AND HE DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO BRIAN,

11:20.513 --> 11:22.098
AND THEY DIDN'T THINK
HE WAS INVOLVED.

11:22.181 --> 11:25.601
THAT'S WHY THEY'RE
CONSIDERING THIS OTHER IDEA.

11:25.685 --> 11:27.770
IF ISRAEL WASN'T INVOLVED,

11:27.853 --> 11:30.773
THEN SOMEONE MUST
HAVE ARRANGED ALL
OF THE EVIDENCE AGAINST HIM.

11:30.856 --> 11:32.525
I TOLD YOU
AT OUR APARTMENT,

11:32.608 --> 11:36.445
I--I CAN'T THINK
WHO THAT WOULD BE.

11:36.529 --> 11:38.948
YOU DON'T KNOW OF ANYONE

11:39.031 --> 11:41.283
OR YOU CAN'T LET YOURSELF
THINK ABOUT IT?

11:41.367 --> 11:44.870
THE FORMER.
I DON'T KNOW ANYONE.

11:44.954 --> 11:45.955
HERE'S YOUR WATER.

11:47.540 --> 11:48.624
UM...

11:50.418 --> 11:54.004
I TOLD YOU YESTERDAY THAT
I LOST A FAMILY MEMBER
TO VIOLENCE.

11:54.088 --> 11:57.842
AND I REMEMBER
EVERYTHING IN ME JUST
WANTING TO SHUT OFF THE PAIN,

11:57.925 --> 11:59.635
TO JUST NOT THINK
ABOUT IT.

11:59.719 --> 12:03.806
IT WAS ALMOST LIKE
I COULDN'T THINK ABOUT IT.

12:03.889 --> 12:07.810
THAT'S WHY I ASKED YOU
WHAT I JUST DID BEFORE.

12:07.893 --> 12:09.562
IN MY CASE, SHERRIE,

12:09.645 --> 12:13.983
THAT WAS BECAUSE SOMEONE
IN MY OWN FAMILY
WAS RESPONSIBLE.

12:15.443 --> 12:16.861
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

12:16.944 --> 12:19.572
RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT?

12:19.655 --> 12:21.323
THE MURDER.

12:22.408 --> 12:24.076
IN MY CASE, SHERRIE,

12:24.160 --> 12:27.121
ONE FAMILY MEMBER
MURDERED ANOTHER.

12:27.204 --> 12:31.584
THE MURDERER TRIED
TO MAKE PEOPLE THINK
SOMEONE ELSE WAS RESPONSIBLE,

12:31.667 --> 12:34.837
AND FOR A WHILE,
I TRIED TO BELIEVE THAT,

12:34.920 --> 12:38.424
BECAUSE THE OTHER POSSIBILITY
WAS SO HORRIBLE.

12:39.467 --> 12:40.843
AND FINALLY...

12:40.926 --> 12:45.014
I MADE MYSELF
FACE THE TRUTH.

12:46.098 --> 12:47.183
HOW?

12:47.266 --> 12:49.393
'CAUSE I FINALLY REALIZED

12:49.477 --> 12:50.936
IF I DIDN'T,

12:51.020 --> 12:53.731
IT WAS LIKE I WAS
COMMITTING MURDER, TOO.

12:53.814 --> 12:55.274
OH, GOD.

12:55.357 --> 12:57.818
THE ONLY WAY
THE PERSON I'D LOST

12:57.902 --> 12:59.737
COULD STAY ALIVE
IN MY HEART

12:59.820 --> 13:02.615
WAS IF I MADE MYSELF
FACE THE TRUTH. OTHERWISE...

13:03.783 --> 13:06.243
HE WOULD DIE THERE, TOO.

13:07.369 --> 13:10.331
ALL I HAVE LEFT

13:10.414 --> 13:12.333
IS REMEMBERING

13:12.416 --> 13:14.043
MY BRIAN ALIVE.

13:15.127 --> 13:18.464
THE SON YOU CARRIED
AND HELD...

13:18.547 --> 13:20.466
AND DREAMED OF WATCHING GROW.

13:20.549 --> 13:22.718
[GROANING]
OH.

13:24.762 --> 13:25.930
[CRYING]

13:27.223 --> 13:30.726
ONLY THE TRUTH
KEEPS HIS MEMORY
WITH YOU, SHERRIE.

13:31.977 --> 13:34.396
OTHERWISE, YOU'RE GOING
TO LOSE HIM.

13:34.480 --> 13:35.898
[WHISPERING]
I lost him.

13:35.981 --> 13:37.441
I couldn't protect him.

13:37.525 --> 13:39.568
YOU'RE HIS MOTHER.
PROTECT HIM NOW.

13:39.652 --> 13:42.905
I WANT TO...

13:42.988 --> 13:46.242
PROTECT MY POOR SON.

13:46.325 --> 13:47.493
I...

13:47.576 --> 13:49.995
WHO DID THIS, SHERRIE?

13:51.080 --> 13:52.206
PROTECT BRIAN.

13:52.289 --> 13:54.500
Steven:
YOU LET GO OF HER!

13:55.501 --> 13:57.002
Steven:
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

13:57.086 --> 14:00.130
I--I WANTED
TO TALK TO HER.

14:00.214 --> 14:02.299
HASN'T SHE SUFFERED
ENOUGH?

14:02.383 --> 14:03.425
I'M NOT TRYING
TO HURT SHERRIE.

14:03.509 --> 14:04.885
YOU LIED TO ME,

14:04.969 --> 14:07.388
AND YOU DISOBEYED
OUR ATTORNEY'S
INSTRUCTIONS.

14:07.471 --> 14:10.307
WHY DOES YOUR WIFE NEED
YOURS OR YOUR LAWYER'S
PERMISSION

14:10.391 --> 14:12.309
TO GO OUT OF THE APARTMENT,
MR. EGAN?

14:12.393 --> 14:14.019
DON'T YOU PUT WORDS
IN MY MOUTH.

14:14.103 --> 14:15.771
SHE HARDLY NEEDS
MY PERMISSION,

14:15.855 --> 14:18.691
BUT I RESENT
BEING DECEIVED!

14:18.774 --> 14:20.025
I'M SORRY.

14:20.109 --> 14:22.778
I GUESS I'M JUST
A LITTLE HYPER-VIGILANT,

14:22.862 --> 14:24.280
WHAT WITH A LOVED ONE
LEAVING THE APARTMENT
A FEW DAYS AGO

14:24.363 --> 14:26.365
AND OUR NEVER SEEING HIM
AGAIN ALIVE!

14:26.448 --> 14:28.868
I JUST WANTED HER TO HELP.

14:28.951 --> 14:30.452
AND I SEE
SHE'S HELPED A LOT.

14:32.621 --> 14:34.748
I BELIEVE YOU'VE
BROKEN THE LAW,
DETECTIVE RUSSELL.

14:34.832 --> 14:37.167
I AGREED
TO INFORM YOUR LAWYER

14:37.251 --> 14:39.378
IF <i>I </i>WAS GOING
TO CONTACT SHERRIE.

14:39.461 --> 14:42.298
AND SHE CONTACTED YOU?

14:42.381 --> 14:44.717
SHERRIE, DO YOU WANT
TO SHARE YOUR CONCERNS
WITH STEVE?

14:44.800 --> 14:46.510
NO.

14:46.594 --> 14:48.679
DO YOU WANT
TO COME HOME
WITH ME?

14:52.892 --> 14:54.935
I AM SICK OF THIS.

14:55.019 --> 14:56.604
I HAVE FEELINGS, TOO.

14:56.687 --> 14:58.939
NOW, MAYBE YOU'RE WILLING
TO LET YOUR GRIEF BE
MANIPULATED THIS WAY,

14:59.023 --> 15:00.399
BUT I NEED TO HEAL!

15:00.482 --> 15:03.736
I AM NOT MANIPULATING
ANYONE, MR. EGAN.

15:03.819 --> 15:05.779
YOUR SON WAS MOLESTED
AND MURDERED,

15:05.863 --> 15:07.406
AND I'M GOING TO FIND OUT
WHO DID THAT.

15:07.489 --> 15:09.867
THE MAN WHO DID THAT
PASSED JUDGMENT
ON HIMSELF.

15:09.950 --> 15:12.161
IF YOU WEREN'T SATISFIED
WITH YOUR CASE
FOR LEGAL REASONS,

15:12.244 --> 15:13.871
MAYBE YOU SHOULD'VE
GUARDED HIM BETTER.

15:13.954 --> 15:16.957
WE ACCEPT HIS JUDGMENT,
AND NOW WE WANT TO BE
LEFT ALONE!

15:18.918 --> 15:20.336
I WON'T STOP LOOKING,
SHERRIE!

15:20.419 --> 15:22.671
I WON'T STOP
UNTIL YOU TELL ME TO!

15:22.755 --> 15:24.506
YOU INTERFERING BITCH!

15:24.590 --> 15:27.509
I'D LIKE TO HURT YOU
AS BADLY AS HE WAS HURT.

15:27.593 --> 15:28.719
KILL ME, YOU MEAN?

15:28.802 --> 15:30.179
YOU WANT TO KILL ME,
MR. EGAN?

15:30.262 --> 15:32.056
YOU GOT MURDER IN YOU?

15:37.645 --> 15:39.855
YOU TELL HER
TO LEAVE US ALONE!

15:41.607 --> 15:44.985
W-WE'RE GOING HOME.

15:49.907 --> 15:51.325
ALL RIGHT, SHERRIE.

15:51.408 --> 15:52.993
I UNDERSTAND
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.

16:21.063 --> 16:22.940
HE'S RIGHT HERE,
AND I'LL SEND HIM DOWN.

[HANGS UP PHONE]
STEVEN EGAN'S DOWNSTAIRS

16:25.526 --> 16:27.861
AND WOULD LIKE TO SEE
DETECTIVE SIMONE.

16:48.048 --> 16:49.717
MR. EGAN.

16:50.676 --> 16:52.136
HE'S NOT WITH ME.

16:52.219 --> 16:53.137
I'M SORRY.

16:53.220 --> 16:54.722
YOU WERE LOOKING
FOR MY LAWYER,

16:54.805 --> 16:55.848
AND I WAS SAYING
HE WASN'T WITH ME.

16:55.931 --> 16:57.224
WHAT CAN I DO
FOR YOU, SIR?

16:57.307 --> 16:59.685
DOES THE
LEFT HAND KNOW WHAT
THE RIGHT HAND'S DOING

16:59.768 --> 17:01.103
IN YOUR INVESTIGATIVE
UNIT, DETECTIVE SIMONE?

17:01.186 --> 17:03.605
I'M SORRY, SIR.
I DON'T FOLLOW.

17:03.689 --> 17:06.400
MY WIFE IS GOING
THROUGH A TIME

17:06.483 --> 17:08.527
OF EXTREME EMOTIONAL
FRAILTY AND TURMOIL.

17:08.610 --> 17:10.320
I UNDERSTAND THAT.

17:10.404 --> 17:12.656
PSYCHOLOGICALLY, SHE IS
HANGING BY A THREAD.

17:12.740 --> 17:14.742
MR. EGAN, UH...

17:15.743 --> 17:18.579
WHY DON'T WE GO IN HERE?

17:27.171 --> 17:31.008

PUT OUT ALL THE TIME.

TO GET SOMETHING
BACK IN.

17:38.390 --> 17:41.185
AT ANY RATE,

17:41.268 --> 17:43.687
I HOPE I MADE CLEAR
AT OUR LOFT

17:43.771 --> 17:45.481
I WAS NOT THE PERSON

17:47.608 --> 17:50.194

AT LEAST,

17:50.277 --> 17:52.196
I HOPE I PUT THAT
TO REST.

17:52.279 --> 17:54.031
YOU MADE THAT
REALLY CLEAR.

17:54.990 --> 17:56.033
AHEM.

17:57.451 --> 17:59.828
I'M ALSO GOING
TO CONFIDE SOMETHING

TO THIS POINT.

18:01.622 --> 18:03.707
IN A SENSE,
IT'S MY OWN BURDEN

18:03.791 --> 18:06.668
AND NOT SPECIFICALLY
RELEVANT TO THE CASE.

18:08.629 --> 18:09.922
PLEASE.

18:12.341 --> 18:14.468
WHEN I WAS A CHILD...

18:16.136 --> 18:19.098
I WAS ABUSED MYSELF.

18:21.100 --> 18:22.726
THAT RIGHT?

18:23.811 --> 18:26.897
I'M NOT SURE
IF YOU CAN UNDERSTAND

18:26.980 --> 18:30.651

THAT MUCH MORE
HORRIBLE.

TO A SLEEPAWAY CAMP.

THAN ANY OTHER KID THERE.

IN MY BUNK SO HOMESICK
I COULDN'T STOP CRYING.

19:54.568 --> 19:57.529

I THINK A LOT MORE KIDS
ARE THAN PEOPLE KNOW.

20:11.251 --> 20:13.170
SO I'D BE LYING THERE,

20:13.253 --> 20:15.756
HOMESICK AND HUMILIATED.

20:17.174 --> 20:22.221
AND ONE NIGHT, UNCLE GILL
WAS ON NIGHT DUTY.

20:22.304 --> 20:25.182
THEY CALLED
ALL THE COUNSELORS
"UNCLE."

20:25.265 --> 20:27.392

20:30.145 --> 20:31.480
WHEN HE SHINED
HIS FLASHLIGHT,

20:31.563 --> 20:33.649

OVER MY HEAD WHEN I CRIED.

AND PUT IT BETWEEN HIS LEGS.

I DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT IT WAS ABOUT.

WHAT HE WAS DOING.

20:48.705 --> 20:50.457
ALL I KNEW WAS
HOW HOMESICK I WAS,

20:50.540 --> 20:52.292
AND HE WAS THE ONLY ONE
WHO HELPED ME,

20:52.376 --> 20:55.003

THAT I DIDN'T LIKE IT.

IS TO BEAT THIS,

TO GIVE THAT UP.

35:16.697 --> 35:18.825
WHERE PEOPLE THINK I'M SOME
INSANE PREDATORY MONSTER?

35:18.908 --> 35:20.284
THAT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN,
MY FRIEND.

35:20.368 --> 35:22.912
THERE'S FORGIVENESS
FOR EVERYONE INVOLVED
IN THIS, STEVE.

35:22.995 --> 35:26.749
I TOLD YOU MY PLANS,
MY FRIEND, SO PLEASE
GET OUT OF MY WAY.

35:30.419 --> 35:33.339
I'M NOT PREPARED
TO DISPUTE YOU ARE
MY FRIEND,

35:34.090 --> 35:35.591
AND I COULD USE A FRIEND
VERY MUCH.

35:35.675 --> 35:37.844
BUT AT THE SAME TIME,
YOU ARE A DETECTIVE,

35:37.927 --> 35:39.679
WHOSE JOB IS
ATTRIBUTING GUILT.

35:39.762 --> 35:41.681
THAT IS FOR LAWYERS
AND THE COURTROOM.

35:41.764 --> 35:43.349
I AM TRYING TO
UNDERSTAND
WHAT HAPPENED HERE.

35:43.432 --> 35:45.434
I THOUGHT YOU WERE TRYING
TO FORGIVE EVERYONE.

35:45.518 --> 35:48.855
YOU KNOW THERE'S
FORGIVENESS. YOU KNOW
THERE'S FORGIVENESS.

35:50.148 --> 35:52.191
I NEED YOU TO HELP ME
UNDERSTAND.

35:55.528 --> 35:57.530
WELL, I'M EXHAUSTED.

35:58.698 --> 36:00.825
AND I'M IN A STATE
OF HOPELESSNESS.

36:00.908 --> 36:02.493
IT'S ALL RIGHT.
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

36:03.369 --> 36:06.455
STEVE, YOU
BROUGHT ME HERE,

36:06.539 --> 36:08.708
AND I NEED YOU
TO TELL ME WHY.

36:10.251 --> 36:12.670
WELL, TO RECEIVE
THESE ACCUSATIONS
WHEN SO MUCH OF MY LIFE

36:12.753 --> 36:16.090
HAS BEEN CARING FOR BRIAN,
WHEN WE WERE SO CLOSE,

36:16.174 --> 36:18.259
AND AS MUCH AS I HAVE BEEN
WOUNDED AND HURT,

36:18.342 --> 36:21.262
I TRIED TO PROTECT HIM
FROM THAT. I TRIED...

36:21.345 --> 36:23.556
TO SHOW HIM HOW
MUCH HE WAS LOVED.

36:23.639 --> 36:25.600
WERE YOU PHYSICAL
SHOWING YOUR AFFECTION?

36:25.683 --> 36:27.310
WAS I PHYSICAL?

36:27.393 --> 36:32.273
WE ALL WANT TO BE PERFECT
PARENTS AND SHOW OUR LOVE
IN THE PERFECT WAY.

36:32.356 --> 36:35.776
AND AT THE SAME TIME,
WE'RE HUMAN BEINGS, AND SO
WHICH DO YOU SACRIFICE?

36:35.860 --> 36:40.114
DO YOU STOP TRYING TO SHOW
YOUR LOVE AT ALL IF YOU CAN'T
SHOW IT IN THE PERFECT WAY?

36:40.198 --> 36:44.202
DO YOU STOP BEING A PARENT
TO YOUR ONLY SON AND CHILD?

36:47.205 --> 36:48.664
BELIEVE ME,
FOR ME TO UNDERSTAND

36:48.748 --> 36:52.168
TAKES EVERY FIBER
OF ASKING GOD...

36:54.378 --> 36:57.673
TO UNDERSTAND
HIS FORGIVENESS TAKING BRIAN
AND UNDERSTANDING HIS WILL.

36:57.757 --> 37:00.176
WAS IT GOD WHO ASKED YOU
TO PUT BRIAN IN HEAVEN?

37:00.259 --> 37:04.764
I AM NOT SO PRESUMPTUOUS
OR EGOTISTICAL TO PRETEND
I COMMUNICATE WITH GOD.

37:07.391 --> 37:08.809
WHAT I DO KNOW...

37:09.769 --> 37:11.938
IS WHAT'S NECESSARY
FOR LIFE NOT TO BECOME

37:12.021 --> 37:15.483
A GROTESQUE INSANITY AND
TO PROTECT A CHILD YOU LOVE.

37:16.484 --> 37:20.321
I KNOW THE BURDEN
OF WHAT HAS TO BE DONE...

37:23.115 --> 37:25.284
BECAUSE PREVIOUSLY...

37:25.368 --> 37:31.624
YOU CAN'T FORGIVE YOURSELF,
AND YOU'VE BEATEN THAT IN HIM.

37:33.167 --> 37:36.462
YOU CAN'T FORGIVE YOUR
OWN ERECTION LYING NEXT
TO YOUR COUNSELOR,

37:36.545 --> 37:38.631
AND YOU KNOW
YOU MUST BE FOUL.

37:39.674 --> 37:41.842
AND SO YOU BEAT YOURSELF
AND YOUR BOY.

37:43.427 --> 37:46.681
I DON'T PRESUME
TO COMMUNICATE WITH GOD.

37:49.016 --> 37:52.395
BUT CAN YOU BELIEVE
IN ANY GOD...

37:52.478 --> 37:55.856
WHO DIDN'T WANT HIS CHILD
PROTECTED WHEN HE SEES HIM

37:55.940 --> 37:58.943
CRYING AT NIGHT
AND WETTING HIMSELF?

37:59.026 --> 38:00.861
IT'S A MONSTER...

38:00.945 --> 38:05.449
MAKING HIM LIE AND HIDE
AND BE SO SAD AND AFRAID.

38:05.533 --> 38:08.869
HOW WOULDN'T GOD
WANT HIM TAKEN AWAY?!

38:31.726 --> 38:32.727
KILL ME.

38:32.810 --> 38:34.979
PLEASE, PLEASE.

38:35.062 --> 38:37.064
SHOOT ME IN THE HEAD.

38:41.569 --> 38:42.778
I CAN'T.

38:49.994 --> 38:51.495
HELP ME CONFESS.

38:54.749 --> 38:57.752
HURRY AND GET
THE PENCIL AND PAPER.

39:03.549 --> 39:06.635
I'VE LOOKED FOR HIM,
AND I DON'T KNOW
WHERE HE IS.

39:06.719 --> 39:08.054
HE'S RIGHT THERE.

39:08.137 --> 39:09.472
WHERE'S STEVE EGAN?

39:09.555 --> 39:11.057
HE'S IN THE
OBSERVATION ROOM.

39:11.140 --> 39:13.059
I DIDN'T THINK
TO LOOK THERE.

39:13.142 --> 39:14.852
MR. EGAN JUST CONFESSED.

39:16.062 --> 39:18.147
HE WANTS TO GIVE
A WRITTEN STATEMENT.

39:19.315 --> 39:21.317
WE'LL SEE WHAT HE
WANTS TO GIVE.

39:23.319 --> 39:25.654
LET'S GO LOCK THIS SON
OF A BITCH IN A CLOSET.

39:25.863 --> 39:28.824
YEAH. HE CAN WRAP HIMSELF
AROUND EGAN ALL HE LIKES.

39:28.908 --> 39:32.745
THAT GUY JUST CONFESSED
TO ME, AND I CAN TESTIFY
TO THAT IN COURT.

39:32.828 --> 39:34.622
WHY DID HE SAY
HE KILLED HIS BOY?

39:34.747 --> 39:36.791
HE SAID THAT GOD
WANTED HIM TO DO IT,

39:36.874 --> 39:39.460
SO THAT HE WOULD STOP
ABUSING BRIAN.

39:39.543 --> 39:43.381
AND GOD WANTED HIM
TO FRAME THIS POOR,
HOMELESS BASTARD?

39:43.506 --> 39:45.508
AND THE WHOLE TIME I'M TRYING
TO DRAW THIS PRICK OUT,

39:45.591 --> 39:46.801
"YOU CAN TRUST ME.

39:46.884 --> 39:49.595
GOD IN HEAVEN HAS
FORGIVENESS FOR ALL OF US."

39:49.720 --> 39:52.223
THERE'S NO FORGIVENESS
FOR WHAT HE DID.

39:52.306 --> 39:54.058
HE IS GONNA BURN
IN HELL FOR THIS!

39:54.141 --> 39:55.810
BUT FIRST I WANT HIM
TO LIVE A GOOD, LONG TIME,

39:55.893 --> 39:59.021
SO HE CAN WAKE UP CRYING
AND SCREAMING ALL NIGHT
REALIZING WHAT HE DID.

39:59.105 --> 40:00.689
HE WANTS ME TO SHOOT HIM?!

40:00.773 --> 40:03.651
I HOPE THAT WAS HIM KNOWING
THAT THERE IS NO FORGIVENESS
FOR THAT.

40:03.776 --> 40:06.070
HE ASKED YOU TO SHOOT HIM?

40:06.153 --> 40:08.656
HE WAS ASKING
THE WRONG GUY.

40:11.784 --> 40:14.703
MRS. EGAN WANTS
TO GIVE A STATEMENT

40:14.787 --> 40:16.705
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED
TO BRIAN.

40:16.789 --> 40:19.041
MR. EGAN IS HERE, ALSO.

40:19.125 --> 40:22.545
HE SAID HE WANTED TO GIVE
A STATEMENT AS WELL.

40:22.628 --> 40:24.588
WHAT DID HE
WANT TO SAY?

40:26.006 --> 40:28.717
HE JUST CONFESSED TO ME
VERBALLY, MRS. EGAN.

40:28.843 --> 40:31.679
HE CONFESSED
THAT HE KILLED BRIAN.

40:33.973 --> 40:36.851
THAT HE ABUSED
AND KILLED YOUR SON, YES.

40:36.976 --> 40:39.895
MR. DAVIS IS IN
WITH HIM RIGHT NOW.

40:39.979 --> 40:44.108
I HOPE WHEN THEY'RE THROUGH,
HE'LL WRITE OUT WHAT HE SAID.

40:44.233 --> 40:46.152
HE'D BETTER WRITE IT OUT.

40:46.235 --> 40:50.781
A-A-AND I WANT TO WRITE OUT
THAT I MUST'VE COLLABORATED.

40:50.865 --> 40:52.908
I--I HAVE TO CONFESS IT.

40:52.992 --> 40:56.078
I--I MUST NOT HAVE WANTED
TO PROTECT BRIAN.

40:56.162 --> 40:58.664
NO. SHERRIE, THAT
ISN'T RIGHT. NO.

40:58.747 --> 41:04.044
SOMETIMES PEOPLE
THAT DO SOMETHING HORRIBLE
KNOW HOW BAD IT IS,

41:04.170 --> 41:06.589
AND THEY HIDE IT VERY GOOD.

41:06.672 --> 41:11.427
THINKING WE'LL DIE
IF WE BELIEVE IT...

41:11.510 --> 41:14.638
DOESN'T EXCUSE NOT BELIEVING,

41:14.722 --> 41:17.099
AND MAYBE WE SHOULD DIE.

41:17.183 --> 41:19.602
BRIAN WOULD HAVE NO ONE
TO REMEMBER HIM THEN.

41:19.685 --> 41:22.062
YOU HAVE TO
KEEP REMEMBERING
AND LOVING HIM.

41:22.188 --> 41:23.606
REMEMBERING
ALL HIS GOODNESS,

41:23.689 --> 41:25.941
REMEMBERING ALL THE JOY
HE BROUGHT YOU.

41:26.025 --> 41:27.943
I DON'T DESERVE
TO KEEP HIS MEMORY.

41:28.027 --> 41:29.445
I FAILED HIM.

41:29.528 --> 41:32.823
HE NEEDED ME TO PROTECT HIM,
AND I COULDN'T.

41:32.907 --> 41:35.743
HOW CAN I LIVE WITH MYSELF
AFTER THAT?

41:35.826 --> 41:37.286
Diane:
YOU HAVE TO, SHERRIE.

41:37.369 --> 41:38.871
YOU CAN DO IT.

41:38.996 --> 41:43.584
AHEM.
THIS HOMELESS ISRAEL
HAD HIS BOOK OPEN...

41:44.752 --> 41:47.796
IN A SECRET MESSAGE
TO US.

41:51.342 --> 41:52.551
[SOBBING]

41:58.724 --> 42:02.436
"MY SOUL FAINTETH
FOR THY SALVATION,

42:02.520 --> 42:07.316
"BUT I HOPE IN THY WORD.

42:07.399 --> 42:13.864
"MINE EYES FAIL
FOR THY WORDS SAYING,
WHEN WILL THOU COMFORT ME?

42:13.989 --> 42:18.327
"FOR I AM BECOME LIKE
A BOTTLE IN THE SMOKE,

42:18.410 --> 42:22.831
"YET, DO I NOT FORGET
THY STATUTES.

42:22.915 --> 42:26.335
"HOW MANY ARE THE DAYS
OF THY SERVANT?

42:26.418 --> 42:31.340
"WHEN WILL THOU
EXECUTE JUDGMENT ON THEM
THAT PERSECUTE ME?

42:31.423 --> 42:35.344
"THE PROUD
HAVE DIGGED PITS FOR ME

42:35.427 --> 42:38.347
"WHICH ARE NOT
AFTER THY LAW.

42:39.723 --> 42:43.352
"ALL THY COMMANDMENTS
ARE FAITHFUL.

42:43.435 --> 42:48.816
"THEY PERSECUTE ME WRONGFULLY.
HELP THOU ME.

42:48.899 --> 42:52.194
"THEY HAD ALMOST
CONSUMED ME UPON EARTH,

42:52.278 --> 42:56.824
"BUT I FORSOOK NOT
THY PRECEPTS.

42:56.907 --> 43:00.327
"QUICKEN ME
AFTER THY LOVING KINDNESS,

43:00.411 --> 43:04.915
SO SHALL I KEEP
THE TESTIMONY OF THY MOUTH."

43:16.927 --> 43:20.139
HE'S READY TO WRITE
A STATEMENT FOR YOU NOW.

43:21.307 --> 43:25.436
I WANT IT ON RECORD IT'S
AGAINST ADVICE OF COUNSEL.

43:26.729 --> 43:27.730
OK.

43:28.647 --> 43:31.650
WE'LL PUT THAT
ON THE RECORD, TOO.
