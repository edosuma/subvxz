00:02.377 --> 00:04.054
The fire started
in the middle of the night.

00:04.078 --> 00:05.412
They were trapped inside?

00:05.514 --> 00:07.380
Carson's been on pins, and...

00:07.449 --> 00:09.783
Jd's beside himself.

00:09.885 --> 00:11.618
<i>You figure you're gonna tell us.</i>

00:11.720 --> 00:14.754
What we should feel about
some people we don't even know!

00:19.828 --> 00:22.062
I've been getting
ivf treatments.

00:22.164 --> 00:24.598
I want the donor
to be somebody I know.

00:24.700 --> 00:26.399
You really want a kid that bad?

00:26.502 --> 00:27.767
Shae reese.

00:27.870 --> 00:30.103
We need her
to testify against her pimp.

00:30.205 --> 00:32.671
When's the trial gonna be?
Maybe nine months.

00:32.774 --> 00:34.908
We will get you into a shelter.

00:34.977 --> 00:37.010
How 'bout you come work
on the farm, get paid?

00:37.112 --> 00:38.223
You need beer... I got that.

00:38.247 --> 00:39.247
You want other stuff...

00:39.314 --> 00:40.547
I seen you going soft.

00:40.649 --> 00:42.093
For that fool
you brought to the farm.

00:42.117 --> 00:43.917
I'm not soft.

01:39.107 --> 01:42.175
There's a right time to labor.

01:42.277 --> 01:47.113
The book of lamentations 3:27
tells us,

01:47.215 --> 01:52.385
"it is good for a man that
he bear the yoke in his youth."

01:52.487 --> 01:54.321
If your time is spent well,

01:54.389 --> 01:58.291
Then you should be building
a better future for yourself.

01:58.393 --> 02:03.997
But too many people
just waste their time.

02:04.099 --> 02:05.999
They do shameful things.

02:06.101 --> 02:08.101
They throw away their money,

02:08.203 --> 02:12.238
And they have nothing left
when they get old.

02:12.307 --> 02:15.809
Stop wasting your life.

02:15.911 --> 02:20.981
Life is not about going
to parties and sinful clubs.

02:21.083 --> 02:23.149
That don't help you grow
as a person.

02:25.087 --> 02:28.922
Remember, it is god
who works the hardest.

02:29.024 --> 02:31.324
And the most in this world,

02:31.426 --> 02:34.027
And he will work for you.

02:34.129 --> 02:37.664
And in you and through you.

02:39.701 --> 02:43.403
If you leave this world without
laying a good foundation,

02:43.505 --> 02:46.172
Your children will curse you.

02:47.542 --> 02:48.808
God be with you.

02:48.910 --> 02:51.511
And with you.

03:01.923 --> 03:03.723
What the hell is going on?

03:03.825 --> 03:06.159
You need to look at the...
I've looked at them.

03:06.261 --> 03:09.763
You have put them in front
of my face every day for a week.

03:09.865 --> 03:11.765
Then what are
you going to do about it?

03:11.833 --> 03:13.533
What am I supposed to be doing?

03:13.635 --> 03:18.705
Well, those people
are our responsibility.

03:18.807 --> 03:20.740
How are they our...

03:20.842 --> 03:22.942
But you don't want
to acknowledge it?

03:23.045 --> 03:26.246
There's nothing to...
They weren't on our property.

03:26.348 --> 03:31.317
But you... you knew
how they were living,

03:31.386 --> 03:33.353
And you know...

03:36.925 --> 03:40.026
You know how they died...

03:40.095 --> 03:44.564
Trapped in...
In those... those...

03:51.239 --> 03:53.306
Hello?

03:55.744 --> 03:59.012
Why do you do this to yourself?

03:59.081 --> 04:02.449
I-I don't know why you do this.

04:08.356 --> 04:10.924
I'm...

04:15.497 --> 04:17.697
I'm gonna go.

04:19.401 --> 04:21.601
I'll see you tonight.

04:21.702 --> 04:23.203
Okay.

04:38.854 --> 04:40.854
Isaac!

04:48.730 --> 04:50.363
Yeah?

04:50.465 --> 04:52.365
What are you doing
with that white boy?

04:52.467 --> 04:54.467
We... we just talking.
That's it.

04:54.569 --> 04:56.603
Talking about what?

04:56.671 --> 04:59.739
Um, I mean, just how
he's doing, and that's it.

04:59.841 --> 05:01.018
You over there
running your mouth,

05:01.042 --> 05:03.309
And he ain't picking nothing.

05:03.378 --> 05:04.711
He's a little thug.
You know that.

05:04.813 --> 05:06.379
Sneaking around the farm
this morning.

05:06.448 --> 05:09.215
No, see, I-i told him to come
early and aerate the soil.

05:09.317 --> 05:10.317
Aerate the soil?

05:10.352 --> 05:12.585
Yeah. I pay... I pay him extra.

05:12.654 --> 05:15.221
You're paying him?

05:15.290 --> 05:18.158
Who says you can pay him?

05:18.260 --> 05:19.492
He works.

05:19.594 --> 05:20.627
Who says you can pay him?

05:20.695 --> 05:23.463
He just trying to earn
extra money. That's it.

05:24.766 --> 05:26.966
You're soft. You know that?

05:27.035 --> 05:29.068
He's a punk, and you...
You're throwing him money.

05:29.137 --> 05:30.970
So he can stay high?

05:31.072 --> 05:34.240
So he can take his white-trash
pills and stay lit up?

05:35.644 --> 05:37.477
Wait, y-you tell me
to make him work,

05:37.579 --> 05:38.778
And I make him work.

05:38.880 --> 05:40.792
And then... then you tell me
that he's not working enough.

05:40.816 --> 05:42.015
I mean, w-what do you want?

05:42.117 --> 05:44.417
I want you to think!

05:44.519 --> 05:45.985
You... you let a druggie
on the farm.

05:46.087 --> 05:48.354
You don't know
what he's gonna do.

05:48.456 --> 05:51.925
You trust people, man.

05:52.060 --> 05:53.960
You can't do that.

05:55.997 --> 05:58.631
Go. Go do some work.

06:03.138 --> 06:05.371
All right.

07:10.805 --> 07:12.171
Hey!

07:12.239 --> 07:13.839
No.

07:42.736 --> 07:44.369
I want you to know.

07:44.438 --> 07:47.439
That I talked
to laurie ann and jd.

07:47.508 --> 07:49.875
I called them
right after I talked to you,

07:49.944 --> 07:55.013
And they said that they are
gonna do a policy review?

07:55.082 --> 07:58.050
And they are gonna look
at subcontractor standards,

07:58.152 --> 08:00.352
And they're...
They're gonna review those.

08:00.421 --> 08:03.622
So things
are getting done, so...

08:03.724 --> 08:05.858
Can I help?

08:05.893 --> 08:08.060
God! Jeanette...
No, I just want to...

08:08.128 --> 08:09.728
<i>They are gonna do
a policy review.</i>

08:09.797 --> 08:11.129
<i>They are going to... no, it's...</i>

08:11.232 --> 08:16.034
Yeah, yeah. No, it's not
just about the accident.

08:16.070 --> 08:18.804
You asked me
why I feel the way I feel.

08:21.709 --> 08:25.143
Your father, his health...

08:25.212 --> 08:30.015
You all are doing more,
more, and I-i sit around.

08:30.117 --> 08:31.628
That's what I do all day.
I sit around.

08:31.652 --> 08:35.354
I sit here with these things
that are happening to you.

08:35.422 --> 08:40.993
So, here's... here's something
I could get involved with,

08:41.061 --> 08:44.263
Something I could do.

08:44.365 --> 08:47.933
That's all I'm asking. I'm...

08:48.002 --> 08:50.402
I'm asking
if I could do something.

08:50.504 --> 08:52.671
Jeanette...

08:52.773 --> 08:53.939
I will call jd.

08:54.008 --> 08:56.608
If you want to help,
you can help.

08:56.677 --> 09:00.779
I just...
I don't want all of this.

09:00.881 --> 09:03.448
To come between us.

09:10.124 --> 09:11.256
Oye...

09:11.358 --> 09:12.925
Luis, this is manuel.

10:11.552 --> 10:16.054
The first time you die,
it's kind of scary.

10:16.156 --> 10:18.957
No, it is... it is scary,
you know,

10:19.026 --> 10:20.592
'cause you know
what's happening.

10:20.661 --> 10:24.463
You shoot up, or you take
your pills or whatever,

10:24.531 --> 10:27.966
And... and you drop down,
you know?

10:28.068 --> 10:29.501
You drop down, same as always.

10:29.570 --> 10:32.571
You go into your... into
your hole, into your space.

10:32.673 --> 10:34.906
And...

10:35.009 --> 10:37.576
And when you die,
you just keep dropping.

10:37.644 --> 10:39.911
And you know you're dying,
and you try and fight it.

10:39.980 --> 10:41.646
You try and climb back up,
but you can't.

10:41.782 --> 10:42.782
And you're scared.

10:42.816 --> 10:46.485
You know, you're scared as hell.

10:46.587 --> 10:49.755
And, um, dying scared is...

10:49.857 --> 10:52.691
Well, what's that like?
What? Dying scared?

10:52.793 --> 10:55.127
It's dying scared.
That's what it is.

10:56.530 --> 10:57.562
You're... you're alone,

10:57.631 --> 11:00.065
And... and you got
nothing but fear.

11:00.134 --> 11:03.668
And then the paramedics
showed up, right, with narcan...

11:03.737 --> 11:07.873
And give you a shot
right up the nose.

11:07.975 --> 11:09.341
Right?

11:09.443 --> 11:12.110
Just like that, I'm all right.

11:12.179 --> 11:14.613
So what...
What we'd start doing is,

11:14.681 --> 11:17.049
We'd start shooting up right
around the firehouses, right?

11:17.117 --> 11:20.152
You o.D.? They're right there.

11:20.254 --> 11:21.664
Things get hectic,
they're right there.

11:21.688 --> 11:22.688
Just...

11:23.857 --> 11:25.657
It just got to be regular.

11:25.759 --> 11:27.793
I must have...

11:27.895 --> 11:32.631
I must have died
at least five times, for real.

11:32.733 --> 11:34.299
Not just... not just o.D.'d.

11:34.401 --> 11:40.138
Like, I must have died
for real like five times.

11:40.240 --> 11:42.841
Wow.

11:42.943 --> 11:45.510
You... you proud of yourself
for that?

11:45.612 --> 11:48.747
That you figured a way
to get yourself messed up?

11:48.816 --> 11:52.150
Just, -
just telling you how it is.

11:52.252 --> 11:53.819
When they was running crack
in the city,

11:53.921 --> 11:56.855
They didn't have any narcan.

11:56.924 --> 11:59.391
They let the mexicans die.

11:59.426 --> 12:01.660
They let the blacks die.

12:01.728 --> 12:03.695
Heroin comes into the suburbs,

12:03.764 --> 12:06.598
And all of a sudden,
they got magic powder.

12:06.700 --> 12:08.767
See, dying means something.

12:08.869 --> 12:11.136
And you act
like you can take it back.

12:11.238 --> 12:12.971
Dying's easy to you.
It's not easy.

12:13.006 --> 12:15.785
That's why you ain't never gonna be
nothing. What I deal with is not easy.

12:15.809 --> 12:17.554
'Cause the one thing
that matters the most...

12:17.578 --> 12:20.645
The one thing that matters...

12:20.714 --> 12:22.114
It means nothing to you.

12:22.216 --> 12:26.084
I work hard at getting
myself right every day.

12:26.153 --> 12:28.053
It's work to be regular.

12:28.155 --> 12:29.821
It's work to be clean.

12:29.923 --> 12:31.389
Think that's easy?

12:31.492 --> 12:33.725
What do you deal with
that's so hard?

12:33.827 --> 12:36.428
You know, there's a lot of...
Going on in this farm,

12:36.530 --> 12:39.097
And I don't... I don't see
you dealing with any of it.

13:11.833 --> 13:13.399
He was nice.

13:13.468 --> 13:14.767
Nicer than most.

13:14.836 --> 13:18.938
I went to the bathroom and
did everything that he wanted.

13:19.040 --> 13:22.141
He liked it. I could tell.

13:22.243 --> 13:26.078
And then when we were done,

13:26.114 --> 13:30.549
He grabbed me by the throat
and started strangling me.

13:30.618 --> 13:34.453
I was so high that I didn't
know what was going on.

13:34.522 --> 13:39.391
He bashed my head into
the tile floor over and over.

13:39.460 --> 13:42.428
And everything just went black.

13:42.497 --> 13:45.764
When I woke up the next day,
I was in the hospital.

13:45.800 --> 13:48.701
Someone had found me
and called the cops.

13:48.803 --> 13:52.104
I can't even believe
that I'm still alive.

13:52.173 --> 13:54.974
You know, the weirdest part is,

13:55.042 --> 13:57.376
He left the cash in my pocket...

13:57.445 --> 13:59.211
Like he wanted me to find it.

14:02.016 --> 14:04.183
Thank you, rafi.

14:04.252 --> 14:07.052
You are incredibly brave.

14:07.121 --> 14:11.757
I'm so glad that you're here
and that you're safe.

14:16.797 --> 14:19.064
Please.

14:19.133 --> 14:21.901
Go ahead.

14:22.003 --> 14:23.602
I'm shae.

14:25.940 --> 14:28.440
You know, my deal's the same.

14:28.543 --> 14:31.177
Not the same, but...

14:31.279 --> 14:32.645
Same kind.

14:36.684 --> 14:40.252
Before this,
I was living with my guy.

14:40.321 --> 14:43.789
He took care of me,

14:43.858 --> 14:49.261
Promised that I'd never have
to go back to my home.

14:49.363 --> 14:51.330
Or my dad...

14:54.168 --> 14:56.468
Or his girlfriend,
who made me have an abortion

14:56.537 --> 14:58.615
'cause she thought the only
reason I was having a baby.

14:58.639 --> 15:01.106
Was 'cause I wanted
the attention.

15:10.351 --> 15:13.752
Billy promised he would keep me
off the street, and he did.

15:17.124 --> 15:19.458
I know billy's done
some stuff that's messed up,

15:19.527 --> 15:25.364
But he's the only one
who ever gave me anything.

15:29.570 --> 15:31.337
I miss that.

15:33.641 --> 15:35.608
I miss him.

15:44.685 --> 15:46.652
I'm pregnant again.

15:49.223 --> 15:51.223
It's not billy's.

15:55.997 --> 15:58.097
And I'm not gonna keep it.

16:06.274 --> 16:10.976
But think about
if me and him had a baby,

16:11.045 --> 16:13.579
If he wasn't locked up...

16:13.681 --> 16:15.914
The three of us
could be together.

16:19.954 --> 16:22.988
Try and make a little family
or something.

16:26.594 --> 16:29.161
A little family would be good.

16:33.868 --> 16:37.636
Thank you, shae,
for your honesty.

17:06.834 --> 17:09.635
I think about it,
and I see there's a lot of good.

17:09.704 --> 17:11.737
That comes
from having a baby with you.

17:11.771 --> 17:15.007
Now, you're gonna have
to put your stuff in a tube.

17:15.076 --> 17:17.608
Because that's the closest
we're gonna get to...

17:17.712 --> 17:20.279
<i>Some good that comes with it.</i>

17:23.050 --> 17:26.785
But I really thought
about it, kimara.

17:31.192 --> 17:33.659
I can't be your sperm donor.

17:36.297 --> 17:38.397
Denise doesn't want you to...

17:38.499 --> 17:40.065
No, she's fine. Mnh-mnh.

17:40.167 --> 17:41.567
She gets it.

17:45.005 --> 17:47.673
So, what's holding you back?

17:47.708 --> 17:49.942
I can't have a baby
with someone I care about.

17:50.044 --> 17:53.312
And not be in your life,
in his or her life.

17:53.347 --> 17:55.125
Well, then be in our lives.
We can work it out.

17:55.149 --> 17:56.715
How? How? What... what...

17:56.784 --> 17:58.117
What, like a part-time dad?

17:58.219 --> 17:59.985
However you want to be involved.

18:00.087 --> 18:01.420
I would be splitting my time.

18:01.455 --> 18:03.655
Between my children
and your kid.

18:07.661 --> 18:09.862
Jason is...

18:09.964 --> 18:11.864
He's on his way off to college.

18:11.932 --> 18:14.433
And you don't have
to be involved.

18:14.502 --> 18:18.103
We can sign a contract...
No financial responsibility.

18:18.205 --> 18:19.645
What, you mean abandon
my child? I...

18:19.707 --> 18:23.075
You don't have to...
To disclose your identity.

18:24.512 --> 18:26.078
I'm asking just for...

18:26.180 --> 18:28.514
For a lifetime commitment.

18:28.616 --> 18:30.349
A good man.

18:30.451 --> 18:32.584
Look, you're struggling.
I'm ready.

18:32.620 --> 18:34.364
Look, you're getting by the best that
you can. I'm ready for this baby.

18:34.388 --> 18:36.789
I don't believe you can raise
this kid without my help.

18:36.857 --> 18:41.226
I... What, you don't
think I'm capable?

18:41.328 --> 18:43.595
Kimara, how you gonna pay
for daycare?

18:43.664 --> 18:46.298
What if you get
one of your calls?

18:46.367 --> 18:48.607
Someone needs your help, and
you've got to just take off.

18:48.702 --> 18:49.802
Then what?

18:49.904 --> 18:51.503
You leave the baby behind?

18:51.605 --> 18:53.672
Is this about my job?

18:53.774 --> 18:56.408
You forget why we broke up
in the first place.

18:56.510 --> 18:59.111
You were never there.

19:06.520 --> 19:11.957
You see
the way jason smiles at you?

19:12.059 --> 19:13.725
No one...

19:13.828 --> 19:16.361
No one else
will ever love you like that...

19:16.464 --> 19:18.464
Ever.

19:18.566 --> 19:21.200
I want to know
what that feels like, reggie.

19:21.302 --> 19:24.336
I want to be able to hold
that kind of love in my arms.

19:24.438 --> 19:27.306
I want to... I want to...

19:27.374 --> 19:30.642
I want to look
in my child's eyes,

19:30.711 --> 19:34.246
And I want to see
someone I care for.

19:34.315 --> 19:36.014
I'm sorry.

19:36.116 --> 19:38.183
I can't be the donor, kimara.

19:38.285 --> 19:39.918
I'm sorry. I...

19:40.020 --> 19:43.255
I can help with the loan
for the procedure, but...

19:58.239 --> 19:59.683
You're not supposed to have any
electronics at the shelter.

19:59.707 --> 20:00.772
It's not mine.

20:00.841 --> 20:03.041
It was found hidden
in your belongings.

20:05.346 --> 20:07.512
I stole it.

20:07.581 --> 20:08.614
Stole it from where?

20:08.716 --> 20:11.450
One of
the group-counseling sessions.

20:11.518 --> 20:13.685
You don't have to be here.
Laura...

20:13.754 --> 20:15.954
You don't have to be
at this shelter.

20:16.023 --> 20:17.656
There's a database of women.

20:17.725 --> 20:20.192
Who desperately need to escape
their circumstances.

20:20.294 --> 20:21.894
An actual database.

20:21.996 --> 20:24.796
That's how hard
rooms are to come by.

20:24.865 --> 20:26.698
And you treat this as if...

20:26.800 --> 20:29.401
Can you just let us
have a minute to talk?

20:29.503 --> 20:30.936
Just a minute.

20:39.046 --> 20:42.114
Shae, what were you thinking?

20:42.182 --> 20:46.151
Do you know how hard it was
for me to get you placed here?

20:46.220 --> 20:48.287
Who were
you even trying to call?

20:48.355 --> 20:49.955
Nobody. Billy?

20:50.057 --> 20:51.490
No.

20:51.525 --> 20:54.960
So you just stole a phone
to call nobody?

20:55.062 --> 20:56.428
I don't care about the phone.

20:56.497 --> 20:58.263
I just wanted to use the camera.

21:19.320 --> 21:23.088
What are they images of?

21:23.190 --> 21:26.425
I don't know.

21:26.493 --> 21:28.994
I just know they're beautiful.

21:32.232 --> 21:34.700
They're just not here.

21:37.571 --> 21:39.471
Y-you stole a phone.

21:39.573 --> 21:41.907
You're gonna have
to take it back.

21:43.077 --> 21:44.242
Do you want me to drive you?

21:44.345 --> 21:45.610
I'm cool.

21:45.679 --> 21:47.446
You sure you don't want
me to... I'm cool.

21:47.514 --> 21:49.681
They can take me.

22:22.516 --> 22:25.183
How are you?
Is that all for you today?

22:26.387 --> 22:27.552
Ooh!!

22:27.621 --> 22:28.653
Um... My fault.

22:28.756 --> 22:30.322
No, excuse me. I'm sorry.

22:30.424 --> 22:31.890
It's fine. No, no.

22:31.992 --> 22:33.158
Don't worry about it.

22:35.796 --> 22:37.963
Just in case.

22:48.308 --> 22:49.441
Jeanette.

22:49.543 --> 22:51.043
Hi, jd.

22:51.145 --> 22:52.978
Sorry.

22:53.080 --> 22:56.048
Sorry to keep you waiting.
That's all right.

22:56.116 --> 22:57.883
Day gets away
from you sometimes.

22:57.985 --> 22:59.351
I know you have a lot to do.

22:59.420 --> 23:01.086
Well...

23:03.190 --> 23:06.625
So, carson said
you were looking for some work.

23:06.660 --> 23:08.560
No. I mean no. Not work.

23:08.629 --> 23:10.395
Said you wanted
to get out of the house.

23:10.497 --> 23:13.765
Carson told me
that you and laurie ann.

23:13.834 --> 23:19.504
Were going,
to look at the... the situation.

23:19.606 --> 23:22.107
With the fire, and, um...

23:22.209 --> 23:24.176
And if there's something
I can do,

23:24.278 --> 23:26.011
If there are ways
that I could help,

23:26.113 --> 23:27.279
Um, I want to.

23:27.381 --> 23:28.480
I want to help.

23:28.582 --> 23:29.893
Carson said
we were looking into...

23:29.917 --> 23:32.717
Well, I don't... I don't know
how it works exactly,

23:32.786 --> 23:36.154
But that, you were
gonna do some kind of...

23:36.190 --> 23:40.192
Of review
of the people you work with.

23:40.260 --> 23:44.129
And how things
can be done better.

23:44.231 --> 23:47.866
And, um, I would like
to help with that.

23:49.403 --> 23:52.337
You know, look, laurie ann
already looked into things,

23:52.439 --> 23:55.440
And there's not much to it.

24:04.251 --> 24:07.786
You don't believe that.

24:07.855 --> 24:11.890
<i>You're the one who deals with
the subcontractors, not her.</i>

24:11.992 --> 24:13.458
Yeah.

24:13.560 --> 24:15.060
But I'd love to find a way.

24:15.162 --> 24:17.129
To get you more involved
in the business,

24:17.164 --> 24:18.608
In... in what we're doing.
You don't believe.

24:18.632 --> 24:20.165
That there's nothing to be done.

24:23.804 --> 24:25.370
Look at this.

24:27.541 --> 24:29.141
Did you see?

24:29.243 --> 24:30.375
Did you see what was left...

24:30.444 --> 24:32.511
I didn't need to...
Of that fire?

24:32.579 --> 24:34.746
I don't need to see it.
I don't want to see it.

24:34.815 --> 24:37.983
Look. That... it's
happened before.

24:38.085 --> 24:39.384
That's happened.

24:39.453 --> 24:41.019
How... how...
How many times did it...

24:41.121 --> 24:42.888
I don't know. A lot.
Did... how many died?

24:42.956 --> 24:44.789
A whole lot, jeanette. A lot.

24:44.892 --> 24:47.993
Since I was a boy.

24:48.061 --> 24:51.997
It's always been
business as usual.

24:53.567 --> 24:55.867
I should have been
running this farm.

24:59.006 --> 25:01.673
Do you think maybe if you
got yourself cleaned up,

25:01.708 --> 25:03.642
Laurie ann could trust you more?
What does...

25:03.710 --> 25:05.355
What does that have anything
to do with it?

25:05.379 --> 25:08.313
Well, I know about... Addiction,

25:08.415 --> 25:12.117
And I-i know what it looks like,

25:12.219 --> 25:14.586
And I know
what it does to people.

25:24.431 --> 25:26.198
I want to help.

25:31.071 --> 25:33.371
Let me help.

26:00.893 --> 26:01.959
Hey.

26:21.513 --> 26:23.847
Hide it.

26:23.916 --> 26:25.649
Hide it good.

26:58.884 --> 27:01.818
Bueno.

27:04.757 --> 27:05.822
Sƒ­, me gusta.

27:22.641 --> 27:24.374

27:29.982 --> 27:31.748

31:02.161 --> 31:03.861

31:14.373 --> 31:15.806

31:15.875 --> 31:18.275

33:43.022 --> 33:44.621
Su hijo la hac­a sonre­r.

33:49.261 --> 33:51.562

33:55.468 --> 33:58.635
Se molest³ el jefe,

34:27.800 --> 34:29.266
El motel verde.

34:33.205 --> 34:35.050
Los jefes piensan que pueden
hacer lo que quieren.

34:35.074 --> 34:36.540
Con las mujeres.

34:47.887 --> 34:49.786
A nadie le importa.

36:09.201 --> 36:10.467
Yeah?

36:10.569 --> 36:12.636
What did I tell you
about this one?

36:12.705 --> 36:14.416
You two are always messing
around, and look at that.

36:14.440 --> 36:18.208
What? I mean, it...
It's... it's full.

36:18.310 --> 36:21.278
That's full?

36:21.380 --> 36:24.715
That's full to you?

36:24.817 --> 36:27.217
The abuelitas
pick faster than you.

36:27.319 --> 36:28.552
I'm trying.

36:28.654 --> 36:29.953
You're trying?
He... he's been...

36:30.055 --> 36:31.121
Hey.

36:35.628 --> 36:37.227
Let's see you try.

36:37.329 --> 36:38.895
Come on. Let's see you try.

36:38.998 --> 36:42.466
Whoa. You want to pick up
after your bitch now, too?

36:42.568 --> 36:44.701
Let him do it, okay?

36:55.981 --> 36:57.414
Do it again.

36:57.516 --> 36:59.316
Come on.

36:59.351 --> 37:00.951
Got to learn to pick, okay?

37:01.053 --> 37:03.453
It's your fault
he doesn't know how to work.

37:10.129 --> 37:12.896
Do it again.

37:12.965 --> 37:14.798
No.

37:14.900 --> 37:16.400
What?

37:16.502 --> 37:18.735
I'm not doing this.

37:18.837 --> 37:20.357
You want to kick it over,
kick it over.

37:20.406 --> 37:22.172
I'm not... I'm not doing this.

37:22.274 --> 37:24.074
Hey, hey, hey.

37:29.248 --> 37:30.647
Your fault.

37:30.749 --> 37:31.848
You see this?

37:31.950 --> 37:34.718
Why you let him do it?!

37:42.394 --> 37:44.961
You can't even stand up to him.

37:45.030 --> 37:47.864
Do something.

37:47.933 --> 37:49.966
Do something!

37:53.005 --> 37:55.238
You're a... Man.

37:55.307 --> 37:57.307
You know, I try.

37:57.409 --> 38:02.112
I try, and you don't do...

38:02.181 --> 38:04.881
You just let it happen.

38:06.785 --> 38:08.652
You take it, man.

38:08.721 --> 38:10.420
You take it. It's yours.
You take it.

40:17.182 --> 40:18.515
If I told you the stories.

40:18.584 --> 40:21.952
Of lo que pasa in those fields,

40:22.020 --> 40:24.487
You'd say
that we're making it up...

40:24.590 --> 40:27.390
That it doesn't happen...

40:27.492 --> 40:30.160
That it can't happen here.

40:30.229 --> 40:32.662
Another country,
some other city...

40:32.764 --> 40:34.331
But not here.

40:36.134 --> 40:39.970
What we're telling you
is la verdad.

40:40.072 --> 40:41.304
The food on your table.

40:41.406 --> 40:43.473
Comes with a price
that you can't see...

40:46.545 --> 40:49.679
But that somebody has to pay.

40:49.781 --> 40:53.183
Same with the clothes
on your back.

40:53.285 --> 40:55.018
Same with the things
in your house.

40:57.623 --> 40:59.422
You have to look at your life
and ask,

40:59.558 --> 41:02.525
"what does it cost
to live the way I do?

41:02.628 --> 41:04.027
Can I afford it?"

41:04.129 --> 41:05.829
Because other people can't.

41:05.931 --> 41:08.632
Now, you can choose
to ignore it if you want.
