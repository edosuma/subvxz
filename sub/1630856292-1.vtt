My dad changed his last
name to Von Erich,

25:51.832 --> 25:54.464
which was my grandma's
last name.

25:54.566 --> 25:58.708
And I don't know,
I guess her family
had all sorts of tragedy.

25:59.343 --> 26:00.873
So, when my brother died,

26:00.976 --> 26:04.681
people started saying that
it was this curse.

26:05.748 --> 26:07.784
But I don't believe
in any of that.

26:08.387 --> 26:10.985
I know it was all
just bad luck.

26:11.087 --> 26:17.294
Well, I don't believe in curses,
and I don't believe in luck.

26:17.396 --> 26:19.762
I think we make
our own luck.

26:21.859 --> 26:23.194
You're lucky then.

26:37.512 --> 26:40.076
- Kev.
- Hey, Pop.

26:40.178 --> 26:44.116
Get in here.
Come in, son. Sit down.

26:45.090 --> 26:46.991
(CHUCKLES)

26:47.093 --> 26:49.626
Big news for you.

26:49.728 --> 26:53.191
I booked Harley Race
to come to the Sportatorium.

26:53.293 --> 26:56.898
You are gonna fight
the World Heavyweight Champion.

26:57.533 --> 26:59.234
- No way.
- (CHUCKLES)

26:59.336 --> 27:00.970
You kidding me, Pop?

27:01.706 --> 27:03.801
Your first match will be
a non-title fight,

27:03.903 --> 27:08.577
but if you put a whooping on him
and show the world who you are
and what you can do,

27:08.679 --> 27:10.408
you will become
the number one contender

27:10.510 --> 27:14.784
for the World
Heavyweight Championship
and get your title shot.

27:15.583 --> 27:17.118
Pop, thank you.

27:17.921 --> 27:20.857
Thank you.
I... I will make you so
proud.

27:20.959 --> 27:24.321
I've dreamed of having that belt
in this house my whole career

27:25.390 --> 27:29.231
but the NWA never gave me
the chance I deserved.

27:29.333 --> 27:33.932
I got close many times,
but they always robbed me
at the last minute.

27:34.034 --> 27:36.804
So you have to take
this opportunity.

27:36.906 --> 27:39.402
You can be the one
to bring it home for us.

27:41.673 --> 27:43.912
Yes, sir.

27:44.014 --> 27:47.883
HARLEY: I am the four-time
World Heavyweight Champion.

27:47.985 --> 27:54.157
Me, Harley Race,
the real
World Heavyweight Champion.

27:54.259 --> 28:00.794
Not any of this plastic nonsense
that you all parade around with
out there.

28:00.896 --> 28:04.095
You have all these guys
walking around

28:04.197 --> 28:08.967
talking loud about
how they are the man.

28:09.069 --> 28:14.844
Ric Flair, Dusty Rhodes,
Tommy Rich,

28:15.813 --> 28:18.980
or one of your snot-nosed
Von Erich kids.

28:20.316 --> 28:22.719
Well,

28:22.821 --> 28:28.055
this belt is the only measure
of who is the man.

28:28.689 --> 28:31.421
And that man is me.

28:31.523 --> 28:37.630
The World's
Heavyweight Champion,
Harley Race.

29:07.061 --> 29:08.663
Good evening,

29:08.765 --> 29:10.998

to an exciting night

29:11.100 --> 29:14.033
of World Class

29:14.135 --> 29:17.907
Tonight we have
a momentous main event,

29:18.009 --> 29:21.238
NWA World Heavyweight Champ
Harley Race is in town

29:21.340 --> 29:25.414
to take on Texas Champion,
Kevin Von Erich.

29:25.516 --> 29:28.214

29:34.658 --> 29:35.755

29:35.857 --> 29:37.389
You can feel the excitement here

29:37.491 --> 29:40.528
at the world famous Sportatorium
in downtown Dallas, Texas.

29:40.630 --> 29:42.296
As that man right there,

29:42.398 --> 29:46.199
local hero Kevin Von Erich
faces his biggest challenge
to date.

29:46.301 --> 29:52.038
Four-time World Champion,
the indomitable Harley Race.

29:52.141 --> 29:55.077
What an occasion this is
for Von Erich family.

29:55.179 --> 29:58.476
The 3,500 fans in the building
and everyone watching at home

29:58.578 --> 30:02.716
as we are broadcasting
in 62 countries
around the world.

30:02.818 --> 30:04.954
All eyes are on this contest.

30:06.151 --> 30:07.988
Now this is a non-title fight.

30:08.090 --> 30:09.957
The belt cannot change hands
here, tonight.

30:10.060 --> 30:12.555
But it is a tremendous
opportunity for Kevin.

30:12.657 --> 30:16.562
If he can win, he would become
the number one contender.

30:16.664 --> 30:17.895
(CROWD CHEERING)

30:17.997 --> 30:19.362

30:19.465 --> 30:22.103
Harley Race overpowering Kevin
into the corner.

30:25.042 --> 30:27.269
And he delivers a big blow
to the mid-section,

30:27.371 --> 30:29.073
knocks the wind
right out of him.

30:29.175 --> 30:30.879
Not a great start
for the young man

30:30.982 --> 30:33.743
looking to make an impression
here tonight.

30:33.845 --> 30:38.188
And a devastating shot
to the lower back
puts Kevin on the mat.

30:38.290 --> 30:41.787
He's lining up a big shot
and Kevin blocks it
and returns a punch.

30:41.889 --> 30:43.993
Connects once. Twice.

30:45.462 --> 30:46.356
And three times.

30:46.459 --> 30:49.066
Hits Harley Race again
pretty hard on that one.

with a clothesline.

30:52.471 --> 30:54.135
The champ doesn't budge.

30:54.237 --> 30:56.432
Kevin again off the ropes.
Oh, and he knocks him down.

30:56.534 --> 30:59.137
He knocks down the old oak tree,
Harley Race,

30:59.239 --> 31:01.977
with a spectacular
flying clothesline.

31:02.079 --> 31:04.274
But the champ is right back up.
Shaking it off.

31:04.376 --> 31:06.210
Kevin goes straight
into a bear hug.

belly-to-back suplex.

31:12.152 --> 31:13.951
Oh, I don't think
the Ref saw that.

31:14.053 --> 31:15.622
Kevin's struggling now.

31:15.724 --> 31:20.430
A vicious tactic from Race
who looks to get back on top
in this contest.

Let's go for a ride, kid.

31:23.564 --> 31:26.597

he tosses Kevin
over the top rope.

31:26.699 --> 31:30.534
My goodness.
Kevin crashes down
on that concrete floor.

31:32.407 --> 31:36.208
Race, absolutely ruthless,
gets Kevin in a suplex.

31:36.310 --> 31:38.615
Oh, no. I hope he doesn't do it.
And he does!

31:38.717 --> 31:41.249
Harley Race puts
a standing suplex

31:41.351 --> 31:43.748
on Kevin Von Erich,

He's seen it all. He's--
Well, he's self-sacrificed.

on his back.

- Yep.

42:09.779 --> 42:12.407

Hey, what do you play?

42:23.325 --> 42:29.665
Lots of things.
Um... viola, violin, piano,
some other instruments.

your father,

42:38.840 --> 42:41.006
he was classically trained
on the clarinet

42:41.108 --> 42:43.773

42:47.478 --> 42:48.516
Wow.

42:48.618 --> 42:50.747

no future in music.

42:50.849 --> 42:53.417
I chose sport and I was right.

42:53.519 --> 43:00.058
He used to play
the most beautiful pieces for me
when we first dated.

43:01.296 --> 43:02.263
DAVID: Aww.

43:02.365 --> 43:04.728
Such a well-rounded man.

43:04.830 --> 43:06.097
