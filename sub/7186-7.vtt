<i>¶ Just off the shores</i>

00:09.510 --> 00:10.642
<i>¶ A hideaway at sea </i>

00:10.644 --> 00:11.810
- Yo-ho!
- Yo-ho!

00:11.812 --> 00:14.246
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

00:14.248 --> 00:15.614
<i>¶ A pirate band</i>

00:15.616 --> 00:16.749

<i>We need some volunteers ¶</i>

00:32.666 --> 00:34.533

<i>- Ahoy!</i>

00:34.535 --> 00:35.768

<i>- Ahoy!</i>

00:35.770 --> 00:37.569

00:46.313 --> 00:48.714
<i>¶ Climb aboard, me hearties</i>

00:48.716 --> 00:50.282
Let's go!

00:50.284 --> 00:52.284
¶ With Jake
and the Never Land Pirates ¶

00:52.286 --> 00:54.620
<i>¶ We'll set the course</i>

00:54.622 --> 00:55.754

00:56.723 --> 00:58.624
Yo-ho, let's go!

00:58.626 --> 01:00.626
Ha-har!

01:01.394 --> 01:02.828
Ahoy, mateys!

01:02.830 --> 01:05.697
Do you want to join
my pirate crew?

01:06.800 --> 01:07.833
Great!

01:07.835 --> 01:09.701
To start today's adventure,

01:09.703 --> 01:12.604
everybody say
the Pirate Password.

01:12.606 --> 01:13.872
Yo-ho-ho!

01:13.874 --> 01:15.874
[all] Yo-ho-ho!

01:15.876 --> 01:17.709
One more time.

01:17.711 --> 01:19.778
[all] Yo-ho-ho!

01:23.316 --> 01:25.717
<i>[Jake]</i> Captain Hook's Lagoon.

01:25.719 --> 01:27.786
[Hook] Step lively, Mr. Smee!

01:27.788 --> 01:30.756
I, Captain Hook,
am about to find

01:30.758 --> 01:35.828
the legendary treasure
of the Golden Oldie Pirates!

01:35.830 --> 01:38.797
Ahoy, Captain Hook!
Look what we found.

01:38.799 --> 01:41.366
Blasted puny pirates!

01:41.368 --> 01:46.705
A mountain of emeralds
awaits us on Gemstone Island!

01:46.707 --> 01:48.941
[bell clanging]

01:50.376 --> 01:52.878
- Hi, Captain Hook!
- [Hook] Blast!

01:52.880 --> 01:56.882
Those scurvy swabs have
beaten me once again!

01:58.751 --> 02:01.753
Oh, I'm done, Mr. Smee.

02:01.755 --> 02:05.924
Look at me. A once
glorious pirate captain

02:05.926 --> 02:10.696
bested by a pack
of puny pirates.

02:10.698 --> 02:12.664
There, there, cap'n.

02:12.666 --> 02:16.635
What you need is to get back
your old energy and pizzazz.

02:16.637 --> 02:18.403
You need to have fun!

02:18.405 --> 02:20.639
Ah, maybe you're right.

02:20.641 --> 02:22.741
It would be refreshing
to go to a place

02:22.743 --> 02:26.812
where there are no problems,
and no puny pirates!

02:26.814 --> 02:32.784
I think I know just the spot
where you can play all day long.

02:34.721 --> 02:37.890
[Hook] Pirates' Plunge!
It's perfect!

02:37.892 --> 02:40.392
Let's get going, boys.

02:40.394 --> 02:43.762
Last one in's
a rotten crocodile's egg!

02:43.764 --> 02:47.666
Uh, beg pardon, cap'n,
but, uh, I'm afraid

02:47.668 --> 02:50.435
- we've got company.
- What?

02:50.437 --> 02:51.937
[all laughing]

02:51.939 --> 02:55.841
Awesome! Pirates' Plunge rules!

02:55.843 --> 03:00.812
Blast! Is there no escape
from those tiny tormenters?

03:00.814 --> 03:03.782
Uh, perhaps we can find
another place, cap'n,

03:03.784 --> 03:05.951
far away from the sea pups.

03:05.953 --> 03:11.023
I've got a better idea.
I'll make me own lagoon!

03:12.992 --> 03:15.761
Yee-haw!

03:15.763 --> 03:18.897
Way-hey, outta my way!

03:20.900 --> 03:23.835
Whoo-hoo! Look out below!

03:25.438 --> 03:27.773
Huh? What's going on?

03:27.775 --> 03:30.709
- [Cubby] My turn!
- [Izzy] No, Cubby. Don't!

03:30.711 --> 03:33.946
- The water's disappearing.
- Ah, coconuts!

03:33.948 --> 03:37.916
The stream that brings water
to the plunge is dry, too!

03:37.918 --> 03:40.886
I bet something's stopping
the water from getting here.

03:40.888 --> 03:43.822
But this is our
favorite place to swim.

03:43.824 --> 03:45.924
Say, mateys,
will you help us find out

03:45.926 --> 03:47.993
what happened to all the water?

03:49.762 --> 03:52.798
Great! Let's all keep a
look out for gold doubloons.

03:52.800 --> 03:56.468
Whenever we solve
a pirate problem together,
they'll appear.

03:56.470 --> 03:59.871
Then we'll collect 'em and put
'em in our Team Treasure Chest.

03:59.873 --> 04:02.007
Is everybody ready?

04:02.009 --> 04:04.910
- I've got my sword.
- I got my map!

04:04.912 --> 04:07.512
And I've got
my pixie dust.

04:07.514 --> 04:10.882
The fairies gave it to me
so that we can use it to fly.

04:10.884 --> 04:12.851
But only in emergencies.

04:12.853 --> 04:17.956
Yo-ho! Let's go find out
why there's no more water
at Pirates' Plunge!

04:20.526 --> 04:23.862
<i>¶ Yo-ho, mateys away </i>

04:23.864 --> 04:26.031
<i>¶ There'll be treasure</i>
<i>and adventure today ¶</i>

04:26.033 --> 04:27.799
<i>¶ Let's go </i>

04:27.801 --> 04:31.003
<i>¶ Heave ho, here we go</i>
<i>Together as a team ¶</i>

04:31.005 --> 04:34.039
<i>¶ Jake and the</i>
<i>Never Land Pirates ¶</i>

04:34.041 --> 04:36.008
<i>¶ And me </i>

04:40.913 --> 04:45.517
¶ Now we're set adrift and
singin' in a pirate paradise ¶

04:45.519 --> 04:48.053
<i>¶ Our floatin' floaties</i>
<i>floatin' us along ¶</i>

04:49.822 --> 04:51.890
<i>¶ We're lazy afternoonin' </i>

04:51.892 --> 04:53.959
<i>¶ On a cool and cozy ride </i>

04:53.961 --> 04:58.030
<i>¶ So strum a tune of</i>
<i>Hook's Lagoon, says I ¶</i>

04:58.032 --> 05:03.869
<i>¶ Cause we're floatin'</i>
<i>in a pirate paradise ¶</i>

05:04.904 --> 05:08.573
Oh, Smee!
This is so much fun!

05:08.575 --> 05:11.109
I feel like a
new pirate already.

05:11.111 --> 05:16.815
Why, I think I'll name
this place Hook's Lagoon!

05:16.817 --> 05:18.050
Catchy name, cap'n.

05:18.052 --> 05:20.585
But I'm not sure that
piling up the rocks

05:20.587 --> 05:23.989
and making this huge pool
was such a good idea.

05:23.991 --> 05:26.858
And why not, pray tell?

05:26.860 --> 05:29.928
Because the water isn't
going where it should.

05:29.930 --> 05:31.863
Into Pirates' Plunge.

05:31.865 --> 05:34.566
[chuckling] Smee,
whenever will you learn?

05:34.568 --> 05:39.571
What's good for Captain Hook
is good for Captain Hook!

05:39.573 --> 05:42.607
Hey, all this stuff
wasn't here before!

05:42.609 --> 05:44.576
That's got to be why
Pirates' Plunge

05:44.578 --> 05:46.611
is as dry as a
stale cracker!

05:46.613 --> 05:49.948
Come on! Let's check out
what's on the other side.

05:51.084 --> 05:54.886
Yay-hey, no way!
Hook took all the water.

05:54.888 --> 05:56.955
How are we gonna get it back?

05:56.957 --> 05:59.624
Leave it to me, Izzy.
Captain Hook!

05:59.626 --> 06:02.227
You took all our water
from Pirates' Plunge.

06:02.229 --> 06:04.129
Blast!

06:04.131 --> 06:06.865
What are you
pocket-sized pests

06:06.867 --> 06:09.067
doing in my
private paradise?

06:09.069 --> 06:11.636
You're ruining my fun!

06:11.638 --> 06:14.139
Boys, let's make some waves

06:14.141 --> 06:17.876
and wash those
scurvy swabs away!

06:17.878 --> 06:21.146
Whoa, oh, oh!
This be kind of fun!

06:21.148 --> 06:25.951
[laughing] Oh, bouncy fun!

06:25.953 --> 06:28.019
- Whoa!
- Shiver me timbers!

06:28.021 --> 06:30.088
- Ah, coconuts!
- Cracked crackers!

06:30.090 --> 06:34.926
Excellent! Now I can
go back to having my fun.

06:34.928 --> 06:36.928
Continue, Smee!

06:36.930 --> 06:39.998
Continuing, cap'n.
[panting]

06:40.000 --> 06:43.135
We can't let old Feather Hat
get away with this!

06:43.137 --> 06:45.904
But how can we
get over to him?

06:45.906 --> 06:49.107
- Let's make a boat!
- This log might work.

06:49.109 --> 06:52.944
Way-hey!
This makes a great canoe.

06:52.946 --> 06:56.081
Way to go! We're paddling
across the water,

06:56.083 --> 06:58.917
and we got
three gold doubloons!

06:58.919 --> 07:01.286
Let grab them
and go talk to Hook.

07:02.121 --> 07:04.222
Ahoy, Captain Hook!

07:04.224 --> 07:09.661
You again? Why can't you
simply leave me alone?

07:09.663 --> 07:12.931
Because you took all the
water from Pirates' Plunge.

07:12.933 --> 07:15.000
We can't swim
there anymore.

07:15.002 --> 07:17.669
So could you please
tear down your wall?

07:17.671 --> 07:21.173
Then we can get our
water back and have fun!

07:21.175 --> 07:25.110
[groaning] But then
my fun would be ruined!

07:25.112 --> 07:27.679
So go away!

07:27.681 --> 07:33.084
Or as me windmill-hook
might say... blow away!

07:33.086 --> 07:35.220
- Yo-ho, oh no!
- Coconuts!

07:35.222 --> 07:39.157
Whoa! Oh! Rock and roll!

07:39.159 --> 07:41.259
Thar she flows.

07:41.261 --> 07:42.961
That's it!

07:42.963 --> 07:46.031
Maybe we can take down
the wall one rock at a time.

07:48.034 --> 07:52.137
- Yay-hey! It's working!
- We got some water to flow

07:52.139 --> 07:54.739
and we got three more
gold doubloons.

07:54.741 --> 07:58.310
Let's grab them and
go move more rocks
to save Pirates' Plunge.

07:59.111 --> 08:00.812
Barnacles!

08:00.814 --> 08:04.216
Those puny pirates are
out to ruin my lagoon!

08:04.218 --> 08:07.185
Like you ruined
Pirates' Plunge, sir?

08:07.187 --> 08:11.056
Stow it, Smee. Forward, men!

08:11.058 --> 08:12.257
Aye, cap'n.

08:12.259 --> 08:16.127
Put a stop to those
scurvy small fries!

08:18.297 --> 08:21.166
Uh-oh! Here comes Hook!

08:21.168 --> 08:25.136
Well, Hook can't stop us
if he can't catch us.

08:25.138 --> 08:29.007
That's what you think,
puny pirates.

08:30.076 --> 08:32.777
A-ha! They've stopped.

08:32.779 --> 08:35.080
Full speed ahead, men.

08:36.282 --> 08:38.283
Now mateys, row!

08:38.285 --> 08:41.152
[all shouting]

08:45.224 --> 08:49.227
Blast your youth
and enthusiasm!

08:49.229 --> 08:54.099
Why won't you just go away
and let me enjoy my lagoon?

08:54.101 --> 08:57.302
Sorry Hook, but
we're not going anywhere!

08:57.304 --> 09:01.840
Not until we get the water
back to Pirates' Plunge!

09:01.842 --> 09:07.045
Never!
The water stays. You go.

09:07.047 --> 09:11.783
Smee! Let's have some speed
this time! Pedal fast!

09:11.785 --> 09:15.053
[grunting] Pedaling, sir!

09:15.055 --> 09:18.256
You call this fast? Faster!

09:18.258 --> 09:21.793
[panting] Fast,
faster, fastest, sir!

09:21.795 --> 09:23.295
That's more like it.

09:23.297 --> 09:26.298
Here he comes.
Let's move out of the way.

09:26.300 --> 09:30.302
[grunts] Blast!
Smee, turn around.

09:30.304 --> 09:33.371
I can't!
We're going too fast!

09:34.807 --> 09:37.275
[screams]
Buckets of bilge water!

09:37.277 --> 09:40.111
- Whoa!
- Oh, my!

09:40.113 --> 09:44.082
Smee, look what
you've done!

09:44.084 --> 09:47.385
I'm sorry, cap'n.
Maybe I can fix it.

09:47.387 --> 09:49.254
- Or not.
- Blast!

09:49.256 --> 09:52.090
[both screaming]

09:52.092 --> 09:55.126
Crackers! We're gonna
go over the falls.

09:55.128 --> 09:57.195
Izzy,
this is an emergency!

09:57.197 --> 10:01.399
Then it's time for...
pixie dust away!

10:05.171 --> 10:08.873
Way to go!
We used pixie dust
to fly to safety

10:08.875 --> 10:11.843
and we got three more
gold doubloons!

10:11.845 --> 10:15.246
Let's grab them and go
back to Pirates' Plunge!

10:18.884 --> 10:24.322
Yo-ho, way to go!
We saved Pirates' Plunge!

10:24.324 --> 10:27.892
Sharky! Bones!
How's it going, boys?

10:27.894 --> 10:32.130
Whoo-hoo! Best vacation ever!

10:32.132 --> 10:33.898
[laughing]

10:33.900 --> 10:36.368
[whooping]

10:36.370 --> 10:38.269
Shiver me timbers!

10:38.271 --> 10:41.139
Pirates' Plunge is
cooler than ever.

10:41.141 --> 10:42.907
And wetter!

10:42.909 --> 10:45.377
Finally, I get my turn!

10:45.379 --> 10:49.180
Coconuts!

10:49.182 --> 10:52.317
Smee! Get me
down from here.

10:52.319 --> 10:55.420
Pedaling, sir.
[grunting]

10:57.356 --> 11:00.425
Thanks for helping us save
Pirates' Plunge, mateys.

11:00.427 --> 11:02.527
Now, let's put all
our gold doubloons

11:02.529 --> 11:05.196
into our
Team Treasure Chest.

11:12.271 --> 11:14.372
<i>¶ Way, hey</i>
<i>Well done, crew ¶</i>

11:14.374 --> 11:16.408
<i>¶ Everyone knew</i>
<i>just what to do ¶</i>

11:16.410 --> 11:18.410
<i>¶ Way, hey</i>
<i>With help from you ¶</i>

11:18.412 --> 11:21.379
<i>¶ It's time to count</i>
<i>our gold doubloons! ¶</i>

11:21.381 --> 11:24.249
Come on. Count with us.

11:25.184 --> 11:26.451
[all] Yeah!

11:27.920 --> 11:30.422
[Izzy] One, two, three...

11:30.424 --> 11:32.490
[Cubby] Four, five, six...

11:32.492 --> 11:35.427
[Jake] Seven, eight, nine!

11:35.429 --> 11:38.963
Yo, ho! For solving
pirate problems today,

11:38.965 --> 11:42.367
we got nine gold doubloons.

11:42.369 --> 11:45.303
Thanks for helping us
save Pirates' Plunge.

11:45.305 --> 11:49.374
Now we can go back there
and swim anytime we want.

11:51.510 --> 11:53.344
Ah, Smee,

11:53.346 --> 11:58.516
this Never Sea floatie is so
comfy I'm finally relaxed.

11:58.518 --> 12:03.421
[stammering] But, cap'n, we
haven't got a Never Sea floatie.

12:03.423 --> 12:06.491
Then what am I floating on?

12:06.493 --> 12:11.463
[screams]
Smee! Save me!

12:16.268 --> 12:18.970
<i>[Jake]</i> Undersea Bucky!

12:18.972 --> 12:22.273
[all] Yo-ho!

12:22.275 --> 12:25.276
Pirate tubing,
what a blast!

12:25.278 --> 12:27.412
Hang on, mateys. Wave ho!

12:27.414 --> 12:29.447
[whooping]

12:29.449 --> 12:33.318
Crackers! We're the fastest
thing on the Never Sea!

12:33.320 --> 12:37.021
What? Correction:
we were the fastest!

12:37.023 --> 12:40.892
Yo-ho, Marina!
What's the hurry?

12:40.894 --> 12:42.460
Ahoy, pirate friends.

12:42.462 --> 12:44.929
These dolphins brought me
an urgent message

12:44.931 --> 12:46.264
from Neptune City.

12:46.266 --> 12:48.466
- The mermaid city?
- Aye.

12:48.468 --> 12:52.337
The pink pearl, which
lights up the great city,
has stopped working!

12:52.339 --> 12:54.372
The city's gone dark.

12:54.374 --> 12:57.408
Ah, coconuts.
That's bad news!

12:57.410 --> 13:00.311
I've got to get the
pink pearl working again!

13:00.313 --> 13:02.380
The mermaids
are leaving the city,

13:02.382 --> 13:04.916
and won't return
until the power is back.

13:04.918 --> 13:08.319
That sounds like a big job,
Marina. We'll help you!

13:08.321 --> 13:09.454
Thank you, everybody!

13:09.456 --> 13:11.489
Mateys! Will you come with us

13:11.491 --> 13:15.360
to help restore the pink pearl's
power to Neptune City?

13:16.462 --> 13:20.064
Great! Remember to keep a
look out for gold doubloons.

13:20.066 --> 13:23.935
Whenever we solve a
pirate problem together,
they'll appear.

13:23.937 --> 13:27.405
Then we'll collect 'em and put
'em in our Team Treasure Chest.

13:27.407 --> 13:30.041
Yo-ho, let's go!

13:32.511 --> 13:35.413
<i>¶ Yo-ho, mateys away </i>

13:35.415 --> 13:38.082
<i>¶ There'll be treasure</i>
<i>and adventure today ¶</i>

13:38.084 --> 13:42.487
<i>¶ Heave ho, here we go</i>
<i>Together as a team ¶</i>

13:42.489 --> 13:45.990
<i>¶ Jake and the</i>
<i>Never Land Pirates ¶</i>

13:45.992 --> 13:47.559
<i>¶ And me </i>

13:50.429 --> 13:52.530
[Cubby] Where are we, Marina?

13:52.532 --> 13:56.000
Those three rocks mark the
location of Neptune City.

13:56.002 --> 13:59.504
[Jake] Gosh, Marina, I don't see
a city on any of those rocks.

13:59.506 --> 14:03.541
It's underwater. Those rocks
are the top of a giant statue

14:03.543 --> 14:05.543
in the center of Neptune City.

14:05.545 --> 14:10.014
Look! Mermaids...
Swimming away from the city.

14:10.016 --> 14:13.418
They're all leaving.
There's no time to lose!

14:13.420 --> 14:15.453
Below the waves we go.

14:15.455 --> 14:18.523
Wait, Marina!
We're not mer-kids
like you.

14:18.525 --> 14:20.592
We can't breathe underwater!

14:22.461 --> 14:24.596
Sounds like Bucky has an idea.

14:27.399 --> 14:29.601
[all] Shiver me timbers!

14:38.577 --> 14:41.412
It's Submarine Bucky!

14:41.414 --> 14:44.082
[chuckles] Bucky's
full of surprises.

14:44.084 --> 14:48.519
He is an amazing ship.
Follow me, friends.

14:49.154 --> 14:52.490
[all] Dive! Dive! Dive!

14:52.492 --> 14:54.525
[Bones] Cap'n,
lookee over there.

14:54.527 --> 14:57.528
The popinjay's ship,
it's sinking!

14:57.530 --> 15:00.431
Barnacles!
It's not sinking.

15:00.433 --> 15:04.402
It's a special underwater
boat-contraption.

15:04.404 --> 15:07.438
No doubt used to hunt
for sunken treasure.

15:07.440 --> 15:10.174
- Follow them, men!
- But, Captain Hook, sir,

15:10.176 --> 15:13.444
I thought we were looking for
the <i>Jolly Roger's</i> lost anchor.

15:13.446 --> 15:15.580
- We still haven't...
- New mission, Smee.

15:15.582 --> 15:18.549
- Follow those puny pirates!
- Sir?

15:18.551 --> 15:22.487
The    <i>Jolly Rog</i>can't turn into
an underwater boat-contraption.

15:22.489 --> 15:25.590
There are other ways
to follow them, Smee!

15:25.592 --> 15:27.625
Oh, goody.

15:30.429 --> 15:32.530
[Marina] This way, friends.

15:32.532 --> 15:35.433
[Skully] That's one big statue!

15:35.435 --> 15:38.202
[Jake] That's Neptune,
ancient king of the seas.

15:38.204 --> 15:41.172
The mermaids named
Neptune City after him.

15:42.441 --> 15:46.077
[stuttering] Shark!

15:46.079 --> 15:49.447
- [all gasping]
- [Skully] Look at all
those pointy teeth!

15:50.516 --> 15:53.484
- [all] Whoa!
- Oh, seaweed!

15:53.486 --> 15:55.486
He thinks Bucky's
another big shark

15:55.488 --> 15:59.157
- moving in on his territory!
- We gotta hide Bucky.

16:00.659 --> 16:03.561
- There's nowhere to hide.
- Look!

16:03.563 --> 16:07.465
[Cubby] The statues head
is hollow like a cave!

16:07.467 --> 16:11.469
Good eye, Cubby.
Bucky, head inside that head!

16:16.141 --> 16:19.110
[all growling]

16:19.112 --> 16:21.212
[Jake whispering]
Yo-ho. We did it!

16:21.214 --> 16:25.183
We lost the shark!
And we got two gold doubloons.

16:25.185 --> 16:27.652
Let's grab them and go deeper.

16:31.190 --> 16:34.659
I want whatever treasure
those popinjays are after.

16:34.661 --> 16:39.597
Um, cap'n? You might
want to look over that-a way.

16:39.599 --> 16:42.166
Sloshing chum buckets!

16:42.168 --> 16:45.203
Keep pumping, Bones!
The cap'n and Mr. Smee

16:45.205 --> 16:48.272
need plenty of air to breathe
down below them waves.

16:48.274 --> 16:51.242
[Hook and Smee screaming]

16:51.244 --> 16:54.746
You silly gooses!
There's no shark up there!

16:57.182 --> 17:00.551
That hand normally holds a
giant shell and the pink pearl!

17:00.553 --> 17:03.721
- They're missing!
- Where do you think they went?

17:03.723 --> 17:06.157
Maybe it fell
to the sea floor.

17:06.159 --> 17:07.225
Good thinking, Izzy!

17:11.230 --> 17:15.600
[Skully] Crackers!
That is one giant clam shell.

17:15.602 --> 17:17.702
It's the shell from
Neptune's hand!

17:17.704 --> 17:19.303
Something knocked it off.

17:19.305 --> 17:23.274
It must have drifted down
and landed here.

17:23.276 --> 17:27.278
Look! A pale pink glow
coming from beneath the shell.

17:27.280 --> 17:29.580
The pink pearl must be
trapped under there!

17:29.582 --> 17:32.650
That shell is what plunged
our city into darkness!

17:32.652 --> 17:35.253
Friends, we've got to get
the magical pink pearl...

17:35.255 --> 17:39.257
- [all] Captain Hook?
- A magical pearl, eh?

17:39.259 --> 17:41.325
Sounds like treasure!

17:41.327 --> 17:43.728
Treasure that doesn't
belong to you, Hook.

17:43.730 --> 17:47.298
We can't uncover it with
Hook standing on that shell!

17:47.300 --> 17:49.600
Bucky, can you
help us out?

17:53.572 --> 17:56.340
Quickly, Smee,
help me move this shell.

17:56.342 --> 18:00.678
- Put me down this instant!
- [Smee laughs] It tickles!

18:02.714 --> 18:04.749
- What in...
- Hang on, cap'n!

18:04.751 --> 18:07.718
We did it! We got rid of Hook.

18:07.720 --> 18:10.588
And we got two more
gold doubloons.

18:10.590 --> 18:13.791
Let's grab them
and go help Marina!

18:13.793 --> 18:17.261
How are we ever going
to lift this huge shell?

18:17.263 --> 18:20.364
It's as big as Bucky!
Even he can't lift it.

18:20.366 --> 18:23.768
I have an idea. Maybe some
of your friends can help?

18:23.770 --> 18:26.370
[gasping]
I bet they can!

18:26.372 --> 18:29.874
Friends of the deep,
whirl and swirl.

18:35.614 --> 18:38.683
- [Jake] Wow.
- [Cubby] Coconuts.

18:38.685 --> 18:41.853
[Izzy] It's beautiful.

18:48.694 --> 18:52.396
[gasps] Scaly tails!
What's this?

18:52.398 --> 18:57.335
[gasps] The anchor from
Captain Hook's <i>Jolly Roger</i>
<i>was inside the shell.</i>

18:57.337 --> 18:59.770
Hook's anchor must have hooked
the shell and pulled it,

18:59.772 --> 19:02.773
and the pink pearl,
out of Neptune's hand!

19:02.775 --> 19:05.643
Quickly, Smee!
Grab the pink pearl.

19:05.645 --> 19:08.412
It's time we take it
as our own!

19:08.414 --> 19:11.749
Oh, lookee, Captain!
Anchor ahoy!

19:11.751 --> 19:14.785
We found the treasure
and our missing anchor!

19:14.787 --> 19:17.321
That's two missions
accomplished.

19:17.323 --> 19:21.826
Enough chitter-chatter, Smee!
Help me lift this magical pearl.

19:21.828 --> 19:24.695
Uh-uh! The pink pearl
isn't going anywhere

19:24.697 --> 19:26.697
but back to Neptune's hand!

19:26.699 --> 19:29.800
Oh, really? And who's
going to stop me?

19:29.802 --> 19:31.836
[Jake] We are, Captain Hook!

19:31.838 --> 19:34.438
With the help of
Submarine Bucky.

19:35.807 --> 19:37.441
[both grunting]

19:39.411 --> 19:43.314
I shall not stop until
the pearl is mine!

19:43.316 --> 19:45.683
Um, cap'n, sir...

19:45.685 --> 19:49.687
[stuttering]
Sha-Sha-Sha-Sha...

19:49.689 --> 19:53.324
Oh. Shark!

19:53.326 --> 19:58.729
- Run, Smee, run!
- Running, sir, running!

19:58.731 --> 20:03.834
[chuckling] I don't think
we'll see old Feather Helmet
back down here anytime soon!

20:04.770 --> 20:08.339
[Jake] There.
Back where it belongs!

20:08.341 --> 20:09.840
- Wow.
- [Skully] Crackers.

20:09.842 --> 20:11.742
- [Cubby] Whoa.
- [Skully] So bright!

20:11.744 --> 20:13.477
[Izzy] Amazing!

20:13.479 --> 20:16.480
The power of the
pink pearl is back!

20:16.482 --> 20:18.416
- All right!
- Hooray!

20:18.418 --> 20:20.484
- Yeah!
- Whoo-hoo!

20:20.486 --> 20:25.489
With Bucky's help,
we restored the power
of the pink pearl

20:25.491 --> 20:29.727
to Neptune City, and we got
four more gold doubloons.

20:29.729 --> 20:32.430
Let's grab them and go!

20:32.432 --> 20:36.500
Look, the mermaids.
They're coming back!

20:36.502 --> 20:40.438
The radiant light
of the pink pearl
is calling them home!

20:44.743 --> 20:47.378
<i>¶ Mermaids hear me</i>
<i>sing to you ¶</i>

20:47.380 --> 20:49.480

Thank you so much,
pirate friends,

21:16.976 --> 21:19.944
- for all your help.
- You're welcome, Marina.

21:19.946 --> 21:22.480
- Anytime!
- It's what we do!

21:22.482 --> 21:25.416
Submarine Bucky,
to Pirate Island!

21:25.418 --> 21:26.851
- Bye, Marina!
- Bye!

21:26.853 --> 21:28.886
- [Cubby] So long!
- [Skully] Catch ya later!

21:39.865 --> 21:42.500
Yo-ho, way to go, mateys!

21:42.502 --> 21:46.437
Thanks for helping return
the power of the pink pearl
to Neptune City!

21:46.439 --> 21:48.539
Now let's put all our
gold doubloons

21:48.541 --> 21:50.908
into our
Team Treasure Chest.

21:57.983 --> 22:00.484

<i>Well done, crew ¶</i>

22:00.486 --> 22:02.553

22:07.493 --> 22:09.860
Come on. Count with us.

22:10.562 --> 22:12.096
[all] Yeah!

22:13.598 --> 22:17.601
[Jake] One, two,
three, four, five,

22:17.603 --> 22:20.571
six, seven, eight.

22:20.573 --> 22:23.541
Yay-hey! For solving
pirate problems today,

22:23.543 --> 22:27.044
we got eight gold doubloons.

22:27.046 --> 22:29.480
[Bucky's bell clanging]

22:29.482 --> 22:31.949
Whoops!
That's right, Bucky!

22:31.951 --> 22:35.052
And we got a cool
new pirate submarine!

22:35.054 --> 22:37.088
[bell clanging]

22:39.624 --> 22:43.861
This boring job is getting even
more boringer by the minute!

22:43.863 --> 22:47.064
Well, you should
pass the time with
fishing, like me.

22:47.066 --> 22:50.034
[grunts] Whoa!
I caught me a big one!

22:50.036 --> 22:52.870
Help me pull it in, mate.

'Tis a whopper! [grunts]

Sharky! Bones!
