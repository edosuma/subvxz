called the Qowat Milat,
or Final Stranglers

41:40.846 --> 41:42.412
as they were known in the North,
and I postulated

41:42.456 --> 41:44.589
it wasn't true,
but I-I didn't have any proof

41:44.632 --> 41:46.721
until I saw that Picard
had apprehended a Romulan.

41:46.765 --> 41:48.070
So, out of an abundance
of caution,

41:48.114 --> 41:49.942
I sent a coded message

41:49.985 --> 41:51.683
to my old drinking pal,
the president,

41:51.726 --> 41:53.772
aka Annika Seven Shot.

41:53.815 --> 41:56.601

That's for another time. Wow.

41:56.644 --> 41:59.212

my hypothesis,

41:59.255 --> 42:00.735

There was a lot of screaming.

Anyway, it-it turns out

42:02.955 --> 42:04.260
the queen was totally lying

42:04.304 --> 42:06.132
in a typical
"weaker-than-thou species

42:06.175 --> 42:07.873

kind of strategy.

42:07.916 --> 42:09.309
And, so, she's off, you know,

42:09.352 --> 42:11.311

or whatever.

42:11.354 --> 42:14.227

42:14.270 --> 42:16.621
As you were.

42:22.540 --> 42:24.150
Madam President,

42:24.193 --> 42:26.413
