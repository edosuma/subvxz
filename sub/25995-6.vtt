00:00.094 --> 00:02.164
Sergeant David Budd,
Metropolitan Police.

00:02.166 --> 00:06.793
British Transport Police have put out
an alert on a possible suicide bomber.

00:06.796 --> 00:09.665
Don't do that! Please don't do that!
Please just stay still.

00:11.945 --> 00:15.063
<font color="lime">You have children?</font> Yes. I do, two.

00:15.065 --> 00:17.063
That's Ella. She's ten.

00:17.065 --> 00:18.903
Charlie. He's eight.

00:18.905 --> 00:21.703
The Government is intent on
forcing through a beefed-up

00:21.705 --> 00:26.063
Regulation of Investigatory Powers
Act, RIPA-18 as it's being dubbed,

00:26.065 --> 00:28.543
spearheaded by you.

00:28.545 --> 00:31.983
Only those intent on acts of
violence have anything to fear.

00:31.985 --> 00:35.503
I want you right beside me,
not because it's your job,

00:35.505 --> 00:36.863
but because it's our choice.

00:36.865 --> 00:40.383
This is a very, very dangerous
politician.

00:40.385 --> 00:42.345
Someone who must be stopped.

00:49.105 --> 00:52.543
Despite the heroic efforts
of our emergency services,

00:52.545 --> 00:57.023
the Home Secretary, Julia Montague,
succumbed to her injuries

00:57.025 --> 00:59.903
and was pronounced dead
a short while ago.

01:02.025 --> 01:03.383
Someone tampered with my gun.

01:03.385 --> 01:04.983
The police searched your flat.

01:04.985 --> 01:07.303
If they found an illegal firearm,
they'd seize it,

01:07.305 --> 01:09.503
they wouldn't just change out
the bullets for blanks.

01:09.505 --> 01:12.703
The PM's asked me to step up
to Acting Home Secretary.

01:12.705 --> 01:15.983
Now, it goes without saying,
I'd never wish in a million years

01:15.985 --> 01:17.983
to assume this role under
these circumstances.

01:17.985 --> 01:21.063
There's a simple, plausible story
for you to stick to.

01:21.065 --> 01:23.343
And you will stick to it.

01:23.345 --> 01:24.383
Finally.

01:24.385 --> 01:25.823
We've got your shooter.

01:25.825 --> 01:27.743
Sergeant Andrew Apsted.

01:27.745 --> 01:30.143
Served in Helmand Province,
two tours.

01:30.145 --> 01:32.343
This could be the original
bomb-maker.

01:32.345 --> 01:36.863
The war in the desert, we've brought
it back to the streets of Britain.

01:36.865 --> 01:38.503
Andrew Apsted.

01:38.505 --> 01:39.543
We need more on him.

01:39.545 --> 01:42.263
Who he joined the Army with,
who he served with.

01:42.265 --> 01:43.983
And where did he get that rifle?

01:43.985 --> 01:45.183
A PSL, with no history.

01:45.185 --> 01:46.623
Traceable back to me.

01:46.625 --> 01:48.265
Maybe I can make a couple of calls.

01:51.545 --> 01:53.703
I thought they were sending you
a cab? Yeah.

01:53.705 --> 01:55.543
I don't need their shitty cab.

01:55.545 --> 01:59.623
Chanel Dyson was the late Home
Secretary's PR, until she was fired.

01:59.625 --> 02:02.223
Thank you for being such
a sweetheart that day.

02:02.225 --> 02:03.463
You're very welcome.

02:03.465 --> 02:05.145
Just cos I was going to suggest
a drink.

02:07.225 --> 02:10.423
The male subject has been identified
as Luke Aikens.

02:10.425 --> 02:13.183
Aikens is believed to be
a senior figure in organised

02:13.185 --> 02:14.425
criminal enterprises.

02:16.305 --> 02:19.063
Nadia, we're desperate to find
the person who's been creating

02:19.065 --> 02:20.383
these devices.

02:20.385 --> 02:22.025
Is this the man your husband met?

02:23.585 --> 02:25.263
Only problem is they know about you.

02:25.265 --> 02:27.543
That'll be David Budd.

02:27.545 --> 02:29.103
He's the only one who challenged me.

02:29.105 --> 02:31.463
In her hotel room a few days
before she was killed,

02:31.465 --> 02:33.703
the Home Secretary received
a visit from Longcross.

02:33.705 --> 02:36.023
He supplied her with an encrypted
file of kompromat

02:36.025 --> 02:38.103
she subsequently shared
with the Prime Minister.

02:38.105 --> 02:40.143
She offered them greater powers
in return for the

02:40.145 --> 02:43.623
<font color="yellow">compromising material.</font> A series
of scandals, all covered up.

02:43.625 --> 02:44.823
A sexual assault.

02:44.825 --> 02:46.063
Drug addiction.

02:46.065 --> 02:47.903
Financial impropriety.

02:47.905 --> 02:51.063
Last night, I learned they relate
to the Prime Minister.

02:51.065 --> 02:53.543
It looks like they're convinced
the kompromat wasn't with

02:53.545 --> 02:56.583
the Home Secretary at the time of
the explosion.

02:56.585 --> 02:58.423
It's still out there.

02:58.425 --> 03:01.625
They seem pretty sure if anyone
knows where it's hidden, you do.

03:03.865 --> 03:06.063
Julia Montague's home was
thoroughly searched,

03:06.065 --> 03:07.585
all of her devices seized.

03:09.025 --> 03:10.825
There was no tablet found.

03:17.865 --> 03:20.703
TV REPORTER: Six long weeks
have passed since the incident

03:20.705 --> 03:22.903
that triggered the current
terror alert...

03:22.905 --> 03:26.343
The Metropolitan Police remain on
the highest level of vigilance,

03:26.345 --> 03:29.023
responding to terror alerts
on a daily basis,

03:29.025 --> 03:30.943
most of them thankfully
false alarms...

03:30.945 --> 03:33.863
The police and Security Service MI5
stand at an almost

03:33.865 --> 03:37.743
unprecedented level of alertness
to a home-grown terror threat,

03:37.745 --> 03:41.143
yet still there have been no
further arrests, no breakthrough,

03:41.145 --> 03:44.503
and the assassination of
Home Secretary Julia Montague rem...

03:51.345 --> 03:53.303
VOICEMAIL: Hey, David, it's Chanel.

03:53.305 --> 03:55.943
Um, it was really lovely
to run into you.

03:55.945 --> 03:58.745
<font color="yellow">I meant it about that drink, may...
</font>

04:00.065 --> 04:01.223
David!

04:01.225 --> 04:04.143
I was getting worried you were
never going to call me back.

04:04.145 --> 04:05.623
Anything to play hard to get.

04:06.905 --> 04:08.423
Well, let's meet up.

04:08.425 --> 04:09.905
I know just the place.

04:11.000 --> 04:17.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:43.625 --> 04:44.665
Ma'am.

04:48.345 --> 04:49.385
As you were.

04:51.385 --> 04:52.903
<font color="yellow">Ma'am.</font> Deepak.

04:52.905 --> 04:54.983
<font color="yellow">Sorry, nobody told me...
</font>I wanted an update.

04:54.985 --> 04:56.223
Yes, ma'am.

04:56.225 --> 04:58.383
We've now interviewed all
the security staff on duty

04:58.385 --> 05:00.983
the night before the bombing
at St Matthew's College.

05:00.985 --> 05:04.823
They all claim not to have witnessed
any kind of break-in or intruder.

05:04.825 --> 05:06.063
"Claim"?

05:06.065 --> 05:07.703
The bomb didn't plant itself, ma'am.

05:07.705 --> 05:10.623
Maybe we're looking at bribery
and/or intimidation.

05:10.625 --> 05:14.183
They also needed access to the CCTV,
to delete part of the recording.

05:14.185 --> 05:16.703
This sounds like a new line
of inquiry.

05:16.705 --> 05:18.103
Yes, ma'am.

05:18.105 --> 05:19.663
Luke Aikens.

05:19.665 --> 05:21.983
We're exploring whether he
could've played a role in the

05:21.985 --> 05:23.583
assassination of the Home Secretary.

05:23.585 --> 05:26.303
Possible motivation being to prevent
increased scrutiny

05:26.305 --> 05:28.143
<font color="yellow">into criminal communications.
</font>RIPA-18?

05:28.145 --> 05:29.183
Yes, ma'am.

05:29.185 --> 05:33.023
Aikens is a significant player in
organised crime, and as you know,

05:33.025 --> 05:35.583
ma'am, he's always successfully
avoided criminal charges.

05:35.585 --> 05:36.625
"As I know"?

05:37.865 --> 05:39.703
Er, yes. I saw in the file.

05:39.705 --> 05:41.545
You led the Organised Crime Unit...

05:44.545 --> 05:47.265
..across the investigations
into Aikens' activities.

05:50.225 --> 05:51.423
Well, that was some time ago.

05:51.425 --> 05:53.983
Why wasn't I informed earlier about
this new line of inquiry?

05:53.985 --> 05:56.383
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, ma'am, I...
</font>Who initiated it?

05:56.385 --> 05:58.585
I'm acting on information
from David Budd.

06:08.425 --> 06:10.305
Every step forward,
we take one back.

06:28.545 --> 06:29.945
Something happened, boss?

06:31.305 --> 06:33.903
There's always been whispers
Luke Aikens had senior officers

06:33.905 --> 06:36.943
in his pocket - officers prepared
to sabotage investigations into

06:36.945 --> 06:38.065
his criminal empire.

06:39.385 --> 06:40.505
Our officers?

06:43.225 --> 06:45.903
There's still so much of the
Home Secretary's assassination

06:45.905 --> 06:48.263
we can't put together, but a lot
of it can be explained

06:48.265 --> 06:50.905
if all along there's been
an inside man...

06:52.465 --> 06:53.505
..or woman.

07:05.105 --> 07:06.145
You made it!

07:10.745 --> 07:12.663
Never one to turn down a free drink.

07:12.665 --> 07:14.503
We have a table downstairs,
if that's OK?

07:14.505 --> 07:15.863
It's your manor, your rules.

07:15.865 --> 07:17.343
What would you like to drink?

07:17.345 --> 07:18.383
Er...

07:18.385 --> 07:19.823
A beer's fine, please.

07:19.825 --> 07:22.943
Oh, cheap date!
The same again, please.

07:22.945 --> 07:25.105
But we'll have them downstairs.
Sure, Chanel.

07:28.545 --> 07:29.983
Welcome to my manor.

07:29.985 --> 07:32.143
Actually, it was good running
into you.

07:32.145 --> 07:33.983
Because here we are.

07:33.985 --> 07:35.863
That too. I...

07:35.865 --> 07:39.143
When you finished at the Home
Office, I heard a few things.

07:39.145 --> 07:40.183
About me?

07:40.185 --> 07:41.863
Yeah, about you.

07:41.865 --> 07:43.383
They were always beefing me.

07:43.385 --> 07:45.023
What was it this time?

07:45.025 --> 07:48.183
That your money comes from companies
registered offshore.

07:48.185 --> 07:49.623
So?

07:49.625 --> 07:52.783
I think there was a concern these
companies weren't fully legit.

07:52.785 --> 07:55.263
Listen, David, you're not
a business person.

07:55.265 --> 07:56.463
And I'm certainly not.

07:56.465 --> 07:58.423
I have clever people to do all that
for me.

07:58.425 --> 08:01.583
So, we could sit here and talk
about corporate law all night

08:01.585 --> 08:03.463
and neither of us will be any
the wiser.

08:03.465 --> 08:04.503
Fair point.

08:08.025 --> 08:09.783
Paid for with Nazi gold.

08:12.385 --> 08:13.425
Thank you.

08:17.105 --> 08:19.185
<font color="yellow">Cheers.</font> Cheers.

08:27.185 --> 08:28.423
What?

08:28.425 --> 08:29.985
Just trying to figure you out.

08:32.145 --> 08:36.543
Well, depending on who you talk to,
I'm either deceptively deep

08:36.544 --> 08:37.945
or deceptively shallow.

08:39.105 --> 08:40.705
Either way, you're deceptive.

08:43.505 --> 08:44.543
What's wrong?

08:44.545 --> 08:45.585
I'm sorry...

08:50.345 --> 08:51.385
Well?

08:53.145 --> 08:55.505
A...belt on the right-hand side.

09:03.185 --> 09:05.145
We don't normally allow coppers.

09:08.345 --> 09:10.783
And we definitely don't allow THEM.

09:10.785 --> 09:12.903
Makarov, is that right?

09:12.905 --> 09:14.745
Looks like someone's been talking.

09:16.185 --> 09:17.863
Well, you go around asking for
a PSL,

09:17.865 --> 09:19.625
it's going to come to my attention.

09:20.665 --> 09:21.945
You supply Andy Apsted?

09:26.785 --> 09:27.825
Tell me one thing.

09:30.185 --> 09:31.905
He come to you,
or did you go to him?

09:33.465 --> 09:35.105
Well, here's a question for you.

09:36.505 --> 09:38.303
Is that thing loaded?

09:38.305 --> 09:39.345
What do you think?

09:41.465 --> 09:43.545
It's what it's loaded with
that matters.

09:47.185 --> 09:48.545
You swapped in the blanks?

10:00.985 --> 10:03.623
Apologies, everyone. The lad's just
had too much to drink.

10:03.625 --> 10:05.465
Try not to let it spoil
your evening.

10:18.545 --> 10:20.983
Sarge, you're going to want
to log in to Thornton Circus.

10:20.985 --> 10:23.225
We've got something
on Andrew Apsted. Yeah?

10:46.185 --> 10:47.543
Boss.

10:47.545 --> 10:50.903
We've completed cross-checks on
everyone Andrew Apsted served

10:50.905 --> 10:52.863
alongside with in the Army.

10:52.865 --> 10:55.423
Apsted was posted
to Helmand Province

10:55.425 --> 10:57.823
with 16 Engineer Regiment in 2009.

10:57.825 --> 11:01.063
Now, there were a number
of operations carried out

11:01.065 --> 11:03.943
alongside the Royal Albion Regiment.

11:03.945 --> 11:06.665
And serving in the Royal Albion
at that time was, um...

11:09.945 --> 11:11.583
..was David Budd.

11:11.585 --> 11:12.625
Shit.

11:13.785 --> 11:15.383
Yeah.

11:15.385 --> 11:16.425
Yeah, it gets worse.

11:18.625 --> 11:21.023
Budd went back to Julia Montague's
house and broke in

11:21.025 --> 11:22.863
via the back entrance -
that's unguarded.

11:22.865 --> 11:25.143
I mean, he appears to have keys.

11:25.145 --> 11:27.303
He must've secretly got them cut
when he was her PPO,

11:27.305 --> 11:29.543
which is suspicious enough
in itself.

11:29.545 --> 11:32.023
I mean, he was only on the premises
for one or two minutes,

11:32.025 --> 11:34.143
which means he knew exactly
what he was after. <font color="cyan">Yeah.</font>

11:34.145 --> 11:35.185
The kompromat.

11:36.545 --> 11:37.665
You were right, boss.

11:39.625 --> 11:41.505
There's been an inside man
all along.

11:42.865 --> 11:44.503
The fucker has played me
since day one.

11:44.505 --> 11:45.545
He's played us all.

11:47.185 --> 11:49.265
We're going to be the ones
to bring him in.

11:51.745 --> 11:52.985
Let's find the bastard.

12:01.945 --> 12:04.463
POLICE RADIO: Observations for
a male wanted in connection

12:04.465 --> 12:06.463
with the murder of Julia Montague.

12:06.465 --> 12:11.783
Police Sergeant David Budd,
IC1 male, early 30s, dark hair.

12:11.785 --> 12:14.543
Subject may be armed
and is extremely dangerous.

12:14.545 --> 12:18.465
Repeat, David Budd is to be treated
as extremely dangerous.

14:25.585 --> 14:29.105
Mrs Budd, do you know the name
Andrew Apsted?

14:30.225 --> 14:31.263
No.

14:31.265 --> 14:33.943
Apsted and David served
in Afghanistan together.

14:33.945 --> 14:36.023
Apsted had a history of
post-traumatic stress

14:36.025 --> 14:37.145
and took his own life.

14:38.185 --> 14:41.103
One of our current lines of inquiry
is that Apsted and your

14:41.105 --> 14:43.463
husband were accomplices in
the Thornton Circus attempt

14:43.465 --> 14:44.985
on the Home Secretary's life.

14:46.385 --> 14:47.423
No... No!

14:47.425 --> 14:48.623
Dave would never...

14:48.625 --> 14:52.863
David has lied and lied
to all of us, you included,

14:52.865 --> 14:56.265
and our priority now is to bring him
safely into custody.

14:57.385 --> 15:00.705
Has he said anything to you that
might shed some light on his plans?

15:01.865 --> 15:03.063
Um...

15:03.065 --> 15:05.983
Well, he did say one thing
the last time I saw him,

15:05.985 --> 15:07.543
which really worried me.

15:07.545 --> 15:11.423
He said he needed to act now
"before it was too late".

15:11.425 --> 15:12.543
I...

15:12.545 --> 15:13.583
Is he in danger?

15:13.585 --> 15:16.543
Mrs Budd, I believe what David meant
by "before it's too late"

15:16.545 --> 15:19.503
is before his link to Andrew Apsted
was detected.

15:19.505 --> 15:22.263
Hence all the lies
and the betrayals.

15:22.265 --> 15:25.943
Now, I'd like you to accompany me
to Walworth Police Station

15:25.945 --> 15:27.863
to help with our inquiries, OK?

15:27.865 --> 15:31.423
Vicky, Ella and Charlie are safe
and well, no sightings of David,

15:31.425 --> 15:33.463
but we've dispatched an officer
to the school for

15:33.465 --> 15:35.343
<font color="cyan">safeguarding purposes.</font> No.

15:35.345 --> 15:36.983
Dave would never hurt the kids.

15:36.985 --> 15:38.023
Never.

15:38.025 --> 15:39.265
Who would he hurt?

15:47.665 --> 15:48.983
Madam, don't be alarmed.

15:48.985 --> 15:51.143
Please can I use your telephone?

15:51.145 --> 15:53.385
Please, I just need some help,
ma'am, please.

15:57.545 --> 15:59.903
Madam, stop! Police officer.

15:59.905 --> 16:01.223
I understand the state I look.

16:01.225 --> 16:02.903
My name's
Police Sergeant David Budd.

16:02.905 --> 16:05.623
Do you have a mobile telephone,
please? Uh...

16:05.625 --> 16:08.823
All I need you to do is call 999
and hold the phone on speaker

16:08.825 --> 16:10.463
so I can contact
the Police Operator.

16:10.465 --> 16:12.543
The call's free of charge.

16:12.545 --> 16:15.185
Madam, it's an emergency.
Please.

16:17.705 --> 16:18.745
Thank you.

16:21.185 --> 16:23.743
<font color="cyan">Emergency, which service
do you require?</font> Police.

16:23.745 --> 16:25.025
Putting you through now.

16:26.705 --> 16:28.623
Police, what is your emergency?

16:28.625 --> 16:31.103
PS David Budd, using a member of
the public's phone,

16:31.105 --> 16:33.785
I am Status Zero on
Saltmarsh Street.

16:35.185 --> 16:37.303
Can you confirm your name, please?

16:37.305 --> 16:38.825
Police Sergeant David Budd.

16:40.705 --> 16:42.583
Units are on their way, PS Budd.

16:42.585 --> 16:45.185
Please return the phone
to the member of the public.

16:47.385 --> 16:48.545
What's going on?

16:54.705 --> 16:55.745
Shit.

17:17.025 --> 17:18.143
Obs on David Budd.

17:18.145 --> 17:19.343
Saltmarsh Street.

17:19.345 --> 17:21.663
Received. Saltmarsh Street,
blue-light it.

17:27.025 --> 17:28.303
What's going on?

17:28.305 --> 17:30.143
I need your full cooperation, Vicky.

17:30.145 --> 17:32.505
This could turn into
a negotiation situation.

17:57.385 --> 17:59.345
Control Trojan,
stand by for sit-rep.

18:02.465 --> 18:03.745
Did you see where he went?

18:04.985 --> 18:06.465
Extend the search outwards.

18:08.585 --> 18:09.703
Come with me.

18:09.705 --> 18:12.385
Trojan sit-rep -
unarmed, clear to enter.

18:20.105 --> 18:21.143
Sarge.

18:21.145 --> 18:22.423
PS Mason, ma'am.

18:22.425 --> 18:23.863
Lorraine Craddock, Budd's boss.

18:23.865 --> 18:25.783
I'm hoping I can talk him into
cooperating.

18:25.785 --> 18:26.825
Ma'am.

18:36.465 --> 18:39.263
Ma'am, DS Rayburn, SO15.

18:39.265 --> 18:40.705
I've got Budd's wife with me.

18:48.065 --> 18:50.463
I'm cooperating. Don't shoot!

18:50.465 --> 18:52.303
Armed police! Hands in the air!

18:52.305 --> 18:54.423
<font color="yellow">Don't shoot!</font> Hands in the air now!

18:54.425 --> 18:56.823
<font color="yellow">I can't!</font> David, please do as we say!

18:56.825 --> 18:58.063
No-one needs to get hurt!

18:58.065 --> 18:59.463
I need to explain!

18:59.465 --> 19:00.703
Raise your hands!

19:00.705 --> 19:03.223
David, please. Raise your hands!

19:03.225 --> 19:04.703
Final warning!

19:04.705 --> 19:06.705
RAISE YOUR HANDS!

19:08.825 --> 19:09.863
Shit!

19:09.865 --> 19:10.905
Pull back!

19:12.105 --> 19:13.145
Clear the area!

19:16.505 --> 19:17.783
David, don't move!

19:17.785 --> 19:19.503
Stay perfectly still!

19:19.505 --> 19:20.785
It's a dead man's switch!

19:22.345 --> 19:24.423
Anything happens to me,
it'll go off.

19:24.425 --> 19:26.103

19:27.225 --> 19:28.343
I didn't do this!

19:28.345 --> 19:29.423
You need to believe me.

19:29.425 --> 19:32.423
Subject armed with PBIED,
require safe route.

19:32.425 --> 19:34.463
We need Expo here and a negotiator.

19:34.465 --> 19:35.505
Ma'am.

19:36.665 --> 19:38.303
Control, Charlie Yankee Five Seven,

19:38.305 --> 19:40.703
request Expo and negotiator
to Saltmarsh Street.

19:40.705 --> 19:42.423
I didn't do this!

19:42.425 --> 19:44.303
I was put in this vest!

19:44.305 --> 19:47.145
We need to get him away from
all these buildings. <font color="lime">Agreed.</font>

19:48.745 --> 19:51.223
We need to move you to
a less built-up area!

19:51.225 --> 19:52.343
It's a DMS.

19:52.345 --> 19:53.383
Don't shoot!

19:53.385 --> 19:55.263
You need you to comply right now!

19:55.265 --> 19:57.463
I AM COMPLYING! Do not shoot!

19:57.465 --> 20:00.545
Turn around slowly with your hands

20:02.065 --> 20:04.623
RADIO: Trojan, route via
Saltmarsh Mews.

20:04.625 --> 20:05.665
Wait!

20:07.425 --> 20:12.025

walk there slowly now.

20:14.985 --> 20:17.223
Control from Trojan, active message.

20:17.225 --> 20:18.945

No sudden moves.

Pope Square,

Armed police, get back!

20:31.385 --> 20:36.303
Left turn into Pope Lane, followed
by right turn into Pope Square.

20:36.305 --> 20:39.303

Keep walking!

20:59.505 --> 21:01.985
Sir, we're just tapping
into the CCTV camera now.

21:05.505 --> 21:09.103
Get out of the park!
Keep it moving!

21:15.025 --> 21:16.863
Keep moving.

21:16.865 --> 21:19.425
As far away from the buildings
as possible.

21:29.465 --> 21:33.383
Control, Trojan.
Subject now confined to Pope Square.

21:33.385 --> 21:35.583
Require critical shot authorisation.

21:35.585 --> 21:37.545
Received, stand by.

21:43.305 --> 21:45.543
He's saying it's trigger-activated.

21:45.545 --> 21:47.863
<font color="lime">Are we safe to get a radio to him?
</font>Ma'am?

21:47.865 --> 21:49.823
If we're going to get him
to surrender,

21:49.825 --> 21:51.505
we'll need to be able to talk.

21:58.785 --> 22:02.103
David, I'm going to lay the radio
down for you, OK?

22:02.105 --> 22:04.385
Do not move yet!

22:05.785 --> 22:07.025
OK!

22:15.905 --> 22:18.103
Bring the wife, just in case, OK?

22:18.105 --> 22:19.665
Got the radio? Cheers.

22:24.225 --> 22:26.145
Stay still until I tell you.

22:28.545 --> 22:29.945
OK.

22:34.625 --> 22:36.465
Pick up the radio!

22:57.145 --> 22:59.263
Back to back on 2.

22:59.265 --> 23:02.703
David, please listen to me
very carefully.

23:02.705 --> 23:06.103
I really hope this can be resolved
with no-one getting hurt.

23:06.105 --> 23:10.503
For your own sake,
for your family and colleagues,

23:10.505 --> 23:12.665
please give yourself up.

23:14.785 --> 23:17.063
Ma'am, I've tried
to remove the vest.

23:17.065 --> 23:20.343
It's booby-trapped with co-ax
connectors across the clasps.

23:20.345 --> 23:22.503
They're wired to the control unit.

23:22.505 --> 23:26.503
I give you my solemn promise
your previous good service

23:26.505 --> 23:29.383
and the effect of your recent
traumatic experiences

23:29.385 --> 23:32.303
<font color="lime">will be taken into account.
</font>Ma'am, you're not listening to me.

23:32.305 --> 23:35.743
I was knocked unconscious.
When I came round I was in this vest

23:35.745 --> 23:37.463
with my thumb taped to the DMS.

23:37.465 --> 23:40.063
David, you've got to be
straight with us.

23:40.065 --> 23:43.063
You hid your relationship
with Apsted.

23:43.065 --> 23:46.383
You hid your involvement in
Julia Montague's assassination.

23:46.385 --> 23:49.463
I had nothing to do with
Julia's assassination, nothing!

23:49.465 --> 23:50.783
I tried to save her!

23:50.785 --> 23:54.103
David, you've betrayed
everyone's trust.

23:54.105 --> 23:56.223
We won't be fooled again.

23:56.225 --> 23:58.305
I'm telling the truth!

24:00.265 --> 24:03.943
I'm sorry, David.
I did my best for you.

24:03.945 --> 24:07.983
What? Your best? What are you doing?

24:07.985 --> 24:09.943
This is an SO15 operation.

24:09.945 --> 24:11.745
Ma'am, what are you doing?

24:14.225 --> 24:16.545
David, let's try
and stay calm, yeah?

24:17.625 --> 24:19.583
David, are you receiving me?

24:19.585 --> 24:21.223
Vic, get away from here!

24:21.225 --> 24:24.025
<font color="cyan">Dave, they want me here.
</font><font color="yellow">Get away!</font>

24:25.865 --> 24:28.783
Just get Expo here, Louise,
please, get me out of this thing.

24:28.785 --> 24:32.183
Stay still and keep your hands
where we can see them.

24:32.185 --> 24:34.343
My hand is on the DMS.

24:34.345 --> 24:36.863
What's the matter with you?
Are you blind?

24:36.865 --> 24:38.583
No, David.

24:38.585 --> 24:40.143
I'm being set up!

24:40.145 --> 24:43.663
The people that did this to me,
they're the ones who killed Julia!

24:45.465 --> 24:47.465
OK, David.

24:49.345 --> 24:51.703
Louise, I know I betrayed
your trust.

24:51.705 --> 24:53.663
I lied about Andy Apsted.

24:53.665 --> 24:55.743
But if I'd come clean,
I'd have been the fall guy

24:55.745 --> 24:57.583
and the people
that really killed Julia

24:57.585 --> 25:00.463
would have gotten away with it.
I didn't wanted to lie. I had to!

25:00.465 --> 25:02.503
David, please,
just do what they say!

25:02.505 --> 25:03.743
She's fine.

25:03.745 --> 25:05.743
David, you need help, please!

25:05.745 --> 25:07.505
Vic, I'm telling the truth!

25:08.825 --> 25:10.543
Trojan, Control.

25:10.545 --> 25:12.943
Go ahead, Control.

Line of fire, behind me.

25:28.825 --> 25:31.183
I know I lied, I hid things,
but you have to understand

25:31.185 --> 25:33.423
I had nothing to do with
Andy trying to kill Julia.

25:33.425 --> 25:35.263
Nothing to do with the bomb
that killed her.

25:35.265 --> 25:36.943
I wanted to know who did it.

25:36.945 --> 25:38.663
I don't know who did it!

25:38.665 --> 25:41.943
It was Security Service,
Organised Crime, terrorism -

25:41.945 --> 25:43.825
that's what I was trying
to find out.

25:45.785 --> 25:48.023
Pictures up.

25:48.025 --> 25:51.223
RADIO: Also an SO15 DS
awaiting Silver to Status Six.

25:55.505 --> 25:57.823
DAVID: I know you think I'm lying...

25:57.825 --> 25:59.983
Any RT revealing
what he's told them so far?

25:59.985 --> 26:02.223
No, sir. Get this blown up.

26:02.225 --> 26:05.423
Sir. ..the conspiracy, whatever,
to kill Julia.

26:05.425 --> 26:08.103
There was security pictures
of St Matthew's College.

26:08.105 --> 26:10.823
They knew about
the Home Secretary's itinerary.

26:10.825 --> 26:12.343
By me, sir.

26:12.345 --> 26:14.703
<font color="yellow">Silver, Status Six.
</font><font color="lime">Control, received.</font>

26:14.705 --> 26:17.903
Boss. Any idea what kind of
explosive's in the device?

26:17.905 --> 26:19.023
Not yet, no, boss,

26:19.025 --> 26:21.583
and I wouldn't hold much store
in Budd's answers either.

26:21.585 --> 26:23.703
It's been a stream of bullshit
since day one.

26:23.705 --> 26:26.583
All right, Louise, I hear you, but
let's lower the temperature a bit.

26:26.585 --> 26:28.425
<font color="cyan">What channel?</font> Two.

26:29.505 --> 26:31.423
David, Deepak Sharma, receiving?

26:31.425 --> 26:33.025
Receiving.

26:34.425 --> 26:36.625
What can you tell us
about the PBIED?

26:38.465 --> 26:40.983
It resembles the device
worn by Nadia Ali

26:40.985 --> 26:42.745
during the 1st of October attack.

26:44.025 --> 26:45.623
How can you be so sure?

26:45.625 --> 26:48.023
I saw hers up close
before it was con-exed.

26:48.025 --> 26:50.383
The HE, the detonators,
the control unit.

26:50.385 --> 26:52.263
Mine appear exactly the same.

26:52.265 --> 26:55.023
You understand our doubts here,
mate? Our inquiries have led us to

26:55.025 --> 26:57.143
the probability of an inside man
within the force

26:57.145 --> 26:59.343
who conspired in
the security breaches necessary

26:59.345 --> 27:00.983
to assassinate the Home Secretary.

27:00.985 --> 27:02.983
I'm not the inside man!

27:02.985 --> 27:04.983
But here you are,
wearing the exact same PBIED

27:04.985 --> 27:06.625
employed by an active terror cell.

27:07.745 --> 27:09.223
This is how it happened, sir.

27:09.225 --> 27:11.663
I was contacted by Chanel Dyson.

27:11.665 --> 27:15.583
She set a trap. I was ambushed by
Luke Aikens and put into this vest,

27:15.585 --> 27:18.703
to frame me, to point the finger
away from Organised Crime.

27:18.705 --> 27:21.423
You keep asking us to believe you,
David, and now you're telling us

27:21.425 --> 27:23.943
you're arranging a secret meeting
with one of the suspects.

27:23.945 --> 27:26.783
I was trying to trace
Andy Apsted's PSL rifle!

27:26.785 --> 27:28.423
It was supplied by Luke Aikens.

27:28.425 --> 27:30.383
It was his men
that broke into my flat.

27:30.385 --> 27:31.823
Why do you think that, David?

27:31.825 --> 27:34.343
I used a pistol I brought back
from Afghanistan as bait.

27:34.345 --> 27:37.343
Luke knew all about it.
Knew it had been tampered with.

27:40.905 --> 27:42.143
Look, ask Vic. She knows.

27:42.145 --> 27:44.663
She knows! She'll prove
that I'm telling the truth.

27:44.665 --> 27:46.185
Vicky, will you tell him?

27:48.425 --> 27:50.023
He's telling the truth.

27:50.025 --> 27:52.423
The pistol,
someone tampered with the bullets,

27:52.425 --> 27:54.023
they replaced them with blanks.

27:54.025 --> 27:55.545
How do you know this?

27:56.865 --> 27:58.823
After the Home Secretary died,

27:58.825 --> 28:00.783
David tried to shoot himself.

28:00.785 --> 28:03.303
But, look, why would Dave
try and shoot himself with a blank,

28:03.305 --> 28:05.743
unless he didn't realise the gun
had been tampered with?

28:05.745 --> 28:07.345
Thank you.

28:09.425 --> 28:11.903
David, clearly we need
to look into this further.

28:11.905 --> 28:13.983
But we're being told
that you're suicidal,

28:13.985 --> 28:15.863
and now here you are
in a suicide vest.

28:15.865 --> 28:19.143
No, no, no! That's not it,
that's not the point here!

28:19.145 --> 28:21.663
Where's this pistol now, mate?
You got it with you?

28:21.665 --> 28:23.983
No, Luke's men seized it
before they fitted the vest.

28:23.985 --> 28:26.743
Look, forget the pistol, it's
the blank rounds that are proof.

28:26.745 --> 28:28.823
I've still got them.
They're hidden in my flat.

28:28.825 --> 28:30.223
Maybe you can pull DNA,

28:30.225 --> 28:32.863
prints from them that are going
to link it back to Luke's men.

28:32.865 --> 28:34.823
All this evidence
you've kept hidden.

28:34.825 --> 28:38.223
We know you broke into
Julia Montague's flat.

28:38.225 --> 28:41.503
Led me up the garden path
on that one, too.

28:41.505 --> 28:43.623
I am sorry about that, Louise.
I had to.

28:43.625 --> 28:46.103
I couldn't risk what I found
being common knowledge.

28:46.105 --> 28:49.663
Why, David? Why couldn't you
trust your colleagues?

28:49.665 --> 28:52.585
Because of the conspiracy.
Because of the Security Service.

28:54.225 --> 28:56.783
I found where Julia
hid the kompromat.

28:56.785 --> 28:59.263
<font color="lime">Phone.</font> The tablet.

28:59.265 --> 29:00.705
Where is it, David?

29:02.305 --> 29:06.105
My flat, downstairs,
in the bathroom, above a spotlight.

29:07.385 --> 29:09.983
Budd's flat. Downstairs bathroom.
Above a spotlight.

29:09.985 --> 29:11.303
Seconds away.

29:11.305 --> 29:13.983
Budd's flat. Turn right.

29:15.825 --> 29:17.623
Do you give consent to search?

29:17.625 --> 29:19.383
Yes, sir.

29:19.385 --> 29:21.343
Control, Silver,
I need a search team

29:21.345 --> 29:24.425
<font color="cyan">to David Budd's address immediately.
</font><font color="yellow">Look at me.</font>

29:34.265 --> 29:36.065
They're changing radio channels.

29:45.345 --> 29:47.183
Security Service
may be monitoring this,

29:47.185 --> 29:49.063
so do not share via
any regular channels.

29:49.065 --> 29:51.303
Advise search team not to tamper
with the spotlight,

29:51.305 --> 29:53.145
to hold back from entering
the property.

29:56.305 --> 29:57.503
Received.

29:57.505 --> 29:59.103
What's the message? What's Budd say?

29:59.105 --> 30:01.105
Sorry, sir,
they're too quick for us.

30:18.025 --> 30:21.263
Aaah! Aah!

30:21.265 --> 30:22.583
Armed police!

30:22.585 --> 30:24.823
<font color="lime">Get down on the ground!
</font><font color="yellow">Hands where I can see them.</font>

30:24.825 --> 30:26.303
<font color="lime">Down on the ground!</font> Search him!

30:26.305 --> 30:27.625
Don't move!

30:32.305 --> 30:34.263
One in custody.

30:34.265 --> 30:36.625
Matching e-fit of Richard Longcross.

30:41.385 --> 30:43.065
Fuck.

30:45.145 --> 30:46.665
Hold Expo.

30:49.265 --> 30:51.105
They need to get this thing off me!

30:52.785 --> 30:55.023
I would if I could, mate,
but you know the drill.

30:55.025 --> 30:57.823
There's a risk you'll trigger
the device to take them with you.

30:57.825 --> 31:00.383
I don't want anyone here
getting hurt.

31:00.385 --> 31:03.265
My hand's aching on this DMS!

31:04.865 --> 31:06.665
I want to talk to my wife.

31:09.385 --> 31:11.383
It might be the last chance I get.

31:11.385 --> 31:12.785
Please.

31:19.385 --> 31:21.145
Go set to set on 3.

31:23.105 --> 31:24.945
Press here when you want to talk.

31:29.345 --> 31:31.303
I've let you down, Vic, I know that.

31:31.305 --> 31:33.663
But on our children's lives,
I'm not a traitor

31:33.665 --> 31:35.945
and I had nothing to do
with Julia's murder.

31:37.465 --> 31:39.505
I'm sorry for
what I've put you through.

31:42.105 --> 31:44.585
I'm sorry I've stopped being
the man you married.

31:46.465 --> 31:48.903
I've tried to explain,

31:48.905 --> 31:52.025
but part of me never wants to
explain what the war did to me.

31:53.425 --> 31:56.383
I never wanted it to touch you,
or us,

31:56.385 --> 31:58.703
but it has.

31:58.705 --> 32:00.945
I tried to stop it, but I couldn't.

32:05.385 --> 32:08.463
I've failed as a husband,
and as a father,

32:08.465 --> 32:10.183
and that's the worst thing.

32:10.185 --> 32:11.865
I'm sorry.

32:14.425 --> 32:16.145
Help him! Why won't you help him?

32:20.785 --> 32:22.105
Please.

32:23.625 --> 32:25.545
Let me examine the device, sir.

32:31.465 --> 32:32.623
OK.

32:32.625 --> 32:33.903
Thank you, thank you!

32:33.905 --> 32:35.625
Ballistic shields.

32:44.265 --> 32:46.265
With me.

32:51.225 --> 32:55.705
Any sudden moves,
any shout from me, take him out.

32:57.545 --> 32:58.825
Hold.

33:11.265 --> 33:12.943
My name's Daniel Chung.

33:12.945 --> 33:16.903
I'm going to begin by
examining this device. Thank you.

33:16.905 --> 33:18.423
I'm David.

33:18.425 --> 33:19.983
David...

33:19.985 --> 33:23.105
..remain perfectly still
with your hands facing me.

33:24.585 --> 33:26.383
Apart from the dead man's switch,

33:26.385 --> 33:28.743
are there any other
initiation devices?

33:28.745 --> 33:31.103
To the best of my knowledge, no.

33:31.105 --> 33:33.545
David, keep pressure on the DMS.

33:35.345 --> 33:38.583
I need you to turn very slowly
through 360 degrees

33:38.585 --> 33:40.905
so I can inspect the whole device.

34:13.625 --> 34:15.263
Thank you.

34:15.264 --> 34:17.745
I don't see any
hidden initiation devices.

34:19.145 --> 34:21.465
Now I'm going to carry out
a closer examination.

34:22.585 --> 34:25.503
Please remain completely still,
maintaining pressure on the DMS.

34:25.505 --> 34:26.905
I will.

34:31.105 --> 34:36.303
The co-ax wires across the clasps
are wired into the control unit.

34:36.304 --> 34:39.183
I'm going to examine
the control unit now.

34:39.185 --> 34:41.263
Please remain perfectly still
for me, David,

34:41.264 --> 34:43.065
maintaining pressure on the DMS.

35:19.665 --> 35:21.503
David, I've completed
my examination,

35:21.505 --> 35:23.743
and now I need to confer with
my colleagues.

35:23.745 --> 35:26.303
Stay here,
remaining perfectly still,

35:26.305 --> 35:28.865
and keep maintaining pressure
on the DMS.

35:31.505 --> 35:32.745
No. Come back.

35:34.705 --> 35:36.343
Come back!

35:45.545 --> 35:47.103
<font color="cyan">Ma'am.</font> Ma'am.

35:47.105 --> 35:50.183
Great work on getting Longcross
into custody. <font color="cyan">Ma'am.</font> Well done.

35:50.185 --> 35:53.025
Budd's device appears to be the work
of the original bomb-maker.

35:56.945 --> 36:01.743
It's impossible to tell if he put it
on himself or someone did it to him.

36:01.745 --> 36:04.143
I read the report on
the 1/10 device.

36:04.145 --> 36:06.023
This is equally sophisticated.

36:06.025 --> 36:08.023
Can it be defused?

36:08.025 --> 36:11.665
I can try, but there's an extremely
high risk of detonation.

36:13.425 --> 36:14.825
What's happening?

36:17.305 --> 36:19.463
This is Anne Sampson, David.

36:19.465 --> 36:22.783
Tell us, are there other bombers
at large?

36:22.785 --> 36:24.863
Not that I know of.

36:24.865 --> 36:26.905
Are further attacks planned?

36:28.625 --> 36:30.223
I don't know.

36:30.225 --> 36:32.903
Who built the device you're wearing?

36:32.905 --> 36:34.943
Ma'am, this wasn't my doing.

36:34.945 --> 36:36.705
I don't know who built it.

36:42.065 --> 36:44.663
We've got no idea of the power
of the device

36:44.665 --> 36:46.543
or how long he can hold the DMS.

36:46.545 --> 36:48.823
Added to which, Budd's got a history
of deception

36:48.825 --> 36:51.063
and is highly likely to be
the inside man

36:51.065 --> 36:52.905
who's enabled this conspiracy.

36:58.105 --> 37:00.623
Get everyone to pull back
outside the cordons

37:00.625 --> 37:02.145
and then we'll re-spin the wheel.

37:05.705 --> 37:07.183
Deepak.

37:07.185 --> 37:08.343
Ma'am.

37:08.345 --> 37:09.903
Everyone pull back!

37:09.905 --> 37:11.145
Pull back.

37:13.945 --> 37:15.583
David.

37:15.585 --> 37:17.543
Please!

37:17.545 --> 37:19.023
Mrs Budd.

37:19.025 --> 37:20.903
I'm innocent! Please!

37:20.905 --> 37:22.623
You're killing me!

37:22.625 --> 37:25.663
Pull back to a safe distance,
please.

37:25.665 --> 37:27.185
I love you.

37:28.385 --> 37:29.943
See what she's up to?

37:29.945 --> 37:32.943
All the easier to pin everything
on David when he's dead.

37:32.945 --> 37:35.105
She's the one with links
to Luke Aikens.

37:36.785 --> 37:38.145
Quick as you can.

37:44.905 --> 37:47.383
If I stay put,
she'll order the shot.

37:47.385 --> 37:49.025
If I run, she'll do the same.

37:51.425 --> 37:53.705
No! Stop! Stop her!

37:55.105 --> 37:57.943
Vicky, no! <font color="lime">Hold fire! Hold fire!
</font>Vic, it's too dangerous.

37:57.945 --> 38:00.383
That's Charlie and Ella
losing the both of us.

38:00.385 --> 38:02.863
I believe you, Dave,
I believe that you're innocent.

38:02.865 --> 38:04.783
This gives you a chance to prove it.

38:04.785 --> 38:08.585
Trojan to TFC, subject's wife now
in close proximity to device.

38:11.225 --> 38:15.703
Trojan, TFC.
SFC rescinds critical shot.

38:15.705 --> 38:17.305
Off aim!

38:23.305 --> 38:24.745
Budd to Sampson.

38:26.385 --> 38:28.263
Sampson.

38:28.265 --> 38:31.463
I'll lead you to the evidence
that proves I'm telling the truth.

38:31.465 --> 38:33.823
Stay where you are.

38:33.825 --> 38:35.025
What now?

38:36.425 --> 38:37.983
Stay close.

38:37.985 --> 38:39.265
We walk.

38:41.105 --> 38:42.265
David!

38:43.945 --> 38:45.663
David!

38:45.665 --> 38:47.425
DAVID!

38:51.105 --> 38:55.303
Mobile containment -
100 metres rolling cordon.

38:55.305 --> 38:58.063
Red team with me.
Get traffic control in place

38:58.065 --> 39:00.825
<font color="lime">to create a safety corridor.
</font><font color="cyan">Ma'am.</font>

39:02.665 --> 39:05.823
Help us out here, mate.
Where are you going?

39:05.825 --> 39:07.223
My flat.

39:07.225 --> 39:08.625
Long walk ahead.

39:14.185 --> 39:16.343
The incident began
earlier this morning

39:16.345 --> 39:19.343
with reports of a man wearing
a suicide vest

39:19.345 --> 39:22.063
causing a disturbance
in Saltmarsh Street.

39:22.065 --> 39:24.223
Specialist Firearms Officers

39:24.225 --> 39:28.223
of the Metropolitan Police's
counter-terrorism unit, SCO19,

39:28.225 --> 39:30.063
attended the incident
within a few minutes

39:30.065 --> 39:32.703
and the area was closed
to the public.

39:32.705 --> 39:34.383
The incident moved to Pope Square...

39:34.385 --> 39:37.223
You had the whole situation
locked down.

39:37.225 --> 39:39.663
We've got an innocent civilian
in harm's way

39:39.665 --> 39:42.903
and Budd claims to be leading us
to crucial evidence.

39:42.905 --> 39:45.023
He's making for his home address.

39:45.025 --> 39:48.263
Armed units are in situ
and residents are being evacuated.

39:48.265 --> 39:51.303
Air Ops are also conducting
neighbourhood surveillance

39:51.305 --> 39:54.103
for possible associates.
So far, none detected.

39:54.105 --> 39:55.543
Then who's he working with?

39:55.545 --> 39:59.983
We've established a link to Andrew
Apsted, the Thornton Circus sniper.

39:59.985 --> 40:01.745
I see.

40:03.105 --> 40:04.425
Ah.

40:07.625 --> 40:10.943
You never said you were including
the Security Service.

40:10.945 --> 40:14.065
Anne, Anne,
we're all in this together.

40:18.665 --> 40:20.623
Stephen?

40:20.625 --> 40:24.463
You may be interested to hear my
officers have taken into custody

40:24.465 --> 40:28.383
a male suspect matching
the e-fit of Richard Longcross.

40:28.385 --> 40:31.383
And we're currently exploring
a number of lines of inquiry

40:31.385 --> 40:34.063
in association with the suspect,

40:34.065 --> 40:39.863
such as places of work and seizure
of communications devices.

40:39.865 --> 40:43.703
I can neither confirm nor deny
the suspect's identity,

40:43.705 --> 40:47.463
but what I can confirm is that
the requisite authorities apply

40:47.465 --> 40:49.583
which render his actions lawful.

40:49.585 --> 40:51.863
He should be released immediately.

40:51.865 --> 40:54.943
There are certain actions for which
there are no lawful authorities,

40:54.945 --> 40:56.623
one being the assassination of

40:56.625 --> 40:59.143
a democratically elected
secretary of state.

40:59.145 --> 41:02.505
Anne, please.
Cool heads and cooperation.

41:06.065 --> 41:10.183
This "cooperation" - is it due
to Budd's compromising material

41:10.185 --> 41:12.183
giving you both so much to lose

41:12.185 --> 41:15.263
that you never want its existence
revealed?

41:15.265 --> 41:17.863
Because it would show the hand
of the Security Service

41:17.865 --> 41:21.663
in a failed coup, and despite
your convincing assurances

41:21.665 --> 41:24.383
that the Home Office's role
in Julia Montague's death

41:24.385 --> 41:26.543
was purely accidental,

41:26.545 --> 41:29.223
I wonder if the public
will be equally convinced?

41:29.225 --> 41:32.545
OK, Anne, I think it's best if
Stephen and I continue without you.

41:34.425 --> 41:35.945
A woman was murdered.

41:37.305 --> 41:39.543
A crime was committed.

41:39.545 --> 41:41.505
My officers will investigate.

41:45.025 --> 41:46.545
Thanks.

41:53.825 --> 41:56.303
I've sought a court order
for my officer's release.

41:56.305 --> 41:57.745
Good.

41:59.065 --> 42:01.543
Budd claims to hold
crucial evidence.

42:01.545 --> 42:04.343
He was working with
the Thornton Circus sniper.

42:04.345 --> 42:08.863
Andrew Apsted was a disturbed,
embittered war veteran.

42:08.865 --> 42:12.023
Not only does Budd
fit the same profile,

42:12.025 --> 42:16.503
he possessed all the inside know-how
to overcome Julia's security.

42:16.505 --> 42:19.505
No wider conspiracy involved.

42:22.185 --> 42:25.263
Look no further
for Julia's assassin.

42:25.265 --> 42:27.825
..an evacuation is taking place.

42:58.905 --> 43:00.625
How are you doing?

43:02.945 --> 43:04.785
My hand's in spasm.

43:32.585 --> 43:33.985
You need to go inside.

43:35.265 --> 43:36.825
It's OK. It's completely safe.

43:38.025 --> 43:40.183
Cupboard in the kitchen.
There's some rope.

43:40.185 --> 43:41.583
Rope? What for?

43:41.585 --> 43:43.265
And a spade.

44:14.465 --> 44:17.223
There's something down here -
like a black plastic bag.

44:17.225 --> 44:18.785
That's it, Vic.

44:26.105 --> 44:28.183
This is the evidence.

44:28.185 --> 44:30.463
The original tablet
containing the kompromat.

44:30.465 --> 44:32.983
It'll prove the Security Service
was involved.

44:32.985 --> 44:35.463
The blank rounds that were
smuggled into my pistol,

44:35.465 --> 44:37.625
they'll prove Organised Crime were,
too.

44:43.465 --> 44:45.383
Send Vicky to us with the evidence.

44:45.385 --> 44:47.145
If I go, they can shoot you.

44:50.905 --> 44:53.385
I don't know how much longer
I can hold the DMS.

44:54.625 --> 44:57.423
This vest is crucial evidence.
The others all got blown up.

44:57.425 --> 45:00.223
If forensics got a chance
to examine this,

45:00.225 --> 45:02.703
it might lead us back to
the bomb-maker.

45:02.705 --> 45:04.583
Prevent further attacks.

45:04.585 --> 45:06.503
He's bargaining, boss,
he's playing you.

45:06.505 --> 45:08.983
Or he's giving us the chance
to crack this case.

45:08.985 --> 45:12.143
I'll send Vicky to you
with the evidence.

45:12.145 --> 45:14.463
No, Dave, don't fall for it.

45:14.465 --> 45:17.545
If you give me a chance
to defuse this.

45:20.065 --> 45:21.825
How do you know I'll keep my side?

45:24.265 --> 45:27.065
I've been a soldier,
I've been a copper.

45:28.425 --> 45:30.705
You get to spot a bloke
whose word's his bond.

45:34.065 --> 45:36.183
You happy to let him try?

45:36.185 --> 45:37.905
I wouldn't say "happy".

45:39.465 --> 45:40.905
Robot.

45:51.105 --> 45:52.545
Vicky.

45:55.025 --> 45:57.025
How are things with your boyfriend?

45:59.825 --> 46:01.585
All right.

46:02.945 --> 46:04.825
You deserve to be happy.

46:21.505 --> 46:23.903
I've laid out what you'll need.

46:23.905 --> 46:27.625
The robot's coming up to you,
so I can talk you through it.

46:28.625 --> 46:29.665
Thank you.

46:32.385 --> 46:33.425
Go.

46:53.985 --> 46:55.625
RADIO: Question for DCI Sharma.

46:56.985 --> 46:58.225
Go ahead.

47:00.105 --> 47:01.985
Is Longcross talking yet?

47:04.065 --> 47:05.145
I don't know.

47:06.305 --> 47:09.865
It'd help, sir, if I knew
this hadn't all been in vain.

47:12.785 --> 47:15.583
We'll get back to you on that.
To me, Vicky.

47:15.585 --> 47:16.625
Thanks.

47:21.345 --> 47:22.985
I'll get an update on Longcross.

47:32.625 --> 47:34.503
We've got picture.

47:34.505 --> 47:36.985
Can you hear me?
Receiving.

47:40.145 --> 47:42.063
Get Vicky away.

47:42.065 --> 47:43.545
She shouldn't have to watch.

47:48.665 --> 47:49.705
Mrs Budd...

48:13.265 --> 48:15.503
I'm not going to manage
with one hand.

48:15.505 --> 48:18.663
We'll start by freeing
your left hand.

48:18.665 --> 48:20.145
You'll see a set of scissors.

48:24.305 --> 48:28.105
Use it to divide the tape over your
thumb, creating two loose ends.

48:51.825 --> 48:54.065
Next you'll see
a non-ferrous spacer.

48:55.865 --> 48:58.345
It looks like one of the pieces
in a game of draughts.

49:05.265 --> 49:07.423
Slip the spacer under your thumb,

49:07.425 --> 49:10.025
being sure to maintain pressure
on the DMS trigger.

49:21.545 --> 49:24.983
Being sure to maintain pressure,
roll your thumb through 90 degrees

49:24.985 --> 49:28.705
so you can fold one of the free ends
of tape down onto the spacer.

49:35.625 --> 49:39.143
The next stage is to roll your thumb
in the opposite direction,

49:39.145 --> 49:43.825
over the piece of tape you've just
secured, maintaining pressure...

49:49.025 --> 49:52.105
..so that you can fold the other
free end of tape to the spacer.

49:59.745 --> 50:02.623
If you're sure the tape is secure,

50:02.625 --> 50:04.705
you'll be able to remove your thumb.

50:18.545 --> 50:19.825
Well done, David.

50:21.265 --> 50:24.223
I'd suggest applying another
couple of loops of tape to get

50:24.225 --> 50:25.945
the spacer 100% secure.

50:36.305 --> 50:40.425
David, normally the best approach
is to neutralise the power source.

50:41.425 --> 50:43.983
But remember, with the 1/10 device,

50:43.985 --> 50:47.065
Fort Halstead found it was rigged
with multiple booby traps.

50:48.545 --> 50:51.945
When the power was cut, the control
unit triggered the detonators.

50:53.185 --> 50:55.505
I'm convinced this is
the same kind of device.

50:58.585 --> 51:01.745
Then you're going to have to
neutralise the control unit itself.

51:03.105 --> 51:05.943
I've already removed
the cover successfully,

51:05.945 --> 51:07.785
but there may be hidden trip wires.

51:11.985 --> 51:14.585
Thanks, mate,
that's giving us a good view.

51:16.625 --> 51:18.663
Now, what do you suggest?

51:18.665 --> 51:21.865
I doubt a device like this will be
neutralised by cutting a wire.

51:24.905 --> 51:26.623
A shunt might work.

51:26.625 --> 51:29.423
Hence the croc clips and cable?

51:29.425 --> 51:30.465
Yeah.

51:38.265 --> 51:41.985
I can see a pair of relay blocks
serving the detonators.

51:43.145 --> 51:44.905
I'm going to shunt between the two.

52:17.905 --> 52:20.385
Right, I'm going to disconnect
the power supply.

52:25.585 --> 52:27.465
I'm cutting the first wire.

52:51.265 --> 52:52.425
Oh...

52:58.985 --> 53:00.425
Put some tape over the ends.

53:05.185 --> 53:07.263
Question for DCI Sharma.

53:07.265 --> 53:08.623
Go ahead.

53:08.625 --> 53:10.145
Any news on Longcross?

53:18.425 --> 53:20.143
Sir?

53:20.145 --> 53:21.623
I'm very sorry, David.

53:21.625 --> 53:23.145
He had to be released.

53:24.425 --> 53:25.465
Is that it?

53:27.025 --> 53:29.065
They just get away with it
scot-free?

53:37.265 --> 53:39.823
I'm going to cut the second wire.

53:39.825 --> 53:42.743
Everyone should get
as far back as possible.

53:42.745 --> 53:44.705
<font color="cyan">Everyone back.
Take cover.</font> Fall back.

53:53.065 --> 53:55.663
<font color="yellow">Get everyone right back!
</font><font color="lime">Move back! Move back!</font>

53:55.665 --> 53:58.305
<font color="yellow">Get right back!
</font><font color="lime">All of you, move.</font>

54:04.145 --> 54:05.185
OK.

54:31.225 --> 54:33.065
After him!
Go! Go! Go!!

54:51.625 --> 54:53.983
No obs on Budd in the graveyard.

54:53.985 --> 54:56.263
Widen the search.
Lock off all surrounding roads.

54:56.265 --> 54:58.183
Negative, no obs.

54:58.185 --> 55:00.145
Negative. We lost him.

55:02.745 --> 55:04.063
Minister.

55:04.065 --> 55:05.105
Where's Budd?

55:06.305 --> 55:09.623
I'm afraid I don't have that
information at this time.

55:09.625 --> 55:10.905
What's he up to?

55:12.265 --> 55:15.903
In all probability,
he's fleeing from justice.

55:15.905 --> 55:17.305
And what if he's not?

55:52.785 --> 55:54.343
That'll kill you.

55:54.345 --> 55:55.385
Oh, my God!

55:57.545 --> 55:59.823
So would a suicide vest.

55:59.825 --> 56:01.383
Oh, my God. You're OK.

56:01.385 --> 56:02.785
Like you give a shit.

56:04.665 --> 56:07.423
I don't... I don't even know what
to say to you. I'm so sorry.

56:07.425 --> 56:10.543
Co-operate, you'll get immunity,
witness protection.

56:10.545 --> 56:14.063
You'll be out. <font color="lime">I can't do that.
</font>You're going to phone Luke.

56:14.065 --> 56:16.303
You're going to tell him the Inside
Man's going to talk.

56:16.305 --> 56:17.703
He's going to want to silence him.

56:17.705 --> 56:19.383
He's going to lead me straight
to him.

56:19.385 --> 56:21.663
Isn't Luke going to find that
a bit suspicious?

56:21.665 --> 56:23.185
It's what you did to me.

56:26.265 --> 56:28.305
It's the only way to prove
I'm innocent.

56:39.905 --> 56:40.945
I'll drive.

57:31.465 --> 57:32.505
Stay put.

57:57.825 --> 57:59.345
Are you off somewhere?

58:04.385 --> 58:06.183
None of your business.

58:06.185 --> 58:08.705
<font color="lime">Talking of which...
</font>I pay for results.

58:10.345 --> 58:12.183
Budd is still out there.

58:12.185 --> 58:13.503
It's a basic rule, Lorraine -

58:13.505 --> 58:16.143
if you're going to frame someone,
you make it the dead bloke.

58:16.145 --> 58:17.783
That's hardly my fault.

58:17.785 --> 58:19.865
No, but it's made you nervous.

58:28.785 --> 58:30.503
On your knees, hands on your head.

58:30.505 --> 58:32.185
Are you fucking joking?

58:34.225 --> 58:36.063
Stand down, Sarge, that's an order.

58:36.065 --> 58:37.425
I know about you, too.

58:39.625 --> 58:40.825
On your knees!

58:44.745 --> 58:45.785
Hands.

58:47.505 --> 58:48.585
Hands.

58:55.585 --> 58:56.705
Did you kill her?

58:59.985 --> 59:01.385
Did you kill Julia?

59:04.345 --> 59:05.943
David, don't do this.

59:05.945 --> 59:06.985
Tell me.

59:09.905 --> 59:11.065
It was business.

59:12.705 --> 59:13.983
David, don't!

59:13.985 --> 59:15.025
Why?

59:16.305 --> 59:18.463
Just good for business.

59:18.465 --> 59:20.105
It's nothing personal.

59:21.265 --> 59:22.745
Nothing personal.

59:23.825 --> 59:25.025
David, don't.

59:27.745 --> 59:30.023
Argh!

59:33.225 --> 59:34.505
Don't look at me.

59:42.625 --> 59:45.065
Call this in
before I change my mind.

59:49.385 --> 59:50.505
It's over.

01:00:03.865 --> 01:00:05.263
Chief Superintendent Craddock.

01:00:05.265 --> 01:00:08.465
I need a firearms unit to my home
address right away, please.

01:00:18.905 --> 01:00:21.825
We've got prints back on
your blank rounds.

01:00:23.745 --> 01:00:26.745
They match known associates
of Luke Aikens.

01:00:31.225 --> 01:00:33.185
Why didn't they just steal your gun?

01:00:34.625 --> 01:00:37.863
Straightaway I'd have known
they'd been in my flat.

01:00:37.865 --> 01:00:40.863
They were trying to frame me.

01:00:40.865 --> 01:00:42.783
Suppose they couldn't take the
chance

01:00:42.785 --> 01:00:44.385
of leaving me with live rounds.

01:00:50.305 --> 01:00:51.345
Cheers.

01:00:58.865 --> 01:01:00.065
Great work, mate.

01:01:06.385 --> 01:01:10.745
SO15 recorded interview with Chief
Superintendent Lorraine Craddock
by DCI Sharma.

01:01:14.025 --> 01:01:17.145
Describe the nature of your
relationship with Luke Aikens.

01:01:25.265 --> 01:01:26.785
For some years I've...

01:01:29.265 --> 01:01:32.545
..disclosed sensitive
information on...

01:01:34.705 --> 01:01:39.705
..on police operations that might
threaten his criminal activities.

01:01:41.425 --> 01:01:44.745
What information did you disclose
regarding the Home Secretary?

01:01:51.745 --> 01:01:57.465
Her itinerary the day of the
Thornton Circus attempt on her life.

01:01:59.065 --> 01:02:01.665
Which Aikens passed
to Andrew Apsted?

01:02:07.465 --> 01:02:09.105
Luke recruited Apsted.

01:02:13.985 --> 01:02:15.945
He armed him and...

01:02:19.865 --> 01:02:22.665
..used one of his
captive businesses to...

01:02:24.625 --> 01:02:28.943
..enable Apsted to access
Pascoe House as a tradesman.

01:02:28.945 --> 01:02:32.625
And the St Matthew's attack that
resulted in the Home Secretary's
death?

01:02:42.985 --> 01:02:44.025
Erm...

01:02:45.585 --> 01:02:46.865
Her itinerary.

01:02:48.545 --> 01:02:50.545
Her security plans and procedures.

01:02:56.385 --> 01:02:57.985
Luke was able to...

01:03:00.185 --> 01:03:03.145
..plan steps to overcome
all of them.

01:03:06.065 --> 01:03:09.905
What motivated Aikens to induce you
to disclose this information?

01:03:19.585 --> 01:03:23.743
Luke found out Julia Montague was
planning to transfer powers

01:03:23.745 --> 01:03:26.745
to the Security Service
which would give them...

01:03:29.465 --> 01:03:30.823
..an upper hand,

01:03:30.825 --> 01:03:33.185
more of an upper hand
against organised crime.

01:03:35.785 --> 01:03:38.625
They're harder to contact,
more shadowy, therefore...

01:03:46.665 --> 01:03:49.503
..harder to bribe and blackmail.

01:03:49.505 --> 01:03:52.225
Unlike corrupt officers
such as yourself.

01:03:56.185 --> 01:04:01.663
Aikens needed policing to stay with
an organisation he could manipulate.

01:04:01.665 --> 01:04:05.143
Is there any connection with you
appointing David Budd as the

01:04:05.145 --> 01:04:06.825
Home Secretary's PPO?

01:04:10.145 --> 01:04:12.223
Yes.

01:04:12.225 --> 01:04:14.385
So he'd make the perfect fall guy.

01:04:16.505 --> 01:04:18.703
And the Heath Bank attack.

01:04:18.705 --> 01:04:22.783
Did you provide the confidential
information on PS Budd's family?

01:04:22.785 --> 01:04:27.545
No, never, I'd never do anything
like that to one of my team.

01:04:29.625 --> 01:04:31.703
If she didn't do it, who did?

01:04:31.705 --> 01:04:35.703
Lorraine Craddock, I will now be
seeking the authority of the
Crown Prosecutor to charge you...

01:04:35.705 --> 01:04:37.863
There's one other person in this
whole conspiracy

01:04:37.865 --> 01:04:39.103
that knew about my kids.

01:04:39.105 --> 01:04:41.103
..malfeasance in a public office

01:04:41.105 --> 01:04:42.745
and conspiracy to murder.

01:04:44.825 --> 01:04:46.345
Interview terminated.

01:04:57.345 --> 01:04:59.743
NEWS: Ten days since the
assassination of Julia Montague,

01:04:59.745 --> 01:05:01.623
the Metropolitan Police

The Metropolitan Police
Counter Terrorism Branch, SO15,

Downing Street and the Home Office
have welcomed the police

01:05:11.905 --> 01:05:15.623
breakthrough in investigating the
Home Secretary's assassination.

01:05:15.625 --> 01:05:19.305
A Home Office spokesman said it was
too early to make any further
comment.

01:05:24.745 --> 01:05:26.463
David.

01:05:26.465 --> 01:05:27.505
Good to go.

01:05:32.585 --> 01:05:34.065
The DIR is recording.

01:05:41.465 --> 01:05:42.505
Nadia.

01:05:44.065 --> 01:05:46.505
I'd like to start by asking
you about David Budd.

01:05:50.385 --> 01:05:53.105
Did you have any information
regarding his children?

01:05:54.665 --> 01:05:55.705
No.

01:05:57.065 --> 01:05:58.423
Why are you asking me this?

01:05:58.425 --> 01:06:01.545
Nadia, we've had significant
breakthroughs in our inquiry.

01:06:03.465 --> 01:06:06.503
There's only one piece of
the puzzle left.

01:06:06.505 --> 01:06:07.825
And that's you.

01:06:09.905 --> 01:06:12.705
And maybe you're just an innocent
victim in all of this.

01:06:14.985 --> 01:06:17.665
The pawn controlled
by the real masterminds.

01:06:19.185 --> 01:06:20.745
You can say, "No comment."

01:06:32.425 --> 01:06:34.785
Is that true? Are you just a victim?

01:06:52.865 --> 01:06:55.145
David Budd made the same mistake.

01:06:56.705 --> 01:06:59.663
He thought so little of me,
he showed me pictures.

01:06:59.665 --> 01:07:03.023
What do you mean,
"Thought so little of you"?

01:07:03.025 --> 01:07:04.705
To him, I was a weak woman.

01:07:06.985 --> 01:07:10.343
I remembered everything he told me
about his children.

01:07:10.345 --> 01:07:11.463
Their names.

01:07:11.465 --> 01:07:12.983
Their ages.

01:07:12.985 --> 01:07:15.663
From prison, I was able to
inform my organisation.

01:07:15.665 --> 01:07:18.663
So they could launch an attack on
his children's school?

01:07:18.665 --> 01:07:19.705
Yes.

01:07:22.425 --> 01:07:25.105
There's another finding
I'd like to put to you.

01:07:26.585 --> 01:07:29.383
We've been able to examine the
Person-Borne Improvised

01:07:29.385 --> 01:07:32.105
Explosive Device David Budd
was forced to wear.

01:07:33.585 --> 01:07:36.663
Forensic examination of the control
unit circuitry detected

01:07:36.665 --> 01:07:40.145
deposits of your DNA
and your fingerprints.

01:07:42.585 --> 01:07:43.905
Why would that be?

01:07:48.785 --> 01:07:50.665
Because I built the device.

01:07:55.545 --> 01:07:57.025
I built all the bombs.

01:07:58.945 --> 01:08:02.185
You all saw me as a poor,
oppressed Muslim woman.

01:08:03.585 --> 01:08:04.985
I am an engineer.

01:08:06.105 --> 01:08:07.305
I am a Jihadi.

01:08:08.745 --> 01:08:09.785
Which bombs?

01:08:12.985 --> 01:08:15.943
The one used to kill
the Home Secretary,

01:08:15.945 --> 01:08:20.183
the one used to kill police officers
at Heath Bank School,

01:08:20.185 --> 01:08:22.345
the one I wore on
the 1st of October.

01:08:24.345 --> 01:08:28.944
So you're telling us this man didn't
supply the bomb to your husband?

01:08:33.385 --> 01:08:37.063
I invented that story because
Police Sergeant Budd was so eager to

01:08:37.064 --> 01:08:38.743
believe it.

01:08:38.745 --> 01:08:41.223
And so stupidly eager to believe me.

01:08:41.225 --> 01:08:43.983
You made that up to
mislead our inquiry?

01:08:43.984 --> 01:08:47.582
How easy that was.
You are all so easy...

01:08:47.585 --> 01:08:51.024
It wasn't just you, mate,
we all fell for it.

01:08:54.104 --> 01:08:57.465
Who planted the device
at St Matthew's College?

01:08:59.625 --> 01:09:01.705
The one that killed
the Home Secretary.

01:09:03.745 --> 01:09:04.904
Non-believers.

01:09:05.904 --> 01:09:06.944
Criminals.

01:09:08.545 --> 01:09:09.585
Luke Aikens?

01:09:10.665 --> 01:09:11.705
Yes.

01:09:13.425 --> 01:09:16.383
Why did you conspire
with non-believers?

01:09:16.385 --> 01:09:18.103
For money.

01:09:18.104 --> 01:09:21.863
Money to build more bombs and buy
more guns and spread the

01:09:21.865 --> 01:09:24.423
truth to our brothers and sisters
throughout the world.

01:09:24.425 --> 01:09:26.783
So that the world could be convinced
that we had put a sword

01:09:26.785 --> 01:09:28.703
through the heart of the
British Government.

01:09:28.705 --> 01:09:32.984
You failed to detonate your own
PBIED on the October 1st rail
attack.

01:09:34.585 --> 01:09:36.903
You couldn't go through with it.

01:09:36.904 --> 01:09:38.585
But look how I have atoned.

01:09:39.705 --> 01:09:42.785
I have helped the cause
a thousand times more.

01:09:48.225 --> 01:09:50.662
Sophie, we are being told
that a statement by the

01:09:50.665 --> 01:09:52.542
Prime Minister is imminent.

01:09:52.545 --> 01:09:55.463
Meanwhile, all day, ministers have
been giving their reactions

01:09:55.465 --> 01:09:58.143
to this morning's news that the
Prime Minister cancelled

01:09:58.145 --> 01:09:59.583
today's engagements.

01:09:59.585 --> 01:10:02.103
Home Secretary,
any reaction on the breaking news?

01:10:02.105 --> 01:10:05.343
Really, please, we should avoid
speculation until the

01:10:05.345 --> 01:10:08.583
Prime Minister's had the opportunity
to address the allegations himself.

01:10:08.585 --> 01:10:11.143
Yes. Come in.

01:10:11.145 --> 01:10:14.063
Just to remind you, today's events
follow unconfirmed reports of a leak

01:10:14.065 --> 01:10:18.223
of compromising material relating to
the Prime Minister's past.

01:10:18.225 --> 01:10:21.023
Is the Prime Minister going
to resign?

01:10:21.025 --> 01:10:24.985
I'm just getting on with the job
of protecting our country.

01:10:25.985 --> 01:10:29.663
Thank you.
Home Secretary? Home Secretary?

01:10:29.665 --> 01:10:32.303
It's also being reported that the
leak implicates the

01:10:32.305 --> 01:10:37.463
Director General of the Security
Service, Stephen Hunter-Dunn...

01:10:37.465 --> 01:10:40.943
The Prime Minister will resign
before the day is out.

01:10:40.945 --> 01:10:43.183
Hunter-Dunn the same.

01:10:43.185 --> 01:10:47.263
Mike Travis, he stays on to make
sure RIPA-18 gets kicked into

01:10:47.265 --> 01:10:48.345
the long grass.

01:10:49.305 --> 01:10:51.543
Leaking the kompromat.

01:10:51.545 --> 01:10:53.265
Whose decision was that?

01:10:57.825 --> 01:10:59.545
I couldn't possibly say.

01:11:04.625 --> 01:11:08.943
Thanks to you, David, the CPS have
charged Nadia Ali, Luke Aikens

01:11:08.945 --> 01:11:13.903
and Lorraine Craddock in the
Conspiracy to Murder Julia Montague.

01:11:13.905 --> 01:11:16.663
Some say you should get a medal.

01:11:16.665 --> 01:11:20.103
Others reckon you should be
kicked off the Force.

01:11:20.105 --> 01:11:22.103
We'll see.

01:11:22.105 --> 01:11:26.223
There'll need to be a thorough
investigation into your conduct.

01:11:26.225 --> 01:11:30.665
But first, David, there's something
you need more than all of that.

01:11:34.985 --> 01:11:36.025
Come in.

01:11:40.305 --> 01:11:41.465
<font color="lime">Hello.</font> Hello.

01:11:48.865 --> 01:11:49.985
I am David.

01:11:54.225 --> 01:11:55.505
And I...

01:11:59.305 --> 01:12:00.745
I need some help.

01:12:24.825 --> 01:12:26.145
Hi. Hey.

01:12:27.865 --> 01:12:28.905
Come in.

01:12:32.865 --> 01:12:34.383
How are you doing?

01:12:34.385 --> 01:12:36.223
I'm good.

01:12:36.225 --> 01:12:37.265
How are you?

01:12:39.185 --> 01:12:41.303
I'm getting there.

01:12:41.305 --> 01:12:43.585
Well, you've taken the first step.

01:12:44.625 --> 01:12:46.225
I'm really proud of you.

01:12:49.705 --> 01:12:52.703
Yeah. The kids are looking forward
to sleeping in their own beds again.

01:12:52.705 --> 01:12:54.543
I bet.

01:12:54.545 --> 01:12:56.543
I was thinking,

01:12:56.545 --> 01:12:59.945
it's actually my turn for them again
but only if that's OK with you.

01:13:01.225 --> 01:13:02.265
Yeah.

01:13:03.465 --> 01:13:05.303
Kids, your dad's here.

01:13:05.305 --> 01:13:06.383
Dad.

01:13:06.385 --> 01:13:08.423
No train journeys this time.

01:13:08.425 --> 01:13:10.745
<font color="yellow">Dad.
</font><font color="lime">Hello, princess.</font>

01:13:12.625 --> 01:13:15.943
There's a monster on my back.
Get him off, get him off!

01:13:15.945 --> 01:13:18.225
OK. You behave.
You have fun.

01:13:27.505 --> 01:13:28.705
D'you...

01:13:30.905 --> 01:13:32.583
What?

01:13:32.585 --> 01:13:33.625
Nothing.

01:13:35.825 --> 01:13:36.865
There's...

01:13:38.425 --> 01:13:39.785
There's room for one more.

01:13:42.265 --> 01:13:43.943
Yeah?

01:13:43.945 --> 01:13:44.985
Yeah.

01:13:47.065 --> 01:13:48.983
OK.

01:13:48.985 --> 01:13:50.145
I'll get my bag.

01:13:57.065 --> 01:13:58.623
Mummy's going to come, too.

01:13:58.625 --> 01:13:59.985
Yeah!

01:14:09.025 --> 01:14:10.145
Ease up.

01:14:12.025 --> 01:14:13.223
OK.

01:14:13.225 --> 01:14:15.225
Everyone in? Good, let's go.
