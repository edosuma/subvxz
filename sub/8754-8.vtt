00:12.334 --> 00:15.168
She's losing blood...

00:15.170 --> 00:16.169
We're terrified.

00:16.171 --> 00:17.503
I don't even want to come home.

00:17.505 --> 00:18.872
He would kill people.

00:18.874 --> 00:21.291
They found a mutilated body
with a large amount of blood.

00:21.293 --> 00:23.509
Her neck got broken.

00:23.511 --> 00:24.878
I can't protect my kids.

00:24.880 --> 00:26.512
They don't have answers.

00:26.514 --> 00:29.816
People crawling on the floor towards them.

00:29.818 --> 00:32.552
It's bad in here.

00:32.554 --> 00:34.988
Something bad's going to happen.

00:34.990 --> 00:37.257
My name is Amy Allan.

00:37.259 --> 00:39.025
There's panic.

00:39.027 --> 00:40.460
And it's almost like a butchering.

00:40.462 --> 00:41.527
I see dead people.

00:41.529 --> 00:43.663
They all died horribly.

00:43.665 --> 00:45.365
I speak to dead people.

00:45.367 --> 00:46.766
Get out of here.

00:46.768 --> 00:48.401
And they speak to me.

00:48.403 --> 00:50.436
Vicious.

00:50.438 --> 00:53.573
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

00:53.575 --> 00:55.275
It doesn't matter where you are.
I'll find you.

00:55.277 --> 00:56.843
I rely on my partner.

00:56.845 --> 00:58.478
I'm Steve Di Schiavi.

00:58.480 --> 01:00.380
I'm a retired New York
City homicide detective.

01:00.382 --> 01:02.081
This guy's a real piece of work.

01:02.083 --> 01:05.752
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

01:05.754 --> 01:07.253
I feel like I live in a house of Hell.

01:07.255 --> 01:08.421
It's my job to reveal them.

01:08.423 --> 01:10.690
This is not good.

01:10.692 --> 01:12.425
But Steve and I never speak...

01:12.427 --> 01:14.460
We never communicate
during an investigation.

01:14.462 --> 01:16.229
Until the very end...

01:16.231 --> 01:17.697
I want my life back.

01:17.699 --> 01:19.899
When we uncover if it's
safe for you to stay...

01:19.901 --> 01:21.701
Is he trying to kill her?

01:21.703 --> 01:22.969
Or time to get out.

01:22.971 --> 01:24.470
Oh, my God.

01:24.472 --> 01:26.172
This is going to kill us.

01:42.190 --> 01:43.473
I'm in Struthers, Ohio.

01:43.475 --> 01:46.125
It's a small city right next to Youngstown.

01:46.127 --> 01:49.696
I got called by a woman who
sounded desperate and alone.

01:49.698 --> 01:50.897
She said something in the house

01:50.899 --> 01:53.900
is attacking her and her two kids.

01:53.902 --> 01:56.352
Making matters worse,
her husband doesn't believe her.

01:56.354 --> 01:58.871
She told me she's got
no place else to turn.

02:11.186 --> 02:13.353
Before Amy arrives,

02:13.355 --> 02:16.622
I need to make sure the home
is clear of any personal items

02:16.624 --> 02:21.260
or family photographs that
may influence her findings.

02:21.262 --> 02:23.129
When I'm finished,

02:23.131 --> 02:25.548
the location will be
ready for tonight's walk.

02:36.361 --> 02:42.982
Right away,
I'm seeing a few mutilated people.

02:42.984 --> 02:45.018
They are chopped up.

02:45.020 --> 02:50.256
And there's pieces of a
person coming together,

02:50.258 --> 02:52.625
and they form a woman.

02:52.627 --> 02:58.498
And she is, like, begging to make it stop.

02:58.500 --> 03:01.167
Then, a male comes up.

03:01.169 --> 03:04.170
He's very well spoken, uh, educated.

03:04.172 --> 03:07.173
- I think he was a doctor.
- Okay.

03:07.175 --> 03:09.342
But he says that when he was alive,

03:09.344 --> 03:11.844
he did do some things that were wrong.

03:11.846 --> 03:13.846
And he had a very interesting,

03:13.848 --> 03:17.100
I thought, reaction to the mutilated chick.

03:17.102 --> 03:19.152
He was, like, "Ah."

03:21.289 --> 03:23.489
I don't know what the
[bleep] happened to them.

03:30.698 --> 03:32.532
So Joan,
after I talked to you on the phone,

03:32.534 --> 03:35.268
I wanted to get here as soon as I could.

03:35.270 --> 03:37.203
You sound like you're going through hell.

03:37.205 --> 03:39.439
I'm just very grateful
that you guys are here.

03:39.441 --> 03:42.875
We are living in a nightmare.

03:42.877 --> 03:45.111
First, we started hearing noises.

03:45.113 --> 03:47.947
Then, it went to things moving

03:47.949 --> 03:50.316
to seeing shadow figures.

03:50.318 --> 03:53.453
Then, it started getting physical.

03:53.455 --> 03:54.570
Geez.

03:54.572 --> 03:55.621
What year did you guys move in here?

03:55.623 --> 03:56.823
2005.

03:56.825 --> 04:00.042
You live here with...

04:00.044 --> 04:03.546
My son Dalton, my husband John,

04:03.548 --> 04:06.282
and my daughter Delani.

04:06.284 --> 04:10.970
When it gets to the point
where I can't protect my kids,

04:10.972 --> 04:12.989
that's where I draw the line.

04:12.991 --> 04:14.657
You look like a happy family in this photo.

04:14.659 --> 04:17.310
- No.
- Okay.

04:17.312 --> 04:18.761
We're not happy now.

04:18.762 --> 04:21.380
- There's been no support.
- In what sense?

04:21.382 --> 04:25.118
My husband not believing me,
not believing my daughter,

04:25.120 --> 04:26.819
not believing my son.

04:26.821 --> 04:29.989
It's tearing the marriage apart.

04:29.991 --> 04:32.875
So it's you and the kids against
whatever is in this house,

04:32.877 --> 04:34.293
and your husband is out in left field

04:34.295 --> 04:36.129
- somewhere with this whole thing?
- Mm-hmm.

04:36.131 --> 04:38.931
Dalton was scratched on
the back of his neck.

04:38.933 --> 04:42.001
Delani was scratched on her back.

04:42.003 --> 04:46.022
I was pushed going down
to the basement one day.

04:46.024 --> 04:48.391
And I do know the elderly woman

04:48.393 --> 04:49.992
that lived here before we did,

04:49.994 --> 04:52.411
they found her at the bottom
of the basement stairs.

04:52.413 --> 04:54.147
Really? Was she dead?

04:54.149 --> 04:57.033
- She died a couple days later.
- Okay.

04:57.035 --> 04:59.018
It's taken a toll on my health.

04:59.020 --> 05:04.924
I've been in the hospital
six times due to rib pain.

05:04.926 --> 05:07.760
It feels like somebody is squeezing me.

05:07.762 --> 05:09.595
What... what makes you
think this is paranormal

05:09.597 --> 05:11.797
- and not just...
- The doctors are baffled.

05:11.799 --> 05:17.036
They've done bone scans,
CAT scans, MRis, X-rays.

05:17.038 --> 05:18.488
You name it, they've done it.

05:18.490 --> 05:19.922
Okay, that's interesting.

05:19.924 --> 05:23.125
I want to know who is here,
why they're here,

05:23.127 --> 05:24.877
and I want them out.

05:28.917 --> 05:31.817
I keep getting this wave of illness.

05:31.819 --> 05:35.288
Uh, and it is very much in the stomach.

05:35.290 --> 05:37.473
Uh, very nauseous.

05:37.475 --> 05:41.027
It's almost like being
punched in the stomach.

05:44.532 --> 05:46.098
Ugh. Geez, man.

05:46.100 --> 05:50.803
There's a lot of stress in here.

05:50.805 --> 05:53.339
Yuck, yuck, yuck.

05:53.341 --> 05:55.841
The doctor, he didn't want to come in.

05:55.843 --> 05:57.443
Aw, geez.

05:57.445 --> 05:59.612
He's like,
"I shouldn't even be here anymore."

05:59.614 --> 06:02.448
He's like, "Ah,
let's just get this over with."

06:10.141 --> 06:12.325
- Okay. So, Joan, you sleep down here?
- Right.

06:12.327 --> 06:14.860
- But it's unfinished, obviously.
- Correct.

06:14.862 --> 06:16.829
And I'm assuming this is
also where you got pushed?

06:16.831 --> 06:18.014
Yep.

06:18.016 --> 06:20.700
I was coming down the stairs one day.

06:20.702 --> 06:23.836
I got to the third step.

06:23.838 --> 06:26.339
Felt a push on my back

06:26.341 --> 06:30.142
and just crashed right
into this wall right here.

06:32.547 --> 06:34.213
Did you have any laundry
or anything like that?

06:34.215 --> 06:35.531
No.

06:35.533 --> 06:36.866
So you couldn't have missed
a step by not seeing it.

06:36.868 --> 06:37.984
No.

06:37.986 --> 06:39.201
Okay. Did you tell your husband?

06:39.203 --> 06:41.671
- No.
- Why?

06:41.673 --> 06:44.090
I didn't think he would believe me.

06:44.092 --> 06:45.491
Now, you told me the previous owner

06:45.493 --> 06:48.261
fell down the flight of stairs,
and they found her here.

06:48.263 --> 06:49.495
Right.

06:49.497 --> 06:50.763
You think that's a coincidence?

06:50.765 --> 06:52.031
I don't know.

06:52.033 --> 06:53.516
Okay.

06:53.518 --> 06:54.700
So, is that the only thing

06:54.702 --> 06:56.636
- that's happened to you down here?
- No.

06:56.638 --> 07:00.006
I was laying in bed one night.

07:00.008 --> 07:02.074
All of a sudden, the rib pain.

07:02.076 --> 07:04.710
I open my eyes, and over here,

07:04.712 --> 07:07.613
there's three shadow people.

07:07.615 --> 07:11.684
And they're leaning over like this,
just looking at me.

07:11.686 --> 07:13.452
Were you sleeping, and then got awaken...

07:14.555 --> 07:17.456
Oh, honey, I'm sorry. You okay?

07:17.458 --> 07:18.541
I'm sorry.

07:18.543 --> 07:19.659
No, no, no. Come here.

07:19.661 --> 07:22.528
It's all right. It's all right.

07:22.530 --> 07:23.929
I'm here. I believe you.

07:23.931 --> 07:25.665
Okay?

07:25.667 --> 07:29.135
It was the worst feeling in the world.

07:29.137 --> 07:31.270
I couldn't sit up. I couldn't move.

07:31.272 --> 07:33.089
I couldn't talk.

07:33.091 --> 07:38.110
10 seconds later, it was just,
like, phew, they were gone.

07:38.112 --> 07:40.946
Scariest thing I've ever encountered.

07:42.166 --> 07:43.649
Okay.

07:50.725 --> 07:53.442
Oh, my.

07:53.444 --> 07:57.029
So now I'm seeing there's this dead female

07:57.031 --> 07:59.065
and a living lady.

07:59.067 --> 08:04.837
Dead lady, living lady have
some kind of attachment.

08:04.839 --> 08:06.372
Interesting.

08:06.374 --> 08:07.707
What?

08:08.509 --> 08:12.611
So the dead lady is trying
to jump the living lady,

08:12.613 --> 08:15.147
but the dead lady doesn't
know what she's doing.

08:15.149 --> 08:16.916
So when she tries,

08:16.918 --> 08:21.320
she kind of [bleep] up
the living woman's body.

08:21.322 --> 08:25.858
Makes the living lady sick.

08:25.860 --> 08:29.895
Like, cellular problems.

08:32.767 --> 08:37.303
The living lady has experiences

08:37.304 --> 08:40.506
when the dead lady is trying to jump her.

08:40.508 --> 08:44.810
That's when she sees the
other [bleep] dead people.

08:44.812 --> 08:48.514
I see, like, a person sitting up in bed

08:48.516 --> 08:51.951
looking down this way and seeing,

08:51.953 --> 08:55.254
like,
people crawling on the floor towards them.

09:01.612 --> 09:04.630
And it's all the mutilated people.

09:04.632 --> 09:07.066
Can't breathe, freaking out.

09:30.733 --> 09:33.100
So, John, I was talking to
your wife about the things

09:33.102 --> 09:35.369
that are going on here
and why she called us in.

09:35.371 --> 09:36.687
It's got me concerned.

09:36.689 --> 09:38.606
You guys have a pretty bad situation.

09:38.608 --> 09:41.075
She seems to think that
you're not supportive

09:41.077 --> 09:43.427
of what her and the kids are going through.

09:43.429 --> 09:48.549
I believe them, but I don't have answers.

09:48.551 --> 09:51.535
Have you had any experiences
at all that you can't explain?

09:51.537 --> 09:54.121
There's one I know of that, you know,

09:54.123 --> 09:57.024
Joan and I just kind of
didn't see eye-to-eye on.

09:57.026 --> 09:58.788
It took place down in the basement.

09:58.888 --> 09:59.964
Okay.

10:00.287 --> 10:04.923
And as we were speaking,
I seen this glare kind of like...

10:04.925 --> 10:08.059
kind of swoosh and went this
way up towards the wall.

10:08.061 --> 10:10.278
What did Joan think she saw?

10:10.280 --> 10:13.798
She thinks she saw something paranormal.

10:13.800 --> 10:15.834
So, what do you think you saw?

10:15.836 --> 10:18.169
I feel it was a glare off of a car

10:18.171 --> 10:20.839
and a glass block of where I was standing.

10:20.841 --> 10:22.374
Okay.

10:22.376 --> 10:24.175
So, you see where the problem is here

10:24.177 --> 10:25.360
between you and your wife?

10:25.362 --> 10:28.179
Yeah. It causes tension.

10:28.181 --> 10:30.348
I... I don't deny it one bit.

10:30.350 --> 10:33.017
Are you trying to not
accept what's going on here?

10:33.019 --> 10:34.686
No, I've tried.

10:34.688 --> 10:37.188
Um, there's times where
nobody has been home.

10:37.190 --> 10:41.776
I've just sat in the living room,
you know, nothing on,

10:41.778 --> 10:43.962
everything off, just sat.

10:43.964 --> 10:48.349
Waited for a noise, a boom, anything.

10:48.351 --> 10:50.735
I wish something would happen.

10:53.340 --> 10:56.841
Because dead lady
all about taking over.

10:56.843 --> 11:00.111
You know, she wants a... a life back.

11:00.113 --> 11:02.731
So this is why she's trying
to jump the living woman

11:02.733 --> 11:04.416
who is here.

11:04.418 --> 11:07.285
What would happen if she managed
to jump the living woman?

11:07.287 --> 11:10.755
She would take over the
living woman's body,

11:10.757 --> 11:15.260
and she would use it so
she could live again.

11:15.262 --> 11:20.098
She would probably do
very bad things to men.

11:20.100 --> 11:22.383
Do you have any idea
what she would do to men

11:22.385 --> 11:24.502
if she managed to pull this off?

11:24.504 --> 11:31.159
I think either she would torture
them or try to ruin their lives,

11:31.161 --> 11:33.745
or possibly try to kill them.

11:40.587 --> 11:41.753
So, Delani, uh,

11:41.755 --> 11:43.254
- I talked to Mom today.
- Mm-hmm.

11:43.256 --> 11:46.691
And she told me about what
you guys are going through.

11:46.693 --> 11:48.393
You're having a tough time, aren't you?

11:48.395 --> 11:50.612
Mm-hmm.

11:50.614 --> 11:54.149
It makes me really depressed.

11:54.151 --> 11:56.734
- Like, the whole situation.
- Okay.

11:56.736 --> 11:59.370
It'll make me cry a lot.

11:59.372 --> 12:03.274
But I just don't tell anyone.

12:03.276 --> 12:05.493
So, what kind of things
have you experienced?

12:05.495 --> 12:06.928
When I lay in bed at night,

12:06.930 --> 12:12.600
I see a shadow figure stand
outside my bedroom doorway.

12:12.602 --> 12:13.968
Okay. Can you describe it to me?

12:13.970 --> 12:17.222
It's tall, and it's very dark.

12:17.224 --> 12:20.758
I can't see any facial
features or anything.

12:20.760 --> 12:22.227
It's just black.

12:22.229 --> 12:24.479
- Is it shaped like a person?
- Mm-hmm.

12:24.481 --> 12:26.564
Would you say it's a man or a woman?

12:26.566 --> 12:31.035
I'd say a man because
it's larger than a woman.

12:31.037 --> 12:33.104
Do you feel that this thing
is threatening, or...

12:33.106 --> 12:35.139
I think it's trying to scare me.

12:35.141 --> 12:36.975
Are you frightened to the point

12:36.977 --> 12:38.743
you think it's gonna hurt you?

12:38.745 --> 12:39.944
Yes.

12:39.946 --> 12:41.846
So, honey, is there anything else going on?

12:41.848 --> 12:45.884
I've had scratches on my lower back.

12:45.886 --> 12:47.852
And can you describe the scratches for me?

12:47.854 --> 12:50.889
Um, it was three scratches.

12:50.891 --> 12:54.692
Like, a diagonal.

12:54.694 --> 12:56.461
This one right here.

13:00.300 --> 13:02.000
How did you notice that
the scratches were there?

13:02.002 --> 13:03.034
Did you feel them, or...

13:03.036 --> 13:04.335
Um, I went to sit down,

13:04.337 --> 13:07.005
and it started burning.

13:07.007 --> 13:10.675
Sometimes, I don't even want to come home.

13:10.677 --> 13:12.794
It's scary here.

13:18.485 --> 13:20.785
Oh.

13:20.787 --> 13:25.423
The doctor guy likes it in here.

13:25.425 --> 13:27.225
But to him, it's different.

13:27.227 --> 13:30.678
It's more like an office.

13:30.680 --> 13:33.765
He gets very angry when
people come in here.

13:36.369 --> 13:41.389
I think that they see him
as a very tall darkness.

13:41.391 --> 13:45.577
I don't like how he feels in here.

13:45.579 --> 13:47.345
Uh. Oh.

13:49.883 --> 13:53.251
This is a mess. This is so messed up.

14:08.111 --> 14:10.628
Joan told me that the
previous owner of her house

14:10.630 --> 14:13.832
died after falling down a flight of stairs.

14:13.834 --> 14:16.918
I made some calls, and
the story checks out.

14:16.920 --> 14:18.920
I managed to track down
the victim's nephew,

14:18.922 --> 14:20.755
and he said that wasn't the only tragedy

14:20.757 --> 14:22.841
that his aunt suffered
while she lived there.

14:28.315 --> 14:29.981
Mary was my aunt.

14:29.983 --> 14:33.351
Uh, she married my uncle Nick.

14:33.353 --> 14:35.620
They got married in 1937,

14:35.622 --> 14:39.024
and here's a picture of their honeymoon.

14:39.026 --> 14:41.109
Okay. So now, how did they wind up

14:41.111 --> 14:43.695
on the property that
I'm investigating now?

14:43.697 --> 14:46.231
- 1943, they bought the property.
- Okay.

14:46.233 --> 14:47.932
And they lived there...

14:47.934 --> 14:49.634
- Forever.
- Okay.

14:49.636 --> 14:52.537
Until they passed away, yes.

14:52.539 --> 14:55.540
Before we get to your aunt
Mary's accident in the house,

14:55.542 --> 14:57.142
you mentioned that she
had some other tragedy.

14:57.144 --> 14:58.209
What... what were you talking about?

14:58.211 --> 15:00.178
Yes, uh, she lost her youngest son

15:00.180 --> 15:01.963
which was, uh, Nick, Jr.

15:01.965 --> 15:03.314
He was 35 years old.

15:03.316 --> 15:05.250
He was killed in a motorcycle accident.

15:05.252 --> 15:07.519
He was... he hit a guard rail.

15:07.521 --> 15:10.522
And, uh, he was decapitated.

15:10.524 --> 15:11.689
Geez. When did this happen?

15:11.691 --> 15:14.692
Uh, it happened in 1973.

15:14.694 --> 15:16.828
Can we talk about your aunt's accident?

15:16.830 --> 15:17.912
Ah, yes.

15:17.914 --> 15:19.931
My aunt was 95 years old.

15:19.933 --> 15:22.534
- It happened in 2003.
- Okay.

15:22.536 --> 15:25.570
My uncle Nick had already
passed away in 2001.

15:25.572 --> 15:29.340
But she was alone,
living in the house by herself.

15:29.342 --> 15:32.077
Apparently, she fell
down the basement step.

15:32.079 --> 15:36.114
She laid there for three days,
uh, just barely alive.

15:36.116 --> 15:39.584
The mailman noticed that
the mail was backing up,

15:39.586 --> 15:41.586
and the neighbors would knock on the door.

15:41.588 --> 15:44.072
So eventually, they called the police,
and they came in.

15:44.074 --> 15:46.691
And when they got into the house,

15:46.693 --> 15:48.710
they found her at the foot of the steps

15:48.712 --> 15:50.295
in the basement barely alive.

15:50.297 --> 15:54.165
Here is her obituary.

15:54.167 --> 15:57.202
So this poor woman basically
laid there for three days.

15:57.204 --> 15:59.387
Yes. One or two days after that,

15:59.389 --> 16:00.972
she had passed away,

16:00.974 --> 16:04.142
probably from her injuries from the fall.

16:07.481 --> 16:09.364
What the hell?

16:09.366 --> 16:17.188
I'm seeing a thing that looks
like a half-man, half-wolf.

16:20.026 --> 16:23.311
It's growling. Grrr.

16:23.313 --> 16:26.131
It doesn't seem human.

16:29.903 --> 16:33.671
Um, it does something to the human body

16:33.673 --> 16:35.140
when it's around.

16:35.142 --> 16:39.777
It almost makes you lose your footing.

16:39.779 --> 16:41.146
So it almost, like,

16:41.148 --> 16:45.984
debilitates a person, makes you dizzy.

16:45.986 --> 16:49.721
Fall down... likes to make you fall down.

16:49.723 --> 16:52.590
And then, it does something to the heart

16:52.592 --> 16:59.497
so it can take this energy
from the human heart.

16:59.499 --> 17:02.367
So you feel very, very weak.

17:02.369 --> 17:05.136
But its intention is not to kill.

17:05.137 --> 17:09.174
Um, it likes to keep, like, a stash.

17:11.678 --> 17:14.646
So far,
I've got a family living in fear

17:14.647 --> 17:17.781
and a previous owner that died
after falling down the stairs.

17:17.784 --> 17:19.317
But I still need to see
if there's anything else

17:19.319 --> 17:21.819
that can help my case.

17:21.820 --> 17:24.821
Searching through old records,
I find Thomas Struthers,

17:24.824 --> 17:27.992
who is one of the original
owners of Joan's property.

17:27.993 --> 17:30.395
Turns out he suffered a
lot in his time there,

17:30.397 --> 17:33.231
losing not one but two adult children.

17:35.435 --> 17:37.335
I'm on my way to meet
with a local historian

17:37.337 --> 17:39.254
who promised to look into it for me.

17:44.644 --> 17:46.711
This guy, Thomas Struthers,

17:46.713 --> 17:49.080
what's his connection with the
property I'm investigating?

17:49.082 --> 17:52.367
Well, he was born on your
client's property in 1803,

17:52.369 --> 17:54.702
and his father was Captain John Struthers,

17:54.704 --> 17:56.287
the founder of the city.

17:56.289 --> 17:59.023
And then, when he turned 17 in 1820,

17:59.025 --> 18:01.743
he went to college, became an attorney.

18:01.745 --> 18:05.430
And in 1831 he got married to Eunice Eddy.

18:05.432 --> 18:07.232
Okay, so now, I know from the research

18:07.234 --> 18:08.833
I did that he lost two adult kids.

18:08.835 --> 18:10.635
- Yes, he did.
- What was the story with that?

18:10.637 --> 18:12.704
Here is the family portrait.

18:14.424 --> 18:16.107
That's Thomas and Eunice.

18:16.109 --> 18:18.359
And then, this is Thomas, Jr.,

18:18.361 --> 18:19.894
and that's Anna.

18:19.896 --> 18:21.813
In 1871, Thomas, Jr.

18:21.815 --> 18:25.750
Contracted typhoid fever at the age of 27.

18:25.752 --> 18:28.002
He was having dinner that night,

18:28.004 --> 18:29.654
said he didn't feel well.

18:29.656 --> 18:31.756
And by 4:00 a.m., he was dead.

18:31.758 --> 18:33.391
What a shame. Okay.

18:33.393 --> 18:34.592
So now, what about Anna's death?

18:34.594 --> 18:38.296
In 1880, she ended up getting severely ill.

18:38.298 --> 18:41.032
She dies of what they call consumption,

18:41.034 --> 18:44.135
and she was 32 years old.

18:44.137 --> 18:46.371
Okay. So, when does Thomas die?

18:46.373 --> 18:50.041
Thomas dies in the year of 1892.

18:50.043 --> 18:52.260
He was 89 years old.

18:55.348 --> 19:00.485
The doctor guy, he's very dramatic.

19:00.487 --> 19:07.191
How... how he expresses
himself is direct and honest.

19:07.193 --> 19:12.530
I think he is a perfectionist.

19:12.532 --> 19:16.434
I think he died from a heart attack.

19:16.436 --> 19:19.871
So there's something a little weird.

19:19.873 --> 19:23.558
So the doctor guy is talking about Ed Gein,

19:23.560 --> 19:26.811
who was a serial killer.

19:26.813 --> 19:28.246
And I think when his mom died,

19:28.248 --> 19:30.581
that's when he went crazy.

19:34.154 --> 19:36.888
And he... he would kill people,
and he would, like,

19:36.890 --> 19:39.557
use their skin to make [bleep] stuff.

19:39.559 --> 19:45.213
There's something with this,
and it's really agitating me.

20:03.410 --> 20:05.960
During my research,
one other thing caught my attention...

20:05.962 --> 20:08.796
Three chopped-up bodies
found in rail road box cars.

20:08.798 --> 20:11.499
And the train's last stop

20:11.501 --> 20:14.252
was less than a mile from
John and Joan's house.

20:14.254 --> 20:15.770
Now, this may be a long shot,

20:15.772 --> 20:17.438
but I've reached out to
a local police captain

20:17.440 --> 20:19.941
so he can tell me all
about this unsolved crime.

20:25.982 --> 20:29.717
Cap, thanks for meeting me.
I appreciate that.

20:29.719 --> 20:31.519
Reason I called you is
because of the article

20:31.521 --> 20:33.521
I came across about the
three chopped-up bodies

20:33.523 --> 20:34.639
in the box cars.

20:34.641 --> 20:36.691
Were they found here in Struthers?

20:36.693 --> 20:38.559
No, they were found in Pennsylvania.

20:38.561 --> 20:40.695
Um, but it was determined
that they had been

20:40.697 --> 20:44.299
sitting in our Struthers
yard for several months.

20:44.301 --> 20:45.933
And I'm pretty close to
my client's property.

20:45.935 --> 20:47.135
It's less than a mile from here.

20:47.137 --> 20:48.536
Yes.

20:48.538 --> 20:49.871
Okay. Take me through what happened.

20:49.873 --> 20:51.939
May 3, 1940,

20:51.941 --> 20:55.476
rail road inspectors ran
across a rail road car.

20:55.478 --> 20:58.646
And when they opened it up,
they found a mutilated body.

20:58.648 --> 21:01.249
The body was cut up into
seven different pieces.

21:01.251 --> 21:04.002
They immediately then called
the police department, you know,

21:04.004 --> 21:05.670
to start an investigation.

21:05.672 --> 21:08.990
This was the first box car
where they found the first body.

21:08.992 --> 21:10.291
So, the bodies weren't together

21:10.293 --> 21:11.376
when they found the first one?

21:11.378 --> 21:13.127
No... no, they weren't. Three box cars

21:13.129 --> 21:16.264
down from the first one,
they found a second body.

21:16.266 --> 21:17.598
He was stripped down naked,

21:17.600 --> 21:21.019
and there was the word "Nazi"
carved into his chest.

21:21.021 --> 21:22.637
They also determined it was a large amount

21:22.639 --> 21:23.771
of blood near the body,

21:23.773 --> 21:26.090
and they determined that that victim

21:26.092 --> 21:27.675
was murdered in that box car.

21:27.677 --> 21:30.928
The victim was a James
David Nicholson, okay?

21:30.930 --> 21:33.681
He was originally from Chicago.

21:33.683 --> 21:36.334
Moved down the line a little bit farther.

21:36.336 --> 21:38.670
And by that picture,
they found a third body,

21:38.672 --> 21:40.788
which they determined to be a female.

21:40.790 --> 21:43.658
She was also mutilated
similar to the first body

21:43.660 --> 21:44.726
that they found.

21:44.728 --> 21:47.929
Wow.

21:47.931 --> 21:52.767
The dead lady who hates men is
dragging herself up the stairs.

21:52.769 --> 21:54.602
What the [bleep] happened to her ass?

21:54.604 --> 21:57.221
Is this before she died?

21:57.223 --> 21:59.240
The angry woman is showing me the events

21:59.242 --> 22:01.943
that led up to her death.

22:01.945 --> 22:04.112
And it's incredibly gruesome.

22:04.114 --> 22:08.783
Someone is after her.

22:08.785 --> 22:13.187
She's trying to get away.

22:13.189 --> 22:16.290
Oh, she's frickin' [bleep]

22:19.963 --> 22:24.615
She's young, um, 30, 40 maybe.

22:24.617 --> 22:27.068
She hasn't been dead that long.

22:27.070 --> 22:29.153
You know, 50 years.

22:34.144 --> 22:36.394
Her head is pounding.
Her heart is pounding.

22:36.396 --> 22:40.415
I feel like she's losing blood.

22:40.417 --> 22:42.734
Someone is on her.

22:48.124 --> 22:51.159
I think it's a male.

22:51.161 --> 22:52.794
I don't feel very well.

22:52.796 --> 22:55.730
She can't breathe. She can't breathe.

22:55.732 --> 22:59.066
She's talking about her neck got broken.

23:03.706 --> 23:05.773
So, what do we know about the victims?

23:05.775 --> 23:07.391
They were all vagrants.

23:07.393 --> 23:09.060
So this guy was going
after people that nobody

23:09.062 --> 23:10.344
- really cared about.
- Yeah.

23:10.346 --> 23:12.096
I mean, this screams
serial killer, obviously.

23:12.098 --> 23:13.748
We determined it might be part

23:13.750 --> 23:17.585
of what they called The
Mad Butcher of Cleveland...

23:17.587 --> 23:19.387
- Okay...
- which was an ongoing investigation

23:19.389 --> 23:20.872
of a serial killer.

23:20.874 --> 23:22.590
Did they put a number on...

23:22.592 --> 23:23.925
as to how many he might have killed?

23:23.927 --> 23:26.394
There's been said it's been upwards of 50.

23:26.396 --> 23:30.798
These victims they credit as
being number 22, 23 and 24.

23:30.800 --> 23:32.216
Did they ever have any evidence

23:32.218 --> 23:33.551
or any clue who might have did this?

23:33.553 --> 23:35.620
One thing that was all
similar to all the bodies

23:35.622 --> 23:37.655
was how precise it was done.

23:37.657 --> 23:39.340
They said the person that did this

23:39.342 --> 23:40.508
really knew what he was doing.

23:40.510 --> 23:42.493
- So either a doctor or a butcher.
- Yeah.

23:42.495 --> 23:44.712
Did they ever bring anybody
in to question them?

23:44.714 --> 23:46.264
I believe they brought several people in,

23:46.266 --> 23:49.133
but they were never able
to pin this on anybody.

23:49.135 --> 23:50.885
Okay.

23:53.790 --> 23:58.960
More of the messed-up
dead people are over here.

23:58.962 --> 24:02.096
There's a handful of them

24:02.098 --> 24:07.768
just kind of gauging the amount
of body parts and whatnot.

24:07.770 --> 24:10.738
They were struggling and struggling.

24:10.740 --> 24:13.374
And then, it ended like this,
so it's, like, all [bleep]

24:13.376 --> 24:14.425
We had [bleep] lives.

24:14.427 --> 24:16.227
And then, we died in a horrible way,

24:16.229 --> 24:19.096
and it sucks.

24:19.098 --> 24:24.252
And I am seeing, maybe, a rail road.

24:24.254 --> 24:26.120
Like, I'm hearing that.

24:26.122 --> 24:29.423
So I don't know if it was a train accident.

24:34.130 --> 24:36.297
I don't know if they were on the train.

24:36.299 --> 24:39.834
It doesn't seem like they were on it.

24:39.836 --> 24:44.405
Whatever it was,
it was not handled properly at all.

24:44.407 --> 24:48.309
And that's why these
people are not at rest.

24:48.311 --> 24:49.744
They're freaking out. They're upset.

24:49.746 --> 24:54.115
That's what I'm hearing,
is the right people need to pay.

25:00.890 --> 25:03.174
I saw several dead people during my walk,

25:03.176 --> 25:05.693
but the mutilated bodies
surrounding the living woman

25:05.695 --> 25:08.095
had me the most concerned.

25:08.097 --> 25:09.397
It was in the basement.

25:09.399 --> 25:14.802
What she saw was all of
these people on the floor,

25:14.804 --> 25:16.971
crawling towards her.

25:16.973 --> 25:19.123
Some of them were missing limbs,

25:19.125 --> 25:21.876
some of them, it was just their head.

25:21.878 --> 25:24.345
They were all mutilated.

25:24.347 --> 25:26.180
Bloody, pretty gory.

25:29.452 --> 25:32.219
Is that what you saw?

25:32.221 --> 25:34.422
Yes, that's what I saw.

25:53.277 --> 25:55.995
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations,

25:55.997 --> 25:57.363
we're ready to reveal our findings

25:57.365 --> 26:02.418
to each other and our
clients for the first time.

26:02.420 --> 26:04.453
Amy, you're looking at a couple in crisis.

26:04.455 --> 26:07.022
Um, this is John and Joan.

26:07.024 --> 26:10.426
They live here with their two kids.

26:10.428 --> 26:11.961
This is Dalton, who is 13.

26:11.963 --> 26:15.331
This is Delani,
who will be turning 17 very shortly.

26:15.333 --> 26:16.432
Now, everybody in the house

26:16.434 --> 26:19.101
is having experiences except for John.

26:19.103 --> 26:21.971
And that's causing a little bit of tension

26:21.973 --> 26:23.522
within their relationship.

26:23.524 --> 26:26.342
Joan called us in because she's
scared for herself and the kids

26:26.344 --> 26:30.012
and for her marriage.

26:30.014 --> 26:31.480
She wants to know what the hell is here

26:31.482 --> 26:33.666
and how to get rid of it.

26:33.668 --> 26:36.302
So now that Amy knows a little
bit about what's going on here,

26:36.304 --> 26:38.621
I'm gonna ask her to
tell us about her walk.

26:38.623 --> 26:40.723
Okay.

26:40.725 --> 26:45.911
When I got here, I saw a lot of people

26:45.913 --> 26:48.297
that were mutilated.

26:48.299 --> 26:52.267
They were, like, chopped up or something.

26:52.269 --> 26:54.837
There was, like,
moaning and crying going on.

26:54.839 --> 26:58.657
And then, this woman kind of,
as much as she could,

26:58.659 --> 27:00.743
put herself back together.

27:00.745 --> 27:02.244
One of the things that she told me

27:02.246 --> 27:06.799
was that they had had awful lives anyways.

27:06.801 --> 27:09.418
And then, they died horribly.

27:09.420 --> 27:12.321
And then, I was seeing train tracks.

27:12.323 --> 27:15.791
I also got a lot of anger
from these people,

27:15.793 --> 27:20.112
and they were saying how what
happened was not their fault

27:20.114 --> 27:26.669
and that the proper people
have to, uh, pay for it.

27:26.671 --> 27:29.238
That's some pretty interesting
stuff you uncovered.

27:29.240 --> 27:32.041
I did some research on a case.

27:32.043 --> 27:33.342
Back in May of 1940,

27:33.344 --> 27:35.944
a group of rail road
workers in Pennsylvania

27:35.946 --> 27:38.747
found a badly decomposed and mutilated body

27:38.749 --> 27:39.748
in a rail road car.

27:39.750 --> 27:42.351
Oh.

27:42.353 --> 27:44.353
So, when the inspectors
went out to the box car,

27:44.355 --> 27:47.556
they found a body that was chopped up

27:47.558 --> 27:49.291
- into seven pieces...
- Mm.

27:49.293 --> 27:51.477
That was wrapped in a burlap bag.

27:51.479 --> 27:55.931
And they found two more
victims in separate box cars.

27:55.933 --> 27:58.183
Now, you may be wondering why
I'm telling you about bodies

27:58.185 --> 28:00.736
that were discovered in Pittsburgh.

28:00.738 --> 28:04.773
These trains had been in
Struthers for several weeks,

28:04.775 --> 28:08.544
and they're pretty sure that the
bodies were here decomposing.

28:08.546 --> 28:13.015
That rail road yard is less
than a mile from your house.

28:13.017 --> 28:15.284
Now, they believe this
was the work of a guy

28:15.286 --> 28:16.819
they call the Cleveland Butcher.

28:16.821 --> 28:18.921
- Okay.
- This guy was never caught,

28:18.923 --> 28:21.957
and they're pretty sure
he killed up to 50 people.

28:21.959 --> 28:23.792
Now, you said the... the...
the victims said

28:23.794 --> 28:26.011
- they had terrible lives, right?
- Mm-hmm.

28:26.013 --> 28:27.596
Well, these were all hobos and...

28:27.598 --> 28:31.683
and basically street people
that were being murdered.

28:31.685 --> 28:33.969
I got one of the police reports.

28:33.971 --> 28:39.391
And one of the other clues
was the precision of the cuts.

28:39.393 --> 28:40.692
They thought it may have been a doctor.

28:44.765 --> 28:47.216
To this day, this case is still open.

28:47.218 --> 28:48.884
Oh.

28:48.886 --> 28:50.219
- Interesting.
- Okay.

28:50.221 --> 28:52.488
So this is what you might have seen.

28:52.490 --> 28:54.857
Well, I might have been duped again.

28:54.859 --> 28:57.192
I'm pissed. Okay.

28:57.194 --> 28:58.393
What do you mean?

28:58.395 --> 29:02.831
The first guy that I
really was involved with,

29:02.833 --> 29:05.984
he was extremely articulate,
very well educated.

29:05.986 --> 29:09.371
He stated that he was a doctor.

29:09.373 --> 29:12.474
At first, I kind of had an...
an affinity for him.

29:12.476 --> 29:16.378
But that began to change when
he started acting strangely.

29:16.380 --> 29:20.249
When I was outside with
the mutilated woman,

29:20.251 --> 29:21.717
he looked at her.

29:21.719 --> 29:25.654
And then, he, like, went like, "Ah,"

29:25.656 --> 29:28.490
which I thought was very
strange at the time.

29:28.492 --> 29:30.526
But now that I think about it,

29:30.528 --> 29:33.395
something definitely was off about him.

29:33.397 --> 29:35.681
And now I'm just realizing.

29:35.683 --> 29:38.100
Holy [bleep]

29:41.739 --> 29:45.390
And then, I went up to the
back bedroom upstairs.

29:45.392 --> 29:47.709
That's Delani's room, I think.

29:47.711 --> 29:50.145
He thinks that room is his office.

29:50.147 --> 29:53.665
He doesn't want any living
people in his space.

29:53.667 --> 29:55.767
It really agitates him.

29:55.769 --> 30:01.373
And then, I did see that he
would possibly be seen as,

30:01.375 --> 30:05.861
like, a shadowy figure.

30:05.863 --> 30:09.331
Explain to Amy how she sees
a dark shadow in her room.

30:09.333 --> 30:11.200
She'll be laying in bed.

30:11.202 --> 30:13.735
And sometimes, she'll look at her doorway,

30:13.737 --> 30:16.171
- and he'll be standing there.
- Okay.

30:16.173 --> 30:19.491
She has seen him multiple times.

30:19.493 --> 30:20.809
The scratches Delani has.

30:20.811 --> 30:23.946
I got a photo here I want to show you.

30:23.948 --> 30:25.647
This is on her lower back.

30:25.649 --> 30:27.382
- You took this photo, correct?
- Yeah.

30:27.384 --> 30:30.102
Oh, my gosh.

30:30.104 --> 30:33.755
Could this doctor do that to her?

30:33.757 --> 30:35.958
I think it's possible, yeah.

30:42.800 --> 30:45.000
So, what else did you see?

30:45.002 --> 30:47.636
I went out into the backyard,

30:47.638 --> 30:51.874
and I saw this weird dead person.

30:51.876 --> 30:55.210
He was, like, half-man and half-wolf.

30:55.212 --> 30:59.014
He does feed off the
energy of the human heart.

30:59.016 --> 31:00.482
It's almost like a battery to him.

31:00.484 --> 31:03.252
So he gets, like, charged up.

31:03.254 --> 31:06.154
He likes to make people become, like, numb,

31:06.156 --> 31:09.558
so they lose their legs
kind of out from under them.

31:09.560 --> 31:12.261
Um, and that way, it disables them.

31:12.263 --> 31:14.830
They'll fall down, and
he can try to, like,

31:14.832 --> 31:16.765
get as much energy from the heart.

31:16.767 --> 31:19.101
But his goal isn't to kill anybody

31:19.103 --> 31:22.421
because that's his, like, food source.

31:22.423 --> 31:23.555
You might as well tell her, Joan,

31:23.557 --> 31:26.391
what happened to you with the stairs.

31:26.393 --> 31:29.528
The first time I fell down the stairs,

31:29.530 --> 31:31.613
my legs went out from under me.

31:31.615 --> 31:34.816
The second time, I was pushed.

31:34.818 --> 31:37.486
Wow.

31:42.860 --> 31:45.077
Four years ago, she had a heart attack.

31:45.079 --> 31:46.495
Really?

31:46.497 --> 31:48.997
Oh, yeah.

31:48.999 --> 31:51.984
I was down in the basement,
and I felt like I...

31:51.986 --> 31:53.969
I couldn't breathe.

31:53.971 --> 31:56.805
And it just felt like the life
was getting sucked out of me,

31:56.807 --> 31:59.274
and I couldn't get up.

31:59.276 --> 32:00.842
Oh, my gosh.

32:00.844 --> 32:02.544
How come you didn't tell me about that?

32:02.546 --> 32:05.080
I didn't know that that would have anything

32:05.082 --> 32:06.481
- to do...
- Right.

32:06.483 --> 32:08.333
With what was going on with the house.

32:08.335 --> 32:11.737
Nobody knew.

32:11.739 --> 32:14.273
Nobody but him and my kids.

32:14.275 --> 32:16.458
Did you ever have any heart
issues before you moved here?

32:16.460 --> 32:18.460
- No.
- No.

32:21.048 --> 32:22.347
I knew it.

32:24.935 --> 32:27.703
The interesting part is that
Joan isn't the only person

32:27.705 --> 32:29.705
to take a bad fall down those steps.

32:29.707 --> 32:32.975
The previous homeowner,
a woman named Mary Vlosich,

32:32.977 --> 32:34.826
she was 95 years old.

32:34.828 --> 32:38.380
And in 2003, the neighbors
noticed that she wasn't around

32:38.382 --> 32:40.615
and her mail was not being taken in.

32:40.617 --> 32:42.484
So, when the police finally came,

32:42.486 --> 32:44.586
uh, they found Mary Vlosich at the bottom

32:44.588 --> 32:47.072
- of the basement staircase...
- Wow.

32:47.074 --> 32:49.424
Where she laid for almost three days.

32:49.426 --> 32:51.760
This is her obituary.

32:51.762 --> 32:53.996
She died a couple days later

32:53.998 --> 32:55.998
from the injuries that she
sustained during the fall.

32:56.000 --> 32:57.733
Now, she's 95. You figure, all right.

32:57.735 --> 32:59.434
She... she fell.

32:59.436 --> 33:00.902
But I talked to the nephew.

33:00.904 --> 33:04.506
Apparently, even at that age,
she was independent and sharp.

33:04.508 --> 33:06.024
I just find it interesting that she falls

33:06.026 --> 33:08.777
down the same staircase
that you fall down twice.

33:08.779 --> 33:09.845
Right.

33:09.847 --> 33:11.346
Interesting.

33:11.348 --> 33:13.048
You still skeptical?

33:15.452 --> 33:17.202
My wheels are turning.

33:21.525 --> 33:23.608
There's another person that I encountered,

33:23.610 --> 33:25.961
and this woman is the one

33:25.963 --> 33:28.563
who is causing the most problems here.

33:28.565 --> 33:31.233
She was crawling up the stairs.

33:31.235 --> 33:32.834
I saw a lot of blood.

33:32.836 --> 33:34.936
Then, when she was up in the hallway,

33:34.938 --> 33:37.956
I saw that somebody broke her neck,

33:37.958 --> 33:42.177
and that is probably what killed her.

33:42.179 --> 33:45.030
Her murderer was a male.

33:45.032 --> 33:48.884
And now she really dislikes men a lot.

33:48.886 --> 33:53.321
She expressed the desire for,
you know, all men to die.

33:57.194 --> 34:02.431
But then, I went down to the basement,

34:02.433 --> 34:07.686
and she, uh, was there.

34:07.688 --> 34:10.839
And she's very focused on a living woman.

34:10.841 --> 34:15.444
Um, there's some kind of attachment there.

34:15.446 --> 34:18.780
And what the dead woman is actually doing

34:18.782 --> 34:21.216
is trying to jump you,

34:21.217 --> 34:23.652
which is trying to take over your body.

34:23.654 --> 34:27.472
But she's also very bad at it.

34:27.474 --> 34:31.793
So this can cause, uh, you to be sick.

34:31.795 --> 34:38.483
It can cause cellular issues,
possibly causing tumors.

34:38.485 --> 34:40.235
Oh, God.

34:43.072 --> 34:46.041
I've been in the hospital how many times?

34:46.043 --> 34:47.442
Five, six.

34:47.444 --> 34:50.712
Nobody can figure out what's
going on in your ribs.

34:50.714 --> 34:53.348
The only answer that we ever get is,
it's all inflamed.

34:53.350 --> 34:54.815
All her ribs are inflamed.

34:54.818 --> 34:56.067
Or her gall bladder is inflamed.

34:56.069 --> 34:57.936
Her intestines are inflamed.

34:57.938 --> 35:01.373
But they'll shrug their shoulders,
don't know.

35:01.375 --> 35:03.825
The pain is just so bad.

35:03.827 --> 35:07.512
I told my husband.
I said, "All's I want to do

35:07.514 --> 35:09.764
is just have another heart
attack and be done with this.

35:09.766 --> 35:10.966
I can't do it no more."

35:10.968 --> 35:14.002
Uhh...

35:19.226 --> 35:21.910
So the... the other thing is,

35:21.912 --> 35:27.115
any time the dead woman was
around the living woman,

35:27.117 --> 35:32.287
it would trigger her to open and,
like, see things.

35:34.091 --> 35:35.757
Like what?

35:35.759 --> 35:37.092
So I had a sketch done

35:37.094 --> 35:42.430
of what I think she sees when she's in bed.

35:52.075 --> 35:53.925
Are you ready for this?

36:23.008 --> 36:25.058
So I had a sketch done

36:25.060 --> 36:28.478
of what I think she sees when she's in bed.

36:36.738 --> 36:38.488
Are you ready for this?

36:56.508 --> 37:00.193
She's woken up and seen
shadows around her bed.

37:00.195 --> 37:03.213
And I've been telling you,
"This house is making me sick,

37:03.215 --> 37:05.081
and I hate the basement."

37:05.083 --> 37:06.916
I've been telling you, "It's the house.

37:06.918 --> 37:11.604
It's the house. It's that [bleep] house."

37:14.593 --> 37:15.909
Why are they around my bed?

37:15.911 --> 37:19.245
What do they want? They want help.

37:19.247 --> 37:24.100
What I've seen is when
someone kills someone

37:24.102 --> 37:25.652
and they're still alive,

37:25.654 --> 37:30.256
those people that that person murdered wait.

37:30.258 --> 37:33.193
They're always around that person.

37:33.195 --> 37:38.231
When that person dies,
the victims are there.

37:38.233 --> 37:39.799
Waiting on the person who killed them.

37:39.801 --> 37:41.234
Yes.

37:43.238 --> 37:45.872
So it's my belief that
this dead woman is here

37:45.874 --> 37:48.408
because you have abilities.

37:48.410 --> 37:56.282
And that's what attracted her to you.

37:56.284 --> 38:00.854
Unfortunately, this dead woman, I believe,

38:00.856 --> 38:05.692
was a victim of this serial-killing doctor.

38:05.694 --> 38:08.344
And due to that, um,

38:08.346 --> 38:14.267
she has this attachment to him
as well as many other victims.

38:14.269 --> 38:17.587
So they're all webbed together.

38:17.589 --> 38:21.941
So what the dead lady would like to do

38:21.943 --> 38:24.194
is take over your body

38:24.196 --> 38:28.147
so that she can be essentially alive again.

38:32.137 --> 38:35.154
What would she be able
to do if she did that?

38:35.156 --> 38:37.290
There would be aggressive behavior,
probably,

38:37.292 --> 38:39.592
towards the men in the household.

38:39.594 --> 38:41.494
She would probably try to torture the men

38:41.496 --> 38:43.530
in the household.

38:43.532 --> 38:46.182
You know, she wants men to die.

38:49.938 --> 38:52.705
Well, after our investigation,
we learned two things.

38:52.707 --> 38:54.641
You're not crazy,

38:54.643 --> 38:58.127
and you and your son may be in danger.

38:58.129 --> 39:00.346
But we still haven't
answered the big question.

39:00.348 --> 39:02.365
Can you get whatever is here the hell out

39:02.367 --> 39:04.951
and live a normal life
with your family again?

39:04.953 --> 39:09.589
For that, I'm going to turn
it over to my partner, Amy.

39:09.591 --> 39:13.209
The situation here is
that it's not the house.

39:13.211 --> 39:18.164
It's the unfortunate proximity
to some of these murders.

39:18.166 --> 39:19.332
I want an individual

39:19.334 --> 39:22.936
who is a male and who practices witchcraft

39:22.938 --> 39:25.655
to do a ritual to push out the dead.

39:25.657 --> 39:28.625
And then, I want him to do a blessing.

39:28.627 --> 39:31.294
So once the witch comes in
and pushes the dead out,

39:31.296 --> 39:32.712
where are they going to go?

39:32.714 --> 39:36.583
They're going to go
outside of the perimeter.

39:36.585 --> 39:42.472
They want the doctor to be brought forward

39:42.474 --> 39:45.842
and to pay for what he did to them.

39:45.844 --> 39:48.361
Now, of course, him being deceased,

39:48.363 --> 39:52.949
the only way that he
can kind of pay for this

39:52.951 --> 39:56.202
and they can find vindication

39:56.204 --> 40:01.708
is that the public knows
this person was in fact bad.

40:01.710 --> 40:05.228
After that, I want the witch
to take this tar water

40:05.230 --> 40:06.646
and take a dropper

40:06.648 --> 40:11.301
and put one drop in the
center of each room,

40:11.303 --> 40:16.389
then to go outside and do the
perimeter of the property.

40:16.391 --> 40:21.027
And just a drop every,
you know, several feet.

40:21.029 --> 40:24.998
No dead are going to
come in and bother you.

40:25.000 --> 40:28.568
So, once the witch comes in and does this,

40:28.570 --> 40:30.003
she'll feel better?

40:30.005 --> 40:31.471
Oh, yeah.

40:31.473 --> 40:32.505
All the stuff that...

40:32.507 --> 40:33.506
The shadow figures they're seeing?

40:33.508 --> 40:34.874
Right.

40:34.876 --> 40:36.109
Sounds like you're going to be okay.

40:40.081 --> 40:44.767
He wasn't believing,
and I thought I was going crazy.

40:47.806 --> 40:49.789
This is happening to her.

40:49.791 --> 40:53.660
You have to respect that
and just be compassionate.

40:53.662 --> 40:55.361
Just be there with love.

40:55.363 --> 40:56.829
At the same time,

40:56.831 --> 41:00.233
you have to respect that and be like,
"That's who he is.

41:00.235 --> 41:02.435
He's not having this experience.

41:02.437 --> 41:05.104
He can't see what I'm going through."

41:05.106 --> 41:08.775
So, you have to meet in the middle.

41:08.777 --> 41:11.027
When I'm up all night

41:11.029 --> 41:14.981
being agitated sometimes by this

41:14.983 --> 41:16.416
and I don't sleep all night

41:16.418 --> 41:18.885
and I'm thinking I'm crazy at the time,

41:18.887 --> 41:22.005
just tell me it's going
to be okay and just...

41:22.007 --> 41:25.058
just hug me, and that's it.

41:25.060 --> 41:27.627
I... I know you don't understand
because you don't see it.

41:27.629 --> 41:32.382
I know that, but just believe
me because I'm your wife.

41:32.384 --> 41:33.466
I do. I believe you.

41:33.468 --> 41:35.184
Just believe... you believe me now.

41:35.186 --> 41:37.937
No. I've always believed you.

41:37.939 --> 41:40.606
Are you going to contact a
male witch and get this done?

41:40.608 --> 41:42.175
Absolutely, I am.

41:42.177 --> 41:43.309
Okay.

41:43.311 --> 41:45.511
I mean, whatever it takes.
Because, I... I mean,

41:45.513 --> 41:47.947
I want everything back the way it was.

41:50.051 --> 41:53.052
With all of the dead
inside this location,

41:53.054 --> 41:56.923
Joan and John have their
work cut out for them.

41:56.925 --> 41:58.975
But I believe that if they work together,

41:58.977 --> 42:01.394
they'll be able to free
themselves of the evil

42:01.396 --> 42:03.196
that's tormenting their family.
