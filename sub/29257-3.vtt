WEBVTT

00:15.849 --> 00:18.351
There is no higher calling

00:18.518 --> 00:21.396
than the Order of Lesser Service.

00:21.521 --> 00:22.856
So, no dawdling!

00:23.982 --> 00:27.152
There's good, hard work to be done.

00:27.360 --> 00:28.445
Keep up!

00:29.696 --> 00:31.823
That means you, Princess.

00:31.948 --> 00:33.241
-Hm.

00:34.034 --> 00:34.909
Oh!

00:34.993 --> 00:38.496
No carriages
in the Order of Lesser Service, Princess.

00:38.872 --> 00:41.041
You walk like the rest of us.

00:42.333 --> 00:43.376
Come along.

00:43.501 --> 00:46.588
The Order of Lesser Service
is not a punishment,

00:46.671 --> 00:49.132
it's an opportunity to lift yourself up

00:49.340 --> 00:51.342
by performing the lowliest of deeds...

00:51.426 --> 00:53.762
Bet we're chewing snippit root again.

00:53.845 --> 00:56.473
- Why would we do that?

00:56.556 --> 00:59.517
Well, they don't have teeth yet,
so we have to chew it up for them

00:59.601 --> 01:02.645
-and spit it in their mouths.
- That's repugnant.

01:05.106 --> 01:07.859
Go. One foot in front of the other.

01:10.987 --> 01:15.283
I have something very special
planned for you all.

01:17.118 --> 01:19.245
You know, I too was once a wide-eyed...

01:19.329 --> 01:22.207
-Are you really a princess?
-I am.

01:22.290 --> 01:26.044
I never met a princess before.
I always imaged them having shinier hair.

01:26.127 --> 01:28.379
Is this your first time
in the Order of Lesser Service?

01:28.588 --> 01:30.131
-It is.
- Me too.

01:30.215 --> 01:31.716
I became friends with a Spriton boy.

01:31.800 --> 01:34.302
I made him sweet mini-katnies,
and he made me laugh,

01:34.385 --> 01:37.013
but my parents didn't like
that he wasn't Vapran, so...

01:37.097 --> 01:39.182
jingle-jangle, time to put on the hat!

01:39.516 --> 01:41.518
-It doesn't seem fair.
-What's your name?

01:42.435 --> 01:45.605
-Juni.
-Brea. It's a pleasure to meet you.

01:47.023 --> 01:49.067
I always thought
I'd make a fantastic princess.

01:49.150 --> 01:51.027
I've got the hair for it. It's very shiny.

01:51.111 --> 01:53.863
So, why did you get sent
to the Order of Lesser Service?

01:54.155 --> 01:57.575
I created a diplomatic incident
by erasing a Sifan elder's memory.

01:57.826 --> 02:00.161
-Hm.
-Uh...

02:01.746 --> 02:06.334
Ah, at last, we arrive
at today's opportunity for service.

02:07.001 --> 02:09.546
-A filthy Podling village.

02:10.547 --> 02:12.423
-Ooh!

02:31.568 --> 02:34.195
The Deterge is upon us!

02:35.196 --> 02:37.699
Oh, no! Not the Deterge!

02:45.874 --> 02:51.087
The Deterge is an opportunity
to cleanse ourselves of our mistakes

02:51.171 --> 02:53.840
by cleansing Podlings.

02:54.382 --> 02:55.550
Ah!

02:55.675 --> 02:59.929
There is no filthier creature
in all of Thra than the Podling.

03:00.013 --> 03:03.433
The Podling takes to dirt
like a Sifan takes to the sea.

03:06.811 --> 03:10.982
Which means every Podling,
no matter how disgusting...

03:11.524 --> 03:13.818
- You forgot your pants!
- ...is a gift.

03:14.194 --> 03:16.237
-Come on! Would you hold still?

03:16.321 --> 03:18.489
...wash away yesterday's misdeed

03:18.740 --> 03:23.036
by scouring away layer after layer,
from rind to nails.

03:33.504 --> 03:36.132
Brea is the most selfish
Gelfling in all Ha'rar.

03:36.216 --> 03:39.427
She never comes to court.
She just spends all day in the library.

03:39.719 --> 03:42.639
She's a princess.
She has responsibilities,

03:42.722 --> 03:45.016
not just to us,
but to her fellow Gelfling.

03:45.099 --> 03:47.644
-Mm-hm.
- It's Mother's fault.

03:48.269 --> 03:51.606
She spoils her. Brea's her favorite.

03:52.440 --> 03:55.652
The Order of Lesser Service
is exactly what Brea needs.

03:57.737 --> 03:59.781
-You don't agree?
-Hm?

04:01.032 --> 04:02.450
I didn't say anything.

04:02.533 --> 04:03.952
I know you.

04:04.035 --> 04:06.913
I know what your silence means.
Come on, out with it.

04:11.834 --> 04:13.670
I don't think it's Brea you're angry with.

04:13.753 --> 04:15.171
No! It is.

04:15.546 --> 04:19.008
Pretend all you want, Seladon,
but I see you.

04:19.550 --> 04:22.136
I see all the responsibilities
you take on.

04:22.220 --> 04:25.473
The meetings, the ceremonies,
the rituals.

04:26.099 --> 04:28.142
You work harder than all of us.

04:28.226 --> 04:29.894
Even harder than Mother.

04:30.478 --> 04:32.272
Then why doesn't Mother see that?

04:33.064 --> 04:37.360
Mother is toughest on you,
because you have the hardest path ahead.

04:37.860 --> 04:39.946
You will be All-Maudra one day.

04:41.739 --> 04:43.950
Good thing you're also the strongest.

04:45.451 --> 04:47.996
I don't feel strong.

04:49.998 --> 04:52.917
I would have run away
with the Sifa long trine past

04:53.084 --> 04:56.129
if I had to be at half the meetings
you attend in a single day.

04:56.212 --> 04:59.882
They really are so boring.

05:02.719 --> 05:04.470
Pardon the interruption, Princesses.

05:04.554 --> 05:07.140
The All-Maudra needs to see
Princess Tavra right away.

05:09.976 --> 05:11.769
How did you get so dirty?

05:12.270 --> 05:14.314
-Calm down! Stop it!

05:14.397 --> 05:16.149
- Podling! Podling!

05:16.607 --> 05:19.360
-You need to wear pants!
- It's just a little water!

05:19.986 --> 05:21.904
I beg you to keep still!

05:22.071 --> 05:24.782
Expediency is the key, Princess,

05:24.866 --> 05:27.744
-else it will be a long trine for you.

05:27.869 --> 05:29.787
-Trine?

05:29.871 --> 05:31.414
I can't be here a full trine.

05:31.497 --> 05:33.124
I must return to Ha'rar
before the winds change,

05:33.207 --> 05:35.710
or else it will be the end of all things.
Or maybe the beginning.

05:35.793 --> 05:39.130
Hmph! You obviously have sun frenzy.

05:39.213 --> 05:43.134
Ugh! I don't have sun frenzy.
I know all about sun frenzy.

05:43.217 --> 05:45.511
I read <i>Durken's Deliriums,</i> twice.

05:45.595 --> 05:47.347
-Ow! Ow!

05:47.555 --> 05:48.389
Hey!

05:52.518 --> 05:54.437
Well, go get her.

05:59.442 --> 06:01.944
Dear...

06:02.195 --> 06:04.530
Podling! Podling!

06:06.532 --> 06:09.452
Get back here this minute! Podling!

06:10.453 --> 06:12.622
-Where are you?

06:19.295 --> 06:22.382
- Come finish your bath.

06:29.222 --> 06:32.100
-Where did you go?

06:32.517 --> 06:34.769
I've got you now.
No! Whoa, whoa, whoa!

06:34.852 --> 06:36.270
-Stop! Ow!

06:36.354 --> 06:39.190
Stop, Podling! Stop! Calm.

06:39.273 --> 06:41.067
-Shh...

06:41.442 --> 06:42.568
There we go.

06:43.152 --> 06:45.029
-Okay, listen.

06:45.196 --> 06:49.158
You don't want to get clean, and I don't
want to clean you, so let's make a deal.

06:50.326 --> 06:54.705
We both go our separate ways,
and we trust that the other won't squeal.

06:54.789 --> 06:55.748
Sound good?

06:58.793 --> 07:00.169
-I'll take that as a yes?

07:42.837 --> 07:44.297
Do you hear them?

07:44.380 --> 07:46.507
Arathim?

07:46.966 --> 07:49.469
No. All the creatures of Thra.

07:50.261 --> 07:53.306
I never imagined
there'd be so much life topside.

07:54.056 --> 07:55.224
It's beautiful.

07:55.641 --> 07:57.560
Arathim <i>ne </i>beautiful.

07:58.436 --> 08:00.438
All creatures are part of Thra.

08:02.398 --> 08:04.025
What happens if we fail?<i> </i>

08:04.984 --> 08:07.069
The Darkening will destroy everything.

08:08.613 --> 08:09.697
Deet. Hup.

08:10.072 --> 08:11.908
All-Maudra. Win.

08:12.658 --> 08:13.618
You're right.

08:14.160 --> 08:17.455
Together, we unite the Gelfling
and stop the Darkening.

08:19.540 --> 08:21.709
All Gelfling not help.

08:22.376 --> 08:23.920
Why wouldn't they all want to help?

08:24.629 --> 08:25.546
Hup knows.

08:26.881 --> 08:28.841
Gelfling clans not friends, ya.

08:31.302 --> 08:33.012
You Grottan Gelfling.

08:33.387 --> 08:37.225
Hup pretend to be Vapran Gelfling, ya.

08:39.060 --> 08:41.979
Don't like Grottan <i>Gee.</i> No good!

08:42.271 --> 08:43.397
Different <i>Gee.</i>

08:43.564 --> 08:44.732
Blech!

08:45.274 --> 08:46.234
You go away!

08:48.778 --> 08:50.363
Just because they're different?

08:50.947 --> 08:52.949
<i>Ye.</i>
Hm.

08:53.783 --> 08:54.825
I don't accept that.

08:55.576 --> 08:57.828
Getting along may be hard at first.

09:02.500 --> 09:04.252
But like anything else in life...

09:15.888 --> 09:17.723
...it just takes time to adjust.

09:18.641 --> 09:20.643
Hm... huh.

09:25.147 --> 09:27.692
- Look!
- Yotubi Stonewood clan.

09:27.775 --> 09:30.570
That Stone-in-the-Wood.

09:34.073 --> 09:36.993
Where's your sense of adventure? Come on!

09:50.006 --> 09:51.215
- Use both hands!
- I am.

09:51.757 --> 09:54.635
-What do you think I'm doing?
- Don't twist it. Push!

09:56.262 --> 09:57.555
Lift it higher.

09:58.306 --> 10:01.392
-It's as high as I can get it.
- Push.

10:02.059 --> 10:03.894
Here, let me help.

10:03.978 --> 10:05.062
Oh, thank you.

10:12.778 --> 10:14.739
There we are.

10:15.906 --> 10:18.659
Hush now, childling. All is well.

10:19.619 --> 10:21.287
-There, there.
- Thank you, friend.

10:21.996 --> 10:24.915
We were on our way to Sami Thicket
to trade our grains

10:24.999 --> 10:27.126
when a bump sent our wheel flying.

10:27.877 --> 10:31.881
Huh.
Sami Thicket, huh? That's quite a journey.

10:32.089 --> 10:34.425
The blight on our land
has left us no choice

10:34.508 --> 10:36.844
but to trade far outside our village.

10:36.927 --> 10:38.012
Oh, I'm sorry.

10:38.763 --> 10:40.014
Your bags.

10:40.097 --> 10:41.057
Thank you.

10:45.853 --> 10:47.188
He's a castle guard.

10:47.688 --> 10:50.066
He could be the one. What's his name?

10:50.149 --> 10:52.109
He can't be. He came to our aid.

10:56.197 --> 10:57.281
What was it?

10:58.199 --> 11:00.201
-That's it. Rian!

11:01.285 --> 11:02.286
Do we know each other?

11:03.245 --> 11:04.205
Is something wrong?

11:04.622 --> 11:05.831
My apologies.

11:05.915 --> 11:09.168
The news about the murder at the castle
has put the miss here on edge.

11:09.251 --> 11:10.753
It is all over Thra.

11:11.212 --> 11:13.839
A Gelfling murdered this Mira.

11:14.173 --> 11:17.134
Thank the harvest,
we have the Skeksis to keep us safe.

11:17.218 --> 11:18.052
Yes.

11:18.135 --> 11:20.137
-But the Skeksis killed Mira!

11:20.221 --> 11:23.724
-Heresy!
-It is him! It's that Rian!

11:24.016 --> 11:26.602
I think it's time you were on your way.

11:26.686 --> 11:27.812
Yes, be gone!

11:30.106 --> 11:31.148
Safe travels.

11:35.277 --> 11:36.195
It's all right.

12:01.470 --> 12:02.763
We protect the lords.

12:03.806 --> 12:06.600
The lords protect the Crystal of Truth.

12:08.394 --> 12:09.520
All lies.

12:22.700 --> 12:23.993
The Podling squealed on me!

12:24.827 --> 12:26.245
Hi-yah!

12:46.974 --> 12:48.684
I know someone is there.

12:51.061 --> 12:52.354
Whoever you are,

12:52.897 --> 12:55.316
in the name of All-Maudra,
reveal yourself!

12:56.233 --> 12:57.109
Tavra?

12:57.485 --> 13:00.112
Uh...
I can explain!

13:01.781 --> 13:03.824
-Brea?
-Yes, I ran away.

13:03.908 --> 13:05.743
And yes, I know I'm in trouble...

13:06.035 --> 13:10.873
again, but I could not spend
an entire trine wearing silly hats

13:10.956 --> 13:13.876
and getting kicked in the face
by muddy Podlings!

13:14.251 --> 13:15.961
-You ran away?
-Yes.

13:16.462 --> 13:17.338
Good.

13:19.715 --> 13:21.258
Hey, easy now.

13:21.634 --> 13:22.468
Easy.

13:23.344 --> 13:25.805
- Good riddance!

13:27.765 --> 13:29.975
So, then Mother didn't send you?

13:31.727 --> 13:34.772
Does this mean
you're not here to take me back?

13:35.189 --> 13:36.190
Not at all.

13:38.234 --> 13:39.109
Brea...

13:40.778 --> 13:43.322
there's been a murder
at the Castle of the Crystal.

13:43.405 --> 13:44.824
A murder?

13:45.241 --> 13:48.369
A Stonewood guard named Rian
killed a Vapran and fled.

13:49.203 --> 13:51.080
Mother ordered me to find him.

13:52.081 --> 13:54.834
The clans have always been
mistrustful of each other, but...

13:56.168 --> 13:57.044
murder?

13:59.296 --> 14:00.965
Another dark sign.

14:03.133 --> 14:04.218
I saw something.

14:04.677 --> 14:06.136
-A vision!
- Oh?

14:06.512 --> 14:08.180
You get visions now?

14:09.056 --> 14:09.974
Yes.

14:11.433 --> 14:13.686
All right then. What did you see?

14:14.103 --> 14:15.062
A symbol.

14:15.521 --> 14:17.147
It looked like this... Um...

14:25.114 --> 14:25.990
This...

14:26.490 --> 14:27.992
sort of, and then...

14:28.534 --> 14:30.578
through here three times...

14:30.661 --> 14:31.954
and down.

14:33.831 --> 14:34.874
Hm...

14:41.547 --> 14:42.506
What does it mean?

14:44.508 --> 14:45.718
I don't know.

14:47.094 --> 14:49.221
But I made a deal with a Sifan soothsayer.

14:49.972 --> 14:52.182
-If I bring Onica the brightest--
-Onica?

14:52.349 --> 14:53.392
Uh-huh.

14:53.934 --> 14:56.020
If anyone catches you...

14:56.437 --> 14:58.480
Mother's too busy to notice anything.

14:59.315 --> 15:00.983
It's Seladon that's the problem.

15:01.066 --> 15:03.402
Ugh, Brea, I know Seladon can be--

15:03.485 --> 15:05.571
...colder than the Claw Mountains.

15:09.241 --> 15:11.827
-I don't like it when you do that.
-Do what?

15:11.911 --> 15:14.455
Stay quiet when I know you have
something to say.

15:14.538 --> 15:15.706
Out with it.

15:16.165 --> 15:19.835
Well, I was thinking that you and Seladon
are more alike than you realize.

15:20.002 --> 15:21.962
That's a mean thing to say.

15:22.046 --> 15:25.466
-Well, you're both very stubborn--
-She's the most stubborn!

15:28.510 --> 15:29.887
-Hm.

15:32.097 --> 15:33.766
If she and I are so similar,

15:33.849 --> 15:37.019
then why is it so much easier
to talk to you?

15:37.311 --> 15:38.395
That's simple.

15:39.313 --> 15:40.397
I'm fun.

15:43.651 --> 15:45.653
-Come here, little one.
-Aw.

15:48.280 --> 15:49.239
Remember,

15:50.074 --> 15:52.493
the bonds of sisterhood can be tested...

15:56.038 --> 15:57.498
but never broken.

16:03.337 --> 16:05.130
I love you, Tavra.

16:05.714 --> 16:07.174
I love you, Brea.

16:22.231 --> 16:25.317
- These houses are all so cute!

16:27.653 --> 16:30.698
Hello! Beautiful day we're having.

16:35.160 --> 16:36.996
- Good day! How are you?

16:39.039 --> 16:39.957
I see.

16:40.457 --> 16:42.042
Well, all right then.

16:42.418 --> 16:45.295
Look at that ladder!
I wonder where it goes.

16:46.005 --> 16:47.631
Oh! Oh, hi!

16:52.302 --> 16:53.512
-Hello!
-Huh?

16:54.513 --> 16:57.808
Deet, Hup not welcome Yotubi.

16:58.517 --> 17:00.185
-Blech!

17:00.269 --> 17:02.980
Stop it, Hup. They're just curious.

17:05.149 --> 17:06.859
Whoa! Look at that!

17:10.404 --> 17:13.699
I wonder what it’s for.
And why is it full of swords?

17:16.118 --> 17:17.119
Let's ask them!

17:17.494 --> 17:18.662
Oh!

17:19.163 --> 17:21.331
Not safe here, Stone-in-the-Wood.

17:21.415 --> 17:23.167
<i>Tintin </i>go Ha'rar.

17:24.126 --> 17:25.669
Come on, Hup.

17:25.878 --> 17:29.339
Don't you want to enjoy a nice,
refreshing Stonewood brew

17:29.423 --> 17:31.592
after a long day on the road?

17:32.426 --> 17:35.054
Hup... <i>uchi uchi</i> thirsty.

17:37.097 --> 17:39.058
And I said, "That's not my nebrie!"

17:45.647 --> 17:48.650
Oh, look at that filthy green Gelfling.

17:49.109 --> 17:51.070
Oh, she's disgusting!

18:01.705 --> 18:03.165
Oh...

18:06.168 --> 18:07.294
Ahh...

18:08.670 --> 18:10.214
Ah, there's a seat!

18:11.507 --> 18:12.424
Oh, oh!

18:12.508 --> 18:14.426
No, don't let her in.

18:14.760 --> 18:15.594
-What?
-Yeah.

18:16.095 --> 18:17.888
Excuse me. Sorry.

18:19.765 --> 18:21.266
-Tight squeeze.
-Oh!

18:24.061 --> 18:24.937
Hup?

18:25.312 --> 18:26.897
-Oh!

18:26.980 --> 18:28.732
- Come sit with us!
-Mm-mm!

18:29.358 --> 18:30.400
- Excuse me.

18:30.484 --> 18:32.277
What's that statue over there mean?

18:32.361 --> 18:34.655
-Huh?

18:35.739 --> 18:37.407
Do you hear something?

18:37.574 --> 18:39.743
No, but I smell something.

18:40.160 --> 18:41.703
-It's her.

18:41.787 --> 18:44.206
-Smells like wet Fizzgig.
-Yes.

18:44.414 --> 18:46.416
I'm not a Fizzgig. I'm Grottan.

18:46.500 --> 18:48.794
-Grottan! Didn't they die out?
- Ha!

18:48.877 --> 18:51.380
No! Who told you that?

18:51.839 --> 18:55.008
Go crawl back in the nest
you came from, you dirty Grottan!

18:58.137 --> 18:58.971
What?

18:59.054 --> 19:01.056
-Huh?

19:12.276 --> 19:13.443
Hup, watch out!

19:18.991 --> 19:20.617
Stop! Stop it!

19:24.163 --> 19:25.372
Stop it! Get away!

19:26.123 --> 19:27.916
- Ha!

19:37.217 --> 19:39.052
Ha!

19:40.637 --> 19:42.264
- Ah, Hup!

19:42.347 --> 19:44.141
-Hey, stop that!
- All right, enough!

19:44.224 --> 19:46.560
- Stop that right now!
-I said enough.

19:47.644 --> 19:50.189
-The Podling started it!
-That's a lie!

19:50.272 --> 19:52.941
Hup protect <i>aminya</i> Deet.
Rude Gelfling!

19:53.025 --> 19:55.861
A couple of days in the rascal hole
ought to teach you a lesson.

19:55.944 --> 19:57.905
-That's right.
-Wait, let me explain!

19:57.988 --> 19:59.489
Explain it to Maudra Fara.

20:00.240 --> 20:01.950
Podling <i>justista!</i>

20:03.744 --> 20:05.078
That showed them.

20:07.080 --> 20:10.959
Don't worry, Hup!
I'll get you out. I promise.

20:37.778 --> 20:39.571
Hmm...

20:44.910 --> 20:48.538
You're wasting your time.
I won't tell you anything.

20:48.830 --> 20:51.541
Not talk. Just listen.

20:52.251 --> 20:54.211
This peeper beetle,

20:54.294 --> 20:56.797
found only in Crystal Desert.

20:57.089 --> 20:59.049
Is something, yes?

20:59.883 --> 21:01.176
I've seen uglier.

21:01.260 --> 21:05.222
We keep starved.
Hungry beetle likes the soft meats.

21:05.305 --> 21:09.059
Favorite is round, wet eyes.

21:09.476 --> 21:13.146
Peeper beetle goes chomp, chomp, chomp!

21:13.605 --> 21:16.566
-Perfect for torturing Gelfling, huh?
-No!

21:16.858 --> 21:21.280
Never use on Gelfling,
only on Skeksis who misbehave.

21:21.530 --> 21:23.365
Did you hear screams last night?

21:23.448 --> 21:27.035
Friend Scientist was naughty,
so saw peeper beetle.

21:27.119 --> 21:28.120
Think, Gelfling.

21:28.578 --> 21:30.289
If Skeksis do that to Skeksis,

21:30.372 --> 21:33.542
imagine what Skeksis do
to Gelfling that will not talk.

21:33.625 --> 21:34.918
Hm?

21:35.168 --> 21:39.548
I am friend to Gelfling,
so tell where Rian is,

21:39.631 --> 21:43.468
or other Skeksis will make Gurjin scream
like Scientist.

21:43.885 --> 21:47.180
Tell Chamberlain where Rian is, please!

21:49.016 --> 21:50.642
-Never.

21:50.726 --> 21:53.520
Think on what friend says!

22:06.199 --> 22:07.993
Elder Cadia, welcome.

22:08.618 --> 22:10.871
-Hello.
-Yes, hello.

22:11.163 --> 22:12.372
Hello!

22:12.956 --> 22:14.875
It's even worse than I imagined.

22:14.958 --> 22:17.044
What a nice,
shiny palace you've got.

22:17.127 --> 22:18.420
Oh, Brea.

22:19.588 --> 22:21.006
- Hello.

22:21.089 --> 22:22.841
Guess I'm not getting in that way.

22:26.762 --> 22:27.804
This way!

22:27.888 --> 22:29.931
- Where are you taking me?

22:32.351 --> 22:35.062
Oh, not again.
What are you eating now?

22:35.145 --> 22:36.605
- Hm.

22:36.772 --> 22:38.357
Is someone there? Huh?

22:39.107 --> 22:42.027
Brea? Princess, what's the rush?

22:44.571 --> 22:47.657
Princess, shouldn't you be
with the Order of Lesser Service?

22:47.741 --> 22:50.285
-I ran away.
-You what? But why?

22:50.452 --> 22:51.328
Princess?

22:51.411 --> 22:55.248
Because I have to fetch the brightest
jewel from my mother's chamber!

22:55.332 --> 22:56.917
- Come back!
- No time to talk.

22:57.250 --> 22:59.961
Princess,
where are you going?

23:01.004 --> 23:03.298
I-- I don't understand.

23:03.715 --> 23:04.633
Wait!

23:04.925 --> 23:06.468
-Princess!

23:12.933 --> 23:14.643
Where'd she come from?

23:17.979 --> 23:19.898
Slow down! Slow down!

23:24.069 --> 23:25.695
What's her rush?

23:25.904 --> 23:27.697
Where's she flying off to?

23:29.449 --> 23:30.700
-Excuse me.

23:31.201 --> 23:32.035
Be careful!

23:40.001 --> 23:41.211
Oh, Brea.

23:42.337 --> 23:45.257
The tithing was especially stressful
this year,

23:45.632 --> 23:47.175
and I took it out on her.

23:47.717 --> 23:50.637
Cadia and his attendants
are waiting in the throne room.

23:50.720 --> 23:53.974
I sent Tavra on a dangerous mission.

23:54.433 --> 23:58.103
There's also a line of Gelfling
waiting to speak to you about the blight.

23:58.228 --> 24:01.690
Creatures going mad.
The murder of one of our clan.

24:01.815 --> 24:03.150
My daughters...

24:03.900 --> 24:04.734
gone.

24:05.527 --> 24:06.736
I'm here.

24:07.237 --> 24:08.530
I'm always here.

24:08.780 --> 24:10.907
You know what I mean, dear.

24:12.826 --> 24:13.785
Yes, Mother.

24:15.537 --> 24:18.415
I'll grant them all an audience tomorrow.

24:20.125 --> 24:21.084
Mother...

24:22.085 --> 24:23.753
you have always told me

24:23.837 --> 24:27.215
you are the All-Maudra first,
a mother second,

24:27.591 --> 24:32.053
just as I am a princess first,
a daughter second.

24:32.637 --> 24:36.141
If we allow matters of the heart
to distract us from our duties,

24:36.224 --> 24:40.145
then we have failed Thra.
We have failed the Skeksis.

24:40.562 --> 24:43.398
You and I are better than that.

24:47.194 --> 24:48.403
You're right.

24:51.531 --> 24:55.035
You will be a great All-Maudra someday,
Seladon.

24:56.745 --> 24:58.205
Duty calls.

25:02.209 --> 25:03.835
-Seladon?
-Yes, Mother?

25:03.919 --> 25:07.714
Straighten your wings.
You look like a lopsided unamoth.

25:09.758 --> 25:10.592
Yes, Mother.

25:24.856 --> 25:26.691
My journal.

25:32.656 --> 25:35.617
Now, let's see. The brightest jewel.

25:36.201 --> 25:38.620
Which one is the brightest jewel?

25:49.214 --> 25:50.882
The brightest jewel.

25:56.555 --> 25:59.474
Treacherous,
perfidious Skeksis!

26:00.475 --> 26:04.563
-Oh, soon... soon they will all see!

26:05.855 --> 26:09.317
How is friend skekTek? Good? Mm?

26:10.360 --> 26:14.197
Emperor is very displeased
that machine is not yet fixed.

26:15.657 --> 26:17.701
I urge patience.

26:17.784 --> 26:21.705
Explain your loss of eye slows you.

26:23.290 --> 26:25.792
My eye is better than ever!

26:26.293 --> 26:29.796
I require no further assistance
from you, skekSil.

26:29.879 --> 26:33.925
But if it wasn't for me,
Emperor would have taken more than eye.

26:34.009 --> 26:36.761
I want your machine to succeed, skekTek.

26:36.845 --> 26:40.348
I want what is best for all Skeksis.

26:40.724 --> 26:43.435
You must see that, yes?

26:43.518 --> 26:48.189
I do not have time for
your gormless distractions, you slippery--

26:48.273 --> 26:50.066
Huh?
Uh...

26:50.317 --> 26:51.943
What are those?

26:52.027 --> 26:53.737
Gruenaks.

26:54.446 --> 26:58.742
-These are gifts.
-But I thought we had eradicated them.

26:58.825 --> 27:02.245
These are survivors
found by Sifan mariners.

27:02.329 --> 27:04.372
- They are mechanically minded

27:04.456 --> 27:06.499
and surprisingly strong.

27:06.958 --> 27:09.252
You've sewn their mouths shut?

27:09.336 --> 27:12.672
-Mmm...

27:13.340 --> 27:16.217
Perfect for keeping secrets, yes?

27:17.344 --> 27:21.014
So, we are friends? All is forgiven?

27:21.348 --> 27:24.267
-It's a start.
-Mm...

27:30.357 --> 27:33.610
Step forward!
What's your business with the Maudra?

27:33.860 --> 27:38.156
-My name's Deet, I'm a Grottan--
-A Grottan? Aren't they all...

27:38.239 --> 27:41.826
No, we're very much alive,
and we don't sleep upside down.

27:41.910 --> 27:45.163
-And we smell just fine, most of the time.
-You what?

27:45.664 --> 27:47.874
I'm here to see Maudra Fara
on behalf of my friend Hup,

27:47.957 --> 27:49.668
who was unjustly thrown
into the rascal hole

27:49.751 --> 27:52.379
while defending my honor
against two very rude Gelfling.

27:52.462 --> 27:55.924
-He knocked me out of my chair...
-I need to speak to Maudra Fara.

27:56.549 --> 27:58.176
-Rian?
-She'll want to see me.

27:59.594 --> 28:00.470
Now.

28:00.970 --> 28:03.515
Fara needs to hear the truth
and release Hup immediately.

28:03.598 --> 28:07.060
No dirty Grottan's getting to see
the Maudra on my watch.

28:07.143 --> 28:09.020
-But...
- Follow me, Rian.

28:10.730 --> 28:14.150
He's much dirtier than me, just look.
Why does he get to go in?

28:14.901 --> 28:17.028
Because Rian is one of us!

28:17.445 --> 28:19.114
-Unlike you.

28:19.948 --> 28:22.367
- Step forward!

28:24.452 --> 28:25.662
Step forward!

28:28.581 --> 28:31.292
-What's your business with the Maudra?
- It's about Vivig.

28:31.376 --> 28:34.796
That's my Fizzgig.
Something's wrong with her. Her eyes...

28:42.470 --> 28:44.514
-Huh? Huh?
-Huh?

28:45.598 --> 28:47.142
Maudra Fara.

28:53.815 --> 28:57.235
Rian, guard to the Castle of the Crystal.

29:06.953 --> 29:08.037
Quiet, Baffi.

29:10.457 --> 29:12.083
-Maudra.
- Rian.

29:12.459 --> 29:17.046
Your return to Stone-in-the-Wood
puts our clan in a dangerous position.

29:17.547 --> 29:20.508
The Skeksis have declared you
a traitor to Thra.

29:20.592 --> 29:22.343
The Skeksis are the real traitors.

29:23.178 --> 29:24.679
They lied to us about everything.

29:24.763 --> 29:29.100
I will not tolerate heresy
from a murderer!

29:29.184 --> 29:30.810
I didn't murder Mira.

29:31.311 --> 29:32.604
The Skeksis did.

29:34.063 --> 29:36.900
This-- this is all that remains of Mira.

29:39.194 --> 29:41.988
She was kind and brave.

29:43.281 --> 29:44.491
And her laugh...

29:45.700 --> 29:46.868
She was full of life.

29:48.661 --> 29:50.663
But the Skeksis took that life.

29:51.873 --> 29:54.918
I watched them drain
and consume her very essence!

29:57.796 --> 29:58.880
You are my Maudra...

29:59.964 --> 30:01.883
and I've never seen you lose a fight.

30:02.675 --> 30:03.885
Dreamfast with me.

30:05.428 --> 30:06.805
Learn the truth,

30:07.472 --> 30:09.766
and together we can stop the Skeksis.

30:09.891 --> 30:10.892
You're right.

30:13.853 --> 30:17.232
-Your son is not well.

30:21.110 --> 30:21.986
Father?

30:22.904 --> 30:24.823
His condition is worse than I feared.

30:24.906 --> 30:27.575
I must return him
to the Castle of the Crystal at once.

30:27.659 --> 30:30.328
-No! Dreamfast with me and you'll see.
- No.

30:31.120 --> 30:34.332
The Skeksis have warned us
madness spreads this way.

30:35.250 --> 30:36.084
Rian...

30:37.335 --> 30:39.838
-you're very ill.
-I know what I saw.

30:39.921 --> 30:43.049
-They have Gurjin. He confessed.
-Gurjin?

30:44.008 --> 30:46.970
-He's alive?
-He said you killed Mira.

30:47.595 --> 30:50.723
Did you see Gurjin for yourself,
or is this what the Skeksis told you?

30:51.099 --> 30:53.810
The Skeksis have promised mercy.
Come back with me.

30:53.977 --> 30:56.896
Let them help, then everything
will go back to the way it was.

30:57.480 --> 30:58.439
Never!

30:58.857 --> 31:00.733
Listen to me, all of you.

31:02.735 --> 31:04.863
-The Skeksis are murderers!
-Enough, Rian!

31:04.946 --> 31:08.116
As your captain, I'm ordering you
to return with me to the castle.

31:08.199 --> 31:10.869
You are my father.
Why don't you ever believe me?

31:11.244 --> 31:12.161
Enough!
Escort Captain Ordon and his son

31:14.372 --> 31:16.374
back to the Castle of the Crystal.

31:20.503 --> 31:21.838
-No!
-Rian!

31:22.171 --> 31:23.506
-Get back.
-Don't! Calm down!

31:23.590 --> 31:25.466
Get back.

31:25.550 --> 31:26.384
Stop!

31:26.718 --> 31:27.552
Rian!

31:30.763 --> 31:32.265
-Rian, please!
-Back.

31:32.348 --> 31:33.725
Nobody else needs to get hurt.

31:38.438 --> 31:39.981
You're not going anywhere.

31:47.906 --> 31:49.741
- Watch out!

31:51.826 --> 31:52.911
- Huh?

32:00.168 --> 32:01.294
Careful!

32:03.838 --> 32:05.048
He's getting away!

32:07.175 --> 32:08.885
- Move!
- Rian!

32:20.396 --> 32:21.898
What do we do?

32:29.030 --> 32:31.324
- No! No, Rian!

32:41.334 --> 32:42.919
Where did he go?

32:47.256 --> 32:48.383
After him!

32:54.722 --> 32:55.765
Hm.

33:12.323 --> 33:13.616
Bah!

33:20.581 --> 33:23.626
Ah... Such sweet pain.

33:24.043 --> 33:25.628
Harder right there.

33:29.924 --> 33:32.844
-More flowers!
-Ah! Ah!

33:38.224 --> 33:39.267
Lovely.

33:39.350 --> 33:42.645
Oh, that's so marvelous upon the joints.

33:42.729 --> 33:45.231
Oh, totally.
Glob...

33:45.523 --> 33:46.983
Mm...

33:48.443 --> 33:51.320
Ah... beautiful.

33:52.030 --> 33:53.281
Skeksis?

33:53.364 --> 33:54.323
What?

33:54.532 --> 33:56.951
Where are you hiding yourselves?

33:57.035 --> 33:58.077
Huh?

33:58.703 --> 34:00.705
I recognize that voice.

34:01.456 --> 34:03.291
-It sounds like--
- Skeksis!

34:03.374 --> 34:05.960
It's her! It's her!

34:06.044 --> 34:08.087
Oh, no. It cannot be.

34:08.379 --> 34:11.632
<i>-</i>After so long?
-Yeah, she's as ugly as ever.

34:14.135 --> 34:15.678
It is her.

34:16.095 --> 34:18.848
It's... Aughra.

34:19.766 --> 34:21.559
I'm not decent.

34:21.768 --> 34:22.727
Pah!

34:22.810 --> 34:24.812
It has been many a trine.

34:25.521 --> 34:27.023
Hundreds of them.

34:27.648 --> 34:30.860
I see you've been enjoying yourselves
in my absence.

34:33.029 --> 34:35.656
-Get out, Podlings. Out! Go!

34:36.783 --> 34:38.659
Go! Out, Podling!

34:40.203 --> 34:42.205
-Hmm...

34:44.665 --> 34:47.126
No, get that out of there! Get it out!

34:48.628 --> 34:49.670
Pah!

34:50.004 --> 34:51.589
So little has changed.

34:51.672 --> 34:54.383
Oh, what are you doing? No! Stop it!

34:54.467 --> 34:56.344
-Stop it!
-Keep still.

34:57.970 --> 34:59.055
There we are.

35:00.807 --> 35:03.518
You appear unwell, Mother Aughra.

35:05.061 --> 35:06.854
Noticed, did you?

35:06.979 --> 35:10.191
I'm unwell because Thra is unwell.

35:10.274 --> 35:13.277
I've come to see the Crystal,
see what ails it.

35:13.361 --> 35:14.695
You are mistaken.

35:14.779 --> 35:16.906
The Crystal thrives,

35:17.281 --> 35:18.658
as does Thra.

35:18.741 --> 35:22.078
Aughra mistaken?
You speak but know nothing.

35:22.161 --> 35:24.622
Or is it you know and speak nothing?

35:24.914 --> 35:28.626
If the Crystal thrives,
why does my heart ache?

35:28.960 --> 35:31.295
Why does Thra call out in pain?

35:31.671 --> 35:35.550
Perhaps your interminable age
has finally caught up with you.

35:35.633 --> 35:38.219
You're ones to talk! Look at you.

35:38.511 --> 35:41.055
These are not the Skeksis
Aughra remembers.

35:41.139 --> 35:43.850
-Fat, shriveled, all at once!
-Ow! Ow! Cease! Cease!

35:44.392 --> 35:45.977
No, no, no, no, no!
Stop it!

35:46.185 --> 35:47.019
Stop it at once!

35:47.103 --> 35:48.604
-Bah!

35:48.813 --> 35:50.189
Show me the Crystal.

35:50.439 --> 35:53.568
The Crystal of Truth never lies.
Not to me.

35:53.943 --> 35:56.154
Not to Thra. It cannot.

35:56.237 --> 35:58.406
You have no right
to make demands upon us.

35:58.948 --> 36:01.075
-You abandoned the Crystal.

36:01.242 --> 36:03.828
We've protected it
this last thousand trine.

36:03.911 --> 36:08.082
We gave the poor creatures of Thra
order, innovation, and purpose.

36:08.166 --> 36:11.085
What have you done in all that time,
Mother Aughra?

36:11.169 --> 36:13.379
I journeyed among the stars and planets...

36:13.462 --> 36:14.922
- Ha!
-...that I may someday bring

36:15.006 --> 36:18.718
-their knowledge to Thra!
-So go back to your travels,

36:18.843 --> 36:22.763
then we can go back to caring
for the many you left behind.

36:22.847 --> 36:25.933
I am Mother Aughra! I am Thra!

36:26.017 --> 36:27.310
-No!

36:27.393 --> 36:30.521
Perhaps once, but no longer.

36:30.938 --> 36:33.149
Now<i> we </i>are Thra.

36:33.232 --> 36:36.068
I was a fool to entrust you
with the Crystal of Truth.

36:36.152 --> 36:39.739
You were well compensated.
You've got your precious orrery.

36:39.822 --> 36:42.450
-No!
-Return to it. Guards!

36:45.077 --> 36:48.789
Throw this useless old crone
out of our castle forever!

36:53.502 --> 36:54.545
Out of my way!

36:54.629 --> 36:55.630
Ha!

37:00.176 --> 37:04.764
Do you really think that's Mother Aughra?
She's a lot shorter than I expected.

37:04.847 --> 37:07.391
My grandfather told me
she cursed his village with ear mites

37:07.475 --> 37:09.393
because they forgot her birthday!

37:09.477 --> 37:13.147
I heard she sneezed
and a whole mountain crumbled.

37:13.522 --> 37:15.983
-It's all true.
-Hm?

37:16.567 --> 37:20.071
All and worse.
So you'll stay where you are,

37:20.571 --> 37:24.533
or you'll suffer the wrath
of all eight and a half fingers.

37:31.415 --> 37:32.667
Ninny wheelers.

37:33.417 --> 37:34.460
Ingrates.

37:34.752 --> 37:35.711
Huh?

37:38.214 --> 37:41.008
Skeksis think
they can take Crystal from me?

37:41.217 --> 37:42.051
Hmph!

37:42.343 --> 37:43.844
I am Crystal.

37:44.679 --> 37:46.222
The Crystal is Aughra.

38:03.698 --> 38:04.865
Oh, no.

38:05.616 --> 38:08.703
No, no, no, no, no, no!

38:09.245 --> 38:11.080
This cannot be!

38:11.956 --> 38:13.165
Look at you!

38:13.958 --> 38:16.627
My beautiful Crystal of Truth.

38:17.211 --> 38:18.587
My heart!

38:20.631 --> 38:24.510
The Skeksis made you sick.
Aughra must heal you.

38:25.594 --> 38:28.055
-But how?

38:31.267 --> 38:32.476
What is this?

38:33.019 --> 38:35.771
It's me, but not me now.

38:36.522 --> 38:40.151
<i>I am you when we last saw the Crystal,</i>

38:40.276 --> 38:43.779
<i>before our eyes turned to the stars.</i>

38:44.655 --> 38:47.575
What have the Skeksis done to the Crystal?

38:48.659 --> 38:49.535
To us?

38:49.994 --> 38:53.205
<i>The moment Skeksis possessed the Crystal,</i>
<i>they abused it.</i>

38:53.873 --> 38:57.168
<i>-Their corruption created the Darkening.</i>

38:57.251 --> 39:00.254
<i>Now, the Crystal has nothing left to give,</i>

39:00.338 --> 39:03.382
<i>so the Skeksis abuse grows.</i>

39:04.425 --> 39:08.054
<i>And the Skeksis can take</i>
<i>that which is not given.</i>

39:08.554 --> 39:09.513
<i>Look.</i>

39:11.515 --> 39:15.019
<i>-No!</i>
<i>-Give the Crystal everything!</i>

39:15.102 --> 39:17.897
<i>Give it your very essence! </i>

39:20.649 --> 39:22.943
<i>Here is the answer we seek!</i>

39:23.027 --> 39:25.738
<i>Here is life everlasting!</i>

39:25.821 --> 39:28.074
No, no! Stop!<i> </i>Stop!

39:28.157 --> 39:30.951
<i>Gelfling return to Thra when they die.</i>

39:31.786 --> 39:33.871
<i>That is the natural order.</i>

39:34.538 --> 39:37.625
<i>But when Skeksis consume essence, </i>

39:37.958 --> 39:41.087
<i>the Gelfling cannot return home.</i>

39:41.545 --> 39:43.547
<i>Thra is out of balance, </i>

39:43.839 --> 39:46.384
<i>thus the Darkening spreads faster.</i>

39:46.467 --> 39:47.968
What do we do?<i> </i>

39:48.469 --> 39:51.222
How do I make this right? Tell me!

39:51.305 --> 39:54.642
<i>I see many endings lain before us,</i>

39:54.975 --> 39:58.270
<i>diverging paths through an endless forest.</i>

39:58.521 --> 40:00.439
<i>Some good, most bad.</i>

40:01.816 --> 40:04.276
<i>You must guide destiny.</i>

40:04.777 --> 40:05.736
<i>Shape it.</i>

40:06.612 --> 40:08.781
Why can I not see these paths?

40:08.864 --> 40:11.534
<i>You have lost the song of Thra.</i>

40:11.826 --> 40:13.119
<i>Find the song.</i>

40:13.202 --> 40:16.330
<i>Change the future before it's too late.</i>

40:20.459 --> 40:21.669
Hm!

40:32.638 --> 40:35.433
Don't worry, Hup.
I'll get you out of that rascal hole.

40:41.939 --> 40:43.232
Maybe not this way.

41:00.541 --> 41:03.961
I don't know what you are,
but you better not come any closer.

41:11.927 --> 41:13.137
Ooh!

41:13.679 --> 41:14.597
Hello.

41:17.141 --> 41:18.267
You're not so scary.

41:19.185 --> 41:20.936
I like your pretty neck.

41:21.353 --> 41:23.022
-Are you hungry?

41:23.898 --> 41:25.691
-Here.

41:28.944 --> 41:30.696
It's good. Trust me.

41:36.577 --> 41:37.661
Told you.

41:52.259 --> 41:53.636
Hm?

42:05.564 --> 42:06.815
Ah...

42:08.400 --> 42:10.110
You're all one.

42:12.029 --> 42:13.739
- Curse you!

42:18.369 --> 42:19.370
Hm?

42:21.372 --> 42:24.124
Ah, for the love of Thra, light!

42:27.586 --> 42:30.673
Oh, come on, I just need a spark.

42:30.756 --> 42:31.840
-Light!
-Excuse me.

42:34.885 --> 42:37.972
-Stay back!
-I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you.

42:38.055 --> 42:40.558
I thought you might need some help
with your fire.

42:40.641 --> 42:43.435
Who sent you? Maudra Fara? Huh?

42:43.519 --> 42:45.729
-My father?
- Maudra Argot.

42:45.813 --> 42:48.524
Although, technically,
it was the Sanctuary Tree that gifted me

42:48.607 --> 42:51.360
with the vision of a coming disaster
that's going to destroy us all.

42:51.694 --> 42:54.113
But it was Maudra Argot that said
I needed to leave the caves.

42:54.196 --> 42:55.197
Oh.

42:55.489 --> 42:57.783
Hey! Aren't you that Gelfling
from Stone-in-the-Wood

42:57.866 --> 42:59.952
who cut ahead of me
in line to see the Maudra?

43:00.286 --> 43:02.246
Well, yes.

43:03.998 --> 43:05.499
-I'm sorry.
-That's all right.

43:05.583 --> 43:07.293
I know how you can make it up to me.

43:07.459 --> 43:09.962
My friend, Hup, is locked up
in the rascal hole.

43:10.045 --> 43:12.298
But if you can get me in
to see the Stonewood Maudra...

43:12.381 --> 43:15.092
No. I can't help you.

43:15.426 --> 43:17.052
My clan has cast me out.

43:21.557 --> 43:22.600
-May I?
-Hm?

43:23.058 --> 43:24.727
Uh... sure.

43:27.813 --> 43:29.982
But it won't light. The ground's too wet.

43:30.357 --> 43:31.650
We'll see about that.

43:41.160 --> 43:42.244
Hm...

43:42.661 --> 43:45.039
-Impressive.
-Old Grottan trick.

43:45.122 --> 43:45.998
Huh.

43:49.209 --> 43:50.210
I'm Deet, by the way.

43:51.045 --> 43:51.920
I'm Rian.

43:52.421 --> 43:53.881
Nice to meet you, Rian.

43:53.964 --> 43:56.675
You're... not scared of me?

43:57.843 --> 43:58.927
I don't think so.

43:59.720 --> 44:00.638
Should I be?

44:02.473 --> 44:04.350
Seems like every other Gelfling is.

44:05.142 --> 44:06.810
They think that I'm a monster.

44:07.561 --> 44:09.647
They're all too scared to see the truth,

44:10.230 --> 44:12.066
even when it's right in front of them.

44:14.068 --> 44:16.820
Well, I don't think you're a monster.

44:17.404 --> 44:19.365
That's it! Monsters!

44:19.448 --> 44:21.575
-What?
-I know exactly what to do now!

44:21.659 --> 44:23.994
You've been so helpful. Thanks so much!

44:24.662 --> 44:27.039
- Wait!
-No time! I have to rescue my friend.

44:27.414 --> 44:30.250
-Good luck with everything.
-Uh... Good luck to you!

44:31.043 --> 44:32.252
Oh...

44:46.016 --> 44:47.017
Hm...

44:51.814 --> 44:53.524
Oh... I'm too late.

44:55.651 --> 44:56.527
- Hello.

44:56.985 --> 44:58.028
Elder Cadia!

44:58.278 --> 44:59.655
Do I know you?

45:00.030 --> 45:03.659
Princess Brea, just in time.
We sail with the tide.

45:03.742 --> 45:08.372
Cadia, please make sure the last runes
are packed and ready for transport.

45:08.455 --> 45:10.833
Of course, my Elder Onica.

45:11.917 --> 45:15.129
Where did I leave those runes?
And what are runes?

45:15.254 --> 45:17.047
-Elder Onica?

45:17.381 --> 45:20.634
I served as Cadia's apprentice
for many trine.

45:20.759 --> 45:23.595
His recent... memory loss

45:23.679 --> 45:27.015
allowed me to give myself
a long overdue promotion.

45:28.100 --> 45:29.893
Did you bring what I asked?

45:30.144 --> 45:31.311
Oh! Yes.

45:32.896 --> 45:34.982
The brightest jewel
in my mother's chamber.

45:35.482 --> 45:37.109
Hm... clever.

45:38.360 --> 45:41.947
Now, you have your payment.
Tell me more about my symbol.

45:42.364 --> 45:43.282
Payment?

45:43.741 --> 45:44.867
Of course.

45:45.409 --> 45:48.495
-Sifa never do anything for free.
-Apparently not!

45:48.579 --> 45:49.455
Ugh!

45:49.538 --> 45:53.667
The chrysalis isn't payment.
It's the answer!

45:54.501 --> 45:55.335
Oh...

45:56.253 --> 45:57.671
I don't understand.

45:58.088 --> 45:59.840
A great many things.

46:00.424 --> 46:03.594
You see another bauble
hung high on a wall.

46:04.094 --> 46:07.681
This is the chrysalis
of an imperial unamoth,

46:07.973 --> 46:10.726
-the totem animal of your clan.
-Huh?

46:25.824 --> 46:28.744
Now, ask your question.

46:30.579 --> 46:32.790
Ask... the moth?

46:34.500 --> 46:38.253
How can one Gelfling know so much
and so little all at once?

46:39.546 --> 46:40.506
Uh...

46:45.052 --> 46:48.180
Where are the answers I seek?

47:08.784 --> 47:10.202
It's beautiful.

47:13.539 --> 47:14.623
Onica,

47:15.165 --> 47:16.500
I'm in your debt.

47:17.084 --> 47:19.044
Time to run, Princess.

47:19.586 --> 47:21.088
Yes, I...
Oh!

47:22.297 --> 47:23.131
Thank you.

47:23.841 --> 47:24.842
Goodbye.

48:22.649 --> 48:23.901
-Hello?
