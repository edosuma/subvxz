<i>- If somebody</i>

<i>that I'd be downstairs</i>
<i>sleeping in the living room</i>

25:09.409 --> 25:11.810

<i>after everything</i>
<i>I went through in Iraq,</i>

I would tell them
they were full of [bleep].

25:18.418 --> 25:20.852
<i>- So I'm laying on the bed</i>
<i>reading a magazine.</i>

25:20.888 --> 25:23.822
[thudding]

25:23.857 --> 25:26.558
Next thing I hear,
"thump, thump, thump."

25:26.593 --> 25:28.326
<i>I'm wondering.</i>
<i>I'm like, "Is that footsteps?</i>

Don't see anybody

25:56.523 --> 25:58.290

26:17.177 --> 26:19.210
I heard a noise
in the hallway.

26:24.952 --> 26:28.520
It felt like something

this weird scream from upstairs.

26:46.673 --> 26:48.340
- What was that?
- I don't know.

26:48.375 --> 26:50.709
- I've never been

26:50.744 --> 26:53.645
<i>I look back over,</i>

thump, thump, thump."

27:02.255 --> 27:03.688
It's Kevin hauling
downstairs.

27:03.724 --> 27:05.190
- What's wrong?
- [whimpers]

27:05.225 --> 27:06.624
- Buddy, tell us
what happened.

27:06.660 --> 27:07.959

<i>I don't know</i>

27:09.563 --> 27:10.962

27:10.998 --> 27:12.297
<i>"Dude, what the heck happened?"</i>

- Are you sure
that's what you saw?

27:17.170 --> 27:18.803
- Yes, Heather!

27:18.839 --> 27:22.140
- Kevin's not a "show
my emotions on my sleeve"

27:28.215 --> 27:29.514

crying with fear.

27:33.687 --> 27:34.753
- Something in his room.

27:38.725 --> 27:40.492

I'm chasing a shadow.

28:52.799 --> 28:56.601
- Just gonna get some
blankets and stuff for Kevin.

28:56.636 --> 28:58.336

<i>[ominous music]</i>

29:07.047 --> 29:10.648

29:10.684 --> 29:12.650

sound like,

29:12.686 --> 29:14.119
and those were footsteps.

29:14.154 --> 29:16.654
<i>I need to know,</i>
<i>for my own sanity,</i>

<i>- Then I hear</i>
<i>this little tap sound.</i>

30:06.139 --> 30:08.806

30:14.447 --> 30:17.549
<i>And then I notice</i>

30:17.584 --> 30:19.184
<i>a word on the window.</i>

<i>[ominous music]</i>

30:22.222 --> 30:23.755
<i>¶ ¶</i>

30:31.631 --> 30:34.432
<i>[ominous music]</i>
.

30:34.467 --> 30:36.434
- [whispering] "Zozo."

30:36.469 --> 30:40.104
<i>¶ ¶</i>

30:40.140 --> 30:41.873
<i>- I kept wiping</i>
<i>and then realized</i>

30:41.908 --> 30:44.609
that the word was written
on the outside of the window.

30:46.613 --> 30:48.413
<i>Pretty impossible,</i>

30:48.448 --> 30:52.317
<i>especially since that window</i>
<i>was on the second story.</i>

30:52.352 --> 30:54.319
After seeing the world
that was on Caitlyn's window,

30:54.354 --> 30:55.687
<i>I needed to find out</i>
<i>what it meant.</i>

30:58.992 --> 31:01.960
<i>[dramatic music]</i>

31:01.995 --> 31:04.829
<i>¶ ¶</i>

31:04.864 --> 31:08.433
I found a book called
the "Dictionnaire Infernal."

31:08.468 --> 31:11.836
<i>It was an encyclopedia written</i>
<i>in the mid-19th century,</i>

31:11.871 --> 31:14.038
<i>kind of a textbook</i>
<i>for demons.</i>

<i>[ominous music]</i>

31:21.748 --> 31:23.948
<i>¶ ¶</i>

31:23.984 --> 31:27.452
And then that's
when I saw its name.

31:27.487 --> 31:29.420
<i>It turned out to be</i>
<i>a demon.</i>

31:29.456 --> 31:35.226
<i>¶ ¶</i>

31:35.261 --> 31:38.563
- Heather.
Come here.

31:38.598 --> 31:40.632
I got to show you
something.

31:42.636 --> 31:45.536
<i>- It brings ill will.</i>

31:45.572 --> 31:48.306
<i>It brings bad luck.</i>

31:48.341 --> 31:50.274
<i>It brings death.</i>

31:50.310 --> 31:52.944
It brings suicide.

31:52.979 --> 31:56.280
<i>And it has a traumatic impact</i>
<i>on your family.</i>

31:56.316 --> 31:58.049
- No.

31:58.084 --> 32:01.119
- I started to get scared
for our safety at that point.

32:01.154 --> 32:03.087
- At heart, I am a soldier.

32:03.123 --> 32:04.422
<i>I like to confront issues,</i>

32:04.457 --> 32:06.658
<i>resolve them</i>
<i>to the best of my abilities.</i>

32:06.693 --> 32:09.227
<i>I wanted to ask it to get out</i>
<i>of the house, you know,</i>

32:09.262 --> 32:11.262
<i>just go somewhere else.</i>

32:11.297 --> 32:13.998
<i>I found out it's heavily</i>
<i>affiliated with Ouija boards.</i>

32:14.034 --> 32:16.401
<i>I realize</i>
<i>that the Ouija board</i>

32:16.436 --> 32:18.403
was the most effective tool
to communicate with them.

32:18.438 --> 32:19.737
- What are we gonna do?

32:23.209 --> 32:25.243
- I'm gonna find a way
to get rid of this thing.

32:25.278 --> 32:30.281
<i>¶ ¶</i>

32:30.316 --> 32:32.583
- We had to do something.
We were getting desperate.

32:32.619 --> 32:35.353
<i>So that evening,</i>
<i>we made a Ouija board.</i>

32:35.388 --> 32:43.294
<i>¶ ¶</i>

33:05.151 --> 33:07.418
- In the name
of Jesus Christ,

33:07.454 --> 33:09.787
we ask for your protection
from evil.

33:09.823 --> 33:14.659
Let nothing but light, goodness,
and love surround us this day.

33:16.262 --> 33:17.995
Okay.
Let's do this.

33:18.031 --> 33:20.431
- [sighs]

33:20.467 --> 33:23.701
<i>- We all put one finger apiece</i>
<i>on a shot glass.</i>

33:26.039 --> 33:29.006
<i>[tense music]</i>

33:29.042 --> 33:34.712
<i>¶ ¶</i>

33:34.748 --> 33:36.447

33:39.552 --> 33:41.385
- The first couple of minutes,
nothing happened.

33:41.421 --> 33:44.522
<i>¶ ¶</i>

33:44.557 --> 33:45.957
- What was that?

33:45.992 --> 33:47.725
- And then a really cold breeze
hit the room.

<i>¶ ¶</i>

33:53.633 --> 33:56.100
<i>[scary music]</i>

34:01.508 --> 34:02.874
<i>I looked around the table,</i>
<i>and I was like...</i>

34:02.909 --> 34:04.242
- Who's doing this?

34:04.277 --> 34:05.476
- It's not me.

34:05.512 --> 34:06.611
- Kevin?

34:06.646 --> 34:07.578
- Nope.

34:10.183 --> 34:12.416
<i>¶ ¶</i>

34:12.452 --> 34:16.220
<i>- It started going</i>
<i>"Yes, no, yes, no,"</i>

34:16.256 --> 34:17.922
back and forth,
back and forth.

34:21.561 --> 34:25.296
- I was so shocked.
My heart was pounding.

34:26.766 --> 34:29.033
- What do you want?

34:29.068 --> 34:31.335
- Garry started to ask
questions--"Who are you?"

34:31.371 --> 34:32.503
- Why are you here?

34:32.539 --> 34:34.372
- "Can you leave?"

34:34.407 --> 34:36.707
- What's your name?

34:45.251 --> 34:47.118
<i>- The glass started</i>
<i>to move,</i>

34:47.153 --> 34:50.588
and it spelled out Z...

<i>¶ ¶</i>

34:57.964 --> 34:59.797

34:59.833 --> 35:01.432
<i>- And it just kept doing it.</i>

35:01.467 --> 35:02.967
<i>It just kept going</i>
<i>back and forth.</i>

35:03.002 --> 35:05.703
There's obviously got to be
something here.

35:05.738 --> 35:07.438
<i>We're not alone.</i>

35:07.473 --> 35:09.607
<i>- I asked...</i>
- What do you want?

35:10.944 --> 35:17.582
- And it spelled out quickly
K-I-L-L.

35:17.617 --> 35:19.483
<i>- And that was a shock.</i>
<i>I was like, "Kill?</i>

35:19.519 --> 35:22.186
Kill why?
Kill who?"

35:22.222 --> 35:26.057
<i>And it started to spell out</i>
<i>G...</i>

This can't be real.

38:28.374 --> 38:29.507
- [whispering]
Look at the mirror.

38:29.542 --> 38:31.575
<i>- Something was moving</i>

38:31.611 --> 38:36.213
A big, black
demonic figure.

38:36.249 --> 38:38.983
I felt like I was gonna
have a heart attack.

What are you guys looking at?

38:40.686 --> 38:42.219
I can't see anything.

38:46.426 --> 38:49.727
- And I just see
this big, huge shadow form.

38:49.762 --> 38:51.062
<i>- And his response was...</i>

38:51.097 --> 38:53.497
- Oh, my God.
What the hell is that?

38:53.533 --> 38:56.734
- And that damn thing
slowly turned its head

38:56.769 --> 38:59.236

towards us.

- We got to go.

39:27.367 --> 39:28.866

39:28.902 --> 39:30.501

come charging down the steps.

39:30.537 --> 39:32.170
[all talking at once]

39:32.205 --> 39:34.205

To hell with this [bleep].

I was ready to fight.
