02:14.300 --> 02:19.100
Then I didn't choose that one
because it was gonna give me pimples,

02:19.000 --> 02:21.500
so I choosed another scary one

02:21.600 --> 02:26.500
because, for all those years
that I went for Halloween,

02:26.600 --> 02:28.300
I wasn't scary at all.

02:36.800 --> 02:40.900
I love baseball.
It's my destiny to play that game.

02:41.000 --> 02:42.900
I don't really care about winning.

02:43.000 --> 02:47.300
Well, like, now I do
'cause, like, we've lost every game.

02:47.400 --> 02:49.200
I've gotten tired of it.

02:49.400 --> 02:52.700
I'm working, like, so hard.
All the balls are getting thrown to me.

02:52.800 --> 02:55.100
I'm trying to catch, like, every one.

02:55.300 --> 02:59.200
All of the people in the outfield
are all looking around and...

02:59.300 --> 03:01.800
Come on!
Let's play some baseball, okay?

03:02.000 --> 03:03.200
Not the lazy game.

03:11.200 --> 03:12.500
They're here.

03:18.100 --> 03:19.200
Lewis?

03:20.700 --> 03:22.300
Lewis?

03:31.300 --> 03:33.600
Goob! Hey, I did it, Goob! I finished it!

03:33.700 --> 03:35.200
They are gonna love this!

03:35.300 --> 03:38.100
Nothing says "adopt me"
like a weird invention.

03:38.200 --> 03:39.300
Lewis!

03:39.400 --> 03:41.400
- Lewis, the Harringtons are here!
- Way ahead of you, Mildred.

03:41.600 --> 03:43.300
Wait! Wait! Wait, wait, wait.

03:43.400 --> 03:46.400
Remember, sit up straight.
Look them in the eye.

03:46.500 --> 03:48.600
Smile. Let's fix your...

03:49.200 --> 03:50.500
Mildred.

03:50.900 --> 03:52.900
All right, all right, all right, all right.

03:53.000 --> 03:54.800
Go show them how special you are.

03:55.100 --> 03:56.800
Oh, I hope this is it.

03:56.900 --> 03:58.500
I hope he gets adopted.

03:58.700 --> 04:00.200
You and me both, chief.

04:01.800 --> 04:04.500
I mean, there's so many things
in the world that can be improved.

04:04.600 --> 04:07.800
Just think of it.
Moving sidewalks, flying cars.

04:07.900 --> 04:09.400
The possibilities are endless.

04:09.500 --> 04:11.500
Flying cars? Yeah, that's a good one.

04:11.700 --> 04:14.400
All it takes is some imagination
and a little science,

04:14.500 --> 04:16.800
and we can make the world
a better place.

04:16.899 --> 04:20.000
Well, these are all interesting ideas.

04:20.200 --> 04:22.100
So, what's your favourite sport?

04:22.200 --> 04:24.600
- Well, does inventing count as a sport?
- Actually...

04:24.700 --> 04:26.700
'Cause I think I hit a home run
with this one!

04:26.900 --> 04:29.200
- What is that?
- First, a question.

04:29.300 --> 04:31.500
What's the number one problem
that you face

04:31.600 --> 04:33.200
when you make
a peanut butter and jelly sandwich?

04:33.400 --> 04:35.600
- Lewis, I don't think we...
- Portion control.

04:35.800 --> 04:37.600
Too much peanut butter sticks
to the roof of your mouth,

04:37.800 --> 04:38.800
takes forever to chew.

04:38.900 --> 04:42.500
Too much jelly squishes out the sides
and makes your hands all sticky.

04:42.500 --> 04:45.000
Well, I propose
that the perfect P.B. and J.

04:45.200 --> 04:46.400
is within mankind's grasp,

04:46.600 --> 04:48.800
and I've built this machine to achieve it.

04:48.900 --> 04:51.000
For this demonstration,
I'll use regular bread.

04:51.100 --> 04:52.200
Honey, it's okay.

04:52.300 --> 04:54.000
As you can see, toasting is an option.

04:54.200 --> 04:56.200
We don't usually eat peanut butter.

04:56.700 --> 04:59.000
Lewis, this is really not necessary.

04:59.200 --> 05:00.800
It's jammed!

05:02.600 --> 05:04.300
Lewis, please, don't!

05:13.000 --> 05:14.000
What's happening?

05:14.100 --> 05:16.800
Mr Harrington has a peanut allergy!

05:17.300 --> 05:18.600
I'm sorry!

05:18.700 --> 05:20.200
Here let me help you get that off!

05:20.300 --> 05:22.000
Stand back!

05:25.000 --> 05:27.500
- Is he gonna be okay?
- Breathe. Breathe.

05:27.700 --> 05:29.500
I'm so sorry! I didn't know!

05:29.700 --> 05:31.200
It was really nice to meet you.

05:31.400 --> 05:34.000
We're gonna need some time
to think about it.

05:34.200 --> 05:36.200
Hi, folks. Everything all...

05:36.400 --> 05:37.400
What happened?

05:37.500 --> 05:39.900
Miss Duffy,
that boy is definitely not right for us.

05:40.000 --> 05:41.300
Now, if you'll excuse me.

05:41.500 --> 05:45.300
I'm so sorry about this.
If you would just...

05:53.700 --> 05:56.300
- I made some lunch.
- Not hungry.

05:58.600 --> 05:59.600
Poor Mr Harrington.

05:59.700 --> 06:03.100
- I killed him?
- No. No! No, you didn't kill him.

06:03.300 --> 06:05.100
I called. He's perfectly fine.

06:06.500 --> 06:08.400
I was just gonna say that it's...

06:08.600 --> 06:10.200
It's too bad
he didn't get to try a sandwich

06:10.300 --> 06:12.700
from that wonderful invention of yours.

06:12.900 --> 06:14.800
- Yeah, real wonderful.
- It's not you.

06:15.000 --> 06:17.400
We just haven't found
the right couple yet.

06:17.500 --> 06:19.300
One hundred twenty-four.

06:19.900 --> 06:20.900
What?

06:21.000 --> 06:24.300
That's how many adoption interviews
I've had, 124.

06:24.500 --> 06:25.500
Oh, Lewis, come on, now.

06:25.600 --> 06:27.800
You're exaggerating just to make your

06:29.400 --> 06:30.400
point.

06:30.500 --> 06:32.400
Plus, I'm gonna be 13 next year,

06:32.600 --> 06:35.900
and you know how hard it is
for a teenager to get adopted.

06:36.100 --> 06:39.400
I have no future. No one wants me.

06:39.600 --> 06:40.600
That's not true, Lewis!

06:40.700 --> 06:42.300
My own mother didn't even want me.

06:42.400 --> 06:44.700
Now, stop it. You do not know that.

06:44.800 --> 06:46.100
Then why'd she give me up?

06:46.300 --> 06:47.800
She may not have been able
to take care of you.

06:48.000 --> 06:49.400
Did you ever think of that?

06:50.300 --> 06:54.100
I am sure that she was only thinking
about what was best for you.

06:55.000 --> 06:56.300
I never thought of it that way.

06:56.400 --> 06:59.500
Maybe she wanted to keep you,
but she had no choice.

07:00.800 --> 07:02.300
You're right.

07:02.600 --> 07:05.900
My real mom is the only person
who's ever wanted me.

07:06.100 --> 07:07.700
Wait. I said "maybe."

07:07.900 --> 07:10.500
And if she wanted me then,
she'll want me now.

07:10.600 --> 07:12.000
What are you talking about?

07:12.100 --> 07:15.300
I have to find her, Mildred,
and when I do, she'll take me back,

07:15.500 --> 07:16.800
and we'll be a family again!

07:16.900 --> 07:20.500
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Lewis, you can't do that.

07:20.700 --> 07:23.300
No one knows anything about her.
No one even saw her.

07:24.600 --> 07:27.000
Wrong. I saw her

07:27.100 --> 07:28.200
once.

07:28.500 --> 07:31.800
She's in here. I just have to remember.

07:35.600 --> 07:36.600
That's it!

07:39.500 --> 07:41.200
<i>Hello</i>

07:41.300 --> 07:44.000
<i>I got something to tell you</i>

07:44.200 --> 07:47.500
<i>But it's crazy</i>

07:47.600 --> 07:50.900
<i>I got something to show you</i>

07:51.000 --> 07:54.300
<i>So give me just one more chance</i>

07:54.400 --> 07:58.400
<i>One more glance
And I will make of you</i>

07:58.800 --> 08:01.900
<i>Another believer</i>

08:02.000 --> 08:06.900
<i>Guess what?
You got more than you bargained</i>

08:07.100 --> 08:10.000
<i>Ain't it crazy?</i>

08:10.100 --> 08:13.600
<i>You got more than you paid for</i>

08:13.700 --> 08:16.900
<i>So give me just one more chance</i>

08:17.000 --> 08:19.500
<i>One more glance</i>

08:19.600 --> 08:24.400
<i>One more hand to hold</i>

08:24.600 --> 08:31.100
<i>You've been on my mind</i>

08:31.200 --> 08:34.600
<i>Though it may seem I'm fooling</i>

08:34.700 --> 08:41.000
<i>Wasted so much time</i>

08:41.100 --> 08:45.500
<i>Though it may seem I'm fooling</i>

08:45.800 --> 08:47.900
<i>What are we gonna do?</i>

08:48.000 --> 08:50.600
<i>What are we gonna do?</i>

08:50.700 --> 08:54.400
<i>What are we gonna do about it?</i>

08:54.600 --> 09:01.000
<i>You've been on my mind</i>

09:01.100 --> 09:04.400
<i>One more chance</i>

09:04.500 --> 09:09.500
<i>Wasted so much time</i>

09:11.200 --> 09:13.800
<i>One more chance</i>

09:15.700 --> 09:17.000
So tired.

09:18.000 --> 09:22.200
We'll see you at 2:00 this afternoon.
He'll be so excited you're coming.

09:22.300 --> 09:23.500
Bye-bye, now.

09:23.700 --> 09:27.100
Yes! Hey, Goob... I mean, Michael.

09:27.200 --> 09:29.200
- Good luck at the big game today.
- Easy win.

09:29.300 --> 09:31.300
Those guys are a bunch of bums.

09:31.400 --> 09:33.400
I just hope I can stay awake.

09:33.500 --> 09:35.300
Don't tell me. Let me guess.

09:35.300 --> 09:38.900
He was up all night
working on his stupid project,

09:39.600 --> 09:40.700
but that's what happens

09:40.800 --> 09:43.900
when you get a science geek
for a roommate.

09:50.300 --> 09:51.900
Ah, that's good joe.

09:53.300 --> 09:56.100
All right, Einstein,
you owe Michael big time.

09:56.200 --> 09:59.100
Well, unlocking the secrets of the brain
took a lot longer than I expected,

09:59.200 --> 10:02.200
but it's finished, Mildred.
I recalibrated the headset.

10:03.300 --> 10:04.800
Now the neural circuits will connect.

10:05.000 --> 10:06.800
I've cracked the hippocampus!

10:06.900 --> 10:08.700
Really? Okay. What?

10:08.800 --> 10:10.500
Now to test it out.

10:12.400 --> 10:15.200
Oh, no! I'm late! I gotta go!

10:15.300 --> 10:16.300
Wait a minute, Lewis. Wait a minute.

10:16.400 --> 10:17.900
I almost forgot what I came up here for.

10:18.100 --> 10:19.400
I know you have a lot
on your plate today,

10:19.500 --> 10:21.700
but I've scheduled an interview for you
this afternoon.

10:21.800 --> 10:23.600
- No, thanks.
- "No, thanks"?

10:23.900 --> 10:25.600
Sweetheart, this is
about being adopted,

10:25.800 --> 10:28.600
and you will be back here
clean, happy and on time.

10:28.800 --> 10:32.400
I'm done with interviews, Mildred.
I'm not gonna be rejected anymore.

10:32.500 --> 10:34.700
Listen, I know where your head is,
but I'm telling you,

10:34.900 --> 10:38.400
you have got to get out of the past
and look to the future.

10:38.500 --> 10:40.400
I am, and this is it.

10:40.500 --> 10:41.600
This is my future.

10:42.800 --> 10:44.100
I'm sorry.

10:44.800 --> 10:46.500
Lewis? Honey?

10:50.800 --> 10:53.300
Dr Krunklehorn,
I know you're very busy there

10:53.500 --> 10:54.500
at Inventco Labs,

10:54.600 --> 10:56.500
and we're just so excited
to have you as a judge.

10:56.600 --> 10:58.400
It's my pleasure, Mr Willerstein.
Hey, you never know.

10:58.600 --> 11:00.500
One of your students may invent
the next integrated circuit

11:00.700 --> 11:02.600
or microprocessor or integrated circuit.

11:02.700 --> 11:04.100
Oh, wait! I said that already.

11:04.200 --> 11:05.900
Well, I just don't get out
of that lab very much.

11:06.100 --> 11:08.000
Is that a bow tie? I like bow ties.

11:08.100 --> 11:10.000
I haven't slept in eight days!

11:10.100 --> 11:12.700
Well, then can I get you a cot
or something?

11:12.800 --> 11:15.700
Nope, I've got the caffeine patch.
It's my invention.

11:15.800 --> 11:18.300
Each patch is the equivalent
of 12 cups of coffee.

11:18.500 --> 11:20.800
You can stay awake for days
with no side effects.

11:21.900 --> 11:22.900
Sorry. Who's this?

11:23.000 --> 11:25.500
This is one of our students,
Stanley Pukowski.

11:26.100 --> 11:27.200
Oh, so cute!

11:27.300 --> 11:29.600
I just want to bite
his chubby little cheeks!

11:32.100 --> 11:33.800
What's with the dress, Pukowski?

11:34.100 --> 11:36.500
It's actually a toga, sir.

11:36.600 --> 11:39.900
Coach, nice to see you, sort of.
What are you doing here?

11:40.100 --> 11:42.400
Judging a science fair.
What's it look like I'm doing?

11:42.600 --> 11:45.400
And what makes you qualified
to judge a science fair?

11:45.600 --> 11:46.700
It's my gym.

11:47.900 --> 11:49.200
Stanley. Volcano.

11:49.400 --> 11:54.600
Behold the awesome power
of Mount Vesuvius!

11:57.300 --> 12:00.500
The toggle switch isn't toggling.

12:00.700 --> 12:01.700
Dr Krunklehorn?

12:01.800 --> 12:03.700
Barium, cobalt, Einstein, Kool-Aid!

12:03.800 --> 12:07.600
I don't know what she just said,
but this project is unacceptable!

12:07.700 --> 12:09.300
Now, give me 20 laps around the gym!

12:09.500 --> 12:10.900
Move it! Move it! Move it! Go! Go! Go!

12:11.000 --> 12:12.600
- Coach!
- I'm watching you.

12:20.700 --> 12:24.600
Okay, next up is Lizzy
and her fire ant farm.

12:24.800 --> 12:25.900
That's right.

12:26.000 --> 12:27.400
Lizzy, we talked about the fire ants.

12:27.500 --> 12:29.300
You know that they have a tendency
to bite people.

12:29.400 --> 12:31.600
Only my enemies.

12:32.700 --> 12:34.800
Just keep moving, shall we?
Top notch, Lizzy!

12:34.900 --> 12:37.600
Let's not anger her
or make her jumpy in any way.

12:50.800 --> 12:52.700
This area's not secure. Get in.

12:53.200 --> 12:56.300
Have you been approached
by a tall man in a bowler hat?

12:56.300 --> 12:58.400
- What?
- Hey, hey, I'll ask the questions here.

12:58.500 --> 13:00.900
- Okay, goodbye.
- All right,

13:01.100 --> 13:03.000
didn't want to pull rank on you,
but you forced my hand.

13:03.100 --> 13:05.200
Special Agent Wilbur Robinson
of the T.C.T.F.

13:05.300 --> 13:07.300
- The what?
- Time Continuum Task Force.

13:07.400 --> 13:08.500
- I'm here to protect you.
- Well...

13:08.600 --> 13:10.900
Now, tall man, bowler hat,
approached you?

13:11.100 --> 13:12.100
No, why?

13:12.700 --> 13:14.500
I could lose my badge for this.

13:14.600 --> 13:16.200
He's a suspect in a robbery.

13:16.400 --> 13:17.400
What did he steal?

13:17.500 --> 13:18.800
- A time machine.
- A what?

13:18.900 --> 13:21.900
I've tracked him to this time,
and my informants say he's after you.

13:22.000 --> 13:23.600
Me? Why me?

13:23.700 --> 13:25.600
The boys back at HQ
haven't figured out a motive yet.

13:25.700 --> 13:27.600
And by "HQ," I mean "headquarters."

13:27.700 --> 13:29.000
I know what HQ means.

13:29.100 --> 13:30.600
Good. You're a smart kid.

13:30.700 --> 13:32.700
That might keep you alive, for now.

13:32.800 --> 13:34.300
Just worry
about your little science gizmo

13:34.400 --> 13:36.400
and leave the "perp" to me.

13:36.600 --> 13:39.200
- And by "perp," I mean...
- I know what it means!

13:39.300 --> 13:41.200
Okay, Mr Smarty-pants.

13:44.500 --> 13:46.700
Bowler Hat Guy!

13:50.200 --> 13:51.500
My frogs!

13:51.600 --> 13:52.800
You're not gonna get away with it,

13:53.800 --> 13:56.500
kid with science project.

13:56.700 --> 13:59.200
Dude, you almost busted
my solar system!

14:00.500 --> 14:02.800
My frogs! They're getting away!

14:32.600 --> 14:34.900
Got you! That's the last of them.

14:35.000 --> 14:37.200
Annoying little girl,
I don't have time for this.

14:37.400 --> 14:38.400
I'm on a very important...

14:38.500 --> 14:41.600
Don't sass me, boy. I know karate.

14:41.700 --> 14:44.600
Come on, Pukowski! Feel the pain!
Love the pain!

14:44.800 --> 14:45.800
Coach...

14:46.000 --> 14:47.000
Next up is Lewis.

14:47.200 --> 14:49.200
Yes... Lewis! Excuse me.

14:49.800 --> 14:51.600
Lewis, tell me this thing is not gonna...

14:52.400 --> 14:56.200
It's okay. It's gonna work this time.
I won't let you down, I promise.

14:56.300 --> 14:59.100
All right, Lewis, I trust you.
Knock 'em dead.

14:59.600 --> 15:02.400
That was a figure of speech.
Please don't kill anyone.

15:06.800 --> 15:08.600
Okay, stand back, everybody.

15:08.700 --> 15:11.300
This next project
will knock your socks off.

15:11.900 --> 15:14.000
Seriously, you might wanna stand back
a little.

15:15.600 --> 15:17.100
Have you ever forgotten something,

15:17.200 --> 15:20.600
and no matter how hard you tried,
you couldn't remember it?

15:21.200 --> 15:24.500
Well, what happens
to these forgotten memories?

15:24.600 --> 15:27.900
I propose
they're stored somewhere in your brain,

15:28.000 --> 15:30.500
and I built a machine
that can retrieve them.

15:30.600 --> 15:33.400
I call it the Memory Scanner.

15:34.000 --> 15:35.600
It's shiny!

15:35.700 --> 15:38.300
So, Lewis,
how does the Memory Scanner work?

15:38.300 --> 15:41.500
First, you input the desired period
of time on this keypad.

15:42.000 --> 15:45.800
Then a laser scans the cerebral cortex,
where memories are stored.

15:45.900 --> 15:48.300
The retrieved memory
is then displayed on this monitor.

15:48.400 --> 15:50.200
Wrap him up. I'll take two.

15:50.400 --> 15:53.800
Now, I'm going back 12 years,
three months and 11 days.

15:53.900 --> 15:55.700
Why that particular day?

15:55.900 --> 15:57.700
You didn't think
I was paying attention, did you?

15:58.900 --> 16:01.400
Well, that was the day...

16:03.100 --> 16:05.300
Let's just say, that was
a very important day in my life.

16:05.500 --> 16:06.900
Fair enough. Play ball.

16:08.000 --> 16:10.400
It'll just take a second
to get the turbines going.

16:28.100 --> 16:29.900
Lewis, wait!

16:40.000 --> 16:42.200
She's gonna blow!

16:43.800 --> 16:45.200
Watch out!

16:49.200 --> 16:51.000
Feel the pain! Love the...

16:51.200 --> 16:53.100
Hurts so much! Make it stop!

16:58.700 --> 16:59.900
Make it stop!

17:00.000 --> 17:01.300
Coach, suck it up, okay?

17:01.400 --> 17:04.700
Let us conduct ourselves in a way
that we'll all be proud of tomorrow.

17:04.800 --> 17:06.500
- Let's calm down!
- Mr Willerstein?

17:06.700 --> 17:08.200
- I didn't mean to...
- Not now, Lewis!

17:08.300 --> 17:10.800
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

17:11.099 --> 17:12.400
Not now.

17:13.500 --> 17:16.400
Okay, and we are walking
in a calm, orderly fashion

17:16.500 --> 17:17.500
toward the exits.

17:21.900 --> 17:23.300
Wait, Lewis!

17:41.200 --> 17:44.000
Come, my dear. Our future awaits.

19:02.000 --> 19:04.500
Hey, what are you doing up here?

19:18.900 --> 19:21.500
Would you quit that, please?
I know you're not a pigeon.

19:22.300 --> 19:23.900
You're blowing my cover.

19:24.000 --> 19:25.500
We're the only ones up here.

19:25.600 --> 19:27.500
That's just what they want you to think.

19:27.600 --> 19:29.100
Now, enough moping.

19:29.300 --> 19:32.000
Take this back to the science fair
and fix that Memory Scanner.

19:32.200 --> 19:34.000
Stop! Stop! Get away from me!

19:34.100 --> 19:35.100
Maybe you've forgotten.

19:35.200 --> 19:37.600
I'm a time cop from the future,
should be taken very seriously.

19:38.500 --> 19:39.800
That's no badge.

19:40.000 --> 19:43.100
This is a coupon for a tanning salon!
You're a fake.

19:43.300 --> 19:45.300
Okay, you got me. I'm not a cop,

19:45.400 --> 19:47.300
but I really am from the future,

19:47.400 --> 19:49.300
and there really is this Bowler Hat Guy.

19:49.400 --> 19:50.500
Here we go again.

19:50.700 --> 19:52.500
He stole a time machine,
came to the science fair

19:52.600 --> 19:53.700
and ruined your project.

19:53.800 --> 19:56.000
My project didn't work
because I'm no good.

19:56.100 --> 19:58.500
There is no Bowler Hat Guy,
there is no time machine,

19:58.600 --> 20:00.100
and you're not from the future!

20:00.300 --> 20:01.300
You're crazy!

20:01.900 --> 20:03.100
I am not crazy.

20:03.200 --> 20:05.500
Oh, yeah, Captain Time Travel?
Prove it.

20:07.000 --> 20:08.800
Yeah, that's what I thought.

20:09.900 --> 20:11.600
I'm just gonna go lock myself
in my room

20:11.800 --> 20:13.600
and hide under the covers
for a couple years.

20:13.700 --> 20:16.900
If I prove to you I'm from the future,
will you go back to the science fair?

20:17.000 --> 20:19.100
Yeah, sure, whatever you say.

20:19.600 --> 20:21.100
Hey, let go of me!

20:21.200 --> 20:23.200
- What are you doing? Let go of me!
- Okay.

20:42.400 --> 20:44.700
What is this? Where are we going?

20:45.100 --> 20:47.000
To the future!

21:06.600 --> 21:08.700
<i>The future has arrived</i>

21:09.900 --> 21:12.300
<i>The future has arrived today</i>

21:13.000 --> 21:14.700
<i>The future has arrived</i>

21:15.800 --> 21:18.400
<i>The future has arrived today</i>

21:58.100 --> 21:59.100
Is this proof enough for you?

21:59.100 --> 22:00.600
Is it ever!

22:00.800 --> 22:03.600
I never thought that time travel
could be possible in my lifetime,

22:03.900 --> 22:06.200
and here it is, right in front of me!

22:06.300 --> 22:08.000
The truth will set you free, brother.

22:08.100 --> 22:10.900
This is beyond anything
I could've imagined.

22:11.600 --> 22:13.700
This means
I could really change my life.

22:13.900 --> 22:15.200
That's right. You can.

22:15.300 --> 22:17.500
Next stop, science fair,
to fix your Memory Scanner.

22:17.700 --> 22:20.300
Hey, I'm not gonna fix
that stupid Memory Scanner.

22:21.300 --> 22:23.800
- What?
- Wilbur, this is a time machine!

22:24.000 --> 22:25.600
Why should I fix my dumb invention

22:25.700 --> 22:29.000
when you can take me
to see my mom now in this ship?

22:30.600 --> 22:34.500
I could actually go back to that night
and stop her from giving me up.

22:34.700 --> 22:37.400
The answer is not a time machine.
It's this.

22:37.500 --> 22:39.700
This? You want to know
what I think about this?

22:39.900 --> 22:40.900
What are you doing?

22:41.100 --> 22:42.200
I'm sorry, Wilbur,

22:42.300 --> 22:44.100
but you don't know
what I've lived through.

22:44.200 --> 22:45.900
- Lewis, no!
- Let go!

22:46.000 --> 22:47.800
- You let go!
- You're not the boss of me!

22:48.000 --> 22:51.000
Yes, I am, 'cause you're 12, and I'm 13.

22:51.100 --> 22:52.400
That makes me older.

22:52.600 --> 22:53.600
Well, I was born in the past,

22:53.700 --> 22:55.700
which makes me older
and the boss of you!

23:13.000 --> 23:15.000
I am so dead.

23:16.400 --> 23:18.900
I'm not allowed to look at this thing,
let alone drive it!

23:18.900 --> 23:20.200
Mom and Dad are gonna kill me,

23:20.400 --> 23:23.000
and I can tell you this.
It will not be done with mercy.

23:23.100 --> 23:24.700
Isn't there like
a time machine repair shop

23:24.800 --> 23:25.800
- or something?
- No!

23:26.000 --> 23:27.900
There's only two time machines
in existence,

23:28.100 --> 23:29.800
and the Bowler Hat Guy
has the other one!

23:29.900 --> 23:32.300
Well, somebody's gonna have
to fix this.

23:32.600 --> 23:35.300
Good idea. You're smart. You fix it.

23:35.400 --> 23:37.700
Are you crazy? I can't fix this thing.

23:37.900 --> 23:40.300
Yes, you can. You broke it. You fix it.

23:41.500 --> 23:43.400
All right, under one condition.

23:43.700 --> 23:46.300
I fix it,
you take me back to see my mom.

23:46.500 --> 23:49.200
What? You didn't even follow through
on our last deal.

23:49.400 --> 23:50.400
How can I trust you?

23:50.500 --> 23:53.100
Well, you told me you were a time cop
from the future.

23:53.300 --> 23:54.900
How can I trust you?

23:55.500 --> 23:56.600
<i>Touché.</i>

23:58.500 --> 24:00.200
So do we have a deal?

24:30.500 --> 24:31.800
Good day, madam.

24:31.900 --> 24:35.200
- I'm here to change the future.
- Yes, sir?

24:35.300 --> 24:39.000
I must speak with the man
in charge immediately.

24:39.100 --> 24:42.200
- Yes, sir.
- I have an appointment with destiny.

24:42.400 --> 24:44.000
Very good, sir. I'll let Smith know,

24:44.100 --> 24:46.200
and I'll have your dry cleaning
delivered directly to your suite.

24:46.300 --> 24:48.300
- What?
- Now, what time is your appointment?

24:50.100 --> 24:52.100
- Are you talking to me?
- Yes.

24:52.300 --> 24:53.800
What time is your appointment?

24:56.800 --> 24:59.100
Big hand is on the... Oh, 2:00!

24:59.200 --> 25:00.800
You're the 2:00?

25:01.500 --> 25:02.800
Yes. Yes, I am.

25:03.000 --> 25:04.600
You're Mary Johnson?

25:05.100 --> 25:07.000
Yes.

25:07.500 --> 25:09.600
Mary is short for...

25:10.700 --> 25:11.700
Marian?

25:12.500 --> 25:14.500
- Can that be a boy name?
- Yes.

25:14.900 --> 25:17.000
- Then yes.
- Have a seat.

25:17.200 --> 25:18.500
Oh, goody!

25:27.000 --> 25:32.600
"Pass off invention as my own." Check.
Oh, I love checklists.

25:32.600 --> 25:34.200
The board is ready to see you now.

25:35.200 --> 25:37.500
Wait. What am I going to say?

25:38.500 --> 25:40.400
I'm never gonna remember that.

25:40.600 --> 25:43.700
Would you... Why don't you go?
You do it so much better than me.

25:44.900 --> 25:46.000
That's true.

25:46.100 --> 25:48.700
A hat without a head
couldn't really pass off an invention

25:48.800 --> 25:49.800
as its own.

25:51.200 --> 25:55.000
Fantastic! Great idea!
I'm so glad I have you!

26:00.400 --> 26:04.300
"Prepare to be amazed." Oh, I got it!

26:05.200 --> 26:08.200
Prepare to be amazed!

26:08.900 --> 26:13.100
"This is my invention."

26:13.200 --> 26:17.100
"I doubt any of you have seen
anything as brilliant as this device."

26:17.300 --> 26:18.300
Very well,

26:18.700 --> 26:20.400
Miss Johnson?

26:21.000 --> 26:22.400
It's Ms.

26:22.500 --> 26:25.000
You have two minutes. Please begin.

26:29.500 --> 26:31.700
- It's shiny!
- What is that thing?

26:31.800 --> 26:36.200
Well, I like to call it my...

26:36.200 --> 26:38.100
To call it my...

26:38.200 --> 26:42.200
- What are you looking at?
- No! I... The sun, in my eyes.

26:42.200 --> 26:43.900
Well, then let me close the blinds.

26:49.300 --> 26:51.200
Now, the name?

26:51.800 --> 26:53.200
Well, what...

26:53.400 --> 26:55.000
We can quibble about names
at a later date.

26:55.100 --> 26:57.700
The point is,
what I have here is special, unique.

26:57.900 --> 27:01.000
Yes. Yes, you must love it
and buy it and mass produce it,

27:01.200 --> 27:04.900
and the best part is,
it's got really comfy headphones.

27:09.300 --> 27:12.000
I wonder, could you lean forward
just a little bit, please?

27:12.100 --> 27:13.800
Yes, thank you.

27:13.900 --> 27:16.400
Yes, they are quite comfortable.

27:16.800 --> 27:18.900
What do you hope
to accomplish with this?

27:19.000 --> 27:20.600
Oh, nothing of consequence.

27:20.700 --> 27:25.200
I simply wish to crush the dreams
of a poor little orphan boy!

27:26.000 --> 27:28.700
After that, it's all a little fuzzy.

27:28.900 --> 27:30.500
You mean,
you haven't thought this through?

27:31.500 --> 27:32.700
Thirty seconds.

27:37.300 --> 27:38.800
Allow me to show you how it works.

27:38.900 --> 27:40.900
First, we turn it on.

27:43.600 --> 27:45.600
That's not it.

27:47.400 --> 27:48.400
Ten seconds.

28:06.700 --> 28:08.600
So where do I sign?

28:21.900 --> 28:24.300
Doris, it's all over.

28:24.400 --> 28:26.300
All our hopes and dreams dashed,

28:26.400 --> 28:29.900
like so many pieces
of a broken machiney thing.

28:30.600 --> 28:31.800
You're right.

28:32.000 --> 28:35.600
Success is still ours for the taking.

28:37.600 --> 28:39.700
We must find that boy.

28:43.900 --> 28:46.900
We'll sneak this thing into the garage.
You'll have all the tools you need.

28:47.000 --> 28:48.000
What about your parents?

28:48.200 --> 28:49.200
Mom never goes in there,

28:49.400 --> 28:51.300
and Dad's on a business trip
until tomorrow morning.

28:51.500 --> 28:52.500
You've got till then to fix it.

28:52.600 --> 28:55.600
Well, fine, but I'm gonna need
some blueprints or something for this.

28:55.700 --> 28:57.900
No worries. I got someone
who could help us with that.

29:00.500 --> 29:03.500
<i>Who dares to disturb my sanctuary?</i>

29:03.600 --> 29:05.600
Carl, it's me. Let me in.

29:05.700 --> 29:08.700
<i>None may enter
unless they speak the royal password.</i>

29:08.900 --> 29:11.200
Carl, what are you talking about?
We don't have a password.

29:11.200 --> 29:14.400
<i>Yes, we do.
I made one up while you were gone.</i>

29:14.500 --> 29:16.500
Well, then
how am I supposed to know what it is?

29:16.700 --> 29:17.900
<i>You...</i>

29:19.100 --> 29:20.600
<i>Good point.</i>

29:22.700 --> 29:24.500
Welcome back, little buddy.

29:24.700 --> 29:27.100
So what's up
with the stolen time machine?

29:27.200 --> 29:29.600
Did you find it? Apparently not,

29:29.800 --> 29:32.300
and you managed
to bust this one as well.

29:32.400 --> 29:33.900
It'll be fixed before Dad gets home.

29:34.000 --> 29:36.400
And how do you suppose
that's gonna...

29:36.600 --> 29:38.500
- Who's that?
- Wow, a real robot!

29:38.700 --> 29:39.700
Hi, I'm Lewis.

29:45.900 --> 29:47.900
Well, that was unexpected.

29:48.500 --> 29:50.000
As was that.

29:50.100 --> 29:52.500
If my family finds out
I brought you from the past,

29:52.600 --> 29:54.600
they'll bury me alive
and dance on my grave.

29:54.700 --> 29:57.600
I'm not exaggerating.
Well, yes, I am, but not the point.

29:57.800 --> 29:59.900
The point is,
your hair's a dead giveaway.

30:00.000 --> 30:01.600
Why would my hair be
a dead giveaway?

30:01.800 --> 30:03.400
That is an excellent question.

30:03.400 --> 30:04.800
Wait! Where are you going?

30:05.000 --> 30:06.300
Another excellent question.

30:08.000 --> 30:09.700
But I don't just want to sit here.

30:10.200 --> 30:11.200
Stay.

30:11.400 --> 30:12.400
But...

30:27.200 --> 30:28.700
Wow!

30:34.600 --> 30:35.800
Hey, ring my doorbell.

30:36.100 --> 30:37.200
No, no, no, no, ring my doorbell.

30:37.400 --> 30:39.300
Ring it. Ring it. Ring it.
Look at this door bell. Ring it.

30:41.000 --> 30:43.300
- Yes!
- That was accidental.

30:43.400 --> 30:44.800
That's an accidental ring.
It doesn't count.

30:45.000 --> 30:46.000
It's in the rule book. Look it up.

30:46.200 --> 30:47.500
- Flat head.
- Short roots.

30:47.700 --> 30:48.700
Evergreen.

30:54.400 --> 30:55.900
What do you mean,
don't go to the family?

30:56.000 --> 30:59.500
How can we not go to the family
in this time of family crisis?

30:59.700 --> 31:03.200
By leaving the garage door unlocked,
you let the time machine get stolen,

31:03.300 --> 31:06.100
and now the entire time stream
could be altered!

31:06.200 --> 31:07.800
That and someone took my bike.

31:07.900 --> 31:10.500
Look, I told you. It's gonna all work out.

31:10.700 --> 31:13.200
First, we keep Lewis in the garage,
away from everybody.

31:13.300 --> 31:15.100
I show up and give him
the pep talk of the century.

31:15.300 --> 31:16.600
Then he fixes the time machine.

31:16.800 --> 31:18.400
Why is it an acorn?

31:18.600 --> 31:20.200
I didn't have time to sculpt everything.

31:20.300 --> 31:22.200
Okay, now, the time machine is fixed.

31:22.400 --> 31:23.900
His confidence in inventing is restored.

31:24.000 --> 31:26.400
He goes back to the science fair,
fixes his Memory Scanner,

31:26.500 --> 31:28.300
thus restoring
the space-time continuum.

31:28.500 --> 31:30.100
What about taking him back
to see his mom?

31:30.300 --> 31:32.000
I just told him that to buy some time.

31:32.100 --> 31:35.300
Oh, yeah, can't see that one
blowing up in your face.

31:35.500 --> 31:37.100
Trust me. I got it under control.

31:37.200 --> 31:39.100
Wilbur Robinson never fails.

31:41.200 --> 31:42.900
But on the slight chance that I do...

31:43.000 --> 31:46.000
"On the slight chance," yeah.
You know what? I'll run the numbers.

31:49.600 --> 31:50.800
What is it?

31:51.000 --> 31:52.600
Well, it's not...

31:52.700 --> 31:57.600
It doesn't pertain to anything in...
You know, there's not necessarily...

31:57.700 --> 32:02.400
There's a 99.999999% chance
that you won't exist.

32:02.700 --> 32:05.700
- What?
- And I didn't want to tell you, but I did.

32:05.900 --> 32:07.200
I won't exist?

32:07.300 --> 32:08.700
And where does that leave me?

32:08.900 --> 32:11.000
Alone, rusting in a corner.

32:13.100 --> 32:15.800
What am I worried about?
Now, blueprints?

32:18.700 --> 32:22.500
If this thing ever blows over,
I really gotta get away from you

32:22.600 --> 32:23.900
and get some quiet time.

32:27.200 --> 32:28.200
What's...

32:29.000 --> 32:30.500
Well, hey, there, little fella!

32:30.600 --> 32:34.200
Now, I know what you're thinking,
and my clothes are not on backwards.

32:34.300 --> 32:35.800
My head is!

32:37.200 --> 32:39.900
Oh, I used to tell that one
to my science students.

32:40.900 --> 32:42.400
They didn't laugh, either.

32:42.600 --> 32:44.500
Anywho, what's your name, fruit-head?

32:44.600 --> 32:46.600
- Well, Lewis, but...
- Lewis, huh?

32:46.700 --> 32:49.700
Well, say, Lewis, you haven't seen
any teeth around here, have you?

32:49.800 --> 32:51.300
- Teeth?
- Yeah, my teeth.

32:52.100 --> 32:54.900
Been digging holes all day.
Can't find them anywhere.

32:55.000 --> 32:57.100
All right, look, old man,
I need to get back to the garage.

32:57.200 --> 32:58.200
Wilbur left me down there,

32:58.400 --> 32:59.600
and I wasn't supposed to leave,
and these monsters...

32:59.700 --> 33:00.700
- Monsters?
... attacked me on the porch and...

33:00.800 --> 33:02.600
There's no monsters on the porch,
you ninny.

33:02.800 --> 33:04.200
- Listen to me!
- Of course, I also didn't think

33:04.400 --> 33:05.900
there was a woodchuck
living on my arm,

33:06.000 --> 33:07.400
and lookie there!

33:07.600 --> 33:08.600
Hope he ain't got rabies.

33:08.700 --> 33:10.700
Old man, I need to get to the garage!

33:10.900 --> 33:14.600
Well, sure, I'll get you there in a jiffy.
I know a shortcut.

33:14.700 --> 33:16.600
Welcome to the garage.

33:17.500 --> 33:18.700
Well, I'm completely lost.

33:18.800 --> 33:19.800
Hiya, Grandpa.

33:20.000 --> 33:21.000
Hey, Aunt Billie.

33:21.100 --> 33:22.600
Lewis and me
are looking for the garage.

33:22.700 --> 33:24.900
- We have a garage?
- Apparently so.

33:25.000 --> 33:27.200
Lewis, will you give me a hand
and time my race?

33:27.300 --> 33:31.000
Okay, Gaston,
my toy train's ready for you.

33:32.500 --> 33:34.200
That's a toy train?

33:36.100 --> 33:40.000
On your mark, get set, go?

33:43.600 --> 33:45.800
- 3.7 seconds.
- I win!

33:47.400 --> 33:49.300
Okay, Lewis, I got the blueprints.

33:50.500 --> 33:51.600
Lewis?

33:51.900 --> 33:54.600
<i>- And five and six and seven and eight.
- That's Uncle Joe. He works out.</i>

33:54.700 --> 33:55.700
<i>Keep those tummies tucked.</i>

33:57.400 --> 33:58.800
This isn't the garage.

33:58.900 --> 33:59.900
I know.

34:00.200 --> 34:02.300
I don't think
the garage is in here, either.

34:02.400 --> 34:04.900
Egads! A very grave matter, indeed.

34:05.000 --> 34:07.500
- That's Uncle Art.
- A real superhero?

34:07.600 --> 34:09.400
Quad Four, Alpha Omega Galaxy,

34:09.600 --> 34:11.699
needs a large
cheese-and-sausage thin-crust?

34:11.900 --> 34:15.100
I'll be there in 30 minutes, or it's free.

34:15.800 --> 34:17.800
- He's a...
- Pizza delivery guy.

34:17.900 --> 34:19.199
Lewis?

34:19.600 --> 34:22.100
- What are we doing up here?
- Looking for the garage.

34:22.199 --> 34:23.800
Oh, yeah!

34:30.500 --> 34:34.100
Laszlo, you stop painting my hat,
or I'm telling Ma!

34:34.100 --> 34:36.300
- Lighten up, sis!
- Lasz, I mean it!

34:36.600 --> 34:39.600
Children, please!
Your mother is trying to take a nap.

34:39.800 --> 34:41.600
What is all the yelling out here?

34:41.800 --> 34:42.900
- He started it!
- She started it!

34:43.000 --> 34:44.300
I don't want to hear any more!

34:44.400 --> 34:47.699
- Now, sweetie...
- Don't you "sweetie" me!

34:48.100 --> 34:50.000
I'm going for a drive!

34:53.600 --> 34:56.000
That's strange.
She usually takes the Harley.

34:56.199 --> 34:57.800
Lewis!

34:58.000 --> 35:00.500
I think my wife Lucille's baking cookies.

35:02.000 --> 35:04.100
Bake them cookies, Lucille!

35:04.200 --> 35:05.500
Why is your dog wearing glasses?

35:05.600 --> 35:08.500
Oh, 'cause his insurance
won't pay for contacts.

35:08.700 --> 35:11.300
That's Uncle Spike,
and there's Uncle Dimitri.

35:12.400 --> 35:14.700
- Oh, look, there's...
- That's the monster!

35:14.800 --> 35:17.500
Oh, no, Lewis, that's our butler, Lefty.

35:18.800 --> 35:20.000
Nice to meet you.

35:20.200 --> 35:22.300
Hey, Lefty,
any idea how to get to the garage?

35:23.400 --> 35:25.700
Well, that's true. We didn't ask her yet.

35:25.800 --> 35:27.800
- Who?
- Wilbur's mom, Franny.

35:28.000 --> 35:29.500
I think you'll like her.

35:33.600 --> 35:34.900
Hey, guys!

35:35.200 --> 35:39.300
<i>You ask me over
And over and over</i>

35:39.400 --> 35:42.300
<i>Have you seen
My peacock-feathered hat?</i>

35:42.400 --> 35:43.500
Frogs?

35:43.600 --> 35:45.000
Taught them everything they know.

35:45.200 --> 35:48.000
- Franny, this is Lewis.
- Nice to meet you, ma'am.

35:48.100 --> 35:51.500
Perfect timing.
We need someone on maracas.

35:52.100 --> 35:55.800
<i>Where is your heart at?
Nobody knows that</i>

35:55.900 --> 35:57.900
<i>Even though you've him, her, me</i>

35:58.100 --> 36:00.500
<i>And an army searching</i>

36:02.500 --> 36:06.000
<i>I've got a feeling
You will be reeling</i>

36:06.100 --> 36:09.600
<i>When you are bad
And the circus comes to town</i>

36:09.700 --> 36:11.300
Grandpa, I think I found your teeth.

36:11.500 --> 36:13.200
<i>And you see me leaving
Dressed up as a magician</i>

36:13.300 --> 36:14.400
<i>Or something like that</i>

36:15.800 --> 36:18.600
Sarsaparilla! My teeth are back!

36:18.800 --> 36:20.000
Ring-a-ding-ding.

36:25.700 --> 36:26.800
All right!

36:26.900 --> 36:29.900
Right. Well, glad I could help
with the teeth,

36:29.900 --> 36:32.200
but, wow, look at the time.

36:34.500 --> 36:36.500
Lewis, I told you to stay in the garage!

36:36.700 --> 36:38.700
I did, but I went up the tube,
and I ran into your family, and I...

36:39.800 --> 36:41.200
You met my family?

36:44.000 --> 36:45.100
Pop quiz.

36:45.200 --> 36:46.600
Who have you met,
and what have you learnt?

36:46.700 --> 36:48.600
Okay. Bud, Fritz and Joe are brothers.

36:48.800 --> 36:51.000
Fritz is married to Petunia, and is she...

36:51.100 --> 36:52.200
Cranky? Yes.

36:52.300 --> 36:53.700
<i>Tallulah and Laszlo are their children.</i>

36:53.800 --> 36:55.700
<i>Joe is married to Billie.
Lefty is the butler.</i>

36:55.800 --> 36:56.900
<i>Spike and Dimitri are twins,</i>

36:57.000 --> 36:58.700
and I don't know who they're related to.

36:58.800 --> 36:59.800
Neither do we. Go on.

36:59.900 --> 37:03.200
Lucille is married to Bud,
and your dad, Cornelius, is their son.

37:03.600 --> 37:05.700
What does Cornelius look like?

37:05.700 --> 37:07.100
Tom Selleck.

37:08.400 --> 37:12.100
Okay, Cornelius is married to Franny,
and her brothers are Gaston and Art.

37:12.200 --> 37:13.300
You're forgetting something.

37:13.500 --> 37:14.600
Forgetting? Oh, right.

37:14.800 --> 37:17.100
<i>Wilbur is the son
of Franny and Cornelius.</i>

37:17.200 --> 37:18.800
And nobody realised
you were from the past?

37:18.900 --> 37:19.900
Nope.

37:20.400 --> 37:21.500
Thank you. Thank you.

37:21.600 --> 37:24.900
Hold your applause.
Thank you very much.

37:36.900 --> 37:39.500
Doris, get it off! Get it off!

37:46.000 --> 37:47.700
I've got you now.

37:48.000 --> 37:49.100
Lewis!

37:51.400 --> 37:54.600
No, Lewis is my stupid roommate.

37:54.800 --> 37:58.000
My name's Mike Yagoobian.
People call me Goob,

37:58.000 --> 38:01.400
but today, everyone that beat me up
called me "puke face"

38:01.500 --> 38:04.100
and "butterfingers"
and "booger breath."

38:04.300 --> 38:07.000
Nice to see that they're branching out.

38:07.200 --> 38:09.600
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...

38:09.800 --> 38:11.700
Well, I was just looking for Lewis.

38:11.900 --> 38:14.700
Try the roof.
He's always up there being dumb.

38:14.800 --> 38:17.800
Of course. Why didn't I think of that?

38:18.400 --> 38:21.100
Mr Steak, you're my only friend.

38:23.100 --> 38:25.000
Game didn't go so well, huh?

38:25.100 --> 38:29.400
No, I fell asleep in the ninth inning,
and I missed the winning catch.

38:29.700 --> 38:31.200
Then I got beat up.

38:31.400 --> 38:35.400
Afterwards, Coach took me aside
and told me to let it go.

38:35.700 --> 38:37.500
I don't know. He's probably right.

38:37.600 --> 38:38.700
No!

38:38.800 --> 38:41.700
Everyone will tell you to let it go
and move on, but don't.

38:41.800 --> 38:45.700
Instead, let it fester
and boil inside of you.

38:45.800 --> 38:47.600
Take these feelings
and lock them away.

38:47.700 --> 38:49.200
Let them fuel your actions.

38:49.400 --> 38:51.300
Let hate be your ally,

38:51.500 --> 38:55.000
and you will be capable
of wonderfully horrid things.

38:56.500 --> 39:01.000
Heed my words, Goob. Don't let it go.

39:04.200 --> 39:05.300
What?

39:11.600 --> 39:13.200
Where is that boy?

39:15.200 --> 39:18.400
Good idea!
Separate and look for clues.

39:22.400 --> 39:25.400
Look, my dear! Look what I found!
It's a stick.

39:26.100 --> 39:27.600
Now, what did you find?

39:29.700 --> 39:31.300
Yes. Yes, I see.

39:31.500 --> 39:34.400
Time travel residue next to DNA
from Wilbur Robinson.

39:34.600 --> 39:37.800
That plus my stick must mean...

39:47.500 --> 39:50.400
To the future! Shotgun!

39:58.400 --> 39:59.400
I don't even know what I'm doing.

39:59.500 --> 40:00.500
Keep moving forward.

40:00.600 --> 40:02.500
I mean,
this stuff is way too advanced for me.

40:02.700 --> 40:03.700
Keep moving forward.

40:03.800 --> 40:05.800
And what if I can't fix this?
What are we gonna do?

40:06.000 --> 40:07.000
Keep moving forward.

40:07.400 --> 40:08.600
Why do you keep saying that?

40:08.700 --> 40:10.600
And don't just say,
"Keep moving forward."

40:10.700 --> 40:12.000
It's my dad's motto.

40:12.100 --> 40:14.000
Why would his motto be
"keep moving forward"?

40:14.000 --> 40:15.300
It's what he does.

40:15.400 --> 40:17.000
What's that supposed to mean?

40:17.100 --> 40:18.900
That is an excellent question.

40:19.100 --> 40:20.400
Robinson Industries,

40:20.500 --> 40:23.100
the world's leading
scientific-research-and-design factory.

40:23.200 --> 40:25.900
My dad runs the company.
They mass produce his inventions.

40:26.000 --> 40:30.000
His motto, "Keep moving forward."
It's what he does.

40:30.000 --> 40:31.800
- What has he invented?
- Everything.

40:31.900 --> 40:33.700
Carl, the time machine,
the travel tubes.

40:33.800 --> 40:36.400
Your dad invented the time machine?

40:36.600 --> 40:38.000
Yep. Five years ago,

40:38.100 --> 40:40.200
Dad wakes up in the middle
of the night in a cold sweat.

40:40.300 --> 40:43.100
He wants to build a time machine,
so he starts working.

40:43.200 --> 40:45.500
We're talking plans.
We're talking scale models.

40:45.700 --> 40:47.200
We're talking prototypes.

40:47.400 --> 40:48.700
That's a prototype?

40:48.800 --> 40:51.900
- The very first, or what's left of it.
- Yikes.

40:52.000 --> 40:54.100
Yeah. Dark day at the Robinson house.

40:54.300 --> 40:56.000
Prototypes two and three,
not much better.

40:56.200 --> 40:57.400
Number six, 58,

40:57.500 --> 40:58.800
212, 485,

40:59.000 --> 41:00.100
952,

41:00.100 --> 41:02.300
and they all end the same way.

41:04.500 --> 41:07.100
But he doesn't give up.

41:08.100 --> 41:10.700
Dude, I can't take you seriously
in that hat.

41:10.800 --> 41:13.900
He keeps working and working
until finally he gets it,

41:14.100 --> 41:15.600
the first working time machine.

41:15.700 --> 41:18.900
Then he keeps working and working
until finally he gets it again,

41:19.000 --> 41:20.000
the second working time machine.

41:20.200 --> 41:21.300
Kind of small.

41:21.400 --> 41:23.400
I'm assuming that's a joke.
I'm ignoring you for time reasons.

41:23.400 --> 41:24.800
This, my friend, is merely a model

41:24.900 --> 41:27.700
because, unfortunately,
time machine number two

41:27.900 --> 41:31.300
<i>is in the hands of the Bowler Hat Guy.</i>

41:38.400 --> 41:40.200
- Pretty amazing story, huh?
- Yeah.

41:40.300 --> 41:42.600
Now, are you ready to start working?

41:56.000 --> 41:58.500
I think that's it. I did it!

41:58.700 --> 42:00.000
I knew you could.

42:03.000 --> 42:05.400
Nice work, my friend.

42:16.700 --> 42:18.900
Well, you know what they say!
"Keep moving..."

42:19.000 --> 42:20.400
Don't say it!

42:26.800 --> 42:28.000
<i>Boys! Dinner time!</i>

42:28.100 --> 42:29.200
Not now, Mom!

42:29.400 --> 42:32.800
<i>If you aren't up here in five minutes,
I'm gonna come down and get you!</i>

42:34.800 --> 42:36.700
We'd better get up there.

42:41.000 --> 42:42.600
Let's get that boy!

42:43.600 --> 42:44.600
Sit here?

42:44.700 --> 42:46.300
But I want to look, too.

42:48.700 --> 42:50.000
A mini-Doris!

42:50.200 --> 42:53.200
I didn't even know you could do that.
It's so cute.

42:54.100 --> 42:56.100
Let's take her out for a spin.

42:57.500 --> 42:58.800
Sorry.

43:00.200 --> 43:01.400
Teamwork.

43:04.300 --> 43:05.400
<i>Sorry.</i>

43:06.900 --> 43:08.000
<i>Sorry!</i>

43:13.500 --> 43:14.700
There you are.

43:15.700 --> 43:18.300
Now, to lure him out of the house.

43:19.700 --> 43:23.600
I know! I'll blow it up! Yes!
Yes, and... No.

43:24.000 --> 43:26.700
No, that won't work. Then he'll be dead.

43:27.600 --> 43:28.600
<i>Oh! I know!</i>

43:28.800 --> 43:32.500
I'll turn him into a duck!
Yes! Yes, it's so evil!

43:33.700 --> 43:35.600
I don't know how to do that.

43:35.700 --> 43:38.400
I don't really need a duck.

43:40.400 --> 43:42.800
This may be harder than I thought.

43:46.300 --> 43:47.400
Hey, ring my doorbell.

43:47.500 --> 43:49.200
No, no, no, no, ring this doorbell.

43:49.300 --> 43:50.900
That doorbell will give you a rash.

43:52.000 --> 43:53.800
Yes! I'm two for two, man.

43:54.000 --> 43:55.500
If they don't do it on purpose,
it doesn't count.

43:55.600 --> 43:57.700
- Come on. Read your rule book.
- You know what?

43:57.800 --> 43:59.500
You can take your rule book
and shove it right...

44:00.500 --> 44:03.000
<i>I don't believe in fretting or grieving</i>

44:03.100 --> 44:05.100
<i>Why mess around with strife?</i>

44:05.800 --> 44:08.900
<i>Guess I was cut out
To step out and strut out</i>

44:09.000 --> 44:10.200
<i>Give me the simple life</i>

44:10.400 --> 44:14.100
Ladies and gentlemen,
dinner is served.

44:14.300 --> 44:16.700
Dinner is served.

44:16.800 --> 44:17.800
Dinner is served.

44:20.500 --> 44:22.200
Hooray! Italian food.

44:22.300 --> 44:23.600
I want a sloppy joe!

44:23.800 --> 44:25.900
Oh, Billie,
could you please pass the gravy?

44:26.100 --> 44:27.200
Coming to you, big girl.

44:27.300 --> 44:30.900
Reminds me of the time
my meatball pizza staved off civil war

44:31.000 --> 44:32.800
on the black moon of Keward.

44:33.600 --> 44:35.500
Where's my sloppy joe?

44:35.700 --> 44:37.000
Thank you for the gravy, Aunt Billie.

44:37.100 --> 44:39.300
- We gotta talk.
- How about some gravy? Over here.

44:39.400 --> 44:42.000
Why is the kid still here?
Any of this ring a bell?

44:42.200 --> 44:45.800
Science fair, Memory Scanner,
a time stream that needs fixing?

44:45.900 --> 44:46.900
Temporary setback.

44:47.100 --> 44:48.800
He's just having
a little confidence issue.

44:48.900 --> 44:49.900
- You want me to talk to him?
- No.

44:50.100 --> 44:51.400
- I give a mean back rub.
- No.

44:51.500 --> 44:52.500
- Shiatsu?
- No.

44:52.700 --> 44:53.800
- Feng shui.
- No.

44:53.900 --> 44:55.100
I've got it under control.

44:56.800 --> 44:58.600
So, Lewis, are you in Wilbur's class?

44:58.700 --> 44:59.700
- No.
- Yes.

44:59.800 --> 45:00.800
- Yes.
- No.

45:01.000 --> 45:02.300
Well, yes and no.

45:02.400 --> 45:05.100
Lewis is a new transfer student.

45:05.400 --> 45:06.400
Yeah.

45:06.500 --> 45:08.900
- Where are you from, Lewis?
- Canada?

45:09.100 --> 45:12.400
I think you mean North Montana.
Hasn't been called Canada in years.

45:12.500 --> 45:15.100
Do you know Sam Gundersen?

45:15.600 --> 45:17.600
- It's a big country.
- State.

45:17.700 --> 45:20.400
- I wonder if you're related.
- Maybe if he took his hat off.

45:20.500 --> 45:21.700
Oh, good idea.

45:21.900 --> 45:24.200
Then we can see
if he has the family cowlick.

45:24.400 --> 45:27.600
He can't,
because he's got bad hat-hair.

45:27.700 --> 45:29.100
Oh, nonsense.

45:29.300 --> 45:32.000
A North Montana man doesn't care
about hat-hair.

45:32.200 --> 45:33.400
Let's see the cowlick!

45:33.600 --> 45:34.900
All right, everyone, hold your horses.

45:35.100 --> 45:36.200
Lewis, do you mind?

45:36.300 --> 45:38.600
I'm afraid
this isn't gonna stop otherwise.

45:38.700 --> 45:40.000
- But... But...
- And so it begins.

45:40.200 --> 45:41.200
Now, don't be shy.

45:41.300 --> 45:43.700
- We're all family here.
- Ready, aim, fire!

45:48.100 --> 45:51.200
Surely, that is not the best you can do.

45:54.700 --> 45:56.000
Impressive, little sister.

45:56.100 --> 45:58.700
Your skills are strong,
but not strong enough.

45:58.800 --> 46:01.000
Your words
do not threaten me, brother.

46:01.100 --> 46:04.500
Then enough words.
Now the real battle begins.

46:14.600 --> 46:16.600
Your meatballs are useless against me.

46:16.700 --> 46:20.100
Then perhaps it's time
for spicy Italian sausage!

46:20.200 --> 46:21.300
No!

46:31.000 --> 46:32.800
That's right. I did it.

46:32.900 --> 46:34.400
Is dinner like this every night?

46:34.600 --> 46:36.300
No, yesterday, we had meatloaf.

46:41.300 --> 46:43.900
Okay, gang,
time for the second course.

46:44.000 --> 46:48.200
And what goes better with meatballs
than P.B. and J?

46:49.100 --> 46:51.200
Hey, that's just like...

46:55.000 --> 46:56.300
Stupid...

46:56.400 --> 46:57.500
Carl?

46:57.700 --> 46:58.700
Is everything all right?

46:58.800 --> 47:02.200
We're just experiencing bugs.

47:04.100 --> 47:05.500
Just what the doctor ordered.

47:06.200 --> 47:08.400
My friend Lewis is an inventor.
He can fix it.

47:08.500 --> 47:10.000
Wilbur, you know I can't.

47:10.100 --> 47:11.800
Come on. Give it a try.

47:11.900 --> 47:14.400
You don't understand
what's at stake here.

47:14.600 --> 47:17.100
Uncle Joe's seen the toast!

47:18.000 --> 47:20.000
We're past the point of no return!

47:20.200 --> 47:22.200
If he doesn't get P.B. and J...

47:22.400 --> 47:24.000
We all pay!

47:24.600 --> 47:25.600
I don't know.

47:25.700 --> 47:27.700
You would really be
helping us out, Lewis.

47:27.800 --> 47:28.900
Please.

47:33.000 --> 47:35.100
One dragonfly on the rocks, please,
Mr Barkeep.

47:35.200 --> 47:38.300
Hey, hey, Frankie, baby,
you gotta tell us one of your jokes.

47:38.400 --> 47:41.100
Yeah, Frankie.
How about that one with the bullfrog?

47:41.100 --> 47:42.800
All right, you bozos.

47:43.500 --> 47:45.600
<i>Have to get that boy out of the house.</i>

47:46.900 --> 47:48.400
<i>Sorry. Wait!</i>

47:48.600 --> 47:50.700
<i>So I turn to the bullfrog,
and you know what I says?</i>

47:50.900 --> 47:54.000
Talking frogs
with their own little outdoor bar,

47:54.100 --> 47:56.700
and so smartly dressed! Perfect!

47:56.800 --> 47:59.200
I says,
"Hey, not with my umbrella, you don't."

48:00.400 --> 48:02.600
- Frankie, you're a riot.
- I gotta go pee!

48:02.700 --> 48:04.200
- I love it.
- You bunch of goons.

48:13.500 --> 48:15.400
That's a good buzz. What the...

48:15.800 --> 48:19.000
Yes! You are now under my control.

48:19.100 --> 48:21.100
I am now under your control.

48:23.700 --> 48:25.500
- Stop laughing.
- Stop laughing.

48:25.700 --> 48:28.500
- Don't repeat everything I say.
- I won't repeat everything you say.

48:28.600 --> 48:30.400
- Excellent.
- Excellent.

48:30.700 --> 48:33.300
Did you just say, "Excellent,"
because I said, "Excellent"?

48:34.700 --> 48:35.700
No.

48:35.900 --> 48:38.000
- Excellent.
- Excellent.

48:39.100 --> 48:42.600
- So, Mr Fix-it, how's it looking?
- Pretty good, Mrs Robinson.

48:42.700 --> 48:44.600
I've recalibrated
the dispensing conduits

48:44.700 --> 48:46.800
and aligned
the ejection mechanism and...

48:47.500 --> 48:50.400
There he is,
that repulsive, half-witted fool!

48:50.600 --> 48:52.300
Now, my slave, seize the boy.

48:52.500 --> 48:54.000
<i>Bring him to me.</i>

48:56.000 --> 48:59.500
Did you not hear what I said, you idiot?
Grab the boy and bring him!

49:00.300 --> 49:03.600
Well, it's just that
there's a million people over there,

49:04.200 --> 49:05.800
and I have little arms.

49:06.500 --> 49:09.600
I'm just not so sure
how well this plan was thought through.

49:13.100 --> 49:14.200
Master?

49:16.100 --> 49:17.200
<i>Master?</i>

49:19.300 --> 49:20.600
Okay, that should do it.

49:21.000 --> 49:23.400
It's so exciting. Let her rip, Lewis!

49:23.500 --> 49:26.200
Quickly.
Uncle Joe can't hold on much longer.

49:26.500 --> 49:27.500
Everybody ready?

49:27.700 --> 49:29.300
- Go, Carl.
- Yeah!

49:32.700 --> 49:33.700
Is it gonna work?

49:33.900 --> 49:35.000
Oh, no!

49:39.200 --> 49:40.400
No!

49:40.600 --> 49:43.800
I didn't know. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

49:44.000 --> 49:46.300
- You failed!
- And it was awesome!

49:46.400 --> 49:48.600
- Exceptional!
- Outstanding!

49:49.600 --> 49:50.600
I've seen better.

49:50.600 --> 49:54.300
From failing, you learn.
From success, not so much.

49:54.400 --> 49:56.100
If I gave up every time I failed,

49:56.200 --> 49:58.100
I never would have made
the meatball cannon.

49:58.200 --> 50:00.500
I never would have made
my fireproof pants.

50:03.000 --> 50:04.100
Still working out the kinks.

50:04.300 --> 50:06.400
Like my husband always says...

50:13.700 --> 50:15.100
<i>Keep moving
Keep moving</i>

50:15.300 --> 50:16.300
<i>Stop</i>

50:20.900 --> 50:24.000
Okay, talking frog, not a good minion.

50:24.200 --> 50:26.400
Need another henchman,
something large, not too bright.

50:26.600 --> 50:28.200
Something that won't talk back.

50:28.300 --> 50:30.400
What is he still doing here?
Get rid of him.

50:31.000 --> 50:32.000
Oh, my noggin.

50:32.100 --> 50:34.300
Hey, what are you doing?
Get your lousy mitts off of me!

50:34.400 --> 50:36.300
You're gonna regret this!

50:37.200 --> 50:41.400
Wait! Wait! Don't move. That's it!

50:42.700 --> 50:44.900
I wonder if I should tell Doris.

50:45.300 --> 50:47.300
No, I'll make it a surprise.

50:53.700 --> 50:55.300
All right, everyone, quiet down.
Quiet down.

50:55.400 --> 50:59.100
I propose a toast to Lewis
and his brilliant failure.

50:59.200 --> 51:01.600
May it lead to success in the future.

51:02.100 --> 51:04.300
Gosh, you're all so nice.

51:04.800 --> 51:07.100
If I had a family, I...

51:08.000 --> 51:10.100
I'd want them to be just like you.

51:10.300 --> 51:12.700
Oh, well, then, to Lewis!

51:12.800 --> 51:14.300
To Lewis!

51:14.500 --> 51:15.500
To Lewis!

51:15.500 --> 51:16.600
Yeah!

51:17.000 --> 51:19.600
- Come on, Lewis!
- Good show, buddy!

51:20.600 --> 51:22.600
What if Louis Armstrong said,
"I can't"?

51:22.700 --> 51:23.900
You think he'd have walked
on the moon?

51:24.000 --> 51:26.200
Dear, Louis Armstrong was a singer.

51:29.400 --> 51:31.800
What did he mean, if he had a family?

51:31.900 --> 51:33.200
Oh, Lewis is an orphan.

51:33.300 --> 51:34.600
Orphan?

51:47.500 --> 51:49.200
- Oh, no!
- Big boy!

51:50.100 --> 51:51.700
Get up, you pansy!

51:51.900 --> 51:53.100
What a great plan!

51:53.200 --> 51:57.300
Go back in time and steal a dinosaur.
Oh, Doris will be so proud of me.

51:58.200 --> 52:00.600
Why didn't you tell me
you had a pet dinosaur?

52:00.700 --> 52:01.700
Because we don't.

52:01.800 --> 52:03.900
What are you talking about?
He's standing right here.

52:06.000 --> 52:08.600
Oh, no! No, you can't eat him!

52:08.700 --> 52:10.300
<i>I need him alive.</i>

52:12.200 --> 52:13.600
Choo-chew on this!

52:17.200 --> 52:18.500
Lewis!

52:24.200 --> 52:26.800
Ready, aim, fire!

52:35.400 --> 52:36.600
Got you!

52:38.800 --> 52:41.100
You messed with the wrong family!

52:48.400 --> 52:50.100
Ding-dong! Pizza's here!

52:55.000 --> 52:56.000
No!

52:58.000 --> 53:00.800
Okay, everybody,
this dino's deep-dished.

53:03.100 --> 53:04.600
Run!

53:06.700 --> 53:08.300
Oh! He ate Carl!

53:09.400 --> 53:12.700
- Help us! Help! Help!
- Oh, goodness!

53:24.400 --> 53:25.400
Oh, no.

53:31.300 --> 53:32.500
Incoming!

53:33.800 --> 53:34.800
Run!

53:36.000 --> 53:38.600
Now, go get that boy!

53:55.300 --> 53:56.900
<i>What's going on?</i>

53:57.100 --> 53:58.100
Why aren't you seizing the boy?

53:58.200 --> 53:59.300
I have a big head...

53:59.500 --> 54:01.100
...and little arms.

54:01.200 --> 54:02.600
I'm just not sure...

54:02.700 --> 54:04.500
...how well this plan was
thought through.

54:07.000 --> 54:08.300
Master?

54:09.300 --> 54:11.500
Stupid, stupid, stupid!

54:15.400 --> 54:16.500
Bowler Hat Guy!

54:16.700 --> 54:18.000
Him you can eat.

54:18.300 --> 54:20.400
- Lewis, run!
- Wilbur!

54:37.900 --> 54:38.900
No!

54:59.600 --> 55:00.900
Oh, no!

55:02.200 --> 55:05.100
Little Doris now sleeps with the fishes.

55:09.800 --> 55:12.100
- Nice catch.
- Nice meatball shooting!

55:12.200 --> 55:13.700
Guess we made
a pretty good team, huh?

55:13.800 --> 55:15.400
Yeah, guess we did.

55:16.300 --> 55:18.100
- Are you boys all right?
- We're good, Mom.

55:18.300 --> 55:19.900
Yeah, didn't you see us
take out that dinosaur?

55:20.100 --> 55:22.300
Oh, man! It was so cool, Mom!

55:23.400 --> 55:26.700
Oh, I mean, I'm sorry. I didn't...

55:27.000 --> 55:28.500
Oh, Lewis, it's okay.

55:31.500 --> 55:33.200
I'm really happy you're safe.

55:33.500 --> 55:35.100
- Your head.
- What?

55:36.100 --> 55:37.600
It's just a bruise, Lewis.

55:38.700 --> 55:42.200
You all sacrificed so much for me.

55:42.200 --> 55:45.100
- Well, of course.
- You are a special kid.

55:45.200 --> 55:46.300
One of a kind.

55:46.500 --> 55:49.600
Okay, you should get him out of here
before something really bad happens.

55:49.700 --> 55:52.700
Silly, silly robot.
I've got it all under control.

55:53.100 --> 55:55.300
Okay, everybody,
it's been a long, hard day

55:55.400 --> 55:57.200
filled with emotional turmoil
and dinosaur fights,

55:57.400 --> 56:00.100
so why don't you all hit the hay,
and Lewis and me will get going?

56:02.200 --> 56:05.500
Do you have to go now?
I mean, you know, it's getting late.

56:05.500 --> 56:08.800
Maybe Lewis could spend the night.

56:09.000 --> 56:10.800
Mom, maybe some other time, okay?

56:10.900 --> 56:14.700
Well, any time you want to come over,
you just come over.

56:14.800 --> 56:17.700
- Mom.
- The truth is, we love having you.

56:17.900 --> 56:20.200
- We really have to go.
- No.

56:21.000 --> 56:24.000
No, you don't. You have to stay.

56:24.800 --> 56:28.200
I mean, who would be a better family
for you than us?

56:29.000 --> 56:30.400
What do you say, Lewis?

56:31.400 --> 56:32.900
Do you want to be a Robinson?

56:35.400 --> 56:38.300
You want to adopt me?

56:47.800 --> 56:49.400
- Yeah!
- Yes!

56:58.100 --> 57:00.400
Okay, it's true. I'm from the past.

57:00.500 --> 57:01.600
Now you know the big secret.

57:01.800 --> 57:05.700
Wilbur, what have you done?
How could you bring him here?

57:05.800 --> 57:07.600
That is an excellent question.

57:07.800 --> 57:09.200
Please, don't get mad at Wilbur.

57:09.300 --> 57:10.600
He was just being a good friend.

57:10.800 --> 57:14.700
Lewis, I am so sorry,
but you have to go.

57:14.800 --> 57:16.200
What? You just said...

57:16.300 --> 57:18.100
I know what I said.

57:18.200 --> 57:20.100
I'm from the past. So what?

57:21.200 --> 57:23.600
Lewis. Lewis, look at me. You're...

57:24.300 --> 57:25.800
You're a great kid,

57:25.900 --> 57:28.700
and we would never do anything
to hurt you,

57:30.000 --> 57:33.500
but I'm sorry.
You have to go back to your own time.

57:34.500 --> 57:39.500
Yeah, about that,
one of the time machines is broken,

57:39.700 --> 57:43.000
and the other one was stolen
by a guy with a bowler hat,

57:43.100 --> 57:45.900
which kind of explains the dino.

57:51.200 --> 57:52.400
I'm calling your father.

57:52.500 --> 57:54.000
Wait. If I have to leave,

57:54.100 --> 57:56.200
can I at least go back
and find my mom?

57:56.400 --> 57:58.000
Wilbur promised.

57:58.100 --> 57:59.200
You promised what?

57:59.400 --> 58:01.100
I was never gonna do it. I swear!

58:01.800 --> 58:04.000
- You lied to me?
- No!

58:05.300 --> 58:06.300
Yes.

58:06.700 --> 58:07.900
Lewis! Lewis, wait!

58:08.100 --> 58:11.400
I can't believe I was dumb enough
to actually believe you were my friend!

58:12.000 --> 58:13.300
I am your friend!

58:13.500 --> 58:16.800
Mister, you're grounded till you die.

58:37.300 --> 58:40.500
<i>Oh, yes, Doris, it is a shame.</i>

58:40.600 --> 58:45.500
<i>All he wants to do is go back in time
to meet the mother he never knew,</i>

58:46.400 --> 58:50.700
<i>but they won't let him.
We'd let him, though.</i>

58:51.700 --> 58:54.500
<i>Too bad
we don't have a time machine.</i>

58:54.700 --> 58:58.000
<i>Oh, wait. We do.</i>

58:58.400 --> 58:59.900
Bowler Hat Guy?

59:00.300 --> 59:02.900
- Hello, Lewis.
- What do you want?

59:03.100 --> 59:05.600
To make your dream come true.

59:05.800 --> 59:08.700
All you have to do is put
Humpty Dumpty back together again,

59:08.900 --> 59:11.300
and we'll take you back
to find your mommy.

59:12.100 --> 59:13.100
Lewis!

59:14.100 --> 59:16.400
Let's just talk about this, Lewis.
Come on!

59:16.500 --> 59:18.100
I know you're around here somewhere.

59:20.800 --> 59:21.800
Lewis!

59:42.200 --> 59:45.500
I can't imagine why you're so interested
in this piece of junk.

59:45.500 --> 59:47.800
That's for me to know
and you to find out.

59:47.900 --> 59:49.900
Now, show me how to work this thing.

59:50.000 --> 59:51.700
It doesn't work. Never did.

59:51.800 --> 59:52.800
Well, supposing it did,

59:52.900 --> 59:54.700
and if one were presenting
the invention to, say,

59:54.800 --> 59:57.700
a board of directors
for a very large invention company,

59:57.800 --> 59:59.400
where might one find the "On" switch?

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:01.500
Hypothetically speaking, of course.

01:00:01.600 --> 01:00:03.700
All right, first, you turn this knob twice,

01:00:03.800 --> 01:00:05.400
then push this red button,

01:00:05.500 --> 01:00:06.800
and that's it. It's pretty easy.

01:00:06.900 --> 01:00:08.200
What a stupid way to turn it on!

01:00:08.400 --> 01:00:10.400
Okay, take me to see my mom now.

01:00:10.500 --> 01:00:11.800
Yes, of course.

01:00:11.900 --> 01:00:13.100
Doris?

01:00:15.900 --> 01:00:16.900
We had a deal!

01:00:16.900 --> 01:00:18.700
Crossies! Doesn't count.

01:00:18.900 --> 01:00:21.300
Why are you doing this to me?
I never did anything to you.

01:00:21.400 --> 01:00:23.300
You still haven't figured it out?

01:00:23.400 --> 01:00:24.700
Figured out what?

01:00:24.800 --> 01:00:26.700
Well, let's see if this rings a bell.

01:00:26.900 --> 01:00:29.100
Father of the Future,
inventor extraordinaire,

01:00:29.300 --> 01:00:30.700
"Keep moving forward"?

01:00:30.800 --> 01:00:33.200
That's not me. That's Wilbur's dad.

01:00:37.300 --> 01:00:39.200
Are you saying

01:00:39.400 --> 01:00:41.700
that I'm Wilbur's dad?

01:00:42.600 --> 01:00:44.300
Give the boy a prize.

01:00:44.900 --> 01:00:48.200
You grew up to be the founder
of this wretched time,

01:00:48.400 --> 01:00:49.900
so I plan to destroy your destiny.

01:00:50.100 --> 01:00:53.000
- Easy peasy, rice and cheesy.
- Well...

01:00:53.500 --> 01:00:55.200
So if I'm Wilbur's dad...

01:00:55.300 --> 01:00:56.300
Keep going.

01:00:56.800 --> 01:00:58.500
If I'm Wilbur's dad...

01:00:58.600 --> 01:01:00.200
Yes, thank you, we've established that.

01:01:00.300 --> 01:01:02.900
But what does that have to do
with you?

01:01:03.800 --> 01:01:06.600
Allow me to shed some light
on the subject.

01:01:09.500 --> 01:01:10.800
My old room!

01:01:10.900 --> 01:01:13.200
I think you mean our old room.

01:01:13.300 --> 01:01:16.200
- What?
- Yes! Yes, it is I,

01:01:16.300 --> 01:01:17.600
Mike Yagoobian!

01:01:18.400 --> 01:01:21.800
I know.
I'm disgusting, but one learns to love it.

01:01:21.900 --> 01:01:23.200
How did you end up like this?

01:01:23.300 --> 01:01:27.900
Well, it's a long and pitiful story
about a young boy with a dream,

01:01:28.100 --> 01:01:30.600
a dream of winning
a Little League championship,

01:01:33.800 --> 01:01:37.200
<i>a dream that was ruined
in the last inning.</i>

01:01:37.600 --> 01:01:40.300
<i>We lost by one run because of me.</i>

01:01:40.500 --> 01:01:41.500
Get him!

01:01:41.600 --> 01:01:45.500
If I hadn't fallen asleep,
I would have caught the ball!

01:01:45.700 --> 01:01:47.600
And we would have won!

01:01:47.700 --> 01:01:49.200
Do you understand?

01:01:49.300 --> 01:01:51.800
<i>For some reason,
no one wanted to adopt me.</i>

01:01:51.900 --> 01:01:54.900
<i>Whiz kid Cornelius Robinson
graduates from college at age 14.</i>

01:01:55.100 --> 01:01:58.600
<i>This year's Nobel Prize goes
to a young Cornelius Robinson.</i>

01:01:58.700 --> 01:02:00.200
Hey, Goob, what's up? Cool binder.

01:02:00.400 --> 01:02:02.200
Hey, Goob,
wanna come over to my house today?

01:02:02.400 --> 01:02:04.200
<i>They all hated me.</i>

01:02:04.500 --> 01:02:07.700
<i>Eventually, they closed down
the orphanage and everyone left,</i>

01:02:07.900 --> 01:02:09.400
<i>except me.</i>

01:02:09.500 --> 01:02:11.400
<i>Cornelius Robinson rebuilds Inventco.</i>

01:02:11.500 --> 01:02:12.600
<i>- Robinson reaches out to...
- It's new name,</i>

01:02:12.800 --> 01:02:14.700
<i>- Robinson Industries.
- Cornelius Robinson!</i>

01:02:14.800 --> 01:02:17.800
<i>- Cornelius Robinson is now...
- Now here's another amazing...</i>

01:02:17.900 --> 01:02:22.800
<i>It was then
that I realised it wasn't my fault.</i>

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:24.300
<i>It was yours.</i>

01:02:24.400 --> 01:02:27.500
<i>If you hadn't kept me up all night
working on your stupid project,</i>

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:29.600
<i>then I wouldn't have missed the catch,</i>

01:02:29.700 --> 01:02:33.600
<i>so I devised a brilliant plan
to get my revenge.</i>

01:02:36.400 --> 01:02:38.900
Robinson, you stink!

01:02:39.400 --> 01:02:43.400
<i>Then, just as I was on the brink
of destroying Robinson Industries,</i>

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.200
<i>I met her.</i>

01:02:49.300 --> 01:02:51.300
<i>We retreated to our villainous lair,</i>

01:02:51.400 --> 01:02:54.400
<i>where Doris spun a tale
of deception and woe.</i>

01:02:54.600 --> 01:02:57.800
<i>Apparently, you invented her
to be a Helping Hat,</i>

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.100
<i>a slave to humankind,</i>

01:03:03.900 --> 01:03:06.900
<i>but Doris knew she was capable
of so much more.</i>

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.700
<i>However, you didn't see
her true potential.</i>

01:03:14.800 --> 01:03:16.700
<i>- Got it.
- So you shut her down,</i>

01:03:23.100 --> 01:03:25.000
<i>or so you thought.</i>

01:03:34.200 --> 01:03:36.300
<i>We both had a score
to settle with you,</i>

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:41.800
<i>and while my plan for revenge
was brilliant, Doris' was...</i>

01:03:41.900 --> 01:03:43.700
<i>Well, we went with Doris',</i>

01:03:43.900 --> 01:03:48.200
<i>but I made
a very, very important contribution.</i>

01:03:48.300 --> 01:03:50.700
<i>Together we made the perfect team.</i>

01:04:00.500 --> 01:04:01.500
Wilbur!

01:04:01.600 --> 01:04:04.100
Make sure you shut that door tight,
or else the alarm won't engage.

01:04:04.300 --> 01:04:05.300
Yeah, Mom.

01:04:08.800 --> 01:04:11.200
<i>I went to your house,
snuck in the garage</i>

01:04:11.300 --> 01:04:13.000
<i>and stole the time machine,</i>

01:04:15.900 --> 01:04:20.600
<i>all thanks to that pointy-haired little kid
who forgot to lock the garage door.</i>

01:04:24.800 --> 01:04:27.700
And now all that's left
is to return to Inventco,

01:04:27.800 --> 01:04:30.400
where I'll pass off
your little gizmo as my own.

01:04:30.600 --> 01:04:32.800
But you have no idea
what that could do to this future!

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:36.000
I don't care. I just want to ruin your life.

01:04:36.100 --> 01:04:37.600
Goob, I had no idea.

01:04:37.800 --> 01:04:39.600
Shut up! And don't call me Goob!

01:04:39.700 --> 01:04:42.300
How many evil villains do you know
who can pull off a name like Goob?

01:04:42.800 --> 01:04:44.600
Look, I'm sorry
your life turned out so bad,

01:04:44.800 --> 01:04:46.800
but don't blame me.
You messed it up yourself.

01:04:46.900 --> 01:04:50.400
You just focused on the bad stuff
when all you had to do was

01:04:50.600 --> 01:04:54.200
let go of the past
and keep moving forward.

01:04:54.400 --> 01:04:55.400
Let's see.

01:04:55.500 --> 01:04:58.300
Take responsibility for my own life
or blame you.

01:04:59.600 --> 01:05:02.000
"Blame you" wins hands down!

01:05:05.400 --> 01:05:08.500
This is gonna be
the best day of my life!

01:05:16.200 --> 01:05:19.400
Doris, would you be a dear
and open the hatch for me, please?

01:05:26.200 --> 01:05:27.400
No!

01:05:28.800 --> 01:05:32.800
Well, I hate to foil your evil plan
and run, but ta-ta!

01:05:35.100 --> 01:05:36.500
But...

01:05:36.600 --> 01:05:38.500
I bet you're glad to see me.

01:05:39.600 --> 01:05:41.600
That's for not locking the garage door.

01:05:43.100 --> 01:05:44.200
You know about that?

01:05:44.300 --> 01:05:45.600
I know everything.

01:05:45.800 --> 01:05:46.800
You gotta admit,

01:05:46.800 --> 01:05:48.900
this will be a great story
to tell me someday.

01:05:51.700 --> 01:05:54.000
Look at that, boys.
We're almost home free.

01:06:02.800 --> 01:06:04.200
Oh, no!

01:06:05.800 --> 01:06:07.500
Take a good look around, boys,

01:06:07.700 --> 01:06:10.300
because your future
is about to change.

01:06:11.800 --> 01:06:14.300
Lewis, you have to fix
the time machine.

01:06:14.400 --> 01:06:16.400
No. No, I can't.

01:06:22.600 --> 01:06:24.700
What about your dad?
You could call him.

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.200
- You are my dad.
- But that's in the future.

01:06:27.400 --> 01:06:30.000
There won't be a future
unless you fix the time machine.

01:06:33.700 --> 01:06:34.900
<i>Look, I messed up.</i>

01:06:35.200 --> 01:06:38.000
I left the garage unlocked,
and I've tried like crazy to fix things,

01:06:38.100 --> 01:06:39.100
but now it's up to you.

01:06:41.200 --> 01:06:42.500
You can do it, Dad.

01:06:43.800 --> 01:06:48.700
- Lewis? Lewis!
- Wilbur? Wilbur!

01:06:52.700 --> 01:06:53.700
Wilbur.

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.900
Mrs Robinson? Uncle Art? Lefty?

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.000
<i>Prepare to be amazed.</i>

01:07:13.200 --> 01:07:15.800
<i>I call it the Memory Scanner.</i>

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:19.300
<i>So, Yagoobian, any other ideas
you'd like to share with us?</i>

01:07:19.400 --> 01:07:22.600
<i>Yes. I call them Helping Hats.</i>

01:07:25.700 --> 01:07:27.100
<i>They're everywhere!</i>

01:07:29.400 --> 01:07:31.800
<i>Doris, what's happening?
I don't understand.</i>

01:07:31.900 --> 01:07:34.600
<i>I just wanted to ruin his future, not this.</i>

01:07:35.800 --> 01:07:37.700
<i>No!</i>

01:07:43.200 --> 01:07:46.600
No. No, this can't be happening! No!

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.900
Oh, Lewis, it's already happened.

01:09:44.600 --> 01:09:47.600
Why did I ever invent that stupid hat?

01:09:57.800 --> 01:10:02.600
Take a good look around, Doris,
'cause your future's about to change.

01:10:10.800 --> 01:10:12.200
Goob, stop!

01:10:12.900 --> 01:10:13.900
You don't know what you're doing!

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:16.000
Yes, I do. I'm ruining your future.

01:10:16.200 --> 01:10:17.200
She's using you, Goob,

01:10:17.400 --> 01:10:19.400
and when she gets what she wants,
she'll get rid of you.

01:10:19.600 --> 01:10:21.300
What? What?

01:10:26.400 --> 01:10:28.700
I am never going to invent you.

01:10:34.800 --> 01:10:37.100
Come on, Goob.
I've got to show you something.

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:47.100
Doris?

01:10:47.600 --> 01:10:49.200
I thought she was my friend.

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:21.900
You did it, Lewis. You did it!

01:11:24.600 --> 01:11:26.100
I'll hold him while you run for help.

01:11:26.200 --> 01:11:27.200
Let him go.

01:11:27.600 --> 01:11:29.900
What are you doing? He's the bad guy.

01:11:30.100 --> 01:11:32.600
No, he's not. He's my roommate.

01:11:32.800 --> 01:11:34.500
- What?
- He's my old roommate,

01:11:34.600 --> 01:11:36.100
and I really think
you guys should adopt him.

01:11:36.200 --> 01:11:38.300
- Are you nuts?
- Give me one good reason why not.

01:11:38.400 --> 01:11:39.800
I'll give you three good reasons.

01:11:39.900 --> 01:11:42.200
He stole our time machine,
tried to ruin your future,

01:11:42.400 --> 01:11:44.600
and he smells
like he hasn't showered in 30 years!

01:11:44.800 --> 01:11:47.900
May I remind you, I'm your father,
and you have to do what I say.

01:11:50.100 --> 01:11:53.200
Okay, Mr Yagoobian,
do you want to be a...

01:11:53.300 --> 01:11:55.300
- Where'd he go?
- Goob?

01:11:56.400 --> 01:11:57.500
Goob!

01:11:59.400 --> 01:12:00.600
Goob.

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:28.000
Are you hurt? Any broken bones?

01:12:28.100 --> 01:12:29.600
- No, I'm...
- Do you have a temperature?

01:12:29.800 --> 01:12:31.100
- Brain fog?
- Scurvy?

01:12:31.300 --> 01:12:32.300
- Tapeworm?
- Cellulite?

01:12:32.400 --> 01:12:34.900
No. No, no, I'm fine. I feel fine.

01:12:35.100 --> 01:12:38.700
In fact,
better than I've felt in a long time.

01:12:38.800 --> 01:12:41.900
Franny, they're gone.
Oh, this is terrible!

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:43.700
- Oh, boy.
- Well, he's home early.

01:12:43.800 --> 01:12:47.200
Franny, where are you?
The time machines are gone!

01:13:00.300 --> 01:13:01.900
Ratted out by the old lady.

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:04.100
Harsh.

01:13:08.800 --> 01:13:09.900
Okay.

01:13:19.900 --> 01:13:22.900
Yeah, beats working
in an office every day.

01:13:23.100 --> 01:13:24.800
Yeah, no kidding.

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:27.300
Hey!
Want to see the one I'm most proud of?

01:13:27.400 --> 01:13:28.700
Yeah.

01:13:31.400 --> 01:13:33.500
Oh, no, no, no. That one.

01:13:46.800 --> 01:13:48.900
It was our first real invention.

01:13:49.600 --> 01:13:51.300
It's the one that started it all.

01:13:51.400 --> 01:13:52.500
Wowie.

01:13:53.400 --> 01:13:57.000
So if I go back now,
then this will be my future.

01:13:57.100 --> 01:13:59.600
Well, that depends on you.

01:13:59.800 --> 01:14:00.800
Nothing is set in stone.

01:14:00.800 --> 01:14:04.500
You gotta make the right choices
and keep moving forward.

01:14:08.300 --> 01:14:11.500
Since it's gonna work this time,
that means I...

01:14:11.600 --> 01:14:15.700
We won't finally get to see
what Mom looks like?

01:14:18.200 --> 01:14:19.400
Do we ever meet her?

01:14:22.500 --> 01:14:24.400
I think
you're just gonna have to get back

01:14:24.400 --> 01:14:27.000
to that science fair
and find out for yourself.

01:14:27.200 --> 01:14:29.300
I had a feeling
you were gonna say that.

01:14:30.300 --> 01:14:33.300
That's because we are one smart kid.

01:14:38.100 --> 01:14:39.100
- So long!
- Bye-bye, Lewis!

01:14:39.200 --> 01:14:41.500
- Farewell, future brother-in-law.
- So long! See you later, Lewis!

01:14:41.700 --> 01:14:43.400
Oh, don't forget the mashed potatoes!

01:14:44.700 --> 01:14:46.700
- Have a safe trip, little Lewis.
- I will.

01:14:46.800 --> 01:14:48.500
Hey, while I got you here,

01:14:48.600 --> 01:14:51.900
just a couple of little suggestions
regarding my design.

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:56.300
Let's face it, these skinny limbs
don't exactly make the teapot whistle.

01:14:56.500 --> 01:14:59.300
All that really matters is,
hey, don't forget to invent me.

01:14:59.500 --> 01:15:01.800
- Are you kidding? No way!
- I love you.

01:15:02.900 --> 01:15:05.300
There's so many things
I wish I could ask you.

01:15:05.400 --> 01:15:07.900
Excuse me.
Time travel now, questions later.

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:09.000
- But I...
- Don't worry.

01:15:09.100 --> 01:15:11.800
Just get back to that science fair,
and we'll see you real soon.

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:15.200
Oh, right. Right, okay, I will. Bye.

01:15:15.300 --> 01:15:17.700
- Goodbye, son.
- Thanks again for everything!

01:15:17.900 --> 01:15:20.300
- Wait. Lewis, one more thing.
- Yeah?

01:15:20.400 --> 01:15:25.100
Just a little tip for the future.
I am always right.

01:15:25.300 --> 01:15:28.100
Even when I'm wrong, I'm right.

01:15:30.100 --> 01:15:33.200
She's right.
I'd just go with it if I were you.

01:15:34.100 --> 01:15:35.300
And I am.

01:15:36.100 --> 01:15:37.700
Then you're absolutely right.

01:15:40.100 --> 01:15:41.900
All right, I'm coming.

01:15:42.400 --> 01:15:44.200
Well, it's not like
you're never gonna see them again.

01:15:44.300 --> 01:15:46.000
They are your family, after all.

01:16:14.700 --> 01:16:15.700
Wait a minute.

01:16:15.800 --> 01:16:17.700
You're supposed to take me back
to the science fair.

01:16:17.900 --> 01:16:19.000
I know.

01:16:24.400 --> 01:16:27.000
Well, I think
you punched in the wrong numbers.

01:16:27.100 --> 01:16:29.600
We agreed that,
if you fixed the time machine,

01:16:29.800 --> 01:16:31.500
I'd take you back to see your mom.

01:16:31.700 --> 01:16:32.800
What?

01:16:50.700 --> 01:16:52.100
A deal's a deal.

01:18:50.300 --> 01:18:53.000
I don't get it. Why'd you just let her go?

01:18:53.800 --> 01:18:56.800
Because I already have a family.

01:19:05.700 --> 01:19:09.200
I never thought my dad
would be my best friend.

01:19:10.100 --> 01:19:12.200
Now, now, don't make me come
and bail you out again.

01:19:13.900 --> 01:19:14.900
I won't.

01:19:15.100 --> 01:19:16.900
Remember, I've got a time machine.

01:19:17.100 --> 01:19:18.500
If you mess up again,
I'll just keep coming back

01:19:18.600 --> 01:19:19.700
till you get it right.

01:19:21.900 --> 01:19:23.400
- You got that motto?
- I got it.

01:19:23.600 --> 01:19:24.800
Don't forget it.

01:19:24.900 --> 01:19:26.600
I don't think that's possible.

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:29.200
You better get going.

01:19:29.900 --> 01:19:31.400
See you later, Wilbur.

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:50.400
Wait a minute!

01:19:58.700 --> 01:20:00.600
Goob! Goob, wake up!

01:20:00.700 --> 01:20:01.700
What?

01:20:04.500 --> 01:20:05.800
That's it!

01:20:13.700 --> 01:20:16.400
Mr Willerstein,
I know what went wrong.

01:20:16.500 --> 01:20:18.600
Can I have one more chance? Please!

01:20:20.700 --> 01:20:23.300
My ride isn't here yet, so fire it up.

01:20:24.900 --> 01:20:26.500
I need a volunteer.

01:20:29.700 --> 01:20:31.200
Now, just give me a date to input.

01:20:31.400 --> 01:20:32.700
Well, now, let's see.

01:20:32.800 --> 01:20:35.700
There's my first science fair,
the day I got my first microscope,

01:20:35.900 --> 01:20:38.900
the time I swam the English Channel,
my first gold medal for the luge.

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:41.100
I know.

01:20:42.200 --> 01:20:43.400
Perfect!

01:20:55.300 --> 01:20:58.200
<i>- You look gorgeous.
- He's a lucky guy.</i>

01:21:00.200 --> 01:21:01.900
Oh! It works.

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:04.400
- It works!
- It works.

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:07.100
<i>You look beautiful, Lucille.</i>

01:21:12.200 --> 01:21:13.300
Bud?

01:21:14.500 --> 01:21:16.300
- Would you look at that?
- Whoa!

01:21:16.600 --> 01:21:18.300
Honey! Honey, you're just in time.

01:21:18.400 --> 01:21:21.200
- Lucille!
- You did it, Lewis! You did it!

01:21:21.300 --> 01:21:22.600
This invention is brilliant!

01:21:22.700 --> 01:21:24.100
Kid, you're this fair's MVP!

01:21:24.300 --> 01:21:26.300
That was some show you put on.

01:21:26.400 --> 01:21:29.700
You're a real special kid,

01:21:32.400 --> 01:21:35.500
but you don't look like a Lewis.
You look more like a...

01:21:35.600 --> 01:21:38.200
Cornelius. I get that a lot.

01:21:39.300 --> 01:21:41.600
Oh, no! Sorry, mister.

01:21:41.800 --> 01:21:43.100
No harm done.

01:21:43.900 --> 01:21:46.200
Frankie, what have I told you
about running away?

01:21:46.300 --> 01:21:48.500
- Frankie?
- My star pupil.

01:21:48.700 --> 01:21:53.300
My name's Franny,
and I teach frogs music.

01:21:53.500 --> 01:21:54.500
Really?

01:21:55.400 --> 01:21:58.200
You know that frogs
have more musical ability than people?

01:21:58.300 --> 01:22:00.600
But nobody believes me.

01:22:01.500 --> 01:22:03.400
They all think I'm crazy.

01:22:04.700 --> 01:22:07.400
You think I'm crazy, too.

01:22:07.500 --> 01:22:10.400
No. No, I think you're right.

01:22:13.800 --> 01:22:15.500
Over here? There he is.

01:22:15.600 --> 01:22:18.700
Kid, we'd like to get a story
on you for the local paper.

01:22:18.800 --> 01:22:21.300
You've got a bright future ahead of you.

01:22:24.300 --> 01:22:25.500
<i>Let it go</i>

01:22:25.700 --> 01:22:26.700
Yeah.

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:29.900
<i>Let it roll right off your shoulder</i>

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:31.400
<i>Don't you know</i>

01:22:33.100 --> 01:22:35.400
<i>The hardest part is over</i>

01:22:35.600 --> 01:22:37.100
<i>Let it in</i>

01:22:38.200 --> 01:22:40.800
<i>Let your clarity define you</i>

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:42.500
<i>In the end</i>

01:22:43.700 --> 01:22:47.700
<i>We will only just remember
How it feels</i>

01:22:57.100 --> 01:22:59.000
<i>Let it slide</i>

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:02.700
<i>Let your troubles fall behind you</i>

01:23:02.900 --> 01:23:04.600
<i>Let it shine</i>

01:23:05.600 --> 01:23:08.100
<i>Until you feel it all around you</i>

01:23:08.300 --> 01:23:10.800
<i>And I don't mind</i>

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:13.700
<i>If it's me you need to turn to</i>

01:23:13.800 --> 01:23:15.900
<i>We'll get by</i>

01:23:16.600 --> 01:23:20.700
<i>It's the heart that really matters
In the end</i>

01:23:21.300 --> 01:23:23.700
<i>Our lives are made</i>

01:23:23.900 --> 01:23:26.500
<i>In these small hours</i>

01:23:26.800 --> 01:23:29.100
<i>These little wonders</i>

01:23:29.200 --> 01:23:32.000
<i>These twists and turns of fate</i>

01:23:32.300 --> 01:23:34.500
<i>Time falls away</i>

01:23:34.600 --> 01:23:37.700
<i>But these small hours</i>
