WEBVTT

00:01.376 --> 00:03.086
<i>Riley Morten coming up now,</i>

00:03.170 --> 00:06.006
<i>Kelley at second.
Started the inning with a double.</i>

00:06.006 --> 00:07.799
<i>That seems like an hour ago.</i>

00:07.925 --> 00:09.301
Honey, I thought you were gonna
take out the garbage.

00:09.301 --> 00:10.427
I am.

00:10.511 --> 00:14.556
<i>High fly to right. Hooking, hooking, foul.</i>

00:15.307 --> 00:17.643
- Phil.
- Yes. I'm getting it.

00:17.643 --> 00:21.271
<i>Good guys trail, three to two,
last of the ninth, one out...</i>

00:21.730 --> 00:24.274
I was... I was gonna get it.

00:26.818 --> 00:28.237
- Dylan?
- Hey, Mrs. Dunphy.

00:28.237 --> 00:31.073
I'm just waiting for Haley.

00:31.073 --> 00:33.200
- Did you ring the bell?
- I texted.

00:33.200 --> 00:35.035
She said she'd be down in just a minute.

00:35.160 --> 00:38.038
- Great. Tell her I said hi.
- I will.

00:38.330 --> 00:42.751
Dylan! D Money!
Chilling with Dylan the Villain!

00:42.835 --> 00:45.254
- "D" to the "Y" to the...
- Hey, Mr. Dunphy.

00:45.379 --> 00:47.965
Hey! Come on in, you're just in time
to catch the end of the game.

00:47.965 --> 00:50.717
I'm not really a baseball guy.

00:50.801 --> 00:52.678
- Haley says hi.
- I was just being facetious.

00:52.678 --> 00:56.557
Come on.
I'll catch you up. Sit it, park it.

00:57.891 --> 00:59.476
Come on, I don't bite.

01:01.144 --> 01:06.316
Kidding. I'm kidding.
Okay, see that guy? He's the tying run.

01:06.400 --> 01:09.903
Interesting story about him,
he's been stuck on second base forever,

01:09.987 --> 01:12.030
and I'm pretty sure he's going
to try and steal third,

01:12.114 --> 01:15.242
which is just a terrible, terrible idea.

01:15.242 --> 01:16.827
How are you and Haley doing?

01:23.542 --> 01:26.086
I wish I could stay home with you
and fly toy airplanes.

01:26.170 --> 01:27.671
These aren't toy airplanes, Manny.

01:27.671 --> 01:29.756
These are models
and they're very complicated.

01:29.840 --> 01:32.217
You want to fly one of these,
you got to be familiar

01:32.301 --> 01:35.012
with airfoil, drag, lift, and thrust.

01:35.012 --> 01:37.347
And these are all principles
of aerodynamics.

01:37.431 --> 01:38.932
The box says 12 and up.

01:40.100 --> 01:41.143
What?

01:42.144 --> 01:45.898
You can fly toy planes with Jay next time.
Today, you have to spend time with Luke.

01:45.898 --> 01:47.691
- Why?
- Because his mother invited you,

01:47.691 --> 01:48.859
so you go.

01:48.859 --> 01:51.069
Family needs to be close. Right, Jay?

01:51.153 --> 01:54.948
I'm pretty sure this is a typo.
<i>Men need their hobbies.</i>

01:55.032 --> 01:56.408
<i>Manny's father had many hobbies.</i>

01:56.950 --> 01:58.702
Like hiking in the desert.

01:58.702 --> 02:01.413
That kind of skiing
that they drop you from the...

02:01.413 --> 02:03.081
How do you say in English...

02:03.165 --> 02:04.333
Helicopter.

02:04.333 --> 02:08.212
Yes. Once, on a dare,
he even boxed with an alligator.

02:08.212 --> 02:12.382
Wrestle. You wrestle.
You can't box with alligators.

02:12.633 --> 02:13.717
Are you sure?

02:13.717 --> 02:16.345
How would they get gloves
on those little claws?

02:16.678 --> 02:20.265
- Aren't they like tiny little hands...
- No!

02:20.349 --> 02:21.850
Okay, now I forgot
what we're talking about.

02:21.934 --> 02:25.020
Anyway, hobbies are
important for the men,

02:25.145 --> 02:31.318
whether you're risking your life or flying
little planes from a safe distance.

02:34.029 --> 02:36.865
- Wait, wait, wait. What are you doing?
- We're just gonna buy some diapers.

02:36.949 --> 02:38.492
It'll just take a second.

02:38.492 --> 02:41.870
- This is Costco.
- Yeah, which is where we buy diapers.

02:41.954 --> 02:43.038
Since when?

02:43.038 --> 02:46.041
Do you remember when we adopted
that baby a few months back?

02:46.041 --> 02:47.584
Since then.

02:50.087 --> 02:51.255
Mitchell is a snob.

02:51.255 --> 02:54.049
No, no, I'm discerning.

02:54.049 --> 02:57.010
Official slogan for snobs.

02:57.094 --> 02:59.137
When we first met
he wouldn't even look at me because

02:59.221 --> 03:04.560
I was a hick from the farm in Missouri
and he's a big city mouse.

03:04.560 --> 03:07.646
- Who says "city mouse"?
- Country mice.

03:08.772 --> 03:10.732
<i>Ground ball to short. Sanchez...</i>

03:10.816 --> 03:13.819
- I think I'm gonna go wait in the car.
- Okay.

03:13.944 --> 03:15.988
Hey, if you're on your way out,
can you grab the garbage?

03:16.113 --> 03:17.906
- I got it.
- Okay. We got it.

03:17.990 --> 03:19.324
<i>Still one out left.</i>

03:19.408 --> 03:20.534
He's a little jumpy.

03:20.534 --> 03:24.454
Go figure, a teenage boy doesn't want
to hang out with his girlfriend's dad.

03:24.538 --> 03:25.956
I thought we were past all that.

03:25.956 --> 03:29.918
I'm all about...
I'm all about taking it to the next level.

03:30.002 --> 03:32.546
Really? I thought you were
all about keeping it real.

03:32.546 --> 03:34.840
Yes, but the whole point
of keeping it real

03:34.840 --> 03:36.216
is so you can take it to the next level.

03:36.300 --> 03:37.885
Did you really not know that?

03:37.885 --> 03:40.679
You haven't exactly taken it
to the next level with my dad.

03:40.679 --> 03:42.097
What are you talking about?

03:42.181 --> 03:43.724
We've been married for 16 years,

03:43.724 --> 03:46.018
and you still walk
on eggshells around him.

03:46.018 --> 03:51.231
What? Are you kidding?
Jay and I are total buds!

03:55.235 --> 03:57.029
You want to just hang out?

03:57.696 --> 04:01.658
Brought six friends. So let's...

04:20.052 --> 04:22.554
Manny brought his favorite game
to play with Luke.

04:22.638 --> 04:23.722
It's called Empire.

04:23.722 --> 04:27.017
You use strategy to expand territories
and take over the world.

04:27.851 --> 04:30.103
Luke is going to love that.
He's out back playing.

04:30.187 --> 04:32.481
Do you need me to get you
something while I'm out shopping?

04:32.481 --> 04:34.316
That's such a nice offer,
but I think we're good. Thanks.

04:34.316 --> 04:37.236
Okay, what about this?

04:37.236 --> 04:39.279
You don't even say hello
to Gloria and Manny?

04:39.363 --> 04:42.741
Hi, Gloria and Manny.
Okay, Mom, what about this?

04:42.741 --> 04:45.869
- No. You're wearing a dress.
- Mom, come on.

04:45.953 --> 04:48.330
What? It's gonna kill you
to look like a girl for one afternoon?

04:48.330 --> 04:51.458
But it's a wedding for some friend of
yours I never even heard of.

04:51.542 --> 04:54.253
It's non-negotiable.
You could borrow a dress of Haley's again.

04:54.253 --> 04:58.632
No, that sends an ugly message
that I'm Haley.

04:58.632 --> 05:01.385
You know, instead of trying to force me
to wear a dress,

05:01.385 --> 05:04.513
why don't you worry about getting
Luke to wear some pants?

05:05.430 --> 05:08.517
What? Why does he do this?

05:10.519 --> 05:13.480
Luke! Pants! Come on.

05:18.402 --> 05:20.112
<i>Jay and I are buds, for sure.</i>

05:20.112 --> 05:27.119
But with kind of an invisible asterisk.
He's not the... He's not a talker.

05:27.119 --> 05:29.913
Or a hugger.

05:29.997 --> 05:34.835
Once, he ran over my foot with his car.
To be fair, he had just given up smoking.

05:34.835 --> 05:37.504
But basically, we're buds.

05:39.298 --> 05:43.093
Do you have to just stand there?
You're making me feel uneasy.

05:43.177 --> 05:44.219
Oh.

05:46.889 --> 05:48.307
For God's sake, sit here.

05:48.307 --> 05:51.852
Here, hold this wing like this
while I adjust this.

05:51.852 --> 05:55.981
- Okay.
- Come on. Here.

06:05.365 --> 06:06.825
Not too hard.

06:09.453 --> 06:11.955
Alex, why don't you come
shopping with me?

06:12.039 --> 06:14.041
Maybe I can help you find something
that you like.

06:14.750 --> 06:17.503
That's a really nice offer,
but it's not really her thing.

06:17.836 --> 06:19.963
Actually, I'd love to go.

06:20.047 --> 06:23.634
See, you don't know what my thing is.
You have no idea what my thing is.

06:24.176 --> 06:25.511
I know what your thing is.

06:25.511 --> 06:26.929
Your thing is to provoke,

06:26.929 --> 06:29.806
just like your sister's thing
is to never come out of her room.

06:29.890 --> 06:33.185
And your brother's thing...
There's your brother's thing.

06:33.185 --> 06:37.231
Luke! Put them on! Mmm-hmm.

06:37.981 --> 06:39.399
<i>The thing about me and Jay,</i>

06:39.483 --> 06:44.988
is our relationship's always been stuck
in that primal place where it started.

06:45.072 --> 06:47.491
You know, he's the old silverback
protecting his females.

06:47.491 --> 06:50.118
Then along comes
this younger, stronger gorilla

06:50.202 --> 06:51.662
swinging in, beating his chest.

06:51.662 --> 06:54.748
You know naturally,
the ape-ladies come running,

06:54.748 --> 06:56.875
presenting their nice scarlet behinds.

06:56.959 --> 06:59.878
Papa ape wants to stop all that,
but he can't.

06:59.962 --> 07:02.881
You know, that's life. I'm not the enemy.

07:04.424 --> 07:06.593
The enemy is poachers.

07:11.348 --> 07:13.225
That'll do it. Don't touch it.

07:18.522 --> 07:20.107
All right.

07:24.903 --> 07:26.947
- You want to go fly it?
- Sure.

07:30.200 --> 07:33.579
Hey, I got the toothpaste
and the soap.

07:33.704 --> 07:36.331
Good, now we can open that general store.

07:36.415 --> 07:37.749
I thought
we were just here to get diapers.

07:37.833 --> 07:38.959
We had a saying on the farm,

07:38.959 --> 07:41.086
"As long as you're bringing
the mule to market, you..."

07:41.170 --> 07:43.797
I feel you rolling your eyes at me.

07:43.922 --> 07:46.341
We met at one of Pepper's
legendary game nights.

07:46.425 --> 07:48.760
I remember Mitchell
because he kept rolling his eyes,

07:48.844 --> 07:50.470
every time
I would get a little boisterous.

07:50.554 --> 07:52.764
- I did not.
- A little bit.

07:53.599 --> 07:55.434
Yeah. Maybe a little bit.

07:55.434 --> 07:59.313
Anyway, we were playing charades
and I had no idea how to act out my clue.

07:59.313 --> 08:02.816
And all I could think of to do was...

08:02.900 --> 08:07.112
And without missing a beat, Cam says... <i>- Casablanca.</i>

08:07.196 --> 08:11.867
All I did was this. <i>- Casablanca. Casablanca.</i>

08:12.159 --> 08:13.994
Can we just please get the diapers
and get out of here?

08:13.994 --> 08:16.288
Fine, but I want to stop by
the wine section first.

08:16.288 --> 08:19.166
Wait, there's a wine section?

08:19.166 --> 08:21.126
Yeah, a really good one.
Just past the tires.

08:21.210 --> 08:23.462
No way, they do not have...

08:23.587 --> 08:28.592
Oh, my God. Oh, my, Cam, Cam,
the paper shredder I wanted.

08:28.717 --> 08:30.844
Confetti and crosscut. Yeah.

08:34.139 --> 08:36.725
- Oh, my God, amazing.
- Yeah.

08:39.978 --> 08:43.232
Cam, what is this place?

08:46.777 --> 08:49.947
Those cookies smell like heaven.
Your own recipe?

08:50.072 --> 08:51.990
No, I just throw them in the oven.

08:52.074 --> 08:54.743
And added the secret ingredient of caring?

08:55.202 --> 08:56.453
Sure.

08:56.787 --> 08:58.705
So, you and Luke having a good time?

08:58.789 --> 09:01.124
I don't know.
He won't come out of his box.

09:02.042 --> 09:05.337
Maybe I'll just stay here
and spend some time with my sister.

09:05.337 --> 09:08.966
Oh. Right, I guess technically
I would be your stepsister.

09:08.966 --> 09:11.343
My mother says we are never
to use the word "step"

09:11.468 --> 09:14.096
because it means "not real,"
and we are a real family.

09:14.096 --> 09:15.180
Mmm.

09:16.223 --> 09:18.559
So, what is the matter, Claire?

09:20.227 --> 09:22.396
- What?
- You seem sad.

09:24.231 --> 09:27.067
It's just stuff with Alex.
You know, kid stuff.

09:27.067 --> 09:30.946
Ugh! Kids. You don't have to tell me.
My school is full of them.

09:34.074 --> 09:37.411
I was thinking after lunch
we can go and do a little shopping.

09:37.411 --> 09:41.164
- I'm not getting a dress.
- I don't care. I'm not your mother.

09:41.248 --> 09:44.334
- I know. You're my grandmother.
- Step-grandmother.

09:45.294 --> 09:48.338
Anyway, today,
think of me as a girlfriend.

09:48.422 --> 09:51.341
Two girls out for an afternoon of fun.

09:52.426 --> 09:55.470
What do you usually do
with your girlfriends?

09:55.554 --> 09:59.308
I don't know,
we go out, we talk, drink wine.

09:59.308 --> 10:01.018
- Can I drink wine?
- No.

10:01.935 --> 10:02.978
Some friend.

10:02.978 --> 10:06.273
Well, you can still
talk to me about anything.

10:06.273 --> 10:08.942
Yeah, adults always say that,
but they don't mean it.

10:09.526 --> 10:12.779
When my mom says
I can ask her anything, I really can't.

10:12.863 --> 10:14.573
She just freaks out.

10:15.115 --> 10:18.243
I won't freak out. Shoot.

10:18.994 --> 10:20.704
Okay.

10:20.704 --> 10:24.082
- How many men have you slept with?
- Eight. Next.

10:29.796 --> 10:32.591
- Now can I try it?
- No.

10:33.967 --> 10:36.553
I should get one of those.
I've always loved planes.

10:36.637 --> 10:38.597
You know, if things had gone
a little differently in my life,

10:38.597 --> 10:39.806
I think I would have been a pilot.

10:41.433 --> 10:44.353
Hey, what would happen if you turned
the remote off and then back on real fast?

10:44.353 --> 10:46.688
Yeah, you'd have been a great pilot.

10:47.856 --> 10:50.108
So, can you do...
Can you do a loop-de-loop?

10:50.234 --> 10:53.195
- If I wanted to.
- No way! Can I try it?

10:53.320 --> 10:54.404
No.

10:57.366 --> 11:00.452
I can see why you like this.
It's so peaceful.

11:01.078 --> 11:05.374
It's like the whole world
just disappears out here.

11:07.835 --> 11:10.212
- I remember, this one summer...
- I'll tell you what.

11:10.212 --> 11:12.130
There's another trick
called "threading the needle."

11:12.214 --> 11:13.924
I used to do it with Claire and Mitch
when they were kids.

11:13.924 --> 11:15.676
- You want to try it?
- How does it go?

11:15.801 --> 11:17.886
You grab one of those hoops over there,

11:17.970 --> 11:22.391
and go to the far, far, far
end of the field and stand there.

11:22.391 --> 11:24.142
And I fly the plane through it.

11:25.018 --> 11:28.647
That sounds awesome!
And then I get a chance flying it?

11:28.647 --> 11:29.940
- No.
- Okay.

11:42.828 --> 11:45.664
- How's this?
- Not far enough. Go on.

11:45.664 --> 11:46.915
Okay. Further down.

11:46.999 --> 11:50.794
- You can't go too far.
- Right. Okay, I get it. I get it.

11:56.216 --> 11:58.677
- How's this?
- Good.

11:58.677 --> 12:01.138
Now, stand still. Don't move.

12:01.263 --> 12:03.348
Okay, let's do it.

12:06.393 --> 12:10.939
I love it. I love it!

12:22.034 --> 12:24.328
- You drove a plane into my face.
- You must have moved.

12:24.328 --> 12:26.705
- I told you to stay still.
- I didn't move.

12:26.705 --> 12:28.916
Try not to talk.
I wanna make sure nothing's broken.

12:31.168 --> 12:35.506
Alex and I can't just disagree.
She has to turn everything into a fight.

12:35.714 --> 12:39.551
Hmm. A strong, independent woman.
Sounds like somebody else I know.

12:40.302 --> 12:43.722
I was never hostile, though.
This whole thing with the dress,

12:43.722 --> 12:45.307
never had this problem with Haley.

12:45.766 --> 12:48.644
Maybe Alex doesn't want to compete
with her big sister.

12:48.644 --> 12:51.188
Maybe she's trying
to create her own identity.

12:51.188 --> 12:54.858
- Put her in a dress, and she disappears.
- For one afternoon.

12:54.942 --> 12:57.236
I wouldn't give up being myself
for even one second.

12:58.320 --> 12:59.446
Wow.

12:59.571 --> 13:02.199
Sometimes it's hard to remember
you're only 10 years old.

13:02.199 --> 13:04.117
- And three quarters.
- Yeah.

13:06.370 --> 13:08.288
Hello? <i>- Hey, it's Mitchell.</i>

13:08.372 --> 13:09.998
<i>- Do you guys eat olives?</i>
- Olives?

13:10.082 --> 13:11.917
<i>- Really good olives?</i>
- Yeah.

13:11.917 --> 13:13.627
You got it.

13:13.627 --> 13:16.255
Mitchell, I found the diapers.
They're over here.

13:16.255 --> 13:19.633
Cameron, guess what I found? Coffins.

13:19.633 --> 13:21.426
They sell baby formula
and they sell coffins.

13:21.510 --> 13:24.179
You can literally buy everything
you need, from birth to death.

13:24.263 --> 13:26.515
Oh, my God, look at these diapers.

13:26.515 --> 13:29.518
Look how cheap they are.
You know what we should do?

13:29.518 --> 13:31.436
We should get enough
for like the next year or two, right?

13:31.520 --> 13:35.232
- Where would we keep them?
- They sell sheds.

13:35.691 --> 13:38.652
Really? You want to buy a diaper shed?
We're those guys now?

13:38.652 --> 13:40.571
The guys with a diaper shed?

13:40.737 --> 13:43.156
- Just grab two more.
- I'm not grabbing two more, Mitchell.

13:43.240 --> 13:46.159
- It's time to go.
- Come on, come on, we need...

13:46.243 --> 13:48.912
Hey, excuse me.
Where did you get that flat bed thing?

13:48.996 --> 13:50.956
- Over there.
- Go grab one of those.

13:51.164 --> 13:52.875
- Really?
- Yeah. Get two.

13:57.171 --> 13:58.755
I'm in the applesauce aisle.

13:59.131 --> 14:01.341
So, anyway,
after charades, we went out for coffee,

14:01.425 --> 14:06.763
and I learned that he loves art,
he plays the piano, he speaks French.

14:07.890 --> 14:12.102
- You see, I misjudged him.
- I'm sort of like Costco.

14:12.269 --> 14:15.272
I'm big, I'm not fancy,
and I dare you to not like me.

14:15.272 --> 14:17.983
Yeah, and I'm kind of more like that... Um...

14:18.817 --> 14:21.820
What is the name of that little shop
we went to in Paris?

14:21.904 --> 14:23.739
You are such a snob.

14:26.575 --> 14:28.285
<i>Casablanca.</i>

14:29.745 --> 14:35.667
I have a small flower on my ankle,
and a tiny little butterfly on my thigh.

14:36.168 --> 14:38.879
- How high up?
- Pretty high.

14:38.879 --> 14:42.257
Did you do it to look sexy?
No, did you do it for a guy?

14:42.382 --> 14:46.053
- Does Grandpa like it?
- No. No. And, yes.

14:46.053 --> 14:47.221
That's gross.

14:48.305 --> 14:50.891
- Let's go back to your piercings.
- No, no, no.

14:50.891 --> 14:54.645
I've answered enough of your questions.
Now it's your turn to answer one.

14:55.187 --> 14:58.398
- What is it?
- Why you don't want to wear a dress?

14:58.482 --> 15:01.735
Because I don't want to look like Haley
and her stupid friends.

15:01.944 --> 15:04.321
I wear dresses
and I don't look like Haley.

15:04.321 --> 15:07.741
You are Haley, just 40 years older.

15:07.866 --> 15:09.201
- Ten.
- Twenty.

15:09.201 --> 15:12.246
Deal.
Alex, why are you fighting me on this?

15:12.246 --> 15:16.500
It doesn't matter if I dress up.
I'm not pretty like Haley and you.

15:16.500 --> 15:19.503
- That's ridiculous. You're beautiful.
- I'm not.

15:19.503 --> 15:22.297
But that's okay, I'm the smart one.

15:22.714 --> 15:26.093
Hmm. The cute busboy
doesn't know that you're smart.

15:26.218 --> 15:27.803
- What?
- He's been smiling at you

15:27.803 --> 15:30.347
- every time he comes to the table.
- He does not.

15:30.347 --> 15:33.183
Why do you think
we are the only people with bread?

15:34.977 --> 15:39.648
Look, one day you're going
to want to date a cute guy like that.

15:40.023 --> 15:43.193
And when that day comes,
you're gonna want to look beautiful,

15:43.485 --> 15:45.070
and then you'll wear a dress.

15:47.781 --> 15:49.366
So, you ever kiss another girl?

15:49.950 --> 15:52.119
That's no way to talk
to your grandmother.

15:52.744 --> 15:55.998
Was my mom hard on me growing up?
Yeah, she was.

15:55.998 --> 15:57.165
But, you know what?

15:57.249 --> 16:00.669
Back then, everything was Betty Friedan
and Gloria Steinem.

16:00.794 --> 16:03.255
They didn't understand...
<i>Hola!</i> We're back.

16:03.255 --> 16:05.382
Hello.
- Hey, how'd it go?

16:05.382 --> 16:08.260
It was great. Did you have fun with Luke?

16:08.260 --> 16:10.804
- Well, not...
- We had a great time.

16:11.180 --> 16:16.894
Alex, I've been thinking and if you
don't want to wear a dress to the wedding,

16:16.894 --> 16:18.103
it's not the end of the world.

16:18.562 --> 16:21.231
It's all right, I bought one.

16:23.192 --> 16:24.610
Do you see how she has to provoke me?

16:25.360 --> 16:27.154
We'll talk about it next week.
Claire!

16:28.447 --> 16:32.451
Coming through. Coming through.
Easy. Easy, fella.

16:32.451 --> 16:35.704
- I need to rest my face.
- You're fine. You'll be all right.

16:35.704 --> 16:40.167
Oh, my God! Dad?
Little accident. Nothing big.

16:40.167 --> 16:42.586
- I was in a plane crash.
- What happened?

16:42.586 --> 16:44.630
We were threading the needle
and somebody moved.

16:44.630 --> 16:47.758
No, I didn't. You did it on purpose.

16:47.758 --> 16:50.761
That's the painkiller talking,
he's a little loopy.

16:50.761 --> 16:51.929
How bad is it?

16:51.929 --> 16:53.889
Well, the wing is cracked,
the propeller's bent.

16:53.889 --> 16:55.474
- But I can...
- I mean Phil.

16:55.474 --> 16:58.185
- I was in a plane crash.
- Thanks, Dad.

16:58.894 --> 17:01.271
I didn't ask him to be there.
He insisted.

17:01.355 --> 17:02.856
He took a chance, this is what happened.

17:02.981 --> 17:04.525
Kind of like the time
you ran over his foot?

17:04.525 --> 17:06.318
- You ran over his foot?
- That was an accident.

17:06.318 --> 17:09.613
You know, Dad, you did it on purpose.
We all saw the tire marks on the lawn.

17:09.613 --> 17:11.698
I had just quit smoking.

17:11.782 --> 17:12.866
See, you're upsetting your husband.

17:12.950 --> 17:14.368
- Water.
- I'll get it.

17:18.830 --> 17:22.918
- You okay?
- Gloria, thank God you're here.

17:22.918 --> 17:26.588
- Don't worry I'm here, too.
- Who's this?

17:27.673 --> 17:29.049
It wasn't my fault.

17:29.049 --> 17:31.593
I have seen you thread the needle
a million times.

17:31.677 --> 17:33.804
- You never miss.
- Yeah. I must be getting old.

17:33.804 --> 17:36.098
Why don't you just admit it?
You never liked Phil.

17:36.098 --> 17:37.850
Put that down. You do not get a cookie.

17:37.850 --> 17:41.937
I like Phil. It's just that sometimes
he tries too hard, you know?

17:41.937 --> 17:44.731
And it's just kind of irritating.

17:44.815 --> 17:48.235
Okay, maybe he tries too hard
because you make zero effort with him.

17:48.235 --> 17:50.487
You know what?
In the 16 years that we've been married,

17:50.571 --> 17:54.116
have you one time told him
that you liked him?

17:54.116 --> 17:58.078
- Not in those exact words, no.
- No. Not in any words, Dad.

17:58.078 --> 18:00.289
How do you think that makes me feel?

18:02.082 --> 18:03.792
You never told your son that you love him?

18:03.876 --> 18:06.587
Whoa, whoa! When did we jump to love?

18:06.587 --> 18:08.297
And he's technically not my son.

18:08.589 --> 18:10.591
Ha! So, that means that
you don't love Manny, either?

18:10.591 --> 18:11.717
Sure I do.

18:11.884 --> 18:15.429
I mean, believe me, when I was in that
park, I really wished Manny was there.

18:15.429 --> 18:19.433
For what? So that you could fly
the plane into his head? Huh?

18:20.767 --> 18:23.145
Dad, thanks so much
for bringing Phil home.

18:23.145 --> 18:27.232
I found one of your little flaps
in his hair. So...

18:29.985 --> 18:31.987
Actually, this is called an aileron.
It controls the...

18:31.987 --> 18:35.699
Because that's what matters right now.
Bye, Dad.

18:46.251 --> 18:47.920
Hey, Phil. Jay.

18:52.674 --> 18:54.384
- Ow!
- What, are you made of china?

18:56.470 --> 19:00.724
Phil, I just want you to know, I'm sorry.

19:00.724 --> 19:04.019
- And whether I missed, or you moved...
- I didn't.

19:04.144 --> 19:08.607
Either way, I just want to say
that I like you.

19:08.607 --> 19:11.360
- Really?
- Yeah.

19:11.360 --> 19:12.986
What do you like about me?

19:16.615 --> 19:21.787
You're a nice guy, you try real hard.

19:22.079 --> 19:23.497
I do.

19:24.331 --> 19:26.542
- You're a good dad.
- I am a good dad.

19:26.542 --> 19:28.836
Come here. Come here, you.

19:30.671 --> 19:32.297
This feels so right.

19:35.050 --> 19:36.385
What's going on?

19:36.385 --> 19:40.264
There was a little accident, but Jay's
telling Phil how much he loves him.

19:41.265 --> 19:43.141
- Well, that's nice for Phil.
- That's great,

19:43.225 --> 19:45.018
since he's never said
anything like that to my boyfriend.

19:45.102 --> 19:47.020
- Let it go.
- No, it's not okay.

19:47.104 --> 19:49.773
Mitch is right. You go in there, too, Cam.
Come on.

19:49.857 --> 19:51.775
- You're kidding?
- Jay!

19:51.859 --> 19:54.069
I'm going to get this.
- Come on in, Cam.

19:54.069 --> 19:55.571
A little hug?
- Get in here.

19:55.571 --> 19:58.490
Say... Say it. Say it.

19:58.574 --> 20:00.284
I like you, too, Cam.

20:00.284 --> 20:02.536
- What do you like about him?
- Jeez.

20:02.536 --> 20:06.373
- Where did you get that camera?
- Only the greatest store on earth.

20:07.165 --> 20:08.792
Thanks, Dad.

20:08.876 --> 20:13.380
Manny, picture, get in there, too.
Get in here, <i>mi amigo.</i>

20:13.380 --> 20:15.257
Stay still, say "cheese."

20:15.382 --> 20:17.509
Don't push it.
Cheese!

20:18.343 --> 20:19.928
Cheese.

20:22.014 --> 20:23.640
Oh, boy.

20:24.057 --> 20:27.227
Doesn't it feel like these arms
could go around the world?

20:27.311 --> 20:28.854
I think I strained something.

20:32.357 --> 20:34.276
I always wanted a daughter.

20:34.276 --> 20:40.157
To dress her up in pretty dresses,
do her hair, her nails, her makeup.

20:42.242 --> 20:43.744
No one knows this,

20:43.744 --> 20:47.206
but for the first year of his life,
I made up Manny like a girl

20:47.206 --> 20:49.208
and told everybody
that he was my daughter.

20:50.918 --> 20:52.836
But just for a few times.

20:52.920 --> 20:54.838
I didn't want to mess with his head.

20:54.963 --> 20:56.131
When he found the pictures,

20:56.215 --> 20:59.176
I told him that it was
his twin sister who died.
