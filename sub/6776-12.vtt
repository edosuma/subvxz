03:23.130 --> 03:24.950
HEY, ENCYCLOPEDIA BROWN.

03:24.960 --> 03:26.359
YOU'RE SNOOPING ?

03:26.360 --> 03:27.452
NO, IT WAS OPEN.

03:27.460 --> 03:30.395
"FUCK ME HARDER,
SURFER BOY,

03:30.400 --> 03:32.322
"WITH YOUR FAT
LI'I'I'LE CROOKED COCK

03:32.330 --> 03:36.027
AND YOUR "PLEASE TELL ME
YOU'RE NOT SERIOUS"
SHAVED BALLS."

03:36.030 --> 03:38.498
THIS IS PRETI'Y
OUT THERE, BREN.

03:38.500 --> 03:39.853
NOT REALLY.

03:39.860 --> 03:42.454
HAVE YOU EVER HAD SEX
WITH TWO MEN AT THE SAME TIME ?

03:42.460 --> 03:44.098
HAVE YOU EVER HAD SEX
WITH TWO WOMEN ?

03:44.100 --> 03:47.092
AND ONCE AGAIN, YOU REFUSE
TO ANSWER MY QUESTION.

03:47.100 --> 03:49.227
HAVE YOU ?

03:49.230 --> 03:51.050
YES.

03:51.060 --> 03:52.391
HOW WAS IT ?

03:52.400 --> 03:54.197
WHICH TIME ?

03:54.200 --> 03:56.919
"HE PUTS ON HIS
YIN YANG BASEBALL CAP

03:56.930 --> 03:58.591
"AND ASKS FOR
HER NUMBER.

03:58.600 --> 04:00.352
"WHY", SHE SAYS,
"SO WE CAN DATE ?"

04:00.360 --> 04:02.191
WELL, SHE HAS A POINT.

04:02.200 --> 04:06.057
"ON HIS WAY OUT HE SAYS, "LATE"
IN THAT STUPID, SURFER WAY.

04:06.060 --> 04:07.789
"LATE.

04:07.800 --> 04:10.451
"SHE FEELS SAD
FOR ABOUT HALF A SECOND,

04:10.460 --> 04:12.690
"THEN THE FAMILIAR RELIEF
WHEN SHE HEARS THE DOOR SHUT.

04:12.700 --> 04:16.522
WHY DOES IT ALWAYS FEEL
SO GOOD WHEN THEY LEAVE ?"

04:18.260 --> 04:19.591
WHAT ?

04:19.600 --> 04:21.295
I LOVE IT,
I THINK IT'S GREAT.

04:21.300 --> 04:22.995
YES, IT'S JUST REALLY, REALLY
WEIRD HEARING IT OUT LOUD.

04:23.000 --> 04:25.150
I DON'T CARE
IF YOU LOVE IT.

04:25.160 --> 04:26.559
I DIDN'T WRITE IT
FOR YOU.

04:26.560 --> 04:29.120
YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK ?

04:29.130 --> 04:31.553
I THINK YOU'RE ANGRY WITH ME
ABOUT SLEEPING WITH LISA.

04:31.560 --> 04:33.027
YEAH.

04:33.030 --> 04:34.725
SO, MAYBE YOU'RE
GETTING BACK AT ME

04:34.730 --> 04:36.425
BY WRITING ABOUT YOU
BEING WITH SOMEONE ELSE.

04:36.430 --> 04:37.897
NATE, IT'S NOT
THAT SIMPLE.

04:37.900 --> 04:43.020
I STARTED WRITING THIS
LONG BEFORE I FOUND OUT

04:43.030 --> 04:44.793
ABOUT YOU AND LISA.

04:45.830 --> 04:49.493
SO, TELL ME.

04:49.500 --> 04:52.697
WHAT ELSE IS
IN THAT COMPUTER ?

04:52.700 --> 04:56.955
OR THIS COMPUTER.

04:58.400 --> 04:59.628
HMM ?

05:04.930 --> 05:07.421
TAYLOR, SOMEONE VERY IMPORTANT
IS COMING OVER TOMORROW.

05:07.430 --> 05:09.398
A VERY IMPORTANT FRIEND.

05:09.400 --> 05:11.550
AND WE NEED YOU TO BE
ON YOUR BEST BEHAVIOR.

05:11.560 --> 05:13.858
OH, YOU MEAN
A SOCIAL WORKER ?

05:13.860 --> 05:15.657
I'VE HAD THEM BEFORE.

05:15.660 --> 05:17.457
MRS. PASTORELLI
AND MR. SHIPLEY.

05:17.460 --> 05:19.894
HE SMELLED LIKE FRITOS
AND COUGHED A LOT.

05:19.900 --> 05:23.620
ME AND MY MOM,
WE USED TO CALL HIM
"MR. SHIT-FOR-BRAINS".

05:23.630 --> 05:27.020
HEY, I AM SICK AND TIRED
OF YOUR MOUTH, ALRIGHT ?

05:27.030 --> 05:28.895
WHEN YOU SPEAK
LIKE THAT,

05:28.900 --> 05:30.322
YOU'RE NOT SHOWING
ANY RESPECT FOR YOURSELF.

05:30.330 --> 05:31.695
AND BELIEVE ME,

05:31.700 --> 05:33.224
THERE ARE PLENTY OF PEOPLE
IN THIS WORLD

05:33.230 --> 05:35.050
THAT ARE NOT GONNA RESPECT YOU
WITHOUT YOU ADDING TO IT.

05:35.060 --> 05:37.449
DO YOU KNOW WHAT
I'M TALKING ABOUT ?

05:37.930 --> 05:39.420
YOU'RE GONNA
BE LATE FOR SCHOOL.

05:39.430 --> 05:41.318
GO BRUSH YOUR TEETH
SO WE CAN LEAVE.

05:46.860 --> 05:49.192
KEITH,
I DON'T THINK SHE--

05:49.200 --> 05:50.792
I DON'T WANT
TO HEAR IT.

05:50.800 --> 05:52.552
OH, BECAUSE I'M WHITE,
I COULDN'T POSSIBLY UNDERSTAND ?

05:52.560 --> 05:54.824
NO, BECAUSE YOU'RE GONNA
START SPOUTING ALL THAT

05:54.830 --> 05:56.593
CHILD PSYCHOLOGY BULLSHIT
YOU BEEN READING.

05:56.600 --> 05:57.953
IT'S NOT BULLSHIT,

05:57.960 --> 05:59.552
IT'S CALLED
THE WHOLE CHILD THEORY,

05:59.560 --> 06:01.198
AND IT'S ONLY
THE COLLECTIVE THOUGHTS

06:01.200 --> 06:04.351
OF SOME THE GREATEST
EDUCATORS AROUND, OKAY ?

06:04.360 --> 06:07.989
LE'I'I'ING HER KNOW THAT
WE LOVE HER FOR WHO SHE IS

06:08.000 --> 06:09.456
BUILDS TRUST.

06:09.460 --> 06:12.099
CONSTANTLY SCOLDING HER FOR
BEHAVIOR WE DON'T LIKE DOESN'T.

06:16.400 --> 06:17.549
WHAT ?

06:17.560 --> 06:19.255
I DON'T KNOW HOW
WE'RE GONNA RAISE A CHILD.

06:19.260 --> 06:20.796
WE JUST ARE, OKAY ?

06:20.800 --> 06:22.654
DAVID, THE BOARD STILL HASN'T
CLEARED ME ON THE SHOOTING.

06:22.660 --> 06:24.491
WE'RE GOING TO GET
THE GUARDIANSHIP,

06:24.500 --> 06:26.798
AND WE'RE GOING
TO BE GOOD PARENTS.

06:28.360 --> 06:31.329
TAYLOR, HOW LONG IS IT GONNA
TAKE YOU TO BRUSH YOUR TEETH ?!

06:39.730 --> 06:42.392
I WOULD LIKE TO
GO ON RECORD AS SAYING

06:42.400 --> 06:44.925
I AM IN FULL SUPPORT OF YOU
GOING TO ART SCHOOL.

06:44.930 --> 06:46.955
CONSIDER IT RECORDED.

06:46.960 --> 06:50.396
BUT I'M JUST
TAKING A TOUR.

06:50.400 --> 06:52.095
LET'S NOT GET OUR PANTIES
IN A WAD OVER IT.

06:52.100 --> 06:53.624
OH,, THAT'S SUCH
AN UNPLEASANT EXPRESSION.

06:53.630 --> 06:55.427
I NEVER GOT
TO GO TO COLLEGE.

06:55.430 --> 06:56.897
DID YOU EVEN WANT TO ?

06:56.900 --> 06:58.925
I DID, I WANTED TO STUDY
FRENCH FEMINIST WRITERS.

06:58.930 --> 07:00.852
YOU'RE A FEMINIST, MOM ?

07:00.860 --> 07:03.522
FEMINISM MEANS BEING ACCEPTED
FOR WHO YOU ARE.

07:03.530 --> 07:05.828
I WANTED TO BE
A WIFE AND A MOTHER.

07:05.830 --> 07:08.390
I NEVER GAVE ANYTHING UP
TO BE A MOTHER OR A WIFE.

07:08.400 --> 07:10.129
IT WAS WHAT
I WANTED.

07:10.130 --> 07:11.927
I THOUGHT YOU JUST SAID
YOU GAVE UP GOING TO COLLEGE.

07:11.930 --> 07:13.898
WHY IS EVERY CONVERSATION
WITH YOU A TRAP ?

07:13.900 --> 07:14.924
SORRY.

07:14.930 --> 07:17.057
I'M SORRY,
BE A FEMINIST.

07:17.060 --> 07:18.322
WE CAN BOTH
BE FEMINISTS.

07:18.330 --> 07:20.651
CHECK IT OUT,
CINDY SHERMAN WENT HERE.

07:20.660 --> 07:22.855
WHOA, AND
BILLY CHENOWITH ?

07:22.860 --> 07:24.225
I NEVER KNEW THAT.

07:24.230 --> 07:25.549
BRENDA'S BROTHER ?

07:25.560 --> 07:27.289
THE ONE IN
THE MENTAL INSTITUTION ?

07:27.300 --> 07:28.653
HE'S OUT.

07:28.660 --> 07:30.150
IS HE CURED ?

07:30.160 --> 07:31.491
WHO KNOWS ?

07:31.500 --> 07:33.388
GOD, I HATE MY HAIR.

07:33.400 --> 07:37.552
WHEN I GO TO COLLEGE
I'M GONNA CUT IT ALL OFF
LIKE FELICITY.

07:37.560 --> 07:38.959
HAVE I MET HER ?

07:38.960 --> 07:42.896
YEAH, SHE WAS HERE
FOR DINNER ONCE.

07:49.360 --> 07:51.225
FEDERICO ?

07:51.230 --> 07:53.357
ARE YOU ALRIGHT ?

07:53.360 --> 07:54.998
YEAH, I'M FINE, DAVID.

07:55.000 --> 07:57.457
YOU KNOW HER ?

07:57.460 --> 08:00.520
MM-HMM, ABUELITA.

08:00.530 --> 08:01.849
IT MEANS GRANDMA.

08:01.860 --> 08:03.293
FEDERICO,
I'M SO SORRY.

08:03.300 --> 08:05.052
NO, NO, SHE'S NOT
REALLY MY GRANDMA,

08:05.060 --> 08:06.550
SHE'S JUST
SORT OF ADOPTED.

08:06.560 --> 08:08.926
SHE LIVED BY HERSELF,

08:08.930 --> 08:11.194
RIGHT ACROSS THE STREET FROM
ME AND VANESSA BEFORE WE MOVED.

08:11.200 --> 08:14.920
I USED TO CLEAN THE LEAVES
OUT OF HER GU'I'I'ERS,

08:14.930 --> 08:18.149
AND BRING HER TRASH CANS
BACK UP THE DRIVEWAY,

08:18.160 --> 08:20.151
NOTHING BIG,
JUST WHEN I WAS DOING MINE.

08:20.160 --> 08:23.220
WE USED TO INVITE HER TO ALL
THE KIDS' BIRTHDAY PARTIES.

08:23.230 --> 08:25.221
SHE WOULD SIT
IN THIS FOLDING CHAIR,

08:25.230 --> 08:29.599
JUST HAPPY TO BE THERE,

08:29.600 --> 08:31.420
WITH A BIG SMILE
ON HER FACE.

08:33.360 --> 08:34.998
THAT'S SWEET.

08:35.000 --> 08:37.594
IS THAT THE PRE-NEED
SHE AND I DID TOGETHER ?

08:37.600 --> 08:39.625
YEAH.

08:41.100 --> 08:43.421
THIS A NEW RULE ?

08:43.430 --> 08:45.318
WE CAN WEAR
OUR PAJAMAS TO WORK ?

08:45.330 --> 08:47.491
SORRY, I LIVE
AT KEITH'S NOW.

08:47.500 --> 08:49.695
I DON'T KNOW WHERE
HALF MY STUFF IS.

08:49.700 --> 08:51.554
OH, YAY.

08:51.560 --> 08:52.595
WHAT ?

08:52.600 --> 08:54.693
SHE WANTS THE OUR LADY
OF GUADALUPE CASKET,

08:54.700 --> 08:56.053
I LOVE THAT ONE.

08:59.730 --> 09:01.493
KEITH.

09:01.500 --> 09:04.549
LISTEN, WE HEARD BACK FROM
THE USE OF FORCE REVIEW BOARD

09:04.560 --> 09:05.891
ABOUT YOUR SHOOTING.

09:05.900 --> 09:09.324
I'M SORRY TO BE THE ONE
TO HAVE TO TELL YOU THIS, BUT...

09:09.330 --> 09:11.525
YOU'RE BEING
BROUGHT UP ON CHARGES.

09:11.530 --> 09:13.919
TURNS OUT ALL THE PERP HAD
WAS A TOY PISTOL.

09:13.930 --> 09:17.991
THERE'S ALSO EVIDENCE TO SUGGEST
THAT IF THE PERP HADN'T DIED,

09:18.000 --> 09:21.356
HE MIGHT HAVE INVENTED
A CLEAN BURNING ALTERNATIVE
TO FOSSIL FUELS,

09:21.360 --> 09:23.954
REDUCING OUR DEPENDENCE
ON IMPORTED ENERGY SOURCES,

09:23.960 --> 09:26.690
THUS ENDING THE CONFLICT
IN THE MIDDLE EAST

09:26.700 --> 09:28.691
AND DEFLECTING THE HORROR
OF THE IMPENDING WORLD WAR !

09:28.700 --> 09:30.691
IT'S GOOD.

09:30.700 --> 09:34.591
THEY DECIDED
IT WAS A GOOD SHOOTING.

09:37.830 --> 09:39.525
THANK YOU.

09:40.600 --> 09:41.953
CONGRATULATIONS.

09:47.630 --> 09:50.793
( phone ringing )

09:51.760 --> 09:53.955
HEY, BABY.

09:53.960 --> 09:55.029
Hey.

09:55.030 --> 09:56.429
WELL, THE BOARD RULED.

09:56.430 --> 09:58.022
I'M OFF THE HOOK.

09:58.030 --> 09:59.292
OH, THANK GOD.

09:59.300 --> 10:01.029
I'LL TALK
TO YOU LATER.

10:01.030 --> 10:02.759
Love you, bye.

10:08.830 --> 10:10.752
CLAIRE FISHER ?

10:10.760 --> 10:12.455
HOW'D YOU KNOW ?

10:12.460 --> 10:15.452
YOU DON'T LOOK LIKE
A MUJADEEP SIDDIQUI.

10:15.460 --> 10:17.655
I'M HENRY, I'LL BE
YOUR CRUISE DIRECTOR.

10:17.660 --> 10:19.059
EXCELLENT.

10:19.060 --> 10:20.527
LET'S GO.

10:21.630 --> 10:23.188
SO, LET ME GUESS,

10:23.200 --> 10:26.089
YOU WERE LIKE THE ONE
TOTAL WEIRDO OUTCAST
IN YOUR HIGH SCHOOL ?

10:26.100 --> 10:28.398
NOT THE ONLY ONE.

10:28.400 --> 10:30.391
BUT DEFINITELY
ONE OF THE TOP 10.

10:30.400 --> 10:32.698
I THINK THAT'S WHAT
ALL OF US ARE.

10:32.700 --> 10:35.225
I THINK
EVERY LAST FREAK

10:35.230 --> 10:37.448
OF EVERY LAST CALIFORNIA
HIGH SCHOOL WINDS UP HERE.

10:37.460 --> 10:39.894
WE'RE KIND OF THE ISLAND
OF MISFIT TOYS OF COLLEGES.

10:39.900 --> 10:43.119
CAN ANYONE
TAKE WELDING ?

10:43.130 --> 10:45.223
YOU HAVE TO,
IT'S A REQUIREMENT.

10:45.230 --> 10:48.393
HOW COOL THAT WELDING
IS A REQUIREMENT,

10:48.400 --> 10:50.288
NOT FUCKING CALCULUS,

10:50.300 --> 10:52.029
NOBODY'S GONNA BE LOOKING AT
MY MATH GRADES TO GET IN HERE.

10:52.030 --> 10:54.225
WELL, EVEN THOUGH
YOU DON'T NEED THE GRADES

10:54.230 --> 10:56.425
YOU STILL GOTTA MAKE@(OTAL SURE
YOU ROCK THE APPLICATION THING.

10:56.430 --> 10:57.852
YEAH, DEFINITELY.

10:57.860 --> 10:58.895
NO, SERIOUSLY.

10:58.900 --> 11:00.390
A LOT OF PEOPLE WANT
TO GO TO SCHOOL HERE

11:00.400 --> 11:02.220
SO, IT'S NOT LIKE,
A TOTAL SLEEPWALK TO GET IN.

11:02.230 --> 11:05.529
YOUR ESSAY, YOUR PORTFOLIO,
ALL OF THAT STUFF COUNTS.

11:05.530 --> 11:07.521
YOUR LETTERS
OF RECOMMENDATION.

11:07.530 --> 11:09.293
WHO DO YOU KNOW ?

11:09.300 --> 11:11.450
UH, NOBODY.

11:11.460 --> 11:14.156
WELL, I SORTA KNOW
BILLY CHENOWITH.

11:14.160 --> 11:16.094
AH, HE'S OKAY.

11:16.100 --> 11:17.954
PERSONALLY, I THINK
EVERYTHING HE DOES,

11:17.960 --> 11:20.292
GREGORY CREWDSON DID BETTER,
EXCEPT YEARS AGO.

11:20.300 --> 11:24.623
BUT THE ALUMNI THING
SHOULD WORK IN YOUR FAVOR.

11:26.700 --> 11:29.260
THIS ONE'S CALLED
"JESUS BALLS."

11:29.260 --> 11:31.797
FIRST YEAR STUDENT.

11:58.500 --> 12:00.320
NO, THAT'S FINE,

12:00.330 --> 12:01.797
WE DON'T HAVE TO
GO OUT TONIGHT.

12:01.800 --> 12:02.949
OKAY.

12:02.960 --> 12:04.655
ALTHOUGH,
WE DID DECIDE

12:04.660 --> 12:06.958
THAT WE WOULD GET TOGETHER
EVERY OTHER NIGHT.

12:06.960 --> 12:08.154
OKAY.

12:08.160 --> 12:09.422
BUT THIS IS
ACTUALLY BETTER,

12:09.430 --> 12:10.852
BECAUSE NOW WE CAN
GO OUT SATURDAY,

12:10.860 --> 12:13.522
THEN MONDAY, WEDNESDAY,
AND FRIDAY OF NEXT WEEK.

12:13.530 --> 12:15.555
OH, WAIT.

12:15.560 --> 12:18.893
THEN WE CAN'T BE TOGETHER
NEXT SATURDAY.

12:18.900 --> 12:20.697
OKAY.

12:20.700 --> 12:22.452
SO, TRUTH BE TOLD,

12:22.460 --> 12:24.553
EVERY OTHER DAY
ISN'T A WORKABLE PLAN.

12:24.560 --> 12:28.599
I THINK WE SHOULD DECIDE ON
A NUMBER OF DAYS PER WEEK,

12:28.600 --> 12:30.989
SAY, THREE DAYS A WEEK,
OR FOUR DAYS A WEEK--

12:31.000 --> 12:32.319
THREE DAYS A WEEK.

12:32.330 --> 12:35.822
RIGHT, OR FOUR DAYS A WEEK,
AND THEN CHOOSE THOSE FOUR DAYS,

12:35.830 --> 12:37.991
ALWAYS MAKING SURE
WE INCLUDE SATURDAYS,

12:38.000 --> 12:40.753
BECAUSE WHO WANTS TO STAY ALONE
ON A SATURDAY, RIGHT ?

12:40.760 --> 12:43.593
WHATEVER YOU DECIDE.

12:44.460 --> 12:45.893
NIKOLAI.

12:45.900 --> 12:48.027
DON'T LET ME TALK YOU INTO
SOMETHING YOU DON'T WANT TO DO.

12:48.030 --> 12:49.554
NO, IS FINE.

12:49.560 --> 12:52.996
GOOD, LET ME GO
LOOK AT A CALENDAR.

12:56.160 --> 12:59.493
SO, TELL ME EVERYTHING.

12:59.500 --> 13:02.719
WHAT DOES THE HUMAN FRYMASTER
LOOK LIKE ?

13:02.730 --> 13:04.823
THE CREMATORY ?

13:04.830 --> 13:09.324
WELL, IT'S
A BIG STEEL THING

13:09.330 --> 13:10.922
IN A BIG ROOM.

13:10.930 --> 13:12.898
HOW DOES IT WORK,
EXACTLY ?

13:12.900 --> 13:16.791
THE CONTAINER IS PLACED
ON THESE CHROME ROLLERS.

13:16.800 --> 13:19.223
THEN A SMALL DOOR RAISES
AND THE BODY GOES THROUGH.

13:19.230 --> 13:21.118
LIKE HOW YOUR
TRAY DISAPPEARS

13:21.130 --> 13:22.791
THROUGH THAT THING
IN THE CAFETERIA ?

13:22.800 --> 13:24.097
UH, YEAH.

13:24.100 --> 13:26.853
ACTUALLY,
IT'S JUST LIKE THAT.

13:26.860 --> 13:28.919
AND THEN ?

13:28.930 --> 13:34.152
AND THEN ONCE
THE BODY IS IN THERE,

13:34.160 --> 13:36.549
THEN THERE'S A BUTTON
THAT'S PRESSED.

13:36.560 --> 13:37.788
SOUNDS GOOD.

13:37.800 --> 13:39.256
EVEN THOUGH THE GOOD RABBI
SAID I SHOULDN'T,

13:39.260 --> 13:40.852
JUST BURN ME UP.

13:40.860 --> 13:42.896
WHO PUSHES THE BUTTON ?

13:42.900 --> 13:44.595
WHOMEVER YOU SPECIFY.

13:44.600 --> 13:46.898
BUDDHISTS HAVE
A FAMILY MEMBER.

13:46.900 --> 13:48.754
AND THEN SOME PEOPLE
CHOOSE NO ONE,

13:48.760 --> 13:50.853
IN WHICH CASE THE PERSON WHO
WORKS AT THE CREMATORY DOES IT.

13:50.860 --> 13:52.498
I'LL TAKE THAT GUY.

13:53.860 --> 13:57.159
I GUESS I'LL BE ON MY OWN
AT THAT POINT, THOUGH.

13:57.160 --> 14:01.358
WHAT ABOUT FAMILY MEMBERS,
YOUR PARENTS ?

14:01.360 --> 14:04.659
THEY JUST GOT TO BE
TOTAL DOWNERS.

14:04.660 --> 14:06.196
I TOLD THEM
TO STOP COMING.

14:06.200 --> 14:08.293
THEY'LL FIND OUT I'M DEAD
WHEN THE REST OF THE WORLD DOES.

14:08.300 --> 14:11.098
ANY OTHER FRIENDS ?

14:11.100 --> 14:14.649
YEAH, I HAD SOME,
A LOT OF WORK, YOU KNOW ?

14:14.660 --> 14:17.151
A LOT OF PEOPLE FREAK OUT
WHEN YOU GET SICK,

14:17.160 --> 14:19.458
AND A BUNCH OF PEOPLE
BETRAYED ME,

14:19.460 --> 14:22.497
SOME PEOPLE JUST GOT
TOO CRAZY TO DEAL WITH.

14:22.500 --> 14:24.229
WHAT ABOUT
A GIRLFRIEND ?

14:24.230 --> 14:26.095
NAH, I MEAN, YEAH,
I HAD GIRLFRIENDS.

14:26.100 --> 14:27.920
RELATIONSHIPS.

14:27.930 --> 14:30.398
I'D BE IN SOMETHING,
FOR WHATEVER,

14:30.400 --> 14:32.857
LIKE TWO MONTHS,
TWO YEARS,

14:32.860 --> 14:35.920
THEN IT WOULD
JUST GET TOO...

14:35.930 --> 14:39.696
TOO NOTHING,

14:39.700 --> 14:41.725
JUST TOO.

14:41.730 --> 14:43.925
I'D START THINKING,
I DON'T LIKE THIS ABOUT HER,

14:43.930 --> 14:45.397
AND I DON'T LIKE
THIS ABOUT HER.

14:45.400 --> 14:47.960
THEN I WOULD START
TO FEEL THIS THING
ON THE BACK OF MY NECK,

14:47.960 --> 14:50.053
JUST LIKE ONE OF
THOSE SUPERBALLS,

14:50.060 --> 14:52.096
AND IT WOULD JUST THROB
WITH THE WORD, "LEAVE".

14:52.100 --> 14:54.159
"LEAVE, LEAVE,"

14:54.160 --> 14:56.048
AND SO I WOULD.

14:56.060 --> 14:57.391
AND THE SECOND
I GOT MY LIFE BACK,

14:57.400 --> 15:00.654
THE BALL WOULD DISAPPEAR.

15:02.400 --> 15:04.755
I SUFFER FROM THAT
AMERICAN THING, BIG TIME.

15:04.760 --> 15:07.024
ALWAYS LOOKING AROUND
FOR SOMEONE BETTER.

15:07.030 --> 15:09.055
SHOPPING.

15:09.060 --> 15:11.528
I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE
GO THROUGH THAT.

15:11.530 --> 15:12.997
NO, THEY DON'T, MAN.

15:13.000 --> 15:14.752
OKAY ?
THEY DON'T.

15:14.760 --> 15:16.853
MOST PEOPLE
JUST PICK SOMEONE.

15:16.860 --> 15:20.557
I NEVER LOOKED AT SOMEONE
AND JUST SAID, "OKAY...

15:20.560 --> 15:22.790
I'LL TAKE YOU."

15:25.060 --> 15:28.996
YOU CAN STILL
CONNECT WITH PEOPLE.

15:30.700 --> 15:33.089
NO, I CAN'T.

15:33.100 --> 15:36.319
IT'S TOO LATE.

15:38.300 --> 15:39.995
LISTEN...

15:40.000 --> 15:43.356
I'M GONNA MAKE
A COMMITMENT TO YOU.

15:43.360 --> 15:46.454
I AM HEREBY COMMITTING
TO COME AND SEE YOU

15:46.460 --> 15:48.928
EVERY DAY,
WITHOUT FAIL.

15:48.930 --> 15:52.149
YOU DON'T HAVE TO COME
AND SEE ME EVERY DAY.

15:52.160 --> 15:54.094
NO, I WANT TO.

15:54.100 --> 15:56.352
WHATEVER.

15:56.360 --> 15:58.897
ALRIGHT,
UNTIL TOMORROW THEN.

16:00.300 --> 16:03.349
YOU WANT ME TO BRING YOU
ANYTHING, MAGAZINES ?

16:03.360 --> 16:04.918
NAH.

16:18.360 --> 16:20.351
MAY I HELP YOU ?

16:20.360 --> 16:21.793
ARE YOU THE OWNER ?

16:21.800 --> 16:23.222
YES, I'M DAVID FISHER.

16:23.230 --> 16:24.458
ANDREW PEREZ.

16:24.460 --> 16:26.325
I UNDERSTAND MY MOTHER'S FUNERAL
IS TO BE HELD HERE.

16:26.330 --> 16:28.127
YES, OF COURSE,
I'M SO SORRY FOR YOUR LOSS.

16:28.130 --> 16:29.495
THANK YOU.

16:29.500 --> 16:31.456
I WAS WONDERING IF WE COULD
GO OVER THE ARRANGEMENTS.

16:31.460 --> 16:33.018
OF COURSE, LET ME JUST
GET MY ASSOCIATE,

16:33.030 --> 16:35.294
HE HELPED YOUR MOTHER
WITH HER PRE-NEED CONTRACT.

16:35.300 --> 16:36.449
FINE.

16:38.200 --> 16:40.156
I WAS A PERSONAL FRIEND
OF YOUR MOTHER'S.

16:40.160 --> 16:43.288
MY FAMILY AND I LIVED
ACROSS THE STREET FROM HER
FOR MANY MANY YEARS.

16:43.300 --> 16:46.258
( phone )
I'M SORRY.

16:47.560 --> 16:48.549
HELLO.

16:48.560 --> 16:49.322
HEY.

16:49.330 --> 16:50.991
YEAH.

16:51.000 --> 16:54.049
YEAH, I JUST WANTED
TO ASK YOU,

16:54.060 --> 16:57.427
I'M, SAY ABOUT 55-MINUTE DRIVE
FROM MISSION VIEJO.

16:57.430 --> 17:00.957
WHERE'S THAT COURSE YOU
AND JIM PLAYED LAST WINTER ?

17:01.660 --> 17:03.423
HOLD ON.

17:03.430 --> 17:04.658
YOU GOT A PEN ?

17:07.000 --> 17:09.958
OKAY, OKAY.

17:09.960 --> 17:12.155
YEAH, GOT IT.

17:12.160 --> 17:15.721
YEAH, THANK YOU
SO MUCH.

17:15.730 --> 17:17.595
WELL, IT WAS HER TIME,
SHE LIVED A FULL LIFE.

17:17.600 --> 17:19.420
OKAY, YOU TAKE CARE.

17:21.000 --> 17:23.252
I'M AN ORTHOPEDIC
SURGEON

17:23.260 --> 17:25.353
AND EVERY MAY
WE DO A TOURNAMENT.

17:25.360 --> 17:27.248
YOUR MOTHER WAS VERY,
VERY PROUD OF YOU.

17:27.260 --> 17:31.151
SHE ALWAYS SAID,
"MY ANDRESITO'S A SURGEON."

17:31.160 --> 17:32.718
SHE WAS
A WONDERFUL WOMAN.

17:32.730 --> 17:36.621
AND I'D LIKE TO GIVE HER
A TOP-OF-THE-LINE FUNERAL.

17:37.700 --> 17:39.452
I LIKE THIS ONE.

17:39.460 --> 17:41.348
IS IT REAL MAHOGANY ?

17:41.360 --> 17:42.497
YES, IT IS.

17:42.500 --> 17:44.422
OH, YOUR MOTHER ALREADY
CHOSE A CASKET, SIR,

17:44.430 --> 17:45.692
IT'S IN HER PRE-NEED.

17:45.700 --> 17:47.156
SHE LIKED THIS ONE.

17:47.160 --> 17:49.424
WELL...

17:49.430 --> 17:52.399
I'D LIKE TO GIVE HER
SOMETHING NICER.

17:52.400 --> 17:54.652
YES, WELL,
SHE LIKED THIS ONE.

17:54.660 --> 17:57.197
THIS LOOKS LIKE
SOME KIND OF

17:57.200 --> 17:59.088
GANG-BANGER, LOW-RIDER,
I DON'T KNOW WHAT.

17:59.100 --> 18:01.056
SHE CHOSE THIS ONE

18:01.060 --> 18:02.698
BECAUSE SHE WAS LIVING
ON A FIXED INCOME.

18:02.700 --> 18:04.258
I HAVE MONEY
AND I WANT TO CHANGE IT.

18:04.260 --> 18:05.955
SHE LIKED THIS ONE,

18:05.960 --> 18:08.053
AND THIS IS THE ONE
THAT SHE SHOULD HAVE.

18:10.200 --> 18:12.623
MR. FISHER.

18:12.630 --> 18:14.996
I'M OFFERING
YOUR BUSINESS MORE MONEY.

18:15.000 --> 18:17.491
NOW, YOUR ASSOCIATE
SEEMS TO HAVE SOME KIND OF

18:17.500 --> 18:19.525
CONFLICT OF INTEREST
THAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

18:19.530 --> 18:21.657
I ONLY WANT TO GIVE
MY MOTHER THE BEST.

18:21.660 --> 18:25.357
I APPRECIATE YOUR CONCERN,
MR. PEREZ,

18:25.360 --> 18:28.523
AND I'D BE HAPPY TO UPGRADE
YOUR MOTHER'S CASKET.

18:28.530 --> 18:34.218
BUT LEGALLY, WE'RE REQUIRED
TO FULFILL HER WISHES.

18:36.700 --> 18:41.057
I DON'T KNOW WHAT KIND OF
PIECE OF SHIT OPERATION

18:41.060 --> 18:42.891
YOU PEOPLE ARE RUNNING HERE,
I REALLY DON'T.

18:42.900 --> 18:45.528
I'M TRYING TO DO
SOMETHING NICE FOR MY MOTHER

18:45.530 --> 18:49.091
AND YOU JUST WON'T
GET OUT OF MY FUCKING WAY.

18:54.030 --> 18:55.622
( door slamming )

18:55.900 --> 18:59.290
WELL, I'M GOING
TO GO MAKE A SALAD.

19:00.430 --> 19:02.648
DAVID ?

19:03.930 --> 19:07.297
IF YOU WEREN'T
LEGALLY BOUND TO FOLLOW
MRS. PEREZ'S INSTRUCTIONS,

19:07.300 --> 19:08.756
WOULD YOU HAVE--

19:08.760 --> 19:10.227
TO BE PERFECT LY HONEST,

19:10.230 --> 19:12.790
I'M NOT ENTIRELY SURE
WE ARE LEGALLY BOUND.

19:20.100 --> 19:23.058
ALRIGHT, THAT SHOULD
BE EVERYTHING.

19:24.760 --> 19:27.422
NOW, I WILL CONTACT YOU
AS SOON AS I KNOW

19:27.430 --> 19:30.251
IF WE'LL BE ABLE
TO DO A VIEWING, OKAY ?

19:30.260 --> 19:33.229
NO ONE SHOULD HAVE TO
SEE HIM THIS WAY,
NOT EVEN MY MOTHER.

19:33.230 --> 19:35.528
MY SON IS THE ONE WHO SAW
EVERYTHING HAPPEN.

19:35.530 --> 19:37.293
IT WAS RAINING.

19:37.300 --> 19:40.849
AND I HAD TOLD MY DAD THAT
IT WAS TOO SLIPPERY ON THE ROOF.

19:40.860 --> 19:42.020
OF THE HOUSE.

19:42.030 --> 19:44.191
MY HUSBAND WAS FIXING
THE ROOF HIMSELF.

19:44.200 --> 19:45.997
BUT HE WENT
UP THERE ANYWAY.

19:46.000 --> 19:48.298
YOU'RE GONNA FREAK
WHEN YOU SEE HIM.

19:48.300 --> 19:49.597
I SAW HIM.

19:49.600 --> 19:51.352
I'LL BE OKAY.

19:51.360 --> 19:56.150
I TURNED HIM OVER
AND I LOOKED AT HIM.

19:56.160 --> 19:59.823
I KNOW YOU'RE NOT
SUPPOSED TO TOUCH 'EM,

19:59.830 --> 20:02.048
BECAUSE IT MIGHT BE
A BACK INJURY AND ALL,

20:02.060 --> 20:05.552
AND MY MOTHER STARTED
YELLING NOT TO TOUCH HIM--

20:05.560 --> 20:07.653
I THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE
A BACK INJURY.

20:07.660 --> 20:09.457
BUT I TURNED HIM OVER.

20:09.460 --> 20:13.021
YOU SEE, HE FELL
LIKE, FACE FIRST

20:13.030 --> 20:16.124
INTO THE PILE OF BRICKS
ON THE SIDE OF THE HOUSE, SO...

20:18.600 --> 20:21.023
I SAW HIM,
I...

20:21.030 --> 20:22.998
( sobbing )

20:23.000 --> 20:26.925
( mother)
IT'S OKAY, MIJO,
IT'S OKAY.

20:40.130 --> 20:42.018
WHAT ARE YOU
LOOKING FOR ?

20:42.030 --> 20:43.895
ANYTHING THAT
SEEMS TOO FUNNY.

20:43.900 --> 20:46.755
FUNNY "HA-HA"
OR FUNNY GAY ?

20:46.760 --> 20:49.797
WHAT ABOUT THIS,
THINK I SHOULD PUT THIS AWAY ?

20:49.800 --> 20:51.358
WHAT IS IT ?

20:51.360 --> 20:52.952
ESQUIRE'S "THINGS A MAN
SHOULD KNOW ABOUT STYLE".

20:52.960 --> 20:54.928
OH, PLEASE, A BOOK ABOUT
FASHION HAS TO BE GAY ?

20:54.930 --> 20:56.795
STOP BEING
SUCH A BIGOT.

20:56.800 --> 21:01.225
"SPY KIDS", "SHADOW",
"SHADOW TWO", UH-OH.

21:01.230 --> 21:05.394
HERE, TAYLOR,
PUT THIS AWAY.

21:05.400 --> 21:07.152
"THE WIZ" ?
YOU'RE KIDDING.

21:07.160 --> 21:08.297
IT'S A GAY VIDEO.

21:08.300 --> 21:09.358
IT'S A KID'S VIDEO.

21:09.360 --> 21:11.089
WITH DIANA ROSS
AND MICHAEL JACKSON ?

21:11.100 --> 21:12.954
MICHAEL JACKSON'S
A SCARECROW.

21:12.960 --> 21:15.121
IT'S NOT LIKE THEY'RE NOT
GOING TO KNOW THAT WE'RE GAY.

21:15.130 --> 21:16.597
WE'RE TWO MEN
LIVING TOGETHER.

21:16.600 --> 21:18.420
YEAH, WELL, I DON'T
WANT TO SEEM TOO GAY.

21:18.430 --> 21:20.159
OR LIKE WE'RE TRYING
TO MAKE HER GAY.

21:20.160 --> 21:22.048
OH, RIGHT, WATCHING "THE WIZ"
WILL TURN HER INTO A LESBIAN.

21:22.060 --> 21:24.551
DAVID,
DON'T BE SO NAIVE.

21:24.560 --> 21:26.255
THAT'S THE WAY SOME
OF THESE PEOPLE THINK.

21:26.260 --> 21:27.522
YOU OUGHT
TO WORRY ABOUT IT

21:27.530 --> 21:28.952
MAKING HER WANT
TO HAVE PLASTIC SURGERY.

21:28.960 --> 21:31.349
Y'ALL ARE CRAZY.

21:31.900 --> 21:34.095
OKAY, NOW,
WHAT ABOUT THIS ?

21:34.100 --> 21:36.489
OKAY, THAT'S PRETTY GAY.

21:38.500 --> 21:40.297
HEY.

21:40.300 --> 21:43.121
SO, THANK YOU FOR
HOOKING ME UP WITH LAC-ARTS.

21:43.130 --> 21:44.927
I FINALLY WENT
AND VISITED.

21:44.930 --> 21:46.227
UH-HUH.

21:46.230 --> 21:49.495
AN D, ACTUALLY, IT WAS AMAZING,
NOT JUST THE FACILITIES,

21:49.500 --> 21:51.525
I MEAN,
WHICH WERE UNBELIEVABLE,

21:51.530 --> 21:53.395
THEY HAD THIS WHOLE
GIANT KILN WING--

21:53.400 --> 21:54.799
A WHAT WING ?

21:54.800 --> 21:55.949
KILN.

21:55.960 --> 21:57.154
UH-HUH.

21:57.160 --> 22:00.129
BUT, THERE WERE THESE,
I DON'T KNOW, NOT COOL PEOPLE,

22:00.130 --> 22:02.451
'CAUSE THEY'RE NOT LIKE THE,
WHATEVER, POSEURS HERE,

22:02.460 --> 22:03.757
BUT THE PEOPLE THERE--

22:03.760 --> 22:05.227
HOW LARGE IS
THE STUDENT BODY ?

22:05.230 --> 22:09.553
UM, I DON'T KNOW,
BUT I JUST--

22:09.560 --> 22:11.619
I DID MY WHOLE
APPLICATION THING,

22:11.630 --> 22:15.623
AND I JUST...

22:15.630 --> 22:17.791
I JUST--

22:17.800 --> 22:19.324

22:19.330 --> 22:21.753
I WANT THIS.

22:21.760 --> 22:25.423
I REALLY
WANT TO GO THERE.

22:25.430 --> 22:29.651
WELL, JUST LET ME KNOW

22:29.660 --> 22:31.799
IF THERE'S ANYTHING
I CAN DO TO HELP.

22:31.800 --> 22:35.725
WELL, ACTUALLY, I DO NEED TO GET
THREE LETTERS OF RECOMMENDATION.

22:35.730 --> 22:38.221
I'LL BE HAPPY
TO WRITE YOU ONE.

22:38.230 --> 22:40.095
IT JUST MAY TAKE ME
A COUPLE DAYS.

22:40.100 --> 22:41.727
UH, NO, I MEAN,

22:41.730 --> 22:43.789
THEY HAVE TO BE FROM LIKE
SUCCESSFUL ARTISTS,

22:43.800 --> 22:46.325
SO, I WAS WONDERING
IF MAYBE YOU KNEW ANYBODY--

22:46.330 --> 22:47.729
NO.

22:47.730 --> 22:51.325
NO, I DON'T KNOW
THOSE KIND OF PEOPLE.

22:55.760 --> 22:58.593
IS IT YOUR BIRTHDAY
OR SOMETHING ?

22:58.600 --> 23:00.989
JUST GOING AWAY GIFTS
FROM SOME OF THE KIDS

23:01.000 --> 23:03.389
THAT I'VE WORKED WITH
OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS.

23:03.400 --> 23:06.358
WHERE ARE YOU GOING ?

23:06.360 --> 23:09.056
CUTBACKS, JUST ONE COUNSELOR'S
GOING TO SERVE THE DISTRICT.

23:09.060 --> 23:11.153
NOT ME.

23:11.160 --> 23:13.549
SOME OTHER GUY WHO'S BEEN
IN THE SYSTEM LONGER.

23:13.560 --> 23:16.825
I CAN'T BELIEVE THEY--

23:16.830 --> 23:18.195
GOT RID OF ME ?

23:18.200 --> 23:20.623
YEAH.

23:20.630 --> 23:24.657
I THINK IT WAS TIME
TO MOVE ON ANYWAY.

23:27.200 --> 23:29.896
WELL...

23:29.900 --> 23:33.620
I'M SURE WE'LL FIND EACH OTHER
AT GRADUATION, RIGHT ?

23:33.630 --> 23:36.827
( phone ringing )

23:36.830 --> 23:38.422
YEAH.

23:38.430 --> 23:43.527
OH, NO, OF COURSE,
THANKS FOR GETTING BACK TO ME.

23:44.930 --> 23:46.989
YEAH, I DO, OKAY.

23:48.730 --> 23:51.255
NO.

23:51.260 --> 23:54.024
NO, SORRY, I DON'T KNOW
WHERE THAT IS.

23:55.330 --> 23:59.494
HOW DO I GET THERE ?

24:00.400 --> 24:02.027
OKAY.

24:02.030 --> 24:04.897
"LAST THING AT NIGHT
BEFORE I FALL ASLEEP, LOVE.

24:04.900 --> 24:08.859
"FIRST THING
AFTER SUNRISE, LOVE.

24:08.860 --> 24:12.489
"I WAS BORN
SEARCHING FOR YOU

24:12.500 --> 24:16.197
"AND WHEN I GO INTO THE DARKNESS
OF MY FINAL GOODBYE,

24:16.200 --> 24:19.897
IT WILL BE
WITH YOU, LOVE."

24:19.900 --> 24:22.892
WELL, WHAT
DO YOU THINK ?

24:22.900 --> 24:27.826
SHOULDN'T YOU AND DAD
BE WRITING YOUR VOWS TOGETHER ?

24:27.830 --> 24:30.196
NO, WE'RE GOING TO
SURPRISE EACH OTHER.

24:30.200 --> 24:34.296
HE'S AT ESALEN
DOING SOME RITUALS
TO CLEANSE HIS BOY ENERGY,

24:34.300 --> 24:37.394
AND I JUST KNOW
HE'S GONNA BE NAUGHTY

24:37.400 --> 24:40.051
AND GET RAM DASS
TO HELP HIM WRITE HIS SPEECH.

24:40.060 --> 24:41.459
I STILL
DON'T UNDERSTAND

24:41.460 --> 24:43.291
WHY YOU HAVE TO HAVE ANOTHER
COMMITMENT CEREMONY.

24:43.300 --> 24:45.052
CAN'T YOU JUST
GO TO HAWAII ?

24:45.060 --> 24:46.755
LEAVE THE REST OF US
OUT OF IT ?

24:46.760 --> 24:49.194
IT'S ABOUT UNDERSTANDING THAT
WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO,

24:49.200 --> 24:50.952
BUT WE NEED
TO DO IT TOGETHER.

24:50.960 --> 24:53.622
HONEY, DO YOU KNOW
WHAT A "SOUL TWIN" IS ?

24:53.630 --> 24:55.495
SOULMATES
AREN'T ENOUGH ?

24:55.500 --> 24:57.525
I HAVE TO HAVE
A "SOUL TWIN" NOW ?

24:57.530 --> 24:59.953
OH, GREAT,
MORE FUCKING PROPAGANDA.

24:59.960 --> 25:05.626
BRENDA, "SOUL TWIN" ONLY MEANS
THAT YOUR FATHER AND I

25:05.630 --> 25:08.849
MADE AN AGREEMENT
IN ANOTHER WORLD TO MEET AGAIN

25:08.860 --> 25:11.522
IN THIS WORLD
AND WALK THROUGH IT TOGETHER.

25:11.530 --> 25:15.159
AND SO NOW, WE HAVE TO STOP
WALKING ALONGSIDE ONE ANOTHER,

25:15.160 --> 25:18.095
AND TURN
AND FACE EACH OTHER,

25:18.100 --> 25:20.591
AND MOVE THROUGH THE WORLD
FACE TO FACE.

25:20.600 --> 25:22.352
( Brenda )
HOW WILL YOU SEE
WHERE YOU'RE GOING ?

25:22.360 --> 25:26.922
YOU KNOW, ALL THIS SARCASM
ONLY IMPEDES YOUR PRANA.

25:26.930 --> 25:29.057
WHAT'S WITH ALL
THE NEW AGE SHIT ?

25:29.060 --> 25:30.698
YOU AND DAD
DROPPING ACID AGAIN ?

25:30.700 --> 25:32.554
NOT AT ALL, DARLING.

25:32.560 --> 25:35.324
SOMETHING WONDERFUL
HAS HAPPENED.

25:35.330 --> 25:37.924
AFTER A LIFETIME
OF BEING BLOCKED,

25:37.930 --> 25:41.093
I'VE FINALLY DISCOVERED
MY SPIRITUALITY.

25:41.100 --> 25:42.556
GREAT.

25:42.560 --> 25:44.357
SOMEBODY WHO'S COMPLETELY
NOT IN TOUCH WITH HERSELF,

25:44.360 --> 25:46.089
NOW HAS A
WHOLE NEW VOCABULARY

25:46.100 --> 25:48.125
TO NOT TO BE IN TOUCH
WITH HERSELF WITH.

25:48.130 --> 25:51.850
I DON'T KNOW WHY
YOU HAVE TO BE SO CYNICAL.

25:51.860 --> 25:54.454
IT'S JUST FEAR.

25:55.560 --> 25:58.757
HEY, YOU AND NATE HAVE
THAT THING, DON'T YOU ?

25:58.760 --> 26:02.150
I CALL IT THE MAGNET.

26:02.160 --> 26:05.049
WELL ?

26:06.900 --> 26:08.754
BABY ?

26:08.760 --> 26:13.891
BRENDA, I WANT TO GIVE YOU
A LITTLE PIECE OF ADVICE.

26:13.900 --> 26:19.020
IF YOU DON'T HAVE
THAT FEELING, GET OUT...

26:19.030 --> 26:19.792
NOW.

26:19.800 --> 26:20.994
OF COURSE
WE HAVE THAT.

26:21.000 --> 26:22.752
WHAT, YOU THINK YOU'RE
THE ONLY ONES TO HAVE THAT ?

26:22.760 --> 26:24.296
GOD, THE EGO !

26:26.400 --> 26:29.358
$149,000.

26:34.700 --> 26:36.691
A WHAT ?
A HUNDRED WHAT ?

26:36.700 --> 26:38.691
$149,000.

26:38.700 --> 26:40.691
AND SHE
LEFT IT TO US ?

26:40.700 --> 26:42.258
YES, SHE DID.

26:42.260 --> 26:44.626
WHICH I'M GATHERING IS SOMEWHAT
OF A SURPRISE TO YOU ?

26:44.630 --> 26:47.793
UH, YEAH,
SOMEWHAT.

26:47.800 --> 26:49.153
I LOVE WHEN
THIS HAPPENS.

26:49.160 --> 26:50.752
IT'S THE FUN PART
OF BEING A TRUST ATTORNEY.

26:50.760 --> 26:52.955
I JUST HAVE A COUPLE
OF FORMS FOR YOU TO SIGN,

26:52.960 --> 26:54.825
BEFORE YOU CAN COLLECT
YOUR INHERITANCE.

26:54.830 --> 26:57.048
I'LL BE
JUST A MOMENT.

26:58.600 --> 26:59.794
OH, MY GOD.

26:59.800 --> 27:00.619
OH, MY GOD.

27:00.630 --> 27:03.952
$149,000, BABE ?

27:03.960 --> 27:07.054
THAT'S LIKE $150,000.

27:07.060 --> 27:09.722
ALL I DID WAS
CLEAN HER GUTTERS SOMETIMES.

27:09.730 --> 27:12.858
ALL I DID WAS GIVE YOU SOME
PASTELES TO BRING TO HER.

27:12.860 --> 27:15.192
WHY WOULD SHE LEAVE
ALL THIS TO US ?

27:15.200 --> 27:16.929
I DON'T KNOW.

27:16.930 --> 27:19.091
YOU KNOW,
YOU WENT AND SAW HER.

27:19.100 --> 27:21.250
SHE PROBABLY COUNTED ON YOU
MORE THAN YOU EVEN THOUGHT.

27:21.260 --> 27:22.750
OH, NO, NO, NO,
YOU TOO.

27:22.760 --> 27:25.558
OKAY ? THIS MONEY
IS FOR BOTH OF US.

27:25.560 --> 27:27.289
BABY, YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO MADE HER THE PASTELES.

27:27.300 --> 27:29.928
IF I WOULD'VE KNOWN
SHE WAS GONNA LEAVE US
ALL THIS MONEY

27:29.930 --> 27:33.058
I WOULD HAVE MADE HER
SOME ALCAPURRIAS

27:33.060 --> 27:34.288
OR SOMETHING.

27:36.200 --> 27:39.988
I'M JUST THERE TO REMIND YOU
THAT I CAN'T FEEL NO PAIN

27:40.000 --> 27:43.094
WHY DON'T YOU
LET IT BE

27:44.200 --> 27:49.649
SURROUND, SISTER,
TAKE CARE OF ME

27:51.100 --> 27:54.752
SURROUND SISTER

27:54.760 --> 27:58.753
'CAUSE I'M NOT
AFRAID TO FALL

27:58.760 --> 28:02.753
NO, I'M NOT
AFRAID TO FALL

28:02.760 --> 28:08.323
I'M NOT AFRAID
AT ALL

28:13.060 --> 28:14.527
I READ ABOUT
A BIKE TRIP

28:14.530 --> 28:16.225
WHERE YOU TOUR
THE COUNTRYSIDE OF VIETNAM.

28:16.230 --> 28:17.822
IT'S IN 2003.

28:17.830 --> 28:21.652
HOW IN 2003 YOU KNOW
WHERE WE'RE GOING TO BE ?

28:21.660 --> 28:23.321
HOW YOU KNOW THIS ?

28:23.330 --> 28:24.399
THAT'S RIGHT.

28:24.400 --> 28:25.719
WE VERY WELL
MIGHT BE DEAD.

28:25.730 --> 28:28.619
WE'RE ALL GOING TO DIE
SOONER THAN WE'D LIKE,

28:28.630 --> 28:30.848
AND MAYBE WE SHOULD TRY TO DO
SOME NICE THINGS BEFORE WE DIE,

28:30.860 --> 28:32.555
LIKE BICYCLE
THROUGH VIETNAM.

28:32.560 --> 28:34.118
WE COULD SAVE UP
FOR IT.

28:34.130 --> 28:35.791
IT WOULD GIVE US SOMETHING
TO LOOK FORWARD TO.

28:35.800 --> 28:39.349
( speaking Russian )

28:42.230 --> 28:45.154
( laughing )

28:51.630 --> 28:53.393
TWO FOR
"MURDER BY NUMBERS."

28:53.400 --> 28:54.651
NO, I DON'T LIKE IT.

28:54.660 --> 28:57.026
IS SANDRA BULLOCK,
IS A GIRLS' MOVIE.

28:57.030 --> 28:58.054
OH.

28:58.060 --> 28:59.152
I THOUGHT WE AGREED--

28:59.160 --> 29:00.320
I SEE "BLADE TWO."

29:00.330 --> 29:01.957
YOU GO AHEAD
AND SEE THE GIRLS' MOVIE.

29:01.960 --> 29:03.552
WHY DID WE EVEN
COME TOGETHER IF--

29:03.560 --> 29:06.552
WE GO TO TWO DIFFERENT MOVIES,
WE GET TOGETHER LATER TO EAT.

29:06.560 --> 29:08.858
ONE FOR "BLADE TWO"

29:08.860 --> 29:11.624
AND ONE FOR
"MURDERING BY THE NUMBERS."

29:11.630 --> 29:13.222
ALRIGHT,
HERE'S YOUR TICKET.

29:13.230 --> 29:14.197
THANK YOU.

29:14.200 --> 29:15.952
NEXT IN LINE.

29:15.960 --> 29:17.825
I'LL MEET YOU
RIGHT HERE AT 7:40.

29:17.830 --> 29:19.650
THEN WE'LL HAVE
A NICE SUPPER.

29:19.660 --> 29:21.298
OKAY.

29:30.930 --> 29:34.058
IN YOUR EYES,
I SEE MYSELF.

29:34.060 --> 29:36.358
MY COPIOUS IMPERFECTIONS,

29:36.360 --> 29:40.694
AS WELL AS THE TATTERED SHREDS
OF MY DIVINITY.

29:40.700 --> 29:45.148
ALL THE JOY I'VE BROUGHT YOU
AND THE PAIN I'VE CAUSED.

29:45.160 --> 29:48.789
AND STILL YOU
HOLD ME IN YOUR GAZE,

29:48.800 --> 29:51.394
UNDAUNTED BY WHAT
LOVE DEMANDS OF US.

29:51.400 --> 29:56.622
YOU GIVE ME STRENGTH
TO SEE YOU, ONLY YOU,

29:56.630 --> 30:01.055
NOW AND FOREVER,
I'M BLESSED.

30:01.060 --> 30:05.895
AND SO, IN THE NAME
OF THE FOUR ELEMENTS,

30:05.900 --> 30:08.619
AND OF THE GOD LINGAM
AND THE GODDESS YANNI,

30:08.630 --> 30:12.293
I NOW PRONOUNCE YOU,
MARGARET AND BERN CHENOWITH,

30:12.300 --> 30:14.825
NEWLY WED.

30:31.800 --> 30:34.360
SO, TAYLOR,
WHAT'S YOUR FAVORITE PART
ABOUT FOURTH GRADE ?

30:34.360 --> 30:37.124
MATH IS FUN.

30:37.130 --> 30:39.598
REALLY ?

30:40.760 --> 30:43.228
AND RECESS.

30:45.700 --> 30:47.656
SHE'S GOOD AT
SO MUCH.

30:47.660 --> 30:50.527
YEAH, SHE SURE IS.

30:51.960 --> 30:54.952
SO, WOULD YOU SAY YOU TWO
HAVE A PARENTING STYLE ?

30:54.960 --> 30:59.522
WELL, WE'VE BEEN READING A LOT
ABOUT THE WHOLE CHILD THEORY.

30:59.530 --> 31:00.895
MM-HMM.

31:00.900 --> 31:04.927
ALTHOUGH WE DEFINITELY LIKE
TO MIX IN A LITTLE COMMON SENSE.

31:04.930 --> 31:06.750
HOW SO ?

31:06.760 --> 31:09.558
WELL, WE CERTAINLY BELIEVE
IN SETTING LIMITS,

31:09.560 --> 31:13.098
BUT WE TRY NOT
TO BE TOO RIGID.

31:18.900 --> 31:22.028
WELL, I THINK THAT SHOULD
JUST ABOUT DO IT.

31:22.030 --> 31:25.818
THANK YOU FOR COMING,
MR. SHERMAN, SIR.

31:25.830 --> 31:28.958
I'LL NEED TO HAVE A CONVERSATION
WITH YOUR SUPERVISORS,

31:28.960 --> 31:31.190
ABOUT YOUR WORK
AND SO FORTH.

31:31.200 --> 31:32.599
WELL, I'M MY
OWN SUPERVISOR.

31:32.600 --> 31:34.249
I'M A BUSINESS OWNER.

31:34.260 --> 31:35.659
OKAY.

31:35.660 --> 31:37.799
AND, AS MY SUPERVISOR,

31:37.800 --> 31:40.121
I'D LIKE TO SAY THAT
DAVID FISHER IS A GREAT PERSON,

31:40.130 --> 31:41.927
AND GREAT
TO WORK WITH.

31:43.560 --> 31:47.121
MY SUPERVISOR IS SERGEANT POTTS,
NORTHEAST DIVISION.

31:47.130 --> 31:49.155
I'LL PHONE HIM
TOMORROW.

31:51.030 --> 31:53.521
I'LL LET MYSELF OUT.

31:55.360 --> 31:58.329
OH, WHERE'D YOU GET
YOUR COFFEE TABLE ?

31:58.330 --> 32:00.093
RESTORATION HARDWARE.

32:00.100 --> 32:02.159
GOD, DON'T YOU JUST
LOVE THAT STORE ?

32:02.160 --> 32:03.889
I SWEAR,
I COULD LIVE THERE.

32:03.900 --> 32:06.528
OKAY, BYE.

32:11.930 --> 32:14.421
OKAY, THAT MAN
WAS TOTALLY GAY.

32:17.160 --> 32:19.253
( male #1 )
It's an interesting theory.

32:19.260 --> 32:22.525
I can't admit
to something I didn't do.

32:22.530 --> 32:24.088
( male #2 )
Looks like you
won't have to.

32:24.100 --> 32:26.898
'Cause Justin's
talking in there.

32:26.900 --> 32:29.118
Justin's here ?

32:29.130 --> 32:30.688
Mm-hmm.

32:35.530 --> 32:36.895
NIKOLAI ?

32:36.900 --> 32:37.821
( punches landing )

32:37.830 --> 32:40.651
I'M SORRY,
PLEASE EXCUSE ME.

32:42.000 --> 32:44.252
NIKOLAI, YOU DON'T REALLY
LOVE ME, I KNOW THAT.

32:44.260 --> 32:46.023
THE ONLY REASON
YOU'RE STAYING WITH ME

32:46.030 --> 32:47.657
IS BECAUSE
YOU FEEL OBLIGATED TO.

32:47.660 --> 32:49.321
AND THAT'S NOT FAIR
TO EITHER ONE OF US.

32:49.330 --> 32:52.493
SO, I AM BREAKING UP WITH YOU,
RIGHT NOW, OKAY ?

32:54.430 --> 32:56.591
WELL, OKAY.

32:59.900 --> 33:02.892
( swords clanking )

33:07.900 --> 33:10.095
I'M SO SORRY,
PLEASE EXCUSE ME.

33:10.100 --> 33:11.852
( female )
CHRIST, LADY.

33:24.200 --> 33:26.521
( male #1 )
Which Lisa ?

33:29.300 --> 33:32.349
( male #2 )
So, you really need
to tell me what happened.

33:32.360 --> 33:35.898
Just think of it
as a game.

33:35.900 --> 33:39.996
Whoever talks first
IS the wrnner.

33:43.360 --> 33:45.396
SO, YOU'RE NEXT, HUH ?

33:45.400 --> 33:47.254
YEAH.

33:47.260 --> 33:48.796
YEAH, I GUESS SO.

33:48.800 --> 33:52.759
SO, WASN'T THAT CEREMONY
UNBELIEVABLY--

33:52.760 --> 33:54.227
PITIFUL ?
PATHETIC ?

33:54.230 --> 33:56.596
OR MAYBE A WORD THAT
HASN'T BEEN INVENTED YET.

33:56.600 --> 33:58.852
VOMITROCIOUS,
IS THAT A WORD ?

33:58.860 --> 34:00.691
I WAS GONNA SAY SWEET.

34:00.700 --> 34:02.895
I THOUGHT
IT WAS SWEET.

34:02.900 --> 34:04.219
YOU'RE JOKING.

34:04.230 --> 34:05.356
I KINDA BOUGHT IT.

34:05.360 --> 34:07.123
I MEAN, LOOK AT
THE TWO OF THEM.

34:07.130 --> 34:10.099
WHO ELSE WOULD HAVE
EITHER ONE OF THEM ?

34:10.100 --> 34:11.658
WELL, YEAH.

34:11.660 --> 34:13.150
AND THEY RECOGNIZE THAT.

34:13.160 --> 34:15.958
FOR BETTER OR WORSE,
THEY ACCEPT EACH OTHER.

34:15.960 --> 34:17.848
FOR BETTER
OR FOR WORSE ?

34:17.860 --> 34:19.293
SO, BY WORSE
DO YOU MEAN

34:19.300 --> 34:20.756
ALL THE PEOPLE
THEY RANDOMLY FUCKED--

34:20.760 --> 34:21.920
STOP !

34:21.930 --> 34:24.023
PLEASE.

34:24.030 --> 34:28.626
THEY'RE OUR PARENTS, BREN.

34:29.460 --> 34:32.224
IT CAN'T BE GOOD
FOR US TO TALK ABOUT
MOM AND DAD LIKE THAT.

34:32.230 --> 34:35.449
AH, YOU'RE SAYING
I CROSSED A LINE ?

34:35.460 --> 34:37.394
IT'S THE WAY WE'VE ALWAYS BEEN,
IT'S OUR FAMILY ETHOS,

34:37.400 --> 34:39.129
SO, I UNDERSTAND
WHY YOU GO THERE.

34:39.130 --> 34:41.121
BUT I DON'T WANT TO
TALK THAT WAY ANYMORE.

34:41.130 --> 34:43.655
I DON'T THINK WE HAVE TO
PERPETUATE THE NEGATIVITY.

34:43.660 --> 34:46.049
GOD, WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOU ?

34:49.830 --> 34:52.128
CAN'T WE JUST
CELEBRATE ?

34:52.130 --> 34:54.348
THIS IS A CELEBRATION,
RIGHT ?

34:54.360 --> 34:56.624
YEAH, WHOOPIE.

34:59.130 --> 35:01.826
YOUR VOWS WERE REALLY,
REALLY MOVING.

35:01.830 --> 35:04.719
I HOPE MY CEREMONY WITH BRENDA
CAN BE THAT HEARTFELT.

35:04.730 --> 35:09.758
WHAT WE HAVE NOW
IS BASED ON REAL HONESTY.

35:09.760 --> 35:12.558
AND FORGIVENESS.

35:12.560 --> 35:15.597
THAT WOMAN SEES ME...

35:15.600 --> 35:18.251
ALWAYS HAS.

35:18.260 --> 35:20.854
SHE KNEW YOU WERE WITH
ANOTHER WOMAN AND SHE STILL--

35:20.860 --> 35:22.623
MANY, MANY OTHER WOMEN.

35:22.630 --> 35:24.427
PAST TENSE.

35:24.430 --> 35:25.749
WOW.

35:25.760 --> 35:28.558
AND SHE NOT ONLY
LIKE, DEALT WITH THE JEALOUSY,

35:28.560 --> 35:30.425
BUT SHE EVEN WANTED
TO DO THIS WITH YOU,

35:30.430 --> 35:32.125
RENEW YOUR VOWS.

35:32.130 --> 35:35.793
HER IDEA,
SO, I SOLD THE HOUSE,
MOVED IN.

35:35.800 --> 35:40.453
I SAY IF LIFE OFFERS YOU
A NEW BEGINNING, TAKE IT.

35:40.460 --> 35:41.893
YEAH.

35:41.900 --> 35:44.095
WOW.

35:44.100 --> 35:46.421
THANK GOD, YA KNOW ?

35:46.430 --> 35:53.097
I CAN'T BELIEVE I FELL INTO
THAT MID-LIFE CRISIS TRAP.

35:53.100 --> 35:56.649
GOD, WHAT A FOOL
A MAN'LL MAKE OF HIMSELF

35:56.660 --> 35:58.651
FOR SOME NEW PUSSY, HUH ?

35:58.660 --> 36:02.426
TO GROWING UP.

36:04.260 --> 36:06.490
SHE FORGAVE ME.

36:06.500 --> 36:09.458
THANK GOD, YA KNOW ?

36:09.460 --> 36:12.190
THANK GOD,
THANK GOD,

36:12.200 --> 36:14.259
THANK GOD.
THANK GOD.

36:23.400 --> 36:25.391
ARE WE EVEN MOVING ?

36:25.400 --> 36:28.858
YOU FORGOT
TO PUSH THE BUTTON.

36:48.160 --> 36:50.321
"THE MANNER IN WHICH
SHE OPENS HER HEART

36:50.330 --> 36:52.958
"TO A MOMENT
OF VISUAL TRUTH INSPIRES ME.

36:52.960 --> 36:55.656
"I AM SIMPLY AMAZED
AT THE DEPTH OF--

36:55.660 --> 36:58.254
( together )
CLAIRE FISHER'S
ARTISTIC CLAIRVOYANCE."

36:58.260 --> 37:01.354
"AN D, AS A LAC-ARTS ALUMNUS,
IT IS WITH GREAT PLEASURE

37:01.360 --> 37:03.590
THAT I HIGHLY RECOMMEND HER
FOR YOUR PROGRAM."

37:03.600 --> 37:06.057
THANK YOU.

37:06.060 --> 37:09.393
YOU MADE UP A LOT
OF REALLY COOL SHIT.

37:09.400 --> 37:10.924
ALL TRUE.

37:12.860 --> 37:14.851
I STILL NEED TO GET
TWO MORE LETTERS.

37:14.860 --> 37:16.725
THIS GUY WHO WORKS
IN MY TRADER JOE'S

37:16.730 --> 37:18.595
HAD ONE OF HIS COLLAGES
IN A SHOW AT MOCA.

37:18.600 --> 37:20.192
I COULD ASK HIM
TO WRITE A LETTER.

37:20.200 --> 37:21.724
COOL, THAT WOULD
BE GREAT.

37:21.730 --> 37:24.551
YOU KNOW, WHEN I WENT
TO VISIT MY AUNT SARAH

37:26.660 --> 37:28.423
YEAH.

37:28.430 --> 37:29.499
YOU'VE HEARD OF HER ?

37:29.500 --> 37:30.228
SURE, SHE'S HUGE.

37:30.230 --> 37:31.527
YEAH.
REALLY ?

37:31.530 --> 37:34.055
I THINK SHE HAD SEX
WITH MY BROTHER,

37:34.060 --> 37:35.652
WHEN HE WAS LIKE, 15.

37:35.660 --> 37:37.491
DE-VIRGINIZED HIM, EVEN.

37:37.500 --> 37:39.718
USE IT.

37:41.160 --> 37:43.299
OH, WOW.

37:43.300 --> 37:47.122
THIS ONE
IS REALLY HOT.

37:47.130 --> 37:48.654
YEAH.

37:54.860 --> 37:56.919
YOU'RE LOOKING
AT ME WEIRD.

37:56.930 --> 37:59.228
WHAT ?

37:59.230 --> 38:02.996
YOU ARE SO...

38:04.800 --> 38:08.520
THAT I JUST WANNA
REACH OVER AND...

38:10.360 --> 38:12.828
BUT THEN I ALSO
WANT TO DO NOTHING,

38:12.830 --> 38:15.549
'CAUSE I WANT TO MAKE SURE
I KNOW YOU FOR AS LONG AS

38:15.560 --> 38:17.699
I POSSIBLY CAN
WITHOUT FUCKING IT UP,

38:17.700 --> 38:20.794
WHICH IS LIKE,
MY SPECIAL SUPERPOWER.

38:20.800 --> 38:25.624
THAT'S WHY I DON'T
WANNA TOUCH YOU,

38:25.630 --> 38:28.599
AND THAT'S PRETTY MUCH VERBATIM,
MOMENT FOR MOMENT

38:28.600 --> 38:30.556
WHAT I WAS THINKING
WHEN I WAS LOOKING AT YOU

38:30.560 --> 38:31.788
WITH THE WEIRDNESS.

38:35.400 --> 38:38.153
I'M SORRY I MADE YOU
UNCOMFORTABLE.

38:41.760 --> 38:43.990
YOU'LL NEVER BE ABLE
TO SEE YOURSELF

38:44.000 --> 38:45.797
THE WAY OTHER PEOPLE
SEE YOU.

38:45.800 --> 38:48.360
THE WAY I SEE YOU.

38:48.360 --> 38:50.157
WHICH IS A SHAME.

38:50.160 --> 38:52.651
BECAUSE YOU ARE...

38:52.660 --> 38:57.222
I REALLY THINK YOU HAVE NO IDEA
HOW BEAUTIFUL YOU ARE.

39:03.330 --> 39:05.821
YOU HAVE DOUBLES
OF THIS ONE.

39:05.830 --> 39:07.718
YOU MIND
IF I SNAG IT ?

39:07.730 --> 39:11.029
IT'S FINE.

39:14.800 --> 39:17.098
ALRIG HT. . .

39:17.100 --> 39:19.227
I SHOULD GO.

39:26.660 --> 39:28.355
( door closing )

39:36.000 --> 39:37.854
HE'S READY.

39:59.000 --> 40:00.729
OH.

40:06.200 --> 40:08.794
MI AMOR.

40:27.030 --> 40:30.796
( Spanish music playing )

40:37.960 --> 40:39.598
WHO THE FUCK
ARE YOU ?

40:39.600 --> 40:42.489
HOW DID YOU CONVINCE MY MOTHER
TO LEAVE YOU HER LIFE SAVINGS ?

40:42.500 --> 40:44.229
I DIDN'T CONVINCE YOUR MOTHER
OF ANYTHING, OKAY ?

40:44.230 --> 40:45.959
THAT WAS MY MONEY
SHE LEFT YOU.

40:45.960 --> 40:47.723
I SENT HER
$2,500 A MONTH.

40:47.730 --> 40:50.893
MY ATTORNEYS HAVE COUNSELED ME
THAT THIS IS HIGHLY SUSPECT.

40:50.900 --> 40:53.027
SHE LEFT YOU EVERYTHING

40:53.030 --> 40:55.055
AND YET I HAVE
NO IDEA WHO YOU ARE.

40:55.060 --> 40:56.391
MAYBE YOU DON'T KNOW
WHO I AM,

40:56.400 --> 40:58.027
BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T
SPEAK TO HER VERY OFTEN.

40:58.030 --> 40:59.998
I CALLED HER
EVERY OTHER SUNDAY, MY FRIEND.

41:00.000 --> 41:01.149
YEAH, I KNOW.

41:01.160 --> 41:03.253
ONCE WHEN WE INVITED HER
TO A BARBECUE AND SHE SAID

41:03.260 --> 41:04.989
SHE COULDN'T COME
BECAUSE THERE WAS A CHANCE

41:05.000 --> 41:06.820
HER ANDRESITO
MIGHT CALL.

41:06.830 --> 41:08.127
YEAH, A CHANCE.

41:09.730 --> 41:12.051
HEY, LISTEN.

41:12.060 --> 41:13.721
YOU KNOW, I'M AS SURPRISED
AS YOU ARE.

41:13.730 --> 41:15.823
OKAY ?
I AM.

41:15.830 --> 41:17.889
AS SURPRISED
AS YOU ARE.

41:20.430 --> 41:23.251
YOU SURE
EVERYTHING'S OKAY, MA'AM ?

41:23.260 --> 41:24.727
YEAH,
I'M SURE.

41:24.730 --> 41:26.698
THANK YOU, YOU PEOPLE
CAN LEAVE NOW, OKAY ?

41:26.700 --> 41:27.894
WE'RE FINE.

41:27.900 --> 41:30.027
YOU SURE.

41:37.200 --> 41:41.250
OH, NO, YOU DIDN'T
JUST WALK INTO MY HOUSE

41:41.260 --> 41:42.818
WITHOUT
A SEARCH WARRANT.

41:42.830 --> 41:44.092
OH, NO,
I DID.

41:44.100 --> 41:45.920
THIS IS BULLSHIT, ALRIGHT ?
YOU CAN'T DO THIS.

41:45.930 --> 41:47.397
SIR, IT'S THE LAW THAT
WE CAN ENTER YOUR RESIDENCE

41:47.400 --> 41:49.129
TO INVESTIGATE
A DOMESTIC ABUSE CALL.

41:49.130 --> 41:50.495
OKAY, CALM DOWN.

41:50.500 --> 41:52.127
WE JUST WANT TO TALK
TO THE BOTH OF YOU
FOR A FEW MINUTES.

41:52.130 --> 41:53.757
I KNOW THE LAW AND I KNOW
YOU CAN'T COME INTO MY HOME

41:53.760 --> 41:55.159
WITHOUT
A SEARCH WARRANT.

41:55.160 --> 41:56.388
IS YOUR NAME
ON THE LEASE, SIR ?

41:56.400 --> 41:58.322
IS THAT ANY
OF YOUR BUSINESS ?

41:58.330 --> 41:59.752
YOU NEED
TO BACK UP, SIR.

41:59.760 --> 42:01.022
THIS IS
MY FUCKING HOUSE !

42:01.030 --> 42:02.725
I'M WARNING YOU, SIR,
YOU NEED TO BACK UP--

42:02.730 --> 42:04.493
YEAH, WELL YOU CAN WARN ME
ALL THE FUCK YOU WANT,

42:04.500 --> 42:06.821
'CAUSE I KNOW
WHAT MY RIGHTS ARE !

42:06.830 --> 42:08.718
STOP IT !
STOP IT !

42:08.730 --> 42:10.652
LET GO OF HIM,
MY GOD !

42:10.660 --> 42:12.059
LET GO !

42:12.060 --> 42:13.459
CALM DOWN,
CALM DOWN.

42:13.460 --> 42:14.859
KEITH !

42:14.860 --> 42:17.090
EASY, EASY, BUDDY.

42:17.100 --> 42:18.158
LET HIM GO.

42:18.160 --> 42:19.092
KEITH,
C'MON, C'MON.

42:19.100 --> 42:20.920
IT'S OVER, ALRIGHT ?

42:20.930 --> 42:22.158
IT'S OVER.

42:22.160 --> 42:25.049
( female )
WHAT DID YOU DO ?

42:45.700 --> 42:48.726
SHE GAVE THEM TO ME
WHEN I WAS A BOY.

42:50.600 --> 42:54.127
IT'S NICE THAT
YOU KEPT THEM.

42:55.430 --> 42:58.729
I HAVEN'T BEEN TO MASS
IN OVER TWO YEARS.

43:02.530 --> 43:05.852
THESE ARE
MY TWO BOYS.

43:06.900 --> 43:09.323
THIS IS AUGUSTO
AND THIS IS JULIO.

43:09.330 --> 43:11.423
THEY CALLED HER
ABUELITA.

43:59.230 --> 44:00.697
HEY.

44:00.700 --> 44:02.588
NEED SOME HELP ?

44:02.600 --> 44:04.693
SURE, KIDDO.

44:16.200 --> 44:17.952
THANK YOU.

44:17.960 --> 44:19.393
NO, THANK YOU,

44:19.400 --> 44:21.857
FOR HOW YOU
FIXED UP MY FATHER.

44:21.860 --> 44:24.021
OH, GLAD
I COULD DO IT.

44:24.030 --> 44:27.557
I LOST MY FATHER
A FEW YEARS BACK.

44:27.560 --> 44:29.289
REALLY ?

44:29.300 --> 44:31.518
YEAH, THE WORST THING IS
HOW IT COMES UP ON YOU.

44:31.530 --> 44:32.895
FROM NOTHING.

44:32.900 --> 44:35.653
WHEN MY DAD DIED I STILL HAD
A PAIR OF BASEBALL TICKETS

44:35.660 --> 44:37.127
I'D BOUGHT WHILE
HE WAS ALIVE.

44:37.130 --> 44:38.757
AND, YOU KNOW,
WHEN WE ALL THOUGHT

44:38.760 --> 44:41.627
OF COURSE HE'LL
BE AROUND NEXT SUNDAY.

44:42.830 --> 44:45.628
WE NEVER REALLY
WENT TO GAMES.

44:52.130 --> 44:56.021
MR. FISHER, IF YOU EVER
NEED ANY HELP AROUND HERE,

44:56.030 --> 44:59.921
LIKE CUTTING THE GRASS
OR LIKE A PART-TIME JOB,

44:59.930 --> 45:01.818
I'D BE MORE THAN HAPPY.

45:01.830 --> 45:04.492
I'LL KEEP
THAT IN MIND.

45:07.860 --> 45:09.748
BYE, MR. FISHER,
THAN KS.

45:10.530 --> 45:11.792
OKAY.

45:25.930 --> 45:27.921
THERE WAS A PERSON
AT BOTH ATM's.

45:27.930 --> 45:29.818
SO, I STARTED MY OWN LINE
INBETWEEN THE TWO ATM'S.

45:29.830 --> 45:31.252
BUT THEN
THIS WOMAN COMES UP,

45:31.260 --> 45:32.955
SHE STARTS HER OWN LINE
BEHIND ONE OF THE ATM's.

45:32.960 --> 45:34.496
I SAID, I ALREADY
STARTED A LINE.

45:34.500 --> 45:35.819
SO, SHE GOES--

45:35.830 --> 45:37.889
SHE GOES WHAT ?

45:37.900 --> 45:41.427
SHE GOES,
SHE GOES, UM...

45:41.430 --> 45:43.398
BREN, YOU KNOW HIM ?

45:44.600 --> 45:47.728
OH, GOD, I THINK
I'VE SEEN HIM AROUND.

45:47.730 --> 45:48.924
'SUP ?

45:48.930 --> 45:50.818
KYLE.

45:50.830 --> 45:51.922
NATE.

45:51.930 --> 45:53.921
NEVER CAUGHT
YOUR NAME.

45:53.930 --> 45:55.557
OH, BRENDA.

45:55.560 --> 45:57.096
RIGHT.

46:02.930 --> 46:04.625
( coughing )

46:04.630 --> 46:06.052
WHOA.

46:06.060 --> 46:07.721
THIS IS
THE KIND KIND.

46:07.730 --> 46:10.699
BOTH MY CONNECTIONS
TOTALLY DRIED UP.

46:10.700 --> 46:13.749
ONE OF 'EM GOT ARRESTED AND
THE OTHER ONE I HAD TO BLOW OFF,

46:13.760 --> 46:15.648
'CAUSE HE WAS AN ACTOR
AND HE KEPT MAKING ME COME

46:15.660 --> 46:18.254
TO HIS ONE-MAN SHOWS
IF I WANTED TO BUY A BAG.

46:19.830 --> 46:22.526
FUCKIN'
BEAUTEOUS DAY, HUH ?

46:22.530 --> 46:24.395
WARM .

46:24.400 --> 46:26.721
YEAH, I'M ACTUALLY
GETTING BURNT.

46:26.730 --> 46:27.924
I'M GONNA GO INSIDE.

46:27.930 --> 46:28.919
CIAO.

46:28.930 --> 46:30.022
GOOD TO MEET YA.

46:30.030 --> 46:31.554
GOOD TO MEET
YOU TOO, BRO.

46:31.560 --> 46:34.893
GOOD TO SEE YOU
AGAIN, BRENDA.

46:42.560 --> 46:43.492
LATE.

46:48.700 --> 46:50.429
WHAT ?

46:50.430 --> 46:51.897
NATE ?

46:55.830 --> 46:57.297
WHAT ?

46:58.700 --> 47:00.258
TURN IT ON.

47:00.260 --> 47:01.352
NATE, PLEASE--

47:01.360 --> 47:02.452
TURN IT ON.

47:02.460 --> 47:05.554
ALRIGHT...
FICTION, MY ASS !

47:05.560 --> 47:08.290
SO, EVERYTHING
YOU'VE WRITTEN IN HERE
YOU'VE ACTUALLY DONE ?

47:08.300 --> 47:10.154
NO.

47:10.160 --> 47:11.457
I WANT YOU TO
READ THIS SHIT ALOUD TO ME
AND TELL ME WHAT'S TRUE !

47:11.460 --> 47:12.597
IT'S MY WRITING,
IT'S PRIVATE !

47:12.600 --> 47:13.749
YOU CAN'T--

47:13.760 --> 47:14.692
I DON'T CARE, YOU DON'T
GET TO BE PRIVATE ANYMORE.

47:14.700 --> 47:15.928
NOW, GODDAMNIT,
TELL ME THE TRUTH !

47:15.930 --> 47:17.158
GIVE IT BACK TO ME.

47:17.160 --> 47:18.092
WHO THE FUCK
DO YOU THINK YOU ARE ?

47:18.100 --> 47:18.998
WHO THE FUCK
AMI ?

47:19.000 --> 47:21.298
WHO THE FUCK
ARE YOU ?

47:23.000 --> 47:25.423
YOU KNOW
WHO I AM, NATE !

47:25.430 --> 47:27.751
I'M THE WOMAN THAT FUCKED YOU
IN THE CLOSET OF AN AIRPORT,

47:27.760 --> 47:29.250
A COUPLE HOURS
AFTER I MET YOU.

47:29.260 --> 47:31.728
THAT'S WHO I WAS
THE DAY WE MET.

47:31.730 --> 47:35.188
YOU REALLY
FUCKED TWO GUYS ?

47:35.200 --> 47:36.792
YOU HAD SEX
WITH TWO WOMEN ONCE.

47:36.800 --> 47:38.688
NOT WHEN I WAS
ENGAGED TO YOU !

47:38.700 --> 47:40.395
OH NO, YOU ONLY HAD SEX
WITH ONE WOMAN

47:40.400 --> 47:41.628
WHEN YOU WERE
ENGAGED TO ME.

47:41.630 --> 47:42.995
WITHOUT A CONDOM,
I MIGHT ADD !

47:43.000 --> 47:44.194
WHERE'D YOU FUCK 'EM ?
DID YOU FUCK HIM HERE ?

47:44.200 --> 47:45.599
DID YOU FUCK 'EM
IN OUR BED ?

47:45.600 --> 47:47.249
WHY DIDN'T YOU JUST
BREAK UP WITH ME ?

47:47.260 --> 47:48.420
JESUS CHRIST.

47:48.430 --> 47:49.897
I DON'T KNOW,
I DON'T KNOW WHY I DID IT !

47:49.900 --> 47:52.789
I DON'T KNOW,
I FUCKING WISH TO GOD I DID !

47:57.400 --> 48:00.153
DID YOU
FUCK YOUR BROTHER ?

48:00.160 --> 48:02.048
OH, RIGHT, GO THERE.

48:02.060 --> 48:03.220
WELL, WHY NOT GO THERE,
DID YOU ?

48:03.230 --> 48:04.595
DID YOU FUCK THE RABBI ?
I KNOW YOU WANTED TO.

48:04.600 --> 48:05.953
NO!

48:05.960 --> 48:07.029
I'LL BET IT WAS
BECAUSE SHE WOULDN'T.

48:07.030 --> 48:08.258
AND JUST
FOR THE RECORD ?

48:08.260 --> 48:09.750
YOU DID IT IN SEATTLE,
BEFORE I EVER--

48:09.760 --> 48:11.318
I WAS SCARED TO DEATH,
I JUST HAD A FUCKING SEIZURE !

48:11.330 --> 48:13.457
ANOTHER THING YOU WOULDN'T
HAVE TOLD ME ABOUT

48:13.460 --> 48:15.018
IF YOU HADN'T
BEEN FORCED TO.

48:15.030 --> 48:16.554
WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT ?
MAYBE I FELT SAFE WITH HER.

48:16.560 --> 48:18.255
WHICH, FRANKLY, IS SOMETHING
I HAVE NEVER FELT WITH YOU.

48:18.260 --> 48:20.956
OH, YOU FELT
SAFE WITH HER ?

48:20.960 --> 48:22.291
YEAH.

48:22.300 --> 48:23.619
YEAH, BECAUSE YOU WERE
LEAVING THE NEXT DAY.

48:23.630 --> 48:26.258
NATE, YOU CREATED
A HUMAN BEING !

48:26.260 --> 48:29.388
THERE'S GONNA BE ANOTHER PERSON
ON THIS PLANET NOW,

48:29.400 --> 48:32.722
A PERSON WHO MIGHT HAVE
A TOTALLY MISERABLE FUCKING LIFE

48:32.730 --> 48:34.721
AND CURSE THE FUCKING DAY
SHE WAS BORN,

48:34.730 --> 48:37.119
BECAUSE YOU ARE
WALKING OUT ON HER

48:37.130 --> 48:39.223
THE SAME WAY THAT YOU'RE
GONNA WALK OUT ON ME !

48:39.230 --> 48:40.959
LIFE DOESN'T
HAVE TO BE MISERABLE
JUST BECAUSE YOU ARE !

48:40.960 --> 48:43.053
OH, YEAH, I KNOW,
WEIRD SHIT HAPPENED TO YOU,

48:43.060 --> 48:45.722
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT,
IT HAPPENED TO ALL OF US,

48:45.730 --> 48:47.527
AND I'M SICK TO DEATH OF YOU
USING IT AS AN EXCUSE

48:47.530 --> 48:49.919
TO ACT LIKE SOME
FUCKING CUNT FROM HELL !

48:51.060 --> 48:52.857
WOW.

48:52.860 --> 48:56.523
HOW LONG HAVE YOU HATED ME
LIKE THIS, NATE ?

48:56.530 --> 48:58.418
OH, I DON'T NEED
TO HATE YOU.

48:58.430 --> 49:01.319
YOU DO A PRETTY DAMN GOOD JOB
OF HATING YOURSELF.

49:02.800 --> 49:04.620
YOU PICKED ME,
YOU KNOW !

49:04.630 --> 49:06.427
YEAH, WELL...

49:06.430 --> 49:08.557
ONLY BECAUSE I HAD NO IDEA
HOW FUCKED UP YOU REALLY ARE.

49:08.560 --> 49:11.051
THAT'S BULLSHIT,
YOU KNEW AND YOU LOVED IT,

49:11.060 --> 49:12.925
BECAUSE IT MADE YOU
FEEL GOOD ABOUT YOURSELF.

49:12.930 --> 49:14.818
OH GOD, YOU ARE
SO FULL OF SHIT.

49:14.830 --> 49:16.252
YOU JUST CAN'T SEE IT.

49:16.260 --> 49:18.296
BECAUSE YOU'RE
SO IN LOVE WITH THE IDEA

49:18.300 --> 49:20.495
OF NATE, THE GOOD GUY,
NATE, THE HERO,

49:20.500 --> 49:23.298
NATE, THE FUCKING SAINT WITH
THE FUCKING GREAT HAIRCUT,

49:23.300 --> 49:25.518
THE TRUTH IS YOU WOULD
RUN FROM REAL LOVE

49:25.530 --> 49:26.792
IF IT EVER CAME AT YOU--

49:26.800 --> 49:29.121
REAL LOVE, WHAT THE FUCK
DO YOU KNOW ABOUT REAL LOVE ?

49:29.130 --> 49:32.019
WITH THE SHIT,
AND THE NEEDINESS,
AND THE UGLINESS,

49:32.030 --> 49:33.759
AND THE RESPONSIBILITY.

49:33.760 --> 49:36.399
YOU WOULD FUCKING RUN,
AND YOU KNOW IT !

49:36.400 --> 49:38.789
THE ONLY REASON
YOU STAYED WITH ME

49:38.800 --> 49:41.257
IS BECAUSE I WAS
NEVER REALLY HERE !

49:45.730 --> 49:48.392
YOU KNOW WHAT,
TAKE YOUR UGLY FUCKING RING.

49:48.400 --> 49:49.958
DON'T YOU
THROW THAT RING AT ME.

49:49.960 --> 49:53.293
THAT'S SUCH A FUCKING CLICHE,
I'LL FUCKING BARF.

49:54.630 --> 49:56.598
THERE, BARF.

50:24.260 --> 50:28.993
( phone ringing )

50:32.360 --> 50:34.157
HELLO ?

50:34.160 --> 50:35.354
( Lisa )
Is Nate there ?

50:35.360 --> 50:36.850
I'M AFRAID HE'S NOT.

50:36.860 --> 50:39.192
IS THIS
MRS. FISHER ?

50:39.200 --> 50:40.656
YES, IT IS.

50:40.660 --> 50:44.221
Hi, this is Lisa,
Lisa Kimmel from Seattle.

50:44.230 --> 50:45.788
WHY, HELLO, DEAR.

50:45.800 --> 50:47.927
I'M SO SORRY I DIDN'T GET
A CHANCE TO SPEAK TO YOU

50:47.930 --> 50:49.295
WHEN MR. FISHER DIED.

50:49.300 --> 50:51.655
YOU WERE VERY MUCH
IN MY THOUGHTS.

50:51.660 --> 50:53.252
Aren't you sweet.

50:53.260 --> 50:54.557
WHAT A SURPRISE
TO HEAR FROM YOU.

50:54.560 --> 50:57.154
HOW IS EVERYTHING
IN SEATTLE ?

50:57.160 --> 51:00.391
NATE HASN'T TOLD YOU
WHAT'S GOING ON ?

51:00.400 --> 51:02.049
No, he hasn't
told me anything.

51:02.060 --> 51:03.493
NO ONE EVER
TELLS ME ANYTHING.

51:03.500 --> 51:04.694
IT'S PART OF BEING OLD.

51:04.700 --> 51:07.157
YEAH, WELL,
I'M IN LA. NOW.

51:07.160 --> 51:08.593
AND YOU'RE
A GRANDMOTHER.

51:08.600 --> 51:10.022
NO, DEAR,
I'M AFRAID I'M NOT.

51:10.030 --> 51:12.328
You are,
I just had a baby.

51:12.330 --> 51:13.991
Nate's baby.

51:14.000 --> 51:16.127
It's a girl.

51:16.130 --> 51:17.654
SHE WAS A COUPLE
OF WEEKS EARLY.

51:17.660 --> 51:20.595
I NAMED HER MAYA.

51:30.630 --> 51:33.258
I TOLD YA I'D BE HERE
EVERYDAY, DIDN'T I ?

51:36.600 --> 51:38.249
AARON ?

51:59.360 --> 52:02.955
( phone ringing )

52:14.100 --> 52:15.590
HEY.

52:15.600 --> 52:16.851
YOU ARE NEVER
GOING TO BELIEVE THIS.

52:16.860 --> 52:18.259
I JUST GOT A PHONE CALL
FROM STAN.

52:18.260 --> 52:20.194
KROEHNER IS FILING
FOR CHAPTER 11.

52:20.200 --> 52:22.828
_ And there's a federal
Investigation underway.

52:22.830 --> 52:25.094
Isn't that great ?

52:25.100 --> 52:27.421
YEAH, THAT'S GREAT.

52:27.430 --> 52:30.593
I guess the good guys actually
do win sometimes, huh ?

52:31.660 --> 52:33.821
Hold on,

52:38.400 --> 52:39.549
HEY, BABY.

52:39.560 --> 52:41.551
Hey, listen.

52:41.560 --> 52:43.221
I'M NOT GONNA BE
HOME FOR A WHILE.

52:43.230 --> 52:44.492
YOU WANT ME
TO HOLD DINNER ?

52:44.500 --> 52:47.628
No, no, you and Taylor
go ahead and eat.

52:47.630 --> 52:49.495
