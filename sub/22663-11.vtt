00:50.360 --> 00:53.240
- Come on.
- I'm ready.

00:53.360 --> 00:55.120
Drive.

01:12.040 --> 01:16.040
Translated by: NederSubs

01:23.960 --> 01:26.600
I did everything they asked.

01:26.720 --> 01:29.840
But Azzurra and Pietro
are still with that asshole.

01:33.600 --> 01:38.080
Despite all the fuss,
we haven't made any progress.

01:38.200 --> 01:40.280
That's not true.

01:46.760 --> 01:49.040
Just think about it.

01:49.160 --> 01:54.080
Along the way you met many friends.
Old and new ones.

01:56.880 --> 02:01.120
There is something else you can
give them, just think about it.

02:01.240 --> 02:02.640
What, then?

02:05.400 --> 02:07.760
The blood of your friends.

03:04.160 --> 03:06.760
This is Patrizia.

03:06.880 --> 03:12.320
She is the intermediary
Gennaro has chosen for the exchange.

03:12.440 --> 03:16.760
We're here together, with the
souls in Purgatory as witnesses,

03:16.880 --> 03:19.840
to give him our answer.

03:19.960 --> 03:23.640
You'll speak first, Giuseppe.

03:23.760 --> 03:27.360
Do you want to give your daughter
and grandson to Gennaro

03:27.480 --> 03:30.960
in exchange for Blue Blood?

03:31.080 --> 03:33.920
I don't agree with it.

03:34.040 --> 03:35.800
I'm fine with it.

03:37.360 --> 03:43.680
I think it's in everyone's interest
if we trade Enzo Villa for his family.

03:43.800 --> 03:48.080
Are you sure?
We've already destroyed Genny.

03:48.200 --> 03:52.800
And he no longer has a grip on
Enzo and his mates.

03:52.920 --> 03:58.440
- That monkey has a double advantage.
- But we also benefit from it.

03:58.560 --> 04:05.680
We're rid of those guys
and we can take back Forcella.

04:05.800 --> 04:08.800
Don Ruggiero, may I say something?

04:08.920 --> 04:15.000
Patrizia, what does Ciro di Marzio
say about Gennaro's proposal?

04:15.120 --> 04:17.800
I don't know.

04:17.920 --> 04:22.640
But until now,
Ciro has always stood behind Genny.

04:22.760 --> 04:28.360
I think he would even
follow Genny to hell.

04:28.480 --> 04:32.560
And we make sure he'll never resurface.

04:32.680 --> 04:37.560
Without Ciro di Marzio,
Gennaro Savastano is nobody.

05:30.680 --> 05:33.280
- Freeze. Quiet.
- What are you doing?

05:34.440 --> 05:35.840
Asshole.

06:11.840 --> 06:13.240
Let's go.

06:41.560 --> 06:43.200
Give it to me.

06:48.400 --> 06:52.280
Are you here to work?
Do you have the money with you?

06:52.400 --> 06:55.080
Step back, you need to wait.

06:55.200 --> 06:58.360
- Gennaro?
- He's in the back.

07:00.640 --> 07:04.960
Your security was no good.
That's the problem.

07:05.080 --> 07:10.480
Hence all those robberies in your store.
But rest assured, we're here now.

07:12.840 --> 07:14.720
You're in good hands.

07:17.120 --> 07:18.560
Sign here.

07:19.840 --> 07:24.040
- Did you see it?
- What is this place?

07:24.160 --> 07:28.160
- A new business.
- Private security?

07:29.480 --> 07:35.400
Everyone has something valuable
that they want to protect at all costs.

07:41.320 --> 07:44.360
- Remember, Rosario.
- Everything is alright.

07:47.040 --> 07:50.720
And nobody can protect them
as well as I do.

07:59.640 --> 08:01.320
Did you talk to them?

08:03.720 --> 08:05.760
What did they say?

08:05.880 --> 08:09.480
They agree with the exchange,
including Don Avitabile.

08:09.600 --> 08:12.920
But there's a problem.

08:13.040 --> 08:15.200
He thinks your offer is not enough.

08:18.440 --> 08:19.840
What does he want?

08:22.320 --> 08:25.800
He also wants Ciro.

08:45.480 --> 08:51.040
- Gennaro has accepted everything.
- He accepted it? Good.

08:51.160 --> 08:55.720
As long as I'm the intermediary,
he agrees with everything.

08:59.440 --> 09:01.440
Do you want to tell me something else?

09:08.640 --> 09:10.040
He wants to speak to you.

09:12.160 --> 09:14.960
Does he want to make me an offer?

09:15.080 --> 09:18.240
He's really at rock bottom.

09:18.360 --> 09:21.760
He wants to stop the war
and continue dealing.

09:21.880 --> 09:25.560
But he's afraid of how you'd react.

09:25.680 --> 09:29.120
Without your support,
Secondigliano will revolt,

09:29.240 --> 09:33.040
and then he's lost that business as well.

09:33.160 --> 09:37.120
Good, let him be afraid.

09:37.240 --> 09:41.240
The moment has come
to crush Genny for good.

09:48.640 --> 09:51.920
Think twice about it.

09:52.040 --> 09:57.080
Before the exchange,
there's still time to hurt him even more.

09:57.200 --> 10:02.320
I told him to make you a proposal,
to keep you happy.

10:38.400 --> 10:41.560
A room has been prepared
for you and Pietro.

11:43.800 --> 11:45.320
Gennaro is in the back.

11:54.160 --> 11:55.600
Hello, Gennaro.

11:56.800 --> 11:59.840
And, do you like it?

11:59.960 --> 12:02.760
I've always hated guards.

12:02.880 --> 12:05.040
Even if they work for you?

12:06.600 --> 12:10.400
You were on my side when I needed you.

12:10.520 --> 12:12.840
And I never forget anything.

12:12.960 --> 12:16.800
I thought you'd want to be
my partner in this business.

12:16.920 --> 12:21.120
Wow, thanks.
First grave digger, and now a guard.

12:21.240 --> 12:27.640
I'd rather have that statue
in Piazza Garibaldi you promised me.

12:27.760 --> 12:31.800
- We can forget about downtown.
- Really?

12:31.920 --> 12:37.520
I can't take any more risks.
And we can walk into Secondigliano

12:37.640 --> 12:40.920
without risking our lives
or jail time.

12:41.040 --> 12:45.400
I knew you were unfit for the System.
It's nothing for you.

12:45.520 --> 12:50.200
I'll tell you what we do.
We'll both go our separate ways.

12:50.320 --> 12:54.000
But I want the money back I gave you.

12:54.120 --> 12:56.720
As soon as I make a profit again.

12:56.840 --> 12:59.080
There's no time for that.

13:03.120 --> 13:06.800
Do you know what I think, Gennaro?

13:06.920 --> 13:13.840
If all these businesses were mine,
I'd forget about downtown in a heartbeat.

13:16.200 --> 13:18.360
Stay strong.

13:42.880 --> 13:44.880
Your father wants to see you.

13:51.760 --> 13:55.240
- Hello?
- Do you recognize the place where you are?

13:59.480 --> 14:00.880
No.

14:01.000 --> 14:06.520
I used to take you here as a child,
in the summer.

14:06.640 --> 14:08.880
You were just as little
as Pietro is now.

14:12.960 --> 14:15.760
He loves you very much.

14:15.880 --> 14:18.800
He would do everything to get you back.

14:18.920 --> 14:22.120
"Do you want this? Then you'll get this."

14:26.000 --> 14:29.520
Look around you, Azzurra.

14:29.640 --> 14:35.240
The things you see
are not only your past.

14:35.360 --> 14:37.800
They will also be your future.

15:14.080 --> 15:16.880
Did it go as I thought?

15:19.880 --> 15:22.080
He also wants your head.

15:28.320 --> 15:29.720
Cianel.

15:35.160 --> 15:38.080
You know this is very risky, right?

15:40.080 --> 15:42.640
Our life is one big risk.

15:45.640 --> 15:49.800
- What does Enzo think?
- He already said yes.

15:51.000 --> 15:54.080
Enzo is on our side.

15:58.080 --> 16:03.440
Tomorrow at three o'clock, you have to be
at the crockery warehouse. Enzo stays there.

16:03.560 --> 16:08.160
Charming's men will only come
when I've seen Azzurra and Pietro.

16:12.720 --> 16:14.240
What is it?

16:14.360 --> 16:17.360
It was nice to walk together a bit.

16:20.680 --> 16:24.480
- Our ways won't part.
- That is not important.

16:26.200 --> 16:29.960
What happens, happens.
I stay where I am.

16:57.400 --> 16:59.840
Is this the revenue?

16:59.960 --> 17:04.839
- And? What do you think?
- These are good businesses.

17:04.960 --> 17:08.640
- Gennaro is giving you a gem.
- Poor Gennaro.

17:08.760 --> 17:12.720
He worked his ass off
to bring in those people,

17:12.839 --> 17:15.760
and now all the money is for me.

17:15.880 --> 17:20.520
I knew you were good,
but you're really great.

17:20.640 --> 17:25.359
First, you took everything away from him.
Now, you're pushing him to the graveyard.

17:29.480 --> 17:33.760
Why the long face?
I never forget my friends.

17:33.880 --> 17:36.840
When I become a queen,
you'll be the prince.

17:52.240 --> 17:54.600
Here is the money you asked for.

17:56.000 --> 17:57.840
Thanks.

17:59.520 --> 18:03.160
If everything goes well,
I'll give it back to you tomorrow.

18:05.120 --> 18:08.120
And otherwise I have to think about
Maria and Cosimo.

18:10.640 --> 18:13.360
He's with family for the time being.

18:22.560 --> 18:23.960
Are you afraid?

18:28.320 --> 18:30.720
If you were, I'd understand.

18:32.720 --> 18:36.680
I've lost so much.

18:36.800 --> 18:38.840
And now I want to take revenge.

18:40.720 --> 18:42.920
And that can kill me.

18:44.840 --> 18:49.600
You won't die.
You'll grow stronger, I promise you.

18:55.680 --> 18:58.520
What do your buddies say?

18:58.640 --> 19:00.800
We can count on everyone.

19:03.480 --> 19:04.880
Great.

19:08.160 --> 19:10.520
We meet tomorrow, here.

19:33.520 --> 19:36.560
What's with that bag?

19:36.680 --> 19:39.280
For you and Cosimo,
if I don't come back.

19:39.400 --> 19:44.240
What? Do you know
what I'm going to do with that money?

19:44.360 --> 19:49.200
I'll buy a hot air balloon. At the wedding,
we'll fly to the reception.

19:49.320 --> 19:51.360
That's what I'm going to do
with this money.

20:21.360 --> 20:22.760
They're there.

20:34.600 --> 20:39.160
If anything happens to me, you have to
take care of Azzurra and Pietro.

20:39.280 --> 20:41.120
I will.

22:06.840 --> 22:08.480
Come here, sweetie.

24:20.920 --> 24:25.600
They're going to San Giovanni a Teduccio,
the exact location follows. Come on.

24:41.960 --> 24:46.600
Remember, Patrizia.
Our fate is now in your hands.

25:32.440 --> 25:35.040
We're heading for him now.

25:37.280 --> 25:38.680
So it's true?

26:01.280 --> 26:04.000
- Are you ready?
- Are <i>you</i> ready?

26:04.120 --> 26:09.120
I'll do everything you say,
but I want to tell you one thing:

26:09.240 --> 26:11.400
I understand
that you want to take revenge.

26:11.520 --> 26:16.480
But Ciro asks you to risk your life
for Savastano's son.

26:16.600 --> 26:20.360
And I don't understand
why you risk so much for him.

26:20.480 --> 26:25.600
We're not doing this for Gennaro,
but for us. To settle the score.

26:25.720 --> 26:31.640
And without his drugs, we'll become
what we were before all this: street boys.

26:31.760 --> 26:34.760
Would that be so bad?

26:34.880 --> 26:36.800
Right now it would.

26:39.760 --> 26:43.400
If something happens to you, anything...

26:45.480 --> 26:47.200
I will kill them all.

27:51.080 --> 27:53.000
Wait here.

30:33.360 --> 30:35.120
Go.

31:46.480 --> 31:50.160
After the railway bridge,
the crockery warehouse in San Giovanni.

32:01.040 --> 32:04.680
A crockery warehouse,
after the railway bridge.

32:52.840 --> 32:56.600
What's the matter? Isn't Ciro there?

32:56.720 --> 32:59.720
He didn't show up.

32:59.840 --> 33:02.360
Then we'll let you die alone.

33:02.480 --> 33:04.800
- Stop.
- Weapons down.

33:06.720 --> 33:10.240
- Throw away your gun.
- Put it down, assholes.

33:10.360 --> 33:13.400
Freeze, or I'll kill you.

33:13.520 --> 33:15.880
I'm going to kill you.

33:16.000 --> 33:19.200
- Freeze, motherfucker.
- Put it down.

33:22.280 --> 33:24.000
On the ground.

33:31.280 --> 33:33.360
On the ground, now.

33:34.720 --> 33:36.160
I'm not alone.

33:50.720 --> 33:53.080
Call him and tell him
everything is alright.

33:56.560 --> 33:59.040
Do you want to be a hero?

34:24.679 --> 34:28.800
Any more heroes?

34:35.719 --> 34:38.560
Starting tomorrow,
your neighborhood is ours.

34:38.679 --> 34:44.920
Everyone gets a job, a house and a car.

34:45.040 --> 34:47.000
And our respect.

34:48.280 --> 34:50.280
Call him.

34:50.400 --> 34:53.679
Tell him Ciro and I are dead,
and he is too.

36:34.560 --> 36:36.600
Where is Patrizia?

36:43.880 --> 36:45.520
Come on, we have to go.

36:57.320 --> 37:01.000
Come to daddy.
We have to leave here.

37:05.240 --> 37:07.240
What is it?

37:07.360 --> 37:09.720
Did you think I betrayed you?

38:19.480 --> 38:21.280
They're back.

39:19.560 --> 39:21.040
That's Ciro.

39:57.360 --> 39:59.600
NEXT TIME
