WEBVTT

00:11.583 --> 00:12.625
Ahh!

00:12.625 --> 00:14.375
- Simon!
- Darling.

00:14.375 --> 00:16.416
You're finally here.

00:16.416 --> 00:19.166
I've been looking forward to this weekend
for so long.

00:19.166 --> 00:20.333
Me too.

00:20.333 --> 00:21.916
Oh, and I got you a gift.

00:21.916 --> 00:24.791
I had a feeling
you were gonna get me that,

00:24.791 --> 00:26.791
so I got you somewhere to put it.

00:26.791 --> 00:28.583
- Oh, Walty.
- Oh!

00:28.583 --> 00:30.708
Yes, unwrap me!

00:30.708 --> 00:32.708
I adore making love in a bubble bath.

00:32.708 --> 00:36.791
- It's so dirty.
- And yet so clean.

00:36.791 --> 00:38.166
Oh, Simon!

00:38.166 --> 00:40.833
I can't believe we're having sex
everywhere but your bedroom.

00:40.833 --> 00:45.250
Ooh, let's do it
in the shared laundry room next.

00:46.625 --> 00:48.541
Uh, hey, are you wearing my sweater?

00:48.541 --> 00:51.791
You're not supposed to leave
your laundry unattended.

00:51.791 --> 00:56.250
I can't believe
we've been making love for 48 hours.

00:56.250 --> 00:58.916
I can't believe
you can Postmates a chocolate fountain.

00:58.916 --> 01:02.666
Yeah, it's very romantic. And convenient.

01:02.666 --> 01:05.125
Hey, Walter,
what's going on in that noggin?

01:05.125 --> 01:10.125
It's just the weekend's almost over,
and long distance is so hard.

01:10.125 --> 01:12.541
I... I wish you didn't have to go.

01:12.541 --> 01:15.083
- Well, what if I didn't?
- What do you mean?

01:15.083 --> 01:18.500
Well, humans in New Zealand
have socialized sex,

01:18.500 --> 01:21.541
so Hormone Monsters
are basically redundant.

01:21.541 --> 01:23.916
- Really?
- And I could use a change of scenery.

01:23.916 --> 01:25.250
- So you'd move here?
- Yeah.

01:25.250 --> 01:26.333
- Relocate?
- Gladly.

01:26.333 --> 01:28.500
Change your address to my address?

01:28.500 --> 01:31.791
Why not? Who wouldn't want
to feel this happy all the time?

01:31.791 --> 01:35.083
Holy shit! I've wanted this for so long.

01:35.083 --> 01:36.375
We're gonna be a real couple,

01:36.375 --> 01:38.333
like Mickey the Mouse
and Minnie the Mouse.

01:38.333 --> 01:42.125
Now, baby, let's go back
to the laundry room and get goofy.

01:42.125 --> 01:44.416
Oh, Simon.

01:44.416 --> 01:46.083
Ohh-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

01:46.083 --> 01:50.416

02:23.125 --> 02:25.666
Paul, we are killing it.

02:25.666 --> 02:28.916
I've got a new hubby,
and you've got a new hobby.

02:28.916 --> 02:31.041
Yeah, I even got it
over the net this time.

02:31.041 --> 02:33.416
And the teacher
seemed less mad at me, right?

02:33.416 --> 02:38.291
And I'm <i>loving</i> your hairy legs
in these itty-bitty tennis shorts.

02:38.291 --> 02:41.000
Yeah, I-I think
they're the little alligator brand.

02:41.000 --> 02:41.958
Aww!

02:41.958 --> 02:44.625
Those are from CVS and that is a snail.

02:44.625 --> 02:47.166
But go off, honey.

02:47.875 --> 02:48.875
Oh!

02:48.875 --> 02:50.208
She's good.

02:50.875 --> 02:51.958
Hmm.

02:51.958 --> 02:53.583
- Paul! Paul!
- Oh.

02:53.583 --> 02:55.083
- Paul?
- Paul!

02:55.083 --> 02:56.708
My name is Paul.

02:56.708 --> 03:00.500
I feel kinda weird.
Like I drank soda too fast.

03:00.500 --> 03:03.291
It's called getting horny.

03:03.291 --> 03:04.750
Maury? Is that you?

03:04.750 --> 03:07.458
Paul, you old scamp,
I haven't seen you in forever.

03:07.458 --> 03:09.083
How are we fucking Evelyn tonight?

03:09.083 --> 03:13.125
For the love of God, Maury,
read your client's files.

03:13.125 --> 03:14.958
Evelyn passed away last year.

03:14.958 --> 03:17.000
- Yikes. My condolences.
- Ugh.

03:17.000 --> 03:18.708
But, uh, congrats on being horny.

03:18.708 --> 03:21.875
That's nice. That's good for you, right?
It's good to-- It's fun to be hard.

03:21.875 --> 03:25.833
Oh, I guess I am rather aroused.
Is-- Is that okay?

03:25.833 --> 03:27.708
It is most certainly not okay.

03:27.708 --> 03:30.333
Yeah, that's right.
Your wife's corpse is still warm.

03:30.333 --> 03:31.333
Oh God.

03:31.333 --> 03:35.166
And your wrinkly old balls
are dripping out of your snail shorts.

03:35.166 --> 03:36.125
Oh, come on!

03:36.125 --> 03:39.833
What? His whole situation
looks like a sad turkey.

03:39.833 --> 03:43.333
Hey, just because he's old and gross,
doesn't mean he can't be horny.

03:43.333 --> 03:46.416
- Uh, thank you?
- And what are you even doing here?

03:46.416 --> 03:47.708
I'm his protégé.

03:47.708 --> 03:51.791
Yes, they're shadowing me,
so that I might mold them in my image.

03:51.791 --> 03:55.583
- Eww!
- Montel is the clay and I, the potter.

03:55.583 --> 03:58.541
- Stop it, please.
- Everybody, shut it.

03:58.541 --> 04:01.708
Paul has grieved,
and now his penis is erect,

04:01.708 --> 04:06.375
so let's all work together to figure out
what to do with this boner, okay?

04:06.375 --> 04:10.000
He could stick it in the ground
with his dead wife.

04:10.000 --> 04:13.666
Oh, Montel,
you sure "served" him.

04:13.666 --> 04:15.083
Oh, for fuck's sake.

04:15.083 --> 04:18.291
Well, the good news is
I'm not erect anymore.

04:18.291 --> 04:20.250
No, that's terrible news.

04:20.250 --> 04:22.583
We want you like the Saturday crossword.

04:22.583 --> 04:24.416
Always hard.

04:25.750 --> 04:29.125
- Ugh, troubled sigh.
- Something wrong, Emmy?

04:29.125 --> 04:32.083
Well, if you must know,
it's my client, Sarah.

04:32.083 --> 04:34.958
- She's totally ignoring me.
- Well, I'm sure that brings her peace.

04:34.958 --> 04:39.000
Ever since I asked her about her mother,
she and Van have been shutting me out.

04:39.000 --> 04:41.375
And Van built a wall around her.

04:41.375 --> 04:44.750
A wall, wow. That's something
I wish my cubicle had.

04:44.750 --> 04:46.791
Pete, help me.

04:46.791 --> 04:50.333
Okay, I give up.
What's the deal with Sarah's mom?

04:50.333 --> 04:52.458
I don't know. I mean, she won't say.

04:52.458 --> 04:54.583
And I assume you already tried
the Memory Bank?

04:54.583 --> 04:58.541
No, I didn't try
the Memory Bank.

04:58.541 --> 04:59.750
Why are you mad at me?

04:59.750 --> 05:04.875
Because it's a good idea,
and I don't wanna do it.

05:04.875 --> 05:09.166
Ugh! Emmy! Now my outgoing
is mixed with my incoming.

05:09.166 --> 05:11.708
All right, time for my
three-o'clock yogurt,

05:11.708 --> 05:13.208
the bridge to dinner.

05:13.208 --> 05:17.250
Hold on now. My special yogurt,
it's not in its special place.

05:18.208 --> 05:21.916
How am I to get an old man hard
on an empty stomach?

05:22.541 --> 05:25.333
I'm telling you, Walter,
it's a good suggestion.

05:25.333 --> 05:26.708
I'm so sorry I'm late.

05:26.708 --> 05:30.041
I just got some very disturbing news
right before I walked in here.

05:30.041 --> 05:33.666
Uh-huh. Well, your child and Lionel
were just suggesting

05:33.666 --> 05:37.875
that maybe Paul should lop off his penis
and throw it into an incinerator.

05:37.875 --> 05:39.375
The incinerator was my idea.

05:39.375 --> 05:41.291
What? We're not gonna incinerate it.

05:41.291 --> 05:44.833
We're gonna take pictures of it.
Put it on the apps. Make it a star.

05:44.833 --> 05:47.791
Okay, I love where your head's at, Maury,

05:47.791 --> 05:51.291
but maybe instead of dick pics,
we try online dating?

05:51.291 --> 05:54.083
I think we're saying the same thing,
but sure, yeah.

05:54.083 --> 05:56.458
- Online dating?
- Paul's gonna get catfished.

05:56.458 --> 05:59.458
What if he ends up
in a shipping container with no kidneys?

05:59.458 --> 06:02.041
No, no, no, no, no.
He's gonna meet new people,

06:02.041 --> 06:03.416
and it'll be great.

06:03.416 --> 06:06.791
Yeah. He's gonna fuck new people,
and it'll be anal.

06:06.791 --> 06:08.666
It's not gonna be great or anal.

06:08.666 --> 06:11.750
- It's gonna be awkward.
- And terrifying.

06:11.750 --> 06:14.125
Also, his body is weird now.

06:14.125 --> 06:17.708
Indeed, nobody wants to fornicate
with a clammy old man.

06:17.708 --> 06:20.125
Wrong. Old people sex is the best.

06:20.125 --> 06:21.625
You already know what you're doing,

06:21.625 --> 06:25.333
and everyone's skin is so loose,
it's way easier to eat ass.

06:25.333 --> 06:27.250
No, thank you. I'll stick to my yogurt.

06:27.250 --> 06:29.666
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Stop the clock.
Is that my yogurt?

06:29.666 --> 06:34.000
Well, it wasn't labeled, you see.
I assumed it was up for grabs.

06:34.000 --> 06:37.833
What? Nothing in an office fridge
is "up for grabs." That would be weird.

06:37.833 --> 06:39.125
Oh, relax, Mama Maury.

06:39.125 --> 06:41.708
- That's a weird thing to say.
- It's just a yogurt.

06:41.708 --> 06:43.583
What a weird fucking guy.

06:43.583 --> 06:46.166
All right,
we're all a little on edge here,

06:46.166 --> 06:47.958
but let's just calm down,

06:47.958 --> 06:51.666
do the online dating thing,
and never talk about yogurt again.

06:51.666 --> 06:53.625
It's actually quite delicious.

06:53.625 --> 06:56.291
- Here you go, Montel. Open wide.
- Mmm!

06:56.291 --> 06:57.541
Oh, boysenberry.

06:57.541 --> 07:01.916
Okay, I'm not gonna sit here
and watch you feed my child my yogurt.

07:01.916 --> 07:04.916
And you better believe
I'm gonna slam this door.

07:04.916 --> 07:06.416
Damn it, guys.

07:06.416 --> 07:08.833
Now I don't even remember
what we were talking about.

07:08.833 --> 07:11.125
Oh, Paul's old, weird body.

07:12.541 --> 07:14.708
Honey, I'm home.

07:14.708 --> 07:18.083
Oh my God,
I've always wanted to say that.

07:18.083 --> 07:19.916
And I've always wanted to hear it.

07:20.916 --> 07:26.791
Uh, Simon, honey, did you eat hot chili
out of my grandmother's china?

07:26.791 --> 07:30.208
Yes. It had paintings of trees on it,
and I could not resist.

07:30.208 --> 07:32.500
- Is that okay, baby?
- Oh, of course.

07:32.500 --> 07:33.750
It's just a bowl.

07:33.750 --> 07:36.458
An irreplaceable antique bowl
that I'm not obsessed with in any way.

07:36.458 --> 07:37.500
Marvelous.

07:37.500 --> 07:41.500
Now, let's have wet and wild sex
on your suede couch.

07:41.500 --> 07:42.666
Oh!

07:42.666 --> 07:44.166
Simon.

07:44.166 --> 07:46.166
Oh!

07:46.166 --> 07:48.666
Oh, sorry about my follicle leavings.

07:48.666 --> 07:51.208
It's, uh, my monthly pube shedding.

07:51.208 --> 07:54.583
Monthly? Oh dear,
and it got in the chocolate fountain.

07:54.583 --> 07:56.291
Oh, yeah, I guess a little bit did.

07:56.291 --> 07:58.458
Well, I just won't look at it.

07:58.458 --> 08:00.791
I have the best night planned for us.

08:00.791 --> 08:02.333
I picked up some Thai food,

08:02.333 --> 08:05.875
and <i>Bachelor in Paradise</i>
is about to start.

08:05.875 --> 08:08.625
Ooh, I don't watch human television.

08:08.625 --> 08:10.333
Oh my God. Why?

08:10.333 --> 08:12.958
Well, I suppose because their shows
are utter garbage.

08:12.958 --> 08:16.250
- What?
- Uh, I just find them to be cringe.

08:16.250 --> 08:17.666
- Cringe?
- Cringe.

08:17.666 --> 08:19.166
- Cringe?
- Yeah, it's just cringe.

08:19.166 --> 08:22.083
- Does that mean you don't like it?
- Maybe you just record it.

08:22.083 --> 08:26.250
Mmm, but if I don't watch it live,
I can't participate in the group chat,

08:26.250 --> 08:28.000
and I'm really funny in there.

08:28.000 --> 08:30.250
But, baby, I put on my sexy T-shirt.

08:30.250 --> 08:34.125
It is your sexy T-shirt.
It says so right there.

08:34.125 --> 08:37.208
- Hey, now, what's going on in that noggin?
- Nothing.

08:37.208 --> 08:39.166
Nothing. Let's...

08:39.166 --> 08:42.166
...skip the show
and have soul-shattering sex again.

08:42.166 --> 08:44.291
Outstanding.

08:46.333 --> 08:48.250
Cassie fell off a boat?

08:48.250 --> 08:50.875
Shit. I got jokes for that.

08:50.875 --> 08:51.875
"Widowr."

08:51.875 --> 08:57.416
"The app for people of a certain age,
dating in their final stage of life."

08:57.416 --> 09:00.166
Oh, that's you! You're almost dead.

09:00.166 --> 09:01.708
Indeed! Ha ha!

09:01.708 --> 09:04.250
No, not "ha ha."
What's the first question, Paul?

09:04.250 --> 09:07.666
Well, the thing wants to know
what's my best feature?

09:07.666 --> 09:09.041
Your high cholesterol?

09:09.041 --> 09:11.000
Your, uh, decomposing wife?

09:11.000 --> 09:13.416
No. It's your sweet hog. Your dong.

09:13.416 --> 09:14.875
Your five-dollar footlong,

09:14.875 --> 09:17.375
packed with ham and turkey
and shaved-up lettuce.

09:17.375 --> 09:18.750
I'm sorry. What?

09:18.750 --> 09:22.708
I'm hungry because someone stole
my three-o'clock yogurt.

09:22.708 --> 09:24.333
Wasn't labeled.

09:24.333 --> 09:26.375
All right, all right, all right.
How about this?

09:26.375 --> 09:32.083
"I'm a six-foot-tall man,
and I am looking for a lady."

09:32.083 --> 09:34.083
Holy moly!

09:34.083 --> 09:36.333
- I already got a match!
- Whoo-hoo-hoo!

09:36.333 --> 09:38.541
- All right, Paulie! You got a date.
- Yes!

09:38.541 --> 09:40.666
It's so fuckin' easy for tall guys.

09:41.541 --> 09:43.083
Hi. Um...

09:43.083 --> 09:46.500
Welcome to the Memory Bank,
where you can always bank on us.

09:46.500 --> 09:48.041
Aw, that's cute. I need--

09:48.041 --> 09:51.041
Scan your badge. The memories
are through there. We close at six.

09:51.041 --> 09:54.500
Oh, well, actually,
I've never been here alone,

09:54.500 --> 09:56.916
so could you maybe find
the stuff I'm looking for,

09:56.916 --> 09:59.000
and I'll wait here
and play on my phone?

09:59.000 --> 10:00.166
Also, do you have a charger?

10:00.166 --> 10:05.250
Young lady, I am quite busy keeping track
of every memory in the history of forever.

10:05.250 --> 10:06.166
But do--

10:06.166 --> 10:10.250
Simply say the memory you're looking for,
and walk through a door.

10:10.250 --> 10:13.375
If you're not a complete imbecile,
it should be there.

10:13.375 --> 10:16.916
Okay, um... Sarah's past. Woo!

10:16.916 --> 10:19.583
Oh, stop that. Just open it.

10:19.583 --> 10:21.666
All right, all right.

10:22.791 --> 10:25.958
Yeah, I hope it isn't weird that I used
to fuck a lot of these dogs.

10:25.958 --> 10:28.583
Damn, this one's way too recent. Um...

10:28.583 --> 10:30.958
Younger Sarah!

10:31.458 --> 10:33.250
Oh, good. I had to pee anyway.

10:33.250 --> 10:36.708
Yeah, my favorite classic rock band
is Vampire Weekend.

10:36.708 --> 10:40.708
Aw, look at you,
in your cute little emo phase.

10:40.708 --> 10:42.875
But I need to see you with your mom.

10:42.875 --> 10:45.583
Sarah's mom memories!

10:46.666 --> 10:49.000
Ooh, fun! Spin cycle.

10:49.000 --> 10:50.875
Whoa!

10:50.875 --> 10:53.666
What the fuck? Where am I?

10:53.666 --> 10:54.916
Um...

10:54.916 --> 10:56.458
Sarah's mom big fight.

10:56.458 --> 10:57.708
Hmm.

10:57.708 --> 11:00.416
Um, mom plus bitch plus Sarah?

11:00.416 --> 11:01.875
Ugh!

11:01.875 --> 11:05.833
Mr. Memory Banker, sir?
Your bank sucks dick.

11:05.833 --> 11:09.000
My bank most certainly
does not "suck dick."

11:09.000 --> 11:10.666
Oh my God. Can you feel this?

11:10.666 --> 11:12.666
Ohh, my face! My brain!

11:12.666 --> 11:14.666
Oh, shit! I-I'm so sorry.

11:14.666 --> 11:17.500
- I'm fine. It's hologram humor.
- Oh.

11:17.500 --> 11:18.458
L-O-L.

11:18.458 --> 11:19.750
What do you need?

11:19.750 --> 11:23.875
There's a glitch. I-I keep asking
for memories about Sarah's mom,

11:23.875 --> 11:25.750
but all I get is this empty void.

11:25.750 --> 11:29.291
That means the memories are buried.
You'll need to dig.

11:29.291 --> 11:32.333
Oh, so, like, manual labor?

11:32.333 --> 11:34.583
Get on with it, we close at six.

11:34.583 --> 11:35.666
Come on!

11:35.666 --> 11:37.083
I mean, my arms are pretty,

11:37.083 --> 11:39.583
but I'll tell you,
there's no muscles in there.

11:40.291 --> 11:41.250
Ugh!

11:41.250 --> 11:43.708
There's pubies in my Tumi.

11:43.708 --> 11:47.333
Oh yeah. Pretty exciting
about you and Simon Sex.

11:47.333 --> 11:50.416
Yeah, he's a real catch
and a thorough lover.

11:50.416 --> 11:51.958
You must be very excited.

11:51.958 --> 11:54.875
Yes, of course. So excited.

11:54.875 --> 11:58.666
But if I'm being honest,
having Simon in my space all the time

11:58.666 --> 12:00.958
is a little different
than him just visiting.

12:00.958 --> 12:03.208
- Hello, love.
- Oh! Simon!

12:03.208 --> 12:06.375
My boo. Yay!

12:06.375 --> 12:08.916
Well, I just finished my interview
with Grace.

12:08.916 --> 12:11.000
And I'm gonna be honest. I nailed it.

12:11.000 --> 12:13.500
Right. The office transfer.

12:13.500 --> 12:17.125
You know, when it goes through,
we'll be eating lunch together every day.

12:17.125 --> 12:19.708
Yes...
...because in addition to living together,

12:19.708 --> 12:22.041
we will also be working together.

12:22.041 --> 12:24.208
Spending every waking moment together.

12:24.208 --> 12:27.250
Like Gilligan,
and his husband, Mr. Skipper.

12:27.250 --> 12:29.791
We can even carpool. Just us two.

12:29.791 --> 12:31.958
Simon and Walter. Walter and Simon.

12:31.958 --> 12:34.375
Together forever, no interruptions.

12:34.375 --> 12:36.958
Hey, Walter,
what's going on in that noggin?

12:36.958 --> 12:39.916
I, uh... Hoo, it's suddenly
very hot in here.

12:39.916 --> 12:41.666
Walter, baby.

12:41.666 --> 12:44.583
- You okay?
- Yeah, what's going on in that noggin?

12:44.583 --> 12:47.583
- What the fuck?
- Looks like you need a bubble bath.

12:47.583 --> 12:49.458
Ahh! I-- I gotta go.

12:49.458 --> 12:51.250
- Ah!
- What's going on in that noggin?

12:51.250 --> 12:53.750
What's going on in that noggin?

12:53.750 --> 12:56.083
- Ahh!
- What's going on in that noggin?

12:56.083 --> 12:59.625
Stop it, all of you! Leave me alone!

13:01.666 --> 13:04.291
- Die! Die! Die! Die!
- What's going on in that noggin?

13:04.291 --> 13:05.458
Die!

13:05.458 --> 13:08.916
Darling, you've completely destroyed
your luxury lunch bag.

13:08.916 --> 13:13.500
- What's going on in that noggin?
- Nothing. Just blowing off some steam.

13:13.500 --> 13:16.208
You know me. I love to stab to relax.

13:16.208 --> 13:20.125
Same. The blade in your hand
is so soothing.

13:20.125 --> 13:21.708
Yeah, stabbing's nice.

13:21.708 --> 13:24.958
- Hello, Maurice.
- What the hell do you two want?

13:24.958 --> 13:28.416
Montel explained
that consuming unlabeled food

13:28.416 --> 13:29.833
is bad fridge etiquette,

13:29.833 --> 13:33.416
so I got you these yogurts
to replace the one I ate.

13:33.416 --> 13:36.583
No! Fuck off!
Those aren't even the right ones.

13:36.583 --> 13:41.083
Come on, now.
I want my daddy and my idol to get along.

13:41.083 --> 13:44.958
Whoa, whoa, I thought he was your mentor.
Idol seems much bigger than mentor.

13:44.958 --> 13:47.458
I mean, well, what do you call
someone you worship

13:47.458 --> 13:50.041
and ultimately wanna be exactly like?

13:50.041 --> 13:52.875
Me. You should wanna be like me.

13:52.875 --> 13:54.583
Well, it seems Montel has spoken.

13:54.583 --> 13:59.541
I am their idol, and they want you
and their idol, which is me, to get along.

13:59.541 --> 14:01.875
- So what do you say?
- I say...

14:01.875 --> 14:04.916
Fuck your yogurt, shitty wizard bitch.

14:04.916 --> 14:07.125
Very mature, Dad.

14:07.125 --> 14:09.625
- Now, Maury--
- Don't "Now, Maury" me.

14:09.625 --> 14:11.833
He thinks I want
his stupid apology yogurt?

14:11.833 --> 14:15.000
Is it possible
this isn't about the yogurt at all,

14:15.000 --> 14:17.625
but really about Lionel
stealing your child?

14:17.625 --> 14:21.000
You sound so fucking stupid
right now, Connie.

14:21.000 --> 14:21.916
Okay.

14:21.916 --> 14:23.833
This is about my yogurt,

14:23.833 --> 14:27.625
and giving an old man
a big fat bone-dog, okay?

14:27.625 --> 14:29.375
Fucking Lionel!

14:29.375 --> 14:32.083
Yes, Simon, you can adjust the thermostat.

14:32.083 --> 14:34.041
Sixty-nine degrees is fine.

14:34.041 --> 14:36.416
Yes, I get it.

14:36.416 --> 14:38.333
- I, uh, I gotta go.
- <i>Walter, my l--</i>

14:38.333 --> 14:40.166
Hey, Grace, what's up?

14:40.166 --> 14:43.083
I'm here for Simon's recommendation
for his transfer.

14:43.083 --> 14:45.833
But if it's a bad time,
we still have to do it.

14:45.833 --> 14:48.666
Yes, of course. His transfer.

14:48.666 --> 14:51.041
This is really just a formality,

14:51.041 --> 14:54.333
so just give me your A-okay,
and I'll stamp the paperwork.

14:54.333 --> 14:56.041
My A-okay?

14:56.041 --> 15:00.250
We'll be together always. Cringe.
At home and at work. Cringe.

15:00.250 --> 15:03.791
Your days of reality television
are over. Cringe.

15:03.791 --> 15:05.333
Cringe! Cringe!

15:05.333 --> 15:06.500
He's an embezzler.

15:06.500 --> 15:07.625
An embezzler?

15:07.625 --> 15:13.250
Yes. A thief. A stealer. He steals.
Company money specifically.

15:13.250 --> 15:14.541
- And then he hides it.
- Really?

15:14.541 --> 15:17.541
In his defense,
it is to pay for needle drugs.

15:17.541 --> 15:18.458
Jesus!

15:18.458 --> 15:22.583
- So, do you need anything else?
- No, I don't think so.

15:22.583 --> 15:25.791
Well, arson too, if you need it.

15:27.625 --> 15:28.791
Jesus, Sarah,

15:28.791 --> 15:31.916
why'd you bury these memories so deep?

15:31.916 --> 15:33.291
Ooh!

15:33.291 --> 15:37.083
Me thinks
me found me buried treasure.

15:40.625 --> 15:42.000
Wait, wait, wait! Whoa.

15:42.000 --> 15:43.041
Make a wish.

15:43.041 --> 15:45.250
Oh! That must be the mom.

15:45.250 --> 15:46.958
Shh. Don't tell your dad.

15:46.958 --> 15:48.166
Best mom ever.

15:48.166 --> 15:50.916
- Where do I look? Cheese.
- Mom, no, just smile.

15:52.333 --> 15:53.916
We look ridiculous.

15:53.916 --> 15:56.000
What's Sarah's problem with her?

15:56.000 --> 16:00.958
The doctor says, with chemo and radiation,
I should make a full recovery.

16:00.958 --> 16:02.041
Okay. Promise?

16:02.041 --> 16:03.833
Hun, we gotta trust the doctor.

16:03.833 --> 16:06.500
She's right.
I've got a good feeling about this.

16:06.500 --> 16:08.333
Oh no. I kinda don't.

16:08.333 --> 16:11.000
<i>Yeah, we're gonna try
another kind of chemo,</i>

16:11.000 --> 16:13.500
<i>and they feel really hopeful about it.</i>

16:13.500 --> 16:15.083
Well, that's-- that's good.

16:15.083 --> 16:17.125
And I'm sorry work's been so crazy,

16:17.125 --> 16:20.458
but I'm-- I'm gonna take the train up
and I'm-- I'll see you soon, okay?

16:20.458 --> 16:21.458
I-I promise.

16:21.458 --> 16:23.000
Fuck work, see her now.

16:23.000 --> 16:26.875
I just, uh... I don't wanna see my mom
in a hospital bed.

16:26.875 --> 16:29.125
No, no, you have to go in.

16:29.125 --> 16:31.208
Like with the tubes and everything.

16:31.208 --> 16:33.416
Hey, she wouldn't want you
to see her like that.

16:33.416 --> 16:35.583
Yeah, it's okay.
She'll be home in a couple of weeks.

16:35.583 --> 16:36.625
No, Sarah.

16:36.625 --> 16:39.791
Exactly. You don't have to put yourself
through that right now.

16:39.791 --> 16:42.666
- You'll see her when she's home.
- Wait. Don't leave!

16:44.125 --> 16:45.458
Hey, Dad.

16:45.458 --> 16:47.166
Um, yeah, can I call you back?

16:47.750 --> 16:51.041
What? No. No, no, no, that's not possible.

16:51.041 --> 16:53.333
No, she was supposed
to come home next week.

16:53.333 --> 16:55.666
- Fuck.
- No, no, no, no, no.

16:55.666 --> 16:57.375
No. What are you talking about?

16:57.375 --> 16:58.458
Mmm.

16:58.458 --> 17:00.583
I am so sorry, baby.

17:01.583 --> 17:03.583
Whoa! Ow!

17:05.458 --> 17:07.083
Oh my God, Sarah.

17:07.791 --> 17:10.000
You never got to say goodbye.

17:14.000 --> 17:16.708
Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Why am I so nervous?

17:16.708 --> 17:18.875
It's just eating dinner.
I do this every night.

17:18.875 --> 17:22.791
Yeah, but it's not every night
you have Sexy Stranger for dessert.

17:22.791 --> 17:25.750
Paul, I don't want to alarm you,
but if you get another boner in here,

17:25.750 --> 17:27.458
you will get MeToo'd,

17:27.458 --> 17:29.625
and you're too old to start jail.

17:29.625 --> 17:33.083
Oh my God, you're right.
I-I don't think I can do this.

17:33.083 --> 17:35.708
Nor should you. Don't you agree, Evelyn?

17:35.708 --> 17:38.666
Who, me?
His dead wife who he forgot?

17:38.666 --> 17:41.791
I'd rather he not have gross sex
with a stranger.

17:41.791 --> 17:43.458
Paul, don't listen to them. I--

17:43.458 --> 17:45.291
I know that kid.
That's-- That's not Evelyn.

17:45.291 --> 17:46.833
Uh, Walter, what do you think?

17:46.833 --> 17:52.250
Um, well, I think sometimes it's
completely okay to bail on a situation,

17:52.250 --> 17:55.666
even if you have to make up
outrageous lies to, um, do so.

17:55.666 --> 17:57.958
- Yeah. You're right. I should bail.
- Let's bail.

17:57.958 --> 18:00.625
Bailing feels good right now. Let's go.

18:00.625 --> 18:02.583
- Paul? Is that you?
- Oh, shit!

18:02.583 --> 18:05.125
- She's here! She's here!
- Um...

18:05.125 --> 18:06.625
- Deb?
- Were you just leaving?

18:06.625 --> 18:10.583
No, no, I-I was just stretching my back.

18:10.583 --> 18:11.958
Okay.

18:11.958 --> 18:14.375
I should probably stretch my back too.

18:14.375 --> 18:16.125
Oh, wait. I'm dead.

18:17.208 --> 18:19.833
- Uh, hey, guys.
- Oh, hi, Emmy.

18:19.833 --> 18:22.166
Are you here
for some more true-love bullshit?

18:22.166 --> 18:27.000
No, uh, actually,
I-I just came to say I understand.

18:27.000 --> 18:30.291
Sarah, I dug a hole in your brain,
and I get it now.

18:30.291 --> 18:33.625
- What are you talking about?
- I found out about your mom.

18:33.625 --> 18:36.166
- Ugh.
- That must've been so horrible.

18:36.166 --> 18:39.000
Of course it was horrible.
She was my best friend.

18:39.000 --> 18:42.375
No, don't listen to her, Sarah.
She's just trying to make you feel shitty.

18:42.375 --> 18:45.250
- You know what? Let's just get outta here.
- Wait, no!

18:45.250 --> 18:47.083
I-I'm just trying to help.

18:47.083 --> 18:49.416
- Hi. I'm Paul.
- Well, hi.

18:49.416 --> 18:52.250
- Welcome to dinner.
- Nice to vigorously shake your hand.

18:52.250 --> 18:56.083
Ooh! A handshake, the doorknob to sex.

18:56.083 --> 18:58.541
Please rest your thighs.

18:58.541 --> 19:01.500
Yeah, sure.
That's how humans talk.

19:01.500 --> 19:04.541
Okay, okay. A little host, I see.

19:04.541 --> 19:08.166
So, you are a woman
in the world.

19:08.166 --> 19:11.125
This date is bad.
You're a bad dater, Paul.

19:11.125 --> 19:13.625
Shit. Maybe--
Maybe we should've rehearsed this?

19:13.625 --> 19:17.250
I am a woman in the world,
and you're a man,

19:17.250 --> 19:21.041
but that's about all I know
since your profile was so mysterious.

19:21.041 --> 19:25.083
Ooh, you're a mystery, Paul.
Tell her your balls are a clue.

19:25.083 --> 19:28.208
Don't talk about your balls.
Ball talk is a one-way ticket to jail.

19:28.208 --> 19:29.791
Okay, everyone quiet!

19:29.791 --> 19:32.791
I'm sorry.
I'm a little nervous.

19:32.791 --> 19:35.125
I-I don't really know what to say.

19:35.125 --> 19:39.916
This is my, uh, first first date
in 40 years.

19:39.916 --> 19:42.791
- Oh, Big Daddy Paul, I get it.
- Wait. You do?

19:42.791 --> 19:44.291
- Of course.
- Really?

19:44.291 --> 19:46.916
I was so nervous on my first first date,

19:46.916 --> 19:50.666
I ended up showing the guy pictures
from my husband Robert's funeral.

19:50.666 --> 19:52.791
That's a relief!

19:52.791 --> 19:55.000
You know,
I've actually been trying really hard

19:55.000 --> 19:57.875
not to say my dead wife's name
since you got here.

19:57.875 --> 20:01.291
- Paul, you wanna say it real quick?
- I do. It's Evelyn. Thank you.

20:01.291 --> 20:03.041
Feels good, huh?

20:03.041 --> 20:05.416
Okay, this is actually very sweet.

20:05.416 --> 20:09.375
Now, order the meatballs,
so you can see how wide her mouth goes.

20:09.375 --> 20:11.125
Sarah, please stop.

20:11.125 --> 20:13.041
I-- I know you're sad about your mom.

20:13.041 --> 20:15.166
Shut up!

20:15.166 --> 20:17.375
What the fuck?
You're throwing rocks at me now?

20:17.375 --> 20:18.708
You're so immature.

20:18.708 --> 20:19.833
Just go away.

20:19.833 --> 20:22.166
No, Sarah needs me.
She needs her Lovebug.

20:22.166 --> 20:23.375
- Ugh. Move!
- No!

20:23.375 --> 20:24.375
- Move!
- No!

20:24.375 --> 20:25.625
- Sarah!
- Tell her to stop.

20:25.625 --> 20:27.750
No, tell <i>her</i> to stop.

20:27.750 --> 20:29.541
What the fuck?

20:30.625 --> 20:34.875
To Robert and Evelyn.
May they not smite us from heaven.

20:34.875 --> 20:37.416
Evelyn might be, but Robert?
I don't know if Robert's in heaven.

20:38.750 --> 20:39.916
- Dad?
- Sarah.

20:39.916 --> 20:40.958
- Wait.
- Sweetie.

20:40.958 --> 20:42.291
That's her dad?

20:42.291 --> 20:46.041
Yeah.
His dead wife is her dead mom.

20:46.041 --> 20:48.125
Does nobody read the files?

20:48.125 --> 20:50.958
Hi. What-- What, uh...
What are you doing here?

20:50.958 --> 20:53.125
What am <i>I</i> doing here?
What are <i>you</i> doing here?

20:53.125 --> 20:56.333
Uh, well, I'm kind of, uh, on-- on a date.

20:56.333 --> 20:59.125
Oh, a date! Cool.

20:59.125 --> 21:02.958
Yeah, this is Deb.
Uh, I met her on the Internet.

21:02.958 --> 21:06.083
- Well, that's fucking gross.
- Oh, no she didn't!

21:06.083 --> 21:07.958
I actually think she did.

21:07.958 --> 21:09.250
I'm sorry, Internet lady.

21:09.250 --> 21:12.000
I'm sure you're probably... very nice,

21:12.000 --> 21:14.541
but, Dad, how could you do this to Mom?

21:14.541 --> 21:16.416
- Sarah.
- I thought your wife was dead.

21:16.416 --> 21:19.291
She is, right? I've been duped before,
I will not be duped again.

21:19.291 --> 21:21.833
I'm sorry, Deb. I-- I gotta handle this.

21:21.833 --> 21:23.333
Yeah, sure.

21:23.333 --> 21:26.458
Your profile didn't say
you had kids either.

21:26.958 --> 21:29.833
- I can't believe-- I can't believe him.
- Sarah, please stop.

21:29.833 --> 21:33.208
Ple-- Honey, it was never my intention
to hurt you.

21:33.208 --> 21:36.708
Hurt? I'm not hurt, Dad. I'm pissed.
Mom just died.

21:36.708 --> 21:39.541
Oh, sweetie, it's been almost a year.

21:39.541 --> 21:42.000
And I miss her every day.

21:42.000 --> 21:43.666
- I miss you too.
- Don't do that.

21:43.666 --> 21:47.250
Now I call you and text you all the time,
but you never respond.

21:47.250 --> 21:49.333
And, you know, I get it. I get it.

21:49.333 --> 21:52.458
You feel bad about everything with Mom.

21:52.458 --> 21:53.416
Please, just stop.

21:53.416 --> 21:56.875
No, no, your mom knew
you wanted to be there, kiddo.

21:56.875 --> 21:59.000
I don't wanna talk about it, okay?

21:59.000 --> 22:01.208
So good for you. You're moving on.

22:01.208 --> 22:03.000
Have fun with your sexy new life.

22:03.000 --> 22:05.083
- Uh, no. Sarah, please.
- Bye, Dad.

22:05.083 --> 22:07.708
- Nice work, Sarah.
- What? No, it wasn't.

22:07.708 --> 22:09.333
Hey, Paul.

22:09.333 --> 22:11.583
This is a lot for a first date,

22:11.583 --> 22:14.875
so I gots to go,
and we gots to go Dutch.

22:14.875 --> 22:17.250
Uh, yeah, yeah, okay. Sure.

22:17.250 --> 22:19.125
Ain't no man
just gonna leave me with the bill.

22:19.125 --> 22:21.666
Nuh-uh, not this time.
I joke, but I don't play.

22:21.666 --> 22:24.125
Not me, Mr. Tall Tennis Man.

22:24.125 --> 22:27.750
Sarah, go back and talk to him.
He's your dad. He loves you.

22:27.750 --> 22:29.166
Don't listen to her.

22:29.166 --> 22:32.791
She was wrong about Ben,
she snuck her way into your memories--

22:32.791 --> 22:35.833
Only because you guys
wouldn't tell me about her mom.

22:35.833 --> 22:37.375
Stop talking about her.

22:37.375 --> 22:39.041
See? She's a shitty Lovebug.

22:39.041 --> 22:42.958
Okay, yeah,
I am a shitty Lovebug sometimes.

22:42.958 --> 22:46.416
But I am good enough to know
that you really loved your mom.

22:46.416 --> 22:49.166
- Jesus! She did it again.
- Sarah, please.

22:49.166 --> 22:51.333
Just stay away from me, Emmy.
Okay? I'm done.

22:51.333 --> 22:52.916
Done? What does that mean?

22:52.916 --> 22:54.750
It means you're fired.

22:54.750 --> 22:58.291
- What? You can't do that.
- Honey, I think she just did.

22:58.291 --> 22:59.666
But you need me.

22:59.666 --> 23:03.291
Oh, everything's a mess!

23:03.291 --> 23:07.083
This is what happens
when you let people get too close.

23:07.083 --> 23:08.250
- Uh...
- Sorry.

23:08.250 --> 23:10.250
I'm going through
some personal stuff.

23:12.833 --> 23:14.833
- Maurice?
- Oh, hello, Lionel.

23:14.833 --> 23:16.833
What are you doing in my office?

23:16.833 --> 23:20.708
I realize I may have overreacted
a little bit about the yogurt.

23:20.708 --> 23:24.208
- Yeah, I'll say.
- And while you may be Montel's mentor--

23:24.208 --> 23:25.875
- Idol. Thank you.
- Whatever.

23:25.875 --> 23:30.041
I will always be their father,
and you cannot take that away from me.

23:30.041 --> 23:31.583
Yes, well, if you say so.

23:31.583 --> 23:34.625
- And so, I am sorry.
- Oh!

23:34.625 --> 23:37.958
Well, that's very, uh...
that's very mature of you, Maurice.

23:37.958 --> 23:39.875
Yes, well, I'm very mature.

23:39.875 --> 23:42.833
And now, out of respect,
I shall back out of your office,

23:42.833 --> 23:45.916
never showing my rear,
clenching ever so tightly.

23:45.916 --> 23:47.333
Uh, hang on, Maurice.

23:47.333 --> 23:50.250
One of my Nazi dildos seems to be missing.

23:50.250 --> 23:51.291
Oh?

23:51.291 --> 23:54.750
Yes, Adolf Tickler, I believe.
Di-- Did you--

23:54.750 --> 23:58.250
What? Steal your favorite dildo
and stick it up my ass?

23:58.250 --> 23:59.166
Yes.

23:59.166 --> 24:02.375
And then offer you a fake apology
with said dildo still in my ass?

24:02.375 --> 24:03.666
- Precisely.
- And then, what?

24:03.666 --> 24:08.666
Uh, proceed to walk out ass-backwards,
leaving you none the wiser?

24:08.666 --> 24:11.708
I am the wiser.
You obviously did all of that.

24:11.708 --> 24:15.125
Anyway, it's getting late,
so toodle-oo. Gotta go.

24:15.125 --> 24:16.583
Oh, very good.

24:16.583 --> 24:20.416
Maurice, those are purely decorative,
for display only!

24:21.416 --> 24:23.000
It's worth nothing now.

24:24.166 --> 24:27.166
Honey... [sighs] ...I'm home.

24:27.166 --> 24:30.666
- Walter, we need to talk.
- Oh, um, okay.

24:30.666 --> 24:34.000
So I just spoke with Grace,
and, apparently,

24:34.000 --> 24:36.958
you gave me a very weird recommendation.

24:36.958 --> 24:40.125
What? No. You are so random.

24:40.125 --> 24:42.000
Now, I may be cuckoo bananas,

24:42.000 --> 24:44.791
but it seems like
you don't really want me here.

24:44.791 --> 24:47.000
Oh, sweetie, that's not it.

24:47.000 --> 24:51.541
It's just that I worry
if you stay, I'm going to kill you.

24:51.541 --> 24:55.708
Okay, but I don't wanna be with someone
who wants to murder me.

24:55.708 --> 24:58.958
Not again, at least.
It's a very stressful kink.

24:58.958 --> 25:01.708
Well, if it helps,
I don't <i>want</i> to kill you.

25:01.708 --> 25:05.916
But having you all up in my space
makes me, uh... cringe?

25:05.916 --> 25:07.083
Am I using it right?

25:07.083 --> 25:08.333
- You're not.
- Shit.

25:08.333 --> 25:11.916
I'm just confused, Walter, because
I thought this was what you wanted.

25:11.916 --> 25:13.541
I thought so too.

25:13.541 --> 25:17.833
I guess it's easier for me
to do intimacy 48 hours at a time.

25:17.833 --> 25:22.208
You gotta let people in, Walter.
And not just on the weekends.

25:22.208 --> 25:26.750
I know, but, for now, can we just go back
to the way things were?

25:26.750 --> 25:28.708
I'm sorry. I can't.

25:28.708 --> 25:32.125
I only go backwards
if I'm hiding a dildo up my ass.

25:32.125 --> 25:34.125
Yeah. That makes sense.

25:34.125 --> 25:36.958
And again, I'm sorry about all the pubies.

25:36.958 --> 25:39.000
I'm not used to cleaning up after myself.

25:39.000 --> 25:41.958
- Usually my butler does all that.
- I'm sorry. Your butler?

25:41.958 --> 25:44.791
Oh, Walter, it's number eight,
my favorite chopper.

25:44.791 --> 25:46.625
My pilot is so nice.

25:46.625 --> 25:48.541
Your pilot? Hold up.

25:48.541 --> 25:50.333
Wait, wait, wait. [chuckles] You rich?

25:50.333 --> 25:53.041
I'm gonna miss that noggin!
