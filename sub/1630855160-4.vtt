WEBVTT

00:06.340 --> 00:08.660
is this complex web
of offshore shell companies.

00:08.660 --> 00:10.620
Looks like a classic effort
to evade tax.

00:10.620 --> 00:12.340
If Sophie were threatening
to expose him...

00:12.340 --> 00:14.460
Then you've got a motive for murder.

00:14.460 --> 00:17.020
I need you here to make sure
the sale of Winston Station
goes through.

00:17.020 --> 00:18.380
Well, I'm doing all I can.

00:18.380 --> 00:20.660
Oh, that company structure
that you set up for me?

00:20.660 --> 00:23.220
I don't want you to worry, but the
police have been sniffing around.

00:23.220 --> 00:25.660
I think I put them off the scent.

00:25.660 --> 00:27.260
I was in love with you.

00:27.260 --> 00:28.900
I still am.

00:28.900 --> 00:30.620
I never stopped loving you.

00:30.620 --> 00:32.100
You look hot.

00:32.100 --> 00:33.780
I thought I might wear it
to the Boab Ball.

00:33.780 --> 00:35.220
Oh, hell yeah!

00:35.220 --> 00:36.380
Ooh. Oh.

00:36.380 --> 00:38.060
Sorry.

00:38.060 --> 00:39.740
We need to find her.

00:39.740 --> 00:40.860
Is this Erica?

00:40.860 --> 00:43.180
I'm meeting her. In an hour.

00:43.180 --> 00:45.020
Same deal - I go alone.

00:45.020 --> 00:46.660
Max, no.

00:46.660 --> 00:47.660
(SIREN CHIRPS)

00:49.300 --> 00:50.460
Stay where you are.

00:50.460 --> 00:53.820
Erica Peyton, I'm arresting you
for the supply of a prohibited drug.

00:53.820 --> 00:55.540
What the fuck are you doing?

00:55.540 --> 00:57.100
What you should have.

01:18.300 --> 01:20.540
Sir, I wish to make
a formal complaint

01:20.540 --> 01:22.460
about the behaviour of DS Driscoll.

01:22.460 --> 01:25.460
She knew I had an agreement
with the witness.

01:28.300 --> 01:32.500
You need to understand that DS
Driscoll is under a lot of pressure,

01:32.500 --> 01:34.660
mainly coming from me.

01:34.660 --> 01:36.300
We need a breakthrough,

01:36.300 --> 01:38.780
and this young woman
might just give us it.

01:38.780 --> 01:40.700
I was going to question her.

01:40.700 --> 01:44.140
You do recall you don't have
any jurisdiction here?

01:44.140 --> 01:47.780
That's why she was prepared
to speak to me.

01:47.780 --> 01:50.900
DRISCOLL: You can choose to have
legal representation if you wish.

01:50.900 --> 01:52.580
ERICA: How am I going to afford
a lawyer?

01:52.580 --> 01:54.860
Maybe out of the 20K
you stole from Sophie.

01:54.860 --> 01:56.220
Makes a good point.

01:56.220 --> 01:58.300
(SCOFFS) She said I could borrow it.

01:58.300 --> 02:00.220
She was dead.

02:00.220 --> 02:01.700
Look, I'm not going to say anything.

02:01.700 --> 02:03.380
I shouldn't even be here.

02:03.380 --> 02:05.900
That Pommy cop gave me his word
that I wouldn't be arrested.

02:05.900 --> 02:08.500
Well, it wasn't his word to give.

02:08.500 --> 02:09.500
So...

02:10.540 --> 02:12.460
..tell us about the 20 grand.

02:16.980 --> 02:18.820
Look, you're not going to do
yourself any favours

02:18.820 --> 02:20.300
by not cooperating, Erica.

02:24.900 --> 02:28.300
She'd be willing to cooperate
if you hadn't made deals with her.

02:28.300 --> 02:31.020
That deal got us Sophie's laptop,
remember?

02:31.020 --> 02:32.460
And a fat lot of good that did us.

02:32.460 --> 02:33.740
OK, stop.

02:33.740 --> 02:35.980
We are on the same team, remember?

02:35.980 --> 02:37.180
I know that.

02:37.180 --> 02:38.180
(SCOFFS)

02:38.180 --> 02:40.980
OK, any more of that and you'll
both be in the naughty corner.

02:42.180 --> 02:43.340
Right.

02:43.340 --> 02:45.220
Question is, how best to get Erica

02:45.220 --> 02:47.980
to give up what she knows
about Sophie's murder?

02:47.980 --> 02:50.140
Charge her -
possession and supply of drugs.

02:50.140 --> 02:51.940
Use that as leverage.

02:51.940 --> 02:53.860
We don't have enough
to make any charges stick.

02:53.860 --> 02:56.900
She doesn't know that.
Might be enough to rattle her cage.

02:56.900 --> 02:59.020
Let's keep that as our backup.

02:59.020 --> 03:01.260
Now, you say
she was willing to talk to you?

03:01.260 --> 03:02.900
She was.

03:02.900 --> 03:05.340
Now she thinks I betrayed her.

03:05.340 --> 03:08.020
Still, might be worth a try.

03:09.140 --> 03:11.980
Sir, DS Drummond
is not part of the investigation.

03:11.980 --> 03:13.820
Just making a suggestion, Meg.

03:13.820 --> 03:15.380
It's your case.

03:15.380 --> 03:16.580
It's your call.

03:25.500 --> 03:28.460
They seriously think
I'm going to talk to you?

03:28.460 --> 03:30.620
No, they don't.

03:32.260 --> 03:33.780
But I thought you might.

03:33.780 --> 03:35.740
(SNIGGERS) Think again, dumbass.

03:36.900 --> 03:38.820
I let you down, Erica.

03:38.820 --> 03:40.380
I didn't keep my end of the bargain.

03:40.380 --> 03:44.860
I wanted to,
but somebody didn't let me.

03:44.860 --> 03:47.060
And I'm supposed to trust you now?

03:47.060 --> 03:49.420
I'd understand why you wouldn't.

03:52.020 --> 03:54.780
The police may threaten you
with a drugs charge,

03:54.780 --> 03:58.060
but they don't have enough evidence
to get a conviction.

04:00.260 --> 04:02.180
But they can go looking for evidence,

04:02.180 --> 04:04.860
and we both know that shouldn't be
very hard to come by.

04:06.020 --> 04:08.460
This is a murder investigation,

04:08.460 --> 04:11.100
and that's what I'm interested in...

04:12.180 --> 04:13.900
..finding Sophie's killer.

04:16.140 --> 04:19.340
And the fact that you were flogging
a few pills on a party boat...

04:19.340 --> 04:21.740
I only care about that to the extent
that it's got anything to do

04:21.740 --> 04:23.060
with her death.

04:23.060 --> 04:24.780
It doesn't.

04:24.780 --> 04:27.300
I've given you the laptop.
That's what this is about.

04:27.300 --> 04:29.300
We're still investigating
the laptop.

04:30.300 --> 04:33.140
We just need to explore all avenues.

04:35.980 --> 04:37.820
The pills on the boat, I mean,

04:37.820 --> 04:39.820
they are not why she was killed.

04:39.820 --> 04:41.540
I mean, you're talking handfuls...

04:41.540 --> 04:43.380
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

04:43.380 --> 04:45.540
I just told you
they don't have enough evidence.

04:45.540 --> 04:47.540
Don't give them any more.

04:47.540 --> 04:52.260
Look, whoever was selling pills,
right, they're small fry.

04:53.620 --> 04:55.260
And so is the guy above them.

04:55.260 --> 04:59.660
But he's the next rung on the ladder,
so we do need to speak to him.

05:00.820 --> 05:03.660
I've got a pretty good idea
who that is.

05:05.340 --> 05:07.460
I just need you to confirm it.

05:22.540 --> 05:24.660
I can say I've had my picture taken
with the next prime minister.

05:24.660 --> 05:26.340
Oh! Well, I hope so.

05:26.340 --> 05:28.300
Thank you so much.
Not a problem.

05:29.340 --> 05:30.700
Sorry.

05:30.700 --> 05:33.740
You say no once, and the media
call you aloof and unapproachable.

05:33.740 --> 05:37.420
And the voters care more about that
than your policy on health care?

05:40.180 --> 05:42.220
What?
Nothing.

05:43.420 --> 05:46.100
I was thinking about
what might have been...

05:46.100 --> 05:47.660
If we'd got together?

05:47.660 --> 05:50.780
Maybe we'd be a power couple,
like the Clintons.

05:50.780 --> 05:54.260
Except he won, and she lost.

05:54.260 --> 05:56.980
Well, I'm glad
you're staying a little longer.

05:56.980 --> 05:58.700
I can relax with you.

05:58.700 --> 06:00.060
You're in the midst of an election.

06:00.060 --> 06:02.260
You shouldn't be relaxing.

06:02.260 --> 06:03.260
True.

06:06.900 --> 06:09.620
One lunch, we can explain away.

06:09.620 --> 06:12.900
Any more, and that in itself
will become a story.

06:12.900 --> 06:13.980
Then have dinner with me.

06:13.980 --> 06:16.260
As stupid ideas go,
that beats Brexit.

06:16.260 --> 06:17.700
Not in public.

06:17.700 --> 06:21.220
Your hotel has room service,
doesn't it?

06:24.500 --> 06:27.460
Greg, any chance
of a photo with you, mate?

06:28.940 --> 06:29.940
Of course.

06:31.060 --> 06:32.740
Thanks.
Not a problem.

06:32.740 --> 06:34.620
Who's this little man?
Ha.

06:42.180 --> 06:43.420
Oi!

06:44.940 --> 06:46.820
Oscar Aruzzi, I'm arresting you

06:46.820 --> 06:49.180
on suspicion of the supply
of a class A drug.

06:49.180 --> 06:51.380
What?
We require you
to come to the station.

06:51.380 --> 06:52.540
I want a lawyer.

06:54.380 --> 06:55.780
You got one on speed dial?

06:55.780 --> 06:58.020
Oh, mate, I'm getting arrested.
Some bullshit about drugs...

06:58.020 --> 07:00.100
Alright, I'll be taking that.
Can you get me a lawyer?

07:00.100 --> 07:01.380
Not without a warrant.

07:06.460 --> 07:08.140
Alright, mate, let's go.

07:08.140 --> 07:09.540
Come on.

07:09.540 --> 07:11.500
Damo, can you finish the cutting,
mate?

07:12.940 --> 07:14.580
You missed a bit, Damo.

07:21.940 --> 07:24.780
What time
do you think you'll be back?

07:24.780 --> 07:26.380
Christ knows.

07:26.380 --> 07:29.380
Lloyd says they're going to want
to go to the casino after dinner.

07:29.380 --> 07:31.180
My idea of hell.

07:31.180 --> 07:34.020
So, later than midnight, you think?

07:34.020 --> 07:35.420
More like dawn.

07:35.420 --> 07:36.420
Oh.

07:41.100 --> 07:44.820
Sarge, I've downloaded the photos
from Oscar's phone.

07:44.820 --> 07:46.820
You might want
to take a look at this.

07:48.220 --> 07:49.260
Jesus.

07:49.260 --> 07:50.500
What is that?

07:51.780 --> 07:52.900
Oh, sorry.

07:52.900 --> 07:55.180
I didn't recognise it out of context.

07:55.180 --> 07:57.620
What do you call a female dick pick?

07:57.620 --> 07:58.940
Snatch shot?

07:58.940 --> 08:00.100
(LAUGHTER)

08:00.100 --> 08:02.140
Oh, come on. That wasn't bad.

08:02.140 --> 08:03.940
Can we tell whether it's Erica?

08:03.940 --> 08:05.060
It isn't.

08:08.220 --> 08:09.220
Sophie.

08:09.220 --> 08:13.100
She sent these to Oscar's phone
a week before she was murdered.

08:18.900 --> 08:20.660
Steph, I've got this.

08:21.980 --> 08:23.500
We just need a quick word.

08:23.500 --> 08:24.500
Won't take long.

08:24.500 --> 08:26.740
Why don't you show us to a table?

08:29.860 --> 08:31.220
Try to be discreet.

08:35.020 --> 08:37.660
Were Sophie and Oscar
sleeping together?

08:37.660 --> 08:39.260
They were sexting each other.

08:39.260 --> 08:40.260
Bullshit.

08:44.700 --> 08:46.820
You might want to be discreet too.

08:47.980 --> 08:50.500
These pictures
were sent to Oscar's phone.

08:50.500 --> 08:52.780
Sophie sent them.

08:52.780 --> 08:54.500
Seriously?

08:57.260 --> 08:58.260
Shit.

09:04.860 --> 09:06.620
You bastard, Oscar!

09:06.620 --> 09:07.740
I knew you two were at it.

09:07.740 --> 09:10.900
You can absolutely get fucked.
Do you hear me?

09:11.980 --> 09:14.580
We actually have Oscar's phone.

09:19.340 --> 09:20.940
You know, uh...

09:20.940 --> 09:24.380
You know Sophie went back to Tom's
dad's house the night she died?

09:24.380 --> 09:25.940
What?

09:25.940 --> 09:27.220
Check Oscar's phone.

09:27.220 --> 09:29.860
It'll show a call to me
around 11:30.

09:29.860 --> 09:32.500
That was Sophie
letting me know where she was.

09:32.500 --> 09:34.020
She couldn't use her own phone...

09:34.020 --> 09:36.700
Because she dropped it off the boat
during the party.

09:37.820 --> 09:39.580
Tom threw it overboard.

09:40.620 --> 09:42.220
Why have you kept this to yourself?

09:42.220 --> 09:44.220
Because Oscar begged me to.

09:44.220 --> 09:46.780
He thought that if you knew
she went back to the house,

09:46.780 --> 09:48.620
it might make him and Tom
look guilty.

09:48.620 --> 09:51.620
Well, he was right about that.

09:58.680 --> 10:00.280
I'm expecting a call from the PM.

10:00.280 --> 10:01.720
No, not at all.

10:03.760 --> 10:06.560
Shall I order us some drinks,
Minister?

10:06.560 --> 10:11.680
Oh, um...I don't think we need
to keep you two. Do you, Greg?

10:11.680 --> 10:14.920
No, no. It's probably best
we keep this briefing off the record.

10:14.920 --> 10:17.400
Why don't you and Justin
take yourselves down to the bar,

10:17.400 --> 10:19.000
get to know one another?

10:22.560 --> 10:23.560
Sure.

10:30.200 --> 10:33.320
What do you think
they're doing up there?

10:33.320 --> 10:35.400
I hope it's nothing substantive...

10:35.400 --> 10:37.200
..without officials present.

10:37.200 --> 10:39.040
That would be quite inappropriate.

10:40.120 --> 10:42.160
I'm pretty sure it's inappropriate.

10:43.840 --> 10:45.320
Nothing to do with trade.

10:45.320 --> 10:48.960
Relations of another kind,
if you know what I mean.

10:55.800 --> 10:57.760
I don't, actually.

11:00.040 --> 11:02.600
You're aware they used to be lovers?

11:03.800 --> 11:05.480
Abigail and...?

11:05.480 --> 11:06.760
No.

11:06.760 --> 11:09.360
Jesus! You're a close adviser.

11:09.360 --> 11:12.160
Well, not close in that sense.

11:12.160 --> 11:14.760
I know they used to be friends.

11:14.760 --> 11:19.480
Friends with benefits,
which I assume they've resumed.

11:19.480 --> 11:22.520
Surely they wouldn't take a risk
like that? Not now.

11:22.520 --> 11:24.840
You haven't been in this game
very long, have you?

11:27.120 --> 11:31.400
Politicians are, by their nature,
risk takers.

11:31.400 --> 11:33.800
They're drawn to it.
They're like moths to a flame.

11:33.800 --> 11:37.640
They think they can get away
with anything.

11:38.800 --> 11:40.440
Most of the time they're right.

11:43.960 --> 11:45.560
What should we do?

11:45.560 --> 11:47.120
Have another drink.

11:48.200 --> 11:50.320
And store it away for your memoirs.

11:56.360 --> 11:57.760
Sit.

11:57.760 --> 11:59.200
I'll get you some dinner.

11:59.200 --> 12:00.680
How was your day?

12:00.680 --> 12:02.560
Good. Yeah.

12:02.560 --> 12:04.640
I think we've made a breakthrough.

12:08.520 --> 12:10.480
No, I am.

12:10.480 --> 12:13.040
Is it because you don't relish
the thought of going home?

12:34.000 --> 12:36.280
Do you think
he might be having an affair?

Don't pretend
it hasn't occurred to you.

12:37.960 --> 12:41.400
Yeah, I'm a cop.
I'm naturally suspicious.

12:41.400 --> 12:43.640
I'm not sure I'd be that upset
if he was.

12:43.640 --> 12:44.800
For the boys, but...

12:47.000 --> 12:48.520

You should, too.

13:28.360 --> 13:29.800
I did save some for you,

but then you didn't tell me
when you'd be home,

13:31.480 --> 13:32.880
so I gave it to Max.

13:34.520 --> 13:36.040
Ah.
Oh, I'm sorry.

20:54.420 --> 20:56.460
You said you had something
to tell me.

20:59.300 --> 21:03.420
As you know, the sale of Winston
Station is all very hush-hush.

21:03.420 --> 21:04.980
I haven't told a soul.

21:07.060 --> 21:08.660
When it's announced,

21:08.660 --> 21:11.100
shares in Lloyd's company
will leap in value.

21:12.420 --> 21:14.220
Anticipating that,

21:14.220 --> 21:16.020
I took a position

21:16.020 --> 21:19.380
that will earn me a substantial
profit when the sale goes ahead.

21:21.340 --> 21:23.020
Isn't that insider dealing?

21:23.020 --> 21:24.300
No.

21:24.300 --> 21:27.940
Well, arguably. It's a grey area.

21:27.940 --> 21:30.300
But anyway, I've been very careful
to cover my tracks.

21:30.300 --> 21:34.100
The thing is, I thought the sale
would have gone ahead by now.

21:34.100 --> 21:37.580
And it would have if your trade deal
with Australia had been agreed.

21:37.580 --> 21:39.540
But because it hasn't,

21:39.540 --> 21:42.260
the buyers for Winston Station
are dragging their feet.

21:42.260 --> 21:44.100
And that's just a tactic, surely.

21:44.100 --> 21:45.460
Yes, they still want to buy,

21:45.460 --> 21:48.100
but they just want to drive
the price down.

21:49.500 --> 21:52.380
And with it the profit
on your questionable trading.

21:52.380 --> 21:55.780
As things stand, I'm looking
at making a significant loss.

21:57.380 --> 21:58.980
How much?

22:00.660 --> 22:03.820
Well, that depends.
How much, Simon?

22:25.980 --> 22:27.940
to save your grubby little deal?

22:31.460 --> 22:32.700
Does Lloyd know about this?

22:32.700 --> 22:33.820
Oh, God, no.

22:33.820 --> 22:36.940
Even if it's not illegal,
it's certainly unethical.

22:36.940 --> 22:38.660
Well, I can't help you.

22:38.660 --> 22:40.620
You have to.

22:41.620 --> 22:43.180
The longer
there's no trade agreement,

22:43.180 --> 22:44.620
the more the share price is falling.

22:44.620 --> 22:47.140
It's corrupt, Simon.

22:47.140 --> 22:48.660
You could go to prison.

22:48.660 --> 22:50.900
By the sounds of it, you should.

22:51.900 --> 22:55.780
This sale is going to make a fortune
for Lloyd and his mates.

22:55.780 --> 22:57.180
Why shouldn't I see some of that?

22:57.180 --> 22:58.580
Because they're smart, Simon.

That should mitigate your loss.

you sell.

And then we'll see

You just made that?

23:57.340 --> 23:58.740
Yes, sir.

Sophie had lost hers.

24:19.140 --> 24:21.020
Well, there's disputes
about that too.

24:21.020 --> 24:23.900
Tom says that Sophie dropped
her phone off the side
of the party boat.

24:23.900 --> 24:26.700
Erica says that Tom
threw her phone overboard.

24:28.260 --> 24:29.260
You're being very quiet.

24:29.260 --> 24:32.100
I'm purely an observer, sir.

24:33.820 --> 24:36.220
Oh, well, let's presume
the boys are telling the truth.

24:36.220 --> 24:38.140
What follows from that, Cindy?

24:38.140 --> 24:39.660
That Erica's lying, sir.

24:39.660 --> 24:43.060
Which would imply
that she has something to hide.

24:43.060 --> 24:44.860
Is it 'imply' or 'infer'?

24:44.860 --> 24:46.580
Imply.

24:46.580 --> 24:48.300
I thought you were an observer.

24:48.300 --> 24:50.060
I'm making an observation.

24:51.260 --> 24:53.260
Carry on, PC Yoo.

24:53.260 --> 24:58.300
Well, Erica did steal that $20,000
from Sophie's account,

24:58.300 --> 25:00.860
and we only have her word
that Sophie feared for her life

25:00.860 --> 25:02.420
because of the laptop.

25:02.420 --> 25:05.020
Well, let's presume Erica Peyton
is telling the truth.

25:06.700 --> 25:08.460
DC Hooper?

25:08.460 --> 25:12.140
Well, then, the boys
have conspired together to lie.

25:12.140 --> 25:16.820
CCTV puts them at a nightclub
between 12 and 2am.

25:16.820 --> 25:19.260
It could be that they went there
in an attempt to establish

25:19.260 --> 25:20.820
a false alibi.

25:20.820 --> 25:22.100
What would their motive be?

25:22.100 --> 25:25.060
Well, there are the compromising
photos of Sophie

25:25.060 --> 25:26.580
that she sent to Oscar's phone.

25:26.580 --> 25:28.700
You'd think Tom
wouldn't be too happy about that.

25:28.700 --> 25:30.020
Have you shown them to him?

25:30.020 --> 25:31.380
He laughed them off.

25:31.380 --> 25:34.100
Said that Sophie sent the pictures
to Oscar as a prank.

25:34.100 --> 25:37.380
In my day, a prank was putting
shaving cream in someone's shoe.

25:37.380 --> 25:39.820
Different generation, sir.

25:39.820 --> 25:43.300
Do we have any evidence that either
of the boys is capable of violence?

25:43.300 --> 25:47.700
Well, there's Erica's claim that Tom
threw Sophie's phone off the boat.

25:47.700 --> 25:50.180
There was something
one of the girls said

25:50.180 --> 25:53.140
in the first interviews you did
with guests on the party boat.

25:53.140 --> 25:54.780
Brynne Matthews.

25:56.100 --> 25:58.940
How did Sophie seem?
Was she having a good time?

25:58.940 --> 26:00.740
Yeah, Sophie.

26:00.740 --> 26:03.380
Like, who wouldn't,
if Tom was your boyfriend? (LAUGHS)

26:04.900 --> 26:07.020
Even though
he can be a bit controlling.

26:09.420 --> 26:12.460
I mean, I know controlling
isn't the same as violence...

26:12.460 --> 26:15.060
But they do go hand in hand.

26:15.060 --> 26:17.900
Mm. Sounds worth looking into.

26:17.900 --> 26:20.380
Meg, you and I
have to go face the press.

26:20.380 --> 26:22.340
What are we going to tell them, sir?

26:22.340 --> 26:24.420
That we're closing in on the killer.

26:24.420 --> 26:26.060
Do your best to make that true.

26:26.060 --> 26:27.460
Good coffee, Lachie.

26:40.660 --> 26:42.940
Ha! Weet-Bix?

26:42.940 --> 26:45.780
Is that the same as Weetabix
but without an A?

26:45.780 --> 26:48.100
No, it's similar, but different.

26:48.100 --> 26:49.820
Like a lot about Australia.

26:49.820 --> 26:51.940
Our sense of humour -
not quite English.

26:53.700 --> 26:54.980
You like it, though?

26:54.980 --> 26:56.220
Oh, I love it.

26:56.220 --> 26:57.940
And the stuff I miss.

26:57.940 --> 26:59.340
Family, of course.

26:59.340 --> 27:00.820
Old friends.

27:00.820 --> 27:02.260
Having Europe on your doorstep.

27:02.260 --> 27:04.300
We're always saying that we'll go
to Paris for the weekend,

27:04.300 --> 27:05.460
but we never do.

27:05.460 --> 27:07.060
Oh, I'd make you.
Ha!

27:07.060 --> 27:09.180
Well, you wouldn't have to.

27:11.660 --> 27:12.860
Uh...

27:12.860 --> 27:13.860
(CHUCKLES AWKWARDLY)

27:13.860 --> 27:15.660
It's not that I don't want to go
with Anna,

27:15.660 --> 27:18.300
it's just we never seem
to get around to it.

27:19.820 --> 27:21.340
Well, you should make more effort.

27:22.460 --> 27:24.420
It might help you
get out of the rut you're in.

27:24.420 --> 27:26.820
You think we're in a rut?

27:26.820 --> 27:28.740
I know what they look like.

27:30.820 --> 27:31.900
No.

27:31.900 --> 27:32.980
No!

27:32.980 --> 27:34.580
Put it back.

27:34.580 --> 27:35.820
Nice try.

27:44.300 --> 27:46.060
Thank you.

27:46.060 --> 27:48.060
I can't see any paparazzi.

27:49.740 --> 27:52.940
Perhaps my 15 minutes of fame is up.

27:52.940 --> 27:57.300
Well, it'll last a lot longer
when you become prime minister.

27:58.540 --> 28:01.420
Well, let's hope you haven't
destroyed any chance of that.

28:04.500 --> 28:05.980
Good morning, Ben.

28:05.980 --> 28:07.980
What's on the agenda for today?

28:07.980 --> 28:09.060
The police are here.

28:09.060 --> 28:10.620
They'd like a word with you both.

28:10.620 --> 28:12.180
Do they have some news?

28:12.180 --> 28:13.860
More questions, I believe.

28:15.180 --> 28:17.060
You have another round
of trade talks later.

28:17.060 --> 28:19.180
After that, we can prep
for your TV interview.

28:19.180 --> 28:21.100
Oh, I know what I'm going to say.

28:23.100 --> 28:24.820
Are you going to Lloyd's do?

28:25.900 --> 28:27.540
You're not thinking you will?

28:27.540 --> 28:28.580
No.

28:28.580 --> 28:30.460
I'm still grieving my daughter.

28:30.460 --> 28:32.220
I am, too.

28:32.220 --> 28:34.500
No-one will think it amiss
if I don't go.

28:35.580 --> 28:37.420
I think you should.

28:37.420 --> 28:42.260
I know it's for charity, but the talk
will be all business, won't it?

28:42.260 --> 28:46.060
Lloyd told me that prospective
buyers for Winston Station
will be there.

28:47.420 --> 28:49.900
If you don't think
it would reflect badly on you.

28:49.900 --> 28:51.380
(SCOFFS)

28:51.380 --> 28:53.100
Don't give a thought to me.

28:53.100 --> 28:55.620
No, you go.

28:58.260 --> 29:01.540
I really should brief Greg Hardy
on the trade talks.

29:01.540 --> 29:04.340
See if he's free to meet me
after my TV interview.

29:05.420 --> 29:06.820
I'll book a restaurant for you.

29:06.820 --> 29:08.860
No, at this stage of the election,

29:08.860 --> 29:11.180
we shouldn't be seen together
in public.

29:11.180 --> 29:12.580
I'll meet him here.

29:12.580 --> 29:14.060
You can bring him to our room.

29:15.260 --> 29:16.260
Right.

29:17.260 --> 29:19.740
Let's not keep the police
waiting any longer.

29:23.100 --> 29:26.180
How would you describe
Sophie's relationship with Tom?

29:26.180 --> 29:27.900
You're looking at Tom now?

29:27.900 --> 29:30.820
At this stage,
we're looking at everybody.

29:30.820 --> 29:33.580
How long have they been together?

29:33.580 --> 29:34.940
Over a year.

29:34.940 --> 29:36.460
Any rocky moments?

29:36.460 --> 29:37.900
No.

29:37.900 --> 29:40.260
Well, not that we were aware of.

29:40.260 --> 29:42.100
I'm not sure she would have told us.

29:43.380 --> 29:45.940
They always seemed very loving.

29:45.940 --> 29:47.180
They were in love.

29:47.180 --> 29:49.300
Yeah, but there must have been
disagreements

29:49.300 --> 29:51.460
if they were going out
for more than a year.

29:53.620 --> 29:56.340
There was that time in London.

29:56.340 --> 29:57.540
I don't remember.

29:58.540 --> 30:00.460
They'd been to some party.

30:00.460 --> 30:03.820
Tom was very quiet the next day,
Sophie said he was sulking,

30:03.820 --> 30:06.980
thought she'd been flirting
with the DJ or something.

30:06.980 --> 30:09.860
So he could be jealous, possessive?

30:09.860 --> 30:12.380
No, I wouldn't go that far.

30:12.380 --> 30:15.140
Any raised voice or anything?

30:15.140 --> 30:16.340
I never heard it.

30:17.620 --> 30:19.940
Well, you don't have to shout
to make your displeasure known,

30:19.940 --> 30:21.380
do you?

30:26.900 --> 30:29.060
It's possible they just didn't know.

30:33.860 --> 30:34.860
Detective.

30:40.700 --> 30:41.780
Um...

30:41.780 --> 30:44.900
I didn't want to mention this
in front of Abigail.

30:44.900 --> 30:46.220
Why distress her more?

30:46.220 --> 30:50.580
But the last time I saw Sophie,
about two weeks before she died,

30:50.580 --> 30:52.460
we had dinner together
here in Sydney

30:52.460 --> 30:55.060
and...and she had a bruise
on her chin.

30:55.060 --> 30:56.220
Stop it.

30:57.820 --> 30:58.980
What happened?

30:58.980 --> 31:00.500
(LAUGHS) It was stupid, really.

31:00.500 --> 31:01.940
We were out on Lloyd's boat

31:01.940 --> 31:04.380
and a jib sheet
whipped me in the face.

31:04.380 --> 31:06.380
You're alright, though?

31:07.620 --> 31:09.620
There's nothing you want to tell me?

31:11.220 --> 31:14.380
What? No, no, it's fine.

31:14.380 --> 31:16.220
I have to say, I didn't believe her.

31:16.220 --> 31:18.420
You think Tom might have hit her?

31:20.100 --> 31:21.700
That's what I thought at the time.

31:21.700 --> 31:24.340
But I couldn't say for sure.

31:31.680 --> 31:33.080
Shouldn't you be getting ready?

31:34.640 --> 31:36.280
It can take Anna hours.

31:36.280 --> 31:37.800
I'm not coming.

31:37.800 --> 31:39.480
I don't think I should.

31:39.480 --> 31:40.840
What?

31:41.840 --> 31:43.960
I thought
you were looking forward to it.

31:47.560 --> 31:48.840
I'm just a handbag.

31:48.840 --> 31:51.400
Are you, though? Really?

31:53.520 --> 31:56.320
Oh, God, that child.

31:56.320 --> 31:57.720
(THUD!)

31:57.720 --> 32:00.960
I'm sorry to give you
so little notice.

32:00.960 --> 32:02.960
Is there anyone else you can take?

32:04.440 --> 32:07.040
(MUSIC, LIVELY CHATTER)

32:26.040 --> 32:27.960
Oh, my God.

32:27.960 --> 32:29.440
The wealth, it's...

32:29.440 --> 32:31.000
Obscene.

32:32.400 --> 32:34.480
Intimidating.

32:34.480 --> 32:36.040
What?

32:36.040 --> 32:38.120
These women
should all be in awe of you.

32:39.120 --> 32:40.520
You outshine them all.

32:41.760 --> 32:43.600
(LAUGHS AWKWARDLY) Max.

32:43.600 --> 32:46.960
Even if you didn't mean it,
it's a wonderful thing to say.

32:48.800 --> 32:50.760
Oh, free drinks.

32:53.720 --> 32:56.360
So she'll open with a couple
of questions about Sophie.

32:56.360 --> 32:58.400
We agreed that would be OK. Yeah?
Mm-hm.

32:58.400 --> 33:00.040
Then she'll move on to trade,
the election.

33:00.040 --> 33:02.200
Nothing you can't handle.

33:02.200 --> 33:04.080
Is Greg meeting me later?

33:04.080 --> 33:05.960
He'll be here at nine.

33:05.960 --> 33:07.400
OK.

33:07.400 --> 33:08.920
Are we ready?

33:25.000 --> 33:26.000
Hello.

33:27.920 --> 33:30.000
Are you standing on your own?

33:30.000 --> 33:32.320
My date's gone for a pee.

33:32.320 --> 33:35.720
If I was your date,
I wouldn't leave your side.

33:35.720 --> 33:37.720
Then I hope
you have a strong bladder.

33:37.720 --> 33:39.080
(HALF-LAUGHS)

33:39.080 --> 33:41.200
I'm Angus.

33:41.200 --> 33:42.800
I'm a banker.

33:44.520 --> 33:45.520
Meg.

33:46.840 --> 33:49.600
Is cystic fibrosis
a cause close to your heart, Angus.

33:49.600 --> 33:51.440
Sorry?

33:51.440 --> 33:53.680
It's the charity
that this is in aid of.

33:53.680 --> 33:54.960
Is it?

33:54.960 --> 33:56.320
Oh.

33:56.320 --> 33:57.960
Oh, very good.

33:57.960 --> 34:02.160
But to be honest, I don't know
what cystic fibrosis is.

34:02.160 --> 34:03.680
It sounds nasty, though.

34:07.080 --> 34:09.640
So why are you here, Angus?

34:09.640 --> 34:11.320
Like everyone else.

34:11.320 --> 34:12.920
The networking.

34:12.920 --> 34:15.080
What is it that you do, Meg?

34:18.160 --> 34:21.800
Sophie and I shared the same values.

34:22.960 --> 34:26.120
Reducing poverty,
protecting the environment...

34:26.120 --> 34:31.680
And I can't think of a better way
to honour her memory

34:31.680 --> 34:34.960
than to achieve those goals.

34:34.960 --> 34:38.880
Your influence would be greatest
as prime minister.

34:38.880 --> 34:41.400
Is that where your ambitions lie?

34:41.400 --> 34:43.480
Well, there isn't a vacancy...

34:44.480 --> 34:45.800
..nor do I wish there to be.

34:46.920 --> 34:48.680
The Prime Minister
is doing a great job

34:48.680 --> 34:51.240
and I'm concentrating
on my portfolio.

34:51.240 --> 34:53.680
One of your responsibilities

34:53.680 --> 34:56.840
is to strike a trade agreement
with Australia.

34:56.840 --> 34:58.560
So far you haven't managed to.

34:58.560 --> 34:59.880
What's the problem?

34:59.880 --> 35:01.840
There's no problem.

35:01.840 --> 35:04.680
I had a meeting with my Australian
counterpart earlier today

35:04.680 --> 35:06.920
and we made great progress.

35:06.920 --> 35:08.280
Really?

35:08.280 --> 35:09.840
Because we've been hearing

35:09.840 --> 35:13.160
that there are still
significant areas of disagreement.

35:13.160 --> 35:16.520
Well, I don't know
who your sources are or...

35:16.520 --> 35:18.760
..whether they were
even in the room,

35:18.760 --> 35:20.200
but I was,

35:20.200 --> 35:24.480
and I can tell you
that agreement is close.

35:24.480 --> 35:26.120
Very close.

seeing how the other half lives?

35:55.120 --> 35:57.320
Anna. Finally.

35:59.560 --> 36:02.280
Thank you, Ben.
I'll see you in the morning.

36:06.000 --> 36:07.920
(DOOR OPENS)

36:11.200 --> 36:13.000
(DOOR CLOSES)

36:19.320 --> 36:21.080
I confess.

36:22.600 --> 36:24.320
You have me intrigued.

36:25.480 --> 36:26.480
(LAUGHS)

36:28.200 --> 36:29.360
You saw my interview.

36:29.360 --> 36:31.360
I can't work out your angle.

36:33.600 --> 36:35.920
Everyone knows
those trade talks are bogged down,

36:35.920 --> 36:39.160
but you were making it sound like
it was a done deal.

36:40.800 --> 36:41.840
Well...

36:41.840 --> 36:42.840
(SIGHS)

36:46.160 --> 36:48.520
The world knows
I'm here to make a deal.

36:50.480 --> 36:53.120
I have my pen out, itching to sign.

36:54.280 --> 36:56.240
If we can't reach agreement,

36:56.240 --> 36:58.360
it must be the fault
of the Australian government,

36:58.360 --> 36:59.440
mustn't it?

36:59.440 --> 37:01.160
You're preparing for failure.

37:03.040 --> 37:05.800
Well, wouldn't you rather
negotiations failed...

37:07.280 --> 37:09.600
..until after
you've won the election?

37:09.600 --> 37:10.680
(LAUGHS)

37:10.680 --> 37:14.160
Oh, you think as PM
I'd be easier to deal with?

37:14.160 --> 37:16.040
Not at all.

37:16.040 --> 37:20.840
I expect protracted talks demand
I be in Canberra on a regular basis.

37:20.840 --> 37:23.000
Mm.

37:23.000 --> 37:27.360
Well, then I may have to take a
personal interest in their progress.

37:28.960 --> 37:31.160
I won't hang around otherwise.

37:46.432 --> 37:50.032
He either runs a mile
or he wants to see your gun.

37:55.632 --> 37:57.632
You look like you're having fun.

37:57.632 --> 37:59.032
I've spoken to my wife.

38:00.752 --> 38:02.752
Told me she wants a divorce.

38:04.272 --> 38:05.312
Oh, shit.

38:06.312 --> 38:07.552
Sorry.

38:09.352 --> 38:11.392
We haven't been getting on
for a while.

38:12.552 --> 38:17.072
I just thought...me being here,
we might start to miss one another.

38:18.992 --> 38:23.792
Instead, I think we've realised
we can live without each other.

38:26.032 --> 38:27.432
Do you have any kids?

38:29.232 --> 38:30.232
No.

38:30.232 --> 38:32.392
It's messy when you have kids.

38:34.432 --> 38:36.672
You sound like
you speak from experience.

38:39.912 --> 38:41.232
You're kidding?

38:42.832 --> 38:44.072
Is that so surprising?

38:44.072 --> 38:46.352
Oh, yeah.

38:46.352 --> 38:49.312
Oh, you thought I was a lesbian?

38:49.312 --> 38:52.072
That's the third reaction guys have
when I say I'm a cop.

38:52.072 --> 38:55.192
I didn't know what to think.
You haven't told me anything.

38:55.192 --> 38:57.032
Well, I don't tell just anyone.

39:01.472 --> 39:02.832
His name's Louie.

39:02.832 --> 39:03.952
He's seven.

39:03.952 --> 39:07.792
I don't get to see him enough.
His dad's got custody.

39:07.792 --> 39:09.152
How come?

39:09.152 --> 39:12.392
Working homicide
makes being a parent difficult.

39:12.392 --> 39:13.552
The hours and stuff.

39:13.552 --> 39:15.032
That's what worries me...

39:16.232 --> 39:17.592
..as a father,

39:17.592 --> 39:19.872
that somehow I'll fall short.

39:21.192 --> 39:22.512
I'm a good mother.

39:24.712 --> 39:25.832
Mostly.

39:28.552 --> 39:29.792
Looks a great kid.

39:33.632 --> 39:39.752
Truth is, I think I might have fallen
for someone...here in Sydney.

39:40.752 --> 39:43.672
I didn't expect to
and I certainly didn't intend to.

39:43.672 --> 39:44.872
Max.

39:44.872 --> 39:46.752
Look, I've got to admit,

39:46.752 --> 39:49.912
I thought you were a dick
when you first arrived.

39:49.912 --> 39:52.272
And I've grown to respect you,

39:52.272 --> 39:53.592
like you, even,

39:53.592 --> 39:56.752
and under different circumstances...

39:56.752 --> 39:58.712
I didn't mean you.

39:58.712 --> 39:59.832
What?

39:59.832 --> 40:01.032
(LAUGHS) No.

40:01.032 --> 40:03.552
I mean,
you're obviously very attractive.

40:03.552 --> 40:05.832
But you're a colleague.

40:05.832 --> 40:08.112
It'd be like fancying my sister.

40:10.072 --> 40:11.872
So, who do you fancy, then?

40:13.752 --> 40:15.312
My sister-in-law. (LAUGHS)

40:15.312 --> 40:16.832
(LAUGHS)

40:16.832 --> 40:18.192
Oh.

40:18.192 --> 40:19.232
Oh...

40:19.232 --> 40:21.592
Well, does she feel the same way?

40:22.592 --> 40:24.912
I think she might. Yeah.

40:26.152 --> 40:27.672
Then go for it.

40:27.672 --> 40:30.232
You wife said she wants a divorce.
Why should she complain?

40:30.232 --> 40:31.832
Because...

40:31.832 --> 40:33.392
Because it's her sister.

40:34.872 --> 40:36.352
There is that.

40:46.152 --> 40:48.432
I bet those cameras
are working tonight.

40:49.792 --> 40:52.432
The cupboard where Lloyd
kept the CCTV equipment...

40:52.432 --> 40:54.112
Was empty.

40:54.112 --> 40:55.432
It was clean.

40:55.432 --> 40:57.192
It was cleared out nine months ago.

40:57.192 --> 40:58.752
You think it'd be dusty.

41:01.952 --> 41:03.072
I couldn't.

41:03.072 --> 41:04.552
I couldn't possibly.

41:04.552 --> 41:05.992
No, I couldn't possibly.

41:05.992 --> 41:07.192
Absolutely not.

41:08.072 --> 41:10.512
(MUSIC RAISES IN VOLUME AND TEMPO)

41:10.512 --> 41:12.312
(CHEERING)

41:30.352 --> 41:33.432
Man, he's a wanker, isn't he?

41:33.432 --> 41:35.912
Do you think
he's lying about the footage?

41:35.912 --> 41:38.472
I bet that it shows
that Sophie was here that night.

41:39.512 --> 41:41.512
Maybe even what happened to her.

41:41.512 --> 41:44.232
Well, finding out won't be easy.

41:44.232 --> 41:45.672
It's the North Shore, Max.

41:45.672 --> 41:48.632
It's well closed to outsiders.

41:50.232 --> 41:51.832
We're here, aren't we?

41:55.952 --> 41:58.632
If any of those bastards
were involved in Sophie's death,

41:58.632 --> 41:59.992
we're taking him down.

42:06.552 --> 42:08.552
(CHEERING)

42:08.552 --> 42:10.072
(APPLAUSE)

42:12.072 --> 42:14.272
You're going to salvage my marriage?

42:14.272 --> 42:15.992
I couldn't save my own.

42:15.992 --> 42:17.512
According to the lab report,

42:17.512 --> 42:19.512
the stone in the gash
on Sophie's head

42:19.512 --> 42:22.512
was high-grade,
centuries-old Carrara marble.

42:22.512 --> 42:23.992
You're going to go
to the police station

42:23.992 --> 42:27.792
and you are going to tell them
exactly what went down that night.

42:27.792 --> 42:30.032
I want you to cut all ties
with Lloyd Macklin.

42:30.032 --> 42:31.232
Why?

42:31.232 --> 42:34.312
There's a very good chance that
I will be the next prime minister.

42:34.312 --> 42:35.912
The fuck is she playing at?

42:35.912 --> 42:38.112
Justin, if I had known,
I would have told you.

42:38.112 --> 42:39.752
Mate, she has rolled over.

42:39.752 --> 42:41.792
OK. She has given Canberra
everything that they wanted.

42:41.792 --> 42:43.352
We know what happened.

42:43.352 --> 42:44.632
Do we?

42:48.312 --> 42:50.312
