00:00.084 --> 00:01.724
Previously on Dance Academy...

00:01.749 --> 00:03.713
I dance my best
when I'm with you guys.

00:03.733 --> 00:05.797
For my contemporary solo, I want you
all on stage doing it with me.

00:06.717 --> 00:08.717
I'm going to win the Prix
de Fonteyn, doing your solo

00:08.733 --> 00:09.765
and you're going to watch.

00:14.531 --> 00:17.491
The last thing he said was
how proud he was of us,

00:17.511 --> 00:20.467
but I can't put what I'm feeling
into my dancing.

00:20.487 --> 00:22.463
I'll pull you out
of the Prix de Fonteyn.

00:22.479 --> 00:23.543
I haven't cried since it happened.

00:24.459 --> 00:25.535
Trust me, it'll happen.

01:19.459 --> 01:20.527
My dream is back.

01:23.467 --> 01:25.491
It's officially become a nightmare.

01:36.503 --> 01:39.447
Help me, Sammy.
Help yourself, T.

01:47.535 --> 01:49.495
Red Shoes?

01:54.511 --> 01:56.523
You guys didn't need
to get me anything.

01:56.539 --> 01:58.471
That's what I said.

01:58.491 --> 02:00.447
We should just ignore
your 18th birthday.

02:04.475 --> 02:06.499
I hate that you're riding,

02:06.515 --> 02:09.471
but apparently this is the safest.

02:09.487 --> 02:10.526
It's all in the double stitching.

02:10.543 --> 02:12.531
It was Sammy's idea.

02:13.447 --> 02:14.539
He got us all to put in ages ago.

02:16.487 --> 02:18.491
Thanks, guys. It's great.

02:18.507 --> 02:21.471
So, summer plans?

02:21.491 --> 02:23.527
Can I tempt you with Barcelona?
We'll get the parentals over.

02:24.447 --> 02:28.483
Ah! Karamakov family
does Christmas Espanola.

02:28.503 --> 02:30.503
I was going to invite anyone
who wants

02:30.519 --> 02:32.491
to come back to the farm.

02:32.511 --> 02:34.479
I know it doesn't compare
with Europe, but...

02:34.499 --> 02:37.463
I haven't been to Spain,
but the farm's pretty special.

02:39.535 --> 02:41.507
Can I talk to you?

02:44.487 --> 02:46.455
I was ranked third in the Nationals.

02:46.475 --> 02:47.539
I guess it makes sense
that they asked.

02:48.455 --> 02:49.503
Sammy earned that place.

02:49.523 --> 02:51.479
How could you even be thinking
about it?

02:51.495 --> 02:52.527
I can't not.

02:53.447 --> 02:55.475
Competing in the Prix is like
a once in a lifetime opportunity.

02:55.495 --> 02:57.539
It affects my whole career.
An opportunity?

02:58.455 --> 02:59.511
You'd be dancing on his grave.

02:59.527 --> 03:02.459
Ignore her, Ben.

03:02.475 --> 03:04.455
You'd be moronic not to compete.

03:04.475 --> 03:06.531
She's just feeling guilty because
she's using Sammy as an excuse.

03:07.447 --> 03:08.483
Am I?

03:08.499 --> 03:09.531
Grace declared war but

03:10.451 --> 03:12.511
now you're going to use the grief
card and never stand up to her.

03:12.527 --> 03:14.459
That's not fair.

03:14.475 --> 03:15.511
Tara, none of this is fair.

03:15.531 --> 03:17.475
And nothing's going to make us
feel better,

03:17.495 --> 03:20.455
but extinguishing Grace,
like the pterodactyl she is,

03:20.471 --> 03:22.451
that'll help you sleep at night.

03:23.535 --> 03:25.479
You should do it.

03:34.511 --> 03:37.463
Distinguished guests,
ladies and gentlemen.

03:37.483 --> 03:40.527
Welcome to the International
Prix de Fonteyn.

03:42.519 --> 03:46.483
A week ago, the top dancers
from 19 countries

03:46.499 --> 03:48.511
were assessed in a group class.

03:48.527 --> 03:50.543
Over the next two days,

03:51.463 --> 03:53.543
the finalists will perform
solo variations

03:54.459 --> 03:56.491
to decide the best male

03:56.511 --> 03:59.511
and female ballet student
in the world.

03:59.527 --> 04:01.483
Hey. We're down the hall.

04:01.499 --> 04:03.491
And I'm sorry.

04:03.507 --> 04:06.451
He was quite a brilliant dancer.

04:06.467 --> 04:07.519
Thanks, mate.

04:07.535 --> 04:09.519
Hey, Tara, I'll meet you...

04:11.519 --> 04:13.535
Look, this was your revenge plot.

04:14.451 --> 04:15.483
I was happy with my decision.

04:15.503 --> 04:17.511
You beat her at the Nationals.
You'll beat her here again.

04:17.531 --> 04:20.527
She let me win at the Nationals.
So she said.

04:20.543 --> 04:22.503
And you didn't have me then.

04:22.523 --> 04:24.491
Tara, I've been watching you
for two years.

04:24.511 --> 04:27.467
I know your every strength
and every weakness.

04:27.483 --> 04:29.459
You just need to get your edge back.

04:29.475 --> 04:30.511
Come on.

04:32.543 --> 04:35.463
He was one of those truly
beautiful souls.

04:35.483 --> 04:38.539
I rang his parents and told them
I'm dedicating my solo to him.

04:40.499 --> 04:42.459
How noble.

04:43.543 --> 04:46.447
I thought you weren't up
to competing.

04:46.463 --> 04:48.475
I wasn't. I am now.

04:51.507 --> 04:53.463
Yay.

04:53.483 --> 04:55.523
Wouldn't have been a fraction
as much fun without you.

05:03.535 --> 05:05.535
Can't believe she showed.

05:07.539 --> 05:11.463
We're on a tight schedule because of
the Prix, so I assume you're warm.

05:12.487 --> 05:13.519
Katrina.

05:13.539 --> 05:16.535
Yeah, it's like a sauna
in my leotard.

05:17.455 --> 05:19.499
Your exams have been postponed
until after the holidays.

05:19.515 --> 05:21.523
I know. I want to take them now.

05:22.447 --> 05:24.487
We're giving the second years
special consideration.
Why don't you...

05:24.503 --> 05:26.471
I don't want it hanging over my head.

05:26.491 --> 05:28.495
Whether I'm coming back
to the Academy or not.

05:28.511 --> 05:30.527
I couldn't cope with that.

05:31.447 --> 05:33.507
If you sit them now you'll be marked
on this performance.

05:33.523 --> 05:35.539
Pass me if I'm good enough.

05:36.455 --> 05:37.527
Fail me if I'm crap.

05:46.451 --> 05:47.519
Thank you, everyone.

06:04.451 --> 06:05.511
Hey!

06:05.527 --> 06:07.459
You didn't have to come.

06:07.475 --> 06:08.535
Yeah, well it was either this or,

06:09.455 --> 06:10.523
you know,
punch a hole through my wall.

06:12.483 --> 06:14.539
Um, you should seriously think
about the farm option.

06:15.455 --> 06:17.503
You know how Dad loves free labour.

06:17.519 --> 06:20.479
What about Ben?

06:20.495 --> 06:21.527
Wouldn't it be awkward?

06:21.543 --> 06:23.507
Everything with Ben is awkward.

06:24.539 --> 06:26.523
I shouldn't have said that.

06:26.543 --> 06:29.535
It's just I know technically
we're still together.

06:30.455 --> 06:33.475
It just doesn't feel right
to be with him now.

06:34.511 --> 06:36.495
And with me, it would be...?

06:36.515 --> 06:38.539
Tara Webster to the stage.

06:39.455 --> 06:40.491
Tara Webster, this is...

06:40.511 --> 06:42.479
My entire life,
I will never understand you.

06:42.495 --> 06:43.527
Go!

07:17.467 --> 07:19.495
Look, I don't think anyone noticed.

07:19.515 --> 07:22.507
They're not blind. You handed her
at least four marks.

07:22.523 --> 07:25.451
Abs is right. Youchie.

07:25.471 --> 07:27.535
Grace Whitney representing
the United Kingdom.

07:28.451 --> 07:29.483
Shake it off.

07:29.503 --> 07:31.543
We always knew she was going to have
the upper hand in contemporary.

07:32.463 --> 07:34.535
She'll win again tomorrow with
The Red Shoes. You should see her.

07:48.479 --> 07:50.523
Why don't you do it as well?
The Red Shoes?

07:50.543 --> 07:54.447
You want to dance that solo so much
you dream about it.

07:54.463 --> 07:55.535
It's bad luck.

07:56.455 --> 07:57.495
Last time I did it
was the Preliminaries

07:57.511 --> 07:59.447
and Saskia was right then.

07:59.463 --> 08:00.519
I could never do it justice.

08:00.539 --> 08:03.543
Saskia said you didn't have enough
life experience.

08:04.463 --> 08:06.531
You want a tally of
what you've been through this year?

08:07.535 --> 08:09.487
There's another version.

08:09.507 --> 08:12.451
Not the one Saskia did,
the original.

08:12.467 --> 08:14.455
It would really suit you.

08:17.515 --> 08:20.491
I've got a son who's 18? Wow.

08:20.507 --> 08:22.499
Yeah, it was yesterday.

08:22.515 --> 08:25.451
What do you want, Raf?

08:25.467 --> 08:28.455
Look, I saw it in the paper.

08:28.471 --> 08:31.455
About your mate, and, well,

08:31.471 --> 08:32.539
I'm still doing the Tassie trip.

08:33.458 --> 08:34.543
You know, great bit of road.
Great surf.

08:35.462 --> 08:37.515
I've got plans.
Oh, good.

08:37.534 --> 08:39.523
It's just I'd thought you might like
to get away.

08:39.539 --> 08:41.486
Clear your head and all that.

08:41.506 --> 08:44.451
What, 'cause that's what you do?
You'd bail?

08:44.467 --> 08:46.543
Yeah, probably.

08:47.463 --> 08:49.487
But you're a lot smarter than I am
so...

08:49.507 --> 08:51.515
I've gotta go.
Oh, right.

08:52.543 --> 08:55.491
Look, if there's anything, you know,
I canP

09:05.503 --> 09:08.523
OK. So we've gone through
the happy, deluded part

09:08.543 --> 09:10.535
where Victoria thinks
she can have everything.

09:13.487 --> 09:16.507
Now, we're into the dark,
competition winning, territory.

09:19.479 --> 09:21.467
Good.

09:25.515 --> 09:27.463
Tara.

09:27.479 --> 09:28.515
No, actual tears.

09:28.535 --> 09:30.479
Grace is going to exploit
the melodrama.

09:30.495 --> 09:32.507
You have to be real.

09:32.523 --> 09:34.507
I can't cry. I told you that.

09:34.523 --> 09:38.471
Which is why I'm going to do Aurora.

09:42.491 --> 09:44.523
You cry every time
you step on an ant.

09:44.539 --> 09:47.467
You're a crier.

09:49.503 --> 09:51.495
Why the blockage?

09:54.519 --> 09:56.463
When I broke my back,

09:56.483 --> 10:01.503
it was like falling into a hole that
I didn't know how to get out of.

10:04.479 --> 10:06.511
This is a million times worse.

10:09.519 --> 10:12.491
I'm scared,

10:12.511 --> 10:17.455
that if I start crying,
I'm not going to be able to stop.

10:20.463 --> 10:23.499
No, you're stronger than that.

10:23.515 --> 10:25.447
That's not the reason.

10:25.463 --> 10:26.523
Then what is?

10:27.527 --> 10:30.511
If you cry, it's real.

10:33.539 --> 10:37.467
And if it's real, he's gone.

11:16.523 --> 11:19.471
Going into the final day
of competition,

11:19.491 --> 11:22.535
the highest ranked dancers are
Grace Whitney, United Kingdom,

11:23.451 --> 11:25.523
and Carlos Magri, Brazil.

11:26.543 --> 11:30.475
Today's scores will be withheld
until the final tally.

11:30.491 --> 11:32.499
Good luck to all competitors.

11:35.515 --> 11:38.511
So, if you win, what scholarship?

11:38.527 --> 11:40.463
Paris Opera? Toronto?

11:40.483 --> 11:42.527
I haven't thought about it yet.
You should.

11:47.523 --> 11:50.483
Magri's pretty weak in contemporary.

11:59.515 --> 12:01.459
Hey.

12:01.475 --> 12:02.523
Um, can we...

12:02.539 --> 12:05.455
No, Christian. No, you can't.

12:05.471 --> 12:07.475
Because if you break her focus now,

12:07.495 --> 12:08.539
I'll pierce this
through your skullcap.

12:09.455 --> 12:12.455
It's fine. 30 seconds. Please?

12:19.451 --> 12:20.511
I wanted to...

12:20.527 --> 12:22.507
Sorry, you go.

12:23.543 --> 12:25.487
The day that Sammy...

12:25.507 --> 12:29.527
He left me a message saying
that you were coming

12:29.543 --> 12:31.499
to talk to me about something.

12:31.515 --> 12:33.459
Yeah, I was.

12:33.475 --> 12:34.507
So...

12:34.527 --> 12:38.511
Look, what'd you mean about it being
right with me and not with Ben?

12:38.527 --> 12:40.527
I don't know.

12:40.543 --> 12:42.527
Ben and I are brand-new.

12:43.531 --> 12:48.499
We only got together
just before it happened.

12:48.515 --> 12:50.535
But with you...

12:51.543 --> 12:53.515
We have history?

12:53.531 --> 12:56.495
Plus, he's so Ben, you know?

12:56.511 --> 12:58.507
He's gone through a lot of stuff,

12:58.527 --> 13:03.451
but he always remains untouched
and uncomplicated.

13:03.467 --> 13:04.527
Happy.

13:04.543 --> 13:07.447
They sound like good things.

13:07.463 --> 13:08.531
They are.

13:09.447 --> 13:11.455
But I don't match that anymore.

13:13.451 --> 13:15.491
OK, time's up. Evaporate.

13:25.487 --> 13:28.455
The next performance
will commence in one minute.

13:28.475 --> 13:31.495
The next performance will commence
in one minute.

13:33.531 --> 13:35.483
I didn't miss it, did I?

13:38.487 --> 13:40.459
Ran... straight...

13:40.475 --> 13:42.467
from... exam.

13:42.483 --> 13:44.459
How was pas de deux?

13:45.499 --> 13:49.459
If I make it into second year,
we're working on my cardio.

13:49.479 --> 13:52.459
Representing the United
Kingdom, Grace Whitney,

13:52.475 --> 13:54.503
performing Victoria, The Red Shoes.

14:16.495 --> 14:18.543
Technically and artistically perfect.

14:20.459 --> 14:22.471
And yet...

14:22.491 --> 14:26.483
Grace has never felt a genuine human
emotion in her life,

14:28.539 --> 14:30.487
and it shows.

14:40.515 --> 14:42.459
That was beautiful.

14:42.475 --> 14:44.495
I think it was a 9, 9.5.

14:44.511 --> 14:47.511
How does it feel to go out there

14:47.531 --> 14:50.507
knowing I've already taken away
what you want most?

14:54.511 --> 14:56.507
Representing Australia,

14:56.527 --> 15:00.471
Tara Webster, also performing
The Red Shoes.

15:12.463 --> 15:14.507
What made you pick Red Shoes?

15:14.523 --> 15:16.523
Victoria's pain.

15:16.539 --> 15:18.479
Performing while she's grieving.

15:18.499 --> 15:20.451
You could never do it properly.

15:34.527 --> 15:37.527
So, you've experienced
grief and heartbreak?

15:37.543 --> 15:39.499
Yes.

15:39.519 --> 15:42.447
No, you haven't.
You're a child.

15:42.467 --> 15:44.467
All I see is a silly kid
flouncing around,

15:44.487 --> 15:47.487
yet you're arrogant enough
to think that you're an artist.

16:00.527 --> 16:02.479
Help me, Sammy.

16:02.495 --> 16:04.527
Help yourself, T.

16:11.543 --> 16:13.531
You're meant to be dancing.

16:20.447 --> 16:22.463
Everything's wrong without you.

16:22.479 --> 16:24.499
We're all going to fall apart.

16:24.519 --> 16:28.539
No you won't, because you're going
to be the glue.

16:31.463 --> 16:32.527
You'll miss me because I'm awesome,

16:32.543 --> 16:35.539
but you'll be OK.

16:36.543 --> 16:39.463
But I don't want to be OK.

16:42.475 --> 16:44.515
I don't want to let you go.

16:44.531 --> 16:47.543
I can't, Sammy.

16:48.459 --> 16:49.499
Yes, you can, T.

16:49.515 --> 16:51.519
Here.

18:06.519 --> 18:08.479
Shouldn't you be side stage?

18:08.499 --> 18:10.543
Look, I know you want to push me
away, and I get it.

18:11.459 --> 18:14.451
I'm so sorry.

18:14.467 --> 18:15.535
No, no, you don't need to be.

18:16.455 --> 18:19.483
Look, you can break up with me
and keep me at a 5km radius,

18:19.499 --> 18:21.475
and I'll just keep waiting.

18:21.495 --> 18:24.519
Because we're going to be good
for each other,

18:24.539 --> 18:26.531
and eventually you'll be ready
to see it.

18:27.451 --> 18:29.499
Benjamin Tickle,
this is your one minute call.

18:29.515 --> 18:31.487
Go. Now.

18:31.503 --> 18:33.455
I need you out front.

18:34.491 --> 18:36.455
You guys too.

18:46.495 --> 18:48.487
Quite the coach now, aren't you?

18:48.507 --> 18:51.487
I bet they don't dance like that
in Barcelona.

18:51.503 --> 18:54.451
They don't dance like you, either.

18:54.471 --> 18:57.467
In the Boys' Contemporary
section,

18:57.487 --> 19:00.451
Benjamin Tickle,
representing Australia.

19:09.483 --> 19:11.531
My friend, Sammy Lieberman,

19:12.447 --> 19:14.499
he was meant to be here, but...

19:14.515 --> 19:17.531
Well, he had some pretty unique ideas

19:18.451 --> 19:20.467
about what he wanted to do
in this section.

19:20.483 --> 19:22.447
So I'm going to go with that.

19:22.463 --> 19:24.503
I'm sorry, Benjamin.

19:24.523 --> 19:26.511
All choreography has to be approved
in advance.

19:26.527 --> 19:28.475
I know.

19:28.495 --> 19:30.499
You'll just have to disqualify me,
then.

19:42.503 --> 19:46.451
Every dancer knows that being
technically perfect isn't enough.

19:46.467 --> 19:48.515
We need to know why we dance.

19:57.507 --> 19:59.467
For me, it's to be connected.

20:00.491 --> 20:02.455
I'm inspired by my friends.

20:05.499 --> 20:08.479
Guys, you're leaving me
on a limb here.

22:14.491 --> 22:16.471
Grace won the Internationals

22:16.487 --> 22:18.447
and the title of Best in the World.

22:18.463 --> 22:20.511
But she was wrong.

22:20.527 --> 22:23.503
Winning was never what I wanted most.

22:25.487 --> 22:27.519
I may not be the girl who dreams of
flying anymore.

22:27.535 --> 22:29.535
She crashed too many times.

22:30.451 --> 22:31.543
Hit the ground too hard.

22:33.515 --> 22:36.535
Now I dance with my feet
on the ground and my eyes open,

22:37.455 --> 22:39.515
which means I can better appreciate
this adventure I'm on.

22:39.535 --> 22:41.531
Airport, please.
International terminal.

22:42.447 --> 22:44.483
Muchas gracias.

22:45.543 --> 22:47.491
Gracias.

22:49.507 --> 22:51.539
This adventure requires faith.

23:00.487 --> 23:04.487
The committee said I could choose
any school in the world.

23:04.503 --> 23:06.523
It requires humility.

23:06.539 --> 23:08.487
I choose the Academy.

23:11.475 --> 23:13.463
And always love.

23:13.479 --> 23:15.531
I'll be back. I promise.

23:17.463 --> 23:18.515
For third year.

23:36.495 --> 23:39.511
You know, country girls don't
actually dress like that.

23:39.527 --> 23:42.467
What? I was getting into character!

23:42.483 --> 23:44.495
Come here.

23:49.459 --> 23:50.503
In second year,

23:50.523 --> 23:52.515
they told us there would be
no second chances.

23:52.531 --> 23:54.479
They were right.

23:54.499 --> 23:58.535
We have to dance each day
as if it could be our last.
