00:04.770 --> 00:06.761
*

00:10.810 --> 00:12.539
If I die before you,

00:12.580 --> 00:14.605
please don't let them read
"Wind Beneath My Wings"

00:14.640 --> 00:16.505
at my funeral.

00:16.550 --> 00:19.542
Who knew it had
so many verses?

00:19.580 --> 00:21.013
(both chuckle)

00:25.290 --> 00:27.383
You think
that we didn't know him

00:27.420 --> 00:29.729
or his family didn't?

00:29.760 --> 00:32.228
Maybe he changed.

00:32.260 --> 00:35.058
They said he liked
nighttime walks in the snow?

00:35.100 --> 00:36.624
He hated the snow.

00:36.670 --> 00:38.092
(both snicker)

00:38.130 --> 00:40.189
What about that food?

00:40.240 --> 00:41.639
I didn't know he cooked.

00:41.670 --> 00:44.138
He didn't!
They're crazy.

00:44.170 --> 00:46.309
(both laugh)

00:46.340 --> 00:48.399
I need another drink.

00:50.580 --> 00:54.209
We were like
the two mistresses
at the Irish funeral.

00:54.250 --> 00:56.810
Yep.

00:56.850 --> 01:00.354
Oh, I'm sorry.
I meant that metaphorically.

01:00.390 --> 01:01.584
I know.

01:01.620 --> 01:04.657
(laughs)

01:06.300 --> 01:07.597
Thank you.

01:10.130 --> 01:11.427
(clears throat)

01:12.840 --> 01:14.796
To Will.

01:14.840 --> 01:17.104
To Will,
a real man.

01:18.410 --> 01:20.298
He shall be missed.

01:25.410 --> 01:28.277
DIANE:
My dad was a sloppy drunk.

01:28.320 --> 01:31.187
I said I'd never be like him.
(snorts)

01:31.220 --> 01:33.279
You're not sloppy.

01:33.320 --> 01:35.515
You're elegant.

01:35.560 --> 01:39.121
Mm, I always wanted
to be like you.

01:39.160 --> 01:41.355
No.
No, I did.

01:41.400 --> 01:44.289
When I came to
Lockhart/Gardner,

01:44.330 --> 01:49.165
the way you... held yourself.

01:49.210 --> 01:51.861
I was a great disappointment
to my mother.

01:51.910 --> 01:54.777
She wanted me to be a nurse.

01:54.810 --> 01:58.143
Get married, have three kids.

01:58.180 --> 01:59.317
Be a nurse.

01:59.350 --> 02:00.647
My mom thinks
I'm a prude.

02:00.680 --> 02:02.511
(laughs)

02:02.550 --> 02:08.216
I know. She thinks
I should loosen up

02:08.260 --> 02:10.683
and get laid more.

02:10.730 --> 02:12.857
(phone rings)
Oh, no.

02:12.900 --> 02:15.357
Oh, let me guess.

02:15.400 --> 02:18.369
Yep, it's David Lee.

02:18.400 --> 02:19.936
Hey, let me answer.

02:19.970 --> 02:22.268
It'll terrify him.

02:22.310 --> 02:24.437
Come on. He'll think _
we're merging or something.

02:24.470 --> 02:25.767
Come on.

02:25.810 --> 02:27.778
(phone beeps)
(laughs)

02:27.810 --> 02:30.506
I'm so alone there.

02:30.550 --> 02:35.772
Partners look at me like
I'm a gazelle on the savanna.

02:35.820 --> 02:37.811
They always looked
at you like that.

02:37.850 --> 02:40.216
No, this is different.

02:40.260 --> 02:43.229
Will was on a buying binge.

02:43.260 --> 02:44.921
Now we're overextended.

02:44.960 --> 02:46.894
Yeah, we are, too.

02:49.000 --> 02:50.695
Well, we should merge.

02:52.840 --> 02:53.966
What?

02:54.000 --> 02:55.763
We should merge our firms.

02:55.800 --> 02:58.462
How would we do that?

02:58.510 --> 03:00.432
By saying we will.

03:00.480 --> 03:02.402
You would want that?

03:02.450 --> 03:03.439
Well, I would want
Chumhum back.

03:03.480 --> 03:06.711
That would_ solve a lot
of my Issues.

03:06.750 --> 03:08.615
You'd take Chumhum and
(clicks tongue)

03:08.650 --> 03:10.242
get rid of us.

03:10.290 --> 03:12.417
No. We'd draw up
a contract.

03:12.460 --> 03:15.349
I have to have someone
to take WIll's place anyway.

03:15.390 --> 03:18.848
Our firms are fighting
on a lot of fronts.

03:18.890 --> 03:21.450
Oh, and your client is divorcing
our client.

03:21.500 --> 03:23.559
No, your client
is divorcing ours.

03:23.600 --> 03:27.229
(chuckles)

03:27.270 --> 03:30.398
Well, so, let's keep talking.

03:30.440 --> 03:32.635
We'll make peace and...

03:32.680 --> 03:34.807
Come on. We'll figure out
how to make this work.

03:39.550 --> 03:40.972
(elevator bell dings)

03:41.020 --> 03:43.716
CARY:
Your husband's divorce lavwer's
named David Lee.

03:43.750 --> 03:46.480
He can be very contentious,
so don't get thrown by anything.

03:46.520 --> 03:47.885
I don't get thrown
by anything anymore.

03:47.920 --> 03:49.387
We have leverage.

03:49.430 --> 03:50.954
Your husband...
Ex-husband.

03:50.990 --> 03:52.628
No, now, Carol,

03:52.660 --> 03:53.991
remember he's only
your ex-husband

03:54.030 --> 03:55.292
when you grant
a divorce.

03:55.330 --> 03:57.264
Otherwise, according
to Illinois law,

03:57.300 --> 03:58.597
he_has to wait
SIX months.

03:58.630 --> 04:00.359
That's my leverage.
That's your leverage, okay?

04:00.400 --> 04:02.265
(elevator bell dings)
Now, he wants to get
remarried right now,

04:02.310 --> 04:06.030
but he can only
do that if you
say, yes, okay?

04:06.070 --> 04:07.332
Excuse me.

04:07.380 --> 04:08.301
Alicia...

04:08.340 --> 04:10.342
Am I early?
No, I...

04:10.380 --> 04:13.543
What are you doing here?
You don't have to be here.

04:13.580 --> 04:15.741
I thought you were
taking the week off.

04:15.780 --> 04:18.248
No, I'm good. Ready to go.

04:19.720 --> 04:22.052
Cary, please, I'm ﬁne.

04:22.090 --> 04:25.423
Don't worry. I'm not gonna
fall apart on you.

04:25.460 --> 04:26.392
Let's go.

04:26.430 --> 04:28.352
Hello, Carol. How are you?

04:28.400 --> 04:29.560
I'm good, Asher.

04:29.600 --> 04:30.828
Wow, you're tan.

04:30.870 --> 04:31.894
I was in California.

04:31.930 --> 04:34.069
Oh! Huh, the book.

04:34.100 --> 04:35.465
How's it selling?

04:35.500 --> 04:37.604
Okay, that's enough
small talk for now.

04:37.640 --> 04:38.800
Alicia, Cary, welcome.

04:38.840 --> 04:40.068
Hello, Cary and Alicia.

04:40.110 --> 04:41.975
Excuse me a minute.

04:42.010 --> 04:44.570
Diane, what are you
doing here?

04:44.610 --> 04:46.373
Sitting in.
Why?

04:46.420 --> 04:49.446
Because I'm here.

04:49.490 --> 04:51.947
Okay, we would rather
this not be contentious,

04:51.990 --> 04:53.014
so we're willing
to compromise.

04:53.060 --> 04:56.450
Carol will grant Mr. Mercer's
request for a divorce.

04:56.490 --> 04:59.027
Mr. Mercer is not asking
for a divorce. He...

04:59.060 --> 05:00.698
We don't want this
to be contentious, either.

05:00.730 --> 05:04.962
Good. Then to answer Mr. Lee,
yes, your client did

05:05.000 --> 05:06.592
ask for a divorce
after sleeping with...

05:06.640 --> 05:08.335
ALICIA:
We_don't need to
go Into that here

05:08.370 --> 05:11.339
if we're all agreed
to our terms.

05:11.370 --> 05:12.906
A grant of divorce
in trade

05:12.940 --> 05:14.828
for leniency
on the postnuptials?

05:14.880 --> 05:16.973
Yes. So the only question
is custody.

05:17.010 --> 05:19.808
And since we all want
what's best for Nico,

05:19.850 --> 05:22.114
that would prove to be a simple
matter of visitation rights.

05:22.150 --> 05:25.347
Good! So basically,
we're done. Carol?

05:25.390 --> 05:27.779
If Asher agrees.
All I want is
for this to be over.

05:27.820 --> 05:30.618
Mr. Mercer, if you can
give me some wiggle room,
I can get...

05:30.660 --> 05:33.458
David, he's already
stated his preference.

05:33.500 --> 05:35.024
Yes, and I am offering
my opinion.

05:35.060 --> 05:36.664
Mr. Mercer?

05:36.700 --> 05:39.021
All I want is for
everybody to be happy.

05:39.070 --> 05:41.391
Good. Well, then
we have a deal.

05:41.440 --> 05:44.034
Except for custody.

05:44.070 --> 05:45.469
What the hell
was that?!

05:45.510 --> 05:46.579
That was called

05:46.610 --> 05:48.475
turning down
the temperature.

05:48.510 --> 05:50.148
You ought
to try it sometime.

05:50.180 --> 05:53.877
Diane, if this is about Will,

05:53.920 --> 05:57.014
you should take a break
and go on vacation.

05:57.050 --> 05:58.517
David, I have some advice
for you.

05:58.550 --> 06:00.450
Whenever you're tempted
to bring up Will's death

06:00.490 --> 06:03.027
and credit my behavior to it,
resist.

06:03.060 --> 06:06.154
Diane, I have
some advice for you.

06:06.190 --> 06:08.920
When in mourning,
don't make big decisions.

06:08.960 --> 06:12.123
At least for a year.

06:12.170 --> 06:14.536
Really?!

06:14.570 --> 06:16.435
Gretchen, move David Lee
out of his current office

06:16.470 --> 06:18.438
and into, um,
that office back there.

06:18.470 --> 06:19.630
You can't do that.
Yes, I can.

06:19.680 --> 06:22.103
I'm on the infrastructure
committee. Too bad you're not.

06:22.140 --> 06:25.075
Is that a big enough
decision for you?

06:29.790 --> 06:32.554
You know why she's doing
what she's doing?

06:32.590 --> 06:33.989
Why?

06:34.020 --> 06:37.524
I went to a bar
after Will's funeral.

06:37.560 --> 06:38.788
I wanted to be alone.

06:38.830 --> 06:41.697
I liked him.
I miss him.

06:41.730 --> 06:44.824
Why is she doing
what she's doing?

06:44.870 --> 06:47.691
And I happened to hear
two women talking
over a deal

06:47.740 --> 06:49.662
suggesting their
two firms merge.

06:49.710 --> 06:51.200
And do you know
what, David?

06:51.240 --> 06:53.606
Those two women
looked an awful
lot like Diane

06:53.640 --> 06:55.631
and Alicia Florrick.

06:55.680 --> 06:56.999
Is this true?

06:58.850 --> 07:02.047
She wants someone who will be
in her back pocket.

07:02.080 --> 07:04.617
So, we should do
something about it.

07:04.650 --> 07:06.083
CARY:
That was interesting.

07:06.120 --> 07:07.712
We got the result
we wanted.

07:07.760 --> 07:09.216
CAREY:
Cary, uh, do you
have a minute?

07:09.260 --> 07:11.080
Sure, what's up?

07:11.130 --> 07:15.226
CAREY:
Mr. Grant, this is Cary Agos.

07:15.260 --> 07:17.763
Mr. Grant's has a case, and
he's without representation.

07:17.800 --> 07:20.064
GRANT:
Yes, that's the problem.

07:20.100 --> 07:22.500
Lockhart/Gardner
won't take the case
for obvrous reasons.

07:22.540 --> 07:24.098
Because of Will?
Yes.

07:24.140 --> 07:26.973
Listen, I don't think
my son's responsible
for Will Gardner's death.

07:27.010 --> 07:28.602
Jeffrey was out
of his mind.

07:28.640 --> 07:30.642
The state's attorney's
office prosecuted him

07:30.680 --> 07:32.238
for a crime
he didn't commit.

07:32.280 --> 07:34.214
That's what forced him
to grab the gun.

07:34.250 --> 07:35.808
It's the state's attorney
that's at fault,

07:35.850 --> 07:37.078
and I'm gonna sue them.

07:37.120 --> 07:38.087
Sue them for?

07:38.120 --> 07:40.088
Wrongful prosecution.

07:40.120 --> 07:41.951
(gunshot)
CARY:
A wrongful prosecution suit

07:41.990 --> 07:43.457
is extremely hard to win.

07:43.490 --> 07:45.526
CAREY: Yes, except that he's
already had a meeting
with the state's attorney.

07:45.560 --> 07:46.652
GRANT:
Yes, he came to my house.

07:46.700 --> 07:47.894
CARY:
He came to you?

07:47.930 --> 07:49.591
Yes, Castro.

07:49.630 --> 07:50.528
He apologized.
He assured me

07:50.570 --> 07:52.561
that heads would roll
in his department.

07:52.600 --> 07:53.862
CAREY:
He wants this to be over.

07:53.900 --> 07:55.197
He wants
to clear the decks.

07:55.240 --> 07:59.267
Uh, Mr. Grant, you know
Alicia Florrick?

07:59.310 --> 08:01.574
Yes. Mrs. Florrick, hello.

08:01.610 --> 08:02.269
Hello.

08:02.310 --> 08:03.846
You were very nice to Jeffrey.

08:03.880 --> 08:06.041
CARY:
All right, so let's
take a step back

08:06.080 --> 08:07.775
and discuss the idea
of you filing suit.

08:07.820 --> 08:09.549
CAREY:
Cary's gorng to tell you

08:09.590 --> 08:11.649
there's a very high bar for
a wrongful prosecution...

08:11.690 --> 08:13.157
which is true.
What heads?

08:13.190 --> 08:15.511
What?

08:15.560 --> 08:18.882
You said Castro said,
"Heads would roll." Which heads?

08:18.930 --> 08:22.718
Well, he didn't say.
Is that important to the suit?

08:22.770 --> 08:24.692
CAREY:
No, we're just getting
more of a sense of the facts.

08:27.840 --> 08:30.536
Why? Why'd you ask that?

08:30.570 --> 08:32.629
We can't take this case.

08:32.680 --> 08:34.079
Because of Will?

08:35.580 --> 08:37.309
Oh, we... we have to listen.

08:37.350 --> 08:39.545
He'll just take the case
to someone else.

08:39.580 --> 08:43.243
Cary, listen to me. You take
this case, I quit the firm.

08:44.290 --> 08:47.179
I understand.

08:47.220 --> 08:48.551
I'll talk to him.

08:48.590 --> 08:50.979
I don't give a damn.

08:52.230 --> 08:54.596
Alicia, he's meeting
with the state's attorney.

08:54.630 --> 08:56.564
He told us that in confidence.
You cannot use It.

08:56.600 --> 08:59.125
Thank you, Cary.

08:59.170 --> 09:01.195
Yes, um, hello.
Can you put me through

09:01.240 --> 09:04.801
to a Finn Polmar's room.
I think he's in the ICU.

09:04.840 --> 09:07.673
He had the gunshot wound
to the shoulder.

09:07.710 --> 09:08.972
Mrs. Florrick, your appointment.

09:11.650 --> 09:15.609
Oh, I see. When? Thank you.

09:15.650 --> 09:19.245
Sondra, I need you to locate
the number of a Finn Polmar.

09:19.290 --> 09:21.986
He's the new ASA at the
state's attorney's office.

09:22.020 --> 09:23.624
He just got released
from the hospital.

09:23.660 --> 09:25.651
Sure. Do you want
me to connect you?

09:25.690 --> 09:27.590
Just let him know
I need to talk to him,

09:27.630 --> 09:28.722
and I'll be right back.

09:28.760 --> 09:30.091
PETER:
Well, the Sinclair Mission

09:30.130 --> 09:31.791
is exactly what families
in Illinois need.

09:31.830 --> 09:33.889
And I really have
to thank my wife

09:33.940 --> 09:35.259
for bringing it
to my attention.

09:35.300 --> 09:36.665
(camera shutters clicking)
My husband's being humble.

09:36.710 --> 09:38.837
It didn't need to be brought
to his attention.

09:38.870 --> 09:41.270
Well, we'll, uh,
we'll agree to disagree.

09:41.310 --> 09:43.369
At any rate,
if you'll excuse us,

09:43.410 --> 09:47.016
Alicia_and I have
to discuss our
son's SAT scores.

09:47.050 --> 09:49.314
(reporters laugh)
Thank you very much.

09:49.350 --> 09:51.318
MAN:
Can you stand back please.
Thank you.

09:51.350 --> 09:53.011
Are you all right?

09:53.060 --> 09:55.210
I'm here posing
with you for a photo op.

09:55.260 --> 09:56.625
Why wouldn't I be?

09:56.660 --> 09:58.685
Because of Will.

09:58.730 --> 10:02.689
I'm here for you, Peter.
What do you want from me?

10:02.730 --> 10:04.721
Well, I'd like
my wife back.

10:04.770 --> 10:05.828
I'm here.

10:05.870 --> 10:07.235
Are you?

10:07.270 --> 10:10.831
Oh, dear God, would everyone
just stop thinking

10:10.870 --> 10:13.179
I'm falling apart at
the friggin' seams?!

10:13.210 --> 10:14.802
Everyone?
When did I become everyone?

10:17.680 --> 10:20.649
(car door opens, closes)

10:20.680 --> 10:22.887
(phones ringing,
indistinct chatter nearby)

10:22.920 --> 10:26.310
Good. I think
we can handle
shared custody now.

10:26.350 --> 10:28.181
Nico is five years old,

10:28.220 --> 10:31.087
and we don't want to disrupt
his home life. Are we agreed?

10:31.130 --> 10:32.722
DAVID:
Hello.

10:32.760 --> 10:34.694
Hello, David, we're
almost settled here.

10:34.730 --> 10:35.856
Good.

10:35.900 --> 10:37.197
What nice offices, Cary.

10:37.230 --> 10:40.768
Very 19905 T-shirt factory.

10:40.800 --> 10:41.630
Thanks.
Where's Alicia?

10:41.670 --> 10:43.433
I thought she'd want
to be here for this.

10:43.470 --> 10:44.903
She'll be here in a minute.
What do you got?

10:44.940 --> 10:46.771
A nanny cam video.

10:46.810 --> 10:48.732
What nanny cam video?

10:48.780 --> 10:51.874
You and Asher agreed to have
installed in your house.

10:51.910 --> 10:53.138
(laughs)

10:53.180 --> 10:54.738
What's this about, Ash?

10:54.780 --> 10:55.849
Uh, David. We're decided.

10:58.150 --> 11:00.084
(passionate moaning)

11:00.120 --> 11:01.087
Oh, my God!

11:01.120 --> 11:02.849
You took that of me?!

11:02.890 --> 11:03.857
You were sleeping
with one of my students.

11:03.890 --> 11:04.857
What was I supposed to do?

11:04.890 --> 11:05.788
_You ran Off
With your nurse!

11:05.830 --> 11:07.923
I didn't run off.
What would you call it?!

11:07.960 --> 11:09.928
I'd call it grounds
for voiding your postnup.

11:09.970 --> 11:10.720
Infidelity.

11:10.770 --> 11:12.362
You're trying to
make me the villain?

11:12.400 --> 11:14.288
Maybe we should
settle this in court.

11:14.340 --> 11:16.331
(all talking over one another)

11:16.370 --> 11:18.201
Wait a minute!
You want to settle this,

11:18.240 --> 11:20.708
you don't want
this video shown in court,

11:20.740 --> 11:21.877
then take 20 cents
on the dollar.

11:21.910 --> 11:22.877
Like hell I will.

11:22.910 --> 11:24.844
Then we'll see you in court.

11:45.100 --> 11:46.169
DIANE:
KaHnda?

11:46.200 --> 11:48.430
I was just about to call you.

11:48.470 --> 11:50.165
I, um,

11:50.210 --> 11:51.734
I need a favor.

11:51.770 --> 11:52.976
Okay.

11:53.010 --> 11:55.774
I, uh, need you to go

11:55.810 --> 11:57.107
to Will's apartment.

11:57.150 --> 11:59.209
Okay.

11:59.250 --> 12:00.478
Why?

12:00.520 --> 12:02.408
I need to know how many
commitments we've made

12:02.450 --> 12:04.418
in New York and LA.

12:04.450 --> 12:07.010
His family boxed up
his work things.

12:07.060 --> 12:08.379
Bring them back here.

12:08.420 --> 12:10.957
Okay, I'll, uh,

12:10.990 --> 12:12.184
I'll head over.

12:15.230 --> 12:17.164
Diane?

12:17.200 --> 12:19.896
David Lee and Damian are trying

12:19.940 --> 12:22.909
to remove you
as managing partner.

12:24.470 --> 12:25.903
How do you know?

12:25.940 --> 12:27.237
I heard them talking.

12:27.280 --> 12:31.046
Without Will, they feel...

12:31.080 --> 12:33.139
you're unprotected.

12:35.350 --> 12:37.238
What do you want me to do?

12:37.290 --> 12:40.088
(huffs)

12:40.120 --> 12:42.315
(laughs):
I don't know.

12:42.360 --> 12:44.328
Well, you have to gather votes
to fight them.

12:44.360 --> 12:46.419
It'll never end, Kalinda.

12:46.460 --> 12:48.849
I can't fight them anymore.

12:48.900 --> 12:50.492
If they want to come after me,
let them...

12:50.530 --> 12:54.136
friggin' come after me.

12:55.240 --> 12:57.162
Well, let me see what I can do.

12:58.210 --> 13:00.098
What do you mean?

13:00.140 --> 13:03.075
Let me see
what I can do for you.

13:03.110 --> 13:05.271
Okay.

13:05.310 --> 13:07.312
Thanks, Kalinda.

13:10.050 --> 13:13.258
(door opens, closes)

13:13.290 --> 13:14.450
The postnup is clear.

13:14.490 --> 13:16.310
Any actual evidence
of infidelity

13:16.360 --> 13:18.419
by either spouse
invalidates the agreement.

13:18.460 --> 13:19.529
ALICIA:
Actual evidence

13:19.560 --> 13:21.152
means evidence you can admit.

13:21.200 --> 13:22.224
Like this footage
from Mrs. Mercer's

13:22.260 --> 13:24.194
own nanny cam.
Excuse me.

13:24.230 --> 13:26.027
Mrs. Mercer didn't even know
the nanny cam was there.

13:26.070 --> 13:27.196
This evidence can't be admitted.

13:27.240 --> 13:29.128
Simmer down, everybody.

13:29.170 --> 13:31.035
The Illinois privacy law
specifically forbid videotaping

13:31.070 --> 13:32.970
someone in their own house
without their consent.
DAVID: Oh, please.

13:34.380 --> 13:37.008
Who's deaf in here?!

13:37.050 --> 13:38.142
Thank you very much.

13:38.180 --> 13:41.377
So, the videos are
from a nanny cam?

13:41.420 --> 13:43.012
It shows clear as day...

13:43.050 --> 13:44.187
I don't need your
testimony, Mr. Lee.

13:44.220 --> 13:45.983
Just an answer.

13:46.020 --> 13:48.215
Yes, Your Honor.
They had cameras in locations

13:48.260 --> 13:50.478
throughout the house...
Not "they." Him.

13:50.530 --> 13:52.122
Mrs. Mercer didn't even
know they were there.

13:52.160 --> 13:53.627
I don't need yours,
either, Mrs. Florrick.

13:53.660 --> 13:56.299
That's what the
wrtnesses are for.

13:56.330 --> 13:57.888
Do you have a witness?

13:57.930 --> 13:59.522
ALICIA: You had no idea
your husband bought

13:59.570 --> 14:01.094
a home surveillance system?

14:01.140 --> 14:02.061
Absolutely not.

14:02.100 --> 14:04.204
And that he put cameras
all over your house,

14:04.240 --> 14:06.208
including in your bedroom?

14:06.240 --> 14:07.172
He never said a word.

14:07.210 --> 14:08.575
So you had no idea your
private activities

14:08.610 --> 14:09.907
were recorded?

14:09.950 --> 14:11.975
None. _
And you have an expectation

14:12.010 --> 14:13.147
of privacy in your home?

14:13.180 --> 14:15.239
Especially in your bedroom?

14:15.280 --> 14:16.986
Of course I do.

14:17.020 --> 14:18.612
_ Carol asked me
to install the nanny cams.

14:18.650 --> 14:20.481
(Carol scoffs)
DAVID: And when was this?

14:20.520 --> 14:21.987
Right after our son was born.

14:22.020 --> 14:23.658
Why did she want them?

14:23.690 --> 14:25.226
She had an emergency
C-section with Nico,

14:25.260 --> 14:27.228
and she was in bed recovering
for a few weeks.

14:27.260 --> 14:29.228
And since _I'm limited
phy5ically,

14:29.260 --> 14:30.295
we needed help
in the house.

14:30.330 --> 14:32.389
So, your wife wanted to keep
and eye on the help?

14:32.430 --> 14:33.397
Yes.

14:33.440 --> 14:35.465
That was the plan.
But then her mother came.

14:35.500 --> 14:37.331
Don't bring my mother into this!
Mrs. Mercer.

14:37.370 --> 14:39.338
ASHER:
I'm only saying

14:39.370 --> 14:40.678
I bought this high-tech system
and she never used it.

14:40.710 --> 14:43.304
Look, she champions
the use of these things

14:43.350 --> 14:45.045
on-on her mommy blog.

14:45.080 --> 14:47.014
It's not my fault if
one caught her cheating.

14:47.050 --> 14:47.812
In your bed,

14:47.850 --> 14:49.169
in your house.
ALICIA: Objection!

14:49.220 --> 14:50.084
It's a shared home.

14:50.120 --> 14:51.610
Only Mr. Mercer's name
is on the mortgage.

14:51.650 --> 14:52.639
That's a technicality.

14:52.690 --> 14:54.385
Okay, thank you.
Always a pleasure.

14:54.420 --> 14:56.980
I will _decide on this issue
in a few hours.

14:57.030 --> 14:59.590
Do you want to see the video,
Your Honor?

14:59.630 --> 15:01.325
Nicely argued.

15:01.360 --> 15:05.091
Where are you going?

15:11.610 --> 15:13.601
(phones ringing)

15:13.640 --> 15:15.631
WOMAN:
Lockhart/Gardner.

15:39.330 --> 15:41.332
*

16:03.760 --> 16:05.182
ALICIA:
Mr. Polmar? Hello.

16:05.230 --> 16:06.481
Mrs. Florrick.

16:06.530 --> 16:08.691
Hello.
I'm sorry, I had a hard time
getting you on the phone.

16:08.730 --> 16:10.027
My, uh,

16:10.070 --> 16:11.162
assistant thinks
she's d0ing me a favor

16:11.200 --> 16:13.566
by screening my calls,
but unfortunately the only ones

16:13.600 --> 16:15.568
that she lets through
are family members.

16:15.600 --> 16:18.307
Thanks, Maria.

16:18.340 --> 16:20.069
How are you?

16:20.110 --> 16:21.577
Oh, this?

16:21.610 --> 16:23.669
It's very Indiana Jones.

16:25.150 --> 16:27.641
Um...

16:27.680 --> 16:29.409
how close are you
with James Castro?

16:29.450 --> 16:30.246
Jimmy?

16:30.290 --> 16:31.643
Close, why?
Do you need something?

16:31.690 --> 16:33.180
N0, I-I

16:33.220 --> 16:35.313
need to tell you something
in confidence.

16:39.090 --> 16:41.194
The SA. is looking
for a scapegoat

16:41.230 --> 16:44.267
in the Jeffrey Grant
prosecution.

16:44.300 --> 16:47.360
And you are afraid that it's me?

16:47.400 --> 16:48.298
Yes.

16:48.340 --> 16:49.659
Don't worry about it.

16:49.700 --> 16:51.361
Well, he has
an election coming up

16:51.410 --> 16:54.038
and this Grant issue
could haunt him.

16:54.080 --> 16:56.469
Jimmy's an old friend.

16:56.510 --> 16:58.171
I'm known him since law school.

16:58.210 --> 17:00.041
I was best man at his wedding.

17:00.080 --> 17:02.446
He's the one who
dragged me out here.

17:02.480 --> 17:03.708
Okay, good to know.

17:03.750 --> 17:06.480
But... a word of advice.

17:06.520 --> 17:08.317
If he does bring you in
for a casual chat

17:08.360 --> 17:10.157
about the Grant prosecution,

17:10.190 --> 17:11.521
I would call a lavwer.

17:11.560 --> 17:14.324
Okay.

17:14.360 --> 17:15.657
You think I'm being cynical.

17:15.700 --> 17:18.294
No, no. It's just, um...

17:18.330 --> 17:20.434
I have to trust someone.

17:20.470 --> 17:22.461
Especially after this.

17:23.640 --> 17:25.631
You're right.

17:25.670 --> 17:27.228
Well, it was good
to see you again.

17:27.280 --> 17:28.577
You, too.

17:28.610 --> 17:30.703
And if you ever
want to talk.

17:32.380 --> 17:34.371
Thanks, but I'm good.

17:37.820 --> 17:40.380
Alicia?

17:41.590 --> 17:42.716
Mr. State's Attorney.

17:42.760 --> 17:43.749
That sounds odd.

17:43.790 --> 17:45.223
Jimmy's fine.

17:45.260 --> 17:46.420
I never congratulated you

17:46.460 --> 17:47.427
on your appointment, Jimmy.

17:47.460 --> 17:49.155
So, congratulations.

17:49.200 --> 17:50.326
Thanks.
It's a challenge.

17:50.370 --> 17:53.089
But I like challenges.

17:53.140 --> 17:55.700
I was sorry about your old boss.

17:55.740 --> 17:57.662
I liked Will Gardner.
Thank you.

17:57.710 --> 17:59.507
IfI can do anything,
please tell me.

17:59.540 --> 18:01.178
Oh, I will.

18:01.210 --> 18:03.599
And just know I'm doing
everything I can here.

18:03.650 --> 18:05.299
(deep breath)

18:05.350 --> 18:06.669
I always ask myself
what would your husband do

18:06.710 --> 18:08.348
when he was state's attorney?

18:08.380 --> 18:11.110
Then I'd try to do the opposite.

18:11.150 --> 18:12.481
No.

18:12.520 --> 18:15.455
I'm joking. He's a good guy.

18:15.490 --> 18:17.822
Well, good luck, Jimmy.

18:17.860 --> 18:20.328
JUDGE:
I don't know exactly

18:20.360 --> 18:22.157
what's on this nanny cam video,

18:22.200 --> 18:24.259
but I do know this.

18:24.300 --> 18:26.393
The Court's interest in ruling

18:26.430 --> 18:27.897
on the viability of this postnup

18:27.940 --> 18:29.896
is not as great
as Mrs. Mercer's privacy.

18:29.940 --> 18:31.464
DAVID:
Your Honor, ifI may...

18:31.510 --> 18:32.534
You may not.

18:32.570 --> 18:35.505
I forthwith enter
a six-month separation order.

18:35.540 --> 18:37.701
Now?
If Mr. and Mrs. Mercer
can't work this out

18:37.750 --> 18:39.445
over the next half year...
Your Honor, a new issue

18:39.480 --> 18:41.345
has come to our attention.
Oh, really?

18:41.380 --> 18:42.449
Just now? My goodness.

18:42.480 --> 18:44.516
My client would like to file
an emergency petition

18:44.550 --> 18:46.211
for full custody of his son.

18:46.250 --> 18:47.456
What?
Sit down.

18:47.490 --> 18:49.481
On what grounds?
Child endangerment.

18:49.520 --> 18:50.828
Carol is the primary caretaker.

18:50.860 --> 18:52.418
That's the emergency.
This video will prove

18:52.460 --> 18:54.496
that Carol Mercer
is an unﬁt mother.

18:54.530 --> 18:55.349
Your Honor, you already ruled

18:55.400 --> 18:56.651
the nanny cam recording
inadmissible.

18:56.700 --> 18:58.429
Only as to viability
of the postnup.

18:58.470 --> 19:00.495
But child welfare
trumps privacy.

19:00.540 --> 19:02.895
I'm sorry, Your Honor,
but I fail to see

19:02.940 --> 19:04.908
even if the video shows

19:04.940 --> 19:06.601
what Mr. Mercer contends,

19:06.640 --> 19:08.403
how that would endanger
their child.

19:08.440 --> 19:10.305
I'll be happy to show you.
CARY: Your Honor,
this is a ploy.

19:10.350 --> 19:12.602
A way for you to see evidence
that you already

19:12.650 --> 19:14.470
ruled inadmissible.
Yeah, sorry.

19:14.520 --> 19:17.444
But if we're talking about
the best interests of a child,

19:17.490 --> 19:19.412
I'm looking at everything.

19:19.450 --> 19:21.486
The video's admissible.

19:21.520 --> 19:24.751
Just don't make a meal
of it, Mr. Lee.

19:24.790 --> 19:26.781
(passionate moaning)

19:31.630 --> 19:33.268
Sit up.

19:33.300 --> 19:35.461
And don't look
embarrassed, okay?

19:39.640 --> 19:41.631
BOY: Mama?

19:47.650 --> 19:49.515
Okay, got it.

19:49.550 --> 19:51.381
(passionate moaning stops)

19:51.420 --> 19:53.308
I'll hear testimony
on Professor Mercer's petition

19:53.360 --> 19:54.179
for full custody.

19:54.220 --> 19:56.359
ALICIA:
Your Honor, what the video shows

19:56.390 --> 19:58.585
is unfortunate, but it
doesn't rise to the level

19:58.630 --> 19:59.654
of child endangerment.
The video constitutes

19:59.690 --> 20:01.624
a facial showing
of irresponsibility

20:01.660 --> 20:03.594
on the part of Mrs. Mercer.

20:03.630 --> 20:05.359
Anthony and I have been
friends for years.

20:05.400 --> 20:07.334
And it only happened once.
So you say.

20:07.370 --> 20:09.395
I'll hear testimony on
Professor Mercer's petition

20:09.440 --> 20:10.509
for full custody.

20:10.540 --> 20:13.202
(gavelbangs)

20:15.380 --> 20:16.369
Alicia?
Yeah.

20:16.410 --> 20:19.140
Always nice to see how
Lockhart/Gardner works.

20:23.020 --> 20:24.339
(knocking)

20:24.390 --> 20:25.516
(footsteps approaching)

20:29.660 --> 20:31.651
Kalinda, I'm...

20:34.760 --> 20:36.751
*

21:06.060 --> 21:08.255
*

21:27.050 --> 21:29.575
(exhales)

21:39.360 --> 21:40.622
ASHER:
When I'm in town,

21:40.660 --> 21:42.491
I make sure
to be home

21:42.530 --> 21:44.623
to tuck him in.

21:44.670 --> 21:46.467
I... wheel up next to his bed

21:46.500 --> 21:47.592
and read to him.

21:47.640 --> 21:48.493
And when you aren't in town?

21:48.540 --> 21:49.996
He's always on my mind.

21:50.040 --> 21:51.439
DAVID:
Thank you.

21:51.470 --> 21:54.030
No further questions.

21:54.080 --> 21:55.672
Let me cross.
Why?

21:55.710 --> 21:57.007
Because
I have this.

21:57.040 --> 21:57.972
Professor Mercer,

21:58.010 --> 22:00.103
would you describe yourself
as a materialist?

22:00.150 --> 22:01.447
Excuse me?

22:01.480 --> 22:02.447
Your book,

22:02.480 --> 22:04.118
The Philosophy
of Materialism,

22:04.150 --> 22:06.448
describes you as an
empirical materialist.

22:06.490 --> 22:07.855
I'm just wondering
if it's accurate.

22:07.890 --> 22:09.050
Uh, yes, that's a...

22:09.090 --> 22:11.684
a general term for
the philosophy I teach.

22:11.730 --> 22:12.856
The basic
contention of which

22:12.890 --> 22:15.051
is all humans are
a collection of atoms?

22:15.100 --> 22:17.796
That's a very simplistic
view of it.

22:17.830 --> 22:18.797
Give me

22:18.830 --> 22:21.139
the non-simplistic view.

22:21.170 --> 22:22.637
Do we have three hours?

22:22.670 --> 22:24.069
Yes.

22:26.640 --> 22:29.074
The basic contention

22:29.110 --> 22:30.748
of empirical science

22:30.780 --> 22:33.044
is that the universe

22:33.080 --> 22:34.377
is knowable.

22:34.420 --> 22:35.910
And we are all
made up of

22:35.950 --> 22:36.746
physical matter.

22:36.780 --> 22:38.589
Including the human
consciousness?

22:38.620 --> 22:39.917
ASHER:
Of course.

22:39.950 --> 22:40.712
ALICIA:
Including whatever
emotions we feel?

22:40.760 --> 22:42.648
Objection, Your Honor.
I'm at a loss

22:42.690 --> 22:44.749
for what this has
to do with... anything.

22:44.790 --> 22:46.087
ALICIA:
The subject
of this hearing

22:46.130 --> 22:47.154
is custody.

22:47.190 --> 22:49.158
Professor Mercer argued
that he was a good parent,

22:49.200 --> 22:50.929
and that my client
was a bad parent,

22:50.970 --> 22:52.119
based on the activities
he videotaped.

22:52.170 --> 22:54.092
I am just trying to figure out

22:54.140 --> 22:55.892
the components of
his good parenting.

22:55.940 --> 22:58.431
By questioning his teachings?
ALICIA:
Yes.

22:58.470 --> 22:59.835
JUDGE:
Get specific fast, counselor,

22:59.870 --> 23:02.430
unless you want
the objection sustained.

23:02.480 --> 23:04.141
Thank you, Your Honor.
Professor,

23:04.180 --> 23:05.772
do you believe
that free will

23:05.810 --> 23:06.777
is a fiction?

23:06.810 --> 23:07.845
ASHER:
No.

23:07.880 --> 23:08.847
I...
ALICIA:
"Chapter two: On Choice.

23:08.880 --> 23:10.142
"The physical interaction

23:10.180 --> 23:11.112
"of our atoms

23:11.150 --> 23:13.414
"is the sine qua non
of thoughts, feelings,

23:13.460 --> 23:15.416
"actions._
We may believe

23:15.460 --> 23:16.188
"we have free will,

23:16.220 --> 23:18.859
"but it is, in fact,
the illusion

23:18.890 --> 23:21.597
of free will."

23:21.630 --> 23:22.756
Did you write that?

23:22.800 --> 23:25.064
That is the position
I take in my book.

23:25.100 --> 23:27.159
So it's not really
a position you believe,

23:27.200 --> 23:28.690
the illusion of free will?

23:28.740 --> 23:30.958
Well, y-you're taking
my positions from a book

23:31.010 --> 23:32.830
and suggesting...
That's how you'll
bring up your son, yes.

23:32.870 --> 23:34.132
Do you believe in
right and wrong?

23:34.180 --> 23:35.932
Of course.

23:35.980 --> 23:37.948
In what way do you believe
in right and wrong?

23:37.980 --> 23:39.208
Objection.
Asked and answered.

23:39.250 --> 23:41.013
No, not really.

23:41.050 --> 23:43.075
You may answer.

23:43.120 --> 23:44.212
ALICIA:
Do you believe in
right and wrong, Professor?

23:44.250 --> 23:46.218
If your son shoplifted a soda

23:46.250 --> 23:47.512
from a grocery store,

23:47.560 --> 23:50.120
why would
that be wrong?

23:50.160 --> 23:52.856
Because it would impact
the grocer's business.

23:52.890 --> 23:54.118
ALICIA:
But why is that bad?

23:54.160 --> 23:56.151
If the grocer is
made up of a
collection of atoms,

23:56.200 --> 23:57.599
why does
that matter?

24:00.740 --> 24:03.607
Because it's wrong
to hurt people.

24:03.640 --> 24:04.766
Really?

24:04.810 --> 24:05.765
Objection.

24:05.810 --> 24:06.834
That time,
asked and answered.

24:06.870 --> 24:07.700
JUDGE:
Sustained.

24:07.740 --> 24:10.846
Your Honor, may we take
a short recess?

24:10.880 --> 24:13.178
So things, uh...
settled down for you yet?

24:13.210 --> 24:14.814
CASTRO:
A bit.

24:14.850 --> 24:16.511
State A.G. keeps pushing

24:16.550 --> 24:18.643
for a timeline on
the Jeffrey Grant case.

24:18.690 --> 24:19.941
Why?

24:19.990 --> 24:21.218
Just...
bureaucracy.

24:21.260 --> 24:23.012
They don't get what we do here.

24:23.060 --> 24:24.823
Hmm.

24:24.860 --> 24:27.181
Could you put that
together for me?

24:27.230 --> 24:28.549
Yeah.

24:28.600 --> 24:29.419
Sure.
Thanks.

24:29.460 --> 24:30.961
Hey, when did you
drop the professor

24:31.000 --> 24:32.524
as a suspect, by the way?

24:35.770 --> 24:36.896
When did I?

24:36.940 --> 24:38.259
Well...

24:38.310 --> 24:40.460
when was he dropped?

24:42.010 --> 24:42.977
I don't know.

24:43.010 --> 24:44.500
Let me, uh...

24:44.550 --> 24:45.278
let me take a look back.

24:45.310 --> 24:46.572
Great.

24:49.680 --> 24:51.511
Hey, we're okay, right?

24:54.290 --> 24:55.848
Nothing.

24:55.890 --> 24:57.209
I'll talk to you later.

24:57.260 --> 24:59.524
(chuckling):
All right.

25:04.300 --> 25:05.289
Maria, can you get me the number

25:05.330 --> 25:07.127
for Alicia Florrick
at Florrick-Agos, please?

25:07.170 --> 25:08.535
Thank you.

25:09.970 --> 25:11.961
How did you know
I was off today?

25:12.970 --> 25:14.176
Luclq guess.

25:18.150 --> 25:19.242
Shouldn't you
be working?

25:23.320 --> 25:24.981
What happened with
Jeffrey Grant?

25:25.020 --> 25:26.578
Jenna”.

25:26.620 --> 25:27.882
Okay.

25:50.650 --> 25:52.072
When we left off,
Professor,

25:52.110 --> 25:53.919
you said
you believed

25:53.950 --> 25:55.110
in right
and wrong,

25:55.150 --> 25:56.640
and that it was wrong
to hurt people.

25:56.680 --> 25:58.841
Professor?

25:58.890 --> 26:01.950
I said that this was
a custody hearing.

26:01.990 --> 26:04.254
My scientific materialism
doesn't apply here.

26:04.290 --> 26:05.689
"Chapter five: On Morality.

26:05.730 --> 26:07.652
"Humans create value systems

26:07.700 --> 26:08.928
"to organize the world.

26:08.960 --> 26:11.622
"Pleasure is good,
pain is bad.

26:11.670 --> 26:13.297
"Charity is good,
murder is bad.

26:13.330 --> 26:14.297
"But they
are random

26:14.340 --> 26:17.298
and, in fact,
meaningless."

26:17.340 --> 26:18.659
Do you not believe this?

26:20.710 --> 26:22.302
Professor?

26:22.340 --> 26:24.649
I do.
DIANE:
Your Honor,

26:24.680 --> 26:25.977
objection.

26:26.010 --> 26:27.307
Mrs. Florric_k has
a new guest in court.

26:27.350 --> 26:28.612
Who is it?

26:28.650 --> 26:29.969
Counselor?
ALICIA:
Yes, Your Honor.

26:30.020 --> 26:31.817
It's Professor Thomas Nile.

26:31.850 --> 26:33.181
He's the leading
non-materialist

26:33.220 --> 26:34.619
and Professor
Mercer's rival.

26:34.660 --> 26:35.615
Welcome, sir.

26:35.660 --> 26:36.615
ALICIA:
So, Professor,

26:36.660 --> 26:38.082
you believe your son, Nico,

26:38.130 --> 26:40.257
is nothing more than
a product of his atoms?

26:41.960 --> 26:44.622
My son is a glorious result

26:44.670 --> 26:46.126
of the miracle
of nature.

26:46.170 --> 26:47.319
ALICIA:
Yes.

26:47.370 --> 26:49.964
Which means...
a product of his atoms?

26:50.970 --> 26:52.631
Yes.

26:53.680 --> 26:55.636
ALICIA:
So when he dies,

26:55.680 --> 26:56.874
what remains
of him?

26:56.910 --> 26:59.640
He's gone.

26:59.680 --> 27:02.012
When someone dies,

27:02.050 --> 27:03.915
there's nothing

27:03.950 --> 27:06.282
left of them?

27:06.320 --> 27:07.787
ASHER:
That's why

27:07.820 --> 27:09.754
I plan to value

27:09.790 --> 27:12.281
every moment with my son.

27:12.330 --> 27:13.797
I will hold him

27:13.830 --> 27:15.718
and love him

27:15.760 --> 27:17.057
and teach him.

27:17.100 --> 27:19.091
But to what end?

27:20.270 --> 27:21.396
Why?

27:28.710 --> 27:30.701
(gasping)

28:07.780 --> 28:09.077
Hey.

28:09.120 --> 28:11.714
(music shuts off)

28:15.190 --> 28:16.214
How's Grace?

28:16.260 --> 28:18.854
She's good.

28:18.890 --> 28:20.187
You're very brave out there.

28:20.230 --> 28:22.425
Thanks.
(giggles)

28:22.460 --> 28:24.724
I got arrested
at Wrigley Field.

28:24.770 --> 28:26.260
That was
pretty cool.

28:30.540 --> 28:32.360
I think I made a mistake.

28:32.410 --> 28:33.900
What mistake?

28:35.910 --> 28:38.799
Being a lavwer.

28:38.850 --> 28:42.741
You don't
like it?

28:42.780 --> 28:44.213
No.

28:44.250 --> 28:46.389
I don't know.
Sometimes I do.

28:46.420 --> 28:48.058
What would you do instead?

28:50.090 --> 28:52.081
I have no idea.

28:53.090 --> 28:54.853
I Wish I did.

28:54.900 --> 28:56.959
Do you want to dance with me?

28:59.070 --> 29:01.493
No.

29:04.940 --> 29:06.931
I think I'm going home now.

29:30.130 --> 29:32.098
ZACH:
Mom. Mom...

29:34.140 --> 29:36.461
Diane Lockhart's
on the phone.

29:36.500 --> 29:38.468
GRACE:
And you missed
a few other calls, too.

29:41.840 --> 29:43.068
Hello?

29:43.110 --> 29:45.271
I'm, uh, sorry to call you
at home, Alicia,

29:45.310 --> 29:46.971
but you weren't
picking up your cell

29:47.010 --> 29:48.819
and your office
didn't know where you were.

29:48.850 --> 29:50.010
It's okay.

29:50.050 --> 29:51.483
Um... things are moving

29:51.520 --> 29:54.887
quickly here, and I don't
want us to lose momentum.

29:54.920 --> 29:56.251
I just need to know if we're...

29:56.290 --> 29:58.121
if we're still talking merger.

29:58.160 --> 29:59.229
Can I call you back?

29:59.260 --> 30:00.227
Well, Alicia,

30:00.260 --> 30:01.352
if you're trying
to leverage this

30:01.400 --> 30:02.355
to get a better deal...

30:02.400 --> 30:04.391
No.

30:04.430 --> 30:06.125
I can't, uh...

30:08.270 --> 30:10.158
I'm a little under the weather.

30:10.200 --> 30:11.906
Let's talk when
I'm feeling better.

30:11.940 --> 30:13.168
Well, Alicia, can...

30:13.210 --> 30:15.201
(line clicks)

30:16.880 --> 30:17.869
Mom, are you okay?

30:17.910 --> 30:19.878
Yeah, you want us to get
you a NyQuil or something?

30:19.910 --> 30:21.047
I don't know.

30:21.080 --> 30:22.047
ZACH:
I'll get you a NyQuil.

30:22.080 --> 30:24.048
Could you make her tea?
Yeah.

30:24.090 --> 30:25.819
(footsteps receding)

30:40.170 --> 30:43.059
Well, very good.

30:43.100 --> 30:45.136
You know, this job is
like building track

30:45.170 --> 30:46.262
in front of a
bullet train.

30:46.310 --> 30:48.073
You ready?

30:48.110 --> 30:49.907
Yeah, absolutely.

30:49.940 --> 30:51.168
I'm sorry to drag you
through this.

30:51.210 --> 30:52.040
Yeah, no
problem.

30:52.080 --> 30:54.947
So I went back through
the Grant files,

30:54.980 --> 30:56.345
and I found a
bunch of e-mails

30:56.380 --> 30:58.348
about the professor,
Delaney,

30:58.390 --> 30:59.618
rejecting him
as a suspect.

30:59.650 --> 31:01.186
Uh, when was this?

31:01.220 --> 31:03.313
October.
Okay. Good.

31:03.360 --> 31:05.954
Uh, e-mails between
you and Geneva?

31:05.990 --> 31:07.150
No, between you and me.

31:07.190 --> 31:09.090
Really?

31:09.130 --> 31:10.392
Yeah.

31:10.430 --> 31:12.364
I guess you thought
Professor Delaney's alibi

31:12.400 --> 31:14.197
was a little bit dodgy,

31:14.240 --> 31:15.229
but then Jeffrey Grant's name
POPPEd UP

31:15.270 --> 31:18.000
and all those concerns
just disappeared, so...

31:18.040 --> 31:19.268
I'll have to go through
my records.

31:19.310 --> 31:21.232
Yeah.

31:21.280 --> 31:23.202
That's a good idea.

31:23.240 --> 31:25.470
You know what _
we're trying to do here, Finn?

31:25.510 --> 31:27.171
We're trying to bring
something to Chicago

31:27.210 --> 31:28.472
that it's never seen.

31:28.520 --> 31:31.182
A state's attorney's office
that is fair.

31:31.220 --> 31:35.156
Fair in prosecution,
investigation and sentencing.

31:36.160 --> 31:37.411
That's why I'm here.

31:37.460 --> 31:40.088
Good.

31:40.130 --> 31:41.950
One of these days,
I'm gonna need your help.

31:42.000 --> 31:43.649
With...
If I don't get elected

31:43.700 --> 31:46.362
next year, this office will go
right back to what it was.

31:47.370 --> 31:49.133
Yeah, okay.

31:49.170 --> 31:51.161
I'll talk to you.

32:03.750 --> 32:05.945
(groans softly)

32:20.430 --> 32:22.432
(phones ringing,
indistinct chatter nearby)

32:35.050 --> 32:36.972
To what do I owe the pleasure?

32:42.260 --> 32:44.421
What's this?
It's a copy

32:44.460 --> 32:46.189
of a retainer agreement
for a new client

32:46.230 --> 32:47.026
that Diane just signed.

32:47.060 --> 32:49.153
And she thinks
this will save her?

32:49.200 --> 32:50.349
I think she does.

32:50.400 --> 32:52.368
William Donnelly?

32:52.400 --> 32:55.198
Yeah. The Donnelly family

32:55.240 --> 32:57.765
has one of the big
import-export businesses

32:57.800 --> 33:00.064
in your old neighborhood.

33:00.110 --> 33:02.101
Diane really wanted
to represent them,

33:02.140 --> 33:04.608
so she offered them a discount
to come aboard.

33:04.650 --> 33:07.403
She...

33:07.450 --> 33:09.270
Come-come on board here?

33:09.320 --> 33:11.140
Mm-hmm. Lockhart/Gardner.

33:11.190 --> 33:13.283
Our newest client.

33:14.290 --> 33:15.484
She can't.

33:15.520 --> 33:16.612
It's done.

33:16.660 --> 33:18.651
A copy
of the retainer agreement

33:18.690 --> 33:21.250
is already in the mail
to a friend of yours.

33:21.300 --> 33:23.256
Liam Gerraghty?

33:23.300 --> 33:26.121
His organization has had
quite a few disagreements

33:26.170 --> 33:27.728
with Mr. Donnelly
over the years,

33:27.770 --> 33:31.501
all of which have been sorted
with some struggle.

33:31.540 --> 33:35.078
I wonder how Mr. Gerraghty
will view your firm

33:35.110 --> 33:36.634
representing his competition.

33:44.850 --> 33:47.444
So how did you find out
about me and the Gerraghtys?

33:47.490 --> 33:50.812
The copy was sent
by express mail, by the way.

33:50.860 --> 33:54.296
So unless you fancy
explaining yourself,

33:54.330 --> 33:57.049
you have about 18 hours
to quit the firm.

33:59.430 --> 34:01.534
Good-bye, Damian.

34:02.570 --> 34:06.028
(sighs)

34:08.280 --> 34:09.804
(sirens wailing,
indistinct radio transmission)

34:09.840 --> 34:12.400
MAN: People just think there
are black hats and white hats,

34:12.450 --> 34:16.409
but there are black hats
with white linings.

34:17.420 --> 34:20.082
White hats...

34:20.120 --> 34:23.578
with black linings.

34:23.620 --> 34:26.680
And there are hats that
change back and forth

34:26.730 --> 34:30.655
between white and black.

34:31.670 --> 34:33.194
And there are striped hats.

34:33.230 --> 34:35.232
Hey, Mom?

34:37.200 --> 34:40.465
Evil rests in the soul
of all men.
Hey.

34:40.510 --> 34:41.499
Do you want some dinner?

34:41.540 --> 34:43.201
I'm all right.

34:43.240 --> 34:44.571
You sure?

34:44.610 --> 34:45.872
You should probably
just eat something.

34:45.910 --> 34:48.117
It haunts them like ghosts
I will later.

34:48.150 --> 34:49.469
haunt a graveyard.

34:49.520 --> 34:52.239
And there is nothing you can do

34:52.290 --> 34:55.214
but curse God.

34:59.490 --> 35:01.458
CARY:
Thank you both

35:01.500 --> 35:02.626
for agreeing to sit down.

35:02.660 --> 35:04.469
DAVID: Make it quick;
I have work to do.

35:04.500 --> 35:05.626
Um, where's Alicia?

35:05.670 --> 35:07.126
Oh, she asked me
to step in for her.

35:07.170 --> 35:08.660
(sighs)
We're prepared

35:08.700 --> 35:10.292
to compromise on the
divorce settlement.

35:10.340 --> 35:11.364
We're not.

35:11.410 --> 35:12.809
David,

35:12.840 --> 35:14.705
both our clients
have been bloodied here,

35:14.740 --> 35:17.538
and there's no way to predict
which way the judge will go.

35:17.580 --> 35:19.605
Professor Mercer will honor
the terms of the postnup

35:19.650 --> 35:21.345
regarding child support
and alimony.

35:21.380 --> 35:23.245
In return, our client
will grant him a swift

35:23.280 --> 35:25.248
and uncontested divorce
so he can remarry.

35:25.290 --> 35:26.382
It's a win-win.

35:26.420 --> 35:28.217
Here's my counter.
No proceeds

35:28.260 --> 35:30.285
for the book,
no alimony,

35:30.320 --> 35:31.753
massive reduction
in child support,

35:31.790 --> 35:33.587
or you can get the hell
out of here.

35:33.630 --> 35:36.758
Your proposal is accepted, Cary.

35:36.800 --> 35:39.462
Diane, a word?

35:43.770 --> 35:45.499
I don't know what you
think you're doing.

35:45.540 --> 35:47.508
I'm making
an executive decision.

35:47.540 --> 35:49.303
I'm the ranking
partner here.

35:49.340 --> 35:51.171
Not for long; I have the votes.

35:51.210 --> 35:53.201
You had them.
You just lost one.

35:54.250 --> 35:55.547
What?

35:55.580 --> 35:56.911
You lost one vote.

35:56.950 --> 35:58.941
You'll have a hard time
finding your friend Damian

35:58.990 --> 36:00.787
for tomorrow's
partner meeting

36:00.820 --> 36:01.957
or any other one.

36:01.990 --> 36:04.288
You think I'm bluffing, hmm?

36:04.330 --> 36:05.479
Go. Check.

36:05.530 --> 36:07.657
You make a deal with Alicia,

36:07.690 --> 36:09.658
half the partners will rebel.
I make a deal

36:09.700 --> 36:11.918
with Alicia and bring
Chumhum back into the tent,

36:11.970 --> 36:13.562
half the partners
will be too busy

36:13.600 --> 36:15.898
counting their bonus money.

36:15.940 --> 36:18.363
You're no Will Gardner, Diane.

36:18.410 --> 36:20.469
You'll only hurt yourself
trying to be.

36:20.510 --> 36:21.602
(chuckles)

36:21.640 --> 36:23.574
Well, then fasten
your seat belts.

36:23.610 --> 36:25.771
We're heading for a lot of hurt.

36:37.420 --> 36:38.682
(tires squealing)

36:53.010 --> 36:54.773
(car door opens)

36:54.810 --> 36:57.438
(car door closes,
engine rewing)

36:57.480 --> 37:00.278
MAN (on TV):
Pigs in mud,

37:00.310 --> 37:01.311
that's all we are.

37:01.350 --> 37:02.612
(doorbell rings, door opens)

37:02.650 --> 37:03.912
God looks down on us

37:03.950 --> 37:05.611
and all he sees is mud
POLMAR: Sorry to bother you.

37:05.650 --> 37:08.448
_ and more mud. _
I just need to ask a question.

37:08.490 --> 37:09.912
(turns off TV)
I'm a client of your mom's.

37:09.960 --> 37:11.427
GRACE:
Oh, I'm sorry.

37:11.460 --> 37:12.654
She's really sick right now.

37:12.690 --> 37:14.658
Grace, it's okay.

37:14.700 --> 37:16.691
POLMAR:
Thank you.

37:18.530 --> 37:20.259
(clears throat)

37:23.800 --> 37:24.835
Hey.

37:24.870 --> 37:26.030
You okay?

37:26.070 --> 37:28.607
I'm so sorry. There's...

37:28.640 --> 37:30.733
no excuse for missing
your meeting.

37:30.780 --> 37:32.407
No, no, please.

37:32.450 --> 37:34.918
If you're... sick, you're sick.

37:34.950 --> 37:36.611
I should've called.

37:36.650 --> 37:38.789
No, it's okay.

37:40.090 --> 37:41.785
I just need to know,

37:41.820 --> 37:42.980
should I be hiring
another lavwer?

37:43.020 --> 37:44.282
No, no.

37:44.330 --> 37:46.651
I... Ijust...

37:46.690 --> 37:48.726
I needed a day.

37:48.760 --> 37:51.661
I just needed to sort
through a few things.

37:51.700 --> 37:53.429
I'll be well.

37:54.900 --> 37:57.460
Will really mattered to you.

38:01.940 --> 38:03.771
Yes.

38:03.810 --> 38:05.346
Look, um,

38:05.380 --> 38:07.371
uh...

38:10.520 --> 38:12.841
My wife and I lost a child

38:12.890 --> 38:14.881
in a miscarriage.

38:17.860 --> 38:19.680
It doesn't get solved quickly,

38:19.730 --> 38:22.699
and you can't just shake it off.

38:22.730 --> 38:26.689
So, if there's
anything I can do...

38:26.730 --> 38:28.834
Thanks.

38:28.870 --> 38:30.735
I mean, I know people
always say that,

38:30.770 --> 38:32.704
but, um,

38:32.740 --> 38:33.809
I mean it.

38:33.840 --> 38:36.502
I know you do.

38:36.540 --> 38:39.771
All right.

38:39.810 --> 38:41.812
I'll see you soon.

38:43.380 --> 38:44.813
(door opens)

38:45.790 --> 38:47.678
Hello.

38:47.720 --> 38:49.449
Hi.

38:49.490 --> 38:50.787
I'm Finn Polmar.

38:50.820 --> 38:51.787
Huh.

38:51.830 --> 38:53.024
I'm Peter Florrick.

38:53.060 --> 38:54.493
Yes, the governor, I know.

38:54.530 --> 38:55.599
I voted for you.

38:55.630 --> 38:57.393
That's good to know.

38:57.430 --> 38:58.522
Uh, your wife

38:58.570 --> 38:59.821
was just helping me with a case.

38:59.870 --> 39:01.792
Well, then you're
in great hands.

39:01.840 --> 39:04.434
Yeah. Yeah.

39:16.780 --> 39:18.782
(sniffles)

39:19.750 --> 39:21.115
You okay?

39:21.150 --> 39:22.879
I really wish everyone
would stop asking me that.

39:22.920 --> 39:23.989
I'm fine.

39:24.020 --> 39:25.885
Oh.

39:25.930 --> 39:29.388
You missed the Founders' Dinner.

39:29.430 --> 39:31.898
I just was worried
about you.

39:31.930 --> 39:33.158
Sorry.

39:33.200 --> 39:35.896
I don't often ask you to come
to these, uh, political events.

39:35.940 --> 39:37.828
I'll go to the next one.

39:38.870 --> 39:40.804
Alicia,

39:40.840 --> 39:43.809
the way you're handling
this Will thing...

39:43.840 --> 39:45.501
I'm doing...

39:45.550 --> 39:46.505
my best.

39:46.550 --> 39:48.541
Oh, well, if this is your best,

39:48.580 --> 39:49.979
then I think we need to talk.

39:55.120 --> 39:57.111
Look, you lost a friend.

39:58.890 --> 40:01.188
You didn't lose your child;
you didn't lose your husband.

40:01.230 --> 40:04.529
I lost my husband
a long time ago.

40:04.570 --> 40:07.130
Oh, my...

40:07.170 --> 40:10.560
You cannot go back there.

40:10.600 --> 40:11.828
I don't have to.

40:11.870 --> 40:14.134
I'm still living it every day.

40:14.170 --> 40:15.603
(under breath):
Oh, my God.

40:15.640 --> 40:19.098
How many times
do I have to tell you?

40:19.150 --> 40:21.641
When I cheated,
it didn't mean anything.

40:21.680 --> 40:23.045
Well, then that was a waste,

40:23.080 --> 40:25.617
because when I cheated,
it did!

40:25.650 --> 40:28.619
Well, I can't compete
with a dead man,

40:28.660 --> 40:29.809
but if you think your life

40:29.860 --> 40:31.487
would've been better with Will,
you are kidding yourself.

40:31.530 --> 40:33.521
Stop it, Peter!
No, I'm not gonna

40:33.560 --> 40:34.959
let you throw away
this marriage

40:35.000 --> 40:36.820
because you have some
idealized notion

40:36.860 --> 40:39.169
of a man who you're not
even sure cared about you!

40:39.200 --> 40:40.462
You're a bastard.

40:40.500 --> 40:41.535
And you're a selfish bitch,

40:41.570 --> 40:43.231
but you know what?!

40:43.270 --> 40:45.500
We're all that we have.

40:49.940 --> 40:52.670
(sighs)

40:58.920 --> 41:01.559
No.

41:01.590 --> 41:03.581
Not anymore.

41:09.060 --> 41:10.550
Don't worry;
I'm not gonna divorce you.

41:10.600 --> 41:12.693
You're to valuable
to me profe55ionally,

41:12.730 --> 41:13.867
just like I am to you.

41:13.900 --> 41:16.630
But we're not gonna see
each other anymore.

41:16.670 --> 41:19.059
Not unless we have to.

41:19.110 --> 41:20.964
If you need me
at a political event,

41:21.010 --> 41:22.500
you call the office.

41:22.540 --> 41:23.939
My assistant will put it
on my calendar.

41:23.980 --> 41:25.641
Really?

41:25.680 --> 41:26.749
I'm not finished.

41:26.780 --> 41:28.919
You are free...

41:28.950 --> 41:31.646
to see and sleep
with whomever you like,

41:31.690 --> 41:33.089
but I don't want to know,

41:33.120 --> 41:35.554
and under no circumstances

41:35.590 --> 41:37.717
are our children to know.

41:37.760 --> 41:39.751
Understood?

41:43.730 --> 41:45.891
Is this because you want
to sleep with someone else?

41:45.930 --> 41:48.125
Get out of my house, Peter.

41:48.170 --> 41:50.695
Get...

42:05.150 --> 42:08.586
This is David Lee
at Lockhart/Gardner.

42:08.620 --> 42:11.157
Do you have a minute? Uh-huh.

42:11.190 --> 42:13.727
What do you think
about a merger?

42:13.760 --> 42:16.058
What do I think?

42:16.100 --> 42:17.727
I think...

42:17.760 --> 42:18.829
that sounds interesting.
