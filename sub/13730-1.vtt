03:03.766 --> 03:05.222
Petey.

03:07.770 --> 03:08.520
Where'd he go?

03:10.857 --> 03:13.064
He must have went that-a-way.

03:14.861 --> 03:16.692
Petey.

03:18.239 --> 03:19.979
|'|| wring his neck!

03:21.284 --> 03:22.990
Petey.

03:24.162 --> 03:26.198
Petey.

03:26.664 --> 03:28.450
Elliott, put me down.

03:32.295 --> 03:33.626
Spread out!

03:35.131 --> 03:37.838
They're getting closer. We better hide.

03:49.896 --> 03:53.184
Stop swinging your tail.
You almost knocked me down.

03:58.196 --> 03:59.732
Here they come.

04:06.955 --> 04:08.320
Squish down!

04:19.717 --> 04:22.424
Petey.

04:24.472 --> 04:26.087
No, don't!

04:37.819 --> 04:40.561
Something hit me!

04:42.365 --> 04:45.528
-What something?
-lfl knowed what something,

04:45.576 --> 04:49.194
I wouldn't call it "something,"
I'd call it by its name.

04:50.039 --> 04:52.451
I told you not to swing your tail.

04:55.336 --> 04:56.837
No, no, don't!

05:08.683 --> 05:10.139
You done it!

05:11.936 --> 05:13.472
Dumb polecats!

05:15.148 --> 05:19.266
Fighting it out while that little snake
of a kid gets further away!

05:20.570 --> 05:25.030
Now why are y'all playing in the mud
when you know we gotta find that boy?

05:25.074 --> 05:29.238
He's gotta be around here somewhere.
Find him!

05:29.287 --> 05:35.078
Aw, Ma! Why don't we just go on
back home and do some eating?

05:35.168 --> 05:37.750
I'll tell you, 'cause you
ain't gonna do no eating

05:37.795 --> 05:40.081
until you find that little brat!

05:42.175 --> 05:43.665
Who done that?

05:48.723 --> 05:52.716
Hey, Ma, why don't we just
get ourselves another orphan, huh?

05:52.769 --> 05:56.261
Because I done paid
our last $50 for Pete,

05:56.356 --> 05:58.563
plus 50 cents legal fees.

05:58.608 --> 06:02.100
And we ain't got another
$50 plus |ega|, that's why!

06:02.195 --> 06:06.404
Do you understand? Well, here's
something you will understand.

06:06.449 --> 06:10.613
You're gonna have to start working
the farm with your own two hands

06:10.661 --> 06:13.152
less'n you spot that little twerp.

06:13.623 --> 06:17.161
And get me out of
this here mud hole, Merle.

06:17.251 --> 06:19.663
Come on. I'm stuck.
Don'tjust sit around in it.

06:19.754 --> 06:21.836
Come on. Get me out of here.

06:27.428 --> 06:30.511
-Petey! Petey!
-Petey! Petey!

06:30.598 --> 06:34.307
Petey! Petey, Petey, Petey!

06:34.977 --> 06:38.435
We better stay here.
I'm tired, aren't you?

06:41.901 --> 06:43.437
Good night, Elliott.

07:09.595 --> 07:11.005
Hi, Elliott.

07:19.147 --> 07:21.103
Oh, boy. Those look good.

07:29.449 --> 07:30.859
l'm starved.

07:40.710 --> 07:42.701
You sure changed my life.

07:43.963 --> 07:47.126
I didn't think I'd ever be happy
until I met you.

08:11.741 --> 08:15.074
Whoops. One left. You can have it.

08:18.414 --> 08:19.620
Thanks!

08:36.307 --> 08:38.423
You're a good cook, Elliott.

08:43.856 --> 08:48.020
/ look in your eyes
and you whisper sweetly

08:51.906 --> 08:55.945
We don ’t match in size
but we ﬁt so neatly

08:59.956 --> 09:03.949
It’s nice waking up
when you’re close beside me

09:04.043 --> 09:07.956
Humming in my ear

09:10.132 --> 09:11.838
You’re joking

09:11.926 --> 09:13.757
/ can’t believe it

09:14.887 --> 09:16.172
You do?

09:18.641 --> 09:21.849
llove you, too

09:23.980 --> 09:28.144
Remember the night
when you ﬁrst conﬁded

09:32.196 --> 09:35.984
And things went so right
that we both decided

09:40.121 --> 09:44.034
Now we ’re together and life is perfect

09:44.125 --> 09:47.663
Don ’t ever disappear

09:49.672 --> 09:51.128
Oh, really?

09:52.008 --> 09:53.623
Oh, you’re just saying that

09:54.552 --> 09:56.088
Is it true?

09:58.681 --> 10:01.343
llove you, too

10:03.686 --> 10:07.929
We’re walking down a road of our own

10:08.024 --> 10:11.892
Where rain can never fall

10:11.986 --> 10:16.025
I’m glad / don ’t have to be alone

10:23.122 --> 10:27.161
You know what to say
when / want direction

10:31.297 --> 10:35.131
You don ’t turn away
when / need protection

10:39.055 --> 10:43.219
Your voice is the sound
of an angel singing

10:43.267 --> 10:47.180
Music / wait to hear

10:48.814 --> 10:50.315
Say it again

10:50.775 --> 10:52.106
And again

10:53.277 --> 10:55.233
Everything seems so new

10:57.740 --> 10:59.981
llove you, too

11:01.952 --> 11:04.694
llove you, too

11:05.915 --> 11:10.375
llove you, too

11:15.925 --> 11:20.635
llove you, too

11:28.938 --> 11:32.226
Passamaquoddy.
Sounds like a nice place.

11:36.028 --> 11:40.522
Now, Elliott, we want the people
of Passamaquoddy to like us.

11:40.616 --> 11:41.947
Don't we?

11:44.328 --> 11:48.116
I mean, you're kind of big,
and we don't want to scare anyone.

11:48.165 --> 11:49.541
Do we?

11:53.462 --> 11:56.329
So you better not show yourself,
understand?

11:59.719 --> 12:03.632
I know how you feel, but you'll
have to make yourself invisible.

12:13.023 --> 12:14.274
Nope.

12:25.077 --> 12:26.157
Nope.

12:33.169 --> 12:34.284
Nope.

12:38.883 --> 12:41.716
I'm sorry, but the whole thing has to go.

12:47.808 --> 12:49.799
Behave yourself, Elliott.

13:21.091 --> 13:22.080
Hi!

13:39.401 --> 13:41.528
I told you not to fool around.

13:41.570 --> 13:44.277
Get on the sidewalk
and stay next to me.

14:03.259 --> 14:04.920
Look out, Elliott!

14:14.478 --> 14:16.594
Clumsy, clumsy, clumsy.

14:16.647 --> 14:18.512
I'm sorry, real sorry.

14:18.607 --> 14:21.644
l was telling my dragon
not to bump his head on the sign.

14:25.281 --> 14:28.023
All right, smarties. Into your classroom.

14:28.742 --> 14:31.074
March, march, march, march, march!

14:33.163 --> 14:35.028
March!

14:35.124 --> 14:36.113
March!

14:37.042 --> 14:38.327
March!

14:39.003 --> 14:40.038
March!

14:40.129 --> 14:41.289
How dare you?

14:41.380 --> 14:42.881
I mean, how dare you lie

14:42.965 --> 14:44.796
and try to embarrass me
in front of my students?

14:44.842 --> 14:48.551
-I wasn't lying.
-That's a lie on top of a lie.

14:50.681 --> 14:52.421
You're not one of my pupils.

14:52.474 --> 14:54.635
VVhatschool
are you playing hooky from?

14:54.727 --> 14:57.218
I don't go to school.

14:58.606 --> 14:59.595
I knew it.

14:59.690 --> 15:03.023
That's just what this town needs.
Another ignoramus.

15:04.778 --> 15:06.154
No, Elliott.

15:11.410 --> 15:13.901
You disgusting little street urchin!

15:16.832 --> 15:18.993
You could be locked up for this.
Where's the sheriff?

15:19.168 --> 15:22.205
Gentlemen, I propose to say

15:22.296 --> 15:25.163
Passamaquoddy's
a beautiful community

15:25.215 --> 15:29.925
where the sun always rises
and the sun always sets.

15:30.429 --> 15:31.930
Elliott!

15:32.014 --> 15:34.676
It's a place of serenity and security,

15:34.725 --> 15:37.262
where the unexpected never happens.

15:40.189 --> 15:41.804
It's okay, Elliott.

15:41.857 --> 15:44.439
It seems to say, "Welcome!"

15:48.614 --> 15:51.777
You absolute oaf!

15:51.867 --> 15:54.404
You idiot!

15:55.079 --> 15:58.242
Look, it was that kid that pushed me.

15:58.332 --> 16:00.368
He pulled off Miss Taylor's petticoat.

16:00.459 --> 16:02.666
He walked through my cement
with his big feet.

16:02.711 --> 16:04.667
He scared my horse, Victoria.

16:04.713 --> 16:07.170
Let's get out of here, Elliott.

16:07.216 --> 16:10.959
-Well, where is this person?
-There he goes!

16:11.053 --> 16:13.419
Well, detain him. Detain him.

16:30.072 --> 16:31.403
Elliott.

16:32.032 --> 16:33.738
You spoiled everything.

16:36.203 --> 16:37.864
Darn you, Elliott.

16:40.165 --> 16:41.951
I told you to behave.

17:06.400 --> 17:09.858
Scallops. And some oysters.

17:09.945 --> 17:11.981
And...

17:14.116 --> 17:16.607
Hello there, little boy.

17:16.660 --> 17:17.695
Hi.

17:22.833 --> 17:23.868
Hi.

17:25.627 --> 17:29.119
Hey! Hey, you look terrible.

17:31.300 --> 17:36.169
Hey, your friend's turned green.

17:40.017 --> 17:42.429
If I didn't know any better,

17:42.478 --> 17:46.266
I'd say he was a dragon. A...

17:49.568 --> 17:50.899
Dragon!

17:51.820 --> 17:54.277
Elliott, didn't I tell you that...

18:12.299 --> 18:13.880
Gentlemen...

18:14.802 --> 18:18.294
A dragon, a dragon
/ swearl saw a dragon

18:18.347 --> 18:21.839
A green and seething
ﬁre-breathing monster is in sight

18:21.934 --> 18:25.392
With eyes of red, a lion ’3 head
and wings as dark as night

18:25.479 --> 18:29.347
He has a jaw of gleaming teeth
He’s 50 feet in height

18:29.441 --> 18:32.854
It’s true, it’s true. What are we to do?

18:32.903 --> 18:36.487
It’s true, it’s true
He 7/ break us all in two

18:36.532 --> 18:40.616
He ’3 coming in, his great big ﬁn
is right against the door

18:40.702 --> 18:43.444
80 board up all the windows

18:44.123 --> 18:48.241
And get down on the floor

18:48.335 --> 18:50.371
Has anybody seen my dad?

18:52.381 --> 18:54.747
Nora, please, my child, come in.

18:55.926 --> 18:58.258
-Get off that street.
-What's the matter?

18:58.345 --> 19:00.552
Worst thing I ever saw in my life
out there on the street.

19:00.639 --> 19:01.754
What was it?

19:01.849 --> 19:04.386
I don't want to tell you
for fear it'll scare you to death!

19:04.476 --> 19:05.511
Scare me.

19:05.561 --> 19:09.145
A dragon, a dragon
/ swearl saw a dragon

19:09.231 --> 19:12.815
His tail lashing, he’ll be
smashing every shop in town

19:12.901 --> 19:16.393
With scaly feet he’ll crack the street
and tear the steeple down

19:16.488 --> 19:20.231
It’s not some loony dream
/ heard a scream from Sheriff Brown

19:20.284 --> 19:23.742
It’s true, it’s true. What are we to do?

19:23.829 --> 19:25.615
It’s true, it’s true

19:25.706 --> 19:27.492
-Old Lampie’s in a stew
-Old Lampie’s in a stew

19:27.583 --> 19:31.246
A dragon, a dragon
/ swear there was a dragon

19:31.295 --> 19:34.753
You’re off your hinges
All those binges put you in a haze

19:34.840 --> 19:38.424
You crazy fools, it’s all your
doggone fault he’s in a daze

19:38.510 --> 19:42.549
Let go of me, let go of me
and mend your wicked ways

19:45.475 --> 19:48.763
What makes you think
there ever was, there never was

19:48.854 --> 19:52.187
There never, never, ever was
a dragon, dragon, dragon

19:52.274 --> 19:54.356
Dragon, dragon
dragon, dragon, dragon

19:54.443 --> 19:55.979
Dragon, dragon
dragon, dragon, dragon

20:08.832 --> 20:12.040
-Now, why don't you just calm down?
-I seen his face,

20:12.127 --> 20:14.334
if you wanna call it a face.

20:14.421 --> 20:16.662
It was this close to me.

20:16.757 --> 20:18.839
Why don't you lie down, Dad?
Come on.

20:18.926 --> 20:24.341
And you know what else?
It started to smile at me.

20:25.474 --> 20:26.714
Well, did you smile back?

20:26.808 --> 20:30.926
I didn't have time to smile.
I was too busy running.

20:32.272 --> 20:33.261
Sure.

20:34.316 --> 20:37.479
And you know...
And you know what else?

20:37.569 --> 20:39.651
There was this boy with it.

20:40.822 --> 20:42.608
And he wasn't afraid.

20:43.450 --> 20:46.157
-This boy...
-Now, lie down.

22:58.710 --> 23:01.918
We're in a lot of trouble,
and it's all your fault.

23:43.755 --> 23:45.495
I don't wanna play.

23:56.184 --> 23:58.516
You did everything wrong
in Passamaquoddy.

23:58.603 --> 24:00.980
Now everybody hates us.

24:01.022 --> 24:04.185
I don't know whether
you're good for me

24:04.276 --> 24:05.482
orbad.

24:14.870 --> 24:18.954
I'm sorry, Elliott.
I didn't really mean that.

24:19.040 --> 24:23.534
It's just I don't know what to do
and I'm scared.

24:41.438 --> 24:42.928
Hello, in there!

24:43.773 --> 24:45.058
Get back!

24:54.910 --> 24:55.945
Hi.

24:58.079 --> 25:00.070
What are you doing here?

25:01.249 --> 25:03.956
Just playing tic-tac-toe.

25:04.044 --> 25:07.252
Well, this isn't exactly
the best place for tic-tac-toe.

25:07.297 --> 25:11.006
The tide's coming in, and high water
reaches this cave sometimes.

25:11.092 --> 25:13.048
You better head for home.

25:16.848 --> 25:20.011
You're not from Passamaquoddy,
are you?

25:20.101 --> 25:23.468
Nope. Just sort of travelling.

25:25.315 --> 25:27.101
Where are your parents?

25:29.319 --> 25:31.150
Where are you staying?

25:33.281 --> 25:35.613
-What's your name?
-Pete.

25:36.618 --> 25:41.203
l'm Nora, and l have to get back
on watch, up in the lighthouse.

25:41.289 --> 25:44.452
There's chowder on the stove
if you'd like some.

25:52.467 --> 25:56.301
What's the matter?
It's a hand, not a shark.

25:58.223 --> 26:00.464
You can finish that chowder,

26:03.812 --> 26:05.473
if you'd like.

26:21.204 --> 26:23.820
I forgot something. Be right back.

26:29.170 --> 26:31.035
I forgive you, Elliott.

26:42.559 --> 26:46.143
Stay here till I see what
it's like up in the lighthouse.

26:57.949 --> 27:00.031
The Gogans own me, I guess.

27:00.118 --> 27:03.827
They said it was against the law
for me to ever leave them.

27:04.664 --> 27:06.575
Where did you get that bruise?

27:06.666 --> 27:10.204
Mr. Gogan. lwas milking the cow
and I missed the bucket.

27:12.047 --> 27:15.756
-Had he done that before?
-All the time.

27:15.842 --> 27:19.676
The first time I ran away,
the orphan home sent me back.

27:19.721 --> 27:22.212
This time, I'll just keep running.

27:24.434 --> 27:26.846
Well, you'll be safe here.

27:26.895 --> 27:30.308
Nora, no one's ever been
this nice to me.

27:30.398 --> 27:32.684
I'll always remember it.

27:32.734 --> 27:37.068
Pete, why don't you sleep here tonight?
We'll figure out what to do tomorrow.

27:37.155 --> 27:38.235
Okay?

27:40.241 --> 27:42.948
Wonderful. I've got work to do.
Come on.

27:44.913 --> 27:47.029
Are you anybody's mother?

27:47.082 --> 27:49.164
I'm not even anybody's wife.

27:49.250 --> 27:52.162
But you're gonna get married,
now, aren't you?

27:53.755 --> 27:56.747
I'm already married to this lighthouse.

27:56.841 --> 27:58.251
Who's that?

27:59.260 --> 28:00.386
Paul.

28:00.428 --> 28:04.091
-Is he part of your family?
-He almost was.

28:04.182 --> 28:07.049
How can someone
almost be part of a family?

28:07.102 --> 28:08.933
We were going to be married.

28:08.978 --> 28:10.684
How come you weren't?

28:11.981 --> 28:15.724
Well, as far as we know,
his ship was headed for a storm.

28:17.821 --> 28:20.278
They were never heard from again.

28:20.907 --> 28:23.114
That was a year ago.

28:23.159 --> 28:24.774
He'll come back.

28:25.662 --> 28:28.404
I tell myself the same thing every day,

28:28.456 --> 28:31.789
standing up there
watching for ships on the horizon.

28:33.169 --> 28:35.455
Time I should be thinking
of other things, so they tell me.

28:36.923 --> 28:39.039
I'll have to ask Elliott about Paul.

28:39.134 --> 28:41.796
He has a way of knowing things.

28:41.845 --> 28:43.335
Who's Elliott?

28:44.305 --> 28:46.011
-My dragon.
-Dragon?

28:47.892 --> 28:51.134
-So you're the boy with the dragon.
-Yup.

28:51.187 --> 28:54.429
-Where is he?
-Down in the cave.

28:54.482 --> 28:56.018
That's interesting.

28:56.109 --> 28:59.818
I've never known anyone with a dragon.
What does he look like?

28:59.863 --> 29:02.070
Just a plain, ordinary dragon.

29:02.157 --> 29:04.148
How plain? How ordinary?

29:05.368 --> 29:08.860
He has the head of a camel

29:08.955 --> 29:10.991
The neck of a crocodile

29:11.082 --> 29:13.289
It sounds rather strange

29:14.002 --> 29:17.165
He’s both a ﬁsh and a mammal

29:17.213 --> 29:21.001
And / hope he’ll never change

29:23.052 --> 29:27.921
’Cause it’s not easy
to ﬁnd someone who cares

29:28.016 --> 29:32.305
It’s not easy to ﬁnd magic in pairs

29:32.353 --> 29:35.095
I’m glad / found him, / love him

29:35.190 --> 29:38.728
/ won ’t let him get away

29:40.403 --> 29:43.315
’Cause it’s not easy

29:46.576 --> 29:50.114
You say the head of a camel

29:50.205 --> 29:52.070
The neck of a crocodile

29:52.165 --> 29:54.372
And the ears of a cow!

29:55.251 --> 29:58.743
It’s clear that friends can be different

29:58.838 --> 30:02.422
Yes, / understand you now

30:04.469 --> 30:06.960
-/t’s not easy
-/t’s not easy

30:07.055 --> 30:09.137

30:11.351 --> 30:13.387
-To ﬁnd magic in pairs
-To ﬁnd magic in pairs

30:13.478 --> 30:16.265
Now that you have him, hold him

30:16.356 --> 30:19.814
Treasure him from day to day

30:21.861 --> 30:24.398
It’s so easy

30:27.784 --> 30:32.027
Life is lollipops and raindrops

30:32.080 --> 30:35.698
With the one you love

30:36.459 --> 30:40.202
Someone you can always be with

30:40.255 --> 30:43.088
Argue and agree with

30:44.551 --> 30:47.338
Climb the highest tree with

30:48.930 --> 30:51.421
-/t’s not easy
-/t’s not easy

30:51.474 --> 30:53.590

30:57.939 --> 31:00.772
You’ve got to tend it, fan it

31:00.859 --> 31:03.771
That’s what / plan to do

31:05.738 --> 31:11.153
/ had one friend by my side

31:12.203 --> 31:15.536
Now / have two

31:17.125 --> 31:19.662
Him and you

31:21.462 --> 31:25.296
Him and me

31:25.800 --> 31:30.590
-And it’s so easy
-And it’s so easy

32:14.807 --> 32:17.423
-Good morning, sir.
-Good morning, son.

32:18.603 --> 32:22.095
-Nice to see you again.
-Thank you.

32:27.070 --> 32:29.686
-|t's you!
-What's the matter?

32:29.781 --> 32:31.066
lt's you!

32:31.866 --> 32:33.652
The boy with the dragon.

32:39.874 --> 32:42.741
Dad! Dad, what is it?

32:43.503 --> 32:48.418
-The boy with the dragon.
-I know, I know. Now, just take it easy.

32:48.508 --> 32:50.464
You saw it. You saw it?

32:50.551 --> 32:53.213
Well, I didn't actually see it,
but I know what it looks like.

32:53.262 --> 32:56.595
-But”
-We'll talk about it later.

32:56.683 --> 33:01.803
One thing I must know,
it isn't in the lighthouse, is it?

33:01.896 --> 33:05.263
-No, Elliott's down in the cave.
-Elliott...

33:05.358 --> 33:09.943
Elliott? It even has a name.

33:10.029 --> 33:12.645
There's nothing to get upset about.

33:12.740 --> 33:15.903
You're right. Right,
there's nothing to get upset about.

33:15.952 --> 33:19.865
Nothing. No, why should I get upset?
I should be happy.

33:19.914 --> 33:23.748
I should be happy. I'll go down
to the saloon and I'll tell the boys.

33:23.793 --> 33:27.752
I'll say, "Boys, here it is."
And then hear the apologies.

33:28.589 --> 33:31.501
Elliott'll be happy to do it for you, sir.

33:32.176 --> 33:34.167
Good boy. Good lad.

33:34.262 --> 33:37.800
Just you and me and Elliott.
We'll go into the saloon.

33:38.516 --> 33:39.676
Elliott.

33:39.767 --> 33:44.761
He won't start to scratch
or fight or set anything on fire, will he?

33:44.856 --> 33:47.939
-Well, he's sort of...
-Sort of what?

33:47.984 --> 33:51.943
-Unpredictable.
-Now, don't do anything with Elliott.

33:51.988 --> 33:54.445
Why don't you leave him where he is?

33:54.490 --> 33:56.606
It's too dangerous to take him into town.

33:56.701 --> 33:57.781
lt's dangerous.

33:57.827 --> 34:02.287
Now, I don't want either one of you
to say a word about Elliott to anyone.

34:02.331 --> 34:03.537
-Do you understand?
-Yes.

34:03.624 --> 34:05.125
Until we've talked this over.

34:05.168 --> 34:06.453
Now, let's all have breakfast.

34:06.544 --> 34:08.751
The lamp has to be polished,
and the lens cleaned,

34:08.796 --> 34:10.627
and lwant to take Pete
to buy some new clothes.

34:10.673 --> 34:12.504
Yes, we'll clean Elliott
and eat the lamp.

34:12.592 --> 34:15.129
I mean we'll clean the lamp.

34:16.971 --> 34:18.962
Elliott! The name's Elliott.
Did you hear that?

34:29.776 --> 34:31.641
Doc Terminus is coming!

34:43.664 --> 34:45.404
We lost them.

34:45.500 --> 34:46.660
Good.

34:49.337 --> 34:53.171
-Passamaquoddy ahead, ahoy!
-What?

34:53.216 --> 34:57.550
Passamaquoddy ahead, ahoy!

34:58.346 --> 35:00.678
-No.
-Yes.

35:14.112 --> 35:16.854
-S|ow down!
-My fence!

35:19.200 --> 35:21.031
Throw out the anchor!

35:25.456 --> 35:29.119
Since we all concur, gentlemen,
I suggest that we adjourn.

35:43.391 --> 35:46.428
-Watch Bones.
-Get him off of me! Get him off!

35:50.606 --> 35:52.562
I think they remember us.

35:53.401 --> 35:55.813
I think I remember them.

35:55.903 --> 35:59.816
-Just act normal.
-I am acting normal. I'm ready to run.

35:59.907 --> 36:01.568
Quick, what's the name
of this town again?

36:01.659 --> 36:03.240
Passamaquoddy.

36:04.036 --> 36:06.493
-"Quassama" what?
-Passamaquoddy!

36:06.581 --> 36:11.120
Got it. How wonderful to see
your smiling faces again.

36:11.210 --> 36:12.620
All of you.

36:12.712 --> 36:15.249
I've never known such warmth,

36:15.298 --> 36:17.209
such welcome,

36:17.258 --> 36:20.421
such loving hospitality.

36:22.930 --> 36:25.216
And don't bring those
phony remedies here again.

36:25.266 --> 36:28.008
Go on back where you belong, jail.

36:29.270 --> 36:32.307
Thank you, thank you,
thank you, thank you.

36:32.398 --> 36:34.309
I sense enthusiasm,

36:34.400 --> 36:36.436
I sense loving response,

36:36.527 --> 36:40.019
and that's why I feel
that this is my home

36:40.114 --> 36:41.615
away from home.

36:42.450 --> 36:46.068
I’ve been bringing cures
from Pilgrim Heights to Provincetown

36:46.120 --> 36:49.783
Treated rabid fever
down on Queen Anne Road

36:49.832 --> 36:53.450
Gout or gastritis, mumps or bronchitis

36:53.502 --> 36:57.086
Bites and burns and blue abrasions
Got a pill for all occasions

36:57.131 --> 37:00.498
Little Sippewissett was so nice to visit

37:00.593 --> 37:04.302
And Scraggy Neck is lovely to recall

37:04.388 --> 37:07.801
/ took your drug for losing weight
and now I’m a blob

37:08.476 --> 37:11.468
But now there’s so much
more of you to love

37:13.314 --> 37:17.307
/ wiped out impetigo
on the banks of Buttermilk

37:17.401 --> 37:20.985
Flu is under ﬁrm control
in Powder Hole

37:21.030 --> 37:24.614
Terminus potions, tablets and lotions

37:28.412 --> 37:32.030
Spent a day in Buzzards Bay
They couldn’t keep me there

37:32.124 --> 37:34.866
Even turned away from Kingdom Hall

37:34.961 --> 37:37.043
-They probably threw you out!
-They probably threw you out!

37:37.380 --> 37:39.371
"They probably threw..."

37:39.674 --> 37:43.917
My hair was gray and thanks to you
it turned into pink

37:44.011 --> 37:46.423
But that colour, it’s so becoming

37:48.849 --> 37:52.683
We’re gonna wash your phony tonics
right down the sink!

37:52.728 --> 37:57.722
Wait. Listen.
My specialties are audiology, mycology,

37:57.817 --> 38:02.436
serology, teratology,
embryology, psychology, zoology.

38:02.530 --> 38:05.272
And any other ology you can think of!

38:05.366 --> 38:08.153
My friends, you're not
giving me a chance!

38:09.036 --> 38:13.951
I brought all these medicines
back from Paris, France.

38:18.796 --> 38:21.879
Shamed be he who thinks evil of it.

38:21.924 --> 38:26.042
And that's what the medical business is
all about, folks. People helping people.

38:26.137 --> 38:28.128
You should all have help.

38:28.931 --> 38:31.217
Gadzooks! What have we here?

38:33.060 --> 38:35.551
Doctor, Doctor, Doctor.

38:35.604 --> 38:38.061
All I'm asking for is a miracle.

38:38.149 --> 38:40.686
All he wants is a miracle, folks.

38:40.735 --> 38:45.820
How can I deny him? If he's willing
to pay for it, he's gonna get it.

38:45.906 --> 38:48.363
-Any price.
-$1, sir.

39:18.189 --> 39:21.431
-I trust him.
-I believe in the Doc.

39:23.444 --> 39:25.605
I'd put my life in his hands.

39:27.406 --> 39:30.739
My friends, you’ve seen a miracle
and you’ll see many more

39:30.785 --> 39:33.492
People will come pouring in
from land and sea

39:33.579 --> 39:36.787
We 7/ have centres for testing
Let’s start investing

39:36.874 --> 39:38.660
Keep those dimes
and dollars mounting

39:38.751 --> 39:40.287
-/’ll collect
-/’ll do the counting

39:40.336 --> 39:43.453
Everyone who lives here
will be strong and healthy

39:43.506 --> 39:46.464
You’ll be getting richer by the day

39:48.469 --> 39:52.462

This town will be famous

will look at us and say, "It’s... "

-Passamaquoddy!

40:30.886 --> 40:31.921
I know.

40:34.181 --> 40:36.763
Pete, if you bring up the oilcan,
we'll be ready for the night.

40:36.851 --> 40:40.469
Sure. Before that,
I'd like to show Elliott my new suit.

40:40.521 --> 40:42.557
-No! No, no.
-He'll never...

40:42.648 --> 40:44.513
You can't bring Elliott up here.

40:45.860 --> 40:51.651
Government regulation 302 states that
no dragons shall be allowed

40:51.699 --> 40:54.657
on the premises of
the United States' lighthouses.

40:55.369 --> 40:57.530
Now, go on down and get the oil

40:57.580 --> 40:59.912
so I can mark it up in the log
that you did that.

40:59.999 --> 41:05.460
Okay. Nora, first, can I bring
Paul's picture down to Elliott?

41:05.546 --> 41:07.958
Then he can start looking for Paul.

41:11.719 --> 41:13.004
All right.

41:23.939 --> 41:26.055
-Thanks, Dad.
-For what?

41:26.150 --> 41:27.856
For making believe about the dragon

41:27.902 --> 41:29.017
-and going along with it.
-Making...

41:29.069 --> 41:33.233
It means a lot to Pete.
Sort of a family he made up.

41:33.282 --> 41:35.739
I'm not making believe. I saw it.
I actually saw it!

41:35.826 --> 41:37.817
And I haven't been the same since!

41:37.912 --> 41:39.152
You go down to the cave,
you'd see it, too,

41:39.246 --> 41:41.828
and your eyes would just pop right out!

41:41.916 --> 41:44.453
l was there. I saw nothing!

41:45.211 --> 41:47.497
Dad, be realistic.

41:48.756 --> 41:52.840
You wanna be realistic.
Let's talk about how realistic you are.

41:52.927 --> 41:55.009
Here you are,
waiting for someone to come back

41:55.095 --> 41:57.586
thatjust ain't gonna come back, Nora.

41:57.681 --> 42:00.593
And if waiting for over
a year hasn't told you nothing,

42:00.684 --> 42:04.597
then you're not the one to talk
about being realistic, are you?

42:06.774 --> 42:10.983
Honey, I'm sorry. I didn't mean that.

42:13.030 --> 42:15.112
I'm going down to the hardware store.

42:25.125 --> 42:28.288
Hi, Elliott!
How do you like my new suit?

42:44.270 --> 42:48.434
And new shoes, too.
Look at the way they shine!

42:54.822 --> 42:58.360
Nora's so nice to me,
I want us to do something for her.

43:01.870 --> 43:04.953
I want you to concentrate
on finding Paul for Nora.

43:04.999 --> 43:07.115
This is what he looks like.

43:11.672 --> 43:14.880
Remember his face. Try real hard.

43:26.186 --> 43:27.687
Better go now.

43:33.277 --> 43:34.892
See you tomorrow.

43:52.087 --> 43:55.375
I've had nothing, nothing
but bad luck in this burg.

43:57.801 --> 44:00.292
-l'm sorry, Doc.
-You see what I mean?

44:00.387 --> 44:03.879
Doc, I'm sorry. I didn't mean it. Hoagy.

44:03.932 --> 44:06.423
-Can I buy everybody a round?
-Yeah.

44:07.686 --> 44:10.723
Hey, 'cause,
Doc, I got to talk to you. Okay?

44:10.814 --> 44:13.066
-Sit down.
-May I? Thank you.

44:13.233 --> 44:16.066
Hey, you're a man of science, ain't you?

44:16.111 --> 44:18.773
A man of science, yes. Yes, I am.

44:18.864 --> 44:21.856
With degrees from
the Royal Medical College, London.

44:21.909 --> 44:24.525
-The Gleinen Einen Peitzen in Vienna.
-No.

44:24.578 --> 44:26.944
And the Moulin Rouge in Paris.

44:27.998 --> 44:30.740
You know anything about dragons?

44:30.793 --> 44:34.411
Of course I do. | see them in all
the big cities going down the streets,

44:34.463 --> 44:36.328
with that funny little walk,
wearing bright colours,

44:36.423 --> 44:38.084
-f|uttering around...
-No, no, no.

44:38.133 --> 44:42.376
I'm talking about a real dragon.
Real dragon.

44:42.429 --> 44:46.547
With fire coming out of his mouth.

44:47.476 --> 44:51.014
And he's got real wings.

44:51.814 --> 44:53.975
You need a veterinarian.

44:54.942 --> 44:57.524
-Why do you ask?
-I saw one.

44:59.321 --> 45:01.482
Is it sitting at the next table?

45:02.741 --> 45:07.155
| tell you, I saw a real dragon
yesterday afternoon.

45:08.080 --> 45:11.868
He's owned by a young boy

45:11.959 --> 45:14.120
by the name of Pete.

45:14.169 --> 45:17.787
You are trying to tell me
that there is a dragon here

45:19.383 --> 45:21.214
-Yeah.
-Yes.

45:21.301 --> 45:23.963
I told you this was a rotten town.

45:24.054 --> 45:26.636
Well, in my educated opinion, sir,

45:26.724 --> 45:29.306
I think you've been up
in your lighthouse too long.

45:30.269 --> 45:35.138
Wait. Wait. Wait, listen.
What if what I just told you was true?

45:35.190 --> 45:39.183
In my scientific opinion,
the existence of a dragon

45:39.278 --> 45:42.315
would have an impact
of gigantic proportions.

45:42.406 --> 45:45.819
Mythology and legend would
become history and science.

45:46.785 --> 45:48.286
One could really make
a quick buck with it.

45:48.328 --> 45:51.240
Well, I can prove it. I can prove it!

45:52.124 --> 45:53.955
His name is Elliott.

45:54.001 --> 45:57.539
He's downstairs. You could go
and see him right now if you wanted to.

45:57.629 --> 46:00.462
Unfortunately,
I cannot make it right now.

46:00.507 --> 46:02.247
l have an appointment
with a young lady

46:02.342 --> 46:04.879
who's interested in a nursing career.

46:06.513 --> 46:10.597
-I wanna see it.
-You wanna see it?

46:10.684 --> 46:13.517
-We||, see it you shall!
-Okay.

46:22.988 --> 46:26.401
| tell you that he's in there.

46:32.539 --> 46:36.657
-Are you convinced?
-Absolutely.

46:38.003 --> 46:41.712
-Let's get out of here.
-Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

46:41.799 --> 46:43.460
lwanna pet him.

46:44.593 --> 46:47.335
You wanna pet him?

46:48.764 --> 46:50.254
Are you crazy?

46:51.517 --> 46:53.758
I know you ain't drunk.

46:53.852 --> 46:58.562
No matter what you see in here,
don't get scared.

47:02.945 --> 47:06.233
Hey, I might as well tell you straight off,

47:06.323 --> 47:10.783
you're gonna see a hideous monster.

47:10.869 --> 47:12.951
-No.
-Yes.

47:14.331 --> 47:16.162
And it's big.

47:17.084 --> 47:19.700
50 feet of terror!

47:19.753 --> 47:25.123
Claws! Claws so sharp
they could tear a man to shreds.

47:26.426 --> 47:32.467
Eyes, evil eyes
that can see right through you.

47:32.558 --> 47:37.268
And a tail that's so big and powerful,

47:37.354 --> 47:40.721
it could destroy the hull of a frigate!

47:41.859 --> 47:46.944
It can wipe out an entire crew
with one swish of his tail.

47:48.365 --> 47:54.577
Face... Face so terrible,
it could turn a man to stone,

47:56.123 --> 47:59.365
a hero into a coward.

48:07.634 --> 48:13.004
A flame so hot, it could roast a turkey!

48:13.098 --> 48:15.965
And a mouth so terrible,

48:16.018 --> 48:20.227
it could devour a man
and spit him 20 leagues.

48:22.316 --> 48:23.977
Stay close.

48:36.330 --> 48:41.495
It's got me!

48:47.341 --> 48:50.083
Look at it!

49:04.942 --> 49:07.979
Them eyes are looking
right through us.

49:09.279 --> 49:13.522
Look, don't ever let a dragon
know you're afraid of him.

49:17.120 --> 49:20.157
Stop. Stop shaking and smile.

49:20.207 --> 49:24.371
Can't stop shaking, and I am smiling.

49:25.629 --> 49:28.541
Hello. Hello. Hello, Elliott.

49:35.055 --> 49:36.670
See how smart he is?

49:36.723 --> 49:40.181
He said "hello" to me.
Yeah! He likes me!

49:41.228 --> 49:43.389
You do something so he'll like you.

49:43.438 --> 49:45.053
-Like me?
-Yeah.

49:46.858 --> 49:49.895
Do something to make him like you.

49:52.072 --> 49:53.437
You think?

49:57.119 --> 50:01.988
Elliott, would you like a little belt?

51:19.159 --> 51:22.151
Is it two parts fish oil
and three parts seawater

51:22.204 --> 51:26.994
and six parts potato squeezings,
or is it only two parts seawater?

51:28.502 --> 51:32.415
Ten parts seawater? That much.
No wonder they love it.

51:34.841 --> 51:36.832
-Saw it.
-Saw what?

51:44.893 --> 51:48.010
What is an el-el-el dra-dra-dra?

51:49.314 --> 51:52.522
Dragon. I saw the dragon.

51:53.193 --> 51:58.153
Lampie wasn't lying.
It's real. It belched flame at me.

51:58.198 --> 52:01.361
Belched? You saw a belching dragon?

52:01.409 --> 52:03.946
You sure you weren't belching yourself
in front of the mirror?

52:04.037 --> 52:07.871
Never saw anything
so horrible in my life.

52:07.916 --> 52:12.285
Thought I was a goner.
There was no need for him to do that.

52:12.379 --> 52:14.711
I only offered him a sociable drink.

52:14.798 --> 52:17.210
Hoagy, I can't stand you
when you're drunk.

52:17.300 --> 52:20.417
Doc, look at me. I'm not drunk.

52:20.512 --> 52:23.219
What I saw tonight
sobered me in a second.

52:23.306 --> 52:27.549
I swear. I swear to you,
there's a big, horrible dragon

52:27.644 --> 52:29.760
up in that cave. I swear.

52:29.855 --> 52:33.143
| just realized,
I can't stand you when you're sober!

52:33.233 --> 52:37.067
Now, get out of here.
Get yourself a good, stiff drink. Out!

52:37.154 --> 52:41.397
-I swear. A vicious dragon.
-Out!

52:42.617 --> 52:43.823
Dragon.

52:52.377 --> 52:55.244
I ain't got hardly nothing to sell.

52:55.297 --> 52:59.631
So? I pulled my nets in,
and there weren't a fish in them.

52:59.718 --> 53:04.132
ljust docked. There ain't nothing out
in that ocean but water.

53:04.222 --> 53:09.057
It's real strange, I'm telling you.
It's like every fish sort of disappeared.

53:09.102 --> 53:12.219
Just suddenly up and disappeared.

53:12.272 --> 53:15.435
There's the cause of it. That kid Pete.

53:15.525 --> 53:18.688
From the day he come to town,
the fishing turned sour.

53:18.778 --> 53:22.362
-Don't be ridiculous.
-|t's that crazy dragon talk of his.

53:23.074 --> 53:25.986
That kid's been nothing
but bad luck wherever he goes.

53:26.077 --> 53:28.454
You're a bunch of
superstitious ding-dongs.

53:28.538 --> 53:31.245
You know that fishing grounds shift
from time to time.

53:31.291 --> 53:33.782
Elliott will make the fish come back.

53:33.835 --> 53:36.451
There he goes, talking dragons again.

53:37.130 --> 53:40.793
Hey, kid! There ain't no room
in this town for a dragon,

53:40.884 --> 53:43.921
and there ain't no room in this town
forjinxes like you, neither!

53:43.970 --> 53:47.087
Well, if there's enough room
for a chowder-head like you,

53:47.140 --> 53:50.632
then there's more than
enough room for a dragon.

53:51.645 --> 53:55.809
There ’3 room for everyone in this world

53:55.857 --> 53:58.940
If everyone makes some room

53:59.903 --> 54:04.112
Won ’t you move over
and share this world

54:04.157 --> 54:07.320
Everyone make some room

54:07.369 --> 54:11.703
Even a dragon deserves a place
A wide-open space

54:11.790 --> 54:15.499
With no reins, no chains

54:15.585 --> 54:18.702
He wants to play games
Dance with you

54:18.797 --> 54:22.631
Give him a chance to sing his song

54:22.676 --> 54:26.589
He only wants to belong

54:29.182 --> 54:33.175
There ’3 room for everyone in this world

54:33.228 --> 54:36.095
Will everyone make some room?

54:37.524 --> 54:41.517
Spread out while Elliott gets uncurled

54:41.611 --> 54:45.604
Fly on his back and zoom

54:45.699 --> 54:47.860
-Rock him and ride him
-Rock him and ride him

54:47.909 --> 54:49.900
-And line up beside him
-And line up beside him

54:49.995 --> 54:53.783
-You’ll see how quickly you blend
-You’ll see how quickly you blend

54:53.873 --> 54:59.368
A dragon is just one more stranger
in search of a friend

55:02.340 --> 55:04.422
-There’s room for everyone
-There’s room for everyone

55:04.509 --> 55:06.465
-/n this world
-/n this world

55:06.553 --> 55:09.545
Back up and make some room

55:10.598 --> 55:12.554
-Let’s all move over
-Let’s all move over

55:12.642 --> 55:14.883
-And share this world
-And share this world

55:14.936 --> 55:17.678
-Everyone make some room
-Everyone make some room

55:17.981 --> 55:20.893
Just think how far out the ocean goes

55:20.984 --> 55:26.274
The whirling wind blows
shore to shore, door to door

55:26.364 --> 55:31.074
Think of the valleys and mountaintops
The Earth never stops

55:31.161 --> 55:35.325
-80 deep, so high
-With miles of sky

55:35.415 --> 55:37.747
-We all have part of the pie
-We all have part of the pie

55:37.834 --> 55:41.793
Welcome the dragon
while you have a chance

55:41.880 --> 55:43.745
Give him his moment

55:43.798 --> 55:49.919
To rise up and dance

56:41.689 --> 56:45.682
There ’3 room for everyone in this world

56:45.777 --> 56:49.315
Will everyone make some room

56:49.406 --> 56:50.441
Elliott!

56:50.490 --> 56:53.982
Love given freely can spare this world

56:54.077 --> 56:57.695
Let friendly feelings bloom

56:58.331 --> 57:00.117
-Just give an inch
-Just give an inch

57:00.166 --> 57:02.157
-Give a yard, never flinch
-Give a yard, never flinch

57:02.210 --> 57:06.249
-When the time comes to offer a hand
-When the time comes to offer a hand

57:06.339 --> 57:10.878
So let’s all make sure
we give everyone somewhere to stand

57:10.969 --> 57:17.511
Let’s all make sure
we give everyone somewhere to stand

57:17.559 --> 57:21.643
Just the way God planned it

57:21.688 --> 57:27.558
Just the way God planned

57:49.174 --> 57:55.465
You're late. Late. Late. Late. Late.

58:05.064 --> 58:08.397
Why is the bell ringing?
There's no one out there.

58:08.902 --> 58:10.483
I'll stop it.

58:13.698 --> 58:15.905
Elliott, stop it!

58:17.327 --> 58:19.613
The bell isn't supposed
to ring till recess!

58:19.704 --> 58:21.990
-Stop that!
-l'm not doing it.

58:22.081 --> 58:25.209
Liar, liar, liar.

58:27.003 --> 58:28.504
It's the knuckle-cracker for you.

58:29.297 --> 58:32.084
Three for lying
and three for whom the bell tolls.

58:32.175 --> 58:33.164
Come.

58:41.184 --> 58:44.096
Put your hands out.
Palms down, knuckles up.

58:44.896 --> 58:47.808
One. Two. Three!

58:48.107 --> 58:50.098
-It doesn't hurt much, Elliott.
-Four!

58:50.193 --> 58:53.060
-Whom are you talking to? Five, six!
-Elliott!

58:53.112 --> 58:55.023
-Whom?
-My dragon.

58:55.615 --> 58:59.358
Your dragon, wagon.
Nothing but a network of lies!

58:59.452 --> 59:01.613
Three more for your imagination!

59:01.704 --> 59:05.868
Seven! Eight! And a great big nine!

59:10.296 --> 59:12.207
Go stand in the corner.

59:16.803 --> 59:18.885
Work, work, work, everyone.

59:19.138 --> 59:21.390
All this nonsense about a dragon.

59:24.143 --> 59:26.680
-No, Elliott!
-You did it!

59:27.188 --> 59:29.349
You pulled the chair out
from under me.

59:29.440 --> 59:32.056
-It was Elliott.
-That does it.

59:33.820 --> 59:35.731
You've had a taste
of the knuckle-cracker.

59:35.822 --> 59:37.938
Now you'll have a dose
of the behind-breaker.

59:38.199 --> 59:39.530
Bend over.

59:48.626 --> 59:50.662
No, no, Elliott. Get out!

59:58.303 --> 1:00:01.761
No, Elliott, you're going
about this the wrong way.

1:00:01.848 --> 1:00:04.590
Go back to the cave. Go on!

1:00:11.566 --> 1:00:14.353
Jehoshaphat! Would you look at that!

1:00:18.197 --> 1:00:21.109
-Why do I hear a bell ringing?
-School must be out.

1:00:21.993 --> 1:00:23.858
It's too early, stupid.

1:00:26.080 --> 1:00:28.366
See, I told you. School is out.

1:00:28.791 --> 1:00:31.498
-Wait! What's happening?
-Pete's dragon wrecked the school!

1:00:31.544 --> 1:00:34.877
I told you. I told you!

1:00:34.922 --> 1:00:36.128
What's happened over there?

1:00:36.215 --> 1:00:38.251
Something crashed
right through the school.

1:00:38.426 --> 1:00:41.714
Look at it, I'm telling you.
It's a big hole in the side of the wall.

1:00:45.975 --> 1:00:51.561
And the dragon came in through
one wall and went out the other wall.

1:00:51.648 --> 1:00:53.513
Now do you believe me?

1:00:59.572 --> 1:01:03.736
-You think this kid Pete would sell it?
-Money talks.

1:01:03.785 --> 1:01:06.868
First there's a dragon.
Now he tells me money talks.

1:01:06.913 --> 1:01:09.245
Will miracles never cease?

1:01:09.290 --> 1:01:12.248
Dragons, dragons, dragons. Dragons.

1:01:15.004 --> 1:01:19.168
List of useful parts.
Claws, ears, tongue.

1:01:20.051 --> 1:01:23.088
Hey, this could be
a very profitable business.

1:01:23.763 --> 1:01:26.675
There's so many cures
from bits of dragon.

1:01:32.021 --> 1:01:35.605
Dragon whiskers, dragon toes

1:01:35.692 --> 1:01:39.731
A dragon tooth and a dragon nose

1:01:41.114 --> 1:01:45.073
Every little piece, every little piece

1:01:45.118 --> 1:01:48.702
We could make a million
by slicing him, dicing him

1:01:48.788 --> 1:01:52.280
Hoagy, we could sell every little shell

1:01:55.837 --> 1:01:59.500
Money, money, money by the pound

1:01:59.590 --> 1:02:03.128
Every little piece, every little piece

1:02:03.177 --> 1:02:06.635
/ can take a scissor
and clip him up, rip him up

1:02:06.723 --> 1:02:10.341
Every little part is a work of art

1:02:10.435 --> 1:02:13.802
Think of what
a dragon heart would bring

1:02:13.896 --> 1:02:17.605
Wrapped up in a ribbon and a string

1:02:17.650 --> 1:02:21.234
-Dragon liver can cure a cold
-Dragon liver can cure a cold

1:02:21.320 --> 1:02:23.982
-Dragon powder grows hair
-Dragon powder grows hair

1:02:24.490 --> 1:02:26.230
-With dragon blood
-With dragon blood

1:02:26.325 --> 1:02:28.987
-You’ll never grow old
-You’ll never grow old

1:02:29.078 --> 1:02:32.320
Every item is covered with gold

1:02:32.790 --> 1:02:37.830
Every item is covered with gold

1:02:39.964 --> 1:02:43.673
Every little piece, every little piece

1:02:43.760 --> 1:02:47.503
Dragon, you’re my wagon to destiny
You’re the key

1:02:47.597 --> 1:02:51.055
Every little shred moving me ahead

1:02:51.142 --> 1:02:54.259
Every dream of mine will be fulﬁlled

1:02:54.353 --> 1:02:58.312
What a dragon business we can build

1:02:58.357 --> 1:03:02.020
-Dragon cartilage keeps you thin
-Dragon cartilage keeps you thin

1:03:02.111 --> 1:03:05.399
-Dragon fat is for burns
-Dragon fat is for burns

1:03:05.490 --> 1:03:09.859
-A dragon tear will clear up your skin
-A dragon tear will clear up your skin

1:03:09.911 --> 1:03:13.574
Watch the proﬁts come rolling in

1:03:13.664 --> 1:03:20.001
-Watch the proﬁts come rolling in
-Watch the proﬁts come rolling in

1:03:20.046 --> 1:03:23.379
-E very little piece, every little crease
-E very little piece, every little crease

1:03:23.466 --> 1:03:27.379
Lead me to the dragon
I’ll buy him up, tie him up

1:03:27.470 --> 1:03:33.181
Drag him from the cave
Show him that I’m brave

1:03:33.976 --> 1:03:37.969
I’ll bind him up, grind him up
Lop him up, chop him up

1:03:38.648 --> 1:03:43.142
Can’t you hear
that jingle-jangle sound?

1:03:43.236 --> 1:03:45.272
Oh, yeah

1:03:47.073 --> 1:03:48.734
-/t’s money, money, money
-/t’s money, money, money

1:03:48.825 --> 1:03:50.656
-By the pound
-By the pound

1:04:01.671 --> 1:04:05.914
Good morning, Miss Nora.
So, this is where you live, eh?

1:04:06.008 --> 1:04:07.589
At last we've seen the light.

1:04:10.263 --> 1:04:13.380
| tell you, you've got to have
a sense of humour these days.

1:04:13.432 --> 1:04:16.560
-And you must be Pete.
-Yes, sir!

1:04:18.521 --> 1:04:23.436
l'm Dr. Terminus, and this is Hoagy,
who's doing his internship with me.

1:04:24.735 --> 1:04:26.771
I heard about the incident
at school yesterday...

1:04:26.821 --> 1:04:28.106
I'd rather not discuss it.

1:04:28.155 --> 1:04:33.115
I realize you must be disturbed about it
and up to here in dragons.

1:04:34.287 --> 1:04:37.996
You know, Pete,
I have always loved dragons.

1:04:38.082 --> 1:04:40.744
They're such wonderful creatures.

1:04:40.793 --> 1:04:43.705
When they're not busy
destroying things, of course.

1:04:43.796 --> 1:04:45.787
I've had a dream since I was your age

1:04:45.882 --> 1:04:50.251
that one day
I would have my very own dragon.

1:04:50.303 --> 1:04:52.089
I would consider my life to be fulfilled

1:04:52.138 --> 1:04:57.633
and would be most grateful
if you would sell me your dragon.

1:04:59.437 --> 1:05:03.180
You wanna buy Elliott?

1:05:03.274 --> 1:05:05.481
Sight unseen. As is.

1:05:05.568 --> 1:05:08.310
We'll give him a good home. Bless him.

1:05:09.530 --> 1:05:11.145
I couldn't sell him.

1:05:11.198 --> 1:05:12.529
Sure you could!

1:05:12.617 --> 1:05:15.359
That's what life is all about.
Buying and selling.

1:05:15.453 --> 1:05:19.696
-l'll give you $3.
-Offer him $4!

1:05:19.790 --> 1:05:24.534
l'll offer him $5,
it'll make his head swim. $5.

1:05:26.547 --> 1:05:29.710
I can't sell him. I don't own him.

1:05:29.800 --> 1:05:33.588
-Well, what did you do, rent him?
-Well, who owns him?

1:05:33.679 --> 1:05:35.670
Well, nobody, I guess.

1:05:35.723 --> 1:05:39.932
He just came to me.
He only goes to those who need him.

1:05:40.019 --> 1:05:41.350
I need him.

1:05:42.355 --> 1:05:45.472
Listen, Doc, I don't know what you're
up to, but you better forget about this.

1:05:45.524 --> 1:05:48.857
-He's not for sale.
-Nora, go paint your lighthouse.

1:05:48.903 --> 1:05:51.861
Pete, my boy,
you're conversant with Elliott.

1:05:51.948 --> 1:05:55.190
Now, talk to him.
Tell him how much I need him.

1:05:55.284 --> 1:05:58.196
Look, deliver Elliott to me
and the fiver is yours,

1:05:58.245 --> 1:06:01.078
plus a bottle of my medicine
that's guaranteed

1:06:01.165 --> 1:06:04.157
to bring on puberty
two years ahead of time.

1:06:04.210 --> 1:06:06.041
And that's better than a dragon.

1:06:07.171 --> 1:06:10.254
Doc, maybe you should talk
to Elliott yourself.

1:06:11.384 --> 1:06:13.295
Where is he? Does he speak English?

1:06:13.386 --> 1:06:14.876
Down the beach.

1:06:18.849 --> 1:06:21.431
-Where?
-Right there, by the water.

1:06:29.402 --> 1:06:33.441
-Right. I still don't see...
-That's because he's invisible today.

1:06:36.951 --> 1:06:39.317
They know they're sitting
on a gold mine.

1:06:39.412 --> 1:06:42.575
Well, they've had their chance
to make a few dollars.

1:06:57.680 --> 1:07:02.344
That dragon doesn't belong to anybody.
He's fair game and he's gonna be ours.

1:07:02.435 --> 1:07:06.348
We 7/ bind him up, grind him up
Lop him up, chop him up

1:07:06.439 --> 1:07:10.148
Can’t you hear
that jingle-jangle sound?

1:07:10.234 --> 1:07:12.190
Oh, yeah

1:07:13.779 --> 1:07:16.612
It’s money, money, money
by the pound

1:07:38.262 --> 1:07:39.968
Fog!Fog!

1:07:41.015 --> 1:07:42.926
-Where's the fog?
-There's not much fog.

1:07:42.975 --> 1:07:45.682
We were just using the horn
to chase off a few buzzards.

1:07:45.770 --> 1:07:48.762
Few buzzards.
Nora, how many times must I...

1:07:51.150 --> 1:07:55.063
Started already, huh? Look,
if you're gonna whitewash, son, look,

1:07:55.154 --> 1:08:00.239
let your brush go up and down, up.
That's it, boy. And down.

1:08:00.326 --> 1:08:03.989
-Up and down. Up and down.
-Up. That's right. That's right. Yeah.

1:08:04.080 --> 1:08:05.490
This is fun.

1:08:05.539 --> 1:08:08.906
Well, if it's so much fun, I'm gonna
leave it to you and Nora to finish up

1:08:09.001 --> 1:08:12.368
while I go in and take a nice little nap.

1:08:15.174 --> 1:08:18.632
This is the best time
I've ever had in my whole life.

1:08:21.514 --> 1:08:23.050
-It is?
-Yeah.

1:08:24.558 --> 1:08:26.094
Tell him, Nora.

1:08:29.939 --> 1:08:33.147
Pete, Lampie and l have talked it over.

1:08:33.192 --> 1:08:35.649
We feel the time has come
for you to stop running.

1:08:35.694 --> 1:08:37.400
Yes, it's true.

1:08:37.488 --> 1:08:41.822
If it's all right with you,
we'd like you to live here with us.

1:08:43.494 --> 1:08:48.284
Nora, Lampie, do you mean
this could be my real home?

1:08:48.374 --> 1:08:49.989
It certainly does.

1:08:50.042 --> 1:08:51.873
And Elliott, too?

1:08:51.919 --> 1:08:54.581
-Well, I...
-Sure, and Elliott, too.

1:08:55.714 --> 1:08:58.672
But Elliott has to live in the cave.

1:08:58.717 --> 1:09:00.503
All right, he Will.

1:09:04.890 --> 1:09:07.552
No, no, no! Not on me! Not on me!

1:09:07.643 --> 1:09:09.144
On the side of the building, please?

1:09:09.228 --> 1:09:10.263
-Now up...
-And down.

1:09:10.354 --> 1:09:12.345
-Up and down.
-Up and down.

1:09:16.902 --> 1:09:18.403
You know what?

1:09:19.196 --> 1:09:22.063
It’s a brazzle dazzle day

1:09:22.158 --> 1:09:25.901
80 throw off the past
and everything in it

1:09:25.953 --> 1:09:28.990
That’s the brazzle dazzle way

1:09:29.081 --> 1:09:32.869
Enjoying your time
from minute to minute

1:09:32.918 --> 1:09:37.582
Running through the sand
without your shoes on

1:09:37.631 --> 1:09:39.622
Shoes on

1:09:39.717 --> 1:09:44.427
Making sure that you
don ’t keep your blues on

1:09:44.513 --> 1:09:49.473
Finding a boat we can cruise on

1:09:49.560 --> 1:09:52.597
It’s a brazzle dazzle day

1:09:52.688 --> 1:09:56.272
When you think of love
and never of sorrow

1:09:56.317 --> 1:09:59.434
That’s the brazzle dazzle way

1:09:59.486 --> 1:10:01.147
To do your work now

1:10:01.238 --> 1:10:03.354
And take off tomorrow

1:10:03.449 --> 1:10:07.943
Flying through the air
You don ’t need wings on

1:10:08.037 --> 1:10:09.993
Wings on

1:10:10.080 --> 1:10:14.744
Climb right up
and feel the thrill it brings on

1:10:14.793 --> 1:10:19.833
-Rock with the wind as it sings on

1:10:19.924 --> 1:10:23.007

Come on. Come on.

1:12:46.070 --> 1:12:47.276
Come on.

1:12:48.072 --> 1:12:52.691
Whoa, boy. Say, have you seen
anything of a mean, fresh kid

1:12:52.785 --> 1:12:54.491
about yea big?

1:12:55.454 --> 1:12:57.490
Answers to the name of Pete.

1:12:57.581 --> 1:13:00.789
Half of the kids in this town
answer to the name of Pete.

1:13:00.834 --> 1:13:02.574
Other half don't answer.

1:13:02.628 --> 1:13:05.665
-Let me break his bones, Pa!
-Just a minute!

1:13:06.965 --> 1:13:09.672
This particular Pete, he's always talking

1:13:09.760 --> 1:13:13.423
to his big, hokey pokey
whatchamacallit...

1:13:13.472 --> 1:13:14.632
-Dragon.
-Dragon.

1:13:14.681 --> 1:13:16.057
Dragon?

1:13:21.647 --> 1:13:24.605
Merle, this here's the place.

1:13:26.610 --> 1:13:28.225
Come on, Willie.

1:13:39.540 --> 1:13:43.078
It would be unethical of me
to leave my patient at a time like this.

1:13:43.168 --> 1:13:46.660
It's important. About the dragon.

1:13:46.713 --> 1:13:48.578
Put your foot on there.

1:13:49.675 --> 1:13:52.041
Now, don't move, stay tense,
or that weight will fall,

1:13:52.136 --> 1:13:53.546
that clamp will break yourjaw,

1:13:53.637 --> 1:13:55.969
tear your gums apart
and go clean through your cheek.

1:13:56.014 --> 1:13:58.050
Tense. Tense!

1:14:06.942 --> 1:14:09.649
They're looking for the kid
and the dragon.

1:14:09.695 --> 1:14:12.232
I knew there'd be competition.
Come on.

1:14:13.657 --> 1:14:15.693
Careful as you bring them aside.

1:14:15.784 --> 1:14:17.524
lgotone!|gotone!

1:14:27.546 --> 1:14:28.877
lt's ugly!

1:14:28.922 --> 1:14:32.210
Well! If it ain't our own little Petey!

1:14:34.845 --> 1:14:36.176
The Gogans!

1:14:40.517 --> 1:14:44.681
Well, you look so nice and clean,
and those new clothes.

1:14:44.730 --> 1:14:48.439
I guess all those good manners
I taught you done paid off.

1:14:49.359 --> 1:14:52.601
Who's that pretty lady you're with,
little Pete?

1:14:53.655 --> 1:14:56.567
-Yeah. Introduce us.
-Yeah. Introduce us.

1:14:57.784 --> 1:15:01.242
l'm Nora, and Pete is staying with me.

1:15:01.288 --> 1:15:07.409
Why, boys, I believe she's trying to
break up our happy little family.

1:15:07.503 --> 1:15:09.710
Elliott went to look for Paul.

1:15:09.755 --> 1:15:11.165
I wish he were here.

1:15:11.256 --> 1:15:13.838
Don't worry. They won't get you.
Come on, Dad.

1:15:13.926 --> 1:15:16.633
I guess we're gonna
take him back now, miss,

1:15:16.720 --> 1:15:20.508
to his own home, sweet home.
Come on, Pete.

1:15:21.183 --> 1:15:23.549
You won't be taking him anywhere!

1:15:23.602 --> 1:15:28.471
Okay, lady. We're gonna take him
whether you like it or not.

1:15:28.565 --> 1:15:31.102
-Right, boys?
-Right, Pa.

1:15:31.151 --> 1:15:35.895
Willie, you grab onto Pete
while I hold onto her.

1:15:35.948 --> 1:15:39.782
You grab Pete. lwanna hold her.

1:15:39.826 --> 1:15:42.954
-I wanna hold her!
-Well, I'm gonna hold her!

1:15:45.457 --> 1:15:47.288
All right!

1:15:47.376 --> 1:15:49.082
l'll settle this.

1:15:50.212 --> 1:15:52.077
You two grab the brat.

1:15:52.881 --> 1:15:54.667
l'll hold her.

1:15:54.758 --> 1:15:59.343
If you think you're gonna hold her
like my boys wanna hold her,

1:15:59.429 --> 1:16:02.296
you're gonna be holding your head,
you understand?

1:16:02.849 --> 1:16:04.805
Lady, that boy is ours.

1:16:10.274 --> 1:16:12.390
-We got a bill of sale right here
-We got a bill of sale right here

1:16:12.484 --> 1:16:14.770
That says he belongs to us

1:16:15.153 --> 1:16:17.314
We bought him
fair and square last year

1:16:17.406 --> 1:16:19.488
And we own the little cuss

1:16:20.534 --> 1:16:26.120
Look here, read the writing
That gives us a legal claim

1:16:26.164 --> 1:16:28.621
-We got a bill of sale right here
-We got a bill of sale right here

1:16:28.667 --> 1:16:31.249
With dear little Petey’s name

1:16:31.336 --> 1:16:33.998
-You can’t have him
-He’s gotta clean and sweep

1:16:34.047 --> 1:16:36.333
-You don ’t love him
-Feed the hens and comb the sheep

1:16:36.383 --> 1:16:38.624
-All you’ve done up to now
-Plant seeds, pull weeds

1:16:38.677 --> 1:16:40.838
-/s break his heart
-Bow to all our needs

1:16:40.929 --> 1:16:43.306
-You’ll abuse him
-Carry water from the well

1:16:43.348 --> 1:16:46.681
-And just use him
-Answer every time we yell

1:16:46.768 --> 1:16:49.350
Watch out or I’ll take you apart

1:16:49.438 --> 1:16:51.520
We’d like to see you try it

1:16:51.607 --> 1:16:56.397
We got a bill of sale right here
that says he belongs to us

1:16:56.486 --> 1:16:57.521
Fight all you want

1:16:57.571 --> 1:17:00.859
Won ’t do no good
to holler and fume and fuss

1:17:01.783 --> 1:17:07.449
Leave town, keep on going
before / can count to ﬁve

1:17:08.081 --> 1:17:09.742
Come on! Row!

1:17:12.252 --> 1:17:13.833
It's Elliott!

1:17:20.886 --> 1:17:23.377
We got a bill of sale right here

1:17:23.430 --> 1:17:25.887
We got a bill of sale right here

1:17:25.932 --> 1:17:29.299
We got a bill of sale right here

1:17:30.395 --> 1:17:31.851
Right here

1:17:35.484 --> 1:17:40.695
Right here

1:17:47.412 --> 1:17:50.575
lt's downright dangerous
getting all wet like this.

1:17:50.666 --> 1:17:52.827
We done had our bath in May!

1:17:57.130 --> 1:17:58.711
-Bless you, Ma.
-Bless you, Ma.

1:18:01.051 --> 1:18:02.336
Excuse me, folks.

1:18:02.427 --> 1:18:03.928
I witnessed what happened today,

1:18:04.012 --> 1:18:06.344
and I'm completely sympathetic
with you.

1:18:06.431 --> 1:18:08.012
What's "sympathetic" mean?

1:18:08.100 --> 1:18:10.762
l'm Doc Terminus. Like to talk to you.

1:18:10.811 --> 1:18:13.894
Doc, I got this here p'monia.

1:18:13.939 --> 1:18:15.270
Sit down.

1:18:20.404 --> 1:18:22.269
-Bless you, Ma.
-Bless you, Ma.

1:18:25.409 --> 1:18:28.492
I got this terrible ache in my back!

1:18:28.578 --> 1:18:32.070
Good. What's rightfully yours
is rightfully yours.

1:18:32.124 --> 1:18:34.285
Now, you want Pete, right?

1:18:34.334 --> 1:18:36.120
-Right!
-Right!

1:18:36.169 --> 1:18:38.330
I want the dragon.

1:18:39.339 --> 1:18:40.954
-The dragon?
-The dragon?

1:18:47.639 --> 1:18:49.425
Wait, wait, wait a minute.

1:18:49.474 --> 1:18:51.931
Now I got a stitch in my side.

1:18:52.477 --> 1:18:54.638
You really want the dragon?

1:18:54.938 --> 1:18:56.303
Very much.

1:18:56.982 --> 1:18:59.018
Well, then, what are you willing
to give for it?

1:18:59.109 --> 1:19:01.145
The help you need getting Pete.

1:19:01.236 --> 1:19:04.069
I'll need the same kind
of help getting the dragon.

1:19:16.460 --> 1:19:19.418
Now I think the pain's in my head!

1:19:19.504 --> 1:19:21.790
-Have we got a deal?
-Sure.

1:19:22.549 --> 1:19:25.256
We scratch your back,
you scratch ours.

1:19:28.764 --> 1:19:30.971
The boathouse at sunset.

1:19:32.517 --> 1:19:33.848
Doc.

1:19:34.478 --> 1:19:36.594
What you gonna do with a dragon?

1:19:36.688 --> 1:19:39.225
Maybe put him on a ranch, breed him?

1:19:39.316 --> 1:19:40.806
Big stud fees.

1:19:55.582 --> 1:19:58.415
Ahoy. Ahoy. Here.

1:20:02.214 --> 1:20:04.956
How would you like to make
the fishing good again?

1:20:05.050 --> 1:20:08.213
-How do we do that?
-Catch that dragon!

1:20:08.261 --> 1:20:12.049
Set a trap for him, throw a net over him,
drag him away.

1:20:12.098 --> 1:20:15.590
Goodbye, Elliott. Hello, fish.

1:20:15.685 --> 1:20:18.677
Sunset, the boathouse.
Spread the word.

1:20:22.150 --> 1:20:23.390
-Okay.
-Right.

1:20:23.443 --> 1:20:25.399
-|t's a good idea.
-Yeah.

1:20:48.218 --> 1:20:50.209
Get back! Get back!

1:20:55.851 --> 1:20:59.935
Dr. Terminus!
Here's that there harpoon you wanted!

1:21:00.021 --> 1:21:02.307
Good! Put it right over there!

1:21:04.025 --> 1:21:06.357
Now you just remember our bargain!

1:21:08.363 --> 1:21:11.571
Okay, I want separate trip lines
on the primary tarp,

1:21:11.616 --> 1:21:14.358
the secondary net and on the tertiary.

1:21:14.452 --> 1:21:16.317
-Tertiary?
-What's that?

1:21:17.372 --> 1:21:18.737
Dragon medicine.

1:21:21.293 --> 1:21:23.409
-Okay, fix it.
-We've done it!

1:21:23.461 --> 1:21:25.588
Don't signal till you're...

1:21:27.549 --> 1:21:29.915
Get this net up off of me!

1:21:29.968 --> 1:21:34.632
Will you get this...
Will you get this net up! Up! Up!

1:21:34.723 --> 1:21:36.304
Now, I've got to go and get that kid.

1:21:36.391 --> 1:21:39.258
You rehearse this and make it run
like clockwork or else.

1:21:59.915 --> 1:22:01.325
Elliott!

1:22:05.003 --> 1:22:09.121
Elliott, you were terrific
the way you saved us from the Gogans.

1:22:10.216 --> 1:22:11.717
What?

1:22:16.014 --> 1:22:17.470
Do you mean it?

1:22:20.435 --> 1:22:22.016
Wow! That's great.

1:22:22.103 --> 1:22:25.436
You're the most wonderful dragon
in the whole world.

1:22:27.859 --> 1:22:29.770
Wait till I tell Nora!

1:22:36.785 --> 1:22:39.197
Nora! Nora! Good news!

1:22:39.287 --> 1:22:42.199
Elliott found Paul,
and he's on his way home!

1:22:44.417 --> 1:22:45.497
Pete...

1:22:45.543 --> 1:22:47.750
I wouldn't say anything like that
if I were you.

1:22:47.837 --> 1:22:50.453
But it's true. Elliott said.

1:22:51.466 --> 1:22:52.831
Please.

1:22:53.760 --> 1:22:57.378
There's been enough talk
about Paul, and Elliott too.

1:23:00.934 --> 1:23:04.392
Both of us have to be realistic.

1:23:05.772 --> 1:23:09.731
Paul's ship went down.
He's not coming back.

1:23:11.319 --> 1:23:13.696
And l have to adjust my life to it.

1:23:14.572 --> 1:23:17.814
You have to make
a big adjustment, too.

1:23:17.909 --> 1:23:20.195
You have us now.

1:23:20.245 --> 1:23:24.079
You don't have to make believe
your only friend is a dragon.

1:23:24.165 --> 1:23:26.827
But I'm not making believe.

1:23:26.918 --> 1:23:29.250
That's what I mean by "realistic."

1:23:29.295 --> 1:23:31.251
There are no dragons.

1:23:31.840 --> 1:23:34.957
Except for Elliott. He's real.

1:23:35.051 --> 1:23:37.588
Lampie, you've seen him, haven't you?

1:23:42.267 --> 1:23:43.598
Well, I...

1:23:46.896 --> 1:23:48.682
I thought I saw him.

1:23:53.028 --> 1:23:57.317
Wait till Paul gets here.
Then you'll know how realistic Elliott is.

1:23:59.951 --> 1:24:01.532
Okay.

1:24:01.619 --> 1:24:05.953
Until that time,
let's try not to talk about it.

1:24:08.293 --> 1:24:11.126
How about filling the reserve oilcan?

1:24:11.212 --> 1:24:12.463
Sure.

1:24:16.843 --> 1:24:20.335
Well, at least one of us
is entitled to have illusions.

1:24:34.527 --> 1:24:36.392
Pete! Pete, it's Elliott!

1:24:36.488 --> 1:24:39.150
-What's the matter?
-Elliott's in Passapaka... Pakadaka...

1:24:39.199 --> 1:24:41.656
He's in town,
and he's tearing the place apart.

1:24:41.701 --> 1:24:43.657
-You've got to do something.
-No!

1:24:59.928 --> 1:25:02.010
We should be in the channel.

1:25:02.680 --> 1:25:05.513
We should've made
Passamaquoddy light by now.

1:25:06.601 --> 1:25:08.842
I know the light-keepers personally.

1:25:10.522 --> 1:25:13.685
-He's in there! Come on!
-Elliott! Elliott!

1:25:16.152 --> 1:25:19.064
Didn't you say the primary
was really the tertiary?

1:25:21.741 --> 1:25:23.197
Never!

1:25:27.372 --> 1:25:30.239
-Where's Elliott?
-Nowhere!

1:25:30.333 --> 1:25:34.076
Your hokey-pokey dragon's
out helping Santa Claus pull his sled!

1:25:34.170 --> 1:25:36.377
-Boys!
-Let me go!

1:25:36.464 --> 1:25:38.500
Now you're never
gonna get away again!

1:25:38.550 --> 1:25:40.836
We're gonna put chains on you
when you're working!

1:25:40.885 --> 1:25:43.342
-And when you're not working.
-And when you're sleeping!

1:25:43.388 --> 1:25:46.130
Okay, okay.
Tear him to pieces in your own time.

1:25:46.224 --> 1:25:48.431
Right now he is the bait for the trap.

1:25:48.518 --> 1:25:50.008
Take him in there
where that thing can see him

1:25:50.061 --> 1:25:51.267
when he comes through the door.

1:25:51.354 --> 1:25:53.720
He'll head straight for Pete.
We spring the trap.

1:25:53.773 --> 1:25:57.231
After the tertiary net drops on him,
I'll give you the signal,

1:25:57.318 --> 1:26:00.401
and you fire that harpoon
right into the middle.

1:26:00.488 --> 1:26:01.648
No! No!

1:26:01.739 --> 1:26:04.401
Yes! Yes! Got it?

1:26:04.951 --> 1:26:06.191
Got it!

1:26:06.870 --> 1:26:10.863
What I don't got is,
how you gonna get that monster,

1:26:10.915 --> 1:26:15.955
that hideous beast, that nightmare
sent by the devil, to come here?

1:26:17.422 --> 1:26:20.539
Easy. We get someone he knows
to bring him here.

1:26:21.259 --> 1:26:23.671
Well, who'd be crazy enough
to do that?

1:26:24.596 --> 1:26:27.963
No! No!

1:26:28.057 --> 1:26:30.890
He knows you. He trusts you.

1:26:31.394 --> 1:26:35.433
He scares me! He hates me!

1:26:36.774 --> 1:26:38.059
Hoagy.

1:26:38.985 --> 1:26:41.943
We are all on this Earth for a purpose,

1:26:42.030 --> 1:26:44.646
and the time for your purpose is now.

1:26:45.408 --> 1:26:49.822
I know that inside this pale, frail,
pathetic shell of a man

1:26:49.913 --> 1:26:52.996
there is a Vesuvius ready to erupt.

1:26:53.082 --> 1:26:57.792
Now, I've known you, man and beast,
since you were nothing.

1:26:57.837 --> 1:27:02.922
But now, Hoagy, now,
you're still nothing,

1:27:03.927 --> 1:27:06.464
but you could be something!

1:27:06.554 --> 1:27:08.966
You can be a somebody.

1:27:09.057 --> 1:27:10.718
A legend, Hoagy.

1:27:10.808 --> 1:27:14.767
A legend in your own lifetime,
not a joke!

1:27:14.812 --> 1:27:17.303
The moment's here, Hoagy.

1:27:17.398 --> 1:27:19.309
Grab it. Grab it!

1:27:19.359 --> 1:27:23.728
Today, the jester. Tomorrow, the king!

1:27:28.952 --> 1:27:31.409
-No!
-Get out!

1:27:52.976 --> 1:27:54.432
Elliott.

1:27:54.519 --> 1:27:57.727
Can you come out here for a second?
Please?

1:28:21.671 --> 1:28:22.911
Wake up.

1:28:24.340 --> 1:28:25.876
Wake up!

1:28:30.888 --> 1:28:33.265
Don't get nervous!

1:28:33.349 --> 1:28:35.385
I'm a friend.

1:28:37.395 --> 1:28:40.478
Don't roast me!

1:28:50.700 --> 1:28:51.860
Honest.

1:28:52.660 --> 1:28:58.121
I got a message about Pete!

1:29:00.084 --> 1:29:02.871
The Gogans

1:29:04.797 --> 1:29:07.584
got Pete!

1:29:22.940 --> 1:29:24.066
Follow me!

1:29:48.800 --> 1:29:51.633
There's a reef between us
and the channel.

1:29:51.677 --> 1:29:53.542
Dad, I can't find Pete.

1:29:56.140 --> 1:29:59.223
-Can you get it lit?
-l have to put in a dry wick.

1:30:02.188 --> 1:30:03.769
Battle stations!

1:30:06.859 --> 1:30:09.646
I told you! I told you, Elliott!
There he is!

1:30:09.737 --> 1:30:11.648
Look out, Elliott! It's a trap!

1:30:12.740 --> 1:30:14.651
Get him! He's right here!

1:30:15.868 --> 1:30:17.404
Drop everything!

1:30:19.038 --> 1:30:20.949
Drop everything!

1:30:27.505 --> 1:30:29.211
Elliott, over here!

1:30:31.509 --> 1:30:34.797
Get me out of here!
Elliott, don't step on me!

1:30:37.056 --> 1:30:39.843
Am I seeing what I think I'm seeing?

1:30:39.934 --> 1:30:41.925
lt's beginning to look like a...

1:30:42.019 --> 1:30:43.805
-Dragon!
-Don't say that!

1:30:44.105 --> 1:30:45.561
I've got it!

1:30:46.482 --> 1:30:47.688
Out!

1:30:47.733 --> 1:30:49.689
We've got it! We've got it!

1:30:50.153 --> 1:30:52.690
-Hoagy!
-Please! Please, let me out!

1:30:53.197 --> 1:30:56.940
-Doc, please!
-Get out of there! Get out of there!

1:30:57.785 --> 1:31:00.777
Doc, get me out! Get me out!
Get me out!

1:31:00.872 --> 1:31:02.328
Okay. Okay!

1:31:12.049 --> 1:31:13.835
Help! Elliott, help!

1:31:17.388 --> 1:31:19.424
Man this harpoon. Take this.

1:31:22.393 --> 1:31:23.724
Light the fuse.

1:31:26.397 --> 1:31:28.513
No, no! Don't shoot Elliott!

1:31:31.986 --> 1:31:33.567
Get him back!

1:31:35.072 --> 1:31:37.063
-Get him back!
-Get him outside!

1:31:37.617 --> 1:31:39.323
Come on, Grover!

1:31:43.080 --> 1:31:44.286
Pick him up!

1:31:44.373 --> 1:31:46.910
Come on! Take him outside!

1:31:50.171 --> 1:31:51.786
Get out of the way!

1:31:55.218 --> 1:31:58.051
He's going! Let me get a bead on him!

1:32:00.640 --> 1:32:01.925
Elliott, save me!

1:32:02.016 --> 1:32:04.974
Don't let him get away again!
Get him out of here!

1:32:13.861 --> 1:32:17.445
-Hands...
-Elliott, don't let them take me!

1:32:30.378 --> 1:32:32.084
Wait! Wait!

1:32:48.813 --> 1:32:50.269
Pete!

1:32:53.484 --> 1:32:55.065
Thanks, Elliott.

1:32:55.611 --> 1:32:58.728
You just listen to me!
That there boy belongs to me!

1:32:58.823 --> 1:33:01.906
I paid $50 for him plus legals,

1:33:01.993 --> 1:33:05.485
and I got a bill of sale right here,
right here to prove it.

1:33:22.013 --> 1:33:25.426
Merle, help! Don'tjust stand there!

1:33:25.516 --> 1:33:28.007
You dimwits! Come on! Come on!
Get me out of here!

1:33:28.519 --> 1:33:30.680
Get me out of here, clucks!

1:33:40.948 --> 1:33:42.859
Let him keep the brat!

1:33:44.869 --> 1:33:46.825
Come on! Get in the wagon!

1:33:48.539 --> 1:33:50.746
I'll never touch him again.

1:33:50.833 --> 1:33:53.700
Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait for us!
I said, "Wait!"

1:34:42.718 --> 1:34:45.710
Hoagy, get me down!

1:34:45.763 --> 1:34:49.255
We've got to do something!
That dragon's gonna get away!

1:34:53.312 --> 1:34:55.428
He's gonna eat us up!

1:35:15.960 --> 1:35:18.997
...in the street. Quite a storm here.

1:35:19.088 --> 1:35:20.794
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait.

1:35:20.881 --> 1:35:22.382
Watch those stairs.

1:35:28.681 --> 1:35:29.966
Look!

1:35:41.068 --> 1:35:42.649
There really is a dragon!

1:35:42.695 --> 1:35:44.936
Yes, and he saved us!

1:35:44.989 --> 1:35:47.401
-Dragon!
-A dragon! A real dragon!

1:35:48.784 --> 1:35:50.615
Attaboy, Elliott.

1:36:00.671 --> 1:36:02.411
That ship's headed for the reef!

1:36:02.506 --> 1:36:04.542
Go down and sound the foghorn!

1:36:12.850 --> 1:36:14.932
Elliott, quick! Quick!

1:36:38.709 --> 1:36:42.042
Nora, let me have the light
so I can see what I'm doing.

1:36:56.644 --> 1:36:59.351
Come on, Elliott. You can do it.

1:37:04.151 --> 1:37:05.561
I got it!

1:37:09.865 --> 1:37:11.730
Come on, Elliott.

1:37:21.418 --> 1:37:23.158
Come on, Elliott!

1:37:25.464 --> 1:37:26.795
Hurry!

1:37:28.759 --> 1:37:30.090
What's the matter?

1:37:30.135 --> 1:37:32.877
Everything is wet in here,
that's what's the matter!

1:37:32.930 --> 1:37:36.388
-Don't worry, Lampie. Elliott came.
-Elliott?

1:37:36.433 --> 1:37:39.596
That's all I need is a dragon in here.

1:37:41.939 --> 1:37:43.600
Get him out of here!

1:37:45.192 --> 1:37:48.059
Start your burner, Elliott. Light the wick.

1:37:51.991 --> 1:37:55.233
All right, Elliott. Go ahead. Light it.

1:37:59.874 --> 1:38:01.614
Now, Elliott! Now!

1:38:03.127 --> 1:38:05.288
All right. Where's the fire?

1:38:05.838 --> 1:38:07.203
What's the matter?

1:38:11.635 --> 1:38:14.047
He's all squished up in the stairs.

1:38:35.242 --> 1:38:37.073
Elliott?

1:38:39.038 --> 1:38:41.575
He's real. He's really real.

1:38:43.751 --> 1:38:46.208
Of course he is.
He's gonna light the wick.

1:38:46.295 --> 1:38:47.831
Can he do it?

1:38:47.922 --> 1:38:51.164
Can he? He can throw a flame clear
across to Bar Harbour,

1:38:51.258 --> 1:38:53.465
if he can get his own burner going!

1:39:01.685 --> 1:39:05.177
-Come on, Elliott!
-Come on!

1:39:05.439 --> 1:39:06.940
Blow, Elliott!

1:39:21.288 --> 1:39:23.199
Elliott, you did it!

1:39:30.172 --> 1:39:31.537
Look there!

1:39:35.094 --> 1:39:37.927
That means the rocks
are dead ahead, Captain!

1:39:40.391 --> 1:39:42.473
Hard right rudder!

1:39:52.611 --> 1:39:57.105
Elliott, I could give you a great big kiss.

1:40:20.514 --> 1:40:23.551
A dragon, a dragon
You bet we saw a dragon

1:40:23.600 --> 1:40:27.218
80 big and brave
he came to save a village in distress

1:40:27.271 --> 1:40:30.855
He kept the ship from crashing
when he heard the S. O. S.

1:40:30.941 --> 1:40:34.559
He faced a group of villains
and he fought them with success

1:40:34.611 --> 1:40:36.442
-He’s great
-He’s great

1:40:36.488 --> 1:40:37.523
-A chum
-A pal

1:40:37.614 --> 1:40:38.603
A mate

1:40:38.657 --> 1:40:41.865
A dragon, a dragon
We ’re proud to love a dragon

1:40:41.952 --> 1:40:45.536
Before he came to ﬁght the storm
the night was dark and dim

1:40:49.293 --> 1:40:52.911
He ﬁlled the ocean full of ﬁsh
He packed it to the brim

1:40:52.963 --> 1:40:56.797
We want it known
that he’s our very own

1:40:57.259 --> 1:41:00.626
Nora! Nora!

1:41:03.015 --> 1:41:04.505
Paul!

1:41:14.818 --> 1:41:16.149
Gather around, everyone.

1:41:16.236 --> 1:41:18.192
l have a few appropriate words to say.

1:41:18.280 --> 1:41:20.737
Gather around. Come on.
Closer, closer.

1:41:24.119 --> 1:41:27.828
Ladies... Ladies and gentlemen,

1:41:27.873 --> 1:41:30.740
Pete, I want you to thank
Elliott the dragon

1:41:30.834 --> 1:41:33.086
for the council here
and all the townspeople.

1:41:33.170 --> 1:41:35.912
-You do that?
-Well, he's right here.

1:41:36.006 --> 1:41:39.669
He'd appreciate it
if you'd thank him yourself.

1:41:39.718 --> 1:41:42.551
You mean I can talk right to him?

1:41:42.638 --> 1:41:45.471
Go right to the main source.
That was my campaign.

1:41:46.934 --> 1:41:49.767
-No, he's over here.
-Over that side.

1:41:49.853 --> 1:41:52.390
So, Elliott, on behalf of...

1:41:56.068 --> 1:41:57.558
Thank you. Thank you.

1:41:58.403 --> 1:42:01.361
It’s a brazzle dazzle day

1:42:01.448 --> 1:42:04.986
80 throw off the past
and everything in it

1:42:05.035 --> 1:42:08.152
That’s the brazzle dazzle way

1:42:08.205 --> 1:42:11.743
Enjoying your time
from minute to minute

1:42:13.460 --> 1:42:14.575
Hi!

1:42:17.214 --> 1:42:19.546
Elliott, you're the greatest.

1:42:19.591 --> 1:42:22.879
You've made everybody happy,
especially me.

1:42:24.221 --> 1:42:26.303
I'm very proud of you.

1:42:29.059 --> 1:42:32.597
We've got a real family now
and a place to live.

1:42:42.614 --> 1:42:46.357
You've got to go?
When will you be back?

1:42:58.839 --> 1:43:00.875
You won't be back?

1:43:05.012 --> 1:43:06.502
But why?

1:43:07.973 --> 1:43:09.929
Did I do something wrong?

1:43:17.941 --> 1:43:20.227
There's another kid in trouble?

1:43:26.825 --> 1:43:29.942
Well, if anyone can get him out of it,
you can.

1:43:40.172 --> 1:43:43.460
I won't see you again, will I?

1:43:45.093 --> 1:43:46.128
Ever

1:43:56.313 --> 1:43:58.304
What are you sniffing for?

1:44:09.243 --> 1:44:11.985
Now, remember, don't scare people.

1:44:27.928 --> 1:44:30.340
Goodbye, Elliott. Goodbye.

1:44:49.199 --> 1:44:50.405
It is a dragon!

1:44:50.492 --> 1:44:52.073
-lt's Elliott!
-lt's Elliott!

1:44:54.746 --> 1:44:57.863
And remember,
you're supposed to be invisible!
