18:35.549 --> 18:37.420
There is?

18:37.464 --> 18:38.900
Well, what are we
gonna find in there?

18:38.943 --> 18:41.250
We already know about
Sandra's criminal past.

18:41.294 --> 18:43.513
Yes, but what about
her criminal present?

18:43.557 --> 18:47.038
Sandra paid cash for her house,
then two years later,

18:47.082 --> 18:49.693
paid back the Korean mob,
with interest.

18:49.737 --> 18:51.695
Right. How'd she
get that money?

18:51.739 --> 18:54.437
Exactly. You can't do that
on a chemistry teacher's salary.

18:54.481 --> 18:55.917
So, what do we think?

18:55.960 --> 18:57.571
She was hacking into banks?

18:57.614 --> 19:01.357
Or she decided to dust off her
old skill of cooking Ecstasy.

19:01.401 --> 19:03.054
Right.
Okay.

19:03.098 --> 19:04.578
Now that we know what
we're looking for,

19:04.621 --> 19:07.407
let's try to find proof
that she was still making

19:07.450 --> 19:09.974
and now selling drugs.

19:10.018 --> 19:12.368
Huh. That's weird.

19:12.412 --> 19:14.457
It's not connecting.

19:14.501 --> 19:16.198
Oh, let me have a look at it.

19:16.242 --> 19:18.069
Oh, Lucifer,
please don't mess with it.

19:18.113 --> 19:19.462
What does this do, anyway?

19:19.506 --> 19:21.899
Stop shaking it.
You're gonna break it.

19:23.118 --> 19:25.860
Ah, you're right, Detective.

19:25.903 --> 19:28.428
It does help to know
what you're looking for.

19:30.299 --> 19:34.085
Are those client lists? Ooh.

19:34.129 --> 19:36.566
Well, an angry one, maybe.

19:36.610 --> 19:38.307
"I know what you're doing.

19:38.351 --> 19:39.656
End it or you're dead."

19:39.700 --> 19:41.571
Ooh.

19:41.615 --> 19:44.400
So, you can take the girl
out of the Ecstasy biz,

19:44.444 --> 19:46.185
but you can't take
the Ecstasy biz out of the girl.

19:46.228 --> 19:47.969
LUCIFER: Well, actually,
it's not Ecstasy.

19:48.012 --> 19:50.319
It's more sort of
a homebrew Adderall.

19:50.363 --> 19:51.886
It's very smooth. [sniffs]

19:51.929 --> 19:54.105
Did your partner just admit
to snorting evidence?

19:54.149 --> 19:57.500
The only thing I admit to is
being very focused on this case.

19:57.544 --> 19:59.198
CHLOE:
We think Sandra adjusted

19:59.241 --> 20:01.330
her product
to her new environment.

20:01.374 --> 20:02.984
Type-A moms,
high-pressure dads...

20:03.027 --> 20:05.334
And all the Ivy League-bound
brats in between.

20:05.378 --> 20:07.771
And if she was selling,
these death threats suggest

20:07.815 --> 20:10.383
that someone didn't want
those drugs in the neighborhood.

20:10.426 --> 20:12.515
We think she was trying
to determine who sent them.

20:12.559 --> 20:13.951
And maybe looking
got her killed.

20:13.995 --> 20:15.475
All right.
Get close to the neighbors.

20:15.518 --> 20:17.259
See who you can smoke out.

20:17.303 --> 20:18.652
Right. I-I had
the exact same idea,

20:18.695 --> 20:20.480
and there is a house for rent
on Sandra's block.

20:20.523 --> 20:23.352
However, the owner will
only rent to couples.

20:23.396 --> 20:24.788
Great. You and Lucifer
are on it.

20:24.832 --> 20:25.963
No, I'd love to,

20:26.007 --> 20:26.921
but I canvassed the
entire neighborhood.

20:26.964 --> 20:28.357
They know I'm
a cop. Dan, too.

20:28.401 --> 20:30.098
So find another officer
with knowledge of this case

20:30.141 --> 20:31.099
to go undercover.

20:31.142 --> 20:32.318
LUCIFER:
Oh, don't worry.

20:32.361 --> 20:34.363
We already have.

20:34.407 --> 20:36.887
Hey, hey.

20:36.931 --> 20:38.106
It's the welcome wagon.

20:38.149 --> 20:39.542
Yeah, but not
in the lame way.

20:39.586 --> 20:41.849
[chuckles] We just want
to be the first to say hi

20:41.892 --> 20:44.243
to the, uh, new couple
on the block.

20:44.286 --> 20:46.332
I'm Brian.
This is my wife Anya.
Hey.

20:46.375 --> 20:49.857
Thank you.
That is so thoughtful.

20:49.900 --> 20:51.162
Honey!

20:51.206 --> 20:52.903
We have guests.

20:52.947 --> 20:57.168
Ah. Right. Brian and
Anya, this is Marc.

20:57.212 --> 20:59.954
Hi. Oh.
[chuckles]

21:06.439 --> 21:08.223
Oh. [sniffs]

21:08.267 --> 21:09.833
Mmm.

21:09.877 --> 21:11.400
All right.

21:11.444 --> 21:13.402
What, plastic plates?

21:13.446 --> 21:14.577
What are we, barbarians?

21:14.621 --> 21:15.752
Don't we have any
china in there?

21:15.796 --> 21:17.319
You know this
isn't real, right?

21:17.363 --> 21:18.494
I mea...
[scoffs]

21:18.538 --> 21:20.409
You realize this is
just for the case.

21:20.453 --> 21:23.717
This is my chance
to really get to know you.

21:23.760 --> 21:25.545
Pierce, I'm taking
it seriously

21:25.588 --> 21:27.938
and so should you for our cause

21:27.982 --> 21:29.418
and for the case, obviously.

21:29.462 --> 21:32.203
So, let's just get in there
and put on a good show.

21:32.247 --> 21:33.988
Shall we? Just
don't give me

21:34.031 --> 21:35.729
your resting Pierce face.

21:35.772 --> 21:36.904
What face?

21:39.776 --> 21:43.127
So, how did you two
lovebirds meet?

21:43.171 --> 21:44.607
We were high school
sweethearts, actually.

21:44.651 --> 21:47.871
LUCIFER: Aw.We were biology partners.

21:47.915 --> 21:50.134
He asked me out while we
were dissecting a crayfish.

21:50.178 --> 21:53.137
[laughs]My wife. Oh, the stuff
she remembers.

21:53.181 --> 21:55.401
[Brian chuckles]How about you?
How'd you two meet?

21:55.444 --> 21:57.403
At work.Well, um, actually,

21:57.446 --> 21:59.100
we met through my Dad.

21:59.143 --> 22:00.231
ANYA:
Oh!

22:00.275 --> 22:01.450
So sweet.LUCIFER:
Well, not really.

22:01.494 --> 22:03.234
My Dad's a right bastard.

22:03.278 --> 22:04.845
BRIAN:
Oh, right, yes.

22:04.888 --> 22:06.890
Tough, right?
When parents don't approve.

22:06.934 --> 22:08.936
It's true. True.
And my Father would definitely

22:08.979 --> 22:10.329
disapprove of this.

22:10.372 --> 22:11.417
Isn't that right, Marky Marc?

22:11.460 --> 22:14.202
Well, let's not start with that

22:14.245 --> 22:16.726
with these
nice people, Luke.

22:16.770 --> 22:19.686
[sighs] I'm sorry. Marc loathes
talking about himself.

22:19.729 --> 22:20.991
[quietly]:
He's shy.

22:21.035 --> 22:22.341
[normal volume]:
But don't let that put you off.

22:22.384 --> 22:23.733
I mean, we are
neighbors now, after all.

22:23.777 --> 22:25.213
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
[chuckles]

22:25.256 --> 22:29.043
Feel free to ask him--
I mean, us-- anything you want.

22:29.086 --> 22:30.349
Okay.
All right.

22:30.392 --> 22:31.828
Shall we?
Yes.BRIAN: Yes.

22:31.872 --> 22:33.395
All right.

22:34.309 --> 22:35.397
ANYA:
Thank you.

22:35.441 --> 22:37.399
LUCIFER:
Smells delicious.

22:38.531 --> 22:40.620
DAN:
Ah, I get it.

22:40.663 --> 22:42.535
You know,
when Chloe and I got divorced,

22:42.578 --> 22:44.450
I was so worried about Trixie.

22:44.493 --> 22:46.669
What she would think,
when I would see her.

22:46.713 --> 22:49.150
But I realized,
it's the quality of the time,

22:49.193 --> 22:50.673
not the quantity, you know?

22:50.717 --> 22:52.675
I'm really glad
we did this, Dan.

22:52.719 --> 22:55.069
You're such a nice, normal guy.

22:55.112 --> 22:56.636
[both chuckle]

22:56.679 --> 22:58.594
Well, thank you, I think.

22:58.638 --> 23:00.901
I meant that as a compliment.Mm-hmm.

23:00.944 --> 23:03.686
I mean, after
the past few months,

23:03.730 --> 23:08.038
normal is exactly
what I need in my life.

23:08.082 --> 23:09.126
[chair clatters]

23:11.259 --> 23:13.348
Hey, sexy.

23:13.392 --> 23:14.436
What's up, Dan?

23:14.480 --> 23:15.959
CHARLOTTE:
Uh, hello.

23:16.003 --> 23:19.006
You two know each other.

23:19.049 --> 23:20.094
MAZE:
Oh, yeah.

23:20.137 --> 23:22.096
We, uh, killed a guy
together once.

23:22.139 --> 23:22.836
[chuckles]

23:22.879 --> 23:24.272
[laughs]

23:24.315 --> 23:25.404
Maze...

23:25.447 --> 23:26.622
No.

23:26.666 --> 23:29.320
Uh, what she means is,

23:29.364 --> 23:30.452
we had a killer time,

23:30.496 --> 23:32.149
together, once.

23:32.193 --> 23:33.412
[nervous laugh]

23:33.455 --> 23:34.717
Why are you here, Maze?

23:34.761 --> 23:36.415
Isn't it obvious?

23:41.942 --> 23:43.204
The three of us?

23:43.247 --> 23:45.206
[exhales]
I'm sorry.

23:46.294 --> 23:47.730
Did we...?

23:47.774 --> 23:48.731
Oh, no.

23:48.775 --> 23:50.559
No. No, no, no, no, we didn't.

23:50.603 --> 23:52.431
No. Course n...

23:52.474 --> 23:55.216
But if you wanted to...

23:55.259 --> 23:56.565
um,

23:56.609 --> 23:59.481
now-- whatever...

23:59.525 --> 24:01.570
you're into.

24:01.614 --> 24:04.007
I have heard that it's--
can be empowering

24:04.051 --> 24:07.010
'cause I've-I've been reading
this, uh, feminist social...

24:07.054 --> 24:08.229
Well, I'm into it.

24:09.404 --> 24:11.580
If she is.

24:12.755 --> 24:15.628
[exhales]
It's ho... hot.

24:17.325 --> 24:20.110
Oh... uh, can I have
another drink, please?

24:20.154 --> 24:21.503
Thanks.

24:21.547 --> 24:23.244
LUCIFER:
Milano?

24:23.287 --> 24:25.507
Ooh. They're aren't any nuts
in there, are there?

24:25.551 --> 24:27.335
I-I blow up like a balloon.

24:27.378 --> 24:28.684
Of course, allergies.

24:28.728 --> 24:30.294
Yeah.I didn't think
of that.

24:30.338 --> 24:33.297
What makes us vulnerable is
often right under our noses.

24:33.341 --> 24:34.690
Shellfish, maybe?

24:34.734 --> 24:36.257
Huh?

24:36.300 --> 24:37.998
Bees? Latex?

24:38.041 --> 24:40.217
Oh, you know I don't have
any allergies, sweetie.

24:40.261 --> 24:42.219
Let's talk about this
lovely community.

24:42.263 --> 24:43.438
You seem so tightknit.

24:43.482 --> 24:45.092
Yes, yes. It must
have been devastating

24:45.135 --> 24:48.312
when that poor woman was found
ground up like hamburger meat.

24:48.356 --> 24:49.749
Our Realtor told us.

24:49.792 --> 24:51.185
Yeah, it was horrible.
Huge loss. We're...

24:51.228 --> 24:54.362
we're kind of one
big family around here.

24:54.405 --> 24:55.885
ANYA:
Well, most of us, anyway.

24:55.929 --> 24:58.148
Some of the neighbors
can be a little uptight.

24:58.192 --> 25:00.977
Ah, come on, babe, the guys
don't want to hear about that.

25:01.021 --> 25:02.631
Right? We're here
to welcome 'em.

25:02.675 --> 25:04.328
Hear about what?The Neighborhood
Watchdog.

25:04.372 --> 25:08.550
Someone has been writing notes
and terrorizing the block.

25:08.594 --> 25:10.639
Uh, "Trim your
hedges, or else."

25:10.683 --> 25:12.641
"Stop using non-organic
weed killer,

25:12.685 --> 25:14.164
or I'll make you drink it."

25:14.208 --> 25:16.993
This Watchdog seems rather
preoccupied with gardening.

25:17.037 --> 25:20.301
No. People have been getting
notes for all kinds of things.

25:20.344 --> 25:22.999
Uh, loud music, parking,

25:23.043 --> 25:24.479
holiday decor.

25:24.523 --> 25:28.309
it's like Martha Stewart
and the Terminator had a baby.

25:28.352 --> 25:29.571
[laughs]

25:29.615 --> 25:31.312
Any idea who
this "Watchdog" is?

25:31.355 --> 25:32.966
No, actually.

25:33.009 --> 25:34.358
Well, I suppose
we all have our mysteries.

25:34.402 --> 25:35.664
Don't we? Speaking of,

25:35.708 --> 25:37.666
wouldn't you two
like to know more

25:37.710 --> 25:39.407
about this little enigma?

25:39.450 --> 25:40.539
Hmm?
Well,

25:40.582 --> 25:41.888
this has been nice.

25:41.931 --> 25:43.367
Um, but remember,
we have to get get up early

25:43.411 --> 25:44.455
for that thing tomorrow morning.

25:44.499 --> 25:46.196
LUCIFER:
Uh...

25:46.240 --> 25:50.157
No idea what you're
talking about, darling.

25:50.200 --> 25:51.288
[sighs]

25:51.332 --> 25:52.420
[chuckles]

25:52.463 --> 25:54.553
BARTENDER:
Here you go.

25:56.642 --> 25:58.731
[inhales]

26:00.646 --> 26:01.690
[sighs]

26:01.734 --> 26:03.779
I thought you went
to the bathroom.

26:05.476 --> 26:06.826
No.
[chuckles]

26:06.869 --> 26:11.134
I'm sorry, I just...
needed a few minutes.

26:12.919 --> 26:17.924
Truth is, I've...
been through hell lately.

26:21.101 --> 26:22.624
That's it.

26:22.668 --> 26:24.713
No wonder
I wanted you.

26:24.757 --> 26:25.758
That's it.

26:25.801 --> 26:27.847
I can smell it on you.

26:27.890 --> 26:31.415
The pain, the torment.

26:31.459 --> 26:33.417
What, it's that obvious?

26:33.461 --> 26:34.505
Girl,

26:34.549 --> 26:35.898
it is all over you.

26:35.942 --> 26:37.857
[laughs softly]
I guess I thought I was doing

26:37.900 --> 26:41.077
a better job of covering it up.

26:41.121 --> 26:43.166
You see, um...

26:43.210 --> 26:44.994
I died recently,

26:45.038 --> 26:49.999
or... well, almost... died.

26:50.043 --> 26:52.959
And since then,
it's been a struggle

26:53.002 --> 26:55.614
to get my life back
to some semblance of normal.

26:55.657 --> 26:57.006
That's what you want?

26:57.050 --> 26:58.268
Normal.

26:58.312 --> 27:01.271
Yes. Please, God, yes.

27:01.315 --> 27:02.403
Well,

27:02.446 --> 27:03.665
I am definitely not God.

27:03.709 --> 27:04.927
Or normal.

27:04.971 --> 27:06.755
So, guess I'm out.

27:06.799 --> 27:08.670
Oh, y-you are?

27:08.714 --> 27:10.193
I just...

27:10.237 --> 27:12.456
I just told you

37:22.152 --> 37:23.806
and I got so,

37:23.850 --> 37:27.375
so angry I just... shoved her,
and then she...

37:27.419 --> 37:29.159
she hit her head.

37:29.203 --> 37:31.597
But I d--
I didn't mean to kill her.

37:31.640 --> 37:32.772
I just...

37:32.815 --> 37:35.688
I just didn't want you
to leave me.

37:35.731 --> 37:38.299
But he wasn't having an affair.

37:38.343 --> 37:39.953
June was his drug dealer.

37:41.389 --> 37:43.522
It's true.

37:43.565 --> 37:46.351
I was buying pills from her
to help me lose weight.

37:46.394 --> 37:48.701
For you, so that I could
go back to being the guy

37:48.744 --> 37:50.746
that you fell in love
with in high school.

37:50.790 --> 37:53.706
I didn't want you
to leave me.

37:53.749 --> 37:56.056
I'm so sorry
I doubted you.

37:56.099 --> 38:00.887
I just... I don't know what
I would do without you.

38:00.930 --> 38:04.325
Neither do I. Oh...

38:04.369 --> 38:05.892
[crying]

38:05.935 --> 38:07.894
Okay, show's over.

38:07.937 --> 38:09.156
[handcuffs clicking]

38:09.199 --> 38:10.331
Yeah, I suppose there's
some cold comfort

38:10.375 --> 38:12.202
in them being
arrested together.

38:12.246 --> 38:14.335
At least they've got each other.

38:15.815 --> 38:18.774
Yeah, they do.

38:26.042 --> 38:27.435
Dan?

38:27.479 --> 38:29.132
[clears throat]

38:29.176 --> 38:30.830
Hey.

38:30.873 --> 38:32.919
I just wanted to
come by and apologize

38:32.962 --> 38:33.963
about the other night.

38:34.007 --> 38:35.748
[chuckles]

38:35.791 --> 38:38.359
You have nothing
to apologize for.

38:38.403 --> 38:40.535
I absolutely, completely
blame Maze.

38:40.579 --> 38:42.232
That girl is a freak.

38:42.276 --> 38:44.147
[laughing]:
She is odd.

38:44.191 --> 38:47.455
But she also made me realize
some things about myself.

38:47.499 --> 38:51.372
Maze isn't
the only odd one.

38:51.416 --> 38:53.505
I'm a mess.

38:53.548 --> 38:57.204
All that talk about
feeling normal again?

38:57.247 --> 38:58.945
Wishful thinking.

38:58.988 --> 39:01.382
I have a long road ahead.

39:03.428 --> 39:06.387
You know, whatever
this is that we have,

39:06.431 --> 39:08.346
it has never been normal.

39:09.695 --> 39:13.612
And I decided that
I just have to own that.

39:15.440 --> 39:17.877
I like you, Charlotte.

39:17.920 --> 39:21.663
You are unlike anyone
I have ever met.

39:21.707 --> 39:25.188
So if you need time
to sort some things out,

39:25.232 --> 39:27.452
I can wait.

39:29.889 --> 39:30.629
You're worth it.

39:30.672 --> 39:32.587
[chuckles softly]

39:34.546 --> 39:37.592
So, I heard
the divorce went through.

39:37.636 --> 39:39.420
What are you gonna do
with your half of Lux?

39:39.464 --> 39:41.379
Very funny, Decker.
[chuckles]

39:41.422 --> 39:42.945
What's up?

39:42.989 --> 39:44.556
Some of us from the precinct
are going down to the Paddock

39:44.599 --> 39:45.861
for beers after work,

39:45.905 --> 39:47.080
and I thought
you might want to join,

39:47.123 --> 39:48.516
if you don't have
anything better to do.

39:48.560 --> 39:50.388
I don't think I should.

39:50.431 --> 39:52.172
Oh, yeah, no big deal.

39:52.215 --> 39:55.218
Just, like I said,
a lot of people are going, so...

39:55.262 --> 39:56.394
Listen, Chloe,

39:56.437 --> 39:58.961
you and I, it's not a good idea.

39:59.005 --> 40:03.401
Oh, I wasn't suggesting
anything romantic at all.

40:03.444 --> 40:04.880
I just...Listen, it's just

40:04.924 --> 40:07.230
we deal with death
every day,

40:07.274 --> 40:09.537
and...

40:09.581 --> 40:11.104
everybody's gonna die.

40:11.147 --> 40:13.019
Someday you'll die,
and I just...

40:13.062 --> 40:14.629
Yeah.

40:14.673 --> 40:17.197
Losing your brother,
it's still

40:17.240 --> 40:18.546
really affecting you, huh?

40:18.590 --> 40:22.681
Understatement
of the millennia.

40:22.724 --> 40:25.771
I understand.
I do.

40:25.814 --> 40:28.904
And about tonight,
it's not a big deal.

40:30.950 --> 40:32.125
But...

40:32.168 --> 40:38.261
just so I know
that I'm not crazy, um...

40:38.305 --> 40:39.437
in the surveillance van,

40:39.480 --> 40:42.352
when I asked you
to stay in L.A.,

40:42.396 --> 40:45.530
we did have a moment
there, yeah?

40:47.140 --> 40:48.489
We did share a moment.

40:48.533 --> 40:50.448
Which is why I had
to tell you

40:50.491 --> 40:54.016
that I'm not
relationship material.

40:54.060 --> 40:55.801
Mm.

40:57.803 --> 41:00.632
Well, for what it's worth,

41:00.675 --> 41:01.937
it was a really nice moment.

far away from you tonight.

41:21.522 --> 41:23.481
Oh, it is good.

41:23.524 --> 41:25.874
I've finally got
you figured out.

41:25.918 --> 41:28.181
[chuckles]
Really?
Mm, yes.

41:28.224 --> 41:30.618
You're terrified of letting
someone get close to you

41:30.662 --> 41:33.273
'cause you know they'll
eventually leave you.

41:33.316 --> 41:35.275
You'll outlive them.

41:35.318 --> 41:37.103
You want to die because

you don't want to

Yeah, well, duh.

...then we have got

41:47.635 --> 41:49.550
Is that right?

41:49.594 --> 41:51.073
Mm.

41:51.117 --> 41:52.727
You see, I don't think you've
been spending time with me

41:52.771 --> 41:54.642
trying to figure out
how to kill me.

41:54.686 --> 41:56.078
I think you want
to spend time

41:56.122 --> 41:58.167
with someone who's been
screwed by your Dad

41:58.211 --> 41:59.647
as much as you've been.

41:59.691 --> 42:03.042
Youare the one that
doesn't want to be alone.

42:05.131 --> 42:07.960
I suppose one might
call us friends now.

42:08.003 --> 42:11.267
And it is nice to have
a friend who can relate.

42:11.311 --> 42:12.617
I get you.

42:12.660 --> 42:15.010
No, you don't.

42:15.054 --> 42:17.317
But you've been
on the earth, what, five years?

42:17.360 --> 42:20.015
You'll see.

42:20.059 --> 42:22.322
It's hard not
to get attached.

42:22.365 --> 42:25.020
Okay. Okay.

42:25.064 --> 42:26.979
So we both have some issues
that we need to work through.

42:27.022 --> 42:29.764
But if we're gonna
get revenge on Dad,

42:29.808 --> 42:31.766
we've got to be committed.

42:31.810 --> 42:33.638
I've already married you.

42:33.681 --> 42:36.118
I'm not sure how much
more committed I could be.

42:36.162 --> 42:38.077
[laughing]

42:39.382 --> 42:41.036
True. True.

42:41.080 --> 42:42.777
