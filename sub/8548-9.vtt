WEBVTT

00:09.810 --> 00:13.013
WHAT'S ALL THE NOISE?

00:13.081 --> 00:16.384
NOISE? THIS HAPPENS
TO BE 60'S MUSIC.

00:16.450 --> 00:18.919
THE GREATEST DANCE MUSIC
OF ALL TIME.

00:18.986 --> 00:22.290
WE HAD THE PONY.

00:22.356 --> 00:25.126
WE HAD THE MASH POTATOES.

00:25.193 --> 00:28.162
AND THE GRAND DADDY
OF THEM ALL, THE TWIST.

00:30.831 --> 00:34.535
THAT WAS INVENTED
BY THAT GUY, CHUBBY DOMINO.

00:36.204 --> 00:37.671
CHUBBY CHECKER.

00:37.738 --> 00:40.508
WATCH. I'LL SHOW YOU.
IT'S ALL IN THE HIPS.

00:42.776 --> 00:45.346
SEE, IT'S LIKE DRYING YOURSELF
WITH THE TOWEL.

00:45.413 --> 00:48.082
COME ON. JUST DO EVERYTHING
THAT I DO.

00:50.884 --> 00:52.453
THIS IS FUN.

00:52.520 --> 00:55.089
NOW, WATCH
THIS TRICKY MOVE.

00:55.156 --> 00:57.225
OH! OH!

00:57.291 --> 00:59.059
OH!
OH! OH! OH!

00:59.127 --> 01:00.528
OH, NO, NO.

01:00.594 --> 01:02.596
OH, NO, NO.
OH, NO, NO.

01:03.497 --> 01:05.599
HARRIETTE!
HARRIETTE!

01:17.445 --> 01:19.413
* IT'S A RARE CONDITION *

01:19.480 --> 01:21.282
* IN THIS DAY AND AGE *

01:21.349 --> 01:24.585
* TO READ ANY GOOD NEWS
ON THE NEWSPAPER PAGE *

01:24.652 --> 01:27.855
* LOVE AND TRADITION
OF THE GRAND DESIGN *

01:27.921 --> 01:32.493
* SOME PEOPLE SAY IS
EVEN HARDER TO FIND *

01:32.560 --> 01:35.629
* WELL, THEN, THERE MUST
BE SOME MAGIC CLUE *

01:35.696 --> 01:39.967
* INSIDE THESE
GENTLE WALLS *

01:40.033 --> 01:41.735
* 'CAUSE ALL I SEE *

01:41.802 --> 01:43.537
* IS A TOWER OF DREAMS *

01:43.604 --> 01:46.774
* REAL LOVE BURSTING
OUT OF EVERY SEAM *

01:48.309 --> 01:51.412
* AS DAYS GO BY *

01:51.479 --> 01:55.383
* WE'RE GONNA FILL OUR HOUSE
WITH HAPPINESS *

01:55.449 --> 01:58.051
* THE MOON MAY CRY *

01:58.118 --> 02:02.089
* WE'RE GONNA SMOTHER THE BLUES
WITH TENDERNESS *

02:02.156 --> 02:05.426
* AS DAYS GO BY *

02:05.493 --> 02:09.096
* THERE'S ROOM FOR YOU,
ROOM FOR ME *

02:09.163 --> 02:13.133
* FOR GENTLE HEARTS
AN OPPORTUNITY *

02:13.201 --> 02:16.437
* AS DAYS GO BY *

02:16.504 --> 02:20.641
* IT'S THE BIGGER LOVE
OF THE FAMILY *

02:32.420 --> 02:35.055
YOU ARE NOT GOING
TO BELIEVE WHAT
HAPPENED TODAY.

02:35.122 --> 02:38.426
I STILL DON'T BELIEVE IT.
IT'S JUST UNBELIEVABLE.

02:38.492 --> 02:42.830
WELL, TELL US, AND WE
WON'T BELIEVE IT, EITHER.

02:42.896 --> 02:44.465
BERT IS GONE.

02:44.532 --> 02:46.133
THE BEST PARTNER
I EVER HAD

02:46.200 --> 02:48.101
JUST UP AND QUIT
THE FORCE.

02:48.168 --> 02:49.136
WHY?

02:49.203 --> 02:51.272
HE WANTED TO PURSUE
HIS DREAM.

02:51.339 --> 02:53.407
HE'S OPENING UP
A DOUGHNUT SHOP?

02:55.376 --> 02:56.744
NO. HE MOVED
TO HOLLYWOOD

02:56.810 --> 03:00.180
TO WRITE THAT SCREENPLAY
HE ALWAYS TALKED ABOUT.

03:00.248 --> 03:02.250
SOUNDS LIKE BERT.

03:02.316 --> 03:03.984
HEY, I'M HAPPY
FOR HIM.

03:04.051 --> 03:06.220
BUT MEANWHILE,
WHILE HE'S OUT
IN SUNNY CALIFORNIA,

03:06.287 --> 03:07.521
BREAKING INTO
SHOW BUSINESS,

03:07.588 --> 03:10.358
I'M STUCK HERE,
BREAKING IN
A NEW PARTNER.

03:10.424 --> 03:13.427
YOU'LL LIKE YOUR PARTNER
ONCE YOU GET TO KNOW HIM.

03:13.494 --> 03:16.797
THAT'S THE PROBLEM.
IT'S NOT A HIM,
IT'S A HER.

03:16.864 --> 03:18.432
CARL,
THAT'S TERRIFIC.

03:18.499 --> 03:21.702
A POLICEWOMAN?
JUST LIKE MOM WAS.

03:21.769 --> 03:23.237
THAT'S COOL, DAD.

03:23.304 --> 03:25.172
WELL, IT SOUNDS
GREAT IN THEORY,

03:25.239 --> 03:27.475
BUT WHEN MY LIFE
IS ON THE LINE,

03:27.541 --> 03:31.679
I WANT A MAN TO BACK ME UP,
NOT SOME WOMAN
I'D HAVE TO PROTECT.

03:31.745 --> 03:35.249
YEAH. NEXT THING YOU KNOW,
THEY'LL WANT
TO PLAY FOOTBALL.

03:43.056 --> 03:44.625
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
A WOMAN COP

03:44.692 --> 03:47.861
CAN'T PROTECT
HERSELF OR YOU?

03:47.928 --> 03:50.097
WELL, THEY'RE
A LOT SMALLER,
FOR ONE THING,

03:50.163 --> 03:51.765
THEY CAN'T RUN
AS FAST,

03:51.832 --> 03:54.835
AND THEY LACK
UPPER BODY STRENGTH.

04:01.709 --> 04:04.445
WELL, I LOOSENED IT
FOR YOU.

04:04.512 --> 04:05.679
I DON'T BELIEVE IT.

04:05.746 --> 04:08.549
MY OWN FATHER
IS A CHAUVINIST.

04:08.616 --> 04:11.885
CHAUVINIST?
I THOUGHT WE
WERE BAPTIST.

04:24.665 --> 04:27.601
RACHEL, CAN YOU GET ME
THE FURNITURE POLISH?

04:27.668 --> 04:31.472
SURE. JUST AS SOON AS
I FINISH THIS CHAPTER.

04:31.539 --> 04:34.207
LOVE'S BURNING FURY.

04:34.274 --> 04:38.446
RACHEL, NOT ANOTHER
TRASHY ROMANCE NOVEL.

04:38.512 --> 04:40.180
HONEY, WHEN YOU
AIN'T GOT IT,

04:40.247 --> 04:43.183
YOU READ ABOUT IT.

04:43.250 --> 04:46.019
CAN I BORROW IT
WHEN YOU'RE THROUGH?

04:48.322 --> 04:49.757
GOOD EVENING, LADIES.

04:49.823 --> 04:51.359
HOW YOU DOING?

04:51.425 --> 04:52.860
HOW'S YOUR
NEW PARTNER?

04:52.926 --> 04:54.828
NOT BAD.
NOT BAD AT ALL

04:54.895 --> 04:57.498
OUR FIRST CALL WAS
A LIQUOR STORE HOLDUP.

04:57.565 --> 05:00.033
VANESSA TACKLES THE GUY
AND HOLDS HIM DOWN.

05:00.100 --> 05:03.371
SO WOMEN COPS ARE OKAY, HUH?

05:03.437 --> 05:04.438
I HAVE TO ADMIT,

05:04.505 --> 05:06.607
SHE'S GOING
TO WORK OUT FINE.

05:06.674 --> 05:08.108
WHERE'S
MY BOWLING SHIRT?

05:08.175 --> 05:09.710
IN THE LAUNDRY ROOM.

05:09.777 --> 05:11.812
NOT ONLY IS VANESSA
A GOOD COP,

05:11.879 --> 05:14.982
BUT SHE'S
A WEIGHT LIFTER,
AND SHE BOWLS.

05:15.048 --> 05:16.684
JUST LIKE ONE OF THE GUYS.

05:16.750 --> 05:18.852
SHE'S TAKING
BERT'S PLACE ON
THE BOWLING TEAM.

05:18.919 --> 05:21.822
SHE'LL BE IN
TO PICK ME UP IN A FEW MINUTES.

05:21.889 --> 05:24.692
BOY, CARL SURE HAS CHANGED
HIS MIND ABOUT VANESSA.

05:24.758 --> 05:29.029
YEAH. SHE SOUNDS
LIKE ROBOCOP.

05:29.096 --> 05:30.898
[DOOR BELL]

05:34.635 --> 05:38.071
HI. I'M VANESSA GREER,
CARL'S NEW PARTNER.

05:41.542 --> 05:43.544
THIS IS THE WINSLOW
HOUSE, ISN'T IT?

05:43.611 --> 05:46.179
YES. COME ON IN.
I'M HARRIETTE.

05:46.246 --> 05:47.815
OH, OF COURSE,
HAPPY TO MEET YOU.

05:47.881 --> 05:50.083
CARL TALKED ABOUT YOU
ALL DAY.

05:50.150 --> 05:53.687
OH. THIS IS MY SISTER
RACHEL AND CARL'S
MOTHER.

05:53.754 --> 05:54.788
WOW.

05:55.823 --> 05:57.391
AH, VANESSA!
RIGHT ON TIME.

05:57.458 --> 06:00.360
I LOVE A PROMPT PARTNER.
DID YOU MEET EVERYBODY?

06:00.428 --> 06:02.262
OH, YEAH. WE MET.

06:02.329 --> 06:03.431
WELL, LET'S GO.

06:03.497 --> 06:05.799
YEAH, BECAUSE I'M
FEELING HOT TONIGHT.

06:05.866 --> 06:07.535
YEAH. ME, TOO.

06:07.601 --> 06:10.638
WHOO, WHOO,
WHOO, WHOO! WHOO, WHOO!
STRIKE FORCE! STRIKE FORCE!

06:10.704 --> 06:13.741
HOPE TO SEE YOU ALL AGAIN SOON.

06:17.711 --> 06:19.179
WELL...
SHE SEEMS VERY NICE.

06:19.246 --> 06:21.749
UH-HUH.

06:21.815 --> 06:25.385
I MEAN IT'S GOOD TO SEE
CARL AND SHE GETTING
ALONG SO WELL.

06:25.453 --> 06:28.388
UH-HUH.

06:28.456 --> 06:30.591
THAT WOMAN
IS GORGEOUS.

06:30.658 --> 06:33.761
PLENTY OF
UPPER BODY STRENGTH.

06:35.228 --> 06:38.131
REALLY?
I DIDN'T NOTICE.

06:40.901 --> 06:42.803
UH-HUH.

06:53.481 --> 06:55.182
GREAT BREAKFAST,
MOM.

06:55.248 --> 06:56.684
THANKS, SWEETIE.

06:56.750 --> 06:58.652
SEE YA AFTER
MY PIANO LESSON.

06:58.719 --> 07:01.388
HEY, IT'S YOUR TURN
TO CLEAN UP.

07:01.455 --> 07:03.524
I CLEANED UP LAST TIME.

07:03.591 --> 07:05.459
NO, YOU DIDN'T.

07:05.526 --> 07:07.595
OKAY. I'LL FLIP IT
FOR YOU.

07:07.661 --> 07:10.498
HEADS, YOU CLEAN UP,
TAILS, I DON'T.

07:12.900 --> 07:15.368
WAIT A MINUTE.

07:15.435 --> 07:17.771
OKAY.

07:20.508 --> 07:23.477
HEADS. YOU CLEAN UP.
SEE YA.

07:27.648 --> 07:31.952
MAN, I ALWAYS LOSE
THE COIN TOSS.

07:35.155 --> 07:38.025
WHAT A BEAUTIFUL DAY!

07:41.529 --> 07:42.696
MORNING, BABY.

07:42.763 --> 07:45.065
I FIXED YOUR FAVORITE,
BLUEBERRY PANCAKES.

07:45.132 --> 07:48.101
OH, THANK YOU, HONEY,
BUT I'M TRYING
TO CUT DOWN.

07:48.168 --> 07:51.371
I'LL JUST HAVE LITTLE COFFEE--
NO CREAM, NO SUGAR.

07:51.438 --> 07:54.474
WHAT YOU ALL
SPIFFED UP FOR?

07:54.542 --> 07:56.877
NOTHING, MAMA.
JUST A ROUTINE STAKEOUT.

07:56.944 --> 08:00.180
SITTING IN A CAR FOR 12 HOURS
DRINKING COLD COFFEE.

08:02.215 --> 08:04.384
WHEN YOU USED TO GO ON
STAKEOUTS WITH BERT,

08:04.451 --> 08:09.356
YOU ALWAYS WORE YOUR
GUMBY T-SHIRT
AND OLD BLUE JEANS.

08:09.422 --> 08:11.859
WELL, VANESSA HAS MADE ME
REALIZE

08:11.925 --> 08:14.762
A POLICE OFFICER SHOULD
ALWAYS LOOK HIS OR HER BEST.

08:14.828 --> 08:19.432
OH, I'M SURE VANESSA
ALWAYS LOOKS HER
OR HIS BEST.

08:19.499 --> 08:21.802
YEAH, AND SHE'S SUCH
GOOD COMPANY, TOO.

08:21.869 --> 08:24.271
WE HAVE SO MUCH
IN COMMON.

08:24.337 --> 08:25.839
LIKE WHAT?

08:25.906 --> 08:30.544
WELL, WE'RE BOTH
INTO PHYSICAL FITNESS.

08:30.611 --> 08:32.179
DO THE OTHER COPS
LIKE HER, TOO?

08:32.245 --> 08:34.715
THEY LOVE HER.
SHE'S AN ASSET
TO THE FORCE.

08:34.782 --> 08:37.885
OH, WE NOTICED HER ASSETS
THE MINUTE SHE WALKED IN.

08:39.787 --> 08:42.690
NOW, RACHEL, THAT
WAS A SEXIST REMARK.

08:42.756 --> 08:45.225
NOW JUST BECAUSE A WOMAN
HAPPENS TO BE GOOD-LOOKING

08:45.292 --> 08:48.461
DOESN'T MEAN THAT SHE CAN'T
BE AN OUTSTANDING
POLICE OFFICER.

08:48.528 --> 08:51.298
SO, YOU NOTICE
SHE'S GOOD-LOOKING.

08:53.100 --> 08:54.935
BUT, MAMA,
I'M A POLICE OFFICER.

08:55.002 --> 08:58.538
WE'RE TRAINED
TO NOTICE EVERYTHING.

08:59.406 --> 09:00.874
QUIT IT YOU TWO.

09:00.941 --> 09:04.578
I'M HAPPY CARL HAS
A GOOD RELATIONSHIP
WITH HIS PARTNER.

09:04.645 --> 09:07.881
AW, THANK YOU, HONEY.

09:07.948 --> 09:10.684
VANESSA AND I ARE
JUST TWO COPS DOING OUR JOB.

09:10.751 --> 09:13.854
WHEN I LOOK AT HER,
ALL I SEE IS A UNIFORM.

09:13.921 --> 09:16.590
THE WAY I FEEL ABOUT VANESSA
IS STRICTLY PROFESSIONAL.

09:16.657 --> 09:19.159
DO THESE PINSTRIPES
MAKE ME LOOK THINNER?

09:23.296 --> 09:26.099
YEAH.
I CAN HARDLY SEE YOU.

09:28.101 --> 09:30.570
THANKS. BYE.

09:37.010 --> 09:38.111
WHAT?

09:38.178 --> 09:40.080
NOTHING. NOTHING.

09:40.147 --> 09:42.115
JUST BECAUSE CARL IS
GOING TO BE SPENDING

09:42.182 --> 09:44.084
ALL THAT TIME
IN A PARKED CAR

09:44.151 --> 09:46.553
WITH THAT
GORGEOUS YOUNGER WOMAN,

09:46.620 --> 09:49.522
NO REASON
FOR YOU TO WORRY.

09:49.589 --> 09:50.958
I'M NOT WORRIED.
OF COURSE, NOT.

09:51.024 --> 09:53.961
WHY SHOULD YOU BE?
FOR ANY NORMAL MAN,

09:54.027 --> 09:56.196
THIS WOULD BE
AN INCREDIBLE
TEMPTATION.

09:56.263 --> 09:59.332
FORTUNATELY, WE'RE
TALKING ABOUT CARL.

10:00.768 --> 10:02.936
THANK GOODNESS
THERE WERE NO COPS
LIKE VANESSA

10:03.003 --> 10:05.538
WHEN MY SAM
WAS ON THE FORCE.

10:05.605 --> 10:06.974
MOTHER WINSLOW.
HMM?

10:07.040 --> 10:07.941
I TRUST CARL.

10:08.008 --> 10:11.078
SURE YOU DO, SUGAR.
I TRUSTED MY SAM.

10:11.144 --> 10:14.047
HE WAS A GOOD MAN.
CARL'S A GOOD MAN.

10:14.114 --> 10:17.718
BUT WE DON'T
KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT VANESSA.

10:18.986 --> 10:22.622
SHE MAY BE
A SEX-CRAZED VIXEN.

10:27.895 --> 10:30.297
[PAULA ABDUL VIDEO
PLAYS ON TELEVISION]

10:34.902 --> 10:37.370
[TELEVISION GOES OFF]

10:45.312 --> 10:48.916
WHY IS EDDIE STARING
AT THE TV? IT'S OFF.

10:48.982 --> 10:52.152
I TURNED IT OFF
FOR HIS OWN GOOD.

10:53.754 --> 10:56.489
HE WAS WATCHING ANOTHER
PAULA ABDUL VIDEO.

10:56.556 --> 11:00.994
YEAH. THAT GIRL
CAN REALLY MOVE.

11:01.061 --> 11:03.530
I REMEMBER WHEN
I COULD MOVE LIKE HER.

11:03.596 --> 11:06.299
NOW I JUST READ.

11:09.102 --> 11:11.204
EDDIE?

11:12.039 --> 11:13.606
I GIVE HIM
ONE MORE MINUTE,

11:13.673 --> 11:16.676
THEN I'M HOSING HIM DOWN.

11:19.312 --> 11:23.984
OOH. I DIDN'T KNOW
RACHEL HAD SUCH
EXOTIC TASTES.

11:24.051 --> 11:27.054
SHE DOESN'T.
THAT'S MINE.

11:30.423 --> 11:33.660
SO, CARL
NOT HOME YET?

11:33.727 --> 11:35.595
HE'S STILL
ON THAT STAKEOUT.

11:35.662 --> 11:38.465
OUT ALL NIGHT,
FIVE NIGHTS IN A ROW?

11:38.531 --> 11:40.500
FOUR NIGHTS,
AND HE'S WORKING.

11:40.567 --> 11:41.935
OF COURSE HE IS.

11:42.002 --> 11:43.971
DON'T WORRY
ABOUT A THING.

11:44.037 --> 11:47.407
CARL DOESN'T NEED TO
GO OUT LOOKING FOR LOVE.

11:47.474 --> 11:50.343
HE GETS PLENTY AT HOME.

11:50.410 --> 11:54.214
HARRIETTE,
WE ALL KNOW HOW MUCH
CARL LOVES YOU,

11:54.281 --> 11:56.183
BUT PUTTING ANY MAN
NEXT TO VANESSA

11:56.249 --> 11:58.685
IS LIKE PUTTING A KID
IN A CANDY SHOP.

11:58.752 --> 12:01.889
AND WE KNOW HOW MUCH
CARL LOVES CANDY.

12:03.023 --> 12:05.358
OKAY. THAT'S IT.
ENOUGH IS ENOUGH.

12:05.425 --> 12:07.928
I TRUST CARL.
HE'S OUT WORKING,

12:07.995 --> 12:11.799
NOT OUT WITH SOME BIMBO
IN A SLEAZY MOTEL.

12:14.902 --> 12:17.404
LOOKS LIKE A KEY.

12:19.907 --> 12:23.076
LOOKS
LIKE A MOTEL KEY.

12:24.044 --> 12:28.415
"ROOM 3,
LOUIE'S LOVE GROTTO."

12:29.582 --> 12:32.052
UH-HUH.

12:38.591 --> 12:41.194
LOUIE'S LOVE GROTTO?

12:41.261 --> 12:42.796
THERE'S SOME
REASONABLE EXPLANATION

12:42.863 --> 12:44.131
FOR CARL
HAVING THIS KEY.

12:44.197 --> 12:47.935
SURE THERE IS.
MAYBE THEY'RE
NOT HIS PANTS.

12:48.001 --> 12:50.804
THERE'S A TWINKIE
IN THE POCKET.

12:50.871 --> 12:53.941
SO MUCH
FOR THAT THEORY.

12:54.007 --> 12:56.176
