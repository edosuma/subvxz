01:06.056 --> 01:10.288
He says, "Christmas."
So I say to him...

01:10.361 --> 01:12.955
Should we go shopping?

01:14.131 --> 01:15.723
The kid's 16.

01:17.701 --> 01:20.829
He says,
"But, Uncle, it's Christmas."

01:22.439 --> 01:24.771
How much you taking off?

01:24.842 --> 01:26.867
Uncle Azim...

01:26.944 --> 01:30.607
This is him.
The kid I am talking about.

01:30.681 --> 01:32.672
He looks okay to me.

01:34.251 --> 01:36.742
Ekrem, how you doing?

01:41.091 --> 01:43.218
He looks okay, yeah,

01:43.727 --> 01:46.958
but he won't do
one lousy thing for me.

01:48.065 --> 01:50.431
Here. Look, Ekrem.

01:51.702 --> 01:53.067
Take this.

01:53.170 --> 01:54.432
Azim, please.

01:55.139 --> 02:00.076
You see? We had a deal.
Now he's backing out.

02:00.144 --> 02:02.237
Azim, leave the kid alone.

02:04.448 --> 02:07.713
It's obviously
some psychological thing.

02:08.352 --> 02:12.789
Take the fucking <i>ustura</i>
and finish this <i>Rus!</i>

02:53.030 --> 02:55.760
Please, I need help.

02:56.633 --> 02:58.624
Do you need methadone?

02:58.702 --> 03:01.535
For methadone,
I need to see prescription.

03:14.818 --> 03:16.080
Was she hemorrhaging
when you found her?

03:16.153 --> 03:17.245
Yes.

03:22.359 --> 03:24.327
Did you get a name?
No.

03:25.562 --> 03:28.395
You're all right, sweetheart.
Stay with us, all right?

03:29.233 --> 03:33.033
Baby's in distress.
Her stats are very poor.

03:41.512 --> 03:46.449
Fetal heart rate's
at 60, 58, 57
and free falling.

03:46.784 --> 03:47.876
Speak to me.

03:47.951 --> 03:50.545
Placental abruption.
We need to get
the baby out now.

04:06.703 --> 04:09.797
I'm afraid
we've lost the mother.
Okay, enough.

04:12.342 --> 04:13.331
Call it.

04:13.410 --> 04:17.709
Unidentified woman died
December the 20th, 23:13.

04:19.382 --> 04:23.786
Baby girl born
20th of December, 23:14.

04:57.855 --> 04:59.345
Did you sleep?

05:00.157 --> 05:01.317
A bit.

05:03.927 --> 05:05.121
Mum...

05:07.331 --> 05:08.821
Are you okay?

05:10.767 --> 05:13.031
Of course not.
It's Christmas.

05:21.445 --> 05:24.710
Anna, where did you get this?

05:26.583 --> 05:29.609
It's your own fault
for giving him
something to play with.

05:29.686 --> 05:32.120
Well, I can't read Russian,
can I?

05:35.025 --> 05:37.357
I told you, Uncle Stepan.

05:37.427 --> 05:41.090
I found it in
the handbag of the girl
who died in my ward.

05:41.165 --> 05:44.259
Do you always rob
the bodies of the dead?

05:44.334 --> 05:46.598
Yes, actually.
We all do it.

05:46.670 --> 05:49.867
It's one of the perks
of working at the hospital.

05:51.642 --> 05:55.408
Did you know
that your daughter robs
the bodies of the dead?

05:59.082 --> 06:01.175
I'm looking
for an address.

06:03.220 --> 06:08.123
You have an uncle, Anna, who doesn't
steal the things from the dead.

06:08.559 --> 06:10.083
Not even their secrets.

06:10.160 --> 06:14.221
Don't go all momentous on us, Stepan.
Lift your elbows.

06:18.635 --> 06:21.160
You should put this
into her coffin.

06:21.939 --> 06:24.339
Bury her secrets
with her bodies.

06:25.242 --> 06:26.334
Body.

06:28.011 --> 06:29.273
Singular.

06:41.225 --> 06:44.194
<i>My name is Tatiana.</i>

06:44.261 --> 06:47.719
<i>My father died in the mines</i>
<i>in my village,</i>

06:47.798 --> 06:49.766
<i>so he was already buried</i>
<i>when he died.</i>

06:51.435 --> 06:53.198
<i>We were all buried there.</i>

06:53.270 --> 06:56.967
<i>Buried under the soil</i>
<i>of Russia.</i>

06:57.040 --> 07:00.999
<i>That is why I left,</i>
<i>to find a better life.</i>

07:12.756 --> 07:15.247
So...

07:15.325 --> 07:16.952
You go pick up Azim
and you bring him back here

07:17.027 --> 07:18.494
with his bitch of a wife.

07:18.562 --> 07:19.893
<i>Da, da.</i> Okay.

07:19.963 --> 07:23.160
Then I'll think of an excuse
and we can get away.

07:32.376 --> 07:34.207
Who the fuck's that?

07:36.546 --> 07:40.505
Maybe somebody sent your dad
a hooker for Christmas.

07:40.617 --> 07:43.848
Man, you're so fucking
unbelievably disrespectful.

07:51.461 --> 07:53.429
Hey, you got work to do.

07:54.064 --> 07:55.088
Move!

07:56.233 --> 07:57.325
See you.

08:25.162 --> 08:27.687
Oh, no. We are closed.
Yes, I know.

08:30.467 --> 08:31.957
I'm a midwife.

08:32.635 --> 08:35.969
Then unless one of my daughters
is keeping something from me,

08:36.039 --> 08:37.734
you have the wrong address.

08:37.808 --> 08:40.402
I was hoping to speak
to the manager.

08:41.078 --> 08:42.375
Khitrova?

08:43.113 --> 08:44.978
My dad was Russian.

08:45.048 --> 08:47.949
What was your father's first name?
Ivan.

08:48.018 --> 08:50.612
IvÃ¡n? So you are
Anna Ivanovna.

08:52.389 --> 08:53.481
Now come.

08:58.061 --> 08:59.858
Hurry, hurry, hurry!

08:59.930 --> 09:03.866
I must stir, I must stir, or
the borscht dies in my hands.

09:03.934 --> 09:07.301
Today, it is family.
Here is my son, Kirill.

09:07.371 --> 09:09.805
Hurry, hurry, hurry,
hurry, hurry!

09:12.609 --> 09:15.043
Come, come, come on.
Hurry! Hurry!

09:15.112 --> 09:17.444
More glasses for red
over there.

09:25.956 --> 09:27.355
My angels.

09:27.891 --> 09:31.292
My angels,
you must practice more.

09:32.596 --> 09:37.533
You know, you must... You must make
the wood cry. Show me.

10:13.670 --> 10:17.106
This is an old card,
from before the renovations.

10:18.241 --> 10:22.974
But if she had worked here,
I would remember her name.

10:24.114 --> 10:26.878
Perhaps she ate here once.

10:28.685 --> 10:30.084
Try it. Try.

10:31.154 --> 10:32.416
Try this.

10:37.027 --> 10:38.961
My God, that's amazing.

10:39.696 --> 10:41.789
My dad made borscht
just like that.

11:01.485 --> 11:06.149
Anna, I'm so sorry I couldn't help.
It is sad.

11:06.223 --> 11:08.088
Very sad.
It's all right.

11:08.158 --> 11:11.889
I'll probably find out more once I get
her diary translated.

11:16.867 --> 11:18.198
Her diary?

11:19.102 --> 11:21.229
Yeah. I found it in her bag.

11:22.806 --> 11:24.865
Okay, Anna,
this is how it will be.

11:24.941 --> 11:28.638
You will bring the diary and
I will translate it for you.

11:28.712 --> 11:31.510
And if we get the names
of any relatives,

11:33.550 --> 11:35.518
I will call them myself.

11:37.521 --> 11:39.955
I can just get my uncle to translate...
And when you come,

11:40.023 --> 11:42.787
I will make you
some more borscht.

11:43.994 --> 11:48.954
Like your papa used to make.
So tomorrow? Shall we say 7:00?

11:52.435 --> 11:56.166
Well, then it's settled.
But, for now, you must forgive me.

11:59.609 --> 12:01.406
Goodbye, Anna.

12:04.481 --> 12:05.709
Anna.

12:06.783 --> 12:09.616
You always work
at Trafalgar Hospital?

12:10.787 --> 12:12.186
Yes. Always.

12:13.657 --> 12:15.318
Yeah. That's good.

12:37.380 --> 12:38.711
Nice bike.

12:42.986 --> 12:45.386
Ural.

12:45.455 --> 12:47.582
You don't see them anymore.

12:48.858 --> 12:50.450
It was my dad's.

12:51.528 --> 12:53.655
How much do you want for it?

12:55.532 --> 12:57.523
It has sentimental value.

12:59.636 --> 13:02.935
"Sentimental value."
I've heard of that.

13:07.577 --> 13:09.943
Not staying for party?
No.

13:10.013 --> 13:11.207
Nor me.

13:12.549 --> 13:14.779
Chauffeurs don't get invited.

13:15.885 --> 13:18.376
You want to go
for a drink instead?

13:30.467 --> 13:37.031
Anna, how is it that your boyfriend
wasn't here to carve?

13:39.643 --> 13:43.135
I don't live with Oliver anymore,
Uncle Stepan.

13:43.213 --> 13:45.204
I'm living back here
for a bit.

13:45.281 --> 13:46.839
For as long as you want.

13:51.588 --> 13:53.783
I knew he would
run away from you.

13:53.857 --> 13:56.121
He didn't run away.

13:56.192 --> 13:59.389
Christ, you make me sound
like a burning building.

13:59.462 --> 14:01.020
Black men always run away.

14:01.097 --> 14:02.587
Oh, Stepan!

14:04.267 --> 14:06.235
I'm not allowed to be honest?

14:06.302 --> 14:07.462
He was a doctor, Stepan.

14:07.537 --> 14:10.335
What has that got
to do with anything?

14:15.278 --> 14:19.874
It is not natural
to mix race and race.

14:21.484 --> 14:24.112
That's why your baby
died inside you.

14:24.220 --> 14:27.212
Oh, shut up, Stepan!

14:27.290 --> 14:28.951
Anna, please...

14:29.025 --> 14:32.927
You're just how he was, stupid, bloody,
drunken Russians.

15:29.886 --> 15:31.046
Hello.

15:34.190 --> 15:36.886
Yeah. It's a panda.

15:42.565 --> 15:45.830
Coast is clear? Yeah? What?

15:45.902 --> 15:47.836
No, not "beach."

15:47.904 --> 15:50.134
I said "coast."

15:50.206 --> 15:52.834
It's an English expression,
you fucking baboon.

15:52.909 --> 15:56.845
It means...
It means, there are no police?

15:58.014 --> 16:00.107
You're sure? Good.

16:05.622 --> 16:08.056
No. My father
is not involved.

16:25.108 --> 16:27.372
The driver stays down here.

16:27.477 --> 16:28.739
Calm down.

16:28.945 --> 16:30.970
Do you really think
I do this kind of thing?

16:32.248 --> 16:35.877
He is not a driver.
He is the undertaker.

16:35.952 --> 16:37.544
Yeah?
Yeah.

16:37.620 --> 16:39.281
I don't like him.

16:43.326 --> 16:48.229
I have converted the upstairs rooms
into a private social club.

16:48.364 --> 16:51.663
Some gambling, some drinking,

16:51.734 --> 16:54.601
smoking, food, dancing.

16:55.605 --> 16:58.005
It has been
the most surprising...

16:59.709 --> 17:01.267
Hey.

17:01.344 --> 17:02.333
Hey, Ekrem.

17:03.479 --> 17:05.674
Be calm.

17:05.748 --> 17:07.545
Slowly.

17:07.617 --> 17:10.244
I got tickets, Azim.

17:10.319 --> 17:11.946
It's with Chelsea.

17:12.021 --> 17:13.488
They said there was
no tickets.

17:13.556 --> 17:15.922
But I got tickets
for the Chelsea game.

17:15.992 --> 17:20.520
Okay. Okay, okay.
You go watch DVD now.

17:22.898 --> 17:25.424
Come on.

17:28.238 --> 17:30.138
Azim?
Yeah?

17:30.206 --> 17:33.004
He knows to say
he hasn't seen us, right?

17:34.277 --> 17:36.802
He don't know anything.

17:36.880 --> 17:39.246
He's been touched
by the angels.

17:45.555 --> 17:48.353
Yeah. It's him.

17:48.424 --> 17:51.257
He was like a brother
to me.

17:51.327 --> 17:56.230
And now, he looks like
a fucking ice cream.

17:57.967 --> 18:02.495
Hey! Show some respect
for a dead man.

18:06.809 --> 18:08.037
Respect?

18:11.180 --> 18:13.842
This is respect.

18:19.956 --> 18:23.016
Okay, Kolya,
he's all yours.

18:24.060 --> 18:25.755
Show some respect.

18:27.463 --> 18:28.725
Pederast!

18:43.780 --> 18:45.748
Have you got hair dryer?

19:25.621 --> 19:28.112
Have you finished
cutting his hair?

19:33.696 --> 19:36.995
I thought you might want
Â£6.50 from his pocket.

19:43.573 --> 19:45.302
Better burn wallet.

19:47.243 --> 19:48.733
Okay.

19:48.811 --> 19:52.247
Now I'm going to do his teeth
and cut off his fingers.

19:54.317 --> 19:56.717
You might want to leave room.

20:03.693 --> 20:05.183
You too.

20:50.239 --> 20:51.263
Wait...

20:51.374 --> 20:54.104
Aren't we going to
weight him down or something?

20:54.177 --> 20:57.977
No. If you want to dump body,
this is best place.

20:58.448 --> 21:02.350
This is the best spot
to get rid of a corpse.

21:02.919 --> 21:04.045
Let's go.

21:05.154 --> 21:06.178
One...

21:07.090 --> 21:08.489
Two...

21:09.058 --> 21:10.252
Three...

21:13.963 --> 21:17.364
The current will keep it down
until past the barrier.

22:18.794 --> 22:20.989
<i>I am so excited this morning.</i>

22:21.564 --> 22:23.725
<i>Yesterday a friend came back</i>
<i>to our village</i>

22:23.799 --> 22:27.633
<i>and he told us all about the places</i>
<i>on the map that I look at,</i>

22:27.870 --> 22:32.830
<i>Paris, Amsterdam, London.</i>
<i>He's been there for real.</i>

22:34.143 --> 22:38.739
<i>He says the future of everything was</i>
<i>already happening at all those places.</i>

22:50.726 --> 22:51.954
Anna.

22:53.162 --> 22:55.653
I wasn't expecting you
so early.

22:55.731 --> 22:57.096
Is that okay?

22:59.302 --> 23:01.293
I copied the whole thing.

23:04.373 --> 23:06.273
Where is the original?

23:06.342 --> 23:07.934
Well, I was
going to keep it.

23:08.010 --> 23:11.502
Thought I might give it
to Tatiana's daughter
some day.

23:14.850 --> 23:18.115
I will need my spectacles
and a clear head.

23:18.187 --> 23:21.213
Today, I broke my rules
and I drank vodka.

23:22.959 --> 23:26.292
Tomorrow, I will translate it.

23:26.362 --> 23:30.025
And then I will bring
what I've done to your home.

23:31.167 --> 23:33.328
Where do you live, Anna?

23:33.402 --> 23:34.630
Not far.

23:36.372 --> 23:39.205
But I can just drop by
and pick it up.

23:39.275 --> 23:41.505
Or maybe I can drive you home.

23:42.545 --> 23:44.638
It's okay.
I've got my bike outside.

23:47.283 --> 23:49.444
Come on, Kirill.

23:49.652 --> 23:50.778
Get out.

23:53.189 --> 23:54.986
Okay. Okay.

23:56.125 --> 23:57.456
Get up, Kirill.

23:57.526 --> 23:59.323
We're partners now, man.

23:59.495 --> 24:00.484
Yeah, yeah.

24:00.596 --> 24:01.585
You know?

24:09.005 --> 24:10.302
Hello.

24:11.774 --> 24:13.366
Hello.
Sorry.

24:23.252 --> 24:25.152
Where's your fucking keys?

24:52.281 --> 24:54.579
We went to Kurdish place.

24:54.650 --> 24:57.210
They don't even
celebrate Christmas.

24:59.255 --> 25:01.655
Papa! What did I do?

25:01.724 --> 25:04.056
Is it Merry Christmas,
or what?

25:07.997 --> 25:10.022
I think he's had enough.

25:10.266 --> 25:13.099
Who the fuck are you
to tell me, "Enough"?

25:18.741 --> 25:20.800
Papa. Hey, Papa!

25:24.480 --> 25:25.606
Papa!

25:28.918 --> 25:29.942
Papa!

25:48.304 --> 25:49.498
Christ!

25:55.945 --> 25:57.879
You've got water in it.

25:59.982 --> 26:02.382
Water?
What makes you think that?

26:04.687 --> 26:05.779
Joke.

26:15.331 --> 26:19.825
Postmen used these in my village
when I was a boy.

26:19.902 --> 26:22.200
Russian copy. BMW flat-twin.

26:25.608 --> 26:26.700
Same.

26:28.444 --> 26:29.536
What?

26:38.687 --> 26:39.881
Please.

26:39.955 --> 26:41.354
Allow me.

26:56.906 --> 26:58.134
Get bus.

27:06.215 --> 27:07.944
You have far to go?

27:10.352 --> 27:12.183
Just across the park.

27:13.689 --> 27:16.123
I am driver.

27:16.192 --> 27:18.023
I even do limousines.

27:19.361 --> 27:20.623
Please.

27:20.696 --> 27:23.631
If Semyon, my boss, finds out I let
guest walk home in the rain,

27:23.699 --> 27:25.326
he will fire me.

27:32.675 --> 27:35.405
Have you ever met
a girl called Tatiana?

27:37.012 --> 27:40.277
I met a lot of girls
called Tatiana.

27:40.349 --> 27:42.010
She was pregnant.

27:44.019 --> 27:46.715
In that case, no,
I never heard of her.

27:50.459 --> 27:52.256
She died on my shift.

27:53.829 --> 27:55.797
I thought you did birth.

27:56.799 --> 27:59.461
Sometimes birth and death
go together.

28:01.670 --> 28:05.128
She came in with needle punctures
all over both arms.

28:05.207 --> 28:07.937
Probably a prostitute
at the age of 14.

28:11.580 --> 28:14.071
Do you think
Semyon's son knew her?

28:15.751 --> 28:17.946
I am driver.

28:18.020 --> 28:21.512
I go left, I go right,
I go straight ahead. That's it.

28:26.662 --> 28:28.755
You'll take the next right.

28:41.277 --> 28:43.142
How much do I owe you?

28:49.251 --> 28:50.912
Christmas present.

29:16.979 --> 29:17.968
Morning, sir.
Morning.

29:18.047 --> 29:19.480
How are you?

29:26.522 --> 29:29.116
We think he might
be Russian Mafia.

29:37.900 --> 29:40.494
And he was a member
of <i>vory v zakone.</i>

29:41.070 --> 29:44.631
Stars on his knees means he'd never
kneeled before anyone.

29:49.078 --> 29:54.015
In Russian prisons your life story
is written on your body

29:54.216 --> 29:55.615
in tattoos.

29:58.754 --> 30:01.484
You don't have tattoos,
you don't exist.

30:01.857 --> 30:03.791
This one was a captain.

30:05.260 --> 30:08.889
And he's been
professionally processed.

30:13.002 --> 30:14.993
There was something else.

30:20.342 --> 30:22.139
It was in his jacket.

30:31.420 --> 30:32.512
Anna?

30:33.122 --> 30:34.214
Yeah?

30:34.923 --> 30:36.584
Stepan, come here.

30:39.595 --> 30:41.620
Tell her
what you told me.

30:43.999 --> 30:46.900
What? Stepan, what?
I'm late for work.

30:50.172 --> 30:51.400
Who gave you that?

30:51.473 --> 30:52.997
It was on the dresser.

30:53.909 --> 30:56.878
Mum, you can't go through
my things.

30:56.945 --> 30:59.243
You wanted him to translate it.
Right and you didn't want to,

30:59.314 --> 31:01.282
so I found someone else.

31:01.850 --> 31:06.048
No, Anna. You don't go to
someone else with this.

31:07.556 --> 31:09.456
You don't go to anyone.

31:10.659 --> 31:12.957
<i>Nasilovaniye</i> means rape.

31:14.029 --> 31:16.589
<i>Igla</i> means needle.

31:18.200 --> 31:19.724
<i>Prostitutsiya...</i>

31:20.636 --> 31:24.003
Perhaps you can guess.
I'm going to wash my hands.

31:32.114 --> 31:34.139
Anna,

31:34.216 --> 31:37.083
Stepan said that this girl

31:37.152 --> 31:40.952
ended up in the hands
of the <i>vory v zakone.</i>

31:41.023 --> 31:43.150
Do you know what that means?

31:44.493 --> 31:45.983
Look,

31:46.061 --> 31:48.086
if I don't find a relative
in the next few days

31:48.163 --> 31:49.755
they're going to put Christine
out for fostering.

31:49.832 --> 31:53.324
Once she's in the system,
she'll never get out again.

31:55.204 --> 31:57.172
Who named her Christine?

31:58.407 --> 32:00.534
I had to call her something.

32:01.810 --> 32:03.675
Sounds like Christmas.

32:06.982 --> 32:08.711
She's so beautiful.

32:12.521 --> 32:17.390
If I can persuade Stepan to translate it,
will you leave the rest to the police?

32:24.333 --> 32:26.858
Tell him I've heard
bad words before.

33:16.351 --> 33:20.185
So which one are
we going to fuck?

33:20.255 --> 33:22.655
What do you care?

33:22.724 --> 33:23.952
Serious.

33:26.728 --> 33:30.562
Pick one. Come on.
Let me enjoy myself.

33:30.632 --> 33:34.693
Hear me.
You are going to fuck
one of these girls.

33:40.976 --> 33:42.466
Okay. Okay.

33:44.213 --> 33:47.148
You're going to fuck
one of these girls now!

33:49.585 --> 33:50.950
That's an order.

34:04.733 --> 34:06.291
What's the matter with you?

34:07.236 --> 34:09.136
Who are you going to fuck?

34:09.204 --> 34:10.603
Calm down, Kirill.

34:11.239 --> 34:12.672
I am recommending you
to my father.

34:12.741 --> 34:15.972
I have to be sure that you ain't
no fucking queer.

34:19.281 --> 34:21.612
That's enough, Kirill.

34:23.685 --> 34:24.708
Enough?

34:25.053 --> 34:26.350
Siberian ox...

34:26.621 --> 34:29.147
You don't tell a <i>vor</i>
what is enough.

34:32.594 --> 34:36.155
I'm taking you to
my father's favorite stable.

34:36.231 --> 34:39.688
He comes here himself
because they're all clean.

34:40.569 --> 34:44.130
So now I'm going to watch you fuck
one of these bitches.

34:44.873 --> 34:48.467
So you can prove me
that you are no queer.

34:51.580 --> 34:52.774
Psycho.

34:57.018 --> 34:58.953
So, which one is it
going to be?

35:03.525 --> 35:04.787
That one.

35:09.264 --> 35:13.928
<i>When I was little, London was like</i>
<i>a place in the Bible.</i>

35:14.002 --> 35:16.596
<i>I wasn't even sure</i>
<i>if it was real.</i>

35:16.672 --> 35:21.632
<i>My friend has told me there is a place</i>
<i>in London where they pay girls to sing.</i>

35:21.710 --> 35:25.942
<i>He said if I sang in this restaurant</i>
<i>I would make more money in a week</i>

35:26.014 --> 35:28.312
<i>than my father would</i>
<i>in a year.</i>

35:42.431 --> 35:43.762
Very nice.

35:46.234 --> 35:48.031
You did it very nice.

35:51.840 --> 35:53.865
Yeah? Really?

35:54.676 --> 35:56.735
Thank you, brother.

36:00.082 --> 36:03.916
So, if my examination is over,

36:05.721 --> 36:08.713
get the fuck out of here
while I get dressed.

36:56.171 --> 36:57.536
What's your last name?

37:01.176 --> 37:03.667
Tell me your last name.

37:05.414 --> 37:07.006
Kirilenko.

37:08.483 --> 37:09.541
Where are you from?

37:11.720 --> 37:12.812
Ukraine.

37:15.290 --> 37:18.157
Which village? Which town?

37:19.294 --> 37:21.387
Irpen.

37:21.463 --> 37:23.397
Outside Kiev.

37:34.376 --> 37:36.503
Stay alive a little longer.

37:42.684 --> 37:43.810
Understand?

37:56.064 --> 37:58.259
<i>My friend said</i>
<i>he would get me to Amsterdam</i>

37:58.333 --> 38:01.860
<i>and from there we could</i>
<i>find a way into London.</i>

38:01.970 --> 38:06.930
<i>I have been practicing my singing <i>
<i>and have even rejoined the church choir.</i></i></i>

38:07.442 --> 38:09.774
<i>I'm also practicing</i>
<i>my English.</i>

38:11.113 --> 38:15.482
<i>My friend says his uncle owns</i>
<i>a restaurant where you can sing.</i>

38:15.550 --> 38:18.212
<i>He's sure this man</i>
<i>will take care of me.</i>

38:18.286 --> 38:21.722
Let's go to sleep now.
Hello, Anna.

38:21.790 --> 38:24.122
I came on tiptoes.

38:24.192 --> 38:25.784
How did you get in here?

38:25.861 --> 38:30.127
There are always open doors,
Anna Ivanovna.

38:30.198 --> 38:32.928
I'm afraid you're not
allowed in here.

38:33.001 --> 38:36.266
Please, Anna.
Let me speak.

38:37.072 --> 38:38.972
I translated the diary.

38:46.748 --> 38:51.310
I was shocked to discover
that my son, Kirill,

38:51.386 --> 38:54.287
is mentioned many times.

38:56.525 --> 38:59.688
I have known for some years that
he has strayed from the path

38:59.761 --> 39:01.422
I set out for him.

39:08.503 --> 39:12.837
His mother... His mother died
when he was very young.

39:16.945 --> 39:18.970
What did it say about him?

39:20.682 --> 39:22.616
Many bad things.

39:26.922 --> 39:30.915
But please, Anna,
let me deal with him.

39:31.726 --> 39:34.889
If the diary should
find its way to the police...

39:36.131 --> 39:40.158
I mean, some of the things
my son did

39:42.237 --> 39:44.501
are illegal.

39:44.573 --> 39:46.768
And he is a good boy.

39:46.841 --> 39:49.867
I don't care about him.
I care about the baby.

39:51.313 --> 39:53.144
Of course. Of course.

40:01.690 --> 40:03.783
That is the baby.

40:05.227 --> 40:06.524
So sweet.

40:09.965 --> 40:12.593
I have made some enquiries.

40:12.667 --> 40:16.467
I have found out an address
for Tatiana's family in Russia.

40:17.505 --> 40:21.168
That's where
the baby belongs, no?

40:24.045 --> 40:27.105
Perhaps we can do a deal.

40:29.184 --> 40:30.981
Do you understand me?

40:35.824 --> 40:38.122
It's okay.
He was just leaving.

40:41.396 --> 40:43.956
So you know where I am,

40:45.033 --> 40:47.797
and I know where you are,
Anna Ivanovna.

40:50.839 --> 40:55.242
<i>I was thrown down the stairs,</i>
<i>and fell onto some sacks,</i>

40:55.310 --> 40:56.607
<i>like potato sacks.</i>

40:57.479 --> 40:59.913
<i>Kirill came down after me...</i>
"Kirill came down after me...

40:59.981 --> 41:01.710
<i>...and he hit me</i>
<i>until I was bleeding.</i>

41:01.783 --> 41:04.149
- "...and he hit me
until I was bleeding.

41:04.219 --> 41:08.883
"Then he tried to rape me
but he couldn't do it.

41:09.991 --> 41:13.859
"He just got madder and madder
and kept hitting me.

41:15.230 --> 41:18.631
"In the end
his father came down.

41:19.601 --> 41:23.059
"It was the father
who raped me.

41:26.207 --> 41:28.641
"He shouted at his son,

41:28.710 --> 41:33.613
"'If you don't break a horse
it will never be tame, Kirill."'

41:35.083 --> 41:37.711
Hello, dear.
How was your night?

41:42.157 --> 41:45.752
Stepan's arthritis is playing up.
I'm taking dictation.

41:53.168 --> 41:55.602
Do you want some tea
or something?

41:58.206 --> 41:59.867
He came to see me.

42:01.576 --> 42:04.067
The man from the restaurant,
he came to the hospital.

42:04.145 --> 42:07.603
I told you this! I told you that...
I know and it's my fault.

42:07.682 --> 42:09.445
It's no one's fault.

42:10.985 --> 42:13.579
I have a friend from Ukraine
who's got a gun...

42:13.688 --> 42:16.623
Stepan!
...from the war in Afghanistan.

42:16.691 --> 42:18.420
Don't talk about guns.

42:19.561 --> 42:24.225
I dealt with the <i>vory v zakone</i>
when I worked for the KGB.

42:24.833 --> 42:27.461
You never worked
for the fucking KGB.

42:28.703 --> 42:30.227
I was an auxiliary!

42:32.107 --> 42:34.041
What did this man want?

42:37.178 --> 42:38.941
He wants the diary.

42:40.448 --> 42:44.646
And in return he'll give us
Tatiana's family address.

42:47.422 --> 42:48.753
Christine's family.

42:48.823 --> 42:50.916
You cannot do deals
with those people.

42:50.992 --> 42:54.257
This isn't a deal.
It's an exchange of information.

42:54.329 --> 42:57.093
Have you already forgotten
what I just read to you?

42:57.165 --> 42:59.133
We have to be practical.

43:02.804 --> 43:04.897
I think he was threatening
to harm the baby.

43:04.973 --> 43:06.907
Then it's settled.
No!

43:07.475 --> 43:08.669
Stepan!

43:09.444 --> 43:11.469
This isn't our world.

43:11.546 --> 43:13.446
We are ordinary people.

43:18.119 --> 43:21.748
She was an ordinary person.

43:32.434 --> 43:33.799
Come here.

43:36.237 --> 43:38.228
I've got present for you.

43:49.818 --> 43:51.547
From France.

43:51.619 --> 43:53.018
Old as fuck!

43:58.259 --> 44:00.124
Here.

44:00.195 --> 44:01.594
Open one.

44:01.663 --> 44:03.893
Old is good with wine.

44:05.700 --> 44:10.660
Sixty quid a bottle anywhere. Except
I got this for 10 quid a case, man.

44:11.873 --> 44:13.272
From where?

44:14.342 --> 44:16.401
From where, you don't ask.

44:18.413 --> 44:19.471
Now,

44:21.049 --> 44:22.778
if Papa says okay,

44:24.018 --> 44:27.317
I can start telling you
about the serious stuff.

44:27.388 --> 44:29.822
Import, export.

44:29.891 --> 44:33.520
This booze is just like gifts
for Papa's friends.

44:33.595 --> 44:37.725
The real import stuff is
from Kabul.

44:38.766 --> 44:39.755
You understand?

44:41.202 --> 44:45.263
Papa! You scared me.
What's wrong? We're just sampling.

44:45.340 --> 44:47.137
What's wrong?

44:47.208 --> 44:50.143
Your friend Soyka is dead.

44:51.980 --> 44:54.380
Yeah?

44:54.449 --> 44:58.010
So what? It has nothing
to do with me.

44:58.086 --> 45:00.680
No, no, no. Don't lie to me.

45:00.755 --> 45:02.222
Papa, believe me.

45:02.290 --> 45:05.225
I said don't lie to me!
Papa. Papa!

45:05.293 --> 45:07.523
Don't lie to me!

45:07.595 --> 45:11.292
Kirill. Your dad is right.
No point lying to him.

45:13.735 --> 45:15.498
What are you saying?

45:15.637 --> 45:17.229
Azim's nephew slit
Soyka's throat.

45:18.239 --> 45:20.104
Kirill paid him to do it.

45:20.675 --> 45:22.370
Shut your fucking mouth!

45:22.644 --> 45:25.010
Your dad always
knows the truth.

45:26.481 --> 45:28.506
It's okay, boss.
You don't have to worry.

45:28.583 --> 45:30.710
What? I don't
have to worry?

45:33.187 --> 45:35.587
I got rid of body myself.

45:35.657 --> 45:37.181
Police won't find anything.

45:37.258 --> 45:40.193
My son commits a murder
on my own doorstep.

45:40.261 --> 45:42.126
A fellow soldier.

45:42.196 --> 45:44.528
And no one thought
to tell me about it?

45:44.599 --> 45:48.296
<i>Vory v zakone</i> code says, "Never
speak to anybody about your captain."

45:48.369 --> 45:50.200
Kirill is my captain.

45:51.406 --> 45:53.135
When I find out
what happened,

45:53.207 --> 45:56.699
we do what we have to,
to clean up situation.

45:56.778 --> 45:59.804
Soyka was spreading lies
about Kirill.

45:59.881 --> 46:01.542
About your family.

46:03.918 --> 46:05.818
It was the right thing.

46:06.955 --> 46:10.186
I decide what's right
and what's wrong.

46:10.258 --> 46:14.024
You do not kill a <i>vor</i>
for no reason.

46:15.530 --> 46:18.988
You know as well as I do,
Soyka was talking to police.

46:21.302 --> 46:24.465
For a driver,
you are well-informed.

46:24.539 --> 46:27.565
I have connections
with Chechens exporting cars.

46:27.642 --> 46:32.511
They tell me Soyka speaks
to Russian desk, Scotland Yard.

46:33.147 --> 46:35.377
Kirill did the right thing.

46:35.750 --> 46:39.311
He did a good thing for our people.
They will appreciate that.

46:39.754 --> 46:43.155
Yeah, Papa! I swear.
Shut up!

46:48.663 --> 46:50.961
If you are so well-informed,

46:52.400 --> 46:57.303
you will know Soyka
has brothers.

46:58.673 --> 47:00.971
That's okay.
Kirill has got me.

47:01.743 --> 47:03.108
It's okay?

47:05.780 --> 47:06.872
Okay.

47:09.484 --> 47:11.384
Get boxes out of sight.

47:20.461 --> 47:23.988
So you heard him, <i>patsan!</i>
Now you get these boxes out of sight.

47:24.899 --> 47:27.026
Ok, ok.

47:37.712 --> 47:39.373
Here.
Thank you.

47:44.886 --> 47:47.081
How can you eat?
I'm hungry.

47:54.462 --> 47:56.225
That's their driver.

48:00.401 --> 48:01.925
Here he comes.

48:17.885 --> 48:19.819
Meet in public place...

48:21.089 --> 48:23.455
Lot of people around.
Very wise.

48:25.893 --> 48:29.226
And I see
you bring bodyguards.

48:30.364 --> 48:31.661
Also very wise.

48:31.833 --> 48:34.734
When I was in the KGB, we knew
how to deal with scum like you.

48:35.636 --> 48:37.968
And you did what there?

48:38.039 --> 48:39.233
Stepan.

48:45.313 --> 48:46.405
Anna?

49:13.541 --> 49:14.667
Okay.

49:16.410 --> 49:17.775
Thank you.

49:18.713 --> 49:21.648
Now, you give me the address.
What address?

49:24.552 --> 49:26.213
Tatiana's family.

49:29.023 --> 49:31.719
I don't know
what you're talking about.

49:33.327 --> 49:36.023
See? You see?
I told you it would
happen like this.

49:36.097 --> 49:37.758
I told you this.
Anna!

49:42.403 --> 49:45.065
She was 14! Read the diary.

49:45.139 --> 49:48.506
She was 14 when he raped her.
You bastards murdered her.

49:48.576 --> 49:50.339
Calm down.

49:50.812 --> 49:55.476
Anger is very dangerous.
Makes people do stupid things.

49:55.550 --> 49:59.509
Please, forget any of this
ever happened.

50:00.822 --> 50:03.154
You're in very wrong place,
Anna Ivanovna.

50:03.224 --> 50:05.749
You belong in there
with nice people.

50:07.461 --> 50:09.691
Stay away from people like me.

50:13.234 --> 50:14.565
Devil!

50:16.571 --> 50:18.095
Motherfucker!

50:18.172 --> 50:19.400
Stepan!

50:35.556 --> 50:39.048
<i>I'm not sure</i>
<i>I can carry on another day.</i>

50:39.126 --> 50:43.085
<i>The windows won't open,</i>
<i>so I can't throw myself out.</i>

50:45.032 --> 50:48.866
<i>They inject me every day</i>
<i>with heroin.</i>

50:48.936 --> 50:52.702
<i>Sometimes I think</i>
<i>this is all a hallucination.</i>

51:06.721 --> 51:11.681
It's always good to have someone
who I can trust to do simple tasks.

51:14.328 --> 51:17.627
In this business,
sometimes the biggest danger

51:17.698 --> 51:21.429
comes from
the most stupid things.

51:21.502 --> 51:25.336
You can't afford to
be careless in any area.

51:41.689 --> 51:47.150
So, what was the lie Soyka
was spreading about my son?

51:47.561 --> 51:49.028
It was nothing important.

51:49.630 --> 51:52.997
Kirill had him killed
for nothing important?

51:56.137 --> 51:58.264
I don't like to repeat this.

51:59.106 --> 52:01.836
For me, you will repeat it.

52:01.909 --> 52:05.868
You play with the prince
to do business with the king.

52:05.947 --> 52:09.940
If you want to do business with me
you must be open with me.

52:11.018 --> 52:12.542
Thieves in law.

52:14.922 --> 52:17.755
So what was Soyka saying
about the prince?

52:21.195 --> 52:22.890
That he's a drunk.

52:28.569 --> 52:29.968
And also,

52:33.140 --> 52:34.402
a queer.

52:43.684 --> 52:46.414
My only son.

52:49.724 --> 52:54.354
You know,
it never snows in this city.

52:55.796 --> 52:57.354
It's never hot.

52:58.199 --> 53:01.862
London is a city
of whores and queers.

53:05.873 --> 53:09.536
I think London is to blame

53:11.078 --> 53:12.636
for what he is.

53:13.948 --> 53:16.178
Why don't you go home?

53:16.250 --> 53:18.912
Cold gets into my bones.

53:18.986 --> 53:23.423
Also, KGB would
be waiting for me.

53:24.592 --> 53:25.684
FSB.

53:26.560 --> 53:29.495
They are called FSB now.

53:29.563 --> 53:33.499
Whatever they call them, they are
worse even than the KGB were.

53:36.303 --> 53:40.103
The midwife said
she had an uncle.

53:40.574 --> 53:41.939
A Russian.

53:43.477 --> 53:45.377
I met him.

53:46.647 --> 53:48.945
So you know
what he looks like.

53:52.953 --> 53:54.147
Yes, yes.

53:55.356 --> 53:57.688
She said he has
read the diary.

53:59.827 --> 54:03.786
You cannot trust a Russian
with that kind of information.

54:08.335 --> 54:09.825
Do you understand me?

54:11.205 --> 54:12.638
Yes.

54:13.841 --> 54:17.743
Perhaps you can
deal with him.

54:42.736 --> 54:47.400
I thought that I should
bring it back before it got stolen.

54:47.475 --> 54:49.409
Lot of villains around.

54:55.015 --> 54:57.711
I have address you wanted.

54:57.785 --> 55:01.016
Small village
outside Novokuznetsk.

55:02.022 --> 55:03.353
I know it.

55:05.326 --> 55:07.760
Not good place
for kid to grow up.

55:09.463 --> 55:11.431
Especially not little girl.

55:11.499 --> 55:15.833
If you want my opinion, she would be
better off in London.

55:15.903 --> 55:17.871
Maybe with you. Why not?

55:37.691 --> 55:39.682
So you've read the diary?

55:44.198 --> 55:46.996
How can you keep doing
what you're doing?

55:53.207 --> 55:54.902
I'm just a driver.

56:03.884 --> 56:06.580
Why'd you bring me this?
I don't know.

56:07.688 --> 56:09.212
I was passing.

56:15.362 --> 56:16.727
Your uncle.

56:18.465 --> 56:20.899
It's true he was in KGB?

56:20.968 --> 56:22.799
I don't know.

56:22.870 --> 56:24.770
Does he live with you?

56:39.086 --> 56:41.748
I fixed it.

56:41.822 --> 56:43.585
Should be okay now.

57:04.144 --> 57:06.374
Hey! Hey!

57:09.984 --> 57:13.078
Excuse me.
Just calm down.

57:15.222 --> 57:17.850
Listen to me.
Just calm down, all right?

57:17.925 --> 57:19.517
Take it easy.

57:23.931 --> 57:25.330
Arsenal!

57:27.201 --> 57:28.395
Arsenal!

57:28.469 --> 57:31.768
Wanker!
Arsenal! Arsenal!

57:33.841 --> 57:35.638
Chelsea!

57:35.709 --> 57:40.476
Arsenal!
Wanker!

57:40.547 --> 57:43.573
Arsenal!
Chelsea! Chelsea!

57:52.192 --> 57:54.353
Arsenal. Arsenal!

57:58.732 --> 58:00.632
For my brother...

59:51.512 --> 59:54.208
They were going to kill me.

59:54.281 --> 59:57.614
Those Chechens are savages.

59:57.684 --> 59:59.982
What did they say
about my son?

01:00:09.396 --> 01:00:11.227
They said

01:00:11.298 --> 01:00:13.926
they would spare me

01:00:14.001 --> 01:00:16.526
only if I delivered
Kirill to them.

01:00:19.940 --> 01:00:22.602
You are being
very, very honest.

01:00:23.377 --> 01:00:28.110
I... I fear you
more than I fear them.

01:00:29.917 --> 01:00:33.876
Never again do business
with any member of my family

01:00:35.389 --> 01:00:36.947
behind my back.

01:00:38.325 --> 01:00:40.156
Never.

01:00:40.227 --> 01:00:44.789
I will never listen
to Kirill again. I swear it.

01:00:46.600 --> 01:00:49.034
Do they know

01:00:49.102 --> 01:00:51.969
where to find Kirill?

01:00:53.040 --> 01:00:55.338
They are like wolves.

01:00:56.810 --> 01:00:59.142
Do they know
what he looks like?

01:00:59.980 --> 01:01:01.777
No.

01:01:01.849 --> 01:01:04.716
They have just arrived
from the mountains.

01:01:06.553 --> 01:01:11.183
Tell them you will
deliver Kirill to them.

01:01:13.660 --> 01:01:15.287
And tell them

01:01:16.797 --> 01:01:18.628
to give you two days.

01:01:22.870 --> 01:01:24.132
Two days.

01:01:26.940 --> 01:01:30.034
<i>I know now, for sure,</i>
<i>that I am pregnant.</i>

01:01:30.110 --> 01:01:32.408
<i>It hasn't begun to show yet.</i>

01:01:32.479 --> 01:01:35.880
<i>After I was raped</i>
<i>they made me take pills.</i>

01:01:35.949 --> 01:01:38.179
<i>But I guess it was too late.</i>

01:01:38.252 --> 01:01:41.688
<i>I am condemned to give birth</i>
<i>to a new life.</i>

01:01:41.755 --> 01:01:46.715
<i>But first, I will try to find</i>
<i>a way to end my own life</i>

01:01:47.361 --> 01:01:49.727
<i>and spare this child the pain.</i>

01:02:54.227 --> 01:02:58.561
What are you doing here?
I don't know. I was passing.

01:02:58.632 --> 01:03:02.295
Well, if you're passing,
just pass.

01:03:03.103 --> 01:03:05.094
You keep on going, bitch.

01:03:05.872 --> 01:03:06.896
Nikolai, come on.

01:03:09.810 --> 01:03:11.471
You should go now.

01:03:13.313 --> 01:03:16.214
Family's important
to you people, isn't it?

01:03:16.984 --> 01:03:18.611
To "you people"?

01:03:20.020 --> 01:03:21.044
What's she talking about?

01:03:21.121 --> 01:03:22.383
I didn't catch it.

01:03:23.523 --> 01:03:24.888
Tell Semyon,

01:03:24.958 --> 01:03:28.155
the baby I delivered
last Sunday is his daughter.

01:03:29.997 --> 01:03:31.464
What did she say?

01:03:31.999 --> 01:03:34.263
I don't know.

01:03:34.668 --> 01:03:39.605
When he raped her, she was a virgin.
Then they gave her pills.

01:03:39.673 --> 01:03:41.641
He has to be the father.

01:03:42.943 --> 01:03:44.843
Kirill! Kirill!

01:03:44.911 --> 01:03:46.378
Shut up, bitch!

01:03:46.446 --> 01:03:47.435
Fuck her, Kirill!

01:03:48.482 --> 01:03:49.506
Forget her.

01:03:49.683 --> 01:03:52.413
She was 14.
She was just a child.

01:03:53.820 --> 01:03:56.653
You don't pronounce
the name of my father.

01:04:02.562 --> 01:04:05.292
You stop talking shit
about him.

01:04:05.365 --> 01:04:07.390
You don't look
at her anymore.

01:04:07.467 --> 01:04:09.332
That's an order.

01:04:12.773 --> 01:04:15.367
Tell him what I said.
Tell him what?

01:04:16.710 --> 01:04:18.735
There is nothing to tell.

01:04:18.812 --> 01:04:20.973
Slaves give birth to slaves.

01:04:22.516 --> 01:04:24.347
Tell him what I said.

01:04:24.885 --> 01:04:26.910
Yes, you know,

01:04:26.987 --> 01:04:31.117
the girl you fucked the other day
in front of me. The Ukrainian bitch.

01:04:31.191 --> 01:04:35.287
Anyway, so, the police arrives,
some ordinary fucking police.

01:04:35.362 --> 01:04:38.889
They just kick down the door
and ask for her by name.

01:04:38.965 --> 01:04:40.193
Then they just
take her away.

01:04:40.267 --> 01:04:44.795
Like some fucking punter just might
have given them her name or something?

01:04:44.871 --> 01:04:48.068
What gives the right to the police
to take our women?

01:04:48.141 --> 01:04:49.165
I don't know.

01:04:50.010 --> 01:04:53.241
Fuck police. Hey, Papa.

01:04:53.313 --> 01:04:55.804
I've never seen so many old people
in one place.

01:04:55.882 --> 01:04:57.543
Whose party is that?

01:04:57.617 --> 01:04:59.346
The Ã¡ngel of death?

01:05:00.287 --> 01:05:01.914
She is one hundred years old.

01:05:02.589 --> 01:05:04.284
I know.
Kirill,

01:05:05.592 --> 01:05:09.028
go down into the cellar
and bring up some brandy.

01:05:11.698 --> 01:05:13.256
Twelve bottles.

01:05:14.835 --> 01:05:16.530
Kolya, you hear that?

01:05:16.603 --> 01:05:20.130
Go down in the cellar.
Get 12 bottles of brandy for Papa.

01:05:20.207 --> 01:05:22.732
No, no. He stays here.

01:05:22.809 --> 01:05:24.800
I want to talk business.

01:05:26.079 --> 01:05:27.341
Business?

01:05:28.448 --> 01:05:29.972
What business?

01:05:31.685 --> 01:05:34.984
Papa! What business?

01:05:35.055 --> 01:05:37.182
His business is my business.

01:05:38.325 --> 01:05:41.419
Go to the cellar, Kirill.

01:05:41.495 --> 01:05:43.258
And take your time.

01:06:01.715 --> 01:06:05.276
So, did you deal with
the old man?

01:06:16.163 --> 01:06:18.688
Good. Good.

01:06:20.133 --> 01:06:22.931
It's time you joined us.

01:06:26.640 --> 01:06:28.107
Thank you...

01:06:28.308 --> 01:06:29.275
Papa.

01:06:30.043 --> 01:06:34.104
<i>You, my dear friend...</i>

01:06:34.548 --> 01:06:38.644
<i>... don't think ill of me.</i>

01:06:41.955 --> 01:06:45.413
<i>In this wilderness...</i>

01:06:46.993 --> 01:06:50.485
<i>... simply bury me.</i>

01:07:04.978 --> 01:07:07.970
My dad swapped a little girl
from Georgia for this shit.

01:07:10.050 --> 01:07:13.952
Don't feel bad for what happened
up there. It's just how he is.

01:07:14.721 --> 01:07:18.054
He plays people against each other.
That's all.

01:07:18.124 --> 01:07:20.922
I understand more and more
how he's like.

01:07:22.929 --> 01:07:24.021
Here.

01:07:24.764 --> 01:07:28.029
Let's drink to
the little Georgian girl.

01:07:37.110 --> 01:07:38.771
I drink alone now?

01:08:01.101 --> 01:08:02.864
He offered me stars.

01:08:06.673 --> 01:08:08.300
I accept.

01:08:52.385 --> 01:08:54.580
You think
I didn't know already?

01:08:54.654 --> 01:08:58.350
He told me before.
It was my fucking idea.

01:09:00.827 --> 01:09:05.264
He said now there are a lot
of things I have to teach you.

01:09:06.832 --> 01:09:08.801
It will take long time.

01:09:09.935 --> 01:09:12.461
I've been protecting you
until now.

01:09:13.640 --> 01:09:14.970
Yes, yes, Kirill.

01:09:17.944 --> 01:09:18.968
Hey...

01:09:19.645 --> 01:09:22.911
You think
I don't know things
that you don't know?

01:09:22.983 --> 01:09:24.678
I am a <i>vor</i> by birth.

01:09:24.984 --> 01:09:27.613
The star's
a fucking birthmark for me!

01:09:28.121 --> 01:09:29.247
I know.

01:09:31.925 --> 01:09:33.358
Don't you forget it.

01:09:44.837 --> 01:09:46.430
Where the fuck do you think
you're going?

01:09:46.506 --> 01:09:48.269
We've got to celebrate.
Come here.

01:09:48.341 --> 01:09:49.569
Help me with the bottles.

01:09:49.642 --> 01:09:52.439
Your dad don't need
bottles anymore.

01:10:24.577 --> 01:10:26.204
Beautiful building...

01:10:30.683 --> 01:10:32.048
Good evening.

01:10:36.089 --> 01:10:38.284
Is everything ok?

01:10:38.758 --> 01:10:40.783
Yes, everything's fine.

01:10:50.003 --> 01:10:54.940
We can see that you were
in prison in Siberia...

01:10:55.275 --> 01:10:57.300
...and that you were a thief.

01:10:58.678 --> 01:11:01.647
My father was
a government worker.

01:11:01.748 --> 01:11:04.046
He fixed the cars
of officials.

01:11:04.150 --> 01:11:08.382
I began by selling the spare parts
when I was fifteen.

01:11:10.423 --> 01:11:12.220
You have no forced tattoos?

01:11:12.659 --> 01:11:13.751
None.

01:11:15.028 --> 01:11:17.758
You were not cooperative?

01:11:18.798 --> 01:11:20.993
I spent two years
in the punishment block.

01:11:22.802 --> 01:11:25.896
You went through the Crosses
in St. Petersburg?

01:11:26.139 --> 01:11:27.834
I was in solitary confinement
a dozen times.

01:11:27.941 --> 01:11:30.341
I was called 'The Stump'
because they couldn't shift me.

01:11:33.313 --> 01:11:36.680
Your father was a bitch and a weak fucker
for working for the Government.

01:11:37.584 --> 01:11:38.608
Right?

01:11:41.454 --> 01:11:42.478
That's right.

01:11:43.256 --> 01:11:45.656
He means nothing to me.

01:11:45.725 --> 01:11:48.159
My mother...
You have no mother.

01:11:48.228 --> 01:11:49.855
She was a whore anyway.

01:11:54.067 --> 01:11:55.125
Yes.

01:12:01.941 --> 01:12:04.102
I have no mother
and no father.

01:12:04.878 --> 01:12:09.042
There is only the code,
the <i>vory v zakone</i> code...

01:12:09.115 --> 01:12:11.777
...which I have
always followed.

01:12:12.986 --> 01:12:16.387
That is why there is an empty space
above your heart...

01:12:18.825 --> 01:12:20.918
...where the stars will go.

01:12:21.494 --> 01:12:23.758
And an empty space
on your knees.

01:12:27.200 --> 01:12:29.191
I am dead already.

01:12:29.435 --> 01:12:30.902
I died when I was fifteen.

01:12:31.237 --> 01:12:34.365
Now I live in the zone
all the time.

01:13:51.985 --> 01:13:54.385
I tried to
get hold of Stepan.

01:13:54.454 --> 01:13:56.354
If he's not at home,
he's usually at his sister's

01:13:56.422 --> 01:13:59.050
but she hasn't heard
from him at all.

01:13:59.959 --> 01:14:02.553
He did spit in
that awful man's face.

01:14:04.998 --> 01:14:08.661
I don't think the driver would do
anything to Stepan.

01:14:08.735 --> 01:14:10.430
How do you know?

01:14:13.406 --> 01:14:16.239
You haven't spoken
to him since, have you?

01:14:32.558 --> 01:14:34.924
You're late.
I know.

01:14:36.529 --> 01:14:37.791
I'm cold.

01:14:41.200 --> 01:14:42.599
Let's go in.

01:14:51.477 --> 01:14:55.846
Semyon recommends these places
for business meetings

01:14:57.917 --> 01:15:01.409
because you can see
what tattoos a man has.

01:15:04.090 --> 01:15:07.719
Come on.
We have a lot to cover.

01:15:09.662 --> 01:15:11.129
Let's cook.

01:15:18.471 --> 01:15:22.202
What you were saying
about Kabul?
Yes.

01:15:24.444 --> 01:15:29.381
Our lines to Kabul are broken
every two or three weeks.

01:15:30.817 --> 01:15:33.183
Why?
Why?

01:15:34.854 --> 01:15:39.052
The Americans.
Fucking NATO.

01:15:49.535 --> 01:15:52.197
Valery Nabokov

01:15:52.271 --> 01:15:57.038
imports flowers and television sets
into this country.

01:15:58.811 --> 01:16:02.247
The television sets are
one in ten.

01:16:03.383 --> 01:16:05.283
That means

01:16:05.351 --> 01:16:10.288
one in ten have cargo
inside them.

01:16:10.723 --> 01:16:12.953
Where do they unload them?

01:16:20.133 --> 01:16:24.627
I will tell you when I return
from the bathroom.

01:16:24.704 --> 01:16:27.366
Okay?
Okay.

01:16:27.440 --> 01:16:28.532
Yeah.

01:16:30.810 --> 01:16:32.505
I will be back.

01:16:33.513 --> 01:16:34.639
Soon.

01:16:37.216 --> 01:16:39.343
"Where do they unload them?"

01:17:02.942 --> 01:17:05.672
Kirill is in there...

01:17:06.412 --> 01:17:08.573
...there, there.

01:17:09.549 --> 01:17:13.679
You will see the stars
there on his chest.

01:17:19.358 --> 01:17:20.382
Well done.

01:18:19.652 --> 01:18:20.846
Are you okay?

01:18:21.621 --> 01:18:22.815
Finish him off.

01:20:55.608 --> 01:20:56.836
Enough.

01:21:48.694 --> 01:21:49.956
My uncle,

01:21:53.232 --> 01:21:56.326
the one who spat in your face,
he's disappeared.

01:21:57.536 --> 01:22:01.495
If we don't hear from him soon,
we're going to the police.

01:22:01.574 --> 01:22:03.542
Do you know where he is?

01:22:06.812 --> 01:22:09.804
Yes. Scotland.

01:22:11.417 --> 01:22:12.748
Edinburgh.

01:22:13.686 --> 01:22:15.551
Five-star hotel.

01:22:18.324 --> 01:22:22.021
Edinburgh?
Your uncle knew too much.

01:22:24.130 --> 01:22:27.691
I was told to send him to heaven
with bullet in his head.

01:22:30.236 --> 01:22:33.763
Instead I sent him
to Edinburgh

01:22:33.839 --> 01:22:35.932
with first-class ticket.

01:22:38.677 --> 01:22:40.008
He's okay.

01:22:41.714 --> 01:22:45.343
He's old school,
he understands situation.

01:22:46.585 --> 01:22:49.145
Exile or death.

01:22:55.227 --> 01:22:58.719
His hotel is called Caledonia.

01:23:05.304 --> 01:23:06.293
Hello.
Hi.

01:23:06.372 --> 01:23:08.806
Nikolai Luzhin, please.

01:23:08.874 --> 01:23:13.368
For that patient, I will need your
security clearance information, please.

01:23:26.292 --> 01:23:28.021
You got my message.

01:23:29.895 --> 01:23:34.423
Using a dead body to file
a progress report is original.

01:23:34.500 --> 01:23:37.333
It must be against
FSB regulations.

01:23:37.403 --> 01:23:39.803
You didn't come here
to give me flowers...

01:23:40.039 --> 01:23:41.063
No.

01:23:41.874 --> 01:23:44.809
In view of what's
happened to you

01:23:44.877 --> 01:23:49.610
and in the light of other
violent incidents associated with you,

01:23:49.682 --> 01:23:51.274
the Russian desk
at Scotland Yard

01:23:51.350 --> 01:23:53.910
have made an official request
to the Russian embassy

01:23:53.986 --> 01:23:57.444
that your undercover operation
in London be terminated.

01:24:00.359 --> 01:24:02.156
You have gone beyond
what was agreed.

01:24:04.330 --> 01:24:09.267
If they terminate operation now
they will be wasting these.

01:24:11.604 --> 01:24:16.337
So you tell the Russian desk
you have seen stars over my heart.

01:24:17.409 --> 01:24:19.707
Tell them
I'm through the door.

01:24:28.888 --> 01:24:31.618
Tell them I'm going to
replace Semyon

01:24:32.091 --> 01:24:34.525
as boss of
London organization.

01:24:36.028 --> 01:24:38.861
What drugs are
they giving you?

01:24:38.931 --> 01:24:41.422
I need you to take Semyon
out of the picture.

01:24:41.500 --> 01:24:44.094
I want you to arrest him.

01:24:44.169 --> 01:24:45.932
Arrest him for what?

01:24:46.538 --> 01:24:47.630
Rape.

01:24:51.810 --> 01:24:53.539
The girl was 14.

01:24:53.612 --> 01:24:57.241
And, of course, she will testify?
She is dead.

01:24:57.316 --> 01:24:59.341
But she had Semyon's baby.

01:25:00.386 --> 01:25:03.549
If you can prove baby was his
and girl was underage,

01:25:03.622 --> 01:25:06.386
that is statutory rape.

01:25:06.458 --> 01:25:09.325
You have baby,
you need Semyon's DNA.

01:25:10.729 --> 01:25:12.390
For poetic reasons

01:25:13.732 --> 01:25:15.927
I suggest you take his blood.

01:25:28.747 --> 01:25:30.442
What are you looking at, baby?

01:25:30.783 --> 01:25:32.148
You.

01:25:35.487 --> 01:25:38.854
What were you and Grandpa
shouting about last night?

01:25:42.995 --> 01:25:45.361
Nothing, baby. Nothing.

01:25:45.431 --> 01:25:47.456
Sounded like something.

01:25:51.470 --> 01:25:55.201
It's just that
someone I know got hurt

01:25:55.574 --> 01:25:57.166
so I blamed it on Grandpa.

01:25:59.278 --> 01:26:02.179
Did you fight each other?
I heard banging.

01:26:05.317 --> 01:26:06.341
No.

01:26:07.619 --> 01:26:11.248
It's not a fight if one of you
doesn't fight back, right?

01:26:37.516 --> 01:26:39.245
Maria, go upstairs.

01:26:40.953 --> 01:26:42.716
Go upstairs, I said.

01:26:51.130 --> 01:26:53.758
So, Papa, what did
they want from you?

01:26:56.769 --> 01:26:58.236
To poison me.

01:27:00.506 --> 01:27:03.134
They took blood from me
with a needle.

01:27:04.376 --> 01:27:07.504
Probably the same needle
they use for the junkies

01:27:07.579 --> 01:27:09.979
and whores and blacks
and queers.

01:27:12.584 --> 01:27:15.985
Now I probably have
the fucking queer disease.

01:27:20.659 --> 01:27:23.253
Why would they want
your blood, Papa?

01:27:34.640 --> 01:27:36.437
Goodbye.
Good night.

01:28:05.270 --> 01:28:07.966
Where have you taken Christine?
Tell me, you bastard!

01:28:08.040 --> 01:28:10.201
You've taken her!
He took her, didn't he?

01:28:10.275 --> 01:28:12.675
What are you talking about?

01:28:18.283 --> 01:28:20.979
I saw Kirill. I thought...

01:29:17.643 --> 01:29:19.110
Forgive me.

01:29:21.480 --> 01:29:23.107
Forgive me, baby.

01:29:24.383 --> 01:29:25.907
Sorry.

01:29:44.336 --> 01:29:46.327
She's just a little girl!

01:29:48.106 --> 01:29:51.269
She's just a little
fucking <i>devochka,</i> Papa!

01:29:53.011 --> 01:29:54.273
Kirill.

01:29:59.785 --> 01:30:01.582
Let me take the baby.

01:30:03.722 --> 01:30:05.815
Please, she's cold.

01:30:15.234 --> 01:30:17.031
We don't kill babies.

01:30:19.671 --> 01:30:22.003
This will be bad for us.

01:30:22.074 --> 01:30:24.440
Your father has gone too far.

01:30:26.411 --> 01:30:32.509
You're either with him
or with me.

01:30:52.838 --> 01:30:57.673
With him or with me.

01:31:00.312 --> 01:31:03.873
I swear I didn't know
my Papa was setting you up.

01:31:06.118 --> 01:31:07.346
I know.

01:31:07.986 --> 01:31:10.420
I know, Kirill.

01:31:14.993 --> 01:31:17.291
Give her to me.

01:31:32.744 --> 01:31:34.803
Your father's going away.

01:31:34.880 --> 01:31:38.316
The family business will be yours.
It's our time.

01:31:38.784 --> 01:31:40.547
You're the boss now.

01:31:42.521 --> 01:31:45.922
You're the boss.
Now we are partners.

01:31:48.226 --> 01:31:49.693
That's right.

01:31:51.530 --> 01:31:53.862
Why don't we go home?
Come on.

01:31:55.033 --> 01:31:57.593
I'll take you home.
No.

01:31:57.669 --> 01:32:01.696
We're missing the fucking party
of the year! Happy New Year!

01:32:01.773 --> 01:32:02.865
Let's go.

01:32:03.775 --> 01:32:04.833
Come on!

01:32:05.877 --> 01:32:07.071
That's an order!

01:32:11.350 --> 01:32:12.817
You are okay?

01:32:14.319 --> 01:32:16.412
I need to know who you are.

01:32:19.358 --> 01:32:21.121
Why did you help us?

01:32:23.729 --> 01:32:28.132
How can I become king,
if king is still in place?

01:32:38.944 --> 01:32:41.174
Bless you.

01:33:10.375 --> 01:33:14.641
Goodbye, Anna Ivanovna.

01:33:28.660 --> 01:33:30.059
It's okay.

01:33:31.229 --> 01:33:32.560
Nikolai!

01:34:13.972 --> 01:34:17.533
My little Russian doll...

01:34:22.180 --> 01:34:24.080
We're gonna go
and get something.

01:34:25.050 --> 01:34:29.612
Should we see Mama? Should we see Mama?
Yeah. Come on.

01:34:30.522 --> 01:34:31.511
Yeah, come on.

01:34:33.425 --> 01:34:36.588
Here she is.
There's your Mama.

01:34:36.661 --> 01:34:38.891
Here she is,
my little Ã¡ngel.

01:34:40.065 --> 01:34:42.465
My muffin.

01:34:42.534 --> 01:34:44.092
Are you hungry?

01:34:46.338 --> 01:34:47.635
Are you?

01:34:55.347 --> 01:34:56.974
Who wants dinner?

01:34:57.916 --> 01:34:59.850
<i>My name is Tatiana.</i>

01:35:00.919 --> 01:35:04.355
<i>My father died in the mines</i>
<i>in my village,</i>

01:35:04.422 --> 01:35:07.983
<i>so he was already buried</i>
<i>when he died.</i>

01:35:08.059 --> 01:35:09.856
<i>We were all buried there.</i>

01:35:09.928 --> 01:35:12.294
<i>Buried under the soil</i>
<i>of Russia.</i>

01:35:13.665 --> 01:35:17.624
<i>That is why I left,</i>
<i>to find a better life.</i>
