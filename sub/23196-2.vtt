WEBVTT

00:03.461 --> 00:05.921
Ohh. Oh, man.

00:08.173 --> 00:10.718
I hope you know you're
cleaning that up, Lawrence.

00:10.718 --> 00:13.137
Unless you want another
reason to be suspended.

00:15.056 --> 00:18.851
Anywho, we're off for a quick
jaunt round the racquetball court.

00:18.851 --> 00:20.727
Don't wait up, baby cat.

00:23.856 --> 00:26.066
Law? Did you hear me?

00:26.067 --> 00:27.526
Said we're getting snacks.

00:29.278 --> 00:31.780
Do you want snacks?

00:33.699 --> 00:35.325
Well, bye.

00:46.629 --> 00:48.130
Jenny! Hi!

00:48.130 --> 00:50.507
Um, so you know how
I'm undeclared right now?

00:50.508 --> 00:53.093
Well, I was thinking that
I would shadow FPS tomorrow.

00:53.094 --> 00:55.012
That is so awesome!

00:55.012 --> 00:57.305
I can't wait to see you there.

00:57.306 --> 00:58.640
Hey, gals.

01:06.190 --> 01:07.441
Let's do it!

01:11.529 --> 01:12.571
Is something burning?

02:02.246 --> 02:04.665
Ll can't believe she's making us
practice through brunch.

02:04.665 --> 02:06.625
Yeah, Jenny,
tell your mom my stomach said,

02:06.626 --> 02:08.544
"hey, this is your
stomach, Jumpin' Jacks,

02:08.544 --> 02:10.963
and I'm hungry, so tell Jenny."

02:10.963 --> 02:12.714
Yeah, I'll be sure
and pass that along.

02:12.715 --> 02:16.009
But in the meantime,
what do I do with these donuts?

02:16.010 --> 02:17.636
Ohhh!

02:20.389 --> 02:22.140
Donuts! Sweet! What?

02:22.141 --> 02:23.308
Sorry, Brian.

02:23.309 --> 02:24.435
Sorry.

02:24.435 --> 02:25.769
Here?

02:28.022 --> 02:29.815
Drop those donuts, sugarplums.

02:29.815 --> 02:32.192
Behold the Mary Matrix diet.

02:32.193 --> 02:35.029
That's right.
Healthy food forever.

02:35.029 --> 02:37.364
Every time you stuff those
little faces with junk food,

02:37.365 --> 02:40.826
you are missing out on thorine,
omega-3s, antioxidants.

02:40.826 --> 02:43.078
It's killing your reaction time.

02:43.079 --> 02:44.955
Observe.

02:49.085 --> 02:51.128
Fit bodies, fit minds.

02:51.128 --> 02:52.629
Which reminds me,

02:52.630 --> 02:54.590
30 laps around the quad
before lunch.

02:54.590 --> 02:55.882
But we're starving!

02:55.883 --> 02:58.468
Get a move on! Go!

02:58.469 --> 03:00.679
Go, go, go!

03:02.139 --> 03:03.181
Brian, stay.

03:06.143 --> 03:08.436
So how is it living with Law?

03:08.437 --> 03:10.355
<i>Actually, I'm glad you ask.</i>

03:10.356 --> 03:12.066
Um, not too hot.

03:12.066 --> 03:13.650
Well, actually it is too hot

03:13.651 --> 03:16.779
because, uh,
he set fire to my room.

03:16.779 --> 03:20.407
Really? He sounds miserable.
Good work, kid.

03:20.408 --> 03:22.660
Yeah, I guess, but...

03:22.660 --> 03:25.579
Wait. That's why you
made him my roommate?

03:25.579 --> 03:27.455
I knew living with you
would remind him

03:27.456 --> 03:29.332
of what a failure he is.

03:29.333 --> 03:32.419
Between you and me,
he's the worst guy that Jenny ever dated.

03:32.420 --> 03:36.048
Oh, well, between you and me,
he set fire to my room.

03:37.591 --> 03:40.093
You just being cute,
or you talking back to me?

03:41.387 --> 03:43.180
Better go run laps now.

03:43.180 --> 03:44.180
Mmm.

03:46.559 --> 03:49.103
Which brings us to the crux
of the query:

03:49.103 --> 03:53.524
How fast should car "a's"
speed be going into turn 7?

03:53.524 --> 03:55.275
Pick me! Pick me, I'm awesome!

03:55.276 --> 03:58.696
Theodore, the court is yours.

03:58.696 --> 04:03.196
Given his entry line,
he should be going 55 miles per hour.

04:03.200 --> 04:05.619
You're an idiot!

04:05.619 --> 04:07.245
How 'bout 48 miles per hour?

04:07.246 --> 04:09.539
Bravo, clutch.
Three hundred yards.

04:09.540 --> 04:11.083
Yeah!

04:11.083 --> 04:13.543
You have passed the soda star.

04:13.544 --> 04:16.129
Soda star!

04:22.553 --> 04:25.013
Aw, man! There's no pop!

04:25.014 --> 04:27.099
The fizzy river runs dry?

04:28.350 --> 04:31.019
Something's amiss.

04:31.020 --> 04:32.980
Where are piston
and domino prime?

04:34.231 --> 04:36.149
Piston! And you, domino prime!

04:36.150 --> 04:37.317
W-What happened?

04:39.487 --> 04:40.863
The duchess?

04:40.863 --> 04:42.531
She and her kart goons
knew of our plan

04:42.531 --> 04:43.823
to raid the teachers' lounge.

04:43.824 --> 04:45.659
They ambushed us
and took the soda,

04:45.659 --> 04:47.285
but we have the key.

04:47.286 --> 04:49.079
Ohh.

04:49.079 --> 04:50.747
For this I am glad.

04:50.748 --> 04:55.127
But alas, the duchess of kart
has rendered us sodaless.

04:55.127 --> 04:57.671
Our throats shall
remain parched for a week.

04:57.671 --> 05:00.173
Perhaps even two.

05:00.174 --> 05:01.842
Truly this is our darkest hour.

05:04.762 --> 05:06.472
I'll get the sodas.

05:08.098 --> 05:11.893
I can do it, d.K. I was born to.

05:11.894 --> 05:13.854
Fat chance, dingus.

05:13.854 --> 05:16.189
Those 'shroomed-up kart sharks
will eat you alive.

05:16.190 --> 05:17.774
Perhaps, child.

05:17.775 --> 05:19.651
But per another hap,

05:19.652 --> 05:21.862
this may be Theodore's chance

05:21.862 --> 05:23.905
to prove his quality.

05:26.200 --> 05:28.493
Drift like the wind, little one.

05:28.494 --> 05:30.746
You carry the fate of us all.

05:38.212 --> 05:39.755
They're both red and healthy.

05:39.755 --> 05:40.922
Just pick one, kid.

05:42.508 --> 05:44.009
Oh. Sorry.

05:51.684 --> 05:54.269
Wait, what?

05:54.270 --> 05:56.855
Brian d! Get your ass
to my office!

05:56.856 --> 05:58.148
Double time!

05:58.148 --> 05:59.274
Aw, man.

05:59.275 --> 06:00.275
Next.

06:16.542 --> 06:18.794
So, Allison, you're losing.

06:18.794 --> 06:20.796
That's nice. Hey, quick q.

06:20.796 --> 06:23.465
You know any brasseries that do
last-minute lunch rezzies?

06:23.465 --> 06:26.551
I could really crush a good
wine-and-cheese pairing

06:26.552 --> 06:28.220
after you give me those two g's.

06:28.220 --> 06:31.097
Sorry, Shane. The only thing
on the menu is a flank steak.

06:33.851 --> 06:37.729
Oh. Is that you flanking me,
or are you just trying

06:37.730 --> 06:39.606
to make the whole food joke
thing work?

06:39.607 --> 06:42.318
Either way I'm winning,
so, about those two g's,

06:42.318 --> 06:44.778
if you could just
type them in now for me.

06:46.238 --> 06:47.405
"G" for "good."

06:50.993 --> 06:53.453
Okay, now "g" for "game."

06:53.454 --> 06:56.206
Come on, Allie-gator.

06:56.206 --> 06:57.248
Gimme the game.

06:58.876 --> 07:00.627
Gimme the game.

07:02.504 --> 07:04.797
Actually, his planes
can't refuel,

07:04.798 --> 07:06.883
so if you regroup
in the mountains to the south...

07:06.884 --> 07:08.635
Okay, guys, who's the nerd?

07:08.636 --> 07:12.723
<i>Oh. Ki Swan, 1,500 points.
Ex-rhythm gamer.</i>

07:12.723 --> 07:14.433
Ll have been shadowing
classes all day long,

07:14.433 --> 07:16.560
and I have to say that RTS
is the first one

07:16.560 --> 07:19.145
that has really spoken to me,
which is why I'm speaking now,

07:19.146 --> 07:21.982
and I would be honored
to try out for your team.

07:21.982 --> 07:24.693
I don't know, Ki. Are you cool?

07:24.693 --> 07:26.194
I never thought so, no.

07:26.195 --> 07:27.696
It's not cool to tell the truth.

07:27.696 --> 07:30.657
But we'll give it
to the floor. Buy or sell?

07:30.658 --> 07:33.452
- She doesn't even wear a suit.
- She looks like a square.

07:33.452 --> 07:34.911
Oh, she's nice once
you get to know her.

07:34.912 --> 07:36.955
She talks about herself
in the third person.

07:36.956 --> 07:38.624
Sell this Turkey!

07:38.624 --> 07:40.959
<i>Sorry, Ki.
Go suck somewhere else.</i>

08:00.104 --> 08:02.147
Nothing better than
a fourth taco, you feel me?

08:05.943 --> 08:07.194
Ahh.

08:13.742 --> 08:15.910
- You lost your scholarship.
- What?

08:15.911 --> 08:17.287
After the Law's fiasco,

08:17.287 --> 08:19.747
the nea pulled
the golden gun Grant,

08:19.748 --> 08:21.374
so...

08:21.375 --> 08:23.293
Yeah.

08:23.293 --> 08:24.335
It's all here.

08:27.256 --> 08:29.883
Ho-Kay.

08:29.883 --> 08:32.719
I have no money,
so is there like, uh,

08:32.720 --> 08:34.513
like a work-study program
1 could do??

08:34.513 --> 08:37.849
Like, maybe I could start in
the library and do some filing.

08:37.850 --> 08:39.934
Or, hey, do you need
a personal assistant?

08:39.934 --> 08:42.354
I make a mean cup of Joe.

08:44.188 --> 08:45.231
What...?

08:53.407 --> 08:54.491
A janitor!

08:56.035 --> 08:57.828
When do I start?

08:57.828 --> 09:01.915
You can start now,
with all that.

09:01.915 --> 09:04.459
So you want me to just,
like, put it back?

09:17.806 --> 09:18.848
Ha!

09:31.361 --> 09:33.738
It's tubular!

09:33.739 --> 09:34.990
Yes!

10:05.562 --> 10:07.814
Who's in this box?

10:10.609 --> 10:12.068
Mr. Wong?

10:12.069 --> 10:13.653
Your car's getting towed.

10:13.654 --> 10:15.864
I left the hazards on!

10:21.120 --> 10:23.747
He's gone. You can come out.

10:28.418 --> 10:30.420
Hey, thanks for the save
back there.

10:30.420 --> 10:33.131
Oh, um... my name is Ted.

10:33.132 --> 10:34.132
What's yours?

10:42.641 --> 10:43.683
You're welcome.

10:48.397 --> 10:50.899
Oh, my god!
I just cheated on Ki!

10:56.697 --> 10:58.448
I'm a terrible ninja.

11:09.668 --> 11:11.461
Ted, your entire floor
is yelling at me

11:11.461 --> 11:13.588
about some guy acting gross
in the study room,

11:13.589 --> 11:16.925
so just act like an r.A.
For once and deal with it.

11:16.925 --> 11:19.719
- What are you doing here?
- Get out of my room.

11:19.720 --> 11:21.430
1 am out of your room.
This is Ted's room.

11:21.430 --> 11:22.597
No, Ted moved in with Brian,

11:22.598 --> 11:23.682
and Jenny never
showed me my room,

11:23.682 --> 11:25.141
so I moved into Ted's room.

11:25.142 --> 11:26.726
Why is that so hard
for people to understand?

11:26.727 --> 11:28.729
I understand.
Tell Ted he's fired...

11:28.729 --> 11:31.314
- and you're his replacement.
- What? You can't do that.

11:31.315 --> 11:35.235
Actually, as head r.A.,
I can do whatever I want, probably.

11:35.235 --> 11:37.862
Either way, looks like you found
yourself something to do, Ki.

11:37.863 --> 11:39.489
Here. Trying
to get rid of these.

11:39.489 --> 11:42.033
Business cards. So last year.

11:44.161 --> 11:45.912
Your name is Shane pizza?

11:47.164 --> 11:48.999
That's dumb!

11:48.999 --> 11:50.333
Flip it over.

11:59.426 --> 12:00.969
You know...

12:00.969 --> 12:03.596
I was voted "petite elite's"
hunkiest teen gamer.

12:05.891 --> 12:09.519
Well, look at me now, Wendell!

12:09.519 --> 12:11.229
I don't want to, okay?
1 just want to study.

12:11.230 --> 12:13.273
You look at me, Wendell!

12:13.273 --> 12:14.983
Excuse me.

12:14.983 --> 12:16.025
Hi.

12:16.026 --> 12:18.278
Law?

12:18.278 --> 12:20.530
I think you should go be
gross somewhere else now.

12:23.492 --> 12:26.119
Um, okay, so if you
could just stop...

12:30.207 --> 12:32.209
Law, could you, um...

12:34.294 --> 12:36.087
Well, now, how would you
feel if someone...

12:40.175 --> 12:41.676
You're being very rude.

12:43.262 --> 12:46.390
Law, this is an inappropriate
use of the common area,

12:46.390 --> 12:49.309
and you are disrespecting
your fellow students,

12:49.309 --> 12:50.977
and as newly named r.A.,

12:50.978 --> 12:53.146
ll demand that you leave.

12:53.146 --> 12:55.648
Oh! You're the r.A. Now.

12:55.649 --> 12:57.859
- That's right.
- How interesting.

12:57.859 --> 13:00.695
Well, we gotta uphold the rules
around here, right, Wendell?

13:00.696 --> 13:04.366
We all know how important
the Law is around here!

13:09.162 --> 13:12.331
Wow. 1 have no idea
what I ever saw in that guy.

13:12.332 --> 13:14.751
<i>- Smells like bananas.
- Thanks, Ki.</i>

13:14.751 --> 13:17.211
You're welcome, Wendell.

13:23.760 --> 13:24.886
Hmm.

14:14.895 --> 14:18.982
Eat later, Brian!
Twenty laps before practice. Let's go!

14:18.982 --> 14:20.608
Come on, Brian,
the janitor will get it.

14:27.324 --> 14:28.742
Theodore Wong...

14:28.742 --> 14:31.077
For quenching the thirst
of your teammates

14:31.078 --> 14:33.538
and risking certain detention
in the process,

14:33.538 --> 14:36.332
I award you 3,000 yards.

14:38.877 --> 14:40.086
Way to go, Ted!

14:41.880 --> 14:44.632
Clutch, an ice-cool
cola for Ted.

14:50.555 --> 14:54.058
I believed in you
all along, Ted.

14:54.059 --> 14:58.559
So, regale us with your
tales of derring-do.

14:59.648 --> 15:00.815
Okay.

15:00.816 --> 15:03.944
So, there I was,

15:03.944 --> 15:06.988
opening the door
to the teachers' lounge,

15:06.988 --> 15:09.949
and then taking all the sodas,

15:09.950 --> 15:11.201
and then leaving.

15:17.499 --> 15:18.917
Oh? Uh...

15:18.917 --> 15:21.127
Any complications?

15:21.128 --> 15:22.712
Any arousals?

15:22.712 --> 15:24.547
What? No, never!

15:24.548 --> 15:26.341
I'd never hurt Ki.

15:26.341 --> 15:28.551
Ah, which reminds me. My key.

15:28.552 --> 15:30.303
The most precious of my items.

15:32.055 --> 15:35.475
Oh, um, it's... Just... it's...

15:35.475 --> 15:37.435
Right over here, d.K.

15:37.436 --> 15:39.855
Duchess! You fiend!

15:39.855 --> 15:41.857
D.k., you're so cute
when you're angry.

15:41.857 --> 15:43.692
Cute? Don't lecture me
about cute

15:43.692 --> 15:45.110
when your game has
a banana on the cover,

15:45.110 --> 15:46.486
and anytime someone gets hit,

15:46.486 --> 15:48.154
they go, "ow wow wow wow wow."

15:48.155 --> 15:49.906
We're not getting
into this again.

15:49.906 --> 15:52.408
Enjoy your high horse.
We'll enjoy our sodas.

15:52.409 --> 15:54.202
Karters, let's boost.

15:54.202 --> 15:55.828
- Let's go.
- I'm the best!

15:58.790 --> 16:00.416
Thanks for last night, hotlips.

16:00.417 --> 16:02.419
Come by for a drink sometime.

16:03.879 --> 16:06.965
Theodore!
I'm not sure what sort of

16:06.965 --> 16:10.343
modern arrangements
you and Ki have,

16:10.343 --> 16:14.180
but you have hurt me more deeply
than you can ever imagine.

16:14.181 --> 16:15.849
D.k., I...

16:15.849 --> 16:17.433
I always hated you, Ted.

16:25.901 --> 16:26.943
My first suggestion!

16:31.490 --> 16:33.742
Oh, it's a complaint.

16:33.742 --> 16:36.286
Huh.

16:36.286 --> 16:38.830
<i>"Dear Ki, I'd like to apologize"</i>

16:38.830 --> 16:41.123
"for being totally rudesville
in the study lounge,"

16:41.124 --> 16:43.835
"but I'd also like to file
a formal complaint"

16:43.835 --> 16:46.295
"against Ted Wong
(Your boyfriend? Irrelevant)"

16:46.296 --> 16:48.381
"For illegally squatting
in my dorm."

16:48.381 --> 16:50.883
"You see, Ted never officially
moved in with Brian."

16:50.884 --> 16:52.385
"I did."

16:52.385 --> 16:55.012
"And Ted... well, he's
your kissin' buddy,"

16:55.013 --> 16:58.599
“1 don't need to tell you
how bad he smells. Phew!!

16:58.600 --> 17:01.060
"Wow, I can't believe I wrote
'phew' in a letter.

17:01.061 --> 17:03.855
"Well, anyway, it's your duty
as r.A. To kick him out.

17:03.855 --> 17:05.397
Sincerely..."

17:05.397 --> 17:07.316
The Law!

17:07.317 --> 17:10.862
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

17:10.862 --> 17:11.904
1 just did that.

17:28.003 --> 17:30.923
Watching you play now
makes me want to throw up.

17:30.924 --> 17:31.966
Yes, ma'am.

17:33.468 --> 17:34.552
I'm sorry, ma'am.

17:39.474 --> 17:42.727
<i>You can do this.
Don't think about food.</i>

17:42.727 --> 17:45.187
Don't think about food.
Just don't think about food.

17:59.911 --> 18:02.204
What is happening?

18:02.205 --> 18:04.290
Brian! Get it together!

18:04.291 --> 18:05.917
Coach, I gotta pee.

18:12.299 --> 18:13.633
No! No!

18:16.428 --> 18:17.762
Please!

18:17.762 --> 18:19.847
Please, come on, I'm so hungry'!

19:02.390 --> 19:04.600
Eat me.

19:04.601 --> 19:06.185
Eat me.

19:06.186 --> 19:08.396
Eat me.

19:08.396 --> 19:11.357
Eat me.

19:16.154 --> 19:18.281
Brian, is that jelly
on your shirt?

19:20.367 --> 19:22.035
Yes.

19:22.035 --> 19:24.162
- Get out of my practice.
- Wait, coach, I hadn't eaten...

19:24.162 --> 19:25.722
<i>Don't come to practice
tomorrow, either.</i>

19:27.874 --> 19:29.709
You want to say anything else?

19:35.382 --> 19:37.509
Woman: Just remember, guys:
No gettysburger is complete

19:37.509 --> 19:39.344
without the barbecue sauce.

19:40.845 --> 19:42.680
To history, everybody!

19:44.391 --> 19:46.851
So hypothetically, if
the duchess of kart kissed me

19:46.851 --> 19:48.978
and I didn't want to kiss her
and I didn't like it,

19:48.978 --> 19:50.813
would you be mad?

19:50.814 --> 19:52.374
No, as long as you were
honest about it.

19:54.067 --> 19:55.818
Thanks, Ki. You're awesome.

19:55.819 --> 19:58.696
Hey, Ted, you got
a thing on the thing.

19:59.989 --> 20:01.031
Huh.

20:03.410 --> 20:05.537
What is this?

20:05.537 --> 20:07.997
I'm getting evicted?
This can't be happening.

20:07.997 --> 20:09.415
I'm gonna lose Brian?

20:09.416 --> 20:11.918
Brian!

20:11.918 --> 20:13.419
Brian, are you here?

20:13.420 --> 20:16.214
Everything is fine.
This was a joke. 1 made it.

20:16.214 --> 20:17.715
And it was funny.

20:17.716 --> 20:19.801
That's so not funny.

20:19.801 --> 20:22.804
How could you even think
about separating me and Brian?

20:22.804 --> 20:25.681
We're more than
just Brian and Ted.

20:25.682 --> 20:27.558
We're bread. Or trian.

20:27.559 --> 20:29.477
No! We're bread.

20:29.477 --> 20:31.645
And you can't separate
slices of bread,

20:31.646 --> 20:33.522
unless you put meat
or lettuce in between,

20:33.523 --> 20:35.191
<i>but then you get a sandwich, Ki,</i>

20:35.191 --> 20:36.817
and nothing can stop a sandwich

20:36.818 --> 20:38.194
from getting the key
back from the duchess,

20:38.194 --> 20:41.030
as long as that sandwich
is named me and Brian.

20:42.949 --> 20:44.869
By the way, Brian, I need
your help on something.

20:46.453 --> 20:47.453
I'll get a shirt.

20:51.958 --> 20:53.334
Let's go.

20:53.334 --> 20:54.835
<i>Thanks for the pep talk, Ki.</i>

20:54.836 --> 20:56.212
Mwah!

20:57.881 --> 20:59.132
Good luck, boys.

21:07.098 --> 21:08.557
You.

21:08.558 --> 21:10.101
Me.

21:15.523 --> 21:16.941
It's so hot in here.

21:26.409 --> 21:29.912
Teddy bear! Here for that drink?

21:29.913 --> 21:33.625
No way, "dorkchess."
I'm here for d.K.'S key.

21:37.712 --> 21:40.631
<i>And 've brought backup.</i>

21:40.632 --> 21:43.259
Oh, yeah, he's tough.
He's tougher than all...

21:45.345 --> 21:47.930
seven of you.

21:47.931 --> 21:49.599
Hi.

21:59.526 --> 22:01.027
You're on, Theodore.

22:01.027 --> 22:03.904
But we're taking this rumble
to the streets...

22:06.783 --> 22:08.785
of banana kart battle mode.

22:08.785 --> 22:10.328
Nice!

22:10.328 --> 22:14.081
1 win, ll get the key back.

22:14.082 --> 22:16.459
I win, you join my team.

22:19.420 --> 22:21.797
Ted, this is crazy.
There's no way we can beat 'em.

22:21.798 --> 22:23.424
Plus, it wasn't even your fault.

22:23.424 --> 22:24.967
It doesn't matter.

22:24.968 --> 22:29.013
I let my team down.
I gotta make that right...

22:29.013 --> 22:30.973
No matter the cost.

22:30.974 --> 22:32.225
You got my back?

22:36.479 --> 22:37.771
Let's kart.

23:12.807 --> 23:13.849
Ohh!

23:31.659 --> 23:32.951
Ughhh!

23:36.289 --> 23:37.331
Dang it!

23:41.544 --> 23:46.044
And that brings us finally
to article g, section 2:

23:46.049 --> 23:47.508
Ted showers twice a day

23:47.508 --> 23:49.384
to stop him
from being so smelly.

23:49.385 --> 23:50.844
Great. I think
that's everything.

23:50.845 --> 23:53.264
Oh. Okay.

23:53.264 --> 23:55.808
Sign there, and Ted
becomes your new roommate.

23:55.808 --> 23:57.100
Thanks a lot, Ki.

23:57.101 --> 23:58.519
I know these negotiations

23:58.519 --> 24:00.479
have been a little
tough, but, uh...

24:00.480 --> 24:02.398
You're sticking
your neck out for me,

24:02.398 --> 24:04.358
and not many people are
willing to do that these days,

24:04.359 --> 24:06.069
so I just wanted to say
I appreciate it.

24:06.069 --> 24:07.570
I'm glad I could help.

24:07.570 --> 24:09.488
- Just trying to do my job.
- Sure.

24:11.282 --> 24:12.491
Fart noises?

24:15.536 --> 24:18.705
But... Hours of negotiation.

24:18.706 --> 24:21.208
You got everything you wanted.
Why are you doing this?

24:21.209 --> 24:23.294
To make your life miserable.

24:23.294 --> 24:25.504
And now, you're going
to have to explain

24:25.505 --> 24:27.298
to your two miserable friends

24:27.298 --> 24:29.675
that they can't be
roommates anymore.

24:29.676 --> 24:32.470
Because "Ki Swan, r.A.,"

24:32.470 --> 24:36.970
<i>stands for "Ki Swan,
really awful at being an r.A"</i>

24:37.433 --> 24:40.185
now, get out of my room.

24:51.322 --> 24:52.364
Ow.

25:30.820 --> 25:32.279
I'm gonna need a bigger box.

25:37.410 --> 25:38.953
Brian, split!

25:47.962 --> 25:49.004
Yes!

26:10.943 --> 26:12.402
Hi, Law.

26:18.034 --> 26:21.579
This is Ted's favorite pizza,
double wasabinero.

26:21.579 --> 26:23.080
He was saving the leftovers.

26:26.209 --> 26:27.543
Go on.

26:32.006 --> 26:35.342
Brian hates it when
you borrow his shampoo

26:35.343 --> 26:39.843
and, uh, spray it
all over his bed.

26:41.057 --> 26:43.684
You really shouldn't
have done this, Law.

26:49.440 --> 26:51.817
Hmm.

26:51.818 --> 26:53.945
This is Brian and Ted's
favorite photo.

26:56.781 --> 27:00.034
Come on. You really want
Ted to leave and miss out

27:00.034 --> 27:04.288
on the chance to make them
miserable every single day?

27:05.540 --> 27:07.166
You're right, Ki.

27:08.417 --> 27:11.169
This place is a canvas!

27:12.672 --> 27:14.382
Let's get painting!

27:15.633 --> 27:16.884
Okay!

27:19.720 --> 27:21.972
Bomb? Wait.

27:43.327 --> 27:44.327
Whoo!

27:46.247 --> 27:48.290
Yeah! No! No, no, no!

27:54.589 --> 27:55.798
I'm sorry.

28:00.386 --> 28:02.596
No! Aah!

28:05.391 --> 28:06.558
Come on.

28:06.559 --> 28:08.018
Start. Start!

28:49.101 --> 28:50.435
Ted.

29:32.144 --> 29:34.312
Aaaahhh!

29:34.313 --> 29:36.732
Aaahhhh!

29:36.732 --> 29:38.859
- Yes!
- Team bread!

29:38.859 --> 29:40.527
Whoo! Ha ha ha!

29:40.528 --> 29:42.696
Idiot!

29:42.697 --> 29:45.866
We play this game every day!

29:45.866 --> 29:48.368
Whoo! What a rush!

29:48.369 --> 29:49.995
I feel like a new man.

29:51.414 --> 29:53.457
Boy, Ted is going
to be extra upset

29:53.457 --> 29:55.167
when I have you evict him!

29:58.379 --> 30:00.047
All right. Fine.

30:00.047 --> 30:01.798
Ted can stay.

30:01.799 --> 30:02.841
Ow.

30:04.093 --> 30:05.594
Complaint resolved.

30:05.594 --> 30:09.014
Resolved by punching me
in the face.

30:09.015 --> 30:10.933
And then, out of nowhere,
it was like...

30:12.852 --> 30:14.770
<i>And I was like,
"oh, no, 'm gonna die."</i>

30:14.770 --> 30:17.439
And Brian was all, "no way,
bro, I'm dying for you."

30:19.442 --> 30:21.360
Yeah, and then we won later.
It was awesome.

30:21.360 --> 30:22.652
Here's your key.

30:22.653 --> 30:25.447
Theodore, I'm impressed.

30:25.448 --> 30:27.116
Brian, ditto.

30:28.826 --> 30:29.910
Have some sodas.

30:29.910 --> 30:32.037
- Oh, yeah!
- Oh, cool.

30:32.038 --> 30:33.831
I'm off.

30:33.831 --> 30:35.123
Dude.

30:35.124 --> 30:37.251
Soda party in our room?

30:37.251 --> 30:38.835
Ah... You know what, man?

30:38.836 --> 30:40.254
Just... have mine.

30:40.254 --> 30:41.922
1 got somewhere ll gotta be.

30:45.051 --> 30:46.093
Okay.

30:49.472 --> 30:51.640
Law! What did you do to my room?

30:51.640 --> 30:54.267
Our room, Ted!
What did I do to our room?

30:54.268 --> 30:56.478
This isn't your room!
Get... get out!

30:56.479 --> 30:58.272
Oh, don't you like
how it smells now?

30:58.272 --> 30:59.564
That's my pizza!

30:59.565 --> 31:01.775
Oh, I'm so sorry
about your pizza, Ted!

31:01.776 --> 31:03.486
Oh! Oh, my god! My books!

31:03.486 --> 31:05.613
They're ruined!
Look at this place!

31:05.613 --> 31:06.655
Oh, god...!

31:15.414 --> 31:17.874
Oh, um...

31:17.875 --> 31:19.376
Sorry, coach.

31:19.377 --> 31:20.977
Figured I'd get
my own practice in early.

31:29.095 --> 31:32.056
It's whole-grain bagels
and hummus for the team.

31:38.479 --> 31:39.771
Um...

31:39.772 --> 31:42.316
Listen, coach,
about yesterday, I...

31:42.316 --> 31:44.943
I'm sorry. No excuses.

31:48.322 --> 31:49.948
Brian.

31:49.949 --> 31:52.284
Sit your ass down.

31:52.284 --> 31:55.870
<i>Well, actually, I've been awake
for, like, 24 hours.</i>

31:55.871 --> 31:57.414
- Brian!
- Okay.
