01:43.699 --> 01:46.535
- Hey!
- Hi, how are you? Good to see you.

01:50.206 --> 01:51.541
Here he is.

01:53.793 --> 01:55.712
Looks good in there, huh?

01:58.130 --> 01:59.715
Happy birthday, Pa!

02:12.227 --> 02:15.689
Let's move on and put this
in the "no" pile.

02:16.148 --> 02:18.693
Can you tell me your idea
with this one?

02:18.693 --> 02:21.195
Just so I know what the thinking was
behind this.

02:22.280 --> 02:26.408
Romey! Where are you. dude?

02:26.408 --> 02:29.203
It's my brother. He's coming.
Let's put a pin in this one and move on.

02:29.203 --> 02:31.872
Let a thousand sunflowers bloom, Romey.

02:31.872 --> 02:34.793
I wanna start a business with you. brother.

02:34.793 --> 02:40.340
- 'Sup, T?
- This is nothing. No.

02:40.924 --> 02:43.676
- Frank, touch ups?
- Hey, guys! How are we looking?

02:47.721 --> 02:51.392
- No.
- That's a hard no.

02:51.392 --> 02:54.687
In terms of what we need
for our new venture, The Hundred.

02:54.687 --> 02:57.231
- They're...
- They're shitty.

02:57.231 --> 03:00.610
They're shitty.
We can just be honest here, right?

03:00.610 --> 03:03.612
The Hundred is Substack
meets Masterclass

03:03.612 --> 03:05.698
meets The Economist
meets The New Yorker.

03:05.698 --> 03:09.618
I feel like we said "iconic",
and you guys are leaning "ironic".

03:09.618 --> 03:12.622
Hey, T? I think the money is here.

03:13.330 --> 03:16.917
Rome, I think your security
are being very weird with them.

03:16.917 --> 03:19.586
They seem stupid
and probably racist.

03:20.170 --> 03:23.550
Well, you look tired, and your face
is giving me a headache.

03:23.550 --> 03:27.344
- Thank you.
- So, where have you been, sis?

03:27.344 --> 03:29.722
What do you mean? Hey!

03:31.099 --> 03:32.057
Where have you been?

03:32.516 --> 03:36.146
It was traffic. And a call.
Business. For this.

03:36.146 --> 03:38.022
Guys, this is good feedback.

03:38.022 --> 03:40.817
We're gonna circle back on exactly
all that stuff and we'll talk soon.

03:40.817 --> 03:42.861
See you later.

03:42.861 --> 03:44.737
So, traffic?

03:45.864 --> 03:47.824
Yeah, traffic. What?

03:47.824 --> 03:49.868
Shivy, are you snaking?

03:49.868 --> 03:53.412
We hear that you've been talking
to the Jimenez transition team.

03:53.412 --> 03:55.957
- Well, no.
- No?

03:56.540 --> 03:58.084
No.

03:58.084 --> 04:01.671
So it's lies that our friend told us?
They're lying to us?

04:02.171 --> 04:04.548
I've talked to them, but it's because
I'm helping them out,

04:04.548 --> 04:06.050
as you already know.

04:06.050 --> 04:07.843
So you are talking?

04:07.843 --> 04:12.849
No. I returned a call. They wanna
talk about talking.

04:12.849 --> 04:16.477
They wanna talk about talking?

04:16.477 --> 04:20.522
What? Come on. They haven't won
the election, and they might not,

04:20.522 --> 04:22.441
and Dad might not sell,

04:22.441 --> 04:26.363
and you two might bail, and it's
a maybe, maybe, maybe situation.

04:26.363 --> 04:30.116
Dad is obviously selling.
We're looking at fucking logos here.

04:30.116 --> 04:33.036
I drafted a resignation statement
from Waystar.

04:33.036 --> 04:34.953
Same.

04:34.953 --> 04:38.500
This is just a big step, and so,
can't we keep some options?

04:38.500 --> 04:41.586
Keep options open? We're two days out
from Dad selling.

04:41.586 --> 04:45.255
Here's what you have to understand.
I've smoked horse.

04:45.255 --> 04:48.802
He's scared of needles.
He's not a real junkie.

04:48.802 --> 04:54.181
I need something super fucking
absorbing in my life.

04:54.181 --> 04:57.269
And it isn't gonna be this,
please just let me know, right?

04:57.269 --> 04:59.520
I feel like I've been flying
around the country,

04:59.520 --> 05:02.982
having serious fucking conversations
with serious people,

05:02.982 --> 05:04.776
expending serious personal capital

05:04.776 --> 05:06.736
and getting big fucking names
on board.

05:06.736 --> 05:09.446
- Same. Me, too.
- So we've all been doing that.

05:09.446 --> 05:11.741
Are you worried dial this is
maybe too small scale?

05:11.741 --> 05:13.785
What? No. No, do you?

05:13.785 --> 05:18.081
Me? No. My only worry,
is it literally too good?

05:18.081 --> 05:20.208
Like, why hasn't anyone done this
before?

05:20.208 --> 05:21.668
I am in.

05:22.294 --> 05:23.878
I'm in. I am.

05:24.545 --> 05:25.796
Okay.

05:25.796 --> 05:28.967
Happy birthday to you!

05:28.967 --> 05:32.804
Happy birthday, dear Logan!

05:32.804 --> 05:36.850
Happy birthday to you!

05:43.023 --> 05:45.482
Jesus fucking Christ!

05:53.575 --> 05:54.867
You okay, Loge?

05:57.911 --> 06:00.914
Munsters. Meet the fucking Munsters.

06:04.544 --> 06:07.046
Who the fuck is this now?

06:07.755 --> 06:11.216
- So, I guess we should...
- Hi! Welcome!

06:11.216 --> 06:14.345
- Welcome, Greg and...
- This is Bridget.

06:14.345 --> 06:16.680
Bridget, this is Kerry. Logan's...

06:16.680 --> 06:19.308
Friend, assistant, and advisor.

06:19.683 --> 06:22.936
- Hey, I'm Bridget.
- Hi, Bridget. So great to meet you.

06:22.936 --> 06:26.942
Greg, let me and you grab Bridget
a drink.

06:27.316 --> 06:29.068
Okay. So, excuse us, Bridget.

06:29.611 --> 06:34.449
I'm sorry. We'll be right back.
Make yourself at home.

06:34.824 --> 06:36.910
- Who is this, Greg?
- That's my date.

06:36.910 --> 06:38.745
Right, but who is she?

06:39.329 --> 06:41.205
I brought a date. That's okay, right?

06:41.205 --> 06:43.666
What's her name?
What's her full name?

06:43.999 --> 06:46.794
Is it Random-fuck?
Bridget Random-fuck?

06:46.794 --> 06:49.004
Is she from the apps, Greg?

06:49.381 --> 06:52.509
I really like her.
I might have fallen for her.

06:52.509 --> 06:55.469
That's great. How many previous
dates have you had?

06:55.469 --> 06:59.808
Kerry, I'm not sure this is appropriate.

07:00.267 --> 07:02.434
We're not a fucking Shake Shack, Greg.

07:02.978 --> 07:05.855
This isn't a pre-fuck party.
It's a birthday party.

07:08.691 --> 07:11.819
I am a cousin. I get a plus one.

07:12.570 --> 07:14.571
I'm like an honorary kid.

07:14.571 --> 07:16.866
You're an honorary kid?

07:16.866 --> 07:19.368
- Yeah. Marcia once said...
- Marcia's not here.

07:19.368 --> 07:21.996
She's in Milan, shopping. Forever.

07:21.996 --> 07:26.126
You do know that we're in the middle
of a hotly-contested election,

07:26.126 --> 07:28.585
your uncle is on the brink
of a very large sale

07:28.585 --> 07:31.673
and scoping out
a very sensitive acquisition?

07:31.673 --> 07:35.676
Are you certain she's not gonna leak
details before the board meeting?

07:35.676 --> 07:38.638
Do you know she's not
a hostile corporate asset?

07:39.388 --> 07:42.766
So, we're looking for investment partners

07:42.766 --> 07:45.604
for a revolutionary, new
media brand

07:45.604 --> 07:48.106
that's gonna redefine news
for the 21st century.

07:48.106 --> 07:52.234
It's an indispensable, bespoke
information hub.

07:52.234 --> 07:55.029
Then I go: "The Hundred, greatest
experts, best writers,"

07:55.029 --> 07:58.450
"top minds in every field,
from Israel-Palestine to AI"

07:58.450 --> 07:59.908
"to Michelin restaurants."

08:01.535 --> 08:04.538
Sorry. I'm gonna take this.

08:05.581 --> 08:07.166
All right, take it.

08:10.085 --> 08:12.922
- Hello?
- Hey. How are you?

08:12.922 --> 08:15.008
Good. How are you? What is it?

08:15.507 --> 08:18.177
I was just calling
to give you a heads up

08:18.177 --> 08:19.470
and just to say hi,

08:19.470 --> 08:23.266
and just to let you know that I just had
a little drink

08:23.266 --> 08:25.392
with Naomi Pierce last night.

08:25.392 --> 08:29.438
Just in case of anything,
I just wanted to inform you.

08:29.814 --> 08:32.900
I'm sorry, you're informing me?

08:32.900 --> 08:37.404
I just wanted to perform the ask
out of due deference,

08:38.531 --> 08:41.492
just in case of photos
or getting talked about.

08:41.825 --> 08:45.329
I'm sorry, you're asking me
or you're informing me?

08:45.329 --> 08:47.623
Shiv, it's not a thing.

08:48.833 --> 08:50.669
Then why are you letting me know?

08:50.669 --> 08:53.170
Because it's not business.
But it is...

08:54.088 --> 08:56.965
It's fine. You're dating
my brother's ex.

08:56.965 --> 08:58.676
It's fine.

08:58.676 --> 09:04.264
Shiv, no. It's social.
It's not a sexual thing.

09:04.264 --> 09:07.142
So there's nothing
I need to tell you about.

09:08.143 --> 09:09.646
And yet, you're telling me.

09:10.229 --> 09:13.482
Because I bumped into Marlinda, okay?

09:13.482 --> 09:15.151
And of course,
she got her little beak in,

09:15.151 --> 09:17.569
so I had to tell her it wasn't business
because she asked.

09:17.569 --> 09:21.283
So, the headline is there's
nothing to worry about. Okay?

09:21.283 --> 09:23.618
It's fine,
it's all fucking fine.

09:23.618 --> 09:25.119
Seriously. Knock yourself out.

09:25.119 --> 09:27.372
Go fucking nail her in the coat check.
I don't care.

09:27.372 --> 09:28.957
The kid from St. Paul
has really made it.

09:28.957 --> 09:33.420
I just thought this was something
worth discussing.

09:33.420 --> 09:36.798
You don't discuss something, Tom,
that's already fucking happening.

09:36.798 --> 09:38.633
You don't say "Shiv, do you mind,"

09:38.633 --> 09:40.844
"Naomi and I are at the Pierre
and I'm inside her."

09:40.844 --> 09:42.970
- "Would you mind if I ejaculate?"
- Whatever.

09:43.512 --> 09:48.183
Fine. I saw from the calendar update
you're back in the city tonight?

09:48.183 --> 09:52.479
So, why the fuck are you meeting
with her? What's going on?

09:53.189 --> 09:54.315
Take care, Shiv.

10:00.154 --> 10:03.198
It's like a private members' club,
but for everyone.

10:04.199 --> 10:07.120
It is clickbait in a way,
but for smart people.

10:07.120 --> 10:09.914
We have the ethos
of a non-profit,

10:09.914 --> 10:13.834
but a path to crazy margins.
Shiv, you okay?

10:14.294 --> 10:17.379
- Yeah.
- You sure?

10:17.714 --> 10:19.089
It's fine, I'm fine.

10:19.924 --> 10:22.427
Tom's apparently out
with Naomi Pierce.

10:22.427 --> 10:24.220
Did you know about this?

10:25.889 --> 10:28.141
What? No.

10:28.141 --> 10:30.852
- Where are you at with her?
- I don't know.

10:31.560 --> 10:35.856
Like carnival of mind fuck.
We haven't really talked.

10:35.856 --> 10:38.318
Well, apparently she's fucking Tom now.

10:38.318 --> 10:40.403
Can I go get them?

10:40.819 --> 10:43.365
Yeah. I'm fine.
I'm actually fine.

10:43.365 --> 10:45.532
He's not...

10:46.409 --> 10:52.039
It was just a meeting, apparently,
so it's fine. Let's do this.

10:53.749 --> 10:58.837
Yeah? Do you think
they can just give us two?

11:00.090 --> 11:02.716
I mean, it's fine,
but they just got off a long flight.

11:02.716 --> 11:04.886
Tell 'em they can shove
their petrodollars

11:04.886 --> 11:07.389
up their human rights record.
We need to talk to our sister.

11:07.389 --> 11:09.098
They're fine. They love it.

11:09.098 --> 11:12.477
Just find them a journalist to burn
with cigarettes while they wait.

11:16.648 --> 11:19.441
Shiv, is it a date?

11:20.067 --> 11:23.363
I don't know.

11:24.406 --> 11:27.284
It probably isn't, but...

11:28.243 --> 11:33.998
I mean, Naomi Pierce. Dad?

11:35.082 --> 11:36.668
With Dad? You think what?

11:37.335 --> 11:40.755
I got sent this from my team.

11:40.755 --> 11:44.884
Apparently Bun Pierce has been
tagged on some girl's Insta at Dad's.

11:45.342 --> 11:47.220
- At Dad's?
- At the birthday.

11:49.555 --> 11:52.976
Okay. Well, board meeting imminent.

11:53.768 --> 11:56.061
He sells up,
but with ATN spun off?

11:57.522 --> 12:01.818
What? He's lining up a Pierce
acquisition to add

12:01.818 --> 12:03.903
to his little fucking ATM rump?

12:04.528 --> 12:07.781
- I guess.
- Or it could just be a brain fuck.

12:08.617 --> 12:11.620
Dad twisting our turnips,
playing the old fuck trombone.

12:11.620 --> 12:14.163
Set Tom and Nay up to just torture us.

12:14.163 --> 12:16.373
Set them up to torture us?

12:17.416 --> 12:21.379
I mean, he's a sociopath,
but he wouldn't be a good torturer.

12:21.379 --> 12:23.255
Not 'cause he doesn't have
the stomach,

12:23.255 --> 12:25.257
he just doesn't have the patience.

12:25.257 --> 12:26.800
I'm gonna call Nay.

12:27.718 --> 12:29.220
- Telly?
- Yeah?

12:29.220 --> 12:32.431
Telly, jelly, belly, one query.

12:33.016 --> 12:37.353
Pierce, PGN. What's the vibes,
YOLO, rumbatron?

12:37.353 --> 12:38.520
Are they in play?

12:38.520 --> 12:41.107
I know they're always open to offers

12:41.107 --> 12:43.734
and the sale contingent
on the trust is itchy, I believe.

12:44.526 --> 12:46.279
Should I call Nabby through?

12:48.615 --> 12:51.283
Five more. Please. Just give us five.

12:51.283 --> 12:52.953
Okay, yeah.

12:59.042 --> 13:01.585
Hey. You okay, Con?

13:01.585 --> 13:04.506
Yeah. Just polling.

13:07.425 --> 13:10.594
- Ten days out...
- What are you at now?

13:10.594 --> 13:13.390
- Solid. Still holding.
- Yeah, one percent.

13:13.390 --> 13:18.435
The fear is in these last days,
it could get squeezed.

13:18.435 --> 13:20.021
Squeezed down?

13:20.646 --> 13:23.107
From one?
'Cause that's the lowest number.

13:23.107 --> 13:25.151
No. There's decimals.

13:25.151 --> 13:27.945
They're saying that I could need
to get aggressive

13:27.945 --> 13:29.281
in certain media markets

13:29.281 --> 13:32.284
because both sides are trying
to squeeze my percent.

13:32.284 --> 13:35.619
That's greedy, knowing they have
all the other percents.

13:35.619 --> 13:38.998
But it gets awfully spendy
to get aggressive.

13:39.373 --> 13:40.750
Like, how much?

13:41.668 --> 13:44.086
Like another hundred mil.

13:44.086 --> 13:47.339
One hundred million? Damn!

13:48.674 --> 13:51.344
So, what would you get for that?
Could you win?

13:51.344 --> 13:52.803
Good Lord, no.

13:52.803 --> 13:56.641
No. That won't move the needle.

13:56.641 --> 13:59.852
The hope is that would maintain
my percent.

13:59.852 --> 14:02.062
And for your percent you get...?

14:02.062 --> 14:03.647
A place in the conversation.

14:03.647 --> 14:06.775
Which is great, 'cause conversation's
important to be inside of.

14:07.401 --> 14:10.571
But it is kind of a lot.
Right, Will?

14:10.571 --> 14:14.867
A hundred million?
Yeah.

14:15.743 --> 14:21.248
But if you spent it,
you'd still be like rich.

14:21.248 --> 14:23.126
Sure, yeah.

14:24.836 --> 14:28.840
Nevertheless, like,
minus a hundred million.

14:30.175 --> 14:32.510
When it comes to this new venture
with GoJo,

14:32.510 --> 14:35.429
and if you talk to Matsson,
consider it.

14:36.472 --> 14:38.182
Right. Thank you.

14:41.310 --> 14:42.520
So...

14:45.105 --> 14:47.108
- Looks good.
- We squared away on this?

14:47.108 --> 14:49.526
Got the structure,
got the landing zone.

14:49.526 --> 14:52.237
Naomi thinks that Nan has lost
all interest in business.

14:52.237 --> 14:54.532
The left are going after them now.

14:54.908 --> 14:56.825
Savages. They eat their own.

14:56.825 --> 15:01.246
The cousins want out. So, I think,
a last push on price maybe...

15:01.246 --> 15:03.999
Little tummy tickle on culture.

15:03.999 --> 15:06.585
And Naomi's flown out to reassure.

15:07.087 --> 15:10.465
This is it. You landed the plane, Logan.

15:11.257 --> 15:14.301
48 hours and out.
Congratulations!

15:19.182 --> 15:21.810
Have you heard from the rats?

15:22.393 --> 15:25.313
Shiv? No.

15:26.689 --> 15:28.149
Good.

15:29.775 --> 15:31.820
One thing has been
on my mind though, sir.

15:32.988 --> 15:34.531
Yes.

15:36.699 --> 15:41.329
With one thing and another,
I'm sure we'll iron it all out,

15:41.329 --> 15:44.415
but the rocky, old road of life,

15:45.792 --> 15:51.547
and the wife part of that can be
a difficult part of it.

15:52.173 --> 15:53.507
As you know.

15:54.342 --> 15:59.222
Not to comment, just to say it would
be great to get your take.

15:59.222 --> 16:01.933
Hopefully, it won't come to that, but...

16:02.684 --> 16:06.812
In the end, if there is just
too much emotional shrapnel...

16:06.812 --> 16:09.899
I wondered what your view would be.

16:09.899 --> 16:12.068
Not that you necessarily
need to have one,

16:13.193 --> 16:17.449
but what would happen
were a marriage, such as mine,

16:17.449 --> 16:19.992
even in fact mine,

16:19.992 --> 16:23.245
if that were to falter
to the point of failure?

16:23.245 --> 16:26.373
- If you and Shiv were to bust up?
- Right.

16:29.669 --> 16:33.547
I guess, Shiv and I have had
this experiment,

16:33.547 --> 16:34.883
this trial separation,

16:34.883 --> 16:40.846
but whatever happens,
we'll always be good, right?

16:41.181 --> 16:43.475
If we're good, we're good.

16:44.350 --> 16:47.227
Okay. Well, that's heartening.

16:47.770 --> 16:49.356
That's heartening.

16:49.356 --> 16:51.441
I'm heartened by that.
That's great.

16:51.441 --> 16:53.984
Kerry! Where's the grub?

16:55.402 --> 16:57.072
Tom's going off his nut here.

17:06.538 --> 17:09.834
So, you two are thinking we should
be buying Pierce, huh?

17:10.918 --> 17:15.465
Because that's obviously what
you're thinking, and let me just say,

17:15.465 --> 17:17.466
that's quite the fucking pivot!

17:17.801 --> 17:22.055
Right. You may be thinking,
"What about The Hundred?"

17:22.429 --> 17:24.307
Maybe, fuck The Hundred?

17:24.307 --> 17:25.808
Fuck The Hundred, Shiv?

17:25.808 --> 17:28.478
After Dubai, you were high as shit
on it. It was basically your idea.

17:28.478 --> 17:30.521
- I love it. I do.
- You do?

17:30.521 --> 17:32.232
Yes, but can't we do both?

17:32.232 --> 17:33.692
Can't we do both?

17:33.692 --> 17:37.070
Let's launch a high-visibility
execution-dependent

17:37.070 --> 17:38.488
disruptor news brand

17:38.488 --> 17:41.073
while simultaneously performing CPR
on a fucking corpse

17:41.073 --> 17:42.741
of a legacy media conglomerate.

17:42.741 --> 17:43.909
Should we ask Tellis?

17:43.909 --> 17:45.995
Yes. Let's ask Tellis.
I wonder what he's gonna say.

17:45.995 --> 17:48.998
"Hey, Telly. Would you rather five
million in fees from a funding round"

17:48.998 --> 17:50.709
"or 35 million from an acquisition?"

17:51.959 --> 17:54.003
I thought we were going
for The Hundred.

17:54.003 --> 17:55.964
Small, new, fast on our feet.

17:55.964 --> 17:59.174
- Are you scared of fighting Dad?
- No, Ken.

17:59.174 --> 18:00.677
That's getting fucking old.

18:00.677 --> 18:04.514
You spent the last three months hunting
down contributors, backers, right?

18:04.514 --> 18:06.724
- Working your fucking ass off.
- I don't have a view.

18:06.724 --> 18:09.978
All I would say is, maybe it's worth
the conversation, all right?

18:09.978 --> 18:11.228
It is our wheelhouse.

18:11.228 --> 18:14.399
It's a Daimler that's been in the barn
for 20 years.

18:14.399 --> 18:17.484
Clear the chicken shit
off that thing, fucking maybe.

18:17.484 --> 18:20.405
Okay. But can we even afford it?

18:21.781 --> 18:24.576
Okay. It's halved now?

18:24.576 --> 18:26.285
So that's, like, eight, nine bil.

18:26.703 --> 18:30.539
And after the GoJo sale,
we'll have 2-3 bil.

18:30.539 --> 18:33.042
So, yeah, that's our nut.

18:33.834 --> 18:37.463
If we partner up with our name
with these fucks here,

18:37.463 --> 18:40.632
some other pieces of shit,
our experience,

18:40.632 --> 18:42.968
Shiv the yummy dummy Demmy,

18:42.968 --> 18:45.304
my profile as the fearless fighter
of the good fight,

18:45.304 --> 18:48.265
you as the dirty little fucker
pushing the filth buttons.

18:48.265 --> 18:53.605
Yeah, new gen Roys.
We have a fucking song to sing.

18:53.605 --> 18:56.441
I mean, as a business
it's much better

18:56.441 --> 18:58.400
than the made-up company of dreams
we were ready to pitch.

18:58.400 --> 19:00.070
Fuck you!
You loved it!

19:00.070 --> 19:04.282
I do. It's very exciting.
But it's kinda bullshit.

19:04.907 --> 19:08.620
Rome, it is.
I wanna do something.

19:08.620 --> 19:10.829
We have a seminal election
about to happen,

19:10.829 --> 19:13.999
and it's fucking 1933,
and I wanna have a say.

19:15.210 --> 19:18.630
It makes sense, Rome, to start
an empire with an established brand.

19:20.131 --> 19:22.132
At least rule it out.

19:25.761 --> 19:27.846
Disgustibus!

19:30.100 --> 19:32.559
I hear you've made
an enormous faux pas,

19:32.559 --> 19:35.021
and everyone's laughing up
their sleeves about your date.

19:35.021 --> 19:36.856
What? Why?

19:37.607 --> 19:42.237
Why? Because she's brought
a ludicrously capacious bag.

19:42.237 --> 19:46.907
What's even in there?
Flat shoes for the subway?

19:46.907 --> 19:49.201
Her lunch pail?
Greg, it's monstrous.

19:49.201 --> 19:52.455
It's gargantuan.
You could take it camping.

19:52.455 --> 19:54.749
You could slide it
across the floor after a bank job.

19:54.749 --> 19:57.711
Well, whatever. She's another tick
on the chart.

19:59.796 --> 20:02.173
The Disgusting Brothers.

20:02.173 --> 20:06.677
Don't call us that.
It was heavily ironized, Greg.

20:08.054 --> 20:10.390
Okay. I'm kidding.
I really do like her.

20:12.309 --> 20:15.937
Well, she's used all the display
towels in the bathroom

20:15.937 --> 20:17.563
and now they're sopping wet.

20:17.563 --> 20:20.942
She's gabbling about herself
and posting it on social media.

20:20.942 --> 20:22.736
She's asking people personal questions

20:22.736 --> 20:27.157
and she's wolfing all the canapes
like a famished warthog.

20:27.157 --> 20:32.161
People are overreacting.
She brought a normal sort of handbag.

20:32.161 --> 20:34.538
You are a laughingstock
in polite society.

20:34.538 --> 20:38.084
- You'll never go to the opera again.
- Maybe we should go.

20:38.084 --> 20:40.794
Are you okay?
What happened?

20:40.794 --> 20:43.630
Nothing. I just asked Logan
for a selfie.

20:45.799 --> 20:47.801
- You asked Logan for a selfie?
- Yeah.

20:47.801 --> 20:49.470
I said "congrats on the big deal".

20:49.470 --> 20:53.475
I was like "kar-ching", am I right?"
I was being funny.

20:55.268 --> 20:57.062
So I'm in touch with their bankers.

20:57.062 --> 20:59.855
Nan thinks she's honor bound
to another buyer.

21:01.649 --> 21:03.568
- Did she say no?
- No.

21:04.194 --> 21:06.612
But they're close to agreeing
the outlines of a deal.

21:06.988 --> 21:09.616
There's not a ton of interest,
managing the family's a nightmare,

21:09.616 --> 21:12.494
so they're looking for a preferred
bidder to run a bilateral.

21:13.286 --> 21:15.788
She wants to lock in that preferred
bidder tonight.

21:15.788 --> 21:20.043
So, she didn't think it could work.
But she did say

21:20.043 --> 21:22.087
she could speak to you, Shiv.

21:25.881 --> 21:28.593
Okay. Well, should I at least call?

21:28.593 --> 21:30.636
Just check in at Grey Gardens

21:30.636 --> 21:34.306
and go mano a Nan-o to see
if there's anything there at all?

21:34.306 --> 21:35.766
Work your magic.

21:41.855 --> 21:44.526
You good?
It's nice, huh?

21:44.526 --> 21:47.153
Yeah. Little piggies stuffing
their mouths.

21:48.070 --> 21:50.906
Why is everybody
so fucking happy?

21:51.283 --> 21:52.659
Logan...

21:54.034 --> 21:55.745
- You okay?
- Yeah.

21:56.288 --> 21:59.457
I got done a huge fucking deal
in exactly the right time.

21:59.457 --> 22:02.252
I got ATN, plus Pierce.

22:02.794 --> 22:06.423
I got the election.
I got plenty on my plate.

22:06.423 --> 22:08.258
Sure.

22:08.258 --> 22:11.301
I thought there might be
a churchman.

22:12.261 --> 22:13.805
I'm sorry?

22:13.805 --> 22:16.891
A cardinal was mentioned.
Bit of fucking class.

22:18.226 --> 22:19.477
What about Jeryd?

22:20.812 --> 22:24.232
Mencken? I think that he hopes to,
but realistically...

22:24.232 --> 22:27.651
But I think that he hopes to.
But Jillian is here.

22:30.989 --> 22:33.533
Do you want me to be in touch
with the kids?

22:36.535 --> 22:38.078
When is she calling?

22:38.078 --> 22:41.540
I think she just wants to talk
to her whole gang.

22:41.540 --> 22:45.086
Listen, I'm not gonna sit
like a cunt,

22:45.086 --> 22:47.046
waiting for that old crone.

22:56.181 --> 22:57.973
The man of the hour!

23:01.728 --> 23:03.021
Colin!

23:10.528 --> 23:13.614
- You all right?
- Yeah. Let's get out of here.

23:16.492 --> 23:19.412
So it is Dad. Confirmed.

23:20.789 --> 23:23.165
Yeah. She's a complicated woman.

23:23.165 --> 23:26.335
"I'm honor bound,
my mind is made up,"

23:26.335 --> 23:28.462
"but also,
how soon can we be there?"

23:28.462 --> 23:30.547
- Fuck her!
- What do you think?

23:31.132 --> 23:32.841
I think she hates Dad.

23:33.384 --> 23:37.596
But also thinks we're fake fruit
for display purposes only.

23:37.596 --> 23:39.266
I don't know.

23:39.266 --> 23:41.393
Can we tell her to fuck off?

23:41.393 --> 23:43.811
Maybe not go back to the mat
with Dad.

23:43.811 --> 23:46.146
You know, back
in that fucking room...

23:46.146 --> 23:49.066
- Shall we cards on the table?
- Yeah.

23:49.066 --> 23:53.655
- I do like Pierce.
- Agreed.

23:54.656 --> 23:57.408
- Fuck's sake!
- Rome, it makes sense.

23:57.408 --> 24:00.244
We wanted to do something together,
and we know news, entertainment,

24:00.244 --> 24:02.247
and this is off the shelf.

24:02.247 --> 24:05.416
So, I guess until now, you've just sort
of been stringing us along?

24:05.416 --> 24:07.877
No. I like the other shit, I do.

24:07.877 --> 24:11.298
I like this, I really do.

24:11.298 --> 24:13.590
And besides, everything else
might fall apart.

24:13.590 --> 24:15.342
He might go on a killing spree
in 7-Eleven,

24:15.342 --> 24:17.554
and you might get your dick stuck
in an AI jerk machine.

24:17.554 --> 24:20.306
I have to look after myself
because nobody else will.

24:20.306 --> 24:21.640
I like this.

24:21.640 --> 24:23.392
So, you wanna fly there,

24:23.392 --> 24:27.563
like Nan Pierce's little
Windsor Dog Show bitch?

24:27.563 --> 24:29.608
- It's just a checkout.
- Yeah.

24:30.609 --> 24:31.901
Fuck! Shit!

24:31.901 --> 24:34.487
I'm worried, I guess.

24:34.487 --> 24:37.781
Like you wanna fuck Dad.
You wanna fuck Tom.

24:37.781 --> 24:40.285
I'm the only one who wants to set up
a business as a business

24:40.285 --> 24:41.744
and doesn't wanna fuck anyone.

24:41.744 --> 24:44.956
Rome, this acquisition would be
nothing to do with Dad.

24:44.956 --> 24:46.874
- It's completely unrelated.
- Don't believe you.

24:46.874 --> 24:49.586
- Seriously.
- Seriously don't believe you.

24:49.586 --> 24:52.547
Okay, well, this is not about
getting back at Dad.

24:52.547 --> 24:55.799
but if it hurts him.
it doesn't bother me.

24:55.799 --> 24:58.886
I think that you don't wanna do this
'cause you're scared of conflict.

24:59.386 --> 25:01.932
Honestly, Rome,
being rational,

25:02.306 --> 25:05.643
putting aside the internecine
family concerns,

25:05.643 --> 25:07.062
the personal tittle tattle,

25:07.062 --> 25:10.023
just think about how fucking funny it
would be if we screw Dad

25:10.023 --> 25:11.899
over his decades-long
obsession.

25:35.381 --> 25:36.965
You're a good guy.

25:37.966 --> 25:40.929
- Thank you, sir.
- You're my pal.

25:42.847 --> 25:44.223
Thank you.

25:45.766 --> 25:48.477
- You're my best pal.
- Thank you.

25:50.813 --> 25:53.941
I mean, what are people?

25:54.942 --> 25:56.193
Right.

25:56.986 --> 25:58.780
What are people?

26:01.616 --> 26:05.453
They're economic units.
I'm a hundred feet tall.

26:06.246 --> 26:07.663
These people are pygmies.

26:08.247 --> 26:12.960
But together,
they form a market.

26:12.960 --> 26:14.671
Okay. Right.

26:15.422 --> 26:18.882
What is a person?
It has values and aims,

26:19.634 --> 26:21.636
but it operates in a market.

26:22.637 --> 26:25.681
Marriage market, job market,

26:26.015 --> 26:30.020
money market, market for ideas,
et cetera.

26:34.356 --> 26:36.692
So, everything is a market?

26:37.651 --> 26:40.363
Everything I try to do
people turn against me.

26:42.656 --> 26:44.868
Nothing tastes like it used to,
does it?

26:44.868 --> 26:47.036
Nothing is the same as it was.

26:55.711 --> 26:59.966
You think there's anything
after all this? Afterwards?

27:02.344 --> 27:03.761
I don't know.

27:03.761 --> 27:08.808
I don't think so.
I think this is it, right?

27:09.559 --> 27:10.809
Maybe.

27:12.144 --> 27:14.229
My Dad is very religious...

27:14.229 --> 27:15.899
But realistically though?

27:16.983 --> 27:19.151
- I don't know.
- And that's it.

27:21.278 --> 27:24.950
We don't know.
We can't know.

27:27.785 --> 27:29.620
But I've got my suspicions.

27:31.498 --> 27:34.208
I've got my fucking suspicions.

27:36.252 --> 27:38.296
Lookie here! Pardon me!

27:38.296 --> 27:40.506
Hello, Kerry!
And how are we today?

27:40.506 --> 27:44.218
Hi! Can you hear me?
The line is a little bit...

27:44.218 --> 27:47.430
Sort of. We're in transit.
Can you hear me?

27:47.430 --> 27:50.308
You'd be able to hear her better if she
took Dad's cock out of her mouth.

27:50.308 --> 27:51.475
What's that?

27:51.475 --> 27:53.769
That was my sister saying
that we would hear you better

27:53.769 --> 27:55.981
if you took Dad's cock
out of your mouth.

27:57.524 --> 28:01.652
So. my question was,
would you consider giving him a call?

28:02.237 --> 28:04.656
Would we consider at least a call?

28:07.658 --> 28:09.327
Well, is he apologizing?

28:09.327 --> 28:11.454
Did he ask?

28:12.621 --> 28:14.332
Did he ask?

28:14.332 --> 28:16.584
He...

28:17.335 --> 28:20.046
I know that he would love
to hear from you.

28:20.046 --> 28:23.967
If he were to call,
then we would see.

28:23.967 --> 28:27.219
It's just gonna be a lot to get him
to call, just knowing him.

28:27.219 --> 28:30.264
I think we know him
pretty well, actually.

28:30.264 --> 28:32.726
We've never licked
his big omelet nipples.

28:32.726 --> 28:36.854
I could get him to text
a request for a call.

28:36.854 --> 28:40.774
Text? I'm afraid we're gonna need
to hear that voice.

28:40.774 --> 28:44.029
You can pop it back in your mouth.
We're getting on the plane.

28:44.029 --> 28:45.280
Thanks, bye.

28:46.196 --> 28:48.199
- Dick.
- Problem.

28:48.199 --> 28:51.410
He's not picking up for me.
He pick up for you?

28:59.293 --> 29:00.962
Hey!

29:11.890 --> 29:13.265
Hey!

29:14.558 --> 29:18.688
Will. I'm sorry.
Can I get through?

29:19.689 --> 29:21.733
Hey, baby!

29:24.276 --> 29:26.862
Listen. So, you know the wedding.

29:27.822 --> 29:29.531
I've been thinking...

29:30.659 --> 29:31.910
About?

29:32.744 --> 29:36.122
Is the boat special enough?
Like, brainstorming...

29:36.122 --> 29:40.668
What if we got married underneath
the Statue of Liberty with a brass band?

29:42.128 --> 29:46.382
Get a rapper.
I don't know, jet packs,

29:46.382 --> 29:48.967
confetti guns, and razor wire

29:48.967 --> 29:51.637
and bum fights,
and, you know, goody bags.

29:51.637 --> 29:54.432
- And hoopla and razzmatazz.
- Bum fights?

29:54.432 --> 29:57.519
Con, you sound unhinged.
What is this?

29:57.519 --> 30:00.939
If I can get inserted
into the news cycle,

30:01.480 --> 30:03.817
that's a huge savings
from paid media.

30:04.900 --> 30:09.154
Right.
The wedding...

30:10.614 --> 30:14.785
I've always... It's dumb,
but I wanted a nice wedding.

30:15.661 --> 30:17.580
I'm scared, Willa.

30:17.580 --> 30:21.459
I have spent so much fucking money
and it's getting scary.

30:21.459 --> 30:25.088
If I was to fall under 1%,
I would become a laughing stock.

30:29.967 --> 30:35.599
Would you just consider it?
Just a little bit of hoopla?

30:35.599 --> 30:37.892
Just for the final push.

30:44.523 --> 30:45.692
Hey, hey, hey!

30:46.066 --> 30:47.985
Kerry said she knows
where he is.

30:47.985 --> 30:50.905
He's coming back now.
What are you smiling for?

30:51.740 --> 30:53.033
Nothing.

30:54.034 --> 30:55.410
What?

30:55.952 --> 31:00.706
The Disgusting Brothers
on motherfucking tour.

31:02.833 --> 31:05.669
- We just did it.
- What do you mean you did it?

31:07.422 --> 31:11.133
She's a firecracker, man.
She's crunchy peanut butter.

31:11.760 --> 31:15.304
Wait. You did it?
Are you serious? Where?

31:15.804 --> 31:21.394
We were looking for the armory
slash-cigar-humidor

31:22.187 --> 31:24.356
and she pulled me
into a guest bedroom

31:24.356 --> 31:26.191
and bingo-bongo hit that bango.

31:26.191 --> 31:30.862
You actually did it? Greg...

31:31.655 --> 31:32.988
You are fucked.

31:34.491 --> 31:35.866
You're fucked.

31:39.704 --> 31:44.084
Logan, he's camera'ed up the wazoo. CCTV.

31:45.501 --> 31:48.088
- Which room?
- Every room. You know that.

31:48.088 --> 31:50.382
I evidently did not know that.

31:58.723 --> 32:01.101
- Are you serious?
- Of course.

32:02.102 --> 32:05.312
And he watches it back every night
with a scotch.

32:05.312 --> 32:07.940
See if anyone's stolen
a butter knife.

32:07.940 --> 32:10.944
He's gonna fucking gut you
like a rainbow trout.

32:10.944 --> 32:12.361
Fuck!

32:12.361 --> 32:15.865
What did you do?
Were the lights on?

32:15.865 --> 32:19.577
Did you actually do it?
Tell me.

32:24.541 --> 32:26.918
We put our hands
down each other's pants.

32:27.543 --> 32:30.839
And had a bit of a rummage.

32:31.672 --> 32:33.883
Did you rummage to fruition?

32:35.551 --> 32:37.053
Can I not say?

32:37.053 --> 32:39.931
You've accidentally made him
a sex tape, Greg.

32:41.849 --> 32:43.976
- Oh my God!
- You need to tell him.

32:45.978 --> 32:49.648
Okay, party's over.
Rival bid, let's go!

32:50.275 --> 32:55.154
Tom, Gerri, Karl, Frank,
upstairs, library.

32:55.864 --> 32:57.239
Let's flush it out.

33:34.485 --> 33:36.988
Would you mind just giving me a sec?

33:36.988 --> 33:38.697
Okay. Sure.

33:40.867 --> 33:43.286
- Hey.
- Hey.

33:44.746 --> 33:46.164
Hi!

33:46.747 --> 33:47.874
Hi!

33:51.378 --> 33:58.593
So she's having a little wobble.

33:59.551 --> 34:01.095
Nan? What do you mean?

34:01.554 --> 34:08.019
She's not sure it feels right to meet
you guys. But she feels terrible.

34:08.644 --> 34:13.357
Okay. So, what do we do?

34:13.357 --> 34:16.485
She might be getting a headache.

34:17.195 --> 34:22.241
She wondered if you could give her
five, see how it develops.

34:25.285 --> 34:27.454
Okay, sure.

34:27.872 --> 34:32.167
Let's see how the headache develops.

34:33.627 --> 34:35.504
Okay, Jesus.

34:36.296 --> 34:40.217
So, who's crawled
out of the woodwork?

34:41.301 --> 34:42.344
Who is it?

34:44.096 --> 34:46.850
- What?
- The kids are with the Pierces.

34:46.850 --> 34:51.813
They are the rival bidders?
Butter my beanpole.

34:51.813 --> 34:53.565
How did they pick up the scent?

34:53.565 --> 34:56.650
A million ways. Everybody knows
they're looking for suitors.

34:58.235 --> 35:02.156
Could they even get the cash together?
Couldn't Logan stop them?

35:02.156 --> 35:06.285
If Waystar is sold, they have the right
to liquidate their five percents.

35:06.285 --> 35:09.955
- You should probably tell him.
- I'm very focused on the GoJo deal.

35:09.955 --> 35:11.833
This is a side issue.

35:11.833 --> 35:14.502
- You're such a trusted advisor.
- Yeah, but I'm getting out.

35:14.502 --> 35:17.547
I don't know what the news is,
and it's beyond my purview,

35:17.547 --> 35:19.215
and I'm walking away.

35:19.215 --> 35:22.134
- Beware the blood sugar.
- Well, fucking find out!

35:29.224 --> 35:32.645
- Sir, if I may have a moment.
- What? What's the issue?

35:34.396 --> 35:37.066
The rival bidder,
it's probably the kids.

35:38.567 --> 35:41.737
I don't think you have anything
to be concerned about.

35:41.737 --> 35:44.032
You are the solid option.

35:49.495 --> 35:50.830
Call your wife, Tom.

35:51.246 --> 35:56.753
Call your fucking wife and tell them
to get their own fucking idea.

35:57.087 --> 35:58.296
It's pathetic!

35:58.672 --> 36:04.386
And tell her she's never had a single
fucking idea in her entire life!

36:08.139 --> 36:10.725
- What?
- No, it can wait.

36:10.725 --> 36:11.810
What else?

36:13.060 --> 36:15.897
It's private.
Can you and I just have a moment?

36:15.897 --> 36:17.773
- Over there.
- Thank you. sir.

36:18.732 --> 36:22.320
You think she's just cooling us off?
Doing a Dad move?

36:23.028 --> 36:25.865
No, no. Poor thing has a headache.

36:25.865 --> 36:32.371
So, she's feeling a little better.
If you like, she will see you.

36:32.371 --> 36:36.417
Get to talk to an old lady about
newspapers. Thank you so much.

36:39.963 --> 36:41.296
So how did it go?

36:42.590 --> 36:45.760
So, he says he finds me disgusting
and despicable,

36:46.594 --> 36:48.263
but he kind of smiled.

36:49.638 --> 36:51.140
- Did he?
- Yeah.

36:51.933 --> 36:53.142
What did you say?

36:53.142 --> 36:56.312
So, I said she's a bit wild.

36:56.312 --> 36:58.148
She's quite eager

36:58.148 --> 37:01.901
and maybe she'd had a hit
of the old wacky tabacky or worse.

37:02.986 --> 37:05.530
And that I never intended to soil
these halls.

37:05.530 --> 37:07.449
And maybe she's just a bit of a...

37:07.449 --> 37:11.410
Bit of a drug-addled, cock monster.
So, you blamed it on her.

37:13.037 --> 37:14.621
You're so gallant.

37:15.080 --> 37:18.208
She's gonna have to leave, okay?

37:18.208 --> 37:22.130
Is that really necessary?

37:22.838 --> 37:25.632
- Do you have an issue with that?
- No, look.

37:26.968 --> 37:31.598
Colin, I'm fond of her,
but we must do as we see fit.

37:33.307 --> 37:34.975
She posted to social media.

37:34.975 --> 37:36.977
I'm gonna have to ask to go through
her phone.

37:36.977 --> 37:38.979
You wanna come explain?

37:38.979 --> 37:41.774
Wait, sorry. You know what?

37:42.775 --> 37:46.487
I think it is best if you go do
what you have to do.

37:46.487 --> 37:49.366
I don't wanna see what happens
in Guantanamo.

37:50.032 --> 37:53.118
So you go, do your ways,
and God be willing.

37:55.245 --> 37:58.332
Well, hello! Welcome!

37:58.332 --> 38:02.420
Apologies for the kerfuffle.
I have an appalling migraine.

38:03.380 --> 38:06.632
But I can manage.
How are you all?

38:06.632 --> 38:09.301
- Great.
- Great to see you.

38:09.301 --> 38:11.596
And it's a lovely place.

38:12.346 --> 38:16.100
If would seem that they shred
hundred-dollar notes for fertilizer.

38:17.601 --> 38:21.106
Now, how are you all fairing
in terms of your father?

38:21.106 --> 38:25.777
We're fine. It's just a complicated,
private situation.

38:25.777 --> 38:27.779
Whereby we all hate him.

38:28.780 --> 38:31.074
Well, please sit.

38:32.993 --> 38:39.332
Look, as you probably know,
we are talking with our bankers.

38:39.332 --> 38:44.211
And we have a whole number of
very interesting proposals to consider.

38:44.211 --> 38:47.090
And I think it's all wrapped up.

38:48.049 --> 38:51.468
So, I wanted to say thank you
for coming,

38:52.511 --> 38:54.680
but I think it's just
a little bit too late.

38:54.680 --> 38:56.223
We have a preferred bidder.

38:56.223 --> 38:59.310
I hope that I have not
inconvenienced you.

39:00.145 --> 39:03.273
Okay, well, lovely visit.
Great to see you guys.

39:03.273 --> 39:06.526
Really. I am very sorry.

39:06.526 --> 39:08.445
May I offer you some bottles?

39:08.861 --> 39:11.197
They might as well be jars of jam
to me,

39:11.197 --> 39:13.658
but the connoisseurs seem
to like them.

39:13.658 --> 39:16.328
I fear I have peasant tastes.

39:16.328 --> 39:17.996
You don't wanna just hear the offer?

39:17.996 --> 39:21.124
I got a taste for hypermarché
vin ordinaire

39:21.124 --> 39:24.835
when I was 19 years old and I have
never been able to shake it.

39:25.502 --> 39:28.340
I like my wine thin and vinegary.

39:28.340 --> 39:31.051
- Like her men.
- Naomi!

39:31.051 --> 39:34.428
No, but really I fear it is a trip made
in vain.

39:34.428 --> 39:35.846
The other offer's just too good.

39:35.846 --> 39:38.850
Listen, long story short, Nan,
you called this right before.

39:40.727 --> 39:43.187
Logan wants to take your company
and fuck it.

39:44.064 --> 39:45.189
He loathes you

39:45.189 --> 39:48.400
and he wants to take your properties
and roll them in the dirt.

39:48.984 --> 39:50.361
And we wouldn't do that.

39:50.361 --> 39:52.446
I think that after this election,

39:52.446 --> 39:56.659
we all, as a country, could be
in a very bad place.

39:57.326 --> 40:00.371
We would maintain your values.

40:00.996 --> 40:04.334
That's all good and well, but obviously,
with one thing and another,

40:04.918 --> 40:08.295
we have a responsibility to get
the best possible deal for my family

40:08.295 --> 40:09.672
and the other shareholders.

40:09.672 --> 40:11.840
I'm confident that we can be
competitive on price.

40:11.840 --> 40:15.845
What with Jamie's divorce
and Anne's disaster in Maine...

40:15.845 --> 40:17.471
And this place...

40:19.516 --> 40:23.186
How's your financing?
Not that I understand at all.

40:23.186 --> 40:24.521
It's robust.

40:24.521 --> 40:27.523
Tellis and our team can talk
to your people.

40:27.523 --> 40:29.359
And in terms of your futures?

40:29.359 --> 40:31.444
We've written our resignation letters

40:31.444 --> 40:34.114
and the GoJo deal signs
in 48 hours.

40:34.114 --> 40:37.449
You'd still be married
to the head of ATN.

40:37.449 --> 40:39.952
- That's a bit messy.
- I'm getting a divorce.

40:39.952 --> 40:43.163
Okay. I'm sorry to hear that.

40:43.163 --> 40:46.084
It's a sad, sad day
when love dies.

40:48.712 --> 40:51.964
Listen, this is very confusing.

40:53.300 --> 40:56.719
And I don't want to talk numbers.
It's not about the numbers.

40:56.719 --> 40:57.929
Totally.

40:57.929 --> 41:04.144
Shall we just say our number, just see
if that makes any sense?

41:04.144 --> 41:05.729
I don't like this.

41:07.897 --> 41:10.609
Makes me feel like I'm in the middle
of a bidding war.

41:11.610 --> 41:13.028
Horrible.

41:13.028 --> 41:18.867
Different people saying different
numbers. Eight, nine. What's next?

41:19.284 --> 41:24.288
It's so confusing. What comes
after nine? Nine B?

41:25.956 --> 41:30.378
Would you mind if we all had
a brief chat?

41:31.086 --> 41:34.466
Have you seen the view from
the terrace? It's incredible.

41:34.466 --> 41:37.343
- Can't beat it.
- We'll try.

41:38.261 --> 41:39.553
Thank you.

41:42.307 --> 41:47.938
Nan is thinking, and she wondered
if she could ask for your indulgence.

41:47.938 --> 41:49.481
It's not a money question.

41:50.106 --> 41:53.693
So, you okay to hold on for a minute
just before you talk to her?

41:53.693 --> 41:55.653
Well, what else can I fucking say?

41:56.570 --> 41:59.782
Hi. Yeah. We'll hold.

42:07.164 --> 42:11.752
Nobody tells jokes anymore, do they?
Karl, do you have any jokes?

42:12.128 --> 42:13.420
What's that?

42:14.047 --> 42:20.010
I'm saying, Karl,
it's a bit dry in here.

42:20.010 --> 42:22.555
Do you have any jokes?

42:24.975 --> 42:29.478
- Let me think.
- Dry as fucking dust. Come on!

42:29.478 --> 42:32.816
Roast me!
Give me a drubbing!

42:33.441 --> 42:35.402
Frank, start. Be funny!

42:36.819 --> 42:38.237
It's not really my thing, Chief.

42:38.738 --> 42:41.116
You don't think I can take it?

42:41.116 --> 42:44.118
No, it's just not my style.
I mean, I can.

42:45.954 --> 42:48.247
The thing about Logan Roy is...

42:48.247 --> 42:52.835
The thing about Logan is
he's a tough old nut.

42:56.005 --> 42:59.342
Christ. Sid fucking Caesar. Greggy.

43:00.134 --> 43:03.221
You're mean.
You're a mean, old man.

43:03.221 --> 43:08.017
You're a mean, old bastard,
and you scare the life out of folks.

43:08.017 --> 43:10.060
That's your thing.
You're scaring me right now.

43:10.060 --> 43:13.188
And that's why I don't
even know what to do.

43:13.188 --> 43:15.858
Who wants to smell Greg's finger?

43:16.984 --> 43:19.821
Guess the scent, win a buck.

43:21.030 --> 43:23.699
Come on! Roast me!

43:23.699 --> 43:27.120
Where's all your kids,
uncle Logan?

43:27.120 --> 43:29.955
- On your big birthday.
- Where's your old man?

43:30.707 --> 43:35.045
Still sucking cock at the county fair?

43:39.007 --> 43:42.218
Gerri, been sent anything funny lately?

43:42.218 --> 43:44.678
All a bit horrible for me.
Thanks, Logan.

43:44.678 --> 43:48.724
I'm not being horrible,
I'm being fun. Fucking Munsters.

43:48.724 --> 43:50.518
Okay, very good. Hang on.

43:52.895 --> 43:56.607
So, she would like
to get this figured out

43:57.400 --> 43:59.486
in theory, at least, tonight.

43:59.486 --> 44:01.779
The uncertainty is not good.

44:01.779 --> 44:04.115
They would like us to get
our best foot forward

44:04.115 --> 44:06.326
on an indicative price tonight.

44:07.576 --> 44:10.413
No need to play nice.
Should I tell her to fuck off?

44:12.374 --> 44:14.333
- Loge?
- I'm thinking.

44:23.510 --> 44:26.054
- Is she talking to them?
- I think so.

44:26.054 --> 44:31.142
Okay, okay, okay.
Kerry, I may need input.

44:31.142 --> 44:32.811
Tellis, you there?

44:33.477 --> 44:35.939
Hey, yeah.
I think we can get that together.

44:35.939 --> 44:38.525
Okay, so were gonna go in
and say eight.

44:38.525 --> 44:40.068
We're starting at eight.

44:40.068 --> 44:42.570
But if we're going for this,
let's not be hard asses.

44:42.570 --> 44:44.656
We gotta let her know that we can
see upside,

44:44.656 --> 44:46.324
but she's gotta help us prove it out.

44:46.324 --> 44:50.327
What? Yes, I'm interested.
Shut up!

44:50.327 --> 44:53.123
- Okay. So should I...
- Yeah, she likes you.

44:53.123 --> 44:56.041
- Eight is good.
- Thanks, T.

44:56.041 --> 44:57.584
Great, call you back.

44:59.421 --> 45:01.881
Tell her what?
We anchor at seven?

45:02.297 --> 45:03.841
Not a problem.

45:05.218 --> 45:06.594
Not too insulting?

45:06.594 --> 45:09.638
It's fine. I mean, it's insulting,

45:09.638 --> 45:13.059
but it's not like you're wasting
relationship capital. She hates you.

45:13.059 --> 45:15.562
Start at six.
But like you're kidding around.

45:15.562 --> 45:18.439
Seven is what we soft-floated, right?

45:18.439 --> 45:21.483
Six.
Find something we've lost conviction on

45:21.483 --> 45:25.530
just to let her know that we're not
Terry fucking Turnip Truck over here.

45:27.032 --> 45:29.783
Hi, Nan!

45:29.783 --> 45:35.039
This may be hard to say for me
and to tear for you...

45:40.794 --> 45:42.255
Thank you.

45:44.674 --> 45:48.928
Hi, Nan.
So I think we're looking at...

45:49.846 --> 45:53.307
Were very relaxed about
the eight billion landing spot.

45:54.184 --> 45:56.144
This is disgusting.

45:58.145 --> 45:59.397
But thank you.

46:00.189 --> 46:02.484
- We'll just need a minute.
- Okay.

46:08.156 --> 46:09.531
Right.

46:12.660 --> 46:14.371
They didn't love it.

46:15.204 --> 46:16.789
What are they up to,
do you think?

46:16.789 --> 46:19.751
- I don't know.
- I don't wanna lose this, Tommy.

46:19.751 --> 46:22.712
You wanna just jump right up?
What to?

46:25.756 --> 46:28.009
Call your wife. Call Shiv.

46:30.469 --> 46:32.554
So, she appreciates eight.

46:32.554 --> 46:35.225
Yeah? She appreciates it? Cool.

46:35.225 --> 46:38.979
But she wonders
if there's a little more upside.

46:41.648 --> 46:46.443
Okay. Telly. Hello.

46:46.443 --> 46:50.698
Eight-five. Can we go there, T?

46:51.366 --> 46:54.410
I don't have the precise composition
of our consortium.

46:54.410 --> 46:58.622
But I know the asset
and I think we can get there.

46:58.622 --> 47:01.459
You fucking jerking it to your
yacht catalogue there, T?

47:01.459 --> 47:03.711
This is exciting, guys!

47:03.711 --> 47:05.838
Thanks, Tellis.
That's a great insight.

47:05.838 --> 47:08.633
He's gonna bill us 200 mil
for that strategy advice.

47:09.883 --> 47:11.051
Incoming.

47:12.387 --> 47:13.805
Hello? Tom?

47:15.222 --> 47:19.476
Okay. He wants a discussion.

47:19.476 --> 47:22.563
What? Dad's got Tom on this?
What? Was Colin not available?

47:22.563 --> 47:25.984
- Hey, Shiv.
- Fuck you, mountain man!

47:25.984 --> 47:28.612
Hey! We were just wondering

47:29.361 --> 47:33.407
if we're not being played a little
since this is all indicative.

47:33.407 --> 47:35.243
What did he go up to, Tom?

47:35.243 --> 47:38.579
- I can't tell you that.
- Come on, you can tell me.

47:39.331 --> 47:42.249
Did he go to nine?
He didn't go to nine, did he?

47:42.249 --> 47:45.502
We were just wondering,
all things being equal,

47:45.502 --> 47:47.213
the asset does have a price

47:47.213 --> 47:52.259
and it would be crazy to add
an emotional premium here.

47:52.259 --> 47:54.971
So should we be looking
for a back door on this?

47:54.971 --> 47:56.388
What's Dad's ceiling?

47:56.388 --> 47:57.766
Well, what's your ceiling?

47:57.766 --> 48:00.226
You go first, Tommy.
Build that trust, bruh.

48:01.770 --> 48:03.604
His ceiling is...

48:05.314 --> 48:08.026
Your dad is just...

48:09.818 --> 48:11.821
Shiv, could we just talk?

48:11.821 --> 48:14.573
- Our ceiling is 12.
- Fuck off!

48:14.573 --> 48:16.368
- Yeah.
- Okay, sure.

48:16.825 --> 48:19.079
Ours, too. Okay.

48:22.873 --> 48:27.837
I think Dad is gonna go to nine. 9,5.

48:27.837 --> 48:32.299
So we need to be at 9,5.
Right, Tellis?

48:34.885 --> 48:39.723
I wonder if we don't nickel and dime it
and we just go to ten.

48:42.726 --> 48:48.233
So, we think Dad's at eight-five, nine.
So, we go nine-five to top them out.

48:48.233 --> 48:52.194
But ten?
Just to show that were really serious?

48:52.194 --> 48:58.243
That's just an extra half bil?

48:58.576 --> 49:00.870
It's definitive.
It ends the conversation.

49:00.870 --> 49:03.373
Well, that's a pretty penny
for a conversation ender.

49:03.373 --> 49:05.583
Can't I just, like, jizz
in her Break Bumper?

49:05.583 --> 49:06.792
It rounds it out.

49:06.792 --> 49:09.837
It does that,
it makes it extremely divisible.

49:09.837 --> 49:13.717
Half a billion dollars
is 500 million dollars.

49:13.717 --> 49:17.345
A million is a thousand thousand.
You do know that.

49:17.345 --> 49:21.890
500 times a thousand thousand
of actual money

49:21.890 --> 49:26.103
that we could be spending
on snowmobiles and sushi.

49:26.103 --> 49:28.940
It's getting toppy, but it would be
great to be the preferred bidder.

49:28.940 --> 49:32.234
But is it actually worth it?

49:32.652 --> 49:35.863
It's worth what the top bidder
will pay, I guess.

49:35.863 --> 49:38.700
I really wish I went to Harvard
Business School like you, T.

49:38.700 --> 49:41.911
It is intimidating talking to
an intellectual giant like yourself.

49:41.911 --> 49:44.539
- Ten?
- Ten.

49:45.540 --> 49:46.874
I mean...

49:48.668 --> 49:51.503
Okay.
Yeah, ten. Fuck you. Ten.

50:00.305 --> 50:01.806
So. Nan, look.

50:02.307 --> 50:04.058
We love the company
and the heritage,

50:04.058 --> 50:06.478
and we'd like to make an offer
that we think values the company

50:06.478 --> 50:08.771
and ends the conversation
and closes this out.

50:09.355 --> 50:11.691
On an indicative handshake,
we'd like to take Pierce

50:11.691 --> 50:15.195
to the next stage of its evolution
with a bid of ten billion dollars.

50:20.075 --> 50:22.409
That gives us something
to think about.

50:32.545 --> 50:35.256
So they're not accepting
another bidder.

50:35.256 --> 50:36.423
Excuse me?

50:36.423 --> 50:39.134
They said they've received
a conversation-ending offer.

50:39.134 --> 50:42.430
- Tell them I'll go up.
- She says they're content.

50:42.931 --> 50:44.391
That's bullshit.

50:45.558 --> 50:48.435
I get the impression
it's upwards of 9,5.

50:50.062 --> 50:53.107
Fucking geniuses. Ten?

50:53.107 --> 50:54.818
I get a ten feeling.

50:58.862 --> 51:01.741
Kind of feels like we should
fucking open some champagne.

51:02.408 --> 51:05.912
I am going back to LA
to retire to my bedroom

51:05.912 --> 51:09.289
and pull myself off
quite aggressively hard.

51:09.289 --> 51:11.417
- Shotgun.
- Hang on!

51:11.417 --> 51:14.212
- Will you speakerphone me, Shiv?
- Yeah. It's Tom.

51:15.797 --> 51:17.089
Hi! Okay.

51:17.089 --> 51:19.299
So, I have your dad
and he has a message.

51:21.260 --> 51:25.931
Congratulations on saying the biggest
number, you fucking morons.

51:39.154 --> 51:40.654
I think we got him.

51:44.658 --> 51:47.495
Yeah.

52:36.670 --> 52:38.088
It's me.

52:39.839 --> 52:41.090
Mondale...

52:44.176 --> 52:45.387
It's okay.

53:06.241 --> 53:07.658
Hey.

53:08.451 --> 53:10.036
Sorry, did I wake you?

53:10.036 --> 53:12.497
No. I thought you were hoteling.

53:13.206 --> 53:16.000
I needed wardrobe access, actually.

53:16.835 --> 53:18.753
I thought you took your favorites.

53:18.753 --> 53:21.423
I don't wanna be restricted
to my favorites, Tom.

53:21.423 --> 53:23.591
Okay. Do you wanna talk?

53:31.515 --> 53:35.061
I hear you and Greg call yourselves
the Disgusting Brothers now.

53:37.938 --> 53:39.274
Pretty cool.

53:40.150 --> 53:43.236
Do you have a logo,
and do you do "The Rules"?

53:44.321 --> 53:46.196
Is Greg your wingman?

53:46.822 --> 53:49.117
We sometimes grab a drink, Shiv.

53:49.117 --> 53:54.247
It's pretty cool.
I hear you date models now.

53:56.291 --> 54:01.588
We agreed that we could have a look
around while we had a think, right?

54:03.339 --> 54:05.049
You look good. Ripped.

54:05.049 --> 54:07.051
Well, I don't think so.
But thank you.

54:07.051 --> 54:09.136
Did you get buff for the models, Tom?

54:09.136 --> 54:12.057
Do you bring them back here
and do the positions?

54:12.599 --> 54:15.101
Do you do all the positions
with your models now, Tom?

54:15.101 --> 54:16.645
Do you take turns with Greg?

54:17.394 --> 54:19.521
Do they sit on your face
to shut you up?

54:20.189 --> 54:22.859
Do you really want to get into a full
accounting of all the pain

54:22.859 --> 54:26.779
in our marriage? If you do,
I can do that.

54:31.409 --> 54:32.827
How's Mondale?

54:32.827 --> 54:34.913
Mondale's fine.
Don't worry about him.

54:35.872 --> 54:38.916
I guess he doesn't recognize
your scent any longer.

54:40.876 --> 54:44.464
Well, things have become complicated.

54:46.883 --> 54:48.676
I wonder if there's even
a way through this.

54:49.636 --> 54:50.803
Right.

54:51.554 --> 54:55.099
You know, I wonder
if we might've run out of road.

54:56.893 --> 55:00.522
We were going to have
a big talk.

55:00.522 --> 55:03.149
I wonder if you might want
to make it official, you know?

55:03.149 --> 55:04.483
Do you wanna talk?

55:04.483 --> 55:07.611
There's some things I wouldn't mind
saying and explaining.

55:09.697 --> 55:14.452
I don't wanna rake up a whole lot
of bullshit for no profit, Tom.

55:15.161 --> 55:18.331
- But I feel...
- Just stop!

55:18.331 --> 55:23.293
I don't think it's good for me
to hear all that.

55:26.880 --> 55:31.136
I think it might be time
for you and I to move on.

55:51.031 --> 55:52.741
That makes me sad.

55:54.408 --> 55:55.785
Sure.

55:57.245 --> 55:59.289
And you don't want to talk
about what happened?

55:59.289 --> 56:01.958
I think we could talk things to death.

56:03.751 --> 56:06.796
But actually, we both just made
some mistakes.

56:10.383 --> 56:15.346
I think a whole lot of crying
and bullshit is not gonna help that.

56:15.346 --> 56:16.847
If you're good,

56:16.847 --> 56:20.310
we can just walk away
with our heads held high

56:21.602 --> 56:24.397
and say good luck, yeah?

56:25.941 --> 56:28.068
Well, okay.

56:49.797 --> 56:53.467
I could see if I can make love to you.

56:57.596 --> 56:59.223
Would you like to?

57:04.895 --> 57:06.814
I don't think so, Tom.

57:13.612 --> 57:16.533
Should I go? Or are you gonna go?

57:23.622 --> 57:25.875
I'm tired, so...

57:27.209 --> 57:31.047
But you can stay there,
if you like.

57:31.922 --> 57:33.507
Okay.

57:40.056 --> 57:42.642
So this is it?

57:45.561 --> 57:47.939
Yeah, I guess.

57:58.366 --> 57:59.909
Gave it a go...

58:09.460 --> 58:10.961
Yeah, we gave it a go.

58:14.798 --> 58:18.178
Two men sustained
life-threatening injuries

58:18.178 --> 58:21.681
as result of a brawl gone too far.

58:21.681 --> 58:26.810
However, no shots were fired
at this family friendly 3-day event.

58:26.810 --> 58:29.022
Instead, Brian Allen
and Pete Meyers,

58:29.022 --> 58:31.524
two firearms experts
in their own right...

58:32.817 --> 58:34.778
Hello? Logan?

58:35.403 --> 58:39.198
Cyd, I just watched the top
of the hour.

58:40.866 --> 58:45.537
It's bullshit.
People watch at night,

58:46.790 --> 58:49.083
I watch at night.

58:51.251 --> 58:53.754
Who is this fucking lunk anyway?

58:53.754 --> 58:56.549
He looks like a ball sack in a toupee.

58:57.676 --> 59:02.847
Are you losing it, Cyd?
Are you fucking losing it?

59:03.473 --> 59:06.559
I'm on it. Don't worry.

59:06.559 --> 59:11.605
"This has sullied a family-oriented
and entirely peaceful occasion."

59:11.605 --> 59:16.235
The Fayetteville Gun Show continues.
We'll be back right after this.
