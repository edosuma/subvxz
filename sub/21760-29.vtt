What do you wanna do
for fun today, Rolly?

01:29.620 --> 01:31.210
Well, let's see now.

01:31.210 --> 01:34.920
There's breakfast,
brunch, lunch!

01:34.920 --> 01:36.920
Afternoon snack,
high tea...

01:36.920 --> 01:39.040
There's something new.

01:39.040 --> 01:40.120
Oww!

01:42.000 --> 01:43.920
Whoa, check this out!

01:43.920 --> 01:46.120
The new Thunderbolt movie.

01:46.120 --> 01:48.710
And it's showing
at the CruellaPlex.

01:48.710 --> 01:51.080
Gee, sure wish we
could see it.

01:51.080 --> 01:53.080
What's stopping us?

01:53.080 --> 01:54.830
Can't you read?

01:54.830 --> 01:56.170
It says,

01:56.170 --> 01:58.710
"No animals allowed!"

01:58.710 --> 02:02.080
I'm not an animal,
I'm a Dalmatian.

02:02.080 --> 02:04.620
Maybe we should look
for another theater.

02:04.620 --> 02:05.880
We're wasting time.

02:05.880 --> 02:07.790
The matinee starts
any minute.

02:07.790 --> 02:10.380
We can just make it
to the last matinee.

02:10.380 --> 02:12.250
Sneaking is bad,
isn't it?

02:12.250 --> 02:15.710
Lucky, your obsession
with Thunderbolt

02:15.710 --> 02:18.500
has caused you to lose
your moral center.

02:18.500 --> 02:21.880
But we have to sneak in.
They won't sell us tickets.

02:21.880 --> 02:25.000
Oh, shifting
the blame to others.

02:25.000 --> 02:26.880
Good save!

02:33.500 --> 02:35.670
We're just in time.

02:53.210 --> 02:57.830
Welcome to the House of De Vil's
Concession Stand Collection,

02:57.830 --> 03:01.620
exclusively
at the CruellaPlex Theatre.

03:01.620 --> 03:05.330
Now you can have good taste
and eat it, too.

03:05.330 --> 03:08.420
Ha ha ha ha!

03:08.420 --> 03:11.540
I'm wearing one of my delicious
new designs,

03:11.540 --> 03:13.710
the Popcorn Poncho.

03:13.710 --> 03:17.250
It even comes
with butter flavoring.

03:17.250 --> 03:19.790
Eeeee!

03:19.790 --> 03:24.040
Now here's Jasperella
in our new line of gummy wear.

03:24.040 --> 03:27.670
Floaty and functional
and, best of all, edible.

03:29.580 --> 03:32.250
Isn't she sweet?

03:32.250 --> 03:36.040
And here's Horacina
in our entree ensemble.

03:36.040 --> 03:39.710
A sassy combination
of sausage and soda.

03:39.710 --> 03:41.250
Eccch!

03:41.250 --> 03:44.830
All our designs
are on sale at
the concession stand.

03:44.830 --> 03:48.670
Don't be afraid
to make a fashion
statement, people.

03:48.670 --> 03:51.000
They're scary, like you.

03:51.000 --> 03:52.250
I take it back.

03:52.250 --> 03:55.750
Be afraid,
be very afraid!

03:57.710 --> 04:01.670
Memo to myself: repeal
freedom of speech in Grutely.

04:03.040 --> 04:04.750
Now's our chance, come on!

04:07.210 --> 04:10.710
Tickets. Tickets, please.

04:10.710 --> 04:13.120
(alarm bells ringing,
woman gasps)

04:13.120 --> 04:15.920
Hold on there, lady.

04:18.000 --> 04:22.290
Sneaking in some confectionery
contraband today, are we, huh?

04:22.290 --> 04:26.830
Listen, you'll buy it from us,
or it's bye-bye from us!

04:36.830 --> 04:39.710
Rolly: Ooh, wienies!

04:48.830 --> 04:52.120
Oh, nice try, mutt.

04:52.120 --> 04:53.670
Heh heh heh!

04:53.670 --> 04:57.120
You buy your snacks inside
like everybody else.

04:58.170 --> 05:00.330
Hey, hey, hey,
stop that dog!

05:00.330 --> 05:02.750
Somebody-- Come here.
I'm gonna-- Oh!

05:04.000 --> 05:07.000
Huh

05:07.000 --> 05:08.750
Horace: No.

05:09.790 --> 05:12.330
Hit the road, wishbone!

05:13.920 --> 05:15.960
Way to go, Rolly.

05:15.960 --> 05:19.380
I'm sure there's
another way in.

05:19.380 --> 05:21.420
You know what they say,

05:21.420 --> 05:23.210
when one door closes,

05:23.210 --> 05:25.290
another one opens.

05:28.210 --> 05:31.080
Hey, they were right,
Cadpig.

05:31.080 --> 05:33.380
Look, the other door
is open.

05:33.380 --> 05:36.170
Spot: How are we gonna get past
the delivery guy?

05:37.710 --> 05:41.000
I have an idea.
Follow me.

05:41.000 --> 05:45.750
This box has been opened.
Are you shorting me again?

05:45.750 --> 05:47.710
I'll count every straw.

05:47.710 --> 05:50.330
But this
is for the straws

05:50.330 --> 05:52.330
you said you were
shorted last week.

05:52.330 --> 05:53.960
Oh, so it is.

05:53.960 --> 05:56.120
Well, don't let it
happen again,

05:56.120 --> 05:58.080
or it'll be
the last straw.

06:04.790 --> 06:06.080
We're in!

06:06.080 --> 06:07.750
We're winners!

06:07.750 --> 06:10.460
We're missing somebody.

06:10.460 --> 06:12.670
Where's Rolly?

06:18.460 --> 06:19.620
Hey!

06:21.380 --> 06:23.670
Get outta here!

06:23.670 --> 06:25.250
Whoa!

06:26.880 --> 06:30.330
Hey, lemme in, guys!

06:30.330 --> 06:32.710
Lucky: It's locked.
Is there another door?

06:40.920 --> 06:43.620
Hold onto this licorice
with your teeth, Rolly.

06:47.080 --> 06:49.460
Don't eat it!

06:49.460 --> 06:51.580
You're kiddin',
right?

06:51.580 --> 06:53.040
all: No!

06:53.040 --> 06:54.620
Okay, but hurry!

06:54.620 --> 06:56.670
I'm weakening.

07:06.830 --> 07:08.380
Whoaaa!

07:11.670 --> 07:14.880
Come on, nothin's
stoppin' us now.

07:16.710 --> 07:19.710
One Popcorn Poncho, please.

07:19.710 --> 07:22.250
Small, medium, or large?

07:22.250 --> 07:25.250
Got one in a 42
large and lovely?

07:30.580 --> 07:33.000
Only one customer?

07:33.000 --> 07:36.380
How dare they resist
my food fashions!

07:36.380 --> 07:39.000
There's no accounting
for taste.

07:39.000 --> 07:40.620
We'll see about this!

07:41.960 --> 07:43.210
Hmm?

07:50.040 --> 07:51.750
Thread this up.

07:51.750 --> 07:53.380
It's a little
subliminal advertising

07:53.380 --> 07:55.000
for the audience.

07:59.580 --> 08:00.540
We made it!

08:00.540 --> 08:03.620
Just in time, too.

08:03.620 --> 08:07.880
Man: Welcome to
the CruellaPlex Theatre...

08:10.540 --> 08:15.540
No movie, unless you buy more
food from the concession stand!

08:15.540 --> 08:17.580
Aaaaah!

08:19.750 --> 08:21.500
It's true!

08:21.500 --> 08:24.290
The camera does put on pounds.

08:24.290 --> 08:28.580
Memo to myself: move up
liposuction appointment.

08:31.750 --> 08:33.620
We've been spotted.

08:33.620 --> 08:35.920
We were born
that way, Luck.

08:35.920 --> 08:38.080
It's part
of who we are.

08:38.080 --> 08:40.420
No, I mean we've been seen.

08:40.420 --> 08:43.620
Oh, he's gonna
tell Cruella!

08:43.620 --> 08:45.170
Lucky: Grab him!

08:53.540 --> 08:57.420
Scorch, get out!
You're ruining my hair!

08:57.420 --> 08:59.080
Catch them, you dolt!

08:59.080 --> 09:01.750
I'll call the pound
and be rid of them.

09:01.750 --> 09:05.000
Three down, 98 to go.

09:05.000 --> 09:07.580
Scorch: Yee-aaaa!

09:20.460 --> 09:22.580
Do we serve nuggets?

09:22.580 --> 09:23.830
No.

09:23.830 --> 09:25.920
We do now!

09:29.540 --> 09:30.540
Aaaaah!

09:31.580 --> 09:33.580
Ugggh!

09:33.580 --> 09:34.960
Ooomph!

09:37.210 --> 09:39.080
Hey, Aaaah!

09:41.540 --> 09:43.580
-Oh...
-Oh...

09:47.960 --> 09:49.460
Cruella:
Ow, ooh, ooh, ow, oh!

09:49.460 --> 09:51.500
Announcer:
Thunderbolt!

09:52.790 --> 09:54.880
Don't hold onto
the past, Lucky.

09:54.880 --> 09:56.380
Let it go.

09:56.380 --> 09:57.750
Move on!

09:57.750 --> 09:59.620
Catch it
on cable!

10:02.250 --> 10:04.830
Off me, you fools!

10:11.750 --> 10:15.000
Lucky: I wish I could get
my mind off Thunderbolt.

10:15.000 --> 10:18.000
I can still hear
his theme music.

10:18.000 --> 10:20.540
Don't listen!

10:20.540 --> 10:22.420
That's just
your subconscious

10:22.420 --> 10:23.460
tormenting you.

10:23.460 --> 10:25.500
It's tormenting me, too.

10:25.500 --> 10:26.920
From over there!

10:28.080 --> 10:30.540
What incredible
kinetic power.

10:30.540 --> 10:33.580
You are throwing
your subconscious!

10:33.580 --> 10:34.880
That's not me.

10:34.880 --> 10:36.580
It's coming
from over there.

10:41.080 --> 10:42.380
Thunderbolt!

10:42.380 --> 10:45.000
There you are, Lucky.
We were looking for you.

10:45.000 --> 10:47.290
Shh! I don't wanna miss
anything!

10:52.080 --> 10:53.460
"The end"?

10:53.460 --> 10:55.670
I don't believe this!

10:55.670 --> 10:58.420
Oh, man, we went
to all that trouble,

10:58.420 --> 11:00.920
and the movie is here!

11:00.920 --> 11:02.500
We thought you knew.

11:02.500 --> 11:05.290
The paper was open to the ad
right where you left it.

11:05.290 --> 11:07.710
Well, we were in such a hurry
to see the movie,

11:07.710 --> 11:09.620
we didn't see the other ad.

11:09.620 --> 11:11.500
others: "We"?

11:11.500 --> 11:14.080
Okay, okay,
I was in a hurry.

11:14.080 --> 11:15.420
Gimme a break.

11:15.420 --> 11:19.460
We just want you to break free
of your impulsiveness, Lucky,

11:19.460 --> 11:21.830
as quickly as possible.

11:21.830 --> 11:24.920
Thanks to me we missed
the movie of a lifetime

11:24.920 --> 11:27.040
twice in one day.

11:27.040 --> 11:29.420
Well, we can always
come back tomorrow.

11:29.420 --> 11:31.210
We can, really?

11:31.210 --> 11:32.500
All right!

11:32.500 --> 11:35.750
Oh, I wish tomorrow
would hurry up and get here!

11:48.290 --> 11:51.380
♪ Rrr... rrr... rrr ♪

11:51.380 --> 11:54.290
♪ Rrrrrrrr! ♪

12:11.790 --> 12:13.040
Heh heh!

12:18.500 --> 12:20.920
Lucky:
Who's up for Frisbee!

12:22.380 --> 12:25.250
Cornelia: Oh, yes, it should
be quite an evening.

12:25.250 --> 12:30.460
Well, the Silver Egg Social
is the party of the year.

12:30.460 --> 12:34.080
I dare say my little Missy
may just end up being

12:34.080 --> 12:36.580
the Belle of the Ball.

12:36.580 --> 12:38.210
Oh, really? Well,

12:38.210 --> 12:41.920
don't be too sure my Spot
won't outshine her.

12:41.920 --> 12:46.210
She's blossomed into
the ideal picture
of chickenly refinement.

12:46.210 --> 12:50.210
She's smart, polite, and--
if I do say so myself--

12:50.210 --> 12:52.330
quite graceful.

12:55.580 --> 12:56.960
Ptooey!

12:59.290 --> 13:03.080
Well, I see you weren't
exaggerating one bit.

13:03.080 --> 13:05.460
Let's just hope
no one gets hurt.

13:07.620 --> 13:09.580
Spot!

13:09.580 --> 13:11.500
The Silver Egg Social?

13:11.500 --> 13:13.250
B-b-but that's
for chickens!

13:13.250 --> 13:17.120
Exactly. And it's time you
started acting like a chicken

13:17.120 --> 13:20.580
instead of some bone-digging,
kibble-eating,

13:20.580 --> 13:22.420
tree-sniffing dog!

13:24.000 --> 13:25.210
But I am a dog!

13:25.210 --> 13:28.000
I'm a dog trapped
in a chicken's body!

13:29.330 --> 13:33.420
I don't care if you're
an aardvark trapped
in a baboon's pinkie,

13:33.420 --> 13:35.330
you're going to the social!

13:35.330 --> 13:37.670
And you'll act
like a proper chicken

13:37.670 --> 13:40.830
or I'm sending you out
to chicken finishing school!

13:51.670 --> 13:52.960
Finished!

13:52.960 --> 13:56.460
It's my most
brilliant design ever!

13:58.210 --> 14:02.250
El Pollo Poncho!

14:02.250 --> 14:04.620
Oh, Madam, it's,
uh, different.

14:04.620 --> 14:07.290
And, uh... and elegant.

14:07.290 --> 14:08.960
Really?!

14:08.960 --> 14:13.210
Well, oddly enough, I don't
need your expert opinion.

14:13.210 --> 14:15.420
I need feathers.

14:15.420 --> 14:16.750
Get me feathers!

14:16.750 --> 14:18.210
both: Owww!

14:21.830 --> 14:25.330
You've got your feathers
in a knot for nothing, Spot.

14:25.330 --> 14:28.170
Yeah, Spot, all you gotta do
is go to a party

14:28.170 --> 14:30.000
and act like a chicken.

14:30.000 --> 14:32.120
So, what's the problem?

14:32.120 --> 14:36.290
Aaaah! I can't remember how
to act like a chicken.

14:36.290 --> 14:38.120
I'm blankin' here!

14:44.250 --> 14:47.710
There I go,
chasing my tail again.

14:47.710 --> 14:51.000
Eh, don't worry, Spot,
we'll help you.

14:51.000 --> 14:54.420
Sure, we'll teach you how
to act like a chicken.

14:54.420 --> 14:56.330
Whaddya say?

14:56.330 --> 14:59.040
I, uh, I think I have fleas.

15:02.750 --> 15:04.580
This wig itches.

15:04.580 --> 15:05.750
Shh!

15:07.290 --> 15:08.290
The pigeons
won't come

15:08.290 --> 15:09.830
if they think we're
after their feathers.

15:09.830 --> 15:12.290
Then we gotta give 'em
more bird seed.

15:13.380 --> 15:14.420
Ugggh!

15:14.420 --> 15:16.670
Wait, you don't know
what you're--

15:16.670 --> 15:18.920
Give it!

15:18.920 --> 15:20.120
No!

15:26.290 --> 15:29.250
both: Whoaaaa...

15:33.250 --> 15:34.710
...aaaaa!

15:38.500 --> 15:40.460
What we're going
for here, Spot,

15:40.460 --> 15:42.420
is an oval shape.

15:42.420 --> 15:44.290
You think you can
do it?

15:44.290 --> 15:47.120
I don't know.
I never tried before.

15:47.120 --> 15:49.170
Well, if you want to act
like a chicken,

15:49.170 --> 15:50.290
you've gotta try.

15:57.120 --> 15:58.580
Ahhhh!

16:01.670 --> 16:04.210
Okay, very good.

16:04.210 --> 16:06.710
Now, think oval.

16:20.120 --> 16:23.040
Lucky: I think we've got
a problem.

16:33.210 --> 16:36.880
Are you sure this is
the ostrich section?

16:36.880 --> 16:39.170
I don't see
any ostrich-ches.

16:39.170 --> 16:40.290
Positive.

16:40.290 --> 16:43.040
Now, let's start
collecting feathers.

16:51.080 --> 16:54.920
Now, how does a proper chicken
eat dinner, Spot?

17:03.750 --> 17:04.880
No, no, no,

17:04.880 --> 17:06.120
you're a chicken!

17:07.620 --> 17:12.170
You mean, as in
eat it off the ground?

17:12.170 --> 17:14.500
Ewww! Gross!

17:14.500 --> 17:17.540
I'm gonna have to
agree with her here.

17:19.120 --> 17:20.880
This whistle
will attract

17:20.880 --> 17:22.540
every purple-bellied
gut warbler

17:22.540 --> 17:24.210
within
a 30-mile radius.

17:31.830 --> 17:33.420
I wonder why
they won't come.

17:36.750 --> 17:40.330
(Horace and Jasper shrieking,
alligator teeth chomping)

17:42.120 --> 17:43.750
Spot:
What am I gonna do?

17:43.750 --> 17:45.750
The Silver Egg Social's
in two hours

17:45.750 --> 17:48.540
and I'm just not ready.

17:48.540 --> 17:50.920
Shh!
You have to relax
if you're going

17:50.920 --> 17:53.080
to get in touch
with your
inner chicken.

17:53.080 --> 17:57.040
And all it takes to find it is
a little emotional flexibility

17:57.040 --> 18:01.460
and some good
old-fashioned hypnosis.

18:07.420 --> 18:10.080
Uh, yep,
it worked, all right.

18:14.120 --> 18:16.830
I think I'm gonna lay an egg.

18:16.830 --> 18:19.330
10 to 1,
it's scrambled.

18:20.790 --> 18:23.500
Are you cracked?!

18:23.500 --> 18:27.210
It's called El Pollo Poncho,
not El Pillow Poncho!

18:29.750 --> 18:30.880
But, Miss Cruella, sir!

18:30.880 --> 18:32.880
But, ma'am,
the feathers--

18:32.880 --> 18:34.170
Are duck feathers!

18:34.170 --> 18:36.500
Pollo means chicken.

18:36.500 --> 18:39.420
I need
chicken feathers!

18:39.420 --> 18:41.880
both: Owwww!

18:51.790 --> 18:54.120
Now, Spot, don't fret.

18:54.120 --> 18:55.790
If you get flustered,

18:55.790 --> 18:58.920
just do whatever
Mrs. Rockfeather's
daughter does.

18:58.920 --> 19:01.120
Rockfeather:
Oh, Cornelia, Spot!

19:01.120 --> 19:04.040
I'm delighted you actually
had the nerve to come.

19:04.040 --> 19:06.920
This is my daughter,
Missy.

19:11.620 --> 19:15.380
Well, why don't you
two young ladies go
enjoy yourselves?

19:21.120 --> 19:22.960
♪ Bawk-bawk bawk-bawk ♪

19:25.420 --> 19:27.830
♪ Bawk-bawk bawk-bawk ♪

19:29.920 --> 19:31.880
♪ Bawk-bawk bawk-bawk ♪

19:34.330 --> 19:36.080
♪ Bawk-bawk bawk-bawk ♪

19:38.420 --> 19:40.080
(ah-ooga horn
blows)

19:43.000 --> 19:45.040
♪ Bawk-bawk bawk-bawk ♪

19:45.040 --> 19:47.460
Waaaa!

20:06.920 --> 20:08.830
Oh! Look at me!

20:08.830 --> 20:10.750
And it's all your fault!

20:10.750 --> 20:11.960
My fault?!

20:11.960 --> 20:14.790
You and your ill-bred
little pullet!

20:18.830 --> 20:20.210
I smell trouble.

20:32.710 --> 20:34.790
Jasper: Ha ha!
Feather jackpot!

20:35.960 --> 20:38.080
Here, chicky, chicky, chicky!
Here, chicky, chicky!

20:44.540 --> 20:46.500
Whooo!

20:48.880 --> 20:50.420
Aaaaah!

20:51.750 --> 20:52.830
Yow!

20:55.960 --> 20:58.500
That's my daughter!

20:58.500 --> 21:01.080
Someone help me!

21:02.620 --> 21:04.790
Grrrrr!

21:06.420 --> 21:07.710
Go, Mom!

21:09.420 --> 21:11.000
Ohhh!

21:18.080 --> 21:21.000
Oh, Spot!
Thank you!

21:21.000 --> 21:22.500
I must say,

21:22.500 --> 21:25.000
you are one
remarkable
little chicken.

21:27.290 --> 21:29.040
Hah! I got one!

21:29.040 --> 21:30.380
Spot!

21:35.580 --> 21:36.960
Horace: Whoaaa!

21:43.880 --> 21:47.540
I mean, uh,
bawk-bawk-bawk-aaa!

21:47.540 --> 21:48.790
Don't worry, Spot!

21:48.790 --> 21:52.750
You can moo,
baa, or hee-haw
if you want to.

21:52.750 --> 21:55.540
You're fine, just
the way you are.

21:55.540 --> 21:57.580
And so are
your friends.

21:58.670 --> 22:00.420
Speaking of which,

22:00.420 --> 22:02.330
where's your friend Missy?

22:04.460 --> 22:05.620
Ptooey!

22:06.880 --> 22:08.750
They got me!
