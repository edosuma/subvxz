00:06.959 --> 00:09.535
Previously on "The Magicians"...

00:09.537 --> 00:11.088
Charlton?

00:11.090 --> 00:13.687
I was a passenger in your unconscious.

00:13.689 --> 00:16.470
- Now I'm still in your head...
- _

00:16.472 --> 00:18.487
But the conscious part.

00:18.489 --> 00:21.265
Whoa, I... I'm... I'm no professor.

00:21.267 --> 00:24.020
Penny, you're the only
Brakebills-educated traveler

00:24.022 --> 00:25.466
currently alive on this planet,

00:25.468 --> 00:27.705
which makes you far more
qualified to teach them

00:27.707 --> 00:29.073
than anyone else I have.

00:29.075 --> 00:30.441
It's Fogg.

00:30.443 --> 00:31.742
He's stuck in the Etheric Realm,

00:31.744 --> 00:34.801
and it's my fault.

00:34.803 --> 00:35.879
Hello.

00:35.881 --> 00:38.816
I am Bick of the
esteemed House Pickwick.

00:40.986 --> 00:43.854
I've been on the inside,
and I'm telling you

00:43.856 --> 00:45.522
it's a goddamn goose-stepping,

00:45.524 --> 00:48.859
fairy-snatching, ethnic
cleansing Gestapo.

00:54.100 --> 00:56.867
Jesus.

00:56.869 --> 01:00.804
So this pig dude told me
I'm supposed to do a quest?

01:00.806 --> 01:03.941
Yeah, it's fine, Todd. We fixed it.

01:03.943 --> 01:06.076
The Harmonic Convergence
isn't happening anymore.

01:06.078 --> 01:08.979
Uh, no. He was talking about Fillory.

01:08.981 --> 01:11.048
The end of Fillory?

01:11.050 --> 01:13.818
So we saved the wrong world?

01:20.493 --> 01:23.193
♪ Something, something, Fillory ♪

01:23.195 --> 01:26.530
♪ A most amazing land ♪

01:26.532 --> 01:31.969
♪ Butt-fucked by catastrophe,
and way before we planned ♪

01:31.971 --> 01:34.671
♪ La, la, blah, blah, Fillory ♪

01:34.673 --> 01:37.341
♪ A land without a god ♪

01:37.343 --> 01:40.344
♪ Needs a brand-new hero,
a strapping lad named... ♪

01:40.346 --> 01:42.880
- Todd, please stop.
- Okay.

01:42.882 --> 01:45.549
Okay. Just wanna get this straight.

01:45.551 --> 01:48.719
So Pig Man gave you the
quest in the form of a song?

01:48.721 --> 01:49.753
Yeah.

01:49.755 --> 01:51.455
I might have changed some of the lines,

01:51.457 --> 01:52.923
but that's the gist.

01:52.925 --> 01:54.892
There's also, like, three more verses,

01:54.894 --> 01:56.627
and the key change is tricky.

01:57.730 --> 01:59.885
- Or you could just write it down.
- Oh, I did.

01:59.887 --> 02:01.565
The parts I could remember, anyway,

02:01.567 --> 02:02.596
on a couple of napkins

02:02.598 --> 02:04.087
and then on the back of my hand,

02:04.089 --> 02:06.870
but don't worry. I transferred
that to another napkin.

02:06.872 --> 02:08.972
- But short version...
- Thank you.

02:08.973 --> 02:11.508
Fillory is in real trouble.

02:11.510 --> 02:14.506
He said death is coming

02:14.508 --> 02:16.441
for everyone.

02:16.443 --> 02:20.012
And then he rhymed
that with "smeveryone".

02:20.014 --> 02:23.048
Anyway, could you please help me?

02:23.050 --> 02:25.984
I'm not going to help you.

02:25.986 --> 02:28.220
I'm going to take over entirely for you.

02:28.222 --> 02:29.721
Oh, thank God,

02:29.723 --> 02:32.786
because I am dangerously
underqualified for this.

02:32.788 --> 02:33.792
I know.

02:33.794 --> 02:35.026
My notes are at Brakebills.

02:35.028 --> 02:36.495
I probably should've brought 'em.

02:36.497 --> 02:38.664
Okay, so I'll meet you there.

02:38.666 --> 02:40.667
- Kay, bye.
- Okay.

02:43.404 --> 02:45.418
Yeah, no shit, Fillory's in trouble.

02:45.420 --> 02:46.872
Goes by the name of the Dark King.

02:46.874 --> 02:49.374
Or whoever's ordering
dark shit on his behalf.

02:49.376 --> 02:50.442
We're still investigating.

02:50.444 --> 02:51.877
Which we were kind of in the middle of

02:51.879 --> 02:53.378
till you dragged us here
'cause you were sure

02:53.380 --> 02:54.997
Bacon McSwine-Flu was talking about

02:54.999 --> 02:56.615
the Harmonic Convergence.

02:56.617 --> 02:59.785
Oops, we accidentally stopped
billions of people from dying.

02:59.787 --> 03:01.520
- I'm sorry.
- Hmm.

03:01.522 --> 03:02.688
Look, I guessed wrong,

03:02.690 --> 03:04.756
which is why you guys should wait

03:04.758 --> 03:07.392
until I finish reading Todd's
notes before you rush off.

03:07.394 --> 03:09.394
Mm, I don't need Todd

03:09.396 --> 03:12.497
to tell me which twat's
messing up my kingdom.

03:12.499 --> 03:14.566
But if he gives you a clue
how to stop the Dark King,

03:14.568 --> 03:15.600
you know where to find us.

03:15.602 --> 03:17.569
Oh, and tell Josh to meet me

03:17.571 --> 03:19.871
once he's done with his
nephew's bar mitzvah.

03:19.873 --> 03:21.707
Dude drops everything for family.

03:21.709 --> 03:22.909
It's weird.

03:34.054 --> 03:35.822
Oh, shit.

03:37.468 --> 03:39.024
Uh, sorry I missed the meeting.

03:39.026 --> 03:41.093
- I can't travel, and...
- None of us can.

03:41.095 --> 03:42.994
We all made it here on time,

03:42.996 --> 03:45.597
'cause "emergency faculty meeting".

03:45.599 --> 03:46.996
Yeah, what's going on?
What did Lipson say?

03:46.998 --> 03:48.100
Well, she's in a coma,

03:48.102 --> 03:49.835
- so not much.
- What?

03:49.837 --> 03:51.636
I don't know if you
tried casting yet today,

03:51.638 --> 03:53.071
but FYI: don't.

03:53.073 --> 03:54.606
Circumstances are jacked.

03:54.608 --> 03:57.111
- Some asshole moved the moon.
- Oh, shit.

03:57.113 --> 03:59.811
Acting Dean Lipson was
resetting the campus wards,

03:59.813 --> 04:02.269
didn't realize the
Circumstances had changed.

04:02.271 --> 04:04.595
Fogg's security system
was sicced on her instead.

04:04.597 --> 04:06.551
- Is she gonna be okay?
- From what I hear,

04:06.553 --> 04:08.019
she didn't lose anything vital.

04:08.021 --> 04:09.588
Most of it'll grow back,

04:09.590 --> 04:11.146
but we can't even heal her be...

04:11.148 --> 04:12.691
Because some asshole moved the moon.

04:12.693 --> 04:13.892
- Yeah, I got it.
- Yeah.

04:17.029 --> 04:19.012
Can you shut the security system down

04:19.015 --> 04:20.346
before anyone else gets hurt?

04:20.349 --> 04:23.335
The Dean of Brakebills
can with this, in theory.

04:23.337 --> 04:26.638
Although, that's what Lipson
was doing when she got...

04:26.640 --> 04:27.706
Okay, so what?

04:27.708 --> 04:29.574
Are you in charge then?

04:29.576 --> 04:31.447
- You missed the boat.
- Oh, it's cool.

04:31.449 --> 04:32.711
I honestly couldn't give less of a shit.

04:32.713 --> 04:34.750
No, Penny. It's a horrible job.

04:34.752 --> 04:35.786
Nobody wants it.

04:35.788 --> 04:39.184
We all voted for you.

04:39.186 --> 04:42.521
You assholes.

04:42.523 --> 04:44.456
The hell am I even
supposed to do with this?

04:44.458 --> 04:45.791
Well, if I knew that,

04:45.793 --> 04:47.459
I wouldn't be giving it to you.

04:47.461 --> 04:49.762
Good luck.

05:08.048 --> 05:09.748
Where the hell could Fen have gone?

05:09.750 --> 05:11.082
I know, right?

05:11.084 --> 05:12.884
I gave her one... two...

05:12.886 --> 05:15.821
well, several jobs, but the headline was

05:15.823 --> 05:17.272
"stay put and find the creep

05:17.274 --> 05:18.795
with the hard-on for hunting fairies".

05:25.365 --> 05:27.132
- Okay, was he afraid of you?
- Yup.

05:27.134 --> 05:28.934
They all think it's my
"time of the month".

05:28.936 --> 05:31.002
- Woman or wolf?
- Who cares?

05:31.004 --> 05:33.280
Either way, I got 'em scared
they'll end up bleeding, too,

05:33.282 --> 05:35.106
so I'm off the hook for a few weeks.

05:35.108 --> 05:36.775
Perk of marching with a bunch of scrotes

05:36.777 --> 05:38.610
who have no clue how lady parts work.

05:38.612 --> 05:39.778
Mm.

05:43.650 --> 05:45.951
Yes, your most excellent Pouchful-ness.

05:45.953 --> 05:47.586
It'll be done straight away.

05:47.588 --> 05:50.422
I also brewed clover tea, your favorite.

05:51.959 --> 05:53.959
Odious veldt marmot.

05:53.961 --> 05:55.694
Problems with the new boss, Rafe?

05:55.696 --> 05:58.130
I hear she's a handful, between us.

05:59.299 --> 06:00.666
Between us?

06:02.269 --> 06:05.136
Her High Leapus Gertrude is a nightmare.

06:05.138 --> 06:06.738
Who's got the King's ear.

06:06.740 --> 06:07.973
Sadly, yes.

06:07.975 --> 06:09.641
I took the job with her to try and make

06:09.643 --> 06:12.110
the King's Council more animal-friendly,

06:12.112 --> 06:14.679
but that creature is
a traitor to her own.

06:14.681 --> 06:16.915
Never trust an animal with a pouch.

06:16.917 --> 06:20.619
She's nothing but a puppet
to the king's chief advisor.

06:20.621 --> 06:22.888
- Which is who again?
- Bick Pickwick.

06:22.890 --> 06:24.956
The sexist douche who
ran the tournament?

06:24.958 --> 06:26.825
He offered Her Long-footed-ness

06:26.827 --> 06:29.561
a handsome deal to permanently relocate

06:29.563 --> 06:32.163
all talking animals beyond the walls.

06:32.165 --> 06:35.467
Bick has a deep hatred
for anything non-human.

06:35.469 --> 06:37.936
- Non-human meaning fairies.
- Mm-hmm.

06:37.938 --> 06:39.838
Bick's position could also explain

06:39.840 --> 06:42.307
why there might be species
cleansing without Seb knowing.

06:42.309 --> 06:43.708
What are you, dickmatized?

06:43.710 --> 06:44.987
No way Seb doesn't know.

06:44.989 --> 06:46.761
There was plenty happening
I didn't know about

06:46.763 --> 06:49.014
- when I was High King.
- Which was fine, because you had me.

06:49.016 --> 06:50.649
And Her Slowness, Abigail.

06:50.651 --> 06:51.883
Oh.

06:51.885 --> 06:53.335
Look, we'll argue, and I'll win later.

06:53.337 --> 06:55.186
Right now we gotta find Fen
and see if she did her job

06:55.188 --> 06:57.689
and got any new intel on the fairies.

06:57.691 --> 06:59.691
Oh, I was supposed to tell you.

06:59.693 --> 07:02.794
Um, before she left, Fen said,

07:02.796 --> 07:07.132
"The Maid on the Outside
will soon be on the Inside".

07:07.134 --> 07:09.634
And by "inside", she meant...

07:09.636 --> 07:10.835
I'm not sure.

07:10.837 --> 07:13.705
At times, she is what the
animals call "human crazy".

07:13.707 --> 07:14.773
Anything else?

07:14.775 --> 07:15.974
Just that she was venturing

07:15.976 --> 07:17.709
into the Windward Woods.

07:17.711 --> 07:20.679
I'm gonna bank she's doing
her actual job fairy-wise

07:20.681 --> 07:22.080
and not just bird-watching.

07:22.082 --> 07:23.715
- Let's find her.
- You go ahead.

07:23.717 --> 07:25.918
I'll go pursue a
different line of inquiry.

07:34.161 --> 07:35.161
Yeah?

07:36.096 --> 07:37.996
Professor... I mean...

07:37.998 --> 07:39.631
Dean Adiyodi?

07:39.633 --> 07:41.233
Yeah, come in.

07:43.870 --> 07:45.737
I have a problem.

07:45.739 --> 07:47.873
A very big problem.

07:49.309 --> 07:51.876
Someone stole my pencil case.

07:51.878 --> 07:54.302
Full of... drugs?

07:54.304 --> 07:56.848
Pencils. Special pencils.

07:56.850 --> 07:58.590
And you thought,

07:58.592 --> 08:01.052
"Hey, this is a problem I
should bring to the Dean..."

08:01.054 --> 08:02.754
I think there's a conspiracy afoot,

08:02.756 --> 08:04.422
a league of mischief makers

08:04.424 --> 08:06.091
with a taste for high-end graphite.

08:09.429 --> 08:11.696
So we tried to cast a cleansing spell,

08:11.698 --> 08:14.699
and instead, it just...
it made live chickens.

08:14.701 --> 08:18.003
So many chickens.

08:18.005 --> 08:21.573
So apparently the fertility
and contraception charms

08:21.575 --> 08:24.909
got switched, so, um,

08:24.911 --> 08:27.146
we have a bit of a situation.

08:28.382 --> 08:30.622
They're special because of
their smear resistance and...

08:32.953 --> 08:34.753
I don't think you're
taking me very seriously.

08:34.755 --> 08:36.354
I promise you I am not.

08:36.356 --> 08:38.188
All the air in there
just turned to water.

08:38.191 --> 08:41.226
I shouldn't have to be able
to swim to take astronomy.

08:41.227 --> 08:43.229
Go away.

08:45.298 --> 08:47.832
You really did it this time, huh?

08:47.834 --> 08:49.234
Zelda warned us it would happen.

08:49.236 --> 08:51.603
We changed the Circumstances
of the moon for good.

08:51.605 --> 08:54.072
Yeah.

08:54.074 --> 08:55.373
What do we do?

08:55.375 --> 08:58.410
We try to live with what we did.

08:58.412 --> 09:00.011
Back to basics.

09:00.013 --> 09:02.414
Figure out how to cast again. Magic 101.

09:02.416 --> 09:03.782
That's why I'm here,

09:03.784 --> 09:05.617
but we have to figure it out fast.

09:05.619 --> 09:07.152
We stopped the Harmonic Convergence,

09:07.154 --> 09:08.887
but there's still too much magic.

09:08.889 --> 09:10.789
Right, and...

09:10.791 --> 09:12.390
If a surge happens,

09:12.392 --> 09:17.829
every spell already jacked is
gonna get me amped up to 11.

09:17.831 --> 09:19.230
Christ!

09:19.232 --> 09:22.368
It's too bad Fogg was
sober when he left.

09:27.307 --> 09:30.442
- What is it?
- I don't know.

09:30.444 --> 09:31.976
But I'd say this is an emergency.

09:31.978 --> 09:34.512
Wouldn't you?

09:34.514 --> 09:36.448
"For Emergencies Only".

09:36.450 --> 09:38.349
That's not ominous at all.

09:38.351 --> 09:40.852
Based on the locator spells on it,

09:40.854 --> 09:42.921
we thought maybe it was built to...

09:42.923 --> 09:44.355
To summon Fogg.

09:44.357 --> 09:46.257
Think it could reach the Etheric Realm?

09:46.259 --> 09:48.186
I mean, Kady said he can't leave,

09:48.188 --> 09:50.028
but maybe we could get a message out.

09:50.030 --> 09:52.097
Even if we could get it to reach Fogg,

09:52.099 --> 09:53.961
using any magic right
now could backfire,

09:53.963 --> 09:55.100
like it did to Lipson.

09:55.102 --> 09:57.357
Look, students are in actual danger,

09:57.359 --> 09:59.370
this campus is going haywire,

09:59.372 --> 10:01.372
no one knows when the next surge'll hit,

10:01.374 --> 10:03.842
and I have no idea how to help.

10:03.844 --> 10:05.310
I hate to admit it, but I think Fogg

10:05.312 --> 10:07.439
was doing way more work
than we give him credit for.

10:07.441 --> 10:08.530
We need him back,

10:08.532 --> 10:10.982
and if this thing can
at least contact him...

10:10.984 --> 10:13.551
Sounds like it's worth the risk.

10:13.553 --> 10:15.286
Okay.

10:15.288 --> 10:16.855
Whew.

10:16.857 --> 10:19.424
This shit messes me up.

10:19.426 --> 10:21.059
What the hell, Julia?

10:21.061 --> 10:23.295
I'm fine. Did it work?

10:25.565 --> 10:27.899
It's probably broken like
everything else in this school.

10:34.207 --> 10:35.741
Duty calls.

10:41.414 --> 10:43.248
Jesus. Hi.

10:43.250 --> 10:44.849
Where have you been?

10:44.851 --> 10:46.451
Well, I have to sleep sometimes,

10:46.453 --> 10:48.253
and everything you do
isn't that interesting.

10:48.255 --> 10:49.587
I'm thinking whatever I miss,

10:49.589 --> 10:51.890
I'll just find in your brain later.

10:51.892 --> 10:54.459
What do you people call
it? Uh, binge watching.

10:54.461 --> 10:56.161
I fear outright rebellion.

10:56.163 --> 10:58.013
The best and swiftest way to get it...

10:58.015 --> 10:59.697
To get what? Your Majesty.

10:59.699 --> 11:00.999
Gold.

11:01.001 --> 11:02.934
Our reserves are depleted.

11:02.936 --> 11:04.536
The salaries of our soldiers

11:04.538 --> 11:06.905
and barrier builders
haven't been paid in weeks,

11:06.907 --> 11:08.740
and both are threatening to strike.

11:08.742 --> 11:12.610
The slightest work stoppage
could imperil all of us.

11:12.612 --> 11:14.979
As reports indicate,

11:14.981 --> 11:17.448
the Takers are gathering in force.

11:17.450 --> 11:20.659
Which is why I must lead
a cohort of Centurions

11:20.661 --> 11:23.339
into the Windward
Woods and find the gold

11:23.341 --> 11:26.090
the fairies steal and hoard.

11:26.092 --> 11:29.060
Okay, but that really doesn't track.

11:29.062 --> 11:32.897
Fairies are into
mushrooms and milk baths.

11:32.899 --> 11:34.899
You have experience with them?

11:34.901 --> 11:36.367
I do, sire.

11:36.369 --> 11:38.303
Mostly bad, right?
According to your memories.

11:38.305 --> 11:40.205
Then you know that
they're as untrustworthy

11:40.207 --> 11:42.207
as they are greedy.

11:42.209 --> 11:45.143
They have purloined our
citizens' gold for years.

11:45.145 --> 11:47.078
My men and I will get it back.

11:47.080 --> 11:49.480
If I may, Your Majesty.

11:49.482 --> 11:51.182
I do have experience with fairies,

11:51.184 --> 11:53.885
and while they are crafty negotiators,

11:53.887 --> 11:56.120
they're not thieves.

11:56.122 --> 11:59.157
If they have our citizens' gold,

11:59.159 --> 12:01.159
perhaps it's from a misunderstanding

12:01.161 --> 12:03.328
that can be worked out diplomatically.

12:03.330 --> 12:05.997
Payments are due no later
than tomorrow's sunset.

12:05.999 --> 12:07.565
I'm quite aware.

12:07.567 --> 12:09.167
And diplomacy...

12:09.169 --> 12:11.803
Can always be followed by force,

12:11.805 --> 12:14.106
but the reverse is rarely true.

12:16.009 --> 12:17.642
Okay.

12:17.644 --> 12:20.478
I get the charisma. His intelligence.

12:20.480 --> 12:22.513
- He's royal but down to Earth.
- Yeah, it's true.

12:22.515 --> 12:24.115
- It works.
- Mm-hmm.

12:24.117 --> 12:26.217
But trust him?

12:26.219 --> 12:28.152
Truly?

12:28.154 --> 12:30.255
We need five pounds of gold by tomorrow

12:30.257 --> 12:32.423
and another 15 by the week's end,

12:32.425 --> 12:35.361
or the life of every
Fillorian is in peril.

12:38.231 --> 12:40.031
Accompany Pickwick.

12:40.033 --> 12:41.799
If you find the fairies' encampment,

12:41.801 --> 12:44.202
you have one hour to negotiate.

12:44.204 --> 12:46.304
If that fails,

12:46.306 --> 12:48.714
you'll stand down and let the Centurions

12:48.716 --> 12:50.575
do whatever is necessary.

12:50.577 --> 12:53.077
I trust your wisdom, sire.

13:01.688 --> 13:04.222
Whoa! Hey, easy.

13:04.224 --> 13:05.590
I'm High King Margo.

13:05.592 --> 13:07.362
We were all pals back in the day.

13:07.364 --> 13:09.299
Oh, we know who you are.

13:10.463 --> 13:12.397
Look, my friend was
supposed to find you.

13:12.399 --> 13:14.400
- I think we can help each other.
- Margo?

13:16.569 --> 13:18.904
It's okay, Rowan. She's with me.

13:26.834 --> 13:29.135
Ugh.

13:29.137 --> 13:31.504
If that's from the selkie
in the east fountain,

13:31.506 --> 13:33.606
you might want to get
tested for the clap.

13:33.608 --> 13:36.309
Holy shit, am I glad to see you.

13:36.311 --> 13:37.957
How'd you get out of the Etheric Realm?

13:37.959 --> 13:39.345
Long story.

13:39.347 --> 13:41.514
Point is, I heard your call.

13:41.516 --> 13:43.516
I'm here, and yes,

13:43.518 --> 13:45.552
I could use a goddamn drink.

13:46.955 --> 13:50.089
- Weren't you sober?
- Ah, yes.

13:50.091 --> 13:51.958
Right, well,

13:51.960 --> 13:54.293
the Etheric Realm was a lot.

13:56.597 --> 13:58.464
Let's find a bottle,

13:58.466 --> 14:00.534
and you can fill me in.

14:01.636 --> 14:03.102
Okay.

14:08.009 --> 14:11.077
The traveler professor who cannot travel

14:11.079 --> 14:14.347
is now the Acting Dean.

14:14.349 --> 14:16.148
Students are blowing themselves up,

14:16.150 --> 14:18.484
and I presume

14:18.486 --> 14:22.488
you are the aforementioned
"assholes who moved the moon".

14:22.490 --> 14:25.124
Yes, but I found a workaround.

14:25.126 --> 14:28.580
If you cast as if your
altitude is 1,000 feet lower

14:28.582 --> 14:31.197
and the Pleiades are six
degrees further to the north,

14:31.199 --> 14:33.033
well, then...

14:35.136 --> 14:37.069
Ah.

14:37.071 --> 14:38.958
If we apply this tweak to every spell,

14:38.960 --> 14:41.941
we can teach people to
cast without exploding

14:41.943 --> 14:44.577
or turning things into chickens.

14:44.579 --> 14:46.545
What happened to your hand?

14:46.547 --> 14:49.148
I thought the Etheric Realm
was supposed to be a fun trip.

14:49.150 --> 14:51.083
Yes.

14:51.085 --> 14:52.952
Leaving it, less so,

14:52.954 --> 14:55.121
but I had no choice.

14:55.123 --> 14:56.904
I couldn't risk anyone else getting hurt

14:56.906 --> 14:58.807
by the security system I built.

15:00.395 --> 15:02.461
Yes, I can deactivate it,

15:02.463 --> 15:05.165
and I will need the master key, please.

15:07.235 --> 15:09.101
- Thank you.
- Whoa, hold up, hold up.

15:09.103 --> 15:11.879
I still got student problems
to put on your radar.

15:11.881 --> 15:14.573
Penny, I have to go
save hundreds of lives.

15:14.575 --> 15:17.444
I think you can handle
a few whiny students.

15:18.546 --> 15:21.081
See? Delegating!

15:22.216 --> 15:25.051
Look, we got a common enemy here.

15:25.053 --> 15:26.285
The Dark King's goons

15:26.287 --> 15:27.995
are itching to make your life hell.

15:27.997 --> 15:30.523
We've always dealt with hostile humans.

15:30.525 --> 15:32.458
Yeah, well, this one's got an army.

15:32.460 --> 15:33.582
In which you serve.

15:33.584 --> 15:36.053
I'm undercover so I can
get information on him,

15:36.055 --> 15:38.112
which we could be sharing
with each other right now

15:38.114 --> 15:40.255
if you'd just set your
motherfucker to receive.

15:40.257 --> 15:42.424
Okay, let's dial it down, guys.

15:42.426 --> 15:43.825
We're all friends here.

15:43.827 --> 15:45.494
Forgive my bluntness, Fen,

15:45.496 --> 15:47.195
but your choice of friends

15:47.197 --> 15:48.730
makes me doubt our choice of ally.

15:48.732 --> 15:50.565
Maybe you're too young
or dumb to remember,

15:50.567 --> 15:52.868
but I'm the king who made
peace with your people.

15:52.870 --> 15:54.369
Is that what you think you did?

15:54.371 --> 15:55.371
Yeah.

15:56.707 --> 15:57.807
Rowan, wait.

16:00.177 --> 16:01.543
Okay, what does she think I did?

16:01.545 --> 16:04.813
Well, very few fairies who
knew you are still alive today,

16:04.815 --> 16:08.283
and the rest just know the
story of High King Margo,

16:08.285 --> 16:09.985
which, over the centuries,

16:09.987 --> 16:13.288
shifted with each retelling.

16:13.290 --> 16:15.691
So I'm being boned by a
giant game of telephone.

16:15.693 --> 16:16.825
No, no, no, no, no.

16:16.827 --> 16:18.527
Phone games are fun...
this, not so much.

16:18.529 --> 16:22.531
See, you say you made peace.

16:22.533 --> 16:24.433
They say you destroyed their realm

16:24.435 --> 16:26.335
and allowed fairy hunts for sport.

16:26.337 --> 16:28.370
It's a real "potato, potahto".

16:28.372 --> 16:30.839
No, it's "potato,
po-massive-fucking-lie".

16:30.841 --> 16:33.909
Look, I found them, gained their trust.

16:33.911 --> 16:38.647
You think that was easy for me
after what happened to my baby?

16:38.649 --> 16:40.382
But I did it.

16:40.384 --> 16:43.819
And then you barrel in and
just completely screw the pooch.

16:43.821 --> 16:46.655
- And not in a good way.
- Okay.

16:46.657 --> 16:48.390
You know what? You're right.

16:48.392 --> 16:51.760
I... uh, yeah.

16:51.762 --> 16:53.061
I am.

16:53.063 --> 16:56.631
But now the fairies
need to trust us both.

16:56.633 --> 16:58.768
How can I help make that happen?

16:59.937 --> 17:01.504
You won't like it.

17:08.945 --> 17:10.847
Oh, that's not right.

17:13.416 --> 17:16.550
I know what I'm doing,
if you don't mind.

17:16.553 --> 17:17.819
It's a mistake.

17:17.820 --> 17:19.788
For sure.

17:19.790 --> 17:22.057
I'm correcting spells
for the new Circumstances.

17:22.059 --> 17:24.792
It's math. I don't
make mistakes at math.

17:24.795 --> 17:27.061
No, I mean,

17:27.064 --> 17:29.831
that is a spell for
cooking without a fire,

17:29.833 --> 17:31.933
but for real...

17:31.935 --> 17:33.935
that's gonna be a pretty terrible steak.

17:33.937 --> 17:36.972
You need flame to denature the proteins.

17:36.974 --> 17:38.907
What do I know, though?

17:38.909 --> 17:40.275
You a teacher here?

17:40.277 --> 17:41.376
We could be colleagues.

17:41.378 --> 17:43.845
I'm interviewing for the botany job.

17:43.847 --> 17:45.515
Hamish Bax.

17:46.717 --> 17:48.950
Alice Quinn.

17:48.952 --> 17:51.086
Not related to Stephanie Quinn,

17:51.088 --> 17:52.288
are you?

17:53.590 --> 17:56.625
We met at a rare flower expo.

17:56.627 --> 17:59.995
I found her orchid quite impressive.

17:59.997 --> 18:01.797
Oh, God.

18:01.799 --> 18:04.032
No. No, nothing like that.

18:04.034 --> 18:06.869
I would never date another botanist.

18:10.607 --> 18:12.874
Wait. Shit.

18:12.876 --> 18:15.578
I don't understand. My fix was working.

18:16.814 --> 18:19.581
According to Todd's napkins, there are,

18:19.583 --> 18:25.520
"evil forces coming from
a distant realm to invade".

18:25.522 --> 18:27.789
You think this is enough to go on?

18:27.791 --> 18:30.025
Well, Fillory was overrun
by these Taker creatures,

18:30.027 --> 18:31.993
so it's gotta be them.

18:31.995 --> 18:34.029
So you're going?

18:34.031 --> 18:36.631
- I could use your help.
- I could use yours.

18:38.502 --> 18:41.369
Fogg's back.

18:41.371 --> 18:43.872
You didn't even want to be a professor.

18:43.874 --> 18:45.774
We're talking about the
fate of an entire world.

18:45.776 --> 18:47.108
Didn't we just do this, though?

18:48.211 --> 18:50.412
One minute, it's the
Harmonic Convergence,

18:50.414 --> 18:52.447
then it's the moon, and now Fillory?

18:52.449 --> 18:55.083
- Can't we just...
- Sit back and relax?

18:55.085 --> 18:56.685
- No, but...
- Come on, Penny.

18:56.687 --> 18:58.019
Look, you know what I'm after.

18:58.021 --> 19:00.722
A life with you,

19:00.724 --> 19:02.157
here or wherever, honestly.

19:02.159 --> 19:03.419
Why not Fillory?

19:03.421 --> 19:06.394
Because not every
apocalypse is our problem.

19:06.396 --> 19:09.197
We just survived the last one by a hair,

19:09.199 --> 19:10.866
and what is it all for
if we can't kick back

19:10.868 --> 19:12.601
on a beach somewhere and enjoy it?

19:12.603 --> 19:14.569
Let me tell you something.

19:14.571 --> 19:18.173
The world doesn't wait
for timing to be right.

19:18.175 --> 19:20.076
I want to know how long I've gotta wait.

19:21.078 --> 19:24.679
You live to 35, and
then you get to be done?

19:24.681 --> 19:26.983
Or is this forever?

19:29.052 --> 19:30.785
I get you need magic
to mean something...

19:30.787 --> 19:32.554
Oh, I see what this is.

19:32.556 --> 19:34.155
You think it's some irrational reaction

19:34.157 --> 19:35.724
to my best friend dying, and eventually,

19:35.726 --> 19:37.393
I'll just get over it?

19:38.562 --> 19:40.795
Well, your math was right before.

19:40.797 --> 19:42.731
Okay, but it's definitely not now.

19:42.733 --> 19:43.932
I don't know why, but I think

19:43.934 --> 19:46.902
the Circumstances just changed again.

19:46.904 --> 19:48.904
Oh, shit. I told Fogg it was safe.

19:48.906 --> 19:51.039
If he tries to use my
fix, and it backfires...

19:51.041 --> 19:52.607
I have to warn him

19:52.609 --> 19:55.010
before he tries to disable
the security system.

20:03.887 --> 20:06.088
Julia, I'm not judging you.

20:06.858 --> 20:08.581
You're allowed to
grieve however you want.

20:08.583 --> 20:09.591
Thank you for your permission.

20:09.593 --> 20:11.593
Yeah, but the shit
you do affects me too.

20:11.595 --> 20:13.194
I think I can't do what I need to do

20:13.196 --> 20:15.497
if I'm worried about how
it's gonna affect you.

20:15.499 --> 20:17.666
Worried about me? I'm worried about you.

20:17.668 --> 20:19.935
Yeah. That's the problem.

20:19.937 --> 20:21.169
So...

20:21.171 --> 20:23.105
what are you saying?

20:24.141 --> 20:25.675
I think we need to be done.

20:34.222 --> 20:36.545
Emergency protocols are active.

20:36.547 --> 20:37.886
The hell?

20:37.888 --> 20:39.554
For your own safety,
please stay in place

20:39.556 --> 20:42.090
and await instructions.

20:42.092 --> 20:44.593
Emergency protocols are active.

20:44.595 --> 20:45.660
For your own safety,

20:45.662 --> 20:49.864
please stay in place
and await instructions.

20:49.866 --> 20:52.534
Emergency protocols are active.

20:52.536 --> 20:53.635
For your own safety,

20:53.637 --> 20:57.706
please stay in place
and await instructions.

20:57.708 --> 20:58.873
Emergency protocols...

20:58.875 --> 21:00.875
Looks like you're not
going to Fillory after all.

21:00.877 --> 21:03.245
For your own safety,
please stay in place...

21:10.961 --> 21:13.640
Look, I really thought I
was doing the right thing.

21:13.642 --> 21:15.275
By robbing us of our homeland?

21:15.277 --> 21:16.343
By giving you a place

21:16.345 --> 21:18.812
where you and your weird
mushroom eggs could survive.

21:18.814 --> 21:21.982
You promised sanctuary
and left us vulnerable.

21:21.984 --> 21:24.618
When your people persecuted us

21:24.620 --> 21:26.920
because we had no way
to defend ourselves,

21:26.922 --> 21:29.323
you abandoned us.

21:29.325 --> 21:31.959
And you can understand

21:31.961 --> 21:34.962
how that would make the
fairies feel, can't you, Margo?

21:34.964 --> 21:36.163
Okay, yeah, of course

21:36.165 --> 21:38.265
I'm sorry you went through that,

21:38.267 --> 21:39.700
but it was after my reign ended.

21:39.702 --> 21:41.134
You really think that justifies

21:41.136 --> 21:42.703
the harm you set into motion?

21:42.705 --> 21:44.871
Jesus.

21:44.873 --> 21:46.907
You step out for 300 goddamn years,

21:46.909 --> 21:48.208
and a bunch of gossip girls

21:48.210 --> 21:50.077
turn your whole life
into the Nuremberg trials?

21:50.079 --> 21:51.134
Margo.

21:51.136 --> 21:54.715
Look, this diplomatic milk
bath is all very kabuki,

21:54.717 --> 21:56.717
but let me tell you
what my dad always said.

21:56.719 --> 21:58.819
"You can't fix stupid".

21:58.821 --> 22:00.687
Skipping past the fact
he always said it to me,

22:00.689 --> 22:03.223
I'll add, I'm not the problem here,

22:03.225 --> 22:06.126
and if you don't work with me
to bring down the Dark King,

22:06.128 --> 22:08.095
you're Olympic-gold-medal stupid.

22:08.097 --> 22:10.797
- Ember's balls, Margo.
- Get out.

22:13.002 --> 22:15.869
Bick coming! Run, hide!

22:17.706 --> 22:20.079
Emergency protocols are active.

22:20.081 --> 22:22.242
Dean. Dean!

22:22.244 --> 22:25.012
And await instructions.

22:25.014 --> 22:28.115
Emergency protocols are active.

22:28.117 --> 22:30.318
- Penny.
- The hell is going on?

22:32.421 --> 22:34.755
I'm afraid Alice's
circumstantial mediation

22:34.757 --> 22:36.089
didn't work.

22:36.091 --> 22:37.791
When I tried to shut
down the security system,

22:37.793 --> 22:40.694
it set off all the
school's defenses at once.

22:40.696 --> 22:43.263
- And you can't shut it down?
- I'm trying.

22:43.265 --> 22:45.732
In the meanwhile, I
strongly suggest you stay put

22:45.734 --> 22:48.902
so you don't get blown
up and sprayed with acid,

22:48.904 --> 22:51.738
eaten by centipedes, or turned into one.

22:51.740 --> 22:53.741
This is a school.

22:54.710 --> 22:56.743
Hey, got most of it,
but we still need to...

22:56.745 --> 22:58.278
Yes, I know what we need. Let's go.

22:58.280 --> 22:59.880
Well, how can we help?

22:59.882 --> 23:01.381
Stay put.

23:01.383 --> 23:03.150
Eliot and I have it covered.

23:03.152 --> 23:05.053
You mean Todd?

23:05.921 --> 23:08.455
Y... yes. Of course.

23:08.457 --> 23:09.956
Isn't that what I said?

23:09.958 --> 23:11.825
Oh, wait, Todd.

23:11.827 --> 23:13.663
I just had a quick question,

23:13.665 --> 23:15.295
uh, about something the Pig Man said.

23:15.297 --> 23:16.797
Of course, yeah.

23:16.799 --> 23:19.866
Which professor's Pig Man?

23:19.868 --> 23:23.370
The Pig Man. From Fillory?

23:23.372 --> 23:25.839
- What about him?
- Todd!

23:25.841 --> 23:27.775
Sorry, gotta bounce.

23:29.878 --> 23:33.246
You saw that, right?

23:33.248 --> 23:35.449
He had no clue what I was talking about.

23:35.451 --> 23:38.051
It's Todd. He's always clueless.

23:38.053 --> 23:40.487
No, I'm telling you something's up.

23:40.489 --> 23:44.091
I mean, Fogg's acting off, too, right?

23:44.093 --> 23:46.827
The drinking, the burns on his hands.

23:46.829 --> 23:49.096
I just figured the Etheric
Realm did a number on him.

23:49.098 --> 23:52.899
You saw what Todd was
carrying, too, right?

23:52.901 --> 23:57.204
I mean, Azurite, Bondoc
Prisms, beech ash.

23:57.206 --> 23:59.806
That's all reserved for Major Arcana.

23:59.808 --> 24:04.177
Or they could just be trying
to fix the security spells.

24:04.179 --> 24:05.779
We should follow them.

24:05.781 --> 24:08.724
And get turned into
centipedes or whatever?

24:08.726 --> 24:10.350
No, thanks.

24:10.352 --> 24:11.918
Also, no offense,

24:11.920 --> 24:13.353
rather not be around you right now.

24:13.355 --> 24:15.222
What? Yeah, cool.

24:15.224 --> 24:18.091
Okay, stay here by
yourself. I... I'm gonna go.

24:18.093 --> 24:19.893
And get turned into a centipede.

24:19.895 --> 24:21.028
Fuck.

24:23.296 --> 24:25.553
Well, this is definitely the
most exciting job interview

24:25.555 --> 24:27.901
I've ever been on.

24:27.903 --> 24:30.337
I don't understand why you're
still hoping to reach Fogg.

24:30.339 --> 24:33.440
He clearly tried your casting
tweak, and it backfired.

24:33.442 --> 24:35.287
Why we're trapped here
in the first place?

24:35.289 --> 24:36.777
Well, if he's trying to fix it,

24:36.779 --> 24:39.112
he'll need to understand how
to adjust our current situation.

24:39.114 --> 24:40.369
I'm getting the sense

24:40.371 --> 24:42.516
you're not a fan of
things you can't calculate.

24:42.518 --> 24:44.495
I'm starting to see why
you spend all your time

24:44.497 --> 24:46.354
around plants.

24:54.463 --> 24:56.296
Shit.

24:56.298 --> 24:58.498
How do the Circumstances keep changing?

24:58.500 --> 25:00.434
Look, what do you say
we forget the note,

25:00.436 --> 25:03.303
take down those wards, and
go find the Dean ourselves?

25:03.305 --> 25:05.172
We can't even cast properly.

25:05.174 --> 25:08.875
Undoing a spell doesn't
require the same rigor.

25:08.877 --> 25:12.412
It's like pulling up a
weed with a deep taproot.

25:12.414 --> 25:16.417
Just need to get under it
at the right point, and...

25:18.220 --> 25:19.787
Voilà.

25:26.528 --> 25:28.462
Okay.

25:28.464 --> 25:31.531
Okay, maybe I'm just paying
for that botanist's confidence.

25:31.533 --> 25:33.233
I don't think I should
try a healing spell.

25:33.235 --> 25:34.667
I think it might make things worse.

25:34.669 --> 25:35.902
Infirmary?

25:35.904 --> 25:37.370
That's all the way across campus.

25:37.372 --> 25:40.407
Okay, um, can we make
it to the greenhouse?

25:40.409 --> 25:43.411
There might be something
there I can use.

25:48.417 --> 25:51.151
They were just here.

25:51.153 --> 25:52.987
Someone must've warned them.

25:55.237 --> 25:57.105
Search the tents.

26:26.355 --> 26:27.988
Hey.

26:27.990 --> 26:30.090
Didn't you hear the
order? Check the tents.

26:30.092 --> 26:32.260
- Now.
- Okay.

26:35.030 --> 26:36.531
Go.

26:42.871 --> 26:45.139
Well, well. Look what I found.

26:46.575 --> 26:48.241
He planted that.

26:48.243 --> 26:50.143
He planted that gold like a bad cop,

26:50.145 --> 26:52.646
like that show you... like
Vic Mackey on "The Shield".

26:52.648 --> 26:56.316
You were lecturing me on
the true nature of fairies?

26:56.318 --> 26:58.451
They've changed,

26:58.453 --> 27:00.154
it would appear.

27:02.357 --> 27:06.927
Janet of House Pluchinsky,
what are you doing here?

27:06.929 --> 27:08.562
Been with you guys the whole time.

27:08.564 --> 27:10.063
Jesus.

27:10.065 --> 27:13.133
Women are just invisible
to you, aren't they, sir?

27:13.135 --> 27:15.068
Congratulations, Bick.

27:15.070 --> 27:17.437
Now, shouldn't we get
this gold back to our king

27:17.439 --> 27:19.973
as soon as possible?

27:19.975 --> 27:22.676
We'll hunt the fairies down another day

27:22.678 --> 27:25.345
and no doubt find more gold.

27:25.347 --> 27:28.215
Centurions, back to Whitespire.

27:31.019 --> 27:33.554
- Thanks for the heads up.
- You're welcome.

27:48.203 --> 27:49.369
- Careful.
- Oh, Jesus.

27:49.371 --> 27:50.371
Land mines.

27:54.676 --> 27:56.910
Oh. Hey, guys.

27:56.912 --> 28:00.146
Um, aren't you supposed
to be on lockdown?

28:00.148 --> 28:02.415
Wanted to help. What you up to?

28:02.417 --> 28:04.250
Ah, nothing.

28:04.252 --> 28:06.453
Just, like, getting supplies.

28:06.455 --> 28:09.322
That's cinnabar.
That shit's pretty toxic.

28:09.324 --> 28:10.423
- Mm-hmm.
- No.

28:10.425 --> 28:14.007
This is, um, cinna... mon.

28:14.009 --> 28:15.164
Cinnamon?

28:15.166 --> 28:18.732
How's cinnamon gonna help
with the security system?

28:18.734 --> 28:20.753
Dean Fogg asked if I could...

28:20.755 --> 28:22.413
Why you acting so squirrely?

28:22.415 --> 28:24.170
Why are you acting so squirrely?

28:24.172 --> 28:26.473
I always act this way, okay?

28:26.475 --> 28:27.859
You know, whatever.

28:27.861 --> 28:32.078
I have to get this for Fogg...
to Fogg, because of the...

28:32.080 --> 28:33.613
for his toast, I don't know.

28:33.615 --> 28:35.916
Wait, careful! There are land mines.

28:36.922 --> 28:38.189
Thank you.

28:40.255 --> 28:42.422
Holy shit!

28:46.461 --> 28:48.328
Oh, my God.

28:48.330 --> 28:50.665
Did I just die?

28:59.909 --> 29:01.242
Here.

29:04.580 --> 29:07.548
You see anything we
can use for an antidote?

29:07.550 --> 29:09.783
Is there a section for healing herbs?

29:09.785 --> 29:11.498
Uh...

29:11.500 --> 29:14.123
Look for variants of
plantago lanceolata.

29:14.125 --> 29:15.125
Okay.

29:17.128 --> 29:18.561
Hey, I found it.

29:18.563 --> 29:21.397
Okay, you need to make a
poultice from the leaves.

29:28.506 --> 29:30.373
That blossom...

29:30.375 --> 29:32.308
it's from a different world.

29:32.310 --> 29:34.010
It shouldn't even be able to grow here.

29:34.012 --> 29:35.177
Why not?

29:35.179 --> 29:37.380
Different Circumstances.

29:38.550 --> 29:42.084
Everyone thought she'd
died before she cracked it.

29:42.086 --> 29:43.786
What are you talking about?

29:43.788 --> 29:46.766
Ahh.

29:46.768 --> 29:49.191
Your late Exo-Botony
professor was working on

29:49.193 --> 29:52.695
a sort of terrarium for magical plants.

29:52.697 --> 29:54.330
They don't need just water or light.

29:54.332 --> 29:57.234
They require specific
Circumstances to survive.

30:00.071 --> 30:02.204
That's to make the Circumstances match

30:02.206 --> 30:04.174
to any growing conditions.

30:05.076 --> 30:07.276
Moon, body of water, altitude.

30:07.278 --> 30:08.644
Holy shit. I think you're right.

30:08.646 --> 30:10.246
Mm.

30:10.248 --> 30:11.781
Wait, wait, wait!
You might kill the flower.

30:11.783 --> 30:14.084
Yeah, or find the fix for magic.

30:38.209 --> 30:39.408
Wow. That actually worked.

30:39.410 --> 30:41.577
Just shut up for a second.

30:41.579 --> 30:43.113
What is it?

30:44.148 --> 30:47.183
If Fogg gets my note,

30:47.185 --> 30:50.152
I might actually be
able to fix this mess.

30:50.154 --> 30:54.356
So other Todd tied you up
and locked you in a closet?

30:54.358 --> 30:57.059
Yeah, but I've never
been great with knots,

30:57.061 --> 30:59.795
so it was pretty easy for me to escape.

30:59.797 --> 31:03.699
Only question is, why would evil twin me

31:03.701 --> 31:06.435
wanna get rid of me in the first place?

31:06.437 --> 31:08.804
Of course.

31:08.806 --> 31:10.339
"Evil".

31:10.341 --> 31:11.807
He wasn't your twin.

31:11.809 --> 31:13.342
I think he's from another timeline.

31:13.344 --> 31:15.611
- Wait, for realsies?
- No, it... it adds up.

31:15.613 --> 31:17.613
You know, the two Todds plus cinnabar,

31:17.615 --> 31:20.382
which last time I saw, was
being used for time magic.

31:20.384 --> 31:22.852
I always wanted to meet
someone from another timeline.

31:22.854 --> 31:24.086
Wait a minute, guys.

31:24.088 --> 31:27.857
What if Dean Fogg isn't our Fogg?

31:27.859 --> 31:29.917
Describe him. I transcribed his memoir.

31:29.919 --> 31:31.227
I know all 40 Foggs.

31:31.229 --> 31:32.722
Even got nicknames for some of them.

31:32.724 --> 31:34.230
Fedora Fogg,

31:34.232 --> 31:36.298
Cocaine Fogg, Swinger Fogg...

31:36.300 --> 31:38.500
actually, those last
two are the same Fogg.

31:38.502 --> 31:40.703
Uh, well, this one's a heavy drinker.

31:40.705 --> 31:42.204
No, that doesn't really narrow it down.

31:42.206 --> 31:43.305
Okay. He has burns on his hands.

31:43.307 --> 31:45.174
He calls you... other you "Eliot".

31:45.176 --> 31:47.109
- He has...
- Ohh.

31:47.111 --> 31:48.478
Poop.

31:49.413 --> 31:50.413
What?

31:51.582 --> 31:53.782
I call that one Psycho Fogg.

31:53.784 --> 31:57.453
See, in timeline 17,
Brakebills kinda blew up.

31:57.455 --> 31:59.221
Killed almost everybody.

31:59.223 --> 32:01.290
And those burns on Fogg's hands...

32:01.292 --> 32:03.492
They're kinda 'cause
he's the one who did it.

32:03.494 --> 32:05.027
Well, what would he be doing here?

32:05.029 --> 32:06.328
Psycho Fogg?

32:06.330 --> 32:08.264
Let's not wait to find out, okay?

32:08.266 --> 32:10.200
- Let's go.
- Ah, okay.

32:14.871 --> 32:17.090
Just over six pounds.

32:17.092 --> 32:19.337
Enough to mollify the
soldiers and workers

32:19.339 --> 32:20.842
for tonight, at least.

32:20.844 --> 32:22.831
You're confident you can retrieve more?

32:22.833 --> 32:25.300
No, sire.

32:25.302 --> 32:27.936
Certain.

32:27.938 --> 32:30.505
Ugh.

32:30.507 --> 32:32.307
Mm.

32:32.309 --> 32:35.678
Smells like... shit.

32:37.281 --> 32:38.880
I don't control where the fairies hide

32:38.882 --> 32:40.515
their stolen wealth.

32:40.517 --> 32:43.252
Well, as long as it pays like gold.

33:13.884 --> 33:16.485
This scalawag is so Vic Mackey.

33:16.487 --> 33:18.720
Gold-shitting beetles.

33:18.722 --> 33:22.357
Everybody said they've been
extinct for hundreds of years.

33:22.359 --> 33:24.968
- A rumor started by the Pickwicks, I bet.
- Hmm.

33:24.970 --> 33:27.227
I think we're looking at
a little family secret.

33:30.334 --> 33:32.701
Thank God I got your note in time.

33:32.703 --> 33:34.503
I think we might be able
to actually shut down

33:34.505 --> 33:36.271
this goddamn security system.

33:36.273 --> 33:38.740
If I'm right, this should
adjust Circumstances

33:38.742 --> 33:40.942
in the entire greenhouse,

33:40.944 --> 33:42.811
allowing us to cast.

33:42.813 --> 33:44.947
Let's test it first, shall we?

33:49.820 --> 33:51.319
Not bad, Quinn.

33:51.321 --> 33:53.722
- Can we fix the lockdown now?
- I think so.

33:53.724 --> 33:55.891
I just need one last thing from Todd.

33:55.893 --> 33:58.627
Cinnabar, right? Todd couldn't make it.

33:58.629 --> 34:01.329
Sorry.

34:01.331 --> 34:03.765
- What's going on?
- Fogg's not who he says he is.

34:03.767 --> 34:04.923
So who is he?

34:04.925 --> 34:06.968
He's Dean Fogg from timeline 17.

34:06.970 --> 34:08.870
Lockdown wasn't an accident, was it?

34:08.871 --> 34:10.072
You made it happen.

34:10.074 --> 34:11.672
Perhaps I did.

34:11.675 --> 34:13.476
Ah!

34:14.911 --> 34:17.446
Take one more step,

34:17.447 --> 34:19.447
and I will hurt them.

34:19.449 --> 34:22.384
Now, please.

34:22.386 --> 34:24.485
Hand me the cinnabar.

34:24.487 --> 34:25.853
What are you gonna do with it?

34:25.856 --> 34:28.389
I'm going to fix things.

34:28.391 --> 34:29.824
I've seen that thing before.

34:29.827 --> 34:31.426
That's the device Stoppard built

34:31.428 --> 34:32.694
to travel between timelines.

34:32.696 --> 34:35.397
Yes, I took it from him to get here,

34:35.399 --> 34:37.099
then made a few modifications.

34:37.101 --> 34:39.534
Enough to take all of
Brakebills back home

34:39.536 --> 34:41.904
with me.

34:48.203 --> 34:50.070
Whoa, listen. Hey.

34:50.072 --> 34:51.371
Look, I get it.

34:51.373 --> 34:53.940
My timeline was a mess also,

34:53.942 --> 34:57.444
but you have a Brakebills
here with no Fogg.

34:57.446 --> 34:59.179
Why don't you just stay?

35:02.417 --> 35:05.379
Penny. Sure.

35:05.381 --> 35:06.837
When things start go wrong,

35:06.839 --> 35:09.039
just fuck off to the next timeline.

35:09.041 --> 35:10.874
How very appropriate.

35:10.876 --> 35:13.810
But didn't you destroy your
Brakebills, and everyone died?

35:13.812 --> 35:16.079
Yes, a measure I took to try to contain

35:16.081 --> 35:18.782
the damage The Beast could do.

35:18.784 --> 35:20.450
And when that failed,

35:20.452 --> 35:22.953
Jane Chatwin got to go
to the next time loop

35:22.955 --> 35:24.654
while I had to stay behind

35:24.656 --> 35:27.157
and live with the goddamn consequences.

35:27.159 --> 35:30.127
Your timeline continued
even though Jane reset it?

35:30.129 --> 35:31.194
Yes, dear.

35:31.196 --> 35:33.597
Were you dropped on your
head in this timeline?

35:33.599 --> 35:36.867
You should be well familiar
with the multiverse hypothesis.

35:36.869 --> 35:38.468
As it turns out,

35:38.470 --> 35:40.904
one of the goddamn
consequences is I discovered

35:40.906 --> 35:43.206
I have a grown daughter currently living

35:43.208 --> 35:46.109
in my post-apocalyptic
shitshow of a timeline

35:46.111 --> 35:48.912
with hardly any living
Magicians and no resources.

35:48.914 --> 35:51.448
I need this Brakebills

35:51.450 --> 35:54.084
and everyone in it to
fix where I came from.

35:54.086 --> 35:58.455
You cannot uproot
everyone in this timeline

35:58.457 --> 36:00.023
just to be a good dad, okay?

36:00.025 --> 36:02.626
Watch me.

36:02.628 --> 36:05.195
Fucking father of the year!

36:05.197 --> 36:08.198
Penny, if you're smart,

36:08.200 --> 36:12.068
you will hand me that
cinnabar and join me.

36:12.070 --> 36:14.104
Doesn't sound too smart to me.

36:14.106 --> 36:17.474
Well, you can't travel anymore, yes?

36:18.644 --> 36:20.143
I know a psychic in my timeline

36:20.145 --> 36:21.545
who might be able to fix you.

36:21.547 --> 36:25.015
Her specialty is
unlocking latent abilities.

36:25.017 --> 36:27.250
She's done extensive
studies on travelers.

36:27.252 --> 36:29.986
And I'm fucking her.

36:29.988 --> 36:30.988
Heh.

36:34.826 --> 36:36.226
Penny.

36:36.228 --> 36:38.228
You're not actually considering...

36:38.230 --> 36:40.597
And get my GPS fixed?

36:40.599 --> 36:42.699
Why not?

36:42.701 --> 36:47.137
Because everyone in this
timeline deserves a Brakebills.

36:47.139 --> 36:49.941
Yeah, well, I'm not from this timeline.

36:52.110 --> 36:53.978
Wait. Dean Fogg, no!

37:11.029 --> 37:13.530
God damn it.

37:13.532 --> 37:14.698
What happened?

37:14.700 --> 37:16.566
That cinnabar we gave you?

37:16.568 --> 37:18.101
We swapped it out for cinnamon.

37:18.103 --> 37:20.270
Doesn't play too nice with time magic.

37:20.272 --> 37:22.673
We actually got the idea
from Todd, uh, before he...

37:24.109 --> 37:27.010
You know what? Never mind.

37:27.012 --> 37:29.213
Now how 'bout you show us
how to lift that lockdown?

37:33.051 --> 37:34.851
The smell is how you knew?

37:34.853 --> 37:37.687
I'd read about the
beetles who excreted gold,

37:37.689 --> 37:41.891
but we were all told they
disappeared generations ago.

37:41.893 --> 37:43.193
Surprisingly,

37:43.195 --> 37:46.563
Bick's all about saving
endangered species.

37:46.565 --> 37:49.599
Ridiculous, sire.

37:49.601 --> 37:52.002
Your apartments have
already been searched, Bick.

37:52.004 --> 37:55.071
Obviously, the fairies
never had any gold,

37:55.073 --> 37:57.040
and Bick never had any
reason to hate them.

37:58.910 --> 38:01.344
They are not Fillorian.

38:01.346 --> 38:02.879
That's reason enough.

38:02.881 --> 38:06.016
You'd have had their
innocent blood on my hands?

38:06.018 --> 38:08.785
What fairy is innocent?

38:08.787 --> 38:11.755
Um, all of them.

38:13.225 --> 38:16.326
Sire, please, please.
Thi... this is outrageous.

38:16.328 --> 38:18.728
Be reasonable!

38:18.730 --> 38:20.697
That was satisfying.

38:20.699 --> 38:22.165
I'm so sorry.

38:22.167 --> 38:23.333
That can't have been easy.

38:23.335 --> 38:25.602
I know how much you trusted him.

38:25.604 --> 38:29.172
No, thank you...

38:29.174 --> 38:32.209
for bringing a little
honesty to this castle.

38:35.247 --> 38:38.748
Bick didn't make Seb dark.

38:38.750 --> 38:40.817
He is dark.

38:40.819 --> 38:42.919
I like him, okay?

38:42.921 --> 38:45.622
Maybe I like him because
I hope he's not fucked up.

38:45.624 --> 38:49.125
Maybe I like him because I hope he is,

38:49.127 --> 38:51.261
because I am too.

38:51.263 --> 38:53.096
Maybe all I deserve is fucked up.

38:53.098 --> 38:55.332
When you think that way,
it's all you'll ever get.

38:55.334 --> 38:57.067
Why do you care so much?

38:57.069 --> 38:59.903
What? I don't.

38:59.905 --> 39:01.705
But what happens to you happens to me,

39:01.707 --> 39:04.308
and I don't want him happening to me.

39:05.877 --> 39:07.878
I know I deserve better.

39:10.749 --> 39:12.649
Wild guess.

39:12.651 --> 39:16.786
Your mother and your father
both loved you unconditionally.

39:16.788 --> 39:19.156
- How did you know?
- How could I not?

39:25.869 --> 39:28.136
What did you do with Fogg 17?

39:28.138 --> 39:29.638
Can't arrest him, can't let him go,

39:29.640 --> 39:31.073
so we put him in the Clean Room.

39:31.075 --> 39:33.742
He can't cast there,
so at least this way,

39:33.744 --> 39:36.078
if there's something else
that goes wrong at Brakebills,

39:36.080 --> 39:38.080
there's a Fogg I can talk to about it.

39:38.082 --> 39:40.115
There's one thing I'm certain of.

39:40.117 --> 39:43.819
Things are absolutely going
to keep going wrong here.

39:43.821 --> 39:46.521
I have a theory why
magic isn't working right.

39:46.523 --> 39:48.190
I've been studying the control panel,

39:48.192 --> 39:50.859
and there's a readout on
prevailing Circumstances

39:50.861 --> 39:52.227
outside the tank, and...

39:52.229 --> 39:55.063
well, the moon was all over the place.

39:55.065 --> 39:56.932
I don't understand. I thought...

39:56.934 --> 39:58.934
I mean, when we fixed the moon,

39:58.936 --> 40:00.268
it was like we never even broke it.

40:00.270 --> 40:02.170
I think the Lunatics were right

40:02.172 --> 40:04.606
and the moon's got
feelings, and apparently,

40:04.608 --> 40:06.659
she's pissed at us.

40:06.661 --> 40:08.795
Great. How do we fix that?

40:10.966 --> 40:12.899
I have no idea, so I'm just gonna

40:12.901 --> 40:15.468
keep studying the control
panel at the green house

40:15.470 --> 40:19.006
and see what solution
I can come up with.

40:19.874 --> 40:21.107
Thank you.

40:21.109 --> 40:22.609
Oh, speaking of,

40:22.611 --> 40:25.111
I hear your botanist
friend is doing better.

40:25.113 --> 40:28.114
Not my friend, just
somebody I helped out.

40:28.116 --> 40:30.917
Okay, well, the hiring
committee gave him an offer,

40:30.919 --> 40:34.487
so you might run into him in Botany Bay.

40:34.489 --> 40:36.489
Oh.

40:36.491 --> 40:38.058
Fucking great.

40:41.529 --> 40:44.931
Yeah, I, um... I should probably go too.

40:44.933 --> 40:47.700
Yeah.

40:47.702 --> 40:48.869
Still going to Fillory?

40:50.005 --> 40:51.938
Somebody's gotta stop the apocalypse.

40:51.940 --> 40:53.906
And it's gotta be you.

40:53.908 --> 40:55.575
Penny.

40:55.577 --> 40:56.977
Just...

41:00.148 --> 41:02.015
In my timeline,

41:02.017 --> 41:04.072
I let you go on a quest
to Fillory without me,

41:04.074 --> 41:05.642
and you never came back.

41:07.055 --> 41:08.988
I'm not that Julia.

41:08.990 --> 41:10.757
I... I know, I'm not...

41:10.759 --> 41:13.593
I didn't just come here
and swap Julias, that's...

41:13.595 --> 41:14.827
you're totally different.

41:14.829 --> 41:16.763
Christ, you have no idea.

41:16.765 --> 41:18.488
The only thing you
for sure have in common

41:18.490 --> 41:19.732
is I could not stop her

41:19.734 --> 41:22.102
when she set her mind
to something either.

41:26.107 --> 41:28.075
I have to do this, Penny.

41:29.110 --> 41:32.612
I know.

41:32.614 --> 41:35.616
I just can't go through that again.

41:38.720 --> 41:40.587
And so here we are.

41:42.123 --> 41:44.625
Here we are.

41:46.628 --> 41:48.896
Be safe, Julia.

41:50.598 --> 41:51.965
Yeah.

42:03.678 --> 42:07.080
As I told Margo, we are deeply grateful.

42:07.082 --> 42:10.183
You risked everything for us.

42:10.185 --> 42:12.753
The least we can do is
to show you the truth.

42:13.955 --> 42:15.656
This way.

44:09.771 --> 44:10.793

- Mm.
