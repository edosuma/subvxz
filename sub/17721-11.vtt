WEBVTT

00:02.000 --> 00:03.708
Erica: Control.

00:03.708 --> 00:05.958
You might call it
a lifelong obsession.

00:05.958 --> 00:08.458
Within a year of birth,
we're already throwing fits,

00:09.333 --> 00:10.958
trying to control everything
and anything

00:10.958 --> 00:12.375
that touches our lives.

00:12.375 --> 00:14.750
- Who's the cutest dude ever?

00:14.750 --> 00:16.166
It's Max.

00:16.166 --> 00:18.166
- He's four weeks.

00:18.166 --> 00:19.750
By now he should've put on
at least three pounds;

00:19.750 --> 00:21.000
he's only put on two and a half.

00:21.000 --> 00:22.500
- Oh, it's just a half a pound
though.

00:22.500 --> 00:25.000
Look at him, he's fine.

00:25.000 --> 00:26.958
Max: (Crying)

00:26.958 --> 00:29.000
- Our addiction to control
starts early,

00:29.000 --> 00:30.458
and it doesn't end there.

00:30.458 --> 00:33.166
The terrible twos,
the teenage years.

00:33.166 --> 00:35.083
Our whole lives are a constant
battle between what we want,

00:36.625 --> 00:38.083
and what stands in our way.

00:38.083 --> 00:40.083
- Breast feeding doesn't
just happen, you know?

00:41.041 --> 00:43.000
I mean, so what if I'm not
feeding him right?

00:43.000 --> 00:44.833
What if he's like...

00:44.833 --> 00:46.250
What if he's starving?
- Hey, look at me.

00:46.250 --> 00:48.041
You're doing a great job.

00:49.583 --> 00:52.875
- Yeah... I'm tired, you know?

00:52.875 --> 00:54.416
Max sleeps all day

00:54.416 --> 00:56.708
and then at night
he just wants to... feed,

00:56.708 --> 00:58.708
like, every hour.

00:58.708 --> 01:01.000
- Jude, sit-sit.

01:01.000 --> 01:03.166
Look, you need a break.
Seriously.

01:03.166 --> 01:04.708
Um, Katie, she's coming to town

01:04.708 --> 01:06.041
for the Author's Festival
on Saturday.

01:06.041 --> 01:07.583
Why don't you come?

01:07.583 --> 01:09.833
You know, get Anthony to be
on little Max detail.

01:09.833 --> 01:11.791
- Can I give you
a tentative yes?
- Of course.

01:11.791 --> 01:13.500
(Max cries lightly)

01:15.333 --> 01:16.791
- Oh my God,
do not look behind you.

01:16.791 --> 01:18.875
- Ah, what's going--

01:18.875 --> 01:20.333
- Oh, hey, Judith,
- Hey!

01:20.333 --> 01:21.791
- Oh, you got Max out. Great.
- Yeah.

01:21.791 --> 01:24.375
- Hello.

01:24.375 --> 01:25.750
Erica? What're you doing down--

01:25.750 --> 01:27.125
- Oh. Yeah.

01:28.791 --> 01:31.291
Hi. Max just dropped
his little teething ring.

01:31.291 --> 01:33.750
- Teething. Ah. Already.

01:33.750 --> 01:35.291
- Growing boy.
- Right.

01:35.291 --> 01:36.958
Well, I better get
my caffeine fix in me

01:36.958 --> 01:38.958
before battling a classroom
full of nine-year-olds.

01:40.750 --> 01:42.208
See you around.

01:42.208 --> 01:43.750
(Max cries)

01:47.875 --> 01:49.916
Julianne: River Rock's annual
Festival of Authors

01:49.916 --> 01:52.916
is one of this city's
primo-events, so...

01:52.916 --> 01:55.291
how is this very important day
shaping up?

01:55.291 --> 01:57.125
Brent.

01:57.125 --> 01:59.208
- Well, we'll kick things off
with a dose of caffeine,

01:59.208 --> 02:01.666
thanks to "The History
of Coffee."

02:01.666 --> 02:03.041
- Wake me up before you go-go.

02:03.041 --> 02:05.208
Mm? And then Katie Atkins

02:05.208 --> 02:07.375
will give us a sneak peek
of her first book,

02:07.375 --> 02:09.000
"The None."
- "The None."

02:09.000 --> 02:11.166
Hmm, what's that again?
Oh right, it's only my favorite

02:11.166 --> 02:13.333
new self help title
of the year.

02:13.333 --> 02:15.541
- And I have great, great
things planned for this,
Julianne, trust me.

02:17.375 --> 02:19.958
- Impress me.
Otherwise this little "foray"

02:19.958 --> 02:21.625
into the world of junior editor?

02:21.625 --> 02:23.958
More like a detour.

02:26.041 --> 02:27.750
- I would not wanna be
in your shoes and...

02:27.750 --> 02:29.083
and not just because
you're wearing

02:29.083 --> 02:31.333
cheap Patrick Cox knock-offs.

02:31.333 --> 02:33.083
- That's funny. Listen, I know
that the stakes are high,

02:33.083 --> 02:34.625
but I have got great big plans.

02:36.208 --> 02:37.958
Okay, start off by having
Katie read

02:37.958 --> 02:39.833
the first two chapters
of her book.

02:39.833 --> 02:42.291
- Hello! She only has
two chapters.

02:42.291 --> 02:44.208
- And I thought we could stage
a conversation between,

02:44.208 --> 02:45.916
you know, Katie and a friend,
over wine.

02:45.916 --> 02:47.291
Bring "The None" to life.

02:47.291 --> 02:48.833
- Two words: Kim Cattrall.

02:50.333 --> 02:51.750
- The actress?
- Yes!

02:51.750 --> 02:53.166
We hire her to play the friend.

02:53.166 --> 02:55.333
- Uh, you know that's one way
that we could do it for sure,

02:55.333 --> 02:57.541
but I was, um...

02:57.541 --> 02:58.833
I was thinking of something
just, you know,

02:58.833 --> 03:01.166
a little more real.

03:01.166 --> 03:04.083
- Real?
- Real, yes. Authentic.

03:04.083 --> 03:06.125
Getting an everyday woman,
bringing her onstage--

03:06.125 --> 03:08.125
- It's about selling
the dream, Erica.

03:08.125 --> 03:10.208
Selling the dream.

03:10.208 --> 03:12.375
- I know, but there's
a difference between the dream
and a fantasy.

03:12.375 --> 03:13.833
And that's the whole point
of the book.

03:13.833 --> 03:16.083
It's just to cut through
all that Hollywood,

03:16.083 --> 03:18.000
happily ever after,
Cinderella crap.

03:18.000 --> 03:20.375
- Interesting, but real people
can't act,

03:20.375 --> 03:22.833
real people can't stick
to a script.

03:22.833 --> 03:24.458
So if you want my help,
I think we should--

03:24.458 --> 03:26.333
Actually, Julianne put me
in charge of the title,

03:26.333 --> 03:28.833
so I'm launching it
the way I want to.

03:30.416 --> 03:33.458
- Hmm. Well then,
good luck with that.

03:33.458 --> 03:35.000
- B-b-brent.
- No-no-no-no-no.

03:35.000 --> 03:36.500
No, really,
you make a really mean latte,

03:36.500 --> 03:39.208
so I'm sure you're totally
qualified to launch a book.

03:39.208 --> 03:40.833
On your own.

03:42.875 --> 03:45.750
Erica: Control.
It's a dangerous obsession.

03:45.750 --> 03:47.250
Take it too far...

03:47.250 --> 03:49.625
and you could risk losing it
altogether.

04:35.250 --> 04:37.250
and tell us anything you
want to about love.

04:38.291 --> 04:40.541
- I mean, I have a lot
to offer a guy.

04:40.541 --> 04:43.291
- Mm-hmm.
- At least I think I do.

04:43.291 --> 04:45.916
Maybe I don't.

04:45.916 --> 04:47.541
Woman: The last guy I dated

04:47.541 --> 04:49.541
dumped me for some skinny chick
from his rock-climbing club.

04:51.125 --> 04:53.958
If there's a God, that dick
and his anorexic bitch

04:53.958 --> 04:56.375
will both plummet
to their deaths.

04:56.375 --> 04:58.416
- Give me a tight bod,
a heartbeat,

04:58.416 --> 05:00.291
and nipple clamps
and I'm a happy girl.

05:01.791 --> 05:03.375
Woman: Oh, well...

05:03.375 --> 05:05.500
When you're in your 20s
and you break up with a guy,

05:05.500 --> 05:06.916
you think, "Pfft! Whatever,

05:06.916 --> 05:08.458
no biggie, I'll just move on."

05:08.458 --> 05:11.041
And then you hit 30,

05:11.041 --> 05:12.875
and you're lucky if "the one"
is even a one night stand.

05:14.000 --> 05:16.625
- Yeah! (Laughs)
- (Laugh)

05:16.625 --> 05:19.875
I don't know,
if it's this hard at 33,

05:19.875 --> 05:22.375
what's gonna happen when I'm 40?

05:22.375 --> 05:24.375
This is what keeps me up
at night,

05:24.375 --> 05:26.000
in my bed,

05:26.000 --> 05:28.000
alone.

05:28.000 --> 05:29.708
- Oh, Andrea, thank you.

05:30.958 --> 05:32.333
Thank you. We'll be making
our decision shortly.

05:32.333 --> 05:34.458
- Well, it was good to meet you.
- You as well.

05:34.458 --> 05:36.333
- Absolutely.
- Bye.

05:39.625 --> 05:41.958
- Well, I think
we found our girl.

05:41.958 --> 05:43.375
- Me too! I loved that girl

05:43.375 --> 05:45.208
with the rock-climbing
boyfriend?

05:45.208 --> 05:47.458
She was righteous.
- Meeri, she was terrifying.

05:47.458 --> 05:49.083
I meant...
I mean, I meant Andrea.

05:49.083 --> 05:51.291
- Andrea? I guess.

05:51.291 --> 05:53.208
- Oh, you don't like her?
- She seemed kinda... pathetic.

05:54.916 --> 05:56.416
Pathetic? No, I think that
she was just being honest.

05:58.375 --> 06:00.791
- Yeah. Yeah, you're right.
Ah, I mean, what do I know?

06:00.791 --> 06:02.541
- Hey, listen, I'm interested
in your opinion, okay?

06:02.541 --> 06:04.083
I'm not one of those
crazy bosses like...

06:04.083 --> 06:05.708
- Like Julianne?

06:05.708 --> 06:08.500
Uh, all of the admin assistants
are terrified of her.

06:10.541 --> 06:12.791
- Listen, I have a really
big job for you, okay?

06:13.416 --> 06:15.791
I want you to be in charge
of finding the table

06:15.791 --> 06:17.250
and the chairs
for the girl launch.

06:17.250 --> 06:19.041
- Me? Really?

06:19.041 --> 06:21.208
- Yeah. Make the re-enactment
like a place that, you know,

06:21.208 --> 06:23.208
you and your girlfriends,
you'd like to hangout at.

06:23.208 --> 06:25.083
- I know. I won't disappoint.
- A lot riding on this.

06:26.916 --> 06:28.958
(Paper rustles)

06:28.958 --> 06:31.041
- (Under her breath)
Oh, she's fantastic.

06:31.041 --> 06:32.625
I mean, did you send
the right picture?

06:32.625 --> 06:34.708
Meeri, the re-enactment,
it needs to...

06:34.708 --> 06:36.750
you know, sell Katie
and the concept of the book.

06:38.333 --> 06:39.833
(Two heavy bangs against wall)

06:41.500 --> 06:43.125
- Uh-huh. Yeah, okay. Wood.
Yes, exactly. Perfect.

06:45.083 --> 06:47.041
Uh-huh. Thank you.

06:47.041 --> 06:49.250
Okay, see you tomorrow, Bye.

06:49.250 --> 06:51.000
(Phone beeps off, knock at door)

06:51.000 --> 06:52.500
Ethan: Erica, I know you're up,

06:52.500 --> 06:54.375
I-I can hear you through
my wall.

07:01.166 --> 07:03.166
- Hey.
- Hi.

07:03.166 --> 07:05.750
I guess you're um... here
to talk about this morning?

07:05.750 --> 07:07.708
- This morning,
the last two weeks.

07:07.708 --> 07:10.541
- Look, Ethan, I told you,
that I need time.

07:10.541 --> 07:12.750
- You also said
this would be temporary;

07:12.750 --> 07:14.541
that we'd go back
to being friends.

07:14.541 --> 07:16.000
- (Sighs) This is temporary.

07:16.000 --> 07:17.791
I'm just insanely busy
with work right now.

07:17.791 --> 07:19.458
- I see that.
Any way I can help?

07:19.458 --> 07:21.291
- No, it's late.
- I'll nap tomorrow
during recess.

07:23.583 --> 07:25.666
Sorry. Look, I know
you need time, I hear you.

07:25.666 --> 07:27.500
But for the record,

07:27.500 --> 07:29.666
I-I hate this.

07:29.666 --> 07:31.875
Anyway, don't stay up
too late, okay?

07:35.208 --> 07:38.333
Hey, look, um, it's my first
big book launch this Saturday,

07:38.333 --> 07:40.583
if you wanna come?

07:40.583 --> 07:41.458
(Laughs) You...

07:41.458 --> 07:43.458
I'm gonna be busy,
I'm gonna be running around

07:43.458 --> 07:46.166
like a chicken with its head cut
off, but Jude should be there

07:46.166 --> 07:48.125
and, you know, Katie, of course.

07:48.125 --> 07:51.250
- You know, it-it's Claire's
weekend to visit.

07:51.250 --> 07:54.125
- Oh. Uh, well, you know,
invite her too.

07:54.125 --> 07:55.458
- Really?
- Yeah.

07:55.458 --> 07:57.041
You're sure?

07:57.041 --> 07:58.291
Great. Well,
we'll see you there.
- Okay.

07:58.291 --> 08:00.458
- That's great.

08:02.583 --> 08:04.291
(Door creaks closed)

08:07.083 --> 08:09.291
Erica: Meeri,
everything looks perfect.

08:09.291 --> 08:12.208
Except for, you know, I did ask
for lilies not hydrangeas.

08:12.208 --> 08:14.041
- Ooh! Sturdy table,
comfy chairs...

08:15.583 --> 08:17.083
Pour me a glass of wine, Katie,

08:17.083 --> 08:18.666
and I'll be baring my heart
and soul to you.

08:18.666 --> 08:21.583
Both: (Laugh)
- One glass of wine
coming right up.

08:21.583 --> 08:23.291
So, we have everything
under control.

08:23.291 --> 08:25.333
And you're gonna love
the "real girl" we hired.

08:25.333 --> 08:27.041
She's amazing.

08:27.041 --> 08:29.083
- Yeah? Ooh, thanks. Mmm.

08:31.500 --> 08:34.125
Oh, wow! Memories of communion.

08:34.125 --> 08:35.625
(Clears throat)

08:37.916 --> 08:39.916
- Meeri, it's like I told you
the other day, all right.

08:39.916 --> 08:41.250
We're aiming for something
really special here,

08:41.250 --> 08:42.708
and there is nothing special

08:42.708 --> 08:44.500
about a cheap bottle
of screw-top wine.

08:44.500 --> 08:46.541
- It's fine.
The audience won't know.

08:46.541 --> 08:48.416
- Yeah, but Julianne will,
okay? So go.

08:48.416 --> 08:50.083
'Kay? Don't spend less than $30.

08:50.083 --> 08:52.375
Make sure to keep a receipt.

08:52.375 --> 08:54.416
- Well, look at you,
Ms. Task Master.

08:54.416 --> 08:56.125
- Only because Meeri is
turning me into one.

08:56.125 --> 08:57.500
It's like I have to hold
her hand

08:57.500 --> 08:59.000
for every tiny decision.

08:59.000 --> 09:00.416
(Baby cries)

09:00.416 --> 09:03.125
- (Gasps) There he is!

09:03.125 --> 09:05.250
(Excited squeal, Max cries)

09:06.791 --> 09:09.916
Judith, he is absolutely
adorable.

09:09.916 --> 09:12.708
- Yeah, he'd be a little more
adorable if he'd stop screaming
for five minutes.

09:12.708 --> 09:15.666
- Oh, can I hold him?
Maybe I can help.

09:15.666 --> 09:18.583
- Uh, wow! I thought that
Anthony was gonna watch
over Max?

09:18.583 --> 09:20.208
- He was, and then work called.

09:21.875 --> 09:24.291
- Wow, that's quite the set
of lungs you got on you.

09:24.291 --> 09:26.541
Audience: (Laughs)

09:26.541 --> 09:29.666
- No, Brian's shaving habits
are not perfect,

09:29.666 --> 09:31.541
but I'm not perfect either...

09:31.541 --> 09:33.375
- So true.
- And yet, he's the one for me

09:33.375 --> 09:35.333
and I'm the one for him.

09:35.333 --> 09:36.708
Audience: (Applauds)

09:36.708 --> 09:38.000
Judith: Be nice.

09:38.000 --> 09:40.541
- Hey, sorry we're late.
We had to park all the way over
on Harbord Street.

09:40.541 --> 09:42.291
- Oh, no, that's fine.
Katie just started.

09:42.291 --> 09:44.583
- Such a big dream of yours
finally coming true.

09:44.583 --> 09:46.833
Katie: The problem with my
single friend...
- Congratulations.

09:46.833 --> 09:49.041
- Thank you.
Katie: ...is not that
she's unrealistic, no.

09:50.583 --> 09:52.375
She's been led astray.

09:52.375 --> 09:54.666
She's trying so hard
to find "the one"

09:54.666 --> 09:57.000
that all that she's left
with is "The None."

09:58.791 --> 10:01.250
And that is the end
of the first chapter

10:01.250 --> 10:03.583
from my new and first book.

10:03.583 --> 10:06.041
Audience: (Applauds)

10:06.041 --> 10:08.041
- Woo-hoo!

10:08.041 --> 10:10.500
- Looks like you have
a palpable hit on your hands.

10:10.500 --> 10:13.750
(Applauding)

10:13.750 --> 10:16.666
- Now I would like
to introduce to you...

10:16.666 --> 10:19.333
- Oh, she's great,
you're gonna love her.

10:19.333 --> 10:21.333
- ...single friend of mine,
Andrea Traub.

10:21.333 --> 10:23.125
- Hi! (Giggles)
- (Audience applauds)

10:24.833 --> 10:26.791
Katie: Andrea and I are gonna
have a little session here,

10:26.791 --> 10:28.250
a little girl talk.

10:28.250 --> 10:29.708
- Well, here's the thing...

10:29.708 --> 10:32.583
Oh, by the way, Katie,
I love your column.

10:32.583 --> 10:33.916
- Oh...
- Love it!

10:33.916 --> 10:35.416
Vino! May I?

10:35.416 --> 10:37.333
Okay, here's the thing.
I'm young, I'm hot,

10:39.583 --> 10:40.958
and I make a six figure income.

10:40.958 --> 10:42.541
- And yet you sleep alone.

10:42.541 --> 10:45.000
Which is the plight
of so many women.

10:45.000 --> 10:46.791
- Sharing my bed,
technically not the problem.

10:48.583 --> 10:50.375
Ah hell, I share my bed two,
three nights a week.

10:52.041 --> 10:53.708
It's just, it's...
it's never with the same guy.

10:55.958 --> 10:58.791
Oh, unless, do twins count?
(Audience titters)

10:58.791 --> 11:01.208
- Uh... twins?
- Yeah, two for
the price of one.

11:03.541 --> 11:06.750
Oh my God, I met the most
gorgeous set of Armenian twins

11:06.750 --> 11:08.916
at The Drake last weekend.
(Max cries)

11:08.916 --> 11:10.791
Friday night, it was Armen.
Saturday night, it was Arsen.

11:12.250 --> 11:13.750
- Quiet, hey? Max.

11:13.750 --> 11:16.375
Max, honey, now is not the time,
okay?

11:16.375 --> 11:17.791
Andrea: ...and then Armen.

11:17.791 --> 11:19.541
- Wow! Who chose the horn dog?

11:19.541 --> 11:21.583
Andrea: And Sunday was supposed
to be a threesome,

11:21.583 --> 11:23.416
but I think that woulda
been weird, right?

11:24.875 --> 11:26.708
- Maybe you should get her
off the stage, you know?

11:26.708 --> 11:28.750
I've put on my share of events
for Tourism Quebec.

11:28.750 --> 11:30.708
- Okay, thank you, Claire.
You know what?

11:30.708 --> 11:32.500
I'm just gonna waltz up
on stage and do that

11:32.500 --> 11:33.875
'cause no one will notice
a thing.

11:33.875 --> 11:35.166
It's a great idea. It's great.

11:35.166 --> 11:36.750
(Max cries)

11:39.416 --> 11:41.250
- I'm gonna go get a coffee.
I'll wait for you outside.

11:41.583 --> 11:43.041
- Claire.

11:43.041 --> 11:44.375
(Max fusses and cries)

11:47.333 --> 11:49.375
- Good one.

11:49.375 --> 11:51.833
(Max cries)

11:51.833 --> 11:53.291
- Listen, I'll be right back,
okay?

11:53.291 --> 11:55.166
Shh-shh-shh.
(Max cries)

11:56.625 --> 11:58.250
(Door opens)

12:01.041 --> 12:02.708
- Hey, Ethan! Ethan!
- She was just trying to help!

12:02.708 --> 12:05.333
- I know.
- So why couldn't you
just be nice to her?

12:05.333 --> 12:06.708
I mean, you say you
wanna be friends.

12:06.708 --> 12:08.625
- And I, you know,
I do wanna be friends.

12:08.625 --> 12:10.791
But I also told you
that I need time.

12:10.791 --> 12:13.333
- Then why did you
invite me here today?

12:13.333 --> 12:15.791
- Because you were
guilting me out.

12:15.791 --> 12:17.916
- Guilting you out? I just want
everything to be like it was.

12:17.916 --> 12:19.416
- That is the point, Ethan,
it can't be, okay?

12:19.416 --> 12:21.750
It can't. And you-you just...

12:21.750 --> 12:23.666
- I what, Erica?
- You just, you know,
you coast along

12:23.666 --> 12:26.541
and you refuse to deal
with anything.

12:26.541 --> 12:27.750
- What I can't deal with
is this.

12:27.750 --> 12:30.708
- No, you know what? Hey!
You wanted to talk?
This is me talking.

12:30.708 --> 12:32.541
This is me saying
what I've wanted to say to you

12:32.541 --> 12:34.000
since you gave Claire
a second chance.

12:34.000 --> 12:35.541
Because I don't get it.

12:35.541 --> 12:37.750
I mean, she cheated on you
and then she dumped you,

12:37.750 --> 12:39.250
and the second she expresses

12:39.250 --> 12:40.875
the tiniest little bit of doubt,

12:40.875 --> 12:42.583
there you are, and you're
right back at her feet.

12:42.583 --> 12:44.041
- We were married for ten years.

12:44.041 --> 12:45.500
- Oh, don't give me that!
You know,

12:45.500 --> 12:47.333
if you were still
so in love with her,

12:47.333 --> 12:49.458
then why did we kiss? Huh?

12:49.458 --> 12:51.583
Why are you still in Toronto
when you should be in Montreal

12:51.583 --> 12:53.625
working on your marriage?

12:55.166 --> 12:56.625
You're just...
you are terrified,

12:56.625 --> 12:58.458
you are terrified
of making a decision,

12:58.458 --> 13:01.041
of committing to anything,

13:01.041 --> 13:03.791
and that is why you and I are
at the impasse that we're at.

13:03.791 --> 13:07.208
And I am tired of it! I am
tired of you holding our past
for emotional ransom.

13:09.625 --> 13:11.375
(Exhaling heavily)

13:18.666 --> 13:20.750
(Whoosh, Erica groans)

13:25.458 --> 13:27.416
- Dr. Tom?
- Over here.

13:30.833 --> 13:32.541
- (Groans)

13:32.541 --> 13:34.583
- The lotus position.

13:34.583 --> 13:36.291
Also known as padmasana.

13:39.833 --> 13:42.583
Yoga prepares the body
for meditation,

13:42.583 --> 13:44.958
which allows us
to observe our thoughts

13:46.541 --> 13:48.625
so that we're not
controlled by them.

13:48.625 --> 13:51.041
Also lights a fire
under your kundalini.

13:51.041 --> 13:53.916
- Pardon me?
- Please, sit.

13:53.916 --> 13:55.791
- (Irritated sigh)

14:01.458 --> 14:04.708
- See, the goal here is
to harmonize the mind
with the body;

14:04.708 --> 14:06.583
to keep the focus... here.

14:08.500 --> 14:10.875
You know, as opposed to
everything going on up here.

14:10.875 --> 14:13.583
You should give it a go
sometime. It might do you
some good.

14:13.583 --> 14:15.083
(Smacks lips) So.

14:15.083 --> 14:17.000
- Well, everything
is a disaster.

14:17.000 --> 14:18.875
I mean, the launch is...
and Ethan.

14:20.458 --> 14:22.208
I mean, my God,
after what I just said,

14:22.208 --> 14:23.791
I don't think that
he's ever gonna forgive me.

14:23.791 --> 14:25.458
But you know what?
Everything that I said,

14:25.458 --> 14:26.916
it was the truth.

14:26.916 --> 14:28.291
He just...
he didn't wanna hear it.

14:28.291 --> 14:29.666
He didn't wanna believe it.

14:29.666 --> 14:31.458
- So what did he say in return?

14:31.458 --> 14:33.583
- Wha-? Ethan speak? Please.

14:33.583 --> 14:36.541
He's become this
emotionally paralyzed thing.

14:36.541 --> 14:38.625
I mean, a few weeks ago,
I told him that I loved him

14:38.625 --> 14:40.500
and now, I would...

14:40.500 --> 14:41.833
I would rather hang out
with Claire.

14:41.833 --> 14:43.666
- Well, you know,

14:43.666 --> 14:45.791
all friendships do go through
their rough patches.

14:45.791 --> 14:47.208
- Mm-mm.
No, this is more than that.

14:47.208 --> 14:50.083
It just, it feels like
the foundations

14:50.083 --> 14:53.041
have been ripped out
of our friendship.

14:53.041 --> 14:55.583
I should have never
kissed Ethan.

14:55.583 --> 14:57.958
- Hmm.

14:57.958 --> 14:59.458
Now... (Items rustle)

15:01.666 --> 15:03.250
Well, then go ahead then.

15:03.250 --> 15:05.666
- And do what?
- Well, add it to the list then.

15:05.666 --> 15:08.125
Kissing Ethan.

15:08.125 --> 15:10.583
I can do that?
I mean... I can just things?

15:10.583 --> 15:13.166
- "He who controls the present,
controls the past.

15:13.166 --> 15:15.458
He who controls the past,
controls the future."

15:15.458 --> 15:17.458
George Orwell.

15:17.458 --> 15:19.458
- Okay.
(Cleansing breath)

15:21.041 --> 15:22.791
Kissing...

15:24.333 --> 15:25.750
Ethan. (Pad thumps on floor)

15:25.750 --> 15:27.166
- Done.
- So, tell me.

15:27.166 --> 15:29.208
- Okay, um...
It was a few months ago.

15:29.208 --> 15:31.041
As you know,
it was my high school reunion

15:32.916 --> 15:35.083
and I brought Ethan as my date.

15:35.083 --> 15:37.208
More like fake boyfriend.

15:37.208 --> 15:39.000
Uh, but that night he did
everything a boyfriend should.

15:40.791 --> 15:43.000
He was just
so incredibly caring.

15:43.000 --> 15:44.958
Loving, actually.

15:44.958 --> 15:48.000
And I don't know if it was
that I was vulnerable,

15:48.000 --> 15:49.916
or maybe he was too, but...

15:49.916 --> 15:51.958
I kissed him.

15:51.958 --> 15:53.916
And, at the time, it felt like
the most natural thing

15:53.916 --> 15:56.541
in the world.

15:56.541 --> 15:58.500
I kissed him and nothing
has been the same since.

16:00.041 --> 16:01.416
It destroyed our friendship.

16:03.000 --> 16:04.625
If I could go back,
I would not kiss Ethan.

16:06.208 --> 16:08.833
I wouldn't,
I wouldn't put us in jeopardy.

16:08.833 --> 16:10.791
- Oh. You know,
avoiding that kiss

16:10.791 --> 16:13.750
is not gonna undo any feelings
that you have now,

16:13.750 --> 16:15.250
your love for him.

16:15.250 --> 16:16.750
- But that's my problem,
it's not his.

16:18.416 --> 16:20.958
- Namaste.

16:20.958 --> 16:22.833
(Sharp gasp, hard thud)

16:22.833 --> 16:24.583
- Oh my God, Erica.
Are you okay?

16:24.583 --> 16:26.708
- Yeah. No, I'm fine.
I'm fine. (Laughs)

16:28.291 --> 16:29.708
Wowzer!
It's getting really late,

16:29.708 --> 16:32.250
so I'm gonna go. Um, uh...

16:32.250 --> 16:35.083
Don't forget your ice cream,
it's gonna melt. (Mumbles)

16:35.083 --> 16:37.541
Uh, thanks, Ethan.

16:37.541 --> 16:38.958
Okay, good night.

16:38.958 --> 16:40.250
- Bye.
- Bye.

16:46.833 --> 16:48.125
(Sharp inhale) Okay.

16:49.791 --> 16:51.541
(Siren wails in the distance,
birds chirp)

16:53.041 --> 16:54.666
(Groggy moan)

16:54.666 --> 16:57.625
(Exhales)

17:03.166 --> 17:04.458
(Exhales, dialing beeps)

17:07.916 --> 17:10.041
(Telephone ringing)

17:13.041 --> 17:15.166
- Hello?
- Hey, Jude, it's me.

17:16.583 --> 17:18.166
- Erica.

17:18.166 --> 17:19.958
Why are you calling me so early?

17:19.958 --> 17:21.208
- Well, I thought that
you'd be up.

17:21.208 --> 17:23.041
- Up?

17:23.041 --> 17:24.375
I didn't leave
the reunion 'til...

17:24.375 --> 17:27.166
It must've been, God, 2:30.

17:27.166 --> 17:28.458
- The reunion. The...

17:30.000 --> 17:31.750
Right, last night.
- Yes.

17:31.750 --> 17:33.666
Are you okay?

17:33.666 --> 17:35.250
- Yeah, no, I'm fine. Sorry.

17:35.250 --> 17:37.708
Uh, hey listen,
go back to sleep.

17:37.708 --> 17:39.750
(Groggy groan)
No, I gotta get brunch going.

17:41.708 --> 17:43.666
- But the brunch, I remember
that I canceled the brunch.

17:43.666 --> 17:45.166
- Erica, what's going on?

17:45.166 --> 17:47.166
About 20 of your closest
friends and classmates

17:47.166 --> 17:48.833
are about to descend
on your place.

17:48.833 --> 17:50.625
- (Exhales) I know, I'm just--

17:50.625 --> 17:52.125
Sorry, I'm still half asleep.

17:52.125 --> 17:54.208
But, uh, brunch is...
it's gonna be great.

17:54.208 --> 17:56.208
Um-um, I'm gonna,
I'll see you soon, okay?

17:58.583 --> 17:59.875
(Phone beeps off) Oh God.

18:01.083 --> 18:02.916
- Oh, hey, whoa!
Hey, let me help.

18:02.916 --> 18:04.625
Oh, I got it.
Oh, I think I got it.

18:04.625 --> 18:06.916
- That's okay.
- Okay, thanks.

18:06.916 --> 18:08.791
- Um...

18:10.250 --> 18:11.750
- So, um...

18:11.750 --> 18:13.208
you left in a real hurry
last night.

18:13.208 --> 18:14.791
Oh, no. You know what?
I was just...

18:14.791 --> 18:17.083
I was just really tired and...

18:17.083 --> 18:18.958
I had to get up early
for this brunch thing, so.

18:20.541 --> 18:22.125
- Brunch? Jenny and Judith
coming?

18:22.125 --> 18:24.458
Jenny and Judith and a bunch
of people you don't know.

18:24.458 --> 18:25.708
So it's kind of like
last night.

18:25.708 --> 18:27.583
- Oh. I had fun last night.

18:29.791 --> 18:31.291
- Good, I'm glad that you did.

18:31.291 --> 18:33.291
And thank you again.

18:33.291 --> 18:34.125
Ah... wow,

18:34.125 --> 18:36.125
the bacon and the French toast
aren't gonna cook themselves.

18:36.125 --> 18:38.125
I should get started on it.
- Oh, okay.

18:38.125 --> 18:40.125
- I'll see you later, okay?
- Okay, okay. Yeah.

18:40.125 --> 18:42.833
Thank you. Bye!

18:42.833 --> 18:45.125
(Door shuts)

18:45.125 --> 18:47.291
- What is it with "French" in
front of all the foods we eat?

18:47.291 --> 18:49.625
French fries, French toast...

18:49.625 --> 18:51.041
French onion soup. See?

18:51.041 --> 18:52.458
- Right.
- Right, right.

18:52.458 --> 18:53.916
Anyway, back to Ethan.

18:53.916 --> 18:55.375
- Oh, come on,
there's nothing to tell.

18:55.375 --> 18:57.333
I mean, there was like...
like a momentary

18:57.333 --> 18:59.208
little spark between us,
but it was nothing.

18:59.208 --> 19:00.875
- Look at you,
sparking with Ethan,

19:00.875 --> 19:02.333
sparking with Alex Berlin.

19:02.333 --> 19:03.791
You, my dear, put me to shame.

19:03.791 --> 19:06.166
- Yeah, that is a hard choice
between the guy that you
lost it with

19:06.166 --> 19:07.750
and the guy that
you've known forever.

19:07.750 --> 19:09.125
- Oh, come on,
one night of sex--

19:09.125 --> 19:10.708
- In a canoe. Hello!

19:10.708 --> 19:12.875
- Versus 15 years of history.

19:12.875 --> 19:14.291
I mean that's hardly
a fair fight.

19:14.291 --> 19:17.125
- Exactly. You know Ethan,
you love him...

19:17.125 --> 19:20.000
I mean, like a friend.
- Right.

19:20.000 --> 19:22.458
- Yeah, exactly, he's a friend.
He's a really good friend

19:22.458 --> 19:24.791
and that's-that's a friendship
that I don't wanna mess up.

19:24.791 --> 19:27.166
- Okay, but, I don't know,
you two guys just...

19:27.166 --> 19:29.000
have just always seemed
perfect for each other.
- Mm-hmm.

19:29.000 --> 19:31.083
- Well, you know, it's too much
to the risk, Jude, believe me.

19:31.083 --> 19:32.916
- Erica, the best way
to get over a guy

19:32.916 --> 19:35.000
is to get under one.
It's a fact.

19:35.000 --> 19:37.125
And by under,
I mean Alex Berlin.

19:37.125 --> 19:40.375
- Oh, okay, Alex Berlin,
he thinks I'm a pathological
lying freak.

19:40.375 --> 19:42.166
And he likes trains.
- So what?

19:42.166 --> 19:44.625
Oh my God, if I'd known back in
grade eleven what I know now?

19:44.625 --> 19:46.958
It woulda been me popping
Alex's cherry, not you.

19:46.958 --> 19:48.500
- Unreal.

19:48.500 --> 19:50.416
Now I do think that
is a great idea though.

19:50.416 --> 19:52.083
His number's in
the Alumni Directory.

19:52.083 --> 19:54.458
- Yes. It's either Alex
or Ethan.

19:54.458 --> 19:56.500
You're way too pretty
to die an old maid.

19:56.500 --> 19:58.041
Now I know it's a long shot,

19:58.041 --> 20:00.000
but I'm just gonna call Alex
and invite him to brunch

20:00.000 --> 20:01.416
and I'll forget to tell him
that it's here,

20:01.416 --> 20:03.333
hosted by you, the freak.

20:03.333 --> 20:05.166
(Dialing beeps)
- Yeah.

20:05.166 --> 20:07.416
- Unreal.
- (Laughs)

20:07.416 --> 20:10.208
- There you go. Enjoy.

20:10.208 --> 20:11.916
(Nervous laugh)

20:11.916 --> 20:13.416
There he is, you guys.
What do I do?

20:13.416 --> 20:15.375
Jenny: Go and say hello,
like a normal human.

20:15.375 --> 20:17.000
- (Mimics Jenny
with high-pitch mumble)

20:17.000 --> 20:19.041
(Whispers) I can't believe
you called him.

20:21.125 --> 20:24.083
(Clears throat) Hi, Alex.

20:24.083 --> 20:26.250
- You're here.
- Yeah, I am.
This is, um, my apartment.

20:27.791 --> 20:29.583
- Oh.
- Alex, please,

20:29.583 --> 20:32.250
look, I know that last night,
it was really unfair.

20:32.250 --> 20:34.958
- Uh, yeah, last night
was... bizarre.

20:36.500 --> 20:37.958
- Yeah. Gee, I wonder why?

20:37.958 --> 20:39.333
Maybe because I made up
a fake boyfriend

20:39.333 --> 20:42.000
and then lied to you?
- Yup.

20:42.000 --> 20:43.541
- Look, the reason
why I did that

20:43.541 --> 20:46.208
is because I knew that
Katie Atkins was gonna be there

20:46.208 --> 20:48.125
and I was insecure,

20:48.125 --> 20:50.166
and I didn't want her to think
that I was this big loser

20:50.166 --> 20:52.958
and then you just got caught up
in the middle of it.

20:52.958 --> 20:54.291
I'm sorry.

20:55.916 --> 20:57.291
Peace?

20:59.333 --> 21:01.250
I promise that it's not spiked
with anything stronger
than champagne.

21:01.250 --> 21:02.791
(Chuckles)

21:04.708 --> 21:06.250
- Mm, it's good.

21:06.250 --> 21:07.750
- Good, great.
Hey, listen, come on in.

21:07.750 --> 21:10.291
Make yourself comfortable,
we've got lots of food.

21:10.291 --> 21:12.375
- Do you got eggs? I love eggs.

21:12.375 --> 21:14.708
Do we have eggs?
We got scrambled and over-easy

21:16.250 --> 21:19.208
and devilled and poached
and... eggs.

21:19.208 --> 21:21.041
(Muffled music
from Erica's plays)

21:27.041 --> 21:29.125
(Slams books on shelf)

21:29.125 --> 21:31.458
Alex: So I played the French
horn in band class, right,
- Mm-hmm.

21:31.458 --> 21:34.125
and Katie used to pour milk
into it.

21:34.125 --> 21:36.291
And then the milk,
of course, would sour.

21:36.291 --> 21:38.541
- And then she would tell
everyone that the bad smell
was you.

21:38.541 --> 21:41.208
- You mean, people thought
I smelled like bad milk?

21:41.208 --> 21:43.250
- Kinda.
- (Awkward laugh)

21:46.291 --> 21:48.375
- Ethan, hey.
Um... are you here for brunch?

21:48.375 --> 21:49.750
Because we've got more
than enough food.

21:49.750 --> 21:52.333
- Actually, I'm here to talk
to Erica.
- Erica. Wow, yeah.

21:52.333 --> 21:53.750
Uh, you know,
she made a great spread.

21:53.750 --> 21:55.958
Why don't I make you a plate.
- Great spread. So good.
Try some.

21:55.958 --> 21:57.333
- Okay, what the hell
is going on?

21:57.333 --> 21:59.541
You guys are acting
just as weird as she is.

21:59.541 --> 22:01.625
Have I done something?

22:01.625 --> 22:04.583
Um... Erica's actually just
right over there talking
to Alex Berlin.

22:04.583 --> 22:07.666
Erica: No, honestly, Ethan
and I are- we're just friends.

22:07.666 --> 22:09.833
I mean, he was in
on the whole thing.

22:09.833 --> 22:11.250
- Hmm.
- Mm-hmm.

22:11.250 --> 22:12.750
- Ethan!
- Erica.

22:12.750 --> 22:14.458
- Hey, wh-when did you
get here?

22:14.458 --> 22:17.291
- Just now.
- Oh. I don't know that you
guys officially met last night.

22:17.291 --> 22:18.875
Alex this is Ethan.
Ethan this is Alex.

22:20.458 --> 22:21.958
It's so funny,
'cause I was just...

22:21.958 --> 22:25.458
I was just telling Alex
what amazing friends we are.

22:25.458 --> 22:27.000
- Nice to meet you.
- You too.

22:27.000 --> 22:29.416
- Yeah, I mean, Ethan and I,
we met in university,

22:29.416 --> 22:31.208
in drama class of all things,
right?

22:31.208 --> 22:34.250
And we've just, we've been
best budderoos ever since.

22:34.250 --> 22:36.208
The only difference between
Ethan and my girlfriends

22:36.208 --> 22:37.625
is that he knows how
to kill a spider

22:37.625 --> 22:39.500
and hook up my PVR, right?

22:42.125 --> 22:44.208
- Nice to meet you, Alex.
- You too, Ethan.

22:47.541 --> 22:49.500
- Alex, can you just excuse me
for one second?

22:49.500 --> 22:51.083
- Yeah, of course.
- Be right back.

22:53.000 --> 22:54.458
Ethan! Hey, where are you going?

22:54.458 --> 22:56.666
- Home.
- But is everything okay?

22:56.666 --> 22:58.583
- I don't know, Erica?
You tell me. What have I done?

22:58.583 --> 23:00.041
- Well, y-y-you haven't
done anything.

23:00.041 --> 23:02.500
Then why are you treating me
like this?

23:02.500 --> 23:04.291
You ignore me one minute, then
we're all buddies the next.

23:04.291 --> 23:05.958
- Hey, hey, hey. Look,
I'm not mad at you

23:05.958 --> 23:08.125
or anything at all. Uh...

23:08.125 --> 23:09.583
- Then why are you acting
so weird?

23:09.583 --> 23:12.916
Last night, I was there,
and I felt something

23:12.916 --> 23:15.000
and I know you did too.

23:15.000 --> 23:16.250
And you're freaked out.
Hell, I'm freaked out.

23:16.250 --> 23:18.625
- You know what, Ethan, I should
probably-I really should--

23:18.625 --> 23:20.000
- Erica.

23:20.000 --> 23:23.208
You felt something, didn't you?

23:23.208 --> 23:26.041
- (Sighs) Ethan, even if I did,
we're...

23:27.541 --> 23:29.166
I mean, we're friends.

23:29.166 --> 23:31.083
- What does that matter?

23:34.916 --> 23:36.875
(Kissing)

23:40.416 --> 23:42.500
- Isn't that a good thing?
- Yes.

23:46.083 --> 23:48.416
- (Gasps) Alex? Alex!

23:48.416 --> 23:49.833
Oh God... Oh shit.

23:51.916 --> 23:54.125
Oh shit! (Whoosh)

23:54.125 --> 23:56.333
Oh.

23:56.333 --> 23:58.458
I kissed him again.

23:58.458 --> 24:00.583
- Who? Alex Berlin?
- No. Ethan.

24:02.208 --> 24:04.416
I'm going from upward dog
right into downward dog

24:04.416 --> 24:06.958
and you're kind of
in the way there.

24:06.958 --> 24:09.083
- Hey, did you...
- Thanks.
- Did you hear what I said?

24:09.083 --> 24:11.083
- Yeah, yeah. You kissed Ethan.
It's not like it's
the first time.

24:11.083 --> 24:13.416
- Yeah, but it is
the first time, again,

24:13.416 --> 24:15.166
and I wasn't supposed to,
but I did.

24:15.166 --> 24:17.416
And why did I do that? I mean,
what is it? Unavoidable? What?

24:20.250 --> 24:22.708
What if I was meant to go back
and not keep us apart,

24:22.708 --> 24:24.375
but get us together?

24:24.375 --> 24:26.458
What if I was wrong all along?

24:26.458 --> 24:29.583
- "We create our fate,
every day we live."

24:29.583 --> 24:31.125
Henry Miller.

24:31.125 --> 24:33.625
I wanna add another regret
to my list.

24:33.625 --> 24:35.541
- (Sighs) Erica.
- It was my first term
of my undergrad,

24:35.541 --> 24:37.125
and Ethan and I, we were...

24:37.125 --> 24:38.958
we were in drama class together.

24:40.625 --> 24:42.250
And because we knew each other
from residence,

24:42.250 --> 24:44.291
he asked me to be
his scene partner.

24:44.291 --> 24:46.958
Our first assignment,
it was the balcony scene
from "Romeo and Juliet."

24:48.541 --> 24:50.250
I mean, we were terrible
actors, but...

24:50.250 --> 24:52.708
(Sighs) The scene,
it was incredibly romantic.

24:52.708 --> 24:55.250
You know, reading poetry
to each other

24:55.250 --> 24:56.708
and pretending to be lovers.

24:56.708 --> 24:58.583
It was really hot.

24:58.583 --> 25:00.166
But I-I wasn't looking
for a boyfriend

25:00.166 --> 25:01.791
because I'd just broken up
with my ex,

25:01.791 --> 25:04.458
so romance, it was
the last thing on my mind.

25:04.458 --> 25:06.208
So I missed the obvious.

25:06.208 --> 25:08.125
Ethan liked me, he pursued me,

25:08.125 --> 25:09.458
and I did everything
in my power

25:09.458 --> 25:11.416
to keep us just friends.

25:11.416 --> 25:13.916
But Claire, she had no doubts,
you know?

25:13.916 --> 25:15.916
She just... she stepped right
into the vacuum, and then...

25:15.916 --> 25:17.541
and then, before I knew it,
they were a couple.

25:19.375 --> 25:21.375
And the rest is history.

25:21.375 --> 25:23.958
- And so, you wanna do what,
exactly?

25:25.583 --> 25:27.583
- I wanna go back and become
Ethan's girlfriend,

25:29.041 --> 25:30.625
not his friend.

25:30.625 --> 25:32.583
I wanna make up for all those
wasted years

25:32.583 --> 25:34.166
that we could've been together.

25:34.166 --> 25:37.541
- Yeah, but you were together,
as friends.

25:37.541 --> 25:39.041
So you're sure that
you wanna go back

25:39.041 --> 25:41.583
and rewrite that?

25:41.583 --> 25:42.916
- Yes. Yes.

25:45.333 --> 25:47.291
- Yeah. All right, well,
hey, it's your list.

25:52.166 --> 25:54.458
- Just... friends...

25:56.708 --> 25:58.500
with Ethan.

26:01.125 --> 26:02.666
(Satisfied sigh, whoosh)

26:02.666 --> 26:05.250
Ethan: My life were better
ended by their hate

26:05.250 --> 26:08.291
than death prorogued
wanting of thy love.

26:09.916 --> 26:12.041
Than death prorogued
wanting of thy love.

26:13.541 --> 26:15.416
- (Exhales heavily)

26:15.416 --> 26:18.208
(Stammers and exhales)
Where are we in...?

26:20.416 --> 26:23.291
- By whose direction
foundest thou out this place?

26:23.291 --> 26:25.166
- Right, I'm-I'm sorry,
I just uh...

26:25.166 --> 26:26.666
lost my train of thought.

26:26.666 --> 26:28.666
- Which means you are not
invested in the scene,

26:28.666 --> 26:30.333
or in Shakespeare's words.

26:30.333 --> 26:32.125
- I'm sorry, Professor Thorsson.

26:32.125 --> 26:34.125
- (Sighs) That is all for today.

26:35.750 --> 26:37.708
Your homework?
Practice, practice, practice.

26:40.458 --> 26:42.625
Ethan: I-I don't get it. You
were off book way before I was.

26:42.625 --> 26:44.875
I know. I'm so sorry, Ethan.

26:44.875 --> 26:47.458
You know, I-I'm gonna be fine,
it was just nerves.

26:47.458 --> 26:49.333
- Right.
- Hey, guys, good work.

26:50.875 --> 26:52.833
I'm jealous. I play Lady Macbeth

26:52.833 --> 26:55.625
and she's not a very nice woman.
At all.

26:55.625 --> 26:57.750
- Don't worry, Thorsson
was casting against type.

26:57.750 --> 26:59.750
- Could I have a word, my dear?

26:59.750 --> 27:02.041
- Uh, sure.

27:02.041 --> 27:05.125
- I'm a firm believer
in the Stanislavski's system.

27:05.125 --> 27:06.666
Have you heard of it?

27:06.666 --> 27:09.583
- Uh... no.
- It's a wonderful tool.

27:09.583 --> 27:12.166
You take the text
and you make it your own.

27:12.166 --> 27:14.208
You play out your emotions -

27:14.208 --> 27:16.833
how you would feel as Erica,
not Juliet.

27:16.833 --> 27:19.333
- Okay, so Stanislavski?
- Mm-hmm.

27:19.333 --> 27:21.333
- That's great, you know what?
I'm gonna Google him.

27:21.333 --> 27:23.416
Thank you.
- Google?

27:23.416 --> 27:24.833
- Hey!
- Hey. Claire invited us

27:24.833 --> 27:26.833
to grab a cup of coffee
at Jet Fuel.

27:26.833 --> 27:28.916
It's in the east end,
but it's the best in the city.

27:28.916 --> 27:30.375
- Oh, you know, I would love to,

27:30.375 --> 27:32.333
but I have to memorize
my lines, so...

27:32.333 --> 27:34.500
- Oh. Well, why don't you do
that and Ethan can come with me.

27:34.500 --> 27:36.833
- You know, it really helps me
to rehearse with a partner,

27:36.833 --> 27:38.541
- Oh, well...
- if, you know, you don't mind.

27:38.541 --> 27:40.375
- Well--
- But, hey, good luck.

27:41.958 --> 27:43.291
Break a leg tomorrow.
- Yeah. Oh.

27:43.291 --> 27:45.083
- All right, Ethan.

27:45.083 --> 27:46.875
Ethan: Well, you had the first
part of the scene down,

27:46.875 --> 27:49.458
so let's focus on the um...
let's see here...

27:49.458 --> 27:50.916
You know, I'm just wondering,

27:50.916 --> 27:52.791
Why are you taking
a theatre class?

27:52.791 --> 27:54.666
I mean, you don't wanna be
an actor.

27:54.666 --> 27:56.375
- Two answers.
One I can tell you,

27:56.375 --> 27:58.666
the other, I'll only admit
if you promise not to laugh.

27:58.666 --> 28:00.166
- Okay, I promise.

28:00.166 --> 28:01.791
- Okay, it's good to have it
on my transcript

28:01.791 --> 28:04.041
if I apply to Teachers'
College, and if um...

28:04.041 --> 28:06.458
Well, if I wanna become
the first legitimate
white rapper instead,

28:06.458 --> 28:08.708
I thought it could help
with my stage presence.

28:08.708 --> 28:11.041
- (Laughs)
- Okay, I am the biggest dork
ever.

28:11.041 --> 28:13.041
- No, no, I think
it's really sweet,

28:13.041 --> 28:15.666
but you would make
a great teacher.

28:15.666 --> 28:17.333
- (Half laughs) A teacher
is nowhere near as sexy

28:17.333 --> 28:19.541
as international
Hip-Hop superstar.

28:19.541 --> 28:21.041
Oh, yes it is.

28:21.041 --> 28:23.416
I mean, your kids,
they're gonna adore you.

28:23.416 --> 28:26.291
They're gonna see
how sweet and good

28:26.291 --> 28:28.416
and caring you are.

28:28.416 --> 28:29.916
Take it from me,
those qualities,

28:29.916 --> 28:32.375
they're... they're very,
very sexy in a man.

28:34.875 --> 28:36.958
- Oh, uh... thanks.

28:36.958 --> 28:39.416
Um, okay, let's just take it
from your line right here.

28:39.416 --> 28:41.500
Um, "What satisfaction
canst thou have tonight?"

28:41.500 --> 28:43.625
- Sure. How about over here?

28:43.625 --> 28:45.375
- Yeah, yeah, great.

28:51.333 --> 28:53.500
- What satisfaction
canst thou have tonight?

28:53.500 --> 28:56.000
- The exchange of thy love's
faithful vow for mine.

28:56.000 --> 28:58.500
- But I gave thee mine
before thou did request it

28:58.500 --> 29:01.583
and yet I would...
it were to give again.

29:01.583 --> 29:04.541
- Um, wouldst thou withdraw it?
For what purpose, love?

29:04.541 --> 29:06.958
- But to be frank
and give it thee again.

29:06.958 --> 29:08.500
(Kissing)

29:08.500 --> 29:10.416
- Um...

29:10.416 --> 29:11.791
- What?

29:14.375 --> 29:16.875
- Uh, um... We-we weren't
gonna do a kiss.

29:18.416 --> 29:20.458
- Oh, you know, I know, but...

29:20.458 --> 29:23.708
it's only the most romantic
scene ever written, so...

29:23.708 --> 29:26.125
Don't you think we should?
- Well, it doesn't say here
anything about that,

29:26.125 --> 29:28.833
so we probably shouldn't
deliver one, okay?

29:31.166 --> 29:32.875
- Okay.
- Uh, let's take it
from the top.

29:32.875 --> 29:36.041
- Sure. Definitely.

29:36.041 --> 29:39.041
- But soft, what light
through yonder window breaks,

29:39.041 --> 29:41.458
it is the east
and Juliet is the sun...

29:48.625 --> 29:51.125
Dr. Tom: So how goes it?

29:51.125 --> 29:52.916
Is your regret everything
you hoped for and more?

29:55.041 --> 29:58.041
- No, I think... I think that
I'm actually scaring off Ethan.

29:58.041 --> 29:59.791
- Oh, really?
- Yeah, I mean,
I keep forgetting

29:59.791 --> 30:02.333
that he's only known me
for a couple weeks, right?

30:02.333 --> 30:04.916
I have this unfair advantage.

30:04.916 --> 30:06.666
- "There is advantage in
the wisdom won from pain."
Aeschylus.

30:08.958 --> 30:10.958
- I'm jumping the gun.
I'm expecting him to be
where I'm at,

30:10.958 --> 30:13.958
and he probably doesn't
even know my last name.

30:13.958 --> 30:16.500
- Oh, I don't know, I think
"Strange" is a pretty
unforgettable surname.

30:17.750 --> 30:18.833
You want my advice?
- Yes.

30:18.833 --> 30:20.416
- Why don't you just
slow it all down--

30:20.416 --> 30:20.958
- Because--

30:20.958 --> 30:25.625
- Just allow things to unfold
naturally, you know?

30:25.625 --> 30:27.750
- Because if I do that,
then Claire, she swoops in

30:27.750 --> 30:30.125
and I'm right back
at square one.

30:30.125 --> 30:32.166
I mean, you should've seen him
today when he was with her.

30:32.166 --> 30:34.833
Just like two words
out of her mouth

30:34.833 --> 30:37.416
and he was melting like butter.

30:37.416 --> 30:39.708
- Must be the accent.
- Yeah, that and the fact
that Claire was...

30:39.708 --> 30:41.375
Uh, Claire is really adorable
back in '94.

30:42.875 --> 30:44.416
- Erica.
- Hi.

30:44.416 --> 30:45.833
- Oh, I'm sorry to interrupt,
I didn't...

30:45.833 --> 30:48.166
- Oh, no-no, not at all.
Remember, I want those 10 pages

30:48.166 --> 30:50.208
on the concept of
"the leap of faith"

30:50.208 --> 30:52.625
in Kierkegaard's writings,
by Monday.

30:52.625 --> 30:54.708
- Yes, Professor Thomas.

30:57.000 --> 30:58.708
- So where's Ethan? I thought
you guys were rehearsing?

30:58.708 --> 31:00.458
- Uh, he had to go
to night class.

31:00.458 --> 31:02.625
- Oh.
- Mm-hmm.

31:02.625 --> 31:04.000
- Sexy scene you two
have together, huh?

31:04.000 --> 31:05.875
- Yeah, sexy is the word,
you know?

31:05.875 --> 31:08.583
And it doesn't hurt
acting opposite Ethan either.

31:08.583 --> 31:10.833
- Yeah. God, I can't believe
he's single.

31:10.833 --> 31:13.791
- Yeah, tell me about it.
- So he is single?

31:13.791 --> 31:16.041
He's not interested
in any girl? I mean...

31:16.041 --> 31:18.583
Because today, I don't know,
it felt like there was like a...

31:18.583 --> 31:20.541
a spark between us.
- Really, a spark?

31:20.541 --> 31:21.916
Well, um, are you sure?
- Yeah.

31:21.916 --> 31:24.208
- Because, you know, Claire...

31:24.208 --> 31:26.500
Ethan, he's a really
sensitive guy.

31:26.500 --> 31:28.541
- Oh, but I like sensitive men.
I'm French.

31:28.541 --> 31:30.250
- I don't think that
you're his type.

31:31.416 --> 31:33.250
- Oh yeah? What make you think
I'm not his type?

31:33.250 --> 31:35.083
- I just do, and you're not.

31:35.083 --> 31:37.083
I mean, you might think so,
but long-term?

31:37.083 --> 31:38.416
(Negative sound)

31:39.125 --> 31:43.541
- Okay. Well, maybe it's time
I go and find that out myself.

31:43.541 --> 31:46.000
- You know, I-I just--
I wouldn't do that.

31:46.000 --> 31:48.625
- Why not?
- Because.

31:48.625 --> 31:51.000
- Because what?
- Because um...

31:51.000 --> 31:53.791
Ethan... is gay.

31:55.833 --> 31:58.208
- What?
- Mm-hmm. And I don't wanna be
the one to gossip about it,

31:58.208 --> 32:00.208
but just the way that he is,
you know, in our scenes

32:00.208 --> 32:02.250
when it comes to all
the kissing stuff in the scene.

32:02.250 --> 32:03.875
The fact that
he's in drama class.

32:03.875 --> 32:05.333
I mean, kind of gay.

32:05.333 --> 32:08.166
Wow, I never would've suspected.

32:08.166 --> 32:10.291
- Yeah, I know.
I feel your pain, I do.

32:10.291 --> 32:12.666
And you just- you know what?
Forget about him.

32:12.666 --> 32:14.791
Go out and... and find
a nice straight guy.

32:21.833 --> 32:24.166
Claire: (Dramatic acting)
Oh, come, you spirits

32:24.166 --> 32:26.416
that tend on mortal thoughts.

32:28.041 --> 32:31.583
Un-sex me here and fill me
from the crown

32:31.583 --> 32:34.375
to the toe topful
of direst cruelty!

32:36.458 --> 32:38.458
Class: (Applauding)

32:38.458 --> 32:40.708
- Well done.

32:40.708 --> 32:43.625
And? Who shall present next?

32:43.625 --> 32:45.416
Erica and Ethan?

32:47.708 --> 32:49.166
- (Clears throat) You ready?

32:49.166 --> 32:50.916
- Oh, I'm something.

32:55.125 --> 32:58.250
- As sweet repose and rest
comes to thy heart

32:58.250 --> 33:00.583
as that within my breast!

33:00.583 --> 33:03.250
- Wilt thou leave me
so unsatisfied?

33:03.250 --> 33:06.083
- What satisfaction
canst thou have tonight?

33:06.083 --> 33:09.083
- The exchange of thy love's
faithful vow for mine.

33:09.083 --> 33:12.000
- But I gave thee mine
before thou did request it

33:12.000 --> 33:14.166
and yet I would,
it were to give again.

33:14.166 --> 33:16.916
- Wouldst thou withdraw it?
For what purpose, love?

33:16.916 --> 33:18.875
- But to be frank
and give it thee again.

33:20.375 --> 33:21.708
(Orchestra music swells)

33:23.166 --> 33:32.250
♪ ♪

33:32.250 --> 33:33.541
- (Clears throat)

33:35.583 --> 33:36.916
- Um... Uh...

33:38.541 --> 33:40.750
Yet... I wish for,
but the thing I have.

33:43.250 --> 33:46.083
My bounty is as boundless
as the sea,

33:47.541 --> 33:48.875
my love is deep;

33:50.500 --> 33:52.125
for the more I give thee,
the more I have,

33:53.208 --> 33:55.166
for both are infinite.

33:55.166 --> 33:57.041
(Applause)

33:57.041 --> 33:58.875
- Bravo! Bravo!

34:01.833 --> 34:05.750
- Congratulations on
all your performances.

34:05.750 --> 34:08.541
There was murder,
intrigue, love.

34:10.166 --> 34:11.708
You should all be very proud
of yourselves.

34:13.166 --> 34:14.541
(Applauding)

34:14.541 --> 34:15.958
Class dismissed.

34:18.083 --> 34:20.541
- No, that was good.
You were-you were great.
- (Giggling)

34:22.083 --> 34:23.500
- That was really good.
You did it.

34:23.500 --> 34:25.916
- Um, Ethan! Hey!
- Hey.

34:25.916 --> 34:27.958
- Uh, just now, I mean...
on stage,

34:29.666 --> 34:32.083
not that I'm complaining
at all, but...

34:32.083 --> 34:34.250
I mean, you said that you
weren't gonna do the kiss,

34:34.250 --> 34:36.625
so... why did you do the kiss?

34:38.125 --> 34:39.875
- To prove to you...

34:39.875 --> 34:42.166
that I, Ethan Wakefield,
am not gay.

34:42.166 --> 34:43.625
You know, I should be
really mad at you

34:43.625 --> 34:46.041
for spreading that little rumor.

34:46.041 --> 34:48.416
- I, I...
- No-no-no, I get it,
I'm a guy in drama

34:48.416 --> 34:50.166
and I kind of freaked out
when you kissed me.

34:50.166 --> 34:52.625
- I am so sorry, Ethan.
- It's an honest mistake.

34:52.625 --> 34:54.208
- So, you don't--
I mean, you don't hate me?

34:54.208 --> 34:56.500
- I did at first, but, um...

34:58.083 --> 35:00.916
I owe you.
- For what?

35:00.916 --> 35:02.541
Your crazy rumor was a
definite conversation starter
with Claire.

35:02.541 --> 35:05.166
When I cleared everything up,
she asked me out on a date.

35:05.166 --> 35:06.833
That's because of you.
- (Tight-lipped) Oh.

35:06.833 --> 35:08.583
- So, buds?

35:08.583 --> 35:10.750
- (Sighs) Buds.

35:12.208 --> 35:13.833
- See you soon.

35:17.708 --> 35:19.875
- No, Ethan! Ethan, wait!

35:19.875 --> 35:21.791
(Whoosh) Oh, sorry.

35:25.125 --> 35:26.958
Oh, God.

35:26.958 --> 35:28.541
(Breathing hard)

35:34.250 --> 35:35.833
- Well, let me guess.

35:35.833 --> 35:38.000
Andrea's still on stage
with Katie,

35:38.000 --> 35:39.916
chipping away at your promotion,

35:39.916 --> 35:42.250
bit by naughty bit,
and Ethan is uh...

35:42.250 --> 35:44.375
Hey, wh-where's Ethan?

35:44.375 --> 35:46.041
- Dr. Tom, you know
where Ethan is.

35:46.041 --> 35:47.791
Ethan is with Claire.

35:47.791 --> 35:49.416
- Oh, really?
'Cause you know what?

35:49.416 --> 35:51.291
I thought for sure
that when you went back
to change history,

35:52.791 --> 35:54.666
that history would have changed.

35:54.666 --> 35:56.125
- History or fate?

35:56.125 --> 35:57.833
- Ugh, Erica. Now, come on,

35:57.833 --> 35:59.958
you should know better
than anyone at this point

35:59.958 --> 36:02.000
that there's no such thing
as fate.

36:02.000 --> 36:04.375
- But Ethan and Claire,
they're clearly meant
to be together

36:04.375 --> 36:05.875
and I couldn't stop it.

36:05.875 --> 36:08.458
- Oh, "Men in the game
are blind

36:08.458 --> 36:10.125
to what men looking on
see clearly."

36:11.791 --> 36:13.166
Chinese proverb.
- Okay, so fine, I am blind.

36:15.000 --> 36:17.958
Open my eyes.

36:17.958 --> 36:19.833
- Okay, well...

36:19.833 --> 36:23.125
five months ago,
Ethan wanted to kiss you.

36:23.125 --> 36:24.666
Right?

36:24.666 --> 36:26.750
And in 1994, Ethan wanted to be
with Claire.

36:29.375 --> 36:31.166
So...

36:31.166 --> 36:33.250
what is the common
denominator here?

36:34.875 --> 36:37.416
- Ethan.
- Yeah, Ethan.

36:37.416 --> 36:40.041
Yeah, he is as much a part
of the equation as you are,
you know.

36:41.125 --> 36:43.250
People are not islands.

36:43.250 --> 36:46.166
We are not separate
or on our own,

36:47.708 --> 36:50.083
we are in this... together.

36:52.458 --> 36:54.750
And so, your actions
affect Ethan

36:54.750 --> 36:56.666
and Ethan's actions affect you

36:56.666 --> 36:59.291
and on, and on, and on.

36:59.291 --> 37:02.125
So it's not that you
couldn't change fate;

37:02.125 --> 37:05.791
it's that you can't make other
peoples' decisions for them.

37:05.791 --> 37:07.250
- So what does Ethan want now?

37:07.250 --> 37:08.958
- Well, only Ethan
can tell you that.

37:08.958 --> 37:11.250
But first things first, I would
go in and ask for some help,

37:11.250 --> 37:14.041
because, boy, do you need it!

37:18.291 --> 37:19.791
- That's the thing!

37:19.791 --> 37:22.541
He seemed like a total
gentleman.

37:22.541 --> 37:24.125
Now I'm thinking to myself,

37:24.125 --> 37:26.625
well, this guy could be
the one.

37:28.125 --> 37:29.666
- Okay... a-a-and then?

37:29.666 --> 37:32.333
- And then he gets me back
to his place,

37:32.333 --> 37:35.000
and dude pulls out
a feather duster.

37:35.000 --> 37:38.833
Tells me he's into something
called "domestic discipline."

37:38.833 --> 37:40.791
So kinky, but whatever,
I'm open minded.

37:43.000 --> 37:44.916
So I get up on his armchair,

37:44.916 --> 37:47.250
like he tells me to. Like this.

37:47.250 --> 37:49.583
- Oh. (Nervous laugh)
- (Laughing) So I'm up here
like this,

37:49.583 --> 37:51.416
and he gets me to dust
the wall behind it.

37:51.416 --> 37:53.500
So I'm dusting away,
La-la-la-la-la,

37:53.500 --> 37:55.041
and then he starts
smacking my ass.

37:57.333 --> 37:59.833
I'm dusting... (laughing)
and he smacks... (laughing)

37:59.833 --> 38:02.416
I'm dusting.
and he's smacking away.

38:02.416 --> 38:05.333
(Snorted laughter)

38:05.333 --> 38:08.333
- Classy.
Andrea: Slaps my ass!

38:08.333 --> 38:10.958
- Brent!
- Talk to the hand because
the Brent isn't listening.

38:10.958 --> 38:12.541
- I need your help, Brent.
I really do.

38:12.541 --> 38:14.583
- I tried to help you,
you pushed me away.

38:14.583 --> 38:16.625
So why should I help you now?

38:16.625 --> 38:18.666
- Because I thought that
I could do it all.

38:18.666 --> 38:21.291
Because I was so determined
to make today perfect

38:21.291 --> 38:23.000
that I just got lost
in the details,

38:23.000 --> 38:25.416
and I refused to respect
anyone else's opinion

38:25.416 --> 38:27.208
other than my own?

38:27.208 --> 38:28.750
- And?

38:28.750 --> 38:30.416
- And I was a total, insane,
control freak.

38:30.416 --> 38:33.041
- Bingo. All right,
I will work my magic,

38:33.041 --> 38:34.583
but on one condition:

38:34.583 --> 38:36.083
you do everything I tell you,
no questions asked.

38:36.083 --> 38:38.041
- I promise.
- Good.

38:38.041 --> 38:39.375
All right.
Now, let's get up on stage.

38:39.375 --> 38:41.708
Andrea: (Snorts) Is that weird?

38:41.708 --> 38:43.750
- If this book is your life
then... let's hear it.

38:46.416 --> 38:48.333
- 'Kay.
- Whoa. That domestic
discipline thing,

38:48.333 --> 38:51.125
is there a website?
- (Squeal of urgency)
Oh, come on.

38:51.125 --> 38:53.250
- The life of a single girl,
huh, Katie? Oh.

38:54.833 --> 38:56.625
- And on that charming note,
scene.

38:56.625 --> 38:59.416
What you just witnessed
is every man's nightmare.

38:59.416 --> 39:01.708
An over-sexed, slightly
desperate young woman--

39:01.708 --> 39:05.500
- Excuse me?
- Willing to suffer date
after soul-crushing date

39:05.500 --> 39:07.083
just to find the one.

39:07.083 --> 39:09.458
She is a victim of every single
30-something dating book

39:09.458 --> 39:11.125
that's ever been written.

39:11.125 --> 39:12.666
Until now.

39:12.666 --> 39:15.208
Because "The None"
is none of that.

39:15.208 --> 39:17.416
The "The None" is something new,

39:17.416 --> 39:19.000
something groundbreaking.

39:19.000 --> 39:21.416
Something... Erica Strange.

39:21.416 --> 39:23.208
(Applause)

39:26.041 --> 39:28.166
- Who do you think you are?
- Your destiny.

39:28.166 --> 39:31.125
You free tonight?
- No.

39:31.125 --> 39:32.875
Maybe I could be.
- Hmm.

39:36.416 --> 39:39.458
- Well, I hope you enjoyed
our little pre-show,

39:39.458 --> 39:42.083
but Erica here is actually the
inspiration for my new book.

39:44.208 --> 39:46.916
An incredible woman
who deserves an incredible man,

39:48.541 --> 39:50.625
but who has so far been
unlucky in love.

39:50.625 --> 39:53.666
- Not that I haven't had my fair
share of opportunities though.

39:53.666 --> 39:56.666
- Why do you think
you're still single?

39:56.666 --> 39:58.500
- You know what? It's this...

39:58.500 --> 40:01.250
rabid desire, you know,
to find "the one."

40:01.250 --> 40:03.416
It-it sounds like
it's about the guy,

40:03.416 --> 40:05.666
but really it's about the girl.

40:05.666 --> 40:08.083
- How do you mean?

40:08.083 --> 40:10.125
- Well, it's the expectations
we have, you know?

40:10.125 --> 40:12.125
It cuts the male right out
of the equation

40:12.125 --> 40:16.375
because any good relationship,
it's about both people.

40:16.375 --> 40:18.416
Katie: You mean you've spent
so many years

40:18.416 --> 40:19.958
going after what you want,

40:19.958 --> 40:22.125
that you forgot that half
of the relationship

40:22.125 --> 40:23.958
is actually in somebody
else's hands.

40:23.958 --> 40:25.541
- Yeah. Exactly, exactly.

40:25.541 --> 40:27.541
'Cause any true relationship,
it's never just about yourself,

40:29.208 --> 40:32.583
so... so if you can stop
looking at it like that

40:32.583 --> 40:35.166
and put aside your desire
to find the perfect man,

40:38.625 --> 40:40.500
you might just find the man
that's perfect for you.

40:43.208 --> 40:44.833
(Applause)

40:46.333 --> 40:47.916
- Oh. Thanks, Katie.

40:52.041 --> 40:53.458
- Okay, so those go
in the records room

40:53.458 --> 40:55.041
and if it's locked,
Brent has the key.

40:55.041 --> 40:57.625
- Okay. Look, I'm sorry if I...

40:57.625 --> 41:00.458
- Oh, Meeri, don't apologize
for anything.

41:00.458 --> 41:03.083
You did a great job today,
really. So thank you.

41:03.083 --> 41:04.916
- (Flattered gasp) Okay.

41:09.166 --> 41:10.541
Julianne: (Clears throat)

41:10.541 --> 41:11.875
Look down.

41:13.375 --> 41:16.333
Look down.

41:16.333 --> 41:19.625
- Oh my God.
- No guff.

41:19.625 --> 41:21.583
It wasn't too long ago
you were just a...

41:21.583 --> 41:24.250
a poorly-dressed girl
past her prime

41:24.250 --> 41:26.208
with a penchant for flip-flops.

41:26.208 --> 41:28.750
It's amazing what a few months
can do.

41:28.750 --> 41:30.791
- Is this for real?
Are you serious?

41:30.791 --> 41:33.250
- (Half laughs) I may be tough,
but I'm not unfair.

41:35.458 --> 41:38.125
You proved yourself today.
- Thank you.

41:38.125 --> 41:39.666
Uh, but, I mean,
I had a lot of help.

41:39.666 --> 41:41.625
Brent, of course,
was invaluable,

41:41.625 --> 41:43.541
and Meeri, she's--

41:43.541 --> 41:45.458
- It was a team effort
blah-blah-blah-blah-blah.

41:45.458 --> 41:47.625
You were the one in charge,
so enjoy it.

41:49.250 --> 41:51.166
Oh, we're gonna need
to find a new Erica.

41:51.166 --> 41:54.083
One who actually knows
how to brew a latte.

41:54.083 --> 41:55.416
- Definitely.

41:57.166 --> 41:59.041
- High-five. (Hands clap)

41:59.041 --> 42:01.458
- Thank you.

42:01.458 --> 42:03.750
There comes a day
when we suddenly realize

42:03.750 --> 42:05.375
that the control we seek

42:05.375 --> 42:09.583
will forever remain
just outside our grasp.

42:09.583 --> 42:11.625
For some,
it's a terrifying discovery.

42:14.458 --> 42:17.000
While for others,
it's strangely liberating.

42:18.583 --> 42:20.041
If the only person
I can control is me,

42:21.708 --> 42:23.791
that means I'm off the hook
for the other six billion souls

42:23.791 --> 42:26.000
making their way
in this crazy world.

42:28.375 --> 42:29.666
- Thank you. Mm-hmm.

42:31.166 --> 42:32.500
(Knock at the door)

42:32.500 --> 42:34.083
- Coming!

42:37.666 --> 42:40.666
- Hey.
- Hey. What happened
to knocking on my wall?

42:40.666 --> 42:42.541
- Can I come in?
- Where's Claire?

42:42.541 --> 42:45.000
- Montreal. Can I come in?

42:47.750 --> 42:49.375
(Door creaks shut)

42:51.000 --> 42:53.166
- What you said to me,
I-I didn't like it, Erica.

42:53.166 --> 42:54.666
- Well, I didn't like saying it.

42:54.666 --> 42:57.083
- But you did and...
and you weren't wrong.

42:59.708 --> 43:02.208
I was paralyzed, in a way.

43:02.208 --> 43:04.250
Claire held all the cards and...

43:04.250 --> 43:07.416
when she wanted me back, I...
- Yeah, you went. I know.

43:07.416 --> 43:09.291
- But I didn't, not really,
because you were right.

43:11.166 --> 43:14.041
If I really wanted her,
I'd be in Montreal.

43:15.666 --> 43:18.583
I wouldn't be here... with you.
