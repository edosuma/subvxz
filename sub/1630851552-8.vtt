00:07.966 --> 00:09.176
Hey, Otis!

00:09.259 --> 00:11.094
-Otis
-Otis!

00:11.178 --> 00:14.306
Let's get rolling with Otis

00:14.389 --> 00:15.641
Hit the brakes!

00:15.724 --> 00:17.559
-Otis
-Otis!

00:17.643 --> 00:20.729
Let's get rolling with Otis

00:20.812 --> 00:21.897
Let's get rolling!

00:21.980 --> 00:24.900
Together on the farm
We play and we work hard

00:24.983 --> 00:28.111
-With help from Otis the tractor
-Yeah!

00:28.195 --> 00:31.365
When he feels his heart glowing
Otis gets going

00:31.448 --> 00:34.576
-So let's get rolling with Otis
-Otis!

00:38.205 --> 00:39.957
"The Thankful Parade."

00:45.963 --> 00:48.715
All aboard the thankful parade!

00:49.341 --> 00:52.970
Today, today is the thankful parade

00:53.053 --> 00:56.348
Today, today is the thankful parade

00:56.431 --> 01:01.103
Yes, today
Today is the thankful parade

01:01.186 --> 01:03.981
It's time to share what makes you happy.

01:04.690 --> 01:08.485
Celeste
Celeste, we can't wait anymore

01:08.569 --> 01:11.989
What are you most thankful for?

01:12.823 --> 01:15.909
I'm so glad to have
these crunchy red apples.

01:16.785 --> 01:19.162
My favorite.

01:20.539 --> 01:22.040
Daisy, Daisy

01:22.124 --> 01:23.834
We can't wait anymore

01:23.917 --> 01:27.379
What are you most thankful for?

01:28.005 --> 01:31.717
I'm thankful for flowers
that smell so sweet.

01:37.014 --> 01:40.559
Louie, Louie, we can't wait anymore

01:40.642 --> 01:44.563
What are you most thankful for?

01:45.564 --> 01:47.024
My corn collection.

01:47.107 --> 01:51.320
I have yellow, dark yellow,
darker yellow and blue.

01:51.862 --> 01:54.364
-So many pretty colors.
-Wow, that's something.

01:55.532 --> 01:59.536
Today, today is the thankful parade

02:00.454 --> 02:02.456
Sal? Sal?

02:02.539 --> 02:04.333
We can't wait anymore

02:05.042 --> 02:06.752
Wait. Sal's not here.

02:06.835 --> 02:09.545
We can't have the thankful parade
without him.

02:09.630 --> 02:12.257
Wait here, and I'll see if I can find him.

02:12.341 --> 02:13.342
Thanks, Otis.

02:13.967 --> 02:15.844
Cock-a-doodle-boohoo.

02:15.928 --> 02:17.429
I can't do it.

02:17.513 --> 02:20.974
Hit the brakes. I think Sal needs help!

02:31.693 --> 02:33.946
Otis. Thank hay bales you're here.

02:34.029 --> 02:37.533
There you are, Sal.
You made this sculpture?

02:37.616 --> 02:41.954
Yep. This year I'm thankful for art.

02:42.829 --> 02:46.917
There's just one teensy tiny problem.

02:47.000 --> 02:49.628
There's nothing teensy tiny about that.

02:50.295 --> 02:52.172
That's the problem.

02:52.256 --> 02:58.762
It's too tall to fit out the door.

03:10.232 --> 03:11.400
It's falling!

03:16.822 --> 03:20.784
Well, ruffle my feathers.
I'll never get it out of the barn.

03:22.160 --> 03:26.123
-But today--
-Today, today is the thankful parade

03:26.206 --> 03:30.961
And we can't wait to see what Sal made

03:32.212 --> 03:33.964
Come out, Sal, we need you.

03:35.966 --> 03:39.553
I guess you'll have to do
the thankful parade without me.

03:39.636 --> 03:40.971
I'm so upset.

03:43.891 --> 03:46.351
Can I try
getting it out of the barn for you?

03:47.144 --> 03:49.563
Yes, please. But how?

03:50.147 --> 03:53.233
I just have to use
the gears between my ears.

03:53.317 --> 03:54.568
Okay.

03:55.861 --> 03:59.239
What if we break it into smaller pieces?

03:59.323 --> 04:00.574
Break it?

04:00.657 --> 04:02.826
No, no, no!

04:02.910 --> 04:04.953
I've worked so hard on it.

04:05.037 --> 04:09.875
I'll never be able to get it to look
exactly like this again.

04:10.417 --> 04:15.380
Right. Okay.
So maybe we can just tilt it back.

04:18.257 --> 04:19.801
That might work.

04:19.885 --> 04:21.553
Let's get rolling.

04:22.095 --> 04:25.974
We can lean it like this
until it's low enough.

04:26.058 --> 04:30.062
Just be really, really careful.

04:30.145 --> 04:33.899
Putt, puff, puttedy chuff.

04:33.982 --> 04:37.611
Slow and steady, we won't give up.

04:37.694 --> 04:40.822
-Fluttering feathers. It's working.
-Whoo-moo!

04:40.906 --> 04:42.199
Almost there.

04:42.282 --> 04:43.825
Tilt it a little bit more.

04:43.909 --> 04:45.244
There you go.

04:45.327 --> 04:47.704
Careful. Careful.

04:47.788 --> 04:49.206
Look!

04:49.790 --> 04:52.084
Getting closer. Keep rolling.

04:52.167 --> 04:53.418
And…

04:55.587 --> 04:57.214
We cock-a-doodle-did it.

04:57.297 --> 05:00.008
I couldn't have gotten it out without you,
Otis.

05:00.717 --> 05:02.010
Happy to help, Sal.

05:02.094 --> 05:04.471
It's oink-cellent.

05:05.013 --> 05:06.014
What is it?

05:06.598 --> 05:08.851
Well, I'm thankful for art.

05:09.518 --> 05:10.727
So…

05:12.312 --> 05:17.651
Without feather ado, I present to you my…

05:18.610 --> 05:19.903
One second.

05:21.655 --> 05:25.659
I just have to make a little adjustment.

05:31.540 --> 05:33.625
Hit the brakes. Your sculpture.

05:34.168 --> 05:36.712
Was it supposed to do that?

05:38.422 --> 05:39.715
No.

05:40.757 --> 05:44.428
I wanted to show the farm
that I'm thankful for art.

05:44.511 --> 05:46.972
And I worked so hard on it.

05:47.556 --> 05:50.893
But now it's ruined.

05:50.976 --> 05:54.980
And without my art,
I can't be in the thankful parade anymore.

05:55.480 --> 05:57.191
I'm so sad.

06:01.486 --> 06:03.530
Maybe you can remake your sculpture.

06:04.448 --> 06:06.158
I don't think so, Otis.

06:06.742 --> 06:10.078
I stayed up all night working on it.

06:10.162 --> 06:13.123
There's not enough time to remake it now.

06:13.207 --> 06:14.499
Well…

06:15.083 --> 06:16.919
Could you make something else?

06:17.628 --> 06:21.840
Maybe something stronger
that won't break this time.

06:22.925 --> 06:24.718
But I don't know what to make.

06:25.302 --> 06:26.303
I can help you.

06:26.386 --> 06:27.846
-We'll help too.
-Count me in.

06:27.930 --> 06:29.139
I wanna help.

06:29.223 --> 06:31.600
But the parade's gonna start soon.

06:31.683 --> 06:33.852
We won't start the parade without you.

06:33.936 --> 06:34.937
Right, everyone?

06:35.020 --> 06:36.021
Right.

06:36.104 --> 06:38.190
-I'll grab the flowers.
-I'll get the straw.

06:38.273 --> 06:39.566
Let's do this.

06:39.650 --> 06:41.109
So, what do you say, Sal?

06:41.652 --> 06:46.698
Well, I guess I say, "Okay, let's try!"

06:48.575 --> 06:50.410
Cock-a-doodle-whoo-hoo!

06:50.494 --> 06:52.871
Okay. Okay. What do we got?

06:53.455 --> 06:55.249
Maybe I can use this.

06:55.332 --> 06:56.333
No.

06:58.836 --> 07:00.295
How about that?

07:00.379 --> 07:02.089
Nah. It'll never work.

07:07.052 --> 07:10.597
Can you search a little more neatly,
please?

07:11.265 --> 07:13.100
What are you thinking, Sal?

07:16.979 --> 07:19.147
Great gears. I've got it.

07:20.190 --> 07:21.275
You do?

07:23.151 --> 07:24.945
This barrel is super sturdy.

07:25.946 --> 07:27.739
Could you make something out of this?

07:29.741 --> 07:31.785
Barrel art. Brilliant!

07:33.579 --> 07:35.497
Wait a second.

07:37.291 --> 07:40.878
I'll take this and put it right here,
like that.

07:40.961 --> 07:41.962
Yes.

07:42.045 --> 07:44.006
This'll cock-a-doodle-do.

07:44.089 --> 07:45.465
Wait till you see it.

07:45.549 --> 07:47.509
I know what I'm going to make.

07:48.010 --> 07:51.597
We've got a lot to do.
Could you help me find some more paint?

07:51.680 --> 07:55.517
I'll be back faster
than you can say "cock-a-doodle-do."

07:55.601 --> 07:56.685
-I'll help too.
-Me too.

07:56.768 --> 07:58.187
I can grab some paint.

08:00.814 --> 08:03.400
I know it's in here somewhere.

08:07.988 --> 08:09.615
That's a whole lot of cans.

08:09.698 --> 08:11.033
Let's bring it to Sal.

08:11.116 --> 08:12.826
That'll do.

08:12.910 --> 08:14.328
Now I just need some more--

08:14.411 --> 08:16.830
Paint! We found paint!

08:18.415 --> 08:22.044
Every color in the rainbow.
Just like your sculpture.

08:22.127 --> 08:23.921
What do you think, Sal?

08:24.004 --> 08:26.048
I think-- I think--

08:26.798 --> 08:30.719
I think you're the heartiest helper who
has ever helped anyone with their heart.

08:30.802 --> 08:32.846
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

08:32.929 --> 08:35.640
-Now let's get painting.
-Whoo-moo!

08:35.724 --> 08:37.142
-Let's do this.
-Yeah!

08:38.059 --> 08:39.227
And a little…

08:41.313 --> 08:42.940
Just swoosh.

08:43.023 --> 08:44.107
Yeah.

08:46.443 --> 08:48.487
Just needs a little bit of red.

08:50.322 --> 08:51.323
Here you go, Sal.

08:52.616 --> 08:54.117
Cock-a-doodle-thank you.

08:57.329 --> 08:59.081
-Can I see?
-Is it ready?

08:59.164 --> 09:00.165
Are you done?

09:00.249 --> 09:01.500
Not yet.

09:01.583 --> 09:03.877
But you're gonna love it.

09:03.961 --> 09:07.631
But it still needs something.

09:09.341 --> 09:10.968
Right here in the middle.

09:11.593 --> 09:14.513
Okay. Everybody, close your eyes.

09:17.140 --> 09:19.685
I just need a little help from you, Otis.

09:19.768 --> 09:21.520
But no peeking.

09:22.563 --> 09:23.939
You got it, Sal.

09:28.068 --> 09:30.070
Roll right over here.

09:31.697 --> 09:33.824
Just a little closer.

09:33.907 --> 09:35.742
A little bit more.

09:36.994 --> 09:38.078
There.

09:38.161 --> 09:40.539
Everyone, open your eyes.

09:41.874 --> 09:43.125
Voilà.

09:43.208 --> 09:44.877
It's you, Otis.

09:44.960 --> 09:45.961
Me?

09:46.044 --> 09:47.337
-Oh, yeah!
-Look!

09:47.421 --> 09:48.589
There are your eyes.

09:49.089 --> 09:51.091
And right here is your steam pipe.

09:51.175 --> 09:53.760
And, of course, your nose.

09:53.844 --> 09:54.845
You're right!

09:54.928 --> 09:56.263
-Yeah!
-I see it now.

09:57.097 --> 09:59.183
I'm thankful for art,

09:59.266 --> 10:03.353
but I'm also thankful for you
and all your help, Otis.

10:03.437 --> 10:05.522
I am one happy rooster.

10:07.691 --> 10:09.484
I'm happy too, Sal.

10:09.568 --> 10:12.154
Now, let's get this on your wagon.

10:12.738 --> 10:15.574
Yay! Now we can start the parade!

10:16.116 --> 10:18.243
I just need to get one more thing.

10:25.083 --> 10:26.752
My wagon.

10:28.337 --> 10:31.173
But there's nothing inside.

10:31.256 --> 10:32.549
Not yet.

10:33.133 --> 10:34.760
Otis, Otis

10:34.843 --> 10:36.803
We can't wait anymore

10:36.887 --> 10:40.599
What are you most thankful for?

10:40.682 --> 10:44.394
That's easy.
I'm thankful for all my friends.

10:45.562 --> 10:46.980
Us?

10:47.064 --> 10:50.067
Uh-huh. Hop in.

10:52.861 --> 10:54.863
-Let's get moo-ving!
-Yeah!

10:54.947 --> 10:56.365
-Go, Otis, go!
-Yay!

10:58.742 --> 11:02.412
Now the thankful parade
Can really begin

11:02.496 --> 11:05.999
Let's take these wagons for a spin

11:06.083 --> 11:07.334
Look, Mama!

11:08.836 --> 11:12.089
Today, today is the thankful parade

11:12.172 --> 11:15.843
Yes, today
Today is our thankful parade

11:15.926 --> 11:17.553
Cock-a-doodle-whoo-hoo.

11:17.636 --> 11:19.012
Yeah!

11:20.097 --> 11:22.516
Thanks for helping me with my art, Otis.

11:23.183 --> 11:26.019
On this farm, we all help each other.

11:26.645 --> 11:29.773
Today, today is the thankful parade

11:29.857 --> 11:34.152
Yes, today
Today is our thankful parade

11:38.907 --> 11:40.701
"Hay Day Hay Maze."

11:43.579 --> 11:46.248
It's Hay Day,
and there's still so much to do.

11:46.331 --> 11:49.251
Snacks, decorations, hayrides.

11:49.334 --> 11:52.754
Over here, we have pumpkins
and apples

11:52.838 --> 11:54.923
and more pumpkins.

11:59.845 --> 12:03.432
There you go, Kevin.
Ready to give everyone hayrides?

12:03.515 --> 12:05.142
Thanks to you, I am.

12:05.225 --> 12:08.854
Hey, Celeste. How about a test drive
around the farmyard?

12:08.937 --> 12:11.023
My very own hayride?

12:11.106 --> 12:12.357
Yay hay!

12:13.233 --> 12:14.359
Sooey!

12:15.444 --> 12:16.695
Hang on tight.

12:19.656 --> 12:21.408
This is oink-cellent.

12:21.491 --> 12:23.577
Big K coming through.

12:24.161 --> 12:26.330
We're going so fast.

12:28.165 --> 12:30.209
Happy Hay Day, everyone.

12:31.043 --> 12:32.044
Okay.

12:33.795 --> 12:35.672
I just love hayrides.

12:35.756 --> 12:37.382
I'm so happy it's Hay Day.

12:38.967 --> 12:41.094
A whole day to celebrate fall.

12:41.178 --> 12:43.305
I can't wait for the Hay Day snacks.

12:45.724 --> 12:48.894
Come on, Polly-pup.
Let's grab the rest of the decorations.

12:54.399 --> 12:56.902
Looks like you just got
a little Hay Day snack.

12:58.904 --> 13:01.198
Whoops. Berries on the loose.

13:01.281 --> 13:02.866
Happy Hay Day, Elaine.

13:02.950 --> 13:04.368
Happy Hay Day, Otis.

13:04.451 --> 13:05.661
You too, Polly.

13:06.995 --> 13:09.122
Gotta get these berries
to the snack stand.

13:12.042 --> 13:15.128
You can have more later, Polly.
Gotta go.

13:15.212 --> 13:19.216
Hay Day is about to baa-gin.
Let's get those paper chains up.

13:20.551 --> 13:23.595
I'll hang 'em
before you can say "Hay Day."

13:24.721 --> 13:26.723
Baa-eautiful.

13:27.516 --> 13:29.184
Happy Hay Day, Celeste.

13:30.227 --> 13:31.603
Hay Day is the best.

13:31.687 --> 13:33.605
And there's still more to see.

13:33.689 --> 13:37.025
Yeah.
Wait till you see the hay maze, Kevin.

13:37.109 --> 13:39.278
A hay maze? Awesome!

13:40.904 --> 13:42.322
What's a hay maze?

13:42.823 --> 13:44.658
That is a hay maze.

13:45.284 --> 13:47.119
Pretty cock-a-doodle-cool, huh?

13:49.496 --> 13:52.249
I've never been in a hay maze before.

13:53.125 --> 13:54.376
Wait till you try it.

13:54.459 --> 13:59.548
I love trying to find my way
through the windy, twisty path.

14:01.175 --> 14:03.260
I gotta check out this maze.

14:04.511 --> 14:05.596
Whoa, Kevin.

14:05.679 --> 14:07.764
You shouldn't go in there by yourself.

14:07.848 --> 14:10.267
You can get lost really fast.

14:10.350 --> 14:11.768
We'll go in with you.

14:11.852 --> 14:14.855
We just have to finish
putting up these decorations first.

14:15.939 --> 14:18.817
I love decorating. I'll help.

14:19.735 --> 14:20.819
Be right back.

14:26.450 --> 14:27.492
You know what?

14:28.410 --> 14:29.411
I got this.

14:31.163 --> 14:32.873
Yeah!

14:35.667 --> 14:37.211
This isn't so bad.

14:37.294 --> 14:39.379
I'll find my way out in no time.

14:43.759 --> 14:45.344
Just gotta turn this way.

14:46.470 --> 14:48.388
Or maybe this way.

14:53.936 --> 14:55.229
A dead end.

14:58.190 --> 14:59.191
Oh, no!

14:59.900 --> 15:01.109
I'm lost!

15:11.787 --> 15:13.163
Okay, Polly-pup.

15:13.247 --> 15:16.542
Just a few more paper chains.
Then we can try out that hay maze.

15:17.042 --> 15:19.294
Help! I'm lost!

15:19.378 --> 15:21.588
Hit the brakes. Listen.

15:21.672 --> 15:23.298
I'm stuck in the maze!

15:24.383 --> 15:27.386
That's Kevin. Come on!

15:32.099 --> 15:33.225
Help!

15:34.810 --> 15:37.604
Somebody? Anybody?

15:37.688 --> 15:39.565
Kevin! Are you okay?

15:39.648 --> 15:42.484
Otis! I can't find my way out.

15:42.568 --> 15:45.404
Kevin! Where are you, Kevin?

15:45.487 --> 15:47.573
Louie, is it hayride time?

15:47.656 --> 15:49.199
Is it? Is it? Is it?

15:49.283 --> 15:50.951
Not if we can't find Kevin.

15:51.910 --> 15:53.996
Kevin!

15:54.079 --> 15:55.873
I can't miss the hayrides.

15:55.956 --> 15:58.417
I've been practicing for weeks.

15:58.500 --> 16:00.627
Otis, can you help?

16:00.711 --> 16:02.880
This is so frustrating.

16:05.299 --> 16:08.093
We'll think of a way
to get you out of there, Kevin.

16:08.177 --> 16:09.845
Please think fast.

16:09.928 --> 16:10.929
Okay.

16:11.013 --> 16:13.640
Putt, puff, puttedy pink.

16:13.724 --> 16:16.518
I need to take a deep breath and think.

16:22.691 --> 16:24.109
What is it, Polly?

16:29.281 --> 16:31.200
Bouncing berries, that's it!

16:31.283 --> 16:33.243
Elaine, we need your help.

16:33.327 --> 16:36.246
Okay. What can I do for you, Otis?

16:36.330 --> 16:37.915
Kevin's lost in the maze.

16:37.998 --> 16:41.293
But if you go in
and leave a trail of berries…

16:41.960 --> 16:45.714
We can find Kevin
and follow the berry trail out. Gotcha.

16:47.841 --> 16:50.135
You and Sal can go in together.

16:50.219 --> 16:53.555
I'll stay here with Polly
in case Kevin comes back out.

16:53.639 --> 16:55.098
Let's get rolling.

16:55.182 --> 16:57.142
-Got it.
-Sounds like a plan.

16:58.936 --> 17:00.229
Kevin!

17:00.312 --> 17:01.313
Hello.

17:01.396 --> 17:02.731
Kevin!

17:02.814 --> 17:03.815
Kevin!

17:03.899 --> 17:04.900
Hello?

17:04.983 --> 17:05.983
Hello?

17:06.068 --> 17:07.903
Kevin.

17:07.986 --> 17:10.489
Yoo-hoo. Where are you?

17:11.448 --> 17:13.200
A few berries here.

17:15.911 --> 17:17.538
Elaine? Sal?

17:18.121 --> 17:19.580
Kevin.

17:19.665 --> 17:20.790
I'm over here.

17:21.500 --> 17:24.586
We hear you.
We hear you. We're coming.

17:24.670 --> 17:26.296
I hear you too.

17:27.297 --> 17:29.216
Is he here?

17:30.300 --> 17:31.301
Nope.

17:31.385 --> 17:34.137
You can find him. Keep on rolling.

17:36.557 --> 17:39.935
Okay, Otis. Let's go back the other way.

17:41.603 --> 17:43.355
Where are they?

17:44.231 --> 17:45.524
Can't forget the berries.

17:57.202 --> 18:00.455
Kevin, where are you?

18:00.539 --> 18:01.832
I'm over here.

18:03.500 --> 18:05.210
-Elaine?
-Kevin?

18:06.295 --> 18:07.462
Kevin!

18:07.546 --> 18:11.842
Sal! Elaine!
You're a sight for sore headlights.

18:11.925 --> 18:13.969
Otis, we found Kevin.

18:14.595 --> 18:15.804
You did it!

18:16.388 --> 18:18.932
I'm so happy, I'm leaping and beeping.

18:19.892 --> 18:22.394
Now get rolling back out of there.

18:22.477 --> 18:25.355
You got it. Just tell me how.

18:25.439 --> 18:27.733
We just follow this berry trail.

18:28.358 --> 18:29.860
Right this way.

18:29.943 --> 18:31.862
We'll be out of here in no time.

18:31.945 --> 18:35.866
The trick to making a good
berry trail is having lots of berries.

18:35.949 --> 18:38.076
There's more over here. Come on.

18:48.587 --> 18:50.464
The crows ate all the berries.

18:50.547 --> 18:52.799
We'll never find our way out now.

18:52.883 --> 18:54.426
We're really worried, Otis.

18:58.347 --> 19:00.015
We'll think of something.

19:00.599 --> 19:02.559
Kevin!

19:03.977 --> 19:07.773
There's a line forming.
We need you to start those hayrides.

19:07.856 --> 19:11.985
We got to get out of here.
I have to do my hayrides.

19:12.069 --> 19:14.988
And fast.
While my berries are still farm fresh.

19:16.448 --> 19:18.283
Are they still farm fresh, Sal?

19:19.993 --> 19:20.994
Yep.

19:22.663 --> 19:23.997
Let me check one more time.

19:26.375 --> 19:27.459
Yep.

19:28.544 --> 19:31.255
This is awful. What are we gonna do?

19:32.089 --> 19:34.675
If there's a way in, there's a way out.

19:34.758 --> 19:36.426
We just need to think.

19:37.302 --> 19:40.305
-Okay. Thanks, Otis.
-Please hurry.

19:46.979 --> 19:48.146
Great gears.

19:48.730 --> 19:50.274
I have an idea.

19:51.108 --> 19:53.610
He has an idea. He has an idea.

19:56.113 --> 19:59.283
Polly, can you put this paper chain
in my hatch, please?

20:03.161 --> 20:06.331
Thanks. Now let's go in there
and find our friends.

20:08.041 --> 20:10.335
Kevin, Elaine, Sal.

20:10.419 --> 20:12.629
Don't move. I'll come to you.

20:12.713 --> 20:15.507
Wait! How will you find us?

20:16.133 --> 20:17.634
With your voices.

20:17.718 --> 20:19.094
Ready to make some noise?

20:19.178 --> 20:20.637
-Oh, yeah.
-You know it.

20:20.721 --> 20:24.641
-Cock-a-doodle-do.
-Then let's get rolling.

20:26.059 --> 20:28.645
If you're stuck in the hay
Say hay, hay

20:28.729 --> 20:29.980
Hay, hay!

20:31.023 --> 20:33.901
If you're stuck in the hay
Say hay, hay

20:33.984 --> 20:35.235
Hay, hay!

20:35.319 --> 20:38.071
If you're stuck in the hay
Say hay, hay

20:38.155 --> 20:39.865
Hay, hay!

20:40.616 --> 20:42.117
That's not the way.

20:42.201 --> 20:44.620
If you're stuck in the hay
Say hay, hay

20:44.703 --> 20:46.288
Hay, hay!

20:47.247 --> 20:48.290
That way!

20:49.583 --> 20:52.377
If you're stuck in the hay
Say hay, hay

20:52.461 --> 20:54.046
Hay, hay!

20:54.129 --> 20:57.007
If you're stuck in the hay
Say hay, hay

20:57.090 --> 20:58.175
Hay, hay!

20:59.134 --> 21:01.720
If you're stuck in the hay
Say hay, hay

21:01.803 --> 21:03.222
-Hay, hay!
-Yes!

21:03.805 --> 21:06.266
Hey! You found us.

21:06.350 --> 21:07.559
Hi, everyone.

21:07.643 --> 21:09.269
Cock-a-doodle-whoo-hoo!

21:10.896 --> 21:13.398
But how will we all get out?

21:14.191 --> 21:16.944
All we have to do is follow that chain.

21:19.196 --> 21:22.074
If you're leaving the hay
Say hay, hay, hooray

21:22.157 --> 21:23.867
Hay, hay, hooray!

21:23.951 --> 21:27.079
If you're leaving the hay
Say hay, hay, hooray

21:27.162 --> 21:28.747
Hay, hay, hooray!

21:29.331 --> 21:32.334
If you're leaving the hay
Say hay, hay, hooray

21:32.417 --> 21:34.294
Hay, hay, hooray!

21:34.378 --> 21:36.088
We made it out!

21:36.171 --> 21:38.882
Kevin, you're baa-ck!

21:40.133 --> 21:43.846
Wow, that rescue was amazing, Otis.

21:44.429 --> 21:47.766
That's the last time
I'll go in a hay maze by myself.

21:47.850 --> 21:50.352
Thanks for helping us get out of there,
Otis.

21:50.435 --> 21:52.062
Any time, Elaine.

21:52.145 --> 21:54.439
And now, I have a delivery to make.

21:55.315 --> 21:58.819
Yoo-hoo! Get your farm fresh berries here.

21:59.528 --> 22:01.780
Now, who wants a hayride?

22:01.864 --> 22:02.865
-I do!
-Me!

22:04.074 --> 22:07.077
-Let's get trucking.
-I can't wait.

22:07.160 --> 22:10.205
-This is gonna be fun.
-This is oink-cellent.

22:14.293 --> 22:16.837
Bumpety bump, bumpety bump. Sooey!

22:19.214 --> 22:23.177
I'm so glad to be out of that maze
and giving hayrides.

22:25.637 --> 22:27.472
Glad to hear it, Kevin.

22:27.556 --> 22:29.892
I couldn't have done it without you, Otis.

22:29.975 --> 22:32.561
On this farm, we all help each other.
