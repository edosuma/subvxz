00:21.063 --> 00:22.231
Hi.

00:22.314 --> 00:24.316
It's a lovely day for a christening.

00:24.399 --> 00:26.401
I don't know. Something's not quite right.

00:26.485 --> 00:27.486
What do you mean?

00:27.569 --> 00:31.323
Maybe it's all this John Brown business.
I don't know.

00:32.198 --> 00:33.742
I had a bad dream last night.

00:34.326 --> 00:36.328
I thought we had fun last night.

00:36.411 --> 00:38.664
I'm glad we worked things out, baby.

00:38.747 --> 00:39.957
Me too.

00:40.415 --> 00:42.876
So now you can say goodbye
to your whole family,

00:42.960 --> 00:44.962
because we're moving to New Orleans.

00:45.796 --> 00:48.423
-Wait. What?
-We can talk about this later.

00:49.424 --> 00:51.426
It's kind of you to help Jane out today.

00:52.928 --> 00:56.765
She asked me to be the baby's godfather.
And as she's a widow, it's my duty.

00:57.850 --> 00:58.851
Of course.

00:59.518 --> 01:00.727
Where is Emily?

01:01.395 --> 01:05.022
At home, I imagine.
She doesn't usually come to church.

01:06.233 --> 01:10.696
You know, I still haven't seen her
since her poem was published.

01:11.321 --> 01:12.948
It's like she's hiding from me.

01:13.031 --> 01:14.491
Yes, well...

01:15.367 --> 01:17.703
I'd leave her alone if I were you.

01:18.370 --> 01:19.371
But...

01:20.873 --> 01:22.791
I have things I need to say to her.

01:23.458 --> 01:25.460
I imagine she knows them already.

01:28.005 --> 01:29.131
There's Jane.

01:29.923 --> 01:31.425
-Time to do this thing.
-Hi.

01:31.508 --> 01:34.720
Don't let people forget.
You're still my husband.

01:36.430 --> 01:38.682
No one here
is under any illusions about that.

01:41.059 --> 01:42.060
Hi.

01:44.771 --> 01:46.648
Isn't he a sweetie?

02:02.456 --> 02:05.375
Whoa. Slow down.

02:42.788 --> 02:44.248
Hey, Maggie. What's new?

02:45.165 --> 02:46.375
You know.

02:47.334 --> 02:48.919
Just a quiet Sunday.

02:49.002 --> 02:50.462
Enjoying me day of rest.

02:50.546 --> 02:53.715
I never rest on Sundays.
Still news on Sundays, you know.

02:53.799 --> 02:55.425
News every day of the week.

02:56.218 --> 02:57.511
Man, I am starving.

02:57.594 --> 02:59.304
Do you have anything I can snack on?

02:59.763 --> 03:01.557
There might be some plums in the kitchen.

03:01.640 --> 03:02.933
Do you have any roast beef?

03:03.433 --> 03:04.643
I'll go check.

03:04.726 --> 03:06.353
Would you like to take your coat off?

03:06.436 --> 03:07.437
No, I'm not staying long.

03:07.521 --> 03:09.690
I just wanted to grab a quick bite
before I hit the road.

03:09.773 --> 03:12.317
I was just hoping to say a quick goodbye
to the Dickinsons.

03:12.401 --> 03:13.777
Well, most of them aren't here.

03:13.861 --> 03:15.904
They're all at the church
for the christening.

03:16.405 --> 03:17.406
There's one.

03:19.449 --> 03:21.285
Mr. Bowles, I need to talk to you.

03:23.036 --> 03:24.997
You're acting strange. Is everything okay?

03:25.080 --> 03:27.207
Mr. Bowles,
would you follow me into the parlor?

03:32.963 --> 03:34.590
I'll go scrounge up some grub.

03:48.729 --> 03:49.771
What's going on?

03:49.855 --> 03:51.773
There's something I need to ask you.

03:51.857 --> 03:52.858
Okay.

03:53.358 --> 03:54.985
So, why are you talking to the wall?

03:56.695 --> 03:58.530
Because I'm protecting my eyes.

03:59.031 --> 04:00.282
My eyes are very sensitive,

04:00.365 --> 04:02.492
and I'm afraid that if I look at you,
I might go blind.

04:02.576 --> 04:03.702
Weird.

04:03.785 --> 04:07.039
Mr. Bowles,
do you still have my books of poems?

04:08.207 --> 04:09.208
The ones I gave you?

04:09.958 --> 04:12.252
Yeah, of course I do.
I got them right in my satchel.

04:12.336 --> 04:14.922
Planning to read through all of them again
on the train.

04:15.005 --> 04:17.466
I mean, your poems are first-class.
You know that.

04:17.548 --> 04:18.759
They really pop.

04:20.010 --> 04:22.763
I fear that I shall have to request
that you give them all back.

04:22.846 --> 04:23.972
What did you say?

04:25.390 --> 04:27.226
I said, politely...

04:28.560 --> 04:30.437
that you must give me my poems back.

04:31.230 --> 04:32.689
-Give them back?
-Yes.

04:33.190 --> 04:34.191
Immediately.

04:34.274 --> 04:35.275
Okay, I get it.

04:35.359 --> 04:38.070
I've been your editor long enough by now.

04:38.153 --> 04:40.656
This is another one of your games,

04:40.739 --> 04:42.741
where you pretend
like you don't wanna be published.

04:42.824 --> 04:44.535
It's virtue signaling. False modesty.

04:44.618 --> 04:45.827
It's cute, but...

04:46.662 --> 04:48.497
you really don't have to do this anymore.

04:49.164 --> 04:50.791
I am not playing a game.

04:51.375 --> 04:52.626
Okay.

04:52.709 --> 04:56.296
Mr. Bowles, I have decided
with much agonizing and struggle

04:56.380 --> 04:58.924
that I do not, in fact,
wish to be published.

04:59.007 --> 05:00.425
Therefore, I request that--

05:00.509 --> 05:04.930
No. No, I demand
that you give me back my poems.

05:05.305 --> 05:06.348
Emily.

05:06.431 --> 05:08.892
Your poem was a hit.

05:08.976 --> 05:11.019
You're about to become
world-famous overnight.

05:11.103 --> 05:14.523
People love the one we published,
and they're already begging for more.

05:14.606 --> 05:15.607
That's a lie.

05:16.525 --> 05:19.987
-Some people didn't love it. I heard them.
-No, it's not. It's better than that.

05:20.070 --> 05:21.280
It got under their skin.

05:21.655 --> 05:24.491
It made them think.
It made them ask questions.

05:25.200 --> 05:27.411
It was provocative. It got reactions.

05:27.911 --> 05:29.913
Which is all you can ever hope for
as a writer.

05:30.455 --> 05:31.748
Emily, I'm telling you.

05:31.832 --> 05:35.836
You're on your way to becoming the biggest
poet in New England, possibly America.

05:36.295 --> 05:38.714
And I'm just trying to help you
stop getting in your own way.

05:38.797 --> 05:42.426
The only thing
getting in my way right now is you.

05:42.509 --> 05:44.094
Ouch, that hurts.

05:44.178 --> 05:45.721
Give me back my poems.

05:45.804 --> 05:48.432
My newspaper empire, it is expanding.

05:49.141 --> 05:52.561
And you can be a part of that.
Don't you wanna help build an empire?

05:52.644 --> 05:53.854
I had an empire!

05:55.856 --> 05:57.065
It was right up here.

05:58.567 --> 06:00.444
And then you stole it from me.

06:01.987 --> 06:03.155
You...

06:04.323 --> 06:05.449
and Sue.

06:12.748 --> 06:13.957
So this is about Sue.

06:17.002 --> 06:18.587
I don't know what you mean by that.

06:21.548 --> 06:23.175
You know about us, don't you?

06:23.258 --> 06:24.551
I see what's going on here.

06:24.635 --> 06:27.304
You found out about me and Sue,
and now you're jealous.

06:27.721 --> 06:30.349
You thought I was flirting with you
or something.

06:31.099 --> 06:32.309
Leading you on.

06:33.519 --> 06:35.354
Well, I wasn't, okay?

06:36.605 --> 06:38.607
I was only ever interested in your work,

06:38.690 --> 06:40.901
which is what you
should be focused on too.

06:41.568 --> 06:44.363
Don't let your emotions
get in the way of your career.

06:44.446 --> 06:46.323
That is always what happens to women.

06:48.116 --> 06:49.326
I need my poems.

06:49.743 --> 06:51.411
No, Emily. You need me.

06:52.120 --> 06:54.998
See, a lot of people
wouldn't have even bothered with you.

06:55.457 --> 06:58.126
But I have, because I understand you.

06:58.210 --> 07:01.839
You're weird, and you're warped,
and you're sick, and you're strange,

07:02.214 --> 07:06.051
but I understand that, as a woman,
your art comes from all of that.

07:06.134 --> 07:08.846
Now, it would sadly be easy
for the whole world to ignore you,

07:08.929 --> 07:10.097
but I won't let them.

07:10.848 --> 07:12.891
No one would pay attention to you

07:12.975 --> 07:15.477
if it wasn't for me
pointing them in your direction.

07:15.561 --> 07:16.728
Trust me.

07:17.688 --> 07:19.773
You have no power without me.

07:20.732 --> 07:25.070
One day, you will look back
at all of this, and you will thank me.

07:27.990 --> 07:29.616
I'm gonna ask you one more time...

07:31.660 --> 07:33.370
give me back my poems.

07:35.664 --> 07:36.707
No.

07:37.499 --> 07:39.001
How dare you.

07:39.084 --> 07:41.295
You gave them to me, and now they're mine.

07:41.879 --> 07:43.422
You can't have them back.

07:43.505 --> 07:44.506
Fine.

07:44.965 --> 07:47.050
If you won't give them back,
I'll have to take them back.

07:47.134 --> 07:48.969
No, you know what? It's too late.

07:49.052 --> 07:50.053
What?

07:50.137 --> 07:51.972
I already sent one in to the office.

07:52.848 --> 07:54.683
Later today, it will be in print.

07:56.643 --> 07:57.644
Sorry.

08:02.274 --> 08:04.026
-Don't touch my satchel!
-I'm taking them back!

08:04.109 --> 08:05.694
-They're mine!
-They're not yours.

08:06.445 --> 08:07.446
I got 'em.

08:07.529 --> 08:08.780
-Give them back.
-Do you want 'em?

08:08.864 --> 08:10.240
-Give them back!
-Come and get them.

08:10.324 --> 08:11.700
Give them back!

08:12.784 --> 08:13.994
Hey!

08:15.287 --> 08:16.663
Go! Go!

08:16.747 --> 08:18.290
-Give me back my poems.
-No.

08:18.373 --> 08:19.374
Yes!

08:21.376 --> 08:22.628
Give them back to me!

08:24.546 --> 08:26.006
You are the devil!

08:26.089 --> 08:27.758
I am a feminist!

08:31.803 --> 08:33.347
And today, we are here to celebrate

08:33.429 --> 08:36.183
the birth of young William Wilkinson II

08:36.265 --> 08:37.643
-and to bless him...
-She looks amazing.

08:37.726 --> 08:39.394
...on his lifelong journey
on a path of faith.

08:39.477 --> 08:41.020
Stop!

08:41.104 --> 08:43.273
His mother, Jane, is here with us today,

08:43.357 --> 08:45.943
along with his godfather,
Austin Dickinson,

08:46.026 --> 08:49.988
who will be standing in for
the dearly departed William Wilkinson I.

08:51.281 --> 08:53.200
Wouldn't it be nice to have a grandchild?

08:53.575 --> 08:56.036
Although death
has separated us physically,

08:56.119 --> 08:58.956
faith and love have bound us eternally.

08:59.498 --> 09:02.751
Though we cannot see you,
William Wilkinson I, we know you are here.

09:07.089 --> 09:08.298
Look what I got.

09:09.049 --> 09:10.634
Nabbed 'em from his little briefcase

09:10.717 --> 09:12.928
while the two of you
was down there a-squabbling.

09:13.512 --> 09:14.513
Maggie.

09:14.596 --> 09:16.473
Thank you. How did you pull this off?

09:17.641 --> 09:20.269
A good maid knows how to be invisible.

09:20.936 --> 09:22.271
Thank you. Thank you.

09:23.814 --> 09:24.857
One fell out.

09:30.279 --> 09:32.322
Lord, sanctify this water,

09:32.406 --> 09:36.410
and grant that this child
may receive the fullness of thy grace.

09:39.454 --> 09:43.458
Austin Dickinson, by consenting
to be godfather of this child,

09:43.542 --> 09:46.253
you are acknowledging
your love of his mother, Jane,

09:46.336 --> 09:48.714
as well as your love of the child himself.

09:48.797 --> 09:50.048
You are making a commitment

09:50.132 --> 09:53.135
that this child shall never
go unloved in this world.

09:56.054 --> 09:58.682
Do you accept your role
as godfather of this child?

10:02.352 --> 10:03.979
-I do.
-Then let us pray.

10:04.897 --> 10:07.691
Lord, bless this child, and keep him safe.

10:08.192 --> 10:09.193
Amen.

10:09.276 --> 10:10.652
-Amen.
-Amen.

10:13.530 --> 10:14.656
Do you smell smoke?

10:27.461 --> 10:28.462
Emily.

10:29.630 --> 10:31.173
So, you know who I am.

10:31.256 --> 10:32.257
Yes.

10:33.717 --> 10:35.636
Yes, you're Frazar. Frazar Stearns.

10:35.719 --> 10:38.096
You know who I am,
and you know how I'm gonna die.

10:38.180 --> 10:39.181
Yes.

10:40.807 --> 10:42.017
-In the war.
-In the war.

10:45.187 --> 10:47.606
Seeking glory. Seeking fame.

10:51.068 --> 10:52.277
I'll leave my home...

10:55.030 --> 10:56.240
and my family...

10:57.491 --> 10:58.492
and go into battle.

10:59.952 --> 11:00.953
Yes.

11:02.412 --> 11:04.164
And then the bullet will hit you...

11:05.958 --> 11:07.000
like a bird.

11:08.460 --> 11:10.337
And so Frazar Stearns will die...

11:12.756 --> 11:14.174
to be remembered.

11:18.720 --> 11:20.556
Might have been better to be Nobody.

11:21.098 --> 11:22.099
I understand.

11:22.975 --> 11:24.852
And I will not make the same mistake.

11:27.020 --> 11:29.022
You have wars to fight, Emily Dickinson.

11:33.026 --> 11:35.028
But you must fight them in secret.

11:38.282 --> 11:39.491
Alone.

11:40.409 --> 11:41.618
Unseen.

11:42.369 --> 11:46.123
You must give all the glory to yourself
and ask for nothing from the world.

11:51.253 --> 11:52.880
You must be a nobody.

11:56.049 --> 11:58.886
The bravest, most brilliant
nobody who ever existed.

12:15.819 --> 12:17.487
You cannot put a Fire out -

12:19.781 --> 12:21.867
A Thing that can ignite

12:23.160 --> 12:25.204
Lavinia. Come, sweetie.

12:25.954 --> 12:28.290
Can go itself without a Fan -

12:32.169 --> 12:33.170
Abby!

12:33.253 --> 12:34.505
Upon the slowest night -

12:34.588 --> 12:35.672
Excuse me--

12:38.884 --> 12:40.594
You got it. You got it.

13:03.700 --> 13:04.701
Go away.

13:07.538 --> 13:08.539
Emily.

13:10.624 --> 13:11.625
I came to see you.

13:13.961 --> 13:15.003
Get out.

13:17.172 --> 13:18.173
Emily.

13:20.634 --> 13:21.635
We have to talk.

13:21.718 --> 13:23.971
I don't wanna talk to you.
I don't even wanna look at you.

13:24.054 --> 13:26.807
Come to think of it,
I don't ever wanna see you again.

13:29.393 --> 13:31.395
Give me a chance
to explain my side of things.

13:31.478 --> 13:33.146
What is there to explain?

13:33.230 --> 13:35.023
I can see everything perfectly clearly.

13:35.107 --> 13:37.734
No. There are things that you can't see.

13:39.236 --> 13:41.488
You have every right to be angry with me.

13:41.572 --> 13:43.490
I'm not asking you for your permission.

13:43.574 --> 13:46.243
I know you cared about him.

13:50.581 --> 13:51.582
Cared about him?

13:53.458 --> 13:56.003
You pushed me to care about him.

13:57.379 --> 13:59.006
You practically forced me to!

14:00.132 --> 14:03.260
It's like you wanted me
to fall in love with him. But why?

14:03.343 --> 14:05.596
When you were the one
that loved him the whole time.

14:05.679 --> 14:06.889
I didn't love him.

14:07.639 --> 14:09.266
-I never did.
-You're a liar.

14:10.058 --> 14:13.687
-I don't give a shit about that man.
-Then why did you sleep with him?

14:15.397 --> 14:16.565
And why...

14:17.691 --> 14:19.818
why did you keep telling me
to give him my poems?

14:19.902 --> 14:22.571
Because I couldn't handle
the things your poems made me feel.

14:23.614 --> 14:26.909
Your poems are too powerful.
They're like snakes.

14:26.992 --> 14:30.537
They slither into me,
and they coil around my heart,

14:30.621 --> 14:33.373
and they squeeze me until I can't breathe.

14:33.457 --> 14:36.668
They are glittering and venomous,
and they bite.

14:38.128 --> 14:39.838
I got scared, Emily.

14:39.922 --> 14:43.342
Of you, of the way that you grip me,
of the way that you poison me.

14:46.637 --> 14:48.847
When I married Austin
and we became sisters,

14:48.931 --> 14:51.099
the only bond between us was your words.

14:51.183 --> 14:57.898
You started writing so much, and I was
the only one who ever saw any of it.

14:59.399 --> 15:00.609
I got overwhelmed.

15:03.028 --> 15:06.365
So I thought if I pushed you
a little, then...

15:08.867 --> 15:11.578
If you pushed me away,
I'd become someone else's problem?

15:16.124 --> 15:17.960
Well, guess what?

15:20.838 --> 15:22.589
I'm not your problem anymore, Sue.

15:23.799 --> 15:27.010
You can go back to your perfect parlor
with your fancy dresses,

15:27.094 --> 15:29.596
and be as exquisitely empty as you like,

15:29.680 --> 15:32.266
because I will never
make you feel anything again.

15:32.349 --> 15:33.851
And without me...

15:35.477 --> 15:36.478
What?

15:37.604 --> 15:38.772
Without me...

15:40.440 --> 15:42.818
I don't think you know
how to have feelings.

15:44.945 --> 15:45.946
Okay.

15:48.156 --> 15:49.658
Shut the door on your way out.

15:53.579 --> 15:54.580
You're right.

15:57.249 --> 15:58.584
Right about what?

16:02.462 --> 16:05.465
The only time I feel things
is when I'm with you.

16:12.598 --> 16:16.185
"She dealt her pretty words like Blades
How glittering they shone"

16:17.352 --> 16:21.440
I pushed you towards him because
I wanted to escape what I was feeling.

16:22.816 --> 16:25.652
And I slept with him
'cause I didn't wanna feel it.

16:26.403 --> 16:31.241
There is so much
that I don't want to feel, Emily.

16:33.744 --> 16:35.621
And the biggest thing
that I don't want to feel--

16:35.704 --> 16:36.914
Is what?

16:39.208 --> 16:40.209
Is what?

16:41.251 --> 16:42.586
What is it, Sue? Just say it!

16:42.669 --> 16:44.338
Is that I'm in love with you.

16:44.421 --> 16:45.797
I don't believe you.

16:45.881 --> 16:47.007
It's true.

16:47.090 --> 16:48.300
It's not true.

16:49.510 --> 16:51.803
Nothing you say to me is true!

16:52.596 --> 16:54.431
You're not even Sue anymore.

16:54.515 --> 16:56.892
You're a new person, a fake person.

16:56.975 --> 17:00.103
I don't even recognize you,
and everything you say to me is a lie!

17:00.187 --> 17:01.396
Emily, I love you.

17:01.480 --> 17:02.773
Stop lying to me!

17:02.856 --> 17:03.690
I love you!

17:04.398 --> 17:08.612
And I felt you in the library,
because you're always with me.

17:08.694 --> 17:10.405
I can't escape from you,

17:10.489 --> 17:15.035
because the only true thing
I will ever feel is my love for you.

17:42.980 --> 17:44.690
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

17:48.902 --> 17:51.280
Girls. Are you okay?

17:55.576 --> 17:57.744
You weren't responsible for this,
were you?

18:01.623 --> 18:02.958
Yikes.

18:04.626 --> 18:05.627
Well...

18:07.171 --> 18:08.797
nobody needs to know about this.

18:09.506 --> 18:12.509
It's the 1850s.
Things burn down all the time.

18:13.802 --> 18:15.804
Okay, let's go home.

18:23.687 --> 18:25.439
Grab a seat wherever you can.

18:26.064 --> 18:29.193
Hats, coats, and jackets
can go in the library.

18:30.152 --> 18:33.488
There's hot tea brewing.
We have plenty of food for everyone.

18:33.572 --> 18:37.284
And I have a box set up over there
for donations.

18:37.367 --> 18:40.704
If anyone can give anything,
it would be much appreciated.

18:41.288 --> 18:44.124
That old church? It served us well.

18:45.209 --> 18:46.919
Blessed be its memory.

18:47.002 --> 18:50.088
It will take time, but we can rebuild.

18:50.839 --> 18:53.634
Amherst will come together,
as we always have,

18:54.259 --> 18:56.887
and we will overcome
this great misfortune.

18:58.639 --> 18:59.890
Well said.

18:59.973 --> 19:01.391
I'm proud of our son.

19:01.975 --> 19:04.019
Where is his wife?

19:04.102 --> 19:07.314
Don't you think she ought to be
by his side at a time like this?

19:08.732 --> 19:10.609
Austin, where is Sue?

19:10.692 --> 19:13.237
I do hope we didn't leave her
burning in the church.

19:13.320 --> 19:16.865
She's off living her life, I imagine,
just as I'm living mine.

19:24.873 --> 19:29.670
So, what is this insanity you're spouting
about us moving to New Orleans?

19:29.753 --> 19:30.879
Nola, babe. Nola.

19:30.963 --> 19:33.215
I don't care what you call it,
I'm not moving there.

19:33.298 --> 19:34.883
Yes, you are.

19:35.300 --> 19:39.263
I sent a telegram to a dude I know
down there in real estate, Joseph Lyman.

19:39.763 --> 19:41.223
Joseph Lyman, my ex?

19:41.306 --> 19:44.101
That's right.
I forgot you know that dude. Lyman.

19:44.184 --> 19:45.269
Lyman!

19:45.352 --> 19:47.521
Great guy. Wired him all my money.

19:47.604 --> 19:48.689
He got us a house.

19:48.772 --> 19:50.816
Joseph Lyman sold us a house?

19:50.899 --> 19:52.234
Well, it's more of a shack.

19:52.317 --> 19:54.653
You spent all of your money
on a shack in New Orleans

19:54.736 --> 19:57.739
and now you expect me to just
drop everything and come with you?

19:57.823 --> 19:58.866
Well, yeah.

19:58.949 --> 20:00.701
It's the 19th century. You're my wife.

20:00.784 --> 20:02.035
I make the decisions.

20:02.119 --> 20:05.122
Okay, have you been listening
to anything that I've been saying to you

20:05.205 --> 20:06.206
this whole time?

20:06.290 --> 20:08.208
Babe, Nola is so chill.
You're gonna love it.

20:08.292 --> 20:11.420
There is a civil war starting.
I am not moving to Louisiana.

20:11.503 --> 20:13.130
I'd never see my family again.

20:13.630 --> 20:15.632
Not to mention,
I'd be on the wrong side of history.

20:15.716 --> 20:17.050
Hey, the South's not all bad.

20:17.134 --> 20:19.469
The plantation system,
it's more like an aristocracy--

20:19.553 --> 20:21.346
Slavery is bad, Ship.

20:21.430 --> 20:23.515
I thought you were all about
keeping an open mind.

20:23.599 --> 20:24.683
Not in this case.

20:24.766 --> 20:26.560
Come on. It'll be charming.

20:26.643 --> 20:28.020
You'll be a Southern belle...

20:28.103 --> 20:29.938
I am a shrewd Yankee witch.

20:30.314 --> 20:31.940
-Respect that.
-I don't get it.

20:32.024 --> 20:33.317
You want me to leave you here

20:33.400 --> 20:35.569
and move down to Nola
and marry some cotton king's daughter?

20:35.652 --> 20:38.197
No, you-- you can marry me,

20:38.280 --> 20:42.117
we just have to stay in Amherst
and keep things loose and nonexclusive.

20:42.201 --> 20:43.202
Oh, my--

20:43.785 --> 20:44.912
Forget it.

20:45.454 --> 20:46.455
Forget it, man!

20:46.538 --> 20:49.541
I'm already in way over my head
on this shack.

20:51.210 --> 20:53.253
What-- Ship--

20:55.464 --> 20:56.924
Am I making a mistake?

20:57.007 --> 20:58.008
Yes.

20:58.091 --> 20:59.343
Absolutely.

20:59.426 --> 21:01.178
He wanted to marry you, Lavinia.

21:01.261 --> 21:03.722
Now you're gonna end up
a full-blown spinster.

21:09.061 --> 21:10.395
Same sheep, different day.

21:15.400 --> 21:16.693
Ship.

21:16.777 --> 21:18.153
Okay.

21:18.237 --> 21:20.239
-You go to New Orleans.
-Nola.

21:22.908 --> 21:24.117
Marry someone else.

21:24.826 --> 21:26.495
Have kids, all that shit.

21:27.496 --> 21:29.831
But you know, and I know...

21:30.499 --> 21:31.500
Yeah?

21:31.583 --> 21:35.212
...that I will always be the most
interesting girl you've ever loved.

21:40.175 --> 21:41.677
Our church.

21:41.760 --> 21:43.470
Our poor, beautiful church.

21:43.554 --> 21:44.555
Mrs. Dickinson.

21:46.473 --> 21:47.933
I dreamed this last night.

21:50.143 --> 21:51.144
What?

21:51.770 --> 21:53.981
-What are you talking about?
-I saw this happen.

21:56.275 --> 21:58.360
The church burning down. I had a vision.

21:59.069 --> 22:00.070
It came to me.

22:00.737 --> 22:02.573
I've seen all this before.

22:03.323 --> 22:05.158
No, you're imagining things.

22:05.242 --> 22:07.828
No. I dreamed about it last night,
and now it's real.

22:07.911 --> 22:09.830
Must be some terrible sign, a bad omen.

22:13.333 --> 22:15.836
All this talk of signs and visions.

22:16.336 --> 22:18.005
You sound as crazy as Emily.

22:20.257 --> 22:22.467
Or maybe she's not as crazy as we thought.

22:58.378 --> 22:59.588
Oh, my God.

23:54.101 --> 23:56.270
A narrow Fellow in the Grass

23:56.645 --> 23:58.063
Occasionally rides -

23:58.772 --> 24:01.483
You may have met him? Did you not

24:01.567 --> 24:03.068
His notice instant is

24:04.278 --> 24:05.988
The Grass divides as with a Comb,

24:07.155 --> 24:08.657
A spotted shaft is seen,

24:10.951 --> 24:12.953
And then it closes at your Feet

24:13.537 --> 24:14.955
And opens further on -

24:16.164 --> 24:17.708
He likes a Boggy Acre

24:18.375 --> 24:20.460
A Floor too cool for Corn -

24:21.253 --> 24:23.130
But when a Boy and Barefoot

24:23.213 --> 24:24.590
I more than once at Noon

24:25.382 --> 24:27.634
Have passed I thought a Whip Lash

24:28.302 --> 24:30.220
Unbraiding in the Sun

24:30.304 --> 24:32.055
When stooping to secure it

24:32.681 --> 24:34.474
It wrinkled and was gone -

24:40.689 --> 24:42.316
Several of nature's People

24:42.399 --> 24:44.443
I know, and they know me

24:45.277 --> 24:47.779
I feel for them a transport

24:47.863 --> 24:49.114
Of Cordiality

24:52.492 --> 24:53.911
But never met this Fellow

24:55.329 --> 24:57.164
Attended or alone

24:59.666 --> 25:01.084
Without a tighter Breathing

25:02.211 --> 25:03.837
And Zero at the Bone

25:12.596 --> 25:14.431
I could die happy right now.

25:17.100 --> 25:18.101
Not me.

25:19.228 --> 25:21.063
I feel sorry for the dead today.

25:23.440 --> 25:24.441
Emily?

25:25.817 --> 25:26.818
Yeah?

25:28.820 --> 25:30.030
When I'm with you...

25:31.990 --> 25:34.284
that is the only time I feel alive.

25:43.836 --> 25:45.045
That's all I need.

25:46.380 --> 25:48.048
That's all I've ever needed.

25:49.842 --> 25:51.468
To make you feel that way.

25:53.428 --> 25:55.848
I write for you, my Sue.

25:56.807 --> 25:58.016
I write for you.

26:00.602 --> 26:01.812
For you alone.

26:04.356 --> 26:05.649
That's enough.

26:10.445 --> 26:12.447
I will never let go of you again.
