11:22.498 --> 11:24.607
Most importantly, please
do not steal anything--

11:24.684 --> 11:25.441
Oh, no, no, no, no.

11:25.518 --> 11:26.959
Please don't do that, damian.

11:27.037 --> 11:28.261
I'm so sorry.

11:28.296 --> 11:30.187
Our last nanny stole some
jewels and a fur coat

11:30.189 --> 11:33.190
Right before the accident,
so, he's a little cautious.

11:33.192 --> 11:35.251

the clock is ticking.

11:35.286 --> 11:35.902

11:35.937 --> 11:37.070
I have to go and get ready,

11:37.105 --> 11:38.696
But damian is gonna
show you around.

11:38.698 --> 11:40.698
If you will please make sure

I, I just, rhodes, I just
want you to understand

24:11.133 --> 24:12.408
That I got this under control.

24:12.443 --> 24:13.993
I don't wanna make
this a thing, okay?

24:14.028 --> 24:16.804
[rhodes] [sighs] dee,
it's already a thing.

24:16.880 --> 24:19.848
I'm doing you a favor
and I'm gonna walk away.

24:19.883 --> 24:22.459
But you gotta understand,
if this keeps happening,

24:22.461 --> 24:23.793
I'm gonna have to do my job.

24:23.795 --> 24:25.795
I understand, rhodes. I
just, I want you to trust me.

24:25.797 --> 24:28.174
Understand that
I got this, okay?

24:28.209 --> 24:29.783
Okay.

24:29.860 --> 24:30.809
[scary banging]

24:30.886 --> 24:32.444
Sorry. I was just--

24:32.479 --> 24:35.372
Eavesdropping? Don't worry.
I won't tell anybody.

24:35.449 --> 24:37.057
You must be the new nanny.

24:37.059 --> 24:38.642
I'm the ex-husband, hudson.

24:38.644 --> 24:40.219
I'm gabby.

24:40.295 --> 24:41.270
Nice to meet you.

24:41.305 --> 24:43.313
[hudson] gabby, yeah.
Justice told me.

24:43.315 --> 24:44.356
I'm gonna trust you.

24:45.576 --> 24:46.775
You take care, man.

24:47.944 --> 24:49.487
[hudson] she said that
you were a writer.

24:50.239 --> 24:52.156
I happen to be a publisher.

24:52.158 --> 24:54.249
Yeah. Justice told me.

24:54.326 --> 24:55.801
You any good?

24:55.836 --> 24:56.535
I think so.

24:57.504 --> 24:59.571
Yes. Yes. I am good.

24:59.606 --> 25:00.822
That's what I like to hear.

25:00.899 --> 25:02.875
Confidence makes a good writer.

25:02.910 --> 25:04.084
I think I should know.

25:05.079 --> 25:06.411
Maybe you could give me
something you're writing

25:06.488 --> 25:07.688
And I could see what
I can do with it.

25:07.765 --> 25:10.490
You would do that? Why?

25:10.568 --> 25:11.884
You're taking care
of my daughter.

25:11.919 --> 25:13.719
Figured if she likes you
and you stick around,

25:13.754 --> 25:15.846
Then, I could return the favor.

25:18.059 --> 25:19.091
Thanks.

25:19.167 --> 25:20.350
Speaking of taking
care of my daughter,

25:20.352 --> 25:21.410
It's mother of the year.

25:21.445 --> 25:23.278
Hudson, what are you doing here?

25:23.280 --> 25:25.914
Well, when I hear the news
that my daughter was at a bar

25:25.949 --> 25:29.026
In the middle of the night
where my ex-wife was attacked,

25:29.028 --> 25:30.936
I thought I needed to check
and make sure she's okay.

25:31.013 --> 25:32.271
It wasn't like that.

25:32.347 --> 25:35.440
I wasn't attacked, and it
was a special occasion.

25:35.517 --> 25:36.742
[hudson] yeah, I
read about that.

25:36.777 --> 25:38.093
Congratulations on
your new marriage.

25:38.128 --> 25:40.763
I hope this one works
out for you, justice.

25:40.798 --> 25:43.298
Look, I didn't know he was
gonna propose like that.

25:43.333 --> 25:44.875
[hudson] yeah, you
could've fooled me.

25:46.878 --> 25:48.028
Well, now that I see
that everyone's okay,

25:48.138 --> 25:50.673
I will be back to pick up
willow for the weekend.

25:52.142 --> 25:53.366
Hudson--

25:53.444 --> 25:55.636
I don't want her at any more
of your hollywood parties.

25:59.015 --> 25:59.640
Hudson.

26:00.667 --> 26:01.559
Hudson.

26:05.498 --> 26:07.222
That was my ex-husband.

26:07.299 --> 26:08.566
Huge pain in my ass.

26:09.852 --> 26:12.444
I used to love that
son of a bitch,

26:12.479 --> 26:14.630
And I know he cares
a lot about us,

26:14.665 --> 26:16.282
Which is what drives me crazy.

26:16.317 --> 26:17.324
Mm.

26:18.152 --> 26:19.535
But what about ian?

26:20.971 --> 26:25.749
Ian's, ian's hot, he's young.
He's good for my career.

26:27.144 --> 26:28.493
But you don't love him?

26:28.570 --> 26:31.905
Love, love. Let's just say
we have an understanding.

26:31.982 --> 26:35.818
Like me, hudson did not know I
was getting engaged on stage.

26:35.853 --> 26:38.261
Of course the fans wanna see
you two get married. Okay?

26:38.263 --> 26:40.021
- Well, yeah, the prob--
- the press eating this up.

26:40.056 --> 26:40.756
Blah, blah, blah, blah.

26:40.832 --> 26:42.265
You're all over the tabloids.

26:42.267 --> 26:43.659
Yeah, well so, we can do
something in private then, yeah?

26:43.694 --> 26:46.586
This is insane. We don't
even have the same fans.

26:46.664 --> 26:48.271
And why would we do
something in private

26:48.273 --> 26:50.482
If we're doing it for
the public anyway, right?

26:50.517 --> 26:53.936
New fans is exactly the
idea, for both of you.

26:53.971 --> 26:56.429
They'd like to see you guys
together, more for everyone.

26:56.507 --> 26:57.706
Okay. Just picture it.

26:57.783 --> 26:58.966
We'll start off
with the classics,

26:59.042 --> 27:00.117
And then we can
go to the new song

27:00.194 --> 27:01.118
You just made.
- Yeah, yeah, whatever.

27:01.195 --> 27:02.268
We'll figure it out.

27:02.346 --> 27:05.514
But please, both of
you, no more surprises.

27:05.549 --> 27:06.998
It's all part of the
plan, sweetheart.

27:07.000 --> 27:09.184
Come on, you gotta
trust me on this. Mm-ah.

27:09.219 --> 27:12.046
Whatever. Just, out.
Leave, all of you.

27:13.540 --> 27:14.506
Not you.

27:17.119 --> 27:17.860
[gabby sighs]

27:17.895 --> 27:19.261
I like your headband.

27:20.214 --> 27:20.888
Thanks.

27:22.299 --> 27:23.407
Do you need something?

27:23.484 --> 27:26.292
[sighs] well, I have
this interview tonight,

27:26.294 --> 27:29.129
So I was wondering if you
would make something to eat

27:29.206 --> 27:30.205
For willow.

27:30.240 --> 27:32.441
Vernon fired the chef,
so, we're adapting.

27:32.476 --> 27:33.550
Sure. I make a mean quesadilla.

27:33.627 --> 27:36.161
Oh, no, no. No cheese,
not in this house.

27:36.238 --> 27:37.446
Cheese, bad. Got it.

27:37.481 --> 27:38.814
If that's everything,
I'll just go unpack.

27:38.849 --> 27:40.499
Well actually, there's
one more thing.

27:40.501 --> 27:42.743
We're having this little
get together here tomorrow

27:42.820 --> 27:44.869
And willow is
staying at her dad's.

27:44.871 --> 27:46.329
Oh, so you don't need me then?

27:46.331 --> 27:48.832
Well, actually I was
hoping you wanted to come.

27:48.834 --> 27:49.875
Oh, thanks.

27:49.910 --> 27:52.318
Um, I was thinking I could
use that time to write though.

27:52.396 --> 27:53.912
With willow and hudson--

27:53.989 --> 27:56.231
Can I be honest with you?
It's kind of important.

27:56.266 --> 27:59.009
And with all the staff
being fired, I have no one.

27:59.753 --> 28:01.920
I could really use your help.

28:01.997 --> 28:06.166
Okay. Yeah. Um, it'll
be fun, I guess.

28:06.243 --> 28:08.184
Yeah, it'll be a nightmare.

28:08.186 --> 28:11.063
[soft somber music]

28:17.713 --> 28:18.821
All right.

28:20.607 --> 28:24.201
One quinoa salad with kale and
a drizzle of vegan dressing.

28:25.446 --> 28:28.021
Great. Just what I didn't want.

28:28.098 --> 28:31.065
Yeah. Didn't sound good
while I was saying it.

28:31.143 --> 28:34.753
You know what? I've got an idea.

28:38.950 --> 28:40.300
[tv audience cheers]

28:40.302 --> 28:41.801
Oh my god.

28:41.803 --> 28:43.111
I know, I know.

28:43.146 --> 28:44.346
I'm sorry. I'm supposed
to be promoting the movie.

28:44.381 --> 28:47.207
I'm just so excited
for my wedding.

28:47.284 --> 28:49.042
Look, we don't
have to watch this.

28:49.119 --> 28:50.936
No, no. This is some
of her best acting.

28:50.971 --> 28:52.712
[justice] and the tour
starting this summer--

28:52.790 --> 28:55.323
Actually, it's late.

28:55.400 --> 28:58.460
How 'bout you get ready for
bed before your mom gets back?

28:58.495 --> 28:59.445
Can you do that for me?

28:59.480 --> 29:00.612
[justice] yeah,
yeah, the fifth album

29:00.722 --> 29:02.163
Is coming out, so.
- Yeah.

29:02.240 --> 29:04.224
Hey, gabby?
- Hm?

29:04.301 --> 29:05.784
Thanks for this.

29:05.819 --> 29:07.168
[justice] a lot of
things happening.

29:07.245 --> 29:09.621
I never get to just
chill and be a kid.

29:11.174 --> 29:13.584
It's nice to have
someone actually see me.

29:15.296 --> 29:16.736
Good night.

29:16.814 --> 29:18.588
Night, willow.

29:18.590 --> 29:19.347
I'll see you up there.

29:19.424 --> 29:20.048
[willow] yeah.

29:33.347 --> 29:35.363
[ian] you're in trouble.

29:35.365 --> 29:38.500
Don't worry, love. It'll
be our little secret.

29:38.535 --> 29:40.694
Sure it's one of many to come.

29:41.872 --> 29:43.280
I didn't even know
you were here.

29:45.326 --> 29:46.325
I shouldn't.

29:47.461 --> 29:49.644
You're relieved of duty.

29:49.722 --> 29:51.413
Who's left to nanny,
other than me?

29:53.017 --> 29:55.083
Actually, I have
some writing to do.

29:56.879 --> 29:58.003
Anything I've read?

29:59.222 --> 29:59.838
Not yet.

30:01.391 --> 30:05.010
Wait, wait, wait, don't.
Come on, just one. Please?

30:05.638 --> 30:09.564
[soft mysterious music]

30:09.641 --> 30:10.640
Good night, nan.

30:10.642 --> 30:11.809
Good night.

30:13.812 --> 30:16.021
Alone again, naturally.

30:23.580 --> 30:25.230
All ready for bed?

30:25.307 --> 30:26.565
Almost.

30:26.641 --> 30:27.699
Get some sleep.

30:29.995 --> 30:34.623
Hey, gabby. Are you
gonna stay with us?

30:38.011 --> 30:40.095
Would you like that?

30:40.171 --> 30:45.342
Maybe. You knew my mom, right?
When she was still normal?

30:46.678 --> 30:49.762
I met her once when I was
younger than you are now.

30:49.764 --> 30:51.681
My mom knew her really well.

30:51.683 --> 30:52.908
You seem normal.

30:52.943 --> 30:55.060
Oh, uh, thank you?

30:56.796 --> 30:57.896
Mia did too.

31:00.117 --> 31:01.190
You miss her?

31:01.192 --> 31:03.235
Yeah, and she didn't
steal from us.

31:03.270 --> 31:05.779
She wouldn't do that.
She was a good nanny.

31:07.532 --> 31:08.790
Hmm.

31:08.867 --> 31:11.994
Just promise me you won't
leave like everyone else.

31:14.081 --> 31:15.080
I promise.

31:17.542 --> 31:19.300
Now get some sleep.

31:19.377 --> 31:20.043
Okay.

31:20.045 --> 31:21.086

this was a small dinner party.

01:07:01.851 --> 01:07:03.393
My concern was for willow.

01:07:03.428 --> 01:07:05.912
Well of course, because
that is your job.

01:07:05.947 --> 01:07:09.340
Until we catch the guy, I
suggest you all stay together.

01:07:09.417 --> 01:07:11.568
No changes in your
schedule. You got it?

01:07:11.603 --> 01:07:12.843
Well, that's gonna be tough

01:07:12.921 --> 01:07:14.695
Because we got a
big show coming up.

01:07:14.697 --> 01:07:16.422
Well, if I were you,

01:07:16.457 --> 01:07:20.518
I would advise her that
she has a choice to make.

01:07:20.595 --> 01:07:23.538
[soft somber music]

01:07:28.970 --> 01:07:33.798
Oh my goodness. We've gotta
stop meeting like this, nanny.

01:07:34.960 --> 01:07:36.051
Baby girl, we're going home.

01:07:36.961 --> 01:07:38.444
You're kidding me.

01:07:38.479 --> 01:07:40.113
You think you're safe in
that hollywood hell house?

01:07:40.148 --> 01:07:42.039
My daughter was almost
kidnapped, justice.

01:07:42.117 --> 01:07:44.058
That was the same
woman from the party.

01:07:44.060 --> 01:07:45.101
It was just an insane fan.

01:07:45.136 --> 01:07:47.169
And who was driving
the van, damian? Who?

01:07:47.247 --> 01:07:48.772
This is your fault.

01:07:48.807 --> 01:07:50.498
This is my fault?

01:07:50.575 --> 01:07:52.466
This is your entire
life, justice.

01:07:52.544 --> 01:07:56.245
You know, I used to think that
if I let this phase play out

01:07:56.322 --> 01:07:58.131
With ian, maybe
someday you and I

01:07:58.133 --> 01:08:00.091
Might be able to
have something again.

01:08:00.168 --> 01:08:04.245
But that isn't real,
because nothing is for you.

01:08:04.247 --> 01:08:06.289
You will be hearing
from my lawyers.

01:08:06.324 --> 01:08:07.290
Dad?

01:08:09.043 --> 01:08:10.502
Hey, I love you sweetie. Okay?

01:08:12.255 --> 01:08:13.630
And your mother's
right for once.

01:08:13.665 --> 01:08:16.590
There's more security
at her house. Okay?

01:08:16.592 --> 01:08:19.511
[soft somber music]

01:08:28.830 --> 01:08:31.197
I am so sorry. This
is all my fault.

01:08:31.274 --> 01:08:33.591
I, I shouldn't have let him
take her. I shouldn't have come.

01:08:33.668 --> 01:08:35.193
I should have called damian.

01:08:36.187 --> 01:08:38.655
You don't need to
fire me. I'll quit.

01:08:38.690 --> 01:08:39.705
What?

01:08:39.782 --> 01:08:40.781
But you promised.

01:08:40.783 --> 01:08:42.766
Willow, I'm so sorry.

01:08:42.844 --> 01:08:43.934
I thought I could do this,

01:08:44.012 --> 01:08:45.786
But with everything
that's happened,

01:08:45.788 --> 01:08:48.364
I couldn't bear to put
you in more danger.

01:08:48.441 --> 01:08:52.101

01:08:53.855 --> 01:08:54.587

01:09:37.932 --> 01:09:40.683

Let me in, let me in.

01:09:47.833 --> 01:09:48.766
He's a stalker.

Open the door.

Get out.

I followed him from hudson's.

01:10:17.863 --> 01:10:19.130

You're not stupid, hannah.

01:10:47.835 --> 01:10:51.120
[sniffles] he just
came to set one day

01:10:51.155 --> 01:10:54.231

01:11:21.610 --> 01:11:22.819
Who are you calling?

what happened last night.

Won't damian tell her?

01:11:30.829 --> 01:11:33.454
I don't know. He has
a lot of secrets.

from each other.

He's with willow. Can't risk
anything happening to her.

And I'm so sorry.

I was a mess, and...

the stories about her and ian

01:13:17.452 --> 01:13:19.209
Can't blame him for it.

01:13:39.081 --> 01:13:40.289
No, stop.

01:13:40.324 --> 01:13:44.193
Stop feeling sorry for yourself.

01:13:44.269 --> 01:13:46.445
You don't give
yourself enough credit.

01:13:46.523 --> 01:13:48.831
I feel like I'm holding
the weight of the world

01:13:48.908 --> 01:13:50.007
On my shoulders.

01:13:51.427 --> 01:13:55.471
And at any moment, cracks
will start to show.

01:13:57.642 --> 01:14:00.935
Did you know I haven't had a
real hit since willow was born?

01:14:02.104 --> 01:14:04.605
Hudson left me because
I was so selfish.

01:14:06.200 --> 01:14:07.567
It's not what you think it is.

01:14:10.454 --> 01:14:13.189
You finally get what
you always wanted,

01:14:13.265 --> 01:14:14.782
What you always dreamed about.

01:14:16.452 --> 01:14:17.618
And once you have it,

01:14:20.606 --> 01:14:21.831
You can hardly stand it.

01:14:23.184 --> 01:14:24.459
Some days I,

01:14:25.553 --> 01:14:27.503
I wanna run screaming
into the streets

01:14:27.538 --> 01:14:29.547
And make it all go away.

01:14:30.891 --> 01:14:35.636
But I can't, because too
many people depend on me.

I'm jay gray,

01:14:39.033 --> 01:14:40.057

Once that star starts to fade,

01:14:46.148 --> 01:14:49.742
You try everything in your
power to hold onto it.

01:14:49.818 --> 01:14:53.654
I did one, one stupid
interview on a couch with ian,

01:14:54.807 --> 01:14:57.366
And all of a sudden,
people cared again.

01:14:57.476 --> 01:15:01.162
And now everything is
wrapped up in this fake show,

01:15:03.074 --> 01:15:04.123
That I hate.

01:15:05.059 --> 01:15:06.333

01:15:06.335 --> 01:15:07.727
Everything.

01:15:07.762 --> 01:15:11.339
You can be standing in a
room with thousands of people

01:15:12.583 --> 01:15:17.094
And still feel like
you're all alone.

01:15:18.239 --> 01:15:22.165
You have willow. And
justice, you have me.

01:15:22.243 --> 01:15:24.393
You quit. Remember?

01:15:24.428 --> 01:15:26.562
Okay, so what if I come back?

01:15:26.597 --> 01:15:27.605

01:27:13.070 --> 01:27:14.394
All right?

01:27:14.396 --> 01:27:16.562
I'm not sure what I
would've done without her.

01:27:16.564 --> 01:27:17.289
We're friends?

01:27:17.324 --> 01:27:18.656
Of course.

01:27:18.733 --> 01:27:20.233
We're like the same
person, you and me.

01:27:20.235 --> 01:27:21.217
We just need to be loved.

01:27:21.295 --> 01:27:22.911
Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:27:22.987 --> 01:27:24.446
Besides you're one
hell of a star.

01:27:25.282 --> 01:27:26.615
[sighs] come here.

01:27:27.559 --> 01:27:31.078
[gentle melancholic music]

01:27:34.249 --> 01:27:38.477
By the way, uh, can I still
stay in the guest bedroom?

01:27:38.512 --> 01:27:39.836
[laughs] no.

01:27:42.299 --> 01:27:43.423
Hey.

01:27:43.425 --> 01:27:44.675
Thank you.

01:27:46.928 --> 01:27:47.669
[gabby] --this out to?

01:27:47.704 --> 01:27:48.595
Danny.

01:27:48.672 --> 01:27:51.523
Okay, here you go, gabs.
Do you need any more?

01:27:51.599 --> 01:27:52.507
I think we're good.

01:27:52.584 --> 01:27:55.060
Okay. This is so exciting.

01:27:57.631 --> 01:27:58.563
Hope you enjoy it.

01:28:00.809 --> 01:28:02.442
Hi. Who should I
make this out to?

01:28:02.444 --> 01:28:04.528
How about to my biggest fan?

01:28:05.239 --> 01:28:06.238
You came.

01:28:07.599 --> 01:28:08.373
Thank you.

01:28:08.450 --> 01:28:10.342
Oh, I did write the forward. No?

01:28:10.377 --> 01:28:13.345
Thank you, for letting
me tell your story.

01:28:13.380 --> 01:28:14.746
Look who's the star now.

01:28:16.049 --> 01:28:17.940
So, still looking for a nanny?

01:28:17.942 --> 01:28:21.295
No, not anymore. [chuckles]

01:28:21.371 --> 01:28:24.656
[gabby] oh my gosh.
You're all here.

01:28:24.658 --> 01:28:25.857
Gabby.

01:28:25.892 --> 01:28:27.676
Here I'll--one for
all three of you.
