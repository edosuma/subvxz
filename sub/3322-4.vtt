WEBVTT

00:01.160 --> 00:03.083
<i>(IF I HAD A HEART PLAYING)</i>

01:12.220 --> 01:14.851
We'll stay here.

01:14.960 --> 01:16.166
ASLAUG: No, stop.

01:18.840 --> 01:21.411
I'm not staying there.
It looks disgusting.

01:21.480 --> 01:24.484
Princess, it will be
winter soon enough.

01:24.840 --> 01:27.605
If we have nowhere to live,
no roof over our heads,

01:27.680 --> 01:30.809
no hearth fire to warm us,
we will all perish.

01:32.240 --> 01:34.163
Surely we can find
some Earl's hall,

01:34.320 --> 01:36.209
somewhere more
inviting and comfortable.

01:38.280 --> 01:39.930
For my children.

01:41.560 --> 01:43.881
And if we are to
find such a place,

01:43.960 --> 01:44.927
it would only take
a few days

01:45.040 --> 01:47.691
before someone took the
news to Jarl Borg.

01:52.600 --> 01:54.204
We will survive this.

01:54.280 --> 01:56.442
Believe me, you and
I can survive this.

01:56.520 --> 01:58.284
It will make
you stronger.

01:58.360 --> 02:00.044
It will make your
sons stronger, also.

02:21.720 --> 02:23.802
BORG: People of Kattegat,
welcome.

02:24.240 --> 02:25.969
Let me introduce myself.

02:26.080 --> 02:30.927
I am Jarl Borg of GÃ¶tland,
your new ruler.

02:33.000 --> 02:36.288
I promise you I only came
here to seek justice.

02:36.360 --> 02:39.091
Earl Ragnar broke his sacred
promise he made to me

02:39.160 --> 02:40.764
and therefore,
by our laws,

02:40.840 --> 02:43.002
he forfeited
the right to rule.

02:43.600 --> 02:45.807
You will find me a fair ruler.

02:46.040 --> 02:49.169
Kattegat is an important trading
station and I mean to see it flourish.

02:49.240 --> 02:53.245
If you all cooperate and work with
me, we shall have no problems.

02:54.440 --> 02:55.885
Of course,
I will want my wife,

02:55.960 --> 02:57.610
more of my own people
to join me here,

02:57.680 --> 03:01.321
but that should not disturb you.
We will all be one family.

03:10.720 --> 03:13.200
There will be no
protest against my rule.

03:14.960 --> 03:18.931
And there will be no
law here except mine.

03:21.800 --> 03:25.088
Whoever will deliver me the
whereabouts of Ragnar's wife,

03:25.160 --> 03:28.448
his children
and his brother,

03:28.560 --> 03:32.645
will be paid his or her own
weight in silver and gold.

03:34.920 --> 03:38.561
From now on, only criminals
will talk of Ragnar Lothbrok.

03:38.640 --> 03:42.486
To all intents and purposes,
Ragnar Lothbrok is dead.

03:57.400 --> 03:59.084
Why have you come?

04:02.560 --> 04:05.166
I've come to ask
you some questions.

04:05.240 --> 04:06.810
Not too many.

04:07.960 --> 04:10.361
I have no time to
answer too many.

04:12.720 --> 04:14.848
Then tell me this,
wise one.

04:17.160 --> 04:19.891
Did you foresee
what has happened here?

04:20.440 --> 04:22.727
And if so, did you
warn the people?

04:22.800 --> 04:25.371
I see what the gods
allow me to see,

04:25.840 --> 04:28.241
and say what they
allow me to say.

04:29.520 --> 04:31.284
Then you saw nothing?

04:32.760 --> 04:34.410
Or you said nothing?

04:38.880 --> 04:41.042
Do you have any
other questions?

04:51.280 --> 04:54.045
I'd like to know
what will happen to me.

04:54.480 --> 04:57.404
If, that is, the gods
will allow you to see.

05:00.200 --> 05:01.850
Yes, I can see.

05:03.920 --> 05:05.365
And I see an eagle.

05:07.040 --> 05:09.566
I see that an eagle
hovers over you.

05:10.560 --> 05:13.723
But I also see that you
yourself are the eagle.

05:14.240 --> 05:16.083
An eagle is a good sign.

05:17.520 --> 05:19.921
Always, in the sagas,
a good sign.

05:21.320 --> 05:24.608
An eagle, a soaring bird.

05:27.240 --> 05:29.447
A good sign from the gods.

05:30.920 --> 05:32.604
Is it not true, old man?

05:32.680 --> 05:35.365
Yes, I see an eagle,

05:37.240 --> 05:40.483
and the eagle is
your destiny, Jarl Borg.

06:09.120 --> 06:10.804
EDMUND: Sire, if we
continue to do nothing,

06:10.920 --> 06:12.649
their depredations
will only spread.

06:12.720 --> 06:16.327
They've not removed themselves nor
yet sailed away, as we all prayed.

06:16.400 --> 06:19.961
Your army is collected, Sire,
and awaits your orders.

06:22.000 --> 06:24.480
They expressed
the desire to talk,

06:26.640 --> 06:29.644
so, first, we should talk.

06:30.720 --> 06:32.643
How are we to
trust men like these

06:32.720 --> 06:36.441
who kill without conscience, who
desecrate and pollute sacred places?

06:36.520 --> 06:38.090
No, we cannot
trust them.

06:38.160 --> 06:41.482
Therefore, there will be an exchange
of hostages before we begin.

06:43.240 --> 06:47.131
And who are we to deliver
into their tender care?

06:48.000 --> 06:50.207
My son, Aethelwulf.

06:50.680 --> 06:51.681
Father?

06:51.760 --> 06:54.843
A hostage of the highest
value is the safest hostage.

06:55.680 --> 06:57.284
But I will not
deliver you to them

06:57.360 --> 06:59.408
until they have
first delivered to me

06:59.560 --> 07:01.608
a hostage of equal
value to themselves.

07:02.120 --> 07:05.522
They are savages, heathens. They
do not put a value on any life.

07:05.680 --> 07:06.681
ECBERT: Oh, I...

07:07.280 --> 07:09.009
I doubt that.

07:10.040 --> 07:14.045
We are Christians, but not so
long ago we were also pagans.

07:14.200 --> 07:16.441
And when we were pagans,

07:16.520 --> 07:19.364
do you think we cared
nothing for our families?

07:19.880 --> 07:21.245
Our children?

07:22.840 --> 07:25.127
But I swear
to you, my son,

07:25.200 --> 07:29.683
I would never surrender you without
your blessing and agreement.

07:31.400 --> 07:35.041
Father, you know
the answer to that.

07:35.880 --> 07:37.882
I place myself
in your hands.

07:38.360 --> 07:40.044
I am at your disposal.

07:40.200 --> 07:42.441
(INDISTINCT MURMURING)

(CLUCKING)

07:58.160 --> 08:00.891
(BABY CRYING)

08:02.360 --> 08:04.522
I said, get down! Boys!

08:04.600 --> 08:06.921
Move it. I don't want to sit!

08:07.000 --> 08:08.525
Stop it!
I'm not going to stop!

08:08.600 --> 08:09.601
Boys! Ubbe!

08:09.720 --> 08:10.767
Stop it!

08:10.840 --> 08:12.410
Leave your brother alone!

08:12.480 --> 08:14.005
Stop it!
Ubbe! Stop it!

08:14.080 --> 08:15.411
Come on, let's go.
Hvitserk!

08:15.480 --> 08:17.209
Here, give me the baby.

08:18.080 --> 08:19.081
Ubbe!

08:20.240 --> 08:21.446
Off him!

08:25.000 --> 08:27.128
Everything is
so dirty here.

08:31.280 --> 08:34.886
You are safe here, and your
children are safe here.

08:36.440 --> 08:37.520
Safe?

08:38.960 --> 08:41.440
They will all die
of some disease.

08:41.919 --> 08:45.129
Look at the boys, already
so thin, so sickly.

08:45.560 --> 08:48.450
I can't stay here.
You have to stay here.

08:48.520 --> 08:50.284
Look, I know this is not
what you are used to,

08:50.360 --> 08:52.249
but you will get used to it.
(CRIES)

08:53.880 --> 08:56.008
Many of our people
live like this.

08:56.080 --> 08:58.731
Life is not a walk
across an open field.

08:58.800 --> 09:00.802
Say what
you want, Siggy.

09:03.960 --> 09:05.644
We won't stay here.

11:12.280 --> 11:13.850
Who made all
of these things?

11:13.920 --> 11:15.445
Nobody knows.

11:15.800 --> 11:18.929
Some say a race of giants
once lived on this island.

11:20.400 --> 11:21.606
Giants?

11:27.520 --> 11:31.730
Sire, may I present
Earl Ragnar Lothbrok.

11:35.360 --> 11:37.010
You may leave us.

11:38.960 --> 11:40.291
All of you.

11:52.640 --> 11:55.803
Will you not join me,
Ragnar Lothbrok?

11:57.120 --> 11:58.531
The water is
very temperate.

13:03.880 --> 13:04.927
Now we are equal.

13:06.720 --> 13:10.805
We can talk together
honestly, man to man.

13:15.120 --> 13:17.726
May I ask you a question,
Ragnar Lothbrok?

13:20.960 --> 13:23.042
Why do you
not go home?

13:24.720 --> 13:26.802
After the sack of the
minster at Winchester,

13:26.880 --> 13:29.042
you surely have
enough treasure.

13:30.480 --> 13:32.084
And by staying,

13:33.600 --> 13:37.002
you've given me time
to raise a large army.

13:41.680 --> 13:43.842
I don't care
about treasure.

13:45.280 --> 13:48.409
I am a very
curious man.

13:50.600 --> 13:54.241
I want to see your lands, and I
want to see how you farm them.

13:55.520 --> 13:58.126
You see,
l am really a farmer.

14:04.000 --> 14:08.369
Are you saying that if I offer you
some land, we could make a deal?

14:11.960 --> 14:13.530
It's possible.

14:15.920 --> 14:18.571
But I would want
something in return.

14:18.960 --> 14:21.167
You see,
Ragnar Lothbrok,

14:22.600 --> 14:24.090
l am an ambitious man.

14:24.440 --> 14:26.408
I have great plans.

14:27.880 --> 14:31.885
And you and your warriors could
help me to fulfill them.

14:45.040 --> 14:47.168
HORIK: What else did this
King of Wessex have to say?

14:49.240 --> 14:51.242
LOTHBROK: That he
might offer us land.

14:52.000 --> 14:55.925
HORIK: And you believed him? Can
you trust him, this Christian?

14:58.160 --> 15:00.242
He wants something
in return.

15:00.960 --> 15:02.803
What does he
want in return?

15:13.320 --> 15:14.446
It's Thorvard.

15:20.160 --> 15:21.207
Thorvard!

15:25.160 --> 15:26.685
(LAUGHS)

15:30.600 --> 15:31.647
Thorvard.

15:32.840 --> 15:34.046
Welcome.

15:34.200 --> 15:35.964
Thank you,
My Lord.

15:36.080 --> 15:39.050
I bring grave news
for Ragnar Lothbrok.

15:45.000 --> 15:48.322
Your lands are lost,
invaded by Jarl Borg.

15:48.400 --> 15:51.449
Your family is fled,
only the gods know where.

15:51.880 --> 15:55.646
Now Jarl Borg lives in your great
hall and rules in your place.

16:02.480 --> 16:04.801
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

16:07.040 --> 16:08.087
You're leaving?

16:08.200 --> 16:09.326
Of course I am.

16:09.400 --> 16:11.323
I must find my family.

16:11.880 --> 16:13.530
Are you not coming?

16:13.640 --> 16:15.722
I'm minded to
stay here, Ragnar,

16:15.800 --> 16:18.326
to speak with this
King Ecbert further.

16:18.400 --> 16:22.121
I think he is afraid of us. I will
make some deal to our advantage.

16:24.000 --> 16:26.367
You can't even
speak their language.

16:26.920 --> 16:28.888
How will you
communicate?

16:29.000 --> 16:33.210
If you will permit this man,
Athelstan, to remain with me,

16:33.760 --> 16:35.205
he can do
the talking.

16:36.680 --> 16:38.682
Athelstan is
a free man.

16:39.280 --> 16:40.930
It is his choice.

16:41.440 --> 16:45.047
If I can be of help to King
Horik, then I am happy to stay.

16:46.240 --> 16:48.766
I am surprised to
hear you say that.

16:50.680 --> 16:53.490
For you know my family
better than anyone.

16:55.800 --> 16:57.928
You've always said how
important these contacts are

16:58.040 --> 17:00.566
for the future and prosperity
of all your people.

17:00.640 --> 17:03.211
So is it not more important
for me to remain here?

17:03.280 --> 17:05.487
Are you sure you
want to do this?

17:16.400 --> 17:17.640
Then so be it.

17:19.960 --> 17:21.644
Prepare the ships.

17:24.680 --> 17:28.844
If you change your mind, your friends
will be leaving at first light.

17:30.200 --> 17:33.682
May Thor fill your sails
to the place of vengeance.

18:20.000 --> 18:21.001

they've all fled Kattegat.

I cannot believe it.

18:38.760 --> 18:40.524
What are the
gods thinking?

18:40.680 --> 18:42.842
Ragnar will come back.

18:42.920 --> 18:45.571
He will come back to fight for
his lands, and we must help him.

18:48.040 --> 18:49.201
We can't.

18:51.120 --> 18:53.600
But you... It's not
Earl Sigvard's quarrel.

18:53.680 --> 18:55.967
Why should he fight
to restore Ragnar's lands?

18:57.040 --> 18:58.724
You could ask him.

How many?

19:35.440 --> 19:37.681
Twenty, thirty warriors.

That's not enough.

19:39.240 --> 19:41.607
No, not enough.

19:42.960 --> 19:44.610
At least to do battle.

19:46.520 --> 19:48.522
But perhaps
enough to torment.

19:49.240 --> 19:51.083
We have to make
sure that Jarl Borg

19:51.160 --> 19:53.367
never feels secure
in his inheritance.

19:54.920 --> 19:58.481
We can mount raids on his
outposts, disrupt his supplies.

Sooner or later,
my brother will return,

20:02.120 --> 20:06.125

is to keep his memory alive.

have spoken like this.

I thought impossible.

my heart,

for you.

21:34.720 --> 21:37.166
There's something I want
to talk to you about.

21:38.400 --> 21:42.200
As long as it has nothing
to do with Ragnar Lothbrok,

21:42.320 --> 21:43.845
then talk away.

21:45.400 --> 21:47.880
Of course it has
to do with Ragnar.

21:48.240 --> 21:50.208
Then I'm not
interested.

21:52.640 --> 21:54.165
Come into bed.

21:55.200 --> 21:56.201
No.

21:58.080 --> 21:59.161
Not until
we have talked.

21:59.240 --> 22:00.969
I told you, woman,

22:01.720 --> 22:04.564
I don't want to talk
about your ex-husband.

22:05.240 --> 22:09.529
He used to own your
body, but now I own it.

22:12.880 --> 22:14.086
So come to bed.

22:20.080 --> 22:23.607
It would be in your interest
to intervene in this affair.

22:23.680 --> 22:24.966
How so?

22:27.240 --> 22:29.971
Jarl Borg will
bring his relations,

22:30.080 --> 22:32.845
his family, his
people from GÃ¶tland,

22:32.920 --> 22:35.651
and place them
on your doorstep.

22:35.720 --> 22:38.200
On our doorstep, wife.

22:40.360 --> 22:43.443
After Ragnar,
you will be next.

22:44.120 --> 22:45.281
Don't you understand?

22:45.800 --> 22:47.529
Forget Ragnar.
Don't!

to bring us back together

am glad for it.

44:50.400 --> 44:51.401
Ha!

44:53.560 --> 44:55.881
I do not need to ask
if you have been fed well.

by ties of memory and blood.

It seems your mother
and I have produced

45:18.000 --> 45:20.651
a son that is
both strong and wise.

45:24.280 --> 45:27.762
And if my sister had lived,
she would have been the same.

45:28.840 --> 45:30.001
Yes.

45:30.760 --> 45:33.969
And you are right to carry
her memory, as do I.

For a long time, Father, I feel
I have carried nothing else

45:41.240 --> 45:43.208
but memories.

45:43.920 --> 45:46.082
But now, here,
in this place,

45:47.200 --> 45:51.364
with you and with my
mother, I feel reborn.

45:52.160 --> 45:54.242
As if I have
a life to lead.

46:02.480 --> 46:05.845
Far too long.
