WEBVTT

00:01.294 --> 00:03.285
Previously on Farscape.

00:03.379 --> 00:05.870
We're not gonna give up
on her, John.

00:05.965 --> 00:08.331
I gave you a chance.

00:08.426 --> 00:10.212
Where is Crichton?

00:10.303 --> 00:11.509
I don't know.

00:11.596 --> 00:14.303
I'm gonna need your help,

00:14.390 --> 00:16.346
Mr. Scarran half-breed.

00:16.434 --> 00:19.471
Aeryn for wormholes.

00:19.562 --> 00:23.146
lwill help if you taste.

00:25.401 --> 00:27.187
I know why she's
reacting like this.

00:27.278 --> 00:29.109
Stop.
-Do not interfere.

00:29.197 --> 00:30.733
She's with child.

00:30.823 --> 00:34.361
Scarran heat probe will kill
a pregnant Sebacean.

00:36.579 --> 00:38.319
Whose child is inside you?

00:38.414 --> 00:40.200
Is it John Crichton's?

00:40.291 --> 00:42.247
I don't know.

00:42.335 --> 00:44.200
If this is Crichton's child,

00:44.295 --> 00:48.038
we could learn all he knows
about the wormholes
from this fetal DNA.

00:48.132 --> 00:49.963
Get me out!

00:50.927 --> 00:52.383
Out!

00:53.095 --> 00:55.802
And now, on Farscape.

00:57.600 --> 01:01.593
Pilot:
The Scarran Border Station has
given us permission to dock.

01:01.687 --> 01:05.430
Moya senses three
other vessels present.

01:05.524 --> 01:07.560
One is our own Transport Pod.

01:07.652 --> 01:09.608
Well that means Sikozu
made it okay.

01:09.695 --> 01:12.232
Getting here is the easy part.
-She'll be fine.

01:12.323 --> 01:14.530
The Scarrans will just think
she's another Kalish bureaucrat.

01:14.617 --> 01:17.859
Yeah, and I'm supposed to
be a Peacekeeper.

01:17.954 --> 01:21.572
I love waiting to see how
things go south.

01:22.833 --> 01:25.085
All vessels en route
to Katratzi

01:25.169 --> 01:27.626
must stop for inspection
and quarantine.

01:27.713 --> 01:30.329
The procedure takes
five solar days.

01:30.424 --> 01:35.088
Any vessel lacking the proper
security clearance beacon
will be destroyed on sight.

01:35.179 --> 01:37.135
That's very reassuring.

01:40.101 --> 01:43.013
We will find her.

01:43.104 --> 01:45.265
We'll get Aeryn back.

01:45.356 --> 01:46.562
No matter what.

01:46.649 --> 01:48.105
Pilot:
Docking completed.

01:48.192 --> 01:51.184
Permit station personnel to
board, but monitor them.

01:51.279 --> 01:54.646
I understand, Captain Wentrask.

01:54.740 --> 01:56.401
Chiana:
Wentrask?

01:56.492 --> 01:59.655
We must assume that all
Comms transmissions are
being intercepted.

01:59.745 --> 02:02.077
BUt OUl' Comms are secure.

02:02.957 --> 02:05.243
Let's just pretend they aren't.

02:06.836 --> 02:08.167
Captain Wentrask?

02:08.254 --> 02:11.496
lam Dr. Trayso Talnell,
Chief Medical Officer.

02:11.590 --> 02:15.424
Yes, yes, yes.
Another Kalish functionary.
Are these necessary?

02:15.511 --> 02:19.629
Your entire vessel must
be checked for contraband
and contaminants.

02:19.724 --> 02:21.009
We have neither aboard.

02:21.100 --> 02:23.386
I should hope not.

02:25.563 --> 02:27.929
A, um, Peacekeeper?

02:28.024 --> 02:29.264
You are remarkably perceptive.

02:29.358 --> 02:32.100
How do you come to have a
Peacekeeper aboard?

02:32.194 --> 02:34.276
What gave you the impression
I answer to you?

02:34.363 --> 02:39.232
With due respect, Captain,
you will either respond
to my inquiries

02:39.327 --> 02:42.865
or you will be denied entry
into Scarran space.

02:42.955 --> 02:44.365
Understood?

02:47.460 --> 02:49.416
The Peacekeeper is a spy
for the Scarrans.

02:49.503 --> 02:52.461
Also on board we have a
Nebari and a Hynerian.

02:52.548 --> 02:54.163
They are spies as well.

02:54.258 --> 02:58.217
The Hierarchy will not look
kindly on a Kalish

02:58.304 --> 03:00.590
who obstructs their delivery.

03:00.681 --> 03:02.217
Understood?

03:06.354 --> 03:08.970
Do you have anything to eat
on board this station?

03:09.065 --> 03:12.182
Refreshments may be obtained
in the station commons.

03:12.276 --> 03:16.440
Be aware that no weapons are
permitted on the station, and...

03:16.530 --> 03:19.112
you will be checked.

03:19.200 --> 03:23.739
Our Sentinels are programmed
to shoot and kill any
armed visitors.

03:27.500 --> 03:28.831
Keep an eye on that.

03:28.918 --> 03:30.374
( soft squawk)

03:34.423 --> 03:38.883
All the visitors you get, all
the fantastic technology you
get to work with...

03:38.969 --> 03:40.925
Chiana:
Looks like she's found
a new friend.

03:41.013 --> 03:43.049
One of her own kind.

03:43.140 --> 03:45.882
Oh. And not too bad
looking, at that.

03:45.976 --> 03:49.389
Rygel:
Sikozu thinks with her head,
not her kuzitza.

03:49.480 --> 03:51.846
Chiana:
Yeah, that's her problem.

03:51.941 --> 03:54.102
Rygel:
We were smart to
send her ahead.

03:54.193 --> 03:57.230
The Kalish are definitely
running things around here.

03:57.321 --> 03:59.937
Scorpius:
They are a conquered species.

04:00.032 --> 04:03.240
They serve the Scarrans
in order to survive.

04:03.327 --> 04:05.283
You mean, they're collaborators.

04:05.371 --> 04:10.240
I'll bet you could.
Diplomatic missions throughout
Tormented Space.

04:10.334 --> 04:12.916
You must lead an
interesting life.

04:13.003 --> 04:14.743
Suppose so.

04:14.839 --> 04:17.546
I'm getting tired of the
incessant travel, though.

04:17.633 --> 04:21.546
I envy you and your
stable position here.

04:21.637 --> 04:24.049
Running this station
isn't stable.

04:24.140 --> 04:25.300
It's boring.

04:25.391 --> 04:28.428
Sikozu:
Karohm, your work isn't
boring in the slightest.

04:28.519 --> 04:30.259
Karohm:
Maybe we should trade jobs.

04:31.397 --> 04:33.308
I must get back.

04:33.399 --> 04:34.605
Meet me later.

04:34.692 --> 04:36.353
Sikozu:
In a while.

04:46.245 --> 04:48.281
Got anything to tell me?

04:48.372 --> 04:49.578
Aeryn is here.

04:49.665 --> 04:50.529
Say that again.

04:50.624 --> 04:52.205
Aeryn is here.

04:52.293 --> 04:54.079
Where?
-In the Scarran freighter.

04:54.170 --> 04:56.786
The Scarran freighter has
finished its time in quarantine

04:56.881 --> 04:59.418
and it's leaving in
half an em.

05:05.097 --> 05:11.184
This won't harm the baby,
but it will keep you docile.

05:11.270 --> 05:12.510
See?

05:12.605 --> 05:15.972
I could make things so much
easier for you.

05:17.318 --> 05:20.025
If only you'd trust me.

05:28.245 --> 05:32.158
My name is John Crichton,
an astronaut.

05:32.249 --> 05:35.992
Three years ago I got shot
through a wormhole.

05:36.086 --> 05:37.872
I'm in a distant part
of the universe

05:37.963 --> 05:41.171
aboard this living ship of
escaped prisoners,

05:41.258 --> 05:42.998
my friends.

05:44.094 --> 05:45.880
I've made enemies.

05:45.971 --> 05:49.213
Powerful, dangerous.

05:49.308 --> 05:52.800
Now all I want is to
find a way home

05:52.895 --> 05:55.682
to warn Earth.

05:55.773 --> 06:00.858
Look upward and share
the wonders I've seen.

06:30.724 --> 06:33.340
Chiana:
Half an am? What can we do
in half an em?

06:33.435 --> 06:35.517
Crichton:
We grab our guns and
we kick in some doors.

06:35.604 --> 06:37.890
Scorpius:
We wouldn't even pass
through this station.

06:37.982 --> 06:42.442
The Scarran Sentinels are
programmed to kill any
non-station personnel carrying weapons.

06:42.528 --> 06:43.938
We have a hold card.

06:44.029 --> 06:46.645
D'Argo and Noranti are
hanging back in Lo'La.

06:46.740 --> 06:50.403
If D'Argo's ship attacked
a Scarran freighter,

06:50.494 --> 06:54.783
a fleet of Scarran warships
would instantly be
dispatched after us.

06:54.873 --> 06:57.865
Besides, the freighter has
Aeryn as a hostage.

06:57.960 --> 07:01.168
We have a far greater chance
here than at any Scarran
military base.

07:01.255 --> 07:05.794
Hence we need to keep that
freighter here long enough
to come up with a plan.

07:05.884 --> 07:07.420
Pass me all that food.

07:07.511 --> 07:10.253
It's a hell of a time to
be eating, Rygel.

07:10.347 --> 07:13.339
Rygel:
l have an idea. Get me more.

07:13.434 --> 07:17.347
Ralnaht:
The freighter will be clear to
depart within a quarter arn.

07:17.438 --> 07:19.724
Time enough for a refreshment.

07:21.609 --> 07:26.069
A Scarran Captain with a Charrid
sidekick, just like Sikozu said.

07:29.908 --> 07:35.278
Jenek:
He charged you far too much
for that raslek. One of your many weaknesses.

07:37.082 --> 07:38.492
Povek neetranko.

07:38.584 --> 07:39.915
Povek.

07:40.002 --> 07:41.913
May we speak?

07:42.004 --> 07:44.165
Leave us.

07:44.256 --> 07:45.996
(soft menacing growl )

07:53.223 --> 07:56.431
Now, listen carefully.
My name is Captain Wentrask.

07:56.518 --> 07:59.851
My mission demands
absolute secrecy.

07:59.938 --> 08:03.681
My proof code is zenark devra
zenark prida.

08:03.776 --> 08:05.437
(mirthless chuckle)

08:05.527 --> 08:08.314
Ministry of Dissimulation?

08:08.405 --> 08:11.238
Well, don't worry, Captain, you
have little to fear from me.

08:11.325 --> 08:16.490
l have no interest in spies
and their intricate games.

08:16.580 --> 08:19.196
lam Jenek in command
of freighter.

08:19.291 --> 08:22.124
You have your mission
and l have mine.

08:22.211 --> 08:23.997
Scorpius:
So, as it should be.

08:24.088 --> 08:25.919
( soft growl )

08:34.306 --> 08:35.637
A half-breed.

08:35.724 --> 08:38.306
Of no concern to us.

08:38.394 --> 08:40.259
Ready the ship to leave.

08:56.954 --> 08:59.036
It's time.

09:00.207 --> 09:02.289
You're doing good.

09:08.382 --> 09:10.293
You're doing great.

09:17.516 --> 09:19.472
(grunts)

09:22.730 --> 09:24.641
Vreena:
Why do you keep on struggling?

09:24.732 --> 09:26.973
You know it won't do
you any good.

09:27.067 --> 09:29.183
(grunting)

09:29.278 --> 09:31.234
Must I keep sedating you?

09:31.321 --> 09:32.652
(grunting)

09:32.740 --> 09:35.527
Must you keep making things
difficult for yourself?

09:35.617 --> 09:37.118
( crying )

09:37.202 --> 09:39.113
There's no point in fighting.

09:39.204 --> 09:41.911
You know that.

09:41.999 --> 09:44.911
(muffled whimpering )

09:47.337 --> 09:49.168
Crichton:
That's enough.
You're gonna bust a gut.

09:49.256 --> 09:52.419
That's enough, all right.
Give me a microt.

09:52.509 --> 09:54.921
Sebacean?
(Rygel gagging)

09:55.012 --> 09:58.175
From the freighter.
Sikozu thinks she's a nurse.

09:58.265 --> 10:00.426
Chiana:
Not good. It's another person
you've gotta fool.

10:00.517 --> 10:04.180
Rygel:
This will be convincing.
Stand back.

10:04.271 --> 10:06.182
(retching and moaning)

10:06.273 --> 10:07.604
Hey, you all right?

10:07.691 --> 10:10.353
(retching and moaning louder)
Don't feel well.

10:11.320 --> 10:14.357
(retching and burping)

10:17.951 --> 10:19.816
What's the matter with him?

10:19.912 --> 10:21.743
Maybe it's your lousy food.

10:21.830 --> 10:23.991
Yes, I'm sure of it.

10:24.082 --> 10:27.245
Have you ever had an emesis
of this severity before?

10:27.336 --> 10:29.998
Just once, but they cured it.

10:30.088 --> 10:31.589
And what was the cause?

10:31.673 --> 10:34.289
A touch of dermaphollica.

10:34.384 --> 10:36.921
That's a highly
contagious disease.

10:37.012 --> 10:40.129
Oh, don't worry.
They said it was dormant.

10:40.224 --> 10:42.715
We're in lockdown until
further notice.

10:42.810 --> 10:45.643
Anchor all vessels to
their docking ports.

10:45.729 --> 10:47.765
No, you can't keep us here.

10:47.856 --> 10:51.144
Uh, I can, and, uh, I must.

10:51.235 --> 10:54.978
Uh, under the quarantine policy
of your hierarchy.

10:55.072 --> 10:58.530
Have you any evidence the
Hynerian's condition
poses a risk?

10:58.617 --> 11:01.950
No, but I must err on the
side of caution.

11:02.037 --> 11:05.450
I am unfamiliar with
Hynerian dermaphollica.

11:05.541 --> 11:11.252
However, I have asked the
medical database at Simstef
for information.

11:11.338 --> 11:12.999
They're transmitting it now.

11:13.090 --> 11:16.332
I've also sent out a request
for all vessels in the sector

11:16.426 --> 11:19.509
for doctors or healers with any
knowledge of the disease.

11:19.596 --> 11:21.882
That's not procedure.

11:21.974 --> 11:27.310
But, uh, under the
circumstances, it's a
very good idea.

11:29.314 --> 11:31.225
Thanks for suggesting it.

11:32.568 --> 11:35.856
I don't know why everyone's
afraid of a few germs.

11:35.946 --> 11:37.652
Yeah, me neither.

11:37.739 --> 11:39.320
This'll kill them.

11:39.408 --> 11:41.490
Mmm, these'll kill anything.

11:41.577 --> 11:43.488
(laughing)

11:46.373 --> 11:50.833
Greetings. lam Trayso Talnell,
Chief Medical Officer.

11:52.337 --> 11:53.543
Thank you for coming.

11:53.630 --> 11:56.542
Utu Noranti Pralatong,
alleviator and healer.

11:56.633 --> 11:59.295
And this is my
personal assistant.

11:59.386 --> 12:02.253
You may remain here
if you choose.

12:02.347 --> 12:04.383
Yes, healer.

12:06.268 --> 12:07.974
A Luxan assistant?

12:08.061 --> 12:11.019
Oh, yes. Luxans make fine
pilots, exceptional bodyguards

12:11.106 --> 12:13.813
and superlative lovers.
( chuckling )

12:20.324 --> 12:21.860
Data from Simstef.

12:21.950 --> 12:23.235
Thank you.
-Shhh.

12:23.327 --> 12:25.283
(moaning softly)

12:27.497 --> 12:32.036
Apparently we've brought you
here for nothing, healer.

12:32.127 --> 12:34.118
This isn't dermaphollica at all.

12:34.212 --> 12:36.498
Oh, it's too soon
to tell, I'd say.

12:36.590 --> 12:41.926
Uh, per this report, he should
have exhibited signs of skin
sloughing by now.

12:42.012 --> 12:44.924
May I see that?

12:45.015 --> 12:49.133
Yes, well, you see,
dermaphollica is very
difficult to diagnose.

12:49.227 --> 12:53.220
The bacteria that causes the
virus is effectively
undetectable.

12:53.315 --> 12:55.772
Yes, but none of the other
symptoms are present.

12:55.859 --> 12:59.568
Hence, unless anything else
manifests itself in say,

12:59.655 --> 13:03.819
ooh, an am, I can safely
lift lockdown.

13:03.909 --> 13:06.400
I'm going to examine
the patient.

13:09.164 --> 13:13.123
(Rygel moaning)

13:18.256 --> 13:22.090
And you're sure that what you
had was dermaphollica?

13:22.177 --> 13:25.340
Yes. I barely survived.

13:25.430 --> 13:27.421
Four of my wives didn't.

13:28.976 --> 13:29.886
Here.

13:29.977 --> 13:32.343
Hmm? No. Mmml

13:35.065 --> 13:36.054
Ow!

13:36.149 --> 13:37.605
Swallow.

13:41.863 --> 13:44.354
Was that absolutely essential?

13:44.449 --> 13:46.064
Absolutely.

13:46.159 --> 13:49.947
Chiana (softly):
So tell me. Do you wanna
get outta here?

13:50.038 --> 13:51.494
Zepa:
Well, it's getting a bit warm.

13:51.581 --> 13:54.197
Maybe we should find some
place we can cool down.

13:54.292 --> 13:55.202
Get comfortable.

13:55.293 --> 13:56.999
Chiana:
Gotta suggestion?

13:57.087 --> 13:58.293
( D'Argo sighs)

13:58.380 --> 14:00.917
( softly talking )

14:01.508 --> 14:03.794
What news, healer?

14:04.261 --> 14:06.627
None yet.

14:06.722 --> 14:08.428
We'll just have to wait.

14:08.515 --> 14:10.176
Zepa:
Maybe you'd like to go
and see my ship.

14:10.267 --> 14:12.804
Chiana:
Well, is it a very big ship?

14:12.894 --> 14:16.762
Size isn't as important as
speed and maneuverability.

14:16.857 --> 14:20.270
Oh, yeah? That's what
they all say that.

14:20.360 --> 14:21.975
Come with me and I'll prove it.

14:22.070 --> 14:24.106
D'Argo:
Excuse me.

14:24.740 --> 14:26.480
Hey, Nebari girl.

14:26.575 --> 14:28.531
How about I buy you a drink?

14:28.618 --> 14:31.200
Um, I was here first.

14:33.331 --> 14:34.741
Your point?

14:40.005 --> 14:41.836
( sniffs )

14:53.268 --> 14:56.135
(whispering ):
Much better.

14:57.689 --> 15:00.431
Rygel's scam seems
to be working.

15:01.234 --> 15:04.067
So you know.

15:04.154 --> 15:09.148
One of the voices on the medical
distress transmission was
Sikozu's, so we played along.

15:10.243 --> 15:12.985
Smart Luxan.

15:14.456 --> 15:17.664
It seems your caution
was justified.

15:17.751 --> 15:20.458
His skin is sloughing.

15:25.092 --> 15:27.708
(groaning softly)

15:27.803 --> 15:31.671
The lockdown will remain
in effect.

15:31.765 --> 15:34.256
(groaning)

15:34.351 --> 15:36.933
How contagious is this disease?

15:37.020 --> 15:41.059
It can infect non-Hynerians and
those it does infect, it kills
without warning.

15:41.149 --> 15:43.231
Frell that. I'm gonna lock
myself in an airlock.

15:43.318 --> 15:45.024
I'm afraid it's far
too late for that.

15:45.112 --> 15:48.229
And this virus is so pervasive
that everyone on this station

15:48.323 --> 15:51.656
or any vessels docked to it
has already been exposed.

15:51.743 --> 15:53.153
So what do we do?

15:53.245 --> 15:55.406
I can attempt to concoct
a cure.

15:55.497 --> 15:57.203
However, my ship is
understocked.

15:57.290 --> 16:00.282
I need herbs, medications,
healing potions.

16:00.377 --> 16:02.163
Do you have you any sort
of medical supplies?

16:02.254 --> 16:04.119
I mean, even a simple
remedy kit will do.

16:04.214 --> 16:06.455
No. No one may board my vessel.

16:06.550 --> 16:09.212
Scorpius:
l have a facility on
board my Leviathan.

16:09.302 --> 16:11.463
I offer it for your use.

16:13.598 --> 16:15.429
Escort her.

16:18.687 --> 16:20.143
Thank you.

16:20.230 --> 16:22.346
Crichton:
That was a nice job, Granny.
You scammed 'em.

16:22.440 --> 16:23.520
I couldn't scam Trayso.

16:23.608 --> 16:25.314
But you did. He believes
Rygel's sick.

16:25.402 --> 16:26.892
That's because I made
Rygel sick.

16:26.987 --> 16:29.194
No, you made him look sick.
-No, I made him sick.

16:29.281 --> 16:30.487
With what?

16:30.574 --> 16:32.815
Dermaphollica. The virus is
dormant in his system.

16:32.909 --> 16:34.285
l merely reactivated it.

16:34.369 --> 16:36.860
Can you deactivate it?
-I hope so.

16:36.955 --> 16:39.913
And what if you can't?
-He dies.

16:44.963 --> 16:46.328
Chiana:
Are you tenked?

16:46.423 --> 16:48.004
What are you trying to do,
what, kill Rygel?

16:48.091 --> 16:50.548
No. He won't die.
I can make a cure.

16:50.635 --> 16:52.045
You sure about that?

16:52.137 --> 16:53.126
I'm almost certain.

16:53.221 --> 16:54.256
How long has Rygel got?

16:54.347 --> 16:56.212
Plenty of time if I'm
not disturbed.

16:57.225 --> 16:58.931
Is this bug contagious?

16:59.019 --> 17:00.179
Some varieties can be.

17:00.270 --> 17:02.761
Uh-huh. What about this variety?

17:02.856 --> 17:05.097
I'll fix it.
-Well, you've already fixed it.

17:05.192 --> 17:07.353
You've... you've infected
us with the frelling
Hynerian plague!

17:07.444 --> 17:10.106
Not infected, exposed.

17:10.197 --> 17:12.062
Anyway, you can't get it.

17:12.157 --> 17:13.112
I can't?

17:13.200 --> 17:14.815
Nebari are immune,
as are Scarrans.

17:14.910 --> 17:16.366
And Sebaceans?

17:19.581 --> 17:22.197
Are Sebaceans immune?

17:24.461 --> 17:25.701
No.

17:27.881 --> 17:30.122
You'll kill Aeryn even before
we get a chance to save her!

17:30.217 --> 17:32.799
Don't you say that!
Don't you dare say that!

17:34.304 --> 17:36.090
|wi|| fix this!

17:38.433 --> 17:41.095
You wanted a plague,
I gave you one.

17:41.186 --> 17:44.269
Without real symptoms,
the lockdown is lifted,

17:44.356 --> 17:46.517
Aeryn is on her way to
the Scarran base,

17:46.608 --> 17:50.100
and you are frelled.

17:51.571 --> 17:54.153
Now I did what I had to.

17:54.241 --> 17:56.823
I suggest you do the same.

17:56.910 --> 17:58.866
You don't understand.

17:58.954 --> 18:01.320
l have a patient I must protect.

18:01.414 --> 18:04.656
Your passenger has already been
exposed, as have we all.

18:04.751 --> 18:08.790
But the facilities on Katratzi
are much more likely
to have a cure.

18:08.880 --> 18:10.962
Oh, so you'd expose them
as well, would you?

18:11.049 --> 18:13.256
Scarrans are immune to
this disease.

18:13.343 --> 18:14.799
But Kalish aren't.

18:14.886 --> 18:17.377
I won't be held responsible
for loosing a virus

18:17.472 --> 18:20.760
that could prove catastrophic
to my own people.

18:20.850 --> 18:23.637
Your vessel isn't leaving,
Captain.

18:23.728 --> 18:27.812
Karohm:
The healer has requested that
we allow the patient to be moved aboard the Leviathan.

18:27.899 --> 18:29.685
Easier to take tissue
samples that way.

18:29.776 --> 18:33.689
What? Release the Hynerian
from isolation?

18:33.780 --> 18:37.739
Given the pervasiveness of the
virus, isolation is pointless.

18:37.826 --> 18:39.316
See to it.

18:41.288 --> 18:44.951
What in the frelling yotz were
you thinking, you madwoman?

18:45.041 --> 18:50.627
You're a plague! A withered,
three-eyed, bad-smelling
pestilence!

18:50.714 --> 18:52.250
You can shout at me later.

18:52.340 --> 18:54.046
I'll be dead later!

18:54.134 --> 18:58.002
You'll be dead sooner if I
don't devise a remedy.

19:01.933 --> 19:04.049
Noranti's is the only possible
course, John.

19:04.144 --> 19:05.509
And what has it bought us?

19:05.603 --> 19:06.888
Time.

19:06.980 --> 19:09.141
And what are we doing
with that time?

19:09.232 --> 19:11.393
Can't answer that? Right.

19:11.484 --> 19:13.475
That's why someone's gotta
get on that freighter.

19:13.570 --> 19:16.937
Sikozu was working on it.
If she can access schematics
of the freighter...

19:17.032 --> 19:19.523
Schematics are not going to
give us Aeryn's location,

19:19.617 --> 19:22.233
her condition or tell us how
many guards there are.

19:22.329 --> 19:23.739
Someone has gotta go in.

19:23.830 --> 19:26.321
You can't possibly believe
that Captain Jenek will
give you a tour?

19:26.416 --> 19:31.501
Grasshopper! You aim too high,
and Jenek is not the only one
with access.

19:44.851 --> 19:46.466
Hey.

19:47.270 --> 19:49.101
Sebacean.

19:49.189 --> 19:50.349
What?

19:50.440 --> 19:52.351
You're Sebacean, right?

19:52.442 --> 19:54.307
Huh?

19:55.320 --> 19:58.232
Can't remember the last time
I saw a Sebacean woman.

19:58.323 --> 20:00.985
It's gotta be at least
half a cycle.

20:01.284 --> 20:03.320
So?

20:03.411 --> 20:06.653
So that's a long time
without companionship.

20:08.416 --> 20:09.952
ldon't do aliens.

20:10.043 --> 20:14.286
Well, I don't do Peacekeepers,
so why waste your time?

20:18.093 --> 20:19.924
What's that?

20:22.430 --> 20:27.049
This is something for
a special friend.

20:27.143 --> 20:30.806
It's the Sebacean cure for
Hynerian dermaphollica.

20:30.897 --> 20:33.559
Or a vial of dust.

20:34.567 --> 20:37.024
You're a medical worker, right?

20:37.112 --> 20:39.819
I could let you analyze it,

20:41.449 --> 20:44.316
but as you say,
why waste your time?

20:44.411 --> 20:46.322
Where did you get that?

20:46.413 --> 20:49.655
Sorry, I don't kiss and tell.

20:49.749 --> 20:53.617
But you can be sure you're not
gettin' it anywhere else.

20:53.711 --> 20:56.874
Hynerian dermaphollica rarely
infects Sebaceans.

20:56.965 --> 21:00.753
When it does, you're dead
before you know it.

21:02.345 --> 21:04.506
I hate odds like that.

21:06.391 --> 21:08.131
Don't you?

21:09.144 --> 21:12.636
So, what do you want for it?

21:12.730 --> 21:14.982
ljust wanna share.

21:18.820 --> 21:20.560
Charrid Guard:
No admittance, Peacekeeper.

21:20.655 --> 21:22.065
He's with me.

21:22.157 --> 21:24.022
(door opens)

21:32.792 --> 21:35.204
(whispers ):
Give me a microt.

21:37.005 --> 21:38.996
So this your med bay?

21:39.257 --> 21:41.043
Mm-hmm.

21:45.054 --> 21:46.305
Spare bunks.

21:46.389 --> 21:48.471
(metallic clunking)

21:51.436 --> 21:52.926
Fun later.

21:53.021 --> 21:54.932
Cure now.

21:59.819 --> 22:01.980
It's a dehydrated concentrate,
is it not?

22:02.071 --> 22:04.357
Right. Dilute it ten to one.
Saline.

22:04.449 --> 22:06.690
There's enough there
for both of us.

22:06.784 --> 22:08.320
No more?

22:08.786 --> 22:12.119
No. Why?

22:12.207 --> 22:15.244
Another Sebacean needs
treatment.

22:19.380 --> 22:21.416
( softly )
You bastard.

22:23.259 --> 22:26.672
Well, it's too bad for them.

22:27.805 --> 22:28.669
(thud)

22:28.765 --> 22:30.426
(metallic clinking)

22:33.478 --> 22:34.843
Aeryn.

22:34.938 --> 22:36.348
Wake up.

22:36.439 --> 22:37.770
(groaning softly)

22:37.857 --> 22:39.597
Just hold... hold still.

22:39.692 --> 22:42.183
Hol... hold still. I need to...
I need to unbind these.

22:42.278 --> 22:43.108
No.

22:43.196 --> 22:44.356
No, it's me. I'm real. Aeryn.

22:44.447 --> 22:45.402
(whimpering)

22:45.490 --> 22:47.105
Shh!

22:47.200 --> 22:48.280
Shh!

22:48.368 --> 22:49.574
(whimpering)

22:49.661 --> 22:51.117
Shh...

22:51.204 --> 22:54.321
Leave her alone.

22:54.415 --> 22:57.248
Crichton:
Don't do anything stupid.

22:57.335 --> 23:00.702
Scarran Hierarchy paid
good crindars for me.

23:00.797 --> 23:03.960
They wouldn't want the package
delivered damaged.

23:06.928 --> 23:08.259
(grunts)

23:13.560 --> 23:15.266
( screaming )

23:15.353 --> 23:18.561
Vreena:
He claimed it was a cure for
Hynerian dermaphollica.

23:18.648 --> 23:20.354
But was it genuine?

23:20.441 --> 23:22.352
No, it's a fake.

23:22.443 --> 23:24.354
Why the deception?

23:24.445 --> 23:25.776
'Cause... horny.

23:25.863 --> 23:27.239
Umm...

23:27.323 --> 23:29.109
Just lookin' for a
Sebacean woman.

23:29.200 --> 23:32.988
Vreena:
You attacked me and attempted
to release one of the patients.

23:33.079 --> 23:35.320
Hey, no offense,

23:35.415 --> 23:37.576
but she's sexier than you are.

23:37.667 --> 23:39.874
Jenek:
What would you have done
had you gotten her?

23:39.961 --> 23:41.997
Taken her back to my ship...

23:42.463 --> 23:43.748
frelled her...

23:43.840 --> 23:45.376
made babies.

23:45.466 --> 23:46.876
(hissing)

23:46.968 --> 23:51.257
Jenek, what are you doing
with my Peacekeeper?

23:51.347 --> 23:56.307
Jenek:
Your Peacekeeper was aboard my
ship attempting to recreate.

23:58.229 --> 24:00.265
Is that true?

24:01.357 --> 24:04.315
Yeah. More or less.

24:04.402 --> 24:07.519
If you'll excuse us,
I will deal with him.

24:07.614 --> 24:09.650
( low growl )

24:13.369 --> 24:17.487
I said, I will deal with him.

24:24.547 --> 24:26.083
(growling)

24:31.054 --> 24:33.636
Aah, that's a hell of a thing.

24:36.225 --> 24:38.682
(groaning)

24:38.770 --> 24:41.182
John, how did you lie to
Jenek's heat probe?

24:41.272 --> 24:43.684
Was it Katoya's training?

24:43.775 --> 24:47.267
Ha! Nah, I told him the truth.

24:47.362 --> 24:49.444
Just not the whole truth.

24:50.031 --> 24:51.771
(grunts)

24:51.866 --> 24:54.903
Aeryn's in there.
We gotta get her out.

24:54.994 --> 24:59.829
Sikozu is gathering information
which will help us put together
a rescue plan.

24:59.916 --> 25:02.532
We will free Officer Sun.

25:02.627 --> 25:04.743
(grunting)

25:04.837 --> 25:06.702
(groaning)

25:06.798 --> 25:12.338
The Rosrob Center sent us all
their data on dermaphollica,
but it isn't much.

25:12.428 --> 25:15.795
And I still can't get
a response from the
Diagnosans on Coldjen.

25:15.890 --> 25:17.846
(slaps the panel)
Frell!

25:19.894 --> 25:22.556
Why don't you take a
rest interval?

25:22.647 --> 25:25.639
I can monitor communications
for you.

25:27.068 --> 25:31.277
This will boost your
Hynerian antibodies

25:31.364 --> 25:34.231
and cleanse you of the disease.

25:34.325 --> 25:35.861
Open.

25:38.287 --> 25:39.663
(gulping)

25:39.747 --> 25:44.286
Unfortunately, it won't cure
anyone other than a Hynerian.

25:44.377 --> 25:45.913
And that's a problem?

25:46.003 --> 25:50.542
I mean, uh, has anyone else
contracted the sickness?

25:50.633 --> 25:51.998
No, not as yet.

25:52.093 --> 25:53.128
Oh.

25:53.219 --> 25:55.210
And they may not.

25:55.304 --> 25:57.135
But there's always a chance.

25:57.223 --> 25:58.929
Mm-mm...

25:59.016 --> 26:00.802
(gasping)

26:05.898 --> 26:07.308
Rygel?

26:16.659 --> 26:18.195
Rygel!

26:26.627 --> 26:27.787
Hey.

26:27.879 --> 26:29.744
Hey, you with the big ship.

26:29.839 --> 26:32.296
( muffled choking )

26:33.634 --> 26:35.625
(coughing)

26:35.720 --> 26:37.256
Hey, you okay?

26:37.346 --> 26:39.928
We may have another victim.
Come on.

26:41.559 --> 26:43.140
Chiana:
Somebody?

26:43.227 --> 26:44.967
Somebody call the healer.

26:45.062 --> 26:46.973
( screaming )
-Hey, what are you doing?

26:47.064 --> 26:48.270
Don't run away! Get...

26:48.357 --> 26:49.517
( choking )
-lt's okay.

26:49.609 --> 26:50.974
It's all right. It's okay.

26:51.068 --> 26:52.649
We're... we're gonna
get the healer.

26:52.737 --> 26:54.648
( choking )

26:54.739 --> 26:59.859
Dermaphollica has proven fatal
to a Kalish traveler.

26:59.952 --> 27:03.160
Captain Jenek requests your
presence aboard his vessel.

27:03.247 --> 27:06.239
No, no, no, no.
I must find this remedy.

27:06.334 --> 27:08.290
He may come here if he chooses.

27:08.377 --> 27:11.869
No, he wants you to go to him.

27:11.964 --> 27:15.297
The healer needs more
resources than are available
to make a cure.

27:15.384 --> 27:18.672
If there's anything aboard your
vessel that would assist...

27:18.763 --> 27:22.176
You must realize we have
a common problem.

27:22.266 --> 27:25.178
We both have cargo that
needs protecting.

27:26.562 --> 27:29.099
I'll solve my own problems.

27:43.913 --> 27:47.155
Sikozu:
The Scarran freighter is not
only docked to the station,

27:47.250 --> 27:49.536
but it is tied to its
power grid as well.

27:49.627 --> 27:53.745
From station control, I can
force a power surge that will
disrupt the circuits

27:53.840 --> 27:55.501
of both the station and
the freighter.

27:55.591 --> 27:58.958
That'll knock out the lights,
the alarms and those ugly
Scarran DRDs.

27:59.053 --> 28:00.293
For how long?

28:00.388 --> 28:02.879
Only until emergency overrides
activate. Maybe 30 microts.

28:02.974 --> 28:07.183
Okay. Once we rescue Aeryn,
we've gotta get Moya
off that station.

28:07.270 --> 28:10.558
Yes, I think I've worked
out how to bypass the
docking locks.

28:10.648 --> 28:12.263
You think?

28:12.358 --> 28:13.859
What were you doing with
Karohm all this time?

28:13.943 --> 28:15.934
What about the window
stickers this joint's
supposed to give out?

28:16.028 --> 28:17.689
Security beacons.
We'll need some.

28:17.780 --> 28:19.281
If we rescue Aeryn...

28:19.365 --> 28:21.151
Don't say "if."

28:21.242 --> 28:22.277
I'm sorry. Yes.

28:22.368 --> 28:24.404
When we rescue Aeryn,

28:24.495 --> 28:26.986
we simply Starburst away
from Scarran space...

28:27.081 --> 28:29.447
What if we Starburst deeper
into Scarran space?

28:29.542 --> 28:31.282
Or if the freighter
takes off with Aeryn.

28:31.377 --> 28:33.959
If the freighter escapes,
then we abandon all hope...

28:34.046 --> 28:37.254
We abandon all hope of leading
long and prosperous lives,

28:37.341 --> 28:39.172
and we follow the freighter.

28:40.887 --> 28:42.377
(sighs)

28:43.264 --> 28:45.300
She's still learning.

28:52.023 --> 28:53.433
Noranti:
You don't have to use force.

28:53.524 --> 28:55.765
I want to find a cure
as much as you do.

28:55.860 --> 28:59.068
You will find a cure,
and we will have it first.

28:59.155 --> 29:01.146
Nurse, assist them.

29:01.240 --> 29:02.446
Nurse, didn't you...

29:02.533 --> 29:03.739
(growling exhale)

29:03.826 --> 29:04.781
Check the patient.

29:04.869 --> 29:06.609
Noranti:
I'll do it.

29:08.289 --> 29:09.950
( groaning )
-Save your strength.

29:10.041 --> 29:11.497
Don't try to speak.

29:15.046 --> 29:16.627
She doesn't appear to
be infected.

29:16.714 --> 29:18.124
Well, neither was my nurse.

29:18.215 --> 29:21.423
If she's infected,
can you cure her?

29:21.510 --> 29:23.341
I think I can, given time.

29:23.429 --> 29:27.342
Jenek:
The female is pregnant.
Her fetus must be saved.

29:27.433 --> 29:30.175
Is there a suitable recipient
for transplant?

29:30.269 --> 29:31.884
What?

29:32.688 --> 29:33.973
No!

29:34.065 --> 29:36.181
Anyway, it wouldn't
do any good.

29:36.275 --> 29:40.234
All the females here are equally
at risk from this disease.

29:40.321 --> 29:41.982
What about the Nebari girl?

29:42.073 --> 29:44.234
Nebari are immune.

29:44.325 --> 29:46.236
Go to the Leviathan and
bring back the Nebari.

29:46.327 --> 29:49.160
We can't take our weapons
through the station.

29:49.246 --> 29:52.909
Then take a Transport Pod and
board from the outside.

29:56.170 --> 29:58.456
(Aeryn moaning)

29:58.547 --> 30:00.378
Noranti:
Hush, now.

30:00.967 --> 30:02.673
Hush.

30:10.267 --> 30:12.553
( growling )
-Hey.

30:12.645 --> 30:14.510
Get out of my way, fek-face.

30:14.605 --> 30:16.015
Hey, let me go.

30:16.107 --> 30:17.643
(grunts)

30:20.945 --> 30:22.060
( screaming )

30:22.154 --> 30:23.610
(grunting)

30:25.074 --> 30:26.405
Get her.

30:29.620 --> 30:31.201
Get up!

30:41.298 --> 30:43.163
Guard the door.

30:52.685 --> 30:53.970
Yah!

30:58.858 --> 30:59.847
( screaming )

30:59.942 --> 31:01.773
Get your frelling hands off me!

31:01.861 --> 31:05.149
They took Chiana by force,
and you just let them?!

31:05.239 --> 31:08.447
l was unaware until it was
too late to prevent it.

31:08.534 --> 31:12.277
Recriminations can wait.
We must act.

31:12.371 --> 31:14.236
Are you ready?

31:14.331 --> 31:17.368
(frantic panting )

31:17.460 --> 31:21.169
As the doctor said,
save your strength.

31:21.255 --> 31:23.587
Oh... can't let them do this.

31:23.674 --> 31:25.210
It won't happen.
Iwon't let it happen.

31:25.301 --> 31:27.462
They can't do it without Chiana
and they won't find her.

31:27.553 --> 31:29.339
(Chiana screaming)

31:29.430 --> 31:30.340
Bring her.

31:30.431 --> 31:32.092
Prepare for the procedure.

31:32.183 --> 31:34.174
What the frell's going on?

31:34.268 --> 31:36.099
I'll sedate her.
-No!

31:36.187 --> 31:38.052
No! Stop!

31:38.147 --> 31:40.263
Stop! This is wrong.

31:40.357 --> 31:42.348
This patient has been drugged.

31:42.443 --> 31:43.603
She is weak.

31:43.694 --> 31:45.275
She may die from this procedure.

31:45.362 --> 31:46.818
I don't care.

31:46.906 --> 31:49.818
My only concern is for the
safety of the fetus.

31:49.909 --> 31:50.989
Trayso.

31:51.077 --> 31:52.692
Please. Please.

31:52.787 --> 31:54.323
Proceed.

31:55.247 --> 31:56.862
Hold still.

31:56.957 --> 31:59.164
(Aeryn groaning )

32:02.296 --> 32:05.208
( screaming )

32:14.266 --> 32:15.722
What are you giving her?

32:15.810 --> 32:17.050
Something to ease the pain.

32:17.144 --> 32:19.226
She doesn't needs
anaesthetizing.

32:19.313 --> 32:21.053
Give it to the Nebari
girl instead.

32:21.148 --> 32:23.480
No, I won't. This is the
patient who needs anethes...

32:23.567 --> 32:26.229
You're not going to cut...
Oh, oh!

32:28.489 --> 32:30.400
Chiana:
Get that thing frelling
away from me!

32:30.491 --> 32:32.197
( spits )

32:32.284 --> 32:35.276
Very strong. She'll make
an excellent host.

32:35.371 --> 32:36.451
She had better.

32:36.539 --> 32:39.076
If the fetus dies, so will
the both of you.

32:39.166 --> 32:40.702
(QUIPS)

32:40.793 --> 32:42.249
Karohm:
Captain Jenek.

32:42.336 --> 32:44.577
Captain Wentrask is in the
station commons.

32:44.672 --> 32:46.287
He demands an urgent word, sir.

32:46.382 --> 32:49.249
Does he? Very well.

32:52.847 --> 32:54.428
Ralnaht?

32:56.725 --> 32:59.307
Jenek:
What do you want, Wentrask?

33:02.815 --> 33:06.057
I require your cooperation.

33:06.152 --> 33:08.188
But you can't compel it.

33:08.279 --> 33:12.818
Jenek, I know that your prisoner
is the Peacekeeper Aeryn Sun

33:12.908 --> 33:16.116
and that you are taking her to
Katratzi for Minister Ahkna.

33:16.203 --> 33:19.411
I also know that if my mission
fails, your mission becomes
irrelevant,

33:19.498 --> 33:21.363
as do you.

33:22.168 --> 33:24.250
Continue.

33:28.465 --> 33:30.046
Karohm?

33:31.051 --> 33:33.667
( monitors beep slowly)

33:44.315 --> 33:46.681
(panel beeping)

33:46.775 --> 33:48.640
Step back.

33:50.321 --> 33:52.812
I... was just checking to
see if more medica...

33:52.907 --> 33:56.525
Someone's been downloading the
station codes and schematics.

33:56.619 --> 33:58.359
It had to be you.

33:59.205 --> 34:01.070
But I'm disappointed.

34:01.165 --> 34:02.701
You know this can't succeed.

34:02.791 --> 34:04.782
We'll kill them both and
the fetus as well.

34:04.877 --> 34:07.619
No choice but to try.

34:07.713 --> 34:09.169
What the hell is taking
solong?

34:09.256 --> 34:11.121
The lights should be
out by now.

34:11.217 --> 34:15.085
The procedure's success depends
upon the swift transfer
of the fetus.

34:15.179 --> 34:20.299
Therefore, we should open both
the subjects simultaneously.

34:21.352 --> 34:22.512
I'll go check it out.

34:22.603 --> 34:23.934
Right.

34:24.647 --> 34:27.229
Listen to me, Karohm.

34:27.316 --> 34:33.437
Two, possibly three, females
are being held against their
will on the Scarran freighter.

34:33.530 --> 34:35.441
Halt.

34:35.532 --> 34:37.614
Prepare to begin.

34:44.708 --> 34:47.199
They pose the Scarrans
no threat.

34:47.294 --> 34:51.037
Their imprisonment is
completely unjust.

34:54.218 --> 34:56.584
I believe you.

34:56.679 --> 34:58.260
Then will you help me?

34:58.347 --> 34:59.837
Of course not.

34:59.932 --> 35:01.342
I'm gonna lock you up.

35:01.433 --> 35:03.048
( hisses )

35:03.143 --> 35:04.849
How wrong was he?

35:04.937 --> 35:09.271
Okay, now can you do what you
said you were gonna do?

35:09.358 --> 35:13.977
Dr. Trayso, in my opinion, this
patient's body is overstressed.

35:14.071 --> 35:16.232
Therefore, the fetus will
be debilitated.

35:16.323 --> 35:18.780
I think we should let her
regain her equilibrium

35:18.867 --> 35:20.653
before we begin the procedure.
-We don't have time.

35:20.744 --> 35:24.953
What you fail to realize is
that Ahkna's only interest
in your prisoner

35:25.040 --> 35:28.157
is as a means to the possible
information that John Crichton
possesses.

35:28.252 --> 35:32.461
Now my Peacekeeper defector can
give you John Crichton himself.

35:33.716 --> 35:37.049
Now, which mission do you
think is more vital?

35:37.136 --> 35:39.343
(monitor beeps)
All right.

35:39.430 --> 35:44.470
That's unlocked the docking
ports on Moya, on your ship
and my Transport Pod.

35:44.560 --> 35:46.676
Now for the power grid.

35:46.770 --> 35:50.058
Ah! Are these the
security beacons?

35:50.733 --> 35:51.893
Yes.

35:51.984 --> 35:54.817
(engine roars)

35:58.240 --> 36:00.481
There are three lives here,
and I will not be responsible

36:00.576 --> 36:03.113
for the loss of three lives!
-Doctor Pralatong, I beg you.

36:03.704 --> 36:04.819
Showtime.

36:04.913 --> 36:06.289
(groaning)

36:06.373 --> 36:09.706
(alerts in various
alien languages)

36:17.134 --> 36:18.340
Karohm, what's going on?

36:18.427 --> 36:19.837
Stand here.

36:23.307 --> 36:24.262
Oh!

36:24.350 --> 36:25.305
Stop!

36:25.392 --> 36:27.223
I'll kill her.
I'll cut her throat.

36:27.311 --> 36:28.892
Noranti:
He wouldn't dare.

36:28.979 --> 36:30.970
If the baby dies, Jenek'll
burn him dead, so shoot!

36:31.065 --> 36:33.147
I'll do it. I'll kill her.

36:33.233 --> 36:34.973
Kalish are supposed to be smart.

36:36.904 --> 36:38.735
Who do you think I believe?

36:40.908 --> 36:42.944
All right.

36:43.035 --> 36:44.275
Shoot me.

36:46.830 --> 36:48.331
( screams )

36:51.168 --> 36:53.033
You should've killed him.

36:53.128 --> 36:55.460
My body count's already
too high.

36:57.633 --> 37:00.170
Noranti:
The release is over here.

37:00.677 --> 37:02.258
Ready?

37:06.350 --> 37:07.931
Do it.

37:08.685 --> 37:10.346
( groans )

37:10.437 --> 37:12.519
Check the ship.
-Yes, I must check mine.

37:12.606 --> 37:14.471
No. You stay here.

37:14.566 --> 37:18.229
(alerts in various
alien languages)

37:20.322 --> 37:22.028
( growls )

37:22.116 --> 37:23.196
Are you done?

37:23.283 --> 37:25.535
Almost. If I jam the docking
docking port controls

37:25.619 --> 37:28.702
then the freighter won't be able
to break free and follow us.

37:34.128 --> 37:35.618
(gasping)

37:39.299 --> 37:40.755
How'd you do that?

37:42.678 --> 37:44.339
It was nothing. I...

37:44.430 --> 37:47.718
I merely cross-coupled the
emergency bypass conduits.
Let's go.

37:47.808 --> 37:50.720
Quickly! Emergency power will
come on any microt!

37:52.855 --> 37:54.220
Stop!

37:55.107 --> 37:57.268
Drop the weapon.

37:57.985 --> 37:59.270
Turn off that light.

37:59.361 --> 38:00.726
Granny, do what he says.

38:01.613 --> 38:03.353
Back to our vessel.

38:03.449 --> 38:04.529
You work for the Scarran, right?

38:04.616 --> 38:07.153
Yes. Why?

38:07.244 --> 38:11.112
Security is tight for visitors,
so you shouldn't be carrying.

38:11.790 --> 38:13.451
Carrying what?

38:15.419 --> 38:17.284
( groans )

38:19.923 --> 38:21.504
Agun.

38:21.592 --> 38:22.923
D'Argo, please!

38:23.010 --> 38:24.546
Please help her.

38:28.307 --> 38:30.548
Ralnaht. Report.

38:32.394 --> 38:34.510
(growling)

38:40.319 --> 38:43.152
( growls )

38:43.238 --> 38:47.072
Chiana:
I'm fine. You can put me down,
at least for now.

38:47.159 --> 38:49.070
Pilot, what's our status?

38:49.161 --> 38:50.901
Moya is free of the
docking collar.

38:50.996 --> 38:52.657
Reactivate all
Starburst systems.

38:52.748 --> 38:53.533
Done.

39:01.590 --> 39:03.296
(grunting)

39:09.431 --> 39:11.888
Who are you and what is
your mission?

39:15.395 --> 39:18.387
( groans )

39:30.953 --> 39:33.114
Sikozu:
Pilot, any communication
from Scorpius?

39:33.205 --> 39:35.241
No. Nor is he responding
to the Comms.

39:35.332 --> 39:38.665
Lo'La and our Transport Pod
have also been released
from their ports.

39:38.752 --> 39:40.583
Okay, well bring them aboard
with the Docking Web.

39:40.671 --> 39:42.582
What about Scorpius?
-What about him?

39:42.673 --> 39:44.664
Well he might've been captured.
-Or killed.

39:44.758 --> 39:47.044
We can only wish. Pilot,
Starburst as soon as you can.

39:47.135 --> 39:48.545
Oh, no, no, no, no.
-We are leaving.

39:48.637 --> 39:50.673
Pilot:
Preparing for Starburst.

39:51.640 --> 39:54.097
Why doesn't she ever listen?

40:01.358 --> 40:02.347
( shudders )

40:02.442 --> 40:05.570
It's... it's all right.
Aeryn, it's all right.

40:08.031 --> 40:09.862
You're here.

40:13.954 --> 40:16.366
Is this real?

40:18.709 --> 40:20.370
It's real.

40:21.378 --> 40:23.164
You're on Moya.

40:26.800 --> 40:28.631
You're safe.

40:30.262 --> 40:32.298
What about the baby?

40:35.392 --> 40:37.178
The baby's fine.

40:42.232 --> 40:44.848
Everything's gonna be okay.

40:45.986 --> 40:47.772
Sleep.

40:53.952 --> 40:55.328
Stay.

41:20.395 --> 41:22.101
You don't look as bad.

41:22.189 --> 41:24.931
I'm fine, thanks for asking.

41:25.025 --> 41:26.606
You nearly killed me.

41:26.693 --> 41:28.069
No, I didn't.

41:28.153 --> 41:29.563
Oh.

41:30.822 --> 41:33.438
But I did kill others.

41:36.870 --> 41:42.160
By my actions, I have taken
innocent lives.

41:42.250 --> 41:44.582
Welcome to Moya.

41:46.963 --> 41:53.254
In my time as Dominar, some of
my actions resulted in the
deaths of the undeserving.

41:53.345 --> 41:59.011
Even when the cause is just,
it's a hard thing to accept.

42:02.187 --> 42:04.769
I must seek forgiveness...

42:04.856 --> 42:06.312
Mmm...

42:06.400 --> 42:08.766
...from the Divine Eternal.

42:08.860 --> 42:10.942
I can't help you there.

42:11.029 --> 42:15.193
But I can extend my forgiveness.

42:52.195 --> 42:53.446
No!

42:54.239 --> 42:56.901
(organ music plays)

43:00.996 --> 43:03.703
( coffin creaking )

43:07.461 --> 43:09.201
Harvey?

43:09.296 --> 43:10.456
You're not dead.

43:10.547 --> 43:12.208
Of course I'm not dead.

43:12.299 --> 43:16.338
(laughs):
I am the... undead.

43:16.428 --> 43:17.964
That's not funny.

43:18.054 --> 43:19.885
That son of a bitch said he
took you out of my head.

43:19.973 --> 43:26.139
( in Transylvanian accent)
Scorpius, he upgraded me
to Harvey 2.0.

43:26.229 --> 43:29.813
One of my many improvements:

43:29.900 --> 43:33.233
utter loyalty to Scorpius.

43:33.320 --> 43:36.187
That's not an improvement.
-Oh, but it is.

43:36.281 --> 43:38.522
His course is the correct. Why?

43:38.617 --> 43:42.360
Eliminate Scarran threat.

43:43.538 --> 43:46.154
You know I don't give a damn
about his agenda.

43:46.249 --> 43:49.241
You must go back for him.

43:49.336 --> 43:53.249
Go back to sleep before I drive
a stake through your heart.

43:53.340 --> 43:55.296
( muffled ):
He knows everything
you know, John!

43:55.383 --> 43:56.509
What did you say?

43:56.593 --> 43:59.551
I said "Scorpius knows
everything you know, John."

43:59.638 --> 44:02.846
What... did you say?!

44:02.933 --> 44:07.097
I said "Scorpius knows
everything you know."

44:09.523 --> 44:10.979
Meaning what?

44:11.066 --> 44:12.931
Another new feature.

44:13.026 --> 44:15.438
Scorpius can hear me.

44:15.529 --> 44:19.238
Well, I've been sharing the
contents of your head with him.

44:19.324 --> 44:23.237
Memories, thoughts, dreams.

44:23.328 --> 44:25.364
Wormhole technology.

44:25.455 --> 44:27.195
No, you're lying.

44:27.290 --> 44:30.157
And eventually, they will
torture the information
out of him,

44:30.252 --> 44:32.834
and everything they ever wanted
to know about wormholes
will be theirs,

44:32.921 --> 44:34.411
courtesy of John Crichton.

44:34.506 --> 44:36.371
Leave me alone!

44:37.300 --> 44:38.210
No!

44:38.301 --> 44:40.587
Hey... hey...

44:40.679 --> 44:42.761
It's all right.

44:42.848 --> 44:45.339
Harvey:
You have to go back
for Scorpius!

44:45.433 --> 44:46.559
Tell her, John. Tell her!

44:46.643 --> 44:50.386
You must rescue Scorpius.
Tell her!
