WEBVTT

00:00.560 --> 00:02.080
    Previously on St Elsewhere.

00:02.080 --> 00:03.560
We have to be Barbara's parents.

00:03.560 --> 00:06.560
It's the biggest
responsibility in the world.

00:06.560 --> 00:08.960
Bob's performing
       unnecessary surgery?

00:08.960 --> 00:10.040
           Not so loud.

00:10.040 --> 00:11.640
You think he's gonna listen to you?

00:11.640 --> 00:15.040
The surgeon he recruited personally
from Duke or the department clown?

00:15.040 --> 00:16.079
I can't believe it.

00:16.079 --> 00:19.000
The rotation I've been dreading is
turning into a dream.

00:19.000 --> 00:21.880
It's a disorder that
affects motor function.

00:21.880 --> 00:24.520
The paralysis moves in stages
from the feet.

00:24.520 --> 00:25.760
            I love you.

00:25.760 --> 00:29.760
I have to be on that next shuttle
because I'm going to walk with God.

02:09.360 --> 02:12.800
TERRIFIED SCREAMING

02:12.800 --> 02:16.800
   It's alright. You're alright.

02:16.920 --> 02:19.040
        It's only a dream.

02:19.040 --> 02:23.040
(SHE SOBS)

02:47.360 --> 02:51.360
Victor, do you want to
give me a hand over here?

02:54.760 --> 02:56.280
Mr Norton's leg.

02:56.280 --> 02:57.320
Nasty, what happened?

02:57.320 --> 02:59.120
Locked myself out,
        getting the paper,

02:59.120 --> 03:02.280
climbed in the window,
forgot it was closed.

03:02.280 --> 03:04.040
Using the old gluteus maximus.

03:04.040 --> 03:05.480
              Victor.

03:05.480 --> 03:08.160
Listen.
Can you cover for me tomorrow?

03:08.160 --> 03:10.680
Roxanne and I want to get out
of town ahead of the traffic.

03:10.680 --> 03:13.240
Love to but I can't.
Big handball tournament.

03:13.240 --> 03:16.200
The handball's regulation
size but the tournament is big.

03:16.200 --> 03:17.600
I'll help you out.

03:17.600 --> 03:18.920
   Oh really, what's the catch?

03:18.920 --> 03:21.320
No catch.
I'm an incurable romantic.

03:21.320 --> 03:23.280
The idea of you
     and Roxanne on vacation

03:23.280 --> 03:25.200
warms the sprockets of my projector.

03:25.200 --> 03:27.520
Make yourself useful,
      suture the other leg.

03:27.520 --> 03:30.280
  OK. 20 silk and some lidocaine.

03:30.280 --> 03:30.800
Where are you going?

03:30.800 --> 03:31.880
Where are you going?
          Atlantic City.

03:31.880 --> 03:33.480
Last I heard you were talking
  Barbados.

03:33.480 --> 03:35.360
Roxanne needs to
get out of the hospital,

03:35.360 --> 03:36.880
 she wants to do something tacky.

03:36.880 --> 03:39.920
Work in here isn't tacky enough?

03:39.920 --> 03:40.600
Aagh!

03:40.600 --> 03:41.720
Aagh!
Sorry.

03:41.720 --> 03:43.160
I'm not setting foot in Atlantic
 City

03:43.160 --> 03:44.640
until Bert Parks gets a fair
   hearing.

03:44.640 --> 03:47.600
So Roxanne wants to rule the bones
huh?

03:47.600 --> 03:49.920
She wants to try here hand
at the slide crap game,

03:49.920 --> 03:52.320
Black jack, anything where
there is an element of risk.

03:52.320 --> 03:56.320
You guys do use birth control?

03:56.360 --> 03:58.560
For the first time in my life,
I'm involved with a

03:58.560 --> 04:00.480
woman and not looking
for the escape clause.

04:00.480 --> 04:02.040
I envy you, pal.

04:02.040 --> 04:05.240
Let me give you some advice, one
man to another.

04:05.240 --> 04:07.160
Never draw to an inside straight,

04:07.160 --> 04:10.080
double down on 10 or 11,
stay away from the big 69.

04:10.080 --> 04:11.720
  I'll try and resist temptation.

04:11.720 --> 04:12.760
Agh!

04:12.760 --> 04:13.800
That hurt?

04:13.800 --> 04:15.760
Of course, you're
sticking a needle in me.

04:15.760 --> 04:19.760
Open the window next time.

04:19.880 --> 04:23.880
Sorry.

04:23.880 --> 04:27.080
Almost missed a step and he
catches in the first down.

04:27.080 --> 04:29.480
For crying out loud, what do
you think you're doing?

04:29.480 --> 04:31.240
Playing football,
what does it look like?

04:31.240 --> 04:32.320
Not here you're not.

04:32.320 --> 04:35.640
My mum is upstairs getting
a blood test, takes forever.

04:35.640 --> 04:36.840
          Wait a second.

04:36.840 --> 04:40.400
Goof around someplace else.
This is a hospital not a gridiron.

04:40.400 --> 04:44.400
Don't be a jerk, give me the ball.

04:44.920 --> 04:45.960
What's your name?

04:45.960 --> 04:47.000
What's it to you?

04:47.000 --> 04:48.800
Am I going to have to call security?

04:48.800 --> 04:49.840
            Josh Green.

04:49.840 --> 04:53.000
Not only are you a nuisance,
you are easily intimidated.

04:53.000 --> 04:55.480
This can be returned to Mrs Green

04:55.480 --> 04:58.320
and I want you two hooligans
to run a little play for me.

04:58.320 --> 05:01.520
Go long and keep going.

05:01.520 --> 05:04.880
Mark,
I need to talk to you about Victor.

05:04.880 --> 05:08.440
Beautiful drive to work this
morning, trees ablaze with colour,

05:08.440 --> 05:12.360
a chill in the air. You've just
cast a pall over my entire day.

05:12.360 --> 05:14.520
Can't it wait until later,
    I'm doing surgery.

05:14.520 --> 05:16.200
I want you to drop
him from my rotation.

05:16.200 --> 05:17.240
Make up your mind.

05:17.240 --> 05:19.840
It's the third time you've thrown
him out this year.

05:19.840 --> 05:22.000
He blew a blepharoplasty
     I had scheduled.

05:22.000 --> 05:23.960
Went behind my back
     and panicked the patient

05:23.960 --> 05:25.240
for not having the procedure.

05:25.240 --> 05:28.040
Sometimes Ehrlich doesn't have the
sense God gave chickens.

05:28.040 --> 05:29.240
I'll talk to him.

05:29.240 --> 05:33.240
Fine, because I can't
stomach him any more.

05:35.120 --> 05:37.320
Wait a minute.

05:37.320 --> 05:41.320
Now you're going along on the ride.

05:54.800 --> 05:56.640
    Starch your uniform today?

05:56.640 --> 06:00.160
Yes, the laundry screwed-up so I
feel like I'm wearing a flak jacket.

06:00.160 --> 06:02.960
Although round here
it might not be such a bad idea.

06:02.960 --> 06:06.200
It's a good look on you.
Crisp, clean.

06:06.200 --> 06:07.760
You're spoiling me, Bob.

06:07.760 --> 06:11.760
I don't get hellos from you and now
all of a sudden a compliment?

06:12.120 --> 06:16.120
 We should get together some time.

06:19.720 --> 06:21.880
That was my
first flight with Cochran.

06:21.880 --> 06:25.400
He stayed in orbit while the rest of
us went on down to lunar surface.

06:25.400 --> 06:27.080
I stood in line for
hours to get a look

06:27.080 --> 06:28.960
at the rocks you guys brought down.

06:28.960 --> 06:31.320
Most expensive
paperweights in history.

06:31.320 --> 06:32.840
Good luck, Jack.

06:32.840 --> 06:34.320
Thanks, Luther.

06:34.320 --> 06:35.920
   What's the story with Chuck?

06:35.920 --> 06:37.680
 Is this sickness all in his head.

06:37.680 --> 06:41.360
First I hear he can't move and
then a few days later he's OK.

06:41.360 --> 06:43.000
He has Guillain-Barre syndrome.

06:43.000 --> 06:44.840
You're going to ace it, Boomer.

06:44.840 --> 06:46.680
                Is he going to be OK?

06:46.680 --> 06:50.160
Eventually.
The disease is idiosyncratic.

06:50.160 --> 06:52.760
The patient's recovery from
paralysis can be as rapid as

06:52.760 --> 06:53.960
the onset of disease.

06:53.960 --> 06:57.280
Chronic active hepatitis is one
 of Auschlander's favourites.

06:57.280 --> 06:58.640
Odds are it will be on the test.

06:58.640 --> 06:59.800
Thanks for the tip.

06:59.800 --> 07:01.320
                            Big exam?

07:01.320 --> 07:04.320
Let's just say my future in
medicine hangs in the balance.

07:04.320 --> 07:05.480
Jack, one more thing.

07:05.480 --> 07:08.160
I remember that Auschlander
tries to sandbag people

07:08.160 --> 07:10.080
by putting the X-rays up backwards.

07:10.080 --> 07:13.600
           Sounds like flight school.

07:13.600 --> 07:16.360
Colonel Cochran is right
down here, would you excuse me?

07:16.360 --> 07:20.360
Just one minute, I have got
to run to the john.

07:35.360 --> 07:39.360
Morning, Mark.

07:44.560 --> 07:46.680
     What are you doing here?

07:46.680 --> 07:47.800
                       What happened?

07:47.800 --> 07:49.320
Nothing, everything is fine.

07:49.320 --> 07:53.320
Just the little one here, she got a
little lonely for another granddad.

07:59.280 --> 08:02.480
              Oh boy.

08:02.480 --> 08:04.080
          Did I miss you?

08:04.080 --> 08:08.080
Slept the whole way over.

08:17.680 --> 08:21.040
Has Mrs Cocotoni
been sent to surgery yet?

08:21.040 --> 08:24.800
Then don't. Varicose veins
can wait until tomorrow.

08:24.800 --> 08:27.200
Tell her I didn't like
the sound of her cough

08:27.200 --> 08:31.200
and I want to see
a chest X-ray first.

08:32.240 --> 08:33.280
          How is Yvonne?

08:33.280 --> 08:37.280
Making good progress.

08:38.280 --> 08:39.919
        She needs changing.

08:39.919 --> 08:43.919
         Do it right here.

08:54.480 --> 08:57.600
Last night at the hospital,
Yvonne looked right at me,

08:57.600 --> 09:00.160
eyes wide open,
    smiled for the first time.

09:00.160 --> 09:04.160
            That is very encouraging.

09:04.840 --> 09:08.680
Doctors told us not to get
too excited.

09:08.680 --> 09:12.680
Still, we have reason to hope
for continued improvement.

09:13.160 --> 09:17.160
There you go, sweetheart.
There's my little girl.

09:18.240 --> 09:22.240
                 All sweet and clean.

09:26.800 --> 09:27.840
            What is it?

09:27.840 --> 09:31.600
We're bringing Yvonne
home from hospital.

09:31.600 --> 09:35.040
We're going to have to bathe her,
feed her, exercise her muscles,

09:35.040 --> 09:37.440
a lot of work but
I think it's our only chance

09:37.440 --> 09:39.440
of getting our daughter back.

09:39.440 --> 09:42.960
I don't want Barbara short changed.

09:42.960 --> 09:46.200
Patty and me would like you
to take Barbara until Yvonne

09:46.200 --> 09:47.920
is well enough or whatever.

09:47.920 --> 09:49.640
           You mean it?

09:49.640 --> 09:50.880
That is if you don't mind.

09:50.880 --> 09:53.280
WAILS

09:53.280 --> 09:57.280
I find that
she likes to be held like this.

09:59.640 --> 10:03.320
            I see, OK.

10:03.320 --> 10:06.120
Patty says she's an upright baby.

10:06.120 --> 10:09.520
I'll come and see you soon.
Tell Patti not to worry,

10:09.520 --> 10:13.520
her granddaughter is in good hands.

10:17.560 --> 10:21.560
Goodbye little one.

10:27.360 --> 10:29.840
        You look like hell.

10:29.840 --> 10:32.360
All this way to give me grief, huh?

10:32.360 --> 10:35.440
Did Nasa send you up
here to talk to me?

10:35.440 --> 10:37.880
    I was in the neighbourhood.

10:37.880 --> 10:41.440
It is not like Boston is halfway
between Houston and Cape Canaveral.

10:41.440 --> 10:45.440
I saw you on the tube the other
night, going on about resurrection.

10:47.360 --> 10:49.200
             I'm fine.

10:49.200 --> 10:51.000
              Really.

10:51.000 --> 10:54.200
Getting sick was the best
thing that ever happened to me.

10:54.200 --> 10:58.200
God didn't want to hurt me,
he just wanted to teach me.

10:58.560 --> 11:01.640
     I am completely paralysed

11:01.640 --> 11:04.240
           but my mind,

11:04.240 --> 11:08.240
my mind
was in a state of perfect clarity.

11:08.320 --> 11:11.200
When the strength began to
flow back into my body again,

11:11.200 --> 11:13.960
it wasn't human strength any more,

11:13.960 --> 11:17.960
      the power of the Lord.

11:18.840 --> 11:21.640
New crew assignments
for the shuttle came out.

11:21.640 --> 11:25.520
They pulled you from
the flight roster.

11:25.520 --> 11:29.200
They put you on an
extended medical furlough.

11:29.200 --> 11:31.480
  I'm never going up again, am I?

11:31.480 --> 11:34.960
A lot of people aren't too keen
 about putting a holy roller

11:34.960 --> 11:37.680
up into the firmament.

11:37.680 --> 11:41.680
I rarely get the news from you or
one of those administrative types.

11:42.280 --> 11:45.040
I am really sorry it
had to come from me.

11:45.040 --> 11:47.960
If anyone can understand what
I have experienced, it's you.

11:47.960 --> 11:50.600
You remember the first time we
stepped out of that shuttle?

11:50.600 --> 11:54.600
There it was, the whole
damn universe.

11:57.040 --> 12:00.400
Everything come out OK?

12:00.400 --> 12:03.560
You ready to go back upstairs?

12:03.560 --> 12:05.720
Yes, get this guy your
autograph would you?

12:05.720 --> 12:09.440
No.

12:09.440 --> 12:13.440
It is for my son, actually.

12:14.240 --> 12:16.480
Hang on to that, it
is worth something.

12:16.480 --> 12:19.480
Two Hank Clayburns
would get you one Allen Sheppard.

12:19.480 --> 12:22.440
          See you around.

12:22.440 --> 12:26.440
Thank you.

12:32.040 --> 12:36.040
Hello, Mrs Craig, lovely
outfit you're wearing.

12:50.200 --> 12:54.200
Hey there, Barbara.

13:03.800 --> 13:07.800
There you go.

13:10.720 --> 13:14.720
Oh Mark, thank you.

13:16.880 --> 13:20.880
Three days post-op, CAH,
VSL for endometriosis.

13:21.120 --> 13:24.320
She is tolerating a normal
diet but is still having

13:24.320 --> 13:27.400
         incisional pain.

13:27.400 --> 13:30.560
          Any questions?

13:30.560 --> 13:34.560
         Goodbye. Andiamo.

13:36.520 --> 13:39.200
The way I figure,
if we go straight through,

13:39.200 --> 13:41.200
we could hit in six hours.

13:41.200 --> 13:43.480
Bingo.

13:43.480 --> 13:47.480
Chandler, my ex-husband is arriving
from Mississippi this afternoon.

13:47.720 --> 13:50.600
What? So our vacation is off?

13:50.600 --> 13:52.680
      Postponed.  Until when?

13:52.680 --> 13:53.960
      Just a couple of days.

13:53.960 --> 13:55.680
But we only get a week off.

13:55.680 --> 13:56.840
   Can we talk about this later?

13:56.840 --> 13:59.080
No, we'll talk about this now.

13:59.080 --> 14:01.880
    That will be all for today.

14:01.880 --> 14:04.920
This is a fine time to tell me.

14:04.920 --> 14:05.960
         I just found out.

14:05.960 --> 14:08.120
I thought you and
your ex were history.

14:08.120 --> 14:10.000
            For years.

14:10.000 --> 14:12.040
Why don't you go on
ahead and I'll catch up

14:12.040 --> 14:14.120
   with you in a couple of days.

14:14.120 --> 14:16.720
The car is packed,
hotel reservations

14:16.720 --> 14:19.840
confirmed, I moved heaven and earth
to get Diana Ross tickets and

14:19.840 --> 14:22.280
now all bets are off because
your ex drops out of the sky.

14:22.280 --> 14:24.400
      I have to talk to him.

14:24.400 --> 14:28.400
It must be important if he made
the trek out of Mississippi.

14:30.480 --> 14:32.240
I don't get it.

14:32.240 --> 14:36.240
Maybe I'm missing
something here, right?

14:44.680 --> 14:47.520
Did you or did you not
      counsel a patient

14:47.520 --> 14:49.720
against the advice of the attending?

14:49.720 --> 14:52.520
OK, Dr Craig, what
happened exactly was...

14:52.520 --> 14:54.760
I didn't ask for an essay,
yes or no?

14:54.760 --> 14:56.000
             Yes sir.

14:56.000 --> 14:59.600
Even if I agreed with your
assessment, which I don't,

14:59.600 --> 15:01.640
you're off the rotation.

15:01.640 --> 15:05.480
What you did was misconduct and
showed extremely poor judgment.

15:05.480 --> 15:08.120
I didn't know what else to do,
I was in a no-win situation.

15:08.120 --> 15:11.440
I'm torn between my responsibilities
to a patient and following orders.

15:11.440 --> 15:12.520
You could have come to me.

15:12.520 --> 15:14.360
I didn't want to go
over Dr Caldwell's head.

15:14.360 --> 15:16.680
So you went behind his back?

15:16.680 --> 15:19.400
I ought to blow you
out of this hospital.

15:19.400 --> 15:21.400
But you're lucky,
I'm in a very good mood today.

15:21.400 --> 15:24.520
Oh that's right, the baby,
congratulations, let me say,

15:24.520 --> 15:26.800
someone who has always
looked up to you as a father.

15:26.800 --> 15:27.840
       Don't push your luck.

15:27.840 --> 15:29.240
Yes sir.

15:29.240 --> 15:32.560
  I'm transferring you to OBGYN.

15:32.560 --> 15:34.120
I'll apologise to Dr Caldwell

15:34.120 --> 15:36.840
immediately, this will never
happen again cross my heart.

15:36.840 --> 15:40.040
    You start tomorrow morning.

15:40.040 --> 15:42.480
Believe me,
I am not cut out for OBGYN.

15:42.480 --> 15:45.080
Women find me rude, vulgar,
   lacking sensitivity.

15:45.080 --> 15:46.800
Would you send your granddaughter

15:46.800 --> 15:49.800
to me for sex counselling?
When she's older, that is.

15:49.800 --> 15:53.800
OBGYN is a speciality where the
one-to-one relationship between

15:54.360 --> 15:57.520
doctor and patient is
extremely important.

15:57.520 --> 15:59.640
 By sending you there, my hope is

15:59.640 --> 16:03.640
you will develop some
interpersonal skills.

16:04.000 --> 16:06.720
But being a surgeon is the only
thing that matters to me, sir.

16:06.720 --> 16:10.720
Good luck, Ehrlich,
and get out of here.

16:21.560 --> 16:25.320
She said she wouldn't go out with
me unless her room-mate came along.

16:25.320 --> 16:29.320
I don't double date, I always get
ones with personality and cellulite.

16:29.720 --> 16:32.120
By the time I get
through this exam, I will be

16:32.120 --> 16:34.360
too wasted to hold
up my end of the conversation.

16:34.360 --> 16:36.800
When did you ever hold up
your end of the conversation?

16:36.800 --> 16:38.360
If you need a fourth, I'll go along.

16:38.360 --> 16:40.640
Thanks but I was looking
forward to a nice evening

16:40.640 --> 16:43.800
of cuisine, intelligent wine, faced
tartare will put her off her food.

16:43.800 --> 16:46.040
     The scar's not that bad.

16:46.040 --> 16:50.040
Hi Wayne, Bloomer.

16:51.240 --> 16:53.680
See what I mean.
And Ehrlich's a surgeon.

16:53.680 --> 16:54.840
          Was a surgeon.

16:54.840 --> 16:56.880
I'm blanking.

16:56.880 --> 16:59.760
Do either of you know the products
of the islets of Langerhans?

16:59.760 --> 17:02.200
Bananas, monkey pot, ashtrays.

17:02.200 --> 17:04.720
Do you mind?
This question could be on the test.

17:04.720 --> 17:08.359
Individual microscopic structures
scattered through the pancreas.

17:08.359 --> 17:09.800
  Three different kinds of cells.

17:09.800 --> 17:11.400
        Alfa, beta, delta,

17:11.400 --> 17:15.000
       glucagon and insulin.

17:15.000 --> 17:17.960
Guy asks a question, doesn't
even stick around for the answer.

17:17.960 --> 17:20.040
Green apple two step,
      fifth time today.

17:20.040 --> 17:24.040
He's completely freaked out about
this exam.

17:24.400 --> 17:28.400
I don't blame him.
Drops a bomb this time, he's out.

17:29.400 --> 17:31.880
     All kidding aside, Wayne,

17:31.880 --> 17:33.880
       how bad does it look?

17:33.880 --> 17:35.640
Healing well.

17:35.640 --> 17:38.280
Less red than it used to be.

17:38.280 --> 17:42.280
Looks like the confluence of the
Mississippi and the Missouri

17:43.240 --> 17:47.240
which would put St Louis
     right about there.

18:02.960 --> 18:04.000
         Can you make it?

18:04.000 --> 18:08.000
I don't need any help.

18:14.600 --> 18:16.680
How about a back rub?
You'll feel better.

18:16.680 --> 18:18.080
No.

18:18.080 --> 18:20.200
Honey, everything is going to be OK.

18:20.200 --> 18:21.640
  You can get a job in aerospace,

18:21.640 --> 18:23.640
make twice as much
money as you are making.

18:23.640 --> 18:26.240
None of that's important.

18:26.240 --> 18:29.840
I have to
get back up there to walk with them.

18:29.840 --> 18:32.200
NASA's refusing to send me,
so that must mean God wants

18:32.200 --> 18:36.200
me to seek a better way.

18:37.280 --> 18:40.040
God so loved the world he
gave his only begotten son.

18:40.040 --> 18:44.040
       Chuck, I'm your wife,

18:44.640 --> 18:47.200
        I'm trying to help,

18:47.200 --> 18:51.200
but you're completely shutting me
out with all this religious nonsense.

18:51.320 --> 18:54.280
You don't understand the rapture.

18:54.280 --> 18:56.800
No one does. I'm totally alone.

18:56.800 --> 18:59.640
 You're bringing that on yourself.

18:59.640 --> 19:03.040
I felt closer to you when you were
out of radio contact on the other

19:03.040 --> 19:04.720
         side of the moon.

19:04.720 --> 19:06.240
I have to give up everything

19:06.240 --> 19:08.840
to achieve everything,
it's a lesson I must learn.

19:08.840 --> 19:11.280
       And nothing matters.

19:11.280 --> 19:13.280
         Not our marriage,

19:13.280 --> 19:15.880
         not the children.

19:15.880 --> 19:17.560
    You'd throw all that away?

19:17.560 --> 19:20.880
Whatever it takes to be with him.

19:20.880 --> 19:24.880
     I'm going back to Texas.

19:27.040 --> 19:31.040
May the Lord be with you.

19:34.280 --> 19:36.480
I called Dr Barton
but he's in surgery.

19:36.480 --> 19:38.920
  Dr Hawkin's caught in traffic.

19:38.920 --> 19:41.720
It's alright, what's the problem?

19:41.720 --> 19:45.720
Male, 30s, urinary frequency with
TVA tendencies.

19:45.880 --> 19:47.640
Fever?  103.

19:47.640 --> 19:49.160
What's your assessment?

19:49.160 --> 19:53.160
I'm worried about structural
abnormalities, maybe a tumour.

19:54.360 --> 19:55.600
Any indication?

19:55.600 --> 19:58.840
The patient's catexic, I'd say
he's lost maybe 40 lbs.

19:58.840 --> 19:59.880
What's his name?

19:59.880 --> 20:00.920
            Mr Zapeta.

20:00.920 --> 20:02.520
Mr Zapeta.

20:02.520 --> 20:05.680
I'm Dr Westphall. Dr Fiscus has
 asked me to take a look at you.

20:05.680 --> 20:09.000
I don't need another doctor, I
just need something for the pain.

20:09.000 --> 20:11.040
First we have to find out what's
wrong.

20:11.040 --> 20:12.960
Will you take your shirt off
   please?

20:12.960 --> 20:15.280
PHONE RINGS

20:15.280 --> 20:16.320
You have a phone call.

20:16.320 --> 20:17.360
         Not now, Luther.

20:17.360 --> 20:18.760
I think you'd better take this one.

20:18.760 --> 20:21.920
Dr Fiscus is with a patient, Luther.

20:21.920 --> 20:25.920
INAUDIBLE

20:26.280 --> 20:28.560
Go ahead, you've already
interrupted the exam.

20:28.560 --> 20:30.520
It's Mona.

20:30.520 --> 20:33.040
Something about the results.

20:33.040 --> 20:34.720
Sounds like good news.

20:34.720 --> 20:37.880
       I'll call her later.

20:37.880 --> 20:41.000
Tenderness around the bladder.

20:41.000 --> 20:42.720
Mr Zapeta, I'd like to admit you.

20:42.720 --> 20:44.720
I can't stay.

20:44.720 --> 20:47.920
Just give me something
so it doesn't hurt.

20:47.920 --> 20:50.080
I got to pee real bad.

20:50.080 --> 20:53.040
Nurse, can we get a dock over here.

20:53.040 --> 20:56.800
You have a very high fever and
you are in a great deal of pain.

20:56.800 --> 20:57.840
I'll be OK.

20:57.840 --> 21:00.000
It's likely you have an
     infection of some sort

21:00.000 --> 21:02.360
and unless we take tests,
we won't be able to treat it.

21:02.360 --> 21:05.600
Doctor, I don't have the kind of
a job where I can take a couple

21:05.600 --> 21:07.640
of days off and still get paid.

21:07.640 --> 21:11.640
If I'm not there, the loading dock,
they'll find someone else.

21:11.680 --> 21:15.680
           Here you go.

21:19.200 --> 21:21.680
Muscle-wasting around the eyes.

21:21.680 --> 21:24.520
I don't like treating him
    as an out-patient

21:24.520 --> 21:26.480
but he isn't giving
      us much choice, is he?

21:26.480 --> 21:27.560
Doctor?

21:27.560 --> 21:31.280
CRASHING

21:31.280 --> 21:32.480
        Pulse 45, regular.

21:32.480 --> 21:35.280
Let's get a line, put him on
a monitor, come on people,

21:35.280 --> 21:39.240
I need some help here.

21:39.240 --> 21:42.800
Just because your period is one
day late does not make you pregnant.

21:42.800 --> 21:44.280
I know, but humour me, OK.

21:44.280 --> 21:46.640
   OK, we'll draw blood and see.

21:46.640 --> 21:47.800
Hey, Dr Chandler.  Hello.

21:47.800 --> 21:50.920
I've got a feeling Ken and I are
going to get some good news today.

21:50.920 --> 21:52.800
I'm glad somebody around here is.

21:52.800 --> 21:56.800
I'm on my way to check the slides
for Mrs Kilmartin's cervical biopsy.

21:56.800 --> 21:58.640
What's bothering him?

21:58.640 --> 22:00.280
           A long story.

22:00.280 --> 22:04.280
Obviously,
   and without a happy ending.

22:15.440 --> 22:17.520
Can you tell me where I
can find Roxanne Turner?

22:17.520 --> 22:21.520
Down the hall to the left.

22:29.320 --> 22:33.320
Are Mrs Ferguson's platelet counts
back from the lab yet?

22:33.560 --> 22:36.960
That's right. Thanks, bye.

22:36.960 --> 22:39.680
Normal.
I'll need a biopsy tray.

22:39.680 --> 22:41.760
I'll have to send down a
central supply for one.

22:41.760 --> 22:43.040
      How long will that be?

22:43.040 --> 22:45.360
With any luck you should
have one by lunchtime.

22:45.360 --> 22:48.280
I'll run down and get
that for you, save time.

22:48.280 --> 22:49.920
   Thanks, I'll stop back later.

22:49.920 --> 22:52.960
You don't go
anywhere until I get that bed count.

22:52.960 --> 22:55.040
I finished that hours ago.

22:55.040 --> 22:59.040
Watch the phones for me. Please.

23:02.080 --> 23:04.760
OK, Bob.
The first time was an accident.

23:04.760 --> 23:06.760
Why don't you go
paw somebody else, all right?

23:06.760 --> 23:10.760
Sorry.

23:14.200 --> 23:18.200
           She's not in.

23:20.360 --> 23:22.960
Do you mind if I wait here?

23:22.960 --> 23:26.960
        Sure, have a seat.

23:33.040 --> 23:35.240
      Do you know Dr Turner?

23:35.240 --> 23:39.240
I wouldn't be waiting unless I did.

23:39.520 --> 23:41.600
You're her ex-husband, aren't you?

23:41.600 --> 23:43.960
Andrew Turner.

23:43.960 --> 23:47.960
          Phil Chandler.

23:49.640 --> 23:53.000
First time in Boston.

23:53.000 --> 23:55.040
Always smell like this?

23:55.040 --> 23:57.320
                No.

23:57.320 --> 24:00.440
That's the trouble with cities.

24:00.440 --> 24:04.440
Smell like somebody that
turned over an out house.

24:04.760 --> 24:06.600
Cigarette?

24:06.600 --> 24:08.640
No, it's no smoking in the hospital.

24:08.640 --> 24:10.200
That's OK.

24:10.200 --> 24:14.200
I like rolling them more than
I do firing them up anyway.

24:14.520 --> 24:17.720
Went to Montgomery once,
stayed there six months.

24:17.720 --> 24:19.240
       What were you doing?

24:19.240 --> 24:20.840
Six months.

24:20.840 --> 24:23.280
So the judge say.

24:23.280 --> 24:27.280
Folks demonstrated for their rights,
seemed fair to me.

24:28.200 --> 24:32.200
To let policemen be the tattoo on
my forehead, split it wide open.

24:32.840 --> 24:34.800
     That's when you met her?

24:34.800 --> 24:38.800
No. Roxanne grew up in
Blue Creek Forge, same as me.

24:40.560 --> 24:41.920
First time I met her I knew.

24:41.920 --> 24:42.960
        That you loved her?

24:42.960 --> 24:46.960
No, that she had a fire for
   learning.

24:47.600 --> 24:51.080
Roxanne was the first person in
Blue Creek Forge to go to college.

24:51.080 --> 24:54.560
I was real proud of her,
the whole town was.

24:54.560 --> 24:57.360
   She's an extraordinary woman.

24:57.360 --> 24:59.280
You sleeping with her?

24:59.280 --> 25:00.480
            Well, I...

25:00.480 --> 25:04.480
I thought so.

25:05.280 --> 25:06.800
Andrew!

25:06.800 --> 25:10.800
Hello, darling.

25:10.800 --> 25:12.720
Andrew.

25:12.720 --> 25:16.720
Yes, ma'am.

25:19.920 --> 25:22.440
Daniel! Here's the liver biopsy tray
you wanted.

25:22.440 --> 25:24.280
I brought up some extras
     to have on hand.

25:24.280 --> 25:25.360
         Thank you, Helen.

25:25.360 --> 25:27.120
Things tend to get crazy around here

25:27.120 --> 25:30.640
so if you ever need anything,
 come to me, I'll get it for you.

25:30.640 --> 25:32.080
       I'm glad you're back.

25:32.080 --> 25:33.160
Me too.

25:33.160 --> 25:35.560
Send those trays back
down to central supply.

25:35.560 --> 25:38.640
I thought we should have some
up here so we have some on hand.

25:38.640 --> 25:41.120
You wanna sling the bull
at Auschlander, fine,

25:41.120 --> 25:42.640
but that crud doesn't wash with me.

25:42.640 --> 25:46.120
Lucy, I'm really only trying to help
you run things more efficiently.

25:46.120 --> 25:47.360
Talk about efficiency.

25:47.360 --> 25:48.720
This floor has had the highest

25:48.720 --> 25:51.120
efficiency rating in the
hospital since I took over.

25:51.120 --> 25:53.440
Remember that next time
you suck up to Auschlander.

25:53.440 --> 25:57.440
If you want to get into this,
let's do it in private.

26:01.880 --> 26:03.400
When you transferred back up from ER

26:03.400 --> 26:06.120
you said there wouldn't be any
problem with me being the boss.

26:06.120 --> 26:09.080
That's true.
But I didn't realise morale around

26:09.080 --> 26:11.600
here had gone into the dumper. Do
you know what you are?

26:11.600 --> 26:13.160
An autocratic, ill-tempered...

26:13.160 --> 26:14.200
And you're a mess.

26:14.200 --> 26:16.840
Dragging your personal
problems into this hospital.

26:16.840 --> 26:18.560
One rotten marriage after another,

26:18.560 --> 26:21.800
your menopausal mood swings, those
bratty kids calling on the phone...

26:21.800 --> 26:25.800
Oooow!

26:44.600 --> 26:46.600
  You're in a chipper mood today.

26:46.600 --> 26:49.600
You're looking at one
very happy grandfather.

26:49.600 --> 26:52.960
They've entrusted Barbara
to our care. How about that?

26:52.960 --> 26:56.320
That's wonderful news.
Congratulations. Can I buy you lunch?

26:56.320 --> 26:58.960
No thanks.
I've got to get back to the OR.

26:58.960 --> 27:02.760
This is the first chance I've
had to wax my skis all morning.

27:02.760 --> 27:04.840
Ellen must be
thrilled about the child.

27:04.840 --> 27:06.520
You can say that again.

27:06.520 --> 27:09.480
She came by the
hospital an hour ago.

27:09.480 --> 27:13.480
Picked up Barbara.

27:13.480 --> 27:16.040
I suppose you've got to
heft out for the baby's room.

27:16.040 --> 27:20.000
High chair, crib, the works.

27:20.000 --> 27:22.480
This kid
is going to be better equipped than

27:22.480 --> 27:26.240
those marines we sent into Grenada.

27:26.240 --> 27:29.320
Catherine and I have a playpen
in the attic left over from our

27:29.320 --> 27:31.400
child-rearing days.
You're welcome to it.

27:31.400 --> 27:32.680
The kind with the wooden bars?

27:32.680 --> 27:34.880
         Yeah.  Forget it.

27:34.880 --> 27:38.040
If the baby got her head caught
in those slats, it's all over.

27:38.040 --> 27:40.040
Nylon mesh is the only way to go.

27:40.040 --> 27:42.040
  All set for the remedial, Jack?

27:42.040 --> 27:46.040
Yeah. Slight case of nerves but
ready as I'll ever be.

27:47.160 --> 27:51.160
Morrison, have you ever thought
about seeing a gastroenterologist?

27:58.240 --> 28:00.280
          Feeling better?

28:00.280 --> 28:02.400
Yeah. When do I get out of here?

28:02.400 --> 28:05.200
        Not for a few days.

28:05.200 --> 28:06.520
       I'm Doctor Westphall.

28:06.520 --> 28:08.080
My sister, Morena.

28:08.080 --> 28:09.280
              Hello.

28:09.280 --> 28:12.160
Your test results show
a kidney infection.

28:12.160 --> 28:16.000
The antibiotics
should knock it down all right.

28:16.000 --> 28:18.680
THEY EXCHANGE IN SPANISH

28:18.680 --> 28:22.080
She doesn't speak much English.
Just got here from El Salvador.

28:22.080 --> 28:24.920
   I also did some blood tests.

28:24.920 --> 28:28.920
Leave it.
I might feel like eating later on.

28:28.960 --> 28:32.520
Believe me, the food in this place
doesn't get any better

28:32.520 --> 28:33.840
even if you let it age.

28:33.840 --> 28:37.840
We can learn a lot about your overall
condition by looking at your blood.

28:37.840 --> 28:40.880
Yours is a low in nutrients
and there aren't as many red

28:40.880 --> 28:43.000
     cells as they should be.

28:43.000 --> 28:44.280
       Do you drink alcohol?

28:44.280 --> 28:46.680
A couple of beers after work, maybe.

28:46.680 --> 28:48.440
What about your diet, well balanced?

28:48.440 --> 28:51.120
Yeah. I guess.

28:51.120 --> 28:53.560
What did you have
for dinner last night?

28:53.560 --> 28:54.600
You ask a lot of questions.

28:54.600 --> 28:57.480
To find what's wrong,
so you don't get another infection.

28:57.480 --> 29:00.480
I had leftovers.

29:00.480 --> 29:04.040
Why don't you take this
thing off and

29:04.040 --> 29:06.200
give me some pills.
I've got to get back to work.

29:06.200 --> 29:10.120
You're suffering from malnutrition.
The food and vitamins you're getting

29:10.120 --> 29:12.400
here are a start, but unless
you eat properly...

29:12.400 --> 29:13.840
The kids eat first.

29:13.840 --> 29:16.080
If there's

29:16.080 --> 29:19.000
anything left...

29:19.000 --> 29:21.280
I dig in.

29:21.280 --> 29:25.280
When was the last
time you had a meal?

29:25.400 --> 29:27.760
This stupid hospital.

29:27.760 --> 29:29.440
Getting a lousy test result back

29:29.440 --> 29:32.920
from haematology is like trying
to renovate the Statue of Liberty.

29:32.920 --> 29:36.400
I've got Terri Valere breathing
down my neck. What you got?

29:36.400 --> 29:39.880
A 32-year-old female,
six weeks pregnant.

29:39.880 --> 29:42.920
She's been complaining of cramps and
bleeding.

29:42.920 --> 29:44.560
Where is the patient now?

29:44.560 --> 29:48.560
            Down in ER.

29:51.960 --> 29:54.560
   Your husband is quite a guy.

29:54.560 --> 29:57.640
I wouldn't be standing here
today if it wasn't for him.

29:57.640 --> 30:00.680
He insisted I get an education.

30:00.680 --> 30:03.440
Make the best of my abilities.

30:03.440 --> 30:06.400
He got me curious
about the outside world,

30:06.400 --> 30:10.400
even though he knew as soon as I
got a taste of it, I'd leave him.

30:12.920 --> 30:16.920
Well, it's... OK about our vacation.

30:20.920 --> 30:24.920
If you guys want to spend a few
days together, I'll understand.

30:31.480 --> 30:34.040
She's got an ectopic
pregnancy on the other side.

30:34.040 --> 30:38.040
Let's schedule her
surgery right away.

30:43.800 --> 30:46.600
Chandler, Dr Tanaflor,
    the man who delivered me,

30:46.600 --> 30:50.600
hell, he delivered all of us, he
died two weeks ago.

30:53.600 --> 30:57.600
That's why Andrew came. The town
doesn't have a doctor any more.

30:57.680 --> 31:01.680
The people are poor,
black and uneducated.

31:01.920 --> 31:03.840
Left to themselves, they'll treat

31:03.840 --> 31:07.400
an infection with a poultice
of raccoon blood and herbs.

31:07.400 --> 31:10.680
I'm going.

31:10.680 --> 31:14.680
I'm going back home.

31:15.400 --> 31:19.400
I'll meet you in OR.

31:20.400 --> 31:22.840
This completes the written
part of the examination.

31:22.840 --> 31:24.880
    Let's get on with the oral.

31:24.880 --> 31:28.360
Describe the stages
of Hodgkin's lymphoma.

31:28.360 --> 31:32.360
Stage one
is limited to a single node region.

31:32.800 --> 31:35.400
Stage two is typified by the

31:35.400 --> 31:39.400
involvement of two or more regions
on the same side of the diaphragm.

31:39.480 --> 31:42.960
Stage three involves both
sides of the diaphragm.

31:42.960 --> 31:46.960
Stage four...

31:48.840 --> 31:52.120
..is characterised

31:52.120 --> 31:56.120
by diffuse or disseminated disease
involving extra lymphatic tissue.

31:58.320 --> 32:01.000
             Correct.

32:01.000 --> 32:05.000
    Please interpret this film.

32:19.560 --> 32:23.400
There's got to be
a pen in here somewhere.

32:23.400 --> 32:25.520
Would you look at this junk?

32:25.520 --> 32:27.600
How can people
be so irresponsible and just

32:27.600 --> 32:31.600
toss their trash willy-nilly?

32:33.640 --> 32:34.680
Hey, that's my clip.

32:34.680 --> 32:36.560
Tie clip.

32:36.560 --> 32:38.520
 You want to get married, Fiscus?

32:38.520 --> 32:42.520
Phil, you're a nice guy but I don't
think it would work out between us.

32:42.800 --> 32:43.840
           I'm serious.

32:43.840 --> 32:47.840
I can tell because you
sucked in your extra chin.

32:50.400 --> 32:52.800
I'm losing Roxanne and I
don't know what to do about it.

32:52.800 --> 32:53.960
Another guy?

32:53.960 --> 32:57.720
    No, to guilt, to her past.

32:57.720 --> 33:01.360
I've never been good
at relationships.

33:01.360 --> 33:04.560
I get scared, nervous,
I keep the lid on.

33:04.560 --> 33:07.960
I usually don't show much of anything
but I thought she understood.

33:07.960 --> 33:10.960
I've been planning this
vacation, every detail.

33:10.960 --> 33:14.200
It was my way of saying I love you.

33:14.200 --> 33:16.840
There's a much simpler way
of putting the point across

33:16.840 --> 33:18.960
with no mixed signals.

33:18.960 --> 33:21.480
You take her by the shoulders,

33:21.480 --> 33:25.480
you look her in the eye and say,
I love you.

33:31.920 --> 33:35.920
Hey, er...

33:40.640 --> 33:44.640
I suppose you're here to make it
all better with some lame apology.

33:45.440 --> 33:47.880
Look...

33:47.880 --> 33:49.960
I know there's a lot
of animosity between us.

33:49.960 --> 33:53.960
Oh, you have a remarkable
grasp of the obvious, Helen.

33:54.400 --> 33:57.560
Lucy, I had no right to hit you.

33:57.560 --> 34:01.560
I'm really very sorry.

34:01.800 --> 34:04.280
If you want to take me up
before the review board...

34:04.280 --> 34:06.640
And watch you get off
with a slap on the wrist?

34:06.640 --> 34:10.639
Uh-uh. I'm calling a lawyer.

34:10.880 --> 34:12.480
You'll be collecting aluminium cans

34:12.480 --> 34:15.840
to support yourself
by the time I'm through!

34:15.840 --> 34:19.840
     # Fight on, Pennsylvania

34:20.159 --> 34:24.159
  # Take the ball across the line

34:24.840 --> 34:27.440
    # Fight, you Pennsylvanians

34:27.440 --> 34:31.440
# There it goes across this time... #

34:31.679 --> 34:35.679
Ellen, you
almost let the pan boil dry.

34:35.880 --> 34:39.800
Just a minute, babe.
Not too hot, not too cold.

34:39.800 --> 34:43.600
            Just right.

34:43.600 --> 34:47.600
By the way, our tickets for the
Boston Pops  came in the mail today.

34:47.600 --> 34:50.000
Do you want to give them
to one of your residents?

34:50.000 --> 34:52.560
Why would I want to give
tickets in the orchestra away?

34:52.560 --> 34:53.679
Because we can't go.

34:53.679 --> 34:55.440
             Why not?

34:55.440 --> 34:57.720
We have to stay with the baby.

34:57.720 --> 35:00.760
I didn't think of that.
Don't they still have sitters?

35:00.760 --> 35:03.360
    It's an all Gershwin night.

35:03.360 --> 35:05.880
They didn't give us
Barbara in order to

35:05.880 --> 35:09.520
keep her with a complete stranger.

35:09.520 --> 35:13.520
They're nice people but I'm sure they
don't know who George Gershwin is.

35:14.360 --> 35:18.360
Mark, do what you want to, but I'm
staying with our granddaughter.

35:19.320 --> 35:21.720
      Easy on the scallions.

35:21.720 --> 35:23.960
   How long are we grounded for?

35:23.960 --> 35:27.960
I thought you were looking forward
to having Barbara live with us.

35:28.160 --> 35:29.840
           I'm thrilled.

35:29.840 --> 35:33.080
But I don't see why our life
has to come to a standstill.

35:33.080 --> 35:35.960
What about our season tickets
to the metropolitan centre?

35:35.960 --> 35:38.680
Instead of watching the ballet,
wouldn't you rather watch

35:38.680 --> 35:42.680
Barbara take her first steps?

35:45.560 --> 35:49.040
This little thing has turned
the clock back 30 years.

35:49.040 --> 35:50.760
    Do you know how many nights

35:50.760 --> 35:54.280
I sat in this kitchen
watching you feed Stephen?

35:54.280 --> 35:56.720
Think of all the
concerts you missed.

35:56.720 --> 36:00.720
Are you kidding?
The happiest time of my life.

36:01.920 --> 36:05.920
# Fight, fight, Pennsylv-a-n-ia,
fight on... #

36:18.040 --> 36:20.440
Just remember, this isn't forever.

36:20.440 --> 36:22.400
I made arrangements with
Dr Auschlander.

36:22.400 --> 36:26.400
I'll be back as soon as I find
someone to take over for me.

36:27.120 --> 36:30.280
     I've thought about it...

36:30.280 --> 36:34.280
          ..and, erm....

36:34.320 --> 36:36.280
       ..I'm going with you.

36:36.280 --> 36:39.160
Are you kidding?

36:39.160 --> 36:41.720
You'd melt in the heat.

36:41.720 --> 36:44.600
You're probably
allergic to magnolias.

36:44.600 --> 36:48.600
And everyone would hate your guts
because you're a Yankee snot.

36:48.760 --> 36:50.920
       I love you, Roxanne.

36:50.920 --> 36:54.320
I love you.

36:54.320 --> 36:55.680
             OK, then.

36:55.680 --> 36:59.000
But I'm still going.

36:59.000 --> 37:02.040
     You know, I don't get it.

37:02.040 --> 37:06.040
I thought you and I,
I thought we wanted to be together.

37:06.080 --> 37:09.880
Doing the work I have to do at home
is gonna be hard enough, without you

37:09.880 --> 37:12.080
following me around like a puppy.

37:12.080 --> 37:15.640
              Puppy?

37:15.640 --> 37:19.640
Look, I'm not the one who's
jeopardising my career or my

37:19.640 --> 37:23.040
personal life because I feel guilty
about walking out of the backwoods.

37:23.040 --> 37:25.840
I'm not the one who says,
"Yes, Master,"

37:25.840 --> 37:28.560
to some farmer who you made
the mistake of marrying,

37:28.560 --> 37:31.840
     so don't you "puppy" me.

37:31.840 --> 37:33.520
You know,

37:33.520 --> 37:36.160
all those years of ivy-covered
medical education

37:36.160 --> 37:39.200
and you still don't know
     how fragile people are.

37:39.200 --> 37:43.040
If you really loved me, you
would never have said that.

37:43.040 --> 37:46.760
For once in your life, try
thinking of someone beside yourself.

37:46.760 --> 37:50.000
It might make you a better doctor.

37:50.000 --> 37:54.000
Goodbye, Philip.

38:16.080 --> 38:18.880
'You can rev it up out there,
  Chuck.'

38:18.880 --> 38:21.800
         I see something.

38:21.800 --> 38:23.200
'Nothing out there.'

38:23.200 --> 38:25.080
       Nothing is something.

38:25.080 --> 38:28.760
'It's a vacuum,
good buddy, the big hoover.'

38:28.760 --> 38:30.840
Maybe that's just our perspective.

38:30.840 --> 38:32.720
    I breathe, therefore I am.

38:32.720 --> 38:34.840
      Limited point of view.

38:34.840 --> 38:38.840
'Computer's working on the  "breathe,
therefore I am" postulate.'

38:38.920 --> 38:42.400
If time and space are relative,
so is life.

38:42.400 --> 38:44.600
        And what about God?

38:44.600 --> 38:48.480
Ruler of the universe, maker
of all that is seen and unseen.

38:48.480 --> 38:50.480
       The alpha and omega.

38:50.480 --> 38:53.200
'We have no date on the creator
at this time.

38:53.200 --> 38:56.120
'Advise enlightenment through
  annihilation is not, repeat,

38:56.120 --> 38:58.280
'not on flight plan.

38:58.280 --> 39:02.080
'Come on back inside.

39:02.080 --> 39:04.040
'You're dead now.'

39:04.040 --> 39:05.840
                No.

39:05.840 --> 39:07.080
'Those are the rules.'

39:07.080 --> 39:11.080
No respiration.

39:13.000 --> 39:17.000
We've got a pulse.

39:21.400 --> 39:25.400
    No... OK, let's do it here.

39:29.520 --> 39:31.520
  You got your test results back.

39:31.520 --> 39:33.480
Where's Dr Turner?

39:33.480 --> 39:35.000
        Well, she's, er...

39:35.000 --> 39:37.160
            She's gone.

39:37.160 --> 39:41.160
The human chorionic
gonadotropin is rising,

39:41.520 --> 39:44.800
suggesting the presence of
tissue other than corpus luteum.

39:44.800 --> 39:46.160
What does that mean?

39:46.160 --> 39:49.320
     It means you're pregnant.

39:49.320 --> 39:50.760
All right!  We did it!

39:50.760 --> 39:54.760
Yeah, oh!

40:19.840 --> 40:22.000
Luther, I want you to go down to the
kitchen

40:22.000 --> 40:24.120
and bring five more meals to Mr
Zapeta's room.

40:24.120 --> 40:25.360
I don't think I can do that.

40:25.360 --> 40:26.080
             Why not?

40:26.080 --> 40:28.440
             Why not?
You know how the dietician
is, one meal per customer.

40:28.440 --> 40:32.440
All right, never mind,
I'll take care of it myself.

40:51.640 --> 40:53.880
What the hell's going on?

40:53.880 --> 40:56.960
I come out of my exam to find out
that you tried to kill yourself.

40:56.960 --> 40:59.800
  Almost reached escape velocity.

40:59.800 --> 41:03.240
You're a lucky man, you know that?

41:03.240 --> 41:06.080
If you had snapped your spinal cord,

41:06.080 --> 41:08.760
you would have been paralysed.
For good, this time.

41:08.760 --> 41:10.400
 Won't you take these things off?

41:10.400 --> 41:13.880
Why, so you can try it again?
Why d'you do it, Colonel?

41:13.880 --> 41:16.720
  I've experienced the infinite.

41:16.720 --> 41:20.720
This world is nothing, these
walls are nothing, you are nothing!

41:22.880 --> 41:25.360
So life has no meaning,
it has no purpose?

41:25.360 --> 41:28.000
That's not spiritual enlightenment,
it's nihilism.

41:28.000 --> 41:30.440
I almost got outside the envelope!

41:30.440 --> 41:32.760
If God put you here,
what gives you the right

41:32.760 --> 41:35.520
to decide when it's time to leave?

41:35.520 --> 41:38.840
Being a doctor's a big
deal to you, isn't it?

41:38.840 --> 41:42.240
A holy mission to save lives,
but all you're really doing is

41:42.240 --> 41:43.680
 keeping people from joining God!

41:43.680 --> 41:46.520
You'll be transferred to
Bethesda tomorrow morning.

41:46.520 --> 41:50.520
No matter what you do,
God wins eventually.

41:50.840 --> 41:54.840
So what you're doing
is a waste of time.

41:59.040 --> 42:03.040
   See you in heaven, Morrison.

42:06.000 --> 42:09.280
Dr Auschlander's been
looking everywhere for you.

42:09.280 --> 42:10.800
Did he say what he wanted?

42:10.800 --> 42:14.800
Probably wants to congratulate
you, heard you passed the test.

42:21.960 --> 42:25.960
Phil, you lucky dog,
      have a great vacation.

42:41.840 --> 42:43.720
Phil.

42:43.720 --> 42:46.360
Ah, damn...

42:46.360 --> 42:48.760
Halo round the moon.

42:48.760 --> 42:50.440
               Yeah.

42:50.440 --> 42:54.440
  I'll take my raincoat tomorrow.

42:54.600 --> 42:58.600
Muchas gracias, Dr Westphall...

42:59.840 --> 43:01.400
Thank you.

43:01.400 --> 43:05.400
          You're welcome.

43:07.000 --> 43:08.840
 Her brother's a patient upstairs.

43:08.840 --> 43:12.560
He's weak from malnutrition,
but he's giving all his meals

43:12.560 --> 43:16.040
        away to those kids.

43:16.040 --> 43:18.240
And we spend a billion
dollars putting a golf

43:18.240 --> 43:19.880
 cart in the Sea of Tranquillity.

43:19.880 --> 43:22.280
It's always been easier to
explore the unknown rather

43:22.280 --> 43:24.160
than solve the problems at hand.

43:24.160 --> 43:28.000
You know, Daniel, when I
came back from Ethiopia, I was

43:28.000 --> 43:32.000
determined to rouse people from their
indifference towards human suffering.

43:32.320 --> 43:35.040
Now, six weeks later,
the board has adopted only two

43:35.040 --> 43:38.200
of the proposals and they've yet to
put either one of them into action.

43:38.200 --> 43:41.320
And then when I talk to the
residents about community service,

43:41.320 --> 43:43.280
all I get back
is this apathetic stare.

43:43.280 --> 43:45.680
It takes time.

43:45.680 --> 43:48.440
You didn't really expect
everyone to drop into

43:48.440 --> 43:50.960
step behind you just like that?

43:50.960 --> 43:54.960
   Yeah. Yes, I did. Good night.

44:05.080 --> 44:08.040
BABY CRIES

44:08.040 --> 44:12.040
It's crying.

44:12.800 --> 44:16.800
         Go back to sleep.

44:36.640 --> 44:39.320
            Hey, babs.

44:39.320 --> 44:43.320
        What's the matter?

44:43.880 --> 44:47.880
     You can't be hungry. Hmm?

44:50.160 --> 44:53.280
        You don't feel wet.

44:53.280 --> 44:57.280
Maybe it was a bad dream, huh? Yeah.

45:01.440 --> 45:03.600
              Yes...

45:03.600 --> 45:07.160
             Mm-hmm...

45:07.160 --> 45:11.080
               Yes.

45:11.080 --> 45:14.080
        Yes. There we are.

45:14.080 --> 45:18.080
           There we are.

45:19.960 --> 45:23.960
               Yes.

45:25.920 --> 45:29.920
        A surgeon's hands.

45:34.640 --> 46:03.000
