WEBVTT

00:23.672 --> 00:26.372
Now, we know that you've
received upwards of £100

00:26.424 --> 00:28.875
from Mr. Mathews, the
so-called mayor of New York.

00:28.877 --> 00:32.378
And Governor Tryon. Your pulse beats
high in the Tories' game, gentlemen.

00:32.430 --> 00:35.048
Now, tell me, who else in this camp

00:35.100 --> 00:36.883
is under British pay?

00:37.769 --> 00:39.485
What are you offering?

00:40.021 --> 00:41.566
So there are others.

Ben: <i>The offer is that you hang</i>

00:53.234 --> 00:55.568
<i>for counterfeiting, not for treason.</i>

00:55.570 --> 00:58.037
I wish to be hanged for treason.

00:58.073 --> 01:01.074
To mutiny against you
traitors is an act of honor.

01:02.327 --> 01:04.410
If you hang as a forger,

01:04.412 --> 01:06.546
your family may escape reprisal.

01:06.581 --> 01:09.082
If you're marked as an
assassin, I cannot...

01:09.084 --> 01:11.501
We aren't going to hang.

01:15.507 --> 01:17.557
You're going to trade us.

01:17.592 --> 01:19.309
(scoffs)

01:19.344 --> 01:21.260
For Culper.

01:25.266 --> 01:27.433
Where did you hear that name?

01:28.269 --> 01:30.770
<i>(drums continue)</i>

01:36.077 --> 01:37.944
Where did you hear that name?!

01:39.864 --> 01:42.193
Sergeant Hickey must have heard it

01:42.218 --> 01:44.057
while standing guard outside my tent.

01:47.839 --> 01:51.457
The first man to tell me the
true name of our Agent Culper

01:51.459 --> 01:54.043
will be traded to safety on Saturday.

01:56.214 --> 01:58.715
The other man will hang tomorrow.

<i>(wind whistling)</i>

02:19.654 --> 02:22.622
and Sergeant Thomas Hickey...

02:22.657 --> 02:25.625

Where is he?

04:03.110 --> 04:04.530
I warned you not to do this.

04:05.414 --> 04:06.698
I begged both of you.

04:06.966 --> 04:09.268
I just told Aberdeen to clear supper.

04:10.843 --> 04:11.937
Abraham will be home shortly.

04:12.509 --> 04:14.239
You've been saying that since sundown.

04:15.901 --> 04:17.409
Thomas.

04:19.031 --> 04:21.368
Do you know where your father is?

04:21.404 --> 04:24.525
I told you, after he walked
Thomas home, Abe went to town.

04:25.055 --> 04:27.646
To get provisions even though
we have all we need here.

04:27.682 --> 04:29.347
I'm sure he had good reason.

04:29.784 --> 04:32.348
Now, my little soldier,

04:33.121 --> 04:35.020
did Dada take you down
to the wharf today?

04:35.056 --> 04:37.690
- I told you that they did.
- I know what you said.

04:39.761 --> 04:41.060
- Thomas...
- Thomas, it's getting late.

04:41.095 --> 04:43.529
- I am talking to my grandson.
-<i> (door opens)</i>

04:48.703 --> 04:49.969
Didn't miss supper, did I?

04:50.004 --> 04:52.004
And breakfast and lunch. Where were you?

04:52.040 --> 04:53.539
I was at the farm.

04:55.977 --> 04:58.010
Yeah, I'm sorry if I kept
you all waiting.

04:58.046 --> 05:00.947
Mary said you went into
town to get provisions.

05:04.251 --> 05:06.001
Well, yeah. I did, yeah.

05:06.036 --> 05:07.836
After town, I went to the farm.

05:07.871 --> 05:09.521
I have to buy seed if I'm
to replant the cabbage.

05:09.557 --> 05:11.324
- Hi.
- Hi.

05:11.359 --> 05:13.359
So you bought cabbage seed from DeJong?

05:13.945 --> 05:16.628
Uh, no, the store was closed,
so I have to go back tomorrow.

05:19.047 --> 05:21.307
- I think I'm ready for bed.
- It's time for Thomas as well.

05:21.367 --> 05:23.716
Yeah. Good night, Father. Come on.

05:25.887 --> 05:26.930
Anna.

05:27.774 --> 05:28.854
Rest well.

05:29.457 --> 05:31.558
- Abe.
- Father.

05:33.228 --> 05:34.182
Abraham.

05:34.796 --> 05:37.597
- Up you go.
- Have you seen my pistol?

05:37.632 --> 05:38.910
Your pistol?

05:41.002 --> 05:42.350
I would check with Aberdeen.

<i>(door opens)</i>

05:51.294 --> 05:52.345
<i>(door closes)</i>

05:56.426 --> 05:58.885

- It's done.

05:59.770 --> 06:01.621
Can't you please just leave it
at that for tonight, huh?

06:03.427 --> 06:05.428
Abe, what is that?

06:06.013 --> 06:07.330
What is that mark on your throat?

06:09.788 --> 06:11.288
Look, Eastin is dead, all right?

06:11.323 --> 06:12.890
- But he didn't fall without a fight.
- He had a rope?

06:12.925 --> 06:14.158
Mary, please, please, please. It's done.

06:14.193 --> 06:15.759
I don't want to talk
about it, all right?

06:15.761 --> 06:17.494
Tomorrow I have to go out and move
his body before it's discovered.

06:17.530 --> 06:20.063
- You haven't moved his body?
- Will you just calm down?

06:20.099 --> 06:22.132
Keep your mind focused on your task.

06:22.168 --> 06:25.435
Don't forget, I still need a copy
of Hewlett's encrypting plate.

06:25.495 --> 06:27.245
I need a sample
of Major André's handwriting.

06:27.281 --> 06:29.331
I need them both so I can
plant that letter.

06:29.366 --> 06:30.899
- I will...
- Hewlett must believe

06:30.934 --> 06:32.934
that André has no interest
in meeting me.

06:32.970 --> 06:35.637
Otherwise this is...
this is all for nothing.

06:35.672 --> 06:37.238
I will, Abe, I will.

06:37.274 --> 06:39.741
- But if your father sees this...
- He won't.

06:39.776 --> 06:42.797
- He already suspects you.
- Well, yeah, he always does.

06:42.834 --> 06:44.714
Like always, he'll do nothing.

06:49.924 --> 06:51.491
There's something you're not saying.

06:52.076 --> 06:54.561
You're right. Come here.

06:59.334 --> 07:00.835
(sighs)

07:02.344 --> 07:03.456
I never said thank you.

07:04.753 --> 07:05.830
Our plan is working.

07:08.065 --> 07:09.159
Your plan.

07:10.619 --> 07:11.254
Hmm?

07:12.454 --> 07:15.522
I couldn't have done this
without you, do you know that?

07:18.694 --> 07:20.065
One more day

07:21.493 --> 07:23.409
and this will all be behind us.

07:24.433 --> 07:26.666
All right?

07:26.702 --> 07:28.025
No more pistols.

07:30.098 --> 07:31.624
No more plots.

07:48.940 --> 07:51.707
Do you like it? It's a Phaeton Spider.

07:51.742 --> 07:52.875
Oh, General, welcome!

07:52.910 --> 07:55.110
I had it fit with a Collinge
axle for a smoother ride.

07:55.146 --> 07:57.179
- Indeed, very smooth.
- Woman: <i> General Arnold!</i>

07:57.215 --> 08:00.749
So, have you been able to find
a husband for your sister yet?

08:00.785 --> 08:03.285
I'm afraid I must first
find her a suitor

08:03.321 --> 08:05.621
who in time may become a fiancé
and then eventually a husband.

08:05.656 --> 08:07.640
And how long with this take?

08:07.694 --> 08:10.378
Because you already have a suitor
and fiancé champing at the bit.

08:10.661 --> 08:13.445
General Cadwalader bet me
a dozen pair of gloves

08:13.481 --> 08:15.598
that a dozen of my friends
would be wed by next Christmas.

08:15.650 --> 08:17.115
Next Christmas.

08:17.420 --> 08:19.718
- Next Christmas?
- Don't worry.

08:19.770 --> 08:21.237
I expect to win, of course.

08:21.272 --> 08:23.355
- Man: We love you, sir!
- Man #2: Welcome home, sir!

08:23.838 --> 08:25.864
When were you talking
to John Cadwalader?

08:26.762 --> 08:28.444
He's engaged to my friend
Williamina Bond.

08:28.496 --> 08:30.246
You remember Williamina.

08:39.249 --> 08:40.522
Benedict?

08:42.818 --> 08:44.118
Who was that?

08:45.282 --> 08:46.621
Joseph Reed,

08:46.978 --> 08:49.724
former aide-de-camp
to General Washington.

08:50.280 --> 08:53.511
He now lords over Pennsylvania's
supreme executive council

08:53.546 --> 08:56.364
and believes Philadelphia
to be his very own fiefdom.

08:56.726 --> 08:59.527
I thought Washington put you
in charge of the city.

08:59.562 --> 09:00.695
Indeed.

09:00.730 --> 09:02.964
- General, sir.
- Sir.

09:04.434 --> 09:06.351
(nickers)

09:08.238 --> 09:09.728
Why have we stopped?

09:10.464 --> 09:12.190
Because we are here.

09:12.225 --> 09:14.776
I give you Penn Mansion.

09:17.983 --> 09:22.352
The British have stripped it
of its furnishings,

09:22.886 --> 09:24.654
but I am rectifying that.

09:26.124 --> 09:29.993
Would you care to see your
future home, Mrs. Arnold?

09:33.208 --> 09:36.475
Benedict, you know I can't accompany
you in without a chaperone.

09:36.945 --> 09:40.012
Oh, come now. We're in plain
sight of the entire city.

09:40.048 --> 09:41.013
Precisely.

09:41.549 --> 09:44.350
All of Philadelphia sees
and all of Philadelphia talks,

09:44.385 --> 09:46.185
making it all the more important

09:46.221 --> 09:48.321
to adhere to etiquette and protocol.

09:51.286 --> 09:52.883
I will abide by protocol

09:54.395 --> 09:57.590
if you promise to abide
by our understanding.

09:58.463 --> 09:59.891
<i>If you cannot see the house now,</i>

09:59.926 --> 10:02.408
then perhaps you will find
a way to visit tonight

10:03.360 --> 10:04.913
when no one will be watching.

10:09.890 --> 10:11.402
Take Miss Shippen home.

10:14.441 --> 10:16.407

- Ah, General Arnold. Well met, sir.

10:36.592 --> 10:39.159
- What is this?
- This? This is the shipment, sir.

10:39.195 --> 10:40.861
The sequestered property
from Stansbury Manor.

10:40.896 --> 10:42.396
Yes, I know what it is.

10:42.431 --> 10:45.099
What is it doing here in a pile?

10:45.134 --> 10:47.134
My instructions were clear.

10:47.563 --> 10:50.031
The clock is to be placed
in that corner.

10:50.066 --> 10:52.700
The dining room table in the dining room

10:52.735 --> 10:54.268
with the chairs surrounding it.

10:54.303 --> 10:56.103
Yes, my foreman had your instructions.

10:56.139 --> 10:58.506
- I told him there must be some mistake.
- Mistake?

10:58.541 --> 11:01.842
General Arnold, as commissioner
of forfeiture for this district,

11:02.070 --> 11:06.239
my charge is to transport these items
confiscated from the enemies of America

11:06.241 --> 11:08.274
to a military storehouse
for safekeeping...

11:08.309 --> 11:10.576
- They are perfectly safe here.
- ...whereupon the seized items

11:10.612 --> 11:12.759
are to be sold at public
auction within 10 days.

11:12.786 --> 11:14.853
Whereupon the proceeds go to you.

11:14.888 --> 11:17.689
No, they go to purchase
provisions needed by the army.

11:17.724 --> 11:20.024
I am the army.

11:20.060 --> 11:22.594
And your reimbursement will have to wait

11:23.064 --> 11:26.132
as I have been forced
to wait for three years

11:26.167 --> 11:28.334
for Congress to repay me one pound

11:28.369 --> 11:30.437
of the 10,000 owed to me.

11:31.469 --> 11:34.857
Three whole years
fighting for our country

11:34.893 --> 11:38.477
with no recompense
save wounds got in battle

11:38.513 --> 11:40.813
while you sit in a chair sequestering,

11:40.848 --> 11:43.660
collecting from those
enemies of America,

11:43.754 --> 11:46.855
your former neighbors, as they are
forced to sell their possessions

11:46.890 --> 11:49.357
upon flight like the Hebrews
out of old Egypt.

11:49.393 --> 11:52.894
Not enough time to take out
their parlor chairs!

11:52.930 --> 11:54.796
Get out!

- What?

12:26.268 --> 12:27.634
You know what.

12:27.670 --> 12:29.937
If Major André saw you
with his papers...

Why did you teach me to read, then?

Good morning, Abigail.

12:49.198 --> 12:50.411
Is your master home?

12:50.448 --> 12:52.448
Major André isn't here, sir,

12:53.023 --> 12:54.216
nor is he my master.

12:54.715 --> 12:56.845
Quite right. My apologies.

12:57.645 --> 12:58.867
He is mine, however,

12:58.919 --> 13:01.069
insofar as I owe him my current station

13:01.104 --> 13:02.742
and must harken to his summons.

13:05.625 --> 13:10.056
Oh, I see Akinbode succeeded in his
task of delivering your son to you.

13:10.799 --> 13:12.447
Do you happen to know
where he went afterward?

13:13.478 --> 13:16.162
No, sir. I assumed he went to you.

13:16.198 --> 13:17.597
That was our understanding,

13:17.852 --> 13:19.218
but he hasn't rejoined the unit

13:19.253 --> 13:21.086
even after we returned
to the main column.

13:22.998 --> 13:25.257
I... I can't... I can't
guess where else he'd be.

13:25.791 --> 13:28.227
He did speak of how proud he
was to be a Queen's Ranger.

13:28.535 --> 13:29.595
If he's absent for much longer,

13:29.597 --> 13:32.287
I shall have to consider
the possibility of desertion.

13:33.095 --> 13:35.701
I do hope that isn't
the case for his sake.

13:36.871 --> 13:37.910
Ah.

13:39.432 --> 13:40.761
Captain Simcoe.

13:42.889 --> 13:44.721
Please excuse my late arrival.

13:44.757 --> 13:48.225
Abigail, a flask of the Palomino
for the captain and myself.

13:48.261 --> 13:49.994
Yes, sir.

13:50.029 --> 13:51.262
Please sit.

13:52.733 --> 13:54.546
I just came from a meeting
with General Clinton.

13:54.582 --> 13:56.582
He specifically praised the performance

13:56.617 --> 13:58.350
of the Queen's Rangers at Monmouth.

13:59.388 --> 14:02.789
<i>And I quote, "Under
Captain Simcoe's command,</i>

14:02.824 --> 14:07.093
the provincial forces have matured
into a proper fighting unit.

14:08.469 --> 14:09.564
Indeed,

14:10.542 --> 14:12.432
with great contrast to the motley rabble

14:12.467 --> 14:14.234
raised by Robert Rogers."

14:14.269 --> 14:15.421
Thank you, sir.

14:16.102 --> 14:18.350
We eagerly await our next deployment.

14:18.605 --> 14:21.119
We do hope it will not
involve another retreat.

14:24.401 --> 14:25.241
No.

14:26.553 --> 14:27.797
<i>During your patrols of Long Island,</i>

14:27.833 --> 14:31.260
did you ever come across a fellow
by the name of Samuel Culper?

14:31.807 --> 14:33.203
I'm afraid not. Who is he?

14:33.538 --> 14:36.939
Well, according to the personal notes
of Major Benjamin Tallmadge...

14:36.941 --> 14:38.441
you do remember that name, don't you?

14:38.476 --> 14:39.741
Most definitely.

14:40.745 --> 14:44.380
A small but effective spy ring has
been operating right under our nose,

14:45.121 --> 14:47.122
smuggling intelligence across the sound.

14:48.091 --> 14:51.492
So, Tallmadge is running
a man inside New York.

14:52.338 --> 14:53.614
Or Long Island.

14:53.930 --> 14:55.015
Or both.

14:55.211 --> 14:56.944
Using a whale boatman as a courier.

14:58.287 --> 15:00.930
<i>It appears that this Samuel Culper</i>

15:00.967 --> 15:03.076
<i>is the anchor to the conspiracy.</i>

15:03.112 --> 15:07.648
<i>Officially, your orders will be to
resume your hunt for hidden rebels,</i>

15:07.683 --> 15:12.085
<i>though your real target is this one man.</i>

15:12.919 --> 15:14.079
Could be an alias.

15:15.904 --> 15:16.969
Culper.

15:17.498 --> 15:19.965
Could be a false name
to hide his true one.

15:24.859 --> 15:26.949
Abraham, your father made mention

15:26.984 --> 15:29.518
that you will be departing Whitehall

15:29.553 --> 15:31.220
and returning to your farm.

15:31.445 --> 15:33.445
Yes, sir. I believe I've relied

15:33.480 --> 15:34.880
on the hospitality
of my father long enough.

15:34.915 --> 15:37.566
- Hmm.
- Where will you live?

15:38.045 --> 15:40.052
Luke and Jeremiah's cabin
is still standing, so...

15:43.524 --> 15:44.956
Now if you'll excuse me,

15:46.217 --> 15:47.626
I need to make sure of that roof.

15:47.898 --> 15:49.280
Today?

15:49.547 --> 15:51.000
Of all days?

15:53.592 --> 15:56.000
It's the anniversary
of your mother's death.

15:57.771 --> 16:00.037
I intend to visit
her stone after breakfast

16:00.073 --> 16:02.707
and hoped you, Mary, and
Thomas would accompany me.

16:05.311 --> 16:07.445
Uh, well, I can...

16:07.447 --> 16:10.648
I mean, I can see if I can get
finished with the roof early.

16:10.683 --> 16:11.639
You know?

16:13.240 --> 16:14.343
She knows that I visit her often enough.

16:14.378 --> 16:17.079
And I... I'm very sorry, Father,

16:17.115 --> 16:19.181
but if I had known that today was...

16:21.120 --> 16:23.600
Father, why don't you take Thomas?

16:24.768 --> 16:27.130
Yes, that's a wonderful idea.
Why don't you take Thomas?

16:29.167 --> 16:30.776
"Ingratitude,

16:31.792 --> 16:33.848
more strong than traitors' arm,

16:34.139 --> 16:35.905
quite vanquished him,

16:36.291 --> 16:38.558
<i>then burst his mighty heart."</i>

16:38.593 --> 16:40.843
<i>(clock chiming)</i>

16:42.430 --> 16:43.543
Get him dressed.

16:44.099 --> 16:45.865
<i>(bird screeching)</i>

17:13.676 --> 17:14.653
Hello?

17:27.840 --> 17:29.141
(footsteps)

17:29.423 --> 17:31.192
- Did you bring me breakfast? - Christ!

17:32.520 --> 17:33.392
Did you?

17:34.386 --> 17:35.852
Here.

17:37.412 --> 17:39.662
We should move off this road
before someone sees you.

17:40.122 --> 17:42.280
It's safe down in the root cellar.
No one will...

17:42.317 --> 17:44.283
(groans)

17:44.319 --> 17:46.586
- (groans)
- Much obliged.

17:46.621 --> 17:47.952
- Stay down.
- (shouts)

17:49.337 --> 17:51.306
Ah, what have we here?

17:51.521 --> 17:53.508
Oh.

17:54.105 --> 17:55.674
Compliments to your wife.

17:58.548 --> 18:00.281
You didn't tell her about us, did you?

18:00.316 --> 18:02.249
No. No.

18:02.285 --> 18:03.500
Of course you didn't.

18:04.183 --> 18:06.683
That's why you tried
to fix it by yourself.

18:06.718 --> 18:09.686
Tried to rid yourself

18:09.721 --> 18:12.455
of old Robert Rogers.

18:14.416 --> 18:17.405
You can't kill your secrets, lad,

18:17.573 --> 18:21.275
because they have a nasty habit
of coming back from the dead.

18:21.310 --> 18:22.543
You can't kill me either.

18:22.577 --> 18:25.478
I can and I will, just not yet.

18:25.820 --> 18:28.914
You're nothing to me but bait, boy.

18:30.251 --> 18:31.573
I'm gonna use you

18:31.986 --> 18:33.589
like a squishy worm

18:34.557 --> 18:38.759
to get close to my old
friend John André.

18:40.163 --> 18:42.864
And live bait is better than dead.

18:42.899 --> 18:44.207
Where did you move the body?

18:45.389 --> 18:47.250
- Went looking for him, did you?
- Where is he?

18:48.103 --> 18:49.127
Where's Eastin?

18:51.043 --> 18:52.476
Trying to get back into his britches?

18:52.511 --> 18:54.144
No, no, I was looking
for his dispatch case.

18:54.179 --> 18:56.446
I need to replace the letter that's
inside. It's very important.

18:57.038 --> 18:59.148
If you want to start a war

18:59.607 --> 19:01.619
between the Rangers and the redcoats,

19:01.653 --> 19:04.088
why not just leave the body there?

19:05.064 --> 19:06.790
Why all the extra hugger-mugger?

19:07.369 --> 19:08.096
Hmm?

19:08.833 --> 19:11.951
All right, I...
I convinced Major Hewlett

19:12.003 --> 19:13.402
that I was a double agent.

19:13.759 --> 19:17.572
Now he wants to pass my name
up the chain on to André

19:17.847 --> 19:19.980
so that now I have to report to him.

19:20.981 --> 19:23.065
So I killed Hewlett's messenger
on the way to the city,

19:23.101 --> 19:25.167
but I need to make it look like
he was killed on his way back

19:25.832 --> 19:27.295
carrying a letter from André

19:27.331 --> 19:29.682
that says he has no need
to meet a simple farmer.

19:29.717 --> 19:31.867
All right? If I don't do that,
Hewlett sends another messenger

19:31.902 --> 19:33.469
and then I'm not live bait, I'm dead.

19:33.504 --> 19:34.872
So if you want to use me,

19:35.573 --> 19:37.117
you're gonna have to help me.

19:43.114 --> 19:45.998
That's some serpentine shite there, boy.

19:47.575 --> 19:50.375
(laughing)

19:51.679 --> 19:54.513
You and I are going to have
a grand time together.

19:55.749 --> 19:56.881
Just grand.

19:58.586 --> 19:59.562
Come on.

19:59.954 --> 20:01.858
I'll show you where I buried the body.

20:03.588 --> 20:04.787
Buried?

20:04.822 --> 20:07.089
Come on.

20:11.043 --> 20:13.394
<i>(harpsichord playing)</i>

20:17.066 --> 20:20.284
(no audible dialogue)

20:44.178 --> 20:45.354
You're improving.

20:45.919 --> 20:47.152
Not really.

20:47.187 --> 20:49.120
<i>(clock ticking)</i>

20:49.156 --> 20:51.556
Mary said that you
wanted to speak to me.

20:54.012 --> 20:54.992
Did she?

20:55.290 --> 20:58.195
Yes. Something of a
private, personal matter

20:58.232 --> 21:00.432
that you were debating whether
or not to come forward with.

21:07.593 --> 21:09.143
Yes.

21:19.523 --> 21:20.666
Um...

21:22.440 --> 21:24.047
yes, I...

21:24.676 --> 21:28.945
there was something I wish
to speak with you about.

21:31.635 --> 21:32.770
I was thinking,

21:34.071 --> 21:36.729
and I wonder if it may
not be better for all,

21:37.871 --> 21:40.638
if I moved back into Strong Manor.

21:42.342 --> 21:46.534
<i>When Abraham spoke of intruding
on his father's hospitality,</i>

21:46.913 --> 21:49.914
I was forced to examine
my own imposition.

21:51.651 --> 21:53.246
I see.

21:54.671 --> 21:56.654
Well, that might be a problem.

21:58.405 --> 22:01.673
Well, I don't seek to reclaim
ownership, of course.

22:02.245 --> 22:03.642
<i>Just residence.</i>

22:03.677 --> 22:04.478
Anna.

22:05.830 --> 22:08.318
I mean a problem for me.

22:10.328 --> 22:12.778
When you say it would be better for all,

22:12.813 --> 22:16.932
I can't help but think that you're
referring to the magistrate.

22:19.556 --> 22:22.674
<i>For you, leaving Whitehall</i>
<i>could not be seen</i>

22:22.709 --> 22:25.518
as anything else than a very dark day

22:25.862 --> 22:28.217
for the man who now sits before you.

22:29.299 --> 22:31.700
A year ago, I would not have
been able to say these things

22:31.735 --> 22:33.540
without tripping over my tongue,

22:35.181 --> 22:37.582
but I'm not the same man as I was.

22:39.452 --> 22:40.511
I've been changed

22:40.987 --> 22:44.789
<i>by this place, by what I've seen...</i>

22:45.859 --> 22:47.245
<i>what I have survived.</i>

22:51.840 --> 22:53.376
And by the people I've met.

22:55.682 --> 22:57.114
My dear Anna,

22:58.496 --> 23:01.448
ever since I've had the
opportunity of knowing you,

23:02.505 --> 23:04.200
I've been in love with you.

23:05.638 --> 23:08.172
And I have no doubts

23:08.208 --> 23:11.375
that you perceive my
passions to be sincere.

23:11.411 --> 23:15.446
If you allow me to be your
protector through life,

23:15.482 --> 23:19.717
I swear that I will commit
myself to your happiness

23:20.407 --> 23:23.598
<i>and I pray that you know that
I make my intentions clear</i>

23:23.990 --> 23:28.326
and from the deepest and
strictest motives of respect.

23:30.363 --> 23:31.695
Uh...

23:35.643 --> 23:36.794
thank you.

23:40.715 --> 23:41.650
Um...

23:42.650 --> 23:43.946
I beg your pardon.

24:11.312 --> 24:13.712
(crying)

24:17.806 --> 24:19.239
<i>(lock clicks)</i>

24:29.551 --> 24:31.367

<i>(birds squawking)</i>

24:59.628 --> 25:01.694
(coughs)

25:05.435 --> 25:07.702
Why'd you have to bury him?

25:07.738 --> 25:09.471
'Cause you killed him yesterday.

25:09.506 --> 25:11.289
<i>And a three-day-old body</i>

25:11.325 --> 25:13.875
<i>ain't nothing like a one-day-old body.</i>

25:15.551 --> 25:18.218
Any Ranger or redcoat who's seen combat

25:18.253 --> 25:19.486
will know the difference.

25:22.684 --> 25:24.450
(sniffs, groans)

25:29.318 --> 25:30.360
What are you doing?

25:31.053 --> 25:34.989
I am inviting the forest to feast

25:35.024 --> 25:37.925
and cover your mistakes.

25:39.306 --> 25:41.940
Aye, you've got a lot
to learn from me, eh?

25:43.208 --> 25:46.310
About killing. About farming.

25:46.345 --> 25:47.636
I can't wait.

25:48.292 --> 25:51.126
You plant cabbages in the early summer,

25:51.692 --> 25:52.842
you get loose heads.

25:53.364 --> 25:54.413
<i>(groans)</i>

25:55.577 --> 25:57.343
Why have you come back here?

25:57.379 --> 26:00.446
I told you, I was betrayed.

26:00.448 --> 26:01.599
Betrayed by the king.

26:02.388 --> 26:04.788
The King of England in London,
not by John André in New York.

26:05.353 --> 26:06.436
Shut up.

26:06.496 --> 26:09.497
- You've got no stake left in this war.
- What?

26:09.533 --> 26:11.533
I mean, I don't... I don't
see why you just don't run.

26:11.568 --> 26:13.505
Why you don't just make
for the frontier.

26:13.839 --> 26:18.039
Eh? I'm a hunted man
with nothing left to lose.

26:18.074 --> 26:22.811
But you've got everything to
lose, haven't you, Woodhull?

26:22.846 --> 26:25.046
So why don't you run?

26:27.199 --> 26:27.918
Huh?

26:29.545 --> 26:32.836
Maybe you should go and get that
letter you intend to plant.

26:33.186 --> 26:35.520
Go and hurry along.
I'll finish digging him out.

26:35.555 --> 26:37.355
I'll meet you back at the root cellar.

26:39.159 --> 26:41.348
Oh, I still need my...

26:44.063 --> 26:46.129
the pistol, it's my father's.
He's noticed it's gone.

26:46.165 --> 26:47.890
Ah.

26:51.737 --> 26:53.115
Here.

26:53.939 --> 26:55.706
I reloaded it for you.

26:57.886 --> 27:00.003
(laughing)

27:12.518 --> 27:15.752
- I...
- It's quite all right. Don't be afraid.

27:16.189 --> 27:17.409
I was...

27:17.858 --> 27:19.504
There's no need to explain.

27:20.510 --> 27:24.212
Though I might suggest that if you
wish to conceal your movements,

27:24.673 --> 27:26.044
you leave no trace.

27:27.200 --> 27:28.232
(chuckles)

27:28.828 --> 27:31.729
And if you wish to improve your reading,

27:31.764 --> 27:33.664
then let's try something simpler.

27:35.923 --> 27:39.373
No, not those. Those are military
posts which you must never read.

27:39.425 --> 27:41.058
Note the red tape.

27:42.094 --> 27:45.483
But these are personal correspondents.

27:45.998 --> 27:47.659
No classification.

27:50.369 --> 27:51.339
Ah.

27:53.545 --> 27:55.226
Here's one from Philadelphia.

27:55.906 --> 28:00.108
From a Miss Peggy Shippen
to Miss Rebecca Franks

28:00.143 --> 28:02.773
in the care of yours truly.

28:04.913 --> 28:07.515
But I thought Philadelphia
was in the rebel army now.

28:08.542 --> 28:09.420
Indeed.

28:11.299 --> 28:13.933
That letter was delivered
through the lines

28:14.228 --> 28:15.560
under the flag of truce.

28:15.596 --> 28:18.297
<i>Its contents read</i>
<i>and resealed by both sides.</i>

28:19.321 --> 28:22.035
I offered to teach your mother
to read, but she declined.

28:22.918 --> 28:25.217
<i>Let's demonstrate the
benefit, shall we? Please.</i>

28:28.601 --> 28:29.929
"My dear Rebecca.

28:30.560 --> 28:34.128
I write to you
with affection and longing

28:34.954 --> 28:38.299
for our days of amusement
in Philadelphia.

28:38.784 --> 28:41.178
The most important news to be sure

28:41.803 --> 28:44.582
<i>is of my engagement</i>

28:45.296 --> 28:48.016
<i>to wed General Benedict Arnold</i>

28:48.982 --> 28:51.509
<i>following his repeated proposals</i>

28:52.085 --> 28:56.205
<i>and appr... appro... approbation."</i>

29:17.165 --> 29:18.331
You trying to get whupped?

29:18.367 --> 29:20.300
I was looking for something
to send to Miss Anna.

29:20.335 --> 29:21.113
Ah!

29:21.503 --> 29:23.229
We are not spies.

29:23.572 --> 29:25.906
That's something I had
to do to make you safe.

29:25.941 --> 29:27.874
And now that you are, I ain't
gonna see you strung up

29:27.910 --> 29:29.670
for some business
don't concern us at all.

29:30.245 --> 29:31.726
You understand me?

29:32.606 --> 29:34.916
Or you need me to write that down?

29:51.048 --> 29:53.802
When... when is Miss Shippen
to be married, sir?

29:55.609 --> 29:58.418
As soon as her sister is engaged.

30:00.592 --> 30:03.893
It's the only barrier between her and...

30:04.320 --> 30:05.312
and...

30:08.500 --> 30:09.833
A-Arnold.

30:11.905 --> 30:13.058
Her sister Betsy?

30:15.098 --> 30:16.002
Could be weeks.

30:18.339 --> 30:19.445
It could be months.

30:23.690 --> 30:24.905
It could be months.

30:33.635 --> 30:35.701
I need privacy.

30:40.222 --> 30:41.761
André's voice: <i>"Dear Miss Shippen,</i>

30:41.797 --> 30:44.030
<i>I am pleased to hear from Miss Franks</i>

30:44.066 --> 30:45.531
<i>of your impending union.</i>

30:45.934 --> 30:48.154
<i>Allow me to wish you the greatest joy.</i>

30:49.513 --> 30:52.147
<i>Your friends here</i>
<i>remark how they hope one day</i>

30:52.182 --> 30:54.749
<i>to meet your future husband,</i>

30:54.785 --> 30:57.796
<i>but they well understand the
obstacles to such a meeting.</i>

30:58.055 --> 30:59.845
<i>And though they miss you dreadfully,</i>

31:00.469 --> 31:03.470
<i>they know you are doing</i>
<i>everything you can</i>

31:03.505 --> 31:06.348
<i>to ensure the brightest</i>
<i>future possible."</i>

31:07.131 --> 31:09.276
Edward: Mr. Goodrich, I don't
know what else to tell you.

31:09.311 --> 31:11.645
- Just listen to us, Edward.
- What can I possibly do?

31:11.680 --> 31:13.747
Speak to him. Speak reason to him.

31:13.782 --> 31:17.517
Edward: <i>Benedict Arnold is military
commandant of Philadelphia</i>

31:17.553 --> 31:20.287
<i>and he is the highest</i>
<i>power in this city.</i>

31:20.322 --> 31:22.105
We can no longer tolerate this, Edward.

31:22.325 --> 31:24.692
Arnold uses his station
to line his own pockets

31:24.728 --> 31:26.027
at the expense of our interests.

31:26.062 --> 31:28.062
- Edward: Your interests?
- Goodrich: Yours as well.

31:28.098 --> 31:29.897
His reach extends to the shipping lines.

31:29.933 --> 31:33.147
- Dearborn: He's to be your family.
- What do you expect me to do?

31:34.272 --> 31:37.840
The Continental Army answers
to the Continental Congress.

31:37.875 --> 31:40.142
If they were to be made
aware of his abuses...

31:40.178 --> 31:42.211
Oh, fine, yes. You should do that.

31:42.246 --> 31:44.430
Me? I was hoping you would be the one.

31:44.465 --> 31:46.097
- Crane: <i> We should all go
to Congress and speak.</i>

31:46.122 --> 31:47.083
- Dearborn: <i> He's your relation.</i>

31:47.118 --> 31:48.751
Edward: <i>No, I couldn't possibly!</i>

31:48.786 --> 31:51.587
(chattering, laughing)

32:09.316 --> 32:11.602
Boy. Boy, come here.

32:15.327 --> 32:17.901
You look like a sweet lad.

32:18.549 --> 32:22.099
May I ask you to run this
letter in through that door,

32:22.134 --> 32:25.335
drop it on the big desk just
inside, and then run back out?

32:27.468 --> 32:28.478
Who's it for?

32:29.211 --> 32:32.746
If you're too frightened, I understand.

32:34.910 --> 32:36.117
What do I get for it?

32:36.151 --> 32:38.518
Well, a kiss, of course.

32:38.774 --> 32:40.754
You've got yourself a deal.

32:55.482 --> 32:56.627
Mary.

32:57.118 --> 32:59.652
<i>(men chattering)</i>

32:59.688 --> 33:01.354
Oh, gentlemen.

33:01.389 --> 33:04.057
Good God, man, you...
you smell a fright.

33:04.092 --> 33:05.792
- It's farm work.
- (exhales) Ooh.

33:05.827 --> 33:07.994
- Abe.
- Oh, there you are.

33:08.029 --> 33:11.091
I've been seeding all morning
and I'm dead starving, so...

33:12.132 --> 33:14.751
It's because you forgot vittles again.
Come here.

33:16.088 --> 33:18.121
You forget your stomach,
it'll be the death of you.

33:18.156 --> 33:19.320
Take some fruit.

33:19.991 --> 33:23.126
Well, actually, maybe I should
take dinner whilst I'm here

33:23.314 --> 33:25.047
'cause I might not be back until late.

33:25.083 --> 33:27.583
Dinner's not ready yet, but there's
pork outside in the smokehouse.

33:27.618 --> 33:29.705
That sounds good, yeah.
I'll take a look.

33:30.487 --> 33:32.487
I've only a few more rows left to plant,

33:32.512 --> 33:35.056
so shouldn't be too much longer.

33:35.993 --> 33:37.656
All right? You...

33:39.730 --> 33:41.129
kiss that boy for me.

33:41.164 --> 33:42.189
Major.

33:44.943 --> 33:47.343
Mary, I feel as if

33:47.379 --> 33:49.846
we should open some windows.

33:52.517 --> 33:54.667
<i>(men chattering)</i>

33:54.703 --> 33:56.753
(sighs)

34:04.280 --> 34:05.543
Rebecca.

34:08.384 --> 34:10.471
You already know what
I've come here to say.

34:14.730 --> 34:16.172
I failed.

34:18.260 --> 34:21.594
Failed to save our firstborn
from being killed in battle.

34:23.406 --> 34:26.139
And failed to raise
our second as a moral man,

34:26.175 --> 34:28.755
and for that I'm... I'm so sorry.

34:31.364 --> 34:33.695
Though all is not lost, thank God.

34:36.034 --> 34:39.070
I may not have been able
to save Abraham...

34:41.467 --> 34:43.735
<i>but there is still hope in young Thomas.</i>

34:46.085 --> 34:50.074
Perhaps the mistakes
I made in raising our son

34:50.329 --> 34:52.376
can be corrected through his own.

34:53.594 --> 34:56.594
I swear I will dedicate my life to him

34:56.629 --> 34:58.760
and this time I will not fail.

35:01.598 --> 35:04.000
<i>All that remains</i>
<i>is to ask your forgiveness</i>

35:04.693 --> 35:07.440
and grant me

35:07.871 --> 35:09.138
the strength

35:11.007 --> 35:12.624
to do what I must.

35:12.976 --> 35:15.009
<i>(Thomas giggles) Dead.</i>

35:15.045 --> 35:18.513
Dead. Dead. Dead.

35:19.644 --> 35:22.209
"What a tangled web we weave

35:22.245 --> 35:25.195
when first we practice to deceive."

35:25.481 --> 35:27.267
<i>You know "Macbeth," boy?</i>

35:27.292 --> 35:29.268
Yeah, I just need
to concentrate on this.

35:29.886 --> 35:31.890
(clatters)

35:33.082 --> 35:36.173
And you're wrong about André, by the by.

35:36.619 --> 35:39.553
It ain't revenge I'm
after, it's justice.

35:41.724 --> 35:43.991
(muttering)

35:44.026 --> 35:47.661
All men are created equal.

35:47.696 --> 35:49.830
Mmm, the Declaration.

35:49.865 --> 35:52.533
I read it, you know. (sighs)

35:52.568 --> 35:56.670
<i>All men are created equal.</i>

35:58.681 --> 35:59.980
<i>That's the truth</i>

36:00.015 --> 36:04.418
<i>that His Majesty</i>
<i>Farmer George can't face.</i>

36:05.521 --> 36:07.221
That's what really terrifies him.

36:07.256 --> 36:10.190
It really does and that's
what all those cowards

36:10.226 --> 36:12.964
like Tommy Gage and Johnny
André all run away from.

36:13.579 --> 36:16.936
All those commissioned officers
who look down on me,

36:17.704 --> 36:18.851
spat on me,

36:19.179 --> 36:21.710
took credit for my scalps,

36:22.976 --> 36:24.735
cursed me with half pay.

36:25.211 --> 36:26.577
(chuckles)

36:26.859 --> 36:29.093
They saw themselves above me.

36:29.845 --> 36:32.367
They refused to treat me like an equal

36:33.399 --> 36:36.700
just as Britain refuses America.

36:38.020 --> 36:40.399
<i>I mean to teach them different</i>

36:41.470 --> 36:44.838
by the justice I deliver to John André.

36:44.887 --> 36:48.121
That will be my Declaration

36:48.146 --> 36:50.026
before I leave these colonies.

36:50.952 --> 36:53.214
That they were never better than me.

36:56.479 --> 36:57.768
Sorry, what was that?

37:03.620 --> 37:06.254
(laughing)

37:08.145 --> 37:09.936
<i>Serves me right, I suppose.</i>

37:09.971 --> 37:11.637
(laughing)

37:11.672 --> 37:13.805
Come on, come on.

37:15.743 --> 37:17.469
Let's move a body.

37:26.635 --> 37:28.736
- (both panting)
-<i> (bird screeching)</i>

37:33.957 --> 37:37.275
So if I plant cabbage now...

37:37.310 --> 37:38.543
Hurry.

37:40.314 --> 37:43.248
If I plant now, you reckon loose heads?

37:43.284 --> 37:45.984
Eh? Oh, aye.

37:46.240 --> 37:50.075
When I was a lad,
we used to plant cabbages

37:50.110 --> 37:51.309
<i>back up in Mountalona.</i>

37:51.685 --> 37:53.618
<i>And if you plant later in the fall,</i>

37:53.653 --> 37:55.535
you get less maggots, too.

37:55.571 --> 37:58.089
- You hear that?
-<i> (bird screeching)</i>

37:58.125 --> 37:59.724
Run.

37:59.760 --> 38:01.593
Run!

38:12.172 --> 38:13.972
<i>(horse neighs)</i>

38:14.007 --> 38:16.875
(horse snorting)

38:18.231 --> 38:19.487
Halt.

38:21.813 --> 38:23.009
Dismount.

38:28.221 --> 38:30.955
(horses neighing)

38:30.991 --> 38:31.957
It's Eastin.

39:14.719 --> 39:17.987
You are truly

39:18.022 --> 39:20.490
the most beautiful woman

39:20.801 --> 39:23.030
in all of England and America.

39:23.270 --> 39:24.910
Thank you.

39:28.142 --> 39:29.678
Do you like the house?

39:31.111 --> 39:32.349
It's for you.

39:32.946 --> 39:35.681
- It's all for you.
- It's very grand.

39:37.017 --> 39:38.700
- I must be getting back now.
- No, no, no, stay.

39:38.752 --> 39:40.786
- Stay, please.
-<i> (pounding at door)</i>

-<i> (pounding)</i>
- Go.

Go there.

-<i> (pounding continues)</i>
- Reed: <i> General Arnold!</i>

39:54.444 --> 39:56.878
Check the inventory
against the manifest.

39:59.583 --> 40:00.967
What is this?

40:01.723 --> 40:04.119
A warrant signed by Congress.

40:04.827 --> 40:06.367
I want it all marked.

40:06.862 --> 40:08.895
Signed by you.

40:08.931 --> 40:10.897
This is a bloody writ of assistance.

40:11.313 --> 40:13.680
- Do you serve Great Britain now?
- Do you?

40:13.715 --> 40:15.448
For amongst the many
charges lain against you,

40:15.483 --> 40:17.784
most disturbing is the use
of military wagons

40:17.819 --> 40:21.454
to offload the Charming Nancy,
a known smuggling vessel.

40:21.489 --> 40:24.724
An action which could be seen
as trafficking with the enemy.

40:24.759 --> 40:26.219
The enemy? How?

40:26.695 --> 40:28.130
Don't touch that!

40:28.632 --> 40:31.232
- What charges, man?
- Six in total.

40:31.268 --> 40:33.635
And they have been sent to Congress
and to General Washington.

40:33.670 --> 40:36.738
Charges of corruption, of impropriety,

40:37.016 --> 40:38.608
and perhaps worse.

40:39.152 --> 40:41.319
Since those charges are lies,

40:41.354 --> 40:43.321
I will assume that you have
no evidence to back up

40:43.356 --> 40:45.256
this slander that I will
see you charged with.

40:45.480 --> 40:46.980
What is that?

40:47.015 --> 40:49.516
An anonymous letter sent
by a concerned Patriot

40:49.551 --> 40:53.653
led us to your nest
of schemes and bad business.

40:53.688 --> 40:54.964
Anonymous?

40:56.124 --> 40:59.425
I will fight these charges
to the bitter end.

40:59.461 --> 41:02.573
- Man: <i> All done, sir.</i>
- I will see you there.

41:07.068 --> 41:09.002
<i>(door opens)</i>

41:28.142 --> 41:29.252
Benedict...

41:31.276 --> 41:32.876
are these things true?

41:34.179 --> 41:35.068
No.

41:35.681 --> 41:37.948
They are the attacks
of an anonymous coward

41:37.983 --> 41:40.220
<i>who thinks he can hide</i>
<i>behind a disgrace like Reed.</i>

41:42.588 --> 41:45.922
No, this will go away by morning.

41:47.551 --> 41:51.286
In the meantime, I think it best
that you return home for tonight.

42:04.742 --> 42:06.809
-<i> (bird warbling)</i>

42:32.203 --> 42:34.436

42:37.136 --> 42:38.480
<i>(knock at door)</i>

42:39.570 --> 42:41.038

42:41.073 --> 42:42.553
Richard: <i>I'm afraid I must.</i>

42:53.147 --> 42:55.047
Oh, Richard.

43:00.626 --> 43:02.600
I heard about Corporal Eastin.

43:03.904 --> 43:06.766
I don't know how he's done it
with his Rangers deployed,

43:06.802 --> 43:10.770
but Simcoe has somehow managed to
strike a double blow against me.

43:11.940 --> 43:13.406
<i>I suppose it is the perfect alibi.</i>

43:13.441 --> 43:14.328
What do you mean?

43:14.976 --> 43:17.823
Not only has he killed
another one of my men,

43:18.180 --> 43:20.847
but now he has apparently poisoned

43:20.882 --> 43:22.703
Major André's trust with me.

43:23.420 --> 43:25.399
His letter from New York indicates

43:25.435 --> 43:27.702
that he is not interested
in hearing what intelligence

43:27.737 --> 43:30.085
Abraham has gathered
about the Sons of Liberty.

43:31.051 --> 43:33.051
Perhaps it's for the best
