WEBVTT

00:03.220 --> 00:04.745
Are you ready
to admit it, Xander?

00:04.780 --> 00:06.363
We are not lost.

00:06.398 --> 00:07.539
We're exploring.

00:09.410 --> 00:10.792
For five hours?

00:12.304 --> 00:15.146
In complete circles?

00:15.182 --> 00:16.798
I'd know exactly where we are

00:16.834 --> 00:18.608
if Jorge hadn't eaten our map.

00:18.644 --> 00:21.678
Again, I thought
it was a candy wrapper.

00:21.714 --> 00:23.847
Again, that doesn't explain it.

00:25.692 --> 00:28.360
Hey, look, a cabin.

00:28.395 --> 00:29.919
Maybe there's someone
who can help us

00:29.955 --> 00:30.955
not die out here.

00:34.410 --> 00:36.551
Wow, look at all these signs.

00:36.587 --> 00:37.961
"No trespassing."

00:37.996 --> 00:39.646
"Seriously, go away."

00:39.681 --> 00:42.766
"What are you
still doing here?"

00:42.801 --> 00:44.826
Guys, I can lead us
back to camp.

00:44.862 --> 00:46.520
Trust me.
(SNICKERS)

00:46.555 --> 00:48.864
You lost my trust
four hours ago.

00:48.899 --> 00:50.139
(JORGE GIGGLING)

00:52.135 --> 00:54.177
(KNOCKING)

00:54.212 --> 00:55.646
MAN: No one's home!
Go away!

00:55.681 --> 00:57.697
Great, no one's home.

00:57.733 --> 00:58.733
Now what do we do?

01:00.895 --> 01:03.478
Uh, sir, we were just
hoping for some directions

01:03.513 --> 01:05.355
back to Camp Kikiwaka.

01:05.391 --> 01:06.473
Or Manhattan!

01:09.069 --> 01:12.037
Ugh, kids.

01:12.073 --> 01:14.033
That's it. I'm putting up
a barbed wire fence.

01:15.576 --> 01:17.717
Sorry for bothering you, sir.

01:17.752 --> 01:18.827
We'll go back
to our fun exploring.

01:18.862 --> 01:22.122
We're hopelessly lost.

01:22.157 --> 01:23.757
And in desperate need of water.

01:23.792 --> 01:25.642
With ice.

01:25.677 --> 01:27.578
And if you could throw in
some fruit wedges,

01:27.613 --> 01:28.613
that'd be great.

01:30.682 --> 01:31.940
You can drink from the hose

01:31.975 --> 01:33.466
if you promise
to get out of here.

01:33.501 --> 01:35.735
Your camp's that way.

01:35.770 --> 01:37.763
There's a 70-foot cliff
over there.

01:37.798 --> 01:39.318
(CHUCKLES)
So, you caught me.

01:39.349 --> 01:40.349
It's the other way.

01:42.861 --> 01:44.903
<i>¶ Here we go</i>

01:44.939 --> 01:47.956
<i>¶ We're leaving the city
behind right now</i>

01:47.991 --> 01:49.591
<i>¶ Let's gather by
the campfire light</i>

01:49.626 --> 01:51.410
<i>¶ And sing this song</i>

01:51.445 --> 01:54.954
ALL: <i> ¶ Kikiwaka</i>

01:54.990 --> 01:57.190
<i>¶ Hanging out with someone new</i>

01:57.225 --> 01:59.968
<i>¶ Then falling out
of a camp canoe</i>

02:00.003 --> 02:01.962
<i>¶ What's that smell?
It's on your shoe</i>

02:01.997 --> 02:03.280
ALL: <i> ¶ Kikiwaka</i>

02:04.708 --> 02:07.258
<i>¶ Got a s'more in my hair</i>

02:07.294 --> 02:09.953
<i>¶ Mosquitos in our underwear</i>

02:09.988 --> 02:11.388
<i>¶ Shower's broke
but we don't care</i>

02:11.423 --> 02:14.449
ALL: <i> ¶ Kikiwaka</i>

02:14.484 --> 02:19.204
<i>¶ This is our home away</i>
<i>from home away from</i>
<i>home away from home</i>

02:19.240 --> 02:22.682
<i>¶ But watch your back
A bear just ate my phone</i>

02:22.717 --> 02:25.185
ALL: <i> ¶ Kikiwaka, Kikiwaka</i>

02:25.220 --> 02:27.554
ALL: <i> ¶ Kikiwaka, Kikiwaka</i>

02:27.590 --> 02:30.473
ALL: <i> ¶ Kikiwaka, Kikiwaka ¶</i>

02:40.652 --> 02:42.911
Okay, remember,
the wax cools quickly,

02:42.946 --> 02:44.696
so you have to apply it
while it's warm.

02:44.732 --> 02:47.106
Then press on the tearing paper,

02:47.142 --> 02:49.451
and gently pull away
that unsightly leg fuzz.

02:51.213 --> 02:52.662
(SCREAMS)

02:55.817 --> 02:57.737
That's the price
of beauty, girls.

02:58.846 --> 02:59.502
How are the girls doing
with the candle making?

03:00.447 --> 03:02.080
Candles?

03:02.115 --> 03:04.282
Right.

03:04.317 --> 03:07.469
Do not put that wax
on your legs.

03:07.504 --> 03:10.556
Hey, ladies,
notice anything
different about me?

03:10.591 --> 03:12.323
You got taller?

03:12.359 --> 03:15.110
No. Holding steady
at five-foot-four.

03:15.145 --> 03:17.846
Okay, five-foot-three.

03:17.881 --> 03:20.507
But I was speaking
of these gloves

03:20.542 --> 03:23.359
that Xander got me for the
counselor-CIT gift exchange.

03:23.395 --> 03:24.636
Oh, now you can hit a tetherball

03:24.671 --> 03:25.871
without bursting into tears.

03:26.431 --> 03:28.014
Exactly.

03:28.049 --> 03:29.929
And save my tears
for when I lose.

03:33.021 --> 03:35.188
I can't believe I forgot
the gift exchange.

03:35.223 --> 03:36.965
It's how counselors
and their CITs

03:37.000 --> 03:38.541
show their appreciation
for each other.

03:38.577 --> 03:39.943
Well, then let's do it.

03:39.978 --> 03:42.662
(GASPS) I know exactly
what I'm getting you.

03:42.698 --> 03:44.723
And so the gift really comes
from the heart,

03:44.758 --> 03:47.233
I say we can't spend any money.

03:47.269 --> 03:48.909
I have no idea
what I'm getting you.

03:52.650 --> 03:55.349
Okay, we're hydrated
and we know where we're going.

03:55.385 --> 03:56.618
Let's head back to camp.

03:56.653 --> 03:57.769
Wrong way, Magellan.

03:59.706 --> 04:02.146
Guys, I have to go
to the bathroom.

04:02.150 --> 04:03.892
Pick a tree. Any tree.

04:03.927 --> 04:06.453
No way.
I need privacy.

04:06.488 --> 04:08.313
I can't go unless I'm alone.

04:08.348 --> 04:09.508
In a locked room

04:09.541 --> 04:12.142
with the lights off.

04:12.177 --> 04:14.097
That explains the mess
in our cabin bathroom.

04:14.613 --> 04:16.338
I can't hold it.

04:16.340 --> 04:18.580
I have to ask that old man
if I can use his potty.

04:19.034 --> 04:20.034
Jorge.

04:22.688 --> 04:24.479
What now?

04:24.515 --> 04:26.148
I hope the light's off
in your bathroom

04:26.183 --> 04:27.303
cause I'm goin' in.

04:31.004 --> 04:33.229
I hate to intrude,
but that's my camper.

04:33.264 --> 04:35.423
Mind if I wait for him inside?

04:35.459 --> 04:38.142
Fine, but he'd better not
touch my decorative soaps.

04:38.178 --> 04:39.738
It's Jorge.
Your soap is safe.

04:43.566 --> 04:45.200
So... New to
the neighborhood?

04:45.235 --> 04:46.193
I can show you around.

04:46.228 --> 04:47.428
No, he can't.

04:50.557 --> 04:52.232
What are you doing
in these parts?

04:52.267 --> 04:54.860
Trying to avoid
annoying children.

04:54.895 --> 04:56.077
It's not going very well.

04:57.556 --> 04:58.796
Hurry it up, Jorge!

05:00.951 --> 05:02.271
Why are you staring at me, kid?

05:03.862 --> 05:05.294
What did you do in there?

05:05.330 --> 05:08.114
Nothing.
We'll be leaving now.

05:08.149 --> 05:09.909
The door's right behind you.
I know.

05:11.861 --> 05:14.696
Guys, I have something
to tell you

05:14.731 --> 05:16.873
about that old man.

05:16.908 --> 05:18.566
Anything you learned
about him in the bathroom,

05:18.601 --> 05:19.841
I do not want to know.

05:21.497 --> 05:24.589
He is Santa Claus.

05:24.625 --> 05:26.958
What? See, Jorge,

05:26.994 --> 05:28.459
this is why we don't eat maps.

05:28.495 --> 05:30.335
That ink is messing
with your brain.

05:33.191 --> 05:36.918
Hey, Ravi, look what
I'm making for Lou.

05:36.953 --> 05:40.589
A picture frame
decorated with rocks.

05:40.624 --> 05:41.898
Why not just throw
some ugly pine needles

05:41.933 --> 05:43.093
on it, while you are at it?

05:47.021 --> 05:49.272
You don't think
Lou will like it?

05:49.308 --> 05:51.658
Listen, this is between
you and Lou.

05:51.693 --> 05:52.959
So, if you wish to give her

05:52.994 --> 05:55.203
that sloppy tchotchke, so be it.

05:55.238 --> 05:58.248
Hmm. You are really good
at giving presents.

05:58.283 --> 05:59.566
I mean, that personal
makeup artist

05:59.601 --> 06:00.681
you got me is amazing.

06:01.878 --> 06:03.970
Oh. Thanks, Tania.

06:04.005 --> 06:05.125
I was feeling a tad shiny.

06:08.051 --> 06:09.726
Okay, so forget the frame.

06:09.761 --> 06:11.261
What should I give to Lou?

06:11.296 --> 06:14.555
Since you asked,
as the gift master,

06:14.590 --> 06:16.558
I say, think more personal.

06:16.593 --> 06:19.144
Ask yourself,
"What makes Lou, Lou?"

06:19.179 --> 06:20.962
Well, she loves
being a Woodchuck.

06:20.998 --> 06:22.672
That is it.

06:22.707 --> 06:24.049
You should get her a woodchuck.

06:24.084 --> 06:27.794
Ka-blam.
Gift idea domination.

06:27.829 --> 06:29.846
You really think
Lou wants a live animal?

06:29.881 --> 06:31.121
Certainly more than a dead one.

06:32.642 --> 06:33.517
Trust me.

06:33.552 --> 06:36.536
Plus, I saw a woodchuck
burrowing in the Great Lawn.

06:36.571 --> 06:38.238
Just catch it
and slap a bow on it.

06:38.273 --> 06:39.780
I hope you're right.

06:39.816 --> 06:41.283
I really want Lou to love it.

06:41.318 --> 06:43.175
Of course she will.

06:43.211 --> 06:45.445
When have I ever been wrong
about a gift?

06:45.480 --> 06:46.654
Hmm, what about
that time you got Luke

06:46.689 --> 06:48.423
that giant dictionary?

06:48.458 --> 06:48.690
He just kept hitting you
in the head with it.

06:50.009 --> 06:52.260
But he loved it.

06:52.295 --> 06:54.095
I saw him smiling
right before I blacked out.

07:00.028 --> 07:01.994
You have to believe me.

07:02.030 --> 07:05.148
That guy is Santa Claus.

07:05.183 --> 07:07.300
If that miserable,
kid-hater is Santa Claus,

07:07.335 --> 07:08.455
I'm one of his reindeer.

07:09.746 --> 07:11.129
I'm telling you.

07:11.165 --> 07:13.223
When I came out of the bathroom,

07:13.258 --> 07:15.324
I made a wrong turn and...
XANDER: See?

07:15.359 --> 07:16.519
Everyone makes wrong turns.

07:19.172 --> 07:22.924
And I saw a really long list
of names and addresses.

07:22.959 --> 07:24.834
That's probably
his address book.

07:24.869 --> 07:26.829
Old people write things
down on paper.

07:28.064 --> 07:30.573
I also saw a Santa hat.

07:30.608 --> 07:33.143
So, what?
I have a Yankee hat.

07:33.178 --> 07:35.018
That doesn't make me
Derek Jeter.

07:35.963 --> 07:38.123
Okay, then explain the plate

07:38.158 --> 07:39.874
of cookies and glass of milk.

07:39.909 --> 07:42.093
Who, other than Santa,

07:42.129 --> 07:43.729
has cookies and milk
in his bathroom?

07:45.490 --> 07:46.490
You.

07:48.944 --> 07:52.629
Point taken. But that guy
really is Santa.

07:53.640 --> 07:55.432
Who cares?

07:55.509 --> 07:57.909
Santa hasn't given me
one present in eleven years,

07:57.944 --> 08:00.561
because I never made it onto

08:00.597 --> 08:02.957
his "Had a Paper Published In
an Ivy League Journal" list.

08:04.834 --> 08:05.834
What?

08:08.129 --> 08:09.612
I'm pretty sure his lists

08:09.647 --> 08:10.807
are just "Naughty"
and "Nice."

08:11.616 --> 08:13.958
Seriously?

08:13.993 --> 08:17.495
You mean, Santa holds me
to a higher standard
than everyone else?

08:17.531 --> 08:18.788
What a jerk.

08:18.823 --> 08:22.133
Guys, I would love to believe
that the real Santa

08:22.169 --> 08:23.289
is somewhere over that hill.

08:24.045 --> 08:25.285
Or was it that hill?

08:27.148 --> 08:28.931
Either way, it's not him.

08:28.967 --> 08:31.234
Yeah. That old guy
is just some loner

08:31.269 --> 08:32.911
who we'll probably
have to describe

08:32.946 --> 08:34.626
in detail to detectives someday.

08:37.892 --> 08:40.643
Tiff, that is Santa.

08:40.678 --> 08:45.915
And tomorrow, I'm going back
to his cabin to get off his
Naughty list for good.

08:45.950 --> 08:47.041
I'm coming with you
to have a word

08:47.076 --> 08:49.877
with that elf-loving freak.

08:49.913 --> 08:52.397
He owes me presents
for eleven years' worth
of nice behavior.

08:53.925 --> 08:55.045
Out of my way, pipsqueak!

08:57.470 --> 08:58.470
Okay, ten years.

09:05.703 --> 09:06.753
(POPS CAP OFF BOTTLE)

09:06.788 --> 09:07.903
Hey, Ravi.
(GASPING)

09:07.939 --> 09:09.859
Did you just open
that ginger ale
all by yourself?

09:09.875 --> 09:11.399
(CHUCKLING)

09:11.434 --> 09:13.314
Yes. Why do you think
I'm sweating?

09:15.021 --> 09:16.529
Well, I'm off to go
crush these petals

09:16.564 --> 09:18.456
to make perfume for Emma
for the gift exchange.

09:18.491 --> 09:19.651
Perfume? (SCOFFS)

09:20.435 --> 09:22.193
For Emma?

09:22.229 --> 09:24.120
Well, since it is none
of my business,

09:24.155 --> 09:25.995
I will not mention
that it is a horrible idea.

09:27.801 --> 09:29.459
Why?

09:29.494 --> 09:31.969
She already has
tons of perfumes.

09:32.005 --> 09:33.838
She even has two perfumes
named after her,

09:33.873 --> 09:36.132
Emma no. 5
and Emma no. 7.

09:36.167 --> 09:37.900
What happened to Emma no. 6?

09:37.936 --> 09:39.385
Testing did not go well.

09:39.420 --> 09:40.762
It did not harm the bunnies,

09:40.797 --> 09:43.256
but the children
were not so lucky.

09:43.292 --> 09:45.491
Good. I hate the thought
of animals suffering.

09:47.921 --> 09:49.929
So, do you know
what Emma would like?

09:49.965 --> 09:52.023
Since Emma can buy
whatever she wants,

09:52.058 --> 09:54.117
you have to give her
an experience.

09:54.152 --> 09:56.352
Why are you not
writing this down?

09:56.755 --> 09:58.237
An experience?

09:58.272 --> 10:00.640
Oh, like taking her
to a pig race?

10:00.675 --> 10:02.992
Well, Emma is not big on pigs.

10:03.028 --> 10:05.936
She loves culture.

10:05.972 --> 10:08.292
There's nothin' more cultured
than a pig in a racin' bib.

10:09.659 --> 10:10.899
Yes, yes, there is.

10:10.918 --> 10:12.143
Like...

10:12.178 --> 10:13.418
Well, anything.

10:14.505 --> 10:16.330
I think you should perform

10:16.366 --> 10:18.925
an interpretive dance
to slam poetry.

10:18.960 --> 10:20.159
But I don't know
about that stuff.

10:20.194 --> 10:22.554
I'm just a country girl.

10:22.589 --> 10:24.505
Then I will have to help you
release your inner dancer,

10:24.541 --> 10:26.981
find your poetry voice,
and lend you a leotard.

10:29.045 --> 10:30.853
All righty, I'm in.

10:30.888 --> 10:33.514
Let's do this.
(GASPING) High five!

10:33.549 --> 10:36.149
Oh, and since I'm wearing
my gloves, feel free
to really let loose.

10:36.803 --> 10:38.043
(SHUDDERS)

10:40.632 --> 10:42.156
Hey!

10:42.191 --> 10:44.476
What are you doing in here?

10:44.511 --> 10:46.951
(GASPS) And why are
you wearing my tie?

10:47.947 --> 10:50.556
I'm just here to tell you,
I've been very good.

10:50.591 --> 10:53.543
Like yesterday,
I ate half a carrot cake,

10:53.578 --> 10:55.645
so I'm making strides
on the vegetable thing.

10:57.024 --> 10:59.090
Don't care.

10:59.125 --> 11:01.401
And I haven't farted
on Ravi's pillow in weeks.

11:02.612 --> 11:03.612
Okay, days.

11:04.773 --> 11:06.723
So, I did it yesterday,

11:06.758 --> 11:10.168
but only because he wouldn't
let me finish the carrot cake.

11:10.203 --> 11:11.577
Kid, you have problems.

11:13.415 --> 11:15.490
Okay, my turn.

11:15.525 --> 11:17.008
All my life I've been overlooked

11:17.043 --> 11:18.651
on the present front.

11:18.686 --> 11:20.536
I'm sure it was
some clerical error

11:20.572 --> 11:22.332
and I see no reason
to get lawyers involved.

11:23.375 --> 11:25.132
Both of you quit your babbling,

11:25.167 --> 11:27.218
and march your butts
off of my property!

11:27.254 --> 11:30.062
Come on, you can drop the act.

11:30.097 --> 11:31.931
We're big fans, Santa.

11:33.059 --> 11:34.250
What did you call me?

11:34.286 --> 11:36.244
Sorry. Mr. Claus.

11:36.279 --> 11:37.996
What? Huh?

11:38.031 --> 11:39.848
I'm not Santa Claus.

11:39.883 --> 11:40.857
I'm just an old man
whose patience

11:40.892 --> 11:43.526
is dwindling faster than his
social security checks.

11:46.982 --> 11:48.606
So much for being jolly.

11:48.642 --> 11:50.402
He must be crashing
after all those cookies.

11:55.290 --> 11:57.982
(CHITTERING)

11:58.017 --> 12:01.052
Ah, I see
the woodchuck hunt is on.

12:01.087 --> 12:02.807
Can I offer you
a thickly-gloved hand?

12:04.407 --> 12:06.565
No, thanks.
It shouldn't take long

12:06.601 --> 12:08.509
to outsmart this
pea-brained rodent.
(CHUCKLES)

12:08.545 --> 12:09.545
(THUMPS)
(SQUEAKING)

12:10.329 --> 12:12.055
Oh, see?

12:12.090 --> 12:13.090
Piece of cake.

12:16.928 --> 12:18.311
Is it an invisible cake?

12:19.622 --> 12:21.255
Darn it!

12:21.290 --> 12:24.108
Okay, so he got one carrot.

12:24.144 --> 12:25.868
I have a whole crate of carrots.

12:25.903 --> 12:27.343
(RAVI CHUCKLES)
(WOODCHUCK SQUEAKING)

12:28.173 --> 12:29.739
Uh, chucked again.

12:31.284 --> 12:33.151
Pea-brained rodent, two.

12:33.186 --> 12:34.306
Pea-brained blonde, zero.

12:34.337 --> 12:35.928
(CHUCKLES)

12:35.963 --> 12:37.663
(HISSING)

12:39.359 --> 12:42.543
Emma, what are you doing?

12:42.578 --> 12:44.658
I'm putting a garden snake
into this hole

12:44.664 --> 12:46.704
to scare the woodchuck
out of this hole.

12:48.727 --> 12:50.843
Ah! Who's the pea brain,
now, wood-punk?

12:52.497 --> 12:54.657
(HISSING)
(SCREAMING)

12:55.792 --> 12:57.391
Get it off! Get it off me!

12:58.203 --> 12:59.644
(GRUNTS)

13:01.380 --> 13:03.247
What...

13:03.283 --> 13:05.363
Hey, that swing
did not hurt at all.

13:06.244 --> 13:07.276
Speak for yourself.

13:10.415 --> 13:11.655
Oh, what did the nurse say?

13:12.625 --> 13:14.466
(SHRIEKS)

13:14.502 --> 13:16.010
Does my cheek
really look that bad?

13:16.045 --> 13:19.279
Define bad.

13:19.315 --> 13:20.973
Well, I guess Lou's
not getting her present.

13:21.009 --> 13:22.925
That genius woodchuck
kicked my butt.

13:22.961 --> 13:24.919
(CHITTERING)

13:28.283 --> 13:30.383
Well, that genius
just walked into the cage.

13:30.418 --> 13:32.117
(CHUCKLING) Ha!

13:32.153 --> 13:33.244
I own you, Chucky!

13:33.280 --> 13:34.762
(HISSES)
(GASPS)

13:34.798 --> 13:36.438
I mean, we cool, we cool.

13:36.474 --> 13:37.714
(CHITTERING)

13:41.446 --> 13:43.686
If you're really
not Santa, prove it.

13:45.333 --> 13:47.867
Jorge, Tiffany, I told you
to leave this poor man alone.

13:47.902 --> 13:49.018
I've been asking them to leave

13:49.053 --> 13:50.495
for three hours straight.

13:50.530 --> 13:52.130
Well, with a couple
of cookie breaks.

13:53.617 --> 13:55.275
Yeah, sorry.

13:55.310 --> 13:56.550
We would have been here sooner,

13:56.569 --> 13:58.077
but, you know, this one.

14:01.308 --> 14:03.123
I apologize, sir.

14:03.159 --> 14:04.400
For some strange reason,

14:04.435 --> 14:05.642
they've convinced themselves

14:05.678 --> 14:07.269
you're Santa Claus.
(CHUCKLES)

14:07.305 --> 14:09.597
Hey, if I had a magic sleigh,

14:09.632 --> 14:12.483
I'd be flying over
Halle Berry's house.

14:12.519 --> 14:15.010
Come on, if you're
really not Santa,

14:15.046 --> 14:17.279
explain all the cookies.

14:17.315 --> 14:19.740
So I don't always make
the best dietary choices.

14:19.776 --> 14:21.456
Who are you, my cardiologist?

14:23.638 --> 14:26.105
Then you're really not Santa?

14:26.141 --> 14:29.601
No! So scram!
Back to your camp!

14:29.636 --> 14:31.752
Better yet,
take Mr. Carrot Cake

14:31.788 --> 14:34.505
all the way back to Denver,
where he came from.

14:34.541 --> 14:37.199
Wait, how'd you know
I'm from Denver?

14:37.977 --> 14:41.078
Uh...

14:41.113 --> 14:42.914
You must have mentioned it
in all of your yapping.

14:42.949 --> 14:44.590
No, he didn't.

14:44.625 --> 14:45.716
I didn't even know
he was from Denver.

14:45.752 --> 14:47.643
Me, either.

14:47.679 --> 14:50.437
Any chance you'd believe
it was a lucky guess?

14:50.473 --> 14:52.840
You knew because
you are Santa Claus!

14:53.843 --> 14:55.617
Not exactly.

14:55.653 --> 14:57.470
I was Santa Claus.

14:57.505 --> 14:59.397
But not anymore.

14:59.432 --> 15:00.556
I'm done with Christmas.

15:06.430 --> 15:09.632
Santa, what do you mean
you're done with Christmas?

15:09.667 --> 15:12.601
The world doesn't
need me anymore.

15:12.637 --> 15:15.171
These days you go online,
and with a click of a mouse,

15:15.206 --> 15:18.707
a delivery man in short pants
drops a toy at your door.

15:18.743 --> 15:21.460
We probably shouldn't mention
the same-day delivery drones.

15:21.496 --> 15:23.921
I wouldn't.

15:23.957 --> 15:28.158
So kids can get toys
without me flying
around the world,

15:28.194 --> 15:31.971
busting my hump,
defying the laws of physics.

15:32.006 --> 15:33.923
But...
But, nothing.

15:33.958 --> 15:36.078
My pulmonologist says
I'm this close to black lung.

15:38.338 --> 15:40.612
So I'm done going down chimneys,

15:40.648 --> 15:42.573
and I'm done
with this conversation.

15:42.608 --> 15:44.350
Now get out of here.

15:44.385 --> 15:45.677
Come on, guys.

15:45.712 --> 15:48.954
And Xander,
try using that compass

15:48.990 --> 15:51.741
I left under your tree
three years ago.

15:51.776 --> 15:53.693
I would, but I can't find it.

15:58.983 --> 16:00.708
I can't believe Santa has lost

16:00.743 --> 16:02.284
his Christmas spirit.

16:02.320 --> 16:04.462
We have to do something.

16:04.497 --> 16:05.997
I know how we can help Santa.

16:06.032 --> 16:08.457
Find him a dietitian?
Introduce him to Halle Berry?

16:10.077 --> 16:11.661
No.

16:11.696 --> 16:15.564
Santa thinks
he just brings presents,

16:15.600 --> 16:17.633
but he brings more than that,

16:17.669 --> 16:20.578
more than any delivery man can.

16:20.613 --> 16:21.988
And I know how
to prove it to him,

16:22.023 --> 16:24.315
and save Christmas!

16:24.392 --> 16:27.168
Great. Tell us
on the way back to camp.
Yeah.

16:27.203 --> 16:28.744
And to guide us,
we'll just follow
the North Star.

16:28.779 --> 16:29.779
That's an airplane.

16:35.002 --> 16:35.710
No need to help, Ravi.
(WOODCHUCK CHITTERING)

16:35.745 --> 16:36.745
I got it.

16:38.456 --> 16:40.873
(WOODCHUCK HISSING)

16:40.950 --> 16:44.426
I would help, but I gave
my gloves to Mrs. Kipling.

16:44.462 --> 16:47.930
Why?
Because she wanted them.

16:47.965 --> 16:50.965
So I had to choose
between fingerless gloves
or fingerless hands.

16:51.669 --> 16:53.544
Where's Lou?

16:53.579 --> 16:54.612
I can't wait to give
this woodchuck to her.

16:54.647 --> 16:56.289
(WOODCHUCK CHITTERING
AND HISSING)

16:56.324 --> 16:57.999
Listen, pal,
if you don't cool it,

16:58.034 --> 16:59.154
Lou's getting a fur coat!

16:59.176 --> 17:01.493
(WOODCHUCK CHITTERING)

17:01.529 --> 17:03.804
All in good time.

17:03.839 --> 17:06.673
Lou wants to give you
her present first.

17:06.709 --> 17:11.312
I present to you
a performance piece
called <i> Emma.</i>

17:11.347 --> 17:13.022
(MUSIC PLAYING)

17:16.961 --> 17:20.613
This sapphire-eyed
personification

17:20.648 --> 17:23.824
of the aesthetic ideal
the universe birthed upon us.

17:26.137 --> 17:28.696
Wind. Rain. Fire.

17:28.731 --> 17:29.731
Emma.

17:32.167 --> 17:33.834
Ravi, what is she doing?

17:35.496 --> 17:36.954
Giving you an experience

17:36.989 --> 17:38.589
you will never forget.
(CHUCKLES)

17:38.891 --> 17:39.891
I'll say.

17:42.469 --> 17:45.095
Alien to these woods,

17:45.131 --> 17:47.251
she took like a fish to water.

17:48.568 --> 17:51.752
Like a bird to air.

17:51.787 --> 17:54.772
Like a flying fish
to air or water.

17:58.111 --> 17:59.944
Before Emma,

17:59.979 --> 18:01.803
I was a tea pot.

18:01.839 --> 18:05.549
So short. So stout.

18:05.585 --> 18:07.318
Caught in a desperate
spiral of hopelessness...

18:07.353 --> 18:08.393
Oops!

18:10.515 --> 18:12.873
But then... Emma.

18:17.997 --> 18:19.471
Profound, Lou!

18:19.506 --> 18:21.281
Absolutely breathtaking!

18:21.317 --> 18:23.650
(LAUGHS)

18:23.686 --> 18:25.726
So, Emma, what'd
you think of your gift?

18:26.464 --> 18:29.732
I'm speechless.

18:29.767 --> 18:30.927
Because you loved it so much?

18:31.877 --> 18:33.910
Yeah, let's go with that.

18:33.946 --> 18:35.146
How about you open your gift?

18:40.128 --> 18:41.128
(GASPS)

18:42.363 --> 18:44.822
Wow, you got me a cage

18:45.949 --> 18:48.275
with poop. (CHUCKLES)

18:48.311 --> 18:50.461
No! There was a woodchuck
in there making that poop.

18:50.496 --> 18:51.721
That was your present.

18:51.756 --> 18:53.647
Oh, well, thank you,

18:53.682 --> 18:55.140
but I don't think that'd be

18:55.176 --> 18:56.908
the best thing
to keep in the cabin.

18:56.944 --> 18:59.104
I mean, they have been known
to carry rabies.

19:02.884 --> 19:03.966
I should have just gone
with that picture frame
I was making you.

19:04.001 --> 19:05.684
(SCOFFS) Lame.

19:05.719 --> 19:07.979
I would've loved that.

19:08.014 --> 19:10.534
I was making
a perfume for you.
Lamer.

19:12.451 --> 19:15.502
But Ravi said that
you liked interpretive dance

19:15.537 --> 19:17.638
because you went
to all of his shows.

19:17.673 --> 19:20.113
I only went because
Mom always bought me
a diamond afterwards.

19:21.561 --> 19:23.969
That is hurtful.

19:24.004 --> 19:26.480
I should channel
my pain into a poem.

19:26.515 --> 19:28.032
I am out

19:28.067 --> 19:29.416
like the wind.

19:29.452 --> 19:31.952
(BLABBERING)

19:34.657 --> 19:36.966
Lou, seeing how much
work you put into
that poem and dance,

19:37.001 --> 19:39.001
shows just how much
you care about me.

19:39.036 --> 19:40.503
And that makes it
a really great present.

19:40.538 --> 19:41.645
So, thank you.

19:41.681 --> 19:43.531
(GASPS) And you chasing around

19:43.566 --> 19:45.799
a possibly rabid woodchuck
means a lot to me.

19:46.986 --> 19:48.026
Thank you.

19:51.149 --> 19:53.031
Well, I guess we've learned,
sometimes the gift

19:53.067 --> 19:54.692
isn't really
about the actual present.

19:54.727 --> 19:57.008
And that we should
never listen to Ravi.

20:00.675 --> 20:04.218
Oh, no. Santa put up
an electrified fence.

20:04.253 --> 20:07.421
Don't worry, I have a plan.

20:07.457 --> 20:09.106
We just have to climb
twenty feet up that tree,

20:09.141 --> 20:10.899
shimmy across that branch,

20:10.935 --> 20:12.793
then swing ourselves
over the barbed wire.

20:12.828 --> 20:14.078
Or, we could do this.

20:19.168 --> 20:21.168
Okay, if you want to take
all the fun out of it.

20:25.066 --> 20:26.849
All right, now we just have
to scale that rain gutter,

20:26.884 --> 20:28.233
traverse the roofline,

20:28.269 --> 20:29.418
then slither down the chimney,

20:29.453 --> 20:31.270
while holding our breath.

20:31.347 --> 20:33.347
That way, we don't inhale
any toxic carcinogens.

20:35.393 --> 20:37.518
Or, we could use the key
under his "Go Away" mat.

20:43.509 --> 20:46.084
It's not my problem
you're all out of jobs.

20:46.120 --> 20:48.503
Can't you go make
cookies and trees?

20:48.539 --> 20:50.739
Or get gigs
as Oompa Loompas,
or somethin'?

20:52.768 --> 20:53.951
Whoa.

20:55.838 --> 20:57.321
Presents?

20:57.356 --> 20:58.964
For me?

20:59.000 --> 21:00.040
But... How?

21:02.386 --> 21:03.627
(LAUGHING)

21:05.806 --> 21:07.256
ALL: Merry Christmas!

21:08.651 --> 21:10.317
You guys did this?

21:10.353 --> 21:12.819
Yup.
It was all Jorge's idea.

21:12.855 --> 21:15.347
I realized you're the only one

21:15.382 --> 21:18.358
who has never felt the magic
of Christmas morning.

21:18.393 --> 21:21.712
Well, not the only one.

21:21.748 --> 21:27.151
So we wanted to give you
the same special feeling
you give us every year.

21:27.186 --> 21:29.106
You were wrong.
The world does need you.

21:29.497 --> 21:31.205
JORGE: You're Santa.

21:31.240 --> 21:33.424
You don't just bring kids toys,

21:33.459 --> 21:35.784
you bring kids joy.

21:35.820 --> 21:37.060
No one else can do what you do.

21:37.821 --> 21:39.655
Wow.

21:39.690 --> 21:41.448
I'm not used to kids showing me

21:41.483 --> 21:42.933
the meanin' of Christmas.

21:42.968 --> 21:44.268
Thank you.

21:44.303 --> 21:46.320
(LAUGHING)

21:46.355 --> 21:48.673
Santa is back
in the Santa business.

21:48.708 --> 21:50.983
(ALL CHEERING)

21:51.018 --> 21:53.511
And you guys are definitely
at the top of the Nice list!

21:53.546 --> 21:55.287
What about me?

21:55.322 --> 21:56.822
Will I finally be getting
a present this year?

21:56.857 --> 21:59.041
This year?

21:59.076 --> 22:00.876
I've given you presents
every year.

22:01.111 --> 22:02.644
You have?

22:02.680 --> 22:05.013
But I've never made it onto your

22:05.049 --> 22:07.808
"Had a Paper Published In
an Ivy League Journal" list.

22:07.843 --> 22:09.276
Yeah, that's not a thing.

22:12.123 --> 22:13.797
And your mother's
on the Naughty List

22:13.833 --> 22:15.607
for lying to you
and hiding your gifts.

22:15.642 --> 22:16.700
Mother!

22:19.371 --> 22:21.254
I just have one favor
to ask you guys.

22:21.290 --> 22:23.098
Okay, okay.

22:23.134 --> 22:25.484
I'll stop farting
on Ravi's pillow.

22:25.519 --> 22:26.710
Not that, that's hilarious.

22:28.989 --> 22:31.365
Not a word about this to anyone.

22:31.400 --> 22:33.167
Because the whole
cranky Santa thing

22:33.202 --> 22:35.736
would be bad for your rep?

22:35.771 --> 22:38.572
That, and I don't want
Mrs. Claus knowing
I have a summer place.

22:38.607 --> 22:40.907
(CHUCKLES)

22:40.943 --> 22:42.150
Hey, what are you doing
standing around talking?

22:42.185 --> 22:43.735
Open your dang presents.

22:43.771 --> 22:44.771
Ho, ho, ho!

22:45.823 --> 22:47.732
Let's see. (LAUGHS)

22:47.767 --> 22:50.567
Ah. Eh, socks.

22:56.575 --> 22:57.716
Who wants more popcorn?

22:57.751 --> 22:59.001
ALL: I do!

22:59.036 --> 23:01.094
(WOODCHUCK CHITTERING)

23:01.130 --> 23:02.330
Dang, that woodchuck is good.

23:02.740 --> 23:05.032
(BELLS JINGLING)

23:05.067 --> 23:07.543
Hey, does anyone else hear

23:07.578 --> 23:08.578
sleigh bells?

23:10.406 --> 23:11.880
As a matter of fact, I do.

23:12.917 --> 23:14.550
From up there.

23:14.585 --> 23:16.952
Oh.

23:16.987 --> 23:19.137
Did you guys just see that?

23:19.173 --> 23:21.039
Was that what I thought it was?

23:21.074 --> 23:22.391
Yep, it was a shooting star.

23:24.161 --> 23:25.310
SANTA: Ho, ho, ho!

23:27.189 --> 23:32.993
With a sense of humor.
