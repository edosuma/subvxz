00:01.560 --> 00:03.410
(honking)

00:03.562 --> 00:06.005
(truck beeping)

00:12.847 --> 00:15.514
(breathing heavily)

00:16.333 --> 00:18.075
- Come on, come on, come on!

00:18.093 --> 00:21.411
- The baby... The baby...
- You'll be fine.

00:21.430 --> 00:23.171
Hey, hey, hey. The baby's fine.

00:23.190 --> 00:25.357
Nothing will happen
to the baby. It's okay.

00:25.509 --> 00:27.084
It's gonna be fine.
(honking)

00:27.086 --> 00:30.696
- It looks just like you.
So handsome.

00:30.773 --> 00:32.698
So handsome...

00:37.596 --> 00:39.747
(mumbling)

00:41.709 --> 00:44.960
- Babe. I need you
to listen to me, okay?

00:46.105 --> 00:48.714
It's gonna be okay.
Listen to me.

00:48.865 --> 00:50.549
No matter what happens...

00:51.460 --> 00:53.277
No matter what happens,
I love you.

00:53.295 --> 00:55.203
I need you to know that.

00:55.281 --> 00:57.347
I love you, okay?

01:00.469 --> 01:03.896
Now hang on.
(tires screeching)

01:04.047 --> 01:06.315
(screaming)

01:11.555 --> 01:13.146
(screaming)

01:13.299 --> 01:15.282
(man): Somebody,
get some help!

01:16.577 --> 01:19.119
(indistinct chatter)

01:24.143 --> 01:25.959
- Miss, can you hear me?

01:32.793 --> 01:35.052
(indistinct chatter)

01:54.022 --> 01:55.322
(bird chirping)

01:56.508 --> 01:57.950
(Keith): You thought
I was an imposter.

01:58.026 --> 02:00.510
(Jason): No, we didn't.
- Sid did.

02:00.529 --> 02:02.770
- She just remembers you
differently.

02:02.848 --> 02:03.956
- I remember her differently,

02:04.032 --> 02:06.608
but I don't see you making her
take a DNA test.

02:06.627 --> 02:09.202
- Okay, bud, we shouldn't have
tested you.

02:09.355 --> 02:12.706
It was my fault, and I'm sorry.

02:12.782 --> 02:15.450
But you passed, and it's over.

02:15.527 --> 02:17.619
- For you guys, not for Sidney.

02:17.713 --> 02:20.530
- You remember that necklace
you made her at camp?

02:21.367 --> 02:23.884
She's worn it every night
since you were taken,

02:24.036 --> 02:26.703
and she touches it,
sometimes without even noticing.

02:27.665 --> 02:32.042
It's her touchstone, baby.
You're her touchstone.

02:33.136 --> 02:35.970
- I can't believe you called in
an anonymous tip.

02:36.048 --> 02:39.324
- It's him. They found Keith.

02:40.569 --> 02:42.386
- Are you gonna tell
your parents?

02:42.388 --> 02:44.997
- No. They won't believe me.

02:45.073 --> 02:47.374
Not until there's proof
that the bones are...

02:48.410 --> 02:49.984
That that's all that's
left of him.

02:50.062 --> 02:55.048
- If that's Keith, then who is
the psycho living in his room?

02:59.496 --> 03:01.430
(tense music)

03:06.929 --> 03:10.747
- She's still out there.
The person that took me.

03:10.766 --> 03:12.782
Do you know how that feels?

03:13.268 --> 03:16.278
Constantly looking
over my shoulder...

03:18.699 --> 03:20.866
I just don't like being doubted.

03:21.017 --> 03:23.160
Not after what
I've been through.

03:24.763 --> 03:27.289
(alarm blaring)

03:29.025 --> 03:31.192
Whoever that is,
when you find them,

03:31.270 --> 03:33.545
I hope their families
don't make them take a DNA test.

03:33.697 --> 03:35.121
- Baby!

03:35.198 --> 03:37.090
(alarm blaring)

03:52.382 --> 03:54.474
- His name is Miguel Salgado.

03:54.568 --> 03:56.142
37, no wife or children.

03:56.295 --> 03:59.796
He was reported missing
by his employer, Kids Care,

03:59.815 --> 04:04.058
it's a foster care agency.
They directed us to next of kin.

04:04.078 --> 04:06.078
- What do we know
about the brother?

04:06.305 --> 04:07.412
- Dr. Piraí Salgado.

04:07.581 --> 04:10.565
Only that he is the patron
saint of global health.

04:10.567 --> 04:12.400
Started a foundation
that set up clinics

04:12.478 --> 04:16.646
that save thousands of people
in Rwanda, Haiti, and Brazil.

04:16.740 --> 04:19.508
- My brother and I are
the last of the Mohicans.

04:20.261 --> 04:21.909
Or in our case, the Juma.

04:21.929 --> 04:27.507
He and I are all that is left
of our culture, our language.

04:27.659 --> 04:31.161
Unfortunately,
our experience isn't unique.

04:31.163 --> 04:33.179
Of the 7,000 indigenous
languages,

04:33.332 --> 04:36.500
four out of ten
are in danger of disappearing.

04:36.593 --> 04:39.152
Two die out every month.

04:40.614 --> 04:44.616
As foundation interns,
your job is to imagine new ways

04:44.768 --> 04:47.344
to stem this tragic tide.

04:47.346 --> 04:48.528
As for my brother,

04:48.680 --> 04:51.364
most of you know
he has been reported missing.

04:52.184 --> 04:54.793
These fine people are here
to help locate him.

04:54.962 --> 04:59.706
Until they do,
please keep him and them

04:59.858 --> 05:01.633
in your hopes and prayers.

05:02.303 --> 05:03.969
Thank you.

05:05.139 --> 05:07.197
- Tell us about Miguel.

05:07.716 --> 05:09.533
- You know what he does
for a living.

05:09.551 --> 05:10.884
The stress of his job.

05:10.960 --> 05:12.477
- We know that he works
in foster care.

05:12.629 --> 05:16.297
Are you saying that...
that his job has something

05:16.375 --> 05:18.132
to do with his disappearance?
- Perhaps.

05:18.152 --> 05:23.488
He sometimes testifies
against unfit parents
who could target him.

05:23.681 --> 05:25.824
- Well, missing
doesn't mean taken.

05:25.901 --> 05:28.068
Sometimes, people just... go.

05:28.162 --> 05:30.996
- Was he running
from something? Was he unhappy?

05:31.073 --> 05:32.389
(phone ringing)

05:33.316 --> 05:35.742
<i> (Nikki): Hey.</i>
- Hey. Mailman sent a video.

05:35.819 --> 05:37.077
I just texted it to you.

05:37.229 --> 05:39.412
I don't have
the police report yet,

05:39.489 --> 05:42.490
but the car matched
to a city impound.

05:42.509 --> 05:43.825
- Get to Kids Care.

05:43.844 --> 05:45.919
See if anyone
can identify that woman.

05:45.995 --> 05:46.753
<i> - Okay.</i>

05:47.406 --> 05:48.755
- Is it Miguel,
did you find him?

05:48.849 --> 05:52.333
- You guys, get to city impound
and check out Miguel's car.

05:52.427 --> 05:55.595
This is a bit... disturbing.
- Okay.

05:55.672 --> 05:56.763
(clears throat)

05:57.265 --> 05:58.482
(people shouting)

06:01.269 --> 06:03.678
- Do you recognize that woman?

06:03.697 --> 06:05.530
- I have never seen her before.

06:06.367 --> 06:09.034
- Okay, well, Piraí, sit tight.

06:09.185 --> 06:12.019
- The answer to the question
is no. He isn't unhappy.

06:12.097 --> 06:16.282
- Well, maybe not.
But someone's clearly
unhappy with him.

06:16.693 --> 06:18.952
- Blood on the passenger side.

06:19.028 --> 06:23.123
Video footage of our guy running
away from the scene, right?

06:23.199 --> 06:25.700
- You know, I got a call
from Bill Houston today.

06:25.777 --> 06:27.869
- Oh yeah?
- Apparently, he's not a fan.

06:27.888 --> 06:30.222
- Well, I take great joy
in that.

06:30.298 --> 06:32.039
(chuckling)
- He's the chief of detectives

06:32.059 --> 06:34.208
and he was calling
about a status update.

06:34.228 --> 06:36.377
Normally that's a Nikki call,

06:36.397 --> 06:38.138
but he thought I would be
more objective.

06:38.214 --> 06:40.140
- Oh yeah? Were you?

06:40.216 --> 06:42.125
- If you know where to look,

06:42.144 --> 06:43.551
you could find out
anything about a car.

06:43.629 --> 06:45.720
Where it's been, when the doors
have been opened.

06:45.797 --> 06:48.407
People, that's harder to map.

06:49.243 --> 06:51.317
- Yeah. Is that a yes or a no?

06:51.394 --> 06:53.895
- He's not a fan because
before you went to Afghanistan,

06:53.914 --> 06:57.157
you had more code violations
than anybody in the department.

06:57.233 --> 07:00.143
You didn't follow the rules,
stay in your lane.

07:00.162 --> 07:02.028
- My lane?
- Yeah.

07:02.180 --> 07:03.404
He was hoping this time around,

07:03.482 --> 07:04.814
you could do
a little more of that.

07:04.833 --> 07:07.092
And I'm not gonna lie,
I was hoping the same thing.

07:07.169 --> 07:10.411
You know, maybe not shoot out
car windows, pull warrants...

07:10.505 --> 07:12.989
- I pulled a warrant... once.

07:12.991 --> 07:14.766
- I know it's not your style,

07:14.843 --> 07:17.752
but lanes are important.
They provide clarity.

07:17.771 --> 07:20.330
- Maybe people are hard
to map in general, but me,

07:20.332 --> 07:23.333
not so much, okay? I say what
I think and I do what I say.

07:23.351 --> 07:26.019
Alright, I am
a cartographer's dream.

07:26.113 --> 07:28.521
I didn't violate
any of my own codes,

07:28.598 --> 07:30.765
just Bill Houston's,
you understand?

07:31.618 --> 07:33.693
- Hey, Nik.
I pulled the last location

07:33.787 --> 07:37.030
Miguel put in MapFinder.
I think I know where he is.

07:37.182 --> 07:39.040
(indistinct chatter)

07:46.041 --> 07:47.716
- Sorry, sir.

07:49.194 --> 07:51.386
Kemi, what's going on?

07:52.698 --> 07:53.972
- Uh...
- What is it?

07:54.049 --> 07:57.058
- Uh, nothing.
I got you, I got you.

07:59.646 --> 08:01.980
- There he is, over there.

08:02.632 --> 08:03.982
Hey.

08:04.726 --> 08:06.943
Miguel Salgado, right?

08:07.713 --> 08:09.379
Well, I'm Nikki Batista.

08:09.898 --> 08:12.306
MPU.
- I have nothing to say to you.

08:12.326 --> 08:15.685
- Your brother... your brother
is very worried about you,

08:15.687 --> 08:18.038
and we're just here to help.

08:19.983 --> 08:22.392
We're here to help, that's all.

08:22.410 --> 08:24.227
(chuckling)

08:24.229 --> 08:25.837
- You can't help.

08:25.914 --> 08:27.897
- You don't know that, right?

08:27.899 --> 08:30.400
- No one can.
- Miguel.

08:30.418 --> 08:33.261
(gasping)
(people screaming)

08:34.998 --> 08:36.014
Miguel.

08:36.132 --> 08:37.407
Look at me.

08:37.425 --> 08:38.850
You don't have to do this, okay?

08:39.002 --> 08:41.520
- No, but it's worse if I don't.
(honking)

08:41.522 --> 08:43.188
- Give me your hand,
give me your hand.

08:43.265 --> 08:44.839
- Train!
- Give me your hand!

08:44.858 --> 08:45.915
Give me your hand!

08:45.934 --> 08:48.401
- Tell Shane... I'm sorry.
- Train!

08:48.511 --> 08:50.529
- Let me help you, okay?
Give me your--

08:50.605 --> 08:52.088
(honking)

08:52.090 --> 08:53.657
(thudding)

08:58.930 --> 09:01.781
- So you just jumped
on the tracks with a train
coming at you?

09:01.933 --> 09:03.858
- You think Shane
was the woman in the car?

09:03.877 --> 09:05.451
- You just leapt in
after Miguel, huh?

09:05.546 --> 09:07.437
- Makes sense why he was
asking for forgiveness.

09:07.530 --> 09:10.698
- Our job was to find Miguel,
and we did.

09:10.776 --> 09:13.276
Unfortunately, we couldn't
save him, so...

09:13.295 --> 09:16.388
as far as we're concerned,
the case is closed.

09:16.464 --> 09:20.708
- I'm not so sure. I searched
Miguel's office at Kids Care,

09:20.727 --> 09:23.136
and this was in his notes.

09:23.897 --> 09:26.714
This is Shane Weems,
missing two years.

09:26.792 --> 09:29.459
Taken in San Francisco.
SFPD has no leads,

09:29.477 --> 09:32.053
so she is still missing,
and we have a new case.

09:32.072 --> 09:35.240
- Okay, so Miguel has
a baby with a missing woman,

09:35.391 --> 09:38.301
then he crashes his car,
then runs. Why?

09:38.303 --> 09:40.227
- Kemi, call the ERs,

09:40.229 --> 09:42.414
find out which one
our missing woman is at.

09:42.490 --> 09:44.841
You guys, I think the answer
to this riddle

09:44.843 --> 09:46.901
could be in his files
or his laptop.

09:46.920 --> 09:48.253
Pull a warrant and find out.

09:48.404 --> 09:50.088
Meanwhile, I'm gonna
go see Salgado,

09:50.239 --> 09:52.090
give him the news and find out
why he doesn't recognize

09:52.167 --> 09:55.302
the woman that his brother
had a child with.

09:56.822 --> 09:58.671
Hey, uh, Kemi.
- Yeah?

09:58.748 --> 10:00.581
- At the station, what happened?

10:00.659 --> 10:03.602
- Oh, uh...
It was nothing. Yeah.

10:03.753 --> 10:04.844
- Didn't look like nothing.

10:04.996 --> 10:07.680
- I thought I saw someone
who is dead.

10:07.833 --> 10:09.274
I mean, obviously I didn't.

10:09.425 --> 10:12.093
- Why do you say that?
You believe in reincarnation.

10:12.112 --> 10:14.595
- Yeah, and karma,
and if this guy's still alive,

10:14.615 --> 10:20.026
then mine is unbearably bad,
and it's not. So he's not.

10:20.103 --> 10:22.954
So, like I said, it was,
um, it was nothing, yeah?

10:23.073 --> 10:24.180
- Okay.

10:24.774 --> 10:26.440
- Your resume is
very impressive.

10:26.460 --> 10:28.460
The foundation is lucky
to have you.

10:28.611 --> 10:30.962
- Oh, no, trust me,
I'm the lucky one.

10:31.114 --> 10:33.280
I mean, what you do...

10:33.375 --> 10:37.969
I don't want to sound too much
like a fangirl, but I am in awe.

10:38.121 --> 10:39.879
- But it is I who is
in awe of you.

10:39.956 --> 10:44.309
I'm honored you decided
to join me in building
a better future.

10:44.386 --> 10:46.645
- Would it bother you
if part of the reason I'm here

10:46.796 --> 10:49.873
is to do penance for the way
my family's business

10:49.891 --> 10:52.208
contributes to deforestation?

10:52.210 --> 10:54.377
- Not at all.

10:54.379 --> 11:00.200
Given your pedigree, I find your
commitment even more impressive.

11:01.386 --> 11:03.236
Can I let you in on a secret?

11:03.312 --> 11:05.405
A secret place, actually.

11:05.557 --> 11:08.667
A farm where people live the
life we are supposed to live.

11:08.818 --> 11:12.837
Plant what our people planted.
Sing their songs.

11:12.914 --> 11:14.580
The foundation carries
the message,

11:14.733 --> 11:17.417
but the message is put
into practice at the farm.

11:17.493 --> 11:19.493
- That sounds like
an amazing place.

11:19.571 --> 11:21.404
- Oh, it is.

11:21.423 --> 11:25.850
What it needs is amazing people.
People like you.

11:25.927 --> 11:27.835
- Whatever I can do.
I'll do anything.

11:27.854 --> 11:31.338
- Great. I will arrange to have
someone pick you up later today.

11:31.416 --> 11:32.691
- Okay.
- Thank you.

11:32.800 --> 11:34.192
- Thank you.

11:36.697 --> 11:38.363
- Thank you.

11:40.701 --> 11:42.775
Mr. Salgado.

11:42.852 --> 11:45.161
- Did you find him?
Is he alright?

11:46.264 --> 11:48.281
- No, baby, he's...

11:48.767 --> 11:50.166
He's not alright.

11:50.936 --> 11:52.335
He took his own life.

11:52.787 --> 11:54.254
I'm sorry.

11:55.198 --> 11:56.881
- I don't understand.

11:57.033 --> 11:59.700
- Of course not. How could you?

11:59.720 --> 12:03.430
But there are questions
that might help get you
to understand.

12:04.966 --> 12:06.799
I wouldn't be asking right now

12:06.952 --> 12:09.561
if I didn't think the answers
might save someone's life.

12:09.563 --> 12:11.855
- Someone's, not Miguel's.

12:12.958 --> 12:15.567
- The woman from
the car accident,

12:15.718 --> 12:17.310
her name is Shane Weems.

12:17.921 --> 12:21.740
And we think that she and Miguel
had a child together.

12:21.933 --> 12:23.816
And you said you didn't
recognize her.

12:24.727 --> 12:27.328
Is there anything you want
to add to that?

12:28.231 --> 12:32.083
- No, I'm sorry. I had no idea.

12:33.311 --> 12:38.405
Truth is, my brother and I had
a falling out about a year ago.

12:38.833 --> 12:39.924
Until then, we'd been partners

12:40.001 --> 12:42.302
in trying to preserve
our legacy.

12:42.837 --> 12:44.411
Splitting up was tough.

12:44.839 --> 12:46.931
- Is there anyone
that you can call?

12:47.008 --> 12:49.976
A friend who can be with you?

12:52.088 --> 12:53.354
What is that?

12:54.641 --> 12:56.983
- A symbol of my ancestors.

12:57.778 --> 13:00.069
Miguel and I were the last.

13:01.022 --> 13:02.522
Now I'm alone.

13:02.674 --> 13:05.742
Yes, I have a friend.

13:07.862 --> 13:09.370
- You should call him.

13:11.291 --> 13:14.183
- I will. Please,
close the door on your way out.

13:14.185 --> 13:15.685
I'd like to be alone.

13:16.612 --> 13:21.633
- If you need anything, call me.
I'm available day or night.

13:34.797 --> 13:37.190
- You're not going
to believe this.

13:38.226 --> 13:40.634
Miguel, he killed himself.

13:40.654 --> 13:42.654
- You sound upset.

13:42.805 --> 13:44.305
- He was my brother.

13:44.324 --> 13:45.639
<i> - He was your problem.</i>

13:45.659 --> 13:48.885
Half of it, anyway.
Shane's the other half.

13:48.903 --> 13:50.311
<i> - The police were asking</i>
<i> about her.</i>

13:50.330 --> 13:52.831
- Yeah, ambulance picked her up
after the accident,

13:52.907 --> 13:54.481
brought her to county.

13:54.576 --> 13:55.908
- I have a new recruit,

13:56.061 --> 13:58.895
and I'm about to put
a package into the system.

13:58.897 --> 14:00.505
<i> If Shane talks before that...</i>

14:00.656 --> 14:02.090
- She won't.

14:03.176 --> 14:05.093
She won't talk at all.

14:18.266 --> 14:20.449
- So we executed a warrant
on Miguel's laptop.

14:20.451 --> 14:22.768
So, as I'm going through it,
he logs on.

14:22.845 --> 14:24.437
- Who?
- Miguel.

14:24.531 --> 14:26.606
- Miguel's dead.
- That is correct.

14:26.758 --> 14:29.775
- So, this form can only
be accessed and authorized

14:29.928 --> 14:32.762
by someone who has
a Kids Care access code.

14:32.764 --> 14:36.933
27 minutes ago, Miguel's code
was used to place

14:36.951 --> 14:38.935
a one-month-old baby
into foster care.

14:38.937 --> 14:40.620
- Used by who?
- We don't know.

14:40.696 --> 14:43.106
They used a VPN, no IP address.

14:43.199 --> 14:46.626
- What information we did get
was on the one-month-old.

14:46.702 --> 14:48.628
So, it looks legit on its face.

14:48.704 --> 14:51.948
Date of birth, place of birth,
biological parents.

14:52.041 --> 14:53.892
But when you dig
a little bit deeper,

14:54.043 --> 14:55.376
it's clear that it's a facade.

14:55.395 --> 14:57.453
The kid's birth parents
don't exist.

14:57.455 --> 14:59.138
- And they're not
the only ones who don't.

14:59.215 --> 15:01.140
The 75 kids who were placed
in foster care

15:01.217 --> 15:03.960
through that account, a total
of nine had ghost parents.

15:03.962 --> 15:05.403
- What did Kids Care
say about that?

15:05.630 --> 15:07.221
- They were just
as surprised as us.

15:07.240 --> 15:08.981
- So, what are we thinking?

15:09.058 --> 15:10.816
For profit, black-market
adoption ring? What?

15:10.969 --> 15:12.485
- I mean, that's as good
a theory as any.

15:12.637 --> 15:14.579
The foster care system
is constantly placing

15:14.656 --> 15:16.822
unwanted and abused kids.

15:16.899 --> 15:18.307
It's a perfect way
to launder them.

15:18.401 --> 15:19.992
- Okay, we don't know where
the children came from,

15:20.145 --> 15:22.403
but we do know the foster homes
that they were placed.

15:22.422 --> 15:24.255
If they were essentially sold,

15:24.407 --> 15:26.332
then we need to do
a DNA swab. Okay?

15:26.409 --> 15:28.575
Figure out if they match any of
the kids who had gone missing.

15:28.653 --> 15:31.245
- Okay, you guys get a court
order to swab them.

15:31.264 --> 15:32.838
Kemi, tell C to run the samples.

15:32.933 --> 15:35.658
- I'm sorry, what did you say?

15:36.327 --> 15:38.010
- Nothing. Nothing, I got it.

15:38.087 --> 15:41.013
A John Doe has been pulled
from the river.

15:41.090 --> 15:43.499
The M.E. sent it here
for C to ID.

15:43.501 --> 15:44.943
I need to check in
with him about it.

15:45.094 --> 15:47.186
Hey, we have nine
unidentified children.

15:47.263 --> 15:50.173
Whatever didn't happen
at that train station

15:50.175 --> 15:51.674
is clearly weighing on you.

15:51.693 --> 15:53.843
But I need you to focus.
- I got you.

15:53.861 --> 15:56.179
- Hey, how are you?

15:56.181 --> 15:58.030
I'm C. I'm a Virgo.

15:58.183 --> 16:00.032
Modestly superstitious.

16:00.109 --> 16:03.777
A vegan, but with a weakness
for ossobuco.

16:04.464 --> 16:08.782
You and I are gonna be spending
a lot of time together, so,

16:08.802 --> 16:11.618
I hope you like topiary,
because I have been listening

16:11.638 --> 16:17.291
to the most amazing podcast
about this man who turns
boxwoods into baboons.

16:17.368 --> 16:18.868
It's sickening.
(chuckling)

16:18.870 --> 16:22.872
Hi! Come in, we're just getting
to know each other.

16:22.890 --> 16:25.608
You know, small talk, role play.

16:26.894 --> 16:29.153
Why don't you introduce
yourself?

16:29.881 --> 16:31.472
- Introduce myself?

16:31.491 --> 16:34.659
- Yeah, I mean,
make them comfortable.

16:34.661 --> 16:39.480
Or him. Or her. That's
the thing, we don't know.

16:39.557 --> 16:40.481
- Hmm.

16:40.500 --> 16:42.074
- Imagine what that
must be like.

16:42.727 --> 16:47.296
<i> (Nikki): To walk through</i>
<i> the world without anyone</i>
<i> knowing who you are.</i>

16:48.824 --> 16:50.842
- We're gonna get in
so much trouble for this.

16:50.918 --> 16:53.085
- Us? He's the one
who ditched math.

16:53.179 --> 16:54.920
- Yeah, and we ditched
English to follow him.

16:54.997 --> 16:58.074
- Look, we know who he isn't,
but who he is, we have no idea.

16:58.076 --> 17:01.244
And all I've done
to protect myself is put
a flimsy lock on my door.

17:01.262 --> 17:03.003
- Your parents are cops.

17:03.023 --> 17:06.983
- Yeah, but they're also
clueless. Check it.

17:07.769 --> 17:09.585
- Isn't that Drew's house?

17:09.604 --> 17:11.937
That's boring.
I'm somehow disappointed.

17:12.590 --> 17:14.532
- I'm gonna zoom in.
- I don't care.

17:14.609 --> 17:18.594
I don't want to see him
getting wasted with his best
friend in Daddy's garage.

17:19.430 --> 17:22.782
- He's not getting wasted.
- Okay, watching TV then?

17:22.934 --> 17:23.875
Sid, this is a bust.

17:24.026 --> 17:25.451
We're gonna get
in trouble for nothing.

17:25.603 --> 17:27.170
- It's not nothing.

17:28.531 --> 17:29.863
- Is that...

17:30.366 --> 17:33.459
He's got a gun.
He's stealing a gun.

17:33.536 --> 17:35.720
Why? Why would he do--
- Let's go.

17:36.964 --> 17:39.949
<i>- Someone somewhere is grieving.</i>

17:39.967 --> 17:44.604
A mother, father, sibling...

17:45.973 --> 17:48.232
Their child is lost.

17:50.052 --> 17:52.904
We can't give them
what they want,

17:52.980 --> 17:54.980
but if we can identify
who this is,

17:55.057 --> 17:57.325
we can give them
the closure they need.

18:00.580 --> 18:03.748
- Hi. I'm Nikki.

18:08.496 --> 18:10.379
(tense music)

18:11.758 --> 18:13.073
- Excuse me.

18:13.334 --> 18:16.502
Hi, there was a young woman
brought in status post gunshot.

18:16.579 --> 18:17.820
I got her blood work.

18:17.913 --> 18:20.098
- ICU.
- Thank you.

18:21.159 --> 18:24.660
- How's it coming?
- Oof. Slow.

18:24.753 --> 18:26.253
It's no obvious
cause of death,

18:26.272 --> 18:29.849
and not much tissue to work with
for the facial reconstruction.

18:30.001 --> 18:31.442
- You want to take a break?

18:31.594 --> 18:34.428
- Why do I feel like this break
is going to double my workload?

18:34.447 --> 18:36.781
- Because you have uncanny
instincts?

18:36.858 --> 18:38.116
(chuckling)
- Okay.

18:38.343 --> 18:40.100
- I just sent you an image

18:40.120 --> 18:42.745
I pulled off of SEPTA
security cam.

18:45.458 --> 18:46.499
- Okay...

18:48.444 --> 18:49.535
(sighing)
Ex-boyfriend?

18:49.612 --> 18:51.354
- He's a little old
for my taste.

18:51.356 --> 18:54.540
- Didn't you date Ben Franklin?
- He wasn't old then.

18:55.360 --> 18:58.711
This guy was involved
in a 2005 child abduction,

18:58.787 --> 19:01.973
or at least I think he was,
which is why I need your help.

19:02.124 --> 19:04.350
- Age regression?
- I need to figure out

19:04.501 --> 19:06.369
what he looked like
18 years ago,

19:06.387 --> 19:08.663
see if he's a match
for my suspect.

19:08.739 --> 19:10.982
- I didn't realize we had
another cold case.

19:11.484 --> 19:12.984
- About that...

19:13.060 --> 19:15.636
Can we keep this
between you and me?

19:15.713 --> 19:18.898
- My mouth is agape,
but my lips are sealed.

19:19.050 --> 19:21.141
- Thank you.
- Speaking of jaw-dropping,

19:21.161 --> 19:23.736
the DNA swabs that you ordered
for those kids,

19:23.812 --> 19:25.571
these were the results.

19:25.723 --> 19:27.665
- Thank you.
- Uh-huh.

19:29.227 --> 19:32.503
- Wait a minute.
This can't be right.

19:33.898 --> 19:35.564
- So, the mothers are missing.

19:35.583 --> 19:40.419
- So, C entered the DNA
we collected into every
available database.

19:40.496 --> 19:43.239
Nine samples kicked back
nine matches,

19:43.257 --> 19:45.241
but not to the children.

19:45.259 --> 19:46.350
- It's to their mothers.

19:46.502 --> 19:48.502
Seven women,
including Shane Weems.

19:48.579 --> 19:50.429
- So, county hospital
got back to us,

19:50.506 --> 19:52.264
and they have
a gunshot wound victim

19:52.341 --> 19:55.084
who just got out of surgery,
who matches our Shane Weems.

19:55.102 --> 19:57.420
- Mike, Jay, you guys
find out what she knows.

19:57.438 --> 19:59.271
Shane vanished in San Francisco.

19:59.424 --> 20:02.349
Karen Spellman in Dallas.
Lucinda Wright in Denver.

20:02.427 --> 20:05.352
Elise Sutton in Chicago.
Contact the families.

20:05.430 --> 20:08.539
Find out what the connection is.
- I see a connection here.

20:08.691 --> 20:10.708
None of these kids are older
than two years old.

20:10.785 --> 20:12.768
- So?
- So that means

20:12.861 --> 20:16.956
that all of these women,
they got pregnant after
they disappeared.

20:17.108 --> 20:19.533
Which is awful,
but it probably means

20:19.627 --> 20:22.094
that Shane's not the only one
who's still alive.

20:27.452 --> 20:29.060
- Has Rosa given you the tour?

20:29.211 --> 20:33.231
- She has. It's...
It's like a utopia.

20:34.067 --> 20:35.458
- That's my dream.

20:36.218 --> 20:39.812
I hope seeing it in person
has made you even more excited

20:39.814 --> 20:42.222
about playing your part
in making this a reality.

20:42.300 --> 20:44.075
- It certainly has.

20:44.819 --> 20:46.786
- I am glad
to hear you say that.

20:47.488 --> 20:50.414
There is one more thing
I would like to show you.

20:51.567 --> 20:52.667
- Thanks.

20:57.090 --> 20:58.981
Um... What is this?

20:59.000 --> 21:00.967
- Your new accommodations.

21:01.502 --> 21:04.095
(tense music)

21:17.593 --> 21:18.734
- Hey, Shane.

21:20.113 --> 21:22.004
You know I've been looking
all over for you?

21:22.765 --> 21:25.024
I thought I was gonna have
to shoot you again,

21:25.118 --> 21:28.027
but turning off your ventilator
is way more civilized.

21:28.121 --> 21:29.412
(groaning)

21:30.623 --> 21:31.905
(beeping)

21:33.367 --> 21:35.793
- Oh. I didn't know she was
getting extubated so quickly.

21:36.020 --> 21:37.353
- Yeah. Poor thing.

21:37.355 --> 21:39.112
I blame the on-call
anesthesiologist.

21:39.132 --> 21:41.114
They never give
enough pain meds.

21:41.192 --> 21:42.949
Be a dear and just
give him a call for me?

21:43.027 --> 21:45.052
- Of course. I'll be right back.

21:46.288 --> 21:48.864
(Jason): Why can't we talk
to this person?

21:49.291 --> 21:50.457
- It's not that you can't talk
to Ms. Weems,

21:50.476 --> 21:52.125
it's that she can't talk to you.
She's intubated.

21:52.219 --> 21:54.979
- Can you page Dr. Crane?
Patient in 12 can't
manage her pain.

21:55.130 --> 21:56.981
- That's Shane Weems.
- It's the damn extubation.

21:57.058 --> 21:58.724
- There's been no order
to do that.

21:58.876 --> 21:59.966
- Where's room 12?

22:00.469 --> 22:02.987
Hey! Little help in here!
Get a doctor!

22:03.064 --> 22:05.714
Hey, you're gonna be okay, okay?
Get a doctor.

22:05.733 --> 22:07.116
(choking)

22:08.977 --> 22:12.663
- Hey! Hey, police. Hey! Hey!

22:15.484 --> 22:17.168
(tense music)

22:24.402 --> 22:25.426
(grunts)

22:41.527 --> 22:43.102
(grunting)

22:43.863 --> 22:46.346
- Oh, officer. I need your help.

22:46.366 --> 22:47.698
(grunts)

22:49.852 --> 22:51.017
That's close enough.

22:51.112 --> 22:53.112
- I'm only gonna say this once.
Drop the weapon.

22:53.264 --> 22:54.855
- Yeah, I gotta insist,
you go first.

22:55.282 --> 22:56.690
In fact, I'm gonna
count to three.

22:56.767 --> 22:59.451
If your gun's not on the ground,
I will shoot this man!

22:59.604 --> 23:01.212
- Then you will be dead
a second after that.

23:01.363 --> 23:02.863
- Yeah, and I'll be dead.

23:02.882 --> 23:04.382
- We know about
the missing women.

23:04.458 --> 23:05.941
- One...
- We know that they've been

23:05.960 --> 23:07.534
abducted and forced
to have children.

23:07.612 --> 23:09.035
- Two...

23:09.705 --> 23:11.296
- Alright, hey, okay, stop.

23:11.391 --> 23:13.724
- That's good, now put it
on the ground.

23:15.786 --> 23:18.229
That's right. Kick it away.

23:19.882 --> 23:22.291
To be clear, you know nothing!

23:22.384 --> 23:23.401
(gunshot)

23:23.552 --> 23:24.793
(screaming)

23:25.387 --> 23:28.030
- What the hell did you do?
I had it under control.

23:33.988 --> 23:36.488
You're a cop, okay?
Not a vigilante.

23:36.565 --> 23:38.582
There's rules,
there's lanes, okay?

23:38.734 --> 23:39.825
I thought we had this
conversation.

23:39.919 --> 23:42.235
- Truth be told,
it was more like a lecture.

23:42.313 --> 23:43.421
- You know what? I give up.

23:43.648 --> 23:45.147
You want to try to talk
some sense into him?

23:45.166 --> 23:46.740
- I do, and I will,
but about the rules,

23:46.759 --> 23:49.334
one of them is never give up
your firearm to a suspect

23:49.462 --> 23:52.838
in a hostage situation.
- That was a judgment call.

23:52.915 --> 23:54.490
He was gonna kill that officer.

23:54.583 --> 23:56.082
- Perhaps, but some rules
don't have exceptions.

23:56.160 --> 23:58.827
- Are you really coming down
on me for this? For what I did?

23:58.829 --> 24:00.587
- I said that I was going
to talk to Jason--

24:00.665 --> 24:02.589
- No, no, forget about him
and his actions.

24:02.608 --> 24:04.090
Let's talk about yours.

24:04.110 --> 24:06.593
- Mine?
- Yeah. The train station.

24:06.671 --> 24:09.095
How you jumped on the tracks,
how you barely got out in time.

24:09.173 --> 24:11.173
- I don't know what that has
to do with anything.

24:11.192 --> 24:12.933
We are talking about the rules,
the regulations--

24:13.010 --> 24:15.844
- No, no, we're saying things
about the rules and regulations,

24:15.846 --> 24:17.621
but what we're talking
about is us.

24:17.698 --> 24:19.623
- No, we're not.

24:19.700 --> 24:21.959
- Yeah, we're not. You're right.

24:22.520 --> 24:23.777
We're talking about
the two of you.

24:23.796 --> 24:25.779
- Maybe I should go.
- Go where? To Nicole's house?

24:25.856 --> 24:28.023
Because I haven't been there
since Keith got back.

24:28.042 --> 24:29.858
- That's what this is about?

24:29.860 --> 24:34.379
Baby... Yes, Jason has been
staying at the house, okay?

24:34.456 --> 24:35.881
We're parents.
He's Keith's father.

24:36.033 --> 24:38.701
- You know, you both think that
I should've taken the shot.

24:38.719 --> 24:41.053
You know he could've killed
that hostage, right?

24:41.129 --> 24:43.814
That if he takes that shot,
95 times out of 100,

24:43.966 --> 24:45.541
he does die, but you both think

24:45.559 --> 24:47.710
that I should've taken it
anyway. It's reckless.

24:47.728 --> 24:49.469
It puts people's lives at risk.

24:49.547 --> 24:52.047
That's what this is about,
being reckless.

24:52.049 --> 24:54.383
Jumping off bridges,
off balconies.

24:54.401 --> 24:56.476
Standing in front
of moving trains.

24:56.554 --> 24:58.812
Being proud that you
nearly shot a hostage.

24:58.831 --> 25:01.314
You know, you both behave
like you have nothing to lose

25:01.334 --> 25:02.649
because you've lost everything.

25:02.727 --> 25:05.318
- We did lose everything.
- But you got it back!

25:05.838 --> 25:08.747
Okay, I know that you have been
living with this wound, okay?

25:08.824 --> 25:13.177
And it's affected you. I get it.
But Keith is back. It's over.

25:13.328 --> 25:16.013
You know, you want to review
my behavior, fine.

25:16.164 --> 25:18.224
But you both need
to review yours as well.

25:22.930 --> 25:24.671
- About the missing women,

25:24.749 --> 25:27.191
I figured out how
they connect. Salgado.

25:27.342 --> 25:29.175
- Miguel?
- No, the brother.

25:29.195 --> 25:30.936
The patron saint.

25:31.888 --> 25:35.424
Lucinda Wright is a law student
at the University of Chicago.

25:35.426 --> 25:40.204
Salgado was a guest lecturer
at UFC School of Public Health.

25:40.281 --> 25:42.614
Then we have Karen Spellman,

25:42.691 --> 25:45.376
who is an analyst
at the Human Rights Watch.

25:45.452 --> 25:49.046
Salgado, he's a board member
at the Human Rights Watch.

25:49.197 --> 25:51.290
And lastly,
we have Elise Sutton,

25:51.442 --> 25:52.866
who is a Fulbright Scholar.

25:52.868 --> 25:55.886
Salgado sat on the committee
that hands them out.

25:55.963 --> 25:58.447
Wherever one of these
missing women were,

25:58.449 --> 26:00.132
Salgado was sure
to be there too.

26:00.226 --> 26:02.451
- That's a connection,
but not an explanation.

26:02.469 --> 26:06.063
I mean, there were plenty
of other women at these places
that he could've taken.

26:06.140 --> 26:09.958
Why abduct them?
- Because he blames them

26:09.960 --> 26:11.627
for what happened to his people.

26:11.720 --> 26:15.480
Alright, so this is
an article from 1992.
There was a massacre.

26:15.633 --> 26:19.985
The Juma were targeted
by wealthy people who wanted
to exploit the land.

26:20.062 --> 26:26.141
And then three years later,
the last female member
of the tribe died.

26:26.143 --> 26:27.993
So after half
a century of trying,

26:28.070 --> 26:30.479
the corporate genocide
is complete.

26:30.481 --> 26:32.981
- These women started going
missing three years ago.

26:32.983 --> 26:34.666
- Corporate genocide...

26:34.743 --> 26:38.411
- The government carried out
the attack on behalf

26:38.431 --> 26:40.413
of various corporate interests,

26:40.491 --> 26:43.508
including lumber,
coffee, and rubber.

26:43.661 --> 26:47.420
These missing women,
they're all heirs

26:47.498 --> 26:51.758
to private fortunes
from companies like lumber...

26:51.777 --> 26:53.669
- Coffee and rubber.
- Yep, yep.

26:53.687 --> 26:56.113
- So that's it, revenge.
He hurts the families

26:56.264 --> 26:58.765
who run the companies
that destroyed his.

26:58.784 --> 27:00.767
- But what about the kids?
Right, I mean,

27:00.845 --> 27:03.120
revenge is obviously part of it,
but that's not all of it.

27:03.271 --> 27:05.530
We gotta find Salgado.
- I don't care about Salgado.

27:05.683 --> 27:07.458
I care about getting
these women back, and right now,

27:07.609 --> 27:09.017
we have no idea how to do that.

27:09.019 --> 27:12.112
- The guy who came after Shane
Weems could've told us.

27:12.781 --> 27:15.466
- Maybe he still can.
- No, he can't. You killed him.

27:15.617 --> 27:17.542
- Well, that's just
a minor technicality.

27:17.695 --> 27:20.012
I'm sure we can still
get him to talk.

27:20.531 --> 27:21.805
(knocking)

27:21.957 --> 27:23.882
Gunshot victim from outside.

27:24.034 --> 27:25.033
- Yeah, the one he shot.

27:25.144 --> 27:28.312
- We need to see him
and his effects, please.

27:30.149 --> 27:32.691
Great. Now the body.

27:36.397 --> 27:39.231
His eyes, open 'em.
- Uh, no.

27:40.234 --> 27:43.719
- This is a bad man, okay?
Who works for an even worse man,

27:43.737 --> 27:46.555
who we may not be able
to find unless we can
unlock this phone,

27:46.573 --> 27:48.907
which can't happen
unless it recognizes him.

27:49.059 --> 27:52.077
Which also... Never mind.

27:52.229 --> 27:53.653
- Hey, you can't do that.

27:53.673 --> 27:55.822
- Yeah, I know, I get that
a lot. Mother, may I?

27:55.841 --> 27:59.718
- Oh, now you want my
permission. Yeah, go ahead.

28:01.830 --> 28:02.905
(camera clicking)

28:03.331 --> 28:06.666
- Great. Now we can talk.
Let's see what he has to say.

28:06.744 --> 28:09.228
(breathing deeply)

28:11.582 --> 28:13.006
<i> - Jatémame.</i>

28:13.083 --> 28:14.858
- It won't be long, Elise.

28:15.361 --> 28:17.085
Then you'll have done your part.

28:17.604 --> 28:19.588
And the world will be
a better place.

28:19.590 --> 28:21.407
(breathing deeply)

28:26.780 --> 28:30.523
- The guy I shot is Allen Miles.
His mother was from Kilgari.

28:30.601 --> 28:32.617
She contracted malaria
ten years ago,

28:32.694 --> 28:35.787
and her life was saved
at one of Salgado's clinics.

28:35.940 --> 28:37.548
- Oh, so what, killing people

28:37.699 --> 28:39.049
was his way of showing
his appreciation?

28:39.126 --> 28:40.384
- Or he was Salgado's enforcer.

28:40.611 --> 28:43.536
Kept everybody in line,
including Salgado's brother.

28:43.538 --> 28:45.872
- Alright, these are
hand-written letters

28:45.950 --> 28:48.892
from Shane Weems to Miguel
that we found on Miles' phone.

28:48.969 --> 28:50.728
- "We need to get out...

28:50.879 --> 28:52.212
We have to do this
for our family...

28:52.231 --> 28:54.806
Our baby deserves a life
outside these walls..."

28:54.900 --> 28:56.382
- They were in love.
They tried to escape.

28:56.460 --> 28:57.776
Miles shoots her
for her trouble,

28:57.886 --> 28:59.219
she starts to bleed out,
needs help,

28:59.313 --> 29:02.147
so Miguel crashes his car
in hopes that the cops come

29:02.299 --> 29:03.574
and evac her
to the emergency room.

29:03.801 --> 29:06.802
- This is all really great,
but it doesn't get us any closer

29:06.804 --> 29:08.394
to finding the other women.

29:08.489 --> 29:11.656
- No, but the photos
in the phone do.

29:12.734 --> 29:15.902
- Okay, forced labor
on some kind of farm.

29:15.904 --> 29:17.904
- Well, they destroyed
his way of life.

29:17.923 --> 29:19.572
Maybe he's using them
to recreate it.

29:19.650 --> 29:21.925
- So what the women
were forced to grow,

29:22.077 --> 29:26.764
his followers were more
than happy to sell at
a farmers' market.

29:27.491 --> 29:29.841
A lot of cities have
streets named Morro,

29:29.994 --> 29:32.828
but this particular color
of street sign

29:32.846 --> 29:35.088
and the Gaelic calligraphy font,

29:35.165 --> 29:36.589
this Morro
is in Tannersville,

29:36.609 --> 29:39.592
which also happens to have a
farmers' market every Thursday,

29:39.612 --> 29:42.020
which, every vendor
has to register

29:42.097 --> 29:44.264
in order to participate,
so naturally,

29:44.283 --> 29:46.116
I pulled every registration.

29:46.268 --> 29:51.121
Only one is a non-profit
with proceeds earmarked

29:51.273 --> 29:54.699
for the Amazon reforestation,
and I have their address.

29:54.776 --> 29:57.944
Yes, I am a badass.

29:58.705 --> 30:00.856
- Imagine how much more
amazing you would be

30:00.858 --> 30:02.448
if we had your full attention.

30:02.526 --> 30:05.544
Go, 30 seconds, and then
we're getting our babies back.

30:05.696 --> 30:06.470
Thank you.

30:07.473 --> 30:09.640
- I've completed the age
regression.

30:09.791 --> 30:12.309
- Okay, you realize that
literally everyone can see us.

30:12.386 --> 30:14.961
Literally everyone.
Why don't you say hello?
Because they are looking.

30:14.980 --> 30:20.133
- Okay, this being
on the down low, I just,
I'm not good at it, okay?

30:20.210 --> 30:21.209
- Clearly.

30:21.378 --> 30:24.154
- On the plus side,
I am great at this.

30:24.231 --> 30:26.156
Looks like your guy
had some work done.

30:26.308 --> 30:27.658
- Cosmetic surgery?

30:27.809 --> 30:30.052
- Yeah, chin augmentation and
a botched scalp reduction.

30:30.054 --> 30:34.498
I compensated for those
in the model, so...
let's see what we think.

30:34.649 --> 30:36.542
- Okay. Um...

30:37.911 --> 30:39.962
(ominous music)

30:41.656 --> 30:42.965
- Are you okay?

30:44.068 --> 30:46.718
You look like
you've seen a ghost.

30:49.515 --> 30:51.014
- Because I have.

30:51.517 --> 30:54.226
(tense music)

30:58.173 --> 31:00.724
- Put the guns down!
Put the guns down.

31:00.951 --> 31:02.192
That's right.

31:03.103 --> 31:05.937
We're Philly PD,
missing persons.

31:06.090 --> 31:08.256
We're gonna need you
to open that gate.

31:08.258 --> 31:10.108
- You got a warrant?
- Exigent circumstances.

31:10.260 --> 31:11.776
- What's that mean?
- It means we're coming in.

31:11.929 --> 31:14.613
On your knees, on your knees
right now. Both of you.

31:14.689 --> 31:16.689
Hands on top of your head.

31:17.284 --> 31:18.858
- We're moving in.
- Right behind you.

31:18.878 --> 31:20.360
- What the hell does
exigent mean?

31:20.379 --> 31:22.379
- Technically, it means
there's a crime being committed

31:22.530 --> 31:24.214
that justifies
a warrantless search,

31:24.291 --> 31:26.124
but I like what you said.

31:26.201 --> 31:28.302
(breathing heavily)

31:29.889 --> 31:32.614
(speaking in another language)

31:32.633 --> 31:34.057
- You need to step away.

31:34.134 --> 31:36.468
(gasping)
- The child is almost here.

31:36.620 --> 31:37.802
- I said step back.

31:37.897 --> 31:39.955
- I can't. Not from a miracle.

31:39.957 --> 31:41.123
- I'm not asking again.

31:41.141 --> 31:42.807
(Elise screaming)
- You won't have to.

31:42.960 --> 31:44.401
(screaming)

31:50.150 --> 31:51.967
(baby crying)

31:51.969 --> 31:54.319
Do not go gentle
into that good light.

31:54.396 --> 31:58.415
Old age should burn
and rave at close of day.

31:58.492 --> 32:01.126
Rage, rage against
the dying light.

32:02.663 --> 32:06.214
It's the light
in a world gone dark.

32:07.334 --> 32:08.592
- Go!

32:09.744 --> 32:11.345
Go on, we'll stay here.

32:22.608 --> 32:24.524
(suspenseful music)

32:30.432 --> 32:34.284
- Give her the child.
The baby, give her the baby.

32:35.955 --> 32:38.771
The others. Where are they?

32:38.849 --> 32:40.582
Where are the other women?

32:45.689 --> 32:47.172
(footsteps approaching)

32:48.467 --> 32:51.969
Oh, my God. Oh God.

32:52.863 --> 32:55.639
It's okay. It's okay.

32:56.200 --> 32:57.808
You are safe.

32:58.644 --> 33:03.730
You're going home.
You're going home. Okay?

33:05.300 --> 33:08.560
Come here. Come here.

33:08.654 --> 33:10.445
(suspenseful music)

33:13.400 --> 33:14.432
(Jason grunting)

33:14.493 --> 33:16.076
- Hey, Jay!

33:17.145 --> 33:18.996
Are you alright?

33:21.391 --> 33:22.416
Jay!

33:31.418 --> 33:33.468
I need you to put
that knife down.

33:40.077 --> 33:41.518
I need you to put
the knife down.

33:41.595 --> 33:43.020
- You know what
their families did.

33:43.138 --> 33:44.429
You wouldn't be here
if you didn't.

33:44.581 --> 33:47.566
- We can talk about it as soon
as you let him go, okay?

33:48.360 --> 33:49.584
- Don't!

33:49.586 --> 33:51.269
- I can't let you walk away,
you know that.

33:51.363 --> 33:53.530
- No lane, okay? Forget
the lane, screw the lane.

33:53.681 --> 33:58.443
- They burned the forest.
Shot and killed men,
women, and children.

33:58.520 --> 33:59.703
- Hey, do what you gotta do.

33:59.854 --> 34:02.039
You know what you need to do,
right? Just do it.

34:02.266 --> 34:03.598
- Yeah, I do.

34:03.658 --> 34:05.083
Hey, look.

34:06.545 --> 34:07.619
I'm putting it away.

34:08.288 --> 34:11.531
- They committed genocide!
- And you did the opposite.

34:11.608 --> 34:13.533
16,000...

34:14.053 --> 34:16.294
12,000. 1,400.
The amount of people

34:16.371 --> 34:20.039
that you saved from ringworm,
dehydration, diabetes.

34:20.117 --> 34:22.133
- He's great,
he's a real humanitarian.

34:22.210 --> 34:24.302
Just take out your gun, Mike,
take out your gun.

34:24.379 --> 34:27.230
- None of that matters.
None of that matters.

34:27.307 --> 34:29.140
- Hey, you are not a killer.

34:29.293 --> 34:31.810
You had Allen Miles
do that for you.

34:31.962 --> 34:35.313
- I'll do it.
- Tonight, I saw you.

34:35.390 --> 34:37.982
You know, what that meant
to you. That baby.

34:38.135 --> 34:40.726
What it meant to bring life
into the world.

34:40.746 --> 34:42.579
- I swear to God, one more step.

34:42.730 --> 34:44.764
- Life, not death.

34:45.325 --> 34:49.327
Okay, put the knife down. Easy.

34:49.904 --> 34:52.497
Easy, slow, slow.
Good. Take it.

34:52.574 --> 34:55.258
Knees on the ground.
Hands behind your back.

34:56.169 --> 34:58.578
You have the right
to remain silent.

34:58.655 --> 35:01.038
Anything you say
can and will be used...

35:01.116 --> 35:02.657
<i> (Nikki): Tell me about</i>
<i> the children.</i>

35:02.659 --> 35:06.269
- The children are my legacy.
- Mm-hmm.

35:06.346 --> 35:09.589
You were the father,
and you kidnapped the daughters

35:09.608 --> 35:11.349
of the families
who destroyed your tribe

35:11.501 --> 35:14.945
and then you used them
to bring your tribe back.

35:15.021 --> 35:16.596
- And when the time comes,

35:16.615 --> 35:18.673
I have arranged for them
to learn who they are,

35:18.692 --> 35:22.101
where they come from. Nothing
you can do will change that.

35:22.179 --> 35:24.788
- Let's talk about
what I can do, alright?

35:24.865 --> 35:26.772
<i> Which is charge you with rape.</i>

35:26.850 --> 35:29.517
<i> - I never touched those women.</i>

35:29.944 --> 35:31.795
Everything was done through IVF.

35:31.872 --> 35:35.448
- Like I said,
the charges are rape,

35:35.467 --> 35:38.117
kidnapping,
conspiracy to murder.

35:38.137 --> 35:40.137
- I deserve whatever I get,

35:40.288 --> 35:43.431
but not because
of what you think I did.

35:45.126 --> 35:47.435
Because of what I didn't do.

35:48.705 --> 35:50.230
- What didn't you do?

35:50.983 --> 35:53.507
- I hated it as a boy.

35:53.986 --> 35:57.154
It was so backwards.

35:58.473 --> 35:59.564
So I left.

36:00.217 --> 36:04.035
- And you grew up there, right?
With the Juma.

36:04.663 --> 36:06.221
- I walked away.

36:06.239 --> 36:09.124
I had more important
things to do.

36:10.227 --> 36:12.002
So I did them.

36:14.564 --> 36:17.424
What I didn't do
is save my family.

36:22.830 --> 36:24.239
- How's your neck?

36:24.257 --> 36:26.758
- Clean shaven.
How's your conscience?

36:26.910 --> 36:28.259
- He'll be tried for his crimes.

36:28.336 --> 36:30.245
The women he hurt will get
to see him punished.

36:30.263 --> 36:32.856
My conscience is clear.
- No, that's not what I meant.

36:32.933 --> 36:34.416
- I know that's not
what you meant.

36:34.434 --> 36:36.434
- I mean, he could've killed me.
- Yeah, but he didn't.

36:36.586 --> 36:39.103
- You put away your gun again.
- I went on his website.

36:39.239 --> 36:41.272
I checked out his foundation,
I did my homework.

36:41.349 --> 36:44.275
You should try it.
- Is that just a fancy way

36:44.369 --> 36:45.443
of saying that you stayed
in your lane?

36:45.595 --> 36:46.945
- Which was
the right thing to do.

36:47.039 --> 36:49.431
You want to know how I know
it was the right thing to do?

36:49.449 --> 36:50.782
- Mmm.
- 'Cause you're alive

36:50.876 --> 36:53.752
to bitch to me about it,
so, you know, you're welcome.

36:57.699 --> 37:00.550
- Hey. Thank you, brother.

37:00.702 --> 37:02.302
Thank you.

37:04.205 --> 37:05.347
(door closing)

37:06.800 --> 37:08.558
(soft music)

37:21.389 --> 37:22.572
- Hey.

37:32.993 --> 37:34.459
(knocking on door)

37:40.150 --> 37:45.095
- This case will fill up
your entire wall.

37:45.913 --> 37:48.765
- Seven women get reunited
with their nine children.

37:48.958 --> 37:51.893
I'd say it was a good day.
- Yes.

37:52.754 --> 37:54.086
But it could've been better.

37:54.106 --> 37:55.921
- Okay, if this is about
my behavior, Nikki--

37:55.923 --> 37:57.849
- No, not yours . Or Jason's.

37:57.925 --> 37:59.517
Even though he behaved badly.

37:59.669 --> 38:05.264
It's mine. It's about...
jumping off bridges,
in front of trains.

38:05.317 --> 38:08.451
- And balconies.
- And yes, balconies.

38:08.528 --> 38:10.528
- Fourth floor balconies.
- Right.

38:10.680 --> 38:12.772
- Into a little, tiny pool.
- You're not making it easy

38:12.791 --> 38:15.208
to apologize.
- Hey, hey.

38:16.295 --> 38:17.460
- Okay.

38:19.689 --> 38:21.214
- Apology accepted.

38:23.193 --> 38:26.044
- It's true. I can be reckless.

38:26.196 --> 38:29.639
And yes, it started
when Keith went missing,

38:29.716 --> 38:33.626
and now he's back,
and it should stop, right?

38:33.645 --> 38:36.962
And yes, I know that
you accepted my apology,

38:36.982 --> 38:40.375
but I'm not just here
to apologize,

38:40.393 --> 38:42.910
I am here because I need help

38:42.912 --> 38:46.489
learning how not
to be reckless.

38:47.551 --> 38:48.716
- Hey, Sid's here.

38:48.718 --> 38:51.143
- Jay, we are in the middle
of something.

38:51.163 --> 38:54.389
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
but she's in your office,
she needs to speak to you.

38:54.391 --> 38:57.208
She won't speak to me unless
you come down. I'm sorry.

39:01.064 --> 39:03.214
Sorry, Mike.
- Yeah.

39:07.846 --> 39:10.572
- Baby girl, what's up?
- I'm not going home.

39:10.590 --> 39:12.682
- Why?
- Or I'll just stay at Dad's,

39:12.759 --> 39:15.518
or I'll get a motel, or I'll
stay here, for all I care.

39:15.595 --> 39:17.854
- Hey, relax. Everything's fine,
just tell us what's going on,

39:17.931 --> 39:19.914
and we'll figure it out.
- He has a gun.

39:19.916 --> 39:21.749
- Who has a gun?
- He has a gun!

39:21.751 --> 39:25.695
And I'm not going home.
- You saw Keith with a gun?

39:25.772 --> 39:27.179
- Yes, I saw him steal it.

39:27.199 --> 39:29.591
So, as long as he has it,
I'm not going home.

39:29.609 --> 39:31.517
(vehicle approaching)

39:31.536 --> 39:32.535
- He's alive.

39:32.779 --> 39:34.612
- I'm afraid you'll have
to be more specific.

39:34.764 --> 39:36.539
- Isaiah Danzomo.

39:36.691 --> 39:40.768
The man who kidnapped me
in Lagos, demanded a ransom,

39:40.862 --> 39:43.287
which you refused to pay.

39:43.440 --> 39:46.866
You told me that he was killed
in a police raid.

39:46.885 --> 39:48.868
Why did you tell me
that he was dead?

39:48.887 --> 39:52.705
All these years,
why lie to your own daughter?

39:52.724 --> 39:55.374
- Because no good would come
from you knowing he's alive!

39:55.394 --> 40:00.146
Now, please, for both
of our sakes, drop it.

40:02.901 --> 40:06.294
(door opens and closes)

40:06.387 --> 40:07.362
- Keith?

40:10.242 --> 40:12.033
Baby!

40:14.804 --> 40:16.538
He's not upstairs.

40:28.652 --> 40:31.002
- Buddy, what are you
doing down here?

40:31.430 --> 40:33.004
- Um, nothing.

40:33.080 --> 40:35.247
- Why aren't you in your room?

40:35.267 --> 40:37.058
- What do you mean, nothing?

40:37.844 --> 40:39.436
- I like it here.

40:40.605 --> 40:42.272
It's familiar.

40:43.424 --> 40:45.625
- Sidney said you had a gun.

40:46.594 --> 40:50.596
- I did. Not that it's
any of her business.

40:50.674 --> 40:52.023
- Well, it's ours.

40:52.099 --> 40:54.025
You can't have a gun, Keith.

40:54.177 --> 40:56.527
You certainly can't steal one.

40:56.604 --> 40:59.013
- I didn't...
Is that what she said?

40:59.032 --> 41:01.124
I didn't steal a gun.

41:01.275 --> 41:04.002
I... I got it from Drew.

41:04.854 --> 41:06.963
He said I could borrow it.

41:08.800 --> 41:10.208
- It's a pellet gun.

41:11.361 --> 41:15.196
- Drew uses it to plink cans
in his backyard.

41:15.790 --> 41:17.548
I thought it looked real enough.

41:17.701 --> 41:19.550
- Real enough for what?

41:20.294 --> 41:22.720
- To scare off the person
that took me.

41:22.797 --> 41:24.355
- Oh, honey.

41:29.045 --> 41:31.988
Hey. We'll protect you.

41:32.139 --> 41:34.407
- Sidney thought I stole a gun?

41:35.977 --> 41:37.902
<i> She still doesn't believe me.</i>

41:37.979 --> 41:39.996
<i> (Nikki): She will.</i>

41:40.890 --> 41:43.374
<i> She just needs time. Hmm.</i>

41:45.895 --> 41:48.412
- Let's go upstairs,
you guys. Come on.

41:48.565 --> 41:50.155
Come on. Come on.

41:50.233 --> 41:53.968
- Uh, you go.
I'll come up later.

41:55.847 --> 41:58.014
- We can stay, if you like.

42:00.076 --> 42:03.394
- On your way up, would you
mind turning off the light?

42:05.357 --> 42:07.190
- Come on.

42:10.103 --> 42:12.654
(soft music)

42:18.778 --> 42:21.520
- Sid. I didn't know
you were here.

42:21.540 --> 42:24.707
- Sorry. I'm just waiting
for my mom.

42:25.285 --> 42:28.711
- No worries. He and I are happy
to have some company.

42:29.881 --> 42:31.256
- He?

42:32.551 --> 42:34.074
You know it's a boy?

42:34.794 --> 42:38.613
- I do. Uh... Between 10 and 14.

42:39.132 --> 42:41.465
I'm getting to know a lot
about him, actually.

42:42.043 --> 42:46.104
I don't know his name yet,
but I will.

42:47.214 --> 42:48.982
You should tell him yours.

42:58.151 --> 43:01.452
- Hey. I'm Sidney.

43:04.974 --> 43:06.749
It's nice to see you.

43:10.422 --> 43:12.046
Little bro.

43:14.759 --> 43:14.915
Subtitling: difuze
