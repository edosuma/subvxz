00:33.992 --> 00:37.662
Every study they've ever done
to determine who's smarter,

00:37.746 --> 00:42.375
men or women, every study comes back
and says women are smarter.

00:42.459 --> 00:44.210
-Every fucking one.

00:44.294 --> 00:46.588
Ladies, you shouldn't be applauding that.

00:47.839 --> 00:49.424
You know I'm an asshole.

00:49.966 --> 00:52.051
You know this isn't gonna end well.

00:55.013 --> 00:58.725
"Did he say I'm pretty? Oh, my God."

00:58.808 --> 01:00.602
Get out of the relationship.

01:05.565 --> 01:09.652
If every study says that you're smarter--
okay--

01:09.736 --> 01:12.989
the question you should be asking yourself
was, "If we're so goddamn smart,

01:13.073 --> 01:15.325
how are we in the situation we're in?"

01:19.662 --> 01:20.747
Well?

01:25.335 --> 01:28.671
You're in the situation you're in,
not because of guys like me.

01:28.755 --> 01:30.965
As much as you wanna blame me, you know?

01:31.466 --> 01:34.844
Ladies, you can't tell me you never
drove by a sports bar on a football Sunday

01:34.928 --> 01:36.805
and looked at the humanity in there.

01:37.305 --> 01:40.850
All those dumb guys with their
big beer bellies bumping chests.

01:40.934 --> 01:44.896
"Hey, he's on my fantasy team.
Up top, yeah.

01:44.979 --> 01:47.482
You wanna get
some more mozzarella sticks?"

01:49.651 --> 01:51.444
As a woman, with your bigger brain,

01:51.528 --> 01:54.072
you never looked in there
and thought to yourself,

01:54.155 --> 01:57.408
"I'm fucking losing to that?
I'm losing to that."

02:01.538 --> 02:06.751
My nephew is 25 years old,
and he is dating this architect.

02:06.835 --> 02:11.506
My goodness,
she-- she is so smart and interesting,

02:11.589 --> 02:14.384
successful and charismatic.

02:14.467 --> 02:17.887
And we all hope
that he marries her one day.

02:17.971 --> 02:20.390
But he calls me up earlier this week,
and he was like,

02:20.473 --> 02:24.269
"You know, Auntie Ali,
I think I'ma break up with her.

02:24.894 --> 02:27.105
Yeah, because she's a boss at work,

02:27.188 --> 02:32.068
and so she thinks it's okay
to come home and boss me around."

02:34.112 --> 02:36.364
I was like, "Oh.

02:38.324 --> 02:39.367
Well,

02:40.660 --> 02:43.580
that's shit's gonna happen to you
no matter what."

02:50.837 --> 02:54.674
Whether she a boss,
whether she employed or unemployed,

02:55.174 --> 03:00.179
once you get married and have kids,
your wife gonna boss you around.

03:00.889 --> 03:05.143
And you would know that
if you watched <i>House Hunters</i>.

03:09.314 --> 03:13.318
<i>House Hunters</i> is a show on HGTV

03:13.401 --> 03:18.990
where a couple pretends that
there's a decision to be made together.

03:24.120 --> 03:29.208
And they go on this fake-ass journey
looking at three different houses.

03:29.292 --> 03:32.211
And the audience is meant
to be left in suspense.

03:32.295 --> 03:35.798
"Oh, which house are they gonna choose?"

03:37.842 --> 03:42.513
It's whichever one Barbara wanted
in the first place, okay?

03:44.182 --> 03:48.228
And Barbara, who lives in Boise, Idaho,

03:48.311 --> 03:52.774
or wherever the fuck
these HGTV shows are filmed

03:52.857 --> 03:56.152
where houses cost $5,000 an acre…

04:01.324 --> 04:05.453
Barbara, she don't got money,
power or respect,

04:05.536 --> 04:07.705
but Barbara is a woman.

04:07.789 --> 04:11.751
And all women are very good at

04:11.834 --> 04:14.587
being extremely unpleasant…

04:17.340 --> 04:21.511
and holding your happiness
and self-esteem hostage

04:21.594 --> 04:24.681
until we get
what we fucking deserve, okay?

04:25.265 --> 04:27.392
-Yes.

04:28.810 --> 04:31.479
I'm at that age where I don't like
going to the doctor.

04:32.730 --> 04:35.984
'Cause a lot of doctors are my age.

04:39.070 --> 04:41.489
And they're Indian,
which means I might know them.

04:42.532 --> 04:45.118
So we're sitting there
in the waiting room at NYU, right?

04:45.201 --> 04:47.245
Door opens, nurse come out.

04:47.996 --> 04:51.040
She's like, "Dr. Gupta will see you now."

04:51.124 --> 04:52.458
I'm like, "Oh…

04:52.542 --> 04:55.378
…this better not be Arjun Gupta
from Sacramento."

04:56.212 --> 04:59.632
Then I hear a familiar voice.
He's like, "Hasan Minhaj?"

04:59.716 --> 05:02.802
I'm like, "This is Arjun Gupta
from Sacramento!"

05:02.885 --> 05:06.014
I know this kid. He's a fucking idiot.

05:07.640 --> 05:10.935
He failed out of the Caribbean med school.

05:11.019 --> 05:12.020
Twice!

05:12.103 --> 05:14.480
I go, "Arjun, how are you licensed?"

05:14.564 --> 05:16.107
He's like, "I don't know.

05:17.608 --> 05:20.361
That's why I'm a jizz doctor
with a basement office.

05:20.862 --> 05:22.697
Yo, drop your pants. How's auntie?"

05:22.780 --> 05:24.907
I'm like,
"Don't talk about my mom, Arjun."

05:25.491 --> 05:27.452
Beena, he's not even an MD!

05:28.369 --> 05:31.205
He's a goddamn DO!

05:33.499 --> 05:35.626
Oh, boo.

05:35.710 --> 05:39.088
Boo it up, DOs. In the back.

05:39.172 --> 05:42.508
Doctors of osteopathic medicine
hate that joke.

05:43.259 --> 05:47.096
So MDs and DOs,
they're basically the same.

05:47.180 --> 05:48.765
They're both good doctors.

05:49.557 --> 05:51.309
The only thing is

05:51.392 --> 05:54.729
a DO's sense of humor stops
at their MCAT score.

05:57.440 --> 05:59.192
You see those seats? Way back there?

05:59.275 --> 06:00.735
Those are the DO seats.

06:01.486 --> 06:04.363
These are the MD seats.
Do you know what the difference is?

06:05.031 --> 06:07.867
It's five points on your MCAT, okay?

06:09.577 --> 06:13.164
So this dude is all up in my merchandise.
He's like, "Bro, I know what's wrong."

06:13.247 --> 06:14.665
I'm like, "Stop saying 'bro.'"

06:14.749 --> 06:17.251
He's like, "Son, oh…

06:19.587 --> 06:22.090
you got too much blood down there.
It's lowering your sperm count.

06:22.173 --> 06:25.593
So we're gonna do a dangerous surgery
called varicocele repair.

06:25.676 --> 06:28.554
But don't worry.
I'll be doing the surgery."

06:29.931 --> 06:32.308
I go, "Arjun, I'm very worried."

06:32.391 --> 06:34.352
You're in a lab coat and Jordans.

06:36.604 --> 06:39.482
Still pulls out a trimmer. He goes,
"Let me shave you right now."

06:40.441 --> 06:45.029
"Let's do this right here, right now."
I go, "Arjun, back up. I'm not ready."

06:46.447 --> 06:47.782
He goes, "Listen, man.

06:48.699 --> 06:50.493
If you don't get this surgery,

06:52.161 --> 06:53.538
you can't have kids.

06:54.872 --> 06:55.998
Ever."

06:57.917 --> 06:59.460
I go, "Are you serious?

07:00.753 --> 07:02.713
Me and Beena, we can't have kids?

07:04.006 --> 07:06.509
Like, you're telling me
we can't start a family?"

07:08.845 --> 07:11.973
See, that's the crazy thing
they never tell you about adulthood.

07:13.307 --> 07:18.271
Life gets very real
when "don't want" becomes "can't have."

07:20.273 --> 07:21.774
Isn't that right, DOs?

07:27.488 --> 07:30.992
I don't think anybody should feel bad if
they get diagnosed with a mental illness.

07:31.075 --> 07:33.035
'Cause it's just information about you

07:33.119 --> 07:35.538
that helps you know
how to take better care of yourself.

07:35.621 --> 07:37.457
-Yeah.

07:38.499 --> 07:40.126
Being bipolar--
There's nothing wrong with it.

07:40.209 --> 07:42.211
Being bipolar is like
not knowing how to swim.

07:42.295 --> 07:43.838
It might be embarrassing to tell people,

07:43.921 --> 07:46.549
and it might be hard
to take you certain places.

07:53.014 --> 07:55.183
But they have arm floaties.

07:56.809 --> 07:59.479
And if you just take your arm floaties…

08:01.147 --> 08:03.274
you can go wherever the hell you want.

08:04.609 --> 08:06.903
And I know some of you are like,

08:06.986 --> 08:09.405
"But, Taylor, what if people judge me
for taking arm floaties?"

08:09.489 --> 08:11.616
Well, those people don't care
if you live or die,

08:11.699 --> 08:13.201
so maybe who cares?

08:13.784 --> 08:16.162
Maybe fuck those people a little.

08:16.245 --> 08:18.498
-I don't know.

08:24.670 --> 08:27.715
That being said,
you have to take your arm floaties.

08:28.508 --> 08:30.676
Because it's not cool
to know you can't swim,

08:30.760 --> 08:32.887
go to the public pool anyway
and jump into the deep end,

08:32.970 --> 08:34.972
making it everyone else's problem.

08:36.224 --> 08:39.894
You're thrashing around going, "I'm good."
They're like, "You literally drowning."

08:39.977 --> 08:42.480
And then someone nice
and handsome jumps in to help you,

08:42.563 --> 08:44.607
and you're like,
"See, I'm fine. I can totally swim."

08:44.690 --> 08:47.985
And they're like,
"No, you're holding him underwater.

08:49.111 --> 08:51.906
You turned Kevin into an arm floaty,

08:52.698 --> 08:56.118
and that's not a fair relationship
for Kevin."

08:58.037 --> 09:01.290
Then someone floats by you on their back
and you're like, "What was that?"

09:01.374 --> 09:05.127
And they're like, "Oh, that's someone
whose parents supported them in the pool…

09:08.923 --> 09:11.384
until they could be trusted not to die.

09:12.468 --> 09:14.887
Here are your arm floaties."

09:17.515 --> 09:21.018
After leaving a, uh--
a taco stand one night,

09:21.519 --> 09:25.773
I, uh-- I realized that a lot of people
needed to step out of their comfort zones

09:25.856 --> 09:29.151
in order to find alternative ways
of making ends meet.

09:29.235 --> 09:33.864
I made the mistake one night of assuming
the guy working the stand was Mexican.

09:35.241 --> 09:36.325
He wasn't.

09:37.868 --> 09:40.955
I even spoke Spanish
to him, which is a no-no.

09:41.038 --> 09:45.626
The rule is, when engaging a brown person,
you must speak English to them first,

09:45.710 --> 09:48.421
and then if there's a language barrier,
then you go to plan B,

09:48.504 --> 09:49.714
high school Spanish.

09:50.506 --> 09:52.216
You start off in English.
"Hello, sir, may I--"

09:53.467 --> 09:55.469
Oh, hold on. I got this. I got this.

09:55.553 --> 09:56.846
<i>Hola.</i>

10:01.684 --> 10:04.145
So I walked up to this guy at the stand,
and I was like--

10:04.228 --> 10:05.896
You know, he reminded me of a <i>tío</i>.

10:05.980 --> 10:08.316
So I was like, you know…

10:08.399 --> 10:10.192
Which is like,
"Hello, friend. How are you?"

10:10.276 --> 10:11.277
And he responded…

10:11.360 --> 10:13.696
…"What are you saying to me?"

10:16.616 --> 10:19.118
"I'm sorry, sir.
I thought you were Mexican."

10:19.201 --> 10:22.246
"No, no. I am not Mexican.
I am not Mexican.

10:22.330 --> 10:23.539
I am Greek."

10:24.373 --> 10:25.625
Greek?

10:26.542 --> 10:28.044
Shit, I was way off.

10:30.296 --> 10:33.674
"I'm sorry, bro. It's late, I'm tired.
Can I have two tacos?"

10:33.758 --> 10:36.469
"What you mean, 'Can I have two tacos?'

10:36.552 --> 10:39.680
I just finished tell you I am not Mexican.
I am Greek.

10:39.764 --> 10:41.766
I do not sell taco.

10:43.100 --> 10:44.644
I sell gyro."

10:45.728 --> 10:46.937
Gyro?

10:47.521 --> 10:49.649
Then I remembered seeing writing
on the front of the cart,

10:49.732 --> 10:52.568
and I just thought it was
the guy's name or something, right?

10:53.319 --> 10:57.114
I was like, "It spells it out. G-Y-R-O.

10:57.698 --> 10:59.075
It's a gyro."

11:00.326 --> 11:03.496
He got all pissy.
"It is not a gyro. It is gyro."

11:04.538 --> 11:05.873
"That shit says 'gyro.'"

11:06.916 --> 11:08.167
"It is gyro!"

11:08.250 --> 11:11.253
"Bro, I'm tired. It's late.
What is a gyro?"

11:16.133 --> 11:17.343
"It's like a taco."

11:22.515 --> 11:25.601
I found out, y'all. I'm not butch.

11:27.103 --> 11:28.104
Yeah.

11:31.524 --> 11:34.902
I am not butch, which is shocking, I know,

11:34.985 --> 11:38.906
'cause I have these broad shoulders
and my favorite color is plaid.

11:40.783 --> 11:43.035
But this is a preview
to a whole different movie

11:43.119 --> 11:45.663
than what you think you're about to watch.

11:46.163 --> 11:49.875
As they say,
the carpet does not match the drapes.

11:50.793 --> 11:53.712
Two things that I do not know
how to install.

12:04.223 --> 12:07.601
I look very handy, though.
I do. I look handy.

12:08.227 --> 12:10.813
If you saw me
and your car was broken down,

12:10.896 --> 12:13.482
you might assume I could fix your car.

12:14.150 --> 12:15.651
I got that look about me.

12:15.734 --> 12:18.154
'Cause that is what a butch lady can do.

12:18.237 --> 12:21.657
She can literally put your car
on her back…

12:23.534 --> 12:25.911
…and walk it to a service station.

12:28.247 --> 12:31.208
She can actually just spit
in your gas tank…

12:33.127 --> 12:35.171
…and your car will start.

12:36.005 --> 12:40.176
Oh, magical, but that is not me.

12:40.885 --> 12:44.472
And men are the most mystified
by this information.

12:44.555 --> 12:47.725
They come up to me constantly
at, like, a Home Depot

12:47.808 --> 12:49.768
because they assume I work there.

12:51.479 --> 12:54.273
They're like, "Uh, what's up, dude? Um…

12:55.274 --> 12:56.275
Where are the nails?"

12:56.358 --> 12:59.320
I'm like, "Ooh, I'm here
for a potted plant."

13:02.281 --> 13:06.035
"I do know they sell M&M's
at the checkout."

13:10.789 --> 13:13.209
Ain't nobody got no COVID
in here, do they? Shit.

13:13.292 --> 13:16.045
-No.
-Uh-uh, my ass.

13:17.922 --> 13:20.174
Little fake COVID card motherfuckers.

13:21.800 --> 13:24.845
Yeah, COVID is some bullshit, man,
you know.

13:24.929 --> 13:26.680
Fuckers talking about, "Take the shot."

13:26.764 --> 13:29.225
I'm-- You know--
I don't know what the fuck to do.

13:29.308 --> 13:31.852
That shit is--
They're trying to scare you with the shit.

13:31.936 --> 13:34.688
"Go ahead and take it. We got a pill now."

13:37.733 --> 13:41.362
I went on and got it. I said, "Fuck it."
I went on and got the motherfucking shit.

13:43.155 --> 13:44.990
Yeah, I went on and got it.

13:46.158 --> 13:48.744
When they started talking about
cutting my shit off Netflix,

13:48.827 --> 13:51.163
I said, "Here, where you wanna hit it at?
Put it--"

13:53.332 --> 13:55.459
I said, "Hit me in the ass with it.
Hit me."

14:06.095 --> 14:08.722
I thought I had it. I did.
I thought I had it.

14:08.806 --> 14:11.308
I went to the doctor.
He said, "That ain't what I said."

14:11.392 --> 14:12.643
I said, "What did you say?"

14:12.726 --> 14:16.522
He said, "I told you you tested positive
for cocaine on the 19th."

14:18.232 --> 14:21.986
I said, "I didn't hear you. I didn't know
what you said. All I heard was 19."

14:28.534 --> 14:30.202
See, niggas don't wanna take the shot.

14:30.286 --> 14:34.123
The best way to get niggas
to take that shot is put it in flavors.

14:35.499 --> 14:39.211
That motherfucker poppin'.
That pineapple Moderna, nigga?

14:40.004 --> 14:41.547
Shit.

14:42.423 --> 14:44.300
That watermelon Pfizer?

14:45.718 --> 14:48.429
"Look it here, man.
I'm on my ninth shot, man.

14:48.512 --> 14:51.807
You know they got the mango
coming out next month, man."

14:57.438 --> 14:58.898
My problem with guns is

14:58.981 --> 15:01.775
I don't buy either side's arguments
completely, right?

15:01.859 --> 15:04.945
So, the conservative argument is
that guns were written in the constitution

15:05.029 --> 15:07.781
because the founding fathers thought
if all the citizens have guns,

15:07.865 --> 15:10.910
the government will have to do what
they say or else the people will rise up

15:10.993 --> 15:12.494
and fight the government, right?

15:12.578 --> 15:16.832
Which is a legitimately great idea
in the 1700s,

15:17.833 --> 15:20.878
but the problem is
there's still people now hoarding weapons

15:20.961 --> 15:24.757
thinking that at some point they may need
to take on the American military,

15:24.840 --> 15:27.092
and they think they have a shot, right?

15:28.302 --> 15:30.012
And look, maybe they're right,

15:30.095 --> 15:33.057
which is why I'm proposing
we test their theory

15:33.140 --> 15:36.018
and once a year have
a head-to-head shoot-up.

15:40.689 --> 15:42.858
Say, a-- a hundred members of the NRA

15:42.942 --> 15:45.402
versus, I don't know,
two members of the military.

15:46.737 --> 15:49.156
Broadcast it on Fox, Christmas Day.

15:50.449 --> 15:54.995
Like, "Merry Christmas, and welcome
to the 2022 NRA-military showdown.

15:55.663 --> 15:58.582
Let's go down to the field of battle
and meet one of our NRA combatants.

15:58.666 --> 16:00.960
Sir, what's your name?
What kind of weapon you working with?"

16:01.043 --> 16:02.378
He's like, "My name's Andy Baker,

16:02.461 --> 16:05.297
and I got a AR15,
wearing Kevlar head to toe."

16:05.381 --> 16:07.466
"Andy, how confident are you,
scale of one to ten?"

16:07.549 --> 16:09.176
"Fucking a million."

16:14.807 --> 16:16.934
"We're gonna check in
with the military real quick."

16:17.017 --> 16:19.520
They cut to one guy by himself
in a bunker, and he's like,

16:19.603 --> 16:21.855
"My name's
Staff Sergeant Jeremiah Walker."

16:21.939 --> 16:23.857
"Jeremiah, what kind of weapon
are you working with?"

16:23.941 --> 16:27.820
He's like, "I don't know if this is fair,
but I'm working with a drone.

16:34.827 --> 16:39.081
Yeah, it's equipped with eight Hellfire
missiles and a high-powered camera.

16:39.164 --> 16:40.749
As you can see on this monitor here,

16:40.833 --> 16:43.627
the NRA fellows are actually
in just one big cluster.

16:46.714 --> 16:50.175
So, uh-- I'm gonna--
Have we started? All right.

16:52.761 --> 16:56.015
All right, yeah, so I'm gonna hit
this button right here.

16:58.726 --> 17:00.185
Yeah, now they're all dead."

17:01.186 --> 17:04.940
"That'll do it
for this year's NRA-military showdown…

17:07.484 --> 17:12.114
…brought to you by Whole Foods."

17:15.826 --> 17:18.120
The bigger your boobs are,
the uglier that bra is.

17:18.203 --> 17:20.414
-There's some truth for you. Yeah.

17:20.497 --> 17:23.250
If you're working with
anything over a C cup, I got you.

17:23.333 --> 17:27.171
I know that pain.
I know how hideous our bras are, okay?

17:27.254 --> 17:29.882
So you are my people. Anything--

17:29.965 --> 17:33.177
And I know, people are like,
"You've got big boobs. Is that hard?"

17:33.260 --> 17:35.054
It fucking is. Okay?

17:35.679 --> 17:37.723
-They gaslight you. That's right.

17:37.806 --> 17:40.059
There's where all the big tits are. Yeah.

17:40.142 --> 17:42.269
The world wants you
to have giant knockers,

17:42.352 --> 17:45.856
and then when you do, they give you
no infrastructure to support them.

17:45.939 --> 17:47.357
All we want are cute bras.

17:47.441 --> 17:50.444
Instead, they're like,
"Here's a Soviet-era wind sock.

17:50.527 --> 17:55.074
Just-Just strap it on and help plow.
Just do it."

17:56.992 --> 17:58.619
You never got to wear the cute bras.

17:58.702 --> 18:00.662
Remember when you were a teenager
and your girlfriends--

18:00.746 --> 18:03.874
By the way, if you have smaller breasts,
if you got an A cup or a B cup,

18:03.957 --> 18:06.126
like, this is size-inclusive,
but you don't know.

18:06.919 --> 18:08.879
You don't know what it was like
being friends with you

18:08.962 --> 18:11.590
and all your girlfriends are like,
"Let's go to the mall." Remember malls?

18:11.673 --> 18:14.843
And you'd go, and they--
"Let's go get cute bras at Abercrombie."

18:14.927 --> 18:15.928
Remember Abercrombie?

18:16.011 --> 18:17.012
And you'd go with them.

18:17.096 --> 18:18.180
They're running forward,

18:18.263 --> 18:21.058
and you're carrying around
your grown-woman divorcée chest

18:21.141 --> 18:22.267
like, "Wait for me.

18:23.977 --> 18:26.730
I can't run. I'm not wearing
two sports bras. I'm coming."

18:27.231 --> 18:29.650
They're all trying on cute bras,
playing slap tickle.

18:29.733 --> 18:33.362
You're just sitting there eating a slice
from Sbarro, like, "I'll be here.

18:36.240 --> 18:38.700
My mom's getting me at two.
I'll just be here."

18:39.326 --> 18:40.577
They'd have the cutest bras.

18:40.661 --> 18:42.913
I always wanted the cute bras.
None for you.

18:42.996 --> 18:46.250
They'd come out cute. "Look at this one.
It's made of moose felt.

18:48.418 --> 18:50.963
So bucolic.
Look at this one, it's got hearts on it.

18:51.046 --> 18:52.631
This one's got little kisses on it.

18:52.714 --> 18:54.716
I'm a child. Isn't this so cute?

18:55.968 --> 18:57.219
This one's got feathers.

18:57.302 --> 18:59.972
This one's just two contact lenses
and dental floss.

19:01.181 --> 19:02.182
Bouncy."

19:02.724 --> 19:05.477
Not me!
Not me and every other big-breasted girl.

19:05.561 --> 19:08.772
We were getting hauled
to some back-alley discount van

19:09.982 --> 19:14.862
where some Eastern European woman
named Loretta is gonna hand-fit you,

19:14.945 --> 19:18.824
scoop each breast
into its own personal hurt locker

19:18.907 --> 19:22.244
and jiggle your tits around
in front of your mother!

19:26.790 --> 19:29.626
You're just sitting there.
You've never even made out with a boy.

19:29.710 --> 19:32.045
She's just grabbing at you like,
"How does this feel?"

19:32.129 --> 19:34.673
You're like,
"I'm kinda turned on. I don't know."

19:38.177 --> 19:40.637
I'm a little bit late
to the self-care game.

19:41.138 --> 19:45.976
I-- I just started using
enough body lotion.

19:46.935 --> 19:50.314
You know what I mean?
To really moisturize the whole body.

19:51.023 --> 19:52.774
It's a lot of lotion.

19:53.692 --> 19:57.237
I always cheated myself.
I didn't think I deserved that much.

19:58.071 --> 19:59.781
I always gave myself a modest amount,

19:59.865 --> 20:03.243
started lotioning from the top down,
so my legs paid the price.

20:05.204 --> 20:06.705
Then I joined Costco.

20:08.832 --> 20:11.126
Changed my life.
Costco lotion is a great value.

20:11.210 --> 20:13.212
Comes in a big old container.

20:13.295 --> 20:15.923
Usually has a convenient pump
on top, right?

20:16.006 --> 20:18.508
The only issue is,
about two-thirds into the bottle,

20:18.592 --> 20:20.844
the technology collapses.

20:22.054 --> 20:23.513
Oh, no.

20:23.597 --> 20:26.141
A lot of lotion left,
but you can't access it via the pump.

20:26.225 --> 20:27.476
The pump is dead.

20:28.393 --> 20:32.648
At that point you gotta unscrew the top
and use the pump like a dipstick.

20:35.984 --> 20:37.152
I don't like that.

20:39.029 --> 20:42.115
Going from pumping to dipping,
that's a humbling transition.

20:43.659 --> 20:46.536
You know? 'Cause when I'm pumping,
I feel carefree. I feel rich. I'm like…

20:47.204 --> 20:49.665
"Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

20:50.666 --> 20:52.251
Keep the change."

20:55.671 --> 20:57.631
When I'm dipping, it's like, "Oh…

21:02.386 --> 21:04.346
I'm an intelligent animal.

21:08.600 --> 21:09.810
I can use tool."

21:15.691 --> 21:18.026
You know, you gotta twist and pull
at the same time.

21:18.110 --> 21:20.487
It's like buttering toast
with a chopstick.

21:27.661 --> 21:30.831
I got body lotion. I got face lotion.

21:30.914 --> 21:33.583
I stepped up my game. I got eye cream.

21:34.876 --> 21:37.087
That's next-level, you know?

21:37.170 --> 21:41.341
Eye cream is serious
'cause eye cream costs more.

21:42.759 --> 21:46.096
More than any other lotion you ever bought
in your whole life.

21:46.179 --> 21:48.348
But it comes in the tiniest container.

21:48.849 --> 21:50.934
You have to justify
this precious purchase.

21:51.018 --> 21:53.687
You only apply the eye cream
with your ring finger.

21:54.855 --> 21:56.857
The softest finger, right?

21:56.940 --> 21:58.859
'Cause it's the laziest finger.

21:59.484 --> 22:03.155
Your ring finger, it don't pick,
it don't point, it don't cuss.

22:04.906 --> 22:07.451
It's-- It's only--

22:09.619 --> 22:12.039
Your ring finger is only good
for making one promise

22:12.122 --> 22:13.123
and eye cream.

22:14.666 --> 22:17.711
Which you apply
in a gentle, dabbing motion

22:17.794 --> 22:19.671
with your mouth slightly open like…

22:26.470 --> 22:27.971
"This better work.

22:29.681 --> 22:31.266
So expensive."

22:35.270 --> 22:37.606
Now as an adult, though,
I speak three languages.

22:37.689 --> 22:41.568
I speak Spanish, English and Caucasian.

22:43.028 --> 22:44.863
Now, Caucasian is like English,

22:44.946 --> 22:47.407
but I have to use fancy words
I don't normally use,

22:47.491 --> 22:49.618
like "organic" and "deductible."

22:52.079 --> 22:53.121
Let me give you an example.

22:53.205 --> 22:55.415
Like, in my everyday life,
when my friends mess up,

22:55.499 --> 22:57.584
I'm like, "Bitch, you fucked up."

22:59.377 --> 23:03.632
But in Caucasian, I'm like,
"Ma'am, that is unacceptable."

23:03.715 --> 23:06.510
See? A little right there? A little--

23:10.430 --> 23:12.015
"I will fuck you up."

23:13.058 --> 23:14.976
"Let me speak to the manager."

23:15.060 --> 23:16.061
See?

23:19.481 --> 23:23.193
When my mom pees, she doesn't wipe.

23:24.319 --> 23:26.321
Ooh, I heard a woman right there go, "Ew."

23:26.404 --> 23:28.365
Look, she's covering her mouth,
and she waved.

23:28.448 --> 23:30.033
Look, right there in the jeans.

23:30.534 --> 23:34.329
Jean jacket, she went, "Ugh!"
Like it was a-- Like, "Oh, my God."

23:34.412 --> 23:37.624
And then she went like this,
"That was me. That's-- Ew."

23:37.707 --> 23:38.708
Look at her.

23:40.252 --> 23:42.379
I'm gonna tell you why. What's your name?

23:42.462 --> 23:43.839
-Eileen.
-Eileen.

23:43.922 --> 23:47.592
Let me tell you why she doesn't use paper.
All right, Eileen?

23:47.676 --> 23:50.178
Because she washes it with water.
So ew you, bitch.

23:50.262 --> 23:55.308
Don't you ever disrespect my mom's pussy.

23:55.392 --> 24:00.230
It's the cleanest pussy in Los Ang--

24:01.982 --> 24:03.233
She calls it a tabò.

24:07.737 --> 24:08.864
It's a cup.

24:10.699 --> 24:13.577
There's a lot of people in here going,
"What's a tabò?"

24:13.660 --> 24:15.245
Especially the ones that aren't Filipino.

24:15.328 --> 24:17.080
I'ma tell you what a tabò is.

24:17.581 --> 24:18.999
A tabò can be anything.

24:20.834 --> 24:22.878
A coffee mug with a broken handle.

24:25.130 --> 24:28.550
An empty I Can't Believe It's Not Butter!
container.

24:30.760 --> 24:33.805
Or my mom's favorite,
a Super Big Gulp cup.

24:35.098 --> 24:38.101
"Because it holds
44 ounces of water, Joseph.

24:38.852 --> 24:40.729
I can really clean it, huh?"

24:42.522 --> 24:45.817
And my mom's tabò sits
in the same spot it always sat in

24:45.901 --> 24:48.236
since the day she moved to this country.

24:48.320 --> 24:52.407
Between the--
Between the shower and the toilet.

24:53.450 --> 24:57.412
That little area right there
is called tabò lane.

24:59.331 --> 25:01.833
And that's
where my mom's special cup sits.

25:02.751 --> 25:05.337
And I know there's a lot of guys in here
that aren't Filipino going,

25:05.420 --> 25:07.339
"Why are you telling us this, Jo Koy?"

25:07.422 --> 25:08.965
Well, I'll tell you why.

25:09.049 --> 25:12.385
Say you start dating a Filipino chick
and things go well.

25:12.886 --> 25:15.639
You hook up one night,
and you stay the night at her house.

25:15.722 --> 25:18.475
You wake up, brush your teeth,
and you're like, "I need a cup."

25:18.558 --> 25:21.394
-Don't use that fucking cup.

25:24.689 --> 25:26.524
That cup is not for your mouth.

25:29.903 --> 25:32.614
Anytime my wife and I go out,
when we go back to the house,

25:32.697 --> 25:36.743
she's always shocked
how fast I get into bed, all right?

25:38.119 --> 25:41.581
I don't know what you people do
after a night out,

25:41.665 --> 25:45.877
but I go home, I brush my teeth,
take my clothes-- And boom.

25:45.961 --> 25:47.128
Right in bed.

25:48.255 --> 25:49.756
There's no washing the face.

25:49.839 --> 25:51.967
I just washed it two hours ago.

25:52.050 --> 25:57.806
What? I'm gonna take a-- a sink bath
after going out for an hour and a half?

26:01.226 --> 26:05.355
My wife always walks in the bedroom,
"Oh, my God. You're in bed already?"

26:05.438 --> 26:08.108
"Yeah. It's nighttime.

26:08.191 --> 26:11.361
What did you think I was gonna do?
Cut the lawn?

26:11.444 --> 26:13.738
Get in. Get in."

26:21.454 --> 26:23.999
I don't know what she does
in that bathroom.

26:25.792 --> 26:28.169
The noises that are coming out of there.

26:28.920 --> 26:32.007
The water--

26:34.342 --> 26:37.387
She comes out rolling her face
with some spiked roller.

26:37.470 --> 26:41.391
I go, "Is that-- You're bleeding.
Is that helping you?

26:42.642 --> 26:45.395
My mother uses that to make pasta.

26:45.478 --> 26:49.357
Why are you using that on your forehead?"

26:53.862 --> 26:56.865
Then she puts some Korean mask on.
You ever see the m--

26:56.948 --> 27:00.994
As soon as you see the mask, you're like,
"No sex tonight. There goes that."

27:01.828 --> 27:04.497
I'm gonna make love to a hockey goalie?

27:06.458 --> 27:09.586
"Just blink, babe,
so I know you're enjoying this.

27:11.004 --> 27:12.505
You under that thing?"

27:16.134 --> 27:20.722
White schools do not celebrate
Black History Month

27:20.805 --> 27:23.475
the same way Black schools do.

27:23.558 --> 27:24.559
Mm-mmm.

27:24.642 --> 27:26.770
White schools celebrate
Black History Month

27:26.853 --> 27:29.773
according to how many Black kids
is at the school.

27:30.940 --> 27:33.443
So if it's four niggas, it's four days.

27:36.279 --> 27:38.156
Let's just say,
at my kids' fucking school,

27:38.239 --> 27:40.909
Spirit Week lasts longer
than Black History Month.

27:41.743 --> 27:43.244
And the few white people I see here,

27:43.328 --> 27:46.164
I don't know if you know how important
Black History Month is to us,

27:46.247 --> 27:49.417
but we used to go all-out for that shit,
didn't we, Black people?

27:49.501 --> 27:51.503
You had to dress up as a Black hero

27:51.586 --> 27:54.881
and be that fucking Black hero
for 30 fucking days.

27:56.633 --> 27:59.469
Now I know what you're thinking.
"Ms. Pat, it's only 28 days."

27:59.552 --> 28:01.346
Fuck you, we took them two days back.

28:04.182 --> 28:05.975
So let me give you an example.

28:06.059 --> 28:08.520
If your child chose to be Harriet Tubman,

28:08.603 --> 28:11.564
your child had to be
Harriet fucking Tubman.

28:11.648 --> 28:17.320
Your child had to be smart,
be able to lead, be good at hide-and-seek…

28:19.572 --> 28:21.658
and be able to pistol-whip a nigga.

28:22.742 --> 28:24.702
And have a strong-ass face.

28:29.457 --> 28:31.084
Niggas, don't play with me.

28:32.335 --> 28:34.546
You know Harriet wasn't fucking cute.

28:36.214 --> 28:39.175
You know good and damn well
Harriet looked like her uncle.

28:43.012 --> 28:46.516
Now don't get me wrong. I'm not saying
I don't appreciate Harriet, 'cause I do.

28:46.599 --> 28:50.395
'Cause without Harriet, I'd be sucking
some white dude dick against my will.

28:55.191 --> 28:58.111
Y'all act like y'all would fuck Harriet.
Ain't a nigga here that'd fuck Harriet.

28:58.194 --> 29:00.613
Would you fuck Harriet?
You a girl. I'm sorry.

29:05.994 --> 29:08.329
You probably would fuck Harriet, but--

29:12.000 --> 29:14.544
I'm sorry, I didn't see you.
My glasses ain't on.

29:15.128 --> 29:18.131
You probably would
eat the shit out of her, but I'm sorry.

29:21.926 --> 29:24.804
Ah, anything to be free,
ain't that right, bitch?

29:27.640 --> 29:30.101
Eat your way straight out of master house.

29:33.104 --> 29:35.190
Someone tried to hug me today.

29:35.273 --> 29:37.400
I mean, I sound like a dick,

29:38.234 --> 29:41.571
but this older woman was very sweet,
and she saw me, and we both froze,

29:41.654 --> 29:44.866
and she goes, "Oh, no. Wait a second.

29:45.533 --> 29:48.828
No. Are you someone?"

29:50.079 --> 29:52.040
And I go, "Yes, I am."

29:53.124 --> 29:55.376
And she goes, "Give me a hug."

29:55.460 --> 29:56.878
I go, "Oh, no."

29:56.961 --> 30:00.215
Not because I don't like it.
It's just I'm terrified.

30:00.298 --> 30:01.299
You know what I mean?

30:01.883 --> 30:02.884
Who's hugging still?

30:02.967 --> 30:05.345
I go, "Maybe I could just
get away with a fist bump."

30:05.428 --> 30:08.348
She goes, "Nope. Come here. I'm a hugger."

30:10.350 --> 30:14.813
She did this eight-foot wingspan,
and she came in for the kill.

30:14.896 --> 30:18.441
And I gave up. I said, "All right,
bring it in. Let's both die. Come on."

30:19.067 --> 30:21.736
Because I don't know what's going on.
Is she sick? I don't--

30:22.362 --> 30:24.072
But that's how paranoid I am.

30:24.155 --> 30:26.991
And by the way, the old "I'm a hugger,"
can we get rid of that?

30:27.075 --> 30:28.535
I mean, it's not working anymore.

30:28.618 --> 30:31.412
"I'm a hugger" and that's it?
No questions asked?

30:33.081 --> 30:35.708
That shouldn't work anymore
for obvious reasons,

30:35.792 --> 30:39.045
and it definitely doesn't work with guys
for probably a hundred reasons.

30:39.128 --> 30:41.673
I mean, my uncle was like that.

30:41.756 --> 30:43.925
"Come on. Come here. I'm an ass-grabber.

30:44.008 --> 30:46.511
Get in here. Give me that juicy ass.

30:46.594 --> 30:49.722
No, it's okay. I'm just an ass-grabber.

30:50.515 --> 30:54.269
Don't be weird about it.
No, I grab asses, and I like it."

30:55.061 --> 30:56.229
"No, we understand that part."

30:56.312 --> 31:00.024
"I'm an old-school guy.
It's part of my charm.

31:00.108 --> 31:02.986
I'm a camel toe grazer,
and that's what I do.

31:03.069 --> 31:04.946
Just a little bit on the knuckles.

31:05.029 --> 31:07.198
I don't even feel it.
I have no nerve endings.

31:07.699 --> 31:08.825
You can't get mad.

31:10.410 --> 31:12.370
Ask my family. I've been doing it forever.

31:13.621 --> 31:17.834
I like to bump a biscuit now and then,
and everyone's been cool with it.

31:19.252 --> 31:22.922
I don't wanna change.
Don't be so woke. Come on."

31:25.174 --> 31:27.510
I went to England,
and I went to a dog show.

31:27.594 --> 31:29.304
We were filming something, obviously,

31:29.387 --> 31:32.265
'cause I would never seriously
go to a dog show.

31:34.017 --> 31:38.646
And I saw a Bernese Mountain Dog.
I had never seen this type of dog before.

31:38.730 --> 31:39.856
I was like, "Oh, my God.

31:39.939 --> 31:43.401
This is like something
I'd conjure up in my best dream."

31:44.027 --> 31:46.571
They're perfect.
They're black and brown and white.

31:46.654 --> 31:50.199
And they're lazy, you know?
They don't wanna do anything. I was like--

31:50.283 --> 31:53.202
You can tell in their eyes
that they just have no gumption.

31:53.286 --> 31:54.746
You're like…

31:54.829 --> 31:56.331
I was like, I want that dog.

31:56.414 --> 31:58.499
I came home. I told my assistant, Tanner.

31:58.583 --> 32:01.711
I said, "You need to get me
a Bernese Mountain Dog."

32:04.213 --> 32:07.216
But when you're a celebrity,
you cannot buy a dog.

32:07.300 --> 32:09.719
You have to rescue all of your animals.

32:11.346 --> 32:14.557
Otherwise, PETA will burn your house down.

32:19.395 --> 32:21.189
So I told my assistant, Tanner,

32:21.272 --> 32:25.818
"You need to find me
a used Bernese Mountain Dog."

32:34.077 --> 32:39.415
And two weeks later, this seven-pound,
two-week-old Bernese Mountain Dog

32:39.499 --> 32:41.417
traipsed into my life,
and I couldn't believe it.

32:41.501 --> 32:43.086
I named him Gary right away.

32:45.672 --> 32:48.591
But I hadn't thought it through
because puppies are energetic.

32:48.675 --> 32:50.343
They wanna play. That's all they wanna do.

32:50.426 --> 32:53.680
And their teeth are sharp,
and they jump on everything,

32:53.763 --> 32:55.056
and they're annoying.

32:57.016 --> 32:58.810
And my two other dogs met Gary.

32:58.893 --> 33:02.230
Within two hours, they went upstairs
to the second floor

33:02.313 --> 33:04.399
and didn't come down for two weeks.

33:05.566 --> 33:09.028
One of them texted me and said,
"Let us know when Gary's gone."

33:16.285 --> 33:19.747
Within 48 hours,
Gary had eaten two of my sofas.

33:19.831 --> 33:22.625
Not even my cushions. The entire sofa.

33:23.626 --> 33:25.253
I was like, "Oh, my God, what is"--

33:25.336 --> 33:27.755
We had to remove
all of the downstairs furniture.

33:27.839 --> 33:29.799
I was basically living
in an empty warehouse,

33:29.882 --> 33:34.178
wearing a miner's lamp and kneepads,
waiting for the next altercation.

33:35.930 --> 33:42.353
On day four,
I found a dead owl in my backyard.

33:43.312 --> 33:45.398
I didn't even know owls were real.

33:54.532 --> 33:56.951
I thought they were from <i>Game of Thrones</i>.

33:59.662 --> 34:02.874
One of my dreams came true. I got to go
to Switzerland for the first time.

34:02.957 --> 34:04.083
One of my dreams.

34:04.167 --> 34:07.336
If you don't know, I'll tell you
why it was such a big dream of mine.

34:07.420 --> 34:10.381
My mother is a Black woman, Xhosa woman,
from South Africa.

34:10.465 --> 34:12.300
I grew up in South Africa, right?

34:14.135 --> 34:17.889
My dad is a Swiss man from Switzerland.
White man, right?

34:17.972 --> 34:20.016
And so, I never got to go to Switzerland.

34:20.099 --> 34:22.935
When I got the chance, I never really
made the time, then I couldn't go.

34:23.019 --> 34:26.022
And then finally, now,
we went to Switzerland for the first time.

34:26.105 --> 34:29.734
And it was liberating, you know?
'Cause here's the thing.

34:29.817 --> 34:32.028
My whole life, my whole life,

34:32.111 --> 34:38.284
I have always felt like
my dad didn't really love me, okay?

34:38.367 --> 34:42.497
And then now,
when I went and met him in Switzerland,

34:42.580 --> 34:43.581
I was like, "No.

34:44.207 --> 34:45.708
He's just Swiss."

34:47.877 --> 34:49.295
They're all like that!

34:52.590 --> 34:53.966
It was a bit weird though.

34:54.050 --> 34:55.802
I tried to surprise him, though.

34:55.885 --> 34:58.721
I tried to surprise him
by learning German.

34:58.805 --> 35:01.432
We hadn't seen each other for a while,
and because he speaks German,

35:01.516 --> 35:03.768
I thought I was gonna surprise him
on the trip, you know?

35:03.851 --> 35:06.187
I went on Duolingo,
did a bunch of studying,

35:06.270 --> 35:09.524
and I got to Germany, got over there
and practiced, the whole thing,

35:09.607 --> 35:11.317
got to Switzerland
and was like, "This is it."

35:11.400 --> 35:13.402
I was ready,
like, "I'm gonna surprise my dad."

35:13.486 --> 35:15.196
I planned to get to his house,
knock on the door.

35:15.279 --> 35:17.073
He was gonna open it
and be surprised like, "Trevor!"

35:17.156 --> 35:19.742
Then I would be like,
"<i>Papa! Ich sprechen Deutsch!</i>"

35:19.826 --> 35:23.246
He was gonna be like…

35:23.329 --> 35:25.665
And be like…

35:26.249 --> 35:28.793
It was gonna be a whole thing.
I had it all planned out.

35:29.669 --> 35:30.920
Didn't go according to plan.

35:32.255 --> 35:34.173
I got there.
He was surprised. He was happy.

35:34.257 --> 35:36.843
But as soon as I spoke, like,
"<i>Papa! Ich sprechen Deutsch!</i>"

35:36.926 --> 35:39.512
He was like, "Don't do that.
Don't do that, huh?

35:39.595 --> 35:41.264
No. Don't do that. No."

35:43.558 --> 35:45.643
It's a different world now, man.

35:45.726 --> 35:47.603
It's a different world, isn't it?

35:47.687 --> 35:51.274
Cruise ships? You'll never see
a cruise ship again. Kiss that goodbye.

35:52.066 --> 35:54.652
Our grandkids won't know what a buffet is.

35:55.153 --> 35:56.154
Oh…

35:56.988 --> 35:58.990
Fuck, COVID changed everything.

35:59.073 --> 36:03.911
First off, every cruise ship is booked
up to the year 2026.

36:03.995 --> 36:07.081
People cannot wait
to get aboard the plague barge

36:07.165 --> 36:10.126
and sail the bounding main.

36:12.128 --> 36:14.255
"Oh, let me die near a waterslide!"

36:19.802 --> 36:21.429
Not only are buffets gonna come back,

36:21.512 --> 36:24.724
they're gonna come back with this weird,
"own the libs" vengeance to 'em.

36:24.807 --> 36:26.559
Every single one's gonna have an agenda.

36:26.642 --> 36:30.813
"Come on down to Captain COVID's
Alpha-Males-Only Buffet.

36:33.941 --> 36:35.943
You the kind of left-wing soy boy

36:36.027 --> 36:39.155
that needs a sneeze guard
over your clam chowder?

36:39.238 --> 36:41.824
Or are you able to fuck your wife?

36:41.908 --> 36:45.703
Then come on down to Captain COVID's.

36:49.707 --> 36:51.918
You show us proof
you ain't been vaccinated,

36:52.001 --> 36:55.004
you get a free platter
of room-temperature scallops.

36:57.506 --> 36:58.507
That's right."

37:03.888 --> 37:04.931
Cancel me.

37:06.432 --> 37:08.809
Tell Twitter I told you to say the N-word.

37:09.685 --> 37:12.730
Do it. Cancel me. Cancel me.

37:13.856 --> 37:19.153
If you really think
you have the ability to cancel me,

37:19.237 --> 37:23.157
sitting in your underwear at home,
on your fucking phone, do it.

37:24.408 --> 37:27.328
Cancel me. Cancel me.

37:27.411 --> 37:31.207
I left three countries
with free health care and no guns.

37:36.504 --> 37:40.633
I moved to America in 2015
already prepared to die.

37:45.012 --> 37:49.892
You think MAGA idiots,
Asian hate, uncontrolled COVID,

37:49.976 --> 37:52.979
Twitter people scare me?

37:53.062 --> 37:55.648
Do it. Cancel me. Cancel me.

37:55.731 --> 37:59.443
What are you gonna do? Cancel me
so I have to go back to Malaysia?

37:59.944 --> 38:02.280
Where I'm a national hero?

38:05.574 --> 38:09.370
And the currency advantage
is very much in my favor?

38:10.246 --> 38:12.373
Oh, no!

38:12.456 --> 38:14.583
How will I ever survive?

38:14.667 --> 38:16.168
Do it. Do it.

38:17.044 --> 38:18.713
Free me from this hell.

38:21.674 --> 38:23.134
Welcome to my show.

38:23.217 --> 38:25.761
It's not a show.
There's no dancers or jugglers.

38:25.845 --> 38:27.930
It's basically a bloke talking.

38:28.014 --> 38:31.017
Which is essentially what stand-up comedy
is, isn't it? A bloke talking.

38:31.100 --> 38:32.727
Sexist. Um…

38:37.356 --> 38:40.067
What about all the funny female comedians?

38:40.151 --> 38:41.652
Like, um…

38:42.153 --> 38:45.239
-No. No, no. Right.

38:45.323 --> 38:46.657
No, no, no, no.

38:46.741 --> 38:48.492
I'm not doing that. Okay, right.

38:48.576 --> 38:49.910
That was irony, okay?

38:49.994 --> 38:53.205
There's gonna be a bit of that throughout
the show. See if you can spot it.

38:53.289 --> 38:57.626
Now, that's when I say something
I don't really mean for comic effect,

38:57.710 --> 38:58.836
and you, as an audience,

38:58.919 --> 39:01.881
you laugh at the wrong thing
'cause you know what the right thing is.

39:01.964 --> 39:03.883
It's a way of satirizing attitudes.

39:03.966 --> 39:04.967
Like that first joke.

39:05.051 --> 39:08.179
I used the old-fashioned,
sexist trope that women aren't funny.

39:08.262 --> 39:11.098
Now, in real life,
I know there are loads of funny women.

39:11.182 --> 39:12.391
Like, um…

39:14.643 --> 39:16.228
I did it again. Well spotted. Good.

39:18.064 --> 39:19.273
No, but there are.

39:19.899 --> 39:22.568
Dame Edna Everage. She's…

39:24.278 --> 39:25.279
Uh…

39:27.239 --> 39:28.532
Eddie Izzard.

39:31.994 --> 39:33.788
She's brilliant, isn't she?

39:34.997 --> 39:40.252
She's not only a great comedienne,
she's also a great actress. Isn't she?

39:40.336 --> 39:44.048
She was brilliant
in that thing as that man, wasn't she?

39:47.385 --> 39:49.929
And upgrade your sex toys, goddamn it.

39:50.888 --> 39:53.557
Some of y'all's sex toys
are older than your kids.

39:54.475 --> 39:57.728
Got that same rabbit and tongue,

39:59.563 --> 40:01.816
wand, bullet.

40:01.899 --> 40:05.152
It ain't even a bullet no more.
It's a slingshot and shit.

40:06.320 --> 40:07.655
Upgrade your shit.

40:07.738 --> 40:11.742
There's some new shit out there
right now called "Tracy's Dog."

40:23.212 --> 40:25.589
Those testimonial hollers right there.

40:28.467 --> 40:31.137
Shando, let him use you, sister. Go ahead.

40:35.224 --> 40:39.186
Tracy's Dog.
This motherfucker is serious, you hear me?

40:39.270 --> 40:41.564
It's only 50 motherfucking dollars, yo.

40:41.647 --> 40:44.984
My son's mother, she said, "I can't keep
that motherfucker in the house

40:45.067 --> 40:47.445
'cause I ain't getting shit done
with it in there.

40:47.528 --> 40:50.114
I can't get shit done
with that motherfucker in there."

40:50.197 --> 40:52.741
And this motherfucker 50 fucking dollars,
you hear me?

40:52.825 --> 40:54.452
And it's this U-shaped device, right?

40:54.535 --> 40:57.246
This part go in and vibrating,
then it curve around to the top.

40:57.329 --> 41:00.666
And on top is the sucking mechanism
that go right on the clit.

41:00.749 --> 41:02.668
All it do is suck. Just…

41:05.254 --> 41:08.883
Ten speeds of sucking
on this motherfucker.

41:09.508 --> 41:13.012
This bitch will collapse your forehead,
I promise you.

41:14.763 --> 41:16.098
It's serious.

41:16.182 --> 41:18.267
Now, go ahead. Put it in your phone.
Go ahead.

41:19.018 --> 41:21.145
No, go ahead before you forget.
Put it in your--

41:21.228 --> 41:24.648
Don't worry about who looking at you.
Put it in your phone.

41:25.399 --> 41:26.692
You old women, put it--

41:26.775 --> 41:28.986
You know your mind ain't
like it used to be.

41:29.069 --> 41:31.322
Go ahead.
Put it in your phone before you forget it.

41:31.822 --> 41:33.741
Sitting there,
trying to remember that shit.

41:33.824 --> 41:36.535
"He's so silly.

41:36.619 --> 41:40.164
"Tracy's Dog. Tracy's Dog.
Tracy's Dog. Tracy's Dog.

41:40.664 --> 41:42.833
Tracy's Dog. Tracy's Dog.

41:43.501 --> 41:45.836
Okay, I know a bitch.
She named Tracy. She got a dog.

41:45.920 --> 41:47.338
It's Tracy's…

41:47.421 --> 41:49.590
Okay, Tracy's-- Tracy's Dog."

41:52.593 --> 41:55.679
You putting tape over your camera
on your computer, sir?

41:55.763 --> 41:57.389
You are? I knew it.

41:58.933 --> 42:01.644
Putting tape over your computer camera,
you're like,

42:01.727 --> 42:03.812
"Russia's not gonna see this dick."

42:09.318 --> 42:12.530
"They don't deserve to see
this V-neck and this dick."

42:16.408 --> 42:17.993
You deleting your cookies?

42:19.203 --> 42:23.040
You don't know? You're not sure?
That means, "Yes. Every 20 seconds."

42:24.416 --> 42:26.001
All the guys in my office are like,

42:26.085 --> 42:28.420
"We need a program
that deletes all our cookies."

42:28.504 --> 42:31.382
I'm like, "How much weird-ass porn
are you watching?"

42:31.465 --> 42:35.010
Where's our homey? Where's 65?
Where's our guy? Did he pass on?

42:35.094 --> 42:36.095
Okay, there he is.

42:37.888 --> 42:40.391
Listen to me. They--
If you can hear me, listen.

42:40.474 --> 42:43.477
They watch all the porn on the Internet,

42:43.561 --> 42:46.397
and then they complain
that it doesn't get deleted fast enough.

42:46.480 --> 42:47.731
They have to delete cookies.

42:47.815 --> 42:52.152
Do you have any idea what he had to do
when he wanted to see a pair of titties?

42:54.154 --> 42:56.949
He had to drive into town,

42:58.659 --> 43:01.412
look for a newsstand.

43:01.495 --> 43:04.748
He had to look a grown man in the eye

43:05.833 --> 43:10.421
and say, "I would like
a <i>Big Beaver</i> magazine, please."

43:18.262 --> 43:21.599
His cookies was a human man

43:23.058 --> 43:26.520
who he could run into
at the grocery store or church, whenever.

43:26.604 --> 43:27.855
He never knew.

43:27.938 --> 43:32.067
If he wanted to delete his cookies,
he had to kill his friend.

43:36.447 --> 43:40.367
I saw an article the other day that said
the movie <i>Snow White</i> is now problematic.

43:40.451 --> 43:41.744
And it's like, all right.

43:41.827 --> 43:44.538
Look, if a movie is 75-plus years old,

43:44.622 --> 43:48.917
let's just assume there's a few problems
and go about our day.

43:49.001 --> 43:51.587
We don't need a think piece every time.

43:52.254 --> 43:53.756
But of course, I read the article,

43:53.839 --> 43:55.924
and it said,
"Look, the movie is problematic

43:56.008 --> 44:00.012
because he kisses her and she's sleeping.
There's no consent."

44:00.095 --> 44:03.474
And I was like, "All right. But it was
a quick kiss, and it saved her life."

44:03.557 --> 44:07.645
It's not-- It's not like he's making out
with her while jacking off,

44:07.728 --> 44:10.606
and the dwarves are filming.

44:10.689 --> 44:12.775
It was pretty tastefully done, huh?

44:14.568 --> 44:18.530
I don't think that movie has ever inspired
a sexual assault.

44:19.323 --> 44:23.285
I don't think there's a dude in prison
right now, like, "Disney lied."

44:27.164 --> 44:29.208
If you pass out
and you get kissed by a prince,

44:29.291 --> 44:32.378
it's not-- it's not exactly
the worst-case scenario, you know?

44:32.920 --> 44:34.880
I'm not saying it's okay, but that's--

44:34.963 --> 44:38.717
If you're unconscious, that is most likely
not who's gonna kiss you.

44:44.056 --> 44:46.975
Maybe Prince Andrew,
but normally, you know, it's…

44:47.685 --> 44:49.019
Right? Okay.

44:53.649 --> 44:56.151
Is the canceling real anymore?
I don't know.

44:56.652 --> 45:01.407
Cut to me in a basement in two years,
like, "It's real. It's-- It's very real."

45:01.490 --> 45:04.576
But some of it seems ridiculous.

45:04.660 --> 45:07.913
Like Dr. Seuss last year.
They were like, "He's canceled."

45:07.996 --> 45:10.416
I was like,
"I'm pretty sure he's dead. I don't know--

45:11.291 --> 45:14.211
He's not frantically checking
his Twitter right now."

45:14.920 --> 45:17.089
I saw one that said,
"Dr. Seuss is under fire."

45:17.172 --> 45:21.260
I was like, "He's underground.
He's not-- He's not with us anymore."

45:21.927 --> 45:25.639
I guess he had some racist stuff in some
of the lesser-known children's books.

45:25.722 --> 45:27.850
Of course,
Tucker Carlson comes on the news like,

45:27.933 --> 45:29.601
"They're coming for Seuss.

45:32.312 --> 45:35.190
It's Seuss today.
It could be any of us tomorrow.

45:36.608 --> 45:39.486
You need to pick a side
in the Seuss wars."

45:40.404 --> 45:42.406
There were people spending
thousands of dollars

45:42.489 --> 45:45.159
on the racist Dr. Seuss books
for I don't know what occasion.

45:45.242 --> 45:46.910
I don't know when you break those out.

45:47.411 --> 45:49.496
"Daddy, will you read me <i>Cat in the Hat</i>?"

45:49.580 --> 45:51.707
He's like, "Nah, I got the good shit."

45:52.833 --> 45:55.878
We're gonna do
a little <i>Jew in the Zoo</i> tonight. That's--

46:00.090 --> 46:02.259
The one that broke my heart
more than anything

46:02.342 --> 46:05.762
was when we lost Aretha Franklin,
the Queen of Soul.

46:06.263 --> 46:08.390
Tried to pay my respects
and watch the funeral,

46:08.474 --> 46:10.184
but that funeral was so long.

46:10.934 --> 46:13.228
I kept hollering at the TV, "Let her go."

46:14.313 --> 46:16.231
She's supposed to be with the Lord.

46:16.732 --> 46:19.443
That funeral was so long,
they turned off my cable.

46:20.360 --> 46:23.363
I said, "This funeral
done went through two billing cycles."

46:23.864 --> 46:25.657
They call me,
"Why ain't you paying your bill?"

46:25.741 --> 46:27.326
I said, "I'm still at the funeral."

46:28.952 --> 46:29.953
Let her go.

46:30.954 --> 46:33.582
I never seen
a pastor preach the whole Bible.

46:34.750 --> 46:36.752
This nigga didn't miss a scripture.

46:37.377 --> 46:39.171
I knew we were gonna be there a long time

46:39.254 --> 46:41.840
'cause the nigga come out talking about,
"In the beginning…"

46:42.716 --> 46:44.134
I said, "The beginning?"

46:45.719 --> 46:48.055
What do Adam and Eve got to do
with a funeral?

46:48.555 --> 46:51.517
Let her go.
She's supposed to be with the Lord.

46:52.142 --> 46:54.102
CNN was there.
They was unplugging their shit.

46:54.186 --> 46:55.938
"Come on. Let's get the fuck out of here."

46:57.147 --> 46:58.815
We've been here for three weeks.

46:59.316 --> 47:01.735
Don Lemon supposed to be on TV right now.

47:02.444 --> 47:04.696
I kept hollering at the TV, "Let her go!"

47:05.197 --> 47:08.575
I knew it was long
when Aretha got up to change dresses.

47:10.619 --> 47:14.248
"I'm gonna wear something different
in the second half of the funeral."

47:14.331 --> 47:16.375
I said, "The second half?

47:17.167 --> 47:19.586
Who has a halftime at a funeral?"

47:20.128 --> 47:23.298
Let her go.
She's supposed to be with the Lord.

47:24.633 --> 47:28.220
That funeral was so long, nigga,
they held her in Detroit so long,

47:28.303 --> 47:32.558
by the time she finally did make it
to the Pearly Gates to get into heaven,

47:32.641 --> 47:35.769
an angel came to the door
and said, "God gone."

47:37.604 --> 47:39.856
You supposed to been here three weeks ago.

47:39.940 --> 47:42.359
He touched you on the third.
It's the 21st.

47:43.402 --> 47:45.654
I know you the queen, but he the king.

47:46.947 --> 47:50.158
You just can't have
the Lord just waiting for you, Aretha.

47:50.242 --> 47:51.952
This is no kind of respect.

47:54.830 --> 47:58.041
Florida's got a new bill.
People call it the Don't Say Gay bill.

47:58.125 --> 48:01.211
One of the provisions
in this bill that they dropped

48:01.295 --> 48:04.506
was that teachers were gonna have to
out kids as gay

48:04.590 --> 48:06.800
to their parents within six months.

48:06.883 --> 48:10.178
Which is horrible but hilarious.

48:11.597 --> 48:15.559
When you think of the calls
the teachers would have to make…

48:17.603 --> 48:19.730
"Hey, Mr. Morris. How are you? Yeah.

48:20.314 --> 48:21.982
I'm Todd's English teacher.

48:22.608 --> 48:25.986
Yeah, he's doing great. No, no problems.
He's doing great.

48:26.069 --> 48:28.905
He is very close with another boy though.

48:30.282 --> 48:32.951
They laugh a lot.
They take the bus together.

48:33.535 --> 48:35.037
Oh, that's his brother?

48:35.704 --> 48:37.539
Okay. No, nothing. Nothing, uh…

48:40.000 --> 48:42.628
Nothing at all.
How are you? Are you good?

48:43.128 --> 48:45.547
Yeah, I'm just checking up on everybody."

48:47.507 --> 48:49.926
I would call. I'd give it no context.

48:50.636 --> 48:51.970
"Hey, Mrs. Miller.

48:52.596 --> 48:54.765
Your daughter's a les."

48:58.393 --> 49:00.020
Let them figure it out.

49:01.521 --> 49:02.606
You know?

49:02.689 --> 49:05.901
It also makes teachers look horrible,
you know?

49:05.984 --> 49:09.321
"I watched your son jerk off
with his friend. I think they're gay.

49:09.946 --> 49:13.367
No, I did. I-- I filmed it.
I knew you wouldn't believe me.

49:14.534 --> 49:17.037
Do you want to see it? It's my job.

49:17.120 --> 49:20.582
No, it's my job. I'm a teacher."

49:25.003 --> 49:28.131
I'm so sick of motherfuckers
talking shit about Joe Biden.

49:28.799 --> 49:31.093
"Joe need to get his shit together."

49:33.136 --> 49:35.097
"You need to wake up, Joe."

49:38.350 --> 49:40.394
"Go Brandon, Joe."

49:43.730 --> 49:45.732
The fuck is wrong with you people?

49:46.400 --> 49:48.026
Who raised you?

49:50.070 --> 49:53.949
Joe Biden is
96 motherfucking years old, bitch.

49:56.076 --> 49:58.870
You gave pawpaw the job, bitch.

50:00.163 --> 50:04.000
You gave great-granddaddy the job, bitch.

50:05.335 --> 50:08.547
Now you want
big daddy to get his shit together?

50:10.674 --> 50:13.844
Joe Biden is doing the best
he motherfucking can.

50:14.886 --> 50:17.472
That man is 97 years old.

50:21.435 --> 50:23.854
People talking shit about Joe Biden.

50:23.937 --> 50:26.982
"I don't like
the way he left Afghanistan."

50:27.566 --> 50:31.737
Bitch, how the fuck do you think
a 98-year-old man leave a fight?

50:34.239 --> 50:36.575
Quickly and quietly, bitch.

50:39.244 --> 50:41.121
Joe Biden left Afghanistan like this.

50:50.881 --> 50:53.091
Joe is doing the best he fucking can.

50:54.468 --> 50:58.096
Give him a fucking break.
Joe is 99 goddamn years--

51:04.144 --> 51:06.146
If you lucky enough
to have a great-granddaddy,

51:06.229 --> 51:07.856
call him up right now on the phone

51:07.939 --> 51:12.319
and ask him is he ready to do
12 press conferences tomorrow, bitch.

51:13.069 --> 51:14.696
No, he is not.

51:19.618 --> 51:21.912
I mean, does anyone here
look in the mirror

51:21.995 --> 51:23.413
and feel good about what they see?

51:23.497 --> 51:24.998
-No.
-Yeah.

51:25.081 --> 51:28.418
Yeah. There's usually one guy and Lizzo.

51:33.632 --> 51:34.841
You know?

51:34.925 --> 51:36.134
And I get it with Lizzo.

51:36.218 --> 51:38.970
She plays the flute.
It's very sexy. It's cool.

51:40.472 --> 51:43.642
But who's that guy? I mean,
you know those guys that are just like…

51:51.942 --> 51:54.903
Like, the sun is always in their eyes,
you know what I mean?

51:57.948 --> 52:00.283
Always touching their chests, you know?

52:07.707 --> 52:10.252
I'm like, what is the--
What is his morning like?

52:11.378 --> 52:14.005
You know? Does he look in the mirror,
and he's just like…

52:15.382 --> 52:16.800
"Fucking nailed it.

52:19.803 --> 52:22.097
All right. Let's start the day, Jake."

52:25.308 --> 52:28.061
That is not what my morning is like, okay?

52:28.144 --> 52:31.606
I do everything in my power
to be as attractive as possible.

52:31.690 --> 52:36.152
And tonight, that's to look like one of
Christopher from <i>The Sopranos</i>' friends.

52:38.530 --> 52:39.990
"How you doing?

52:40.073 --> 52:43.368
Hey, Chris, are you gonna talk
to your uncle Tony for me?"

52:44.160 --> 52:47.330
I do everything in my power,
and then I look in the mirror.

52:47.414 --> 52:50.125
And the voice that I hear
when I look in the mirror

52:50.208 --> 52:52.168
is like an English bully.

52:53.128 --> 52:54.629
You know, he's just like…

52:54.713 --> 52:59.551
…"Look at you.
You fat fucking iguana."

53:01.928 --> 53:06.016
The voice I hear might be
British action star Jason Statham.

53:08.351 --> 53:11.354
"Why are you
so red when you get out the shower?"

53:12.230 --> 53:13.648
"Cause I have eczema."

53:13.732 --> 53:16.610
"Yeah, you got eczemas, don't you?

53:17.193 --> 53:19.654
And what makes the eczema flare up?"

53:20.572 --> 53:21.573
"Dairy."

53:21.656 --> 53:24.534
"You're still
eating lots of ice creams, aren't you?"

53:24.618 --> 53:25.619
"Yeah."

53:25.702 --> 53:27.120
"And tree nuts."

53:27.203 --> 53:29.039
"Yeah, I'm not supposed to eat cashew--"

53:29.122 --> 53:32.208
"Yeah, you're
not supposed to eat cashews, are you?

53:33.209 --> 53:35.629
-What are you gonna do about it?"
-"I guess I should go--"

53:35.712 --> 53:37.172
"To the chemist?"

53:37.255 --> 53:38.548
"We call it a pharmacy."

53:38.632 --> 53:41.009
"Yeah, I bet you fucking do.

53:43.303 --> 53:48.808
Why don't you go down to the pharmacy
and get your fragrance-free moisturizers

53:49.392 --> 53:53.396
and get your jumbo pack
of children's melatonin?"

53:54.397 --> 53:55.398
"'The regular--"

53:55.482 --> 53:57.150
"'Cause the regular stuff

53:57.233 --> 53:59.444
makes you groggy in the morning,
doesn't it?

54:00.654 --> 54:02.530
And then you walk out of the pharmacy,

54:02.614 --> 54:04.616
-and what did you forg--"
-"I forgot my eczema--"

54:04.699 --> 54:07.869
"Yeah, you forgot your eczema creams!

54:08.703 --> 54:10.997
So why don't you get the fuck out of here,

54:11.081 --> 54:15.251
you fat, forgetful,
amphibious, red, rashy,

54:15.335 --> 54:20.173
pathetic, Semitic fucking nobody?"

54:25.679 --> 54:29.307
And then I look in the mirror
and I'm like, "Let's start the day."

54:32.602 --> 54:35.689
They wanted a dog. I don't want no dog.
You understand?

54:35.772 --> 54:39.317
First of all, dogs got different lives
than they had when I came up.

54:39.401 --> 54:40.402
Understand? I don't dig--

54:40.485 --> 54:43.738
You new dog owners, y'all doing too much.
I'm telling you that right now.

54:43.822 --> 54:45.699
You got 'em in the grocery store,

54:45.782 --> 54:49.452
you walking around with 'em and shit
in little bags.

54:49.536 --> 54:52.664
I flew here first-class
with a poodle next to me,

54:52.747 --> 54:54.457
looking at me like,
"What the fuck you doing here?"

54:54.541 --> 54:56.543
No, bitch, what the fuck you doing here?

54:57.419 --> 54:59.462
Y'all got your mouth in their mouth.

54:59.546 --> 55:01.423
"Oh, my God, I love you so much."

55:01.506 --> 55:04.300
But you won't get the vaccine.
But this right here…

55:07.012 --> 55:09.472
But this, "I don't want that in my body!

55:09.556 --> 55:12.392
But my dog,
who's been licking his balls all day…"

55:13.351 --> 55:14.853
Get the fuck out of here.

55:17.605 --> 55:19.607
I was like, "Why did I want a dog?"

55:19.691 --> 55:22.027
You know what I mean?
Like, I had a dog coming up.

55:22.110 --> 55:24.821
And then it hit me.
I went, "I had a dog coming up.

55:24.904 --> 55:26.322
And it was horrible."

55:26.906 --> 55:28.992
One of my biggest childhood pains

55:29.075 --> 55:31.870
is connected to one of my dogs
when I grew up.

55:31.953 --> 55:34.706
I grew up here in Cleveland, Ohio.
I'll never forget. I was about eight.

55:34.789 --> 55:38.793
And I was standing in the doorway,
dog was outside on the tree lawn peeing.

55:38.877 --> 55:43.590
Outside, a car pulls up, opens the door,
grabs the dog, drives away.

55:43.673 --> 55:45.508
-I said, "What?"

55:47.802 --> 55:49.846
I said, "Dad, they got the dog!"

55:51.306 --> 55:55.185
This is all my father had to give me
in this horrible moment in my life.

55:55.268 --> 55:56.394
He went, "Aw!

56:03.568 --> 56:04.903
All right, come on in the house."

56:04.986 --> 56:06.404
I said, "Wait a minute!"

56:08.073 --> 56:10.116
I was like, "You're not gonna do shit?"

56:10.200 --> 56:12.494
Now he's mad at me.
"What the fuck you want me to do?

56:12.577 --> 56:13.703
The dog is gone."

56:14.329 --> 56:17.999
I said, "Goddamn. We're not supposed
to care about these dogs!"

56:19.459 --> 56:21.711
For years this haunted me.

56:21.795 --> 56:25.715
And I came up at a time where you didn't
talk to your parents about your feelings.

56:25.799 --> 56:29.135
You just processed that shit through
your own little eight-year-old mind.

56:29.219 --> 56:31.596
And for years,
I would run that through my head.

56:31.679 --> 56:36.476
Like, you know, I understand why
he came out and looked that way.

56:37.685 --> 56:39.938
Because that's the way they drove off.

56:43.775 --> 56:45.735
But what the fuck
you looking back here for?

56:47.028 --> 56:49.948
Like you thought they're gonna
go around the block with the car

56:50.031 --> 56:51.074
and come back with the dog?

56:51.157 --> 56:53.284
"There you go.
I was fucking with you. There's your dog."

56:56.079 --> 56:59.249
Look at Ice Cube.
Ice Cube doesn't wanna get the vaccine.

56:59.332 --> 57:01.876
He was supposed to do
this movie called <i>Oh Hell No</i>,

57:01.960 --> 57:05.880
which, sadly, we'll never see. And…

57:10.635 --> 57:13.555
He was supposed to get the vaccine,
and he wouldn't do it.

57:14.055 --> 57:15.849
But you know what's weird?

57:15.932 --> 57:20.395
A few months before the pandemic,
Ice Cube got a colonoscopy.

57:21.187 --> 57:23.440
You know what a colonoscopy is?

57:24.190 --> 57:26.317
Basically, Ice Cube went to the doctor.

57:26.401 --> 57:28.820
The doctor was like,
"You got a problem in your stomach,

57:28.903 --> 57:30.697
and we need to do a colonoscopy."

57:30.780 --> 57:32.365
And he was like, "What's that?"

57:32.449 --> 57:36.744
And they're like,
"Uh, well, sit down, Ice Cube.

57:39.247 --> 57:41.749
Basically, you need to drink
a gallon of fluid

57:41.833 --> 57:43.626
and just shit out everything in your body.

57:43.710 --> 57:45.462
Just clean out your system, right?

57:45.545 --> 57:47.464
Next day, you come in,
we'll put you under,

57:47.547 --> 57:50.675
and we'll shove a rubber hose
up your asshole

57:50.758 --> 57:52.385
that's got a camera on the end of it.

57:52.469 --> 57:55.305
We'll go in there, film for a few hours,
and see what's going on.

57:55.388 --> 57:58.516
And we'll run some tests,
and when we're done, we'll wake you up."

57:59.267 --> 58:02.562
And he was like, "All right.
Well, do what you gotta do."

58:03.605 --> 58:05.815
He didn't say any of the shit
he's saying now.

58:05.899 --> 58:09.068
He wasn't like out there like,
"I gotta understand the science."

58:09.861 --> 58:13.323
He wasn't out there like,
"My butthole, my rights." No.

58:13.823 --> 58:18.536
He was passed out
with four strangers around him.

58:18.620 --> 58:20.538
They were like,
"We're having a little trouble."

58:20.622 --> 58:22.540
He's like, "You can do it.
Put your back into it."

58:25.418 --> 58:29.088
They-- They were in there for hours.

58:29.172 --> 58:31.174
For hours.

58:31.257 --> 58:34.594
What were they doing?
Filming a limited series?

58:34.677 --> 58:38.973
Does season 2 of <i>Queen's Gambit</i>
take place in Ice Cube's large intestine?

58:45.939 --> 58:48.983
I don't know
if Ice Cube's had a colonoscopy. Uh…

58:50.485 --> 58:54.948
But… he's--

58:56.324 --> 58:59.202
He's over 45 years old.
He should have had one.

58:59.285 --> 59:02.497
It's-- It's a screening colonoscopy.

59:02.580 --> 59:04.624
It's to make sure
you don't have colon cancer.

59:04.707 --> 59:07.252
So, let's hope my joke is true.

59:10.338 --> 59:14.801
I am breaking the cycle
of generational trauma.

59:15.385 --> 59:16.803
And it's a lot of work, okay?

59:16.886 --> 59:18.471
So, here's what I've done so far.

59:18.555 --> 59:20.974
So, it's like a decade in therapy.

59:21.558 --> 59:25.228
And then every day, okay,
I wake up, I practice my gratitude,

59:25.311 --> 59:28.273
and then I drink my coffee, I take a shit.

59:30.191 --> 59:35.280
I exercise because the endorphins
from exercise help fight depression.

59:35.363 --> 59:39.450
And then I adhere to a low-carbohydrate,
high-protein diet,

59:39.534 --> 59:41.244
I meditate twice a day,

59:41.327 --> 59:44.497
I feel all my dumb feelings…

59:47.333 --> 59:49.961
…and I am still so fucked up.

59:50.044 --> 59:53.881
Like, I'm--
I'm so fucking crazy.

59:56.551 --> 59:58.761
Thank you. Mmm.

59:58.845 --> 1:00:00.346
Woo!

1:00:04.017 --> 1:00:06.102
But…

1:00:06.185 --> 1:00:09.188
But I'm trying, and I'm in the game.

1:00:09.272 --> 1:00:11.316
And I'm gonna do it, man.

1:00:11.399 --> 1:00:13.651
I'm gonna do it. Yeah.

1:00:17.071 --> 1:00:19.824
Yeah, 'cause my childhood was wacky, like…

1:00:19.907 --> 1:00:24.287
Well, put it this way. Like, growing up,
I couldn't understand, like--

1:00:24.370 --> 1:00:27.999
I couldn't understand those people
who lived at home in their twenties.

1:00:28.082 --> 1:00:30.835
You know, like, dude,
I wanted out at six, bro.

1:00:30.918 --> 1:00:34.005
I was like,
"Where's my letter to Hogwarts?

1:00:34.088 --> 1:00:35.882
Get me the fuck out of this."

1:00:36.633 --> 1:00:41.137
You know, I would have rather lived
with those bitches from <i>The Facts of Life</i>

1:00:42.513 --> 1:00:45.933
and get scissored by that lesbo Jo.
Remember Jo?

1:00:46.601 --> 1:00:49.020
You guys know Jo was a lesbo, right?

1:00:50.021 --> 1:00:52.690
Yeah, 'cause she had a ponytail…

1:00:55.193 --> 1:00:57.445
and she was a…
…mechanic.

1:00:59.197 --> 1:01:02.742
A pussy mechanic, am I right? Yeah!

1:01:06.871 --> 1:01:09.582
My son's really good at basketball.
He has a nice jump shot.

1:01:09.666 --> 1:01:11.959
He always wants to play one-on-one
with me, but it leaves my daughter out.

1:01:12.043 --> 1:01:14.295
She has nothing to do.
So one day I hand her a little ball.

1:01:14.379 --> 1:01:16.339
I say, "Sweetie,
you play with this ball here.

1:01:16.422 --> 1:01:18.800
When me and your brother are done,
I'll play with you."

1:01:18.883 --> 1:01:20.718
We start playing. She drops the ball.

1:01:20.802 --> 1:01:23.554
It rolls into our game, disrupts us.
We have to stop.

1:01:23.638 --> 1:01:27.684
My son's already in a bad mood,
and he loses his shit.

1:01:27.767 --> 1:01:30.687
Right, he picks up the ball up,
and he's going, "No, no, no, no.

1:01:31.938 --> 1:01:33.856
No, no, no, no, no."

1:01:33.940 --> 1:01:35.775
And I go,
"Whoa, buddy, what are you doing?

1:01:35.858 --> 1:01:38.194
What are you gonna do?
Throw the ball at your sister?"

1:01:38.277 --> 1:01:39.862
He goes, "I'm tired of this, Dad."

1:01:39.946 --> 1:01:42.573
I go, "Buddy, you're 12.
You're not tired of shit, okay?

1:01:42.657 --> 1:01:44.492
I'm tired. I'm tired.

1:01:44.575 --> 1:01:47.995
Me and your mother might get divorced
from what happened at breakfast, okay?

1:01:48.830 --> 1:01:51.082
There's gonna be another guy named Phil
living here in six months.

1:01:51.165 --> 1:01:52.291
Give her the ball back."

1:01:55.086 --> 1:01:57.922
And my daughter's going,
"Lucas, can I have the ball?" Right?

1:01:58.005 --> 1:02:00.842
And I go, "Do the right thing
and hand it to her. Hand it." Right?

1:02:00.925 --> 1:02:04.721
And in anger and disgust,
he bounced it at her hard.

1:02:04.804 --> 1:02:06.723
Hits her nose and lip, splits her lip.

1:02:06.806 --> 1:02:08.850
She's bleeding, screaming, crying.

1:02:08.933 --> 1:02:11.102
And it is an absolute shit show.

1:02:11.936 --> 1:02:15.523
So now I need to console my little girl
and scold my boy at the same time.

1:02:15.606 --> 1:02:17.775
I'm going, "Sweetie, I'm so sorry.
We're gonna clean that up.

1:02:17.859 --> 1:02:21.028
What are you, nuts? She's bleeding
and crying 'cause of your attitude.

1:02:21.112 --> 1:02:22.321
I hope you feel good about that.

1:02:22.405 --> 1:02:23.698
I'm so sorry. Give me one second.

1:02:23.781 --> 1:02:26.284
You wanna play one-on-one?
We're gonna play right now, me and you.

1:02:26.367 --> 1:02:29.370
You wanna play like that with your sister?
My ball first. My house."

1:02:29.454 --> 1:02:31.164
So I back him to the hole hard.

1:02:33.291 --> 1:02:34.584
Back him to the hole hard.

1:02:34.667 --> 1:02:37.670
Layup. One-nothing. Let's go.
Make it, take it. My house. Respect.

1:02:38.463 --> 1:02:42.300
I get it again. Boom.
Ten-footer. Nothing but net. Swish.

1:02:42.383 --> 1:02:44.260
I go, "You get your shot from me.
Let's go."

1:02:44.343 --> 1:02:45.553
Now he starts getting amped up.

1:02:45.636 --> 1:02:47.180
Guys, on the third possession,

1:02:47.263 --> 1:02:49.265
my son legitimately steals the ball
from me.

1:02:49.348 --> 1:02:51.184
I tried to get it behind my back.
He steals it.

1:02:51.267 --> 1:02:53.811
He starts running towards the hoop.
He's all blushing and into it.

1:02:53.895 --> 1:02:56.022
And he pulls up an eight-footer.
Nothing but net.

1:02:56.105 --> 1:02:57.607
He steps up to me. He chested up.

1:02:57.690 --> 1:03:00.443
He looked at me, and he just goes,
"Let's fucking go."

1:03:11.329 --> 1:03:14.540
"What? What did you just say to me?"

1:03:14.624 --> 1:03:16.042
He goes, "Let's go?"

1:03:16.125 --> 1:03:19.754
I go, "Go sit on the wall for five minutes
and think about what you just--

1:03:19.837 --> 1:03:22.673
I am your father. You never speak to me
like that. Are you out of your mind?"

1:03:22.757 --> 1:03:23.966
I turned and thought to myself,

1:03:24.050 --> 1:03:27.553
"That was the greatest shit
I have ever seen in my fucking life!

1:03:27.637 --> 1:03:28.971
My son is the man!"

1:03:30.640 --> 1:03:33.518
Yeah, one month into COVID,
my mom's flip phone broke.

1:03:33.601 --> 1:03:36.395
And so we bought her
her very first iPhone.

1:03:36.479 --> 1:03:38.272
And if you were to say to me tonight,

1:03:38.356 --> 1:03:43.486
"Jeff, would you rather
teach your mother how to text

1:03:43.569 --> 1:03:46.364
or teach your dog how to wipe his ass?"

1:03:48.366 --> 1:03:50.868
I would probably say,
"Hand me the toilet paper.

1:03:50.952 --> 1:03:52.912
Let me give that a shot."

1:03:55.456 --> 1:03:58.835
The texting has been
a little bit of a challenge.

1:03:58.918 --> 1:04:01.546
And my daughters were
so excited, you know,

1:04:01.629 --> 1:04:05.091
that their gabba was finally texting,
so they're texting her.

1:04:05.174 --> 1:04:07.510
One night, I get a call from my mom,

1:04:07.593 --> 1:04:11.180
and sh-she says to me, "What is 'lo'?"

1:04:13.474 --> 1:04:14.934
I said, "What are you talking about?"

1:04:15.017 --> 1:04:19.564
She said, "Jordan sent me a text,
and at the end of it, it said 'lo.'"

1:04:20.481 --> 1:04:23.901
I said, "How do you spell it?"
She said, "L-O-L."

1:04:24.861 --> 1:04:27.822
I said, "Mom, that's not 'lo.'
That's 'laugh out loud.'"

1:04:27.905 --> 1:04:29.615
I said, "That's what the kids do now.

1:04:29.699 --> 1:04:33.828
Instead of writing everything out,
you know, they just use initials.

1:04:33.911 --> 1:04:37.456
Like 'I-D-K' is 'I don't know.'
'O-M-G' is 'Oh, my gosh.'"

1:04:37.540 --> 1:04:39.000
I said, "That's how they do it."

1:04:39.500 --> 1:04:44.755
Few nights later,
I get a text from my mother that says,

1:04:44.839 --> 1:04:50.761
"I-Y-G-T-T-G-S-I-N-S-K."

1:04:56.267 --> 1:04:58.728
I'm like, "Oh, God. Mom's had a stroke."

1:05:00.980 --> 1:05:04.400
I called her up and said,
"Mom, what did you just text me?"

1:05:04.483 --> 1:05:07.486
She said, "I was doing like the girls do.

1:05:07.570 --> 1:05:12.033
I said, 'If you go to the grocery store,
I need some ketchup.'"

1:05:15.202 --> 1:05:17.538
Well, of course. Why didn't I see that?

1:05:21.334 --> 1:05:22.460
Orgasms are wild, though.

1:05:22.543 --> 1:05:26.130
The differences between the male orgasm
and the female orgasm, insane.

1:05:26.213 --> 1:05:29.008
Like, the male orgasm, as we all know,
it's very straightforward.

1:05:29.091 --> 1:05:30.092
It's like <i>Mario Kart</i>.

1:05:30.176 --> 1:05:32.678
You just go around the track enough times,
and you've won.

1:05:33.262 --> 1:05:35.431
Whereas the female orgasm,
from what I'm told,

1:05:35.514 --> 1:05:38.392
it's very much like you're entering
a maze, and there's a sphinx,

1:05:38.476 --> 1:05:41.354
and he's like, "I only tell the truth,
and my brother only tells lies."

1:05:41.437 --> 1:05:44.649
And you sort of have to solve that riddle,

1:05:44.732 --> 1:05:46.776
get to the middle of the maze
and defeat the Minotaur,

1:05:46.859 --> 1:05:49.445
and then maybe you'll find the G-spot.
You don't know!

1:05:49.528 --> 1:05:51.822
The way we talk about the G-spot
in this culture,

1:05:51.906 --> 1:05:55.534
it's as thought it moves about the body,
every night, a different location,

1:05:55.618 --> 1:05:57.286
like the Room of fucking Requirement.

1:05:57.370 --> 1:05:59.705
It is absolutely nuts.

1:05:59.789 --> 1:06:03.376
Like, I just don't think
it could be that difficult.

1:06:03.459 --> 1:06:05.795
You only ever hear
it's hard to make a woman come

1:06:05.878 --> 1:06:07.964
in the context
of heterosexual relationships.

1:06:08.047 --> 1:06:09.674
You never hear that from queer women,

1:06:09.757 --> 1:06:12.468
and I wonder what the missing piece
of the equation is.

1:06:12.551 --> 1:06:15.513
-You know? Like… Like, honestly.

1:06:17.139 --> 1:06:18.140
No, stop.

1:06:20.685 --> 1:06:23.187
I will not let this descend
into "clapter."

1:06:24.772 --> 1:06:27.942
You either laugh and clap or none. Okay?

1:06:31.904 --> 1:06:35.449
I don't think it could be that difficult,
though, to make a woman come.

1:06:35.533 --> 1:06:38.661
Like, honestly,
I think I could do it.

1:06:38.744 --> 1:06:41.205
-I do. Put me in, Coach. You know?

1:06:41.288 --> 1:06:43.165
Like, I just-- I think I could do it.

1:06:43.249 --> 1:06:45.668
I haven't spent a lot of time down there,
but I love a puzzle,

1:06:45.751 --> 1:06:49.338
so I just feel like I would approach it
like any escape room.

1:06:49.422 --> 1:06:52.383
Just hit all the corners
and then get out of there. You know?

1:06:53.217 --> 1:06:56.512
So with that in mind, ma'am,
if you could come up here on the stool.

1:06:56.595 --> 1:06:59.974
If I could get my beach towel flown in,
please, that would be really great.

1:07:00.057 --> 1:07:02.309
I'm just kidding, but what if I wasn't?

1:07:02.393 --> 1:07:05.563
Like, what if you were watching
this Netflix special, and you were like,

1:07:05.646 --> 1:07:09.859
"Oh, my God. A gay Asian man
just got a woman off live on stage."

1:07:10.735 --> 1:07:12.862
Who said theater was dead?

1:07:15.489 --> 1:07:19.660
I have a lot of new traits now.
I recently went to Chipotle at 10:45 a.m.

1:07:19.744 --> 1:07:20.786
Doctor's orders.

1:07:23.456 --> 1:07:24.915
And when I walked in, I was like…

1:07:25.750 --> 1:07:28.753
'Cause I'm cool. When I walk into
a Chipotle, I'm not-- Up here, I'm all…

1:07:28.836 --> 1:07:31.088
At Chipotle, I'm like--
I get it. I'm like…

1:07:37.386 --> 1:07:39.722
So I walk into a Chipotle,
and the guy working there--

1:07:39.805 --> 1:07:41.932
Yes, a man. Important for the story.

1:07:42.683 --> 1:07:44.185
He's like, "What do you want?"

1:07:44.268 --> 1:07:47.688
And I'm like, "Okay, he wants to have
raw-dog sex with me."

1:07:49.982 --> 1:07:55.488
Now I say, "Hello.
I would like a chicken burrito bowl.

1:07:55.571 --> 1:07:58.866
I know guac is extra,
and I'll take the hottest sauce."

1:07:58.949 --> 1:08:03.287
He goes… …"You sure?"

1:08:07.958 --> 1:08:13.422
I was like…
…"Oh, my God. Am I sure?

1:08:15.299 --> 1:08:16.842
Mmm.

1:08:17.927 --> 1:08:20.096
I don't know.

1:08:20.679 --> 1:08:23.307
I never thought about it before.

1:08:26.477 --> 1:08:29.730
I don't think about big-boy questions
like that.

1:08:30.981 --> 1:08:33.734
I'm just a little girlie.

1:08:33.818 --> 1:08:38.197
I think about little girlie things
like earrings and shoes.

1:08:38.280 --> 1:08:40.324
I don't know about big-boy stuff
like that.

1:08:40.407 --> 1:08:42.701
I'm just a little baby with titties.
I'm just"--

1:08:45.204 --> 1:08:47.414
Oh, I'm sorry.
I just completely blacked out.

1:08:47.498 --> 1:08:48.582
Did I do something?

1:08:50.292 --> 1:08:52.378
Wait, did I say something annoying?

1:08:55.089 --> 1:08:58.342
Let me be real with you.
You've followed my journey from the start.

1:08:58.425 --> 1:09:00.177
Life hasn't always been show business.

1:09:00.261 --> 1:09:04.014
There's been times in my life where
I've been broke. Like, "broke" broke.

1:09:04.098 --> 1:09:07.309
You know, you ever been so broke you pray?
You ever done that?

1:09:07.393 --> 1:09:09.186
You're not even religious.

1:09:09.270 --> 1:09:11.772
You start praying.
You don't even know how to pray.

1:09:11.856 --> 1:09:14.483
"Uh, yeah. Um, yeah.

1:09:15.067 --> 1:09:17.611
I don't know who's up there.
Buddha, one of you, listen.

1:09:18.362 --> 1:09:20.114
I beg you, please.

1:09:20.197 --> 1:09:24.326
If there's any way that Our Father
can walk through the shadow of death

1:09:24.410 --> 1:09:28.330
and find me some kind of sign for money"--

1:09:28.414 --> 1:09:33.669
Even while you're negotiating
with the Lord, it doesn't even make sense.

1:09:33.752 --> 1:09:36.088
"If you can find me a sign of money,

1:09:36.172 --> 1:09:39.300
I promise I will never swear again
in my life."

1:09:39.383 --> 1:09:40.384
What?

1:09:41.510 --> 1:09:42.511
Real broke, man.

1:09:45.139 --> 1:09:48.559
It's over for white people. It's 100%--
We had a nice run.

1:09:48.642 --> 1:09:53.522
Listen, white people,
we had a nice run, but, baby, it's over.

1:09:53.606 --> 1:09:55.858
Okay? Make no mistake.

1:09:55.941 --> 1:09:59.195
Facedown. Done. Over. Never coming back.

1:09:59.278 --> 1:10:03.407
But, I mean, hall of fame historically.
Really, a lot of good things.

1:10:03.490 --> 1:10:08.204
Also a lot of bad things.
But brush over it, you know?

1:10:08.746 --> 1:10:11.332
But it's over. It's over for whites.
And I knew that.

1:10:11.415 --> 1:10:13.709
I felt that about seven years ago.

1:10:13.792 --> 1:10:18.130
I felt that coming.
I felt the tide turning for the whites.

1:10:18.214 --> 1:10:21.091
I looked in the mirror,
I said, "Uh-oh, SpaghettiO.

1:10:22.343 --> 1:10:25.930
Chris, you are"--
'Cause I am, like, skin-condition white.

1:10:26.013 --> 1:10:28.015
Like, I am supremely white.

1:10:28.098 --> 1:10:31.143
And it's just-- I knew.
So I had to make a decision.

1:10:31.227 --> 1:10:34.897
'Cause I deliberately, on purpose--
Both my daughters are Puerto Rican.

1:10:34.980 --> 1:10:38.234
-I have-- Yes. Latina children. Thank you.

1:10:38.317 --> 1:10:39.318
Ooh.

1:10:40.945 --> 1:10:44.240
I have Latina kids and-- Again, by design.

1:10:44.323 --> 1:10:48.827
I went out to a bar seven years ago.
It's called "Place to Beach."

1:10:48.911 --> 1:10:51.872
It's still there, actually.
It's in Coney Island, Brooklyn.

1:10:51.956 --> 1:10:53.499
Google it. Yeah, Place to Beach.

1:10:53.582 --> 1:10:57.586
Yeah, I bought my fake vaccine card there
with a mai tai.

1:10:59.338 --> 1:11:00.881
And-- From Vito.

1:11:00.965 --> 1:11:04.760
He's dead of COVID, but what can you do?

1:11:06.512 --> 1:11:09.139
I like doctors.
I like specialists though, you know?

1:11:09.223 --> 1:11:10.891
Like, this is what I don't understand.

1:11:10.975 --> 1:11:13.352
Your foot hurts,
so you wanna go to the foot doctor.

1:11:13.435 --> 1:11:14.603
You phone the foot doctor, he goes,

1:11:14.687 --> 1:11:16.480
"You can't come.
You gotta go to a regular doctor."

1:11:16.563 --> 1:11:18.857
So then you go to the regular doctor,
and he goes,

1:11:18.941 --> 1:11:21.277
"Yeah, you gotta go to a foot doctor.

1:11:21.360 --> 1:11:24.280
Yeah, just pay Agnes 80 bucks
on the way out."

1:11:24.363 --> 1:11:26.448
What is that scam, you know?

1:11:27.199 --> 1:11:28.409
You go, "All right."

1:11:28.993 --> 1:11:31.829
He goes, "While you're here,
want me to take your blood pressure?"

1:11:31.912 --> 1:11:36.250
I'm like, "No, that's fine. I've had my
blood pressure taken about 5,000 times."

1:11:37.001 --> 1:11:38.502
Don't even know what it means.

1:11:38.585 --> 1:11:40.587
They go, "It's 150 over 60."

1:11:40.671 --> 1:11:43.173
I go, "Is that good?"
They go, "It's… I don't know.

1:11:43.257 --> 1:11:44.258
It's all a blur.

1:11:45.009 --> 1:11:46.010
I'm a doctor.

1:11:47.011 --> 1:11:49.847
I'm gonna be hitting your knee
with a hammer now."

1:11:49.930 --> 1:11:53.892
That's the oddest one to me of all time.

1:11:53.976 --> 1:11:55.644
We haven't gotten past that?

1:11:55.728 --> 1:11:58.564
That's like a cartoon from the 1950s.

1:11:58.647 --> 1:12:01.483
Guy pulls out a hammer,
hits your knee with it,

1:12:01.567 --> 1:12:04.737
and then you go, "Ah, my knee!
Oh, my God, that hurts."

1:12:04.820 --> 1:12:08.866
And then the guy writes down,
"Excellent. Very good."

1:12:09.491 --> 1:12:14.580
That's exactly how you should react
when your knee is struck by a hammer.

1:12:16.498 --> 1:12:20.961
Sometimes, doctors just know smart words.
You ever see those guys?

1:12:21.045 --> 1:12:24.590
Like one time I remember I was real tired.
I had this thing, I didn't know what.

1:12:24.673 --> 1:12:27.760
So I went in, and I say, "Hey, Doc,
I got this thing. I'm real tired."

1:12:27.843 --> 1:12:30.554
He goes, "Sounds like
chronic fatigue syndrome to me."

1:12:30.637 --> 1:12:31.930
I say, "Really? What's that?"

1:12:32.014 --> 1:12:34.266
He says, "Well, 'chronic' means 'always,'

1:12:35.017 --> 1:12:38.020
and 'fatigue' means 'tired,'

1:12:38.687 --> 1:12:43.108
and 'syndrome,'
that means 'something you got.'

1:12:44.526 --> 1:12:48.322
Anyway, you can pay Agnes 80 bucks
on the way out."

1:12:52.534 --> 1:12:55.662
I just like a thick-necked,
ignorant-looking man. That's what I like.

1:12:57.247 --> 1:12:59.833
I like a guy that looks like he'd say,
"Follow the money,"

1:12:59.917 --> 1:13:01.835
when he's talking about the vaccine.

1:13:02.378 --> 1:13:07.716
I want One Direction to do
a BTS covers medley at my funeral.

1:13:07.800 --> 1:13:10.094
Because that way, I'll be glad I'm dead.

1:13:12.304 --> 1:13:14.723
I'm looking for a hot young thing.
Somebody about…

1:13:15.516 --> 1:13:16.558
50.

1:13:18.143 --> 1:13:20.145
The best thing about coming out
as transgender

1:13:20.229 --> 1:13:22.272
is that people have been
so thrown off by this

1:13:22.356 --> 1:13:24.233
that they've totally forgotten
to be racist.

1:13:24.316 --> 1:13:27.069
So it's the best thing
that's ever happened. It's great.

1:13:27.152 --> 1:13:29.321
Every single month, I think I'm pregnant.

1:13:29.405 --> 1:13:30.572
Even if I don't have sex,

1:13:30.656 --> 1:13:34.827
I'm like, "Happened to Mary.
It could definitely happen to me."

1:13:34.910 --> 1:13:37.871
People with children will act like
if you don't have children,

1:13:37.955 --> 1:13:40.541
you not allowed to point out
when they're being a shitty parent.

1:13:42.042 --> 1:13:45.879
The weird thing is,
I wasn't trans before I got the vaccine.

1:13:56.932 --> 1:13:59.309
It's like,
"I'm pretty sure I paid for 16."

1:14:01.395 --> 1:14:04.940
Being a comedian is not
a psychiatric condition.

1:14:06.108 --> 1:14:09.528
Are many of us also very fucked up,
myself included?

1:14:09.611 --> 1:14:12.364
Yes. But whatever.

1:14:16.285 --> 1:14:18.954
Periodically, if you're lucky,
you might find lasagna in there.

1:14:20.414 --> 1:14:22.249
-We love you, nigga. Real shit.
-Thank you for the marijuana.

1:14:22.332 --> 1:14:25.252
Yeah, go on. Get down, nigga.
I got one more for you right here.

1:14:25.335 --> 1:14:27.421
-This shit here, that shit there…
-This roll for me?

1:14:27.504 --> 1:14:30.507
This is a Snoop Dogg Netflix production.

1:14:30.591 --> 1:14:32.134
Let's all squeeze together

1:14:32.217 --> 1:14:34.470
'cause I'm sure the regular people
in the front row

1:14:34.553 --> 1:14:35.929
want a picture of the fab four.

1:14:36.013 --> 1:14:38.098
Absolutely not.

1:14:38.182 --> 1:14:39.892
No. Fuck, no. I'm not--

1:14:40.642 --> 1:14:43.979
Recently, comedy has lost Norm Macdonald,

1:14:44.563 --> 1:14:45.647
Louie Anderson,

1:14:45.731 --> 1:14:46.732
Bob Saget,

1:14:47.399 --> 1:14:48.650
Gilbert Gottfried

1:14:48.734 --> 1:14:50.068
and Will Smith.

1:14:57.534 --> 1:14:59.453
Thank you, balcony. I appreciate it.

1:15:00.871 --> 1:15:02.998
I appreciate you coming
and paying half price.

1:15:03.081 --> 1:15:04.750
I thank you very much. It's--

1:15:04.833 --> 1:15:07.085
Thank you, but shut the fuck up.

1:15:07.169 --> 1:15:10.506
No fucking whooping or--
Just laugh. Thank--

1:15:10.589 --> 1:15:13.008
No, but thank--
But shush. Everyone calm down.

1:15:13.091 --> 1:15:14.468
All right, shut the fuck up.

1:15:14.551 --> 1:15:16.887
You letting a bitch know she done made it.

1:15:17.429 --> 1:15:19.973
Where the sexy ladies at?

1:15:21.683 --> 1:15:24.520
Who ain't got no panties on?

1:15:28.065 --> 1:15:30.108
Netflix is letting me know…

1:15:32.027 --> 1:15:34.571
…that my, uh, one-hour special

1:15:35.697 --> 1:15:38.617
has gone over
by 37 minutes and 30 seconds.
