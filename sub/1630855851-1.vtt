WEBVTT

00:24.566 --> 00:27.277
Izzy, wait! I've never repaid you.

00:27.360 --> 00:29.154
Repaid me for what?

00:31.322 --> 00:33.158
For selling us out to the English.

00:38.621 --> 00:40.081
I never made you leave him.

00:41.041 --> 00:42.500
You did that yourself.

00:53.136 --> 00:55.597
Where is he? Where's Ed?

00:59.642 --> 01:03.646
You absolute

01:04.313 --> 01:07.942
twat.

01:11.821 --> 01:14.449
Stede!

01:14.532 --> 01:15.533
Ed!

01:16.868 --> 01:18.703
Stede!

01:19.913 --> 01:21.122
Ed!

01:27.879 --> 01:30.256
Stede!

01:35.762 --> 01:37.263
Stede!

01:42.936 --> 01:44.187
Ed!

01:50.068 --> 01:51.902
Knew you'd find me, babe.

01:52.904 --> 01:54.322
You're not mad?

01:54.948 --> 01:56.658
I knew you'd find me, love.

01:57.408 --> 02:00.745
So, we're good, about everything?

02:01.496 --> 02:02.914
Fuckin' love the beard, mate.

02:03.415 --> 02:04.874
I'm just trying something new.

02:09.628 --> 02:11.172
Bro. Is that you?

02:11.256 --> 02:14.926
No! Oh, God! No!

02:15.010 --> 02:17.095
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

02:20.682 --> 02:23.977
Oh, Christ! Wee John!

02:24.060 --> 02:27.063
-Can you shut it, man?
-He farted on me.

02:27.147 --> 02:28.523
Shut up!

02:28.606 --> 02:30.400
-Shut up, man.
-Enough.

02:30.483 --> 02:32.986
It's still there.
It's a wall of stench.

02:33.069 --> 02:34.696
Can't be worse than you moaning,

02:34.779 --> 02:37.531
"Ed, oh, Ed" all night long.

02:37.615 --> 02:38.825
Shut up.

02:41.036 --> 02:41.911
He's done it again!

02:41.995 --> 02:43.579
Oh, God!

02:43.663 --> 02:44.873
Shut it, man.

02:44.956 --> 02:46.332
You're making more noise
with your shushing

02:46.416 --> 02:49.961
than I am with my complaining
about almost dying from his farts!

02:53.882 --> 02:59.304
"Dear Ed, the crew and I are safe,
and thriving.

03:00.638 --> 03:02.599
"As I've renounced my wealth,

03:02.682 --> 03:04.601
"we've been forced to
take up temporary residence

03:04.684 --> 03:06.811
"on the Republic of Pirates.

03:06.895 --> 03:10.357
Fortunately, we've been able to work
a few of Oluwande's connections."

03:10.440 --> 03:14.611
Basically, the long and short of it is
we're looking for work and

03:16.780 --> 03:18.782
maybe a place to sleep?

03:19.199 --> 03:21.284
Isn't that the dude who broke my nose jar?

03:24.371 --> 03:25.288
Yes. Hi.

03:25.372 --> 03:28.416
-Again, apologies for that.
-Who's Blondie?

03:29.000 --> 03:30.794
-Oh, it's you.
-That's The Swede.

03:30.877 --> 03:32.045
I'm The Swede.

03:33.421 --> 03:34.923
He's single.

03:35.006 --> 03:38.301
Come on over here, baby.
Don't be shy. Come here.

03:38.385 --> 03:39.761
-Go.
-It's okay.

03:39.844 --> 03:40.845
Be brave.

03:41.429 --> 03:42.930
Turn around for me.

03:44.182 --> 03:45.141
Okay.

03:46.976 --> 03:49.853
Aren't you the absolute unit?

03:51.690 --> 03:54.609
You guys can sleep in the cellar.
Start work in 20 minutes.

03:55.485 --> 03:56.361
Yes!

03:56.444 --> 03:57.737
-Okay.
-No, no, no, no, no.

03:57.821 --> 03:59.030
Not you. Not you.

03:59.114 --> 04:00.573
Have a seat.

04:02.951 --> 04:03.993
Okay.

04:04.077 --> 04:06.746
-See ya, mate.
-Thanks, Swede.

04:06.830 --> 04:09.165
Scooch a little closer. Huh?

04:09.249 --> 04:10.709
Spanish Jackie don't bite.

04:11.835 --> 04:14.004
I lied. I bite.

04:18.257 --> 04:21.469
Okay. Time to go.

04:21.970 --> 04:24.389
Good evening.
Welcome to Spanish Jackie's.

04:24.472 --> 04:27.058
-Reservation?
-Eat my fuckin' shit.

04:27.517 --> 04:29.227
Right. Walk-ins, then.

04:31.104 --> 04:33.398
I've got a peach of a table for you.
Follow me.

04:33.481 --> 04:35.650
-My favorite hand!
-He started it.

04:35.734 --> 04:37.694
I told you about the stabbings.

04:37.777 --> 04:42.532
"Guess you could say we're in a bit of
a rebuilding phase as a crew."

04:43.199 --> 04:45.702
-Order up!
-This is for Mom!

04:46.161 --> 04:49.289
Jesus! Nice. Real mature.

04:49.372 --> 04:50.832
"We've really come into our own..."

04:50.915 --> 04:51.875
Here ya go.

04:51.957 --> 04:52.959
"...as a team."

04:53.043 --> 04:54.085
How's that?

04:54.169 --> 04:56.171
-Fuck you.
-Lovely.

04:56.254 --> 04:57.714
Sounding good, Buttons.

04:57.797 --> 05:00.091
May we go back to the sea now,
Captain?

05:00.175 --> 05:03.470
Soon! We still need to save more cash.

05:03.553 --> 05:07.640
"Morale is the highest it's ever been.
It's a golden age."

05:08.350 --> 05:10.852
Hit me with something hard, Olu. Please.

05:10.935 --> 05:12.771
Drinks aren't on the house.
You know that, right?

05:12.854 --> 05:14.647
Come on, please.

05:14.731 --> 05:17.150
I'm happy to buy you a drink.

05:17.901 --> 05:19.277
Well, thank you.

05:19.361 --> 05:21.571
Richard Banes.

05:21.654 --> 05:23.615
My friends, they call me Ricky.

05:23.698 --> 05:26.576
You're Stede Bonnet, aren't you?

05:26.659 --> 05:29.788
I'm afraid I have no idea
what you're saying, or who he is.

05:30.747 --> 05:32.874
I've been called away. Excuse me.

05:32.957 --> 05:35.669
"To reiterate, we're doing great.

05:35.752 --> 05:37.712
"Hope you are as well.

05:39.673 --> 05:42.175
I think of you, often."

05:46.471 --> 05:49.182
We're approachin' the vessel, Captain.

05:49.265 --> 05:51.142
"Hope you're thinking of me

05:51.893 --> 05:53.228
as well."

05:53.311 --> 05:55.814
'Bout fuckin' time we got to that ship.

05:55.897 --> 05:57.148
It's taken forever.

05:58.316 --> 06:01.528
"I know the odds of this
finding you are slim."

06:01.611 --> 06:03.446
I will find you, Ed.

06:06.741 --> 06:10.078
"But so were the odds of us finding
each other in the first place."

06:11.913 --> 06:15.792
The natural condition of
humanity is base and vile.

06:15.875 --> 06:19.045
It is the obligation
of people of standing, such as yourselves,

06:19.129 --> 06:21.256
to elevate the common human rabble

06:21.339 --> 06:24.009
through the sacred
transaction of matrimony.

06:24.801 --> 06:29.305
If anyone objects to this union,
speak now or forever hold your peace.

06:30.015 --> 06:30.890
Objection.

06:34.310 --> 06:36.187
What demon is this?

06:37.480 --> 06:38.481
Demon?

06:40.400 --> 06:41.776
I'm the fuckin' Devil.

06:44.988 --> 06:46.990
And these are the kids.

06:48.867 --> 06:50.243
Guards!

07:46.800 --> 07:50.512
Is it just me or was the wedding thing
a bit over the line?

07:52.347 --> 07:53.973
I don't know.

07:54.057 --> 07:55.850
I've never really been
to a wedding before

07:55.933 --> 07:58.978
so got nothing to compare it to, really.

07:59.562 --> 08:01.648
I've never seen Blackbeard like this.

08:02.107 --> 08:05.151
He didn't even bat a eye
when Ivan got killed.

08:05.235 --> 08:06.820
Cake's bang on though, right?

08:06.903 --> 08:08.905
Fabulous. Very good.

08:09.864 --> 08:11.157
Ya know, in my opinion.

08:11.241 --> 08:14.285
I mean, buttercream isn't
everyone's thing though, is it?

08:14.369 --> 08:17.122
How are you handling all this so well?

08:18.707 --> 08:22.585
Well, see, I have a system for dealing
with all the terrible things I've seen.

08:23.003 --> 08:25.880
There's a box in my mind

08:25.964 --> 08:29.426
and I put the things in the box,
I lock the box.

08:30.218 --> 08:32.220
And then I don't open it again.

08:33.596 --> 08:34.764
Works like a charm.

08:38.434 --> 08:40.145
Dear, oh, dear.

08:40.729 --> 08:42.813
You gonna finish that cake?

08:43.398 --> 08:44.399
No?

08:52.824 --> 08:55.118
They may as well draw horns on his head.

08:55.201 --> 08:56.870
He can't possibly look like this.

08:56.953 --> 08:59.164
He's been busy, though, ain't he?

09:00.415 --> 09:02.500
I've never seen one of these
with writin' on the back.

09:02.584 --> 09:04.002
He's just blowing off some steam.

09:04.085 --> 09:06.796
Susan! Two soups, please.

09:06.880 --> 09:08.089
Hey, Suze.

09:08.673 --> 09:10.800
Look, Captain, you know we're never
gonna save enough

09:10.884 --> 09:12.761
to get the kinda ship you're after.

09:12.844 --> 09:14.929
Well, not with that attitude, we won't.

09:15.013 --> 09:18.933
Sue, if you thought that way,
would you have this wonderful soup kiosk?

09:19.517 --> 09:20.810
Yeah, I probably would.

09:20.894 --> 09:23.396
Sue had tenacity and grit.

09:23.480 --> 09:25.607
I also killed someone
and stole their kiosk.

09:26.191 --> 09:28.777
Sometimes action is better than vision.

09:28.860 --> 09:30.195
See, that's what I've been tellin' him.

09:30.278 --> 09:32.155
That's 'cause you're the smart one.

09:32.864 --> 09:35.784
Well, we can't turn up with any old ship.
We need to look good.

09:36.284 --> 09:39.079
Are you stalling 'cause you think
Blackbeard's gonna murder you?

09:39.162 --> 09:41.039
What? No. Why would he do that?

09:41.122 --> 09:42.582
'Cause he's a fucking madman.

09:42.665 --> 09:44.334
-And you dumped him.
-I didn't dump him.

09:44.417 --> 09:47.671
-You dumped him.
-He dumped you.

09:48.505 --> 09:50.382
No. We're on a break.

09:51.091 --> 09:53.593
A break. Give me a break.

09:53.677 --> 09:57.430
Look, I don't care what any of you say.
He's actually a good guy.

10:02.268 --> 10:05.689
The crew are lookin'
a tad worse for wear.

10:07.357 --> 10:08.274
Did everyone get cake?

10:09.401 --> 10:10.819
Yeah, they got cake.

10:11.736 --> 10:14.906
Well, they're welcome
to have some rhino horn.

10:14.989 --> 10:16.991
Just ground up a fresh batch.

10:19.494 --> 10:20.662
Oh, fuck!

10:21.413 --> 10:23.707
-You want some?
-No, not right now, no.

10:23.790 --> 10:26.042
Well, then get back to work,
ya fuckin' lightweight!

10:26.126 --> 10:29.462
Can't do the job, someone else will.

10:30.255 --> 10:32.424
Right! Get it all up on deck!

10:32.507 --> 10:35.468
So, we gonna divvy this all up
and take our cut then?

10:36.094 --> 10:38.471
No, we're gonna throw it overboard.

10:38.555 --> 10:40.265
We've taken on too much plunder.

10:40.348 --> 10:43.852
We need to dump some to catch up
to our next target.

10:43.935 --> 10:47.647
You want us to throw this treasure away
so we can steal more treasure?

10:47.731 --> 10:50.025
Yeah, that definitely makes no sense, man.

10:50.108 --> 10:55.697
It is not your place to tell me what does
or does not make sense.

10:55.780 --> 10:57.782
It is your job to f--

10:58.825 --> 11:01.161
to follow my fucking orders!

11:04.289 --> 11:06.249
How you doing, Izzy?

11:06.332 --> 11:08.168
I'm fine. Unhand me. Unhand me.

11:08.251 --> 11:10.086
You really don't seem fine.

11:10.170 --> 11:15.550
Yeah, we think you're in an unhealthy
relationship with Blackbeard.

11:15.633 --> 11:18.345
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, that guy does a lot of rhino horn.

11:18.428 --> 11:20.472
Yeah, and he's cut off at least two more
of your toes, hasn't he?

11:20.555 --> 11:24.100
It all seems fairly toxic to me, mate.

11:26.603 --> 11:28.480
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, Izz.

11:28.563 --> 11:29.647
Hey, Izz.

11:29.731 --> 11:31.441
-It's alright.
-Hey, hey, hey, hey.

11:32.817 --> 11:33.860
It's alright. It's alright.

11:35.487 --> 11:37.238
Am I crushing you?

11:37.614 --> 11:39.199
There we are.

11:40.700 --> 11:42.911
It's alright. Alright, there.

11:43.328 --> 11:45.038
Hey, guys.

11:45.121 --> 11:49.250
I don't want to alarm anyone,
but have you seen the jar?

11:49.334 --> 11:51.127
-Our savings jar?
-Yeah.

11:51.211 --> 11:52.128
No.

11:53.004 --> 11:55.006
This jar right here?

11:57.258 --> 11:59.302
I see y'all been holdin' out on me.

11:59.386 --> 12:01.888
Jackie, that is our money.
We earned it.

12:02.806 --> 12:05.308
You know, I had y'all on the broke
motherfucker plan.

12:05.392 --> 12:08.520
I think I'm gonna upgrade you
to the triflin' ingrate plan.

12:08.603 --> 12:11.314
-There's a lot of fees.
-A whole lot of fees.

12:11.398 --> 12:12.691
Room and board.

12:13.942 --> 12:16.069
And I do believe they
have the Vista Suite.

12:16.152 --> 12:18.363
-Vista Suite?
-The room with the window.

12:20.365 --> 12:21.700
Semi-clean water.

12:21.783 --> 12:23.368
Come on.

12:24.160 --> 12:26.329
Can you think of anything else,
boo cakes?

12:26.788 --> 12:29.499
Ongoing job training and education?

12:29.582 --> 12:31.376
-Absolutely.
-Come on!

12:31.459 --> 12:32.627
Swede!

12:32.711 --> 12:34.587
Look like you owe me.

12:34.671 --> 12:38.508
Oh, yeah? Well, what if we took that back?

12:40.593 --> 12:42.804
I think my husbands
would have a problem with that.

12:45.181 --> 12:47.392
Have ya met all 20 of 'em?

12:50.270 --> 12:51.688
That's a lotta husbands.

12:52.522 --> 12:55.108
I know that guy.
We had breakfast together.

12:55.191 --> 12:57.694
You will be havin' a lot of breakfasts-es
together.

12:57.777 --> 12:59.112
Oh, okay.

13:00.447 --> 13:03.158
You know,
a change of scenery could be good.

13:03.241 --> 13:04.743
We were stagnating there anyway.

13:04.826 --> 13:07.287
So, you're suggesting
that we live under a bridge?

13:07.370 --> 13:08.997
How am I supposed to cook here?

13:10.040 --> 13:13.168
At least we got a roof. Lots of air.

13:14.836 --> 13:15.712
Oh, shit.

13:15.795 --> 13:18.298
Oh, look. Running water.

13:19.507 --> 13:22.260
Dear Ed, things are terrible.

13:23.303 --> 13:25.013
I think I'm afraid to see you.

13:25.513 --> 13:27.557
I'm not afraid you're gonna kill me.

13:27.640 --> 13:31.811
I'm afraid that your life
is better without me.

13:35.148 --> 13:38.151
Could be. Could be, mate.

13:38.735 --> 13:41.279
I know who you are.

13:41.363 --> 13:44.824
Jesus! Can't you give a man some privacy?

13:45.575 --> 13:49.621
Please forgive me,
but I know everything about you.

13:49.704 --> 13:51.706
All of your adventures.

13:51.790 --> 13:54.793
-I'm sorry if that's a little bit creepy.
-You are creepy.

13:54.876 --> 13:58.004
And whatever you're selling,
I don't wanna buy it.

13:59.047 --> 14:01.383
But the Gentleman Pirate,
he saved my life!

14:02.258 --> 14:06.262
Quite frankly, you're my hero.

14:10.350 --> 14:13.603
See, I, too, am a child of wealth.

14:14.354 --> 14:17.607
I'm actually a minor prince.

14:17.691 --> 14:21.236
And I was entertaining ending it all
when I heard about you.

14:22.237 --> 14:25.907
You gave an odd bird like me hope, Bonnet.

14:25.990 --> 14:30.286
And I could have a life
of my own invention.

14:32.580 --> 14:34.582
Okay, come on. Get out of the rain.

14:37.460 --> 14:40.213
Look, the Republic of Pirates
isn't a game.

14:40.797 --> 14:43.842
You'd do well to steer clear of this place
before ya get hurt.

14:43.925 --> 14:45.844
Especially Spanish Jackie's.

14:45.927 --> 14:48.013
No, I've been barred from there.

14:48.096 --> 14:50.223
Yeah, I was too nosy.

14:50.890 --> 14:55.228
I made a little remark
about her Roman puzzle chest.

14:56.021 --> 14:57.814
What? A Roman puzzle chest?

14:57.897 --> 15:00.191
Yes. She had it brought
through the bar.

15:00.275 --> 15:02.944
And these rubes,
they don't know what one is,

15:03.028 --> 15:07.198
but men of our standing,
we know a valuable when we see one.

15:08.533 --> 15:10.160
Roman puzzle chest.

15:11.202 --> 15:15.290
Okay. Jackie keeps the trunk
at the foot of her bed.

15:15.373 --> 15:20.503
I don't even know what's inside
but she says it's of great value.

15:20.587 --> 15:22.505
How do we know we can trust you?

15:22.589 --> 15:24.549
You're husband number 20, after all.

15:24.632 --> 15:26.217
-Come on, man. He's The Swede.
-Come on.

15:26.301 --> 15:28.928
-Black Pete, come on.
-My time with Jackie

15:29.012 --> 15:32.015
has been the happiest of my life.

15:32.098 --> 15:36.311
Her love has helped me locate parts
of myself I didn't even know existed

15:36.394 --> 15:40.690
and reclaim others that I had long missed.

15:41.733 --> 15:42.776
But

15:44.361 --> 15:49.157
I owe you a life debt
and I am bound to honor it.

15:49.949 --> 15:51.201
-That's a friend.
-Life debt.

15:51.284 --> 15:52.452
Hear, hear.

15:52.535 --> 15:53.745
-Yep, yep.
-True.

15:55.288 --> 15:58.667
You're a good man, Swede.
Thanks for this.

15:59.209 --> 16:01.086
Would tonight work?

16:01.169 --> 16:02.629
Yes, indeed.

16:02.712 --> 16:06.675
Tonight is my turn to perform
the husbandly duties.

16:06.758 --> 16:09.177
-So...
-Okay.

16:10.595 --> 16:13.181
The crew are refusing
to part with any treasure.

16:13.264 --> 16:14.557
Why?

16:14.641 --> 16:16.851
Because it's fuckin' treasure.

16:17.894 --> 16:19.521
Not good enough.

16:21.731 --> 16:23.358
And that's another toe.

16:26.069 --> 16:27.696
Take your boot off.

16:30.865 --> 16:32.951
Who am I to you?

16:33.910 --> 16:35.120
What?

16:35.745 --> 16:38.373
We've worked together for years.

16:38.456 --> 16:40.250
You know me better than anyone
has ever known me

16:40.333 --> 16:43.336
and I daresay the same is true
for me about you.

16:45.171 --> 16:46.589
I have

16:48.425 --> 16:50.677
-love for you, Edward.
-Oh, come on.

16:50.760 --> 16:53.388
I'm worried about you.
We all are.

16:53.471 --> 16:57.100
The atmosphere on this ship
is completely poisoned.

16:58.309 --> 17:01.521
But if we could all just maybe

17:04.232 --> 17:05.400
talk it through.

17:08.819 --> 17:10.238
As a crew?

17:14.034 --> 17:16.327
Hang on. Ed! Captain!

17:16.411 --> 17:18.579
At no point did I want to channel

17:18.663 --> 17:20.915
-the former owner of this vessel.
-Hi, all.

17:22.208 --> 17:26.755
Real quick, I heard that you think
the vibe here on the ship is poisonous.

17:30.383 --> 17:32.552
Care to elaborate? Anyone?

17:32.635 --> 17:34.721
Jim, we'll start with you.

17:35.055 --> 17:36.931
Is the vibe here poisonous?

17:37.015 --> 17:39.225
-Nope.
-You?

17:39.309 --> 17:41.561
Me? No. No.

17:42.312 --> 17:45.690
Fang, you've been here the longest.
Poisoned?

17:45.774 --> 17:47.192
No, I'm alright.

17:47.275 --> 17:50.362
I know who we should ask,
ol' Blackbeard.

17:50.445 --> 17:53.323
Hello, mate. You think the vibe
on the ship is poisoned?

17:53.823 --> 17:55.116
I don't know, Blackbeard.

17:55.200 --> 17:58.620
Maybe a little bit toxic sometimes.
Maybe it's a bit uncomfortable.

17:58.703 --> 18:00.914
You do make the crew a little bit
uncomfortable sometimes.

18:00.997 --> 18:03.750
They think you're crazy.
Well, I'm not crazy. I don't feel crazy.

18:03.833 --> 18:07.462
-I feel pretty fucking good actually.
-Fucking end!

18:14.260 --> 18:18.264
The atmosphere on this ship is fucked.

18:19.474 --> 18:21.101
Everyone knows why.

18:23.103 --> 18:26.106
Well, I don't. Enlighten me.

18:28.108 --> 18:29.859
Your feelings for Stede fuckin' Bonnet.

18:33.947 --> 18:35.490
-Frenchie.
-Yes?

18:36.116 --> 18:38.076
Congratulations, you are now first mate.

18:38.159 --> 18:40.912
Oh, no. I don't think I'm qualified.

18:40.995 --> 18:43.832
'Course you are, mate.
You can start by cleaning up that mess.

18:43.915 --> 18:47.460
And the rest of you, you throw this shit
overboard and get suited up.

18:48.294 --> 18:49.879
We got a record to break.

18:56.720 --> 18:58.388
Oh, my God.

18:58.471 --> 19:01.391
Your back is really tight.

19:01.933 --> 19:04.769
Like, super tight.

19:05.854 --> 19:09.065
It's so good. Don't stop.

19:09.149 --> 19:10.525
-Okay.
-More.

19:10.608 --> 19:12.652
Maybe I'll get started on the hamstrings?

19:12.736 --> 19:14.612
Yes. Fuck those hammies up.

19:14.696 --> 19:17.407
-Okay.
-Fuck those hammies up.

19:18.825 --> 19:22.078
How are you so good at this?

19:29.502 --> 19:30.712
Come on.

19:31.755 --> 19:32.922
Olu's meeting us at the docks.

19:33.006 --> 19:35.091
I can't believe how well this is going.

19:35.175 --> 19:37.052
Stede, what on Earth's takin' so long?

19:37.135 --> 19:39.346
Rick!
You're supposed to be on lookout duty.

19:39.429 --> 19:42.390
Lookout?
No, this is where the action is.

19:43.725 --> 19:44.684
What are you doing?

19:45.268 --> 19:47.437
I am leaving my calling card.

19:48.104 --> 19:51.232
Yes, it is called a Lime Ricky.

19:52.025 --> 19:56.404
It's bit of an ornate aperitif,
but absolutely undeniable.

19:56.905 --> 19:58.907
You're insane. We've gotta get going.

19:58.990 --> 20:01.868
You see, this is where you went wrong
with the whole Gentleman Pirate thing.

20:02.577 --> 20:06.831
Details like this are important
to build a brand.

20:06.915 --> 20:08.249
So when people see this,

20:08.333 --> 20:11.294
they know that they
have been robbed by the best.

20:11.378 --> 20:12.712
You've been Rick'd.

20:12.796 --> 20:16.966
The calf muscle is the most mysterious
of all the muscles--

20:17.634 --> 20:18.677
Babe, shut the fuck up.

20:19.427 --> 20:20.804
Somebody fuckin' with the bar.

20:20.887 --> 20:21.846
-What?
-Get up.

20:21.930 --> 20:22.889
-Now?
-Get up! Yes!

20:22.972 --> 20:23.890
I'll get the knife.

20:25.558 --> 20:26.559
Who are you?

20:27.477 --> 20:29.270
You? You robbed me?

20:29.354 --> 20:31.022
-Swede, knife.
-Wait, wait!

20:31.106 --> 20:33.066
Do you know who I am? I'm a minor prince!

20:33.775 --> 20:36.903
I guess I'm gon' get a fancy-ass
nose for my jar.

20:40.281 --> 20:41.825
Okay. Where's the getaway dory?

20:41.908 --> 20:43.493
Buttons went to get it.

20:43.576 --> 20:45.995
Right. Why is your face blue?

20:46.079 --> 20:48.832
This is what we risked our lives for.

20:48.915 --> 20:50.333
Blue dirt!

20:52.252 --> 20:53.753
No, this is indigo.

20:53.837 --> 20:56.339
It's the finest dye. It's worth a fortune.

20:56.423 --> 21:00.510
That's right.
Now give me back my blue shit, Steve.

21:02.429 --> 21:06.975
I can't believe you guys robbed Jackie.

21:07.892 --> 21:09.769
So bad.

21:09.853 --> 21:11.771
Jackie, this is not what it looks like.

21:11.855 --> 21:13.857
Depending on what you think
it looks like.

21:14.232 --> 21:16.609
It looks like more noses for my jar.

21:16.693 --> 21:19.279
-No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
-Wait!

21:25.076 --> 21:27.037
-Susan?
-What?

21:27.454 --> 21:29.372
I'll buy it from you.

21:29.456 --> 21:31.458
Ain't you that soup bitch?

21:32.792 --> 21:35.003
I'm the money bitch.

21:38.840 --> 21:40.216
That enough?

21:41.426 --> 21:44.137
Nah, soup bitch. It actually is not.

21:44.220 --> 21:45.597
How 'bout double?

21:48.183 --> 21:50.352
I want this lot as well.

21:52.896 --> 21:54.022
Alright.

21:54.689 --> 21:55.982
Sold.

21:56.983 --> 22:00.445
-Get these assholes up outta here.
-Hey!

22:00.528 --> 22:03.073
-Yeah, let's get outta--
-Nah, nah, nah.

22:03.365 --> 22:06.034
-Come back here.
-Okay.

22:06.451 --> 22:08.661
Did you double-cross me?

22:10.163 --> 22:12.791
I owed a life debt.

22:13.708 --> 22:17.545
It's okay, sexy Dutchman.
Double-cross is my jam.

22:17.629 --> 22:21.257
-So you're not mad?
-No. It's kinda hot.

22:21.800 --> 22:23.051
Okay.

22:23.134 --> 22:24.761
-We work it out at the house.
-Okay.

22:26.513 --> 22:27.555
Let's go, husbands.

22:28.723 --> 22:31.643
Can't believe you paid that much
for some blue dirt, Susan.

22:31.726 --> 22:36.481
Please. This much indigo is worth
three times what I paid.

22:36.564 --> 22:40.819
One thing I've learned in my time here,
you people know so little.

22:41.403 --> 22:43.988
-Who are you?
-Alright, come on. Let's move.

22:44.072 --> 22:46.241
You work for her now. Let's go. Let's go!

22:46.324 --> 22:47.283
Okay.

22:51.955 --> 22:53.289
Hurry up.

23:06.636 --> 23:08.430
Stop crying.

23:08.513 --> 23:12.517
I can't stop crying. He shot Izzy.

23:13.143 --> 23:15.520
Wanna hear the story of the wooden boy?

23:17.397 --> 23:20.859
So, there once was this boy, and-- Wait.

23:21.609 --> 23:24.112
Was it a puppet first?
Yeah, it was a puppet first.

23:24.195 --> 23:26.614
And they wanted to be real,
like a human or whatever,

23:26.698 --> 23:29.492
so they wished on a monkey's paw to--

23:30.243 --> 23:32.120
Do the voice.

23:37.542 --> 23:40.920
Man, oh, man,
do I wish I were a real person.

23:45.342 --> 23:47.135
Do some more.

23:49.679 --> 23:52.640
The monkey paw, it glows!

23:52.724 --> 23:54.392
That's good.

24:00.774 --> 24:01.649
Right.

24:04.069 --> 24:05.236
So what's the plan, Captain?

24:05.320 --> 24:08.782
Figured as first mate,
I should be doin' somethin'.

24:10.700 --> 24:13.328
You know there's a bird
that never touches ground?

24:15.372 --> 24:19.000
It's born in the air. Never once lands.

24:20.960 --> 24:23.963
Spends its entire existence in the sky.

24:28.551 --> 24:32.972
Sounds like something that maybe
actually can't exist, Captain.

24:33.932 --> 24:35.934
Never going back to land.

24:42.065 --> 24:45.777
We're gonna sail, rob,

24:45.860 --> 24:51.700
raise hell forever, and ever without end.

24:56.871 --> 24:58.498
Sounds like a plan.

24:59.916 --> 25:01.501
Dismissed.

25:24.733 --> 25:27.360
Fuck you, Stede Bonnet.

25:38.955 --> 25:40.957
Goodnight, Ed Teach.

25:42.542 --> 25:46.504
We are return, my love. My ocean deep.

25:46.588 --> 25:49.007
Never more shall we be parted.

25:49.090 --> 25:52.969
So, are we in soup now or?

25:53.053 --> 25:56.181
I'm totally down for that. I love soup.

25:56.264 --> 25:57.474
Same.

25:58.224 --> 26:01.227
So you're not actually a soup seller,
are you?

26:02.562 --> 26:03.980
Not exactly.

26:04.522 --> 26:05.607
So who are you then?

26:06.775 --> 26:09.486
Avert your eyes.

26:09.569 --> 26:14.741
You are in the presence of Zheng Yi Sao,
Pirate Queen!

27:30.025 --> 27:34.612
So then, the monkey's paw started glowing.

27:34.696 --> 27:37.866
"I pray to you, Dark Lord,

27:37.949 --> 27:41.786
"to make me real flesh.

27:41.870 --> 27:43.580
I want to be real flesh!"

27:43.663 --> 27:45.498
And then, the monkey paw goes,

27:45.582 --> 27:51.504
"I will make you
the fleshy boy you desire."

27:51.588 --> 27:56.092
"Oh, wow! I'm starting to turn into flesh!

27:56.176 --> 27:57.927
It feels so soft!"
