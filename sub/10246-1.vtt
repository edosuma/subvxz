02:34.571 --> 02:37.323
January 11th at 2:30 p. m....

02:38.033 --> 02:41.035
You'll do your statement separately.
This one's ours.

02:41.203 --> 02:44.705
...following a verbal dispute
in Brooklyn Bridge Park...

02:44.873 --> 02:49.460
...Zachary Cowan, age 11,
and armed with a stick...

02:49.628 --> 02:53.798
...struck our son, Ethan Longstreet,
in the face.

02:54.883 --> 02:58.427
Ln addition to the swelling and bruising
of Ethan's upper lip...

02:58.595 --> 03:02.557
...this act also resulted in
two broken incisors...

03:02.724 --> 03:06.686
...including nerve damage
to the right incisor.

03:06.854 --> 03:08.437
"Armed"?

03:09.356 --> 03:11.774
Armed. What...?
You don't like "armed"?

03:11.942 --> 03:14.610
Michael, what could we say?
"Carrying"? "Holding"?

03:14.778 --> 03:16.904
- Carrying a stick? All right?
- Carrying, yeah.

03:17.072 --> 03:19.240
- Carrying a stick.
- Carrying.

03:21.493 --> 03:22.910
It's ironic.

03:23.078 --> 03:26.664
I always thought Brooklyn Bridge Park
was so safe compared to Hillside.

03:26.832 --> 03:29.125
True. We always said,
"Brooklyn Bridge Park, fine.

03:29.293 --> 03:31.252
Hillside, no way."

03:31.920 --> 03:34.630
- It just goes to show you.
- Thank you.

03:34.798 --> 03:36.757
Hey, thank you so much for coming.

03:36.925 --> 03:42.221
It's so much better than getting
caught up in that adversarial mind-set.

03:42.389 --> 03:44.557
Well, we thank you. Really.

03:44.725 --> 03:47.476
I don't think there's any reason
for us to thank each other.

03:47.644 --> 03:50.855
Luckily, some of us still have
a sense of community. Right?

03:51.023 --> 03:53.441
Though the kids haven't got
that notion straight yet.

03:53.609 --> 03:56.110
- Right.
- I mean our kid.

03:56.278 --> 03:58.988
Right, our kid.

04:02.701 --> 04:04.577
Thank you.

04:04.786 --> 04:06.621
Those tulips are gorgeous.

04:06.788 --> 04:10.207
Oh, it's the florist up by Henry.
You know the one? All the way up.

04:10.375 --> 04:11.459
Oh, right.

04:11.627 --> 04:13.794
Yeah. They fly the bulbs
right in from Holland.

04:13.962 --> 04:16.672
- Twenty dollars for a whole bunch.
- Ls that a fact?

04:16.839 --> 04:18.966
Yeah. Do you know it?
All the way up.

04:19.134 --> 04:21.177
Right. Right.

04:21.345 --> 04:25.181
Well.... So, what about the tooth
with the damaged nerve?

04:25.349 --> 04:27.391
Well, we don't know yet.

04:27.559 --> 04:31.062
There's some question
about the prognosis. Apparently....

04:31.229 --> 04:34.023
Well, apparently the nerve
is not completely exposed.

04:34.191 --> 04:37.026
- Only part of it is exposed.
- There's a part that's exposed...

04:37.194 --> 04:39.528
...and then there's a part
that's still protected.

04:39.696 --> 04:41.572
For now,
they're not gonna devitalize it.

04:41.740 --> 04:43.407
They wanna give the tooth
a chance.

04:43.575 --> 04:45.493
Yeah. We'd so love
to avoid a root canal.

04:45.744 --> 04:46.786
Oh, of course.

04:46.954 --> 04:50.331
There's an observation period while
they give the nerve a chance to heal.

04:50.540 --> 04:51.666
He's gonna need caps.

04:51.833 --> 04:54.210
- You can't have implants till you're 18.
- You can't.

04:54.378 --> 04:57.380
Yeah, so.... They can only do implants
once they're done growing.

04:57.547 --> 04:58.714
Naturally.

04:58.882 --> 05:01.968
Well, we hope
it all turns out all right.

05:02.135 --> 05:03.928
One can only hope.

05:04.096 --> 05:05.763
Listen....

05:06.515 --> 05:09.308
He didn't wanna tell on Zachary.

05:09.476 --> 05:11.227
No, he didn't wanna tell.

05:11.395 --> 05:17.942
It was incredible to see this child
with no face left, no teeth.

05:18.276 --> 05:21.278
- He just wouldn't talk.
- I can just imagine.

05:21.446 --> 05:24.782
He didn't wanna tell on the kid.
His friends would say he's a snitch.

05:24.950 --> 05:27.451
Let's face it, Penny,
it wasn't just a sense of honor.

05:27.619 --> 05:30.621
Well, you could say that.
Honor requires a social context.

05:30.789 --> 05:33.791
So how did you finally get
Zachary's name?

05:34.167 --> 05:36.210
Well, because
we explained to Ethan...

05:36.378 --> 05:39.130
...that protecting this child
was not gonna help him.

05:39.297 --> 05:43.009
We told him if this kid thinks he can get
away with hitting, why should he stop?

05:43.176 --> 05:46.429
We told him if we were this child's
parents, we would wanna know.

05:46.596 --> 05:49.849
- Of course.
- Yeah. Excuse me one second.

05:50.017 --> 05:51.100
- Yes, Walter.
- Alan.

05:51.268 --> 05:53.602
Well, thanks for getting back to me.

05:53.770 --> 05:57.189
It's in this morning's Journal.
I'll read it to you.

05:57.357 --> 06:00.443
"According to a study published
by British journal Lancet..."

06:00.610 --> 06:04.530
...two Australian researchers have
identified neurological side effects...

06:04.698 --> 06:07.742
...of TW Pharma's
anti-hypertension medication Antril...

06:07.909 --> 06:10.661
"...including impaired hearing
and ataxia."

06:10.829 --> 06:12.538
How come nobody
told me about this?

06:12.706 --> 06:14.749
Who does your press monitoring
over there?

06:14.916 --> 06:17.251
- This is gonna mean trouble.
- You're in deep shit.

06:17.419 --> 06:19.503
What do we do?
Do we move on this right away?

06:19.671 --> 06:21.505
No, no. My problem is the ASM.

06:21.673 --> 06:24.341
You got an annual stockholders'
meeting in two weeks.

06:24.509 --> 06:26.677
Did you schedule a contingency
for litigation?

06:26.845 --> 06:28.971
I'm not sure. I have to check.

06:29.139 --> 06:30.890
- Walter. Walter.
- Yeah?

06:31.058 --> 06:34.393
Talk to PR. Find out if it was picked up
anywhere else and call me back.

06:34.561 --> 06:36.562
- Right.
- Okay.

06:37.230 --> 06:39.565
- Sorry.
- So you're, like, a....

06:39.733 --> 06:41.275
An attorney.

06:41.443 --> 06:44.278
- And yourself?
- Housewares supply.

06:44.446 --> 06:46.864
Penny's a writer.
She works part-time in a bookstore.

06:47.032 --> 06:49.742
- Mostly art books and history books.
- A writer?

06:49.910 --> 06:53.412
Well, I cowrote a volume
on Sabaean civilization...

06:53.580 --> 06:55.748
...working with artifacts
that were retrieved...

06:55.916 --> 06:57.917
...after the Ethiopia-Eritrea conflict.

06:58.085 --> 07:01.504
But right now I'm working on
a book about the Darfur tragedy.

07:01.671 --> 07:03.672
Do you specialize in Africa?

07:03.840 --> 07:06.258
I'm interested
in that part of the world, yes.

07:06.426 --> 07:08.260
And do you have
any other children?

07:08.428 --> 07:09.845
There's Courtney. She's 9.

07:10.013 --> 07:12.306
She's very angry
with her father right now...

07:12.474 --> 07:15.351
...because he got rid of the hamster
last night.

07:16.436 --> 07:19.396
- You got rid of the hamster?
- Yeah.

07:19.564 --> 07:21.565
The thing was making
such a racket at night.

07:21.733 --> 07:25.194
They sleep during the day.
It was driving Ethan crazy, so...

07:25.362 --> 07:29.115
You know, he couldn't take the racket
that thing was making. Yeah.

07:29.282 --> 07:31.534
I don't mind telling you,
I've been wanting to...

07:31.701 --> 07:33.744
...get rid of the thing
for the longest time.

07:33.912 --> 07:36.872
Finally I said, "That's it!"
Took it out, left it on the street.

07:37.040 --> 07:38.290
You left it on the street?

07:38.458 --> 07:40.334
I figured it was
a gutter-sewer animal...

07:40.502 --> 07:43.712
...but the thing was scared out
of its wits out there on the sidewalk.

07:43.880 --> 07:45.673
They're not pets
and they're not wild.

07:45.841 --> 07:47.925
You drop them in the forest,
still not happy.

07:48.093 --> 07:50.302
I don't know where
you're supposed to put them.

07:50.470 --> 07:52.179
So you just left him outside?

07:52.347 --> 07:53.806
Yeah, he did.

07:53.974 --> 07:56.684
He tried to convince Courtney
that the hamster ran away...

07:56.852 --> 07:58.686
...which of course,
she was not buying.

07:58.854 --> 08:00.729
And this morning
the hamster was gone?

08:00.897 --> 08:02.314
Gone.

08:02.482 --> 08:04.859
What about you?
What do you do for a living?

08:05.610 --> 08:07.319
Oh, I'm an investment broker.

08:10.407 --> 08:13.993
Let me...
I'm just gonna ask this directly.

08:14.244 --> 08:16.829
Could Zachary apologize to Ethan?

08:17.455 --> 08:19.915
Sure. It would be good
if they talked.

08:20.083 --> 08:22.042
No, he's got to apologize, Alan.

08:22.210 --> 08:24.211
He has to actually say he's sorry.

08:24.379 --> 08:26.172
- Yeah, probably.
- Well, is he sorry?

08:26.339 --> 08:28.132
He doesn't realize
how serious it was.

08:28.466 --> 08:30.259
He's 11 years old.

08:30.427 --> 08:32.094
Well, 11's not a baby.

08:32.261 --> 08:34.096
Well, it's not an adult either.

08:34.264 --> 08:36.849
We forgot to ask you guys,
you want some coffee or tea?

08:37.017 --> 08:40.727
Ls there any of that cobbler left,
Penny? She makes a mean cobbler.

08:41.145 --> 08:42.813
- You got espresso?
- We do.

08:42.981 --> 08:45.649
- I wouldn't mind a cup.
- Glass of water.

08:45.817 --> 08:49.320
Yeah. I'll take an espresso too, babe.
And bring the cobbler. Come on in.

08:54.367 --> 08:57.119
Please. Please, have a seat.
Have a seat.

08:57.287 --> 09:00.247
I didn't mean to rush you out.
Here. Here.

09:00.916 --> 09:02.041
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

09:02.209 --> 09:04.543
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

09:10.300 --> 09:12.676
You gotta taste this cobbler.

09:13.678 --> 09:15.137
Where's the cobbler?

09:21.853 --> 09:23.687
She put the cobbler
in the fridge again.

09:23.855 --> 09:26.899
I don't know what language I'm
supposed to speak to that woman in.

09:28.068 --> 09:30.069
Nice couple.

09:30.237 --> 09:31.904
Very.

09:32.697 --> 09:34.448
They're nice, right?

09:34.991 --> 09:36.659
Do you tell everybody I'm a writer?

09:36.826 --> 09:38.994
You are a writer. You wrote a book.

09:42.624 --> 09:45.542
Good cobbler is not easy to make.

09:47.879 --> 09:49.255
What do you sell?

09:49.422 --> 09:53.926
Decorative hardware. Door locks,
handles, copper fittings and...

09:54.094 --> 09:55.302
That's... Thank you.

09:55.470 --> 09:58.931
And kitchen equipment.
Pots and pans. Yeah.

09:59.224 --> 10:00.724
Ls that a good living?

10:00.892 --> 10:04.186
You know, it's not like we had
any banner years or anything.

10:04.354 --> 10:05.813
It was tough starting out.

10:05.981 --> 10:08.816
As long as I'm out there
every morning with my sample case...

10:08.984 --> 10:10.526
...and my catalog, it's a living.

10:10.694 --> 10:14.571
Although the cast-iron roasting pans
do pick up around the holidays.

10:14.739 --> 10:15.864
Yeah.

10:16.032 --> 10:18.617
When you saw that a hamster
was terrified...

10:18.785 --> 10:20.452
...why didn't you bring it home?

10:20.620 --> 10:22.913
Because I don't touch those things.

10:23.081 --> 10:24.957
You put it on the sidewalk.

10:25.125 --> 10:27.251
It was in a cage,
so I flipped it on its side.

10:27.419 --> 10:29.420
There's no way
I'm touching those things.

10:29.587 --> 10:31.505
- Sugar?
- No sugar.

10:32.173 --> 10:33.882
What kind of cobbler
did you make?

10:34.050 --> 10:35.801
Apple and pear.

10:35.969 --> 10:37.386
Apple and pear?

10:37.554 --> 10:40.681
Yeah. It's, you know...
It's a little recipe of mine.

10:40.849 --> 10:42.891
But it's a shame it's cold.

10:43.059 --> 10:46.186
Apple and pear. That's new to me.

10:46.354 --> 10:49.732
Apple and pear is a classic.
Of course, there's a twist to it.

10:49.899 --> 10:50.941
Oh, really?

10:51.109 --> 10:54.570
You have to cut the pears thicker than
the apples because they cook faster.

10:55.030 --> 10:56.196
Oh, right.

10:56.364 --> 10:59.199
- She's not telling you the real secret.
- Let them taste it.

10:59.826 --> 11:02.119
Very good. Very good.

11:02.787 --> 11:05.372
- Delicious.
- Gingerbread crumbs.

11:05.540 --> 11:07.291
Oh, my God.

11:07.459 --> 11:10.336
Well, it's really just a souped-up
old-school recipe.

11:10.503 --> 11:11.837
His mother gave me the idea.

11:12.005 --> 11:15.257
Gingerbread. Fantastic.

11:16.176 --> 11:18.677
At least we get a new recipe
out of this, right?

11:19.554 --> 11:22.514
I wish my son didn't have to
lose two teeth in the process.

11:22.682 --> 11:24.099
Right. That's what I meant.

11:24.267 --> 11:25.976
You have a novel way
of expressing it.

11:26.144 --> 11:28.771
No, hey, I... Excuse me.

11:29.606 --> 11:31.440
Yeah, Walter.

11:33.485 --> 11:36.737
No. No, no. No letters to the editor.

11:38.531 --> 11:41.116
You'll just fan the flames.

11:42.535 --> 11:44.828
- Well, was it scheduled?
- No.

11:44.996 --> 11:46.538
We decided to let it go.

11:46.706 --> 11:49.541
What are these disorders anyway?
What is ataxia?

11:49.709 --> 11:53.212
It's lack of balance
and unsteady or jerky gait.

11:53.380 --> 11:56.715
- ln normal doses?
- Ln normal doses, rarely.

11:56.883 --> 11:59.843
- How long have you known this?
- Two years, two and a half years.

12:00.011 --> 12:02.137
And in all that time,
you haven't recalled it?

12:02.305 --> 12:03.472
You're joking, right?

12:03.640 --> 12:06.100
What are we talking about
in revenues?

12:07.435 --> 12:09.520
Oh, I see.

12:11.022 --> 12:12.689
Okay.

12:14.859 --> 12:17.444
Al. We're all waiting for you.

12:17.612 --> 12:20.656
Yeah, right. One second.

12:21.032 --> 12:23.742
- Dennis?
- Did you talk to him?

12:23.910 --> 12:26.412
They've known about the risks
for two and a half years.

12:26.579 --> 12:28.705
- Jesus!
- Yeah.

12:29.624 --> 12:31.250
An internal report.

12:31.418 --> 12:35.504
But the undesirable side effects
are not established.

12:35.672 --> 12:37.756
No precautionary measures.

12:37.924 --> 12:40.759
They didn't schedule a reserve.
Nothing in the annual report.

12:40.927 --> 12:43.554
I can't believe it.
What are the symptoms?

12:43.721 --> 12:46.640
Lack of balance, jerky gait.
The works.

12:46.808 --> 12:49.518
Basically, you look like you're drunk.

12:52.981 --> 12:56.567
Roughly half a billion in revenues.

12:57.777 --> 13:00.654
- You there?
- Yeah. What'd you advise him to do?

13:00.822 --> 13:03.282
- Well, deny.
- Of course.

13:03.450 --> 13:06.201
That dumb shit wanted us
to write a letter to the editor.

13:06.369 --> 13:07.744
No way we're writing a letter.

13:08.371 --> 13:11.373
On the other hand,
if we see this is getting picked up...

13:11.541 --> 13:13.417
...we could do a press release...

13:13.585 --> 13:16.128
...like "somebody's spreading
false rumors two weeks..."

13:16.296 --> 13:17.754
"...from the ASM" kind of thing.

13:17.922 --> 13:20.424
- Want me to broach it with him?
- No, he's calling back.

13:20.592 --> 13:22.634
We'll talk and then work
on a press release.

13:22.802 --> 13:24.136
Okay.

13:27.056 --> 13:29.266
I've been so busy,
I hardly had time for lunch.

13:29.434 --> 13:32.853
Help yourself. Help yourself. Here.

13:34.147 --> 13:35.439
- Here.
- Thanks.

13:35.607 --> 13:38.275
No, no. Go on. Go on.

13:38.776 --> 13:40.903
I know I have no manners.

13:41.070 --> 13:42.446
Where were we?

13:42.614 --> 13:44.907
We were saying it would
have been so much nicer...

13:45.074 --> 13:47.075
...if we'd met some other way.

13:47.243 --> 13:48.285
This cobbler, right.

13:48.453 --> 13:50.037
- So your mother, huh?
- His mother.

13:50.205 --> 13:52.247
It's my mother's recipe.
Pen made it.

13:52.415 --> 13:54.833
Your mother doesn't use
apples and pears.

13:55.001 --> 13:56.126
No.

13:56.294 --> 13:58.587
She's about to have an operation.
Poor thing.

13:58.755 --> 14:00.797
- Oh, really? What for?
- Her knee.

14:00.965 --> 14:04.843
She's gonna get a
polyethylene and metallic prosthesis.

14:05.011 --> 14:08.805
And she's all worried about what's
gonna be left of it after the cremation.

14:08.973 --> 14:10.599
Michael, don't be mean.

14:10.767 --> 14:12.935
She doesn't wanna be buried
next to my father.

14:13.102 --> 14:15.103
She wants to be cremated
and put upstate...

14:15.271 --> 14:17.231
...next to her mother who's all alone.

14:17.398 --> 14:21.360
Couple of urns jabbering away
on the shores of Lake Sebago.

14:25.031 --> 14:28.450
We're very touched
by how generous you're being.

14:28.618 --> 14:31.286
We realize how you're trying
to smooth things out here...

14:31.454 --> 14:33.789
...instead of making them worse.

14:33.957 --> 14:35.666
Please. It's the least we can do.

14:35.833 --> 14:37.376
Yeah.

14:37.544 --> 14:41.964
No, come on. I mean, so many parents
just take their kid's side...

14:42.131 --> 14:44.466
...acting like children themselves.

14:44.634 --> 14:46.677
If Ethan had broken
two of Zachary's teeth...

14:46.844 --> 14:49.513
...Alan and I might have had
more of a knee-jerk reaction.

14:49.681 --> 14:51.765
I'm not sure we would
see the big picture.

14:51.933 --> 14:53.308
Sure you would.

14:53.476 --> 14:55.602
- She's right. I'm not so sure.
- You would.

14:55.770 --> 14:59.064
We all know this could have happened
the other way around.

14:59.357 --> 15:01.608
What does Zachary say about this?

15:01.776 --> 15:04.570
How is he experiencing it?

15:04.737 --> 15:07.656
He doesn't talk much.
A little overwhelmed, I guess.

15:07.824 --> 15:10.117
But he realizes that
he disfigured his schoolmate?

15:10.285 --> 15:14.580
No. No, he doesn't realize
that he disfigured his schoolmate.

15:14.747 --> 15:16.415
Why do you say that?

15:16.583 --> 15:18.208
Of course Zachary realizes.

15:18.376 --> 15:21.128
He realizes that this violent behavior
is unacceptable...

15:21.296 --> 15:23.213
...not that he disfigured
his schoolmate.

15:23.381 --> 15:25.841
You don't like the word,
but the word is appropriate.

15:26.009 --> 15:28.218
My son did not disfigure your son.

15:28.386 --> 15:29.845
Your son disfigured our son.

15:30.263 --> 15:32.681
Come back after school.
Look at his mouth, his teeth.

15:32.849 --> 15:34.099
Momentarily disfigured.

15:34.267 --> 15:36.602
His mouth will be fine
when the swelling goes down.

15:36.769 --> 15:40.022
As for the teeth, we'd be willing
to chip in for the best dental care.

15:40.189 --> 15:41.231
We've got insurance.

15:41.399 --> 15:43.567
What we want
is for the boys to patch it up...

15:43.735 --> 15:45.861
...make sure nothing like this
happens again.

15:46.029 --> 15:47.321
Let's set up a meeting.

15:47.488 --> 15:49.823
- Yeah, exactly.
- Should we be there?

15:49.991 --> 15:52.576
They don't need coaching.
Let them work it out like men.

15:52.744 --> 15:54.578
Like men. Alan, don't be ridiculous.

15:54.746 --> 15:57.080
On the other hand,
maybe we don't need to be there.

15:57.248 --> 15:59.333
Maybe it's better
if we weren't there, right?

15:59.500 --> 16:02.461
The issue is not whether we're there
or whether we're not there.

16:02.629 --> 16:04.796
The issue is,
do they wanna talk about this?

16:04.964 --> 16:06.298
Do they wanna work this out?

16:06.466 --> 16:07.924
- Ethan does.
- Does Zachary?

16:08.092 --> 16:11.094
- We won't give him a choice.
- It has to come from him.

16:11.262 --> 16:12.429
Zachary acts like a thug.

16:12.597 --> 16:15.140
We're not gonna wait around
for him to see the light.

16:15.308 --> 16:19.895
If Zachary sees Ethan in a punitive
context because he's forced to...

16:20.063 --> 16:23.065
...I just don't see anything positive
coming out of that.

16:23.232 --> 16:25.525
Mrs. Longstreet,
our son is a maniac.

16:25.693 --> 16:28.779
If you hope he'll suddenly
and spontaneously get all apologetic...

16:28.946 --> 16:29.946
...you're dreaming.

16:30.114 --> 16:33.200
Look, I'm sorry. I really do have
to get back to the office.

16:33.368 --> 16:36.119
Nancy, you'll stay.
You'll let me know what was decided.

16:36.287 --> 16:37.788
I'm no use to anyone anyway.

16:37.955 --> 16:40.582
Women always think you need
the man, you need the father.

16:40.750 --> 16:42.167
Like it would do any good.

16:42.335 --> 16:44.836
Look, I'm really sorry,
but I can't stay either.

16:45.004 --> 16:48.382
My husband has never been much
of an "I'll push the stroller" -type daddy.

16:48.549 --> 16:50.717
Well, it's too bad. It goes by so fast.

16:50.885 --> 16:52.886
Michael, you loved
taking care of the kids.

16:53.054 --> 16:56.056
- He had a ball pushing that stroller.
- Yeah, sure.

16:56.224 --> 16:58.975
So, what did we decide?

16:59.477 --> 17:02.229
Could you come over to our place
at about 7:30 with Ethan?

17:02.772 --> 17:04.690
Seven-thirty all right?

17:04.857 --> 17:06.775
Well, if you want my opinion....

17:06.943 --> 17:08.318
Yes, please.

17:08.486 --> 17:10.194
I think Zachary
should come over here.

17:10.570 --> 17:13.365
- Yeah, I agree.
- The victim shouldn't make the trip.

17:13.532 --> 17:14.782
- Yeah, that's right.
- Okay.

17:14.951 --> 17:16.785
Well, I can't be anywhere at 7:30.

17:16.953 --> 17:19.746
Who needs you?
You're useless, right?

17:19.914 --> 17:23.290
Seriously, I think it's important
for his father to come.

17:23.501 --> 17:25.502
Not tonight. Hello.

17:25.670 --> 17:28.046
- Tomorrow?
- Hello? I'm sorry.

17:28.214 --> 17:30.215
Can you hear me now?

17:33.344 --> 17:35.554
There's not a word
in the annual report.

17:35.722 --> 17:39.182
But the risk wasn't officially
established. There's no proof.

17:39.350 --> 17:41.893
- Okay.
- Yeah, have him call me back.

17:42.061 --> 17:43.353
Tomorrow?

17:44.313 --> 17:45.981
Tomorrow I'm in Washington.

17:46.149 --> 17:48.900
- You have business in Washington?
- The Pentagon.

17:49.068 --> 17:51.528
Look, the main thing
is to get the kids to talk.

17:51.696 --> 17:54.573
So I'll come over to your place
at 7:30 with Zachary...

17:54.741 --> 17:56.992
...and we'll just let them
talk it through.

17:57.160 --> 17:59.202
What? You don't seem convinced.

17:59.370 --> 18:02.664
If Zachary hasn't acquired
any accountability skills...

18:02.832 --> 18:05.417
...they'll glare at each other,
and it'll be a disaster.

18:05.585 --> 18:08.545
Accountability skills?
What are you talking about?

18:08.713 --> 18:13.133
- I'm sure your son is not a maniac.
- Zachary is not a maniac.

18:13.301 --> 18:15.802
- Yes, he is.
- Alan, don't be an idiot.

18:15.970 --> 18:17.929
- Why are you saying that?
- He's a maniac.

18:18.097 --> 18:19.598
How does he explain what he did?

18:19.766 --> 18:22.601
- He won't talk about it.
- He should. He should talk about it.

18:22.769 --> 18:24.269
That's a lot of "shoulds."

18:24.437 --> 18:27.606
He should come here. He should
talk about it. He should feel sorry.

18:27.774 --> 18:29.900
I'm sure you're much more evolved
than we are.

18:30.067 --> 18:32.986
We're trying to get up to speed.
Ln the meantime, indulge us.

18:33.154 --> 18:35.113
Hey, hey, hey. Come on.

18:35.281 --> 18:37.365
Come on. What happened here?

18:37.533 --> 18:39.326
This isn't what we're all about.

18:39.494 --> 18:41.369
I was talking about Zachary,
about him.

18:41.537 --> 18:44.080
- Got that. Right.
- Alan.

18:44.499 --> 18:47.751
You want some more coffee?
Some real coffee?

18:47.919 --> 18:49.669
Coffee.

18:50.671 --> 18:52.589
Thank you.

18:53.466 --> 18:54.591
Coffee. All right.

18:55.343 --> 18:57.803
It's okay, Pen. I'll get it.

19:35.716 --> 19:38.635
I see you're an art enthusiast.

19:38.845 --> 19:40.554
Yes.

19:43.099 --> 19:44.182
Bacon.

19:44.350 --> 19:46.518
Yeah, it's Bacon.

20:04.036 --> 20:06.538
Cruelty and splendor.

20:06.706 --> 20:09.708
Chaos. Balance.

20:12.044 --> 20:14.588
Ls Zachary interested in art?

20:14.755 --> 20:17.591
Not as much as he should be.
Your children are?

20:17.758 --> 20:20.927
Well, we try to make up for what's
lacking in the school curriculum.

20:21.095 --> 20:22.721
Right.

20:22.889 --> 20:25.515
We try to take them
to concerts and to galleries.

20:25.683 --> 20:30.812
We really believe that culture can be
such a powerful force for peace.

20:30.980 --> 20:33.732
- You're so right.
- Ls cobbler a cake or a pie?

20:33.900 --> 20:35.233
Here's an important question.

20:35.401 --> 20:38.945
I was in the kitchen. I was thinking,
"Why should pizza be a pie?"

20:39.113 --> 20:41.781
Oh, here, here.
Don't leave this miserable little piece.

20:41.949 --> 20:43.408
Go ahead. Go ahead. Here.

20:43.576 --> 20:45.619
Go on, you have that.

20:45.786 --> 20:47.829
Cobbler's a cake.
No crust on the bottom.

20:47.997 --> 20:49.539
It can't be a pie.

20:49.707 --> 20:52.334
- You're a gourmet chef.
- I like to cook.

20:52.501 --> 20:56.046
It's something you have to do
out of love or not at all.

20:56.255 --> 21:00.592
The way I see it, if there's no
crust on the bottom, it's not a pie.

21:00.801 --> 21:03.261
So how about you guys?
You have other kids?

21:03.429 --> 21:06.473
I have another son
by a former marriage.

21:08.517 --> 21:12.395
You know, I was wondering,
and I know this is not important...

21:12.563 --> 21:15.023
...but do you know
what they were arguing about?

21:15.399 --> 21:16.858
Because Ethan won't say a word.

21:17.026 --> 21:19.277
Ethan wouldn't let Zachary
be a part of his gang.

21:19.654 --> 21:22.530
- Ethan has a gang?
- And he called him a snitch.

21:22.698 --> 21:24.866
Did you know that Ethan
had a gang?

21:25.034 --> 21:28.036
No. But I'm thrilled to hear it.

21:28.204 --> 21:30.580
- Why are you thrilled?
- Because I had one.

21:30.748 --> 21:32.332
- I was the leader.
- So was I.

21:32.500 --> 21:34.292
What does the leader of a gang do?

21:34.460 --> 21:37.045
You know.
You got five or six guys who like you...

21:37.213 --> 21:39.965
...are willing to sacrifice themselves
for you.

21:40.132 --> 21:43.468
- Like in Ivanhoe.
- Exactly. Like in Ivanhoe.

21:43.636 --> 21:45.303
Who even knows
about Ivanhoe anymore?

21:45.471 --> 21:48.306
It's another role model,
like Spider-Man or whoever.

21:48.474 --> 21:50.642
Apparently, you know more
about this than we do.

21:50.810 --> 21:54.145
I guess Zachary wasn't
quite as silent as you first said.

21:54.897 --> 21:57.524
So why did he call him a snitch?

21:58.317 --> 22:00.944
Forget it. Silly question, right?

22:01.112 --> 22:02.612
What's the point? We don't care.

22:02.780 --> 22:05.281
We're not going to get into
these children's quarrels.

22:05.449 --> 22:07.033
- It's none of our business.
- Right.

22:07.201 --> 22:09.536
What is our business
is this unfortunate incident.

22:09.704 --> 22:11.454
And violence is our business.

22:11.622 --> 22:15.583
When I was the leader,
I beat up Jimmy Leach in a fair fight...

22:15.751 --> 22:17.627
...and he was bigger than me.

22:17.795 --> 22:20.505
What does that have to do
with anything, Michael?

22:20.673 --> 22:21.840
No, nothing.

22:22.008 --> 22:24.426
This isn't a fair fight.
These boys weren't fighting.

22:24.593 --> 22:27.554
Right. I was just
remembering something.

22:27.722 --> 22:29.681
It's not very different.

22:29.849 --> 22:31.808
Excuse me.
I'm sorry, there's a difference.

22:31.976 --> 22:34.144
- There is a difference.
- What's the difference?

22:34.311 --> 22:36.438
Me and Jimmy Leach
agreed to fight.

22:36.605 --> 22:38.398
- Did you mess him up?
- A little.

22:38.566 --> 22:40.400
Enough about Jimmy Leach.

22:41.527 --> 22:44.779
Look, do you mind
if I talk to Zachary?

22:44.947 --> 22:46.114
Of course not.

22:46.282 --> 22:48.575
I would never do it
without your permission.

22:48.784 --> 22:50.952
No, talk to him.
That's completely fine with us.

22:51.120 --> 22:52.662
And good luck with that.

22:52.830 --> 22:54.664
Stop it, Alan.

22:54.832 --> 22:56.291
Why do you say that?

22:56.459 --> 22:58.126
- Mrs. Longstreet...
- Penelope.

22:58.294 --> 23:00.920
I think we'll do better
on a first-name basis. Don't you?

23:01.088 --> 23:04.841
Right. Penelope, you're acting
on the desire to educate...

23:05.009 --> 23:07.635
I don't have to talk to him
if you don't want me to.

23:07.845 --> 23:10.305
Go. Lecture him, talk to him.
Do whatever you want.

23:10.473 --> 23:13.767
I don't understand
how you feel so uninvolved here.

23:13.934 --> 23:16.269
- Oh, Mrs. Longstreet...
- Penelope.

23:16.437 --> 23:18.938
Penelope, I'm very involved here.

23:19.106 --> 23:21.775
- My son injured another child.
- Deliberately.

23:21.942 --> 23:23.902
See, that's the kind of thing
that irks me.

23:24.070 --> 23:25.278
We know deliberately.

23:25.446 --> 23:27.864
- That makes the difference.
- Between what and what?

23:28.032 --> 23:29.657
We're talking about one thing here.

23:29.825 --> 23:31.659
Our kid picked up a stick,
hit your kid.

23:31.827 --> 23:33.453
- That's why we're here.
- Fruitless.

23:33.621 --> 23:36.581
Right. She's right, guys.
This kind of talk is fruitless.

23:36.749 --> 23:39.667
So why do you feel you need
to slip in the word "deliberately"?

23:39.835 --> 23:41.336
What lesson are you teaching me?

23:41.504 --> 23:44.172
All right, this is getting silly.

23:44.340 --> 23:46.758
My husband is all stressed out
over work stuff.

23:46.926 --> 23:50.136
I'll come back tonight with Zachary,
and we'll let them work it out.

23:50.304 --> 23:53.056
- I'm not stressed out in the least.
- Well, I am.

23:53.224 --> 23:56.309
- There's no reason to be stressed out.
- Yes. There is.

23:56.477 --> 23:58.019
Yeah?

24:01.023 --> 24:04.692
Well, no comment. No comment.

24:06.320 --> 24:07.570
No comment.

24:07.738 --> 24:10.281
Well, what if I say that we were
awaiting confirmation?

24:10.491 --> 24:13.701
What? If you recall it,
you're admitting liability.

24:13.869 --> 24:16.037
Yeah, but that embolism thing
is weighing on me.

24:16.205 --> 24:20.917
Recalling Antril
would be admitting your liability.

24:21.085 --> 24:25.213
At Christmastime, in the school play,
what did Zachary play?

24:25.381 --> 24:27.674
- Zachary played....
- Ebenezer Scrooge.

24:27.883 --> 24:30.885
...accounting irregularities.
- Ebenezer Scrooge. That's right.

24:31.053 --> 24:32.679
...in handcuffs two weeks
from now....

24:32.847 --> 24:35.598
Michael, do you remember
when he played Scrooge?

24:35.766 --> 24:37.225
Sure. Yeah, sure.

24:37.393 --> 24:39.602
Yeah, he was wonderful.

24:39.770 --> 24:41.479
He had that nightcap on.
He was funny.

24:41.647 --> 24:44.357
Talk about the victims
after the stockholders' meeting.

24:44.567 --> 24:47.652
- What did Ethan play?
- He played one of the kids.

24:47.820 --> 24:50.488
- One of the Cratchits.
- The Cratchit kids. That's right.

24:50.656 --> 24:54.868
We can't recall the drug because
three guys can't walk a straight line.

24:55.035 --> 24:56.077
Right.

24:56.245 --> 24:58.371
So for the time being,
don't make a move.

24:58.539 --> 25:00.415
All right, all right.
I won't say anything.

25:00.583 --> 25:03.751
All right. Okay, call you right back.

25:10.259 --> 25:11.342
Hello, Alan?

25:11.510 --> 25:14.637
They're in panic mode. They got
the media breathing down their necks.

25:14.805 --> 25:16.347
All right.

25:16.515 --> 25:19.893
I want a press release
that doesn't sound defensive at all.

25:20.060 --> 25:22.645
Just the opposite. Go for the jugular.

25:22.855 --> 25:26.357
Something like:
"TW Pharma is a target."

25:26.525 --> 25:28.735
Attempt at manipulation
of the stock price...

25:28.903 --> 25:31.321
...two weeks before
the stockholders' meeting.

25:31.488 --> 25:33.573
And where does this study
come from anyway?

25:33.741 --> 25:37.577
"How does this suddenly drop out of
a clear blue sky?" Et cetera, et cetera.

25:37.745 --> 25:39.454
Not one word about the health issue.

25:39.622 --> 25:43.374
Just one question:
Who's behind the study? Who?

25:43.542 --> 25:46.711
- Got it.
- Fine.

25:47.004 --> 25:49.464
Pharmaceutical companies.
The worst, right?

25:49.632 --> 25:51.424
Profit, profit, profit.

25:52.468 --> 25:55.553
Nobody said you should listen
to my conversation.

25:55.721 --> 25:58.181
Nobody said you should
have it under my nose.

25:58.349 --> 26:00.975
Wrong.
I'm totally forced to have it here.

26:01.143 --> 26:02.852
Against my will, believe me.

26:03.020 --> 26:06.981
Yeah. They just peddle the shit, right?
No one's responsible.

26:07.149 --> 26:10.235
Ln any therapeutic advance,
there are benefits and there are risks.

26:10.402 --> 26:12.820
Yeah, sure, I know. Still...

26:13.155 --> 26:15.907
...you got some funny line of work.

26:16.659 --> 26:19.619
- What does that mean?
- Michael, it's none of our business.

26:19.787 --> 26:21.579
Just funny line of work.

26:21.747 --> 26:24.666
- What about you? What do you do?
- I got a normal job.

26:24.833 --> 26:26.167
What's a normal job?

26:26.335 --> 26:28.253
I told you, I sell pots and pans.

26:28.420 --> 26:29.629
And door handles.

26:30.422 --> 26:32.590
And flush mechanisms
and a lot of other stuff.

26:32.758 --> 26:35.718
"Flush mechanisms."
I like that. That's interesting.

26:35.886 --> 26:37.345
Alan.

26:37.972 --> 26:40.640
I find that interesting.
Flush toilets are interesting.

26:40.808 --> 26:41.808
Why not?

26:41.976 --> 26:43.643
How many different kinds
do you have?

26:44.019 --> 26:45.144
There's two basic kinds.

26:45.312 --> 26:47.605
You got your push button
and your handle-operated.

26:47.773 --> 26:49.023
Yeah, right.

26:49.191 --> 26:51.317
- Depends where your water line is.
- I see.

26:51.485 --> 26:53.528
Either comes from the side
or from the bottom.

26:53.696 --> 26:55.822
- Right.
- One of my managers is an expert.

26:55.990 --> 26:57.573
I could introduce you if you want.

26:57.741 --> 26:59.742
You'll have to hump it out
to Jamaica, Queens, though.

26:59.910 --> 27:02.161
You seem like you know
your business pretty well.

27:02.329 --> 27:05.123
Are you planning on sanctioning
Zachary in any way?

27:05.291 --> 27:08.710
You two can have your plumbing
discussion some other time.

27:08.877 --> 27:11.671
- I don't feel well.
- What's the matter? Are you all right?

27:11.839 --> 27:13.798
You do look pale, honey.

27:13.966 --> 27:16.509
You're all white, yeah.

27:19.638 --> 27:21.973
- I'm nauseous.
- Some Reglan.

27:22.141 --> 27:25.226
- We got some Reglan, right?
- No. No, no. I'll be fine.

27:25.394 --> 27:28.146
A Coke. What you need is a Coke.

27:43.996 --> 27:46.080
It's not cold.

27:46.957 --> 27:48.583
- Mr. Cowan.
- It's not cold.

27:48.751 --> 27:49.876
Thank you.

27:50.044 --> 27:52.378
- Are you sure?
- Little sips.

27:52.546 --> 27:54.255
The Coke wasn't in the fridge.

27:54.423 --> 27:56.966
All right. Have him call me back.
Tell him right away.

27:57.134 --> 27:59.594
- Okay, Mr. Cowan.
- Okay.

28:00.054 --> 28:02.805
Ls Coke good for that?
It's more for diarrhea, isn't it?

28:02.973 --> 28:04.724
No, not only.

28:04.892 --> 28:06.642
Better?

28:10.481 --> 28:12.398
I think so.

28:12.608 --> 28:14.859
Mrs. Longstreet.

28:16.445 --> 28:19.322
If we decide to reprimand
our child...

28:19.490 --> 28:22.909
...we'll do it in our own way
and on our own terms.

28:23.077 --> 28:25.370
- Absolutely.
- What, absolutely?

28:25.537 --> 28:27.413
They're free to do as they see fit.

28:27.581 --> 28:29.749
- I don't agree.
- You don't agree about what?

28:29.917 --> 28:32.043
- They're not free.
- Ls that right?

28:32.211 --> 28:33.920
Go on. Sorry.

28:34.088 --> 28:35.380
Yeah?

28:36.340 --> 28:38.174
- Great.
- We're writing the statement now.

28:38.342 --> 28:40.051
Yeah, but don't forget.

28:40.219 --> 28:43.012
Nothing's been proven here.
Nothing's certain.

28:43.180 --> 28:45.640
Don't fuck this up.
If we don't get this right...

28:45.808 --> 28:48.643
...Walter will be out on his ass
in two weeks, and so will we.

28:48.811 --> 28:51.270
Enough, Alan!
Enough with the cell phone already!

28:51.438 --> 28:54.107
The here and now, goddamn it.

28:54.274 --> 28:56.943
- Call me back and read it to me.
- I'll call you back.

28:57.111 --> 28:59.362
What's wrong with you,
screaming at me like that?

28:59.530 --> 29:00.988
- Dennis heard every word.
- Good.

29:01.156 --> 29:04.283
I am sick of that fucking cell phone,
every minute of every day.

29:04.451 --> 29:07.620
Listen, Nancy. You should be thanking
me for agreeing to come here.

29:07.788 --> 29:09.622
- Really?
- Oh, God.

29:09.790 --> 29:11.582
- I'm gonna throw up.
- No, you're not.

29:11.750 --> 29:13.626
- I am.
- You wanna use the bathroom?

29:13.794 --> 29:15.670
Nobody's forcing you to stay.

29:15.838 --> 29:17.755
She's right.
Nobody's forcing you to stay.

29:17.923 --> 29:19.090
I feel dizzy.

29:19.258 --> 29:22.093
Stare at a point in space.
Stare at a point in space, Doodle.

29:22.261 --> 29:24.429
Hey, you can see
part of the el from here. Cool.

29:24.596 --> 29:27.765
- Get away from me. Leave me alone.
- Shouldn't she go to the bathroom?

29:27.933 --> 29:30.601
Go to the bathroom
if you have to throw up.

29:30.769 --> 29:31.769
Give her some Reglan.

29:31.937 --> 29:34.355
- It can't be the cobbler?
- No. I made it yesterday.

29:34.523 --> 29:36.816
- Don't touch me!
- Take it easy, Doodle.

29:36.984 --> 29:39.944
Yeah, come on. Don't get
all bent out of shape over nothing.

29:40.112 --> 29:42.613
My husband feels that
anything to do with the house...

29:42.781 --> 29:45.450
...the school, the backyard,
is my domain.

29:45.617 --> 29:47.660
- I do not.
- You do so.

29:47.828 --> 29:51.372
And I can understand why.
It's all so excruciatingly boring.

29:51.540 --> 29:52.999
It's excruciating.

29:53.167 --> 29:56.002
If it's so excruciating,
why have children in the first place?

29:56.170 --> 29:58.880
Maybe Zachary's picking up
on that lack of interest.

29:59.173 --> 30:03.009
- What lack of interest?
- You just said yourself.

30:04.553 --> 30:07.138
Go get a bucket. Go get a bucket!

30:16.106 --> 30:17.773
Stupid bitch.

30:17.941 --> 30:19.609
You should have gone
to the bathroom.

30:19.776 --> 30:20.943
This is ridiculous.

30:21.111 --> 30:22.987
- Your suit took a hit.
- What?

30:23.155 --> 30:24.822
Couldn't be the cobbler,
that I know.

30:24.990 --> 30:27.200
It's not the cobbler.
This is just nerves.

30:27.367 --> 30:29.869
Do you wanna clean up
in the bathroom or...?

30:32.372 --> 30:34.457
My Kokoschka.

30:35.667 --> 30:37.543
Here.

30:38.921 --> 30:40.421
Give her some Reglan.

30:40.589 --> 30:42.256
She can't keep anything down.

30:42.424 --> 30:44.634
Where's the bathroom?

30:45.552 --> 30:47.845
I'll show you.

30:53.143 --> 30:56.270
This is nerves. Just nerves.

31:08.617 --> 31:09.742
Thank you.

31:09.952 --> 31:13.955
It's like I always say, you can't get
over something while you're under it.

31:14.122 --> 31:17.333
With me, it's the back of my neck.
I get all blocked up back there.

31:17.501 --> 31:18.751
All right.

31:18.919 --> 31:21.170
What do we do with the Kokoschka?

31:21.338 --> 31:24.507
We can clean it. Maybe Lysol.

31:24.675 --> 31:26.259
The problem is gonna be drying it.

31:26.426 --> 31:28.219
Maybe plain water
and some cologne.

31:28.387 --> 31:29.428
Cologne?

31:29.596 --> 31:32.014
I got some of that Kronos stuff
I never use.

31:32.182 --> 31:34.308
The paper will warp.

31:34.476 --> 31:38.145
Then we'll blow-dry it and put some
books on top of it after to flatten it out.

31:38.313 --> 31:41.315
Or maybe iron it, like dollar bills.

31:41.650 --> 31:42.692
God.

31:42.859 --> 31:45.152
- I'll buy you another one.
- There is no other one.

31:45.320 --> 31:47.863
- It's been out of print for years.
- I'm so sorry.

31:48.031 --> 31:50.616
We can save it. Pen, let me do this.

31:50.784 --> 31:53.494
It's a reprint from the catalog
of the 1957 show in London.

31:53.662 --> 31:56.581
Get the blow-dryer and the cologne
in the bathroom cabinet.

31:56.790 --> 32:00.126
- Her husband's in the bathroom.
- He's not on the can.

32:00.294 --> 32:03.921
Look, I got most of it off.
There's just a little left on the Dolgans.

32:13.807 --> 32:15.641
Excuse me.

32:39.207 --> 32:40.708
Are you feeling better?

32:40.876 --> 32:41.917
Yeah.

32:42.085 --> 32:43.586
What, should I spray or...?

32:43.754 --> 32:45.004
Where's the blow-dryer?

32:45.172 --> 32:47.256
He's drying his pants.

32:47.466 --> 32:49.925
We'll wait. We should put the Kronos
on there last.

32:50.093 --> 32:51.135
Okay.

32:51.303 --> 32:52.928
Can I use the bathroom too?

32:53.096 --> 32:55.431
Yes. Of course. Of course.

33:01.021 --> 33:03.648
I don't know what to say.

33:04.483 --> 33:06.776
I am so sorry.

33:15.577 --> 33:17.286
Bring the blow-dryer
when you're done.

33:17.454 --> 33:18.454
So sorry.

33:19.081 --> 33:20.998
God.

33:21.708 --> 33:24.126
Unbelievable.

33:24.336 --> 33:27.213
Un-fucking-believable.

33:27.839 --> 33:30.758
Her cobbler's horrible.

33:31.051 --> 33:33.803
You stuffed your face.

33:34.554 --> 33:38.641
Look at my day.
I gotta get some food in me sometime.

33:50.404 --> 33:51.487
Oh, God.

33:52.239 --> 33:54.699
Freaking nightmare.

33:55.909 --> 33:58.285
He better watch it.
He's got me right on the edge.

33:58.453 --> 34:00.663
- She's horrible.
- Less.

34:00.831 --> 34:03.082
She's so fake.

34:03.375 --> 34:04.875
She doesn't bother me as much.

34:05.043 --> 34:06.127
They're both horrible.

34:06.294 --> 34:09.714
Why do you take their side
all the time? Sorry.

34:09.880 --> 34:11.757
I don't.
What's that supposed to mean?

34:11.925 --> 34:14.552
What the hell are we doing here?

34:15.094 --> 34:18.931
- I hope you're kidding.
- Why do you argue with her?

34:19.099 --> 34:21.141
We'd have been out of here
a long time ago...

34:21.309 --> 34:23.728
...if you didn't bicker
over every word.

34:23.895 --> 34:27.188
Would you rather I was a sheep
like her husband?

34:27.607 --> 34:29.315
Do you think it was the cobbler?

34:29.484 --> 34:31.694
Of course it was.

34:33.321 --> 34:35.864
A little warm Coke and:

34:37.159 --> 34:39.243
Oh, fuck.

34:39.494 --> 34:42.663
You're always mitigating.
You're trying to reconcile everything.

34:42.831 --> 34:44.581
- I am not.
- You are.

34:44.750 --> 34:46.542
You had a gang
and you were the leader.

34:46.710 --> 34:48.835
They can do whatever they want
with their son.

34:49.004 --> 34:51.338
Well, their son is a threat
to homeland security.

34:51.505 --> 34:53.674
Kid like that,
when he's a menace to society...

34:53.842 --> 34:55.176
...it's everybody's business.

34:55.342 --> 34:58.512
And I can't believe
that she barfed all over my books.

34:58.680 --> 35:01.182
When you know that
you're gonna toss your cookies...

35:01.349 --> 35:04.018
...you take some precautions.

35:04.895 --> 35:06.729
The Foujita.

35:06.897 --> 35:08.773
Now it's disgusting.

35:08.940 --> 35:11.525
I was right on the edge
with that toilet-flushing shit.

35:11.693 --> 35:12.860
You were incredible.

35:13.028 --> 35:15.654
- I held my own, right?
- Incredible.

35:15.822 --> 35:17.823
Jamaica, Queens.
Now that was genius.

35:17.991 --> 35:20.284
Little piece of shit.
What does he call her again?

35:20.452 --> 35:23.496
- Doodle.
- Yeah, right. Doodle.

35:23.747 --> 35:27.416
- Doodle.
- Yeah, I call her Doodle.

35:29.085 --> 35:31.378
I'm sorry. We didn't mean anything.

35:31.546 --> 35:36.258
You know, it's so easy to make fun
of other people's pet names.

35:36.426 --> 35:39.512
Michael, what do we call each other?
I'm sure it's worse, right?

35:40.138 --> 35:41.430
You wanted the blow-dryer.

35:41.598 --> 35:42.681
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

35:43.475 --> 35:46.936
We call each other "Darjeeling,"
like the tea.

35:48.438 --> 35:51.273
It's a lot more embarrassing
if you ask me.

35:52.067 --> 35:53.984
How is she feeling?
Ls she feeling better?

35:54.152 --> 35:55.402
Yeah, better.

35:55.570 --> 35:58.531
Yeah. I reacted badly.

35:58.698 --> 36:01.867
- I'm ashamed. I really am.
- Here.

36:02.035 --> 36:07.915
You know, I made a big deal
about the catalog, and I....

36:08.083 --> 36:09.458
I don't even know why.

36:09.626 --> 36:11.877
You get so absurdly attached
to these things...

36:12.045 --> 36:14.672
- ...and you don't even know why.
- Pull it taut though.

36:14.840 --> 36:16.841
- But hold onto the other side.
- I got it.

36:17.008 --> 36:19.385
You gotta pull it
because there's wrinkles on that.

36:19.553 --> 36:21.846
- The corners are wet.
- I'll get the corners.

36:22.013 --> 36:25.224
- It's gonna tear.
- He's right. It's gonna tear.

36:25.392 --> 36:27.059
- Okay. Well, here...
- It's dry enough.

36:27.227 --> 36:30.938
Okay. Put cologne on those,
and I'll finish this one.

36:33.775 --> 36:36.235
- So where does "Doodle" come from?
- Sorry.

36:36.403 --> 36:38.612
Yankee Doodle
or Cheez Doodle or...?

36:38.822 --> 36:40.990
It's from a song
from Guys and Dolls that goes:

36:42.242 --> 36:44.410
Oh, yeah, yeah. I know that one.

36:50.876 --> 36:53.878
- Yeah.
- Ours is from our honeymoon in India.

36:54.045 --> 36:57.006
We called each other "Darjeeling"
instead of "darling."

36:57.173 --> 36:59.133
It's so stupid.

36:59.968 --> 37:01.385
Maybe I should check on her.

37:01.553 --> 37:04.013
Yeah. Yeah, you do that, Darjeeling.

37:04.222 --> 37:06.390
Oh, Nancy. Hey.

37:06.558 --> 37:09.602
Well, I was worried about you.
Are you feeling better?

37:09.769 --> 37:12.521
Yeah. Better. I think so.

37:12.689 --> 37:16.275
If you're not sure,
stay away from the coffee table.

37:18.987 --> 37:22.281
I left a towel in the bathtub.
I didn't know where to put it.

37:22.449 --> 37:24.199
Perfect.

37:25.535 --> 37:27.161
You cleaned up.

37:27.329 --> 37:29.038
I am so sorry.

37:29.205 --> 37:30.789
Everything's fine. All is well.

37:30.957 --> 37:35.169
I'm sorry. I wasn't there for you.
I was so focused on the Kokoschka.

37:35.378 --> 37:37.421
- That's all right.
- No. I...

37:37.589 --> 37:41.008
- I behaved poorly.
- Please.

37:48.475 --> 37:52.978
Ln the bathroom, I was thinking.

37:53.313 --> 37:54.688
Yes?

37:54.856 --> 37:58.567
Yeah, maybe we glossed over the....

37:58.735 --> 38:00.402
The....

38:00.570 --> 38:02.279
Well, I mean....

38:02.447 --> 38:04.615
What? What is it?

38:05.408 --> 38:09.536
Well, name-calling
is a kind of abuse.

38:09.704 --> 38:11.789
- Sure.
- It depends.

38:11.957 --> 38:13.415
Right. It depends.

38:13.583 --> 38:15.709
Zachary has never been
a violent child.

38:15.877 --> 38:17.670
He must have had his reasons.

38:17.837 --> 38:19.797
Like getting called a snitch.

38:19.965 --> 38:21.757
Excuse me.

38:23.343 --> 38:24.385
Yeah, Walter.

38:24.552 --> 38:28.514
Alan, CNN has invited me
for a panel discussion.

38:28.890 --> 38:32.184
Well, as long as there are
no victims on the panel.

38:32.352 --> 38:35.688
No victims. I don't want you
sitting down with victims.

38:35.855 --> 38:37.314
Deny, deny, deny.

38:37.482 --> 38:39.400
If we have to, we'll sue the Journal.

38:40.402 --> 38:43.529
Well, we'll e-mail you the draft
of the press release.

38:43.697 --> 38:46.657
Walter, I'm sorry. I gotta go.

38:46.950 --> 38:49.368
Call me a snitch,
it gets a rise out of me.

38:49.536 --> 38:51.078
- Unless it's true.
- What?

38:51.246 --> 38:53.330
You know, if the shoe fits.

38:53.498 --> 38:56.208
- You think my son is a snitch?
- Come on. I'm joking around.

38:56.376 --> 38:58.085
So is yours anyway.

38:58.253 --> 39:00.879
- What do you mean, so is ours?
- He snitched on Zachary.

39:01.047 --> 39:03.882
- We coaxed it out of him.
- We're getting completely off point.

39:04.050 --> 39:06.343
Maybe you coaxed,
but he did snitch on him.

39:06.511 --> 39:08.262
- Nancy.
- "Nancy" what?

39:08.430 --> 39:11.807
- You think my son is a snitch?
- I don't think anything.

39:11.975 --> 39:14.518
Well, if you don't think anything,
don't say anything.

39:14.686 --> 39:16.729
- Don't make insinuations.
- Nancy...

39:16.896 --> 39:18.897
...there's no reason
to lose our cool here.

39:19.065 --> 39:22.568
Michael and I have gone out of our way
to be fair-minded and conciliating.

39:22.736 --> 39:24.778
Not so fair-minded.

39:24.946 --> 39:27.740
- Really?
- Superficially fair-minded.

39:27.907 --> 39:29.408
Doodle, I have to go.

39:29.576 --> 39:32.369
So go. Coward.

39:33.371 --> 39:36.623
Nancy, right now I'm in danger
of losing my most important client.

39:36.791 --> 39:39.960
This "caring parent" crap and
the bickering that goes along with it...

39:40.128 --> 39:42.421
Yeah, well, my son lost two teeth.
Two incisors.

39:42.589 --> 39:44.923
- We got that, right.
- One of them permanently.

39:45.091 --> 39:48.761
He'll get new teeth. Better ones.
No one chewed his ear off.

39:48.928 --> 39:52.431
It was a mistake not to consider
the source of the problem.

39:52.599 --> 39:53.599
There is no source.

39:53.767 --> 39:56.351
There's an 11-year-old kid
who hits people with a stick!

39:56.519 --> 39:58.520
- Armed with a stick.
- We took that word out.

39:58.688 --> 40:00.355
Took it out
because we asked you to.

40:00.523 --> 40:02.066
We took it out without argument.

40:02.233 --> 40:04.401
A word which deliberately
establishes intent...

40:04.569 --> 40:06.570
...without any hint
of a misunderstanding...

40:06.738 --> 40:08.197
...which excludes childhood.

40:08.364 --> 40:10.532
I don't think I can
stand this tone anymore.

40:10.700 --> 40:14.328
We're not quite on the same page,
you and I, right from the start.

40:14.496 --> 40:15.913
Mr. Cowan...

40:16.081 --> 40:19.792
...it is incredibly frustrating
to be continually upbraided...

40:19.959 --> 40:22.711
...for something that we, ourselves,
admitted was a mistake.

40:22.879 --> 40:25.297
The word "armed" wasn't right.
We took it out.

40:25.548 --> 40:28.050
Though, strictly speaking,
it certainly applies.

40:28.218 --> 40:30.552
Zachary was verbally abused
and he reacted.

40:30.720 --> 40:32.763
Now, if I'm attacked,
I defend myself...

40:32.931 --> 40:35.557
...especially when I'm all alone
against a whole gang.

40:35.767 --> 40:38.811
Well, you certainly perked up
since you tossed your cookies.

40:38.978 --> 40:40.604
Do you realize how crude that is?

40:40.772 --> 40:43.315
Look, we're all decent people,
all four of us.

40:43.483 --> 40:46.110
I don't know how we got carried away,
losing our tempers.

40:46.277 --> 40:49.113
- This is totally unnecessary.
- Stop it. Stop mitigating.

40:49.280 --> 40:52.574
We're only superficially fair-minded.
Why should we be fair-minded at all?

40:52.742 --> 40:54.785
No. No, I'm not gonna be led
down that path.

40:54.953 --> 40:55.953
What path?

40:56.121 --> 40:58.163
The path these two little shits
led us down.

40:58.331 --> 41:00.541
- Pen doesn't see things that way.
- "Penelope."

41:00.708 --> 41:03.502
- Sorry.
- So Ethan's a shit now.

41:03.670 --> 41:05.629
That really takes the cake.

41:05.797 --> 41:08.382
Look, that's it.
I really have to leave now.

41:08.550 --> 41:10.175
Yeah. So do I.

41:10.343 --> 41:13.804
Go. Go. I give up.

41:16.516 --> 41:19.017
- Hello.
- It's me, Mikey.

41:19.185 --> 41:21.436
- Oh, hi, Ma.
- Ls this a bad time?

41:21.604 --> 41:24.273
No. No, we got some friends over,
but go ahead.

41:24.440 --> 41:27.109
The surgeon told me to stop taking
my medication before the operation.

41:27.318 --> 41:31.321
Yes. Yes, you just do whatever
the doctors tell you to do.

41:31.489 --> 41:32.614
Yes.

41:32.782 --> 41:34.700
The surgeon told me
to stop all of them...

41:34.868 --> 41:38.537
...but Dr. Perlstein said
I could keep taking the Antril.

41:39.372 --> 41:40.539
- The what?
- The Antril.

41:40.707 --> 41:42.875
Should I stop taking the Antril too?

41:43.042 --> 41:46.962
Antril? You're taking Antril?

41:47.338 --> 41:50.340
Wait, hold on a second, Ma. Antril?

41:50.508 --> 41:52.342
That crap of yours is Antril?

41:52.510 --> 41:55.804
- My mother's taking it.
- Thousands of people take it.

41:55.972 --> 41:58.223
Mom. You gotta stop
taking that one right away.

41:58.391 --> 42:00.225
- You hear me? Right now.
- Why?

42:00.393 --> 42:04.521
Just do what I tell you. All right?
I'm gonna explain later.

42:04.689 --> 42:07.566
No. Dr. Perlstein said
I could keep taking the Antril.

42:07.734 --> 42:11.778
Mom, you tell Dr. Perlstein
that I said you can't take it.

42:11.946 --> 42:13.947
I won't touch it, Michael.

42:14.115 --> 42:15.532
Good.

42:16.618 --> 42:18.827
- Why red?
- So they can see me.

42:18.995 --> 42:21.705
- So who can see you?
- The cars. They all drive like crazy.

42:21.873 --> 42:25.125
Mom, that's ridiculous. Okay.
Mom. Mom.

42:26.669 --> 42:29.546
Mom. I have to call you back.
I told you we have company.

42:29.714 --> 42:31.798
- Okay. I love you.
- I hope so.

42:31.966 --> 42:33.926
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

42:35.470 --> 42:38.472
She got red crutches
in case she gets hit by a truck...

42:38.640 --> 42:40.933
...because she wanders out
in the street at night.

42:41.100 --> 42:43.352
They're giving her Antril
for her blood pressure.

42:43.519 --> 42:46.939
If she's taking it and she looks normal,
I'll take her deposition.

42:47.106 --> 42:48.690
Didn't I have a scarf?

42:48.858 --> 42:51.151
You know,
I don't like that attitude of yours.

42:51.319 --> 42:53.487
If my mother shows
even the slightest symptom...

42:53.655 --> 42:55.989
...my name will be on the top
of a class-action suit.

42:56.157 --> 42:58.408
- We'll have one anyway.
- Well, I should hope so.

42:58.576 --> 43:01.954
Doing the right thing is just futile.
Honesty's just stupidity.

43:02.121 --> 43:04.331
It just weakens you.
You let your guard down.

43:04.499 --> 43:07.709
Let's go, Nancy. That's enough
sermons and lectures for one day.

43:07.877 --> 43:10.379
Yeah, go ahead.
But let me tell you this:

43:10.546 --> 43:14.132
Now that I know you two,
I'm not surprised what's-his-name...

43:14.300 --> 43:17.970
Zachary may have
some behavioral issues.

43:18.513 --> 43:20.472
- When you killed that hamster...
- Killed?

43:20.640 --> 43:22.349
- Killed.
- I killed the hamster?

43:22.517 --> 43:25.310
Yes. You do everything you can
to make us feel guilty.

43:25.478 --> 43:27.771
You stake out the moral high ground
as your own...

43:27.939 --> 43:30.232
...but you, yourself, are a murderer.

43:30.400 --> 43:32.442
I definitely did not kill that hamster.

43:32.610 --> 43:33.652
- Worse.
- Worse!

43:33.820 --> 43:37.781
You left it out there, trembling with fear
in a hostile environment.

43:37.949 --> 43:41.118
That poor critter was probably eaten
by a dog or a rat.

43:41.286 --> 43:43.620
- She's right.
- What do you mean, "she's right"?

43:43.788 --> 43:44.955
I mean, come on. Michael.

43:45.123 --> 43:47.791
It's horrible what must have happened
to that poor animal.

43:47.959 --> 43:49.626
I thought the hamster
would be happy.

43:49.794 --> 43:52.045
I thought he'd go running around
happy as a clam.

43:52.213 --> 43:54.423
- Well, he didn't.
- And you just left him there.

43:54.590 --> 43:56.800
Because I can't touch
those things, okay?

43:56.968 --> 43:59.761
I can't touch anything of that family.
Penny, you know that.

43:59.929 --> 44:03.724
- He's afraid of rodents.
- Yes. I have a fear of rodents.

44:03.891 --> 44:07.769
And a fear of reptiles. Anything down
close to the ground. That's it. All right?

44:07.937 --> 44:11.315
What about you? How come
you didn't go downstairs and get it?

44:11.482 --> 44:13.066
Because I didn't know.

44:13.234 --> 44:15.610
Michael said this morning
that the hamster ran away.

44:15.778 --> 44:18.447
I went right out the door,
I went right down the block.

44:18.614 --> 44:20.741
I mean, I went to the basement!

44:20.908 --> 44:23.827
Penelope. It is completely unfair
that all of a sudden...

44:23.995 --> 44:27.414
...I'm in the hot seat about this hamster
that you had to tell them about.

44:27.582 --> 44:30.375
That is a family issue
that doesn't concern anybody but us.

44:30.543 --> 44:32.502
It's got nothing to do
with this situation.

44:32.670 --> 44:35.422
I can't believe I'm being called
a murderer in my own house.

44:35.590 --> 44:38.216
What does your house
have to do with tea in China?

44:38.384 --> 44:40.135
It's my house. I opened the door.

44:40.303 --> 44:43.055
The door is wide open
in a spirit of reconciliation...

44:43.222 --> 44:45.932
...to a couple people
who should be a little more grateful.

44:46.100 --> 44:48.727
Keep right on stroking your own ego.
It's beautiful.

44:48.895 --> 44:52.397
- So you have no remorse?
- No. I have no remorse.

44:52.565 --> 44:55.025
That animal was disgusting,
and I'm glad it's gone.

44:55.193 --> 44:57.361
- Michael, that's ridiculous.
- What's ridiculous?

44:57.528 --> 44:59.488
What, have you
lost your mind now too?

44:59.655 --> 45:03.158
Their son beats the shit out of Ethan,
and you're in my face over a hamster?

45:03.326 --> 45:05.577
What you did was wrong.
You can't deny that.

45:05.745 --> 45:07.537
I don't give a shit about the hamster!

45:07.705 --> 45:09.623
You're gonna when your daughter
gets home!

45:09.791 --> 45:13.210
Bring her on. I'm not gonna be told
how to act by some 9-year-old brat.

45:13.795 --> 45:16.338
I agree with him there 100 percent.

45:16.506 --> 45:18.673
And see? It's pathetic.

45:19.050 --> 45:21.426
Watch it, Penelope. Watch it!

45:21.594 --> 45:24.763
I've kept my shirt on till now,
but you are pushing me over the line.

45:24.931 --> 45:26.515
- And Ethan?
- What about Ethan?

45:26.682 --> 45:28.517
Well, is he sad too?

45:28.684 --> 45:31.186
Ethan's got other things
on his plate if you ask me.

45:31.354 --> 45:33.188
Ethan wasn't attached to Nibbles.

45:33.356 --> 45:34.439
Nibbles!

45:34.607 --> 45:36.983
What the hell kind of
pussy-ass name is that anyway?

45:37.151 --> 45:40.862
So if you feel no remorse,
why should our son?

45:41.030 --> 45:44.908
You know what? All this consultation
and consideration shit...

45:45.076 --> 45:46.368
...I'm sick to death of it.

45:46.536 --> 45:48.453
We were nice to you.
We bought tulips.

45:48.621 --> 45:51.790
My wife dressed me up as a liberal,
but the fact of the matter is...

45:51.958 --> 45:54.751
...I got no patience
for this touchy-feely bullshit.

45:54.919 --> 45:58.338
I am a short-tempered
son of a bitch, okay?

45:58.506 --> 45:59.798
We all are.

45:59.966 --> 46:01.758
No, I'm sorry. We are not.

46:01.926 --> 46:04.052
We are not all
short-tempered sons of bitches.

46:04.220 --> 46:06.430
- Not you, of course.
- No, not me. Thank God.

46:06.597 --> 46:09.182
No, not you, Darjeeling. Not you.

46:09.350 --> 46:11.560
You're so evolved.
You never go off half-cocked.

46:11.727 --> 46:13.270
Why are you being so aggressive?

46:13.438 --> 46:16.606
- I'm not, I'm being honest.
- No, you are. You're being aggressive.

46:16.774 --> 46:20.110
Know what? You put this little bash
together, and I let you recruit me...

46:20.278 --> 46:21.903
- You let me recruit you?
- Yes.

46:23.322 --> 46:25.574
- That is so disgusting.
- No, it's not.

46:25.741 --> 46:28.660
You're an advocate for civilized
behavior. That's fine with me.

46:28.828 --> 46:31.246
I'm an advocate for civilized behavior,
you bet I am.

46:31.414 --> 46:33.081
At least somebody around here is.

46:33.249 --> 46:35.876
You think it's better to be
a tempered son of a bitch?

46:36.043 --> 46:38.295
Nobody said that.
Nobody criticized you for that.

46:38.463 --> 46:40.297
- You did.
- We did not.

46:40.465 --> 46:42.883
What was I supposed to do?
Was I supposed to sue you?

46:43.050 --> 46:44.843
Was I supposed to
never speak to you?

46:45.011 --> 46:47.095
Tear you apart through
the insurance company?

46:47.263 --> 46:48.513
- Stop it, Penny.
- Stop what?

46:48.681 --> 46:50.515
You're blowing this out of proportion!

46:50.683 --> 46:53.268
Well, I don't care.

46:53.436 --> 46:55.812
You do everything you can
to escape the pettiness...

46:55.980 --> 46:59.983
...and you just end up humiliated
and completely alone.

47:00.151 --> 47:01.693
Yes. Walter.

47:02.612 --> 47:04.154
It's out everywhere.

47:04.322 --> 47:06.823
- Well, let them prove it.
- Yeah, right.

47:06.991 --> 47:09.826
- Let them prove it.
- Without some kind of response....

47:09.994 --> 47:11.453
No way.

47:11.621 --> 47:14.247
From where I sit,
the best thing for us to do is nothing.

47:14.415 --> 47:16.458
We're born alone and we die alone,
that's it.

47:16.626 --> 47:18.793
Who wants a little Scotch?

47:19.545 --> 47:22.714
Walter, I'm in a meeting right now.

47:22.965 --> 47:24.799
- I'll call you when I get back.
- Damn it.

47:24.967 --> 47:27.302
I'm living
with this totally negative person.

47:27.470 --> 47:29.638
- Who's negative?
- Me.

47:30.348 --> 47:33.558
This was the worst possible idea.
We should've never had this meeting.

47:33.726 --> 47:36.144
- I told you so. Yeah.
- You told me so?

47:36.354 --> 47:38.355
You told me we should've
never had this?

47:38.523 --> 47:41.107
- I didn't think it was a good idea.
- It was a good idea.

47:41.275 --> 47:43.360
Oh, come on. Who wants a little?

47:43.528 --> 47:45.820
You told me you didn't think
this was a good idea?

47:45.988 --> 47:47.739
- As I recall.
- As you recall.

47:47.907 --> 47:51.117
- Maybe just a little sip.
- Don't you have to go?

47:51.285 --> 47:54.204
At this point of the game,
I might as well have a little drink.

47:54.372 --> 47:58.291
You look me in the eye and you tell me
that we didn't both agree on this.

47:58.459 --> 48:01.253
Oh, God. Calm down, Penelope.
This is going nowhere.

48:01.420 --> 48:04.172
And who said not to touch
the cobbler this morning?

48:04.340 --> 48:07.092
Who said we should leave some
for the Cowans? Who said that?

48:07.260 --> 48:08.718
That was very nice of you.

48:08.886 --> 48:10.720
What does that
have to do with anything?

48:10.888 --> 48:12.639
What do you mean?

48:12.807 --> 48:16.476
- Guests are guests.
- You're lying. You're lying.

48:16.644 --> 48:17.727
He's lying.

48:17.895 --> 48:21.064
You know, my wife actually
had to drag me here today.

48:21.232 --> 48:24.109
When you grow up with a certain
John Wayne idea of manhood...

48:24.277 --> 48:28.029
...the impulse in this kind of situation
is not to talk it through.

48:28.197 --> 48:30.574
I thought the role model
was Ivanhoe.

48:30.741 --> 48:32.659
Same basic concept.

48:32.827 --> 48:34.327
Another aspect.

48:34.495 --> 48:36.288
Another aspect. Really?

48:36.455 --> 48:38.790
How much are you gonna
humiliate yourself, Michael?

48:38.958 --> 48:41.167
I can see I dragged him here
for nothing.

48:41.335 --> 48:43.378
What did you expect, Doodle?

48:43.546 --> 48:45.171
That is a ridiculous nickname.

48:45.339 --> 48:47.841
Some revelation
about universal values?

48:48.009 --> 48:49.718
This Scotch is unbelievable.

48:49.885 --> 48:53.138
Right? You see that?
Eighteen years old, single malt...

48:53.306 --> 48:55.974
...from a place in Scotland
still grows their own barley.

48:56.142 --> 48:59.019
What about the tulips?
Who got them?

48:59.186 --> 49:02.772
All I said was, "It's too bad we didn't
get any of those tulips this week."

49:02.940 --> 49:05.275
I didn't say anything about going
to Henry Street.

49:05.443 --> 49:08.820
Don't get all bent out of shape
over this. Penelope, it's not worth it.

49:08.988 --> 49:12.240
He got the tulips. Him and only him.

49:13.784 --> 49:15.452
What, we don't get a drink?

49:17.163 --> 49:19.539
Penelope and I would like a drink too.

49:32.178 --> 49:34.929
It's pretty funny
when you think about it.

49:35.097 --> 49:37.557
A devotee of Ivanhoe
and John Wayne...

49:37.725 --> 49:40.018
...but he's scared to pick up
an itty-bitty mouse.

49:40.186 --> 49:41.936
Stop it with the hamster.

49:42.104 --> 49:43.313
- Stop.
- She's right.

49:43.481 --> 49:44.606
It's laughable.

49:44.774 --> 49:47.692
- And hers?
- I don't think that'll be necessary.

49:47.860 --> 49:49.653
- Pour me a drink, Michael.
- No.

49:49.820 --> 49:50.945
- Michael.
- No.

49:51.113 --> 49:52.614
What is wrong with you, Michael?

49:57.244 --> 49:58.370
Fine. Fine.

49:58.537 --> 50:01.331
Drink. Drink. What does it matter?

50:01.499 --> 50:05.877
- ls drinking bad for you or something?
- No, it's great for me.

50:10.257 --> 50:12.676
Now I don't know.

50:16.639 --> 50:17.722
Mr. Cowan?

50:18.099 --> 50:19.557
"Alan."

50:19.725 --> 50:25.480
Alan. You see, you and I
didn't exactly hit it off...

50:25.648 --> 50:29.150
...but I live with a man
who has decided, once and for all...

50:29.318 --> 50:32.362
...that life is synonymous
with mediocrity.

50:32.530 --> 50:34.781
You know, it's very hard
to live with a man...

50:34.949 --> 50:37.075
...who's walled himself
inside that idea...

50:37.243 --> 50:41.121
...who doesn't wanna change anything,
who doesn't get excited about anything.

50:41.288 --> 50:44.582
What are you telling him this for?
He could care less.

50:44.750 --> 50:46.584
We have to believe.

50:46.752 --> 50:49.713
We have to believe
in some possible correction.

50:49.880 --> 50:52.507
He's the last guy on earth
you should be telling this to.

50:52.675 --> 50:55.260
I'll talk to anybody
I damn well please.

50:56.387 --> 50:59.139
Who the fuck is that now?

51:05.604 --> 51:07.856
- Hi, Ma.
- Mikey, it's me again.

51:08.023 --> 51:09.441
I forgot to ask how Ethan is.

51:09.608 --> 51:12.736
He's fine. He got his teeth
knocked out, but he's fine.

51:12.903 --> 51:14.529
- ls he in pain?
- Yeah, he's in pain.

51:14.697 --> 51:16.448
It hurts, but it'll pass.

51:16.615 --> 51:19.784
Ma, I told you we have company.
I gotta call you back, remember?

51:19.952 --> 51:22.579
- Okay, Mikey.
- Yeah. Bye.

51:22.747 --> 51:25.540
- He's still in pain?
- No.

51:25.708 --> 51:27.625
Then why do you worry
your mother?

51:27.960 --> 51:30.170
He has to worry her.
He can't help himself.

51:30.337 --> 51:33.548
All right, Penelope. That's enough.
What is this drama-queen bullshit?

51:33.716 --> 51:37.552
Penelope, nobody cares
about anything outside himself.

51:37.720 --> 51:40.805
Sure, we'd all like to believe
in some possible correction...

51:40.973 --> 51:43.016
...one we could author ourselves...

51:43.184 --> 51:46.352
...completely free
of selfish consideration.

51:46.520 --> 51:48.313
Like your writing this book
on Darfur.

51:48.481 --> 51:50.815
No. Which I think is great.

51:50.983 --> 51:53.276
You know.
I understand how you might say:

51:53.444 --> 51:55.987
"Okay, I'll pick a massacre.
History's full of them.

51:56.155 --> 51:57.405
I'm gonna write a book."

51:57.573 --> 51:59.616
Everybody has to save himself
somehow.

51:59.784 --> 52:02.118
I'm not writing this book
to save myself.

52:02.286 --> 52:05.163
You haven't read it.
You don't even know what's in it.

52:05.331 --> 52:07.248
Whatever.

52:07.416 --> 52:11.044
My God, that odor of Kronos
is killing me.

52:11.212 --> 52:14.005
- It fucking reeks.
- Well, you didn't exactly skimp.

52:14.173 --> 52:15.465
I am so sorry.

52:15.633 --> 52:18.259
No, it was my fault.
I sprayed like a madwoman.

52:18.427 --> 52:20.428
I don't know. Why...?

52:22.056 --> 52:23.765
Why can't things be easier,
you know?

52:23.933 --> 52:29.062
Why does everything
have to be so exhausting?

52:29.230 --> 52:30.730
You think too much.

52:30.898 --> 52:33.858
- Women think too much.
- There's an original response.

52:34.026 --> 52:36.194
I don't know what that means,
to think too much.

52:36.362 --> 52:38.863
You know, I don't know
how you can just go on living...

52:39.031 --> 52:41.991
...with absolutely no moral sense
of the world.

52:42.159 --> 52:44.536
- Look at me, I'm living.
- Oh, Michael, shut up.

52:45.120 --> 52:48.456
Your miserable complicity
just disgusts me.

52:48.624 --> 52:50.542
What happened
to your sense of humor?

52:50.709 --> 52:52.502
I don't have one
and I don't want one.

52:52.795 --> 52:54.003
If you ask me...

52:54.171 --> 52:57.090
...the couple is the worst ordeal
God has ever inflicted on us.

52:57.758 --> 53:00.385
- Marvelous.
- The couple and the family.

53:00.553 --> 53:03.388
No one's forcing you to air this out
in front of us, Michael.

53:03.556 --> 53:06.891
- And I might add, it's a little indecent.
- That doesn't bother him.

53:07.059 --> 53:09.394
You agree with me, don't you?

53:09.562 --> 53:12.730
This is all beside the point.

53:12.898 --> 53:15.400
Alan. Say something.

53:15.568 --> 53:17.443
He has a right to his ideas.

53:17.611 --> 53:19.320
Doesn't mean
he has to advertise them.

53:19.488 --> 53:21.197
Yeah, right. Maybe.

53:21.365 --> 53:23.199
We don't care about their marriage.

53:23.367 --> 53:26.202
We're here about the kids.
We don't care about their marriage.

53:26.370 --> 53:27.704
- Yeah, except...
- Except what?

53:27.872 --> 53:29.414
- It's related.
- It's related.

53:30.165 --> 53:31.332
Of course it's related.

53:31.500 --> 53:34.168
Ethan getting teeth busted out
is related to our marriage?

53:34.336 --> 53:36.546
- Of course it is.
- Sorry, I don't follow you.

53:36.714 --> 53:40.216
Look, take a step back
and look at the situation we're in.

53:40.384 --> 53:43.595
Children suck the life out of you
and leave you old and empty.

53:43.762 --> 53:45.638
That's the law of nature.

53:45.806 --> 53:48.641
You see these young couples
laughing all the way to the altar.

53:48.809 --> 53:52.020
You think, "They don't know.
Poor fuckers have no idea."

53:52.187 --> 53:55.481
They're happy. Nobody tells you
about this stuff in the beginning.

53:55.649 --> 53:56.816
I got this army buddy.

53:56.984 --> 53:59.277
He's gonna have a kid
with his new girlfriend.

53:59.445 --> 54:03.489
I said to him, "A kid? At our age?
What, are you stupid?"

54:03.657 --> 54:05.533
You got maybe
10, 15 good years left...

54:05.701 --> 54:07.702
...before you get cancer
or have a stroke...

54:07.870 --> 54:10.121
"...and you're gonna saddle yourself
with a kid?"

54:10.289 --> 54:12.624
- That's not really what you think.
- Yes, it is.

54:12.791 --> 54:14.918
- Of course it is. I think even worse.
- Yep.

54:15.085 --> 54:17.295
You're debasing yourself, Michael.

54:17.463 --> 54:19.297
Ls that right?

54:19.465 --> 54:23.843
Stop crying, Penelope.
It only makes it worse.

54:24.219 --> 54:25.345
Here.

54:25.512 --> 54:27.430
Of course, of course.

54:27.598 --> 54:30.266
- It's excellent, isn't it?
- It's excellent.

54:30.434 --> 54:32.185
Could I interest you in a cigar?

54:32.353 --> 54:34.812
- No cigars in the house.
- Too bad.

54:34.980 --> 54:37.148
Were you gonna smoke
a cigar now, Alan?

54:37.316 --> 54:40.735
I do what I want, Nancy. If I wanna
smoke a cigar, I smoke a cigar.

54:40.903 --> 54:43.613
I won't smoke it because
I don't wanna upset Penelope...

54:43.781 --> 54:47.241
...who's already on edge,
to put it mildly.

54:47.409 --> 54:51.245
Oh, quit sniffling like that.
She's right.

54:51.413 --> 54:54.958
You know, when women cry,
men are pushed to a breaking point.

54:55.125 --> 54:57.001
Although, unfortunately...

54:57.169 --> 55:00.880
...I must say, Michael's point of view
is completely justified.

55:01.048 --> 55:03.091
- Yeah.
- Yeah, can I read it to you?

55:03.258 --> 55:05.259
Yeah, sure. Go ahead.

55:06.428 --> 55:09.097
Yeah, put "New York"
and a specific time of day.

55:09.264 --> 55:11.683
- It's unbearable.
- What time of day?

55:11.850 --> 55:15.728
The time you send it.
It has to be hot off the press.

55:16.355 --> 55:19.941
Not "questions." "Deplores."
"Questions" is wishy-washy.

55:20.109 --> 55:22.318
I live with this night and day.

55:22.486 --> 55:23.528
One second.

55:23.696 --> 55:25.655
Our lives are chopped up
by the cell phone.

55:25.823 --> 55:27.156
This is very important.

55:27.700 --> 55:29.826
- It's always more important.
- Go ahead.

55:29.994 --> 55:32.870
What's happening somewhere else
is always more important.

55:33.038 --> 55:36.082
No. No, not "strategy." "Scheme."

55:36.250 --> 55:40.586
"A scheme surfacing two weeks from
the company's posting," et cetera.

55:40.754 --> 55:42.005
Ln the street.

55:42.172 --> 55:45.049
The dinner table. Everywhere.

55:46.301 --> 55:48.636
And "study" in quotes.

55:48.804 --> 55:50.763
Put the word "study" in quotes.

55:50.931 --> 55:53.349
I don't even protest anymore.

55:53.517 --> 55:56.060
Unconditional surrender.

55:56.603 --> 55:58.563
I feel like I'm gonna vomit again.

55:58.731 --> 56:01.315
- Where's that bucket?
- How am I supposed to know?

56:07.156 --> 56:10.241
Well, then just quote me. You know:
"This is a barefaced attempt"....

56:10.409 --> 56:12.160
Can you stand
over the bucket, please?

56:12.327 --> 56:14.037
- Pen.
- What?

56:14.204 --> 56:17.081
I mean, we're already set up
to handle this now.

56:17.249 --> 56:20.626
"... according to TW Pharma
attorney Alan Cowan."

56:20.794 --> 56:23.379
Okay, I'll make these corrections
and put it out there.

56:23.547 --> 56:26.924
AP, Reuters, newspapers,
trade journals.

56:27.092 --> 56:28.801
You know, the whole shebang.

56:31.805 --> 56:33.806
- What's wrong?
- She's gonna throw up again.

56:33.974 --> 56:35.475
You're so caring. It's touching.

56:35.642 --> 56:37.727
- Well, I'm worried.
- I didn't get that.

56:37.895 --> 56:41.272
- My mistake.
- Oh, come on, Nancy, will you?

56:41.440 --> 56:43.483
You and I don't have to do this.

56:43.650 --> 56:46.778
Their marriage is going downhill.
We don't have to try to compete.

56:46.945 --> 56:49.864
What gives you the right to say
our marriage is going downhill?

56:50.032 --> 56:51.824
What gives you the right?

56:53.619 --> 56:55.870
- Yeah. Walter.
- Alan, is the press release ready?

56:56.038 --> 56:59.624
Yeah, I just had it read back to me.
They'll send it over to you.

56:59.792 --> 57:01.542
Did you say this is an attempt to...?

57:01.710 --> 57:03.836
Manipulation.
Manipulation of the stock price.

57:04.004 --> 57:07.131
Listen, Walter,
I'll call you back in a minute, yeah.

57:07.299 --> 57:10.009
- I didn't say it. Steven did.
- "Michael."

57:11.553 --> 57:14.388
- I will not let you judge our family.
- Michael. Sorry.

57:14.556 --> 57:16.182
Don't judge our son either.

57:16.350 --> 57:19.435
That's different.
Your son brutalized our son.

57:19.603 --> 57:21.479
They're young. They're kids.

57:21.647 --> 57:24.941
Kids roughhouse in the playground.
Always have, always will.

57:25.109 --> 57:26.984
- It's a rule of nature.
- No, it isn't.

57:27.152 --> 57:28.194
Sure it is.

57:28.362 --> 57:31.739
It takes a little education to substitute
the rule of law for violence.

57:31.907 --> 57:35.993
The origin of law,
as you of course know, is brute force.

57:36.161 --> 57:37.745
Maybe if you're a caveman...

57:37.913 --> 57:40.456
- ...but not in this world.
- Tell me about this world.

57:40.624 --> 57:43.376
You're boring.
This whole conversation is boring.

57:43.544 --> 57:47.296
Penelope, I believe in
the god of carnage...

57:47.464 --> 57:50.424
...the god whose rule's been
unchallenged since time immemorial.

57:50.592 --> 57:53.386
You're interested in Africa, right?

57:54.012 --> 57:56.305
- What's the matter?
- Don't worry about me.

57:56.473 --> 57:58.432
- Nancy.
- I'm just fine.

57:58.600 --> 58:00.184
All right.

58:00.686 --> 58:02.770
See, I just got back from the Congo.

58:02.938 --> 58:05.439
They got kids there
trained to kill at the age of 8.

58:05.607 --> 58:08.776
Ln the course of their childhood,
they might kill hundreds of people.

58:08.944 --> 58:13.573
They kill with a machete,
a shotgun, a Kalash, a thumper.

58:13.740 --> 58:17.076
So obviously, when my kid
busts some other kid's tooth...

58:17.244 --> 58:20.496
...even two teeth with a bamboo switch
by the sandbox...

58:21.290 --> 58:23.708
...I'm not quite as shocked
and indignant as you are.

58:23.876 --> 58:25.001
Well, you should be.

58:25.169 --> 58:26.794
Thumper.

58:26.962 --> 58:30.339
- What they call a grenade launcher.
- That's what I called it.

58:30.507 --> 58:33.467
- You all right?
- I'm just fine.

58:34.678 --> 58:36.554
What's wrong with her?
What's the matter?

58:36.722 --> 58:38.723
Bile. It's nothing.

58:38.891 --> 58:41.392
Don't you tell me about Africa.

58:41.560 --> 58:43.811
I know all about suffering in Africa.

58:43.979 --> 58:45.354
I don't doubt it.

58:45.522 --> 58:47.690
That's all I've been thinking about
for months.

58:47.858 --> 58:51.319
Don't get her started on this, please.

58:52.362 --> 58:54.906
You know,
I'm actually starting to like you.

58:55.073 --> 58:56.199
Shut up.

58:56.366 --> 58:58.701
Talk about commitment
to world peace and stability.

58:58.869 --> 59:00.953
Shut the fuck up, Michael.

59:01.121 --> 59:03.247
Are you sure about that?

59:03.415 --> 59:05.583
Very sure.
This will do me some good.

59:05.751 --> 59:07.460
We live in New York.

59:07.628 --> 59:09.795
We don't live in Kinshasa.

59:09.963 --> 59:11.464
We live in New York City...

59:12.132 --> 59:14.800
...and with the customs
of Western society.

59:14.968 --> 59:17.845
So, what happens
at the Brooklyn Bridge playground...

59:18.013 --> 59:20.181
...that has to do
with Western values...

59:20.349 --> 59:25.102
...to which, whether you like it or not,
I happen to subscribe to.

59:25.270 --> 59:27.772
Beating your husband must be
one of those customs then.

59:27.940 --> 59:29.315
I'm warning you, Michael.

59:29.608 --> 59:33.069
She was all over you
like a bad rash.

59:33.237 --> 59:35.363
If I were you, it would melt my heart.

59:35.530 --> 59:38.407
He's making fun of you.
Do you believe it?

59:38.575 --> 59:40.409
- I could care less.
- No, really.

59:40.577 --> 59:42.995
Morally, you're supposed
to overcome your impulses...

59:43.163 --> 59:46.040
...but there are times
you don't wanna overcome them.

59:46.708 --> 59:49.710
I mean, who wants to say a Hail Mary
when you're having sex?

59:49.920 --> 59:53.297
- Can you buy this Scotch around here?
- No, this one, not very likely. No.

59:55.008 --> 59:56.509
Thumper.

59:57.552 --> 59:58.761
Thumper. Really.

59:58.929 --> 01:00:01.305
- Yeah, Thumper.
- That's what it's called.

01:00:03.016 --> 01:00:05.559
Why don't you just say
"grenade launcher"?

01:00:05.727 --> 01:00:06.936
Because that's a term.

01:00:07.104 --> 01:00:10.982
It's just like they say "Kalash"
and not "Kalashnikov" or "AK-47."

01:00:11.149 --> 01:00:13.651
- Who is "they"?
- That's enough, Nancy. That's enough.

01:00:13.819 --> 01:00:17.613
Hotshot firebrands like my husband,
you gotta understand...

01:00:17.781 --> 01:00:21.158
...it's hard for them to get excited
about what happens down the block.

01:00:22.035 --> 01:00:24.537
- Exactly.
- I don't see why.

01:00:24.705 --> 01:00:27.957
I don't see why.
We're all citizens of the world.

01:00:28.125 --> 01:00:32.628
I don't see why we can't have
some sense of community.

01:00:32.796 --> 01:00:36.799
Penelope.
Enough with the highfalutin claptrap.

01:00:37.926 --> 01:00:39.385
I'm gonna kill him.

01:00:40.178 --> 01:00:43.014
- Yeah.
- There's a problem with "barefaced."

01:00:43.181 --> 01:00:45.558
- Well, take out "barefaced."
- She's right.

01:00:46.310 --> 01:00:48.311
It's unbearable after a while.

01:00:48.478 --> 01:00:50.813
- A brazen attempt to...
- Manipulate the stock price.

01:00:50.981 --> 01:00:52.440
There you go.

01:00:52.607 --> 01:00:55.776
- Did he sign off on the rest?
- Yeah.

01:00:55.944 --> 01:00:57.945
That's fine. Good.

01:00:58.405 --> 01:01:01.324
What were we talking about?
Thumpers?

01:01:01.491 --> 01:01:03.284
We were saying...

01:01:03.452 --> 01:01:06.203
...that, despite what
my husband thinks...

01:01:06.371 --> 01:01:09.332
...whether it happens here
or on the other side of the world...

01:01:09.499 --> 01:01:13.085
...we all have to be
collectively concerned.

01:01:13.253 --> 01:01:16.756
"Collectively concerned."

01:01:16.923 --> 01:01:19.925
Nancy, it's absurd to drink
in your condition.

01:01:20.093 --> 01:01:22.762
What condition? I'm perfect.

01:01:22.929 --> 01:01:26.599
Now, that's an interesting idea.

01:01:26.767 --> 01:01:28.351
Yeah.

01:01:29.061 --> 01:01:32.521
No. No interviews
before we get this release out.

01:01:32.689 --> 01:01:34.023
Mr. Cowan...

01:01:34.191 --> 01:01:37.360
...can you please put an end
to this nerve-racking conversation?

01:01:37.527 --> 01:01:41.739
Just remind him the stockholders
won't give a shit.

01:01:41.907 --> 01:01:45.826
The stockholders won't... Nancy.
Are you out of your fucking mind?

01:01:45.994 --> 01:01:48.412
- Hello! What's going on?
- There.

01:01:49.581 --> 01:01:51.123
Shit!

01:01:51.291 --> 01:01:53.918
- Oh, my God.
- Way to go!

01:02:01.843 --> 01:02:03.427
The blow-dryer. The blow-dryer.

01:02:03.595 --> 01:02:06.472
You should be put in a home, dear.

01:02:07.391 --> 01:02:11.227
I got everything in there.

01:02:11.395 --> 01:02:13.646
It was brand-new.
I spent hours setting this up.

01:02:13.814 --> 01:02:15.231
I can't believe you did that.

01:02:15.399 --> 01:02:17.483
That was a really
irresponsible thing to do.

01:02:17.651 --> 01:02:19.318
I got everything in there.

01:02:19.736 --> 01:02:21.404
My whole life was in there.

01:02:22.406 --> 01:02:25.991
- His whole life.
- Here.

01:02:27.786 --> 01:02:31.330
I wanna get the SIM card and
the battery out. How do you do that?

01:02:32.707 --> 01:02:36.085
- I just got it. I don't know.
- Let me see. Let me see.

01:02:36.545 --> 01:02:38.337
It's stuck.

01:02:38.922 --> 01:02:41.257
And they think it's funny.
They think it's funny!

01:02:44.302 --> 01:02:47.930
- Penelope.
- Penelope. This is not funny.

01:02:48.640 --> 01:02:51.976
My husband has spent
the entire afternoon drying things.

01:02:52.519 --> 01:02:54.770
No, no. This way.

01:03:00.652 --> 01:03:02.903
Forget it. It's over.

01:03:03.071 --> 01:03:04.905
- You gotta wait.
- Forget it. It's over.

01:03:08.410 --> 01:03:10.578
You wanna use the phone?

01:03:14.541 --> 01:03:16.500
I must say....

01:03:18.628 --> 01:03:21.547
What must you say, Michael?

01:03:21.715 --> 01:03:24.800
No. I don't even know what to say.

01:03:25.760 --> 01:03:28.304
I'd say it feels better like this.

01:03:28.472 --> 01:03:32.224
I'd say it feels better like this.
Wouldn't you?

01:03:34.352 --> 01:03:36.395
Men get so attached to their toys.

01:03:36.563 --> 01:03:38.481
It diminishes them.

01:03:38.648 --> 01:03:40.357
They lose their credibility.

01:03:40.525 --> 01:03:42.193
Oh, God.

01:03:42.360 --> 01:03:44.820
I dated this guy once...

01:03:44.988 --> 01:03:47.156
...and then I saw him
carrying this bag...

01:03:47.324 --> 01:03:49.783
...this rectangular bag
with a shoulder strap.

01:03:49.951 --> 01:03:52.828
It's a man's bag
with a shoulder strap.

01:03:52.996 --> 01:03:54.580
It was over.

01:03:54.748 --> 01:03:57.458
A bag with a shoulder strap,
that's the worst.

01:03:57.626 --> 01:04:00.336
But the cell phone
always at his fingertips...

01:04:00.504 --> 01:04:02.838
...that's the worst too.

01:04:03.006 --> 01:04:05.966
Men should have both hands free.

01:04:06.134 --> 01:04:08.594
They should have both hands free.

01:04:08.762 --> 01:04:11.805
I've got a John Wayne idea
of manhood too.

01:04:11.973 --> 01:04:13.807
What was it he had? A Colt .45.

01:04:13.975 --> 01:04:15.976
Something that empties a room.

01:04:16.144 --> 01:04:18.479
Any man that doesn't give off
those loner vibes...

01:04:18.647 --> 01:04:22.942
...just doesn't come off
as having any substance.

01:04:23.401 --> 01:04:27.696
So, Michael, Michael.
I guess you're happy now.

01:04:27.864 --> 01:04:31.367
Our little touchy-feely, whatever you
said, is coming apart at the seams.

01:04:31.535 --> 01:04:33.369
But, hey, you know what?

01:04:33.537 --> 01:04:37.831
This almost feels good,
in my opinion.

01:04:37.999 --> 01:04:42.294
Ln my opinion, some people can
handle their liquor better than others.

01:04:42.462 --> 01:04:44.922
- I'm as normal as can be.
- Yeah, right.

01:04:45.090 --> 01:04:49.510
Yeah. I'm beginning to see things
with a pleasant serenity.

01:04:49.678 --> 01:04:52.888
That's good. A pleasant serenity.

01:04:53.056 --> 01:04:56.225
I don't know why you're wasting
yourself out in the open, Darjeeling.

01:04:56.393 --> 01:04:57.601
Shut the hell up.

01:04:57.769 --> 01:04:59.478
Here. Alan.

01:04:59.646 --> 01:05:02.314
- Relax.
- No cigars in the house.

01:05:02.482 --> 01:05:04.066
You got your Hoyo de Monterro.

01:05:04.234 --> 01:05:06.402
You got your Partagas D,
number 4.

01:05:06.570 --> 01:05:08.445
You got your Hoyo Coronacion.

01:05:08.613 --> 01:05:09.905
Where did you get these?

01:05:10.073 --> 01:05:12.324
- You don't wanna know.
- Seriously.

01:05:12.492 --> 01:05:14.451
The Spanish connection.

01:05:14.619 --> 01:05:17.037
My cookware guy is going out
with a flight attendant.

01:05:17.205 --> 01:05:19.915
She brings home, like,
two boxes a week.

01:05:20.667 --> 01:05:23.168
You can't smoke in a house
with an asthmatic child.

01:05:23.336 --> 01:05:25.713
And why are you telling him
your whole life story?

01:05:25.880 --> 01:05:27.464
- Who has asthma?
- Our son.

01:05:27.632 --> 01:05:29.466
We had a goddamn hamster,
didn't we?

01:05:29.634 --> 01:05:32.261
That's true. Pets aren't good
when you're asthmatic.

01:05:32.429 --> 01:05:34.638
No. Not good at all.

01:05:34.806 --> 01:05:37.558
Even goldfish aren't
necessarily recommended.

01:05:37.726 --> 01:05:40.269
Do I have to listen to this crap?

01:05:40.437 --> 01:05:45.441
I guess I'm the only one that doesn't
see things with a pleasant serenity.

01:05:45.609 --> 01:05:47.526
The truth is...

01:05:47.694 --> 01:05:49.278
...I've never been so unhappy.

01:05:49.446 --> 01:05:51.280
This is the unhappiest day
of my life.

01:05:51.448 --> 01:05:53.407
You're an unhappy drunk.

01:05:53.992 --> 01:05:55.534
Michael...

01:05:55.702 --> 01:05:59.705
...every word out of your mouth
just slays me.

01:05:59.873 --> 01:06:01.457
I don't get drunk.

01:06:01.625 --> 01:06:05.628
I had a couple of sips
of your shitty 18-year-old single malt...

01:06:05.795 --> 01:06:09.673
...that you trot out like it's
the 18th Wonder of the World.

01:06:09.841 --> 01:06:11.508
I don't get drunk.

01:06:11.676 --> 01:06:13.636
I wish I could.
Believe me, I wish I could.

01:06:13.803 --> 01:06:19.224
I wish I could just drown
every last sorrow in a good, stiff drink.

01:06:21.102 --> 01:06:24.021
My husband is unhappy too.

01:06:24.481 --> 01:06:28.108
Look at him all hunched over
like he was left on the side of the road.

01:06:29.027 --> 01:06:32.446
I think this is the unhappiest day
of his life too.

01:06:32.614 --> 01:06:35.908
- It is.
- I'm sorry, Doodle.

01:06:46.544 --> 01:06:48.253
Hello.

01:06:49.881 --> 01:06:51.507
- Hello.
- Mikey.

01:06:51.675 --> 01:06:55.260
Mom. I told you we have company.
You remember?

01:06:55.428 --> 01:06:58.597
Why do you want me
to stop taking my Antril?

01:06:58.932 --> 01:07:01.100
Because it's medication
that can kill you.

01:07:01.267 --> 01:07:02.726
- It's poison.
- It is not.

01:07:02.894 --> 01:07:04.561
Now, Mom, Mom.

01:07:04.729 --> 01:07:07.356
There's someone here
who can explain.

01:07:07.524 --> 01:07:10.275
- Here. Tell her.
- Tell her what?

01:07:10.443 --> 01:07:13.779
Tell her what you know
about that poisonous shit of yours.

01:07:14.030 --> 01:07:18.117
What can he tell her?
He doesn't know anything.

01:07:19.494 --> 01:07:20.911
Hello, ma'am.

01:07:21.079 --> 01:07:23.539
- How are you?
- I'm all right for now.

01:07:23.707 --> 01:07:26.583
They want to take me off my Antril.

01:07:26.751 --> 01:07:28.377
My operation is a week away.

01:07:28.545 --> 01:07:30.212
Yeah. Are you in pain?

01:07:30.380 --> 01:07:31.964
I can't be on my feet, doctor.

01:07:32.132 --> 01:07:35.467
Yeah. Well, the operation
will fix that.

01:07:39.180 --> 01:07:41.849
- The other leg too?
- Are you an orthopedist?

01:07:42.016 --> 01:07:44.268
No, I'm not an orthopedist.

01:07:44.436 --> 01:07:46.770
She keeps calling me "doctor."

01:07:46.938 --> 01:07:49.064
Doctor. What a laugh.

01:07:49.649 --> 01:07:51.066
- Hang up.
- Hello.

01:07:51.234 --> 01:07:53.152
- Yeah.
- What about my Antril?

01:07:53.319 --> 01:07:57.114
Well, do you have
any balance issues?

01:07:57.282 --> 01:07:58.407
No....

01:07:59.534 --> 01:08:00.617
- Yeah.
- Will it kill me?

01:08:00.785 --> 01:08:05.372
No, of course not. Not at all.
It can't kill you.

01:08:05.540 --> 01:08:07.207
Don't listen to what people say.

01:08:07.375 --> 01:08:10.878
Still, yeah, it might be a good idea
not to take it for a while.

01:08:11.045 --> 01:08:12.171
For how long?

01:08:12.338 --> 01:08:14.631
Just until this operation
is behind you.

01:08:14.799 --> 01:08:16.466
They're gonna ruin me.

01:08:16.634 --> 01:08:19.595
If you could see me, you'd be
surprised how well-preserved I am.

01:08:19.763 --> 01:08:23.223
Yeah, sounds like
you're in excellent shape.

01:08:23.390 --> 01:08:25.100
All right. You got that, Ma?

01:08:25.268 --> 01:08:27.478
You stop taking that medication.

01:08:27.645 --> 01:08:29.395
- Just do as you're told!
- Okay, okay.

01:08:29.564 --> 01:08:32.649
- All right? I love you.
- Love you too.

01:08:34.319 --> 01:08:36.278
I can't take her anymore.

01:08:36.446 --> 01:08:37.821
The shit I put up with.

01:08:37.988 --> 01:08:41.073
All right. Should we wrap this up?

01:08:41.242 --> 01:08:44.118
Should I come back here tonight
with Zachary? Let's decide.

01:08:44.287 --> 01:08:46.705
This is getting to be, like,
who cares?

01:08:46.872 --> 01:08:49.082
That is what we're here for after all.

01:08:49.250 --> 01:08:52.836
Now I'm gonna be sick.
Where's that bucket?

01:08:54.839 --> 01:08:56.465
That's enough. That's enough.

01:08:56.633 --> 01:09:01.470
- That's enough.
- I’d say both sides share the blame.

01:09:01.638 --> 01:09:02.888
So....

01:09:03.807 --> 01:09:06.475
There you are.
Both sides share the blame.

01:09:06.643 --> 01:09:10.062
- Are you serious?
- Excuse me?

01:09:10.229 --> 01:09:11.772
That's what you really think?

01:09:11.939 --> 01:09:14.399
It's what I think, yes.

01:09:14.859 --> 01:09:17.944
My son, Ethan, who had to take
two codeine at 3 in the morning...

01:09:18.112 --> 01:09:21.990
- ...he shares the blame?
- He's not necessarily innocent.

01:09:22.408 --> 01:09:24.493
Get out of my house.
You get the fuck out.

01:09:24.661 --> 01:09:26.745
Get the fuck out of my house!

01:09:26.912 --> 01:09:30.249
My bag! My bag! My...

01:09:30.416 --> 01:09:32.000
- Alan.
- What is going on here?

01:09:32.167 --> 01:09:33.585
They've totally lost it.

01:09:33.752 --> 01:09:36.296
Alan! Do something.

01:09:36.464 --> 01:09:39.258
- "Alan, do something."
- Shut your mouth.

01:09:39.425 --> 01:09:43.804
She broke my makeup mirror
and my perfume.

01:09:43.971 --> 01:09:45.514
Stand up for me.

01:09:45.682 --> 01:09:48.850
Why don't you stand up for me?

01:09:49.810 --> 01:09:51.435
Let's go, Nancy.

01:09:51.604 --> 01:09:54.773
- It's not like I'm strangling her.
- What did I do to you?

01:09:54.941 --> 01:09:56.942
The blame is not shared.

01:09:57.110 --> 01:10:00.654
The victim and the criminal
are not the same.

01:10:00.822 --> 01:10:04.032
- The criminal?
- Give it a fucking rest, Penelope.

01:10:04.200 --> 01:10:06.702
Enough with
this politically correct bullshit!

01:10:06.870 --> 01:10:09.997
- Which I believe in.
- That you believe. You believe.

01:10:10.164 --> 01:10:13.083
This crush you got
on these Sudan sambos...

01:10:13.251 --> 01:10:15.085
...is spilling over
into everything now!

01:10:15.253 --> 01:10:16.461
I'm horrified.

01:10:16.629 --> 01:10:19.548
How could you be
so openly despicable?

01:10:19.716 --> 01:10:24.136
Because I feel like it.
I feel like being openly despicable.

01:10:24.304 --> 01:10:26.638
One day you will understand
the sheer horror...

01:10:26.806 --> 01:10:29.141
...of what's happening
in that part of the world...

01:10:29.309 --> 01:10:33.437
...and you will be ashamed
of your contemptibly nihilistic attitude.

01:10:33.605 --> 01:10:37.816
Yes, Darjeeling,
you're so wonderful.

01:10:38.276 --> 01:10:39.943
You're the best and the brightest.

01:10:40.111 --> 01:10:43.071
Yes, I am! Yes, I am!

01:10:43.239 --> 01:10:44.907
Let's get out of here, Alan.

01:10:45.074 --> 01:10:47.868
These people are monsters.

01:10:48.036 --> 01:10:50.579
- Stop it, Nancy.
- No, no. No.

01:10:50.747 --> 01:10:55.334
I wanna drink some more.
I wanna get drunk off my ass.

01:10:55.501 --> 01:10:59.421
This bitch throws my bag against
the ceiling, nobody lifts a finger.

01:10:59.589 --> 01:11:02.507
- I wanna be blind drunk.
- You're drunk enough.

01:11:02.675 --> 01:11:05.844
How can you let her
call our son a criminal?

01:11:06.304 --> 01:11:10.849
We come over here to work things out
with them, and they insult us...

01:11:11.017 --> 01:11:12.142
...they browbeat us...

01:11:12.310 --> 01:11:15.270
...they lecture us about being
good citizens of the planet.

01:11:15.438 --> 01:11:19.650
I am glad our son
kicked the shit out of your son...

01:11:19.817 --> 01:11:23.236
...and I wipe my ass
with your human rights.

01:11:25.114 --> 01:11:29.451
Get a couple of drinks in her and,
bam, her true self comes out.

01:11:29.702 --> 01:11:33.288
What happened to that gracious,
demure woman with the soft eyes?

01:11:33.456 --> 01:11:35.874
I told you. I told you!

01:11:36.042 --> 01:11:38.126
- What did you tell him?
- That she's a fake.

01:11:38.294 --> 01:11:40.587
That woman is totally fake.
I'm sorry.

01:11:40.755 --> 01:11:43.632
- When did you say that?
- When you were drying your pants.

01:11:43.800 --> 01:11:46.802
You'd known her 15 minutes,
and you already knew she was fake?

01:11:46.970 --> 01:11:49.721
Yeah. Well, I pick up on these things
pretty quickly.

01:11:49.889 --> 01:11:51.556
- She does.
- I got a nose for them.

01:11:51.724 --> 01:11:53.850
Fake. What does that mean?

01:11:54.018 --> 01:11:55.602
I don't wanna listen to this.

01:11:55.770 --> 01:11:57.980
Why do you put me through this,
Alan?

01:11:58.147 --> 01:11:59.815
Relax, Nancy.

01:11:59.983 --> 01:12:02.818
She's a phony. She doesn't care
any more than you do.

01:12:02.986 --> 01:12:06.196
- It's true. That's true.
- It's true. He said it's true.

01:12:06.364 --> 01:12:08.365
They don't give a shit.

01:12:08.533 --> 01:12:12.119
It's so obvious right from
the beginning. They don't give a shit.

01:12:12.495 --> 01:12:14.413
She doesn't give a shit either.
It's true.

01:12:14.580 --> 01:12:16.164
- Like you do?
- Well...

01:12:16.332 --> 01:12:17.958
No, let him talk, honey.

01:12:18.126 --> 01:12:20.919
Explain to me, Michael,
exactly how you care.

01:12:21.087 --> 01:12:22.671
What does that mean anyway?

01:12:22.839 --> 01:12:25.632
You're more credible
when you're being openly despicable.

01:12:25.800 --> 01:12:29.011
Truth is, nobody here cares
except maybe Penelope.

01:12:29.178 --> 01:12:30.804
One must acknowledge
her integrity.

01:12:30.972 --> 01:12:33.223
I don't need your acknowledgment.

01:12:33.391 --> 01:12:35.392
I don't need your acknowledgment!

01:12:35.560 --> 01:12:37.728
But I do care. I really do care.

01:12:37.895 --> 01:12:41.523
Yes, Doodle,
we care in a hysterical way.

01:12:41.691 --> 01:12:44.860
Not like heroic figures
of a social movement.

01:12:45.361 --> 01:12:49.156
I saw your friend Jane Fonda
on TV the other day.

01:12:49.323 --> 01:12:52.659
Made me wanna run out
and buy a Ku Klux Klan poster.

01:12:53.411 --> 01:12:55.412
My friend Jane Fonda?

01:12:55.580 --> 01:12:58.206
What does that mean?
What the hell does that mean?

01:12:58.374 --> 01:13:03.503
You're the same breed, the same kind
of involved, problem-solver woman.

01:13:03.671 --> 01:13:05.255
Those are not the women we like.

01:13:05.423 --> 01:13:09.342
The women we like are sensual,
crazy, shot full of hormones.

01:13:09.510 --> 01:13:11.386
The gatekeepers of the world...

01:13:11.554 --> 01:13:14.723
...the ones who wanna show off
how perceptive they are?

01:13:14.891 --> 01:13:16.683
Huge turnoff.

01:13:16.851 --> 01:13:20.729
Even poor Michael,
your own husband, is turned off.

01:13:20.897 --> 01:13:22.189
Don't you speak for me.

01:13:22.356 --> 01:13:25.817
We don't give a shit
what women you like.

01:13:25.985 --> 01:13:28.278
Where do you get off
just spouting these opinions?

01:13:28.446 --> 01:13:31.698
You are the one man whose opinion
we don't give a shit about!

01:13:31.866 --> 01:13:34.409
She's screaming.

01:13:34.577 --> 01:13:37.370
Quartermaster on a slave ship.

01:13:37.538 --> 01:13:39.331
She doesn't scream?

01:13:39.499 --> 01:13:42.125
She didn't just scream
that your little asshole...

01:13:42.293 --> 01:13:44.294
...was right to beat up ours?

01:13:44.462 --> 01:13:45.545
He was right.

01:13:45.713 --> 01:13:49.424
At least our kid
isn't a little wimpy-ass faggot.

01:13:49.717 --> 01:13:53.345
Yours is a fucking snitch!

01:13:53.513 --> 01:13:55.639
Let's go, Alan.

01:13:55.807 --> 01:13:58.225
Why are we still in this house?

01:13:58.392 --> 01:14:00.435
Exactly.

01:14:01.854 --> 01:14:02.896
Here.

01:14:03.064 --> 01:14:06.817
This is what I think
of your stupid tulips.

01:14:06.984 --> 01:14:09.778
Your hideous flowers.

01:14:11.405 --> 01:14:15.450
This is the worst day of my life too.
