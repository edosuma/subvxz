01:48.928 --> 01:49.961
Mom.

02:06.894 --> 02:07.794
Crux, Crux!

02:09.759 --> 02:10.661
Crux, Crux!

02:14.395 --> 02:15.593
Crux!

02:31.128 --> 02:31.961
Crux!

03:50.160 --> 03:50.993
Girls.

03:54.792 --> 03:57.060
All right, gentlemen and ladies.

03:57.093 --> 03:58.993
Class is almost over.

03:59.026 --> 04:01.658
Whoa, whoa, not so fast.

04:01.691 --> 04:03.859
You all have an essay due
at the end of the week,

04:03.893 --> 04:06.691
and since we are studying
the Bill of Rights,

04:06.725 --> 04:07.758
mm-hmm,

04:07.792 --> 04:08.926
each of you will be required

04:08.959 --> 04:12.691
to write me a three page
paper on one of the amendments

04:12.725 --> 04:15.926
and how it is being reflected
in current society today.

04:15.958 --> 04:20.125
So, pick a number
from my magic bowl

04:20.159 --> 04:22.691
and that's what
you're stuck with.

04:22.725 --> 04:24.025
Okay?

04:24.059 --> 04:26.292
You can pick a current event,

04:26.325 --> 04:29.892
a court case, a more modern law.

04:29.925 --> 04:32.925
I'm gonna be kinda lenient on
how do you want to do this,

04:32.958 --> 04:35.892
so feel free to mix it up.

04:35.925 --> 04:37.159
If you have any questions,

04:37.192 --> 04:41.292
you can see me before
or after class.

04:41.325 --> 04:42.657
Lucky.

04:42.690 --> 04:43.159
She's got the
Eleventh Amendment.

04:43.192 --> 04:44.757
That is so easy.

04:44.792 --> 04:46.757
Ooh, witchcraft.

04:46.792 --> 04:48.757
I got freedom of speech.

05:01.024 --> 05:01.825
Hey.

05:01.858 --> 05:03.991
Hey, hey!

05:04.024 --> 05:05.590
- Freeze!
- Stop right there!

05:05.624 --> 05:06.924
- Let me see your hands!
- What are you guys watching?

05:06.957 --> 05:08.957
Some witch
trying to cross the border.

05:08.991 --> 05:10.191
Get on the ground!

05:13.258 --> 05:14.924
What'd they shoot her with?

05:14.957 --> 05:15.791
Salt.

05:16.924 --> 05:18.991
So should I
sprinkle salt on her?

05:19.024 --> 05:20.224
How funny is that?

05:20.258 --> 05:21.324
That's funny.

05:21.358 --> 05:24.091
Well, salt supposedly
repels magic,

05:24.124 --> 05:26.324
but that's for
witches, not bitches.

05:26.358 --> 05:27.891
Slut.

05:27.924 --> 05:29.689
Someone's salty.

05:29.723 --> 05:31.191
You guys broke up
three months ago.

05:31.224 --> 05:32.589
I know, thank you.

05:34.723 --> 05:36.791
That's what I meant,
what does he see in her?

05:37.891 --> 05:39.157
She probably puts out.

05:39.190 --> 05:40.924
Oh, shut up, Sofie.

05:42.357 --> 05:43.757
Whatever, it's not like I'm
gonna have to see her face

05:43.791 --> 05:45.357
after Prop Six passes.

05:45.390 --> 05:46.623
You really think
it's gonna pass?

05:46.656 --> 05:48.157
Yeah, definitely.

05:48.190 --> 05:50.689
And then all those red headed
freaks will be locked up too.

05:51.457 --> 05:53.123
That's what you should
write about for your essay,

05:53.157 --> 05:54.223
Prop Six.

05:54.257 --> 05:55.689
I could come over after school

05:55.724 --> 05:56.923
and we could write
our essays together,

05:56.956 --> 06:00.656
and I could bring that weird,
healthy popcorn my mom makes...

06:00.688 --> 06:02.756
Actually, I can't
do that today, but.

06:05.190 --> 06:07.588
Sorry.

06:07.622 --> 06:09.190
No, fine.

06:09.223 --> 06:10.823
- Whatever.
- Okay.

06:10.856 --> 06:12.622
- Oh, okay.
- Bye.

06:12.655 --> 06:13.655
- Bye.
- Bye.

07:47.288 --> 07:48.121
Mom?

07:53.888 --> 07:54.721
Boys?

08:00.654 --> 08:05.654
Hello?

09:29.385 --> 09:30.619
Hello?

10:11.217 --> 10:14.251
What are you doing in my room?

10:14.284 --> 10:17.851
Seriously, I thought my mom
told you to stay in the walls.

10:17.885 --> 10:19.985
And the blinds were open.

10:25.017 --> 10:26.618
What are you doing?

10:59.283 --> 11:01.784
Claire, we're home!

11:23.316 --> 11:25.616
I'm gonna get you so hard!

11:30.050 --> 11:32.150
- Tag!
- Oh, hey, that's not fair.

11:32.183 --> 11:34.116
Yes, I got you
fair and square.

11:41.050 --> 11:43.616
Corey, George, out.

11:43.649 --> 11:45.616
Put your new toothbrushes
in your bathroom please.

11:45.649 --> 11:47.082
Thank you.

11:47.115 --> 11:49.082
Mom, that witch
was in my room again.

11:51.916 --> 11:53.883
Yeah, Jacob's coming
for her tonight.

12:04.249 --> 12:05.149
He's early.

12:11.115 --> 12:12.681
No, wait.

12:12.715 --> 12:14.182
We have a system.

12:14.215 --> 12:15.215
You wait for him in here.

12:22.782 --> 12:23.581
Jacob.

12:24.281 --> 12:25.681
Good afternoon.

12:30.082 --> 12:30.915
I didn't think

12:30.948 --> 12:32.848
you were stopping
by until tonight.

12:32.882 --> 12:34.681
I'm ahead
of schedule today.

12:37.681 --> 12:39.081
Thank you.

12:39.114 --> 12:40.782
There's a jug in the pantry
waiting for recycling.

12:52.048 --> 12:53.114
Just crouch down.

12:59.181 --> 13:00.248
Got it!

13:00.282 --> 13:01.714
Lovely day, ladies.

13:01.747 --> 13:03.214
- Drive safely.
- Always do.

14:13.079 --> 14:14.112
Keep quiet.

14:53.879 --> 14:55.612
Evening, officer.

14:55.645 --> 14:56.279
Evening.

14:58.212 --> 14:59.078
Can I help you?

15:00.812 --> 15:02.978
Can you please step
out of the vehicle, sir?

15:12.379 --> 15:15.111
You gonna need
my registration?

15:16.146 --> 15:16.978
No.

15:33.178 --> 15:37.544
Can you please open the
back of your truck, sir?

15:45.943 --> 15:48.278
Yes, sir.

16:29.942 --> 16:33.043
You are
Jacob Gordon, correct?

16:33.077 --> 16:34.576
Yes, sir.

16:37.976 --> 16:40.576
There's nothing in that
thing that shouldn't be there,

16:40.610 --> 16:42.043
is there?

16:42.077 --> 16:43.210
No, sir.

16:45.077 --> 16:47.110
So you wouldn't mind
if I searched it then?

16:48.244 --> 16:49.077
I would mind.

16:52.976 --> 16:54.210
It's my property.

16:57.976 --> 16:59.009
Okay.

17:15.175 --> 17:17.209
I hate liars.

17:23.376 --> 17:24.209
You smoke?

17:25.840 --> 17:26.674
No.

17:28.741 --> 17:30.009
Neither do I.

18:46.074 --> 18:46.974
Hey, sweetheart.

18:47.007 --> 18:48.974
I didn't know you were still up.

18:49.007 --> 18:50.906
Yeah, I was just
doing homework.

18:58.341 --> 18:59.174
Mom.

19:04.839 --> 19:05.907
We need to stop.

19:08.907 --> 19:11.107
If we stick to the
rules, it's a safe system.

19:11.141 --> 19:12.672
It's not just that.

19:17.041 --> 19:19.306
We can't be risking
our lives for them.

19:20.639 --> 19:21.273
Them?

19:22.273 --> 19:23.106
Yes.

19:30.240 --> 19:32.706
And, why?

19:33.606 --> 19:34.773
They're criminals.

19:36.306 --> 19:37.973
These women don't
have a choice, Claire.

19:38.006 --> 19:39.606
They're born with their powers.

19:39.639 --> 19:40.738
They choose to use them.

19:40.772 --> 19:42.173
Is that what
they're teaching you at school?

19:42.206 --> 19:43.772
What?

19:43.805 --> 19:44.572
Or is it those girls
you've been hanging out with?

19:44.606 --> 19:46.638
What is her name, Jane.

19:47.772 --> 19:49.173
For the last time,
her name is Jen.

19:49.206 --> 19:51.206
And maybe if you let
me be a normal teenager

19:51.240 --> 19:52.738
and have my friends
over to the house,

19:52.772 --> 19:54.206
you wouldn't be
asking questions.

19:54.240 --> 19:55.638
Your friends
can come over to the house.

19:55.671 --> 19:56.939
No, they can't!

19:57.838 --> 19:59.306
Because I have to lie.

20:01.073 --> 20:03.239
Everything outside
of this is a lie.

20:04.006 --> 20:06.738
Everything I do in
this world is for you.

20:06.772 --> 20:07.973
You can't just say that

20:08.006 --> 20:10.571
every time my opinion
differs from yours.

20:11.906 --> 20:14.972
Why did we have to move
out here after dad died?

20:15.005 --> 20:16.205
How was that for me?

20:16.239 --> 20:18.205
I didn't want to uproot
my whole entire life.

20:18.239 --> 20:20.072
You did that to me.

20:20.105 --> 20:21.738
How was that for me?

20:21.772 --> 20:23.172
Okay, calm down.

20:23.205 --> 20:25.105
Don't let your emotions
get the best of you.

20:25.139 --> 20:26.139
Do you need your inhaler?

20:26.172 --> 20:28.305
I'm fine, I'm fine.

20:28.339 --> 20:29.905
Breathe.

20:35.804 --> 20:37.737
Who is that?

21:02.771 --> 21:05.637
Oh hi, sorry, I didn't
think you could hear me.

21:05.670 --> 21:07.004
No.

21:07.038 --> 21:08.138
Pantry.

21:08.171 --> 21:09.904
- Okay, fantastic.
- Sure.

21:10.871 --> 21:11.904
All righty.

21:13.837 --> 21:16.736
And when will these expire?

21:16.770 --> 21:18.804
Tomorrow, tomorrow morning.

21:18.837 --> 21:21.038
And for you.

21:21.071 --> 21:22.171
All right, thank you.

21:57.970 --> 21:58.803
Hello.

22:00.903 --> 22:01.803
I'm Martha.

22:05.103 --> 22:06.702
And this is my daughter, Claire.

22:09.635 --> 22:10.237
Fiona.

22:13.037 --> 22:14.203
This is my sister, Shae.

22:19.702 --> 22:20.970
Okay.

22:21.003 --> 22:23.336
Girls, I'm gonna take
you up the side stairs

22:23.369 --> 22:25.770
and show you where you'll
be staying tonight.

22:26.870 --> 22:27.703
Okay?

22:41.769 --> 22:43.302
I hope this will do.

22:43.336 --> 22:44.835
Yeah, of course.

22:46.702 --> 22:47.735
Shae.

22:52.969 --> 22:54.169
Thank you, Martha.

22:56.036 --> 22:58.601
You're so kind to
open your home to us.

22:58.634 --> 23:00.202
Two knocks for safe.

23:00.236 --> 23:01.634
One for not safe.

23:02.869 --> 23:03.702
Okay.

23:04.735 --> 23:05.769
Night.

24:04.768 --> 24:05.601
Crux!

25:33.599 --> 25:34.632
Shae.

25:36.832 --> 25:39.032
I'm so sorry to wake you, um?

25:39.065 --> 25:40.665
Claire.

25:40.699 --> 25:43.265
Claire, my sister,
Shae, she sometimes goes,

25:43.298 --> 25:44.532
she sleepwalks.

25:48.332 --> 25:49.265
It's okay.

25:49.298 --> 25:50.132
Hey, hey.

25:51.831 --> 25:53.998
Shae, it's okay.

25:54.032 --> 25:54.865
It's okay.

25:56.898 --> 25:58.232
She's burning.

25:58.265 --> 26:00.065
- No, no, no, no, no, no.
- She's burning.

26:00.098 --> 26:01.198
This is a nightmare.

26:03.332 --> 26:04.165
See me?

26:05.364 --> 26:06.265
Sorry.

26:06.297 --> 26:08.297
Come on, let's go to bed.

27:07.663 --> 27:08.764
Oh, wait, no.

27:08.797 --> 27:09.929
Guests first, guests first.

27:09.963 --> 27:12.330
Oh no, it's fine.

27:12.363 --> 27:13.797
- Oh, okay.
- Yes!

27:14.697 --> 27:15.530
Okay.

27:17.296 --> 27:18.130
George?

27:20.662 --> 27:21.296
Good morning.

27:28.829 --> 27:31.030
Is Jacob coming this morning?

27:31.063 --> 27:31.896
He is.

27:37.163 --> 27:38.963
Oh, okay, hey, listen.

27:38.996 --> 27:40.596
Be safe.

27:40.629 --> 27:41.229
I love you.

27:41.262 --> 27:43.229
Have fun at school.

27:43.262 --> 27:45.262
Claire, do you
have your inhaler?

27:45.295 --> 27:46.696
Yes.

27:46.729 --> 27:48.062
Okay,
raised by wolves.

27:48.095 --> 27:49.796
I'll make you some
fresh pancakes.

28:49.827 --> 28:50.661
I'm sorry.

28:53.161 --> 28:54.194
Is he coming?

28:57.228 --> 28:58.560
Perhaps not today.

29:01.329 --> 29:06.228
Hey, do you guys want
to see something cool?

29:06.261 --> 29:10.527
I have no idea when it was
built, but it is something.

29:15.227 --> 29:16.260
Ready?

29:18.294 --> 29:23.160
There is a whole nother
house behind the wall.

29:24.328 --> 29:25.227
Whoa.

29:27.893 --> 29:29.694
- Shae, stop, Shae.
- It's okay.

29:29.727 --> 29:30.926
She'll be fine.

29:30.960 --> 29:32.761
The whole thing
just loops around.

29:32.793 --> 29:34.294
She'll probably
have fun in there.

29:36.726 --> 29:41.294
Why don't we leave the
door open for her, okay?

29:43.593 --> 29:45.127
I'm gonna attempt
to make some tea.

30:14.092 --> 30:15.227
This is such
an old house, I swear.

30:15.260 --> 30:16.925
Now, the stove isn't working.

30:20.092 --> 30:22.526
I haven't heard her laugh
like that in a long time.

30:27.260 --> 30:28.625
Since our mom.

30:36.658 --> 30:38.059
I've missed that.

30:47.059 --> 30:48.725
Hello?

30:58.859 --> 31:00.558
Why do you help
people like us?

31:02.792 --> 31:04.192
It's a complicated question.

31:20.924 --> 31:21.724
Shae?

31:25.724 --> 31:26.524
Shae?

31:27.291 --> 31:28.657
Shae?

31:28.691 --> 31:31.058
Shae, are you okay?

31:31.091 --> 31:31.924
Shae?

31:32.758 --> 31:33.591
Shae!

31:34.291 --> 31:35.958
You okay?

31:35.991 --> 31:37.025
Is she trapped?

31:37.057 --> 31:37.958
She shouldn't be.

31:37.991 --> 31:39.990
The passageways are wide.

31:41.057 --> 31:41.858
Shae!

32:04.623 --> 32:05.623
Shae?

32:05.656 --> 32:06.291
Fiona?

32:07.890 --> 32:08.857
Oh my god.

32:10.057 --> 32:11.090
Are you okay?

32:11.125 --> 32:12.790
- Yeah.
- Are you okay?

32:12.823 --> 32:13.857
Oh my god.

32:15.623 --> 32:16.790
Let's go upstairs.

32:24.923 --> 32:26.090
Mrs. Denny said that
there weren't gonna be

32:26.124 --> 32:28.590
any logarithmic
functions on the exam.

32:28.623 --> 32:29.857
And guess what?

32:29.890 --> 32:30.790
- Logarithmic functions.
- Logarithmic functions.

32:30.823 --> 32:32.324
Stop talking about math.

32:32.357 --> 32:35.090
We don't have to
talk about math.

32:38.090 --> 32:39.523
What is that?

32:42.190 --> 32:44.324
Border patrol?

32:44.357 --> 32:47.056
I think so.

32:49.956 --> 32:52.989
Holy shit,
I think those are witches.

32:53.023 --> 32:54.722
Are you sure?

32:54.756 --> 32:59.655
Yeah, they probably got caught
trying to cross to Mexico.

33:20.289 --> 33:21.722
Eyes forward.

33:39.023 --> 33:41.855
- Are you okay?
- Inhaler, inhaler.

33:46.955 --> 33:47.888
My inhaler.

34:36.652 --> 34:39.955
Okay, boys, like
we talked about.

34:39.987 --> 34:40.987
Girls, in the wall.

34:52.021 --> 34:53.154
Come on.

34:53.187 --> 34:54.819
Calmly and quietly.

34:54.853 --> 34:55.954
It'll all be fine.

35:00.221 --> 35:01.719
Martha, good afternoon!

35:01.753 --> 35:02.954
Cynthia, hi.

35:02.987 --> 35:04.886
I accidentally
made two batches.

35:04.919 --> 35:06.221
Wow, lucky me.

35:06.254 --> 35:07.087
It looks amazing.

35:07.121 --> 35:08.254
Yeah.

35:08.287 --> 35:09.619
I'm so sorry, I
can't have you come in.

35:09.652 --> 35:10.753
Oh.

35:10.786 --> 35:12.087
The boys just
started their homework.

35:14.920 --> 35:16.719
Well...

35:21.786 --> 35:23.853
Cynthia, are you all right?

35:25.253 --> 35:26.053
I'm just...

35:28.020 --> 35:30.753
Well actually, I heard
something alarming today.

35:30.786 --> 35:31.719
Yes.

35:31.753 --> 35:32.652
What did you hear?

35:33.719 --> 35:35.320
They caught
somebody from our town

35:35.353 --> 35:37.852
transporting witches
across the border.

35:39.186 --> 35:39.986
Well.

35:40.020 --> 35:40.852
Yeah.

35:43.586 --> 35:46.552
Well, I can't say
that I'm surprised.

35:46.586 --> 35:48.953
There are a lot
of untrustworthy,

35:48.986 --> 35:51.551
un-American people around here.

35:51.585 --> 35:52.286
I know.

35:52.320 --> 35:53.886
And frankly, I'm appalled

35:55.852 --> 35:58.120
that the government hasn't
made the wall higher.

35:58.153 --> 36:00.120
I mean, they're
getting over somehow.

36:00.153 --> 36:02.752
I don't understand why
the Mexican government

36:02.785 --> 36:03.986
is giving them asylum.

36:04.020 --> 36:05.020
They're not refugees.

36:05.053 --> 36:05.852
They're criminals.

36:05.886 --> 36:09.152
Yes, criminals.

36:09.185 --> 36:11.651
But you know, other countries,

36:11.685 --> 36:15.185
their laws aren't as
reasonable as ours.

36:16.085 --> 36:17.785
I mean, Cynthia,

36:17.818 --> 36:20.985
I believe that we can
count on our government

36:21.019 --> 36:21.985
to keep us safe.

36:23.052 --> 36:23.885
I hope.

36:26.751 --> 36:27.852
Thank you so much.

36:27.885 --> 36:28.952
- Oh, nothing.
- Smells like heaven.

36:28.985 --> 36:30.650
I'm gonna cut it up

36:30.684 --> 36:31.650
and give it to the boys as
a treat after they're done.

36:31.684 --> 36:32.285
Okay.

36:32.319 --> 36:33.152
- Bye.
- Bye.

37:22.884 --> 37:24.683
My family was
killed in a car crash,

37:24.716 --> 37:28.051
and the other driver was the
daughter of a convicted witch.

37:29.218 --> 37:31.151
She shouldn't have
been driving at all.

37:32.084 --> 37:35.516
Under Prop Six, she
wouldn't have a license.

37:37.817 --> 37:41.583
So, vote yes on Prop Six

37:41.616 --> 37:43.150
and keep our streets safe

37:43.183 --> 37:45.649
from anyone with
magic in their blood.

37:47.117 --> 37:49.649
No magic is good magic.

38:31.850 --> 38:32.716
Crux, Crux!

38:34.249 --> 38:35.182
Crux, Crux!

40:04.881 --> 40:06.080
Claire?

40:06.114 --> 40:06.947
Oh, Jesus.

40:08.748 --> 40:11.748
Hey, hey, hey,
you're just dreaming.

40:14.214 --> 40:15.647
You're just dreaming.

40:15.681 --> 40:17.546
Look at me, look at me.

40:17.580 --> 40:18.947
Breathe.

40:18.980 --> 40:21.047
Breathe in, out, in, out.

40:22.947 --> 40:24.713
You're just dreaming.

40:28.180 --> 40:30.747
Breathe, breathe,
breathe, breathe, breathe.

40:30.780 --> 40:31.646
There you go.

40:31.680 --> 40:32.512
Out, in.

40:33.579 --> 40:34.214
Out, good.

40:36.014 --> 40:37.980
It was just a dream.

40:38.014 --> 40:39.213
Totally.

40:52.146 --> 40:56.113
Shae's sleepwalking must
be rubbing off on you.

40:59.846 --> 41:01.613
Here.

41:01.646 --> 41:02.946
Drink up, it'll help you sleep.

41:04.079 --> 41:04.879
Sorry.

41:08.279 --> 41:09.712
Sorry, that was...

41:14.879 --> 41:16.013
What's that?

41:18.313 --> 41:19.113
Mm.

41:22.612 --> 41:23.213
It's just a,

41:24.912 --> 41:26.679
it's a book on
astrology I found.

41:27.812 --> 41:28.979
Looking for a constellation,

41:29.013 --> 41:31.679
but can't find any
information on it, so.

41:31.712 --> 41:32.579
A constellation?

41:32.612 --> 41:33.645
Yeah.

41:34.645 --> 41:36.545
My mom won't shut up about it.

41:39.078 --> 41:41.779
She wouldn't, you know, she
wouldn't shut up about it.

41:46.645 --> 41:50.745
Our dead, they don't
really leave us.

41:53.711 --> 41:54.711
We're all connected.

41:57.178 --> 41:57.978
That too.

42:04.112 --> 42:07.911
Sorry if I'm being weird.

42:12.711 --> 42:14.611
You know, I think
growing up the way I did,

42:16.111 --> 42:18.845
I don't really get to do a
lot of normal things, so.

42:22.845 --> 42:23.644
Yeah.

42:26.644 --> 42:27.678
Yeah.

42:31.144 --> 42:34.578
This situation hasn't really

42:36.611 --> 42:38.810
afforded me the
easiest life either.

43:04.011 --> 43:05.577
Where are you from?

43:15.076 --> 43:18.577
Well, I'm from new
England originally,

43:20.676 --> 43:22.709
but then once Shae was
born and my dad left,

43:22.743 --> 43:25.776
then we just started
like moving around a lot.

43:28.743 --> 43:30.876
Out of sight, of course.

43:35.709 --> 43:36.743
My mom did a good job

43:38.576 --> 43:40.542
up until that witch
hunter got her.

44:11.275 --> 44:12.875
Idem.

44:18.608 --> 44:19.508
Wait, wait, wait.

44:19.541 --> 44:21.775
You guys have the wrong
backpacks on again.

44:21.808 --> 44:22.975
This is yours.

44:23.009 --> 44:24.908
I mean, it has
your names on them.

44:24.942 --> 44:26.109
It happens every time.

44:26.142 --> 44:30.308
- The same colors.
- It's the exact same.

44:30.341 --> 44:31.174
Okay.

44:32.575 --> 44:34.942
Sorry, let me get that.

44:35.808 --> 44:37.641
We're gonna be late.

44:38.641 --> 44:40.008
We're not gonna be late!

45:22.073 --> 45:23.173
Oh, Martha.

45:24.707 --> 45:26.940
I was just stepping
out for lunch.

45:26.973 --> 45:28.207
Did you need
something from inside?

45:28.240 --> 45:29.574
I can pop back in.

45:29.607 --> 45:31.107
Oh no.

45:31.140 --> 45:33.873
Emily, I was actually just
looking to speak with you.

45:35.773 --> 45:36.607
Oh.

45:43.207 --> 45:45.007
- Walk me to my car.
- Mm-hmm.

45:55.274 --> 45:56.207
Jacob, unfortunately,

45:56.240 --> 45:58.639
has not been into work
these past two days.

46:00.273 --> 46:02.206
I'm sure he's fine.

46:02.239 --> 46:04.539
Was that all?

46:04.573 --> 46:05.273
Yes.

46:05.307 --> 46:06.539
Okay.

46:25.705 --> 46:26.972
I got you.

46:27.006 --> 46:27.839
I got you.

46:29.172 --> 46:30.206
Tag.

46:30.240 --> 46:31.072
I got!

46:33.972 --> 46:35.039
Can I play?

46:40.206 --> 46:41.139
No.

46:41.172 --> 46:44.139
You can't play with us.

46:44.172 --> 46:45.839
I play with George.

46:45.872 --> 46:47.739
I play with Corey.

47:18.771 --> 47:20.771
Sorry, I was
finishing my essay.

47:24.804 --> 47:26.537
Where's Sofie and Megan?

47:26.571 --> 47:29.071
Late, per usual.

47:29.105 --> 47:30.105
Probably making out.

47:31.205 --> 47:32.138
ID please.

47:44.070 --> 47:45.970
Sorry, miss, can't let you in.

47:48.104 --> 47:49.305
What do you mean?

47:49.338 --> 47:51.070
I saw a movie here last
week and it was fine.

47:53.070 --> 47:54.037
New policy.

47:56.837 --> 47:57.937
Peyton, what the heck?

47:57.970 --> 47:58.870
Come on.

47:58.903 --> 48:01.205
Sorry, Kelly, I just can't.

48:01.238 --> 48:02.670
What do you mean, you can't?

48:04.205 --> 48:05.970
It's just a movie

48:06.004 --> 48:07.703
and I've wanted to see this
restoration for months.

48:07.737 --> 48:08.636
Come on.

48:08.670 --> 48:09.603
Kelly, I can't.

48:09.636 --> 48:11.070
Your name is on the list.

48:12.803 --> 48:13.636
What list?

48:16.237 --> 48:18.138
The BWI issued a new list.

48:19.104 --> 48:20.104
What?

48:20.137 --> 48:22.204
That list is for witches.

48:22.237 --> 48:23.137
- Did you forget your wallet?
- I'm not a witch.

48:23.170 --> 48:24.903
I've never done magic.

48:24.937 --> 48:26.036
My inhaler.

48:30.204 --> 48:32.670
You know I'm not a witch.

48:32.703 --> 48:34.036
And so I can't even see a movie?

48:50.969 --> 48:51.902
Did you see that?

49:04.602 --> 49:06.070
Hi.

49:06.103 --> 49:08.569
Sorry,
did I scare you?

49:08.602 --> 49:10.203
No, it's fine.

49:11.303 --> 49:12.103
What?

49:12.136 --> 49:13.169
What's this?

49:15.269 --> 49:16.901
Oh, it's nothing.

49:16.935 --> 49:18.669
I got it forever...

49:22.768 --> 49:23.602
What?

49:27.835 --> 49:32.035
I just wanted to tell you
I found the Southern Cross,

49:35.035 --> 49:37.901
the constellation I
was telling you about.

49:39.136 --> 49:41.002
Turn your light off.

49:58.801 --> 49:59.634
Look.

50:03.035 --> 50:07.001
Right above the wall
like straight ahead.

50:10.135 --> 50:11.934
What am I looking for exactly?

50:14.268 --> 50:16.600
Four stars
in the shape of a T.

50:22.700 --> 50:24.102
I don't see anything.

50:32.767 --> 50:35.633
Just to the right.

50:35.667 --> 50:38.734
Oh, it
looks like a cross.

50:40.035 --> 50:43.567
Mm-hmm, a Southern Cross.

50:47.101 --> 50:47.933
A Crux.

50:50.633 --> 50:51.267
Crux.

51:01.067 --> 51:02.833
Your mom said you
went to a movie.

51:07.067 --> 51:08.267
What was it like?

51:09.899 --> 51:12.234
It was a remaster
of "Thelma & Louise."

51:12.267 --> 51:13.201
What's that?

51:15.001 --> 51:17.101
You don't know what
"Thelma & Louise" is?

51:19.934 --> 51:21.200
I don't know if you know,

51:21.233 --> 51:24.599
I spent most of my
life in the dark.

51:26.766 --> 51:31.766
Well, Thelma is a
sheltered housewife.

51:35.898 --> 51:37.865
Louise is her best friend.

51:37.898 --> 51:39.898
She works as a
waitress at a diner.

51:42.666 --> 51:44.266
They go on this
really big road trip

51:45.166 --> 51:46.598
and they end up at a bar.

51:49.166 --> 51:50.765
You've been to a bar, right?

51:52.200 --> 51:53.033
No.

51:56.598 --> 51:57.531
No, you've never been,

51:57.565 --> 51:58.933
you've never been to a bar?

52:03.966 --> 52:05.033
So at this point,

52:05.066 --> 52:09.299
they can either go
back and go to jail

52:09.332 --> 52:11.565
or they could just keep driving.

52:11.598 --> 52:13.865
So basically, they just
end up driving the car

52:13.899 --> 52:15.265
off the cliff to the canyon.

52:16.732 --> 52:17.531
Yeah.

52:18.798 --> 52:19.999
And they die?

52:20.032 --> 52:20.832
Maybe.

52:22.199 --> 52:24.797
What do
you mean maybe?

52:24.831 --> 52:26.165
Well, maybe they
do, maybe they don't.

52:26.199 --> 52:27.898
The film kinds of
ends in a freeze frame

52:27.932 --> 52:29.999
of a car going over the cliff.

52:30.032 --> 52:31.932
Why?

52:31.965 --> 52:32.831
I don't know.

52:32.865 --> 52:35.530
Hope, maybe.

52:38.032 --> 52:40.132
But it's assumed
that they die?

52:41.597 --> 52:42.232
Maybe.

52:53.331 --> 52:56.999
Maybe they use magic
to fly off the cliff.

53:01.231 --> 53:02.131
That's why it was censored.

53:02.164 --> 53:03.764
Hence the freeze frame ending.

53:09.031 --> 53:11.763
I haven't I really
thought about it like that.

53:13.931 --> 53:14.897
They were witches.

53:25.831 --> 53:27.897
Have you ever
made anything fly?

53:37.864 --> 53:40.663
I told you, I don't have
the gene very strongly.

53:40.696 --> 53:41.529
Oh.

53:43.629 --> 53:44.263
Sorry.

54:33.962 --> 54:34.962
I'm sorry.

54:43.662 --> 54:44.829
You want to try?

54:52.996 --> 54:54.729
What?

54:54.762 --> 54:56.829
Do you want to try it?

55:01.895 --> 55:02.929
Just try it.

55:04.729 --> 55:05.561
Just try it.

55:06.895 --> 55:07.795
No one's watching.

55:13.996 --> 55:16.527
But I don't have the gene,
so I wouldn't be able...

55:17.195 --> 55:18.695
Forget about that.

55:19.328 --> 55:23.128
Focus on something
happy, something good.

55:35.161 --> 55:36.828
Don't over think it.

56:08.694 --> 56:09.828
Here, I got it...

56:59.926 --> 57:02.059
- Fiona...
- I'm sorry.

57:02.093 --> 57:02.993
What?

57:03.026 --> 57:04.792
I'm sorry.

57:04.826 --> 57:05.792
It's okay.

57:05.826 --> 57:06.892
No, it's not.

57:09.592 --> 57:12.759
I just want to be
like any other girl.

57:13.692 --> 57:16.126
But no, I'm not allowed that.

57:25.826 --> 57:29.993
Did you see the way
that they looked at me?

57:30.026 --> 57:31.692
How am I supposed
to control something

57:31.726 --> 57:34.659
that I'm not even
allowed to practice?

57:36.325 --> 57:37.859
And why does it have to be bad?

57:39.292 --> 57:41.925
I'm not bad.

57:41.958 --> 57:43.625
I'm not bad!

57:43.659 --> 57:44.958
I know.

57:44.992 --> 57:46.092
I'm so sorry.

58:10.224 --> 58:12.825
Corey, George, stop fighting!

58:12.858 --> 58:15.224
It's way too early for this!

58:18.992 --> 58:20.257
Good morning.

58:20.291 --> 58:23.157
- Sorry, hi.
- Hi, is your husband in?

58:24.825 --> 58:26.091
I don't have a husband.

58:27.558 --> 58:28.490
Oh, sorry.

58:31.890 --> 58:35.224
Eric Goude, I have here.

58:35.257 --> 58:36.191
Deceased.

58:38.824 --> 58:39.790
Deceased, okay.

58:42.623 --> 58:43.257
All right then.

58:44.857 --> 58:47.257
I own the property.

58:47.291 --> 58:48.224
How can I help you?

58:50.323 --> 58:51.924
My name is
Detective Hawthorne.

58:51.957 --> 58:53.790
I'm with the federal
branch of the BWI,

58:53.824 --> 58:55.657
- the Bureau of...
- Witchcraft Investigations,

58:55.690 --> 58:56.724
I'm familiar.

58:59.156 --> 59:01.790
I've been dispatched
to follow up on reports

59:01.824 --> 59:04.123
of suspicious
activity in your area.

59:05.790 --> 59:07.623
What kind of activity?

59:07.657 --> 59:09.690
A report of potential
witchcraft at a bar

59:09.724 --> 59:11.056
a few miles away from here.

59:11.090 --> 59:15.490
Oh, well, what
did she look like?

59:16.557 --> 59:18.223
The witch, in case I...

59:18.256 --> 59:22.956
Oh, late teens,
red hair, long.

59:24.990 --> 59:27.223
No, I haven't seen
anyone like that.

59:27.256 --> 59:28.856
- Excuse me.
- Sure.

59:34.556 --> 59:36.723
Your home is unusually low.

59:38.156 --> 59:39.689
Low?

59:39.723 --> 59:40.589
Low pressure.

59:42.556 --> 59:43.589
Oh.

59:45.090 --> 59:45.923
May I come in?

59:48.689 --> 59:49.522
Of course.

59:54.222 --> 59:57.589
My forebearers were
all witch hunters.

59:57.622 --> 59:58.822
I know, it's a terrible term.

59:58.855 --> 01:00:00.656
I hate it, it's like so archaic.

01:00:00.689 --> 01:00:02.089
But anyway, they were,

01:00:02.122 --> 01:00:04.055
and they used their ears, right?

01:00:04.089 --> 01:00:06.155
And people have said,
well, they have a sense,

01:00:06.189 --> 01:00:08.255
but actually, they
were using science.

01:00:08.289 --> 01:00:09.089
You see, they were actually,

01:00:09.122 --> 01:00:12.655
they could feel the
drop of pressure

01:00:12.688 --> 01:00:15.688
that occurs when magic is used

01:00:19.655 --> 01:00:22.922
or when a witch enacts
her powers, you know?

01:00:24.055 --> 01:00:26.288
Sir, or Detective Hawthorne,

01:00:26.321 --> 01:00:30.122
I assure you there
are no witches here.

01:00:30.154 --> 01:00:33.121
Oh, I'm sure there's
not, but magic lingers.

01:00:34.321 --> 01:00:37.555
It stays in these kind
of pressure pockets.

01:00:37.588 --> 01:00:39.655
You mind if I look around?

01:00:39.688 --> 01:00:41.054
That's fine.

01:00:41.088 --> 01:00:42.188
Please be brief.

01:00:42.221 --> 01:00:43.188
My kids are here.

01:00:43.221 --> 01:00:45.154
No, of course, I'll be brief.

01:00:45.188 --> 01:00:45.988
Okay.

01:01:14.320 --> 01:01:15.520
Hey!

01:01:17.854 --> 01:01:18.654
Mom.

01:01:19.754 --> 01:01:20.554
You okay?

01:01:23.321 --> 01:01:24.821
Detective?

01:01:24.854 --> 01:01:26.554
That's quite enough, this
is my daughter's room.

01:01:26.587 --> 01:01:27.554
I'm going to have
to ask you to leave.

01:01:27.587 --> 01:01:29.620
You do not have a warrant.

01:01:38.686 --> 01:01:39.520
Not yet.

01:02:35.652 --> 01:02:37.253
Tell me you weren't that stupid.

01:02:45.952 --> 01:02:47.218
For how long?

01:02:47.252 --> 01:02:48.252
Just for a little bit.

01:02:50.785 --> 01:02:51.819
Til things calm down.

01:03:08.784 --> 01:03:12.018
All girls
grades nine through 12

01:03:12.051 --> 01:03:14.219
report to the gymnasium
for prick testing.

01:03:15.918 --> 01:03:18.884
All girls grades nine through 12

01:03:18.918 --> 01:03:21.517
report to the gymnasium
for prick testing.

01:03:59.084 --> 01:04:00.117
You're free to go.

01:04:00.150 --> 01:04:01.218
No witch marks.

01:04:09.251 --> 01:04:10.084
Thank you.

01:04:13.850 --> 01:04:14.883
Here you go, girls.

01:04:22.850 --> 01:04:24.150
I know it's not ideal,

01:04:24.184 --> 01:04:26.049
but I think we should keep
you girls in the walls

01:04:26.083 --> 01:04:27.949
for a couple more
days to be safe.

01:04:39.217 --> 01:04:40.250
How was school today?

01:04:41.782 --> 01:04:43.250
Good.

01:04:43.284 --> 01:04:45.184
All the girls had testing,
so we got longer recess.

01:04:47.317 --> 01:04:48.949
Yeah, they prick tested us.

01:04:51.184 --> 01:04:54.083
I'm gonna need my most recent
sink test certification.

01:04:56.816 --> 01:04:58.150
- Come on, mom.
- Eat it.

01:05:00.016 --> 01:05:01.150
Stop.

01:05:01.184 --> 01:05:04.515
I have a copy of your sink
certificate in the drawer.

01:05:06.183 --> 01:05:08.183
Witches don't sink.

01:05:08.216 --> 01:05:09.816
Do you float?

01:05:09.849 --> 01:05:11.615
Stop it, Corey.

01:05:11.649 --> 01:05:13.849
You know very well those
tests are nonsense.

01:05:19.249 --> 01:05:21.249
Can you find a piece there?

01:05:21.283 --> 01:05:25.482
We just need that piece
and then we can beat it.

01:05:27.249 --> 01:05:30.948
I have a sword.

01:05:34.581 --> 01:05:36.216
Can't find like any pieces.

01:05:50.116 --> 01:05:50.948
Mom?

01:05:52.182 --> 01:05:53.015
Mom?

01:05:54.681 --> 01:05:57.581
Hey, it's just me.

01:05:58.681 --> 01:05:59.282
It's okay.

01:05:59.315 --> 01:06:01.248
I think mom blew a fuse.

01:06:03.148 --> 01:06:04.115
What you guys doing?

01:06:08.082 --> 01:06:09.115
Playing.

01:06:12.647 --> 01:06:15.780
You know, one of these days,

01:06:15.814 --> 01:06:17.914
I think you should let
Shae play with you.

01:06:19.182 --> 01:06:20.981
We are.

01:06:21.015 --> 01:06:22.148
Are you?

01:06:22.182 --> 01:06:23.981
Yeah, even though
she's a witch.

01:06:24.015 --> 01:06:25.048
George.

01:06:27.182 --> 01:06:28.547
Just try and be nice.

01:06:32.048 --> 01:06:33.048
Like mom says.

01:06:42.947 --> 01:06:44.580
- Goodnight, Corey.
- Goodnight, Claire.

01:06:44.613 --> 01:06:46.880
- Goodnight, George.
- Goodnight, Claire.

01:07:26.080 --> 01:07:29.180
I found
the Southern Cross.

01:09:47.710 --> 01:09:48.943
Claire, stop!

01:09:58.110 --> 01:10:01.210
Claire, Claire,
just step back.

01:10:01.243 --> 01:10:02.143
Step back.

01:10:02.177 --> 01:10:03.977
Step away from the edge, Claire.

01:10:06.943 --> 01:10:07.977
Oh my god.

01:10:10.110 --> 01:10:12.177
Claire.

01:10:12.210 --> 01:10:17.210
Honey, baby, stop!

01:10:19.276 --> 01:10:20.110
Claire!

01:10:21.742 --> 01:10:22.575
Claire!

01:10:25.608 --> 01:10:26.910
Please!

01:10:31.709 --> 01:10:35.876
- Claire, this is not real!
- Wake up, baby, wake up!

01:10:35.909 --> 01:10:38.909
- Claire!
- Wake up, wake up, baby!

01:10:43.109 --> 01:10:43.942
Claire!

01:10:50.942 --> 01:10:51.775
Girls.

01:10:53.641 --> 01:10:54.475
Girls.

01:10:56.176 --> 01:10:57.842
Are you okay?

01:10:57.875 --> 01:10:58.942
Are you okay?

01:11:09.208 --> 01:11:11.241
Inside, inside.

01:11:11.275 --> 01:11:12.909
Okay, baby, come on.

01:11:13.842 --> 01:11:14.842
Inside.

01:11:44.308 --> 01:11:45.874
- Martha, please.
- I'm sorry.

01:11:45.908 --> 01:11:46.808
- Please.
- I'm sorry.

01:11:46.841 --> 01:11:47.908
I have to keep you safe.

01:11:47.941 --> 01:11:48.841
I'm sorry.

01:11:48.874 --> 01:11:50.008
Inside please, I'm sorry.

01:11:58.841 --> 01:12:02.107
Mom, we can't just
keep them in the walls.

01:12:02.140 --> 01:12:03.841
We should move them to the barn.

01:12:03.874 --> 01:12:07.274
We can and we will.

01:12:07.307 --> 01:12:11.074
But first, we have to figure
out what Cynthia saw or did.

01:12:11.107 --> 01:12:13.773
So you go to school like normal,

01:12:13.807 --> 01:12:17.873
the boys stay with me, and
the girls stay in the wall.

01:12:26.605 --> 01:12:27.539
Claire, Claire!

01:12:28.274 --> 01:12:29.572
Come on, we're gonna miss it.

01:12:29.605 --> 01:12:30.907
- Miss what?
- Come on, come on.

01:12:35.873 --> 01:12:36.940
What's going on?

01:12:36.974 --> 01:12:38.505
They're making the four
girls with witches marks

01:12:38.539 --> 01:12:39.707
do the sink test again.

01:12:39.740 --> 01:12:40.773
What?

01:13:04.239 --> 01:13:05.706
Here we go.

01:13:05.739 --> 01:13:08.571
I'm so glad we don't
have to do this again.

01:13:08.605 --> 01:13:09.706
Barely remember mine.

01:13:09.739 --> 01:13:14.739
I almost passed out,
I was so nervous.

01:13:37.806 --> 01:13:40.005
This
test is so boring.

01:13:40.038 --> 01:13:41.272
No one ever floats.

01:13:41.305 --> 01:13:43.205
Not that you've seen.

01:13:43.238 --> 01:13:44.672
My sister said that
in New Hampshire,

01:13:44.706 --> 01:13:47.805
an entire grade of girls
floated to the top.

01:13:47.838 --> 01:13:49.172
Got sent to the
camp on the spot.

01:13:49.205 --> 01:13:51.671
Well, your sister is
a pathological liar.

01:14:20.771 --> 01:14:22.104
Time!

01:14:22.137 --> 01:14:23.237
Pull 'em out.

01:14:31.971 --> 01:14:33.804
Reel 'em up, let's go.

01:14:43.171 --> 01:14:45.837
Well, that was a bust.

01:15:23.703 --> 01:15:25.136
Holy shit.

01:15:28.836 --> 01:15:31.070
I cannot believe
that just happened.

01:15:31.103 --> 01:15:33.703
Yeah, that was Amy Schoeler.

01:15:33.736 --> 01:15:35.536
She gets like panic attacks.

01:15:35.569 --> 01:15:37.669
She probably freaked
out under there.

01:15:37.703 --> 01:15:39.703
Then why would she
submit to the test?

01:15:42.736 --> 01:15:44.070
Can't she be medically examined?

01:15:44.103 --> 01:15:45.502
Yeah, but I mean,

01:15:45.536 --> 01:15:46.669
it doesn't make
you look so good.

01:15:46.703 --> 01:15:48.569
Yeah, fast tracks
you to a camp,

01:15:48.602 --> 01:15:49.803
which she probably would
ended up in anyway.

01:15:49.836 --> 01:15:52.235
She was so strange.

01:15:52.269 --> 01:15:55.102
Jen, a girl just fucking died.

01:15:58.835 --> 01:16:02.802
Yeah, but, she chose to.

01:16:02.835 --> 01:16:03.669
Did she?

01:16:11.702 --> 01:16:12.535
Forget it.

01:16:47.901 --> 01:16:48.734
Mom?

01:17:29.600 --> 01:17:30.634
Mom?

01:17:36.700 --> 01:17:37.900
Corey, George?

01:17:42.233 --> 01:17:43.067
Fiona?

01:17:44.700 --> 01:17:46.599
Fiona, Shae?

01:17:48.533 --> 01:17:51.666
Claire?

01:17:51.700 --> 01:17:52.533
Corey.

01:17:56.100 --> 01:17:56.933
Corey?

01:18:08.999 --> 01:18:10.166
What the heck?

01:18:21.266 --> 01:18:22.099
Shae.

01:18:23.832 --> 01:18:24.632
Shae.

01:18:24.665 --> 01:18:26.266
You're just like them.

01:18:26.300 --> 01:18:27.533
You're right, Shae.

01:18:29.099 --> 01:18:30.732
She is just like all of them.

01:18:30.765 --> 01:18:33.598
Fiona, Fiona, what's going on?

01:18:35.066 --> 01:18:36.865
Where's my mom,
where are the twins?

01:18:36.899 --> 01:18:38.832
He took them in
for questioning.

01:18:38.865 --> 01:18:40.132
Who?

01:18:40.166 --> 01:18:41.699
That witch hunter, Hawthorne.

01:18:42.999 --> 01:18:44.498
They didn't get you?

01:18:44.532 --> 01:18:45.799
We were in the barn.

01:18:45.832 --> 01:18:47.532
I came up here to
get the butterfly

01:18:47.565 --> 01:18:49.565
so that no one would
find magic in your room

01:18:49.598 --> 01:18:54.565
and found this.

01:18:54.598 --> 01:18:57.266
That was just an
assignment for school.

01:18:57.299 --> 01:19:00.098
Yeah, one that you
chose to write about.

01:19:00.131 --> 01:19:01.231
According to you,

01:19:03.765 --> 01:19:06.098
children of convicted witches

01:19:06.931 --> 01:19:11.065
should be closely monitored
due to their genetic link

01:19:11.098 --> 01:19:13.131
to the ability to
practice witchcraft.

01:19:13.165 --> 01:19:14.266
I don't believe
in any of that.

01:19:14.299 --> 01:19:16.864
- I wrote that report...
- Bullshit!

01:19:19.564 --> 01:19:20.531
I'm a person.

01:19:22.131 --> 01:19:23.631
I'm a person just like you.

01:19:31.231 --> 01:19:32.464
He's back.

01:19:49.863 --> 01:19:52.198
You guys, inside.

01:19:56.198 --> 01:19:57.997
Hello, Claire.

01:19:58.030 --> 01:19:58.997
I must apologize to you

01:19:59.030 --> 01:20:01.797
for the way my officers
have treated your home,

01:20:03.298 --> 01:20:05.530
but you can't be too
careful, can you?

01:20:05.563 --> 01:20:07.930
Especially after such
a fantastical account

01:20:07.964 --> 01:20:08.863
by your neighbor.

01:20:11.231 --> 01:20:14.064
Well, we need to start
cleaning this place up.

01:20:18.563 --> 01:20:20.030
Again, my apologies,

01:20:22.230 --> 01:20:27.230
but this is my job to stop
hysteria and uphold the law.

01:20:32.197 --> 01:20:33.896
It's him.

01:20:33.929 --> 01:20:35.096
He killed mom.

01:20:37.996 --> 01:20:41.496
You guys had nothing to hide.

01:20:57.862 --> 01:20:58.696
Or do you?

01:21:10.762 --> 01:21:11.862
Always witches.

01:21:15.762 --> 01:21:16.729
Detective?

01:21:21.928 --> 01:21:22.761
It's not you.

01:21:27.028 --> 01:21:28.229
Stay behind me.

01:21:28.263 --> 01:21:32.895
And it's not the
boys, of course,

01:21:33.695 --> 01:21:35.995
which means it's you.

01:21:48.262 --> 01:21:49.594
Claire,
get over here.

01:21:49.628 --> 01:21:50.995
- Claire.
- Don't do this.

01:21:51.761 --> 01:21:54.528
I've been doing this
for a long time, Claire.

01:21:55.695 --> 01:21:56.962
So then you should know

01:21:59.195 --> 01:22:01.162
that being a witch
is not a crime.

01:22:03.894 --> 01:22:06.228
And that all magic is not bad.

01:22:06.262 --> 01:22:08.128
There's good magic too.

01:22:08.162 --> 01:22:12.660
Yes, but the act of
witchcraft is a crime, Claire.

01:22:16.228 --> 01:22:18.527
You're a government official.

01:22:18.560 --> 01:22:19.760
Claire.

01:22:19.794 --> 01:22:21.195
You're just gonna shoot us?

01:22:22.860 --> 01:22:24.228
I'm gonna count to five,

01:22:24.961 --> 01:22:28.195
and at the end, I'm
gonna pull the trigger.

01:22:31.195 --> 01:22:36.194
All you gotta do is one little
act of witchcraft, okay?

01:22:37.227 --> 01:22:38.127
Empty the chamber,

01:22:38.161 --> 01:22:39.094
knock the gun out of my hand,

01:22:39.127 --> 01:22:39.927
push me back.

01:22:39.961 --> 01:22:40.794
I don't care what it is.

01:22:46.194 --> 01:22:47.627
And if I don't?

01:22:54.560 --> 01:22:55.194
Five.

01:22:57.227 --> 01:22:58.460
Four.

01:23:00.859 --> 01:23:01.693
Three.

01:23:05.194 --> 01:23:06.227
Two.

01:23:11.859 --> 01:23:13.194
One.

01:23:16.893 --> 01:23:22.061
Go, go, go, go, go!

01:23:23.094 --> 01:23:26.626
- You are staying with me.
- Unlock this door.

01:23:26.659 --> 01:23:27.492
Claire!

01:23:28.559 --> 01:23:29.193
Sit.

01:23:30.759 --> 01:23:33.459
They ran up the
stairs, the witch.

01:23:35.659 --> 01:23:36.559
Where is it?!

01:24:49.992 --> 01:24:51.159
Fiona, Shae?

01:25:04.058 --> 01:25:04.891
Fiona!

01:25:08.258 --> 01:25:09.091
Shae!

01:25:42.058 --> 01:25:44.123
Shae, Shae.

01:25:44.157 --> 01:25:45.756
Shae, Shae, Shae, Shae.

01:25:45.790 --> 01:25:47.090
I need you to breathe.

01:26:07.257 --> 01:26:09.157
- Claire, just go!
- No!

01:26:24.023 --> 01:26:25.522
Claire, come on.

01:26:26.588 --> 01:26:29.222
Okay, do you have your inhaler?

01:26:29.256 --> 01:26:31.722
Okay, darling, okay.

01:26:33.790 --> 01:26:35.089
Okay, hey.

01:26:42.256 --> 01:26:43.089
Okay.

01:26:43.122 --> 01:26:44.689
Breathe.

01:26:44.721 --> 01:26:45.956
Okay, okay, okay.

01:28:31.619 --> 01:28:35.552
Fiona, could you watch
the kids for a minute?

01:28:35.585 --> 01:28:37.653
I need to talk to Claire.

01:28:40.687 --> 01:28:41.519
Claire?

01:28:51.720 --> 01:28:52.753
Claire, I'm sorry.

01:28:52.787 --> 01:28:53.886
I'd hoped that it
would skip you.

01:28:53.919 --> 01:28:54.986
You've known this whole time.

01:28:55.019 --> 01:28:56.086
No.

01:28:56.119 --> 01:28:57.186
Your father's side.

01:28:59.585 --> 01:29:01.585
I thought it was a possibility.

01:29:15.919 --> 01:29:18.852
When your dad passed away,

01:29:18.886 --> 01:29:21.819
I moved us here to be
part of something bigger,

01:29:21.852 --> 01:29:25.986
but also so that you could cross
over if you ever needed to.

01:29:27.852 --> 01:29:31.185
I thought that I could
keep you safe and I can't.

01:29:35.652 --> 01:29:38.218
Your dad's family, they're kind,

01:29:41.985 --> 01:29:46.985
and they're good, and they
are extraordinarily gifted,

01:29:48.085 --> 01:29:49.018
just like you.

01:29:52.751 --> 01:29:55.052
They live south of the border.

01:29:55.985 --> 01:29:57.751
I'm sorry I kept them from you.

01:30:03.185 --> 01:30:08.185
They'll be so happy
to see you, but I...

01:30:11.584 --> 01:30:12.584
You're not coming?

01:30:18.517 --> 01:30:19.151
I can't.

01:30:22.718 --> 01:30:24.884
Only witches can cross.

01:31:37.183 --> 01:31:38.616
- Ready?
- Yeah.

01:32:41.493 --> 01:32:43.727
