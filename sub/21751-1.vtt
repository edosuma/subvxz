- Go.</i>

03:02.349 --> 03:04.309
<i>Mom! Who are they?</i>

03:04.476 --> 03:07.687
<i>I don't have time to explain it
to you now. You have to go.</i>

03:07.937 --> 03:08.988
<i>Quick!</i>

03:12.400 --> 03:14.110
<i>Mom will come after you.</i>

03:15.445 --> 03:17.113
- Mama
<i>- Go. You have to go.</i>

03:18.698 --> 03:19.741
<i>Anybody here?</i>

03:26.498 --> 03:27.749
<i>Would you mind?</i>

03:27.916 --> 03:28.958
<i>For sure.</i>

04:02.992 --> 04:04.494
<i>- Is everything ready?
- Yes.</i>

04:04.661 --> 04:06.496
<i>- Did you have any problems?
- No.</i>

<i>SARAJEVO, 1995</i>

04:53.593 --> 04:55.900
<i>Hello. Your documents.</i>

04:59.891 --> 05:01.864
<i>Out!</i>

05:01.976 --> 05:04.158
<i>Out! Out!</i>

05:05.438 --> 05:07.953
Hands above your head! Move!

05:11.027 --> 05:13.000
Your hand!

05:16.824 --> 05:19.298
- Hey, take it easy!
- Clothes off.

05:19.368 --> 05:21.453
- Like a start.
- We've had worse.

05:21.454 --> 05:23.427
Now!

05:29.962 --> 05:32.728
Yeah I, I probably should have worn
a different underwear huh?

05:42.600 --> 05:44.323
Get dressed.

05:44.936 --> 05:48.605
Future access to the general will depend
on your handling of this interview.

05:48.606 --> 05:51.566
We expect his words to
be heard unedited.

05:51.567 --> 05:55.028
The world must see this a man
of humanity and integrity.

05:55.029 --> 05:58.420
We are here to report what
he has to say. Word for word.

06:30.106 --> 06:32.997
- Shit!
- What's the odd, JP?

06:33.067 --> 06:36.361
These things always get wet.
Let's go old school.

06:36.362 --> 06:38.502
Go on, we gotta move.

07:01.012 --> 07:03.388
All right, general, could I just
get your sound level please?

07:03.389 --> 07:05.348
Just speak normally.

07:05.349 --> 07:09.283
<i>I might have you all skinned alive
once all of this is done.</i>

07:09.645 --> 07:10.937
Sounds good to me.

07:10.938 --> 07:14.789
- Hear what he just said?
- Loud and clear, it is gonna be fun.

07:18.196 --> 07:20.030
Clear right.

07:20.031 --> 07:22.087
Clear left.

07:23.493 --> 07:25.466
Right here.

07:27.788 --> 07:29.539
General Milic,

07:29.540 --> 07:32.000
how do you respond to the
international community,

07:32.001 --> 07:34.961
who say that your troops have
committed these untold atrocities?

07:34.962 --> 07:36.463
Simply.
Very simply.

07:36.464 --> 07:39.424
The people of the world
had been fed lies..

07:39.425 --> 07:43.011
They fail to understand the consequences
of Croatia's separation...

07:43.012 --> 07:46.070
I am sorry, uh... General.
We lost sound.

07:46.432 --> 07:50.157
If I may, I just need to
Uh.. Change up the battery.

07:50.311 --> 07:53.452
Sorry.
Won't take too long.

07:54.315 --> 07:57.248
Okay, great, okay.

07:58.110 --> 08:00.153
How's that?

08:00.154 --> 08:02.336
Good to go.

08:15.795 --> 08:19.464
Stand by.
Three, two, one, execute!

08:19.465 --> 08:21.355
Corning steel!

08:57.712 --> 09:00.088
- How was interview, boys?
- Pretty boring.

09:00.089 --> 09:02.396
Yeah the sound was great!

09:07.513 --> 09:09.403
Let's go.

09:18.274 --> 09:21.248
Shit!
Down, down.

09:21.903 --> 09:27.004
Alright, we got a Serb boat out there.
Three, two, one, go!

09:41.255 --> 09:43.798
All right, get the general.
Get the bags.

09:43.799 --> 09:46.524
Stanton, clear those stairs for us.

09:50.848 --> 09:52.988
Stairs clear.

09:54.644 --> 09:56.826
Contact left!

09:58.815 --> 10:00.996
Stanton, get up here!

10:03.736 --> 10:05.876
RPG!

10:06.072 --> 10:08.003
Stanton!

10:18.751 --> 10:20.933
Last man!

10:39.897 --> 10:42.204
You sure?

10:43.401 --> 10:45.291
Always.

10:53.661 --> 10:57.761
- Where did you learn to drive a tank?
- Ah, it's first time, how am I doing?

11:02.211 --> 11:05.255
2-2 SAS, this is Formula 150.

11:05.256 --> 11:06.937
Copy?

11:11.721 --> 11:14.028
2-2 SAS, do you read?

11:14.891 --> 11:17.809
<i>- Yes, Formula 150, we read.</i>
- Finally!

11:17.810 --> 11:20.701
So, we have got the package.
We're moving due east.

11:21.397 --> 11:23.482
Modify Exfil plan.

11:23.483 --> 11:26.776
<i>What do you think, Formula 150?
We will have to check with command. Over.</i>

11:26.777 --> 11:30.363
- JP, did you ever shot one of those?
- You got a trigger, I can shoot it.

11:30.364 --> 11:32.254
Use the trigger.

11:33.659 --> 11:37.009
Here we go!
Round one, ready a sec!

11:37.747 --> 11:39.637
RPG!

11:43.419 --> 11:45.559
Shoot! Shoot!

11:47.882 --> 11:50.981
Shit, diesel reserves.
The aim's too high.

11:53.513 --> 11:56.237
- Hit him, JP!
- Got it. I got it.

11:58.643 --> 12:00.783
Fuel for the fire.

12:04.899 --> 12:07.206
I think you hit 'em.

12:17.161 --> 12:19.955
2-2 SAS!
What's the new extraction point?

12:19.956 --> 12:23.931
<i>Hold on, 150.
Still waiting on command for authorization.</i>

12:24.961 --> 12:27.143
Alright, we got company.

12:27.880 --> 12:29.840
Authorize yourself to
land that chopper,

12:29.841 --> 12:32.148
we need it. Now!

12:34.303 --> 12:36.026
Grenade!

12:41.352 --> 12:44.354
<i>Negative, 150.
You are now in unsupported airspace.</i>

12:44.355 --> 12:45.772
<i>- Stick to the plan.</i>
- What?

12:45.773 --> 12:48.080
I ain't got time for this shit!

12:50.027 --> 12:53.669
- So where are we going?
- We're taking the scenic route.

12:58.661 --> 13:00.593
Incoming!

13:13.384 --> 13:15.969
- JP, you see the comms tower?
- Yeah.

13:15.970 --> 13:17.943
Bring it down!

13:24.520 --> 13:27.661
Go! Go! Go!
Got him, got him!

13:32.778 --> 13:34.919
Yes! Yes!

13:35.406 --> 13:37.546
All clear.

13:54.800 --> 13:57.358
Boys, I got a tank in front of us.

14:02.058 --> 14:04.365
I got one behind this too.

14:05.728 --> 14:07.868
Petrovic.

14:09.440 --> 14:11.622
- JP?
- Chief?

14:12.109 --> 14:14.236
Turn the gun at ten o'clock.

14:14.237 --> 14:16.919
- Hit it.
- Copy that.

14:28.793 --> 14:31.267
We're going for a swim, boys.

14:40.346 --> 14:43.821
- There you go.
- Shoot them!

14:57.613 --> 15:00.240
So, when do you wanna go?

15:00.241 --> 15:02.423
When it stops raining.

15:28.603 --> 15:32.787
<i>Alert the patrol boat.
I want you to stop them.</i>

16:16.150 --> 16:19.069
<i>Formula 150, we have clearance
for the alternative extraction.</i>

16:19.070 --> 16:22.489
<i>- Formula 150, we have clearance...</i>
- Chief?

16:22.490 --> 16:26.701
<i>I repeat, we now have clearance
for alternative extraction, over.</i>

16:26.702 --> 16:28.787
Are you kidding me?

16:28.788 --> 16:31.178
You're little late, boys.

16:38.506 --> 16:41.605
FORWARD OPERATING BASE,
BOSNIA-HERZEGOVINA

17:16.627 --> 17:20.728
Do you have any idea the
shit storm you've created.

17:20.964 --> 17:24.315
The people I have had to explain this to.

17:24.594 --> 17:27.220
- I believe I do, Sir.
- Who asked you?

17:27.221 --> 17:29.264
And no, you do not, Barnes!

17:29.265 --> 17:31.349
Because you don't have two
ounces of gray matter

17:31.350 --> 17:35.103
bouncing around inside that
hollow metal on top of your shoulder.

17:35.104 --> 17:36.827
Okay, sir.

17:36.898 --> 17:39.232
Your orders, were to get in,

17:39.233 --> 17:42.736
secure the package, deliver
it without a footprint,

17:42.737 --> 17:44.919
like we were never there!

17:45.198 --> 17:46.823
And what we get?

17:46.824 --> 17:51.286
A soviet era tank running roughshod
over half the goddamn city of Sarajevo,

17:51.287 --> 17:53.747
Dead Serbs in its wake.

17:53.748 --> 17:57.250
And a highly uncomfortable conversation
between myself...

17:57.251 --> 18:00.337
and the Under Secretary of the
Joint Chief of staff.

18:00.338 --> 18:02.255
Sir, we were compromised.

18:02.256 --> 18:05.592
So, in order to protect my team and
complete the op, we had to adapt.

18:05.593 --> 18:10.444
And you thought driving a goddamn tank
over half of Sarajevo was the answer?

18:10.723 --> 18:12.613
Yes, sir, I did.

18:13.059 --> 18:15.407
You're all on leave.

18:15.686 --> 18:17.535
Three days.

18:17.605 --> 18:21.191
During which time command will decide
whether to flay your asses in public,

18:21.192 --> 18:23.443
for all the world to see,

18:23.444 --> 18:25.904
or maybe just do it here,
privately,

18:25.905 --> 18:28.462
so only we get to enjoy it.

18:29.617 --> 18:31.715
Dismissed.

18:32.036 --> 18:34.009
Wait.

18:36.040 --> 18:38.222
Almost forgot.

18:41.754 --> 18:43.894
There's four more.

18:44.340 --> 18:49.900
FYI, I will be having quite the
turse conversation with 22 SAS.

18:50.888 --> 18:53.654
Enjoy that with utmost discretion.

18:53.975 --> 18:56.115
Dismissed.

18:57.854 --> 18:59.535
Goddamn tank!

19:00.565 --> 19:02.274
Anyone for another drink?

19:02.275 --> 19:05.458
Cause I...
Buy it.

19:06.487 --> 19:09.156
Well, this round's on me.
Cause I wanna say something.

19:09.157 --> 19:12.798
You are not gonna hear a word I'm saying.
Cause I can't hear myself.

19:12.827 --> 19:14.842
Boys!

19:15.413 --> 19:17.887
Shut up!
Now you shut up?

19:17.999 --> 19:20.764
JP, privacy.

19:28.509 --> 19:31.052
After that trick,
I got to say...

19:31.053 --> 19:33.763
Boys, here is to the
success of that mission.

19:33.764 --> 19:36.224
And here's to the success
of many more.

19:36.225 --> 19:38.300
I couldn't ask for more
from any of you boys.

19:38.350 --> 19:39.508
To The team!

19:39.520 --> 19:41.730
Gentlemen, start your livers.

19:41.731 --> 19:43.746
Already done.

19:46.527 --> 19:49.001
Oh, oh, Nine o' clock,
nine o' clock.

19:49.530 --> 19:51.198
Gorgeous!

19:51.199 --> 19:52.908
Ah... Lara!

19:52.909 --> 19:54.576
Lara, Lara, Lara!

19:54.577 --> 19:58.914
I got a question for you, Lara.
Of all the guys sitting here,

19:58.915 --> 20:02.473
and I am including myself in these...
degenerates.

20:02.835 --> 20:07.853
Which one of us seems most
likely to succeed... with you?

20:10.301 --> 20:13.025
How do you say "not you"?

20:16.182 --> 20:18.892
- Shot down.
- Ice cold!

20:18.893 --> 20:22.451
And how do I say "she's perfect"?

20:23.022 --> 20:25.732
There you go, guys.
This one is on me.

20:25.733 --> 20:29.319
Hey Peter, listen, your waitress, Lara.
What's the deal with her?

20:29.320 --> 20:30.737
She's beautiful, no?

20:30.738 --> 20:34.533
Yes, she is beautiful, but she's
unreceptive to my charms.

20:34.534 --> 20:38.411
Well, she's real deal.
A local girl with morals.

20:38.412 --> 20:41.887
Oh, morals. Well, that will put
her way out of your league.

20:43.501 --> 20:46.753
And now I wanna know, why you are
laughing. Cause you're not even trying.

20:46.754 --> 20:49.311
Ben, that's because I don't try.

20:49.340 --> 20:51.647
You should try it.

20:55.805 --> 20:58.807
Which way are we going?
Getting a kebab?

20:58.808 --> 21:01.532
- No, I'm full.
- Really?

21:01.769 --> 21:04.076
Yeah, I might take a walk.

21:06.524 --> 21:10.666
Keep your eye out for Petrovich's guys.
He is sore a loser.

21:14.448 --> 21:16.589
See you bud.

21:35.970 --> 21:38.527
My most likely to succeed.

22:01.204 --> 22:03.511
Is my man hungry?

22:03.623 --> 22:06.806
No, your man is
happy right where he is.

22:09.504 --> 22:11.644
I've been thinking...

22:12.256 --> 22:16.023
I want you to come home
with me when we are done here.

22:18.471 --> 22:21.014
Why do you want me to
bring me to your home?

22:21.015 --> 22:23.155
Because I love you.

22:24.352 --> 22:27.868
And because...
You've changed me.

22:28.648 --> 22:30.955
My future is here.

22:32.068 --> 22:35.362
- I can not leave my country.
- Now, Lara, it's a mess out there.

22:35.363 --> 22:38.114
Would you run away these terrible things
were happening in Bakers town?

22:38.115 --> 22:40.422
Bakersfield.

22:43.788 --> 22:46.929
No. No, I wouldn't.

22:51.295 --> 22:54.395
Some weeks ago I
started a foundation.

22:54.632 --> 22:57.273
And yesterday, I got official papers.

22:58.719 --> 23:01.861
Now I can raise money
for what my country needs.

23:02.014 --> 23:04.266
It's an opportunity.

23:04.267 --> 23:07.032
- You want to know the name?
- Sure.

23:07.103 --> 23:09.062
It's the Lara Civic Foundation

23:09.063 --> 23:12.788
for rebuilt and better Bosnia Herzegovina.

23:13.359 --> 23:15.791
That's a long title.

23:18.573 --> 23:21.213
- I deserved that.
- Hmm, you do.

23:21.784 --> 23:24.091
You really are soft.

23:24.495 --> 23:26.288
Yes, I am.

23:26.289 --> 23:28.387
<i>Cowboy.</i>

23:37.925 --> 23:40.468
<i>- What is this?
- Smells good.</i>

23:40.469 --> 23:42.610
<i>Get out now.</i>

23:42.847 --> 23:44.681
<i>Yes, we will be leaving.</i>

23:44.682 --> 23:46.217
<i>As soon as you give us the bar.</i>

23:46.417 --> 23:48.894
<i>Give it up, Lara.
I will not ask for it again.</i>

23:48.895 --> 23:51.813
<i>You went too far Milenko.
Bringing these animals into my house.</i>

23:51.814 --> 23:54.497
<i>- Give it to us or we'll find it!
- Go to hell!</i>

23:55.067 --> 23:57.583
<i>Get out! Out!</i>

23:59.822 --> 24:01.740
Hey... What's going on here?

24:01.741 --> 24:04.659
Don't mess with us, American.
We don't fight nice here.

24:04.660 --> 24:07.384
That's okay.
Neither do I.

24:07.914 --> 24:09.664
Friends?

24:09.665 --> 24:11.847
<i>Look at this fool...</i>

24:19.926 --> 24:22.093
Now she gives us
what we came for,

24:22.094 --> 24:24.471
or your brain makes a pretty
picture right here on the floor.

24:24.472 --> 24:26.765
- Don't say anything, Lara.
- It's not here.

24:26.766 --> 24:29.476
<i>I'll show you where it is.
Just don't hurt him.</i>

24:29.477 --> 24:31.408
<i>He knows nothing about it.</i>

24:31.604 --> 24:33.786
<i>That's my girl.</i>

24:59.048 --> 25:01.800
Told you you should have gone
get a kebab.

25:01.801 --> 25:04.150
They are really good.

25:05.513 --> 25:07.570
This one is mine.

25:07.974 --> 25:11.490
- How long have you known?
- What? About you two?

25:12.812 --> 25:14.604
All time.

25:14.605 --> 25:16.912
You have not been very subtle.

25:21.154 --> 25:23.252
So, Lara...

25:24.240 --> 25:29.008
Who are these guys?
Well, this one is my brother.

25:29.078 --> 25:31.385
The other ones I don't know.

25:32.081 --> 25:34.096
Well...

25:37.378 --> 25:41.103
You... Might wanna start
using this head.

25:41.424 --> 25:43.967
Trying to work out
what that's all about.

25:43.968 --> 25:46.150
Huh?

26:01.402 --> 26:03.918
.999 percent pure.

26:03.946 --> 26:06.420
12.4 Kilograms.

26:06.491 --> 26:10.660
Worth about 150,000
in your American dollars.

26:10.661 --> 26:12.593
Jesus!

26:12.705 --> 26:16.055
- Where did you get this?
- It's a long story.

26:16.167 --> 26:19.725
From... A long time ago.

29:25.857 --> 29:28.233
<i>It is my grandfather's story.</i>

29:28.234 --> 29:31.000
<i>One that hunted him most of his life.</i>

29:32.905 --> 29:34.837
<i>Anybody here?</i>

29:55.178 --> 29:57.971
<i>He did everything he could
to fight trouble.</i>

29:57.972 --> 30:01.614
<i>And when he couldn't find it,
trouble found him.</i>

30:38.346 --> 30:40.861
<i>Drop it, please.</i>

30:41.390 --> 30:45.324
<i>Get that rascal,
he's got my gold!</i>

31:13.589 --> 31:15.521
<i>Fire!</i>

31:27.019 --> 31:31.954
<i>Calm down, calm down!
I will help you.</i>

31:32.483 --> 31:35.902
<i>No! I'm not a Nazi!
Just calm down... Come on.</i>

31:35.903 --> 31:39.378
<i>Come, come.
I'm your friend.</i>

31:39.866 --> 31:42.909
<i>Will you trust me?
Would you come with me?</i>

31:42.910 --> 31:45.968
<i>Come on.
Let's go. You first.</i>

31:50.042 --> 31:51.668
<i>- Everything is ready?
- All ready.</i>

31:51.669 --> 31:53.795
<i>- Did you have any problems?
- No.</i>

31:53.796 --> 31:55.561
<i>Here.</i>

32:07.894 --> 32:09.742
<i>Come.</i>

32:15.571 --> 32:17.350
<i>Hit it.</i>

33:02.198 --> 33:04.880
<i>It was as if GRAHOVO
never existed.</i>

33:05.201 --> 33:07.675
<i>In time it was forgotten.</i>

33:07.954 --> 33:09.996
<i>But my grandfather...</i>

33:09.997 --> 33:12.304
<i>he never forgot.</i>

33:28.641 --> 33:32.700
<i>CASA ROBLES, Vault & Safe,
Lorca SPAIN, CR 100007</i>

33:33.437 --> 33:35.953
People of my
town laughed at him.

33:36.107 --> 33:39.832
They said that he was just a crazy
old man telling made up stories.

33:40.570 --> 33:44.503
But to me there was always something
different about this story.

33:45.658 --> 33:47.965
There was pain in it.

33:48.035 --> 33:50.912
A sadness he held inside him
the rest of his life.

33:50.913 --> 33:52.789
And the gold bar?

33:52.790 --> 33:55.764
It was exactly where he
told me it would be.

33:56.085 --> 33:58.642
At the base of that statue.

34:00.298 --> 34:04.023
Can you imagine what that gold
could do to help my people?

34:06.387 --> 34:08.694
Will you help me get it?

34:13.393 --> 34:15.353
You are saying that
this is Nazi gold?

34:15.353 --> 34:17.772
French gold, stolen by the Nazis.

34:17.773 --> 34:21.873
And there's more these at the bottom of
this lake? And nobody knows it's there?

34:22.235 --> 34:24.737
- How many of these are down there?
- Trucks full.

34:24.739 --> 34:27.324
Two thousand bars, maybe more.

34:27.324 --> 34:30.243
- How much, Ben?
- This is about 150,000 dollars.

34:30.244 --> 34:33.928
Times 2 thousand bars,
300 million dollars.

34:34.956 --> 34:38.960
- You realize what we're talking about here?
- Recovering more than 300 million dollars

34:38.960 --> 34:41.420
in gold bars that nobody
seen in 50 years.

34:41.422 --> 34:43.380
Yeah.

34:43.382 --> 34:47.636
Under 150 feet of water.
Right in the middle of enemy territory.

34:47.637 --> 34:51.445
Not to mention the logistics
for an operation like that.

34:51.641 --> 34:54.156
How did you even
find out about this?

34:57.021 --> 34:59.161
<i>- Hello Love.
- Honey.</i>

35:03.069 --> 35:05.320
You remember Lara, right?

35:05.321 --> 35:07.447
- The other night.
- From the bar.

35:07.448 --> 35:09.755
I remember what happened.

35:10.326 --> 35:12.174
Who wants wine?

35:12.995 --> 35:17.263
These villages here...
Wiped out. Gone.

35:17.834 --> 35:20.669
Those who managed to escape
live worse than animals.

35:20.670 --> 35:23.672
Scraps of food, contaminated
water, no medical help...

35:23.673 --> 35:26.049
My lady, that's
why NATO is here.

35:26.050 --> 35:28.260
- Put an end to all that.
- What happens when we all leave?

35:28.261 --> 35:30.095
They will have to
rebuild their lives again.

35:30.096 --> 35:33.723
That gold... It can build
schools, hospitals, roads.

35:33.724 --> 35:36.393
It will change the lives of
people who have no future.

35:36.394 --> 35:38.826
Let's say we're able to get the gold.

35:39.981 --> 35:42.524
How do I know you're
not gonna take your share,

35:42.525 --> 35:45.666
pack your things
and to Switzerland?

35:45.903 --> 35:49.364
You're asking me to
put my men at risk.

35:49.365 --> 35:52.339
And potentially get them killed for what?

35:52.785 --> 35:56.886
What guarantee do we have
that you'll do what you say?

35:57.039 --> 35:59.096
You're correct.

35:59.375 --> 36:03.058
If you do this, I can not
tell you the future.

36:03.838 --> 36:06.645
But I can tell you
that I do not lie.

36:07.758 --> 36:10.316
My heart is with my country.

36:10.344 --> 36:12.610
In this gold I see hope.

36:12.805 --> 36:15.321
And hope is the only
thing we have left.

36:18.603 --> 36:20.576
Alright.

36:22.106 --> 36:24.413
Three hundred million.

36:24.442 --> 36:26.526
- Splits 6 ways.
- Two ways.

36:26.527 --> 36:29.710
- Excuse me?
- Split two ways.

36:30.448 --> 36:34.089
One half to you, the
other half to my people.

36:34.202 --> 36:36.133
50/50.

36:36.329 --> 36:39.053
You take it or leave it.

36:42.293 --> 36:44.002
We'll be risking everything.

36:44.003 --> 36:46.129
- Our careers...
- How about our lives?

36:46.130 --> 36:48.381
You know, I like my life.

36:48.382 --> 36:52.636
Right Stakes, when you ask navy Seal,
it's wrong to even be talking about it.

36:52.637 --> 36:54.429
We are talking about
a major operation.

36:54.430 --> 36:57.098
In a hot zone in which
we have no authority.

36:57.099 --> 36:58.271
It's just, it's crazy.

36:58.371 --> 37:00.435
It's too goddamn crazy to
even be considering it.

37:00.436 --> 37:03.522
- What if we could?
- You want to try? Be my guest.

37:03.523 --> 37:05.788
Stanton's right.

37:06.567 --> 37:08.276
What if we could?

37:08.277 --> 37:11.627
We've been here six months.
What have we done?

37:11.781 --> 37:15.339
Now this isn't a military operation,
it's a covert mop up drill.

37:15.409 --> 37:17.911
This is a chance to
do something extraordinary.

37:17.912 --> 37:20.219
To help these people.

37:20.331 --> 37:23.013
It's once in a lifetime
opportunity, boys.

37:23.376 --> 37:25.891
It's once in a million.

37:27.672 --> 37:29.812
So what do you say boys?

37:38.224 --> 37:40.531
Let me ask you something.

37:41.269 --> 37:44.326
You and me, all this time...

37:45.439 --> 37:47.746
Was it only to get the gold?

37:51.404 --> 37:54.545
I did choose you because
I know you can help me.

37:55.658 --> 37:58.591
But then... I fall for you.

38:00.037 --> 38:02.136
You can believe me.

38:03.374 --> 38:05.514
I love you.

38:08.713 --> 38:12.062
We are in.
All of us.

38:43.289 --> 38:45.596
<i>Keep looking.</i>

38:46.459 --> 38:48.418
According to Lara's grandfather,

38:48.419 --> 38:52.339
the Germans were loading the gold into
the bank before the dam blew.

38:52.340 --> 38:54.016
Inside the bank is a vault made in

38:54.216 --> 38:55.842
Lorca, Spain, crafted in the 30s.

38:55.843 --> 38:58.428
That's the serial number.
Find out the kind of the steel,

38:58.429 --> 39:00.594
thickness, lock mechanism,
anything that's

39:00.794 --> 39:02.599
gonna help us bust that thing open.

39:02.600 --> 39:05.727
That's the base's supply inventory.
Identify the gear we'll need.

39:05.728 --> 39:07.187
- Figure how to borrow it.
- Done.

39:07.188 --> 39:10.524
There is a long wooden dock about
300 yards from our dive point.

39:10.525 --> 39:13.610
We'll launch from there.
We'll dive in three teams of two.

39:13.611 --> 39:17.948
Right. We're gonna need magnesium, burning
bars and pure O2 to cut though this steel.

39:17.949 --> 39:19.533
And also a generator.

39:19.534 --> 39:21.743
- And ten air tanks each night.
- You got 'em.

39:21.744 --> 39:24.079
- How many nights you're talking?
- Oh, I figure five.

39:24.080 --> 39:27.415
We take turns dive in 10 minute intervals
to avoid decompression sickness.

39:27.416 --> 39:30.293
Supply cloaks are tight asses
when it comes to air tanks.

39:30.294 --> 39:35.549
But you know what's funny, SAS just happen
to have whole bunch of that lying around.

39:35.550 --> 39:37.634
Assholes messed up the extract
in our last op.

39:37.635 --> 39:39.425
They should be more than
happy to help us out.

39:39.449 --> 39:41.789
If they don't, we help ourselves.

39:41.989 --> 39:44.198
Anybody except me
wanna know how we're gonna

39:44.398 --> 39:46.407
get 2,000 gold bars up out of that lake?

39:52.483 --> 39:53.942
What do we need?

39:53.943 --> 39:57.404
Batteries, thermal
lenses, burn bars...

39:57.405 --> 40:00.129
- Ask him for burning bars.
<i>- Electrode.</i>

40:02.023 --> 40:04.712
<i>They are here to help us, Mr. Kurjak.</i>

40:10.543 --> 40:13.058
I'll take that as a yes.

40:14.046 --> 40:18.606
Yeah, awesome. Alright,
so, we need twenty of them.

40:18.890 --> 40:20.018
<i>Twenty pieces.</i>

40:27.143 --> 40:28.226
What's so funny?

40:28.227 --> 40:31.786
He asked if you Americans
plan to rob a bank.

40:32.440 --> 40:34.691
So, the vault was
sophisticated for a height.

40:34.692 --> 40:37.569
4 inches of tempered steel over
half a meter of concrete.

40:37.570 --> 40:39.738
JP, that'll take us
days to burn through.

40:39.739 --> 40:42.115
But to save money, vault
manufactures made the

40:42.116 --> 40:45.869
side walls that lie next to interior walls
half that thickness.

40:45.870 --> 40:48.371
And the vault is against
the wall of the church next door.

40:48.372 --> 40:50.457
Alright.
So we're going that way.

40:50.458 --> 40:53.170
I swear to God, if we...
We get this gold out,

40:53.370 --> 40:55.962
I'm going to put this on humanitarian use.

40:55.963 --> 40:58.715
- What? So are you on brewery?
- Duffy's ale House, yeah.

40:58.716 --> 41:00.467
- I see a Nobel Prize.
- Thank you.

41:00.468 --> 41:02.385
- Cheers to that.
- I am not to piss on your parade...

41:02.386 --> 41:05.430
but if we can't find a way to get
several tons of gold out of that lake,

41:05.431 --> 41:08.155
- You ain't brewing shit.
- Good point.

41:24.492 --> 41:27.133
What the hell you
doing in here, Duffy?!

41:28.704 --> 41:32.847
- I just wanted to stop by for a chat, Walt.
- No, no, no.

41:33.376 --> 41:36.725
- You don't chat.
- Well, the shopping then.

41:38.923 --> 41:40.966
- Dimitri?
- My name is Sergei.

41:40.967 --> 41:42.843
Ah... Sergei, good!

41:42.844 --> 41:44.829
You're familiar with the North Atlantic

41:45.029 --> 41:47.472
Treaty Organization's operation,
Joint endeavor?

41:47.473 --> 41:50.058
- I know nothing...
- Well I do.

41:50.059 --> 41:51.643
More important
than your knowledge

41:51.644 --> 41:54.646
is your willingness
to assist the joint task force

41:54.647 --> 41:57.274
- in this urgent, secret mission.
- Top secret.

41:57.275 --> 41:59.582
Top secret?

41:59.694 --> 42:01.542
How can I help?

42:01.571 --> 42:04.879
Oh, we need a company vehicle
just for a few days.

42:04.949 --> 42:07.033
I would need to ask permission...

42:07.034 --> 42:11.663
Sergei, which part of top secret
did you fail understand?

42:11.664 --> 42:13.331
I mean lives are at stake.

42:13.332 --> 42:16.418
You would be doing people of
your country a huge service.

42:16.419 --> 42:18.920
I wouldn't be surprise if
you are held as a hero.

42:18.921 --> 42:21.270
Maybe even a medal.

42:28.139 --> 42:29.890
Thank you, Sergei.

42:29.891 --> 42:32.893
And from this point forth, you
have to deny everything.

42:32.894 --> 42:34.853
If anyone asks where
that vehicle is,

42:34.854 --> 42:37.328
Then you don't know because...?

42:40.735 --> 42:42.235
Because...?

42:42.236 --> 42:46.545
- I don't know.
- Exactly, exactly. Thank you sir.

42:52.121 --> 42:55.054
<i>All right, Bob.
Nice and steady, huh?</i>

42:55.166 --> 42:57.473
<i>OK, you can come, you can come.</i>

42:58.628 --> 43:02.214
- Triple 70 equipment supply company?
- Yeah that's it.

43:02.215 --> 43:06.760
Altoona, Pennsylvania, delighting
the customers since 1971.

43:06.761 --> 43:08.470
That's one.

43:08.471 --> 43:13.280
- Alright! Don't stay out too late, ladies.
- No we won't. Thank you.

43:34.789 --> 43:36.637
Alright!

43:39.085 --> 43:42.268
I'll grab what's left
That's a good little base, bud.

43:45.508 --> 43:48.232
Got any family, Mr. Matt?

43:48.678 --> 43:50.720
Back home?

43:50.721 --> 43:55.239
- No, I don't.
- You look like a family man.

43:56.060 --> 43:57.853
I'm not.

43:57.854 --> 44:01.495
And now is not the time for
little talk or therapy sessions.

44:21.252 --> 44:24.713
Stay quite, don't
make a sound, okay?

44:24.714 --> 44:26.812
Stay down.

44:49.059 --> 44:50.448
<i>Let's go, guys!</i>

45:07.006 --> 45:09.480
You are okay? C'mon.

45:10.176 --> 45:12.942
- It's alright, you okay?
- Yeah.

45:15.097 --> 45:17.029
Thanks, Matt.

45:50.133 --> 45:52.425
<i>- What's that?
- You know very well, old man.</i>

45:52.426 --> 45:55.178
<i>Do you know that this can buy
your shitty dump a hundred times?</i>

45:55.179 --> 45:56.763
<i>So what?</i>

45:56.764 --> 46:00.614
<i>What am I going to do with that?
I need cash!</i>

46:04.772 --> 46:06.620
<i>Like this...</i>

46:12.697 --> 46:15.407
So, thing about gold is it's heavy.

46:15.408 --> 46:17.325
Each gold bar, weighs about 27 pounds.

46:17.326 --> 46:20.203
If there is really 2000 bars
then they're gonna weigh

46:20.204 --> 46:21.788
27 tonnes.

46:21.789 --> 46:23.628
Alright, that means we're
gonna have to make

46:23.828 --> 46:25.709
multiple runs to get
her all up out of there.

46:25.710 --> 46:29.087
- So how long's that gonna take?
- No, I can get it out in one shot.

46:29.088 --> 46:32.229
- Hey, how did it go yesterday?
- Not good.

46:32.508 --> 46:35.051
Patrol boats, every 35
minutes on that lake.

46:35.052 --> 46:38.513
Petrovic hit on a convoy this morning,
it's a hot zone out there.

46:38.514 --> 46:40.807
Boys, if we get compromised,

46:40.808 --> 46:44.325
we do not engage,
withdraw, operation over.

46:44.353 --> 46:45.979
Alright, so what do you guys got?

46:45.980 --> 46:47.799
Einstein here was about
to tell us how we're

46:47.999 --> 46:49.941
gonna get all the gold
out of lake at one shot.

46:49.942 --> 46:51.318
- Really?
- Yep.

46:51.319 --> 46:53.778
So, we need something
that can displace water,

46:53.779 --> 46:57.296
but still bear the weight of the gold
when it's at the surface.

46:58.201 --> 47:01.203
An cargo net,
spread out on the floor of the lake.

47:01.204 --> 47:03.663
So what we'll do is,
we'll have the gold right on top,

47:03.664 --> 47:06.416
then we take four small lifting
bags on each corner,

47:06.417 --> 47:07.790
raise them till we gather to a point

47:07.814 --> 47:09.211
where we can add a
very large lifting bag,

47:09.212 --> 47:11.213
but it's not enough.

47:11.214 --> 47:16.398
We'll have to do, straight over the top,
a cargo parachute, the more volume.

47:19.555 --> 47:21.598
Add a little bit of air and...

47:21.599 --> 47:23.725
- Straight up to the surface.
- Strong enough?

47:23.726 --> 47:25.574
Yeah, it's a Kevlar weave,
yeah, plenty of strong.

47:25.598 --> 47:26.359
It's brilliant.

47:26.559 --> 47:29.231
- Almost. Still a problem.
- I knew he wasn't that smart.

47:29.232 --> 47:33.082
That's how we get to the surface,
but how did we get on land?

47:34.403 --> 47:36.669
Oh... You know I got that.

47:50.336 --> 47:52.546
- Whoa.
- Tickle his balls.

47:55.466 --> 47:58.566
He calls it tickling his
balls, isn't that right, D?

48:01.639 --> 48:04.530
Ever consider the nuisances down there?

48:05.226 --> 48:08.228
Like a surface-to-air missiles?
RPG?

48:08.229 --> 48:10.744
No, shit like that
just bums him out.

48:30.793 --> 48:32.747
See that wooden dock 200 meters out?

48:32.947 --> 48:34.629
That's where our drop position.

48:34.630 --> 48:36.923
What's down there that requires
you're off the books mission?

48:36.924 --> 48:39.857
Gold. Nazi gold.

48:40.178 --> 48:42.504
As much as one million
for you two to split.

48:42.704 --> 48:44.598
Well, that's the magic number.

48:44.599 --> 48:49.200
Next to flying, Detroit here simply
loves money, ain't that right, D?

48:52.106 --> 48:55.192
- What's the object?
- Well, you drop us here.

48:55.193 --> 48:59.446
Then you pick us and the gold
drop at the agreed upon time.

48:59.447 --> 49:01.781
We split it up and
go on merry ways.

49:01.782 --> 49:04.089
Sounds like good plan.

49:04.327 --> 49:06.786
The cargo's gonna be heavy.
Gonna be a problem?

49:06.787 --> 49:08.467
Not if you're sending
a super sea stallion.

49:08.653 --> 49:10.081
Well, you can fly one of those?

49:10.082 --> 49:14.002
The man can fly everything.
Stallions, Dragons, Apache...

49:14.003 --> 49:16.713
You fit a tail rotor
on Pamela Anderson,

49:16.714 --> 49:19.591
- he's gonna fly her too.
- Is that right?

49:19.592 --> 49:22.733
- 3 days notice is all we need.
- Good.

49:23.471 --> 49:28.989
Boys, we are in enemy territory.
Shit could get real hot out here.

49:41.155 --> 49:43.087
Where did he go?

50:35.585 --> 50:39.393
Alright!
How about you take me home?

50:43.634 --> 50:45.983
<i>That's what they gave me.</i>

50:46.637 --> 50:49.431
<i>- Have you ever seen them before?
- Them? Never.</i>

50:49.432 --> 50:52.698
<i>Just some punks...
Those are their plates.</i>

50:53.394 --> 50:56.535
<i>What you did is very patriotic..</i>

50:59.400 --> 51:01.916
<i>A very unusual and valuable item.</i>

51:03.112 --> 51:05.211
<i>Where's it from?</i>

51:08.242 --> 51:10.549
<i>I found it.</i>

51:13.206 --> 51:15.930
<i>From now on, I'll
only speak to you...</i>

51:21.547 --> 51:24.105
<i>Now you'll tell me everything.</i>

51:26.344 --> 51:30.277
What about decompression?
That depth is gonna be an issue.

51:30.681 --> 51:33.823
- We might control the sense.
- There you are.

51:34.352 --> 51:37.409
Levin wants you and your
team in his office, on the double.

51:38.105 --> 51:41.274
Do you ladies have any idea
why you're standing here before me?

51:41.275 --> 51:44.583
- I have an idea, sir.
- You do not have a clue, Barnes.

51:44.695 --> 51:48.323
- That's what I meant to say, sir.
- Yours truly...

51:48.324 --> 51:52.994
and General Tobias himself
met with SAS command yesterday.

51:52.995 --> 51:55.914
We conducted an evaluation
of your recent operation,

51:55.915 --> 52:00.683
which I supervised with my
customary intelligence and thoroughness.

52:00.920 --> 52:03.004
This investigation led to the

52:03.005 --> 52:06.550
determination of what many had
come to suspect about 2-2 SAS team.

52:06.551 --> 52:08.218
Do you know what that would be, Lieutenant?

52:08.219 --> 52:10.929
That we are a bunch of
crumpled munching pussies sir?

52:10.930 --> 52:12.653
Correcte mundo.

52:13.516 --> 52:16.449
Furthermore, during
the course of said review,

52:16.727 --> 52:20.939
the resourceful tactics and heroic
actions of this team came to light.

52:20.940 --> 52:24.067
General Tobias was
particularly impressed.

52:24.068 --> 52:27.821
Please do not start waving
your tiny little penises around.

52:27.822 --> 52:29.948
Which reminds me,

52:29.949 --> 52:32.400
my arrogant little prick
of a brother-in-law

52:32.600 --> 52:34.717
sent me a box of this 50 dollar cigars

52:34.745 --> 52:37.636
to commemorate the
occasion of my birth.

52:37.748 --> 52:41.001
Now, personally, I'd assume
grind one out in his eye,

52:41.002 --> 52:43.336
since he only does this
to flaunt his wealth,

52:43.337 --> 52:47.215
thereby fueling his erroneous assertion
of his own superiority.

52:47.216 --> 52:49.843
Classic Napoleon complex.

52:49.844 --> 52:52.026
But I digress.

52:53.389 --> 52:57.767
It seems... That a significant
number of Serb head hunters

52:57.768 --> 53:00.896
are actively searching to
kill you knuckleheads.

53:00.897 --> 53:04.274
Well sir, we welcome them to try.

53:04.275 --> 53:05.817
I am sure you would.

53:05.818 --> 53:09.126
Fortunately for them, that
opportunity will not arrive.

53:10.198 --> 53:12.574
Joint command wants this
whole mess to go away.

53:12.575 --> 53:16.828
And by this whole mess I do mean
specifically the five of you.

53:16.829 --> 53:19.789
- Really, Sir?
- You are being redeployed.

53:19.790 --> 53:22.431
As far away from here
as humanely possible.

53:23.044 --> 53:24.836
In the meantime, you
are shipping home.

53:24.837 --> 53:27.506
Transport plane to Mannheim
departs in 36 hours.

53:27.507 --> 53:30.759
And your supremely lucky
asses will be on it.

53:30.760 --> 53:32.886
Until then you are
remanded to base.

53:32.887 --> 53:34.971
With all due respect, Sir,

53:34.972 --> 53:40.060
we don't believe that our work here
has been fully accomplished.

53:40.061 --> 53:42.201
Appreciate that sentiment.

53:42.897 --> 53:45.913
Unfortunately, this is
above my pay grade.

53:45.942 --> 53:48.249
Dismissed.

53:50.947 --> 53:53.129
Chief, so what do you wanna to?

53:53.157 --> 53:56.674
What do you mean, what do I wanna do?
You heard the man.

53:57.036 --> 53:59.969
We're shipping out.
We're done.

54:00.373 --> 54:03.514
Pack your things.
Let's get drunk.

54:43.457 --> 54:45.389
I'm sorry, Stanton.

54:46.919 --> 54:49.894
I know you really wanted to
do this for her.

54:55.094 --> 54:57.276
You love her, don't you?

54:59.599 --> 55:01.906
It's a stupid question.

55:06.814 --> 55:10.331
- You want me to tell her?
- What? That I love her?

55:13.237 --> 55:16.837
No, you can tell her now, himself.

55:19.118 --> 55:21.425
See you two together...

55:24.123 --> 55:26.430
makes me happy, Stanton.

55:51.108 --> 55:53.415
You shouldn't have, Giacomo.

55:53.444 --> 55:56.252
Looks like we got
a go on away party.

55:56.531 --> 55:58.644
- SAS, right?
- That's right, mate.

55:58.744 --> 56:00.098
What can I do you for?

56:00.198 --> 56:03.995
There is absolutely nothing
that you guys can do for us,

56:03.996 --> 56:07.123
but we dragged the fat
fish and ship eating asses out

56:07.124 --> 56:09.167
- of a world war.
- Two of them.

56:09.168 --> 56:12.504
Two. Two world wars.

56:12.505 --> 56:16.313
And you ladies can not run a
simple extract op out of Bosnia.

56:17.009 --> 56:20.651
- You're drunk, mate.
- No... Not drunk enough.

56:56.132 --> 56:58.439
How you doing, Porter?

57:00.720 --> 57:03.569
- Clear left.
- Clear right.

57:04.140 --> 57:06.489
Pays to be a winner.

57:07.393 --> 57:10.645
My dad, he was a
career naval officer.

57:10.646 --> 57:12.564
So is my grand dad.

57:12.565 --> 57:16.290
They both fought in a war.
Who do we fighting in?

57:17.987 --> 57:21.128
A stupid peacekeeping mission.

57:27.205 --> 57:29.428
You lost.

57:33.711 --> 57:36.644
- What?
- What you been doing?

57:36.714 --> 57:38.813
You been fighting?

57:38.975 --> 57:40.073
No!

57:40.173 --> 57:43.275
So you didn't run
into any of the SAS?

57:43.721 --> 57:48.141
It's funny. Those things in your
faces seem like you did.

57:48.142 --> 57:50.116
Yeah...

57:51.479 --> 57:53.605
- Cheers to that.
- We'll make you proud chief.

57:53.606 --> 57:56.358
- Oh you do.
- Cheers... To your next battle.

57:56.359 --> 57:58.165
Yes sir.

58:02.490 --> 58:04.866
What? You couldn't
do it. You lost.

58:04.867 --> 58:07.619
- Rack him up again?
- What?

58:07.620 --> 58:09.913
- I got something.
- Oh yeah, a full glass.

58:09.914 --> 58:12.555
No, no, listen.
Follow me, follow me.

58:14.335 --> 58:16.294
- What do you got?
- So.

58:16.295 --> 58:18.922
Reason it's gonna take us a week
to get into that vault is

58:18.923 --> 58:20.966
- we can only do an one hour dive, right?
- Yeah.

58:20.967 --> 58:22.844
But if we build a operation base somewhere

58:23.044 --> 58:25.011
down there,
an air pocket we can work out...

58:25.012 --> 58:28.598
We can work non stop and
decompressing right at the end.

58:28.599 --> 58:32.158
Yeah, a airtight area
we can pump air into.

58:36.440 --> 58:40.207
Smart man,
get Stanton on the phone.

58:40.319 --> 58:42.654
Yeah, altar is on the main level.

58:42.655 --> 58:45.782
Above that's the choir gallery.
The steeple made out of stone.

58:45.783 --> 58:49.300
- Is there a bell inside the steeple?
<i>- Solid bronze.</i>

58:49.495 --> 58:51.580
Well then, we start by
pumping air out of the bell.

58:51.581 --> 58:54.249
<i>And then we'll load in the generator
and we pump up the choir floor.</i>

58:54.250 --> 58:56.251
That will be our operation's base.

58:56.252 --> 58:59.921
- How long do you think this op will take?
- Eight hours tops.

58:59.922 --> 59:02.646
We could be back before sun rise.

59:02.967 --> 59:05.649
Get the gear down to the dock
as fast as you can.

59:11.642 --> 59:14.241
The operation we talked about...

59:14.312 --> 59:16.619
We're going tonight.

59:17.273 --> 59:19.316
What!

59:19.317 --> 59:23.250
What did I tell you all?
In three days notice.

59:23.988 --> 59:26.239
Can't requisition a
helicopter just like that.

59:26.240 --> 59:28.575
Alright.
What about pickup?

59:28.576 --> 59:31.133
Sun up.
Can you do it?

59:32.788 --> 59:36.514
- Same coordinates?
- 0-44-9 on the bun.

59:38.294 --> 59:42.436
You might wanna lay off that shit
a few hours in advance.

59:44.509 --> 59:47.594
Hey, do you know where we can find
another aircraft flying around?

59:47.595 --> 59:49.735
Pilot included?

59:58.064 --> 01:00:01.149
Hey Porter! Give me something good man.
We need bird.

01:00:01.150 --> 01:00:04.236
There is a C-160 in the north hangar.
It's just got back from the refueling run.

01:00:04.237 --> 01:00:07.030
- Subtle.
- Yeah, that's my middle name.

01:00:07.031 --> 01:00:09.171
Alright, Ben, take it down.

01:00:14.705 --> 01:00:17.374
- Let's go! Orders just come in.
- What orders?

01:00:17.375 --> 01:00:19.055
We didn't get any authorization for any...

01:00:19.106 --> 01:00:21.002
Emergency operation in
under five minutes to go.

01:00:21.003 --> 01:00:23.380
- Thought SAS would seal transport
- Yeah, they were.

01:00:23.381 --> 01:00:26.424
But command decided we needed
real men flying us on this mission.

01:00:26.425 --> 01:00:29.136
That's you guys.
So, load her up.

01:00:29.137 --> 01:00:31.444
Load her up, boys.

01:01:00.877 --> 01:01:02.808
Two minutes!

01:02:59.829 --> 01:03:04.013
Hey chief, I think this crazy
idea might just work.

01:03:14.510 --> 01:03:17.318
Nice plan...
Nice plan.

01:04:40.179 --> 01:04:44.029
- You okay?
- Yeah, no problems.

01:05:27.643 --> 01:05:29.784
Good.

01:05:43.951 --> 01:05:45.883
<i>Is that her?</i>

01:05:47.955 --> 01:05:49.929
<i>She won't get far.</i>

01:05:52.668 --> 01:05:54.809
<i>Stay with him.</i>

01:06:49.892 --> 01:06:52.032
Two, three!

01:06:57.775 --> 01:06:59.901
Here you go.

01:06:59.902 --> 01:07:01.862
All right, boys.

01:07:01.863 --> 01:07:04.823
Time to drill through a stone wall.
Say your prayers.

01:07:04.824 --> 01:07:08.090
We break the wall,
break the vault...

01:07:08.286 --> 01:07:10.217
Gold deluxe.

01:08:30.868 --> 01:08:32.993
Mortar around the stone
is starting to oxidize.

01:08:32.995 --> 01:08:35.872
- From the air we're pumping in.
- How long it is gonna hold?

01:08:35.872 --> 01:08:39.390
Not long. This place has not
seen oxygen for 50 years.

01:08:46.591 --> 01:08:47.968
- Sir?
- Yeah?

01:08:47.969 --> 01:08:50.095
I saw Porter with Rainey
and Detroit the other day.

01:08:50.095 --> 01:08:52.221
Very animated conversation.

01:08:52.223 --> 01:08:54.554
Get Rainey and Detroit
into my office ASAP.

01:08:54.723 --> 01:08:55.723
Yes, sir!

01:09:14.203 --> 01:09:17.051
- Time check, boys?
- We are four hours.

01:09:17.206 --> 01:09:20.389
- How much air we got left?
- Two hours at the most.

01:09:23.129 --> 01:09:25.130
- Get back!
- Go, go, go, go!

01:09:25.131 --> 01:09:26.798
Move it!

01:09:26.799 --> 01:09:28.898
Go! Get down!

01:09:30.094 --> 01:09:31.984
Where's the crowbar?

01:09:36.392 --> 01:09:39.325
Give me that.
It's gonna jam up here.

01:09:59.791 --> 01:10:02.723
Well, you two, were seen
with them recently.

01:10:02.877 --> 01:10:04.878
And I wanna know,
what they are up to.

01:10:04.879 --> 01:10:09.466
Sir... We are super friendly individuals.
We talk to just about anybody.

01:10:09.467 --> 01:10:11.885
It is harder to remember
one from another.

01:10:11.886 --> 01:10:15.945
Lieutenant, if you withhold
information from me,

01:10:16.140 --> 01:10:20.560
I will see to it that this man straps
his ass into a cockpit ever again.

01:10:20.561 --> 01:10:23.230
Sir, with all due respect...

01:10:23.231 --> 01:10:24.773
Stop right there, Lieutenant.

01:10:24.774 --> 01:10:28.693
In my experience, when a man rephrase a
statement with the phrase with all respect,

01:10:28.694 --> 01:10:31.780
he is about to say something
disrespectful and quite possibly stupid.

01:10:31.781 --> 01:10:34.880
Are you certain you wish to continue.

01:10:35.952 --> 01:10:38.954
- Sir, yes.
- Be my guest.

01:10:38.955 --> 01:10:44.042
This man received 14 medals for
heroic and meritorious acts.

01:10:44.043 --> 01:10:46.503
Once flew an FA-18 in battle
one of his engines blown off,

01:10:46.504 --> 01:10:48.421
he refueled mid-flight,

01:10:48.422 --> 01:10:50.340
because he knew if he returned to the
base, he would be grounded.

01:10:50.341 --> 01:10:55.484
The point is Detroit Turner
is the best pilot the Navy has.

01:10:56.806 --> 01:10:58.807
Well I believe you might
be right, Lieutenant.

01:10:58.808 --> 01:11:01.115
I need you.

01:11:04.564 --> 01:11:07.121
I do not need you, however.

01:11:07.567 --> 01:11:10.152
- Petty officer Clearwater?
- Sir?

01:11:10.153 --> 01:11:13.043
Prepare discharge papers
for Lieutenant Rainey.

01:11:13.156 --> 01:11:15.045
Yes, sir!

01:11:21.873 --> 01:11:25.514
You are suddenly uncharacteristic
quite Lieutenant.

01:11:26.002 --> 01:11:29.143
You sure there is not something
you'd like to share with me?

01:11:48.608 --> 01:11:50.539
<i>Keep going.</i>

01:11:53.529 --> 01:11:57.546
So, me and Porter are gonna go down first.
Alright? Then you two.

01:12:01.537 --> 01:12:03.511
Understand?

01:12:07.418 --> 01:12:11.936
- You are friends for a long time?
- Can't remember the time we weren't.

01:12:12.256 --> 01:12:14.216
I see sadness in him.

01:12:14.217 --> 01:12:18.567
- Yeah, well, we all got our troubles, Lara.
- His is at home.

01:12:20.389 --> 01:12:22.613
His wife.

01:12:23.184 --> 01:12:26.228
He does not talk about it anymore.
Not even to me.

01:12:26.229 --> 01:12:28.327
What happened?

01:12:31.484 --> 01:12:34.250
Two years ago his wife
got into a car accident.

01:12:34.278 --> 01:12:36.418
She survived.

01:12:36.572 --> 01:12:39.338
Their little girl, Billie...

01:12:40.493 --> 01:12:42.800
She didn't.

01:12:43.037 --> 01:12:45.136
She was three.

01:12:45.414 --> 01:12:48.917
Went home to bury her. And after
that nothing was same between them.

01:12:48.918 --> 01:12:50.850
Matt just...

01:12:52.004 --> 01:12:54.520
Matt just can't forgive her.

01:14:32.104 --> 01:14:35.621
So, now she done nothing to say, huh?

01:14:36.192 --> 01:14:37.235
JP!

01:14:37.435 --> 01:14:39.110
And what about you,
lover boy? No comment?

01:14:39.111 --> 01:14:41.112
JP, enough!

01:14:41.113 --> 01:14:43.365
What? It was a waste of time.
There's nothing down there.

01:14:43.366 --> 01:14:45.534
- I don't understand.
- Let me explain to you.

01:14:45.535 --> 01:14:49.343
- There was no gold!
- Alright, cut it out, boys.

01:14:49.622 --> 01:14:52.430
- Lara, it's not your fault.
- What?

01:14:52.542 --> 01:14:55.460
- It is her fault.
- JP, It's not her fault.

01:14:55.461 --> 01:14:57.546
It was a story told to a kid.

01:14:57.547 --> 01:14:59.631
To any kid that would
look like a lot of gold.

01:14:59.632 --> 01:15:02.050
Village must have flooded
before they got it out of the trucks.

01:15:02.051 --> 01:15:04.136
The gold must be scattered
all over the valley.

01:15:04.137 --> 01:15:05.462
It's another story, Stanton?

01:15:05.523 --> 01:15:09.321
At least we got ourselves
10 bars of Gold!

01:15:09.475 --> 01:15:12.992
Alright? That is a hell
of a lot money for me.

01:15:13.312 --> 01:15:15.619
And for us.

01:15:15.731 --> 01:15:18.692
- And for you.
- Good point Duffy.

01:15:18.693 --> 01:15:23.002
- Great, great. I'm getting out of it.
- You're getting us all out of here.

01:15:23.072 --> 01:15:26.755
Super C-8, this is F-150.
What is your status?

01:15:27.743 --> 01:15:31.510
<i>We're about lift off, brother.
See you all soon.</i>

01:16:11.829 --> 01:16:15.040
- What's going on, chief?
- The wall down there with Latin words...

01:16:15.041 --> 01:16:17.765
It's wrong.
The stone is upside down.

01:16:18.419 --> 01:16:20.226
Grab that.

01:16:20.671 --> 01:16:23.229
Let's smash away through that wall
and see what's behind.

01:19:21.978 --> 01:19:23.826
<i>Gear up!</i>

01:21:05.206 --> 01:21:07.179
<i>Throw the explosives.</i>

01:21:09.919 --> 01:21:11.795
- Everybody all right?
- You are okay?

01:21:11.796 --> 01:21:14.881
- No way to tell, how many are up there.
- Does not matter.

01:21:14.882 --> 01:21:18.441
- Let's finish the job we're doing, alright?
- All right, let's move.

01:22:33.669 --> 01:22:35.810
<i>Lower, lower!</i>

01:24:23.988 --> 01:24:26.698
So, remind me again,
who did the math?

01:24:26.699 --> 01:24:28.617
And how much air do
we need down here huh?

01:24:28.618 --> 01:24:31.328
- Oh yeah, the Math genius.
- I'm sorry, I didn't count enough.

01:24:31.329 --> 01:24:33.246
With some crazy Serbs
shoving grenades at us, OK?

01:24:33.247 --> 01:24:35.749
It's called a contingency plan.

01:24:35.750 --> 01:24:38.794
Prepare for the worst. There are boy
scouts who know this, for crying out loud.

01:24:38.795 --> 01:24:40.921
You're breathing air, right?
That's because of this Math genius.

01:24:40.922 --> 01:24:43.006
So, why don't you just shut your mouth
and stop hogging my half of the air?

01:24:43.007 --> 01:24:44.485
I'm gonna buy you a
calculator for your next

01:24:44.509 --> 01:24:47.233
birthday, you know that, Ben?
A nice big calc...

01:24:47.512 --> 01:24:49.221
- Hey, Lara.
- Hey.

01:24:49.222 --> 01:24:50.931
- You alright?
- Yeah.

01:24:50.932 --> 01:24:52.432
Okay.

01:24:52.433 --> 01:24:53.892
- And you too, Ben? You alright?
- I'm fine.

01:24:53.893 --> 01:24:56.450
- Good.
- I'm fine.

01:24:57.313 --> 01:25:00.065
We'll need little more air to
get to the surface.

01:25:00.066 --> 01:25:02.818
- There is a couple of tanks in the trash.
- Great.

01:25:02.819 --> 01:25:05.570
- I'll go with you.
- No, stay here.

01:25:05.571 --> 01:25:08.254
Alright? Stay here.

01:25:10.660 --> 01:25:12.953
- Hey dude?
- Yes?

01:25:12.954 --> 01:25:14.357
We need way more air.

01:25:14.857 --> 01:25:17.763
Hey, Porter,
do not even start with that OK?

01:27:14.450 --> 01:27:16.034
- Nice!
- You ready?

01:27:16.035 --> 01:27:18.703
Alright, we got enemies on the surface
and no primary...

01:27:18.704 --> 01:27:21.540
- So what? We use the secondary.
- All right.

01:27:21.541 --> 01:27:23.472
Here we go.

01:27:39.225 --> 01:27:42.450
Watch for signs of
decompression sickness.

01:27:42.937 --> 01:27:45.202
We're good, we're good
We got this.

01:27:57.952 --> 01:28:00.092
<i>Straight ahead!</i>

01:28:09.755 --> 01:28:11.479
Shit!

01:28:11.632 --> 01:28:13.773
<i>Give it to me.</i>

01:28:26.147 --> 01:28:28.078
Shit!

01:28:29.609 --> 01:28:32.374
<i>I always said I
will go out with a bang.</i>

01:28:41.913 --> 01:28:45.429
Time to feed the
fishes, assholes.

01:28:49.212 --> 01:28:51.227
Nice shot!

01:28:55.176 --> 01:28:56.816
Yeah!

01:29:30.128 --> 01:29:32.268
Heads up!

01:30:05.788 --> 01:30:08.265
You degenerates do realize,
as you would be dead

01:30:08.465 --> 01:30:10.625
if I had not sent Detroit to the rescue.

01:30:10.626 --> 01:30:12.461
- Thank you sir.
- I am not interested in a "Thank you".

01:30:12.462 --> 01:30:15.255
But I want you to present
a goddamn explanation.

01:30:15.256 --> 01:30:16.965
And I tell you what you
can start with this...

01:30:16.966 --> 01:30:19.384
Since when the US Navy SEALs

01:30:19.385 --> 01:30:22.526
bring a civilian female
along on a mission?

01:30:22.889 --> 01:30:26.989
Shut up! Finish the decomp
and get your butts up to my office!

01:30:27.018 --> 01:30:28.435
Yes, sir.

01:30:28.436 --> 01:30:31.480
Is that what goes on around this
base on a day to day basis?

01:30:31.481 --> 01:30:35.066
Taking civilian female
out for a little troll?

01:30:35.067 --> 01:30:38.292
Little spin in our humvee
and in our chopper?

01:30:38.571 --> 01:30:41.281
Jesus Christ! This Navy is
not what it used to be!

01:30:41.282 --> 01:30:43.798
Not by a goddamn country mile.

01:30:44.035 --> 01:30:45.475
So you thought, you could just steal

01:30:45.550 --> 01:30:48.552
all that gold and get away with it?
On my watch?

01:30:48.623 --> 01:30:52.626
No, sir. We were gonna
give you a full report, sir.

01:30:52.627 --> 01:30:54.934
- Were you now?
- Yes, sir.

01:30:55.087 --> 01:30:57.380
As soon as the gold was secured.

01:30:57.381 --> 01:31:00.467
- Do I look like a moron to you, Barnes?
- Yes... No, sir.

01:31:00.468 --> 01:31:02.775
No, I'm sorry sir.

01:31:02.929 --> 01:31:04.433
Let me ask you simple to this.

01:31:04.533 --> 01:31:07.140
What did you plan to do
with 27 tons of gold bars?

01:31:07.141 --> 01:31:10.685
- Put it in your socks?
- Sir, turn over it to the people of Bosnia.

01:31:10.686 --> 01:31:13.063
As a way helping rebuild
their country. Sir.

01:31:13.064 --> 01:31:16.997
OK, hold on.
Just... Just a second.

01:31:17.235 --> 01:31:19.416
I might cry.

01:31:22.990 --> 01:31:25.047
No, I don't think I will.

01:31:25.785 --> 01:31:28.370
You realize you broke damn
near every oath you took

01:31:28.371 --> 01:31:31.720
when you decided to embark
on this little escapade?

01:31:31.791 --> 01:31:33.973
Yes, sir.

01:31:34.418 --> 01:31:39.381
Now, I suppose I can spin
this in a positive light,

01:31:39.382 --> 01:31:43.301
emphasize that the operation
lead us Petrovic,

01:31:43.302 --> 01:31:46.777
one of the biggest
stones in NATO's side.

01:31:48.474 --> 01:31:51.518
How much are we talking about
here? I mean in US dollars?

01:31:51.519 --> 01:31:53.270
Sir as of yesterday's exchange rate

01:31:53.271 --> 01:31:56.954
24 tons of gold bars will be
302 million dollars.

01:31:59.068 --> 01:32:02.501
302 million dollars.

01:32:03.197 --> 01:32:05.463
That's a lot of money, isn't it?

01:32:06.284 --> 01:32:09.870
<i>In the midst all the chaos
we are facing in this conflict,</i>

01:32:09.871 --> 01:32:12.998
this operation clearly
demonstrated what can be accomplished

01:32:12.999 --> 01:32:17.725
through the carefully planned and
executed efforts of the US military.

01:32:17.962 --> 01:32:22.674
Thanks to the heroic and
selfless acts of this team of US NAVY SEALs

01:32:22.675 --> 01:32:24.468
and their local contacts,

01:32:24.469 --> 01:32:27.401
I can now announce that this gold,

01:32:27.472 --> 01:32:31.280
stolen by the Nazi
regime 50 years ago,

01:32:31.517 --> 01:32:36.035
and valued at 150
million US dollars,

01:32:36.355 --> 01:32:39.830
will soon be returned to
its rightful place in France.

01:32:40.234 --> 01:32:42.694
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
the Prime Minister of France

01:32:42.695 --> 01:32:47.004
will present Lara Simic
with the <i>Legion d'Honneur</i>.

01:33:03.132 --> 01:33:05.815
Well this is your lucky day, ladies.

01:33:06.385 --> 01:33:08.845
And actual lady.

01:33:08.846 --> 01:33:12.182
- Do you know why it's your lucky day?
- No, sir.

01:33:12.183 --> 01:33:14.518
Because my despicable brother-in-law,

01:33:14.519 --> 01:33:18.396
who also happens to be my
financial adviser and broker,

01:33:18.397 --> 01:33:21.274
was able to unload
those gold bars

01:33:21.275 --> 01:33:24.667
that somehow did not find
their way back to France.

01:33:26.572 --> 01:33:28.879
I'll now distribute...

01:33:29.492 --> 01:33:32.800
your shares of this
momentous heist.

01:33:33.663 --> 01:33:36.178
- Moran.
- Thank you, sir.

01:33:37.500 --> 01:33:40.182
- Duffy.
- Thank you very much, sir.

01:33:41.879 --> 01:33:44.478
- Porter.
- Thank you, sir.

01:33:45.883 --> 01:33:48.983
- Barnes.
- Thank you, sir.

01:33:51.347 --> 01:33:53.487
Baker.

01:33:53.891 --> 01:33:56.240
Ms. Simic.

01:33:57.937 --> 01:34:00.897
Sorry, but don't these
make your lucky day?

01:34:00.898 --> 01:34:02.816
So, we do all the work,
he gets the spoils.

01:34:02.817 --> 01:34:06.167
- You gotta be kidding me.
- Do I look like I'm kidding?

01:34:06.446 --> 01:34:08.919
Have I ever looked
like I was kidding?

01:34:09.198 --> 01:34:11.839
You're lucky you get that,
not a court Marshall.

01:34:13.578 --> 01:34:15.801
Thank you.

01:34:15.955 --> 01:34:18.095
You're welcome.

01:34:30.553 --> 01:34:34.862
Well, that's what you
philanthropists wanted, isn't that right?

01:34:35.141 --> 01:34:37.392
- Yes, sir.
- Excellent.

01:34:37.393 --> 01:34:40.868
Then we should all be happy
as clams at high tide.

01:34:41.355 --> 01:34:44.205
- Dismissed.
- Thank you, sir.

01:34:45.109 --> 01:34:47.249
This...

01:34:48.863 --> 01:34:51.212
This belongs to you too.

01:34:55.787 --> 01:34:57.718
Lara?

01:34:59.665 --> 01:35:01.972
This also belongs to you.

01:35:15.389 --> 01:35:17.808
If I could just get like a flat
or something with my name on it,

01:35:17.809 --> 01:35:19.893
or like a bronze bust,

01:35:19.894 --> 01:35:23.271
even a bowling alley or something,
it would be great, thanks.

01:35:23.272 --> 01:35:25.621
There you go. It's yours.

01:35:37.703 --> 01:35:39.885
We did it.

01:35:42.125 --> 01:35:46.475
You are okay there, sir?
Your eyes seem to be watering.

01:35:46.754 --> 01:35:48.894
Dismissed!

01:35:58.391 --> 01:36:01.240
Come on, cowboys.
I am buying.

01:36:01.561 --> 01:36:03.659
- Oh yes.
- Yes ma'am!

01:36:05.731 --> 01:36:08.873
Alright, enough,
Off to the bar.
