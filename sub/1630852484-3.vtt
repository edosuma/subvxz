This is my son Chris,
and this is my daughter Jaz.

05:04.305 --> 05:07.039
Uh, so, Chris, I understand
that you are interested

05:07.074 --> 05:08.707
in applying for DACA,

05:08.742 --> 05:11.977
and it says here that, uh,
your dad was a U.S. citizen?

05:12.012 --> 05:13.812
-Is that right?
-Yes.

05:13.847 --> 05:15.747
Uh, we met in the Philippines,

05:15.783 --> 05:18.083
but when I found out
I was pregnant,

05:18.118 --> 05:20.552
Jacob had already
moved to the States.

05:20.587 --> 05:23.255
So-so we-we applied
for a fiancée visa,

05:23.290 --> 05:27.192
but by the time I got it,
Chris was already born.

05:27.227 --> 05:29.761
So Chris was born in Manila,
not in the U.S.

05:29.797 --> 05:31.963
Which she lied to me about
for 15 years.

05:31.999 --> 05:33.465
Chris.

05:33.500 --> 05:35.200
WYATT: And when you finally
got to America,

05:35.235 --> 05:36.735
why didn't you get married?

05:36.770 --> 05:39.504
Jacob got in a car accident,
and...

05:39.540 --> 05:41.239
and, uh, he died.

05:41.275 --> 05:42.741
- (scoffs)

05:43.711 --> 05:45.544
Well, Chris, based on this,

05:45.579 --> 05:49.047
I do think you have
a viable path to citizenship.

05:50.484 --> 05:52.851
Oh, my God, he does?
Really?

05:52.886 --> 05:54.619

the Barsamian investigation.

06:50.277 --> 06:51.810
-You

06:51.845 --> 06:53.779
They don't think you can
deliver a prosecutable case--

06:53.814 --> 06:56.081
Well, there's nothin'
to worry about.

06:56.116 --> 06:57.649
I'm working on
a new informant.

06:57.684 --> 07:01.052
About that...
I went through your case notes.

07:01.088 --> 07:03.388
Theo LaMont made repeated
requests to get out.

07:03.424 --> 07:05.290
Oh, come on, have you
ever known an informant

07:05.325 --> 07:07.025
who didn't try
to wiggle off the hook?

07:07.060 --> 07:09.694
And now he's dead.

07:09.730 --> 07:11.563
Which is why I'm not
gonna let Arman Morales

07:11.598 --> 07:13.632
just waltz away
after killing him.

07:13.667 --> 07:15.667
It's not just Theo.

07:15.702 --> 07:17.869
It's what you did
on the Cortez case too.

07:17.905 --> 07:19.004
I know, I know.

07:19.039 --> 07:20.539
I should've taken myself
off that case.

07:20.574 --> 07:24.476
No, I should've fired you after
you slept with an informant.

07:24.511 --> 07:26.211
Pushing paper for a year
was worse.

07:26.246 --> 07:27.779
Really, Garrett?

07:27.815 --> 07:30.382
Colleen left, okay?

07:31.552 --> 07:34.352

07:34.388 --> 07:36.254

I like this position

07:36.290 --> 07:38.323
that you keep putting me in?

07:38.358 --> 07:40.225
You know,
you're a good boss,

07:40.260 --> 07:41.993
but you were a lot more
fun in the field.

07:42.029 --> 07:43.695
I don't know
why you gave that up.

07:43.730 --> 07:45.964
It's called a promotion,
Garrett.

07:45.999 --> 07:47.232
(chuckles)

07:47.267 --> 07:49.034
We need fresh eyes

07:49.069 --> 07:50.735
That's the wrong move.

07:50.771 --> 07:52.737

07:52.773 --> 07:54.840
-I know it.
-She agreed to cooperate?

07:54.875 --> 07:57.642
Just give me some more time.

07:57.678 --> 07:59.411

08:02.382 --> 08:05.016
No.
Absolutely not.

Your real father
was a one-night stand

37:00.911 --> 37:05.547
I had in Manila, and...

37:07.117 --> 37:09.751
I knew there was
no future with him,

37:09.787 --> 37:12.387
and my last boyfriend, Jacob,

37:12.423 --> 37:14.356
had already moved
to the States,

37:14.391 --> 37:19.094
so I--I convinced him
you were his,

37:19.129 --> 37:21.997
but when we got here,
he found out the truth.

37:22.032 --> 37:23.899
Oh, my God.

37:23.934 --> 37:25.233
And I know.
I know.

37:25.269 --> 37:26.969
It was a terrible thing
to do,

37:27.004 --> 37:29.838

37:29.873 --> 37:32.841
I was just young and stupid,
and I just--

37:32.876 --> 37:34.743
(crying)

37:34.778 --> 37:39.014
But I just wanted
what was best for you.

Hey.

Walkie-talkies?

I thought you could give these

39:02.099 --> 39:05.734
Luca's around his age,
and he loves them.

39:12.209 --> 39:16.178
You know, when Luca
was diagnosed...

39:17.915 --> 39:19.748
Doctors gave him
a year to live.

39:22.386 --> 39:25.220
But then a birthday
went by...

39:27.491 --> 39:30.258
And another one,

39:30.294 --> 39:35.197
and another one,

I don't know what's going on

your son on his birthday,

I'm afraid his liver damage is
more extensive than we thought.

It's because of
the adenovirus, isn't it?

41:43.894 --> 41:45.827
Yes.

41:45.862 --> 41:47.696
He's gonna need
a liver transplant.

41:49.299 --> 41:50.498
I'm sorry, Thony,

41:50.534 --> 41:54.169
this disqualifies him
from the trial.

41:54.204 --> 41:56.438
No. No, no. No, no.

41:56.473 --> 41:58.673
We need to fix
his immune system now,

41:58.709 --> 42:00.642
or he'll never survive
a liver transplant.

42:00.677 --> 42:02.077
You know it.

He needs this trial,

I can't do that, Thony.

are strict for a reason.

42:15.292 --> 42:18.393
If just one child presents
with organ failure,

42:18.428 --> 42:20.996
it could shut the trial down
for everyone.

42:22.733 --> 42:24.399
I could pay you.

42:24.434 --> 42:27.502
(whispers) You can do the
treatment off the books.

42:28.705 --> 42:30.272
No one would have to know.

42:32.509 --> 42:34.609

that would be unethical.
