00:03.403 --> 00:05.271
Previously on <i>Total</i>

00:05.271 --> 00:06.272
Divas...

00:06.272 --> 00:07.273
I feel like I could run

00:07.273 --> 00:08.374
Birdiebee.

00:08.374 --> 00:10.176
Like, I could be the president

00:10.176 --> 00:11.878
of the company.

00:11.878 --> 00:12.879
You are taking on

00:12.879 --> 00:13.880
former best friend Nia Jax.

00:13.880 --> 00:14.881
I would legit be

00:14.881 --> 00:15.882
freaking out.

00:15.882 --> 00:16.850
Most people will never have a

00:16.850 --> 00:18.685
singles match in their career.

00:18.685 --> 00:19.753
I'm so stressed.

00:19.753 --> 00:20.954
Not only am I getting to

00:20.954 --> 00:22.288
wrestle on the grandest stage

00:22.288 --> 00:24.024
of them all, but I'm going

00:24.024 --> 00:25.491
against my ex‐best friend Alexa

00:25.491 --> 00:26.560
Bliss.

00:26.560 --> 00:27.628
He loves to come back

00:27.628 --> 00:28.629
and tell me, after he's finished

00:28.629 --> 00:29.630
with Raw, how great the girls

00:29.630 --> 00:30.631
are doing.

00:30.631 --> 00:31.464
Just tell me that I did good

00:31.464 --> 00:32.465
tonight.

00:32.465 --> 00:33.333
TJ doesn't want to give

00:33.333 --> 00:34.334
compliments unless it's on his

00:34.334 --> 00:35.335
terms.

00:35.335 --> 00:36.336
With my neck, I've

00:36.336 --> 00:37.337
tried everything to try and heal

00:37.337 --> 00:38.338
it.

00:38.338 --> 00:39.673
All I want to do is wrestle.

00:39.673 --> 00:40.674
Everything's being taken away

00:40.674 --> 00:43.076
from me right now.

00:43.076 --> 00:45.078
Tonight on <i>Total</i>

00:45.078 --> 00:46.079
Divas...

00:46.079 --> 00:47.581
WrestleMania!

00:47.581 --> 00:48.749
It's gonna be insane

00:48.749 --> 00:49.916
with all the butterflies before

00:49.916 --> 00:51.017
I walk out.

00:52.753 --> 00:53.754
I got into a big

00:53.754 --> 00:54.755
fight with TJ.

00:54.755 --> 00:55.756
Why?

00:55.756 --> 00:56.557
He's in this new

00:56.557 --> 00:57.357
role, and I just feel so

00:57.357 --> 00:58.358
insignificant.

00:58.358 --> 00:59.159
How are we gonna calm

00:59.159 --> 01:00.166
her down?

01:00.166 --> 01:01.234
How are you gonna calm her down?

01:01.234 --> 01:02.035
I know you had to do,

01:02.035 --> 01:02.836
like, the whole speech and stuff

01:02.836 --> 01:03.770
like that.

01:03.770 --> 01:04.437
Yeah.

01:04.437 --> 01:05.171
Well, I have to do it

01:05.171 --> 01:05.839
tomorrow.

01:05.839 --> 01:06.840
This is

01:06.840 --> 01:09.543

01:35.068 --> 01:36.069
We got to celebrate for Trin,

01:36.069 --> 01:37.070
we got to celebrate for Nia.

01:37.070 --> 01:38.071
And we got to sneak by, though.

01:38.071 --> 01:39.072
We got to sneak...

01:39.072 --> 01:40.073
Who else do we have to

01:40.073 --> 01:41.074
celebrate for?

01:41.074 --> 01:41.908
Well, Bryan banned

01:41.908 --> 01:42.909
drink.

01:42.909 --> 01:43.710
But we can drink for

01:43.710 --> 01:44.511
him before we get there.

01:44.511 --> 01:45.378
Oh, that's true.

01:45.378 --> 01:46.212
By the way, we're gonna have to,

01:46.212 --> 01:47.213
like...

01:47.213 --> 01:48.081
Do we have to sneak this alcohol

01:48.081 --> 01:49.082
into the arena?

01:49.082 --> 01:50.083
Oh, shoot...

01:50.083 --> 01:50.917
Can you imagine

01:50.917 --> 01:52.085
getting caught at 34 years old?

01:52.085 --> 01:53.086
That might be sad.

01:53.086 --> 01:54.087
No, we need to pop a nice

01:54.087 --> 01:55.088
bottles of champagne.

01:55.088 --> 01:56.089
We need to shove

01:56.089 --> 01:57.090
champagne in our pants.

01:57.090 --> 01:58.058
Yeah.

01:58.058 --> 01:58.759
People would just be

01:58.759 --> 01:59.526
like, "Brie still hasn't lost

01:59.526 --> 02:00.033
the baby weight."

02:00.033 --> 02:01.001
I'd be like, "Hey, you're right,

02:01.001 --> 02:01.502
bitches."

02:01.502 --> 02:03.469
Or Brie has a.

02:03.469 --> 02:04.270
No, because I wouldn't

02:04.270 --> 02:05.038
put it upside down.

02:05.038 --> 02:05.806
If you put a bott...

02:05.806 --> 02:06.540
Oh, you're gonna put it the

02:06.540 --> 02:07.240
other way, yeah, you look like

02:07.240 --> 02:07.741
you have balls.

02:07.741 --> 02:09.810
So the day has come‐‐

02:09.810 --> 02:11.411
WrestleMania!

02:11.411 --> 02:12.813
And I am just so excited for

02:12.813 --> 02:13.814
tonight.

02:13.814 --> 02:15.549
But it's really tough, because

02:15.549 --> 02:17.216
my passion's wrestling, and I

02:17.216 --> 02:18.351
really want to be back in that

02:18.351 --> 02:20.787
ring competing, and I just hope

02:20.787 --> 02:22.523
that one day I could get back

02:22.523 --> 02:23.690
in there with these women

02:23.690 --> 02:24.958
and have some fun.

02:24.958 --> 02:25.959
WrestleMania 34.

02:25.959 --> 02:26.960
What?

02:26.960 --> 02:27.861
I'm sad we're not in the Battle

02:27.861 --> 02:28.962
Royal, but this is fun.

02:28.962 --> 02:29.963
No, this is fun.

02:29.963 --> 02:30.964
And finally, we get to

02:30.964 --> 02:31.965
have fun.

02:31.965 --> 02:32.966
I know. It's just...

02:32.966 --> 02:33.967
No more work.

02:33.967 --> 02:34.968
We're done.

02:34.968 --> 02:35.969
We're done.

02:35.969 --> 02:36.803
No more Axxess, no

02:36.803 --> 02:37.804
more appearances.

02:37.804 --> 02:38.805
It is fun time.

02:38.805 --> 02:39.806
I know.

02:39.806 --> 02:40.807
And it's Brie mode!

02:40.807 --> 02:41.808
Did you accidentally

02:41.808 --> 02:42.809
summon me?

02:42.809 --> 02:43.810
No, bitch.

02:43.810 --> 02:44.811
Yes, bitch.

02:44.811 --> 02:46.179
We're hanging out.

02:46.179 --> 02:47.514
Actually, Siri, I'm

02:47.514 --> 02:48.515
sure you'll sit and listen to

02:48.515 --> 02:50.951
me.

02:50.951 --> 02:52.085
Uh, no.

02:52.085 --> 02:53.086
All right, no.

02:53.086 --> 02:54.087
Go away, Siri. Go, go.

02:54.087 --> 02:55.355
Bye, Siri.

Tonight is the biggest night of

03:15.381 --> 03:16.617
the year.

03:16.617 --> 03:17.984
Dream matches finally coming to

03:17.984 --> 03:19.252
fruition.

03:19.252 --> 03:20.787
Brand new career path turning

03:20.787 --> 03:23.356
into a gigantic in‐ring debut.

03:23.356 --> 03:25.325
The Yes! Movement, also here,

03:25.325 --> 03:26.660
loves the WWE Universe.

03:26.660 --> 03:27.761
Starting a Riott!

03:27.761 --> 03:28.962
It's getting loud out

03:28.962 --> 03:29.963
there already.

03:29.963 --> 03:31.497
We still have some time to kill.

03:31.497 --> 03:34.568
The clock is ticking.

03:35.569 --> 03:36.703
Brie, ready to arm

03:36.703 --> 03:37.704
wrestle!

03:37.704 --> 03:38.705
Bryan's drink!

03:38.705 --> 03:39.706
Oh! Oh!

03:39.706 --> 03:40.507
That's all Bryan asked

03:40.507 --> 03:41.508
for.

03:41.508 --> 03:42.342
I didn't know you were

03:42.342 --> 03:43.343
holding it.

03:43.343 --> 03:44.177
Well, now I feel bad, like I'm

03:44.177 --> 03:45.078
going to ruin his match and jinx

03:45.078 --> 03:46.079
him.

03:46.079 --> 03:47.080
Kill it.

03:47.080 --> 03:48.515
Thank you.

03:48.515 --> 03:49.883
We are backstage,

03:49.883 --> 03:52.185
and I cannot wait to reveal what

03:52.185 --> 03:54.721
my WrestleMania 34 look is

03:54.721 --> 03:55.722
gonna be.

03:55.722 --> 03:57.591
Today is WrestleMania, and I'm

03:57.591 --> 03:58.592
feeling so excited, because this

03:58.592 --> 03:59.593
is really the biggest

03:59.593 --> 04:01.835
WrestleMania in the history of

04:01.835 --> 04:03.504
the WWE for women.

04:03.504 --> 04:04.505
Right now, the women's

04:04.505 --> 04:06.072
division is just killing it.

04:06.072 --> 04:07.140
And now, we have

04:07.140 --> 04:09.375
four women's matches on this

04:09.375 --> 04:10.410
WrestleMania card.

04:10.410 --> 04:11.545
We have the mixed tag

04:11.545 --> 04:13.379
match with Ronda Rousey.

04:13.379 --> 04:14.615
Two single matches

04:14.615 --> 04:15.582
for each one of our

04:15.582 --> 04:16.249
championships.

04:16.249 --> 04:17.083
And also, the

04:17.083 --> 04:18.918
first‐ever Women's Battle

04:18.918 --> 04:20.019
Royal at WrestleMania.

04:20.019 --> 04:21.421
Having four women's

04:21.421 --> 04:23.256
matches is‐is incredible.

04:23.256 --> 04:24.490
So, it's... it is

04:24.490 --> 04:25.592
very, very cool.

04:25.592 --> 04:26.760
It's a big day for us girls,

04:26.760 --> 04:28.028
and I couldn't be happier.

04:28.028 --> 04:30.030
Yes.

04:30.030 --> 04:30.931
Happy WrestleMania.

04:30.931 --> 04:32.966
This is my entrance tonight.

04:32.966 --> 04:34.968
Sheamus carries me.

04:37.003 --> 04:38.004
It's gonna be insane

04:38.004 --> 04:39.639
with, like, all the butterflies

04:39.639 --> 04:41.975
and before I walk out.

04:41.975 --> 04:43.476
It's like your first

04:43.476 --> 04:44.511
big singles at Mania.

04:44.511 --> 04:45.345
Yeah.

04:45.345 --> 04:46.346
The first one ever.

04:46.346 --> 04:47.413
Yeah, I know.

04:47.413 --> 04:48.982
And maybe last.

04:48.982 --> 04:51.284
I did not sleep a wink last

04:51.284 --> 04:52.218
night at all.

04:52.218 --> 04:53.954
I kept thinking, like, "Oh,

04:53.954 --> 04:55.188
gosh, what if this happens, what

04:55.188 --> 04:56.122
if my gear rips?"

04:56.122 --> 04:58.158
But you know...

04:58.158 --> 04:59.993
today's the big day, and I'm

04:59.993 --> 05:01.167
gonna put my big girl pants on

05:01.167 --> 05:02.836
and go out there and do what I

05:02.836 --> 05:04.938
train to do every single day.

05:04.938 --> 05:06.873
Whoa, look at your

05:06.873 --> 05:08.008
makeup.

05:08.008 --> 05:09.475
Honey Bee!

05:09.475 --> 05:10.877
I just got Honey Bee

05:10.877 --> 05:12.679
glam.

05:12.679 --> 05:14.214
I'm fine.

05:14.214 --> 05:15.348
Hey, Nattie.

05:15.348 --> 05:16.850
Mm.

05:16.850 --> 05:17.851
How are you? Are you good?

05:17.851 --> 05:18.752
Just got into a big

05:18.752 --> 05:19.452
fight with TJ.

05:19.452 --> 05:20.220
Why?

05:20.220 --> 05:21.387
Because he...

05:22.188 --> 05:22.989
I know this‐‐ you're gonna,

05:22.989 --> 05:23.857
you're gonna think this is

05:23.857 --> 05:24.825
crazy, but I thought, "You know,

05:24.825 --> 05:25.759
this is WrestleMania, I might as

05:25.759 --> 05:26.560
well get a little WrestleMania

05:26.560 --> 05:29.730
moment," and I told TJ, and he

05:29.730 --> 05:30.564
goes, "No one cares.

05:30.564 --> 05:31.632
You don't just get compliments

05:31.632 --> 05:34.034
around here," which...

05:34.034 --> 05:35.468
This year at WrestleMania, I'm

05:35.468 --> 05:36.469
gonna be in the first‐ever

05:36.469 --> 05:37.604
Women's Battle Royal.

05:37.604 --> 05:39.272
So it's a big moment.

05:39.272 --> 05:40.874
But for some reason, I've never

05:40.874 --> 05:43.176
felt so unimportant and not

05:43.176 --> 05:45.045
included by my own husband.

05:45.045 --> 05:46.913
I want TJ to make me feel

05:46.913 --> 05:48.549
special, and make me feel like

05:48.549 --> 05:50.951
I'm, like, the most special girl

05:50.951 --> 05:51.785
in the world.

05:51.785 --> 05:53.754
And right now, I'm just feeling

05:53.754 --> 05:55.522
like a fly on the wall.

05:55.522 --> 05:56.757
TJ.

05:56.757 --> 05:58.324
Lick it and stick it, yeah.

05:58.324 --> 05:59.159
How you doing?

05:59.159 --> 05:59.893
I'm good.

05:59.893 --> 06:01.467
What happened, um, with Nattie?

06:01.467 --> 06:02.736
What?

06:02.736 --> 06:03.570
Nattie's mad at you.

06:03.570 --> 06:05.371
Why? What's going on there?

06:05.371 --> 06:06.873
It's just another day.

06:06.873 --> 06:07.708
She's talking about

06:07.708 --> 06:08.975
something about you not liking

06:08.975 --> 06:12.045
her... hey, babe, let's talk

06:12.045 --> 06:13.046
about this real quick.

06:13.046 --> 06:13.980
What's going on?

06:13.980 --> 06:15.148
What don't you like about this?

06:15.148 --> 06:15.949
What?

06:15.949 --> 06:16.950
Nothing, it just, you

06:16.950 --> 06:18.752
hurt my feelings.

06:18.752 --> 06:19.419
On what?

06:19.419 --> 06:21.087
I just wanted to have

06:21.087 --> 06:22.889
a little tiny moment, 'cause

06:22.889 --> 06:24.024
it's WrestleMania.

06:24.024 --> 06:25.058
I understand.

06:25.058 --> 06:26.459
Nattie's obviously

06:26.459 --> 06:27.628
very upset 'cause TJ doesn't

06:27.628 --> 06:28.829
want to listen to her about the

06:28.829 --> 06:29.495
match.

06:29.495 --> 06:31.431
So in good Paige fashion, I like

06:31.431 --> 06:34.334
to get them together and really,

06:34.334 --> 06:35.435
"Let's talk about this."

06:35.435 --> 06:37.203
And you know what?

06:37.203 --> 06:38.539
Terrible idea.

06:38.539 --> 06:39.973
Horrible.

06:39.973 --> 06:41.474
So I'm just gonna back out of

06:41.474 --> 06:42.843
this situation and pretend it

06:42.843 --> 06:46.680
never happened.

06:46.680 --> 06:47.681
Honestly, I'm just

06:47.681 --> 06:48.815
about to burst into tears.

06:48.815 --> 06:50.150
Aw, baby girl, you're

06:50.150 --> 06:51.384
good.

06:51.384 --> 06:53.053
You're fine.

06:53.053 --> 06:54.454
I just feel defeated.

06:54.454 --> 06:55.856
The one person that I need

06:55.856 --> 06:57.390
confidence and support from,

06:57.390 --> 06:59.726
he's spreading himself so thin,

06:59.726 --> 07:01.935
and I feel like I should be his

07:01.935 --> 07:02.769
priority.

07:02.769 --> 07:04.437
I just feel like...

07:07.440 --> 07:08.441
I don't feel like I have very

07:08.441 --> 07:09.543
much confidence right now, and I

07:09.543 --> 07:10.410
need that.

07:10.410 --> 07:11.645
I‐I need all the confidence I

07:11.645 --> 07:12.312
can get.

07:12.312 --> 07:13.313
I'm about to perform in front of

07:13.313 --> 07:14.347
80,000 people.

07:14.347 --> 07:15.849
It's not even that, it's just, I

07:15.849 --> 07:19.185
just want TJ to be supportive.

07:22.556 --> 07:23.557
Welcome to the

07:23.557 --> 07:24.791
greatest event in live

07:24.791 --> 07:27.894
entertainment, WrestleMania.

07:28.829 --> 07:29.663
Wish you were out

07:29.663 --> 07:30.330
there with us.

07:30.330 --> 07:30.997
We did it.

07:30.997 --> 07:31.832
"Why are you not wrestling?"

07:31.832 --> 07:33.399
Oh, you know, just a minor

07:33.399 --> 07:34.100
injury.

07:34.100 --> 07:35.101
Don't worry, I'll be right back.

07:35.101 --> 07:36.269
I know you had to do, like, the

07:36.269 --> 07:37.170
whole speech and stuff like

07:37.170 --> 07:37.671
that.

07:37.671 --> 07:38.171
Yeah.

07:38.171 --> 07:38.905
Well, I have to do it

07:38.905 --> 07:39.405
tomorrow.

07:39.405 --> 07:41.742
Oh, no.

07:41.742 --> 07:42.743
It's about to become

07:42.743 --> 07:44.110
reality.

07:44.110 --> 07:47.581
Oh, wow!

07:47.581 --> 07:48.982
Really? Really?

07:48.982 --> 07:51.084
Holy crap.

07:51.084 --> 07:53.053
Oh,.

07:53.053 --> 07:55.088
Can we have anything drop down

07:55.088 --> 07:56.757
on me before I go out in my

07:56.757 --> 07:58.358
first‐ever WrestleMania singles

07:58.358 --> 07:59.159
match?

08:11.244 --> 08:12.679
I just want TJ to be

08:12.679 --> 08:15.582
supportive.

08:15.582 --> 08:16.917
It's like he's in this new role,

08:16.917 --> 08:19.653
and he's just, like, very blunt.

08:19.653 --> 08:20.386
It's like, you can't...

08:20.386 --> 08:21.121
Oh, he's like,

08:21.121 --> 08:22.088
he's‐he's being too much like

08:22.088 --> 08:23.089
the boss and not your husband

08:23.089 --> 08:23.590
anymore?

08:23.590 --> 08:24.424
Yeah, you can't be

08:24.424 --> 08:25.091
blunt with me.

08:25.091 --> 08:26.226
I want you to be nice to me.

08:26.226 --> 08:27.127
Yeah.

08:27.127 --> 08:28.228
Like...

08:28.228 --> 08:29.830
I think I just... I just feel so

08:29.830 --> 08:31.798
insignificant.

08:31.798 --> 08:32.465
You are not

08:32.465 --> 08:33.466
insignificant.

08:33.466 --> 08:35.135
The one person that I

08:35.135 --> 08:36.469
really need to believe in me,

08:36.469 --> 08:37.837
like, I need TJ to go, "You know

08:37.837 --> 08:38.505
what?

08:38.505 --> 08:39.873
You look great, you, you're

08:39.873 --> 08:41.073
amazing."

08:41.073 --> 08:42.775
It's like, I want to, I want to

08:42.775 --> 08:44.611
be excited, 'cause I am a part

08:44.611 --> 08:45.646
of WrestleMania.

08:45.646 --> 08:46.446
Yes, you are.

08:46.446 --> 08:47.313
And, you know, it's‐‐

08:47.313 --> 08:48.649
I feel awful for‐I've felt awful

08:48.649 --> 08:51.017
for you all week, because I know

08:51.017 --> 08:52.753
how much it has to hurt just to

08:52.753 --> 08:53.687
not be able to do this.

08:53.687 --> 08:54.521
But baby girl, like,

08:54.521 --> 08:55.889
y‐you can't worry about me.

08:55.889 --> 08:56.890
If you've got problems, you're,

08:56.890 --> 08:57.891
you can talk to me about them.

08:57.891 --> 09:00.634
You know that.

09:00.634 --> 09:01.702
I feel bad now that

09:01.702 --> 09:02.936
I'm crying in front of Paige

09:02.936 --> 09:04.004
because she's not even gonna be

09:04.004 --> 09:04.938
a part of the show.

09:04.938 --> 09:06.472
Maybe I am overreacting, and

09:06.472 --> 09:08.108
maybe I didn't realize how hard

09:08.108 --> 09:09.610
it would be for TJ and I to work

09:09.610 --> 09:10.711
together.

09:10.711 --> 09:12.746
And this role for TJ, it's so

09:12.746 --> 09:17.250
hard because TJ, he probably

09:17.250 --> 09:18.519
wants to still compete, too,

09:18.519 --> 09:20.887
just like Paige.

09:20.887 --> 09:21.555
TJ's busy.

09:21.555 --> 09:23.023
He's got a thousand different

09:23.023 --> 09:23.957
matches, a thousand different

09:23.957 --> 09:24.625
people.

09:24.625 --> 09:26.492
He doesn't need to come up to

09:26.492 --> 09:27.327
you and tell you you're

09:27.327 --> 09:28.161
confident every single day.

09:28.161 --> 09:29.495
You know, that's you, baby girl,

09:29.495 --> 09:30.664
and you need to feel that you

09:30.664 --> 09:31.665
are confident, you are

09:31.665 --> 09:32.332
beautiful.

09:32.332 --> 09:33.133
And guess what?

09:33.133 --> 09:34.134
You get to go out on the

09:34.134 --> 09:35.468
grandest stage of them all at

09:35.468 --> 09:36.570
WrestleMania.

09:36.570 --> 09:38.905
I‐I don't, but I get to, like,

09:38.905 --> 09:39.706
live vicariously through you.

09:39.706 --> 09:40.541
You know what I mean?

09:40.541 --> 09:41.241
You're right.

09:41.241 --> 09:41.908
You're absolutely right.

09:41.908 --> 09:42.709
And you, you are

09:42.709 --> 09:43.644
absolutely incredible, dude.

09:43.644 --> 09:44.310
You're amazing.

09:44.310 --> 09:44.978
Thanks, Paige.

09:44.978 --> 09:45.879
And I'm gonna be‐‐ I'm

09:45.879 --> 09:46.680
so excited to watch you.

09:46.680 --> 09:48.414
Like, you stand out, you know?

09:48.414 --> 09:51.084
You have to be confident.

09:51.084 --> 09:54.555
Thank you.

Kick ass.

10:33.800 --> 10:34.935
It just still blows my

10:34.935 --> 10:36.169
mind that, like, this is where I

10:36.169 --> 10:37.237
made my debut and this is where

10:37.237 --> 10:37.904
you make your debut.

10:37.904 --> 10:38.572
That's weird.

10:38.572 --> 10:39.305
Isn't that crazy?

10:39.305 --> 10:40.073
Like, that's, like,

10:40.073 --> 10:41.374
weird, like, real life full

10:41.374 --> 10:42.042
circle.

10:42.042 --> 10:42.543
Yeah.

10:42.543 --> 10:43.476
I'm just like, I don't

10:43.476 --> 10:44.377
know what emotion I feel right

10:44.377 --> 10:44.878
now.

10:44.878 --> 10:46.212
And, like, part of me's nervous.

10:46.212 --> 10:47.380
Part of me's just, like,

10:47.380 --> 10:48.682
emotionless, because it's just,

10:48.682 --> 10:49.916
like, so much has been happening

10:49.916 --> 10:50.416
this week.

10:50.416 --> 10:50.917
Yeah.

10:50.917 --> 10:51.752
You're gonna be making history

10:51.752 --> 10:52.753
tonight, baby girl, whether

10:52.753 --> 10:53.754
you're out first or last.

10:53.754 --> 10:55.355
First openly lesbian

10:55.355 --> 10:56.557
female in WWE to perform at

10:56.557 --> 10:57.423
WrestleMania.

10:57.423 --> 10:58.158
Yay!

10:58.158 --> 11:00.066
Pretty cool, right?

11:00.066 --> 11:01.234
It's WrestleMania, and

11:01.234 --> 11:02.468
I get to do commentary‐‐

11:02.468 --> 11:04.505
for the girls' battle royal‐‐

11:04.505 --> 11:05.471
which is really cool.

11:05.471 --> 11:06.707
Like, I'm so happy I get to be a

11:06.707 --> 11:07.674
part of it.

11:07.674 --> 11:09.275
But it's just like, there's no

11:09.275 --> 11:10.476
reason why I have to try and

11:10.476 --> 11:11.477
keep a big smile on my face.

11:11.477 --> 11:12.312
It's like, "Yay."

11:12.312 --> 11:13.113
They're like, "Why are you not

11:13.113 --> 11:13.780
wrestling?"

11:13.780 --> 11:14.715
And I'm like, "Oh, you know,

11:14.715 --> 11:15.649
just a minor injury.

11:15.649 --> 11:16.482
Don't worry, I'll be right

11:16.482 --> 11:17.417
back."

11:17.417 --> 11:18.118
I wish you were out

11:18.118 --> 11:18.785
there with us.

11:18.785 --> 11:19.452
We did it.

11:19.452 --> 11:20.353
I'll be there. You be awesome.

11:20.353 --> 11:21.287
Thank you.

11:21.287 --> 11:22.088
I'm so proud of you.

11:22.088 --> 11:22.889
Thanks, sister.

11:22.889 --> 11:23.690
Thanks for everything.

11:23.690 --> 11:24.525
Yeah.

11:34.668 --> 11:35.536
Ladies and

11:35.536 --> 11:38.605
gentlemen, please welcome Daniel

11:38.605 --> 11:40.641
Bryan!

11:40.641 --> 11:41.842
Bryan is about to have

11:41.842 --> 11:44.477
the most amazing comeback ever.

11:44.477 --> 11:46.012
Bryan, to me, is

11:46.012 --> 11:47.814
the definition of hope.

11:47.814 --> 11:49.349
Three years ago, this was taken

11:49.349 --> 11:50.350
from him.

11:50.350 --> 11:51.618
And he never gave up, and he

11:51.618 --> 11:54.087
fought so hard, and now he's

11:54.087 --> 11:55.956
back in that ring, and I have to

11:55.956 --> 11:58.291
say it's quite exciting.

12:03.136 --> 12:04.705
The Yes! Movement

12:04.705 --> 12:06.740
is alive and well in the

12:06.740 --> 12:09.209
Superdome.

12:09.209 --> 12:11.612
The yes lock on Sami Zayn.

12:11.612 --> 12:12.913
Sami Zayn...

12:21.955 --> 12:22.689
Hey, guys.

12:22.689 --> 12:23.489
Congratulations, dude.

12:23.489 --> 12:24.424
Thank you very much.

12:24.424 --> 12:25.325
I want to give you a

12:25.325 --> 12:26.226
big hug, oh, my goodness.

12:26.226 --> 12:26.960
Thank you.

12:26.960 --> 12:27.761
Sit right here, Paige,

12:27.761 --> 12:28.595
I'm gonna grab something really

12:28.595 --> 12:29.395
quick.

12:29.395 --> 12:30.296
Sorry, I know you feel

12:30.296 --> 12:31.097
like you've been overwhelmed

12:31.097 --> 12:32.432
with stuff right now.

12:32.432 --> 12:33.099
Yeah.

12:33.099 --> 12:33.767
Probably because,

12:33.767 --> 12:34.500
like, you've had your first

12:34.500 --> 12:35.168
match back, especially after

12:35.168 --> 12:35.836
two years of being out.

12:35.836 --> 12:36.503
Three years.

12:36.503 --> 12:37.504
Three years!

12:37.504 --> 12:38.338
Three years, yeah.

12:38.338 --> 12:39.305
Three.

12:39.305 --> 12:40.173
Oh, my goodness.

12:40.173 --> 12:41.007
Three years of being out.

12:41.007 --> 12:41.942
It's been that long, really?

12:41.942 --> 12:42.909
Yeah.

12:42.909 --> 12:43.810
How do you feel?

12:43.810 --> 12:45.111
I mean, it was

12:45.111 --> 12:46.847
awesome, you know what I mean?

12:46.847 --> 12:47.648
'Cause I know you had

12:47.648 --> 12:48.348
to do, like, the whole speech

12:48.348 --> 12:49.015
and stuff like that.

12:49.015 --> 12:49.516
Yeah.

12:49.516 --> 12:50.250
Well, I have to do it

12:50.250 --> 12:50.751
tomorrow.

12:50.751 --> 12:51.451
Oh, no.

12:51.451 --> 12:52.218
How do you write

12:52.218 --> 12:53.153
something and say good‐bye to

12:53.153 --> 12:54.254
something you love, you know?

12:54.254 --> 12:55.355
I really tried to

12:55.355 --> 12:57.858
focus not on poor me, because I

12:57.858 --> 12:59.092
don't... I never wanted to be

12:59.092 --> 13:01.167
remembered as "poor me."

13:01.167 --> 13:03.504
I'm very proud of my career.

13:03.504 --> 13:04.705
Right? I'm very proud of what I

13:04.705 --> 13:05.706
did.

13:05.706 --> 13:07.608
And you come from a wrestling

13:07.608 --> 13:09.576
family who has worked their

13:09.576 --> 13:12.679
asses off in wrestling for years

13:12.679 --> 13:14.414
and years and years, and none of

13:14.414 --> 13:16.617
them ever got to be a part of

13:16.617 --> 13:17.784
WWE.

13:17.784 --> 13:18.752
And as hard as it is to say

13:18.752 --> 13:20.153
good‐bye, you've gotten to do

13:20.153 --> 13:21.788
some amazing things at 26 years

13:21.788 --> 13:22.923
old.

13:22.923 --> 13:24.858
People focus so much on the

13:24.858 --> 13:26.192
negative, but if you can just

13:26.192 --> 13:27.427
flip it around and think of all

13:27.427 --> 13:28.762
the amazing people that you've

13:28.762 --> 13:29.996
met and the amazing

13:29.996 --> 13:31.131
opportunities that you've gotten

13:31.131 --> 13:32.232
to do...

13:32.232 --> 13:33.166
Bryan's like a modern

13:33.166 --> 13:34.200
day superhero.

13:34.200 --> 13:35.702
Like, it's amazing, like, you

13:35.702 --> 13:36.903
know, coming back from a

13:36.903 --> 13:37.938
career‐ending injury.

13:37.938 --> 13:39.305
Like, he was done, but he didn't

13:39.305 --> 13:40.440
give up.

13:40.440 --> 13:41.508
Sometimes it really does give me

13:41.508 --> 13:42.408
hope, even though I know it's a

13:42.408 --> 13:43.376
different injury to mine, but,

13:43.376 --> 13:44.110
like, just seeing that, I'm

13:44.110 --> 13:46.613
like, miracles can happen.

13:46.613 --> 13:48.782
Maybe my neck will just heal...

13:48.782 --> 13:50.250
after a year.

13:50.250 --> 13:52.452
One can only hope.

13:52.452 --> 13:53.554
Tomorrow will be

13:53.554 --> 13:54.621
hard.

13:54.621 --> 13:55.421
You gotta focus on the positive

13:55.421 --> 13:56.222
things.

13:56.222 --> 13:56.990
Thank you guys so

13:56.990 --> 13:57.824
much, I appreciate it.

13:57.824 --> 13:58.559
Aw, we love you, Paige.

13:58.559 --> 13:59.259
I really appreciate

13:59.259 --> 14:00.026
it, Bryan.

14:00.026 --> 14:00.634
Yeah.

14:00.634 --> 14:01.301
Good luck tomorrow.

14:01.301 --> 14:02.569
Thank you.

14:05.972 --> 14:07.240
Happy WrestleMania.

14:07.240 --> 14:08.775
Oh, if it isn't...

14:08.775 --> 14:09.910
Not even.

14:09.910 --> 14:11.044
TJ.

14:11.044 --> 14:12.579
Oh, how are you?

14:12.579 --> 14:13.714
Look how handsome you look.

14:13.714 --> 14:14.715
I know.

14:14.715 --> 14:15.749
You look so sharp.

14:15.749 --> 14:16.683
We're looking for your

14:16.683 --> 14:17.483
wife.

14:17.483 --> 14:18.484
Good old Natalya is

14:18.484 --> 14:19.920
getting angry because she says I

14:19.920 --> 14:22.022
keep putting over the Raw girls.

14:22.022 --> 14:22.923
How are we gonna calm

14:22.923 --> 14:23.757
her down?

14:23.757 --> 14:24.625
How are you gonna calm her

14:24.625 --> 14:27.694
down?

14:27.694 --> 14:29.029
I totally feel like

14:29.029 --> 14:30.130
men sometimes don't realize

14:30.130 --> 14:31.865
how easy it is to fix this.

14:31.865 --> 14:33.934
Like, just compliment her.

14:33.934 --> 14:35.068
I think for women it's more

14:35.068 --> 14:36.570
about the little things, and

14:36.570 --> 14:37.738
when you do the little things

14:37.738 --> 14:39.239
for us, it just goes such a long

14:39.239 --> 14:40.206
way.

14:40.206 --> 14:41.742
If you do little reminders of,

14:41.742 --> 14:42.843
like, how much you love her,

14:42.843 --> 14:44.210
'cause us girls are like that...

14:44.210 --> 14:45.478
Maybe I'll have to

14:45.478 --> 14:46.613
revert back to my old ways...

14:46.613 --> 14:47.614
Yes.

14:47.614 --> 14:48.348
...just so she calms

14:48.348 --> 14:49.082
down a little.

14:49.082 --> 14:49.883
Back to the‐‐

14:49.883 --> 14:50.717
I think what it is, Nattie just

14:50.717 --> 14:51.852
needs to know that she's the

14:51.852 --> 14:53.353
number one superstar in your

14:53.353 --> 14:54.387
heart.

14:54.387 --> 14:55.589
Gotcha. Makes sense.

14:55.589 --> 14:56.256
Yeah.

14:56.256 --> 14:57.457
It's good advice.

14:57.457 --> 14:58.659
Thanks for the talk, guys.

14:58.659 --> 14:59.526
Oh, TJ, you're

14:59.526 --> 15:00.300
welcome.

15:00.300 --> 15:01.234
>> TJ. Thanks for the talk.

15:01.234 --> 15:02.135
I can't wait to see

15:02.135 --> 15:02.969
what you do for Nattie.

15:02.969 --> 15:04.137
I know. Bye.

15:04.137 --> 15:05.238
It'll be good.

15:05.238 --> 15:06.540
It will, I bet.

15:06.540 --> 15:07.974
Baby girl...

15:07.974 --> 15:09.910
Didn't IME do a good job?

15:09.910 --> 15:10.911
It looks so arty.

15:10.911 --> 15:12.012
How are you, glitter

15:12.012 --> 15:12.846
tits?

15:12.846 --> 15:13.680
I know, and I need

15:13.680 --> 15:14.515
more, because I keep hugging

15:14.515 --> 15:15.415
people.

15:15.415 --> 15:16.316
They're taking it off of me.

15:16.316 --> 15:17.117
Get them glitter tits

15:17.117 --> 15:17.951
in.

15:17.951 --> 15:18.919
It's so weird just

15:18.919 --> 15:19.820
coming, not doing anything.

15:19.820 --> 15:21.354
You're here to support?

15:21.354 --> 15:23.423
Yeah. You excited?

15:26.426 --> 15:27.427
Nia needs to‐‐

15:27.427 --> 15:28.361
Especially tonight, Nia needs to

15:28.361 --> 15:29.229
to do what brought her to the

15:29.229 --> 15:30.330
dance, and that is being

15:30.330 --> 15:31.364
herself.

15:31.364 --> 15:32.666
I know.

15:32.666 --> 15:33.867
You are one of a kind,

15:33.867 --> 15:34.735
girly.

15:34.735 --> 15:35.536
One of a kind?

15:35.536 --> 15:37.003
One of a kind.

15:37.003 --> 15:38.071
I am very confident, and

15:38.071 --> 15:39.472
I show a very confident face,

15:39.472 --> 15:40.541
but sometimes there's some

15:40.541 --> 15:41.908
insecurity that creeps in.

15:41.908 --> 15:44.010
And being in this division, I'm

15:44.010 --> 15:45.612
constantly reminded of how I am

15:45.612 --> 15:46.613
totally different from every

15:46.613 --> 15:47.881
girl that we have.

15:47.881 --> 15:50.183
You know, I am the bigger girl.

15:50.183 --> 15:51.317
It's something that I've dealt

15:51.317 --> 15:52.385
with my whole life is body

15:52.385 --> 15:53.219
image.

15:53.219 --> 15:54.120
And I love Nicole for trying to

15:54.120 --> 15:55.155
make me feel better and, you

15:55.155 --> 15:56.189
know, letting me know there is

15:56.189 --> 15:57.691
only one me in this division.

15:57.691 --> 16:00.734
But, you know, that little

16:00.734 --> 16:01.902
insecurity's creeping in because

16:01.902 --> 16:04.004
we have 80,000 people out there

16:04.004 --> 16:06.439
waiting for us to go out and put

16:06.439 --> 16:09.175
on a great show, and I just hope

16:09.175 --> 16:11.578
I can deliver.

16:11.578 --> 16:13.647
Uh, uh... we'll see.

16:17.250 --> 16:18.384
We can kick ass just as

16:18.384 --> 16:20.120
much as the guys can.

16:20.120 --> 16:21.622
I'd love to kick some guy's ass.

16:21.622 --> 16:23.690
The first‐ever

16:23.690 --> 16:27.761
WrestleMania Women's Battle

16:27.761 --> 16:30.096
Royal!

16:30.096 --> 16:31.164
It is go time.

16:31.164 --> 16:32.098
I need to let whatever happened

16:32.098 --> 16:33.266
with TJ go.

16:33.266 --> 16:34.601
Oh, no... No!

16:34.601 --> 16:36.670
Uh‐oh.

16:42.275 --> 16:43.877
If a man can do it,

16:43.877 --> 16:45.311
a woman can do it.

16:45.311 --> 16:46.647
This women's

16:46.647 --> 16:47.981
revolution is something that's

16:47.981 --> 16:48.915
only continuing.

16:48.915 --> 16:50.150
We're breaking barriers

16:50.150 --> 16:50.917
of what people thought we

16:50.917 --> 16:51.652
could do.

16:51.652 --> 16:52.586
We are hitting our

16:52.586 --> 16:54.087
stride, and it feels great.

16:54.087 --> 16:55.355
We have just begun.

16:55.355 --> 16:56.422
There are so many more things

16:56.422 --> 16:57.490
that we can achieve.

16:57.490 --> 16:58.892
And we can kick ass just

16:58.892 --> 17:00.266
as much as the guys can.

17:00.266 --> 17:01.401
I would love to kick some guy's

17:01.401 --> 17:02.669
ass.

17:02.669 --> 17:04.838
And now, the

17:04.838 --> 17:08.340
following is the first‐ever

17:08.340 --> 17:12.546
WrestleMania Women's Battle

17:12.546 --> 17:15.882
Royal!

17:15.882 --> 17:17.617
This WrestleMania is

17:17.617 --> 17:19.419
so historic for women.

17:19.419 --> 17:20.420
It's the first time

17:20.420 --> 17:22.255
that there's been four matches

17:22.255 --> 17:23.690
where women are featured.

17:23.690 --> 17:25.058
The Women's Battle

17:25.058 --> 17:26.792
Royal is where 20 girls are

17:26.792 --> 17:28.762
competing in the ring, and

17:28.762 --> 17:30.230
whoever is the last girl

17:30.230 --> 17:32.298
remaining is the winner.

17:34.868 --> 17:35.869
And it is our

17:35.869 --> 17:36.837
pleasure to add another special

17:36.837 --> 17:38.238
guest commentator tonight.

17:38.238 --> 17:40.273
From Absolution, Paige.

17:40.273 --> 17:41.207
Welcome.

17:41.207 --> 17:42.175
My gosh, she looks so

17:42.175 --> 17:42.909
good.

17:42.909 --> 17:43.877
She does.

17:43.877 --> 17:44.578
You are

17:44.578 --> 17:45.445
injured, you will not be

17:45.445 --> 17:46.179
involved in the battle royal

17:46.179 --> 17:47.013
tonight, but you're out here to

17:47.013 --> 17:47.881
give us your expertise.

17:47.881 --> 17:48.715
Right, yeah.

17:48.715 --> 17:51.785
Hopefully next year. Yes.

17:55.421 --> 17:56.723
It's kind of bittersweet

17:56.723 --> 17:58.491
because I couldn't be prouder of

17:58.491 --> 17:59.492
the women's division just

17:59.492 --> 18:01.234
because... look how many matches

18:01.234 --> 18:02.636
we have on the card.

18:02.636 --> 18:03.870
But, like, that makes me feel

18:03.870 --> 18:05.639
really sad, and I so wish I

18:05.639 --> 18:06.607
could be a part of it, but I'm

18:06.607 --> 18:07.941
not, unfortunately.

18:10.744 --> 18:11.878
Natalya told me

18:11.878 --> 18:13.179
today that the jacket and outfit

18:13.179 --> 18:15.782
she's wearing has over 15,000

18:15.782 --> 18:17.017
crystals.

18:17.017 --> 18:18.184
Yeah, the cost of a

18:18.184 --> 18:19.252
costume like that, I'm sure poor

18:19.252 --> 18:20.386
TJ is going to be eating cat

18:20.386 --> 18:21.354
food for the next month,

18:21.354 --> 18:22.889
unfortunately.

18:22.889 --> 18:24.558
It is go time.

18:24.558 --> 18:25.526
I need to let whatever happened

18:25.526 --> 18:26.727
with TJ go.

18:26.727 --> 18:27.994
I need to focus on this match, I

18:27.994 --> 18:29.262
need to be there for the girls.

18:29.262 --> 18:30.564
I know TJ's under stress, I know

18:30.564 --> 18:31.732
I'm under stress.

18:31.732 --> 18:33.299
I know that the 20 girls in the

18:33.299 --> 18:34.868
match are all under stress.

18:34.868 --> 18:37.237
And it's just time to let it all

18:37.237 --> 18:37.904
go.

18:37.904 --> 18:38.639
And that's Miss

18:38.639 --> 18:40.073
"Money in the Bank" Carmella.

18:40.073 --> 18:41.241
Look what I got,

18:41.241 --> 18:41.742
baby!

18:41.742 --> 18:44.511
I got all this cash, baby!

18:48.749 --> 18:49.415
Oh, wait...

18:49.415 --> 18:50.383
Women teaming up to

18:50.383 --> 18:52.285
eliminate Carmella.

18:52.986 --> 18:54.154
Like a pack of wolves.

18:55.188 --> 18:56.990
What a kick.

18:56.990 --> 18:57.658
Bye‐bye.

18:57.658 --> 18:58.491
Carmella's

18:58.491 --> 19:00.867
eliminated.

19:00.867 --> 19:02.102
Uh‐oh.

19:10.010 --> 19:13.046
The energy is crazy.

19:13.046 --> 19:14.180
This is a history‐making moment.

19:14.180 --> 19:15.816
This is a history‐making match.

19:15.816 --> 19:16.950
And you don't have to get

19:16.950 --> 19:18.051
pinned, you actually have to

19:18.051 --> 19:19.553
throw the other person over the

19:19.553 --> 19:20.353
top rope.

19:20.353 --> 19:21.487
The last woman left in the ring

19:21.487 --> 19:22.723
wins, and that's who gets the

19:22.723 --> 19:23.489
bragging rights.

19:23.489 --> 19:25.258
And, uh...

19:25.258 --> 19:27.694
I'm trying to win.

19:27.694 --> 19:29.029
Oh, no!

19:29.029 --> 19:31.497
Mandy Rose eliminated.

19:42.576 --> 19:44.310
450!

19:44.310 --> 19:45.145
The Women's Battle

19:45.145 --> 19:46.980
Royal, it's really intense.

19:46.980 --> 19:48.715
There's so many of us girls in

19:48.715 --> 19:50.684
this ring at the same time.

19:50.684 --> 19:52.152
There's just so much happening,

19:52.152 --> 19:53.353
and I just want to make sure

19:53.353 --> 19:56.557
that I do a really good job.

20:01.234 --> 20:03.069
Good power by Natalya.

20:03.069 --> 20:06.573
Double suplex.

20:06.573 --> 20:08.441
And Lana eliminated.

20:08.441 --> 20:11.111
Oh! And right in the face.

20:11.111 --> 20:14.180
Yeah!

20:16.683 --> 20:18.051
And Natalya

20:18.051 --> 20:19.720
celebrating, but the Riott Squad

20:19.720 --> 20:21.487
making names for themselves here

20:21.487 --> 20:23.590
tonight.

20:23.590 --> 20:25.391
Team up to eliminate

20:25.391 --> 20:27.427
Natalya.

20:27.427 --> 20:29.530
And there goes Ruby Riott.

20:29.530 --> 20:32.666
And Sarah Logan.

20:32.666 --> 20:35.569
Sasha Banks eliminated by

20:35.569 --> 20:36.570
Bayley.

20:36.570 --> 20:38.304
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

20:38.304 --> 20:39.773
Naomi was never

20:39.773 --> 20:41.307
eliminated.

20:41.307 --> 20:44.578
Never went over the top rope.

20:44.578 --> 20:45.946
Oh, clear view.

20:45.946 --> 20:47.848
Oh!

20:47.848 --> 20:49.049
Trin!

20:49.049 --> 20:50.050
And Naomi from

20:50.050 --> 20:52.553
SmackDown Livetakes out Bayley

20:52.553 --> 20:53.887
from <i>Raw.</i>

20:53.887 --> 20:55.756
Naomi wins the inaugural Women's

20:55.756 --> 20:57.357
Battle Royal.

21:01.968 --> 21:03.203
This is a huge

21:03.203 --> 21:05.038
defining moment for me.

21:05.038 --> 21:06.439
I feel like a lot of girls have

21:06.439 --> 21:08.609
had special moments and their

21:08.609 --> 21:10.811
time to make history, and now I

21:10.811 --> 21:13.079
have officially made history.

21:13.079 --> 21:15.115
Yes!

21:15.115 --> 21:16.449
Glow has been felt.

21:16.449 --> 21:17.450
Trin!

21:17.450 --> 21:18.384
If no one remembers

21:18.384 --> 21:20.621
anything else, they will

21:20.621 --> 21:21.922
remember that Naomi won the

21:21.922 --> 21:23.957
first‐ever WrestleMania Women's

21:23.957 --> 21:24.791
Battle Royal.

21:24.791 --> 21:26.292
No one can take that away from

21:26.292 --> 21:28.394
me.

21:28.394 --> 21:31.097
Congratulations to

21:31.097 --> 21:32.265
Naomi.

21:37.337 --> 21:38.505
Whoa!

21:38.505 --> 21:40.641
Oh, yeah!

21:40.641 --> 21:43.076
Oh, Trin!

21:43.076 --> 21:44.344
My cheeks hurt from

21:44.344 --> 21:45.946
smiling so much and being so

21:45.946 --> 21:46.947
excited.

21:46.947 --> 21:49.482
It's‐it's just...

21:49.482 --> 21:52.719
It's really special tonight.

21:52.719 --> 21:54.387
Um, I feel like we had a lot of

21:54.387 --> 21:55.388
historic and history‐making

21:55.388 --> 21:57.490
moments this year.

21:57.490 --> 21:58.525
I'm just, I'm just

21:58.525 --> 21:59.526
excited.

21:59.526 --> 22:01.735
Like, it's really, really cool.

22:01.735 --> 22:03.369
I hate crying! Gosh!

22:03.369 --> 22:05.171
And I never cry!

22:05.171 --> 22:06.372
Good time to be a woman right

22:06.372 --> 22:08.208
now, especially in this company.

22:08.208 --> 22:09.209
That's right.

22:09.209 --> 22:10.210
You made us all feel the glow

22:10.210 --> 22:11.778
and congratulations to you.

22:11.778 --> 22:14.681
You deserve it more than anyone.

22:17.150 --> 22:18.652
This is my heart, this

22:18.652 --> 22:21.655
is my soul and this is my blood.

22:21.655 --> 22:22.956
I don't want to say good‐bye,

22:22.956 --> 22:25.258
but Bryan did it so I can do it,

22:25.258 --> 22:26.426
too.

22:27.761 --> 22:29.095
It kind of felt like I

22:29.095 --> 22:30.096
needed to clean up Nattie's

22:30.096 --> 22:31.665
mistake a little bit.

22:31.665 --> 22:33.233
As president, this all goes on

22:33.233 --> 22:34.234
my shoulders.

22:34.234 --> 22:35.068
They were promised

22:35.068 --> 22:36.336
something that was untrue and it

22:36.336 --> 22:38.572
didn't get delivered.

22:38.572 --> 22:40.450
Here we go.

22:50.483 --> 22:53.253
Four, three, two...!

22:53.253 --> 22:54.921
I got a surprise for you.

22:54.921 --> 22:56.489
Oh, my God.

22:56.489 --> 22:57.490
You say that I'm never

22:57.490 --> 22:58.291
proud of you, but that's not

22:58.291 --> 22:58.959
true.

22:58.959 --> 23:00.000
I couldn't be more proud of you.

23:00.000 --> 23:02.002
Oh, my God! TJ!

23:02.002 --> 23:03.136
I got you a little card.

23:03.136 --> 23:04.137
I figured it's the only way you

23:04.137 --> 23:05.639
could enjoy this match, so...

23:08.274 --> 23:11.111
Oh, my God!

23:11.111 --> 23:12.178
That's sweet of you.

23:12.178 --> 23:12.979
It's the only way I could

23:12.979 --> 23:13.980
enjoy this match.

23:13.980 --> 23:15.048
Aw, "T."

23:15.048 --> 23:16.049
I'm always proud of you.

23:16.049 --> 23:16.817
Thank you.

23:16.817 --> 23:17.483
Did you think we did okay

23:17.483 --> 23:18.318
tonight?

23:18.318 --> 23:20.020
Yeah, very good.

23:20.020 --> 23:21.421
You're the best.

23:21.421 --> 23:23.957
After the match, TJ surprises me

23:23.957 --> 23:25.125
with flowers.

23:25.125 --> 23:26.459
I wasn't expecting that because

23:26.459 --> 23:27.594
everything at WrestleMania is so

23:27.594 --> 23:29.495
hectic and intense and crazy.

23:29.495 --> 23:30.496
Get a little spoiled every now

23:30.496 --> 23:31.164
and then.

23:31.164 --> 23:32.165
I know. That was sweet.

23:32.165 --> 23:34.167
This is Nicole style.

23:34.167 --> 23:35.168
But for TJ to go out of his way

23:35.168 --> 23:37.270
and to surprise me with flowers

23:37.270 --> 23:39.773
and this beautiful card, it

23:39.773 --> 23:41.508
really reminds me of how special

23:41.508 --> 23:43.544
TJ is and how much TJ does love

23:43.544 --> 23:45.211
me.

23:45.211 --> 23:46.780
Um, I don't know what

23:46.780 --> 23:48.014
match is next.

23:48.014 --> 23:49.049
Oh, this one is next.

23:49.049 --> 23:50.083
Yeah, it's next.

23:50.083 --> 23:51.051
Cool.

23:51.051 --> 23:51.818
Oh, I can't wait to see this,

23:51.818 --> 23:52.318
actually.

23:52.318 --> 23:53.019
This is gonna be awesome.

23:53.019 --> 23:53.720
Me, too.

23:53.720 --> 23:55.055
Ronda Rousey's match is about to

23:55.055 --> 23:56.256
start and I have to admit, I am

23:56.256 --> 23:57.724
so curious.

23:57.724 --> 23:59.693
Like, this has been a massive

23:59.693 --> 24:01.101
buildup and I want to know how

24:01.101 --> 24:02.035
she's gonna wrestle.

24:02.035 --> 24:03.504
Like, are we gonna see the Ronda

24:03.504 --> 24:05.839
that we have seen main event at

24:05.839 --> 24:06.840
UFC?

24:06.840 --> 24:08.474
Are we gonna get that Ronda here

24:08.474 --> 24:10.476
at WrestleMania in the WWE ring?

24:10.476 --> 24:11.845
It's about to

24:11.845 --> 24:13.580
become reality.

24:13.580 --> 24:14.815
Wow.

24:14.815 --> 24:15.649
Making her

24:15.649 --> 24:17.250
way to the ring, the baddest

24:17.250 --> 24:22.455
woman on the planet, Rowdy

24:22.455 --> 24:26.927
Ronda Rousey!

24:26.927 --> 24:27.928
She's in

24:27.928 --> 24:29.295
unbelievable shape.

24:29.996 --> 24:30.697
Ronda Rousey

24:30.697 --> 24:31.598
couldn't have picked a bigger

24:31.598 --> 24:32.933
fish to challenge for her first

24:32.933 --> 24:33.934
match.

24:33.934 --> 24:34.935
It's like showing up to

24:34.935 --> 24:36.269
basketball camp your first day

24:36.269 --> 24:37.804
and having to face LeBron James

24:37.804 --> 24:39.472
and Pat Riley.

24:39.472 --> 24:40.907
Nerves have to be immense

24:40.907 --> 24:41.908
tonight.

24:41.908 --> 24:43.710
Three, two, one, go!

24:43.710 --> 24:44.711
There's Ronda

24:44.711 --> 24:45.712
Rousey!

24:45.712 --> 24:47.681
Oh, wow!

24:47.681 --> 24:48.915
Whoa!

24:48.915 --> 24:50.584
Holy.

24:52.753 --> 24:53.754
Rousey's in

24:53.754 --> 24:55.121
fight mode!

24:55.121 --> 24:56.389
She is amazing.

24:56.389 --> 24:58.024
Sick.

24:58.024 --> 25:00.500
Oh! Oh, my God!

25:00.500 --> 25:02.202
The badass.

25:02.202 --> 25:03.303
Rousey must be

25:03.303 --> 25:04.337
out of her mind.

25:04.337 --> 25:06.172
Ronda Rousey is squaring off

25:06.172 --> 25:07.741
with Triple H!

25:07.741 --> 25:08.875
Shut up!

25:08.875 --> 25:10.043
Oh, my God.

25:10.043 --> 25:11.211
What is happening right now?

25:11.211 --> 25:12.212
You've got to be

25:12.212 --> 25:15.148
kidding me!

25:15.148 --> 25:16.282
In her in‐ring

25:16.282 --> 25:18.251
debut night at WrestleMania,

25:18.251 --> 25:19.485
Ronda Rousey gets a "This is

25:19.485 --> 25:21.755
awesome" chant from the WWE

25:21.755 --> 25:22.789
Universe.

25:22.789 --> 25:23.790
This is

25:23.790 --> 25:24.858
awesome!

25:24.858 --> 25:27.160
This is awesome!

25:27.160 --> 25:28.294
Whoa!

25:28.294 --> 25:29.930
Damn.

25:29.930 --> 25:30.997
I definitely didn't

25:30.997 --> 25:34.000
expect her to be this good so

25:34.000 --> 25:35.135
fast.

25:39.806 --> 25:41.141
Oh, my God!

25:41.141 --> 25:42.242
No, you've got to be kidding!

25:42.242 --> 25:43.910
Armbar!

25:43.910 --> 25:45.345
Oh, my God!

25:45.345 --> 25:46.412
Stephanie taps.

25:46.412 --> 25:48.148
Rousey may have broken her arm!

25:51.918 --> 25:54.487
Holy crap.

25:54.487 --> 25:55.656
Oh,.

25:55.656 --> 25:56.657
Here are

25:56.657 --> 25:58.892
your winners by submission:

25:58.892 --> 26:01.602
Kurt Angle and Ronda Rousey!

26:01.602 --> 26:02.603
You guys cannot

26:02.603 --> 26:04.905
say that you expected that out

26:04.905 --> 26:06.640
of Ronda Rousey tonight.

26:06.640 --> 26:08.675
Her future is now.

26:08.675 --> 26:09.710
Congratulations

26:09.710 --> 26:11.945
to Kurt Angle and the WWE

26:11.945 --> 26:16.349
in‐ring debut of Ronda Rousey!

26:16.349 --> 26:17.651
I would hate to follow

26:17.651 --> 26:18.652
that.

26:18.652 --> 26:19.653
Who has to go after

26:19.653 --> 26:20.654
this?

26:22.155 --> 26:23.990
Damn, dude.

26:23.990 --> 26:25.692
Really? Really?

26:25.692 --> 26:27.227
I have to follow that?

26:27.227 --> 26:28.729
Can we have anything else just

26:28.729 --> 26:30.764
drop down on me before I go out

26:30.764 --> 26:33.734
and try to perform in, you know,

26:33.734 --> 26:35.168
in my first‐ever WrestleMania

26:35.168 --> 26:35.902
singles match?

26:35.902 --> 26:37.470
Like....

26:37.470 --> 26:38.338
All right, I got to go now.

26:38.338 --> 26:39.005
Sorry.

26:40.574 --> 26:41.407
You go, girl.

26:41.407 --> 26:42.408
Get it, girl.

26:42.408 --> 26:43.076
An absolutely

26:43.076 --> 26:44.377
incredible night for this young

26:44.377 --> 26:45.746
lady.

26:49.182 --> 26:50.517
The Goddess is on

26:50.517 --> 26:52.886
her pedestal tonight.

26:52.886 --> 26:54.154
She's held her current

26:54.154 --> 26:58.158
championship for 223 days.

26:58.158 --> 27:00.433
Alexa Bliss is cold‐blooded.

27:00.433 --> 27:02.503
She will do absolutely anything

27:02.503 --> 27:03.737
to remain champion.

27:03.737 --> 27:04.805
I'm so excited for

27:04.805 --> 27:05.739
this match.

27:05.739 --> 27:06.740
If you would've told me

27:06.740 --> 27:08.008
a year ago that I would be

27:08.008 --> 27:10.476
facing Alexa at WrestleMania, I

27:10.476 --> 27:12.579
would've been over the moon, but

27:12.579 --> 27:13.947
it's a little different now

27:13.947 --> 27:15.882
because we barely talk.

27:15.882 --> 27:17.383
So, I just tell myself, "Suck it

27:17.383 --> 27:19.886
up. You got this."

27:19.886 --> 27:20.887
I'm gonna go out there and I'm

27:20.887 --> 27:22.188
gonna kill it and everybody is

27:22.188 --> 27:24.257
gonna watch me do it with

27:24.257 --> 27:26.092
style.

27:26.092 --> 27:28.194
An irresistible

27:28.194 --> 27:29.362
force.

27:29.362 --> 27:31.197
Nia Jax, laser focused, walking

27:31.197 --> 27:32.498
with purpose.

27:32.498 --> 27:33.499
And tonight, Nia has the

27:33.499 --> 27:35.702
opportunity to earn the title of

27:35.702 --> 27:37.037
champion.

27:37.037 --> 27:37.904
Thank you.

27:37.904 --> 27:38.705
That's my dinner for

27:38.705 --> 27:39.439
tonight.

27:39.439 --> 27:40.340
The

27:40.340 --> 27:41.508
following contest is for the...

27:41.508 --> 27:42.509
Oh, cheers, I mean,

27:42.509 --> 27:43.544
first.

27:43.544 --> 27:46.146
My baby girl.

27:46.146 --> 27:47.147
Alexa Bliss, Nia

27:47.147 --> 27:48.515
Jax for the Raw Women's

27:48.515 --> 27:51.117
Championship.

27:51.117 --> 27:52.318
This is what Nia's been waiting

27:52.318 --> 27:53.319
for.

27:53.319 --> 27:54.788
She says, "I love who I am.

27:54.788 --> 27:56.256
I'm strong. I'm confident.

27:56.256 --> 27:57.257
I'm different."

27:57.924 --> 27:59.325
Matchup officially underway.

27:59.325 --> 28:00.366
Oh, my God.

28:00.366 --> 28:01.401
Oh, this is not a matchup that

28:01.401 --> 28:03.303
favors Alexa Bliss.

28:03.303 --> 28:05.105
A physical mismatch.

28:05.105 --> 28:06.106
Look at the...

28:06.106 --> 28:07.107
Wow!

28:07.107 --> 28:08.975
The Goddess starting to do work.

28:08.975 --> 28:10.410
Oh! And there it is!

28:10.410 --> 28:11.578
Right to the back of the leg.

28:11.578 --> 28:14.247
Nia's off her feet.

28:14.247 --> 28:15.448
Ooh.

28:15.448 --> 28:16.850
You're the loser!

28:16.850 --> 28:19.653
You're pathetic!

28:19.653 --> 28:23.023
I made you!

28:23.023 --> 28:25.559
You're nothing without me!

28:33.767 --> 28:37.103
Shut the hell up!

28:43.009 --> 28:44.444
Oh! Samoan drop,

28:44.444 --> 28:46.279
crushing the champion!

28:46.279 --> 28:50.250
Nia Jax has done it!

28:52.719 --> 28:54.921
It's like I know

28:54.921 --> 28:56.156
because I know 'cause TJ doesn't

28:56.156 --> 28:57.157
get to be a part of it.

28:57.157 --> 28:57.924
I just get it.

28:57.924 --> 28:58.925
I get it.

28:58.925 --> 28:59.693
I'm fine.

28:59.693 --> 29:00.901
I'm just happy to be here.

29:00.901 --> 29:02.168
Absolutely.

29:02.168 --> 29:03.336
I want Paige to know that I'm

29:03.336 --> 29:04.671
there for her.

29:04.671 --> 29:05.939
I think there is something so

29:05.939 --> 29:07.440
much bigger out there for her

29:07.440 --> 29:08.975
than just competing in the ring.

29:08.975 --> 29:09.976
I'm happy for you.

29:09.976 --> 29:11.778
Thank you.

29:14.748 --> 29:16.082
Nia Jax has done

29:16.082 --> 29:17.083
it!

29:17.083 --> 29:18.218
Hell yes!

29:18.218 --> 29:19.820
The new

29:19.820 --> 29:23.423
Raw Women's Champion, Nia Jax!

29:23.423 --> 29:25.491
Oh, my God!

29:25.491 --> 29:27.127
Now the emotions

29:27.127 --> 29:30.196
come pouring out of Nia Jax on

29:30.196 --> 29:32.432
what has been an emotional ride

29:32.432 --> 29:33.767
to the top of the women's

29:33.767 --> 29:34.768
division.

29:34.768 --> 29:35.769
Take us to Nia.

29:35.769 --> 29:36.970
Take us to the champ.

29:36.970 --> 29:37.704
Everybody in?

29:37.704 --> 29:38.705
What an ovation

29:38.705 --> 29:40.106
here at the Superdome for the

29:40.106 --> 29:42.342
irresistible force.

29:42.342 --> 29:43.343
I never thought I would

29:43.343 --> 29:44.344
become the Raw Women's Champion.

29:44.344 --> 29:45.345
I don't know why.

29:45.345 --> 29:46.613
It's what we work for every day,

29:46.613 --> 29:48.615
but to be able to win the Raw

29:48.615 --> 29:51.752
Women's title at WrestleMania in

29:51.752 --> 29:54.487
a singles match is incredible.

29:54.487 --> 29:56.156
I mean, I'm gonna go down in the

29:56.156 --> 29:58.859
history books and it's amazing.

29:58.859 --> 30:01.201
Nia Jax is now

30:01.201 --> 30:04.671
the Raw Women's Champion.

30:04.671 --> 30:07.140
Nia! Nia!

30:07.140 --> 30:09.209
Nia! Nia!

30:11.545 --> 30:13.379
Oh, my God!

30:13.379 --> 30:14.781
You did amazing.

30:14.781 --> 30:15.982
You did it, baby.

30:15.982 --> 30:16.983
Thank you so much.

30:16.983 --> 30:17.818
Thank you.

30:17.818 --> 30:18.484
You did

30:18.484 --> 30:19.152
amazing.

30:19.152 --> 30:20.153
You killed it,

30:20.153 --> 30:21.522
Nia.

30:21.522 --> 30:22.523
You did it.

30:22.523 --> 30:23.289
And you looked friggin'

30:23.289 --> 30:24.357
beautiful doing it.

30:24.357 --> 30:25.458
This is absolutely massive for

30:25.458 --> 30:26.459
Nia.

30:26.459 --> 30:27.628
She's just become the Raw

30:27.628 --> 30:28.629
Women's Champion.

30:28.629 --> 30:30.063
Like, that is incredible.

30:30.063 --> 30:32.298
Oh, my God.

30:32.298 --> 30:33.299
I got goose bumps just

30:33.299 --> 30:34.635
talking about it.

30:34.635 --> 30:35.636
It's beautiful.

30:35.636 --> 30:37.237
So happy for her.

30:40.807 --> 30:43.476
Just give me a second.

30:53.353 --> 30:54.688
So where are we headed

30:54.688 --> 30:56.590
again?

30:56.590 --> 30:58.324
So, kind of felt like I

30:58.324 --> 30:59.492
needed to clean up Nattie's

30:59.492 --> 31:01.167
mistake a little bit on telling

31:01.167 --> 31:02.636
people whatever she promised

31:02.636 --> 31:03.637
people.

31:03.637 --> 31:04.370
Of course.

31:04.370 --> 31:05.371
They were promised something

31:05.371 --> 31:07.273
that was untrue and it didn't

31:07.273 --> 31:09.009
get produced or delivered.

31:09.009 --> 31:10.176
If you buy Birdiebee

31:10.176 --> 31:11.512
at the WWE Superstore, you're

31:11.512 --> 31:13.780
gonna meet Nikki and Brie Bella.

31:13.780 --> 31:14.981
Birdiebee!

31:14.981 --> 31:16.016
You're gonna meet them if you

31:16.016 --> 31:17.017
buy something at Birdiebee.

31:17.017 --> 31:18.051
Nattie gave us this

31:18.051 --> 31:19.252
flyer on Bourbon Street and said

31:19.252 --> 31:20.887
that we could hang out.

31:20.887 --> 31:22.823
Oh. Nattie did?

31:22.823 --> 31:25.959
There was like ten fans I could

31:25.959 --> 31:27.794
tell were kind of bothered and I

31:27.794 --> 31:28.929
just thought it'd be nice, like,

31:28.929 --> 31:30.030
for them to kind of have like an

31:30.030 --> 31:31.031
intimate, little conversation

31:31.031 --> 31:32.065
with us.

31:32.065 --> 31:33.133
They can ask us some questions.

31:33.133 --> 31:34.067
We can meet them.

31:34.067 --> 31:34.768
Am I dressed

31:34.768 --> 31:36.002
appropriate to have breakfast

31:36.002 --> 31:37.137
with people?

31:37.137 --> 31:38.138
You're dressed very

31:38.138 --> 31:39.139
appropriately and they'll be

31:39.139 --> 31:40.406
very excited.

31:40.406 --> 31:41.842
As president, this all goes on

31:41.842 --> 31:42.843
my shoulders.

31:42.843 --> 31:44.144
So to make this all right and

31:44.144 --> 31:45.546
end the weekend with a bang, I

31:45.546 --> 31:46.747
thought it'd be perfect to have

31:46.747 --> 31:47.981
brunch with the fans that were

31:47.981 --> 31:49.315
promised that they'd get to hang

31:49.315 --> 31:50.817
out with us, smooth everything

31:50.817 --> 31:53.654
over and just do things right.

31:53.654 --> 31:55.789
Here we go.

31:55.789 --> 31:56.890
Hello.

31:56.890 --> 31:57.891
Thank you guys so much for

31:57.891 --> 31:58.759
coming.

31:58.759 --> 31:59.726
Oh, thank you.

31:59.726 --> 32:00.567
Happy to meet you.

32:00.567 --> 32:02.268
First, I want to

32:02.268 --> 32:04.204
apologize for Nattie's

32:04.204 --> 32:05.572
craziness.

32:05.572 --> 32:06.573
Sometimes you can't

32:06.573 --> 32:07.608
help if you're crazy.

32:08.842 --> 32:09.710
And we love Nattie to

32:09.710 --> 32:10.443
death, one of our best friends.

32:10.443 --> 32:11.144
...for‐for what she

32:11.144 --> 32:11.845
promised.

32:11.845 --> 32:12.613
But yeah, I'm happy

32:12.613 --> 32:13.580
that you guys could make this

32:13.580 --> 32:15.015
'cause Nicole and I really do

32:15.015 --> 32:16.950
care about all of you so much.

32:16.950 --> 32:18.151
I was like, "They can't leave

32:18.151 --> 32:20.353
WrestleMania mad."

32:20.353 --> 32:22.222
We love you.

32:22.222 --> 32:23.223
Aw. Well, if you guys

32:23.223 --> 32:24.290
have any questions, obviously,

32:24.290 --> 32:26.426
Nikki and I are open books, so

32:26.426 --> 32:27.794
we will answer any questions,

32:27.794 --> 32:28.795
so...

32:28.795 --> 32:29.663
Do you guys miss the

32:29.663 --> 32:30.664
ring?

32:30.664 --> 32:31.665
Yes. It's actually,

32:31.665 --> 32:33.366
it's really hard sometimes when

32:33.366 --> 32:34.467
you come and you have to sit

32:34.467 --> 32:35.769
back and watch.

32:35.769 --> 32:36.803
How do you girls

32:36.803 --> 32:38.505
manage your time from being a

32:38.505 --> 32:40.941
mom and Birdiebee and Belle

32:40.941 --> 32:42.175
Radici.

32:42.175 --> 32:43.176
Like, when do you sleep?

32:43.176 --> 32:44.077
Yeah. We don't.

32:44.077 --> 32:45.011
We don't.

32:45.679 --> 32:46.813
When you, like, do

32:46.813 --> 32:47.948
things that you're so passionate

32:47.948 --> 32:49.115
about, it doesn't matter.

32:49.115 --> 32:50.717
So, like, Birdiebee is, like,

32:50.717 --> 32:52.418
our passion project, so to see

32:52.418 --> 32:53.854
that come to life, like, we love

32:53.854 --> 32:54.988
being hands‐on with it.

32:54.988 --> 32:56.122
And I brought everyone

32:56.122 --> 32:56.823
a hat.

32:56.823 --> 32:59.359
No way!

32:59.359 --> 33:00.601
You girls are the

33:00.601 --> 33:01.267
best.

33:01.267 --> 33:02.703
Aw, thank you.

33:02.703 --> 33:03.837
And sorry again about

33:03.837 --> 33:05.939
the broken promises, but this

33:05.939 --> 33:06.840
was more fun.

33:06.840 --> 33:08.108
This was way better.

33:08.108 --> 33:09.142
Yeah, way better.

33:09.142 --> 33:10.611
I never really get to just sit

33:10.611 --> 33:12.312
and have lunch with the Bella

33:12.312 --> 33:14.247
Army, and so to actually just

33:14.247 --> 33:16.049
sit with them for an hour or two

33:16.049 --> 33:17.283
and, like, connect with them

33:17.283 --> 33:18.719
face‐to‐face is really cool.

33:18.719 --> 33:20.153
And I really want to do this

33:20.153 --> 33:21.655
more, like, it's neat, it's

33:21.655 --> 33:23.156
intimate, and it totally makes

33:23.156 --> 33:24.825
Brie off the hook.

33:24.825 --> 33:26.126
Brie, that was so amazing.

33:26.126 --> 33:26.893
Thank you.

33:26.893 --> 33:27.928
I could've talked to

33:27.928 --> 33:28.428
them forever.

33:28.428 --> 33:29.129
I know, right?

33:29.129 --> 33:30.163
I feel, like, we need

33:30.163 --> 33:30.897
to have weekly little gatherings

33:30.897 --> 33:31.565
like that.

33:31.565 --> 33:33.433
It's just‐‐ It's humbling and

33:33.433 --> 33:34.735
it's fun and it just puts

33:34.735 --> 33:35.902
everything into perspective.

33:35.902 --> 33:36.570
I know.

33:36.570 --> 33:37.604
I think that was a

33:37.604 --> 33:38.872
very smart move, and I think

33:38.872 --> 33:40.306
that's a good quality to have to

33:40.306 --> 33:41.474
make an amazing president.

33:41.474 --> 33:42.142
Thank you.

33:42.142 --> 33:43.610
It's been a lot of work, and

33:43.610 --> 33:44.845
it's been very tough, but I

33:44.845 --> 33:47.113
realize that it's a big job, and

33:47.113 --> 33:50.216
that we just keep, you know,

33:50.216 --> 33:51.351
having someone else in that

33:51.351 --> 33:52.285
position, but as long as...

33:52.285 --> 33:52.986
You mean keeping

33:52.986 --> 33:54.120
someone who has, like, a

33:54.120 --> 33:56.056
professional résumé of knowing

33:56.056 --> 33:58.091
what it's like to run a company?

33:58.091 --> 33:58.892
Yes.

33:58.892 --> 34:00.534
Honestly, I can't just do this

34:00.534 --> 34:01.835
job by myself, like, I need

34:01.835 --> 34:02.503
Nikki.

34:02.503 --> 34:04.938
So, co‐presidents, co‐founders,

34:04.938 --> 34:06.206
everything we do is everything

34:06.206 --> 34:07.808
together, and that's the perfect

34:07.808 --> 34:08.474
way to go.

34:08.474 --> 34:09.710
We'll always be

34:09.710 --> 34:10.476
hands‐on, we just don't have

34:10.476 --> 34:11.143
to have the title of being a

34:11.143 --> 34:11.812
president.

34:11.812 --> 34:12.513
Maybe not the title,

34:12.513 --> 34:13.346
I'll just wear the hat.

34:13.346 --> 34:14.047
One day, maybe.

34:14.047 --> 34:15.281
We'll just wear the hat of it.

34:15.281 --> 34:16.315
I'll get you a president hat.

34:16.315 --> 34:17.050
How about that?

34:17.050 --> 34:18.418
I would love that, or

34:18.418 --> 34:19.753
maybe a cute little pin.

34:19.753 --> 34:21.187
Yeah, or a crown.

34:24.525 --> 34:25.458
Wait, guys, don't

34:25.458 --> 34:26.592
forget about me back here.

34:26.592 --> 34:27.728
All right, excuse me,

34:27.728 --> 34:28.862
ladies, this is my street.

34:28.862 --> 34:29.795
Excuse me,

34:29.795 --> 34:30.295
we're here.

34:30.295 --> 34:31.164
Oh, there it is.

34:31.164 --> 34:32.032
There it is, there's the

34:32.032 --> 34:33.065
lingerie store I wanted to go

34:33.065 --> 34:33.567
to.

34:33.567 --> 34:34.868
It's called Trashy Diva, which

34:34.868 --> 34:37.670
is perfect for us. Hello.

34:37.670 --> 34:38.905
Because I'm not gonna be

34:38.905 --> 34:40.306
wrestling due to injury, I want

34:40.306 --> 34:41.975
to do more stuff.

34:41.975 --> 34:43.944
Like, we travel all the time,

34:43.944 --> 34:45.378
but we don't get to really hang

34:45.378 --> 34:46.813
out, and we don't get to really

34:46.813 --> 34:48.148
sightsee and do all the fun

34:48.148 --> 34:49.783
stuff that the different states

34:49.783 --> 34:50.551
have to offer.

34:50.551 --> 34:52.217
Ooh, this is frikkin' hot.

34:52.217 --> 34:53.820
Are you kidding? Okay.

34:53.820 --> 34:55.355
And, honestly, it just takes my

34:55.355 --> 34:56.822
mind off everything, and it's

34:56.822 --> 34:57.558
nice.

34:57.558 --> 34:58.825
I'm sexy, but I'm kind of a

34:58.825 --> 34:59.492
bitch.

34:59.492 --> 35:00.466
No, you're really

35:00.466 --> 35:01.134
choking me.

35:01.134 --> 35:02.769
It's appropriate.

35:02.769 --> 35:04.070
Great stuff.

35:04.070 --> 35:04.905
Great stuff.

35:04.905 --> 35:06.406
It's amazing.

35:06.406 --> 35:07.207
Oh, my God.

35:07.207 --> 35:07.908
What'd it say?

35:07.908 --> 35:08.942
Lana just text me, but

35:08.942 --> 35:10.043
I'm gonna leave it on "read"

35:10.043 --> 35:10.711
again.

35:12.646 --> 35:13.146
Swear.

35:13.146 --> 35:14.014
Okay, wait, what does

35:14.014 --> 35:14.515
it say?

35:14.515 --> 35:15.381
Oh, my God, she's

35:15.381 --> 35:16.617
like, "Hey, it's Lana, I can't

35:16.617 --> 35:18.084
wait to hang out with you."

35:18.084 --> 35:19.753
Oh. It's her again.

35:19.753 --> 35:21.354
Someone's got a little, uh...

35:21.354 --> 35:22.823
Come on, we're really

35:22.823 --> 35:24.124
busy right now, can you leave us

35:24.124 --> 35:24.791
alone?

35:24.791 --> 35:25.826
She goes, "I love you.

35:25.826 --> 35:26.760
Do you love me?"

35:28.662 --> 35:29.563
Why is your phone

35:29.563 --> 35:30.296
blowing up right now?

35:30.296 --> 35:31.164
She's, like, in love

35:31.164 --> 35:32.132
with me or something.

35:32.132 --> 35:33.266
Lana, chill out.

35:33.266 --> 35:34.034
She's like, "Hello,

35:34.034 --> 35:34.868
question mark.

35:34.868 --> 35:35.769
What are you doing?"

35:35.769 --> 35:36.670
What is wrong with her?

35:36.670 --> 35:37.704
Are you gonna leave it

35:37.704 --> 35:38.204
on "read"?

35:38.204 --> 35:39.405
Oh, absolutely.

35:42.342 --> 35:43.243
Let's fly.

35:43.243 --> 35:44.511
Let's go get drinks.

35:46.513 --> 35:47.914
It is hot as hell out

35:47.914 --> 35:48.682
here, guys.

35:48.682 --> 35:50.350
Mama's beauty hole is sweatin'.

35:50.350 --> 35:52.385
Wow.

35:54.888 --> 35:56.122
No, no, no, it's a

35:56.122 --> 35:58.859
child, that's a child.

36:02.936 --> 36:03.937
Yeah!

36:03.937 --> 36:05.271
I love you guys.

36:05.271 --> 36:07.307
Cheers.

36:07.307 --> 36:08.942
Show us your tits!

36:13.079 --> 36:14.314
Y'all get out first, so

36:14.314 --> 36:15.816
I can make that grand entrance.

36:15.816 --> 36:17.050
Got to let, got to

36:17.050 --> 36:19.920
let extra‐ness out right here.

36:19.920 --> 36:22.889
Oh, my God.

36:22.889 --> 36:24.758
Guys, I'm gonna get

36:24.758 --> 36:25.892
shots for everyone 'cause I'm

36:25.892 --> 36:27.027
really happy that everyone came

36:27.027 --> 36:28.194
tonight, it's really cool.

36:28.194 --> 36:29.029
I've been living vicariously

36:29.029 --> 36:30.063
through you guys right now.

36:30.063 --> 36:31.164
Thank you, baby.

36:31.164 --> 36:32.398
Well, we love you so much.

36:32.398 --> 36:33.634
Yes, thank you, guys.

36:33.634 --> 36:34.367
Have fun.

36:34.367 --> 36:35.035
Thank you.

36:35.035 --> 36:35.769
All right, cheers,

36:35.769 --> 36:36.436
guys.

36:36.436 --> 36:37.971
Cheers.

36:37.971 --> 36:42.242
Yeah!

36:42.242 --> 36:44.044
Tomorrow, we have to

36:44.044 --> 36:45.646
see Paige retire.

36:45.646 --> 36:49.049
It's just bizarre how life works

36:49.049 --> 36:52.686
in such... mysterious w...

36:52.686 --> 36:54.354
in such weird ways.

36:54.354 --> 36:55.622
It just, it just blows

36:55.622 --> 36:58.058
my mind every day still that,

36:58.058 --> 37:00.199
like, six years I've been here.

37:00.199 --> 37:00.867
Yeah.

37:00.867 --> 37:02.201
I'm just, like...

37:02.201 --> 37:02.969
It's mind‐blowing.

37:02.969 --> 37:03.970
Yeah, blows my mind.

37:03.970 --> 37:04.804
What I love is that

37:04.804 --> 37:05.772
you're so true to yourself,

37:05.772 --> 37:06.906
like, it's such an inspiration.

37:06.906 --> 37:07.741
She's always been the

37:07.741 --> 37:08.407
same person.

37:08.407 --> 37:09.375
Yeah, and that's‐‐

37:09.375 --> 37:10.510
I know, I love it.

37:10.510 --> 37:11.745
That's what I love about her.

37:11.745 --> 37:12.579
She doesn't change.

37:12.579 --> 37:13.813
I want Paige to know

37:13.813 --> 37:15.248
that I'm there for her, and I

37:15.248 --> 37:16.550
will always be there for her.

37:16.550 --> 37:18.151
I have a very strong affection

37:18.151 --> 37:20.386
and love for her, but I also

37:20.386 --> 37:22.222
want Paige to take care of her

37:22.222 --> 37:23.023
body.

37:23.023 --> 37:24.124
It's, like, I know because I

37:24.124 --> 37:25.158
know, 'cause TJ doesn't get to

37:25.158 --> 37:26.026
be a part of it.

37:26.026 --> 37:27.661
I just get it. I get it.

37:27.661 --> 37:28.862
It's‐‐ and you know, it's okay

37:28.862 --> 37:30.096
to be, it's okay to reflect on

37:30.096 --> 37:30.964
it, but you're also really

37:30.964 --> 37:31.464
strong.

37:31.464 --> 37:32.332
You're doing lots of great

37:32.332 --> 37:32.833
things.

37:32.833 --> 37:34.300
I promise I'm fine.

37:34.300 --> 37:35.301
I just really want

37:35.301 --> 37:36.703
Paige to consider what's next.

37:36.703 --> 37:37.938
I think there is something so

37:37.938 --> 37:39.540
much bigger out there for her

37:39.540 --> 37:41.642
than just competing in the ring.

37:41.642 --> 37:42.743
I'm happy for you.

37:42.743 --> 37:45.378
Thank you.

37:45.378 --> 37:46.379
Representing

37:46.379 --> 37:49.315
Absolution, Paige!

37:49.315 --> 37:50.450
I'm nervous for her.

37:50.450 --> 37:51.685
Today's the day Paige has to

37:51.685 --> 37:52.519
announce her retirement.

37:52.519 --> 37:53.654
I'll tell you,

37:53.654 --> 37:55.021
she accomplished so much.

37:55.021 --> 37:57.524
She's just... she's the

37:57.524 --> 37:59.259
best.

38:09.309 --> 38:10.511
Welcome to the <i>Raw</i>

38:10.511 --> 38:12.679
after WrestleMania, live in New

38:12.679 --> 38:14.881
Orleans.

38:16.850 --> 38:17.618
We definitely

38:17.618 --> 38:19.052
want a little bit of a smile

38:19.052 --> 38:20.587
coming across. Good. Perfect.

38:20.587 --> 38:21.254
Damn!

38:21.254 --> 38:22.088
All right, I'm good.

38:22.088 --> 38:22.823
We're done.

38:22.823 --> 38:24.825
We're done.

38:30.496 --> 38:33.667
Today, I have to, um,

38:33.667 --> 38:35.736
tell the entire world that I'm

38:35.736 --> 38:38.705
no longer gonna be, um, in

38:38.705 --> 38:41.575
in‐ring competition anymore.

38:41.575 --> 38:43.610
Hello.

38:43.610 --> 38:44.444
You're so beautiful.

38:44.444 --> 38:45.579
I'm so proud of her.

38:45.579 --> 38:47.247
Look at her. The champ.

38:47.247 --> 38:48.248
Congratulations.

38:48.248 --> 38:49.382
I'm proud of you.

38:49.382 --> 38:50.050
How's it going?

38:50.050 --> 38:50.784
It's going good.

38:50.784 --> 38:51.552
We're actually just going

38:51.552 --> 38:52.519
through some of the primary

38:52.519 --> 38:53.186
stuff tonight.

38:53.186 --> 38:53.920
You need anything?

38:53.920 --> 38:54.821
I added and subtracted

38:54.821 --> 38:56.022
some stuff.

38:56.022 --> 38:56.923
After this, I'm probably just

38:56.923 --> 38:58.158
gonna go on a silence thing and

38:58.158 --> 38:59.225
just, like, try not to speak to

38:59.225 --> 38:59.960
people.

38:59.960 --> 39:01.134
Okay. No, no, yeah.

39:01.134 --> 39:02.068
I'll catch up with you

39:02.068 --> 39:02.736
in‐in a second.

39:02.736 --> 39:03.770
Well, then text me if

39:03.770 --> 39:04.437
you need anything.

39:04.437 --> 39:05.405
I love you, Champ.

39:05.405 --> 39:08.775
Love you.

39:08.775 --> 39:10.143
I don't want to think

39:10.143 --> 39:12.913
about it, but it has to happen.

39:12.913 --> 39:15.248
Bryan did it. I can do it, too.

39:15.248 --> 39:16.282
Making her

39:16.282 --> 39:17.718
way to the ring, accompanied by

39:17.718 --> 39:20.120
Sonya Deville and Mandy Rose,

39:20.120 --> 39:24.290
representing Absolution, Paige!

39:24.290 --> 39:25.559
I'm nervous for her.

39:25.559 --> 39:26.527
Which one?

39:26.527 --> 39:27.293
Uh, Paige.

39:27.293 --> 39:28.228
I'm, like, like...

39:28.228 --> 39:29.462
Paige, a true

39:29.462 --> 39:31.331
trailblazer of the women's

39:31.331 --> 39:32.599
evolution.

39:32.599 --> 39:33.834
I think she'll be fine

39:33.834 --> 39:35.035
if she pushes through.

39:35.035 --> 39:36.202
Oh, man.

39:36.202 --> 39:37.337
Today's the day Paige

39:37.337 --> 39:40.106
has to announce her retirement.

39:40.106 --> 39:41.542
Oh, God, I get emotional talking

39:41.542 --> 39:42.375
about Paige.

39:42.375 --> 39:45.078
She's just... she's the best.

39:46.112 --> 39:47.247
This is always

39:47.247 --> 39:48.448
the greatest night of the year,

39:48.448 --> 39:49.482
as far as Raw is concerned.

39:49.482 --> 39:50.350
But, my goodness, how many

39:50.350 --> 39:52.152
more surprises are we in store

39:52.152 --> 39:53.854
for in the next couple of hours?

39:53.854 --> 39:55.956
Some of you may know

39:55.956 --> 39:58.391
this, some of you don't, though.

39:58.391 --> 40:00.033
So I had to come clean to you

40:00.033 --> 40:01.602
guys.

40:01.602 --> 40:03.236
It was really hard for me to sit

40:03.236 --> 40:04.738
at the sidelines yesterday at

40:04.738 --> 40:08.575
WrestleMania.

40:08.575 --> 40:09.810
I love this ring.

40:09.810 --> 40:11.578
I was born to be in this ring.

40:11.578 --> 40:13.547
This is my heart, this is my

40:13.547 --> 40:15.849
soul and this is my blood.

40:22.488 --> 40:24.390
It really hurts telling them

40:24.390 --> 40:27.027
good‐bye, and...

40:27.027 --> 40:28.762
I mean, I love,

40:28.762 --> 40:30.096
I love these people.

40:30.096 --> 40:32.098
I love it. I love their energy.

40:35.101 --> 40:36.436
I'm closing my eyes and just

40:36.436 --> 40:37.671
taking it in and just being

40:37.671 --> 40:39.540
thankful for what I had and what

40:39.540 --> 40:41.575
I accomplished.

40:41.575 --> 40:42.576
The

40:42.576 --> 40:44.845
following is a Divas Tag Team

40:44.845 --> 40:46.046
Contest, set for one fall.

40:46.046 --> 40:47.548
Over 70,000 on

40:47.548 --> 40:48.849
hand for this Divas Tag Team

40:48.849 --> 40:49.616
match.

40:49.616 --> 40:51.451
This is my house!

40:51.451 --> 40:52.452
Here are

40:52.452 --> 40:53.253
your winners.

40:53.253 --> 40:54.120
Paige celebrating

40:54.120 --> 40:55.355
their victory here

40:55.355 --> 40:56.890
at WrestleMania.

40:59.459 --> 41:01.001
It's crazy going from

41:01.001 --> 41:02.669
13‐year‐old me to travelling the

41:02.669 --> 41:04.104
world 'cause I wanted to be a

41:04.104 --> 41:05.772
WWE Superstar.

41:05.772 --> 41:07.207
Like, when you hear that name,

41:07.207 --> 41:09.510
you think about WWE.

41:09.510 --> 41:10.744
This is one of the hardest

41:10.744 --> 41:12.178
things I'll ever have to say in

41:12.178 --> 41:14.881
my entire career.

41:14.881 --> 41:15.682
Thank

41:15.682 --> 41:16.382
you, Paige.

41:16.382 --> 41:17.651
Thank you, Paige.

41:17.651 --> 41:19.085
Thank you, Paige!

41:19.085 --> 41:20.320
Thank you, Paige.

41:20.320 --> 41:21.454
Thank you, Paige!

41:21.454 --> 41:22.923
Thank you, Paige.

41:22.923 --> 41:24.424
Unfortunately, due to

41:24.424 --> 41:26.192
neck injuries, I can no longer

41:26.192 --> 41:28.061
perform as an in‐ring

41:28.061 --> 41:29.863
competitor.

41:35.235 --> 41:37.237
I would like to thank WWE for

41:37.237 --> 41:39.239
letting me do this and entertain

41:39.239 --> 41:41.241
every single one of you for the

41:41.241 --> 41:44.077
past four years.

41:44.077 --> 41:45.779
New Orleans, four years ago, is

41:45.779 --> 41:47.080
where I debuted and won the

41:47.080 --> 41:50.183
Divas Championship.

41:50.183 --> 41:51.752
And four years later, New

41:51.752 --> 41:53.386
Orleans is where I want to

41:53.386 --> 41:55.388
retire.

41:55.388 --> 41:56.857
This is

41:56.857 --> 41:59.993
your house!

41:59.993 --> 42:02.603
This is your house!

42:02.603 --> 42:05.572
This is your house.

42:05.572 --> 42:06.973
This is your house!

42:06.973 --> 42:08.308
The fans are my world

42:08.308 --> 42:10.744
because, at my lowest, they were

42:10.744 --> 42:12.613
just always so supportive and

42:12.613 --> 42:13.914
they helped me kick out of

42:13.914 --> 42:15.048
whatever I was going through.

42:15.048 --> 42:16.282
They helped me get off rock

42:16.282 --> 42:17.718
bottom, which is why I love them

42:17.718 --> 42:18.819
so much.

42:18.819 --> 42:20.954
Thank you.

42:20.954 --> 42:23.023
Thank you, thank you.

42:23.023 --> 42:24.390
Thank you all so much.

42:24.390 --> 42:26.359
I love you all, and, yes, this

42:26.359 --> 42:30.831
will always be my house.

42:30.831 --> 42:35.201
♪ Where does the love

42:35.201 --> 42:38.038
go? ♪

42:38.038 --> 42:39.405
A short career

42:39.405 --> 42:40.874
for Paige, guys, but I'll tell

42:40.874 --> 42:42.843
you, she accomplished so much.

42:42.843 --> 42:44.210
She is such a bright light

42:44.210 --> 42:45.646
backstage, and I know how

42:45.646 --> 42:47.213
difficult that was for her to

42:47.213 --> 42:49.950
do.

42:49.950 --> 42:51.585
It's beautiful.

42:51.585 --> 42:53.153
It's‐it's a horrible end 'cause

42:53.153 --> 42:55.522
it's so‐‐ it's too soon, but

42:55.522 --> 42:57.658
it's beautiful to see the crazy

42:57.658 --> 43:01.334
amount of support that I have.

43:01.334 --> 43:02.969
I'm really happy I got to be a

43:02.969 --> 43:03.737
part of it.

43:03.737 --> 43:05.171
Now I have to try and think

43:05.171 --> 43:07.307
about my future.

43:10.310 --> 43:11.578
Next week on <i>Total</i>

43:11.578 --> 43:12.245
Divas...

43:12.245 --> 43:13.814
Cake? More cake?

43:13.814 --> 43:14.981
This, gone.

43:14.981 --> 43:16.216
I know I have to

43:16.216 --> 43:17.918
take care of my body, but I got

43:17.918 --> 43:19.553
to live my best life.

43:20.587 --> 43:22.022
Grab my butt.

43:22.022 --> 43:23.724
I've taken it into my own hands

43:23.724 --> 43:24.891
to create some buzz.

43:27.994 --> 43:29.029
It's so awesome to

43:29.029 --> 43:30.363
have a story line with Ronda.

43:30.363 --> 43:31.798
It's so cool.

43:31.798 --> 43:32.933
We're finally getting the chance

43:32.933 --> 43:34.067
to work together.
