00:06.673 --> 00:10.176
[slick music]

00:10.218 --> 00:12.345
[camera shutter clicking]
- Oh, hell yeah.

00:12.387 --> 00:14.472
That's badass.
You're a fucking warrior.

00:14.514 --> 00:17.225
You're Tarzan.
You tame the jungle.

00:17.267 --> 00:18.601
Now do one
where you're smiling.

00:18.643 --> 00:20.103
- Okay.

00:20.145 --> 00:21.730
- Bigger smile.

00:21.771 --> 00:23.356
Bigger. Come on.

00:23.398 --> 00:24.607
Think about
all the snakes you killed.

00:24.649 --> 00:27.402
- No, I didn't like
killing snakes.

00:27.444 --> 00:29.070
- The magazine sent over
a bio that said--

00:29.112 --> 00:30.905
- I was broke
and I entered a contest.

00:30.947 --> 00:33.033
I used the winnings
to start building my empire,

00:33.074 --> 00:34.367
but it was horrifying.

00:34.409 --> 00:36.202
- Okay, then think
about your empire.

00:36.244 --> 00:37.412
Think about how rich you are.

00:37.454 --> 00:39.330
Think about how much
more money you have

00:39.372 --> 00:42.208
than every other person
in this room combined.

00:42.250 --> 00:45.211
- Come on, man.
That doesn't make me smile.

00:45.253 --> 00:46.629
I mean, there's only
five people here.

00:46.671 --> 00:48.214
- Hold on, I just gotta
swap lenses.

00:48.256 --> 00:50.425
Give me the 50.
- Grab the 50!

00:50.467 --> 00:53.219
- You know, I've shot
a ton of CEOs, 12 covers.

00:53.261 --> 00:54.679
This snake thing has got to be

00:54.721 --> 00:56.556
the craziest origin story
I've ever heard.

00:56.598 --> 00:57.932
- Honestly,
that shit was boring

00:57.974 --> 00:58.975
compared to what came next.

00:59.017 --> 01:00.310
- Oh, fuck. What came next?

01:00.352 --> 01:01.936
- Three words:

01:01.978 --> 01:04.689
saw palmetto berries.

01:04.731 --> 01:10.487
* *

01:10.528 --> 01:11.321
- Oh.

01:11.363 --> 01:13.239
- They're worth a fortune

01:13.281 --> 01:15.283
and they only grow
in coastal Florida.

01:17.118 --> 01:18.536
- I mean, okay. Cool.

01:18.578 --> 01:20.246
- Cool?

01:20.288 --> 01:22.415
It was a modern-day gold rush.
- Yeah, sure.

01:22.457 --> 01:24.125
It just sounds way less
exciting than snake hunting.

01:24.167 --> 01:25.752
- That's because you haven't
heard the story, motherfucker.

01:25.794 --> 01:26.920
Listen up.

01:26.961 --> 01:30.006
[equipment beeping]
[indistinct chatter]

01:30.048 --> 01:32.133
One, two, three.

01:32.175 --> 01:34.302
Welcome to Henry's Farm.

01:34.344 --> 01:36.221
As you can see,
we're just getting settled.

01:36.262 --> 01:38.264
It's taken a long time
to get to this point,

01:38.306 --> 01:39.432
but we're on track.

01:39.474 --> 01:41.935
- This lush
and fecund swampland

01:41.976 --> 01:45.105
is ready to burst forth
with fertile abundance.

01:45.146 --> 01:46.314
- Did we agree
on that language?

01:46.356 --> 01:47.816
- We'll postgame later.
Stay focused.

01:47.857 --> 01:49.150
- As my partner was saying,

01:49.192 --> 01:51.778
a purchase commitment
from Green Bounty Organics

01:51.820 --> 01:53.738
would allow us to secure
additional funding to grow--

01:53.780 --> 01:55.532
- Okay, okay, okay, okay.
We're in.

01:55.573 --> 01:56.991
- What?
- You are?

01:57.033 --> 01:58.702
- Saw palmetto extract is huge.

01:58.743 --> 02:01.121
The whole men's health market
is exploding,

02:01.162 --> 02:02.414
so we're prepared

02:02.455 --> 02:03.915
to prepurchase
your entire crop.

02:03.957 --> 02:05.417
What do you say?

02:05.458 --> 02:09.671
- I'm sorry, I'm just so used
to being rejected.

02:09.713 --> 02:12.048
I was prepared to follow you
to your car pleading.

02:12.090 --> 02:13.174
- And I was supposed
to tell you

02:13.216 --> 02:14.384
how both of our dad's died.

02:14.426 --> 02:15.760
Gunshot, heart attack.

02:15.802 --> 02:16.886
- Why would that
have been relevant?

02:16.928 --> 02:18.638
- Endearing context
for our struggles.

02:18.680 --> 02:21.057
- It doesn't matter.
Yes, we will take the deal.

02:21.099 --> 02:23.143
- Here we go.
[chuckles]

02:23.184 --> 02:24.519
- Ooh!

02:24.561 --> 02:26.479
- Do you want to sign
on the hood of my car?

02:26.521 --> 02:28.523
- Or, if you don't mind
waiting,

02:28.565 --> 02:30.316
we can do it in our new office,

02:30.358 --> 02:32.402
kick this partnership off
in style.

02:32.444 --> 02:36.322
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
[indistinct shouting]

02:36.364 --> 02:37.949
- Fuck, fuck, fuck. Fuck.

02:40.035 --> 02:41.578
No!

02:45.498 --> 02:49.169
[indistinct shouting]

02:49.210 --> 02:50.420
You know, I can actually
sign out here.

02:50.462 --> 02:51.796
It's nice to do business
in the sun.

02:51.838 --> 02:53.757
Jillian, back desk, now!

02:53.798 --> 02:56.801
Initial here. Sign here.

02:56.843 --> 02:59.137
We're in business.
No backsies.

02:59.179 --> 03:03.933

03:13.401 --> 03:14.569

03:14.611 --> 03:16.821
- Yo, it's Zay.
Leave a message.

03:16.863 --> 03:18.490
[line beeps]

03:18.531 --> 03:20.950
- It's me, calling again
for the hundredth time.

03:20.992 --> 03:23.870
Hope you're having fun out west
or wherever.

03:25.997 --> 03:27.582
Nessa's coming.
I get to show off to her,

03:27.624 --> 03:29.542
so it's a big day here.

03:29.584 --> 03:31.628
Thought I'd give you a shot,
see if you answer.

03:31.670 --> 03:33.421
Anyway, give me a call.

03:33.463 --> 03:36.758
This is your brother, Craig,
from growing up together.

03:36.800 --> 03:43.765

03:54.109 --> 03:57.028
[chuckles]
Gabriel.

03:57.070 --> 03:58.738
There he is. How's it going?

03:58.780 --> 04:00.699
- I almost filled up another
crate of the berries, sir.

04:00.740 --> 04:02.325
- [laughs]
I love that!

04:02.367 --> 04:06.287
[whistling]

04:08.790 --> 04:10.250
Angel, my man.

04:10.291 --> 04:11.626
How much money
did you make me today?

04:11.668 --> 04:13.253
- Uh...
- I'm kidding with you.

04:13.294 --> 04:14.754
I'm just in such a good mood.

04:14.796 --> 04:16.673
My daughter's visiting
from California today.

04:16.715 --> 04:18.133
She's never seen the farm.

04:18.174 --> 04:19.426
I'm so excited to show her

04:19.467 --> 04:22.387
something I built
with my own two hands.

04:22.429 --> 04:24.931
Our own four hands.

04:24.973 --> 04:27.809
Everyone lends a hand.
It doesn't matter.

04:27.851 --> 04:31.479
[whistling]

04:31.521 --> 04:37.986
* *

04:38.028 --> 04:40.321
- [sighs]

04:40.363 --> 04:42.615
- J Glopp, what up, partner?

04:42.657 --> 04:45.535
- I feel so bad parking the Kia
next to the billboard.

04:45.577 --> 04:47.787
It's like bringing a hot
new boyfriend around an ex.

04:47.829 --> 04:49.247
- I know you love this car,
Jillian,

04:49.289 --> 04:50.874
but it's really not
that special.

04:50.915 --> 04:53.043
- So now
Bluetooth connectivity

04:53.084 --> 04:54.419
is "not that special."

04:54.461 --> 04:56.963
I'm sorry, can you transmit
sound through the air?

04:57.005 --> 04:58.798
- That's kind of what
talking is.

04:58.840 --> 05:00.508
- Your Toyota Tundra's
a fucking joke.

05:00.550 --> 05:01.801
- What was that?
- Nothing.

05:01.843 --> 05:03.553
Is Nessa here yet?
Are you excited?

05:03.595 --> 05:06.014
You must be so excited.
- I can't wait.

05:06.056 --> 05:08.683
It's been ten months.
She's 13 now.

05:08.725 --> 05:10.518
She's never seen me succeed
at anything before.

05:10.560 --> 05:11.978
- If you want your daughter
to like the place,

05:12.020 --> 05:13.313
you might want to have
the guy come

05:13.355 --> 05:14.522
and empty the port-a-potty.

05:14.564 --> 05:15.982
- Shayla, it was just emptied
last week.

05:16.024 --> 05:17.609
- It needs to be emptied
every week, boss.

05:17.650 --> 05:19.361
- There are only five of us
on this farm.

05:19.402 --> 05:20.570
It shouldn't fill up that fast.

05:20.612 --> 05:22.655
- Oh, I know it shouldn't,
and yet...

05:22.697 --> 05:24.949
- Look, I don't want to get
in another fight about this

05:24.991 --> 05:26.951
because my daughter's coming
and I don't want to be

05:26.993 --> 05:29.662
embarrassed in front of her,
but I go above and beyond

05:29.704 --> 05:31.706
what's legally required of me
in terms of sanitation.

05:31.748 --> 05:33.708
- I'm not as versed
in shit law as you,

05:33.750 --> 05:35.418
but I do know this:
it bakes in the sun,

05:35.460 --> 05:36.836
and if I'm in there
for more than 20 minutes,

05:36.878 --> 05:38.254
I feel like
I'm about to pass out.

05:38.296 --> 05:40.131
- Why are you ever in there
more than 20 minutes?

05:40.173 --> 05:41.675
- Whoa, asking a woman?

05:41.716 --> 05:45.095
That's technically harassment,
Craig, and you're on tape.

05:45.136 --> 05:46.638
- Shayla, it's too expensive

05:46.680 --> 05:47.847
to have the truck come
every week.

05:47.889 --> 05:49.849
End of discussion.
- Jillian?

05:49.891 --> 05:51.976
- We'll figure out a way
to make it work.

05:55.105 --> 05:56.398
- No, we won't!

05:58.316 --> 05:59.693
You can't let that absolute

05:59.734 --> 06:01.486
soft serve machine
order you around.

06:01.528 --> 06:03.279
- She's not ordering me around.
She's my friend.

06:03.321 --> 06:04.739
- Jillian, you're a boss.

06:04.781 --> 06:06.783
These are your employees,
not your friends.

06:06.825 --> 06:08.827
- You can be someone's boss
and their friend.

06:08.868 --> 06:11.454
Chewbacca is great friends
with Han Solo.

06:11.496 --> 06:12.831
- You do you.

06:12.872 --> 06:14.541
I'm not gonna worry about it

06:14.582 --> 06:18.628
because Nessa's almost here
and I am happy.

06:19.587 --> 06:21.715
- Hey, Craig Foster.

06:21.756 --> 06:23.383
- Yeah. I'm sorry, who are you?

06:23.425 --> 06:25.176
- Natalie-Ray Boone.

06:25.218 --> 06:27.595
My family works down the road.
You ever heard of Carpets?

06:27.637 --> 06:29.431
- Yeah, the old strip club.
- Yeah, that's our place.

06:29.472 --> 06:30.932
We got closed down when this

06:30.974 --> 06:32.517
"Good Will Hunting"-ass
stripper

06:32.559 --> 06:34.060
started to poke around
in our taxes.

06:34.102 --> 06:36.187
- Hmm.

06:36.229 --> 06:37.689
- You want to come with me?

06:37.731 --> 06:39.607
I want to talk to you
about a business proposition.

06:39.649 --> 06:41.901
- Wow. That's flattering.

06:41.943 --> 06:44.487
And as much as everything about
your vibe seems normal,

06:44.529 --> 06:45.655
I'm actually really busy
right now.

06:45.697 --> 06:46.948
- I wasn't asking.

06:46.990 --> 06:49.576
[tense music]

06:49.617 --> 06:52.203
* *

06:52.245 --> 06:53.288
Welcome to Carpets,

06:53.329 --> 06:55.331
where the only carpet
is on the floor.

06:55.373 --> 06:56.458
- [muffled screaming]

06:56.499 --> 06:58.585
- Fucking seriously,
Ray-Nathan?

06:58.626 --> 06:59.919
- Oh, shit.

06:59.961 --> 07:01.379
- What the fuck, Nattie?
Who's this?

07:01.421 --> 07:03.256
- Oh, this is our neighbor
Mom told me to go get.

07:03.298 --> 07:04.591
- Well, nobody fucking told me.

07:04.632 --> 07:06.760
- Oh, I told you.
You just don't listen to me.

07:06.801 --> 07:07.969
You're always looking
at your phone.

07:08.011 --> 07:09.721
- The group chat doesn't care
if I'm busy.

07:09.763 --> 07:11.222
When it pops off, it pops off.

07:11.264 --> 07:13.475
- Hey, if you're busy,
I can come back another time.

07:13.516 --> 07:15.101
You can call me.
- Nah, fuck it.

07:15.143 --> 07:18.688
Probably good for him to see
who he's dealing with.

07:18.730 --> 07:21.191
See this gentleman here?

07:21.232 --> 07:23.985
He was supposed to deliver
some merchandise for us.

07:24.027 --> 07:25.320
- Drugs.

07:25.362 --> 07:28.073
- And that merchandise
mysteriously went missing.

07:28.114 --> 07:29.115
- He did the drugs.

07:29.157 --> 07:30.450
- God damn it, Nattie.

07:30.492 --> 07:32.285
I'm trying to be
evocative here.

07:32.327 --> 07:34.662
You got no mystique.
That's why you're still single.

07:34.704 --> 07:37.332
- I'm single
'cause I work all the time.

07:37.374 --> 07:40.585
- Now, this

07:40.627 --> 07:42.879
is what happens

07:42.921 --> 07:47.300
when somebody messes
with our merchandise.

07:47.342 --> 07:49.302
[grunts]
[alligator hissing]

07:49.344 --> 07:51.304
- [screaming]
- Hell no.

07:51.346 --> 07:53.139
- Nobody fucks with the Boones!

08:00.772 --> 08:02.482
[muffled]
Please help me!

08:02.524 --> 08:05.610
[breathing heavily]

08:09.531 --> 08:12.826
- Come on. Sic him.
[whistles]

08:12.867 --> 08:14.994
What the hell?
Why isn't he hungry, huh?

08:15.036 --> 08:16.496
Did you feed the fucking gator?

08:16.538 --> 08:18.248
- Well, the thing
about Buttercup--

08:18.289 --> 08:20.792
- Don't fucking name him,
and definitely not Buttercup!

08:20.834 --> 08:22.627
- Okay, first of all,
it is a girl

08:22.669 --> 08:23.962
because she is pretty.

08:24.004 --> 08:26.256
And yes, I gave her a treat.

08:26.297 --> 08:27.674
If we want her to be sweet,

08:27.716 --> 08:29.134
we have to give her a treat
to be sweet!

08:29.175 --> 08:31.011
- We don't want her
to be sweet.

08:31.052 --> 08:32.887
She's an alligator.
She's supposed to be scary.

08:32.929 --> 08:34.681
- You know what's fucking scary

08:34.723 --> 08:36.683
is when a cutie doesn't
get her treat.

08:36.725 --> 08:39.644
- Leave it!
Hey, leave it.

08:39.686 --> 08:41.896
Leave it.
[snaps]

08:44.399 --> 08:48.194
* *

08:48.236 --> 08:49.863
I'm Jackie Boone,

08:49.904 --> 08:52.574
and these are
my dumb-fuck children.

08:52.615 --> 08:55.952
We have a business proposal
for you.

08:55.994 --> 08:58.038
- I think there's been
some kind of mistake.

08:58.079 --> 08:59.664
I just own a saw palmetto farm.

08:59.706 --> 09:01.124
- Yeah, we fucking know.

09:01.166 --> 09:03.960
We used to run
the saw palmetto berry game.

09:04.002 --> 09:05.754
- Yeah, we'd pick
on public land

09:05.795 --> 09:07.881
and sell
to the supplement companies.

09:07.922 --> 09:09.966
[chuckles]
Easy money.

09:10.008 --> 09:11.259
- It's the best kind of money.

09:11.301 --> 09:12.594
- Yeah, but they cut us out

09:12.635 --> 09:15.388
by bribing the state
to change the laws.

09:15.430 --> 09:18.767
Now you have to own the land
where you get your berries.

09:18.808 --> 09:20.310
- And the supplement companies
bought up

09:20.352 --> 09:21.353
all the fucking swampland.

09:21.394 --> 09:23.605
- So here's
what we're proposing.

09:23.646 --> 09:26.608
We recently picked
a bunch of berries

09:26.649 --> 09:28.193
out in the Everglades.

09:28.234 --> 09:29.652
We would like to say

09:29.694 --> 09:31.905
that them berries come
from your farm.

09:31.946 --> 09:34.491
You sell them.
We split the profits.

09:34.532 --> 09:36.368
- 80/20.

09:36.409 --> 09:40.497
- So you want to launder
your berries through my farm.

09:40.538 --> 09:42.665
- You make it sound unseemly.

09:42.707 --> 09:45.460
We're just
small business owners,

09:45.502 --> 09:46.753
just like you.

09:46.795 --> 09:49.589
- What happens if I say no?

09:49.631 --> 09:53.009
- That's a conversation you can
have with Buttercup over there.

09:55.595 --> 09:56.930
[alligator farts]

09:56.971 --> 09:59.349
- Motherfucker!
It's the treats.

09:59.391 --> 10:01.393
- It's not the treats.

10:01.434 --> 10:03.895
She's just relaxed
'cause we're all together.

10:03.937 --> 10:08.650
- This is
definitely intriguing,

10:08.692 --> 10:11.986
but, um...

10:12.028 --> 10:13.697
I just worked so hard
to get where I am.

10:13.738 --> 10:15.323
I'd rather just keep it
aboveboard.

10:20.286 --> 10:22.664
- Man with a code.

10:22.706 --> 10:26.292
I can respect that.

10:26.334 --> 10:28.670
You want to drive Mr. Foster
back to his farm?

10:31.172 --> 10:34.050
[engine revs]

10:36.094 --> 10:38.430
- Craig! Where did you go?

10:38.471 --> 10:41.016
I had to entertain Nessa
for, like, 30 minutes.

10:41.057 --> 10:43.226
- They're here?
- She's a tough nut to crack.

10:43.268 --> 10:45.478
I asked her if she wanted
to see how easy it is

10:45.520 --> 10:47.647
to pair your phone
to the Kia's Bluetooth,

10:47.689 --> 10:49.816
and she just said "why?"

10:49.858 --> 10:51.151
- [chuckles]

10:51.192 --> 10:52.819
- Guess she's officially
a teenager.

10:52.861 --> 10:55.280
- Dad!
- Hey, hey, hey.

10:55.321 --> 10:56.990
Oh, that's my girl.

10:57.032 --> 10:58.825
Look at you.
You getting taller?

10:58.867 --> 11:00.994
You look taller.
- This place is so cool.

11:01.036 --> 11:03.079
Do you call it Henry Farms
because of Grandpa Henry?

11:03.121 --> 11:04.539
- Just wanted to honor
his memory.

11:04.581 --> 11:07.584
- That's so sweet.
You know what'd be sweeter?

11:07.625 --> 11:09.002
Nessa Farms.

11:09.044 --> 11:11.463
- Nessa Farms wasn't even
my second choice.

11:11.504 --> 11:12.922
Craig Farms was number two.

11:12.964 --> 11:14.507
Third place was Project Genesis

11:14.549 --> 11:15.508
'cause I thought
it sounded cool.

11:15.550 --> 11:16.760
- Hmm.
- Come on.

11:16.801 --> 11:18.178
Let me show you around.
Where's your mom?

11:18.219 --> 11:20.221
- She's in the car.
She needed the A/C.

11:20.263 --> 11:24.100
- In luxury cars like the Kia,
it's called climate control.

11:24.142 --> 11:27.729
- Hey, Camille. Come on.
I want to give you a tour.

11:29.397 --> 11:32.692
* *

11:32.734 --> 11:34.027
- [vocalizing]

11:34.069 --> 11:35.195
- I would've told you,

11:35.236 --> 11:36.529
but she wanted
to tell you first.

11:36.571 --> 11:38.907
- It's fine. It's--

11:40.742 --> 11:42.369
It's her life.
None of my business.

11:42.410 --> 11:44.120
I'm not even gonna ask
who the father is.

11:44.162 --> 11:46.539
- I didn't ask either
because I thought you would.

11:46.581 --> 11:48.041
Now we just don't get to know?

11:48.083 --> 11:51.127
- Oh, you're right.
That's insane.

11:51.169 --> 11:54.422
Whose is it?
Is it someone I know?

11:58.259 --> 12:00.470
- Not yours?
How's that make sense?

12:03.932 --> 12:05.308
- Why didn't I learn
sign language?

12:05.350 --> 12:07.143
I had a year.
- You're a surrogate?

12:07.185 --> 12:08.395
When did you decide to do this?

12:16.194 --> 12:18.405
- Dad, they're paying her
$60,000.

12:18.446 --> 12:20.615
- I don't understand.
Why do you need money?

12:20.657 --> 12:23.201
Didn't you just get a great job
in Oakland?

12:23.243 --> 12:25.453
Isn't that why our daughter
lives 3,000 miles away from me?

12:29.332 --> 12:31.209
- You know I'm doing well,
right?

12:31.251 --> 12:33.962
This is my farm that I own.

12:34.004 --> 12:37.382
We just had our first harvest.
We're about to get paid.

12:37.424 --> 12:40.552
We have an actual contract
with a supplement company.

12:40.593 --> 12:42.429
Next week,
we're delivering these berries

12:42.470 --> 12:44.764
and we're getting a lot more
than $60,000.

12:44.806 --> 12:46.057
We are thriving here!

12:46.099 --> 12:48.351
- Hello.
- Who are you?

12:48.393 --> 12:49.978
- Hi.
I'm with the state of Florida.

12:50.020 --> 12:51.312
We're shutting you down.

12:58.403 --> 12:59.988
- What do you mean,
you're shutting us down?

13:00.030 --> 13:02.365
- Well--
- Oh, hell yeah! Toilet police!

13:02.407 --> 13:04.325
- He's not here because of
the port-a-potties, Shayla.

13:04.367 --> 13:06.202
You're not, are you?
- No, sir.

13:06.244 --> 13:08.288
I'm with the Florida
Department of Agriculture.

13:08.329 --> 13:09.664
- Okay, but do you work
in the same building

13:09.706 --> 13:11.416
as the toilet police?
- No, ma'am.

13:11.458 --> 13:13.668
I'm just here about
the giant African land snails.

13:13.710 --> 13:15.170
They've been spotted
in the area.

13:15.211 --> 13:16.713
- Snails?
- What do you mean giant?

13:16.755 --> 13:19.007
- Well, these snails are
an invasive species

13:19.049 --> 13:20.300
that devour all plant life.

13:20.342 --> 13:21.926
They can destroy
entire ecosystems

13:21.968 --> 13:23.261
in a matter of months.

13:23.303 --> 13:25.013
Now, I know
what you're gonna say.

13:25.055 --> 13:26.723
"Sounds like my ex-wife."

13:26.765 --> 13:28.808
[laughs]

13:32.145 --> 13:33.605
We've been trained
to make light patter

13:33.646 --> 13:35.106
while we break bad news.

13:35.148 --> 13:37.067
I don't even have an ex-wife.

13:37.108 --> 13:38.276
Is the tension released?

13:38.318 --> 13:39.361
- No, the tension's
not released!

13:39.402 --> 13:40.528
The tension's
very fucking high!

13:40.570 --> 13:42.530
- We don't have giant snails
on our farm.

13:42.572 --> 13:45.700
- According to you,
but we still have to check.

13:45.742 --> 13:47.702
We're placing the entire area
under quarantine.

13:47.744 --> 13:48.995
Ten-mile radius.

13:49.037 --> 13:51.373
No agricultural materials
in or out

13:51.414 --> 13:53.041
until the snails are gone.
- No!

13:53.083 --> 13:54.501
Our first harvest goes out
next week.

13:54.542 --> 13:56.336
We need that payment
to keep us in business.

13:56.378 --> 13:57.420
- Dad, are you going
out of business?

13:57.462 --> 13:59.089
- No, we just have bills due.

14:00.924 --> 14:03.551
- All businesses take on debt
as they're starting out.

14:03.593 --> 14:04.886
I wish everyone understood
sign language

14:04.928 --> 14:06.680
'cause then they would see
that you bully me.

14:06.721 --> 14:08.973
- I'm sorry, but the snails
also carry meningitis.

14:09.015 --> 14:10.975
It can kill one in ten people
who are infected.

14:11.017 --> 14:13.395
- Well, do you know what else
you can get diseases from?

14:13.436 --> 14:15.563
Fecal matter.
- Shayla, get back to work.

14:15.605 --> 14:17.065
- Uh, work's canceled.
Haven't you heard?

14:17.107 --> 14:18.441
- Work's not canceled.

14:18.483 --> 14:20.819
- Are we going to get fired?
- Don't worry, guys.

14:20.860 --> 14:22.237
Even if they shut us down,

14:22.278 --> 14:24.572
I promise
you'll keep getting paid.

14:24.614 --> 14:27.951
And Margarita Monday
is still on.

14:27.992 --> 14:29.327
- You can't promise them that.

14:29.369 --> 14:31.162
- I already juiced
the limes, Craig.

14:31.204 --> 14:32.288
- Dad.

14:32.330 --> 14:33.415
- What can we do
to speed this up?

14:33.456 --> 14:35.083
- Ha, you sound like my ex-wife

14:35.125 --> 14:36.418
on our wedding night.

14:39.295 --> 14:42.048
There aren't usually children
at these.

14:42.090 --> 14:45.301
And there's nothing you can do
but let the process play out.

14:45.343 --> 14:48.430
Well, you folks have
a great day.

14:48.471 --> 14:50.056
- Just out of curiosity--

14:50.098 --> 14:51.641
not that I'd ever
break the law,

14:51.683 --> 14:53.560
but what would happen
if we just ignored you

14:53.601 --> 14:55.520
and drove off with our berries?

14:56.896 --> 14:58.982
- You couldn't
even if you wanted to.

14:59.024 --> 15:01.568
[dog barks]

15:01.609 --> 15:03.820
We're stopping every vehicle
in or out.

15:03.862 --> 15:05.071
- Yeah, good.

15:05.113 --> 15:07.866
That's why I was saying
I would never do it.

15:07.907 --> 15:09.909
Seems crazy you felt
you had bring us out here.

15:09.951 --> 15:11.494
- My partner and I will be
coming around

15:11.536 --> 15:13.621
to all the farms
one-by-one to inspect.

15:13.663 --> 15:16.583
We have to be thorough,
so it takes time.

15:16.624 --> 15:18.335
Give us
between two and ten days.

15:18.376 --> 15:20.503
- Fuck!
I mean, two days is fine.

15:20.545 --> 15:21.838
Hopefully it won't be ten.

15:26.134 --> 15:29.888
[tense music]

15:29.929 --> 15:31.806
Yo, what the hell, man?
Where you been?

15:31.848 --> 15:34.142
- I am so sorry.
I know that took forever.

15:34.184 --> 15:35.352
I've just had my hands full

15:35.393 --> 15:36.644
because my partner
killed himself.

15:36.686 --> 15:39.147
- Oh, my God.
- Did you see it coming?

15:39.189 --> 15:41.316
Were you the one who found him?

15:41.358 --> 15:42.776
How are you otherwise?

15:42.817 --> 15:44.652
I've never had
this conversation before.

15:44.694 --> 15:46.529
I don't know
what questions to ask.

15:46.571 --> 15:48.740
- You know what?
I shouldn't have brought it up.

15:48.782 --> 15:50.867
Today's about you
and your farm.

15:50.909 --> 15:53.203
Just don't ask me
what the note said.

15:54.996 --> 15:56.498
- What'd the note say?
- I wouldn't know.

15:56.539 --> 15:58.458
His wife won't let me read it,
which is fine.

15:58.500 --> 16:00.126
- All right, so--
- Really makes me feel like

16:00.168 --> 16:02.128
there's something about me
in there.

16:02.170 --> 16:03.630
I'm sorry.

16:03.672 --> 16:05.298
I'm not being
very professional, am I?

16:05.340 --> 16:06.383
- No, it's fine.
- Just our snail guy

16:06.424 --> 16:07.509
talking about suicide.
It's cool.

16:07.550 --> 16:09.010
- Look, I know you're anxious

16:09.052 --> 16:11.805
for the quarantine to be over,
but the good news is,

16:11.846 --> 16:13.515
I have a new partner

16:13.556 --> 16:17.018
who's really gonna help
speed things along.

16:17.060 --> 16:19.521
Okay. Meet Sally.
- Aww!

16:19.562 --> 16:21.398
- She's been specially trained
to detect

16:21.439 --> 16:23.108
giant African land snails

16:23.149 --> 16:24.984
with that cute little nose
of hers.

16:25.026 --> 16:28.071
She's also been trained
to detect suicidal ideation

16:28.113 --> 16:31.616
in her human companions,
so she's got an eye on me too.

16:31.658 --> 16:33.952
Nothing's gonna happen to me
with you around, is it?

16:33.993 --> 16:36.246
[in baby voice]
No, it's not. No, it's not.

16:36.287 --> 16:38.498
[kissing]
[chuckles]

16:38.540 --> 16:40.667
[in normal voice]
Now, I just need to let her

16:40.709 --> 16:42.627
get the scent of the snails

16:42.669 --> 16:45.005
so she knows
what she's tracking.

16:45.046 --> 16:47.924
- What the fuck?
- Oh, wow, the snail's so big.

16:47.966 --> 16:49.426
- Why is it that size?

16:49.467 --> 16:51.594
- Because it's a giant
African land snail.

16:51.636 --> 16:52.679
- It's fucking weird.

16:52.721 --> 16:54.556
- All right, Sal,
take a big whiff.

16:54.597 --> 16:56.641
- Oh, my God!
- She ate it!

16:56.683 --> 16:58.268
- Dogs don't get
meningitis, right?

16:58.309 --> 17:00.311
- Wrong.
It's so deadly for them.

17:00.353 --> 17:02.689
Why is this happening?
Come on, girl!

17:02.731 --> 17:03.690
- You still gotta do
the inspection!

17:03.732 --> 17:05.108
- Come on, get in the truck.

17:05.150 --> 17:07.152
- Hey, hey, we really need
this quarantine lifted.

17:07.193 --> 17:09.404
[engine turns over]
We're gonna lose everything!

17:09.446 --> 17:11.865
Hey, can we at least schedule
a follow-up?

17:11.906 --> 17:14.242
- Don't worry,
I'm sure the dog will be fine

17:14.284 --> 17:16.369
and he'll be right back.

17:17.370 --> 17:21.666
* *

17:21.708 --> 17:24.919
- [sighs]

17:24.961 --> 17:28.381
Well, the dog died.

17:28.423 --> 17:31.092
- Oh, my gosh. I'm so sorry.

17:31.134 --> 17:33.053
Are you okay?
- Nope.

17:36.473 --> 17:37.599
- So you want to get started

17:37.640 --> 17:38.767
with the inspection,
because the bank--

17:38.808 --> 17:40.894
- I actually didn't come
for an inspection.

17:40.935 --> 17:41.936
- Why are you here?

17:41.978 --> 17:43.021
- I thought
you might want to know

17:43.063 --> 17:44.564
what happened to Sally.

17:44.606 --> 17:46.483
You were the last people
to see her alive, you know?

17:46.524 --> 17:48.276
- That really is quite special.

17:48.318 --> 17:50.111
- As for me,

17:50.153 --> 17:52.405
I'm taking some time off
for my mental health.

17:52.447 --> 17:53.782
- The bank is gonna
take our farm.

17:53.823 --> 17:55.950
Can you send someone else
to do the inspection?

17:55.992 --> 17:57.619
- Well, no, it's my job,
so I shouldn't be punished

17:57.660 --> 17:59.412
for feeling sad.
- You should just get fired.

17:59.454 --> 18:00.663
- I'm sorry, what was that?

18:00.705 --> 18:02.123
I've been having
trouble hearing ever since

18:02.165 --> 18:04.250
the multiple traumatic events
I've experienced!

18:04.292 --> 18:05.669
- Healing takes time.

18:05.710 --> 18:08.380
We look forward to seeing you
whenever you feel ready.

18:08.421 --> 18:09.506
- Thank you.

18:11.841 --> 18:13.510
- So just, like,
a day or two, right?

18:13.551 --> 18:15.011
- Definitely, yeah.
Like a day or two.

18:17.013 --> 18:19.808
- How many mental health days
are you allowed to take?

18:19.849 --> 18:21.601
- Well, you're allowed to take
as many as you need,

18:21.643 --> 18:24.437
but you only get paid for ten,
so here I am.

18:24.479 --> 18:25.647
Let's find some snails.

18:25.689 --> 18:27.190
- No, we don't want
to find snails.

18:27.232 --> 18:28.400
That will ruin us.

18:28.441 --> 18:29.776
- I don't know,
maybe it would be better

18:29.818 --> 18:31.820
if we all just got meningitis
and died.

18:31.861 --> 18:33.655
- I think you need to get
another dog

18:33.697 --> 18:34.906
to keep an eye on you.

18:34.948 --> 18:36.741
- He can go pet shopping
after he inspects

18:36.783 --> 18:39.244
our fucking farm, Jillian.

18:39.285 --> 18:40.453
How long's this gonna take?

18:40.495 --> 18:41.996
- Well, usually it takes
about three hours.

18:42.038 --> 18:43.998
- Okay, three hours is fine.
- With a dog.

18:44.040 --> 18:45.625
If you accidentally killed
your dog,

18:45.667 --> 18:47.168
it takes a lot longer.

18:47.210 --> 18:48.503
Probably more like ten.

18:48.545 --> 18:50.422
- Just ten?
- Just ten.

18:50.463 --> 18:54.426
* *

18:54.467 --> 18:57.721
[exhales]

18:57.762 --> 18:59.222
- Hello, my man, we good?

18:59.264 --> 19:00.849
You get paid by
the fucking hour or something?

19:00.890 --> 19:04.060
Come on!

19:04.102 --> 19:06.062
- Okay, here's your report.

19:06.104 --> 19:08.023
No snails, no eggs,
no residue on berries.

19:08.064 --> 19:10.025
- That's it? We're done?
- You're done.

19:10.066 --> 19:11.943
- Thank you so much.
- I'm gonna call the bank.

19:11.985 --> 19:13.361
How soon can you lift
the quarantine?

19:13.403 --> 19:14.863
- Oh, that'll take months.

19:14.904 --> 19:16.281
Quarantine stays
until every farm

19:16.322 --> 19:17.532
in the area's been inspected.

19:17.574 --> 19:20.493
Yours was the first.

19:20.535 --> 19:22.620
You're welcome.

19:22.662 --> 19:23.788
- I hate you.

19:25.206 --> 19:27.208
- Craig, come in. Come in.

19:27.250 --> 19:29.044
- Mr. Franks, hey.

19:29.085 --> 19:31.880
- How long has it been?
- Uh, too long.

19:31.921 --> 19:35.550
- Yeah. Is this your daughter?

19:35.592 --> 19:38.303
- No.
This is my business partner.

19:38.345 --> 19:39.721
- Oh.
- You work here now?

19:39.763 --> 19:41.306
- Yeah, I had to transfer

19:41.348 --> 19:44.059
because of a misunderstanding
at the old branch.

19:44.100 --> 19:46.394
- What kind
of misunderstanding?

19:46.436 --> 19:48.355
- Doesn't matter.
This isn't about me.

19:48.396 --> 19:51.608
I assume you're here to talk
about your saw palmetto farm.

19:51.649 --> 19:54.527
I'm just so glad someone
gave you a loan for that.

19:54.569 --> 19:56.571
- Thank you, and we know
we're behind on payments,

19:56.613 --> 19:57.822
but it's really not our fault.

19:57.864 --> 20:00.575
- I was fired
for being too nice to women.

20:00.617 --> 20:02.118
Tell me how that makes sense.

20:03.453 --> 20:05.246
- It doesn't.
- It doesn't.

20:05.288 --> 20:07.290
Thank you. Go on.

20:07.332 --> 20:09.876
- Well, we've had a bit
of a delay with our berries,

20:09.918 --> 20:11.544
but they are totally safe.

20:11.586 --> 20:13.588
- Just like me.

20:13.630 --> 20:16.424
Did you know
that the average person needs

20:16.466 --> 20:18.218
eight hugs a day to be happy?

20:18.259 --> 20:20.720
And it doesn't have to be
from eight different people.

20:20.762 --> 20:22.681
It could be from the same man.

20:22.722 --> 20:23.723
- Mm.
- Interesting.

20:23.765 --> 20:25.308
- Mm-hmm. You were saying?

20:25.350 --> 20:28.770
- We just need one more
extension while the state--

20:28.812 --> 20:32.440
- And the only reason
I "targeted" female coworkers

20:32.482 --> 20:35.777
is because they were always
frowning when I walked by.

20:35.819 --> 20:38.029
- Mr. Franks,
this is very important to us.

20:38.071 --> 20:40.490
Can we please have
an extension?

20:40.532 --> 20:42.242
We just need two more months.

20:42.283 --> 20:45.245
- It seems like
you've been treated unfairly,

20:45.286 --> 20:48.039
and we have known each other
for so long.

20:48.081 --> 20:50.875
I'd love to help you.
[both laugh]

20:50.917 --> 20:54.921
But I'm already
on thin ice here.

20:54.963 --> 20:57.590
And even the risk
of appearing too nice,

20:57.632 --> 21:00.593
especially with such
a beautiful woman,

21:00.635 --> 21:02.846
it's just...
[groans]

21:02.887 --> 21:04.764
I can't.

21:04.806 --> 21:07.308
We'll begin foreclosure
next week.

21:07.350 --> 21:10.979
- [sighs]
- Oh, that face.

21:11.021 --> 21:14.315
You look like
you could use a hug.

21:14.357 --> 21:15.775
Come on.

21:15.817 --> 21:18.194
Come on. Up, up, up.

21:18.236 --> 21:21.031
Yeah. Oh.

21:21.072 --> 21:24.784
- Okay, that's--that's enough,
Mr. Franks.

21:24.826 --> 21:27.245
We gonna take off now,
Mr. Franks.

21:27.287 --> 21:29.497
- Okay.
- Mr. Franks.

21:29.539 --> 21:32.792
Hey, Zay, it's me. Again.

21:32.834 --> 21:34.961
Don't know if you're
getting these, but if you are,

21:35.003 --> 21:36.713
just wondering if maybe
you have an idea

21:36.755 --> 21:39.132
on how to sneak
10,000 pounds of berries

21:39.174 --> 21:41.634
past a fucking
military checkpoint.

21:41.676 --> 21:43.511
[sighs]

21:43.553 --> 21:45.430
I'm really fucked here, man.

21:45.472 --> 21:48.767
It would mean a lot to me
just to know you're all right.

21:48.808 --> 21:50.685
Even if you don't have an idea
about the berry thing,

21:50.727 --> 21:54.022
just give me a call.

21:54.064 --> 21:56.149
- Craig?

21:56.191 --> 21:58.193
Shayla had a question.

21:58.234 --> 21:59.319
- Are you aware how bad

21:59.361 --> 22:00.862
the port-a-potty situation
has gotten?

22:00.904 --> 22:01.863
Hmm?

22:01.905 --> 22:03.865
Smell's so foul,
it stings my eyes.

22:03.907 --> 22:05.658
Oh, and that Febreze
you put in there?

22:05.700 --> 22:07.744
- That was me.
- It's a fricking joke.

22:07.786 --> 22:10.914
"Bora Bora Waters" my ass.
- I'm so sorry.

22:10.955 --> 22:13.249
- Just call the shit truck
to suck out the poops.

22:17.420 --> 22:20.298
- Motherfucker.

22:20.340 --> 22:22.759
I know how we're gonna get
the berries out.

22:30.058 --> 22:31.726
- It's pretty standard stuff.

22:31.768 --> 22:33.395
This switch turns on
the vacuum.

22:33.436 --> 22:35.188
This lever dumps your cargo
from the bottom.

22:35.230 --> 22:36.940
- Wait, you finally caved?

22:36.981 --> 22:38.441
You're cleaning the shit pit?

22:38.483 --> 22:39.943
- Hey, you were right.

22:39.984 --> 22:41.444
I gotta empty it out more.

22:41.486 --> 22:44.155
- Wow. Thank you.

22:44.197 --> 22:46.366
Man, I know I've been a real
thorn in your sack on this one,

22:46.408 --> 22:48.284
but this is gonna make
a huge difference.

22:48.326 --> 22:50.620
A little dignity goes
a long way, Craig.

22:50.662 --> 22:51.746
You're a good boss.

22:51.788 --> 22:52.997
- Thanks, Shayla.

22:53.039 --> 22:54.749
Now get back to work.

22:54.791 --> 22:57.293
- [scoffs]

22:57.335 --> 22:59.629
- Wait, am I here
to empty the port-a-potty?

22:59.671 --> 23:01.673
I brought a fully sterilized
truck 'cause I thought

23:01.715 --> 23:03.383
you were gonna fill it
with berries or whatever.

23:03.425 --> 23:05.093
- Shh, keep your voice down.
Technically, we're not supposed

23:05.135 --> 23:06.845
to bring the berries
through the checkpoint.

23:06.886 --> 23:09.931
- Just so you know, our berries
don't have meningitis,

23:09.973 --> 23:11.349
so they're not gonna
kill anyone.

23:11.391 --> 23:13.268
- Ma'am, I don't know
what you're talking about,

23:13.309 --> 23:15.228
and honestly, I don't care.

23:15.270 --> 23:17.647
Just give me my 2 grand,
and for the next four hours,

23:17.689 --> 23:18.773
you can kill whoever you want.

23:18.815 --> 23:19.941
- No, we're not gonna
kill anyone.

23:19.983 --> 23:22.527
- I don't care.

23:22.569 --> 23:23.862
Just give me my money.

23:23.903 --> 23:26.740
- And you're sure the dogs
won't smell the berries?

23:26.781 --> 23:28.450
- That's triple-wall steel.

23:28.491 --> 23:29.659
No odors in or out.

23:29.701 --> 23:30.827
- And the paperwork's in there?

23:30.869 --> 23:32.037
- Yeah, everything's
in the truck.

23:32.078 --> 23:34.205
- And how did you get
into this business?

23:34.247 --> 23:36.166
What was your journey?
- Jillian.

23:36.207 --> 23:37.751
- What?
- It's research.

23:37.792 --> 23:39.377
What if the guards start asking
questions at the checkpoint?

23:39.419 --> 23:40.545
- You think
they're gonna ask us

23:40.587 --> 23:42.088
about our journey
into the shit business?

23:42.130 --> 23:44.174
- It's actually kind of
an interesting story.

23:44.215 --> 23:47.177
So my dad went to high school
with Hulk Hogan--

23:47.218 --> 23:48.470
- We don't have time for this,
Steve Jr.

23:48.511 --> 23:49.387
Thank you for your truck.

23:52.474 --> 23:55.310
Why is this so difficult?
Jesus!

23:55.352 --> 23:57.687
- You think if we both
didn't have dead dads,

23:57.729 --> 23:59.481
we'd know how to drive a truck?

23:59.522 --> 24:01.358
- Jillian--

24:01.399 --> 24:02.359
maybe.

24:02.400 --> 24:03.860
- Paperwork.

24:03.902 --> 24:07.906
- Uh, there you go.

24:07.947 --> 24:09.366
- Can you open up
the tank, sir?

24:09.407 --> 24:11.534
- Yes, I can,
but it dumps from the bottom,

24:11.576 --> 24:13.036
and if I release it,
there'll be a bunch

24:13.078 --> 24:14.412
of fecal matter on the road.

24:14.454 --> 24:15.955
I mean,
if that's what you want...

24:17.916 --> 24:19.668
- That won't be necessary.
- Mm.

24:19.709 --> 24:22.295
- So you're Steve Jr.

24:22.337 --> 24:25.006
- That's correct.
The Wonderful Wizard of Waste.

24:25.048 --> 24:26.549
- Hey, can I ask you something?
- Hmm.

24:26.591 --> 24:29.928
- How'd you get
into this line of work?

24:29.969 --> 24:31.429
- Well, my father...

24:31.471 --> 24:33.682
- His dad went to high school
with Hulk Hogan.

24:33.723 --> 24:35.350
- Right.
- Oh, really?

24:35.392 --> 24:38.937
- Yes, so my dad
and Hulk Hogan, they were--

24:38.978 --> 24:42.065
- Both in love
with the same girl.

24:42.107 --> 24:43.400
- Right.
They were both in love--

24:43.441 --> 24:46.069
- And then they got
into an ultimate prank war,

24:46.111 --> 24:48.405
but it went too far.

24:48.446 --> 24:50.573
- Jillian,
I'm trying to tell the story

24:50.615 --> 24:52.158
as quickly as possible.

24:52.200 --> 24:55.286
- I don't know why.
It's really interesting.

24:55.328 --> 24:58.581
- Well, my dad and Hulk were
always topping each other--

24:58.623 --> 24:59.916
like, in the prank war.

24:59.958 --> 25:02.210
- Incoming!
[car horn honking]

25:02.252 --> 25:04.212
- Stop that shit truck!

25:04.254 --> 25:07.132
[tense music]

25:07.173 --> 25:08.717
* *

25:08.758 --> 25:10.135
Don't let him leave.

25:10.176 --> 25:12.262
- Don't let her see us.
Don't let her see us.

25:12.303 --> 25:13.555
- This guy was supposed
to fucking empty

25:13.596 --> 25:14.973
the port-a-potty,
but he didn't.

25:15.015 --> 25:16.641
It's still full.
It's fucking brimming.

25:16.683 --> 25:18.268
- Ma'am, get back in the car.
- Get the fuck out of my way.

25:18.309 --> 25:19.853
"Wizard of Waste" my ass.

25:19.894 --> 25:21.980
Listen, you motherf--

25:22.022 --> 25:23.565
Craig?
- Hi, Shayla.

25:23.606 --> 25:25.358
- Why are you driving
the shit truck?

25:25.400 --> 25:26.401
- Craig?

25:26.443 --> 25:27.777
I thought your name
was Steve Jr.

25:27.819 --> 25:29.195
- Craig's his last name.

25:29.237 --> 25:31.990
His first name is Steve Jr.
Steve Jr. Craig.

25:32.032 --> 25:33.950
- Sir, ma'am,
I'm gonna have to ask you

25:33.992 --> 25:35.160
to step out of the vehicle.

25:35.201 --> 25:38.830
* *

25:38.872 --> 25:40.248
- So what are you gonna do now?

25:40.290 --> 25:41.624
- I don't know.

25:41.666 --> 25:44.461
I can't stay in Miami.
Too many ghosts.

25:44.502 --> 25:46.838
Maybe I'll travel,
learn an instrument.

25:46.880 --> 25:48.214
- What are you gonna do
about us?

25:48.256 --> 25:51.217
- Oh, well, you tried
to break quarantine,

25:51.259 --> 25:53.636
so you'll have to pay
the largest fine

25:53.678 --> 25:55.972
the state of Florida can levy
