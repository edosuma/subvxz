<i>There are some
rare people in this world,</i>

00:36.356 --> 00:40.227
<i>who can make absolutely
anything into an adventure.</i>

00:41.595 --> 00:44.030
Come on, Kelley. Come on.

00:46.999 --> 00:48.666
<i>If we're lucky,</i>

00:48.668 --> 00:53.339
<i>one of those fearless, generous
souls shows us how it's done.</i>

00:55.207 --> 00:56.208
<i>How to live.</i>

01:00.580 --> 01:05.116
<i>Except, sometimes
it doesn't feel like luck.</i>

01:05.117 --> 01:08.353
<i>Sometimes it feels like
they were sent from above</i>

01:08.355 --> 01:10.123
<i>as a gift to the rest of us.</i>

01:15.794 --> 01:18.395
<i>Because when someone like
that finds you,</i>

01:18.397 --> 01:22.001
<i>and somehow chooses you
as their friend,</i>

01:24.137 --> 01:26.506
<i>it makes you think
that you can fly.</i>

01:35.615 --> 01:36.880
Okay, thanks.

01:36.882 --> 01:39.417
<i>Or, at the very least,</i>

01:39.419 --> 01:41.386
<i>it helps you get
through high school.</i>

01:41.388 --> 01:45.523
<i>Which, when you're 17,
is kind of everything.</i>

01:45.525 --> 01:46.591
Kell Bell!

01:46.593 --> 01:48.359
Kelley!

01:49.764 --> 01:51.162
<i>Of course, it was Line,</i>

01:51.164 --> 01:54.098
<i>who always seemed like
she was about to take flight,</i>

01:54.100 --> 01:57.502
<i>like she might bound
out of her seat at any moment.</i>

02:07.346 --> 02:08.347
Hey.

02:09.616 --> 02:11.481
Ladies and gentlemen,

02:11.483 --> 02:14.787
the anchor of West High's
starting line-up,

02:14.789 --> 02:16.988
Miss Kelley Fliehler!

02:16.990 --> 02:19.957
Shut up, Line,
you're gonna jinx me!

02:19.959 --> 02:22.260
Can't jinx certainties, Kell.

02:22.262 --> 02:24.895
No, you being a starter
is a certainty.

02:24.897 --> 02:28.800
Me being a starter
is, like, 50-50 at best.

02:28.802 --> 02:30.934
Think about it. This year we
have Mack,

02:30.936 --> 02:34.037
Brie, and that freshman,
who's like nine feet tall.

02:34.039 --> 02:35.505
They're not you.

02:35.507 --> 02:37.075
- Please.
- I'm serious!

02:37.077 --> 02:40.078
Tell me you haven't been
killing it in practice.

02:40.080 --> 02:42.980
Okay. I made a couple
of good digs.

02:42.982 --> 02:45.216
"A couple good digs."

02:45.218 --> 02:47.620
Let me just kick
your butt right now.

02:48.588 --> 02:51.955
No, after we win State, again.

02:55.595 --> 02:59.664

02:59.666 --> 03:03.769

03:18.618 --> 03:20.917
Whoa. Hello, new neighbor.

03:24.190 --> 03:25.959
Oh, no!

03:28.328 --> 03:32.098
Easy, Liner! We can't play
at all if we have whiplash.

03:32.665 --> 03:34.599
- No.
- Oh, yes.

03:34.601 --> 03:36.933
No, no, no.

03:36.935 --> 03:39.570
No. Liner, get back here.

03:39.572 --> 03:41.037
The party's tomorrow night.

03:41.039 --> 03:44.207
Officially it's to celebrate
the start of volleyball.

03:44.209 --> 03:46.042
We've got a pre-season game
in, like, an hour.

03:46.044 --> 03:47.678
But you guys should come
meet people.

03:47.680 --> 03:50.281
We invited the whole school.
Literally.

03:50.283 --> 03:52.183
Just tell us you're coming,
even if it's a lie.

03:52.185 --> 03:55.321
Because this one
can't take no for an answer.

03:56.423 --> 03:58.922
Well, in that case,
we'll be there.

03:58.924 --> 04:00.926
On one condition.

04:01.927 --> 04:03.126
What's your name?

04:03.128 --> 04:05.195
Ruby. And that's
my big brother, Alex.

04:05.197 --> 04:07.063
That's it, you're in.

04:07.065 --> 04:10.568
You look like you got what it takes to be
a West High volleyball player someday.

04:10.570 --> 04:12.071
- All right.
- Up top.

04:12.405 --> 04:13.672
Yeah!

04:13.674 --> 04:15.940
Yeah!

04:15.942 --> 04:18.409
Um, it's the big red barn
just off of Route 1.

04:18.411 --> 04:20.577
- You can't miss it.
- Looking forward to it.

04:20.579 --> 04:23.481
Well, that is,
if I'm not lying about coming.

04:25.485 --> 04:26.486
Kell Bell!

04:27.153 --> 04:29.121
Ugh.

04:31.724 --> 04:33.323
- You're welcome.
- Mmm.

04:33.325 --> 04:35.294
We can double date.

04:36.396 --> 04:37.696
No!

04:40.935 --> 04:42.168
There he is.

04:43.503 --> 04:44.903
Hey, Jim.

04:44.905 --> 04:46.070
What do you say, girls?

04:46.072 --> 04:47.138
- Fresh off the press.
- These are perfect!

04:47.140 --> 04:49.874
- I love that.
- Wait, this is for you.

04:49.876 --> 04:51.776
- We'll see you after.
- Thank you, Jim.

04:51.778 --> 04:53.043
Oh, thank you.

04:53.045 --> 04:54.345
- First game tonight.
- Whoo!

04:54.347 --> 04:56.581
Thank you, guys. Here you go.
First game.

04:56.583 --> 04:58.281
First game. West is the best!

04:58.283 --> 05:00.284
- A piece... Perfect!
- Right here.

05:00.286 --> 05:03.054
- All right, let's keep it going. Yeah.
- Whoo! Beautiful!

05:03.056 --> 05:04.989
- I'm on my last one.
- Oh, no.

05:04.991 --> 05:06.524
Gotta catch up.

05:06.526 --> 05:08.092
Hey, Kelley. Hey, Liner.

05:08.094 --> 05:09.193
- Candy.
- Hi!

05:09.195 --> 05:10.728
Oh, wow.
Those turned out great.

05:10.730 --> 05:12.797
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

05:12.799 --> 05:15.566
- Oh, my God.
- That looks so amazing.

05:15.568 --> 05:17.869
You girls bring that
championship back home again.

05:17.871 --> 05:19.269
- We will.
- We will.

05:19.271 --> 05:22.473
Give this to your mama,
it's her favorite. How is she?

05:22.475 --> 05:23.508
Great.

05:23.510 --> 05:25.409
You give her a great big hug
from me.

05:25.411 --> 05:26.344
Will do.

05:26.346 --> 05:28.212
And thanks for this.
It looks delicious.

05:28.214 --> 05:29.882
- You're welcome.
- Thank you, Candy.

05:29.884 --> 05:31.415
You're welcome.
Good to see you girls.

05:31.417 --> 05:32.418
You, too.

05:36.155 --> 05:37.790
You wanna talk about it?

05:39.092 --> 05:41.227
Forty-two matches till State,
Kell Bell.

05:41.861 --> 05:43.061
Yeah.

06:06.953 --> 06:08.619
Wait!

06:08.621 --> 06:10.423
Wait!

06:11.558 --> 06:12.626
Wait!

06:17.463 --> 06:18.598
Hey!

06:19.432 --> 06:20.433
Wait!

06:28.775 --> 06:31.644
I don't know why they didn't
take it, but they didn't.

06:32.912 --> 06:34.912
For gosh sakes, it's yours.

06:34.914 --> 06:36.682
I never liked it.
I don't want it.

06:36.684 --> 06:38.984
Why don't you and what's her
name use it?

06:38.986 --> 06:41.252
- Brez!
- I left it in the yard.

06:41.254 --> 06:42.821
Brez, we gotta talk.

06:42.823 --> 06:44.355
Who else?
I moved it myself.

06:44.357 --> 06:45.824
- Who else is gonna help me?
- Super urgent.

06:45.826 --> 06:46.992
Caroline, hold on.

06:46.994 --> 06:48.459
That dresser
is in the yard.

06:48.461 --> 06:50.328
Take it if you want it,
or I'm throwing it on...

06:50.330 --> 06:51.662
- Brez...
- What?

06:51.664 --> 06:54.665
Okay. First of all, I have
a special surprise for you

06:54.667 --> 06:57.802
after the game.
You're gonna love it. Also,

06:57.804 --> 06:59.838
- the team picture.
- Oh, my God. Are you still talking?

06:59.840 --> 07:02.074
- Uh-huh.
- Remember when I said we should be wearing matching socks?

07:02.076 --> 07:04.141
I actually think
they shouldn't match.

07:04.143 --> 07:07.012
Maybe we wear neon colors
and weird hats.

07:07.014 --> 07:09.280
Or, maybe we match
our shoe laces.

07:09.282 --> 07:11.482
- It's gonna be a great year.
- Oh, yeah.

07:11.484 --> 07:13.551
Magical season,
I can feel it.

07:13.553 --> 07:17.323
- Did someone say "magic"?
- That's my cue.

07:19.092 --> 07:20.760
Where's it gonna come from?

07:24.197 --> 07:25.398
Come here.

07:25.799 --> 07:27.532
Oh!

07:27.534 --> 07:31.103
- You have a date with Mom tonight?
- And every night, sweetheart.

07:31.105 --> 07:32.503
After the game,

07:32.505 --> 07:35.907
and I have a consult with
a guy about a herniated disc.

07:35.909 --> 07:38.609
Why? You thinking about
crashing the party again?

07:38.611 --> 07:40.611
Well, it's not like you're
getting lucky.

07:41.781 --> 07:44.248
You're not, right, Dad?

07:44.250 --> 07:47.485
Don't answer that.
Definitely don't answer that.

07:48.822 --> 07:50.456
You're the grossest!

07:52.626 --> 07:53.627
Love you!

07:56.696 --> 07:58.429
Go! Go! Go!

07:58.431 --> 08:00.899
Oh, my God,
that's so disgusting!

08:00.901 --> 08:03.167
- Don't encourage her.
- Come on, you can do it!

08:03.169 --> 08:05.538
Get the next one.
Get the next one.

08:06.506 --> 08:09.440
What the heck
is going on here?

08:09.442 --> 08:12.144
Line ordered pizza
for some reason,

08:12.146 --> 08:14.311
and then bet me she could
jam two whole slices

08:14.313 --> 08:15.747
in her mouth at once.

08:19.053 --> 08:20.253
With me.

08:21.554 --> 08:22.753
You killed it!

08:24.757 --> 08:26.724
Urgh!

08:26.726 --> 08:27.827
You're gross.

08:35.736 --> 08:36.937
Take your time.

08:38.304 --> 08:40.972
Are you sure you don't want any?
It's so good.

08:40.974 --> 08:41.975
Give it to me.

08:47.747 --> 08:50.481
Okay. That was just a bet,
which I totally would've won.

08:50.483 --> 08:52.450
Caroline, you're
the captain now.

08:52.452 --> 08:55.052
Do you not understand
what being a captain is?

08:55.054 --> 08:57.321
Call me "Line" or "Liner"
or any curse word you want.

08:57.323 --> 09:00.392
- But just not "Caroline".
- My setter leads.

09:00.394 --> 09:02.527
- It's just pizza.
- These girls are looking at you,

09:02.529 --> 09:04.896
our best player,
to set the tone.

09:04.898 --> 09:07.531
- We were just having a little fun.
- Not to be their best friend,

09:07.533 --> 09:10.701
not to be the funniest,
but to lead this team.

09:10.703 --> 09:12.470
Are you feeling
all right today, Brez?

09:12.472 --> 09:14.172
- What?
- You need a hug?

09:14.174 --> 09:16.174
- No.
- Can't play knowing you're upset.

09:16.176 --> 09:17.376
Come here.

09:19.245 --> 09:22.548
- See? Isn't this so nice?
- Yeah.

09:23.851 --> 09:24.852
Get outta here.

09:26.787 --> 09:28.622
Hey. I got you.

09:33.392 --> 09:35.459
This was fun to get,
wasn't it?

09:35.461 --> 09:37.862
Yeah!

09:37.864 --> 09:41.699
How many schools in Iowa do
you think have one of these?

09:41.701 --> 09:44.136
- Freshman?
- My name's Taylor.

09:44.138 --> 09:45.536
I know your name. Freshman?

09:45.538 --> 09:48.540
Dozens. Scores, even.

09:48.542 --> 09:52.043
But how many teams
have earned two back-to-back?

09:52.045 --> 09:54.345
Almost none. You know why?

09:54.347 --> 09:56.347
'Cause players get cocky.

09:56.349 --> 09:57.949
- What?
- What?

09:57.951 --> 10:00.018
They get complacent.

10:00.020 --> 10:01.652
So, say goodbye.

10:01.654 --> 10:04.588
It's not yours anymore.
It belongs to last year's team.

10:04.590 --> 10:06.857
I don't want you to think
about being ranked number one.

10:06.859 --> 10:09.460
I want you to think about
what we're gonna do

10:09.462 --> 10:11.897
this year, today.

10:11.899 --> 10:14.065
Which is, one point at a time

10:14.067 --> 10:17.303
we're gonna play
West volleyball.

10:19.173 --> 10:21.041
Captain, team is yours.

10:22.743 --> 10:24.341
Yeah, Liner.

10:24.343 --> 10:26.712
Yeah, State, here we come!

10:29.249 --> 10:32.550
<i>And here they come!</i>

10:32.552 --> 10:36.054
<i>Your defending State Champions,
the West High Trojans.</i>

10:36.056 --> 10:39.724
<i>Today, West will take on their
crosstown rival, City High.</i>

10:42.996 --> 10:46.765
Is it me, or did the Twin Towers
get taller over the summer?

10:46.767 --> 10:51.036
It's you. Or it's that good
old steroid-fed Iowa beef.

10:51.038 --> 10:55.007
All right. Focus on the game.
Focus on the game.

10:57.144 --> 10:58.711
They are huge.

11:01.715 --> 11:05.719
Nice girls, but it's time
to take them down!

11:17.231 --> 11:19.632
Right girls.
We got this ladies!

11:30.476 --> 11:32.509
Ball's up, ball's up!

11:32.511 --> 11:34.645
Yeah, watch out,
watch out, yeah, it's coming.

11:34.647 --> 11:36.149
Middle! Middle! Middle!

11:37.284 --> 11:38.852
Yeah. Here, here, here.

11:39.186 --> 11:40.453
Hands up.

11:42.822 --> 11:43.990
Yeah!

11:46.893 --> 11:48.862
Great choice, Line. Yes!

11:51.431 --> 11:52.766
All right. Do it again.
Do it again.

11:53.767 --> 11:55.367
Great play, guys.
Let's keep it going.

11:55.369 --> 11:56.637
Get ready for
the next one, okay?

11:59.273 --> 12:01.842
Yes! Middle!

12:05.178 --> 12:07.544
Let's go, guys.

12:07.546 --> 12:10.282
- Get it back.
- Gotta be on top of that.

12:10.284 --> 12:11.650
Look who's going down now.

12:11.652 --> 12:15.022
Hey, pick your head up.
Pick your head up.

12:17.691 --> 12:20.027
I would've missed that one, too.
We'll get them next, okay?

12:25.531 --> 12:28.066
Do work today, son!

12:28.068 --> 12:29.867
Come on, Kelley.
You got this, Kell.

12:29.869 --> 12:31.604
You got this.

12:47.453 --> 12:51.158
<i>What a disappointment for
West as City takes the first set.</i>

12:53.526 --> 12:55.828
Come on, guys. Next one, yeah?

12:56.330 --> 12:57.561
Have a seat.

12:57.563 --> 12:59.096
Brie, get out there.

12:59.098 --> 13:01.367
It's okay, Kell.
Don't worry about it.

13:01.369 --> 13:04.202
Come on, ladies. We got this!
Hands up!

13:04.204 --> 13:06.139
Hey... Mmm-hmm.

13:08.608 --> 13:09.876
Okay, let's go.

13:12.746 --> 13:14.047
Got it, got it, got it!

13:16.749 --> 13:18.718
Yeah, Brie! Yeah, Brie!

13:21.121 --> 13:22.320
Brie, you okay?

13:22.322 --> 13:23.991
Yeah, I'm fine.

13:24.858 --> 13:26.493
Freshman, you're in.

13:29.496 --> 13:30.764
Way to commit.

13:33.667 --> 13:35.802
Come on, guys!
You got this!

13:42.943 --> 13:44.209
Ball's up!

14:00.260 --> 14:02.160
All right, West.

14:02.162 --> 14:04.628
<i>A heartbreaker
for the women of Troy</i>

14:04.630 --> 14:06.900
<i>who just couldn't
get much going today.</i>

14:08.268 --> 14:09.935
Good game.
Good game.

14:13.006 --> 14:14.172
Caroline...

14:15.443 --> 14:18.111
Ernie, sorry. How are you?

14:19.980 --> 14:24.251
- Sorry. That's a dumb question.
- No, Brez, it's okay.

14:25.752 --> 14:27.786
We're hanging in there.

14:27.788 --> 14:30.989
So, um, Caroline is throwing

14:30.991 --> 14:32.656
one of her parties
tomorrow night,

14:32.658 --> 14:36.628
and I know you don't
really like to socialize,

14:36.630 --> 14:39.631
but with what's going on,

14:39.633 --> 14:41.966
I know she'd love
you to be there.

14:41.968 --> 14:43.970
Great. I'll try to make it.

14:44.905 --> 14:46.706
It's good to see you, Ernie.

14:50.277 --> 14:53.845
- She is not coming.
- No, not in a million years.

14:59.052 --> 15:00.852
Oh, my God!

15:00.854 --> 15:02.854
Am I the only one pissed off

15:02.856 --> 15:05.223
about losing a game
we should've won?

15:05.225 --> 15:06.624
We know we sucked, Brez.

15:06.626 --> 15:08.626
We did. And now we're
just letting it go.

15:08.628 --> 15:10.195
You know what I'm gonna
be letting go of?

15:10.197 --> 15:12.263
Players who cannot compete.

15:12.265 --> 15:15.168
Pull it together out there,
Fliehler. All of you.

15:17.971 --> 15:18.972
Hey.

15:20.873 --> 15:22.908
Don't worry about it. Okay?

15:26.180 --> 15:28.646
<i>Ew! You better not kiss!</i>

15:28.648 --> 15:29.850
<i>That's a dare.</i>

15:32.252 --> 15:34.319
<i>Gross!</i>

15:34.321 --> 15:35.854
Some things never change.

15:35.856 --> 15:38.556
She said the same thing to me
this afternoon.

15:47.602 --> 15:50.068
After all these years,

15:50.070 --> 15:51.305
we still got it.

15:55.576 --> 15:57.811
We're gonna get
you stronger, Ellyn.

15:59.079 --> 16:02.382
We're gonna walk up
Mount Monadnock next year.

16:10.956 --> 16:12.692
Yeah, that's good.

16:17.398 --> 16:19.898
I got a present for you.

16:19.900 --> 16:21.201
Oh?

16:27.541 --> 16:30.608
Oh, I love these.

16:30.610 --> 16:33.478
And I'm gonna wear them
for you every time I play.

16:34.780 --> 16:36.382
The game today meant nothing.

16:36.384 --> 16:40.653
We're gonna win State again,
and we're gonna do it for you.

16:40.655 --> 16:41.855
You'll see.

16:43.823 --> 16:46.324
We talked about this, honey.

16:46.326 --> 16:49.462
Odds are, I won't be here
for the whole season.

16:53.733 --> 16:55.035
Sweetheart.

17:02.876 --> 17:06.545
Since when did odds
ever matter to me?

17:06.547 --> 17:10.714
You are coming
to my graduation, Mama.

17:10.717 --> 17:14.154
You are moving me into
my dorm room next year.

17:14.854 --> 17:16.054
And better yet,

17:16.056 --> 17:19.925
you are going to dance
at my wedding.

17:23.598 --> 17:25.799
Am I making myself clear?

17:28.169 --> 17:29.237
Very clear.

17:29.769 --> 17:32.003
Good.

17:32.005 --> 17:38.910
Meanwhile, I am going to climb
into your IV drip,

17:38.912 --> 17:42.180
and spread gooey Liner love
in your bloodstream,

17:42.182 --> 17:46.386
till it spreads to every
single cell in your body.

17:47.488 --> 17:50.055
So, no matter what,

17:50.057 --> 17:52.025
we're always
going to be together.

17:54.528 --> 17:55.996
I'll take it.

17:57.465 --> 17:59.598
I'll take all of it.

18:10.710 --> 18:12.013
Woo!

18:12.846 --> 18:14.413
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa.

18:14.415 --> 18:15.281
Whose is that?

18:15.283 --> 18:18.517
Quiet, quiet, quiet.
Here, take these.

18:18.519 --> 18:20.753
Brandon Turner's brother
has just left for college

18:20.755 --> 18:22.320
and didn't take this with him.

18:22.322 --> 18:23.555
Can you believe that?

18:23.557 --> 18:25.123
Your dad is gonna kill you.

18:25.125 --> 18:27.294
Not if he doesn't
happen to notice.

18:28.395 --> 18:30.030
Perfect.

18:32.499 --> 18:33.765
I never saw it.

18:33.767 --> 18:35.768
- I'll totally deny it.
- Deny what?

18:35.770 --> 18:37.071
I didn't see anything.

18:40.341 --> 18:41.342
How's that?

18:43.744 --> 18:46.514
- No. Still nothing over here.
- Oh, man.

18:47.847 --> 18:49.814
This is a huge party foul, Dad.

18:49.816 --> 18:51.318
Almost there.

18:52.419 --> 18:53.887
Wait! Hang on.

19:03.597 --> 19:05.533
The party has started!

19:21.681 --> 19:23.317
I'm gonna go play a game.

19:35.563 --> 19:37.163
- Looking good.
- Ah!

19:38.632 --> 19:41.067
Well, it looked good anyway.
But...

19:41.602 --> 19:43.167
No thanks to you.

19:43.169 --> 19:47.206
But you know what? I think,
I can actually make this work

19:47.208 --> 19:51.577
if I just make this an
exclamation point.

19:51.579 --> 19:52.580
Nice.

19:54.315 --> 19:55.516
Excuse me.

19:56.250 --> 19:57.251
Yeah.

20:07.660 --> 20:10.063
Lizzy B, take the top card.

20:11.599 --> 20:13.100
Is that the card?

20:14.402 --> 20:15.701
Yes.

20:15.703 --> 20:17.569
- Yeah, it is.
- It is?

20:19.240 --> 20:21.473
Dude, that wasn't your card.
You had the queen of hearts.

20:21.475 --> 20:22.907
Mrs. Found is really sick.

20:22.909 --> 20:24.410
He could've said a potato
chip was my card,

20:24.412 --> 20:26.680
and I would've agreed.
Now, clap.

20:27.882 --> 20:29.280
Okay.

20:29.282 --> 20:32.150
You think that's the card?

20:32.152 --> 20:33.752
I have a funny feeling.

20:33.754 --> 20:36.555
Ruby, would you pick this up

20:36.557 --> 20:38.292
and set it aside?

20:39.860 --> 20:41.328
- My goodness.
- What?

20:43.297 --> 20:45.597
No! What?

20:45.599 --> 20:47.699
It's my card!

20:47.701 --> 20:49.333
How did you do that?

20:49.335 --> 20:50.869
This is my card!

20:50.871 --> 20:52.336
Will you please
do another one?

20:52.338 --> 20:54.706
It's late for any more
magic tonight.

20:54.708 --> 20:58.878
The magician has to get up
in a few hours and go to work.

21:00.381 --> 21:03.350
- Ever sawed someone in half?
- Only redheads.

21:05.453 --> 21:08.322
No, I'm more about
putting people together.

21:09.523 --> 21:11.222
Good night, ladies.

21:11.224 --> 21:13.358
- Good night, Dad.
- Good night.

21:13.360 --> 21:17.428
Okay, so, I'm gonna go
sneak a visit with my mom,

21:17.430 --> 21:19.898
but I have to know,

21:19.900 --> 21:23.168
- did you kiss the new guy or what?
- No!

21:23.170 --> 21:26.572
Not yet. But I think
it's, like, a possibility.

21:26.574 --> 21:29.143
What? Awesome!

21:29.944 --> 21:31.543
Weight room tomorrow,
7:00 a.m.

21:31.545 --> 21:33.479
No. No way,
I'm sleeping in tomorrow.

21:33.481 --> 21:37.382
- Early birds become starters.
- Ugh, okay, fine.

21:37.384 --> 21:38.486
7:00 a.m.

21:43.990 --> 21:47.125
This is our year, Kell.

21:47.127 --> 21:49.530
- Our year.
- Bye.

21:50.865 --> 21:52.233
See you tomorrow.

21:56.704 --> 21:58.403
Woo!

21:58.405 --> 21:59.406
Yeah!

22:16.690 --> 22:17.691
Hey, Bob.

22:19.493 --> 22:21.660
What is it?
You got a noise complaint?

22:21.662 --> 22:24.663
We don't keep anything up
around here except the sheep.

22:24.665 --> 22:27.200
I'm afraid we have some
terrible news for you, Ernie.

22:28.101 --> 22:30.002
What do you mean?

22:30.004 --> 22:32.704
- There's been an accident.
- Who?

22:32.706 --> 22:34.138
It's Caroline.

26:32.679 --> 26:35.380
I'd like to have
a moment of silence,

in honor of senior
Caroline Found,

26:38.352 --> 26:40.822

<i>Door's always open...</i>

28:13.581 --> 28:15.181
Unless the girls come to you
and want to play...

28:15.183 --> 28:17.149
They can barely brush
their teeth in the morning.

28:17.151 --> 28:19.419
- They're not gonna come...
- Then it's too soon.

28:19.954 --> 28:21.320
Brez...

28:21.322 --> 28:22.754
You gotta think about
their mental health.

28:22.756 --> 28:25.490
I'm holding practice
tomorrow afternoon at 3:45.

28:25.492 --> 28:27.594

Japanese eat like this.

29:18.313 --> 29:19.846
Like to lay it all out.

29:20.914 --> 29:23.115
Get a look at the whole
lunch landscape.

29:23.117 --> 29:24.852
What are you doing, Coach?

29:27.855 --> 29:29.554
My alarm went off
this morning.

29:29.556 --> 29:31.826
Like it always does. 5:59.

29:33.527 --> 29:35.560
Rolled right back over.

29:35.562 --> 29:37.762
Didn't want to get out of bed.

29:37.764 --> 29:41.367
Then I heard this annoying
voice in my head.

29:41.369 --> 29:43.003
Caroline's voice.

29:44.705 --> 29:46.472
"Do work today, son!"

29:49.377 --> 29:51.576
With everything going
on in her life,

29:51.578 --> 29:53.114
she played volleyball.

29:55.582 --> 29:57.551
I think we need
to play volleyball.

29:58.119 --> 29:59.318
Now?

29:59.320 --> 30:00.554
Now.

30:02.589 --> 30:05.957
- Why me?
- You're her best friend.

30:05.959 --> 30:08.893
Girls are looking at you to see
if it's okay to play again.

30:08.895 --> 30:12.631
Please, don't put this
on me, Brez.

30:12.633 --> 30:15.169
Sorry. I just did.

30:25.746 --> 30:28.216
We're talking. Every night.

30:29.549 --> 30:31.583
So pick up your phone.

30:31.585 --> 30:34.555
Get going.
Don't miss your flight.

30:38.860 --> 30:39.859
We love you.

30:39.861 --> 30:43.031
- Love you too.
- We'll see you soon. Bye, Dad.

30:56.511 --> 30:58.345
<i>Hi,
everyone, you've reached the Founds.</i>

30:58.347 --> 31:00.514
<i>Please leave a message after the
beep for Ernie, Ellyn and...</i>

31:00.516 --> 31:01.781
<i>And Liner Dog!</i>

31:01.783 --> 31:03.616
<i>Oh, and Liner Dog.</i>

31:05.186 --> 31:08.754
<i>Hey, Ernie. Just wanted
to check up on you, buddy.</i>

31:08.756 --> 31:11.057
I know I said to take
as much time as you need,

31:11.059 --> 31:15.994
but nothing soothes the soul
like medical paperwork, right?

31:15.996 --> 31:18.730
<i>And God bless her. She lived
more life in her 17 years,</i>

31:18.732 --> 31:20.899
<i>than most do in a lifetime.</i>

31:20.901 --> 31:23.235
What I'm trying to say is
I'm here for you buddy, okay?

31:23.237 --> 31:27.039
So, if you need me to pick you up
some food or you just want to talk,

31:27.041 --> 31:29.075
<i>or you need some
company at church,</i>

31:29.077 --> 31:30.709
<i>just give me a call,
and I'll be there for you...</i>

31:30.711 --> 31:32.311
Well, I'm not sure
church is exactly

31:32.313 --> 31:33.678
<i>where I want to be right now.</i>

31:33.680 --> 31:36.184
God hasn't exactly shown
up for me lately.

31:50.998 --> 31:53.065
<i>Hi,
everyone, you've reached the Founds.</i>

31:53.067 --> 31:54.599
<i>Please leave a message
after the beep</i>

31:54.601 --> 31:55.668
<i>for Ernie, Ellyn and...</i>

31:55.670 --> 31:56.836
<i>And Liner Dog!</i>

31:56.838 --> 31:59.105
<i>Oh, and Liner Dog.</i>

32:03.077 --> 32:04.009
Dr. Found,

32:04.011 --> 32:05.743
- I have something...
- Seventeen years,

32:05.745 --> 32:07.781
sweetheart, you've never
called me that.

32:08.882 --> 32:11.117
Not letting you start now.

32:11.119 --> 32:13.921
Sit down, I'll make you
a cup of tea.

32:23.931 --> 32:26.065
Did you get into that
science lab you wanted?

32:26.067 --> 32:27.632
I think, I remember Caroline
saying...

32:27.634 --> 32:30.336
I knew that Line had the moped.

32:30.338 --> 32:34.175
And, I knew she was taking it
to the hospital.

32:36.310 --> 32:37.611
If I'd told you...

32:37.613 --> 32:38.813
"If."

32:46.587 --> 32:48.322
You wanna hear
my list of ifs?

32:50.191 --> 32:53.825
If I could've gotten
the stereo to work,

32:53.827 --> 32:56.761
Line's battery wouldn't
have died,

32:56.763 --> 32:58.966
and maybe she'd have driven
her car.

33:00.101 --> 33:04.069
If I'd brought her
to visit Ellyn that day,

33:04.071 --> 33:08.374
maybe she'd have just
gone to bed after the party.

33:08.376 --> 33:14.015
If I hadn't taken
such a hard line on mopeds,

33:15.715 --> 33:19.220
I could've at least made sure
she wore a helmet.

33:20.488 --> 33:21.688
So...

33:24.892 --> 33:26.928
There's no end to the ifs.

33:28.896 --> 33:31.365
What are we gonna do, Ernie?

33:36.404 --> 33:38.537
All the handouts
say to channel

33:38.539 --> 33:41.075
your anger and guilt
into something.

33:42.610 --> 33:44.278
This is all I've found.

33:46.013 --> 33:48.317
Maybe you can find
something better.

33:51.252 --> 33:55.888
The Trojans football team won
last night 24 to 17,

33:55.890 --> 34:01.660
<i>and last night's volleyball game
against City High was another loss,</i>

34:01.662 --> 34:03.197
<i>due to forfeit.</i>

34:13.873 --> 34:15.975
Good morning, everybody.

34:15.976 --> 34:20.748
<i>I just wanted to say that
that last announcement,</i>

34:21.849 --> 34:23.317
<i>well, it sucked.</i>

34:27.420 --> 34:29.989
Line would've hated it.

34:29.991 --> 34:33.327
<i>Giving up a game without
a fight, and to City...</i>

34:34.996 --> 34:38.130
<i>The thought of playing
volleyball again</i>

34:38.132 --> 34:41.601
<i>makes me almost physically ill,</i>

34:41.603 --> 34:44.772
<i>but I'm gonna do it.</i>

34:46.641 --> 34:48.274
I'm gonna go to practice today

34:48.275 --> 34:53.344
<i>because it's what Line
would have wanted me to do.</i>

34:53.347 --> 34:56.315
<i>And I hope the rest
of the team joins me today too,</i>

34:56.317 --> 34:58.318
<i>because the thing is,</i>

34:58.320 --> 35:00.919
I don't want Line
to ever hear again

35:00.921 --> 35:03.324
that we lost a game
for not showing up.

35:17.038 --> 35:18.737
Well, physically
they're all here.

35:18.739 --> 35:20.572
Mentally, I'd say
they're at 10%.

35:20.574 --> 35:23.809
Certainly don't think they're
ready for a game on Saturday.

35:23.811 --> 35:26.211
All right, everybody,
huddle up.

35:26.213 --> 35:28.349
Let's go, let's go. Huddle up.

35:30.885 --> 35:33.519
I know being here is tough.

35:33.521 --> 35:37.358
But believe me, you're gonna be glad
you have something else to focus on...

35:44.332 --> 35:45.998
We're all hurting.

35:46.000 --> 35:47.701
But here, you can
take that hurt

35:47.703 --> 35:49.968
and apply it to the game
you love to play.

35:49.970 --> 35:53.038
What do you say? No time
like right now. Here we go.

35:53.040 --> 35:55.176
Okay, guys, defensive box drill.
Let's go.

36:12.194 --> 36:14.093
Can't do the drill
without a setter, Coach.

36:14.095 --> 36:16.796
Okay, new plan.
Pepper drill.

36:16.798 --> 36:18.665
Twenty consecutive hits.
Here we go.

36:25.005 --> 36:26.574
Nice. Let's hear you count it.

36:35.751 --> 36:37.285
Is anybody gonna get that?

36:43.224 --> 36:46.760
I don't know if we can do this,
Coach. Just being here...

36:46.762 --> 36:49.194
That's enough!

36:49.196 --> 36:52.564
You all know Caroline Found
never cried on this court.

36:52.566 --> 36:55.534
And neither will any of you.
Anybody's upset?

36:55.536 --> 36:58.273
They need to cry? They can do it
outside the lines.

37:16.357 --> 37:17.391
We'll get there.

37:21.429 --> 37:24.264
- Ugly face contest!
- No fair, you always win.

37:24.266 --> 37:27.067
On three. One, two, three.

37:31.138 --> 37:33.005
<i>Princess, beauty queen.</i>

37:34.975 --> 37:37.844
<i>Samurai skills.</i>

37:37.846 --> 37:39.913
Are you going to practice
tomorrow?

37:39.915 --> 37:42.347
I don't even know if there's
gonna be one.

37:42.349 --> 37:46.219
Brez thinks that people are
looking to me

37:46.221 --> 37:47.622
to keep the team going.

37:48.857 --> 37:50.490
Well, what do you think?

37:50.492 --> 37:53.662
I think that Line could do it
if it was her,

37:55.262 --> 37:57.329
but I'm not as strong as her.

37:57.331 --> 38:00.700
Line brought out your inner
strength. She really did.

38:00.702 --> 38:02.634
But, remember,

38:02.636 --> 38:06.140
you can't bring out something
that isn't already there.

38:12.046 --> 38:14.247
The last thing
that Line said to me

38:14.249 --> 38:17.151
was that this was
gonna be our year.

38:18.219 --> 38:19.719
She was gonna play hard,

38:19.721 --> 38:23.690
and she was gonna dedicate
every single game to her mom.

38:23.692 --> 38:27.493
And I know that our odds
aren't good without Liner,

38:27.495 --> 38:31.830
but even if we could win just
one game,

38:31.832 --> 38:33.200
shouldn't we try?

38:36.271 --> 38:39.239
Does that sound good
to you guys?

38:39.241 --> 38:41.908
We can talk all
day about what we want,

38:41.910 --> 38:43.275
but the only way to
make that happen

38:43.277 --> 38:45.547
is to bust our butts in here.

38:46.581 --> 38:50.449
First thing we gotta do
is find us a new setter.

38:50.451 --> 38:53.018
Usually takes three to five
years to groom a new setter.

38:53.020 --> 38:54.720
We don't have that kind
of time, now, do we?

38:54.722 --> 38:56.121
No, Coach.

38:56.123 --> 38:57.992
All right, let's work.

38:57.994 --> 38:59.659
Scotty, they're all yours.

38:59.661 --> 39:01.263
Okay, line up!

39:03.932 --> 39:05.999
Setting is about precision.

39:06.001 --> 39:07.332
Doesn't matter how good
your hitters are

39:07.334 --> 39:08.935
unless the setter
can get them the ball

39:08.937 --> 39:10.337
exactly where they need it.

39:11.673 --> 39:12.674
Nice.

39:16.110 --> 39:18.343
So, losing every game
of the season.

39:18.345 --> 39:22.048
Is that good or bad
for an assistant coach's career?

39:22.050 --> 39:23.485
All right, Mack. You're up.

39:28.423 --> 39:30.525
Nice job. Brie, you're up.

39:33.795 --> 39:35.195
She's not even looking.

39:36.230 --> 39:38.497
Doesn't have to.
She can hear it.

39:38.499 --> 39:40.769
The less sound you make,
the better your hands are.

39:41.870 --> 39:43.370
Nice job, Brie.

39:43.972 --> 39:45.772
Come on, Kelley, step in.

39:45.774 --> 39:46.775
You got this.

40:10.565 --> 40:13.032
You're gonna touch the ball
every play.

40:13.034 --> 40:15.001
Control who gets it. When.

40:15.003 --> 40:18.004
Where. How.

40:18.006 --> 40:20.607
You gotta feel out your hitters.
Who's hot?

40:20.609 --> 40:22.008
Who's cold?

40:22.010 --> 40:24.242
Tell them, talk to them.

40:24.244 --> 40:26.881
Lead. Offense.

40:27.782 --> 40:28.781
Defense.

40:28.783 --> 40:31.452
Everything on that court
runs through you.

40:33.520 --> 40:35.254
You all right?

40:35.256 --> 40:38.426
- Compared to what?
- These are all the plays

40:39.361 --> 40:40.994
the setter has to know.

40:40.996 --> 40:42.762
I know our plays, you guys.

40:42.764 --> 40:45.431
You know the plays that you ran
and from the receiving side.

40:45.433 --> 40:47.567
Now you need to know which plays
need to be set higher,

40:47.569 --> 40:50.571
- or faster or with softer hands.
- Study up.

40:51.106 --> 40:52.306
Good luck.

40:54.475 --> 40:57.409
See, focus is the hardest
part for me.

40:57.411 --> 40:59.646
I go to class,
but it's like all I hear

40:59.648 --> 41:02.915
is that Charlie Brown
teacher going...

41:02.917 --> 41:05.654
"Wah, wah, wah, wah."

41:06.354 --> 41:07.820
You know, if it helps,

41:07.822 --> 41:10.890
I am actually a pretty good
Charlie Brown teacher translator.

41:10.892 --> 41:14.192
What you just said, just so you
know, was The Gettysburg Address.

41:15.462 --> 41:16.663
Uh...

41:16.665 --> 41:18.064
I just...

41:18.066 --> 41:21.435
I never thought that my senior
year would be like this, you know?

41:22.671 --> 41:23.672
Yeah.

41:25.306 --> 41:27.674
You know, I only met her once.

41:27.676 --> 41:29.709
But she seemed like
a great person.

41:29.711 --> 41:31.579
Line was the best.

41:32.047 --> 41:34.212
The best.

41:34.214 --> 41:37.315
I really wanna win
this first game back for her.

41:37.317 --> 41:39.788
Win or lose,
you're making her proud.

41:40.487 --> 41:41.488
I know it.

41:50.032 --> 41:52.365
<i>The women of
Troy volleyball team</i>

41:52.367 --> 41:54.834
<i>head to Cedar Rapids today
for their first game</i>

41:54.836 --> 41:58.336
<i>since losing their star player,
Caroline Found.</i>

41:58.338 --> 42:01.140
<i>We at WKCR
and everyone in Iowa City</i>

42:01.142 --> 42:02.677
<i>wish them the
best of luck.</i>

42:59.601 --> 43:00.566
Captains.

43:00.568 --> 43:02.637
Seniors, you're our captains.
Let's go.

43:06.007 --> 43:07.642
Ladies, heads or tails?

43:08.510 --> 43:09.511
Heads.

43:11.846 --> 43:13.345
It's tails.

43:13.347 --> 43:15.248
Would you like side,
serve or receive?

43:15.250 --> 43:16.649
Serve.

43:16.651 --> 43:18.818
It's all right, ladies.
Here we go.

43:18.820 --> 43:21.689
Bring it in, everybody.
Everybody, bring it in.

43:22.858 --> 43:25.827
I want you to focus
on playing volleyball.

43:26.694 --> 43:29.395
Nothing else, just volleyball.

43:29.397 --> 43:31.231
- You got it?
- Got it.

43:31.233 --> 43:32.600
Okay, Lizzy B.

43:35.870 --> 43:36.871
Okay.

43:38.706 --> 43:39.841
West on...

43:41.242 --> 43:42.574
Nine.

43:42.576 --> 43:43.810
For Line.

43:43.812 --> 43:45.946
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight, nine.

43:45.948 --> 43:48.550
- West!
- Here we go! You got it, ladies.

44:06.333 --> 44:08.234
No, it's okay. Get up.

44:08.236 --> 44:10.469
You got this, Kelley,
this is what you do.

44:10.471 --> 44:11.939
Good D. Good D.

44:19.447 --> 44:20.713
Watch the ball!
Watch the ball!

44:20.715 --> 44:22.782
Watch your hitters, ladies.
Watch your hitters.

44:22.784 --> 44:24.018
Yeah, watch the middle.
Watch the middle!

44:26.386 --> 44:28.688
And, Montgomery
with a solid side out,

44:28.690 --> 44:30.357
to put the Rams up by two.

44:36.031 --> 44:37.032
Yes!

44:42.804 --> 44:46.405
<i>Oh, my, looks
like some miscommunication.</i>

44:46.407 --> 44:48.007
The girls need
to get this together.

44:48.009 --> 44:50.111
<i>This game is slipping away
from them.</i>

44:56.951 --> 44:59.552
<i>Fliehler seems to
be having a tough time today</i>

44:59.554 --> 45:01.756
<i>finding her teammates for
solid sets.</i>

45:04.159 --> 45:06.093
She's falling apart out there.

45:06.095 --> 45:07.593
We don't have anybody else.

45:07.595 --> 45:10.131
Get your feet there, Kelley.
Get your feet there.

45:40.695 --> 45:42.662
<i>And that's the
game, ladies and gentlemen.</i>

45:42.664 --> 45:45.399
A win for Montgomery
in three straight sets.

45:45.401 --> 45:47.500
<i>And a heartbreaker for
the women of Troy,</i>

45:47.502 --> 45:52.507
<i>who just couldn't get much going today
without their star, Caroline Found.</i>

46:01.516 --> 46:04.717
<i>It's just frustrating.
We're being set up to fail.</i>

46:04.719 --> 46:06.285
- Literally.
- Give her a break, okay?

46:06.287 --> 46:07.620
It's not like she wants
to be awful.

46:07.622 --> 46:09.690
Yeah, but we're the ones
who look bad.

46:09.692 --> 46:11.358
She sets it like four feet
beyond the antennae.

46:11.360 --> 46:15.128
It's like, if we can't save it,
it looks like it's our fault.

46:15.130 --> 46:18.265
And not to be mean, but why is
Kelley one of our co-captains?

46:18.267 --> 46:21.067
If not for Line, I don't think
she'd even be a starter.

46:21.069 --> 46:22.902
Yeah, probably not.

46:22.904 --> 46:24.837
So, what, you wanna tell her
she's not good enough

46:24.839 --> 46:26.639
to stand up there
with the rest of us?

46:26.641 --> 46:29.210
Just sucks, that's all.

46:30.611 --> 46:33.248
It's not how to honor Line,
I know that.

46:45.327 --> 46:47.562
- Ernie?
- Brez.

46:48.196 --> 46:49.095
Hello.

46:49.097 --> 46:51.866
- Wonderful to see you.
- Hello, hello!

46:54.369 --> 46:56.202
That looks good.

46:56.204 --> 46:57.572
Bought it at Target.

46:59.141 --> 47:00.242
- May I?
- Thanks.

47:07.216 --> 47:08.348
You want more champagne?

47:08.350 --> 47:10.618
Don't ask. I'll just take it.

47:11.786 --> 47:14.055
The hardest part for me,

47:16.257 --> 47:18.059
is getting used to the quiet.

47:19.727 --> 47:23.629
Liner was a sworn enemy
of pauses in conversation.

47:23.631 --> 47:25.499
You're not kidding.

47:25.501 --> 47:28.468
She was fearless, wasn't she?

47:28.470 --> 47:29.904
In everything she did.

47:30.805 --> 47:33.541
She just dove right in,
head first.

47:34.642 --> 47:35.843
Took it on.

47:39.481 --> 47:40.882
Without thinking.

47:44.652 --> 47:47.154
Homecoming game's coming
up soon, Ernie.

47:47.156 --> 47:50.556
I think it would mean a lot to
the girls if you were there.

47:50.558 --> 47:51.992
If you can handle it.

47:51.994 --> 47:54.094
Not to say there's
anything wrong

47:54.096 --> 47:56.831
- if you can't...
- It's okay. I know what you mean.

47:58.866 --> 47:59.867
Okay.

48:02.703 --> 48:04.538
It's good to see you, Ernie.

48:04.540 --> 48:05.840
How's the team looking?

48:07.408 --> 48:08.474
The truth?

48:08.476 --> 48:09.711
Please?

48:10.512 --> 48:11.880
It ain't last year.

48:14.149 --> 48:15.949
How many games you got left?

48:15.951 --> 48:17.150
Fifteen.

48:17.152 --> 48:19.352
How many wins do you have
to have to qualify for State?

48:19.354 --> 48:21.321
Fifteen.

48:21.323 --> 48:23.123
What do you think my
daughter would say to us

48:23.125 --> 48:24.659
if she were sitting
at this table?

48:26.395 --> 48:27.929
"Only 15?"

48:29.831 --> 48:30.832
Hmm.

48:34.436 --> 48:36.138
- Down.
- Nice!

48:39.575 --> 48:41.843
Pretty intense
practice schedule, huh?

48:45.214 --> 48:47.214
Okay. Good talk.

48:47.216 --> 48:48.217
Bring it in!

48:51.587 --> 48:54.353
You are defending
state champions.

48:54.355 --> 48:57.858
Every team out there
is hungry to eat you alive.

48:57.860 --> 48:59.960
Do you think when we travel to
Cedar Falls

48:59.962 --> 49:01.394
that they're gonna
take it easy on you

49:01.396 --> 49:02.898
'cause they see how
upset you are?

49:03.365 --> 49:04.732
No, Coach.

49:06.101 --> 49:10.604
Mack, serve to zone one
and practice is over.

49:10.606 --> 49:13.540
If you miss, we run ladders.

49:17.178 --> 49:18.378
Let's go.

49:18.380 --> 49:19.845
Jump serve.

49:19.847 --> 49:23.016
- Really?
- You lead our team in ace serves.

49:23.018 --> 49:24.987
You should be able
to do this blindfolded.

49:35.531 --> 49:36.729
Okay, line up.

49:44.438 --> 49:45.707
Don't be last.

49:49.344 --> 49:50.443
Brie.

49:50.445 --> 49:52.312
Zone one, or two ladders.

49:52.314 --> 49:55.115
Server needs to be able
to put the ball on the court

49:55.117 --> 49:57.152
exactly where the coach
tells them to.

50:11.333 --> 50:15.470
Lizzy B, serve the ball
to zone one or five ladders.

50:17.805 --> 50:19.705
You think this is pressure?

50:19.707 --> 50:20.906
How are you gonna
win our next game

50:20.908 --> 50:23.176
if you can't
even handle practice?

50:38.594 --> 50:41.161
Serve the ball to zone one,

50:41.163 --> 50:42.297
and we're done.

50:42.730 --> 50:43.999
If you miss,

50:44.666 --> 50:46.099
15 ladders for everyone.

50:48.503 --> 50:49.504
Understood?

50:56.612 --> 50:59.081
Come on, Kelley,
you got this.

51:31.346 --> 51:32.612
High and to the outside.

51:32.614 --> 51:35.415
Good. Number 31?

51:35.417 --> 51:37.484
Low set, middle blocker.

51:37.486 --> 51:38.487
Perfect.

51:39.588 --> 51:40.953
Now,

51:40.955 --> 51:43.255
- let's test those reflexes.
- Oh, come on.

51:43.257 --> 51:44.658
You're so weird.

51:44.660 --> 51:46.259
This is an important part
of your training.

51:46.261 --> 51:47.262
Come...

51:52.501 --> 51:54.536
Okay, gotta get back to work.

51:55.803 --> 51:57.337
- Volleyball?
- Mm-hmm.

51:57.339 --> 51:58.340
All right.

51:59.441 --> 52:01.374
- Ready?
- Mmm-hmm.

52:01.376 --> 52:07.012
The trick is to keep it close to
the embers and not the flames.

52:07.014 --> 52:09.318
That way it doesn't catch fire.

52:10.520 --> 52:12.020
I have to tell you something.

52:15.290 --> 52:16.691
I didn't want it.

52:16.693 --> 52:19.659
And if you want me
to step down, I will.

52:19.661 --> 52:22.962
But, Brez made me setter.

52:22.964 --> 52:24.999
And you're doing
a fine job of it.

52:27.968 --> 52:30.570
When I didn't see you
at the games,

52:30.572 --> 52:32.906
I thought that you were

52:32.908 --> 52:36.009
maybe mad that I'm, like,

52:36.011 --> 52:38.144
I don't know,
taking her spot.

52:38.146 --> 52:40.916
You didn't take her spot.
You couldn't do that.

52:42.951 --> 52:45.287
You took a position,
and you're making it your own.

52:48.657 --> 52:50.192
And I'm right behind you.

52:50.958 --> 52:52.361
Hundred percent.

52:53.695 --> 52:56.865
And I may be the surgeon,
but you're the healer out there.

53:47.182 --> 53:50.718
Why am I more nervous for this
than the first game we played?

53:50.720 --> 53:53.386
Because winning homecoming
is a matter of school honor.

53:53.388 --> 53:57.924
It's just another game
with fanfare and huge visibility

53:57.926 --> 54:01.094
and every boy you ever
wanted to date watching.

54:01.096 --> 54:02.462
It's still a game, ladies.

54:02.464 --> 54:04.864
We're gonna show up and play.
Let's go!

54:04.866 --> 54:06.299
Game time, ladies.

54:06.301 --> 54:07.434
Yeah!

54:07.436 --> 54:10.604
<i>And here they come!</i>

54:10.606 --> 54:14.040
Your reigning champions!

54:14.042 --> 54:17.045
<i>The women of Troy!</i>

54:20.783 --> 54:24.050
<i>Number 18, Lizzy Ackerman.</i>

54:24.052 --> 54:26.987
<i>Number 19, Kelley Fliehler.</i>

54:27.988 --> 54:30.559
<i>Number 11, Mackenzie Davidson.</i>

54:32.059 --> 54:34.597
<i>Number eight, Brie Tipton.</i>

54:35.665 --> 54:38.866
<i>Number four, Jessica Bailey.</i>

54:38.868 --> 54:42.068
<i>Number 14, Taylor Mitchell.</i>

54:42.070 --> 54:44.805
<i>Number one, Rebecca Mastry.</i>

55:24.212 --> 55:25.414
High! High!

55:26.516 --> 55:28.049
Free, free, free, free!

55:42.330 --> 55:44.999
- Now, that's some volleyball!
- Thank God!

55:45.001 --> 55:48.268
We are one ball away.
Let's run 82.

55:48.270 --> 55:49.904
Their defense is weak
on that side.

55:49.906 --> 55:51.672
One ball away.

55:51.674 --> 55:53.072
West on nine.

55:53.074 --> 55:56.042
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, West!

55:56.044 --> 55:57.245
We got this.

56:10.893 --> 56:12.693
Watch it. Watch it.

56:12.695 --> 56:13.696
Go on, Brie!

56:23.873 --> 56:25.473
Taylor, you gotta see that.

56:27.242 --> 56:29.008
Okay, that's all right.
Good pass.

56:29.010 --> 56:30.109
Okay, we got this.

56:30.111 --> 56:31.277
- Next one. Come on.
- Yeah.

56:31.279 --> 56:33.614
- Let's go.
- It's all right. It was my fault.

56:33.616 --> 56:34.648
No, it wasn't.

56:34.650 --> 56:37.818
Tay, you gotta hit around
that next time. Okay?

56:37.820 --> 56:39.853
Go, ladies! You got this!

56:39.855 --> 56:42.725
One side out, ladies.
This ends now.

56:44.927 --> 56:46.862
One last play, you guys.

57:15.091 --> 57:16.291
Guys.

57:22.531 --> 57:23.532
Come here.

57:31.239 --> 57:33.741
- Hello?
- Pull out the season schedule.

57:33.743 --> 57:36.645
- Good morning to you, too.
- I'll wait while you get it.

57:38.246 --> 57:41.214
- Okay. Got it.
- Tell me what you see.

57:41.216 --> 57:42.682
Oh, I know there's typos,

57:42.684 --> 57:44.484
but it's not like we're
the English department.

57:44.486 --> 57:47.153
What's the caliber
of the next team we're facing?

57:47.155 --> 57:48.589
They're on the weaker side.

57:48.591 --> 57:51.792
And the next one, and the one
after that?

57:51.794 --> 57:52.795
<i>Weak.</i>

57:54.997 --> 57:56.732
I like where you're
going with this.

58:09.111 --> 58:10.611
Our next five games

58:10.613 --> 58:13.414
are against the weakest teams
in the division.

58:13.416 --> 58:15.382
As long as we keep
our emotions in check,

58:15.384 --> 58:17.051
we'll take them out
without much trouble.

58:17.053 --> 58:18.484
And with momentum
and that confidence,

58:18.486 --> 58:20.921
the next half dozen ones
are very doable, too.

58:20.923 --> 58:23.423
Which means,
if we run the board,

58:23.425 --> 58:25.760
we got a shot at State.

58:26.828 --> 58:28.494
You mean, to win?

58:30.166 --> 58:31.666
I mean, to win.

58:32.902 --> 58:34.203
We could win.

58:34.570 --> 58:35.638
For Line.

58:36.305 --> 58:37.673
For Caroline.

58:38.641 --> 58:40.874
Yeah, but wait,
how many is the board?

58:40.876 --> 58:43.445
- Fourteen.
- You serious?

58:48.349 --> 58:50.351
Yeah, I'm serious.

58:54.389 --> 58:56.389
<i>So, hey, I was thinking,</i>

58:56.391 --> 58:58.459
since you pick
who gets each ball,

58:58.461 --> 59:01.261
if it's a clutch play,
maybe go to someone else.

59:01.263 --> 59:04.230
Usually hitters ask
for more plays.

59:04.232 --> 59:05.666
That's how you get better.

59:05.668 --> 59:06.669
I know.

59:08.938 --> 59:12.072
It's just, I don't want to be
the reason that we don't win,

59:12.074 --> 59:13.173
for Line.

59:15.510 --> 59:17.579
Don't let it be me, okay?

59:22.152 --> 59:23.586
West!

What! Are you kidding me?
Are you blind?

01:00:37.660 --> 01:00:40.661
Come on! It was right here.

01:00:40.663 --> 01:00:42.361
- It was right here!
- Okay. Okay. Okay.

01:00:42.363 --> 01:00:44.264

01:00:48.536 --> 01:00:50.973

And then the improbable
happened.

01:01:16.798 --> 01:01:19.465
The women of West started
winning games.

01:01:19.467 --> 01:01:21.401
One after another.

01:01:21.403 --> 01:01:23.104
And if they win here tonight,

01:01:23.106 --> 01:01:27.474
they'll be headed back to State
next week as quarter-finalists.

01:01:27.476 --> 01:01:31.612
And a chance to honor
their lost captain, Caroline.

01:01:31.614 --> 01:01:33.379
It's a strong team
out there,

01:01:33.381 --> 01:01:35.849
but they are not
as strong as you.

01:01:35.851 --> 01:01:39.920
We keep our heads in the game,
and we can win this.

01:01:39.922 --> 01:01:41.355
For Line.

01:01:41.357 --> 01:01:43.892
- West on two. One, two.
- West!

01:01:45.262 --> 01:01:46.695
Let's go, ladies!

01:01:49.098 --> 01:01:51.665
<i>West is two
points away from victory</i>

01:01:51.667 --> 01:01:54.136
<i>as Kelley Fliehler
heads back to serve.</i>

01:02:05.613 --> 01:02:07.116
<i>Deep serve by West.</i>

01:02:08.050 --> 01:02:09.685
<i>Set to the outside.</i>

01:02:10.220 --> 01:02:11.618
<i>And that's out.</i>

01:02:11.620 --> 01:02:14.087
- You follow the ball.
- It was our point!

01:02:14.089 --> 01:02:15.489
Next time it might not be.

01:02:15.491 --> 01:02:18.091
You follow the ball
till the end of the play.

01:02:18.093 --> 01:02:19.161
Yes, Coach.

01:02:20.362 --> 01:02:23.196
West is in control
of this game,

01:02:23.198 --> 01:02:27.167
<i>and if they win this set,
they win the match.</i>

01:02:27.169 --> 01:02:28.771
<i>Fliehler with the serve.</i>

01:02:30.672 --> 01:02:32.739
You stay with your hitters.

01:02:32.741 --> 01:02:34.177
<i>White Oak sets middle.</i>

01:02:35.178 --> 01:02:36.743
<i>Nice dig by West.</i>

01:02:36.745 --> 01:02:38.545
<i>Fliehler with the set.</i>

01:02:38.547 --> 01:02:40.883
<i>A huge block by White Oak.</i>

01:02:41.617 --> 01:02:44.753
But West still has
match point.

01:02:48.857 --> 01:02:49.823
Can't keep going
to Mackenzie

01:02:49.825 --> 01:02:51.325
while they're
doubling up on her.

01:02:51.327 --> 01:02:53.060
Don't look at me, the blocker on
my side's like seven feet tall.

01:02:53.062 --> 01:02:54.627
Go to Taylor, they're not
looking at her.

01:02:54.629 --> 01:02:56.463
- Yeah, I think I got this one.
- Element of surprise.

01:02:56.465 --> 01:02:57.497
We can't lose
momentum, Kell.

01:02:57.499 --> 01:02:58.865
Not when we're
one ball from State.

01:02:58.867 --> 01:03:01.336
Okay, go again,
I'll push it further out, okay?

01:03:01.338 --> 01:03:02.970
- Come on, guys, come on.
- Yeah.

01:03:02.972 --> 01:03:05.806
<i>White Oak is just
one point away from tying it up.</i>

01:03:05.808 --> 01:03:08.141
<i>West needs this point to win.</i>

01:03:08.143 --> 01:03:09.343
Swing hard.

01:03:09.345 --> 01:03:10.779
<i>Here's the serve
from White Oak.</i>

01:03:13.548 --> 01:03:14.883
<i>Set by Fliehler.</i>

01:03:17.252 --> 01:03:18.318
Yes!

01:03:19.855 --> 01:03:23.857
<i>They did it! The women of Troy
are heading back to State!</i>

01:03:23.859 --> 01:03:26.361
<i>They made it to the
quarter-finals!</i>

01:03:26.363 --> 01:03:30.163
<i>Unbelievable. A 15-game
win streak.</i>

01:03:30.165 --> 01:03:36.502
<i>Let's hear it for
your West High Trojans!</i>

01:03:39.775 --> 01:03:40.876
Good job.

01:03:42.845 --> 01:03:45.814
So, I was thinking
about last season.

01:03:47.117 --> 01:03:49.417
So weird, foreign.

01:03:49.419 --> 01:03:51.920
I mean, remember
when playing used to be fun?

01:03:54.189 --> 01:03:55.624
Yeah, I do.

01:03:58.127 --> 01:03:59.762
I try not to think about it.

01:04:02.965 --> 01:04:04.131
Nice.

01:04:04.133 --> 01:04:06.933
Hmm, how you feeling, hmm?
You ready to take some names?

01:04:06.935 --> 01:04:09.904
I'm just glad that
we're almost through this.

01:04:09.906 --> 01:04:10.804
Home stretch.

01:04:10.806 --> 01:04:12.806
Well, you've already won.

01:04:12.808 --> 01:04:14.643
- You know that, right?
- Yeah.

01:04:15.211 --> 01:04:16.645
Hug you.

01:04:17.746 --> 01:04:18.747
Okay.

01:04:20.282 --> 01:04:22.115
Uh, Coach...

01:04:22.117 --> 01:04:24.887
Aren't you gonna say
something to the parents?

01:04:26.321 --> 01:04:28.522
Oh. Yeah, sure.

01:04:28.524 --> 01:04:30.190
Good morning, everybody.

01:04:30.192 --> 01:04:32.027
- Good morning, Coach.
- Good morning.

01:04:34.464 --> 01:04:36.865
So, here we are again.

01:04:42.472 --> 01:04:43.672
Thanks.

01:04:44.173 --> 01:04:45.238
What?

01:04:45.240 --> 01:04:46.241
Okay.

01:04:51.180 --> 01:04:52.681
Go get 'em, girls.

01:05:13.268 --> 01:05:14.269
I'm glad you called.

01:05:16.705 --> 01:05:18.738
I think it's time
for me to express

01:05:18.740 --> 01:05:21.978
some long-overdue
thanks.

01:05:24.414 --> 01:05:26.982
I've been so angry.

01:05:29.918 --> 01:05:30.919
I know.

01:05:33.222 --> 01:05:36.825
But to have had the life
that I did with Ellyn...

01:05:41.430 --> 01:05:46.768
and those 17 years
with Caroline...

01:05:50.173 --> 01:05:51.341
I know...

01:05:54.210 --> 01:05:55.744
how blessed I am.

01:06:00.215 --> 01:06:01.850
You are blessed, pal.

01:06:03.819 --> 01:06:06.855
I can't blame Him
for wanting her back.

01:06:09.658 --> 01:06:11.027
She's a keeper.

01:07:12.354 --> 01:07:14.854
<i>Now, this is a team
that was absolutely demolished</i>

01:07:14.856 --> 01:07:16.423
<i>by Montgomery earlier
this season,</i>

01:07:16.425 --> 01:07:19.027
<i>but they're playing like
a whole new squad right now.</i>

01:07:21.064 --> 01:07:22.966
Move to the ball!
Move to the ball!

01:07:25.034 --> 01:07:28.035
- Beautiful. Way to read your hitters!
- Yeah!

01:07:28.037 --> 01:07:30.137
Come on, ladies,
we got this.

01:07:30.139 --> 01:07:32.408
- One more, push one.
- Ladies, come on.

01:07:34.977 --> 01:07:36.178
It's up! It's up!

01:07:39.314 --> 01:07:40.581
Yeah!

01:07:42.017 --> 01:07:43.651
Settle down. Settle down.

01:07:43.653 --> 01:07:45.586
- One more to semis.
- I got this, guys.

01:07:45.588 --> 01:07:46.654
- Okay.
- I got it.

01:07:46.656 --> 01:07:48.155
- Go kill it.
- Okay.

01:07:48.157 --> 01:07:49.390
You got this.

01:07:52.629 --> 01:07:56.499
Senior setter, Kelley Fliehler,
is back to serve for game.

01:08:23.091 --> 01:08:25.859
And West High dominates
this quarter-final match

01:08:25.861 --> 01:08:27.261
to advance to the semis.

01:08:30.165 --> 01:08:31.966
<i>And what a
game we've got here.</i>

01:08:31.968 --> 01:08:35.069
<i>Both teams battling for a spot
in the state finals.</i>

01:08:35.071 --> 01:08:36.404
<i>Both are within easy reach</i>

01:08:36.406 --> 01:08:39.142
<i>of the magic 15 points
to win here in game five.</i>

01:08:43.011 --> 01:08:44.279
Watch your hitters.

01:08:49.719 --> 01:08:51.484
- Good job.
- Come on, guys, we got this.

01:08:51.487 --> 01:08:52.752
This one's ours.

01:08:54.923 --> 01:08:57.894
One good pass, ladies,
one good pass.

01:08:59.162 --> 01:09:01.130
Yeah, it's up. It's up.

01:09:05.768 --> 01:09:07.969
- Yeah!
- Nice.

01:09:09.706 --> 01:09:12.272
Match point, match point,
here we go.

01:09:12.274 --> 01:09:16.211
<i>And West is one point
away from the state finals.</i>

01:09:19.147 --> 01:09:21.517
Good. Push it. Push it.

01:09:24.386 --> 01:09:25.388
Yes!

01:09:26.456 --> 01:09:28.288
And West has won the match!

01:09:28.291 --> 01:09:29.689
Yes!

01:09:37.064 --> 01:09:38.898
<i>Who would've
thought that this team</i>

01:09:38.899 --> 01:09:40.600
<i>would be back
in the state championship</i>

01:09:40.603 --> 01:09:41.868
<i>after the roller-coaster ride</i>

01:09:41.870 --> 01:09:43.372
<i>that they've been
through this season?</i>

01:09:46.442 --> 01:09:47.643
Yes!

01:09:53.316 --> 01:09:55.516
Now, a tough match against
City High is ahead,

01:09:55.518 --> 01:09:59.087
<i>but West High has an awful lot
to celebrate tonight.</i>

01:10:12.668 --> 01:10:15.369
<i>Hey, Ernie, it's me, Kelley.</i>

01:10:15.371 --> 01:10:17.638
<i>I'm just really
missing Line today,</i>

01:10:17.640 --> 01:10:20.643
<i>and I thought I might visit
the barn hideout tonight.</i>

01:10:21.577 --> 01:10:23.310
<i>Let me know if that's okay.</i>

01:10:38.661 --> 01:10:40.361
What do you think?

01:10:40.363 --> 01:10:41.562
Is it this one?

01:10:57.480 --> 01:10:59.947
<i>The barn is always
where I went with Caroline</i>

01:10:59.949 --> 01:11:02.351
<i>when I needed
everything to be okay.</i>

01:11:03.286 --> 01:11:06.320
<i>And right then,
everything wasn't.</i>

01:11:06.322 --> 01:11:09.256
<i>The closer we got to State,
the more scared I was</i>

01:11:09.258 --> 01:11:11.527
<i>that we'd come up short.</i>

01:11:12.261 --> 01:11:14.095
<i>That I'd come up short.</i>

01:11:15.531 --> 01:11:18.666
<i>Winning for Line
was everything,</i>

01:11:18.668 --> 01:11:22.004
<i>so losing for Line...</i>

01:11:23.172 --> 01:11:25.107
<i>It was unthinkable.</i>

01:11:58.774 --> 01:12:00.441
<i>Not "win for Line".</i>

01:12:00.443 --> 01:12:04.547
<i>Not "do it for Line,"
but "live like Line".</i>

01:12:35.578 --> 01:12:38.312
- Hey. Uh...
- Hey.

01:12:38.314 --> 01:12:41.782
I'm sorry for being
totally MIA lately,

01:12:41.784 --> 01:12:44.952
but there's something pretty important
that I have to do right now,

01:12:44.954 --> 01:12:46.987
and I was on my way there.

01:12:46.989 --> 01:12:49.625
And then somehow I was
on my way here.

01:12:50.560 --> 01:12:52.393
And...

01:12:52.395 --> 01:12:56.265
it's because I realized
I wanted you there, too.

01:12:57.400 --> 01:13:00.603
I mean, if you're not
doing anything right now.

01:13:01.939 --> 01:13:04.705
Well, I was pretty busy
sleeping, but...

01:13:04.707 --> 01:13:08.842
Right. Yeah, of course.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

01:13:08.844 --> 01:13:11.747
I don't even... I don't know
what I'm doing here. Okay.

Nope.

Hey, Ernie's having a party

01:14:32.294 --> 01:14:33.962
Yeah, I know.

01:14:33.964 --> 01:14:35.563

Sure you are.

01:14:51.347 --> 01:14:53.349
That's what
this is about tonight.

01:14:53.949 --> 01:14:55.752
You are champions to me.

01:14:56.420 --> 01:14:58.252
I'm proud of you guys.

01:14:58.254 --> 01:15:00.320
Now, will you finish the story?

01:15:00.322 --> 01:15:02.456
The story. Right. Okay.

01:15:02.458 --> 01:15:06.995
So I went to pick
up the pizza,

01:15:06.997 --> 01:15:10.531
and the pizza man behind the
counter, he looks at this shirt,

01:15:10.533 --> 01:15:12.668
and he says, "What's that
shirt, what does that mean?"

01:15:13.636 --> 01:15:14.670
And...

01:15:16.105 --> 01:15:18.672
I said to him, "How much
time have you got?"

01:15:18.674 --> 01:15:22.677
And I told him that
I married a woman,

01:15:22.679 --> 01:15:26.717
who... she knew
how to love, and...

01:15:28.018 --> 01:15:32.486
she could see the good
in... in anyone

01:15:32.488 --> 01:15:35.823
and anything she ever met.

01:15:35.825 --> 01:15:39.962
And she gave that
to our daughter, and...

01:15:41.263 --> 01:15:45.802
Caroline knew
how to... live.

01:15:47.204 --> 01:15:49.472
Maybe a little too much
sometimes.

01:15:50.539 --> 01:15:52.107
Listen,

01:15:52.109 --> 01:15:53.440
you guys, what you've done,

01:15:53.442 --> 01:15:56.276
you've brought this town
together. It's amazing.

01:15:56.278 --> 01:16:00.181
Caroline would be so proud
to be here with you.

01:16:00.183 --> 01:16:05.387
And win or lose,
it doesn't matter.

01:16:07.758 --> 01:16:08.623
To Caroline.

01:16:08.625 --> 01:16:11.159
- Yeah.
- Hear, hear.

01:16:11.161 --> 01:16:13.329

for putting so much pressure
on you guys.

01:17:10.753 --> 01:17:13.489
I don't know how you managed
carrying all that weight.

01:17:14.224 --> 01:17:16.191
How you managed,

01:17:16.193 --> 01:17:21.765

01:17:24.968 --> 01:17:26.568
I...

01:17:26.570 --> 01:17:28.705
I told you to win for Line,

01:17:30.073 --> 01:17:35.011
as if that would somehow make
sense of why she died, or...

01:17:36.712 --> 01:17:39.615
help how much
all of us hurt.

01:17:42.384 --> 01:17:44.454
But now, I think
that we should...

01:17:45.789 --> 01:17:48.458
If we wanna show how much
we miss her, we should...

01:17:50.961 --> 01:17:54.630
just play with joy.

01:17:56.365 --> 01:17:57.566
So...

01:17:59.069 --> 01:18:00.703
can we just do that?

<i>and your returning champs,
the West High Trojans.</i>

01:20:16.506 --> 01:20:18.906
Who's ready to play
some West volleyball?

01:20:18.908 --> 01:20:20.910
- Yeah!
- We're ready, Coach.

01:20:41.464 --> 01:20:43.231
<i>Welcome to the 2011</i>

01:20:43.233 --> 01:20:48.102
Iowa State, girls high school,
volleyball championships.

01:20:53.510 --> 01:20:55.576
Before we begin,

01:20:55.578 --> 01:20:57.513
we'd like to honor a player

01:20:57.515 --> 01:21:00.784
we lost just
a few months ago.

01:21:01.751 --> 01:21:04.952
Someone very special
to this community.

01:21:04.954 --> 01:21:09.159
Here, with that dedication
is Kathy Bresnahan.

01:21:12.495 --> 01:21:14.630
- Is this normal?
- No.

01:21:16.199 --> 01:21:18.000
Hey, volleyball fans!

01:21:24.207 --> 01:21:26.340
From the looks of it,

01:21:26.342 --> 01:21:28.576
a lot of you
had a connection

01:21:28.578 --> 01:21:32.113
with our beloved captain,
number nine,

01:21:32.115 --> 01:21:33.948
Caroline Found.

01:21:33.950 --> 01:21:36.184
We love you, Caroline!

01:21:41.157 --> 01:21:45.095
Which isn't surprising, because
Caroline reached out to everyone.

01:21:46.596 --> 01:21:49.099
Strangers, opponents,

01:21:50.133 --> 01:21:51.234
teachers,

01:21:52.135 --> 01:21:54.836
even lowly Coach.

01:21:54.838 --> 01:21:57.273
To Line, they all meant
the same thing.

01:21:58.875 --> 01:21:59.876
Friend.

01:22:05.348 --> 01:22:07.782
So, today,

01:22:07.784 --> 01:22:10.221
we would like to honor
number nine,

01:22:11.121 --> 01:22:13.489
not by having a moment
of silence,

01:22:13.491 --> 01:22:17.058
but by asking you to do
the same, reach out.

01:22:17.060 --> 01:22:19.861
Introduce yourself
to somebody you don't know.

01:22:22.732 --> 01:22:24.731
- Hi.
- Hi, how are you?

01:22:24.733 --> 01:22:27.036
Coach.
Good to see you.

01:22:31.408 --> 01:22:33.308
Good to see you. You, I know.

01:22:33.310 --> 01:22:35.743
You three are trouble.
I'm glad you're here.

01:22:35.745 --> 01:22:36.946
So are you.

01:22:40.083 --> 01:22:42.450
- Hey.
- Kathy, nice to meet you.

01:22:42.452 --> 01:22:43.784
Good luck, Coach.

01:22:43.786 --> 01:22:45.686
Hi, what's your name?

01:22:45.688 --> 01:22:48.422
Line would have loved this.

01:22:49.492 --> 01:22:51.325
West, I need your Captain.

01:22:51.327 --> 01:22:53.029
Here we go, you guys.

01:22:55.865 --> 01:22:57.899
Let's go, coin toss.

01:22:57.901 --> 01:22:59.434
They asked for our captain.

01:22:59.436 --> 01:23:00.768
Right, that's us.

01:23:00.770 --> 01:23:02.939
No, it's you, Kell.

01:23:03.873 --> 01:23:05.373
No, that's not how
we've been...

01:23:05.375 --> 01:23:07.875
You earned it. Go.

01:23:07.877 --> 01:23:09.611
Go on. Get over there.

01:23:09.613 --> 01:23:10.845
I'm not gonna
lose this toss

01:23:10.847 --> 01:23:12.382
'cause you're dragging
your feet, Captain.

01:23:13.650 --> 01:23:16.718
We did this together.
I want everybody there.

01:23:17.819 --> 01:23:19.156
Then go get them.

01:23:20.391 --> 01:23:21.623
Come on.

01:23:21.625 --> 01:23:23.891
I need my girls.

01:23:23.893 --> 01:23:26.297
- Come on, that means you guys, too.
- Go on, go on!

01:23:29.500 --> 01:23:31.232
West, it's your call.

01:23:31.234 --> 01:23:32.335
Heads.

01:23:35.205 --> 01:23:37.104
- Yes.
- Yeah!

01:23:37.106 --> 01:23:39.640
- Serve, side or receive?
- Serve.

01:23:39.642 --> 01:23:40.875
And what side do you want?

01:23:40.877 --> 01:23:43.047
- This side's good.
- Great. Have fun, girls.

01:23:44.114 --> 01:23:45.214
Ah, Kelley,

01:23:45.216 --> 01:23:47.282
we just wanna say whatever
happens out there today,

01:23:47.284 --> 01:23:49.251
it isn't personal,
it's just the game.

01:23:49.253 --> 01:23:50.319
Right. We were thinking

01:23:50.321 --> 01:23:51.886
Line wouldn't want us
to throw the championship.

01:23:51.888 --> 01:23:53.856
So, in a way
we're honoring her too.

01:23:54.592 --> 01:23:56.457
Thanks for letting me know.

01:23:56.459 --> 01:23:58.328
It'll make our win
even sweeter.

01:24:02.098 --> 01:24:06.434
Nice girls, but it's time
to take them down.

01:24:06.436 --> 01:24:08.370
Yeah!

01:24:08.372 --> 01:24:10.305
- West on nine?
- Mmm-hmm.

01:24:10.307 --> 01:24:13.176
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, West!

01:24:17.280 --> 01:24:18.513
Own the net.

01:24:20.149 --> 01:24:22.185
<i>And West gets us started.</i>

01:24:29.791 --> 01:24:32.795
<i>City takes advantage
and hammers it for the kill.</i>

01:24:34.531 --> 01:24:35.932
Let's go, guys.

01:24:37.334 --> 01:24:38.968
Back hands, ladies.

01:24:50.813 --> 01:24:52.246
<i>Blocked by City.</i>

01:24:52.248 --> 01:24:55.152
<i>There's just no hitting
through City's huge block.</i>

01:25:00.157 --> 01:25:02.125
Good job, guys. Keep it up.
Keep it up.

01:25:04.093 --> 01:25:07.194
City with a dominant start.
West can't get their offense

01:25:07.196 --> 01:25:10.300
<i>going around that massive block
that City is putting up.</i>

01:25:18.541 --> 01:25:20.511
It's okay. It's okay.

01:25:24.148 --> 01:25:25.614
Watch the floor, watch the
floor, okay?

01:25:25.616 --> 01:25:26.949
Change it up, serve to one.

01:25:32.855 --> 01:25:37.425
<i>Another kill by City,
as they close in on set two.</i>

01:25:37.427 --> 01:25:40.294
Forget about it, ladies.
Next play.

01:25:51.941 --> 01:25:55.912
<i>City is on a roll.
They look unstoppable.</i>

01:26:01.551 --> 01:26:02.552
You got this.

01:26:03.252 --> 01:26:04.318
Deep serve.

01:26:04.320 --> 01:26:05.321
You got this.

01:26:07.124 --> 01:26:08.690
Free ball, Carmen, free ball.

01:26:08.692 --> 01:26:09.892
Get it over!

01:26:17.568 --> 01:26:18.667
Great job!

01:26:18.669 --> 01:26:20.602
<i>And West is
down two sets to none.</i>

01:26:20.604 --> 01:26:23.973
And the state championship
is just one set away for City.

01:26:29.912 --> 01:26:31.382
We had a heck of a run.

01:26:32.616 --> 01:26:34.216
We really did.

01:26:34.218 --> 01:26:36.451
Line would've
said it was epic.

01:26:36.453 --> 01:26:39.421
We need more Trojans at the net,
they're killing us there.

01:26:39.423 --> 01:26:42.357
I'll run the sixes closer to the
antenna to throw them off.

01:26:42.359 --> 01:26:44.593
Yeah, good. So, Taylor,
you make that adjustment.

01:26:44.595 --> 01:26:46.227
Let's shut them down.

01:26:46.229 --> 01:26:48.697
What? Freshman, you all right?

01:26:48.699 --> 01:26:51.165
Maybe we should go back
to setting mostly to Mackenzie.

01:26:51.167 --> 01:26:52.633
Maybe that's the only way we
have a shot.

01:26:52.635 --> 01:26:53.734
They've been blocking me, too.

01:26:53.736 --> 01:26:55.704
No, no, no.
Trust your setter.

01:26:55.706 --> 01:26:57.105
She knows what you can handle,

01:26:57.107 --> 01:26:59.476
when you're the right person
at the right time.

01:27:02.846 --> 01:27:06.383
You strong women got us here.

01:27:07.551 --> 01:27:09.216
You did this.

01:27:09.218 --> 01:27:11.622
I have never been prouder
to be a coach.

01:27:13.089 --> 01:27:15.589
I love all of you so much.

01:27:15.591 --> 01:27:16.959
I want you to know that.

01:27:17.994 --> 01:27:20.695
Win this for yourselves.

01:27:20.697 --> 01:27:22.597
- We love you too, Brez.
- Yeah.

01:27:22.599 --> 01:27:25.801
Now, come on, Coach, wipe off
those tears.

01:27:25.803 --> 01:27:27.335
No crying on the court.

01:27:27.337 --> 01:27:29.604
- There is no crying on the court.
- No crying!

01:27:29.606 --> 01:27:31.473
That's my rule,
no crying on the court.

01:27:31.475 --> 01:27:34.443
Come on, you guys,
let's play West volleyball.

01:27:34.445 --> 01:27:35.911
West on nine.

01:27:35.913 --> 01:27:39.013
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, West!

01:27:39.015 --> 01:27:42.450
All right, this is your set.
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

01:27:42.452 --> 01:27:44.352
You got this.

01:27:44.354 --> 01:27:46.121
Let's go.

01:27:46.123 --> 01:27:47.989
<i>And West needs
to get something going here</i>

01:27:47.991 --> 01:27:50.960
<i>if they're going to have a prayer
as we start the third set.</i>

01:27:52.663 --> 01:27:54.629
Starts with a pass, ladies.

01:28:01.070 --> 01:28:02.606
- Freshman, here.
- Outside.

01:28:05.208 --> 01:28:06.876
Yes!

01:28:06.878 --> 01:28:10.180
Way to execute, Freshman.
Very nice.

01:28:27.263 --> 01:28:29.230
<i>Number three
with a kill for the win.</i>

01:28:29.232 --> 01:28:32.069
<i>These West High Trojans
have taken their first set.</i>

01:28:35.239 --> 01:28:36.406
Yeah!

01:28:37.374 --> 01:28:38.607
<i>The question we're all asking</i>

01:28:38.609 --> 01:28:40.909
<i>now is will they be able
to go the distance</i>

01:28:40.911 --> 01:28:42.446
<i>as we start the fourth set?</i>

01:28:59.496 --> 01:29:02.799
<i>And we are neck and neck
here at the end of the fourth set.</i>

01:29:03.700 --> 01:29:04.701
Get on that!

01:29:05.936 --> 01:29:08.803
- Yeah!
- Yes!

01:29:11.775 --> 01:29:15.342
And West is one point away
from taking this to a fifth set.

01:29:15.344 --> 01:29:17.111
All right, guys.
We're back in it.

01:29:17.113 --> 01:29:19.447
- Pass me the ball.
- Yeah, I will, babe.

01:29:19.449 --> 01:29:22.083
Okay. Double time, all right?
Double time!

01:29:22.085 --> 01:29:24.254
Let's finish this, all right?
Let's go!

01:29:30.360 --> 01:29:33.162
Go, West, go!
Go, West, go!

01:29:36.198 --> 01:29:37.400
Back set!

01:29:43.407 --> 01:29:45.674
Yeah, me! Outside!
Outside!

01:29:45.676 --> 01:29:46.677
Yeah!

01:29:48.779 --> 01:29:50.380
<i>Huge kill for 11!</i>

01:29:52.182 --> 01:29:55.050
We are going to a fifth set,
where anything can happen.

01:29:55.052 --> 01:29:57.519
We have set. Okay?
Only 15 more points, guys.

01:29:57.521 --> 01:30:00.156

<i>puts West up by one.</i>

01:31:43.728 --> 01:31:47.129

they have to win by two.

01:31:47.131 --> 01:31:50.632
Hey, hey. Who feels good
for the last play?

01:31:50.634 --> 01:31:52.434
