WEBVTT

00:02.133 --> 00:03.234
(Meredith) WHEN MY MOTHER
LEFT MY FATHER,

00:03.234 --> 00:04.375
SHE DIDN'T TELL HIM
SHE WAS LEAVING

00:04.375 --> 00:06.177
AND TAKING ME WITH HER

00:06.177 --> 00:08.379
UNTIL WE'D LANDED ON
THE OTHER SIDE OF THE COUNTRY.

00:08.379 --> 00:12.243
IN THOSE DAYS, IT WAS CALLED
FAMILY TROUBLES.

00:12.243 --> 00:14.345
TODAY IT'D BE CALLED
KIDNAPPING.

00:14.345 --> 00:16.287
COULD YOU PAGE DR. SHEPHERD
ONE MORE TIME?

00:16.287 --> 00:18.389
I PAGED HIM
TWO MINUTES AGO.

00:18.389 --> 00:21.192
IT'S REALLY VERY IMPORTANT THAT
I SPEAK WITH HIM RIGHT AWAY.

00:21.192 --> 00:23.194
HE'S A BRAIN SURGEON.
EVERYONE LOOKING FOR HIM

00:23.194 --> 00:25.356
THINKS IT'S REALLY
VERY IMPORTANT.
(clicking buttons)

00:25.356 --> 00:27.198
I'LL LET YOU KNOW
WHEN HE CALLS BACK.

00:27.198 --> 00:29.060
(woman speaks indistinctly
over p.a.)

00:29.060 --> 00:31.362
SIR, YOU KNOW HOW I SAID I
WANTED TO DO A GUNTHER TODAY?

00:31.362 --> 00:34.165
I SENT YOU AN E-MAIL WITH
MY NEW SCREENING CRITERIA

00:34.165 --> 00:35.306
FOR MY CLINICAL TRIAL.

00:35.306 --> 00:37.138
DID YOU GET A CHANCE
TO LOOK AT IT?

00:37.138 --> 00:39.240
NOT YET. UH, TORRES HAS
A PATIENT FROM THE SINKHOLE.

00:39.240 --> 00:40.411
SHE WOULD BE PERFECT FOR--

00:40.411 --> 00:43.043
YOU KNOW, I'M INSERTING
AN ISLET CELL DEVICE

00:43.043 --> 00:44.175
THIS AFTERNOON.

00:44.175 --> 00:45.316
I'D LIKE YOU TO BE THERE,
SEE HOW IT WORKS, OKAY?

00:45.316 --> 00:47.118
OH, NO. YOU'RE GONNA DO
A HUNDRED OF 'EM.

00:47.118 --> 00:48.319
CAN I SEE THE NEXT ONE?
TODAY'S JUST NOT A GOOD DAY--

00:48.319 --> 00:50.151
I'D LIKE IT TO HAPPEN TODAY.

00:50.151 --> 00:53.154
NO, SIR. THE FIFTH YEARS
ARE AT EACH OTHER'S THROATS.

00:53.154 --> 00:55.086
AND IT'S AFFECTING THE WORK.

00:55.086 --> 00:56.357
I ALMOST PULLED A SPLEEN OUT OF
A MAN WITH A HOLE IN HIS LUNG.

00:56.357 --> 00:57.428
I NEED YOU IN THIS SURGERY.

00:57.428 --> 00:59.260
I CAN'T HAVE YOU SUPERVISE
A GUNTHER.

00:59.260 --> 01:01.192
TORRES CAN SUPERVISE.
IT'S HER PATIENT.

01:01.192 --> 01:03.334
WHO DOESN'T LOVE
A GUNTHER?

01:03.334 --> 01:04.335
(elevator bell dings)

01:04.335 --> 01:06.197
FINE. DO A GUNTHER.

01:06.197 --> 01:07.298
BUT BE IN MY O.R. BY 4:00.

01:07.298 --> 01:09.200

01:16.207 --> 01:17.408
WELL, WHAT HAPPENED
TO THE CHEST TUBE?

01:17.408 --> 01:20.080
AN INTERN'S DOING IT
'CAUSE IT'S INTERN'S WORK,

HEY.
OH, AND YOU HAVE TO GO.

01:27.458 --> 01:29.460

DR. WEBBER CALLED.

01:36.096 --> 01:37.168
HE'S GONNA
PUT THE THING IN.

01:37.168 --> 01:38.269

UH, 4:00.

01:39.470 --> 01:42.303
WAIT. THEY JUST CALL--
WHY WOULD HE DO THAT?

01:42.303 --> 01:43.374
I DON'T KNOW,
BUT I'M NOT COMPLAINING.

01:43.374 --> 01:45.176
I JUST WANT
THE DAMN THING OVER WITH.

01:45.176 --> 01:47.438
SO I'LL, UH... I'LL CALL YOU

02:18.269 --> 02:20.311
(Miranda) SHE WAS PINNED
UNDER HER CAR,

02:20.311 --> 02:22.413
HER LEG WAS AMPUTATED
IN A PIT OF DIRT,

02:22.413 --> 02:25.346

HEY, HANG ON. WE NEED
TO CHECK YOU OUT FIRST.

02:52.273 --> 02:54.275
DOES SHE KNOW ABOUT

SHE'S UNCONSCIOUS.

02:54.275 --> 02:56.377

03:09.560 --> 03:11.392

PELVIC FRACTURE.

03:11.392 --> 03:13.193
AND A COMMINUTED
FEMUR FRACTURE.

03:13.193 --> 03:14.395
HAS ANYONE FULLY EXAMINED
THE STUMP?

03:14.395 --> 03:16.567
PNEUMOPERICARDIUM

03:21.372 --> 03:22.503

03:38.419 --> 03:39.490
AREN'T WORKING WELL TOGETHER.

03:39.490 --> 03:41.292
IT SEEMS TO HELP.

03:41.292 --> 03:42.553

ONE TIME, THE PATIENT DIED,

03:42.553 --> 03:44.295

AT ALL.

03:44.295 --> 03:46.457
OH. UM, SO WHAT, THEY, UH,
PREP HER AND THEN--

03:46.457 --> 03:48.359
UH, NO, NO, NO. NO ATTENDINGS.
JUST THE BUNNIES.

03:49.530 --> 03:51.432
YES, THE O.R. WHY DOES NO ONE
SEEM TO GET THAT PART?

03:51.432 --> 03:53.434

NOT CHIEF OF SURGERY.

04:13.284 --> 04:14.455
DID SOMEBODY CALL
THE O.R.?

04:14.455 --> 04:16.557
NO, BECAUSE SHE NEEDS A C.T.
TO ASSESS HER CARDIAC INJURIES.

04:16.557 --> 04:18.489
WHAT DID I SAY ABOUT--
NO ONE GIVES A CRAP
WHAT YOU HAVE TO SAY.

04:18.489 --> 04:21.592
(monitor beeping erratically)

04:21.592 --> 04:24.295
STILL WANT TO TAKE HER
TO RADIOLOGY?

04:24.295 --> 04:26.537
MAYBE WAIT IN LINE FOR A LITTLE
WHILE TILL THE MACHINE'S FREE?

04:26.537 --> 04:29.300
IS SOMEBODY GONNA CALL
THE O.R.?
(beeping continues)

04:33.544 --> 04:35.406
LET'S CHECK THE LIVER FIRST.
IT'S THE MOST LIKELY SOURCE.

04:35.406 --> 04:36.507
WHAT? NO.

04:36.507 --> 04:38.379
HEY, YANG. WHERE'S MEREDITH?
I DON'T KNOW.

04:38.379 --> 04:39.610
SHE'S IN CARDIOGENIC SHOCK.
THAT'S OUR MAIN CONCERN.

04:39.610 --> 04:41.412
YANG--
THEY--THEY FIRED HER.

04:41.412 --> 04:43.584
MAYBE SHE'S PUTTING ANTHRAX
IN KAREV'S LOCKER.

04:43.584 --> 04:45.285
B.P.'s TANKING.
WE NEED TO UP HER FLUIDS.

04:45.285 --> 04:46.487
NO. HER PERICARDIUM
IS FILLED WITH AIR AND BLOOD.

04:46.487 --> 04:48.419
DO YOU LISTEN
TO ANYONE ELSE, EVER?
ALL THE TIME. JUST NOT YOU.

04:48.419 --> 04:50.621
OR ME, APPARENTLY.
LOOK, SHE'S NOT ANSWERING
HER PHONE OR HER PAGER.

04:50.621 --> 04:52.563
I HAVEN'T SEEN HER. I WAS IN
THE PIT. SHE'S NOT IN THE PIT.

04:52.563 --> 04:54.425
I WAS IN THE ELEVATOR.
SHE'S NOT IN THE ELEVATOR.

04:54.425 --> 04:55.666
(sighs) PAGE DR. GREY.

04:55.666 --> 04:58.298

SHE DIDN'T ANSWER--

WELL, WE CAN RUSH THE LABS.
IT'LL BE FINE.

05:23.093 --> 05:24.825
WELL, BUT HE COULD COME IN
IN A WEEK.

05:24.825 --> 05:26.857
I MEAN, IT JUST SEEMS A LITTLE
WEIRD TO RACE HIM IN HERE--

05:26.857 --> 05:28.929

IT'LL BE OVER IN AN HOUR.

05:43.113 --> 05:44.975

05:44.975 --> 05:48.348
YOU NEED TO SPEND SOME TIME
WITH THE MICE.

05:48.348 --> 05:51.021
THIS IS WHY I LEFT
MY GUNTHER?

05:51.021 --> 05:53.884
ONCE YOU PUT A COUPLE
OF DEVICES IN MICE,

05:53.884 --> 05:56.126
PUTTING ONE
IN A HUMAN'S A BREEZE--

05:56.126 --> 05:58.028
ALL THAT SPACE.

05:58.028 --> 05:59.390
SIR,

05:59.390 --> 06:01.862
I HAVE A FULL SCHEDULE

06:01.862 --> 06:03.063
THAT I ALREADY
HAD TO TAKE APART

06:03.063 --> 06:04.965
SO I COULD WATCH YOU
PUT THIS THING IN A PERSON

06:04.965 --> 06:06.066
THIS AFTERNOON.

06:06.066 --> 06:07.868
HENRY--ALTMAN'S HUSBAND.

06:07.868 --> 06:09.940
I WOULD LIKE TO KEEP AN EYE
ON THE GUNTHER--

06:09.940 --> 06:11.001
PUT ON A MASK, DR. BAILEY.

06:11.001 --> 06:13.003
EVEN WITH MICE,
YOU NEED A STERILE FIELD.

06:21.081 --> 06:22.983
HE'S SKINNY.

06:22.983 --> 06:25.085
SO IT WON'T BE EASY.

06:25.085 --> 06:28.088
(squeaking continues)

06:28.088 --> 06:30.160
GET YOURSELF SOME GLOVES.

06:30.160 --> 06:32.022
(squeaking continues)

06:32.022 --> 06:34.164
DANNY, YOU HAVE A LITTLE BIT
OF BLOOD IN YOUR BRAIN,

06:34.164 --> 06:35.896
SO I'M GONNA HAVE
ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES

06:35.896 --> 06:36.967
TAKE A LOOK AT YOUR FILMS.

06:36.967 --> 06:38.028
IS IT BAD?

06:38.028 --> 06:39.099
IT'S PROBABLY NOTHING,

06:39.099 --> 06:40.100
BUT I JUST DON'T WANT
TO TAKE ANY CHANCES.

06:40.100 --> 06:41.902
DID SUSANNAH WAKE UP?

06:41.902 --> 06:44.034
THEY'RE STARTING
HER SURGERY NOW.

06:44.034 --> 06:46.977
AND SHE DOES HAVE
SOME INTERNAL BLEEDING

06:46.977 --> 06:48.038
THAT THEY NEED TO REPAIR.

06:48.038 --> 06:49.109
WELL, AND WH-WHEN WILL Y--

06:49.109 --> 06:50.180
WHEN WILL YOU TELL HER
ABOUT HER LEG,

06:50.180 --> 06:51.442
AFTER THE SURGERY?

06:51.442 --> 06:53.113
WE'LL JUST SEE
HOW IT GOES,

06:53.113 --> 06:54.184
ALL RIGHT?

06:54.184 --> 06:56.046
BUT--BUT--I-I--
WILL SHE BE ABLE TO FEEL IT?

06:56.046 --> 06:58.088
I MEAN, WHAT IF--WHAT IF SHE
SEES IT...
DANNY...

06:58.088 --> 06:59.920
AND NOBODY'S TOLD HER?
HER LEG IS NOT THE BIG PROBLEM
RIGHT NOW, OKAY?

06:59.920 --> 07:01.452
SHE JUST NEEDS TO GET THROUGH
THE SURGERY.

07:01.452 --> 07:03.053
BUT SHE HAS...

07:03.053 --> 07:05.055
AN INCREDIBLE TEAM
WORKING ON HER.

07:05.055 --> 07:07.097
REALLY, THEY'RE...
UNBELIEVABLE.

07:07.097 --> 07:08.499
(Cristina) GIVE ME
A 10-BLADE, PLEASE.

07:08.499 --> 07:09.930
DON'T GIVE HER A 10-BLADE.

07:09.930 --> 07:11.031
THE WOMAN JUST HAD
HER LEG HACKED OFF.

07:11.031 --> 07:12.202
SHE DOESN'T NEED
HER CHEST CRACKED OPEN

07:12.202 --> 07:13.934
FOR SOMETHING
WE'RE NOT EVEN SURE SHE HAS.

07:13.934 --> 07:16.066
YEAH, WELL, I'M SURE,
AND IF HER HEART CRAPS OUT,

07:16.066 --> 07:18.068
SHE'S NOT GONNA GIVE
A RAT'S ASS ABOUT HER LEG.
(April) LOOK,

07:18.068 --> 07:20.070
WE KNOW THAT SHE IS BLEEDING
FROM HER PELVIS AND HER ABDOMEN,

07:20.070 --> 07:22.072
WHICH GIVES HER PLENTY OF REASON
TO BE HYPOTENSIVE--

07:22.072 --> 07:24.114
LET'S JUST DO AN X-LAP AND SEE
WHAT WE'RE DEALING WITH.
NO!

07:24.114 --> 07:26.016
KAREV, START THE INCISION.
OH.

07:26.016 --> 07:28.118
W-WHY HIM? JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE
PISSED THAT I'M CHIEF RESIDENT

07:28.118 --> 07:29.480
DOESN'T MEAN THAT YOU CAN
PRETEND I'M NOT HERE.

07:29.480 --> 07:30.951
NOBODY CARES
THAT YOU'RE CHIEF RESIDENT.

07:30.951 --> 07:32.082
CAN EVERYONE JUST SHUT UP,
PLEASE?

07:32.082 --> 07:33.524
WE ARE WASTING TIME ARGUING.

07:33.524 --> 07:35.956
THE ONLY LOGICAL CONCLUSION IS,
TAKE CARE OF THE HEART FIRST.

07:35.956 --> 07:38.088
HEY, IS THE E.R. STILL A ZOO?

07:38.088 --> 07:40.030
(mouth full) NO, THEY GOT
EVERYONE WHO SURVIVED...
(Jackson) YOU PUT IN
THE CHEST TUBE ALREADY.

07:40.030 --> 07:41.461
THE HEART WILL WAIT.
OUT OF THE HOLE A WHILE AGO.

07:41.461 --> 07:43.463
IT'S QUIETED DOWN.
(Cristina) I'M RIGHT.

07:43.463 --> 07:45.065
THE CHANGES WERE SUBTLE
ON THE X-RAY,

07:45.065 --> 07:46.066
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN
THEY DON'T EXIST.

07:46.066 --> 07:47.067
SHE GOT THE CROSSWORD
DOWN THERE?

07:47.067 --> 07:49.139
SUDOKU.
YOU EVER TRY IT?

07:49.139 --> 07:51.001
BORES THE CRAP OUTTA ME.
AMEN.

07:51.001 --> 07:52.072
(April) ...A MAJOR POTENTIAL
SOURCE OF BLEEDING.

07:52.072 --> 07:53.103
(Jackson)
YOU'RE OUTVOTED, YANG.

07:53.103 --> 07:55.075
WHO DO YOU THINK
THE GUNTHER IS?

07:55.075 --> 07:57.147
Cristina) THIS IS NOT
A DEMOCRACY. THIS IS SURGERY.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

07:57.147 --> 07:59.049
IS THIS YOUR FIRST ONE?
(April) YEAH, AND THERE ARE
CERTAIN RULES TO FOLLOW...

07:59.049 --> 08:02.252
HMM. THE NAME GUNTHER COMES FROM
THE DOCTOR, NOT THE PATIENT.

08:02.252 --> 08:04.054
ONE OF THE RESIDENTS
ALWAYS KIND OF EMERGES

08:04.054 --> 08:05.556
AS A LEADER WHEN THEY DO THIS.

08:05.556 --> 08:08.158
AND THE FIRST TIME, IT WAS THIS
LITTLE QUIET GUY NAMED GUNTHER,

08:08.158 --> 08:10.160
AND EVERYONE THOUGHT HE WAS
GONNA FLAME OUT OF THE PROGRAM,

08:10.160 --> 08:12.062
BUT IT TURNS OUT,
HE'S THE ALPHA DOG.
GREAT.

08:12.062 --> 08:13.193
(April) AIRWAY AND BREATHING
ARE TAKEN CARE OF...

08:13.193 --> 08:15.065
WE KNOW IT WON'T BE AVERY.
HE DOESN'T HAVE ANY BALLS.

08:15.065 --> 08:17.067
WELL, KAREV'S GOT THE BALLS,
BUT EVERYONE HATES HIM.

08:17.067 --> 08:18.529
SO I DON'T REALLY SEE THEM
FOLLOWING HIS LEAD.
YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M NOT...

08:18.529 --> 08:20.170
BOUND TO BE YANG.

08:20.170 --> 08:22.502
I DON'T KNOW. KEPNER'S KIND OF
A DARK HORSE THESE DAYS.

08:22.502 --> 08:24.274
(Cristina) ...YOUR ANATOMY
BOOK A GOOD READ,

08:24.274 --> 08:26.577
YOU'LL REALIZE
THAT THE HEART...
YOU FEEL GOOD
ABOUT THAT POSITION?

08:26.577 --> 08:28.278
IT'S THE MAIN PUMP.
HUH?

08:28.278 --> 08:30.240
IT GOES, EVERYTHING GOES.
YOU WILLING TO BACK THAT UP?

08:30.240 --> 08:32.242
(Jackson) TELL US WHAT YOU
THINK IS WRONG WITH HER HEART.

08:32.242 --> 08:34.514
WHAT, LIKE, 50 BUCKS?
(Cristina) FINALLY. I THINK SHE
HAS A TEAR IN HER PERICARDIUM.

08:34.514 --> 08:36.516
(Alex) YOU THINK SHE HAS
A CARDIAC TAMPONADE?
BRING IT.

08:36.516 --> 08:38.048
SHE DOESN'T EVEN HAVE ANY--
(Cristina)
BUT SHE'S HYPOTENSIVE.

08:38.048 --> 08:39.049
(Jackson) WE GOT A PLENTY
OF OTHER REASONS

08:39.049 --> 08:40.150
FOR THE HYPOTENSION.

08:40.150 --> 08:42.152
HOW ARE THEY DOING?

08:42.152 --> 08:44.194
(Arizona) STILL TRYING TO AGREE
WHERE TO START.
(residents
arguing indistinctly)

08:44.194 --> 08:47.558
I JUST HAD TO PUT
AN ISLET CELL DEVICE...

08:47.558 --> 08:49.229
IN A MOUSE.

08:49.229 --> 08:51.301
DO YOU KNOW HOW SMALL
A MOUSE'S OMENTUM IS?

08:51.301 --> 08:54.304
I'M GONNA GO WITH
REALLY SMALL.
(Cristina) ...STRONGLY CONSIDER
A THORACOTOMY.

08:54.304 --> 08:56.306
(monitor beeping erratically)
UP THE DOPAMINE TO 15.

08:56.306 --> 08:57.608
HAPPY NOW.
SHE'S BOTTOMING OUT.

08:57.608 --> 08:59.109
WELL, IF WE'D GET IN THERE
AND PACK THE PELVIS,

08:59.109 --> 09:00.170
THAT ALONE WILL HELP
THE BLOOD PRESSURE, RIGHT?

09:00.170 --> 09:01.211
WELL, YEAH, I HOPE SO

09:01.211 --> 09:02.312
'CAUSE HER SYSTOLIC'S DOWN
TO 68.

09:02.312 --> 09:04.044
BECAUSE HER HEART
IS EXPLODING.

09:04.044 --> 09:06.116
OKAY...
IS THIS WHERE I STEP IN?

09:06.116 --> 09:08.218
(April) WE NEED TO STABILIZE
THE INTERNAL BLEEDING

09:08.218 --> 09:10.180
AND THEN WE CAN GET A T.E.E.
WHILE WE'RE IN THERE--
YANG!

09:10.180 --> 09:11.321
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
OPENING HER CHEST.
WHAT DOES IT LOOK LIKE?

09:11.321 --> 09:13.283
RIB SPREADER.

09:13.283 --> 09:15.125
OH, MY GOD.

09:15.125 --> 09:18.058
♪♪♪

09:18.058 --> 09:21.131
WE'LL HAVE THESE LAB RESULTS
BACK IN A FEW MINUTES,

09:21.131 --> 09:23.293
THEN YOU'LL GET
A HAPPY COCKTAIL,

09:23.293 --> 09:25.165
AND THEY'LL TAKE YOU
UP TO THE O.R.

09:25.165 --> 09:27.567
I MEAN, HIS GLUCOSE LEVELS
AREN'T SPIKING OR ANYTHING?
NO.

09:27.567 --> 09:28.568
I MEAN, NOTHING THAT WOULD
MAKE YOU WANT TO PUSH THIS UP?

09:28.568 --> 09:30.240
NOTHING. WE GOT AN OPENING.

09:30.240 --> 09:31.241
OPENING, RIGHT.
YES.

09:31.241 --> 09:33.103
OKAY.

09:33.103 --> 09:34.204
ARE YOU NERVOUS?

09:34.204 --> 09:36.106
NO.

09:36.106 --> 09:38.108
SHE'S NERVOUS.
IT'S KINDA CUTE.

09:38.108 --> 09:39.149
ALL RIGHT. I'M--

09:39.149 --> 09:41.351
I'M--I'M GONNA GO.

09:41.351 --> 09:45.285
(woman speaking indistinctly
over p.a.)

09:46.657 --> 09:49.159
I LOVE YOU SO MUCH.

09:49.159 --> 09:52.122
(voice breaking)
AND YOU HAVE MADE ME...

09:52.122 --> 09:53.123
SO HAPPY.

09:53.123 --> 09:54.124
I MEAN, LIKE...

09:54.124 --> 09:56.266
LIKE REALLY,

09:56.266 --> 09:57.327
REALLY HAPPY

09:57.327 --> 10:01.231
FOR THE FIRST TIME
IN MY LIFE, I THINK.

10:01.231 --> 10:02.232
(elevator bell dings)

10:02.232 --> 10:03.333
ARE YOU SAYING GOOD-BYE?

10:03.333 --> 10:05.605
NO. NO. NO.

10:05.605 --> 10:07.678
'CAUSE YOU--YOU KEEP TELLING ME,
THIS IS A SIMPLE PROCEDURE.

10:07.678 --> 10:09.209
IT IS. IT IS.

10:09.209 --> 10:10.340
IT--IT'S--IT'LL, UM...

10:10.340 --> 10:12.212
IT'LL--IT'LL--
IT'LL BE FINE.

10:12.212 --> 10:13.383
YEAH, BUT THAT SOUNDED LIKE,

10:13.383 --> 10:16.216
"AND IF I NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN,
REMEMBER I LOVE YOU."

10:16.216 --> 10:19.189
IT DID.

10:19.189 --> 10:21.151
I SHOULD GO.

10:21.151 --> 10:23.153
I THINK
IT'S A GOOD IDEA.

10:23.153 --> 10:24.324
(beeps)
(sighs) IT'S A RIM SUBDURAL.

10:24.324 --> 10:25.696
IT'LL PROBABLY REABSORB.

10:25.696 --> 10:28.158
I'M NOT THAT CONCERNED.
YOU SHOULD KEEP AN EYE ON IT.

10:28.158 --> 10:29.199
GOOD.

10:29.199 --> 10:30.260
(beeping)

10:30.260 --> 10:31.702
EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT?

10:31.702 --> 10:33.704
UH, MEREDITH DISAPPEARED
WITH ZOLA.

10:33.704 --> 10:36.206
WH-WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
SHE DISAPPEARED?

10:36.206 --> 10:37.207
(exhales deeply)

10:37.207 --> 10:39.269
SHE... HAD A ROUGH DAY.

10:39.269 --> 10:40.711
SHE PROBABLY JUST
WENT OUT FOR A WALK.

10:40.711 --> 10:43.343
DEREK, THERE ARE A HUNDRED
POSSIBLE EXPLANATIONS.

10:43.343 --> 10:45.345
DON'T ASSUME THE WORST.

10:45.345 --> 10:46.416
YOU KNOW WHY I DO THAT?

10:46.416 --> 10:47.678
BECAUSE LATELY,

10:47.678 --> 10:49.379
THE LEVEL OF INSANITY
IN MY WIFE'S BEHAVIOR

10:49.379 --> 10:51.421
DEFIES IMAGINATION.

10:51.421 --> 10:53.223
I KNOW, BUT SOMETIMES--
EVEN WITH CRISTINA--

10:53.223 --> 10:55.325
SOMETIMES, THEY SURPRISE US.

10:55.325 --> 10:57.427
(beeps)
(sighs)

10:57.427 --> 10:59.389
(Cristina) GOT SOME BLEEDING
IN THE UPPER RIGHT QUADRANT.

10:59.389 --> 11:02.192
GIVE ME MORE SUCTION
AND LAP PADS.

11:02.192 --> 11:03.433
DO YOU SEE ANY BILE
OR PANCREATIC SECRETIONS?

11:03.433 --> 11:04.735
(Jackson) NONE HERE.
(Alex) NEGATIVE.

11:04.735 --> 11:07.237
HEY, I'M WATCHING
HENRY'S SURGERY TODAY.

11:07.237 --> 11:08.398
(Cristina) WE SHOULD SET UP
FOR AUTOTRANSFUSION.
WHY?

11:08.398 --> 11:12.172
'CAUSE THE CHIEF
LOVES AN AUDIENCE.

11:12.172 --> 11:13.373
NOT BECAUSE HE'S WORRIED
THAT SOMETHING'S WRONG

11:13.373 --> 11:15.205
AND HE--HE WANTS YOU THERE
TO HELP?

11:15.205 --> 11:17.207
I DON'T THINK SO.
(Cristina) WHAT ARE YOU
DOING ABOUT IT?

11:17.207 --> 11:18.709
HAVE HIS ACCU-CHEKS
BEEN BAD?

11:18.709 --> 11:20.380
NO, BUT HE WASN'T
SUPPOSED TO BE IN SURGERY

11:20.380 --> 11:22.212
FOR ANOTHER TWO WEEKS...
(residents speaking
indistinctly)

11:22.212 --> 11:24.214
AND THEN THIS MORNING,
HE CALLS HENRY UP

11:24.214 --> 11:25.455
AND HAS HIM
RACE INTO THE HOSPITAL--

11:25.455 --> 11:27.187
HE'S GETTING BATTY
IN HIS OLD AGE.

11:27.187 --> 11:28.418
OH, WELL, THAT'S GREAT,

11:28.418 --> 11:30.290
'CAUSE HE'S CUTTING OPEN
MY HUSBAND TODAY.

11:30.290 --> 11:32.422
I'LL BE STANDING THERE,
CONTEMPLATING MY MORTALITY.

11:32.422 --> 11:35.395
IF THE BATTY ACTS UP,
I'LL LEND A HAND.

11:35.395 --> 11:36.466
(Cristina)
DID YOU CHECK THE DUODENUM?

11:36.466 --> 11:38.228
SOMETHING IS NOT RIGHT.

11:38.228 --> 11:39.770
YOU CAN DETACH THE OMENTUM
FROM THE ANTERIOR...

11:39.770 --> 11:41.471
YOU KNOW WHAT YOU SOUND LIKE?

11:41.471 --> 11:43.203
TO GET A BETTER LOOK.
(Alex) I'M AWARE OF THAT.

11:43.203 --> 11:44.374
METZ.
A WIFE.

11:44.374 --> 11:46.336
CARDIAC RUPTURE,
LIKE I SAID.

11:46.336 --> 11:47.707
A LOT OF BLEEDING
DOWN HERE.

11:47.707 --> 11:49.209
JACKSON, UH, HELP HER
HOLD PRESSURE THERE.

11:49.209 --> 11:50.410
LAP PADS
DOWN IN THERE, PLEASE.

11:50.410 --> 11:52.382
LOOKS LIKE YANG'S THE GUNTHER.
(Cristina) DID YOU GET IT?

11:52.382 --> 11:54.384
YEP. NO SURPRISE.

11:54.384 --> 11:55.415
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

11:55.415 --> 11:57.317
IT MEANS SHE TOOK OVER
WHILE EVERYONE ELSE

11:57.317 --> 11:59.289
IS STANDING AROUND
LOOKING LIKE IDIOTS

11:59.289 --> 12:00.450
DOING WHATEVER SHE SAYS.

12:00.450 --> 12:01.491
(Jackson) CAN YOU SUTURE IT?

12:01.491 --> 12:03.253
I MEAN, LOOK AT AVERY.
USELESS.

12:03.253 --> 12:05.295
I GOTTA GO. KEPNER.

12:05.295 --> 12:07.397
WHAT WAS I THINKING?

12:07.397 --> 12:08.759
(Alex) MORE LAP PADS
OVER HERE.

12:08.759 --> 12:10.500
OH, NO. NO, NO.
THIS IS THE OPPOSITE...

12:10.500 --> 12:12.763
I NEED A CLAMP IN HERE.
I GOT A BLEEDER.
OF WHAT SHE SHOULD BE DOING.

12:12.763 --> 12:14.304
I'M TRYING TO TEACH HER
SOME HUMILITY,

12:14.304 --> 12:15.735
AND SHE'S RUNNING THE O.R.
ON A MASSIVE TRAUMA.

12:15.735 --> 12:17.237
WHAT CAN YOU DO?

12:17.237 --> 12:19.369
SOME PEOPLE ARE RACEHORSES.
SHE'S A RACEHORSE.

12:19.369 --> 12:20.510
(monitor beeping erratically)
V-FIB.

12:20.510 --> 12:22.472
I NEED THE PADDLES.

12:22.472 --> 12:23.513
(beeping continues)

12:23.513 --> 12:25.345
CHARGE TO 20.

12:25.345 --> 12:26.746
(defibrillator whines)
CLEAR.

12:26.746 --> 12:28.448
(paddles thunk,
defibrillator beeps)

12:28.448 --> 12:30.320
(monitor beeping erratically)
NO CHANGE.

12:30.320 --> 12:32.382
OKAY, I NEED 1
OF INTRACARDIAC EPI.

12:32.382 --> 12:33.784
SOMEONE TAKE OVER
MASSAGING THE HEART.
I GOT IT.

12:33.784 --> 12:35.786
(beeping continues)

12:35.786 --> 12:37.387
OW!
OH, MY GOD.

12:37.387 --> 12:39.529
AH.

12:39.529 --> 12:42.392
OH, MY GOD. OH, MY GOD.
ALEX?

12:42.392 --> 12:43.533
LOOK AT ME.

12:43.533 --> 12:45.265
(beeping continues)

12:45.265 --> 12:46.536
ALEX, LOOK AT ME.
ALEX?

12:46.536 --> 12:48.839
(beeping continues)

12:48.839 --> 12:49.840
OH, MY GOD, ALEX!
WHAT THE--

12:49.840 --> 12:51.301
ALEX!

12:51.301 --> 12:52.502
(beeping continues)

12:52.502 --> 12:54.845
RACEHORSE?
MY BAD.

12:54.845 --> 12:57.347
(Cristina)WHAT THE--
WHAT THE HELL JUST HAPPENED?

13:02.382 --> 13:04.114
(Jackson)
EPI. GIVE ME ANOTHER EPI.

13:04.114 --> 13:05.185
(woman) HERE YOU GO, DOCTOR.
I CAN'T FIND A PULSE.

13:05.185 --> 13:06.186
WHY THE HELL
DOESN'T HE HAVE A PULSE?

13:06.186 --> 13:07.317
I NEED A CRASH CART.

13:07.317 --> 13:08.388
AN EPI DOESN'T STOP
A HEALTHY PERSON'S HEART.

13:08.388 --> 13:10.290
WHAT DID YOU DO?
I DON'T KNOW.

13:10.290 --> 13:12.122
ALL RIGHT. HER HEART'S BACK. I'M
GONNA DEAL WITH THE PERICARDIUM.

13:12.122 --> 13:14.064
FORGET ABOUT THE PELVIS FOR NOW.
SHE'S BLEEDING

13:14.064 --> 13:15.265
THROUGH THE PACKING
IN THE RIGHT UPPER QUADRANT.

13:15.265 --> 13:17.367
SHOULD I REPACK IT?
TRY A PRINGLE MANEUVER.
GRAFT, PLEASE.

13:17.367 --> 13:19.369
HEY, UH, GET ME AND DR. ALTMAN
GOWNED AND GLOVED,

13:19.369 --> 13:21.171
AND I NEED SOMETHING
TO STAND ON.

13:21.171 --> 13:23.073
DR. BAILEY,
IT'S UNDER CONTROL, OKAY?

13:23.073 --> 13:24.304
WE GOT A LOT OF HANDS IN HERE,
AND TWO MORE SURGEONS

13:24.304 --> 13:25.405
ARE ONLY GONNA CONFUSE MATTERS.

13:25.405 --> 13:27.137
I'M GONNA ASK YOU
TO STEP BACK, PLEASE.

13:27.137 --> 13:30.080
CAN I GET ANOTHER PLEDGETED
3-0 PROLENE? SUCTION.

13:30.080 --> 13:31.381
V-FIB.
CHARGING TO 200.

13:31.381 --> 13:32.382
CLEAR.

13:32.382 --> 13:34.084
(groans)

13:34.084 --> 13:35.415
(coughs)
ALEX?

13:35.415 --> 13:38.118
ALEX? ALEX, CAN YOU HEAR ME?
ALEX?

13:38.118 --> 13:39.389
YOU CRAZY BITCH.

13:39.389 --> 13:41.221
YOU ALMOST KILLED ME.

13:41.221 --> 13:43.123
OH. (exhales)

13:43.123 --> 13:44.294
I CALLED HOME.
I SCOURED THE HOSPITAL.

13:44.294 --> 13:47.297
I EVEN HAD AN INTERN
CALL EVERY E.R. IN THE CITY

13:47.297 --> 13:49.299
TO MAKE SURE SHE WASN'T
RUN OVER BY A BUS.

13:49.299 --> 13:51.331
THERE'S NO SIMPLE EXPLANATION.

13:51.331 --> 13:54.134
UH, WHY DON'T YOU LET ME
HANDLE TALKING TO NICKY'S DAD?

13:54.134 --> 13:56.106
I DON'T MIND.
I'M FINE.

13:56.106 --> 13:57.307
(indistinct conversations)

13:57.307 --> 13:59.309
(woman speaking indistinctly
over p.a.)

13:59.309 --> 14:01.111
HOW IS HE?

14:01.111 --> 14:03.173
THERE WERE THREE FRACTURES
IN NICKY'S SPINE.

14:03.173 --> 14:05.115
WE REPAIRED THE DAMAGE.

14:05.115 --> 14:07.147
LOOKS LIKE, NEUROLOGICALLY,
HE'S INTACT.

14:07.147 --> 14:09.179
THIS IS
THE "WAIT AND SEE" PART.

14:09.179 --> 14:10.450
CAN I SEE HIM?

14:10.450 --> 14:12.122
HE'S IN RECOVERY RIGHT NOW.

14:12.122 --> 14:14.184
THEY'RE NOT
GONNA LET YOU SEE HIM.

14:14.184 --> 14:15.285
(sighs)

14:15.285 --> 14:18.288
I CAN'T BELIEVE
THAT THIS IS HAPPENING.

14:18.288 --> 14:20.360
WE WERE JUST
WALKING DOWN THE STREET,

14:20.360 --> 14:24.134
TALKING ABOUT WHY... (chuckles)
PEOPLE DON'T HAVE GILLS.

14:24.134 --> 14:26.136
I WAS HOLDING HIS HAND,

14:26.136 --> 14:28.398
AND HE JUST...

14:28.398 --> 14:30.170
SLIPPED AWAY.

14:30.170 --> 14:32.172
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

14:32.172 --> 14:34.374
HOW DO YOU GO THROUGH THE DAY
WHEN ONE MINUTE TO THE NEXT,

14:34.374 --> 14:37.147
YOUR CHILD COULD JUST...

14:37.147 --> 14:39.279
EXCUSE ME.

14:43.153 --> 14:44.214
I'M SORRY.

14:44.214 --> 14:45.415
HE'S...

14:47.157 --> 14:48.458
LET'S GO FIND NICKY.

14:48.458 --> 14:50.420
I THOUGHT YOU SAID, THEY
WEREN'T GONNA LET ME SEE HIM.

14:50.420 --> 14:52.162
WELL, WE'RE GONNA
FIGURE SOMETHING OUT.

14:52.162 --> 14:53.423
YOU NEED TO SEE YOUR SON.

14:53.423 --> 14:54.424
DON'T TOUCH ME.

14:54.424 --> 14:55.465
I'M NOT TOUCHING YOU.

14:55.465 --> 14:56.526
DON'T TOUCH MY GURNEY!

14:56.526 --> 14:58.398
ALL RIGHT, GET THIS ARTERY.
SEE RIGHT THERE?

14:58.398 --> 14:59.469
YEAH.

14:59.469 --> 15:01.531
GOOD. NOW DO A TIE
ON THE HEMOSTAT.

15:01.531 --> 15:03.273
(Miranda)
WHO'D HAVE THUNK IT?

15:03.273 --> 15:04.474
AVERY'S THE GUNTHER.

15:04.474 --> 15:06.306
WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED?

15:06.306 --> 15:08.208
YANG ALMOST KILLED KAREV,
AND AVERY'S THE GUNTHER.

15:08.208 --> 15:09.509
AVERY?
MM-HMM.

15:09.509 --> 15:11.441
GET OUTTA HERE.
HAND TO GOD.

15:11.441 --> 15:12.482
AVERY...

15:12.482 --> 15:14.414
GOOD JOB, SON.

15:14.414 --> 15:16.386
THANK YOU.

15:16.386 --> 15:18.318
I'M RIGHT HERE
IF YOU NEED ANYTHING.
(pager beeps)

15:18.318 --> 15:19.449
OH, DAMN IT.

15:19.449 --> 15:22.192
MY GUY WON.

15:22.192 --> 15:24.194
(door opens and closes)

15:24.194 --> 15:25.555
WE'RE GONNA BE GREAT TOGETHER.

15:27.327 --> 15:30.330
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

15:32.332 --> 15:34.234
SORRY.

15:34.234 --> 15:36.436
A LITTLE HICCUP
IN THE GUNTHER.

15:36.436 --> 15:38.238
WELL, TAKE YOUR TIME.

15:38.238 --> 15:42.212
YOU KNOW, I'VE SEEN YOU
OPEN AN ABDOMEN BEFORE.

15:42.212 --> 15:44.314
WHEREAS DR. GREY--

15:44.314 --> 15:45.445
I DON'T WANT AN OBSERVER.
I WANT AN ASSIST.

15:45.445 --> 15:46.546
OH, OKAY.
IS SOMETHING WRONG?

15:46.546 --> 15:48.318
NO, THIS IS
A TEACHING HOSPITAL.

15:48.318 --> 15:49.449
AND YOU'RE NOT TOO OLD
TO LEARN.

15:49.449 --> 15:51.551
YEAH, BUT IT'D BE GOOD
EXPERIENCE FOR GREY TO SEE--

15:51.551 --> 15:54.354
DR. BAILEY, IF WANTED
A RESIDENT'S HELP,

15:54.354 --> 15:55.485
I'D ASK FOR IT.

15:57.227 --> 15:58.328
HERE YOU GO, DOCTOR.

15:58.328 --> 16:00.330
THANK YOU.

16:00.330 --> 16:02.432
(clears throat)

16:02.432 --> 16:04.334
WHENEVER YOU'RE READY.

16:04.334 --> 16:05.565
(beeping continues)

16:05.565 --> 16:07.397
ALL RIGHT, THEN GET BACK TO ME
WITH HER POST-OP CRIT.

16:07.397 --> 16:08.538
AND MAKE SURE
YOU'RE AGGRESSIVE

16:08.538 --> 16:10.300
WITH THE DRESSINGS
ON HER LEG.

16:10.300 --> 16:11.441
I'M STILL WORRIED ABOUT
AN INFECTION.

16:11.441 --> 16:12.572
OKAY.

16:12.572 --> 16:14.274
HEY.

16:14.274 --> 16:15.545
YOU KNOW WHY SHE JUST
DID WHAT HE SAID, RIGHT?

16:15.545 --> 16:17.547
BECAUSE HE'S THE GUNTHER.

16:17.547 --> 16:20.250
HOW DID IT GO?

16:20.250 --> 16:22.352
WE'LL HAVE TO GO BACK
FOR DEFINITIVE REPAIRS,

16:22.352 --> 16:23.483
BUT WE STOPPED
THE MAJOR HEMORRHAGING,

16:23.483 --> 16:24.614
GOT THE LEG ALL CLEANED OUT.
GOOD.

16:24.614 --> 16:26.586
NICE WORK TODAY, AVERY.
THANK YOU.

16:26.586 --> 16:28.518
(woman) THANK YOU, DOCTOR.
I JUST HOPE SHE, UH,
PULLS THROUGH.

16:28.518 --> 16:30.420
MM.

16:30.420 --> 16:31.561
HOW'S ALEX?

16:31.561 --> 16:33.493
(people speaking indistinctly)

16:33.493 --> 16:34.624
HE SHOULD BE FINE.

16:34.624 --> 16:36.626
APPARENTLY, HE HAD
AN UNDERLYING ARRHYTHMIA,

16:36.626 --> 16:39.469
SO THE EPI...

16:39.469 --> 16:42.472
(people continue
speaking indistinctly)

16:42.472 --> 16:43.473
(inhales deeply)

16:43.473 --> 16:45.575
I WAS MOVING TOO FAST
AND I MADE A MISTAKE.

16:45.575 --> 16:47.307
YOU THINK?

16:47.307 --> 16:49.279
(pager beeps)

16:49.279 --> 16:52.612
(people continue
speaking indistinctly)

16:52.612 --> 16:54.614
BOY, YOU GOT A MEAN STREAK.

16:54.614 --> 16:57.417
I MEAN, YOU LOOK LIKE
A NICE GIRL, BUT...

16:57.417 --> 16:59.349
SCRATCH THE SURFACE...

16:59.349 --> 17:00.590
(chuckles)

17:00.590 --> 17:03.423
(woman speaks indistinctly
over p.a.)

17:03.423 --> 17:05.425
(lowered voice)
DON'T MESS WITH THE NICE ONES.

17:05.425 --> 17:07.357
MNH-MNH.

17:10.600 --> 17:13.603
(siren wailing)

17:17.437 --> 17:18.638
(wailing continues)

17:18.638 --> 17:22.372
(babbling)

17:23.643 --> 17:26.316
I THINK I STOLE A BABY.

17:26.316 --> 17:29.479
(continues babbling)

17:35.285 --> 17:36.286
OKAY, FIRST OF ALL,
YOU DIDN'T STEAL THE BABY.

17:36.286 --> 17:37.287
SHE'S YOUR BABY.

17:37.287 --> 17:39.259
WHAT YOU DID IS,

17:39.259 --> 17:41.431
YOU TOOK HER FOR A NAP...

17:41.431 --> 17:42.492
(Zola babbling)

17:42.492 --> 17:45.395
IN A VERY ODD LOCATION

17:45.395 --> 17:48.238
AND YOU FAILED
TO ANSWER YOUR PHONE.

17:48.238 --> 17:50.400
BUT, YOU KNOW, MANY PEOPLE
FIND ALL THE TECHNOLOGY

17:50.400 --> 17:52.302
IN OUR LIVES
TO BE INTRUSIVE.

17:52.302 --> 17:54.544
SO YOU'RE NOT THE FIRST PERSON
WHO DIDN'T ANSWER HER PHONE...

17:54.544 --> 17:56.506
(Zola babbles)
OR HER PAGER.

17:58.348 --> 18:00.350
WELL, AND, YOU KNOW,
ALL WE HAVE TO DO IS--

18:00.350 --> 18:02.512
I-IS FIND A REASON WHY
YOU WERE AWOL FOR AN HOUR.

18:02.512 --> 18:04.184
FOUR...

18:04.184 --> 18:05.215
(babbling)

18:05.215 --> 18:07.357
HOURS.

18:07.357 --> 18:09.419
JANET WAS GONNA TAKE
THE BABY, SO...

18:09.419 --> 18:10.490
I TOOK OFF.

18:10.490 --> 18:12.362
OKAY. OKAY.

18:12.362 --> 18:13.423
(claps hands together)

18:13.423 --> 18:15.225
YOU KNOW,
PEOPLE MAKE MISTAKES.

18:15.225 --> 18:18.228
I MEAN, I ALMOST KILLED ALEX
IN THE O.R. TODAY.

18:18.228 --> 18:19.469
SO WE'LL JUST FIGURE IT OUT.

18:19.469 --> 18:20.570
HOW?

18:20.570 --> 18:22.272
I DON'T KNOW.
NO.

18:22.272 --> 18:23.433
HOW'D YOU ALMOST KILL ALEX?

18:23.433 --> 18:26.306
WITH A C.C. OF EPI.

18:26.306 --> 18:28.578
WHAT-WHATEVER.
YOU KNOW, HE'LL BE FINE.

18:28.578 --> 18:31.241
JUST, UM...

18:31.241 --> 18:33.513
JUST STAY HERE.
I'LL FIX THIS.

18:33.513 --> 18:36.446
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?
I'M GONNA FIX IT.

18:36.446 --> 18:37.587
(door opens)

18:37.587 --> 18:39.349
(coos)

18:39.349 --> 18:41.421
HAND ME A 10-BLADE, PLEASE.

18:41.421 --> 18:43.353
OKAY.

18:43.353 --> 18:44.524
HAVE TO BE CAREFUL
NOT TO CUT TOO DEEP

18:44.524 --> 18:46.256
INTO THE OMENTUM.

18:46.256 --> 18:47.527
UH, DR. WEBBER.

18:47.527 --> 18:49.359
YES.

18:49.359 --> 18:51.261
HI. UH, TEDDY ALTMAN HERE.

18:51.261 --> 18:52.502
YEAH, NICE TO SEE YOU.

18:52.502 --> 18:56.306
I-I THOUGHT THAT DR. BAILEY
WAS JUST OBSERVING.

18:56.306 --> 18:59.239
YEAH, WELL, SHE'S HERE, SO SHE'S
GONNA MAKE HERSELF USEFUL.

18:59.239 --> 19:00.340
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

19:00.340 --> 19:01.571
DR. WEBBER, I'M A SURGEON.

19:01.571 --> 19:03.413
THAT'S THE WORD
ON THE STREET.

19:03.413 --> 19:05.315
YOU HAVE AN ATTENDING
ASSISTING YOU

19:05.315 --> 19:07.547
IN A SIMPLE
SUBCUTANEOUS DEVICE INSERTION.

19:07.547 --> 19:11.521
YOU RUSHED HENRY INTO SURGERY
WITH AN HOUR'S NOTICE.

19:11.521 --> 19:14.424
WHAT... WH-WHAT ARE YOU
NOT TELLING ME?

19:14.424 --> 19:15.485
DR. ALTMAN--

19:15.485 --> 19:17.287
IS THERE SOMETHING
THAT HE DIDN'T TELL ME

19:17.287 --> 19:18.388
ABOUT HIS CHECKUPS?

19:18.388 --> 19:20.560
I MEAN, IS--IS--IS HIS
HbA1c TO HIGH?

19:20.560 --> 19:21.561
HERE WE GO.

19:21.561 --> 19:22.592
LOOK, I AM A DOCTOR

19:22.592 --> 19:24.464
AND IKNOWWHEN SOMETHING
IS WRONG,

19:24.464 --> 19:25.595
ANDSOMETHINGIS WRONG.

19:25.595 --> 19:27.637
DR. ALTMAN,
I'M FOND OF YOU,

19:27.637 --> 19:30.270
SO I'M GONNA COUNT TO 30
IN MY HEAD

19:30.270 --> 19:31.471
BEFORE I CALL SECURITY.

19:31.471 --> 19:34.304
RICHARD, I'M--I'M JUST
ASKING YOU--

19:34.304 --> 19:36.476
GET OUT OF MY O.R.
RIGHT NOW.

19:36.476 --> 19:39.479
(suction gurgling)

19:44.554 --> 19:46.356
(door closes)

19:46.356 --> 19:47.487
(instrument clatters)

19:50.420 --> 19:51.491
I DON'T NEED TO BE HERE.

19:51.491 --> 19:52.562
THEY JUST WANT TO OBSERVE ME

19:52.562 --> 19:54.364
AND MAKE SURE
I DON'T PASS OUT AGAIN.

19:54.364 --> 19:56.296
MM.

19:56.296 --> 19:57.627
NOT A BAD IDEA.

19:57.627 --> 19:59.469
HOW'D THE KID DO?

19:59.469 --> 20:01.371
HE HAS
A FEW SPINAL FRACTURES,

20:01.371 --> 20:03.303
BUT IT LOOKS LIKE
HE'S OUT OF THE WOODS.

20:03.303 --> 20:05.305
YOU NEED TO MAKE UP
WITH YOUR FRIENDS.

20:05.305 --> 20:06.506
WHATEVER.

20:06.506 --> 20:08.508
ONE OF THEM
ALMOST KILLED YOU TODAY.

20:08.508 --> 20:09.639
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.

20:09.639 --> 20:11.411
NOBODY HAS YOUR BACK.

20:11.411 --> 20:12.612
NOBODY IS LOOKING OUT
FOR YOU.

20:12.612 --> 20:14.414
THAT'S WHEN ACCIDENTS HAPPEN,
OKAY?

20:14.414 --> 20:17.317
THIS ISN'T A PERSONAL PROBLEM.
THIS IS A PROFESSIONAL ONE.

20:17.317 --> 20:20.650
IT MAKES YOU A BAD HIRE.

20:20.650 --> 20:22.392
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

20:22.392 --> 20:23.523
(people speaking indistinctly)

20:23.523 --> 20:26.396
ALSO, IT MEANS THAT
I HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT YOU,

20:26.396 --> 20:28.558
BECAUSE NO ONE ELSE IS.

20:28.558 --> 20:30.700
AND I DON'T WANT TO WORRY
ABOUT YOU.

20:30.700 --> 20:35.335
I'D MUCH RATHER BE KICKING
YOUR ASS ON MY PEDS WARD.

20:35.335 --> 20:38.608
(woman speaking indistinctly
over p.a.)

20:38.608 --> 20:40.510
(sighs)

20:40.510 --> 20:42.472
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

20:42.472 --> 20:45.475
(footsteps receding)

20:45.475 --> 20:47.477
(people speaking indistinctly)

20:47.477 --> 20:50.350
(beeping continues)

20:50.350 --> 20:52.352
(sighs)

20:52.352 --> 20:55.625
(indistinct conversations)

20:55.625 --> 20:56.686
CRISTINA.

20:58.588 --> 21:02.462
(indistinct conversations
continue)

21:02.462 --> 21:05.465
DO YOU WANT TO SIT
AND TALK FOR A MINUTE?

21:05.465 --> 21:06.536
(elevator bell dings)

21:06.536 --> 21:07.737
(doors open)

21:07.737 --> 21:09.699
I DO. I...

21:09.699 --> 21:12.542
I REALLY VERY MUCH DO,

21:12.542 --> 21:14.544
BUT I HAVE TO GO
DO SOMETHING RIGHT NOW,

21:14.544 --> 21:15.745
AND IT CAN'T WAIT.

21:15.745 --> 21:17.677
PLEASE...

21:17.677 --> 21:19.749
PLEASE BELIEVE THAT
I WANT TO TALK TO YOU

21:19.749 --> 21:22.752
AND I'M NOT BLOWING YOU OFF
BECAUSE I'M A TERRIBLE PERSON

21:22.752 --> 21:25.485
OR BECAUSE I DON'T CARE
ABOUT YOU.

21:25.485 --> 21:26.686
NONE OF THAT IS TRUE.

21:26.686 --> 21:29.589
(indistinct conversations
continue)

21:29.589 --> 21:31.491
(clicks button)

21:33.393 --> 21:36.596
(indistinct conversations)

21:36.596 --> 21:38.498
SHE OKAY?

21:38.498 --> 21:39.699
(sighs) UH, NO CHANGE.

21:39.699 --> 21:41.631
I JUST...

21:41.631 --> 21:43.433
I DON'T WANT TO MESS THIS UP

21:43.433 --> 21:44.774
LIKE I MESSED UP
EVERYTHING ELSE.

21:44.774 --> 21:47.477
WHAT? YOU WERE GREAT
IN THE O.R.

21:47.477 --> 21:49.409
I WASN'T THE GUNTHER.

21:49.409 --> 21:51.541
I WAS
A SUPER-DUPER ASSISTANT.

21:51.541 --> 21:53.743
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

21:53.743 --> 21:56.546
ARE THEY GONNA FIRE ME
AS CHIEF RESIDENT?

21:56.546 --> 21:57.747
NO.

21:57.747 --> 21:59.549
IT WAS YOUR FIRST DAY.

21:59.549 --> 22:00.750
THEY'LL JUST...

22:00.750 --> 22:02.592
MAKE YOU DO IT AGAIN.

22:02.592 --> 22:04.494
(chuckles)

22:06.426 --> 22:07.557
(sighs)

22:07.557 --> 22:10.500
IT'S TIME TO PLACE
THE DEVICE.

22:10.500 --> 22:14.434
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

22:14.434 --> 22:15.565
(clears throat)

22:15.565 --> 22:17.467
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO?

22:17.467 --> 22:19.569
PLACE THE DEVICE.

22:21.441 --> 22:24.744
SIR, IS THERE ANYTHING
YOU WANT TO TELL ME?

22:24.744 --> 22:26.516
DON'T SCREW IT UP.

22:26.516 --> 22:28.718
(beeping continues)

22:30.620 --> 22:33.553
A SURGEON
DOING THE EARLY STAGES

22:33.553 --> 22:36.556
OF HUMAN TRIALS
ONHISEXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE

22:36.556 --> 22:38.588
NEVER HANDS OVER THE REINS

22:38.588 --> 22:39.659
TO SOMEONE ELSE, EVER,

22:39.659 --> 22:41.491
UNLESS SOMETHING IS WRONG.

22:41.491 --> 22:42.792
ALTMAN SAID THIS WAS WEIRD,

22:42.792 --> 22:44.734
BUT I JUST THOUGHT
SHE WAS BEING A WIFE.
BAILEY...

22:44.734 --> 22:46.736
ARE YOU DRINKING AGAIN?

22:46.736 --> 22:47.737
(scoffs)

22:47.737 --> 22:50.470
OOH,
THAT WOULD EXPLAIN A LOT.

22:50.470 --> 22:52.602
YES, IT WOULD. GOD, I WISH
IT WERE THAT SIMPLE.

22:52.602 --> 22:54.744
PICK UP THOSE FORCEPS,
DR. BAILEY.

22:54.744 --> 22:56.746
(exhales sharply)

22:59.509 --> 23:01.611
(stepstool clatters)

23:01.611 --> 23:04.614
NOW WATCH
THE SUPERFICIAL ARTERIES.

23:04.614 --> 23:05.685
THAT'S WHERE IT GETS DICEY.

23:05.685 --> 23:07.687
LET'S GET MORE RETRACTION,
DR. GREY.

23:07.687 --> 23:09.689
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

23:09.689 --> 23:11.821
RIGHT. OKAY. DON'T--DON'T--
DON'T RUSH IT.

23:11.821 --> 23:14.694
ALL RIGHT. YOU SEE
THOSE BLOOD VESSELS?

23:14.694 --> 23:15.825
YEP.

23:15.825 --> 23:19.499
IMPLANT THE DEVICE
AS CLOSE TO THOSE AS POSSIBLE.

23:19.499 --> 23:21.501
WITHOUT THEIR OXYGEN SUPPLY,

23:21.501 --> 23:23.873
THE ISLET CELLS
WOULD DIE OFF.

23:23.873 --> 23:26.576
GOOD.

23:26.576 --> 23:28.578
AND EVENTUALLY THE VESSELS

23:28.578 --> 23:31.711
WILL JUST TAKE OVER
THE OXYGEN DELIVERY

23:31.711 --> 23:33.783
TO THE DEVICE COMPLETELY.

23:33.783 --> 23:36.516
(Miranda) LOOK AT THAT.

23:36.516 --> 23:37.587
IT'S INTERESTING, RIGHT?

23:37.587 --> 23:38.788
(chuckles)

23:38.788 --> 23:40.850
IT'S ACTUALLY
KIND OF BEAUTIFUL.

23:40.850 --> 23:41.851
(chuckles)

23:41.851 --> 23:43.753
NICE WORK, DR. BAILEY.

23:43.753 --> 23:46.526
CLOSE HIM UP.

23:46.526 --> 23:49.659
(beeping continues)

23:49.659 --> 23:51.861
(door opens)

23:51.861 --> 23:54.804
DID--DID--DID HE JUST...

23:56.806 --> 23:58.838
HE JUST LEFT?

24:00.610 --> 24:01.911
GET UP.

24:01.911 --> 24:04.744
NO. I'M UNDER
24-HOUR OBSERVATION

24:04.744 --> 24:06.846
BECAUSE YOU ALMOST KILLED ME!

24:06.846 --> 24:08.848
I REVEALED AN ARRHYTHMIA
YOU DIDN'T KNOW YOU HAVE.

24:08.848 --> 24:10.580
I PROBABLY SAVED YOUR LIFE.

24:10.580 --> 24:11.921
I'LL RUN AN E.K.G.
ON YOU LATER. JUST GET UP.

24:11.921 --> 24:13.783
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO HAVE
MY BACK.

24:13.783 --> 24:15.555
I MADE A MISTAKE.

24:15.555 --> 24:16.826
ALL RIGHT? I-I-I WAS DRUNK,

24:16.826 --> 24:18.758
I WAS PISSED OFF--
OH, FOR THE LOVE OF G--

24:18.758 --> 24:20.730
NO, I SCREWED UP!
YOU SCREW UP ALL THE TIME.

24:20.730 --> 24:22.932
I DON'T HAVE ANYBODY.
YOU GUYS ARE ALL I HAVE.

24:22.932 --> 24:24.894
YOU HAVE TO FORGIVE ME!
FINE!

24:24.894 --> 24:26.636
WHATEVER. FORGIVEN.

24:26.636 --> 24:29.639
JUST... GET UP
OUT OF THE DAMN BED.

24:31.801 --> 24:33.803
OH, SORRY. I WAS PAGED HERE.

24:33.803 --> 24:34.944
THAT WAS US.

24:34.944 --> 24:36.746
WE PAGED YOUR WIFE, TOO.
DO YOU KNOW WHERE SHE IS?

24:36.746 --> 24:37.947
WELL, THAT IS THE QUESTION
OF THE HOUR.

24:37.947 --> 24:39.779
I HAVE NO IDEA WHERE SHE IS.

24:39.779 --> 24:41.581
WELL,
WE'LL FILL HER IN LATER.

24:41.581 --> 24:42.712
SHUT THE DOOR, PLEASE.

24:44.854 --> 24:46.856
DR. WEBBER JUST INFORMED ME

24:46.856 --> 24:49.659
THAT HE TAMPERED
WITH THE DRUGS AND PLACEBOS

24:49.659 --> 24:50.960
IN YOUR CLINICAL TRIAL.

24:50.960 --> 24:52.792
EXCUSE ME?

24:52.792 --> 24:53.923
UH...

24:53.923 --> 24:55.665
N-NO.

24:55.665 --> 24:57.767
IT WAS, UH... MEREDITH.

24:57.767 --> 24:59.969
DR. GREY APPARENTLY
WAS COVERING FOR HIM.

24:59.969 --> 25:02.772
SHE KNEW AND SHE...

25:02.772 --> 25:04.604
WAS TRYING TO PROTECT HIM.

25:06.676 --> 25:08.738
YOU HAVE MY APOLOGIES.

25:11.611 --> 25:13.613
I DESTROYED YOUR TRIAL.

25:23.222 --> 25:25.024
(door opens)

25:25.024 --> 25:27.026
(lowered voice)
SHE WASN'T COVERING FOR YOU.

25:27.026 --> 25:28.297
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING?

25:28.297 --> 25:31.060
I'M PROTECTING YOUR WIFE.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

25:31.060 --> 25:32.101
THIS IS WRONG,
AND YOU KNOW THAT.

25:32.101 --> 25:33.532
WHAT ARE YOU TRYING
TO DO TO HER?

25:33.532 --> 25:36.305
SHE WAS TRYING TO SAVE ADELE.
SHE WAS TRYING TO SAVEME.

25:36.305 --> 25:38.537
AT WHAT POINT ARE YOU GONNA
STOP PUNISHING HER FOR THAT?

25:45.615 --> 25:48.077
AND THERE'S NO PAIN
IN YOUR ABDOMEN?

25:48.077 --> 25:50.149
NOPE.

25:50.149 --> 25:52.181
REALLY? OR ARE YOU
JUST BEING STOIC FOR ME?

25:52.181 --> 25:54.553
I'M A MAN IN A GOWN. I CAN'T
PRETEND TO BE BRAVE AND STRONG.

25:54.553 --> 25:55.625
YOU CAN.

25:55.625 --> 25:57.126
(chuckles)

25:57.126 --> 25:59.128
I KINDA LOST IT TODAY.

26:00.229 --> 26:02.191
DR. WEBBER KICKED ME OUT
OF THE O.R.

26:02.191 --> 26:03.332
REALLY?

26:03.332 --> 26:05.595
OKAY, UM, SO...

26:05.595 --> 26:10.299
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

26:10.299 --> 26:13.572
YOU KNOW HOW WE BOTH FIGURED
THAT SINCE I WAS A DOCTOR

26:13.572 --> 26:16.145
THAT...
I WOULD BE REALLY CALM

26:16.145 --> 26:18.577
WHILE YOU WERE HAVING
YOUR SURGERY?
MM-HMM.

26:18.577 --> 26:20.349
THAT MAY NOT BE THE CASE.

26:20.349 --> 26:23.112
(beeping continues)

26:23.112 --> 26:25.214
YOU'RE JUST A MESS, LIKE ANY
ORDINARY WIFE WOULD BE?

26:25.214 --> 26:27.586
YEAH, IT'S PATHETIC.

26:27.586 --> 26:29.158
(sighs)

26:29.158 --> 26:31.090
I THINK IT'S ADORABLE.

26:32.291 --> 26:35.224
I HAVE
A CHRONIC TUMOR CONDITION.

26:35.224 --> 26:37.266
I'M A FREQUENT FLYER
IN THE O.R.

26:40.369 --> 26:43.172
I'M GONNA BE A BASKET CASE
EVERY TIME.

26:43.172 --> 26:44.634
SO SAD.

26:46.305 --> 26:49.308
(people speaking indistinctly)

26:53.112 --> 26:54.644
MM.

26:54.644 --> 26:56.185
(sighs)

26:56.185 --> 26:59.118
UH, IF YOU'RE HEADED IN THERE,
YOU MAY WANT TO WAIT.

26:59.118 --> 27:01.620
THEY'RE ACTING LIKE HE JUST
CAME BACK FROM THE WARS.

27:01.620 --> 27:02.692
(woman speaking indistinctly
over p.a.)

27:02.692 --> 27:04.193
WHAT?

27:04.193 --> 27:06.325
SOMETHING HAPPENED
WITH THE CHIEF.

27:06.325 --> 27:09.158
W--

27:09.158 --> 27:12.261
(people speaking indistinctly)

27:12.261 --> 27:13.402
(sighs) WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

27:13.402 --> 27:15.665
WE'VE BEEN TRYING
TO REACH YOU FOR HOURS.

27:15.665 --> 27:17.206
I'M SORRY.

27:17.206 --> 27:19.208
WHERE'S ZOLA?

27:19.208 --> 27:22.211
(people continue
speaking indistinctly)

27:29.378 --> 27:32.251
HEY. SUSANNAH JUST GOT OUT
OF SURGERY,

27:32.251 --> 27:34.253
AND IT WENT AS WELL
AS IT COULD HAVE.

27:34.253 --> 27:36.355
(exhales)
WE'RE NOT GONNA KNOW MUCH
FOR A LITTLE WHILE.

27:36.355 --> 27:37.656
OKAY.

27:37.656 --> 27:39.288
LOOK RIGHT HERE.

27:39.288 --> 27:41.360
WE HAD SUCH AN AWFUL FIGHT
RIGHT BEFORE.

27:41.360 --> 27:43.262
I...

27:43.262 --> 27:44.694
I BROUGHT UP HER MOTHER
IN AN ARGUMENT,

27:44.694 --> 27:47.336
AND TH-THAT--THAT IS
ONE OF THE RED BUTTONS.

27:47.336 --> 27:50.339
I SWORE I WOULD NEVER DO THAT.
WHY--WHY DID I DO THAT?

27:50.339 --> 27:53.242
SHE'LL FORGIVE YOU.
YOU SAVED HER LIFE.

27:53.242 --> 27:55.374
MAYBE FOR A WHILE,
AND THEN SHE'LL GET BETTER

27:55.374 --> 27:57.446
AND SHE'LL REMEMBER
WHY SHE GOT OUT OF THE CAR.

27:57.446 --> 27:59.378
MAYBE SHE WON'T.
YOU KNOW?

27:59.378 --> 28:04.383
MAYBE YOU BOTH JUST DECIDE
TO FORGET, MOVE ON...

28:04.383 --> 28:06.255
PRETEND IT NEVER HAPPENED.

28:06.255 --> 28:07.686
DOES THAT WORK?

28:07.686 --> 28:10.319
IT CAN'T HURT TO TRY.

28:11.690 --> 28:13.692
YOU MARRIED?

28:15.394 --> 28:17.396
I-I'M SORRY. IT'S--
IT'S NOT MY BUSINESS.

28:17.396 --> 28:18.728
I DIDN'T MEAN TO PRY.

28:18.728 --> 28:20.329
OH, THAT'S ALL RIGHT.
YES.

28:20.329 --> 28:22.401
YES, I'M MARRIED.

28:22.401 --> 28:23.773
(door opens)

28:23.773 --> 28:25.404
WHAT DID YOU DO?!

28:25.404 --> 28:27.406
I WANT YOU TO SHUT THE DOOR

28:27.406 --> 28:29.338
AND THEN I WANT YOU
TO SIT DOWN.

28:29.338 --> 28:31.340
YOU'RE THROWING
YOUR WHOLE CAREER AWAY

28:31.340 --> 28:32.742
FOR THAT DAMN GIRL?

28:32.742 --> 28:34.744
THIS IS NOT THE END
OF MY CAREER.

28:34.744 --> 28:36.746
THE FDA WILL NEVER COME
ANYWHERE NEAR YOU AGAIN.

28:36.746 --> 28:39.288
THAT IS THE END
OF YOUR ISLET CELL TRIAL,

28:39.288 --> 28:41.350
NOT TO MENTION ANY OTHER THING
YOU MIGHT BE COOKING UP WITH

28:41.350 --> 28:44.223
THE FDA--
SIT DOWN!

28:44.223 --> 28:46.395
YOU... (grunts)

28:50.399 --> 28:51.430
OPEN IT...

28:51.430 --> 28:54.263
WHAT...

28:54.263 --> 28:56.365
AND READ THE FIRST PAGE.

28:56.365 --> 28:58.808
"THE ARTIFICIAL PANCREAS:
A CURE FOR DIABET--"

28:58.808 --> 29:00.509
HOW ABOUT
"THE ARTIFICIAL PANCREAS:

29:00.509 --> 29:04.273
"A-A HUGE MISSED OPPORTUNITY
THAT YOU BLEW

29:04.273 --> 29:05.514
BECAUSE YOU--"
READ THE NEXT LINE.

29:07.376 --> 29:10.319
"PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR:
MIRANDA BAIL--"

29:11.480 --> 29:13.322
IT'S YOURS NOW.

29:13.322 --> 29:16.255
I HAVE NO PENDING TRIALS
WITH THE FDA.

29:17.426 --> 29:19.328
(sighs)

29:21.831 --> 29:24.794
EVER SINCE HER SURGERY,
ZOLA'S HAD WEEKLY BLOOD TESTS,

29:24.794 --> 29:26.465
AND, UH, THE RESULTS
I GOT TODAY

29:26.465 --> 29:29.368
WERE A LITTLE WEIRD, SO I
WANTED TO TAKE A LOOK AT HER.

29:29.368 --> 29:30.769
YEAH, AND, YOU KNOW,
WITH BABIES,

29:30.769 --> 29:32.471
I MEAN, WHEN A DOCTOR CALLS--
I GOT WORRIED,

29:32.471 --> 29:33.803
SO I JUST RUSHED HER RIGHT IN,

29:33.803 --> 29:36.375
AND I MUST HAVE LEFT MY PHONE
IN THE DAY CARE CENTER.

29:36.375 --> 29:37.476
AND YOUR PAGER.

29:37.476 --> 29:40.349
MY PAGER I HAD TO TURN IN
BECAUSE THEY FIRED ME.

29:40.349 --> 29:42.511
WHAT'S WRONG WITH HER?

29:44.283 --> 29:46.455
HER WHITE COUNT WAS ELEVATED.

29:46.455 --> 29:48.787
14.5. UM, I WANTED TO
MAKE SURE THERE WASN'T

29:48.787 --> 29:51.861
A POST-OP INFECTION
OR A C.S.F. LEAK OR SOMETHING.

29:51.861 --> 29:54.523
UM, ON MY EXAM,
SHE LOOKS FINE.

29:54.523 --> 29:56.525
(Zola babbling)
NO SIGNS OF SPINAL SHOCK.

29:56.525 --> 29:59.428
I RE-RAN HER C.B.C.,
AND HER WHITE COUNT WAS 8.

29:59.428 --> 30:01.370
TOTALLY NORMAL.

30:01.370 --> 30:02.832
MUST HAVE JUST BEEN
A STRESS REACTANT...
(continues babbling)

30:02.832 --> 30:06.375
OR A FLUKE IN THE LABS,
'CAUSE, UH, WELL, SHE'S FINE.

30:12.811 --> 30:14.513
IT'S TRUE.

30:14.513 --> 30:17.416
C.S.F. LEAKS ARE A PROBLEM
WITH SPINA BIFIDA BABIES.

30:17.416 --> 30:20.489
THAT'S... THAT'S GREAT
YOU CAUGHT THAT.

30:30.559 --> 30:33.562
(Zola babbling)

30:37.566 --> 30:40.569
I'M SORRY. I DIDN'T MEAN
FOR ANY OF THIS...

30:40.569 --> 30:43.572
I DIDN'T MEAN
FOR ANY OF THIS TO HAPPEN.

30:45.844 --> 30:47.476
I KNOW.

30:47.476 --> 30:48.547
I KNOW.

30:51.520 --> 30:53.352
I STILL DON'T UNDERSTAND

30:53.352 --> 30:55.854
WHAT YOU POSSIBLY
COULD'VE BEEN THINKING.

30:55.854 --> 30:58.327
THEY FIRED ME.
(door closes)

30:58.327 --> 31:00.329
JANET BASICALLY TOLD ME
THEY WERE GONNA TAKE ZOLA AWAY.

31:00.329 --> 31:02.892
I MEAN, POSSIBLY SEND HER
BACK TO MALAWI.

31:02.892 --> 31:05.564
YOU AND ME?

31:05.564 --> 31:09.868
I JUST NEEDED SOME TIME.

31:09.868 --> 31:12.541
I JUST NEEDED TO HOLD HER
AND LOOK AT HER

31:12.541 --> 31:15.644
AND JUST THINK ABOUT
HOW EVERYTHING...

31:15.644 --> 31:18.877
EVERYTHING
GOT SO SCREWED UP.

31:18.877 --> 31:20.509
(exhales)

31:22.551 --> 31:24.353
YOU SHOULD TAKE ZOLA.

31:24.353 --> 31:26.885
JANET HAS A PROBLEM WITH ME,
NOT WITH YOU.

31:26.885 --> 31:28.887
AND WE NEED TO DO
WHATEVER WE CAN

31:28.887 --> 31:30.489
