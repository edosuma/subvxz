00:07.800 --> 00:08.960
Whoa!

00:08.960 --> 00:11.160
That's 14 minutes
till your fucking bus, Reece.

00:11.160 --> 00:12.960
Bang out of order!

00:12.960 --> 00:14.960
Four shouts water rule!

00:14.960 --> 00:16.960
What if I stay in bed now?
What's the five shouts rule?

00:16.960 --> 00:19.320
Fucking fire!

00:19.320 --> 00:21.960
How am I supposed to go to school
if I don't even have my uniform?!

00:21.960 --> 00:24.960
I put it next
to your fucking bed, Reece!

00:24.960 --> 00:27.960
Oh. Thanks, Mum.

00:27.960 --> 00:29.960
You're fucking welcome.

00:37.480 --> 00:39.960
Go on. Oh, wait.

00:39.960 --> 00:41.160
You forgot my kiss.

00:42.960 --> 00:44.480
Hang on, what?
We don't even do that.

00:44.480 --> 00:46.960
You were gonna though, weren't you?
Soft shite!

00:46.960 --> 00:48.960
No, I weren't.
You're off you head, you, you know.

00:48.960 --> 00:51.800
Come here. Mwah!

00:51.800 --> 00:52.960
Have a good day. Love you.

00:52.960 --> 00:54.800
Love you.

'Don't Sweat The Technique'
by Eric B & Rakim

00:58.960 --> 01:00.640
Oh, my God.

01:01.960 --> 01:03.480
What's that?

01:06.960 --> 01:07.960
Morning, Pat, lad.

01:07.960 --> 01:09.800
♪ Don't sweat the technique

01:15.960 --> 01:18.960
♪ Don't sweat the technique

See you soon.

01:50.000 --> 01:52.960

Mm.

02:07.960 --> 02:08.960
Mike Woodworth's.

02:08.960 --> 02:10.960
Yeah, how'd you get that?

02:10.960 --> 02:13.960
Kinda looks like him.
LAUGHTER

02:14.960 --> 02:18.480
You got 12 out of 15, girl. Go 'ead.
LAUGHTER

02:18.480 --> 02:19.960
What are you gonna do with them?

02:19.960 --> 02:21.960
It's ammunition, innit?
If they ever wind me up,

02:21.960 --> 02:24.960
then I'm putting their tiny cocks
on the Year 11 group chat.

02:24.960 --> 02:26.960
LAUGHTER
But if I'm just starving,

02:26.960 --> 02:28.960
like today, I actually forgot
to have my breakfast.

02:28.960 --> 02:31.960
So I threatened Sevo
unless he got me these.

02:31.960 --> 02:33.960
LAUGHTER

02:33.960 --> 02:34.960
Lads are so thick.
Hm.

02:34.960 --> 02:37.960
You ask,
and they send within seconds.

02:37.960 --> 02:39.960
We could make our own version
of Guess Who?

02:39.960 --> 02:43.960
Has your cock
got FIFA in the background?

02:43.960 --> 02:47.480
Hmm, has your cock got a wide base
but a narrow head?

02:47.480 --> 02:49.960
LAUGHTER

02:49.960 --> 02:53.960
Hey, speaking of bell ends,
who's this?

02:53.960 --> 02:55.960
Looks like he's just tested positive

02:55.960 --> 02:57.960
for defo getting
his head caved in today.

03:02.960 --> 03:04.800
That's that posh muppet
from earlier.

03:04.800 --> 03:05.960
Eh?

03:07.960 --> 03:09.800
Dickhead.

03:09.800 --> 03:12.160
Ooh!
You're in trouble!

03:12.160 --> 03:14.960
That was dead funny, yesterday.

03:14.960 --> 03:16.960
Reckon she'll snitch, though?
Nah.

03:16.960 --> 03:19.960
Chinese people don't grass, lad.
It's not part of the culture.

03:19.960 --> 03:23.960
What I really need to know, Reece,
is was it racially motivated?

03:23.960 --> 03:25.960
YOU'RE racially motivated, lad.

03:25.960 --> 03:27.960
The mouse was in
Li Wei's pencil case.

03:27.960 --> 03:29.960
Li Hua is in 11E.

03:29.960 --> 03:32.960
So let's say we forget
about all this expelling silliness,

03:32.960 --> 03:35.320
and I'll say nothing to no-one
about you being...

03:35.320 --> 03:38.960
..the top dog
for the Ku Klux Klan Woolton branch.

03:38.960 --> 03:41.800
Sit down, Reece.

03:41.800 --> 03:44.960
I get it.
Practical jokes can be funny.

03:44.960 --> 03:47.960
A friend of mine found images of me
and his wife on my computer.

03:47.960 --> 03:49.960
He was convinced
that they were real,

03:49.960 --> 03:51.960
but they were just photoshops.

03:51.960 --> 03:55.960
Very real-looking photoshops.

03:57.960 --> 03:59.000
Anyway, Reece,

03:59.000 --> 04:01.960
this has been a continual pattern
of poor behaviour,

04:01.960 --> 04:04.480
and I can't ignore the complaints
of the East Asian Society.

04:04.480 --> 04:05.960
You what?

04:05.960 --> 04:08.640
She's not even Asian!

04:08.640 --> 04:11.960
We cannot, and we will not, stand by

04:11.960 --> 04:14.960
while toxic western men
like Reece Duffy

04:14.960 --> 04:17.960
exhibit abhorrent behaviour
aimed at our community.

04:17.960 --> 04:20.800
SPEAKS MANDARIN

04:20.800 --> 04:23.640
You gave me no choice, Reece.
I've already informed your mother.

04:23.640 --> 04:25.960
'You're gonna answer my FaceTime!

04:25.960 --> 04:27.960
'Expelled?

04:27.960 --> 04:29.960
'Are you fucking serious, gobshite?!

04:29.960 --> 04:33.960
'You know, I've always thought
I was doing a good job with you.

04:34.960 --> 04:37.000
'I was determined I wasn't gonna
let you be affected

04:37.000 --> 04:39.480
'by your dad not being around,
and with this,

04:39.480 --> 04:41.960
'you're making me question whether
I've been a good mother at all.'

04:47.960 --> 04:49.960
Isn't it funny how we're mates,

04:49.960 --> 04:52.960
but if your mum would let me
bury my face in her arse,

04:52.960 --> 04:54.960
I would without hesitation?

04:54.960 --> 04:56.000
Isn't that weird?

04:56.000 --> 04:57.960
I've never really thought
about it, mate.

04:57.960 --> 04:59.960
Would we really not
be mates anymore?

04:59.960 --> 05:00.960
We'd get through it.

05:00.960 --> 05:01.960
I suppose, yeah, but...

05:01.960 --> 05:04.480
I doubt you'd ever come round
for tea again, though.

05:04.480 --> 05:06.960
Nah. See, now, that's a problem,

05:06.960 --> 05:09.960
cos your ma makes
a sick pork casserole.

05:09.960 --> 05:11.800
Oh, I'm gonna have to rethink.

05:17.160 --> 05:20.320
All right, Wigbert, lad.
All right, fucking Barnaby, lad.

05:20.320 --> 05:22.960
Fucking Norman, lad.

05:22.960 --> 05:24.960
Fucking Npeter
with a silent "N" at the start.

05:24.960 --> 05:26.320
Let me guess, then.

05:26.320 --> 05:27.960
What, your sisters have
hyphenated names

05:27.960 --> 05:31.960
to try and sound posher?
Like Ruby-Mae or Louise-Rose?

05:31.960 --> 05:35.160
Ted, how does he know
your little sister's name?

05:35.160 --> 05:36.960
You'll get pasted, lad.

05:36.960 --> 05:38.960
Wait, I need him. Paste him later.

05:38.960 --> 05:42.960
Agree to everything I say
to Mr Meacher. Yeah?

05:42.960 --> 05:44.960
So, let me get this straight, Reece.

05:44.960 --> 05:48.960
You are offering
to look after Christopher here

05:48.960 --> 05:51.960
as a kind of last chance saloon?

05:51.960 --> 05:53.960
Well, I feel for him, being new.

05:53.960 --> 05:55.000
Look at the state of him.

05:55.000 --> 05:57.960
He looks so posh,
like he doesn't just play rugby,

05:57.960 --> 05:59.960
but he plays it with Prince William

05:59.960 --> 06:01.960
constantly bumming him
around the pitch.

06:01.960 --> 06:05.960
I know that I can't do great things,

06:05.960 --> 06:08.160
but I can do small things,

06:08.160 --> 06:10.480
and if we all do small things,

06:10.480 --> 06:12.960
then together
we can do a great thing,

06:12.960 --> 06:14.960
like Uncle Dale...

06:18.960 --> 06:19.960
...and turn it around.

06:24.960 --> 06:28.640
OK, Reece, then report back here
on Friday at 9am.

06:28.640 --> 06:30.960
If I'm happy
and Christopher's happy,

06:30.960 --> 06:32.960
we'll discuss you staying here.

06:33.960 --> 06:35.960
Close the door on the way out.

06:37.160 --> 06:41.640
So, what did we think
of the character of Mr Darcy

06:41.640 --> 06:43.960
at the beginning of the story?

06:43.960 --> 06:45.960
Why are you worried about
what we think about Mr Darcy, sir,

06:45.960 --> 06:47.960
when our Lizzie
is the sound one here

06:47.960 --> 06:48.960
but nobody cares about her?

06:48.960 --> 06:50.960
Do you not care about women, sir?
Your wife left you

06:50.960 --> 06:53.960
and now you hate women, sir?
I'm not married or have been.

06:53.960 --> 06:56.960
You're about 40
and never been married?

06:56.960 --> 06:57.960
It's a bit dodgy, that, sir.

06:57.960 --> 07:00.320
Unless you think
you're too good for women, sir?

07:00.320 --> 07:02.960
Think you're all that, do you, sir?
Like all men do.

07:02.960 --> 07:04.960
LAUGHTER

07:04.960 --> 07:06.960
Erm, Con, are you messing?

07:06.960 --> 07:08.000
I tricked you into sending me nudes

07:08.000 --> 07:10.480
cos you thought
I was gonna send you one back.

07:10.480 --> 07:12.960
Even after the 50th nude,
you still didn't click on.

07:12.960 --> 07:13.960
Fifty, though?

07:13.960 --> 07:15.960
Did you not think
this ain't happening?

07:15.960 --> 07:17.960
I thought a fresh angle
might win her over.

07:17.960 --> 07:19.960
And Reece,
you defo think you're all that.

07:19.960 --> 07:21.960
Didn't stop you
from kissing us, though.

07:21.960 --> 07:23.960
I was drunk.
You'd only had one drink, though.

07:23.960 --> 07:25.960
It was two years ago.
You were fitter then.

07:25.960 --> 07:27.960
Paedo, then.

07:27.960 --> 07:28.960
OK, that's... that's enough.

07:28.960 --> 07:31.960
So, Mr Darcy.

07:32.960 --> 07:34.160
Nah, Mum.

07:34.160 --> 07:36.960
Come on, I'll call social services
and tell them you're starving me.

07:36.960 --> 07:39.960
I've already spoken to them.
I told them what you did.

07:39.960 --> 07:41.960
They said to starve
the little fucker.

07:41.960 --> 07:43.960
I've got a plan.

07:43.960 --> 07:46.320
I've agreed with Meachie
to mentor this new kid.

07:46.320 --> 07:48.960
Who the fuck
are they gonna let you mentor?

07:48.960 --> 07:50.960
Him there.

07:50.960 --> 07:53.960
What, him, the lanky one?

07:53.960 --> 07:55.960
Hiya, excuse me, hi.

07:55.960 --> 07:56.960
Yeah, you.

07:56.960 --> 07:58.960
Is our Reece mentoring you?

07:58.960 --> 08:00.960
Er... er...

08:00.960 --> 08:02.960
Oh, has he got a disability?

08:02.960 --> 08:04.960
Is that why you've gotta mentor him?

08:04.960 --> 08:06.960
No, Mum.

08:06.960 --> 08:09.960
Oi, hiya, yeah, hiya.

08:09.960 --> 08:10.960
Are you depressed?!

08:10.960 --> 08:13.320
Is that why you're sat on your own?
LAUGHTER

08:13.320 --> 08:15.960
What's he going red for?

08:15.960 --> 08:17.960
Oi, you wet fart!
I asked you a question!

08:17.960 --> 08:19.960
LAUGHTER

08:19.960 --> 08:23.960
Good luck with mentoring that one.
He's got no fucking manners.

08:23.960 --> 08:26.960
Trust me, it's gonna work.

08:34.960 --> 08:36.960
KNOCK AT WINDOW

08:41.960 --> 08:43.960
HE MOUTHS

08:47.960 --> 08:49.320
What the hell are you doing here?

08:49.320 --> 08:51.960
I'm just helping you settle in.
I don't need any help settling in.

08:51.960 --> 08:53.960
KNOCK AT DOOR
Christopher?

08:53.960 --> 08:57.960
Some Viennetta, love. We don't
always slum it here, you know.

08:57.960 --> 09:01.960
Oh, sorry, I didn't know
you were entertaining a guest.

09:01.960 --> 09:04.960
I'll leave you two, to er,
get to know each other.

09:05.960 --> 09:07.160
Why did you take your shirt off?

09:07.160 --> 09:10.960
Thought it'd be funny to make her
think we're shagging. Christopher?

09:10.960 --> 09:12.960
Would you like some juice?

09:12.960 --> 09:15.960
Sorry, Pat, it's just
Chrissy keeps insisting

09:15.960 --> 09:17.960
I'll be more comfortable
if I take my trousers off.

09:17.960 --> 09:19.960
I don't get it. I'm not hot.

09:19.960 --> 09:21.960
I didn't ask him to... We're not...

09:21.960 --> 09:23.960
Chrissy, it's OK.
Don't be embarrassed.

09:23.960 --> 09:28.960
"The truth shall set you free."
The Bible.

09:28.960 --> 09:30.960
You should say the part
of the Bible,

09:30.960 --> 09:32.960
like "Matthew 8." Not just...
"The Bible."

09:32.960 --> 09:33.960
That's a bit racist, that.

09:33.960 --> 09:35.960
Christopher.
Sorry!

09:35.960 --> 09:40.960
I'll go get you both some juice.
Give you more time to... you know.

09:40.960 --> 09:43.960
CHRISTOPHER GROANS
What are you doing here, then?

09:43.960 --> 09:46.640
Is that Secret Millionaire show
coming back for the posh kids?

09:46.640 --> 09:48.960
Oh, well, if you must know,
my mum died

09:48.960 --> 09:50.960
and now I have to live here
with my grandma.

09:56.960 --> 09:58.960
Who calls them "grandma"?

09:58.960 --> 10:02.160
"Ooh, Grandma,
what big ears you have."

10:03.960 --> 10:06.960
Nah, but yeah, lad,
soz about your ma.

10:06.960 --> 10:09.000
People always say they never think
it'll happen to you,

10:09.000 --> 10:11.960
but I think you do know
it can happen to you.

10:11.960 --> 10:13.960
But you can't live your whole life
being worried.

10:13.960 --> 10:15.640
Do you know what I mean?

10:17.960 --> 10:20.480
You need to get out
of this shitty room, lad.

10:20.480 --> 10:21.960
I bet you haven't even been
to Sweet Corner

10:21.960 --> 10:24.960
and smashed in
the pineapple and toffee cubes.

10:24.960 --> 10:26.800
Are they a part of your five a day?

10:26.800 --> 10:27.960
What do you watch on YouTube, lad?

10:27.960 --> 10:30.960
Posh prick reacts
to crushed avocado on toast?

10:30.960 --> 10:31.960
What do you watch, huh?

10:31.960 --> 10:34.640
Lazy chav reacts
to lack of life opportunities?

10:34.640 --> 10:38.960
BOTH STRAINING
AND GRUNTING

10:38.960 --> 10:40.960
Just put it in there, Chrissy!

10:44.640 --> 10:46.960
Hey, Reece.

10:46.960 --> 10:50.960
Lad... just seen
this new caretaker outside, yeah?

10:50.960 --> 10:53.960
And I know your ma says
your da done a runner,

10:53.960 --> 10:55.960
but he's got a massive snoz

10:55.960 --> 10:57.480
and he walks like he's got
a tiny cock.

10:58.960 --> 11:01.960
You should ask him for a DNA test.
LAUGHTER

11:01.960 --> 11:02.960
Do you get it?

11:02.960 --> 11:04.960
LAUGHTER

11:04.960 --> 11:07.960
He's a knob, that little...

11:07.960 --> 11:10.960
He's got too much tos-testerone.

11:10.960 --> 11:12.960
That's why he's always kicking off,

11:12.960 --> 11:15.320
and why he needs to have a wank
seven times a day.

11:15.320 --> 11:16.960
You what?

11:16.960 --> 11:19.960
He has to wank seven times a day,
just to function.

11:19.960 --> 11:21.480
Seven?
Swear.

11:21.480 --> 11:23.960
And you know that gay lad
in the sixth form, what's his name?

11:23.960 --> 11:26.480
Thomas.
He told me that Lewis was bragging

11:26.480 --> 11:27.960
about Aimee giving him her knickers

11:27.960 --> 11:29.960
because he needed them
for his big lunchtime wank,

11:29.960 --> 11:32.160
to get himself through the day.

11:32.160 --> 11:33.640
HE GASPS

11:33.640 --> 11:36.960
And there, lads,
is the drop-off in action.

11:36.960 --> 11:38.800
Oh, my God!

11:38.800 --> 11:39.960
Eee!

11:39.960 --> 11:41.960
Vile.
The dirty bastard.

11:41.960 --> 11:43.960
I mean, it's good he's having
an open dialogue

11:43.960 --> 11:45.960
about his sexual needs.

11:45.960 --> 11:47.960
It's important we encourage
the greater communication.

11:47.960 --> 11:50.960
But at the same time,
just stop wanking.

11:50.960 --> 11:54.160
But that's why I like talking about
me head being in your ma's arse.

11:54.160 --> 11:55.960
I'm all about open dialogue.

11:55.960 --> 11:56.960
Lad, I honestly don't think

11:56.960 --> 11:58.960
your head's going anywhere near
his ma's arse.

11:58.960 --> 12:00.960
All right, well, I have a plan B.

12:00.960 --> 12:01.960
Go 'ead.

12:01.960 --> 12:04.800
If I can't bury it in her arse,
I'll bury it in her tits.

12:04.800 --> 12:06.960
LAUGHTER
You're bad.

12:06.960 --> 12:08.960
BEEP

12:12.960 --> 12:14.960
BEEP

12:15.960 --> 12:17.960
HE SIGHS

12:26.960 --> 12:29.960
LAUGHTER FROM OUTSIDE

12:29.960 --> 12:31.960
Bow!

12:31.960 --> 12:34.960
Oh, my God.
What's your pronouns, girl?

12:34.960 --> 12:38.960
Oh, her pronouns are "as if",
"no chance" and "not interested".

12:38.960 --> 12:40.960
And we'll tell her yours -

12:40.960 --> 12:43.960
"disgusting little perverted rat".

12:43.960 --> 12:45.960
They're conjunctions and verbs, mate.

12:45.960 --> 12:48.960
And you should respect
that I identify

12:48.960 --> 12:52.960
as a disgusting little
perverted rat.

12:52.960 --> 12:55.960
And the DLPR community
strives for equality.

12:57.640 --> 12:58.960
Eurgh!

13:08.320 --> 13:10.000
Another tough one?
Hmm.

13:15.960 --> 13:18.960
Adam Costello's.
Yeah, how'd you get that?

13:18.960 --> 13:20.960
I'm good with people's eyes, girl.

13:20.960 --> 13:23.000
And there's something about his
that screams "vile racist".

13:23.000 --> 13:24.960
Mm.

13:26.960 --> 13:29.800
Must take you a while to, like,
go back and find them.

13:29.800 --> 13:32.960
Oh, yeah. I mean, this one
was from when he was about 13.

13:32.960 --> 13:34.640
I had to go back, like, three years.

13:34.640 --> 13:35.960
Do you know what?
It was worth it, though,

13:35.960 --> 13:39.960
when I blackmailed him
into getting me these.

13:39.960 --> 13:42.960
LAUGHTER, TEXT ALERT

13:42.960 --> 13:44.960
Oh, Chantal's sent
a new dick pic in the group.

13:44.960 --> 13:46.960
Let's see. I'm on form today
with my guesses, me.

13:46.960 --> 13:49.960
Eee, that looks like a traffic cone!

13:49.960 --> 13:52.960
That's Lewis's.

13:52.960 --> 13:55.960
The little rat!
Aw, Aims.

13:55.960 --> 13:58.960
I mean, maybe he could get it,
like, flattened out or something?

13:58.960 --> 14:01.960
Traffic-cone-cock cheating bastard.

14:09.960 --> 14:12.960
So, yesterday's poetry homework.

14:12.960 --> 14:14.960
Who wants to read theirs?

14:15.960 --> 14:17.960
No.

14:17.960 --> 14:21.960
Well, someone needs to reads theirs
so I'm doing my job.

14:21.960 --> 14:24.960
New boy.

14:24.960 --> 14:26.480
Er, I didn't know
we would read it out.

14:26.480 --> 14:28.960
And I didn't know teaching
would be so damn tiring.

14:28.960 --> 14:30.960
Read.

14:30.960 --> 14:34.320
MO IMITATES FART,
LAUGHTER

14:34.320 --> 14:36.960
The sky is full of faces now

14:38.800 --> 14:40.960
Your face

14:40.960 --> 14:44.960
Laughing, crying, scared...

14:46.000 --> 14:48.960
...happy.
MUFFLED LAUGHTER

14:48.960 --> 14:51.960
The face I love and miss the most...
MUFFLED LAUGHTER

14:53.480 --> 14:54.960
Is he starting to cry?

14:54.960 --> 14:56.960
But how do I say...

14:56.960 --> 14:58.960
I wanna read mine, sir.

14:58.960 --> 15:01.800
Er...
It's, er, it's called...

15:02.960 --> 15:03.960
...The Door.

15:04.960 --> 15:06.960
The door

15:08.480 --> 15:09.960
Let me in

15:09.960 --> 15:11.960
Who's in there?

15:11.960 --> 15:13.960
It's Brexit

15:14.960 --> 15:18.320
Was I right? Was I wrong?

15:18.320 --> 15:19.960
Am I now forgotten?

15:21.960 --> 15:26.960
Brexit, Brexit, Universal Credit

15:28.320 --> 15:30.960
Don't get angry, get evil.

15:30.960 --> 15:31.960
Cheers.

15:34.480 --> 15:37.960
Go 'ead, lad.
Heavy poetry, that, you know.

15:37.960 --> 15:39.960
OK, but where was the imagery
and alliteration

15:39.960 --> 15:41.960
that was the point of the task?

15:41.960 --> 15:44.960
I don't know, sir. Brexit took them.
LAUGHTER

15:48.960 --> 15:50.800
Was that about your dog?

15:50.800 --> 15:53.960
I lost my hamster, Angelica,
last year.

15:53.960 --> 15:55.960
Dark times.

15:55.960 --> 15:57.480
He's a vile creature, anyway,
that Mr Dunn.

15:57.480 --> 16:00.320
He once made me read out
my essay about my dreams,

16:00.320 --> 16:03.960
and well, my dream is to be
the first person from Merseyside

16:03.960 --> 16:06.960
to win an Oscar
since Glenda Jackson in 1973.

16:06.960 --> 16:09.800
And I swear, he started laughing.

16:09.800 --> 16:11.960
Well, remember that you're
the captain of your soul.

16:11.960 --> 16:14.960
You what?
It's a quote from Nelson Mandela.

16:14.960 --> 16:16.960
It means you're in the driver's seat
of your life.

16:16.960 --> 16:17.960
Don't listen to others.

16:17.960 --> 16:19.960
Who's Nelson Mandela?

16:26.960 --> 16:28.960
I'm only messing. I know who he is.

16:28.960 --> 16:30.960
I know you probably came
from some fancy school

16:30.960 --> 16:32.640
with your whiteboards and that,

16:32.640 --> 16:34.960
but we do get taught stuff
at this school too, you know.

16:34.960 --> 16:35.960
Is that Uncle Ben, the rice fella?

16:35.960 --> 16:39.160
That's Nelson Mandela,
the first South African President,

16:39.160 --> 16:41.960
beacon of social justice
and democracy.

16:41.960 --> 16:42.960
Hey, they're my bird's.

16:42.960 --> 16:44.800
He dismantled apartheid.

16:44.800 --> 16:45.960
Not a clue.

16:45.960 --> 16:47.960
Reece - toilet, now!
I need your help.

16:47.960 --> 16:50.960
The memories of our kiss
come flooding back now, yeah?

16:50.960 --> 16:54.960
Your foo-foo's hungry.
I've got the "Reece-ipe".

16:54.960 --> 16:55.960
LAUGHTER

16:55.960 --> 16:57.800
Shut your gob,
or I'll change my mind.

16:58.960 --> 17:01.960
Go 'ead, Reece!
Go and get her, lad!

17:03.960 --> 17:05.960
Reece.

17:05.960 --> 17:06.960
You went to Sweet Corner?

17:06.960 --> 17:08.960
Boss, aren't they?
Better than boss.

17:08.960 --> 17:10.960
Life-changing.

17:10.960 --> 17:12.960
In fact, you've changed my life.

17:14.960 --> 17:16.480
I've been lonely here.

17:16.480 --> 17:17.960
But you make me smile.

17:17.960 --> 17:20.160
You give me hope.

17:20.160 --> 17:22.800
Nobody's seen me
since I've been here.

17:22.800 --> 17:27.960
But you, Reece... you see me.

17:27.960 --> 17:31.960
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Are you off your head?

17:31.960 --> 17:33.960
But I thought the stuff
in the bedroom was...?

17:34.960 --> 17:38.000
LAUGHTER

17:38.000 --> 17:40.960
Not bad, that, lad. Not bad.

17:51.960 --> 17:52.960
Good, good.

17:55.000 --> 17:56.960
OK.

18:07.960 --> 18:09.960
HE GROANS

18:09.960 --> 18:11.640
Ladies.

18:13.960 --> 18:16.960
Are you looking for your mentor?

18:16.960 --> 18:18.960
Reece Duffy?

18:18.960 --> 18:20.960
The whole school heard it
in the canteen.

18:20.960 --> 18:24.480
Oh, yeah - stupid, isn't it?
Him as my mentor?

18:24.480 --> 18:26.960
No, no, I'm looking for a book, actually.

18:26.960 --> 18:29.960
It's called, erm, Social Equality...

18:29.960 --> 18:32.960
Social Equality: The Prospects
Of Tomorrow by Florian Schuppert?

18:32.960 --> 18:35.960
Yeah, that's the one, Schuppert.

18:35.960 --> 18:36.960
Hm.

18:40.960 --> 18:42.960
Sorry, it turns out Reece Duffy

18:42.960 --> 18:44.960
actually took
that book out yesterday.

18:44.960 --> 18:46.960
Oh, damn it.

18:46.960 --> 18:49.960
He's probably got the whole
political sociology section on hold.

18:49.960 --> 18:51.160
THEY LAUGH

18:51.160 --> 18:54.000
I heard him and his cronies,
saying things to you.

18:54.000 --> 18:56.320
I mean, they're gonna have
to grow up one day.

18:56.320 --> 18:58.960
Although, can you imagine them
having an actual job

18:58.960 --> 18:59.960
that contributes to society?

18:59.960 --> 19:01.320
Exactly.

19:01.320 --> 19:03.960
A cleaning job, maybe.
You know his mum's a dinner lady?

19:03.960 --> 19:06.960
It makes perfect sense.
What else would she do?

19:06.960 --> 19:08.960
"Erm, please give
our Reece a job!

19:08.960 --> 19:11.960
"Yeah, he'll steal all your laptops,
but he's a good lad, honestly."

19:11.960 --> 19:13.960
No, I didn't mean it like that.

19:13.960 --> 19:16.480
My mum was a dinner lady.

19:16.480 --> 19:22.960
Take your privileged white male
micro aggressive attitude elsewhere.

19:22.960 --> 19:25.000
Schuppert would be disgusted.

19:27.960 --> 19:29.960
KNOCKING

19:30.960 --> 19:31.960
Yeah?

19:31.960 --> 19:33.960
Can I quickly use your bog, Pat?

19:33.960 --> 19:36.960
I've come home for my lunch
and I forgot my key.

19:36.960 --> 19:38.960
It's in there.

19:54.960 --> 19:57.960
Yeah, very funny
Let's bum, whoo!

19:57.960 --> 20:00.960
Oh, Grandma, I'm bumming Reece
to death, because I'm so gay!

20:00.960 --> 20:01.960
Ho-ho-ho

20:01.960 --> 20:03.960
Grow up.
SQUELCH

20:05.800 --> 20:06.960
What the hell's that?

20:06.960 --> 20:09.960
You're disgusting!
What's your problem? I thought...

20:09.960 --> 20:11.960
You thought what?
We were gonna play PlayStation?

20:11.960 --> 20:13.960
Suck each other's nutsacks?

20:13.960 --> 20:16.960
You don't wanna be mates with me,
lad. My ma's only a dinner lady,

20:16.960 --> 20:18.960
and who knows what job
I'll end up doing, eh?

20:25.640 --> 20:27.960
VOICEMAIL ALERT

20:27.960 --> 20:29.960
'Cheer up, mate.

20:29.960 --> 20:31.960
'You're acting like
your mum's just died

20:31.960 --> 20:33.960
'and someone's shat
on your bedroom floor.

20:33.960 --> 20:35.960
'Seriously, I can see why
you need to leave.

20:35.960 --> 20:37.960
'My mum says you can stay with us
as long as you want

20:37.960 --> 20:39.640
'as long as we don't stay up
gaming all night.

20:39.640 --> 20:41.960
'But I told her you're normally dead
within five minutes,

20:41.960 --> 20:43.960
'so it'll be fine.
See you later, mate.'

20:43.960 --> 20:45.800
BEEP

20:58.960 --> 21:00.000
I've waited long enough, Reece.

21:00.000 --> 21:03.960
I'm afraid you're about to be...
Sorry I'm late, sir.

21:03.960 --> 21:08.960
Now then, Christopher,
what I'd like to know is...

21:08.960 --> 21:10.960
has Reece helped you this week?

21:11.960 --> 21:13.960
Not really.

21:13.960 --> 21:15.960
He threatened to paste me.

21:15.960 --> 21:18.960
He pretended to have sex with me
in front of my grandma

21:18.960 --> 21:21.320
and he finished the week
with the piece de resistance

21:21.320 --> 21:22.960
of defecating on my bedroom floor.

21:25.800 --> 21:27.960
But he only did that to me
because I did something to him

21:27.960 --> 21:30.960
which was wrong, and I'm sorry.

21:32.480 --> 21:33.960
He's actually been trying to help.

21:33.960 --> 21:36.640
Told me how I need
to get out of my room,

21:36.640 --> 21:38.960
embrace my new life here.

21:38.960 --> 21:41.960
But with what happened to my mum,
the motivation...

21:43.000 --> 21:44.960
...it's hard.

21:48.960 --> 21:50.960
Looks like you've done well here.

21:50.960 --> 21:53.960
Stay of execution.

21:53.960 --> 21:55.960
Great work, Reece.

21:55.960 --> 21:57.960
I mean, it won't bring his mum back
from the dead,

21:57.960 --> 21:59.960
but it's a step
in the right direction.

21:59.960 --> 22:01.960
Thanks, sir.

22:01.960 --> 22:03.480
Close the door on the way out.

22:03.480 --> 22:06.960
Mum, I'm staying. It worked!

22:06.960 --> 22:09.960
'Oh, get in, son!
I knew you had it in you.

22:09.960 --> 22:12.960
'Now, do me a favour,
don't mess the rest of the year up.

22:12.960 --> 22:14.960
'Maybe that posh bell end
is having a good influence

22:14.960 --> 22:16.960
'on you after all.'

22:16.960 --> 22:18.960
Let's not get carried away, Mum.

22:18.960 --> 22:20.960
Oh, what's for tea later?

22:23.960 --> 22:25.960
Nice one.

22:25.960 --> 22:27.960
Girls look hot in boxies.

22:27.960 --> 22:29.960
Like, when you wear a footie shirt.

22:30.960 --> 22:32.960
I'm into it, me.
Aw.

22:34.960 --> 22:36.960
It's a shame these aren't mine, then.

22:36.960 --> 22:38.960
You what?
Aw, there they are.

22:38.960 --> 22:40.960
I've been looking for them.
I wore these last night.

22:40.960 --> 22:42.960
Very hot night.

22:42.960 --> 22:44.960
Let rip a fair few times, like,

22:44.960 --> 22:47.960
but shame I ain't got a dad
to buy me a new pair, eh?

22:47.960 --> 22:49.960
LAUGHTER
What d'you do that for?

22:49.960 --> 22:51.800
You deserve it.

22:51.800 --> 22:54.960
I was only giving you the knickers
cos I felt sorry for you.

22:54.960 --> 22:57.960
Why can't you use your imagination
to wank, like girls do?

22:57.960 --> 23:00.000
Eh? What's wrong with youse all?

23:00.000 --> 23:02.960
Why do youse always need
something pervy to look at,

23:02.960 --> 23:03.960
like knickers or nudes?

23:03.960 --> 23:07.640
And while I'm here,
why d'youse all love feet?

23:07.640 --> 23:08.960
You freaks.

23:08.960 --> 23:10.160
Feet-licker!

23:10.160 --> 23:11.960
You're on one, you!

23:11.960 --> 23:13.960
Yeah, I'm on one,
because I can't trust you.

23:13.960 --> 23:15.960
I'm one on
cos I'm sick of being nice

23:15.960 --> 23:17.320
and getting nothing back.

23:17.320 --> 23:18.960
I'm fed up for not being me.

23:18.960 --> 23:21.320
We're done!
LAUGHTER

23:21.320 --> 23:22.960
Good for you, queen.

23:23.960 --> 23:25.960
Because I'm the captain of my soul.

23:25.960 --> 23:27.960
Oh!

23:29.960 --> 23:31.960
That's from him, that, innit?

23:31.960 --> 23:32.960
That posh nonce!

23:32.960 --> 23:36.960
Talks like he's got
Benedict Cucumber up his arse!

23:36.960 --> 23:38.960
Somebody needs another wank.

23:38.960 --> 23:40.960
And you - argh!
Oh, my God!

23:42.960 --> 23:44.960
Lewis! Lewis!

23:46.320 --> 23:48.960
You never learn, do you, Lewis?

23:48.960 --> 23:50.960
Well, that's another suspension
with immediate effect.

23:50.960 --> 23:52.960
LAUGHTER

23:52.960 --> 23:56.960
♪ Cheerio, cheerio, cheerio. ♪

23:56.960 --> 23:57.960
Listen...

23:57.960 --> 24:00.960
you even speak to my bird
when I'm gone, lad,

24:00.960 --> 24:02.960
and you're dead. Watch!

24:05.800 --> 24:07.960
OK, fun's over. Go home.

24:07.960 --> 24:08.960
Go on!

24:14.960 --> 24:16.960
These boxers are a bit tight,
aren't they, lad?

24:16.960 --> 24:18.960
I like my nut sack to feel
like it's being held.

24:18.960 --> 24:19.960
CONNOR LAUGHS
Come 'ead.

24:19.960 --> 24:21.960
Ow!

24:24.160 --> 24:26.960
'Roderick said
you're not coming back now.'

24:26.960 --> 24:29.800
'Liverpool's grabbed him
by the bollocks already.'

24:29.800 --> 24:32.960
I wouldn't go quite that far.
It's a... mum thing.

24:32.960 --> 24:34.960
TEXT ALERT

24:39.960 --> 24:41.960
'Relax, son.

24:41.960 --> 24:45.480
'I've set this email for you
to receive after I've gone.

24:46.960 --> 24:49.960
'But if I'm still alive and still
fighting this cancer prick,

24:49.960 --> 24:52.960
'then yay to me.

24:52.960 --> 24:55.960
'Although, then,
this would be kind of awkward,

24:55.960 --> 24:58.960
'and you know how much
I hate awkwardness,

24:58.960 --> 25:00.960
'so let's hope I'm gone.'

25:00.960 --> 25:01.960
HE LAUGHS

25:01.960 --> 25:04.320
'I know you weren't keen
on living with your grandma.

25:04.320 --> 25:05.960
'But you realise what family means

25:05.960 --> 25:07.960
'when you know
you won't be around forever.

25:07.960 --> 25:11.960
'I still feel guilty
for moving away from your grandma

25:11.960 --> 25:15.640
'all those years ago,
and this'll mean so much to her.

25:15.640 --> 25:17.480
'It means so much to me.

25:17.480 --> 25:20.960
'I wasn't there for your grandma,
but you can be.

25:21.960 --> 25:23.960
'Keep doing me proud, son.

25:24.960 --> 25:26.960
'I love you.'

25:26.960 --> 25:28.800
HE SNIFFS

25:36.320 --> 25:38.960
'Say no more.
Mums are mums.'

25:38.960 --> 25:41.960
'Yeah, big up
to all the mums out there.'

25:41.960 --> 25:44.960
I'll fuck all your mums,
you little mings!
