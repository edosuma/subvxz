00:22.981 --> 00:27.360
<i>What is it that haunts you?</i>

00:28.903 --> 00:34.367
<i>Whose eyes peer at you from the dark?</i>

01:02.270 --> 01:03.605
Hmm…

01:31.049 --> 01:33.968
<i>I love you, Jin.</i>

01:39.265 --> 01:40.100
No.

01:45.605 --> 01:48.108
You must… must be…

01:52.278 --> 01:53.113
Jin.

03:10.565 --> 03:11.900
Jin needs our help!

03:12.483 --> 03:13.401
Come on!

03:13.985 --> 03:14.819
No.

03:15.612 --> 03:19.073
This must be Jin's fight and Jin's alone.

03:19.157 --> 03:22.869
You can't be serious, Heihachi.
He needs--

03:22.952 --> 03:26.456
We will not interfere.

03:41.804 --> 03:45.016
You're gonna pay, demon.

03:47.060 --> 03:49.604
You will find
nothing here is given.

03:50.104 --> 03:53.524
Everything that will come to you
must be earned.

03:54.108 --> 03:59.989
You will pay in sweat
and sometimes… in blood.

04:03.576 --> 04:06.204
The moment you step into that ring,

04:06.829 --> 04:09.374
you're not to turn your back on anyone,

04:10.166 --> 04:12.001
not even me.

04:12.919 --> 04:18.174
Teacher, student, friend, lover.

04:18.800 --> 04:21.761
In the ring, none of that matters.

04:40.113 --> 04:41.990
The last time we fought,

04:43.241 --> 04:45.410
you were attacking a child.

04:45.910 --> 04:50.081
Not so easy now, huh, Ogre?

04:59.048 --> 05:01.718
-He's getting killed out there!
-No!

05:01.801 --> 05:07.724
This is Jin's fight to win or to lose.

05:14.772 --> 05:18.109
Always focus
on the immediate moment.

05:18.609 --> 05:20.028
Not your day before,

05:20.528 --> 05:22.822
not the outcome you want later.

05:24.282 --> 05:27.577
But… you hesitated.

05:27.660 --> 05:29.871
I know. It's just--

05:29.954 --> 05:32.040
Hesitation is a weakness

05:32.623 --> 05:35.710
and most likely what killed your mother.

05:35.793 --> 05:40.298
You will never beat Ogre with… hesitation.

05:42.050 --> 05:44.010
<i>In order to defeat him,</i>

05:44.719 --> 05:47.805
<i>you must purge the Kazama pacifism</i>

05:49.557 --> 05:51.726
<i>and stoke your Mishima fire.</i>

06:03.404 --> 06:07.325
The only thing that should exist
is the technique, the form.

06:08.951 --> 06:10.953
When you have mastered the moment,

06:11.954 --> 06:15.124
then, and only then,
can you start moving ahead.

06:17.627 --> 06:20.546
<i>You must not only fight him</i>
<i>as Mishima</i>

06:21.130 --> 06:23.424
<i>but also win as Mishima.</i>

06:57.166 --> 06:59.794
I want this thing contained immediately.

07:00.294 --> 07:02.046
Call Bosconovitch.

07:02.130 --> 07:03.464
Don't bother.

07:03.548 --> 07:04.507
What?

07:05.383 --> 07:06.634
He's dead.

07:09.804 --> 07:12.765
And I'm… finished.

07:13.850 --> 07:17.478
I don't want anything to do
with you or your tournament.

07:18.438 --> 07:20.398
If it were not for me…

07:21.566 --> 07:24.235
My mother would still be alive.

07:26.404 --> 07:29.824
Other good people would still be alive!

07:52.847 --> 07:54.765
-Look out!

08:48.319 --> 08:52.323
I'm gonna send you back to hell, demon.

09:02.667 --> 09:04.710
Hey, you ugly bastard!

09:13.886 --> 09:14.887
Jin!

09:49.130 --> 09:50.506
Just you and me, huh?

09:53.426 --> 09:54.343
Great.

10:10.526 --> 10:11.360
No.

10:12.570 --> 10:15.448
Can't… let him do this.

10:19.785 --> 10:22.830
Sometimes life calls for defense,

10:23.497 --> 10:25.583
sometimes for offense.

10:26.167 --> 10:30.379
Promise me you'll always know
when to use which.

10:43.476 --> 10:44.310
No.

10:51.275 --> 10:52.109
No.

10:52.193 --> 10:54.487
When the pain is too much,

10:55.112 --> 10:58.366
or you're too weak
to get back on your feet,

10:59.158 --> 11:03.621
think of your helplessness
when Ogre killed your mother,

11:04.205 --> 11:07.583
and let the anger
that comes with that memory

11:07.667 --> 11:10.628
lift you back up.

11:12.755 --> 11:13.881
Remember, dear,

11:13.964 --> 11:17.551
the first opponent you must defeat
in any fight is yourself.

11:18.427 --> 11:20.638
You must conquer your thoughts.

11:21.931 --> 11:22.765
No.

11:23.974 --> 11:26.268
The most important thing I can teach you

11:26.352 --> 11:30.648
is to control your anger and use
whatever power you have for good.

11:30.731 --> 11:32.608
You have a gift.

11:34.110 --> 11:35.736
You are a Kazama,

11:35.820 --> 11:39.532
and it's important to me
that you use that gift for good.

11:40.116 --> 11:42.201
In order to defeat him,

11:42.785 --> 11:45.705
you must purge the Kazama pacifism

11:46.247 --> 11:48.749
and stoke your Mishima fire.

12:08.978 --> 12:15.484
You end here and now.

12:21.282 --> 12:22.158
Jin.

12:29.415 --> 12:32.251
The Devil Gene.

12:54.648 --> 12:56.984
You're gonna have to do better than that.

14:35.499 --> 14:37.835
I guess you really did earn

14:37.918 --> 14:41.213
the, uh, King of Iron Fist title

14:41.714 --> 14:42.798
this year.

14:42.882 --> 14:45.175
Way to go, tough guy.

14:45.718 --> 14:48.679
Yeah. Good job, kid.

14:48.762 --> 14:50.014
You did it, Jin.

14:51.015 --> 14:53.100
I know your mother would be proud.

14:56.270 --> 15:02.234
You have avenged Jun Kazama.

15:03.277 --> 15:07.197
And indeed you carry the same curse

15:07.781 --> 15:10.367
as Kazuya Mishima.

15:10.868 --> 15:14.496
Curse?
Or the same power, Heihachi?

15:15.122 --> 15:19.209
Like father, like son.

15:19.793 --> 15:22.004
I'm nothing like him,

15:22.588 --> 15:24.256
or like you.

15:25.507 --> 15:27.009
Indeed.

15:30.095 --> 15:32.514
I am Mishima,

15:32.598 --> 15:37.519
and you are an abomination.

15:50.282 --> 15:51.283
Jin!

15:54.119 --> 15:56.830
Heihachi, what have you done?

15:57.331 --> 16:03.212
I have rid the world
of a great and powerful evil.

16:07.132 --> 16:09.301
You're the evil one.

16:10.511 --> 16:12.471
You're worse than Kazuya.

16:13.597 --> 16:14.556
Perhaps.

16:15.975 --> 16:19.019
But I'm also the only one strong enough

16:19.103 --> 16:24.233
to protect this world from the Devil Gene.

16:25.484 --> 16:26.318
<i>Jin.</i>

16:27.820 --> 16:30.072
The most important thing I can teach you

16:30.155 --> 16:34.159
is to control your anger and use
whatever power you have for good.

16:57.433 --> 16:58.350
Huh…

17:20.622 --> 17:21.457
Mom.

17:25.127 --> 17:27.129
I'm sorry, Mother.

17:58.619 --> 17:59.912
Jin, no!

17:59.995 --> 18:01.872
-Jin, stop!

18:07.711 --> 18:10.339
A true Mishima…

18:11.673 --> 18:15.260
…would end this here.

18:38.951 --> 18:39.785
Jin…
