WEBVTT

03:10.482 --> 03:12.109
I want more!

03:12.275 --> 03:13.697
Oh, God.

03:25.288 --> 03:26.289
Are you okay?

03:30.335 --> 03:33.305
That was fucking charming,
you gutless pack of dickheads.

03:33.463 --> 03:35.807
- Fuck off, you talent-less dog!
- What was that?

03:35.966 --> 03:38.219
- Show us your pink bits.
- No, I don't think I will.

03:38.385 --> 03:40.183
Now, do you know why
this microphone has such a long cord?

03:40.345 --> 03:41.345
Why?

03:41.471 --> 03:44.145
So it's easily retrieved
after I've shoved it up your ass.

03:53.024 --> 03:54.901
Christ Almighty!

03:56.403 --> 03:58.497
What the fuck's going on
out there tonight?

04:00.240 --> 04:01.617
Are you hurt?

04:02.784 --> 04:06.209
All right, which one of you bitches
sat on my dress?

04:06.371 --> 04:07.998
Tick, darling, it's for you.

04:09.499 --> 04:11.001
- Hello.
- Ding-dong.

04:11.168 --> 04:14.138
Avon calling. Howdy, sunshine.

04:14.296 --> 04:16.094
Long time no hear.

04:17.173 --> 04:19.427
- Where?
- Emergency Ward A.

04:23.096 --> 04:24.439
Mr. Belrose?

04:25.932 --> 04:26.933
Yes?

04:29.686 --> 04:32.064
So how about it?

04:57.339 --> 04:58.465
Yeah.

04:58.632 --> 05:03.388
Bernadette? it's Tick.
Sorry to call you so late, but...

05:05.055 --> 05:06.773
Hey, are you okay?

05:07.474 --> 05:10.444
- No, I'm not.
- Well, what's the matter?

05:11.978 --> 05:13.321
Trumpet just died.

05:24.407 --> 05:27.411
"The Lord is my shepherd.
I shall not want.

05:27.911 --> 05:30.539
"He maketh me to lie down
in green pastures.

05:30.705 --> 05:33.379
"He leadeth me beside the still waters.

05:33.542 --> 05:35.169
"He restoreth my soul.

05:35.335 --> 05:39.215
"He leadeth me in the paths
of righteousness for his name's sake.

05:39.381 --> 05:42.260
"Yea, though I walk through
the valley of the shadow of death,

05:42.425 --> 05:45.304
â€œl will fear no evil,
for thou art with me.

05:45.470 --> 05:47.768
"Thy rod and thy staff,
they comfort me.

05:48.265 --> 05:52.270
"Thou preparest a table before me
in the presence of mine enemies.

05:52.435 --> 05:54.108
"Thou anointest my head with oil.

05:54.271 --> 05:56.399
"My cup runneth over.

05:56.565 --> 06:00.911
"Surely, goodness and mercy
shall follow me all the days of my life,

06:01.069 --> 06:03.743
"and l will dwell
in the house of the Lord forever."

06:05.657 --> 06:07.125
It's not fair.

06:07.450 --> 06:09.669
I've spent half my life
and all my savings

06:09.828 --> 06:12.422
trying to snag a sympathetic husband.

06:12.581 --> 06:15.255
Selfish little shit goes and dies on me.

06:16.418 --> 06:21.015
Twenty-five years old, and he goes
and slips over in a bathroom.

06:21.172 --> 06:22.765
He didn't slip.

06:23.466 --> 06:27.471
He was peroxiding his hair at home again
and he asphyxiated on the fumes.

06:29.890 --> 06:31.312
I've gotta get some space.

06:32.183 --> 06:34.857
I've been asked to do
a show out of town.

06:35.020 --> 06:37.648
- That's nice.
- Why don't you come with me?

06:37.814 --> 06:41.193
I'll need some help,
and I think we can both use the break.

06:41.359 --> 06:43.657
You're not wrong. Where is it?

06:44.195 --> 06:45.788
Alice Springs.

06:46.531 --> 06:49.034
You've got to be fucking joking!

06:49.993 --> 06:54.715
Wo-Man is a
unique range of...

06:54.873 --> 06:58.753
specialty facial products
designed for the more...

07:00.170 --> 07:02.298
heavy-duty woman in us all.

07:03.131 --> 07:04.849
Now, this week...

07:06.426 --> 07:07.973
Excuse me.

07:09.304 --> 07:10.476
Hello.

07:10.639 --> 07:12.607
How long is the run?

07:13.725 --> 07:16.774
Four weeks.
Equity minimum, two shows a night,

07:16.937 --> 07:18.689
accommodation included.

07:20.690 --> 07:23.364
I can't just sit around here
crying all the time.

07:23.818 --> 07:27.573
Jesus! My mascara keeps running.
I look like a raccoon.

07:27.739 --> 07:30.538
Good girl. That's the spirit.

07:31.618 --> 07:33.962
Here's hoping the desert's big enough
for the two of us.

07:36.414 --> 07:37.711
Three of us.

07:56.017 --> 07:58.395
- Why?
- Why not?

07:59.604 --> 08:02.232
Look, he's turned into
a bloody good little performer.

08:02.399 --> 08:03.491
That's right.

08:03.650 --> 08:07.575
A bloody good little performer,
24 hours a day, seven days a week.

08:07.737 --> 08:09.831
I thought we were getting away
from all this shit.

08:09.990 --> 08:12.584
Two's company, three's a party,
Bernadette, my sweet.

08:13.910 --> 08:17.915
We're unplugging our curling wands
and going bush for this show.

08:18.081 --> 08:20.161
Why would you possibly
want to leave all this glamour

08:20.291 --> 08:22.089
for a hike into the middle of nowhere?

08:22.252 --> 08:24.926
- Do you really want to know?
- Desperately.

08:26.673 --> 08:30.428
Well, ever since I was a lad,
I've had this dream,

08:30.593 --> 08:34.018
a dream that
I now finally have a chance to fulfill.

08:34.179 --> 08:35.773
And that is?

08:36.349 --> 08:40.946
To travel to the center of Australia,
climb Kings Canyon as a queen

08:41.104 --> 08:44.779
in a full-length Gaultier sequin,
heels, and a tiara.

08:46.818 --> 08:50.448
Great. That's just
what this country needs,

08:50.947 --> 08:52.915
a cock in a frock on a rock.

08:53.074 --> 08:55.418
Get back in your kennels, both of you.

08:56.578 --> 08:58.706
The first thing we have to work out

09:00.290 --> 09:01.883
is how the hell we're gonna get there.

09:16.306 --> 09:17.933
Ta-da!

09:18.099 --> 09:19.567
What do you think?

09:19.726 --> 09:22.400
When do we have to
return it to the school?

09:22.562 --> 09:24.439
We don't. We own it.

09:25.690 --> 09:26.690
What?

09:26.775 --> 09:27.992
Hi, darling, how are you?

09:28.151 --> 09:32.531
I met some nice, Swedish tourists
called Lars, Lars, and Lars,

09:32.697 --> 09:35.166
and I coaxed it out of them
for 10,000 bucks.

09:35.325 --> 09:38.044
- We can't afford it.
- That's right.

09:38.828 --> 09:41.877
Mummy, maybe a trip to the Outback
would help me get over

09:42.040 --> 09:44.668
this little phase I'm going through.

09:44.834 --> 09:48.509
And you never know.
I might meet some lovely country girl.

09:49.380 --> 09:52.805
I hereby christen
this budget Barbie camper,

09:53.384 --> 09:55.853
Priscilla, queen of the desert.

09:59.724 --> 10:01.772
Seems to be the
understatement of the century.

10:21.746 --> 10:23.214
Mum.

10:28.253 --> 10:29.550
Ladies and gentlemen,

10:29.712 --> 10:32.886
we're here today to see off
a very brave woman

10:33.049 --> 10:36.053
who will attempt
to cross a continent alone.

10:36.219 --> 10:38.472
On behalf of all our sponsors...

10:54.362 --> 10:56.911
Ladies, start your engines.

11:33.443 --> 11:37.949
Oh, please! Oh, give me a break!

11:55.173 --> 11:57.141
How long have we been on the road?

11:57.967 --> 11:59.685
Four and a half hours.

12:02.263 --> 12:04.140
I've got a splitting headache already.

12:07.018 --> 12:08.019
Happy hour!

12:08.186 --> 12:09.529
Mother's Ruin pour moi.

12:10.438 --> 12:13.567
- Long Island Tea.
- And a Stoli and tonic for me.

12:17.737 --> 12:19.239
- Stupid cow!
- Yeah, well, listen to this one.

12:19.405 --> 12:21.248
After we did the ABBA show,

12:21.407 --> 12:24.035
Kevin had one of those
liposuction penis enlargements.

12:24.202 --> 12:25.454
- He didn't?
- Yep.

12:26.162 --> 12:27.163
Do you know what they do?

12:27.330 --> 12:29.708
They siphon all the fat
out of your love handles

12:29.874 --> 12:31.717
and actually inject it
into your wing-wang.

12:31.876 --> 12:33.093
Yucky!

12:33.711 --> 12:36.751
I suppose it gives a whole new meaning
to cracking a fat, though, doesn't it?

12:39.592 --> 12:41.390
Oh, listen to yourselves.

12:41.844 --> 12:44.518
You sound like two fat slags
at a pie bake-off.

12:45.181 --> 12:49.357
Your contribution to the conversation
hasn't exactly made headlines, Bernice.

12:49.519 --> 12:52.238
Gee, poor Kevin's dick.

12:52.397 --> 12:54.115
There can't be much room down there

12:54.274 --> 12:56.697
with his brain taking up
so much space already.

12:58.653 --> 13:01.497
No, I'll join this conversation
on the proviso

13:01.656 --> 13:03.533
that we stop bitching about people,

13:03.700 --> 13:06.829
talking about wigs, dresses, bust sizes,

13:06.995 --> 13:10.499
penises, drugs, nightclubs,
and bloody ABBA.

13:11.374 --> 13:13.923
Doesn't give us much
to talk about then, does it?

13:15.128 --> 13:20.305
Hey, can you confirm a rumor for me?
Is it true that her real name's Ralph?

13:26.347 --> 13:28.441
How do you like your little boys, girls?

13:32.395 --> 13:34.898
You don't have to answer that
if you don't want to.

13:35.064 --> 13:36.566
Oh, my God.

13:36.733 --> 13:38.986
What is this, Outback with Benny Hill?

13:39.152 --> 13:41.951
Just leave mine outside the door
at about 8:00 a.m.,

13:42.113 --> 13:44.741
along with an orange juice
and toast, please.

13:45.074 --> 13:47.042
Oh, why, certainly, madam.

13:47.201 --> 13:49.750
And would you like
Vegemite or jam with that?

13:54.083 --> 13:56.085
Knock, knock, room service.

13:56.502 --> 13:58.254
Can't you read the sign?
Do Not Disturb.

13:58.421 --> 14:01.721
- Please come back in the morning.
- Ha ha, girls! Open the door.

14:03.009 --> 14:04.261
Good night, Bernice.

14:04.802 --> 14:06.850
Good night, Mitzi.

14:07.305 --> 14:08.932
Open the fucking door!

14:12.435 --> 14:16.440
Okay, if you don't open the door,
I'm gonna sing.

14:18.858 --> 14:20.826
Fine. You asked for it.

14:45.968 --> 14:47.390
Good night, John Boy.

14:53.226 --> 14:55.399
I'm seriously falling asleep.

14:55.937 --> 14:58.360
It's your shift,
and you're gonna stick to it.

14:58.523 --> 15:01.242
Serves you right
for staying out all night, slut.

15:01.401 --> 15:02.402
I'm not gonna make it.

15:05.279 --> 15:07.498
Fuck off, Grandma.

15:08.116 --> 15:09.493
You all right?

15:10.159 --> 15:12.503
Me? Yeah, I'm fine. I'm just thinking.

15:45.486 --> 15:48.911
Sorry. Shit!

15:50.158 --> 15:51.375
What is it?

16:07.049 --> 16:08.722
Perhaps we should've flown.

16:26.777 --> 16:29.826
Wrong,
but thanks for playing. Anyone else?

16:29.989 --> 16:32.788
- No.
- Witchetty grub. Your turn.

16:33.034 --> 16:36.504
I spy with my little eye
something beginning with â€œRâ€œ.

16:37.580 --> 16:39.378
- Rectum.
- No.

16:39.665 --> 16:41.542
- Ring pirate?
- No.

16:41.709 --> 16:42.961
Road.

16:43.461 --> 16:45.381
All right, that's it.
What's the matter with you?

16:45.463 --> 16:48.307
- Nothing, darling.
- Don't "darling" me, darling.

16:48.466 --> 16:50.389
Look at you.
You got a face like a cat's ass.

16:50.551 --> 16:51.768
Now, come on, 'fess up.

16:51.928 --> 16:54.306
Just worried about the show, that's all.

16:54.472 --> 16:56.315
We haven't done any rehearsals yet.

16:56.474 --> 16:59.314
We got two weeks, for Christ's sake.
There's plenty of time to rehearse.

16:59.393 --> 17:01.942
- Now what is your problem?
- It's not a problem.

17:02.104 --> 17:04.732
I just want the show
to be good, that's all.

17:04.898 --> 17:05.898
Gotta be good.

17:05.942 --> 17:08.194
How the fuck did you get this job,
Mitzi, my darling?

17:08.361 --> 17:09.487
I mean, who is the fish that runs

17:09.654 --> 17:11.748
this bloody hotel in the
middle of nowhere, anyway?

17:11.906 --> 17:14.579
- Your mother?
- No, my wife.

17:16.702 --> 17:18.742
Don't tell me you've got an
ex-boyfriend tucked away

17:18.788 --> 17:21.086
- out here somewhere.
- No, my wife.

17:22.750 --> 17:23.750
I'm married.

17:34.053 --> 17:39.526
And when the joint bank account ran dry
after a couple of years,

17:41.143 --> 17:44.738
I guess I preferred her wedding ring
to mine, so no drama.

17:44.897 --> 17:47.320
We swapped and called it a day.

17:48.317 --> 17:50.570
This is getting too weird.

17:51.779 --> 17:53.873
You and a woman.

17:55.533 --> 17:57.331
I mean, what did she
used to do for kicks?

17:57.493 --> 17:59.493
Put a bucket on your head
and swing off the handle?

18:01.163 --> 18:05.043
There are two things I don't like
about you, Felicia. Your face.

18:05.209 --> 18:07.758
So how about shutting both of them?

18:07.920 --> 18:10.969
At least this explains
your abysmal batting average, Mitz.

18:11.132 --> 18:13.976
I often wondered
why your dance card was so empty.

18:14.135 --> 18:15.808
I take it you never got a divorce, then?

18:19.015 --> 18:23.566
Well, girls, what can I say?
Here's to a secret very well-kept.

18:23.728 --> 18:26.572
Shame it's not gonna
stay that way, isn't it?

18:28.107 --> 18:30.860
Got any more little surprises
you'd like to share with us?

18:31.027 --> 18:34.031
Haven't got any kids stashed away
out there as well, have you?

18:39.368 --> 18:42.838
Look, I haven't lied about anything.

18:45.166 --> 18:48.466
After six years, I get a phone call
out of nowhere, screaming for help.

18:48.628 --> 18:51.256
Christ knows I owe her
a couple of favors.

18:55.217 --> 18:57.936
I'm sorry that I never told you.

18:59.221 --> 19:01.565
I'm not sorry that you're here.

19:08.648 --> 19:11.492
Don't worry about it, dolls.

19:11.651 --> 19:13.699
I'm as jealous as all hell.

19:24.997 --> 19:26.089
What?

19:26.916 --> 19:31.467
So was it a big wedding?
Get lots of prezzies, did you?

19:31.629 --> 19:33.882
I just wish I was old enough
to have been there.

19:34.048 --> 19:35.516
Oh, ha-ha.

19:35.675 --> 19:37.803
I would've bought you
a lovely matching set

19:37.968 --> 19:40.016
of hers and hers bathmats or something.

19:40.179 --> 19:43.149
- Oh, give it a rest.
- Not on your life.

19:43.307 --> 19:47.778
Oh, imagine! Mitzi the Magnificent
and her blushing bride.

19:48.979 --> 19:51.528
Mowing those lawns must've been
murder on your heels, though.

19:51.691 --> 19:53.785
All right, Felicia, that's enough.

19:53.943 --> 19:56.947
Let's put some money in that seething,
cesspool mouth of yours.

19:57.113 --> 20:00.117
If I win this game,
you will never mention my wife

20:00.282 --> 20:02.455
ever in my presence again, okay?

20:02.618 --> 20:06.248
- And if I win?
- Name your price.

20:06.414 --> 20:09.543
Well, now, what would I like
more than anything else

20:09.709 --> 20:12.303
in the whole, wide world?

20:12.461 --> 20:14.634
Snap. Better be quick.

20:16.674 --> 20:19.473
(I LOVE THE NIGHT LIFE

20:32.565 --> 20:34.192
What the fuck am I doing?

20:35.025 --> 20:38.450
Take that bloody frock off, Felicia.
Don't make it any worse than it is.

20:38.612 --> 20:41.081
You think I'm gonna let you walk away
with all the attention?

20:41.240 --> 20:44.915
No chance. Come on, girls.
Let's go shopping.

20:45.995 --> 20:48.043
Oh, for Christ's sake.

21:06.807 --> 21:08.184
I just adore these hats.

21:08.350 --> 21:10.523
Come on, come on!

21:29.747 --> 21:32.216
You've got to be kidding.

21:32.708 --> 21:36.303
Welcome to Mario's Palace.
Come in, come in.

21:38.380 --> 21:42.635
Come in. What can I do for you?
Would you like a room, madam?

21:57.316 --> 22:00.661
- Subtle.
- Oh, tack-o-rama.

22:00.820 --> 22:02.660
Who the hell does
all the painting around here?

22:02.738 --> 22:06.117
Someone with no arms or right foot,
by the look of things.

22:06.700 --> 22:10.045
For goodness sakes,
get down off that crucifix.

22:10.204 --> 22:11.672
Someone needs the wood.

22:11.831 --> 22:14.584
What have we here?

22:16.961 --> 22:19.760
What fun. Baby bottles of booze.

22:20.256 --> 22:24.762
Oh. Gather round, girls.
Let me show you a trick.

22:25.135 --> 22:26.808
You drink the gin,

22:33.102 --> 22:36.231
fill the bottle up with water,
and put it back in the fridge.

22:36.397 --> 22:38.240
Va t'en vous.
What about the Scotch?

22:38.399 --> 22:42.279
That's where the complimentary teabags
come in handy.

22:42.444 --> 22:44.822
- Very clever.
- Cheers, girls.

22:44.989 --> 22:47.208
And congratulations, Mitzi, darling.
You did it.

22:47.366 --> 22:50.870
One lap of the Broken Hill
main drag in drag.

22:51.036 --> 22:53.915
That'll teach you to take on
the Fairmont Boys School Snap champion.

22:54.498 --> 22:57.217
Here's to being off that fucking bus.

22:58.627 --> 23:00.504
- Chookers.
- Chookers.

23:03.799 --> 23:07.224
So, all dolled up and nowhere to go.

23:07.386 --> 23:10.481
I sure as shit am not gonna sit
in here all evening.

23:10.639 --> 23:11.640
I'm in.

23:16.186 --> 23:20.066
Oh, all right. Here's hoping
they have a decent cocktail bar.

23:41.003 --> 23:45.759
Hello. Could I please have
a Stoli and tonic,

23:45.925 --> 23:48.895
a Bloody Mary,
and a lime daiquiri, please?

23:49.803 --> 23:55.276
Well, look what
the cat dragged in.

23:57.353 --> 23:59.355
What have we got here, eh?

24:00.105 --> 24:03.029
A couple of showgirls, have we?

24:04.276 --> 24:08.031
Where did you ladies
come in from? Uranus?

24:10.032 --> 24:13.878
- Could I please have a Stoli...
- No! You can't have.

24:14.036 --> 24:15.709
You can't have nothing.

24:15.871 --> 24:18.215
We've got nothing here
for people like you.

24:18.374 --> 24:19.671
Nothing!

24:30.052 --> 24:32.146
Now listen here, you mullet.

24:32.304 --> 24:36.150
Why don't you just light your tampon
and blow your box apart,

24:36.308 --> 24:39.983
because it's the only bang
you're ever gonna get, sweetheart.

25:07.423 --> 25:10.597
Now, what could be more soothing

25:11.260 --> 25:16.767
than coming home after a
hard day's work down the mine

25:17.391 --> 25:20.520
to the Wo-Man in us all?

25:20.686 --> 25:24.111
Now, don't send any money, okay?

26:04.104 --> 26:05.447
Ooh.

26:11.528 --> 26:13.576
Shit!

26:14.573 --> 26:18.578
All I can see is female impersonators.

26:25.292 --> 26:26.760
This has gotta be a first.

26:26.919 --> 26:30.014
Nobody has ever out-drunk
old Shirl before.

26:30.172 --> 26:32.300
Where'd you learn
to throw them back like that?

26:32.466 --> 26:34.218
That's our girl, Bernadette.

26:34.384 --> 26:37.604
I just knew that stumbling around
the pub circuit with Les Girls

26:37.763 --> 26:39.982
for 200 years
must've taught her something.

26:40.390 --> 26:44.020
- You're a bloody marvel, Bernie.
- Bernadette, please.

26:44.186 --> 26:46.689
- What's that?
- My name isn't Bernie.

26:46.855 --> 26:48.528
She said her name isn't Bernie.

26:50.359 --> 26:51.702
It's Ralph!

26:56.365 --> 26:57.617
Come on.

27:03.413 --> 27:06.713
- What did you call me?
- "What did you call me," what?

27:07.209 --> 27:10.053
What did you call me
back there in the bar?

27:10.212 --> 27:11.634
Sorry, Ralph.

27:14.550 --> 27:15.927
You fucking idiot!

27:18.387 --> 27:19.559
FUCK!

27:21.181 --> 27:23.058
Fuck! Get off me, you fucking...

27:23.642 --> 27:24.642
FUCK!

27:25.185 --> 27:27.813
Don't worry about a fucking
thing. It's only my fucking head.

27:27.980 --> 27:30.449
At least the bump on
your head's bigger than your prick.

27:30.607 --> 27:33.076
Why don't you just get fucked,
you stupid old bitch?

27:33.235 --> 27:34.703
Oh, piss off, you little faggot.

27:34.862 --> 27:36.159
You're so bloody boring...

27:36.321 --> 27:38.289
If your mouth was as big as your dick...

27:59.136 --> 28:01.059
- Good morning.
- Morning.

28:03.432 --> 28:05.150
It's funny, you know.

28:06.476 --> 28:09.355
No matter how tough I think I'm getting,

28:12.107 --> 28:13.700
ii Still hurts.

28:17.404 --> 28:20.704
Hope it still works.
Don't have much call for it out here.

28:20.866 --> 28:23.790
- Where you blokes from?
- Uranus.

28:23.952 --> 28:25.295
Oh, good.

28:35.923 --> 28:37.140
There. Left.

28:37.299 --> 28:39.393
I hope you know what you're doing.

28:39.885 --> 28:41.637
If we stick to the sealed road,

28:41.803 --> 28:43.897
we'll be at it for
at least another two days.

28:48.018 --> 28:49.361
Take the shortcut.

29:43.699 --> 29:46.543
One more push,
I'm gonna smack his face so hard,

29:46.702 --> 29:49.376
he'll have to stick his toothbrush
up his ass to clean his teeth.

29:53.208 --> 29:54.881
Just lay off.

29:55.043 --> 29:57.262
I told you not to use the "R" word.

29:57.421 --> 30:00.345
- What did you go and do?
- I was only having a bit of fun.

30:00.507 --> 30:03.727
Fun? What else do you do for amusement,
slam your fingers in car doors?

30:04.011 --> 30:05.263
What's the point?

30:05.429 --> 30:08.399
I like seeing people get hotheaded,
okay? It gives me a kick.

30:08.557 --> 30:09.757
Is it true when you were born,

30:09.891 --> 30:11.859
the doctor turned around
and slapped your mother?

30:13.645 --> 30:16.945
What sort of bent childhood did
you have, Adam Whitely?

30:17.232 --> 30:20.156
Adam? Adam?

30:23.238 --> 30:24.615
Come in here, boy.

30:26.616 --> 30:28.459
Come sit over here.

30:31.121 --> 30:33.590
Would you like to have some fun
with Uncle Barry?

30:35.083 --> 30:37.381
We're gonna play a special game,

30:37.544 --> 30:43.517
but you can't tell anybody
ever, ever, ever, okay?

30:44.176 --> 30:47.476
Now, what I want you to do
is put your hand down here

30:47.637 --> 30:50.265
and pull very gently, okay?

30:51.600 --> 30:53.352
Very gently.

30:57.189 --> 30:59.612
That's good. That's good.

31:02.944 --> 31:04.946
Jesus Christ, Adam! Get help!

31:06.031 --> 31:09.535
Adam, Uncle Barry's ping-pongs
are caught in the drain.

31:09.701 --> 31:10.701
Get mummy.

31:10.786 --> 31:12.629
- Get mummy.
- No!

31:12.788 --> 31:14.961
What do you mean, no?

31:15.123 --> 31:17.546
Never, ever, ever, ever!

31:20.462 --> 31:22.089
You know the best part?

31:22.255 --> 31:23.973
The best part, mum was out playing golf,

31:24.132 --> 31:26.885
and the dirty old fuck was stuck there
for about seven hours.

31:28.303 --> 31:30.146
Oh, and I thought
they were small and wrinkled

31:30.305 --> 31:31.557
before they got in the water.

31:41.817 --> 31:44.912
Hey, I've got a joke.
Who wants to hear a joke?

31:46.655 --> 31:48.407
Come on, Bernice, it's so funny.

31:48.573 --> 31:51.452
You'll laugh so hard,
your lashes will curl all by themselves.

31:51.618 --> 31:54.838
- Do tell us your hilarious joke.
- Okay.

31:55.664 --> 31:59.009
Well, once upon a time, many moons ago,

31:59.167 --> 32:02.592
there was a famous bunch of Indians
called the Fukawi tribe.

32:02.754 --> 32:05.598
And one day,
the son of the great Indian chief

32:05.757 --> 32:07.054
says to his father,

32:07.217 --> 32:10.938
"Dad, why is my friend, Little Hawk,
called Little Hawk?â€œ

32:11.096 --> 32:14.691
- And his father says...
- "Why do you ask, Two Dogs Fucking?"

32:15.517 --> 32:19.363
That's not the end of the joke.
So, anyway, back to me.

32:22.315 --> 32:24.283
- Jesus!
- What's happening?

32:25.068 --> 32:26.490
I don't know.

32:41.418 --> 32:43.386
Oh, my God.

33:01.730 --> 33:05.826
Oh, Felicia, where the fuck are we?

33:15.744 --> 33:19.044
Shit! Shit! Shit!

33:34.930 --> 33:35.931
Oh, shit.

33:41.144 --> 33:43.021
Well, I've had a look around,

33:43.188 --> 33:45.987
and I think we can safely assume
that I now know less about motors

33:46.149 --> 33:50.120
than I did when I first
lifted up that bonnety thing.

33:50.529 --> 33:51.951
Now what?

33:52.864 --> 33:54.584
Let's just not think about it
for the moment

33:54.616 --> 33:55.959
and eat brekkie, shall we?

33:56.117 --> 34:00.122
Oh, that's a novel idea.
Let's stuff ourselves to death.

34:00.372 --> 34:01.874
Imagine the headlines.

34:02.040 --> 34:05.169
"Whales beach themselves in the Outback.

34:05.460 --> 34:08.384
"Mystery bumsticks dead in drag."

34:08.547 --> 34:10.139
Well, there's no point in walking back.

34:10.297 --> 34:11.800
The only life I saw
for the last million miles

34:11.967 --> 34:13.219
were the hypnotized bunnies.

34:13.385 --> 34:15.353
Most of them are now
wedged in the tires.

34:15.512 --> 34:18.857
Well, somebody'll drive past for sure.
We'll keep the ire burning.

34:19.014 --> 34:22.393
Yes, and toast marshmallows and
chill champagne for when they arrive.

34:22.561 --> 34:24.438
What if they don't drive past?

34:24.603 --> 34:27.483
Look, you're not helping here.
Just eat your hormones.

34:27.649 --> 34:30.447
Hell! Why didn't we stick
to the main road?

34:30.610 --> 34:34.331
- What difference does it make now?
- You got us into this, Anthony Belrose,

34:34.489 --> 34:37.117
and I suggest you start thinking
about how to get us back,

34:37.284 --> 34:40.754
or I don't fancy your chances
of ever trying to be a husband again.

34:45.000 --> 34:47.503
Jesus. What are we gonna do?

34:47.668 --> 34:49.670
We're gonna start off
with a little facelift.

34:49.838 --> 34:52.341
Nothing like a new frock
to brighten up your day.

34:56.553 --> 35:01.150
- Purple?
- It's not purple, it's lavender.

35:01.308 --> 35:05.529
- What do you think?
- It's nice in a hideous sort of a way.

35:07.397 --> 35:08.899
Where are you going?

35:09.065 --> 35:10.692
If you think I'm going to sit around

35:10.859 --> 35:13.658
watching Picasso take on
the public transport system,

35:13.820 --> 35:15.822
you've got another thing coming.

35:15.989 --> 35:19.163
I'll be back with the cavalry
in a couple of hours.

35:19.326 --> 35:22.705
There goes a transsexual,
last seen heading south.

35:22.871 --> 35:25.215
We call her Bernie,
but her real name was...

35:25.373 --> 35:26.716
Adam.

38:22.759 --> 38:24.761
Help! Help!

38:26.763 --> 38:27.855
- What's that, Pa?
- What?

38:28.014 --> 38:31.769
Out there, you nong.
Looks like a woman.

38:32.268 --> 38:34.612
Help!

38:37.232 --> 38:38.609
Thank God.

38:44.572 --> 38:49.123
Thank you.
I can't tell you how grateful I am.

39:07.679 --> 39:08.771
You fucking beauty!

39:19.107 --> 39:20.107
Shit!

39:20.149 --> 39:22.868
Bernie, I never thought
I'd be so glad to see you!

39:23.027 --> 39:24.825
I wish I could say the same.

39:25.947 --> 39:27.187
I was just drawing up the will.

39:27.282 --> 39:29.660
Come and meet our saviors.

39:31.369 --> 39:34.122
Tony, Adam, this is
Mr. and Mrs. Spencer.

39:34.289 --> 39:35.586
- Hello.
- Hello.

39:37.792 --> 39:39.544
Wait! Stop!

39:43.464 --> 39:44.716
Shit!

39:47.594 --> 39:50.063
Oh, for goodness sakes,
look at yourself, Mitz.

39:50.805 --> 39:53.558
How many times do I have to tell you
green is not your color?

39:59.522 --> 40:01.195
Do you think about Trumpet much?

40:01.357 --> 40:03.200
- No.

40:04.986 --> 40:07.990
Trumpet was just a nice kid
who had a thing about transsexuals.

40:09.240 --> 40:10.537
Lots of people do.

40:10.700 --> 40:13.328
Sort of bent status symbol, you know?

40:13.494 --> 40:15.792
"Did you know my girlfriend
used to be a boyfriend?"

40:15.955 --> 40:18.754
That sort of thing.
Always good for a supper invite.

40:19.542 --> 40:22.386
Still, it was better than nothing.

40:25.006 --> 40:27.805
Nothing. Nothing for miles.

40:35.642 --> 40:38.065
I've said it before,
and I'll say it again.

40:38.227 --> 40:42.073
- No more fucking ABBA!
- Okay, if we have the time,

40:42.231 --> 40:43.904
we may as well put it to good use.

40:44.067 --> 40:47.697
Come on, girls. Off your snatches.
Rehearsal time.

40:52.283 --> 40:53.883
Okay, two bobs to start with, all right?

40:54.035 --> 40:55.537
Boring.

40:56.371 --> 40:57.998
Ready?

41:04.128 --> 41:08.178
- I did this years ago.
- You did it so beautifully,

41:08.341 --> 41:10.184
and, darling, you do it so well.

41:10.343 --> 41:12.266
Come on. Right, from the top.

41:13.638 --> 41:14.638
One, two.

41:31.906 --> 41:32.907
Hello.

41:34.158 --> 41:35.284
Nice night for it.

42:15.700 --> 42:17.998
I think we just crashed a party.

42:19.454 --> 42:21.206
No, come on. You'll be all right.

42:34.385 --> 42:36.058
Welcome to my office. Have a seat.

42:48.983 --> 42:50.985
Bernice, I don't know what
could've possibly possessed you

42:51.152 --> 42:53.826
- to wear that to a corroboree.
- Shut your face.

43:10.797 --> 43:11.797
Bravo!

43:11.923 --> 43:13.470
Fabulous!

43:17.970 --> 43:21.691
Well, girls, I guess it's our turn.

44:43.347 --> 44:44.724
Hey, take a look at that.

44:48.561 --> 44:51.110
I've got an idea.

45:38.069 --> 45:41.073
So you actually make money
by dressing up like a woman?

45:41.614 --> 45:45.289
Oh, sure. You can make a
fine living in a pair of heels.

45:46.035 --> 45:47.753
Why, Alan, you want a job?

45:58.172 --> 46:01.802
Oh, if only this dress could talk.

46:02.385 --> 46:04.683
You know, sometimes I wonder
where I get my taste from.

46:04.845 --> 46:06.097
Definitely not my mother.

46:06.264 --> 46:09.609
Oh, well, serves me right for letting
her buy me all those awful clothes.

46:12.019 --> 46:13.236
What's this?

46:15.189 --> 46:18.614
That, my darling, is my most treasured
possession in the whole, wide world.

46:19.277 --> 46:20.494
But what is it?

46:21.487 --> 46:22.534
Well, a few years ago,

46:22.697 --> 46:25.075
I went on a pilgrimage
backstage to an ABBA concert

46:25.241 --> 46:28.211
hoping to grab an audience
with Her Royal Highness Agnetha.

46:28.369 --> 46:31.043
Well, when I saw her
ducking into the ladies loo,

46:31.205 --> 46:32.878
naturally I followed her in.

46:33.040 --> 46:36.385
And after she'd finished her business,
I ducked into the cubicle,

46:36.544 --> 46:39.388
only to find she'd left me a little gift
sitting in the toilet bowl.

46:40.798 --> 46:45.520
What are you telling me?
This is an ABBA turd?

46:48.889 --> 46:50.391
I know what we can do with this.

46:52.059 --> 46:55.154
- Are you right?
- Hang on.

46:56.147 --> 46:57.740
Okay, go!

47:19.754 --> 47:20.755
There!

47:51.494 --> 47:54.338
Afternoon. What seems
to be the problem?

48:00.127 --> 48:03.176
What a nice dog. What's its name?

48:03.631 --> 48:04.678
Herpes.

48:06.509 --> 48:08.807
If she's good, she'll heel.

48:11.389 --> 48:14.984
Things get pretty quiet around here.
We're a bit starved for entertainment.

48:15.142 --> 48:18.316
Glad we could oblige. How does it look?

48:20.648 --> 48:23.151
Your gas tank's
chockablock full of crud.

48:23.317 --> 48:27.288
Traveling on a rough road on a low tank
chucked it all up into the motor.

48:27.446 --> 48:29.915
Your fuel line's blocked,
injectors are stuffed.

48:30.074 --> 48:33.453
- So does that mean you can ix it?
- In the short term.

48:34.453 --> 48:37.081
What you blokes need is a new gas tank.

48:37.748 --> 48:39.125
Don't suppose you have one lying around?

48:39.291 --> 48:41.214
No, sorry.

48:41.377 --> 48:43.471
You could pick one up
in Coober Pedy in about a week.

48:43.629 --> 48:44.909
When do you have to be in Alice?

48:45.714 --> 48:47.432
Six days.

48:48.467 --> 48:50.890
Well, we can clear it out
and hope for the best.

48:51.554 --> 48:55.104
You might make it.
Won't know unless you give it a try.

48:56.183 --> 48:58.277
Refreshments!

48:58.561 --> 49:00.484
Lemonade, here I make.

49:01.021 --> 49:03.615
That's very nice, darling.
Please, go back inside.

49:03.774 --> 49:06.618
Lemonade, here I make.
Lemonade for guests.

49:06.777 --> 49:09.701
No, darling, please.

49:09.864 --> 49:11.866
I made chocolate cracker.

49:15.369 --> 49:16.666
Thank you.

49:17.913 --> 49:20.132
- We put cream on?
- No, no.

49:20.291 --> 49:22.464
It's a face cream. For face.

49:24.044 --> 49:27.264
Bob, Cynthia, thank you.

49:28.424 --> 49:30.392
I love lamb with meringue.

49:30.551 --> 49:31.894
Thank you for the company.

49:32.052 --> 49:35.556
Like I said earlier, new faces
are pretty hard to come by out here.

49:35.723 --> 49:37.817
If you don't mind me asking,
what are you doing off the highway?

49:37.975 --> 49:39.602
Well, now, that's a
bloody good question.

49:40.978 --> 49:43.731
Glad you bothered.
Don't get your type out here very often.

49:45.858 --> 49:50.204
- Me like to sing, too. Me like...
- Yeah, pretty damn quiet.

49:50.362 --> 49:52.364
Thought of opening
a video business for a while.

49:52.531 --> 49:54.750
But I suppose we gotta wait
to get television first.

49:54.909 --> 49:57.207
Me perform for you. Me dance, too.

49:57.369 --> 50:00.498
My wife used to be
in the entertainment business.

50:00.664 --> 50:05.090
- Yeah. You perform here?
- You're thinking of performing here?

50:05.252 --> 50:07.332
I mean, you've got to be here
at least another night.

50:07.421 --> 50:11.267
Um... the thought hadn't really
crossed my mind.

50:11.425 --> 50:13.665
Well, why not? I could have a word
with Wally at the pub.

50:13.802 --> 50:15.429
Everybody would love it.

50:16.514 --> 50:19.688
I'm not sure our show
would go down too well out here.

50:21.685 --> 50:24.108
If you don't mind me asking,
what kind of cabaret do you do?

50:24.271 --> 50:26.444
We dress up in women's clothes
and parade around

50:26.607 --> 50:28.985
mouthing the words
to other people's songs.

50:29.735 --> 50:32.705
You mean sort of like those...
What do they call them...

50:32.863 --> 50:34.035
Les Girls.

50:34.949 --> 50:35.949
Oh, yeah, I've seen them,

50:36.033 --> 50:37.876
way back in Sydney
when I was a young bloke.

50:38.035 --> 50:41.756
- Fantastic. Just terrific.
- Bob, you are looking

50:41.914 --> 50:44.292
at probably the most famous Le Girl

50:44.458 --> 50:45.835
ever produced.

50:46.001 --> 50:48.675
- You're kidding me.
- Give me a break.

50:48.837 --> 50:51.807
- I was never that famous.
- I am not joking.

50:51.966 --> 50:54.970
What? I mean, I wouldn't really
have seen you, but...

50:55.135 --> 50:58.105
- That must've been 30 years back.
- Oh, you'd be surprised.

50:58.639 --> 51:00.312
Me perform for you. Me sing.

51:00.474 --> 51:03.273
No, Cynthia, you no perform.
They perform, not you.

51:10.317 --> 51:15.164
Well, a real, live Les Girls show.
Right. This calls for a celebration.

51:19.243 --> 51:22.497
- Maybe this isn't such a good idea.
- Oh, shut your twat.

51:22.663 --> 51:25.337
Our frocks were the sensation
of Broken Hill, remember?

51:25.833 --> 51:29.758
There was a Kmart in Broken Hill.
At least they knew what a frock was.

51:29.920 --> 51:32.173
Christ, you should see
what this woman's wearing.

51:32.339 --> 51:34.558
It's not a frock,
it's a piece of corrugated iron.

51:39.555 --> 51:41.899
- Can I come in?
- Only if you're single.

51:48.272 --> 51:50.570
Oh, you look incredible.

51:51.692 --> 51:52.944
Where did we find this guy?

51:53.110 --> 51:54.950
You just keep dishing out
the compliments, Bob.

51:54.987 --> 51:58.366
Flattery will get you everywhere.
And where's that lovely wife of yours?

51:58.532 --> 51:59.784
She's at home.

51:59.950 --> 52:01.952
She's not allowed in the pub anymore.

52:02.119 --> 52:03.871
Really? why?

52:05.039 --> 52:06.541
She had a problem with alcohol.

52:06.707 --> 52:09.427
Every time she gets in the pub,
she makes a complete fool of herself.

52:09.543 --> 52:11.420
I know how she feels.

52:13.672 --> 52:15.891
Well, we're all waiting. You ready?

52:16.884 --> 52:20.730
Bob, we're having second thoughts.

52:22.139 --> 52:25.063
You can't back out now.
Every man and his dog's out there.

52:25.225 --> 52:27.102
They're not chained up, by any chance?

52:27.269 --> 52:30.148
You blokes. Sorry. You girls.

52:30.314 --> 52:32.863
Look, you'll be fine.
Take my word for it.

53:48.225 --> 53:49.351
Yeah!

53:52.146 --> 53:53.489
Yeah, right.

54:38.400 --> 54:40.448
What the hell is going on?

55:05.719 --> 55:07.141
Oh, she's not...

55:07.513 --> 55:08.685
Is she?

55:10.933 --> 55:13.436
Oh, you can't do that
with a ping-pong ball.

55:15.521 --> 55:17.319
You wanna bet?

55:59.565 --> 56:00.565
I'm going!

56:00.649 --> 56:02.777
Darling, don't go.
There's nothing we can't work out.

56:02.943 --> 56:05.241
- You no good man.
- Don't be silly.

56:05.696 --> 56:08.745
You want good wife?
You be good husband.

56:08.907 --> 56:09.999
Darling, don't go.

56:11.285 --> 56:14.664
I no like you anyway.
You got little ding-a-ling.

56:29.595 --> 56:31.723
Some days you just
shouldn't get out of bed.

56:32.806 --> 56:34.558
In my opinion, you should wait here

56:34.725 --> 56:37.478
until I get back from Coober Pedy
with a new gas tank.

56:37.644 --> 56:40.818
Then again, you listened
to my last opinion.

56:41.189 --> 56:44.568
Forget it, Bob.
It's time we made a move.

56:44.735 --> 56:47.204
I'm just a gifted amateur round here.

56:47.362 --> 56:49.410
There's no way a nice frock
and a catchy tune

56:49.573 --> 56:51.246
can compete with three ping-pong balls,

56:51.408 --> 56:52.808
two cigarettes, and a pint of beer.

56:52.868 --> 56:54.828
If we break down, we break down.
I'll play it safe

56:54.953 --> 56:56.330
and stick to the main drag.

56:56.496 --> 56:59.090
Pardon the pun. Well, good-bye, Bob.

56:59.249 --> 57:01.502
Thanks for a very educational stay.

57:01.668 --> 57:04.012
Yes, I'd do anything to be able
to open a bottle like that.

57:05.297 --> 57:09.177
Bernadette, it's certainly been an honor
meeting a member of Les Girls.

57:09.343 --> 57:12.347
And may I say it's been an honor
to meet a gentleman.

57:12.512 --> 57:16.858
Believe me, Bob, these days
gentlemen are an endangered species.

57:19.853 --> 57:23.653
Unlike bloody drag queens,
who just keep breeding like rabbits.

57:31.365 --> 57:32.708
Oh, fuck it!

57:34.409 --> 57:38.164
Bob, fancy a free ride to Coober Pedy?

57:44.044 --> 57:46.388
Now listen, Bob,
let's get one thing straight.

57:46.546 --> 57:48.014
We may wear the frocks around here,

57:48.173 --> 57:50.676
but that doesn't mean that
you wear the pants.

57:50.842 --> 57:52.810
Right. Where will I sleep?

57:52.970 --> 57:54.768
Oh, anywhere that takes your fancy.

57:55.472 --> 57:56.974
The roof will do me fine.

57:58.475 --> 58:01.900
Thank you, Bob.
I don't know what to say.

58:02.062 --> 58:05.987
That's all right. Might as well get
there a few days earlier. Bit of R&R.

58:07.484 --> 58:09.578
God knows I need it.

58:33.051 --> 58:36.555
Can I ask you a personal question?
I mean, if you don't mind.

58:36.722 --> 58:37.939
Sure.

58:38.849 --> 58:42.854
Why? Why do you, you know...

58:44.938 --> 58:47.782
You mean, the $64,000 question?

58:47.941 --> 58:51.571
That's a girl.
Now, don't tear the wrapping paper.

58:51.737 --> 58:55.287
Just slide the ribbon off, and we can
see what Santa's brought you.

58:55.449 --> 58:59.625
Here it comes now. What is it?

58:59.786 --> 59:02.209
Oh, it's a... it's a...

59:04.708 --> 59:06.551
Cement mixer.

59:08.587 --> 59:12.387
Have you been changing
the cards around again, Ralph?

59:16.553 --> 59:19.056
So, I guess I had
no choice in the matter.

59:19.222 --> 59:22.522
Oh, for fuck's sake! Watch
where you're driving, you stupid bitch!

59:22.684 --> 59:24.527
What are you trying to do?
Fucking kill me or something?

59:24.686 --> 59:25.686
My fault.

59:25.812 --> 59:28.941
I'm sorry, Bob.
I thought it was Bernadette.

59:31.943 --> 59:35.698
One, two, three.

59:35.864 --> 59:37.491
Now, you're getting it.

59:37.657 --> 59:40.001
- Who taught you to waltz?
- My wife.

59:40.160 --> 59:41.207
Oh, how sweet.

59:41.369 --> 59:43.997
You and the missus, down at
Arthur Murray's every Tuesday night,

59:44.164 --> 59:45.632
practicing your little hearts out.

59:45.791 --> 59:47.964
- Makes me wanna sick up.
- She's a better dancer than you...

59:48.126 --> 59:51.721
- Married?
- Yes, married.

59:51.880 --> 59:55.475
We've only recently discovered young
Anthony here bats for both teams.

59:55.634 --> 59:58.683
- I do not.
- Oh, so we're straight.

59:58.845 --> 01:00:00.267
- No.
- Oh, we're not?

01:00:00.430 --> 01:00:01.870
So, we're a donut puncher after all?

01:00:02.015 --> 01:00:03.688
- No.
- Then what the hell are we?

01:00:03.850 --> 01:00:05.602
I don't fucking know!

01:00:08.438 --> 01:00:09.530
What the fuck's that?

01:00:15.195 --> 01:00:16.663
Good evening.

01:00:17.656 --> 01:00:19.033
Nice night for it.

01:00:20.575 --> 01:00:22.498
Oh, okay. Good night then.

01:00:23.703 --> 01:00:25.205
What a rude woman.

01:00:35.799 --> 01:00:39.144
And that's the power steering pump,
that's the radiator fan.

01:00:39.302 --> 01:00:41.145
- How interesting.
- Simple.

01:00:42.139 --> 01:00:45.018
That's the rubber band
that ties the whole thing together.

01:00:49.104 --> 01:00:51.277
Hey, who wants first bath?

01:01:07.706 --> 01:01:10.209
I won!

01:01:19.426 --> 01:01:20.723
Can I help you, ma'am?

01:01:30.937 --> 01:01:32.780
Okay, turn her over.

01:02:55.272 --> 01:02:56.649
That's it over there.

01:02:57.232 --> 01:02:58.984
It's an okay room with a shower.

01:02:59.150 --> 01:03:00.150
- I'm first!
- I'm first!

01:03:00.193 --> 01:03:02.161
Is hot water all
you can ever think about?

01:03:02.320 --> 01:03:05.665
No. A shower, a comfortable
bed, and a nice meal will do me fine.

01:03:05.824 --> 01:03:08.224
You think I'm gonna crawl
into the sack and watch television,

01:03:08.368 --> 01:03:11.497
- you got another thing coming.
- Now, look, you blokes watch your back.

01:03:11.663 --> 01:03:13.336
This is a pretty tough little town.

01:03:13.498 --> 01:03:14.715
They get up in the morning,
they go down a hole,

01:03:14.874 --> 01:03:16.594
they blow things up,
and they come up again.

01:03:16.626 --> 01:03:18.720
- That about sums things up.
- Fabulous!

01:03:18.878 --> 01:03:22.098
You're welcome to hang out with us, Bob,
if you've got nothing better to do.

01:03:22.257 --> 01:03:26.387
Yeah, I'm meeting some of the boys
at the old drive-in for a booze-up,

01:03:26.553 --> 01:03:28.555
- like the old days.
- I wanna go with Bob.

01:03:28.722 --> 01:03:30.349
I wanna go to the boys club!
I wanna go with Bob!

01:03:30.515 --> 01:03:32.355
You come and have supper
with us, Adam Whitely,

01:03:32.475 --> 01:03:35.024
or you'll stay in your room
by yourself and watch TV.

01:04:02.589 --> 01:04:06.344
- He's a good man, our Bob.
- Yeah.

01:04:07.635 --> 01:04:09.228
Not my type, though.

01:04:09.387 --> 01:04:12.641
Oh, don't come the raw prawn with me.

01:04:12.807 --> 01:04:15.686
I can spot the fluttering of a
beaded lash from 300 paces.

01:04:15.852 --> 01:04:19.447
Oh, get out. He's far too old.

01:04:20.607 --> 01:04:22.450
Mind you, so am I.

01:04:23.818 --> 01:04:25.741
Did you catch that mail-order bride?

01:04:27.989 --> 01:04:30.492
Why'd he marry? I'm dying to ask.

01:04:32.869 --> 01:04:34.792
- Sorry.
- That's all right.

01:04:34.954 --> 01:04:39.630
Don't worry about it.
You're the world's best husband.

01:04:39.793 --> 01:04:43.047
Given the chance,
a perfectly good father, too.

01:04:44.506 --> 01:04:46.133
Do you really think so?

01:04:46.299 --> 01:04:49.143
Why? Thinking about children?

01:04:50.261 --> 01:04:51.808
Yes, as a matter of fact.

01:05:09.823 --> 01:05:12.497
Do you have
The Texas Chainsaw Mascara?

01:05:16.329 --> 01:05:17.831
You ever wanted kids?

01:05:17.997 --> 01:05:21.968
Sure. But I've learnt not
to think about it.

01:05:25.338 --> 01:05:28.387
Do you think an old queen's
capable of raising a child?

01:05:28.550 --> 01:05:32.100
Well, Elizabeth did a pretty good job.

01:05:32.262 --> 01:05:34.185
Prince Charles is a wonderful boy.

01:05:34.806 --> 01:05:37.150
Edward's still a bit of a worry.

01:05:39.561 --> 01:05:41.609
What happens if they turn out like Adam?

01:05:42.730 --> 01:05:45.074
You stuff them back in
and ask for a refund.

01:05:48.736 --> 01:05:50.704
Stupid little shit.

01:05:51.739 --> 01:05:53.867
I dread to think what he's up to.

01:06:22.270 --> 01:06:26.070
Hello. I'm new in town.

01:06:27.066 --> 01:06:28.409
No kidding.

01:06:29.569 --> 01:06:32.573
Could I have a Bloody Mary, please?

01:06:32.739 --> 01:06:35.993
It's a beer or nothing, sweetheart.

01:06:37.410 --> 01:06:39.083
Well, I better have a beer then.

01:06:40.914 --> 01:06:41.915
Cheers.

01:06:46.294 --> 01:06:48.092
What are you all looking at?

01:06:51.257 --> 01:06:52.600
I'm sorry.

01:06:54.135 --> 01:06:57.981
We didn't mean to stare.
We don't usually get women down here.

01:06:58.932 --> 01:07:00.104
Oh.

01:07:01.267 --> 01:07:05.693
So what do women do around here
besides watching videos?

01:07:07.732 --> 01:07:10.656
Well, well, well. Look who we have here.

01:07:12.904 --> 01:07:14.281
You know that bloke, do you?

01:07:19.160 --> 01:07:20.252
No.

01:07:22.121 --> 01:07:25.796
So, who's gonna show me the sights?

01:07:27.835 --> 01:07:31.305
- Be my pleasure.
- Oh.

01:07:34.217 --> 01:07:35.719
So how about it?

01:07:39.138 --> 01:07:41.607
Well, I suppose a fuck's
now out of the question.

01:07:46.980 --> 01:07:48.482
Get her, Frank!

01:07:51.526 --> 01:07:55.281
Come on, boys.
Who wants to see my map of Tasmania?

01:07:56.155 --> 01:07:58.453
So I never got a chance
to tell my parents

01:07:58.616 --> 01:08:00.334
what a wonderful childhood I'd had.

01:08:03.538 --> 01:08:07.668
They never spoke to me again
after I'd had the chop.

01:08:12.797 --> 01:08:15.516
I think I have something to tell you.

01:08:17.969 --> 01:08:19.437
Oh, shit.

01:08:33.234 --> 01:08:35.987
Okay, fellows.
Let's not forget how to treat a lady.

01:08:36.154 --> 01:08:37.371
You fucking freak!

01:08:42.035 --> 01:08:43.332
Hold him down.

01:08:43.493 --> 01:08:45.997
- Spread his legs.
- No, please.

01:08:48.416 --> 01:08:50.417
Frank, stop!

01:08:50.585 --> 01:08:53.714
Stop! What the fuck
do you think you're doing?

01:08:53.880 --> 01:08:55.598
You mean you do know this cocksucker?

01:08:55.756 --> 01:08:57.600
Get off him, you mongrel.

01:08:58.426 --> 01:09:01.930
He was joking, okay?
Now you leave the little bugger alone.

01:09:02.095 --> 01:09:05.066
- Get out of here, Bob.
- Cut it out, Frank.

01:09:05.224 --> 01:09:07.773
Put the faggot down
and get the fuck out of there, Bob,

01:09:07.935 --> 01:09:09.357
- or you'll be next.
- Frank.

01:09:09.520 --> 01:09:10.737
Get out of there!

01:09:10.897 --> 01:09:14.993
Stop flexing your muscles,
you big pile of budgie turd.

01:09:15.151 --> 01:09:17.198
I'm sure your mates
will be much more impressed

01:09:17.362 --> 01:09:21.207
if you just go back to the pub
and fuck a couple of pigs on the bar.

01:09:21.366 --> 01:09:22.868
Bernadette, please.

01:09:23.033 --> 01:09:25.332
Bernadette?

01:09:25.495 --> 01:09:29.250
Well, I'll be darned.
The whole circus is in town.

01:09:29.415 --> 01:09:31.759
I suppose you wanna fuck, too, do you?

01:09:31.917 --> 01:09:35.548
Come on, Bernadette.
Come and fuck me. That's it.

01:09:37.340 --> 01:09:40.640
Come on. Come and fuck me. Come on.

01:09:42.886 --> 01:09:44.059
Fuck me.

01:09:50.060 --> 01:09:52.904
There. Now you're fucked.

01:09:53.856 --> 01:09:56.700
You stupid, bloody idiot.
Drugs, for Christ's sake!

01:09:56.859 --> 01:10:00.363
Well, three cheers for you!
I hope you're bloody well happy now.

01:10:01.698 --> 01:10:02.699
Stupid, bloody fuckwit.

01:10:07.912 --> 01:10:09.129
It's funny.

01:10:10.456 --> 01:10:11.457
We all sit around

01:10:11.624 --> 01:10:15.549
mindlessly slagging off
that vile stinkhole of a city.

01:10:17.255 --> 01:10:19.804
But in some strange way,
it takes care of us.

01:10:21.634 --> 01:10:23.557
I don't know if that
ugly wall of suburbia

01:10:23.720 --> 01:10:29.318
has been put there to
stop them getting in or us getting out.

01:10:32.812 --> 01:10:33.904
Come on.

01:10:35.690 --> 01:10:37.408
Don't let it drag you down.

01:10:38.526 --> 01:10:39.994
Let it toughen you up.

01:10:41.571 --> 01:10:43.915
I can only fight
because I've learned to.

01:10:45.450 --> 01:10:47.168
Being a man one day
and a woman the next

01:10:47.326 --> 01:10:49.420
is not an easy thing to do.

01:10:52.498 --> 01:10:55.251
- Sorry. Can't help you.
- No worries, mate.

01:10:59.005 --> 01:11:01.508
Well, are we bunny-hopping
all the way to Alice?

01:11:01.674 --> 01:11:04.803
No good. He says the man to help us
is a fair way out of town.

01:11:04.969 --> 01:11:06.346
Like how fair?

01:11:06.512 --> 01:11:08.389
Couple of hundred klicks fair.

01:11:08.556 --> 01:11:10.979
No matter. Got nothing else to do today.

01:11:11.142 --> 01:11:12.815
Let's get out of here.

01:11:12.977 --> 01:11:14.775
Come on, Adam, we're not here.

01:11:43.758 --> 01:11:46.011
Some things are said
in the heat of the moment.

01:11:50.223 --> 01:11:52.317
I'm sorry I got angry
with you last night,

01:11:53.559 --> 01:11:55.402
although I daresay you deserved it.

01:11:56.395 --> 01:11:58.272
Anyway, that's enough of that.

01:12:00.149 --> 01:12:03.494
This is quite an experience,
sitting here with you now.

01:12:03.653 --> 01:12:08.159
I quite safely say that
I think your taste in clothing

01:12:08.324 --> 01:12:11.794
is absolutely terrible,
because you can't say a word, can you?

01:12:13.371 --> 01:12:15.419
Oh, this is great fun!

01:12:19.752 --> 01:12:20.912
We're going to have a problem

01:12:21.003 --> 01:12:22.676
finding this guy
with the tank, aren't we?

01:12:22.839 --> 01:12:25.388
- Why do you say that?
- Because he's not out here.

01:12:25.550 --> 01:12:27.769
He's out here. He's in Alice.

01:12:29.262 --> 01:12:31.890
Well, I can't go back
to Coober Pedy for a while.

01:12:32.056 --> 01:12:34.935
Not the most popular bloke
in the world back there anymore.

01:12:48.114 --> 01:12:49.457
Hello.

01:12:49.615 --> 01:12:53.210
- Hello.
- Who are you?

01:12:53.369 --> 01:12:55.292
I your wife.

01:12:57.915 --> 01:13:01.920
- Guess I'll be going home then.
- No, you no going. I coming, too.

01:13:02.086 --> 01:13:03.963
I your wife, see?

01:13:04.130 --> 01:13:05.632
I your wife!

01:13:05.798 --> 01:13:07.050
Silly girl.

01:13:08.801 --> 01:13:10.281
Should have done her homework better.

01:13:11.637 --> 01:13:13.731
She thought I was from Sydney.

01:13:13.973 --> 01:13:16.101
Why in God's name
did you bring her home?

01:13:16.976 --> 01:13:20.321
- She was me wife.
- Couldn't you sell her off?

01:13:20.479 --> 01:13:22.481
Oh, the party's over, everyone.

01:13:22.648 --> 01:13:25.993
It talks. Can't keep a good bitch down.

01:13:26.986 --> 01:13:28.946
What time do you reckon
we'll be in Alice Springs?

01:13:29.655 --> 01:13:31.578
Late tomorrow arvo.

01:13:31.741 --> 01:13:33.789
How long do you think you'll be staying?

01:13:33.993 --> 01:13:37.497
I don't know. Couple of days, maybe.

01:13:37.663 --> 01:13:41.167
Hey, big day for you tomorrow, eh?
We all get to meet the missus.

01:13:41.334 --> 01:13:45.885
I saw that smile, Felicia.
One word, one derogatory word,

01:13:46.047 --> 01:13:48.596
and I'm gonna take you back
to your mate in Coober Pedy.

01:13:50.426 --> 01:13:52.178
Look, please, everyone.
Tomorrow's gonna be a little tough.

01:13:52.345 --> 01:13:54.305
Please don't make it any harder
than it has to be.

01:13:54.347 --> 01:13:55.347
We're only teasing.

01:13:55.473 --> 01:13:57.976
We won't open our mouths
until you give the word.

01:13:59.101 --> 01:14:00.273
Then it's open season.

01:14:14.825 --> 01:14:16.953
Oh, well, time for bed.

01:14:17.119 --> 01:14:18.871
I've got to look good for the wife
in the morning.

01:14:19.038 --> 01:14:20.631
Come along, Adam.
Time for your beauty sleep.

01:14:20.790 --> 01:14:22.884
Come on.

01:14:24.251 --> 01:14:25.798
Will you two be joining us?

01:14:28.047 --> 01:14:29.845
I just thought I'd have one
for the road.

01:14:30.007 --> 01:14:33.102
- How about you, Bob?
- Sounds good to me.

01:14:33.260 --> 01:14:35.638
All right, then. See you in the morning.

01:14:36.097 --> 01:14:37.223
Good night.

01:14:39.850 --> 01:14:42.899
- Another piece of cake, Bob?
- No.

01:14:48.234 --> 01:14:52.330
So, tell me about you.

01:14:53.864 --> 01:14:57.368
Can't complain.
Life's a lot simpler now.

01:14:57.535 --> 01:15:00.584
I spent 30 years
wandering around the world

01:15:00.746 --> 01:15:04.421
only to find that I was better off
where I started.

01:15:05.918 --> 01:15:07.511
Not much, but it's my turf.

01:15:08.170 --> 01:15:09.262
Shit!

01:15:24.270 --> 01:15:25.362
Adam.

01:15:27.565 --> 01:15:28.657
Adam.

01:15:29.900 --> 01:15:33.029
- What?
- Guess who didn't come home last night.

01:15:39.952 --> 01:15:42.956
I've waited all my life for this.

01:15:43.122 --> 01:15:46.626
Bernice has left her cake
out in the rain.

01:16:28.793 --> 01:16:30.340
My fucking back's killing me.

01:16:30.836 --> 01:16:32.383
I need a crap.

01:16:32.546 --> 01:16:34.969
- Look, do you want me to go in?
- No, no, I'll go.

01:16:37.635 --> 01:16:39.637
Excuse me, sir.
You can't park your bus here.

01:16:39.804 --> 01:16:41.647
Are you planning on
staying at the hotel?

01:16:41.806 --> 01:16:44.810
Sorry. Could you direct me
to Marion Barber, please?

01:16:45.309 --> 01:16:47.858
- We're the cabaret act from Sydney.
- Oh, right. Right, yeah.

01:16:48.020 --> 01:16:49.818
Just go through to Reception,
and they'll take you right through.

01:16:49.980 --> 01:16:51.152
- Thanks.
- No worries.

01:16:51.315 --> 01:16:53.192
It's all right, Lenny,
it's the drag queens.

01:16:56.278 --> 01:16:58.576
Come on, Bob.
Let's go try on your new frock.

01:16:59.657 --> 01:17:00.829
Quay.

01:17:03.202 --> 01:17:06.126
- Just over there by the back bar.
- Thanks.

01:17:12.253 --> 01:17:14.847
No, those
three kegs didn't arrive.

01:17:15.005 --> 01:17:17.758
I need them today,
not tomorrow, but today.

01:17:17.925 --> 01:17:20.269
You're a doll. What an asshole.

01:17:25.057 --> 01:17:27.105
My God! Husband, husband!

01:17:27.268 --> 01:17:29.566
- It's so good to see you.
- Hiya, wife.

01:17:29.728 --> 01:17:31.605
You're a day late.
I was just gathering the search party.

01:17:31.772 --> 01:17:33.412
- Where are the others?
- They're outside.

01:17:33.440 --> 01:17:35.408
You've lost weight,
you rotten old queer.

01:17:35.568 --> 01:17:36.990
It's about fucking time.

01:17:37.153 --> 01:17:38.905
I can finally get into
that old one-piece of yours.

01:17:39.071 --> 01:17:40.869
- You know, the one with the sunflowers.
- You still got that?

01:17:41.031 --> 01:17:42.078
What the hell do you do with it?

01:17:42.241 --> 01:17:45.461
The Poseidon Adventure routine,
you know. Shelley Winters.

01:17:52.376 --> 01:17:53.969
Where is he?

01:17:57.923 --> 01:18:00.221
I'm very, very angry with you.

01:18:00.384 --> 01:18:04.685
There's one thing I'd like to do to you,
a good spanking.

01:18:04.847 --> 01:18:06.440
You forget it.

01:18:06.599 --> 01:18:08.317
Spank, spank, spank.

01:18:08.475 --> 01:18:10.477
I've got a good mind
to put you over my knee.

01:18:10.644 --> 01:18:14.444
- I'll spank, spank you back.
- Benj.

01:18:15.858 --> 01:18:16.950
Do you remember Tick?

01:18:25.159 --> 01:18:26.786
Hello, Tick.

01:18:31.916 --> 01:18:33.463
Hello.

01:18:35.628 --> 01:18:37.221
Where's the bloody bar?

01:18:42.176 --> 01:18:44.850
- Mr. Belrose?
- Yes?

01:18:46.138 --> 01:18:48.641
Congratulations. it's a boy.

01:18:53.812 --> 01:18:55.109
Shit!

01:18:55.522 --> 01:18:56.489
- You okay?
- What's the matter?

01:18:56.649 --> 01:18:58.026
- Help.
- Oh, my God.

01:18:58.859 --> 01:19:00.827
For Christ sake, Mitz,
why didn't you tell us?

01:19:00.986 --> 01:19:03.239
Why the hell did you have to
shock me like that?

01:19:05.157 --> 01:19:08.286
This lump on my head
is getting bigger by the second.

01:19:08.452 --> 01:19:11.001
I'm about to make
my Northern Territories debut

01:19:11.163 --> 01:19:13.632
looking like a fucking
Warner Brothers cartoon character

01:19:13.791 --> 01:19:15.338
has hit me over the head with an iron.

01:19:15.501 --> 01:19:16.969
I think you look more
like a Disney witch, myself.

01:19:17.127 --> 01:19:19.755
Oh, shut your face, Felicia.
At least I don't look like

01:19:19.922 --> 01:19:22.002
somebody's tried to open
a can of beans with my face.

01:19:22.007 --> 01:19:23.007
I'm sorry, girls.

01:19:23.092 --> 01:19:25.436
I couldn't stand the thought of you
bagging me on the bus for two weeks.

01:19:25.594 --> 01:19:27.346
Anyway, what difference
does it make now?

01:19:27.513 --> 01:19:29.515
About two inches to my head, for one.

01:19:29.682 --> 01:19:32.185
Did you get a good look at him?
He's got my profile, that's for sure.

01:19:32.351 --> 01:19:33.391
I think I'm gonna be sick.

01:19:33.394 --> 01:19:36.364
I hate to be practical here,
but does he know who you are?

01:19:36.522 --> 01:19:38.322
I mean, does he know
what you do for a living?

01:19:38.357 --> 01:19:42.533
He knows he has a father in the
show business, cosmetics industry.

01:19:42.695 --> 01:19:44.538
Oh, Lord. I don't understand.

01:19:44.697 --> 01:19:46.495
No, you don't understand,
so stop trying to.

01:19:46.657 --> 01:19:48.250
- It'll be fine.
- It better be.

01:19:48.409 --> 01:19:51.379
Hello! Stop wearing out that mirror.

01:19:51.537 --> 01:19:53.881
- Do you always knock before you enter?
- Always. Why?

01:19:54.039 --> 01:19:56.079
You haven't got anything to
hide in there, have you?

01:19:56.542 --> 01:19:58.636
All right, girls,
you're on in 10 minutes.

01:19:58.794 --> 01:20:00.637
Sweetheart, you've been on
ever since you were born.

01:20:00.796 --> 01:20:03.265
Hope you're ready to slay them.
The word's out, we've got a big crowd.

01:20:03.424 --> 01:20:06.052
- Like how big?
- A full house.

01:20:06.844 --> 01:20:07.844
Where's Benj?

01:20:07.886 --> 01:20:10.389
Safe and sound, asleep in bed.
Don't you worry about a thing.

01:20:10.556 --> 01:20:13.560
Okay, my little powder puff?

01:20:13.726 --> 01:20:16.070
- Can I come in?
- Now there's a gentleman.

01:20:16.228 --> 01:20:18.151
Of course you can, Bob.

01:20:19.815 --> 01:20:21.317
My Aunt Minnie in here?

01:20:23.694 --> 01:20:26.163
Don't mean to barge in.
Just wanted to wish you luck.

01:20:26.322 --> 01:20:28.120
- Thank you, Bob.
- Thanks.

01:20:29.575 --> 01:20:31.293
To make up for what happened last time.

01:20:31.452 --> 01:20:34.752
Thank you. That's so thoughtful.

01:20:34.913 --> 01:20:36.381
All right, girls,
let's get this show on the road.

01:20:36.540 --> 01:20:38.918
You, out. That's a
10-minute curtain call.

01:20:39.084 --> 01:20:40.085
Good luck.

01:20:43.922 --> 01:20:45.602
That's quite a wife
you've got there, Mitz.

01:20:45.716 --> 01:20:47.116
What does she do in her spare time,

01:20:47.217 --> 01:20:49.595
sand back the hulls of oil tankers
with her tongue?

01:20:49.762 --> 01:20:51.435
She sure is something.

01:20:52.890 --> 01:20:54.733
- Chookers, girls.
- Watch my jaw.

01:20:54.892 --> 01:20:55.939
Be careful with my head.

01:20:56.101 --> 01:20:58.149
Aren't we fabulous?

01:20:59.188 --> 01:21:02.283
Ladies and gentlemen,
Lasseter's Casino of Alice Springs

01:21:02.441 --> 01:21:06.321
presents Miss Mitzi Del Bra,
Miss Felicia Jollygoodfellow,

01:21:06.487 --> 01:21:08.455
and Miss Bernadette Bassenger,

01:21:08.614 --> 01:21:10.867
the Sisters of the Simpson Desert.

01:25:06.143 --> 01:25:08.237
Bravo! Brilliant!

01:25:08.395 --> 01:25:10.864
- Come on, everybody!
- More!

01:25:11.023 --> 01:25:13.697
More, more!

01:25:13.859 --> 01:25:15.406
More!

01:25:15.861 --> 01:25:18.705
- More!
- We want more!

01:25:18.864 --> 01:25:21.868
- Yes! Magnificent!
- Yeah!

01:25:22.034 --> 01:25:23.536
- Bravo!
- More!

01:25:23.702 --> 01:25:26.080
We want more!

01:25:28.290 --> 01:25:31.510
- Come on, snap out of it.
- Come on, mate.

01:25:31.668 --> 01:25:32.920
You'll be fine.

01:25:35.464 --> 01:25:36.511
Come on, love.

01:25:37.883 --> 01:25:39.009
That's it, mate.

01:25:40.302 --> 01:25:41.895
You scared us all for a minute.

01:25:42.054 --> 01:25:44.773
Just had to have that extra little bit
of attention, didn't you?

01:25:44.931 --> 01:25:46.899
Nice one, lovey. Nice one.

01:25:47.059 --> 01:25:49.858
Shit! What are you doing, Marion?

01:25:50.020 --> 01:25:51.020
You liar!

01:25:51.063 --> 01:25:53.065
- You told me he'd be in bed.
- Oh, shush!

01:25:53.231 --> 01:25:55.905
- Drink your daiquiri.
- I hate bloody daiquiri.

01:25:56.068 --> 01:25:58.321
No, you don't.
You love bloody daiquiris.

01:25:59.321 --> 01:26:02.416
At least now I know why drag queens
drink from such big glasses.

01:26:02.574 --> 01:26:06.420
- To make their hands look smaller!
- Oh, ha-ha, Marion.

01:26:06.578 --> 01:26:09.252
What am I going to say to the boy?
I've never been so embarrassed.

01:26:09.414 --> 01:26:11.087
- I think you're overreacting.
- Really?

01:26:11.249 --> 01:26:13.092
Yes, you're just being a drama queen.

01:26:13.251 --> 01:26:16.255
You're gonna have to drop all that shit
if you're gonna be a good father.

01:26:16.880 --> 01:26:18.553
And don't pretend to be surprised.

01:26:18.715 --> 01:26:20.433
I've kept my end of the bargain,
now it's your turn.

01:26:20.592 --> 01:26:22.432
Not forever,
maybe just for a couple of months.

01:26:22.511 --> 01:26:24.354
Why now?

01:26:24.513 --> 01:26:26.982
Because I haven't had a holiday
in eight years.

01:26:27.140 --> 01:26:29.438
I need a rest, Tick. I need some space.

01:26:31.269 --> 01:26:33.109
Reminds me of something I said
not so long ago.

01:26:33.230 --> 01:26:36.450
Well, I do. And besides, it's time
he knew who his father was anyway.

01:26:36.608 --> 01:26:39.737
Yeah, and that's the problem.
I mean, I don't know what to tell him.

01:26:40.278 --> 01:26:42.280
What do you assume I do, lie?

01:26:42.447 --> 01:26:44.950
Assumption, my dear Mitz,
is the mother of all fuck-ups.

01:26:45.117 --> 01:26:47.370
- Don't bitch to me. Bitch to him.
- Thanks for the...

01:26:47.536 --> 01:26:48.458
You might be in
for a pleasant surprise.

01:26:48.620 --> 01:26:49.792
Free advice.

01:26:58.130 --> 01:27:00.929
- Who is it?
- It's me, Bob.

01:27:05.137 --> 01:27:09.643
Your flowers were being mangled.
Thought I'd rescue them for you.

01:27:12.644 --> 01:27:15.113
Good idea. Thanks.

01:27:25.031 --> 01:27:28.035
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

01:27:33.498 --> 01:27:35.500
Do you know what your father
does for a living?

01:27:36.251 --> 01:27:37.423
Yeah.

01:27:41.006 --> 01:27:44.010
So I suppose you know
he doesn't really like girls then.

01:27:44.176 --> 01:27:46.645
Does he have a boyfriend at the moment?

01:27:47.637 --> 01:27:50.231
- No.
- Neither does mum.

01:27:50.390 --> 01:27:53.143
She used to have a girlfriend,
but she got over her.

01:27:58.106 --> 01:28:01.030
Do you want to come play in my room?
I've got Lego.

01:28:02.360 --> 01:28:03.532
Sure.

01:28:09.701 --> 01:28:11.328
Come on, butch, get a move on.

01:28:11.495 --> 01:28:13.839
We can't brand the cattle
all by ourselves.

01:28:14.956 --> 01:28:17.254
Great show last night.
You always end a number like that?

01:28:17.417 --> 01:28:19.340
Always.

01:28:21.671 --> 01:28:23.711
How'd you like to pick her up
every night, Sundance?

01:28:23.715 --> 01:28:24.715
Be a pleasure.

01:28:24.841 --> 01:28:26.559
I think that might include
taking the lady home every evening

01:28:26.718 --> 01:28:30.143
- and tucking her into bed, Jeff.
- What's the pay like, Marion?

01:28:30.305 --> 01:28:32.478
That one's gonna get himself
into trouble one day,

01:28:32.641 --> 01:28:35.361
and if you play your cards right,
you might just be the lucky fellow.

01:28:35.435 --> 01:28:36.937
Come on, all aboard.

01:28:41.399 --> 01:28:43.493
Just watch it with
the innuendos, Marion.

01:28:43.652 --> 01:28:45.654
At least give me a clear shot at this.

01:28:45.821 --> 01:28:49.121
You call dressing up like
a Xanadu production number a clear shot?

01:28:49.282 --> 01:28:52.081
Come on, Tick.
Who's kidding who around here?

01:28:52.244 --> 01:28:54.212
He sure as shit isn't.

01:29:08.426 --> 01:29:09.427
Swimming, swimming.

01:29:13.932 --> 01:29:15.934
Rock. Little Rock.

01:29:16.101 --> 01:29:17.603
Rock. Rock Hudson.

01:29:18.603 --> 01:29:20.526
You silly old gay.

01:29:21.273 --> 01:29:22.274
My turn, my turn!

01:29:22.774 --> 01:29:25.448
Okay, smarty-pants, you give it a go.

01:29:25.902 --> 01:29:27.074
Come on, then.

01:29:27.237 --> 01:29:29.331
- It's a...
- Person.

01:29:29.489 --> 01:29:30.786
- A sexy woman.
- Cat.

01:29:30.949 --> 01:29:32.201
Famous woman.

01:29:34.536 --> 01:29:35.788
- Baby.
- Rocking.

01:29:36.121 --> 01:29:37.623
I know this one.

01:29:37.789 --> 01:29:40.292
- Race horse.
- Cat. Scary cat.

01:29:40.458 --> 01:29:41.960
Scary moose.

01:29:42.460 --> 01:29:43.803
- Scary dog.
- I know, I know.

01:29:43.962 --> 01:29:45.259
No?

01:29:46.006 --> 01:29:47.383
Lindy Chamberlain.

01:29:49.175 --> 01:29:51.519
That was appalling, Benji.
Who taught you that?

01:29:51.678 --> 01:29:53.806
- Mum did.
- Lies, all lies.

01:29:55.765 --> 01:29:59.144
Come on, Adam. Up.

01:30:00.145 --> 01:30:03.820
Time is against us,
and we have things to do.

01:30:06.651 --> 01:30:10.155
- Come on, you butch thing, you.
- No, count me out.

01:30:10.906 --> 01:30:12.533
- All for one.
- Come on, Tick.

01:30:12.699 --> 01:30:13.871
No.

01:30:17.787 --> 01:30:20.131
Come on, Adam,
let's get f rocked.

01:30:26.671 --> 01:30:28.093
So...

01:30:29.174 --> 01:30:32.303
What's it like to finally have a father?

01:30:32.844 --> 01:30:34.517
It's okay.

01:30:39.517 --> 01:30:41.144
Sorry about last night.

01:30:41.311 --> 01:30:43.655
I don't always dress up
in women's clothes.

01:30:43.813 --> 01:30:46.532
I mean, you know,
don't get the wrong idea.

01:30:49.903 --> 01:30:51.783
I mean, I do a lot of
different stuff, you know,

01:30:51.863 --> 01:30:56.994
like Elvis and Gary Glitter.

01:30:57.160 --> 01:30:58.662
ABBA?

01:31:02.290 --> 01:31:05.134
I'm not supposed to know
about the ABBA show,

01:31:05.293 --> 01:31:07.011
but I'd really like to see it.

01:31:07.963 --> 01:31:10.216
Would you do ABBA for me?

01:31:11.841 --> 01:31:13.058
Sure.

01:31:18.890 --> 01:31:20.608
You know what I am, don't you?

01:31:22.268 --> 01:31:24.145
Mum says you're
the best in the business.

01:31:26.523 --> 01:31:29.197
Well, your mother was always
prone to exaggeration.

01:31:33.238 --> 01:31:36.538
Will you have a boyfriend
when we get back to Sydney?

01:31:40.704 --> 01:31:42.206
Maybe.

01:31:44.124 --> 01:31:45.626
That's good.

01:31:57.679 --> 01:31:59.602
- Come on.
- Where are we going?

01:31:59.764 --> 01:32:02.142
We're gonna unleash
the best in the business.

01:32:10.358 --> 01:32:11.826
I had a dream.

01:33:50.583 --> 01:33:53.553
Well, we did it.

01:33:55.588 --> 01:33:57.090
It never ends, does it?

01:33:57.715 --> 01:33:59.388
All that space.

01:34:05.056 --> 01:34:06.273
So what now?

01:34:07.642 --> 01:34:09.644
I think I wanna go home.

01:34:12.021 --> 01:34:13.273
Me, too.

01:34:15.358 --> 01:34:20.239
Well, then, let's finish
the shows and go home.

01:34:35.503 --> 01:34:37.346
Hey, don't go without leaving me
your number, sunshine.

01:34:37.505 --> 01:34:38.802
Already taken care of, Jeff.

01:34:38.965 --> 01:34:40.842
It's at the far end
of the men's cubicle.

01:34:41.009 --> 01:34:42.761
"For a good time, phone Felicia."

01:34:42.927 --> 01:34:45.350
Hey, can we stop at McDonald's
on the way back?

01:34:45.513 --> 01:34:46.513
That's a good idea.

01:34:46.598 --> 01:34:48.100
I've had just about enough of
this shitty food. Fucking crawfish.

01:34:48.266 --> 01:34:49.906
I don't know.
Where the hell do you start?

01:34:50.018 --> 01:34:52.942
Stop it. Lay it on the line, husband.
Don't conceal a thing.

01:34:53.104 --> 01:34:55.527
That's the key. And if he doesn't
like it, stiff bikkies.

01:34:55.690 --> 01:34:56.942
He can always buy his own ticket back.

01:34:57.108 --> 01:34:59.348
What happens when word gets out
that Mitzi's got a minor?

01:34:59.485 --> 01:35:02.113
That's your problem, not his.
He knows when and where to listen.

01:35:02.280 --> 01:35:04.040
Morals are a choice,
and he'll decide his own

01:35:04.157 --> 01:35:05.875
when he's good and bloody well ready.

01:35:06.034 --> 01:35:08.287
Well, that's it. You're all packed.

01:35:08.453 --> 01:35:09.579
Gotta be joking.

01:35:09.746 --> 01:35:12.670
We haven't got Bernadette's shoes
up on board yet.

01:35:12.832 --> 01:35:15.176
I hate to say this.
Wish I was going with you.

01:35:15.335 --> 01:35:19.135
Your gas tank will be fine.
Your axle may be another matter.

01:35:19.297 --> 01:35:21.595
I'm sure the road home
will just be filled with bored mechanics

01:35:21.758 --> 01:35:24.261
waiting for a bus full of drag queens
to spirit them away to a better life.

01:35:24.427 --> 01:35:27.101
I wish. We're not even gonna
spirit gum at this rate.

01:35:27.263 --> 01:35:29.357
- Where the hell's Bernadette?
- Here.

01:35:31.434 --> 01:35:34.904
Come on, Cabanossi tits.
Where are your bags?

01:35:35.063 --> 01:35:36.565
In my room.

01:35:38.316 --> 01:35:41.160
I'm not going.
I've decided to stay here for a while.

01:35:42.153 --> 01:35:44.997
Oh, really? And you're choosing
to tell us about this now?

01:35:45.823 --> 01:35:48.542
She told me a few weeks back.
Just when I was looking for somebody

01:35:48.701 --> 01:35:50.703
to handle the guest entertainment
while I'm away.

01:35:50.870 --> 01:35:51.870
Oh, I get it.

01:35:51.996 --> 01:35:54.840
Who's been playing
hide the sausage, then?

01:35:56.209 --> 01:35:58.337
That's it.
Let's get out of here before I throw up.

01:35:58.503 --> 01:35:59.675
Come on, Benj.

01:36:01.172 --> 01:36:03.140
- Hope you can drive.
- Hey, not without a hug.

01:36:09.639 --> 01:36:11.232
You sure?

01:36:12.058 --> 01:36:13.435
No, I'm not sure.

01:36:15.728 --> 01:36:18.072
But I'll never know
unless I give it a shot.

01:36:33.871 --> 01:36:35.669
I'm as jealous as all hell.

01:36:37.959 --> 01:36:41.384
Shit. Raccoon time again.

01:36:45.049 --> 01:36:46.049
- Bye.
- Bye-bye.

01:36:46.092 --> 01:36:48.265
- Don't forget to write.
- See you. Wish I was staying.

01:36:48.428 --> 01:36:51.227
- Bye. Take care of her now.
- Bye-bye!

01:36:51.389 --> 01:36:52.732
Bye, Mum!

01:36:53.558 --> 01:36:55.401
Yeah. See you, Ralph!

01:39:37.263 --> 01:39:40.437
No, that's enough.
Oh, my tits are falling down.

01:39:42.852 --> 01:39:44.399
Jesus!

01:39:45.021 --> 01:39:49.026
Thank you! Thank you!
It's good to be home!
