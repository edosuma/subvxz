WEBVTT

00:01.501 --> 00:07.215
It is our differences
that make us special.

00:07.298 --> 00:13.304
So, to conclude,
you are your greatest asset.

00:14.264 --> 00:16.683
You are you.

00:22.480 --> 00:26.484
That's the best speech
by a returning alumni I've ever heard.

00:39.164 --> 00:40.165
Hey.

00:43.043 --> 00:46.212
That well-structured
but emotionally resonant piece of oratory

00:46.296 --> 00:48.048
made me remember how sexy you are.

00:48.131 --> 00:50.842
-Carrie! Carrie!

00:50.925 --> 00:55.513
Carrie! Carrie! Carrie! Carrie! Carrie!

00:55.597 --> 01:00.477
Carrie! Carrie! Carrie! Carrie!

01:00.560 --> 01:04.606
-Carrie! Carrie! Carrie! Carrie!
-Carrie!

01:04.689 --> 01:05.940
Carrie?

01:06.024 --> 01:07.734
-Carrie?

01:07.817 --> 01:10.111
I said, do you remember it
being this small?

01:10.195 --> 01:12.072
I swear it was bigger when we were here.

01:12.155 --> 01:13.740
Maybe we've just grown up.

01:14.365 --> 01:15.366
Oh.

01:15.450 --> 01:16.659
-Crazy.
-Crazy.

01:16.743 --> 01:17.786
Jinx!

01:17.869 --> 01:19.829
-Ow!
-Dead arm! No taksies backsies!

01:44.646 --> 01:46.940
Attention, everybody.

01:47.774 --> 01:48.775
Thank you.

01:49.692 --> 01:54.489
Now, we will be kicking off at 7.45
with the head-girl speech.

01:54.572 --> 01:58.284
Then, subject awards, attendance awards,

01:58.368 --> 02:02.705
and finally, our closing keynote alumni.

02:04.165 --> 02:08.086
Now, while I have you all here,
may I remind all parents that--

02:08.169 --> 02:10.421
Michael!

02:11.214 --> 02:15.135
Powers are not permitted
on school premises.

02:15.218 --> 02:17.554
Get down.

02:20.223 --> 02:22.016
-Wanker.
-I heard--

02:24.769 --> 02:26.104
I heard that.

02:32.527 --> 02:35.697
So, I'm getting the outstanding
achievement award,

02:35.780 --> 02:38.116
and Carrie's doing the alumni speech.

02:38.199 --> 02:39.450
What are you doing, Jen?

02:39.534 --> 02:40.535
I'm doing your dad.

02:40.618 --> 02:42.287
-Mary, I swear, I--
-Ian, I know.

02:42.370 --> 02:46.332
Jen has the very important job
this evening of supporting her family.

02:46.416 --> 02:48.835
-Do we trust Jen with important jobs?
-Well, your dad does.

02:48.918 --> 02:50.712
Because I'm giving him blow jobs.
I'm blowing him.

02:50.795 --> 02:52.255
-Mary, I didn't touch--
-Shut up.

02:52.338 --> 02:54.591
Jesus, there's Susan.
Shut up about blowing each other.

02:54.674 --> 02:56.593
-Who's Susan?
-Mum's trying to get in Susan's clique.

02:56.676 --> 02:58.803
-I told her you can read minds.
-What?

02:58.887 --> 03:00.805
I told her you can read minds.

03:00.889 --> 03:02.640
Susan, hello!

03:02.724 --> 03:04.934
How do you stay so young-looking?

03:05.018 --> 03:07.604
We'll be mistaking you
for one of the students next.

03:07.687 --> 03:10.273
But you know, one of the sexy ones.

03:16.237 --> 03:20.074
Andy, congratulations again.
Greenwich Conservatoire?

03:20.158 --> 03:21.784
-Incredible.
-Yes.

03:21.868 --> 03:24.370
And this must be Jen.

03:32.712 --> 03:34.589
Oh.

03:35.924 --> 03:37.550
Yeah, good one.

03:37.634 --> 03:38.676
What do you mean?

03:39.260 --> 03:41.638
Good one.

03:41.721 --> 03:42.680
Yeah, very funny.

03:43.264 --> 03:44.974
You think it's funny that I was asking

03:45.058 --> 03:47.310
if you knew that Mrs Henderson
had passed away?

03:52.899 --> 03:53.900
I…

03:53.983 --> 03:58.363
Oh, I can see Flo waving at me.
I better…

03:59.280 --> 04:02.533
-Why did you tell her I could read minds?
-I thought it sounded impressive.

04:02.617 --> 04:05.495
It's better than explaining
your whole situation.

04:05.578 --> 04:09.040
Jen, look. I know you're riddled
with fear and anxiety.

04:09.123 --> 04:10.917
Feelings of shame around
your changing body.

04:11.000 --> 04:12.418
-That's not what I'm feeling.
-Sorry.

04:12.502 --> 04:16.381
It's hard to differentiate in groups.
Especially teenagers.

04:17.799 --> 04:19.592
No, no, no. That's not normal.

04:19.676 --> 04:23.304
Someone is bursting
at the emotional seams in here.

04:24.013 --> 04:26.015
I'm trained in mental-health first aid.

04:27.642 --> 04:29.769
-I must find them.
-What are you doing?

04:29.852 --> 04:34.482
If I lose one sense,
the others get sharper.

04:34.565 --> 04:36.776
-I feel you.

04:44.701 --> 04:49.163
"Every day, I get to meet people
from all walks of life. From kids…"

04:50.331 --> 04:53.960
What would make this evening go
from unbearable to just about bearable?

04:54.043 --> 04:56.838
Humility and the support of good friends.

04:56.921 --> 04:58.840
Close. Getting shit-faced.

04:59.924 --> 05:02.176
Where are you gonna find drinks
in a school?

05:02.260 --> 05:03.970
-Right where we left them.

05:05.054 --> 05:06.264
The stash.

05:07.974 --> 05:08.975
The stash.

05:21.529 --> 05:24.407
Really think no one's found it
after all these years?

05:24.490 --> 05:28.328
Where do you put something you don't
want disturbed in a Catholic school?

05:37.170 --> 05:38.671
Thank you, Jesus.

05:50.308 --> 05:51.309
Jesus.

05:51.893 --> 05:54.520
I don't know.
I-I should stay sharp for my speech.

05:54.604 --> 05:55.855
And it's a weeknight.

05:55.938 --> 05:56.939
Oh, come on.

05:57.023 --> 05:59.776
It's just sad
if I make poor decisions by myself.

05:59.859 --> 06:01.194
For me?

06:03.988 --> 06:04.947
Ah, class. Fags.

06:05.531 --> 06:06.532
Hello?

06:07.658 --> 06:10.411
We're closing up this corridor.
Is anyone there?

06:16.626 --> 06:19.003
-I think it's Rebecca Baxter.
-Rebecca Baxter?

06:19.087 --> 06:22.298
Rebecca "personally gave half
of our year eating disorders" Baxter?

06:22.382 --> 06:23.758
All the spit just left my mouth.

06:23.841 --> 06:25.426
I always thought
when I'd run into an old bully,

06:25.510 --> 06:28.513
I'd be able to rub something
in their face, but I've got nothing.

06:28.596 --> 06:30.348
What if she makes me cry?

06:30.431 --> 06:33.601
Never let a predator smell your fear.
Come on, quick. Make yourself big.

06:36.437 --> 06:39.273
Carrie Jackson? Jennifer Regan?

06:39.899 --> 06:41.150
Oh, my God.

06:43.486 --> 06:45.738
It has been so long.

06:45.822 --> 06:49.742
How have you guys been? You look so good.

06:49.826 --> 06:51.285
-Why are you here?

06:51.369 --> 06:52.787
I work here. I'm a teacher.

06:52.870 --> 06:55.790
Why? Oh, do they let you hit the kids now?

06:55.873 --> 06:58.626
You were always so funny, Jen.

06:59.877 --> 07:01.421
So, what have you guys been up to?

07:01.504 --> 07:03.381
Oh, God. Duh. What did you get?

07:03.464 --> 07:04.549
Conduit for the dead.

07:04.632 --> 07:07.844
Spooky. Kinda similar actually.
I can revisit memories.

07:08.636 --> 07:11.013
What about you, Jen?
I bet it's something really cool.

07:11.097 --> 07:13.391
What is your deal? Hmm?
Why are you being so nice?

07:13.474 --> 07:15.476
Did you become some
weird kind of Christian,

07:15.560 --> 07:17.103
or-- or are you dying? What is it?

07:19.105 --> 07:24.861
Honestly, when I got my power,
I would go back and watch myself, and…

07:26.571 --> 07:27.572
Oh, boy. Yeah.

07:27.655 --> 07:31.200
So, it turns out, being able to replay
all the terrible things you've ever done

07:31.284 --> 07:33.286
makes you rethink some stuff.

07:33.369 --> 07:36.414
-So I'm nice now.
-Prove it.

07:36.497 --> 07:39.208
Well, it's, like,
more of a general state of being.

07:39.292 --> 07:41.878
-I don't know how to--
-Money. You could give us money.

07:41.961 --> 07:43.713
Um, yeah, all right.

07:46.299 --> 07:49.010
-I've actually only got a 20.
-Yeah. That'll do. Yeah. Yep.

07:49.093 --> 07:50.094
Thank you.

07:50.970 --> 07:53.723
Carrie, are you okay?
You seem a bit tense.

07:53.806 --> 07:56.267
I-I've got some camomile tea
in the staff room.

07:56.350 --> 07:58.686
-Let me make you a cup?
-Okay.

07:58.769 --> 08:01.022
Great, great. It-It's just down the hall.

08:24.462 --> 08:26.047
You gonna be much longer?

08:26.589 --> 08:31.010
I don't know. How long does it take
to wash off the stain of cowardice?

08:31.636 --> 08:33.262
Have you tried scrubbing it?

08:33.346 --> 08:34.347
Leave me alone.

08:34.430 --> 08:36.182
I'd quite like my bed back.

08:36.265 --> 08:37.725
I'll get out when I'm ready.

08:39.852 --> 08:41.103
When will that be?

08:41.187 --> 08:44.815
When I no longer feel
the cruel sting of sadness.

08:46.943 --> 08:49.111
So, like, five minutes?

09:04.877 --> 09:06.379
Jesus.

09:09.507 --> 09:11.717
Why is your mum sending me outfit options

09:11.801 --> 09:13.427
for the family Christmas card?

09:13.511 --> 09:14.804
She still thinks we're together.

09:14.887 --> 09:17.390
I haven't even told her about not getting
into the Conservatoire yet.

09:17.473 --> 09:19.600
I can't tell her
that we've broken up as well.

09:19.684 --> 09:21.727
-Well, it's not my problem.
-I know!

09:25.273 --> 09:27.275
Sort yourself out.

09:36.659 --> 09:37.660
Fuck!

09:43.040 --> 09:45.835
-What are you doing in here?
-I was having a really quiet pooh.

09:45.918 --> 09:48.045
-What did you hear?
-You didn't get into the Conservatoire.

09:48.129 --> 09:50.715
-You've been lying to everyone.
-I haven't.

09:50.798 --> 09:53.134
Oh! You bashed up your violin, didn't you?

09:53.217 --> 09:56.971
I knew this power would come back to
bite you in your freakishly strong arse.

10:00.141 --> 10:01.475
Are you okay?

10:02.143 --> 10:03.352
"Are you okay?"

10:03.436 --> 10:05.062
Yeah, I'm okay.

10:05.146 --> 10:07.106
At least I have something
in my life to ruin.

10:07.189 --> 10:08.733
What is the worst-case scenario for you?

10:08.816 --> 10:10.484
The funeral home stops selling
your foundation?

10:10.568 --> 10:13.946
Why did your girlfriend dump you, anyway?
Did you break her fanny?

10:16.115 --> 10:18.659
-Did you break her fanny?
-It was a hairline pelvic fracture.

10:18.743 --> 10:21.454
Oh, my God! You finger-blasted
your girlfriend into the hospital.

10:21.537 --> 10:24.457
-This is the best day of my life.
-You are such a fucking child.

10:24.540 --> 10:26.959
-I'm gonna tell Mum.
-Don't tell Mum. Please.

10:29.128 --> 10:30.713
I'll do whatever you want.

10:31.922 --> 10:34.508
-Whatever I want.
-Well, not sex stuff. Ew.

10:34.592 --> 10:37.011
-Oh, my God.
-I didn't say sex stuff. Gross.

10:37.094 --> 10:39.180
-It came out in a really nonce-y tone.
-I'll tell you what.

10:39.263 --> 10:40.765
Never call me a nonce again.
That's a start.

10:41.974 --> 10:43.267
-Hello.

10:43.351 --> 10:45.394
-Me again.
-Why didn't I lock the door?

10:46.646 --> 10:47.688
I'm gonna cheer you up.

10:48.314 --> 10:49.440
What are you hiding?

10:50.483 --> 10:51.567
The brush.

10:52.193 --> 10:53.653
Put it down.

10:53.736 --> 10:56.614
One of the few things I remember
from the cat times:

10:56.697 --> 10:58.991
Getting the brush, pure bliss.

10:59.075 --> 11:00.993
-Don't brush me!
-Relax.

11:01.077 --> 11:03.996
The brush is very powerful.

11:04.080 --> 11:05.915
No, I said don't-- d-don't brush me!

11:11.045 --> 11:12.046
Oh.

11:13.506 --> 11:15.091
-It's actually quite nice.
-Shh.

11:15.716 --> 11:18.803
No thoughts. Just brush. Who's a good boy?

11:20.721 --> 11:23.849
-Me.
-And good boys get the brush.

11:25.976 --> 11:27.436
Mmm.

11:27.520 --> 11:28.521
What the fuck! Stop.

11:28.604 --> 11:30.314
-You don't like the brush?
-No, it's fucking weird.

11:30.398 --> 11:31.941
-Then what makes you happy?
-I don't know!

11:32.024 --> 11:34.360
Everyone always yells at me
for not knowing stuff,

11:34.443 --> 11:36.445
but how am I supposed to know
if people won't tell me?

11:36.529 --> 11:37.613
Penguins.

11:39.740 --> 11:41.784
I like videos of penguins falling over.

11:43.244 --> 11:44.745
It's what makes me happy.

11:47.581 --> 11:49.959
You will do anything I say,
or I'm telling.

11:51.293 --> 11:56.966
Girls, Susan has this great story
about Tesco.

11:57.049 --> 11:59.176
It's-- It's mad.

11:59.677 --> 12:00.678
Go on.

12:00.761 --> 12:05.182
I thought something was full price,
and when I got to the till it was reduced.

12:18.988 --> 12:20.489
Oh, Jesus!

12:21.615 --> 12:23.993
It's like Richard Pryor never died.

12:24.827 --> 12:28.038
-Where did you two go to?
-Just doing some sisterly bonding.

12:28.122 --> 12:29.915
I'm so glad that you're here, Susan.

12:29.999 --> 12:33.002
You know, Andy was just about
to do the family dance.

12:33.085 --> 12:36.380
Oh, it's been years since you've done
the family dance.

12:36.464 --> 12:39.008
-I'm not doing the family dance.
-Oh, I wanna see the family dance.

12:39.091 --> 12:40.092
What's the family dance?

12:40.176 --> 12:42.928
It's a dance that Andy made up

12:43.012 --> 12:46.015
when she was taking
break-dancing lessons in primary.

12:46.098 --> 12:48.517
-You said you were too old for it.
-I am.

12:52.605 --> 12:54.607
You're never too old
for the magic of dance.

12:54.690 --> 12:56.442
Oh!

13:26.722 --> 13:29.809
Okay, that's--
that's enough of that. Okay.

13:41.654 --> 13:43.155
Are you cold?

13:43.239 --> 13:44.240
No.

13:44.323 --> 13:46.367
Well, it's a bit chilly, but I'm fine.

13:46.450 --> 13:48.786
Oh, my God. Here.
Just take-- take my jumper.

13:48.869 --> 13:51.330
-No, no, no, no.
-Take my jumper, you--

13:51.413 --> 13:53.874
I'm sorry.
Please take my jumper.

13:54.792 --> 13:55.918
But then you'll be cold.

13:56.669 --> 13:57.628
Here, take my jumper.

13:57.711 --> 13:59.547
-Don't be silly.
-No, I insist.

13:59.630 --> 14:01.173
Okay, that's fine.

14:02.091 --> 14:03.717
-Okay. Sorry. Thank you.
-Thank you.

14:08.305 --> 14:09.306
Thank you.

14:09.390 --> 14:12.643
I was so excited when they said
you'd be back for the alumni speech.

14:13.352 --> 14:15.479
I was a little surprised they asked me.

14:15.563 --> 14:19.024
Shut up. You're like a big, fancy lawyer.
Why not you?

14:19.108 --> 14:22.945
Must be so weird to bump into Jen again.
You guys were so close in school.

14:23.028 --> 14:25.030
Oh, we still are. We-- We live together.

14:25.865 --> 14:26.699
Oh.

14:26.782 --> 14:29.201
You're surprised we're still friends?

14:29.285 --> 14:32.204
No. No, no, no. Not at all. No.

14:33.539 --> 14:35.916
-Well, no. No, no, no.
-What is it?

14:36.000 --> 14:38.168
Do you not think
that she was a bit of a drama queen

14:38.252 --> 14:40.170
and you had to live in her shadow a lot?

14:40.254 --> 14:42.256
I'm sorry, that's so mean. That's just--

14:44.466 --> 14:46.969
I do try, but sometimes, it just…

14:48.470 --> 14:49.763
That's not how I remember it.

14:49.847 --> 14:52.391
She was always there
when it really counted.

14:52.474 --> 14:54.393
Look, if my power has taught me anything,

14:54.476 --> 14:58.647
it's that what you think happened and what
actually happened can be very different.

14:58.731 --> 15:00.482
I'm not remembering it wrong.

15:01.358 --> 15:02.985
I'll show you.

15:03.068 --> 15:04.320
You'll show me.

15:04.945 --> 15:07.448
Let's do it. Memory me.

15:08.574 --> 15:10.993
All right. I'm sure I'm wrong.

15:17.625 --> 15:19.001
When are we?

15:19.084 --> 15:22.588
-Our own prize-giving. Sixth form.

15:22.671 --> 15:24.506
Don't know why
we're in the bathroom though.

15:24.590 --> 15:26.592
The ceremony should be in full swing.

15:26.675 --> 15:27.676
Oh.

15:27.760 --> 15:28.761
What does it say?

15:28.844 --> 15:31.847
I'm not sure.
All the instructions are in Polish.

15:31.931 --> 15:34.308
Well, it's the only one I could find
in the corner sklep.

15:34.391 --> 15:36.226
-Who's the dad?
-I don't know. Michael Duncan.

15:36.310 --> 15:37.645
Daniel Kim.

15:37.728 --> 15:38.729
Tom Welleridge.

15:38.812 --> 15:41.440
Oh! We'll have to do
the <i>Mamma Mia!</i> thing in 18 years.

15:41.523 --> 15:43.025
I can't sing for shit, Carrie.

15:43.108 --> 15:44.526
What am I gonna do?

15:44.610 --> 15:45.778
I thought you were a virgin.

15:45.861 --> 15:48.489
I am. But we shared that bathroom
on the coach trip to Bath,

15:48.572 --> 15:50.532
and I didn't wipe the seat
before I sat down,

15:50.616 --> 15:53.243
and there was something wet,
and I don't know if it was come.

15:53.327 --> 15:55.037
Jen, you're not pregnant.

15:55.120 --> 15:56.163
Oh, you can read Polish?

15:56.246 --> 15:59.625
I need to go and pick up my award.
Best attendance is a big deal.

15:59.708 --> 16:02.711
No, no, no. Stay, please.
No, I'm gonna do one more for luck,

16:02.795 --> 16:04.964
-and I need you to stay and watch me pee.
-Why?

16:05.047 --> 16:07.091
'Cause I'm feeling
very vulnerable now, Carrie.

16:07.174 --> 16:09.635
And I can't focus with that staring at me.

16:11.512 --> 16:13.889
So she stopped you
from picking up your own award.

16:13.973 --> 16:17.559
Okay. That was bad.
But one time doesn't make a pattern.

16:19.019 --> 16:20.229
There.

16:21.271 --> 16:23.983
Show me another one.
I'm sure she'll redeem herself.

16:30.280 --> 16:31.573
Is this my graduation?

16:31.657 --> 16:34.451
I thought I'd pick a day
that's all about you

16:34.535 --> 16:37.413
so that Jen can show
how supportive she is.

16:37.496 --> 16:39.498
Uh, maybe we should try a different day.

16:41.333 --> 16:42.793
Carrie, I need your help.

16:42.876 --> 16:43.961
Mum doesn't know I dropped out.

16:44.044 --> 16:46.922
She thinks I'm graduating today
and she's here. But obviously, I'm not.

16:47.006 --> 16:49.425
So I need to borrow your cap
and stuff real quick. Is that okay?

16:49.508 --> 16:51.051
-What?
-Just for the photo.

16:51.135 --> 16:53.262
-Smile.
-I'm sorry.

16:53.345 --> 16:55.014
I know I'm such a fuck-up.

16:55.097 --> 16:56.765
No. It's-- It's fine.

16:58.851 --> 16:59.935
Smile.

17:03.063 --> 17:04.064
Ready?

17:04.565 --> 17:05.399
Smile.

17:06.400 --> 17:08.193
-Yoo-hoo! Jennifer.
-Hi, Mum!

17:08.277 --> 17:10.446
-You ready?
-Yeah. No, I'm coming.

17:10.529 --> 17:12.031
Two minutes.

17:12.698 --> 17:13.866
Next.

17:15.117 --> 17:16.869
That's it. Chin up a bit.

17:16.952 --> 17:18.871
-Lovely. And smile.

17:20.831 --> 17:25.335
Okay. Historically,
maybe she could've been better.

17:26.003 --> 17:29.089
-But she-- she's changed.
-Mm-hmm.

17:29.173 --> 17:32.426
I mean, you changed. I better give her
the benefit of the doubt.

17:32.509 --> 17:36.972
Or maybe you should sack up
and stop being such a pushover.

17:37.056 --> 17:39.433
Don't get me wrong.
Jen is a self-obsessed bitch.

17:39.516 --> 17:42.770
But you're just as bad,
you simpering fucking jellyfish.

17:45.522 --> 17:48.525
I'm so sorry.
You're just such an easy target.

17:48.609 --> 17:51.320
-I can't help myself.
-It's okay.

17:51.403 --> 17:53.572
You're trying, and that's what counts.

17:54.990 --> 17:58.285
Stand up for yourself, you tepid slut.

17:58.368 --> 18:00.370
I need to remove myself
from this situation.

18:00.454 --> 18:03.040
Carrie, good luck with the speech.
It'll be great.

18:03.123 --> 18:04.208
You have a weird forehead,

18:04.291 --> 18:06.835
and that's the ugliest fucking jumper
I've ever seen in my life. Goodbye.

18:10.005 --> 18:11.173
It's your jumper.

18:16.345 --> 18:17.888
I've written you an acceptance speech.

18:17.971 --> 18:20.015
-I want you to read it.
-No.

18:20.099 --> 18:22.017
-Mum…
-Okay, fine. Give it.

18:25.521 --> 18:27.815
-I'm not reading this.
-Mother!

18:27.898 --> 18:30.234
Okay, okay. I'll read it.

18:31.944 --> 18:33.070
Weirdo.

18:35.197 --> 18:36.198
Oh.

18:36.949 --> 18:38.492
Oh, you're back.

18:38.575 --> 18:41.662
-Are you and Saint Rebecca best buds now?
-No, don't think so.

18:41.745 --> 18:44.123
Ladies and gentlemen,
please take your seats.

18:44.206 --> 18:47.417
Oh, I better go. I wanna get a good seat.
I don't want to miss anything.

18:47.501 --> 18:48.919
-Really?
-Oh, my God.

18:49.002 --> 18:50.796
I've never looked forward
to a speech more in my life.

18:50.879 --> 18:52.047
Oh, thank you.

18:52.131 --> 18:54.133
Michael! Down!

19:02.432 --> 19:03.809
Stupid birds.

19:03.892 --> 19:05.144
You ready to get out now?

19:05.227 --> 19:06.186
I think I am.

19:07.312 --> 19:08.647
But maybe just one more video.

19:09.398 --> 19:11.650
Type in
"funny fire-safety demonstration fails."

19:11.733 --> 19:13.986
There's a really good one
with a guy with a moustache.

19:14.069 --> 19:17.906
I don't wanna spoil it, but don't get
too attached to the moustache.

19:18.782 --> 19:21.577
That man looks a bit like you.

19:21.660 --> 19:22.578
What?

19:22.661 --> 19:25.247
<i>You! You with them?</i>

19:25.998 --> 19:27.332
<i>No, mate. Don't know 'em.</i>

19:30.252 --> 19:32.921
<i>Oh, God! Oh, God!</i>

19:33.005 --> 19:34.006
<i>Oh, God!</i>

19:34.089 --> 19:38.468
-It's got 400,000 views.

19:38.552 --> 19:39.970
Is that a lot?

19:50.063 --> 19:51.398
I'll go sleep in the kitchen.

19:53.775 --> 19:57.321
And the physics prize
goes to Maisie Costas.

19:57.404 --> 19:59.031
Big round of applause, please.

19:59.114 --> 20:01.992
No, no, no, no.

20:02.075 --> 20:03.493
Smaller round of applause, please.

20:08.874 --> 20:10.209
Take that thing off.

20:11.752 --> 20:13.337
I think I've nearly found them.

20:15.297 --> 20:16.298
Oh.

20:16.882 --> 20:19.801
I just want you to know, I'm here for you.

20:21.094 --> 20:24.765
And now,
for the final award of the night.

20:24.848 --> 20:29.144
This goes to a gifted violinist
who recently got into

20:29.228 --> 20:33.815
one of the most prestigious
musical conservatoires in the country.

20:33.899 --> 20:37.027
The award for outstanding achievement
goes to…

20:37.110 --> 20:38.403
Andy Douglas.

20:59.925 --> 21:03.637
Ladies, gentlemen, distinguished guests…

21:05.222 --> 21:07.599
-…Count Dracula.

21:07.683 --> 21:10.018
It's a pleasure to see you all
here this evening.

21:10.102 --> 21:15.816
It might look like I, a humble lesbian,
won this award all by myself,

21:15.899 --> 21:19.403
but my moderate success
is all down to one person.

21:20.112 --> 21:22.197
My sister, Jennifer.

21:22.990 --> 21:24.324
Isn't that lovely?

21:25.993 --> 21:27.744
People say to me,

21:27.828 --> 21:34.126
"Andy, is it a living hell to have
a sister who is a genius and also so hot?"

21:34.209 --> 21:39.464
-And to those people, I say, yes.

21:39.548 --> 21:41.758
But she's also done so much for me.

21:46.513 --> 21:49.433
When I had explosive diarrhoea
at Disneyland Paris,

21:49.516 --> 21:52.561
who bartered with Goofy for his trousers
to cover up my shame?

21:53.395 --> 21:58.608
When I was voted ugliest baby of 2004,
who contested the judgement?

21:58.692 --> 22:01.445
When I demanded Nelson Mandela
be put back in prison…

22:04.323 --> 22:05.574
Do you know what?

22:06.992 --> 22:08.744
I'd like to thank myself for this award.

22:10.037 --> 22:12.706
I've worked hard. I deserve it.

22:13.915 --> 22:18.003
Although,
I would like to dedicate this award

22:18.086 --> 22:21.506
to all the people who have
never achieved anything.

22:22.257 --> 22:25.510
Never been the best at anything.

22:25.594 --> 22:27.637
They must feel really lame

22:27.721 --> 22:31.600
and-- and lash out in pathetic ways
because that's all they can do.

22:31.683 --> 22:36.813
So, yes, this is dedicated to my sister.

22:42.319 --> 22:45.447
-What are you doing?
-Andy didn't get into the Conservatoire

22:45.530 --> 22:48.825
because she can't play the violin anymore
because of her freakish strength.

22:48.909 --> 22:51.119
And she lied to all of you about it.

22:51.203 --> 22:53.205
And she broke her girlfriend's fanny.

23:00.462 --> 23:02.589
I think it might be Andy.

23:02.672 --> 23:05.926
Oh, here we go.
No, we're not falling for it.

23:09.304 --> 23:11.556
Come on. We're not buying it.

23:11.640 --> 23:13.225
What have you done?

23:22.067 --> 23:22.943
No, hey.

23:27.072 --> 23:29.032
Let's get back on track.

23:29.116 --> 23:33.203
Please welcome Carrie Jackson,
class of 2015.

23:40.419 --> 23:43.463
-At the bathroom.
-The bathroom?

23:44.172 --> 23:46.508
What does it mean to achieve?

23:46.591 --> 23:49.594
But you couldn't for one evening,
you little gobshite!

23:49.678 --> 23:51.763
You are a cold and barren woman!

23:51.847 --> 23:54.307
Well, there have been many definitions
over the centuries.

23:54.391 --> 23:56.143
I was absolutely mortified.
Mortified!

23:56.226 --> 23:58.937
Oh, no.
Now Susan's not going to fuck you.

23:59.020 --> 24:01.189
-I don't want to fuck Susan!

24:01.273 --> 24:03.024
-Maybe I'll fuck Susan.

24:03.108 --> 24:05.819
It's the closest I'm going to get
to a loving mother.

24:05.902 --> 24:08.405
-She's joking. She's joking.

24:08.488 --> 24:09.948
Um…

24:12.826 --> 24:16.788
Um, success in the modern world is…

24:19.207 --> 24:20.208
Sorry.

24:25.672 --> 24:27.382
What does it mean to achieve?

24:29.885 --> 24:32.012
Oh, there you are. Where have you been?

24:32.095 --> 24:34.014
I think I left our drinks in here.

24:34.097 --> 24:38.226
Also, I've alienated my entire family and
humiliated myself in front of everyone.

24:38.310 --> 24:39.561
So…

24:45.859 --> 24:47.486
-Carrie?
-What?

24:47.569 --> 24:49.529
I think I've really fucked it actually.

24:49.613 --> 24:52.073
Have you? Again? Shocker.

24:52.157 --> 24:54.117
Why you being weird?
I'm having a crisis here.

24:54.201 --> 24:56.536
-Course you are.
-Can you tell me why you're mad at me?

24:56.620 --> 24:58.872
I don't have the mental capacity
for this right now.

25:03.835 --> 25:05.337
I was meant to speak.

25:05.962 --> 25:08.089
And now, because of your tantrum,
I don't get to.

25:08.173 --> 25:09.716
Oh.

25:10.300 --> 25:13.053
-Why are you laughing?
-I thought it was something serious.

25:13.136 --> 25:15.096
Ah, so it's only your problems
that are important.

25:15.180 --> 25:17.807
I'm sure you have plenty of problems,
with your long-term boyfriend

25:17.891 --> 25:19.726
and your promising career
and your cool power.

25:19.809 --> 25:22.062
My power is not all it's cracked up to be.

25:22.145 --> 25:23.063
It got you a job.

25:23.146 --> 25:25.815
Do you know how many people
wanna speak to me?

25:25.899 --> 25:27.692
Not someone famous.

25:27.776 --> 25:30.278
Not some pharaoh or president. Just me.

25:30.362 --> 25:31.196
No one.

25:31.279 --> 25:34.908
-I have to listen to you now, so…
-No one ever cares what I have to say.

25:35.617 --> 25:38.328
Well, they did tonight. But of course,
you couldn't let that happen.

25:38.411 --> 25:41.248
You couldn't bear an interruption
of the Jen show.

25:41.331 --> 25:42.415
So I'm selfish?

25:42.499 --> 25:45.293
Yes. You always have been.

25:45.377 --> 25:46.545
It's always been about you.

25:46.628 --> 25:48.588
Oh, stop being so dramatic.

25:49.714 --> 25:51.299
Who did I lose my virginity to?

25:52.259 --> 25:54.511
Okay, what foods am I allergic to?

25:54.594 --> 25:55.804
When did my nan die?

25:55.887 --> 25:58.056
-Fifth year.
-My nan's alive.

25:59.140 --> 26:01.017
But as if you know those things about me.

26:01.101 --> 26:04.479
Peter Hamzi, dairy but you refuse
to acknowledge it, 2014.

26:09.150 --> 26:13.196
Look, uh, Carrie, you have no idea
what it's like to be me.

26:14.239 --> 26:15.782
I've got nothing.

26:16.992 --> 26:19.494
I'm sorry if I'm not dealing with it
with enough grace.

26:21.830 --> 26:24.124
Oh, boo-fucking-hoo!

26:25.041 --> 26:27.752
I don't think you ever wanna get a power.
I think you like it.

26:27.836 --> 26:29.921
It gives you an excuse
to be a shitty person

26:30.005 --> 26:31.506
because the world is mean to you.

26:31.590 --> 26:35.719
But has the smallest seed of thought
ever passed through your brain

26:35.802 --> 26:38.972
that maybe you're not some troubled,
tragic martyr?

26:39.055 --> 26:40.473
Maybe you're just a nob.

26:40.557 --> 26:41.641
Fuck off!

26:46.938 --> 26:47.939
Okay.

27:27.604 --> 27:30.649
Kash! The girls are back
