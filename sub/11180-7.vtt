WEBVTT

00:01.380 --> 00:03.969
Well, we're movin' on up
Movin' on up

00:04.107 --> 00:07.179
To the East Side
Movin' on up

00:07.317 --> 00:11.735
To a deluxe apartment
in the sky

00:11.873 --> 00:14.428
Movin' on up
Movin' on up

00:14.566 --> 00:17.672
To the East Side
Movin' on up

00:17.810 --> 00:21.055
We finally got
a piece of the pie

00:23.437 --> 00:25.991
Fish don't fry
in the kitchen

00:26.129 --> 00:28.131
Beans don't burn
on the grill

00:28.269 --> 00:30.858
Took a whole lot of tryin'

00:30.996 --> 00:32.584
Just to get up that hill

00:34.034 --> 00:36.312
Now we're up
in the big leagues

00:36.450 --> 00:38.900
Gettin' our turn at bat

00:39.039 --> 00:41.455
As long as we live,
it's you and me, baby

00:41.593 --> 00:43.319
There ain't nothin' wrong
with that

00:43.457 --> 00:46.046
We're movin' on up
Movin' on up

00:46.184 --> 00:48.703
To the East Side
Movin' on up

00:48.841 --> 00:52.880
To a deluxe apartment
in the sky

00:53.743 --> 00:56.504
Movin' on up
Movin' on up

00:56.642 --> 00:59.645
To the East Side
Movin' on up

00:59.783 --> 01:05.168
We finally got
a piece of the pie

01:08.585 --> 01:10.139
Eee-yeah!

01:11.381 --> 01:14.177
Hey! Four.
One, two, three, four.

01:15.385 --> 01:17.042
Take a blue card.

01:19.803 --> 01:21.978
Collect $10,000
from every other player.

01:24.014 --> 01:25.637
Sorry, Weez.

01:26.534 --> 01:28.950
Boy, you sure are
lucky tonight.

01:29.089 --> 01:31.021
Skill, baby, skill.

01:31.160 --> 01:33.058
Well, that cleans me out.
I'm going to watch TV.

01:33.196 --> 01:35.129
Hey, stay where you are.
I'll lend you the money.

01:35.267 --> 01:37.166
Oh, thank you.
Here's $100.

01:37.304 --> 01:39.340
A hundred dollars?

01:39.478 --> 01:41.825
That ain't gonna last me
no time.

01:41.963 --> 01:42.999
Why don't you make it
a couple of thousand?

01:43.137 --> 01:44.345
A hundred's
all you're getting.

01:44.483 --> 01:46.796
He's even stingy
with play-money.

01:50.248 --> 01:51.249
Hey, Lionel.

01:51.387 --> 01:52.319
Hi.

01:52.457 --> 01:54.528
That job is really
keeping him jumping.

01:54.666 --> 01:57.047
This is the third time
this week he's missed dinner.

01:57.186 --> 01:58.980
With Florence cooking,
I don't blame him.

02:00.603 --> 02:03.261
If I remember right,
you asked for seconds.

02:03.399 --> 02:06.264
That's because I was hoping
they'd be better
than the first.

02:08.576 --> 02:09.957
How was your day?

02:11.683 --> 02:13.167
That good, huh?

02:14.237 --> 02:15.583
Your turn.

02:15.721 --> 02:18.724
George, can't we just call
the game? You're way ahead.

02:18.862 --> 02:20.416
You mean quit? Ain't nothing
worse than a quitter.

02:20.554 --> 02:22.418
Besides, it's still
anybody's game.

02:22.556 --> 02:24.316
That's what's so great
about it.

02:24.454 --> 02:25.731
Go ahead.

02:26.146 --> 02:27.181
Come on, bones.

02:27.319 --> 02:30.426
Ain't no time for jive.

02:30.564 --> 02:33.014
Do your stuff
and give me five.

02:33.567 --> 02:34.637
Have mercy!

02:36.294 --> 02:39.124
One, two, three,
four, five.

02:39.262 --> 02:41.575
Now let's see
what my blue card says.

02:44.888 --> 02:46.027
Ooh-wee!

02:46.166 --> 02:47.822
What you "ooh-wee"ing about?

02:47.960 --> 02:51.826
"Player on your right
must give you all his money

02:51.964 --> 02:53.518
and start game over."

03:00.145 --> 03:01.560
Let me see that.

03:01.698 --> 03:02.803
Sorry about that, honey.

03:02.941 --> 03:04.494
That ain't fair.

03:04.632 --> 03:06.116
Stop acting like a baby.

03:06.255 --> 03:07.670
Ain't nobody
acting like no baby.

03:07.808 --> 03:10.190
Give me back my game.
You can't play
with it no more.

03:14.573 --> 03:16.472
Well, that's okay
for you, Georgie,

03:16.610 --> 03:19.889
and Florence is not going
to let you play
with her rubber ducky.

03:21.201 --> 03:22.478
That's right.

03:25.619 --> 03:28.311
Oh, Lionel, I saved
some dinner for you.
I'll heat it up.

03:28.449 --> 03:30.175
No, thanks, Mom,
I had dinner out.

03:30.313 --> 03:32.212
How come you didn't call
and let us know?

03:32.350 --> 03:34.075
I got so tied up
at work, I forgot.

03:34.214 --> 03:37.044
Forgot? That's not
very considerate.

03:37.182 --> 03:39.357
I'm sorry, Mom.
But starting Monday,

03:39.495 --> 03:41.359
you won't have to worry
about me missing
dinner anymore.

03:41.497 --> 03:43.361
Why? What happens Monday?

03:43.499 --> 03:45.121
Well, I'm moving out.

03:45.259 --> 03:46.502
You're what?

03:46.640 --> 03:48.262
I'm getting my own apartment.

03:48.400 --> 03:50.402
Hey, Lionel, look,
just because your mother's
on your case

03:50.540 --> 03:52.508
for missing dinner...
Oh, no, that's not it, Pop.

03:52.646 --> 03:54.579
Well, what is it, then?

03:54.717 --> 03:56.891
Well, I just found a place
that's better for me.

03:57.029 --> 03:58.341
What could be better
than this?

03:58.479 --> 04:00.205
A beautiful apartment,
a great neighborhood,

04:00.343 --> 04:03.104
and very reasonable
rent, nothing.

04:04.968 --> 04:06.246
Anybody seen the TV Guide?

04:06.384 --> 04:07.971
It's on the desk.

04:08.109 --> 04:11.009
Lionel, don't you know
how hard it is to
find a good apartment,

04:11.147 --> 04:12.700
especially if you're black?

04:12.838 --> 04:14.254
I already got one.

04:14.392 --> 04:16.670
A guy from work is getting
transferred to Pittsburgh,

04:16.808 --> 04:18.534
and I'm taking over
his apartment in the Village.

04:19.155 --> 04:20.329
You moving out?

04:20.467 --> 04:22.814
Yeah, Florence.
It'll be a lot easier on me.

04:22.952 --> 04:24.643
It'll be a lot easier
on me, too.

04:27.128 --> 04:29.614
Now I won't have to
worry about cleaning
your room no more.

04:29.752 --> 04:32.272
What are you talking about?
You never cleaned his room
in the first place.

04:32.410 --> 04:34.826
I know, but now I don't have
to worry about it.

04:38.795 --> 04:41.522
George, you're not going
to let him move out, are you?

04:42.247 --> 04:44.076
Weezy, look,

04:44.214 --> 04:47.114
if our son wants to move out
after all we've done for him,
I can't stop him.

04:47.252 --> 04:48.874
Oh, Pop, don't put it
like that!

04:49.012 --> 04:50.773
No, no. Lionel, look.
You're a grown man now.

04:50.911 --> 04:53.293
Now, if you want to break your
poor old mother's heart...

04:53.879 --> 04:55.018
Old?

04:57.089 --> 05:00.058
To say nothing of your
poor old father's heart,

05:00.196 --> 05:03.648
who's even older
than your poor old mother.

05:04.959 --> 05:07.376
Hey, now, come on,
you two.

05:07.514 --> 05:10.724
Now, look, it's not
that I want to leave,

05:10.862 --> 05:13.036
but that new apartment
is just so convenient.

05:13.174 --> 05:15.142
Now, right now I'm spending
two hours a day

05:15.280 --> 05:17.903
riding to work then to school
then back home again.

05:18.041 --> 05:20.527
I do more traveling
than the globetrotters.

05:20.665 --> 05:22.632
Oh, Lionel,
I'll Miss you.

05:22.770 --> 05:24.220
Oh, don't worry, Mom.
I'll be over to see you.

05:24.358 --> 05:25.290
When?

05:25.428 --> 05:26.498
Every now and then.

05:26.636 --> 05:27.913
Now and then?

05:28.051 --> 05:31.331
When's that? Once a year?
Twice a year?

05:31.469 --> 05:34.299
Mom, do you still
want me to get my
master's degree or not?

05:34.437 --> 05:35.645
Of course...

05:35.783 --> 05:37.060
Then don't pin me down.

05:37.198 --> 05:39.235
Between classes
and work and studying,

05:39.373 --> 05:41.617
I won't have time
to see much of anybody anyway.

05:43.273 --> 05:44.896
Make an appointment
with him, Weezy.

05:45.034 --> 05:47.830
Maybe we can get to see him
by next Christmas.

05:48.693 --> 05:50.073
Oh, it's you.

05:50.211 --> 05:51.420
Hi, Jenny.

05:51.558 --> 05:52.628
Hi, honey.

05:52.766 --> 05:54.630
Uh, do you mind
if I come in?

05:54.768 --> 05:56.321
Lionel's so busy lately

05:56.459 --> 05:58.288
the only time I get to see him
is when he comes home.

05:58.427 --> 05:59.911
Yeah, well...

06:00.049 --> 06:02.223
Yeah, that's right.

06:02.362 --> 06:04.433
You only get a chance
to see him when he
comes home, don't you?

06:04.571 --> 06:07.159
Ah-ha-ha!
Come in! Come in!

06:07.297 --> 06:09.369
How good to see you.

06:10.922 --> 06:12.717
You're pleased to see me?

06:12.855 --> 06:13.959
Of course, I am.

06:15.064 --> 06:16.755
Is everything all right?

06:16.893 --> 06:18.516
You feel okay?
Never felt better
in my life.

06:18.654 --> 06:20.656
And how are you today,
Jenny, my dear?

06:22.243 --> 06:24.936
I was feeling okay,
but I'm not so sure now.

06:25.074 --> 06:26.316
Hi, Mrs. Jefferson.

06:26.696 --> 06:27.801
Hi, Jenny.

06:29.043 --> 06:30.700
Ain't that nice?

06:30.838 --> 06:32.392
Aww!

06:34.221 --> 06:36.844
Hey, George, don't you think
we ought to...

06:36.982 --> 06:38.190
In a minute, Weezy,
in a minute.

06:38.328 --> 06:40.607
Look, my wife and I
have to have a little talk.

06:40.745 --> 06:42.643
We don't want to disturb
you two lovebirds.

06:42.781 --> 06:44.265
Lovebirds?

06:44.404 --> 06:46.406
Yeah,
make yourself comfortable.
We'll go in the kitchen.

06:46.544 --> 06:47.855
The kitchen? But we...

06:47.993 --> 06:50.237
In the kitchen!

06:50.375 --> 06:52.895
I think Lionel has something
very interesting
to tell you, Jenny.

06:53.033 --> 06:54.275
Oh, yeah? What's that?

06:54.414 --> 06:56.933
I think he'd rather give you
the good news himself.

06:57.071 --> 07:00.868
Will you stop
pushing me around
like a piece of furniture?

07:01.006 --> 07:04.182
Oh, I'm sorry, Weezy,
but I just feel so good.

07:04.320 --> 07:05.632
You feel good?

07:05.770 --> 07:08.358
How can you feel good
when you're losing your son?

07:08.497 --> 07:10.360
We ain't losing a son,
we're gaining a son,

07:10.499 --> 07:12.190
because we're losing
a daughter-in-law.

07:14.330 --> 07:16.436
Sometimes you make
as much sense

07:16.574 --> 07:19.266
as Lester Maddox
running the NAACP.

07:20.543 --> 07:21.855
Weezy, don't you understand?

07:21.993 --> 07:23.339
He's not only
moving away from us,

07:23.477 --> 07:25.065
he's also moving away from...

07:26.169 --> 07:27.205
What?

07:27.343 --> 07:28.620
From, you know!

07:30.208 --> 07:31.243
"You know?"

07:31.381 --> 07:33.038
Jenny!

07:33.176 --> 07:36.248
Well, what's that got to do
with Lionel getting
a new apartment?

07:36.386 --> 07:38.561
Did you call me,
Mr. Jefferson?
What? Oh!

07:38.699 --> 07:40.080
Oh. Yeah.

07:40.218 --> 07:42.910
Uh, I just wanted to know
if you're having a good time.

07:44.394 --> 07:45.982
Yeah, I guess so.
Oh, that's good.

07:46.120 --> 07:47.881
That's good.

07:49.779 --> 07:51.678
Weezy, did you forget
what Lionel told us?

07:51.816 --> 07:53.507
He won't have time
to see much of anybody,

07:53.645 --> 07:56.027
and that includes
the zebra out there.

07:56.165 --> 07:57.925
Don't call her that!

07:58.892 --> 08:00.480
Look, Weezy.

08:00.618 --> 08:02.689
He'll start taking
new girls up to his pad,

08:02.827 --> 08:04.380
she'll find out
and they'll break up.

08:05.001 --> 08:06.278
That's terrible.

08:06.865 --> 08:08.039
That's life.

08:10.420 --> 08:11.905
You're wrong, George.

08:12.043 --> 08:14.321
Lionel and Jenny
love each other too much,

08:14.459 --> 08:16.081
thank goodness.

08:16.219 --> 08:17.807
That's the way
of the world, Weezy.

08:17.945 --> 08:20.361
You know what they say
when two people are apart.

08:20.500 --> 08:22.502
"Absence makes the heart
grow fonder?"

08:22.640 --> 08:23.986
No, that ain't
what they say.

08:24.124 --> 08:26.229
They say, "out of sight,
out of mind."

08:27.783 --> 08:29.750
And the more he's out
of her sight, the better.

08:29.888 --> 08:31.131
Hey!

08:31.269 --> 08:32.719
Where are you going?

08:32.857 --> 08:35.411
I just thought of
something to help
furnish Lionel's apartment.

08:35.549 --> 08:36.550
But, George...

08:36.688 --> 08:38.103
Weezy, why don't you
talk to Jenny?

08:38.241 --> 08:40.450
I know she must be feeling
pretty upset by now.

08:40.589 --> 08:41.728
Aw!

08:44.282 --> 08:46.836
What does he mean
I'm feeling upset?

08:46.974 --> 08:50.322
Uh, didn't Lionel tell you
he's moving into
his own apartment?

08:50.460 --> 08:52.773
Oh, sure. I know all about it.
Why should I be upset?

08:53.843 --> 08:56.881
Well, you won't be seeing
so much of him.

08:57.019 --> 08:59.677
I'll be seeing
even more of him.
I'm moving in with him.

09:06.028 --> 09:07.616
Well, that's nice.

09:09.479 --> 09:10.860
You're what?

09:12.966 --> 09:14.174
She's coming with me.

09:14.312 --> 09:16.038
But I thought you
understood that.

09:16.176 --> 09:18.316
No, I didn't
"understood" that!

09:19.766 --> 09:21.422
You mean you're gonna...

09:21.561 --> 09:22.734
You're gonna...

09:22.872 --> 09:23.873
You're gonna...

09:24.011 --> 09:25.599
Live together.

09:26.911 --> 09:28.119
Oh, boy.

09:31.398 --> 09:32.917
Mrs. Jefferson,

09:33.055 --> 09:35.091
this is a very important part
of Lionel's life

09:35.229 --> 09:36.783
and I don't want
to be left out.

09:36.921 --> 09:38.439
Isn't she something?

09:40.890 --> 09:42.961
But can't you wait
until you get married?

09:43.099 --> 09:44.963
But we don't know
when that'll be, do we?

09:45.101 --> 09:46.827
Yeah, and this will be
good practice for us.

09:49.589 --> 09:52.902
That's one thing
that doesn't need practice.

09:55.560 --> 09:58.494
Mom, this will give us a good
head-start on our marriage.

09:59.495 --> 10:01.152
Jenny, what about
your folks?

10:01.290 --> 10:02.809
Oh, they're all for it.

10:03.464 --> 10:04.845
They are?

10:04.983 --> 10:06.606
What did they say
when you told them?

10:06.744 --> 10:09.470
Well, I don't have to tell
them. I know how they think.

10:10.057 --> 10:11.334
Hey, hey, hey.

10:12.612 --> 10:14.614
Lionel, I got
a little surprise for you.

10:14.752 --> 10:17.133
He's got a surprise
for you too, George.

10:17.271 --> 10:18.445
GEORGE:
Oh, yeah, that's great.

10:18.583 --> 10:20.723
Mine's first.

10:20.861 --> 10:22.794
Da-da-da-da dum!
Here you go, Lionel.

10:22.932 --> 10:24.554
A little something special
for your apartment.

10:24.693 --> 10:27.730
Oh, your old boxing trophy
from the Navy.

10:27.868 --> 10:29.283
That's great, Pop.

10:29.421 --> 10:31.216
Uh, George, I think
there's something...

10:31.354 --> 10:33.080
What did I tell you, Weezy?
I knew he'd like it.

10:33.218 --> 10:35.393
I didn't know you used to box,
Mr. Jefferson.

10:35.531 --> 10:38.741
Yeah, Pop only had
five fights,

10:38.879 --> 10:40.985
and he got knocked out
five times.

10:45.058 --> 10:47.474
They handed me
this trophy like this.

10:49.959 --> 10:52.203
That'll look great
on the mantel, Pop.

10:52.341 --> 10:53.929
Don't you think
you should consult

10:54.067 --> 10:56.138
your roommate
about it first?

10:56.276 --> 10:57.657
Roommate? Hey!

10:57.795 --> 10:59.313
I didn't know you were sharing
your pad with a roommate.

10:59.451 --> 11:00.936
That's great.

11:01.074 --> 11:02.800
One of the guys
from work?

11:02.938 --> 11:04.560
No! It's me!

11:05.803 --> 11:06.942
You?

11:08.806 --> 11:10.670
Jenny's moving in
with me.

11:10.808 --> 11:11.981
She's gonna...

11:12.119 --> 11:13.224
She's gonna...

11:14.121 --> 11:15.398
No, she's not gonna...

11:15.882 --> 11:17.297
She's gonna.

11:21.335 --> 11:23.130
Knockout number six.

11:30.068 --> 11:32.001
Don't keep looking
at me like that.

11:32.139 --> 11:34.624
Yeah, George,
say something.

11:34.763 --> 11:37.455
What the hell are you two
trying to pull?

11:38.525 --> 11:40.354
Well, that was something.

11:40.492 --> 11:42.563
Pop, we're not trying
to pull anything.

11:42.702 --> 11:44.186
We just want
to live together.

11:44.324 --> 11:46.429
Yeah, that's what
lovebirds ought to do.

11:46.567 --> 11:47.810
Don't you think so,
Mr. Jefferson?

11:47.948 --> 11:48.949
No, I don't.

11:49.087 --> 11:50.502
Neither do I.

11:50.640 --> 11:52.228
Not until you get married.

11:52.366 --> 11:53.367
Oh, Mom.

11:53.505 --> 11:54.679
Now, you're making
all this fuss

11:54.817 --> 11:56.577
just because we don't
have a marriage license.

11:56.716 --> 11:58.131
It's just a piece of paper.

11:58.269 --> 11:59.753
So is a driver's license,

11:59.891 --> 12:02.791
but if you drive without it,
you get arrested.

12:02.929 --> 12:05.966
But what we're doing
isn't against the law.

12:06.104 --> 12:07.796
It ought to be.

12:07.934 --> 12:09.142
Well, if it were,
you'd have to arrest

12:09.280 --> 12:10.488
half the people
in this country.

12:10.626 --> 12:12.490
That's okay with me.
Oh.

12:13.318 --> 12:15.217
This is getting to be
too much.

12:15.355 --> 12:16.425
Uh... See you later.
Okay.

12:16.563 --> 12:17.909
Ahem! Wait a minute, Jenny.

12:18.047 --> 12:20.187
Um, Jenny.

12:20.325 --> 12:21.775
Now, you know

12:21.913 --> 12:24.157
I've always said you were
a smart girl, don't you?

12:24.744 --> 12:26.607
No, I didn't know.

12:26.746 --> 12:28.851
Oh, yeah. I'm always
saying that.

12:28.989 --> 12:30.439
To who?

12:31.716 --> 12:33.062
To Lionel.

12:33.200 --> 12:34.581
Ain't that right, Lionel?
Ain't I always
saying she's smart?

12:34.719 --> 12:36.963
No.
See, that's his trouble.

12:37.101 --> 12:38.619
He never listens to me.

12:38.758 --> 12:40.621
All right, Mr. Jefferson,
I'm smart enough to know

12:40.760 --> 12:43.141
that when you say that I'm
smart, you're up to something.

12:43.279 --> 12:44.660
Don't get smart with me!

12:45.799 --> 12:47.905
All right.
What do you wanna say?

12:48.043 --> 12:50.839
Okay, Jenny, now,
you want Lionel to
get ahead, don't you?

12:50.977 --> 12:52.047
Sure, I do.

12:52.185 --> 12:53.807
Mmm-hmm. And you know
he's got a lot of studying

12:53.945 --> 12:55.291
and a lot of hard work
ahead of him, don't you?

12:55.429 --> 12:56.499
Sure.

12:56.637 --> 12:59.364
Okay. Now, when a man
has to choose

12:59.502 --> 13:01.884
between his work and a woman,
what does he choose?

13:02.022 --> 13:03.403
He chooses work.

13:03.541 --> 13:05.405
That's right. He chooses...

13:05.543 --> 13:07.131
No, he don't.

13:08.822 --> 13:10.272
And you know it, Weezy.

13:10.410 --> 13:13.689
Lots of times I think
about you rather than
something important.

13:17.106 --> 13:18.763
Keep talking, George,

13:18.901 --> 13:21.317
and none of us
will be living together.

13:25.287 --> 13:26.736
Let me assure you,
Mr. Jefferson,

13:26.875 --> 13:29.394
when Lionel's got work to do,
I'll stay out of his way.

13:29.532 --> 13:31.362
If that's all that's both...
No, that ain't all.

13:31.500 --> 13:33.088
What about
when he ain't working?

13:33.226 --> 13:34.744
Then we'll
play house.

13:36.298 --> 13:38.576
This is nothing
to joke about.

13:38.714 --> 13:40.681
Mom, we're not doing
anything wrong.

13:40.820 --> 13:42.028
We love each other.

13:42.166 --> 13:44.409
We just wanna
be together.

13:44.547 --> 13:47.792
See, that's easy for Lionel
to say because he's a man.

13:47.930 --> 13:49.035
But I'm surprised
at you, Jenny.

13:49.173 --> 13:51.140
I didn't think you were
that kind of a girl.

13:52.417 --> 13:53.522
What kind of a girl?

13:53.660 --> 13:55.351
You know what kind.
They got a name for it.

13:56.214 --> 13:58.527
Oh!
Hey, Pop!

13:58.665 --> 14:00.736
Uh, Jenny, he doesn't know
what he's saying.

14:00.874 --> 14:03.635
That's true
most of the time, isn't it?

14:11.264 --> 14:12.506
Good thing
you found out about

14:12.644 --> 14:15.026
that nasty temper of hers
before it's too late.

14:16.648 --> 14:17.891
Hey, Lionel,
you come back here!

14:18.029 --> 14:19.651
You're not leaving
till we get this settled.

14:19.789 --> 14:21.308
Jenny and I are gonna
move in together

14:21.446 --> 14:22.931
and there's nothing
you can do about it.

14:23.069 --> 14:24.139
Oh, oh, yes,
there is.

14:24.277 --> 14:26.555
Uh, I'll disown you.
That's what I'll do.

14:26.693 --> 14:28.177
No, you can't.

14:28.315 --> 14:30.800
Because you don't own me
in the first place.

14:39.913 --> 14:41.259
Isn't this nice?

14:41.397 --> 14:42.743
Mmm-hmm.

14:42.882 --> 14:44.504
I can't remember
the last time

14:44.642 --> 14:46.886
we were able to spend
a nice quiet evening together.

14:47.024 --> 14:48.473
I can.

14:48.611 --> 14:50.855
Last April
when you had laryngitis.

14:58.932 --> 15:01.176
Hold it. Gotcha.

15:01.314 --> 15:03.385
Hey, you two aren't supposed
to be acting like that.

15:03.523 --> 15:04.455
You're married.

15:04.593 --> 15:05.559
Who's acting?

15:05.697 --> 15:06.906
Ho-ho!

15:07.803 --> 15:10.392
Oh! Mwah! Mwah!

15:10.530 --> 15:12.118
What was that for?

15:12.256 --> 15:14.948
Oh, that was for
how lucky I am to have
parents like you two.

15:15.086 --> 15:16.674
Okay. How much
do you need?

15:16.812 --> 15:18.538
No, I'm serious.

15:18.676 --> 15:19.953
You two are
the greatest.

15:20.091 --> 15:21.782
I'm not gonna deny it.
Are you?

15:21.921 --> 15:23.750
How can I?
It's true.

15:24.958 --> 15:26.856
But what took you so long
to find out?

15:26.995 --> 15:30.067
Oh, I just spent some time
with Mr. Jefferson.

15:30.205 --> 15:31.758
That'll do it.

15:33.380 --> 15:35.831
What's old crazy George
up to now?

15:35.969 --> 15:39.076
Oh, he's really out of it,
you know?

15:39.214 --> 15:42.665
His head's so far back,
nobody's at
where he's coming from.

15:44.012 --> 15:45.703
That's interesting.

15:47.532 --> 15:50.225
I don't know what it means,
but it's interesting.

15:50.363 --> 15:52.296
She means
he's old-fashioned.

15:52.434 --> 15:54.712
TOM: Oh.
Old-fashioned! Huh!

15:54.850 --> 15:57.680
I mean, you should have heard
the way he sounded off
at Lionel and me.

15:57.818 --> 15:59.165
Wait a minute. At you?

15:59.303 --> 16:00.545
Why at you?

16:00.683 --> 16:02.375
Just because I told him
I was gonna go live

16:02.513 --> 16:04.032
with Lionel
in his new apartment.

16:07.932 --> 16:09.623
Right, right.

16:09.761 --> 16:11.004
Oh, no, no.

16:11.142 --> 16:13.627
Now, now, you shouldn't
tease George like that.

16:15.802 --> 16:16.768
Hold it.

16:16.906 --> 16:18.943
You know he's got
no sense of humor.

16:19.081 --> 16:20.980
Tom, I don't think
she's joking.

16:22.188 --> 16:23.258
What?

16:25.260 --> 16:28.228
Well, I'm sorry
I didn't tell you earlier,

16:28.366 --> 16:29.885
but, I mean,
like I told Mrs. Jefferson,

16:30.023 --> 16:31.369
I knew you'd say
it was okay.

16:31.507 --> 16:34.062
Oh-ho-ho, so you
knew that, did you?

16:34.200 --> 16:36.167
You're going off
to live with Lionel?

16:36.305 --> 16:37.410
Yes!

16:37.548 --> 16:39.481
He's got a great place
near where he works.

16:39.619 --> 16:40.827
I'm gonna help him
decorate it,

16:40.965 --> 16:42.277
get some new drapes,
hang some pictures.

16:42.415 --> 16:45.349
Oh, well, I'm glad
you finally told us, Jenny.

16:45.487 --> 16:46.591
So am I.

16:46.729 --> 16:47.903
Now I'll tell you
something.

16:48.041 --> 16:49.249
Forget it.

16:50.871 --> 16:51.976
What?

16:52.114 --> 16:53.978
You heard your mother.
Forget it, Jenny.

16:54.116 --> 16:56.015
Oh, what?
You're kidding, right?

16:56.153 --> 16:58.293
Do you see us laughing?

16:58.914 --> 17:00.605
Wait a minute.
Come on!

17:00.743 --> 17:02.676
I mean, I thought
at least that you two

17:02.814 --> 17:04.575
were living
in this century.

17:04.713 --> 17:06.301
Oh, what happened to
the great liberals?

17:06.439 --> 17:09.442
Jenny Willis, you are not
moving in with Lionel.

17:09.580 --> 17:11.651
But how can you react
this way?

17:12.238 --> 17:13.204
All right.

17:13.342 --> 17:15.724
Give me one
good, rational reason

17:15.862 --> 17:17.208
why I shouldn't move in
with him.

17:17.346 --> 17:18.796
All right. I will.

17:18.934 --> 17:20.349
It's because...

17:21.385 --> 17:23.111
Helen, give her one.

17:26.528 --> 17:27.529
All right.

17:27.667 --> 17:29.255
You are not moving in
with Lionel

17:29.393 --> 17:30.739
because we say so!

17:32.120 --> 17:33.776
Mama,
that's ridiculous!

17:33.914 --> 17:35.709
Now wait a minute, young lady,
don't talk to
your mother like that.

17:35.847 --> 17:36.883
I have made
the decision.

17:41.267 --> 17:43.096
Lionel, you come
out of there!

17:43.579 --> 17:44.925
Do you hear me?

17:45.926 --> 17:47.583
Lionel!

17:49.068 --> 17:51.035
Lionel, this is
your father speaking.

17:52.278 --> 17:54.073
Listen to your mother.

17:56.351 --> 18:00.838
Ah, Lionel, please come out
and let's talk
about this calmly.

18:02.529 --> 18:04.152
Oh! Weezy,
you stay here.

18:04.290 --> 18:05.877
If he comes out,
grab him.

18:09.088 --> 18:10.434
Bentley,
what do you want?

18:10.572 --> 18:13.713
I'd like to have a look at
your john, if you don't mind.

18:16.405 --> 18:18.649
Sorry, but my john
ain't open to the public.

18:18.787 --> 18:21.100
Oh, no, Mr. Jefferson,
you don't understand.

18:21.238 --> 18:23.102
It's not that I like
looking at johns.

18:23.240 --> 18:24.689
I want to see
how it works.

18:24.827 --> 18:26.450
Why can't you look at
your own john?

18:26.588 --> 18:27.796
Ah, there's the rub,

18:27.934 --> 18:30.143
as the masseur
said to the actress.

18:31.731 --> 18:33.146
See, my own john
isn't working.

18:33.284 --> 18:34.665
Well, that's not
quite true.

18:34.803 --> 18:36.632
It won't stop working.

18:36.770 --> 18:39.221
It keeps on going
even when I'm not.

18:42.500 --> 18:44.813
Bentley, look, I'm busy.

18:44.951 --> 18:47.195
It's something to do with
that little thingamajig

18:47.333 --> 18:50.301
which isn't attached properly
to that, uh, whatchamacallit

18:50.439 --> 18:54.340
so that the, the whoosie
won't go down right, you know?
You understand?

18:54.478 --> 18:55.996
I never understand you.

18:56.135 --> 18:58.275
But look, why don't you
just do what you wanna do
and get outta here.

18:58.413 --> 18:59.690
Ah, bless you, Mr. J.

18:59.828 --> 19:02.313
Hello, Mrs. J. I'm going
to have a look at your loo.

19:03.142 --> 19:04.177
My what?

19:04.315 --> 19:05.454
Loo.

19:05.592 --> 19:07.422
Oh, that's British
for "toilet."

19:07.560 --> 19:10.356
You know, "loo"
as in Waterloo.

19:22.747 --> 19:24.887
Is Lionel ever gonna
come out of his room?

19:25.543 --> 19:26.613
No.

19:26.751 --> 19:28.443
I'm afraid all we are doing

19:28.581 --> 19:30.548
is turning him
more and more against us.

19:30.686 --> 19:33.033
He's just being stubborn
and bullheaded.

19:33.172 --> 19:36.071
Now, I wonder
who he got that from.

19:36.209 --> 19:38.487
Oh, come on, Weezy.
Now, don't blame yourself.

19:43.527 --> 19:46.530
If he leaves like this,
it'll break up the family.

19:46.668 --> 19:48.048
I won't let him leave.

19:48.704 --> 19:50.706
We can't stop him.

19:50.844 --> 19:52.984
Maybe it'll be better
if we just tell him,

19:53.778 --> 19:55.539
"Okay. Go live together."

19:55.677 --> 19:57.023
No way.

19:57.161 --> 19:58.576
Is that
what you really want?

20:00.199 --> 20:01.165
No.

20:01.303 --> 20:03.374
But I don't wanna
lose Lionel either.

20:03.512 --> 20:04.996
GEORGE: Oh, come on, Weezy.
Now, don't cry.

20:05.134 --> 20:07.275
LOUISE:
I can't help it.

20:07.413 --> 20:09.311
What are we
gonna do, George?

20:09.449 --> 20:11.279
We're gonna go up
to the Willis' and make them

20:11.417 --> 20:13.660
keep their mixed-up daughter
away from our son.

20:13.798 --> 20:14.834
Oh, but George...

20:14.972 --> 20:16.215
Oh, Jenny...
Keep moving.

20:16.353 --> 20:17.940
Act like you don't
see nobody.

20:19.597 --> 20:20.874
Lionel?

20:22.497 --> 20:24.015
Lionel, are you in here?

20:24.153 --> 20:25.672
BENTLEY:
He's in his room.

20:25.810 --> 20:27.226
What?

20:28.710 --> 20:30.988
Oh! Oh, Mr. Bentley,
it's you.

20:31.126 --> 20:33.301
Yes. I'm trying to
fix my toilet.

20:33.439 --> 20:36.165
Oh, you mean, you're trying
to fix Mr. Jefferson's toilet?

20:36.304 --> 20:38.098
Oh, no. His toilet
works perfectly.

20:38.237 --> 20:39.548
Oh, right!

20:41.274 --> 20:43.656
Hi. Did you talk
to your folks?
Yeah.

20:43.794 --> 20:45.934
Ah. I'll bet
they didn't object.

20:46.072 --> 20:47.556
You lose.
What?

20:47.694 --> 20:51.353
I say, let me be the first
to congratulate you two.

20:51.491 --> 20:52.906
Oh, you know
about us, huh?

20:53.044 --> 20:55.426
Yes. I got a flash
between flushes.

20:59.050 --> 21:00.914
And you don't see
anything wrong in it, do you?

21:01.052 --> 21:04.332
Of course not.
Everyone should be allowed
to lead his own life.

21:04.470 --> 21:05.643
Exactly.

21:05.781 --> 21:07.887
That's all we're trying
to do, Mr. Bentley.

21:08.025 --> 21:09.440
Yes, the trouble
with some people

21:09.578 --> 21:11.925
is that they won't bend to see
the other's point of view.

21:12.063 --> 21:13.513
That's true.
They only wanna
see their side.

21:13.651 --> 21:14.825
Right.

21:14.963 --> 21:17.862
Rather like my mother
and my Brother Malcolm.

21:18.000 --> 21:19.519
They had
a problem too?

21:19.657 --> 21:20.969
Just like yours.

21:21.107 --> 21:23.040
Mother never could
understand Malcolm.

21:23.178 --> 21:25.974
I remember he had
this gorgeous
girlfriend, Gwyneth,

21:26.112 --> 21:29.253
tall, blond,
with a fabulous seat.

21:29.391 --> 21:32.118
Oh. Ha-ha.
Mr. Bentley!

21:33.602 --> 21:36.985
Oh, no. No, that means
she was a fine horsewoman.

21:37.123 --> 21:39.539
I always wanted
a seat like hers.

21:43.509 --> 21:45.062
What happened?

21:45.200 --> 21:47.892
Well, Malcolm was
what you might
call a free spirit.

21:48.030 --> 21:50.447
He only had to
hear "Don't" from
mother, and he did.

21:50.585 --> 21:52.690
So he and Gwyneth
went off to live together

21:52.828 --> 21:54.485
in a cottage in Wales.

21:54.623 --> 21:55.969
Oh, a cottage in Wales?

21:56.107 --> 21:58.075
That sounds so romantic.

21:58.213 --> 21:59.352
Oh, it was.

21:59.490 --> 22:00.836
And mother
was so upset,

22:00.974 --> 22:03.322
she swore she'd never speak
to either one of them again.

22:03.460 --> 22:05.151
But their life together
was so happy

22:05.289 --> 22:08.016
that after a couple of years,
they decided to get married.

22:08.154 --> 22:09.189
All right!

22:09.328 --> 22:10.743
Yes, they had
a huge wedding.

22:10.881 --> 22:12.365
They invited
the whole family.

22:12.503 --> 22:14.643
I remember
everybody came

22:14.781 --> 22:16.507
except of course, mother.

22:16.645 --> 22:18.751
She was still
against them, huh?

22:18.889 --> 22:21.857
No. She had died just
a couple of months earlier.

22:24.273 --> 22:25.447
Oh.

22:25.585 --> 22:28.381
They said it was
pneumonia, but...

22:37.114 --> 22:38.115
Sure, it's your fault!

22:38.253 --> 22:39.496
Can't you control
your own daughter?

22:39.634 --> 22:41.325
Can't you control
your own son?

22:41.463 --> 22:43.051
He ain't to blame.
Jenny is.

22:43.189 --> 22:45.605
And I suppose Lionel
had nothing to do with it.

22:45.743 --> 22:47.676
Of course he did,
but that's nature.

22:48.850 --> 22:50.610
A man is supposed to say,
"What about it?"

22:50.748 --> 22:52.163
The woman
is supposed to say "No."

22:52.301 --> 22:54.062
My son did
what he was supposed to do.

22:54.200 --> 22:55.650
Your daughter didn't.

22:56.720 --> 22:58.756
That's not the stupidest thing
I'll ever hear,

22:58.894 --> 23:00.379
because I know
you'll keep talking.

23:00.517 --> 23:02.519
Oh, yeah?
HELEN: Oh, yeah.

23:02.657 --> 23:04.728
Listen, folks. Jenny and I
have something to say.

23:04.866 --> 23:06.626
You've said enough already.
I don't wanna hear no more.

23:06.764 --> 23:09.388
We've decided
not to move in together.

23:09.526 --> 23:11.804
I said I don't wanna hear...
say what?

23:11.942 --> 23:13.219
That's right, Pop.

23:13.357 --> 23:15.290
We've thought
the whole thing over.
I'm not moving out.

23:15.428 --> 23:16.912
And Jenny and I
are not gonna live together.

23:17.050 --> 23:18.983
Ah!
That's wonderful.

23:19.121 --> 23:20.606
What made you
change your mind?

23:20.744 --> 23:22.953
Mr. Bentley's brother Malcolm.

23:26.094 --> 23:27.475
Well, when did you
meet him?

23:27.613 --> 23:28.993
We never have.

23:29.131 --> 23:30.995
I don't understand.

23:31.133 --> 23:33.446
Well, Mr. Bentley told us
this jive story

23:33.584 --> 23:35.586
about how his mother died
of a broken heart.

23:36.242 --> 23:38.934
His mother's not dead.

23:39.072 --> 23:41.350
Yeah. We knew
he was making it up.

23:41.489 --> 23:43.042
But he was trying
to help

23:43.180 --> 23:44.768
and it did
make us think.

23:44.906 --> 23:46.528
What are they
talking about?

23:46.666 --> 23:47.978
What difference
does it make?

23:48.116 --> 23:49.773
Everything is okay. They ain't
gonna move in together.

23:49.911 --> 23:51.188
Ain't that right, son?
That's right, Pop.

23:51.326 --> 23:52.879
That's my boy.
All right.

23:53.017 --> 23:55.641
We've decided to
get married sooner instead.

23:55.779 --> 23:57.159
What!

23:58.609 --> 24:00.473
I thought
you'd be happy, Pop.

24:00.611 --> 24:02.199
That's just what
you've been pushing for.

24:02.337 --> 24:03.856
HELEN: How soon?

24:03.994 --> 24:05.064
Very soon.

24:05.202 --> 24:06.514
Oh!

24:06.652 --> 24:09.171
Oh, Helen!
Louise!

24:09.309 --> 24:11.346
George!
Don't touch me!

24:11.484 --> 24:13.175
George!

24:42.273 --> 24:46.623
LOUISE: The Jeffersons
was recorded on tape in front
of a studio audience.
