NARRATOR:
Previously on Supernatural:

00:02.670 --> 00:03.921
MARY:
Sammy.

00:04.004 --> 00:06.716
Take your brother outside
as fast as you can. Go.

00:09.927 --> 00:10.928
DEAN:
Dad's on a hunting trip.

00:11.178 --> 00:13.347
And he hasn't been home in a few days.

00:16.809 --> 00:17.852
DEAN:
This is Dad's book.

00:18.060 --> 00:19.895
I think he wants us to pick up
where he left off.

00:20.104 --> 00:22.064
You know, saving people,
hunting things.

00:22.273 --> 00:23.941
The family business.

00:24.024 --> 00:25.317
I gotta find Dad.

00:25.401 --> 00:27.319
It's the only thing I can think about.

00:32.032 --> 00:34.452
GIRL:
Now I lay me down to sleep...

00:34.952 --> 00:37.079
...I pray the Lord my soul to keep.

00:37.163 --> 00:39.248
Thy angels watch me through the night.

00:39.331 --> 00:41.917
And keep me safe till morning light.

00:42.084 --> 00:45.045
-Amen.
-Amen.

00:52.762 --> 00:54.889
Good night, monkey-puss.

00:55.890 --> 00:57.141
Daddy...

00:57.349 --> 00:59.310
...is Mommy coming home?

01:02.938 --> 01:04.899
No, honey.

01:05.441 --> 01:08.402
She's spending the night
at the hospital with your sister.

01:08.652 --> 01:10.029
Hey.

01:10.529 --> 01:11.864
You sleep tight, now.

01:27.922 --> 01:29.840
(WIND BLOWS)

01:32.802 --> 01:34.762
(TAPPING)

02:07.503 --> 02:09.171
(WHIMPERING)

02:47.668 --> 02:49.795
(SCREAMS)

03:06.061 --> 03:08.522
DEAN: Yeah. You probably
missed something, that's what.

03:08.772 --> 03:11.734
Dude, I ran LexisNexis,
local police records, newspapers.

03:11.942 --> 03:13.611
I couldn't find a single red flag.

03:13.819 --> 03:15.738
Are you sure you got
the coordinates right?

03:15.946 --> 03:18.324
Yeah. I double-checked.
It's Fitchburg, Wisconsin.

03:18.532 --> 03:21.160
Dad wouldn't have sent coordinates
if it wasn't important.

03:21.327 --> 03:24.830
I'm telling you, I looked. All I found
was a big, steamy pile of nothing.

03:25.039 --> 03:27.750
If Dad's sending us hunting
for something, I don't know what.

03:27.958 --> 03:29.418
-Maybe he'll meet us there.
-Yeah.

03:29.627 --> 03:32.087
Because he's been so easy
to find up to this point.

03:32.296 --> 03:34.924
You're a real smart-ass, you know that?

03:35.174 --> 03:37.718
I'm sure there's something
in Fitchburg worth killing.

03:37.885 --> 03:39.929
Yeah? What makes you so sure?

03:40.012 --> 03:43.015
Well, because I'm the oldest,
which means I'm always right.

03:43.182 --> 03:46.018
-No, it doesn't.
-It totally does.

04:03.202 --> 04:04.328
Well...

04:04.536 --> 04:08.207
...the waitress thinks that the local
Freemasons are up to something sneaky...

04:08.415 --> 04:11.710
...but other than that, nobody's heard
about anything weird going on.

04:11.919 --> 04:13.712
Dean, you got the time?

04:14.880 --> 04:16.674
Ten after 4.

04:17.007 --> 04:18.467
Why?

04:18.884 --> 04:20.844
What's wrong with this picture?

04:28.268 --> 04:29.895
School's out, isn't it?

04:30.104 --> 04:31.647
Yeah.

04:34.525 --> 04:36.527
So where is everybody?

04:36.777 --> 04:39.613
This place should be crawling
with kids right now.

04:53.961 --> 04:55.879
Sure is quiet out here.

04:56.046 --> 04:58.048
Yeah. It's a shame.

04:58.424 --> 05:01.260
-Why's that?
-You know, kids getting sick.

05:01.468 --> 05:02.886
It's a terrible thing.

05:03.929 --> 05:05.097
How many?

05:05.848 --> 05:07.891
Just five or six, but serious.

05:07.975 --> 05:09.852
Hospital serious.

05:09.935 --> 05:12.521
A lot of parents are
getting pretty anxious.

05:12.771 --> 05:13.939
They think it's catching.

05:14.231 --> 05:15.816
Hm.

05:28.328 --> 05:30.414
Dude. Dude, I am not using this ID.

05:30.622 --> 05:33.876
-Why not?
-Because it says "bikini inspector" on it.

05:34.043 --> 05:37.004
She won't look that close.
Hell, she won't even ask to see it.

05:37.087 --> 05:39.631
It's all about confidence, Sammy.

05:40.841 --> 05:44.303
Hi. I'm Doctor Jerry Kaplan,
Center for Disease Control.

05:45.304 --> 05:46.889
Can I see some ID?

05:47.097 --> 05:48.932
(SNORTS)

05:50.184 --> 05:52.019
Yeah, of course.

05:54.188 --> 05:56.899
Now, could you direct me
to the pediatrics ward, please?

05:58.192 --> 06:01.779
NURSE: Well, just go down the hall.
Turn left. Up the stairs.

06:04.073 --> 06:05.866
See? Told you it'd work.

06:07.076 --> 06:09.161
Follow me. It's upstairs.

06:43.195 --> 06:44.863
SAM:
Dean.

06:53.789 --> 06:55.457
DEAN:
Thanks for seeing us, Dr. Heidecker.

06:55.666 --> 06:59.670
Well, I'm glad you guys are here.
I was just about to call CDC myself.

06:59.878 --> 07:01.255
How'd you find out, anyway?

07:01.338 --> 07:03.423
Oh, some G.P. I forget his name.

07:03.507 --> 07:07.553
He called Atlanta and must've
beat you to the punch.

07:07.636 --> 07:09.888
So you say you've got six cases so far?

07:09.972 --> 07:12.349
Yeah, yeah. Five weeks.

07:12.683 --> 07:16.895
At first, we thought it was garden variety
bacterial pneumonia. Not newsworthy.

07:17.104 --> 07:18.564
But now....

07:19.022 --> 07:20.107
Now what?

07:20.649 --> 07:24.486
The kids aren't responding to antibiotics.
Their white cell counts keep going down.

07:24.695 --> 07:27.406
Their immune systems
just aren't doing their job.

07:27.823 --> 07:30.409
It's like their bodies are wearing out.

07:30.492 --> 07:33.370
NURSE: Excuse me, Dr. Heidecker?
-Ever see anything like this before?

07:33.495 --> 07:34.830
Never this severe.

07:35.038 --> 07:37.291
The way it spreads,
that's a new one for me.

07:37.499 --> 07:40.252
-What do you mean?
-It works its way through families...

07:40.335 --> 07:43.338
...but only the children,
one sibling after another.

07:45.382 --> 07:47.593
You mind if we interview
a few of the kids?

07:47.801 --> 07:49.761
They're not conscious.

07:50.220 --> 07:52.639
-None of them?
-No.

07:54.600 --> 07:56.393
Can we--? Can we talk to the parents?

07:58.270 --> 07:59.605
If you think it'll help.

08:00.647 --> 08:03.275
Yeah, yeah. Who was your
most recent admission?

08:03.692 --> 08:05.444
I should get back to my girls.

08:05.652 --> 08:09.656
We understand that, and we really
appreciate you talking to us.

08:09.990 --> 08:11.533
Now, you say Mary's the oldest?

08:12.409 --> 08:13.744
-Thirteen.
-Okay.

08:13.952 --> 08:15.454
She came down with it first, right?

08:15.662 --> 08:18.290
-And then--
-Bethany, the next night.

08:18.373 --> 08:20.292
Within 24 hours?

08:20.667 --> 08:22.252
I guess.

08:23.378 --> 08:26.048
Look, I already went through
all this with the doctor.

08:26.215 --> 08:28.550
Right. Now, just a few more
questions, if you don't mind.

08:28.759 --> 08:30.385
How do you think
they caught pneumonia?

08:30.469 --> 08:32.888
Were they out in the cold?
Anything like that?

08:32.971 --> 08:35.390
-No, we think it was an open window.
-Both times?

08:37.267 --> 08:40.270
The first time, I don't--
I don't really remember.

08:40.354 --> 08:42.898
But the second time for sure.

08:42.981 --> 08:46.276
-I closed it before I put Bethany to bed.
-So you think she opened it?

08:46.693 --> 08:49.488
It's a second-story window, no ledge.

08:49.655 --> 08:51.448
No one else could have.

08:55.577 --> 08:57.996
You know, this might not be
anything supernatural.

08:58.205 --> 09:00.457
-Might just be pneumonia.
-Maybe.

09:00.666 --> 09:02.876
Or maybe something
opened that window.

09:03.126 --> 09:05.087
I don't know.
Dad sent us here for a reason.

09:05.254 --> 09:08.382
-I think we're barking up the right tree.
-I'll tell you one thing.

09:08.465 --> 09:10.926
-What?
-That guy we just talked to...

09:11.009 --> 09:13.387
...I'm betting it'll be a while
before he goes home.

09:23.647 --> 09:25.440
You got anything over there?

09:25.649 --> 09:27.276
No, nothing.

09:28.277 --> 09:30.112
Yeah, me neither.

09:41.873 --> 09:44.793
-Hey, Dean?
-Yeah.

09:47.129 --> 09:48.880
You were right.

09:49.131 --> 09:50.882
It's not pneumonia.

09:55.220 --> 09:57.014
SAM:
It's rotted.

10:00.642 --> 10:03.228
What the hell leaves
a handprint like that?

10:11.862 --> 10:13.613
JOHN:
All right.

10:13.780 --> 10:17.784
You know the drill, Dean.
Anybody calls, you don't pick up.

10:17.993 --> 10:21.538
If it's me, I'll ring once
and then call back.

10:21.747 --> 10:23.248
You got that?

10:23.332 --> 10:25.959
Don't answer the phone
unless it rings once first.

10:26.043 --> 10:28.378
Come on, dude. Look alive.
This stuff's important.

10:28.879 --> 10:29.963
I know. It's just...

10:30.172 --> 10:33.884
...we've gone over it, like, a million
times, and you know I'm not stupid.

10:34.343 --> 10:37.387
I know you're not, but it only takes
one mistake. You got that?

10:41.683 --> 10:44.895
-All right, if I'm not back Sunday night--
-Call Pastor Jim.

10:46.938 --> 10:49.858
Lock the doors, the windows.
Close the shades.

10:50.108 --> 10:53.278
-And most important--
-Watch out for Sammy.

10:55.280 --> 10:56.656
-I know.
-All right.

10:56.865 --> 11:00.827
-Something tries to bust in?
-Shoot first, ask questions later.

11:02.162 --> 11:04.039
That's my man.

11:07.125 --> 11:10.504
-What's up, Jaga?
-Come closer, Lion-O.

11:20.597 --> 11:22.974
DEAN:
I know why Dad sent us here.

11:28.188 --> 11:30.107
He's faced this thing before.

11:32.776 --> 11:35.237
He wants us to finish the job.

12:02.472 --> 12:04.641
So, what the hell is a Shtriga?

12:04.724 --> 12:08.311
It's kind of like a witch, I think.
They don't know that much about them.

12:08.645 --> 12:11.314
I've never heard of it,
and it's not in Dad's journal.

12:12.315 --> 12:16.027
Dad hunted one in Fort Douglas,
Wisconsin about 16, 17 years ago.

12:16.194 --> 12:18.321
-You were there. You don't remember?
-No.

12:19.030 --> 12:22.284
Guess he caught wind it's in Fitchburg,
and kicked us the coordinates.

12:22.492 --> 12:24.661
-So wait, this....
-Shtriga.

12:24.744 --> 12:27.664
Right. You think it's the same one
Dad hunted before?

12:27.956 --> 12:29.040
Yeah, maybe.

12:29.249 --> 12:31.626
If Dad went after it,
why is it still breathing air?

12:31.710 --> 12:34.087
-Because it got away.
-Got away?

12:34.337 --> 12:36.465
-Yeah, Sammy. It happens.
-Not very often.

12:36.631 --> 12:40.260
I don't know what to tell you. Maybe Dad
didn't have his Wheaties that morning.

12:40.469 --> 12:43.388
-What else do you remember?
-Nothing. I was a kid, all right?

12:53.356 --> 12:54.649
King or two queens?

12:55.233 --> 12:57.068
Two queens.

13:01.072 --> 13:03.033
-Yeah, I bet.
-What'd you say?

13:03.241 --> 13:04.993
Nice car.

13:06.328 --> 13:07.370
-Hi.
-Hi.

13:07.579 --> 13:09.289
-Checking in?
-Yeah.

13:09.498 --> 13:11.875
Do me a favor, go get
your brother some dinner.

13:12.083 --> 13:13.710
I'm helping a guest.

13:18.715 --> 13:20.634
Two queens.

13:22.469 --> 13:24.804
-Funny kid.
JOANNA: Oh, yeah. He thinks so.

13:25.472 --> 13:28.266
-Will that be cash or credit?
-You take MasterCard?

13:28.433 --> 13:31.269
-Mm-hm.
-Perfect. Here you go.

13:49.246 --> 13:51.206
When's Dad gonna get back?

13:51.414 --> 13:52.749
Tomorrow.

13:52.958 --> 13:54.751
-When?
-I don't know.

13:54.960 --> 13:56.836
He usually comes in late, though.

13:57.045 --> 13:58.588
Now, eat your dinner.

13:58.797 --> 14:00.882
I'm sick of "scabetti-ohs."

14:01.466 --> 14:03.635
Well, you're the one who wanted them.

14:03.718 --> 14:05.136
I want Lucky Charms.

14:05.220 --> 14:07.847
-There's no more Lucky Charms.
-I saw the box.

14:08.598 --> 14:10.183
Okay, maybe there is.

14:10.350 --> 14:14.312
But there's only enough left for one bowl,
and I haven't had any yet.

14:37.252 --> 14:39.212
Do you want the prize?

14:41.172 --> 14:42.591
JOANNA:
Sir?

14:44.843 --> 14:46.553
Thanks.

14:56.771 --> 14:59.065
Well, you were right.

14:59.232 --> 15:02.652
It wasn't very easy to find,
but you were right.

15:02.736 --> 15:04.571
A Shtriga is a kind of witch.

15:04.654 --> 15:08.074
They're Albanian, but legends
about them date back to ancient Rome.

15:08.325 --> 15:10.660
They feed off of spiritus vitae.

15:11.620 --> 15:13.663
-Spirit what?
-Vitae.

15:13.747 --> 15:15.790
It's Latin. Translates to "breath of life."

15:15.874 --> 15:19.085
Kind of like your life force or essence.

15:19.336 --> 15:21.838
Didn't the doctor say the kids' bodies
were wearing out?

15:22.047 --> 15:25.842
It's a thought. She takes your vitality,
maybe your immunity goes to hell.

15:26.051 --> 15:27.552
Pneumonia takes hold.

15:27.761 --> 15:29.846
Anyway, Shtrigas can feed off anyone.

15:30.055 --> 15:32.182
-But they prefer--
-Children.

15:32.557 --> 15:33.600
Yeah.

15:33.808 --> 15:36.645
Probably because they have
stronger life force. And get this:

15:36.853 --> 15:41.316
"Shtrigas are invulnerable to all weapons
devised by God and man."

15:42.651 --> 15:44.778
No. That's not right.

15:44.986 --> 15:46.988
She's vulnerable when she feeds.

15:47.197 --> 15:48.657
What?

15:48.740 --> 15:52.744
If you catch her while eating, you can
blast her with consecrated wrought iron.

15:52.827 --> 15:54.663
Buckshots or rounds, I think.

15:55.163 --> 15:58.833
-How do you know that?
-Dad told me. I remember.

16:00.752 --> 16:01.795
Oh.

16:02.045 --> 16:05.465
So anything else
Dad might've mentioned?

16:06.633 --> 16:07.717
No, that's it.

16:11.012 --> 16:12.472
What?

16:14.641 --> 16:15.892
Nothing.

16:16.601 --> 16:17.769
Okay.

16:17.977 --> 16:21.690
So assuming we can kill it when it eats,
we still gotta find the thing first...

16:21.898 --> 16:23.650
...which ain't gonna be a cakewalk.

16:23.733 --> 16:26.403
Shtrigas take a human disguise
when they're not hunting.

16:26.486 --> 16:29.447
-What kind of human disguise?
-Historically, something innocuous.

16:29.656 --> 16:31.658
Anything, but it's usually
a feeble old woman...

16:31.866 --> 16:35.245
...which may be how the whole

all the addresses of the victims.

that have been hit so far.

16:45.213 --> 16:46.881
-And dead center....
-The hospital.

16:47.090 --> 16:51.261
The hospital. When we were there,
I saw a patient, an old woman.

16:51.970 --> 16:53.304
-An old person, huh?
-Yeah.

16:53.471 --> 16:54.681

inverted cross hanging on her wall.

He's in the hospital.

20:38.696 --> 20:40.448

20:40.990 --> 20:42.867
Oh, come on. How?

20:43.451 --> 20:46.120
I should have made sure
the window was latched.

20:46.329 --> 20:49.332
He wouldn't have got pneumonia
if the window was latched.

in Fitchburg.

it goes on for months...

...dozens of kids before
the Shtriga finally moves on.

and then they die.

was this place called Black River Falls...

come up with so far?

We're still working on a few theories.
You'll know something as soon as we do.

than these kids.

-Second, it wouldn't have done any good.

The bastard's bulletproof unless
he's chowing down on something.

24:52.700 --> 24:56.037
And third, I wasn't packing,
which is probably a really good thing...

24:56.245 --> 24:59.874
...because I probably would've just burned
a clip in him off the principle alone.

-It went after Asher.

35:32.422 --> 35:33.757
(COCKS GUN)

35:43.851 --> 35:45.227
-Now?
-Not yet.

36:18.635 --> 36:21.263
Hey! Michael, down!

36:31.607 --> 36:33.066
-Mike, you all right?
-Yeah.

36:33.233 --> 36:35.068
Just sit tight.

36:59.009 --> 37:00.052
Dean!

37:03.722 --> 37:04.806
(GRUNTS)

37:30.207 --> 37:31.667
DEAN:
Hey!

37:32.209 --> 37:33.418
(YELLS)

37:35.045 --> 37:36.588
You okay, little brother?

37:53.647 --> 37:55.065
(HISSING)

38:09.162 --> 38:11.790
It's okay, Michael.
You can come on out.

38:44.197 --> 38:47.367
-Hey, Joanna. How's Asher doing?
-Have you seen Michael?

38:47.534 --> 38:49.953
MICHAEL: Mom! Mom!
-Hey.

38:51.455 --> 38:53.540
-How's Ash?
JOANNA: Got some good news.

38:53.790 --> 38:55.959
-Your brother's gonna be fine.
-Really?

38:56.168 --> 39:00.297
Yeah, really. No one can explain it.
It's-- It's a miracle.

39:01.298 --> 39:04.342
They're gonna keep him overnight,
but after that, he's coming home.

39:04.551 --> 39:07.220
-That's great.
-How are all the other kids doing?

39:07.429 --> 39:11.266
Good. Real good. A bunch of them
should be checking out in a few days.

39:11.349 --> 39:14.061
Dr. Travis says the ward's
gonna be like a ghost town.

39:14.144 --> 39:17.272
Dr. Travis? What about Dr. Heidecker?

39:17.355 --> 39:20.150
Oh, he wasn't in today.
Must have been sick or something.

39:20.817 --> 39:22.527
Yeah. Yeah, must have.

39:24.196 --> 39:27.032
So did anything happen
while I was gone?

39:27.240 --> 39:28.700
No, same old stuff.

39:28.909 --> 39:31.286
-Okay. You can go see Ash.
-Now?

39:31.369 --> 39:33.163
Only if you want to.

39:36.875 --> 39:40.253
I better get going before he hot-wires
the car and drives himself.

39:48.095 --> 39:49.805
It's too bad.

39:50.597 --> 39:52.766
Oh, they'll be fine.

39:53.308 --> 39:55.018
That's not what I meant.

39:55.769 --> 39:59.272
I meant Michael. He'll always know
there are things out there in the dark.

39:59.481 --> 40:01.566
Never be the same, you know?

40:06.530 --> 40:08.782
Sometimes I wish that....

40:10.909 --> 40:11.952
What?

40:12.828 --> 40:15.497
I wish I could have
that kind of innocence.

40:29.136 --> 40:32.180
If it means anything,
sometimes I wish you could too.
