00:13.972 --> 00:17.350
[crickets chirping]

00:20.228 --> 00:22.355
[Inocencia]
Early on, every so often,

00:22.397 --> 00:25.358
when Don Archibaldo
would walk into my room,

00:25.400 --> 00:27.569
I'd pretend I was asleep.

00:27.610 --> 00:28.737
[door hinges squeak]

00:33.241 --> 00:36.619
Then, on some nights,
I would walk into his room,

00:36.661 --> 00:39.539
and he would pretend
he was asleep.

00:41.750 --> 00:44.419
[door closes]

00:44.461 --> 00:46.171
I got pregnant.

00:46.212 --> 00:47.756
At the time,
I was seeing another boy.

00:47.797 --> 00:50.383
A fisherman.

00:50.425 --> 00:52.427
I didn't know
who was the father.

00:52.469 --> 00:54.471
But Don Archibaldo
showed me medical papers

00:54.512 --> 00:57.849
proving he was sterile,
that it couldn't be him.

00:57.891 --> 00:59.476
But you didn't know how to read?

00:59.517 --> 01:03.229
No, but they looked real.

01:03.271 --> 01:05.648
You know, he seemed sincere.
Concerned.

01:05.690 --> 01:07.484
He told me to think
very carefully

01:07.525 --> 01:09.861
about what I wanted to do
with my life,

01:09.903 --> 01:11.571
as this decision
would change everything,

01:11.613 --> 01:13.782
and I was still so young.

01:15.575 --> 01:18.203
So I told him
I would get an abortion.

01:18.244 --> 01:19.579
But you didn't.

01:19.621 --> 01:21.247
[Inocencia] I couldn't.

01:21.289 --> 01:22.624
I gave birth in my village

01:22.665 --> 01:25.210
and left the child
with my mother.

01:25.251 --> 01:26.419
She raised him there

01:26.461 --> 01:28.588
and I would see him
every other month

01:28.630 --> 01:30.590
when I could visit.

01:30.632 --> 01:34.260
Don Archibaldo hired me back
and I took care of the house

01:34.302 --> 01:36.304
as he went
through a series of women.

01:38.181 --> 01:40.517
And the nighttime visits?

01:40.558 --> 01:44.229
There was only one
more time before Alba...

01:44.270 --> 01:48.274
He had a girlfriend.
A television weather girl.

01:48.316 --> 01:52.404
I heard her crying
one night and she left.

01:52.445 --> 01:56.574
The house was so quiet.
A storm was coming.

01:56.616 --> 01:59.244
I heard him in the kitchen.

01:59.285 --> 02:01.371
I was watching my soap.

02:01.413 --> 02:05.792
He stood by the door and said,
"I thought you would be asleep."

02:05.834 --> 02:08.294
"No," I told him,
"Doña Leticia is going through

02:08.336 --> 02:11.381
the most horrible ordeal
with her gardener".

02:11.423 --> 02:14.426
It turns out he has been
sleeping with his own sister.

02:15.885 --> 02:18.179
I kept watching the show.

02:18.221 --> 02:19.848
And when I looked back,

02:19.889 --> 02:22.851
he was standing
very close to me.

02:22.892 --> 02:24.728
He told me,

02:24.769 --> 02:27.313
why don't I give him
some manual relief

02:27.355 --> 02:30.400
and then we can watch
the rest of the show together.

02:30.442 --> 02:33.445
So... I did.

02:33.486 --> 02:36.406
He climaxed just
as Doña Leticia walked in

02:36.448 --> 02:38.408
on her gardener...

02:38.450 --> 02:39.576
with the sister!

02:39.617 --> 02:40.827
It all happened
at the same time.

02:40.869 --> 02:44.289
It was like those movies in 3D.

02:44.330 --> 02:47.334
[sighs]
And that was the last time.

02:47.375 --> 02:48.626
What about your baby?

02:50.670 --> 02:52.005
My baby needed stuff

02:52.047 --> 02:56.217
and my mother
was often sick so...

02:56.259 --> 02:59.721
I took little things from here,
things I knew he wouldn't miss.

03:02.599 --> 03:03.808
You didn't notice?

03:08.646 --> 03:09.773
No.

03:11.399 --> 03:12.484
You?

03:19.074 --> 03:20.992
I did.

03:21.034 --> 03:24.371
[Inocencia] I already felt so
terrible about abandoning him

03:24.412 --> 03:26.456
that I thought at least
I could give him more chances

03:26.498 --> 03:28.041
than I had when I was little.

03:28.083 --> 03:30.877
The things I stole
paid for school and clothes

03:30.919 --> 03:33.588
and eventually for a little
house my mother bought.

03:33.630 --> 03:36.007
My son was raised
with indoor plumbing,

03:36.049 --> 03:38.593
not like me.

03:38.635 --> 03:39.886
What's his name?

03:39.928 --> 03:41.388
Raimundo.

03:43.932 --> 03:46.643
Raimundo, yeah.

03:49.729 --> 03:52.524
But I call him Secreto.

03:52.565 --> 03:56.027
Because everything about him
has been a secret.

03:56.069 --> 03:59.030
If I got caught,
if I was sent in jail,

03:59.072 --> 04:01.658
at least
I knew in my conscience

04:01.700 --> 04:04.369
I did everything for my family.

04:04.411 --> 04:05.412
For the future.

04:06.955 --> 04:08.832
But...

04:08.873 --> 04:11.292
because of my terrible guilt,
I started drinking.

04:12.752 --> 04:17.632
Once Alba taught me how to read,
I studied the Bible every day,

04:17.674 --> 04:20.427
realizing I'm part
of a very long line

04:20.468 --> 04:23.430
of desperate people
looking for solace.

04:25.098 --> 04:26.975
Only the desperate deserve God.

04:29.102 --> 04:32.981
The ones ashamed enough,
frightened to death.

04:33.023 --> 04:35.650
Hm.
What do you know about that?

04:35.692 --> 04:37.777
[approaching footsteps]

04:37.819 --> 04:39.070
[Sierra] You speak fluent
Spanish, yes?

04:39.112 --> 04:40.989
-Yes.
-[Sierra] Let's go.

04:41.031 --> 04:42.532
What are you going to do to her?

04:42.574 --> 04:44.409
[Sierra]
You ask too many questions.

04:44.451 --> 04:46.369
[footsteps leaving]

04:47.996 --> 04:52.125
[tense music]

04:52.167 --> 04:54.544
[Batty whispers] Alba.

04:54.586 --> 04:56.463
[reporter on TV
speaking Spanish]

04:56.504 --> 04:58.673
[Inocencia]
Authorities are surprised

04:58.715 --> 04:59.632
with the diamond robbery.

05:01.134 --> 05:04.346
The priceless historical gems
valued at 12 million dollars...

05:05.889 --> 05:09.684
They disappeared from
the Lagarto Museum's storage.

05:09.726 --> 05:12.479
The diamonds
traveled from Houston

05:12.520 --> 05:14.481
for a diamond exhibition.

05:14.522 --> 05:17.567
Ramiro Ruiz, the police chief,
didn't have any theories

05:17.609 --> 05:20.362
of how the criminals
pulled it off.

05:20.403 --> 05:23.740
He can't explain it.
They can't believe it.

05:23.782 --> 05:26.451
The building has 24-hour
security guards,

05:26.493 --> 05:28.495
checking entrances and exits,

05:28.536 --> 05:30.121
24-hour camera footage

05:30.163 --> 05:33.166
that cover everything
of the exhibit.

05:33.208 --> 05:35.919
The cabinets...

05:35.960 --> 05:37.754
Uh movements...

05:37.796 --> 05:40.131
Ah, sorry, I didn't get that.

05:40.173 --> 05:41.591
They're looking in the city,

05:41.633 --> 05:43.718
but they don't think
that the thieves

05:43.760 --> 05:45.512
are still in the area.

05:45.553 --> 05:48.473
The jewelry disappeared
Sunday night or Monday morning.

05:48.515 --> 05:50.725
Because the museum
is closed Mondays,

05:50.767 --> 05:53.687
the theft was not found
for almost a day.

05:53.728 --> 05:56.523
It's a big puzzle,
two suspects dressed as police

05:56.564 --> 05:58.525
were found dead

05:58.566 --> 06:00.110
near the scene of the heist.

06:01.695 --> 06:03.488
Coming up next,
very famous weather girl

06:03.530 --> 06:04.406
Marisol Blanca Reyes

06:05.448 --> 06:06.991
reveals her spicy lingerie
for pregnant women.

06:12.205 --> 06:13.456
[knife clangs]

06:13.498 --> 06:14.791
-[Alba] You okay?
-I almost cut a finger off.

06:14.833 --> 06:16.751
[Alba] Shh.

06:16.793 --> 06:18.837
Scoot closer.

06:18.878 --> 06:21.172
-[Batty chuckles]
-What's funny?

06:21.214 --> 06:23.800
-[Batty giggling]
-Shh.

06:23.842 --> 06:27.303
-[Batty giggling]
-Shh. She does this sometimes.

06:27.345 --> 06:28.763
Look at me.

06:28.805 --> 06:31.224
[Batty giggling]

06:31.266 --> 06:33.226
Batty.

06:33.268 --> 06:35.353
Look at me.

06:35.395 --> 06:38.314
[giggling]

06:38.356 --> 06:39.899
You need to settle down.

06:39.941 --> 06:41.359
[giggling]

06:41.401 --> 06:45.196
You do not have
permission to giggle,

06:45.238 --> 06:46.740
understand?

06:49.826 --> 06:51.953
[breathes deeply]

06:56.750 --> 06:58.710
Okay.
Go ahead and cut the rope.

07:03.381 --> 07:06.259
[Malone] Settles one thing:
Clover saved our lives.

07:06.301 --> 07:07.344
[Clover] You're welcome.

07:07.385 --> 07:09.054
[Sierra] Settles something else:

07:09.095 --> 07:11.931
this heat around here
isn't going to die for a while.

07:11.973 --> 07:13.391
[Clover] What if we divvy it up?

07:13.433 --> 07:16.728
A third apiece, split off
in separate directions,

07:16.770 --> 07:18.063
-every man for himself.
-[Sierra] I'm fine with that.

07:18.104 --> 07:19.898
No.
They'll find us.

07:19.939 --> 07:21.816
It always starts with technology
and ends with tracker dogs.

07:21.858 --> 07:25.278
Rogue cops.
Cartel thugs with machetes.

07:25.320 --> 07:28.990
Malone, you're a smart person.

07:29.032 --> 07:30.617
Thank you.

07:30.658 --> 07:31.743
You already know
what you want out of this.

07:31.785 --> 07:32.619
So why don't you just tell us?

07:34.412 --> 07:36.247
I think we should
renegotiate our fee.

07:36.289 --> 07:39.167
-With the Mexicans?
-With Lasalle.

07:39.209 --> 07:40.960
[Sierra] How?

07:41.002 --> 07:42.754
We get him or somebody he sends
to bring us 300 grand.

07:42.796 --> 07:44.381
What's 300 grand
have to do with it?

07:44.422 --> 07:46.132
[Malone] That's what we were
gonna get, a hundred apiece,

07:46.174 --> 07:48.093
for looking the other way
over two dead partners.

07:48.134 --> 07:51.096
Every man for himself.
Am I wrong?

07:51.137 --> 07:52.847
Look, it's not your fault.
And it's not mine.

07:52.889 --> 07:54.724
We learn to live with it.
That's all.

07:54.766 --> 07:56.059
[Clover] I can't learn to live
with it without passports.

07:56.101 --> 07:57.102
Let's not forget.

07:57.143 --> 07:58.853
Look, if Lasalle is after us,

07:58.895 --> 08:00.897
and if he has the Mexican
connections he says he does,

08:00.939 --> 08:02.732
we have no reason
to think that he doesn't,

08:02.774 --> 08:04.943
every two-bit immigration agent
is gonna have a list

08:04.984 --> 08:05.985
with our names on it.

08:06.027 --> 08:07.737
Those passports are burned.

08:07.779 --> 08:10.115
Hold up. Why should we settle
for a hundred each

08:10.156 --> 08:11.783
when the haul's worth
12 million?

08:11.825 --> 08:13.201
The news always says
it's worth more than it is

08:13.243 --> 08:14.744
for the insurance companies.

08:14.786 --> 08:17.163
-So we subtract a third.
-[Clover] A quarter.

08:17.205 --> 08:19.874
[Malone] Okay, let's say
it's nine mil.

08:19.916 --> 08:21.751
But what's that worth
after you fence it?

08:21.793 --> 08:23.962
Lasalle promised the Mexicans
he would get the diamonds.

08:24.004 --> 08:25.797
Now they got nothing.

08:25.839 --> 08:28.049
Which means they gotta find us,
get the diamonds, kill us.

08:28.091 --> 08:30.301
Maybe we kill some of their guys
in the process.

08:30.343 --> 08:33.138
There's a lot of heavy lifting
they got to do all of a sudden.

08:33.179 --> 08:35.098
If I were them,
I'd renegotiate with Lasalle.

08:35.140 --> 08:36.433
Maybe his cut
gets a little smaller

08:36.474 --> 08:38.018
on account of all this hassle.

08:38.059 --> 08:39.894
Wouldn't you?

08:39.936 --> 08:42.022
So now Lasalle's
painted into a corner.

08:42.063 --> 08:43.982
And here I go asking
for only three times

08:44.024 --> 08:45.442
what I was offered.

08:45.483 --> 08:47.318
It's an annoyance to him,
but it won't break the bank.

08:47.360 --> 08:49.279
He'll send a bunch
of cartel guys with machetes.

08:49.320 --> 08:50.155
We're sitting ducks here.

08:50.196 --> 08:51.573
Are we?

08:51.614 --> 08:53.742
We got a pretty good view
of the beach and the road.

08:53.783 --> 08:56.077
So we can see an army of killers
coming from all sides.

08:56.119 --> 08:57.412
Unless we're not in the house.

08:57.454 --> 08:59.831
Where do you suppose we'd be?
Up a fucking tree?

08:59.873 --> 09:00.999
Out on a boat.

09:01.041 --> 09:02.375
We leave the hostages here
as bait.

09:02.417 --> 09:04.085
They deliver the message.

09:04.127 --> 09:05.920
A single man comes out
on the boat with our money,

09:05.962 --> 09:07.047
we make the exchange.

09:07.088 --> 09:09.007
And if they send
everyone after us?

09:09.049 --> 09:11.384
We'd have a head start.

09:11.426 --> 09:14.012
Unless they come by boat.

09:14.054 --> 09:15.513
They come by boat,
we'll improvise.

09:15.555 --> 09:18.099
We'll commandeer their boat
when it offloads the men.

09:20.101 --> 09:22.479
Can I ask a question?

09:22.520 --> 09:23.980
Where do we find a boat?

09:30.528 --> 09:34.074
[knife cutting through ropes]

09:34.115 --> 09:36.368
[Maru] Okay. Okay.

09:36.409 --> 09:37.410
Hey.

09:46.544 --> 09:50.131
[footsteps approaching]

09:59.349 --> 10:00.433
You.

10:11.820 --> 10:13.321
You don't got nothing else?

10:13.363 --> 10:16.908
Most of his clothes
were incinerated in a fire.

10:16.950 --> 10:19.327
-Accidental fire?
-Depends who you ask.

10:21.454 --> 10:25.041
Well, what do you think?

10:25.083 --> 10:27.127
[Alba]
You look like a thug on holiday.

10:27.168 --> 10:29.254
Just the effect I'm going for.

10:29.295 --> 10:31.006
Where's your cell phone?

10:31.047 --> 10:32.924
[Alba] Downstairs.

10:32.966 --> 10:35.135
Do you wanna stay up here,
sitting on the bed?

10:35.176 --> 10:37.178
I want to know how much longer
you're gonna be here.

10:37.220 --> 10:40.265
-We're working on it.
-But longer.

10:40.306 --> 10:42.267
It isn't what any of us
had in mind,

10:42.308 --> 10:44.936
but the town's a hornet's nest
and the hornets are still out.

10:44.978 --> 10:46.563
So do you want to sit
in the tub with the others,

10:46.604 --> 10:48.481
or do you want to rest your tush
on something nice and soft?

10:58.408 --> 11:02.120
[birds chirping]

11:05.498 --> 11:08.251
How did Lasalle
end up owning you?

11:08.293 --> 11:10.337
A guy I thought
I could trust set me up.

11:10.378 --> 11:12.839
You still harboring thoughts
of revenge?

11:12.881 --> 11:15.467
Not since he died, no. You?

11:15.508 --> 11:17.510
Same meat, different gravy.

11:21.514 --> 11:23.892
-Anything?
-Not yet.

11:27.228 --> 11:31.316
[suspenseful music]

11:35.987 --> 11:38.281
So you used to work here?

11:38.323 --> 11:40.408
Yes. A long time.

11:42.535 --> 11:45.872
[window opening]

11:47.457 --> 11:49.626
[clangs]

11:49.668 --> 11:53.963
In the news say
that you killed two policemen.

11:54.005 --> 11:56.966
Two impostors.
And I didn't kill anyone.

11:57.008 --> 11:58.885
[window squeaking]

11:58.927 --> 12:01.137
[Inocencia clears throat]

12:01.179 --> 12:02.222
Thanks.

12:06.726 --> 12:08.019
Sit.

12:09.354 --> 12:12.399
-Your boss is a killer.
-No. He's not my boss.

12:12.440 --> 12:15.235
-No?
-Nuh-uh.

12:15.276 --> 12:19.155
He thinks he's my boss,
I let him think so.

12:36.464 --> 12:39.009
[birds chirping]

12:39.050 --> 12:40.927
-You remember how to find it?
-I can find it,

12:40.969 --> 12:42.721
but I can't
jump-start it, can you?

12:42.762 --> 12:44.264
[Maru] One problem at a time.

12:44.305 --> 12:46.307
We get the ambulance,
we get help,

12:46.349 --> 12:48.268
we save Alba and Inocencia.

12:48.309 --> 12:50.562
We shouldn't have left them
to begin with.

12:50.603 --> 12:52.063
You're a funny bird,
you know that?

12:52.105 --> 12:54.607
That's a natural fact.

12:54.649 --> 12:56.568
What?
Do you see it?

12:56.609 --> 12:58.945
[suspenseful music]

12:58.987 --> 13:01.072
I can't do this.

13:01.114 --> 13:02.365
What are you doing?

13:02.407 --> 13:03.700
Just keep walking straight
and you'll find it.

13:03.742 --> 13:04.701
You can't miss it.

13:04.743 --> 13:07.078
[Maru]
Where are you going? Hey!

13:07.120 --> 13:10.081
[Batty breathing deeply]

13:10.123 --> 13:14.294
[panting]

13:14.336 --> 13:15.545
Shit.

13:20.300 --> 13:25.680
[eerie music]

13:29.434 --> 13:32.062
[Max] Fleeing a sordid affair
with a married man in Paris,

13:32.103 --> 13:33.688
Batista had arrived
in the attractive resort town

13:33.730 --> 13:34.606
of Playa Perdida,

13:35.440 --> 13:36.691
off the coast
of Puerto Vallarta,

13:36.733 --> 13:39.694
intent on becoming
a scuba diver.

13:39.736 --> 13:43.823
This fascination to explore
the stars and beyond is,

13:43.865 --> 13:47.285
I don't know, whimsical to me,
whenever I stand in the ocean

13:47.327 --> 13:48.620
and look down at my feet.

13:48.661 --> 13:50.747
It seems like all
the secrets of the universe

13:50.789 --> 13:52.582
are right here, underwater,

13:52.624 --> 13:54.751
and all we need to explore them
is a mask and oxygen tank.

13:59.464 --> 14:02.217
[soft music]

14:06.888 --> 14:09.808
I want to learn all the secrets
of the universe.

14:25.407 --> 14:27.492
[Max] Her first few forays
underwater were marred

14:27.534 --> 14:30.203
by an acute suffocating
feeling of claustrophobia,

14:30.245 --> 14:32.247
a condition
heretofore unknown to her.

14:37.544 --> 14:40.338
[Batty] What if I panic
and can't breathe underwater?

14:40.380 --> 14:43.216
What if my regulator
falls out of my mouth?

14:43.258 --> 14:46.219
What if my instructor refuses
to let me return to the surface

14:46.261 --> 14:48.346
and holds my hand in hopes
that I will soon be distracted

14:48.388 --> 14:50.640
by the tropical little fish
darting around us,

14:50.682 --> 14:52.809
and the amazing colorful reef,

14:52.851 --> 14:56.229
but instead I start sweating,
suffer muscle tension and pain,

14:56.271 --> 14:58.356
heavy rapid breathing,
dizziness, faintness,

14:58.398 --> 15:00.608
indigestion, and diarrhea?

15:00.650 --> 15:01.818
All of this happened.

15:04.529 --> 15:05.780
[Max] Batista's future

15:05.822 --> 15:08.491
as an underwater explorer
was thus doomed.

15:08.533 --> 15:11.578
[punk rock song playing]

15:14.456 --> 15:15.790
Chapter closed,

15:15.832 --> 15:17.417
she next embarked
on a modeling career.

15:17.459 --> 15:20.795

[camera shutter clicking]

15:42.734 --> 15:47.739
[punk song playing]

15:52.911 --> 15:54.829
But in the peaceful resort
of Playa Perdida,

15:54.871 --> 15:57.290
this amounted to scattered
swimwear catalog work

15:57.332 --> 15:58.458
for local companies,

15:58.500 --> 16:00.543
and a stint as a mannequin model

16:00.585 --> 16:02.337
for a temperamental
local designer.

16:03.880 --> 16:05.924
Stay still!
Stop fucking around!

16:05.965 --> 16:09.010
How many times do I have
to tell you to stay still?

16:09.052 --> 16:11.513
They decided to repurpose
the plexiglass factory

16:11.554 --> 16:12.847
to compete
with the American market

16:12.889 --> 16:14.432
and figured all local stores

16:14.474 --> 16:15.892
would buy cheaper mannequins
if they could.

16:18.770 --> 16:20.313
But they went bankrupt
after casting

16:20.355 --> 16:21.356
their first mannequin.

16:25.610 --> 16:28.697
[Max] When Archibaldo met her,
Batista was working as a hostess

16:28.738 --> 16:30.323
at Maya's Seafood Kitchen,

16:30.365 --> 16:32.575
an upscale restaurant
catering to tourists.

16:32.617 --> 16:34.452
The owner said
I was a natural as a hostess

16:34.494 --> 16:35.995
because I can do
a very quick mental count

16:36.037 --> 16:37.497
upon laying eyes on the party.

16:39.374 --> 16:41.710
Table for three?

16:41.751 --> 16:43.044
Table for five?

16:43.086 --> 16:45.380
Table for six?

16:47.924 --> 16:49.592
But it wasn't very challenging.

16:51.052 --> 16:53.638
I caught myself
staring at the way people ate.

16:53.680 --> 16:56.641
It was pretty disturbing.

16:56.683 --> 16:58.268
You can tell a lot about people,

16:58.309 --> 17:01.021
not only by what they eat,
but by the way they eat it.

17:05.608 --> 17:08.653

17:25.420 --> 17:29.007
[birds chirping]

17:41.436 --> 17:46.649
[whimsical music continues]

18:05.835 --> 18:08.797
[Batty] Life with Archibaldo
was fun at first.

18:08.838 --> 18:12.550
All chunky gold watches
and private airplane rides.

18:12.592 --> 18:14.552
I read somewhere
that it's dangerous to swim

18:14.594 --> 18:16.429
around phosphorescent fish

18:16.471 --> 18:18.473
because sharks are attracted
by the light,

18:18.515 --> 18:20.809
and this really stayed with me.

18:20.850 --> 18:22.727
Seems like my whole life,
I've been swimming

18:22.769 --> 18:24.979
around phosphorescent fish.

18:25.021 --> 18:27.691
I became paranoid
of coconuts falling on my head.

18:27.732 --> 18:29.359
[coconut thuds]

18:29.401 --> 18:31.653
Reading poetry became
my only reason for living.

18:33.029 --> 18:35.490
I hungered for noise
and excitement.

18:35.532 --> 18:38.493
[Mexican drama over TV]

18:40.161 --> 18:41.788
[Inocencia] No.

18:41.830 --> 18:45.458
[Batty] I became a spy.
I spied on Inocencia.

18:45.500 --> 18:46.543
I envied her.

18:48.420 --> 18:49.796
I spied on myself.

19:00.765 --> 19:04.853
The gentle surf
whispered day and night.

19:04.894 --> 19:06.563
The palm trees rustled.

19:09.649 --> 19:12.068
I started getting sick a lot.

19:28.918 --> 19:31.546
I developed narcolepsy.

19:31.588 --> 19:33.173
It can be defined
as an intrusion

19:33.214 --> 19:36.551
by dreaming sleep
into the waking state.

19:36.593 --> 19:38.928
It happens to one
in 2,000 people.

19:41.681 --> 19:42.974
No matter how much sleep I got,

19:43.016 --> 19:46.102
I had an irresistible
urge to sleep.

19:47.812 --> 19:49.647
I would be in the middle
of doing something

19:49.689 --> 19:51.066
and suddenly I'd wake up

19:51.107 --> 19:52.442
and not remember
what I'd been doing.

19:52.484 --> 19:53.568
[thuds]

19:55.862 --> 19:57.822
I became prone to accidents.

[soft music]

20:22.305 --> 20:24.849
"Strange to see all
that was once in place,

20:24.891 --> 20:27.769
floating so loosely in space.

20:27.811 --> 20:31.106
And it's hard being dead,
and full of retrieval

20:31.147 --> 20:34.984
before one gradually feels
a little eternity.

20:35.026 --> 20:36.736
Though the living
all make the error

20:36.778 --> 20:39.239
of drawing too sharp
a distinction.

20:39.280 --> 20:41.950
Angels, they say,
would often not know

20:41.991 --> 20:45.120
whether they moved
among living or dead.

20:45.161 --> 20:48.623
The eternal current
sweeps all the ages within it,

20:48.665 --> 20:50.834
through both the spheres,
forever,

20:50.875 --> 20:53.086
and resounds
above them in both."

20:55.547 --> 20:58.967
One day I spied
Alba leaving my house

20:59.009 --> 21:01.302
and it all came
crashing down for me.

21:01.344 --> 21:03.805
Are you telling me
what I can and cannot do

21:03.847 --> 21:04.973
with my own staff?

21:07.350 --> 21:11.730
-No.
-You are fired. Leave.

21:11.771 --> 21:15.942
[Batty] With Inocencia gone,
I was truly alone in the house.

21:15.984 --> 21:17.110
Archie was never home.

21:18.862 --> 21:21.614
I would lie out in the sun,
trying to soak in nature,

21:21.656 --> 21:23.199
but I was fading fast.

21:26.119 --> 21:27.787
I lost track of time.

21:29.247 --> 21:31.041
I lost track of everything.

[Lasalle] You have reached
Judge Ray Lasalle.

I'm not available
to take your call.

and call my office...

22:54.290 --> 22:55.625
Hi, Ray.

this is an emergency

questioning
your parenting choices.

Why would you ever put me
through piano lessons

23:35.373 --> 23:37.125
when clearly
hot-wiring ambulances

23:37.167 --> 23:39.336
would be a hell
of a fucking lot more useful?
