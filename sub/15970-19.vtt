00:01.880 --> 00:03.440
(Rayanne)
<i>Go now. Go.</i>

00:05.600 --> 00:08.000
(theme music playing)

01:05.160 --> 01:08.640
(upbeat music playing)

01:08.720 --> 01:10.120
(Angela gasps)

01:10.200 --> 01:12.760
(Angela) <i>In the dream I keep having</i>
<i>about Jordan Catalano...</i>

01:13.520 --> 01:14.920
<i>I'm trying to catch up with him.</i>

01:15.000 --> 01:17.320
(mellow music playing)

01:28.680 --> 01:31.720
<i>But it's hard because there's</i>
<i>something wrong with the floor.</i>

01:40.000 --> 01:42.320
<i>Sometimes my father is there.</i>

01:45.520 --> 01:49.240
(dramatic music playing)

01:53.920 --> 01:57.720
<i>Sometimes my great-aunt Gertrude's funeral</i>
<i>kinda gets mixed in with it.</i>

02:14.560 --> 02:16.200
<i>The end of the dream</i>
<i>is always the same.</i>

02:16.960 --> 02:18.440
<i>I catch up with him.</i>

02:19.800 --> 02:23.080
<i>I yell and scream,</i>
<i>how he hurt and betrayed me.</i>

02:24.400 --> 02:26.160
<i>How I can never forgive him.</i>

02:28.400 --> 02:30.040
<i>He just stands there,</i>

02:30.120 --> 02:34.120
<i>like someone caught in a storm</i>
<i>who stopped caring how wet he gets.</i>

02:34.760 --> 02:35.760
<i>Then I wake up.</i>

02:37.240 --> 02:39.600
<i>The storm of words still</i>
<i>pounds through my body.</i>

02:41.080 --> 02:44.600
<i>Hatred can become... like food.</i>

02:44.680 --> 02:46.160
<i>It gives you this energy.</i>

02:46.240 --> 02:49.200
<i>-You can, like... live off it.</i>
-(door squeaks)

02:49.280 --> 02:51.040
Hallie,
I can't discuss this on the phone.

02:51.120 --> 02:52.160
My bagel burned.

02:52.240 --> 02:54.200
Oh, that just reminded
me of my entire dream.

02:54.280 --> 02:55.960
Hey, you unplug that first.

02:56.560 --> 03:00.280
All right. Okay. Bye, I'll meet
you at the space at noon. All right.

03:01.080 --> 03:02.680
The money guys are starting
to waffle.

03:02.760 --> 03:03.920
-Cold feet.
-Really.

03:04.000 --> 03:05.520
Yeah. Well, I say good riddance.

03:05.600 --> 03:07.600
If you can't stand the heat,
get out of the restaurant.

03:07.680 --> 03:09.560
Yeah. Go, Dad.

03:11.000 --> 03:12.880
Listen, everyone.
You wanna hear what I dreamed?

03:12.960 --> 03:14.600
-Oh.
-(cutlery clinking)

03:14.680 --> 03:16.200
-Maybe later.
-No, thanks.

03:16.280 --> 03:18.280
Dad, something is really wrong
with that toaster.

03:18.360 --> 03:21.400
-Where's my other mitten?
-I know. Here, finish my bagel.

03:21.480 --> 03:22.920
That's okay. I'm not hungry.

03:23.000 --> 03:25.440
-(door opens)
-I dreamed about Tony Poole.

03:25.520 --> 03:26.560
(Sharon) Seriously?

03:26.640 --> 03:30.320
You had a dream about
Rickie Vasquez?

03:31.000 --> 03:33.320
Well, it wasn't, you know,
that type of dream.

03:34.480 --> 03:35.680
We were just dancing.

03:36.360 --> 03:39.600
In this... big vegetable garden.

03:40.280 --> 03:42.640
I was wearing this dress
I saw on <i>the Nanny. </i>(laughs)

03:44.160 --> 03:47.240
So... how much do you,
like, know about him?

03:49.520 --> 03:52.320
Rickie Vasquez. Nothing.

03:53.160 --> 03:55.320
But he's best friends
with Rayanne Graff.

03:55.400 --> 03:57.200
And you're, like,
friends with her, aren't you?

03:57.280 --> 03:58.640
I'm not friends with Rayanne Graff.

03:59.800 --> 04:00.920
I'm not!

04:03.360 --> 04:04.880
-I can't believe this.
-Okay, just...

04:04.960 --> 04:06.560
I can't believe you didn't
tell me immediately.

04:06.640 --> 04:09.080
I'm telling you now.
Hey, it's a bump in the road.

04:09.160 --> 04:11.000
Excuse me? It's a little more
than a bump in the road

04:11.080 --> 04:13.240
if our potential investors
want me out of the picture.

04:13.320 --> 04:15.480
They're insecure, okay?
It's normal!

04:15.560 --> 04:19.360
Yeah, well, you should've mentioned it
three days ago when it first came up.

04:21.160 --> 04:23.160
-Hello.
-Hi.

04:23.240 --> 04:25.400
Hi. I brought lunch.

04:27.680 --> 04:28.840
That's great. Good.

04:30.800 --> 04:33.640
I'm gonna go out... for a while
and get some air.

04:35.400 --> 04:38.320
(door opens and closes)

04:40.240 --> 04:42.960
He's completely right.
I should've told him the second I knew.

04:43.560 --> 04:47.320
(sighs) I mean, it's unorthodox, you know.
He's never actually worked as a chef.

04:47.400 --> 04:48.880
True.

04:48.960 --> 04:50.080
He just has to cook for them.

04:50.160 --> 04:52.640
That's all.
They'll be eating out of his hand.

04:52.720 --> 04:56.920
(sighs) Well, better get back
to the office before they fire me.

04:57.520 --> 05:00.080
You know, um, it occurred
to me this morning.

05:00.160 --> 05:03.600
Um, an old friend of mine from high school
ended up in the restaurant business.

05:03.680 --> 05:07.840
-Oh, yeah?
-Well, an old boyfriend, actually.

05:07.920 --> 05:10.440
I'm pretty sure that he ended up
running a bar and grill.

05:10.520 --> 05:13.680
-Anyway, I'd be happy to contact him.
-Why?

05:13.760 --> 05:15.960
Just... I don't know.

05:16.040 --> 05:18.960
Maybe it would help to talk
to somebody who's been through it.

05:19.560 --> 05:23.480
Oh. Uh, yeah, sure.
I'll talk to anybody.

05:23.560 --> 05:26.840
-(door opens and closes)
-All right, here's the deal.

05:27.440 --> 05:30.280
Tasting is believing.
My cooking speaks for itself.

05:30.360 --> 05:32.680
All right? I have to do what
I do best, which is cook.

05:33.600 --> 05:38.040
So I'll cook for these money guys.
And that will be that... right?

05:39.360 --> 05:40.160
-Right.
-Right.

05:41.680 --> 05:42.680
Right.

05:45.640 --> 05:49.760
Okay. Once again,
each of the vocabulary words...

05:50.720 --> 05:56.400
preferably spelled correctly,
must be used in a sentence.

05:56.480 --> 06:00.000
Anyone who would like to read
more about Grecian Urns

06:00.080 --> 06:03.160
for extra credit
should speak to me right now.

06:03.240 --> 06:04.760
(bell rings)

06:05.560 --> 06:09.680
(indistinct chatter)

06:12.080 --> 06:15.200
(Angela) <i>It's so weird when you see</i>
<i>someone you just dreamed about.</i>

06:15.280 --> 06:16.920
<i>Like it's gonna show.</i>

06:19.640 --> 06:22.000
I'm gonna go do that
extra credit thing.

06:26.000 --> 06:28.400
I can't believe we have to use
all those words in a sentence.

06:30.800 --> 06:33.280
I mean, not all in
the same sentence, but, uh...

06:35.240 --> 06:36.240
still.

06:38.560 --> 06:40.480
So, I'm still doing
that tutoring thing.

06:41.160 --> 06:42.160
You know?

06:44.640 --> 06:46.040
Yeah.

06:47.880 --> 06:51.200
So guess what? Uh...
there's, like, a term for me.

06:52.360 --> 06:56.160
I'm a rudimentary reader
with low literacy skills.

06:56.960 --> 07:00.240
That kid, Brain,
figured it out from this manual.

07:00.320 --> 07:02.440
(Katimsky) should I check to see
if I have a few more copies?

07:02.520 --> 07:04.680
I'll do it, yes.
I'll be with you in one second.

07:07.480 --> 07:10.040
So, how's everything?
How's Delia Fisher?

07:10.840 --> 07:13.520
Krakow,
stop asking me how she is.

07:13.600 --> 07:17.520
You treated her like crap, and she is
way over you. She likes someone else now.

07:18.680 --> 07:20.120
Oh, yeah. Who?

07:21.640 --> 07:24.480
That guy Angela hangs out with.
Rickie Vasquez.

07:25.000 --> 07:27.720
-What?
-Uh, what else?

07:29.920 --> 07:31.480
Oh, my band got back together.

07:33.640 --> 07:36.080
We got a new name. We're, uh...

07:36.920 --> 07:38.600
we're residue now.

07:40.440 --> 07:41.880
So, I've been, you know,
writing songs...

07:41.960 --> 07:43.360
Why are you telling me all this?

07:45.280 --> 07:46.360
I don't know.

07:47.600 --> 07:51.120
I mean, you're the one who signed me up
for tutoring in the first place, so...

07:54.400 --> 07:55.800
Forget it.

07:57.200 --> 08:00.560
He had the nerve to, like, talk
to you? I don't believe him.

08:00.640 --> 08:02.640
-(Angela sighs)
-(Sharon scoffs)

08:03.440 --> 08:05.880
Oh, Chase-face,
you're, like, shaking.

08:12.360 --> 08:15.360
(sighs) I had that dream
again last night.

08:15.440 --> 08:17.080
Where I'm, like, screaming
at him.

08:17.160 --> 08:19.200
Oh! I just remember
what I dreamed.

08:19.280 --> 08:20.720
Angela Chase?

08:20.800 --> 08:23.600
Can I put you down to sell
30 tickets to <i>Our Town?</i>

08:24.720 --> 08:27.840
Oh, gee whiz, Angela!
It's 30 measly tickets.

08:27.920 --> 08:31.000
-Okay. Yes.
-(laughs) Great.

08:31.680 --> 08:33.520
God, he just wears you down.

08:33.600 --> 08:36.720
Last night I dreamed that Rayanne Graff

08:36.800 --> 08:40.080
and I were appearing
in this water ballet together.

08:40.160 --> 08:41.800
For, like, charity.

08:42.960 --> 08:45.040
Okay. Um, here's how we do it.

08:45.120 --> 08:48.480
You tell me a story, a true story
that happened, like, to you.

08:48.560 --> 08:52.880
And, um, I take certain, like, key words
from the story and make flash cards.

08:52.960 --> 08:54.040
I blew it.

08:54.960 --> 08:56.640
Wait. Is this, like, the story,
or is this just...

08:56.720 --> 09:00.960
Forget the story. I can't think about
some crappy story. My life sucks too much.

09:03.480 --> 09:04.560
Yeah. How come?

09:06.480 --> 09:09.680
(sighs) 'Cause... she hates me.

09:10.720 --> 09:13.480
And... I deserve it.

09:15.920 --> 09:18.280
-You know who I mean, right?
-Yeah.

09:19.760 --> 09:21.640
Today, after Katimsky's...

09:22.440 --> 09:24.200
I tried to explain to her...

09:25.760 --> 09:26.680
that I was...

09:28.000 --> 09:31.840
you know... sorry. Whatever.

09:32.960 --> 09:36.600
-So... what happened?
-Nothing.

09:39.000 --> 09:42.000
-I didn't know what to say.
-Say you're sorry.

09:47.880 --> 09:49.720
You can go up to any girl
and get her phone number,

09:49.800 --> 09:51.560
yet you're afraid to tell
Angela Chase you're sorry?

09:51.640 --> 09:52.600
So?

09:52.680 --> 09:55.160
-Nothing, it's just ironic.
-Well, so what?

09:58.600 --> 10:00.000
What's ironic?

10:02.200 --> 10:07.440
When you... realize the, like,
component of weirdness in a situation.

10:09.680 --> 10:10.920
Help me, Brain.

10:11.000 --> 10:13.560
Help me figure out something good
to say to Angela.

10:13.640 --> 10:15.680
No. Uh-uh. No.

10:16.240 --> 10:18.640
Look, you did an undefendable
thing, okay?

10:18.720 --> 10:20.240
No one can change that.

10:20.320 --> 10:22.000
I mean...
you have to live with it.

10:22.080 --> 10:24.800
It's like you created your own prison
and now you have to exist in it.

10:25.520 --> 10:26.560
That's perfect.

10:27.720 --> 10:28.800
Give me more stuff like that.

10:28.880 --> 10:31.760
-No! No! Absolutely not! It's not...
-(shushing)

10:31.840 --> 10:34.400
The phonics manual does not cover
that type of situation, okay?

10:34.480 --> 10:35.600
Phonics manual?

10:37.520 --> 10:39.640
I cannot be involved.

10:39.720 --> 10:45.880
Whatever you say or don't say to Angela
Chase is completely between you and her.

10:47.560 --> 10:48.560
Okay.

10:50.400 --> 10:52.600
Relax...
I'll figure it out myself.

10:52.680 --> 10:56.680
Fine...
That's actually fine with me.

10:56.760 --> 11:00.720
-Good.
-You figure out what you wanna say to her,

11:00.800 --> 11:03.800
and I'll do some calculus,
and we'll just work independently.

11:04.400 --> 11:05.560
Deal.

11:11.520 --> 11:12.760
What've you got so far?

11:16.280 --> 11:19.040
Hah. You think I'm unhappy? Me?

11:19.120 --> 11:21.160
Well, in my humble opinion, yes.

11:21.240 --> 11:23.800
Don't say, "In my humble opinion."

11:23.880 --> 11:26.120
That's Angela talk.
That's how Angela Chase talks.

11:26.200 --> 11:27.840
What, are you
trying to depress me?

11:27.920 --> 11:29.400
For your information,

11:29.480 --> 11:33.000
I happen to be a very happy,
up... person.

11:33.640 --> 11:35.400
-What are you looking at?
-Nothing.

11:37.160 --> 11:40.680
Ignore her. She's just
a naturally happy, up person.

11:40.760 --> 11:43.080
Oh, by the way, I put you down
to sell <i>Our Town</i> tickets.

11:43.160 --> 11:44.640
No, don't put me down.
Take me off.

11:44.720 --> 11:47.120
-I have, like, no free time as it is.
-Rickie?

11:49.080 --> 11:50.680
-Hi.
-Hi.

11:51.880 --> 11:53.240
You're working on
<i>Our Town, </i>right?

11:53.320 --> 11:57.040
Oh, yeah. He's the stage manager.
I mean, not the part of the stage manager,

11:57.120 --> 11:58.200
but the actual...

11:58.280 --> 12:00.440
Well, you know, I would
really like to get involved.

12:00.520 --> 12:02.400
With the play, I mean.

12:02.480 --> 12:04.960
Oh, okay. Well, we need more
people to sell tickets.

12:05.040 --> 12:07.280
-Great, sign me up.
-Me, too.

12:08.320 --> 12:11.360
Okay. Well, um, I'll let you guys know
where you can pick them up and everything.

12:11.440 --> 12:13.280
Good. Bye.

12:15.520 --> 12:16.840
Bye. (chuckles)

12:16.920 --> 12:19.400
-Ow. What? Stop it.
-Oh, you know what.

12:20.720 --> 12:25.120
So, Sharon Cherski told me
that Delia has it for you.

12:26.960 --> 12:29.760
-Has it for me?
-What? That's, like, an expression.

12:29.840 --> 12:31.480
People say it, right?

12:33.360 --> 12:34.440
Right?

12:35.160 --> 12:36.160
Yeah.

12:36.240 --> 12:38.600
-(indistinct chatter)
-(footsteps receding)

12:40.080 --> 12:42.520
(chuckles) Tony!

12:42.600 --> 12:44.520
-I did not!
-Tony?

12:44.600 --> 12:46.440
Camille Cherski
gave me your number.

12:47.320 --> 12:52.360
(laughs) Okay. She got it
from Howard Pickett at the last reunion.

12:52.440 --> 12:56.440
Because, I already told you.
I need your advice.

12:57.880 --> 13:00.040
(chuckles) Okay. Me, too.

13:00.640 --> 13:02.640
I'll see you Friday. (chuckles)

13:04.360 --> 13:06.480
-(door opens)
-(gasps) Oh, God!

13:06.560 --> 13:07.960
Don't sneak up on me like that.

13:08.040 --> 13:09.520
-Mom...
-Mom, who's Tony?

13:09.600 --> 13:11.640
-Mom, why are you blushing?
-Mom, do you realize

13:11.720 --> 13:15.080
that your voice just sounded,
like, really different?

13:16.240 --> 13:17.240
Really?

13:19.880 --> 13:22.880
Oh, my God, mom. He's cute.

13:22.960 --> 13:24.240
I told you so.

13:24.320 --> 13:26.840
Yeah, but I can't trust your
judgement on cuteness.

13:28.360 --> 13:30.360
Mom, you went hitchhiking?

13:31.120 --> 13:35.200
No. No. That is a totally fake
picture. That never happened.

13:35.280 --> 13:38.600
And if either of you girls
ever attempt such a thing.

13:38.680 --> 13:41.120
Mom, you really haven't
seen him since high school?

13:41.200 --> 13:43.520
Oh, I haven't even
thought about him in years.

13:45.120 --> 13:47.240
I had a dream about him
last night.

13:48.680 --> 13:52.320
I dreamed I was taking
out the garbage...

13:53.080 --> 13:56.040
and suddenly I realize
there's someone there.

13:56.120 --> 13:58.120
And it's princess Diana.

13:59.080 --> 14:01.360
(Angela) Not another
princess Diana dream.

14:01.440 --> 14:03.600
(Danielle) Why does mom dream about
her a lot or something?

14:03.680 --> 14:05.360
(Patty) Not that often.

14:05.440 --> 14:10.360
Anyway... anyway, she's all upset about
the divorce and everything.

14:10.440 --> 14:14.800
And she keeps repeating,
"Princesses just don't get divorced."

14:14.880 --> 14:19.440
And I say, "I know. I know."
And... then I see him.

14:20.720 --> 14:21.840
Tony.

14:22.320 --> 14:23.960
And I think...

14:24.040 --> 14:28.040
wow... he looks just the same.

14:29.120 --> 14:30.280
And...

14:30.360 --> 14:32.520
(dramatic music playing)

14:41.880 --> 14:43.480
that's all I remember.

14:44.040 --> 14:46.200
So, do you love him
more than you love dad?

14:46.280 --> 14:47.280
Danielle.

14:47.920 --> 14:50.600
-No, honey. That's okay.
-No, it's a ridiculous question.

14:50.680 --> 14:53.440
-That kind of thing gives me nightmares.
-What kind of thing?

14:54.200 --> 14:55.960
That you and daddy
could get divorced.

14:56.040 --> 14:59.240
Danielle, she's gonna see him
for one hour to talk about restaurants.

14:59.320 --> 15:00.440
Angela.

15:00.520 --> 15:04.640
Well... I mean, a person can have feelings
for someone even if they're not, like...

15:06.280 --> 15:08.040
the person anymore.

15:10.680 --> 15:15.480
Sweetie... Tony Poole is someone
that I knew long, long ago.

15:15.560 --> 15:17.280
Long, long ago.

15:18.240 --> 15:19.880
-Like a fairy-tale.
-That's right.

15:19.960 --> 15:22.600
But he's not who I chose
to make my life with.

15:23.160 --> 15:24.440
I chose your dad.

15:26.440 --> 15:28.280
But did you, like, love him?

15:30.440 --> 15:32.280
I'm not sure.

15:32.880 --> 15:35.920
With Tony, it was...
it was crazy.

15:36.440 --> 15:42.280
We really did some...
pretty crazy and wild things back then.

15:43.000 --> 15:44.360
I did!

15:45.040 --> 15:47.080
What can I say, but, uh...

15:48.240 --> 15:53.120
it's always tempting to...
lose yourself with someone...

15:54.520 --> 15:56.520
who's maybe lost themselves.

15:58.080 --> 15:59.160
But eventually...

16:00.400 --> 16:03.240
(sighs) You want reality.

16:03.760 --> 16:05.480
That makes sense.

16:06.520 --> 16:08.360
-(door opens)
-I'm home.

16:08.920 --> 16:11.360
-(door squeaks)
-(keys jingle)

16:14.200 --> 16:17.200
-So, I called Tony Poole this evening.
-Really?

16:17.280 --> 16:19.640
-Boy, was he shocked.
-Yeah, well, I bet.

16:19.720 --> 16:22.920
Well, it was no big deal. Believe me.
His wife answered the phone.

16:24.000 --> 16:28.360
Anyway, it turns out that he was in the
restaurant business for, like, 12 years.

16:28.440 --> 16:29.960
Where is he now, prison?

16:30.040 --> 16:32.560
He has a jeep dealership
in Harrisburg.

16:33.200 --> 16:37.440
So, um, I invited him to
stop by on Friday night,

16:37.520 --> 16:40.320
just in case he has some pearls
of wisdom to dispense.

16:41.200 --> 16:44.200
-Unless... I mean, is that okay?
-Of course, it's okay.

16:44.280 --> 16:46.880
It's probably a good idea to get other
people's experiences who've been there.

16:46.960 --> 16:48.840
-Yeah, exactly.
-I won't be here, though.

16:49.560 --> 16:51.800
I'm cooking for the investors
on Friday night.

16:53.040 --> 16:54.120
Oh.

16:54.920 --> 16:57.560
She dreamed about Rickie?
My Rickie?

16:58.360 --> 17:04.200
So, what do you think? I mean,
does he ever, you know, with girls?

17:04.280 --> 17:07.280
-'Cause she is a real sweetie.
-(toilet flushes)

17:08.400 --> 17:11.920
-(bell rings)
-I thought she, like, craved Brian Krakow.

17:13.080 --> 17:16.360
(indistinct chatter)

17:25.560 --> 17:27.880
Come on,
you'll be late for home room.

17:29.720 --> 17:30.720
Okay, let me see.

17:30.800 --> 17:33.840
-That thing about the prison...
-Just beg her forgiveness.

17:33.920 --> 17:36.560
I mean, tell her you're scum.
That you're lower than scum.

17:36.640 --> 17:38.960
That you're not fit
to lick her shoes.

17:39.600 --> 17:42.120
I'm sorry. I didn't mean
to get insulting, I just...

17:42.200 --> 17:44.600
What about that other thing
you said your parents always say?

17:44.680 --> 17:47.000
My parents are psychiatrists, okay?
You can't go by them.

17:47.080 --> 17:49.640
A... what kind of wish?

17:51.000 --> 17:55.200
Unconscious wish...
to punish you. I mean her.

17:56.000 --> 17:57.880
-Got it.
-(Sharon) Angela, come on.

17:57.960 --> 17:59.400
Angela?

18:02.920 --> 18:04.520
I'm gonna be late for home room.

18:06.160 --> 18:07.320
What?

18:09.960 --> 18:11.800
I did an undefendable thing.

18:11.880 --> 18:14.400
(indistinct chatter)

18:16.920 --> 18:18.840
I created my own prison...

18:21.440 --> 18:22.880
and I have to exist in it.

18:24.600 --> 18:26.280
Maybe I had a...

18:27.760 --> 18:28.760
wish.

18:30.280 --> 18:31.560
Or whatever.

18:32.760 --> 18:33.920
To punish you.

18:35.560 --> 18:37.240
An unconscious wish.

18:38.800 --> 18:40.520
You've heard of them, right?

18:41.880 --> 18:43.160
No, I think so.

18:45.520 --> 18:46.760
I can't believe.

18:48.360 --> 18:50.200
What you just said was...

18:51.440 --> 18:53.240
really amazing.

18:55.320 --> 18:56.640
I know.

18:57.680 --> 18:58.720
Okay.

19:00.600 --> 19:01.720
Okay, what?

19:01.800 --> 19:03.960
Okay, now we can
have a serious talk.

19:05.640 --> 19:06.720
We just did.

19:06.800 --> 19:10.200
Oh, come on. You can't hit a person
with something that profound

19:10.280 --> 19:12.480
and expect that to be the end
of the discussion.

19:12.560 --> 19:13.960
You can't?

19:15.000 --> 19:19.520
Oh, uh, I forgot.
I, uh, I'm late for home room.

19:20.240 --> 19:23.360
(mellow music playing)

19:30.880 --> 19:34.080
-(door closes)
-(Brian sighs)

19:44.440 --> 19:50.760
-(serene music playing)
-(indistinct chatter)

19:52.000 --> 19:53.920
I was so close yesterday.

19:54.920 --> 19:56.240
But it wasn't enough.

19:58.840 --> 20:02.320
She's, like... starved or something.

20:05.400 --> 20:08.040
It's gotta be written down
so I can't screw it up.

20:08.120 --> 20:09.560
Well, so, write her a letter.

20:13.320 --> 20:14.560
No.

20:15.160 --> 20:18.840
No, I am not writing a letter
to Angela Chase for you. I can't.

20:24.080 --> 20:26.240
Oh, Rickie, it was like a dream.

20:26.320 --> 20:29.440
You would not believe
the brilliantly insightful words

20:29.520 --> 20:30.560
that came out of his mouth.

20:31.360 --> 20:33.600
-Go ahead, I'm listening.
-And then, just...

20:34.200 --> 20:38.200
just as I'm realizing that there's hope
that we could actually communicate,

20:38.280 --> 20:39.320
he runs away.

20:40.520 --> 20:44.160
I mean, I have never been
so completely and totally...

20:44.240 --> 20:45.320
Oh, are those the posters?

20:46.360 --> 20:49.080
-Uh, yeah.
-Can I take one home to show Amber?

20:49.160 --> 20:50.200
Sure.

20:52.840 --> 20:54.360
Amber's, like, totally jazzed.

20:54.440 --> 20:57.160
It turns out it's, like, her big dream
to have a daughter in the school play.

20:57.240 --> 20:58.360
Oh, really?

21:02.600 --> 21:03.960
I better go.

21:04.040 --> 21:06.400
(indistinct chatter)

21:16.200 --> 21:17.600
Get out of my way.

21:20.240 --> 21:22.520
Why does she dislike me?
What have I ever done to her?

21:23.880 --> 21:25.480
So, what's new?

21:26.880 --> 21:32.440
I mean, is anything, like, new with
anybody we both, like, know or anything?

21:32.520 --> 21:36.400
Well, if you must know, she's in shock.

21:37.360 --> 21:39.040
Once again,
something Jordan Catalano did

21:39.120 --> 21:41.600
has left her completely
and totally mystified.

21:44.160 --> 21:46.680
It was me. I mean...

21:48.520 --> 21:50.880
I told Jordan what to say.

21:52.000 --> 21:52.800
What?

21:52.880 --> 21:55.400
I can't, like, defend it,
it's undefendable.

21:56.080 --> 21:58.520
Brian, I don't believe this.
You're using Jordan Catalano.

21:58.600 --> 22:02.520
-What? He's using me.
-Yeah, but you're using him, too.

22:03.080 --> 22:05.720
To, like, express your true feelings
toward Angela.

22:08.680 --> 22:09.720
Or whatever.

22:10.960 --> 22:12.560
Oh, my God. You're right.

22:13.560 --> 22:14.640
(Delia) careful.

22:15.760 --> 22:17.480
Someone could step on 'em.

22:19.160 --> 22:21.440
-Thanks.
-Delia, come on.

22:21.960 --> 22:25.480
So, don't forget.
Put me down to sell tickets.

22:30.880 --> 22:34.600
-Boy, she really likes you.
-(Rickie chuckles)

22:35.800 --> 22:37.560
I can't even believe it.

22:37.640 --> 22:41.600
I mean, it's such, like,
an unfamiliar experience.

22:42.200 --> 22:44.280
I mean, do you realize

22:44.360 --> 22:48.680
how much easier my life would be
if I could just like her back?

22:50.520 --> 22:53.480
Hey, Brian...
this could be my chance.

22:55.280 --> 22:56.440
To be straight.

23:00.400 --> 23:01.640
Okay.

23:01.720 --> 23:05.280
So are we agreed on the rack of lamb
with the green peppercorn sauce?

23:05.360 --> 23:06.360
No, come on.

23:06.440 --> 23:09.040
Come on, it's compatible
with the sauteed foie gras.

23:09.120 --> 23:10.240
We know we want
the crème brûlée.

23:10.320 --> 23:14.160
Okay, fine. Lamb.
Listen, I spoke with Alexander.

23:14.800 --> 23:16.560
He's gonna come up
with some visual aids,

23:16.640 --> 23:17.840
to give 'em something to picture.

23:17.920 --> 23:18.720
Great.

23:18.800 --> 23:22.880
So, it's messieurs moneybags,
plus their significant others,

23:22.960 --> 23:24.720
plus... oh. Is Patty coming?

23:24.800 --> 23:26.280
No. No.

23:26.360 --> 23:29.040
It's just as well, though.
Makes me less nervous.

23:29.120 --> 23:32.440
Actually, she's having that guy
Tony over to the house that night.

23:32.520 --> 23:34.320
You know, the old
boyfriend from high school.

23:35.080 --> 23:36.680
She'll grill him about
the restaurant business.

23:36.760 --> 23:38.200
(Hallie chuckles)

23:39.480 --> 23:41.160
I think she's kind of curious.

23:42.600 --> 23:45.680
He meant a lot to her
at a certain time in her life.

23:45.760 --> 23:48.120
-I mean, it's okay. I can handle it.
-Clearly.

23:49.480 --> 23:54.360
No. Let's say they even...
flirt a little or whatever,

23:54.440 --> 23:56.480
-I mean, that doesn't mean...
-Uh, yeah. I know.

23:56.560 --> 24:00.560
A person can enjoy the
enjoyment of flirting without...

24:00.640 --> 24:02.000
Exactly.
Without any intentional...

24:02.080 --> 24:04.280
-any necessarily...
-...you don't mean anything.

24:04.360 --> 24:06.440
Well, everything means
something, you know, but...

24:06.520 --> 24:08.800
Right. Exactly.

24:11.480 --> 24:14.880
Of course, there's no law
that says you can't act jealous.

24:15.480 --> 24:16.440
What?

24:17.120 --> 24:18.440
No. Come on.

24:19.240 --> 24:22.480
-We don't play games like that.
-I don't call that a game.

24:22.560 --> 24:23.800
Well, what do you call it?

24:25.320 --> 24:26.400
Considerate.

24:29.960 --> 24:33.040
-Hmm!
-Hmm.

24:34.440 --> 24:37.240
(dramatic music playing)

25:01.120 --> 25:02.120
(Brian)<i> "Dear Angela...</i>

25:02.920 --> 25:04.760
<i>I know in the past</i>
<i>I've caused you pain...</i>

25:05.520 --> 25:06.640
<i>and I'm sorry."</i>

25:06.720 --> 25:10.280
(dramatic music playing)

25:16.360 --> 25:18.920
(Brian)<i> "And I'll always be sorry</i>

25:21.920 --> 25:25.280
<i>And I hate this pen I'm holding</i>
<i>because I should be holding you.</i>

25:28.480 --> 25:31.520
<i>I hate this paper under my hand</i>
<i>because it isn't you.</i>

25:33.760 --> 25:36.280
<i>I even hate this letter because</i>

25:38.840 --> 25:44.800
<i>Because the whole truth is... so much</i>

25:51.800 --> 25:53.240

25:54.400 --> 25:56.960

<i>Sincerely, Jordan Catalano."</i>

26:16.400 --> 26:19.520
(indistinct chatter)

26:23.240 --> 26:25.960
-Which one, the biology paper?
-Yeah.

26:27.040 --> 26:28.040
Hey.

26:28.120 --> 26:29.440
-Oh, hi.
-What're you reading?

26:30.880 --> 26:35.120
Have you ever just, like, completely given
up on someone and then something happens

26:35.200 --> 26:37.960
and you go, "Oh, my God.

26:38.040 --> 26:41.160
There's so much more to this person
than I ever dreamed."

26:45.480 --> 26:47.080
Hey, keep it moving.

26:47.160 --> 26:49.080
So you got this letter
from Jordan Catalano.

26:49.160 --> 26:50.360
It's not just this letter.

26:50.440 --> 26:54.760
It's... like, the most incredible letter
I've ever gotten ever.

26:55.600 --> 26:57.640
Boy, you must've
really worked hard.

26:58.360 --> 27:02.160
I mean tutoring him.
I mean, I really, I should thank you.

27:02.240 --> 27:04.080
It's obviously made
a real difference.

27:06.240 --> 27:08.000
So, what was your favorite part?

27:08.080 --> 27:11.000
When you were reading it, was there,
like, a certain part that made you...

27:11.080 --> 27:14.560
Brian, I'm sorry. It's... too personal.

27:14.640 --> 27:15.920
(car door closes)

27:17.640 --> 27:19.200
Oh, my God.

27:21.960 --> 27:23.200
I gotta go.

27:23.280 --> 27:26.040
-(indistinct chatter)
-(birds chirping)

27:28.000 --> 27:30.160
(bell rings)

27:35.560 --> 27:36.880
I read what you wrote.

27:37.840 --> 27:39.360
-I could hardly...
-Look...

27:39.440 --> 27:41.720
I could hardly believe
how beautiful it was.

27:41.800 --> 27:42.880
Look, I'm not...

27:43.480 --> 27:44.920
I don't wanna pretend like...

27:45.000 --> 27:47.400
No, I don't...
I don't wanna pretend either.

27:48.920 --> 27:52.040
-I'm glad you liked it, but...
-I didn't like it.

27:53.560 --> 27:55.000
I loved it.

27:58.560 --> 27:59.760
I loved it.

28:01.880 --> 28:05.480
(sighs)
I have all these dreams...

28:07.400 --> 28:09.520
where I know exactly what to say.

28:13.080 --> 28:15.320
And you tell me... you know...

28:16.760 --> 28:18.040
that you forgive me.

28:18.120 --> 28:20.440
(somber music playing)

28:36.040 --> 28:38.520
(upbeat music playing)

28:54.520 --> 28:56.680
(serene music playing)

29:01.240 --> 29:02.360
Brian.

29:02.960 --> 29:04.960
Brian. If you still want
to sell <i>Our Town</i> tickets,

29:05.040 --> 29:08.440
everyone has to pick them up tonight
at our place. I... I mean, Mr. Katimsky's.

29:11.120 --> 29:13.800
-Oh, so they're back together, huh?
-Yep.

29:15.400 --> 29:18.840
Of course, she's still gonna die someday.
We're all gonna die.

29:18.920 --> 29:20.160
(slams locker)

29:21.880 --> 29:22.920
Brian?

29:23.000 --> 29:27.080
Did you do something, or something?
Brian, what did you do?

29:27.840 --> 29:32.880
(sighs)
I wrote this letter... to her.

29:34.320 --> 29:37.560
Oh, my God...
and she thinks he wrote it?

29:39.000 --> 29:41.160
-Brian, you have to tell her.
-No, look.

29:42.120 --> 29:44.400
What difference does it make?
So, they happen to be, like, together.

29:44.480 --> 29:46.080
-So, what?
-So, what?

29:46.160 --> 29:49.360
I mean, if you, like, analyze why certain
people end up with certain other people,

29:49.440 --> 29:51.320
it'll make you want to kill
yourself.

29:51.400 --> 29:53.040
(Rickie, Brian sighs)

29:54.480 --> 29:55.880
Tell her.

29:58.120 --> 29:59.680
No, it wouldn't be right.

30:01.920 --> 30:03.440
See, he asked me for help.

30:04.440 --> 30:06.280
I helped him.
I can't go back on that.

30:06.360 --> 30:07.920
(indistinct chatter)

30:15.960 --> 30:19.080
Darn it... got a run!

30:20.760 --> 30:24.560
Wanna know something really...
laughable?

30:25.280 --> 30:30.280
I have no friends.
I mean, Angela Chase.

30:31.640 --> 30:33.800
Forget it, we obviously
cannot discuss that.

30:34.400 --> 30:37.160
Rickie Vasquez.
Totally not my friend.

30:37.240 --> 30:42.600
-Tino... not dependable.
-(toilet flushes)

30:42.680 --> 30:46.560
You're probably thinkin'...
"So what?

30:46.640 --> 30:48.960
You, like, deserve
to have no friends."

30:49.600 --> 30:51.960
I mean, that is what
you're thinking, isn't it?

30:52.800 --> 30:53.600
(scoffs)

30:54.840 --> 30:58.400
I have never met anyone
like you, you know.

30:58.480 --> 31:04.360
You will say anything, and a person...
can say anything to you.

31:04.440 --> 31:06.680
You're just... like...

31:08.120 --> 31:11.560
non-shockable... or something.

31:12.120 --> 31:15.600
-It's kind of...
-It's refreshing, isn't it?

31:18.440 --> 31:22.520
Yeah... it is kind of... refreshing.

31:24.440 --> 31:25.720
Refreshing.

31:26.920 --> 31:30.920
So you do... have a friend.

31:31.000 --> 31:34.840
I mean... maybe not the one
you want...

31:35.640 --> 31:37.000
but...

31:39.680 --> 31:43.960
(sighs deeply) I screwed up.

31:48.600 --> 31:50.320
Duh squared.

32:00.320 --> 32:02.400
-Angela!
-(Angela) In a minute.

32:02.480 --> 32:03.480
Let me get the door for you.

32:03.560 --> 32:06.400
I'm gonna drop her at Katimsky's.
She's up in the stratosphere today.

32:06.480 --> 32:08.560
Hey, you know, um,
if you want me to come,

32:08.640 --> 32:12.480
-I could call Tony and cancel.
-Oh, no, that's fine. Honest.

32:14.640 --> 32:15.960
Well, see ya.

32:22.560 --> 32:25.200
You know, like,
accept checks and stuff?

32:25.280 --> 32:28.960
-Um, here's... here's all the information.
-Thanks.

32:29.040 --> 32:30.440
-Hey, you made it.
-Hi! Yeah.

32:31.920 --> 32:34.440
So, where were you all day,
like I can't guess?

32:34.520 --> 32:36.200
What do you mean,
what can't you guess?

32:36.280 --> 32:39.320
Angela, I know all about it.
I know about the letter.

32:39.400 --> 32:42.240
-You know about the letter?
-How could... you know...

32:44.080 --> 32:47.240
Brian Krakow,
the reason for all pain.

32:47.320 --> 32:49.040
(girl) These directions
don't make sense.

32:49.640 --> 32:52.320
(boy) Yeah, Mr. Katimsky, these
directions don't make sense.

32:52.400 --> 32:54.280
(Katimsky) I know, I'm coming.

32:56.280 --> 32:59.480
Um, you realize that Brian
wrote that letter, right?

33:02.120 --> 33:05.800
-Uh, well, yeah. I kinda figured that.
-Okay, good.

33:05.880 --> 33:07.560
I don't feel so bad
for blabbing it then.

33:07.640 --> 33:09.360
I kinda figured
you'd figure it out.

33:10.880 --> 33:11.960
Well, yeah.

33:12.760 --> 33:16.200
(Katimsky) Oh, enough tickets, gee whiz.
Anybody wanna go out for pizza?

33:16.280 --> 33:17.720
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

33:17.800 --> 33:20.600
-Um, could I have a ride home?
-Sure.

33:20.680 --> 33:22.840
Okay, everybody, c'mon.
Let's blow this pop stand.

33:25.560 --> 33:27.120
-(Rickie) I'll be right down.
-Oh, okay.

33:27.200 --> 33:31.720
(indistinct chatter)

33:33.640 --> 33:35.400
-I couldn't get my zipper zipped.
-(door closes)

33:36.640 --> 33:38.400
Uh, well, let me try.

33:44.360 --> 33:45.880
Uh, Delia?

33:47.520 --> 33:50.480
Maybe we should, uh...
go somewhere sometime?

33:50.960 --> 33:51.960
Okay.

33:53.000 --> 33:56.800
You know, like, uh...
to a movie or something.

33:57.880 --> 33:58.880
I'd like that.

34:01.680 --> 34:04.680
'Cause, um, I... I really think
we'd be good together.

34:06.920 --> 34:10.720
Okay, but, um, you're gay,
right?

34:13.600 --> 34:15.320
-Well, I, you know, I... I...
-Oh, I'm sorry.

34:15.400 --> 34:17.360
-I didn't...
-No, it... it... it's okay.

34:17.440 --> 34:21.240
-That came out so rude.
-No, uh, see I... I try not to, um...

34:21.320 --> 34:23.840
No, I... I don't like, uh...

34:27.920 --> 34:29.040
Yeah.

34:30.760 --> 34:31.880
I'm gay.

34:33.880 --> 34:36.840
I just don't usually
say it like that.

34:36.920 --> 34:40.320
-How do you usually say it?
-I don't usually say it.

34:42.440 --> 34:45.480
I mean, I've...
actually never said it...

34:46.440 --> 34:47.560
out loud.

34:48.960 --> 34:50.000
Wow.

34:52.040 --> 34:53.520
I feel kind of honored.

34:57.520 --> 34:58.920
I have to be honest.

35:00.480 --> 35:03.080
I have... the biggest crush
on you.

35:03.800 --> 35:05.640
(Delia chuckles)

35:06.040 --> 35:07.320
Another first.

35:08.160 --> 35:09.960
See, I've pretty much figured
it out.

35:10.040 --> 35:12.840
It's partly because, I think,
you're the most fantastic person.

35:14.600 --> 35:16.520
Plus, you're an awesome dancer.

35:17.520 --> 35:20.520
And partly that Brian Krakow
really hurt me.

35:21.120 --> 35:23.000
I'm sorry, I know he's, like,
a friend of yours and all,

35:23.080 --> 35:26.000
but he is the most self-centered,
low-down dog of all time.

35:26.080 --> 35:28.080
He uses girls, then,
like, tosses them aside.

35:30.960 --> 35:34.080
I guess I'm just...
sort of in the mood

35:34.160 --> 35:38.040
to have a crush on somebody
where... it can't hurt too much.

35:42.400 --> 35:43.600
Be my guest.

35:43.680 --> 35:47.200
(serene music playing)

35:47.280 --> 35:48.440
Uh, Delia...

35:50.360 --> 35:53.800
if I were attracted to girls,
I'd be attracted to you.

35:54.760 --> 35:56.440
(serene music continues)

36:03.320 --> 36:05.040
(Patty sighs)

36:10.400 --> 36:11.640
(knock on door)

36:26.440 --> 36:27.440
Hi.

36:27.520 --> 36:30.720
(upbeat music playing)

36:54.520 --> 36:58.440
(Patty) Okay. Well, what can I
say, huh? The best laid plans.

36:59.400 --> 37:01.840
You, too... Bye.

37:08.720 --> 37:10.120
More?

37:11.440 --> 37:14.200
Well, I have to say,
from everything that you've told me...

37:14.960 --> 37:18.320
I think it's clear that you
never really meant to hurt her.

37:24.920 --> 37:28.560
It's like... you think
you're safe, or something.

37:30.080 --> 37:34.280
'Cause you can just...
walk away anytime.

37:35.400 --> 37:36.400
Anytime.

37:38.120 --> 37:40.280
Because you know, like...
need her.

37:42.240 --> 37:43.720
You don't need anyone.

37:45.440 --> 37:47.280
But the thing
you didn't realize is...

37:49.400 --> 37:50.400
you're wrong.

37:54.760 --> 37:56.240
You always wear
this much makeup?

38:00.720 --> 38:05.480
Well, it was... I was expecting
company tonight. An old friend.

38:05.560 --> 38:07.800
That was he,
just now on the phone.

38:08.480 --> 38:10.960
Seems that, uh,
he has a touch of the flu, or something,

38:11.040 --> 38:13.480
and he took all this
decongestant,

38:13.560 --> 38:15.760
-and he was afraid to drive.
-(fridge door closes)

38:15.840 --> 38:21.920
(chuckles) This was a person who drove
so recklessly when he was seventeen,

38:22.000 --> 38:24.280
that my parents wanted him dead.

38:25.160 --> 38:27.440
Wow, ironic.

38:31.520 --> 38:33.040
(Graham) You're right,
the lamb was too rich.

38:33.120 --> 38:35.440
Hey, you're pro-butter.
They need to know that up front.

38:35.520 --> 38:38.200
-The sauce was overwhelming.
-No, the sauce was incredible.

38:38.280 --> 38:41.000
-It was a poem. Listen...
-(man clears throat)

38:41.440 --> 38:44.200
-(chair scrapes)
-I'm sorry, I have to say something.

38:46.720 --> 38:48.440
Our compliments to the chef.

38:48.520 --> 38:49.560
Hear, hear.

38:50.160 --> 38:51.920
-(woman) congratulations.
-(man) I'm very impressed.

38:52.000 --> 38:53.480
(woman) The sauce was...

38:53.560 --> 38:54.960
(applauding)

38:55.040 --> 38:58.880
(car engine stops)

38:58.960 --> 39:00.840
(Katimsky)
Okay, Angela, here we are.

39:03.520 --> 39:05.840
-Bye. Call me.
-Okay.

39:05.920 --> 39:09.160
-(dog barking indistinctly)
-(car leaving)

39:17.960 --> 39:20.840
(telephone rings)

39:20.920 --> 39:22.760
(Jordan) If that's a guy
named Tino, I'm not here.

39:25.200 --> 39:26.200
Hello?

39:26.800 --> 39:29.320
We're in the restaurant
business. Me included.

39:29.400 --> 39:32.760
(chuckles)
Sweetheart, that's great.

39:32.840 --> 39:35.040
(Graham) Well, what can I say?
I'm the best.

39:36.600 --> 39:42.240
-So, um... is he still there?
-Oh, no.

39:43.240 --> 39:45.560
(Graham) <i>So, what was it like,</i>
<i>seeing him again?</i>

39:46.120 --> 39:48.200
Like old times.

39:51.640 --> 39:54.800
I have to admit...
I'm somewhat jealous.

39:55.840 --> 39:56.840
Really?

39:58.720 --> 40:01.400
Well, I'm really glad.

40:02.440 --> 40:03.480
Me, too.

40:05.240 --> 40:07.400
Okay. Uh, I'll be home soon.

40:07.480 --> 40:08.680
-Okay.
-(Graham)<i> Bye.</i>

40:08.760 --> 40:09.760
Bye.

40:10.400 --> 40:12.240
-(slams telephone)
-(Patty sighs)

40:13.320 --> 40:14.640
Got any more milk?

40:19.000 --> 40:21.400
I just... I can't believe it.

40:23.160 --> 40:24.440
You always believed it.

40:25.120 --> 40:26.720
I mean, you acted like...

40:28.320 --> 40:31.120
It's just an act.
Don't you know that?

40:31.680 --> 40:33.600
(sighs) I don't know anything.

40:35.320 --> 40:39.440
-Wow. We... we did it.
-Yeah, we did it.

40:41.440 --> 40:44.320
-We did it!
-(laughs)

40:58.040 --> 41:01.360
-I'm wrecked. I gotta get home.
-Yeah, me, too.

41:02.320 --> 41:04.520
Let's... let's clean up
in the morning.

41:09.600 --> 41:10.760
(Hallie sighs)

41:15.440 --> 41:20.240
-Okay, uh, so, I'll see ya.
-Right. Bye.

41:25.520 --> 41:26.520
Uh, Brian?

41:30.240 --> 41:31.640
Brian, look at me.

41:40.920 --> 41:42.600
That letter I told you about.

41:45.000 --> 41:46.680
Rickie said you wrote it.

41:47.320 --> 41:50.440
-And I have to know because...
-Know what? There's nothing to know.

41:53.800 --> 41:55.400
Okay, what Rickie
probably meant is that,

41:55.480 --> 41:57.440
see...
Jordan Catalano asked me to,

41:57.520 --> 41:59.080
like, proofread it
for grammatical errors.

41:59.160 --> 42:01.000
You proofread a love letter?

42:02.240 --> 42:04.640
-Is this like a game to you?
-Um, hardly.

42:04.720 --> 42:06.440
But you admit
that you were involved.

42:06.520 --> 42:09.520
-I'm not admitting anything.
-This is a joke, right?

42:10.640 --> 42:12.880
That the... the two of...

42:15.800 --> 42:17.120
oh, God.

42:18.560 --> 42:20.120
I can't believe I fell for it.

42:20.880 --> 42:24.120
-It's obviously a total lie.
-No, I meant every word.

42:27.400 --> 42:30.880
I mean, the person who wrote it
meant every word. Probably.

42:33.160 --> 42:35.240
-Brian?
-I didn't write it.

42:35.720 --> 42:37.960
-But, Brian, you said...
-Forget what I said.

42:38.040 --> 42:39.600
Forget this whole conversation!

42:42.440 --> 42:43.560
How?

42:44.200 --> 42:46.160
(somber music playing)

42:52.360 --> 42:54.160
You liked it, though, right?

42:55.960 --> 42:59.200
It made you, like... happy?

43:02.360 --> 43:03.360
Yeah.

43:07.840 --> 43:11.560
'Cause that's probably
all that... you know, matters.

43:13.320 --> 43:14.320
To who?

43:16.440 --> 43:17.600
To, you know...

43:20.000 --> 43:22.760
the person... who wrote it.
