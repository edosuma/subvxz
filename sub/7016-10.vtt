WEBVTT

00:04.765 --> 00:07.170
Hyde. New releases just
arrived at the store.

00:07.383 --> 00:09.205
Oh ! Is that Abba ?

00:10.301 --> 00:10.842
Huh

00:13.647 --> 00:16.747
Oh cool ! I love
the Talking Heads.

00:16.768 --> 00:21.018
They have a girl in the band and she’s like a real
musician who doesn’t have to use her sex-appeal.

00:22.110 --> 00:24.285
Although it wouldn’t kill
her to put on some lipstick.

00:25.118 --> 00:28.347
Maybe pop a few zits…I mean
you’re on stage for God’s sake.

00:29.510 --> 00:33.079
My band has a girl in it too. We
totally respect her as a musician.

00:33.126 --> 00:35.732
A musician with
really big boobs.

00:38.168 --> 00:40.721
Hey. You know what they
should have ? An all girl band.

00:40.752 --> 00:44.258
Except in stead of playing instruments,
they just dance around and make out.

00:45.988 --> 00:48.164
You know you and Karan
could totally hit it off.

00:48.208 --> 00:51.338
My band and I are heading up to my parents
cabin this weekend. If you wanna come ?

00:51.498 --> 00:52.363
Oh well

00:52.705 --> 00:55.920
me to shave a G into his
back for the Packers’ game.

00:57.235 --> 00:58.013
Soooo….

00:58.827 --> 01:00.710
YES, I would love to come.

01:01.517 --> 01:03.773
Ohhh Barry Manilow.

01:03.817 --> 01:05.700
Alright Randy, here is
what I want you to do.

01:05.855 --> 01:07.661
Take this record,
go back to the store.

01:07.686 --> 01:10.321
Anybody looks like a Manilow-fan,
chuck it at their head.

01:11.557 --> 01:13.732
Even better. I’ll throw
it at their crotch.

01:14.797 --> 01:16.770
We don’t want those
people reproducing.

01:19.455 --> 01:20.921
Sooo…Donna.

01:21.417 --> 01:24.110
Sounds good. You
and Randy in a cabin.

01:24.356 --> 01:26.531
Breathing in the
fresh mountain air.

01:26.586 --> 01:27.841
Having sex.

01:28.758 --> 01:30.570
What are you talking about ?

01:30.786 --> 01:34.261
Well you see, when a boy likes a
girl, the boy gets the girl drunk…

01:34.286 --> 01:34.962
Hyde.

01:36.827 --> 01:38.381
That’s not gonna happen.

01:38.516 --> 01:41.272
He’s not into me like that and he
knows I’m getting over a break-up.

01:41.295 --> 01:42.891
Come on man. Don’t you
know how guys think ?

01:42.916 --> 01:43.902
Not really.

01:44.007 --> 01:46.602
The only guy I have ever been
with is Eric, and as far as I know,

01:46.648 --> 01:51.352
a typical guys thoughts are: Who would
win in a fight ? Bigfoot or Chewbacca ?

01:54.337 --> 01:54.930
All right.

01:55.948 --> 01:57.950
Here is what a typical
guy thinks about.

01:58.175 --> 02:00.432
Sex, beer and pinball.

02:01.057 --> 02:01.781
Now,

02:02.205 --> 02:05.001
if a guy can have sex while
drinking beer on a pinball machine…

02:06.365 --> 02:08.631
well that’s the beautiful
story of how I met my wife.

02:12.266 --> 02:15.573
Well…if it isn’t Miss Mooch,
my unemployed roommate.

02:16.567 --> 02:19.073
What would you like to mooch
today ? My cheese puffs ?

02:20.548 --> 02:21.751
My yoo-hoo ?

02:22.966 --> 02:24.601
My Oil of Olaz ?

02:25.668 --> 02:28.481
Fez, I want to find work
but it’s really hard.

02:28.528 --> 02:30.880
I spend all morning going
to every store in the mall.

02:30.915 --> 02:33.713
And when I find the right
outfit, I’m gonna look for a job.

02:35.885 --> 02:39.780
Fez ! I look fantastic !

02:43.388 --> 02:47.210
You know, I always give
credit where credit is due. So,

02:47.567 --> 02:51.150
thank you God for my
fantastic bone-structure !

02:52.705 --> 02:55.783
So Christine, what’s on the agenda
for my favorite local talk show host ?

02:55.805 --> 02:58.061
I mean besides from
looking Fez-tastic.

02:59.075 --> 03:01.333
Well today I’m
off to the zoo.

03:01.357 --> 03:04.302
It seems a baby
elephant is being born.

03:04.357 --> 03:06.753
And I wanna be the
first thing it sees,

03:06.785 --> 03:10.693
so it knows there is
beauty in this ugly world.

03:12.846 --> 03:15.171
Well for my money, nothing
beats the time when you

03:15.207 --> 03:18.033
ran along with cops and stopped
the liquor store hold-up.

03:18.058 --> 03:24.043
Well, I got lucky then. The day before
the show I learned to do the Flamenco.

03:24.085 --> 03:27.691
And as it turns out,
a high dance kick

03:27.747 --> 03:31.541
doubles beautifully for a
knock-out blow to the face.

03:33.535 --> 03:34.560
Ciao darling !

03:34.878 --> 03:38.540
I love it when she says ciao. It's like
she made up a whole new way to say goodbye.

03:41.067 --> 03:44.123
Was that Christine St.
George ?! She my idol !

03:44.146 --> 03:45.841
THAT's who I should
be working for !

03:45.875 --> 03:48.392
OH ! We could co-anchor
What's Up Wisconsin together !

03:48.427 --> 03:50.542
Oh, I could
just picture it !

03:58.446 --> 04:03.022
- I'm Christine St. George.
- And I'm Jackie St. Jackie !

04:04.198 --> 04:05.991
And it's time to ask...

04:06.025 --> 04:08.413
- What's up Wisconsin ?
- What's up Wisconsin ?

04:12.545 --> 04:17.231
Coming up today: war,
famine, disease...

04:17.377 --> 04:19.870
But first, our top story.

04:20.158 --> 04:24.230
Jackie St. Jackie
is SPECTACULAR !

04:25.748 --> 04:29.432
And in sports
today: I'm GORGEOUS !

04:30.246 --> 04:31.991
Oh, this is just in.

04:32.027 --> 04:36.412
Jackie St. Jackie is
the greatest girl ever !

04:36.736 --> 04:39.082
- I am !
- I know !

04:40.857 --> 04:43.761
Jackie St. Jackie ?
I got breaking news.

04:44.535 --> 04:46.021
You're freaking nuts !

04:50.227 --> 04:53.762
That 70's SHow

Oh Jackie, you're watching Christine
St. George. I just love her !

05:35.815 --> 05:38.260
The other day she had
a tiger cub on her show

05:38.305 --> 05:40.420
it was just the sweetest
thing you ever saw !

05:40.468 --> 05:42.883
Right up until it
mauled the weather man.

05:44.748 --> 05:46.712
Yah, but he
probably deserved it.

05:46.758 --> 05:48.483
He looks like he
smells like ham.

05:49.478 --> 05:52.402
Oh but you what Christine
handled it perfectly.

05:52.436 --> 05:55.540
She distracted the tiger with
the food critic’s lamb chop

05:55.575 --> 05:58.961
and then she made a tourniquet
out of her microphone cord.

06:00.366 --> 06:01.982
I know, she's amazing !

06:02.018 --> 06:03.421
Oh, oh she's back !

06:03.446 --> 06:07.372
That sure is one
big pumpkin Tim !

06:08.658 --> 06:12.972
Coming up, a high school
marching band that collectively

06:13.005 --> 06:16.341
has lost more
then 400 pounds !

06:17.228 --> 06:18.131
You know what ?

06:18.315 --> 06:20.812
I'm gonna write Christine a
letter and ask her for a job.

06:20.848 --> 06:24.253
Oh no no no no, you have got
to go talk to her in person.

06:24.367 --> 06:29.133
Trust me, there is nothing celebrities like
more then people showing up in their offices.

06:35.496 --> 06:36.130
Steven,

06:37.908 --> 06:42.962
you have finally reached that point in your
life where you're no longer a dumb-ass-kid.

06:44.726 --> 06:46.460
You're a
dumb-ass-man.

06:48.326 --> 06:51.660
Wow. Those dumb-ass-teen
years just flew by.

06:52.937 --> 06:54.502
And now that you're married,

06:55.036 --> 06:58.930
I'm gonna take you through a rite
of passage. To the Viking Lodge

06:59.758 --> 07:01.592
Gosh Red. I don't
know what to say.

07:01.947 --> 07:04.613
I guess the first thing
that comes to mind is uh...

07:05.036 --> 07:05.712
no.

07:07.966 --> 07:11.583
I stripped at the Viking Lodge
in Vegas for a guys 85th birthday.

07:11.626 --> 07:13.031
He had a heart attack.

07:14.336 --> 07:17.773
But then the paramedics showed up
and they were really good tippers.

07:18.957 --> 07:20.653
Come on Steven !

07:20.845 --> 07:24.883
You need a place where you can hang out
and have a beer with other married men.

07:24.985 --> 07:27.141
BOY does that sound boring.

07:28.277 --> 07:31.642
Hanging out in a dingy room
drinking beer and doing nothing.

07:33.425 --> 07:35.851
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'll be in the basement...

07:37.747 --> 07:39.673
All right Red.
I guess I'll go.

07:39.727 --> 07:42.510
You're not gonna make me wear one
of those silly Viking heads are you ?

07:42.628 --> 07:44.500
Course not, don't
be ridiculous.

07:44.776 --> 07:46.881
Ours have horns
and chin straps.

07:46.925 --> 07:49.570
And your name stitched
in yarn. It's very classy.

07:59.785 --> 08:02.410
Wow. Nice cabin.

08:03.026 --> 08:07.452
It has a cozy, mid-century
dead carcass feel to it.

08:07.888 --> 08:11.301
Yeah. I like to come up here when
I really feel like roughing it.

08:11.598 --> 08:15.103
So, you hook up the VCR,
I’ll go microwave some nachos

08:17.455 --> 08:18.443
Heyyy Donna.

08:19.447 --> 08:21.592
Did you have sex
with Randy yet ?

08:21.848 --> 08:23.112
Would you shut up ?!

08:23.305 --> 08:25.172
That is NOT what
this weekend is about.

08:25.216 --> 08:25.901
Oh.

08:26.328 --> 08:27.740
Yeah. You’re right.

08:28.346 --> 08:31.381
A guy invites a hot girl to a
private cabin deep in the woods.

08:31.428 --> 08:32.861
It can only mean one thing.

08:33.395 --> 08:34.543
He wants you to
meet his band !

08:34.565 --> 08:35.190
Okay.

08:35.587 --> 08:37.783
Maybe it’s a little weird
that they’re not here.

08:38.028 --> 08:38.940
A little weird ?

08:39.335 --> 08:42.840
That’s like saying it’s a little crazy
that you’re talking to a floating head.

08:44.275 --> 08:45.920
We are all alone.

08:46.552 --> 08:47.838
Did bring wine.

08:49.158 --> 08:52.514
Wait a minute ! Maybe you’re right
! Maybe he wants to get it on !

08:53.458 --> 08:55.768
Did somebody
say “get it on” ?

08:57.366 --> 08:59.052
Fez will you
get out of here ?

08:59.075 --> 09:00.541
Yeah Fez, beat it !

09:01.107 --> 09:02.440
Why you…

09:05.135 --> 09:06.443
Son of a bitch !

09:12.178 --> 09:15.113
Hiiii, uh, I’m here to
see Christine St. George.

09:15.155 --> 09:16.570
Do you have an appointment ?

09:16.606 --> 09:20.280
No, but I am her biggest fan and
I would love to be her co-anchor.

09:20.316 --> 09:23.322
Okay, have a seat and a
psychiatrist will be right with you.

09:25.207 --> 09:28.611
Oh please Miss, couldn’t you
just let us in for two minutes ?

09:28.658 --> 09:29.973
I got a better idea.

09:30.008 --> 09:32.222
How about if I let
you in for no minutes ?

09:32.725 --> 09:36.063
Please ? Please could you let us in ?
I know I have what it takes to be on TV

09:36.088 --> 09:38.702
and I just need to demonstrate
my talents to Christine.

09:38.805 --> 09:40.550
Oh and I just
want an autograph.

09:41.518 --> 09:42.833
Or a souvenir.

09:43.918 --> 09:47.100
She made cheesecake on
yesterday’s show, is that around ?

09:48.278 --> 09:49.850
You really want
to get in huh ?

09:49.898 --> 09:52.260
Okay, I’m thinking of a
number between one and ten.

09:52.308 --> 09:53.733
- Six.
- You got it !

09:53.918 --> 09:55.703
Ohhh So does that mean
that we can go in ?!

09:55.747 --> 09:58.792
No. That’s the number of cops I’m
gonna call if you don’t beat it.

09:59.566 --> 10:02.191
But... I’m supposed
to be her co-anchor !

10:02.226 --> 10:04.531
And I’m supposed to
be Brooke Shields.

10:05.565 --> 10:07.073
Ain’t life a bitch ?

10:17.336 --> 10:19.853
So Steven, this is the Viking
Lodge. What do you think ?

10:20.675 --> 10:23.271
I can see why you got that
CPR poster in the hallway.

10:25.078 --> 10:25.801
Red !

10:27.026 --> 10:30.392
It’s great to see you
! Who’s the new guy ?

10:30.706 --> 10:33.333
Murph, Smitty, this
is my friend Steven.

10:33.368 --> 10:34.012
Hey

10:34.068 --> 10:36.361
Steven just got married.

10:36.726 --> 10:38.101
My condolences.

10:39.408 --> 10:43.572
Listen. I’ve been married for forty
years and I’m half the man I used to be.

10:43.586 --> 10:44.900
But it even out.

10:44.955 --> 10:47.470
My wife is twice the
woman she used to be.

10:48.515 --> 10:50.300
He’s saying she’s fat.

10:52.007 --> 10:53.240
Biiiiig woman.

10:55.016 --> 10:59.570
You know, pretty soon your wife will be
nagging at you about doing one chore or another.

10:59.587 --> 11:03.520
You know uh taking out the
garbage, mowing the lawn.

11:04.107 --> 11:05.730
Making love to her.

11:07.226 --> 11:10.511
Wait till she starts finishing
your sentences for you.

11:10.536 --> 11:12.662
Or in my case, my pieces.

11:15.688 --> 11:19.281
You know I used to think it was cute
when my wife finished my sentences.

11:19.635 --> 11:21.681
You know what I want
her to finish now ?

11:22.015 --> 11:22.920
Living !

11:27.117 --> 11:27.853
See,

11:28.496 --> 11:30.342
that’s the thing
about marriage.

11:30.705 --> 11:32.942
No-one tells you
about the three rings.

11:33.485 --> 11:35.811
There’s the engagement
ring, the wedding ring,

11:35.855 --> 11:37.171
and the suffer-ring.

11:40.638 --> 11:42.713
He’s saying she’s annoying.

11:43.468 --> 11:45.032
Biiiiig pain.

11:46.258 --> 11:49.203
Is this all you guys do ? Kinda stand around
the bar and complain about your wives ?

11:49.227 --> 11:50.393
Of course not !

11:53.047 --> 11:55.962
So listen. I’m having a
few drinks the other night.

11:56.015 --> 12:00.202
And my old lady says: I suppose you
like yourself better when you’re drunk ?

12:00.246 --> 12:02.652
I says: No, I
like you better.

12:04.235 --> 12:07.581
My wife came to me the other day
and said: We don’t talk anymore !

12:07.618 --> 12:09.730
And I said: You
ruined the streak !

12:13.827 --> 12:16.050
You know, I’m learning a
lot from you guys in here.

12:16.787 --> 12:18.863
For instance: bras.

12:20.036 --> 12:21.540
Not just for girls.

12:24.795 --> 12:27.151
the steam is great.

12:28.287 --> 12:32.221
Time to loosen the towel
and release the hounds

12:33.806 --> 12:35.482
Don’t look
down….don’t look down…

12:36.698 --> 12:38.833
Aaaaahhhhh ! I
saw the hounds !

12:44.587 --> 12:45.980
Ms. St. George,

12:46.055 --> 12:49.390
you put the beauty
in beautiful, the sass

12:49.446 --> 12:52.420
in sassy and what else can
I say ? I love a big tip !

12:54.045 --> 12:57.733
And what else can I say ?
I love a big kiss-ass !

13:01.575 --> 13:03.311
So, who is gonna be
on the show today ?

13:03.348 --> 13:05.072
Oh, Pete Rose.

13:05.107 --> 13:09.760
I gotta go warm-up, I don’t want
my slider to hang over the plate.

13:09.806 --> 13:12.481
He really took me
downtown last time,

13:12.515 --> 13:15.400
but not today Pete Rose !

13:16.306 --> 13:18.052
NOT today.

13:18.996 --> 13:21.480
Okay well, let me get your hair
products, I’ll be right back.

13:21.516 --> 13:22.573
Okay darling.

13:24.817 --> 13:29.230
Hiiiii, this is Jackie St. Jackie,
reporting live from Fresh Hair.

13:29.497 --> 13:33.091
Today’s topic: Ugly people
who are running with scissors,

13:33.595 --> 13:36.601
health hazard or
community service ?

13:39.448 --> 13:43.333
Ohhhh why hello
Christine St. George !

13:43.366 --> 13:46.993
Why hello crazy girl
talking into a hairbrush !

13:48.585 --> 13:49.300
Jackie !

13:49.785 --> 13:51.262
Out ! Out ! Out ! Out !

13:53.735 --> 13:55.712
I apologize Miss St. George.

13:56.066 --> 13:57.412
This is Jackie, my roommate.

13:57.446 --> 14:00.060
She wants to be your co-anchor
on What’s Up Wisconsin.

14:00.097 --> 14:03.173
Huh. Well, from what I’ve
seen you do so far Jackie….

14:03.216 --> 14:06.780
I’d say yououou
have what it takes.

14:07.336 --> 14:08.022
Really ?!

14:08.065 --> 14:12.423
Uhhhh no. But you seem like a
dear thing so good luck to you.

14:13.425 --> 14:14.410
Adios !

14:16.596 --> 14:18.872
Adios ? How does she
even come up with those ?

14:20.985 --> 14:22.712
OH, she forgot her hair
products. Christine !

14:22.736 --> 14:26.650
Wait ! No no ! Fez ! Wait, wait,
let me deliver them to the studio.

14:26.686 --> 14:29.120
They’ll have to let me
in and I can talk to her.

14:29.347 --> 14:31.052
I don’t know Jackie.

14:31.278 --> 14:33.330
I’ll give you a free
peek at me in the shower.

14:34.357 --> 14:36.011
This end is up

14:42.556 --> 14:46.872
Well, it took a while, but then the rugged
outdoors man finally got the fire going.

14:48.876 --> 14:50.871
Lucky for us he
was hiking by.

14:54.305 --> 14:57.083
Well Randy. Here
we are. All alone.

14:57.787 --> 15:00.393
In front of a
nice roaring fire.

15:01.507 --> 15:03.971
This has worked
out perfectly.

15:04.177 --> 15:07.973
The only thing you forgot
is I’m not a stupid bimbo !

15:09.256 --> 15:09.762
What ?

15:09.786 --> 15:13.961
This whole act may work on your
little groupies, but not me.

15:13.995 --> 15:17.433
So find another groupie to
grope, you gross groupie groper !

15:20.007 --> 15:21.611
Donna, how can
you say that ?

15:22.566 --> 15:25.713
I mean literally, that
sounded really hard to say !

15:26.885 --> 15:29.901
This whole night has been one
long set up to get me alone !

15:29.926 --> 15:32.471
Oops, my friends didn’t
make it, what’s next,

15:32.495 --> 15:36.350
oops, I spilled wine on your
blouse, oops, we’re naked !

15:36.448 --> 15:39.393
Oops, made an ice cream
sundae on your boobs !

15:41.755 --> 15:44.113
Uh Donna…meet my band.

15:45.937 --> 15:48.231
The band is here !

15:51.278 --> 15:52.910
Band, meet Donna.

15:53.038 --> 15:55.260
Believe it or
not, she’s sober.

15:57.106 --> 15:58.890
I’ll help you guys
unload the van.

15:59.998 --> 16:01.313
Uhm Randy…

16:03.316 --> 16:06.452
I feel like such a moron, I thought
you were trying to hit on me.

16:06.745 --> 16:08.401
Donna, I wouldn’t do that.

16:08.976 --> 16:11.431
I’m pretty old-fashioned
when it comes to romance.

16:11.518 --> 16:14.881
We’re talking flowers,
candy, love poems.

16:15.308 --> 16:16.001
And well,

16:16.706 --> 16:18.672
you haven’t given me
any of those things.

16:23.736 --> 16:25.763
I mean this is gonna be
really hard to say but

16:25.918 --> 16:29.100
I’m sorry that I called you a groupie gro
- a gross groupie…

16:29.135 --> 16:30.713
I can’t even say it.

16:35.548 --> 16:37.382
Wait, you two aren’t
going to do it ?!

16:37.628 --> 16:39.533
No. You guys were wrong.

16:39.867 --> 16:43.251
And since I control you,
I can make you do this !

16:48.695 --> 16:50.213
Donna stop it !

16:51.307 --> 16:53.220
Gross man, what did
you eat for lunch ?!

16:57.198 --> 17:00.532
Christine St. George ?
Hi, uh Jackie Burkhart.

17:00.778 --> 17:04.083
Yes the roving
hairbrush reporter.

17:04.925 --> 17:06.910
How did you get
past reception ?

17:06.948 --> 17:10.880
Well I really wanted to talk to you, so I
asked Fez if I could deliver your hair products.

17:10.907 --> 17:14.133
Oh. Oh ! Well
I’m glad you did.

17:14.818 --> 17:19.272
Because now that I see you
standing in a television studio,

17:19.308 --> 17:22.752
I think you have a solid
career ahead of you.

17:23.017 --> 17:24.592
As a delivery girl.

17:25.688 --> 17:27.910
Can I validate
your parking ?

17:28.908 --> 17:31.373
But Ms. St. George please, if
you would just give me a chance ?

17:31.405 --> 17:34.042
Look, I know I have what
it takes to be on TV.

17:34.077 --> 17:36.272
I own three of them !

17:38.125 --> 17:40.181
I also know
everything about you.

17:40.215 --> 17:43.270
What you like, what you
don’t like. What you wear.

17:44.165 --> 17:47.733
Dear, these are skills
I could teach a monkey

17:48.695 --> 17:53.412
And as a matter of
fact, I did. Episode 427.

17:56.166 --> 17:56.831
Wow.

17:57.147 --> 17:58.663
But here’s the good news.

17:58.898 --> 17:59.960
I like you.

18:00.355 --> 18:02.963
You’ve got sssspirit.

18:03.177 --> 18:06.243
No…m…moxie, yes mo… Wait,

18:06.286 --> 18:08.300
no, it’s it’s gumption.

18:08.396 --> 18:11.501
Oh there’s a word for it
and I can’t think what it is…

18:12.007 --> 18:14.340
Oh well. But the
point is, look,

18:14.395 --> 18:19.563
you have a job if you
want it, as my assistant.

18:19.586 --> 18:20.751
- Really ?!
- Yes.

18:20.785 --> 18:21.863
Ohhh I’ll take it !

18:21.908 --> 18:24.940
Ohhh ! I have a job in
television ! Oh wait, wait,

18:24.978 --> 18:27.481
do I get to say
What’s Up Wisconsin ?

18:27.505 --> 18:29.960
You can answer the
phone any way you like !

18:37.168 --> 18:39.903
Oh there is my little
Viking-in-training.

18:41.168 --> 18:42.753
So, how was last night ?

18:42.788 --> 18:45.113
Don’t even get me
started on the hounds.

18:46.828 --> 18:48.431
Oh ! The hounds…

18:50.636 --> 18:52.962
The hounds are an
old man’s testicles.

18:55.917 --> 18:58.112
I don’t know how I’m gonna tell
Red, but I don’t wanna be a Viking.

18:58.138 --> 19:00.832
All that those guys do is sit around
and complain about their wives.

19:01.006 --> 19:04.421
Oh Steven no. Those men
were just kidding around.

19:04.468 --> 19:06.593
Did Red tell the one
about the three rings ?

19:06.638 --> 19:07.961
I came up with that.

19:12.097 --> 19:13.191
Steven !

19:14.408 --> 19:16.582
Bad news about
the Viking Lodge.

19:16.606 --> 19:17.861
They don’t want you back.

19:19.838 --> 19:21.832
All my hopes and
dreams have been...

19:22.408 --> 19:23.313
unaffected.

19:25.578 --> 19:28.932
But you know, just out of curiosity,
why would they not want me back ?

19:29.756 --> 19:30.783
It was Smitty.

19:31.766 --> 19:34.390
He felt that your
eyes were…lingering…

19:43.327 --> 19:44.570
Oh Jackie.

19:44.837 --> 19:46.601
How is the first
day of work going ?

19:46.655 --> 19:51.241
Terrific. I can’t believe I’m in
the glamorous world of show business.

19:51.306 --> 19:53.440
I have finally arrived !

19:53.485 --> 19:54.872
Oh, here is your coffee.

19:54.895 --> 19:55.731
Thank you

19:58.955 --> 20:03.590
Uhm, I asked for half
and half. This is milk.

20:04.565 --> 20:07.511
Right, but I kind of thought
they were the same thing.

20:08.796 --> 20:13.121
No no, half and half is
NOT the same thing as milk.

20:13.497 --> 20:14.371
They’re different.

20:15.148 --> 20:20.941
Just as listening to me and NOT
listening to me….are different.

20:21.818 --> 20:26.090
Like happy and
FURIOUS are different !

20:26.126 --> 20:29.233
Like employed and
FIRED are different,

20:29.286 --> 20:32.242
do we understand
each other ? GOOD !

20:33.248 --> 20:36.881
Now get me the coffee I want
or I’ll get a monkey to do it !

20:40.097 --> 20:42.263
Jackie ! Psst ! Come here !

20:45.596 --> 20:47.380
Don’t take it
so hard sweetie.

20:47.405 --> 20:50.243
Sometimes Christine flies
off the handle like that.

20:50.275 --> 20:52.630
But most of the time
she’s a real sweetheart.

20:52.656 --> 20:54.273
- Oh. Really ?
- No.

20:55.538 --> 20:57.561
Welcome to hell !
