00:03.504 --> 00:05.881
You're gonna like this.

00:06.924 --> 00:10.260
Dark Ages.

00:10.260 --> 00:14.264
The Dark Ages were called
the Dark Ages becau...

00:14.264 --> 00:15.975
Because it was a period
of intellectual darkness

00:15.975 --> 00:18.018
that followed the decline
of the Roman Empire.

00:18.018 --> 00:23.273
No...because there
were so many "nights."

00:26.610 --> 00:29.864
Knights! Come on, seriously?

00:31.657 --> 00:33.993
Knights!

00:36.328 --> 00:40.374
No, don't write this down.
Are you guys kidding me?

00:40.374 --> 00:43.251
-It's like a riddle?
-No, it's not a riddle,

00:43.251 --> 00:47.756
it's a joke. It's a joke,
it's a very clever joke.

00:47.756 --> 00:49.842
So which
answer's right?

00:49.842 --> 00:52.970
Seriously, Jonathan?
Both answers are right.

00:52.970 --> 00:57.349
Both, I will accept my answer,
or Sheila's answer on the test.

00:57.349 --> 01:00.978
Mine is a better answer,
a funnier answer.

01:00.978 --> 01:05.524
It's too funny.
It's over your heads, that's the
problem. It just went whoosh.

01:05.524 --> 01:08.193
Too clever, I'll dumb it down
a bit for you next time.

01:08.193 --> 01:10.195
♪ I'm awesome,
no, you're not ♪

01:10.195 --> 01:12.489
♪ Dude, don't lie,
I'm awesome ♪

01:12.489 --> 01:14.867

01:22.666 --> 01:26.461
( sighs )
Bobbi?

01:26.461 --> 01:28.005
-Yeah?
-Phys-ed department update.

01:28.005 --> 01:30.089
Mr. Webster will not be

01:30.089 --> 01:32.843
-returning to us.
-Mm-hmm. Why?

01:32.843 --> 01:35.637
You're gonna need a replacement
right away.

01:35.637 --> 01:37.472
Gerry, would
you like to have this

01:37.472 --> 01:39.641
-conversation with Bobbi?
-Yes. Bobbi?

01:39.641 --> 01:42.269
Gerry, you can't, you don't
know what I'm going to say.

01:42.269 --> 01:43.729
I have an idea.

01:43.729 --> 01:45.146
The point is, when two
people are talking,

01:45.146 --> 01:47.232
you don't interrupt,
so point taken.

01:47.232 --> 01:49.985
No, you can't say something
and then say point taken.

01:49.985 --> 01:52.404
I could say point taken on what
you said, but I didn't

01:52.404 --> 01:55.741
because I didn't agree with it.
Now, you could say point
taken to what I said.

01:55.741 --> 01:58.326
I could, yeah.

01:58.326 --> 02:01.121
Stop talking, the point is,
we need to move fast on this
so I need resumes on my desk

02:01.121 --> 02:03.832
as soon as possible.
Like ASAP!

02:03.832 --> 02:07.335
Point taken, which means
I agree, I get it.

02:07.335 --> 02:10.297
I'm gonna do that,
understand?

02:13.550 --> 02:16.511
You guys are aware Mr. Webster's
no longer at the school?

02:16.511 --> 02:19.389
-What happened to Mr. Webster?
-It doesn't matter
what happened.

02:19.389 --> 02:22.309
Heard he started dating
a girl in grade 12.

02:22.309 --> 02:25.896
Jimmy, you can't spread
rumors like that.

02:25.896 --> 02:27.648
I'm stating facts, sir.

02:27.648 --> 02:31.652
Who? Who...who was the girl?

02:31.652 --> 02:33.528
I heard it was
Jenna Bledsoe.

02:33.528 --> 02:37.491
-She's such a slut.
-Maya! You can't say that

02:37.491 --> 02:41.829
a student's a slut!
That is ridiculous.

02:41.829 --> 02:43.705
Why would you say she's a slut?

02:43.705 --> 02:47.793
-Just the stuff I heard
she does with guys.
-Would you stop!?

02:47.793 --> 02:51.839
Like what? Like what kind
of stuff? What kind of stuff?

02:51.839 --> 02:54.549
No, you know what?
This is silly.

02:54.549 --> 02:57.719
Point is, I'm gonna be

02:57.719 --> 03:00.514
moving into the phys-ed
department, I think.

03:00.514 --> 03:03.892
I saw a phys-ed looking guy
in the main office this morning.
I bet he gets the job.

03:03.892 --> 03:06.394
Why would you say he gets it?

03:06.394 --> 03:08.814
Just 'cause he looks
like a phys-ed teacher.

03:08.814 --> 03:11.066
There's no such thing,

03:11.066 --> 03:15.154
that, I, I'm a phys-ed looking
guy then, maybe I'll get it.

03:15.154 --> 03:17.572
-He's younger.
-Younger?

03:17.572 --> 03:20.993
-Younger.
-How old do you
guys think I am?

03:20.993 --> 03:23.078
-46.
-How old?

03:23.078 --> 03:25.372
-46.
-46.

03:25.372 --> 03:27.457
-You think I'm 46?
-Every day I walk in here,

03:27.457 --> 03:29.250
I look at your face
and I say 46.

03:29.250 --> 03:32.963
-I see 32 when I look at you.
How does that make you feel?
-Awesome.

03:32.963 --> 03:37.801
Awesome?! 46...how many
people think I'm 46?

03:37.801 --> 03:39.636
Oh, you...

03:39.636 --> 03:41.680
Oh, my God.

03:44.933 --> 03:48.228
Ah, just like I told
you, Ms. Mason can
often be found

03:48.228 --> 03:53.316
hard at work at her desk.
Or at least pretending
to be hard at work.

03:53.316 --> 03:57.529
-Mr. Cheeley, you're hilarious.
-Guilty.

03:57.529 --> 03:59.990
Ms. Mason,
this is Rebecca Lewis,
your new student teacher.

03:59.990 --> 04:02.659
Hi, it's really nice
to finally meet you.

04:02.659 --> 04:06.830
I'll be evaluating Rebecca
based on her teaching here
at Xavier.

04:06.830 --> 04:10.084
In fact,
Rebecca's teaching future is
in my hands, literally,

04:10.084 --> 04:14.922
but from what I've seen so far
things are looking pretty good.

04:14.922 --> 04:18.717
Well, we'll have to see.

04:18.717 --> 04:22.429
Good thing I'm the one
doing your evaluation, huh?

04:22.429 --> 04:25.849
Mr. Cheeley! Behave!

04:25.849 --> 04:28.518
Please, call me
Robert Cheeley.

04:37.360 --> 04:39.821
-Hey, Gerry.
-Karl.

04:39.821 --> 04:42.365
-Phys-ed interview?
-Uh, yes.

04:46.954 --> 04:50.290
Oh, no worries. Been
like that most of my life.

04:50.290 --> 04:51.959
Oh, sorry.

04:55.587 --> 04:57.839
-Lawnmower?
-No.

04:57.839 --> 05:01.635
No...so how do you teach
soccer throw ins? 'Cause that--

05:01.635 --> 05:05.680
'cause a one, a one-arm
throw-in is illegal.

05:05.680 --> 05:08.642
It's against the rules...
archery? Stuff like...

05:08.642 --> 05:10.936
Hey, you must be Karl.

05:10.936 --> 05:12.771
Thanks for coming in
on such short notice.

05:12.771 --> 05:16.817
Um, your, uh, ah,

05:16.817 --> 05:20.195
your resume...
( clears throat )

05:20.195 --> 05:23.991
Ah, your resume looks great
and I'm just, I'm just
going to go

05:23.991 --> 05:26.034
to a quick meeting
with the vice principal
and I'll be right back.

05:26.034 --> 05:29.370
-Okay.
-Thank you.

05:30.747 --> 05:32.582
-Well, good luck, Karl.
-Thanks.

05:32.582 --> 05:35.043
All right, hope
the interview goes well.

05:37.504 --> 05:39.006
-Was it a windmill?
-No.

05:39.006 --> 05:41.591
Not a windmill.

05:41.591 --> 05:46.013
So Ms. Lewis and Mr. Cheeley
will be spending a few days
in our class this week.

05:46.013 --> 05:47.931
I'll take it
from here, Ms. Mason.

05:47.931 --> 05:50.809
Now, I know for
a fact that when
Ms. Lewis starts

05:50.809 --> 05:53.187
teaching later this week, you
will extend to her, the same

05:53.187 --> 05:55.689
level of courtesy and respect
you give to Ms. Mason.

05:55.689 --> 05:57.858
-Maybe more.
-I wouldn't say more.

05:57.858 --> 05:59.567
Please, Ms. Mason, don't
interrupt me when I'm speaking

05:59.567 --> 06:03.488
to the students. Carry on.

06:03.488 --> 06:06.867
If you wanted to say
something to the class on
your first day, go for it.

06:06.867 --> 06:11.330
Sure, okay. Hey, guys.
I'm super excited to be here.

06:11.330 --> 06:15.374
You might find that my approach
to teaching is a little bit
different than Ms. Mason's,

06:15.374 --> 06:18.128
but I don't mean this in a bad
way or anything,

06:18.128 --> 06:20.588
but mine might
be a little more fun.

06:20.588 --> 06:24.092
-So dress casual tomorrow.
-Ms. Lewis?

06:24.092 --> 06:26.011
-Yeah.
-We wear uniforms.

06:26.011 --> 06:30.098
Right, well,
in your minds then.

06:30.098 --> 06:32.767
Oh, we can't use
phones in the school.

06:32.767 --> 06:35.354
Oh, it's cool,
I've got four bars.

06:38.439 --> 06:41.442
Okay, let's start
from our last class.

06:41.442 --> 06:45.947
Now who can tell
me what the largest
mountain range in Europe is?

06:45.947 --> 06:50.202
Oh, I loved Europe.
Can't wait to go back.

06:50.202 --> 06:53.038
Sounds like you've been
bitten by the travel bug,
huh?

06:53.038 --> 06:56.750
-Definitely.
-You know a place I love
going?

06:56.750 --> 06:58.668
-What?
-French Guiana.

06:58.668 --> 07:01.880
It's amazing, a little
taste of Europe down south.

07:01.880 --> 07:06.718
-Beautiful beaches,
amazing wines
-Oh, sounds great.

07:06.718 --> 07:08.845
Lisa:
In the Oxford Dictionary,
a mountain is

07:08.845 --> 07:12.640
defined as a natural elevation
of the Earth's surface rising...

07:15.602 --> 07:16.770
There you are.

07:21.108 --> 07:25.028
Yeah, okay. Thanks.

07:25.028 --> 07:27.322
-My resume.
-I'm just in the middle of

07:27.322 --> 07:29.366
something Gerry, okay?
Don't really have time for it

07:29.366 --> 07:31.076
-right now, okay?
-Got it.

07:31.076 --> 07:33.703
-Oh!
-Hey.

07:33.703 --> 07:36.873
Well, hello me.

07:36.873 --> 07:38.917
I feel like I'm looking
in the mirror right now,
are you serious?

07:38.917 --> 07:41.920
-Excuse me?
-Um, Jeff, this is Gerry,

07:41.920 --> 07:43.338
he's one of our social
science teachers

07:43.338 --> 07:46.758
-Oh, hey. Nice to meet you.
-You too, this is...

07:46.758 --> 07:48.927
-I'm sorry
-This is...

07:48.927 --> 07:52.180
-Oh gosh
-Listen, thanks very much

07:52.180 --> 07:53.556
for your time and I look forward
to hearing from you.

07:53.556 --> 07:54.933
-Yeah, great.
-Gerry, nice to meet you.

07:54.933 --> 07:56.935
-See you around?
-Yeah, you know
where you'll see me?

07:56.935 --> 07:59.520
In the mirror.
I've heard of having a twin

07:59.520 --> 08:04.192
in the world, this is insane
that you're right...
we met.

08:04.192 --> 08:06.236
Wait, so Jeff's your twin?

08:06.236 --> 08:09.114
So this fit young guy,

08:09.114 --> 08:14.328
-you're thinking
he's your twin?
-Twin. You can't hire him.

08:14.328 --> 08:15.495
Sorry, there's no way.

08:15.495 --> 08:17.831
-It would be so confusing
for everybody.
-'Cause he's your twin?

08:17.831 --> 08:20.541
-Yeah, exactly.
-Thank you so much.

08:20.541 --> 08:22.669
I so appreciate your time.

08:22.669 --> 08:25.964
-Good luck, man.
-Gerry, good to meet you.

08:27.299 --> 08:29.509
Even our names
sound the same.

08:29.509 --> 08:31.719
What are you
talking about? Jeff, Gerry?

08:31.719 --> 08:33.430
-They don't sound any...
-No, say it fast. Jeff, Gerry.

08:33.430 --> 08:35.140
-Jeff, Gerry.
-Jeff, Gerry. Faster.

08:35.140 --> 08:38.559
-Jeff, Gerry.
-Jeff, Gerry.
Really fast, see?

08:38.559 --> 08:40.854
Well, your twin
was really good.

08:40.854 --> 08:43.357
Well, good, that means I'm
going to be really good.

08:43.357 --> 08:46.360
You can have the real Gerry
or the fake Gerry.

08:48.362 --> 08:55.535
( rap music playing )

09:07.005 --> 09:10.217
Sir, I wanted to talk to
you about the phys-ed posi...

09:10.217 --> 09:13.761
Oh, my gosh!
Those are quite the shorts.

09:13.761 --> 09:16.515
Bobbi's taking care of that.
Look, I was just about

09:16.515 --> 09:18.725
to do some yoga,
helps with my Krav Maga.

09:18.725 --> 09:20.519
Heard baby powder
helps with that too.

09:20.519 --> 09:22.603
Really? Baby powder
helps with Israeli

09:22.603 --> 09:25.940
-martial arts training?
-No, I have not heard that.

09:25.940 --> 09:30.404
Interesting.
Sir, if I get into phys-ed,
I'm gonna do yoga.

09:30.404 --> 09:33.365
-I'm gonna do Krav...
-Krav Maga.

09:33.365 --> 09:37.160
All right, you can stay.
Just be quiet.

09:39.496 --> 09:41.831
Why am I looking at this?

09:45.502 --> 09:48.046
Robert, I think we have
a problem with Rebecca.

09:48.046 --> 09:52.633
-Oh, no, is she in danger?
-No, no. She's not prepared

09:52.633 --> 09:55.387
to teach yet. You're not
honestly gonna give her a good

09:55.387 --> 09:58.306
-evaluation, are you?
-Is she good-looking?

09:58.306 --> 10:01.726
-Oh, yeah.
-There's your answer.

10:01.726 --> 10:06.606
Lisa, look. you don't get
to be vice-principal at Xavier
Academy by playing favorites.

10:06.606 --> 10:09.609
I think you're being
a little hard on Rebecca.

10:09.609 --> 10:13.613
Am I? Because I saw her
this morning

10:13.613 --> 10:16.199
hanging out with
students in the parking lot.

10:16.199 --> 10:18.243
Unbelievable.

10:18.243 --> 10:20.579
That is going above and
beyond the call of duty.

10:20.579 --> 10:23.915
Getting to know
the students like that?
That is so progressive.

10:23.915 --> 10:28.253
She was supposed
to be observing my class.

10:28.253 --> 10:31.381
What if I hold off on
passing any kind of judgment

10:31.381 --> 10:33.633
until Rebecca's finished
her practicum?

10:33.633 --> 10:38.096
Fine. Just, please, be honest
when you evaluate her.

10:38.096 --> 10:41.475
Lisa, you don't
get to be vice principal
at Xavier Academy...

10:41.475 --> 10:44.561
-You already said that, Robert.
-That was for the "don't play
favorites" part.

10:44.561 --> 10:47.188
-This is a different part...
-Yeah, we get that.

10:49.441 --> 10:52.068
-You're so great.
-Mm-hmm.

10:55.071 --> 10:58.199
Done spreading rumors
about Mr. Webster yet?

10:58.199 --> 11:00.535
Sir, I'm just telling you
what I heard. There's Jenna

11:00.535 --> 11:02.703
right over there, you
can go ask her yourself.

11:02.703 --> 11:05.540
Well, I've already told
you, I have no interest in

11:05.540 --> 11:09.544
hearing about this Mr. Webster
with a student. Which one?

11:09.544 --> 11:12.755
Which one...
Which girl?

11:14.257 --> 11:17.594
Hey, wasn't
done talking, Jimmy.

11:17.594 --> 11:22.599
-Ahhhhhh, Jenna Bledsoe?
-I'm Jenna.

11:22.599 --> 11:27.103
Oh, wow...
wow, you're Jenna.

11:27.103 --> 11:29.481
Yes, sir, do you need me
for anything?

11:29.481 --> 11:32.984
So are you related...

11:32.984 --> 11:35.778
are you related
to Drew Bledsoe?

11:35.778 --> 11:38.615
-Quarterback?
-I don't think so.

11:38.615 --> 11:40.575
OK, that was...okay.

11:40.575 --> 11:44.538
I like that, that's
neat, it hurts I bet.

11:45.830 --> 11:48.707
Peace, girls.

11:50.335 --> 11:53.588
What was Webster thinking?

11:53.588 --> 11:57.676
Ms. Lewis will be teaching
our class today so please
pay attention and...

11:57.676 --> 12:02.055
So, without further ado,
Ms. Lewis. Stand up.

12:09.646 --> 12:13.441
Now, watch.
Trust me, I know people.

12:13.441 --> 12:18.279
Okay, class, how much
do you know about Amsterdam?

12:18.279 --> 12:20.657
-Yes?
-It's in the Netherlands.

12:20.657 --> 12:24.327
No, I mean, like how
much do you know
about Amsterdam?

12:24.327 --> 12:26.371
You need to realize you can't

12:26.371 --> 12:28.623
learn everything
from a textbook.

12:28.623 --> 12:32.168
For example,
I was in Amsterdam one summer.

12:32.168 --> 12:35.255
I ended up with no money.
Nothing.

12:35.255 --> 12:38.717
Do you think knowing that
Amsterdam was in the Netherlands

12:38.717 --> 12:40.677
would have helped me?
No.

12:40.677 --> 12:45.390
I made it out of that jam
through hard work
and street smarts

12:45.390 --> 12:49.728
and you know, just being open
to whatever and whoever
came along.

12:49.728 --> 12:52.897
I danced double,
even triple shifts,

12:52.897 --> 12:56.067
I even got used to that red
light in my face all the time.

12:56.067 --> 13:00.905
Within a couple months, I was
finally on my way back home.

13:00.905 --> 13:04.992
Now you show me where it
teaches you any of that

13:04.992 --> 13:06.578
in your
precious textbooks.

13:06.578 --> 13:10.707
Well? Care to apologize?

13:14.127 --> 13:17.380
Hey, we need to move your
interview up to tonight...

13:17.380 --> 13:20.216
-Is that okay with you?
-Yeah. Hey, uh, how are

13:20.216 --> 13:22.594
-the interviews going?
-Yeah, good. Some duds,

13:22.594 --> 13:25.722
-but some good ones too.
-Yeah. How's the guy that...

13:25.722 --> 13:29.309
my, my twin, like the guy that
Jeff, my brother from anoth...

13:29.309 --> 13:32.228
-One of the good ones.
-He was, he was one
of the good.

13:32.228 --> 13:36.190
Wow, that's good for...
well, you got a Jeff...

13:36.190 --> 13:40.695
you got a Jeff already
in the school. So I
could... so it just...

13:40.695 --> 13:43.782
make... it would be
easier 'cause I would...

13:43.782 --> 13:45.742
-Yeah, I got it.
-Cool.

13:45.742 --> 13:50.455
-Your resume was really
impressive Gerry, okay?
-Oh, thank you, Bobbi.

13:50.455 --> 13:52.206
You didn't make any
of that up, did you?

13:52.206 --> 13:56.043
No. No.

13:56.043 --> 14:00.923
I don't, I'm not a skeet
shooter. I didn't, I don't
skeet shoot.

14:00.923 --> 14:05.386
-Yeah, that was the one
I doubted.
-Okay.

14:05.386 --> 14:09.182
( laughing ) Why did
she think I made stuff up?

14:09.182 --> 14:12.143
I might not have been on
the dean's list

14:12.143 --> 14:13.894
every year.

14:17.357 --> 14:20.234
See, at job interviews,
what they do is they try to

14:20.234 --> 14:22.779
trick you, they ask you
"What are your weaknesses?"

14:22.779 --> 14:25.865
I make some up.
"I try too hard.
I care too much."

14:25.865 --> 14:28.993
That way it feels like
a weakness, but it's
a strength.

14:28.993 --> 14:32.330
Just a trick, you can do that.
It's hard when you don't really

14:32.330 --> 14:35.583
-know what your weaknesses are.
-Sir, uh, I could suggest

14:35.583 --> 14:38.127
-some weaknesses for you.
-Okay, give me a weakness.

14:38.127 --> 14:41.339
Uh, you leave in the
middle of the class a lot.

14:41.339 --> 14:46.219
Okay, not a lot, but
I gotta go to
the washroom sometimes.

14:46.219 --> 14:47.928
You get to leave,
why can't I?

14:47.928 --> 14:52.058
-You definitely have ADD.
-ADD is not a weakness.

14:52.058 --> 14:55.019
It's a strength, 'cause I can...
girls, please, back there...

14:55.019 --> 14:57.647
'cause I can think
of many things at once.

14:57.647 --> 14:59.524
See that? I was talking and
then I noticed them.

14:59.524 --> 15:02.985
Stop playing with the paper.
All right? That's a strength.

15:02.985 --> 15:04.571
This is amazing, by the way.

15:09.701 --> 15:12.412
I can't believe how
bright it is. Get me some

15:12.412 --> 15:14.914
-of those highlighters.
-Your tests are too easy.

15:14.914 --> 15:17.500
Jimmy, Jimmy's failing.
Are my tests too easy?

15:17.500 --> 15:21.212
-No.
-No. Unh-unh. Nice try.

15:21.212 --> 15:24.965
-You show a lot of movies.
-You know what?
You talk too much.

15:24.965 --> 15:28.511
That's a weakness.
So if you go to a job
and they say,

15:28.511 --> 15:33.307
"What are your weaknesses, Ben?"
"I talk too much." "See ya."

15:33.307 --> 15:36.143
Write that down. Oh, remember
the other day, everybody,

15:36.143 --> 15:39.480
Maya was talking about
the guy who looked like
a phys-ed teacher?

15:39.480 --> 15:41.733
-He had one arm.
-What's wrong with one arm?

15:41.733 --> 15:44.485
That's not funny,
that's sad,

15:44.485 --> 15:48.239
but he does not look like
a phys-ed teacher with one arm.

15:48.239 --> 15:51.910
So, Maya's weakness
is her eyesight.

15:51.910 --> 15:55.413
Maya... over here.

15:55.413 --> 15:57.916
That's your weakness,

15:57.916 --> 16:02.295
can't see arms on people.

16:02.295 --> 16:05.799
That might cost you a job.

16:05.799 --> 16:10.177
Well, I have written an awful
lot of evaluation letters
in my time

16:10.177 --> 16:12.472
and I'm known for being
a bit of a tough Gus,

16:12.472 --> 16:15.725
but I don't know if I've
ever written a letter that
glows like this one.

16:15.725 --> 16:17.727
Well, thank you, Robert.

16:17.727 --> 16:23.399
And now here we are huh?
After a short, but intense
period,

16:23.399 --> 16:25.819
faced with the difficult
task of having to say...

16:25.819 --> 16:28.613
-Yeah, okay.
-Hey!

16:28.613 --> 16:31.198
Love to hear more about
Amsterdam sometime.

16:31.198 --> 16:34.243
-Heck, we could even go.
-That'd be fun. I'll call you.

16:34.243 --> 16:37.580
Great!

16:37.580 --> 16:39.707
Does she have your number?

16:43.252 --> 16:47.507
-Let me have this.
-Okay.

16:58.142 --> 17:00.019
-Mr. Duncan.
-Hello.

17:02.563 --> 17:06.734
-What's with the flowers?
-Those are for you.

17:06.734 --> 17:10.196
Why would you bring flowers
to a job interview?

17:10.196 --> 17:12.114
Oh, I thought it was
something that was nice...

17:12.114 --> 17:13.908
It's a little
unprofessional.

17:13.908 --> 17:15.910
Yeah, not to
mention sexist, Gerry.

17:15.910 --> 17:19.372
-How is it sexist?
-Well, did you bring any
flowers for Mr. Cheeley?

17:19.372 --> 17:23.417
-Yeah, flowers for me?
-Oh, okay...and I did.

17:25.628 --> 17:29.089
You thought that
you could win me over
by buying me flowers

17:29.089 --> 17:31.759
because I'm a woman?
Okay, that is just sexist.

17:31.759 --> 17:36.347
It's not sexist is you're
a woman on the same team...

17:36.347 --> 17:40.184
-as all the women.
-What?

17:40.184 --> 17:43.021
-What?
-Are you saying

17:43.021 --> 17:47.483
that you think I'm a lesbian?
I mean, the fact that
I have a live-in

17:47.483 --> 17:49.777
boyfriend of eight years that's
not enough of a clue to you?

17:49.777 --> 17:52.655
We read that,
we read that wrong.

17:52.655 --> 17:55.825
Yeah.
Let's get this over with.

17:55.825 --> 17:59.913
Okay. Whew.

18:01.497 --> 18:04.000
Look, Mr. Duncan,
the truth of the matter is

18:04.000 --> 18:06.711
-we're gonna hire Jeff
for the position
-Yeah.

18:06.711 --> 18:12.508
But, I don't...why?
I'm Jeff. You have Jeff in me.

18:12.508 --> 18:16.387
You have me here already.
Have you told him? Can we...

18:16.387 --> 18:19.557
No, no, the reality
of the situation is this...

18:19.557 --> 18:23.143
Oh, I get it...

18:23.143 --> 18:26.647
you hired a guy
that looks like me,

18:26.647 --> 18:30.150
acts like me, is me,

18:30.150 --> 18:33.237
same age as me,
so you wouldn't lose me

18:33.237 --> 18:36.616
in the social sciences
department.

18:36.616 --> 18:39.953
Yeah, that's it.

18:39.953 --> 18:41.788
It would just
be easier for us

18:41.788 --> 18:45.666
to hire a phys-ed teacher
from outside the school than

18:45.666 --> 18:49.796
disrupting the social sciences
department entirely, you know?

18:49.796 --> 18:52.548
-I get it. It makes sense.
-Yeah.

18:52.548 --> 18:55.342
-From your perspective,
that would be a lot easier.
-Yeah.

18:55.342 --> 18:58.846
It's gonna be confusing
for Jeff and me.

19:00.765 --> 19:05.478
Okay, I get it.
Well, I thank you.

19:05.478 --> 19:08.815
Mr. Cheeley, thank you,

19:08.815 --> 19:12.652
and, Ms. Galka, thank you.

19:12.652 --> 19:14.862
All right.

19:16.781 --> 19:21.285
( laughs ) I can't believe
he thought I was a lesbian.

19:21.285 --> 19:23.830
I know, I haven't
thought that for years.

19:23.830 --> 19:26.624
-Ever since I met Craig.
-What, that's when you knew?

19:26.624 --> 19:30.003
Mm-hmm.

19:30.003 --> 19:31.462
Huh.

19:36.509 --> 19:38.845
Hey, I hear we have
a new PE teacher.

19:38.845 --> 19:40.930
Yeah, they couldn't give it
to me 'cause it would have

19:40.930 --> 19:43.349
screwed up the whole social
sciences department, so...

19:43.349 --> 19:45.143
-Oh, well, that's good.
-Have you seen him?

19:45.143 --> 19:48.146
-No, is he cute?
-Oh, you'll see,

19:48.146 --> 19:50.898
not really for me to say,
but you'll understand.

19:50.898 --> 19:53.233
-How old is he?
-Oh, probably about my age,

19:53.233 --> 19:57.196
probably the exact same age...
oh, did you hear Mr. Webster
got fired

19:57.196 --> 19:58.906
-for dating a student?
-What?!

19:58.906 --> 20:01.241
Yeah, Jenna Bledsoe,
have you seen Jenna Bledsoe?

20:01.241 --> 20:04.078
-No.
-If I was gonna lose my
job for dating a student,

20:04.078 --> 20:07.247
it would not be Jenna Bledsoe.

20:07.247 --> 20:10.584
That's, that's gross.
That's really gross.

20:10.584 --> 20:13.295
I'd never do it.
I'm saying if that was...

20:13.295 --> 20:16.674
Bobbi, glad
you fired Mr. Webster.

20:16.674 --> 20:18.968
-Yeah.
-'Cause that was wrong.

20:18.968 --> 20:22.304
No, he didn't get fired,
his wife got transferred
to a new city.

20:24.015 --> 20:26.308
You idiot.

20:27.727 --> 20:30.855
Well, somebody better
tell Jenna Bledsoe.

20:30.855 --> 20:33.315
Poor Jenna.

20:42.324 --> 20:45.244
-Hey!
-Oh, hey, congrats,

20:45.244 --> 20:47.621
-by the way.
-Thanks. Gerry, right?

20:47.621 --> 20:51.042
Yeah, Gerry,
the kids call me Mr. D.

20:51.042 --> 20:53.169
-Yeah.
-You may start getting that.

20:53.169 --> 20:55.171
Well, look, looking forward
to working with you.

20:55.171 --> 20:57.882
It's, ah, first day
tomorrow so I gotta...

20:57.882 --> 20:59.842
Why don't we have
a quick little one-on-one?

20:59.842 --> 21:03.221
Oh, yeah, I'm not really
dressed for it today.

21:03.221 --> 21:06.182
Come on, just one basket.
Come on.

21:06.182 --> 21:10.686
-All right, one basket.
-All right,
age before beauty...

21:10.686 --> 21:14.857
-Yeah, and strength.
-Okay.

21:15.608 --> 21:19.403
Nope, no, no, no, carry.

21:19.403 --> 21:21.405
-You went like that.
-Okay.

21:21.405 --> 21:22.782
-Close.
-All right.

21:22.782 --> 21:26.119
Okay, good try.

21:27.620 --> 21:30.748
Miss, miss, miss,
miss, miss, miss.

21:32.166 --> 21:35.086
Hey, Gerry, thanks a lot,
that was a lot of fun.

21:35.086 --> 21:36.879
That was fun.
That was a blast. Foul.

21:36.879 --> 21:38.256
-That was a foul.
-Later, Gerry.

21:38.256 --> 21:40.174
Okay.

21:42.551 --> 21:44.720
Big time foul.

21:47.014 --> 21:49.267
Damn.

21:49.267 --> 21:52.352
♪ Awesome, awesome,
awesome, awesome ♪

21:52.352 --> 21:54.438
( music playing )
