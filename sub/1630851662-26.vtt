00:29.779 --> 00:31.573
[General Zod]
I have a theory.

00:31.656 --> 00:34.701
You see, Jor-El could've sent
his son to New Genesis.

00:34.784 --> 00:38.371
He had allies there,
but on<i> that</i> world,

00:38.455 --> 00:43.293
his boy would have
been an orphan,
at the mercy of New Gods.

00:43.376 --> 00:46.629
So, instead, Jor-El
chose<i> this</i> world

00:46.713 --> 00:49.924
where his son
could be raised
in benign anonymity,

00:50.008 --> 00:53.303
before rising
to become a god among men.

00:53.386 --> 00:56.139
But where Kal-El, the Superman,

00:56.222 --> 00:59.642
failed to take his place
as humanity's god,

00:59.726 --> 01:04.397
where he failed to rule
and raise your world
to galactic supremacy,

01:04.481 --> 01:08.485
I, General Zod,
will succeed for you all

01:08.568 --> 01:11.070
and a new day will
dawn on this world,

01:11.154 --> 01:14.991
today, re-christened
as New Krypton,

01:15.074 --> 01:19.829
re-christened in the blood
of your failed savior.

01:21.080 --> 01:25.627
Superboy. Execute Kal-El now.

[Ma'alefa'ak]<i> No, no, no!</i>

Sorry, General.
Should have waited
for your troops.

Fine.

14:20.109 --> 14:22.403
So, is it over?

14:22.486 --> 14:24.363
-A little bit. Yeah.
-No.

14:24.446 --> 14:28.075
Lor-Zod just stole
our last chance to
get home to our era.

14:28.158 --> 14:29.535
It's worse than that.

14:29.618 --> 14:31.954
With Lor on the loose
in a Time-Sphere,

14:32.037 --> 14:34.290
we're right back
where we started.

14:34.373 --> 14:38.586
We won the battle,
[sighs] but not the war.

14:49.179 --> 14:51.265

Thanks for asking, Courtney.

14:51.348 --> 14:54.643
I'm still on a leave of absence

15:06.405 --> 15:08.407
What did Gar say
about Superboy?

15:08.490 --> 15:12.620
His hearing
gets more super every day.

15:12.703 --> 15:17.458
Well, son, you remember
what we told you about
Uncle Conner's death?

15:17.541 --> 15:19.168
Uh-huh.

15:19.251 --> 15:23.380
Well, that was all true,
but we made a mistake
about Conner.

15:23.464 --> 15:25.424
He was lost and hurt.

15:25.507 --> 15:28.093
-But we found him alive.
-I knew it.

15:28.177 --> 15:30.262
Well, uh, we didn't.

15:30.346 --> 15:34.642
But we've never been
so glad to be so wrong.

15:34.725 --> 15:37.353
Now, would you like
to see Conner again?

15:37.436 --> 15:41.732
-It wouldn't scare you?
-No! I mean, yeah,
let's see him!

16:56.432 --> 16:58.308
Well, to put it simply,

16:58.392 --> 17:01.770
we need more than
the all-purpose room at
the Youth Center can provide.

17:01.854 --> 17:05.524
We need a place
where our people can
go to escape the Life

17:05.607 --> 17:10.571

Quite the contrary.

to be in love.

she is a Kryptonian,
captured by the Light

27:06.291 --> 27:09.836
and turned over
to Apokolips as tribute.

27:09.919 --> 27:15.467
Decades ago, she was sent
to the Phantom Zone alone.
