WEBVTT

00:06.892 --> 00:07.213
GOOD MORNING, JORDAN.

00:07.293 --> 00:09.359
JEEZ.

00:09.459 --> 00:11.043
SORRY.
YOU SCARED ME.

00:11.143 --> 00:12.607
OH, I DID? MY BAD.

00:12.707 --> 00:13.891
I KNOW I HATE
BEING SCARED.

00:13.991 --> 00:15.335
NO WORRIES, MAN.
YOU'RE GOOD.

00:15.435 --> 00:18.023
NOT A BIG FAN OF
SURPRISES, EITHER.

00:18.123 --> 00:20.750
NO SCARING,
NO SURPRISES.

00:20.850 --> 00:22.355
GOT IT.

00:22.455 --> 00:25.142
OH, AND ALSO,
I DON'T LIKE SECRETS.

00:27.508 --> 00:29.514
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

00:30.597 --> 00:33.104
THAT'S WHY I LIKE YOU, J.

00:33.204 --> 00:35.952
MY BROTHER.
YOU ALWAYS BEEN
UPFRONT WITH ME.

00:36.052 --> 00:37.756
I MEAN, YOU TOLD ME
ABOUT YOU AND LAYLA, RIGHT?

00:37.857 --> 00:39.842
WELL, NOT EXACTLY.

00:39.943 --> 00:41.407
I HAD TO FIGURE IT OUT
FOR MYSELF,

00:41.507 --> 00:43.974
BUT YOU NEVER DENIED IT.
NOW, THAT'S SOMETHING.

00:44.074 --> 00:45.298
[LAUGHS]
RIGHT.

00:45.398 --> 00:48.466
[BOTH CHUCKLE]

00:48.567 --> 00:49.991
LAYLA IS THE ONLY REASON

00:50.091 --> 00:52.036
YOU'RE STAYING
AT GAU, RIGHT?

00:52.137 --> 00:54.924
THERE'S NO OTHER REASON?
JUST YOUNG LOVE?

00:55.025 --> 00:56.489
UM...

00:56.589 --> 00:58.413
SO, YOU DID KNOW YOUR FATHER
TOOK THE COACH JOB.

00:58.513 --> 01:00.099
I KNEW IT. I KNEW IT.

01:00.199 --> 01:01.983
SPENCE, LOOK, I DIDN'T
WANT TO LIE TO YOU, OK?

01:02.083 --> 01:03.628
I TOLD MY DAD YESTERDAY

01:03.728 --> 01:05.312
THAT EITHER HE
TELLS YOU OR I WILL.

01:05.413 --> 01:07.559
YESTERDAY. SO, THAT'S WHEN
YOU FOUND OUT? YESTERDAY?

01:07.658 --> 01:09.202
I WANTED TO TELL YOU,
SPENCE, OK? I DID.

01:09.304 --> 01:10.687
IT'S JUST HE ASKED ME

01:10.788 --> 01:12.452
TO KEEP IT A SECRET.
THAT'S--

01:12.551 --> 01:14.176
WELL, I GUESS A.D. BARNES
DIDN'T GET THE MEMO.

01:14.277 --> 01:16.062
BUT AT LEAST I CAN
COUNT ON SOMEBODY

01:16.161 --> 01:18.750
TO BE HONEST
WITH ME, RIGHT?

01:18.850 --> 01:20.856
JORDAN: SPENCE--
SPENCER: NOPE.

01:25.990 --> 01:27.533
OLIVIA: "KEATING RECORDS
LOST ITS HEART AND SOUL

01:27.633 --> 01:29.298
"WHEN MY DAD
STEPPED DOWN.

01:29.399 --> 01:31.946
"I'M HOPING TO RESTORE
MY FAMILY'S LEGACY

01:32.045 --> 01:33.951
WITH FORMONICA RECORDS."

01:34.050 --> 01:36.478
HA! THIS IS
A GREAT INTERVIEW.

01:36.579 --> 01:38.042
WE SHOULD HANG IT
ON THE FRIDGE.

01:38.143 --> 01:39.646
WAIT. YOU THINK
IT'S FRIDGE-WORTHY?

01:39.746 --> 01:41.693
I MEAN, YOU'RE JUST LUCKY
I DIDN'T WRITE IT,

01:41.792 --> 01:44.381
'CAUSE IT PROBABLY
WOULD'VE BROUGHT DOWN
YOUR ENTIRE EMPIRE.

01:44.481 --> 01:45.905
OK, GARRETT
HAD THAT COMING,

01:46.005 --> 01:47.309
AND WE SHOULD HANG
THAT ARTICLE

01:47.408 --> 01:48.631
ON THE FRIDGE
JUST UNDER MINE.

01:48.732 --> 01:50.676
HOW ABOUT IT GOES
UNDER THE FRIDGE,

01:50.777 --> 01:52.883
BECAUSE IT LITERALLY
RUINED EVERYONE'S LIVES?

01:52.984 --> 01:54.929
EVERYONE IS FINE,
LIV.

01:55.029 --> 01:56.453
YOU KNOW WHAT
YOU SHOULD DO?

01:56.554 --> 01:58.217
GET BACK TOGETHER
WITH SPENCER?

01:58.318 --> 02:00.503
THAT'S NOT EXACTLY
WHERE I WAS GOING, BUT--

02:00.604 --> 02:02.068
THE BREAKUP
WAS SO STUPID.

02:02.167 --> 02:03.753
I MEAN, WE STILL
LOVE EACH OTHER,

02:03.854 --> 02:07.844
AND WHAT'S HER NAME HAS
GOTTA BE A REBOUND, RIGHT?

02:07.945 --> 02:10.049
[SIGHS]
SORRY. THAT CAME
OUTTA NOWHERE.

02:10.150 --> 02:11.896
I JUST NEEDED
TO TELL SOMEONE.

02:11.996 --> 02:13.420
WHAT HAPPENED TO NOAH?

02:13.519 --> 02:14.984
[SIGHS]
HE'S MY COWORKER, LAYLA.

02:15.085 --> 02:16.910
WAIT. DIDN'T WE JUST...

02:17.010 --> 02:18.554
YOU KNOW WHAT?
NEVER MIND.

02:18.655 --> 02:20.198
YOU WANT TO GET BACK
TOGETHER WITH SPENCER,

02:20.299 --> 02:21.643
SO, WHAT IS THE PLAN?

02:21.743 --> 02:23.728
NO CLUE.
YOU THINK I CAN GET HIM

02:23.828 --> 02:25.573
TO START HATING
HIS NEW GIRLFRIEND?

02:25.673 --> 02:28.180
YOU COULD WRITE
AN ARTICLE ABOUT HER.

02:28.281 --> 02:29.465
IT'S TOO SOON?

02:29.565 --> 02:31.570
IT'S NOT A BAD IDEA.

02:34.498 --> 02:36.844
SPENCER: COACH.
KENNY: SPENCE. WHAT'S UP?

02:36.944 --> 02:38.409
DID YOU HEAR ABOUT
THE HEAD COACH POSITION?

02:38.509 --> 02:39.612
NO. NOT YET.

02:39.712 --> 02:41.738
THAT'S 'CAUSE
IT AIN'T YOU.

02:41.838 --> 02:43.422
A.D. BARNES OFFERED IT
TO COACH BAKER.

02:43.522 --> 02:45.749
KENNY: INTERESTING.

02:45.850 --> 02:47.714
SPENCER: THAT'S ALL
YOU GOTTA SAY?

02:47.814 --> 02:49.600
WHAT DO YOU WANT
ME TO SAY, SPENCE?

02:49.700 --> 02:52.648
A.D. BARNES CAN HIRE
WHOMEVER HE WANTS.
WHAT DID BILLY SAY?

02:52.748 --> 02:54.052
I DON'T KNOW.

02:54.152 --> 02:55.857
I DIDN'T HEAR IT FROM HIM.

02:55.957 --> 02:57.862
AND I DON'T SEE THE POINT IN
TALKING TO HIM ABOUT IT NOW.

02:57.962 --> 03:00.549
AND YOU AIN'T
CURIOUS ABOUT HOW
ALL OF THIS WENT DOWN?

03:00.650 --> 03:04.119
HEY, LOOK, SPENCE,
BILLY HELPED
RAISE YOU, MAN.

03:04.219 --> 03:06.847
YOU OWE HIM A CHANCE
TO EXPLAIN HIMSELF.

03:06.947 --> 03:09.674
AND HE DEFINITELY
OWES YOU AN EXPLANATION.

03:17.615 --> 03:20.645
CARDELL SIMMS,
WHY SHOULD YOU GET
CUSTODY OF YOUR DAUGHTER?

03:20.745 --> 03:22.971
YOU JUST SAID WHY. 'CAUSE
SHE'S MY DAMN DAUGHTER.

03:23.072 --> 03:24.496
WHAT EXPERIENCE DO YOU
HAVE WITH CHILDREN?

03:24.596 --> 03:26.020
I USED TO BE ONE.

03:26.120 --> 03:27.664
ALL RIGHT,
LISTEN, PREACH,

03:27.763 --> 03:29.510
I AM ON YOUR SIDE
COMPLETELY,

03:29.609 --> 03:31.996
BUT HER GRANDPARENTS
AND THEIR LAWYERS

03:32.096 --> 03:34.242
ARE GONNA COME AT YOU
VERY HARD.

03:34.341 --> 03:35.886
NOW, YOU AND I
BOTH KNOW THAT

03:35.987 --> 03:37.490
YOUR PAST IS
GONNA BE A PROBLEM.

03:37.590 --> 03:39.617
NOW, WHAT IS YOUR--
YOUR CURRENT PROFESSION?

03:39.716 --> 03:41.582
I TUTOR
AND SUBSTITUTE TEACH

03:41.683 --> 03:43.227

03:43.327 --> 03:44.470
NOTHING FULL-TIME?

03:44.571 --> 03:46.816
WHAT DID I JUST SAY?

03:48.943 --> 03:51.249
NOTHING FULL TIME
AT THE MOMENT.

03:51.349 --> 03:53.174
BUT I GOT TWO DEGREES
WHILE SERVING TIME.

03:53.275 --> 03:54.859
THAT'S GOTTA COUNT
FOR SOMETHING.

03:54.959 --> 03:57.304
I'M SURE IT WILL,
BUT WHAT IS

03:57.405 --> 03:59.311
YOUR CURRENT
LIVING SITUATION?

03:59.411 --> 04:01.597

IT'S A SAFE ENVIRONMENT
TO RAISE A LITTLE GIRL?

04:01.698 --> 04:03.683

TO MY PLACE.

04:03.783 --> 04:06.892

BUT TRUST, SHE'LL
BE SAFE WITH ME.

04:06.992 --> 04:08.215

04:08.316 --> 04:10.702
WHAT YOU WANT ME
TO SAY, HUH?

04:10.802 --> 04:12.588
I'M LUCKY IF I WORK
3 DAYS A WEEK

04:12.688 --> 04:14.192
AND I LIVE IN
A CRAPPY APARTMENT?

04:14.292 --> 04:15.998
NO, I DON'T, BRO,
BUT THERE ARE

04:16.098 --> 04:17.360
THINGS YOU COULD DO
TO SHOW THE COURT

04:17.461 --> 04:19.046
THAT YOU ARE SERIOUS,
ALL RIGHT,

04:19.146 --> 04:20.930
AND THEY'RE GONNA
WANT TO DO AN INSPECTION.

04:21.031 --> 04:22.455
THEY NOT GONNA LIKE
WHAT THEY SEE.

04:22.555 --> 04:24.140
WELL, TOO BAD
I CAN'T AFFORD TO MOVE

04:24.240 --> 04:26.105

- LET ME GUESS.

TO CHECK ON ME.

04:45.979 --> 04:48.125
NO. I WAS JUST...

04:48.226 --> 04:49.449
OK, HE MAY HAVE
MENTIONED YOU WERE HERE,

04:49.549 --> 04:51.695
BUT COMING OVER
WAS MY IDEA.

04:51.796 --> 04:53.380
SO, HOW ARE YOU FEELING?

04:53.480 --> 04:55.386
I'M GOOD.
THEY GOT THE INFLAMMATION

04:55.486 --> 04:56.790
IN MY LUNGS
UNDER CONTROL

04:56.890 --> 04:58.032
AND THE NEW MEDS
SHOULD KEEP IT THAT WAY.

04:58.132 --> 04:59.316
GOOD.

TO CONVINCE ASHER.

WORRIED ABOUT YOU.

05:04.029 --> 05:05.574
HE DOESN'T WANT ME MOVING

05:05.674 --> 05:07.338
AND DEFINITELY DOESN'T
WANT ME GOING BACK TO WORK.

05:07.438 --> 05:09.785
UH, WELL, I'M KIND OF
WITH ASHER ON THAT,

05:09.885 --> 05:11.630

BACK TO WORK BIT.

A LITTLE SOON?

05:13.295 --> 05:15.401

MUCH CHOICE.

COVERING HALF MY BILLS,

IS JUICIER THAN MY SOAPS.

25:31.389 --> 25:32.853
ALL YOU NEED NOW IS
AN EVIL TWIN.

25:32.954 --> 25:34.056
THAT WOULD BE LIV.

25:34.156 --> 25:35.742
BUT MY FAVOURITE STORYLINE

25:35.841 --> 25:38.989
IS THIS SEXY, SECRET TRYST
YOU HAVE WITH LAYLA.

25:39.089 --> 25:41.556
OK, I HAVE DEFINITELY
TOLD YOU TOO MUCH.

25:41.657 --> 25:44.003
HOW ABOUT YOU JUST WATCH
ME DO SOME MORE PULL-UPS?

25:44.103 --> 25:45.969
OH, NO. NO, WE AIN'T
SHUTTING THIS OFF,

25:46.070 --> 25:48.014
NOT WITH THE ARRIVAL
OF LAYLA'S VENGEFUL EX.

25:48.114 --> 25:49.579
OK, CLAY IS NOT HER EX.

25:49.679 --> 25:51.864
OK, THEY JUST...

25:51.965 --> 25:53.550
HE'S NOT HER EX,
ALL RIGHT?

25:53.650 --> 25:56.719
BUT YOU SHOULD HEAR
THE WAY HE TALKS TO HER.

25:56.819 --> 25:58.243
HONEY, I DON'T NEED TO.

25:58.341 --> 25:59.847
I'VE BEEN AROUND A LONG TIME

25:59.946 --> 26:01.812
AND DATED MORE MEN THAN
YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT.

26:01.913 --> 26:03.898
DISRESPECT AIN'T
NOTHING NEW.

26:03.998 --> 26:05.704
I MEAN, LAYLA'S
MADE IT PRETTY CLEAR

26:05.804 --> 26:07.589
THAT SHE DOESN'T WANT
ME TO BREAK HIS JAW,

26:07.687 --> 26:09.754
BUT I CAN'T JUST SIT
THERE AND WATCH HIM
TREAT HER LIKE DIRT.

26:09.855 --> 26:11.518
YOU KNOW YOU DON'T
HAVE TO THROW HANDS

26:11.619 --> 26:13.565
TO MAKE
YOUR PRESENCE KNOWN.

26:13.666 --> 26:15.170
LAYLA'S YOUR QUEEN...

26:15.268 --> 26:16.172
MM-HMM.

26:16.272 --> 26:17.897
SO YOU CAN BE HER KNIGHT

26:17.998 --> 26:19.821
AND SWING YOUR
LITTLE SWORD AROUND,

26:19.922 --> 26:22.429
OR YOU CAN BE HER KING

26:22.530 --> 26:26.079
AND STAND BY HER SIDE
BUT ALSO HAVE HER BACK.

26:26.179 --> 26:28.085
HMM.

26:28.185 --> 26:30.492
LAYLA: HEY, WHY ARE
YOU BEING SO PETTY?

26:30.591 --> 26:32.016
IS IT BECAUSE
I BROKE UP WITH YOU?

26:32.114 --> 26:33.540
DID I BRUISE
YOUR FRAGILE EGO?

26:33.641 --> 26:35.384
HA HA!
IS THAT WHAT YOU THINK?

26:35.484 --> 26:38.915
GOD, SOMETIMES I FORGET
HOW YOUNG YOU ARE.

26:39.014 --> 26:41.643
BUT HERE YOU ARE
ACTING LIKE A CHILD.

26:41.743 --> 26:43.728
CLAY, YOU GO AFTER
EVERY CLIENT I WANT

26:43.829 --> 26:45.292
AND YOU SLANDER
MY ARTISTS ONLINE,

26:45.393 --> 26:46.777
AND SOMEHOW
I'M THE CHILD?

26:46.877 --> 26:49.503
THAT WAS BUSINESS,
BUT YOU TAKE IT PERSONALLY

26:49.603 --> 26:51.119
BECAUSE YOU'RE
A SPOILED LITTLE BRAT

26:51.129 --> 26:53.394
WHO'S STILL UPSET THAT DADDY
DIDN'T GIVE HER HIS COMPANY.

26:53.497 --> 26:55.682
KEATING IS NOT
YOUR NAME, CLAY.

26:55.782 --> 26:57.325
AND KEATING RECORDS
ISN'T YOUR LEGACY.

26:57.426 --> 26:58.649
LIKE, DON'T YOU
WANT YOUR OWN?

26:58.749 --> 26:59.575
DON'T YOU?

26:59.676 --> 27:01.981
YEAH, THAT'S WHY
I STARTED FORMONICA
RECORDS. I...

27:02.081 --> 27:04.347
[SIGHS]

27:04.447 --> 27:06.354
YOU KNOW WHAT?

27:06.452 --> 27:08.158
I'M TIRED OF FIGHTING.

27:08.258 --> 27:11.167
OK? THE MUSIC INDUSTRY
IS TOUGH ENOUGH AS IT IS

27:11.265 --> 27:13.452
WITHOUT THE TWO OF US
SABOTAGING EACH OTHER.

27:13.552 --> 27:15.216
OK, WE'RE BOTH REALLY
GOOD AT WHAT WE DO,

27:15.318 --> 27:17.582
AND WE SHOULD BE
BOOSTING EACH OTHER UP,

27:17.684 --> 27:19.470
NOT WHATEVER THIS IS.

27:19.568 --> 27:21.595
SO I WILL STOP
USING MY NAME.

27:21.693 --> 27:24.101
OK? YOU WIN.

27:27.952 --> 27:29.818
UHH!

27:29.918 --> 27:31.702
WHEN DID I GO FROM BEING
YOUR FRIEND TO YOUR PROJECT?

27:31.802 --> 27:33.265
PROBABLY AROUND
THE SAME TIME

27:33.367 --> 27:34.952
I WENT FROM BEING
YOURS TO COACH ASHER.

27:35.052 --> 27:37.197
HO HO HO.
SOME FRIEND.

27:37.298 --> 27:39.405
I GOT YOU THE JOB
WITH COACH MR. MONTES,

27:39.504 --> 27:42.972
AND YOU TRIED TO REPLACE
ME WITH THAT JABARI KID.

27:43.072 --> 27:44.577
I WOULDN'T HAVE
NEEDED TO

27:44.677 --> 27:46.222
IF YOU WEREN'T OUT
PARTYING ALL THE TIME.

27:46.322 --> 27:47.908
IT'S OFFSEASON!

27:48.008 --> 27:50.033
I AM SO SICK OF
THAT LAME EXCUSE.

27:50.133 --> 27:54.164
YOU NEVER APOLOGISED FOR
SETTING MY FURBIES ON FIRE.

27:54.264 --> 27:56.552
[BOTH GRUNT]

27:57.715 --> 27:59.720
DUDE, WE WERE 8.

28:00.763 --> 28:02.024
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.

28:02.126 --> 28:03.551
YOU DIDN'T CARE
ABOUT ME THEN,

28:03.649 --> 28:04.955
AND YOU DON'T
CARE ABOUT ME NOW.

28:05.053 --> 28:06.519
YOU DON'T THINK
I CARE?

28:06.619 --> 28:09.005
EVERYTHING I'VE DONE
IS BECAUSE I CARE.

28:09.106 --> 28:10.889
IF I'M SUCH A BAD GUY,
WHY DID YOU BID ON ME?

28:10.990 --> 28:12.374
WHY NOT JUST DONATE
THE MONEY AND WALK AWAY?

28:12.475 --> 28:16.206
BECAUSE I MISSED YOU.
ALL RIGHT?

28:17.649 --> 28:20.758
LOOK, IF I'M SUCH
A BAD GUY,

28:20.856 --> 28:22.861
WHY'D YOU AGREE
TO HANG OUT?

28:24.068 --> 28:26.434
'CAUSE I MISSED YOU, TOO.

28:29.399 --> 28:30.342
WHOO!

28:30.443 --> 28:32.188
[LAUGHS]
FEEL BETTER?

28:32.289 --> 28:33.514
[SIGHS]
MUCH.

28:33.611 --> 28:36.159
YEAH? GOOD.
[CHUCKLES]

28:36.260 --> 28:38.086
WANTED TO GET
MY MONEY'S WORTH.

28:38.186 --> 28:41.495
UH, AND SORRY ABOUT
OUTBIDDING ALICIA TODAY.

28:41.595 --> 28:43.177
I WASN'T TRYING
TO GET YOU IN TROUBLE.

28:43.280 --> 28:46.707
I JUST...WANTED TO HELP YOU
GET YOU OUT OF YOUR FUNK.

28:46.809 --> 28:49.397
WELL,
MISSION ACCOMPLISHED.

28:49.497 --> 28:53.327
LOOK, UM, I KNOW WHAT
MY DAD DID HURT YOU.

28:53.427 --> 28:57.338
I GET IT. AND I GUARANTEE
THAT MY DAD GETS IT, TOO.

28:57.437 --> 28:59.345
WHY CAN'T PEOPLE
JUST BE HONEST WITH ME?

28:59.443 --> 29:01.450
BECAUSE PEOPLE DON'T WANT
TO LET YOU DOWN.

29:03.336 --> 29:05.562
YOU KNOW,
IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT,

29:05.662 --> 29:07.164
I SHOULD BE MAD, TOO.

29:07.264 --> 29:08.850
I MEAN, MY ARTICLE
IS THE ONLY REASON THAT

29:08.950 --> 29:11.859
THAT JOB'S EVEN AVAILABLE
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

29:11.957 --> 29:13.822
AND I DIDN'T EVEN
GET A THANK YOU.

29:13.923 --> 29:15.307
YOU WANT ME TO BOOK
ANOTHER HOUR IN HERE?

29:15.408 --> 29:17.312
YEAH. I DO.

29:17.414 --> 29:18.878
[LAUGHS]

29:18.976 --> 29:21.283
YOU KNOW MY DAD, SPENCER.

29:21.385 --> 29:23.129
HE'S AN AMBITIOUS GUY.

29:23.229 --> 29:25.095
IT'S HOW HE GOT
INTO THE NFL.

29:25.193 --> 29:28.624
HIS WHOLE LIFE'S
BEEN ABOUT FOOTBALL.

29:28.725 --> 29:33.479
BUT THE ONE THING
THAT HE CARES ABOUT
MORE THAN THE GAME

29:33.577 --> 29:34.963
IS FAMILY,

29:35.062 --> 29:37.068
AND THAT INCLUDES YOU.

29:38.311 --> 29:39.215
TALK TO HIM.

29:39.313 --> 29:40.697
I DID, LIV.

29:40.798 --> 29:43.947
I SAID TALK, NOT YELL.

29:44.046 --> 29:46.234
HAVE AN ACTUAL CONVERSATION.

29:46.332 --> 29:49.522
YOU CAN STILL SAY EVERYTHING
THAT YOU NEED TO SAY,

29:49.622 --> 29:52.850
JUST CALMLY.

29:52.952 --> 29:54.456
WELL, I AIN'T GOT THE
ENERGY FOR MUCH ELSE, SO...

29:54.552 --> 29:56.059
YEAH, WELL, THANK YOU,
RAGE ROOM.

29:56.158 --> 29:57.624
NO.

29:57.725 --> 29:59.729
THANK YOU.

30:00.894 --> 30:02.899
I NEEDED THIS.

30:06.389 --> 30:08.394
I NEEDED THIS, TOO.

30:11.202 --> 30:13.206
LOOK AT THAT.

30:14.169 --> 30:16.794
IT'S FINALLY HAPPENED.

30:16.896 --> 30:20.265
WE'RE FINALLY LEARNING
HOW TO BE FRIENDS AGAIN.

30:33.664 --> 30:36.090
MAN, I WAS BEGINNING
TO THINK YOU WASN'T
GONNA SHOW.

30:36.188 --> 30:37.452
YOU STRAIGHT?

30:37.552 --> 30:38.976
I'M GOOD.

30:39.077 --> 30:41.325
LET ME KNOW
WHEN YOU'RE DONE.

30:48.423 --> 30:50.889
I STILL CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU'RE MAD ABOUT
THE FURBIES.

30:50.990 --> 30:53.216
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU
STILL WON'T ADMIT
YOU DID IT ON PURPOSE.

30:53.318 --> 30:54.903
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.

30:55.001 --> 30:56.706
BUT I AM SORRY.

30:56.807 --> 30:59.754
HOW DO YOU ACCIDENTALLY
SET A GAGGLE OF FURBIES
ON FIRE?

30:59.854 --> 31:03.966
BUT I ACCEPT
YOUR APOLOGY ANYWAY.

31:04.066 --> 31:06.013
WHILE I'M AT IT,

31:06.111 --> 31:08.019
SORRY THAT I'VE BEEN
SO JUDGMENTAL.

31:08.119 --> 31:10.947
I'LL STOP BREATHING
DOWN YOUR NECK.

31:11.044 --> 31:13.072
YEAH, I'M SORRY, TOO.

31:13.169 --> 31:15.999
I KNOW HOW IMPORTANT
COACHING IS TO YOU.

31:16.100 --> 31:17.926
YOU SHOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE
TO DEPEND ON ME.

31:18.024 --> 31:20.091
EH, IT'S OFFSEASON.

31:20.191 --> 31:22.697
[LAUGHS]
OK. LAME EXCUSE.

31:22.798 --> 31:25.066
HEY, FROM NOW ON,
I'M GONNA SHOW YOU
WHAT I'M MADE OF.

YOU'RE MADE OF, MAN.

ELSE TO SEE IT, TOO.

'CAUSE IT DIDN'T HAPPEN.

31:38.481 --> 31:39.865
I'M SORRY,
WHAT DIDN'T HAPPEN?

31:39.966 --> 31:41.711
THAT THING YOU
AND COOP WAS SWEATIN'.

31:41.811 --> 31:43.755
FIGURED THAT'S WHY YOU
WANTED ME TO STOP BY.

31:43.856 --> 31:46.322
I'M PROUD OF YOU, PREACH.

31:46.423 --> 31:48.289
I'M HAPPY TO HEAR THAT.

31:48.389 --> 31:50.414
THAT'S NOT WHY I HAD
YOU COME IN, THOUGH.

31:50.514 --> 31:52.921
FOLLOW ME.

31:59.379 --> 32:02.128
WHAT'S THIS?

32:02.226 --> 32:04.231

32:05.475 --> 32:07.822
YOU KNOW I THOUGHT BILLY
WAS CRAZY FOR BRINGING YOU IN,

32:07.923 --> 32:09.668
BUT YOU PROVED ME WRONG.

32:09.765 --> 32:12.475
AND WITH ALL THE EXTRA HOURS
YOU'VE PUT IN HERE,

32:12.575 --> 32:14.880
PLUS YOUR BACHELOR'S
IN ENGLISH,

PREPARED TO OFFER YOU

YOU DESERVE THIS.

32:37.926 --> 32:39.872
AND IT DIDN'T EVEN TAKE MUCH
FOR ME TO CONVINCE THEM.

32:39.970 --> 32:42.236
OH, YOU DIDN'T
CONVINCE THEM AT ALL.

32:42.338 --> 32:45.126
IT WAS HIS HARD WORK
AND DEDICATION THAT
SPOKE FOR ITSELF.

32:45.225 --> 32:46.649
RIGHT.
BUT I'M THE ONE THAT--

JUST LIKE THAT?

34:14.912 --> 34:16.457
NOT ABOUT EVERYTHING.

34:16.555 --> 34:18.582
BUT YOU'RE RIGHT ABOUT
KEATING RECORDS.

34:18.680 --> 34:21.229
IT ISN'T MY LEGACY,
BUT IT IS MY LABEL NOW,

34:21.327 --> 34:22.792
SO WHY AM I USING
SOMEONE ELSE'S NAME?

34:22.894 --> 34:24.961
BECAUSE KEATING RECORDS
IS A POWERHOUSE

34:25.060 --> 34:26.604
AND YOU'D BE DUMB
NOT TO USE IT.

34:26.702 --> 34:28.711
NOT IF I WANT
MY OWN LEGACY.

34:30.073 --> 34:31.537
THE NAME IS YOURS.

OF MY P.R. DEPARTMENT.

I EXPECT YOU TO BE THERE,

SHOULD HELP EACH OTHER OUT.

NEVER MIND.

TO YOU.

THAT LAYLA CAN
HANDLE HERSELF, OK,

BE A VERY
GOOD...FRIEND

SOMETHING.
