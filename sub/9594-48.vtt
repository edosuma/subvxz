WEBVTT

00:28.629 --> 00:31.532
Whoa! Is Beast Boy
actually doing the dishes?

00:31.565 --> 00:34.635
Of course not.
I don't do dishes. Ha!

00:34.668 --> 00:36.804
But these pots
sound pretty good, yo,

00:36.837 --> 00:39.740
so I'm thinking about
starting a dish-band.
Who's with me?

00:39.773 --> 00:42.176
Ooh! I wish to play
the spoons.

00:42.210 --> 00:43.411
I wanna be on pots!

00:43.444 --> 00:45.813
I'm on jugs and lead vocals!

00:45.846 --> 00:47.248
How about you, Ray

00:47.281 --> 00:48.549
No, and keep the noise down.

00:48.582 --> 00:50.084
No problem, mama.

00:50.118 --> 00:51.152
You guys ready?

00:51.185 --> 00:52.620
Please don't practice here.

00:52.653 --> 00:54.622
And a one, two, three!

00:57.758 --> 01:01.529
* Step by step
is the only conclusion

01:01.562 --> 01:05.233
* Day by day
we are left in confusion

01:05.266 --> 01:07.601
* Bring on the night!

01:08.869 --> 01:11.139
* Bring on the night!

01:12.440 --> 01:15.176
* Bring it on! Bring it on!
Yeah! *

01:19.513 --> 01:21.682
Do you guys always
have to be this loud?

01:21.715 --> 01:24.452
No way! We can be louder!

01:27.488 --> 01:29.457
I'd give anything for silence.

01:33.161 --> 01:34.762
Whoa! Who are you?

01:36.797 --> 01:38.732
I am The Whisperer.

01:38.766 --> 01:40.468
Who?

01:40.501 --> 01:42.336
I am The Whisperer.

01:42.370 --> 01:43.871
Okay, you're gonna
have to speak up.

01:43.904 --> 01:46.440
But this is as loud
as I can speak.

01:46.474 --> 01:47.608
Can you hear me now?

01:47.641 --> 01:49.743
I guess, but why do you
have to whisper?

01:50.711 --> 01:53.581
Because I am The Whisperer.

01:53.614 --> 01:55.283
Oh. What are you doing here?

01:55.316 --> 01:58.619
Like you, I prefer the quiet.

01:58.652 --> 02:00.854
It would be nice to have
a little peace and quiet,

02:00.888 --> 02:03.257
but even my magic's
not that strong.

02:03.291 --> 02:04.525
Mine is.

02:04.558 --> 02:07.495
I can give you
the silence you seek.

02:07.528 --> 02:10.364
I only ask for
one thing in return.

02:10.398 --> 02:13.234
Well, I don't have a soul,
if that's what you're after.

02:13.267 --> 02:15.369
It's not your soul I want.

02:16.537 --> 02:18.839
It's some tummy tickles.

02:18.872 --> 02:20.408
Eh, okay.

02:21.342 --> 02:23.211
Come on now. Get in there.

02:23.244 --> 02:25.613
You want some quiet,
don't you

02:25.646 --> 02:27.615
Oh! That's it!
Yeah. Get the quiet.

02:27.648 --> 02:31.419
Okay, okay,
behind the ears now.

02:31.452 --> 02:33.221
Now, that wasn't
part of the deal.

02:33.254 --> 02:34.822
No, it wasn't.

02:46.300 --> 02:47.901
Enjoy the silence.

03:48.161 --> 03:50.998
Just a little joke of mine,
you probably don't get it.

03:51.031 --> 03:55.769
So, Raven, are you enjoying
the silence you wished for?

03:57.838 --> 03:59.907
This was my evil plan
of course.

03:59.940 --> 04:05.479
For eons I've been trying
to rid the world of sound
so I could finally be heard.

04:05.513 --> 04:09.049
All I needed was a half-demon
to tickle my tummy tum-tums,

04:09.082 --> 04:11.385
and that was you, Raven.

04:12.586 --> 04:14.722
Now listen to how loud I am.

04:14.755 --> 04:17.325
You may want to
cover your ears.

04:17.358 --> 04:18.926
Okay, I'm going to scream now.

04:22.463 --> 04:23.564
Oh, I can't hear you.

04:25.098 --> 04:26.534
I don't understand.

04:26.567 --> 04:28.836
Are you hungry?
You want to go outside?

04:28.869 --> 04:29.903
What?

04:31.038 --> 04:32.940
Okay, just write it down
or something.

04:37.478 --> 04:40.047
"Azarath Metrion Zinthos"?

04:42.082 --> 04:45.052
Gotcha! The rest of the world
may still be silent,

04:45.085 --> 04:47.521
but at least we have
our voices back.

04:47.555 --> 04:49.056
Oh, yeah!

04:50.824 --> 04:53.427
Yeah!

04:53.461 --> 04:54.928
Yes!

04:56.564 --> 04:58.399
And I immediately regret it.

04:58.432 --> 04:59.900
You should.

04:59.933 --> 05:03.671
Silence is a gift
and you pooped on it.

05:04.605 --> 05:06.039
Great job, Raven.

05:06.073 --> 05:07.941
Why don't you just tickle
every tummy you come across?

05:07.975 --> 05:09.943
Well, it seemed like
a good deal at the time.

05:09.977 --> 05:12.413
How is a world
without sound a good deal?

05:12.446 --> 05:16.617
Yeah! How am I going
to know if I've got
a squeaky hinge

05:16.650 --> 05:20.087
Will I never again
hear the meows of the
sweet, sweet kitties?

05:20.120 --> 05:22.690
Well, maybe if you all
weren't so loud all the time,

05:22.723 --> 05:24.124
I wouldn't have
made this deal.

05:24.157 --> 05:25.926
Oh, it's okay, mama,

05:25.959 --> 05:28.462
there's at least
one good thing
that came out of this.

05:28.496 --> 05:29.730
What?

05:33.834 --> 05:36.704
Silent but deadly
has a new meaning, yo!

05:36.737 --> 05:38.406
Ow!

05:41.475 --> 05:42.910
Guys, check this out!

05:42.943 --> 05:44.778
Boing!

05:44.812 --> 05:46.547
You were just
making that noise.

05:46.580 --> 05:48.649
No! I'm not! Look!

05:48.682 --> 05:50.618
Boing!

05:50.651 --> 05:52.620
That's so trippy, yo!

05:52.653 --> 05:55.989
How is the Cyborg mouth sound
coming from that spring?

05:56.023 --> 05:58.959
Well, I was just
hanging out in my room,
missing sound and all,

05:58.992 --> 06:02.162
so I started creating
my own sound effects.

06:02.195 --> 06:03.631
Whoa!

06:03.664 --> 06:06.867
-That is so good!

06:06.900 --> 06:09.470
So, I started to flick
this spring while saying,

06:09.503 --> 06:10.838
-"Boing!"
-Boing!

06:10.871 --> 06:13.874
And after a while, it made
the sound on its own!

06:14.508 --> 06:15.609
That's amazing.

06:15.643 --> 06:16.877
It sure is.

06:16.910 --> 06:18.679
Can you do a water sprinkler,
Cyborg?

06:18.712 --> 06:19.880
Please.

06:19.913 --> 06:22.816
(MIMICKING
WATER SPRINKLER SPRAYING)

06:26.186 --> 06:27.788
Ooh! Do the bull frog.

06:30.524 --> 06:34.495
No, I meant it's amazing
the sound he made
printed onto the object.

06:34.528 --> 06:36.964
It seems The Whisperer
has created a sound vacuum

06:36.997 --> 06:39.433
to which we can assign
our own sounds.

06:39.467 --> 06:40.601
You mean we can replace

06:40.634 --> 06:41.902
the missing sounds
in the world?

06:41.935 --> 06:45.473
Then, Titans,
let's make sounds.

06:47.808 --> 06:49.176
Crack!

06:49.209 --> 06:50.210
Whack!

06:50.243 --> 06:51.479
Smack!

06:51.512 --> 06:52.946
Crack-a-lacka-smack-smack!

06:56.083 --> 06:57.851
Hey, hey, hey!

06:58.919 --> 07:00.654
Hey, hey, hey!

07:00.688 --> 07:01.789
It's working!

07:05.959 --> 07:08.662
-Bam!
-Bam! Bam!

07:21.041 --> 07:23.243
Ha! We did it, Titans!

07:24.712 --> 07:26.246
-Ew.

07:26.279 --> 07:29.683
Really, Beast Boy?
You had to make punches
sound like farts?

07:31.251 --> 07:34.622
So much better than
how it used to sound, bro!

07:34.655 --> 07:35.789
-Ow!

07:35.823 --> 07:38.091
Hilarious.

07:38.125 --> 07:41.128
If punches sound like farts,
what do farts sound like?

07:46.366 --> 07:50.270
Titans, just listen
to the world of sound
we've created!

07:50.303 --> 07:51.605
Blah!

07:51.639 --> 07:53.240
Booyah! Booyah! Booyah!

07:54.875 --> 07:57.645
-I don't like this.
-Yes, it is the bad.

07:57.678 --> 07:58.846
Then there's only one option.

08:00.614 --> 08:02.082
We must make
the dangerous journey
to The Whisperer

08:02.115 --> 08:04.484
and force her to release
the world's sounds.

08:16.764 --> 08:18.832
Rawr! Rawr!

08:27.908 --> 08:30.043
Hoot-hoot! Hoot-hoot!

08:33.046 --> 08:34.147
Cheese!

08:38.819 --> 08:40.654
We're being watched.

08:42.189 --> 08:45.559
Aw, dude, there's a little
kitty-kitty-kitty over there.

08:45.593 --> 08:46.994
I'm gonna go say hi.

08:48.962 --> 08:50.297
Ahh! It's a monster!

08:50.330 --> 08:52.633
Why did you make it
sound like a sweet kitty?

08:52.666 --> 08:54.001
Why?

08:54.034 --> 08:57.170
It was the judgment call!
I am sorry!

08:57.204 --> 08:59.907
Help me!
Punch it or something!

09:01.609 --> 09:02.743
Titans, go!

09:02.776 --> 09:03.977
-Ahh!

09:05.312 --> 09:07.014
Oh, man, it's so funny!

09:07.047 --> 09:09.282
Ow! Get it off of me!

09:24.097 --> 09:26.934
Tip-toe, tip-toe, tip-toe.

09:27.868 --> 09:29.369
Spwa! Shwa!

09:29.402 --> 09:33.240
THE WHISPERER:
Nice try, but I heard you
coming a mile away.

09:33.273 --> 09:35.108
-Whisperer.

09:35.142 --> 09:37.678
We've filled the world up
with our own sounds,

09:37.711 --> 09:40.147
so there's no point in holding
the real ones hostage.

09:40.180 --> 09:42.750
I actually like
what you've done.

09:42.783 --> 09:46.887
It's so bad, it'll encourage
people to stay quiet.

09:46.920 --> 09:49.256
I guess the one thing
you don't know
about the Titans

09:49.289 --> 09:51.124
is that we're loud and proud!

09:51.158 --> 09:53.026
-Hit it!

09:56.029 --> 09:57.731
From the tiggity-top!

09:57.765 --> 10:00.333
One, two, three, four!

10:09.309 --> 10:11.278
TITANS:
* Bring on the night!

10:11.311 --> 10:14.414
No! No! So terrible!

10:14.447 --> 10:16.083
Even worse than before!

10:16.116 --> 10:18.886
Oh, here, take your sounds.

10:18.919 --> 10:20.253
Shwa!

10:21.154 --> 10:22.222
Spling!

10:24.692 --> 10:25.859
Blah!

10:27.761 --> 10:28.862
Booyah! Booyah! Booyah!

10:29.963 --> 10:31.264
Hey, hey, hey.

10:31.298 --> 10:32.632
Hey, hey, hey...

10:38.305 --> 10:41.274
Sorry, guys, I was wrong
when I thought
I wanted silence.

10:41.308 --> 10:45.278
But hey, looks like
all the sounds made it back
to their proper places.

10:45.312 --> 10:46.880
Not all of 'em.

10:48.448 --> 10:50.383
-CYBORG: Come on!

10:50.417 --> 10:52.452
Warn somebody!
