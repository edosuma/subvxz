she'll never say what you want.

No, no, Deej, I appreciate the offer,

01:40.850 --> 01:44.020
but tonight is going to be
Danielle's first bite of solid food,

01:44.104 --> 01:45.897
and I want to be the one
to cook it for her.

12:31.667 --> 12:33.753
Good morrow.

12:38.632 --> 12:39.842
Wrong turkey.

12:47.266 --> 12:50.978
We presenteth thee
A Thanksgiving Pageant, in one part,

12:51.061 --> 12:52.897
by Fernando and the Gibbler Players.

12:55.649 --> 12:59.779
Look, before you guys get too deep into
The Handmaid's Tale, or whatever this is--

13:00.362 --> 13:02.281
[all] Blessed be the fruit.

13:04.742 --> 13:08.162
Okay, have you seen
or heard from Dad and the guys?

13:10.498 --> 13:13.542
The question and answer period
will begin after the performance,

13:13.626 --> 13:16.420
so please hold all questions
for the next 45 minutes.

13:17.671 --> 13:21.759
-Don't forget about the puppet show.
-Right. The next hour and 45 minutes.

13:24.261 --> 13:27.848
The year is 1620.

13:27.973 --> 13:29.642
It's the first Thanksgiving

13:29.725 --> 13:34.271
and light snow is falling
upon Plymouth Rock.

13:37.817 --> 13:41.195
Don't mind me, I'm just going to plug in
this really loud blender.

13:42.071 --> 13:42.988
[loud whirring]

13:43.072 --> 13:44.615
[whirring stops]

13:44.949 --> 13:47.076
[gasps] She blocked the sun.

13:47.993 --> 13:49.078
She's a witch.

13:52.706 --> 13:55.501
I tripped the breaker, okay?
I'm going to go upstairs.

13:56.836 --> 13:57.753
Egad!

13:57.920 --> 13:59.547
The witch is escaping.

14:00.714 --> 14:02.466
Husband, fetch the musket.

14:05.261 --> 14:06.679
Hey, Deej?

14:06.929 --> 14:08.681
Where's the circuit breaker again?

14:10.057 --> 14:11.308
Hey!

14:11.642 --> 14:12.476
What's going on?

14:12.810 --> 14:13.978
It's so weird.

14:14.061 --> 14:16.313
I plugged in one appliance
and the lights went out.

14:16.397 --> 14:18.941
That usually only happens
when there's a bunch of stuff plugged in.

14:20.651 --> 14:22.403
That is weird.

14:22.486 --> 14:25.322
So very weird.

14:27.116 --> 14:28.033
Hmm.

14:28.117 --> 14:29.243
It smells so good up here.

14:29.660 --> 14:30.911
Yeah, it's your food.

14:31.161 --> 14:32.621
It's wafting.

14:34.748 --> 14:37.376
It's so weird, though. I didn't smell it
all the way up the stairs.

14:38.544 --> 14:39.920
Well, it travels in pockets. It...

14:40.004 --> 14:40.838
[sniffs]

14:41.088 --> 14:43.132
It finds the nose.
That's how wafting works.

14:44.341 --> 14:45.342
[clattering]

14:45.551 --> 14:47.761
-What was that?
-No, I wouldn't go in there.

14:48.304 --> 14:50.931
Max can't find his holiday vest.

14:51.015 --> 14:52.016
He's a wreck.

14:53.058 --> 14:56.228
Oh, let me go talk to him.
I know how to get through to the kid.

14:56.770 --> 14:57.730
No, no, no, no. No.

14:57.813 --> 15:01.233
There's also a problem with the bow tie.
He's out of control.

15:02.735 --> 15:05.195
Yeah, I will take care
of the circuit breaker.

15:05.279 --> 15:06.530
I'll fix it in a jiffy...

15:06.614 --> 15:09.116
[sniffs] ...but I smell
something burning downstairs.

15:09.825 --> 15:12.036
You do?
That's weird, I don't smell anything.

15:12.119 --> 15:13.495
That's the wafting. You better go.

15:13.579 --> 15:14.955
Go, get! Get!

15:18.125 --> 15:19.835
[Jesse]
Oh, Joey, please don't be sad.

15:20.169 --> 15:22.463
Here, I made a scarf out of sausage
for you.

15:24.131 --> 15:27.468
It may not keep you warm but it does
add a pop of color to your outfit.

15:28.886 --> 15:31.764
Sure you don't want to keep 'em
for just you two?

15:32.848 --> 15:33.682
[Danny]
Come on, Joey.

15:34.099 --> 15:36.602
It doesn't matter how or when
you joined this family.

15:36.685 --> 15:39.772
All that matters is
you're an incredibly important part of it.

15:41.732 --> 15:44.777
Joey, you've been a good, loyal friend
for 30 years

15:44.860 --> 15:46.195
and we appreciate you.

15:47.446 --> 15:48.322
Go on.

15:49.448 --> 15:52.326
Joey, it's nothing personal.
I've always loved you.

15:53.118 --> 15:55.037
It's just after losing Pam...

15:55.454 --> 15:58.248
it just felt strange
to have a comic move into the house.

15:58.332 --> 15:59.416
I had young kids.

16:00.000 --> 16:01.460
You had crazy hours.

16:02.920 --> 16:05.297
You know,
we might not get out of here tonight,

16:05.381 --> 16:09.551
and I may not be able to tell you this
at the Thanksgiving table:

16:10.427 --> 16:12.221
how thankful I am

16:12.680 --> 16:15.557
that I get to spend my life
with both of you.

16:17.059 --> 16:18.018
[Joey sniffles]

16:18.102 --> 16:21.814
Dang it. You two made my eyes water
and now they're frozen shut.

16:22.940 --> 16:24.316
Come on, breathe on me.

16:24.900 --> 16:27.152
[Danny and Jesse huffing]

16:30.572 --> 16:32.241
I've awoken from my slumber.

16:33.534 --> 16:35.452
I don't know which handsome prince
to marry.

16:37.663 --> 16:39.790
Guys, we're gonna be okay.

16:40.290 --> 16:41.166
Yeah.

16:42.334 --> 16:43.210
Hey, Jess?

16:44.003 --> 16:45.629
I think your hair turned to ice.

16:46.296 --> 16:48.716
My gel must have froze.
Is it just that one spot?

16:48.799 --> 16:49.967
Let's go with yes.

16:53.429 --> 16:54.722
Without my hair, I'm nothing.

16:55.347 --> 16:56.974
We gotta get out of this place. Move!

16:59.560 --> 17:02.271
The only thing worse than death
is going bald.

17:08.402 --> 17:10.487
I got this, guys. I got this.

17:12.072 --> 17:14.241
-[bell jingles]
-Got it, guys! I got it!

17:15.075 --> 17:16.869
[Joey] This is great. We're free!

17:17.786 --> 17:20.122
-[Joey] All right, way to go.
-[Danny] Let's get out of here.

17:20.205 --> 17:21.373
Yeah, way to go, Jess!

17:21.582 --> 17:22.541
All right!

17:23.959 --> 17:24.793
Guys?

17:25.210 --> 17:27.463
-A little help, huh?
-[Joey] Oh, sorry.

17:27.546 --> 17:29.548
Oh, yeah. Sorry about that.

17:30.924 --> 17:32.176
[vocalizing]

17:33.719 --> 17:35.512
Hey, Deej, I need you!

17:35.721 --> 17:37.264
Don't worry, I'm coming.

17:37.347 --> 17:38.682
I have got you covered.

17:38.766 --> 17:39.892
I knew you would...

17:40.642 --> 17:41.769
pull it off.

17:44.354 --> 17:47.274
Wow. Steph, it's beautiful.

17:47.983 --> 17:50.069
Thanks. It is beautiful, isn't it?

17:50.569 --> 17:52.780
I'm sorry that I ever doubted you.

17:53.197 --> 17:54.531
And that's all I did.

17:54.740 --> 17:56.158
Doubt you, nothing else.

17:58.619 --> 17:59.745
Thanks, Deej.

17:59.828 --> 18:01.622
If the guys would just get here with
my turkey,

18:01.705 --> 18:02.915
everything would be perfect.

18:03.373 --> 18:05.042
Guys, guys, stop fighting!

18:05.125 --> 18:06.668
It's just Thanksgiving dinner!

18:08.629 --> 18:10.005
Once again, nobody is fighting.

18:12.758 --> 18:15.969
Oh, hey, Tommy. You got something
on your face there, buddy.

18:16.053 --> 18:17.513
Cheesy potatoes.

18:20.808 --> 18:22.101
Cheesy potatoes.

18:23.393 --> 18:25.395
I didn't make any cheesy potatoes.

18:26.021 --> 18:28.816
Oh, he probably heard that
in a rap song somewhere.

18:31.944 --> 18:33.737
You made cheesy potatoes, didn't you?

18:34.196 --> 18:35.322
Did you make anything else?

18:35.405 --> 18:37.616
How could you even ask me that?

18:44.957 --> 18:46.708
A green bean casserole?

18:47.251 --> 18:49.002
[low voice]
"DJ didn't make that.

18:49.211 --> 18:51.255
That was my green bean casserole."

18:52.756 --> 18:54.550
That's what you think Cosmo sounds like?

18:54.633 --> 18:57.010
-No, it's more like--
-Kimmy, not now!

18:59.179 --> 19:01.515
Come on, Cosmo. Let's get out of here.

19:01.765 --> 19:04.560
[exaggerated voice]
"Yes, I agree, Kimberlina."

19:09.648 --> 19:10.983
You made a whole meal, didn't you?

19:11.942 --> 19:13.152
Not a whole meal.

19:13.235 --> 19:14.862
I didn't even try a turkey.

19:17.072 --> 19:18.490
What happened to believing in me?

19:18.991 --> 19:20.909
Well, I do believe in you.

19:21.326 --> 19:24.788
It's just those crazy persimmon recipes
I have a problem with.

19:25.497 --> 19:29.376
No, your problem is that you always want
everything your way.

19:30.002 --> 19:31.336
You know,
why don't you go upstairs

19:31.420 --> 19:34.756
to what I'm sure is a tiny Williams-Sonoma
up in the boys' room

19:34.840 --> 19:36.466
and go eat your cheesy potatoes, okay?

19:36.550 --> 19:38.760
'Cause I'm going to go to Uncle Monty's
and get my turkey.

19:39.928 --> 19:41.138
Steph, I'm sorry.

19:41.221 --> 19:42.764
You know, I don't want to hear it, Deej.

19:44.516 --> 19:46.059
Where are your keys?
I need your car.

19:46.727 --> 19:47.561
Dad took them.

19:49.188 --> 19:51.023
Fine, Joey's car it is.

19:55.736 --> 19:56.737
Cheesy potatoes.

19:56.820 --> 19:58.280
Her head is a cheesy potato.

20:04.203 --> 20:06.288
[engine starts]

20:20.928 --> 20:22.179
I'm in the house...

20:22.930 --> 20:24.264
and I'm still in the car.

20:25.057 --> 20:25.933
Again.

20:28.227 --> 20:30.354
Oh, no.

20:47.829 --> 20:48.956
Maybe no one will notice.

21:02.719 --> 21:03.845
Hi, Tommy.

21:04.554 --> 21:06.265
There's a car in the kitchen.

21:10.143 --> 21:11.061
There is?

21:15.148 --> 21:17.109
Oh, my flashback!

21:18.986 --> 21:20.862
Stephanie, are you hurt?

21:20.946 --> 21:22.656
No, no, I'm okay.

21:24.032 --> 21:25.909
I can't believe I did this again.

21:26.410 --> 21:28.453
And I ruined Thanksgiving.

21:28.829 --> 21:30.706
No, no, no, as long as you're okay.

21:32.332 --> 21:35.585
I am until Dad sees his house
and Joey sees his car.

21:37.337 --> 21:39.047
No, this is all my fault.

21:39.256 --> 21:41.675
I should have trusted you
in the first place.

21:41.758 --> 21:44.803
Then you never would have gotten mad
and you never would have driven the car.

21:45.929 --> 21:48.056
So, you'll tell Dad you did this?

21:50.434 --> 21:51.893
Oh, he'll never believe that.

21:54.229 --> 21:56.648
Well,
I'm just glad you're such a control freak

21:56.732 --> 21:58.734
that you made an entire back-up dinner,

I just love you guys,

25:44.167 --> 25:47.671
and getting together every year
is the greatest tradition of all.

25:48.547 --> 25:50.048
Oh, Deej.

25:50.715 --> 25:54.427
I love how much you care
about maintaining our family traditions.

25:54.511 --> 25:55.345
Thank you.

25:55.845 --> 25:58.557
And I promise to leave room
for new ones.

25:58.974 --> 26:02.394
Just as long as one of them
isn't driving through the kitchen.

[Dani crying]

26:09.901 --> 26:12.362
I think somebody's hungry.

26:12.445 --> 26:13.405
[laughs]

26:14.948 --> 26:15.824
Oh.

26:16.533 --> 26:21.204
I think it's time for Danielle's
first piece of solid food.

26:22.122 --> 26:24.124
And I know just what it should be.

26:26.668 --> 26:30.213
Mom's picture perfect pumpkin pie.

26:30.297 --> 26:32.507
You can't feed a baby pumpkin pie.

26:33.425 --> 26:36.052
It's just pumpkin puree,
but she doesn't have to know that.

26:39.264 --> 26:41.391
That's nice, another family tradition.

26:41.683 --> 26:42.851
Lying to babies.

26:45.478 --> 26:47.272
[cooing, chattering]

26:50.900 --> 26:52.861
Happy Thanksgiving, everybody!

26:52.944 --> 26:55.530
Happy Thanksgiving.
