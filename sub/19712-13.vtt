we're talking to someone.

47:14.863 --> 47:17.246
Getting information from them,

47:17.365 --> 47:21.367
and... it is risky for this person.

47:21.453 --> 47:23.753
And I just...

47:23.855 --> 47:25.588
I don't want to be responsible

47:25.690 --> 47:27.373
if something goes sideways.

47:28.154 --> 47:30.543
Would you be responsible, though?

47:30.628 --> 47:33.379
I mean, isn't it that person's
choice to talk to you?

47:33.404 --> 47:35.987
Yes. Technically.

47:36.217 --> 47:40.720
But... sometimes it's
hard for people to say no

47:40.805 --> 47:42.989
to what we offer,

47:43.057 --> 47:47.421
and they don't really know what
it is they're getting into.

47:48.746 --> 47:50.563
It just feels shitty.

I'm tired of feeling shitty.

48:02.544 --> 48:03.576
What?

48:05.430 --> 48:07.880
You're a really good person, Stan.

48:09.359 --> 48:11.659
Thanks.

48:11.684 --> 48:13.730
- I wasn't fishing for...
- I know you weren't.

48:13.755 --> 48:15.771

Not many people care like you do.

been feeling stressed,

48:24.321 --> 48:27.488

happy that you're leaving,

48:27.602 --> 48:29.685
but...

48:29.787 --> 48:31.604
I can't help but think
that your department

48:31.689 --> 48:32.822
