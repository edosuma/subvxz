00:16.840 --> 00:18.956
Dear Lord...

00:19.240 --> 00:24.109
...I know we haven't talked to you
since the 4th of July blowout sale...

00:25.400 --> 00:29.234
...but with three more shopping days
until Christmas...

00:29.760 --> 00:31.955
...we ask you to protect us...

00:32.200 --> 00:36.716
...as we stare into the valley
of the shadow of thighs.

00:40.120 --> 00:42.031
- Amen.
- Amen.

00:46.880 --> 00:49.838
Can let go of my hand now, Griff.

00:50.040 --> 00:51.837
Do I have to?

00:52.920 --> 00:54.319
Sorry.

00:54.520 --> 00:56.033
All right.

00:57.080 --> 00:59.833
Let's unlock and load.

01:03.600 --> 01:07.593
Help me. Easy. Easy. Easy.

01:09.600 --> 01:12.910
Don't take it. No-

01:59.080 --> 02:02.231
I love Christmas.
Keep them coming, kids.

02:02.440 --> 02:04.431
Oh, could you pass down
some butter?

02:04.680 --> 02:06.318
- Mom.
- You're not supposed to eat it.

02:07.680 --> 02:09.271
Oh, honey.

02:13.760 --> 02:16.149
- How was work?
- Oh, swell, Peg.

02:16.360 --> 02:18.590
You wanna give me
a little hand here?

02:24.800 --> 02:27.394
Say, looks like my size.

02:27.600 --> 02:29.352
Where's the other one?

02:29.680 --> 02:31.591
You don't want to know.

02:33.080 --> 02:35.150
God, I hate Christmas.

02:35.360 --> 02:38.909
Then I guess this wouldn't be
the best time to ask about a tree.

02:39.120 --> 02:42.192
Now, why would I want something
that just sits in the living room...

02:42.400 --> 02:44.994
...and takes up electricity?
I have you for that.

02:45.200 --> 02:47.589
Come on, Daddy.
We want a Christmas tree.

02:47.800 --> 02:50.189
Yeah. Yeah, and I'm not letting you
hang ornaments...

02:50.400 --> 02:52.072
...on me again this year either.

02:53.000 --> 02:55.798
Do Bundy traditions mean nothing
to you people?

02:56.000 --> 02:57.991
So you got a little rash
from the tinsel.

02:58.200 --> 03:00.156
You were beautiful, son.

03:06.960 --> 03:08.837
Oh, no.

03:12.720 --> 03:15.280
Merry Christmas, all.
I just made some Christmas cookies.

03:15.520 --> 03:17.954
Hey, now, give me those.

03:23.160 --> 03:25.230
You ate my sleeve.

03:31.400 --> 03:32.799
Button.

03:35.160 --> 03:37.799
Well, I just came by to tell you...

03:38.000 --> 03:40.560
...that this year,
I am finally going to win...

03:40.760 --> 03:42.910
...the neighbourhood
decorating contest.

03:43.120 --> 03:46.317
What, are you gonna stand out front
and be the Little Drummer Boy?

03:49.680 --> 03:52.990
No, Stench Who Stole Christmas.

03:53.800 --> 03:57.395
I have imported a hand-carved
nativity scene from Bavaria.

03:57.640 --> 03:59.551
Cost me 5 grand.

03:59.760 --> 04:02.832
Don't you think that money would be
better spent on a needy family?

04:03.040 --> 04:04.678
You know, like us?

04:05.800 --> 04:08.473
Just 25 cents a day would make
a world of difference...

04:08.680 --> 04:11.035
...in this little boy's life.

04:11.920 --> 04:17.074
Forget it. My holy family is going to
kick every Yuletide ass on the block.

04:19.000 --> 04:21.309
Now, that's some Christmas spirit.

04:21.560 --> 04:24.472
You know, maybe we ought to have
some traditions around here.

04:24.680 --> 04:28.070
- What, Peg, like Christmas dinner?
- Oh, no.

04:28.320 --> 04:30.709
That's been done to death.

04:31.240 --> 04:34.516
<i>You know, I saw a gingerbread house
on Oprah today.</i>

04:34.720 --> 04:36.915
Maybe I ought to make one of those.

04:37.120 --> 04:39.839
Does she know
that would require baking?

04:40.320 --> 04:42.595
Not to mention standing up.

04:42.800 --> 04:44.597
I'll show you guys.

04:44.840 --> 04:49.231
I'm going in this kitchen right now
and I'm gonna start baking.

04:50.640 --> 04:55.156
All right. Now, just tell me which one
of these things is the oven?

04:56.520 --> 04:58.556
Tough day, huh, Griff?

05:01.880 --> 05:05.475
- Griff?
- Well, it's a shame the toes don't fit.

05:07.560 --> 05:10.916
Merry Christmas, jingle boobs.

05:11.360 --> 05:12.873
To stop your whining...

05:13.080 --> 05:14.798
...I've got you some holiday help.

05:15.000 --> 05:19.551
Boys. Al, Griff, meet Hal, Biff.

05:22.760 --> 05:24.990
Do they remind you of anyone?

05:26.280 --> 05:28.794
Hootie and One Blowfish?

05:32.440 --> 05:35.637
Okay, teach them
everything you know.

05:35.840 --> 05:39.515
And when those five minutes are up,
get this place straightened up.

05:40.920 --> 05:42.638
Let's huddle.

05:44.640 --> 05:47.757
Hey, I said huddle, not cuddle.

05:49.680 --> 05:53.593
I'm sorry.
Holidays are a lonely time for me.

05:53.800 --> 05:58.237
All right. Listen, we've got two young,
eager boys hanging around us.

05:58.440 --> 06:01.477
- You know what that makes us?
- Michael Jackson?

06:08.960 --> 06:12.430
No! Management.

06:12.640 --> 06:14.312
And you know
what management does?

06:14.520 --> 06:16.431
Takes long lunches
and leaves early?

06:16.640 --> 06:18.437
Exactly.

06:18.640 --> 06:20.596
We've trained our whole lives
for this.

06:24.400 --> 06:27.949
- Smells good in here.
- Oh, a gingerbread house.

06:28.160 --> 06:30.276
Oh, no, no. That's not for eating.

06:30.480 --> 06:33.278
This is what you call decorative.

06:35.480 --> 06:36.674
Oh, that's great.

06:36.880 --> 06:39.917
The first time you cook something,
and you won't let us eat it.

06:40.120 --> 06:42.509
Hey, Mom, there's a big crack in it.

06:42.760 --> 06:45.957
Well, yeah. That's because
it's our house.

06:46.560 --> 06:48.278
You see that cotton candy?

06:48.480 --> 06:50.675
That's asbestos.

06:51.400 --> 06:53.709
Hey, that's cool. Can I help?

06:53.920 --> 06:57.435
Well, sure. Why don't you separate
these eggs.

07:07.640 --> 07:10.712
Peggy, oh, my God.
Something horrible has happened.

07:10.960 --> 07:13.758
Mary and Joseph
have been kidnapped...

07:13.960 --> 07:16.110
...from our nativity scene.

07:17.040 --> 07:18.553
Have you guys seen anything?

07:18.760 --> 07:21.149
- No, nothing.
- No, I haven't seen anything.

07:21.400 --> 07:25.234
Well, they pinned this note
on the donkey.

07:27.280 --> 07:31.751
Pay us $500,
or it's drapes for the holy family.

07:32.400 --> 07:34.311
It's curtains.

07:36.600 --> 07:38.955
That's what they meant. Curtains.

07:45.360 --> 07:48.352
Well, it sounds like
they mean business.

07:48.560 --> 07:51.916
- Are you gonna pay?
- Well, of course we're gonna pay.

07:52.120 --> 07:55.795
- But first we're gonna call the cops.
- No. No cops!

07:57.960 --> 07:59.518
I mean, you don't wanna risk it.

07:59.720 --> 08:02.029
Kidnappers don't like it
when you call the cops.

08:02.240 --> 08:04.993
I'm sure they forgot to put that
in the note.

08:07.560 --> 08:08.549
Bud, Kelly.

08:08.760 --> 08:11.354
- Yeah?
- What?

08:11.560 --> 08:14.028
Will you help us put these up
around the neighbourhood?

08:18.760 --> 08:20.876
Here are your burgers, sir.

08:21.640 --> 08:23.119
They're still warm.

08:23.320 --> 08:25.072
- Well done.
- Thank you, sir.

08:25.280 --> 08:27.953
I said I wanted them well done.

08:29.280 --> 08:31.794
Damn public school system.

08:32.000 --> 08:34.798
You see, this is exactly why
I don't pay taxes.

08:37.880 --> 08:40.758
So, Bundy,
how are your protégés doing?

08:40.960 --> 08:43.349
Well, they're still slightly inflamed...

08:43.559 --> 08:46.313
...but the new employees
are doing well.

08:49.320 --> 08:52.756
Good. You two are fired.

08:52.960 --> 08:55.679
What? What did we do?

08:55.880 --> 08:58.553
It's what you didn't do.
Will you look at this?

08:58.760 --> 09:01.513
These two kids have done more work
in the last three days...

09:01.720 --> 09:04.075
...than you've done in 25 years.

09:05.040 --> 09:07.759
Well, I pace myself.

09:08.560 --> 09:10.596
- Hal, Biff, you're in charge now.
- Oh, okay.

09:10.800 --> 09:13.268
Fine. You want us out of here?
Fine. Let's go, Griff.

09:13.480 --> 09:16.631
There's gotta be other jobs out there
that pay a lot more than this.

09:32.720 --> 09:35.553
Okay, now, remember,
we don't want them to recognise you.

09:35.760 --> 09:39.389
What, do you think I'm an idiot,
Bud? God.

09:48.760 --> 09:50.193
Hello?

09:50.760 --> 09:55.072
If you ever want to see
Mary and Joseph alive again...

09:55.960 --> 09:57.996
...drop $500...

09:59.520 --> 10:02.114
<i>...outside the ooz at 9:00.</i>

10:03.480 --> 10:06.199
<i>That's the zoo at 6:00, you moron.</i>

10:06.400 --> 10:10.473
<i>That's the zoo at 6:00, you moron.</i>

10:11.560 --> 10:15.473
Okay. We'll do it, but how do we know
you haven't hurt them?

10:15.680 --> 10:17.557
Tell them to put the statues
on the phone.

10:17.760 --> 10:21.116
Good idea. Put the statues on the-
You idiot.

10:23.440 --> 10:25.351
- We're rich, Bud. We're rich!
- What?

10:25.560 --> 10:28.791
This is gonna be
the best Christmas ever.

10:29.160 --> 10:32.516
Oh, I knew you kids
would get the Christmas spirit.

10:32.720 --> 10:35.314
Hi, Mom. I thought you finished
our gingerbread house.

10:35.560 --> 10:36.834
Well, I did.

10:37.040 --> 10:42.319
But I had so much fun that I decided
to bake the whole neighbourhood.

10:48.120 --> 10:50.031
That- This is incredible.

10:50.240 --> 10:52.913
Hey, look. There's old man
Maginty's house.

10:53.120 --> 10:56.749
You even got the telescope he uses
to watch me shower.

10:58.280 --> 11:00.032
Mom, what are those two
marshmallows...

11:00.240 --> 11:02.037
...in your bedroom window?

11:02.240 --> 11:05.391
Oh, well, that's Daddy mooning
the D'Arcys.

11:18.160 --> 11:19.639
Bless you.

11:22.000 --> 11:24.150
You know, I'm tired of looking out
for the cops.

11:24.360 --> 11:27.033
I wanna get down to that mall
employment office. Wanna come?

11:27.240 --> 11:29.231
No, I'm fine.
I've got some money put away.

11:29.440 --> 11:31.635
What kind of job you gonna find
on Christmas Eve?

11:31.840 --> 11:35.833
Whatever kind of job it is, it can't be
any more humiliating than this.

11:46.880 --> 11:49.314
Hey, mister, are you Santa?

11:50.800 --> 11:53.234
Do I look like Santa?

11:53.440 --> 11:55.351
Well, you're fat.

11:57.120 --> 11:59.554
Well, you're walking.

12:07.080 --> 12:09.389
Al, is that you?

12:09.600 --> 12:12.831
Man, you make one ugly hobbit.

12:13.040 --> 12:16.237
I happen to be the elfineer.

12:17.160 --> 12:19.993
- At least I got a job.
- Well, I got a job.

12:20.200 --> 12:21.952
I thought
you had money put away.

12:22.160 --> 12:25.277
Well, I did, but then I got a corn dog
and a kiddie coke...

12:25.480 --> 12:27.277
...and there went my nest egg.

12:29.040 --> 12:30.598
Well, what kind of job you doing?

12:30.800 --> 12:34.554
I got an executive position
in the overnight-delivery business.

12:34.760 --> 12:39.311
Hey, Blitzen, get your tail back over
to the sled.

12:40.120 --> 12:42.270
Hi, I'm Prancer.

12:47.840 --> 12:49.592
No kidding.

12:50.160 --> 12:53.914
Come on, Blitzen.
It's time to get into our harness.

12:57.480 --> 13:01.996
What kind of reindeer games
you playing over there, Griff?

13:02.800 --> 13:07.078
One more crack out of you
and I'll kick your curly-toed butt.

13:07.280 --> 13:10.750
Well, now, Griff, don't be bitter just
because my job's better than yours.

13:12.760 --> 13:14.113
Mister...

13:14.320 --> 13:17.073
...I don't feel so good.

13:17.280 --> 13:21.432
Son, son, I'm an elf, not a doctor.

13:25.520 --> 13:26.873
This is all your fault.

13:27.080 --> 13:30.038
What were you doing sticking
the statues out the car window?

13:31.280 --> 13:34.511
Well, what were you doing
driving through a tunnel?

13:35.520 --> 13:37.397
I don't know what
the big deal is, Bud.

13:37.600 --> 13:39.238
You don't know what the big deal is?

13:39.440 --> 13:42.113
We beheaded Mary and Joseph.

13:42.720 --> 13:45.553
We're going to jail.
We're going to hell.

13:48.280 --> 13:50.840
Now, this is what
we're gonna do, see?

13:52.480 --> 13:55.153
Now, we're sticking
to our story, see?

13:55.640 --> 13:58.871
We don't know nothing
about no holy family, see?

14:00.040 --> 14:02.349
Well, we'll do time.

14:02.560 --> 14:05.711
No one's sending me up the river
on no nativity rap.

14:06.000 --> 14:07.752
See?

14:08.200 --> 14:10.395
Oh, my God.

14:11.520 --> 14:13.112
Now, keep your yapper shut.

14:14.960 --> 14:17.315
We waited for over an hour
in the snow...

14:17.520 --> 14:19.351
...and those creeps didn't show.

14:19.560 --> 14:22.552
It's- It's just a contest.
You still have Christmas.

14:22.760 --> 14:25.752
To hell with Christmas. I wanna win.

14:26.360 --> 14:27.509
You see this money?

14:27.720 --> 14:30.393
This is the closest those kidnappers
are gonna to get to it.

14:30.600 --> 14:35.071
I'm gonna hunt that scum down
if it takes every last cent she has.

14:36.440 --> 14:39.000
I'm sure they're very, very sorry.

14:39.200 --> 14:40.952
No.

14:42.640 --> 14:45.074
They'll be sorry, all right.

14:45.280 --> 14:50.274
Because when we find them,
I'll tear out their fingernails.

14:50.960 --> 14:53.520
Rip their guts out.

14:54.160 --> 14:56.720
And skin them alive.

14:57.960 --> 15:00.269
We did it.

15:01.200 --> 15:02.872
It was us.

15:03.080 --> 15:04.957
It was her!

15:05.440 --> 15:08.318
You're not pinning this one
on me, rat boy.

15:09.400 --> 15:12.392
You stole our statues?

15:12.600 --> 15:15.512
Hey, now, now, now,
calm down, sister.

15:15.720 --> 15:19.269
- We still got your lousy statues.
- Good.

15:19.480 --> 15:22.870
Because if so much as one hair
is missing from their heads-

15:23.840 --> 15:26.434
They don't have any heads.

15:28.320 --> 15:30.834
I can't believe these don't come
in a lower heel.

15:31.040 --> 15:34.271
Oh, they will. Just stand up on them.

15:45.120 --> 15:50.274
Hey, look. It's Santa's village idiot.
What are you doing here?

15:50.640 --> 15:53.837
I have to use the bathroom, punk.

15:54.040 --> 15:57.396
Don't they have one on the train?

15:58.200 --> 16:00.634
Oh, sure. You guys think you're funny,
don't you?

16:00.840 --> 16:03.752
Well, let me tell you something.
You're looking at your futures.

16:03.960 --> 16:06.110
I don't think so, elf boy.

16:06.320 --> 16:09.153
- This is just a-
- Temporary job.

16:09.360 --> 16:13.319
- Yeah, because we're gonna go to-
- College.

16:13.600 --> 16:16.717
You got a girlfriend?
I'll bet it's a redhead.

16:16.920 --> 16:18.990
How did you know that?

16:19.920 --> 16:21.797
Lucky guess.

16:22.000 --> 16:24.560
Congratulations, boys,
you've peaked.

16:24.760 --> 16:29.436
You're gonna slave away here
day in, day out, year in, year out.

16:29.640 --> 16:32.518
Until one day you'll be close to 50...

16:32.720 --> 16:36.508
...and you'll be an elf
driving a choo-choo.

16:43.560 --> 16:45.232
Oh, my God. What if he's right?

16:45.440 --> 16:47.795
- We gotta get out of here.
- Come on.

16:48.320 --> 16:49.548
What?

16:49.760 --> 16:50.749
- We quit, lady.
- We quit, lady.

16:50.960 --> 16:53.030
What? Wait!

16:53.240 --> 16:55.674
Ladies, please, please.

16:56.160 --> 16:58.754
- Bundy, I gotta talk to you.
- What? You want to rub it in?

16:58.960 --> 17:02.316
Well, that's fine, because firing me
was the best thing you could've done.

17:02.520 --> 17:07.674
Because I have a better job now, with
more responsibility and a big hat too.

17:08.240 --> 17:10.674
So you can take your shoe-store job
and shove it...

17:10.880 --> 17:13.916
<i>...because I have something
that's even more important:</i>

17:14.119 --> 17:16.680
My self-respect.

17:21.400 --> 17:24.550
- You can have your job back.
- Thank you.

17:26.400 --> 17:29.710
Excuse me.
We've all been waiting forever.

17:29.920 --> 17:34.152
- But first, a few demands.
- Anything. Just get back to work.

17:34.360 --> 17:36.635
All right. I want you to give
Griff his job back.

17:36.840 --> 17:39.513
Although he's a proud man,
he may not take it.

17:39.720 --> 17:41.870
I'll take it.

17:51.360 --> 17:54.716
- What else, more money?
- Hey, I'm making the demands here.

17:55.760 --> 17:57.751
I also want...

17:58.000 --> 17:59.638
...more money.

18:00.240 --> 18:02.470
And that tree.

18:04.480 --> 18:05.754
No more money.

18:05.960 --> 18:07.871
You can have the tree
after Christmas.

18:08.080 --> 18:09.638
No, no!

18:09.840 --> 18:12.035
Before Christmas.

18:12.240 --> 18:14.993
I'm going to put my foot down.

18:18.520 --> 18:22.229
You drive a hard bargain for a Smurf.

18:23.040 --> 18:25.156
He's an elf.

18:25.360 --> 18:28.113
That's ex-elf.

18:33.600 --> 18:35.591
Damn, it's cold.

18:40.800 --> 18:43.997
I'm freezing my frankincense off.

18:44.200 --> 18:47.112
This is all your fault, "mistletoad. "

18:47.320 --> 18:50.949
- Mom, please make her let us go.
- No.

18:51.160 --> 18:53.037
What you did was wrong.

18:53.240 --> 18:57.711
You had no intention of sharing
that ransom money with me.

18:58.880 --> 19:02.077
- Here come the judges.
- Merry Christmas, D'Arcys.

19:02.280 --> 19:05.431
I see you've outspent yourselves
as usual.

19:05.640 --> 19:08.598
It is a beautiful display, though.

19:08.800 --> 19:11.109
So lifelike.

19:12.120 --> 19:17.319
Yes, but Mary looks a bit trampy.

19:19.600 --> 19:23.309
Well, I hate to say it,
but I think we may have a winner.

19:23.520 --> 19:25.988
Yes, I won. I won!

19:26.240 --> 19:29.516
Oh, I bought the spirit of Christmas.

19:29.800 --> 19:32.314
I think she means she brought
the spirit of Christmas.

19:32.520 --> 19:34.670
Oh, yes, to you lovely people.

19:34.880 --> 19:36.313
Wait a minute.

19:36.520 --> 19:39.034
Look at the Bundys' window.

19:39.240 --> 19:41.800
Is that our neighbourhood?

19:42.000 --> 19:45.470
I made it myself out of gingerbread.

19:45.680 --> 19:50.310
Look, Marge, isn't that your father
with his telescope?

19:53.440 --> 19:56.989
Congratulations, Mrs. Bundy.
Here's your trophy.

19:57.200 --> 20:00.158
And a hundred dollars.

20:04.040 --> 20:05.473
Well, thanks.

20:05.680 --> 20:10.879
You know, I haven't won anything
since I was Miss Teenage Wanker.

20:12.240 --> 20:16.552
And you get second prize,
a fruitcake.

20:19.880 --> 20:22.633
Shove the fruitcake, you bitch.

20:25.920 --> 20:27.876
We'll take it.

20:29.280 --> 20:32.192
Yeah, we love fruitcake.

20:44.160 --> 20:45.912
<i>This special report just in.</i>

20:46.120 --> 20:48.714
<i>Hundreds of people are flocking
to the Dan Ryan tunnel...</i>

20:48.920 --> 20:50.319
<i>...to see a Christmas miracle.</i>

20:50.520 --> 20:53.592
<i>Witnesses are saying that the heads
of Joseph and the Virgin Mary...</i>

20:53.800 --> 20:56.917
<i>...appear to be embedded
in the tunnel wall.</i>

21:01.120 --> 21:03.793
Merry Christmas.

21:06.760 --> 21:10.389
Oh, Al, you got a tree.

21:10.600 --> 21:13.592
Oh, Daddy, and before Christmas.

21:13.800 --> 21:16.553
- Oh, honey, how was your day?
- Oh, same old thing, Peg.

21:16.760 --> 21:20.230
Started out in the shoe store,
you know, ended up in the shoe store.

21:20.440 --> 21:22.431
You know, this is the best
Christmas ever.

21:22.640 --> 21:26.838
We got a tree and I won
the neighbourhood decorating contest.

21:27.040 --> 21:29.998
And I- I still have nine toes.

21:30.240 --> 21:31.798
Eight.

21:33.000 --> 21:35.434
Merry Christmas.
