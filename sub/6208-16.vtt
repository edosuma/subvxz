WEBVTT

00:04.120 --> 00:06.190
All done. Dinner was delicious.

00:06.190 --> 00:08.660
I don't believe you finished off your lima beans.

00:08.760 --> 00:10.770
I'm an adult and most of mine are in my napkin.

00:10.770 --> 00:12.770
What can I say? I love lima beans.

00:12.770 --> 00:15.970
Are you sure you didn't make them magically disappear?

00:15.970 --> 00:18.610
Aunt Zelda! I'm offended you would even ask me that question.

00:18.610 --> 00:20.610
Now if you'll excuse me, I'll clear.

00:22.810 --> 00:24.870
A kid who likes lima beans?

00:25.100 --> 00:27.320
Being a witch is just the tip of her weirdness.

00:27.320 --> 00:30.820
There's still something fishy. Did you notice how she dodged my question?

00:30.820 --> 00:32.820
Oh come on. Sabrina's not that cagey.

00:32.820 --> 00:34.510
There's only one way to find out.

00:34.510 --> 00:37.820
Remember that spell mom used to cast to make sure we'd eaten all out vegetables?

00:37.820 --> 00:39.350
Oh I hated that spell!

00:39.350 --> 00:40.260
Hated what spell?

00:40.260 --> 00:41.070
This.

00:41.570 --> 00:42.860
What's that all about?

00:42.860 --> 00:46.060
A spell to bring back any lima beans you may have made disappear.

00:46.060 --> 00:48.060
What! Get down!

00:52.010 --> 00:53.960
I told you I hated that spell.

01:00.030 --> 01:02.100
1x16. Mars Attracts

01:18.020 --> 01:20.100
Ha! There.

01:20.100 --> 01:21.430
What am I looking for again?

01:21.500 --> 01:24.710
The Olympus Mons. It's the largest mountain in the solar-system.

01:24.710 --> 01:26.250
I see a little bump.

01:26.250 --> 01:27.760
Now can we spy on the neighbours?

01:27.760 --> 01:28.540
No!

01:28.540 --> 01:32.160
Now that little bump happens to be the best skiing on Mars,

01:32.160 --> 01:34.500
and that's where we're going for our winter vacation.

01:34.500 --> 01:35.550
We're going to Mars?

01:35.550 --> 01:37.000
It's a trek, but it's worth it

01:37.000 --> 01:38.840
Oh you'll love the red planet.

01:38.840 --> 01:40.500
It's so pretty and the sky's pink.

01:40.500 --> 01:41.930
So what are the Martians like?

01:41.930 --> 01:42.990
Martians?

01:42.990 --> 01:43.930
Aren't there Martians?

01:43.930 --> 01:46.670
No. Jeez Sabrina, get in touch with reality.

01:47.140 --> 01:52.140
So Louis the fourteenth was succeeded by another Louis who was known as...?

01:52.140 --> 01:53.320
Any guesses?

01:54.000 --> 01:57.180
Okay. I see winter break has already started.

01:57.180 --> 02:01.020
Well I can't let you go before the bell, so just try to keep it quiet.

02:01.020 --> 02:02.010
Hey Sabrina.

02:02.010 --> 02:03.560
Louis the fifteenth.

02:03.950 --> 02:06.570
No. What are you doing over vacation?

02:06.570 --> 02:08.570
Oh, I'm going skiing with my aunts.

02:08.570 --> 02:09.729
Out West?

02:09.729 --> 02:10.699
Actually...

02:10.699 --> 02:12.700
...North. How about you?

02:12.700 --> 02:13.930
I'll be here.

02:13.930 --> 02:17.130
In fact I was hoping you'd be here too so maybe we could do stuff.

02:17.200 --> 02:19.940
Really? I wish I had known. I love doing stuff.

02:20.310 --> 02:22.630
This trips not gonna be any fun. I mean...

02:22.630 --> 02:24.190
I don't even know how to ski.

02:24.190 --> 02:25.670
You could take lessons.

02:25.670 --> 02:28.490
Oh great! So I get to study on my vacation.

02:28.490 --> 02:30.500
Come on, you'll have a blast,

02:30.500 --> 02:31.870
and I'll see you in...

02:32.130 --> 02:33.250
five days?

02:33.340 --> 02:34.320
Six.

02:34.320 --> 02:36.320
Man, six days.

02:37.130 --> 02:39.710
Well I'd better go catch my bus.

02:40.060 --> 02:41.520
I guess this is it.

02:41.520 --> 02:42.760
See ya.

02:50.260 --> 02:51.570
Wow!

02:53.530 --> 02:56.270
I just don't understand why other kids get to stay home...

02:56.270 --> 02:57.750
and I have to go on a ski vacation?

02:57.750 --> 02:59.860
You were so excited about it last night?

02:59.860 --> 03:01.790
Yeah, well a lots changed since then.

03:01.790 --> 03:04.230
I mean just today Harvey asked me if I wanted to do stuff.

03:04.230 --> 03:07.040
Well there'll be plenty of stuff left to do when we get back.

03:07.040 --> 03:09.190
Why don't you guys go and I'll stay home with Salem?

03:09.290 --> 03:12.450
Hey, the whole point of a family vacation is...

03:12.450 --> 03:14.750
so I can get a vacation from the family.

03:14.750 --> 03:16.600
Please, I need some down time.

03:16.600 --> 03:19.800
Well that's the end of the discussion. You're going and that's that.

03:20.080 --> 03:23.020
Fine. I'll go to Mars but I won't have any fun.

03:23.720 --> 03:27.080
Do what you want but I think you're over reacting.

03:27.080 --> 03:30.580
I mean it's not like you're never going to see Harvey ever again.

03:32.080 --> 03:33.750
Huh! Here he is now!

03:33.850 --> 03:36.310
Don't you love when things like that happen in real life?

03:37.140 --> 03:38.310
Hey! Hi.

03:38.760 --> 03:40.810
I hope it's okay I stopped by.

03:40.810 --> 03:43.170
Sure! Your timings perfect.

03:43.170 --> 03:44.870
My aunts were just about to...

03:44.870 --> 03:45.060
take naps.
My aunts were just about to...

03:45.060 --> 03:45.810
take naps.

03:45.810 --> 03:47.880
Oh. Right

03:49.310 --> 03:50.580
So tired.

03:50.580 --> 03:52.880
Oh I hope I can make it up the stairs.

03:54.150 --> 03:55.690
Come on in.

03:55.690 --> 03:57.690
So what's up?

03:58.130 --> 04:00.220
I'm not gonna waste your time with small talk.

04:00.220 --> 04:04.020
You're going skiing and you can't afford to lose your mittens so I got you these.

04:04.200 --> 04:05.870
They're called Mitten Minders.

04:05.870 --> 04:07.390
You string them through your jacket.

04:07.390 --> 04:09.390
My little brother swears by 'em.

04:09.390 --> 04:11.270
That's so thoughtful...

04:11.270 --> 04:13.450
and stretchy. Thanks.

04:14.100 --> 04:16.120
Anyway. I'm got to get the car back to my mom.

04:16.120 --> 04:18.420
Hey. Maybe I could call you from the lodge.

04:18.420 --> 04:20.519
Let you know how the mitten minders are working.

04:20.519 --> 04:22.360
Really? I'd like that.

04:22.360 --> 04:23.650
I'd like that a lot.

04:23.650 --> 04:25.000
Well when should I call?

04:25.000 --> 04:26.530
Tonight... around nine?

04:26.530 --> 04:28.670
Okay.

04:28.900 --> 04:32.340
Ah creak! Oh these old homes are so creaky.

04:32.340 --> 04:34.340
Well you'd better get going.

04:34.340 --> 04:36.340
Yeah. Er have a great trip.

04:36.510 --> 04:38.340
Thanks again.

04:38.360 --> 04:39.430
You're welcome.

04:40.060 --> 04:41.430
Bye.

04:45.030 --> 04:46.000
See ya.

04:53.160 --> 04:55.800
Sorry! I got caught up in the moment.

04:56.290 --> 04:57.800
Come on Sabrina!

04:57.950 --> 04:59.680
Mars is waiting!

05:02.260 --> 05:04.210
Is that all you're bringing?

05:04.210 --> 05:05.660
We've got these.

05:06.130 --> 05:09.630
Now Salem, you have the number of the lodge in case you need to reach us.

05:09.630 --> 05:11.170
And we left you plenty of food.

05:11.170 --> 05:12.570
Don't eat it all on one day.

05:12.570 --> 05:16.370
Oh right, I forgot I'm an animal. I have no self control.

05:16.370 --> 05:18.370
And no parties while we're gone.

05:18.370 --> 05:20.370
I'll cancel the black and white ball.

05:20.370 --> 05:22.370
Well, then I guess we're off.

05:24.040 --> 05:26.280
Bye! Have fun!

05:26.960 --> 05:28.280
Miss you!

05:30.620 --> 05:33.730
A party! Why didn't I think of that?

05:36.330 --> 05:39.270
Watch your step. These stairs are a little icy.

05:39.530 --> 05:41.670
The whole lodge is a little icy.

05:41.670 --> 05:43.670
Isn't it beautiful?

05:43.970 --> 05:45.870
And it's the perfect time of year.

05:45.870 --> 05:48.260
At the end of the season the rooms get a little slushy.

05:48.530 --> 05:49.700
What's that?

05:49.700 --> 05:50.970
A volcano.

05:50.970 --> 05:52.970
Wow! There she blows.

05:52.970 --> 05:55.980
I'll just get an energy bar and then I think I'll hit the slopes.

05:55.980 --> 05:57.980
I think I'll hit the couch.

05:57.980 --> 05:59.500
Aren't you going skiing?

05:59.500 --> 06:01.860
Oh. I don't ski, I lodge.

06:01.860 --> 06:03.860
All I need is a stack of magazines.

06:04.550 --> 06:06.110
And some catalogues.

06:06.680 --> 06:09.710
And Tolstoy's classic 'War and Peace'

06:11.370 --> 06:13.360
I think I'll read that last.

06:13.460 --> 06:16.360
So when does the family part of this family vacation begin?

06:16.360 --> 06:18.220
We'll all meet for dinner.

06:18.220 --> 06:19.710
Well what am I supposed to do until then?

06:19.710 --> 06:22.010
Well we thought you'd wanna hang out with people your age.

06:22.010 --> 06:24.040
All the people my age are on another planet.

06:24.040 --> 06:25.420
I'm calling Harvey.

06:25.470 --> 06:26.740
Oh you can't.

06:26.740 --> 06:30.540
Mars is in a time zone that's so far ahead of earth it's still yesterday there.

06:30.540 --> 06:32.840
If you call Harvey, he'll explode.

06:32.840 --> 06:35.440
This stinks. I'm going to my room.

06:38.080 --> 06:41.410
She'll find the Tobleron in the mini-bar and be fine.

06:41.410 --> 06:42.980
Well, enjoy your day.

06:42.980 --> 06:44.490
Enjoy yours.

07:01.170 --> 07:02.930
Ah I love this planet!

07:05.770 --> 07:07.780
Oh! What a day.

07:07.890 --> 07:10.990
I'm exhausted. Read me 'War and Peace'

07:11.850 --> 07:14.040
Morning.

07:14.040 --> 07:15.470
Are you going skiing again?

07:15.470 --> 07:17.470
Yes. Are you reading magazines again?

07:17.470 --> 07:19.470
Not today. I thought I'd take it easy.

07:19.470 --> 07:21.070
Morning.

07:21.070 --> 07:22.190
Did you sleep alright?

07:22.190 --> 07:25.140
I slept fine. The only problem was I woke up here.

07:25.140 --> 07:26.850
Cheer up.

07:26.850 --> 07:29.100
I promise today will be more fun.

07:29.100 --> 07:30.500
I'm going to get you a ski lesson.

07:30.500 --> 07:32.200
Don't bother. My days mapped out.

07:32.200 --> 07:34.440
I'm going to analyse you guys in my journal until nine

07:34.440 --> 07:37.040
and then I'm calling Harvey. I'll be by the phones.

07:37.480 --> 07:40.660
There's no sign of the policy holder yet.

07:40.660 --> 07:45.360
But I will not rest until said policy holder has been found. Now I plan...

07:45.360 --> 07:47.350
I can't talk. There's somebody here.

07:47.350 --> 07:50.150
Erm. Okay! Goodbye! I love you!

07:50.150 --> 07:52.430
No. I just said that to throw them off.

07:52.430 --> 07:53.790
Yeah. You hang up.

07:55.480 --> 07:57.720
Okay. It's all yours.

07:57.720 --> 08:00.620
Thanks. But I wont be using it for another twelve hours.

08:00.930 --> 08:03.220
Really? How very interesting.

08:05.510 --> 08:07.630
February fifth... Again.

08:08.120 --> 08:09.630
Are you Sabrina?

08:09.740 --> 08:12.650
Yeah, but I'm kinda busy. So if you wouldn't mind waiting till I'm fin...

08:13.590 --> 08:15.710
...ished. Period. Done! What did you want?

08:15.800 --> 08:16.610
My names Doug.

08:16.610 --> 08:19.140
Um your aunt Zelda just arranged for me to give you a ski lesson.

08:19.140 --> 08:20.710
But she said you might not be up for it.

08:20.710 --> 08:22.660
I don't know where she got that idea. I mean...

08:22.660 --> 08:24.330
when in Mars.

08:24.330 --> 08:26.330
I will be back in twelve hours wont I?

08:26.330 --> 08:28.330
Unless you're really uncoordinated.

08:28.330 --> 08:29.930
Well then, let's go.

08:31.410 --> 08:32.919
Excuse me.

08:32.919 --> 08:34.480
Do you mind if I sit over there?

08:34.480 --> 08:36.100
Sure. It's a free planet.

08:36.100 --> 08:36.780
Thank you.

08:41.600 --> 08:44.290
I couldn't help but notice you from across the room there.

08:44.290 --> 08:48.210
My name is Warren and I'm a very successful insurance salesman

08:48.210 --> 08:51.110
and I am on an expense account you would not believe.

08:51.110 --> 08:54.110
Oh please! You lodge lizards are all alike.

08:55.150 --> 08:57.160
Look, we can chat

08:57.160 --> 09:00.960
but not if you spend the next four days making up stories just to impress me.

09:00.960 --> 09:01.740
-Oh well I would never make a...

09:01.740 --> 09:02.490
-Let's make a pact.
-Oh well I would never make a...

09:02.490 --> 09:02.760
-Let's make a pact.

09:02.760 --> 09:07.570
For once, two strangers meeting on vacation will be completely honest with each other.

09:07.570 --> 09:08.640
Okay?

09:08.640 --> 09:10.240
Okay, you got it.

09:10.240 --> 09:10.980
Great.

09:10.980 --> 09:12.370
I'm a secret agent.

09:12.370 --> 09:13.440
What?

09:13.440 --> 09:15.830
I'm here to sniff out a counter operative.

09:15.830 --> 09:17.110
You're not it are you?

09:17.110 --> 09:18.260
No.

09:18.260 --> 09:20.260
Good, I'd hate to have to kill you.

09:22.810 --> 09:23.490
So...

09:24.170 --> 09:25.490
are you married?

09:27.330 --> 09:29.360
What do I do? I've never skied before.

09:29.360 --> 09:30.690
Ah you'll be great.

09:32.090 --> 09:33.890
All set. You can ski.

09:33.890 --> 09:34.830
Just like that?

09:34.830 --> 09:36.860
It's a short lesson but pretty expensive.

09:37.320 --> 09:38.860
Let's go. Follow me.

09:42.510 --> 09:45.190
Hey, wait up! You're going too fast. I'm new at this.

09:45.930 --> 09:47.820
How do I stop again?

09:48.270 --> 09:49.820
How are you doing back there?

09:49.820 --> 09:51.350
I'm doing fine.

09:54.750 --> 09:56.430
So let me get this straight.

09:56.430 --> 09:59.630
Your mission is to bring down Doctor Cyclops,

09:59.630 --> 10:04.630
who through his ring of operatives is trying to destabilise the Balinese government.

10:04.630 --> 10:08.130
Yeah. Plus there's some unbelievable stuff that I just can't tell you about.

10:08.300 --> 10:11.060
So what kind of doctor is Doctor Cyclops?

10:11.060 --> 10:12.240
A psychiatrist?

10:12.240 --> 10:13.230
No.

10:13.230 --> 10:14.790
He's not really a doctor.

10:14.790 --> 10:18.990
I mean, he may have a Ph.D., but Doctor Cyclops is just his code-name.

10:18.990 --> 10:20.240
And he hates it.

10:20.990 --> 10:23.490
Where are all your clever spy gadgets?

10:23.490 --> 10:26.290
Well, check out this baby.

10:27.280 --> 10:28.660
A tooth-pick!

10:28.660 --> 10:30.400
A poisoned tooth-pick.

10:30.400 --> 10:33.900
Perfect! Especially if Doctor Cyclops just had corn-on-the-cob.

10:33.900 --> 10:35.900
Hi aunt Hilda.

10:35.900 --> 10:39.100
Sabrina, finally! I thought you were just going skiing for a couple of hours.

10:39.100 --> 10:41.100
I thought so too, but it turns out I'm a natural.

10:41.100 --> 10:42.170
Hey do you want some hot chocolate?

10:42.170 --> 10:43.080
Please.

10:43.080 --> 10:45.350
Oh great. You're just in time for our family dinner.

10:45.350 --> 10:48.250
Actually Doug and I just wanted to collapse in front of the volcano.

10:48.250 --> 10:50.850
Then Zelda and I will have a family dinner.

10:50.960 --> 10:54.070
Actually we just saw her on the slopes. I think she's might be night skiing.

10:54.070 --> 10:57.570
Great! Then I'll just have a family dinner all by myself.

10:57.570 --> 11:00.770
Ah. You know I-I realise I'm not family...

11:01.190 --> 11:02.160
Yet,

11:02.470 --> 11:04.740
er but I'd be happy to chow down with you.

11:04.740 --> 11:06.740
Would you let me try your entrÃ©e?

11:06.740 --> 11:07.420
Sure.

11:07.420 --> 11:08.390
Okay.

11:09.740 --> 11:11.140
There you go.

11:11.140 --> 11:12.610
Do you take marsh-mallows?

11:12.610 --> 11:14.190
The little ones.

11:16.570 --> 11:17.560
There you go.

11:17.560 --> 11:18.730
This is nice.

11:19.410 --> 11:20.630
Whoa! Toastie!

11:20.630 --> 11:22.630
Hey, do you want to play cribbage?

11:22.630 --> 11:24.630
I'd love to. How does it work?

11:24.630 --> 11:26.130
You don't know?

11:27.320 --> 11:28.660
Now you do.

11:28.660 --> 11:31.560
Great. Deal me six and we'll play till I skunk you.

11:31.560 --> 11:32.620
That could take awhile.

11:32.620 --> 11:34.040
I've got time.

11:42.540 --> 11:44.960
I don't believe this. You have a talking dog?

11:44.960 --> 11:46.270
I have a talking cat.

11:46.270 --> 11:48.870
Really? Don't pets make the best of friends?

11:48.870 --> 11:51.760
I mean you get total loyalty, unconditional love...

11:51.760 --> 11:53.170
You've never had a cat have you?

11:56.110 --> 11:57.450
What's going on?

11:57.450 --> 12:00.950
Oh they turn the lodge into a cheesy disco at night. Do you wanna dance?

12:00.950 --> 12:02.050
Sure.

12:02.050 --> 12:03.200
Alright!

12:41.630 --> 12:44.360
Hey! Someone has to make a science diet run!

12:44.580 --> 12:47.560
Wait. Did I just hear the phone?

12:49.160 --> 12:50.640
Yello?

12:50.640 --> 12:52.670
Hi. This is Harvey.

12:52.830 --> 12:55.780
I know Sabrina's not home but I thought maybe you could get a message to her.

12:55.780 --> 12:57.750
Keep it short. Erm,

12:57.750 --> 12:59.560
I don't have anything to write with.

12:59.560 --> 13:01.020
The message is that...

13:01.170 --> 13:04.790
I'm going to sleep now and maybe I'll talk to her tomorrow.

13:04.790 --> 13:05.840
Got it.

13:05.840 --> 13:06.930
Thanks.

13:30.240 --> 13:31.710
Morning ski-bunny.

13:31.710 --> 13:33.550
I ache all over.

13:33.550 --> 13:35.870
Skiing is easy but disco is hard.

13:35.870 --> 13:38.200
You have a message at the front desk to call Salem.

13:38.480 --> 13:40.200
I wonder what he wants.

13:42.850 --> 13:43.920
Hello?

13:43.920 --> 13:44.660
Did I wake you?

13:44.660 --> 13:46.960
No you didn't wake me. I was just...

13:47.240 --> 13:48.380
reading.

13:48.380 --> 13:49.310
You were looking for me?

13:49.310 --> 13:52.600
Yeah. Harvey called last night and asked me to tell ya...

13:52.600 --> 13:53.690
he was going to sleep.

13:53.690 --> 13:55.810
Weird! I wonder wha...

13:56.460 --> 13:59.870
Oh my God. I totally forgot! I gotta go.

14:00.100 --> 14:01.870
You're welcome!

14:02.790 --> 14:05.020
I'm such a jerk.

14:05.880 --> 14:07.010
Hello?

14:07.010 --> 14:08.500
Hey, Sabrina.

14:08.500 --> 14:10.920
I am so sorry I didn't call last night.

14:10.920 --> 14:12.920
I-I must be on Mars or something.

14:12.920 --> 14:14.980
Hey, don't worry. I wasn't like...

14:14.980 --> 14:16.380
waiting by the phone.

14:16.380 --> 14:18.380
So, did you lose you're mittens?

14:18.380 --> 14:21.880
No. Thanks to the mitten-minders my mittens were minded.

14:21.880 --> 14:24.600
Hey Sabrina. Oh you're on the phone.

14:24.600 --> 14:25.980
Yeah, I'll be off in a sec'

14:26.160 --> 14:26.790
Okay.

14:26.960 --> 14:28.080
Who was that?

14:28.080 --> 14:29.360
My ski instructor.

14:29.360 --> 14:31.370
Oh cool! You took lessons.

14:31.370 --> 14:32.520
Do you like your teacher?

14:32.520 --> 14:34.520
Yeah he's... fine.

14:34.520 --> 14:36.350
Well it sounds like you're having fun.

14:36.600 --> 14:39.600
Hey I got all new socks and two new shirts yesterday.

14:39.600 --> 14:41.530
That's great. I can't wait to see them...

14:41.810 --> 14:43.530
Okay. Bye.

14:44.480 --> 14:46.610
AUNT ZELDA!!

14:49.140 --> 14:49.860
Aunt Zelda!

14:49.970 --> 14:51.560
What a pleasant surprise.

14:51.560 --> 14:52.290
Surprise?

14:52.290 --> 14:55.060
I've been skiing behind you for the past five miles screaming your name.

14:55.060 --> 14:56.360
What's going on?

14:56.360 --> 14:58.830
I have a very very serious problem.

14:59.590 --> 15:02.300
Doug asked me to go on a picnic with him tonight.

15:02.300 --> 15:04.250
Well! Seriously,

15:04.250 --> 15:05.740
that sounds like fun.

15:05.740 --> 15:07.740
But I'm not supposed to be having fun.

15:07.740 --> 15:08.650
Why not?

15:08.650 --> 15:12.760
Because I promised myself I wouldn't and then I met Doug and now I'm all confused.

15:12.760 --> 15:14.760
I mean how can I like Doug when I like Harvey?

15:14.760 --> 15:16.830
Sabrina, you're very young

15:16.830 --> 15:21.230
and odds are over the next ten years you will meet and like many different boys.

15:21.410 --> 15:24.770
Thank you for that sweeping generality but what do I do about tonight?

15:24.770 --> 15:26.180
Do you wanna go?

15:26.180 --> 15:28.770
Yeah, but I'm worried it would hurt Harvey's feelings.

15:28.900 --> 15:33.170
Well then you have weigh your desire to go versus your desire not to hurt Harvey.

15:33.450 --> 15:35.930
Or I could go and Harvey'll never find out?

15:35.930 --> 15:40.040
Bad idea. Relationships are hard enough when you're completely honest.

15:40.040 --> 15:42.540
You start hiding things, you're taking a risk,

15:42.540 --> 15:44.500
but it's your choice.

15:44.500 --> 15:46.500
I can't make the decision for you.

15:46.500 --> 15:48.500
Are you sure? It would really help me out.

15:50.780 --> 15:52.240
Oh, you're back.

15:52.240 --> 15:54.580
I made it all the way down Olympus Mons.

15:54.580 --> 15:56.070
It was spectacular!

15:56.070 --> 15:58.970
Ugh! You should have used more sun-block.

15:58.970 --> 16:02.470
Enemy transmissions are definitely coming from someplace in the...

16:03.830 --> 16:05.220
Hey! Ooh! Who's she?

16:05.220 --> 16:06.000
My sister.

16:06.000 --> 16:06.940
Who are you?

16:06.940 --> 16:08.180
Warren. He's a...

16:08.180 --> 16:09.380
Insurance salesman.

16:09.510 --> 16:10.730
Are you covered?

16:11.120 --> 16:12.370
Ha-ha! I'm just kidding.

16:12.450 --> 16:14.020
Okay let's go to the family dinner.

16:14.020 --> 16:16.320
Shouldn't we wait for Sabrina?

16:16.320 --> 16:17.560
She went off with Doug.

16:17.560 --> 16:18.760
Who's Doug?

16:18.760 --> 16:20.030
Her ski instructor.

16:20.030 --> 16:22.030
Oh I hope she made the right decision.

16:23.500 --> 16:24.620
Here we are.

16:25.620 --> 16:27.600
Wow! Picnic in a crater.

16:27.600 --> 16:31.160
Oh it's not just a crater. It's the best crater on the planet.

16:31.470 --> 16:32.750
Mars is so cool.

16:32.750 --> 16:34.520
You're lucky you get to live here all the time.

16:34.520 --> 16:36.060
Ah, it's not that much fun.

16:36.060 --> 16:39.260
After the seasons over, it's just a lot of witch townies.

16:39.260 --> 16:42.460
Well I love it. It's so different and exotic.

16:42.460 --> 16:43.490
Ham sandwich?

16:43.490 --> 16:44.630
Sure.

16:45.600 --> 16:47.840
Both moons are really beautiful tonight.

16:47.840 --> 16:49.060
Yeah.

16:50.160 --> 16:52.480
Hey, there's the Mars probe. Smile.

16:54.710 --> 16:56.100
Are you cold?

16:56.120 --> 16:57.260
No. I'm all right.

16:57.260 --> 16:59.020
Are you sure? Because um,

16:59.020 --> 17:00.110
I could put my arm around you.

17:00.110 --> 17:02.740
That's okay. I can just... put my arms around myself.

17:04.329 --> 17:06.880
I'm sensing you feel uncomfortable being here.

17:06.880 --> 17:08.880
Should I walk you back to the lodge?

17:08.880 --> 17:11.480
No. No, I'm enjoying this.

17:11.480 --> 17:12.089
Really?

17:12.089 --> 17:12.880
Yeah.

17:12.880 --> 17:15.780
Well I'm glad 'cause I like you Sabrina.

17:15.780 --> 17:17.609
I like you too.

17:19.720 --> 17:21.060
What are you doing?

17:21.060 --> 17:23.060
I was gonna kiss you.

17:23.060 --> 17:24.540
Kiss me? Well.

17:24.720 --> 17:26.950
I don't even know you that well. I mean...

17:26.950 --> 17:29.290
it hardly seems right to kiss someone when you...

17:29.290 --> 17:31.290
haven't even shaken hands.

17:31.290 --> 17:33.290
All right. Do you wanna shake?

17:33.620 --> 17:34.580
Okay.

17:36.430 --> 17:37.810
Now can I kiss you?

17:37.810 --> 17:38.980
I don't think so.

17:38.980 --> 17:40.080
Well why not?

17:40.080 --> 17:42.260
It's your handshake. No offence but...

17:42.260 --> 17:43.670
I've had better.

17:43.670 --> 17:45.370
Well that's not fair.

17:45.370 --> 17:47.370
We had gloves on. Give me another chance.

17:47.370 --> 17:48.230
Okay.

17:48.230 --> 17:50.830
And this time I'm really gonna mean it.

17:55.340 --> 18:00.400
Look it's not your fault. There's a guy back on earth named Harvey and...

18:00.400 --> 18:03.110
well when I shake his hand I feel all tingly and...

18:03.110 --> 18:04.640
when I shake yours well...

18:04.640 --> 18:06.640
Frankly it's a little sweaty.

18:07.250 --> 18:08.640
Is not.

18:08.840 --> 18:11.180
I'm sorry but I have to be honest.

18:12.170 --> 18:14.100
So um. D'ya wanna go back to the lodge?

18:14.640 --> 18:16.450
Nah, We can finish our picnic.

18:16.450 --> 18:18.450
I mean, we're still friends right?

18:18.450 --> 18:19.630
Of course.

18:19.630 --> 18:22.230
Friends.

18:22.470 --> 18:23.720
Anything?

18:23.720 --> 18:24.860
Sorry.

18:25.960 --> 18:29.680
We'll be back around five. Can you come by?... Great.

18:29.910 --> 18:32.370
Sabrina! We have to go.

18:32.750 --> 18:34.310
That's weird.

18:34.310 --> 18:36.310
Warren said he'd be down to say goodbye.

18:36.310 --> 18:39.810
Well maybe he was captured by the evil agents from All-state.

18:39.810 --> 18:41.710
I knew I shouldn't have told you.

18:41.710 --> 18:43.200
So he lied about everything.

18:43.200 --> 18:46.100
He was very entertaining so that makes it okay.

18:46.100 --> 18:47.160
All set.

18:48.080 --> 18:52.130
Hilda! Hilda! I was instructed to abort my mission immediately

18:52.130 --> 18:54.640
but I couldn't leave without saying goodbye.

18:54.640 --> 18:56.230
That's so sweet.

18:56.230 --> 18:59.220
Now look. We don't have much time so here.

18:59.220 --> 19:00.870
Give me your telephone number.

19:02.160 --> 19:03.760
Oh jeez! Not with that!

19:03.760 --> 19:07.560
That's my vaporising gun. Okay here. Use a ball-point.

19:07.560 --> 19:09.560
You just never give up.

19:11.210 --> 19:12.310
There you go.

19:12.310 --> 19:13.740
I'll call you.

19:15.200 --> 19:16.760
Did you hear that?

19:16.760 --> 19:18.290
What an odd noise.

19:18.290 --> 19:19.160
Oh-no!

19:19.160 --> 19:20.560
What's going on?

19:21.130 --> 19:23.710
This is the work of Doctor Cyclops!

19:23.710 --> 19:25.710
She really knows how to pick 'em.

19:27.810 --> 19:30.430
I'll-I'll always remember you, Hilda.

19:30.830 --> 19:33.320
Unless they remove my brain!

19:33.620 --> 19:35.310
I don't believe it!

19:35.550 --> 19:37.990
I guess he really was a secret agent.

19:38.230 --> 19:39.990
Apparently, not a very good one.

19:39.990 --> 19:42.890
But he told the truth. That's amazing.

19:42.890 --> 19:44.790
And very heart-warming.

19:44.790 --> 19:47.390
If he ever escapes you can bet he'll call.

19:47.390 --> 19:48.490
Yeah.

19:48.810 --> 19:51.800
Oh I just wish I'd given him my real phone number.

19:54.660 --> 19:57.790
Fluffy! FLUFFY! Wake up, they'll be back any minute!

20:00.030 --> 20:00.890
SALEM?!

20:00.890 --> 20:03.790
Someone brought cat-nip. I swear I had nothing to do with it.

20:04.440 --> 20:06.410
You are so lucky Harvey's here.

20:06.410 --> 20:08.290
Now clean this place up and...

20:08.290 --> 20:09.960
crack a window.

20:11.080 --> 20:12.910
My head.

20:15.430 --> 20:16.600
You're back!

20:16.600 --> 20:18.600
Yeah, hi. Hey, new shirt.

20:18.600 --> 20:20.600
And check out the socks.

20:20.600 --> 20:22.020
Nice!

20:22.020 --> 20:23.540
Lets go and show them off at The Slicery.

20:23.630 --> 20:25.540
Actually. Come on in.

20:26.380 --> 20:28.020
We need to talk.

20:28.270 --> 20:29.240
Talk?

20:29.240 --> 20:30.650
Yeah.

20:32.910 --> 20:36.560
You see I want us to have a completely honest relationship.

20:37.190 --> 20:38.560
Okay.

20:38.820 --> 20:43.150
And the truth is, when I was on my ski vacation, something kind of happened.

20:43.540 --> 20:44.270
Oh?

20:45.180 --> 20:46.830
I met this amazing guy.

20:46.830 --> 20:47.470
You did?

20:47.470 --> 20:49.190
But he wasn't as amazing as you,

20:49.360 --> 20:53.050
and going out with him made me realise I like you better.

20:54.820 --> 20:56.910
Okay! Lets go to The Slicery.

20:58.990 --> 21:02.010

21:04.230 --> 21:06.750

21:06.750 --> 21:08.080

21:30.360 --> 21:31.640
Let me just get my note book out. Here...

21:31.640 --> 21:35.500
...and I'll crunch some numbers on a term-life policy for ya.

21:35.500 --> 21:39.230

21:39.230 --> 21:42.610
