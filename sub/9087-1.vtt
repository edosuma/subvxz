J” EERIE MUSIC

01:30.758 --> 01:34.387
(Children shout in distance)

02:30.360 --> 02:35.198
(Children chatter outside)

02:44.165 --> 02:46.250
(Sobbing)

02:47.669 --> 02:51.172
Shh-shh-shh.

02:52.840 --> 02:55.009
- Hey.
- Peter...

02:55.009 --> 02:57.095
Shh, just a dream.

02:57.095 --> 02:59.013
- Shh.
- (Sobs)

02:59.013 --> 03:02.183
It's just a dream. Hey.

03:03.768 --> 03:07.647
Go on back to sleep.
Back to sleep.

03:08.690 --> 03:10.316
Shh.

03:12.944 --> 03:17.198
(Wind gusts, door thumps)

04:10.251 --> 04:13.588
(indistinct announcement
over PA System)

04:16.339 --> 04:18.426
(Train roars over tracks)

04:24.056 --> 04:27.143
PETER: And what's your
line of work, Felix?

04:27.143 --> 04:29.604
FELIX: I'm a musician.

04:29.604 --> 04:30.730
Jazz?

04:30.730 --> 04:33.941
What other kind of
music is there?

04:33.941 --> 04:36.068
You play anywhere?

04:36.068 --> 04:39.113
Place called Ellington's.

04:39.614 --> 04:42.575
Ellington's, on
Brunswick Street?

04:42.575 --> 04:43.951
Uh-huh.

04:44.535 --> 04:46.287
You mean you used
to play there.

04:46.287 --> 04:49.624
No... no... I played
there just last weekend.

04:49.624 --> 04:54.962
Ellington's - the place with
all the statues out the front?

04:54.962 --> 04:57.048
FELIX: That's the one.

04:58.466 --> 05:03.763
If I'm not mistaken, that
place has been gone for years.

05:04.347 --> 05:08.893
Look, I... I really don't
know what you're getting at.

05:09.852 --> 05:11.479
Can you tell me
who the President

05:11.479 --> 05:13.981
of the United
States is, Felix?

05:14.649 --> 05:16.567
What sort of a
question is that?

05:16.567 --> 05:19.862
PETER: Just curious.

05:22.073 --> 05:23.825
Ronald Reagan.

05:24.867 --> 05:26.452
And what year are we in?

05:29.872 --> 05:32.583
1987.

05:32.583 --> 05:34.043
FELIX: Right?

05:38.339 --> 05:42.802
Have we... have we met before?

05:42.802 --> 05:48.349
Yes. Right here, last week.

05:48.349 --> 05:51.936
(Buzzing)

05:54.730 --> 05:59.318
(Thunder rumbles)

06:02.363 --> 06:04.657
DUNCAN: So how's the new job?

06:04.657 --> 06:06.534
Oh, don't get me
wrong, Duncan,

06:06.534 --> 06:08.703
I appreciate you
passing a few cases,

06:08.703 --> 06:12.081
but assessment work is like...

06:12.081 --> 06:15.167
It reminds me of
being your assistant.

06:15.167 --> 06:19.547
- You miss
Sydney? - No.

06:19.547 --> 06:21.757
I miss analysis.

06:22.174 --> 06:25.720
I miss my patients, even
more than I thought I would.

06:25.720 --> 06:31.142
What do you think? You need
more help than they do now?

06:33.144 --> 06:36.814
It's not easy, facing things.

06:39.150 --> 06:41.903
And how would you face things?

06:42.612 --> 06:47.909
Pete, I'm here to
help you face it.

06:47.909 --> 06:51.412
And I really appreciate it.

06:51.412 --> 06:54.916
I wasn't even sure
you'd be alive.

06:54.916 --> 06:57.752
(Chuckles) Well...

06:58.002 --> 07:00.087
You marry the prettiest
girl on campus,

07:00.087 --> 07:01.964
you take off to
Sydney and you...

07:01.964 --> 07:04.926
...you disappear for years.

07:04.926 --> 07:07.929
Oh, you know, life.

07:09.388 --> 07:12.266
Life.

07:14.936 --> 07:19.649
So how's Carol been
through all this?

07:22.485 --> 07:24.487
Devastated.

07:26.948 --> 07:34.038
Are either of you able to...
are you able to say her name?

07:34.997 --> 07:40.127
- Yes. - Say
her name, Pete.

07:51.472 --> 07:54.058
(Whispering) Evie.

07:56.143 --> 07:58.938
Ev... Evie.

08:24.171 --> 08:25.589
Ow!

08:25.589 --> 08:27.550
Oh, baby, cut yourself?

08:27.550 --> 08:33.806
Oh, shh. Hmm. You'll live.

08:48.863 --> 08:52.742
What was it that
caught your attention?

08:52.742 --> 08:53.534
What?

08:53.534 --> 08:56.120
You said you took your
eyes off Evie that day.

08:56.120 --> 09:00.374
What exactly was it that
caught your attention?

09:14.221 --> 09:16.766
(Tires screech)

09:17.516 --> 09:20.019
Can't... can't remember.

09:22.730 --> 09:26.025
DUNCAN: It'll come to you.

09:30.446 --> 09:30.946
(Buzzing)

09:30.946 --> 09:37.828
I just need to sleep. I want
to close my eyes and...

09:37.828 --> 09:40.039
WOMAN: Just need to sleep.

09:40.039 --> 09:41.582
I'm starting to hate people.

09:41.582 --> 09:43.000
WOMAN: I don't
want to be manic.

09:43.000 --> 09:46.462
(Overlapping conversations,
clock ticks)

09:50.716 --> 09:55.429
And it was so awful...
the black, I mean.

09:55.429 --> 09:58.015
(Bike wheel clicks,
overlapping conversations)

09:58.015 --> 10:03.979
WOMAN: Am I boring
you? - I'm listening.

10:04.522 --> 10:07.858
People ignore me all
the time, you know.

10:11.445 --> 10:14.281
- Like who?
- Benny.

10:14.281 --> 10:17.243
- Who's that?
- My daughter.

10:17.243 --> 10:21.622
It's not a real name,
it's just what I call her.

10:21.622 --> 10:24.708
Although I don't know
why I call her anything.

10:24.708 --> 10:27.920
Sometimes I think
I'm invisible.

10:28.546 --> 10:30.506
Well, I see you.

10:32.633 --> 10:35.928
I wonder what I'm
doing here sometimes.

10:37.680 --> 10:42.518
- What do you mean by that?
- You know what I mean.

10:47.356 --> 10:51.277
You mean you have thoughts
of killing yourself?

10:52.653 --> 10:55.030
I just can't do it.

10:59.034 --> 11:02.496
(Train roars past,
blinds rattle)

11:07.376 --> 11:10.546
(Buzzing)

11:25.769 --> 11:27.146
Hello.

11:27.146 --> 11:30.024
Who are you here to see?

11:33.611 --> 11:37.489
Oh. ls your mum or your
dad here with you?

11:41.452 --> 11:43.913
Want to come in?

11:45.873 --> 11:47.208
Come in.

11:53.964 --> 11:58.802
I'm Dr Bower.
You can call me Peter.

11:59.553 --> 12:02.681
Have a seat.
Take your pick.

12:05.684 --> 12:10.814
(Chuckles) Good
choice. The comfy one.

12:14.985 --> 12:20.407
Have they given you a letter
or something for me to read?

12:34.588 --> 12:37.883
Elizabeth Valentine.

12:37.883 --> 12:40.010
Lovely name.

12:44.139 --> 12:46.392
Hello, Elizabeth.

12:47.393 --> 12:49.353
Can you speak?

12:53.274 --> 12:57.528
Well, I know you can read.

13:03.075 --> 13:05.703
Can you write?

13:07.288 --> 13:09.790
(Elizabeth breathes heavily)

13:22.469 --> 13:24.763
(Train rumbles past)

13:24.763 --> 13:28.809
Don't worry. Don't worry.
It's just a train.

13:28.809 --> 13:31.645
(Door opens)

13:31.645 --> 13:33.814
Hey, wait.

13:33.814 --> 13:34.982
Wait, wait!

13:34.982 --> 13:38.777
(Footsteps on
stairs, door slams)

14:30.162 --> 14:33.040
CAROL: What are you doing?

14:33.749 --> 14:39.004
Nothing. Just... looking
for an old... case file.

14:40.339 --> 14:42.508
In her box of things?

14:43.884 --> 14:48.389
- I'm sorry.
- There's no need to apologise.

14:50.265 --> 14:53.060
- Did I wake you?
- No.

14:53.060 --> 14:58.440
- Been taking your pills?
- I slept all day.

14:59.900 --> 15:03.278
I'm beginning to wonder if I
shouldn't stop taking them.

15:03.278 --> 15:07.699
So we can have a
repeat of last time?

15:09.034 --> 15:11.912
- I'm sorry.
- (Sighs)

15:11.912 --> 15:14.581
Stop apologising.

15:14.581 --> 15:17.209
Please.

15:18.293 --> 15:20.587
PETER: It's her
anniversary next week.

15:20.587 --> 15:22.840
CAROL: Anniversary?

15:23.257 --> 15:27.219
Anniversary is
something you celebrate.

15:30.722 --> 15:33.100
Why did we move here, Peter?

15:33.100 --> 15:36.228
You know why we moved here.

15:38.230 --> 15:40.399
To move on.

15:43.110 --> 15:47.364
(Thunder rumbles,
cars honk)

15:47.364 --> 15:50.534
(Thunderclaps)

15:52.536 --> 15:55.247
Shit!

16:04.423 --> 16:08.552
(Elevator dings, doors open)

16:17.769 --> 16:19.480
(Eerie breathing)

16:36.830 --> 16:40.918
(Door creaks softly)

16:40.918 --> 16:42.961
Elizabeth?

16:45.005 --> 16:46.507
How did you get in here?

16:46.507 --> 16:50.010
(Elizabeth hums tunelessly)

16:50.010 --> 16:51.929
Elizabeth?

16:53.680 --> 16:57.351
(Elizabeth hums)

17:04.733 --> 17:07.528
- What is it? -
(Continues humming)

17:07.528 --> 17:09.195
PETER: Elizabeth.

17:09.570 --> 17:13.407
- What do you see?
- (Whines strangely)

17:13.407 --> 17:14.867
PETER: Hold On.

17:14.867 --> 17:17.871
- (Whines wheezily)
- Elizabeth, listen to me.

17:17.871 --> 17:21.208
Just try and speak, OK?

17:21.208 --> 17:23.126
What is it? What is it?

17:23.126 --> 17:24.962
What's over there? Huh?

17:24.962 --> 17:27.714
(Chokes)

17:31.718 --> 17:36.098
(Train roars past,
Elizabeth breathes heavily)

17:36.098 --> 17:38.892
(Gasps)

17:41.436 --> 17:43.105
Hey, no...

17:43.814 --> 17:45.148
Come on.

17:48.026 --> 17:50.571
(Pants)

18:10.591 --> 18:12.175
Hey.

18:13.260 --> 18:14.469
Elizabeth?

18:14.469 --> 18:17.222
(Thunder rumbles)

18:24.563 --> 18:26.607
(Muffled recording
of Peter's voice)

18:26.607 --> 18:28.567
I've got to be honest
with you, Pete.

18:28.567 --> 18:32.571
All I hear is a train,
a lot of racket

18:32.571 --> 18:34.781
and you talking to yourself.

18:34.781 --> 18:37.618
If it wasn't for this doll,
you'd have a pretty hard time

18:37.618 --> 18:42.122
convincing me that you didn't
just... imagine all of this.

18:42.122 --> 18:45.250
Why would I... why
would I imagine it?

18:47.961 --> 18:51.923
- How old would Evie be now?
- Come on, Dunc.

18:51.923 --> 18:54.968
DUNCAN: Elizabeth Valentine.
That was her name, wasn't it?

18:54.968 --> 18:57.429
Yes. That was on
her train pass.

18:58.513 --> 19:02.559
- Where is her train pass?
- I gave it back to her.

19:03.977 --> 19:06.396
I just want you to
think for a bit.

19:06.396 --> 19:08.565
- Just take her initials.
- Whose?

19:08.565 --> 19:10.734
The girl's, Elizabeth
Valentine's.

19:10.734 --> 19:13.904
- Take her initials.
- E-V.

19:23.830 --> 19:28.669
What about the doll?
Where did that come from?

19:28.669 --> 19:30.379
Anywhere. It could be...

19:30.379 --> 19:34.007
Could be Evie's. Have you been
through her things lately?

19:34.007 --> 19:35.175
You're making it...

19:35.175 --> 19:38.595
You're making it sound
like something it's not.

19:39.680 --> 19:41.264
Sit down.

19:49.606 --> 19:54.361
- It's OK, Pete.
- Doesn't feel OK.

19:54.361 --> 19:56.321
Good.

19:56.321 --> 19:59.700
As Jung would say, 'Now
we're getting somewhere.'

19:59.700 --> 20:05.831
So, just relax, and tell me
exactly what you're feeling.

20:06.998 --> 20:09.710
(Breathes deeply)

20:13.839 --> 20:19.553
That's funny. I never
noticed that before.

20:19.553 --> 20:21.555
What?

20:22.889 --> 20:24.725
PETER: That painting.

20:25.600 --> 20:28.687
I've been having
dreams about that.

20:29.604 --> 20:33.066
DUNCAN: Winter Landscape
With A Bird Trap.

20:33.066 --> 20:33.775
Simple title.

20:33.775 --> 20:36.403
But when you look
closely at a Bruegel,

20:36.403 --> 20:39.072
you usually find
there's something odd,

20:39.072 --> 20:41.116
some devil in the detail.

20:46.496 --> 20:48.832
PETER: It's the bird trap.

20:50.375 --> 20:53.837
You can't see the bird
trapper hiding in the window.

20:56.923 --> 20:59.092
That's what disturbs
me in the dream.

20:59.092 --> 21:03.096
The dream is
asking a question.

21:03.096 --> 21:05.056
Who's pulling the string?

21:05.056 --> 21:09.269
Who is it that you don't
want to see, Peter?

21:09.269 --> 21:11.855
What?

21:12.522 --> 21:15.192
Who is it in that window?

21:20.238 --> 21:22.616
(Train rumbles)

22:00.570 --> 22:04.533
(Buzzing)

22:16.878 --> 22:21.174
(Door creaks softly)

22:34.688 --> 22:37.941
(Whispering) We have her.

22:40.610 --> 22:43.071
(Whispering) Who?

22:43.071 --> 22:45.198
PETER: Evie.

23:05.093 --> 23:07.762
(Sobs)

23:18.398 --> 23:21.776
(Thumping)

23:24.195 --> 23:28.450
(Door thumps)

23:32.245 --> 23:36.708
(Thumping and creaking)

23:47.427 --> 23:51.932
(Closes and locks door)

24:25.090 --> 24:28.176
(Train rattles)

24:39.646 --> 24:41.398
Missed your stop.

24:43.483 --> 24:46.236
Erica. Your patient.

24:47.153 --> 24:52.742
- Erica...
- You've been sleeping.

24:55.036 --> 24:56.705
What was the last station?

24:56.705 --> 24:58.999
Do you remember
what we talked about

24:58.999 --> 25:01.001
in your room the other day?

25:01.126 --> 25:05.505
I've been thinking about it,
how I can't kill myself.

25:05.505 --> 25:10.301
- Have you?
- I'm sorry. I need to...

25:10.301 --> 25:11.803
I've realised why.

25:11.803 --> 25:14.514
It's simple. I'm already...

25:14.514 --> 25:17.642
(Metallic screeching,
loud bang)

25:28.028 --> 25:32.741
(Eerie whispering)

25:45.128 --> 25:49.591
(Breathes deeply)

27:01.121 --> 27:03.414
Duncan, it's Peter.

27:04.666 --> 27:06.501
Please...

27:06.501 --> 27:09.879
I know it's late.
Please give me a call.

27:09.879 --> 27:12.382
(Sniffles) Please.

27:53.131 --> 27:54.382
PETER: The really
weird thing is

27:54.382 --> 27:57.594
they all seem to have died
within a day of each other.

27:57.594 --> 28:00.680
DUNCAN: July 12th?
- Yes.

28:03.016 --> 28:06.144
Does that date mean
anything to you?

28:07.187 --> 28:10.190
- No.
- You're sure?

28:10.190 --> 28:12.358
Just think.

28:15.361 --> 28:18.072
Look, Dunc, I wouldn't be
bringing this up to you

28:18.072 --> 28:21.242
if I didn't think it was
crazy myself, but...

28:22.243 --> 28:23.620
Look...

28:25.038 --> 28:27.123
These are the patients.

28:28.625 --> 28:31.252
Here's the list.

28:40.261 --> 28:42.430
You're not saying anything.

28:44.182 --> 28:48.394
I know if l...
I think logically...

28:49.187 --> 28:51.397
...I must be hallucinating
the whole thing.

28:51.397 --> 28:54.192
Like there's a
kind of breakdown.

28:54.192 --> 28:58.154
But there are things
that don't add up,

28:58.154 --> 29:00.323
even if that were the case.

29:01.157 --> 29:02.700
Like what?

29:03.409 --> 29:07.330
Like the fact that you
referred me these patients.

29:09.999 --> 29:13.419
Well, if I referred
you your patients...

29:14.754 --> 29:18.424
...what would that make me?

29:45.076 --> 29:47.078
1987.

31:02.320 --> 31:06.866
(indistinct announcements
over PA system)

32:18.646 --> 32:21.899
(Doorbell rings musically)

32:32.118 --> 32:35.746
- Well...
- Hi, Dad.

32:35.746 --> 32:38.082
Come in.

32:38.374 --> 32:40.877
(Door creaks and shuts)

32:43.254 --> 32:45.965
Aren't you supposed
to be busy?

32:52.305 --> 32:54.390
You drive up?

32:54.390 --> 32:56.809
No, took the train.

32:56.809 --> 32:58.811
How's work?

33:00.646 --> 33:03.107
Work's... whatever.

33:05.610 --> 33:07.862
You ever throw anything out?

33:11.407 --> 33:12.575
So what's happened?

33:12.575 --> 33:15.369
- What do you mean?
- What's really going on?

33:15.369 --> 33:18.164
You turn up
unannounced, no car,

33:18.164 --> 33:20.500
an overnight bag,
without Carol.

33:20.500 --> 33:22.460
You two OK?

33:22.627 --> 33:26.005
- I thought I was the shrink.
- Yeah. (Chuckles)

33:26.005 --> 33:27.173
I'm the cop.

33:27.173 --> 33:29.675
- Retired, remember?
- Mm.

33:29.675 --> 33:33.763
- I've still got a nose.
- Yeah.

33:40.186 --> 33:42.855
I saw you took down
the photos of Mum.

33:42.855 --> 33:46.108
It's been ten years.

33:50.112 --> 33:52.657
WILLIAM: Don't touch that.

33:54.867 --> 33:57.203
What do you do in here anyway?

33:57.203 --> 33:59.372
Man stuff.

34:00.540 --> 34:02.833
Man stuff!

34:02.833 --> 34:06.504
You were always in here when
I was a kid, avoiding us.

34:09.882 --> 34:13.636
Sorry I didn't come
to Evie's funeral.

34:15.012 --> 34:16.722
I was too upset.

34:19.641 --> 34:23.062
Is that what you're
calling drunk these days?

34:25.398 --> 34:29.068
- How long are you staying?
- Couple of days.

34:29.068 --> 34:31.612
Guess you want your room back.

34:33.072 --> 34:37.743
(Door creaks softly)

34:39.579 --> 34:42.790
(Floorboards creak)

34:50.130 --> 34:52.675
(Sighs)

35:17.366 --> 35:20.995
(Door creaks)

35:24.415 --> 35:28.294
(Door creaks)

36:34.151 --> 36:36.195
Want something to eat?

36:37.113 --> 36:38.406
Nah.

36:41.283 --> 36:42.952
Don't wait up.

36:55.047 --> 36:56.966
(Door closes)

37:08.227 --> 37:10.020
PETER: Hi, Baz.

37:13.399 --> 37:15.860
Jesus Christ.

37:17.945 --> 37:20.156
Fuck, mate.

37:20.156 --> 37:24.243
You've had a really
shit couple of years.

37:24.243 --> 37:27.037
It's good to see you, though.

37:28.706 --> 37:30.958
Fuckin' life, ey?

37:31.584 --> 37:34.378
I mean, I... I can't
even imagine...

37:34.378 --> 37:37.423
...what it is you must
be going through.

37:37.923 --> 37:40.468
It's made me think a
lot about my past.

37:40.468 --> 37:47.141
Addressing it, you know...
the things I've done.

37:48.225 --> 37:50.978
I wanted to talk to
you about something.

37:52.146 --> 37:53.939
BARRY: What?

37:56.025 --> 37:58.778
About what happened.

38:01.238 --> 38:03.532
What are you talking about?

38:06.327 --> 38:08.788
1987.

38:10.372 --> 38:12.750
1987, you know.

38:13.751 --> 38:15.461
You're not talking about...

38:15.461 --> 38:20.299
- (Sighs) Shit. We promised...
- Yeah, we were young.

38:20.299 --> 38:21.801
...we would never
talk about that.

38:21.801 --> 38:26.347
- We were teenagers.
- Exactly. We were just kids.

38:28.182 --> 38:32.728
I... can't help but think...

38:35.356 --> 38:37.900
...Evie's death
had something...

38:37.900 --> 38:39.985
some kind of...

38:40.194 --> 38:41.195
...I don't know...

38:41.195 --> 38:44.198
- What?
Some kind of what?

38:47.159 --> 38:50.704
Look, I don't even really know
what happened that night.

38:50.704 --> 38:52.915
And neither do you.
- People died.

38:52.915 --> 38:56.544
- Can we please just drop this?
- People died!

38:56.544 --> 38:59.964
Right, so, you come
all the way back here

38:59.964 --> 39:01.382
just to dig this shit up.

39:01.382 --> 39:04.343
I don't know... maybe.

39:04.343 --> 39:07.763
Maybe I just had to
clear my conscience.

39:09.390 --> 39:13.102
With Who? With Who?

39:15.020 --> 39:16.772
With the police?

39:17.773 --> 39:19.275
- I don't know...
- Look.

39:19.275 --> 39:22.528
I'm not you, alright?
I'm not rich.

39:22.528 --> 39:24.196
I can't afford lawyers.

39:24.196 --> 39:25.197
They put people in jail

39:25.197 --> 39:27.449
for this sort of shit
for fucking years.

39:27.449 --> 39:29.743
I got to live in
this bloody town.

39:30.452 --> 39:32.705
Do you believe in ghosts?

39:32.705 --> 39:38.252
(Sighs) You know what?
Fuck you, Peter.

39:38.252 --> 39:39.211
FUCK you!

39:39.211 --> 39:43.424
You stay the fuck
away from me. Got it?

39:49.889 --> 39:54.059
(Floorboards creak)

40:30.054 --> 40:33.515
(Bicycles rattle)

40:36.769 --> 40:39.438
YOUNG PETER: Remind me again.
Why are we doing this?

40:39.438 --> 40:42.691
YOUNG BARRY: Because we're
14 and we're virgins.

40:42.691 --> 40:45.444
If this is a make-out place,
don't we need chicks?

40:45.444 --> 40:47.780
YOUNG BARRY: As if you'd
know what to do with one.

40:47.780 --> 40:50.741
YOUNG PETER: How do you know
about this place anyway?

40:50.741 --> 40:53.077
- Steve told me.
- Your brother?

40:53.077 --> 40:55.621
- And you believed him?
- Why wouldn't I?

40:55.621 --> 40:59.249
- He hates you.
- What would you know?

40:59.249 --> 41:01.168
Just trust me.

41:11.095 --> 41:12.930
YOUNG BARRY: You coming?

41:29.989 --> 41:33.742
Oh! Check that out. Jackpot.

41:40.374 --> 41:42.793
Dinner and a show.

41:47.756 --> 41:50.801
How do you know it's not
two blokes in there?

41:50.801 --> 41:52.886
What's wrong with you?

41:53.929 --> 41:56.765
I don't know. Maybe we
shouldn't be watching this.

41:56.765 --> 41:59.393
OK, Richie
Cunningham. Then go.

41:59.393 --> 42:01.645
I'll let you know
how it ends.

42:05.566 --> 42:07.568
(Girl yelps)
- What was that?

42:07.568 --> 42:08.235
- Shit.

42:08.235 --> 42:10.029
- Do you think they saw us?
- Shh.

42:10.029 --> 42:11.864
- I think they saw us.
- Shh.

42:11.864 --> 42:13.866
- Did you hear that?
- Hear what?

42:13.866 --> 42:15.993
- Listen.
(Train horn hoots)

42:15.993 --> 42:18.370
- Train.
- Shit, the bikes!

42:28.964 --> 42:30.299

44:47.436 --> 44:49.062

44:53.692 --> 44:56.612
- (Screams)
(Train thunders)

44:59.656 --> 45:01.116

(Soft rustling)

48:34.746 --> 48:38.083
(Wind gusts)

49:12.534 --> 49:15.120
So you were the
only one involved.

49:15.120 --> 49:17.497
That's right.

49:18.290 --> 49:23.670
You're... you're not related
to Bill Bower, by any chance?

49:24.129 --> 49:27.591
I'm his son.
(Clears throat)

49:28.842 --> 49:32.512
Wasn't your dad
sergeant at the time?

49:33.180 --> 49:35.599
You never mentioned
this to him?

49:37.100 --> 49:39.144
No.

49:39.144 --> 49:41.771
So why bring it up now?

49:42.939 --> 49:45.984
(Sighs)

49:45.984 --> 49:50.155
I just want to...
put things to rest.

49:51.198 --> 49:52.699
Properly.

49:56.328 --> 49:59.539
Can you excuse
me for a second?

50:43.625 --> 50:45.627
Sorry about that.

50:47.420 --> 50:50.465
- Is that your mum?
- Yeah.

50:50.465 --> 50:53.552
She died in the accident.

50:53.552 --> 50:58.807
- I'm sorry.
- Well, it's no secret.

50:58.807 --> 51:00.892
It... it must have
been very hard

51:00.892 --> 51:02.561
for you to hear my statement.

51:02.561 --> 51:05.063
Well, it's my job.

51:05.438 --> 51:08.900
- I meant, you know...
- Yeah, I know what you meant.

51:10.986 --> 51:15.031
Not many people could have
faced up to what you did.

51:15.031 --> 51:17.951
I really appreciate
your honesty.

51:19.327 --> 51:22.247
I'll file a report
with the coroner.

51:22.247 --> 51:25.333
I can't imagine
there'll be any charges.

51:25.333 --> 51:27.085
You were just a teenager.

51:27.085 --> 51:31.506
It was an act of
negligence at worst.

51:32.465 --> 51:38.013
(Breathes deeply)
Thank you.

51:42.851 --> 51:45.520
I...

51:45.520 --> 51:47.314
I came to your house once.

51:47.314 --> 51:52.694
Your dad invited me over
right after the accident.

51:52.694 --> 51:56.156
Mum was the only local
who died in the accident.

51:57.991 --> 52:01.161
He was very kind
to me, your dad.

52:02.287 --> 52:07.083
I think it was after that
I wanted to be a cop.

52:20.430 --> 52:21.389
(Answering machine beeps)

52:21.389 --> 52:24.476
PETER: Hi, sweetheart.
I'm... I'm at my dad's.

52:24.476 --> 52:27.062
I'm sorry I haven't
called until now.

52:27.771 --> 52:31.524
I had to come back and put
something to rest here,

52:31.524 --> 52:35.612
something that happened
a long time ago.

52:36.821 --> 52:41.034
Things will get better,
Carol. I promise.

52:43.495 --> 52:45.455
I love you.

52:47.832 --> 52:48.792

(Whispering) Stay away.

55:51.891 --> 55:55.186
That's no way to talk
to an old friend, Peter.

55:55.186 --> 55:57.564
Wha... what do you want?

55:57.564 --> 56:03.361
It's not what I want.
We're your ghosts, Peter.

56:03.361 --> 56:06.239
You're the one that's
holding on to us.

56:06.656 --> 56:10.243
I put it to rest.
I told the truth.

56:10.243 --> 56:13.621
Then why are we still here?

56:14.372 --> 56:17.417
Two bikes
derailing a train engine.

56:17.417 --> 56:20.169
Do you really think
that's possible?

56:20.420 --> 56:24.382
Listen, some memories
are so unacceptable,

56:24.382 --> 56:27.135
we'll do anything we
can to forget them.

56:27.135 --> 56:30.263
And if that doesn't
work, we change them.

56:30.263 --> 56:31.222
Look at you.

56:31.222 --> 56:34.267
You barely remember your
own daughter's death.

56:34.267 --> 56:36.185
What does that have
to do with this?

56:36.185 --> 56:41.691
Well, I don't know, but
you must, somewhere inside.

56:41.691 --> 56:45.737
Peter, what distracted you?

56:45.737 --> 56:50.783
You said you looked
away the day Evie died.

56:50.783 --> 56:52.869
What was it?

56:52.869 --> 56:56.748
What is it you
don't want to remember?

59:37.325 --> 59:40.411
(indistinct talk over phone)

59:40.411 --> 59:43.748
Don't touch a thing.
I'll be right there.

59:43.748 --> 59:47.001
(Chatter on police radio)

01:00:02.141 --> 01:00:04.227
So here we are again.

01:00:05.394 --> 01:00:06.854
What happened?

01:00:09.649 --> 01:00:11.359
I just found him
there like that.

01:00:11.359 --> 01:00:13.194
No, that's not what I meant.

01:00:13.194 --> 01:00:16.405
This isn't a
coincidence, is it?

01:00:18.032 --> 01:00:21.619
We both left our
bikes on the track.

01:00:21.619 --> 01:00:23.287
(Sighs)

01:00:23.287 --> 01:00:27.291
I told... I told Barry
last night that...

01:00:27.291 --> 01:00:29.794
I was going to make a
statement to the police.

01:00:29.794 --> 01:00:31.754
(Sniffles) He begged
me not to mention him.

01:00:31.754 --> 01:00:35.049
So what am I supposed
to believe now? This story?

01:00:35.049 --> 01:00:35.591
He begged me.

01:00:35.591 --> 01:00:37.093
Or the one you spun
me this morning?

01:00:37.093 --> 01:00:41.430
He's a friend. I didn't
want to drag him into this.

01:00:42.682 --> 01:00:44.851
I'm sorry.

01:00:46.144 --> 01:00:49.605
When you get your head
clear, I expect a call.

01:00:54.443 --> 01:00:55.945
Take him home.

01:01:51.626 --> 01:01:53.669
(Sighs)

01:02:43.344 --> 01:02:46.806
(Panting)

01:02:50.101 --> 01:02:53.062
(Deep breath)

01:03:07.493 --> 01:03:09.495
Found this at the scene,

01:03:09.495 --> 01:03:11.289
some trinket between
the floorboards.

01:03:11.289 --> 01:03:14.500
Looks like it's been
there a while. Goodnight.

01:03:14.500 --> 01:03:15.835
G'night.

01:03:24.302 --> 01:03:27.054
PETER: I think she
wasn't on the train.

01:03:27.805 --> 01:03:32.977
I think I remember seeing
her running from a car

01:03:32.977 --> 01:03:35.896
just before the accident.

01:03:36.147 --> 01:03:38.733
Youfh/nkyou
remember seeing her.

01:03:38.733 --> 01:03:41.986
How do you know
what she looks like?

01:03:46.157 --> 01:03:49.952
(Sighs) You're going
to think I'm crazy.

01:03:54.081 --> 01:03:55.833
I...

01:03:56.876 --> 01:03:59.420
I lost my daughter
last year.

01:04:00.046 --> 01:04:03.841
I think... I think it
opened me up to something.

01:04:03.841 --> 01:04:07.094
I... I don't know.

01:04:09.263 --> 01:04:11.349
But I see them...

01:04:12.391 --> 01:04:15.019
...the people from
the accident.

01:04:20.649 --> 01:04:24.070
Look, I'm asking
you to help me.

01:04:26.197 --> 01:04:32.078
I don't think I can help you
in the way that you need help.

01:04:35.581 --> 01:04:42.755
Your mother, Erica,
has an English accent.

01:04:43.381 --> 01:04:45.424
She called you Benny.

01:04:46.300 --> 01:04:48.511
She's got quite a temper.

01:04:48.511 --> 01:04:51.806
Look, I don't know what
you're playing at, Peter...

01:04:51.806 --> 01:04:55.976
How would I know that? How?

01:04:57.728 --> 01:05:00.064
Am I right?

01:05:00.731 --> 01:05:04.568
You're not helping yourself
or anyone at the moment.

01:05:04.568 --> 01:05:06.070
You need to go home.

01:05:06.070 --> 01:05:10.241
Just leave here and go home!

01:06:10.468 --> 01:06:14.889
(Whispering)
Please... show me.

01:06:17.641 --> 01:06:23.814
Elizabeth...
Elizabeth Valentine.

01:06:23.814 --> 01:06:25.774
(Thump!)

01:06:27.693 --> 01:06:30.029
(Thump!)
(Gasps)

01:06:37.244 --> 01:06:41.540
(Exhales) Jesus.

01:08:01.161 --> 01:08:03.163
(Pants)

01:08:03.163 --> 01:08:06.834
(Level crossing bell rings)

01:08:09.211 --> 01:08:11.213
(Girl screams)

01:08:27.770 --> 01:08:32.192
Barb. What time is it?

01:08:32.192 --> 01:08:33.484
It's late.

01:08:33.484 --> 01:08:36.529
If you're looking for
Peter, he's not here.

01:08:36.529 --> 01:08:39.241
It's probably a good thing.

01:08:39.950 --> 01:08:42.118
Can we talk?

01:08:42.953 --> 01:08:46.749
- Thanks.
- What's on your mind?

01:08:48.834 --> 01:08:53.130
I pulled out your old
report on the train crash.

01:08:53.631 --> 01:08:54.923
Do you remember it at all?

01:08:54.923 --> 01:08:59.136
You're talking about something
that happened 20 years ago.

01:08:59.136 --> 01:09:06.060
You're right. I just want
to clarify a few things.

01:09:06.060 --> 01:09:07.895
Listen, Barb...

01:09:07.895 --> 01:09:11.231
I understand you lost
someone in the accident.

01:09:11.231 --> 01:09:16.444
It's personal for you. But
whatever was done is done.

01:09:16.444 --> 01:09:20.991
And whatever way you cut it,
it was still just an accident.

01:09:20.991 --> 01:09:23.327
And I'm still obliged
to investigate

01:09:23.327 --> 01:09:24.328
your son's statement.

01:09:24.328 --> 01:09:27.331
Especially in light
of Barry's suicide.

01:09:27.581 --> 01:09:31.835
Two boys mistakenly leave
their bikes on a train track.

01:09:31.835 --> 01:09:33.504
It's, at best, manslaughter.

01:09:33.504 --> 01:09:36.131
The State can't
prosecute a manslaughter

01:09:36.131 --> 01:09:37.341
four years after the fact.

01:09:37.341 --> 01:09:42.680
I'm not sure it happened
exactly like that.

01:09:51.188 --> 01:09:53.314
(Stairs creak)

01:10:01.365 --> 01:10:06.662
You say here that you received
a call at the police station,

01:10:06.662 --> 01:10:09.373
and you proceeded to
drive to the accident.

01:10:09.373 --> 01:10:12.209
- Yes.
- What road did you take?

01:10:12.209 --> 01:10:15.796
Well, there's only one road.
Oakstone.

01:10:15.796 --> 01:10:17.673
- Oakstone?
- Mm-hmm.

01:10:17.673 --> 01:10:22.553
The level crossing at Oakstone
Road was completely blocked

01:10:22.553 --> 01:10:23.345
by the wreckage.

01:10:23.345 --> 01:10:29.101
So... how did you drive
across the tracks?

01:10:29.768 --> 01:10:31.729
The only way your
car could have been

01:10:31.729 --> 01:10:33.480
on the other side
of the tracks...

01:10:33.480 --> 01:10:37.109
...is if it was there
before the accident.

01:10:45.659 --> 01:10:47.870
(Girl screams)

01:10:47.870 --> 01:10:49.955
(Girl cries)

01:10:50.581 --> 01:10:54.126
They found this in the
signal box this evening.

01:11:03.302 --> 01:11:08.640
And I'm pretty sure it
belongs to... this girl.

01:11:09.767 --> 01:11:13.103
Elizabeth Valentine.
Missing schoolgirl.

01:11:13.103 --> 01:11:14.897
<i>'</i> (Chokeg-hump!)

01:11:14.897 --> 01:11:17.775
You remember
the case, don't you?

01:11:17.775 --> 01:11:20.110
You were in charge.

01:11:20.527 --> 01:11:23.197
After they found her
body in the wreckage,

01:11:23.197 --> 01:11:25.824
you closed the investigation.

01:11:26.366 --> 01:11:28.660
Out of all the victims
in the coroner's report,

01:11:28.660 --> 01:11:32.790
hers was the only
inconclusive cause of death.

01:11:32.790 --> 01:11:35.459
(Chokes and gasps)

01:11:35.459 --> 01:11:36.752
Come here.

01:11:36.752 --> 01:11:39.671

01:11:42.466 --> 01:11:46.804
(Crashing)

01:11:47.930 --> 01:11:52.059
I think your son saw
something that night.

01:11:52.059 --> 01:11:55.437
And I think you
know what he saw.

01:12:29.179 --> 01:12:35.394
Well, you'll have to ask
Peter what he thinks he saw.

01:12:35.936 --> 01:12:39.481
I stand by my
original statement.

01:12:42.901 --> 01:12:47.155
(Clattering)

01:13:25.652 --> 01:13:28.864
Do you mind if I
wait here for Peter?

01:13:28.864 --> 01:13:31.700
- Be my guest.

01:13:40.626 --> 01:13:44.379
Another cup of tea?
- No, thanks.

What are you doing up?

01:15:04.710 --> 01:15:06.503
I was worried.
You took my car.

01:15:06.503 --> 01:15:09.589
Where have you been?
What have you been up to?

01:15:10.465 --> 01:15:14.845
- Remembering.
- Remembering what?

01:15:16.013 --> 01:15:19.099
I remembered everything.

01:15:19.975 --> 01:15:22.769
What are you talking about?

01:15:23.520 --> 01:15:26.440
Elizabeth Valentine.

01:15:28.692 --> 01:15:30.819
I saw you...

01:15:30.819 --> 01:15:34.406
I saw you...
rape and kill her

01:15:34.406 --> 01:15:37.701
and throw her body
in the wreck.

01:15:38.869 --> 01:15:43.957
That's... That's crazy.

01:15:46.043 --> 01:15:47.794
You're talking crazily.

01:15:47.794 --> 01:15:51.548
You're upset. Come
inside. It's freezing.

01:15:51.548 --> 01:15:54.593
I'm giving you a chance, Dad.

01:15:56.178 --> 01:15:59.556
I want you to call.
- Call who?

01:15:59.556 --> 01:16:01.892
Confess.

01:16:02.726 --> 01:16:05.062
You're all mixed up.

01:16:05.062 --> 01:16:07.731
Do it or I'll do it for you.

01:16:10.150 --> 01:16:12.527
Who are you calling?

01:16:13.987 --> 01:16:16.073
Don't do this, son.

01:16:17.074 --> 01:16:20.786
I'm warning you.
(Cell phone rings)

01:16:27.959 --> 01:16:30.295
What have you done?

01:16:31.338 --> 01:16:33.507
Get in the garage.

01:16:37.177 --> 01:16:39.721
I said get in the garage.

01:17:01.785 --> 01:17:04.663
Hold your hands out.

01:17:06.081 --> 01:17:08.250
How did it feel
letting me believe

01:17:08.250 --> 01:17:10.794
it was my fault
all these years?

01:17:11.503 --> 01:17:14.381
Do you think
you're so innocent?

01:17:14.381 --> 01:17:15.715
You kept quiet about it too.

01:17:15.715 --> 01:17:20.011
Apple doesn't fall
that far from the tree.

01:17:20.512 --> 01:17:23.390
I said hold out your hands.

01:17:27.644 --> 01:17:30.021
How many other
girls did you kill?

01:17:37.112 --> 01:17:41.741

going to make it go away.
