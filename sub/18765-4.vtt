WEBVTT

00:00.960 --> 00:02.166
Previously on Grimm...

00:02.240 --> 00:04.891
It's powerful, but we don't
know where that power comes from-

00:07.080 --> 00:09.162
What is it?
I didn't wanna put it back.

00:09.480 --> 00:10.481
Why?

00:10.840 --> 00:12.922
It felt like I needed it.
Do you?

00:13.400 --> 00:15.448
Well, it saved my life.
And mine.

00:15.680 --> 00:17.284
I suppose you want
your old job back.

00:17.600 --> 00:18.761
Wu and Hank, too.

00:18.920 --> 00:20.160
Sure. Anything else?

00:20.440 --> 00:22.568
I raise my son.
I raise my daughter.

00:22.760 --> 00:23.966
And Adalind comes with me.

00:24.280 --> 00:25.486
You're not my daddy!

00:32.280 --> 00:33.520
I tried to tell you.

00:34.320 --> 00:35.731
You chose the wrong side, Sean.

00:56.320 --> 00:57.401
You're not real.

00:58.400 --> 01:00.323
Real enough that you're
talking to me. No.

01:02.360 --> 01:03.361
No, you're dead.

01:04.480 --> 01:05.606
Does that really matter?

01:11.200 --> 01:12.361
What do you want?

01:12.960 --> 01:14.007
What do you want?

01:14.160 --> 01:15.810
I want you to get
the hell out of here.

01:15.880 --> 01:17.484
I'm not gonna make it
that easy for you.

01:22.000 --> 01:23.047
Oh, I'm here.

01:23.760 --> 01:25.524
You sure you wanna
do this so soon,

01:25.600 --> 01:27.045
after your little
tussle with Nick?

01:30.360 --> 01:32.010
Go ahead. Take it.

01:33.360 --> 01:34.361
I'm in no hurry.

01:40.400 --> 01:42.448
What? I saw what
you did on the news-

01:43.440 --> 01:44.441
That wasn't me.

01:44.520 --> 01:45.931
Do you know
how much time and blood

01:46.040 --> 01:47.405
it took to get
you elected mayor?

01:47.840 --> 01:48.841
That was the Grimm.

01:49.200 --> 01:50.247
HOW?

01:50.320 --> 01:51.446
If you really want to know,

01:51.520 --> 01:54.046
it's an ancient Hexenbiest
shape-shifting spell

01:54.120 --> 01:55.770
called the Verfluchte
Zwillingsschwester.

01:56.160 --> 01:58.731
You're a Zauberbiest, you should
have known this would happen-

01:58.960 --> 02:00.336
Oh, really?
You have a lot of experience

02:00.360 --> 02:01.856
with the Verfluchte
Zwillingsschwester?

02:01.880 --> 02:04.121
If Bonaparte was still alive,
you wouldn't be.

02:04.360 --> 02:06.203
Your mistake has cost us
more than you know.

02:06.280 --> 02:08.720
No, my mistake was thinking that
you knew what you were doing.

02:16.880 --> 02:18.530
Why did Nick look like Daddy?

02:19.880 --> 02:22.451
Uh... It's complicated.

02:22.520 --> 02:25.888
Daddy was in trouble,

02:26.560 --> 02:27.800
and we were trying to help.

02:28.240 --> 02:30.163
Why didn't you help him? I did.

02:30.920 --> 02:31.921
We all did.

02:32.000 --> 02:35.209
But Nick was the one
who had to become him

02:35.280 --> 02:37.965
so that he could do what
your daddy couldn't do

02:38.400 --> 02:41.324
when he needed to do something

02:41.400 --> 02:43.004
he couldn't really do,

02:43.080 --> 02:45.003
because, well, you know...

02:45.080 --> 02:46.081
Nick.

02:46.800 --> 02:48.040
Nick's here. Okay.

02:48.120 --> 02:49.920
Glad you got those clothes
changed so quickly.

02:50.440 --> 02:51.930
Those are my daddy's clothes.

02:52.920 --> 02:54.206
Yeah, I had to borrow them.

02:56.600 --> 02:57.761
Is Daddy okay?

02:58.280 --> 02:59.930
He's better now.

03:00.920 --> 03:01.967
Are you okay?

03:02.480 --> 03:03.606
I wanna see my daddy.

03:05.160 --> 03:07.401
Uh, we'll see Daddy soon, honey,

03:07.480 --> 03:12.202
but right now, we are gonna go
and live with Nick and Kelly.

03:13.240 --> 03:15.607
It's Kelly's turn to be
with his daddy now, okay?

03:29.440 --> 03:30.965
You have a baby in you.

03:33.120 --> 03:34.804
No, not a baby.

03:35.960 --> 03:37.041
What? Oh, God.

03:38.480 --> 03:39.481
More than one.

03:41.840 --> 03:43.251
I'm guessing
we didn't know this.

03:43.920 --> 03:44.921
How many more?

03:45.640 --> 03:47.244
I don't know. Just more.

03:48.080 --> 03:50.401
Well, congratulations.

03:51.960 --> 03:54.247
I think we should be going now.
Yeah.

03:54.600 --> 03:56.409
I'll, uh... I'll get Kelly.

03:57.000 --> 03:58.047
Come on, honey.

04:05.480 --> 04:06.845
What kind of look was that?

04:06.920 --> 04:08.160
I don't know. That was a look.

04:08.240 --> 04:09.856
Yeah, that was a look.
That was a creepy look.

04:09.880 --> 04:12.136
I mean, am I the only one who
thinks that was a creepy look?

04:12.160 --> 04:14.925
Don't go there. I've already gone there.
"More than one."

05:05.200 --> 05:06.361
Smile.

05:09.560 --> 05:11.324
Okay, we're done.
No, no, just a couple more.

05:11.400 --> 05:13.880
No, no, no, please, no more. You
have enough to choose from.

05:14.720 --> 05:17.087
Don't you? You've got
100 you took yesterday,

05:17.560 --> 05:20.291
and the day before that,
and the day before that.

05:20.520 --> 05:21.806
Get that little head down.

05:24.520 --> 05:25.736
I think he feels a little warm.

05:25.760 --> 05:26.886
Yeah? Mmm-hmm.

05:27.560 --> 05:29.528
Maybe it's a fever.
I don't know.

05:29.840 --> 05:31.160
I was holding him
for a long time.

05:31.760 --> 05:33.330
I'm taking his temperature.

05:33.400 --> 05:35.243
Just don't take
any pictures of it.

05:36.280 --> 05:39.170
One day, you'll thank me for
recording our son's young life.

05:39.240 --> 05:40.416
I don't think
I'll live long enough

05:40.440 --> 05:42.249
to go through all the pictures.

05:43.280 --> 05:44.327
99.3.

05:44.760 --> 05:47.256
If it gets any higher, you should take
him to the doctor in the morning.

05:47.280 --> 05:48.406
Okay-

05:51.760 --> 05:53.416
I'm going to bed.
Yep. I'll be right there.

05:53.440 --> 05:54.930
I'm just gonna
upload these photos.

05:55.040 --> 05:56.451
Yeah, I know.

06:10.280 --> 06:12.362
Is it my turn?

06:12.920 --> 06:14.046
I'll go.

06:14.120 --> 06:15.201
Thank you.

06:17.160 --> 06:18.321
Thank you.

06:30.200 --> 06:31.247
What?

06:32.640 --> 06:34.536
Oh, my God, what are you doing?
What are you doing?

06:34.560 --> 06:37.928
Put him down! Put him down!

06:41.720 --> 06:42.926
Haley?

06:46.280 --> 06:48.567
Haley. Haley.

06:49.720 --> 06:51.085
It took our baby. What?

06:52.680 --> 06:54.409
It took our baby.

07:31.000 --> 07:32.161
Home sweet home.

07:32.240 --> 07:33.366
Welcome back.

07:34.000 --> 07:35.365
I've been here before.

07:36.120 --> 07:37.281
Right.

07:37.360 --> 07:38.964
So I guess
you don't need a tour.

07:41.360 --> 07:42.805
Where's my room?

07:44.160 --> 07:46.288
It's not like
Daddy's place, honey.

07:46.400 --> 07:48.164
Got a little less space here.

07:57.720 --> 07:59.085
What's wrong?

08:02.000 --> 08:03.684
A lot of people died here.

08:08.800 --> 08:10.086
I wanna see Daddy.

08:15.520 --> 08:17.602
I'll take you to
see him tomorrow, okay?

08:19.000 --> 08:21.048
I know it's hard
moving around this much,

08:21.120 --> 08:24.124
but I'm just trying
to keep us together and safe.

08:26.320 --> 08:29.085
I'm so proud of the way
you're handling all of this.

08:42.240 --> 08:43.844
Diana's asleep.

08:43.960 --> 08:45.405
- You sure?
- Yeah.

08:48.560 --> 08:50.801
She knew Rosalee
was gonna have a kid.

08:51.760 --> 08:54.127
She could sense
that people died here.

08:54.200 --> 08:55.884
She has amazing abilities,

08:55.960 --> 08:58.531
ones I don't understand, and I
don't know where they came from.

08:59.040 --> 09:00.644
Sean doesn't know either.

09:02.880 --> 09:04.530
We have to protect her.

09:05.880 --> 09:07.086
I know.

09:09.040 --> 09:11.361
I'm so happy to be
back here with you.

09:12.440 --> 09:13.885
Yeah, me, too.

09:17.360 --> 09:19.249
I thought I was gonna
go crazy without you.

10:10.920 --> 10:11.921
Good to see you.

10:12.000 --> 10:13.684
Good to see you.
Thank you so much.

10:18.800 --> 10:21.485
Whoo!

10:23.920 --> 10:25.410
Look at that. Thank you.

10:26.640 --> 10:28.563
How's the Captain
taking it so far?

10:28.880 --> 10:30.723
Hasn't come out of his office.

10:30.800 --> 10:32.165
He's probably waiting for us.

10:32.240 --> 10:34.208
Well, let's not rest
on our laurels too long.

10:34.400 --> 10:37.051
- Can't we bask in our glory a little longer?
- Uh, nope.

10:37.720 --> 10:40.166
We've got work to do. We have
an attack and kidnapping...

10:40.880 --> 10:41.881
You three.

10:43.400 --> 10:44.731
My office.

10:46.280 --> 10:49.045
I'm guessing this will be
the presentation of medals.

10:55.520 --> 10:56.680
Why don't you close the door?

11:00.920 --> 11:03.241
Well, we've all made mistakes.

11:04.840 --> 11:07.684
That was one hell of an undercover
operation that we pulled off.

11:07.760 --> 11:08.896
Yeah, you looked
pretty good on TV.

11:08.920 --> 11:10.001
Yeah, well, you didn't.

11:10.840 --> 11:12.056
People really seemed to like it.

11:12.080 --> 11:13.206
I know I did.

11:13.680 --> 11:16.056
Sometimes, Captain, you have to
sacrifice for the good of the...

11:16.080 --> 11:17.081
Shut up.

11:18.120 --> 11:20.282
Let's get one thing
straight here.

11:21.000 --> 11:22.650
I'm in charge of this precinct.

11:22.920 --> 11:25.571
Any of you get out of line
again, you will be out of here.

11:26.120 --> 11:27.929
So no medals, then?

11:28.640 --> 11:29.880
Get out.

11:38.680 --> 11:41.365
Well, I don't think that was
in the spirit of reconciliation.

11:45.200 --> 11:46.486
You can get out, too.

11:47.480 --> 11:49.005
I would if I was here.

11:49.080 --> 11:51.800
You think I'm soared of you just
'cause you're... 'Cause you're dead?

11:52.520 --> 11:53.851
Is he talking to himself?

11:53.920 --> 11:55.126
Yeah, looks like it.

11:55.920 --> 11:57.160
Maybe he's on speakerphone.

11:57.240 --> 11:58.520
Aren't you worried
about the fact

11:58.560 --> 12:00.336
that you're talking to
someone who isn't even here?

12:00.360 --> 12:02.362
Oh, let's see how here
you really are.

12:02.440 --> 12:04.400
Whoa, now, wait a minute, Sean.
That's hot coffee.

12:06.160 --> 12:07.400
Well, whoever he was talking to

12:07.480 --> 12:09.050
got him hotter than his coffee.

12:10.120 --> 12:11.690
Not our problem.

12:11.760 --> 12:12.807
Let's go.

12:13.000 --> 12:14.650
Talk about coffee
going right through you.

12:15.800 --> 12:17.086
Why are you doing this?

12:17.160 --> 12:20.289
Well, my calendars pretty
open, seeing as how I'm dead.

12:20.840 --> 12:22.680
Look, if this is some kind
of revenge haunting,

12:22.760 --> 12:25.161
don't forget I shot you to
put you out of your misery.

12:25.360 --> 12:27.328
And I thank you
for that, really.

12:28.000 --> 12:30.446
But don't forget
you betrayed us all.

12:30.560 --> 12:31.760
It's the real reason I'm dead.

12:31.800 --> 12:33.768
No, I gave you an
opportunity to join me.

12:33.840 --> 12:36.525
Don't think you cleared that
with your friend Bonaparte.

12:37.120 --> 12:39.040
All right, I don't have to
listen to any of this.

12:39.760 --> 12:42.081
By the way,
Bonaparte says, "Hi."

12:45.480 --> 12:47.600
Parents were asleep when
they heard their baby crying-

12:48.000 --> 12:49.923
Mom got up
and went to the nursery

12:50.000 --> 12:52.731
to find her son, Auggie,
in the arms of a monster.

12:52.800 --> 12:54.040
She said "monster."

12:54.120 --> 12:55.565
According to
first officer on scene,

12:55.640 --> 12:58.120
she said,
quoting now, "monster."

12:58.200 --> 12:59.440
So we're thinking Wesen.

12:59.520 --> 13:00.601
Yes, we are.

13:00.800 --> 13:03.371
What else is new?

13:06.520 --> 13:07.851
Mr. and Mrs. Maler? Yes.

13:07.920 --> 13:09.696
Detective Burkhardt.
This is Detective Griffin.

13:09.720 --> 13:12.007
Thank God. Please, you
have to do something.

13:12.120 --> 13:14.168
My baby... We're doing
everything we can.

13:15.000 --> 13:16.331
First, just tell us
what happened.

13:16.920 --> 13:20.766
Um, we were asleep,
and Auggie started crying.

13:20.880 --> 13:23.360
About what time was this?
I don't know. What?

13:24.120 --> 13:26.407
We went to bed
about 10:00,10:30.

13:26.960 --> 13:28.656
I heard Auggie crying
about 1:30 in the morning.

13:28.680 --> 13:31.160
We called 911. I mean, don't
you have this information?

13:31.240 --> 13:33.049
Ma'am, please.

13:34.080 --> 13:36.367
Just walk us
through what happened.

13:36.440 --> 13:38.090
Okay, sorry.

13:39.480 --> 13:41.562
Um, like I said,
Auggie was crying.

13:42.120 --> 13:45.647
And I went up to go get him. I
thought maybe he had a fever,

13:46.200 --> 13:48.362
but when I walked into his
room there was this...

13:49.320 --> 13:52.563
This man standing over
his crib, reaching in.

13:53.960 --> 13:56.725
And when he turned around, he had
Auggie, but he wasn't a man.

13:56.800 --> 13:58.325
Haley... He wasn't a man, Paul.

13:58.440 --> 13:59.720
Haley, stop it! He wasn't a man!

14:00.160 --> 14:01.286
I know what I saw.

14:01.400 --> 14:02.400
You didn't see this, sir?

14:02.440 --> 14:03.646
It was some kind of monster.

14:03.720 --> 14:05.016
She doesn't know
what she's saying right now.

14:05.040 --> 14:06.405
With three arms and three eyes.

14:06.480 --> 14:07.561
She hither head.

14:08.280 --> 14:10.408
When I came into the nursery,
she was on the ground.

14:10.480 --> 14:12.642
She clearly hit her head,
and when she woke up,

14:12.720 --> 14:14.882
Auggie was gone, okay?
And that's what we know.

14:15.520 --> 14:17.568
So can we please find the
person who took my son?

14:17.640 --> 14:19.404
Paul, lam not making this up.

14:21.120 --> 14:23.521
Please, you have to believe me.

14:23.600 --> 14:24.726
Can you draw what you saw?

14:24.840 --> 14:26.171
Yes. Yes, I can.

14:26.600 --> 14:27.976
No, we don't have time
to be drawing...

14:28.000 --> 14:29.490
Sir, it's okay.

14:29.800 --> 14:31.211
Can you show us
where this happened?

14:31.280 --> 14:33.931
Yes, of course. It's upstairs.
This way, please.

14:37.160 --> 14:39.208
So, uh, this is where
he was taken.

14:39.680 --> 14:41.728
I found Haley
on the ground right here.

14:42.960 --> 14:46.681
Look, my wife's not thinking
straight right now,

14:47.320 --> 14:49.971
and I'm sure you guys
understand she's freaking out.

14:50.560 --> 14:51.686
We're both freaking out.

14:52.360 --> 14:54.328
She hasn't been
sleeping well, and...

14:55.320 --> 14:58.802
Listen, I love my son, all right,
but she's obsessed with him.

14:59.960 --> 15:01.336
She spends all day
glued to her phone,

15:01.360 --> 15:02.930
posting pictures
of him on the Internet.

15:03.000 --> 15:04.604
A lot of new moms
do stuff like that.

15:05.440 --> 15:08.762
Not like this. She hasn't been herself.
What she saw isn't real...

15:08.840 --> 15:10.524
Stop saying that, Paul.

15:12.280 --> 15:13.376
Just because
you don't believe me

15:13.400 --> 15:15.050
doesn't mean it didn't happen.

15:16.760 --> 15:18.888
Haley, that is not
helping us find our son.

15:22.000 --> 15:25.004
Please, you've got to
help me find my baby.

17:18.640 --> 17:21.246
He was not exaggerating
when he said Haley posts

17:21.319 --> 17:23.003
their entire lives
on the Internet.

17:23.280 --> 17:25.760
Clearly she thinks
there's no such thing as TMI.

17:25.839 --> 17:28.810
And every photo is tagged with a
location, usually their house.

17:29.200 --> 17:30.600
Could be how
our monster found them.

17:30.640 --> 17:32.961
Well, her account isn't private,
so that's a possibility.

17:33.960 --> 17:35.724
Dug through some
old case files and found

17:35.800 --> 17:37.529
three other kidnappings
with the same MO.

17:37.600 --> 17:40.649
Baby taken straight from the
cradle by a supposed monster.

17:40.720 --> 17:42.563
In Portland? Nope. All over.

17:43.280 --> 17:45.089
One in Nova Scotia
two years ago,

17:45.160 --> 17:46.844
another in Chiapas
five years ago,

17:46.960 --> 17:49.770
and the third
in Idaho Falls 18 years ago.

17:49.880 --> 17:52.486
Parents in Nova Scotia are
Trevor and Darla Shabtai.

17:53.000 --> 17:54.160
Take a look at Dad's profile.

17:57.520 --> 18:00.842
Their social media addiction
sure made them easy targets.

18:01.480 --> 18:03.323
We're gonna need some book time.

18:04.360 --> 18:05.361
Something wrong?

18:06.480 --> 18:07.891
I don't know. I...

18:08.840 --> 18:10.763
I'm lightheaded. I must
have stood up too fast.

18:13.000 --> 18:14.411
Ah!

18:37.800 --> 18:39.529
Three eyes and three arms?

18:40.080 --> 18:43.527
You sure it wasn't a one-eyed,
one-horned, flying purple people-eater?

18:44.040 --> 18:45.644
Oh, I've got one with two heads.

18:46.240 --> 18:47.890
Maybe it isn't Wesen.

18:48.600 --> 18:50.602
What, you mean
like a real monster?

18:50.920 --> 18:52.729
Please don't tell me
you think they exist.

18:52.800 --> 18:54.802
Wait. I think I found it.

19:01.160 --> 19:02.571
You don't need to see that.
Why not?

19:02.720 --> 19:03.721
You're pregnant.

19:04.080 --> 19:05.816
Oh, my God, don't tell me
it's another baby-eater.

19:05.840 --> 19:06.966
Well...

19:07.080 --> 19:10.209
"I've had the good fortune to never
encounter this Wesen personally.

19:11.000 --> 19:13.606
"However, I knew of a woman
who was not so lucky."

19:14.440 --> 19:18.240
"She was preyed upon by the savage
three-eyed, three-armed beast"

19:18.680 --> 19:20.603
"in the mountainous region
of Cantabria,"

19:21.560 --> 19:26.248
"a part of Spain where this notorious
Wesen is known as El Cuegle."

19:26.480 --> 19:28.448
Okay, so at least
we know it's Wesen.

19:28.560 --> 19:31.211
"The evil El Cuegle
stalks mothers"

19:31.280 --> 19:33.601
"and kidnaps
their newborn babes."

19:34.520 --> 19:37.729
"He keeps them for
the Hours of Dread."

19:37.800 --> 19:38.896
What are the Hours of Dread?

19:38.920 --> 19:39.921
And how many are there?

19:40.000 --> 19:43.846
I don't know. It just says,
"Until El Cuegle is certain."

19:43.920 --> 19:45.365
Certain of what?

19:45.440 --> 19:49.240
Something called
Abortar Mal Futuro.

19:49.720 --> 19:52.451
Even I hablo enough Español
to know what that means.

19:54.560 --> 19:56.449
"Abort the bad future."

19:56.680 --> 19:57.727
Abort?

19:57.840 --> 20:00.002
How does he do that if the
babies are already born?

20:00.080 --> 20:02.401
You know, he gets rid of them.

20:02.960 --> 20:04.246
You mean he eats them.

20:04.320 --> 20:05.651
Yeah, something like that.

20:06.640 --> 20:07.971
This is just wrong.

20:09.640 --> 20:12.962
And we have got to stop
this baby-eating bastard.

20:42.960 --> 20:44.450
No, no, no!

20:45.800 --> 20:46.800
Sir?

20:48.200 --> 20:49.645
Sir, are you okay?

20:50.440 --> 20:52.169
Somebody call 911, please? Sir?

20:54.120 --> 20:55.121
Oh!

21:01.200 --> 21:03.885
Nova Scotia,
Chiapas, Idaho Falls.

21:03.960 --> 21:06.884
Description of the kidnapping monster
is the same in all the cases.

21:06.960 --> 21:10.282
Then El Cuegle has broadened his
hunting ground outside of Spain.

21:10.360 --> 21:12.169
Yeah, and these are
the only cases

21:12.240 --> 21:13.600
where we have
a description of him.

21:14.640 --> 21:16.722
Could be more babies he took
without being seen.

21:16.800 --> 21:18.536
Or the ones that saw him
and didn't wanna say anything

21:18.560 --> 21:19.976
'cause they didn't
want to sound crazy.

21:20.000 --> 21:23.288
Paul wasn't exactly supportive
of Haley's side of the story.

21:23.840 --> 21:26.810
There's a lot more unsolved cases
involving abducted newborns.

21:26.880 --> 21:29.042
El Cuegle has to be responsible
for some of those.

21:29.120 --> 21:30.645
Well, how many babies
can one guy eat?

21:31.760 --> 21:33.016
Is that a real question
or a riddle?

21:33.040 --> 21:34.121
It's Wesen.

21:34.680 --> 21:36.364
Three arms, three eyes? Yup.

21:37.120 --> 21:38.849
We got a name
on this baby-munching Wesen?

21:39.080 --> 21:40.445
El Cuegle.

21:40.520 --> 21:41.576
Well, you can tell me
on the way,

21:41.600 --> 21:44.285
'cause we got a call reporting
a monster in a mini-mart.

21:45.240 --> 21:46.765
How are we gonna do this? What?

21:46.840 --> 21:47.976
Catch El Cuegle? I don't know,

21:48.000 --> 21:49.616
but Nick and Hank better
think of something,

21:49.640 --> 21:51.130
or I'm gonna go rogue
on this creep.

21:51.200 --> 21:52.247
No. Stay here in Portland.

21:52.880 --> 21:53.881
Wait. What?

21:54.920 --> 21:58.163
I mean, after everything that's
happened around Nick and us...

21:58.240 --> 22:00.322
He doesn't exactly
attract family types.

22:00.400 --> 22:03.165
I mean, he's a cop, and a Grimm.

22:03.960 --> 22:07.567
Yeah, and a close friend, but now
you and I are starting a family.

22:09.880 --> 22:11.006
No, I know.

22:11.840 --> 22:13.200
I've been thinking
about that, too.

22:13.880 --> 22:15.530
I mean, I never...
I mean, honestly,

22:15.600 --> 22:18.524
never cared about having
kids or getting married.

22:18.600 --> 22:20.284
It wasn't a priority to me.

22:20.400 --> 22:22.926
I couldn't imagine putting
anybody's needs before my own.

22:23.640 --> 22:25.005
But you changed all that.

22:25.080 --> 22:27.003
And you changed all that for me.

22:27.400 --> 22:30.768
Listen, Monroe, I am scared.

22:30.840 --> 22:35.926
I am, like, "heart racing, pit in my
stomach, can't breathe" type of scared

22:36.040 --> 22:37.485
because now that
I have everything

22:37.560 --> 22:39.005
that I never even knew I wanted,

22:39.080 --> 22:41.367
I feel like it's all going
to get taken away from me,

22:41.440 --> 22:42.441
and I can't...

22:43.560 --> 22:45.483
I will not live like this.

22:45.560 --> 22:47.210
I can't be this vulnerable
all the time.

22:47.280 --> 22:48.850
I know. I know.

22:49.480 --> 22:50.891
It's exhausting.

22:51.440 --> 22:54.080
I mean, you know that saying,
"Waiting for the other shoe to drop"?

22:54.240 --> 22:55.321
I do.

22:59.520 --> 23:01.329
It surfaced in
the late 19th century.

23:01.960 --> 23:03.336
When people started
moving to big cities

23:03.360 --> 23:04.600
and living on top of each other

23:04.640 --> 23:06.210
in these massive
apartment buildings,

23:06.320 --> 23:07.845
where night
after night after night

23:07.920 --> 23:09.410
they had this shared experience

23:09.480 --> 23:11.376
where the tenants would hear
their neighbors, like,

23:11.400 --> 23:13.243
by the thousands,
come home after work,

23:13.320 --> 23:16.164
sit down, take off one shoe,
drop it on the floor, right?

23:16.240 --> 23:18.776
Then there'd be this pause, between
the first shoe and the second,

23:18.800 --> 23:21.246
where the downstairs neighbor
would cover their ears,

23:24.560 --> 23:25.925
waiting

23:27.000 --> 23:28.684
for the other shoe to drop. Oh.

23:29.000 --> 23:31.731
Right? I mean,
we live in a world full

23:33.240 --> 23:34.520
of, you know, people with shoes.

23:35.240 --> 23:36.685
I mean, several pairs each.

23:37.200 --> 23:38.690
And so we can't go through life

23:38.760 --> 23:41.081
with our ears covered
or our eyes.

23:41.840 --> 23:44.161
We have to just be prepared

23:45.880 --> 23:48.531
for that other shoe,
no matter where we are.

23:55.200 --> 23:57.680
I just want to live in a
place without shoes, okay?

24:00.120 --> 24:02.122
You told the officer
he stole something?

24:02.200 --> 24:03.565
Infant cold medicine.

24:03.640 --> 24:04.766
There, that's him.

24:05.320 --> 24:06.760
Looks like he's in
some kind of pain.

24:07.080 --> 24:08.320
Can't really see his face.

24:08.800 --> 24:09.881
Any more cameras?

24:09.960 --> 24:11.883
No, it's just
these two on the inside

24:11.960 --> 24:13.371
and one outside
for the parking lot.

24:16.640 --> 24:18.130
You can see how freaked I was.

24:18.200 --> 24:19.770
If that was a mask,
it looked way real.

24:20.680 --> 24:23.206
I mean, I hope he wasn't a
disabled person or something.

24:23.560 --> 24:25.722
That wouldn't really
explain the third eye,

24:25.800 --> 24:29.009
but maybe he was disfigured in
a nuclear accident somewhere.

24:30.760 --> 24:32.250
Here's the parking lot stuff.

24:32.320 --> 24:33.606
There he goes.

24:42.200 --> 24:43.406
Stop it.

24:44.680 --> 24:46.045
We got a plate.

24:46.520 --> 24:48.409
It's a little blurry.
No, we can clear that.

24:48.760 --> 24:50.489
Then run it. Put out an APB.

25:48.720 --> 25:50.370
Daddy. Hey, honey.

25:50.760 --> 25:52.250
Oh, I'm so happy to see you.

25:52.360 --> 25:54.124
I missed you.
And I missed you, too.

25:54.920 --> 25:56.809
I will be ready to
pick you up tomorrow,

25:56.880 --> 25:58.769
or before if you
change your mind.

25:59.320 --> 26:01.163
I'll be okay. I love you.

26:01.560 --> 26:02.925
I love you, too.

26:04.160 --> 26:06.200
Oh, listen, there's something
you both need to know.

26:07.160 --> 26:08.286
Um, we're gonna be moving.

26:09.920 --> 26:11.001
Why?

26:11.080 --> 26:13.321
Because I'm not gonna
be the Mayor anymore.

26:15.320 --> 26:16.481
Where are you going?

26:17.320 --> 26:18.924
I'll send you the address.

26:19.000 --> 26:20.126
Okay-

26:21.400 --> 26:22.481
Bye.

26:26.880 --> 26:29.087
So what do you feel like doing?

26:29.160 --> 26:32.209
Do you wanna watch a movie,
or are you hungry?

26:32.280 --> 26:33.691
Why don't you love Mommy?

26:35.000 --> 26:36.161
Well, um...

26:37.880 --> 26:39.456
Your mommy and I just
haven't had a chance

26:39.480 --> 26:40.845
to really get to know
each other.

26:41.440 --> 26:42.566
Is it because of Nick?

26:43.760 --> 26:44.841
Yeah, it is.

26:45.920 --> 26:48.764
Mommy said you'd say so, and
that I shouldn't believe you.

26:49.560 --> 26:52.400
Well, maybe you shouldn't listen to
everything Mommy has to say, either.

26:53.000 --> 26:55.048
Mommy loves Nick.

26:56.440 --> 26:57.566
And I love you.

26:58.720 --> 27:00.324
I guess we all
love each other, then.

27:00.880 --> 27:02.644
Come on, I'm hungry. Let's go.

27:03.520 --> 27:05.727
Why Woge inside a store
just to steal some medicine.

27:06.560 --> 27:08.210
Built-in mask. Nah.

27:10.720 --> 27:12.722
He fell to the floor. Why?

27:13.760 --> 27:15.524
He didn't slip. He didn't trip.

27:15.600 --> 27:17.921
Nobody was around him.
He wasn't pushed.

27:18.360 --> 27:20.336
And he's holding his head
like it was about to explode.

27:20.360 --> 27:21.600
Okay. He had a migraine.

27:22.040 --> 27:25.806
Before he has the migraine, he takes
infant medicine off the shelf.

27:26.760 --> 27:28.125
Not adult.

27:28.400 --> 27:29.561
And it's not for migraines.

27:29.880 --> 27:32.884
Well, Paul and Haley said baby
Auggie was coming down with a fever.

27:33.360 --> 27:36.284
But why would El Cuegle take a
chance stealing baby medicine?

27:36.560 --> 27:39.166
Maybe he is keeping
Auggie healthy

27:39.240 --> 27:43.165
until, you know, he dines.

27:43.560 --> 27:46.404
Maybe. But this guy's got a car.

27:47.240 --> 27:49.527
You telling me he can't afford
10 bucks for some medicine?

27:49.600 --> 27:51.160
He's gonna risk
getting caught for that?

27:51.600 --> 27:52.761
Maybe he didn't mean to Woge.

27:53.240 --> 27:55.536
I got a feeling something's
really off with this Cuegle dude.

27:55.560 --> 27:58.166
Got a good read on the license plate.
It's a rental.

27:58.280 --> 28:01.011
Address given on the rental
contract is an apartment

28:01.080 --> 28:03.048
in Santo Domingo Pueblo,
New Mexico.

28:03.160 --> 28:04.207
I ran that address.

28:05.040 --> 28:07.771
The apartment building is owned by a Mr.
De La Torre,

28:08.360 --> 28:10.044
but Mr. De La Torre
doesn't live there.

28:10.120 --> 28:11.565
He rents the apartment out,

28:11.640 --> 28:14.086
most recently to one
Isidoro Malpica,

28:14.800 --> 28:16.609
who has a New Mexico
driver's license.

28:16.680 --> 28:19.126
Doesn't say anything about
a third eye or third arm.

28:19.200 --> 28:20.929
Makes you wonder
which hands they printed.

28:21.000 --> 28:22.968
Hold on.

28:25.840 --> 28:28.200
They've got the rental car.
Apartment building in St. Johns.

28:40.920 --> 28:43.207
Where's the car? Parking
lot of the building.

28:43.960 --> 28:45.724
Third spot from
the entrance on the right.

28:46.040 --> 28:47.166
Anyone approach the car?

28:47.240 --> 28:48.241
Not since I've been here.

28:48.320 --> 28:49.401
We know which unit it is?

28:49.480 --> 28:51.369
It's parked in the spot
for unit 64.

28:51.760 --> 28:53.888
Hey, you stay here.
We'll check it out.

28:55.800 --> 28:58.485
Confirming
the address, 3710 South...

29:13.120 --> 29:15.009
Wu, get the baby. Yeah.

29:17.000 --> 29:18.206
Baby's fine.

29:35.680 --> 29:37.409
I got three arms and two cuffs.

29:37.480 --> 29:38.640
You don't see this every day.

29:39.720 --> 29:40.960
Grimm.

29:41.320 --> 29:42.526
Settle down.

29:45.880 --> 29:47.120
That was really weird.

29:47.200 --> 29:48.247
Baby seems okay.

29:48.320 --> 29:50.243
No, no, no, you can't take him.

29:53.360 --> 29:54.805
You don't understand.

29:54.880 --> 29:56.325
You have the right
to remain silent.

29:57.200 --> 29:58.486
No! Don't take him!

29:58.560 --> 30:02.087
Anything you say or eat will be
used against you in a court of law.

30:13.520 --> 30:16.296
No, honey, you have to wait till the
water boils until you pour that in.

30:16.320 --> 30:17.481
It is.

30:18.520 --> 30:20.249
Sweetie, the stove's
not even on.

30:34.840 --> 30:36.200
It must be fun
being you, isn't it?

30:47.080 --> 30:49.520
Honey, do you know what happened
to Daddy's friend, Bonaparte?

30:49.720 --> 30:50.767
Yes.

30:52.760 --> 30:53.921
Do you want to tell me?

30:54.600 --> 30:55.806
He died.

30:56.760 --> 30:59.081
Really? Mmm-hmm.

31:00.480 --> 31:01.686
Do you know how he died?

31:03.200 --> 31:04.440
You killed him, Daddy.

31:05.080 --> 31:06.081
Did I?

31:06.440 --> 31:07.441
Uh-huh.

31:10.920 --> 31:12.001
Do you know why I did?

31:13.280 --> 31:15.965
Because he hurt Mommy.
Men shouldn't hurt mommies.

31:16.280 --> 31:17.691
That's very true.
They shouldn't.

31:29.960 --> 31:33.169
You know, honey, you don't always
have to protect everybody.

31:35.880 --> 31:37.484
You can always come to me.

31:40.200 --> 31:42.487
But if you ever do see
something when I'm not around,

31:42.960 --> 31:45.247
like, uh...

31:45.400 --> 31:49.200
Well, for example, if Nick
was ever to hurt Mommy.

31:50.000 --> 31:52.207
Oh. He'd be very sorry.

31:54.480 --> 31:55.811
Yes, he would.

31:57.120 --> 31:58.690
Oh, my God, oh, my God,
oh, my God!

31:59.400 --> 32:00.686
My baby-

32:08.920 --> 32:10.360
I can't tell you
how grateful we are.

32:10.640 --> 32:12.816
You have no idea what this means to us.
I missed you so much.

32:12.840 --> 32:14.001
Actually, I do.

32:14.360 --> 32:15.566
I have a son.

32:16.160 --> 32:17.650
How did you find that monster?

32:18.320 --> 32:20.288
Honey, it was just a man.
Give it a rest, okay?

32:20.360 --> 32:21.691
I know what I saw, Paul.

32:25.080 --> 32:28.050
Auggie is safe.
That's all that matters now.

32:30.920 --> 32:32.285
Hi, Auggie.

32:37.640 --> 32:39.051
Where's the baby?

32:41.600 --> 32:42.886
Oh, that's not how this works.

32:43.320 --> 32:44.651
We ask the questions.

32:45.240 --> 32:48.767
You can't let him live with his parents.
You don't understand.

32:49.200 --> 32:50.725
Yes, we do understand,

32:53.240 --> 32:54.241
El Cuegle.

32:55.400 --> 32:56.765
Hope that's how
you pronounce it.

32:57.120 --> 32:59.361
You may be a Grimm, but you
don't understand this.

32:59.440 --> 33:01.496
Why don't you tell us how
many kids you've kidnapped.

33:01.520 --> 33:05.411
It's complicated. It's not complicated.
It's cannibalism.

33:06.560 --> 33:09.056
If I wasn't a cop, you'd be holding
your head in your hands right now.

33:09.080 --> 33:10.127
All three of them.

33:10.200 --> 33:13.204
I don't do this because I want to.
I have to.

33:13.280 --> 33:14.850
What, you get
a headache if you don't?

33:14.920 --> 33:15.967
I get visions.

33:16.040 --> 33:17.690
And these visions
tell you to do what?

33:17.840 --> 33:18.921
Stop the evil.

33:21.400 --> 33:23.482
You Grimms think
you know El Cuegle.

33:24.680 --> 33:26.921
You don't. You never have.

33:28.480 --> 33:31.450
You don't know the horror of why
we have to do this terrible thing.

33:31.880 --> 33:34.087
If you think it's so terrible,
why don't you just stop?

33:34.440 --> 33:37.842
Because I can see
the past with one eye,

33:37.920 --> 33:39.285
and the present with the other,

33:40.400 --> 33:41.401
and the third,

33:42.400 --> 33:44.402
with that eye,
the future can be seen.

33:44.720 --> 33:47.451
So you're some Dickens character
in A Christmas Carol?

33:47.600 --> 33:49.045
I am not a monster.

33:49.120 --> 33:50.281
No, you're Wesen.

33:50.360 --> 33:54.809
My visions tell me about children
who will do monstrous things.

33:56.600 --> 33:58.364
That is why I have to take them.

34:00.360 --> 34:01.930
That is why I have to eat them.

34:02.440 --> 34:04.040
That's your reason
for kidnapping Auggie?

34:06.520 --> 34:10.002
You might want to rethink that if
you're gonna use that as your defense.

34:12.120 --> 34:14.168
When Auggie turns 19,

34:14.280 --> 34:16.043
he will do something terrible.

34:16.880 --> 34:17.960
What?

34:19.880 --> 34:22.167
His parents' marriage
will continue to fall apart.

34:23.080 --> 34:24.411
It will become violent.

34:25.800 --> 34:29.521
Auggie will grow up
isolated and unstable.

34:29.600 --> 34:31.568
That is not a crime
worthy of your punishment.

34:32.000 --> 34:34.367
On his 19th birthday,
he will murder his parents,

34:35.639 --> 34:37.130
and that is only the beginning.

34:37.199 --> 34:38.485
How do you know that?

34:41.520 --> 34:44.569
I know when the Hours of
Dread have run their course.

34:45.000 --> 34:46.842
And how many Hours
of Dread are there?

34:46.920 --> 34:48.206
They're never the same.

34:49.480 --> 34:52.085
It's never more than two
days, never less than one.

34:52.159 --> 34:53.605
So let me get this straight.

34:56.000 --> 34:57.331
You want us to let you go

34:57.400 --> 34:58.925
so you can chomp down on Auggie?

35:01.760 --> 35:03.205
That's pretty damn bold.

35:05.880 --> 35:07.211
Look up Kenneth Slater.

35:08.040 --> 35:10.168
See what happens
when I don't do what I must.

35:12.520 --> 35:13.681
Kenneth Slater.

35:15.920 --> 35:17.176
He's one of the victims
that was kidnapped

35:17.200 --> 35:18.565
on the case I was looking into.

35:21.120 --> 35:22.485
But he was returned alive.

35:22.840 --> 35:24.120
This has nothing to do with you.

35:24.520 --> 35:26.045
It has everything to do with me.

35:28.040 --> 35:29.680
You know what Kenneth did
when he grew up?

35:31.360 --> 35:32.521
What?

35:34.200 --> 35:36.726
He killed 10 innocent people
in Idaho last year.

35:38.560 --> 35:39.721
And I could have stopped him,

35:41.280 --> 35:42.520
but I was weak.

35:43.880 --> 35:46.531
I couldn't do it.
I took him back. I failed.

35:46.960 --> 35:48.371
Please, you have to let me go.

35:49.000 --> 35:51.321
I can't afford to make
the same mistake again.

35:52.440 --> 35:55.011
If you could stop Ted Bundy,
wouldn't you want me to?

35:56.600 --> 35:57.886
Please.

36:00.520 --> 36:01.760
Please.

36:06.000 --> 36:07.206
Please.

36:13.000 --> 36:16.561
Kenneth Slater. Kidnapped
in Idaho Falls 18 years ago.

36:17.440 --> 36:18.601
Missing for two days,

36:19.560 --> 36:22.086
found on his own front porch
on the third day.

36:22.200 --> 36:24.202
Baby was in good health.
Suspect never found.

36:24.280 --> 36:25.361
Look at this.

36:26.920 --> 36:29.685
Kenneth Slater was arrested
for killing 10 people

36:29.760 --> 36:32.525
in a local diner
in Idaho Falls last year.

36:33.240 --> 36:35.322
What? So El Cuegle
wants us to believe

36:35.400 --> 36:37.164
he knew Slater would
grow up to do that?

36:37.240 --> 36:38.366
That's what he's saying.

36:38.440 --> 36:39.680
He's screwing with us.

36:40.360 --> 36:41.976
He could have looked
that up in the newspaper.

36:42.000 --> 36:43.889
Unless that explains
the migraines,

36:45.000 --> 36:46.365
which could be the visions.

36:46.440 --> 36:49.603
Hank, you said something is
off with this El Cuegle dude.

36:50.320 --> 36:52.049
Maybe he is
telling us the truth.

36:52.280 --> 36:54.169
How do we find that out?
Dig deeper.

36:54.280 --> 36:56.851
See if he was anywhere near
Idaho Falls 18 years ago.

37:14.800 --> 37:17.007
Son. Son, don't do this.

37:17.640 --> 37:19.961
Auggie, please, listen, baby.

37:20.360 --> 37:21.805
Please, don't do this.

37:22.960 --> 37:24.200
We're sorry, okay?

37:26.480 --> 37:29.370
Auggie, please, baby, listen.

37:32.160 --> 37:34.128
Why are you doing this, son?

37:34.200 --> 37:35.247
Auggie, baby, listen.

37:37.760 --> 37:38.841
We're your parents.

37:38.920 --> 37:39.967
We love you.

37:40.160 --> 37:41.896
Auggie. PAUL: What do
you think you're doing?

37:41.920 --> 37:42.921
I'm your...

37:49.840 --> 37:51.171
We have a medical emergency.

37:51.240 --> 37:53.607
We need paramedics
in interrogation room two.

38:00.360 --> 38:02.362
Even if he is telling the truth,

38:03.040 --> 38:06.408
what are we supposed to do?
Let him eat... Oh, crap.

38:06.880 --> 38:11.283
We got a DUI. Idaho, 19 years ago.
Isidoro was in the state.

38:14.880 --> 38:16.041
We need to talk to him again.

38:19.680 --> 38:21.409
That doesn't look good.

38:32.880 --> 38:34.325
He's going after Auggie.

38:35.520 --> 38:37.443
My baby boy.

38:38.240 --> 38:40.481
I was so worried about you.

38:41.320 --> 38:43.163
This is the best day of my life.

38:45.440 --> 38:46.646
Haley.

38:46.760 --> 38:47.841
Yeah?

38:47.920 --> 38:48.921
Honey, I'm...

38:51.000 --> 38:52.001
I'm concerned.

38:52.520 --> 38:55.569
Paul, Auggie's back. We have
nothing to worry about.

38:55.640 --> 38:57.085
No, I'm talking about you.

38:57.160 --> 38:59.616
You're going to have to deal with
what you think happened here.

38:59.640 --> 39:01.085
With what I think happened?

39:01.600 --> 39:03.125
I need you to go
see a psychiatrist.

39:03.440 --> 39:05.283
I can't believe you.

39:05.400 --> 39:07.767
I really think that you need to...

39:13.600 --> 39:14.601
Hello.

39:15.280 --> 39:16.441
Yes, this is...

39:18.400 --> 39:19.561
Wait. What?

39:20.000 --> 39:21.286
Yes. Yes, it... What?

39:22.640 --> 39:23.846
What are we supposed to do?

39:26.200 --> 39:27.936
I'm locking all the doors
and windows right now.

39:27.960 --> 39:29.849
Paul, what... It was
Detective Burkhardt.

39:29.920 --> 39:31.684
The man who kidnapped Auggie
just broke out.

39:31.760 --> 39:33.842
Oh, my God! Oh, my God, no!

39:35.280 --> 39:36.964
Paul!

39:45.520 --> 39:48.285
No! No, please! Please, no!

39:49.040 --> 39:50.530
No!

40:30.480 --> 40:32.448
The bears...

40:33.360 --> 40:34.725
The bears...

40:51.760 --> 40:54.843
What do you think he meant, "The bears"?
What's that supposed to mean?

40:55.560 --> 40:57.642
People say a lot of weird
things when they're dying.

40:57.720 --> 40:59.006
Never heard "The bears" before.

40:59.080 --> 41:01.924
Just because you didn't see
it doesn't mean I'm wrong.

41:02.000 --> 41:03.696
Do you have any idea
what you sound like right now?

41:03.720 --> 41:05.096
Do you have any idea
what you sound like?

41:05.120 --> 41:06.856
I'm not the one telling
everybody I've seen monsters.

41:06.880 --> 41:07.881
Oh, go to hell, Paul.

41:07.960 --> 41:09.656
Haley! Haley, do not walk
away from me when...

41:09.680 --> 41:10.681
No, don't touch me!

41:10.760 --> 41:12.285
Haley, would you
listen to me for a...

41:13.160 --> 41:15.003
Paul, Auggie needs that blanket.

41:15.080 --> 41:17.208
Forget this damn blanket
and talk to me.

41:19.400 --> 41:20.686
Let's tone this down.

41:21.200 --> 41:22.856
I think you guys need to
leave our house right now.

41:22.880 --> 41:24.370
No, you need to cool it,

41:25.720 --> 41:27.360
unless you wanna leave
this house with us.

41:28.920 --> 41:31.571
Maybe you don't care if everybody
thinks my wife's crazy,

41:31.640 --> 41:32.687
but I do, okay, so...

41:32.800 --> 41:34.165
I'm not crazy.

41:34.240 --> 41:35.401
Yeah? Haley.

41:35.800 --> 41:36.961
Haley. Listen.

41:37.760 --> 41:39.600
You probably don't want
to hear this right now,

41:41.120 --> 41:43.566
but your wife is not crazy.

41:43.680 --> 41:46.331
Wow.

41:46.960 --> 41:48.724
I guess you would know, huh?

41:51.160 --> 41:52.446
- Haley.
- No, no.

41:52.520 --> 41:54.170
I am done talking with you, Paul.
Haley.

41:54.280 --> 41:55.400
I'm not done talking to you.

41:55.440 --> 41:57.841
Paul, I know what I saw.

41:57.920 --> 41:58.967
Nick.

41:59.840 --> 42:01.251
Haley, please.

42:02.120 --> 42:04.771
Oh, my God, Paul,
don't you trust me?

42:05.040 --> 42:06.724
I don't know.
You're not thinking right.

42:07.000 --> 42:09.321
Paul. Look at me. I'm not lying.

42:10.720 --> 42:12.131
The bears.

42:12.920 --> 42:15.002
Why can't you just believe me?

42:15.080 --> 42:17.686
Because, Haley,
I live in the real world.
