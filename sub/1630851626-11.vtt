WEBVTT

00:02.263 --> 00:03.829
And for some reason,
the laundry expenses

00:03.873 --> 00:05.831
for our residents have doubled
in the last few months.

00:05.875 --> 00:07.181
Soup.

00:07.224 --> 00:08.138
I'm sorry?

00:08.182 --> 00:09.748
We gotta serve less soup.

00:09.792 --> 00:11.315
Problem solved.

00:11.359 --> 00:13.752
Teamwork makes the dream work.

00:13.796 --> 00:16.407
[phone rings]

00:16.451 --> 00:17.974
Hold on a sec.
Uh-huh.

00:18.018 --> 00:19.454
Hey.GABBY: A guy named Scott

00:19.497 --> 00:21.325
is calling you.
He says he's a lawyer.

00:21.369 --> 00:24.198
Okay.He's a Leo with rising Gemini.

00:24.241 --> 00:26.591
They're supposed to be chatty,
but not this one.

00:26.635 --> 00:27.723
Put him through.

00:27.766 --> 00:30.073
I'm so sorry,
but I have to take this.

00:30.117 --> 00:32.162
Okay.

00:32.206 --> 00:34.077
Like, alone.

00:34.121 --> 00:35.861
Oh.

00:35.905 --> 00:37.602
And do you mind closing
the door on your way out?

00:37.646 --> 00:38.647
Hey.

00:38.690 --> 00:39.735
If you've got
something to hide,

00:39.778 --> 00:41.476
none of my business.

00:43.913 --> 00:44.827
Do your hands hurt?

00:44.870 --> 00:45.958
Constantly.

00:46.002 --> 00:47.221
What do you do about it?

00:47.264 --> 00:49.049
Well, I try and focus
on the part of me

00:49.092 --> 00:50.354
that doesn't hurt.

00:50.398 --> 00:52.574
Which is this area right there.

00:54.880 --> 00:55.838
May I join you?

00:55.881 --> 00:57.405
Course.

01:01.148 --> 01:03.019
Is everything okay?

01:03.063 --> 01:04.238
Not sure.

01:04.281 --> 01:05.891
Ooh, tell us, tell us.

01:05.935 --> 01:07.763
Gina was in her office

01:07.806 --> 01:08.851
with the door closed

01:08.894 --> 01:10.157
talking to a lawyer.

01:10.200 --> 01:11.288
About what?

01:11.332 --> 01:14.291
She made me leave the room.

01:15.249 --> 01:17.512
So something she didn't
want you to hear.

01:17.555 --> 01:22.343
Wow, I can see why
you were such a good cop.

01:22.386 --> 01:24.040
I heard her complaining
that running this place

01:24.084 --> 01:25.607
was tougher than she thought.

01:25.650 --> 01:27.826
Did she say she wanted to sell?

01:27.870 --> 01:28.914
No, not to me.

01:28.958 --> 01:30.568
Oh, she wouldn't
sell this place.

01:30.612 --> 01:33.136
Although you certainly have
made her life very difficult.

01:33.180 --> 01:34.224
What did I do?

01:34.268 --> 01:35.791
Demanding that English be

01:35.834 --> 01:37.488
the official language
of Valley Hills!

01:37.532 --> 01:39.229
You're the one always
bugging her about

01:39.273 --> 01:40.709
getting almond milk.

01:40.752 --> 01:44.016
If it doesn't come
from a cow, it's not milk.

01:44.060 --> 01:45.192
Then what is it?

01:45.235 --> 01:47.977
A liberal conspiracy
to poison America.

01:48.804 --> 01:51.415
Hey! What's shakin',
eggs and bacon?

01:53.765 --> 01:56.333
Am I not as adorable
as I thought?

01:56.377 --> 01:58.248
Gina, please
don't leave us.

01:58.292 --> 01:59.423
We promise we'll be better.

01:59.467 --> 02:00.511
What are you talking about?

02:00.555 --> 02:01.904
We don't have to speak English.

02:01.947 --> 02:03.862
We can habla español.

02:03.906 --> 02:05.777
And I'll drink regular milk.

02:05.821 --> 02:08.998
Apologies to those
who sit near me.

02:09.041 --> 02:11.609
These shmendricks have
gotten it into their head

02:11.653 --> 02:13.307
that you're selling
Valley Hills.

02:13.350 --> 02:15.091
You got a call
from a lawyer.

02:15.135 --> 02:17.615
[laughs]:
Oh... that.

02:17.659 --> 02:21.228
No. It's some legal trouble
from when I was younger.

02:21.271 --> 02:22.881
I'm trying to find an attorney.

02:22.925 --> 02:24.274
[relieved sighing]

02:24.318 --> 02:27.582
I told 'em it was nothing
to worry about.

Lou-uh-ville.What?

03:26.467 --> 03:28.947
You're saying it wrong.
It's... Lou-uh-ville.

03:28.991 --> 03:30.514
Louis-ville.

03:30.558 --> 03:32.821
J-Just throw it away.
Louisville.

03:32.864 --> 03:34.649
[with accent]:
Louisville! Ooh.

03:34.692 --> 03:36.346
I don't know why I did
an Italian accent there.

03:36.390 --> 03:37.391
I panicked.

03:37.434 --> 03:39.219
[alert dings]Uh-oh.

03:39.262 --> 03:41.612
The "Check Engine" light just
came on. What do we do?

03:41.656 --> 03:43.527
Well, here's a thought.
We check the engine.

03:43.571 --> 03:46.051
Oh, God! Oh, God.

03:46.095 --> 03:48.706
Oh, no! There was
a fire extinguisher in the back

03:48.750 --> 03:51.361
but I got rid of it to
make room for my K-Cups.

03:51.405 --> 03:53.537
It's just overheating.
Just pull over.

03:53.581 --> 03:56.236
Where's the hazard lights?

03:56.279 --> 03:58.150
Nope-- oh, nope.

03:58.194 --> 04:01.241
Oh, boy, I'm really doing
the wrong thing here.

04:02.459 --> 04:04.069
[knocks]Hello!

04:04.113 --> 04:06.550
Oh, hey.Looking for a lawyer?

04:06.594 --> 04:10.728
I present my son,
Kyle Morgan, attorney at law.

04:10.772 --> 04:11.686
Nice to meet you.

04:11.729 --> 04:13.514
Hi.At the risk of overstating

04:13.557 --> 04:15.559
his legal skills,
imagine Matlock

04:15.603 --> 04:17.822
rebooted with Michael B. Jordan.

04:17.866 --> 04:18.606
Dad...

04:18.649 --> 04:19.781
He also plays clarinet.

04:19.824 --> 04:20.869
Dad!

04:20.912 --> 04:23.263
You take good care of her,
Bubbaroo.

04:23.306 --> 04:25.047
[laughs]

04:25.090 --> 04:26.962
Hmm. Bubbaroo?

04:27.005 --> 04:28.572
He's called me that
since I was a baby.

04:28.616 --> 04:30.748
It's a whole thing.
There's even a song.

04:30.792 --> 04:31.836
Really?

04:31.880 --> 04:33.403
Oh, he'll sing it for you.
Just ask.

04:33.447 --> 04:35.362
I'd rather hear you play it
on your clarinet.

04:35.405 --> 04:37.755
Have a seat, Bubbaroo.

04:37.799 --> 04:40.018
So, why do you
need a lawyer?

04:40.062 --> 04:41.411
My dad didn't give me
any details.

04:41.455 --> 04:43.674
Oh, it's embarrassing.

04:43.718 --> 04:45.415
Tell me, I won't judge.

04:45.459 --> 04:47.287
Okay...

04:47.330 --> 04:50.942
a few years ago I got busted
for selling fake IDs to kids.

04:50.986 --> 04:52.770
Not that bad.Then I missed my court date.

04:52.814 --> 04:54.424
Okay.Then I paid the fine
with a phony check.

04:54.468 --> 04:56.426
All right.Then I stole the identity

04:56.470 --> 04:58.515
of a woman who died in 1951.

04:59.168 --> 05:02.127
Kind of feels like you're
judging me, Bubbaroo.

05:02.171 --> 05:03.128
Little bit.

05:03.172 --> 05:04.391
I promise

05:04.434 --> 05:05.783
I am a completely
different person now.

05:05.827 --> 05:08.612
You know that all criminals
say that, right?

05:08.656 --> 05:12.007
I've got a friend at the
DA's office, let me get into it.

05:12.050 --> 05:15.315
Okay.In the meantime, if you need me.

05:15.358 --> 05:17.229
Thank you. Oh, oh!

05:17.273 --> 05:18.753
I knew you looked familiar.

05:18.796 --> 05:20.755
I've seen your ads on
buses and billboards.

05:20.798 --> 05:22.974
"If you've gotta go to trial,
call Kyle."

05:23.018 --> 05:24.149
"I'll get you off!"

05:24.193 --> 05:25.368
Didn't hear the double meaning

05:25.412 --> 05:26.674
till it was too late.

05:27.414 --> 05:29.503
Well, I love it.

05:29.546 --> 05:31.983
I sat on your face
at a bus stop.

05:34.464 --> 05:35.552
[sportscaster speaking
indistinctly]

05:35.596 --> 05:37.075
Ah!Oh!

05:37.119 --> 05:39.121
Fourth and three with less
than two minutes left

05:39.164 --> 05:40.731
and you're gonna punt?

05:40.775 --> 05:43.778
They deserve to lose. How is he
still their head coach?

05:43.821 --> 05:45.823
I mean, they can't stop
the double-A gap blitz;

05:45.867 --> 05:48.043
of course
they're gonna punt.

05:48.086 --> 05:49.653
You know football?

05:49.697 --> 05:51.263
Yeah, I played in college.

05:51.307 --> 05:53.048
You did? What position?

05:53.091 --> 05:54.136
Seated.

05:55.746 --> 05:58.967
I played Madden.
It's a video game.

05:59.707 --> 06:01.665
I was almost impressed with you.

06:02.449 --> 06:04.712
Norma, I have some
ibuprofen for you.

06:04.755 --> 06:08.106
You better have something
stronger. My hip is killing me.

06:08.150 --> 06:09.673
Uh, how about an ice pack?

06:09.717 --> 06:11.501
Uh, how about this?

06:11.545 --> 06:12.676
What are you doing?

06:12.720 --> 06:15.679
Flipping you off with arthritis.

06:16.376 --> 06:18.378
If I was
controlling that guy,

06:18.421 --> 06:20.597
I'd call
a run-pass option,

06:20.641 --> 06:24.558
roll out left
and then hit the C button.

06:25.428 --> 06:28.953
I don't know whether to buy you
a beer or give you a wedgie.

06:30.085 --> 06:34.481
Of course it's a word.
It's the past tense for "twit."

06:34.524 --> 06:36.265
Hello, everyone.Hey, Bette.

06:36.308 --> 06:37.484
Spencer.

06:37.527 --> 06:38.572
Hello.

06:38.615 --> 06:39.573
How have you been?

06:39.616 --> 06:41.096
Oh, good, thanks.

06:42.967 --> 06:45.056
You know, I-I think I gotta go.

06:45.100 --> 06:48.408
I got to call a guy about
a thing I need him to do

06:48.451 --> 06:50.671
for me over in the room here...

06:51.933 --> 06:55.197
There's no guy.
His Metamucil kicked in.

06:56.633 --> 06:58.592
Ever since our date,
he's been avoiding me.

06:58.635 --> 07:00.507
Has he said anything?

07:00.550 --> 07:03.161
He might have.
I try not to listen.

07:03.205 --> 07:05.990
I don't understand. No man
has ever rejected me like this.

07:06.774 --> 07:08.732
Norma, how do you handle it?

07:13.607 --> 07:15.696
Uh, water pump's shot.

07:15.739 --> 07:18.046
We know. That's
why we're here.

07:18.089 --> 07:21.571
And we appreciate everything
that you're doing...

07:21.615 --> 07:23.921
Roy.Roy. Right.

07:23.965 --> 07:25.793
Is that your dog outside, Roy?

07:25.836 --> 07:28.448
What a cutie, even
without teeth.

07:28.491 --> 07:31.712
And just the one eye there.

07:31.755 --> 07:34.497
Parts and labor, it's gonna
run you around two grand.

07:34.541 --> 07:38.109
[sighs, whoops]

07:38.153 --> 07:41.809
Stinky. Um, two large.

07:41.852 --> 07:43.375
Ugh. Not you, the cost.

07:43.419 --> 07:46.074
You are actually quite svelte.

07:46.117 --> 07:49.294
What do you do, what are we,
in SoulCycle? Peloton?

07:49.338 --> 07:50.687
We're leaving.What?

07:50.731 --> 07:52.602
Come on. We can do it ourselves.

07:52.646 --> 07:55.126
We passed an auto parts store
on our way here.

07:55.170 --> 07:56.737
Can you give us a second,
please?

07:56.780 --> 07:59.783
Sure. I'll be on my Peloton.

07:59.827 --> 08:03.526
[laughs]:
Oh, yes, right, from earlier.

08:03.570 --> 08:05.920
Um, what are you doing?

08:05.963 --> 08:07.312
I don't know
how to fix an engine.

08:07.356 --> 08:09.837
You don't say. Let's go.

08:09.880 --> 08:12.361
No, look, look,
I know it's expensive,

08:12.404 --> 08:13.971
but I got a good feeling
about Roy.

08:14.015 --> 08:15.451
I mean, they wouldn't make
his garage the post office

08:15.495 --> 08:17.714
if he wasn't
a stand-up guy.

08:17.758 --> 08:21.196
I'm telling you,
we can do it ourselves.

08:22.197 --> 08:23.981
Fine.

08:24.852 --> 08:28.986
Roy, uh, we're gonna pass
on the water pump,

08:29.030 --> 08:32.729
but I will take two books
of Forever stamps.

08:35.689 --> 08:36.646
[knocking]

08:36.690 --> 08:38.213
Who is it?Kyle!

08:38.256 --> 08:39.519
[gasps] Damn it.

08:39.562 --> 08:42.609
Peter's son, the lawyer?

08:42.652 --> 08:44.654
One minute!

08:49.572 --> 08:51.574
[clears throat]
Come in!

08:51.618 --> 08:53.489
Hey.One sec. I'm just

08:53.533 --> 08:57.232
finishing up some important
work things. [clears throat]

08:57.275 --> 09:00.191
Approved, approved.

09:00.235 --> 09:01.889
Denied.

09:02.629 --> 09:04.674
[sighs]
What's up?

09:04.718 --> 09:05.936
I'm here to see my dad,

09:05.980 --> 09:08.069
and I got some good news
about your case.

09:08.112 --> 09:11.681
Wow, no lawyer has ever
said that to me.

09:11.725 --> 09:13.683
Talked to my buddy
at the DA's office.

09:13.727 --> 09:14.945
You're looking at a fine

09:14.989 --> 09:17.557
and 30 hours
of community service.

09:17.600 --> 09:19.428
That's so great.

09:19.471 --> 09:20.690
Thank you so much.

09:20.734 --> 09:22.692
It was nothing.
You should see

09:22.736 --> 09:24.259
some of the people I represent.

09:24.302 --> 09:25.869
Hey, what do I owe you?

09:25.913 --> 09:27.697
Don't worry about it. I just
made a few of phone calls.

09:27.741 --> 09:29.830
No, that's crazy.

09:29.873 --> 09:32.702
Look, you are so great
with my dad.

09:33.573 --> 09:35.009
Let's just call it even.Come on.

09:35.052 --> 09:36.314
I insist.

09:36.358 --> 09:37.925
All right, how about this?

09:37.968 --> 09:41.102
You take me out
for a nice dinner.

09:41.145 --> 09:43.234
Oh. Dinner.

09:43.278 --> 09:45.715
Or not. I don't want to
put you on the spot.

09:45.759 --> 09:48.413
No, um, I would like that.

09:48.457 --> 09:50.372
How's Friday?Great.

09:50.415 --> 09:51.852
See you then.

09:51.895 --> 09:53.593
Okay. I'd walk
you out, but...

09:53.636 --> 09:56.683
I'm pretty busy here.

10:00.469 --> 10:04.168
The next thing we need to do
is remove the cooling fan.

10:04.212 --> 10:05.909
You know,
if I were Harry Potter,

10:05.953 --> 10:08.259
I would just say
"Remov-io Fan-io."

10:08.303 --> 10:09.870
[laughs]

10:09.913 --> 10:11.611
You know, this is your van.
You should learn how to do this.

10:11.654 --> 10:12.655
Why?

10:12.699 --> 10:13.700
I can just hire someone

10:13.743 --> 10:14.875
who knows what they're doing.

10:14.918 --> 10:16.659
I mean,
I don't cut my own hair.

10:16.703 --> 10:19.314
Yeah, whoever cuts your hair
doesn't know what they're doing.

10:20.532 --> 10:22.665
Someday you'll wish
you'd learned how to,

10:22.709 --> 10:24.624
how to take a--Oh...

10:24.667 --> 10:25.625
Oh, damn it.

10:25.668 --> 10:26.626
You okay?

10:26.669 --> 10:28.453
No, it's my back.

10:28.497 --> 10:31.108
Okay, well, sit down.[groans]

10:31.152 --> 10:31.979
What happened?

10:32.022 --> 10:33.633
It's an old sports injury.

10:33.676 --> 10:35.635
You wouldn't understand.

10:36.461 --> 10:38.289
Is there anything I can do?

10:38.333 --> 10:40.509
I just need to rest.

10:40.552 --> 10:42.685
[exhales]
You'll have to take over.

10:42.729 --> 10:45.688
What? No.Come on.

10:45.732 --> 10:47.472
I'll talk you through it.Oh, come on.

10:47.516 --> 10:50.693
I'll just mess it up. Let's
just take it back to the garage.

10:50.737 --> 10:52.956
Okay. Okay.
You just have to

10:53.000 --> 10:55.002
put the engine back together.

10:57.439 --> 10:59.397
Check and mate.

11:00.224 --> 11:02.313
Okay, well, let me
at least put on an apron.

11:02.357 --> 11:04.315
My Tide stick
is down to the nub.

11:07.492 --> 11:09.016
Ow. Gabby,

11:09.059 --> 11:11.018
what do you know
about CBD oil?

11:11.061 --> 11:14.151
Save your money.
It doesn't get you high.

11:14.195 --> 11:15.805
Hi.

11:15.849 --> 11:17.328
Peter's son was looking for you.

11:17.372 --> 11:20.767
Oh, yeah, we were just in
my office. He got me off!

11:20.810 --> 11:22.986
Isn't it way
hotter at work?

11:23.030 --> 11:27.861
Not that. Although he
did ask me to dinner.

11:27.904 --> 11:31.647
Oh, I thought you were
giving up dating for a while.

11:31.691 --> 11:34.476
I know. I am. I was.

11:34.519 --> 11:36.173
Oh, he's so cute.

11:37.522 --> 11:38.915
What about Drew?

11:38.959 --> 11:41.004
Oh, well, Drew's off
living his van life.

11:41.048 --> 11:43.006
And he already slept
with some rando.

11:43.050 --> 11:47.663
And he should because
we are not a thing.

11:47.707 --> 11:49.839
We never were, we never will be.

11:49.883 --> 11:51.754
Friends, yes.

11:51.798 --> 11:54.714
Maybe one drunken kiss,
but that's it.

11:54.757 --> 11:56.672
Over and out.
[imitates static]

11:56.716 --> 11:58.500
Done and done.

12:00.632 --> 12:01.764
Interesting.

12:01.808 --> 12:02.765
Very.

12:02.809 --> 12:04.941
It's not interesting!

12:04.985 --> 12:07.248
Oh, hey, Peter.

12:07.291 --> 12:08.989
Oh, hello. Hey,

12:09.032 --> 12:11.818
Kyle tells me that your
legal woes are no more.

12:11.861 --> 12:13.863
Oh, he did a great job.

12:13.907 --> 12:15.212
I'm gonna take him to dinner
to thank him.

12:15.256 --> 12:17.562
Wonderful. Will Holly
be joining you?

12:17.606 --> 12:18.825
Holly?

12:18.868 --> 12:21.479
Kyle's wife. She's an angel.

12:21.523 --> 12:23.655
He's married?Yes.

12:23.699 --> 12:24.961
She teaches kindergarten--

12:25.005 --> 12:27.790
a time of wonder
and exploration.

12:27.834 --> 12:29.270
And also lice.

12:36.277 --> 12:36.930
Hey.

12:36.973 --> 12:38.018
Hey, close the door.

12:38.061 --> 12:39.802
No, with you inside.

12:39.846 --> 12:41.935
Oh, fun.

12:42.805 --> 12:44.198
Kyle is married.

12:44.241 --> 12:46.722
What?Yes, to a kindergarten teacher.

12:46.766 --> 12:47.941
Peter told me.

12:47.984 --> 12:49.725
How could he ask me out
on a date?

12:49.769 --> 12:51.031
Guys are the worst!

12:51.074 --> 12:52.597
I am gonna call
him on it.

12:52.641 --> 12:55.557
Who would cheat
on a kindergarten teacher?

12:55.600 --> 12:56.950
That poor woman.

12:56.993 --> 12:58.821
Not being smart enough
to teach grade school,

12:58.865 --> 13:01.302
and now this.

13:02.607 --> 13:04.392
[phone ringing]

13:04.435 --> 13:06.916
Hey, I'm on my way to the
courthouse so I might lose you.

13:06.960 --> 13:08.004
What's up?

13:08.048 --> 13:10.398
Oh, there is a lot up, Kyle.

13:10.441 --> 13:12.008
There is a lot up.

13:12.922 --> 13:14.097
What?

13:14.141 --> 13:15.969
How dare you ask me out.
You are married.

13:16.012 --> 13:17.840
No, I'm not.Oh, please.

13:17.884 --> 13:20.277
Your dad told me
all about Holly.

13:20.321 --> 13:22.845
We're gonna send you her head
in a box!

13:22.889 --> 13:24.151
What? No.

13:24.194 --> 13:25.848
We are-- no,
we are not gonna do that.

13:25.892 --> 13:27.328
We are definitely
not doing that.

13:28.068 --> 13:30.374
Holly and I divorced
three years ago.

13:30.418 --> 13:32.159
Oh.

13:33.421 --> 13:39.166
Oh. Your dad
still thinks you're married.

13:39.209 --> 13:40.602
Damn.

13:40.645 --> 13:42.996
His memory's gotten worse over
the last few years,

13:43.039 --> 13:45.259
but this is scary.Yeah.

13:45.302 --> 13:48.044
We see this here all the time.

13:48.958 --> 13:53.441
There's some things we can do
to help make his life easier.

13:53.484 --> 13:54.790
Thank you.

13:54.834 --> 13:56.531
I can talk to him if you'd like.

13:56.574 --> 13:58.054
That would be great.

13:58.098 --> 14:00.752
Okay. I'll let you know
what I find out.

14:00.796 --> 14:02.189
Please do.

14:05.192 --> 14:08.543
Peter forgot his son
is divorced.

14:08.586 --> 14:10.197
That's not good.

14:10.240 --> 14:11.676
Poor guy.

14:11.720 --> 14:12.939
Bright side--

14:12.982 --> 14:15.202
Kyle's single!

14:17.508 --> 14:20.468
Okay, next thing, before
you take out the water pump,

14:20.511 --> 14:22.339
you've gotta remove
the mounting bolts.

14:22.383 --> 14:25.255
You mean the things that look
like Frankenstein's neck?

14:25.299 --> 14:27.344
Yes, just like the hose clamp

14:27.388 --> 14:29.172
looked like
a friendship bracelet.

14:29.216 --> 14:30.565
Tell me it doesn't.

14:33.133 --> 14:34.830
Which way do I turn
this thing again?

14:34.874 --> 14:37.877
[groans]
Righty tighty, lefty loosey.

14:37.920 --> 14:39.791
See, that doesn't
make sense to me

14:39.835 --> 14:41.141
because the first half rhymes,

14:41.184 --> 14:42.533
and the second half
is alliterative.

14:42.577 --> 14:44.361
I mean, how is anyone
gonna remember that?

14:44.405 --> 14:46.015
[groans]

14:46.059 --> 14:48.191
[grunts] It won't move.

14:48.235 --> 14:49.497
Put some muscle into it.

14:49.540 --> 14:51.542
Oh, damn it!

14:51.586 --> 14:53.893
See, I told you
I was no good at this.

14:53.936 --> 14:55.024
You can learn.

14:55.068 --> 14:56.591
No, I can't.

14:56.634 --> 14:58.332
My dad always wanted me
to help him in the garage,

14:58.375 --> 15:00.595
but I was always too clumsy,
too slow,

15:00.638 --> 15:01.944
too weak.

15:01.988 --> 15:03.119
"You gonna dry those tears
with your skirt,

15:03.163 --> 15:05.252
Drew Barrymore?"

15:05.948 --> 15:07.950
We should've just
paid Roy to fix it.

15:07.994 --> 15:11.258
Drew, trust me, you can do this.

15:14.087 --> 15:15.436
Fine.

15:15.479 --> 15:18.656
Good. There you go.

15:18.700 --> 15:20.049
Use some elbow grease on it.

15:20.093 --> 15:23.183
Now you tell me.
Where's the elbow grease?

15:26.490 --> 15:27.970
Hey.Hey.

15:28.014 --> 15:29.711
Can we talk for a second?

15:29.754 --> 15:34.107
Certainly. These characters are
waiting for Godot; so shall I.

15:35.325 --> 15:36.674
Um...

15:37.937 --> 15:39.634
You mentioned that

15:39.677 --> 15:42.550
Kyle was married to a woman
named Holly.

15:42.593 --> 15:45.466
Lovely woman.
What about her?

15:46.815 --> 15:48.251
Well, I talked to Kyle

15:48.295 --> 15:52.125
and he said they got a divorce
a couple years ago.

15:53.561 --> 15:57.782
A-Absolutely correct.
Yes, years ago.

15:57.826 --> 15:58.914
Tragic.

15:58.958 --> 16:00.307
Peter?Hmm?

16:01.786 --> 16:04.964
You kind of made it seem
like they were still together.

16:05.007 --> 16:07.488
[stammers]
There must have been some

16:07.531 --> 16:11.013
miscommunication because
they did indeed get divorced.

16:12.058 --> 16:15.975
There are things that we can do
to help you with your memory.

16:16.018 --> 16:17.237
I don't need help!

16:17.280 --> 16:18.803
If my memory were so bad,

16:18.847 --> 16:21.284
would I remember that
your birthday is April 5th?

16:21.328 --> 16:23.373
Or that Harry played

16:23.417 --> 16:25.114
college baseball
for Wisconsin?

16:25.158 --> 16:28.378
Or that Bette made out
with Gene Simmons in an IHOP?

16:28.422 --> 16:30.511
I just want to make sure
you're okay.

16:30.554 --> 16:32.556
You mean that I'm not
a feeble old man

16:32.600 --> 16:35.255
who can't button up
his own pants!

16:35.298 --> 16:37.213
That's what you mean!

16:41.696 --> 16:43.132
Can we talk for a minute?

16:43.176 --> 16:44.699
Yeah. Sure.

16:44.742 --> 16:47.136
What's going on? Why
are you avoiding me?

16:47.180 --> 16:49.486
W-W-What are you
talking about?

16:49.530 --> 16:51.184
Well, I thought we had
a good time on our date.

16:51.227 --> 16:53.925
But now every time I go
into a room, you leave.

16:53.969 --> 16:56.276
That's just a coincidence.

16:56.319 --> 16:58.104
You walked out
of a bowl game.

16:58.147 --> 17:00.193
There was a woman referee.

17:00.236 --> 17:02.325
I could no longer
trust the outcome.

17:02.369 --> 17:04.066
Spencer.

17:06.547 --> 17:08.288
All right.

17:09.158 --> 17:13.510
Actually,
I had a great time, too.

17:13.554 --> 17:16.948
You're sweet, you're fun,
you're sexy as hell.

17:16.992 --> 17:19.212
I know all this,
cut to the chase.

17:20.387 --> 17:24.173
The truth is I haven't...

17:24.217 --> 17:30.353
you know, been with anybody else
since my wife died.

17:30.397 --> 17:32.138
Oh.

17:32.181 --> 17:37.099
When you kissed me,
I guess I sort of freaked out.

17:37.143 --> 17:39.536
Well, why didn't
you tell me that?

17:39.580 --> 17:41.364
It's embarrassing.

17:41.408 --> 17:43.149
"I'm sad about my dead wife."

17:43.192 --> 17:45.716
It's not much of a turn-on.

17:45.760 --> 17:47.066
It's cute that I
make you nervous.

17:47.109 --> 17:49.111
You really do.

17:49.155 --> 17:52.027
I just wondered if maybe

17:52.071 --> 17:55.030
we couldn't slow it down
a little bit.

17:55.074 --> 17:58.077
You mean like hand stuff?

18:02.081 --> 18:07.173
I mean, like maybe we go out
to a movie or just hang out.

18:07.216 --> 18:12.265
Get to know each other a little
better. Then see where it goes.

18:12.308 --> 18:15.659
Mm, that'd be nice.

18:17.618 --> 18:20.577
I hate that I'm turning myself
into your gal pal.

18:20.621 --> 18:23.798
Hopefully our periods
don't start to sync up.

18:23.841 --> 18:27.628
I don't think that's gonna be
a problem for either of us.

18:32.981 --> 18:34.243
All right.

18:34.287 --> 18:36.593
Now screw on the cap

18:36.637 --> 18:38.639
and start 'er up.

18:38.682 --> 18:40.902
Righty tighty.

18:40.945 --> 18:44.427
And then in my version,
it would be "lefty incorrect-y."

18:44.471 --> 18:46.429
Start the damn thing.

18:48.127 --> 18:49.650
[engine starts]

18:49.693 --> 18:51.130
[chuckles]

18:51.173 --> 18:52.261
The "Check Engine" light
is off.

18:52.305 --> 18:53.567
And it's not smoking!

18:53.610 --> 18:55.960
[laughs]:
Oh, my God. I did it.

18:56.004 --> 18:57.440
I did it!

18:57.484 --> 18:58.702
Attaboy!

18:59.703 --> 19:01.140
You did it.

19:01.183 --> 19:02.402
Wait, what about your back?

19:02.445 --> 19:04.839
I'm feeling a lot better.

19:04.882 --> 19:08.277
You son of a so-and-so.
You were faking it.

19:08.321 --> 19:10.366
Yeah, but you fixed the van,
didn't ya?

19:10.410 --> 19:11.541
Because you believed in me.

19:11.585 --> 19:13.543
In spite of my best instincts.

19:14.849 --> 19:15.806
I'm proud of you.

19:15.850 --> 19:18.766
It does feel pretty good.Mm-hmm.

19:18.809 --> 19:20.376
So, what do you say?

19:20.420 --> 19:22.030
Am I a car guy now?

19:22.073 --> 19:24.206
[yelps]:
Oh!

19:24.250 --> 19:26.382
No. No, you're not.

19:33.868 --> 19:35.913
Hey, Peter! It's Gina!

19:35.957 --> 19:39.439
I brought you some apology
oatmeal raisin cookies.

19:39.482 --> 19:42.093
The raisins represent
forgiveness,

19:42.137 --> 19:45.706
'cause they're grapes
with a second chance.

19:47.925 --> 19:49.623
Peter?

19:50.972 --> 19:52.756
Peter?

19:53.931 --> 19:55.585
[beeps]

20:12.080 --> 20:14.082
[quietly]:Oh...
