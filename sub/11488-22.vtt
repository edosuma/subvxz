00:04.420 --> 00:06.870
Thank you for transporting me home.

00:06.870 --> 00:11.790
You're a terrific cab driver and I hope someday to visit your country.

00:15.040 --> 00:16.980
Damn,where is that key?

00:16.980 --> 00:19.770
Here,key-key-key-key- key-key-key-key.

00:19.770 --> 00:21.560
Key-key-key-key.

00:24.420 --> 00:27.090
Hello,key.

00:33.300 --> 00:34.960
oh,no...

00:34.960 --> 00:37.410
wrong housE.

00:37.870 --> 00:40.630
I'm lost!

00:41.930 --> 00:44.210
Hello?

00:44.210 --> 00:45.230
Hi,alan.

00:45.230 --> 00:47.560
Come on in.

00:48.500 --> 00:50.500
Um,why don't you come in here?

00:50.500 --> 00:54.080
I can'T.I lost my key.

00:54.520 --> 00:57.060
Dah!

01:01.140 --> 01:03.630
Had a few cocktails,did we?

01:03.630 --> 01:05.340
Me,too.

01:05.340 --> 01:07.410
Listen,I need to ask you a favor.

01:07.410 --> 01:08.850
Your needs,your needs.

01:08.850 --> 01:11.920
What about my needs?

01:11.920 --> 01:14.680
Are you capable of having a conversation?

01:14.680 --> 01:16.160
Capable?

01:16.160 --> 01:22.970
I just spent 20 minutes discussing open-toed shoes with a fat man from rangoon.

01:23.600 --> 01:26.690
He's a rangooni.

01:26.690 --> 01:27.680
We'll talk in the morning.

01:27.680 --> 01:30.070
I wouldn't count on it.

01:30.070 --> 01:32.180
Go ahead.You talk,I'll cook.

01:32.180 --> 01:33.940
It's 11:30.What are you cooking?

01:33.940 --> 01:35.030
Good question.

01:35.030 --> 01:37.320
And I can give you the answer in two words: 

01:37.320 --> 01:40.700
My famous homemade chili.

01:40.700 --> 01:42.700
Since when do you make chili?

01:42.700 --> 01:45.120
There's a lot you don't know about me,alan.

01:48.190 --> 01:50.960
I am man of many layers.

01:50.960 --> 01:52.580
Strata,if you will.

01:52.580 --> 01:53.640
I see.

01:53.640 --> 01:58.640
A thin crust,magma and a chewy nougat center.

01:59.210 --> 02:03.430
Okay,uh,anyway,tomorrow I have to go to the dmv to get my license renewed.

02:03.430 --> 02:05.460
Ah,cars.

02:05.460 --> 02:07.750
Where would we be without cars?

02:07.750 --> 02:10.440
And how do we get there?

02:11.280 --> 02:14.610
Run,run,you're free!

02:15.060 --> 02:21.000
Well,listen,the thing is I can't take jake because he's got a book report to do.

02:21.000 --> 02:23.310
I love jake.

02:23.310 --> 02:26.140
Well,that's good,but will you help him with his report?

02:26.140 --> 02:28.600
I would like nothing better.

02:28.600 --> 02:29.600
You want chili?

02:29.600 --> 02:30.690
Uh,no,no,I'm good.

02:30.690 --> 02:34.010
But just so we're clear,you'll help jake?

02:34.010 --> 02:36.210
I love jake.

02:36.210 --> 02:37.610
Charlie,it's very important that...

02:37.610 --> 02:43.060
relax,I'll take jake to the dmv to get his license.

02:43.510 --> 02:46.820
Book report.

02:46.820 --> 02:48.650
Beans.

02:59.200 --> 03:01.370
I'm matt oh,no!

03:01.370 --> 03:04.530
Charlie's blackout chili.

03:06.180 --> 03:07.560
It's delicious.

03:07.560 --> 03:09.310
No argument there.

03:09.310 --> 03:11.340
Why is it called "blackout chili"?

03:11.340 --> 03:17.190
Well,sweetheart,sometimes when people drink,the do things they wouldn't normally do.

03:17.190 --> 03:22.780
Me,I like to walk into a biker bar and take a swing at the biggest chick there.

03:23.500 --> 03:27.440
Your uncle charlie,on the other hand,makes chili.

03:27.440 --> 03:29.450
But what's the blackout part?

03:29.450 --> 03:34.080
Ah,geez,jake,how many times have I told you not to crap up my kitchen?

03:34.080 --> 03:36.140
I'm not the one who...

03:36.140 --> 03:38.290
oh.

03:38.290 --> 03:43.320
Still,it beats waking up to find pool chalk between your fanny cheeks.

03:46.100 --> 03:47.490
Where's your father?

03:47.490 --> 03:48.740
He went to the dmv.

03:48.740 --> 03:51.240
He said you promised to help me with my book report.

03:51.240 --> 03:53.900
Really?That doesn't sound like me.

03:53.900 --> 03:56.300
I didn't think so either,but that's what he said.

03:56.300 --> 03:57.220
When's it due?

03:57.220 --> 03:58.100
Monday.

03:58.100 --> 03:58.720
Okay.

03:58.720 --> 04:01.120
Today's saturday?

04:01.160 --> 04:02.890
We got plenty of time.

04:02.890 --> 04:05.240
Yeah,but my dad always says if I do my work early,

04:05.240 --> 04:07.660
then I have the rest of the weekend to have fun.

04:07.660 --> 04:10.550
That makes no sense whatsoever.

04:10.550 --> 04:12.700
That's what I said.

04:13.430 --> 04:14.640
Let me ask you something.

04:14.640 --> 04:15.870
Do you want to do it now?

04:15.870 --> 04:16.649
No.

04:16.649 --> 04:19.200
Then trust your instincts.

04:19.200 --> 04:20.820
Here's what you do.

04:20.820 --> 04:22.690
You go out and have a good time,

04:22.690 --> 04:25.610
let the report percolate in your subconscious.

04:25.610 --> 04:30.310
Then,as the deadline approaches and that flop-sweat panic hits,

04:30.310 --> 04:34.890
those pages will come shooting out of you like a lunch from a supermodel.

04:35.800 --> 04:37.100
Well,I do like to percolate.

04:37.100 --> 04:39.520
That a boy.

04:39.520 --> 04:41.790
What are you doing today?

04:41.790 --> 04:44.630
Well,I've got to write a new jingle for a big credit card company 

04:44.630 --> 04:47.400
and they're expecting it on monday,so...

04:47.400 --> 04:50.040
I'm going to the track.

04:50.330 --> 04:55.020
Now serving number 38 at window "D.

04:56.220 --> 04:58.850
I got 42.

04:58.850 --> 05:01.200
I made an appointment.

05:01.200 --> 05:03.770
Good for you.

05:06.480 --> 05:09.090
What's your number?

05:09.680 --> 05:11.050
I'm 97.

05:11.050 --> 05:12.410
Ouch.

05:12.410 --> 05:15.190
You're gonna be here forever.

05:16.560 --> 05:19.240
Yeah.

05:20.300 --> 05:22.450
Oh,hey,you know what?

05:22.450 --> 05:24.930
I'm probably not even going to need this power bar.

05:24.930 --> 05:26.640
You want it?

05:26.640 --> 05:28.270
Thanks.

05:28.270 --> 05:31.120
You're very kind.

05:31.630 --> 05:34.460
Next time,plan ahead.

05:34.460 --> 05:35.790
Will do.

05:35.790 --> 05:37.360
Got to know how to work the system.

05:37.360 --> 05:38.430
Again...

05:38.430 --> 05:41.600
thanks.

05:42.700 --> 05:44.510
Okay,I'm leaving.

05:44.510 --> 05:45.500
Bye.

05:45.500 --> 05:47.300
If you need anything,ask berta.

05:47.300 --> 05:48.150
Okay.

05:48.150 --> 05:51.450
She won't give it to you,but she enjoys being asked.

05:59.230 --> 06:01.010
Turn that off.You're coming with me.

06:01.010 --> 06:02.370
Really?To the track?

06:02.370 --> 06:05.430
It's got to be better for you than tv.

06:07.070 --> 06:08.040
Are we gonna gamble?

06:08.040 --> 06:10.300
No,suckers gamble.

06:10.300 --> 06:13.230
We're gonna analyze statistics with proven scientific principles 

06:13.230 --> 06:17.200
and make wagers based on the result of data.

06:18.880 --> 06:20.860
I think I'd rather watch tv.

06:20.860 --> 06:21.500
Come on.

06:21.500 --> 06:23.400
Come on.

06:23.400 --> 06:27.120
Now serving number 39 at window "A.

06:27.120 --> 06:30.540
It appears my time on your planet is almost over.

06:33.280 --> 06:34.960
excuse me.Are you done with your paper?

06:34.960 --> 06:36.340
Oh,sure.

06:36.340 --> 06:37.320
Here.

06:37.320 --> 06:38.660
Thank you.

06:39.000 --> 06:41.870
I didn't even have a chance to finish the jumble.

06:41.870 --> 06:43.180
Well,I'll have time.

06:43.180 --> 06:44.150
Ooh.

06:44.150 --> 06:46.910
Hey,97,that ought to lift your spirits.

06:46.910 --> 06:49.560
I'm ebullient.

06:50.650 --> 06:51.920
I feel like such an idiot.

06:51.920 --> 06:54.060
I didn't even know you could make an appointment.

06:54.060 --> 06:56.360
Well,most people don'T.

06:56.360 --> 06:59.170
Am I right?

07:00.870 --> 07:02.050
Lena.

07:02.050 --> 07:04.280
Oh,uh,I'm-I'm alan.

07:04.280 --> 07:07.570
Ooh,you have a firm handshake,alan.

07:07.570 --> 07:08.920
I like that in a man.

07:08.920 --> 07:12.590
Well,I'm a,I'm a chiropractor and my hands are my instruments.

07:12.590 --> 07:17.220
And I also carry a little squishy ball in my pocket to head off carpal tunnel.

07:17.220 --> 07:19.650
Ooh.

07:22.190 --> 07:23.390
How much can I bet?

07:23.390 --> 07:24.900
How much did you bring?

07:24.900 --> 07:27.030
I have to use my own money?

07:27.030 --> 07:30.500
Boy,you really are your father's son,aren't you?

07:30.500 --> 07:32.170
Okay.

07:32.170 --> 07:34.710
I have $14.

07:34.710 --> 07:37.250
That's not gonna get you very far.

07:37.250 --> 07:41.160
Um,oh,and I have a $50 gift certificate to pizza hut.

07:41.160 --> 07:42.080
Want to buy it?

07:42.080 --> 07:43.080
Sure.

07:43.080 --> 07:44.440
I'll give you 25 bucks.

07:44.440 --> 07:45.720
But it's worth $50.

07:45.720 --> 07:46.980
To who?

07:46.980 --> 07:48.150
To pizza hut.

07:48.150 --> 07:51.700
Well,so let the good folks at pizza hut place a bet for you.

07:51.700 --> 07:53.330
You're just trying to rip me off.

07:53.330 --> 07:54.180
Yeah.

07:54.180 --> 07:59.340
I've been staying up nights trying to figure out how to get my hands on your pizza money.

07:59.340 --> 08:01.150
Now,listen and learn.

08:01.150 --> 08:05.100
In any financial transaction there is one question both parties have to ask themselves.

08:05.100 --> 08:07.490
We're going to a party?

08:07.490 --> 08:08.980
Will you shut up and listen?

08:08.980 --> 08:11.530
I thought we were going to the track?

08:11.530 --> 08:15.250
I swear to god,I'm going to throw you out of this car.

08:15.250 --> 08:17.220
Now,as I was saying,

08:17.220 --> 08:21.130
the question is what leverage do I have in this transaction?

08:21.130 --> 08:24.280
The answer for you is "none.

08:24.950 --> 08:26.750
What's leverage?

08:26.750 --> 08:29.020
Oh,boy.

08:29.020 --> 08:32.059
All right,a lever is how you move things.

08:32.059 --> 08:34.390
Leverage is how you move people.

08:34.390 --> 08:36.360
Now,if we were going to pizza hut 

08:36.360 --> 08:39.030
and they didn't take real money and I was starving to death,

08:39.030 --> 08:43.000
your gift certificate would give you leverage over me.

08:43.000 --> 08:46.320
But alas,this is not the case.

08:46.320 --> 08:48.730
Okay,I guess I'll take $40.

08:48.730 --> 08:50.500
Now you're catching on.

08:50.500 --> 08:53.000
But no.

08:53.620 --> 08:55.780
Number at 40 at window "E.

08:55.780 --> 08:59.640
I'm sorry,baby,mama's got to stay here till she gets her license.

08:59.640 --> 09:01.290
I'm hungry,too.

09:01.290 --> 09:02.400
I don't know how much longer.

09:02.400 --> 09:04.610
You want to come in here and wait with me?

09:04.610 --> 09:07.980
All right,you stay in the car and play your video game.

09:07.980 --> 09:11.010
Mommy loves you,too.

09:11.010 --> 09:14.480
I get such little time with him.

09:14.480 --> 09:16.310
Where's his dad?

09:16.310 --> 09:17.980
Damned if I know.

09:17.980 --> 09:21.070
Now serving number 41 at window "B.

09:21.070 --> 09:26.380
" Oh,he is gonna miss his piano lesson.

09:28.520 --> 09:31.320
Listen,um,why don't you take my number?

09:31.320 --> 09:32.280
Oh,I couldn'T.

09:32.280 --> 09:35.600
No,no,no,I insist-- I've got somebody taking care of my little boy,

09:35.600 --> 09:37.360
so I can wait.

09:37.360 --> 09:39.240
That is so sweet.

09:39.240 --> 09:42.140
Now serving number 42 at window "B.

09:42.140 --> 09:43.560
" Oh,you're up.

09:43.560 --> 09:44.800
Thank you so much.

09:44.800 --> 09:46.000
Oh,it's my pleasure.

09:46.000 --> 09:49.400
Hey,listen,maybe,do you think sometime we could maybe go out...

09:49.400 --> 09:51.550
Hey,mama.

09:51.550 --> 09:54.170
Baby,I thought you were waiting in the car.

09:54.170 --> 09:55.700
Batteries are dead.

09:55.700 --> 09:57.960
That's okay.We're out of here.

09:57.960 --> 09:59.090
You lied to me.

09:59.090 --> 10:00.390
No,I didn'T.

10:00.390 --> 10:01.920
Baby,you got a piano lesson today?

10:01.920 --> 10:02.960
Yep.

10:02.960 --> 10:05.140
Gershwin.

10:05.140 --> 10:06.930
See?

10:11.360 --> 10:14.880
Hey,I thought you had her at "squishy ball.

10:22.020 --> 10:24.020
So how much do I get if my horse wins?

10:24.020 --> 10:27.200
If you bet $14 at two to one,you win $28.

10:27.200 --> 10:28.910
That doesn't sound like a lot.

10:28.910 --> 10:30.880
Why can't I bet the 80-to-one horse?

10:30.880 --> 10:31.910
You can,

10:31.910 --> 10:36.020
but there's dogs with forks and napkins waiting at the finish line for him.

10:36.020 --> 10:37.450
What does that mean?

10:37.450 --> 10:40.230
It means the greater the odds,the lousier the horse.

10:40.230 --> 10:42.020
But he could still win,right?

10:42.020 --> 10:46.050
Yeah,and you could still be class valedictorian.

10:46.050 --> 10:48.440
But that's not where the smart money goes.

10:48.440 --> 10:51.440
You can make your point without being mean.

10:51.970 --> 10:54.750
If you want me to bet the 80-to-one horse for you,I will.

10:54.750 --> 10:55.980
Okay,fine.

10:55.980 --> 10:57.460
It'll be a good lesson for you.

10:57.460 --> 10:59.740
You won't be such a know-it-all when...

10:59.740 --> 11:05.340
four times eight's 32,one times is zero is zero-- $120,000.

11:05.340 --> 11:07.860
All right,two lessons.

11:10.860 --> 11:14.560
It's not as much as I thought,but I'm still rich.

11:14.920 --> 11:17.110
You're not rich...

11:17.110 --> 11:19.870
you lucky little peckerhead.

11:19.870 --> 11:23.460
There's no reason for name-calling.

11:23.920 --> 11:26.780
Mr.Smart money.

11:26.780 --> 11:28.130
You want to walk home?

11:28.130 --> 11:29.760
I don't have to walk home.

11:29.760 --> 11:32.520
I could take a taxi or a limo.

11:32.520 --> 11:35.160
Or a hearse.

11:38.870 --> 11:42.320
You were so smart to bring this.

11:42.320 --> 11:45.830
Now serving number 97 at window A.

11:45.830 --> 11:49.360
Hey,that's me.

11:50.000 --> 11:51.180
You hang in there.

11:51.180 --> 11:52.810
Thanks for everything.

11:52.810 --> 11:54.370
You're welcome.

11:54.370 --> 11:57.390
I was being facetious.

12:04.720 --> 12:07.590
Ooh,99.

12:07.590 --> 12:09.660
Lucky you.

12:09.660 --> 12:12.160
I'm 138.

12:12.830 --> 12:15.720
Been here all day.

12:16.030 --> 12:18.450
With my kid waiting in the car.

12:18.450 --> 12:21.040
Nice try.

12:25.330 --> 12:26.770
hey,dad,guess what?

12:26.770 --> 12:29.390
Whoa,whoa,whoa,whoa,he doesn't need to know.

12:29.390 --> 12:30.480
Why not?

12:30.480 --> 12:31.490
Think about it.

12:31.490 --> 12:34.780
What's your father going to do when he finds out you've got $1,120?

12:34.780 --> 12:37.590
Don't worry,I'm not going to lend him any.

12:38.550 --> 12:39.730
No,you clod.

12:39.730 --> 12:41.850
He's going to make you put it in the bank.

12:41.850 --> 12:42.730
Oh,yeah.

12:42.730 --> 12:45.600
Plus he's going to give me grief for taking you to the track.

12:45.600 --> 12:49.570
Oh,so I guess that means I've got leverage on you.

12:50.460 --> 12:52.200
Hey,I can live with the grief.

12:52.200 --> 12:53.390
Can you live without the money?

12:53.390 --> 12:55.980
No,I love the money.

12:55.980 --> 12:57.640
Okay,so here's what you do.

12:57.640 --> 12:59.860
Hide it in your room someplace no one will look.

12:59.860 --> 13:02.410
Oh,I saw this movie once where they put the money in a plastic bag 

13:02.410 --> 13:04.450
and hung it in the toilet.

13:04.450 --> 13:05.170
Bad idea.

13:05.170 --> 13:08.390
Your toilet sees way too much action.

13:09.450 --> 13:11.280
Okay,I'll buy a big safe.

13:11.280 --> 13:14.100
Oh,brilliant-- that won't raise any questions.

13:14.100 --> 13:16.220
Just stick it in a shoe.

13:16.220 --> 13:19.170
But what if I want to wear it?

13:20.350 --> 13:23.010
Then put it in a different shoe.

13:23.010 --> 13:25.960
But not the same pair,right?

13:27.270 --> 13:29.890
Correct.

13:29.890 --> 13:31.820
Now,you have to be careful spending it.

13:31.820 --> 13:33.410
You don't want to call attention to yourself.

13:33.410 --> 13:35.550
Okay,I'll just get a plasma tv.

13:35.550 --> 13:38.730
No,no,no,no,no plasma tvs,

13:38.730 --> 13:40.920
not computers,no expensive video games.

13:40.920 --> 13:43.100
Buy small stuff that no one will notice.

13:43.100 --> 13:44.180
Like donuts?

13:44.180 --> 13:45.440
Perfect.

13:45.440 --> 13:47.860
What about a donut machine?

13:47.860 --> 13:49.750
Okay,you're not hearing me.

13:49.750 --> 13:52.110
I could hide it in the safe.

13:52.960 --> 13:55.190
Get out of here.

13:55.800 --> 13:58.310
Hey,where have you been?

13:58.310 --> 14:00.180
I told you-- the dmv.

14:00.180 --> 14:03.140
All day?You should have made an appointment.

14:04.550 --> 14:07.930
Yeah,next time I'll know.

14:07.930 --> 14:10.020
So what did you guys do today?

14:10.020 --> 14:11.160
Oh,not much.

14:11.160 --> 14:13.320
We just hung out,ran a few errands.

14:13.320 --> 14:15.060
Oh,did you help him with his book report?

14:15.060 --> 14:16.110
Yes,I did.

14:16.110 --> 14:17.560
Really?

14:17.560 --> 14:19.770
No.

14:19.770 --> 14:20.920
Charlie,you said you'd help him.

14:20.920 --> 14:24.870
Yeah,well,you said you'd only be living here for a couple weeks.

14:25.250 --> 14:27.450
And you weren't drunk when you said it.

14:27.450 --> 14:28.430
Fair enough.

14:28.430 --> 14:30.440
So you guys just ran errands all day?

14:30.440 --> 14:32.200
Yes,errands.

14:32.200 --> 14:33.230
Where is he,in his room?

14:33.230 --> 14:35.740
Yes,his room.

14:35.740 --> 14:37.030
Thanks for keeping an eye on him.

14:37.030 --> 14:39.610
No problem.

14:40.750 --> 14:44.250
Oh,I have a bad feeling.

14:45.730 --> 14:46.950
Hey,jake,I'm back.

14:46.950 --> 14:48.720
I was thinking...

14:55.280 --> 14:58.410
charlie made me go to the track.

15:03.480 --> 15:05.090
what a day.

15:05.090 --> 15:07.760
Just sitting and sitting and sitting.

15:13.220 --> 15:17.570
It was like jury duty,without the fun of sending someone to jail.

15:18.320 --> 15:19.540
Sounds awful.

15:19.540 --> 15:21.590
Yeah,yeah.

15:22.180 --> 15:24.730
So...

15:25.050 --> 15:28.010
you guys ran errands today.

15:28.180 --> 15:31.270
The little rat bastard sold me out,didn't he?

15:31.770 --> 15:34.140
Almost immediately.

15:34.990 --> 15:38.190
Why would you take a 13-year-old boy to the track?

15:38.190 --> 15:42.110
Hey,I thought it would be better than him hanging around the house all day doing nothing.

15:42.110 --> 15:44.560
He was supposed to be doing his book report.

15:44.560 --> 15:46.570
Oh,yeah.

15:46.570 --> 15:47.550
And come to think of it,

15:47.550 --> 15:51.020
weren't you supposed to be working on some big credit card jingle?

15:51.020 --> 15:53.130
I'm percolating.

15:53.130 --> 15:55.270
Boy,you are some role model.

15:55.270 --> 15:58.470
Well,one of us has to be.

15:58.470 --> 16:01.580
So,uh,exactly how much did he win?

16:01.580 --> 16:03.930
1100

16:03.930 --> 16:05.430
Wow.

16:05.430 --> 16:06.190
Forget iT.

16:06.190 --> 16:08.500
He's not going to loan you any.

16:08.500 --> 16:09.850
All right,all right,we'll put it in the bank.

16:09.850 --> 16:12.330
It'll be a nice addition to his college fund.

16:12.330 --> 16:13.710
What college fund?

16:13.710 --> 16:16.430
The one with $1,100 in it.

16:16.430 --> 16:17.930
Come on,alan.

16:17.930 --> 16:20.280
He won the money fair and stupid.

16:20.280 --> 16:22.050
So you think I ought to let him keep it?

16:22.050 --> 16:23.530
What's the worst that could happen?

16:23.530 --> 16:24.710
So he blows it.

16:24.710 --> 16:28.410
It's a life lesson and we get a donut machine.

16:28.810 --> 16:30.770
What?

16:31.040 --> 16:32.520
It's just money,alan.

16:32.520 --> 16:34.120
I don't want him to think like that.

16:34.120 --> 16:36.900
Oh,much better he think like you?

16:36.900 --> 16:38.380
Squirreling away every dime he makes 

16:38.380 --> 16:43.280
so he'll haven it handy for alimony payments and phone sex?

16:43.920 --> 16:46.770
For the last time,I misdialed.

16:47.490 --> 16:51.570
Yeah,every wednesday night for 20 minutes.

16:51.570 --> 16:53.930
Okay,okay,we are not talking about the phone bills.

16:53.930 --> 16:56.970
We are talking about teaching jake sound financial principles.

16:56.970 --> 17:00.060
And I am entitled to a date night.

17:01.150 --> 17:01.800
Fine.

17:01.800 --> 17:02.860
Take the money away from him.

17:02.860 --> 17:04.420
No,no,I'm not going to be the bad guy.

17:04.420 --> 17:05.960
I'm not going to be the bad guy either.

17:05.960 --> 17:07.450
Why not?It's your fault.

17:07.450 --> 17:08.760
Hey,if you want to point the finger,

17:08.760 --> 17:13.260
look for the horse trainer who put crystal meth in mr.Mcglue's feed bag.

17:14.910 --> 17:17.880
I'll bet that clydesdale is still running.

17:17.880 --> 17:20.130
Okay,okay,you think you know best?

17:20.130 --> 17:21.510
We'll let him keep the money.

17:21.510 --> 17:24.250
But mark my words,no good can come from a boy like jake 

17:24.250 --> 17:26.099
having that kind of cash to throw arounD.

17:26.099 --> 17:29.470
Oh come on,the kid might surprise you.

17:29.470 --> 17:31.010
Here's a hundred bucks.

17:31.010 --> 17:32.130
What's that for?

17:32.130 --> 17:34.330
I broke a lamp.

17:42.170 --> 17:45.980
it's the card that's accepted all over the globe something,

17:45.980 --> 17:49.340
something...

17:49.340 --> 17:53.010
terrycloth robe.

17:54.430 --> 17:56.720
That's enough for today.

17:56.720 --> 17:58.310
Have you see jake?

17:58.310 --> 18:01.470
Oh,little lord fartleroy?

18:01.470 --> 18:04.030
Well,he wasn't pleased with grilled cheese for lunch,

18:04.030 --> 18:08.120
so he walked down to the red lobster for their all-you-can-eat popcorn shrimp.

18:08.120 --> 18:09.140
Wonderful.

18:09.140 --> 18:13.020
He lined his pockets with foil before he left.

18:13.020 --> 18:14.730
You think this is funny?

18:14.730 --> 18:16.220
The kid gets to throw some money around.

18:16.220 --> 18:17.410
What's wrong with that?

18:17.410 --> 18:21.050
Hey,richie rich back with my crab legs yet?

18:21.050 --> 18:22.880
No.

18:22.880 --> 18:24.160
You don't understand.

18:24.160 --> 18:26.510
Money gives him choices and freedom.

18:26.510 --> 18:27.720
Yeah,so?

18:27.720 --> 18:30.070
I don't have choices and freedom,why should he?

18:30.070 --> 18:34.320
Dad,uncle charlie,come out and see what I just bought.

18:34.820 --> 18:37.890
Oh,I have another bad feeling.

18:41.280 --> 18:44.650
Oh,jake,where did you get that?

18:44.650 --> 18:47.210
A guy had it in the back of his pickup truck at the gas station 

18:47.210 --> 18:48.670
and it had a "for sale" sign.

18:48.670 --> 18:50.240
Oh,no.

18:50.240 --> 18:52.230
I asked him how much it was and he said,"how much you got?

18:52.230 --> 18:54.600
" And I told him $1,106,and he said,"

18:54.600 --> 18:57.160
it's your lucky day.

18:58.050 --> 18:59.140
" Can you believe that?

18:59.140 --> 19:02.230
That's two lucky days in a row.

19:04.480 --> 19:07.070
Okay,I am sorry.

19:07.980 --> 19:09.700
You did not ride that thing here?

19:09.700 --> 19:10.560
Oh,no,I pushed it.

19:10.560 --> 19:11.970
I figured I can ride it on the beach.

19:11.970 --> 19:14.020
Well,you figured wrong-- it's too dangerous.

19:14.020 --> 19:16.340
Don't worry,I got a helmet.

19:17.230 --> 19:21.190
I traded him for a bag of crab legs.

19:21.190 --> 19:22.980
Can you help me take it down to the beach now?

19:22.980 --> 19:24.690
No,you are not riding that thing.

19:24.690 --> 19:26.220
Yeah,well,I bought it with my own money,

19:26.220 --> 19:29.610
so you can't tell me what to do.

19:31.560 --> 19:34.990
Really,I am as sorry as I can possibly be.

19:34.990 --> 19:36.340
Let me just show you how cool it is.

19:36.340 --> 19:38.340
Look,the guy told me how to start it.

19:45.690 --> 19:48.800
He said it might need a tune-up.

19:50.430 --> 19:53.490
So where are my crab legs?

19:55.570 --> 19:56.830
go ahead-- say it.

19:56.830 --> 19:58.800
I'm stupid and I got ripped off.

19:58.800 --> 20:01.180
No,nobody thinks that.

20:01.180 --> 20:03.280
I wouldn't say nobody.

20:03.580 --> 20:04.770
Charlie.

20:04.770 --> 20:07.330
Oh,come on,it's not the end of the world.

20:07.330 --> 20:11.500
Look,jake,sooner or later every guy gets hustled.

20:11.500 --> 20:12.150
Even you?

20:12.150 --> 20:13.340
Even me.

20:13.340 --> 20:15.340
I remember once when i wasn't much older than you,

20:15.340 --> 20:18.890
I spend a hundred bucks on a bag of oregano.

20:21.950 --> 20:22.880
Oregano?

20:22.880 --> 20:25.500
Your uncle was making spaghetti sauce.

20:25.500 --> 20:30.790
Yeah,in a parked car before I went to the pink floyd lasarium show.

20:30.790 --> 20:32.210
Thank you.

20:32.210 --> 20:36.230
The important think is that you learned something that will serve you for the rest of your life.

20:36.230 --> 20:37.320
What's that?

20:37.320 --> 20:42.080
Always buy motorbikes and oregano from authorized dealers.

20:42.080 --> 20:44.230
No,no,that is not the lesson.

20:44.230 --> 20:45.520
A fool and his money are soon parted?

20:45.520 --> 20:47.210
No.

20:47.210 --> 20:48.050
Don't run with scissors?

20:48.050 --> 20:49.250
Do you mind?

20:49.250 --> 20:52.600
Go ahead,I'm down to don't eat the yellow snow.

20:52.790 --> 20:55.300
That's not it,is it?

20:55.880 --> 20:59.590
No,the lesson here is that when a little extra money comes our way,

20:59.590 --> 21:00.940
we do the smart thing-- 

21:00.940 --> 21:04.670
we put it in the bank where it makes reasonable interest at minimal risk.

21:04.670 --> 21:06.690
And then we have it for a rainy day.

21:06.690 --> 21:07.820
Do you understand?

21:07.820 --> 21:08.730
Yeah.

21:08.730 --> 21:10.230
Attaboy.

21:10.230 --> 21:16.030
Trust me,there is no better feeling than knowing you have a little nest egg to fall back on.

21:18.440 --> 21:21.720
There are at least eight better feelings.

21:21.720 --> 21:22.710
Charlie!

21:22.710 --> 21:24.110
Coming.
