00:05.573 --> 00:08.042
*

00:49.250 --> 00:51.819
* Boom, boom, boom, boom

00:51.852 --> 00:54.488
* Bang, bang, bang, bang

00:54.522 --> 00:57.125
* Boom, boom, boom, boom

00:57.158 --> 00:58.292
* How, how, how, how

00:58.326 --> 01:00.394
* Hey, hey

01:06.434 --> 01:07.835
* You gotta come on.

01:16.744 --> 01:18.212
Laurel.

01:18.246 --> 01:19.247
Dad.

01:19.280 --> 01:20.681
You okay

01:20.714 --> 01:23.384
I'm fine.
I'm just... freaked out.

01:23.417 --> 01:24.352
You're safe now, baby girl.

01:24.385 --> 01:27.221
He came out of nowhere.

01:27.255 --> 01:28.156
I didn't even see him

01:28.189 --> 01:30.291
until he was on me,
and then he grabbed me,

01:30.324 --> 01:32.893
and I was just...
I was so scared, I...

01:32.926 --> 01:34.128
But you fought.

01:34.162 --> 01:35.696
I think I killed him.

01:35.729 --> 01:37.431
Come here.

01:39.633 --> 01:43.337
They said they had to take swabs
from my fingernails.

01:43.371 --> 01:46.274
No, they're just looking for the
DNA on the guy who attacked you.

01:46.307 --> 01:48.876
I should have been more careful.
I shouldn't have gone out alone.

01:48.909 --> 01:50.278
No, no, no, no, no.

01:50.311 --> 01:52.413
You are not responsible
for this.

01:52.446 --> 01:54.448
Sweetheart, there's no way
you could've known.

01:54.482 --> 01:56.384
But that's the thing,
I kind of did.

01:56.417 --> 01:59.353
The last few days,
I noticed this van

01:59.387 --> 02:00.854
on campus near my apartment.

02:00.888 --> 02:02.823
Like, it was following me.

02:02.856 --> 02:04.192
Can you describe it?

02:04.225 --> 02:06.327
It was, uh, gold colored.

02:06.360 --> 02:08.862
Old looking,
but someone had fixed it up.

02:08.896 --> 02:10.298
Why didn't you tell
me about this?

02:10.331 --> 02:11.865
If I called you every time

02:11.899 --> 02:14.202
I saw something weird
on campus...

02:14.235 --> 02:15.636
Okay, but did you tell
the detective?

02:15.669 --> 02:18.539
Yeah. He didn't seem to care.

02:18.572 --> 02:19.540
PRIDE:
All right, you stay here.

02:19.573 --> 02:21.742
I'm gonna go talk to him.

02:26.414 --> 02:29.183
NCIS.

02:29.217 --> 02:31.619
Miss Pride didn't tell me
she was Navy.

02:31.652 --> 02:33.354
She's my daughter.

02:33.387 --> 02:34.555
Dwayne Pride.

02:34.588 --> 02:36.357
Detective Lamont.

02:36.390 --> 02:38.359
We usually don't get a visit

02:38.392 --> 02:40.494
from the parents
at a crime scene.

02:40.528 --> 02:42.196
Yeah, well,
it's not a visit.

02:42.230 --> 02:44.265
Hoping for a little
professional courtesy.

02:45.433 --> 02:47.401
What do you know about him?

02:47.435 --> 02:49.470
Reggie Clifton. Local boy.

02:49.503 --> 02:51.572
Got a record and a reputation.

02:51.605 --> 02:54.342
Harassing women
at the university got him...

02:54.375 --> 02:55.976
banned from the campus.

02:56.009 --> 03:00.214
No surprise
he's graduated to assault.

03:00.248 --> 03:01.449
My daughter mentioned
she saw a van

03:01.482 --> 03:03.284
following her the last few days.

03:03.317 --> 03:04.318
Yeah, she told me.

03:04.352 --> 03:05.319
And?

03:05.353 --> 03:08.456
I don't know how you Navy cops

03:08.489 --> 03:10.458
work a case,
but I do it

03:10.491 --> 03:12.260
like I'm walking
down the street--

03:12.293 --> 03:14.362
one foot in front of the other.

03:14.395 --> 03:15.863
You feel me?

03:19.700 --> 03:22.603
I'll let you get back to work.

03:25.373 --> 03:28.008
So, I found this tire mark
in the mud.

03:28.041 --> 03:30.544
It's big enough
for a truck or a van.

03:30.578 --> 03:33.781
You, uh, want to tell
the detectives about it?

03:33.814 --> 03:38.452
Yeah. But take a photo first,
get it to Sebastian.

03:38.486 --> 03:41.922
I know--
not our investigation. But...

03:41.955 --> 03:43.991
You think Laurel's right

03:44.024 --> 03:45.826
about someone following her?
Yeah.

03:45.859 --> 03:49.497
I can't help but feel
it's got to do with me.

03:52.366 --> 03:55.569
SEBASTIAN: All right, so, here
are the photos that Sonja took

03:55.603 --> 03:57.971
of the tire marks.
I scanned it into the computer,

03:58.005 --> 04:00.374
then rendered
a 3D version of it.

04:00.408 --> 04:02.776
Each tread, ridge and dimple.

04:02.810 --> 04:05.446
So, light truck tires,
not uncommon on pickup trucks,

04:05.479 --> 04:07.448
but less common on vans.

04:07.481 --> 04:09.283
Which is what Laurel said
was following her.

04:09.317 --> 04:10.718
Laurel was being followed?

04:10.751 --> 04:13.387
Brody, Lasalle, where were you?

04:13.421 --> 04:14.455
Stuck on the Westbank searching

04:14.488 --> 04:16.557
for Petty Officer Peal's
house again.

04:16.590 --> 04:18.592
Who the hell
is Petty Officer Peal?

04:18.626 --> 04:19.960
Person of interest
in the Belle Chasse break-in

04:19.993 --> 04:21.395
we've been working all week.

04:21.429 --> 04:22.763
Those stolen hard drives.

04:22.796 --> 04:24.398
Yeah, and it's the only
witness we can't find.

04:24.432 --> 04:26.300
What were you saying
about Laurel again?

04:26.334 --> 04:28.869
I don't have all the details,
but Percy sent Sebastian over

04:28.902 --> 04:30.538
some photos of tire tread.

04:30.571 --> 04:32.940
Van that was following Laurel
for the last few days.

04:32.973 --> 04:34.742
Yeah, and I've narrowed down
the kind of vans

04:34.775 --> 04:36.910
that we need to be looking for--
long wheel base,

04:36.944 --> 04:38.579
modified full sized...

04:38.612 --> 04:41.415
I can send all this info
over to Baton Rouge PD, and they

04:41.449 --> 04:43.484
can search through traffic and
security cameras around campus.

04:43.517 --> 04:45.553
Be more efficient
if we cut out the middleman.

04:45.586 --> 04:47.087
I can liberate the footage
from here.

04:47.120 --> 04:48.622
Yeah, but it's not our case.

04:48.656 --> 04:50.491
Yeah, but it's family.

04:50.524 --> 04:51.959
Let's do it.

04:55.496 --> 04:58.666
LAMONT:
Reggie Clifton will not be
bothering anybody ever again.

04:58.699 --> 05:00.668
Clifton barely had
a mark on him.

05:00.701 --> 05:02.836
Couple of elbows
from my daughter

05:02.870 --> 05:05.005
doesn't explain
his sudden death.

05:05.038 --> 05:08.509
Well, we'll know more
once the autopsy's done.

05:08.542 --> 05:11.545
One foot in front
of the other, remember?

05:11.579 --> 05:12.746
Now,

05:12.780 --> 05:14.615
you've never seen

05:14.648 --> 05:15.649
Reggie Clifton before?

05:15.683 --> 05:17.851
No, sir. Like I said,

05:17.885 --> 05:20.087
not until he grabbed me
on the running trail.

05:20.120 --> 05:22.756
But you say he was
following you in a van?

05:22.790 --> 05:24.458
I said a van's
been following me.

05:24.492 --> 05:26.460
The man who attacked me
was never in it.

05:26.494 --> 05:27.595
There was someone else?

05:27.628 --> 05:29.930
LAMONT: Well, how
could you be sure?

05:29.963 --> 05:32.600
Now, this specific van
with a specific driver

05:32.633 --> 05:34.635
that's not Reggie Clifton

05:34.668 --> 05:36.370
has been following you for days?

05:36.404 --> 05:39.072
I've been staring at this photo
while you questioned me.

05:39.106 --> 05:41.775
This wasn't the person
in the van.

05:41.809 --> 05:43.677
I've been taught to pay
attention to my surroundings,

05:43.711 --> 05:46.780
note anything
or anyone suspicious.

05:46.814 --> 05:49.049
Well, your father
did teach you a lot.

05:49.082 --> 05:53.020
How about, uh... get her
some mug shots to look at?

05:53.053 --> 05:55.456
Try and identify
the van driver.

05:55.489 --> 05:59.026
Special Agent Pride, could we
chat in the hallway, please?

05:59.059 --> 06:01.462
Excuse us.

06:03.897 --> 06:05.933
What are you doing?

06:05.966 --> 06:08.669
Trying to get to the bottom
of what happened to my daughter.

06:08.702 --> 06:10.538
That's not your job here.
You're not the investigator

06:10.571 --> 06:12.640
on the case; you're the dad.
I got a feeling

06:12.673 --> 06:15.876
this van following Laurel
has something to do with me.

06:15.909 --> 06:17.711
What would it have
to do with you?

06:17.745 --> 06:19.847
May be one of my old cases;
I'm not sure yet.

06:19.880 --> 06:21.849
Look, I'm not trying
to step on your toes...

06:21.882 --> 06:23.951
Well, that's all you're doing.
I don't blame you,

06:23.984 --> 06:26.654
but I need you to back off,
funny feeling or not.

06:32.092 --> 06:34.061
All right, you're right.
I'll back off,

06:34.094 --> 06:36.797
if you get those mug shots
to Laurel

06:36.830 --> 06:38.165
so she can look at them.

06:52.179 --> 06:54.582
Wait-wait-wait, you don't want
to tell Detective Lamont

06:54.615 --> 06:56.817
about this?
Waste of time.
Might be a dead end.

07:06.860 --> 07:08.629
Sonja.
Yeah?

07:08.662 --> 07:10.731
:
Flat tire.

07:10.764 --> 07:13.200
I'll open the back.
Yeah.

07:16.504 --> 07:17.705
It's locked.

07:17.738 --> 07:19.707
Bust it.

07:30.050 --> 07:32.520
It's clear.

07:43.597 --> 07:45.098
That's outside NCIS.

07:45.132 --> 07:47.000
My bar.

07:47.034 --> 07:48.936
Laurel's apartment.

07:48.969 --> 07:50.938
No question about it.

07:50.971 --> 07:53.807
Whoever owns this van...

07:53.841 --> 07:56.209
they're after me.

08:06.687 --> 08:10.057
LASALLE: We found these
outside NCIS, the morgue,

08:10.090 --> 08:12.760
the bar, and other places
you frequent.

08:12.793 --> 08:14.562
Including Laurel's apartment.

08:14.595 --> 08:16.263
Someone is after you.

08:16.296 --> 08:18.065
All of us.
Patton did

08:18.098 --> 08:20.167
a sweep of the office,
Sebastian swept the morgue--

08:20.200 --> 08:22.603
no cameras or listening devices.

08:22.636 --> 08:25.105
All right? Suspects
didn't have access inside.

08:25.138 --> 08:28.175
Well, whoever's been watching us
has been doing it for a while.

08:28.208 --> 08:31.579
Laurel's safe now, King.
Yeah, well, she should
never have been vulnerable.

08:31.612 --> 08:33.614
They went after her
to get to me.

08:33.647 --> 08:35.148
This is our top priority.

08:35.182 --> 08:36.984
Baton Rouge PD sent
their evidence.

08:37.017 --> 08:38.619
Weren't too happy about it.

08:38.652 --> 08:39.920
LASALLE:
Wade's got the body

08:39.953 --> 08:41.922
of the man that attacked
Laurel this morning,

08:41.955 --> 08:43.156
Reggie Clifton.

08:43.190 --> 08:45.092
Semi-employed
short-order cook.

08:45.125 --> 08:46.994
Hobbies include
indecent exposure

08:47.027 --> 08:48.996
and harassing
college students.

08:49.029 --> 08:51.799
It's not exactly the profile
of someone operating a van

08:51.832 --> 08:53.667
filled with high-tech
surveillance equipment.

08:53.701 --> 08:55.603
Laurel saw someone else
in the van.

08:55.636 --> 08:57.738
We've compiled an enemies list.

08:58.772 --> 09:00.874
PRIDE: Well, obvious answer--
the Militia.

09:00.908 --> 09:03.043
Anti-military radicals.

09:03.076 --> 09:05.078
Tried to kill me.
Put a bounty on my head.

09:05.112 --> 09:06.880
You put their leader,

09:06.914 --> 09:08.048
Zed Hastings, in prison.

09:08.081 --> 09:09.883
Most of the rest

09:09.917 --> 09:11.051
are dead
or behind bars.

09:11.084 --> 09:12.620
BRODY:
Then there's the Broussards,

09:12.653 --> 09:14.254
but Sasha's locked up.

09:14.287 --> 09:16.590
And then you got
the recent additions

09:16.624 --> 09:18.926
to the
"I Hate Dwayne Pride" club,

09:18.959 --> 09:21.128
Hugo Garza and Marc Maslow.

09:21.161 --> 09:23.363
Dad.

09:23.396 --> 09:24.264
How many people

09:24.297 --> 09:25.966
want you dead?

09:33.774 --> 09:36.744
I always knew your job
was dangerous.

09:36.777 --> 09:39.046
Last year
when Orion got hurt...

09:39.079 --> 09:41.649
it became real.

09:41.682 --> 09:43.917
Or I thought it did.

09:43.951 --> 09:46.153
Your whole life...

09:46.186 --> 09:48.388
I've taken it
as a badge of honor

09:48.421 --> 09:51.091
that I could shield you
from the worst...

09:51.124 --> 09:52.993
that I do.

09:54.294 --> 09:56.897
What happened today...

09:56.930 --> 09:58.999
is not gonna happen again.

09:59.032 --> 10:01.134
What happened today
is that I killed someone.

10:01.168 --> 10:02.235
We don't know that.

10:02.269 --> 10:03.637
I hit him.

10:03.671 --> 10:05.138
He died.

10:05.172 --> 10:08.408
It doesn't happen like that,
baby girl.

10:08.441 --> 10:10.644
Then how does it happen, Dad?

10:10.678 --> 10:12.412
Look...

10:12.445 --> 10:14.748
let's see what Loretta says

10:14.782 --> 10:16.283
after her autopsy.

10:16.316 --> 10:17.417
But either way...

10:17.450 --> 10:19.853
you protected yourself

10:19.887 --> 10:21.722
and I'm proud of you.

10:28.028 --> 10:30.430
Sonja's gonna take you
somewhere secure

10:30.463 --> 10:32.165
until this blows over.

10:32.199 --> 10:34.034
Where are we going?

10:34.067 --> 10:36.036
A safe house.
Your bags are in the car.

10:36.069 --> 10:38.038
We're gonna take you out
through the back exit.

10:38.071 --> 10:39.840
You coming, too?

10:39.873 --> 10:41.308
I'm staying.

10:41.341 --> 10:43.176
I got to make this right.

10:43.210 --> 10:45.145
I saw all those people
who hate you.

10:45.178 --> 10:46.980
You need protection, too.

10:47.014 --> 10:48.782
But they didn't come after me.

10:48.816 --> 10:50.417
They went after you.

10:50.450 --> 10:52.652
We can't have that.

10:58.992 --> 11:01.061
*

11:01.094 --> 11:04.031
I'll be okay.

11:04.064 --> 11:05.966
:
Promise.

11:14.074 --> 11:15.743
Percy.

11:20.981 --> 11:24.684
I'm trusting you with the most
precious thing in my life.

11:25.753 --> 11:27.755
I got this.

11:30.290 --> 11:33.160
LASALLE:
We have a visitor, King.

11:35.763 --> 11:37.264
Karen Hardy.

11:37.297 --> 11:39.266
A long way from Camp Lejeune.

11:39.299 --> 11:41.835
Hey.
Ah. Not at Lejeune anymore.

11:41.869 --> 11:44.271
I'm a senior agent
with CRFO.

11:44.304 --> 11:46.239
What?

11:46.273 --> 11:48.241
Why would Contingency
Response Field Office

11:48.275 --> 11:50.343
send a senior agent?
I get deployed

11:50.377 --> 11:51.845
to high-risk environments.

11:51.879 --> 11:53.847
This here--
definition of high-risk.

11:53.881 --> 11:55.348
Since we go back...

11:55.382 --> 11:57.084
What is DC worried about?

11:57.117 --> 11:58.485
Want a list?

11:58.518 --> 12:00.921
You told DC
you're under surveillance

12:00.954 --> 12:02.923
and what happened to Laurel.

12:02.956 --> 12:05.225
If you're a target,
you need help.

12:05.258 --> 12:07.327
The situation is under control.

12:07.360 --> 12:09.329
Is it?
According to Baton Rouge,

12:09.362 --> 12:12.265
you hijacked their crime scene,
hacked into their traffic cams,

12:12.299 --> 12:13.901
and took possession

12:13.934 --> 12:17.070
of a suspected van
before this was an NCIS matter.

12:17.104 --> 12:18.305
Wow.

12:18.338 --> 12:20.073
Now, about this
Reggie Clifton.

12:22.275 --> 12:24.111
Tell me things.

12:24.144 --> 12:28.248
No affiliation with the people
on your enemy list.

12:28.281 --> 12:31.318
He's a loner, antisocial--
wouldn't be part of a group.

12:31.351 --> 12:33.787
Yeah, but there's no way
he acted alone.

12:33.821 --> 12:35.856
And no way that he
had the resources

12:35.889 --> 12:37.958
to obtain the
surveillance van.

12:37.991 --> 12:40.260
All right, keep digging.

12:40.293 --> 12:41.962
Let's chat.

12:47.835 --> 12:50.070
Senior agent, huh?

12:50.103 --> 12:52.906
Dwayne, it's me, not some
suit from Washington.

12:52.940 --> 12:54.374
Yeah.

12:54.407 --> 12:56.209
But they sent you.

12:56.243 --> 12:57.978
Well, can you blame them?

12:58.011 --> 13:00.948
How many people tried
to kill you in the last year?

13:00.981 --> 13:02.282
I'm not hard to find.

13:02.315 --> 13:04.284
Someone wants revenge,
they can try.

13:04.317 --> 13:05.853
This is different.

13:05.886 --> 13:08.421
Timing's... specific.

13:08.455 --> 13:10.891
You think this is
an elaborate distraction?

13:10.924 --> 13:12.125
Something like that.

13:12.159 --> 13:13.827
You know how that sounds?

13:13.861 --> 13:15.863
It sounds
the way it sounds.

13:15.896 --> 13:19.466
The bottom line...
I don't need a babysitter.

13:19.499 --> 13:21.468
Look, your daughter
was attacked.

13:21.501 --> 13:24.404
And you're here to make sure
I don't take it personally,

13:24.437 --> 13:26.874
don't cross the line.
Yeah.

13:30.343 --> 13:32.880
Autopsy result's in. I'll go.

13:32.913 --> 13:34.414
Alone?

13:34.447 --> 13:37.017
From one building
filled with cops to another.

13:37.050 --> 13:38.451
Don't need backup.

13:38.485 --> 13:40.320
Well, let's keep it
that way, huh?

13:40.353 --> 13:42.322
Till we know more
about this threat to you,

13:42.355 --> 13:43.891
best you stay out of the field.

13:43.924 --> 13:45.525
That an order?

13:45.558 --> 13:47.928
No. Common sense.

13:51.899 --> 13:53.867
WADE:
Mr. Clifton's C.O.D.

13:53.901 --> 13:55.568
was cardiac arrest.

13:55.602 --> 13:57.404
He have a heart condition?

13:57.437 --> 13:58.605
I ran his blood work.

13:58.638 --> 14:00.440
Came up clean
with one exception.

14:04.044 --> 14:06.013
Elevated levels of adrenaline?

14:06.046 --> 14:08.015
It's not uncommon
in a heart attack.

14:08.048 --> 14:10.483
However, the human body
does not produce

14:10.517 --> 14:12.953
this much adrenaline naturally.

14:12.986 --> 14:15.155
He has track marks on his arms.

14:15.188 --> 14:17.390
Adrenaline as a street drug?

14:17.424 --> 14:20.994
My experience of addicts:
if it's shootable, it's doable.

14:21.028 --> 14:23.563
So Laurel wasn't responsible?

14:23.596 --> 14:25.966
Well, I'm not done
with the examination.

14:25.999 --> 14:27.467
When I know, you will.

14:29.302 --> 14:31.604
Who's Special Agent Hardy?

14:31.638 --> 14:34.174
And why is she
checking up on you?

14:34.207 --> 14:35.508
Former trainee agent of mine.

14:35.542 --> 14:37.544
DC sent her in my hour of need.

14:37.577 --> 14:39.446
I'm supposed
to stay out of the field

14:39.479 --> 14:41.648
until the threat is assessed.

14:41.681 --> 14:43.550
Good.

14:43.583 --> 14:47.387
You're perfectly able
to look after yourself normally,

14:47.420 --> 14:50.290
but when things get personal...

14:50.323 --> 14:53.493
I can't help but worry
about your judgment.

14:53.526 --> 14:55.695
Loretta...
That you may end up
on the wrong side

14:55.728 --> 14:57.564
of my autopsy table.

15:01.268 --> 15:03.570
Special Agent Hardy
would like me to confirm

15:03.603 --> 15:05.672
that you're coming back to NCIS.

15:05.705 --> 15:08.308
Go ahead and confirm.

15:08.341 --> 15:09.476
Are you heading back?

15:13.146 --> 15:15.048
SEBASTIAN:
Who's ready to enter

15:15.082 --> 15:17.117
the wonderful world of vans?

15:19.152 --> 15:21.588
Sebastian Lund,
forensic expert,

15:21.621 --> 15:24.324
and Patton Plame,
computer specialist.

15:24.357 --> 15:25.993
Otherwise known
as the Wonder Twins.

15:26.026 --> 15:28.261
I told you I'm not down
with that Wonder Twins bit.

15:28.295 --> 15:30.430
And I told you that you don't
choose your nickname, okay?

15:30.463 --> 15:32.132
Your nickname chooses you.
Come on, man, help me out.

15:32.165 --> 15:33.500
Well, I'm Special Agent Hardy.

15:33.533 --> 15:34.634
Hoping you got
something for us.

15:34.667 --> 15:37.570
Yeah, a nasty case of van envy.

15:37.604 --> 15:40.740
The computer system
on this bad boy is gnarly.

15:40.773 --> 15:42.342
It has five quad core
multiprocessors,

15:42.375 --> 15:43.710
each with a terabyte

15:43.743 --> 15:45.712
of RAM, ultra HD monitors...

15:45.745 --> 15:47.414
Yeah, and don't
get me started

15:47.447 --> 15:48.982
on the laser microphone.

15:49.016 --> 15:52.019
It's got an active range
of up to 400 MTS.

15:52.052 --> 15:53.553
LASALLE:
That means they can listen to us

15:53.586 --> 15:55.388
through walls
and from a distance.

15:55.422 --> 15:56.556
This is a custom job.

15:56.589 --> 15:58.258
And judging by
the circuitry,

15:58.291 --> 15:59.492
it's European in origin;
same with the cameras.

15:59.526 --> 16:00.493
Yeah.

16:00.527 --> 16:01.661
Hundreds of hours
of surveillance

16:01.694 --> 16:03.330
on this hard drive.

16:03.363 --> 16:05.198
Every second transmitted
over Wi-Fi.

16:05.232 --> 16:06.466
Transmitted to who?

16:06.499 --> 16:08.101
That's what I'm working
on finding out.

16:08.135 --> 16:10.103
European computers
and cameras--

16:10.137 --> 16:12.372
are we looking
at espionage here?

16:12.405 --> 16:14.574
Well, the hardware may be
from across the pond,

16:14.607 --> 16:16.676
but the van itself,
that's 100% American.

16:16.709 --> 16:19.046
It's also customized.
Check this out.

16:19.079 --> 16:22.082
The storage area had to be
retrofitted for the computers,

16:22.115 --> 16:24.017
it's a new cooling system,

16:24.051 --> 16:26.286
and a high-density antenna
for the Wi-Fi.

16:26.319 --> 16:28.021
Trace any of the equipment?

16:28.055 --> 16:29.689
Uh, I did, yeah.

16:29.722 --> 16:31.491
Uh, most of
the custom stuff was sent

16:31.524 --> 16:34.061
to a Devil's Detailing Garage
in Metairie.

16:34.094 --> 16:35.762
Owned by a Troy Spooner.

16:35.795 --> 16:37.597
All right, give Pride a shout,
loop him in.

16:37.630 --> 16:39.099
Have him meet us there.

16:39.132 --> 16:40.367
Oh, Pride already knows.
I called him.

16:40.400 --> 16:41.501
He's on his way there right now.

16:43.336 --> 16:45.305
Was that wrong?

16:47.607 --> 16:49.342
Hello?

16:49.376 --> 16:51.278
I run a volume business here.

16:51.311 --> 16:53.280
Ten guys.
Quick turnaround.

16:53.313 --> 16:57.350
After-market components,
rims, the odd paint job.

16:57.384 --> 16:59.186
Can't remember 'em all.

16:59.219 --> 17:00.320
Not asking for 'em all.

17:00.353 --> 17:04.357
Asking if you remember
one in particular.

17:05.358 --> 17:07.194
Not ringin' any bells, no.

17:07.227 --> 17:09.329
It was converted into
a mobile surveillance van.

17:09.362 --> 17:11.331
Not exactly
"quick turnaround."

17:11.364 --> 17:14.334
Having a hard time believing
you don't recall it.

17:15.702 --> 17:17.704
I don't know what
to tell you, brother.

17:17.737 --> 17:19.172
How about this guy?

17:19.206 --> 17:20.207
He ring your bells?

17:20.240 --> 17:22.175
Nope.

17:22.209 --> 17:24.344
How about if you
actually look?

17:27.647 --> 17:29.216
I don't know him, brother.

17:29.249 --> 17:31.351
What I know, brother--

17:31.384 --> 17:34.821
parts for that van were ordered
from this shop, by you.

17:35.755 --> 17:37.390
Don't cooperate,

17:37.424 --> 17:39.326
I'll come back with a warrant

17:39.359 --> 17:41.094
and a dozen federal agents.

17:42.429 --> 17:44.231
No need to get frosty.

17:44.264 --> 17:46.699
Just about to suggest
we look in the files.

17:51.604 --> 17:54.474
Ah! What the hell?

17:54.507 --> 17:56.176
Pullin' a gun
on a federal agent?

17:56.209 --> 17:57.310
Huh?
No way.

18:00.447 --> 18:02.415
"Sic Semper Tyrannis."

18:02.449 --> 18:04.251
You're Militia?

18:04.284 --> 18:05.485
No idea what
you're talking about.

18:05.518 --> 18:07.420
You following my daughter?

18:07.454 --> 18:09.222
Hmm?
You got me wrong, brother.

18:10.290 --> 18:11.424
But I will say your little girl

18:11.458 --> 18:13.260
sure looks good
in her runnin' shorts.

18:13.293 --> 18:15.128
What'd you say?

18:23.470 --> 18:25.438
Ah!
You follow my daughter?

18:25.472 --> 18:26.239
Were you following my daughter?!

18:26.273 --> 18:28.208
Dwayne!
Were you following her?

18:28.241 --> 18:30.143
Dwayne! Stop, now!

18:48.528 --> 18:51.264
Want to explain
why you assaulted my client?

18:51.298 --> 18:53.266
I didn't assault him.

18:53.300 --> 18:55.268
I restrained him.
He was resisting arrest.

18:55.302 --> 18:56.503
That's the story
we're goin' with?

18:56.536 --> 18:58.471
Be quiet, Troy.

18:58.505 --> 19:00.340
He was reaching for a handgun.
SPOONER:
I was looking for paperwork.

19:00.373 --> 19:02.309
Stop talking, Troy.

19:02.342 --> 19:04.277
Your client is
a person of interest

19:04.311 --> 19:05.345
in an ongoing investigation.

19:05.378 --> 19:07.280
He customized a van
that was used

19:07.314 --> 19:10.450
to surveil me,
my office, my daughter.

19:10.483 --> 19:12.319
I am sorry that your daughter
was attacked.

19:12.352 --> 19:14.254
But it's my understanding

19:14.287 --> 19:16.356
that the man responsible
is dead.

19:16.389 --> 19:18.425
He wasn't working alone.

19:18.458 --> 19:20.593
We need to ask Mr. Spooner
some questions

19:20.627 --> 19:22.262
about this van.

19:22.295 --> 19:24.531
And the attack
on Agent Pride's daughter.

19:24.564 --> 19:27.367
And why would Mr. Spooner
be interested

19:27.400 --> 19:28.601
in either you or your daughter?

19:28.635 --> 19:30.637
Because he's a member
of the Militia.

19:30.670 --> 19:32.705
Oh, see, I'm confused.
Because I hear the Militia

19:32.739 --> 19:34.874
is a radical group
that you helped disband.

19:34.907 --> 19:36.509
It doesn't exist anymore.
They're still active.

19:36.543 --> 19:38.445
He's one of 'em.
Tattooed right on his arm.

19:38.478 --> 19:39.779
Oh, so is that why
you assaulted my client?

19:39.812 --> 19:41.214
Because of his body art?

19:41.248 --> 19:42.615
I didn't assault him.

19:42.649 --> 19:44.384
But he was there
when my daughter was attacked,

19:44.417 --> 19:46.185
and he's a part of this.

19:47.487 --> 19:49.322
My client was with me

19:49.356 --> 19:50.557
when your daughter was attacked.

19:50.590 --> 19:51.724
I was giving him advice

19:51.758 --> 19:53.393
on another legal matter.

19:53.426 --> 19:56.229
I'd be happy to sign
an affidavit to that effect.

19:57.430 --> 20:00.500
Look, Agent Pride,

20:00.533 --> 20:02.735
I'm sorry for your troubles.

20:02.769 --> 20:04.804
But Mr. Spooner just simply
isn't involved,

20:04.837 --> 20:07.574
and he has nothing to say
to either one of you.

20:07.607 --> 20:10.410
Unless you charge him,

20:10.443 --> 20:11.678
we're leaving.

20:24.056 --> 20:26.426
Shouldn't have gone
to his garage alone.

20:26.459 --> 20:28.695
Aside from the danger, there's
no one to back your story.

20:28.728 --> 20:30.430
You always think
like a prosecutor.

20:30.463 --> 20:33.032
Every T crossed,
every I dotted.

20:33.065 --> 20:34.834
You say that like it's bad.

20:34.867 --> 20:36.469
But that's the end game.

20:36.503 --> 20:37.537
A courtroom.

20:37.570 --> 20:39.372
Convictions.

20:39.406 --> 20:41.374
Or are you looking for
another kind of justice, Dwayne?

20:41.408 --> 20:44.411
I'm not out for revenge, Karen.

20:44.444 --> 20:46.479
I want to protect Laurel.

20:46.513 --> 20:49.382
But there's something
bigger going on.

20:49.416 --> 20:51.518
Militia's behind it.

20:51.551 --> 20:53.486
Keepin' me off my game.

20:53.520 --> 20:55.388
And you... you're-you're playing
right into it.

20:55.422 --> 20:57.357
Looking out
for my former partner.

20:57.390 --> 20:59.392
I'm clear-eyed.

21:01.328 --> 21:04.497
The only question now is why?

21:04.531 --> 21:05.532
Why now?

21:05.565 --> 21:06.799
Timing means something.

21:06.833 --> 21:08.468
So you went off
after Troy Spooner

21:08.501 --> 21:09.802
half

21:09.836 --> 21:11.971
When have I ever done anything
half

21:16.042 --> 21:17.777
Handle things your own way.

21:17.810 --> 21:20.347
Always have.

21:20.380 --> 21:22.415
Lotta improvisation,

21:22.449 --> 21:23.783
instinct.

21:23.816 --> 21:25.552
Your team, too.

21:25.585 --> 21:27.354
Doesn't go unnoticed.

21:27.387 --> 21:29.556
You say that like it's bad.

21:31.358 --> 21:32.792
Look, we... we charge Spooner

21:32.825 --> 21:34.527
with resisting arrest,
the gun...

21:34.561 --> 21:35.562
No. No.

21:35.595 --> 21:37.330
He's our only link

21:37.364 --> 21:39.532
to the attack on Laurel
and that van.

21:39.566 --> 21:41.534
And he's no use to us
if he's locked up.

21:43.903 --> 21:45.472
All right, if he walks,

21:45.505 --> 21:48.408
you need to take
a serious step back.

21:48.441 --> 21:50.343
Let me handle it from here.

21:50.377 --> 21:52.445
Can't be "we" right now.

21:52.479 --> 21:54.113
You see that, right?

21:54.146 --> 21:58.050
I'll bring in my own agents.

21:58.084 --> 22:01.053
LASALLE: Okay, so if you're not
gonna let us tail Spooner,

22:01.087 --> 22:02.622
what are we
supposed to do?

22:02.655 --> 22:06.393
Petty Officer Nelson Peal
is still missing,

22:06.426 --> 22:07.760
along with a dozen
Navy hard drives.

22:07.794 --> 22:08.761
That's what you do.

22:08.795 --> 22:12.432
Hardy is 1,000% correct.

22:12.465 --> 22:13.666
King, it's...

22:13.700 --> 22:15.502
Work the case.

22:15.535 --> 22:17.437
Find the sailor.

22:17.470 --> 22:19.038
I'm gonna go look after Laurel.

22:22.174 --> 22:23.410
LAUREL:
It's so gloomy in here.

22:23.443 --> 22:24.977
How can you stand it?

22:25.011 --> 22:26.513
Mmm...

22:26.546 --> 22:28.681
You get used to it.

22:28.715 --> 22:31.584
I, uh, was here
for close to two years

22:31.618 --> 22:34.521
during my undercover days.

22:34.554 --> 22:36.556
Main selling point is

22:36.589 --> 22:38.825
I was never worried
I was gonna be shot here.

22:38.858 --> 22:41.494
I could...
let my guard down.

22:41.528 --> 22:42.929
Be myself.

22:42.962 --> 22:45.532
Hey, I even learned
to love it a bit.

22:45.565 --> 22:47.934
Is that what it's like
for my dad?

22:47.967 --> 22:49.836
Always looking
over his shoulder?

22:49.869 --> 22:52.772
You know what? You don't have
to worry about your father.

22:52.805 --> 22:54.907
He takes care of himself.

22:54.941 --> 22:56.943
Takes care of himself.

22:58.811 --> 23:01.113
You mean like I did today?

23:01.147 --> 23:02.582
With that man?

23:02.615 --> 23:05.017
Don't dwell on it,

23:05.051 --> 23:07.053
'cause you did
what you had to do.

23:07.086 --> 23:08.921
That's what everyone
keeps saying.

23:08.955 --> 23:10.923
It doesn't change the facts.

23:12.625 --> 23:14.961
Look, I've been
where you are, Laurel.

23:14.994 --> 23:17.597
I know how you feel.

23:17.630 --> 23:20.467
How do you get over it?

23:20.500 --> 23:22.869
You don't.

23:22.902 --> 23:25.705
You learn to live with it.

23:25.738 --> 23:28.207
You survive it.

23:28.240 --> 23:29.842
You survive.

23:37.016 --> 23:38.451
Is that my dad?

23:38.485 --> 23:39.819
Is he coming here?

23:39.852 --> 23:42.589
No, not yet.

23:42.622 --> 23:44.791
*

24:14.587 --> 24:16.589
*

24:59.231 --> 25:01.233
Christopher, it's me.

25:03.035 --> 25:05.972
Troy Spooner
and at least three other men

25:06.005 --> 25:08.074
just tried to run me down.

25:08.107 --> 25:10.643
Yeah, black pickup.

25:10.677 --> 25:12.579
Lakebound.

25:12.612 --> 25:15.548
Thousand block of Bienville.

25:15.582 --> 25:17.884
Have Patton see if he could...

25:21.020 --> 25:23.189
Chris.

25:23.222 --> 25:25.224
Think I might have been right.

25:29.629 --> 25:31.631
Wasn't just about me.

25:35.201 --> 25:37.804
Yeah, Militia's
prepping for war.

25:51.684 --> 25:55.888
Whatever the Militia was doing,
they were not expecting you.

25:55.922 --> 25:57.156
Left in a hurry.

25:57.189 --> 25:59.592
BRODY:
Yeah, with plenty of evidence.

25:59.626 --> 26:01.227
This place is a petri dish
of DNA and fingerprints.

26:01.260 --> 26:04.864
M4 carbines and M67
fragmentation grenades,

26:04.897 --> 26:06.065
Army issue.

26:06.098 --> 26:07.900
I've alerted ATF
and Army CID.

26:07.934 --> 26:09.035
We'll see
if these are stolen.

26:09.068 --> 26:11.037
We need to talk.

26:16.743 --> 26:17.710
What the hell
were you thinking?

26:17.744 --> 26:18.711
You were right.

26:18.745 --> 26:20.913
I shouldn't have gone off alone.

26:20.947 --> 26:22.348
You were gonna handle it.

26:22.381 --> 26:23.950
I agreed.

26:23.983 --> 26:25.317
I went rogue. I'm sorry.

26:25.351 --> 26:27.620
I had this, Dwayne.

26:27.654 --> 26:30.623
Slow and methodical is good
in a lot of ways, Karen.

26:30.657 --> 26:32.224
Yeah, I prefer
the word "thoughtful."

26:32.258 --> 26:34.226
Fair enough. Thoughtful.

26:34.260 --> 26:37.029
But like you say,
we do things different.

26:37.063 --> 26:39.231
And if I hadn't
followed Spooner,

26:39.265 --> 26:40.867
we would have missed
all of this.

26:40.900 --> 26:42.802
Oh, okay, okay.

26:44.871 --> 26:47.073
But, friend to friend,
down the road,

26:47.106 --> 26:48.908
your methods are gonna
bite you in the ass.

26:48.941 --> 26:50.910
Yeah, well, I'll worry about
"down the road" down the road.

26:50.943 --> 26:52.144
LASALLE:
Hey, King.

26:52.178 --> 26:55.014
NOPD found these.

26:57.083 --> 26:58.117
HARDY: Militia's been
watching these men

26:58.150 --> 26:59.952
like they've been
watching you.

26:59.986 --> 27:01.353
Yeah, well, whoever they are,
they're targets.

27:01.387 --> 27:03.022
We need to I.D.
them right now.

27:17.069 --> 27:19.672
:
Come in.

27:19.706 --> 27:21.307
I followed your instructions.

27:21.340 --> 27:26.145
Took the streetcar to the end
of the line, doubled back.

27:26.178 --> 27:27.980
Ooh, I think we're
in the clear.

27:29.181 --> 27:31.150
What'd you bring?
Breakfast.

27:31.183 --> 27:32.785
Hey.

27:35.054 --> 27:37.023
Oh. Hi, Loretta.

27:37.056 --> 27:38.858
Oh, hello, sweetheart.

27:43.262 --> 27:45.832
I was hoping you were my dad.

27:45.865 --> 27:47.066
Well, he would have
been here if he could,

27:47.099 --> 27:49.468
but he sent me instead
to show you this.

27:49.501 --> 27:52.705
It's the final autopsy
on Reggie Clifton.

27:55.474 --> 27:58.077
What's it mean?

27:58.110 --> 27:59.278
Well, Mr. Clifton
had unstable levels

27:59.311 --> 28:01.113
of adrenaline
in his blood system.

28:01.147 --> 28:05.151
Built up over months, it caused
an inevitable cardiac event.

28:05.184 --> 28:07.820
Okay.

28:09.822 --> 28:13.993
Whether you hit him or not,
he was going to die.

28:14.026 --> 28:15.995
You're not
a killer, Laurel.

28:16.028 --> 28:18.998
Really?

28:19.031 --> 28:21.467
Well, that's...
that's good, I guess.

28:21.500 --> 28:25.071
Whoa, I-I thought this was
gonna make you feel better.

28:25.104 --> 28:28.074
I'll feel better
when I know my dad's safe.

28:28.107 --> 28:31.110
Oh, we all will,
darling.

28:35.915 --> 28:38.184
PRIDE:
Six unidentified men.

28:38.217 --> 28:40.319
All who seem to be targeted
by the Militia.

28:40.352 --> 28:42.388
No closer
to identifying them.

28:42.421 --> 28:44.390
But we gathered
enough DNA and fingerprints

28:44.423 --> 28:47.026
for Sebastian to I.D.
Spooner's associates

28:47.059 --> 28:48.227
at the abandoned building.

28:48.260 --> 28:50.863
Now, Troy Spooner, we know.

28:50.897 --> 28:52.064
The other three are
all violent criminals,

28:52.098 --> 28:54.100
all affiliated with the Militia.

28:54.133 --> 28:56.102
That doesn't make sense.

28:56.135 --> 28:58.905
The Militia's
leadership is gone

28:58.938 --> 29:01.107
or, like Zed Hastings,
rotting in a cell.

29:01.140 --> 29:04.143
Bank accounts frozen, property
seized by the government.

29:04.176 --> 29:05.978
So how'd they come up
with the resources

29:06.012 --> 29:07.814
for all this high-tech
surveillance equipment?

29:07.847 --> 29:11.217
Never fear,
Triple P is here.

29:11.250 --> 29:14.220
I spent the evening
with a precocious cabernet

29:14.253 --> 29:16.455
and the surveillance van's
hard drive.

29:16.488 --> 29:18.457
Mmm, an irresistible
combination.

29:18.490 --> 29:20.292
Well, whoever was
surveilling you

29:20.326 --> 29:21.928
sent the data somewhere else.

29:21.961 --> 29:24.530
I was able to trace the signal,

29:24.563 --> 29:27.299
find the recipient's
general location.

29:27.333 --> 29:28.835
Syria.

29:28.868 --> 29:30.837
That's unexpected.

29:30.870 --> 29:32.471
When we took down
the Militia the first time,

29:32.504 --> 29:35.007
we learned they had ties
to foreign groups

29:35.041 --> 29:38.210
with a shared interest
of disrupting our military.

29:38.244 --> 29:39.812
Why would the Syrians care
about a couple

29:39.846 --> 29:41.213
of federal agents
from New Orleans?

29:41.247 --> 29:43.249
I just spoke with the Army CID.

29:43.282 --> 29:45.417
The weapons and ammo that we
found in the abandoned building

29:45.451 --> 29:47.253
were stolen from Fort Rucker
three months ago.

29:47.286 --> 29:49.121
Any suspects?

29:49.155 --> 29:51.390
A corporal that was stationed
at the base. Had Militia ties.

29:51.423 --> 29:54.393
But the CID never had enough
to charge him.

29:54.426 --> 29:56.162
His lawyer made sure of that.

29:56.195 --> 29:59.031
Who's his lawyer?

29:59.065 --> 30:02.001
I'm not quite sure why I'm here.

30:02.034 --> 30:03.002
Fort Rucker.

30:03.035 --> 30:04.203
Arsenal robbery.

30:04.236 --> 30:06.973
Weapons, ammo, explosives.

30:07.006 --> 30:08.607
You represent the main suspect.

30:08.640 --> 30:10.176
Got him released from custody.

30:10.209 --> 30:11.610
I'm a defense lawyer.

30:11.643 --> 30:13.212
It's the job.

30:13.245 --> 30:14.446
You also have a history

30:14.480 --> 30:16.315
of defending members
of the Militia.

30:16.348 --> 30:17.950
You're counsel of record

30:17.984 --> 30:20.019
on a dozen of
their outstanding cases.

30:20.052 --> 30:22.188
Including Troy Spooner and the
three men he's on the run with.

30:22.221 --> 30:24.623
Everyone is entitled
to defense.

30:35.101 --> 30:37.069
What am I looking at?

30:37.103 --> 30:38.938
Targets. Innocent men.

30:41.407 --> 30:43.509
Likely being hunted
by your clients right now.

30:43.542 --> 30:47.113
So arrest my clients.

30:47.146 --> 30:48.147
Don't know where they are.

30:48.180 --> 30:50.282
You're gonna help us find 'em.

30:52.251 --> 30:55.888
Even if I wanted to,
which I don't, I'd be disbarred.

30:55.922 --> 30:58.290
We're not talking
to you as counsel.

30:58.324 --> 31:00.192
We're talking to you
as an accessory.

31:00.226 --> 31:02.128
PRIDE:
You alibied Troy Spooner out

31:02.161 --> 31:04.964
the morning my daughter was
attacked, said he was with you.

31:04.997 --> 31:06.966
You arrived
at his shop that morning,

31:06.999 --> 31:09.201
went into his office,
but we have a witness

31:09.235 --> 31:11.603
who says Spooner
was never there.

31:13.272 --> 31:14.640
Who told you that?

31:14.673 --> 31:17.643
This is more than disbarment.

31:17.676 --> 31:21.280
You're aiding and abetting
wanted fugitives.

31:21.313 --> 31:24.116
That's ten years
federal time, minimum.

31:28.154 --> 31:31.323
These men are in danger.

31:31.357 --> 31:33.325
You can save 'em.

31:33.359 --> 31:36.929
Yeah.

31:36.963 --> 31:38.965
And who's gonna save me?

31:41.333 --> 31:44.136
They're doing it to me too.

31:46.705 --> 31:50.676
I was assigned to Spooner
through Legal Aid months ago.

31:50.709 --> 31:55.281
Others showed up at my office.

31:55.314 --> 31:58.117
They got their hooks in me.

31:58.150 --> 32:01.253
They forced me to lie,
or they'll kill me.

32:01.287 --> 32:02.688
Do you know where they are now?

32:02.721 --> 32:06.292
I have no idea.

32:06.325 --> 32:09.161
But they definitely
know where I am.

32:10.562 --> 32:12.531
Okay, well, I think I've got
something here. From a distance,

32:12.564 --> 32:14.967
these look like regular guys
you'd see on the street, right?

32:15.001 --> 32:17.069
LASALLE:
Yeah, a little hairier than
most, but I see what you mean.

32:17.103 --> 32:19.571
Okay, but then you zoom
in a little closer...

32:19.605 --> 32:23.009
you see a watch
on a wrist...

32:23.042 --> 32:27.179
tattoo on an arm...
emblem on a shirt.

32:27.213 --> 32:29.748
Yeah, they're Navy.
Yeah, except, like you said,
they've got beards,

32:29.781 --> 32:32.518
and their haircuts
are definitely not regulation.

32:32.551 --> 32:34.053
Yeah, kind of like
they've been in the woods

32:34.086 --> 32:35.554
for the past six months.
Like they've been trained

32:35.587 --> 32:36.722
to look this way.

32:36.755 --> 32:38.724
Special Forces?
SEALs.

32:38.757 --> 32:40.759
That's why facial recognition
didn't work.

32:40.792 --> 32:42.661
Their identities
are compartmented.

32:42.694 --> 32:44.096
The Militia knows
who they are.

32:44.130 --> 32:45.731
They seem to want them dead.

32:45.764 --> 32:47.733
Yeah, well, somebody's
pulling strings around here,

32:47.766 --> 32:49.568
and I guarantee
it is not Troy Spooner.

32:49.601 --> 32:52.071
Yeah, no, he's a foot soldier,
not a field commander.

32:52.104 --> 32:54.106
Time to pay a visit
to the general.

32:59.678 --> 33:01.647
PRIDE:
Militia's been busy.

33:01.680 --> 33:05.651
Surveilling me, my team,

33:05.684 --> 33:08.687
these six men,
who appear to be Navy.

33:11.557 --> 33:13.359
I would suggest
you start talking.

33:13.392 --> 33:16.362
Take up arms
for a corrupt government--

33:16.395 --> 33:19.798
like these men, like you--

33:19.831 --> 33:21.733
a price will be exacted.

33:23.802 --> 33:25.637
I can exact a price
from you, Zed.

33:25.671 --> 33:28.640
I'm already in prison
the rest of my life.

33:28.674 --> 33:31.143
Thanks to you.

33:31.177 --> 33:33.545
Which means
all bets are off.

33:33.579 --> 33:36.215
You went after my daughter.

33:36.248 --> 33:38.117
Well, this is war.

33:39.751 --> 33:42.788
All's fair.

33:42.821 --> 33:45.724
How is Laurel, by the way?

33:45.757 --> 33:49.728
There are worse places than
this prison I can send you,

33:49.761 --> 33:52.131
where you won't see daylight
for the rest of your life.

33:52.164 --> 33:54.566
Oh, man, I got a light
inside of me,

33:54.600 --> 33:56.135
and it shines bright.

33:57.603 --> 34:00.406
Do your worst.

34:00.439 --> 34:02.774
We'll see how it all
shakes out in the end.

34:05.177 --> 34:07.146
Just finished
searching his cell.

34:07.179 --> 34:09.815
Found this inside a hollowed-out
roll of toilet paper.

34:11.517 --> 34:13.319
Received a text two days ago.

34:13.352 --> 34:16.188
No message, just a photo.

34:18.690 --> 34:21.760
BRODY:
Petty Officer Nelson Peal.

34:21.793 --> 34:23.662
Our missing sailor
from the Belle Chasse break-in.

34:23.695 --> 34:26.232
Most likely at the bottom
of the river by now.

34:26.265 --> 34:27.799
Photo's proof of death.

34:27.833 --> 34:30.236
We've been working
the Nelson Peal case for days.

34:30.269 --> 34:33.305
Actually you stopped working it
moment Laurel was attacked.

34:33.339 --> 34:36.775
Militia wanted to distract me
from this case.

34:36.808 --> 34:39.145
Yeah, but the hard drives that
were stolen from Belle Chasse

34:39.178 --> 34:41.147
didn't have any classified
material on them.

34:41.180 --> 34:42.581
LASALLE:
No.

34:42.614 --> 34:44.750
But Petty Officer Peal's
a computer technician,

34:44.783 --> 34:46.852
All right?
Top secret clearance.

34:46.885 --> 34:49.421
He does maintenance on networks
and several bases,

34:49.455 --> 34:51.723
including
the Stennis Space Center.

34:51.757 --> 34:52.858
Yeah, where the SEALs train.

34:52.891 --> 34:54.326
Yep, Peal had access

34:54.360 --> 34:56.595
to the SEALs' personnel files.

34:56.628 --> 34:57.896
So, what-- Militia grabs him,

34:57.929 --> 35:00.199
forces him to give up
his login information?

35:00.232 --> 35:01.833
PATTON:
That's exactly what happened.

35:01.867 --> 35:04.436
Petty Officer Peal's login
was accessed yesterday.

35:04.470 --> 35:07.173
Bunch of top secret files
downloaded.

35:07.206 --> 35:08.607
Like, thousands of them.

35:08.640 --> 35:09.908
All concerning

35:09.941 --> 35:11.577
a top secret mission in Syria,

35:11.610 --> 35:13.579
where six SEALs took out
a mercenary leader.

35:13.612 --> 35:16.848
You got the service records
on these SEALs?

35:16.882 --> 35:19.585
BRODY:
Same men the Militia targeted.

35:19.618 --> 35:20.686
Was this some kind
of retribution

35:20.719 --> 35:22.254
for the attack in Syria?

35:22.288 --> 35:23.855
Yeah, we'll find out as soon
as we locate the SEALs

35:23.889 --> 35:25.357
and get them protected.

35:25.391 --> 35:26.458
The SEALs are due to appear

35:26.492 --> 35:27.859
at a secret awards ceremony

35:27.893 --> 35:30.162
to receive commendations
for their bravery.

35:30.196 --> 35:30.862
That's where
the Militia's gonna strike.

35:30.896 --> 35:31.863
When's that ceremony?

35:31.897 --> 35:33.131
This afternoon.

35:44.610 --> 35:45.744
HARDY:
Getting the runaround.

35:45.777 --> 35:47.246
SEAL commander's telling me

35:47.279 --> 35:48.914
the medal ceremony's
at a classified location.

35:48.947 --> 35:50.916
Have to be read in.
Got to find a JSOC.

35:50.949 --> 35:53.219
Might be able to help.
Patton?

35:53.252 --> 35:55.287
I've been scanning Navy
documents the Militia stole

35:55.321 --> 35:56.388
for a while.

35:56.422 --> 35:57.856
Location's in there somewhere.

35:57.889 --> 35:59.691
We're running out of time here.
We need to know now.

35:59.725 --> 36:01.793
You can be damn sure
Spooner and the Militia know

36:01.827 --> 36:03.729
exactly where the ceremony is,
and they're about to hit it.

36:03.762 --> 36:06.432
Got it!
VFW building in Gretna.

36:06.465 --> 36:07.766
Let's go.

36:31.857 --> 36:34.926
*

36:41.633 --> 36:43.835
Local LEO's, Federal marshals

36:43.869 --> 36:45.671
and FBI scrambling now.

36:45.704 --> 36:46.872
Ten minutes out.

36:46.905 --> 36:48.540
We're gonna need
all the backup we can get.

36:48.574 --> 36:50.809
Don't know
what we're walking into.

37:13.732 --> 37:16.001
OFFICER:
Detail...

37:16.034 --> 37:18.704
salute!

37:20.939 --> 37:22.374
Damn it, it's a trap!
Go! Go! Go! Go!

37:22.408 --> 37:24.710
Let's get the hell out of here!

37:25.944 --> 37:28.046
PRIDE:
Federal agents, freeze!

37:28.079 --> 37:29.948
Put your weapons
down now!

37:34.353 --> 37:35.521
You got 30 guns on you.

37:35.554 --> 37:37.789
Look around.

37:37.823 --> 37:39.425
You don't have a chance.

37:43.028 --> 37:43.962
Easy!

37:47.599 --> 37:48.734
Spooner?

37:48.767 --> 37:51.403
You really want
to die here today?

37:51.437 --> 37:53.672
It's over.

38:09.388 --> 38:10.589
Stay on your knees!

38:10.622 --> 38:11.823
Rest of you,
get down on the ground!

38:11.857 --> 38:13.359
Hands up!

38:16.362 --> 38:19.297
Cross your ankles!

38:23.369 --> 38:26.338
Just heard
from our pal at JSOC.

38:26.372 --> 38:27.906
Got the SEALs
transferred safely.

38:27.939 --> 38:29.808
Good work, Hardy.

38:29.841 --> 38:33.679
Not too methodical
for you?

38:33.712 --> 38:35.814
It'll do for today.

38:46.958 --> 38:48.093
Wanted to look you in the eye

38:48.126 --> 38:49.861
to tell you that

38:49.895 --> 38:52.698
six Navy SEALs were awarded

38:52.731 --> 38:55.434
commendations for bravery today.

38:55.467 --> 38:57.803
And your men
were arrested.

38:57.836 --> 39:00.939
They'll be relocating
to this prison soon.

39:00.972 --> 39:03.709
Well, I guess I'll have
some company.

39:03.742 --> 39:04.876
No, Zed.

39:04.910 --> 39:06.144
You won't.

39:06.177 --> 39:07.513
You made

39:07.546 --> 39:09.515
a deal with Syrian militants.

39:09.548 --> 39:12.117
They promised
to pay you handsomely

39:12.150 --> 39:15.086
if you took out the SEALs
who took down their commander.

39:15.120 --> 39:17.889
Enemy of my enemy.

39:19.725 --> 39:21.927
That's not an admission,
by the way.

39:21.960 --> 39:24.963
I don't need
your confession.

39:24.996 --> 39:28.900
Troy Spooner and the others

39:28.934 --> 39:32.704
are spilling their guts.

39:32.738 --> 39:36.174
Trying to save
themselves from...

39:36.207 --> 39:39.077
this, I guess.

39:43.982 --> 39:45.951
Official transfer orders
to ADX Florence.

39:45.984 --> 39:47.986
Supermax.

39:53.592 --> 39:55.160
You come after my people,

39:55.193 --> 39:59.164
try to use my daughter,

39:59.197 --> 40:01.467
we're gonna take you down.

40:03.034 --> 40:04.970
Militia's finished.

40:05.003 --> 40:07.439
You are the leader

40:07.473 --> 40:09.475
of nothing.

40:11.877 --> 40:14.946
Whoever said I was the leader?

40:18.183 --> 40:20.752
Almost finished up here.

40:20.786 --> 40:23.054
Percy's bringing Laurel
back to Pride's bar.

40:23.088 --> 40:24.923
Gonna meet him there.
You should join.

40:24.956 --> 40:27.058
Sure.

40:27.092 --> 40:29.895
Think there's something off with
these Militia member statements?

40:29.928 --> 40:32.464
They're all saying
the same thing.

40:32.498 --> 40:36.468
They received instructions by
text from an untraceable phone.

40:36.502 --> 40:39.037
Never had direct contact
with Zed.

40:39.070 --> 40:40.539
Yeah, that's what bothers me.

40:40.572 --> 40:42.173
Phone we confiscated
from his prison cell

40:42.207 --> 40:44.476
was smuggled
in a couple days ago.

40:44.510 --> 40:46.111
Yeah, and all we found
was a single photo on it.

40:46.144 --> 40:48.947
No way he was calling
the shots on this operation.

40:48.980 --> 40:50.682
Just got off the phone
with Pride.

40:50.716 --> 40:52.751
He thinks we're still in danger.
Heading back now.

41:12.704 --> 41:14.005
You okay in there?

41:18.076 --> 41:19.878
Who are you?

41:19.911 --> 41:22.147
Friend of the family.

41:22.180 --> 41:23.515
What do you want?

41:23.549 --> 41:25.517
What do you
think I want?

41:25.551 --> 41:27.152
To kidnap me?

41:27.185 --> 41:30.722
That was the plan.

41:30.756 --> 41:33.058
But you surprised us.

41:34.092 --> 41:35.927
You're a lot like your father.

41:35.961 --> 41:37.128
You're smart.

41:37.162 --> 41:39.030
And a fighter.

41:39.064 --> 41:40.298
But this is war.

41:40.331 --> 41:41.800
You were gonna
be collateral.

41:41.833 --> 41:44.002
But now you're gonna be

41:44.035 --> 41:45.503
a message to--

41:47.105 --> 41:49.107
Laurel down!

41:59.951 --> 42:01.787
You're safe now.

42:01.820 --> 42:03.889
You're safe.

42:05.190 --> 42:07.893
Is it over?

42:09.327 --> 42:12.297
Yeah, it's over.

42:27.112 --> 42:28.980
Told you.

42:29.014 --> 42:31.016
I got this.
