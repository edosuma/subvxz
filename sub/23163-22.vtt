WEBVTT

00:00.718 --> 00:03.312
You can't die. You have to
take care of our daughter.

00:05.022 --> 00:07.217
Thomas.
It's good to see you again.

00:07.291 --> 00:09.282
I should've known you and him
were going to get together.

00:09.360 --> 00:11.260
<i>I mean, you just had to...
T. C., stop it!</i>

00:11.329 --> 00:12.762
That's not why I'm here.

00:12.830 --> 00:16.664
She came here to talk to me and I'm
going to find out what she has to say.

00:16.734 --> 00:18.565
Does anybody know
anything about this guy?

00:18.636 --> 00:21.935
Operatives know Michelle's on the
island and they know where she's staying.

00:22.006 --> 00:24.702
<i>I love you, Michelle. More
than anyone I've ever known.</i>

06:08.452 --> 06:09.441
Rick?

06:10.621 --> 06:11.610
Carmella?

06:18.495 --> 06:19.553
Mac?

06:20.965 --> 06:23.866
<i>Hey, Magnum, great to see you!</i>

06:23.934 --> 06:25.834
<i>Hey, you want some ice cream?</i>

06:26.670 --> 06:29.503
<i>I'd like a beer, if I could
get one. Where is everybody?</i>

06:29.573 --> 06:32.440
<i>You really ought to try this ice
cream. I'm telling you, it's heaven.</i>

06:32.509 --> 06:33.669
What're you doing here?

06:33.744 --> 06:34.870
Waiting for you.

06:34.945 --> 06:37.106
Me? What made you think
I was gonna be here?

06:37.248 --> 06:39.079
Everybody comes
through here eventually.

06:39.149 --> 06:40.582
Oh! You wanted a beer.

06:40.651 --> 06:42.642
You won't believe
what happened to me.

06:43.420 --> 06:44.512
Yeah.

06:44.588 --> 06:46.317
I have been
feeling so good lately.

06:46.390 --> 06:47.857
<i>I've been paying off old debts,</i>

06:47.925 --> 06:49.256
I'm down in
the warehouse district

06:49.326 --> 06:50.918
checking on some parts
for T.C.'s chopper...

06:50.995 --> 06:52.587
Did you shave off your mustache?

06:52.663 --> 06:54.324
What happened in the warehouse?

06:54.465 --> 06:55.830
Yeah...

06:56.200 --> 06:58.532
<i>Well, these guys
started following me.</i>

06:58.602 --> 07:01.070
<i>I don't know who they were
or why they were tailing me,</i>

07:01.138 --> 07:02.799
but luckily I had
my gun in the car.

07:02.873 --> 07:04.033
You'd have been even luckier

07:04.108 --> 07:06.167
if you'd have taken along a
couple of extra magazines for it.

07:06.243 --> 07:07.835
<i>Well, yeah, when I got down...</i>

07:08.012 --> 07:09.536
How do you know that I didn't?

07:09.613 --> 07:12.582
<i>Well, that doesn't matter. Now, you
say these guys were following you?</i>

07:12.650 --> 07:15.084
<i>Yeah. Anyway,
here I am in this firefight,</i>

07:15.152 --> 07:16.949
I'm down to my
last couple of rounds.

07:17.021 --> 07:19.046
<i>I decided to make a break
for the door, you know,</i>

07:19.123 --> 07:20.954
figuring the best defense
is a good offense.

07:21.025 --> 07:22.754
I've done that dozens of times.

07:23.394 --> 07:25.157
<i>You have to, in my line of work.</i>

07:26.063 --> 07:29.191
<i>Anyway...
I go out blasting,</i>

07:29.266 --> 07:31.826
<i>I get the guy with
the shotgun, and then...</i>

07:32.770 --> 07:34.032
And then?

07:35.572 --> 07:38.666
I'm not sure.
I don't know.

07:39.443 --> 07:40.933
<i>Well, don't let it bother you.</i>

07:41.011 --> 07:42.376
It's perfectly natural at first.

07:42.446 --> 07:45.472
Start again at the part where they
had you cornered in the warehouse?

07:45.549 --> 07:46.914
I didn't say they
had me cornered.

07:46.984 --> 07:48.076
Whatever.

07:48.152 --> 07:49.414
How do you know all this?

07:49.486 --> 07:51.386
Old DÃ¼sseldorf in a long neck.

07:52.790 --> 07:54.257
<i>You know, I never even heard of this stuff</i>

07:54.325 --> 07:55.883
till that night at Luau Louie's.

07:56.960 --> 07:59.155
<i>Boy, did we have
a good time that night, huh?</i>

07:59.229 --> 08:02.096
<i>Well, up to the point where your
Ferrari blew up with me in it.</i>

08:02.166 --> 08:03.360
<i>Oh, no.</i>

08:03.434 --> 08:06.130
<i>No, you're not
going to do this to me.</i>

08:06.203 --> 08:09.730
<i>You can't shave off your mustache
and make me think you're Mac,</i>

08:09.807 --> 08:10.967
the real Mac.

08:11.041 --> 08:13.509
<i>Well, yeah, I call you Mac,
but you're Jim Bonig.</i>

08:13.577 --> 08:15.010
<i>And I don't know what you want,</i>

08:15.079 --> 08:17.138
<i>but it's not gonna work,
and it's not funny!</i>

08:17.214 --> 08:18.841
Ha! You're telling me!

08:19.883 --> 08:21.874
<i>I was there one minute,
then I wasn't.</i>

08:21.952 --> 08:23.476
What's going on?

08:25.489 --> 08:26.751
Life.

08:26.824 --> 08:28.121
For some people.

08:28.192 --> 08:31.093
Like two of those guys you
fought it out with this morning.

08:35.599 --> 08:38.500
<i>If they're alive,
and you're the real Mac,</i>

08:38.568 --> 08:41.663
<i>and you're not alive,
you're telling me I'm...</i>

08:50.514 --> 08:51.776
I get it.

08:53.884 --> 08:56.352
I'm dreaming.
I always tend to do this

08:56.453 --> 08:58.444
when I'm full of anticipation
about something.

08:58.522 --> 09:01.514
<i>Well, never mind, because
I couldn't be not dreaming.</i>

09:01.592 --> 09:03.184
The timing would be all wrong.

09:03.827 --> 09:06.625
I've never met anybody yet who
thought the timing was right.

09:07.331 --> 09:08.730
Who were you expecting?

09:08.799 --> 09:11.131
<i>If you were really
the old Mac, you'd know.</i>

09:12.002 --> 09:13.993
<i>Now, that really makes me nuts.</i>

09:14.071 --> 09:18.371
<i>Why is it that people always
think that when people are gone,</i>

09:18.442 --> 09:20.376
they know everything?
I don't know.

09:20.444 --> 09:24.346
<i>Good. Well, I've really
kind of enjoyed this in a way,</i>

09:24.415 --> 09:26.212
but I have to wake up now.

09:26.283 --> 09:27.614
<i>Bye, Mac.</i>

09:29.853 --> 09:32.321
He arose quite
early this morning.

09:32.489 --> 09:36.255
<i>I tracked him down to the beach
shortly after sunrise, where I</i>

09:37.194 --> 09:40.186
reprimanded him for forgetting
to have the Ferrari serviced.

09:43.100 --> 09:44.465
<i>Forget it, Higgins.</i>

09:44.535 --> 09:47.436
You couldn't have known it'd be
the last time you'd talk to him.

09:47.504 --> 09:48.528
No.

09:49.940 --> 09:52.807
I mention the incident only
because of his unusual mood.

09:52.876 --> 09:56.175
An air of complete
calm tranquility.

09:57.614 --> 10:00.014
Most odd for Magnum
in the morning hours.

10:02.119 --> 10:04.280
<i>It's a phenomenon
that happens, you know.</i>

10:04.521 --> 10:05.749
Lincoln...

10:06.657 --> 10:08.318
People who were with him

10:08.559 --> 10:11.756
that day all talked about how he
seemed to know what was coming.

10:13.530 --> 10:15.327
And how he was at peace with it.

10:16.133 --> 10:18.363
He say anything about a
case he was working on?

10:18.435 --> 10:21.165
<i>No, apparently he had
elected to clear his schedule.</i>

10:21.572 --> 10:22.903
Has anyone told Rick?

10:23.474 --> 10:26.375
Oh. I'll go to the prison this afternoon.

10:27.211 --> 10:30.578
<i>I may have some good news for him
about the weapons charge, but...</i>

10:30.848 --> 10:32.839
Now when he hears about this...

10:33.283 --> 10:35.911
It's hit us all very hard.

10:36.119 --> 10:37.279
Higgins?

10:37.354 --> 10:39.652
<i>I have to talk to you
about something. Hi, guys.</i>

10:39.723 --> 10:40.883
What's everybody doing here?

10:40.958 --> 10:43.825
I have no idea what to tell
his guest when she arrives.

10:43.894 --> 10:46.055
<i>Higgins, I asked you
not to mention it to anybody.</i>

10:46.129 --> 10:47.118
What guest?

10:47.197 --> 10:48.858
<i>He can't tell you, Carol.
It's confidential.</i>

10:48.932 --> 10:50.729
A Miss Barrington.
She's due any moment.

10:50.801 --> 10:52.029
Higgins!

10:52.135 --> 10:54.126
I think I should stick
around and talk to her.

10:54.204 --> 10:55.933
She may have something to do
with what happened.

10:57.441 --> 11:00.069
What happened to "I am the
very soul of discretion"?

11:00.143 --> 11:03.078
<i>Yes? What happened to, "You
may depend on my silence"?</i>

11:03.146 --> 11:05.478
<i>A Miss Barrington to see
Thomas Magnum.</i>

11:05.549 --> 11:06.880
All right.

11:07.317 --> 11:09.808
<i>You can't all go on
ignoring me forever, you know.</i>

11:11.455 --> 11:14.151
This is turning out to be
the worst dream I've ever had.

11:14.224 --> 11:15.350
If you'll excuse me.

11:15.425 --> 11:17.086
I'll take care of it.

11:20.097 --> 11:21.359
<i>Lads, what is it?</i>

11:21.431 --> 11:24.366
<i>Well, thank God. At least somebody
knows I'm here. Keep it up, guys.</i>

11:26.069 --> 11:27.559
<i>Zeus, Apollo, heel.</i>

11:27.671 --> 11:30.105
<i>Jonathan,
can't you make them stop?</i>

11:30.173 --> 11:32.368
Apparently not.
I'll admit Miss Barrington.

11:32.442 --> 11:34.000
<i>Higgins, no!</i>

11:37.514 --> 11:38.503
<i>Yes, I'm coming.</i>

11:41.919 --> 11:43.216
Michelle.

11:47.724 --> 11:49.157
You're Miss Barrington.

11:50.661 --> 11:53.186
<i>Uh, come in. Come in.</i>

11:57.601 --> 11:59.125
Thomas didn't tell you?

11:59.202 --> 12:02.399
<i>No, no. Only that a Miss
Barrington would be arriving.</i>

12:02.639 --> 12:06.131
<i>Well, of course, he would do nothing
to jeopardize your safety by...</i>

12:08.245 --> 12:10.145
Something has happened.
What's wrong?

12:11.915 --> 12:13.348
It's Thomas?

12:13.550 --> 12:15.518
There's been an accident.

12:16.219 --> 12:17.481
A shooting.

12:21.391 --> 12:22.983
I'm terribly sorry.

12:31.101 --> 12:34.537
<i>I'm quite certain there are
several children's books in French,</i>

12:35.005 --> 12:37.906
which Magnum kept after
you and your mother left.

12:43.513 --> 12:45.674
Although finding
anything in this junk heap

12:45.749 --> 12:47.876
Magnum refers to as a closet...

12:49.786 --> 12:50.775
Odd.

12:52.289 --> 12:53.881
Everything's all tidy.

12:55.325 --> 12:56.883
You don't suppose...

13:02.599 --> 13:03.588
Hi.

13:07.371 --> 13:09.396
<i>I guess you can't
see me either, huh?</i>

13:12.242 --> 13:14.073
<i>Well, it's good to see
you again.</i>

13:18.915 --> 13:20.746
<i>I wonder if you'd remember me,</i>

13:21.618 --> 13:23.415
if you could see me
I bet you would.

13:23.487 --> 13:26.456
<i>We had a pretty good time when
you were here before, remember?</i>

13:29.059 --> 13:30.890
<i>You lost your two
front teeth, huh?</i>

13:32.996 --> 13:34.691
You look just like I did when...

13:40.337 --> 13:41.565
Look...

13:43.140 --> 13:44.937
I want you to do me a favor.

13:46.910 --> 13:48.741
I want you to think about me.

13:49.479 --> 13:51.947
<i>Just think about Thomas, okay?</i>

13:53.216 --> 13:54.808
<i>See, I have this feeling</i>

13:56.219 --> 13:57.743
that you could see me

13:58.922 --> 14:00.446
if you tried real hard.

14:01.591 --> 14:02.956
Wouldn't you like that?

14:05.662 --> 14:08.790
<i>So let's do it like a game,
all right? I'll close my eyes...</i>

14:11.234 --> 14:13.293
And I'll think of
nothing but you...

14:16.473 --> 14:19.033
And that's gonna
make you think about me...

14:21.178 --> 14:23.078
And then you'll see me.

14:25.248 --> 14:26.237
Okay?

14:27.684 --> 14:28.912
You ready?

14:48.371 --> 14:49.736
Thomas.

15:09.826 --> 15:11.259
Here we are.

15:17.367 --> 15:18.891
This should do.

15:31.181 --> 15:33.809
I don't know exactly how
to tell you where Thomas is.

15:34.651 --> 15:36.118
I wish I did.

15:41.858 --> 15:43.655
I should have
known you were coming.

15:43.727 --> 15:45.957
That's why Thomas
was acting so strange.

15:46.029 --> 15:48.827
<i>I mean, paying off old debts,
wrapping up old business.</i>

15:48.899 --> 15:50.230
He was gonna leave with you.

15:50.300 --> 15:51.995
<i>That was it, wasn't it?
T. C...</i>

15:52.068 --> 15:53.626
The Navy was gonna make him

15:53.703 --> 15:55.637
part of the witness
relocation program.

15:55.705 --> 15:57.764
<i>That's why he couldn't
talk about it. No, he...</i>

15:57.841 --> 15:59.206
<i>I didn't...
You know,</i>

15:59.276 --> 16:01.267
I should've known you and him
were going to get together.

16:01.344 --> 16:03.744
<i>I mean, you just had to...
T. C., stop it!</i>

16:06.149 --> 16:08.117
That's not why I'm here.

16:10.520 --> 16:12.112
<i>Well, why are you here?</i>

16:13.990 --> 16:15.958
I had to talk to Thomas.

16:17.227 --> 16:19.286
There was something
I had to tell him.

16:19.396 --> 16:21.091
You came out of hiding

16:21.631 --> 16:25.226
<i>and risked your life, not to
mention Lily's, just to say hello?</i>

16:27.537 --> 16:29.869
What difference
does it make now?

16:38.148 --> 16:39.581
It's okay...

16:41.218 --> 16:43.880
<i>No, it isn't.</i>

16:44.654 --> 16:45.916
It isn't.

16:46.690 --> 16:47.987
<i>Yeah, I know.</i>

16:52.362 --> 16:53.761
I'm all right now.

16:56.666 --> 16:59.499
I better see about gettin'
you and Lily on a plane.

17:16.619 --> 17:17.882
Well?

17:20.457 --> 17:21.856
<i>Well, what?</i>

17:23.326 --> 17:24.520
Ready to leave?

17:24.594 --> 17:26.686
<i>Well, I'm a little busy
right now.</i>

17:26.762 --> 17:29.630
<i>If you're not dead, how come
nobody can see you or hear you?</i>

17:29.699 --> 17:31.860
<i>If I am dead, how come I don't feel like it?</i>

17:31.935 --> 17:33.800
How come I feel like
staying and fighting this?

17:33.870 --> 17:35.132
It's all a part of the process.

17:35.205 --> 17:36.695
<i>No. No, there's
something else.</i>

17:36.773 --> 17:39.765
And I'm not just gonna fold up
and go away because you say so.

17:41.177 --> 17:42.542
Tell me something.

17:42.612 --> 17:45.410
How come you didn't go after
Michelle just now?

17:45.482 --> 17:47.382
How come you
didn't try to hug her?

17:47.450 --> 17:49.975
Or the little girl...
Weren't you glad to see her?

17:55.425 --> 17:57.290
I wanted to hold her.

18:00.697 --> 18:02.528
I guess I was just afraid.

18:03.400 --> 18:05.391
Of what?
That you're right.

18:06.536 --> 18:09.164
<i>Okay, I'll admit this much,
I'm either dead or dreaming.</i>

18:09.239 --> 18:11.036
<i>Well, that's a start.</i>

18:13.043 --> 18:14.533
Where did that come from?

18:15.712 --> 18:16.701
This?

18:17.247 --> 18:18.908
<i>Oh, I suppose you
brought it to me once</i>

18:18.982 --> 18:20.847
when you needed
a favor on the computer.

18:20.917 --> 18:22.942
<i>Or were going to
bring it, and didn't.</i>

18:23.987 --> 18:26.956
Time has little to do with
infinity and jelly donuts.

18:27.290 --> 18:31.317
<i>Well, she came here to talk to me and
I'm going to find out what she has to say.</i>

18:36.599 --> 18:39.227
Everybody denies it at first.
It's perfectly natural.

18:39.302 --> 18:42.294
The best thing you can do for Michelle
is to let her get on with things.

18:42.372 --> 18:44.101
I let her go before.
I'm not gonna do it again.

18:44.174 --> 18:46.301
You're making things very
difficult. I don't care!

18:46.376 --> 18:48.776
<i>You just have a certain amount
of time to do this, you know.</i>

18:48.845 --> 18:50.540
Do what?
Say goodbye.

19:04.227 --> 19:06.559
<i>Hey, you can't just walk away
from this, you know.</i>

19:06.629 --> 19:08.460
Wait a minute.
You recognize that guy?

19:09.432 --> 19:10.660
Not really.

19:10.734 --> 19:12.326
Who were the men
who were following me?

19:12.402 --> 19:14.927
<i>I told you before, being dead
doesn't mean being omniscient.</i>

19:15.005 --> 19:17.530
<i>Enough of your games, Mac!
I wanna know what you know.</i>

19:17.607 --> 19:19.438
<i>I'm telling you,
I actually had more access</i>

19:19.509 --> 19:22.535
to really secret information
when I was with NIA than I do now.

19:24.180 --> 19:25.807
<i>No, wait! Wait!</i>

19:26.816 --> 19:29.910
I certainly didn't mean to imply
that the Navy knew more than...

19:29.986 --> 19:31.886
I wouldn't even
want it to get out

19:31.955 --> 19:33.582
that I even thought
that they knew...

19:33.890 --> 19:35.084
<i>Hey, wait a minute.</i>

19:35.158 --> 19:36.989
Are we going to
Buck Greene's office?

19:37.060 --> 19:39.255
<i>Hey, wait.
I refuse to be civil</i>

19:39.329 --> 19:40.990
to the man that's
responsible for my death.

19:41.064 --> 19:42.156
I'll make a deal with you.

19:42.232 --> 19:44.359
No deals.
That's part of the deal.

19:44.434 --> 19:47.460
<i>Listen to me, those guys probably
knew Michelle was on her way here.</i>

19:47.537 --> 19:50.631
<i>That's why they shot at me, to get
me out of the way before she got here.</i>

19:50.707 --> 19:54.199
<i>They knew I would never let them get near
her. Now, she could be in real danger.</i>

19:54.277 --> 19:56.541
She could be in worse danger
if you get involved in this.

19:56.613 --> 19:57.671
You just stay out of this.

19:57.747 --> 19:59.772
I have to let somebody
know she's in trouble.

19:59.849 --> 20:00.838
That's all I'm asking.

20:00.917 --> 20:04.045
<i>Just give me enough time to get
through to somebody, that's all.</i>

20:04.254 --> 20:05.687
How much time do you need?

20:06.322 --> 20:07.584
I don't know.

20:07.824 --> 20:10.622
Time has little to do with
infinity and jelly donuts.

20:13.563 --> 20:15.724
<i>Well, I guess I could
look the other way</i>

20:15.999 --> 20:17.330
for a little while.

20:44.527 --> 20:45.755
<i>Hi, Maggie.</i>

20:46.429 --> 20:48.420
Ron? Maggie Poole.

20:48.698 --> 20:52.429
<i>Yeah, yeah, I just got it. Do you
have a name to go with this face?</i>

20:53.336 --> 20:54.496
Durant?

20:54.571 --> 20:56.766
D- U-R-A-N-T?

20:57.507 --> 20:59.998
Edward T.

21:01.544 --> 21:04.012
<i>Thanks, Ron.
It means a lot to me.</i>

21:04.614 --> 21:07.139
<i>No, I can't give you
any more details right now.</i>

21:07.784 --> 21:10.844
All I'm sure of
is that it may be trouble

21:10.920 --> 21:12.911
for somebody that
meant a lot to Thomas.

21:12.989 --> 21:15.924
<i>You're onto them already. I knew
I could count on you, Maggie.</i>

21:16.459 --> 21:18.950
<i>No, I don't... No, I don't
think that's a good idea.</i>

21:19.395 --> 21:21.158
I thought you wanted to help!

21:24.200 --> 21:28.034
<i>All right, fine. Dinner. But not
at your place. At a restaurant.</i>

21:28.104 --> 21:29.332
A crowded restaurant.

21:29.405 --> 21:32.067
<i>Attagirl, Maggie. Don't do
anything you don't wanna do.</i>

21:33.243 --> 21:34.972
<i>All right, your place.
8:00.</i>

21:35.812 --> 21:36.870
Yeah.

21:42.752 --> 21:44.242
<i>Oh, Thomas...</i>

21:46.990 --> 21:48.321
<i>Oh, Maggie...</i>

21:54.697 --> 21:56.790
And you've got confirmation
of the cablegram?

21:56.866 --> 21:58.424
<i>Yes, Colonel Greene.</i>

21:58.501 --> 22:01.368
<i>From Paris, delivered to
Thomas five days ago.</i>

22:01.437 --> 22:03.496
And a K. Barrington
and a C. Barrington

22:03.573 --> 22:06.064
arrived here today
on a flight from Paris.

22:06.176 --> 22:07.973
She brought
the little girl with her?

22:08.044 --> 22:09.170
Yes.

22:09.245 --> 22:12.214
I guess she thought that Lily
would be safer here with her.

22:12.348 --> 22:13.542
Damn it.

22:14.083 --> 22:15.345
He promised.

22:16.152 --> 22:19.144
Magnum gave me his word
he'd let me know

22:19.222 --> 22:21.122
if he had any contact
with Michelle.

22:22.225 --> 22:24.090
This Edward Durant

22:24.494 --> 22:27.588
<i>tried to get the airline to give
him a number for her locally,</i>

22:27.664 --> 22:30.428
and he's been asking around at
some of the hotels about her.

22:30.500 --> 22:33.333
I've alerted them to notify me
if he should inquire further.

22:33.403 --> 22:36.270
Is the Navy paying you
to play private investigator?

22:36.339 --> 22:37.397
I just want to help.

22:37.473 --> 22:39.464
<i>I mean, if this has any
connection to Thomas...</i>

22:39.542 --> 22:42.010
Thomas Magnum
is no longer your concern.

22:45.348 --> 22:47.908
We gave Michelle all the
protection we promised.

22:48.017 --> 22:50.577
<i>We can't help her if she's
gonna go flying around the world,</i>

22:50.653 --> 22:52.814
risking exposure
of her identity.

22:54.624 --> 22:56.285
Thomas was a friend of ours.

23:00.363 --> 23:02.797
Intelligence has no knowledge
of this Durant.

23:02.865 --> 23:04.127
There's no file.

23:04.200 --> 23:06.532
I got that photograph from CIA.

23:06.603 --> 23:09.936
They only know about him because
he's in international trade.

23:10.006 --> 23:13.999
<i>He's a very clean, very respected
businessman, based in Paris.</i>

23:14.077 --> 23:17.012
<i>Now, he is either a brand
new agent or a very good one.</i>

23:23.720 --> 23:24.982
Anything else?

23:26.322 --> 23:28.119
He's at the Carlyle Hotel.

23:29.459 --> 23:30.721
Room 305.

23:57.086 --> 23:58.485
<i>Look, Buck...</i>

24:00.556 --> 24:05.186
I realize we haven't exactly
seen eye to eye over the years.

24:07.597 --> 24:10.225
But I know basically
you're a good man.

24:12.969 --> 24:15.904
<i>I've never asked you
for anything before, ever.</i>

24:17.874 --> 24:20.069
And it's beginning to look like

24:20.143 --> 24:23.704
I'm not gonna get a chance to
ask you for anything ever again.

24:23.780 --> 24:26.112
I'd look after
Michelle myself...

24:28.384 --> 24:30.045
But I just can't right now.

24:32.355 --> 24:33.788
Please listen to me.

24:40.930 --> 24:42.158
What am I doing?

24:43.266 --> 24:46.099
I couldn't communicate with
you when I could communicate.

26:47.089 --> 26:48.681
Michelle!

27:05.675 --> 27:08.200
You promised you wouldn't
follow me to the Islands.

27:08.277 --> 27:10.006
I also promised
I wouldn't worry.

27:10.212 --> 27:12.043
And did you really
think I wouldn't?

27:12.248 --> 27:13.681
You shouldn't have come here.

27:13.749 --> 27:15.774
<i>If they find out you're here,
you could be in danger.</i>

27:15.851 --> 27:18.319
I just wanna take you
home. I can't leave yet.

27:20.456 --> 27:21.923
You haven't talked to Magnum?

27:21.991 --> 27:24.221
<i>Edward, please.</i>

27:25.194 --> 27:26.821
<i>What, is he being difficult?</i>

27:27.229 --> 27:29.925
<i>Or is it just that you're not sure,
now that you've seen him again?</i>

27:29.999 --> 27:31.432
I haven't seen him.

27:33.102 --> 27:35.332
<i>Well, look, if the problem
is some indecision on your...</i>

27:35.404 --> 27:36.632
<i>No, no...</i>

27:37.707 --> 27:39.004
That isn't it.

27:39.308 --> 27:40.832
<i>Well, then what?
What is it?</i>

27:41.844 --> 27:44.278
Don't you know how to tell
him that we're getting married?

27:44.647 --> 27:45.705
Edward...

27:47.583 --> 27:49.312
Do you know that I love you?

27:50.319 --> 27:51.377
Yes.

27:51.721 --> 27:55.623
<i>Then, please, give me some
time to work all this out.</i>

27:56.926 --> 27:57.915
Please.

28:07.870 --> 28:10.065
I'll be at the Carlyle
until tomorrow night.

28:11.340 --> 28:13.968
<i>Now, don't take any chances
you don't have to.</i>

28:30.259 --> 28:31.385
Michelle.

28:36.165 --> 28:37.826
I kind of hoped all along

28:38.601 --> 28:41.900
we just needed a couple
of minutes alone to talk.

28:45.074 --> 28:47.201
But I guess it's too late
for that now.

29:00.589 --> 29:02.181
I don't believe it!

29:02.258 --> 29:03.520
I'm getting out of here?

29:03.592 --> 29:05.492
A few signatures
and it's all over.

29:07.163 --> 29:10.030
<i>Oh, Carol, I don't know how
you pulled it off, but thanks.</i>

29:10.099 --> 29:11.327
I didn't.

29:11.400 --> 29:13.891
Apparently somebody else
has been helping you out.

29:14.036 --> 29:16.436
Look.
Look on the back page here.

29:18.607 --> 29:20.700
A copy of my birth certificate. Mmm-hmm.

29:20.776 --> 29:24.212
<i>And some affidavits from some
residents of Cook County, Illinois,</i>

29:24.280 --> 29:26.840
that swear that
your given name is Orville.

29:27.349 --> 29:30.876
<i>See, the warrant that was sworn out
against you for altering the weapons</i>

29:31.153 --> 29:33.178
<i>was made out to Rick Wright,
not Orville.</i>

29:33.255 --> 29:34.722
And that's enough to spring me?

29:34.790 --> 29:36.724
And overturn the conviction.

29:36.792 --> 29:40.228
<i>It's a technicality that all of
us had overlooked, including me.</i>

29:40.296 --> 29:42.423
<i>Well, somebody caught it.</i>

29:43.299 --> 29:44.357
Yeah.

29:44.800 --> 29:46.825
And that somebody
took all the evidence

29:46.902 --> 29:49.462
down to the courthouse
yesterday morning before he...

29:50.673 --> 29:52.436
Before the shooting.

30:10.726 --> 30:12.956
<i>Gee, I never even got
a chance to thank him.</i>

30:13.128 --> 30:15.926
Forget it.
That's what friends are for.

30:18.834 --> 30:20.131
Listen...

30:21.103 --> 30:23.503
<i>I don't exactly know how
to tell you this,</i>

30:24.874 --> 30:27.035
<i>but I thought I was
having a weird dream,</i>

30:27.576 --> 30:29.806
but it's beginning
to look like...

30:31.580 --> 30:32.569
Well...

30:33.549 --> 30:35.517
Just in case it's not...

30:36.485 --> 30:38.043
I just wanted to say...

30:40.022 --> 30:41.614
I just wanted to say

30:42.091 --> 30:43.991
<i>that I'm really
gonna miss you guys,</i>

30:46.528 --> 30:48.860
and I guess I'll be seeing you.

31:38.213 --> 31:40.909
<i>You know, I never
got a chance to tell you,</i>

31:40.983 --> 31:43.577
<i>I think I understand what it's
like for you to be up here,</i>

31:43.652 --> 31:45.244
<i>above the world, all alone.</i>

31:47.623 --> 31:49.614
You can breathe better.

31:50.459 --> 31:53.223
<i>Slow down a little bit,
get things into focus.</i>

31:53.696 --> 31:56.893
Figure out what it is
you need to do.

31:59.301 --> 32:01.326
There's this place that I...

32:07.910 --> 32:09.844
<i>So, I guess this is</i>

32:11.280 --> 32:14.716
<i>probably the last flight
we're gonna take together,</i>

32:15.584 --> 32:17.051
for a while at least.

32:22.057 --> 32:24.582
I just don't see what
she sees in the guy.

32:24.660 --> 32:26.821
<i>I mean, who is he?</i>

32:26.895 --> 32:29.125
Does anybody know
anything about this guy?

32:29.698 --> 32:32.166
<i>It just bugs me that
she's gonna go off with him,</i>

32:32.234 --> 32:34.498
and I don't get to talk
to her about it.

32:36.305 --> 32:38.466
Most extraordinary.
That's what I think.

32:38.540 --> 32:39.871
What is it?

32:39.942 --> 32:41.569
What is that?

32:41.643 --> 32:43.634
<i>Oh, something
I felt like playing.</i>

32:43.712 --> 32:45.407
I don't really quite know why.

32:49.284 --> 32:51.514
I've just received
a generous advance

32:51.587 --> 32:54.420
from the Remington-Lordes
publishing house in London.

32:55.024 --> 32:57.925
They wish to secure
the rights to my memoirs.

32:57.993 --> 32:59.984
<i>Oh, yeah, I meant to
tell you about that.</i>

33:00.062 --> 33:01.427
<i>Why, Jonathan,</i>

33:01.530 --> 33:04.363
I didn't know you'd even
submitted them to anyone.

33:04.433 --> 33:06.424
<i>I didn't, and certainly not
to Remington-Lordes.</i>

33:06.502 --> 33:08.265
That would have been
too much to hope for.

33:08.337 --> 33:10.771
They're a most
selective publisher.

33:11.407 --> 33:14.706
<i>Magnum once encouraged me
to take the plunge, but I...</i>

33:25.521 --> 33:26.715
Magnum.

33:27.222 --> 33:29.782
What a very generous thing
for him to do.

33:29.858 --> 33:31.018
<i>Well, why not?</i>

33:31.093 --> 33:32.993
<i>It's about time you got
published in your own name,</i>

33:33.062 --> 33:34.996
<i>because you are
Robin Masters, aren't you?</i>

33:35.064 --> 33:36.292
<i>Or rather, he's you.</i>

33:36.365 --> 33:37.798
Yes.
I knew it!

33:37.866 --> 33:40.232
<i>Wait a minute,
you talking to me or Agatha?</i>

33:40.302 --> 33:44.568
An interesting query. But are
the memoirs ready for publication?

33:44.840 --> 33:48.367
<i>Well, that's not what I wanted
to talk to you about anyway.</i>

33:48.444 --> 33:50.503
"The balmy breezes
brushed the war"

33:50.579 --> 33:53.275
<i>"gently from our minds,
from time to time,"</i>

33:53.348 --> 33:56.078
"yet we were never far
from the awful truth."

33:56.385 --> 33:58.819
I'm just not gonna
take this lying down.

34:02.391 --> 34:04.086
This is Edward Durant.

34:04.393 --> 34:06.691
<i>I'd like you to draw up
my final bill, please.</i>

34:07.830 --> 34:08.819
Thank you.

34:14.103 --> 34:15.764
I don't get it.

34:16.538 --> 34:18.402
I don't know what
she sees in you.

34:19.141 --> 34:21.871
<i>I mean, no offense,
but you're so serious.</i>

34:22.344 --> 34:24.812
You don't seem to have
any sense of humor at all.

34:28.684 --> 34:30.914
<i>Oh, you're not
gonna call her again, are you?</i>

34:31.420 --> 34:34.514
<i>She asked for a little time, don't
you think you could give her that?</i>

34:38.494 --> 34:41.292
<i>Well, at least you've
got a little common sense.</i>

34:43.665 --> 34:47.157
<i>Boy, it's a good thing you didn't call her.</i>

34:51.306 --> 34:54.002
<i>No, wait a minute...
Wait a minute.</i>

34:54.076 --> 34:56.442
Maybe you should give her
a piece of your mind.

34:56.512 --> 34:58.742
<i>And don't call her, go see her.</i>

34:59.481 --> 35:02.279
<i>Get real aggressive,
she likes that in a man.</i>

35:03.152 --> 35:07.418
Tell her she's being
stupid and stubborn.

35:08.724 --> 35:11.352
<i>Tell her you're giving her
an ultimatum,</i>

35:11.426 --> 35:14.827
<i>go back to France with you,
or else. Oh, she'll like that.</i>

35:14.897 --> 35:18.264
<i>Oh, sure, it's a little white
lie, but it's for her own good.</i>

35:21.537 --> 35:22.799
Congratulations.

35:25.307 --> 35:27.298
You got through.
What?

35:28.043 --> 35:29.635
I hope you're proud of yourself.

35:29.711 --> 35:31.201
What are you talking about?

35:32.114 --> 35:33.979
There's no way
Michelle will stay with him

35:34.049 --> 35:36.017
after he delivers
his little ultimatum.

35:36.985 --> 35:38.179
Well...

35:38.253 --> 35:39.720
Is that what you want?

35:39.988 --> 35:42.957
You want her to be alone and
pine away for you her whole life?

35:43.659 --> 35:44.921
Don't you want her to be happy?

35:45.260 --> 35:46.488
Of course I do.

35:47.462 --> 35:48.724
I didn't mean...

35:49.398 --> 35:51.696
I guess I never
looked at it that way.

35:54.303 --> 35:55.895
<i>Okay, maybe that was
a cheap shot.</i>

35:55.971 --> 35:57.939
Let me go try and stop it. Can't.

35:58.006 --> 35:59.667
You got through to
one person. Time's up.

35:59.741 --> 36:00.833
That was our deal.

36:00.909 --> 36:03.173
<i>Now, wait a minute. By one
person I didn't mean Durant.</i>

36:03.245 --> 36:04.678
You made the choice.

36:04.746 --> 36:06.441
I can't believe you'd do this.

36:06.515 --> 36:08.642
<i>Hey, we got rules, too,
you know.</i>

36:08.717 --> 36:11.242
How much time would a dozen Napoleons buy me?

36:16.625 --> 36:18.525
You pick this stuff up
pretty quick.

36:18.760 --> 36:20.227
How much time?

36:30.839 --> 36:32.363
Michelle!

36:39.548 --> 36:41.448
<i>I don't think we have to worry.</i>

36:42.251 --> 36:44.685
<i>As soon as she calms down,
she'll come back.</i>

36:45.220 --> 36:47.950
<i>Well, I don't know
what came over me.</i>

36:49.558 --> 36:51.458
I wasn't even
acting like myself.

36:51.727 --> 36:54.560
And you can tell her that. I'm
sure that she'll understand.

36:56.331 --> 36:58.629
Where's Michelle?
Colonel Greene!

36:58.700 --> 37:02.067
I don't know. We had an argument
and she left. I'm Edward Durant.

37:02.137 --> 37:03.968
<i>Yeah, we figured out
who you are.</i>

37:04.273 --> 37:05.968
You're unimportant
at the moment.

37:06.275 --> 37:08.266
<i>Yeah, I guess
you're probably right.</i>

37:08.343 --> 37:09.970
<i>Mr. Durant, I'm
Lieutenant Commander Poole.</i>

37:10.045 --> 37:12.809
<i>We've just found out that operatives
know Michelle's on the Island,</i>

37:12.881 --> 37:14.280
and they know
where she's staying.

37:14.349 --> 37:16.180
Can you think of any place
she might have gone?

37:17.853 --> 37:20.253
I think I know
where she might be.

37:48.790 --> 37:50.223
Have the doctors...

37:51.904 --> 37:54.464
His condition seems
to be getting worse.

37:55.041 --> 37:58.875
There's not much chance of
his coming out of the coma.

38:00.613 --> 38:05.209
<i>Michelle, your safety was
of utmost concern to him.</i>

38:06.552 --> 38:10.454
I know he would have
understood why you can't stay.

38:11.991 --> 38:13.982
You talk as if
he's already gone.

38:17.463 --> 38:20.398
The men who shot him believed
he was dead when they left him.

38:21.100 --> 38:23.159
The fact that he's
survived this long

38:23.636 --> 38:25.729
is more than anyone
could have hoped for.

38:27.139 --> 38:28.606
<i>But, uh,</i>

38:28.674 --> 38:31.837
his doctors believe that we
should now begin to accept

38:32.745 --> 38:34.542
the inevitability of...

38:37.216 --> 38:38.478
No.

38:40.052 --> 38:41.349
I can't.

38:42.888 --> 38:44.981
It can't happen like this.

39:10.516 --> 39:15.146
<i>I think that you should consider
that if you leave like this,</i>

39:16.455 --> 39:19.618
you'll never know the truth
of who Robin Masters is.

39:29.902 --> 39:31.335
If you would

39:33.372 --> 39:35.636
indulge me in one more story.

39:38.978 --> 39:42.141
I think perhaps
you would find this useful.

39:45.684 --> 39:47.379
<i>"After five days,</i>

39:47.920 --> 39:49.945
<i>"the medical unit
had given up hope,</i>

39:50.656 --> 39:53.557
"and a runner was sent
for Father Kirkpatrick.

39:54.059 --> 39:56.721
"The runner had only been
gone a scant 10 minutes

39:56.796 --> 39:59.959
"when the most
miraculous event occurred.

40:01.100 --> 40:02.590
<i>"Private Channing,"</i>

40:02.668 --> 40:04.761
<i>"whom everyone had
given up for dead,"</i>

40:05.504 --> 40:08.302
<i>"opened his eyes, looked around,"</i>

40:09.041 --> 40:11.441
"and asked for
a pint of stout."

40:53.018 --> 40:54.383
Michelle.

40:55.487 --> 40:58.786
You have to go back to the
estate. This isn't safe.

41:00.426 --> 41:02.257
You have to go back.

41:06.632 --> 41:08.497
<i>What happened with Durant,</i>

41:10.803 --> 41:12.430
that was my fault.

41:13.606 --> 41:15.096
I put him up to it.

41:15.674 --> 41:17.904
You have to go back
and talk to him.

41:18.777 --> 41:20.870
Buck Greene's there.
He'll help you.

41:23.616 --> 41:24.878
Don't panic!

41:28.454 --> 41:30.046
They've got
a faster car than you.

41:30.122 --> 41:32.556
You can't outrun them.
Listen to me!

41:32.958 --> 41:36.018
<i>Now, shift down and you'll
stay in control. No, no brakes!</i>

41:44.837 --> 41:46.236
<i>Michelle, listen to me!</i>

41:47.606 --> 41:50.097
You can't die. You have to
take care of our daughter.

41:51.610 --> 41:52.838
<i>Now, shift down.</i>

41:55.547 --> 41:56.536
That's it.

42:00.486 --> 42:02.818
Don't let them pass you.
Use the whole road.

42:11.864 --> 42:15.095
Pour on a little gas. You can
accelerate into the corners. No brakes.

42:19.505 --> 42:21.063
You're doing great.

42:34.787 --> 42:37.415
After this turn there's
a straightaway. Gear down.

42:45.331 --> 42:48.698
<i>Now, we're gonna surprise them. You'll
have to take this next turn fast.</i>

42:57.076 --> 42:58.304
Stay off the brakes.

42:58.777 --> 43:00.108
That's it.

43:01.180 --> 43:02.670
You're doing fine.

43:05.150 --> 43:06.344
<i>Okay, get ready.</i>

43:11.390 --> 43:12.914
Hit the brakes!
Hit them!

43:45.924 --> 43:47.448
That's my girl.

44:23.896 --> 44:25.363
I love this place.

44:29.802 --> 44:32.828
I don't know how
you knew to come here.

44:34.306 --> 44:36.206
But maybe I know why.

44:42.581 --> 44:44.515
I've always liked
to be up here alone.

44:46.852 --> 44:49.821
You can breathe better here.

44:52.191 --> 44:53.624
Slow down a little bit.

44:56.562 --> 44:58.257
Try to get things into focus.

44:59.498 --> 45:01.762
Kind of figure out
what it is you need to do.

45:14.580 --> 45:15.911
<i>I love you, Michelle.</i>

45:19.418 --> 45:21.147
More than anyone
I've ever known.

45:28.093 --> 45:29.560
And I'm letting you go.

46:32.024 --> 46:33.218
<i>Magnum...</i>

46:40.732 --> 46:43.326
<i>I demand you
come back immediately.</i>

46:43.969 --> 46:45.368
<i>Magnum!</i>
