<i>This week on "Vice,"</i>

00:08.956 --> 00:10.490
<i>the environmental time bomb</i>

00:10.525 --> 00:11.857
<i>of our thawing planet.</i>

00:13.000 --> 00:19.074
-= www.OpenSubtitles.org =-

00:20.368 --> 00:22.967
<i>Everywhere
there are bits splintering,</i>

00:23.003 --> 00:24.902
<i>breaking and falling down.</i>

00:24.938 --> 00:26.971
<i>And then, the new
underground railroad</i>

00:27.007 --> 00:29.040
<i>for refugees across Europe.</i>

00:31.411 --> 00:33.178
<i>We are right
in the middle of Paris.</i>

00:33.213 --> 00:37.516
There are hundreds, maybe,
thousands of tents set up here.

00:49.094 --> 00:50.461
Go, go, go!

00:52.865 --> 00:54.365
We are not animals!

01:05.977 --> 01:08.744
Fully, 24% of the
northern hemisphere

01:08.780 --> 01:10.547
is covered by permafrost,

01:10.582 --> 01:12.381
<i>deep layers of soil and water</i>

01:12.416 --> 01:15.450
<i>that have been frozen
for thousands of years.</i>

01:15.486 --> 01:18.920
But National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration scientists

01:18.955 --> 01:22.391
<i>have now found that the Arctic
is warming twice as fast</i>

01:22.426 --> 01:23.992
<i>as the rest of the planet,</i>

01:24.027 --> 01:25.994
<i>which is causing
the permafrost to thaw</i>

01:26.029 --> 01:28.297
<i>and release trapped
greenhouse gasses.</i>

01:28.332 --> 01:31.399
And this release of
methane and carbon is, in turn,

01:31.434 --> 01:32.466
accelerating climate change.

01:32.502 --> 01:35.736
<i>Now, due to the seriousness
of the situation,</i>

01:35.771 --> 01:38.038
<i>a global effort is
challenging scientists</i>

01:38.074 --> 01:39.640
<i>to come up with a solution.</i>

01:39.676 --> 01:41.709
And one of the options
they're pursuing

01:41.744 --> 01:44.312
is nothing short of astounding.

01:54.523 --> 01:57.557
So, we're walking out onto a...
frozen lake.

01:57.593 --> 02:01.561
So, we are gonna
go out here and look for some pockets

02:01.597 --> 02:05.030
of methane gas
trapped in the lake ice.

02:05.065 --> 02:06.865
<i>Katey Walter
Anthony is a researcher</i>

02:06.900 --> 02:09.300
<i>with the University of Alaska
in Fairbanks.</i>

02:09.336 --> 02:10.769
<i>She wanted to show
us a phenomenon</i>

02:10.804 --> 02:13.872
<i>that could have dramatic repercussions
for our changing climate.</i>

02:13.907 --> 02:18.043
The methane is here because
the permafrost is thawing.

02:18.078 --> 02:19.378
And when it thaws...

02:19.413 --> 02:22.480
there are microbes in
the bottom of the lake that eat

02:22.515 --> 02:25.450
the carbon that was in the permafrost
and they make methane gas.

02:25.485 --> 02:27.719
One molecule of methane is 20--

02:27.754 --> 02:30.020
is like 25 molecules
of carbon dioxide,

02:30.056 --> 02:32.624
so it-- it's a really strong
greenhouse gas.

02:32.659 --> 02:35.893
And methane is contributing
to climate warming,

02:35.928 --> 02:39.563
and making the warming
that's already happening worse.

02:40.666 --> 02:42.466
- So, get down low.
- Okay.

02:42.501 --> 02:43.867
And as soon as I put this in,

02:43.902 --> 02:46.570
as soon as I break through, gas will
rush out, and you want to basically

02:46.605 --> 02:49.673
get it right down in the gas stream, ready?
Right above the hole, okay.

02:51.610 --> 02:52.576
Oy!

02:52.611 --> 02:54.310
Holy crap.

02:54.345 --> 02:56.679
- That burned me.
- It works.

02:56.714 --> 02:58.213
- You okay?
- Yep.

02:59.417 --> 03:00.916
Wow.

03:00.951 --> 03:02.518
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

03:02.553 --> 03:04.153
I didn't expect it
to be that powerful.

03:06.023 --> 03:07.323
Woo.

03:07.358 --> 03:09.992
And this is a-- a fairly
recent discovery?

03:10.027 --> 03:11.160
Yeah.

03:11.195 --> 03:13.194
There's two times as much
carbon in the frozen ground

03:13.229 --> 03:14.562
as there is in the atmosphere.

03:16.933 --> 03:18.566
Whoa.

03:19.536 --> 03:20.935
Wow.

03:20.970 --> 03:23.471
A large part of that carbon
can be released and...

03:23.507 --> 03:25.840
and add more carbon dioxide
and methane to the atmosphere,

03:25.875 --> 03:28.742
making climate warming
even worse than we expect.

03:29.679 --> 03:30.944
If you break through,

03:30.979 --> 03:32.513
don't pull your
spear out right away.

03:32.548 --> 03:35.248
- Leave it in there 'til I get my torch over.
- Okay.

03:38.020 --> 03:40.521
That was pretty good.

03:40.556 --> 03:42.589
So there are millions
of lakes, like this now,

03:42.625 --> 03:44.958
- and there are probably going to be
millions more. - That's right.

03:44.993 --> 03:47.226
In the not too distant
future, so all you can do is--

03:47.261 --> 03:48.461
is keep it underground.

03:48.496 --> 03:51.297
There's nothing else
you can do to mitigate this.

03:51.333 --> 03:53.499
If we can slow down
climate warming,

03:53.535 --> 03:55.668
it will slow down
permafrost thaw,

03:55.704 --> 03:58.204
which will cause less
of a temperature increase.

03:58.239 --> 04:00.206
If we speed up climate warming,

04:00.241 --> 04:02.607
and permafrost flash thaws,

04:02.643 --> 04:04.909
<i>then we'll have a huge
pulse of greenhouse gasses,</i>

04:04.945 --> 04:06.511
<i>especially methane
going into the atmosphere,</i>

04:06.547 --> 04:08.547
<i>that will cause a really
abrupt warming.</i>

04:08.582 --> 04:10.482
<i>There's more carbon
locked in the permafrost,</i>

04:10.517 --> 04:12.351
<i>than humans have released
into the atmosphere</i>

04:12.386 --> 04:13.418
<i>since the beginning</i>

04:13.454 --> 04:14.386
<i>of the industrial age,</i>

04:14.421 --> 04:17.221
<i>and it has already
started to thaw.</i>

04:17.257 --> 04:20.156
<i>To understand just how
profound the impact could be,</i>

04:20.192 --> 04:22.593
<i>we went to NASA's
Jet Propulsion Lab,</i>

04:22.628 --> 04:25.696
<i>where Dr. Charles Miller showed
us some dire projections.</i>

04:25.732 --> 04:28.699
Just from thaw-induced
carbon release,

04:28.735 --> 04:32.069
the amount of temperature
change could be as high

04:32.104 --> 04:33.738
as a full degree or more.

04:33.773 --> 04:36.973
Now, when you couple that
in to the fully, um,

04:37.008 --> 04:38.040
coupled climate models,

04:38.076 --> 04:39.942
it's projecting out,
somewhere in the neighborhood

04:39.978 --> 04:42.645
of four to five degrees C
temperature change.

04:42.681 --> 04:44.647
Other models that I've seen

04:44.683 --> 04:48.017
definitely show
eight to ten degree changes

04:48.052 --> 04:50.887
in the Arctic
by the 2100 time frame.

04:50.922 --> 04:51.921
What would the planet look like

04:51.956 --> 04:54.155
with temperature rises
of eight or nine degrees?

04:54.191 --> 04:57.893
Eight degrees, ten degrees
type of temperature change

04:57.928 --> 05:02.197
may well take us into
a tropical type of Earth,

05:02.232 --> 05:04.733
even in the mid
to upper latitudes--

05:04.769 --> 05:06.668
just something
dramatically different

05:06.704 --> 05:08.771
that none of us
have ever experienced.

05:08.806 --> 05:10.905
So, really, the entire world
ought to be focused

05:10.940 --> 05:13.841
on keeping this carbon
within the ground there.

05:13.877 --> 05:16.844
That would be, uh, something
that would be admirable,

05:16.880 --> 05:19.414
but I think we're
already on a path

05:19.449 --> 05:22.817
to releasing a significant
fraction of this carbon.

05:22.852 --> 05:24.919
<i>Because of
its size and location,</i>

05:24.954 --> 05:29.022
<i>one country where permafrost thaw
is a major problem is Russia,</i>

05:29.057 --> 05:30.323
<i>and because nearly 70%</i>

05:30.358 --> 05:32.592
<i>of the country's landmass
is permafrost,</i>

05:32.628 --> 05:34.828
<i>Russian scientists are
also at the forefront</i>

05:34.863 --> 05:36.996
<i>of the search for solutions.</i>

05:38.133 --> 05:39.533
<i>We went to Siberia,</i>

05:39.568 --> 05:42.368
<i>where the effects of the thawing
permafrost are plain to see.</i>

05:52.880 --> 05:54.613
The road is
not used anymore now?

06:14.801 --> 06:17.068
This lake is new?
In your lifetime?

06:19.071 --> 06:20.504
<i>Sergey Zimov has been studying</i>

06:20.539 --> 06:22.973
<i>the Arctic landscape
for over 30 years.</i>

06:23.008 --> 06:25.476
<i>He's seen firsthand
how permafrost is thawing</i>

06:25.511 --> 06:26.944
<i>under a changing climate.</i>

06:35.887 --> 06:38.153
<i>Zimov and his team
have dug a series of tunnels</i>

06:38.189 --> 06:39.489
<i>to study permafrost,</i>

06:39.524 --> 06:43.158
<i>the vast frozen layer of soil,
ice and organic matter</i>

06:43.194 --> 06:45.828
<i>that covers 24%
of the northern hemisphere</i>

06:45.864 --> 06:48.931
<i>and can extend
to depths of 5,000 feet.</i>

06:50.167 --> 06:51.400
Take a look at this.

06:52.903 --> 06:55.403
This is pretty much just...

06:55.438 --> 06:56.638
pure ice almost,

06:56.673 --> 06:59.207
but it's-- it's permafrost,

06:59.242 --> 07:00.942
and I'm not even
that deep underground.

07:00.978 --> 07:02.544
We're-- I don't know--

07:02.579 --> 07:04.078
ten feet underground?

07:04.114 --> 07:07.448
But from above, you'd never
guess it was this cold.

07:20.496 --> 07:21.762
Yeah.

07:34.576 --> 07:37.010
This was all permafrost
under this? Everything?

07:52.026 --> 07:54.426
Yeah.

07:54.461 --> 07:56.695
Yeah.

07:56.730 --> 07:58.229
<i>And to illustrate this,</i>

07:58.265 --> 08:00.432
<i>researchers took us to one
of the most stunning examples</i>

08:00.467 --> 08:02.967
<i>of permafrost thaw in the world.</i>

08:06.706 --> 08:09.874
They're taking us
to see what they call a slump,

08:09.909 --> 08:12.810
which is when
the permafrost and the ice

08:12.845 --> 08:16.681
have thawed or melted so much
that the ground has collapsed.

08:16.716 --> 08:20.516
<i>Locals call it "The Gateway
to the Underworld."</i>

08:20.552 --> 08:24.187
<i>At over half a mile wide,
and 300 feet deep,</i>

08:24.222 --> 08:26.756
<i>this crater is the largest
of its kind</i>

08:26.792 --> 08:29.693
<i>caused by permafrost thaw.</i>

08:36.467 --> 08:38.634
Oh, yeah.

08:38.669 --> 08:40.736
This is solid ice.

08:40.770 --> 08:45.207
Just like...
you can see on that huge wall.

08:45.242 --> 08:48.243
So when you walk
down into the slump,

08:48.278 --> 08:50.946
you end up facing
an almost kilometer wide

08:50.982 --> 08:53.514
wall of permafrost.

08:53.549 --> 08:55.516
And it almost sounds
like it's alive, 'cause

08:55.551 --> 08:58.019
everywhere
there are bits splintering,

08:58.054 --> 08:59.587
breaking, and falling down.

08:59.623 --> 09:01.756
And even that-- that stream,
that running water,

09:01.791 --> 09:04.391
that-- that's water,
just water, coming from--

09:04.427 --> 09:07.128
from the melting ice
and the thawing permafrost.

09:09.397 --> 09:11.865
<i>As the exposed permafrost
continues to thaw,</i>

09:11.900 --> 09:14.001
<i>the crater keeps getting bigger,</i>

09:14.036 --> 09:16.870
<i>expanding 60 feet every year.</i>

09:17.706 --> 09:19.039
Do you think this
is a warning sign?

09:19.074 --> 09:21.041
Do you think you could see
many more of these

09:21.076 --> 09:22.743
in the not too distant future?

09:31.919 --> 09:33.352
Like, it's easy to imagine
seeing this--

09:33.387 --> 09:34.954
what would happen if-- if...

09:34.989 --> 09:37.123
you know, a piece of land
that had a town on top of it

09:37.158 --> 09:39.125
were to go like this?

09:45.766 --> 09:48.700
Yeah, look! There's
a huge crack behind us.

09:48.735 --> 09:49.701
This-- this makes me nervous.

09:49.736 --> 09:51.302
This is-- this feels
very precarious.

09:51.337 --> 09:53.638
Feels like it's about to go.

09:54.607 --> 09:56.541
<i>As more and more
permafrost thaws,</i>

09:56.576 --> 09:57.942
<i>and the ground falls away,</i>

09:57.978 --> 10:01.979
<i>carbon that was frozen in the permafrost
is released into the atmosphere.</i>

10:02.014 --> 10:02.980
<i>On a mass scale,</i>

10:03.015 --> 10:05.883
<i>this process can
accelerate climate change.</i>

10:05.918 --> 10:08.118
<i>A solution is urgently needed.</i>

10:10.156 --> 10:11.521
If we don't do this,

10:11.557 --> 10:12.890
what is the price we will pay

10:12.925 --> 10:14.457
when all of these
gasses are released?

10:20.165 --> 10:23.432
<i>But Sergey Zimov has a
plan to keep the ground frozen.</i>

10:23.467 --> 10:25.334
<i>He took us along
the Kolyma River</i>

10:25.369 --> 10:26.969
<i>to a site that might just prove</i>

10:27.005 --> 10:29.271
<i>we can break the cycle.</i>

10:29.307 --> 10:31.307
<i>Zimov is gathering animals here,</i>

10:31.342 --> 10:33.442
<i>animals that will transform
the landscape</i>

10:33.477 --> 10:36.011
<i>from forest back into grassland,</i>

10:36.046 --> 10:39.480
<i>which he says is much better
at preserving the permafrost.</i>

10:54.330 --> 10:56.030
What does that do
to the permafrost?

11:08.910 --> 11:11.778
And just having animals
grazing here is enough

11:11.813 --> 11:13.412
for that difference
in temperature?

11:29.496 --> 11:31.396
<i>The animals
trample the vegetation,</i>

11:31.431 --> 11:33.799
<i>which leaves the ground
more exposed to the cold,</i>

11:33.834 --> 11:36.501
<i>keeping the permafrost frozen.</i>

11:36.536 --> 11:39.638
<i>Plus, while forest is dark,
grass is light,</i>

11:39.673 --> 11:40.839
<i>and the lighter the surface,</i>

11:40.875 --> 11:43.841
<i>the more heat from the sun
is reflected back to space.</i>

11:55.955 --> 11:57.255
Just take it back to what it was

11:57.290 --> 11:59.455
thousands of years ago?

11:59.491 --> 12:01.424
<i>To prove his
theory, Zimov and his team</i>

12:01.459 --> 12:03.726
<i>are rounding up animals
from across Siberia</i>

12:03.762 --> 12:04.961
<i>to populate his park.</i>

12:15.140 --> 12:16.438
<i>While the reindeer help,</i>

12:16.473 --> 12:18.174
<i>in order to fully
restore this land</i>

12:18.209 --> 12:19.708
<i>to its prehistoric state,</i>

12:19.743 --> 12:22.577
<i>it will take some
prehistoric wildlife.</i>

12:22.613 --> 12:23.879
You've shown us
some of the animals

12:23.915 --> 12:25.214
that you've brought back.

12:25.249 --> 12:27.549
Um, there's also been talk
about bringing back

12:27.584 --> 12:29.084
the woolly mammoth.

12:41.564 --> 12:42.496
So, really, you need
the mammoth,

12:42.532 --> 12:45.233
or something like it,
for it to be complete.

12:47.137 --> 12:48.903
<i>This might sound farfetched,</i>

12:48.939 --> 12:51.404
<i>but scientists at the
Institute of Applied Ecology</i>

12:51.440 --> 12:53.974
<i>are working on this very idea.</i>

12:54.009 --> 12:56.310
<i>Ironically, the solution
to this problem</i>

12:56.345 --> 12:59.346
<i>might also have been
frozen in permafrost.</i>

13:20.034 --> 13:21.674
And do you know how old this is?

13:24.004 --> 13:25.770
And at 28,000 years old,

13:25.805 --> 13:28.206
you'd still be able
to get DNA samples from this?

13:41.387 --> 13:42.552
<i>This sample could provide</i>

13:42.588 --> 13:46.690
<i>the genetic material needed
to bring the Mammoth back.</i>

13:46.725 --> 13:50.194
So, they're now, um, taking
samples from all over the trunk

13:50.229 --> 13:54.464
to try and find the most
perfectly preserved DNA,

13:54.500 --> 13:57.167
which could then
potentially be used for a clone.

13:58.270 --> 13:59.135
Well, do you think, for example

13:59.170 --> 14:01.837
in your lifetime,
or in the next ten years,

14:01.873 --> 14:05.074
we could actually see living,
breathing Woolly Mammoths?

14:22.793 --> 14:23.825
<i>It is possible to look at--</i>

14:23.860 --> 14:26.295
<i>look at Sergey as a kind
of Don Quixote figure,</i>

14:26.330 --> 14:28.230
but you think he's--
he's onto something

14:28.265 --> 14:30.065
and it could actually--
it could actually work?

14:30.100 --> 14:34.802
Sergey has proposed
to reintroduce natural,

14:34.837 --> 14:39.073
perhaps even
Ice Age flora and fauna,

14:39.108 --> 14:40.207
plants and animals,

14:40.243 --> 14:43.577
allowing nature
to, basically, heal itself.

14:43.612 --> 14:45.712
That winds up generally being

14:45.748 --> 14:48.715
the fastest
and most efficient way

14:48.751 --> 14:51.418
to restore
the previous landscape,

14:51.453 --> 14:55.055
ecosystems, bio-diversity,
and climate.

15:17.311 --> 15:19.044
<i>If the ancient Arctic ecosystem</i>

15:19.080 --> 15:21.513
<i>can be restored
using geoengineering,</i>

15:21.548 --> 15:24.015
<i>Sergey will have demonstrated
a viable solution</i>

15:24.050 --> 15:27.085
<i>to halt the threat
of permafrost thaw.</i>

15:28.554 --> 15:29.653
When we first reported

15:29.689 --> 15:31.222
on the refugee crisis in Europe,

15:31.257 --> 15:36.294
<i>countries across the EU were struggling to
take in hundreds of thousands of people</i>

15:36.329 --> 15:38.629
<i>fleeing war
and crossing the Mediterranean.</i>

15:40.866 --> 15:44.034
<i>Now, after a series
of deadly terror attacks</i>

15:44.069 --> 15:46.336
<i>spurred a wave of nationalism,</i>

15:46.372 --> 15:47.337
<i>countries across Europe</i>

15:47.373 --> 15:50.940
<i>have tightened their
border controls even further.</i>

15:50.976 --> 15:53.043
We sent Gianna Toboni to Italy

15:53.078 --> 15:55.145
to report on a growing
underground network

15:55.180 --> 15:58.814
that has emerged to help these
refugees on their migratory path.

16:07.658 --> 16:09.958
We are in Ventimiglia, Italy,

16:09.994 --> 16:13.529
and this group of young,
Ethiopian refugees

16:13.564 --> 16:15.730
<i>is just about to leave
on their trek</i>

16:15.765 --> 16:17.432
<i>to cross the border into France.</i>

16:18.535 --> 16:19.867
<i>Many refugees who arrive</i>

16:19.903 --> 16:21.069
<i>in Italy from Libya,</i>

16:21.104 --> 16:22.270
<i>travel across the country</i>

16:22.305 --> 16:23.505
<i>to get to
the border-towns,</i>

16:23.540 --> 16:24.872
<i>where they attempt to make</i>

16:24.908 --> 16:26.541
<i>the illegal trek into France.</i>

16:26.576 --> 16:28.643
We're following these railways,

16:28.678 --> 16:31.178
which are gonna lead us
all the way up the mountain.

16:31.213 --> 16:34.314
We'll probably be hiking for the
next five, six, seven hours,

16:34.350 --> 16:35.516
<i>'til we get
to the French border,</i>

16:35.551 --> 16:37.918
and that's when
we'll cross over.

16:37.953 --> 16:40.587
How many times have you tried
to cross into France?

16:42.491 --> 16:43.890
Think you'll
make it this time?

16:55.070 --> 16:57.002
Yeah.

16:58.339 --> 17:00.406
<i>Just before we left
with Shaashoo and Nas,</i>

17:00.442 --> 17:01.974
<i>they explained that
the violence against</i>

17:02.009 --> 17:04.109
<i>their persecuted
ethnic group in Ethiopia</i>

17:04.145 --> 17:05.877
<i>drove them to leave the country.</i>

17:05.912 --> 17:07.551
Do you think that if you
would have stayed

17:07.580 --> 17:10.013
in Ethiopia, you would
have been killed?

17:17.924 --> 17:20.157
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

17:20.194 --> 17:21.526
I'm sorry.

17:22.795 --> 17:25.162
<i>Italy has been
overwhelmed by a surge of more</i>

17:25.198 --> 17:28.499
<i>than 180,000 refugees
just in the past year.</i>

17:28.534 --> 17:30.968
<i>A new EU regulation
made in February</i>

17:31.003 --> 17:33.204
<i>is attempting to stem
this constant flow of people</i>

17:33.239 --> 17:35.239
<i>migrating to Europe
through Libya.</i>

17:35.274 --> 17:37.541
<i>But for those refugees
who have already made it,</i>

17:37.577 --> 17:39.242
<i>the EU is forcing
them to register</i>

17:39.277 --> 17:42.178
<i>and remain indefinitely in
the first country they enter,</i>

17:42.214 --> 17:43.246
<i>leaving many
living on the streets,</i>

17:43.281 --> 17:46.216
<i>while waiting for their
asylum claims to be processed.</i>

17:54.092 --> 17:54.957
Comes up.

17:54.993 --> 17:56.825
They know where
to send you afterwards.

17:56.860 --> 17:58.527
Yeah.

18:05.236 --> 18:07.169
So everybody just
got off the train tracks,

18:07.204 --> 18:09.070
and we're now
walking on the highway.

18:12.443 --> 18:13.941
Oh, careful, careful.

18:15.378 --> 18:16.477
Guys, this is terrifying.

18:16.513 --> 18:18.045
These cars come so close to us,

18:18.080 --> 18:19.880
and there's nowhere else to go.

18:24.820 --> 18:26.220
<i>Once off the railroad tracks,</i>

18:26.256 --> 18:28.022
<i>each passing car
on this narrow road,</i>

18:28.057 --> 18:30.757
<i>could potentially
report them to the authorities.</i>

18:41.970 --> 18:43.570
This is fucked up.

18:43.605 --> 18:45.605
What do you do if a car comes?

18:45.641 --> 18:47.073
There's nowhere to go.

18:48.276 --> 18:49.708
Does this scare you guys?

19:03.891 --> 19:04.922
<i>Around 3:00 a.m.,</i>

19:04.957 --> 19:06.357
<i>we cross the border into France</i>

19:06.393 --> 19:07.725
<i>with Shaashoo and his friends.</i>

19:07.760 --> 19:10.662
<i>At sunrise,
French police arrested them,</i>

19:10.697 --> 19:11.996
<i>and sent them all the way back</i>

19:12.031 --> 19:14.131
<i>to where they
first arrived in Italy.</i>

19:15.468 --> 19:17.001
<i>The French police
reported nearly</i>

19:17.036 --> 19:19.103
<i>40,000 migrant arrests
in the area</i>

19:19.138 --> 19:21.605
<i>just in 2016.</i>

19:21.640 --> 19:23.173
<i>For those who
make it into France,</i>

19:23.209 --> 19:24.641
<i>there's a new route
emerging in the Alps,</i>

19:24.677 --> 19:28.212
<i>where a group of local French
citizens are offering them refuge.</i>

19:28.247 --> 19:30.980
We are way up in the mountains
on the French/Italian border.

19:31.016 --> 19:34.918
This is kind of like the underground
railroad for these refugees.

19:34.953 --> 19:37.487
And it runs right through a farm

19:37.523 --> 19:39.988
that's owned by a man
named Cédric

19:40.024 --> 19:42.291
who's actually taken
a lot of these migrants in

19:42.327 --> 19:44.093
and is allowing them
to live in his backyard.

19:46.698 --> 19:49.798
Hi. Hello. <i>Allô. Ca Va?</i>

19:49.834 --> 19:51.800
How are you?
What is your name?

19:51.836 --> 19:53.035
Hi.

19:54.905 --> 19:56.204
Hello.
Hello.

19:56.240 --> 19:58.473
Wow. Lot of people.
Hello.

19:58.508 --> 20:00.575
- Nice to meet you.
- Hi.

20:00.611 --> 20:02.110
Gianna. Nice to meet you.

20:03.513 --> 20:05.012
Hello.

20:05.048 --> 20:07.148
Nice to meet you. Wow.

20:34.309 --> 20:36.442
This is crazy.
You hear a plane overhead,

20:36.478 --> 20:39.011
and all of the refugees
just ran into their tent.

20:39.046 --> 20:40.980
<i>They're obviously terrified.</i>

20:52.926 --> 20:54.092
<i>Cédric was arrested</i>

20:54.127 --> 20:55.960
<i>and recently convicted
in French court</i>

20:55.996 --> 20:58.163
<i>of helping refugees
cross the border.</i>

20:58.198 --> 21:00.565
<i>Others like him
run the same risk.</i>

21:01.802 --> 21:03.334
<i>Not far from Cédric's farm,</i>

21:03.369 --> 21:05.068
<i>we met with
his friend Françoise,</i>

21:05.104 --> 21:08.872
<i>who has hosted more than two dozen
refugees at one time on her property.</i>

21:08.908 --> 21:11.241
So, how many people
do you have living with you?

21:11.277 --> 21:13.778
Oh, I think today... 18.

21:13.813 --> 21:15.680
- Wow.
- 19, I think.

21:15.715 --> 21:16.880
Yesterday, 25.

21:18.818 --> 21:22.018
<i>It's a situation
absolutely terrible,</i>

21:22.053 --> 21:25.288
<i>and now we are at the end
of our possibilities.</i>

21:25.324 --> 21:28.191
You see, I am very angry.
Very, very, very angry. - Yes.

21:28.226 --> 21:32.195
Because it's normal
that we, people,

21:32.230 --> 21:34.664
we must do the work
of our government.

21:34.700 --> 21:37.533
You think the government
should be doing more.

21:37.568 --> 21:39.768
The-- the government
do nothing.

21:39.804 --> 21:41.102
The problem is not they do more,

21:41.138 --> 21:42.438
they do nothing.

21:43.507 --> 21:44.640
<i>In meeting the refugees,</i>

21:44.675 --> 21:47.376
<i>we found that the majority
of them were 18 and under.</i>

21:48.979 --> 21:50.612
How old?

21:50.648 --> 21:52.981
Seventeen. And you?

21:54.151 --> 21:55.817
You?

21:55.852 --> 21:57.352
<i>Voila.</i> Children.

22:00.357 --> 22:04.058
Gianna, nice to meet you.
Hello! What's your name?

22:04.093 --> 22:05.960
Muhammad, nice to meet you.

22:11.433 --> 22:13.400
Oh, wow!

22:13.435 --> 22:15.168
Can you tell me
about your picture?

22:20.743 --> 22:24.310
What was it like traveling
from Sudan with kids this age?

22:29.550 --> 22:31.016
You just couldn't stay in Sudan.

22:44.399 --> 22:46.163
<i>As a lawyer,
Françoise understands</i>

22:46.199 --> 22:48.065
<i>the legal battles refugees face,</i>

22:48.101 --> 22:49.133
<i>and believes that
the French government</i>

22:49.168 --> 22:52.404
<i>turning away minors
violates humanitarian law.</i>

23:06.285 --> 23:08.184
<i>The ultimate goal
for many of the refugees</i>

23:08.220 --> 23:11.422
<i>is to move all the way north
through France to the UK.</i>

23:11.457 --> 23:12.856
<i>But when they reach
the English Channel,</i>

23:12.892 --> 23:16.059
<i>they find the UK border
is completely sealed,</i>

23:16.094 --> 23:18.128
<i>leading to massive
refugee settlements</i>

23:18.163 --> 23:19.296
<i>like the Calais Jungle.</i>

23:23.334 --> 23:25.568
We're overlooking
what's called "The Jungle."

23:25.603 --> 23:27.937
It's the biggest
refugee camp in France.

23:27.972 --> 23:31.106
There are over 8,000
refugees that are settled here.

23:31.142 --> 23:33.309
The problem now, though,
is that law enforcement

23:33.344 --> 23:36.878
is trying to evacuate
this entire camp.

23:36.914 --> 23:39.614
What's unclear is how exactly
they're going to do it,

23:39.650 --> 23:42.317
and how much of a fight these
refugees are going to put up.

24:03.639 --> 24:04.572
<i>Multiple fires burned</i>

24:04.607 --> 24:07.341
<i>across the camp
over the next few days.</i>

24:07.376 --> 24:08.642
<i>While people fled their tents,</i>

24:08.678 --> 24:10.977
<i>it was clear the authorities
were not in a rush</i>

24:11.012 --> 24:12.411
<i>to put them out.</i>

24:13.515 --> 24:15.482
<i>Volunteers like
Christian Salomé,</i>

24:15.517 --> 24:16.850
<i>the director of an NGO</i>

24:16.885 --> 24:18.585
<i>providing resources
to the refugees,</i>

24:18.620 --> 24:21.153
<i>began to feel desperate
for the remaining migrants</i>

24:21.189 --> 24:23.723
<i>whose homes
were quickly burning.</i>

25:04.095 --> 25:05.161
<i>Over the next few days,</i>

25:05.196 --> 25:07.463
<i>the government continued
to dismantle the Jungle,</i>

25:07.499 --> 25:10.800
<i>even though thousands
of refugees remained.</i>

25:17.275 --> 25:19.642
This is one of
the ways where kids,

25:19.677 --> 25:22.144
when put in a place
for weeks at a time,

25:22.179 --> 25:25.180
they'll make the place theirs.

25:27.919 --> 25:29.184
It's a good distraction.

25:31.488 --> 25:34.590
Uh-oh,
we're gettin' pushed out.

25:48.504 --> 25:50.805
<i>What is it like to see
this happening right now?</i>

26:02.918 --> 26:05.218
<i>In the coming days,
many of the minors were bussed</i>

26:05.253 --> 26:07.353
<i>to reception centers
across France</i>

26:07.389 --> 26:09.422
<i>while others
made their way to Paris.</i>

26:12.860 --> 26:14.760
We are right in
the middle of Paris.

26:14.796 --> 26:18.197
There are thousands
of tents set up here.

26:18.232 --> 26:20.265
It's clear that
this city is not set up

26:20.301 --> 26:22.735
for the amount of refugees
that have flooded into it.

26:22.770 --> 26:25.304
There aren't Social
Services out here.

26:25.339 --> 26:27.438
There are only
so many processing facilities,

26:27.474 --> 26:30.241
so it's basically just
a massive homeless camp

26:30.276 --> 26:32.577
for refugees
from all different countries.

26:33.614 --> 26:35.914
<i>In November 2016,
aid groups estimated</i>

26:35.949 --> 26:40.685
<i>that thousands of migrants were
living in tent cities across Paris.</i>

26:40.721 --> 26:42.420
<i>We met 23 year old Manuel,</i>

26:42.455 --> 26:45.122
<i>who fled Nigeria
nearly two years ago.</i>

26:45.157 --> 26:48.258
Lots of politicians in the US
and in European countries,

26:48.293 --> 26:50.160
there's this sort of
stigma around refugees.

26:50.195 --> 26:51.629
Can you just talk a
little bit about that?

26:51.664 --> 26:53.396
Like how are you seen
as a refugee?

26:53.432 --> 26:56.800
Each and every one of us,
my brothers here right now,

26:56.836 --> 26:59.136
never-- never wished
to be a refugee.

26:59.171 --> 27:02.138
It was the situation of the
country back where we lived,

27:02.173 --> 27:03.840
that turned us
to what we are now.

27:03.875 --> 27:06.308
Because I wouldn't imagine
myself to come to France

27:06.344 --> 27:07.710
and start sleeping
in the streets,

27:07.746 --> 27:10.713
when I have a good home and
everything is comfortable back there.

27:10.749 --> 27:12.414
<i>Even here, the refugees,</i>

27:12.450 --> 27:13.816
<i>many of them just teenagers,</i>

27:13.852 --> 27:15.918
<i>were met with the same
responses from authorities</i>

27:15.954 --> 27:18.120
<i>who began dismantling their
makeshift camp</i>

27:18.155 --> 27:19.788
<i>and destroying their tents.</i>

27:27.931 --> 27:30.098
Go back, go
back, go this way.

27:59.127 --> 28:02.062
It's tough to watch these
young people who traveled so far,

28:02.097 --> 28:03.596
and each new place they land,

28:03.631 --> 28:05.498
they get uprooted
and thrown out.

28:06.735 --> 28:08.901
Why did you decide
to leave Afghanistan?

28:29.856 --> 28:30.922
Oh, shit.

28:37.797 --> 28:39.330
We are not animals!

28:43.802 --> 28:45.869
We are not fighting!
Why you hit us?

28:45.904 --> 28:47.104
They want to kill us!
