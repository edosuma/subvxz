WEBVTT

00:05.216 --> 00:09.510
( Stan howling )

00:09.510 --> 00:11.262
What's up with
all the howling, Stan?

00:11.262 --> 00:13.394
I didn't hear any sirens
and the moon isn't full.

00:13.394 --> 00:15.266
And you finished filming
your reality show

00:15.266 --> 00:17.848
So You Think You Can Howl.

00:17.848 --> 00:20.981
No, I'm serenading my girlfriend
Princess through the fence.

00:20.981 --> 00:23.144
This is the only way
we can communicate

00:23.144 --> 00:26.237
since her mean owner Heather
insists on keeping us apart.

00:26.237 --> 00:28.069
You know, the real fun part
of my show was

00:28.069 --> 00:31.532
watching all the dogs who think
they can howl...but can't.

00:31.532 --> 00:33.244
( laughing )

00:33.244 --> 00:36.287
So I haven't heard
Princess howl back.

00:36.287 --> 00:39.370
I know. She hasn't returned
any of my howls in days.

00:39.370 --> 00:41.422
So she's either gotten
bored with me,

00:41.422 --> 00:43.504
or she's off on some
secret spy mission

00:43.504 --> 00:46.297
to save the planet
from the evil Dr. Cat.

00:46.297 --> 00:48.379
Probably not even
a real doctor.

00:48.379 --> 00:50.301
Probably got his doctorate
in feline studies.

00:50.301 --> 00:52.843
That's not even a real major!

00:52.843 --> 00:56.767
With Nikki in El Salvador,
I know how you feel being apart.

00:56.767 --> 00:59.350
Even texting is hard because
they charge by the letter.

00:59.350 --> 01:01.942
"I L U."

01:01.942 --> 01:05.446
Mommy said they don't
charge by the letter,
they charge by the text.

01:05.446 --> 01:07.188
Oh, let me resend that.

01:07.188 --> 01:09.820
"I lost underwear."

01:11.782 --> 01:14.365
Long distance relationships
are tough.

01:14.365 --> 01:16.617
Mason got moved to
the other side of the classroom.

01:16.617 --> 01:18.369
Now to see each other,

01:18.369 --> 01:20.201
we pretend we have to go to
the bathroom at the same time.

01:20.201 --> 01:23.964
Well, I pretend.
He can go anytime he wants.

01:23.964 --> 01:27.047
What a guy.

01:27.047 --> 01:29.210
Look, I'm just
worried about Princess.

01:29.210 --> 01:30.801
I hope nothing bad
happened to her.

01:30.801 --> 01:33.053
Well, dogs always bark
when the mailman comes.

01:33.053 --> 01:35.015
Why don't I just go over,
pretend to be the mailman,

01:35.015 --> 01:36.177
and see if she barks at me?

01:36.177 --> 01:38.058
Ha! That's ridiculous.

01:38.058 --> 01:40.311
No one would ever believe
you as a mailman.

01:40.311 --> 01:43.934
I'm a mailman.

01:46.147 --> 01:48.319
When I rang the doorbell,
Princess barked,

01:48.319 --> 01:50.691
which means she isn't saving
the planet from Dr. Cat,

01:50.691 --> 01:52.533
which means I can't say

01:52.533 --> 01:57.738
my Dr. Cat graphic novel
is based on a true story.

01:57.738 --> 02:02.122
t also means
rincess is not answering
y howls for some other reason.

02:02.122 --> 02:04.915
And to make matters worse,
I wasted the whole afternoon.

02:04.915 --> 02:08.919
Get the mailman!
Get the mailman!
Get the mailman!

02:26.937 --> 02:29.029
Guys, guess what!
Seventeen.

02:29.029 --> 02:33.694
No. I've been designing outfits
non stop since lunch.

02:33.694 --> 02:35.486
Someday
17 is gonna be right

02:35.486 --> 02:38.989
and I am going
to blow minds.

02:38.989 --> 02:41.832
Wow, that dress
you made is amazing.

02:41.832 --> 02:43.494
Ever since we took
that Life Skills class,

02:43.494 --> 02:44.995
that's all you've been
thinking about.

02:44.995 --> 02:46.126
I know.

02:46.126 --> 02:47.708
I've been bitten
by the fashion bug.

02:47.708 --> 02:50.461
And now I have
super fashion powers.

02:50.461 --> 02:52.923
Thank you, fashion bug.

02:52.923 --> 02:55.716
I really love these.
Would you make me an outfit?

02:55.716 --> 02:57.057
Here you go.

02:57.057 --> 02:58.429
How'd you know
I was going to ask that?

02:58.429 --> 03:00.140
Super fashion powers!

03:00.140 --> 03:02.473
And I just figured
you'd want one.

03:04.435 --> 03:06.227
I love my dress!

03:06.227 --> 03:07.518
Can I give you
some money for it?

03:07.518 --> 03:09.480
Well, now that
you mention it,

03:09.480 --> 03:11.862
the material was
pretty expensive and...

03:11.862 --> 03:13.193
I've insulted you.

03:13.193 --> 03:15.366
I'll never bring up
money again.

03:15.366 --> 03:18.699
Well, I'm so glad you like it.

03:18.699 --> 03:20.661
Max, what do you think?

03:20.661 --> 03:22.743
I'd be happy
to make one for you.

03:22.743 --> 03:24.785
Look, Avery, as much
as I like your clothes,

03:24.785 --> 03:26.206
they're just not for me.

03:26.206 --> 03:28.459
I mean, this dress screams
Lindsay.

03:28.459 --> 03:30.291
I'd prefer something
that actually screams

03:30.291 --> 03:31.922
to go with this bag.

03:31.922 --> 03:33.964
( screaming )

03:33.964 --> 03:36.257
Shhh.

03:39.099 --> 03:41.262
What are you working
on over there, sweetie?

03:41.262 --> 03:43.764
I've been bitten
by the fashion bug.

03:43.764 --> 03:47.688
Now I have
super fashion powers.

03:47.688 --> 03:49.400
Avery, you're not supposed
to tell the people

03:49.400 --> 03:51.312
you love about
your secret powers.

03:51.312 --> 03:53.354
Now I'm always
going to be in danger.

03:53.354 --> 03:56.777
Ooh, fun!
Thanks for playing along.

03:56.777 --> 03:58.238
Here's the cool part.

03:58.238 --> 04:01.201
I've started making outfits
for other people besides me.

04:01.201 --> 04:02.913
Ta-da!

04:02.913 --> 04:05.035
So...
what do you think?

04:05.035 --> 04:06.367
I really like it.

04:06.367 --> 04:08.629
I'd have to say I like it
whether I did or not,

04:08.629 --> 04:10.250
but I really like it,

04:10.250 --> 04:13.043
so I don't have to say it
with my voice going like this.

04:13.043 --> 04:14.875
Thanks for making it
for me, hon.

04:14.875 --> 04:16.377
I haven't had
a strip of film around me

04:16.377 --> 04:18.969
since my ill-fated stint
as a projectionist.

04:18.969 --> 04:22.303
I lost a whole reel of
Romancing the Stone.

04:22.303 --> 04:24.184
I gotta hand it
to you guys.

04:24.184 --> 04:26.307
You're so adventurous
with your clothes.

04:26.307 --> 04:28.188
I'm not big
on trying new things.

04:28.188 --> 04:30.441
What do you mean?
You try new stuff all the time.

04:30.441 --> 04:32.232
You never used to eat kale.

04:32.232 --> 04:34.234
( gibbers )

04:34.234 --> 04:36.357
I don't eat kale.

04:37.448 --> 04:39.570
Ellen, do I eat kale?

04:39.570 --> 04:42.613
Have you been
slipping me kale?

04:42.613 --> 04:45.366
Okay,
I'll let you two discuss this.

04:45.366 --> 04:47.247
I have a lot of--

04:50.541 --> 04:53.253
You have been putting kale
into my romaine lettuce bag?

04:53.253 --> 04:54.965
I thought I was eating
romaine lettuce!

04:54.965 --> 04:56.296
What is the big deal?

04:56.296 --> 04:58.379
Romaine lettuce is 90%
of the way to eating kale.

04:58.379 --> 05:02.262
And I guess
the other 10% is lies!

05:02.262 --> 05:04.885
What else have you tricked me
into trying?
Nothing much.

05:04.885 --> 05:07.558
Just crafting mosaic tables,
decorative sponge painting,

05:07.558 --> 05:09.980
dream boards, making yogurt,
collecting sea glass,

05:09.980 --> 05:14.064
marrying me, whale watching
and documentaries.

05:14.064 --> 05:17.738
If I'm trying all these
new things for you,

05:17.738 --> 05:21.321
maybe it's time for to you try
a few things that I like--

05:21.321 --> 05:24.114
Wait a minute,
did you say, "marrying me?"

05:24.114 --> 05:27.037
Yup.
And you said, "I do."

05:27.037 --> 05:28.659
Gotcha!

05:28.659 --> 05:30.751
And when did
I ever make yogurt?

05:30.751 --> 05:32.953
Tomorrow.
You'll love it, you'll see.

05:36.417 --> 05:38.128
That is so awesome.

05:38.128 --> 05:39.670
I'll start making your outfits
right away.

05:39.670 --> 05:41.632
You're going to love them.

05:41.632 --> 05:44.465
Lindsay,
Courtney and Mandy

05:44.465 --> 05:46.427
asked me to make outfits
for them, too!

05:46.427 --> 05:49.730
My super fashion power
is becoming so strong.

05:49.730 --> 05:51.772
Soon I'll need a sidekick
to keep me humble.

05:51.772 --> 05:53.894
Hat Girl!

05:53.894 --> 05:55.686
That's great, Avery.

05:55.686 --> 05:57.608
I mean, not
the super fashion powers thing

05:57.608 --> 05:58.939
'cause we're all getting
kind of tired of that,

05:58.939 --> 06:00.651
but I'm glad
people like your clothes.

06:02.152 --> 06:05.195
Uh, one thing though.
Yeah.

06:05.195 --> 06:07.367
Courtney asked
if I make stuff for you,

06:07.367 --> 06:09.249
why don't
I make stuff for Max?

06:09.249 --> 06:12.543
And Mandy said,
"'Cause obviously Max is weird."

06:12.543 --> 06:14.204
Do people think Max is weird?

06:14.204 --> 06:15.956
Avery,
we think Max is weird.

06:15.956 --> 06:17.998
She intentionally guesses
the wrong letters on Hangman

06:17.998 --> 06:20.340
just to see
stick man swing.

06:20.340 --> 06:23.634
Yeah, but that's fun-weird,
not bad-weird.

06:23.634 --> 06:25.966
Like the way she answers
her phone by saying,

06:25.966 --> 06:27.718
"I'm in your house."

06:29.930 --> 06:32.563
I tried to tell Courtney
and Mandy how cool she is,

06:32.563 --> 06:34.645
they said,
"Just look at her."

06:34.645 --> 06:36.356
Yeah, I've heard
other people talk about Max.

06:36.356 --> 06:37.938
I'm worried about her, too.

06:37.938 --> 06:39.279
We're in high school now.

06:39.279 --> 06:41.281
When people get reputations,
they stick.

06:41.281 --> 06:42.573
Max is our friend.

06:42.573 --> 06:44.525
She may think
my clothes aren't for her,

06:44.525 --> 06:48.198
but they could help people
start to see her as the smart,

06:48.198 --> 06:51.121
funny, and creative Max
that we know.

06:51.121 --> 06:53.373
The Max who has a sign
on her bedroom door that says,

06:53.373 --> 06:56.416
"Abandon all hope
ye who enter here."

06:56.416 --> 06:58.999
I have to convince her
to let me make her an outfit.

06:58.999 --> 07:00.300
She already said no.

07:00.300 --> 07:02.382
Well, then I'll have to find
a way to change her mind.

07:02.382 --> 07:04.465
Until then,
let's just play it cool.

07:04.465 --> 07:06.046
Hey, guys.

07:06.046 --> 07:07.217
BOTH: Nothing!

07:08.509 --> 07:10.220
You guys are weird.

07:10.220 --> 07:13.263
( cell phone ringing )
Hold on,
I've gotta take this.

07:13.263 --> 07:16.146
I'm in your house.

07:21.231 --> 07:24.234
♪ Fell in love with a princess,
da-na, na-na ♪

07:24.234 --> 07:27.367
♪ From the moment we met,

07:27.367 --> 07:30.280
♪ Now living without her,

07:30.280 --> 07:33.624
♪ It's like a trip to the vet ♪

07:33.624 --> 07:35.706
What's the matter, Stan?
You got the blues?

07:35.706 --> 07:37.127
Yes, literally.

07:37.127 --> 07:40.581
Did you not just hear
all that "da-na, na-na"?

07:40.581 --> 07:42.633
When I'm sad, I pet my dog.

07:42.633 --> 07:44.925
But I am the dog.
I can't do that.

07:44.925 --> 07:48.218
That makes me sad.

07:48.218 --> 07:50.931
All better.
You should get a dog.

07:52.052 --> 07:54.434
Stan, look.
Isn't that Princess?

07:54.434 --> 08:01.231
♪ Ah, sweet mystery of life

08:01.231 --> 08:03.774
♪ Da-na, na-na ♪

08:03.774 --> 08:07.487
That's the only riff I know.
I don't play a lot of guitar.

08:07.487 --> 08:09.990
Hey, she's not with
her mean owner.

08:09.990 --> 08:12.322
She's with a dog walker.
This could be your chance.

08:12.322 --> 08:13.784
But what if
she's no longer interested?

08:13.784 --> 08:15.786
Oh, I'm so nervous.
How do I play it?

08:15.786 --> 08:18.118
Just go over there
and be cool.

08:18.118 --> 08:20.250
Like, "'Sup, how you been?"

08:20.250 --> 08:22.332
And you definitely
don't want to be like,

08:22.332 --> 08:25.295
"Why you been
ducking my howls?"

08:25.295 --> 08:27.718
Or you could do a big,
romantic gesture

08:27.718 --> 08:29.339
like hitting her
with spitballs.

08:29.339 --> 08:31.431
Uh, Chloe,
spitballs aren't romantic.

08:31.431 --> 08:35.305
They aren't?
Oh, I am so mad at Mason.

08:35.305 --> 08:36.897
All right, guys,
I'm going in.

08:36.897 --> 08:38.478
How's my breath?
( exhales )

08:38.478 --> 08:40.140
Stinks.

08:40.140 --> 08:42.022
Fantastic.
Wish me luck.

08:43.403 --> 08:44.855
What?

08:44.855 --> 08:46.316
Is that why Princess
has been avoiding me?

08:46.316 --> 08:48.739
'Cause she's seeing
that fancy dude?

08:48.739 --> 08:52.202
Whoa, she's licking his ear.
That's our thing!

08:52.202 --> 08:54.575
You know, I've seen that dog
around here somewhere.

08:54.575 --> 08:57.658
Yeah, that's Fernando.
He's a show dog like Princess.

08:57.658 --> 09:00.160
He's won Most Likely to Steal
Another Dog's Girlfriend

09:00.160 --> 09:02.122
three years running.

09:02.122 --> 09:04.424
How am I gonna compete
with that?

09:04.424 --> 09:06.216
Even his name is romantic--

09:06.216 --> 09:09.379
(melodramatic):
Fernando.

09:09.379 --> 09:12.222
You can't give up, Stan.
You're as good as he is.

09:12.222 --> 09:14.554
No, I'm not as good as he is.

09:14.554 --> 09:16.226
But you know who is?

09:16.226 --> 09:18.478
The debonair dog
I shall become.

09:18.478 --> 09:22.442
(melodramatic):
Stan-ando.

09:22.442 --> 09:24.735
(Latin accent):
We will make me over
into the most suave,

09:24.735 --> 09:27.317
well-groomed,
romantic dog on this planet.

09:27.317 --> 09:28.568
Stan, I don't know if--

09:28.568 --> 09:30.450
Please.
Say it with me.

09:30.450 --> 09:34.244
ALL: Stan-ando.

09:41.461 --> 09:44.084
Just because you're doing
a Spanish accent

09:44.084 --> 09:45.796
doesn't mean
you have to act like Zorro.

09:45.796 --> 09:48.669
I did not know this.

09:54.264 --> 09:56.596
Are you sure
performing a play for Max

09:56.596 --> 09:58.478
is the best way to convince her
to wear your clothes?

09:58.478 --> 10:01.351
We spent all night writing,
rehearsing,

10:01.351 --> 10:03.644
printing playbills
and invited Max over,

10:03.644 --> 10:05.355
and this is the first time
you're bringing that up?

10:05.355 --> 10:08.228
It just occurred to me.

10:08.228 --> 10:10.360
Guys, what are you doing
back there?

10:10.360 --> 10:13.193
I'm alone with my thoughts,
and that's never a good thing.

10:13.193 --> 10:18.659
And now presenting
Avery and Lindsay in...

10:18.659 --> 10:20.741
A New Dress For Max.

10:20.741 --> 10:23.623
If you stop this right now,
you can make an outfit for me.

10:23.623 --> 10:26.296
Yes! That is the power
of theater, Lindsay.

10:29.960 --> 10:33.844
Okay,
since I've been unwittingly
trying new things for you,

10:33.844 --> 10:36.386
today you are gonna try
something new for me.

10:36.386 --> 10:37.678
Absolutely, honey.

10:37.678 --> 10:39.389
Whatever it is,
I know I'll love it.

10:39.389 --> 10:41.181
This is your day.

10:41.181 --> 10:43.223
Well, really your hour.
We have Pilates at 4:00.

10:43.223 --> 10:45.225
So, tick-tock.

10:45.225 --> 10:49.029
We are going to eat...hot wings.

10:49.029 --> 10:51.651
Bennett, you know I'm
hyper-sensitive to spicy foods.

10:51.651 --> 10:54.194
That's because you haven't
built up a tolerance.

10:54.194 --> 10:56.276
Now I have
three plates here:

10:56.276 --> 10:59.159
extra hot, medium,
and little wingman,

10:59.159 --> 11:02.202
something so mild it's typically
eaten by four-year-olds.

11:02.202 --> 11:04.284
Well, I can probably
handle that.

11:08.839 --> 11:10.250
Waa-

11:16.757 --> 11:21.391
Sweet Vulcan's hammer!
Are these four-year-old
dragons?!

11:21.391 --> 11:24.144
Oh. Okay, honey,
don't get mad,

11:24.144 --> 11:25.645
but I think
I switched the plates

11:25.645 --> 11:27.437
and you just ate
the extra hot.

11:27.437 --> 11:29.359
What have you done
to me?!

11:29.359 --> 11:30.731
No, no, no, honey,
water just makes it worse!

11:33.313 --> 11:35.315
Why did you even put water
out here?!

11:35.315 --> 11:39.119
Well, you still need
eight glasses a day.

11:39.119 --> 11:41.281
It's the dairy
in the ranch dressing

11:41.281 --> 11:43.163
that neutralizes
the spice in the wings.

11:45.205 --> 11:47.878
It's not working.
It's worse!

11:47.878 --> 11:50.330
Oh, you know what?

11:50.330 --> 11:53.713
This is my homemade
super spicy horseradish sauce.

11:53.713 --> 11:56.386
Why is that
even out here?!

11:56.386 --> 11:58.258
I like to
dip my celery in it.

11:58.258 --> 12:00.390
The ranch dressing
is so bland.

12:01.391 --> 12:02.722
This is the ranch dressing,
right?

12:02.722 --> 12:06.016
I think so, honey,
but let me just be sure.

12:06.016 --> 12:08.268
Yep, that is definitely
ranch dressing.

12:08.268 --> 12:10.150
But I think it's expired.

12:18.278 --> 12:20.781
Max, are you ready?
Can I come in?

12:23.323 --> 12:25.125
Oh, my gosh, Max.

12:26.496 --> 12:28.748
Is it that bad?

12:28.748 --> 12:31.421
You look incredible!

12:31.421 --> 12:32.833
( laughs )

12:32.833 --> 12:35.045
Really incredible.

12:35.045 --> 12:39.379
I never expected to say this,
but I really like it.

12:39.379 --> 12:41.511
Thank you so much, Avery.

12:41.511 --> 12:45.225
I knew if you just tried it,
you'd like it.

12:45.225 --> 12:46.766
And I should be
thanking you, Max.

12:46.766 --> 12:48.598
You combined
two of my favorite things:

12:48.598 --> 12:51.351
helping my friends
and being right.

12:51.351 --> 12:53.563
Well, I'd better get going.

12:53.563 --> 12:55.946
My Sarcasm Club
is meeting now.

12:55.946 --> 12:59.159
They said they'd be
really upset
if I couldn't make it.

12:59.159 --> 13:01.401
I never know
how to take that.

13:01.401 --> 13:05.035
Well, I'm just so glad
this worked out.
Have fun.

13:08.118 --> 13:11.251
Super Fashion Girl
strikes again.

13:11.251 --> 13:14.674
Yeah, I see why people
are getting tired of that.

13:14.674 --> 13:17.587
Hey, Max,
you forgot your phone!

13:19.719 --> 13:21.301
Hey, who was the girl
who just left?

13:21.301 --> 13:22.923
Max.

13:22.923 --> 13:25.515
Look, if you don't want
to tell me, just say so.

13:25.515 --> 13:28.808
I'm trying to catch her,
she forgot her phone.

13:30.430 --> 13:31.892
What are you doing?

13:31.892 --> 13:33.563
Hey.

13:33.563 --> 13:36.276
Oh, hey, Max.

13:41.071 --> 13:44.074
Why are you covering up
the outfit I made you?

13:44.074 --> 13:45.205
I thought you liked it.

13:45.205 --> 13:46.406
I'm sorry, Avery.

13:46.406 --> 13:48.208
I didn't want to hurt
your feelings,

13:48.208 --> 13:50.370
but the clothes you made
just aren't me.

13:50.370 --> 13:52.332
We're in high school now.

13:52.332 --> 13:53.914
Don't you think
it's time for a change?

13:53.914 --> 13:55.375
I like the way I look.

13:55.375 --> 13:58.088
Then why did you agree
to have me make you this outfit

13:58.088 --> 13:59.589
that I worked on
all night?

13:59.589 --> 14:01.801
Because when I said no,
you wouldn't listen.

14:01.801 --> 14:03.884
You wrote a stupid play.

14:03.884 --> 14:05.425
I know how you are,

14:05.425 --> 14:06.927
I could see you weren't going
to leave me alone about it.

14:06.927 --> 14:08.308
I was trying to help you!

14:08.308 --> 14:10.100
I thought you wanted
to change my clothes,

14:10.100 --> 14:11.231
but you want to change me!

14:11.231 --> 14:12.522
Yes, for the better!

14:14.314 --> 14:15.685
Maybe I need better friends.

14:23.113 --> 14:25.285
You ready
for your makeover, Stan?

14:25.285 --> 14:28.328
Stan-ando.

14:28.328 --> 14:30.450
You've got the accent,

14:30.450 --> 14:33.123
but if you want to win Princess
back from that show dog,

14:33.123 --> 14:35.335
you're gonna have to
become a show dog.

14:35.335 --> 14:38.378
There's only one person
who can help you do that.

14:38.378 --> 14:42.552
(British accent):
Mrs. Grimmons at your service.

14:42.552 --> 14:45.505
That's right,
Chloe's imaginary character

14:45.505 --> 14:48.138
is going to transform
your imaginary character.

14:48.138 --> 14:50.890
There's no way
this plan can fail.

14:52.272 --> 14:55.065
Note the insouciant swagger,

14:55.065 --> 14:58.858
the confidence that comes
from a place of ignorance.

14:58.858 --> 15:01.361
Chloe, how do you know
those big words?

15:01.361 --> 15:04.024
Avery writes a lot of
Mrs. Grimmons' material.

15:06.196 --> 15:08.368
Makin' me smell pretty.

15:08.368 --> 15:10.410
And don't forget
the moneymaker.

15:14.744 --> 15:17.958
Ooh, that feels
pretty good back there.

15:17.958 --> 15:19.749
It does, doesn't it?

15:19.749 --> 15:22.592
I always say it
but no one listens to me.

15:22.592 --> 15:26.006
I heard you,
and I'm all about it.

15:26.006 --> 15:29.259
Chloe, please!
Some decorum.

15:30.890 --> 15:33.893
Okay, Stan.
I took my hair dryer
and modified it.

15:35.185 --> 15:38.228
By removing three hair dryers.

15:38.228 --> 15:40.270
Just don't put it
on the highest setting, or--

15:40.270 --> 15:41.611
( hits switch )

15:45.365 --> 15:48.198
Well,
this is a sticky wicket.

15:49.239 --> 15:50.330
( turns dryer off )

15:53.203 --> 15:54.534
All right, Stan.

15:54.534 --> 15:56.336
Get ready to look beautiful.

16:03.043 --> 16:04.424
BOTH: He's ready.

16:06.846 --> 16:09.759
I'm beautiful.

16:09.759 --> 16:12.352
Well,
my work here is done.

16:13.933 --> 16:15.265
Cheerio.

16:16.646 --> 16:19.519
Goodbye, Mrs. Grimmons!

16:19.519 --> 16:22.192
Bye, Mrs. Grimmons,
come back again soon.

16:22.192 --> 16:24.404
Why am I doing this?

16:28.238 --> 16:30.660
Bennett, this is so scary!

16:30.660 --> 16:32.742
I don't want to do
any more things you want to do.

16:32.742 --> 16:34.914
I didn't want
to do this either!

16:34.914 --> 16:38.208
We were taking a flying lesson
but you were screaming so much

16:38.208 --> 16:41.291
the pilot kicked us
out of the plane!

16:41.291 --> 16:43.083
Yeah, we really should
report him,

16:43.083 --> 16:45.505
'cause that just seems wrong.

16:45.505 --> 16:47.257
Well, at least he gave us
the parachutes.

16:47.257 --> 16:49.839
No, he gave me a parachute.

16:49.839 --> 16:52.552
I had to do a lot of talking
to get you yours.

16:55.725 --> 16:57.597
Okay, Stan-ando,
there's Princess.

16:57.597 --> 17:00.140
She's with Fernando,
but you can lure her away.

17:00.140 --> 17:03.143
If I've learned anything
from the movies I've watched,

17:03.143 --> 17:05.905
it's that being attractive
is all that matters.

17:05.905 --> 17:08.358
Or being a vampire.

17:08.358 --> 17:11.151
Stan-ando has this
under his control.

17:11.151 --> 17:13.613
He will strut
with the confidence of--

17:13.613 --> 17:14.744
Gopher!

17:15.785 --> 17:17.367
Stan!
Wait!

17:17.367 --> 17:19.249
( Stan barking )

17:22.041 --> 17:24.424
Stan, you're a mess.

17:24.424 --> 17:26.216
And your hair is all ruined.

17:26.216 --> 17:27.337
What was I thinking?

17:27.337 --> 17:29.719
There's no way Princess
is gonna want me now.

17:29.719 --> 17:31.301
Stan, look,
she's coming over.

17:31.301 --> 17:35.225
Look at that, Stan.
She likes you for you.

17:35.225 --> 17:37.177
You didn't need
to become Stan-ando.

17:37.177 --> 17:39.018
When she was separated
from you for so long,

17:39.018 --> 17:41.181
she probably just forgot
about you. Dogs do that.

17:41.181 --> 17:44.023
Dogs don't forget about things.
Uh-oh.

17:44.023 --> 17:46.106
What?
I forgot about something.

17:49.319 --> 17:50.530
Whew.

17:50.530 --> 17:53.613
Almost burned
my banana bread.

17:57.157 --> 17:59.249
Something smells really good.

18:01.121 --> 18:04.414
And that's how I learned that
cornichon is a kind of pickle.

18:04.414 --> 18:06.126
Thank goodness
you're back.

18:06.126 --> 18:08.628
The conversation was
really starting to lag.

18:08.628 --> 18:11.261
Thanks for everything, guys.

18:11.261 --> 18:13.513
Now if you'll excuse me.

18:13.513 --> 18:15.595
So tell me, my darling,

18:15.595 --> 18:18.308
do you prefer the front
or back end of the gopher?

18:18.308 --> 18:20.560
It's not a deal breaker
either way.

18:22.602 --> 18:25.104
Adios, Stan-ando.

18:25.104 --> 18:28.858
He was the second best student
I've ever had.

18:28.858 --> 18:30.820
Thank you, Mrs. Grimmons.

18:34.113 --> 18:36.786
I can't believe
how ungrateful Max was.

18:36.786 --> 18:38.288
That's what I get
for trying to help.

18:38.288 --> 18:40.790
Well, some people are
just not appreciative.

18:40.790 --> 18:42.502
Like when I made
banana bread

18:42.502 --> 18:45.875
and Bennett and Ellen
didn't save me a piece.

18:45.875 --> 18:48.418
And she accused me
of being a bad friend.

18:48.418 --> 18:50.510
I'm the one
who's protecting her.

18:50.510 --> 18:53.463
Oh, did you tell her
about the other girls
calling her weird?

18:53.463 --> 18:55.805
No. That's how good
a friend I am.

18:55.805 --> 18:57.717
I protected her from that.

18:57.717 --> 19:00.220
And what's so bad about
changing how you dress?

19:00.220 --> 19:02.222
I used to wear ties,
now I don't.

19:02.222 --> 19:03.853
Oh, I thought
you stopped wearing them

19:03.853 --> 19:05.185
'cause everywhere
you went,

19:05.185 --> 19:08.438
people kept asking you
if you worked there.

19:08.438 --> 19:12.071
That was only part of it.

19:12.071 --> 19:14.444
There's nothing wrong
with evolving your look.

19:14.444 --> 19:18.328
Well, there's also nothing wrong
with being who you are.

19:18.328 --> 19:19.579
You may have
gotten rid of your ties,

19:19.579 --> 19:21.331
but you never
stopped studying,

19:21.331 --> 19:23.663
even when people
gave you a hard time

19:23.663 --> 19:25.785
for being
a good student.

19:25.785 --> 19:29.379
Wow. I never thought about it
that way.

19:29.379 --> 19:33.343
Look, I tried to change
who I was for Princess.

19:33.343 --> 19:36.466
And you realized if she
doesn't like who you are,

19:36.466 --> 19:39.138
then she's not the one
for you.

19:39.138 --> 19:41.100
Oh, no, I'd change for her
in a second.

19:42.472 --> 19:44.264
But it turns out
she likes the way I am.

19:44.264 --> 19:46.065
So my thing worked out.

19:46.065 --> 19:47.267
Good luck with yours.

19:52.272 --> 19:54.484
So I guess you heard about
what happened yesterday.

19:54.484 --> 19:56.736
You mean about Avery's parents
being rushed to the hospital

19:56.736 --> 19:59.579
after eating
bad banana bread?

19:59.579 --> 20:02.201
No, about what happened
between me and Avery.

20:02.201 --> 20:04.203
She was way out of line.

20:04.203 --> 20:06.165
Well, you can't blame her
for wanting to protect you

20:06.165 --> 20:07.707
from what
all those girls were saying.

20:07.707 --> 20:09.289
What were they saying?

20:09.289 --> 20:10.590
Oh, she didn't tell you?

20:10.590 --> 20:12.462
Then, neither did I.

20:14.133 --> 20:16.506
Everybody, listen up!

20:16.506 --> 20:21.471
I'm Avery and I'm proud to say
that Max is my friend.

20:21.471 --> 20:23.182
Does she dress in black?

20:23.182 --> 20:25.144
Yes, she does.

20:25.144 --> 20:26.686
Does she collect
broken piñata heads

20:26.686 --> 20:28.438
from other people's
parties?

20:28.438 --> 20:31.110
Yes, she does.

20:31.110 --> 20:35.775
And if anyone thinks
we're weird, we don't care.

20:35.775 --> 20:40.320
And if you go around
calling other people weird,
you're the ones who look bad.

20:40.320 --> 20:43.703
But you won't look bad in these
outfits you ordered from me.
Hope you enjoy them.

20:46.245 --> 20:50.710
The point is,
it's okay to be different.

20:50.710 --> 20:53.923
Max, I'm so sorry that
I tried to change you.

20:53.923 --> 20:57.467
I know now you were
just trying to help.

20:57.467 --> 21:00.970
So what do you think?

21:00.970 --> 21:02.342
You don't look like you.

21:02.342 --> 21:04.384
I know.
I look ridiculous.

21:04.384 --> 21:06.265
I meant you look like me.

21:06.265 --> 21:08.227
Exactly.

21:08.227 --> 21:11.521
Not ridiculous,
I just don't look like me.

21:11.521 --> 21:14.524
And I can't get my purse
to sound right.

21:14.524 --> 21:17.857
Hello, I missed you.

21:17.857 --> 21:19.989
Put your hand in me.

21:22.241 --> 21:24.824
You are so weird.

21:31.461 --> 21:33.212
Bennett and Ellen learned

21:33.212 --> 21:35.214
you shouldn't try
to change someone

21:35.214 --> 21:36.796
without them knowing it.

21:36.796 --> 21:39.218
Avery learned you shouldn't
try to change someone

21:39.218 --> 21:40.970
with them knowing it.

21:40.970 --> 21:43.092
And I learned you shouldn't
try to change for someone

21:43.092 --> 21:46.015
who doesn't know
who you are.

21:46.015 --> 21:48.137
Now things are great
with Princess and me.

21:48.137 --> 21:51.230
In fact,
we had a gopher for dinner.

21:53.773 --> 21:55.525
Howard's a great guy.

21:55.525 --> 21:57.397
The three of us are
renting a cabin next week

21:57.397 --> 21:58.738
at Lake Arrowhead.

21:58.738 --> 22:00.400
Howard's got a jet ski.
