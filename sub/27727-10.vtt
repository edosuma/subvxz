JEREMY: Thank you so much.

01:14.880 --> 01:20.040
Thank you and coming up
in this incredibly
exciting show:

01:37.440 --> 01:40.360
However...

01:40.400 --> 01:43.560
However, we begin
with a film from James May,

01:43.600 --> 01:45.120
who's in his 80s.

01:45.160 --> 01:46.520
-What?
-(LAUGHTER)

01:46.560 --> 01:48.080
No, wait, sorry.

01:48.120 --> 01:50.920
We begin with a film from
James May about the '80s.

01:50.960 --> 01:52.240
Yes. Thank you.

01:52.280 --> 01:54.680
The '80s, a time of
marvellous excess -

01:54.720 --> 01:56.720
you know, Gordon Gekko
and big shoulder pads

01:56.760 --> 01:58.680
and of course
incredible supercars -

01:58.720 --> 02:01.040
the greatest of which,
without question,

02:01.080 --> 02:02.520
was this one.

02:07.240 --> 02:09.160
The Ferrari Testarossa...

02:11.320 --> 02:13.240
...was excess on wheels...

02:16.320 --> 02:17.520
...be it looks...

02:19.680 --> 02:21.160

02:23.160 --> 02:24.440
...or even size.

02:28.600 --> 02:31.160
(ROCK MUSIC PLAYING)

02:31.240 --> 02:34.160
When this car came out,
people were absolutely aghast

02:34.240 --> 02:37.000
at how wide this car was.

02:37.040 --> 02:38.800
I don't mean wide
like Del Boy,

02:38.840 --> 02:41.720
I mean wide as in width.

02:41.760 --> 02:43.680
It was enormous!
Especially at the back.

02:44.760 --> 02:46.680
And it simply oozed charisma

02:46.720 --> 02:49.400
from every one
of its slatted panels.

02:49.440 --> 02:51.920
It was unquestionably...

02:51.960 --> 02:55.160
...the only car that
could star in Miami Vice.

02:55.200 --> 02:57.200
(MIAMI VICE THEME)

02:57.240 --> 03:01.320
In fact, Enzo Ferrari
loved that show so much,

03:01.360 --> 03:04.600
he actually gave its star,
Don Johnson,

03:04.640 --> 03:06.640
his own Testarossa.

03:06.680 --> 03:10.080
And Don was just the tip
of the celebrity iceberg.

03:13.520 --> 03:16.560
Rod Stewart had one,
Elton John had one,

03:16.600 --> 03:18.600
Mike Tyson had one,

03:18.640 --> 03:21.320
OJ Simpson had one.

03:21.360 --> 03:23.200
And presumably
wore driving gloves.

03:25.320 --> 03:28.200
The price of this car,
when it went on sale in 1985,

03:28.240 --> 03:32.840
was £62,666.

03:32.880 --> 03:35.640
That is,
as I'm sure you know,
the number of the beast.

03:35.680 --> 03:38.800
And, when you unleashed
its five-litre V12...

03:38.840 --> 03:40.200
(ENGINE REVVING)

03:42.320 --> 03:44.720
...it would do
180 miles an hour.

03:49.080 --> 03:51.000
That was an astonishing
figure for the time.

03:53.800 --> 03:57.760
It had the speed
and the celebrity fan base.

03:57.800 --> 04:01.440
But the Testarossa was not
what you'd call politically
correct.

04:03.000 --> 04:05.720
Consider, for example,
that the window switches

04:05.760 --> 04:09.200
are tiny little things hidden
here on the centre console.

04:09.240 --> 04:10.840
Where you'd expect
them to be,

04:10.880 --> 04:14.160
that...well, obviously,
it's a huge ashtray.

04:14.200 --> 04:16.560
In fact, if they'd given
that a mirrored lid,

04:16.600 --> 04:18.600
it could have had two uses.

04:21.760 --> 04:25.920
If the 1980s were
the era of excess, then,

04:25.920 --> 04:28.560
well, this was
the perfect car for the era.

04:31.440 --> 04:35.920
I'm afraid Mr May has just
been wasting your time rather

04:36.000 --> 04:39.200
because that is not
the ultimate '80s supercar.

04:39.240 --> 04:40.920
This is.

04:43.560 --> 04:45.560
For sheer over-the-topness,

04:45.600 --> 04:49.160
nothing comes close to
the Lamborghini Countach.

04:51.480 --> 04:53.040
Alongside it,

04:53.080 --> 04:55.360
the Testarossa looks
like a family hatchback.

04:56.920 --> 04:58.920
If you think
the Ferrari is wide,

04:58.920 --> 05:02.920
this is even wider.

05:02.920 --> 05:06.240
And the Testarossa's doors
don't open like this.

05:07.360 --> 05:09.000
(ENGINE REVVING)

05:11.080 --> 05:13.680
This version of the Countach,
the LP5000,

05:13.720 --> 05:16.520
was launched in 1985,

05:16.560 --> 05:20.160
specifically to put the
Testarossa back in its box.

05:22.200 --> 05:25.640
Its 48-valve,
5.2 litre-V12...

05:27.240 --> 05:30.200
...can take the Countach
to 186 miles an hour,

05:30.240 --> 05:34.400
or to be precise,
more than the Ferrari.

05:34.440 --> 05:38.400
In fact, in its day, this was
the fastest production car
in the world.

05:40.520 --> 05:42.120
I've got a Kevlar bonnet,

05:42.160 --> 05:46.040

We're talking
ultimate supercar here.

05:51.920 --> 05:55.320
And this incredible
machine...

05:55.360 --> 05:59.480
...came from a company
that didn't have half
the resources of Ferrari.

06:00.600 --> 06:02.600
Let me give you an example.

06:02.640 --> 06:06.640
This car might look
super aerodynamic,
like a missile.

06:06.680 --> 06:09.560
But in fact, it never saw
the inside of a wind tunnel.

06:09.600 --> 06:11.600
They couldn't afford
to put it in one.

06:11.640 --> 06:15.600
So instead, they ran
a prototype up and down
the motorway,

06:15.640 --> 06:17.560
with bits of wool
stuck all over it.

06:18.960 --> 06:20.200
I love that!

06:23.440 --> 06:25.560
Oh, hello. Here he comes.

that Lamborghini is,

06:39.880 --> 06:42.920
it's a bit "all mouth
and no trousers."

06:42.960 --> 06:44.960
Fastest car in the world,

06:48.960 --> 06:51.680
Even Lamborghini will admit
they ran slightly hooky cars

06:51.720 --> 06:53.600
when they did
the performance testing.

06:53.640 --> 06:55.920
They took the mirrors off and
stripped weight out of them.

06:55.960 --> 06:57.640
Absolute flim-flam.

06:57.680 --> 06:59.600
(TYRES SCREECH)

07:03.400 --> 07:05.400
The thing is,
supercars, to me,

07:05.440 --> 07:07.840
are all about
being the ultimate.

07:07.880 --> 07:10.880
It doesn't matter what
that is, but it has to be
an ultimate.

07:12.680 --> 07:16.320
And this is the ultimate

one of these as a kid,

07:19.120 --> 07:21.600
it lit a flame in my heart.

And when I saw one today,
as a middle-aged man,

roared into life.

The problem is, the
Lamborghini Countach
wasn't really a car.

07:47.200 --> 07:51.280
It wasn't really for
driving...but this was.

07:51.320 --> 07:54.080
It's got a proper boot,
a decent-sized fuel tank,

07:54.120 --> 07:55.600
it's got comfortable seats.

Oh, that's not...

in there.

had a periscope.

There's a cool thing
I can do here.

08:36.960 --> 08:40.520

like...this...

08:40.520 --> 08:44.200
...and then you can put it
in reverse, there...

-Yes, it is moving. Yes, yes.

-Bit of left hand down.

-What? Oh, yeah.

09:02.120 --> 09:04.520
I was just explaining to the
viewers before we stopped

09:04.520 --> 09:06.080
what a sham this car is.

09:06.120 --> 09:08.120
That rear wing has no effect

09:08.160 --> 09:10.720
other than
to slow the car down

09:10.760 --> 09:13.080
and make the front go light
when you're at high speed.

09:13.120 --> 09:15.120
It's actually worse than that
cos it's illegal.

09:15.160 --> 09:18.000
They didn't have the money
to homologate it properly.

09:18.040 --> 09:20.040
So they'd build the cars
in the factory

09:20.080 --> 09:21.760
then wheel them out
into the car park

09:21.760 --> 09:23.440
and a man screwed them on
with a power drill.

09:23.480 --> 09:25.520
Genuinely.
And I love that about it!

-In the car park?
-In the car park,
finished it off. I love that!

09:28.400 --> 09:31.840
Why don't we tell the viewers
how the indicator stalk on
your supercar...

09:31.880 --> 09:34.480
(LAUGHING) ...comes
from a Morris Marina?

09:34.520 --> 09:36.200

we talk about the fact

09:36.240 --> 09:39.040
that the electric door mirror
adjustors on yours

are out of an Austin Montego?

you didn't know that.
-I did.

Ahem. Rod Stewart
had a Testarossa.

09:45.960 --> 09:48.640

09:48.720 --> 09:50.720
Oh, yeah.

09:52.640 --> 09:54.600
JAMES:
Unable to agree on anything,

09:54.640 --> 09:56.880
we decided to take a more
intellectual approach...

09:58.520 --> 10:00.640
...by having a drag race.

10:00.720 --> 10:04.280
Now, on paper,
the Lamborghini is faster,
definitely.

10:04.320 --> 10:06.280
But as we've already
observed,

10:06.320 --> 10:09.040
Lamborghini were a bit
fast and loose with
their performance figures

10:09.080 --> 10:10.520
back in the day.

10:10.600 --> 10:13.400
So now, finally,
we can find out for real.

10:15.000 --> 10:17.520
However,
as we sat on the start line,

10:17.520 --> 10:20.760
something occurred to us.

10:20.760 --> 10:22.480
These are privately owned
cars, aren't they?

10:22.520 --> 10:23.960
RICHARD: Correct, yeah.

10:24.000 --> 10:25.520
Well, the thing is,

10:25.600 --> 10:27.600
Testarossas don't really
like standing starts,

10:27.640 --> 10:30.880
cos they tend to blow
their own differentials up.

10:30.960 --> 10:33.280
How much is
a new differential?

10:33.320 --> 10:37.160
It's £26,000.

10:37.200 --> 10:39.200
Actually, I'm quite glad
you've mentioned that.

10:39.240 --> 10:41.240
Because these don't like
standing starts either.

10:41.280 --> 10:43.280
It's those huge rear tyres.

10:43.320 --> 10:45.720
You get a fried clutch
and a split gearbox casing.

10:45.760 --> 10:47.880
JAMES:
How much does that cost?

10:47.880 --> 10:50.200
-£36,000.
-Ooh!

10:50.240 --> 10:55.360
So, in all,
that's £62,000 at risk.

10:55.400 --> 10:58.240
I know. I fancy something
we don't normally do -

10:58.280 --> 11:00.280
a rolling start drag race.

11:00.320 --> 11:03.680
Yes, I do too! I've always
wanted to try a rolling
start drag race.

11:03.720 --> 11:07.000
And for some reason,
today in these cars,
I prefer that option.

at the white line, floor it.

The Countach.

12:33.280 --> 12:35.440
The steering feels like
it's set in concrete,

12:35.480 --> 12:37.680
so does the gear lever,
so do the pedals.

12:37.720 --> 12:39.360
And if you use
the air conditioning,

12:39.400 --> 12:42.280
it's like you're being
breathed on by a hot dog.

12:42.320 --> 12:43.680
(LAUGHTER)

12:43.720 --> 12:45.640
He is right about that.

12:45.680 --> 12:49.560
And you can't talk either,
cos your roly-poly barge
Testarossa

12:49.600 --> 12:53.560
was, as you said, driven
by a man from Miami Vice

12:53.600 --> 12:55.600
who rolled
his jacket sleeves up.

12:55.640 --> 12:58.160
The Duke of Edinburgh
doesn't do that, does he?

12:58.200 --> 13:00.360
-Earl Haig doesn't do that.
-Hang on a minute!

13:00.400 --> 13:02.800
-What?
-By attacking those cars,

13:02.840 --> 13:04.840
you are destroying
the very foundations

13:04.880 --> 13:07.040
of everything we love
and hold precious.

13:07.080 --> 13:10.160
Mm-hm. And now it's time
to destroy them
a little bit more

13:10.200 --> 13:14.440
by seeing how slowly those
cars go round The Eboladrome.

13:14.480 --> 13:16.760
(ENGINE REVS)

13:16.800 --> 13:19.800
And it's off in a
clutch-slipping, smoky start.

13:19.840 --> 13:21.840
Ooh, it's wet.

13:21.880 --> 13:24.440
And look at that lunging
and pitching there.

13:25.680 --> 13:28.240
As she heads on to the Isn't.

13:28.280 --> 13:30.840
Having a look at the gear
lever, make sure
it hasn't fallen off.

13:30.880 --> 13:34.120
Sleeves very sensibly
rolled down.

13:34.160 --> 13:36.920
Look at the body roll on it.
Here we go.

13:36.960 --> 13:38.640
Oh, she's fighting
the wheel there.

13:38.680 --> 13:42.880
More lean, as she lunges down
to Your Name Here.

13:42.920 --> 13:45.720
It really is dodge,
duck, dip, dive.

13:45.760 --> 13:48.800
It's like watching Dodgeball,
only slower.

13:48.840 --> 13:51.680
And less amusing.

13:51.720 --> 13:53.720
Another glance down
at the gear lever.

13:53.760 --> 13:56.280
And now ringing out
that flat 12.

13:59.440 --> 14:02.480
Powerboating back towards
Old Lady's House

14:02.520 --> 14:04.440
in a wake of spray.

14:06.080 --> 14:07.880
I can't imagine
she's enjoying this.

14:07.920 --> 14:09.360
Right, hard on the brakes.

14:09.400 --> 14:12.360
Taking a wisely cautious
line in there.

14:12.400 --> 14:15.480
Has it stopped?
No, still moving, just.

14:15.520 --> 14:20.680
And now, yeah, lumbering
towards Substation.

14:20.720 --> 14:22.520
In fairness,
it does sound quite good.

14:22.560 --> 14:23.920
(ENGINE ROARS)

14:23.960 --> 14:25.960
Very good, actually.

14:26.000 --> 14:28.800
Wallowing through there
like a Rolls-Royce Corniche.

14:28.840 --> 14:30.840
Just Field of Sheep to go.

14:30.880 --> 14:32.880
Yes, she's sliding it!

14:32.920 --> 14:34.840
And across the line.

14:37.400 --> 14:39.320
-She's nuts.
-That was absolutely nuts.

14:41.960 --> 14:45.080
Sliding a Testarossa -
I wouldn't do that
for all the tea in China.

14:45.120 --> 14:47.240
Technical point that might
confuse the viewers.

14:47.280 --> 14:49.520
You just said,
"The roar from the flat 12,"

14:49.560 --> 14:51.800
which is sort of right
but I said, "V12,"

14:51.840 --> 14:53.920
which is also sort of right,
cos it's not a boxer.

14:53.960 --> 14:56.480
So it's a 180-degree
flat V12.

14:56.520 --> 14:57.800
-Like that.
-Literally not interested.

14:57.840 --> 14:59.880
-It's a flat--
-(LAUGHTER)

14:59.920 --> 15:01.160
It's a flattish V12.

15:01.200 --> 15:04.240
Anyway, it's now time to
see how the Lambo got on.

15:04.280 --> 15:06.280
(ENGINE REVVING)

15:06.320 --> 15:09.680
And it's a snappier start
for the Countach,

15:09.720 --> 15:13.720
mashing its fat rear tyres
into that sodden Tarmac.

15:14.800 --> 15:16.560
It really is sodden.

15:16.600 --> 15:19.120
A quick look down to make
sure it's in gear there.

15:19.160 --> 15:23.800
Now easing off through the
second curve on the straight.

15:23.840 --> 15:26.600
And back on the power
towards Your Name here.

15:26.640 --> 15:30.320
No need for Abbie
to go to the gym this week.

15:30.360 --> 15:33.160
She's getting all the workout
she needs in the Lambo.

15:34.920 --> 15:36.920
Turning in hard as she dare.

15:36.960 --> 15:40.040
Rear wing doing
absolutely nothing as usual.

15:43.240 --> 15:46.160
Ooh, I thought it
was gonna take off there!

15:46.200 --> 15:50.240
And now the joyless
wrestle back towards
Old Lady's House.

15:52.240 --> 15:54.240
Through the rain.

15:54.280 --> 15:57.720
A rush of the brakes, I felt,
at the mid-point there.

15:57.760 --> 16:01.760
Now, much harder braking
and down through the gears.

16:01.800 --> 16:05.960
It sounded like an angry
tractor at low revs.

16:06.000 --> 16:07.920
And now in the damp dash
towards Substation.

16:07.960 --> 16:09.240
(ENGINE REVVING)

16:09.280 --> 16:10.760
That makes an even
better noise

16:10.800 --> 16:13.000
than the Ferrari, really.

16:13.040 --> 16:15.040
Brilliant.
Just two corners left.

16:15.080 --> 16:18.040
Will she get this one
sliding in Field of Sheep?

16:18.080 --> 16:21.360
Bit of a wiggle there but
through the Field of Sheep?

16:21.400 --> 16:23.320
No, and there we are,
across the line!

16:25.840 --> 16:27.760
-Brave.
-Brave.

16:29.080 --> 16:31.760
Right.

16:31.800 --> 16:35.760
Let's see where they go on
the board, Lamborghini first.

16:35.800 --> 16:37.720
RICHARD: Hang on, that's
the bottom of the board.

16:37.760 --> 16:39.520
JEREMY: They're not going
to the top, are they?

16:39.560 --> 16:41.640
See, look at that.
30th place.

16:41.680 --> 16:43.160
It's faster than
a Ford Fiesta.

16:43.200 --> 16:45.200
I mean, come on.
That's pretty good.

16:45.240 --> 16:47.480
JEREMY:
That is tragically slow!

16:47.520 --> 16:51.080
-It was a long time ago!
-(JAMES LAUGHS)

16:51.120 --> 16:53.160
It doesn't look good,
does it?

16:53.200 --> 16:55.120
Honda Civic, Ford Focus -
they're all quicker.

16:56.360 --> 16:58.320
All right, one good thing is,

16:58.360 --> 17:00.920
the Testarossa can't be
much slower than that.
Let's find out.

17:03.160 --> 17:05.080
-(LAUGHTER)
RICHARD: My God!

17:06.360 --> 17:08.240
Oh, God!

17:08.280 --> 17:09.960
It is faster than the Up!

17:10.000 --> 17:11.680
And they're both in the wet
so that's a fair comparison.

17:11.720 --> 17:13.720
Loser, I believe.

17:13.760 --> 17:15.800
JEREMY: Look, I think
we have to face facts here.

17:15.800 --> 17:17.800
They're two very slow cars.

17:17.880 --> 17:21.440
But at least
they are expensive

17:21.480 --> 17:24.680
and horrible to drive.

17:24.720 --> 17:29.480
Anyway, now it's time to
bite into a cake of debate,

17:29.520 --> 17:32.640
from the café of chat...

17:32.680 --> 17:36.040
...on the corner of
Conversation Street.

17:36.080 --> 17:38.000
(MELLOW JAZZ)

17:40.080 --> 17:41.520
(LAUGHTER)

17:48.960 --> 17:52.240
I think after 36 of those
we are running out of ideas.

17:52.280 --> 17:54.080
It was getting desperate.

17:54.160 --> 17:56.160
Now, any young people here,

17:56.200 --> 17:58.200
looking forward
to driving maybe one day?

17:58.240 --> 18:01.560
Thinking the future holds a
Ferrari for you, Lamborghini.

18:01.560 --> 18:03.560
Afraid not.
There's a company in Aberdeen

18:03.640 --> 18:07.080
who've decided that
the future actually will
look like this.

18:07.160 --> 18:08.800
RICHARD: Oh, God.
-(LAUGHTER)

18:08.800 --> 18:10.560
JAMES: Bloody hell.
RICHARD: Really?

18:10.560 --> 18:12.040
JAMES: Electric?

18:12.080 --> 18:14.320
JEREMY: Of course
they're electric, obviously.

18:14.400 --> 18:16.400
Range of 35 miles.
They're stackable cars.

18:16.440 --> 18:19.920
Wait, so they work like the
human centipede, then?

18:19.960 --> 18:21.960
(LAUGHTER)

18:22.000 --> 18:24.040
Not exactly like that, no.

18:24.080 --> 18:25.920
No. No...

18:25.960 --> 18:28.040
No.

18:28.080 --> 18:30.080
What I mean is, they're all
connected together.

18:30.080 --> 18:32.080
Yeah, they're connected,
exactly. They're connected.

18:32.160 --> 18:35.040
Hang on, what if you're in
the one in the middle, right?

18:35.080 --> 18:38.080
And you want to go
a different way
to the one in the front.

18:38.080 --> 18:39.760
What are you gonna do?

18:39.800 --> 18:42.040
It's worse than that.
If you're in the middle

18:42.080 --> 18:43.800
and go a different way,
you won't have any wheels.

18:43.880 --> 18:46.000
They'll be left attached
to the ones in the front
and back.

18:46.040 --> 18:48.000
RICHARD:
There's not enough wheels.

18:48.040 --> 18:50.760
I grant you, it looks
ridiculous that the front
and back separate.

18:50.800 --> 18:52.800
"We've got no bloody wheels!"

18:52.800 --> 18:54.720
Actually, it's an optical
illusion, the back wheels
are inboard.

18:54.760 --> 18:56.320
So you do have wheels.

18:56.400 --> 18:58.200
But what if
you were in the back one

18:58.240 --> 19:00.440
and it was being driven
by Richard Hammond
from the front?

19:00.480 --> 19:02.400
-You'd be bloody terrified.
-Oh, all right!

19:03.480 --> 19:05.000
Yes, that is a point.

19:05.040 --> 19:07.440
But I don't think you quite
understand how this works.

19:07.480 --> 19:09.040
I'll need to check it out.

19:10.880 --> 19:12.880
It's quite complicated
so bear with me.

19:12.920 --> 19:16.800
You see, the idea is these
cars are sort of everywhere
for people to use.

19:16.880 --> 19:20.720
And then at night, a man
goes round in the green one,
the one in front,

19:20.760 --> 19:22.920
and he collects all the
others up behind him.

19:22.960 --> 19:26.080
He's a bit like those men
you see at airports,
with all the trolleys,

19:26.080 --> 19:29.240
and he ends up with that
two-mile snake that bashes
into your ankles.

19:29.280 --> 19:31.440
-It's like that.
-So it gathers them all up?

19:31.480 --> 19:34.040
So, hang on a minute.
You drive home
in the evening, say.

19:34.080 --> 19:35.920
-Mm-hm.
-In your car.

19:35.960 --> 19:38.080
You get up next morning
but it's gone because
a bloke's collected it?

19:38.080 --> 19:40.800
-(LAUGHTER)
-Yeah.

19:40.800 --> 19:43.240
That doesn't work
because most journeys
by car are two-way.

19:43.280 --> 19:45.160
You get there,
then you need to get back.

19:45.200 --> 19:47.080
Unless you're driving
to Dignitas.

19:48.760 --> 19:50.280
No, they'd work for that.

19:50.320 --> 19:52.440
Maybe it's a Dignitas
collection service.

19:52.480 --> 19:55.320
The thing is, I'm going to
try and work out how it...

19:55.400 --> 19:58.720
It's quite complicated.
They have actually...

19:58.760 --> 20:02.000
There is a flow chart that
explains how it works.
Put that up.

20:02.040 --> 20:04.520
-Here we are.
RICHARD: Oh, I see!

20:04.560 --> 20:07.560
You're stabbed in the back
with a giant fork,
and briefcase,

20:07.640 --> 20:10.800
then you bump into
one-and-two-thirds cars,

20:10.800 --> 20:14.320
that turn into half a car,
that crash into a picture of
a train...

20:14.320 --> 20:16.560
This makes no sense at all!

20:16.560 --> 20:19.240
No, hang on a minute. You've
got that wrong, haven't you?

20:19.280 --> 20:22.400
You get into two cars
but only drive off in
three-quarters of one.

20:22.440 --> 20:25.440
And you go to the station,
because presumably
you're going somewhere,

20:25.480 --> 20:27.760
but whilst you're going
somewhere, somebody
takes it and puts it back.

20:27.800 --> 20:30.080
You get back to the station
you haven't got a bloody car!

20:30.160 --> 20:31.320
That doesn't work!

20:31.320 --> 20:33.320
No, what they're saying is,

20:33.400 --> 20:36.560
the future is going to be
very inconvenient.

20:36.560 --> 20:38.040
Yeah, it sounds that way.

20:38.080 --> 20:40.000
That's basically
what they're actually saying.

20:40.040 --> 20:43.080
I've got a blindingly good
idea, I'd like to run this
by you...

20:43.160 --> 20:45.040
-Sure.
-...in a committee fashion.

20:45.080 --> 20:48.240
What if...
we had a car of our own.

20:48.280 --> 20:51.400
You could buy it or lease it,
but it was, like, your car.

20:51.440 --> 20:53.440
And then...
No, it's crazy, I know.

20:53.480 --> 20:55.160
Then there'd be
a pretty good chance

20:55.200 --> 20:57.560
it would be wherever it was
when you last left it...

20:57.640 --> 21:00.280
-when you came back to it.
-So all these people -

21:00.320 --> 21:01.920
you've left cars in
the car park here, have you?

21:01.960 --> 21:04.800
-So they'd still be there...
-That's exactly it!

21:04.800 --> 21:07.240
They won't have
been collected up
by a random stranger.

21:07.280 --> 21:10.240
Imagine this - you go out
and your car's still there.
Brilliant.

21:10.280 --> 21:11.880
Let me run with that,
if I may.

21:11.920 --> 21:14.960
What if you could run
these cars on a kind of
magic juice?

21:15.000 --> 21:16.640
(LAUGHTER)

21:16.680 --> 21:18.320
Takes two or three minutes
to replenish them,

21:18.400 --> 21:20.000
you go hundreds of miles.

21:20.040 --> 21:22.320
-What magic juice?
-Well, you could
get it from underground.

21:22.320 --> 21:25.680
-What's it made of?
-Squashed prawns?

21:25.720 --> 21:27.320
(LAUGHTER)

21:27.320 --> 21:29.320
It's all sounding a bit
improbable, mate.

21:29.400 --> 21:31.400
Well, let's take on the
company from Aberdeen

21:31.440 --> 21:34.400
and see who gets it
more right.

21:34.440 --> 21:36.320
Can I talk about
Robert Kubica?

21:36.320 --> 21:39.240
Polish Formula One driver,
there's a picture of him now.

21:39.280 --> 21:41.200
A few years ago,
eight years ago actually,

21:41.240 --> 21:44.320
he had a terrible accident
while doing a spot of
rallying for fun.

21:44.400 --> 21:47.440
That was the car.
You see the crash barrier
went into the car.

21:47.480 --> 21:50.080
Broke every single bone on
the right side of his body,

21:50.160 --> 21:52.400
everything from his heel
to his shoulder.

21:52.440 --> 21:55.960
Had a seven-hour operation
to put his arm back on again,

21:56.000 --> 21:58.560
and then 17 more operations
after that.

21:58.600 --> 22:00.400
And his arm still
doesn't work properly,

22:00.440 --> 22:03.480
but this weekend he is back
in a Formula One car.

22:03.520 --> 22:05.520
And I'd just like say,
that's bloody brilliant.

22:05.560 --> 22:07.560
What a man!

22:07.600 --> 22:09.320
RICHARD: Determination.

22:09.360 --> 22:10.760
Like um...

22:13.240 --> 22:15.960
Mark Webber, OK,
the Aussie F1 guy,

22:16.000 --> 22:17.720
former F1 guy,

22:17.760 --> 22:19.920
he welcomed him back to
Formula One by tweeting:

22:19.960 --> 22:21.840
(IN AUSTRALIAN ACCENT)
"Poland's man is coming back,

22:21.880 --> 22:24.840
what a warrior
and tenacious prick he is."

22:24.880 --> 22:27.200
Now, to be fair, to be fair
for an Australian,

22:27.240 --> 22:29.200
that is getting quite
soppy and sentimental.

22:29.240 --> 22:31.560
"Ah, yeah, he's a prick."

22:31.600 --> 22:33.840
Oh, now.
As I'm sure you know,

22:33.880 --> 22:35.840
there's a lot of work
going on at the moment

22:35.880 --> 22:37.880
with sort of electric cars,
driverless cars

22:37.920 --> 22:40.120
-and the future of
transportation and so on.
-Yes, we have noticed.

22:40.160 --> 22:43.320
Exactly. All I want is
something that stops things

22:43.360 --> 22:45.840
falling down the side
of the seat when
you're driving along.

22:45.880 --> 22:47.680
I want the car I've got now,

22:47.720 --> 22:49.720
but just something that
stops that happening.

22:49.760 --> 22:51.920
-That's it?
-That is the sum total
of your ambition?

22:51.960 --> 22:53.520
Yes, it is--

22:53.560 --> 22:55.600
At this period of fundamental
change in the whole concept

22:55.640 --> 22:58.640
of car ownership, car usage,
car functionality...

22:58.680 --> 23:01.160
Mm-hm, that's all I want,
something that...

23:01.200 --> 23:03.600
Cos they say it's dangerous
to tweet when you're driving.

23:03.640 --> 23:05.080
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

23:05.120 --> 23:06.440
Driving along like that,

23:06.480 --> 23:08.240
and "Oh, no, I've dropped
my phone down there."

23:08.280 --> 23:10.320
You've got the seat lifted,
your head's squashed,

23:10.360 --> 23:12.360
you're desperately shoving
your hand down there,

23:12.400 --> 23:15.520
shoving it in, all the skin's
been peeled back at the side.

23:15.560 --> 23:17.000
"I'll get it, I'll get it."

23:17.040 --> 23:20.160
-"Like a...
Like a determined vet.
-Exactly!

23:20.200 --> 23:22.000
Exactly!

23:22.040 --> 23:24.440
-(LAUGHTER)
-Not exactly.

23:24.480 --> 23:26.720
-Sort of, like...
-"Come on, mole, give birth!"

23:26.760 --> 23:28.240
(GRUNTS) "It's burst!"

23:28.280 --> 23:30.520
Why can't we just
have a little bit of a f...

23:30.560 --> 23:33.880
I mean, I'm doing it on this
side because we're all
British, but whatever side.

23:33.920 --> 23:39.000
A little flap of material
that stops things going down.
I mean, how hard can that be?

23:39.040 --> 23:41.120
I know what you mean,
it is an issue.

23:41.160 --> 23:44.800
I once looked under
the driver seat of my 911,
and you'll remember this,

23:44.840 --> 23:47.400
I found eight pairs of
sunglasses I'd lost
and replaced.

23:47.440 --> 23:49.120
-He did.
-Just all under there.

23:49.160 --> 23:51.360
There's house keys,
ingots, relatives.

23:51.400 --> 23:54.080
There's also...
And eventually you
do drop something.

23:54.120 --> 23:55.680
You know what it's like
when you drop something
and you think,

23:55.720 --> 23:57.960
"I really do need to get that
back," so you have to stop.

23:58.000 --> 24:00.440
And then you can't get it
from here or from here.

24:00.480 --> 24:02.440
So then you have to go
round the back,

24:02.480 --> 24:04.040
and you can never
quite get in properly,

24:04.080 --> 24:05.800
so you've got your hand
under it like this.

24:05.840 --> 24:09.280
And there's always... There's
always what feels like

24:09.320 --> 24:11.720
a bit of furry mucus.

24:11.760 --> 24:13.760
No, there is! There is,
there is! You've seen it!

24:13.800 --> 24:15.800
-That is always there.
-Like a hairy tumour.

24:15.840 --> 24:17.200
And it's squidgy,
and you go...

24:17.240 --> 24:19.560
There always,
always is one of those,

24:19.600 --> 24:22.880
and it's always, always
on top of whatever it was
you lost.

24:22.920 --> 24:25.320
Do you know, the Holy Grail
will probably turn up

24:25.360 --> 24:27.360
-under somebody's
driving seat.
-It will.

24:27.400 --> 24:30.240
I tell you what, if you went
underneath everybody's seat,

24:30.280 --> 24:32.600
if you all tonight
when you go back to the car,

24:32.640 --> 24:34.280
have a look
under your car seats,

24:34.320 --> 24:37.760
you will find enough loose
change to pay for Brexit.

24:37.800 --> 24:39.440
(LAUGHTER)

24:39.480 --> 24:41.320
It could do it,
it could tip it.

24:41.360 --> 24:44.040
We could pretty much pay
the whole lot. Who's with me?

24:44.080 --> 24:46.760
AUDIENCE: Yes.

24:46.800 --> 24:48.800
There you go, you see,
people applauded...

24:48.840 --> 24:50.320
Well, three people
applauded my idea.

24:50.360 --> 24:51.920
(LAUGHTER)

24:51.960 --> 24:53.480
-James?
-What?

24:53.520 --> 24:55.600
-Interesting news.
RICHARD: Oh, God!

24:55.640 --> 24:57.360
What do you mean, "Oh, God"?

24:57.400 --> 25:00.320
Well, whenever one of you
two says, "Interesting news"

25:00.360 --> 25:02.160
it turns out to be
about the war.

25:02.200 --> 25:05.320
-No, this...
isn't about the war.
-(LAUGHTER)

25:05.360 --> 25:07.400
This is interesting news about
the speed of different birds.

25:07.440 --> 25:09.440
-Oh, that's even worse!
-Oh, I love this.

25:09.480 --> 25:11.480
We've talked
about this before?

25:11.520 --> 25:14.320
They've been going on about
this ever since he claimed

25:14.360 --> 25:16.560
to have clocked a pigeon
doing 25 miles an hour.

25:16.600 --> 25:19.960
I did. I was driving
alongside, there was
a pigeon that was doing 25.

25:20.000 --> 25:25.360
Anyway, a Swiss speed camera
has clocked a duck...

25:25.400 --> 25:27.440
It's clocked a duck,
it's actually triggered
the camera.

25:27.480 --> 25:29.480
Got a picture here,
look, proving it.

25:29.520 --> 25:32.400
JAMES: Look at that!
-And it took a picture
of a duck.

25:32.440 --> 25:34.760
JAMES: How fast was it going?
JEREMY: 32 miles an hour.

25:34.800 --> 25:37.120
JAMES: There you go.
That's quite incredible.

25:37.160 --> 25:40.720
Cos if I was asked, I'd say
a duck would do 20 or 21--

25:40.760 --> 25:44.440
It's not quite incredible,
neither is it remotely
interesting!

25:44.480 --> 25:46.680
It is interesting!
It's a piece of knowledge,
Hammond!

25:46.720 --> 25:50.520
How can the world be a poorer
place for having a bit more
knowledge in it?

25:50.560 --> 25:52.480
-Exactly.
-Because that knowledge

25:52.520 --> 25:57.280
is peculiar and strange,
and doesn't matter
a bugger to anybody.

25:57.320 --> 26:00.680
You're not gonna be
mocking when you're Buttons
in the panto in Swindon

26:00.720 --> 26:03.320
and Jeremy and I are
waving at each other
from our super yachts

26:03.360 --> 26:05.520
because of the global success
of our television series

26:05.560 --> 26:08.240
James And Jeremy's
The Speed Of Birds.

26:08.280 --> 26:11.280
-It's gonna be
absolutely massive.
-Who'd watch that?

26:11.320 --> 26:13.280
Come on, who'd watch
The Speed Of Birds?

26:13.320 --> 26:15.840
Who wants to see him
as Buttons at
the Swindon Wyvern?

26:15.880 --> 26:17.800
-Me.
-(CHEERING)

26:19.640 --> 26:22.600
No! Never!

26:22.640 --> 26:25.760
-I think that marks the end
of Conversation Street.
JEREMY: Yes.

26:25.800 --> 26:27.800
I think it does.
I think I'll move it on,

26:27.840 --> 26:32.640
because all of us agree that
we do love a hot hatchback.

26:32.680 --> 26:36.160
Yeah, we love that they're
practical, cheap to run,
cheap to repair,

26:36.200 --> 26:38.400
but they still go like
demented baboons.

26:38.440 --> 26:42.200
Yeah, and now there's
a new breed of small
hot hatchback.

26:42.240 --> 26:45.120
And to find which one is
best, we took The Grand Tour

26:45.160 --> 26:48.080
to that field
just over there.

26:51.840 --> 26:53.600
Yes, the start point
for our test

26:53.640 --> 26:56.200
was our own track
in Oxfordshire.

26:56.240 --> 26:58.960
And this is what
we'd assembled.

27:00.440 --> 27:03.720
I've brought
the new Volkswagen Polo GTI,

27:03.760 --> 27:06.960
which has 197 horsepower.

27:07.000 --> 27:11.000
Richard Hammond has brought
the new Ford Fiesta ST,

27:11.040 --> 27:15.040
which also has
197 horsepower.

27:15.080 --> 27:18.680
James May has brought
the new Toyota Yaris,

27:18.720 --> 27:21.040
which has a ridiculous name,

27:21.080 --> 27:23.000
the "Grmn".

27:24.200 --> 27:26.120
Grmm-nn...

27:26.160 --> 27:28.000
Grmn. How do you say that?
Grmm-nn...

27:28.040 --> 27:29.760
Grumuna.

27:29.800 --> 27:31.960
It isn't Grumuna,
there's no "a" at the end.

27:32.000 --> 27:33.960
It says "Grmn".

27:34.000 --> 27:36.400
-It is a funny name.
-What does it mean, Grmn?

27:36.440 --> 27:40.320
Gazoo Racing
Meisters of the Nurburgring.

27:40.360 --> 27:43.040
-Oh! Your favourite place!
-That's where it was
developed.

27:43.080 --> 27:45.040
JEREMY:
And what is Gazoo Racing?

27:45.080 --> 27:47.080
JAMES: Gazoo Racing is
Toyota's racing division.

27:47.120 --> 27:49.520
This has been done
by a small group of people

27:49.560 --> 27:51.320
dedicating themselves
over two years

27:51.360 --> 27:53.080
to making this
the perfect hot hatch.

27:53.120 --> 27:55.920
Stiffened body shell, shorter
springs, SACHS dampers.

27:55.960 --> 27:58.760
It's got a supercharger, it's
got special forged wheels,

27:58.800 --> 28:01.440
it's got special tyres, it's
got stiffened anti-roll bars.

28:01.480 --> 28:04.480
It's even got a different
steering rack from the
standard Yaris.

28:04.520 --> 28:06.560
That's proper
hot-hatch technology.

28:06.600 --> 28:10.280
My car is just over £21,000,
yours is what?

28:10.320 --> 28:12.640
RICHARD: Just shy of £20,000.
JEREMY: Just under £20,000.

28:12.680 --> 28:15.280
Over £26,000.

28:15.320 --> 28:16.960
And worth every penny,

28:17.000 --> 28:19.360
because it's properly
developed as a hot hatchback.

28:19.400 --> 28:21.400
RICHARD:
It's not a pretty car.

28:21.440 --> 28:23.920
JAMES: I think it is.
JEREMY: It's put make-up
on one eye.

28:23.960 --> 28:26.120
Slightly mad make-up
on one eye, it's like Kiss.

28:26.160 --> 28:28.480
It's like watching my
daughters get ready
in the morning.

28:28.520 --> 28:29.960
"Am I done?"
"Yeah, you're done."

28:30.000 --> 28:31.280
Yours is a brown car.

28:31.320 --> 28:33.080
-It's not brown!
-That is brown.

28:33.120 --> 28:35.520
-Oh, yeah, it is.
-It isn't, it's mushroom.

28:35.560 --> 28:37.200
The cameramen know
about colour. Is it brown?

28:37.240 --> 28:38.920
-It's brown.
CAMERAMAN:
It's definitely brown.

28:38.960 --> 28:41.440
It's mushroom!

28:41.480 --> 28:44.200
JEREMY: At this point,
we decided
that instead of arguing

28:44.240 --> 28:47.720
about which car was best, we
should do some actual tests,

28:47.760 --> 28:51.640
starting with a pursuit race.

28:51.680 --> 28:55.120
Each of us was spaced
at equal distances
around the track

28:55.160 --> 28:57.080
and the rules were simple.

28:57.120 --> 28:59.640
When you're overtaken
by the car behind...

29:00.800 --> 29:03.240
...James is out.

29:03.280 --> 29:06.000
Can I just ask, why am
I starting on the gravel,

29:06.040 --> 29:08.880
on a bend, when you two
are on Tarmac?

29:08.920 --> 29:10.920
-Have you got launch control?
-No.

29:10.960 --> 29:13.200
Well, that's your look-out,
then, isn't it? I have.

29:13.240 --> 29:16.080
-(CHUCKLES)
-All right, what-evs.
Let's go.

29:18.400 --> 29:20.320
Launch control active!
I'm ready.

29:21.400 --> 29:23.080
(ENGINE REVVING)

29:24.160 --> 29:27.120
RADIO: Three, two, one, go!

29:30.720 --> 29:33.280
Ooh, and we are away!

29:37.160 --> 29:38.160
Aw.

29:40.800 --> 29:41.920
It's a lively little thing,
this.

29:48.480 --> 29:50.600
Let's not forget, shall we,
that Volkswagen

29:50.640 --> 29:57.040
invented the hot hatchback
and they're still
the best at it.

29:57.080 --> 29:59.920
Take an ordinary hatchback,
stiffen the suspension,

29:59.960 --> 30:02.080
stiffen the body,
give it a big engine.

30:02.120 --> 30:03.120
The end.

30:05.280 --> 30:06.520
Kazoo!

30:06.560 --> 30:09.880
It's nice, it feels taut.
What happens here?

30:09.920 --> 30:11.640
Where does it go?

30:17.080 --> 30:18.800
(TYRES SCREECH)

30:18.840 --> 30:20.760
This is cracking.
I love these.

30:24.680 --> 30:26.680
Those little crackles and
bangs from the exhaust,

30:26.720 --> 30:28.280
it's got valves in it...

30:29.920 --> 30:31.800
...to make it sound good.

30:35.040 --> 30:38.080
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.
And into the gravel cell.

30:42.240 --> 30:45.200
It's actually quite funny the
way the tail will slide round

30:45.240 --> 30:47.400
and then you can feel
the brakes grabbing

30:47.440 --> 30:49.360
to stop it
actually spinning.

30:52.200 --> 30:55.200
That way,
you can have lots of fun

30:55.240 --> 30:58.560
without there being
blood or an ambulance.

31:02.040 --> 31:04.360
No, got it wrong, and
I've got Jezza behind me.

31:05.880 --> 31:08.400
The "Grunumunum"
is right in my sights now.

31:10.800 --> 31:13.440
Come on, come on, come on.
This is exciting times now.

31:13.480 --> 31:15.880
Duh! Incorrect.

31:19.600 --> 31:21.320
Ah, that was, I overdid it.

31:23.320 --> 31:25.960
Hard to see where
I'm going now due to
the dust cloud

31:26.000 --> 31:27.920
from the
"Grunumunummmnnmm".

31:31.640 --> 31:34.200
-Whoa!
-Oh, no, Hammond's
catching Clarkson as well.

31:34.240 --> 31:36.040
This is getting
very interesting.

31:37.880 --> 31:39.840
Right, time
to reel Jeremy in.

31:42.280 --> 31:44.200
Come on, come on,
come on, this is...

31:44.240 --> 31:45.600
Too wide.

31:46.920 --> 31:48.680
You're out! Ha ha!

31:48.720 --> 31:50.520
With the roadblock
out of the way,

31:50.560 --> 31:52.840
it became a two-horse
war of attrition.

31:55.080 --> 31:57.000
Come on, Clarkson,
you're mine.

31:58.440 --> 32:00.080
Grip. Grip, grip, grip.

32:01.920 --> 32:03.280
(CACKLES)

32:06.200 --> 32:08.880
Hot hatchbacks
are such a riot!

32:08.920 --> 32:10.840
They really are.

32:13.800 --> 32:16.120
If someone were to say to me
now, "Do you want to get out

32:16.160 --> 32:19.840
and swap into a 911 Turbo
or a 488?"

32:19.880 --> 32:22.920
I'd say, "No, I honestly
do not want to do that."

32:24.000 --> 32:25.120
(CACKLES)

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
Oh, bit of lift-off
oversteer.

32:30.040 --> 32:31.880
That's what you want
in a hot hatch.

32:33.560 --> 32:35.200
Several laps later,

32:35.240 --> 32:38.680
both of us were still
the same distance apart.

32:40.800 --> 32:45.640
It's just occurred to me
we both have the same
knowledge of this track,

32:45.680 --> 32:48.000
we both have
197 horsepower.

32:49.080 --> 32:52.440
This race may take a while.

32:52.480 --> 32:55.600
JEREMY: However...
-Brakes are fading, I can
feel them fading a bit.

32:55.640 --> 32:57.120
They do get hot.

32:57.160 --> 32:59.760
JEREMY: Mine meanwhile
had got smoky hot.

33:02.600 --> 33:06.400
So, much to the annoyance
of our colleague...

33:06.440 --> 33:09.400
...we decided
to call it a draw.

33:09.440 --> 33:12.640
Can I just say, if this was
a proper race rather than
a catchy-up race,

33:12.680 --> 33:16.080
I'd be in the lead because I
treated my car properly and
didn't overheat the brakes.

33:16.120 --> 33:17.720
-Have you heard this?
-I did hear that.

33:17.760 --> 33:19.040
You don't pause in a race!

33:19.080 --> 33:21.080
-So if you drive slowly,
you win?
-Yes.

33:21.120 --> 33:24.400
Because my brakes
aren't overheating,
I could still be--

33:24.440 --> 33:26.880
-You never went
more than 28mph!
-Rubbish!

33:26.920 --> 33:30.040
When did you watch a motor
race on the television,
on Grandstand or--

33:30.080 --> 33:35.520
Rather than listen to any
more of May's bizarre
theories on motor sport...

33:35.560 --> 33:38.160
...we decide to move on
to the next challenge.

33:40.400 --> 33:42.320
A drag race.

33:42.360 --> 33:45.800
Let me talk you
through the engine.
It's a two-litre turbo.

33:47.120 --> 33:48.600
What more do you want?

33:48.640 --> 33:51.840
Right, launch control.
I'm ready.

33:51.880 --> 33:53.480
I'm also ready.

33:53.520 --> 33:55.920
James, on the other hand,

33:55.960 --> 33:58.600
has some explaining to do
about his "Grunumm..."

34:00.600 --> 34:02.600
This engine's actually
pretty interesting.

34:02.640 --> 34:05.640
First and foremost, it's been
breathed upon by Lotus.

34:05.680 --> 34:08.080
They actually use a similar
spec engine in the Elise.

34:08.120 --> 34:10.640
But perhaps more
interestingly,
it's supercharged,

34:10.680 --> 34:12.680
which is unusual
in a hot hatchback.

34:12.720 --> 34:15.920
Why bother with a
supercharger? It's heavier
than a turbocharger...

34:21.360 --> 34:23.160
So the headline figures are:

34:23.200 --> 34:25.440
I have the most power,
209 horsepower.

34:25.480 --> 34:28.880
I have the lowest weight,
1,135 kilograms.

34:28.920 --> 34:33.600
And that's over 200 kilograms
lighter than Clarkson's VW.

34:33.640 --> 34:37.600
JEREMY: Eventually
James finished talking
and we were ready to go.

34:38.640 --> 34:40.120
I probably won't win this.

34:40.160 --> 34:42.280
My problem is
I've got the heaviest car

34:42.320 --> 34:44.040
and I'm the heaviest driver.

34:46.120 --> 34:47.160
(BLEEPING)

34:48.680 --> 34:50.160
(BLEEPING)

34:52.160 --> 34:54.080
And we are away.

34:56.440 --> 34:58.360
Where's that bloody Polo
going?

35:07.160 --> 35:08.640
Yes!

35:08.640 --> 35:10.360
Oh, what?

35:10.400 --> 35:12.920
A victory for the fat boy!

35:14.960 --> 35:19.080
That can only mean that VW
have got their figures wrong.

35:19.120 --> 35:21.920
Again.

35:21.960 --> 35:25.040
JEREMY: This surprising
result called for a bit
of a debrief.

35:27.000 --> 35:29.000
The mushroom-coloured Polo--

35:29.040 --> 35:31.520
-Brown!
-The brown VW has won.

35:31.560 --> 35:33.560
Actually,
I've got to be honest.

35:33.600 --> 35:37.160
I am quite surprised by
its astonishing victory.

35:37.200 --> 35:39.400
It is really annoying. And
there's nothing you can do.

35:39.440 --> 35:42.560
-Cos it's heavy.
-And it's only as powerful
as this.

35:42.600 --> 35:44.600
The DSG gearbox
makes a huge difference.

35:44.640 --> 35:46.160
Yeah, the double clutch.

35:46.200 --> 35:49.200
Every time you two
have to change gear,
you lose 20 yards.

35:49.280 --> 35:51.960
There's no way you can keep
up with an old-fashioned box.

35:52.000 --> 35:54.360
-No, it's one gear,
then another--
-(MESSAGE ALERT)

35:54.400 --> 35:55.960
Oh, hang on.

35:56.000 --> 35:58.000
Text from Mr Wilman.

35:58.040 --> 36:01.480
-"You idiots."
-Nice.
-Not very kind.

36:01.520 --> 36:05.640
"Stop banging on about
double-clutch gearboxes
and lift-off oversteer.

36:05.640 --> 36:08.360
These cars are supposed
to appeal to young people

36:08.400 --> 36:10.480
and they have no idea
what those things are.

36:13.680 --> 36:17.480
The winner of this test will
be the car that appeals most
to millennials,

36:17.520 --> 36:20.600
not old men like you."

36:20.640 --> 36:24.560
So what test do we do
that young people
would be interested?

36:24.600 --> 36:26.920
No, wait, I've had an idea.

36:26.960 --> 36:28.360
JAMES:
What exactly is a millennial?

36:34.040 --> 36:36.920
JEREMY: Once we'd explained
this to James,
we left the test track,

36:36.960 --> 36:41.840
and began our new
youth-friendly road test.

36:41.880 --> 36:47.400
What I've done is I've fitted
some youth-friendly political
stickers on the doors.

36:47.440 --> 36:54.880
And then on the windscreen,
a transgender, fluid,
neutral sunscreen.

36:54.920 --> 36:57.320
The other Jeremy, of course,
is the great Jeremy Corbyn,

36:57.360 --> 36:59.760
leader of the Labour Party,

36:59.800 --> 37:04.320
a man with the same initials
as the Baby Jesus,

37:04.360 --> 37:06.080
one of the prophets of Islam.

37:08.040 --> 37:10.200
Richard, meanwhile,
had for some reason

37:10.280 --> 37:13.640
put the shipping forecast
on the doors of the Fiesta.

37:17.160 --> 37:19.640
Why have you got "Stormy"
on the side of your car?

37:19.640 --> 37:22.840
Cos that's the name of
the rapper that
young people adore.

37:22.880 --> 37:24.400
No, that's Stormzy.

37:24.440 --> 37:29.000
Stormy's that sexual
intercourse enthusiast
in America.

37:29.040 --> 37:30.960
Popular with young people?

37:34.520 --> 37:37.360
JAMES: Meanwhile, I'd headed
for an organic farm shop

37:37.400 --> 37:40.640
to test out
my young-people modification.

37:40.640 --> 37:43.800
What I've fitted to my car -
it's powered by the same
USB port

37:43.840 --> 37:46.480
that you'd normally use to
recharge your vape bong -

37:46.520 --> 37:49.960
is the most important thing
in a millennial's life.

37:50.000 --> 37:53.000
And that is, of course,
a juicer. Ta-da!

37:53.040 --> 37:58.360
Now, using this, I can make
a whole range of tasty
and nutritious juices

37:58.400 --> 38:01.560
using a variety of
ethically-sound ingredients.

38:01.600 --> 38:03.840
And that means
I won't be beholden

38:03.880 --> 38:07.360
to evil American corporations
that murder baby veals

38:07.400 --> 38:09.880
and snap the beaks
off chickens.

38:12.640 --> 38:15.960
RICHARD: Back on the road,
Jeremy and I were busy
competing

38:16.000 --> 38:19.640
to win the hearts and minds
of the snowflakes.

38:19.640 --> 38:22.960
Because you're young,
you'll care very much
about the environment.

38:23.000 --> 38:27.000
So you'll be very glad to
know that unlike the Polo
and the Toyota,

38:27.040 --> 38:30.360
this doesn't have
four cylinders -
the Fiesta only has three.

38:30.400 --> 38:32.200
In fact, when it's cruising,

38:32.280 --> 38:35.160
it can deactivate one of them
and go down to two.

38:35.200 --> 38:37.200
That's a world first
on a three-cylinder car.

38:37.280 --> 38:40.960
And what it means is,
it's nicer to polar bears.

38:43.960 --> 38:46.440
The seats in here
are made from cloth,

38:46.480 --> 38:50.080
so no cow was harmed in
the making of the interior.

38:50.120 --> 38:54.120
Apart from a small veal
who was used to make
the steering wheel.

38:54.160 --> 38:55.840
But that's it.

38:58.320 --> 38:59.880
(WHIRRING)

39:01.200 --> 39:04.440
Right, this one is kale,
apple,

39:04.480 --> 39:08.200
line-caught avocado
and ethical water...

39:08.280 --> 39:10.920
plus my reading glasses
which fell in there
earlier on.

39:10.960 --> 39:13.760
But it doesn't matter,
they've got plastic lenses
so they're perfectly safe.

39:17.160 --> 39:18.400
Mm!

39:18.440 --> 39:20.360
Someone's gonna want that.

39:23.120 --> 39:26.040
JEREMY: In order to see if
we were on the right track,

39:26.080 --> 39:28.640
Richard and I had headed
into the wonderful,

39:28.640 --> 39:30.640
anti-car city of Oxford.

39:32.640 --> 39:34.600
Many, many cyclists here.

39:38.040 --> 39:41.160
Look at the way young people
are approving of my car

39:41.200 --> 39:42.920
and my stickers.

39:44.080 --> 39:45.960
Dab on it, wagwam!

39:46.000 --> 39:48.880
I speak the language
of the millennial.

39:48.920 --> 39:52.760
Hammond and May won't be
able to do that, cos they're
in a Ford and a Toyota.

39:52.800 --> 39:54.160
They're bad whips.

39:55.560 --> 39:57.400
You'll see
there's a bus lane here.

39:57.440 --> 40:01.640
And the Fiesta
is showing no sign at all

40:01.640 --> 40:05.960
of complaining that half
the road is completely empty
and unused.

40:07.560 --> 40:10.120
This car has no problem
with that.

40:10.160 --> 40:13.600
JEREMY: There's a couple of
hikers, Hammond, on my left.

40:13.640 --> 40:16.880
I'm not judging them,
cos judging people is wrong.

40:16.920 --> 40:18.840
Oh, cyclist.

40:22.040 --> 40:25.040
-(MOTORCYCLE ENGINE REVS)
-Maniac!

40:25.080 --> 40:29.600
Having drunk his spectacles,
James was now on the move.

40:29.640 --> 40:32.040
My latest juice has
a bit of an Asian flavour.

40:32.080 --> 40:36.680
Because it's made with okra,
some ground-up dry ginger,

40:36.760 --> 40:40.080
a touch of garlic,
a pinch of garam masala...

40:40.120 --> 40:43.640
and a pork pie.

40:43.640 --> 40:46.400
This car was, of course,
developed at the Nurburgring,

40:46.440 --> 40:48.440
which might sound
not very millennial.

40:48.480 --> 40:52.440
But on the other hand, it is
the world's greenest circuit.

40:52.480 --> 40:54.080
It is completely...

40:54.120 --> 40:56.120
-(SPLASHING)
-Oh, Jesus!

40:56.160 --> 40:58.080
(BRAKES SQUEALING)

41:00.440 --> 41:01.960
God! Agh!

41:03.040 --> 41:04.880
Agh...

41:04.920 --> 41:06.200
Agh.

41:07.680 --> 41:09.160
(SPITS)

41:09.160 --> 41:11.160
Back to the tent.

41:11.200 --> 41:13.600
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

41:13.640 --> 41:16.360
JEREMY:
I've gotta be honest...

41:16.400 --> 41:20.440
Apart from you drinking
plastic, which is evil,

41:20.480 --> 41:23.840
I thought that was all going
rather well, the test
appealing to young people.

41:23.880 --> 41:28.000
Yeah, we talked about carbon
dioxide and polar bears

41:28.040 --> 41:30.040
and expressed our support
for the Labour Party.

41:30.080 --> 41:33.680
Yeah, apart from the bit
where the juicer blew up
in my face, obviously,

41:33.760 --> 41:35.400
it was all going rather
excellently, we thought.

41:35.440 --> 41:37.120
It was, yeah.

41:37.160 --> 41:40.440
Unfortunately, Mr Wilman
said we hadn't got
the idea at all.

41:40.480 --> 41:43.160
-No.
-And that to really appeal
to millennials,

41:43.160 --> 41:46.840
we had to somehow get
our cars in The Mail Online.

41:46.880 --> 41:49.080
Now this was a bit of
a problem for James,

41:49.120 --> 41:52.160
-who claims he's never read
The Mail Online.
-I haven't.

41:52.200 --> 41:54.880
You're not really The Mail's
target audience, James.

41:54.920 --> 41:56.760
What do you mean by that?

41:56.800 --> 42:00.920
You're not a mealy-mouthed
bitter person...

42:00.960 --> 42:04.200
...who believes
that everyone who is
luckier, better-looking,

42:04.280 --> 42:07.680
richer and more talented
than you are should be torn
to shreds and executed.

42:07.760 --> 42:09.160
(LAUGHTER)

42:09.160 --> 42:12.440
Right, well, whatever,
the rules were simple.

42:12.480 --> 42:16.840
We had to drive into London
and then do something
with our cars

42:16.880 --> 42:19.800
that would get the paparazzi
to take a picture of them.

42:19.840 --> 42:23.640
And then the winner would be
the person who got the most
amount of those pictures

42:23.680 --> 42:25.600
actually published.

42:29.000 --> 42:32.040
RICHARD: I decided that
what I'd do was take my wife

42:32.080 --> 42:35.280
out for dinner at
the glittering
Bluebird restaurant

42:35.320 --> 42:38.000
on the famous King's Road.

42:38.040 --> 42:40.160
It's a popular haunt
for the paps, this.

42:40.200 --> 42:44.760
And I felt sure we'd
be snapped getting out
of the little Ford.

42:44.800 --> 42:47.600
OK, right,
so remember to smile.

42:47.640 --> 42:49.640
And look like
you really like me.

42:49.640 --> 42:51.440
-OK.
-Like, a lot.

42:53.320 --> 42:55.000
Right.

42:55.040 --> 42:57.040
Hold my hand, there.

42:57.080 --> 42:59.160
And then we'll just
stand around for a bit.

43:02.960 --> 43:05.520
-Looking forward to dinner
with my wife Mindy.
-That'll be nice.

43:09.920 --> 43:13.520
Jeremy, meanwhile, had
decided that to get
himself noticed,

43:13.560 --> 43:17.320
he'd have a puncture,
and then get a celebrity

43:17.360 --> 43:19.920
like Binky Felstead
to help him mend it.

43:22.480 --> 43:25.200
-You grab the spare wheel.
-Really?

43:30.120 --> 43:32.280
You have to twiddle it
so the car goes up.

43:32.320 --> 43:34.200
-Really high in the sky.
-For God's sake!

43:34.280 --> 43:35.680
Oh.

43:35.760 --> 43:37.760
Come on,
put your back into it.

43:37.800 --> 43:41.280
I'm exhausted. (GRUNTS)

43:41.320 --> 43:43.160
JEREMY: James, meanwhile,
was driving a car

43:43.200 --> 43:45.160
that's never been papped

43:45.200 --> 43:47.640
through a part of London
that's never been papped,

43:47.680 --> 43:51.000
with his dinner date,
historian Mary Beard...

43:51.040 --> 43:53.240
who hasn't been
papped either.

43:55.640 --> 43:57.560
I'm absolutely delighted.

43:57.600 --> 43:59.600
This has made my month, this.

43:59.640 --> 44:03.320
Well... Well, thank you,
that's very generous.

44:03.360 --> 44:06.600
James then tried to think of
some interesting small talk.

44:14.560 --> 44:17.080
This has this handy piece of
red in the steering wheel,

44:17.120 --> 44:20.000
so you know when you're going
in a straight line, you see.

44:20.040 --> 44:22.880
(TUTS) They've thought
of everything.

44:24.320 --> 44:26.120
JEREMY:
Meanwhile, back in Chelsea...

44:27.520 --> 44:29.520
There's no paps.
There's nobody here.

44:29.560 --> 44:31.480
-No.
-There's no photographers.

44:34.280 --> 44:35.880
It's ridiculous.

44:35.920 --> 44:37.920
I'm always being
photographed here.

44:37.960 --> 44:39.280
Look, here I am.

44:39.320 --> 44:41.320
And here I am.

44:41.360 --> 44:43.120
And here... Oh, she's just...

44:43.160 --> 44:45.080
She's just a friend
from work.

44:46.880 --> 44:48.640
We should try
having an argument.

44:48.680 --> 44:51.800
-I don't want to have
an argument.
-Well, I do, and you don't.

44:51.840 --> 44:54.000
So we're already having
an argument. This is good.

44:54.040 --> 44:56.600
-I don't want an argument.
-Just look a bit animated.

44:57.800 --> 44:59.520
JEREMY:
Having parked his car,

44:59.560 --> 45:02.280
James was now in his
favourite Indian restaurant,

45:02.320 --> 45:06.040
having a lesson
in classical history.

45:06.080 --> 45:10.040
The idea of the bloke
is that he is penetrating.

45:10.080 --> 45:15.160
To be a man
is to be the penetrator.

45:15.200 --> 45:18.920
Every orifice he likes,
sex wherever.

45:18.960 --> 45:21.000
I've got to say, this is not
what I was expecting.

45:21.040 --> 45:24.160
I was thinking you'd give me
some information about
the shape of arches.

45:24.200 --> 45:26.120
Oh, well,
we can go on to that.

45:26.160 --> 45:27.640
(SHE GRUNTS)

45:29.200 --> 45:31.200
So you've got to
get that lined up.

45:31.240 --> 45:33.160
And then put the new ones in.

45:35.000 --> 45:37.000
What are you doing?
You're not--

45:37.040 --> 45:39.240
-I'm sorry,
it's really greasy.
-I know!

45:39.280 --> 45:43.520
This may have been just
a puncture but it was
proving to be big news.

45:43.560 --> 45:45.080
(CAMERA SHUTTERS CLICKING)

45:47.360 --> 45:49.880
And that is how
you change a wheel.

45:49.920 --> 45:51.840
If you ever have
a puncture on a motorway,

45:51.880 --> 45:54.040
you're going to be
so grateful for this moment.

45:54.080 --> 45:55.280
Lesson learned, Jeremy.

45:56.360 --> 45:57.680
With dinner over,

45:57.720 --> 45:59.960
the two most unpappable
people in history

46:00.000 --> 46:02.800
were waiting to be papped.

46:02.840 --> 46:04.800
If we just stand here
looking a bit sort of...

46:04.840 --> 46:06.840
-Embarrassed?
-Well...

46:06.880 --> 46:08.360
Expectant?

46:08.400 --> 46:09.920
Somebody will come
and take a picture of us.

46:23.000 --> 46:26.200
I've just had a thought.
I don't want you to take this
the wrong way,

46:26.240 --> 46:29.480
but actually the idea of
this was to get the car
in the paper.

46:29.520 --> 46:31.440
I should have
parked it outside.

46:34.440 --> 46:36.360
(BELCHES)
Excuse me.

46:45.520 --> 46:47.720
Wait a minute, there is...
There's one.

46:47.760 --> 46:50.320
Don't point, don't look,
but there's one over there.
There he is.

46:50.360 --> 46:52.360
Pap, there.

46:52.400 --> 46:54.960
JEREMY: However, before
any pictures were taken,

46:55.000 --> 46:58.680
May and I hatched a plan we'd
been working on for years.

46:58.720 --> 47:00.240
Go.

47:09.360 --> 47:11.480
Oh, you bastards!

47:13.080 --> 47:14.960
That was my...

47:15.000 --> 47:16.720
Get in.

47:16.760 --> 47:18.680
(APPLAUSE)

47:24.080 --> 47:26.000
James, did...

47:26.040 --> 47:28.640
Did you burp in front
of Mary Beard?

47:28.680 --> 47:31.080
I did. I'm sorry, it just
fell out. I apologise.

47:31.120 --> 47:34.000
I know a lot of people
will be thinking
we engineered that.

47:34.040 --> 47:35.760
We really genuinely didn't.

47:35.800 --> 47:38.640
All you have to do to get
papped when you're in
our line of work

47:38.680 --> 47:41.520
is go into London,
do something mildly
out of the ordinary

47:41.560 --> 47:43.560
and then they swarm...
not round you.

47:43.600 --> 47:46.800
Or get clattered
and fall out of a club
with no trousers on.

47:46.840 --> 47:49.120
-That's a good way
of doing it.
-Or catch pneumonia.

47:49.160 --> 47:50.760
Yes.

47:50.800 --> 47:53.880
I've had that a few times.
Anyway, while we were waiting

47:53.920 --> 47:57.520
to see which of our antics
got into The Mail Online,

47:57.560 --> 48:01.880
Mr Wilman came up with
another youth-friendly idea.

48:01.920 --> 48:05.280
Yep, he said each of us had
to take a picture of our car

48:05.320 --> 48:09.280
and then see which of us got
the most likes of their snap
on Instagram.

48:12.160 --> 48:13.840
JAMES: Having split up,

48:13.880 --> 48:15.800
we set to work
on our respective plans.

48:17.040 --> 48:19.080
£50 is very reasonable, yeah.

48:20.480 --> 48:22.480
£50,000?

48:22.520 --> 48:24.520
Oh, right.

48:24.560 --> 48:26.560
Um...
I'll ring you back in a bit.

48:26.600 --> 48:28.520
Yeah, cheers.

48:32.880 --> 48:37.120
My idea was to put me and the
car in one of the pods of the
famous London Eye

48:37.160 --> 48:39.760
so we could have a picture
right at the top
with a fantastic view.

48:39.800 --> 48:43.840
They want £50,000!
I thought he meant 50 quid.

48:43.880 --> 48:46.480
Let's think of
something else.

48:46.520 --> 48:49.480
RICHARD:
I had done just that.

48:49.520 --> 48:51.640
For my Instagram picture,
I'm not messing about.

48:51.680 --> 48:55.560
I've recruited a top
photographer and I'm very
excited, cos he's brilliant.

48:55.600 --> 48:57.520
Look at that.

49:00.000 --> 49:02.760
His name is David Yarrow.

49:02.800 --> 49:05.720
He's one of the world's
greatest wildlife
photographers.

49:05.760 --> 49:09.200
And his plan was
to recreate this shot,

49:09.240 --> 49:12.280
using my car
instead of the tiger.

49:13.640 --> 49:15.200
So I'm coming in...

49:15.240 --> 49:17.240
The most important thing
is to have energy.

49:17.280 --> 49:19.280
It's got to be dynamic.

49:19.320 --> 49:23.360
And that means we need
water flying up between me
and the car.

49:23.400 --> 49:27.040
I want to be as close
safety-wise as you'll
allow me to be.

49:28.840 --> 49:31.200
Yeah, yeah.
I've got your number.

49:31.240 --> 49:32.880
-OK.
-(LAUGHS)

49:34.480 --> 49:35.840
JAMES: Back in London,

49:35.880 --> 49:37.880
I'd come up with
a brilliant idea.

49:42.200 --> 49:43.360
Morning.

49:57.320 --> 49:58.480
Morning.

50:02.360 --> 50:04.680
Hiya.
Put some clothes on.

50:06.440 --> 50:09.280
RICHARD: Eventually,
my shot was in the can.

50:11.600 --> 50:12.720
Ach!

50:14.360 --> 50:16.120
As was May's.

50:18.120 --> 50:20.120
And so, after
no work at all,

50:20.160 --> 50:22.080
was Jeremy's.

50:32.280 --> 50:36.960
Could... Could you have made
any less effort with that
challenge?

50:37.000 --> 50:38.880
No, you're right.

50:38.920 --> 50:41.720
I should have put a puppy
in it, cos Instagram
loves a dog.

50:41.760 --> 50:44.920
Anyone on Instagram,
it's all just dogs,
basically.

50:44.960 --> 50:46.960
Anyway, with our pictures
posted on Instagram,

50:47.000 --> 50:49.000
we were all given
another challenge,

50:49.040 --> 50:52.960
to see who could get
the most views of their car
on YouTube.

50:53.000 --> 50:55.240
Yeah, now,
this is a tricky one.

50:55.280 --> 51:01.080
Because over 300 hours of
footage are uploaded to
YouTube every minute.

51:01.120 --> 51:03.160
You wouldn't think
that many cats

51:03.200 --> 51:05.240
fell into
waste disposal units.

51:05.280 --> 51:07.000
No, I know, you wouldn't.

51:07.040 --> 51:09.040
Seems they do. So we had to
think of something special.

51:09.080 --> 51:13.040
How could we make our cars
shine in this crowded
firmament?

51:13.080 --> 51:14.720
Push them into
a waste disposal unit?

51:14.760 --> 51:16.280
I think that's got to be it.

51:16.320 --> 51:19.080
Or what I did
to get my Ford noticed,

51:19.120 --> 51:21.600
I decided to stage
a big stunt.

51:23.800 --> 51:25.760
In order to make
my first stunt video,

51:25.800 --> 51:29.760
I went to a very long runway.

51:29.800 --> 51:32.920
And once my star performer
had warmed up...

51:34.520 --> 51:36.240
...we were ready to roll.

51:39.960 --> 51:41.840
Today history is being made.

51:44.800 --> 51:46.120
Good luck.

51:55.680 --> 51:56.920
Oh.

51:56.960 --> 51:58.240
I can't watch.

52:08.560 --> 52:10.720
Yes! (LAUGHS)

52:10.760 --> 52:15.320
We are gonna break
the internet with that!

52:15.360 --> 52:19.680
Meanwhile, James had gone for
a rather different approach.

52:19.720 --> 52:22.360
If you go on YouTube,
which I do quite a lot,

52:22.400 --> 52:25.040
you will notice that
something that's very popular
with so-called millennials

52:25.080 --> 52:27.080
is the unboxing video.

52:27.120 --> 52:30.880
It's usually something
like an idle student
with nothing better to do

52:30.920 --> 52:33.200
simply taking something
they've bought out of the box

52:33.240 --> 52:34.880
and talking about it.

52:34.920 --> 52:37.880
Hey, what's going on?
The delivery guy's just left.

52:37.920 --> 52:41.000
Got it here and I haven't
even taken it out
of the box yet. I got--

52:41.040 --> 52:44.960
This bloke is unboxing a new
television set he's bought.

52:45.000 --> 52:47.000
You guys ready?

52:47.040 --> 52:48.960

52:50.960 --> 52:52.760
Look how many hits it's got.

52:52.800 --> 52:55.280

is not mounted on it,

52:55.320 --> 52:56.880
you have to put
that on later.

53:01.880 --> 53:03.600
Hi, guys, it's May!

53:03.640 --> 53:06.560
Welcome, brothers and sisters
to my latest unboxing video.

53:06.600 --> 53:09.000
And this is a big one.
It's a car.

Look how clean that is.

53:23.960 --> 53:25.560

Jeremy had decided

53:25.600 --> 53:28.000
to create a Fast Show -style

You two put the
"pap in a bag", didn't you?

57:04.640 --> 57:07.280
We did, but actually we
should sell those bags
to celebrities.

We should, cos they're
rather clever.

and not only can't you
take any pictures,

been another pap
we didn't spot,

it had to have the car in it.

in that picture.

some evidence to suggest
that is The Sun.

you wouldn't spot that.
-We did.

57:45.480 --> 57:46.800
I didn't do very well.

57:46.840 --> 57:49.640

a zero, Hammond.

So you get a zero.

for a curry in Hammersmith

57:58.920 --> 58:01.080
-Not that well, actually.
RICHARD: How not that well?

58:01.120 --> 58:04.520
-Nought, not that well.
-Not a single thing?

58:04.560 --> 58:06.640
-My plan was rather
successful.
-Was it?

58:06.680 --> 58:11.640
49 pictures appeared,
of my car and me and Binky
in The Mail Online.

58:11.680 --> 58:13.680
-49?
-49 pictures.

58:13.720 --> 58:17.120
Hang on a minute. 49 pictures
of a fat old bloke

58:17.160 --> 58:19.560
and a young girl I've never
heard of changing a wheel?

58:19.600 --> 58:21.600
I know. And the
extraordinary thing is,

58:21.640 --> 58:23.640
I'd like to show you
the 49 pictures

58:23.680 --> 58:27.080
but I got in touch with The
Mail Online yesterday, OK,

58:27.120 --> 58:28.720
to say, "Can we have
the pictures?"

58:28.760 --> 58:31.280
Do you want to know how much
they were gonna charge?

58:31.320 --> 58:34.160
£122,000.

58:34.200 --> 58:35.760
-What?
-Really?

58:35.800 --> 58:38.920
I kid you not. They take a
picture of me, ruin my life,

58:38.960 --> 58:42.000
and then for me
to buy the picture back

58:42.040 --> 58:45.600
is £122,000!

58:45.640 --> 58:48.000
There are 49 pictures
on here of you.

58:48.040 --> 58:51.440
Don't show the cameras,
otherwise there'll be a bill
for 120 grand.

58:51.480 --> 58:54.480
-But the good thing is...
-Exactly. Because of that,
you score 49.

58:54.520 --> 58:56.600
Yes, I'm afraid he does.
There's no getting around
that.

58:56.640 --> 58:59.600
Yes, I do. Which moves us
on to Instagram.

58:59.640 --> 59:02.520
James May, how did you do
with your picture on the bus?

59:02.560 --> 59:03.960
I scored nought.

59:04.000 --> 59:05.720
-Nought?
-Yeah.

59:05.760 --> 59:08.040
-How did you get nought?
-Well, it's quite
interesting.

59:08.080 --> 59:11.040
I didn't have an Instagram
account so I set one up.

59:11.080 --> 59:13.400
-There's a surprise.
-No, but I set one up.

59:13.440 --> 59:15.120
And then as I was
setting it up,
I realised

59:15.160 --> 59:18.080
there was someone else on
Instagram pretending to be me.

59:18.120 --> 59:21.720
So I filled in that reporting
thing that pulls down
and I sent it off.

59:21.760 --> 59:25.480
All credit to Instagram, they
reacted very quickly - by
that afternoon, in fact.

59:25.520 --> 59:27.120
And they shut me down.

59:27.160 --> 59:28.640
-(LAUGHTER)
-You?

59:28.680 --> 59:30.840
Yeah, they didn't shut down
the fake James May.

59:30.880 --> 59:32.560
They shut the real one down.

59:32.600 --> 59:34.600
-They killed the wrong
James May?
-Yeah.

59:34.640 --> 59:36.520
That's quite interesting.
What's interesting me,
though,

59:36.560 --> 59:39.480
is that there's a man
somewhere out in the world,
or woman,

59:39.520 --> 59:42.440
who's thought, "I could
pretend to be anyone I like.

59:42.480 --> 59:44.480
I shall pretend to be
James May."

59:44.520 --> 59:46.200
-I know.
RICHARD: Not very ambitious!

59:46.240 --> 59:48.040
Why wouldn't you be
George Clooney?

59:48.080 --> 59:50.520
Anyway, the net result
of that, as they say
in the army,

59:50.560 --> 59:52.600
is that I have...nought.

59:52.640 --> 59:55.560
-You're doing very well!
-I've got one, yeah.

59:55.600 --> 59:57.960
So, Hammond,
how did you get on?

59:58.000 --> 1:00:01.160
Well, my picture
was brilliant. Look at it.

1:00:01.200 --> 1:00:03.200
Look at that!

1:00:03.240 --> 1:00:06.240
JEREMY: No, apart from
the slogan with the sexual
intercourse enthusiast,

1:00:06.280 --> 1:00:08.280
that is an amazing
photograph, granted.

1:00:08.320 --> 1:00:12.240
So how many people have
viewed it and liked it
on Instagram?

1:00:13.320 --> 1:00:14.600
Nine.

1:00:14.640 --> 1:00:15.920
(LAUGHTER)

1:00:15.960 --> 1:00:17.960
-They blocked you as well?
-Nine. No.

1:00:18.000 --> 1:00:21.040
I don't really do Instagram,
so I don't have many
followers.

1:00:21.080 --> 1:00:23.080
So only nine people
have seen it.

1:00:23.120 --> 1:00:25.680
Oh, dear, cos I got 54,000.

1:00:25.720 --> 1:00:27.680
Oh, for God's sake!

1:00:27.720 --> 1:00:29.640
Yes, but you do do Instagram!

1:00:29.680 --> 1:00:31.560
-Yes, I do.
-So you got lots of
followers.

1:00:31.600 --> 1:00:33.200
Put in 54,000.

1:00:33.240 --> 1:00:35.320
Let's look at this in a more
positive light, Hammond.

1:00:35.360 --> 1:00:39.240
-He has got 1.6 million
Instagram followers.
-Yes.

1:00:39.280 --> 1:00:42.880
So 1.46 million people
actively didn't like his
picture.

1:00:42.920 --> 1:00:44.560
-That's another way
of looking at it.
-Loser!

1:00:44.600 --> 1:00:47.320
It wasn't my best work, I
admit. It was a hurried shot.

1:00:47.360 --> 1:00:49.080
-What was it?
-54,000.

1:00:49.120 --> 1:00:51.840
RICHARD: That does
change the score line a bit.

1:00:51.880 --> 1:00:55.520
It changes the score line a
lot, cos I'm now on 54,053.

1:00:55.560 --> 1:00:58.560
-Right, OK.
-And you're on one.

1:00:58.600 --> 1:01:01.400
Anyway, I also...
It gets worse, I'm afraid,
for you two.

1:01:01.440 --> 1:01:04.640
Because YouTube.
I didn't add them all up,

1:01:04.680 --> 1:01:08.120
but my first David Soufflé
video on YouTube...

1:01:08.160 --> 1:01:13.000
-266,000 views.
RICHARD: Oh, God.

1:01:13.040 --> 1:01:15.480
More than a quarter
of a million people.

1:01:21.960 --> 1:01:23.520
You are ahead now.

1:01:23.560 --> 1:01:27.480
Yes, I'm...comfortably
in the lead, I would say.

1:01:27.520 --> 1:01:29.520
So, come on, Hammond?

1:01:29.560 --> 1:01:31.560
16,800.

1:01:31.600 --> 1:01:33.200
What, for all that effort?

1:01:33.240 --> 1:01:35.240
I know!
I don't get it either.

1:01:35.280 --> 1:01:37.440
Because I gave it a really
cool, tempting caption.

1:01:37.480 --> 1:01:38.760
It said...

1:01:38.800 --> 1:01:40.720
(HE READS)

1:01:45.360 --> 1:01:47.160
Who doesn't want
to look at that?

1:01:47.200 --> 1:01:48.560
You actually put that
as the caption?

1:01:48.600 --> 1:01:49.840
That's what it said,
it's clickbait.

1:01:49.880 --> 1:01:51.560
Then the YouTube
millennials thought,

1:01:51.600 --> 1:01:53.120
"No, I'd rather watch
a cat going..."?

1:01:53.160 --> 1:01:54.400
-They must have done.
-That's ridiculous.

1:01:54.440 --> 1:01:55.960
I'm sorry, that is pathetic.

1:01:56.000 --> 1:01:58.600
Young people,
you're pathetic.

1:01:58.640 --> 1:02:00.800
Right, so, there we are,
those are the scores.

1:02:00.840 --> 1:02:02.680
-You're out.
-Yes.

1:02:02.720 --> 1:02:04.720
And, James,
I'm looking and I'm thinking,

1:02:04.760 --> 1:02:06.760
just doing quick adding up...

1:02:06.800 --> 1:02:09.360
Unless you manage to find

1:02:09.400 --> 1:02:12.200
325,000 people

1:02:12.240 --> 1:02:15.080
who are prepared
to spend 16 minutes...

1:02:15.120 --> 1:02:17.600
Cos that's how long
that unboxing video was.

1:02:17.640 --> 1:02:21.880
...16 minutes watching you
taking a small
Toyota hatchback

1:02:21.920 --> 1:02:24.440
out of a cardboard box,
I've won.

1:02:24.480 --> 1:02:25.560
-Yes.
-So?

1:02:26.640 --> 1:02:28.560
(SIGHS) 330...

1:02:31.160 --> 1:02:33.080
...thousand!

1:02:33.120 --> 1:02:35.240
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

1:02:36.800 --> 1:02:38.320
(WHOOPING)

1:02:42.280 --> 1:02:44.280
For taking a car
out of a box?

1:02:44.320 --> 1:02:46.320
Oh, he's doing the dance.

1:02:46.360 --> 1:02:49.080
How does he always
manage to win?

1:02:49.120 --> 1:02:51.760
I think on this occasion
it was partly because

1:02:51.800 --> 1:02:55.680
you tried to appeal to
millennials by creating a
Fast Show type character

1:02:55.720 --> 1:02:58.480
when nobody under 40 has ever
heard of The Fast Show.

1:02:58.520 --> 1:03:02.040
Right. You might as well have
done the comedy adventures of
Neville Chamberlain in 1939.

1:03:02.080 --> 1:03:03.640
That would have been better.

1:03:03.680 --> 1:03:07.000
So because there are more
people who'd rather watch

1:03:07.040 --> 1:03:09.320
an old man take
a small car out of a box,

1:03:09.360 --> 1:03:14.280
than watch him endangering
an office junior or me
wearing a moustache,

1:03:14.320 --> 1:03:19.200
we have to deduce that
the best of the small
hot hatchbacks

1:03:19.240 --> 1:03:21.240
is comfortably the worst.

1:03:21.280 --> 1:03:23.320
Yeah, that is our conclusion.

1:03:23.360 --> 1:03:25.320
And on that terrible
disappointment,
it's time to end.

1:03:25.360 --> 1:03:27.560
Thank you so much for
watching, see you next time.
Goodbye!
