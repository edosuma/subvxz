WEBVTT

00:02.103 --> 00:03.521
<i>Previously on</i> The 100...

00:09.193 --> 00:11.321
You started a war that
you don't know how to end.

00:11.821 --> 00:13.621
You have no idea what
your people have done...

00:14.365 --> 00:15.366
The forces you unleashed.

00:15.533 --> 00:18.453
- We had to stop the attack.
- You stopped nothing.

00:18.620 --> 00:20.389
We have to get out of here
while we still got the chance.

00:20.413 --> 00:22.832
- I love you.
- Not the way that I want to be loved.

00:23.458 --> 00:25.335
<i>Not the way that you love Clarke.</i>

00:25.501 --> 00:26.753
It's over, Finn.

00:26.919 --> 00:28.939
The dropship is still tied in
to all of our major systems.

00:28.963 --> 00:31.049
If it launches,
the Ark will be crippled

00:31.215 --> 00:32.655
and everyone left on board will die.

00:35.094 --> 00:36.971
Launch!

00:39.682 --> 00:41.893
- Your mom's early.
- Something's wrong.

01:00.745 --> 01:03.581
First watch is over.
Go relieve Monroe on the south wall.

01:03.748 --> 01:05.123
Keep your eyes open.

01:13.591 --> 01:15.093
Anything?

01:18.346 --> 01:19.972
It's been two days.

01:20.139 --> 01:22.433
Maybe the bomb at the bridge
scared them off for good.

01:23.768 --> 01:25.353
You believe that?

01:28.940 --> 01:30.108
No.

01:31.526 --> 01:32.860
They're coming.

01:36.781 --> 01:38.701
Jasper thinks he can cook up
some more gunpowder,

01:38.783 --> 01:40.201
if he gets some sulfur.

01:40.326 --> 01:42.495
And Raven says she can
turn that into landmines.

01:42.954 --> 01:46.040
So... be careful where you step.

01:46.749 --> 01:47.792
Funny.

01:47.959 --> 01:50.039
What I really need is 1,000 more
of her tin can bombs

01:50.128 --> 01:52.728
so I can roll into their village
and blow those Grounders to hell.

01:54.966 --> 01:57.260
That's what they want to do to us.

01:58.511 --> 02:00.138
I can't believe we survived
for 100 years

02:00.304 --> 02:02.557
just so we could
slaughter each other.

02:02.724 --> 02:04.434
There has to be another way.

02:06.018 --> 02:07.729
Any word from the Ark?

02:07.895 --> 02:09.604
Radio silence.

02:11.983 --> 02:13.776
Finally ran out of air.

02:17.989 --> 02:22.118
Maybe my mom was lucky,
being on the Exodus ship.

02:23.327 --> 02:24.829
At least it was quick.

02:28.416 --> 02:30.543
No one's coming down to save us.

03:29.435 --> 03:30.895
Hello?

03:32.355 --> 03:33.940
Is anyone there?

03:39.403 --> 03:40.863
Hello?

03:59.841 --> 04:01.926
Let's get this party smoking.

04:07.223 --> 04:08.503
You don't want the fire too big,

04:08.558 --> 04:11.310
so maybe just try to knock
it down with some wet leaves.

04:11.477 --> 04:14.272
You get that from your boyfriend,
Grounder Pounder?

04:14.438 --> 04:15.773
She's right.

04:15.940 --> 04:18.067
A hot fire is not gonna
preserve the meat as well.

04:18.233 --> 04:21.237
You can't take the heat,
get out of the Smokehouse.

04:21.404 --> 04:24.490
You should be kissing our asses
for being allowed back in this camp.

04:24.991 --> 04:26.701
Just keep working.

04:30.538 --> 04:33.207
Your brother couldn't
get you a better job?

04:33.875 --> 04:36.627
Anything would be better
than working in the meat furnace.

04:36.794 --> 04:38.462
Probably.

04:38.629 --> 04:40.840
That just means someone else
would have to do it.

04:50.975 --> 04:52.560
What's for dinner?

04:54.353 --> 04:55.813
Split loads.

04:56.480 --> 04:59.025
Turning one bullet into two.

05:00.151 --> 05:02.111
It's all I can do until
we get more gunpowder.

05:03.029 --> 05:05.239
Jasper has a recipe.

05:05.406 --> 05:08.367
Yesterday, I saw him taking
buckets from the latrine.

05:08.534 --> 05:10.036
I didn't ask.

05:11.037 --> 05:12.663
Is one of those for me?

05:13.664 --> 05:16.208
Maybe.
Still deciding.

05:20.338 --> 05:23.090
I keep wanting to apologize again.

05:24.842 --> 05:27.637
You don't have to.
We're good.

05:31.015 --> 05:33.267
I got to get this done.

05:33.434 --> 05:35.394
- That's bad.
- What?

05:35.561 --> 05:37.480
When you're really pissed off,

05:37.647 --> 05:40.858
you always find a project,
something to keep your hands busy,

05:41.025 --> 05:43.527
so you don't punch someone
in the face.

05:45.696 --> 05:47.531
I'm not keeping busy, Finn.

05:48.741 --> 05:50.743
I'm keeping us alive.

05:55.539 --> 05:58.709
Yeah. You're right.
That was a dumb thing to say.

05:58.876 --> 06:00.378
See you later.

06:03.339 --> 06:04.882
Wait.

06:09.804 --> 06:13.057
We're good.
We're good.

06:13.557 --> 06:14.557
We are.

06:16.727 --> 06:19.105
I just want you to be happy.

06:19.271 --> 06:21.357
<i>Guys! Fire!</i>

06:21.524 --> 06:24.026
<i>- Go, go, go!
- Come on!</i>

06:28.406 --> 06:29.907
Are you okay?

06:35.079 --> 06:38.249
This is all your fault.
We told you it was too much wood!

06:38.416 --> 06:39.750
Get the hell away from me!

06:42.128 --> 06:44.088
Hey! Hey!

06:44.296 --> 06:47.466
Stop! Save it for the Grounders.

06:48.342 --> 06:50.386
Well, now what
the hell are we gonna do?

06:51.012 --> 06:52.888
That was all the food.

07:10.156 --> 07:11.449
Any idea what happened?

07:11.615 --> 07:13.576
Murphy says that Del
kept feeding the fire,

07:13.743 --> 07:17.705
mostly because Octavia
told him it was a bad idea.

07:17.872 --> 07:20.291
- And we believe Murphy?
- I do. Yeah.

07:20.458 --> 07:23.627
We have some wild onions
and nuts in the dropship.

07:23.711 --> 07:26.714
It's only enough to last us
maybe one or two weeks.

07:26.964 --> 07:28.340
What's left here?

07:28.632 --> 07:31.886
Nothing. It all burned.

07:36.390 --> 07:37.808
Then we have to hunt.

07:39.226 --> 07:40.728
Anyone we can spare goes out.

07:41.270 --> 07:42.790
With the whole Grounder army
out there?

07:42.897 --> 07:45.816
Look, we can't defend ourselves
if we're starving.

07:48.986 --> 07:51.489
Each group takes
someone with a gun.

07:52.198 --> 07:54.283
And they're for killing Grounders,
not food.

07:54.450 --> 07:56.160
We don't have the ammo.

07:56.327 --> 07:58.746
Use the spears for hunting.

07:58.913 --> 08:01.040
Get what you can.
Be back by nightfall.

08:01.207 --> 08:03.542
No one stays out after dark.

08:07.671 --> 08:10.800
Hey, Clarke?
You alone?

08:11.509 --> 08:13.511
You maybe want to go together?

08:14.512 --> 08:17.014
Sure. I'll get some gear.

08:20.309 --> 08:21.519
You ready to go?

08:23.020 --> 08:24.688
I don't think so.

08:25.940 --> 08:27.483
Come on. I'm a good tracker.

08:27.650 --> 08:29.410
You're lousy with a spear,
but you're sneaky.

08:29.527 --> 08:30.986
We make a good team.

08:32.780 --> 08:35.241
Hey, partner, we're wasting daylight.

08:35.407 --> 08:37.118
Finn, you're joining the band?

08:37.284 --> 08:40.287
- Sure.
- Awesome.

08:40.453 --> 08:42.432
Haven't really got a chance
to hang with you guys much.

08:42.456 --> 08:44.917
Do you even know how
I got arrested on the Ark?

08:45.584 --> 08:47.294
I'm dying to hear about it.

09:00.558 --> 09:02.226
We need more ammo.

09:03.894 --> 09:06.772
That's it until Jasper gets back.
Now, get out of my tent.

09:07.106 --> 09:09.859
- Where you going?
- The hell out of here.

09:10.734 --> 09:14.113
- No way. You're not leaving.
- Really?

09:14.738 --> 09:17.241
And what makes you think
you can tell me what to do?

09:18.325 --> 09:19.994
Aren't you a janitor?

09:21.287 --> 09:23.497
- Where you gonna go?
- Into these damn woods.

09:23.664 --> 09:26.333
Don't worry about it.
I'll find someplace safe.

09:27.793 --> 09:29.336
Just wait.

09:31.172 --> 09:33.090
Don't be an idiot.

09:34.258 --> 09:37.428
You go alone, and you're dead,
or worse.

09:41.765 --> 09:43.601
So what's your plan...

09:43.767 --> 09:45.436
sit here until
you run out of bullets?

09:47.354 --> 09:50.274
Yeah. Or until you come up
with something better.

09:51.567 --> 09:52.818
Come on, Raven.

09:52.985 --> 09:56.113
You came down here in a pod
you rebuilt yourself.

09:56.280 --> 09:58.657
You made a bomb out of a tin can.

09:59.491 --> 10:01.452
What else you got
in that head of yours?

10:05.372 --> 10:06.415
Radios.

10:06.582 --> 10:08.792
We can't defend ourselves
if we can't communicate.

10:08.959 --> 10:11.212
If we can build radios,
walkie-talkies...

10:11.378 --> 10:14.548
Then we can fight as a team.
We'd have a chance, at least.

10:14.715 --> 10:16.800
See?
We need you.

10:16.967 --> 10:19.470
You may be a huge pain in the ass,
but you're smart.

10:26.060 --> 10:27.436
Anybody there?

10:28.646 --> 10:29.813
Hello?

10:39.615 --> 10:42.660
<i>♪ Fifty-six bottles of beer on the wall ♪</i>

10:45.412 --> 10:46.914
Hello?

10:53.003 --> 10:54.129
Hello?

10:54.296 --> 10:56.924
<i>♪ Fifty-five bottles of beer ♪</i>

10:57.091 --> 10:59.385
<i>♪ Take one down, pass it around ♪</i>

10:59.551 --> 11:02.304
- Hey. Hey, can you hear me?
- What do you want?

11:02.554 --> 11:05.683
Councilor, sir?

11:05.849 --> 11:09.270
It's Wick, isn't it?
From engineering. Sinclair's apprentice.

11:09.436 --> 11:10.688
Yeah, yeah.

11:10.854 --> 11:13.190
He had me come down here to override
the containment codes,

11:13.357 --> 11:15.234
to keep the doors open.

11:15.401 --> 11:16.860
Don't tell him I messed up.

11:19.321 --> 11:20.614
You didn't mess up.

11:21.782 --> 11:23.367
We need to get your arm free.

11:23.534 --> 11:25.995
Yeah, let's...
Let's do that.

11:26.161 --> 11:27.913
That sounds like a good idea.

11:34.628 --> 11:36.463
Did you see anyone else around here?

11:36.630 --> 11:38.674
No. Heard there was a
hull breach in engineering.

11:38.841 --> 11:42.177
- It was a breach?
- What the hell happened, anyway?

11:45.889 --> 11:48.350
We were betrayed.

11:48.517 --> 11:51.312
Councilor Sydney...

11:51.478 --> 11:54.064
she took the Exodus ship by force.

11:54.231 --> 11:56.942
Damage to the Ark was catastrophic.

11:57.901 --> 11:59.403
What a bitch.

12:00.070 --> 12:01.864
My mom voted for her.

12:03.198 --> 12:05.868
I'm not gonna be able to open
these doors without some help.

12:06.035 --> 12:08.537
- I'll be right back.
- You can't leave me, man.

12:08.704 --> 12:10.080
I won't leave you here.

12:13.751 --> 12:15.252
All right.

12:30.351 --> 12:33.103
Oh, my God, thank you!
That was great...

12:36.231 --> 12:37.608
Easy.

12:39.610 --> 12:40.861
I can hear the pumps.

12:41.028 --> 12:42.738
I think the vents
are working up ahead.

12:44.198 --> 12:45.407
Let's go.

12:45.991 --> 12:48.494
If you survived,
there could be others.

12:50.913 --> 12:52.706
<i>It's like a ghost ship.</i>

13:10.057 --> 13:12.393
One of those scaly panther things?

13:12.559 --> 13:14.144
No. Boar.

13:14.311 --> 13:18.607
Good, because that
panther meat is nasty.

13:19.650 --> 13:22.319
But I could eat a whole
boar by myself, no joke.

13:24.321 --> 13:27.116
You know what the best part is?
Of the boar?

13:28.492 --> 13:30.077
It's gonna sound gross.

13:30.244 --> 13:32.454
Myles, quiet for a second.

13:32.955 --> 13:34.706
What is it?

13:34.873 --> 13:36.291
These tracks.

13:39.169 --> 13:41.171
They're perfect.

13:41.338 --> 13:42.965
Too perfect.

13:44.842 --> 13:46.593
We're the ones being hunted.

13:48.929 --> 13:50.180
I don't see anything.

13:54.351 --> 13:56.812
Myles!

14:00.816 --> 14:03.110
Clarke, come on.
We got to leave him.

14:06.280 --> 14:07.656
- Clarke!
- No.

14:29.595 --> 14:31.638
Oh, yeah. Here.

14:32.264 --> 14:34.683
Hey, how's the air in here?

14:35.267 --> 14:36.518
Crappy.

14:37.769 --> 14:39.855
I'm gonna check
the next few compartments.

14:40.814 --> 14:41.482
Whoa, hey.

14:41.565 --> 14:44.125
Are you sure you want to do that?
This ship took a lot of damage.

14:44.234 --> 14:46.588
You walk through the wrong door,
you could be stepping out into space.

14:46.612 --> 14:48.155
We need to keep moving.

14:48.947 --> 14:50.866
The air in here
can turn bad at any time.

14:51.366 --> 14:52.618
At least we're breathing.

14:52.784 --> 14:55.496
The CO2 scrubbers down here
have kicked back on.

14:56.997 --> 14:58.707
They can restart themselves?

14:58.874 --> 15:00.542
No, the electrical fires
blew out a DCDU.

15:00.709 --> 15:02.419
Everything is on manual.

15:08.550 --> 15:10.469
Is it getting cooler in here?

15:11.720 --> 15:13.096
I don't feel it.

15:14.306 --> 15:18.060
Could someone restart the central
cooling exchanges in this level?

15:18.560 --> 15:20.312
No. That runs
through the primary board.

15:20.479 --> 15:22.272
Earth monitoring.

15:25.108 --> 15:27.277
We need to get
these people moving. Now.

15:27.444 --> 15:31.031
- Move them where?
- The cooling air is a message.

15:32.032 --> 15:35.285
See, I think... I think there's
someone alive on Earth, monitoring.

15:36.119 --> 15:38.247
- The air is a message.
- Yeah.

15:38.413 --> 15:41.041
Okay. You have hypoxia, all right?

15:41.208 --> 15:43.919
So you're... You're working with
about ten percent of your brain.

15:44.086 --> 15:46.213
We need to get them moving now.

15:47.256 --> 15:49.716
I am not gonna let
these people die here.

16:10.654 --> 16:13.824
Yeah, we walked for about three miles
after crossing that creek,

16:13.991 --> 16:15.711
another two or so before
we got to the road.

16:15.826 --> 16:17.244
I don't think it matters, Finn.

16:18.662 --> 16:21.665
They didn't blindfold us, which means
they don't care what we saw.

16:22.666 --> 16:24.668
They're probably gonna kill us.

16:57.367 --> 16:59.286
What do you want from us?

17:05.709 --> 17:07.294
Help her.

17:08.086 --> 17:11.548
If she dies, he dies.

17:20.891 --> 17:23.060
Rest in peace, Earth monitoring.

17:25.228 --> 17:26.563
Let's check passageway four.

17:26.730 --> 17:29.566
No, we got a jammed pressure door
between us and pass four.

17:29.733 --> 17:32.194
And we can't get through here.
It's game over, man.

17:32.361 --> 17:34.863
I need to talk to whoever
is in there.

17:35.280 --> 17:37.366
"Please" would be nice.

17:46.375 --> 17:47.668
Watch this.

17:47.918 --> 17:49.836
Ha-ha!

17:54.174 --> 17:56.760
Earth monitoring, do you read?

18:00.639 --> 18:01.932
We read you.

18:02.391 --> 18:05.060
<i>Who is this?
Where are you?</i>

18:05.394 --> 18:09.356
Sir, it's good to hear your voice.

18:10.190 --> 18:14.403
Of course it's you, Kane.
You're too stubborn to die.

18:14.569 --> 18:16.238
I could say the same for you.

18:17.239 --> 18:21.118
- What is your situation?
- We have about a dozen survivors.

18:21.284 --> 18:23.370
That's good work, Councilor.

18:25.956 --> 18:31.211
Sinclair is rerouting power
and air to the mess hall.

18:31.378 --> 18:33.004
<i>Lead your people there.</i>

18:33.171 --> 18:35.215
After we get you.

18:36.425 --> 18:41.096
No. A fire burned through
most of our oxygen.

18:41.888 --> 18:46.309
We put it out,
but we don't have... very long.

18:46.476 --> 18:49.104
All access is blocked.

18:49.271 --> 18:53.859
We are reviving as many
Ark systems as we can...

18:55.152 --> 18:58.739
...before our oxygen runs out.

19:01.867 --> 19:03.034
I won't leave you to die.

19:03.201 --> 19:06.246
As your chancellor,
I am ordering you

19:06.413 --> 19:11.459
<i>to gather as many survivors
as you can and lead them</i>

19:11.484 --> 19:13.194
to the mess hall.

19:15.338 --> 19:18.258
Jaha out.

19:26.516 --> 19:28.351
Lead them to the mess hall.

19:28.518 --> 19:31.813
And when you get there,
organize a search.

19:31.980 --> 19:34.691
Station by station.
Look for survivors.

19:41.990 --> 19:45.494
Let's go to the mess hall.
Come on.

19:52.083 --> 19:53.418
Hey.

19:53.627 --> 19:56.505
The chancellor is right.
We all got to get out of here.

19:56.671 --> 19:59.132
This whole deck is
an electrical fire waiting to...

20:01.009 --> 20:04.054
That's why you need
to lead these people out of here.

20:05.388 --> 20:06.598
Please.

20:06.765 --> 20:08.975
So, what, you're got to
save everybody but yourself?

20:09.142 --> 20:10.727
This is nuts.

20:12.020 --> 20:13.563
No one else can die because of me.

20:15.232 --> 20:17.818
Go. Go.
Get yourselves to safety.

20:48.223 --> 20:49.599
On three.

20:50.475 --> 20:52.602
One, two, three!

20:56.106 --> 20:58.066
Her name is Tris.

20:58.233 --> 21:00.610
I can't do this.
I don't have any equipment.

21:00.777 --> 21:02.487
We'll provide you with what we can.

21:03.989 --> 21:05.699
Why do you think I can save her?

21:05.866 --> 21:09.327
- Lincoln told her.
- Yes. Our healer is gone.

21:09.494 --> 21:11.413
There's nothing we can do for her.

21:12.664 --> 21:15.709
For his sake, I hope you can.

21:16.418 --> 21:18.587
Clarke, you can do this.

21:20.171 --> 21:22.883
Wait.
What happened to her?

21:23.049 --> 21:25.635
She was on the bridge
when your bomb exploded.

21:26.761 --> 21:28.763
You did this to her.

21:48.325 --> 21:50.125
I found some good antenna wire
for the radios.

21:50.285 --> 21:51.828
This guy was using it to fix his bed.

21:51.995 --> 21:53.973
You find anything else from
the Exodus ship wreckage?

21:53.997 --> 21:56.333
Yeah, data log.

21:56.499 --> 21:58.043
Want to hear something weird?

22:03.798 --> 22:06.676
- Sounds like interference.
- Wait. It gets weirder.

22:06.843 --> 22:09.346
When the signal hit,
their nav system went nuts.

22:09.512 --> 22:12.849
They never got it back,
and then boom...

22:13.016 --> 22:15.310
It's like something
was jamming the signal.

22:15.936 --> 22:19.356
That is weird.
It also makes no sense whatsoever.

22:20.065 --> 22:21.316
Pull the drives and speakers.

22:21.483 --> 22:22.609
You want to strip it?

22:23.401 --> 22:24.629
We'll never find out
where they crashed.

22:24.653 --> 22:25.963
We need every component
we can get our hands on

22:25.987 --> 22:27.107
if we're gonna make walkies.

22:29.616 --> 22:32.243
- And I need the radio.
- No way.

22:32.410 --> 22:34.162
How are we supposed to
contact the Ark?

22:40.543 --> 22:42.379
The Ark's not there.

22:42.545 --> 22:45.173
You're listening to a hole
in the sky.

22:45.340 --> 22:48.134
Hey, my family is up there.

22:50.387 --> 22:51.638
I'm sorry.

23:07.404 --> 23:08.947
The hunters are back?

23:09.114 --> 23:11.074
- Is Finn with them?
- I don't think so.

23:11.241 --> 23:14.744
Hey, relax. I'm sure Clarke's
keeping him out of trouble.

23:36.391 --> 23:38.143
What are you doing in here?

23:39.310 --> 23:41.229
They don't waste time.
I'll give 'em that.

23:42.105 --> 23:44.190
What's it been, day and a half?

23:45.608 --> 23:47.944
You're mistaking me
for someone who cares.

23:48.111 --> 23:49.779
Time to move on.

23:59.372 --> 24:00.790
What are you doing?

24:00.957 --> 24:02.751
Moving on.

24:18.141 --> 24:20.393
I've never been with anyone but Finn.

24:22.687 --> 24:24.564
Take off your clothes.

24:30.570 --> 24:33.656
Fine.
I'll go first.

24:45.376 --> 24:47.837
If you're looking for
someone to talk you down,

24:48.004 --> 24:51.174
tell you that you're just
upset and not thinking straight...

24:52.217 --> 24:54.010
I'm not that guy.

24:57.806 --> 24:59.474
Good.

25:28.503 --> 25:31.172
- She's getting worse.
- Help me lift her up.

25:31.965 --> 25:33.758
My God. Here we go.

25:34.551 --> 25:37.262
She's not moving any air on the left.

25:38.555 --> 25:41.235
- There's fluid pressing on her lungs.
- I don't see an entry wound.

25:41.349 --> 25:44.227
No. It wasn't shrapnel.
It was trauma.

25:44.394 --> 25:47.230
The force of the explosion,
it hit her in the chest.

25:47.397 --> 25:49.732
She's drowning in her own blood.

25:50.483 --> 25:52.902
She can't breathe.
I have to relieve the pressure.

25:56.447 --> 25:58.032
I need a small tube,

25:58.199 --> 26:00.368
something rigid
the size of my finger.

26:07.458 --> 26:08.751
Here.

26:09.586 --> 26:11.171
Thanks.

26:14.924 --> 26:18.803
Fifth intercostal space.

26:23.057 --> 26:24.184
This better work.

26:34.444 --> 26:36.863
Okay. Attagirl. Breathe.

26:37.030 --> 26:38.364
What have you done?

26:38.531 --> 26:40.371
No. You don't understand.
She couldn't breathe.

26:42.035 --> 26:43.119
Back off!

27:03.723 --> 27:06.643
Everybody gets oxygen. Now!

27:08.519 --> 27:09.687
Sir...

27:11.522 --> 27:13.650
Sir, are you all right?

27:16.110 --> 27:18.488
I gave you an order.

27:18.655 --> 27:20.907
You're bound by law to follow.

27:21.199 --> 27:25.161
The people in this room
are our best chance to save the Ark.

27:27.163 --> 27:31.000
Besides, a wise man once told me...

27:32.669 --> 27:36.339
...I needed to learn
when not to follow the law.

27:37.840 --> 27:41.302
A wise man.

27:45.556 --> 27:46.891
Thank you.

27:56.484 --> 27:58.403
So what do we do now?

28:00.154 --> 28:02.865
She's breathing a little better,
but even if we can save her,

28:03.032 --> 28:04.659
what happens then?

28:04.826 --> 28:06.911
Then maybe we don't die today.

28:08.621 --> 28:10.331
She's hot.

28:16.713 --> 28:18.339
Her heart rate's way up.

28:19.048 --> 28:21.759
- She's probably septic.
- What does that mean?

28:23.011 --> 28:25.054
It means her blood's poisoned.

28:26.514 --> 28:29.225
- What about this stuff?
- That slows bleeding.

28:29.392 --> 28:31.019
Coagulant. No.

28:31.185 --> 28:33.104
Lincoln had that same stuff
at the dropship.

28:33.271 --> 28:36.983
I don't see any antibiotics.
Maybe that lake seaweed?

28:37.150 --> 28:39.110
She doesn't need seaweed.
She needs real medicine.

28:39.152 --> 28:41.195
How could you send
a little girl into battle?

28:41.362 --> 28:42.572
What is wrong with you people?

28:42.739 --> 28:44.407
She was with me.
She was my second.

28:45.533 --> 28:47.660
It's how we train them
to be warriors.

28:47.827 --> 28:49.454
So the killing can just go on and on.

28:49.620 --> 28:52.165
- Clarke...
- You put the bomb on the bridge.

28:52.332 --> 28:54.751
You did this to her!

28:58.880 --> 29:01.632
Blood.
She needs clean blood.

29:02.592 --> 29:03.926
Transfusion?

29:05.053 --> 29:06.822
Okay. There's no tubing,
so we need a syringe,

29:06.846 --> 29:09.515
the biggest one you can find.
And I need a cannula.

29:09.682 --> 29:11.100
It's like a hollow needle.

29:47.303 --> 29:48.763
Did that help?

29:50.306 --> 29:51.474
No.

29:54.894 --> 29:58.189
- Any word yet on casualties?
- No.

29:58.689 --> 30:02.485
Sinclair still has teams out
assessing the damage, but...

30:04.404 --> 30:06.614
...whole stations may have been lost.

30:06.948 --> 30:12.537
I estimate no more
than 1,000 survivors.

30:14.288 --> 30:17.250
At least 1,500 dead.

30:17.417 --> 30:19.710
Hey, guys, I found something.

30:19.877 --> 30:22.755
I'm sorry, sir.
Mr. Wick has trouble with protocol.

30:22.922 --> 30:25.299
- What did you find?
- Data from the Exodus launch.

30:25.466 --> 30:27.760
The monitor says
that service hatch beta

30:27.927 --> 30:32.223
was manually sealed
before the launch from our side.

30:33.474 --> 30:34.976
There was someone in the service bay?

30:35.143 --> 30:36.561
But there are survivors?

30:36.727 --> 30:38.229
People jumped ship
at the last moment?

30:38.396 --> 30:41.315
Maybe Sydney threw them off.
Maybe they were a threat.

30:43.609 --> 30:45.611
Could they still be alive
in the service bay?

30:46.821 --> 30:48.990
Well, sir, if they
hunkered down and got lucky,

30:49.157 --> 30:51.597
yeah, they could still be ticking,
but they won't be for long.

30:52.368 --> 30:56.080
Well, how do we get to them?
How can we get to them?

30:56.247 --> 30:59.876
We could try the maintenance shaft.

31:00.042 --> 31:02.545
It's sealed on both sides,
so you'd have pressurization.

31:02.712 --> 31:04.755
And it's pressed
right up against the fuel pods.

31:04.922 --> 31:08.551
Without power to the coolant system,
it'll be hot as hell in there.

31:10.052 --> 31:11.554
I have to try.

31:20.062 --> 31:23.191
- It's as sharp as it's gonna get.
- All right. Thanks.

31:26.235 --> 31:29.363
- Bleach.
- Guess there's no moonshine.

31:31.282 --> 31:33.534
- I'm gonna need your blood.
- No.

31:34.785 --> 31:37.747
You're from the same tribe.
It's the best match we're gonna get.

31:37.914 --> 31:40.833
Clarke, if you're gonna do something,
you have to do it now.

31:41.000 --> 31:42.710
Just use mine.

31:54.055 --> 31:55.223
I can't find a vein.

31:56.432 --> 31:58.768
She's clamping down.
She's lost too much blood.

31:59.560 --> 32:01.521
- Clarke...
- Oh, come on.

32:01.729 --> 32:03.272
She's not breathing.

33:05.376 --> 33:07.420
Take him away and kill him.

33:07.587 --> 33:09.255
No. No. No.

33:09.422 --> 33:11.674
No! Please, no!

33:11.841 --> 33:14.969
- I did everything I could. No!
- Clarke, stop. They'll hurt you.

33:16.178 --> 33:19.515
No! Get off!

33:20.099 --> 33:21.559
No!

33:29.025 --> 33:30.151
Hey!

33:32.778 --> 33:35.489
You'll need this battery
to open up the door to the bay.

33:37.450 --> 33:39.535
Good? Yeah?

33:50.713 --> 33:51.881
It's not that hot.

33:52.048 --> 33:53.692
Sinclair doesn't know
what he's talking about.

33:53.716 --> 33:54.967
It's a little warm.

33:56.677 --> 33:59.263
So... you're not gonna
talk me out of going?

33:59.764 --> 34:00.848
Nope.

34:04.393 --> 34:06.228
When you die,
can I have your shoes?

34:07.188 --> 34:10.232
They're much too stylish for you.

34:32.088 --> 34:33.547
You finished the walkies.

34:34.422 --> 34:35.841
Hey!

34:38.469 --> 34:41.222
I'm sorry about before.

34:41.889 --> 34:45.768
Really.
And about your family.

34:47.186 --> 34:48.603
Thanks.

34:50.356 --> 34:54.527
So, all the hunters are back
except Clarke and Finn.

34:54.735 --> 34:56.529
Okay.

34:56.696 --> 35:00.366
Raven, they were with another kid.
Myles.

35:00.533 --> 35:02.284
They all left camp together.

35:02.743 --> 35:04.286
All three of them
are still out there?

35:04.453 --> 35:06.497
Yeah. We're going to look for them.

35:06.664 --> 35:08.124
Bring the walkies.

36:15.274 --> 36:16.817
Come on.

36:18.277 --> 36:20.654
Hey, wake up.

36:25.034 --> 36:26.368
Abby?

36:28.537 --> 36:31.207
Abby, wake up.

36:37.171 --> 36:39.131
It's so hot.

36:47.348 --> 36:49.642
Anya will take no pleasure
in your friend's death.

36:51.060 --> 36:53.729
Prove your worth,
and you'll be welcomed here.

36:54.730 --> 36:59.068
I couldn't save Tris.
Why would you want me?

36:59.235 --> 37:01.695
We told you.
Our healer is gone.

37:12.039 --> 37:14.750
Will I be able
to go back to see them?

37:15.125 --> 37:18.587
My friends? My home?

37:21.048 --> 37:24.093
Tomorrow there'll be nothing
to go back to.

37:32.726 --> 37:34.687
Those marks on her shoulder,

37:34.854 --> 37:36.647
what were they?

37:36.814 --> 37:38.440
Lincoln has them, too.

37:38.607 --> 37:40.401
Each scar marks a kill in combat.

37:41.819 --> 37:43.946
Five kills?

37:45.489 --> 37:47.324
She was a little girl.

37:47.491 --> 37:49.118
She was brave.

37:51.704 --> 37:53.539
How many do you have?

38:00.296 --> 38:01.589
That's a lot.

38:01.755 --> 38:03.173
And half were after I hurt my knee.

38:15.060 --> 38:17.855
Shh, shh.

38:43.297 --> 38:45.215
Where are they?

38:45.633 --> 38:46.884
We'll find them.

38:47.051 --> 38:49.303
<i>I thought you said you were
heading west. Where are you?</i>

38:49.553 --> 38:50.793
<i>Just keep the moon on your left,</i>

38:50.930 --> 38:52.097
<i>and you'll find us.</i>

38:54.600 --> 38:56.143
This morning,
all I could think about

38:56.310 --> 38:59.647
was how much easier this would
all be if Finn was just...

39:01.523 --> 39:03.108
...gone.

39:03.692 --> 39:06.362
You didn't wish this
into being, Raven.

39:07.029 --> 39:08.697
Stop torturing yourself.

39:13.953 --> 39:15.353
Is anyone else hearing this signal?

39:15.829 --> 39:17.623
Just keep your eyes open.

39:18.123 --> 39:20.542
I think it's the same thing
we heard in the black box.

39:20.709 --> 39:22.002
Damn it, Monty, pay attention.

39:22.461 --> 39:24.546
<i>Do you see anything?</i>

39:25.506 --> 39:26.924
Report.

39:29.093 --> 39:30.719
Oh, my God.

39:38.769 --> 39:41.146
There's someone in the bushes.

39:57.871 --> 39:59.623
Myles?

40:00.666 --> 40:02.292
Myles, what happened?

40:02.459 --> 40:03.752
Where are they?

40:03.919 --> 40:05.838
Clarke and Finn, where are they?

40:06.422 --> 40:08.298
Grounders took them.

40:08.465 --> 40:10.300
Take it easy.

40:10.467 --> 40:12.136
We have to get him back to camp.

40:12.511 --> 40:14.096
Bell, what about Clarke and Finn?

40:20.769 --> 40:23.772
Raven, I'm sorry.

40:30.529 --> 40:32.448
We need to make a stretcher.

40:35.617 --> 40:37.870
Monty, we're heading home.
You copy?

40:40.122 --> 40:41.957
Monty, can you hear me?

40:47.671 --> 40:49.048
Monty.

40:50.674 --> 40:53.969
Monty, where the hell are you?

40:55.304 --> 40:56.847
<i>Report.</i>

40:57.681 --> 40:59.475
<i>Monty!</i>
