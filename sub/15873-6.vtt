00:01.458 --> 00:04.417
[Emma]  A few months ago
I discovered I had
a twin sister

00:04.417 --> 00:07.000
and then she asked me
to take her place.

00:07.000 --> 00:11.000
Keep the secret,
find our real mother
and try to stay alive.

00:11.000 --> 00:13.166
Put yourself in my shoes.

00:13.166 --> 00:16.333
How long could you keep up
the lying game?

00:16.333 --> 00:20.167
-What is this?
-It's a journal,
handwritten by Kristin Mercer.

00:20.167 --> 00:23.750
All about how she didn't even
want me in the first place

00:23.750 --> 00:25.209
and how she wanted
to give me back.

00:25.209 --> 00:26.291
[Kristin] Those were
just my feelings--

00:26.291 --> 00:27.625
And how about
your feelings for Alec?

00:27.625 --> 00:29.333
We all feel things
we shouldn't sometimes.

00:29.333 --> 00:30.667
I don't remember her name,

00:30.667 --> 00:32.250
but you look
an awful lot like her.

00:32.250 --> 00:34.375
-Is this her?
-[Rebecca] Yes.

00:34.375 --> 00:35.834
That's your birth mother.

00:35.834 --> 00:38.208
Rebecca was protecting
the secret that she was
your birth mother.

00:38.208 --> 00:39.333
That's why Derek was killed.

00:39.333 --> 00:41.250
Jordan Lyle.
We should look into him.

00:41.250 --> 00:43.209
See what his connection is
with Rebecca.

00:43.209 --> 00:46.083
Rebecca's been there for me.
Now I owe her.

00:46.083 --> 00:48.750
Alec was not framed.
He killed Derek Rogers.

00:48.750 --> 00:49.959
[Laurel screams]

00:49.959 --> 00:51.000
Laurel?

00:53.209 --> 00:55.083
-Will you marry me, baby?
-Yes.

00:55.083 --> 00:57.083
There are two of us.

00:57.083 --> 01:00.041
Laurel, I'm Emma,
Sutton's twin sister.

01:01.333 --> 01:02.834
[siren wailing]

01:05.333 --> 01:08.125
[indistinct
announcement on PA]

01:10.583 --> 01:13.084
Laurel?

01:13.084 --> 01:15.583
No, I'm not going
to calm down!

01:15.583 --> 01:17.000
Basically,
ever since you got here,

01:17.000 --> 01:18.875
it's been lie on top of lie.

01:18.875 --> 01:21.166
Whose idea
was it to switch,
you or Sutton's?

01:22.291 --> 01:23.959
Sutton's.

01:23.959 --> 01:26.125
But it was only
so she can look
for our birth mother.

01:26.125 --> 01:28.625
It was only supposed to be
for a few days

01:28.625 --> 01:30.208
and then it all
just kind of snowballed,

01:30.208 --> 01:33.167
and she found out
a bunch of stuff

01:33.167 --> 01:35.417
that led back here to Rebecca,

01:35.417 --> 01:39.125
and she's our birth mother.

01:39.125 --> 01:41.166
[scoffs] Rebecca.

01:41.166 --> 01:43.291
And all the switching
in between?

01:43.291 --> 01:47.000
Yes, all the switching,
all the back and forth, it...

01:47.000 --> 01:48.375
[sighs]

01:48.375 --> 01:49.625
It's crazy.

01:49.625 --> 01:53.834
Neither of you
trusted me enough to tell me.

01:53.834 --> 01:55.834
I should go in there
to Mom and Dad right now.

01:55.834 --> 01:57.375
You should have gone to them
months ago!

01:57.375 --> 02:00.333
You have to listen
to me, please.

02:00.333 --> 02:02.417
There is a serious reason

02:02.417 --> 02:04.875
why you can't go
and tell your mom and your dad

02:04.875 --> 02:07.042
or Sutton or anybody.

02:07.042 --> 02:08.166
Because if anyone found out

02:08.166 --> 02:11.000
that you know
about me and Sutton...

02:13.792 --> 02:15.167
Your life could be in danger.

02:16.875 --> 02:18.333
[sniffles]

02:18.333 --> 02:20.166
I...

02:20.166 --> 02:22.166
I got to get back to my room.

02:22.166 --> 02:23.208
Wait.

02:25.083 --> 02:26.125
-Laurel...
-[door opens]

02:28.000 --> 02:29.333
I thought
I'd find you up here.

02:29.333 --> 02:32.084
You pulled the same stunt
when you got your tonsils out.

02:32.084 --> 02:33.708
Come on,
let's get you back in bed

02:33.708 --> 02:35.500
before Mom and Dad
find out and freak.

02:54.834 --> 02:55.917
♪ Uh ♪

02:55.917 --> 02:57.417
♪ Uh, uh-uh ♪

02:57.417 --> 02:59.792

02:59.792 --> 03:01.166

03:01.166 --> 03:04.417

03:05.917 --> 03:07.083
[Emma] They've
been there all night.

03:07.083 --> 03:08.875
Sutton never left her side.

03:08.875 --> 03:11.125
[Thayer] I really doubt
Laurel spilled.

03:11.125 --> 03:14.000
I'm telling you, Thayer,
she was really pissed

03:14.000 --> 03:16.167
and kind of scared.

03:16.167 --> 03:19.291
Yeah, but she has gotten close
to you these last few months.

03:19.291 --> 03:21.375
She has to know
that you're the one
giving her good advice.

03:21.375 --> 03:22.917
She had 16 years with Sutton.

03:22.917 --> 03:24.166
They couldn't have
all been bad.

03:24.166 --> 03:26.625
Well, trust me,
I was there for most of it

03:26.625 --> 03:29.208
and it was not pretty.

03:29.208 --> 03:30.250
Here they come.

03:33.041 --> 03:34.875
[Thayer] Looks good so far.

03:34.875 --> 03:36.250
If she said something
about you to Sutton

03:36.250 --> 03:38.917
it'd be an entirely
different scene.

03:38.917 --> 03:41.583
[Emma] It's one thing
to keep her quiet

03:41.583 --> 03:44.209
but another
to get her to help.

03:44.209 --> 03:45.000
I have an idea.

03:46.583 --> 03:47.959
You always do.

03:49.042 --> 03:50.542
Let's go.

03:51.667 --> 03:53.167
[grunting]

03:56.667 --> 03:58.333
Dan!

03:58.333 --> 04:00.166
Oh, my God.

04:01.375 --> 04:03.542
They're beautiful.

04:03.542 --> 04:05.041
Yeah, I wonder who sent them.

04:05.041 --> 04:06.875
They're for an
Ethan Whitehorse.

04:06.875 --> 04:08.084
[sighs]

04:15.625 --> 04:17.333
-Hurry up.
-All right, all right.

04:19.333 --> 04:20.750
They're from Sutton.

04:20.750 --> 04:23.125
She's inviting me
to the flipside formal.

04:23.959 --> 04:25.917
[chuckling] What?

04:25.917 --> 04:27.834
Okay, what is
a flipside formal?

04:27.834 --> 04:29.625
I'm guessing it's when
the girls ask the guys.

04:29.625 --> 04:32.000
Guess I should put these
in some water or something,
right?

04:33.375 --> 04:35.875
Wipe that smile off your face,
or I'll do it for you.

04:35.875 --> 04:37.125
I'm sorry, it just seems like

04:37.125 --> 04:39.959
you and Sutton
are getting tight again.

04:39.959 --> 04:41.291
Work out all your problems,
did you?

04:42.125 --> 04:43.166
Pretty much, yeah.

04:44.042 --> 04:45.875
[chuckles]

04:45.875 --> 04:47.792
He's not going to
that thing, no way.

04:47.792 --> 04:49.209
Uh, yeah, he is,

04:49.209 --> 04:51.667
even if I have to
get him the tux myself.

04:51.667 --> 04:53.291
Why don't you ever
get me flowers?

04:54.708 --> 04:57.166
Because you got a ring.

04:57.166 --> 04:58.417
[laughs]

04:59.875 --> 05:02.041
-I forgot.
-Mmm.

05:02.041 --> 05:05.000
Why are you so hell-bent
on living alone?

05:05.000 --> 05:06.959
Just move in here,
you're back.

05:06.959 --> 05:08.667
I already got a room
at the club.

05:08.667 --> 05:09.875
Oh, come on, it's rent-free.

05:09.875 --> 05:11.250
-You can talk to Dad.
-Yeah, right.

05:11.250 --> 05:14.042
Oh, don't twist
his arm, Maddie.

05:14.042 --> 05:15.708
I don't think
he likes the price.

05:16.708 --> 05:20.000
You see,
he'd have to apologize

05:20.000 --> 05:21.959
for sending me to prison
for something I didn't do.

05:23.125 --> 05:24.208
He'd have to admit
he was wrong,

05:24.208 --> 05:27.208
and I don't think you're ready
to do that yet, son, are you?

05:27.208 --> 05:28.917
No. No, I'm not.

05:33.250 --> 05:35.083
Thayer, he was cleared
of all charges.

05:35.083 --> 05:37.417
-Can't you just let it go?
-No, we can't.

05:37.417 --> 05:39.250
"We"?
As in you and Emma?

05:41.209 --> 05:43.084
So you guys are together?

05:43.084 --> 05:45.708
Back investigating
and all this craziness
starts again?

05:45.708 --> 05:48.084
Unfortunately,
it never stopped.

05:52.291 --> 05:54.042
Look who's back.

05:54.042 --> 05:55.291
Hey, Ethan.

05:58.209 --> 05:59.500
Is Emma with you?

05:59.500 --> 06:02.917
She was worried
about her sister
so I drove her back.

06:02.917 --> 06:04.166
We're staying.

06:06.250 --> 06:07.792
What about you and Sutton?

06:08.667 --> 06:10.000
-What about us?
-I don't know.

06:10.000 --> 06:11.000
I figured you guys
got back together.

06:12.125 --> 06:14.167
That's good figuring.

06:14.167 --> 06:16.166
So you guys are back from L.A.

06:16.166 --> 06:18.167
Sounds like you might have
found something out there.

06:20.583 --> 06:22.084
You know what?

06:22.792 --> 06:24.500
I don't even care.

06:24.500 --> 06:25.750
Let's keep it that way.

06:43.083 --> 06:44.792
Too bad
you'll miss the formal.

06:44.792 --> 06:47.291
I hope you didn't ask anyone.

06:47.291 --> 06:49.667
Although, I figure that's why
you were at Rebecca's,

06:49.667 --> 06:51.041
to ask Jordan.

06:51.041 --> 06:55.083
Although, scaling his wall
may have looked a little...

06:56.000 --> 06:57.166
Weird?

06:57.166 --> 06:59.500
I was gonna say pathetic.

06:59.500 --> 07:01.042
Are you sure
you're gonna be okay?

07:01.458 --> 07:03.000
Yeah. I'm good.

07:03.000 --> 07:04.250
Good.

07:04.250 --> 07:06.291
Let me know
if you need anything.

07:06.291 --> 07:08.500
Oh, I can't wait
to get out of this dress.

07:09.750 --> 07:10.959
[Emma] Hey.

07:10.959 --> 07:12.209
[Laurel sighs]

07:12.209 --> 07:14.041
Forget the bump on the head.

07:14.041 --> 07:16.458
You keep popping up like this,
I might have a heart attack.

07:16.458 --> 07:17.959
Thank you
for not saying anything.

07:18.875 --> 07:20.250
Why?

07:20.250 --> 07:22.625
That's what I don't get,
is all this secrecy.

07:22.625 --> 07:24.125
If you know
Rebecca's your birth mother

07:24.125 --> 07:26.542
then why not just confront her
and ask her if she knows?

07:28.458 --> 07:30.917
Who else knows about
you and Sutton?

07:30.917 --> 07:35.000
Mads and Ethan and Thayer.

07:35.000 --> 07:36.667
You said it was dangerous.

07:36.667 --> 07:39.041
Does that mean, like,
Rebecca's dangerous?

07:40.500 --> 07:42.291
She could be.

07:42.291 --> 07:44.084
If you want me
to keep my mouth shut,

07:44.084 --> 07:45.667
you're gonna have to tell me
what's going on.

07:46.000 --> 07:47.208
Okay.

07:48.917 --> 07:53.250
We think Sutton and Rebecca
are working together secretly,

07:53.250 --> 07:57.417
and one or both of them

07:57.417 --> 08:00.166
may be involved
in Derek's murder.

08:01.000 --> 08:04.625
Emma. Oh, my gosh, this... No.

08:04.625 --> 08:06.750
That they'd kill
to keep the secret?

08:07.125 --> 08:08.417
Why?

08:09.250 --> 08:10.667
I don't know.

08:10.667 --> 08:12.959
I honestly don't know
and that's

08:12.959 --> 08:15.708
what we're gonna try
and figure out.

08:15.708 --> 08:18.500
It's just, this family
means so much to me.

08:18.500 --> 08:22.125
I mean,
I love you like a sister.

08:25.542 --> 08:27.166
[doorbell rings]

08:28.250 --> 08:30.083
[Sutton] Ethan.
[Ethan] How's it going?

08:30.083 --> 08:31.625
[Sutton] Come on in.

08:31.625 --> 08:32.917
[Ethan] Thanks.

08:36.333 --> 08:37.708
[Sutton]
So you got my flowers,

08:37.708 --> 08:39.667
you're thrilled to be
asked to the formal,

08:39.667 --> 08:41.542
you graciously accept,
and now you just need to know

08:41.542 --> 08:42.875
my dress color

08:42.875 --> 08:45.291
so you can pick out
a corsage, right?

08:46.542 --> 08:47.959
Or it's something else.

08:49.125 --> 08:51.167
I saw Thayer
at the country club.

08:53.417 --> 08:55.166
And he told you
he's moving back

08:55.166 --> 08:56.583
with Emma.

08:56.583 --> 08:59.500
And now, you have this
big black cloud over you,

08:59.500 --> 09:01.042
the Emma cloud.

09:02.333 --> 09:03.834
-Well--
-You know what?

09:03.834 --> 09:05.125
I don't want to talk about it.

09:05.125 --> 09:06.417
Think about
what you want to do

09:06.417 --> 09:08.000
and give me your answer.

09:11.125 --> 09:12.209
[sighs]

09:13.417 --> 09:14.583
I don't know, Emma.

09:14.583 --> 09:16.500
I really don't know
if I can do this.

09:22.000 --> 09:24.959
I'd call
Jordan Lyle your typical
Beverly Hills teenager,

09:24.959 --> 09:28.208
you know, joy-riding,
underage drinking,
that kind of stuff.

09:28.208 --> 09:29.458
Rich kid rap sheet.

09:29.458 --> 09:30.750
Wonder how
he stayed out of juvie.

09:30.750 --> 09:33.250
Oh, wait. Don't tell me.
Daddy's checkbook.

09:33.250 --> 09:34.750
That's what I thought
until I called daddy.

09:34.750 --> 09:36.291
He wanted to go tough love
with the kid

09:36.291 --> 09:38.792
but his ex-wife
wouldn't allow it.

09:38.792 --> 09:40.708
Rebecca cleans up the messes.

09:40.708 --> 09:43.500
"Thick as thieves"
is how Mr. Lyle described it.

09:43.500 --> 09:46.042
-Exact words.
-Thieves or...

09:46.042 --> 09:47.125
Come here.

09:48.500 --> 09:51.667
Look, if they killed someone,
they need a motive, right?

09:51.667 --> 09:53.750
Right? Well, I'm sorry,
I don't see it,

09:53.750 --> 09:55.417
but apparently, you do.

09:55.417 --> 09:57.000
Damn it, Theresa,
this whole thing

09:57.000 --> 10:00.125
would be a lot easier for me
if, if you could just tell me

10:00.125 --> 10:02.083
what Alec told you
when he was in jail.

10:02.083 --> 10:04.167
-[sighs]
-I mean, isn't there

10:04.167 --> 10:07.042
a statute of limitations
on attorney-client privilege?

10:07.042 --> 10:09.041
You know that there isn't.

10:09.041 --> 10:12.500
And what Alec told me,
it was in private.

10:12.500 --> 10:14.083
It's a family matter.

10:14.083 --> 10:15.834
A family matter.

10:15.834 --> 10:18.166
I'm suspecting that
these "family matters"

10:18.166 --> 10:19.834
are at the center
of this whole thing.

10:19.834 --> 10:22.000
I mean, come on, he's got us
investigating his wife,

10:22.000 --> 10:23.375
his stepson.

10:23.375 --> 10:24.917
His own kids
had him thrown in jail.

10:24.917 --> 10:27.000
I think family has
everything to do with this.

10:28.042 --> 10:29.166
I'm sorry, Dan.

10:29.166 --> 10:30.875
I'm sorry, too.

10:33.542 --> 10:36.125
Excuse me, sweetheart.
Can I have some privacy,
please?

10:36.125 --> 10:37.166
Yeah.

10:37.166 --> 10:39.500
So I thought
I'd find you here.

10:39.500 --> 10:43.792
Have I mentioned
how wonderful it is
being me again?

10:43.792 --> 10:46.834
All of this
and just so much more.

10:46.834 --> 10:49.333
So are we okay
in the Laurel department?

10:49.333 --> 10:51.667
Yeah.
She's tucked away at home

10:51.667 --> 10:54.583
and no more mention of twins.

10:54.583 --> 10:56.208
I think we dodged that one.

10:56.208 --> 10:58.417
-And Emma?
-[sighs]

10:58.417 --> 11:00.959
Back at the cabin, I assume.

11:00.959 --> 11:01.959
But still in town.

11:03.167 --> 11:04.167
Thayer, too.

11:05.125 --> 11:06.125
What, are you thinking that

11:06.125 --> 11:08.708
Laurel's not the only reason
they came back?

11:08.708 --> 11:11.375
Laurel followed you
to my house.

11:11.375 --> 11:14.333
And I explained to everyone
at the hospital

11:14.333 --> 11:16.750
her mad crush on Jordan.

11:16.750 --> 11:18.458
Yeah, but we'll
never really know
if they bought it.

11:18.458 --> 11:20.667
They did. Trust me.

11:20.667 --> 11:23.333
Well, that's just it, Sutton.

11:23.333 --> 11:25.166
Sometimes
I don't know if I can.

11:31.000 --> 11:33.166
[Emma]
Trust is everything in this,
and I get it.

11:33.166 --> 11:35.083
Laurel spent her whole life
with the real Sutton,

11:35.083 --> 11:36.708
and then we come along

11:36.708 --> 11:39.125
telling her
that Sutton's been lying.

11:39.125 --> 11:42.250
I know exactly how she feels
because I feel the same way.

11:42.250 --> 11:43.792
I feel hurt and betrayed.

11:43.792 --> 11:46.708
Doesn't seem like she's
going to blow us out
of the water, though.

11:46.708 --> 11:49.542
She said that
Sutton lied to Ethan,

11:49.542 --> 11:51.166
that she snuck over
to Rebecca's

11:51.166 --> 11:53.083
and it wasn't just
a casual visit to see Mads.

11:53.083 --> 11:55.625
I think Rebecca
is the key to this,

11:55.625 --> 11:59.125
and we just need to get Sutton
out of the way.

11:59.125 --> 12:01.167
She does have
an Achilles' heel.

12:01.875 --> 12:03.167
And what would that be?

12:03.167 --> 12:05.125
Well, it's a "who," actually.

12:05.125 --> 12:07.375
And you are our ticket in.

12:09.125 --> 12:10.500
No.

12:10.500 --> 12:12.834
-Mmm-mmm.
-Come on.

12:12.834 --> 12:15.291
[Theresa] My guess
is that you're working
Rebecca from the inside

12:15.291 --> 12:17.542
and that this whole marriage
is a sham.

12:17.542 --> 12:19.000
That's a dark view of humanity

12:19.000 --> 12:21.291
for someone
that's just about
to get married.

12:21.291 --> 12:23.125
But it's a good guess.

12:23.125 --> 12:25.959
And you're allowing
Mads to live here,

12:25.959 --> 12:28.875
which is surprising,
considering your suspicions.

12:28.875 --> 12:31.417
I don't have a suspicious bone
in my body, Theresa.

12:31.417 --> 12:33.209
[scoffs]

12:33.209 --> 12:34.542
Now, what do you have
on Jordan Lyle?

12:34.542 --> 12:36.333
Mischief, but that's it.

12:36.333 --> 12:38.792
Daddy doesn't like him
and his step-mommy
bails him out.

12:38.792 --> 12:40.667
But, you know, I've been
thinking about motive

12:40.667 --> 12:42.625
for Rebecca, for Jordan.

12:42.625 --> 12:45.000
And if it's the twins' secret
that she's trying to keep,

12:45.000 --> 12:46.792
what, what's the purpose?

12:46.792 --> 12:48.125
Leave motive to me.

12:48.125 --> 12:49.583
But it's the key
to all of this.

12:49.583 --> 12:52.333
And Dan's all over it
and I can't tell him anything.

12:52.333 --> 12:54.125
No. [chuckles] No.

12:54.125 --> 12:55.583
-No, you can't.
-But you can.

12:55.583 --> 12:57.167
And if you do,

12:57.167 --> 12:59.042
he'll stop
asking me questions,
and I'll be off the hook.

12:59.042 --> 13:02.208
Anybody who knows
the secret of the twins
is in danger.

13:02.208 --> 13:04.583
Time has proven that
to be true.

13:04.583 --> 13:06.959
Look what happened
to Derek Rogers.

13:06.959 --> 13:09.167
You don't want Dan
to be next, do you?

13:09.167 --> 13:12.000
But if the key
to finding the killer
is the twins' secret...

13:12.000 --> 13:13.583
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Would you be careful

13:13.583 --> 13:16.917
how loud you say
the word "twins"?

13:16.917 --> 13:20.167
Now, hand me the folder
and put on a smile.

13:20.167 --> 13:21.667
Why?

13:21.667 --> 13:24.042
Because my beautiful wife
is watching us.

13:29.583 --> 13:32.917
Jordan, I want you
to take Laurel to this formal.

13:32.917 --> 13:35.041
I can't.
Girls have to ask the guys.

13:37.417 --> 13:39.708
Well, I'm sure
you'll find a way.

13:39.708 --> 13:41.750
Laurel was climbing
over my wall for a reason

13:41.750 --> 13:44.084
and I want you to find out
what it is.

13:46.042 --> 13:47.625
Why should I help you?

13:47.625 --> 13:51.542
You ditched tutoring,
went out to L.A.

13:51.542 --> 13:53.792
to be with Thayer.

13:55.291 --> 13:58.000
Well, you're with Sutton now.

13:58.000 --> 13:59.625
Yes, I am.

14:01.375 --> 14:03.000
She's been different
since you left.

14:04.208 --> 14:06.583
Well, that's great.

14:07.959 --> 14:09.625
Look, we found out
some things in L.A.

14:11.500 --> 14:13.209
What kind of things?

14:13.209 --> 14:15.083
Things like...

14:15.083 --> 14:17.875
Rebecca is our birth mother.

14:17.875 --> 14:20.166
And we think
Sutton has been
working with her

14:20.166 --> 14:23.250
all this time,
and that she's known

14:23.250 --> 14:25.209
and that they're
keeping this secret.

14:26.250 --> 14:28.583
I can't just walk away.

14:30.209 --> 14:31.875
I have too many questions.

14:33.125 --> 14:34.333
[scoffs]

14:34.333 --> 14:35.542
And you need my help?

14:36.834 --> 14:38.542
Yes, I do.

14:38.542 --> 14:40.667
[stutters] I...

14:40.667 --> 14:41.917
You what?

14:45.917 --> 14:47.583
I just want
all the secrets to end.

14:47.583 --> 14:49.375
I want it all to be
out in the open,

14:49.375 --> 14:51.208
and I think you do, too.

14:53.959 --> 14:55.084
[sighs]

14:57.209 --> 14:58.625
I'm sorry, Emma.

14:59.792 --> 15:01.417
You're on your own.

15:08.375 --> 15:09.875
[bell rings]

15:20.209 --> 15:21.583
Can I help you?

15:24.500 --> 15:26.959
-I accept.
-What?

15:26.959 --> 15:28.125
I know it's bucking tradition,

15:28.125 --> 15:30.208
but I thought I could
ask you to ask me

15:30.208 --> 15:31.333
to the flipside formal.

15:32.708 --> 15:34.917
-I assumed Mads asked you.
-Nope.

15:34.917 --> 15:37.250
Besides,
I like a girl who stalks.

15:37.250 --> 15:38.875
-I wasn't stalking you.
-Yeah?

15:38.875 --> 15:41.042
Look at it this way,
if you take me to the dance,

15:41.042 --> 15:43.041
you'll have a chance
to tell me how much
you're not into me.

15:43.041 --> 15:44.875
Oh, I can tell you
that right now.

15:44.875 --> 15:46.542
Well, good.
I'll pick you up early.
Say, 6:00?

15:46.542 --> 15:49.750
I'm guessing you'll
probably wanna go
to dinner first, right?

15:49.750 --> 15:51.708
Just put these back in.

15:51.708 --> 15:53.167
I'll see you then.

15:57.084 --> 15:58.166
Hey, you.

15:58.166 --> 16:00.000
Hey.

16:00.000 --> 16:04.084
So I can't officially
ask you to the formal,

16:04.084 --> 16:07.792
but I thought maybe
we could get together
a group or something.

16:07.792 --> 16:10.000
I kind of already said yes
to Laurel.

16:10.000 --> 16:12.417
Before you get all crazy,
I only said yes for a cover.

16:12.417 --> 16:15.125
-You know, for us.
-"A cover"?

16:15.125 --> 16:17.167
Yeah.

16:17.167 --> 16:20.041
You said yes
to Laurel, my friend,

16:20.041 --> 16:22.000
who apparently
still has a huge crush on you.

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
Mads, you know
how I feel about you.

16:24.000 --> 16:26.708
Yeah, well, right now
I'm a little confused.

16:31.291 --> 16:33.041
[door opens]

16:34.166 --> 16:36.125
-Hey, Mom.
-Hi, honey.

16:39.166 --> 16:40.166
Are you okay?

16:41.834 --> 16:44.875
I met with
Lindsey Ridgeway today.

16:44.875 --> 16:46.917
-The divorce lawyer?
-I mean, it's just so weird.

16:46.917 --> 16:50.291
She was going through
your father's finances

16:50.291 --> 16:54.792
and it looked like he was
taking some withdrawals,
in cash.

16:54.792 --> 16:58.125
Small enough amounts
so that I wouldn't notice,

16:59.167 --> 17:02.500
adding up to $20,000.

17:04.125 --> 17:05.333
I, I don't get it.

17:06.750 --> 17:08.125
I mean,
she said it could be...

17:08.125 --> 17:11.083
I mean, it could be anything,
even an affair.

17:11.083 --> 17:13.208
And it...
It's around the same time

17:13.208 --> 17:15.084
that Rebecca was in town.

17:15.084 --> 17:17.542
Wait a second. This is, like,
another affair with Rebecca?

17:17.542 --> 17:19.917
Separate from
their affair in the past?

17:19.917 --> 17:21.750
The dates match up.

17:21.750 --> 17:24.917
I mean, he could have been
using the money for anything,

17:24.917 --> 17:28.667
hotels or
expensive dinners out.

17:28.667 --> 17:31.792
[scoffs]
God, this is just insane.

17:34.917 --> 17:36.083
I know.

17:37.917 --> 17:40.959
I thought your dad and I could
maybe work it out, but now...

17:44.000 --> 17:46.458
Oh, sweetie,

17:46.458 --> 17:47.750
I'm so sorry.

17:49.750 --> 17:51.208
We are gonna
figure this out,

17:53.042 --> 17:55.000
and you guys
are gonna be fine.

17:55.000 --> 17:56.708
I promise.

17:57.750 --> 17:58.792
I love you.

18:03.042 --> 18:04.042
[sighs]

18:06.333 --> 18:08.209
[siren wailing]

18:08.209 --> 18:10.084
Dan.

18:10.084 --> 18:12.000
-I spoke with Alec.
-Let me guess.

18:12.000 --> 18:14.291
You're here to tell me
that you're still not gonna
tell me.

18:15.834 --> 18:18.250
Officer Whitehorse.

18:18.250 --> 18:20.542
Mrs. Rogers. Hello.
What are you doing here?

18:20.542 --> 18:22.875
I found something
you need to see.

18:27.458 --> 18:29.000
I mean, tell me
why I should stay quiet.

18:29.000 --> 18:31.542
Give me one good reason.
I mean, all this insane talk

18:31.542 --> 18:34.750
about murders and secrets?

18:34.750 --> 18:36.667
Why don't you come forward?

18:36.667 --> 18:38.167
Or I know.

18:38.167 --> 18:39.959
We'll both come forward.

18:39.959 --> 18:42.125
We can go to your brother
or my parents.

18:42.125 --> 18:44.167
I can tell my father
anything,

18:44.834 --> 18:47.417
or I used to be able to.

18:47.417 --> 18:49.667
Laurel, we can't. Okay?

18:49.667 --> 18:51.667
[Laurel] Why not?

18:51.667 --> 18:55.083
Because of everything
Emma said.

18:55.083 --> 18:58.917
Okay, hold on.
She wants your help
but you won't do it,

18:58.917 --> 19:02.125
but when she wants my help
you think I should do it.

19:02.125 --> 19:04.000
So that's hypocritical.

19:06.083 --> 19:09.625
Look, if you care
about your family,

19:09.625 --> 19:12.042
about Emma,
then you will help.

19:12.042 --> 19:13.042
Okay?

19:14.167 --> 19:15.458
And you don't care
about Emma anymore?

19:20.917 --> 19:22.667
It's just not about me.

19:22.667 --> 19:24.917
Oh, come on!

19:24.917 --> 19:27.041
This is all about you.
I know you're with Sutton now

19:27.041 --> 19:29.333
and you're trying
to stay out of it,

19:29.333 --> 19:31.167
but you're
right in the middle.

19:32.291 --> 19:33.959
You know what?

19:33.959 --> 19:36.209
I suddenly feel less alone.

19:38.041 --> 19:39.625
You and I
are on the same ship,

19:40.417 --> 19:42.125
and it's sailing fast.

19:55.834 --> 19:57.375
[Theresa] Please, sit down.

20:01.125 --> 20:03.875
I, I know you're not
on the case anymore,

20:03.875 --> 20:06.209
but you seem to be
the only cop who cares about

20:06.209 --> 20:07.583
finding my son's murderer.

20:08.375 --> 20:11.125
I was replacing my rosebushes,

20:11.125 --> 20:14.542
and I found this
buried in my garden.

20:17.166 --> 20:18.417
It's Derek's.

20:18.417 --> 20:19.834
And there's more money there

20:19.834 --> 20:22.042
than I've
ever seen in my life.

20:27.458 --> 20:29.333
[Emma] Cheating again?

20:29.333 --> 20:31.041
We know he had the affair
with Rebecca.

20:31.041 --> 20:33.125
Yeah, my mom said
it's more recent.

20:33.125 --> 20:34.708
She thinks it even could
have been Rebecca,

20:35.959 --> 20:38.417
but my dad spent $20,000.

20:38.417 --> 20:40.208
What?

20:40.208 --> 20:41.792
Okay, no, no, no,
there has to be

20:41.792 --> 20:43.209
some sort of
explanation for it.

20:43.209 --> 20:44.917
He wouldn't do that to Mom.

20:46.000 --> 20:48.125
Sorry.
He wouldn't do it to Kristin.

20:48.125 --> 20:50.834
No, it's okay.
I know how much
you care about her.

20:51.834 --> 20:54.209
Laurel, I'm really sorry

20:54.209 --> 20:56.792
about lying to you
all this time.

20:56.792 --> 20:59.083
Well, that's why
we have to focus
on getting the truth

20:59.083 --> 21:01.458
so you can tell everyone
who you really are.

21:02.125 --> 21:04.250
Oh, absolutely.

21:04.250 --> 21:07.250
I never thought
I'd have a sister like you.

You've done nothing
but try to keep this
family together.

Ethan made me realize
what side I should be on.

21:14.583 --> 21:15.625
Ethan?

21:17.083 --> 21:18.792
I'll keep your secret, Emma.

21:18.792 --> 21:20.000
[Thayer] I'm back.

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000

for this formal.

-What?
-Laurel's gonna help.

21:36.583 --> 21:37.834
[Ethan] And so am I.

21:39.667 --> 21:42.208
You said you wanted to
bring all this to a head,

21:42.208 --> 21:44.125
I assume that means
some kind of trap.

21:44.125 --> 21:45.667
Exactly. At the formal.

21:46.500 --> 21:47.959
The formal.

21:47.959 --> 21:50.000
And I'm taking Sutton, so...

You look great.

22:11.209 --> 22:12.250
Thank you.

22:12.250 --> 22:13.750

an idea of what

22:13.750 --> 22:15.583
Dan's gonna look like
on our wedding day.

22:15.583 --> 22:17.500
[coughs] What?

22:17.500 --> 22:19.125

getting married in jeans.

22:19.125 --> 22:20.250
Well...

22:23.000 --> 22:24.792
All right, so what'd they say?

22:26.208 --> 22:29.084
My narcotics contact
says that there's no way

22:29.084 --> 22:30.458
Derek could have been
a big enough player

22:30.458 --> 22:32.333
to make
that kind of money dealing.

22:32.333 --> 22:34.166
Then, where did it come from?

22:34.166 --> 22:35.542
My theory is,

22:35.542 --> 22:38.000
he was being paid
to keep quiet about something.

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
[Dan] Yeah, until
whoever it was decided

22:40.000 --> 22:41.708
they weren't
gonna pay anymore.

22:41.708 --> 22:43.166

to buckle that seat belt.

that I'm Sutton,

26:44.875 --> 26:47.000

Maybe she would
reveal something.

at Derek's place.

So Rebecca may have been
paying him to keep quiet.

you and Sutton.

She and Thayer have
some scheme to fool
Rebecca and Sutton.

32:06.125 --> 32:09.250
I'm supposed to be pumping
Jordan for information,

32:09.250 --> 32:10.750
but it's an epic fail.

32:10.750 --> 32:13.166
But Emma said that
she and Thayer were
staying in tonight.

32:14.625 --> 32:17.209
I think they wanted to
keep it on the DL.

32:17.209 --> 32:20.000
But, yeah, that's crazy
that they wouldn't tell you.

32:20.000 --> 32:23.000
I mean, unless you have
a secret twin, too.

32:24.084 --> 32:25.291
No.

32:25.291 --> 32:27.166
I can't believe
they didn't tell me.

32:28.333 --> 32:30.125
[cell phone ringing]

32:42.375 --> 32:44.041
Okay, now's my chance.

32:47.041 --> 32:48.542
Hey, Sutton.

32:51.000 --> 32:52.417
Hi.

32:52.417 --> 32:55.708
Um, I have to run,
but I'll catch you later.

32:55.708 --> 32:58.917
You're really taking after
Sutton these days, Emma.

32:58.917 --> 33:00.792
Lying right to my face.

33:00.792 --> 33:03.834
[sighs]
Oh, God, Mads.
I'm really sorry.

33:03.834 --> 33:06.042
It's just you've been
so caught up with

33:06.042 --> 33:09.458
all the family stuff
and Jordan and...

33:09.458 --> 33:11.500
Well, we just didn't think...

33:11.500 --> 33:12.959
That you could trust me?

33:14.583 --> 33:17.000
That's great. Just great.

33:19.875 --> 33:22.084
Hey. What was that about?

33:22.084 --> 33:26.667
Just more lies
and more hurting people.

33:26.667 --> 33:27.834
God, Ethan, this is so nuts.

33:27.834 --> 33:29.083
Why am I here?
What am I doing?

33:29.083 --> 33:31.708
You're getting the proof
that you need.

33:31.708 --> 33:35.084
Emma, look,
Rebecca paid Derek $20,000

33:35.084 --> 33:37.625
to keep him quiet, and then
she killed him, all right?

33:37.625 --> 33:39.084
This is your chance
to get her alone.

33:39.084 --> 33:40.792
Now, you gotta go do it.
Come on.

33:40.792 --> 33:43.041
Did you just say "$20,000"?

33:43.041 --> 33:44.917
Yeah, that's what they
found at Derek's house.

33:44.917 --> 33:46.708
What difference does it make?

33:48.000 --> 33:50.084
All the difference
in the world.

34:01.792 --> 34:03.041
What the hell happened?

34:03.041 --> 34:05.583
They kidnapped me
and sent Emma in my place.

34:05.583 --> 34:07.750
I think they were going to try
and trick you

34:07.750 --> 34:09.417
and get you
to reveal something, I...

34:09.417 --> 34:11.125
They suspect
we're working together.

34:11.125 --> 34:14.125
And they obviously used Ethan
to bait you.

34:15.917 --> 34:17.000
Yeah, he was in on it.

34:17.000 --> 34:19.792
They knew your weakness.
I was afraid of this.

34:19.792 --> 34:22.750
Look, I got here,
and I warned you.

34:22.750 --> 34:25.000
You know, Emma has had
over a dozen chances

34:25.000 --> 34:26.458
to approach me
but she never did.

34:26.458 --> 34:29.792
Are we just lucky here
or did something else
stop her?

34:29.792 --> 34:31.208
I think we should
bring Emma in on it.

34:31.208 --> 34:35.000
-We, we can get her--
-Absolutely not.

34:35.000 --> 34:37.834
-[waiter] Can I
take that for you?
-Thank you.

34:39.792 --> 34:43.084
You need to remember, Sutton,
I make the plans.

34:47.167 --> 34:48.917
I thought we would have
found her by now.

34:48.917 --> 34:50.209
It doesn't matter.

34:50.209 --> 34:51.417
Hey.

34:51.417 --> 34:53.792
Emma had her shot,
she didn't take it.

34:53.792 --> 34:55.167
[footsteps approaching]

34:55.167 --> 34:56.333
[Thayer] Oh, there she is.

34:59.000 --> 35:00.333
Never mind.

35:00.333 --> 35:02.708
Where's Emma,
fixing her lipstick?

35:02.708 --> 35:05.125
What is this, like,
a threesome now?

35:05.125 --> 35:07.125
Seems to be the
only explanation
I can come up with.

35:07.125 --> 35:10.625
She loved my life so much
she up and stole it.

35:10.625 --> 35:12.834
Will you just be honest, okay?

35:12.834 --> 35:15.125
I mean, you talk
and you talk about it
all the time.

35:15.125 --> 35:17.041
Have you ever actually
been honest with me?

35:17.041 --> 35:19.959
-About anything?
-You want honesty, Brutus?

35:19.959 --> 35:22.041
-Yeah.
-I'll give you honesty.

35:22.041 --> 35:24.084
I am done with you.

35:25.291 --> 35:27.166
I'm done with all of you.

35:28.417 --> 35:30.542
All right, we gotta find Emma.
We gotta see what--

35:30.542 --> 35:33.125
No, no. You already had
your night with her, okay?

35:33.125 --> 35:34.667
I'll find her.

35:37.917 --> 35:41.667
What was the name
of that cheap,
cheap wine you snuck in?

35:41.667 --> 35:43.042
It began with a "T."

35:43.042 --> 35:46.291
Um, Tyrone. Tyrolia!

35:46.291 --> 35:47.792
-Tyrolia.
-Tyrolia.

35:47.792 --> 35:50.792
Super sweet, with a finish
like a freight train.

35:50.792 --> 35:53.875
And if I recall,
you were on a quest
to polka with everyone.

35:54.667 --> 35:56.625
And I damn near did, too.

35:57.708 --> 36:00.000
I know I polkaed with you.

36:01.792 --> 36:03.000
[chuckles]

36:07.625 --> 36:11.084
There was something that night
I wanted to do that I didn't.

36:13.959 --> 36:15.417
What's that?

36:26.834 --> 36:28.125
This.

36:40.917 --> 36:42.375
Good night, Kristin.

36:47.917 --> 36:48.917
[door opens]

36:50.000 --> 36:52.500
-Good night.
-[door closes]

36:52.500 --> 36:55.250
[Rebecca] Well, look at that.

36:55.250 --> 36:56.834
It's been five minutes

36:56.834 --> 36:59.917
and you haven't run off
or insulted me.

36:59.917 --> 37:02.375
Please, when have
I ever insulted you?

37:02.375 --> 37:05.166
I don't know, I guess
I just read between the lines.

37:07.209 --> 37:09.333
So it was a good dance,
don't you think?

37:09.333 --> 37:11.875
It was well-chaperoned.

37:11.875 --> 37:15.042
Jordan and Laurel,
they're cute together.

37:15.625 --> 37:17.250
Yeah, they are.

37:19.042 --> 37:20.167
Hmm.

37:20.959 --> 37:22.834
What are you thinking about?

37:22.834 --> 37:26.208
Another Sadie Hawkins,
back in our high school days.

37:26.208 --> 37:28.583
Kristin asked me,
I was on cloud nine.

37:29.708 --> 37:31.125
I forget who took Alec.

37:32.083 --> 37:34.333
Some icy blond with falsies?

37:36.000 --> 37:38.125
-You?
-My sister.

37:38.125 --> 37:39.708
Ah!

37:39.708 --> 37:43.041
You know,
I was at that Sadie Hawkins

37:43.041 --> 37:44.917
as a sophomore.

37:45.542 --> 37:47.542
Who'd you ask?

37:47.542 --> 37:49.708
It doesn't matter.

37:49.708 --> 37:52.042
I spent the whole evening
staring at you

37:52.042 --> 37:54.125
wishing I had the courage
to ask you.

37:57.250 --> 37:58.708
I didn't know.

37:58.708 --> 38:00.291
I know you didn't.

38:02.708 --> 38:04.041
But I can ask you now.

38:06.750 --> 38:08.458
Will you dance with me, Ted?

38:11.500 --> 38:13.375
Flipside formal.

38:13.375 --> 38:15.750

38:40.875 --> 38:43.750
If Ted had an affair
with Rebecca 17 years ago,

38:43.750 --> 38:46.333
that means that he could
be Sutton's and my father

38:46.333 --> 38:50.000
and he was trying to keep it
a secret, mainly from Kristin.

that Kristin said

Why is it,
that when I'm hiding

you're always the one

I got left out again.

39:51.500 --> 39:53.500

and now Laurel.

39:53.500 --> 39:56.042
It's like I got
voted off the island.

What's your story?

40:01.042 --> 40:02.166
'Cause you're looking
a little like

40:02.166 --> 40:04.167

40:05.125 --> 40:07.125
No, don't tell me.

40:08.375 --> 40:10.000
You and Sutton broke up.

40:11.208 --> 40:13.375
But you were never
really together

40:13.375 --> 40:16.000
because you'll never
get over Emma.

40:35.125 --> 40:36.500
Better idea.

40:36.500 --> 40:39.875
Why don't we split this wine

40:39.875 --> 40:43.000
and we'll talk
till the sun comes up?

40:44.209 --> 40:45.291
Hmm.

40:46.333 --> 40:47.667
Deal.
