WEBVTT

00:01.068 --> 00:05.072
(Her space holiday's
"the new kid revival" playing)

00:09.076 --> 00:11.945
I love sex with you.

00:12.012 --> 00:16.015
Do you think it's gonna change
after we get married?

00:16.082 --> 00:17.985
It doesn't have to.

00:18.051 --> 00:20.020
When I was 7,
I loved banana pudding.

00:20.087 --> 00:23.056
I did. I loved it.
I ate it every day.

00:23.123 --> 00:26.059
And then one morning,
I woke up and I looked down

00:26.126 --> 00:28.061
and I realized I hated it.

00:28.128 --> 00:32.031
Is our sex life gonna be like
that banana pudding?

00:32.098 --> 00:34.968
I think my banana pudding
has more staying power

00:35.035 --> 00:36.036
than you are used to.

00:36.103 --> 00:37.971
Come here.

00:38.038 --> 00:38.972
Mm.

00:39.039 --> 00:40.974
Come here. Thank you.

00:41.041 --> 00:43.010
For what?

00:43.076 --> 00:45.979
For finding me...

00:46.046 --> 00:49.016
And for making me
feel so safe.

00:49.082 --> 00:52.953
So let's start
the new kid revival

00:53.020 --> 00:56.023
we'll make it up
as we go along

00:56.089 --> 00:58.959
so where
are you headed today?

00:59.026 --> 01:01.061
I have to go to the imperial.

01:01.128 --> 01:03.997
I have, um, a meeting
with the caterers,

01:04.063 --> 01:05.966
you know, final tweaks.

01:06.033 --> 01:08.936
Are you sure your father's
gonna be okay

01:09.002 --> 01:10.938
with us getting married
at his home?

01:11.004 --> 01:12.940
No, daddy talks
a big game and--

01:13.006 --> 01:14.942
well,
and he handles the money--

01:15.008 --> 01:16.944
but when it comes to
ceremonies and holidays,

01:17.010 --> 01:19.980
he doesn't really have a say.
That's mommy's department.

01:20.047 --> 01:22.015
Oh. Oh.
It'll be fine.

01:22.082 --> 01:24.017
Okay.
Trust me.

01:24.084 --> 01:26.954
This wedding cannot take place.
It cannot.
Well, it's tomorrow.

01:27.020 --> 01:28.989
People are flying in
from all over the world.

01:29.056 --> 01:30.991
It's all my fault.

01:31.058 --> 01:33.994
No, it was Karen's idea
to spy on Simon.
I let her do it.

01:34.061 --> 01:36.997
I let her wander
into that den of inequity.

01:37.064 --> 01:39.032
Look, what do you
want me to do?

01:39.099 --> 01:42.035
We have to find
a way out of it.

01:42.102 --> 01:45.038
Set up a meeting
with Simon elder.
All right.

01:45.105 --> 01:46.974
And, Nick.

01:47.040 --> 01:49.977
Yeah.

01:50.043 --> 01:53.981
I find myself enthralled with
our young house guest Wrenn.

01:54.047 --> 01:55.949
Yeah, you told me
the other night.

01:56.016 --> 01:59.019
I wonder if you could arrange
a-a luncheon

01:59.086 --> 02:00.954
for the three of us.

02:01.021 --> 02:02.022
Okay.

02:02.089 --> 02:04.024
And could you do
one other thing?

02:04.091 --> 02:05.993
Yeah, what's that?

02:06.059 --> 02:08.027
Could you please...

02:08.095 --> 02:10.030
Not show up?

02:10.097 --> 02:13.033
Uh, w--do you think
that's a good idea?

02:13.100 --> 02:15.969
Why, is there something
I should know?

02:16.036 --> 02:17.938
Tell me, please.

02:18.005 --> 02:19.006
I'll set it up.

02:19.072 --> 02:21.108
Good. Thank you.

02:25.045 --> 02:27.948
Manhattan had renewable energy
400 years ago...
(Remote beeps)

02:28.015 --> 02:31.018
And we're ready to do it again.
So you want me to build
my biodiesel plant

02:31.084 --> 02:34.988
right here
in New York City?
For starters.

02:35.055 --> 02:37.958
Well, it's a fine idea,
senator.

02:38.025 --> 02:42.930
And your tax incentives
are competitive, Ms. lyons.

02:42.996 --> 02:46.033
And there's no way
I'm signing with you.

02:46.099 --> 02:49.970
May I ask why exactly?

02:50.037 --> 02:52.005
Ask your father. He burned me
in business deals...

02:52.072 --> 02:55.943
Oh, Mr. O'Connell--
twice, and he did it in a way
a man doesn't forget,

02:56.009 --> 02:58.946
in a way that made me
want to come here

02:59.012 --> 03:01.048
and say no
to you personally.

03:01.114 --> 03:03.050
Give your dad my best.

03:05.052 --> 03:07.020
I'll take care of this.

03:07.087 --> 03:09.022
Mr. O'Connell.
(Elevator bell dings)

03:09.089 --> 03:10.991
Mr. O'Connell. Mis--

03:11.058 --> 03:12.025
hey.

03:12.092 --> 03:13.961
(Lowered voice)
What? Not now.

03:14.027 --> 03:15.963
(Normal voice)
Mr. O'Connell, please. Sir...

03:16.029 --> 03:18.999
Not interested.
Sir, Tripp Darling
and Patrick Darling

03:19.066 --> 03:20.968
have nothing to do
with one another.

03:21.034 --> 03:23.937
I'm telling you,
please reconsider...

03:24.004 --> 03:26.006
Why are you here?
It's my bro's office.
N'est pas?

03:26.073 --> 03:28.976
He works for the people.
Me people.

03:29.042 --> 03:31.011
Was that the Evan O'Connell?
He's taller in person.

03:31.078 --> 03:33.947
I am not gonna let you
cost me another job.

03:34.014 --> 03:35.949
Okay, this has gotta stop.
Or start again.

03:36.016 --> 03:37.985
I'd rather eat glass.
Get a life.

03:38.051 --> 03:41.021
I have a life.
Find a better way
to spend it.

03:41.088 --> 03:43.924
(Door slams)

03:43.991 --> 03:46.994
♪♪♪

03:47.060 --> 03:47.995
Hey.

03:48.061 --> 03:48.996
Hello.

03:49.062 --> 03:50.931
How are you?

03:50.998 --> 03:51.999
(Chuckles)

03:52.065 --> 03:54.001
You look like
you're feeling better.

03:54.067 --> 03:56.937
I think I'm fine,
but Tripp keeps saying

03:57.004 --> 04:00.007
I can't leave
until I'm 100%, so...

04:00.073 --> 04:02.976
(Laughs)

04:03.043 --> 04:05.979
Nobody suspects
that we're meeting for coffee.

04:06.046 --> 04:07.948
So don't worry.

04:08.015 --> 04:09.950
Well, I'm not--
I'm not worried.

04:10.017 --> 04:13.053
I just, uh--
listen, uh...
About the other night.

04:13.120 --> 04:14.054
Yeah.

04:14.121 --> 04:17.958
I don't normally kiss guys
I just met.

04:18.024 --> 04:20.060
Well, I--
just so you know.

04:20.127 --> 04:22.963
I hadn't drawn
any conclusions.

04:23.030 --> 04:25.999
But it was nice.
You're very sweet.

04:26.066 --> 04:27.968
He is sweet, isn't he?

04:28.035 --> 04:30.938
Lisa.

04:31.004 --> 04:32.973
Uh, you remember
Wrenn from...

04:33.040 --> 04:36.043
Yes, from my battle royale
with Karen. How could I forget?

04:36.109 --> 04:38.011
Sorry to break up
the sweetness.

04:38.078 --> 04:40.948
You brought her here,
to our place?

04:41.014 --> 04:43.951
You know what? Um,
I can go if you two--

04:44.017 --> 04:45.018
no.
No.

04:45.085 --> 04:47.955
No.
No, stay, please.
It's a free country, obviously.

04:48.021 --> 04:49.990
I e-mailed you
Kiki's midterm grades.

04:50.057 --> 04:52.926
Her teachers says
she's a little distracted,

04:52.993 --> 04:55.996
but I will let you two
get back to your conversation.
Lisa...

04:56.063 --> 04:57.998
It's nice to know
mourning our marriage

04:58.065 --> 05:00.067
hasn't gotten in the way
of your dating.
Lisa--

05:00.133 --> 05:02.970
don't. Just don't.
(Sighs)

05:03.036 --> 05:04.972
Oh, pardon me.
(Beep)

05:05.038 --> 05:06.039
Jeremy, it's me.

05:06.106 --> 05:07.975
I have a question,

05:08.041 --> 05:10.978
and it's not a question
because you don't have a choice.

05:11.044 --> 05:12.980
So listen up.

05:13.046 --> 05:15.949
(Letitia) Wrenn is not
what she appears to be.

05:16.016 --> 05:17.985
I-I c--I can feel it
in my bones.

05:18.051 --> 05:19.953
Letitia--

05:20.020 --> 05:21.955
don't you "Letitia" me.

05:22.022 --> 05:24.024
Your father used to say it
just like that.

05:24.091 --> 05:25.959
(Sighs)

05:26.026 --> 05:27.961
I have a-a gold digger

05:28.028 --> 05:30.998
sinking her claws
into my marriage.

05:31.064 --> 05:33.967
I think that you are being
a little dramatic.

05:34.034 --> 05:35.969
Dramatic?
I heard Tripp tell you

05:36.036 --> 05:38.972
that girl has him thinking
he can do better than me.

05:39.039 --> 05:40.040
I heard it.

05:40.107 --> 05:43.944
Three friends of mine
have lost their husbands

05:44.011 --> 05:46.947
to women like this
in the last six months.

05:47.014 --> 05:50.951
I will not join the ranks
of the deserted.

05:51.018 --> 05:52.920
I will not die alone.

05:52.986 --> 05:54.988
Okay, what do you
want me to do?

05:55.055 --> 05:57.057
I want you to, I don't...
Do some checking,

05:57.124 --> 06:00.961
see if she has
a criminal record.
In all seriousness?

06:01.028 --> 06:03.030
What?
You hit the woman
with a car.

06:03.096 --> 06:06.967
(Scoffs)
Initiating a background check
on her on the heels of that

06:07.034 --> 06:09.970
could start
to look like harassment.

06:10.037 --> 06:12.039
There's nothing to be done.

06:12.105 --> 06:14.975
Oh, well. Hmm.

06:15.042 --> 06:17.010
Merci beaucoup.

06:17.077 --> 06:18.979
(Sighs)

06:19.046 --> 06:22.983
Oh, oh, and just, um,
so you know, Nick,

06:23.050 --> 06:25.919
Jeremy apparently

06:25.986 --> 06:28.021
has invited your wife
to Karen's wedding.

06:28.088 --> 06:31.058
I advised him against it,
of course, for your sake.

06:31.124 --> 06:32.025
Uh-huh.

06:32.092 --> 06:33.994
But... (Sighs)

06:34.061 --> 06:37.030
There was nothing to be done.

06:43.003 --> 06:46.106
What's on your mind, boys?
I can't wait to find out.

06:53.080 --> 06:55.983
It's blank.

06:56.049 --> 06:58.952
Fill it in with whatever figure
you think is appropriate.

06:59.019 --> 07:00.954
And walk away from Karen.

07:01.021 --> 07:02.956
(Laughs)

07:03.023 --> 07:05.926
Uh, no. I'm not interested.

07:05.993 --> 07:08.028
Get off your high horse,
Mr. elder.

07:08.095 --> 07:11.031
A man of your ilk
has a price for everything.

07:11.098 --> 07:13.934
Uh, money...
Is not what I want.

07:14.001 --> 07:15.035
We're listening.

07:15.102 --> 07:19.006
I have what is most valuable
to you.

07:19.072 --> 07:23.977
And you have what is
most valuable to me.

07:24.044 --> 07:25.979
The company.

07:26.046 --> 07:27.981
Your company
for your daughter.

07:28.048 --> 07:31.952
You sell me all of your shares--
all of 'em--

07:32.019 --> 07:35.022
voting rights,
at a fair market value,

07:35.088 --> 07:38.091
and I'll call off the wedding.

07:40.093 --> 07:42.095
Nick.

07:44.097 --> 07:47.034
Okay, then. I'm sorry.
I thought you loved Karen.

07:47.100 --> 07:49.069
I guess I was mistaken.

07:51.104 --> 07:56.009
You obnoxious, little piddling
son of a bitch.

07:56.076 --> 07:58.946
Hey, hey, no one
talks to me that way,

07:59.012 --> 08:02.049
not in my house,
not anywhere.

08:02.115 --> 08:04.952
Nick.

08:05.018 --> 08:06.954
I know it hurts
to lose her, Nick.

08:07.020 --> 08:08.021
But I tell you what,

08:08.088 --> 08:11.058
I'll make sure she throws
the bouquet in your direction.

08:11.124 --> 08:13.060
Okay?

08:15.028 --> 08:17.965
(Chuckles)

08:18.031 --> 08:23.003
♪♪♪

08:32.011 --> 08:33.947
Lisa's just trying
to make you jealous.

08:34.014 --> 08:35.948
You should take it
as a compliment.

08:36.015 --> 08:37.985
Well, I feel like I'm
in junior high school again.

08:38.051 --> 08:39.986
I remember a time
not so long ago,

08:40.053 --> 08:41.989
my problems were more adult.

08:42.054 --> 08:42.990
Well...

08:43.056 --> 08:44.992
We're all
back in the eighth grade

08:45.058 --> 08:46.994
when we're in love
with somebody.

08:47.060 --> 08:49.963
(Laughs) Yeah.
That's for sure.

08:50.030 --> 08:51.999
Ugh.

08:52.065 --> 08:53.000
(Laughs)

08:53.066 --> 08:55.002
What? What's so funny?

08:55.068 --> 08:57.004
Speaking of
the eighth grade...

08:57.070 --> 08:59.006
Tripp wanted me to...

08:59.072 --> 09:02.009
Set up a lunch with you.

09:02.075 --> 09:03.977
Just him and me?

09:04.044 --> 09:05.045
Privately, yeah.

09:05.112 --> 09:08.949
Why would he want
to have a private lunch?

09:09.016 --> 09:10.984
Isn't it obvious?

09:11.051 --> 09:12.953
Oh, my God. That's...

09:13.020 --> 09:14.922
He's sweet,

09:14.988 --> 09:16.924
but I just don't see him
like that.

09:16.990 --> 09:19.026
(Mouths word)

09:19.092 --> 09:22.095
It's a good day
all around, huh?

09:24.097 --> 09:26.033
Okay. How about this?

09:26.099 --> 09:28.001
Okay, what?

09:28.068 --> 09:31.972
To solve everyone's problems,
why don't you bring me?
To the wedding?

09:32.039 --> 09:33.006
Uh-huh.

09:33.073 --> 09:35.008
I don't know.
What about Tripp?

09:35.075 --> 09:37.945
I'll talk to him
at the wedding,

09:38.011 --> 09:40.013
make my feelings clear.

09:40.080 --> 09:43.016
Come on. You and me together,
you know we'll have fun.

09:43.083 --> 09:47.020
Even the family lawyer
can't deny that.

09:47.087 --> 09:49.990
All right.
You got me. Let's do it.

09:50.057 --> 09:51.959
Okay.

09:52.025 --> 09:53.994
(Siren wails)
I'll be blunt.

09:54.061 --> 09:55.929
The news isn't good.

09:55.996 --> 09:58.999
Your body isn't responding
as we'd hoped.

09:59.066 --> 10:02.002
Why don't you just say
what you friggin' mean?
Brian.

10:02.069 --> 10:04.037
The cancer has spread...

10:04.104 --> 10:05.973
Considerably.

10:06.039 --> 10:08.041
I'm sorry.

10:08.108 --> 10:09.977
That can't be right,

10:10.043 --> 10:12.946
because she's feeling better,
she has a lot of energy and...

10:13.013 --> 10:14.948
So just run the labs again.

10:15.015 --> 10:18.018
One of the risks of this drug is
that it can mask the symptoms.

10:18.085 --> 10:20.921
Kind of a blessing
in a way.
Then put her
on something else.

10:20.988 --> 10:24.057
No.
What do you mean, no?
Just put her on something else!

10:24.124 --> 10:26.059
No, Brian.

10:26.126 --> 10:27.995
I'm done.

10:28.061 --> 10:30.030
Why don't you two
take your time

10:30.097 --> 10:32.099
and talk it over?

10:36.036 --> 10:37.037
(Door opens)

10:37.104 --> 10:38.972
Andrea...

10:39.039 --> 10:40.941
(Door closes)
You have to.

10:41.008 --> 10:44.011
I don't
have to do anything.

10:44.077 --> 10:46.947
All I wanted

10:47.014 --> 10:49.983
was to live my life
as peacefully as possible

10:50.050 --> 10:53.020
for the rest of my time...

10:55.055 --> 10:57.024
However long I have.

10:57.090 --> 10:59.026
And you talked me into this.

10:59.092 --> 11:03.964
I did it. I'm glad.

11:04.031 --> 11:06.033
And it's over.

11:08.001 --> 11:12.005
What are we gonna tell
the shrimp?

11:18.045 --> 11:19.980
I don't know.

11:20.047 --> 11:22.015
(Patrick) I must say,
I'm a bit surprised.

11:22.082 --> 11:24.952
You want a job...
In this office?

11:25.018 --> 11:26.019
Certified.

11:26.086 --> 11:28.021
Whatever happened to you
being a valet?

11:28.088 --> 11:30.023
I got
the public service bug.

11:30.090 --> 11:33.026
Your campaign was
a watershed moment for me.

11:33.093 --> 11:35.028
You know, it made me realize
that I have one life,

11:35.095 --> 11:37.030
and I gotta find
a better way to spend it.

11:37.097 --> 11:39.032
You don't really want
a job here.

11:39.099 --> 11:40.968
I do.

11:41.034 --> 11:43.003
Dude, I crave employment.

11:43.070 --> 11:46.940
No. You just want to be
closer to her.

11:47.007 --> 11:49.009
Nola? (Chuckles)

11:49.076 --> 11:50.978
Survey says...
(Imitates buzzer)

11:51.044 --> 11:53.947
She is Miles behind me,
light-years.

11:54.014 --> 11:55.048
You're sure about that?

11:55.115 --> 11:57.951
Look... I just want
to do my part

11:58.018 --> 12:01.021
to make New York
and America

12:01.088 --> 12:03.991
a little bit cooler
for everyone.

12:04.057 --> 12:06.026
I'd like to think
you really mean that.

12:06.093 --> 12:08.095
Dude, I'm your man.

12:12.132 --> 12:16.003
How is our patient,
wrenn, feeling?

12:16.069 --> 12:18.972
She's coming along.
Well, that's good.

12:19.039 --> 12:21.942
Did you make the arrangements
for our luncheon?

12:22.009 --> 12:23.944
No, not yet.

12:24.011 --> 12:25.946
Oh, get it done, will you?

12:26.013 --> 12:27.948
I really need
that little diversion

12:28.015 --> 12:32.019
to take my mind off this...
Damnable wedding.

12:32.085 --> 12:35.022
Why don't we ask wrenn
to come to the wedding?

12:35.088 --> 12:37.024
That--that would please me.

12:37.090 --> 12:38.992
Well, she's already coming.

12:39.059 --> 12:41.028
Really?

12:41.094 --> 12:43.931
I'm bringing her
as my date.

12:43.997 --> 12:45.966
As your date?
Yeah.

12:46.033 --> 12:47.034
Oh, I-I didn't realize

12:47.100 --> 12:49.036
the two of you had become
fast friends.

12:49.102 --> 12:52.039
Well, it's basically just that
at this point--friends. I...

12:52.105 --> 12:54.041
Which is why I didn't--
I didn't tell you earlier,

12:54.107 --> 12:55.976
because--

12:56.043 --> 12:59.012
well... I-I made it clear,
didn't I?

12:59.079 --> 13:02.049
Oh, yeah... you did.

13:02.115 --> 13:05.052
I-I just... you know,
I mean, you know...

13:05.118 --> 13:07.054
Okay. No, fine. Good.

13:07.120 --> 13:09.022
Tripp...
It's all right, Nick.

13:09.089 --> 13:12.025
Actually, it's for the best.

13:12.092 --> 13:14.027
There's my baby.

13:14.094 --> 13:17.931
Just a silly daydream gone.

13:17.998 --> 13:18.999
Hi, daddy.

13:19.066 --> 13:20.934
Hello, sweetheart.

13:21.001 --> 13:22.002
Nick.
Hey.

13:22.069 --> 13:24.004
See you at the wedding?
Yeah.

13:24.071 --> 13:27.007
Okay. Oh, and hey, don't worry.
I didn't put Lisa at your table.

13:27.074 --> 13:29.943
I figured sitting next to
your wife and her date

13:30.010 --> 13:31.945
could get kind of...
(Singsong voice) Awkward.

13:32.012 --> 13:33.981
(Normal voice) So...
Well, that's very thoughtful
of you.

13:34.047 --> 13:36.950
If you'll excuse me.

13:37.017 --> 13:37.985
Daddy.

13:38.051 --> 13:40.988
Sit down, sweetheart.

13:41.054 --> 13:43.991
I just want to say thank you

13:44.057 --> 13:46.026
for letting me
have the wedding here.

13:46.093 --> 13:49.963
I mean, I know there's--
there's still a part of you

13:50.030 --> 13:51.965
that doesn't trust Simon.

13:52.032 --> 13:53.967
A part of me?

13:54.034 --> 13:57.004
He makes me feel safe,
daddy.

13:59.006 --> 14:00.040
Look, I don't expect you

14:00.107 --> 14:03.043
to be completely happy
about this right now, okay?

14:03.110 --> 14:06.013
Or, well, okay, ever.

14:06.079 --> 14:09.983
But I love him, daddy.

14:10.050 --> 14:12.986
And in the way that you've
always wanted for me,

14:13.053 --> 14:16.023
he loves me, too.
He does.

14:16.089 --> 14:17.958
He does?

14:18.025 --> 14:19.092
He does.

14:22.062 --> 14:24.998
Well...

14:25.065 --> 14:27.935
I'll do my best, Darling.

14:28.001 --> 14:29.102
Thank you, daddy.

14:32.072 --> 14:35.042
(Cell phone rings)

14:35.108 --> 14:39.012
(Ring)

14:39.079 --> 14:40.948
(Ring)

14:41.014 --> 14:42.015
(Beep)

14:42.082 --> 14:43.016
Hello.

14:43.083 --> 14:44.985
It's Tripp.

14:45.052 --> 14:49.957
I want you to go see
Simon elder.

14:50.023 --> 14:52.092
And do what?

14:55.062 --> 14:56.997
Tell him he has a deal.

14:57.064 --> 15:01.001
(Exhales deeply)

15:08.108 --> 15:09.977
Nick.

15:10.043 --> 15:12.012
Come on in.

15:15.082 --> 15:17.985
What do you want?

15:18.051 --> 15:19.953
You've got a deal.

15:20.020 --> 15:23.957
Ah, and what deal
do I have exactly?

15:24.024 --> 15:25.993
Tripp is prepared
to sell you

15:26.059 --> 15:27.995
his controlling stake
in Darling enterprises

15:28.061 --> 15:30.030
in exchange
for calling off the wedding.

15:30.097 --> 15:32.933
Huh.

15:33.000 --> 15:35.035
The old man
saw the wisdom.

15:35.102 --> 15:39.039
I'm almost impressed.

15:41.041 --> 15:43.010
All right.
I'll call it off.

15:43.076 --> 15:44.945
Good.

15:45.012 --> 15:48.015
As soon as Tripp transfers
his shares into my account.
Wait a second.

15:48.081 --> 15:51.018
Clearly, a deal like this will
take days to complete, weeks.

15:51.084 --> 15:52.953
The ceremony's in four hours.

15:53.020 --> 15:54.955
Wow. Is it that soon?

15:55.022 --> 15:56.957
I gotta start getting dressed.

15:57.024 --> 15:58.959
Come on, Nick.
You didn't think

15:59.026 --> 16:01.028
I was gonna leave Karen Darling
at the altar,

16:01.094 --> 16:03.997
break her little heart in two

16:04.064 --> 16:07.000
just because you walked in here
and shook my hand?

16:07.067 --> 16:09.002
Listen, you work fast,

16:09.069 --> 16:11.939
because until this deal
is done,

16:12.005 --> 16:14.942
until Darling enterprises
is mine,

16:15.008 --> 16:17.010
the wedding's on.

16:25.986 --> 16:27.955
Are you lost?

16:28.021 --> 16:29.022
Baby, I'm working.

16:29.089 --> 16:32.025
Like you, I is now
on the federal dime.

16:32.092 --> 16:33.994
Speak English.

16:34.061 --> 16:35.929
I'm the senator's

16:35.996 --> 16:37.030
new general-assignment
office assistant,

16:37.097 --> 16:38.966
salary grade gs-1.

16:39.032 --> 16:41.001
I took your advice.

16:41.068 --> 16:43.971
Found a better way
to spend my life.

16:44.037 --> 16:46.006
I won't do "Charlie rose" again.
Oh, no, no, no.

16:46.073 --> 16:48.942
He dazzles you
with that Carolina charm.

16:49.009 --> 16:50.944
The next thing you know,
you're talking about

16:51.011 --> 16:53.013
how you used to walk around
in your mommy's high heels.

16:53.080 --> 16:55.949
(Laughs)

16:56.016 --> 16:57.951
Um, nola, any suggestions

16:58.018 --> 17:00.020
for how to get O'Connell
back to the table

17:00.087 --> 17:03.056
before we lose another
100,000 jobs to California?

17:03.123 --> 17:05.025
Get a new father.

17:05.092 --> 17:08.929
(Pencil sharpener whirring)

17:08.996 --> 17:10.063
(Whirring stops)

17:13.099 --> 17:16.002
I have--I have an idea.

17:16.069 --> 17:19.039
No, you don't.
Patrick, a word.

17:21.008 --> 17:23.977
Does the name Billy Carter
mean anything to you?

17:24.044 --> 17:25.012
Roger Clinton?

17:25.078 --> 17:27.013
Your brother
is a piece of baggage

17:27.079 --> 17:29.983
you cannot take
on this trip to Washington.

17:30.050 --> 17:32.986
He just needs
some direction in life.
Okay, the only direction
he needs is out the door.

17:33.053 --> 17:35.923
Jeremy shows up
drunk and disorderly

17:35.989 --> 17:37.024
in the tabloids every week.

17:37.090 --> 17:39.026
His taste in women
runs the gamut

17:39.092 --> 17:41.962
from eurotrash b-listers
to anorexic pop stars--
to you.

17:42.029 --> 17:44.932
I was the exception
that proves the rule.

17:44.998 --> 17:47.968
Listen, we need you
to be taken seriously,

17:48.035 --> 17:49.036
and pork barreling
your brother

17:49.102 --> 17:51.972
before you've even
taken the oath is just silly.

17:52.039 --> 17:54.007
Nola,
it's only his first day.

17:54.074 --> 17:56.009
Patrick, I'll make it
easy for you.

17:56.076 --> 17:59.046
It's Jeremy or me.
Your choice.

18:02.082 --> 18:04.017
(Sighs) A-all right,
all right.

18:04.084 --> 18:06.920
I'll... I'll fire him.

18:06.987 --> 18:08.088
Great.

18:12.125 --> 18:15.062
Well, that's an interesting
wardrobe choice. (Chuckles)

18:15.128 --> 18:18.065
Oh, yeah. I'm changing
at the imperial.

18:18.131 --> 18:20.067
Unless you want me
like this.

18:20.133 --> 18:22.970
Mnh-mnh.
Oh. (Chuckles)

18:23.036 --> 18:24.037
(Computer chimes)

18:24.104 --> 18:26.039
Uh, excuse me.
I've gotta get that.

18:26.106 --> 18:27.975
Let me check it.

18:28.041 --> 18:29.977
You're working
on our wedding day?

18:30.043 --> 18:31.979
Romantic.

18:32.045 --> 18:34.982
It'll just take a second.

18:35.048 --> 18:36.116
(Beep)

18:44.024 --> 18:46.026
Is everything okay?

18:46.093 --> 18:48.061
Huh.

18:50.998 --> 18:53.000
Is the world still safe
for billionaires?

18:55.002 --> 18:56.103
Yeah.

18:59.106 --> 19:01.008
No complaints.

19:01.074 --> 19:03.043
Okay.

19:13.987 --> 19:16.990
You... are beautiful.

19:17.057 --> 19:19.026
Oh.

19:21.028 --> 19:22.062
And I love you.

19:22.129 --> 19:26.033
And I can't...

19:29.036 --> 19:31.038
I can't wait
to be your husband.

19:31.104 --> 19:35.008
Well, you don't have to wait
much longer.

19:37.044 --> 19:38.979
I gotta head over.
Mnh-mnh.

19:39.046 --> 19:41.048
I gotta go. (Chuckles)

19:45.052 --> 19:45.986
Mm. Mm.

19:46.053 --> 19:48.021
Mm. (Chuckles)

19:48.088 --> 19:50.958
I'll see you
in a couple of hours.

19:51.024 --> 19:53.927
You know you will.

19:53.994 --> 19:55.996
The bank called.
The deal's done.

19:56.063 --> 19:58.031
It'll hit the wires
any minute.

19:58.098 --> 20:00.968
Good. Well, we better start
making calls.

20:01.034 --> 20:03.937
People are waiting
to hear from us.
Right.

20:04.004 --> 20:06.940
If my observation
of the man is correct,

20:07.007 --> 20:09.977
Mr. elder will not have
the guts to tell Karen,

20:10.043 --> 20:12.946
so I guess
it'll be down to me.

20:13.013 --> 20:16.016
If it's all right with you,
I'll tell her.

20:18.051 --> 20:19.052
Okay.

20:19.119 --> 20:22.055
Thanks, Nick.

20:28.061 --> 20:29.930
Oh, hey, Nick. (Chuckles)

20:29.997 --> 20:32.933
It's not a good time.
I'm kinda gettin' married here.

20:33.000 --> 20:33.967
(Laughs)

20:34.034 --> 20:35.035
Um...

20:35.102 --> 20:37.037
Karen, can we talk?

20:37.104 --> 20:38.972
Yeah.

20:39.039 --> 20:40.941
Alone.

20:41.008 --> 20:43.043
Oh. Okay, girls.

20:43.110 --> 20:45.045
(Whistles)

20:46.113 --> 20:48.015
(Giggles) Hey.

20:48.081 --> 20:49.983
Hey.

20:50.050 --> 20:51.985
What's cookin'?
(Laughs) Sorry.

20:52.052 --> 20:53.921
(Sighs)

20:53.987 --> 20:57.024
I think you might want
to sit back down.

20:57.090 --> 20:58.959
Okay, Nick, you know,

20:59.026 --> 21:01.962
I've--I've played this scene
in my head a million times,

21:02.029 --> 21:04.965
of you coming in here
and talking to me,

21:05.032 --> 21:08.035
and you telling me that you're
gonna whisk me off to some--

21:08.101 --> 21:10.037
I don't know--
this is not that scene.

21:10.103 --> 21:12.039
I know.

21:12.105 --> 21:14.975
I wish it were,
but it's not.

21:15.042 --> 21:17.945
Okay, so what's the matter?

21:18.011 --> 21:20.047
You're not getting married
to Simon today.

21:20.113 --> 21:22.983
(Chuckles)

21:23.050 --> 21:26.019
(Laughs)

21:26.086 --> 21:29.022
That's...

21:31.091 --> 21:34.995
Are... are you s-sure you're
not whisking me away here?

21:35.062 --> 21:38.999
I'm not.
Because that would be...
Better.

21:39.066 --> 21:41.034
I'm not.

21:44.004 --> 21:45.072
What happened?

21:48.075 --> 21:50.944
Simon offered
to call off the wedding

21:51.011 --> 21:52.946
in exchange
for majority control

21:53.013 --> 21:55.015
of Darling enterprises.

21:55.082 --> 21:56.917
(Scoffs)

21:56.984 --> 21:59.086
And your father
took him up on it.

22:02.055 --> 22:02.990
Wow.

22:03.056 --> 22:03.991
Yeah.

22:04.057 --> 22:05.926
I'm sorry.

22:05.993 --> 22:07.027
Don't be sorry.

22:07.094 --> 22:08.996
What g-- (Laughs)

22:09.062 --> 22:10.998
What girl
wouldn't be thrilled to know

22:11.064 --> 22:13.000
she's worth 20--
$20 billion?

22:13.066 --> 22:14.968
That's a lot--
more.

22:15.035 --> 22:16.103
Yeah.

22:23.110 --> 22:24.044
Nick.

22:24.111 --> 22:25.946
Yeah.

22:26.013 --> 22:29.116
You didn't have anything
to do with this, did you?

22:34.054 --> 22:36.023
(Sighs)

22:36.089 --> 22:37.991
Get out.
Karen--

22:38.058 --> 22:40.961
get out!

22:57.044 --> 23:00.013
(Woman) ♪ gypsy like me ♪

23:00.080 --> 23:03.050
Pillowhead! My man.

23:03.116 --> 23:04.051
(Laughs)

23:04.117 --> 23:06.987
Jeremy Darling in a suit.

23:07.054 --> 23:09.056
Oh, what's up?
(Chuckles)

23:09.122 --> 23:11.959
What's up?
What the hell
are you doing here?

23:12.025 --> 23:14.995
It's a little
on the early side.
Well, I'm kinda on a sched.

23:15.062 --> 23:18.932
I gotta get to my big sister's
fifth wedding.
What do you need, tunes?

23:18.999 --> 23:22.035
We need to talk,
my brother.
Well, all right.
What can I do for you?

23:22.102 --> 23:26.039
Well, it's more what can we
do for each other?

23:30.010 --> 23:31.011
(Blows air)

23:31.078 --> 23:32.980
You shouldn't play
with fire.

23:33.046 --> 23:35.983
Who the hell are you,
smokey the bear?

23:36.049 --> 23:39.019
It makes the Polish softer.

23:43.056 --> 23:45.993
Hey, I'm just kidding.

23:46.059 --> 23:49.096
You can be smokey the bear
if you want.

23:52.099 --> 23:56.003
Hey, what's the matter?

23:59.006 --> 24:01.975
Is mommy going to die?

24:02.042 --> 24:03.977
Why would you say that?

24:04.044 --> 24:06.046
Because she's sick.

24:06.113 --> 24:09.016
Who told you that?

24:09.082 --> 24:10.984
I listened on the phone

24:11.051 --> 24:12.986
when she was talking
to the doctor.

24:13.053 --> 24:16.023
Well, that's what you get
for eavesdropping, rumsfeld--

24:16.089 --> 24:18.992
inaccurate information.

24:19.059 --> 24:22.062
But she is sick.

24:25.032 --> 24:27.000
Yeah.

24:27.067 --> 24:29.069
She's sick.

24:31.071 --> 24:33.040
But she's not gonna die.

24:33.106 --> 24:34.975
You're lying.

24:35.042 --> 24:38.011
Hey, have I ever
lied to you?
Yes.

24:38.078 --> 24:40.981
Listen to me.
Mommy is not gonna die.

24:41.048 --> 24:42.049
You understand?

24:42.115 --> 24:46.019
Everything's gonna be
just fine.

24:55.062 --> 24:59.066
(Indistinct conversations)

25:08.008 --> 25:09.009
Wow.

25:09.076 --> 25:10.978
You look hot.

25:11.044 --> 25:13.649
Jeremy, I am here
to make my husband jealous,

25:13.716 --> 25:15.584
not to get you aroused.

25:15.651 --> 25:16.652
Got it?

25:16.719 --> 25:18.587
Got it.

25:18.654 --> 25:21.624
Good. And thank you.

25:21.690 --> 25:25.628
(Indistinct conversations)

25:25.694 --> 25:28.564
Thanks again
for coming with me.

25:28.631 --> 25:30.599
Happy to,
if for no other reason

25:30.666 --> 25:32.568
than to witness

25:32.635 --> 25:34.703
the removal of your brother
as hanger-on in chief.

25:34.770 --> 25:37.640
Great shoes, by the way.
Piece of advice, senator.

25:37.706 --> 25:39.575
When we get to D. C...

25:39.642 --> 25:42.678
(Whispers)
Don't mention women's shoes.

25:44.747 --> 25:47.650
How could you promise him
I was gonna be okay?

25:47.716 --> 25:51.620
I just wanted him
to feel safe.
Great. Now when I die,

25:51.687 --> 25:54.657
he'll feel even more unsafe
and know that his dad is a liar.

25:54.723 --> 25:57.660
Look, you are not gonna die.
Yes, I am.

25:57.726 --> 26:00.629
Grow up and accept it.

26:00.696 --> 26:02.665
No.

26:02.731 --> 26:05.634
You can't die.

26:05.701 --> 26:07.670
I need you.

26:07.736 --> 26:09.672
I love you.

26:09.738 --> 26:13.642
Wow. You love me?

26:13.709 --> 26:17.680
You'll do anything...
To win an argument.

26:17.746 --> 26:20.749
(Indistinct conversations)

26:24.753 --> 26:26.755
Good afternoon.

26:28.724 --> 26:30.659
If you'll all excuse me,

26:30.726 --> 26:33.562
I am sorry to be the bearer
of bad news,

26:33.629 --> 26:35.664
but the schedule has changed,

26:35.731 --> 26:39.635
and there will no longer be
a wedding today.

26:39.702 --> 26:42.671
On behalf
of the bride and groom,

26:42.738 --> 26:45.608
I apologize.

26:45.674 --> 26:47.610
Uh, wait a second.

26:47.676 --> 26:50.613
Yes, there is.

26:50.679 --> 26:54.583
(Guests murmuring)

26:54.650 --> 26:56.652
What are you doing?

26:56.719 --> 26:58.621
Andrea...

26:58.687 --> 27:00.589
Get up.

27:00.656 --> 27:02.591
No.

27:02.658 --> 27:04.660
Listen...
Ever since I met you...

27:04.727 --> 27:08.597
I've felt drawn to you,

27:08.664 --> 27:12.601
so much that it makes me
friggin' hate you sometimes...

27:12.668 --> 27:15.671
Because I don't like
needing anybody.

27:15.738 --> 27:17.673
But I do need you.

27:17.740 --> 27:21.577
I do.

27:21.644 --> 27:24.580
You're the mother
of my son...

27:24.647 --> 27:27.616
And I want you
to be my wife.

27:27.683 --> 27:30.719
(Murmuring continues)

27:32.655 --> 27:34.690
So what do you say?

27:37.626 --> 27:38.627
(Andrea) I do.

27:38.694 --> 27:41.597
Then by the power vested in me
by the state of New York,

27:41.664 --> 27:44.600
I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

27:44.667 --> 27:46.635
(Orchestra playing
Mendelssohn's "wedding march

27:46.702 --> 27:49.638
from
'a midsummer night's dream'")

27:49.705 --> 27:51.674
(Cheering)
Whoo!

27:51.740 --> 27:55.611
(Music continues)

27:55.678 --> 27:59.582
(Cheering continues)

27:59.648 --> 28:01.617
(Champagne cork pops)

28:01.684 --> 28:02.651
Tripp Darling got emotional,

28:02.718 --> 28:05.654
and emotion
is bad for business.

28:05.721 --> 28:07.590
Huh?

28:07.656 --> 28:09.625
(Speaks Russian)
We're in serious trouble,
Simon,

28:09.692 --> 28:11.627
and getting worse
by the minute.

28:11.694 --> 28:13.662
What are you talking about?

28:13.729 --> 28:15.664
Here.

28:15.731 --> 28:17.633
See for yourself.
(Tv clicks)

28:17.700 --> 28:20.636
Its been a roller-coaster day
for Darling enterprises.

28:20.703 --> 28:23.606
The blue chip surged
in early trading

28:23.672 --> 28:25.674
on news of a takeover
by billionaire Simon elder...
Yeah, so?

28:25.741 --> 28:28.644
Keep watching.
Then plummeted when dozens
of c. E. O. S announced

28:28.711 --> 28:31.647
they were canceling their
contracts with the company.

28:31.714 --> 28:33.582
One star research analyst

28:33.649 --> 28:35.584
has already published
a note to investors

28:35.651 --> 28:37.586
that she believes Simon elders
new company

28:37.653 --> 28:39.688
may face a serious liquidity
crisis in the coming weeks...
What the hell happened?

28:39.755 --> 28:42.591
He must have planned this
from the beginning.

28:42.658 --> 28:45.661
You're a losing
$100 million an hour, sir.

28:45.728 --> 28:48.597
...suddenly be forced to file
for bankruptcy protection?

28:48.664 --> 28:50.699
Is D.E. Stock now worthless?

28:50.766 --> 28:52.668
No word yet
from Simon elder...

28:52.735 --> 28:54.670
Shut it off.
As to how these developments

28:54.737 --> 28:56.672
are sitting
with the techno magnate.

28:56.739 --> 28:59.675
Well be bringing you
up-to-the-minute updates...
Shut it off!

28:59.742 --> 29:02.645
I'm trying, sir.
As the situation unfolds.
In other news, J--

29:02.711 --> 29:05.614
(gasps and murmurs)

29:05.681 --> 29:08.584
(Pants)

29:08.651 --> 29:10.686
Nobody leaves this room

29:10.753 --> 29:14.657
until we put this company
back together.

29:14.723 --> 29:17.660
(Scoffs)
What are you doing here?

29:17.726 --> 29:20.563
What, did--did you--
did you come to gloat?

29:20.629 --> 29:23.632
I guess this was all a part of
daddy's plan all along, right?

29:23.699 --> 29:25.634
(Laughs)
Well, congratulations.

29:25.701 --> 29:27.670
You can take the girl
out of the Darlings,

29:27.736 --> 29:30.639
but you can't take
the Darling out of the girl.

29:30.706 --> 29:33.609
How dare you
accuse me of anything.

29:33.676 --> 29:36.612
I gave myself to you
more fully and more freely

29:36.679 --> 29:40.583
than I've ever
given to anyone.

29:40.649 --> 29:43.686
And you traded me away for what,
for shares in a company?

29:43.752 --> 29:45.688
Hey, look on
the bright side.

29:45.754 --> 29:48.691
At least now
you're free for Nick.

29:48.757 --> 29:50.659
Oh, Simon.

29:50.726 --> 29:52.728
You don't get it,
do you?

29:54.730 --> 29:58.601
(Voice breaks)
All I wanted was you.

30:16.685 --> 30:18.554
(Playing instrumental jazz)

30:18.621 --> 30:20.656
You're quiet.
Are you okay?

30:20.723 --> 30:23.659
I'm happy.
It's unfamiliar.

30:23.726 --> 30:25.661
Mm.

30:27.663 --> 30:29.632
You're gonna have to
tell Brian the truth.

30:29.698 --> 30:32.601
We're only married 18 minutes,
you're already nagging me?

30:32.668 --> 30:33.669
(Chuckles)

30:33.736 --> 30:36.605
I don't think
I can do it.

30:36.672 --> 30:39.642
Which is exactly why
you have to.

30:39.708 --> 30:41.644
I'm dying, Brian.

30:41.710 --> 30:44.680
You have to learn
how to communicate with him,

30:44.747 --> 30:46.682
even when it's hard,

30:46.749 --> 30:51.620
especially when it's hard.

30:51.687 --> 30:53.622
Whoo!

30:53.689 --> 30:55.691
Let's just let him
enjoy today, okay?

30:55.758 --> 30:58.761
(Music continues)

31:00.729 --> 31:02.665
Jeremy, how's it going?

31:02.731 --> 31:05.668
Hey, what can I do
for you, chief?

31:05.734 --> 31:08.671
I am ready, willing
and able.

31:08.737 --> 31:10.639
About that. Uh...

31:10.706 --> 31:13.609
You okay?

31:13.676 --> 31:15.578
(Laughs)

31:15.644 --> 31:17.646
Jeremy, it's like this,

31:17.713 --> 31:20.616
and I really hate to have to
do this here, but--

31:20.683 --> 31:22.651
give that fella a medal.

31:22.718 --> 31:25.654
Mr. O'Connell,
what are you doing here?
Well, I said no
to you in person.

31:25.721 --> 31:29.625
Figured I oughta come back
to say yes.
Yes?

31:29.692 --> 31:32.628
Senator, I've decided
to accept your offer,

31:32.695 --> 31:35.564
and it was this young man
that got me to change my mind.

31:35.631 --> 31:36.665
J-Jeremy?
Yeah. (Laughs)

31:36.732 --> 31:38.634
Really?

31:38.701 --> 31:42.605
This is my son--
D. J. Pillowhead.

31:42.671 --> 31:46.642
What's up?
Mr. O'Connell.
What a surprise.

31:46.709 --> 31:47.676
Ms. lyons.

31:47.743 --> 31:50.646
Things have, uh,
been a little tough

31:50.713 --> 31:52.681
for me and my boy
ever since, uh,

31:52.748 --> 31:54.683
my marriage fell apart
with his mother.

31:54.750 --> 31:56.619
Fact of the matter is,

31:56.685 --> 31:59.622
we haven't talked to each other
for, uh, over a year.

31:59.688 --> 32:02.591
I advised my buddy
D. J. Over here

32:02.658 --> 32:04.693
to give his old man
a call... reconcile.

32:04.760 --> 32:07.696
My son and I still have
some work to do,

32:07.763 --> 32:10.633
but we're talking again.

32:10.699 --> 32:12.635
And you've got yourself
a deal.

32:12.701 --> 32:15.571
Well, wonderful.
Fantastic.

32:15.638 --> 32:17.673
Our staff will work out
the details.

32:17.740 --> 32:19.675
And thank you again,
young man.

32:19.742 --> 32:22.678
He's a keeper.

32:22.745 --> 32:25.681
A keeper.

32:25.748 --> 32:29.618
(Music continues)

32:29.685 --> 32:31.720
You look lovely.

32:33.756 --> 32:35.724
Thank you.

32:46.702 --> 32:48.671
You're here with Nick?

32:48.737 --> 32:50.639
I am, yeah.

32:50.706 --> 32:55.644
Well, I've... often said
on many occasions...

32:55.711 --> 32:59.615
Nick... is a lucky man.

32:59.682 --> 33:02.618
Actually, I think
I'm the lucky one.

33:02.685 --> 33:04.587
Well...

33:04.653 --> 33:07.656
Whatever comes of it,

33:07.723 --> 33:10.726
I couldn't be more thrilled
for the two of you.

33:12.695 --> 33:14.630
Truly.

33:14.697 --> 33:17.666
(Music continues)

33:18.734 --> 33:22.671
Well, I have to admit,
you throw a mean hail Mary.

33:22.738 --> 33:24.607
I had to.

33:24.673 --> 33:26.675
You were trying
to get me fired.

33:26.742 --> 33:29.578
Get you fired, Jeremy?

33:29.645 --> 33:31.614
You barely even
occur to me.

33:31.680 --> 33:33.649
(Patrick) Hello, team.

33:33.716 --> 33:36.585
Mind if I steal away
my chief of staff

33:36.652 --> 33:38.587
for a little spin
on the dance floor?

33:38.654 --> 33:40.656
She's all yours.

33:40.723 --> 33:43.626
See you in the office,
first thing Monday.

33:43.692 --> 33:45.594
We'll see about Tuesday.

33:45.661 --> 33:47.563
Dig it.

33:47.630 --> 33:49.632
So tell me,
what did Tripp have to say?

33:49.698 --> 33:51.634
He couldn't have been nicer.

33:51.700 --> 33:54.570
Why?

33:54.637 --> 33:56.605
No reason.

33:56.672 --> 33:59.642
What Nick sees in her,
I'll never know.

33:59.708 --> 34:02.711
(Wrenn laughs)

34:05.648 --> 34:09.685
I have something
to confess to you, my dear.

34:10.719 --> 34:12.655
What's that?

34:12.721 --> 34:14.657
Upon first meeting wrenn...

34:14.723 --> 34:18.627
Getting to know her
a little,

34:18.694 --> 34:21.664
I allowed myself to reflect,

34:21.730 --> 34:24.632
for the first time, really,
in our 40 years,

34:24.699 --> 34:29.605
on what my life might be like
with someone else.

34:29.672 --> 34:32.608
She could be
your granddaughter.

34:32.675 --> 34:34.643
(Laughs) I know. I know.
It's absurd.

34:34.710 --> 34:36.579
I even went so far

34:36.645 --> 34:38.681
as to ask Nick to arrange
a clandestine rendezvous,

34:38.746 --> 34:40.683
a luncheon.

34:40.748 --> 34:44.587
But it--that never
came to pass.

34:44.652 --> 34:47.656
But seeing her here
this evening

34:47.723 --> 34:52.594
put my escapade
into perspective.

34:52.661 --> 34:55.630
And I felt that
you should know that

34:55.697 --> 34:59.568
I discovered afresh...

34:59.635 --> 35:03.572
That you are
the love of my life,

35:03.639 --> 35:05.608
and you always will be.

35:05.674 --> 35:08.611
Thank you. Thank you.

35:08.677 --> 35:11.614
(Whispers) Thank you.

35:11.680 --> 35:12.681
Mr. Darling.

35:12.748 --> 35:14.617
Yes, Clark.

35:14.683 --> 35:16.652
Simon elder's here.

35:16.719 --> 35:19.622
He says it's urgent.

35:19.688 --> 35:21.624
You screwed me, old man.

35:21.690 --> 35:23.659
You sabotaged
Darling enterprises.

35:23.726 --> 35:26.662
Not at all.
Not at all.

35:26.729 --> 35:29.565
My friends, my colleagues,
are free to do business

35:29.632 --> 35:31.634
or to not do business
with whomever they please.

35:31.700 --> 35:33.636
But it is fascinating,
don't you find?

35:33.702 --> 35:36.605
To see people operating
on the basis of something

35:36.672 --> 35:39.608
other than the pursuit
of financial gain.

35:39.675 --> 35:42.578
The company is ruined--
ruined.

35:42.645 --> 35:45.581
Well, if you're
no longer interested

35:45.648 --> 35:47.583
in controlling
Darling enterprises,

35:47.650 --> 35:50.586
I will buy it back from you
at its current market value.

35:50.653 --> 35:52.588
You think I'm gonna
let you walk away

35:52.655 --> 35:54.623
with a 1-day,
$10-billion profit?

35:54.690 --> 35:55.758
(Chuckles)

35:57.726 --> 36:00.629
Okay, half the company...

36:00.696 --> 36:04.600
At a 20% discount
to yesterday's close.

36:04.667 --> 36:07.670
So that
that way it would only be...

36:07.736 --> 36:11.674
$4 billion and change.

36:11.740 --> 36:13.676
And what, you and I will...

36:13.742 --> 36:16.612
(Chuckles) Will be partners?

36:16.679 --> 36:17.680
(Laughs)

36:17.746 --> 36:19.615
Mm-hmm.

36:19.682 --> 36:22.618
Ironic, isn't it?

36:22.685 --> 36:25.621
What do you say?

36:25.688 --> 36:27.656
Deal?

36:38.734 --> 36:40.636
(Instrumental jazz playing)

36:40.703 --> 36:43.639
Wrenn,
you bony little tramp.

36:43.706 --> 36:46.675
Excuse me?
How dare you show up
at my daughter's wedding

36:46.742 --> 36:48.677
and throw yourself
at my husband,

36:48.744 --> 36:51.614
a man old enough to be--
I'm here with Nick.

36:51.680 --> 36:53.649
Do you honestly think
you're gonna steal my family...
No.

36:53.716 --> 36:55.684
My fortune?
No, I have no intention--

36:55.751 --> 36:57.686
you think I would
let that happen?

36:57.753 --> 37:00.623
Okay, I-I didn't mean
to hurt anyone.

37:00.689 --> 37:02.591
I know exactly
what you meant to do.

37:02.658 --> 37:05.661
You planted yourself
in front of my car,

37:05.728 --> 37:08.631
you insinuated yourself
into my household,

37:08.697 --> 37:12.601
and you had every intention
of stealing my husband from me,

37:12.668 --> 37:14.637
and with him, my future

37:14.703 --> 37:17.606
and the future of my family.

37:17.673 --> 37:18.674
(Mutters)

37:18.741 --> 37:22.678
Get the hell
out of my house.

37:22.745 --> 37:25.681
Now!

37:29.685 --> 37:31.654
Hey.

37:31.720 --> 37:34.657
Lost your date?

37:34.723 --> 37:38.627
Lisa, let's--
let's not do this here.

37:38.694 --> 37:40.563
(Chuckles)

37:40.629 --> 37:42.731
I was... really asking.

37:44.667 --> 37:45.734
Uh...

37:49.738 --> 37:51.674
Hey.

37:51.740 --> 37:53.676
Hey.

37:53.742 --> 37:56.645
Do you remember
the summer house?

37:56.712 --> 37:58.647
What, the one that you
and your family

37:58.714 --> 38:01.617
used to stay at when you
were growing up? Yeah.

38:01.684 --> 38:02.651
(Chuckles)

38:02.718 --> 38:05.588
I was just thinking
of this time in college

38:05.654 --> 38:08.591
when me and my roommate
drove all night to go there,

38:08.657 --> 38:10.593
and when we finally made it,

38:10.659 --> 38:13.629
it had been sold
and torn down.

38:13.696 --> 38:15.664
There was nothing left.

38:15.731 --> 38:18.634
That's how I feel
about us right now.

38:18.701 --> 38:21.637
You know...
We could drive all night

38:21.704 --> 38:23.672
and try
and get back what we had,

38:23.739 --> 38:25.608
but it's--it's gone.

38:25.674 --> 38:28.677
It's just... gone.

38:32.648 --> 38:35.584
When I saw you and wrenn
at the coffee shop,

38:35.651 --> 38:37.686
I was so jealous.

38:37.753 --> 38:40.589
(Sighs) So I
brought Jeremy tonight

38:40.656 --> 38:43.592
to make you jealous.

38:43.659 --> 38:45.594
But I don't
feel jealous anymore.

38:45.661 --> 38:47.630
I just feel...

38:47.696 --> 38:49.632
Sad.

38:51.700 --> 38:53.669
Yeah.

39:03.679 --> 39:06.715
It's fine.

39:11.687 --> 39:13.689
If you'll excuse me.

39:16.759 --> 39:19.695
(Sighs)

39:21.664 --> 39:22.665
(Elevator bell dings)

39:22.731 --> 39:24.600
Wrenn, wait a minute.

39:24.667 --> 39:27.570
No. I-I have to go.
Why, what happened?

39:27.636 --> 39:30.673
I-I don't know. I can't be here.
I can't be around these people.
Wait. Just tell me
what happened.

39:30.739 --> 39:32.608
I honestly don't know.

39:32.675 --> 39:35.611
One second, I'm talking
to Tripp about you.

39:35.678 --> 39:37.613
Next thing I know,
Letitia is accusing me

39:37.680 --> 39:39.682
of coming to the wedding
to steal her husband.

39:39.748 --> 39:42.651
You know, I made it
very clear to Tripp

39:42.718 --> 39:44.653
that it's you
I'm interested in.

39:44.720 --> 39:46.655
I mean, you're asking me
what happened.

39:46.722 --> 39:48.757
Why don't you tell me?

39:52.661 --> 39:54.597
You know what?

39:54.663 --> 39:57.700
This started
as an accident, and...

39:57.766 --> 40:02.638
Maybe it's best if we
just leave it at that.

40:02.705 --> 40:07.676
So... we're just done?

40:07.743 --> 40:10.613
Just like that?

40:10.679 --> 40:13.582
Listen, I would love
to get to know you better,

40:13.649 --> 40:15.618
really.

40:15.684 --> 40:18.621
But existing around this family
is... not easy.

40:18.687 --> 40:21.657
Trust me. I-I know.

40:21.724 --> 40:22.658
(Sighs)

40:22.725 --> 40:24.627
Go.

40:24.693 --> 40:28.664
And... don't look back.

40:38.707 --> 40:40.676
Tripp.

40:40.743 --> 40:43.746
We need to talk, now.

40:52.655 --> 40:53.656
What the hell is going on?

40:53.722 --> 40:55.658
Mr. elder has had

40:55.724 --> 40:58.594
a nasty case
of buyer's remorse.

40:58.661 --> 41:01.664
So we're going to bail him
out of his predicament.

41:01.730 --> 41:02.765
Congratulations.

41:04.767 --> 41:07.636
Did you enjoy owning
Darling enterprises

41:07.703 --> 41:10.606
for five hours?

41:10.673 --> 41:14.577
Oh, no, no. He's still going
to be a major shareholder.

41:14.643 --> 41:17.646
I control 50% of the company,
to be exact.

41:17.713 --> 41:19.682
What's going on, Tripp?

41:19.748 --> 41:23.586
Well, Mr. elder and I
have become partners.

41:23.652 --> 41:26.622
(Chuckles)
Which I-I guess also means

41:26.689 --> 41:28.624
that in addition
to working for me,

41:28.691 --> 41:32.595
you will also work for him.

41:32.661 --> 41:34.597
Well...

41:34.663 --> 41:36.699
Clearly this is
about me and wrenn.

41:36.765 --> 41:40.569
That's utter nonsense.
It wasn't enough for you
to blow up my chance

41:40.636 --> 41:42.571
at a relationship
with the woman?

41:42.638 --> 41:45.608
You're gonna make me
pay for it again?
Nick, your accusation
is incomprehensible.

41:45.674 --> 41:47.643
Fine.

41:49.678 --> 41:53.649
I'll see both of you
on Monday morning.

42:00.689 --> 42:02.625
(Door slams)

42:02.691 --> 42:04.627
(Elevator bell dings)

42:04.693 --> 42:06.695
(Doors open)

42:15.638 --> 42:18.641
Karen, I am so sorry.

42:22.745 --> 42:24.389
Go to hell.
