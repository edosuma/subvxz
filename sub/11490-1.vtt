00:04.730 --> 00:06.750
Look at him. He can type 80
words a minute with his thumb,

00:06.760 --> 00:09.840
but he can't pee without
hitting the shower curtain.

00:09.850 --> 00:14.510
Fortunately, typing is a
job skill and peeing is not.

00:15.150 --> 00:18.090
Oh, dude, WTF?

00:21.680 --> 00:23.540
- Oh, geez.
- What?

00:23.910 --> 00:26.860
That woman over there.
We used to go out.

00:28.440 --> 00:30.990
Did it not end well?

00:31.540 --> 00:34.070
It went fine for me.

00:34.080 --> 00:35.820
Although, in retrospect,

00:35.830 --> 00:40.190
I guess I could have handled our parting with a
little more tact and sensitivity and a little less,

00:40.200 --> 00:43.280
you know, banging her best friend.

00:43.290 --> 00:44.500
Oh, God!

00:44.510 --> 00:47.420
Hey, hey, her friend was a double-jointed
sex freak with daddy issues--

00:47.430 --> 00:49.420
what was I supposed to do?

00:49.430 --> 00:51.620
You're right. Your hands were tied.

00:51.630 --> 00:53.480
That, too.

00:53.950 --> 00:56.020
So, how long ago was this?

00:56.030 --> 00:58.850
Her or the friend? 'Cause
there was a brief overlap.

00:58.860 --> 01:00.690
Let's go with her.

01:00.700 --> 01:02.640
I don't know. Eight, nine years.

01:02.650 --> 01:05.069
So maybe she's over it.

01:12.970 --> 01:14.470
Or maybe not.

01:39.670 --> 01:41.010
t, here's the plan.

01:41.020 --> 01:42.020
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

01:42.030 --> 01:45.860
You count to ten, then scream like a girl
and start giving Jake the Heimlich maneuver.

01:46.320 --> 01:48.100
Don't be ridiculous.

01:48.110 --> 01:49.640
Charlie?

01:52.590 --> 01:56.640
Okay, but if she reaches into her purse,
I'm using numbnuts as a human shield.

01:57.370 --> 01:59.790
Hey, Chrissy. Long time.

01:59.800 --> 02:01.080
I know.

02:01.090 --> 02:04.040
Yep, long, long time.

02:04.050 --> 02:04.770
Yeah.

02:04.780 --> 02:07.810
Time is a great healer, isn't it?

02:07.820 --> 02:09.990
Of some things.

02:10.000 --> 02:12.260
Hey, congratulations on your new career.

02:12.270 --> 02:13.110
Thank you.

02:13.120 --> 02:17.330
It's hard to believe Charlie
Harper is a children's singing star.

02:17.340 --> 02:20.080
Well, you know how much I love kid...

02:20.090 --> 02:22.850
Yep, a long, long time.

02:24.350 --> 02:26.600
Looks like your little guy enjoys music.

02:26.610 --> 02:27.660
Oh, yeah, he loves it.

02:27.670 --> 02:29.940
He's actually quite
the piano player, too.

02:29.950 --> 02:32.830
Piano? You hear that, Charlie?

02:32.840 --> 02:35.360
The young man plays piano just like you.

02:35.370 --> 02:37.590
Lots of kids play piano.

02:37.600 --> 02:39.100
So, you still living in Westwood?

02:39.110 --> 02:40.100
Yeah. Still there.

02:40.110 --> 02:42.150
We just drove down to
spend the day at the beach.

02:42.160 --> 02:43.770
Oh, sure. The beach.

02:43.780 --> 02:46.660
Nice place to visit, but you
wouldn't want to live there.

02:46.670 --> 02:48.910
Actually, I do live
there; it's not that bad.

02:48.920 --> 02:52.040
Right. Well, we should get
going. It was nice seeing you.

02:52.050 --> 02:53.450
Nice to see you, too.

02:53.460 --> 02:55.700
Come on, Chuck.

03:00.080 --> 03:01.840
Chuck.

03:01.850 --> 03:03.490
I heard it.

03:03.500 --> 03:04.900
Lots of kids named Chuck.

03:04.910 --> 03:07.950
It's a nickname for Charles, isn't it?

03:07.960 --> 03:10.360
So are Chaz, Chad, Chick and
Charlie. What's your point?

03:10.370 --> 03:13.540
No point.It's just that you haven't
seen that woman in nine years,

03:13.550 --> 03:15.990
and little Chuck is, uh...

03:16.000 --> 03:18.720
Well, how old do you
suppose little Chuck is?

03:18.730 --> 03:20.310
What difference does it make?

03:20.320 --> 03:23.980
Well, I'd say little Chuck is, uh...

03:24.280 --> 03:29.090
seven or eight years old,
give or take nine months.

03:29.860 --> 03:30.860
What are you implying?

03:30.870 --> 03:32.090
'Cause I don't know what
you're talking about.

03:32.100 --> 03:33.100
You don't?

03:33.110 --> 03:35.210
Okay, I choose not to.

03:35.220 --> 03:36.950
JAKE: Oh, crap! Dad,
quick, we gotta go home!

03:36.960 --> 03:37.660
Why, what's wrong?

03:37.670 --> 03:39.860
My battery died.

03:39.870 --> 03:43.130
Oh, no, wait. I just
turned it off by accident.

03:43.820 --> 03:47.030
This wouldn't happen
if I had a smartphone.

03:47.560 --> 03:50.150
Do I even need to say it?

03:52.580 --> 03:55.940
So is it just me or did that kid
kind of look like Uncle Charlie?

04:09.610 --> 04:12.360
* And the silver spoon *

04:12.880 --> 04:15.860
* Little boy blue and
the man on the moon *

04:16.839 --> 04:17.920
Shut up, Alan.

04:17.930 --> 04:21.370
* When you coming home,
Dad? I don't know when...*

04:22.620 --> 04:23.900
It's not funny.

04:23.910 --> 04:28.080
Well, maybe not funny ha-ha,
but certainly funny hee-hee.

04:29.540 --> 04:31.460
That boy was nothing like me.

04:31.470 --> 04:35.430
Well, he didn't have ear hair and whiskey
breath, but I'm guessing he'll grow into that.

04:35.740 --> 04:36.800
What's going on?

04:36.810 --> 04:40.710
Well, it would appear that
the ol' spermonator here...

04:40.720 --> 04:42.210
has fathered a child.

04:42.220 --> 04:43.340
I did not.

04:43.360 --> 04:44.550
How can you be so sure?

04:44.560 --> 04:48.550
'Cause I never play in the rain
without a slicker and galoshes.

04:49.940 --> 04:52.750
I'm confused. Where do the galoshes go?

04:53.720 --> 04:55.770
It's just a figure of speech.

04:55.780 --> 05:00.500
Everything that needs to be covered is covered
when, you know, covering is appropriate.

05:00.760 --> 05:02.100
I didn't ask for your life story.

05:02.110 --> 05:04.900
I was just confused about the galoshes.

05:05.350 --> 05:08.360
You know, Charlie, even
condoms are only 98% effective.

05:08.370 --> 05:09.460
That's not true.

05:09.470 --> 05:11.620
The hell it isn't.

05:12.050 --> 05:13.310
Haven't you ever read the package?

05:13.320 --> 05:14.720
Who reads the package?

05:14.730 --> 05:17.210
It's not like a cereal box.

05:17.220 --> 05:19.720
You don't read it while you're eating.

05:20.900 --> 05:22.600
Yikes.

05:22.610 --> 05:23.960
Come on, Charlie, do the math.

05:23.970 --> 05:26.240
You haven't seen the woman in nine
years and she's got an eight-year-old.

05:26.250 --> 05:27.320
So what?

05:27.330 --> 05:31.060
You showed up at my door with a ten-year-old
and I hadn't seen you in 11 years.

05:32.000 --> 05:34.940
Does that mean taterhead
is our love child?

05:34.950 --> 05:36.400
All right, fine, stay in denial.

05:36.410 --> 05:38.140
There's no way little Chuck is your son.

05:38.160 --> 05:39.200
Chuck?

05:39.210 --> 05:44.660
Hey, hey, lots of kids are named Chuck,
play the piano and look disturbingly like me.

05:46.700 --> 05:48.410
He's right.

05:48.430 --> 05:51.430
In fact, I'm surprised we're
not up to our asses in 'em.

05:59.410 --> 06:00.300
Hey, Russell?

06:00.310 --> 06:02.130
I'm busy.

06:02.140 --> 06:03.900
I've got a question about these condoms.

06:03.910 --> 06:07.460
I told you, Charlie, I'm giving
you the best bulk rate I can.

06:08.310 --> 06:09.580
I know, but that's not what I was...

06:09.590 --> 06:12.340
There's just no way I can
compete with the big chain stores.

06:12.360 --> 06:12.940
I understand.

06:12.980 --> 06:15.430
So I make it up in personal service.

06:15.470 --> 06:16.240
I'm sure you do.

06:16.270 --> 06:19.450
I mean, I'm not going to unroll the
damn things and put 'em on for you,

06:19.460 --> 06:22.630
but short of that,I've got your back.

06:22.820 --> 06:24.450
And I appreciate it.

06:24.460 --> 06:25.970
But that's not what I was asking about.

06:25.980 --> 06:27.810
Charlie, times are tough.

06:27.830 --> 06:30.980
People don't get their drugs from their
friendly neighborhood pharmacist anymore.

06:31.010 --> 06:32.780
They go on the Internet.

06:32.810 --> 06:33.470
I know.

06:33.480 --> 06:38.400
Sure, trust your mailman with your
heart medicine and stool softeners.

06:38.410 --> 06:41.490
Russell, have you been
hittin' the free samples again?

06:41.500 --> 06:43.830
What are you, a cop?

06:43.840 --> 06:45.960
No, I'm just a little
concerned about you.

06:45.970 --> 06:48.700
Well, if you're so concerned,
help me out a little bit.

06:48.720 --> 06:52.810
Why don't you buy some reading glasses
or a neck brace once in a while.

06:52.840 --> 06:55.800
- Sure, whatever.
- A bag of Skittles for God's sake.

06:55.810 --> 06:59.710
You know, 'cause my margin
on condoms is bubkes.

07:00.550 --> 07:04.050
Yeah, well, speaking of condoms,

07:04.060 --> 07:08.020
I just want to know if somebody could get
pregnant even if you were wearing a condom.

07:08.030 --> 07:09.990
Have you been talking to
the Wetzel's Pretzels lady?

07:10.000 --> 07:13.380
Because I just gave her
a ride home, that's it.

07:13.390 --> 07:15.370
No, no, no, no, I mean in general.

07:15.380 --> 07:17.660
What are the odds that
a condom wouldn't work?

07:17.670 --> 07:20.990
Well, there are a number
of things to factor in.

07:23.940 --> 07:25.860
Oh, cough syrup?

07:25.870 --> 07:27.100
I don't have a cough.

07:27.120 --> 07:28.940
Neither do I.

07:31.580 --> 07:33.910
Anyway, condoms.

07:33.920 --> 07:36.000
Whenever you're dealing
with a manufactured product,

07:36.010 --> 07:38.480
there's always going to
be flaws in the process.

07:38.490 --> 07:42.130
Yeah, but aren't they supposed to
be tested before they go out? Or in?

07:42.790 --> 07:45.320
Well, sure, but they
don't test every one.

07:45.330 --> 07:46.220
They don't?

07:46.230 --> 07:49.170
Masturbating's looking
better and better, huh?

07:52.500 --> 07:56.330
Okay, okay, so bottom line, what you're
saying is even if I'm wearing a condom,

07:56.340 --> 07:59.440
there's a chance I could
get someone pregnant?

08:01.530 --> 08:04.280
Did you miss eighth grade
health class, Charlie?

08:04.310 --> 08:06.070
Oh, come on, who went to health class?

08:06.080 --> 08:09.240
Well, amongst others, a certain
self-medicating pharmacist

08:09.260 --> 08:11.400
who pays alimony to
three different women,

08:11.410 --> 08:14.700
but not one penny in child support.

08:15.720 --> 08:19.570
All right, all right, for future
reference, what about lambskin?

08:19.580 --> 08:21.020
Are they more effective?

08:21.030 --> 08:24.150
Well, um, less so than
your latex product.

08:24.160 --> 08:29.780
Now I had to stop wearing them myself because
something about the smell made my cat go berserk.

08:29.790 --> 08:31.990
It kind of a cute story.

08:32.000 --> 08:33.760
I don't... I don't want to hear it.

08:33.770 --> 08:36.090
Not a cat person, huh?

08:36.110 --> 08:39.020
I'm not either anymore.

08:40.470 --> 08:42.970
All right, well, thanks,
Russell. I'll see ya.

08:42.980 --> 08:44.350
Th-Th-That's
it?

08:44.360 --> 08:47.060
You're not going to buy anything?
We've got Wiffle ball bats.

08:47.070 --> 08:50.630
Maybe your little bastard
would like a Wiffle ball bat.

08:52.560 --> 08:54.880
Childproof.

09:04.150 --> 09:06.200
You all right?

09:06.210 --> 09:08.020
No, I am not.

09:08.030 --> 09:10.340
What's going on?

09:10.710 --> 09:15.960
Alan, I have always conducted my sex
life according to three simple principles.

09:15.970 --> 09:19.940
One: if at all possible, ladies first.

09:21.060 --> 09:24.910
Two: it's easier to be
forgiven than ask permission.

09:26.780 --> 09:29.190
And third, and most important:

09:29.200 --> 09:35.200
the ten seconds it takes to put on a condom beats the hell
out of the ten years you have to pretend to like soccer.

09:36.300 --> 09:37.960
Except when they don't work.

09:37.980 --> 09:42.590
Stupid tiny disclaimer
on the side of the box.

09:42.600 --> 09:46.640
They should put it in big letters
right on the reservoir tip.

09:46.650 --> 09:49.410
Do you feel lucky, dumb ass?

09:49.420 --> 09:51.330
Yeah, that'd do it.

09:51.340 --> 09:53.780
So, what's your next move?

09:53.790 --> 09:58.100
Well, you'd think if Chrissy had
my child and decided not to tell me,

09:58.110 --> 09:59.900
I'd just send her a little card.

09:59.910 --> 10:02.750
You know, "Thanks for being
a good sport" or something.

10:02.770 --> 10:05.960
I'm not sure Hallmark has
a deadbeat dad section.

10:05.990 --> 10:07.160
It doesn't matter.

10:07.170 --> 10:10.020
For some reason, I
want to know the truth.

10:10.030 --> 10:12.010
If I have a kid, I
need to know about it.

10:12.020 --> 10:13.050
Of course you do.

10:13.060 --> 10:16.070
Being a father is the
greatest joy there is.

10:16.080 --> 10:19.130
Hey, Dad, where's the plunger?

10:19.140 --> 10:20.770
Uh, laundry room.

10:20.780 --> 10:23.500
Thanks, I over-wiped.

10:25.730 --> 10:28.360
No such thing, my son.

10:29.100 --> 10:30.260
Where was I?

10:30.270 --> 10:31.910
The joys of fatherhood.

10:31.920 --> 10:33.990
Right.

10:35.210 --> 10:38.410
What? There was a time
when he didn't wipe at all.

10:39.860 --> 10:42.910
Hey, I'm gonna need a mop, too.

10:42.920 --> 10:46.500
Excuse me. Father/son moment.

10:57.610 --> 11:01.060
* People, let me tell
you about my best friend *

11:01.070 --> 11:05.620
* He's a warmhearted person
Who'd love me till the end *

11:05.630 --> 11:09.190
* People, let me tell
you about my best friend *

11:09.200 --> 11:13.750
* He's one boy cuddly toy My
up, my down, my pride and joy *

11:13.760 --> 11:17.400
* People, let me tell you
about him, he's so much fun *

11:17.410 --> 11:19.290
* Whether we're
talking man-to-man *

11:19.300 --> 11:21.320
* Or whether we're
talking son-to-son *

11:21.330 --> 11:25.020
* 'Cause he's my best friend *

11:25.530 --> 11:29.430
* Yeah, he's my best friend...*

11:47.150 --> 11:49.600
Daddy's home!

11:56.410 --> 11:58.550
Hurry! Hurry!

12:07.840 --> 12:08.800
Hey, Jake?

12:08.810 --> 12:10.800
Don't worry. It's all cleaned up.

12:10.810 --> 12:12.040
Not why I'm here.

12:12.080 --> 12:14.740
You can hardly smell it at all anymore.

12:14.750 --> 12:16.580
Don't kid yourself.

12:16.590 --> 12:18.910
Although I may owe you a toilet.

12:18.920 --> 12:21.230
I'll put it on your tab.

12:21.540 --> 12:23.490
Now, I want to ask you a question.

12:23.510 --> 12:26.780
Crumb cake, a frappuccino
and a burrito supreme.

12:26.790 --> 12:28.200
That's not the question.

12:28.210 --> 12:31.550
Oh, yeah, and a tangerine.
That's what killed me.

12:33.050 --> 12:33.960
Are you done?

12:33.980 --> 12:36.840
I hope so, 'cause the
toilet won't flush anymore.

12:39.370 --> 12:43.470
What-What I wanted to ask you is do
you think I've been a good role model?

12:43.480 --> 12:44.220
Are you kidding?

12:44.250 --> 12:48.390
You drink, you gamble, you have different
women here practically every night.

12:48.400 --> 12:51.230
You're the best role
model a guy could want.

12:51.630 --> 12:52.580
You think so?

12:52.590 --> 12:55.390
Yeah, they should put
your face on money.

12:56.340 --> 12:57.390
Well, thanks, buddy.

12:57.400 --> 12:58.810
I appreciate it.

12:58.820 --> 13:01.110
Oh, hey, one more question.

13:01.120 --> 13:02.850
How would you feel
about having a cousin?

13:02.860 --> 13:04.160
I've got a cousin.

13:04.180 --> 13:05.750
I mean, another cousin.

13:05.770 --> 13:08.210
What do I need another cousin for?

13:08.230 --> 13:10.060
Forget it.

13:10.070 --> 13:13.220
What I need is a
smartphone and a new toilet.

13:15.220 --> 13:17.210
Cousin.

13:37.180 --> 13:38.950
Charlie.

13:39.280 --> 13:40.860
What are you doing here?

13:40.870 --> 13:41.930
Well, I was in the neighborhood.

13:41.940 --> 13:46.160
I thought I'd stop by and
say hello and bring you this.

13:47.910 --> 13:49.410
A Wiffle ball bat.

13:49.420 --> 13:50.840
That's for Chuck.

13:50.850 --> 13:54.730
I got you an eyeglass repair
kit and some malted milk balls.

13:56.370 --> 13:57.610
Thanks.

13:57.630 --> 14:01.900
I know it's not much of a gift, but the guy
that usually sells roses at the freeway on-ramp,

14:01.910 --> 14:04.550
well, he switched to oranges, and
I didn't know if you liked oranges.

14:04.560 --> 14:07.540
So anyway, is Chuck my kid?

14:08.230 --> 14:09.380
What difference does it make?

14:09.410 --> 14:10.850
Well, it makes all the
difference in the world.

14:10.870 --> 14:11.840
How?

14:11.850 --> 14:16.520
Well, for starters, I'm gonna write a scathing
letter to a certain manufacturer of latex products.

14:18.660 --> 14:22.390
But more importantly, if
I'm his dad, he should know.

14:22.400 --> 14:23.790
He's already got a dad.

14:23.820 --> 14:25.760
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

14:25.770 --> 14:29.060
We may not live together anymore and
he may not have your kind of money,

14:29.070 --> 14:33.150
but he's a good dad, and
he loves Chuck very much.

14:33.160 --> 14:35.690
So you're just raising him on your own?

14:35.700 --> 14:37.950
Charlie, you don't
have to worry about him.

14:37.960 --> 14:40.890
He's gotten along just fine without you
for the last eight years and so have I.

14:40.900 --> 14:43.310
But wait, Chrissy!

14:44.990 --> 14:47.480
I didn't know!

14:52.300 --> 14:55.540
Boy, you miss one health class.

14:59.180 --> 15:03.470
So, Jake, how do you like high school?

15:03.480 --> 15:05.590
I'm in eight grade.

15:05.610 --> 15:07.910
I see.

15:08.360 --> 15:10.240
When do you start high school?

15:10.250 --> 15:13.330
Hard to say. Eighth grade
is really kicking my ass.

15:13.340 --> 15:14.350
Jake, language.

15:14.360 --> 15:20.250
Yeah, language, math,
science, history, phys ed.

15:20.260 --> 15:21.730
I understand, dear.

15:21.740 --> 15:24.610
I can't even find my locker.

15:25.640 --> 15:28.590
All right, I talked to
her. You owe me five bucks.

15:34.060 --> 15:36.560
He's a good wiper, and I love him.

15:36.920 --> 15:40.510
Hey, Alan, I just spoke... aw, geez.

15:41.560 --> 15:43.120
Good to see you, too, dear.

15:43.140 --> 15:44.120
What's going on, Mom?

15:44.130 --> 15:45.390
Nothing.

15:45.400 --> 15:50.040
I merely stop in to see my two
sons and my one and only grandchild.

15:50.050 --> 15:51.720
Well, it's...

15:54.280 --> 15:57.330
So, Mom, you're looking good.

15:57.340 --> 16:01.110
Did you have something
snipped or tucked or sucked?

16:01.120 --> 16:04.550
Just eyes and tush. But
nice of you to notice.

16:04.560 --> 16:08.390
Hey, Charlie, did you ever
find out if that kid is yours?

16:12.290 --> 16:13.620
Thanks a lot, Berta.

16:13.630 --> 16:16.280
Oh, dear, have I spoken out of turn?

16:20.820 --> 16:21.960
Kid?

16:21.980 --> 16:27.560
Yeah, well, it-it-it turns out that there
are flaws in every manufacturing process

16:27.570 --> 16:30.620
and that includes your
everyday latex products.

16:30.640 --> 16:33.990
I see. And how far
along is the young lady?

16:34.380 --> 16:36.330
Oh, about eight years.

16:36.340 --> 16:40.140
Eight years and she's
just suing you now?

16:41.060 --> 16:42.700
She's not suing me.

16:42.720 --> 16:44.910
She doesn't want to have
anything to do with me.

16:44.920 --> 16:46.090
Lucky you.

16:46.100 --> 16:49.990
If I were her, I'd have owned half
this house before the pee stick dried.

16:51.580 --> 16:53.080
Yeah, real lucky.

16:53.090 --> 16:55.730
I got an eight-year-old son and I'll
never get to spend any time with him.

16:55.740 --> 16:58.700
Oh, sweetheart, look, take it from me.

16:58.720 --> 17:02.350
Spending time with one's
children is greatly overrated.

17:04.720 --> 17:06.630
Oh, come on, face facts.

17:06.640 --> 17:09.339
Some people are meant to be
parents and some people aren't.

17:09.349 --> 17:12.180
And you have a perfect example of
that sitting right in front of you.

17:12.190 --> 17:14.810
You certainly do.

17:16.300 --> 17:18.790
Yeah, well, I think I'd be a great dad.

17:18.800 --> 17:23.349
Well, easy for you to say now
that you've dodged the bullet.

17:24.280 --> 17:27.220
You're right, talk is cheap.

17:29.770 --> 17:32.890
Remind me to speak to him about
putting this house in my name

17:32.910 --> 17:37.530
so it can never fall into the hands of
some money-hungry, manipulative bitch.

17:37.860 --> 17:40.970
That isn't related to him.

17:51.490 --> 17:52.740
What do you want now, Charlie?

17:52.760 --> 17:56.210
Look, I can see why you might not
think of me as father material.

17:56.230 --> 17:59.700
And clearly you've done a great
job raising Chuck on your own.

17:59.710 --> 18:04.440
I'd just like, if you'd let
me, to help out a little bit.

18:07.170 --> 18:09.120
This is more than a little bit.

18:09.150 --> 18:12.170
Hey, eight years is a long time.

18:12.180 --> 18:13.780
What do you want out of this?

18:13.790 --> 18:15.950
I just want to know
that he's taken care of.

18:15.970 --> 18:19.440
And I plan on sending
you a check every month.

18:19.450 --> 18:21.020
I-I don't know what to say.

18:21.030 --> 18:23.700
You don't have to worry
about me interfering.

18:23.710 --> 18:27.620
Although, there's a couple of things
you should know for when he gets older.

18:27.640 --> 18:29.740
Like what?

18:29.750 --> 18:33.150
Well, you're gonna want to
lock the liquor cabinet...

18:33.980 --> 18:38.070
But don't forget that mouthwash
can also pack a pretty good buzz.

18:38.400 --> 18:42.200
So be on guard for
suspiciously minty breath.

18:42.600 --> 18:48.100
Oh, and if his school nurse is at all
attractive, you can expect the occasional hernia.

18:50.160 --> 18:51.470
Thanks for the heads up.

18:51.480 --> 18:54.010
You're welcome.

18:54.790 --> 18:57.930
So, uh,...

18:58.280 --> 19:00.600
Good luck.

19:01.790 --> 19:04.540
You're gonna need it.

19:20.460 --> 19:23.790
Jeremy, your mom's here.

19:25.140 --> 19:26.830
- Hey, Mom.
- Hi, honey.

19:26.840 --> 19:28.540
Hey, where'd you get that shirt?

19:28.560 --> 19:31.020
Oh, I got it for him.
I hope that's okay.

19:31.030 --> 19:32.340
I love it.

19:32.350 --> 19:35.020
He looks like a little ladies' man.

19:35.560 --> 19:37.970
So, uh, is this time
next week okay for you?

19:37.980 --> 19:42.880
Actually, I think my
babysitting days are behind me.

19:42.890 --> 19:45.060
Ciao.

19:47.600 --> 19:50.370
w2m really glad you're accepting
responsibility, Charlie.

19:50.390 --> 19:51.120
Thank you.

19:51.150 --> 19:52.900
You'll see. It's a great
feeling knowing you're...

19:52.910 --> 19:55.320
you're taking care of your own kid.

19:55.840 --> 19:56.830
Oh, hey, Mr. Harper.

19:56.840 --> 19:58.680
- Hey, Clive, how's it going?
- Great.

19:59.000 --> 20:01.530
All right, Mrs. Melnick, that
should hold you for a while.

20:01.540 --> 20:03.290
- Hey, dude.
- Hey, dude.

20:05.530 --> 20:07.480
Thanks, Clive, you're the best.

20:07.490 --> 20:09.450
Come on in, honey. Thanks, Alan.

20:09.460 --> 20:11.580
Bye, buddy.

20:11.880 --> 20:13.010
Who was that guy?

20:13.030 --> 20:14.680
Oh, that's Clive, the exterminator.

20:14.690 --> 20:16.200
He's been coming here forever.

20:16.210 --> 20:19.530
Hey, Alan, has it
ever occurred to you...

20:19.540 --> 20:21.610
Hey, Mr. Harper.

20:22.680 --> 20:24.860
Hey, Craig.

20:27.520 --> 20:30.100
Has what ever occurred to me?

20:30.110 --> 20:31.580
Nothing.

20:31.590 --> 20:34.540
Hey, Mr. H. Long time no see.
