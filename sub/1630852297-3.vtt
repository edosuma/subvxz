been thus encountered:

14:27.840 --> 14:30.720

appears before them,

14:30.840 --> 14:33.560
and with solemn march goes slow and steady

14:33.680 --> 14:36.360
whilst they, distilled almost to jelly
with the act of fear,

14:36.480 --> 14:38.440
stood dumb and spoke not to him.

14:38.560 --> 14:40.880
This to me
in dreadful secrecy did they impart.

14:41.000 --> 14:43.280
I knew your father,
these hands are not more like.

14:44.320 --> 14:46.880
― But where was this?
― Upon the platform where we watch.

14:47.000 --> 14:50.000
― Did you not speak to it?
― My lord I did, but answer made it none.

14:50.120 --> 14:52.960
Yet once methought it lifted up its head

14:53.080 --> 14:56.440
and did address itself to motion
like as it would speak,

14:56.560 --> 15:00.920
but even then the morning cock crew loud
and at the sound it shrunk in haste away.

the cock that is the trumpet to the day

throat awake the god of day,

15:09.000 --> 15:11.400
whether in sea or fire, in earth or air,

15:11.520 --> 15:14.760
the itinerant and erring spirit
hies to his confine.

15:14.880 --> 15:18.040
And that the truth therein their witness
now doth make probation.

15:18.160 --> 15:20.920

15:21.040 --> 15:22.360
'tis true.

And we did think it writ down in our duty
to let you know of it.

― Saw you his face?
― Yes.

15:29.160 --> 15:30.200
How looked he, frowningly?

15:30.320 --> 15:32.720
A countenance more in sorrow
than in anger.

15:32.840 --> 15:34.600
― Pale or red?
― Nay, very pale.

15:34.720 --> 15:36.960
― And his eyes fixed upon you?
― Most constantly.

15:37.080 --> 15:39.480
― Would I had been there.
― It would have much amazed you.

15:39.600 --> 15:42.040
Very like, very like.
Hold you again the watch tonight?

15:42.160 --> 15:43.920
― We do, my lord.
― Perchance it will walk again.

15:44.040 --> 15:46.360
If it assume my noble father's person
I'll speak to it,

15:46.480 --> 15:48.760
though all hell should gape
and bid me hold my peace.

15:48.880 --> 15:49.880
I pray you both,

15:50.000 --> 15:53.880
if you have hitherto concealed this sight,
let it be held within your silence still

15:54.000 --> 15:58.200
and whatsoever else shall pass tonight,
give it an understanding but no tongue.

15:58.320 --> 16:00.840
Upon the platform,
'twixt 11 and 12, I'll visit you.

16:00.960 --> 16:04.240
― Our duty to your honour.
― Your love as mine to you. Farewell.

16:06.840 --> 16:08.320
All is not well.

16:09.680 --> 16:11.240
Would the night were come.

16:12.280 --> 16:14.200
Till then, sit still my soul.

16:16.200 --> 16:22.080
Foul deeds will rise, though all the earth
o'erwhelm them, to men's eyes.

16:44.960 --> 16:48.200
LAERTES: My necessaries
are embarked, farewell.

16:48.320 --> 16:52.480
And sister, as the winds give benefit
and convoy is assistant,

16:52.600 --> 16:56.400
― do not sleep, but let me hear from you.
― Do you doubt that?

16:59.800 --> 17:03.440
I see Prince Hamlet makes a show of love.

17:03.560 --> 17:07.240
Beware, Ophelia, do not trust his vows.

17:07.359 --> 17:12.440
Hold it a fashion and a toy in blood,
a violet in the spring of primy nature,

17:12.560 --> 17:14.280
fleeting, not permanent;

17:14.400 --> 17:19.040
sweet, not lasting;
the suppliance of the moment, no more.

17:19.160 --> 17:22.560
― No more but so?
― Think it no more.

17:22.680 --> 17:25.040
Perhaps he loves you now,

17:25.160 --> 17:28.960
and now his tongue
speaks from his heart, but yet take heed.

17:29.080 --> 17:31.520
His greatness weighed,
his will is not his own,

17:31.640 --> 17:34.000
for he himself is subject to his birth.

17:34.120 --> 17:38.480
He may not, as unvalued persons do,
choose for himself,

17:38.600 --> 17:43.880
for on his choice depends the sanctity
and health of this whole state.

17:44.480 --> 17:47.720
And therefore,
must his choice be circumscribed

17:47.840 --> 17:51.360
unto the voice and yielding
of that body whereof he is the head.

17:52.400 --> 17:57.840
Then if he says he loves you,
it fits your wisdom so far to believe it

17:57.960 --> 18:02.720
as he, in his especial rank and force,
may give his saying deed.

18:02.840 --> 18:06.200
And weigh what loss
your honour may sustain

18:06.320 --> 18:07.400
if with too credent ear

18:07.520 --> 18:10.240
― you list his songs or lose your heart.
― Ssh!

18:10.360 --> 18:14.480
Fear it, Ophelia.
Fear it, my dear sister.

18:17.040 --> 18:20.040
And keep within the rear
of your affection,

18:20.160 --> 18:24.200
out of the shot and danger of desire.

18:28.600 --> 18:32.040
I shall the effect
of this good lesson keep

18:32.160 --> 18:34.200
as watchman to my heart.

18:35.160 --> 18:37.560
But good my brother,

18:37.680 --> 18:41.640
do not as some ungodly pastors do,
show me the steep and thorny way to heaven

18:41.760 --> 18:45.480
whilst like a puffed
and reckless libertine himself

18:45.600 --> 18:48.120
the primrose path of dalliance treads

18:48.240 --> 18:51.160
and heeds not his own reed.

18:51.280 --> 18:53.200
Oh, fear me not!

19:25.840 --> 19:28.120
I stay too long. But here my father comes.

19:28.240 --> 19:32.240
A double blessing is a double grace.
Occasion smiles upon a second leave.

Aboard, aboard for shame.

There, my blessing with you!

19:38.880 --> 19:43.280

"Give thy thoughts no tongue,

"Give every man thine ear,

"Take each man's censure,

20:14.000 --> 20:18.000
This above all:
To thine own self be true.

And it must follow, as the night the day,
thou canst not then be false to any man.

20:26.120 --> 20:29.240
Farewell, my blessing season this in thee.

20:30.960 --> 20:36.320
Farewell, Ophelia,
and remember well what I have said to you.

20:37.360 --> 20:41.640
'Tis in my memory locked,
and you yourself shall keep the key of it.

20:42.360 --> 20:44.120
Farewell!

20:46.200 --> 20:48.640
What is it, Ophelia, he hath said to you?

20:48.760 --> 20:52.720
Oh! So please you,
something touching the Lord Hamlet.

20:52.840 --> 20:53.840
Marry, well bethought.

20:53.960 --> 20:56.760
'Tis told me he hath
very oft of late given private time to you

20:56.880 --> 20:59.880
and you yourself have of your audience
been most free and bounteous.

21:00.000 --> 21:01.720
If it be so, as so 'tis put on me,

21:01.840 --> 21:04.360
and that in way of caution,
I must tell you

21:04.480 --> 21:11.040
you do not understand yourself so clearly,
as it becomes my daughter and your honour.

21:12.080 --> 21:14.760
What is between you? Give me up the truth.

21:18.720 --> 21:20.520
He hath, my lord, of late...

21:20.640 --> 21:23.600
made many tenders
of his affection towards me.

21:23.720 --> 21:27.920
Affection? You speak like a green girl,
unsifted in such perilous circumstance.

21:28.040 --> 21:31.080
Do you believe his "tenders",
as you call them?

21:31.200 --> 21:33.080
I do not know, my lord,
what I should think.

21:33.200 --> 21:35.000
Marry, I will teach you.
Think yourself a baby

21:35.120 --> 21:38.440
that you've taken his tenders
for true pay, which are not sterling.

21:38.560 --> 21:44.680
My lord, he hath importuned me
with love in honourable fashion.

21:44.800 --> 21:46.560
Aye, fashion you may call it.

21:46.680 --> 21:52.640
And hath given countenance to his speech,
my lord, with all the vows of heaven.

21:52.760 --> 21:54.280
I do know when the blood burns

21:54.400 --> 21:57.240
how prodigally the soul
lends the tongue vows.

21:57.360 --> 22:01.960
These blazes, daughter, giving more light
than heat, you must not take for fire.

22:02.080 --> 22:05.560
For this time, daughter, be somewhat
scanter of your maiden presence.

22:05.680 --> 22:09.800
Set your entreatments at a higher rate
than a command to parley.

22:09.920 --> 22:13.080
For Lord Hamlet, believe so much in him
that he is royal,

22:13.200 --> 22:16.320
and with a larger tether may he walk
than may be given you.

22:16.440 --> 22:19.600
In brief, do not believe his vows.

22:19.720 --> 22:23.480
And for my own part, I would not,
in plain terms, from this time forth

22:23.600 --> 22:27.160
have you so slander any moment's leisure

22:27.280 --> 22:32.400
as to give words
or talk with the Lord Hamlet.

22:32.520 --> 22:34.560
Look to it, I charge you.

22:41.000 --> 22:43.120
I shall obey, my lord.

22:58.320 --> 23:01.480
― BERNARDO: What hour now?
― MARCELLUS: I think it lacks of twelve.

23:01.600 --> 23:06.040
― SOLDIER: No, it has struck.
― Indeed I heard it not.

23:07.280 --> 23:12.360
Well, then it draws near the season
wherein the spirit held his wont to walk.

23:13.640 --> 23:16.120
Thus twice before,
and just at this dead hour,

23:16.240 --> 23:19.280
with martial stalk
hath he gone by our watch.

23:19.400 --> 23:21.640
In what particular thought
to work I know not,

23:21.760 --> 23:25.720
but in the gross and scope of my opinion,

23:25.840 --> 23:28.960
this bodes
some strange eruption to our state.

23:31.520 --> 23:35.440
Good you now, canst tell me, if you know

23:35.560 --> 23:38.080
why this same strict
and most observant watch

23:38.200 --> 23:40.640
so nightly guards the subject of the land,

23:40.760 --> 23:46.160
and why such daily cast of brazen cannon
and foreign trade for implements of war?

23:46.280 --> 23:48.320
What might be toward,
that this sweaty haste

23:48.440 --> 23:50.720
doth make the night
joint-labourer with the day?

23:51.720 --> 23:56.920
To the wars, my boy, to the wars!
Or at least the whisper goes so.

23:57.920 --> 24:02.040
Our last king was, as you know,
by Fortinbras of Norway,

24:02.160 --> 24:05.440
thereto pricked on
by a most ambitious pride,

24:05.560 --> 24:10.680
dared to the combat in which our
valiant Hamlet did slay this Fortinbras

24:10.800 --> 24:13.120
who, by a sealed compact,

24:13.240 --> 24:15.040
did forfeit with his life

24:15.160 --> 24:18.560
all those his lands
which he stood seized of to the conqueror.

24:19.680 --> 24:27.120
Now sir, young Fortinbras,
of unimproved mettle hot and full,

24:27.240 --> 24:30.040
hath in the skirts of Norway
here and there

24:30.160 --> 24:33.440
sharked up a troop of lawless resolutes

24:33.560 --> 24:36.480
for to recover of us by strong hand

24:36.600 --> 24:40.160
those foresaid lands
so by his father lost.

24:40.280 --> 24:44.440
And this, I take it,
is the main motive of our preparations

24:44.560 --> 24:48.480
and the chief head of this great haste
and turmoil in the land.

24:48.600 --> 24:50.360
I think it be no other but even so.

24:50.480 --> 24:53.280
I'm well studied for a liberal thanks,
which I do owe you.

24:53.400 --> 24:56.320
― HORATIO: Marcellus, Barnardo.
― BARNARDO: My honoured lord.

24:58.000 --> 25:02.440
The air bites shrewdly, it is very cold.

25:02.560 --> 25:05.960
It is a nipping and an eager air.
Has this thing appeared again tonight?

25:06.080 --> 25:08.160
― I have seen nothing.
― (DISTANT RUMBLE)

25:08.280 --> 25:09.680
What does this mean, my lord?

25:09.800 --> 25:12.840

and takes his rouse,

25:12.960 --> 25:15.360
keeps wassail
and a swaggering upspring reels,

25:15.480 --> 25:18.680
and as he drains
his draughts of rhenish down,

25:18.800 --> 25:22.240
the kettledrum and trumpet
thus bray out the triumph of his pledge.

25:22.360 --> 25:25.240
― Is it a custom?
― Aye, marry it is.

25:25.960 --> 25:28.560
To my mind, though I am native here
and to the manner born,

25:28.680 --> 25:31.800
it is a custom more honoured in the breach
than the observance.

25:31.920 --> 25:33.920
― (LOUD RUMBLING)
― Peace, break thee off!

25:34.040 --> 25:37.080
― Look, my lord, it comes!
― Looks it not like the king?

of grace defend us!

or blasts from hell,

that I will speak with thee.

to go away with it.

26:11.640 --> 26:12.640
If it will not answer me,
then I will follow it.

26:12.760 --> 26:13.760
Do not, my lord.

26:13.880 --> 26:18.600
Why? What should be the fear?
I do not set my life at a pin's fee.

26:18.720 --> 26:22.640
As for my soul, what can it do to that,
being a thing immortal as itself?

26:22.760 --> 26:24.240
It waves me forth again, I will follow it.

26:24.360 --> 26:26.520
What if it tempt
you towards the flood, my lord?

26:26.640 --> 26:30.000
Or to the dreadful summit of the cliff
that o'ertops his base into the sea

26:30.120 --> 26:33.800
and there assumes some other horrible form
which might deprive you of your reason

26:33.920 --> 26:36.520
and draw you into madness?
Think of it!

26:37.280 --> 26:38.960
HAMLET: It waves me still,
I will follow it.

26:39.080 --> 26:40.240
You shall not go, my lord!

26:40.360 --> 26:42.600
― Hold off your hand.
― Be ruled, you shall not go.

26:42.720 --> 26:44.120
My fate cries out,

26:44.240 --> 26:49.680
and makes each petty artery in this body
as hardy as the Nemean lion's nerve.

26:49.800 --> 26:53.240
Unhand me, gentlemen, or by God
I'll make a ghost of him that stays me.

26:53.360 --> 26:56.040
I said away.

26:57.120 --> 27:00.200
Go on! I'll follow thee!

― He waxes desperate with imagination.
― 'Tis not fit thus to obey him.

27:04.320 --> 27:05.440
To what issue will this come?

27:05.560 --> 27:07.720
Something is rotten
in the state of Denmark.

27:07.840 --> 27:10.840
― Heaven will direct it.
― Nay, let's follow him.

Doomed for a certain term
to walk the night,

27:46.760 --> 27:50.480
and for the day
confined to fast in fires...

27:50.600 --> 27:52.040
― (FLAMES CRACKLE)
― ..till the foul crimes

27:52.160 --> 27:56.040
done in my days of nature
are burnt and purged away.

27:56.960 --> 28:01.960
But that I am forbid to tell the secrets
of my prison house, I could a tale unfold

28:02.080 --> 28:04.800
whose lightest word
would harrow up thy soul

28:04.920 --> 28:06.920
and freeze thy noble veins.

28:07.760 --> 28:12.640
But this eternal blazon must not be
to ears of flesh and blood.

28:13.680 --> 28:16.160
List, Hamlet, oh list.

28:16.280 --> 28:18.360
If thou didst ever thy dear father love...

28:18.480 --> 28:19.480
Oh, God!

28:19.600 --> 28:22.840
..revenge his foul
and most unnatural murder.

28:22.960 --> 28:26.120
― Murder?
― Murder most foul, as in the best it is,

28:26.240 --> 28:30.960
but this most foul, strange and unnatural.

28:31.080 --> 28:32.360
Haste me to know it,

28:32.480 --> 28:36.240
that I with wings as swift
as meditation may sweep to my revenge.

28:36.360 --> 28:39.120
It is given out that,
sleeping in my orchard,

28:39.240 --> 28:41.160
a serpent stung me.

28:42.040 --> 28:43.600
So the whole ear of Denmark

28:43.720 --> 28:47.800
is by a forged process
of my death rankly abused.

28:48.880 --> 28:50.840
But know thou, noble youth,

28:50.960 --> 28:54.120
the serpent that did sting
thy father's life

28:54.240 --> 28:58.320
― now wears his crown.
― O, my prophetic soul, mine uncle!

28:58.440 --> 29:02.600
Aye...that incestuous,
that adulterate beast

29:02.720 --> 29:04.400
with witchcraft of his wits

29:04.520 --> 29:09.920
won to his shameful lust the will
of my most seeming virtuous queen.

29:10.800 --> 29:18.360
Oh, Hamlet, what a falling-off was there,
from me, whose love was of that dignity

29:18.480 --> 29:22.160
that it went hand in hand even
with the vow I made to her in marriage,

29:22.280 --> 29:24.840
and to decline upon a wretch

29:24.960 --> 29:28.080
whose natural gifts
were poor to those of mine.

29:28.200 --> 29:29.200
But soft...

29:29.920 --> 29:32.400
..methinks I scent the morning air.

29:33.760 --> 29:35.000
Brief let me be.

29:36.200 --> 29:40.640
Sleeping within my orchard,
my custom always in the afternoon,

29:40.760 --> 29:48.160
upon my restful hour thy uncle stole,
with juice of cursed hebenon in a vial.

29:48.280 --> 29:52.360
And in the porches of mine ear
did pour the leperous distilment,

29:52.480 --> 29:55.840
whose effect holds such an enmity
with blood of man that,

29:55.960 --> 29:57.240
swift as quicksilver,

29:57.360 --> 30:00.560
it courses through the natural gates
and alleys of the body,

30:00.680 --> 30:02.640
and with a sudden vigour

30:02.760 --> 30:05.240
it doth posset and curd,

30:05.360 --> 30:09.320
like acid dropping into milk,
the thin and wholesome blood.

30:09.440 --> 30:16.880
So did it mine. And soon a foul eruption
barked about, most leper-like,

30:17.000 --> 30:21.280
with vile and loathsome crust,
all my smooth body!

30:23.920 --> 30:27.920
Thus was I, sleeping,

30:28.040 --> 30:31.840
by a brother's hand of life,

30:31.960 --> 30:35.040
of crown and queen at once dispatched,

30:35.160 --> 30:38.040
cut off even in the blossom of my sin.

30:38.160 --> 30:45.520
No reckoning made, but sent to my account
with all my imperfections on my head!

30:47.760 --> 30:49.760
Oh, horrible.

30:50.560 --> 30:52.120
Oh, horrible.

30:53.400 --> 30:54.840
Most horrible.

30:57.040 --> 31:00.800
If thou hast nature in thee, bear it not.

31:02.200 --> 31:07.400
Let not the royal bed of Denmark
be a couch for luxury and damned incest.

31:09.560 --> 31:11.560
But howsoever thou pursuest this act...

31:12.560 --> 31:17.440
..taint not thy mind, nor let thy soul
contrive against thy mother aught.

31:18.800 --> 31:20.560
Leave her to heaven,

31:20.680 --> 31:24.920
and to those thorns that in her bosom
lodge to prick and sting her.

31:26.520 --> 31:31.320
Fare thee well at once.
The glow worm shows the matin to be near.

31:34.360 --> 31:35.760
Adieu.

31:37.280 --> 31:38.600
Adieu.

31:42.360 --> 31:47.160
Hamlet, remember me!

31:47.280 --> 31:49.760
(THUNDERCLAP)

31:59.160 --> 32:01.480
Remember thee?

32:03.320 --> 32:09.000
Aye, thou poor ghost, while memory
holds a seat in this distracted globe.

32:09.120 --> 32:11.960
Remember thee?
Yea, from the tables of my memory

32:12.080 --> 32:15.800
I'll wipe away all trivial fond records,

32:15.920 --> 32:19.680
all saws of books, all forms,
all pressures past

32:19.800 --> 32:21.640
that youth and observation copied there,

32:21.760 --> 32:26.080
and thy commandment all alone shall live
within the book and volume of this brain,

32:26.200 --> 32:28.600
unmixed with baser matter.

32:28.720 --> 32:31.320
Oh, yes! Yes, by heaven!

32:35.920 --> 32:38.000
Oh, most pernicious woman.

32:39.800 --> 32:41.480
Oh, villain.

32:43.240 --> 32:44.640
Villain!

32:45.680 --> 32:49.440
Smiling damned villain!

32:49.560 --> 32:52.320

32:52.440 --> 32:57.560
that one may smile and smile
and be a villain.

32:57.680 --> 33:00.240
So uncle, there you are!

33:01.920 --> 33:04.640
And now to my word.
It is, "Adieu, adieu, remember me."

33:04.760 --> 33:06.600
And I have sworn it!

33:06.720 --> 33:09.320
― My lord, my lord!
― Lord Hamlet!

33:09.440 --> 33:11.560
― Heaven secure him!
― So be it.

33:11.680 --> 33:14.240
― How is it, my noble lord?
― Oh, wonderful!

33:14.360 --> 33:16.320
― Good my lord, tell it.
― Nay, but you'll reveal it.

33:16.440 --> 33:18.720
― Not I, my lord.
― How say you then, but you'll be secret?

33:18.840 --> 33:20.160
Aye by heaven, my lord.

33:20.280 --> 33:22.480
There's not a villain
dwelling in all Denmark

33:22.600 --> 33:23.880
but he's an arrant knave.

33:24.000 --> 33:26.880
There needs no ghost, my lord,
come from the grave to tell us that.

33:27.720 --> 33:30.040
Why right, you are in the right.

33:30.160 --> 33:32.680
It is an honest ghost,
that let me tell you.

33:32.800 --> 33:35.720
As for your desire
to know what stands between us,

33:35.840 --> 33:37.840
o'ermaster it as you may.
And now, good friends,

33:37.960 --> 33:40.200
― grant me one poor request.
― What is't, my lord?

33:40.320 --> 33:41.400
Never make known
what you have seen tonight.

33:41.520 --> 33:43.080
― My lord, we will not.
― Nay, but swear it.

33:43.200 --> 33:48.160
― GHOSTLY VOICE: Swear.
― Aha, oh boy, sayest thou so?

33:49.680 --> 33:52.440
Come, you hear this fellow,
consent to swear.

33:52.560 --> 33:53.760
Propose the oath, my lord.

33:53.880 --> 33:55.680
Never to speak of this
that you have seen tonight.

33:55.800 --> 33:57.360
― My lord, we will not.
― But swear it.

33:57.480 --> 33:59.680
― In faith, my lord, not I.
― Nor I my lord, in faith.

33:59.800 --> 34:01.800
GHOSTLY VOICE: Swear!

34:01.920 --> 34:04.160
Then we'll move our ground, come here!

34:04.280 --> 34:07.680
Upon my hand, never to speak of this
that you have heard.

34:07.800 --> 34:09.360
GHOSTLY VOICE: Swear!

34:09.480 --> 34:13.120
Well said, old mole,
canst work in the ground so fast?

34:14.520 --> 34:16.480
Once more remove, good friends.

34:16.600 --> 34:19.120
Oh, day and night,
but this is wondrous strange.

34:19.239 --> 34:22.000
Well, as a stranger, give it welcome.

34:22.840 --> 34:25.800
There are more things
in heaven and earth, Horatio,

34:25.920 --> 34:28.000
than are dreamt of in our philosophy.

34:28.120 --> 34:31.000
But come, here as before, and swear.

34:31.120 --> 34:32.120
GHOSTLY VOICE: Swear!

34:32.239 --> 34:33.639
ALL: I swear!

34:33.760 --> 34:37.120
Rest, rest, perturbed spirit!

34:40.000 --> 34:44.560
And swear besides,
howe'er so strange or odd I bear myself,

34:44.679 --> 34:47.560
as I perchance hereafter
shall think it meet

34:47.679 --> 34:49.600
to put an antic disposition on.

34:49.719 --> 34:53.600
That you at such time seeing me,
never shall with arms encumbered thus,

34:53.719 --> 34:56.520
or thus head shake, or by the pronouncing
of some doubtful phrase as,

34:56.639 --> 34:58.120
"Ooh, well, we know."

34:58.240 --> 35:03.200
"Oh, we could and if we would,"
that you know aught of me. Swear!

35:04.240 --> 35:06.240
ALL: By heaven, I swear!

35:06.360 --> 35:07.960
Gentlemen, with all my love
I do commend me to you,

35:08.080 --> 35:11.640
and still your fingers on your lips.
I pray.

35:16.800 --> 35:18.680
The time is out of joint.

35:20.120 --> 35:23.680
Oh cursed spite,
that ever I was born to set it right.

(CLOCK TICKS LOUDLY)

POLONIUS: How now, Ophelia,
what's the matter?

36:01.800 --> 36:05.560
Alas, my lord, I have been so affrighted.

36:05.680 --> 36:07.560
With what, in the name of heaven?

36:07.680 --> 36:10.560
My lord, as I was sewing in my chamber

36:10.680 --> 36:12.920
Lord Hamlet,
with his doublet all unbraced,

36:13.040 --> 36:15.720
pale as his shirt,
his knees knocking each other,

36:15.840 --> 36:17.920
and with a look so piteous in purport

36:18.040 --> 36:21.160
as if he had been loosed out of hell
to speak of horrors, he comes before me.

36:21.280 --> 36:24.160
― Mad for thy love?
― My lord, I do not know.

36:24.280 --> 36:25.600
What said he?

36:28.440 --> 36:31.240
He took me by the wrist and held me hard.

36:32.160 --> 36:33.720
Then goes he to the length of all his arm,

36:33.840 --> 36:35.520
and with his other hand
thus o'er his brow,

36:35.640 --> 36:40.560
he falls to such perusal of my face
as he would draw it. Long stayed he so.

36:41.680 --> 36:45.360
When at last,
his head thus waving up and down,

36:45.480 --> 36:48.440
he raised a sigh so piteous and profound

36:48.560 --> 36:53.360
that it did seem to shatter all his bulk
and end his being.

36:55.040 --> 36:57.640
That done, he lets me go.

36:58.560 --> 37:00.080
And with his head
over his shoulder turned

37:00.200 --> 37:02.400
he seemed to find his way
without his eyes,

37:02.520 --> 37:06.280
for out of doors he went
without their help,

37:06.400 --> 37:08.920
and to the last bended their light on me.

37:09.040 --> 37:10.560
This is the very ecstasy of love,

37:10.680 --> 37:13.640
whose violent property
fordoes itself and leads the will

37:13.760 --> 37:17.400
to desperate undertakings
as oft as any passion under heaven

37:17.520 --> 37:19.520
that does afflict our natures.

37:20.320 --> 37:23.840
What, have you given him
any hard words of late?

37:24.880 --> 37:27.000
No, my good lord.

37:27.920 --> 37:29.640
But as you did command,

37:29.760 --> 37:33.680
I did...repel his letters
and denied his access to me.

37:33.800 --> 37:36.040
That hath made him mad.

37:36.160 --> 37:40.440
I am sorry that with better speed
and judgement I had not noted him.

37:40.560 --> 37:44.680
I feared he did but trifle
and meant to wreck thee.

37:44.800 --> 37:48.880
Come, go we to the king.
This must be known.

38:17.920 --> 38:21.680
My liege and madam, to expostulate
what majesty should be, what duty is,

38:21.800 --> 38:23.600
why day is day,
night's night and time is time,

38:23.720 --> 38:26.120
were nothing but to waste night,
day and time.

38:26.240 --> 38:28.240
Therefore, since brevity
is the soul of wit

38:28.360 --> 38:31.800
and tediousness the limbs
and outward flourishes, I will be brief.

[AUDIENCE LAUGHS]

38:33.240 --> 38:34.720
Your noble son is mad.

38:35.560 --> 38:37.840
Mad I call it, for to define true madness,

38:37.960 --> 38:41.360
what is it but to be nothing else
than mad? But let that go.

38:41.480 --> 38:43.960
More matter with less art?

38:44.080 --> 38:46.640
Madam, I swear I use no art at all.

38:46.760 --> 38:48.400
Mad let us grant him then,

38:48.520 --> 38:52.560
and now remains that we find out
the cause of this effect.

38:52.680 --> 38:55.760
Or rather say, the cause of this defect.

38:55.880 --> 38:59.160
I have a daughter,
have whilst she is mine,

38:59.280 --> 39:04.200
who in her duty and obedience, mark,
hath given me this.

39:05.040 --> 39:07.280
Now gather and surmise.

39:07.400 --> 39:13.760
"To the celestial and my soul's idol,
the most beautified Ophelia."

39:13.880 --> 39:16.640

I will be faithful.

Doubt that the sun doth move,

"Doubt truth to be a liar,
But never doubt I love."

39:30.160 --> 39:32.480
This in obedience
hath my daughter shown me,

39:32.600 --> 39:34.120
and more above, hath his solicitings,

39:34.240 --> 39:38.560
as they fell out by time,
by means and place, all given to mine ear.

39:38.680 --> 39:42.040
But how has she received his love?

39:42.160 --> 39:44.080
What do you think of me?

39:44.200 --> 39:48.120
― As of a man faithful and honourable.
― I would fain prove so.

39:48.240 --> 39:51.280
But what might you think
if I had seen this hot love on the wing,

39:51.400 --> 39:54.520
as I perceived it, I must tell you that,
before my daughter told me?

39:54.640 --> 39:57.240
What might you,
or my dear majesty your queen here, think

39:57.360 --> 39:59.360
if I had played the bawd or go-between,

39:59.480 --> 40:02.560
or looked upon this love with idle sight?
What might you think?

40:02.680 --> 40:07.080
No, I went round to work
and my young mistress thus I did bespeak,

40:07.200 --> 40:11.680
"Lord Hamlet is a prince out of thy star,
this must not be."

40:12.560 --> 40:13.960
And then I precepts gave her,

40:14.080 --> 40:16.360
that she should lock herself
from his society,

40:16.480 --> 40:18.960
admit no messengers, receive no tokens.

40:19.080 --> 40:21.640
Which done,
she took the fruits of my advice

40:21.760 --> 40:24.720
and he, repulsed, a short tale to make,

40:24.840 --> 40:28.080
fell into a sadness,
thence into a weakness,

40:28.200 --> 40:32.800
thence into the madness
wherein now he raves.

40:32.920 --> 40:35.080
Do you think 'tis this?

40:35.200 --> 40:38.480
It may be very likely.

40:38.600 --> 40:40.800
Hath there been such a time,
I would fain know,

40:40.920 --> 40:44.400
that I have positively said 'tis so,
when it proved otherwise?

40:44.520 --> 40:45.560
Not that I know.

40:45.680 --> 40:47.760
Take this from this if this be otherwise.

40:47.880 --> 40:51.720
If circumstances lead me,
I will find where truth is hid,

40:51.840 --> 40:54.960
though it were hid indeed
within the centre.

40:55.080 --> 40:56.840
How may we try it further?

40:56.960 --> 41:01.240
You know sometimes he walks for hours
here in the lobby.

41:01.360 --> 41:02.680
So he does indeed.

41:02.800 --> 41:06.160
At such a time
I'll loose my daughter to him.

41:06.280 --> 41:09.880

mark the encounter.

41:10.000 --> 41:11.000

― Aye, sir.

a plentiful lack of wit,

42:48.920 --> 42:50.560
together with most weak hams.

42:50.680 --> 42:53.080
All of which, sir,
I most powerfully and potently do believe,

42:53.200 --> 42:56.040
yet I do not hold it honesty
to have it thus set down.

42:57.040 --> 43:01.560
You, sir, could grow as old as I am,
if like a crab you could go backwards.

43:03.000 --> 43:06.080
Though this be madness,
yet there is method in it.

43:06.200 --> 43:10.600
― Will you walk out of the air, my lord?
― Into my grave?

43:10.720 --> 43:13.800
My honourable lord,
I will take my leave of you.

43:13.920 --> 43:17.520
You cannot, sir, take from me anything
that I will more willingly part withal.

43:20.080 --> 43:22.080
Except my life.

43:23.520 --> 43:25.840
Except my life!

43:25.960 --> 43:28.280
Fare you well, my lord.

43:41.760 --> 43:43.960
To be or not to be.

43:46.520 --> 43:48.240
That is the question.

43:50.880 --> 43:52.520
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind

43:52.640 --> 43:56.400
to suffer the slings and arrows
of outrageous fortune

43:56.520 --> 44:01.720
or to take arms against a sea of troubles,

44:01.840 --> 44:04.600
and by opposing end them.

44:07.560 --> 44:08.840
To die.

44:11.160 --> 44:13.480
To sleep, no more.

44:16.360 --> 44:19.400
And by a sleep to say we end the heartache

44:19.520 --> 44:23.400
and the thousand natural shocks
that flesh is heir to.

44:27.600 --> 44:30.240
'Tis a consummation devoutly to be wished.

44:32.320 --> 44:35.840
To die...to sleep!

44:36.880 --> 44:39.040
To sleep, perchance to dream.

44:39.160 --> 44:40.600
Aye, there's the rub.

44:41.600 --> 44:44.600
For in that sleep of death
what dreams may come

44:44.720 --> 44:50.280
when we have shuffled off this mortal coil
must give us pause.

44:54.640 --> 45:01.040
There's the respect
that makes calamity of so long life.

45:04.080 --> 45:08.840
For who would bear
the whips and scorns of time,

45:08.960 --> 45:13.040
the oppressor's wrong,
the proud man's contumely,

45:13.160 --> 45:17.000
the pangs of disprized love,
the law's delay,

45:17.120 --> 45:20.600
the insolence of office and the spurns
that patient merit of the unworthy takes

45:20.720 --> 45:24.840
when he himself might his quietus make
with a bare bodkin?

45:24.960 --> 45:30.040
Who would these fardels bear,
to grunt and sweat under a weary life

45:30.160 --> 45:35.000
but for the dread
of something after death?

45:39.640 --> 45:44.440
The undiscovered country
from whose bourne no traveller returns.

45:46.240 --> 45:51.560
It puzzles the will, and makes us
rather bear those ills we have

45:51.680 --> 45:54.360
than fly to others we know not of.

45:56.840 --> 46:00.720
Thus conscience
doth make cowards of us all.

46:03.360 --> 46:06.680
And thus the native hue of resolution

46:06.800 --> 46:10.560
is sicklied o'er
with the pale cast of thought.

46:12.520 --> 46:16.560
And enterprises
of great pitch and moment...

46:18.840 --> 46:24.640
..in this regard their currents turn awry
and lose the name of action.

46:49.120 --> 46:52.560
The ambassadors from Norway
are joyfully returned.

46:52.680 --> 46:55.200
KING: They're welcome both,
let them have kind admission.

46:55.320 --> 46:58.240
How do I long to hear how they were found.

46:59.880 --> 47:01.440
Welcome, good friends.

47:01.560 --> 47:03.400
Say, Voltemand,

47:03.520 --> 47:06.200
what from our brother Norway?

47:06.320 --> 47:10.320
Most fair return of greetings and desires.

47:10.440 --> 47:13.960
Sovereign lord,
the word of peace is rendered

47:14.080 --> 47:16.640
between our nation
and its neighbour state.

47:16.760 --> 47:19.080
Heavens thank thee for it.

47:19.200 --> 47:22.680
Upon our first he sent out to supress
his nephew's levies,

47:22.800 --> 47:26.760
which to him appeared
to be preparations against the Polish.

47:26.880 --> 47:29.000
But better looked into,

47:29.120 --> 47:31.360
he truly found
it was against your highness,

47:31.480 --> 47:36.080
sends out arrests on Fortinbras,
which he, in brief, obeys,

47:36.200 --> 47:42.280
receives rebuke from Norway
and in fine makes vow before his uncle

47:42.400 --> 47:46.320
never more to give the assay of arms
against your majesty.

47:47.640 --> 47:52.280
Whereon old Norway, overcome with joy,

47:52.400 --> 47:55.280
gives him permission
to employ those soldiers

47:55.400 --> 47:59.000
so levied as before against the Polish.

47:59.120 --> 48:03.360
With an entreaty herein further shown
that it might please you

48:03.480 --> 48:08.320
to give peaceful passage
through your dominions for his enterprise.

48:08.440 --> 48:10.200
It likes us well,

48:10.320 --> 48:15.720
and at a more considered time we'll read,
answer and think upon this business.

48:15.840 --> 48:18.960
Meantime, we thank you
for your well-took labour.

48:19.080 --> 48:21.600
Go to your rest,
tonight we'll dine together.

48:21.720 --> 48:26.240
I hold my duty as I hold my soul,
both to my God and to my gracious king.

48:26.360 --> 48:28.240
Most welcome home.

48:28.360 --> 48:30.400
POLONIUS: This business is well ended.

48:30.520 --> 48:36.480
Sweet Gertrude leave us too,
for we have closely sent for Hamlet hither

48:36.600 --> 48:39.800
that he, as 'twere by accident,
may here confront Ophelia.

48:39.920 --> 48:42.280
Her father and myself
will so bestow ourselves

48:42.400 --> 48:46.720
that seeing, unseen,
we may of their encounter frankly judge

48:46.840 --> 48:49.480
and gather by him, as he is behaved,

48:49.600 --> 48:54.720
if it be the affliction of his love or no
that thus he suffers for.

48:54.840 --> 48:57.520
I doubt it is no other but the main,

48:57.640 --> 49:01.320
his father's death
and our o'erhasty marriage.

49:02.960 --> 49:05.960
For your part, Ophelia,

49:06.080 --> 49:12.000
I do wish your good beauties
be the happy cause of Hamlet's wildness.

49:12.760 --> 49:18.000
So shall I hope your virtues
shall bring him to his wonted way again.

49:18.120 --> 49:21.720
― Madam, I wish it may.
― Ophelia, walk you here.

49:21.840 --> 49:23.360
Read on this book,

49:23.480 --> 49:27.080
that show of such an exercise
may colour your loneliness.

49:27.200 --> 49:29.280
Let's withdraw, my lord.

49:50.960 --> 49:54.200
(PLAYS SIMPLE MELODY)

50:09.480 --> 50:10.800
The fair Ophelia.

50:13.480 --> 50:17.040
Nymph, in thy orisons
be all my sins remembered.

50:19.400 --> 50:23.800
Good my lord,
how does your honour for this many a day?

50:23.920 --> 50:26.040
I humbly thank you, well.

50:28.240 --> 50:29.240
Well...

50:31.840 --> 50:32.840
Well.

50:36.320 --> 50:40.640
My lord, I have remembrances of yours
that I have longed long to redeliver.

50:41.880 --> 50:45.280
― I pray you now receive them.
― No, not I. I never gave you aught.

50:47.640 --> 50:50.160
My honoured lord,
you know right well you did.

50:51.120 --> 50:55.480
And with them words of so sweet breath
composed as made the things more rich.

50:56.520 --> 50:58.520
Their perfume left, take these again,

50:58.640 --> 51:02.280
for to the noble mind rich gifts
wax poor when givers prove unkind.

51:03.160 --> 51:04.400
There, my lord.

51:07.920 --> 51:10.640
― Are you honest?
― Yes, my lord.

51:15.000 --> 51:19.000
― I did love you once.
― Indeed, my lord, you made me believe so.

51:19.120 --> 51:20.440
You should not have believed it.
I loved you not.

51:20.560 --> 51:21.640
I was the more deceived.

51:22.720 --> 51:24.200
Get thee to a nunnery.

51:26.840 --> 51:30.960
Why wouldst thou be a breeder of sinners?
I am myself indifferent honest.

51:31.080 --> 51:36.000
Yet I could accuse me of such things
it were better my mother had not borne me.

51:36.120 --> 51:40.920
I'm very proud...revengeful, ambitious.

51:41.040 --> 51:43.480
With more offences at my beck
than I have thoughts to put them in,

51:43.600 --> 51:46.000
imagination to give them shape
or time to act them in.

51:46.120 --> 51:49.000
What should fools as I do
crawling between heaven and Earth?

51:49.120 --> 51:51.960
We're arrant knaves all,
believe none of us.

51:54.600 --> 51:56.480
― Where's your father?
― At home, my lord.

51:56.600 --> 51:58.400
Let the doors be shut on him,

51:58.520 --> 52:01.120
that he may play the fool
nowhere but in his own house!

52:01.240 --> 52:02.760
Oh help him, sweet heavens!

52:02.880 --> 52:05.200
If thou dost marry
I'll give thee this plague for thy dowry:

52:05.320 --> 52:09.320
Be thou as chaste as ice, as pure as snow,
thou shall not escape calumny.

52:09.440 --> 52:10.920
Now, get thee to a nunnery,
and quickly too,

52:11.040 --> 52:13.080
or if thou wilt marry, marry a fool,

52:13.200 --> 52:15.840
for wise men know well enough
what monsters you make of them.

52:15.960 --> 52:17.840
Oh, heavenly powers, restore him!

52:20.320 --> 52:23.840
God hath given you one face
and you make yourself another.

52:23.960 --> 52:27.640
You amble, you lisp, you jig,
you nickname God's creatures.

52:27.760 --> 52:31.560
You make your wantonness your ignorance!

52:31.680 --> 52:34.440
Go to, I'll no more of it,
it hath made me mad.

52:35.680 --> 52:38.400
I say we shall have no more marriages!

52:40.040 --> 52:44.840
(SHOUTS) All those that are married,
all but one shall live.

52:47.280 --> 52:49.640
The rest shall stay as they are.

52:49.760 --> 52:51.440
To a nunnery, go.

53:00.680 --> 53:04.200
Oh, what a noble mind is here o'erthrown.

53:05.640 --> 53:08.600
The courtier's, soldier's, scholar's,
eye, tongue, sword,

53:08.720 --> 53:12.400
the expectancy and rose
of the fair state,

53:12.520 --> 53:16.760
the glass of fashion
and the mould of form,

53:16.880 --> 53:21.440
the observed
of all observers quite, quite down.

53:24.840 --> 53:32.200
And I, of ladies most deject and wretched,
that sucked the honey of his music vows

53:32.320 --> 53:36.280
now see that noble
and most sovereign reason like...

53:37.440 --> 53:42.960
..like sweet bells
jangled out of tune and harsh.

53:45.880 --> 53:52.880
That unmatched form and feature
of blown youth blasted with ecstasy!

53:53.000 --> 53:56.120
Oh, woe is me...

53:57.280 --> 54:00.280
..to have seen what I have seen...

54:01.520 --> 54:03.080
..see what I see.

54:03.760 --> 54:08.720
Love? His affections do not that way tend!

54:08.840 --> 54:14.000
Nor what he spoke, though it lacked form
a little, was not like madness.

54:14.120 --> 54:18.280
But yet do I believe
the origin and commencement of this grief

54:18.400 --> 54:20.960
springs from neglected love.

54:21.080 --> 54:26.960
There's something in his soul
o'er which his melancholy sits on brood

54:27.080 --> 54:30.920
and I do fear the hatch and the disclose
will be some danger.

54:33.120 --> 54:34.400
How now, my good lord?

54:34.520 --> 54:36.720
You need not tell us
what Lord Hamlet said.

54:36.840 --> 54:38.760
We heard it all.

55:11.000 --> 55:14.960
Welcome, dear Rosencrantz
and Guildenstern.

55:15.080 --> 55:18.760
Moreover that we much did long to see you,

55:18.880 --> 55:22.920
the need we have to use you
did provoke our hasty sending.

55:23.040 --> 55:27.600
Something you have heard
of Hamlet's transformation.

55:27.720 --> 55:33.080
So I call it, since not the exterior
nor the inward man resembles what it was.

55:33.200 --> 55:36.840
What it should be,
more than his father's death,

55:36.960 --> 55:39.440
that thus hath put him so much
from the understanding of himself,

55:39.560 --> 55:41.320
I cannot dream of.

55:41.440 --> 55:44.040
I entreat you both,

55:44.160 --> 55:47.520
that being of so young days
brought up with him,

55:47.640 --> 55:49.240
and since so neighboured
to his youth and humours,

55:49.360 --> 55:51.760
to draw him on to pleasures

55:51.880 --> 55:57.440
and to glean whether aught to us unknown
afflicts him thus

55:57.560 --> 56:01.800
that disclosed, lies within our purpose.

56:01.920 --> 56:06.080
He hath of late
much talked of you, good sirs,

56:06.200 --> 56:09.400
and sure I am,
two men there are not living

56:09.520 --> 56:11.360
to whom he more adheres.

56:11.480 --> 56:16.200
If it shall please you to show us
so much kindness and goodwill

56:16.320 --> 56:22.200
as to expend your time with us a while
for the supply and profit of our hope,

56:22.320 --> 56:28.000
your visitation shall receive from us
such thanks as fits a king's remembrance.

56:28.120 --> 56:32.600
Both your majesties might,
by the sovereign power you have of us,

56:32.720 --> 56:37.240
put your dread pleasures
more into command than to entreaty.

56:37.360 --> 56:40.960
But we both obey, and here
give up ourselves in the full bent

56:41.080 --> 56:46.520
to lay our service freely at your feet
to be commanded.

56:46.640 --> 56:52.360
Heaven make our presence and our practices
pleasant...and helpful...to him.

56:52.480 --> 56:56.920
Thanks, gentle
Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.

56:57.760 --> 57:01.200
Thanks, Guildenstern
and gentle Rosencrantz.

57:02.120 --> 57:07.600
And I beseech you instantly to visit
my too much changed son.

57:08.720 --> 57:13.280
Voltemand, I charge you,
bring the gentlemen where Hamlet is.

57:14.560 --> 57:16.880
Go you to seek the Lord Hamlet?

57:17.000 --> 57:18.760
(BRASS BAND STRIKES UP)

57:18.880 --> 57:21.640
― There he is.
― God save you!

57:31.320 --> 57:33.520
[AUDIENCE LAUGHS]

57:35.000 --> 57:38.120
― Mine honoured lord?
― My most dear lord!

57:41.280 --> 57:42.440
(MUSIC STOPS)

57:44.000 --> 57:45.600
My dear good friends!

57:46.560 --> 57:48.560
Guildenstern, how dost thou?

57:48.680 --> 57:53.800
Oh, Rosencrantz, good lads,
how do you both? Haha!

57:53.920 --> 57:55.920
As the indifferent children of the earth.

57:56.040 --> 57:58.320
Happy in that we're not over-happy.

57:58.440 --> 58:00.760
On fortune's cap
we're not the very button.

58:00.880 --> 58:03.240
― Nor the soles of her shoe.
― Neither, my lord.

58:03.360 --> 58:06.480
Then you live somewhere about her waist
or in the middle of her favour?

58:06.600 --> 58:09.200
Faith, her privates, we.

58:09.320 --> 58:11.520
― Oh, no...
― [LAUGHTER]

58:11.640 --> 58:12.640
What's the news?

58:12.760 --> 58:15.880
None, my lord,
but that the world's grown honest.

58:16.000 --> 58:18.640
Then is doomsday near.

58:18.760 --> 58:22.360
But what have you deserved
at the hands of fortune

58:22.480 --> 58:25.600
― that she has sent you to prison hither?
― Prison, my lord?

58:25.720 --> 58:28.720
― Denmark is a prison.
― Then is the world one.

58:28.840 --> 58:30.600
A goodly one,
in which there are many confines,

58:30.720 --> 58:33.760
wards and dungeons,
Denmark being one of the worst.

58:33.880 --> 58:36.240
― I think not so, my lord.
― Then 'tis none to you.

58:36.360 --> 58:39.440
For there is nothing either good or bad
but thinking makes it so.

58:40.720 --> 58:42.520
But to me, it is a prison.

58:42.640 --> 58:46.400
Why then, your ambition makes it one.
'Tis too narrow for your mind.

58:46.520 --> 58:49.680
Oh God, I could be bounded in a nutshell

58:49.800 --> 58:52.280
and count myself a king
of infinite space...

58:54.560 --> 58:56.760
..were it not that I have bad dreams.

58:56.880 --> 58:59.480
But no such matter.
What make you from England?

58:59.600 --> 59:02.200
To visit you, my lord, no other occasion.

59:02.320 --> 59:04.040
Were you not sent for?

59:06.520 --> 59:08.520
Is it a free visitation?

59:08.640 --> 59:10.760
Come, deal justly with me.

59:11.720 --> 59:14.720
Come, come. Nay, speak.

59:14.840 --> 59:18.360
― What should we say, my lord?
― Why, anything but to the purpose.

59:19.000 --> 59:22.040
You were sent for,
there's a kind of confession in your looks

59:22.160 --> 59:24.800
which your modesties
have not craft enough to cover.

59:25.800 --> 59:29.680
I know the good queen and...king
have sent for you.

59:29.800 --> 59:32.600
― To what end my lord?
― That you must teach me.

59:32.720 --> 59:35.640
But let me conjure you by the rights
of our fellowship,

59:35.760 --> 59:36.880
be even and direct with me,

59:37.000 --> 59:41.000
― whether you were sent for or no.
― My lord, we were sent for.

59:42.240 --> 59:43.640
[LAUGHTER]

59:43.760 --> 59:48.440
I shall tell you why, so shall
my anticipation prevent your discovery.

59:50.440 --> 59:56.520
I have of late, but wherefore I know not,
lost all my mirth...

59:58.520 --> 1:00:00.680
..forgone all custom of exercise.

1:00:02.880 --> 1:00:05.360
Indeed it goes so heavily
with my disposition

1:00:05.480 --> 1:00:09.720
that this...goodly frame, the Earth...

1:00:11.480 --> 1:00:14.040
..seems to me a sterile promontory.

1:00:17.200 --> 1:00:20.320
This most excellent canopy, the air...

1:00:22.120 --> 1:00:23.240
..look you...

1:00:24.840 --> 1:00:28.240
..this brave o'erhanging firmament...

1:00:29.400 --> 1:00:33.360
..this majestical roof
fretted with golden fire,

1:00:33.480 --> 1:00:35.320
why, it appeareth to me no other thing

1:00:35.440 --> 1:00:39.280
but a foul and pestilent
congregation of vapours.

1:00:46.320 --> 1:00:49.160
What a piece of work is a man!

1:00:51.040 --> 1:00:53.160
How noble in reason!

1:00:55.040 --> 1:00:57.440
How infinite in faculty!

1:00:58.960 --> 1:01:01.960
Form and moving,
how express and admirable!

1:01:04.840 --> 1:01:09.880
In action, how like an angel!
In apprehension, how like a god!

1:01:11.800 --> 1:01:17.360
The beauty of the world,
the paragon of animals.

1:01:19.920 --> 1:01:25.240
And yet to me,
what is this quintessence of dust?

1:01:28.840 --> 1:01:32.200
Man delights not me.

1:01:38.280 --> 1:01:40.400
No, nor woman neither,

1:01:40.520 --> 1:01:43.440
though by your smiling
you would seem to say so.

1:01:43.560 --> 1:01:45.640
My lord,
there was no such stuff in my thoughts.

1:01:45.760 --> 1:01:48.600
Why did you laugh
when I said man delights not me?

1:01:48.720 --> 1:01:51.040
― (KNOCK ON DOOR)
― POLONIUS: Well be with you, gentlemen!

1:01:51.160 --> 1:01:53.760
MIMICS POLONIUS: My lord,
I have news to tell you!

1:01:53.880 --> 1:01:55.760
POLONIUS: My lord,
I have news to tell you!

1:01:55.880 --> 1:01:57.040
Buzz buzz!

1:01:57.160 --> 1:02:00.120
POLONIUS: My lord,
I do entreat your patience

1:02:00.240 --> 1:02:03.480
to hear me speak the message I am sent on.

1:02:04.480 --> 1:02:07.000
― Boom! Boom!
― (HAMLET CHUCKLES)

1:02:07.120 --> 1:02:11.840
POLONIUS: The actors are come hither,
my lord, upon my honour.

1:02:11.960 --> 1:02:15.120
Gentlemen, give me your hands.
You are welcome to Elsinore,

1:02:15.240 --> 1:02:18.520
but my uncle-father
and aunt-mother are deceived.

1:02:18.640 --> 1:02:23.080
― In what, my dear lord?
― I am but mad north-north-west.

1:02:23.200 --> 1:02:26.480
When the wind is southerly
I know a hawk from a handsaw.

1:02:26.600 --> 1:02:28.120
What players are they?

1:02:28.240 --> 1:02:30.400
Even those
you were wont to take delight in.

1:02:30.520 --> 1:02:34.280
"The Tragedians of the City,
the best act..."

1:02:34.400 --> 1:02:39.960
Ooh! "The best actors in the world,

1:02:40.080 --> 1:02:42.680
"either for tragedy, comedy,

1:02:42.800 --> 1:02:45.280
"history, pastoral,

1:02:45.400 --> 1:02:49.320
"pastoral-comical, historical-pastoral,

1:02:49.440 --> 1:02:52.760
"tragical-historical,
tragical-comical-historical-pastoral."

1:02:52.880 --> 1:02:54.120
[LAUGHTER]

1:02:54.240 --> 1:02:55.400
How chances it they travel?

1:02:55.520 --> 1:02:57.400
Do they hold the same estimation
they did when I was in the city?

1:02:57.520 --> 1:03:00.320
Are they so followed? How comes it?
Do they grow rusty? Come on man, about it!

1:03:00.440 --> 1:03:03.040
They attendeth here hard by
to know your answer,

1:03:03.160 --> 1:03:04.920
whether you'll admit them or no.

1:03:05.040 --> 1:03:07.000
Let the doors be open to them.

1:03:07.120 --> 1:03:10.480
Masters, you are welcome. Welcome all.

1:03:10.600 --> 1:03:15.760
Oh! My good old friend,
I am glad to see thee well.

1:03:15.880 --> 1:03:18.520
What, thy face is bearded
since I saw thee last.

1:03:18.640 --> 1:03:22.720
Ah, my young lady and my mistress!

1:03:22.840 --> 1:03:25.920
(KISS) Masters,
you are all welcome all. Come!

1:03:26.040 --> 1:03:30.440
We'll e'en to it like French falconers,
fly at anything we see.

1:03:30.560 --> 1:03:32.000
We'll have a speech straight.

1:03:33.200 --> 1:03:35.320
Come, a passionate speech.

1:03:35.440 --> 1:03:39.040
― What speech, my lord?
― I heard thee speak a speech once.

1:03:39.160 --> 1:03:42.200
Though it was never acted,
or if it was, not above once,

1:03:42.320 --> 1:03:44.600
for the play, I remember,
pleased not the million,

1:03:44.720 --> 1:03:46.360
though it was, as I received it,

1:03:46.480 --> 1:03:49.640
and others whose judgments in such matters
cries in the top of mine,

1:03:49.760 --> 1:03:50.920
an excellent play.

1:03:51.040 --> 1:03:52.960
One speech in it I chiefly loved.

1:03:53.080 --> 1:03:57.000
'Twas Aeneas's tale to Dido,
where he speaks of Priam's slaughter.

1:03:57.120 --> 1:03:59.960
If it live in your memory,
begin at this line.

1:04:00.080 --> 1:04:01.160
Let me see, let me see...

1:04:04.200 --> 1:04:05.920
The rugged Pyrrhus...

1:04:07.160 --> 1:04:09.520
..like the Hyrcanian beast...?

1:04:09.640 --> 1:04:12.560
No. 'Tis not so, it begins Pyrrhus.

1:04:12.680 --> 1:04:13.920
The rugged Pyrrhus...

1:04:15.720 --> 1:04:17.360
..he whose sable arms,

1:04:17.480 --> 1:04:19.960
black as his purpose,
did the night resemble

1:04:20.080 --> 1:04:23.480
when he lay couched in the ominous horse,

1:04:23.600 --> 1:04:28.560
hath now his dread and black complexion
smeared with heraldry more dismal:

1:04:28.680 --> 1:04:34.240
head to foot the blood of fathers,
mothers, daughters, sons.

1:04:35.360 --> 1:04:38.760
Thus o'er-sized with coagulate gore,

1:04:38.880 --> 1:04:41.800
the hellish Pyrrhus
old grandsire Priam seeks.

1:04:45.240 --> 1:04:47.440
So proceed you.

1:04:48.280 --> 1:04:53.800
Anon he finds him
striking too short at Greeks.

1:04:53.920 --> 1:04:56.880
His antique sword, rebellious to his arm,
lies where it falls,

1:04:57.000 --> 1:04:58.880
rejecting all command.

1:04:59.720 --> 1:05:06.160
Unequal matched Pyrrhus at Priam drives,
in rage strikes wide,

1:05:06.280 --> 1:05:09.400
but with the weight and wind
of his fell sword...

1:05:10.400 --> 1:05:12.040
..the unnerved father falls.

1:05:13.200 --> 1:05:17.440
Then did the senseless city
seem to feel this blow

1:05:17.560 --> 1:05:20.160
and with a hideous crash
take prisoner Pyrrhus' ear.

1:05:20.280 --> 1:05:22.360
For lo, his sword,

1:05:22.480 --> 1:05:27.520
which was declining
upon the milky head of the reverend Priam,

1:05:27.640 --> 1:05:30.680
seemed in the air to stick,

1:05:30.800 --> 1:05:34.440
so as a painted tyrant,
Pyrrhus stood...

1:05:35.600 --> 1:05:37.040
..and did nothing.

1:05:38.720 --> 1:05:42.040
But as we often see before a storm
a silence in the heavens,

1:05:42.160 --> 1:05:43.200
the clouds stand still,

1:05:43.320 --> 1:05:49.080
the bold winds speechless
and the orb below as hush as death.

1:05:50.040 --> 1:05:54.880
Anon the dreadful thunder
doth rend the region!

1:05:55.000 --> 1:06:00.360
So after Pyrrhus' pause
a roused vengeance set him new a-work

1:06:00.480 --> 1:06:03.600
and never did the Cyclops' hammer fall
on Mars his armours,

1:06:03.720 --> 1:06:06.160
forged for proof eterne

1:06:06.280 --> 1:06:08.120
with less remorse

1:06:08.240 --> 1:06:13.840
than Pyrrhus' bleeding sword
then fell on Priam.

1:06:13.960 --> 1:06:14.960
Say on.

1:06:16.440 --> 1:06:18.440
Come to Hecuba.

1:06:20.280 --> 1:06:25.040
But who, oh who had seen the mobled queen
run barefoot up and down,

1:06:25.160 --> 1:06:28.000
threatening the flames
with blinding tears,

1:06:28.120 --> 1:06:34.560
a cloth about her head
where late a crown had stood,

1:06:34.680 --> 1:06:39.680
and for a robe
around her gaunt and blood soaked limbs,

1:06:39.800 --> 1:06:43.120
a blanket in the alarm of fear caught up.

1:06:45.200 --> 1:06:50.880
Who had this seen, with tongue
in venom steeped against fortune's state,

1:06:51.000 --> 1:06:53.880
would treason have pronounced.

1:06:55.400 --> 1:06:57.920
And if the Gods themselves
did see her then

1:06:58.040 --> 1:07:00.360
when she saw Pyrrhus

1:07:00.480 --> 1:07:06.280
make malicious sport in mincing
with his sword her husband's limbs,

1:07:06.400 --> 1:07:11.400
the instant scream of horror
that she made,

1:07:11.520 --> 1:07:16.760
unless things mortal move them not at all
would have made weep

1:07:16.880 --> 1:07:19.440
the burning eyes of heaven

1:07:19.560 --> 1:07:22.320
and passion in the gods.

1:07:23.760 --> 1:07:26.920
Oh, what a rogue and peasant slave am I!

1:07:28.040 --> 1:07:32.280
Is it not monstrous that this player here
but in a fiction, in a dream of passion,

1:07:32.400 --> 1:07:36.080
could force his soul
so to his whole conceit?

1:07:36.200 --> 1:07:37.920
That from her working
all his visage wanned,

1:07:38.040 --> 1:07:40.400
tears in his eyes,
distraction in his aspect,

1:07:40.520 --> 1:07:46.480
a broken voice, indeed, his whole form
suiting with functions to his conceit.

1:07:46.600 --> 1:07:49.720
And all for nothing!

1:07:52.680 --> 1:07:54.080
For Hecuba.

1:07:56.520 --> 1:08:02.200
What's Hecuba to him, or he to her
that he should weep for her?

1:08:02.320 --> 1:08:07.080
What would he do, had he the motive
and cue for passion that I have?

1:08:08.200 --> 1:08:15.640
Then he would drown the stage with tears,
cleave the general ear with horrid speech,

1:08:15.760 --> 1:08:19.719
make mad the guilty, appal the free,
confound the ignorant

1:08:19.840 --> 1:08:24.200
and amaze indeed
the very faculties of eyes and ears.

1:08:24.319 --> 1:08:25.719
Yet I...

1:08:27.000 --> 1:08:30.399
..a dull and muddy-mettled rascal,

1:08:30.520 --> 1:08:33.520
peak like John-a-dreams,
unpregnant of my cause

1:08:33.639 --> 1:08:35.719
and can say nothing.

1:08:36.800 --> 1:08:40.360
No, not for a king upon whose property
and most dear life

1:08:40.479 --> 1:08:43.160
a damned defeat was made.

1:08:48.960 --> 1:08:51.280
Am I a coward?

1:08:56.160 --> 1:08:57.680
Who calls me villain?

1:09:06.080 --> 1:09:08.120
Why, I should take it.

1:09:09.479 --> 1:09:15.600
For it cannot be but I am pigeon-livered
and lack gall to make oppression bitter

1:09:15.719 --> 1:09:19.319
or ere this I would have fatted
all the region kites

1:09:19.440 --> 1:09:21.800
with this slave's offal.

1:09:21.920 --> 1:09:23.960
Bloody, bawdy villain!

1:09:24.920 --> 1:09:30.880
Remorseless, lecherous,
treacherous, kindless villain!

1:09:31.000 --> 1:09:33.360
Oh, vengeance!

1:09:45.840 --> 1:09:48.680
Why, what an ass am I.

1:09:52.479 --> 1:09:58.080
This is most brave that I,
the son of the dear murdered,

1:09:58.200 --> 1:10:00.840
prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell,

1:10:00.960 --> 1:10:04.960
must first, like a whore,
unpack my heart with words

1:10:05.080 --> 1:10:08.920
and fall a-cursing
like a very drab, a scullion.

1:10:09.040 --> 1:10:11.840
Fie upon it, foh! About, my brain!

1:10:20.840 --> 1:10:24.680
I have heard is said that guilty creatures
sitting at a play have,

1:10:24.800 --> 1:10:26.280
by the very cunning of the scene,

1:10:26.400 --> 1:10:31.719
been struck so to the soul that presently
they have proclaimed their malefactions.

1:10:31.840 --> 1:10:34.760
I'll have these players play something
like the murder of my father

1:10:34.880 --> 1:10:36.520
before mine uncle.

1:10:38.480 --> 1:10:40.400
I'll observe his looks,

1:10:40.520 --> 1:10:42.320
I'll tent him to the quick.

1:10:42.440 --> 1:10:46.000
And if he do but blench, I know my course.

1:10:48.160 --> 1:10:51.040
Tis well, I'll have thee
speak out the rest soon.

1:10:51.160 --> 1:10:54.280
Good my lord, will you see
these players are well bestowed?

1:10:54.400 --> 1:10:55.800
And look they are well used,

1:10:55.920 --> 1:10:59.520
for they are the abstract
and brief chronicles of the time.

1:10:59.639 --> 1:11:02.600
My lord, I will use them
according to their desert.

1:11:02.719 --> 1:11:05.240
For God's sake man, better.

1:11:06.800 --> 1:11:09.639
Use every man after their desert
and who shall escape whipping?

1:11:10.440 --> 1:11:13.240
Use them after your own honour
and dignity. Take them in.

1:11:13.360 --> 1:11:14.960
Come, sirs.

1:11:16.280 --> 1:11:21.120
― Can you play The Murder of Gonzago ?
― The Murder of Gonzago ? Aye, my lord.

1:11:21.240 --> 1:11:22.600
We'll have it tonight.
You could, for my sake,

1:11:22.719 --> 1:11:25.160
study a speech of some dozen or 16 lines
which I would set down

1:11:25.280 --> 1:11:27.000
― and have inserted in it, could you not?
― Aye, my lord.

1:11:27.120 --> 1:11:29.960
Very well! Follow that lord,
and look you mock him not.

1:11:30.080 --> 1:11:32.440
My dear good friends
I'll leave you till tonight.

1:11:32.559 --> 1:11:35.639
― You are welcome to Elsinore.
― Good my lord.

1:11:35.760 --> 1:11:37.760
The play is the thing

1:11:37.880 --> 1:11:40.280
wherein I'll catch
the conscience of the king.

1:12:06.960 --> 1:12:12.680
(DRAMATICALLY) Oh villain, villain,
smiling damned villain!

1:12:12.800 --> 1:12:16.280
That a brother should be so perfidious...

1:12:18.639 --> 1:12:23.280
Speak the speech, I pray you,
as I pronounced it to you.

1:12:23.400 --> 1:12:24.960
[LAUGHTER]

1:12:25.080 --> 1:12:27.320
Trippingly on the tongue,

1:12:27.440 --> 1:12:29.480
for if you mouth it
as many of your players do

1:12:29.600 --> 1:12:32.280
I had as lief
the town crier had spoke my lines.

1:12:32.400 --> 1:12:38.040
Nor do not saw the air too much
with your hands, thus, but use all gently,

1:12:38.160 --> 1:12:41.600
for in the torrent, tempest and,
as I may say, whirlwind of passion,

1:12:41.719 --> 1:12:45.440
you must acquire and beget a temperance
that may give it smoothness.

1:12:45.559 --> 1:12:48.320
― I warrant your honour.
― Be not too tame neither.

1:12:49.360 --> 1:12:52.480
― Let your own discretion be your tutor.
― [LAUGHTER]

1:12:53.440 --> 1:12:57.360
Suit the action to the word,
the word to the action.

1:12:58.600 --> 1:13:03.360
With this special observance, that you
o'erstep not the modesty of nature,

1:13:03.480 --> 1:13:05.960
for anything so overdone
is from the purpose of playing

1:13:06.080 --> 1:13:07.360
whose end, both now and at the first,

1:13:07.480 --> 1:13:10.920
was and is
to hold the mirror up to nature...

1:13:12.040 --> 1:13:15.360
..to show virtue her own feature,
scorn her own image.

1:13:16.880 --> 1:13:21.000
The very age and body of the time,
his form and pressure.

1:13:22.080 --> 1:13:23.840
Oh, there be players
that I have seen play,

1:13:23.960 --> 1:13:25.800
and heard others praise, and that highly,

1:13:25.920 --> 1:13:30.160
which not to speak it profanely,
that have so strutted and bellowed

1:13:30.280 --> 1:13:33.480
that I have thought
that nature's apprentices had made men.

1:13:33.600 --> 1:13:36.800
And not made them well,
they imitated humanity so abominably.

1:13:36.920 --> 1:13:39.200
I hope we have reformed that
indifferently with us, sir.

1:13:39.320 --> 1:13:43.240
Go, make you ready. How now good friends,
will the king hear this piece of work?

1:13:43.360 --> 1:13:46.639
― And the queen too, and that presently.
― Bid the players make haste.

1:13:46.760 --> 1:13:49.760
― Will you two help to hasten them?
― We will, my lord.

1:13:51.400 --> 1:13:54.920
― Say, what? Is Horatio here?
― A piece of him.

1:13:55.040 --> 1:13:58.559
― How now, good friend! What news?
― Is it not very strange?

1:13:58.680 --> 1:14:01.240
Thine uncle is king of Denmark

1:14:01.360 --> 1:14:04.840
and those that would make mouths at him
while your father lived

1:14:04.960 --> 1:14:10.200
give 20, 40, 100 crowns apiece
for his picture in little.

1:14:10.880 --> 1:14:15.120
There is something in this more than
natural, if philosophy could find it out.

1:14:15.240 --> 1:14:20.080
Oh, Horatio, thou art as just a man
as ere my conversation coped withal.

1:14:20.200 --> 1:14:22.480
― Ah, my dear lord!
― Do not think I flatter thee.

1:14:22.600 --> 1:14:26.600
For what advancement may I hope from thee
that no revenue hast save thy good spirits

1:14:26.719 --> 1:14:28.040
to feed and clothe thee?

1:14:29.080 --> 1:14:32.559
Give me that man
that is not fortune's slave

1:14:32.680 --> 1:14:34.760
and I will wear him in my heart's core.

1:14:36.520 --> 1:14:40.520
Aye, my heart of hearts, as I do thee.

1:14:40.639 --> 1:14:42.320
Something too much of this.

1:14:42.440 --> 1:14:46.320
Something too much of this!
There is a play tonight before the king.

1:14:46.440 --> 1:14:48.000
One scene of it
comes near the circumstance

1:14:48.120 --> 1:14:50.639
which I have told thee
of my father's death.

1:14:50.760 --> 1:14:52.840
I pray thee,
when thou see'st that act afoot,

1:14:52.960 --> 1:14:55.559
even with the utmost shrewdness
of thine eyes,

1:14:55.680 --> 1:14:57.880
observe mine uncle.

1:14:58.000 --> 1:15:02.559
If his disguised guilt
do not itself unravel in one speech,

1:15:02.680 --> 1:15:06.360
it is a damned ghost that we have seen,
then give him heedful note...

1:15:06.480 --> 1:15:10.120
I will, my lord. If he steal aught whilst
this play is playing and scape detecting,

1:15:10.240 --> 1:15:11.840
I will pay the theft.

1:15:11.960 --> 1:15:14.600
They are coming to the play,
I must prepare.

1:15:14.719 --> 1:15:17.680
KING: And can you
by no drift of circumstance

1:15:17.800 --> 1:15:21.600
get from him
why he puts on this confusion,

1:15:21.719 --> 1:15:28.480
grating so harshly all our days of quiet
with turbulent and dangerous lunacy?

1:15:28.600 --> 1:15:31.400
He does confess
he feels himself distracted,

1:15:31.520 --> 1:15:34.520
but from what cause
he will by no means speak.

1:15:34.639 --> 1:15:37.440
Nor do we find him forward to be sounded.

1:15:37.559 --> 1:15:40.920
― Did he receive you well?
― Oh, most like a gentleman.

1:15:41.040 --> 1:15:44.920
Sparing of question,
but of our demands most free in his reply.

1:15:45.040 --> 1:15:48.200
Then with a crafty madness

1:15:48.320 --> 1:15:53.080
he keeps aloof when you would bring him on
to some confession of his true state.

1:15:53.200 --> 1:15:58.200
― Get you a place!
― How fares our gracious Hamlet?

1:15:58.320 --> 1:16:01.520
Excellent! Excellent well, in faith.

1:16:01.639 --> 1:16:06.120
Of the chameleon's dish:
I eat the air, promise-crammed.

1:16:07.000 --> 1:16:11.320
― You cannot feed capons so.
― I have nothing with this answer, Hamlet.

1:16:11.440 --> 1:16:14.320
― These words are not mine.
― No, nor mine now neither.

1:16:14.440 --> 1:16:17.639
Now, my good lord, you played once
at the university, you say?

1:16:17.760 --> 1:16:20.480
That I did my lord,
and was accounted a good actor.

1:16:21.200 --> 1:16:22.480
And what did you enact?

1:16:22.600 --> 1:16:25.680
I did enact Julius Caesar.
I was killed in the Capitol, Brutus...

1:16:25.800 --> 1:16:26.800
Be the players ready?

1:16:26.920 --> 1:16:28.840
Aye my lord, they stay upon your patience.

1:16:28.960 --> 1:16:31.559
Come hither,
my good Hamlet, come sit by me.

1:16:31.680 --> 1:16:34.520
No, good mother,
here's metal more attractive.

1:16:34.639 --> 1:16:36.760
Lady, shall I lie in your lap?

1:16:38.280 --> 1:16:39.600
No, my lord.

1:16:39.719 --> 1:16:41.600
I mean my head upon your lap?

1:16:42.880 --> 1:16:46.639
Did you think I meant country matters?

1:16:46.760 --> 1:16:48.120
(GASPS)

1:16:49.040 --> 1:16:50.639
I think nothing, my lord.

1:16:50.760 --> 1:16:52.400
There's a fair thought
to lie between a maid's legs.

1:16:52.520 --> 1:16:53.960
― What is, my lord?
― Nothing.

1:16:54.080 --> 1:16:56.800
― You are merry, my lord.
― What should a man do but be merry?

1:16:56.920 --> 1:16:59.880
Look you how cheerfully my mother looks,
when my father died within two hours.

1:17:00.880 --> 1:17:02.480
Nay, 'tis yet two months.

1:17:04.800 --> 1:17:07.840
So long? Oh, heavens(!)

1:17:07.960 --> 1:17:10.000
― [LAUGHTER]
― Died two months ago

1:17:10.120 --> 1:17:12.080
and not forgotten yet?

1:17:13.400 --> 1:17:18.040
Then there's hope a great man's memory
might outlive his life by half a year.

1:17:19.080 --> 1:17:22.440
You are naught. I'll mark the play.

1:17:35.320 --> 1:17:39.719
Full 30 times
hath Phoebus' cart gone round

1:17:39.840 --> 1:17:44.200
Neptune's salt wash
and Tellus' orbed ground

1:17:44.320 --> 1:17:49.040
since love our hearts
and Hymen did our hands

1:17:49.160 --> 1:17:53.160
unite comutual in most sacred bands.

1:17:53.280 --> 1:17:56.440
So many journeys may the sun and moon

1:17:56.559 --> 1:18:01.040
make us again count over
e'er love be done.

1:18:01.160 --> 1:18:04.320
But woe is me, you are so sick of late,

1:18:04.440 --> 1:18:08.120
so far from cheer
and from your former state.

1:18:08.240 --> 1:18:15.120
For women, fear and love hold quantity,
in neither aught or extremity.

1:18:15.240 --> 1:18:19.600
And what my love is
proof have made you know,

1:18:19.719 --> 1:18:23.880
thus as my love is sized, my fear is so.

1:18:24.000 --> 1:18:28.280
Faith, I must leave thee, love,
and shortly too.

1:18:28.400 --> 1:18:32.000
My operant powers
and functions leave to do.

1:18:32.120 --> 1:18:36.760
And thou must live
in this fair world behind,

1:18:36.880 --> 1:18:41.040
honoured, beloved and happily one as kind.

1:18:41.160 --> 1:18:43.280
For husband shalt thou...

1:18:43.400 --> 1:18:44.480
Oh confound the rest.

1:18:44.600 --> 1:18:47.960
Such love must needs be
treason in my breast.

1:18:48.080 --> 1:18:50.400
In second husband let me be accursed,

1:18:50.520 --> 1:18:52.680
none wed the second
but who killed the first.

1:18:52.800 --> 1:18:54.960
HAMLET: Wormwood! Wormwood!

1:18:55.080 --> 1:18:58.240
The instances that second marriage move

1:18:58.360 --> 1:19:02.040
are base respects of thrift,
but none of love.

1:19:02.160 --> 1:19:07.600
The second time I kill my husband dead
when second husband kisses me in bed.

1:19:07.719 --> 1:19:10.480
PLAYER KING: I do believe
you think now what you speak,

1:19:10.600 --> 1:19:13.920
but what we do determine oft we break.

1:19:14.040 --> 1:19:18.440
This world is not for aye,
nor 'tis not strange

1:19:18.559 --> 1:19:22.280
that even our loves
should with our fortunes change.

1:19:22.400 --> 1:19:25.840
For 'tis a question left us yet to prove

1:19:25.960 --> 1:19:31.480
whether love leads fortune,
or else fortune love.

1:19:31.600 --> 1:19:38.880
But orderly to end where I begun,
our wills and fates do so contrary run

1:19:39.000 --> 1:19:42.520
that our devices still are overthrown.

1:19:42.639 --> 1:19:47.719
Our thoughts are ours,
the ends none of our own.

1:19:48.440 --> 1:19:51.160
So think thou wilt no second husband wed,

1:19:51.280 --> 1:19:55.680
but die thy thoughts
when thy first lord is dead.

1:19:55.800 --> 1:19:58.719
Not Earth to give me food,
or heaven light,

1:19:58.840 --> 1:20:02.639
rest and repose lock me
from day and night.

1:20:02.760 --> 1:20:05.440
Each instrument that fouls the face of joy

1:20:05.559 --> 1:20:08.240
meet what I would have well
and it destroy.

1:20:08.360 --> 1:20:11.920
Both here and hence
pursue me lasting strife

1:20:12.040 --> 1:20:15.520
if once a widow ever I be wife.

1:20:15.639 --> 1:20:17.559
Oh! If she should break it now(!)

1:20:17.680 --> 1:20:19.080
[LAUGHTER]

1:20:19.760 --> 1:20:22.160
'Tis deeply sworn.

1:20:23.840 --> 1:20:27.360
Sweet, leave me here a while.

1:20:28.320 --> 1:20:30.920
My spirits grow dull

1:20:31.040 --> 1:20:35.240
and fain I would beguile
the tedious day with sleep.

1:20:35.360 --> 1:20:38.160
Sleep rock thy brain

1:20:38.280 --> 1:20:41.600
and never come mischance between us twain.

1:20:43.680 --> 1:20:45.639
Madam, how like you this play?

1:20:46.960 --> 1:20:50.320
The lady doth protest too much, methinks.

1:20:50.440 --> 1:20:52.240
Oh, but she'll keep her word.

1:20:52.360 --> 1:20:55.800
Have you heard the argument?
Is there no offence in it?

1:20:55.920 --> 1:21:00.680
No offence in the world.
It's the image of a murder done in Vienna.

1:21:00.800 --> 1:21:02.920
Gonzago is the duke's name,
Baptista his wife.

1:21:03.920 --> 1:21:06.240
You shall see anon,
'tis a knavish piece of work.

1:21:06.360 --> 1:21:07.360
But what of that?

1:21:07.480 --> 1:21:11.080
Your majesty and we that have free souls,
it touches us not.

1:21:11.200 --> 1:21:13.840
― What means this, my lord?
― This is one Lucianus,

1:21:13.960 --> 1:21:15.360
nephew to the king.

1:21:16.760 --> 1:21:18.680
Will you tell us what this means?

1:21:18.800 --> 1:21:20.520
This means mischief.

1:21:21.719 --> 1:21:27.200
Thoughts black, hands apt,
drugs fit and time agreeing.

1:21:27.320 --> 1:21:31.080
Confederate season,
else no creature seeing.

1:21:31.200 --> 1:21:35.559
Thou mixture rank
of midnight weeds collected,

1:21:35.680 --> 1:21:40.240
of witches' curse thrice blasted,
thrice infected,

1:21:40.360 --> 1:21:47.680
thy natural magic and dire property,
on wholesome life usurp immediately.

1:21:49.559 --> 1:21:54.240
PLAYER KING: Oh, villain, villain,
smiling damned villain. That a brother...

1:21:54.360 --> 1:21:56.760
HAMLET: He poisons him in the garden
for his estate.

1:21:56.880 --> 1:21:59.960
You shall see anon how the murderer
gets the love of the old man's wife.

1:22:00.080 --> 1:22:03.120
― The king rises.
― What, frighted with false fire?

1:22:03.240 --> 1:22:05.520
― QUEEN: How fares my lord?
― Give o'er the play!

1:22:05.639 --> 1:22:08.000
Give me some light!

1:22:08.120 --> 1:22:09.600
Away! Away!

1:22:10.920 --> 1:22:12.520
Would not this, sir,
and a forest of feathers,

1:22:12.639 --> 1:22:14.480
get me a cry in a fellowship of players?

1:22:14.600 --> 1:22:17.760
― Half a share.
― Ah, music! Come some music!

1:22:17.880 --> 1:22:19.800
― (MUSIC BEGINS)
― Oh, Horatio!

1:22:19.920 --> 1:22:22.680
I'll take the ghost's word
for a thousand pounds. Dids't perceive?

1:22:22.800 --> 1:22:24.920
― Very well, my lord.
― Upon the talk of poisoning?

1:22:25.040 --> 1:22:26.480
I did very well note him.

1:22:26.600 --> 1:22:29.440
Good my lord,
vouchsafe me a word with you.

1:22:29.559 --> 1:22:32.080
― A whole history, sir.
― The king, sir...

1:22:32.200 --> 1:22:33.280
Aye sir, what of him?

1:22:33.400 --> 1:22:36.600
..is in his retirement
marvellous distempered.

1:22:36.719 --> 1:22:40.719
― With drink, sir?
― No, my lord, rather with choler.

1:22:40.840 --> 1:22:44.520
Your wisdom would show itself the richer
to signify this to his doctor.

1:22:44.639 --> 1:22:47.000
Good my lord,
put your discourse into some frame

1:22:47.120 --> 1:22:49.320
and start not so wildly from my affair.

1:22:51.000 --> 1:22:54.440
― I am tame sir, pronounce.
― The queen, your mother,

1:22:54.559 --> 1:22:57.200
in most great affliction of spirit,
hath sent us to you.

1:22:57.320 --> 1:22:58.520
You're welcome.

1:22:59.600 --> 1:23:04.320
GILDENSTERN: Nay, this courtesy
is not of the right breed!

1:23:04.440 --> 1:23:08.160
If it shall please you
to make a wholesome answer,

1:23:08.280 --> 1:23:10.120
we will do your mother's commandment.

1:23:10.240 --> 1:23:13.880
If not, your pardon and our return
shall be the end of our business.

1:23:14.000 --> 1:23:15.440
― I cannot, sir.
― What, my lord?

1:23:15.559 --> 1:23:18.280
Make you a wholesome answer.
My wit's diseased.

1:23:18.400 --> 1:23:21.960
― But to the matter. You say my mother...?
― Then thus she says your behaviour

1:23:22.080 --> 1:23:24.160
hath struck her
into amazement and admiration.

1:23:24.280 --> 1:23:27.680
Oh wonderful son,
that can so astonish a mother!

1:23:27.800 --> 1:23:30.600
She desires to speak with you
in her closet ere you go to bed.

1:23:30.719 --> 1:23:32.920
We shall obey her
were she ten times our mother.

1:23:33.040 --> 1:23:35.559
Have you any further trade with us?

1:23:37.800 --> 1:23:41.000
My lord, you once did love me.

1:23:42.719 --> 1:23:46.800
And still do,
by these pickers and stealers.

1:23:46.920 --> 1:23:50.880
Good my lord,
what is your cause of distemper?

1:23:51.000 --> 1:23:52.760
Sir, I lack advancement.

1:23:52.880 --> 1:23:56.680
How can that be when you have
the voice of the king himself in Denmark?

1:23:58.920 --> 1:24:01.920
― Can you play upon this pipe?
― My lord, I cannot.

1:24:02.040 --> 1:24:04.120
― I pray you.
― Believe me, I cannot.

1:24:04.240 --> 1:24:06.719
― I beseech you.
― I know no touch of it, my lord.

1:24:06.840 --> 1:24:08.719
'Tis as easy as lying.

1:24:09.719 --> 1:24:11.400
Govern these ventages
with your fingers and thumbs,

1:24:11.520 --> 1:24:12.520
give it breath with your mouth

1:24:12.639 --> 1:24:16.040
and it will discourse most excellent
music. Look you, these are the stops.

1:24:16.160 --> 1:24:19.160
But these cannot I command
to any utterance of harmony,

1:24:19.280 --> 1:24:20.520
I have not the skill.

1:24:21.880 --> 1:24:26.760
Look you now,
how unworthy a thing you would make of me.

1:24:26.880 --> 1:24:29.920
You would play upon me,
you would seem to know my stops.

1:24:30.040 --> 1:24:33.200
You would sound me from my lowest note
to the top of my compass.

1:24:33.320 --> 1:24:36.040
Yet there is much music,
excellent voice in this little organ,

1:24:36.160 --> 1:24:37.800
yet cannot you make it speak?

1:24:39.880 --> 1:24:44.400
What, do you think I am easier
to be played on than a pipe?

1:24:48.840 --> 1:24:50.840
Call me what instrument you will,

1:24:50.960 --> 1:24:55.320
though you fret me,
you cannot play upon me.

1:25:00.160 --> 1:25:01.840
God bye you, sir.

1:25:01.960 --> 1:25:06.120
POLONIUS: My lord, the queen
would speak with you, and presently.

1:25:06.240 --> 1:25:11.040
Oh! Do you see yonder cloud?
It's almost in the shape of a camel!

1:25:11.160 --> 1:25:14.160
― It is indeed like a camel.
― Methinks it's like a weasel.

1:25:14.280 --> 1:25:16.840
― It is backed like a weasel.
― Or like a whale.

1:25:16.960 --> 1:25:18.920
It is very like a whale.

1:25:19.040 --> 1:25:20.719
[LAUGHTER]

1:25:20.840 --> 1:25:23.320
I come to my mother by and by.

1:25:25.760 --> 1:25:28.200
― By and by I come.
― I will say so.

1:25:28.320 --> 1:25:31.120
By and by is easily said!

1:25:32.320 --> 1:25:34.360
They fool me to the top of my bent.

1:25:35.559 --> 1:25:37.680
Leave me, friends.

1:25:44.120 --> 1:25:47.320
'Tis now the witching time of night...

1:25:48.400 --> 1:25:55.120
..when churchyards yawn and hell itself
breathes out contagion to the world.

1:25:55.240 --> 1:25:58.240
Now might I drink hot blood

1:25:58.360 --> 1:26:02.680
and do such bitter business
as the day would quake to look upon.

1:26:07.120 --> 1:26:09.160
Soft, now to my mother.

1:26:11.600 --> 1:26:14.360
Oh heart, lose not thy nature.

1:26:15.120 --> 1:26:17.840
Let not ever the soul of Nero
enter this firm bosom.

1:26:17.960 --> 1:26:20.040
Let me be cruel, but not unnatural.

1:26:20.160 --> 1:26:23.559
I will speak daggers to her, but use none.

1:26:30.480 --> 1:26:35.559
I like him not, nor stands it safe with us
to let his madness range.

1:26:35.680 --> 1:26:37.960
Therefore, prepare you.

1:26:38.080 --> 1:26:44.000
I your commission will forthwith dispatch
and he to England shall return with you.

1:26:45.280 --> 1:26:49.760
The terms of our estate
may not endure hazard so dangerous

1:26:49.880 --> 1:26:53.440
as doth hourly grow out of his lunacies.

1:26:53.559 --> 1:26:54.800
What think you on it?

1:26:57.320 --> 1:26:59.719
Most holy and religious fear it is

1:26:59.840 --> 1:27:05.040
to keep those many, many bodies safe
that live and feed upon your majesty.

1:27:05.160 --> 1:27:08.000
The cease of which,
my lord, dies not alone,

1:27:08.120 --> 1:27:11.120
but like a gulf
doth draw what's near it with it.

1:27:11.240 --> 1:27:15.559
Thus set it down,
he shall with speed to England.

1:27:15.680 --> 1:27:20.040
Perhaps the seas and countries different
with variable aspect

1:27:20.160 --> 1:27:25.639
shall expel this something settled matter
in his heart,

1:27:25.760 --> 1:27:28.559
whereon his brain still beating
puts him thus from fashion of himself.

1:27:28.680 --> 1:27:29.719
'Tis wisely spoke.

1:27:29.840 --> 1:27:32.880
Arm you, I pray you,
to this speedy voyage.

1:27:33.000 --> 1:27:36.440
For we will fetters put upon this fear

1:27:36.559 --> 1:27:39.240
that now goes too free-footed.

1:27:39.360 --> 1:27:41.639
We will ourselves provide.

1:27:41.760 --> 1:27:44.000
POLONIUS: My lord,
he's going to his mother's closet.

1:27:44.120 --> 1:27:47.480
Behind the arras I'll convey myself
to hear the process.

1:27:47.600 --> 1:27:51.320
'Tis meet that some more audience
than a mother,

1:27:51.440 --> 1:27:53.600
since nature makes them partial,

1:27:53.719 --> 1:27:56.480
should o'erhear the speech of vantage.

1:27:57.320 --> 1:28:01.200
Thanks...dear my lord.

1:28:05.920 --> 1:28:10.760
Oh, my offence is rank.

1:28:12.440 --> 1:28:15.960
It smells to heaven.

1:28:20.040 --> 1:28:24.559
It hath the primal eldest curse upon it...

1:28:25.360 --> 1:28:27.160
..a brother's murder.

1:28:30.960 --> 1:28:36.000
Pray can I not,
though inclination be as sharp as will.

1:28:36.120 --> 1:28:41.559
My stronger guilt defeats my strong intent

1:28:41.680 --> 1:28:44.960
and, like a man to double business bound,

1:28:45.080 --> 1:28:49.040
I stand in pause where
I should first begin,

1:28:49.160 --> 1:28:50.880
and both neglect.

1:28:52.960 --> 1:28:56.240
What if this cursed hand

1:28:56.360 --> 1:29:00.040
were thicker than itself
with brother's blood?

1:29:01.200 --> 1:29:04.559
Is there not rain enough
in the sweet heavens

1:29:04.680 --> 1:29:06.880
to wash it white as snow?

1:29:08.680 --> 1:29:13.719
Whereto serves mercy
but to confront the visage of offence?

1:29:13.840 --> 1:29:17.040
Then I look up. My fault is past.

1:29:17.840 --> 1:29:22.480
But oh, what form of prayer
can serve my turn?

1:29:22.600 --> 1:29:24.639
"Forgive me my foul murder"?

1:29:24.760 --> 1:29:25.880
That cannot be,

1:29:26.000 --> 1:29:29.080
since I am still possessed of those
effects for which I did the murder ―

1:29:29.200 --> 1:29:31.240
my crown,

1:29:31.360 --> 1:29:33.040
my own ambition

1:29:33.160 --> 1:29:34.840
and my queen.

1:29:36.639 --> 1:29:39.480
May one be pardoned
and retain the offence?

1:29:41.000 --> 1:29:43.880
In the corrupted currents of this world,

1:29:44.000 --> 1:29:47.680
offence's gilded hand
may shove by justice,

1:29:47.800 --> 1:29:52.840
and oft 'tis seen, the wicked prize itself
buys off the law...

1:29:53.800 --> 1:29:56.360
..but 'tis not so above.

1:29:57.840 --> 1:30:00.559
There is no shuffling,

1:30:00.680 --> 1:30:05.880
there the action lies in his true nature

1:30:06.000 --> 1:30:08.760
and we ourselves compelled,

1:30:08.880 --> 1:30:13.800
even to the teeth and forehead
of our faults

1:30:13.920 --> 1:30:15.719
to give in evidence.

1:30:17.760 --> 1:30:20.680
What then? What's left?

1:30:23.160 --> 1:30:26.639
Try what repentance can.
What can it not?

1:30:29.120 --> 1:30:34.760
Yet what can it,
when one cannot repent?

1:30:36.639 --> 1:30:38.920
Oh, wretched state!

1:30:39.719 --> 1:30:43.760
Oh, bosom black as death!

1:30:43.880 --> 1:30:48.920
Oh, limed soul, that struggling to be free
art more engaged!

1:30:49.639 --> 1:30:52.320
Help, angels...

1:30:53.680 --> 1:30:56.280
..make assay.

1:30:57.440 --> 1:30:59.840
Bow, stubborn knees,

1:30:59.960 --> 1:31:03.800
and heart with strings of steel,

1:31:03.920 --> 1:31:07.760
be soft as sinews of the new-born babe.

1:31:10.040 --> 1:31:12.200
All may be well.

1:31:19.639 --> 1:31:22.120
HAMLET: Now might I do it,
now he is praying.

1:31:25.320 --> 1:31:26.719
And now I'll do it,

1:31:26.840 --> 1:31:30.000
and so he goes to heaven
and so am I revenged.

1:31:32.960 --> 1:31:36.559
That would be scanned.
A villain kills my father.

1:31:36.680 --> 1:31:40.680
And for that I, his foul son,
do that same villain send to heaven?

1:31:41.719 --> 1:31:44.280
Oh, this is hire and salary, not revenge.

1:31:46.280 --> 1:31:49.600
He took my father grossly,

1:31:49.719 --> 1:31:55.440
full of bread, with all his crimes
broad blown as fresh as May.

1:31:55.559 --> 1:31:59.320
And how his audit stands,
who knows save heaven?

1:31:59.440 --> 1:32:03.360
But in our circumstance
and course of thought 'tis heavy with him.

1:32:05.680 --> 1:32:09.639
Am I then revenged
to take him in the purging of his soul,

1:32:09.760 --> 1:32:12.880
when he is fit and seasoned
for his passage?

1:32:15.000 --> 1:32:16.360
No.

1:32:21.520 --> 1:32:26.040
When he is drunk asleep or in his rage,

1:32:26.160 --> 1:32:29.120
or in the incestuous pleasure of his bed,

1:32:29.240 --> 1:32:34.559
at gaming, swearing or about some act
that hath no relish of salvation in it,

1:32:34.680 --> 1:32:38.719
then I'll trip him
that his heels may kick at heaven

1:32:38.840 --> 1:32:42.360
and his soul may be as black and damned
as hell whereto it goes.

1:32:44.400 --> 1:32:46.160
My mother stays.

1:32:46.280 --> 1:32:50.080
This physic but prolongs thy sickly days.

1:32:55.320 --> 1:32:58.280
My words fly up;

1:32:58.400 --> 1:33:01.440
my thoughts remain below.

1:33:04.760 --> 1:33:09.400
Words without thoughts never to heaven go.

1:33:16.559 --> 1:33:18.559
POLONIUS: Look you lay home to him.

1:33:18.680 --> 1:33:22.400
Tell him his pranks
have been too broad to bear

1:33:22.520 --> 1:33:28.280
and that your grace hath screened
and stood between much heat and him.

1:33:28.400 --> 1:33:32.719
Not for all the riches under heaven.
I pray you do not push me.

1:33:32.840 --> 1:33:34.320
― HAMLET: Mother!
― I hear him coming.

1:33:34.440 --> 1:33:36.639
― I will silence me even here.
― Mother!

1:33:36.760 --> 1:33:38.000
Pray you be round with him.

1:33:38.600 --> 1:33:39.920
Mother!

1:33:46.639 --> 1:33:49.400
Now, Mother, what's the matter?

1:33:49.520 --> 1:33:52.840
Hamlet, thou hast thy father
much offended.

1:33:52.960 --> 1:33:56.120
Mother, you have my father
much offended.

1:33:56.240 --> 1:33:58.120
Come come,
you answer with an idle tongue.

1:33:58.240 --> 1:34:00.400
Go go, you question
with a wicked tongue.

1:34:01.120 --> 1:34:04.440
― Have you forgot me?
― No, you are the queen,

1:34:04.559 --> 1:34:06.360
your husband's brother's wife

1:34:06.480 --> 1:34:08.719
and, would you were not so,
you are my mother.

1:34:08.840 --> 1:34:12.639
Nay, then I'll set those to you
that can speak.

1:34:13.280 --> 1:34:16.559
Come and sit you down. You go not.

1:34:16.680 --> 1:34:19.600
You shall not budge
till I set you up a glass

1:34:19.719 --> 1:34:22.960
wherein you may see
the inmost part of you.

1:34:23.080 --> 1:34:26.240
What wilt thou do?
Thou wilt not murder me?

1:34:26.360 --> 1:34:28.880
― Help, help!
― POLONIUS: What ho? Help!

1:34:29.000 --> 1:34:32.160
― How now, a rat?
― (POLONIUS CRIES OUT)

1:34:32.280 --> 1:34:36.080
― Oh me, what hast thou done?
― Nay I know not. Is it the king?

1:34:38.559 --> 1:34:40.800
HAMLET: Oh, God!

1:34:42.000 --> 1:34:44.719
What rash and bloody deed is this?

1:34:45.880 --> 1:34:47.200
A bloody deed.

1:34:47.320 --> 1:34:50.280
Almost as bad, good mother,
as kill a king and marry with his brother.

1:34:50.400 --> 1:34:53.840
― As kill a king?
― Aye lady, 'twas my word.

1:34:56.280 --> 1:35:01.960
Thou wretched, rash, intruding fool,
I took thee for thy better.

1:35:04.320 --> 1:35:05.600
HAMLET: Farewell.

1:35:08.360 --> 1:35:12.960
Leave wringing of your hands,
and let me wring your heart,

1:35:13.080 --> 1:35:15.960
for so I shall,
if it be made of penetrable stuff;

1:35:16.080 --> 1:35:19.719
if damned custom have not brazed it so

1:35:19.840 --> 1:35:22.480
that it is proof
and bulwark against sense.

1:35:22.600 --> 1:35:24.040
What have I done

1:35:24.160 --> 1:35:28.520
that thou darest wag thy tongue
in noise so rude against me?

1:35:28.639 --> 1:35:32.680
Such an act
as blurs the grace and blush of modesty,

1:35:32.800 --> 1:35:34.559
calls virtue hypocrite,

1:35:34.680 --> 1:35:38.840
makes marriage vows
as false as dicers' oaths.

1:35:38.960 --> 1:35:42.639
Ay me, what act that roars so loud
and thunders in the index?

1:35:42.760 --> 1:35:47.840
Look here upon this picture and on this,

1:35:47.960 --> 1:35:50.200
the counterfeit presentment
of two brothers.

1:35:50.320 --> 1:35:54.400
Now, see what a grace
was seated on his brow.

1:35:55.920 --> 1:36:00.080
Hyperion's curls,
the front of Jove himself,

1:36:00.200 --> 1:36:03.160
an eye like Mars to threaten or command,

1:36:03.280 --> 1:36:07.960
a station like the herald Mercury
new lighted on a heaven-kissing hill.

1:36:09.960 --> 1:36:16.240
A combination and a form indeed
where every god did seem to set its seal

1:36:16.360 --> 1:36:20.840
to give the world assurance of a man.

1:36:23.800 --> 1:36:27.680
This was your husband.
Look you now what follows.

1:36:27.800 --> 1:36:32.639
Here is your husband, like a mildewed ear
blasting his wholesome brother.

1:36:34.160 --> 1:36:36.760
Have you eyes?

1:36:37.840 --> 1:36:42.840
Could you from this fair mountain leave
to feed and batten on this moor?

1:36:42.960 --> 1:36:45.320
Have you eyes?

1:36:45.440 --> 1:36:50.320
You cannot call it love, for at your age
the heyday in the blood it's tame

1:36:50.440 --> 1:36:52.800
and humble and waits upon the judgement.

1:36:52.920 --> 1:36:56.160
And what judgement
would step from this to this?

1:36:57.000 --> 1:37:02.160
What devil was it that thus
hath cozened you at blind man's bluff?

1:37:07.080 --> 1:37:11.719
Oh shame...where is thy blush?

1:37:14.840 --> 1:37:20.280
Rebellious hell, if thou canst mutiny
in a matron's bones to flaming youth

1:37:20.400 --> 1:37:24.400
let virtue be as wax
and melt in her own fire.

1:37:24.520 --> 1:37:26.440
Oh, speak no more!

1:37:27.120 --> 1:37:31.120
Thou turn'st mine eyes into my very soul

1:37:31.240 --> 1:37:36.840
and there I see such black and grained
spots as will not leave their tinct.

1:37:38.920 --> 1:37:40.520
Nay.

1:37:41.719 --> 1:37:48.639
But to live in the rank sweat
of an enseamed bed,

1:37:48.760 --> 1:37:50.520
stewed in corruption,

1:37:50.639 --> 1:37:53.719
honeying and making love
over the nasty sty!

1:37:53.840 --> 1:37:55.600
Please speak to me no more,

1:37:55.719 --> 1:37:58.840
these words like daggers
enter in mine ears.

1:37:58.960 --> 1:38:02.600
― No more, sweet Hamlet.
― A murderer! A villain!

1:38:02.719 --> 1:38:06.840
A slave that is not the twentieth part
the worth of your preceding lord!

1:38:06.960 --> 1:38:09.200
A king of vices, a cutpurse of the
empire and the rule.

1:38:09.320 --> 1:38:10.320
Please, no more!

1:38:10.440 --> 1:38:13.680
― A king of shreds and patches...
― (RUMBLING)

1:38:16.080 --> 1:38:19.080
Hover o'er me with your wings,
you heavenly guards.

1:38:19.200 --> 1:38:21.760
What would you? Oh, say.

1:38:23.240 --> 1:38:27.160
Do you not come your tardy son to chide
that lapsed in time and passion

1:38:27.280 --> 1:38:30.840
lets go by the important acting
of your dread command.

1:38:32.719 --> 1:38:34.200
Speak!

1:38:34.320 --> 1:38:36.600
Do not forget.

1:38:37.680 --> 1:38:42.160
This visitation is but to whet
thy almost blunted purpose.

1:38:44.200 --> 1:38:47.880

Oh, step between her
and her fighting soul.

Speak to her, Hamlet.

1:38:59.200 --> 1:39:01.639
H-How is't with you, lady?

1:39:02.880 --> 1:39:06.120
Alas, how is't with you,

1:39:06.240 --> 1:39:10.080
that you do bend your eye on vacancy

1:39:10.200 --> 1:39:13.600
and with the incorporal air
do hold discourse?

1:39:14.480 --> 1:39:20.200
Gentle son, upon the heat and flame
of thy distemper

1:39:20.320 --> 1:39:22.559
sprinkle cool patience.

1:39:24.200 --> 1:39:27.280
― Whereon do you look?
― On him, on him.

1:39:28.160 --> 1:39:30.480
Look you how pale he glares.

1:39:30.600 --> 1:39:34.040
― Do not look upon me.
― To whom do you speak this?

1:39:34.160 --> 1:39:35.400
Do you see nothing there?

1:39:35.520 --> 1:39:38.960
No, nothing at all, yet all that is I see.

1:39:39.080 --> 1:39:41.840
― Nor did you nothing hear?
― No, nothing but ourselves.

1:39:41.960 --> 1:39:44.520
Why, look you, my father,
in his habit as he lived!

1:39:44.639 --> 1:39:45.639
Ssh!

1:39:45.760 --> 1:39:48.200
This is the very coinage of your brain.

1:39:48.880 --> 1:39:55.000
This bodiless creation
ecstasy is very cunning in.

1:39:55.120 --> 1:39:58.480
Ecstasy? My pulse as yours
doth temperately keep time

1:39:58.600 --> 1:40:00.000
and makes as healthful music.

1:40:00.120 --> 1:40:02.240
'Tis not madness that I have uttered.

1:40:02.360 --> 1:40:04.240
Put me to the test
and I some matter will repeat

1:40:04.360 --> 1:40:05.840
which madness would fly from.

1:40:05.960 --> 1:40:07.400
For love of grace...

1:40:08.600 --> 1:40:11.440
..lay not a flattering unction
unto your soul

1:40:11.559 --> 1:40:15.520
that not your trespass
but my madness speaks.

1:40:17.559 --> 1:40:21.360
It will but film and skin
the ulcerous place,

1:40:21.480 --> 1:40:26.559
whilst rank corruption, mining all within,
infects unseen.

1:40:26.680 --> 1:40:27.880
Oh, Hamlet...

1:40:29.040 --> 1:40:32.480
..thou hast cleft my heart in twain.

1:40:32.600 --> 1:40:37.960
Then throw away the worser part of it
and live the purer with the other half.

1:40:38.080 --> 1:40:41.080
Repent what is past, avoid what is to come

1:40:41.200 --> 1:40:44.280
and do not spread the compost
on the weeds to make them ranker.

1:40:44.400 --> 1:40:47.120
Pray you, go not to my uncle's bed.

1:40:48.200 --> 1:40:49.920
Assume a virtue if you have it not.

1:40:50.040 --> 1:40:52.200
Refrain tonight,
and that shall lend a kind of easiness

1:40:52.320 --> 1:40:55.080
to the next abstinence,
the next more easy.

1:40:55.200 --> 1:40:57.880
Oh me, what have I done?

1:40:58.000 --> 1:40:59.840
(SHE SOBS)

1:41:02.080 --> 1:41:05.880
I must be cruel only to be kind.

1:41:06.920 --> 1:41:09.920
Thus bad begins and worse remains behind.

1:41:10.040 --> 1:41:15.200
And when thou art desirous to be blessed,
I will blessings beg of you.

1:41:16.360 --> 1:41:18.240
For this same lord I do repent me

1:41:18.360 --> 1:41:21.639
but hell hath deemed it so
to punish me with this and this with me.

1:41:25.280 --> 1:41:26.920
What shall I do?

1:41:29.040 --> 1:41:32.080
Do not let the bloat king
tempt you again to bed,

pinch wanton on your cheek,
call you his mouse,

1:41:35.000 --> 1:41:36.680
or for a pair of reechy kisses,

1:41:36.800 --> 1:41:40.120
or by paddling in your neck
with his damned fingers

1:41:40.240 --> 1:41:43.680
force you to ravel all this matter out.

1:41:43.800 --> 1:41:48.520
That I, essentially, am not in madness,

1:41:48.639 --> 1:41:51.120
but mad in craft.

1:41:53.719 --> 1:41:55.840
Be thou assured,

1:41:55.960 --> 1:42:00.280
if words be made of breath
and breath of life,

1:42:00.400 --> 1:42:03.800
I have no life to breathe

1:42:08.400 --> 1:42:10.040
HAMLET: Oh!

1:42:10.960 --> 1:42:14.240
I'll lug the guts into the neighbour room.
Mother, good night.

1:42:15.880 --> 1:42:21.320
Indeed this counsellor is now most still,
most secret and most grave,

1:42:21.440 --> 1:42:24.600
who was in life a foolish prating knave.

1:42:24.719 --> 1:42:25.840
Come, sir.

1:42:43.520 --> 1:42:44.960
How does Hamlet?

1:42:46.400 --> 1:42:52.320
Mad as the seas and winds
that do contend which is the mightier.

1:42:53.760 --> 1:42:57.040
In his lawless fit,

1:42:57.160 --> 1:43:01.960
behind the arras hearing something stir,

1:43:02.080 --> 1:43:06.120
he whips his rapier out,
he cries, "A rat, a rat!"

1:43:06.240 --> 1:43:12.200
And in his frantic apprehension
kills the unseen good old man.

1:43:12.320 --> 1:43:14.600
Oh, heavy deed.

1:43:16.080 --> 1:43:20.360
It had been so with us, had we been there.

1:43:22.080 --> 1:43:28.639
His liberty is full of threats to all,
to you yourself, to us, to everyone.

1:43:28.760 --> 1:43:32.600
And, pray,
how shall this deed be understood?

1:43:33.719 --> 1:43:35.920
It will be laid to us,

1:43:36.040 --> 1:43:39.280

should have kept short, restrained

1:43:39.400 --> 1:43:42.120
and out of haunt this mad young man.

1:43:43.480 --> 1:43:47.280
But so much was our love,
we would not understand what was most fit,

1:43:47.400 --> 1:43:49.520
but like the owner of a foul disease,

1:43:49.639 --> 1:43:53.880
to keep it from divulging,
lets it feed even on the pith of life.

1:43:54.920 --> 1:43:59.280
― Where is he gone?
― To draw apart the body he hath killed.

1:43:59.400 --> 1:44:03.160
― (SHOUTS) I pray you now, attend me!
― He weeps for what is done.

1:44:03.280 --> 1:44:06.639
The sun no sooner
shall the mountains touch

1:44:06.760 --> 1:44:08.559
but we will ship him hence,

1:44:08.680 --> 1:44:11.080
and this vile deed we must,

1:44:11.200 --> 1:44:16.000
with all our majesty and skill,
both countenance and excuse.

bring the body into the chapel.

and what's untimely done.

Tell us where 'tis,
that we may take it thence.

1:45:10.920 --> 1:45:14.400
― Ha-ha! Do not believe it.
― Believe what?

1:45:14.520 --> 1:45:17.080
That you could keep your secrets
and not my own.

1:45:17.200 --> 1:45:21.160

Aye, sir, soaks up the king's countenance,
his rewards, his authorities,

1:45:32.480 --> 1:45:36.320
but such officers
do the king best service in the end.

1:45:36.440 --> 1:45:40.680
When he needs what you have gleaned,
he will but squeeze you

1:45:40.800 --> 1:45:45.600
― and sponge, you shall be dry again.
― I understand you not, my lord.

A knavish speech sleeps in a foolish ear.

where the body is

1:45:52.280 --> 1:45:53.760
and go with us to the king.

1:45:55.040 --> 1:45:57.800
― The king is a thing.
― A thing, my lord?

but their eyes.

At supper? Where?

why to a public count I might not go

2:10:02.480 --> 2:10:06.240
is the great love
the common crowd do bear him

2:10:06.360 --> 2:10:08.040
who, dipping all his faults
in their affections,

2:10:08.160 --> 2:10:10.600
convert his sins to graces.

2:10:10.720 --> 2:10:15.920
So that my arrows,
too slightly timbered for so loud a wind

2:10:16.040 --> 2:10:20.040
would have reverted to my bow again
and not where I had aimed them.

2:10:20.640 --> 2:10:23.640
And so have I a noble father lost,

2:10:23.760 --> 2:10:29.880
a sister driven into desperate terms
who had, if praises may go back again,

2:10:30.000 --> 2:10:34.000
stood challenger on mount of all the age
for her perfections.

2:10:34.120 --> 2:10:36.040
But my revenge will come.

2:10:36.160 --> 2:10:39.880
Break not your sleep for that.

2:10:40.920 --> 2:10:44.840
You must not think that we are made
of stuff so flat and dull

2:10:44.960 --> 2:10:49.640
that we will let our state
be shook with danger and call it pastime.

2:10:49.760 --> 2:10:52.480
― How now, what news?
― Letters, my lord.

2:10:54.720 --> 2:10:55.920
From Hamlet.

2:10:58.480 --> 2:11:00.240
Who brought them?

2:11:00.360 --> 2:11:03.040
I saw them not, they were given to me
by Matthius, he received them.

2:11:03.160 --> 2:11:05.920
Laertes, you shall hear them.
Leave us.

2:11:07.640 --> 2:11:14.080
"High and mighty, you should know
I am set naked on your kingdom.

2:11:14.200 --> 2:11:17.320
"Tomorrow shall I beg
to see your kingly eyes

2:11:17.440 --> 2:11:18.560
"when I shall recount the occasion

2:11:18.680 --> 2:11:22.560
"of my sudden
and most strange return. Hamlet."

2:11:22.680 --> 2:11:24.600
How should this be?

2:11:26.600 --> 2:11:32.280
Are all the rest come back?
Or is this some abuse and no such thing?

2:11:33.120 --> 2:11:34.680
Let him come.

2:11:36.080 --> 2:11:39.160
It warms the very sickness in my heart

2:11:39.280 --> 2:11:44.360
that I shall live and tell him
to his teeth, "Thus diest thou!"

2:11:44.480 --> 2:11:49.400
If it be so! Yet how should it be so?

2:11:50.400 --> 2:11:51.480
How otherwise?

2:11:51.600 --> 2:11:53.880
Will you be ruled by me?

2:11:54.000 --> 2:11:58.960
― If you'll not o'errule me to a peace.
― Laertes, was your father dear to you?

2:11:59.080 --> 2:12:03.120
Or are you like the painting of a sorrow,
a face without a heart?

2:12:03.240 --> 2:12:05.400
― Why ask you this?
― Hamlet returns.

2:12:05.520 --> 2:12:08.720
What would you undertake to make yourself
your father's son

2:12:08.840 --> 2:12:10.480
in deed more than in word?

2:12:10.600 --> 2:12:15.600
To cut his throat in a church.

2:12:16.320 --> 2:12:20.840
No place indeed should murder sanctuarize.

2:12:20.960 --> 2:12:23.640
Revenge should know no bounds.

2:12:23.760 --> 2:12:25.800
So let me work him.

2:12:25.920 --> 2:12:29.000
An exploit is there ripe in my device,

2:12:29.120 --> 2:12:32.080
under the which
he shall not choose but fall,

2:12:32.200 --> 2:12:35.320
and for his death
no wind of blame shall breathe.

2:12:35.440 --> 2:12:39.880
But even his mother shall uncharge
the practice and call it accident.

2:12:43.520 --> 2:12:46.600
How now, sweet queen.

2:12:48.720 --> 2:12:53.320
One woe doth tread upon another's heels,

2:12:53.440 --> 2:12:55.800
so fast they follow.

2:13:06.720 --> 2:13:10.440
Your sister's drowned, Laertes.

2:13:11.920 --> 2:13:13.640
Drowned, how?

2:13:18.560 --> 2:13:23.960
There is a willow grows aslant a brook...

2:13:25.120 --> 2:13:29.640
..that shows his pale leaves
in the glassy stream.

2:13:30.880 --> 2:13:35.480
There with fantastic garlands

2:13:35.600 --> 2:13:37.240
did she come...

2:13:37.920 --> 2:13:42.040
..of crow-flowers, nettles,

2:13:42.160 --> 2:13:45.920
daisies and long purples.

2:13:46.720 --> 2:13:49.880
There on the pendant boughs,

2:13:50.000 --> 2:13:53.400
her coronet weeds clambering to hang...

2:13:54.560 --> 2:13:57.840
..an envious sliver broke...

2:13:59.600 --> 2:14:05.680
..and down her weedy trophies and herself
fell in the weeping brook.

2:14:06.960 --> 2:14:10.200
But her clothes spread wide...

2:14:11.320 --> 2:14:16.240
..and mermaid-like
a while they bore her up.

2:14:16.360 --> 2:14:18.320
Which time she...

2:14:19.200 --> 2:14:22.600
..chanted snatches of old tunes.

2:14:25.320 --> 2:14:28.760
As one insensible of her own distress,

2:14:28.880 --> 2:14:32.760
or like a creature native...

2:14:33.680 --> 2:14:36.160
..and inured unto that element.

2:14:37.720 --> 2:14:41.600
But long it could not be
till that her garments,

2:14:41.720 --> 2:14:44.080
heavy with their drink,

2:14:44.200 --> 2:14:48.800
pulled the poor wretch
from her melodious lay...

2:14:48.920 --> 2:14:49.960
to...

2:14:51.000 --> 2:14:54.000
..muddy death.

2:14:57.600 --> 2:15:02.840
Too much of water hast thou, poor Ophelia,
and therefore I forbid my tears,

2:15:02.960 --> 2:15:05.400
but yet it is our trick.

2:15:05.520 --> 2:15:09.080
Nature her custom holds,
let shame say what it will.

2:15:09.200 --> 2:15:11.880
Adieu, my lord.

2:15:12.000 --> 2:15:14.920
I have a speech of fire
that fain would blaze,

2:15:15.040 --> 2:15:17.680
but that this folly damps it.

2:15:17.800 --> 2:15:19.960
(FOOTSTEPS RUN AWAY)

2:15:20.080 --> 2:15:25.320
How much I had to do to calm his rage!

2:15:26.320 --> 2:15:29.880
Now fear I this will give it start again,

2:15:30.000 --> 2:15:32.640
therefore let's follow.

2:15:43.040 --> 2:15:46.320
But they knew what they did,
I was to do a good turn for them.

2:15:46.440 --> 2:15:49.040
― And Rosencrantz and Guildenstern?
― Hold their course for England.

2:15:49.160 --> 2:15:51.760
Of them I have much to tell thee.
Wilt hear the circumstance?

2:15:51.880 --> 2:15:53.320
― Aye, my lord.
― Upon that first night,

2:15:53.440 --> 2:15:57.720
before my capture, I lay my weary spirit
down abed, but in my heart

2:15:57.840 --> 2:16:01.160
there was a kind of fighting
that would not let me sleep.

2:16:01.280 --> 2:16:04.160
Rashly, and praised be rashness for it,

2:16:04.280 --> 2:16:08.880
let us know our indiscretions
sometimes serve us well.

2:16:09.000 --> 2:16:12.400
There's a divinity that shapes our ends,
rough-hew them how we will.

2:16:12.520 --> 2:16:14.520
― That is most certain.
― Up from my cabin,

2:16:14.640 --> 2:16:19.120
a blanket scarfed about me in the dark,
groped I to find them out, had my desire,

2:16:19.240 --> 2:16:22.040
fingered their warrant and, in fine,
withdrew to mine own cabin again

2:16:22.160 --> 2:16:25.280
making so bold,
my fears forgetting manners,

2:16:25.400 --> 2:16:27.880
to unseal their grand commission.

2:16:28.000 --> 2:16:29.600
Where I found, Horatio...

2:16:30.640 --> 2:16:32.760
..oh royal knavery!

2:16:32.880 --> 2:16:37.240
An exact command,
larded with many several sorts of reasons,

2:16:37.360 --> 2:16:40.560
importing Denmark's health
and England's too,

2:16:40.680 --> 2:16:44.400
to hasten now the grinding of the axe.

2:16:44.520 --> 2:16:46.799
My head should be struck off.

2:16:46.920 --> 2:16:49.279
― Is it possible?
― Here is the commission.

2:16:49.400 --> 2:16:50.920
Read it at thy leisure.

2:16:51.040 --> 2:16:53.959
― But wilt thou hear me how I did proceed?
― I beseech you.

2:16:54.080 --> 2:16:57.680
I sat me down, devised a new commission,
wrote it fair.

2:16:57.799 --> 2:17:00.680
I once did hold it a baseness
to write fair

2:17:00.799 --> 2:17:02.720
and laboured much
how to forget that learning.

2:17:02.840 --> 2:17:05.040
Oh, but now it did me faithful service.

2:17:05.160 --> 2:17:06.600
Wilt thou know the effects
of what I wrote?

2:17:06.720 --> 2:17:09.040
― Aye, my good lord.
― An earnest conjuration from the king.

2:17:09.160 --> 2:17:13.600
That on the know and view of the contents
he should the bearers put to sudden death.

2:17:13.720 --> 2:17:16.680
― No shriving time allowed.
― How was this sealed?

2:17:16.799 --> 2:17:20.680
Why, even that was heavenly ordained.
I had my father's signet in my purse.

2:17:20.799 --> 2:17:23.760
I folded up the writ in form of the other,
placed it safely back,

2:17:23.880 --> 2:17:25.840
the changeling never known.

2:17:25.959 --> 2:17:27.360
The next day was our sea fight.

2:17:27.480 --> 2:17:29.880
What was to this sequent
thou knowest already.

2:17:33.200 --> 2:17:36.639
Who comes here?
Repair my lord, withdraw us a while.

2:17:40.400 --> 2:17:46.320
Is she to be buried in Christian burial
that wilfully seeks her own salvation?

2:17:46.439 --> 2:17:48.119
I tell thee she is.

2:17:48.240 --> 2:17:51.520
The coroner hath sat on it
and finds it Christian burial.

2:17:51.639 --> 2:17:53.439
How can that be,

2:17:53.560 --> 2:17:56.320
unless she drowned herself
in her own defence?

2:17:56.439 --> 2:17:57.959
[AUDIENCE LAUGHS]

2:17:58.080 --> 2:18:01.760
― Why, 'tis found so.
― Give me leave.

2:18:01.880 --> 2:18:06.480
Here lies the water.
Here stands the man.

2:18:06.600 --> 2:18:11.400
If the water come to him and drown him,
he drowns not himself.

2:18:11.520 --> 2:18:15.160
But if the man go to the water

2:18:15.279 --> 2:18:18.320
and drown himself, he goes.

2:18:18.439 --> 2:18:21.200
― Mark you that.
― Will you have the truth of it?

2:18:22.240 --> 2:18:24.119
If this were not a gentlewoman,

2:18:24.240 --> 2:18:26.760
she should have been buried
out of Christian burial.

2:18:26.880 --> 2:18:29.160
Why, there thou sayest.

2:18:29.279 --> 2:18:32.560
And the more pity that great folk
should have countenance in this world

2:18:32.680 --> 2:18:35.959
to drown or hang themselves
more than their fellow Christian.

2:18:36.080 --> 2:18:42.080
There is no proper gentlemen
but gardeners, ditchers and grave-makers.

2:18:42.200 --> 2:18:45.400
― They hold up Adam's profession.
― Was he a gentleman?

2:18:45.520 --> 2:18:50.439
― He was, the first that ever bore arms.
― Why, he had none.

2:18:50.560 --> 2:18:55.520
What, art thou a heathen?
How doth thou understand the scripture?

2:18:55.639 --> 2:18:59.360
The scripture says, "Adam digged."

2:18:59.480 --> 2:19:01.720
Could he dig without arms?

2:19:01.840 --> 2:19:03.760
[LAUGHTER]

2:19:03.880 --> 2:19:06.200
I'll put another question to thee.

2:19:06.320 --> 2:19:08.439
What is he that builds stronger

2:19:08.560 --> 2:19:12.480
than either the mason,
the shipwright or the carpenter?

2:19:13.439 --> 2:19:17.160
The gallows-maker, for that frame
outlives a thousand tenants.

2:19:17.279 --> 2:19:19.959
I like thy wit well, in good faith.

2:19:20.080 --> 2:19:21.920
(HE CHUCKLES)
The gallows does well.

2:19:22.040 --> 2:19:24.400
But to it again, come.

2:19:24.520 --> 2:19:26.920
Who builds stronger than the mason,
the shipwright or the carpenter?

2:19:27.040 --> 2:19:29.360
― Aye, tell me that.
― Marry now, I can tell.

2:19:29.480 --> 2:19:30.639
To it, then!

2:19:32.920 --> 2:19:36.959
― Mass, I cannot tell.
― Cudgel thy brains no more about it.

2:19:37.080 --> 2:19:40.080
And when you're asked this question next,

2:19:40.200 --> 2:19:42.279
say a grave-maker.

2:19:42.400 --> 2:19:45.520
The houses he makes last till doomsday.

― Whose grave is this, sir?
― Mine, sir.

2:20:55.200 --> 2:20:58.760
― No, what man dost thou dig it for?
― For no man, sir.

― What woman, then?
― For none neither.

2:21:00.920 --> 2:21:03.880

But, God rest her soul, she's dead.

How long hast thou been a grave-maker?

2:21:11.480 --> 2:21:13.439
Of all the days in the year,

2:21:13.560 --> 2:21:17.320
I came to it that day that our last
King Hamlet o'ercame Fortinbras.

2:21:17.439 --> 2:21:20.000
― How long is that since?
― Cannot you tell that?

2:21:20.119 --> 2:21:21.960
Every fool can tell that.

2:21:22.080 --> 2:21:25.400
That was the very day
that young Hamlet was born,

2:21:25.520 --> 2:21:27.680
he that was mad and sent into England.

2:21:29.360 --> 2:21:33.840
― Marry, why was he sent to England?
― Because he was mad.

2:21:35.040 --> 2:21:38.960
He'll recover his wits there,
or if he do not, 'tis no great matter.

2:21:39.080 --> 2:21:41.400
― Why?
― Twill not be seen in him.

2:21:41.520 --> 2:21:43.119
There the men are as mad as he.

2:21:43.240 --> 2:21:44.520
[LAUGHTER]

2:21:44.640 --> 2:21:47.880
― How came he mad?
― Very strangely, they say.

2:21:48.000 --> 2:21:52.439
― How strangely? Upon what ground?
― Why, here in Denmark.

2:21:52.560 --> 2:21:54.600

he will last you some eight year
or nine year.

― A tanner will last you nine year.
― Why he more than another?

Why, sir, his hide is so tanned
with his trade

2:22:18.720 --> 2:22:21.400
that he will keep out water a great deal.

2:22:21.520 --> 2:22:25.720
And your water is a sore decayer
of your whoreson dead body.

2:22:25.840 --> 2:22:27.080
Now...

2:22:28.840 --> 2:22:31.520
..here's a skull has lain in the earth

2:22:31.640 --> 2:22:33.400
three and twenty years.

2:22:33.520 --> 2:22:36.560
― Whose was it?
― A whoreson mad fellow's it was.

2:22:36.680 --> 2:22:39.240
He poured
a flagon of rhenish on me head once.

2:22:39.360 --> 2:22:42.840
This same skull, sir, was Yorick's skull,

2:22:42.960 --> 2:22:44.480
the king's jester.

2:22:44.600 --> 2:22:46.560
― This? Let me see.
― Even that.

2:22:51.760 --> 2:22:53.160
Alas!

2:22:54.400 --> 2:22:55.800
Poor Yorick!

2:22:56.520 --> 2:22:58.760
I knew him, Horatio.

2:23:00.200 --> 2:23:02.640
He was a fellow of infinite jest...

2:23:03.960 --> 2:23:05.680
..of most excellent fancy.

2:23:07.160 --> 2:23:09.680
He hath borne me on his back
a thousand times

2:23:09.800 --> 2:23:12.480
and here hung those lips
I've kissed I know not how oft.

2:23:14.960 --> 2:23:19.400
How abhorred my imagination is,
my gorge rises at it.

2:23:23.520 --> 2:23:25.760
Where be your gibes now...

2:23:27.800 --> 2:23:30.000
..your gambols, your songs?

2:23:31.760 --> 2:23:35.720
Your flashes of merriment
that were wont to set the table on a roar?

2:23:37.840 --> 2:23:40.880
― No one now to mock your own grinning?
― (SOLEMN DRUMBEAT)

2:23:41.000 --> 2:23:45.760
But soft, but soft, aside.
Here comes the king, the queen and court.

2:23:45.880 --> 2:23:48.760
Who is it that they follow?
And with such maimed rites?

2:23:48.880 --> 2:23:50.840
This doth betoken the corpse they follow

2:23:50.960 --> 2:23:53.640
did with a desperate hand
foredo its own life.

2:23:53.760 --> 2:23:56.960
'Twas some estate.
Couch we a while and mark.

2:24:23.439 --> 2:24:24.960
LAERTES: What ceremony else?

2:24:25.080 --> 2:24:27.720
HAMLET: That is Laertes.
What makes him from France?

2:24:27.840 --> 2:24:29.320
LAERTES: What ceremony else?

2:24:30.119 --> 2:24:34.279
Her obsequies have been as far enlarged
as we have warrants.

2:24:34.400 --> 2:24:36.560
Her death was doubtful

2:24:36.680 --> 2:24:39.200
and, but that great command
o'ersways the order,

2:24:39.320 --> 2:24:44.400
she should in ground unsanctified
have lodged till the last trumpet.

2:24:44.520 --> 2:24:48.640
For charitable prayer, shards, flints
and pebbles should be thrown on her,

2:24:48.760 --> 2:24:53.840
yet here she is allowed her virgin rites,
her maiden strewments,

2:24:53.960 --> 2:24:56.400
and the bringing home of bell and burial.

2:24:56.520 --> 2:24:59.840
― Must there no more be done?
― No more be done.

2:25:01.560 --> 2:25:04.960
We should profane the service of the dead
to sing sage requiem

2:25:05.080 --> 2:25:07.720
and such peace as to peace-parted souls.

2:25:09.560 --> 2:25:10.880
Lay her in the earth.

2:25:14.360 --> 2:25:18.520
LAERTES: And from your fair
and unpolluted flesh

2:25:18.640 --> 2:25:20.360
may violets spring.

2:25:21.439 --> 2:25:23.400
I tell thee, churlish priest,

2:25:23.520 --> 2:25:29.160
a ministering angel shall my sister be
when thou liest howling!

2:25:29.279 --> 2:25:32.000
HAMLET: What, the fair Ophelia?

2:25:32.880 --> 2:25:36.080
Sweets to the sweet.

2:25:38.960 --> 2:25:40.640
Farewell.

2:25:43.320 --> 2:25:46.400
I hoped thou wouldst have been
my Hamlet's wife.

2:25:47.600 --> 2:25:51.920
I thought thy bride-bed to have decked,
sweet maid,

2:25:52.040 --> 2:25:54.000
and not to have strewn thy grave.

2:25:54.119 --> 2:25:58.680
Hold off the earth a while till I have
caught her once more in mine arms.

2:25:58.800 --> 2:26:00.119
(QUEEN GASPS)

2:26:00.240 --> 2:26:04.600
Now pile your dust
upon the quick and the dead

2:26:04.720 --> 2:26:09.000
till of this flat a mountain
you have made to o'ertop Olympus.

2:26:09.119 --> 2:26:13.240
Oh, woe is he whose grief
bears such an emphasis,

2:26:13.360 --> 2:26:16.600
whose phrase of sorrow
conjures the wandering stars

2:26:16.720 --> 2:26:20.200
and makes them stand
like wonder-wounded hearers.

2:26:21.320 --> 2:26:23.680
This is I, Hamlet the Dane.

2:26:23.800 --> 2:26:25.200
The devil take thy soul.

2:26:25.320 --> 2:26:29.080
― Pluck them asunder!
― Good my lord!

2:26:29.200 --> 2:26:32.680
Why, I will fight with him
upon this ground

2:26:32.800 --> 2:26:35.080
until my eyelids will no longer wag.

2:26:35.200 --> 2:26:36.960
I loved Ophelia!

2:26:37.439 --> 2:26:42.760
40,000 brothers could not with all
their quantity of love make up my sum.

2:26:42.880 --> 2:26:46.720
― Oh, he is mad, Laertes.
― What would thou do for her?

2:26:46.840 --> 2:26:49.600
― For love of God, forebear him!
― Woo't weep? Woo't fight?

2:26:49.720 --> 2:26:51.200
Woo't tear thyself?

2:26:51.320 --> 2:26:53.800
Drink of poison, eat a crocodile?

2:26:53.920 --> 2:26:55.360
I'll do it.

2:26:55.480 --> 2:26:58.320
What? Be buried quick with her,
then so will I!

2:26:58.439 --> 2:26:59.920
If thou talk of mountains,

2:27:00.040 --> 2:27:02.360
let them throw
millions of acres of earth on us

2:27:02.480 --> 2:27:06.040
till the ground, singeing his head
against the burning sun,

2:27:06.160 --> 2:27:08.960
make Ossa like a wart!

2:27:10.600 --> 2:27:14.200
Nay if thou'lt mouth
I'll rant as well as thou.

2:27:14.320 --> 2:27:19.160
This is mere madness, and thus awhile
the fit will work upon him.

2:27:19.279 --> 2:27:24.040
Hear you, sir, what is the reason
that you use me thus?

2:27:25.520 --> 2:27:27.439
I loved you ever.

2:27:37.560 --> 2:27:39.560
No such matter.

2:27:40.760 --> 2:27:44.119
Let Hercules himself do what he may,

2:27:44.240 --> 2:27:46.080
the cat will mew

2:27:46.200 --> 2:27:49.160
and dog will have his day.

2:27:51.640 --> 2:27:55.600
KING: Now Gertrude,
set some watch over your son.

2:27:57.160 --> 2:27:58.480
Away.

2:28:00.360 --> 2:28:04.880
Strengthen your patience
in our last night's speech.

2:28:05.000 --> 2:28:06.480
We put the matter to the present push.

2:28:06.600 --> 2:28:09.600
O, speak of that,
that do I long to hear.

2:28:09.720 --> 2:28:12.000
You have been talked of
since your travel much,

2:28:12.119 --> 2:28:13.520
and that in Hamlet's hearing,

2:28:13.640 --> 2:28:17.320
for a quality wherein they say you shine,
for art and exercise in your defence,

2:28:17.439 --> 2:28:20.520
and for your rapier most especially.

2:28:20.640 --> 2:28:22.680
Will you do this,
keep close within your chamber?

2:28:22.800 --> 2:28:25.439
We'll put on those
shall praise your excellence,

2:28:25.560 --> 2:28:28.360
bring you in trial together
and wager on your heads.

2:28:28.480 --> 2:28:33.400
He, being remiss and free from
all contriving, will not peruse the foils.

2:28:33.520 --> 2:28:35.360
So that with ease,

2:28:35.480 --> 2:28:39.119
or with a little shuffling,
you may choose a sword unbated

2:28:39.240 --> 2:28:42.320
and in a pass of practice
requite him for your sister.

2:28:42.439 --> 2:28:47.520
I will do it,
and for that purpose I'll anoint my sword.

2:28:47.640 --> 2:28:51.119
I bought an unction of a mountebank
so mortal that but dip a knife in it,

2:28:51.240 --> 2:28:52.800
where it draws blood,

2:28:52.920 --> 2:28:56.119
no application on Earth
can save the thing from death

2:28:56.240 --> 2:28:58.240
that is but scratched withal.

2:28:58.360 --> 2:29:00.880
I'll touch my point with this contagion,

2:29:01.000 --> 2:29:03.840
that if I gall him slightly,
it may be death.

2:29:03.960 --> 2:29:08.760
Look you, if this should fail,
'twere better not assayed.

2:29:08.880 --> 2:29:10.880
Therefore, this project
should have a back or second

2:29:11.000 --> 2:29:13.360
that might hold
if this should blast in proof.

2:29:13.480 --> 2:29:16.160
Soft, let me see.

2:29:17.680 --> 2:29:22.480
When in his motion he is hot and dry
and that he calls for drink,

2:29:22.600 --> 2:29:26.000
I'll have prepared him
a chalice of the like.

2:29:26.119 --> 2:29:29.680
Whereon but sipping, if he by chance
escape your venomed point,

2:29:29.800 --> 2:29:31.800
our purpose may hold there.

2:29:31.920 --> 2:29:36.560
― 'Twill do, my lord.
― This grave shall have a living monument.

2:29:38.119 --> 2:29:44.439
An hour of quiet shortly shall we see.
Till then, in patience our proceedings be.

2:30:01.040 --> 2:30:04.720
Does it not, think thee,
stand me now upon?

2:30:04.840 --> 2:30:07.360
He that hath killed my king,
whored my mother,

2:30:07.480 --> 2:30:09.920
stepped between the succession
and my hopes,

2:30:10.040 --> 2:30:14.760
thrown out his warrant for my proper life,
and with such treachery.

2:30:14.880 --> 2:30:19.000
Is it not perfect conscience
to quit him with this arm?

2:30:19.119 --> 2:30:20.720
And is it not to be damned

2:30:20.840 --> 2:30:24.640
to let this canker
of our nature come in further evil?

2:30:24.760 --> 2:30:26.360
It will be shortly known to him
from England

2:30:26.480 --> 2:30:28.040
what is the issue of the business there.

2:30:28.160 --> 2:30:29.160
It will be short.

2:30:29.279 --> 2:30:32.320
The interim's mine, and a man's life
no more than to say, "One!"

2:30:32.439 --> 2:30:35.279
So Rosencrantz and Guildenstern go to it?

2:30:35.400 --> 2:30:39.560
Why man, they did make love
to this employment!

2:30:39.680 --> 2:30:42.520
Their defeat
doth by their own insinuation grow.

2:30:42.640 --> 2:30:46.080
― They are not near my conscience!
― Why, what a king is this?

2:30:48.360 --> 2:30:54.640
But I am very sorry, good Horatio,
that to Laertes I forgot myself.

2:30:55.840 --> 2:30:59.160
For by the image of my cause
I see the portraiture of his.

2:30:59.279 --> 2:31:00.279
I'll beg his pardon.

2:31:00.400 --> 2:31:04.000
But sure, the bravery of his grief
did put me into a towering passion.

2:31:04.119 --> 2:31:05.119
Peace, who comes here?

2:31:05.240 --> 2:31:08.000
Your lordship
is most welcome back to Denmark.

2:31:08.119 --> 2:31:10.200
I humbly thank you, madam.
Dost know this lady?

2:31:10.320 --> 2:31:11.439
No, my good lord.

2:31:11.560 --> 2:31:14.080
Sweet lord,
if your lordship were at leisure,

2:31:14.200 --> 2:31:16.439
I should impart a thing to you
from his majesty.

2:31:18.480 --> 2:31:21.560
I will attend it
with all diligence of spirit.

2:31:21.680 --> 2:31:24.720
My lord, his majesty bade me
signify this to you,

2:31:24.840 --> 2:31:27.920
that he has laid a great wager
on your head.

2:31:28.040 --> 2:31:29.520
This is the matter.

2:31:29.640 --> 2:31:33.520
You are not ignorant of what excellence
Laertes is at his weapon,

2:31:33.640 --> 2:31:36.720
― rapier and dagger.
― That's two of his weapons, but well...

2:31:36.840 --> 2:31:40.320
The king has wagered that in a dozen
passes between you and him,

2:31:40.439 --> 2:31:42.880
he shall not exceed you three hits,

2:31:43.000 --> 2:31:45.240
and that it would come to immediate trial

2:31:45.360 --> 2:31:47.439
if your lordship
will vouchsafe the answer.

2:31:51.320 --> 2:31:53.080
How if I answer no?

2:31:55.800 --> 2:31:58.439
If it please his majesty,
let the foils be brought.

2:31:58.560 --> 2:32:00.040
I'll win for him if I can.

2:32:00.160 --> 2:32:03.000
If not, I'll gain nothing
but my shame and the odd hit.

2:32:03.119 --> 2:32:05.439
I commend my duty to your lordship.

2:32:10.920 --> 2:32:13.960
― You will lose this wager, my lord.
― I do not think so.

2:32:14.080 --> 2:32:16.960
Since he went into France
I've been in continual practice.

2:32:17.080 --> 2:32:21.520
Nay, good my lord,
if your mind dislike any thing, obey.

2:32:21.640 --> 2:32:24.600
I will forestall their coming hither
and say you are not fit.

2:32:24.720 --> 2:32:27.000
Not a whit, we defy augury.

2:32:29.360 --> 2:32:33.560
There is a special providence
in the fall of a sparrow.

2:32:35.720 --> 2:32:38.080
If it be now...

2:32:39.840 --> 2:32:41.400
..'tis not to come.

2:32:44.920 --> 2:32:47.680
If it be not to come, it will be now.

2:32:50.119 --> 2:32:53.160
If it be not now, yet it will come.

2:32:53.279 --> 2:32:55.320
The readiness is all.

2:32:56.960 --> 2:33:00.000
Since no man knows aught
of what he leaves,

2:33:00.119 --> 2:33:03.240
what is't to leave betimes?

2:33:05.080 --> 2:33:06.680
Let be.

2:33:37.520 --> 2:33:39.240
KING: Come Hamlet!

2:33:41.119 --> 2:33:46.200
Come and take this hand from me.

2:33:51.040 --> 2:33:55.760
Give me your pardon, sir,
for I have done you wrong...

2:33:57.360 --> 2:33:59.279
..but pardon it as you are a gentleman.

2:33:59.400 --> 2:34:03.119
Sir, in this audience let my disclaiming
from a purposed evil

2:34:03.240 --> 2:34:06.160
free me so far,
in your most generous thoughts,

2:34:06.279 --> 2:34:11.119
that I have shot mine arrow o'er the house
and hurt my brother.

2:34:11.920 --> 2:34:13.960
I am satisfied in nature,

2:34:14.080 --> 2:34:17.320
whose motive in this case
should stir me most to my revenge,

2:34:17.439 --> 2:34:20.200
but in my terms of honour, I stand aloof

2:34:20.320 --> 2:34:23.480
and seek some reconcilement
to keep my name ungorged.

2:34:23.600 --> 2:34:24.800
But till that time,

2:34:24.920 --> 2:34:28.600
I do receive your offered love
like love, and will not wrong it.

2:34:29.600 --> 2:34:33.160
I do embrace it freely
and will this brother's wager freely play.

2:34:35.040 --> 2:34:37.680
― Bring us the foils, come on.
― Come, one for me.

2:34:37.800 --> 2:34:40.920
― Hamlet, you know the wager.
― Very well, my lord.

2:34:41.040 --> 2:34:43.520
Your grace hath laid the odds
on the weaker side.

2:34:43.640 --> 2:34:45.920
This is too heavy, let me see another.

2:34:46.040 --> 2:34:47.040
This likes me well.

2:34:47.160 --> 2:34:48.480
― These foils have all a length?
― Aye, my lord.

2:34:48.600 --> 2:34:50.880
Set me a cup of wine upon the table.

2:34:51.000 --> 2:34:54.240
If Hamlet give the first or second hit

2:34:54.360 --> 2:34:57.279
the king shall drink
to Hamlet's better health.

2:34:57.400 --> 2:35:00.880
And in the cup a jewel shall he throw,

2:35:01.000 --> 2:35:03.360
richer than that
which four successive kings

2:35:03.480 --> 2:35:05.480
in Denmark's crown hath worn.

2:35:05.600 --> 2:35:10.840
Come now, begin.
And you the judges, bear a wary eye.

2:35:11.880 --> 2:35:13.680
HAMLET: Come, sir.

2:35:20.920 --> 2:35:22.439
― One.
― Judgement?

2:35:22.560 --> 2:35:24.720
A hit, a very palpable hit.

2:35:24.840 --> 2:35:28.040
― Well, again.
― Stay, give me drink.

2:35:29.360 --> 2:35:32.760
Hamlet, this pearl is thine.

2:35:32.880 --> 2:35:35.640

― Laertes?
― We'll play on.

2:35:45.240 --> 2:35:48.520
― Another hit, what say you?
― A touch, a touch, I do confess.

2:35:50.320 --> 2:35:54.520
Here's to thy health. Give him the cup.

2:35:54.640 --> 2:35:56.480
I dare not drink yet. By and by.

2:35:56.600 --> 2:36:00.720
You are hot and scant of breath.
Here's a napkin, rub thy brow.

2:36:00.840 --> 2:36:03.600
― Good madam!
― Come, let me wipe thy face.

2:36:04.640 --> 2:36:08.560
My lord, I'll hit him now,
and yet 'tis almost 'gainst my conscience.

2:36:08.680 --> 2:36:10.119
Come, Laertes, for the third.

2:36:10.240 --> 2:36:13.080
You but dally.
I pray you pass with your best violence.

2:36:13.200 --> 2:36:17.360
― I'm afeard you make a wanton of me.
― Say you so? Come on!

2:36:23.640 --> 2:36:26.480
― OSRIC: Nothing neither way.
― LAERTES: Have at you now!

― Why, as a woodcock to mine own snare,

I am justly killed by mine own treachery.

Hamlet, thou art slain.

In thee there is not half an hour of life.
No medicine in the world can do thee good.

2:38:05.200 --> 2:38:10.000

unbated and envenomed.

Give order that these bodies
high on a stage be placed to the view.

2:41:22.360 --> 2:41:24.360
And let me speak
to the yet unknowing world

2:41:24.480 --> 2:41:25.960
how these things came about.

2:41:27.000 --> 2:41:32.119
So shall you hear of carnal,
bloody and unnatural acts,

2:41:32.240 --> 2:41:34.160
of accidental judgements,

2:41:34.279 --> 2:41:35.680
casual slaughters,

2:41:35.800 --> 2:41:37.960
of deaths put on
by cunning and forced cause

2:41:38.080 --> 2:41:42.240
and in this upshot, purposes mistook
fallen on the inventors' heads.

with sorrow I embrace my fortune.

I have some rights of memory
in this kingdom,

2:42:05.400 --> 2:42:08.960
which now to claim
my vantage doth invite me.

on plots and errors happen.
