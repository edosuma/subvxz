WEBVTT

00:09.096 --> 00:10.619
You have it.

00:10.662 --> 00:12.229
The man who
wishes to run the future

00:12.273 --> 00:15.232
of America's missile program
is the same man who wrote this.

00:15.276 --> 00:16.956
Parsons has been in touch
with the very man

00:16.980 --> 00:18.540
he claims he's never met.

00:18.583 --> 00:20.629
I accept everything about you.

00:20.672 --> 00:23.719
We got past you being in
that-that group of Jack's

00:23.762 --> 00:25.068
when we first met.

00:25.112 --> 00:27.114
Because you don't know
anything about it.

00:27.157 --> 00:29.551
Crossing the abyss

00:29.594 --> 00:31.770
is our most perilous working.

00:31.814 --> 00:36.384
Frater E.D. may believe
he has met his angel,

00:36.427 --> 00:40.431
but if there were
a trace of falsehood,

00:40.475 --> 00:43.043
the outcome would be tragic.

00:43.086 --> 00:46.437
If you cannot fulfill the task
that I have given you, well,

00:46.481 --> 00:50.093
prison is the only way
the debt can be paid.

00:50.137 --> 00:51.399
I'd keep your distance.

00:51.442 --> 00:53.042
Last guy he was with
didn't fare so well.

00:53.066 --> 00:54.358
You're early.

00:54.402 --> 00:55.577
What are you doing?

00:59.537 --> 01:01.148
Come back!

01:01.191 --> 01:04.367
But does this fear mean
you must limit yourself?

01:04.412 --> 01:06.196
No, I suppose it doesn't.

01:06.240 --> 01:09.982
But I don't think Jack can
handle sharing me.

01:10.026 --> 01:12.115
Go wake the believers.

01:12.159 --> 01:14.074
That I will lead a pure life

01:14.117 --> 01:15.684
as a devoted servant
of the Order.

01:15.727 --> 01:18.165
I will lead a pure life as
a devoted servant of the Order.

01:20.000 --> 01:26.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:33.571 --> 01:37.314
There's no escape.

01:37.358 --> 01:41.057
You will pay for what you've
done, one way or the other.

01:41.101 --> 01:43.190
I'm not afraid.

01:43.233 --> 01:46.584
You should be.

01:46.628 --> 01:49.718
'Cause you will rot in a cage,

01:49.761 --> 01:52.155
and no one will shed a tear.

02:46.122 --> 02:48.211
You should probably go.

02:48.255 --> 02:50.779
It's not even dark yet.

02:50.822 --> 02:53.608
He could come home early.

02:53.651 --> 02:56.263
Yes.

02:56.306 --> 03:00.832
On the other hand... you...

03:00.876 --> 03:02.617
could come again.

03:02.660 --> 03:05.185
Careful. You'll choke.

03:08.188 --> 03:10.494
Can you imagine?

03:10.538 --> 03:12.366
First you and then me,

03:12.409 --> 03:15.804
choking to death
on this bloody ring.

03:21.157 --> 03:24.029
You know, the reason I devoted
myself to this faith

03:24.073 --> 03:29.034
was so that I wouldn't have
to hide from anyone.

03:29.078 --> 03:31.994
Things are contentious enough
in this house as it is.

03:32.037 --> 03:34.214
He channeled the angel.

03:34.257 --> 03:37.739
He should be above
such petty jealousy.

03:37.782 --> 03:39.697
We need to keep this between us.

03:39.741 --> 03:41.003
Yes.

03:41.046 --> 03:43.484
Or we need to stop.

03:43.527 --> 03:46.269
You have made that very clear.

03:49.185 --> 03:51.405
Looking for these?

03:56.714 --> 03:58.150
Up.

03:58.194 --> 04:00.501
I need to strip the bed.

04:00.544 --> 04:03.112
It's been a while since
I got to do something

04:03.155 --> 04:06.724
that feels forbidden.

04:06.768 --> 04:08.770
Alfred...

04:31.967 --> 04:34.970
I'll always remember
you like this.

04:35.013 --> 04:38.234
Doing laundry?

04:38.278 --> 04:41.368
Everything out in the
open, everything clean.

04:41.411 --> 04:43.370
Thanks to you.

04:45.415 --> 04:47.548
You never told me
what you did to him.

04:47.591 --> 04:49.854
You really want to know?

04:52.204 --> 04:53.293
No.

04:55.338 --> 04:57.862
Only...

04:57.906 --> 04:59.516
Did he suffer?

04:59.560 --> 05:02.606
He'll never hurt anyone
with those hands ever again.

05:09.961 --> 05:12.355
Are you sorry?

05:12.399 --> 05:14.052
Are you?

05:14.096 --> 05:16.272
No.

05:18.448 --> 05:22.322
The law will be coming
for me soon.

05:22.365 --> 05:25.934
Your step-father was the
only one keeping them at bay.

05:27.805 --> 05:30.808
I can't imagine
he'll let sleeping dogs lie.

05:30.852 --> 05:32.549
I'll have to be on my way.

05:32.593 --> 05:34.203
Where will you go?

05:34.246 --> 05:37.206
It's best I not say.

05:37.249 --> 05:39.600
That way you won't have
to lie when they ask you.

05:52.656 --> 05:56.791
I ran your JPL proposal
up the flagpole.

05:56.834 --> 05:59.271
It's not gonna fly.

05:59.315 --> 06:01.143
What? Why?

06:01.186 --> 06:04.581
I will give you
three guesses, Mr. Parsons.

06:04.625 --> 06:06.453
You know what, make that one.

06:06.496 --> 06:07.715
Under ordinary circumstances,

06:07.758 --> 06:09.118
I wouldn't give a damn
what you did

06:09.151 --> 06:10.431
in the privacy of your own home.

06:10.455 --> 06:12.546
Is this because of you?

06:12.589 --> 06:15.418
It is, isn't it?

06:15.462 --> 06:17.420
He's had a bone to pick with me
since day one.

06:17.464 --> 06:20.336
I make it a point
to know certain facts.

06:20.380 --> 06:23.426
For instance, you claim you've
never met Aleister Crowley,

06:23.470 --> 06:25.820
but I know that's
a load of bull. How do you know?

06:25.863 --> 06:27.822
I'm not obligated
to reveal my sources.

06:27.865 --> 06:29.258
You follow a man

06:29.301 --> 06:31.391
who is a suspected traitor
to his own country,

06:31.434 --> 06:33.262
with known ties to our enemy.
What ties?

06:33.305 --> 06:35.525
General J.F.C. Fuller, for one,

06:35.569 --> 06:37.353
a disciple of Crowley's
who was sidelined

06:37.397 --> 06:40.443
by the British military
because of his Nazi ties.

06:40.487 --> 06:42.167
There are even allegations
that Crowley has

06:42.191 --> 06:44.578
made attempts to
meet Hitler himself.

06:44.621 --> 06:46.449
Why would Crowley want
to contact Hitler?

06:46.493 --> 06:49.060
Maybe it's because of their
shared interest in the occult.

06:49.104 --> 06:51.280
Maybe because both see
themselves as ushering in

06:51.323 --> 06:53.413
a new era for mankind.

06:53.456 --> 06:55.676
Given all this, serious
questions are being raised

06:55.719 --> 06:57.025
about your allegiances.

06:57.068 --> 06:59.723
Unfortunately, JPL
is off the table.

06:59.767 --> 07:01.638
Or at least with you
as a part of it.

07:06.121 --> 07:08.950
All right, well...

07:08.993 --> 07:13.781
I'd like to invite you both
to a gathering at my home...

07:13.824 --> 07:17.785
so that you can see there's
absolutely nothing to fear.

07:22.964 --> 07:24.705
This feels sacrilegious.

07:24.748 --> 07:26.184
It's just for one night.

07:26.228 --> 07:28.622
I'm sure the Master
would understand.

07:32.582 --> 07:34.410
We owe it to Frater J.P.

07:34.454 --> 07:36.717
He's done so much for us. You watch.

07:36.760 --> 07:38.920
These men tonight gonna be
treating us like we the help

07:38.944 --> 07:40.990
inside our own damn home.

07:42.200 --> 07:46.727
From the outside in,
in order of use.

07:46.770 --> 07:50.513
The Byrnes never had
formal dinners growing up?

07:50.557 --> 07:53.385
Thank you...

07:53.429 --> 07:55.170
for helping.

07:55.213 --> 07:56.563
I really appreciate it.

07:56.606 --> 07:58.173
You're welcome.

07:58.216 --> 08:00.436
I'm not sure
who you're used to hosting,

08:00.480 --> 08:02.480
but this place looked fit
for a caravan of gypsies,

08:02.504 --> 08:04.048
and not much else.

08:04.092 --> 08:06.268
You didn't need to invite her.

08:06.311 --> 08:09.097
I could've done it alone.

08:09.140 --> 08:12.361
She hosted millions of
these when I was a kid.

08:12.404 --> 08:16.757
Plus, having her here makes
us seem more... normal.

08:19.934 --> 08:22.806
I didn't know if
I should answer.

08:22.850 --> 08:24.504
No, no. It's better if I do it.

08:24.547 --> 08:26.331
Could you do me a favor? Anything.

08:26.375 --> 08:28.420
Could you go check on the Magus?

08:28.464 --> 08:30.784
I want to know if he's planning
on joining the festivities,

08:30.808 --> 08:33.202
or if he's just going to sulk
in his room all night.

08:38.605 --> 08:40.607
Are you Frater J.P.?

08:40.650 --> 08:42.390
Yeah. Got a special delivery here

08:42.433 --> 08:44.567
from a M. Therion.

08:44.611 --> 08:46.656
Thank you.

09:28.263 --> 09:30.047
May I come in? Please.

09:30.091 --> 09:32.331
Frater J.P. was wondering if
you were going to come down.

09:32.355 --> 09:35.139
Was he, now?
How considerate of him. This night is about

09:35.183 --> 09:37.620
showing these men they
don't have to fear us.

09:37.664 --> 09:39.883
What's it look like
if we're hiding our Magus away?

09:39.927 --> 09:42.103
Well, you can tell Frater J.P.

09:42.146 --> 09:45.323
that I've decided to attend
his little function.

09:47.108 --> 09:50.502
The only decision that's left
is what to wear.

09:50.546 --> 09:52.766
Do I go as the man I am,

09:52.809 --> 09:56.117
or the man they'd
prefer me to be?

09:56.160 --> 09:58.162
I think the choice is obvious.

10:00.338 --> 10:04.342
I had to pretend to be something
I wasn't in order to survive.

10:06.344 --> 10:08.695
The circumstances
were a bit different.

10:08.738 --> 10:11.262
These men tonight
are soldiers, too.

10:11.306 --> 10:13.395
And soldiers are
trained for one thing:

10:13.438 --> 10:15.658
To kill their enemies.

10:30.325 --> 10:31.718
I help you with something?

10:31.761 --> 10:33.676
Just looking for somewhere
to hide this.

10:33.720 --> 10:35.460
What is it?

10:35.504 --> 10:37.332
"Dear Frater J.P.,
it has always been

10:37.375 --> 10:39.116
"my top priority to
increase the size

10:39.160 --> 10:40.596
"and influence of
our congregation.

10:40.640 --> 10:42.440
"You are central to this
work, especially with

10:42.483 --> 10:43.963
"the might of the
military behind you."

10:43.987 --> 10:46.602
"Based on the testimony
I've received..."

10:46.646 --> 10:48.996
"you are emerging as a true
Magnus of the Lodge."

10:51.476 --> 10:52.739
"To aid in your endeavors,

10:52.782 --> 10:54.349
I've prepared a new manifesto."

10:54.392 --> 10:56.743
The Master wrote you a new work.

10:56.786 --> 10:58.186
Now, why would you try
to hide this?

10:58.222 --> 10:59.702
Jack? They're here.

10:59.746 --> 11:01.573
Crowley's the reason
I'm in hot water.

11:01.617 --> 11:03.793
If they see that, the jig is up.

11:04.838 --> 11:06.883
It must be exhausting,

11:06.927 --> 11:09.407
serving two masters.
It's not about serving them.

11:09.451 --> 11:11.496
If we can win them over,
I get JPL.

11:11.540 --> 11:13.063
What in the hell is that?

11:13.107 --> 11:15.718
It's how I get to the stars.

11:15.762 --> 11:18.547
Thy will be done.

11:33.301 --> 11:36.086
General Braxton, Agent Wallace.

11:36.130 --> 11:40.003
Everyone, welcome
to the Parsonage.

12:53.598 --> 12:56.166
This is such a bad idea.

12:56.210 --> 12:58.168
Jack didn't have a choice.

12:58.212 --> 13:00.127
They were gonna cut him
out of the project.

13:00.170 --> 13:03.565
These bosses of yours have no
clue what they're walking into.

13:03.608 --> 13:06.742
I told you, you
didn't have to come.

13:06.786 --> 13:09.005
And I told you I wanted to.

13:09.049 --> 13:12.313
And yet, we've been sitting
out here for half an hour.

13:12.356 --> 13:13.749
Let's go.

13:13.793 --> 13:15.577
I just need another minute.

13:15.620 --> 13:17.187
Sweetie,
if you're worried about me

13:17.231 --> 13:19.537
seeing what's in there,
don't be.

13:19.581 --> 13:22.018
Jack's been teaching me
some of the techniques.

13:22.062 --> 13:25.848
Techniques? Yeah, like
manifesting your will.

13:25.892 --> 13:29.199
Right now, I am manifesting
a successful party.

13:44.780 --> 13:48.218
Good evening, Mr. Onsted.
May I take your hat?

13:56.313 --> 13:58.533
Sister M!

13:58.576 --> 14:00.535
My love.

14:00.578 --> 14:02.450
Aw, I was hoping you'd come.

14:02.493 --> 14:05.061
I'm just a plus-one tonight.

14:05.105 --> 14:06.802
You know Richard?

14:06.846 --> 14:09.587
Of course.
The man you left us for.

14:09.631 --> 14:11.589
It's nice to see you again.

14:11.633 --> 14:14.288
Little less of me
than last time.

14:15.942 --> 14:18.379
He just stopped by
to see Jack on a day

14:18.422 --> 14:19.859
I didn't feel
like wearing a top.

14:21.121 --> 14:22.862
Some things
never change, I guess.

14:22.905 --> 14:24.211
Let's go out on the terrace.

14:24.254 --> 14:25.212
I think I see Chiang

14:25.255 --> 14:26.604
and Mrs. Gui.

14:31.131 --> 14:33.350
To us. Salud.

14:35.352 --> 14:37.441
Agent Wallace. Mr. Onsted.

14:37.485 --> 14:39.052
I trust
you're enjoying yourself.

14:39.095 --> 14:42.011
Illuminating, yes. And
you must be Marisol.

14:42.055 --> 14:43.970
I've heard so much about you,

14:44.013 --> 14:46.842
I feel like we're old friends.

14:46.886 --> 14:49.018
I hate to see your
hands so empty.

14:49.062 --> 14:50.846
I'm afraid I'm a teetotaler.

14:50.890 --> 14:52.239
I see.

14:52.282 --> 14:53.849
Well, don't let the Aerojet boys

14:53.893 --> 14:55.851
monopolize too much
of your time tonight.

14:55.895 --> 14:58.898
I will take a club soda,
if you have it.

15:01.944 --> 15:04.555
Well, I'll see you inside.

15:05.600 --> 15:06.731
Jack.

15:06.775 --> 15:08.472
Well, it's about damn time.

15:08.516 --> 15:10.692
I was beginning to think
you guys were a no-show.

15:10.735 --> 15:13.564
Well, we're here. Ready to
support in any way I can.

15:13.608 --> 15:15.871
Thanks. I brought
some reinforcements.

15:19.353 --> 15:20.673
I hope you know
what you're doing.

15:29.319 --> 15:31.060
Check out the dust pattern.

15:31.104 --> 15:33.584
Something else was hanging here.

15:33.628 --> 15:35.586
Same thing
in three other places.

15:35.630 --> 15:38.981
Clearly, not everything here
is what it seems.

15:39.025 --> 15:41.201
Indeed.

15:45.466 --> 15:46.989
Keep looking.

15:47.033 --> 15:48.860
We don't leave here
until we find something

15:48.904 --> 15:52.299
that'll nail Parsons
to the fucking wall.

15:52.342 --> 15:56.303
They say every painting
tells a story.

15:56.346 --> 15:58.392
What does this one
say to you guys?

16:00.394 --> 16:03.963
No? Let's take a closer look.

16:14.451 --> 16:20.109
"Truth," cried
the Lord of the Abyss.

16:20.153 --> 16:22.068
Ladies and gentlemen,
thank you all for coming.

16:22.111 --> 16:25.027
Whether you're a soldier
or a sage,

16:25.071 --> 16:29.814
a sorcerer or a scientist,
inside, we are all the same.

16:29.858 --> 16:34.167
For Thelema tells us that every
man and every woman is a star.

16:34.210 --> 16:36.169
And while tonight may seem like

16:36.212 --> 16:37.997
the coming together
of opposites,

16:38.040 --> 16:39.999
what unites us is ultimately

16:40.042 --> 16:41.609
much stronger
than what divides us.

16:41.652 --> 16:44.742
We are all fighting
for the same thing.

16:44.786 --> 16:47.397
Freedom from tyranny.

16:47.441 --> 16:48.561
Hear, hear. ALL: Hear, hear.

16:50.270 --> 16:53.142
Well said, Frater
J.P., well said.

16:53.186 --> 16:55.797
General,
apologies for the delay.

16:55.840 --> 16:59.366
I was in deep meditation,
trying to manifest victory.

16:59.409 --> 17:01.107
Alfred Miller, Grand Magus.

17:01.150 --> 17:03.030
So you're the one in charge
of all these people?

17:03.065 --> 17:04.545
No one's in charge, General.

17:04.588 --> 17:06.502
Things are a little more
egalitarian than that.

17:06.547 --> 17:08.330
Yes, though we do have
a degree system,

17:08.375 --> 17:09.767
not unlike your military ranks,

17:09.810 --> 17:11.813
but with
a spiritual designation.

17:11.856 --> 17:14.207
I am the most highly ascended.

17:15.772 --> 17:17.339
I guess that makes you my equal,

17:17.384 --> 17:18.559
on the other side.

17:18.602 --> 17:20.387
You are a war hero, General.

17:20.430 --> 17:23.390
I am but a-a humble servant
to the Great Work.

17:23.433 --> 17:25.608
I'm glad you decided
to join us, Magus.

17:25.653 --> 17:27.436
Well, I-I was enticed

17:27.481 --> 17:29.744
from my hovel.

17:34.966 --> 17:40.537
Dinner... is served.

17:49.981 --> 17:52.810
Did one of you put that back up?

17:52.854 --> 17:55.161
No. It reappeared on its own.

17:55.204 --> 17:56.597
As if by magic.

17:56.640 --> 17:59.295
So, this is your Master Therion.

17:59.339 --> 18:02.124
Is it a faithful rendition?

18:02.168 --> 18:04.735
That's right.

18:04.779 --> 18:06.781
You haven't met the man.

18:12.178 --> 18:15.398
I'm gonna find out who did this.

18:28.846 --> 18:30.544
Inside this house,

18:30.587 --> 18:32.285
we try to live free of labels.

18:36.202 --> 18:39.161
You don't drink, you don't eat.

18:39.205 --> 18:40.902
Is there anything you do enjoy?

18:40.945 --> 18:44.123
Is this all you people do
around here?

18:44.166 --> 18:46.299
It's rather tame.

18:46.342 --> 18:48.692
Right.Yeah.

18:50.912 --> 18:52.653
You're just ignore us
the whole night?

18:52.696 --> 18:54.176
We miss you. Come on.

18:54.220 --> 18:57.179
It might get them to shut up.

18:57.223 --> 18:58.876
Yeah, go on.

18:58.920 --> 19:00.922
Go catch up.

19:09.496 --> 19:11.889
Excellent job.
Excuse me one second.

19:13.239 --> 19:14.370
Mrs. Parsons.

19:14.414 --> 19:16.155
Now, don't you dare.

19:16.198 --> 19:19.767
It's Ruth from now on or
I'll call your commanding...

19:19.810 --> 19:22.204
You don't have a
commanding officer, do you?

19:22.248 --> 19:24.206
Two, actually.

19:24.250 --> 19:28.254
President Roosevelt
and my wife Rose.

19:28.297 --> 19:29.951
She's a lucky woman.

19:29.994 --> 19:31.909
That's very kind of you.

19:31.953 --> 19:34.260
I don't know if she always
feels the same way, though.

19:35.739 --> 19:37.088
Are you enjoying yourself?

19:38.133 --> 19:40.091
Am I... am I what?

19:40.135 --> 19:41.571
Enjoying yourself?

19:41.615 --> 19:43.356
Why wouldn't I be?

19:56.020 --> 19:58.762
Is this the special Sherry
that you had delivered?

19:58.806 --> 20:01.591
That color? Heavens, no.

20:02.984 --> 20:04.551
It's not...?

20:04.594 --> 20:05.987
What's wrong?

20:06.030 --> 20:08.163
Now we're talking!

20:08.207 --> 20:10.470
Excuse me, ladies and gentlemen,

20:10.513 --> 20:14.082
I'd like to introduce you all
to the world-famous Parson's.

20:14.125 --> 20:15.257
Poison Punch.

20:15.301 --> 20:16.867
If you can get it down,

20:16.911 --> 20:18.129
life goes down easy.

20:22.308 --> 20:24.179
Now we're talking.

20:24.223 --> 20:26.181
Who told you to
serve that punch?

20:26.225 --> 20:28.009
I thought you wanted us to.

20:28.052 --> 20:29.793
That's what Frater E.D. told us.

20:29.837 --> 20:32.405
It's what you always serve
at your parties.

20:32.448 --> 20:33.580
Not this party.

20:33.623 --> 20:36.452
I'm gonna kill him.

20:39.194 --> 20:40.804
That'll put hair on your chest.

20:42.284 --> 20:45.244
Excuse me, General,
I need to go freshen up.

20:52.990 --> 20:54.775
Cheers. Cheers. It's good.

20:54.818 --> 20:57.212
Are you out of your mind?

20:57.256 --> 20:59.083
On the contrary.

20:59.127 --> 21:01.627
Anyone paying even the slightest
bit of attention can see that...

21:01.651 --> 21:03.194
What? The-the naughty
little gift you left for me?

21:03.218 --> 21:04.458
I-I thought that was the point.

21:04.482 --> 21:05.744
While we suffer this charade,

21:05.787 --> 21:07.657
we can continue
our far more enjoyable one.

21:07.701 --> 21:09.093
I didn't leave those.

21:09.137 --> 21:11.052
Well, someone did, on my pillow.

21:17.145 --> 21:19.626
Well, at least now
we can pursue our will

21:19.669 --> 21:21.454
without further hesitation.

21:21.497 --> 21:24.631
No. No, we have to stop.

21:24.674 --> 21:27.024
Jack made it clear he won't
go down without a fight.

21:27.068 --> 21:29.897
Then... let him fight.

21:29.940 --> 21:31.725
I can fight, too, you know.

21:31.768 --> 21:33.944
I've done so much
to protect what we have here.

21:33.988 --> 21:36.469
I can't be the reason
it falls apart.

21:36.512 --> 21:38.209
I have to find him.Susan...

21:49.351 --> 21:50.657
Have either of you seen Ernest?

21:50.700 --> 21:52.659
No.

21:52.702 --> 21:55.009
Can you do me a favor and
get rid of this punch?

21:55.052 --> 21:56.924
I think the genie
might be out of the bottle.

22:01.711 --> 22:03.670
Maybe it's a good thing.

22:03.713 --> 22:06.629
Jack, can we talk?

22:08.892 --> 22:10.503
What about?

22:10.546 --> 22:13.810
Do what thou wilt
shall be the whole of the law.

22:13.854 --> 22:15.203
Love is the law!

22:15.246 --> 22:17.597
- Love under will!
- Ladies and gentlemen,

22:17.640 --> 22:20.164
there will soon be the smell

22:20.208 --> 22:23.994
of brimstone in the air and
the smell of victory, too.

22:24.038 --> 22:27.084
From the beaches of Normandy,
to the shores of Californ-i-a,

22:27.128 --> 22:28.651
let freedom reign.

22:30.349 --> 22:33.352
Tonight, outside...

22:33.395 --> 22:36.224
outside,
under the solstice moon,

22:36.267 --> 22:38.835
I will share with you
a manifesto.

22:38.879 --> 22:41.969
The latest manifestation
of a new dawn.

22:42.012 --> 22:44.493
"Liber OZ," written for us

22:44.537 --> 22:47.931
by our Master Therion.

22:47.975 --> 22:49.655
I don't think they want
to hear it, Ernest.

22:49.679 --> 22:51.631
Are you kidding, Parsons?

22:51.674 --> 22:53.894
It's a new work by
Aleister Crowley himself?

22:58.704 --> 23:00.224
"Man has the right
to eat what he will.

23:00.248 --> 23:03.207
"Drink what he will.
Think what he will.

23:03.251 --> 23:06.080
"Dwell where he will.
To move across the face

23:06.123 --> 23:08.952
"of the earth, as he will.

23:08.996 --> 23:10.693
"Man has the right
to speak what he will.

23:10.737 --> 23:11.694
"To dress as he will.

23:11.738 --> 23:13.217
"To write what he will.

23:13.261 --> 23:14.621
"To draw, paint,
carve, etch, mold,

23:14.654 --> 23:15.698
and build what he will."

23:18.353 --> 23:19.746
"Man has the right to

23:19.789 --> 23:21.530
love as he will."Thank you.

23:21.574 --> 23:22.966
Thank you, Ernest.

23:23.010 --> 23:25.491
"And last, but not least...

23:25.534 --> 23:27.536
"Man has the right
to kill all those

23:27.580 --> 23:29.233
who would thwart these rights."

23:32.236 --> 23:35.675
And this work arrived
at the Parsonage just today.

23:35.718 --> 23:39.505
It was intended for the one
true Magus of this lodge.

23:39.548 --> 23:41.724
Will that man

23:41.768 --> 23:44.423
kindly step forward
and claim his mantle?

23:50.516 --> 23:54.128
Thank you, Frater E.D.

23:54.171 --> 23:56.913
You are quite right.
I've been derelict

23:56.957 --> 23:58.567
in my duties to you,

23:58.611 --> 24:02.832
and to all my
faithful followers.

24:02.876 --> 24:05.269
But this will end...

24:05.313 --> 24:07.446
Only those who fear shall fail.

24:07.489 --> 24:10.318
For the uninitiated,

24:10.361 --> 24:13.103
our faith demands

24:13.147 --> 24:15.541
that we live

24:15.584 --> 24:19.762
according to our true will,
which we must never

24:19.806 --> 24:23.897
hide nor suppress,
not for anyone's sake.

24:25.333 --> 24:28.031
With that in mind,

24:28.075 --> 24:31.600
tonight we will celebrate
the solstice the way

24:31.644 --> 24:34.603
it was meant to be celebrated.

24:38.041 --> 24:43.394
Jack, I do hope you don't
mind my making one.

24:43.438 --> 24:46.093
What are you doing here?

24:46.136 --> 24:48.443
My instructions were very clear.

24:48.487 --> 24:51.533
Instead of placating these men,

24:51.577 --> 24:53.927
you were told to bring them
into the fold.

24:53.970 --> 24:57.757
Can you imagine the might

24:57.800 --> 25:01.282
of the military
and the power of Thelema

25:01.325 --> 25:02.718
fused as one?

25:03.763 --> 25:05.547
We, here,

25:05.591 --> 25:07.854
vanquish our enemies,

25:07.897 --> 25:09.551
not through violence,

25:09.595 --> 25:14.077
but...

25:14.121 --> 25:16.384
through love.

25:18.734 --> 25:24.348
I... priest and king,

25:24.392 --> 25:28.222
take thee, Virgin,

25:28.265 --> 25:32.879
pure without spot.

25:32.922 --> 25:38.449
And I... who am all pleasure...

25:38.493 --> 25:40.756
desire you.

25:42.149 --> 25:44.238
Love is the law!

25:44.281 --> 25:47.676
Love is the law!
Love is the law!

25:47.720 --> 25:50.810
There is no law beyond...

25:50.853 --> 25:54.335
"do... what...

25:54.378 --> 25:57.294
thou... wilt."

25:57.338 --> 26:00.646
This was meant to be your role
in the Great Work,

26:00.689 --> 26:02.212
but you have failed me, Jack.

26:02.256 --> 26:04.388
They are questioning
my allegiances because

26:04.432 --> 26:06.303
yours are about as clear
as swamp water.

26:06.347 --> 26:10.220
They? Who are they?

26:10.264 --> 26:14.355
General Braxton?
Young Agent Wallace?

26:14.398 --> 26:17.576
You've been so worried about
losing their support.

26:17.619 --> 26:21.405
You should be a little more
concerned about losing mine.

26:21.449 --> 26:24.147
Fortunately, some of
your compatriots

26:24.191 --> 26:26.410
have proven a little
more loyal than you.

26:26.454 --> 26:29.762
You put them up to this?
They didn't require coercion.

26:29.805 --> 26:32.416
Alfred is a true believer.

26:32.460 --> 26:35.637
And as for Frater E.D...

26:35.681 --> 26:39.032
Well, his actions aren't
in spite of you,

26:39.075 --> 26:40.903
they're because of you.

26:40.947 --> 26:45.342
His desire to Cross the Abyss

26:45.386 --> 26:48.650
is motivating all.

26:48.694 --> 26:50.173
That's what this is about?

26:50.217 --> 26:54.656
Yes, and the night
is young, still.

26:54.700 --> 26:56.615
What else is he gonna do?

26:56.658 --> 26:59.008
The crossing...

26:59.052 --> 27:03.012
The crossing requires
a union of opposites...

27:03.056 --> 27:05.536
and a great sacrifice.

27:07.582 --> 27:10.063
Wait, what kind of sacrifice?

27:10.106 --> 27:11.455
I am the blue-lidded

27:11.499 --> 27:12.935
daughter of sunset!

27:12.979 --> 27:15.372
I am the naked brilliance!

27:15.416 --> 27:18.593
Drink to me!

27:27.646 --> 27:29.299
I'm sorry for everything
that's happening.

27:29.343 --> 27:30.692
It's not your fault.

27:30.736 --> 27:32.912
I know you don't actually
feel that way. Please.

27:32.955 --> 27:35.958
Look, I shouldn't have
kept it secret.

27:36.002 --> 27:37.917
But you shouldn't have
laid down restrictions.

27:37.960 --> 27:40.963
All my dreams are hanging
by a fucking thread right now.

27:41.007 --> 27:42.878
What about me? Am I
a part of those dreams?

27:42.922 --> 27:45.185
Of course. But this is
how we've chosen to live.

27:46.665 --> 27:51.670
You and Alfred's workings
are the least of my problems.

27:51.713 --> 27:54.368
They weren't just workings,
Jack.

28:12.429 --> 28:15.650
How have you put up with it?

28:15.694 --> 28:19.088
Being with someone who was a
part of something like this?

28:20.742 --> 28:22.831
I mean, the thought
of someone you love,

28:22.875 --> 28:27.096
doing unspeakable acts
with all these people...

28:27.140 --> 28:29.577
would be tough to shake.

28:32.406 --> 28:35.148
How have you put up with it?

28:35.191 --> 28:37.890
How have you put up with it?

28:39.543 --> 28:41.284
Are you taking notes, Richie?

28:51.947 --> 28:54.080
I have to go.

28:55.298 --> 28:56.952
Richie...

29:02.888 --> 29:05.328
Hold on! RICHARD: I can't believe I
actually thought there was

29:05.352 --> 29:07.963
something to this
whole thing. It's sick.

29:08.007 --> 29:09.269
Perverse.

29:09.312 --> 29:11.072
Brilliant idea,
bringing everyone here, Jack.

29:11.096 --> 29:12.446
It's fucking brilliant.

29:12.489 --> 29:14.883
Thanks to you, we can
all kiss JPL good-bye.

29:18.887 --> 29:21.281
Love is the law! Love as you live!

29:21.324 --> 29:22.586
Love is the law!

29:22.630 --> 29:25.415
Love is the law! Love as you live!

29:25.459 --> 29:26.721
You getting in?

29:26.765 --> 29:28.462
Don't want you having
to ride home

29:28.505 --> 29:30.812
with such a sick pervert.
My God.

29:30.856 --> 29:32.248
Come on, Marisol.

29:32.292 --> 29:34.598
I wasn't talking
about you, obviously.

29:34.642 --> 29:36.252
Why is that obvious?
I was one of them.

29:36.296 --> 29:37.558
Yes. Was.

29:37.601 --> 29:39.865
That's right. I quit for you.

29:39.908 --> 29:41.780
Because I knew you would
judge me for it.

29:41.823 --> 29:43.453
Why are you acting like
I've done something wrong?

29:43.477 --> 29:44.837
I came in here
with an open mind...

29:44.870 --> 29:46.828
You talked about
"manifesting your will."

29:46.872 --> 29:49.004
Well, how do you think
that gets done, Richie?

29:49.048 --> 29:51.093
It's called sex magick, not...

29:51.137 --> 29:53.313
"be nice and work
real hard" magick.

29:53.356 --> 29:55.445
You want to go back in there
so you can see how

29:55.489 --> 29:57.012
it all finishes?

29:57.056 --> 29:58.656
We're kind of
in the middle of something.

29:58.680 --> 29:59.754
The gates are locked shut.

29:59.798 --> 30:00.799
What do you mean?

30:00.842 --> 30:02.801
I mean, no one can get out.

30:24.605 --> 30:26.781
Don't tell me you're
thinking of leaving?

30:26.825 --> 30:28.261
What was in that drink?

30:28.304 --> 30:30.437
Why don't you take
a seat, Captain? It's General.

30:30.480 --> 30:32.874
Well, you can be president
for all I care.

30:32.918 --> 30:34.963
We're all flesh on the inside.

30:35.007 --> 30:37.661
We all crave the same things.

30:37.705 --> 30:40.186
Out there
is just war and misery.

30:40.229 --> 30:43.102
In here is the garden
of earthly delights.

30:43.145 --> 30:46.845
Live each day
as if it's your last.

30:49.760 --> 30:52.938
I'll leave you two
to your own devices.

30:57.464 --> 30:59.901
I wish I knew what to say
about all this.

30:59.945 --> 31:03.209
I don't think I'm
in any state to drive.

31:03.252 --> 31:05.559
Perhaps we can find
somewhere quiet

31:05.602 --> 31:08.257
while you gather
your wits about you.Please.

31:23.794 --> 31:26.841
I always wanted to be a dancer.

31:28.147 --> 31:30.366
Parsons!

31:30.410 --> 31:32.847
I had you pegged
all wrong, my friend.

31:32.891 --> 31:35.023
You throw one heck of a party.

31:37.156 --> 31:38.505
Princeton.

31:38.548 --> 31:41.116
Old Nassau,
as we used to call it.

31:41.160 --> 31:43.902
Best four years of my life.

31:43.945 --> 31:45.904
And how about you?

31:45.947 --> 31:48.297
Madchenschule Berlin.

31:48.341 --> 31:50.734
Forgive me...

31:50.778 --> 31:54.129
but y-you weren't born
a woman, were you?

31:54.173 --> 31:56.610
I only ask because Madchenschule

31:56.653 --> 32:00.135
is an all-girls school, no?

32:00.179 --> 32:03.095
You caught me in a fib.

32:03.138 --> 32:06.098
But you are mistaken
in one aspect.

32:06.141 --> 32:08.578
I wasborn a girl.

32:08.622 --> 32:11.320
Just in the wrong body.

32:12.800 --> 32:15.803
Well, I don't see
anything wrong with it.

32:39.479 --> 32:41.568
Ernest?

32:41.611 --> 32:43.613
Are you in there?

32:53.841 --> 32:55.843
This is quite a house.

32:57.018 --> 32:58.977
Gemutlichkeit.

33:02.241 --> 33:04.678
My aunt, niece and nephew:

33:04.721 --> 33:07.550
Getrude, Ursula and Heinrich.

33:17.604 --> 33:20.607
Did you ever play
hide-and-seek as a child?

33:20.650 --> 33:23.653
Sure. Das Verteckspiel.

33:25.133 --> 33:28.223
In America, when it's time
to come out, we yell,

33:28.267 --> 33:30.660
"Olly olly oxen free!"

33:30.704 --> 33:35.665
Alle, alle auch sind frei.

33:35.709 --> 33:39.278
Everyone, everyone is free.

33:39.321 --> 33:41.976
It's a nice idea, in theory.

33:44.805 --> 33:47.329
So, I'm curious.

33:47.373 --> 33:49.592
How does this work?

34:00.212 --> 34:03.171
Are you the man or the woman?

34:03.215 --> 34:07.741
Always a woman.

34:07.784 --> 34:10.570
I see.

34:10.612 --> 34:12.092
But we can do other things.

34:12.137 --> 34:15.835
Like what?

34:15.879 --> 34:17.489
Suck my cock?

34:20.971 --> 34:23.409
What if I want to suck yours?

34:25.889 --> 34:28.283
What are you doing?

34:28.327 --> 34:30.981
Your "Master," Aleister Crowley,

34:31.025 --> 34:35.029
made several trips to Germany
between 1930 and 1932.

34:35.072 --> 34:37.118
Am I safe in assuming
that this is when

34:37.161 --> 34:38.859
you were introduced to Thelema?

34:38.902 --> 34:42.167
Did Crowley help you gain
passage to America?

34:42.210 --> 34:43.907
Why are you asking me all this?

34:43.951 --> 34:46.996
Know thyself. Know thine enemy.

34:58.313 --> 35:00.446
I'm gonna need that back.

35:00.489 --> 35:02.752
Frater, you are truly lost.

35:02.796 --> 35:04.580
Why don't you shut the fuck up

35:04.624 --> 35:06.843
and stop pretending
like you know everything?

35:06.887 --> 35:09.716
You have been misled
by a delusion.

35:09.759 --> 35:11.979
See, you speak of truth,
brother,

35:12.022 --> 35:14.199
but I see you,

35:14.242 --> 35:15.852
walking around
all over this house

35:15.896 --> 35:17.680
like a dog with two dicks.

35:17.724 --> 35:19.900
You're as chock-full of bullshit
as anyone else.

35:19.943 --> 35:22.424
I'm not scared of you.

35:22.468 --> 35:25.471
No. You're scared
of what's in here.

35:33.305 --> 35:34.480
It was you.

35:34.523 --> 35:38.614
You doubt my vision,

35:38.658 --> 35:41.530
but it's your vision
that's truly clouded.

35:41.574 --> 35:44.098
By what?

35:44.142 --> 35:45.969
Kanebgik...

35:46.013 --> 35:49.451
You're in love.

35:52.411 --> 35:54.326
Ernest.

36:01.550 --> 36:03.639
There you are.

36:03.683 --> 36:05.511
Thank you, Mother,
for looking after.

36:05.554 --> 36:07.991
General Braxton.

36:08.035 --> 36:10.472
The General was just telling me

36:10.516 --> 36:13.214
about storming the
beaches at Normandy.

36:13.258 --> 36:14.563
I'm sorry, son.

36:14.607 --> 36:17.175
I don't know what came over me.

36:20.569 --> 36:22.832
No one needs to know
what happened here tonight.

36:24.921 --> 36:27.228
In fact, um...

36:27.272 --> 36:31.450
I don't see any reason why,
JPL shouldn't be allowed

36:31.493 --> 36:32.625
to move forward.

36:34.235 --> 36:36.019
Full steam ahead,

36:36.063 --> 36:39.545
with you at the helm.

36:39.588 --> 36:42.504
What the hell
is taking Chiang so long?

36:42.548 --> 36:45.159
We could go look, too.
You do what you want.

36:45.203 --> 36:47.553
I'm staying right where I am.

36:47.596 --> 36:50.599
As soon as those gates
are open, I'm out of here.

36:50.643 --> 36:52.645
Okay.

36:56.518 --> 37:00.261
For the record,
I don't think you're a pervert.

37:03.308 --> 37:05.353
I've never seen anything
like that before,

37:05.397 --> 37:09.270
never even imagined
anything like that before.

37:09.314 --> 37:12.534
That's okay, Richie.
I know it's not for everyone.

37:16.016 --> 37:18.888
You miss it?

37:18.932 --> 37:20.934
No.

37:22.152 --> 37:24.894
Maybe.

37:24.938 --> 37:26.635
A little.

37:37.429 --> 37:39.169
We could try.

37:39.213 --> 37:41.607
Try what?

37:41.650 --> 37:44.697
Sex magick.

37:44.740 --> 37:48.570
I am sorry. No, I get it.

37:48.614 --> 37:51.094
I don't want you having to be
someone you're not for me.

37:51.138 --> 37:54.315
I don't want that, either.

37:54.359 --> 37:56.404
If you were worried about me
loving you so much

37:56.448 --> 37:57.927
that I would put up
with anything,

37:57.971 --> 38:00.278
clearly you can think again.

38:00.321 --> 38:03.629
Yeah? I don't want to share you.

38:03.672 --> 38:07.415
I mean it. I don't know
what I would do.

38:07.459 --> 38:09.219
The very thought of
someone else touching you

38:09.243 --> 38:10.636
makes me sick to my stomach.

38:27.957 --> 38:29.481
There you are.

38:29.524 --> 38:32.005
Chiang, I've got wonderful news.
I just spoke to Braxton...

38:32.048 --> 38:33.398
Someone's locked the gates.

38:33.441 --> 38:36.096
What?

38:38.054 --> 38:40.535
Sit the fuck down.

38:40.579 --> 38:42.972
Who else would Crowley
meet with in Berlin?

38:43.016 --> 38:44.409
I told you, I don't know.

38:44.452 --> 38:45.888
Did you ever meet
a British general

38:45.932 --> 38:48.500
named Fuller? My grandmother has a saying,

38:48.543 --> 38:51.894
"The cynic laughs at happiness
and winds up sad."

38:51.938 --> 38:54.636
I'm not sad.

38:54.680 --> 38:56.508
No, just pathetic.

38:56.551 --> 38:59.119
This connection you seek
between the Nazis and Crowley,

38:59.162 --> 39:01.513
it's ridiculous.

39:01.556 --> 39:04.080
Then why do you look so scared?

39:23.012 --> 39:26.015
I'm not a Nazi. I fled.

39:26.059 --> 39:29.628
I left it all behind.

39:39.725 --> 39:40.943
Susan.

39:42.423 --> 39:43.598
Susan?

39:44.773 --> 39:46.732
My God, what happened?

39:46.775 --> 39:47.950
Is everyone okay?

39:47.994 --> 39:49.212
Whose blood is this?

39:49.256 --> 39:51.432
I think Ernest is trying
to cross the abyss.

39:51.476 --> 39:53.826
No, that's impossible.
I never gave him the oath.

39:53.869 --> 39:55.131
No, but Jack did.

39:55.175 --> 39:58.396
Since you were too distracted
by other things.

39:58.439 --> 40:02.182
You have committed
a grave error.

40:02.225 --> 40:03.923
It doesn't just break our code,

40:03.966 --> 40:06.882
it could break a man's soul.

40:06.926 --> 40:08.754
I'll go and talk to him.

40:24.465 --> 40:26.424
Ernest?

41:01.546 --> 41:02.895
Hello, Jack.

41:02.938 --> 41:04.592
What are you doing?

41:08.640 --> 41:10.250
Don't.

41:10.293 --> 41:13.471
From a single spark

41:13.514 --> 41:16.604
all of creation was born.

41:21.087 --> 41:24.351
Don't try to stop me, Jack.

41:24.394 --> 41:27.006
My angel of fire beckons.

41:27.049 --> 41:28.616
Ernest, the angel wasn't real.

41:28.660 --> 41:30.357
I was trying to save
my damn life.

41:30.400 --> 41:32.794
Doesn't it feel good?

41:32.838 --> 41:34.535
No, lies only

41:34.579 --> 41:36.624
drag us down.

41:36.668 --> 41:39.148
The only way up is truth.

41:39.192 --> 41:43.501
Well, now you know,
so, please...

41:47.548 --> 41:49.115
You remember that first night?

41:49.158 --> 41:52.422
That mountain lion?

41:52.466 --> 41:56.209
You told me rockets were your
way to be free of this world.

41:59.734 --> 42:02.650
Well, this is mine.

42:14.836 --> 42:17.752
The war machine won't get you
where you need to go.

42:17.796 --> 42:19.449
You need to cut
yourself loose, get back

42:19.493 --> 42:21.533
on the only path that matters.
You're right, Ernest.

42:21.557 --> 42:23.802
Okay? I strayed,

42:23.845 --> 42:25.804
but I'll get back on it.

42:26.805 --> 42:30.025
Just... please.

42:30.069 --> 42:32.811
Give me the lighter.

42:32.854 --> 42:35.727
Ernest, please.

42:40.209 --> 42:42.951
I need you.

42:44.387 --> 42:46.955
You need to face your destiny.

42:46.999 --> 42:51.003
A man of fire should not be
bowing before a man of clay.

42:53.962 --> 42:56.182
It's time for you to go now.

42:58.227 --> 43:01.143
Ernest, wait.

43:02.928 --> 43:06.801
Ad astra per aspera.

43:06.845 --> 43:08.542
Don't do this.

43:08.586 --> 43:11.545
Love is the law.
Love under will.

43:16.506 --> 43:17.943
Fuck.

43:52.107 --> 43:54.109
Kelly, call the fire department.

44:17.045 --> 44:20.005
- Pasadena Police.
- Everybody step back.

44:21.571 --> 44:23.530
Folks, listen up.

44:23.573 --> 44:26.838
We have a warrant for
the arrest of Ernest Donovan.

44:26.881 --> 44:29.318
Spread out.
