She's Mae.

- And she's Dawn.

00:40.166 --> 00:43.709
to be an in-the-know Buffalo.

if you happen to see

00:45.542 --> 00:47.750
your parents around school.

00:53.500 --> 00:55.917

Oh, Mae, I'm super excited

01:01.917 --> 01:03.834
next Saturday.

So, with the big dance

coming up,

01:28.625 --> 01:31.417
this year's hot trend is

elaborate dance proposals,

01:31.458 --> 01:34.875

01:31.458 --> 01:34.875

What's the old people's take

01:47.000 --> 01:49.625
on dance-posals?

- Oh, I think they're sweet.

- Thanks.

I don't get it.

Back in my day,

01:54.458 --> 01:56.208
you just walked up to a girl,

01:56.250 --> 01:57.500
barely looked her in the eye,

01:56.250 --> 01:57.500
and just asked.

01:57.542 --> 01:59.125
- Well, it might've been nicer

01:59.166 --> 02:00.583
if you'd made a little more

01:59.166 --> 02:00.583
of an effort.

02:00.625 --> 02:02.291
- Well, I got the answer

02:00.625 --> 02:02.291
from you I wanted,

02:02.333 --> 02:03.625
without littering.

02:03.667 --> 02:05.625
Back to you, Dicky.

02:05.667 --> 02:07.750
- Thanks.

02:05.667 --> 02:07.750
Oh, you missed a spot.

02:07.792 --> 02:10.333
Now to Nicky

02:07.792 --> 02:10.333
with the Lowdown on Lunch.

02:10.625 --> 02:13.417
- Thanks, Dicky.

Today's menu:

02:13.458 --> 02:15.792
meatloaf with mashed potatoes

02:13.458 --> 02:15.792
and gravy.

02:15.834 --> 02:17.500
Now, this is a heavy dish,

02:17.542 --> 02:20.375
so rather than pairing

02:17.542 --> 02:20.375
with a fuller-bodied whole milk,

02:20.417 --> 02:24.166
I suggest going

02:20.417 --> 02:24.166
with a well-chilled skim.

02:24.208 --> 02:27.709
But, as always,

02:24.208 --> 02:27.709
my recommendation is

02:27.750 --> 02:29.875
pack you own lunch.

02:29.917 --> 02:31.875
Now Avery with the birthdays.

02:31.917 --> 02:35.458

Mae is clearly a better co-host
