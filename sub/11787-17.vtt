Before you knew it, I had enough money
for the down payment.

36:02.994 --> 36:07.033
When I called the realtor and he said
the place was still available...

36:07.207 --> 36:09.664
...I nearlyjumped out of my chair.

36:11.127 --> 36:14.494
My plan was to fly them there...

36:14.839 --> 36:16.955
...for a vacation.

36:18.009 --> 36:21.342
And tell them
that that house was a rental.

36:25.475 --> 36:28.558
And I know
on the last day of vacation...

36:28.728 --> 36:35.725
...Hailey would just look up at me
and tell me it's time to go home.

36:37.320 --> 36:42.690
But I would look back down at her
and I'd tell her:

36:44.327 --> 36:46.318
"We are home."

36:56.339 --> 36:58.716
Percy took that away from me.

37:03.388 --> 37:05.629
He made me into this.

37:11.563 --> 37:14.396
I'm going to go into his office...

37:17.026 --> 37:19.153
...and I'm gonna shoot him.

37:24.159 --> 37:26.525
If Percy goes down...

37:27.078 --> 37:29.239
...this country will never recover.

37:31.040 --> 37:33.531
Do you remember telling me that?

37:33.793 --> 37:35.203
I don't care.

37:35.378 --> 37:37.539
I don't believe you...

37:38.173 --> 37:40.710
...because you're stronger than that.

37:42.260 --> 37:45.093
You're the strongest person
I've ever met.

37:46.306 --> 37:50.424
You do the things
that other people won't do.

37:51.603 --> 37:56.973
You sacrifice and you dedicate your life
to people you know are innocent.

37:57.776 --> 38:00.984
I don't think you're capable
of not caring.

38:06.284 --> 38:12.280
We will find the rest of the black boxes
and then we will kill Percy.

38:14.083 --> 38:18.622
And he will not be able to do this
to anyone ever again.

38:21.299 --> 38:22.960
I lied to you.

38:25.804 --> 38:28.967
I didn't get the locations.

38:32.310 --> 38:34.426
I was coming here...

38:36.147 --> 38:38.138
...to double-cross you.

38:48.159 --> 38:49.615
Well...

38:52.747 --> 38:54.487
...you didn't.

39:12.684 --> 39:14.845
Did you think about
what we discussed?

39:15.019 --> 39:16.680
Yes.

39:18.523 --> 39:19.854
And?

39:20.567 --> 39:23.149
I'm with you 100 percent.

39:44.716 --> 39:46.422
You were right.

39:49.012 --> 39:50.092
No.

39:52.557 --> 39:54.513
Yeah, you were right.

39:57.937 --> 40:00.428
If I had just listened to you
five years ago...

40:03.902 --> 40:06.234
...things could have been different.

40:07.447 --> 40:09.733
Things will be different.
