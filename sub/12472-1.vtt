01:03.100 --> 01:06.800
Christmas comes but once a year

01:07.100 --> 01:10.700
For every girl and boy

01:11.600 --> 01:15.599
The laughter and the joy

01:15.600 --> 01:19.600
They find in each new toy

01:20.400 --> 01:24.400
I'll tell you of a little boy

01:24.600 --> 01:28.600
Who lives across the way

01:29.100 --> 01:33.100
This little fella 's Christmas

01:33.800 --> 01:37.100
Is just another day

03:08.000 --> 03:11.499
It was just before dawn

03:11.500 --> 03:14.199
One miserable morning

03:14.200 --> 03:16.000
In black '44

03:18.500 --> 03:23.400
When the forward commander
was told to sit tight

03:24.100 --> 03:28.500
When he asked that
his men be withdrawn

03:31.200 --> 03:33.899
And the generals gave thanks

03:33.900 --> 03:35.600
As the other ranks

03:35.700 --> 03:41.000
Held back the enemy tanks
for a while.

03:41.200 --> 03:43.500
And the Anzio bridgehead

03:44.200 --> 03:46.799
Was held for the price

03:46.800 --> 03:49.900
Of a few hundred ordinary lives

04:15.900 --> 04:18.200
He's the little boy

04:18.399 --> 04:24.000
That Santa Claus forgot

04:25.300 --> 04:27.400
And Goodness knows

04:27.900 --> 04:33.100
He didn 't want a lot

04:34.100 --> 04:36.300
He sent a note to Santa

04:38.700 --> 04:43.000
For some soldiers and a drum

04:43.600 --> 04:46.800
It broke his little heart

04:47.100 --> 04:51.600
When he found Santa hadn't come

04:52.600 --> 04:54.899
In the street he envies

04:54.900 --> 04:58.600
All those lucky boys

07:27.700 --> 07:30.199
So ya thought ya

07:30.200 --> 07:32.199
Might like to

07:32.200 --> 07:34.200
Go to the show

07:37.600 --> 07:41.599
To feel the warm thrill
of confusion

07:41.600 --> 07:44.800
That space cadet glow

07:46.500 --> 07:51.399
Tell me, is something
eluding you, sunshine

07:51.400 --> 07:55.899
Is this not what
you expected to see

07:55.900 --> 08:00.699
If you wanna find out
what's behind these cold eyes

08:00.700 --> 08:06.000
You'll just have to
claw your way through this disguise

10:33.800 --> 10:36.300
Mama loves her baby

10:39.000 --> 10:42.500
And Daddy loves you too

10:43.500 --> 10:49.100
And the sea may look
warm to you, babe

10:49.300 --> 10:52.200
And the sky may look blue

10:54.300 --> 10:59.399
Ooh, ooh, ooh

10:59.400 --> 11:01.500
Ooh, babe

11:05.200 --> 11:09.199
Ooh, ooh, ooh

11:09.200 --> 11:11.600
Baby blue

11:16.000 --> 11:21.499
Ooh, ooh, ooh

11:21.500 --> 11:26.500
Ooh, ooh, babe

11:28.000 --> 11:31.200
If you should go skating

11:31.900 --> 11:35.400
On the thin ice of modern life

11:37.700 --> 11:40.199
Dragging behind you

11:40.200 --> 11:42.700
The silent reproach

11:43.000 --> 11:47.500
Of a million tear-stained eyes

11:48.700 --> 11:53.400
Don 't be surprised
when a crack in the ice

11:53.700 --> 11:58.400
Appears under your feet

11:58.800 --> 12:04.400
You slip out of your depth
and out of your mind

12:04.700 --> 12:08.399
With you fear
flowing out behind you

12:08.400 --> 12:12.100
As you claw the thin ice

13:09.800 --> 13:15.200
Daddys flown across the ocean

13:19.300 --> 13:25.000
Leaving just a memory

13:29.000 --> 13:34.300
A snapshot in the family album

13:39.500 --> 13:45.000
Daddy, what else
did you leave for me?

13:51.300 --> 13:55.000
Daddy, what'd ya leave
behind for me?

13:59.200 --> 14:04.700
All in all it was
just a brick in the wall.

14:09.000 --> 14:15.200
All in all it was all
just bricks in the wall.

14:50.600 --> 14:53.199
- What?
- Will you put me on there?

14:53.200 --> 14:56.399
- Well, where's your mother, then?
- She's gone to the shops.

14:56.400 --> 14:57.400
Yes, all right.

14:59.900 --> 15:02.900
How's that then? Enjoying it?

15:09.200 --> 15:10.800
Lovely, lovely.

15:20.600 --> 15:22.900
Now off you go.
Go on.

15:25.900 --> 15:29.099
Now what have I told you about this?
What have I told you?

15:29.100 --> 15:31.381
Go on, go on now. Sling your hook.
Go on. Sling your hook.

17:32.100 --> 17:35.099
And kind old King George

17:35.100 --> 17:38.099
Sent Mother a note

17:38.100 --> 17:41.500
When he heard that Father was gone

17:43.700 --> 17:45.900
It was, I recall

17:46.200 --> 17:49.199
In the form of a scroll

17:49.200 --> 17:52.400
Gold leaf and all

17:54.700 --> 17:57.599
And I found it one day...

17:57.600 --> 18:01.099
In a drawer of old photographs...

18:01.100 --> 18:02.900
Hidden away.

18:04.800 --> 18:08.800
And my eyes still grow damp
to remember

18:09.100 --> 18:15.800
His Majesty signed
with his own rubber stamp.

18:17.400 --> 18:20.100
It was dark all around

18:20.400 --> 18:22.799
There was frost in the ground

18:22.800 --> 18:29.099
When the tigers broke free

18:29.100 --> 18:31.400
And no one survived

18:31.800 --> 18:37.800
From the Royal Fusiliers
Company C

18:40.100 --> 18:43.499
They were all left behind

18:43.500 --> 18:45.999
Most of them dead

18:46.000 --> 18:49.600
The rest of them dying

18:51.600 --> 18:55.000
And that's how the high command

18:55.300 --> 18:59.600
Took my daddy, from me.

19:59.000 --> 20:03.000
Did you see the frightened ones?

20:03.400 --> 20:07.900
Did you hear the falling bombs?

20:08.500 --> 20:13.199
Did you ever wonder why
we had to run for shelter

20:13.200 --> 20:19.500
When the promise of a brave new world
unfurled beneath the clear blue sky?

20:34.800 --> 20:38.600
Did you see the frightened ones?

20:38.900 --> 20:43.200
Did you hear the falling bombs?

20:43.800 --> 20:49.600
The flames are all long gone
but the pain lingers on.

20:52.600 --> 20:54.399
Good-bye

20:54.400 --> 20:56.400
Blue sky

20:57.300 --> 21:00.599
Good-bye, blue sky

21:00.600 --> 21:02.400
Good-bye

21:05.300 --> 21:07.100
Good-bye

21:14.100 --> 21:16.300
Wait for me, Pinky,
you rotten bleeder.

21:16.600 --> 21:19.100
- They're my bullets, ain't they?
- I don't know.

21:19.800 --> 21:23.299
Come on, Tubs.
It's great down in the tunnel.

21:23.300 --> 21:25.599
Don't you think
it'd be dangerous, Pinky?

21:25.600 --> 21:27.600
No. Don't be daft.

21:39.300 --> 21:42.600
- You all right, Tubs?
- Yeah. Hurt me knee a bit.

21:50.300 --> 21:51.999
- Come on.
- Na. It's too dangerous.

21:52.000 --> 21:56.000
- We'll wait for the train.
- Give me the torch.

22:05.200 --> 22:07.699
- Pinky! Here comes the train!

22:07.700 --> 22:12.000
- Get off the line,
you bloody idiot! Here it comes!

22:12.800 --> 22:16.000
- Pinky, get off the line!
Here it comes!

22:17.300 --> 22:19.000
- Pinky, get off the line!

22:36.600 --> 22:37.700
- You!

22:40.500 --> 22:44.399
- You!
Yes, you!

22:44.400 --> 22:46.500
- Stand still, laddie!

23:09.100 --> 23:11.100
When we grew up and went to school

23:11.700 --> 23:17.900
There were certain teachers who would
hurt the children anyway they could

23:20.600 --> 23:25.299
By pouring their derision
upon anything we did

23:25.300 --> 23:27.699
Exposing every weakness

23:27.700 --> 23:31.200
However carefully hidden
by the kids

23:32.100 --> 23:34.100
- What have we here, laddie?

23:34.600 --> 23:38.300
- Mysterious scribblings?
A secret code?

23:38.900 --> 23:41.100
- No. Poems, no less.

23:41.400 --> 23:43.100
- Poems, everybody!

23:43.700 --> 23:46.800
- The lad here reckons himself
a poet.

23:47.100 --> 23:50.099
- "Money, get back.
I'm all right, Jack.

23:50.100 --> 23:52.900
- Keep your hands off my stack.

23:53.300 --> 23:56.799
- New car, caviar,
four-star daydream.

23:56.800 --> 23:59.399
- Think I'll buy me
a football team."

23:59.400 --> 24:02.599
- Absolute rubbish, laddie!

24:02.600 --> 24:06.099
- Get on with your work.

24:06.100 --> 24:07.599
- Repeat after me:

24:07.600 --> 24:10.999
- An acre is the area
of a rectangle...

24:11.000 --> 24:13.299
- whose length is one furlong...

24:13.300 --> 24:15.799
- and whose width is one chain.

24:15.800 --> 24:18.199
But in this town it was well known

24:18.200 --> 24:22.200
When they got home at night
their fat and psychopathic wives

24:22.300 --> 24:26.000
Would thrash them
within inches of their lives

24:44.100 --> 24:49.700
We don 't need no education

24:53.500 --> 24:59.000
We don't need no thought control

25:02.500 --> 25:08.300
No dark sarcasm in the classroom

25:11.500 --> 25:16.900
Teacher, leave them kids alone

25:21.700 --> 25:28.700
Hey, teacher, leave them kids alone

25:31.000 --> 25:36.500
All in all it's just
another brick in the wall

25:37.800 --> 25:40.199
- Wrong! Do it again!

25:40.200 --> 25:44.900
All in all you're just
another brick in the wall

25:49.000 --> 25:53.399
We don 't need no education

25:53.400 --> 25:55.799
- If you don't eat your meat,
you can't have any pudding!

25:55.800 --> 25:59.699
We don't need no thought control

25:59.700 --> 26:02.699
- How can you have any pudding
if you don't eat your meat?

26:02.700 --> 26:05.999
No dark sarcasm in the classroom

26:06.000 --> 26:08.999
- You! Yes, you, laddie!

26:09.000 --> 26:11.599
- Poems, everybody.
The lad here reckons himself a poet.

26:11.600 --> 26:15.900
Teachers, leave them kids alone

26:22.000 --> 26:28.100
Hey, teacher, leave those kids alone

26:31.400 --> 26:37.200
All in all you're just
another brick in the wall

26:40.700 --> 26:46.300
All in all you're just
another brick in the wall

27:31.400 --> 27:36.200
We don 't need no education

27:49.400 --> 27:54.500
No dark sarcasm in the classroom

27:59.700 --> 28:03.999
- Again. An acre is the area
of a rectangle...

28:04.000 --> 28:06.499
- whose length is one furlong...

28:06.500 --> 28:09.900
- and whose width is one chain.

29:01.400 --> 29:06.700
Mother, do you think
they'll drop the bomb

29:17.400 --> 29:21.500
Mother, do you think
they'll like the song

29:34.400 --> 29:39.800
Mother, do you think
they'll try to break my balls

29:49.300 --> 29:52.800
Mother, should I build the wall

30:19.500 --> 30:22.800
Mother, should I run for president

30:36.200 --> 30:39.000
Mother, should I trust the government

30:52.500 --> 30:57.900
Mother, will they put me
in the firing line

31:07.200 --> 31:11.200
Mother, am I really dying

31:16.200 --> 31:21.100
Hush now, baby, baby
don't you cry

31:25.600 --> 31:30.700
Mama 's gonna make all of
your nightmares come true

31:30.800 --> 31:35.900
Mama 's gonna put
all of her fears into you

31:36.200 --> 31:41.200
Mama 's gonna keep you
right here under her wing

31:41.600 --> 31:46.400
She won 't let you fly
but she might let you sing

31:46.800 --> 31:54.200
Mama 's gonna keep baby
cozy and warm

31:56.600 --> 32:00.900
Ooooh, babe

32:02.800 --> 32:05.600
Ooooh, babe

32:07.900 --> 32:14.900
Ooh, babe, of course
Mama 's gonna help build the wall

32:47.500 --> 32:54.300
- Hello. Hello.
Is there anybody in there?

32:58.800 --> 33:00.300
- Do you remember me?

33:00.600 --> 33:03.000
- I'm the one
from the Registry Office.

33:13.000 --> 33:18.000
Mother, do you think
she's good enough

33:22.500 --> 33:25.700
For me

33:29.700 --> 33:34.700
And, Mother
do you think she 's dangerous

33:38.900 --> 33:41.400
To me

33:46.400 --> 33:51.000
Mother, will she tear
your little boy apart

33:57.000 --> 34:01.399
Ooooh, Ma

34:01.400 --> 34:05.400
Mother, will she break my heart

34:10.400 --> 34:15.900
Hush now, baby, baby
don't you cry

34:19.100 --> 34:24.100
Mama 's gonna check out
all your girlfriends for you

34:24.600 --> 34:29.400
Mama won 't let anyone
dirty get through

34:29.699 --> 34:35.099
Mama 's gonna wait up
until you get in

34:35.100 --> 34:39.900
Mama will always find out
where you've been

34:40.400 --> 34:47.400
Mama 's gonna keep baby
healthy and clean

34:50.100 --> 34:55.100
Oooh, babe

34:56.800 --> 34:59.800
Oooh, babe

35:01.400 --> 35:08.400
Ooh, babe
You'll always be baby to me

35:20.100 --> 35:25.300
Mother, did it need to be so high

35:48.100 --> 35:49.999
- Hello?
- Yes, a collect call...

35:50.000 --> 35:52.299
for Mrs. Floyd from Mr. Floyd.

35:52.300 --> 35:55.800
- Will you accept the charge
from the United States?

36:00.700 --> 36:03.499
- I wonder why he hung up. Is there
supposed to be someone else there...

36:03.500 --> 36:06.200
besides your wife, sir,
to answer?

36:08.800 --> 36:11.199
- Hello?
- This is United States calling.

36:11.200 --> 36:13.500
Are we reaching...

36:15.500 --> 36:19.500
See, he keeps hanging up,
and it's a man answering.

38:02.600 --> 38:06.600
What shall we use

38:07.100 --> 38:09.599
To fill

38:09.600 --> 38:13.600
The empty spaces

38:14.600 --> 38:16.600
Where waves

38:17.000 --> 38:19.599
Of hunger

38:19.600 --> 38:22.300
Roar

38:22.600 --> 38:26.000
Shall we set out across

38:26.300 --> 38:29.099
This sea

38:29.100 --> 38:32.799
Of faces

38:32.800 --> 38:36.699
In search of more

38:36.700 --> 38:41.300
And more applause

39:00.000 --> 39:04.699
Shall we buy a new guitar

39:04.700 --> 39:09.099
Shall we drive
a more powerful car

39:09.100 --> 39:13.699
Shall we work
straight through the night

39:13.700 --> 39:16.199
Shall we get into fights

39:16.200 --> 39:18.499
Leave the lights on Drop bombs

39:18.500 --> 39:23.399
Do tours of the East
Contract diseases

39:23.400 --> 39:25.499
Bury bones Break up homes

39:25.500 --> 39:27.699
Send flowers by phone

39:27.700 --> 39:29.999
Take to drink Go to shrinks

39:30.000 --> 39:32.699
Give up meat Rarely sleep

39:32.700 --> 39:34.699
Keep people as pets

39:34.700 --> 39:37.199
Train dogs Race rats

39:37.200 --> 39:39.399
Fill the attic with cash

39:39.400 --> 39:41.399
Bury treasure Store up leisure

39:41.400 --> 39:46.400
But never relax at all

39:47.400 --> 39:51.400
With our backs to the wall

40:25.100 --> 40:28.400
I am just a new boy

40:30.100 --> 40:35.099
A stranger in this town

40:35.100 --> 40:38.400
Where are all the good times

40:40.000 --> 40:43.800
Who 's gonna show this stranger around

40:55.500 --> 40:59.499
Ooooh

40:59.500 --> 41:02.800
I need a dirty woman

41:05.600 --> 41:09.600
Ooooh

41:09.800 --> 41:13.100
I need a dirty girl

41:15.600 --> 41:19.000
Will some woman in this desert land

41:20.800 --> 41:24.200
Make me feel like a real man

41:24.800 --> 41:29.500
Take this rock and roll refugee

41:30.800 --> 41:34.200
Ooh, babe, set me free

41:46.200 --> 41:50.199
Ooooh

41:50.200 --> 41:53.500
I need a dirty woman

41:56.500 --> 42:00.399
Ooooh

42:00.400 --> 42:03.700
I need a dirty girl

42:51.900 --> 42:55.899
Ooooh

42:55.900 --> 42:59.200
I need a dirty woman

43:01.900 --> 43:05.899
Ooooh

43:05.900 --> 43:09.300
I need a dirty girl.

43:40.000 --> 43:42.600
- Oh, my God.

43:43.000 --> 43:46.300
- What a fabulous room.

43:48.600 --> 43:52.000
- Are all these your guitars?

44:05.300 --> 44:07.000
- God.

44:07.600 --> 44:11.000
This place is bigger
than our whole apartment.

44:25.000 --> 44:28.300
- You like the tube, huh?

44:29.700 --> 44:33.000
Can I get a drink of water?

44:36.700 --> 44:40.000
- Can I get you a drink of water?

44:55.400 --> 44:58.700
- Oh, wow, look at this tub!

44:59.000 --> 45:02.400
Wanna take a bath?

45:13.000 --> 45:16.400
- What are you watching?

45:21.100 --> 45:24.400
- Hello? Hello?

45:31.700 --> 45:33.399
- You feeling okay?

45:33.400 --> 45:36.699
Day after day

45:36.700 --> 45:39.399
Love turns grey

45:39.400 --> 45:44.600
Like the skin of a dying man

45:46.700 --> 45:49.100
And night after night

45:49.400 --> 45:52.400
We pretend it's all right

45:53.100 --> 45:56.399
But I have grown older

45:56.400 --> 45:59.799
And you have grown colder

45:59.800 --> 46:06.100
And nothing is very much fun anymore

46:06.400 --> 46:12.600
And I can feel

46:13.100 --> 46:17.800
One of my turns coming on

46:19.900 --> 46:22.100
I

46:23.300 --> 46:25.500
Feel

46:26.500 --> 46:29.799
Cold as a razor blade

46:29.800 --> 46:33.099
Tight as a tourniquet

46:33.100 --> 46:37.800
Dry as a funeral drum

46:41.800 --> 46:43.799
Run to the bedroom

46:43.800 --> 46:49.100
In the suitcase on the left
you'll find my favorite axe

46:52.800 --> 46:57.199
Don 't look so frightened
This is just a passing phase

46:57.200 --> 47:00.500
One of my bad days

47:02.500 --> 47:05.800
Would you like to watch TV

47:06.200 --> 47:11.299
Or get between the sheets
Or contemplate the silent freeway

47:11.300 --> 47:13.500
Would you like something to eat

47:14.000 --> 47:17.300
Would you like to learn to fly

47:17.800 --> 47:23.200
Would ya
Would you like to see me try

47:58.000 --> 48:00.899
Would you like to call the cops

48:00.900 --> 48:03.999
Do you think it's time I stopped
- Next time, fuckers!

48:04.000 --> 48:12.000
Why are you running away

49:09.300 --> 49:12.000
Oooh, babe

49:15.000 --> 49:18.300
Don 't leave me now

49:26.300 --> 49:29.600
How could you go

49:39.100 --> 49:42.500
When you know how I need you

49:51.300 --> 49:56.499
To beat to a pulp
on a Saturday night

49:56.500 --> 50:00.400
Oh, babe

50:01.700 --> 50:05.000
Don 't leave me now

50:17.700 --> 50:22.000
How can you treat me this way?

50:25.000 --> 50:28.700
Running away

50:33.700 --> 50:37.000
Ooh, babe

50:39.700 --> 50:44.000
Why are you running away?

50:44.400 --> 50:52.400
Oooh, babe

50:56.100 --> 51:02.400
Oooh, babe

51:36.400 --> 51:40.400
I don 't need no arms around me

51:44.000 --> 51:50.000
And I don't need
no drugs to calm me

51:52.700 --> 52:00.100
I have seen the writing on the wall

52:01.100 --> 52:07.500
Don 't think I need anything at all

52:10.500 --> 52:12.499
No

52:12.500 --> 52:15.800
Don't think I need anything at all

52:23.800 --> 52:29.500
All and all it was all
just bricks in the wall

52:32.300 --> 52:38.000
All and all you were all
just bricks in the wall

53:07.200 --> 53:11.500
Good-bye, cruel world

53:11.900 --> 53:15.900
I'm leaving you today

53:16.400 --> 53:20.899
Good-bye, good-bye

53:20.900 --> 53:24.200
Good-bye

53:30.900 --> 53:34.900
Good-bye, all you people

53:35.600 --> 53:38.600
There's nothing you can say

53:38.900 --> 53:44.600
To make me change my mind

53:44.900 --> 53:47.900
Good-bye

54:13.600 --> 54:16.900
Is there anybody out there

54:26.300 --> 54:29.600
Is there anybody out there

54:37.900 --> 54:41.300
Is there anybody out there

54:52.300 --> 54:55.600
Is there anybody out there

57:57.500 --> 58:01.500
I've got a little black book
with my poems in

58:02.200 --> 58:06.699
Got a bag with a toothbrush
and a comb in

58:06.700 --> 58:14.200
When I'm a good dog
they sometimes throw me a bone in

58:15.200 --> 58:19.500
I got elastic bands
keeping my shoes on

58:19.800 --> 58:24.499
Got those swollen-hand blues

58:24.500 --> 58:31.200
I've got 13 channels of shit
on the TV to choose from

58:33.200 --> 58:36.500
I've got electric light

58:39.500 --> 58:42.499
And I've got second sight

58:42.500 --> 58:49.200
I've got amazing powers
of observation

58:53.500 --> 58:56.900
And that is how I know

58:57.500 --> 59:00.900
When I try to get through

59:02.500 --> 59:05.900
On the telephone to you

59:08.600 --> 59:11.900
There 'll be nobody home

59:18.600 --> 59:23.599
I got the obligatory Hendrix perm

59:23.600 --> 59:27.900
And the inevitable pinhole burns

59:28.600 --> 59:35.900
All down the front
of my favorite satin shirt

59:36.900 --> 59:40.900
I've got nicotine stains
on my fingers

59:41.400 --> 59:45.300
I've got a silver spoon on a chain

59:46.600 --> 59:54.300
Got a grand piano
to prop up my mortal remains

59:54.900 --> 01:00:00.300
I got wild staring eyes

01:00:00.600 --> 01:00:04.300
And I got a strong urge to fly

01:00:06.900 --> 01:00:12.600
But I got nowhere to fly to

01:00:18.600 --> 01:00:23.000
Oooh, babe

01:00:23.600 --> 01:00:28.600
When I pick up the phone

01:00:30.300 --> 01:00:35.300
There's still nobody home

01:00:40.300 --> 01:00:44.300
I've got a pair of Gohills boots

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:50.700
And I got fading roots

01:03:16.500 --> 01:03:23.800
Does anybody here
remember Vera Lynn

01:03:27.100 --> 01:03:30.099
Remember how she said

01:03:30.100 --> 01:03:33.799
That we would meet again

01:03:33.800 --> 01:03:38.200
Some sunny day

01:04:01.500 --> 01:04:03.200
Vera

01:04:03.800 --> 01:04:05.500
Vera

01:04:08.500 --> 01:04:13.500
What has become of you

01:04:16.900 --> 01:04:20.200
Does anybody else in here

01:04:20.500 --> 01:04:25.000
Feel the way I do

01:04:43.200 --> 01:04:49.600
Bring the boys back home

01:04:52.900 --> 01:04:59.200
Bring the boys back home

01:05:01.600 --> 01:05:04.600
Don 't leave the children

01:05:04.900 --> 01:05:09.600
On their own, no, no

01:05:13.900 --> 01:05:20.300
Bring the boys back home

01:05:22.900 --> 01:05:29.300
Bring the boys back home

01:05:31.900 --> 01:05:34.600
Don't leave the children

01:05:34.900 --> 01:05:38.900
on their own, no, no

01:05:43.300 --> 01:05:49.000
Bring the boys back home

01:06:03.600 --> 01:06:08.000
- You feeling okay?

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:18.000
Is there anybody out there

01:06:18.600 --> 01:06:20.300
- Fuck me.

01:06:21.300 --> 01:06:23.299
He's gone completely around
the bleedin' twist.

01:06:23.300 --> 01:06:26.700
You vicious bastard,
you never did like me, did you?

01:06:26.900 --> 01:06:29.000
Hello

01:06:29.500 --> 01:06:33.100
Is there anybody in there

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.100
Just nod if you can hear me

01:06:38.300 --> 01:06:41.700
Is there anyone at home

01:06:42.700 --> 01:06:44.800
Come on, now

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:49.100
I hear you're feeling down

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.999
Well, I can ease your pain

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:57.400
And get you on your feet again

01:06:57.700 --> 01:07:00.400
Relax

01:07:00.700 --> 01:07:04.000
I'll need some information first

01:07:05.400 --> 01:07:08.000
Just the basic facts

01:07:08.700 --> 01:07:12.000
Can you show me where it hurts

01:07:13.400 --> 01:07:19.700
There is no pain
you are receding

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:26.500
A distant ship smoke
on the horizon

01:07:28.400 --> 01:07:33.100
You are only coming through in waves

01:07:35.400 --> 01:07:41.700
Your lips move
But I can't hear what you're saying

01:07:43.100 --> 01:07:45.700
When I was a child

01:07:45.900 --> 01:07:48.700
I had a fever

01:07:50.700 --> 01:07:56.100
My hands felt just like two balloons

01:07:58.400 --> 01:08:02.400
Now I've got that feeling once again

01:08:03.100 --> 01:08:07.400
I can 't explain
you would not understand

01:08:07.800 --> 01:08:12.100
This is not how I am

01:08:13.800 --> 01:08:18.100
I

01:08:18.399 --> 01:08:23.100
Have become comfortably numb

01:08:55.500 --> 01:08:59.800
I

01:09:00.100 --> 01:09:05.800
Have become comfortably numb

01:09:06.800 --> 01:09:09.200
Okay

01:09:09.500 --> 01:09:12.800
Just a little pinprick

01:09:13.200 --> 01:09:16.800
There'll be no more Aaaaah

01:09:17.500 --> 01:09:20.500
But you may feel a little sick

01:09:21.500 --> 01:09:24.200
Can you stand up

01:09:24.800 --> 01:09:26.800
I do believe it's working

01:09:27.200 --> 01:09:28.799
Good

01:09:28.800 --> 01:09:32.500
That'll keep you going through the show

01:09:33.200 --> 01:09:36.200
Come on, it's time to go

01:09:37.500 --> 01:09:43.500
There is no pain
you are receding

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:51.700
A distant ship smoke
on the horizon

01:09:52.500 --> 01:09:57.500
You are only coming through in waves

01:09:59.500 --> 01:10:01.200
Your lips move

01:10:01.500 --> 01:10:05.900
But I can't hear what you're saying

01:10:07.200 --> 01:10:09.900
When I was a child

01:10:10.200 --> 01:10:14.500
I caught a fleeting glimpse

01:10:15.600 --> 01:10:20.900
Out of the corner of my eye

01:10:23.200 --> 01:10:26.200
I turned to look but it was gone

01:10:26.600 --> 01:10:31.600
I cannot put my finger on it now

01:10:31.900 --> 01:10:36.900
The child is grown
The dream is gone

01:10:37.900 --> 01:10:41.900
I

01:10:42.600 --> 01:10:48.900
Have become comfortably numb

01:14:24.500 --> 01:14:26.800
So ya thought ya

01:14:27.100 --> 01:14:30.500
Might like to go to the show

01:14:33.800 --> 01:14:37.499
To feel the warm thrill
of confusion

01:14:37.500 --> 01:14:41.800
That space cadet glow

01:14:43.800 --> 01:14:47.500
I got some bad news for you, sunshine

01:14:48.500 --> 01:14:52.499
Pink isn 't well.
He's, uh, back at the hotel

01:14:52.500 --> 01:14:55.799
And they sent us along
as a surrogate band

01:14:55.800 --> 01:15:01.200
Now tonight, we 're gonna find out
where you fans really stand

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:06.800
Are there any queers
in the audience tonight?

01:15:07.800 --> 01:15:12.200
Get 'em up against the wall
- Against the wall

01:15:12.500 --> 01:15:15.600
There's one in the spotlight
he don 't look right

01:15:17.500 --> 01:15:21.600
Have him up against the wall
- Against the wall

01:15:22.200 --> 01:15:26.200
And that one looks Jewish
And that one's a coon

01:15:26.900 --> 01:15:30.200
Who let all this riffraff
into the room

01:15:30.500 --> 01:15:33.199
There's one smoking a joint

01:15:33.200 --> 01:15:35.300
And that one's got spots

01:15:36.900 --> 01:15:42.900
If I had my way
I'd have all of you shot

01:16:31.900 --> 01:16:35.300
Hammer, Hammer, Hammer

01:16:35.600 --> 01:16:42.300
Hammer, Hammer, Hammer

01:17:14.600 --> 01:17:16.600
Run, run, run, run

01:17:17.300 --> 01:17:21.300
Run, run, run, run

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:31.699
You better make your face up
in your favorite disguise

01:17:31.700 --> 01:17:36.299
With your button-down lips
and your roller-blind eyes

01:17:36.300 --> 01:17:40.399
With your empty smile
and your hungry heart

01:17:40.400 --> 01:17:44.499
Feel the bile rising
from your guilty past

01:17:44.500 --> 01:17:48.999
With your nerves in tatters
as the cockleshell shatters

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:52.799
And the hammers batter down your door

01:17:52.800 --> 01:17:56.800
You better run run, run, run

01:17:57.700 --> 01:18:01.000
Run, run, run, run

01:18:08.700 --> 01:18:13.099
You better run all day
and run all night

01:18:13.100 --> 01:18:16.999
Keep your dirty feelings deep inside

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:21.499
And if you're taking
your girlfriend out tonight

01:18:21.500 --> 01:18:25.499
You'd better park the car
well out of sight

01:18:25.500 --> 01:18:29.499
'Cause if they catch you in
the back seat trying to pick her locks

01:18:29.500 --> 01:18:33.999
They're gonna send you back to Mother
in a cardboard box

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:38.700
You better run

01:19:08.100 --> 01:19:12.100
You cannot reach me now

01:19:14.400 --> 01:19:18.800
No matter how you try

01:19:19.400 --> 01:19:22.399
Good-bye, cruel world

01:19:22.400 --> 01:19:24.400
It's over

01:19:25.100 --> 01:19:27.800
Walk on by

01:19:32.400 --> 01:19:35.400
- Waiting
- To cut out the dead wood

01:19:35.800 --> 01:19:38.400
- Waiting
- To weed out the weaklings

01:19:38.800 --> 01:19:43.400
- Waiting - To smash in the
windows and kick in their doors

01:19:43.800 --> 01:19:48.100
- Waiting - For the final
solution to strengthen the strain

01:19:48.500 --> 01:19:52.800
- Waiting
- To follow the worms

01:19:55.500 --> 01:19:57.800
- Would you like to see
- Would you like to see

01:19:58.100 --> 01:20:01.100
Britannia rule again

01:20:03.500 --> 01:20:05.800
My friend

01:20:08.100 --> 01:20:13.800
All you need to do
is follow the worms

01:20:51.900 --> 01:20:58.400
Hammer! Hammer!

01:21:14.600 --> 01:21:19.300
Hammer! Hammer! Hammer!

01:21:23.200 --> 01:21:27.600
Stop!

01:23:17.300 --> 01:23:21.700
Stop.

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:28.300
I wanna go home

01:23:31.300 --> 01:23:36.700
Take off this uniform
and leave the show

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:42.400
But I'm waiting in this cell

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:46.400
Because I have to know

01:23:47.700 --> 01:23:50.400
Have I been

01:23:51.200 --> 01:23:57.000
Have I been guilty all this time

01:24:47.400 --> 01:24:50.599
Good morning, Worm, Your Honor

01:24:50.600 --> 01:24:52.700
The crown will plainly show

01:24:53.100 --> 01:24:56.799
The prisoner who now stands before you

01:24:56.800 --> 01:25:01.400
Was caught red-handed showing feelings

01:25:01.800 --> 01:25:06.800
Showing feelings
of an almost human nature

01:25:07.800 --> 01:25:10.400
This will not do

01:25:11.300 --> 01:25:13.760
Call the schoolmaster

01:25:13.900 --> 01:25:16.499
I always said he'd come to no good,

01:25:16.500 --> 01:25:18.999
and in the end, Your Honor

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:21.599
If they'd let me have my way

01:25:21.600 --> 01:25:25.100
I could've flayed him into shape

01:25:25.800 --> 01:25:28.799
But my hands were tied

01:25:28.800 --> 01:25:31.099
The bleeding hearts and artists

01:25:31.100 --> 01:25:34.799
Let him get away with murder

01:25:34.800 --> 01:25:37.800
Let me hammer him today

01:25:40.600 --> 01:25:43.599
Crazy

01:25:43.600 --> 01:25:49.200
Toys in the attic I am crazy

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:53.500
Truly gone fishing

01:25:56.200 --> 01:26:02.800
They must have taken my marbles away

01:26:03.200 --> 01:26:05.800
Crazy

01:26:06.500 --> 01:26:12.800
Toys in the attic He is crazy

01:26:17.300 --> 01:26:20.299
You little shit You're in it now

01:26:20.300 --> 01:26:23.499
I hope they throw away the key

01:26:23.500 --> 01:26:27.899
You should've talked to me
more often than you did

01:26:27.900 --> 01:26:31.399
But no
You had to go your own way

01:26:31.400 --> 01:26:35.199
Have you broken
any homes up lately

01:26:35.200 --> 01:26:38.499
Just five minutes, Worm, Your Honor

01:26:38.500 --> 01:26:41.900
Him and me alone

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:47.900
Babe

01:26:48.700 --> 01:26:50.999
Come to Mother, baby

01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:54.899
Let me hold you in my arms

01:26:54.900 --> 01:27:00.199
M'lud, I never wanted him
to get in any trouble

01:27:00.200 --> 01:27:03.899
Why'd he ever have to leave me

01:27:03.900 --> 01:27:08.300
Worm, Your Honor
let me take him home

01:27:09.900 --> 01:27:12.599
Crazy

01:27:12.600 --> 01:27:19.200
Over the rainbow I'm crazy

01:27:19.600 --> 01:27:23.900
Bars in the window

01:27:25.400 --> 01:27:29.900
There must have been a door there
in the wall

01:27:30.900 --> 01:27:32.899
When I came in

01:27:32.900 --> 01:27:35.400
Crazy

01:27:35.900 --> 01:27:42.600
Over the rainbow He is crazy

01:27:46.300 --> 01:27:52.199
The evidence before the court
is incontrovertible

01:27:52.200 --> 01:27:57.600
There 's no need
for the jury to retire

01:27:58.400 --> 01:28:01.099
In all my years of judging

01:28:01.100 --> 01:28:04.400
I have never heard before

01:28:04.600 --> 01:28:06.799
Of someone more deserving

01:28:06.800 --> 01:28:11.099
The full penalty of law

01:28:11.100 --> 01:28:13.099
The way you made them suffer

01:28:13.100 --> 01:28:17.000
Your exquisite wife and mother

01:28:17.200 --> 01:28:20.400
Fills me with the urge to defecate

01:28:23.800 --> 01:28:29.499
Since, my friend
you have revealed your deepest fear

01:28:29.500 --> 01:28:33.299
I sentence you to be exposed

01:28:33.300 --> 01:28:36.000
Before your peers

01:28:36.700 --> 01:28:39.000
Tear down the wall

01:28:39.700 --> 01:28:47.700
Tear down the wall!
Tear down the wall. Tear down the wall!

01:28:57.700 --> 01:29:05.700
Tear down the wall!
Tear down the wall!

01:31:45.500 --> 01:31:47.799
All alone

01:31:47.800 --> 01:31:51.200
Or in two's

01:31:51.500 --> 01:31:56.200
The ones who really love you

01:31:59.900 --> 01:32:02.299
Walk up and down

01:32:02.300 --> 01:32:05.200
Outside the wall

01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:15.000
Some hand in hand

01:32:15.900 --> 01:32:21.300
Some gathered together in bands

01:32:22.800 --> 01:32:28.199
The bleeding hearts
and the artists

01:32:28.200 --> 01:32:31.200
Make their stand

01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:39.499
And when they've given you their all

01:32:39.500 --> 01:32:42.399
Some stagger and fall

01:32:42.400 --> 01:32:46.900
After all, it's not easy

01:32:48.100 --> 01:32:50.699
Banging your heart

01:32:50.700 --> 01:32:55.300
Against some mad bugger's wall

01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:18.599
When they've given you their all

01:34:18.600 --> 01:34:20.799
Some stagger and fall

01:34:20.800 --> 01:34:25.400
After all, it's not easy
