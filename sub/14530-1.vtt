WEBVTT

00:14.647 --> 00:17.616
(baby cooing)

00:17.618 --> 00:18.684
(splutters)

00:21.087 --> 00:22.521
(men arguing
in various foreign languages)

00:24.624 --> 00:27.126
(argument continues, distantly)

00:31.131 --> 00:32.131
(gasps)

00:32.133 --> 00:33.732
Wake up.

00:33.734 --> 00:35.300
You hear that?
What?

00:35.302 --> 00:36.668
I hear something.

00:36.670 --> 00:38.370
There's some...
there's someone's in the house.

00:38.372 --> 00:40.439
Huh? What?
(shudders)

00:43.209 --> 00:45.577
MOTHER:
Oh, my God.

00:45.579 --> 00:46.745
Oh.

00:51.451 --> 00:52.384
(gasps)

00:53.787 --> 00:57.256
Caleb!
(sobbing): Caleb! My baby!

00:57.258 --> 01:00.392
(screaming):
Where's my baby?!

01:00.394 --> 01:04.163
(men arguing
in foreign languages)

01:04.165 --> 01:06.698
MOTHER:
Caleb!

01:26.686 --> 01:28.787
(slurps, ice rattles)

01:28.789 --> 01:29.755
(cup lands in trash can)

01:53.179 --> 01:55.247
It's early, Ryan.

01:56.749 --> 01:59.518
My wife thinks I'm sneaking out
of bed to have an affair.

01:59.520 --> 02:00.686
No, she doesn't.

02:00.688 --> 02:03.155
I sense an insult
in there somewhere.

02:03.157 --> 02:05.491
You want an update on
the Baltimore kidnapping?

02:05.493 --> 02:07.726
Yeah.
Police report.

02:07.728 --> 02:10.896
Baltimore PD states the
father heard foreign voices

02:10.898 --> 02:12.898
coming out of
the baby camera.

02:12.900 --> 02:16.468
Here's what's worth
getting out of bed for.

02:16.470 --> 02:19.338
Baby cameras are designed
to broadcast an infant's cries

02:19.340 --> 02:21.373
from their crib
to the parent's room.

02:21.375 --> 02:25.177
Question is, why are foreign
voices coming out of the camera?

02:25.179 --> 02:27.513
Huh. In-sec intrusion?

02:27.515 --> 02:29.815
I'd like to be sure.

02:29.817 --> 02:31.216
Case has been assigned.

02:31.218 --> 02:32.818
Myers and Wallace
over at Major Crimes.

02:32.820 --> 02:35.220
It needs to be reassigned.

02:35.222 --> 02:37.756
Any crime involving
electronic devices

02:37.758 --> 02:39.491
is, by definition, cyber.

02:39.493 --> 02:40.893
All right,
you think this kidnapping

02:40.895 --> 02:42.494
should fall
under cyber division,

02:42.496 --> 02:44.930
but you couldn't just call me
and tell me all this?

02:44.932 --> 02:46.465
Hey, the baby's missing.

02:46.467 --> 02:48.200
It's easier for you
to say "no" over the phone.

02:48.202 --> 02:49.835
All right. All right,
all right, all right.

02:49.837 --> 02:51.370
I will call off Myers
and Wallace.

02:51.372 --> 02:53.539
In the meantime,
just keep me posted.

02:58.178 --> 03:00.412
(phone ringing)

03:00.414 --> 03:02.915
ELECTRONIC VOICE:
Game paused.

03:02.917 --> 03:05.684
Sorry. Agent Mundo is currently
on the field of battle

03:05.686 --> 03:08.887
and can't talk to you on his
first day off in three weeks.

03:08.889 --> 03:11.223
Wake, soldier boy.
Duty calls.

03:11.225 --> 03:12.391
What do you got?

03:12.393 --> 03:13.692
Kidnapping. Baltimore.

03:13.694 --> 03:15.794
Point of contact is
a Detective Cho.

03:15.796 --> 03:17.396
Case file's on its way.

03:17.398 --> 03:18.463
I'll be right there.

03:22.902 --> 03:25.504
I put Caleb Reynolds' photo out
on the wires, notified TSA.

03:25.506 --> 03:30.275
It took me a bit, but finally
got Detective Cho on the horn.

03:30.277 --> 03:31.810
CSI has already
processed the perimeter.

03:31.812 --> 03:34.379
He's gonna hold the rest
of the crime scene for us.

03:34.381 --> 03:35.781
So he says.

03:35.783 --> 03:37.282
State Police,
Highway Patrol--

03:37.284 --> 03:38.550
already mobilized
checkpoints.

03:38.552 --> 03:39.785
Amber Alert has been
issued, as well.

03:39.787 --> 03:40.953
Mm.

03:42.255 --> 03:43.689
Good morning.

03:43.691 --> 03:45.824
(sighs)
Morning.

03:45.826 --> 03:48.560
(news broadcasts playing,
overlapping indistinctly)

03:51.798 --> 03:53.799
Where's my first
responder, Krumitz?

03:53.801 --> 03:55.467
Still trying to link him up.

03:55.469 --> 03:56.935
We're having issues
on their side.

03:56.937 --> 03:58.870
One second.

04:03.810 --> 04:04.977
I'm looking for...

04:04.979 --> 04:06.979
Ms. Ryan?

04:06.981 --> 04:09.815
Last time I heard your voice
was in a courtroom.

04:09.817 --> 04:11.750
Brody Nelson.

04:11.752 --> 04:13.685
I'm Special Agent Avery Ryan.

04:13.687 --> 04:15.587
Let me introduce
you to the team.

04:15.589 --> 04:16.922
Elijah Mundo.

04:17.724 --> 04:18.790
Daniel Krumitz.

04:20.560 --> 04:22.494
Raven Ramirez.

04:22.496 --> 04:23.495
I wish we had
time to chat.

04:23.497 --> 04:25.731
We don't. Sit. Stay.

04:25.733 --> 04:28.433
Detective Cho is on.

04:28.435 --> 04:30.869
Detective Cho, Agent Mundo.
We spoke on the phone.

04:30.871 --> 04:33.038
I'm gonna turn you
over to my boss,

04:33.040 --> 04:34.606
Special Agent Ryan.

04:34.608 --> 04:38.610
Tapped the Reynolds' land lines.
No ransom calls yet.

04:38.612 --> 04:41.346
Kid next door heard
a car speed off. That's it.

04:41.348 --> 04:42.514
What about the baby-cam?

04:42.516 --> 04:43.949
It was unplugged and secure.

04:43.951 --> 04:45.550
KRUMITZ:
Unplugged?!

04:45.552 --> 04:47.386
That's the quickest way
to lose all the data.

04:47.388 --> 04:49.655
Detective Cho,
please treat all hardware,

04:49.657 --> 04:52.891
including the baby-cam,
like a dead body.

04:52.893 --> 04:56.728
Don't touch it, don't move it
until we get there.

04:56.730 --> 05:00.832
Sorry. We didn't know the new
cyber protocol on a kidnapping.

05:00.834 --> 05:02.467
This is not just a kidnapping.

05:02.469 --> 05:05.537
Pack your bags.
We're heading to Baltimore.

05:16.349 --> 05:18.817
(indistinct conversation)

05:18.819 --> 05:20.686
I'll check the perimeter;
work outside in.

05:20.688 --> 05:22.788
Krumitz, head up to the nursery.
Nelson will be right in.

05:22.790 --> 05:25.757
What? You're sticking me
with newbie Nelson?

05:25.759 --> 05:27.326
The guy I busted?

05:27.328 --> 05:28.794
Hey, chubby, keep my name
out of your mouth.

05:28.796 --> 05:30.629
I'm not your braces.
RYAN: Enough.

05:30.631 --> 05:31.830
Nelson, zip it.

05:31.832 --> 05:33.865
Krumitz, game face.

05:33.867 --> 05:35.500
A baby's life's at stake.

05:35.502 --> 05:36.601
Focus.

05:40.673 --> 05:42.974
That's the guy that busted me?

05:42.976 --> 05:45.577
Krumitz-- he's the best
white hat hacker in the world.

05:45.579 --> 05:47.045
You hack it, he will come.

05:47.047 --> 05:49.381
So is that why
the judge sent me to you?

05:49.383 --> 05:51.116
The judge sent you to me
in the hopes

05:51.118 --> 05:53.452
you wouldn't spend the rest
of your life behind bars.

05:53.454 --> 05:55.554
The rules are simple.
Yeah, I know.

05:55.556 --> 05:57.356
Hack for good,
prove my worth?

05:57.358 --> 05:59.691
Obey all orders?
Yeah, I got it.

05:59.693 --> 06:01.426
You're forgetting
the fine print.

06:01.428 --> 06:04.830
One mistake--
federal pen, five years.

06:09.469 --> 06:11.536
(Mrs. Reynolds crying)

06:13.373 --> 06:17.509
Mr. and Mrs. Reynolds,
I'm Special Agent Avery Ryan.

06:18.745 --> 06:21.480
I'm here to get your son back.

06:25.918 --> 06:31.556
♪ I know you deceive me,
now here's a surprise ♪

06:33.159 --> 06:39.498
♪ I know that you have, 'cause
there's magic in my eyes ♪

06:39.500 --> 06:43.702
♪ I can see
for miles and miles ♪

06:43.704 --> 06:47.139
♪ I can see for miles

06:47.141 --> 06:50.876

06:50.878 --> 06:54.780

06:54.782 --> 06:58.049
♪ And miles... ♪

06:58.051 --> 07:00.118
♪ Oh, yeah. ♪

07:06.159 --> 07:07.893
Did you wake up
at any other point

07:07.895 --> 07:09.494
in the night
and check in on him?

07:09.496 --> 07:12.497
How many more questions
do we have to answer?

07:12.499 --> 07:14.466
Honey, she's just
doing her job.

07:14.468 --> 07:16.101
The more I know
about last night,

07:16.103 --> 07:17.736
the quicker we can
get Caleb back.

07:17.738 --> 07:19.871
I know how hard
this must be.

07:19.873 --> 07:21.072
You do?

07:21.074 --> 07:22.641
Do you have children?

07:22.643 --> 07:24.176
No.

07:24.178 --> 07:25.944
Then you don't know.

07:28.181 --> 07:30.215
I know...

07:30.217 --> 07:32.918
what it's like to be violated.

07:32.920 --> 07:34.152
To feel vulnerable.

07:34.154 --> 07:35.887
I took this job

07:35.889 --> 07:39.758
because I knew how
it felt to be in your position.

07:42.695 --> 07:44.596
MR. REYNOLDS:
Honey...

07:44.598 --> 07:46.565
Oh, I'm sorry.

07:52.205 --> 07:54.005
Whoa!

07:54.007 --> 07:55.140
Whoa!

07:55.142 --> 07:57.476
This is a crime scene. Glove up.

07:57.478 --> 08:00.078
Can't have your meat hooks
all over the evidence.

08:00.080 --> 08:02.047
What is your problem, man?

08:02.049 --> 08:03.815
You're my problem, man.

08:03.817 --> 08:05.817
It's bad enough
that Avery heads up this whole

08:05.819 --> 08:07.986
"it takes a hacker
to catch a hacker" program.

08:07.988 --> 08:11.056
I only support it because she's
my boss, and I love my job.

08:11.058 --> 08:14.993
Okay, look, I don't want
to get into any more trouble

08:14.995 --> 08:17.095
than I already am
because of you, all right?

08:17.097 --> 08:22.501
Ask questions,
listen to intelligent answers.

08:24.270 --> 08:26.271
So why hack into a baby-cam?

08:26.273 --> 08:29.274
Short answer?

08:29.276 --> 08:30.709
They were casing
the baby remotely.

08:30.711 --> 08:33.545
<i> They learned its habits--</i>
<i> when he sleeps,</i>

08:33.547 --> 08:35.514
<i> what time the parents</i>
<i> come in to feed...</i>

08:35.516 --> 08:38.283
And at the most
vulnerable hour... snatch.

08:38.285 --> 08:40.685
Damn.
Yeah.

08:56.802 --> 08:58.169
Security wire's cut.

08:58.171 --> 09:00.305
(gun firing over video game
speakers in distance)

09:01.707 --> 09:03.108
(lid clanks shut)

09:07.280 --> 09:09.648
(video game blipping)

09:09.650 --> 09:12.150
(gunfire in video game)

09:12.152 --> 09:13.218
(knocking on window)

09:13.220 --> 09:14.286
Hey, bud.

09:14.288 --> 09:15.954
Elijah Mundo, FBI.

09:15.956 --> 09:18.290
I'm sorry to interrupt you
in the field of battle.

09:18.292 --> 09:19.291
Are your parents home?

09:19.293 --> 09:20.592
They're upstairs.

09:20.594 --> 09:22.193
How come you're not
in school today?

09:22.195 --> 09:24.162
Parents kept me home
after what happened next door.

09:24.164 --> 09:25.330
Gotcha.

09:25.332 --> 09:26.965
<i>Assassinates,</i> huh?

09:26.967 --> 09:29.734
What level you on?

09:29.736 --> 09:32.137
12. Expert.

09:32.139 --> 09:33.872
It's hard.

09:33.874 --> 09:35.206
I know. Listen...

09:35.208 --> 09:37.275
Denny, is it?

09:37.277 --> 09:38.243
How'd you know my name?

09:38.245 --> 09:40.845
The police report.

09:40.847 --> 09:42.314
You told them
you heard a car speed off

09:42.316 --> 09:43.949
in the middle of the night.
Is there anything else

09:43.951 --> 09:46.084
I should know?

09:46.086 --> 09:50.121
Hey, us Assassinites,
we band together...

09:50.123 --> 09:52.290
And walk in silence.

09:52.292 --> 09:56.828
I just need some help trying to
figure out who took that baby.

09:56.830 --> 09:59.297
Yeah.

09:59.299 --> 10:02.133
MAN: Let's go! Let's go!
Let's get in the car.

10:02.135 --> 10:03.902
Get in the car!

10:03.904 --> 10:05.003
WOMAN: Go! Drive!
Get out of here!

10:05.005 --> 10:06.371
(engine starts)
Come on! Go!

10:06.373 --> 10:09.240
(engine revs, tires squeal)

10:09.242 --> 10:11.176
Thank you.

10:11.178 --> 10:13.111
Hey, I gave you
some intel.

10:13.113 --> 10:14.279
What about me?

10:14.281 --> 10:16.247
How do I get to level 13?

10:17.650 --> 10:19.017
Grab all five medic packs.

10:19.019 --> 10:21.286
It'll make you immortal
for the next three levels.

10:21.288 --> 10:22.354
And bazookas. All day.

10:22.356 --> 10:24.155
Sweet.

10:25.891 --> 10:27.325
You suffered a traumatic event.

10:27.327 --> 10:29.327
Your confusion
is understandable.

10:31.330 --> 10:32.664
The mind is very resilient.

10:32.666 --> 10:34.666
Memory is an incredible thing.

10:34.668 --> 10:36.334
Take a deep breath.

10:36.336 --> 10:39.270
(breathes deeply)

10:39.272 --> 10:43.642
Tell me, what did you hear?

10:43.644 --> 10:46.878
I heard voices, and they were
talking at the same time.

10:46.880 --> 10:48.046
What kind of voices?

10:48.048 --> 10:49.714
I heard Chinese-- I mean,

10:49.716 --> 10:51.182
it-it could've been Japanese.

10:51.184 --> 10:52.651
I-I don't know for sure.

10:52.653 --> 10:54.753
And I want to say
Middle Eastern.

10:54.755 --> 10:55.987
Like Arabic?

10:55.989 --> 10:58.390
And there was...
there was some German.

10:58.392 --> 11:00.258
And they were all
talking over each other.

11:00.260 --> 11:02.661
Kind of like
it was a fight.

11:02.663 --> 11:04.929
Oh, God, this is bad, isn't it?

11:04.931 --> 11:07.332
This is good. Those voices
weren't supposed to be there.

11:07.334 --> 11:09.401
This is a mistake.

11:09.403 --> 11:11.102
It's mistakes

11:11.104 --> 11:14.305
that are gonna lead us
to Caleb's kidnapper.

11:14.307 --> 11:16.374
This is very helpful.

11:17.410 --> 11:19.077
Good job.

11:19.079 --> 11:23.081
Natal-Cam. Wireless.
Model NC-825-P.

11:23.083 --> 11:25.950

11:25.952 --> 11:28.319

low-end model,

SD memory card,

11:29.356 --> 11:30.789

11:30.791 --> 11:32.457
Motion and sound?

11:32.459 --> 11:34.125
That's what it says.

11:34.127 --> 11:36.127
The card could've
recorded the kidnapping.

11:47.139 --> 11:48.973
They took the card with them.

11:48.975 --> 11:49.974
(wry laugh)

11:49.976 --> 11:52.043
Smart kidnappers.

11:52.045 --> 11:54.446
All right, so cut wires means
they bypassed the alarm systems.

11:54.448 --> 11:56.715
All right, let's get back
to what the kid saw--

11:56.717 --> 11:57.849
a woman running,
tires screeching.

11:57.851 --> 11:59.117
What does that tell you?

11:59.119 --> 12:00.351
Kidnappers are a team of two.

12:00.353 --> 12:02.754
Tires burning rubber,
behaviorally, skews male.

12:02.756 --> 12:04.289
Babies are high maintenance.

12:04.291 --> 12:06.157
I'm thinking the female
kidnapper grabbed the baby.

12:06.159 --> 12:08.460
The male was the getaway driver.
Did you just use

12:08.462 --> 12:10.395
the word "behaviorally"?

12:10.397 --> 12:13.298
Working with you,
I can't help it.
Modify the BOLO.

12:13.300 --> 12:16.801
We're looking
for a kidnapping team now.

12:21.874 --> 12:23.875
What are you guys doing?

12:23.877 --> 12:26.077
Confiscating your devices.

12:26.079 --> 12:28.246
Faraday bags block
the kidnappers

12:28.248 --> 12:30.448
from communicating
with your devices.

12:30.450 --> 12:33.752
Second we zip 'em up, it's like
locking 'em in a lead vault.

12:36.522 --> 12:38.923
Well, what if the kidnappers try
to call? It'll go to voicemail!

12:38.925 --> 12:41.526
They could hurt Caleb!
We've secured
your land lines.

12:41.528 --> 12:43.461
They're being monitored 24/7.

12:43.463 --> 12:47.465
Uh, we're missing one, A.
Only one cell here.

12:50.469 --> 12:53.004
Don't cry, Mom.
I'll keep you posted.

12:54.940 --> 12:56.474
Your mom okay?

12:56.476 --> 12:58.409
Here. Sorry.

12:58.411 --> 13:00.411
Don't be sorry.

13:00.413 --> 13:03.815
Any other calls you need to make
before I lock it up?

13:07.520 --> 13:08.553
No, I'm-I'm good.

13:08.555 --> 13:11.422
Oh, there's one more thing.

13:11.424 --> 13:13.925
I need a DNA sample
from you and your husband.

13:13.927 --> 13:15.994
Standard protocol.

13:19.565 --> 13:21.566
When's the last time
you breast-fed Caleb?

13:21.568 --> 13:23.568
Midnight.

13:23.570 --> 13:25.804
Why?

13:28.941 --> 13:33.011
It's the best way
to get a DNA sample of your son.

13:45.524 --> 13:48.059
Why are you putting
the baby-cam away?

13:48.061 --> 13:50.128
Hardware's clean.
I'm bagging it for evidence.

13:50.130 --> 13:52.430
Didn't bear any fruit.

13:52.432 --> 13:55.099
Well, all I got
is green code here.

13:55.101 --> 13:57.368
First five devices are clean.
Now, if Mom's

13:57.370 --> 13:58.870
comes back the same way,

13:58.872 --> 14:01.272
we struck out here, too.

14:01.274 --> 14:04.309
KRUMITZ:
Oop! There's malware.

14:11.617 --> 14:12.617
KRUMITZ:
We found a RAT.

14:12.619 --> 14:14.853
You found a RAT.

14:14.855 --> 14:17.322
Remote Access Trojan.
Spy software.

14:17.324 --> 14:19.524
Available anywhere on the
surface net.

14:19.526 --> 14:22.527
Basically, anybody
with half a brain can use it.

14:22.529 --> 14:24.529
Of all the devices,
the only one infected

14:24.531 --> 14:27.565
was Fran Reynolds' laptop?

14:27.567 --> 14:30.101
RAT software looks
for specific prompts.

14:30.103 --> 14:31.502
What did the user tag?

14:31.504 --> 14:34.072
What did he want to see?

14:38.477 --> 14:40.545
NELSON:
<i> Everything tagged "Caleb"...</i>

14:40.547 --> 14:43.882
<i> ...or "baby."</i>

14:47.319 --> 14:50.989
<i> The RAT tracked</i>
<i> every e-mail sent.</i>

14:50.991 --> 14:53.258
<i> Whatever she sent,</i>

14:53.260 --> 14:55.560
<i> he saw.</i>

14:55.562 --> 14:57.295
Somebody outside
the Reynolds family

14:57.297 --> 14:59.430
is way too
interested in Caleb.

14:59.432 --> 15:03.268
Krum, pull up Fran Reynolds'
phone records.

15:03.270 --> 15:04.936
MUNDO:
What are you thinking?

15:05.905 --> 15:08.273
Right before the mom
gave up her phone,

15:08.275 --> 15:10.275
I saw her sneak-talking.

15:10.277 --> 15:13.077
All right, her last call
was from the 410 area code.

15:13.079 --> 15:14.212
Baltimore.

15:15.247 --> 15:16.681
Krum, do a reverse look-up.

15:19.118 --> 15:20.151
Harbor Boat Restoration.

15:20.153 --> 15:22.654
Nelson, check for frequency.

15:22.656 --> 15:24.455
Right.

15:26.626 --> 15:30.261
21 calls to that number
in the last two weeks,

15:30.263 --> 15:31.596
all after midnight.

15:31.598 --> 15:33.498
She was having an affair.

15:33.500 --> 15:36.100
Where are my DNA results?
You beat me to it.

15:36.102 --> 15:38.569
Fran Reynolds' husband
is not the father.

15:38.571 --> 15:42.040
Looks like the biological father
works at the boat company.

15:51.083 --> 15:52.951
(baby crying)

15:52.953 --> 15:55.019
(whispering):
We're not waiting for backup.

16:07.967 --> 16:10.201
(baby crying)

16:11.603 --> 16:12.971
FBI!

16:12.973 --> 16:14.605
Bill Hookstraten, don't move!
Don't shoot!

16:14.607 --> 16:15.974
Don't shoot!

16:15.976 --> 16:18.710
On your knees!
RYAN: Hand me the baby.

16:18.712 --> 16:20.311
Just d-don't hurt him.

16:20.313 --> 16:23.047
Give me your hands.
Cross your ankles.

16:25.617 --> 16:27.518
Something's not right.

16:28.754 --> 16:31.689
Baby okay?

16:34.626 --> 16:36.427
Oh, my God.
There's no freckle.

16:36.429 --> 16:38.062
It's not Caleb.

16:42.701 --> 16:44.569
What do you mean I'm the rat?

16:44.571 --> 16:46.504
You hacked
into Fran Reynolds' computer.

16:46.506 --> 16:48.506
We tracked your IP address
to this address,

16:48.508 --> 16:50.441
and we know from
the DNA test results

16:50.443 --> 16:53.044
that Mr. Reynolds is not
Caleb's biological father.

16:53.046 --> 16:54.212
Fran and I

16:54.214 --> 16:56.014
had an affair.
Got pregnant.

16:56.016 --> 16:57.382
And as much as she talks
about leaving her husband,

16:57.384 --> 17:00.718
We argue all the time on
the phone about me seeing Caleb.

17:00.720 --> 17:03.621
a lawyer.
So I bought some software

17:03.623 --> 17:05.390
so I could see my kid.

17:05.392 --> 17:07.725
You've only seen him
on the Internet.

17:07.727 --> 17:10.762
Didn't you happen to notice
he had a distinctive freckle

17:10.764 --> 17:13.531
on his right cheek?

17:13.533 --> 17:15.333
So tell us,
whose baby is this?

17:16.301 --> 17:18.069
If it's not Caleb, I don't know.

17:18.071 --> 17:20.471
Then how did this Baby Doe
end up here?

17:20.473 --> 17:22.473
Fran called me
in the middle of the night

17:22.475 --> 17:24.409
to give me the bad news.

17:24.411 --> 17:25.543
She was insistent

17:25.545 --> 17:26.677
that I not come over.

17:26.679 --> 17:29.080
Then I got
this strange phone call...

17:29.082 --> 17:30.114
(phone ringing)

17:30.116 --> 17:32.483
<i> ...three hours ago. </i>
Hello?

17:32.485 --> 17:34.152
MAN:
Bill Hookstraten?
Speaking.

17:34.154 --> 17:35.820
We know
you're Caleb Reynolds' father.

17:35.822 --> 17:37.755
We have him.
Call the cops, he dies.

17:37.757 --> 17:39.824
We're willing to sell him
to you for a price.

17:39.826 --> 17:42.760
<i> They said they wanted $75,000.</i>

17:42.762 --> 17:44.095
Paid cash...

17:44.097 --> 17:46.497
then they gave me the baby.

17:46.499 --> 17:48.332
The kidnappers,
were they foreigners?

17:48.334 --> 17:49.634
Speak with
foreign accents?

17:49.636 --> 17:52.470
No. They were as American
as it gets.

17:52.472 --> 17:54.639
He was rough.
She was on the trashy side.

17:56.675 --> 17:58.342
Here's what's troubling me.

17:58.344 --> 18:00.211
How could two complete strangers

18:00.213 --> 18:02.280
know about your
secret with Fran?

18:02.282 --> 18:06.084
And that you've never
seen your son before?

18:06.086 --> 18:06.851
Honestly...

18:06.853 --> 18:09.520
I have no idea.

18:13.759 --> 18:15.693
AVERY:<i> So let's say</i>
<i> that the kidnappers</i>

18:15.695 --> 18:17.762
did steal Baby Doe and Caleb.

18:17.764 --> 18:20.731
Why sell Hookstraten
the wrong baby?

18:20.733 --> 18:23.868
Okay. Maybe this bait and switch
was on purpose.

18:23.870 --> 18:26.270
They know
Hookstraten is desperate.

18:26.272 --> 18:27.672
He buys the wrong baby.

18:27.674 --> 18:31.209
The kidnappers turn around
and sell him the real one

18:31.211 --> 18:32.243
but for more money.

18:32.245 --> 18:33.845
I don't know.
It doesn't add up.

18:33.847 --> 18:36.314
No, I know.

18:36.316 --> 18:38.850
It doesn't add up.
None of it adds up because...

18:38.852 --> 18:41.752
how can a second baby go missing
and nobody even phones it in?

18:41.754 --> 18:42.854
Well, law enforcement,

18:42.856 --> 18:44.722
somewhere,
must've dropped the ball.

18:44.724 --> 18:46.524
We should've been notified
by now.

18:46.526 --> 18:48.659
All right, I will put it out
on NLETS again.

18:48.661 --> 18:50.595
We go wider, we just cover
the whole country,

18:50.597 --> 18:52.530
and if nothing pops,
we contact the media.

18:52.532 --> 18:53.631
What's your next move?

18:53.633 --> 18:55.766
I'm going to change a diaper.

18:55.768 --> 18:58.336
A diaper.

18:58.338 --> 19:00.505
RYAN:
Oh, ooh...!

19:03.642 --> 19:05.643
Someone's got
some pee-pee.

19:05.645 --> 19:07.645
Well, don't worry,
we'll take care of this.

19:07.647 --> 19:11.849
Now, mister, you'll never
remember this moment,

19:11.851 --> 19:14.485
but I will.

19:14.487 --> 19:15.920
Most people

19:15.922 --> 19:17.855
don't know this...

19:17.857 --> 19:22.660
but diaper edges
are built-in print catchers.

19:23.629 --> 19:26.697
And if the woman who changed you

19:26.699 --> 19:30.868
can lead me back
to her boss...

19:30.870 --> 19:36.807
her big bad wolf of a boss...

19:36.809 --> 19:38.342
then I will huff

19:38.344 --> 19:39.810
and I will puff

19:39.812 --> 19:41.579
and I will blow

19:41.581 --> 19:45.583
the target's house...

19:45.585 --> 19:47.952
down.

19:47.954 --> 19:51.422
MUNDO: Avery, CTOC just
got back to us on your print.

19:51.424 --> 19:53.925
Hey! Yo.

19:53.927 --> 19:55.259
That the female kidnapper?

19:55.261 --> 19:56.827
Victoria Shala.

19:56.829 --> 19:58.696
25. No known address.

19:58.698 --> 20:01.933
Priors for prostitution.
Two DUIs. She's a lush.

20:01.935 --> 20:03.968
Have Nelson pull
her online presence.

20:03.970 --> 20:06.871
I want to know
who she's running with.

20:08.907 --> 20:12.877
FriendAgenda
is no friend to Vicky.

20:12.879 --> 20:15.246
She's as social as it gets.

20:15.248 --> 20:17.381
Best thing that's ever happened
to law enforcement.

20:17.383 --> 20:19.750
Yep. That's exactly why
I stay off of it.

20:19.752 --> 20:21.352
Figure that's the first
place you guys look

20:21.354 --> 20:22.687
to bust guys like me.

20:22.689 --> 20:24.855
We have plenty of ways
to catch guys like you.

20:24.857 --> 20:26.924
But until
you're one of us,

20:26.926 --> 20:28.993
that's for us to know
and for you to find out.

20:28.995 --> 20:31.262
Baby Face Nelson.

20:31.264 --> 20:32.296
Baby Face what?

20:32.298 --> 20:33.431
Mm-mm-mm.

20:36.401 --> 20:37.969
See a pattern?

20:37.971 --> 20:40.638
NELSON:
You know what, I do.

20:40.640 --> 20:42.607
Everything is
tagged "Ricky."

20:43.308 --> 20:45.009
RAMIREZ:
Richard Scaggs,

20:45.011 --> 20:47.445
31, born Niagara, New York.

20:47.447 --> 20:50.448
They're both from Niagara.
That's how they know each other.

20:50.450 --> 20:51.616
What are you doing?

20:51.618 --> 20:53.417
I know the type.

20:53.419 --> 20:56.554
Idiots like Ricky are all
about cars, bars and guitars.

20:56.556 --> 20:58.289
The neighbor kid did say
he heard

20:58.291 --> 21:00.524
tires peeling out.
Tires.

21:03.996 --> 21:05.930
We're looking for a blue Camaro.

21:05.932 --> 21:07.898
Yeah, we are.

21:07.900 --> 21:09.834
I know we are.

21:09.836 --> 21:11.802
According to Hookstraten,
Ricky and Vicky blew out

21:11.804 --> 21:13.537
of Harbor Boat Restoration
two hours ago.

21:13.539 --> 21:14.972
How far could they have gone?

21:14.974 --> 21:16.274
Bring up the map.

21:16.276 --> 21:17.375
We know from

21:17.377 --> 21:19.043
Vicky's rap sheet
she had two DUIs.

21:19.045 --> 21:20.444
She's a drinker.
They're gonna look for a bar.

21:20.446 --> 21:21.846
And with 75 in
cash in the trunk,

21:21.848 --> 21:24.515
the last thing they want to do
is get pulled over.

21:24.517 --> 21:27.018
Starting at Harbor
Boat Restoration,

21:27.020 --> 21:28.619
take out all left-hand turns.

21:28.621 --> 21:29.887
No risk for a car accident.

21:29.889 --> 21:31.822
They don't want to have
to call the police.

21:31.824 --> 21:33.691
They're going
to stick to surface roads,

21:33.693 --> 21:35.459
drive just below
the speed limit.

21:35.461 --> 21:36.794
Omit all highways.

21:36.796 --> 21:39.730
MUNDO: Search area just
got a lot smaller.

21:39.732 --> 21:42.667
Evolutionary survival skills
will instinctively take them

21:42.669 --> 21:43.934
to higher ground.

21:43.936 --> 21:47.638
Change the view to topography.

21:47.640 --> 21:51.475
That will takes them
down to Shookstown Road.

21:51.477 --> 21:53.911
We are looking for a bar near

21:53.913 --> 21:55.780
Five Forks,
Blue Ridge Mountains.

21:55.782 --> 21:57.782
MUNDO:
<i> And a blue Camaro.</i>

21:57.784 --> 22:00.384
(music blaring from inside bar)

22:03.655 --> 22:06.057
FBI! Stop right there! Hands up!
What the hell is this?

22:06.059 --> 22:09.860
Put your hands on your head!
Step away from the car!

22:09.862 --> 22:13.731
Step away and put my hands
behind my head at the same time?

22:13.733 --> 22:15.032
Hilarious.

22:15.034 --> 22:17.835
Where is Caleb Reynolds?

22:17.837 --> 22:20.671
RICKY: Hey, you can't
go in my car, man.

22:20.673 --> 22:21.872
I have rights.

22:21.874 --> 22:23.040
Probable cause.

22:23.042 --> 22:26.577
Where's the other one?
No, don't go in there!

22:30.682 --> 22:31.849
No baby.

22:34.419 --> 22:36.921
Plenty of cash, though.

22:36.923 --> 22:38.556
$75,000, right?

22:38.558 --> 22:39.924
You can't take that money.

22:39.926 --> 22:41.058
That's our ticket out.

22:41.060 --> 22:42.693
To a new life.

22:42.695 --> 22:44.362
Where the hell
is Caleb Reynolds?

22:44.364 --> 22:45.029
I don't know.

22:45.031 --> 22:47.565
Sniper! Get down!

22:47.567 --> 22:49.066
Why'd they kill her, man?
MUNDO: Get down!

22:49.068 --> 22:50.534
(grunts)

22:54.606 --> 22:57.875
(motorcycle engine starts)

22:57.877 --> 23:00.478
(engine revving)

23:29.808 --> 23:32.643
Yes, this is Agent Mundo
calling to report

23:32.645 --> 23:37.715
Yeah, I'm okay, but the other
guy's gonna need a body bag.

23:37.717 --> 23:39.483
It's gonna be tough to get
any I.D. on this guy.

23:39.485 --> 23:42.119
His fingerprints are burned off.

23:42.121 --> 23:44.889
No memory card, but
here's Vicky's cell.

23:44.891 --> 23:46.557
Brand-new burner cell.

23:46.559 --> 23:48.526
Want to bet this is how
the sniper found 'em?

23:48.528 --> 23:50.027
They GEO-tracked 'em.

23:50.029 --> 23:51.562
Three new entries on this phone.

23:51.564 --> 23:54.165
One is the call to Hookstraten.
Confirms his story.

23:54.167 --> 23:56.801
Two entries on a GPS app.

23:56.803 --> 23:58.569
Last entry
is Hookstraten's place.

23:58.571 --> 24:00.070
The first entry?

24:00.072 --> 24:01.772
Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.

24:01.774 --> 24:04.442
1232 Samuel Drive.

24:04.444 --> 24:06.143
This is likely Baby Doe's home.

24:06.145 --> 24:08.512
I'm calling Harrisburg PD.

24:12.451 --> 24:14.518
Here we go.

24:14.520 --> 24:17.588
SD memory card,
courtesy of Natal-Cam.

24:17.590 --> 24:21.992
(overlapping conversation
in various languages)

24:21.994 --> 24:23.093
Foreign voices.
Yeah.

24:23.095 --> 24:25.229
Definitely German.
Yeah.

24:25.231 --> 24:27.498
(overlapping conversation
in various languages)

24:30.202 --> 24:32.203
MUNDO:
Chinese and Arabic.

24:32.205 --> 24:34.238
All right, from what I can
make out, it sounds like

24:34.240 --> 24:36.207
the guy is saying something
about 565,000 Riyal.

24:36.209 --> 24:38.108
Riyals--
that's Saudi currency.

24:38.110 --> 24:39.677
Sounds heated, competitive.

24:39.679 --> 24:41.111
The German and

24:41.113 --> 24:42.746
the Saudi guy go back and forth,

24:42.748 --> 24:44.181
throwing all kinds
of numbers around.

24:44.183 --> 24:46.116
Looks like they're bidding.

24:46.118 --> 24:48.185
(men conversing in various
foreign languages)

24:55.627 --> 24:56.627
MAN:
<i> Mubar!</i>

24:56.629 --> 24:58.195
<i> "Mubar."</i>

24:58.197 --> 24:59.830
Means "sold" in Arabic.

24:59.832 --> 25:01.565
It's an auction.

25:01.567 --> 25:03.634
It's an online baby auction.

25:09.941 --> 25:12.142
Oh, those poor parents.

25:12.144 --> 25:14.979
They buy a baby-cam
to protect their child.

25:14.981 --> 25:18.249
It's the very thing
that gets him abducted.

25:19.618 --> 25:22.219
That is truly horrifying.

25:22.221 --> 25:26.257
Okay, here we go.

25:26.259 --> 25:29.527
All languages translated
to English.

25:29.529 --> 25:30.628
Play it.

25:30.630 --> 25:31.962
MAN: Next baby up--

25:31.964 --> 25:34.298
six months old, boy, American.

25:34.300 --> 25:37.167
you're responsible
for language translation

25:37.169 --> 25:38.302
and currency conversion.

25:38.304 --> 25:39.637
Highest bidder wins.

25:39.639 --> 25:41.005
Opening bid, 100,000 American.

25:41.007 --> 25:44.208
CHINESE BIDDER:
775,120 Hong Kong dollar!

25:44.210 --> 25:45.209
MAN 2:
$800,000.

25:45.211 --> 25:46.677
MAN 3:
900,000 Riyad!

25:46.679 --> 25:47.945
MAN: Sold at 120,000...

25:47.947 --> 25:49.980
MUNDO: Our bad guy's
a good businessman.

25:49.982 --> 25:51.849
He understands
supply and demand.

25:51.851 --> 25:53.551
Try adopting
an infant these days.

25:53.553 --> 25:55.119
Intensive screening,

25:55.121 --> 25:57.288
two-year waiting list,
lawyer bills.

25:57.290 --> 25:59.590
Well, he found a way
to short-track it.

25:59.592 --> 26:02.059
We're thinking he targeted
desperate parents online.

26:02.061 --> 26:04.695
He surfed legitimate
international adoption sites,

26:04.697 --> 26:06.730
lured them to his
own private network.

26:06.732 --> 26:09.700
Yeah, well,
key word-- desperate.

26:09.702 --> 26:12.336
(phone rings)
He sold them a dream.
Instant family.

26:12.338 --> 26:14.338
Sifter.

26:14.340 --> 26:16.774
What?

26:16.776 --> 26:19.243
Wh... Where?

26:19.245 --> 26:21.245
I'll get back to you.

26:21.247 --> 26:23.314
Avery, a word.

26:27.886 --> 26:29.954
Hard as this is to believe...

26:32.591 --> 26:35.159
...two more babies
went missing last night.

26:35.161 --> 26:38.696
Springfield, Mass;
Flushing, New York.

26:38.698 --> 26:39.763
Both male.

26:39.765 --> 26:42.232
Both parents had Natal-Cams.

26:42.234 --> 26:45.102
Now you're telling me we
have three babies in the wind?

26:45.104 --> 26:47.838
Strike one--
the Reynolds baby-cam is clean.

26:47.840 --> 26:50.908
Strike two-- their devices did
not contribute to the intrusion.

26:50.910 --> 26:54.612
I don't want a third strike,
so let's get Krumitz.

26:54.614 --> 26:57.648
Get him on a plane
to Natal-Cam headquarters.

26:57.650 --> 26:59.283
We gotta figure out
how that target

26:59.285 --> 27:01.385
got into those
cameras remotely,

27:01.387 --> 27:03.621
or this is just the beginning.

27:07.859 --> 27:10.861
How long has your source code
been like this?

27:14.633 --> 27:19.203
You have a vulnerability in your
multiview function, you idiot.

27:19.205 --> 27:20.638
They told me not to talk to you.

27:20.640 --> 27:24.041
Your source code's
telling me how they got in.

27:25.410 --> 27:28.045
You thought "patch and pray" was
gonna make the problem go away?

27:29.014 --> 27:30.414
How many baby-cams
are we talking?

27:30.416 --> 27:31.915
45,000.

27:31.917 --> 27:34.018
45,000...?!

27:34.020 --> 27:36.086
And you didn't say anything?

27:36.088 --> 27:38.188
There is a bad guy out there

27:38.190 --> 27:41.125
who's found the weakness
in your source code,

27:41.127 --> 27:43.027
and he's set up his own online
shopping network for babies,

27:43.029 --> 27:44.361
and you didn't say anything!

27:44.363 --> 27:46.397
I took it upstairs,
but they didn't listen.

27:48.700 --> 27:49.967
Here.

27:49.969 --> 27:51.902
(auto-dial beeping)

27:51.904 --> 27:53.070
Go.

27:53.072 --> 27:54.772
It's bad.

27:54.774 --> 27:56.306
What do you want me to do?

27:56.308 --> 27:57.941
Shut it down.

27:57.943 --> 28:00.244
Let's close his store.

28:00.246 --> 28:02.713
Make him make the next move.

28:04.282 --> 28:06.350
SIFTER: And what are are
we looking at, Doctor?

28:09.287 --> 28:13.290
Richard Scaggs, Victoria
Shala and John Doe Sniper.

28:13.292 --> 28:16.293
All virtually teleported from
the Baltimore M.E.'s Office.

28:16.295 --> 28:20.064
I called you down here to
take a closer look at Vicky.

28:20.066 --> 28:22.166
Remove Scaggs,

28:22.168 --> 28:24.234
sniper...

28:25.170 --> 28:27.071
...isolate torso.

28:30.742 --> 28:32.242
Enhance keloids.

28:33.712 --> 28:35.913
Found unusual scar tissue
under both breasts.

28:35.915 --> 28:37.981
If there was an enhancement
or a reduction,

28:37.983 --> 28:39.983
I'd expect to see a single scar.

28:39.985 --> 28:42.319
Your kidnapper had
at least a dozen procedures.

28:42.321 --> 28:43.821
She was muling drugs.

28:43.823 --> 28:46.023
Probably carrying them
in her silicone implants.

28:46.025 --> 28:47.925
You can see here

28:47.927 --> 28:49.760
where they cut her open

28:49.762 --> 28:52.162
and sewed up her breasts
to transport the drugs.

28:52.164 --> 28:53.897
Both a mule
and a saddlebag.

28:53.899 --> 28:55.733
It's a tough way
to make a living.

28:55.735 --> 28:57.000
No wonder she wanted out.

28:57.002 --> 28:59.002
Explains why
she and Ricky went rogue.

28:59.004 --> 29:01.972
Sold the Harrisburg baby
to Hookstraten.

29:01.974 --> 29:03.474
Cross their boss,
which got them killed.

29:03.476 --> 29:05.075
Sounds like he'll stop
at nothing

29:05.077 --> 29:06.777
to keep his business going.

29:06.779 --> 29:08.445
We are looking
for a target who graduated

29:08.447 --> 29:10.948
from drug trafficker
to child trafficker.

29:10.950 --> 29:12.349
RYAN:
Product is product.

29:12.351 --> 29:14.318
And like drugs,
babies have a value.

29:14.320 --> 29:15.886
As long as they're alive.

29:15.888 --> 29:17.988
SIFTER: You know, it's
an interesting cat and mouse

29:17.990 --> 29:19.289
you and the target
are playing.

29:19.291 --> 29:20.524
His plan is unraveling.

29:20.526 --> 29:22.993
Vicky and Ricky went rogue.

29:22.995 --> 29:24.895
Elijah took out the sniper.

29:24.897 --> 29:28.198
Harrisburg baby is back
with his parents.

29:28.200 --> 29:30.534
That is too many setbacks.

29:30.536 --> 29:33.003
My guess is
he is feeling desperate.

29:33.005 --> 29:36.173
And desperate people do
desperate things.

29:36.175 --> 29:38.408
Take the ammo.
Switch to shotgun.

29:38.410 --> 29:40.344
Hey, Cheeseburger One!

29:40.346 --> 29:42.112
Wait for me, dude!
You need cover!

29:42.114 --> 29:43.781
(electronic whoosh)
What the...?

29:43.783 --> 29:45.315
Seriously?

29:45.317 --> 29:48.051
(electronic buzzing)
Why can't I X-out of this thing?

29:48.053 --> 29:50.821
(electronic buzzing continues)

29:50.823 --> 29:52.022
(sighs) Fine!

29:52.024 --> 29:53.290
(game blips)

29:53.292 --> 29:54.792
(indistinct, distorted
voice over headphones)

29:54.794 --> 29:58.362
VOICE: ...Natal-Cam back online
or Caleb dies!

29:58.364 --> 30:00.430
Mom...!

30:02.967 --> 30:05.469
I think when you shut down
Natal-Cam you got his attention.

30:05.471 --> 30:07.538
(siren wailing in distance)

30:13.111 --> 30:17.548
MAN (on video): Put Natal-Cam
back online or Caleb dies.

30:20.018 --> 30:21.485
KRUMITZ: I mean,
he could've just

30:21.487 --> 30:23.554
called the land line
at the Reynolds' house.

30:23.556 --> 30:25.255
Why send the threat
to a neighbor?

30:25.257 --> 30:26.857
Target wanted maximum impact.

30:26.859 --> 30:29.560
He sends us a video
of Caleb in distress.

30:29.562 --> 30:31.261
Intimidation tactic.

30:31.263 --> 30:33.997
Well, it worked; we're here.

30:33.999 --> 30:36.600
And now we are going
to send him a message back.

30:38.169 --> 30:42.906
This is Special Agent Ryan
of FBI Cyber Division.

30:42.908 --> 30:45.142
Natal-Cam will be back
online in 30 minutes.

30:45.144 --> 30:46.610
Please don't harm that child.

30:46.612 --> 30:47.911
Okay, well,
that's gutsy.

30:47.913 --> 30:50.347
"Hi, target.

30:50.349 --> 30:52.516
Just little ol' me, Avery Ryan."

30:52.518 --> 30:55.018
He knows the FBI's involved.

30:55.020 --> 30:57.888
That video he sent of Caleb
tells me all about him.

30:57.890 --> 31:00.557
He's angry, he's out of control,
he wants his baby business back.

31:00.559 --> 31:03.894
I am just buying us
a small window of time

31:03.896 --> 31:05.429
so we can whack that mole.

31:05.431 --> 31:07.564
So what's our
30-minute game plan?

31:07.566 --> 31:10.601
Game Vex... is a console, right?

31:10.603 --> 31:12.302
Oh...

31:12.304 --> 31:15.505
And most game companies
with live capabilities

31:15.507 --> 31:17.140
have safeguards
against pedophiles.

31:17.142 --> 31:19.376
That's why companies
like Game Vex

31:19.378 --> 31:21.478
assign unique identifiers
to each box.

31:21.480 --> 31:23.347
If any child gets harassed,

31:23.349 --> 31:26.516
they can track the perpetrator
right down to the console.

31:26.518 --> 31:28.652
You track the box,
you find the target.

31:43.668 --> 31:45.602
Our move.

31:53.378 --> 31:54.478
Team in position.

32:02.687 --> 32:04.955
Make it count.

32:06.224 --> 32:08.191
No pressure.

32:32.951 --> 32:34.952
(speaks Albanian)

32:34.954 --> 32:35.652
All right, let's go.

32:35.654 --> 32:37.287
Come on.

32:43.594 --> 32:45.629
FBI!
Police! Freeze!

32:45.631 --> 32:47.965
(agents shouting)
Drop it!

32:47.967 --> 32:49.566
FBI! On the ground!

32:51.202 --> 32:54.438
Drop it!
Get on the ground! Now!

33:01.245 --> 33:02.145
Let's go!

33:03.648 --> 33:06.116
Line up!

33:06.118 --> 33:08.051
MUNDO:
Line 'em up.

33:08.720 --> 33:10.187
AGENT:
On your back!

33:13.057 --> 33:16.026
Find the computers.
Get into 'em.

33:41.152 --> 33:42.252
Where's Caleb Reynolds?

33:42.254 --> 33:44.488
Why you ask me?

33:44.490 --> 33:47.057
Every guy here keeps
sneaking a peek at you.

33:47.059 --> 33:49.359
You're the boss.

33:49.361 --> 33:52.029
What about the other
two babies you kidnapped?

33:52.031 --> 33:54.031
Springfield? Flushing?

33:54.033 --> 33:55.465
Does that ring a bell?

33:58.336 --> 34:01.138
New tat?

34:02.140 --> 34:03.774
Is that a date?

34:03.776 --> 34:06.143
Date my mother croaked.

34:07.745 --> 34:09.679
KRUMITZ:
Avery! You need to see this.

34:14.419 --> 34:16.553
This is their network
we shut down.

34:16.555 --> 34:19.122
From here, they can
case the babies for weeks.

34:19.124 --> 34:21.792
Data's encrypted.
20-character password.

34:21.794 --> 34:24.428
Even with an alphanumeric code,
the possibility

34:24.430 --> 34:27.297
of us identifying
the actual password is 62

34:27.299 --> 34:29.366
to the 20th power.

34:29.368 --> 34:31.334
Running three
gigahertz 24-7,

34:31.336 --> 34:33.370
we could probably break
the encryption in...

34:33.372 --> 34:34.838
ten billion years.

34:34.840 --> 34:36.807
Most people can't
remember a sequence

34:36.809 --> 34:38.842
longer than a phone number.

34:38.844 --> 34:40.377
Chances of these geniuses

34:40.379 --> 34:43.113
memorizing
20 characters is...

34:43.115 --> 34:45.482
impossible.

34:45.484 --> 34:47.751
Which means they
wrote it down somewhere.

34:53.324 --> 34:54.858
Do any of you know Sven?

34:57.128 --> 34:59.496
Elisa?

34:59.498 --> 35:00.831
Vladimir?

35:03.101 --> 35:05.102
Your mother?

35:08.806 --> 35:10.574
KRUMITZ: Time to earn
your stripes, Nelson.

35:12.243 --> 35:13.577
Eenie, meanie, miney, moe.

35:13.579 --> 35:15.412
Catch a "gangsta"
by the toe.

35:15.414 --> 35:16.746
Rearrange the
numbers, yo.

35:16.748 --> 35:19.149
Early years are first to go.

35:19.151 --> 35:21.151
What are you doing?
I think better

35:21.153 --> 35:22.452
when I talk it out in rhyme.

35:22.454 --> 35:24.354
Really?

35:26.757 --> 35:29.126
I got it.
Let's arrange it by year.

35:29.128 --> 35:32.162
Let's go earliest to latest,
starting with 1-23-09

35:32.164 --> 35:33.330
6-17-10,

35:33.332 --> 35:35.165
3-21-11,

35:35.167 --> 35:37.234
(over speaker): ...1-12-13.

35:38.169 --> 35:39.503
(electronic blipping)

35:39.505 --> 35:42.339
Nice work, Baby Face-- we're in.

35:45.776 --> 35:47.811
MUNDO: All right,
three babies, three cars,

35:47.813 --> 35:49.412
all GeoTrack'd--
one outside Flushing,

35:49.414 --> 35:51.414
one just north of Springfield--
those are the most

35:51.416 --> 35:54.584
recent kidnappings.
Odd baby out must be Caleb.

35:54.586 --> 35:55.785
Upstate New York.

35:58.789 --> 36:01.191
WOMAN:<i> How can there be no one</i>
<i> at the warehouse?</i>

36:01.193 --> 36:05.328
All the other airports
are too hot-- let's
try Trenton-Mercer.

36:05.330 --> 36:07.831
I just want my fee for the brat.
(Caleb wailing)

36:07.833 --> 36:09.566

Cops!

36:09.568 --> 36:11.268
Go, go, go!

36:24.215 --> 36:25.282

Look out!

(Caleb fusses)

38:34.446 --> 38:36.446
(sighs):
Oh...

38:36.448 --> 38:39.716
I never thought that
I would... hold him again.

38:39.718 --> 38:43.987
I... I'm never
gonna let him go.

38:43.989 --> 38:47.490
I don't think that
would be fair to Dad.

38:47.492 --> 38:49.326
Now that he's back,

38:49.328 --> 38:51.761
I think there are
a lot of people...

38:51.763 --> 38:53.863
who would love to hold him.

38:53.865 --> 38:56.333
(Caleb burbles happily)

38:56.335 --> 38:59.069
(sniffles)
Thank you.

39:18.522 --> 39:20.457
(laughter)

39:20.459 --> 39:22.392
Good news.

39:22.394 --> 39:24.661
We, uh, swept up

39:24.663 --> 39:26.029
the other two kidnap teams.

39:26.031 --> 39:29.366
The babies are fine;
they are home, safe and sound.

39:29.368 --> 39:31.000
(whooping, happy chatter)

39:31.002 --> 39:33.136
Good, good, good.
SIFTER:
I'm proud of you.

39:33.138 --> 39:34.537
SIFTER:
Hey, it's late.

39:34.539 --> 39:36.773
Time to get you all back home

39:36.775 --> 39:38.608
to your parents' basements.

39:38.610 --> 39:39.909
(laughs)

39:39.911 --> 39:42.612
Krumitz,
you're home already.

39:42.614 --> 39:47.684
All right, we start
all over again tomorrow.

39:47.686 --> 39:48.952
Let's grab a beer.
Yeah.

39:49.820 --> 39:52.889
Later.
See you there.

39:57.695 --> 40:00.029
One thing I never asked.

40:00.031 --> 40:03.066
Why did you go to bat for me?

40:03.068 --> 40:05.468
Oh, there was
a hacker once.

40:05.470 --> 40:08.438
It was the beginning
of the Internet.

40:08.440 --> 40:10.673
I was a behavioral
psychologist.

40:10.675 --> 40:13.410
I had a practice
in New York.

40:13.412 --> 40:15.979
And then one day,
all my patients' files

40:15.981 --> 40:18.114
were stolen from
my computer,

40:18.116 --> 40:21.184
and all their secrets
went public.

40:22.153 --> 40:25.054
I lost my career
and my practice,

40:25.056 --> 40:27.123
but more importantly...

40:27.125 --> 40:29.692
one of my patients
was murdered.

40:29.694 --> 40:32.061
I keep thinking

40:32.063 --> 40:34.431
if I could just turn you,
one hacker at a time,

40:34.433 --> 40:36.733
nothing like that will
ever happen again.

40:36.735 --> 40:38.134
So, did you catch him?

40:38.136 --> 40:40.670
I mean, the hacker?

40:40.672 --> 40:42.639
Is he in jail?

40:42.641 --> 40:45.141
I still don't even
know who he is.

40:45.143 --> 40:46.976
So...

40:46.978 --> 40:49.712
(sighs) I take it you're
definitely going for drinks.

40:49.714 --> 40:51.748
No. After every case,

40:51.750 --> 40:53.850
I go somewhere to think.

40:54.985 --> 40:57.520
Think about what?

40:57.522 --> 40:59.889
How I'm gonna catch him.
