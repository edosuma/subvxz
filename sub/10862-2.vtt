00:35.280 --> 00:36.320
Whoa!

00:36.320 --> 00:37.680
Come on! Come on! 
 Let's go!

00:37.680 --> 00:39.840
- Getting late! 
 - What's the rush?

00:39.840 --> 00:41.680
Fright Night at the Majestic Theater.

00:41.680 --> 00:43.400
Gore-orama. 
 Triple feature marathon.

00:43.400 --> 00:44.800
We got free passes.

00:44.800 --> 00:47.440
Cool. What's playing?

00:47.440 --> 00:49.320
Who cares? 
 Let's go.

00:49.320 --> 00:53.200
I've been to Fright Night, 
 and I'm never going back.

00:53.200 --> 00:55.040
Why not?

00:55.040 --> 00:58.600
Because Frank's afraid 
 of the dark, remember?

00:58.600 --> 01:00.120
I'm not going back

01:00.120 --> 01:04.120
because you sit in that 
 movie theater for so long...

01:04.120 --> 01:08.240
you start to forget that 
 the real world even exists.

01:08.240 --> 01:10.640
The only thing that seems real...

01:10.640 --> 01:13.760
is the horror movie 
 up on the screen.

01:16.480 --> 01:18.840
That's what my story's about.

01:18.840 --> 01:21.800
You know when you get 
 really scared,

01:22.080 --> 01:24.680
you can always tell yourself 
 that it's just a movie...

01:24.680 --> 01:27.800
but sometimes a movie 
 seems so real,

01:27.800 --> 01:30.720
that it's hard 
 to tell the difference

01:30.720 --> 01:32.360
between what's make-believe...

01:32.360 --> 01:34.480
and what's really there.

01:39.840 --> 01:42.680
Submitted for the approval 
 of the Midnight Society,

01:42.680 --> 01:45.400
I call this story...

01:52.360 --> 01:55.240
[woman] 
 I wanted to show you the view.

01:55.240 --> 01:57.360
It's lovely, isn't it?

01:57.360 --> 01:59.040
[man] 
 Lovely.

02:03.760 --> 02:06.000
[one person clapping]

02:21.240 --> 02:23.280
Oh! Enjoy the film, ma'am?

02:23.280 --> 02:25.120
Pfft!

02:28.240 --> 02:29.800
Everybody's a critic.

02:29.800 --> 02:32.120
Let's go. 
 This place is depressing.

02:32.120 --> 02:34.760
I got to clean the Aisles first.

02:40.920 --> 02:42.200
Six bucks? That's it?

02:42.200 --> 02:44.800
One popcorn, two sodas.

02:44.800 --> 02:46.680
Pete bought the second soda.

02:46.680 --> 02:49.640
Friday is supposed 
 to be a good night.

02:49.640 --> 02:52.960
Six bucks is a good night.

02:52.960 --> 02:54.320
Well, this job's getting tough.

02:54.320 --> 02:56.400
Had to pick up two 
 of these things tonight.

02:56.400 --> 02:57.720
Make jokes.

02:57.720 --> 03:00.200
You going to laugh when 
 they shut this place down?

03:00.200 --> 03:01.720
No. 
 They'll never close the Rialto

03:01.720 --> 03:04.000
- It's a landmark. 
 - Tell that to the owners.

03:04.000 --> 03:05.240
They don't like losing money.

03:05.240 --> 03:06.920
Is everything busted around here?

03:13.760 --> 03:16.120
This place would fall 
 apart without you.

03:16.120 --> 03:17.800
Well, it's falling apart anyway.

03:17.800 --> 03:19.760
Hey, we can re-use these.

03:21.600 --> 03:24.640
Hey, do you really think 
 they're going to shut us down?

03:24.640 --> 03:26.200
I don't know,

03:26.200 --> 03:28.680
but I'm applying for 
 a job over at the quad.

03:28.680 --> 03:30.240
The quad? 
 That's a multiplex.

03:30.240 --> 03:31.720
And it's got lines around the block.

03:31.720 --> 03:34.720
- I need the job. 
 - Hey, uh...

03:34.720 --> 03:37.080
you want to get something to eat?

03:37.080 --> 03:38.920
Oh... no. 
 I got homework.

03:38.920 --> 03:40.560
Thanks anyway.

03:46.200 --> 03:49.120
[Frank] Pete couldn't stand 
 to see the Rialto die,

03:49.120 --> 03:52.480
so he started a campaign 
 to keep it open.

03:54.080 --> 03:57.560
It wasn't just his job 
 he was worried about.

03:57.560 --> 04:00.280
Pete loved movies 
 and loved the old theater.

04:00.280 --> 04:02.880
But it was no use.

04:02.880 --> 04:07.880
Unless a miracle happened, 
 the Rialto was doomed.

04:10.680 --> 04:12.480
No! Wait! Wait!

04:12.480 --> 04:14.320
- Sorry. 
 - Thanks.

04:14.320 --> 04:15.880
I guess I almost locked you out.

04:15.880 --> 04:17.600
You know, um, don't bother.

04:17.600 --> 04:19.399
No one comes in when we're open.

04:28.360 --> 04:30.640
So how's the campaign going, 
 Don Quixote?

04:30.640 --> 04:33.600
Well, you know, 
 I went to the zoning commission

04:33.600 --> 04:35.440
to try to get landmark status.

04:35.440 --> 04:37.080
It's not going to be easy.

04:42.240 --> 04:44.240
I hate to break this to you, Pete,

04:44.240 --> 04:45.960
but I think you're just dreaming.

04:45.960 --> 04:49.480
- Why don't you just-- 
 - [banging]

04:50.640 --> 04:53.040
We're not open for an hour!

04:53.040 --> 04:55.200
[banging]

04:58.760 --> 05:01.280
[banging]

05:01.520 --> 05:04.320
Yo! Come back in an hour!

05:19.160 --> 05:20.560
Who are you?

05:20.560 --> 05:23.960
Vink's the name. 
 Dr. Vink.

05:23.960 --> 05:27.480
- Dr. Vink? 
 - Vink with a V-V-V.

05:28.480 --> 05:32.120
Perfect! 
 Absolutely perfect!

05:32.120 --> 05:33.880
We're not open yet.

05:33.880 --> 05:35.720
- That smell... 
 - [sniff]

05:35.720 --> 05:37.400
It's wonderful!

05:37.400 --> 05:39.960
No modern theater 
 has that smell.

05:39.960 --> 05:43.400
- It's stale popcorn. 
 - Look, what do you want?

05:43.400 --> 05:45.960
It's not what I want, lad.

05:45.960 --> 05:47.640
It's what you want.

05:47.640 --> 05:52.040
- Is this your handiwork? 
 - Yeah.

05:52.040 --> 05:53.880
Then I've come to the right place.

05:53.880 --> 05:54.600
Ha ha!

05:56.280 --> 05:59.800
The guy is a nut bag. 
 I'm calling the police.

05:59.800 --> 06:01.800
No. No. Wait.

06:03.240 --> 06:06.120
Marvelous! Marvelous!

06:06.120 --> 06:09.000
I couldn't have designed it 
 better myself!

06:09.000 --> 06:12.240
Uh, look, you're not 
 supposed to be here, OK?

06:12.240 --> 06:14.640
What is this? Who are you?

06:14.640 --> 06:18.240
Vink's the name. Dr. Vink.

06:18.240 --> 06:20.360
With a V-V-V.

06:20.360 --> 06:22.240
Whatever you're selling, 
 I'm not buying.

06:22.240 --> 06:27.160
My good man, I've come 
 to save your theater...

06:28.280 --> 06:32.160
and it won't cost you a dime.

06:33.640 --> 06:37.120
And I am not a nut bag.

06:39.240 --> 06:43.240
I am a filmmaker, 
 at least I used to be,

06:43.240 --> 06:46.080
back when theaters like this 
 were commonplace,

06:46.080 --> 06:50.080
back before wide screens, 
 before color,

06:50.080 --> 06:52.280
before sound,

06:52.280 --> 06:57.880
back when films tried 
 to stir the imagination,

06:57.880 --> 06:59.560
not bludgeon it.

06:59.560 --> 07:01.800
How old are you?

07:01.800 --> 07:04.680
Old enough to know 
 that things have changed.

07:04.680 --> 07:09.040
- Look, pal-- 
 - my films were quite popular, you know.

07:09.040 --> 07:11.120
They always had a certain...

07:12.400 --> 07:15.360
- magic. 
 - How did you do that?

07:15.360 --> 07:18.520
A film I made many years ago--

07:18.520 --> 07:20.840
a horror film.

07:20.840 --> 07:25.040
- Really? 
 - A vampire film, to be precise.

07:25.040 --> 07:28.640
It's quite unique, 
 for in my story,

07:28.640 --> 07:31.920
the vampire wins. 
 Ha ha ha!

07:31.920 --> 07:34.200
What's your angle, pal?

07:34.200 --> 07:38.120
My good man, 
 I'll make you a promise.

07:38.120 --> 07:40.600
Show my film in your theater,

07:40.600 --> 07:43.520
and people will flock to see it.

07:43.520 --> 07:45.040
Your fortunes will turn,

07:45.040 --> 07:49.640
and you will make for 
 more than six bucks a night.

07:49.640 --> 07:55.200
A black-and-white silent film 
 is going to turn this place around?

07:55.200 --> 07:58.800
That ain't a vampire movie. 
 That's a fairy tale.

07:58.800 --> 08:01.080
You don't have to believe me.

08:01.080 --> 08:05.120
Just show my film once, 
 and you'll see.

08:05.120 --> 08:08.360
- As for payment-- 
 - Ah! Here we go!

08:08.360 --> 08:11.560
I don't want money.

08:11.560 --> 08:16.040
All I ask is that once 
 your success is assured,

08:16.040 --> 08:20.120
you give me one night 
 a week of your choosing

08:20.120 --> 08:22.600
to show my other films 
 to the public.

08:22.600 --> 08:25.080
If this film can do as you say,

08:25.080 --> 08:28.040
I'll give you three nights 
 plus a cut of the vending.

08:28.040 --> 08:30.120
I don't want your popcorn money.

08:31.440 --> 08:34.120
Just one night a week.

08:35.280 --> 08:37.880
Do we have a deal?

08:40.400 --> 08:42.240
Wonderful!

08:42.240 --> 08:46.040
- You're a wise man. 
 - Look out!

08:46.040 --> 08:48.720
Look, buddy, 
 maybe you'd better...

08:50.000 --> 08:51.720
Where'd he go?

08:51.720 --> 08:55.120
Back to Mars, 
 where he came from.

08:55.120 --> 08:57.720
So do we show it?

08:57.720 --> 09:01.240
The guy's loony. 
 Throw it out.

09:05.160 --> 09:08.120
[Frank] Pete stuck the movie 
 in the projection booth

09:08.120 --> 09:09.560
and forgot all about it,

09:09.560 --> 09:12.560
but he didn't forget his mission 
 to save the Rialto,

09:12.800 --> 09:14.600
though it was looking pretty bad.

09:14.600 --> 09:18.720
Bills were piling up, 
 and tickets sale were going down.

09:21.600 --> 09:23.160
It was only a matter of time

09:23.160 --> 09:25.240
before the owners 
 would pull the plug

09:25.240 --> 09:26.960
and shut the old theater 
 down forever.

09:26.960 --> 09:31.560
Then, one Saturday night, 
 things took an interesting turn.

09:37.520 --> 09:40.000
You wanted to see us?

09:40.000 --> 09:43.440
Yeah. 
 [sighs deeply]

09:45.480 --> 09:48.440
Something tells me 
 this is bad news.

09:49.680 --> 09:52.960
- So? 
 - I just got the word.

09:52.960 --> 09:55.600
We close in two weeks.

10:06.720 --> 10:09.320
No way! They can't 
 close down a landmark!

10:09.320 --> 10:11.240
I think maybe they can.

10:20.000 --> 10:22.760
Oh, now what? 
 Come on.

10:29.160 --> 10:32.040
- What happened? 
 - I don't know.

10:32.040 --> 10:33.920
I'll go handle the refunds.

10:33.920 --> 10:36.280
No! Wait! Wait!

10:37.200 --> 10:39.080
I got an idea.

10:39.080 --> 10:41.960
Can I have your attention?

10:41.960 --> 10:44.200
We've... ahem.

10:44.200 --> 10:46.920
We've had technical difficulties 
 with tonight's film

10:46.920 --> 10:49.880
and won't be able to continue 
 with the showing.

10:49.880 --> 10:51.960
[audience groaning and mumbling]

10:51.960 --> 10:54.400
But we've got a special surprise.

10:54.400 --> 10:56.600
We're going to be showing 
 a classic film

10:56.600 --> 10:58.840
from the golden age 
 of silent movies instead.

10:58.840 --> 11:00.280
[audience groaning]

11:00.280 --> 11:05.440
And if you stay for the showing 
 and aren't completely satisfied,

11:05.440 --> 11:07.960
you'll still get a full refund 
 when you leave.

11:07.960 --> 11:10.400
This better be good, young lady.

11:10.400 --> 11:13.040
My time is valuable.

11:13.040 --> 11:15.720
Enjoy the show.

11:34.080 --> 11:37.440
- That was chilling. 
 - I was so scared...

11:37.440 --> 11:40.960
So good I'll probably have 
 nightmares for a week.

11:40.960 --> 11:42.960
Show more classics 
 like that, kid,

11:42.960 --> 11:45.560
and you might get 
 a couple more customers.

11:47.000 --> 11:48.520
See you tomorrow.

11:48.520 --> 11:51.600
Good night. 
 Tell your friends.

11:52.560 --> 11:55.920
They loved it. 
 No one wanted a refund.

11:55.920 --> 11:56.920
Yes!

11:59.040 --> 12:01.480
- We got a hit! 
 - Yeah!

12:01.480 --> 12:03.080
Let's hug again!

12:03.080 --> 12:06.480
- Um, Pete... 
 - Oh, sorry. I didn't mean to...

12:06.480 --> 12:10.600
Oh, no. Isn't this exactly 
 what that Dr. Vink guy

12:10.600 --> 12:14.040
- said would happen? 
 - Yeah, I guess it is.

12:14.040 --> 12:14.760
Weird.

12:16.440 --> 12:18.920
Let's tell Kristoph. 
 Come on.

12:34.560 --> 12:37.040
Dr. Vink's movie was a smash,

12:37.040 --> 12:40.160
so they started a Saturday night 
 midnight madness show,

12:40.160 --> 12:42.200
and it became a huge cult hit.

12:42.200 --> 12:46.240
They got so busy, 
 the owners decided not to sell.

12:46.240 --> 12:48.040
Just as Dr. Vink predicted.

12:48.040 --> 12:51.040
Just as Dr. Vink predicted.

13:21.120 --> 13:24.120
[cheering and applause]

13:30.280 --> 13:32.480
Good night. 
 Thanks for coming.

13:32.480 --> 13:34.360
Come again. Good night.

13:34.360 --> 13:38.040
Major popcorn sales. 
 The place is a mess.

13:38.040 --> 13:39.360
Yes!

13:39.360 --> 13:42.560
Uh, hey, you know, I was 
 wondering maybe after, you know,

13:42.560 --> 13:46.680
we clean up and everything, 
 uh, you know, you and I could--

13:48.320 --> 13:51.560
- Evening, lad. 
 - Dr. Vink!

13:51.560 --> 13:55.680
I thought I'd stop by and see 
 how things were progressing.

13:55.680 --> 13:58.080
Well, your film's a smash. 
 It's unbelievable!

13:58.080 --> 14:01.040
I mean, people are packing in 
 and staying for two shows

14:01.040 --> 14:04.440
- and bringing friends. 
 - There you are!

14:04.440 --> 14:05.520
Ha ha ha!

14:07.360 --> 14:09.880
I want to shake 
 the hand of the man

14:09.880 --> 14:12.800
who saved this theater. 
 Where you been?

14:12.800 --> 14:15.160
I thought it best to stay away

14:15.160 --> 14:17.000
until the success of 
 your theater was assured.

14:17.000 --> 14:18.480
Success? Ha! 
 We're killing them.

14:18.480 --> 14:22.440
And don't think I forget 
 who we can thank for that.

14:22.440 --> 14:24.800
It's time we made a deal

14:24.800 --> 14:27.040
for that, uh, 
 masterpiece of yours.

14:27.040 --> 14:29.720
I believe we already have a deal.

14:29.720 --> 14:32.080
You promised me 
 one night a week

14:32.080 --> 14:34.440
to show my other films, 
 did you not?

14:34.440 --> 14:37.600
- You were serious about that? 
 - Quite.

14:37.600 --> 14:41.280
Look, Doc, I can't show 
 old movies here during the week.

14:41.280 --> 14:43.280
Saturday night, midnight, maybe,

14:43.280 --> 14:45.640
but I'm getting A-list films 
 in here now.

14:45.640 --> 14:47.520
Why don't I just 
 write you a check--

14:47.520 --> 14:49.280
I don't want your money.

14:49.280 --> 14:51.240
I don't want your friendship.

14:51.240 --> 14:53.960
I want your theater.

14:53.960 --> 14:56.360
One shouldn't make a bargain

14:56.360 --> 15:00.240
if they can't honor their commitments.

15:00.240 --> 15:02.800
- Maybe we-- 
 - Look, pal, it's not going to happen.

15:02.800 --> 15:05.400
You want a rental fee 
 for your movie? Fine.

15:05.400 --> 15:07.880
But you are not 
 getting this theater.

15:07.880 --> 15:09.840
End of story.

15:11.880 --> 15:12.960
Ha ha ha!

15:16.040 --> 15:19.160
That's where you're wrong, 
 my friend.

15:21.800 --> 15:25.440
This story is far, far from over!

15:25.440 --> 15:27.480
Ha ha ha!

15:27.480 --> 15:30.280
In fact, it's only just beginning.

15:30.280 --> 15:31.360
Ha ha ha!

15:38.760 --> 15:41.800
Hey, he doesn't want 
 to get paid for his film,

15:41.800 --> 15:43.720
that's his problem.

15:52.080 --> 15:54.920
[Frank] 
 The Rialto to continued to do well,

15:54.920 --> 15:56.920
all because of Dr. Vink's 
 strange movie.

15:56.920 --> 16:01.040
Pete wanted to study it to 
 figure out why it was so magical.

16:01.040 --> 16:05.120
Unfortunately, 
 he was about to find out.

16:23.200 --> 16:26.440
You know what? 
 I just had the weird dream.

16:26.440 --> 16:27.720
What?

16:27.720 --> 16:31.320
I thought I saw Nosferatu 
 step out of the movie.

16:31.320 --> 16:33.560
I think you've been 
 working here too long.

16:41.160 --> 16:43.240
Uh... Katie...

16:43.240 --> 16:46.600
I know you think I'm kind of a geek.

16:46.600 --> 16:48.720
You're not a geek, Pete.

16:48.720 --> 16:50.920
You're a nerd.

16:50.920 --> 16:53.160
I'm kidding.

17:06.040 --> 17:09.760
Well, uh... 
 you know, I guess you know

17:09.760 --> 17:11.880
that I kind of...

17:11.880 --> 17:15.400
- like you and stuff. 
 - It's OK, Pete.

17:15.400 --> 17:18.400
I... kind of like you, too.

17:23.359 --> 17:25.319
[man screams]

17:29.200 --> 17:31.840
- [knock knock] 
 - Mr. Kristoph?

17:31.840 --> 17:34.120
Mr. Kristoph?

17:37.040 --> 17:39.880
- Are you OK? 
 - What's wrong with him?

17:39.880 --> 17:42.520
I don't know. He...

17:43.360 --> 17:46.440
- Ugh! Gross! 
 - I'll get an ambulance.

17:48.800 --> 17:50.880
It's-- it's dead.

17:50.880 --> 17:53.080
No way.

17:54.240 --> 17:57.200
- We got to get help. 
 - I'll stay with him.

17:57.200 --> 17:59.120
No. We're staying together. 
 Come on.

18:10.320 --> 18:12.000
No. No.

18:12.000 --> 18:15.360
- Pete, what is going on? 
 - It's Dr. Vink. It's got to be.

18:15.360 --> 18:18.320
- He's trying to scare us. 
 - Well, he's doing a good job.

18:18.320 --> 18:19.800
[banging]

18:19.800 --> 18:22.000
We know it's you, Dr. Vink.

18:25.640 --> 18:26.640
Aah!

18:35.880 --> 18:37.440
Was that the vampire?

18:37.440 --> 18:39.760
No! Yes! Maybe. 
 I don't know.

18:39.760 --> 18:42.840
Maybe I did see him 
 come out of the movie.

18:42.840 --> 18:44.160
Movies aren't real.

18:44.160 --> 18:45.480
Well, that guy looked 
 pretty real to me.

18:45.480 --> 18:47.280
[banging]

18:51.240 --> 18:52.680
Come on!

19:08.600 --> 19:10.920
- What are we going to do? 
 - OK. Maybe I'm crazy,

19:10.920 --> 19:13.640
but I think I saw that vampire 
 come out of the film.

19:13.640 --> 19:16.080
- How? 
 - I don't know.

19:16.080 --> 19:17.880
There's something weird 
 about that movie,

19:17.880 --> 19:20.280
and Dr. Vink's using it 
 to get revenge.

19:20.280 --> 19:23.360
- This can't be real. 
 - OK. I got an idea.

19:23.360 --> 19:25.200
Thread up the last reel 
 on the projector.

19:25.200 --> 19:27.320
Why 
 What are you going to do?

19:27.320 --> 19:30.080
Probably something stupid, 
 but I got to try.

19:30.080 --> 19:31.800
Yell when it's ready.

19:38.320 --> 19:39.880
Who are you?

19:39.880 --> 19:41.680
How did you get here?

19:41.680 --> 19:42.400
Ready!

19:58.400 --> 19:59.920
Aah!

20:49.920 --> 20:51.760
Pete!

20:51.760 --> 20:54.560
Hurry! He's coming!

21:01.120 --> 21:04.640
Sorry, pal. 
 Got to finish what you started.

21:16.360 --> 21:18.120
Pete, I'm going to stop the film.

21:18.120 --> 21:20.040
No. 
 I'll be trapped in here!

21:21.680 --> 21:24.960
I saw this film, 
 and I know how it ends...

21:26.040 --> 21:28.840
and I'm doing it right.

21:28.840 --> 21:31.160
Aah! Aah!

21:58.440 --> 22:00.280
Pete!

22:03.280 --> 22:04.840
What happened?

22:05.960 --> 22:09.160
- Are you OK? 
 - Yeah. What a dream.

22:09.160 --> 22:11.760
This movie's starting to get to me.

22:11.760 --> 22:14.240
You have no idea.

22:14.240 --> 22:15.040
Ha ha ha! Bravo!

22:18.720 --> 22:22.720
- Vink. 
 - Good show, lad.

22:22.720 --> 22:26.520
I couldn't have written it 
 better myself.

22:26.520 --> 22:28.240
As for you, Kristoph--

22:28.240 --> 22:31.560
Look, Dr. Vink, 
 I've been thinking.

22:31.560 --> 22:34.640
A deal is a deal. 
 Forget what I said before.

22:34.640 --> 22:37.000
You can have your one night a week.

22:37.000 --> 22:41.240
That won't be necessary. 
 You see...

22:41.240 --> 22:43.840
I've just purchased this theater.

22:43.840 --> 22:46.160
- You what? 
 - Oh, yes.

22:46.160 --> 22:53.560
Now I can show my films 
 every night, and believe me,

22:53.560 --> 22:57.200
I've got many, many more

22:57.200 --> 23:00.120
that are far better than this one.

23:00.120 --> 23:01.200
Ha ha ha!

23:06.200 --> 23:08.040
The End.

23:09.160 --> 23:10.840
So who's going to fright night?

23:10.840 --> 23:15.640
- Uh, it's getting late. 
 - Yeah. I'm kind of tired.

23:17.200 --> 23:21.480
- See you later, Frank. 
 - Yeah, see you.

23:21.480 --> 23:24.320
Here. 
 You can have my tickets.

23:25.680 --> 23:29.120
I, uh, thought you weren't 
 going to fright night.

23:29.120 --> 23:31.200
You kidding? 
 It's just a movie,

23:31.200 --> 23:33.080
and I got two free passes.

23:33.080 --> 23:35.760
- Let's go. 
 - Come on.
