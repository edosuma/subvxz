00:02.789 --> 00:05.358
- I know when I've had enough.
- So do I.

00:06.289 --> 00:08.672
The bomb went off
when she opened the door.

00:08.758 --> 00:11.154
The victim is indeed
Olivia Walsh.

00:11.239 --> 00:13.194
This morning,
when I saw that blast scene,

00:13.279 --> 00:15.174
it all came back
like it was yesterday.

00:15.259 --> 00:16.273
Orla.

00:16.359 --> 00:18.184
If I'm to go opening up
doors again,

00:18.269 --> 00:20.359
I need a better reason
than a favour to an old mate.

00:20.492 --> 00:23.154
I've driven Mr Lawson to a number
of meetings recently.

00:23.239 --> 00:25.204
If the killings start,
there's nothing you can do about it.

00:25.289 --> 00:27.229
Just leave it alone.

00:28.739 --> 00:31.398
- We have to do this together.
- Do what?

00:31.492 --> 00:34.204
She's met your mother.
Now, she deserves justice.

00:34.289 --> 00:35.969
- Mr Alex Harris?
- Hi.

00:36.055 --> 00:37.539
Do you know this woman?

00:37.625 --> 00:39.948
Olivia initiated
the affair,

00:40.034 --> 00:41.875
but she didn't seem
to enjoy it very much.

00:41.961 --> 00:44.866
Pat Walsh sprays the blood
all over his walls.

00:44.961 --> 00:46.492
Staged his own death.

00:46.578 --> 00:48.039
Niall Malloy.

00:48.125 --> 00:52.515
Joined the IRA in '76. Earned him
his nickname, Death Maker.

00:52.601 --> 00:54.750
- Does he know who did this to Mum?
- Maybe.

00:55.002 --> 00:56.164
I didn't talk.

00:56.766 --> 00:58.799
Niall, I'm begging you!

01:00.069 --> 01:01.219
Please.

02:16.401 --> 02:19.214
Some minor petechial haemorrhaging
on the eyelids.

02:30.990 --> 02:34.998
Little finger, ring finger,
and middle finger are bandaged.

02:39.996 --> 02:44.404
Bruising at the wrist, caused by
severe pulling at the bindings.

02:44.526 --> 02:45.888
No sign of forced entry.

02:56.419 --> 02:59.584
"The fast reflexes of pensioner
William McDonagh saved the life"

02:59.670 --> 03:02.802
"of Luke Ashley, 11, when he fell
into a canal while fishing."

03:02.888 --> 03:05.482
No hero's death
for William McDonagh.

03:08.869 --> 03:10.229
Look at this.

03:14.523 --> 03:15.609
Hmm.

03:18.472 --> 03:20.566
A black hair.

03:23.279 --> 03:25.128
I don't think it's human.

03:38.767 --> 03:39.971
Whiskey.

03:59.667 --> 04:00.979
Here we go.

04:03.269 --> 04:05.861
"Canine inoculation record."

04:06.279 --> 04:10.588
"Owner, Will McDonagh.
Dog's name, Rocky."

04:11.259 --> 04:13.596
He's a Staffordshire bull terrier.

04:14.269 --> 04:16.767
Staffies can be aggressive
if they're trained to be.

04:17.091 --> 04:20.666
- If his owner was being attacked...
- So where's Rocky?

04:29.069 --> 04:30.475
Morning.

04:33.651 --> 04:38.026
How's everyone holding up?
Nightmares all night.

04:38.486 --> 04:40.358
And you?

04:41.094 --> 04:43.811
- You don't have a fag, do you?
- Sorry.

04:44.428 --> 04:47.045
I quit when I got pregnant
with Rebecca, I just...

04:47.514 --> 04:50.204
thought now was a good time
to start again.

04:52.756 --> 04:56.219
- No word from Les?
- No.

04:57.206 --> 05:00.311
Les and his dad,
are they close?

05:01.427 --> 05:04.967
Let me put it this way. In the ten
years that I've known Les,

05:05.053 --> 05:07.819
I've never heard either one of them
raise their voice to each other,

05:07.919 --> 05:10.756
which is more than I can say
for Les and those two.

05:11.633 --> 05:16.295
- So Les would be loyal to his father?
- What are you getting at?

05:16.663 --> 05:20.631
If they're close, Les might be
persuaded to do something

05:20.717 --> 05:23.069
that... normally he wouldn't.

05:24.906 --> 05:26.905
Do what, exactly?

05:27.514 --> 05:31.444
Marie, Pat may not be the person
you think he is.

05:31.569 --> 05:33.224
What are you saying?

05:33.849 --> 05:35.799
He's some sort of criminal?

05:36.879 --> 05:40.280
Les would never do anything illegal.

05:41.299 --> 05:44.030
Les may suspect that your phone
is being monitored.

05:44.116 --> 05:46.709
He might try and get in touch
some other way.

05:46.975 --> 05:49.764
If he does,
you need to let us know.

05:53.490 --> 05:56.288
We're going. Come on, baby.

05:56.600 --> 05:58.481
Becca, come on.

05:58.567 --> 05:59.803
Good girl.

06:15.805 --> 06:17.366
Come on, I won't hurt you.

06:17.452 --> 06:19.194
Come on. Here, Rocky.

06:19.288 --> 06:20.616
Come on.

06:20.702 --> 06:21.949
Rocky.

06:26.366 --> 06:29.749
Hi, Thomas.
We're going to need a vet.

06:30.388 --> 06:32.139
If this dog attacked the assailant,

06:32.225 --> 06:34.702
we might find hair
or blood residue on it.

06:34.966 --> 06:38.327
- You've got a few minutes now. Thanks.
- Thank you.

06:43.444 --> 06:46.600
When was the last time
you had a bath, Rocky?

06:50.354 --> 06:53.350
Nothing obvious round the claws.

06:56.497 --> 06:58.186
Look at this.

07:01.279 --> 07:03.288
Yeah.
Swab, please.

07:20.702 --> 07:22.229
Jack.

07:27.269 --> 07:31.850
The deceased is male, identified
from records as William McDonagh,

07:31.936 --> 07:33.702
aged 65.

07:46.232 --> 07:47.975
Three teeth missing.

07:49.279 --> 07:51.717
22 and 23...

07:52.499 --> 07:54.522
and 45.

07:54.970 --> 07:57.139
Not recent, sockets well healed.

07:59.570 --> 08:03.038
Circular scar tissue to the abdomen.

08:07.663 --> 08:10.374
8mm in diameter.

08:11.977 --> 08:14.944
Yep, similar sized scar tissue
on the other side.

08:15.744 --> 08:17.592
That's a fully healed bullet wound.

08:25.279 --> 08:28.514
Bruising to the right hand
has started to yellow.

08:29.953 --> 08:32.475
Fracture sites haven't united yet.

08:32.721 --> 08:37.280
Not much time for callus formation,
so likely to be fairly recent.

08:38.561 --> 08:39.753
So what have we got?

08:39.839 --> 08:42.663
Multiple signs of trauma,
historic and recent.

08:43.280 --> 08:46.614
Been through the wars,
William McDonagh.

08:49.422 --> 08:51.035
Thank you.

08:53.352 --> 08:56.176
It WAS human blood in the dog's fur.

08:56.285 --> 08:59.996
DNA confirms it belongs to one
Patrick Walsh, otherwise known as...

09:00.114 --> 09:01.801
Niall Malloy.

09:05.259 --> 09:06.801
Oh, God, it hurts.

09:16.893 --> 09:18.356
Did Mum know?

09:18.598 --> 09:20.219
About the cancer?

09:21.781 --> 09:25.489
Well, I didn't tell her right away,
but, yes, she did.

09:26.063 --> 09:27.958
Why were you keeping it from me?

09:28.044 --> 09:29.731
Do you not trust me?

09:29.925 --> 09:31.890
You've got your own kids.

09:32.442 --> 09:34.574
What would you do if you had
a diagnosis like mine?

09:34.660 --> 09:37.035
It's completely different, Dad.
They're young children.

09:39.445 --> 09:41.395
And you'll find out, Les...

09:42.705 --> 09:44.996
you never stop seeing
your children as children.

09:48.269 --> 09:50.356
I just wanted to protect you, son.

09:50.785 --> 09:52.715
Wanted to protect your mum.

09:54.360 --> 09:56.504
OK, we'd better get out of here.

09:57.668 --> 09:58.926
Marie keeps texting me.

09:59.012 --> 10:02.051
She's leaving messages.
She's just worried sick.

10:03.520 --> 10:07.043
We're nearly there. We're close.

10:08.224 --> 10:09.699
I don't want to let you down, Dad.

10:09.785 --> 10:13.715
You're NOT letting me down.
You've done more than enough.

10:20.279 --> 10:22.684
You know, the life I had...

10:23.019 --> 10:26.621
was a good life.
Better than I ever deserved.

10:27.387 --> 10:29.465
It was all down to your mum.

10:29.854 --> 10:33.504
The least I can do for her now
is to bring her justice.

10:34.279 --> 10:36.910
The police WILL find out
who killed her.

10:38.069 --> 10:39.442
Perhaps.

10:39.995 --> 10:41.945
But I may not live to see it.

10:42.739 --> 10:45.957
All I want is to find the people
who did this.

10:46.095 --> 10:48.364
The police can handle the rest.
Dad...

10:54.530 --> 10:57.706
Will McDonagh was involved in a
number of bombings in the '80s,

10:57.792 --> 11:00.638
along with his cousin, Niall Malloy.

11:00.826 --> 11:04.990
Indeed, McDonagh was considered the
closest associate of Malloy.

11:05.156 --> 11:09.552
But back in 1989, he was arrested
for his involvement in the ambush

11:09.638 --> 11:12.599
and murder of two off-duty
RUC officers.

11:12.881 --> 11:14.498
Spend the next ten years in jail,

11:14.584 --> 11:16.764
and then promptly dropped
off the radar.

11:16.901 --> 11:18.873
They've found Les Walsh's car.

11:28.877 --> 11:32.588
Parking lot CCTV picked up Pat and
Les Walsh leaving in a hurry

11:32.674 --> 11:33.979
two hours ago.

11:34.118 --> 11:36.158
Pat looked like he had an injury
to the right hand.

11:42.289 --> 11:45.924
Blood stains.
Remains of a bandage.

11:46.010 --> 11:47.307
A dog bite?

11:49.945 --> 11:51.182
Could be.

11:58.716 --> 12:01.166
Similar to the cup
in McDonagh's flat.

12:01.346 --> 12:04.154
Taken to remove any trace of DNA
from the scene of the crime.

12:04.239 --> 12:05.377
Yeah.

12:07.203 --> 12:10.549
How long has it been since Les Walsh
was last seen?

12:10.791 --> 12:12.183
About 15 hours.

12:12.269 --> 12:15.385
They've got to eat and sleep.
I don't see any signs of food wrappers

12:15.471 --> 12:18.323
or water bottles,
even crumbs or food stains.

12:18.588 --> 12:20.377
Malloy's storage unit
is under surveillance,

12:20.463 --> 12:22.706
so they haven't gone back there.

12:23.518 --> 12:26.154
A careful man like Malloy
might well have two boltholes.

12:26.239 --> 12:28.279
PHONE RINGS

12:29.289 --> 12:30.289
Hey.

12:30.424 --> 12:32.338
Hey. Can we meet?

12:32.573 --> 12:34.154
Now's not good.

12:34.301 --> 12:36.321
- I'm being followed.
- Are you sure?

12:38.279 --> 12:39.933
Yes, I'm sure.

12:40.841 --> 12:43.464
Right, Battersea Park in an hour.
Bye.

13:00.817 --> 13:02.167
You all right?
Mm-hm.

13:02.456 --> 13:04.229
Any idea who he is?

13:05.015 --> 13:06.015
Nope.

13:06.598 --> 13:08.538
Well, let's find out, shall we?

13:14.765 --> 13:16.098
I'll take it from here.

13:18.289 --> 13:20.934
DI Quint. You must be Miss Flanagan.

13:21.020 --> 13:23.194
You had her followed?
I understood from Hodgson here

13:23.279 --> 13:25.600
that you might have established
contact with your source.

13:25.741 --> 13:27.570
- Thanks for that, Jack.
- I assumed that you,

13:27.656 --> 13:30.360
being an investigative reporter,
wouldn't be too keen on sharing.

13:30.462 --> 13:32.076
You assumed correctly.

13:32.325 --> 13:33.524
I'll leave you boys to it.

13:33.610 --> 13:35.196
Look, Miss Flanagan...

13:36.336 --> 13:38.868
Craig Greenwood is a driver
for Ken Lawson,

13:39.165 --> 13:41.197
a prominent Northern Irish
businessman who has been a

13:41.282 --> 13:45.134
vocal proponent of direct rule and a
staunch opponent of power-sharing.

13:45.447 --> 13:47.892
Am I correct in assuming that you
think Lawson might have been

13:48.085 --> 13:51.392
a part of their secret group,
The Guild?

13:52.588 --> 13:54.214
You can think what you like.

13:54.330 --> 13:57.174
Quite a history, Craig Greenwood.

13:57.695 --> 13:59.610
Former loyalist paramilitary.

13:59.713 --> 14:04.180
Suspected of killing at least
12 Republicans, none proven.

14:04.453 --> 14:05.623
Do you trust him?

14:06.610 --> 14:08.803
He hasn't lied to me so far.

14:09.373 --> 14:10.984
And did Greenwood give you
reason to believe

14:11.069 --> 14:13.019
that The Guild was active again?

14:15.580 --> 14:17.045
Any names?

14:18.405 --> 14:20.269
I'll be in touch again,
Miss Flanagan.

14:22.289 --> 14:25.093
Quint, The Guild really exists,
and you confront Lawson

14:25.179 --> 14:26.813
about any of this,
they'll think someone's talked,

14:26.898 --> 14:28.703
they'll start looking for a leak.
I'm aware of that.

14:28.788 --> 14:31.288
You talk to Greenwood, you'll make
him the number one suspect,

14:31.374 --> 14:33.007
he might point the finger at Orla.

14:33.674 --> 14:36.069
If needs be,
Miss Flanagan will get protection.

14:36.841 --> 14:39.390
She'll be safe.
Will she?

14:41.686 --> 14:43.468
You should have told me
you talked to the police.

14:43.553 --> 14:44.843
Orla...

14:56.538 --> 14:57.671
Jack, got a minute?

14:57.757 --> 14:58.757
What is it?

14:59.172 --> 15:02.560
Going through Olivia Walsh's
computer, I saw an e-mail

15:02.693 --> 15:05.864
thanking her for her donation
to a group called For The Living.

15:05.957 --> 15:09.458
- Which is?
- A support group run by surviving families

15:09.544 --> 15:12.036
from both sides of
the Northern Ireland Troubles.

15:12.333 --> 15:14.224
How much did she donate?

15:14.543 --> 15:16.449
Well, according to her bank records,

15:16.544 --> 15:20.164
two £10,000 online donations
two weeks ago.

15:24.617 --> 15:26.688
Are there any earlier donations?

15:28.269 --> 15:29.781
Nope, just these two.

15:32.845 --> 15:37.906
According to Pat Walsh's GP,
he received his cancer diagnosis...

15:38.892 --> 15:41.953
three days before
Olivia's donation.

15:42.899 --> 15:45.524
Do you think it prompted
a confession to his wife?

15:46.036 --> 15:48.555
"Hello, honey,
I used to be a terrorist."

15:48.840 --> 15:51.555
That's enough to drive a wedge
into any relationship.

15:51.781 --> 15:53.446
It could explain the donation.

16:27.035 --> 16:28.058
Hey.

16:28.144 --> 16:31.496
So, I'm going to check in
with all my old contacts.

16:31.719 --> 16:33.863
They weren't as deeply embedded
as Craig,

16:33.949 --> 16:36.844
but they might give a clearer
overall picture of what's going on.

16:37.065 --> 16:38.488
OK, but be careful.

16:38.574 --> 16:41.621
No, listen.
From now on, I do this on my own.

16:41.738 --> 16:43.816
I won't have any more contact
with you.

16:44.207 --> 16:46.472
Whatever I may or may not find out

16:46.613 --> 16:48.894
will be at my discretion
to divulge to the police.

16:48.980 --> 16:50.182
Orla...

16:50.267 --> 16:52.738
- Hello? Who's there?
- Orla?

16:53.271 --> 16:54.581
Orla!

16:59.936 --> 17:03.355
Quint, Orla Flanagan's house,
right now.

17:16.862 --> 17:19.698
Orla! Orla!

17:22.013 --> 17:23.455
Orla!

17:25.397 --> 17:26.588
Orla.

17:30.409 --> 17:32.174
She's alive. Orla!

17:32.259 --> 17:34.581
Orla, wake up.
Come on, wake up now.

17:34.969 --> 17:35.894
Orla.

17:35.980 --> 17:37.245
What's happening?

17:37.331 --> 17:39.885
Pulse is at 30. Dropping.

17:40.073 --> 17:44.135
Only visible injury is a head wound
above the left ear.

17:44.788 --> 17:48.291
Hello, Orla, can you hear me?
My name's Bryony.

17:48.485 --> 17:50.370
Orla, can you open your eyes for me?

17:50.745 --> 17:53.721
She's breathing, but I'm not getting
a response. Can we pulse check?

18:01.688 --> 18:02.846
Hey, Jack.

18:03.289 --> 18:05.666
- You all right?
- Yeah.

18:06.078 --> 18:08.182
I gather you know Orla Flanagan.

18:10.299 --> 18:11.791
I do.

18:11.955 --> 18:14.620
Listen, if you want to sit this one
out, that's...

18:14.706 --> 18:17.354
My swab is on file to eliminate me
from any...

18:17.440 --> 18:20.346
Yeah, that's not what I'm saying.
You know that.

18:22.497 --> 18:24.081
I need to do this.

18:24.938 --> 18:26.370
OK.

18:26.935 --> 18:28.213
Here if you need me, yeah?

18:31.760 --> 18:33.409
Windows are all intact.

18:33.495 --> 18:35.049
No sign of a break-in.

18:36.309 --> 18:39.838
Neither front nor balcony door
show signs of being forced.

18:40.368 --> 18:44.190
So she may have known her assailant,
and let him or her in?

18:47.786 --> 18:50.409
Fresh shiny striation marks
around the lock.

18:50.651 --> 18:52.120
Finer than a key.

18:52.399 --> 18:54.057
Intruder picks the lock...

18:54.765 --> 18:56.831
steps inside...

18:57.706 --> 18:59.480
knocks into this.

18:59.784 --> 19:02.174
So a man who's professional enough
to know how to pick locks

19:02.260 --> 19:03.597
without a trace,

19:03.847 --> 19:06.534
and then clumsily
knocks over a flowerpot.

19:10.847 --> 19:13.581
What was Orla's exact position
before I arrived?

19:14.581 --> 19:16.636
Her arms spread out to the side.

19:16.730 --> 19:18.464
Her shirt had been pulled open.

19:18.550 --> 19:20.259
I think a button was missing.

19:25.226 --> 19:26.269
Mm-hm.

19:31.666 --> 19:33.425
No sign of a weapon...

19:34.845 --> 19:39.988
or evidence that she hit her head
on the corner of the table,

19:40.104 --> 19:43.480
a wall, or any other hard,
angular surface.

19:47.578 --> 19:50.523
Standard laptop power plug.

19:51.038 --> 19:51.963
No laptop.

19:52.103 --> 19:53.214
Can't the laptop be tracked?

19:53.299 --> 19:55.433
Not without a network connection,
no.

20:03.394 --> 20:05.409
Mum? - Mm?

20:05.760 --> 20:07.190
Mum, it's Dad.

20:11.667 --> 20:13.722
Les, are you all right?
Where are you?

20:14.722 --> 20:16.863
<i>Everything's fine, guys.
I just, erm...</i>

20:18.259 --> 20:21.174
I just wanted to let you
know that... What's going on?

20:21.589 --> 20:23.214
Is your dad still alive?

20:23.675 --> 20:26.154
Erm, Marie, this will
all be over soon.

20:26.239 --> 20:27.245
What will be over?

20:27.331 --> 20:29.245
I just don't want you and the kids
to worry, OK?

20:29.331 --> 20:31.284
But everything...
everything is fine.

20:31.378 --> 20:33.378
Les, you can't do this to us.

20:33.558 --> 20:35.174
You need to come back right now.

20:35.300 --> 20:38.174
Yeah, look, I've got to go, Marie.

20:38.519 --> 20:40.194
I will be back as soon as I can,
all right?

20:40.279 --> 20:43.558
I promise you that.
I love you. Bye.

20:53.241 --> 20:55.761
- Dad?
- He's gone, darling.

21:00.239 --> 21:01.894
Dad's fine, babe. Come on.

21:03.239 --> 21:04.534
There you go.

21:13.298 --> 21:15.128
How's Orla doing?

21:16.877 --> 21:20.347
Erm, her vitals are stable now,
but there's parts

21:20.433 --> 21:22.769
of the brain haemorrhaging,
so they're keeping her under.

21:23.229 --> 21:25.581
And how are you holding up?
I'm all right, yeah.

21:25.769 --> 21:28.706
I'm not prying, Jack,
but I can see that you're suffering,

21:28.792 --> 21:30.534
and I don't like it.

21:38.229 --> 21:39.745
My Aunt Rosie...

21:40.804 --> 21:44.433
my dad's younger sister,
she was always round our house.

21:45.433 --> 21:47.886
Dad, he was like
a real big brother to her.

21:48.690 --> 21:52.863
Any time she went out, he'd drive
there and pick her up after,

21:52.949 --> 21:57.058
and... any boyfriend had to have Dad's
seal of approval - most didn't.

21:59.239 --> 22:01.219
Not even the man she married.

22:04.346 --> 22:08.656
One Saturday morning, Dad and I were
walking home after football practise

22:08.742 --> 22:14.350
and around the corner
there's an explosion, a big explosion,

22:14.436 --> 22:16.296
made the ground shake.

22:17.913 --> 22:20.538
Dad yelled at me, "Stay put."

22:21.880 --> 22:23.148
But I didn't.

22:23.765 --> 22:25.359
I followed round the corner.

22:26.890 --> 22:28.718
There was smoke and...

22:29.229 --> 22:30.538
debris and...

22:32.781 --> 22:36.460
there on the ground were
her black high-heeled shoes.

22:43.783 --> 22:45.952
My dad doesn't talk about it,
though.

22:47.116 --> 22:51.781
But I knew when he was thinking
about it because, he'd go walking.

22:53.445 --> 22:55.867
Sometimes he'd walk all night.

22:59.312 --> 23:00.859
I'm so sorry, Jack.

23:01.059 --> 23:03.343
- I never knew.
- Yeah.

23:06.867 --> 23:08.174
Mm.

23:08.259 --> 23:11.656
A small loyalist splinter group
claimed responsibility,

23:11.742 --> 23:16.195
but... word on the street was it had
been sanctioned by The Guild.

23:18.148 --> 23:21.113
Their target had been
an IRA commander.

23:21.773 --> 23:23.429
He got away.

23:24.367 --> 23:26.038
And the bombers...

23:27.885 --> 23:29.749
they got away, too.

24:01.239 --> 24:02.452
No whiskey?

24:02.632 --> 24:03.781
No whiskey.

24:04.288 --> 24:05.788
No bad memories?

24:07.353 --> 24:09.323
No old ones, anyway.

24:16.460 --> 24:19.452
- Late dinner?
- What's late when you're my age?

24:19.781 --> 24:21.343
There's a stew on the hob.

24:21.429 --> 24:24.577
Not a patch on your maw's
but help yourself.

24:28.172 --> 24:29.608
Good enough for me.

24:46.289 --> 24:49.117
Orla Flanagan's fingernails
are intact.

24:49.259 --> 24:53.695
No sign of defence wounds
on either hands or arms.

24:53.781 --> 24:58.194
Also substantial bruising to
the chest area here, can you see?

24:58.351 --> 24:59.820
She fractured two ribs.

24:59.906 --> 25:01.101
She was hit in the chest?

25:01.187 --> 25:02.554
Well, possible.

25:02.750 --> 25:05.523
But the bruising could also
indicate vigorous heart massage.

25:06.043 --> 25:10.153
Not me. This is the damage to
the scalp left by the instrument

25:10.239 --> 25:11.174
which struck her.

25:11.259 --> 25:13.812
X-rays show point of impact
just above the pterion,

25:13.898 --> 25:16.154
which resulted in a fracture
of the skull.

25:16.413 --> 25:18.163
She's lucky to be alive.

25:21.229 --> 25:24.219
CLOCK TOWER CHIMES

25:33.609 --> 25:36.726
Morning, gentlemen. Morning.
I'm looking for a Craig Greenwood?

25:36.843 --> 25:40.132
Yes, the chap with the
black car. He's just over the road.

25:46.259 --> 25:47.742
Craig Greenwood?

25:48.098 --> 25:50.538
Yes? DI Quint.

25:51.001 --> 25:52.946
This is DC Anderton.

25:53.249 --> 25:56.288
Do you know an Orla Flanagan?

25:58.134 --> 25:59.562
I've heard the name.

25:59.922 --> 26:03.117
Well, you met her,
yesterday afternoon.

26:04.492 --> 26:05.976
That's right.

26:06.757 --> 26:08.507
Why did you meet with Orla?

26:10.577 --> 26:12.214
She asked to meet.

26:12.710 --> 26:14.164
So, you know her from before?

26:14.374 --> 26:16.224
No, she told me she was working
on a history of the Troubles

26:16.309 --> 26:18.812
and felt that I could contribute.

26:19.102 --> 26:20.781
And what did you say?

26:21.024 --> 26:23.148
I told her to let sleeping dogs lie.

26:23.562 --> 26:26.304
And did you talk about an
organisation called The Guild?

26:27.031 --> 26:28.312
No.

26:29.436 --> 26:32.437
You and Miss Flanagan parted on
less than cordial terms yesterday.

26:32.657 --> 26:33.906
Did you threaten her?

26:35.913 --> 26:37.256
Is that what she told you?

26:37.390 --> 26:38.606
Nah.

26:39.679 --> 26:42.874
Where were you last night between
the hours of eight and 9pm?

26:43.028 --> 26:45.983
- At home, watching TV.
- Oh, yeah. What was on?

26:46.359 --> 26:48.015
Some reality show crap.

26:48.101 --> 26:49.327
I fell asleep.

26:49.468 --> 26:52.115
- No witnesses?
- No. What's happened?

26:52.382 --> 26:55.374
Orla Flanagan was the victim
of a serious assault last night.

26:58.028 --> 26:59.632
We'll speak again soon.

27:00.460 --> 27:02.219
Mr Greenwood.

27:03.279 --> 27:05.200
<i>That means a lot.
One of our most valued clients,</i>

27:05.289 --> 27:08.174
<i>we would of course offer you
a highly competitive rate.</i>

27:08.296 --> 27:11.773
Absolutely. I'd be delighted
to crunch some numbers with you.

27:14.468 --> 27:15.788
Who were those guys?

27:15.973 --> 27:18.868
Erm, it's some security checks.

27:19.040 --> 27:20.296
Detectives?

27:41.279 --> 27:43.218
How do you think Jack's doing?

27:43.914 --> 27:45.656
I think he's doing OK.

27:46.088 --> 27:47.101
Good.

27:47.437 --> 27:50.531
I'll keep an eye out.
But knowing Jack, he'll cope.

27:52.322 --> 27:54.484
Any worries, I need to know, yeah?

28:07.269 --> 28:09.242
So, how you doing these days, Craig?

28:10.269 --> 28:12.219
I'm fine, Mr Lawson.

28:13.484 --> 28:17.710
You know, it's funny.
We see each other every day...

28:18.789 --> 28:20.764
but we never really talk.

28:21.390 --> 28:23.827
I mean, not like in the old days.

28:25.249 --> 28:26.882
I guess not.

28:29.801 --> 28:32.117
We really must catch up.

28:33.249 --> 28:34.788
That'd be good.

28:56.114 --> 28:58.265
- <i>Quint?</i>
- I have an address.

29:01.734 --> 29:02.908
Police!

29:03.024 --> 29:04.335
Police!

29:07.466 --> 29:08.859
Clear!

29:30.728 --> 29:32.173
Codeine.

29:32.565 --> 29:34.164
Ibuprofen.

29:34.361 --> 29:36.151
GemCap.

29:37.031 --> 29:38.338
Pat's bandages.

29:49.557 --> 29:51.252
Laptops.

29:58.961 --> 30:00.236
See here?

30:15.732 --> 30:17.682
Blood.

30:31.790 --> 30:33.750
Careful.

30:40.050 --> 30:42.045
William McDonagh's?

30:42.791 --> 30:45.666
Clarissa might be able to do
something with this.

30:49.279 --> 30:52.154
Found two laptops
at Pat Walsh's hideout.

30:52.239 --> 30:53.740
One is Orla's.

30:53.844 --> 30:55.834
Both are password protected.

30:57.582 --> 31:00.677
This one is at least five years old.

31:00.763 --> 31:03.615
A veritable antique.
Shouldn't take too long.

31:03.755 --> 31:07.826
KM test on a substance found on the
corner of Orla's came out positive.

31:17.289 --> 31:19.885
Miss Lawson, Mr Lawson,
I'll see you tomorrow.

31:19.971 --> 31:23.182
Why don't you come in, Craig?
Join us for a drink.

31:23.377 --> 31:26.194
Oh, that's very kind of you,
Mr Lawson, but...

31:26.619 --> 31:29.214
Surely you can spare ten minutes,
Craig?

31:29.643 --> 31:31.144
Erm...

31:31.229 --> 31:32.502
Of course.

31:44.831 --> 31:47.612
I compared the corner of Orla's
laptop with the scan of her

31:47.729 --> 31:53.144
head wound and the linear mark on
the scalp matches the laptop corner.

31:53.229 --> 31:56.002
And those traces of blood are
a match for Orla Flanagan, right?

31:56.088 --> 31:57.838
- Yeah.
- I found fingerprints

31:57.924 --> 31:59.908
from both Pat and Les Walsh
on the laptop.

32:00.134 --> 32:03.151
Right. If you're finished, my turn.

32:06.447 --> 32:08.190
To the bad old days.

32:09.003 --> 32:10.846
- Bad old days.
- The bad old days.

32:14.983 --> 32:16.908
I always trusted you.

32:17.259 --> 32:21.184
Call it blind faith,
call it intuition.

32:21.518 --> 32:23.174
Thank you, sir.

32:23.582 --> 32:26.204
Do you remember
Orla Flanagan, Craig?

32:26.840 --> 32:31.684
The one who wrote those ridiculous
articles about our organisation?

32:32.551 --> 32:33.685
It was on the news this morning

32:33.770 --> 32:35.738
that she was the victim
of a serious assault

32:36.173 --> 32:39.153
and then the police show up,
talking to you.

32:41.933 --> 32:43.808
Is this an interrogation?

32:43.987 --> 32:45.442
Interrogation?

32:47.742 --> 32:49.793
That was your speciality.

32:50.082 --> 32:54.035
A couple of hours alone with you
and they'd all talk.

32:54.473 --> 32:56.629
What was your secret?

32:56.809 --> 32:58.879
I'm sure you don't want to know,
Mr Lawson.

32:59.982 --> 33:01.613
What I do know is

33:01.974 --> 33:04.942
I will not tolerate treachery.

33:06.598 --> 33:08.259
Is that a threat?

33:09.668 --> 33:12.629
Cos I can do threats,
if you like.

33:24.242 --> 33:25.750
Look, I understand.

33:26.219 --> 33:30.174
Talking to people
like Orla Flanagan can be useful.

33:30.359 --> 33:33.057
It lets people know
we're still here.

33:33.259 --> 33:38.774
But I need absolute loyalty.

33:41.279 --> 33:43.239
Can you give me that?

33:44.249 --> 33:46.453
I always did, Mr Lawson.

34:14.096 --> 34:15.703
OK, I'm in.

34:17.601 --> 34:22.313
This laptop was recently connected
to a number of free Wi-Fi sources.

34:22.547 --> 34:23.938
Search history.

34:24.279 --> 34:26.154
Various articles on the Guild.

34:26.239 --> 34:29.214
Most prominently,
Orla Flanagan's articles.

34:29.522 --> 34:32.224
Online conspiracy theories
about possible identities

34:32.309 --> 34:33.907
of members of the Guild.

34:33.993 --> 34:37.898
Unsuccessful searches
for Orla Flanagan's address,

34:38.099 --> 34:40.034
her phone number.

34:40.251 --> 34:41.712
Personal blog.

34:42.014 --> 34:43.704
And that's her street name.

34:44.094 --> 34:45.360
OK.

34:45.962 --> 34:48.469
Malloy most likely killed McDonagh,

34:48.797 --> 34:51.829
but not before McDonagh points him
in the direction of the Guild.

34:52.344 --> 34:55.907
Malloy and his son then track down
the expert on the Guild,

34:55.993 --> 34:58.149
Orla Flanagan,
but what does she tell them?

34:58.444 --> 35:01.407
If she did mention Lawson
or Greenwood by name...

35:03.462 --> 35:05.164
- Anderton.
- <i>Yeah?</i>

35:05.391 --> 35:07.399
Find out the phone number
and London address of

35:07.501 --> 35:09.485
a businessman, Ken Lawson.

35:29.875 --> 35:31.492
I can't do this.

35:32.229 --> 35:34.219
We're really close now, son.

35:39.249 --> 35:41.224
As soon as they confess,
we'll call the police.

35:41.309 --> 35:42.821
Course.

35:43.259 --> 35:44.891
You've done really well, son.

35:45.000 --> 35:46.239
Really well.

35:47.072 --> 35:50.742
Now, just stay sharp
and keep an eye on that door.

35:53.612 --> 35:54.821
Go on.

36:08.249 --> 36:10.194
Who the hell are you?

36:10.977 --> 36:12.957
What do you want?

36:17.854 --> 36:19.794
Malloy?

36:20.401 --> 36:22.502
Niall Malloy.

36:22.784 --> 36:24.916
The Fenian Bomber.

36:26.269 --> 36:28.239
<i>I thought you died years ago.</i>

36:34.478 --> 36:37.518
Did you have a bomb
planted in my car?

36:38.557 --> 36:41.315
If you're referring to old
allegations about the Guild...

36:41.401 --> 36:43.932
Did you sanction
my wife's murder?

36:44.018 --> 36:45.901
How does it feel, Malloy?

36:49.862 --> 36:52.777
Your bombs killed
over 60 innocent civilians.

36:52.962 --> 36:55.173
<i>We would never stoop so low.</i>

36:55.259 --> 36:58.154
<i>Now you know how every
bereaved family member felt.</i>

36:58.239 --> 37:00.239
I believed in the armed struggle.

37:02.002 --> 37:03.541
But it was never easy.

37:05.393 --> 37:07.869
In the end
I couldn't do it any more.

37:08.924 --> 37:10.174
I had to leave.

37:10.354 --> 37:12.408
You're a mass murderer.

37:14.239 --> 37:17.154
I did what I thought
was right at the time.

37:17.239 --> 37:19.167
Oh, is that what you tell yourself
so you can sleep at night?

37:19.252 --> 37:20.971
- Geraldine!
- No, you're just as bad

37:21.057 --> 37:23.901
for doing nothing,
for letting murderers walk free.

37:28.752 --> 37:32.713
Of course. That makes sense.

37:34.471 --> 37:38.471
They've moved on.
But you...

37:40.309 --> 37:44.963
There's nobody more self-righteous
and judgmental than the young.

37:45.718 --> 37:49.455
Only a person who doesn't know what
war is would want to start one.

37:49.541 --> 37:51.276
I'm not starting anything.

37:51.485 --> 37:55.213
People back home want justice.
Strength.

37:55.901 --> 37:57.471
We're going to give it to them.

37:57.666 --> 37:59.768
By killing old men
that nobody cares about?

37:59.854 --> 38:02.424
By making it clear that
no-one gets away with it.

38:05.688 --> 38:07.638
That includes you.

38:12.009 --> 38:15.260
Mr Lawson! Police!

38:16.289 --> 38:18.249
Open up, please!

38:27.249 --> 38:28.580
Don't!

38:30.289 --> 38:31.752
Is all that true?

38:31.838 --> 38:33.773
Niall Malloy,
is that your real name?

38:33.884 --> 38:35.789
- Les.
- Bomb-maker?

38:35.898 --> 38:37.863
We can talk about this later.

38:38.034 --> 38:40.939
You killed 60 innocent people.

38:41.686 --> 38:43.143
Children.

38:46.188 --> 38:50.846
If we let these people live,
they'll come after us.

38:52.580 --> 38:55.885
Killing more people
will not bring justice for Mum.

39:00.239 --> 39:02.239
GUNSHOT

39:05.566 --> 39:08.347
LES SCREAMS

39:14.136 --> 39:15.653
What's going on?
A gunshot's been fired.

39:15.738 --> 39:18.206
- We think Mr Lawson's still inside.
- OK.

39:24.269 --> 39:26.714
Did you sanction my wife's murder?

39:32.581 --> 39:34.268
This stops now.

39:34.354 --> 39:35.374
GUN COCKS

39:36.826 --> 39:39.042
No, no, no! Dad, dad.
Dad, stop.

39:39.150 --> 39:41.480
OK? Stop this. This isn't you.

39:41.581 --> 39:43.184
You don't know me.

39:43.480 --> 39:45.239
You never knew me.

39:46.691 --> 39:48.636
OK, maybe I didn't.

39:48.986 --> 39:50.863
But Mum did, didn't she?

39:51.909 --> 39:53.878
She knew who you were.

39:54.613 --> 39:56.269
She knew what you were.

39:57.597 --> 39:59.204
She forgave you.

39:59.875 --> 40:01.815
Because that was Mum.

40:02.432 --> 40:04.869
She was willing to
give you a second chance.

40:06.384 --> 40:07.404
No!

40:08.279 --> 40:09.279
Go!

40:14.167 --> 40:16.087
HE YELLS

40:17.239 --> 40:18.309
GUNSHOT

41:11.239 --> 41:13.239
HANDCUFFS CLICK

41:16.300 --> 41:19.022
We also believe that
he shot his father.

41:21.270 --> 41:23.125
That's not possible.

41:25.177 --> 41:28.412
Can I speak to Les?
The kids want to see him.

41:29.483 --> 41:31.834
I'm afraid that will
have to wait, Marie,

41:32.228 --> 41:35.133
but Forensics have finished
examining your house.

41:35.249 --> 41:36.873
You can go back home now.

41:40.769 --> 41:43.214
I know this is very hard.

41:43.972 --> 41:46.534
You can call me
any time you want to talk.

42:04.825 --> 42:06.651
What's happened?

42:08.605 --> 42:10.331
____

42:10.417 --> 42:12.073
We're going home.

42:13.259 --> 42:15.299
DISTANT SIRENS

42:17.269 --> 42:19.503
And this is the last file
Orla was working on.

42:19.690 --> 42:21.628
Notes on our chat in the bar,

42:21.714 --> 42:25.219
on her meeting with Ken Lawson's
chauffeur, Craig Greenwood.

42:26.922 --> 42:30.193
In search,
see what else she has on the Guild.

42:37.081 --> 42:38.184
Nothing new here.

42:38.315 --> 42:40.184
What about Niall Malloy?

42:40.362 --> 42:41.972
Does she have anything on him?

42:46.987 --> 42:50.214
E-mails between
Orla and Alex Harris?

42:50.737 --> 42:52.347
Alex Harris?

42:54.259 --> 42:55.433
Let's see.

42:55.573 --> 42:57.550
They're from eight years back.

42:58.455 --> 43:01.714
Alex Harris is asking her about

43:01.800 --> 43:06.229
the Guild's possible involvement in
Malloy's disappearance in the '90s?

43:10.092 --> 43:12.815
Whether she knows anything more
than the official story?

43:12.901 --> 43:16.589
Orla isn't forthcoming.
Asks him why he wants to know.

43:21.318 --> 43:22.722
Oh, my God.

43:31.259 --> 43:33.706
Sir, will you come with us?

43:34.934 --> 43:36.884
Yeah, sure.

43:39.408 --> 43:43.495
December 28.
30 years ago.

43:44.472 --> 43:47.331
An IRA bomb
rips through central Belfast.

43:47.791 --> 43:49.741
Among the victims...

43:52.145 --> 43:54.448
one Andrea Patterson.

43:59.165 --> 44:01.130
According to
the Belfast Telegraph,

44:01.269 --> 44:04.776
Miss Paterson was over for
a holiday with her boyfriend,

44:05.277 --> 44:06.769
an Alex Harris.

44:08.362 --> 44:09.972
Harris survived.

44:11.417 --> 44:14.776
In a brief interview with
the newspaper,

44:14.862 --> 44:16.503
Harris said that his
girlfriend was

44:16.589 --> 44:18.753
five months pregnant with
his child at the time.

44:22.185 --> 44:27.167
The bomb was later attributed to
Republican bomb-maker Niall Malloy.

44:29.448 --> 44:33.249
You live only a few streets down
from Will McDonagh.

44:36.823 --> 44:39.659
You could have recognised him
in the paper, visited him,

44:40.219 --> 44:42.194
found out from him
where Niall Malloy was hiding.

44:42.279 --> 44:44.534
That's a lot of could-haves.

44:50.003 --> 44:53.918
You befriended
Malloy's wife, seduced her,

44:54.355 --> 44:57.487
planned your attack meticulously
but you got it wrong.

44:59.259 --> 45:00.925
Malloy got away.

45:01.401 --> 45:04.323
My client has
nothing further to add.

45:53.087 --> 45:54.933
Did you get that? Plans?

45:57.003 --> 45:58.401
Got it.

46:02.798 --> 46:04.447
Mr Harris...

46:06.259 --> 46:08.689
You went to a lot of trouble
to construct the IED

46:08.775 --> 46:12.214
using the same methods as
Niall Malloy did in the 1980s.

46:12.611 --> 46:14.970
Down to the last detail.

46:17.930 --> 46:23.697
Everything here speaks of a man
who knows exactly what he's doing.

46:23.783 --> 46:27.572
<i>Maybe he set that bomb off precisely
at the moment of his choosing.</i>

46:30.259 --> 46:32.752
You kill a man once and he's gone.

46:33.993 --> 46:37.983
Kill what he loves
and he dies every day.

46:40.658 --> 46:43.009
- MI should know.
- Alex...

46:44.697 --> 46:47.299
You intended to kill
Olivia Walsh.

46:48.680 --> 46:50.197
I followed them.

46:51.183 --> 46:54.861
Waiting for a chance to catch
Olivia on her own in the car.

46:55.275 --> 46:58.213
So Malloy could feel
what I felt.

46:59.509 --> 47:00.728
30 years ago.

47:00.815 --> 47:03.720
Olivia Walsh was innocent
of her husband's crimes.

47:03.890 --> 47:05.447
She protected him.

47:06.416 --> 47:08.455
She was guilty, all right.

47:08.870 --> 47:13.064
Did you act with or on behalf
of a group calling itself the Guild?

47:14.042 --> 47:18.049
<i>I've got a wrapper here
for 500g of Semtex.</i>

47:19.219 --> 47:23.486
<i>The device that killed
Olivia Walsh was about 250g.</i>

47:23.878 --> 47:27.150
<i>I'd say there's about 150g left.</i>

47:28.773 --> 47:32.299
<i>That leaves another
100g of Semtex unaccounted for.</i>

47:33.269 --> 47:35.541
100g of
Semtex unaccounted for.

47:38.335 --> 47:40.305
Where's the second bomb?

47:43.249 --> 47:47.154
<i>Malloy's lost his wife.
His only son is in a prison cell.</i>

47:47.239 --> 47:49.259
That leaves...
Malloy's grandchildren.

47:56.823 --> 47:58.564
Mum, the keys.

48:05.331 --> 48:07.351
I must have left them
in my coat pocket.

48:18.279 --> 48:20.341
Mum! They're in your bag.

48:20.427 --> 48:22.219
All right, you two, go in.

48:26.079 --> 48:28.442
It's not that one. It's this one.

48:33.252 --> 48:34.598
Marie speaking.

48:34.684 --> 48:36.229
See, I told you.

48:37.810 --> 48:39.665
(DOOR CLICKS OPEN

48:39.765 --> 48:40.898
Darling, no!

48:40.984 --> 48:42.664
Get away from the house!

48:57.968 --> 49:00.998
HIGH-PITCHED RINGING

49:21.279 --> 49:25.194
MARIE SOBS

49:25.279 --> 49:27.299
MUFFLED SHOUTING

49:57.269 --> 50:00.259
DISTANT SIRENS

50:40.544 --> 50:42.194
You know, the funny thing is,

50:42.426 --> 50:46.981
if they'd told me the truth
right away, about the IRA,

50:47.450 --> 50:51.184
about the bombs, I'd have
probably helped him anyway,

50:51.442 --> 50:53.661
but I never meant
for anyone to get hurt.

50:53.879 --> 50:55.942
Then why attack Orla Flanagan?

50:58.239 --> 50:59.864
Because she wouldn't talk.

51:01.005 --> 51:03.216
She had her laptop opened

51:03.364 --> 51:05.739
and I could see what story
she was working on,

51:05.825 --> 51:08.075
the Guild, and then Lawson...

51:10.943 --> 51:14.512
So she reached for the gun.
She took my dad's mask off

51:14.598 --> 51:17.204
and I just lashed out
at her with the laptop.

51:17.362 --> 51:18.966
And...

51:27.880 --> 51:30.293
She... She fell.

51:31.008 --> 51:34.833
I tried to find a pulse
but there just wasn't one.

51:35.803 --> 51:38.786
So I tried to give her CPR.

51:44.239 --> 51:45.911
And then we just ran.

51:49.524 --> 51:51.464
We just ran.

52:05.979 --> 52:07.969
Hey.

52:09.364 --> 52:12.856
DC Anderton told me
they'd woken you up.

52:13.133 --> 52:14.464
Hey.

52:14.550 --> 52:16.203
How are you feeling?

52:17.325 --> 52:21.676
Like 50 elephants are
having a rave inside my skull.

52:23.045 --> 52:25.960
Orla, I'm so sorry
I got you into this.

52:26.279 --> 52:28.044
I got myself into it.

52:28.934 --> 52:30.203
Now...

52:30.606 --> 52:32.841
Get me a pen and some paper.

52:33.164 --> 52:35.434
Orla, you need your rest.
You've a fractured skull.

52:35.520 --> 52:38.489
Yeah, I also have
a bloody good story on my hands.

52:38.575 --> 52:40.591
I need to get the details down.

52:40.845 --> 52:43.780
You're a stubborn obsessive,
aren't you, Flanagan?

52:44.140 --> 52:46.450
Takes one to know one, Hodgson.

52:54.547 --> 52:55.919
I mean it.

52:56.365 --> 52:59.427
Pen and paper. Now.

53:02.647 --> 53:06.552
Miss Lawson! Miss Lawson, was the
attack on you politically motivated?

53:06.754 --> 53:08.731
Understandably, my father and I

53:08.817 --> 53:10.966
have been deeply shaken
by this turn of events

53:11.091 --> 53:14.270
and we are extremely grateful to
the police for their heroic efforts.

53:14.474 --> 53:17.677
<i>What this incident does prove
is that the past is still very much</i>

53:17.763 --> 53:21.325
<i>with us and we must seize this
opportunity to face up to that past,</i>

53:21.552 --> 53:25.164
<i>to not sweep it under the carpet
but to bring justice</i>

53:25.249 --> 53:28.591
<i>and new leadership to those people
who feel they're been forgotten.</i>

53:38.727 --> 53:41.110
Hi. Can I help you?

53:41.259 --> 53:43.492
I'm looking for Jack Hodgson.

53:43.651 --> 53:45.596
You must be Mr Hodgson.

53:46.259 --> 53:48.469
Nicki Alexander. Lovely to meet you.

53:48.555 --> 53:51.719
Jack speaks very highly of you,
Dr Alexander.

53:51.805 --> 53:55.891
That's very kind. Come in.
Jack should be back in a minute.

53:55.977 --> 53:57.391
Can I get you a coffee?

53:57.477 --> 53:59.860
Thank you. Black, no sugar.

54:09.165 --> 54:12.080
I hope I'm not interrupting
any important business.

54:12.330 --> 54:13.602
Not at all.

54:14.390 --> 54:16.633
- Thank you.
- Pleasure.

54:18.091 --> 54:20.633
Jack's business
has always been his own.

54:20.970 --> 54:24.875
When he was a boy there was
a big "stay out" sign on his door.

54:25.000 --> 54:26.805
Some things never change.

54:27.391 --> 54:30.141
Sometimes on the news
I see reports of murders,

54:30.227 --> 54:34.102
<i>of innocent people being killed,

brought to justice,</i>

54:37.228 --> 54:38.805

54:38.950 --> 54:42.696

54:56.867 --> 54:58.194
Hey, Dad.

54:58.873 --> 55:00.833

55:01.887 --> 55:03.827
Just out for a walk.

Thanks.
