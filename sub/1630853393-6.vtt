00:06.006 --> 00:08.925
<i>You never know</i>
<i>if you picked the right jury or not.</i>

00:09.009 --> 00:11.052
<i>That's why</i>
<i>they call them the Gods of Guilt.</i>

00:11.136 --> 00:14.305
Let me be clear. No jury consultant.

00:15.265 --> 00:17.976
You think there's a chance
Elliott might be innocent?

00:18.059 --> 00:21.521
He says he is. In my business
that would be what we call a unicorn.

00:21.604 --> 00:23.565
-You ever have one before?
-Yeah.

00:23.648 --> 00:27.694
<i>-A guy named Jesús Menendez.</i>
-<i>Your lead witness is dead.</i>

00:27.777 --> 00:29.404
Angelo Soto had him killed.

00:29.487 --> 00:31.948
Without your witness,
the case falls apart.

00:32.032 --> 00:33.950
Tanya Cruz, 26.

00:34.034 --> 00:36.119
If we turn her,
maybe she gives us the shooter.

00:36.202 --> 00:38.747
You'll need a lawyer. Trust him.

00:41.750 --> 00:45.003
I'm sorry. Whoever that was,
that was not me.

00:45.587 --> 00:47.338
-It felt like you.
-Mickey.

00:47.422 --> 00:50.091
<i>How will you</i>
<i>talk about your cases in a bugged car?</i>

00:50.175 --> 00:53.386
If we take it out, whoever planted it
will know we're on to them.

00:53.470 --> 00:56.014
You know, I left a motorcycle club
to work for you,

00:56.097 --> 00:59.059
and somehow my life's gotten even crazier.

00:59.142 --> 01:02.645
One of our boys needs help.
Hard Case Casey.

01:02.729 --> 01:05.065
Say hi to Cisco for me.

01:05.148 --> 01:09.027
We've got missing money.
We've got mystery calls from the Feds.

01:09.110 --> 01:11.488
Lot of pressure
to beat a high-profile murder like that.

01:11.571 --> 01:14.157
What if the money was for a bribe?

01:34.677 --> 01:38.014
-Haller, hey.
-All right. Yes.

01:38.098 --> 01:39.849
-How're you feeling, Mickey?
-Confident.

01:39.933 --> 01:42.685
LAPD got the wrong man.
Anyone can see that.

01:42.769 --> 01:45.271
-Even you, Connelly.
-You're sure you're gonna win?

01:45.355 --> 01:48.775
Here's what I'm sure of.
Devin Jones is innocent.

01:48.858 --> 01:53.196
Whatever else you guys print, print that.
Excuse me, fellas.

01:55.907 --> 01:58.910
Hey, kiddo. What did you think
of your old man in there, huh?

01:58.993 --> 01:59.994
You're so good.

02:00.078 --> 02:04.207
<i>Miguelito,</i> I have to make
a phone call. Stay with your papa, okay?

02:04.290 --> 02:06.000
-Okay, Mom.
-Elena.

02:08.044 --> 02:09.546
I hope you got the part.

02:17.846 --> 02:20.682
I wish you and your mom
didn't have to go back so soon.

02:20.765 --> 02:22.725
Your visits go by so fast.

02:23.768 --> 02:25.520
But I'm glad you got to see this.

02:26.437 --> 02:29.149
-This one was important.
-Why?

02:31.526 --> 02:33.862
Eh, because most of my clients have money.

02:34.696 --> 02:39.576
You know, money makes people think
they can do anything and get away with it.

02:40.285 --> 02:41.744
This one was different.

02:41.828 --> 02:45.415
He didn't do it.
And I took his case for free

02:46.166 --> 02:48.084
because it was the right thing to do.

02:49.377 --> 02:50.211
You understand?

02:51.504 --> 02:54.591
But that also makes it
one of the hardest cases I've ever had.

02:56.968 --> 02:58.344
You should go talk to him.

02:58.428 --> 02:59.804
Okay, Legal.

03:00.847 --> 03:01.848
Be right back.

03:08.438 --> 03:09.647
I got something for you.

03:13.902 --> 03:16.029
They don't allow cameras in the courtroom.

03:16.112 --> 03:19.157
So this is what they put
on the evening news.

03:19.240 --> 03:20.533
They put these on TV?

03:22.118 --> 03:25.330
You keep that.
Anybody asks you who it is,

03:26.080 --> 03:28.374
you tell 'em
it's the best damn lawyer in LA.

03:31.211 --> 03:34.631
Look at you,
making the front page.

03:36.174 --> 03:40.178
-Your old man would be proud.
-He lived on the front page.

03:40.261 --> 03:41.471
How's your defense?

03:43.556 --> 03:44.599
Thin.

03:44.682 --> 03:48.019
You think you're the first lawyer
to go in with a flimsy case?

03:48.102 --> 03:52.357
-Your father and I thrived on it.
-I got a lot riding on this one, Legal.

03:53.149 --> 03:56.402
-Been out of the game for a year.
-You're looking for a pep talk?

03:57.070 --> 04:00.865
"If you got the facts, pound the facts.
If you have the law, pound the law."

04:00.949 --> 04:02.784
"And if you don't have either one,

04:02.867 --> 04:04.827
-pound the table."
-"Pound the table."

04:04.911 --> 04:06.537
Yeah, I've heard that one.

04:08.581 --> 04:10.875
I think Jerry Vincent
may have paid a bribe.

04:10.959 --> 04:12.877
-To who?
-I don't know yet.

04:12.961 --> 04:16.839
I don't know if it's true. But there's
money missing. Couple of months now.

04:16.923 --> 04:19.509
There is only three people
it could be, right?

04:19.592 --> 04:22.720
The judge, a juror
or maybe the prosecutor.

04:22.804 --> 04:26.849
No. This DA, Golantz, he'd run over
his own mother to win a case.

04:27.642 --> 04:30.603
-He comes from money too.
-Well, you just picked a jury.

04:31.271 --> 04:34.691
You said this money's been missing
for a couple of months.

04:34.774 --> 04:35.775
Yep.

04:35.858 --> 04:38.152
So you may have the judge in your pocket.

04:38.236 --> 04:41.489
Well, I don't have anybody in my pocket.
I didn't do anything.

04:41.572 --> 04:45.118
Exactly. Now I know
why you wanted to talk to me.

04:45.201 --> 04:46.828
You wanna know what he would do.

04:49.080 --> 04:50.206
So?

04:50.290 --> 04:56.004
If your dad inherited a case from a lawyer
and then found out that he paid a bribe,

04:56.087 --> 05:00.341
he wouldn't do a damn thing.
He'd take it as a sign from God.

05:01.342 --> 05:03.011
Anybody else know about this?

05:03.636 --> 05:06.431
Yeah, the cop
investigating Jerry's murder.

05:06.514 --> 05:09.309
-The one who put me onto it.
-What about your client?

05:09.392 --> 05:13.604
I haven't asked him. There's just…
There is no proof. It's only a theory.

05:13.688 --> 05:15.189
Then go prepare your case.

05:15.273 --> 05:18.609
And don't ask questions
you don't want answers to.

05:24.240 --> 05:27.201
First wife? You got to take that one.

05:27.285 --> 05:29.787
I speak from experience.

05:29.871 --> 05:30.955
Hey!

05:45.636 --> 05:48.681
<i>Take the gun. We might need it.</i>

05:53.644 --> 05:54.562
Come in.

05:55.938 --> 05:56.939
Hello, <i>amor.</i>

05:57.690 --> 05:58.524
Hey.

05:59.567 --> 06:00.735
Is that…

06:03.279 --> 06:06.491
Yeah. Everyone's still playing it,
even though…

06:06.574 --> 06:08.868
Well… you know.

06:11.329 --> 06:12.205
Did Mom call you?

06:12.997 --> 06:13.915
Yeah.

06:14.749 --> 06:16.459
She said
you didn't go to school.

06:19.379 --> 06:21.214
Don't you have a trial?

06:23.132 --> 06:24.217
Starts Monday.

06:25.468 --> 06:27.220
Look, Hayley, I, uh…

06:28.513 --> 06:30.473
I know what you saw the other day.

06:31.182 --> 06:32.308
It's a lot for anyone.

06:33.476 --> 06:34.519
Wanna talk about it?

06:37.563 --> 06:38.398
Okay.

06:40.233 --> 06:42.693
If you ever do,
you know, I'm here for you.

06:45.113 --> 06:48.241
Can I ask you something?
The person who killed Mom's witness…

06:48.324 --> 06:49.283
Mmm-hmm.

06:49.367 --> 06:50.618
Would you represent them?

06:51.953 --> 06:54.163
Everyone deserves a defense, Hayley.

06:54.247 --> 06:58.167
But would you defend them?
Knowing what they did?

06:59.293 --> 07:03.005
It's more complicated
than just yes or no, Hayley.

07:03.089 --> 07:04.549
-Why?
-Because you know why.

07:04.632 --> 07:05.842
We've talked about this.

07:05.925 --> 07:10.972
No. I know what you tell me about your dad
and about innocent until proven guilty.

07:11.055 --> 07:12.306
But what about you?

07:13.224 --> 07:14.934
Okay? Where do you draw the line?

07:16.561 --> 07:18.563
I mean, do you have a line?

07:18.646 --> 07:20.273
Yes. I have a line. I…

07:21.858 --> 07:25.236
For example, I don't represent people
who hurt kids. All right?

07:28.614 --> 07:31.033
That's good, I guess.

07:32.493 --> 07:33.953
Yeah, come on. Hayley.

07:39.834 --> 07:42.712
-Can't get her to open up for ya?
-No, not exactly.

07:42.795 --> 07:44.714
Sometimes you just need to take a day.

07:44.797 --> 07:45.631
Mmm.

07:46.215 --> 07:49.302
So, uh, you had a favor
you wanted to ask me?

07:49.385 --> 07:52.054
Yeah, it's a cooperating witness.

07:52.138 --> 07:54.140
She needs someone
to negotiate her CI deal.

07:55.016 --> 07:57.435
Yeah. Sure. After my trial. No problem.

07:57.518 --> 07:59.437
Well, thing is I need it now.

08:00.396 --> 08:02.773
Now? Come on, Maggie. I'm like…

08:02.857 --> 08:04.775
This is the guy who killed my witness.

08:05.693 --> 08:08.863
And Janelle is threatening
to pull the plug on the whole thing.

08:08.946 --> 08:11.115
I wouldn't ask if it wasn't important.

08:11.824 --> 08:14.535
All right, Mag. All right.
I need something too.

08:14.619 --> 08:17.288
Can you bring Hayley
to court on Monday? To see my opening?

08:17.371 --> 08:19.707
It's a murder trial.
After what she just saw?

08:19.790 --> 08:22.877
Just my opening. I promise you.
No gore, no blood.

08:22.960 --> 08:26.631
-You won't be nervous having her there?
-Absolutely, yes.

08:26.714 --> 08:29.592
I'm thinking a few nerves
might do me some good, you know?

08:32.220 --> 08:33.554
-Okay.
-Thank you.

08:34.347 --> 08:38.601
Oh, and your witness already called me.
I'm seeing her tomorrow.

08:38.684 --> 08:39.519
Asshole.

08:39.602 --> 08:43.189
<i>Robert Cardone</i>
<i>wants you to think he's a reformer.</i>

08:43.272 --> 08:44.190
Speak of the devil.

08:44.273 --> 08:47.026
<i>During his tenure as head</i>
<i>of the Conviction Review Unit,</i>

08:47.109 --> 08:50.404
<i>LA saw the most</i>
<i>officer involved incidents in history.</i>

08:50.488 --> 08:54.325
<i>Don't be fooled by Robert Cardone.</i>
<i>He's wrong for District Attorney.</i>

08:54.408 --> 08:55.535
<i>Wrong for Los Angeles.</i>

08:55.618 --> 08:58.329
<i>I'm Janelle Simmons,</i>
<i>and I approve this message.</i>

08:58.412 --> 09:00.998
Remind me never to run for DA.

09:01.082 --> 09:02.833
You'd do a lot better than any of 'em.

09:02.917 --> 09:06.170
She's having her fundraiser tomorrow.
Asked me to introduce her.

09:06.254 --> 09:08.464
-This I gotta see.
-No. You really don't.

09:08.548 --> 09:11.676
-No, I really do.
-Seriously? You wanna come?

09:11.759 --> 09:12.593
Yeah.

09:12.677 --> 09:15.137
I didn't think
I could get anyone to buy tickets.

09:15.221 --> 09:18.474
We could hammer out
cooperation agreement? Two birds?

09:18.558 --> 09:22.478
How can I refuse that invitation?
I'll see you in there, McFierce.

09:22.562 --> 09:23.521
Okay.

09:30.486 --> 09:31.654
Tunnel vision.

09:33.114 --> 09:35.449
That's our story.
Target wasn't Lara Elliott.

09:35.533 --> 09:40.204
It was her boyfriend who was killed by
another jealous husband, Anton Shavar.

09:40.288 --> 09:43.165
Dangerous, violent man
and the cops never looked into him.

09:43.249 --> 09:47.044
Supporting this story,
no murder weapon was found.

09:47.128 --> 09:50.006
But Trevor Elliott
had gunshot residue on his hands.

09:50.089 --> 09:52.133
I have a plan.
Lorna, call Tony Walsh.

09:52.216 --> 09:55.886
Invite him to the fundraiser,
you guys should come too. It's on me.

09:55.970 --> 09:58.889
-Mickey--
-Gotta spend money to make money.

09:58.973 --> 10:01.309
Now, there was a woman
quoted in the paper.

10:01.392 --> 10:03.102
Sonia Patel, old friend of Lara.

10:03.185 --> 10:06.856
Yeah, I saw that but it said
she hadn't seen Lara in years.

10:06.939 --> 10:08.649
According to Lara's cell phone log,

10:08.733 --> 10:11.068
she called Sonia
two days before the murder.

10:11.152 --> 10:12.612
You think she knew something?

10:12.695 --> 10:15.239
I don't know.
But what if we had tunnel vision?

10:15.323 --> 10:17.074
What if Lara Elliott had enemies?

10:17.158 --> 10:22.622
Sonia Patel. She's a software engineer
at Chaos Games in Culver City.

10:23.331 --> 10:26.334
-I'll run her down.
-No, I'll take care of that.

10:27.168 --> 10:29.003
Something else I need from you two.

10:29.837 --> 10:31.005
Well, what's that?

10:31.839 --> 10:33.841
I'm worried Jerry may have paid a bribe.

10:33.924 --> 10:37.011
And my best guess,
it went to Judge Stanton.

10:37.678 --> 10:38.512
What?

10:38.596 --> 10:41.474
We know when that 100 grand
left Jerry's account.

10:41.557 --> 10:43.851
I need you to find out
if it went to Stanton.

10:43.934 --> 10:45.645
You're talking about looking into a judge.

10:45.728 --> 10:49.315
I know. Which is why I'm trusting you
to be really careful with this.

10:49.398 --> 10:53.152
He's an elected official. Most of his
financial information's public.

10:53.235 --> 10:55.571
Great. Get on it. Anything else?

10:55.655 --> 10:59.575
Yes. Uh, you have your case
status update at 11:00 with Judge Holder.

11:00.534 --> 11:02.119
-11:00? Lorna, it--
-I'm sorry.

11:02.203 --> 11:05.831
I would have told you sooner,
but you threw me with this skulduggery.

11:08.417 --> 11:10.086
Your Honor, you wanted to see me?

11:10.169 --> 11:14.757
I did. Have a seat, Mr. Haller,
and please take out your checkbook.

11:14.840 --> 11:15.800
My checkbook?

11:16.717 --> 11:18.302
You're ten minutes late.

11:18.386 --> 11:20.012
I can hold you in contempt,

11:20.096 --> 11:23.140
or you can make a contribution
to the charity of your choice.

11:23.224 --> 11:26.519
It's up to you. I leave a list
of my favorites on the desk.

11:27.770 --> 11:31.315
Right, Your Honor. I'm sorry,
but I don't have my checkbook on me.

11:33.651 --> 11:35.653
I'll have my office send something over.

11:35.736 --> 11:38.447
Very well. I'll leave
the amount up to you, of course.

11:40.533 --> 11:45.246
So… With the Elliott trial set to begin
on Monday, I just wanted to check in.

11:45.913 --> 11:49.333
I've appreciated the email updates
on Jerry Vincent's other clients.

11:49.417 --> 11:51.252
It seems you've had your hands full.

11:51.335 --> 11:54.964
Oh, yeah, but I promise
no one is being neglected.

11:55.047 --> 11:57.550
I'm just happy to be back to work.

11:57.633 --> 11:58.467
Good.

11:59.343 --> 12:03.013
Everyone is still in shock
over Mr. Vincent's murder.

12:03.097 --> 12:07.143
You know, my husband knew him a little.
Mitch Lester?

12:07.226 --> 12:09.061
He's a defense attorney also.

12:09.145 --> 12:12.189
He was at a memorial
for Mr. Vincent this past week.

12:14.275 --> 12:17.945
-Oh, and he saw me there.
-It's not just my concern.

12:18.028 --> 12:20.281
The State Bar is aware of your situation.

12:20.364 --> 12:23.242
I didn't fall off the wagon,
if that's what you're asking.

12:23.325 --> 12:26.370
I've been going to meetings.
I have paperwork. I can bring--

12:26.454 --> 12:28.330
Oh, no, that won't be necessary.

12:28.414 --> 12:31.250
I've had family members
with these issues, Mr. Haller.

12:31.333 --> 12:33.794
My father lived with it his whole life.

12:34.503 --> 12:37.882
I just wanna make sure there isn't
a problem that I could help with.

12:37.965 --> 12:41.677
No, I appreciate that, Judge.
But no, there's no problem.

12:41.761 --> 12:46.932
Very well. Then we're done here.
Thank you for keeping me abreast.

12:47.016 --> 12:48.017
It's okay.

12:48.976 --> 12:50.311
And, Mr. Haller…

12:51.520 --> 12:53.606
I wish you luck with the trial next week.

12:56.400 --> 12:57.818
Thank you, Your Honor.

13:01.864 --> 13:04.784
Get off there, you… Jeez.

13:13.459 --> 13:15.878
I got those records on Judge Stanton.

13:15.961 --> 13:18.672
What's Harold Casey
doing in Mickey's calendar?

13:18.756 --> 13:20.591
No idea. Why?

13:20.674 --> 13:21.592
Ugh.

13:22.384 --> 13:25.513
He's a guy I used to roll with
when I was in the Road Saints.

13:25.596 --> 13:26.555
Okay.

13:29.558 --> 13:31.268
Um, should I be concerned?

13:33.479 --> 13:35.981
That's ancient history.

13:37.441 --> 13:40.736
-What are we looking at?
-Continental Café. It's Mid-City.

13:40.820 --> 13:41.821
It's very chi-chi.

13:41.904 --> 13:45.241
Judge Stanton's name is on the lease
and it closed down a year ago.

13:46.659 --> 13:48.077
Huh. He was an investor?

13:48.160 --> 13:51.956
Not exactly. Here he is
at the opening with the head chef.

13:52.039 --> 13:53.749
And here they are exchanging vows.

13:53.833 --> 13:54.667
Aw.

13:55.459 --> 13:58.504
So Stanton invested in his
husband's restaurant.

13:59.296 --> 14:02.258
It closes down.
That could put him in debt.

14:02.341 --> 14:08.055
Yes, but it reopened two months ago.
Modern Muse Bistro.

14:09.723 --> 14:13.102
-Is Stanton still an owner?
-Why don't we find out tomorrow?

14:13.185 --> 14:15.855
I booked us a reservation
for a food tasting.

14:15.938 --> 14:18.858
Only, as a couple
scouting for a wedding venue.

14:18.941 --> 14:20.359
And that is just brilliant.

14:23.195 --> 14:25.030
May I never cease to amaze you.

14:30.870 --> 14:33.455
-Sonia Patel?
-Yeah?

14:34.248 --> 14:37.501
My name is Mickey Haller.
I'm an attorney. I represent--

14:37.585 --> 14:38.669
I know who you are.

14:40.588 --> 14:41.463
May I sit down?

14:42.423 --> 14:44.550
Just need two minutes
of your time, please?

14:46.468 --> 14:48.637
Two minutes. Starting now.

14:48.721 --> 14:49.722
Thank you.

14:50.681 --> 14:54.894
So I'm just… I'm trying to gather
some information about Lara Elliott.

14:55.769 --> 14:57.980
And you saw my name in the paper.

14:58.939 --> 15:00.232
Like I told the reporter,

15:00.316 --> 15:03.193
Lara and I were close back when
she worked at Chaos Games,

15:03.277 --> 15:04.695
but that was years ago.

15:06.739 --> 15:10.951
She was… such a brilliant coder.

15:11.911 --> 15:13.913
Can I ask you why you two lost touch?

15:14.914 --> 15:18.208
If I had to guess,
I'd say it was Trevor. He was controlling.

15:19.501 --> 15:21.378
I never knew what she saw in him.

15:21.462 --> 15:24.924
Her phone records indicate
she placed a call to your cell

15:25.007 --> 15:26.383
two days before the murder.

15:26.467 --> 15:27.343
Yes.

15:28.260 --> 15:30.930
She wanted to meet for lunch,
which I thought was odd,

15:31.013 --> 15:33.849
-given how long it's been.
-Mmm-hmm.

15:33.933 --> 15:36.393
But we never got the chance.

15:36.477 --> 15:38.479
Any idea what it was about?

15:38.562 --> 15:41.565
I figured maybe she was offering me a job.

15:41.649 --> 15:44.068
Parallax goes through
engineers like water.

15:45.444 --> 15:51.492
Sorry, but that's all I know.
And your two minutes is just about up.

15:51.575 --> 15:55.371
Is there anyone else from Lara's past
who might have wanted to hurt her?

15:55.454 --> 15:58.666
-How can you ask me that?
-Because I don't know who killed her.

15:58.749 --> 16:01.585
Neither do you.
Somebody has to be asking that question.

16:01.669 --> 16:03.420
If not the police, it has to be me.

16:03.504 --> 16:08.801
Everybody loved Lara.
Even Trevor, I suppose.

16:14.181 --> 16:17.017
Why was Lara calling Sonia
few days before her death?

16:17.101 --> 16:18.227
No idea.

16:18.310 --> 16:20.980
She said she might've
been calling to offer her a job.

16:21.063 --> 16:24.483
Not likely. Though, I'm sure Sonia
would love to think that were true.

16:24.566 --> 16:27.736
You know how many times she tried
to hit me up for a job over the years?

16:27.820 --> 16:29.279
Weren't she and Lara friends?

16:29.363 --> 16:32.658
Uh, years ago. Once Parallax
took off, everything changed.

16:32.741 --> 16:34.743
Why are you even asking about all this?

16:34.827 --> 16:38.622
I'm just covering our bases, Trevor.
If I found Sonia, Golantz will too.

16:38.706 --> 16:40.874
It's no secret,
she doesn't think much of me

16:40.958 --> 16:43.585
even though she'd cut
her right arm off to work here.

16:43.669 --> 16:46.463
But I can't imagine what she could say
that would mean anything.

16:47.214 --> 16:49.550
All right.
One more thing before I let you go.

16:49.633 --> 16:52.511
-It's about your original retainer.
-Yeah, what about it?

16:52.594 --> 16:55.305
My office manager has been
going over Jerry's books

16:55.389 --> 16:58.684
and there's a $100,000 payment
that's unaccounted for.

16:58.767 --> 17:00.477
<i>-Ring a bell?</i>
-No, should it?

17:00.561 --> 17:03.022
I don't know.
Jerry wasn't the best record keeper.

17:03.105 --> 17:06.316
<i>There were notes about</i>
<i>commissioning a video re-enactment</i>

17:06.400 --> 17:09.737
of the murders for the jury.
Did he say anything about that to you?

17:10.612 --> 17:13.657
Oh, that. You know what?
Now that you mention it.

17:13.741 --> 17:17.077
Yeah, he did.
He said it was gonna be expensive, but,

17:17.161 --> 17:19.788
yeah, I don't know
whatever happened with it.

17:20.789 --> 17:23.292
Yeah. Yeah, that's what I thought.

17:24.251 --> 17:25.919
And it just didn't happen, right?

17:27.504 --> 17:29.131
Okay, anything else?

17:29.965 --> 17:33.260
Just, uh, rest up. We have a big week.

17:33.343 --> 17:34.428
Yeah, I'll try.

17:52.446 --> 17:53.280
What's wrong?

17:55.115 --> 17:57.910
People are lying to me, Izzy. That's what.

19:36.884 --> 19:39.136
You wanna tell me
why we're doing this?

19:39.761 --> 19:40.596
Nope.

19:56.528 --> 19:59.364
Damn. Hell freeze over?

20:03.368 --> 20:06.330
-I know it's been a while, Jesús.
-Yeah, you could say that.

20:07.372 --> 20:12.127
Didn't think I'd ever see you again.
Not with all your rich clients now.

20:13.795 --> 20:16.298
We get the news in here when the TV works.

20:17.424 --> 20:20.469
That's not it. Not all of it, anyway.

20:22.971 --> 20:24.640
I was in an accident, Jesús.

20:24.723 --> 20:27.726
Man, save your fucking story
for someone who gives a shit.

20:27.809 --> 20:29.561
Couldn't blame you
for being angry.

20:31.438 --> 20:34.524
-I'm sorry you're in--
-Spare me the guilty conscience, too.

20:35.108 --> 20:37.027
Amá really thought we could trust you.

20:37.986 --> 20:40.948
He is one of us,
he speaks Spanish.

20:43.075 --> 20:44.326
Joke's on us.

20:46.161 --> 20:48.038
You pled me out as fast as you could.

20:48.121 --> 20:51.166
You had to take that plea
because our star witness went missing.

20:51.250 --> 20:53.335
I promise you, I'm gonna find her.

20:53.418 --> 20:55.087
I've got somebody looking for her.

20:55.170 --> 20:56.338
-And?
-And when I find her,

20:56.421 --> 21:00.342
I'm gonna convince her to cooperate.
Then I'm gonna file for a habeas petition.

21:00.425 --> 21:03.011
-That's a legal motion--
-I know what it is.

21:03.095 --> 21:07.099
In between solitary and getting shanked,
I've been hitting law books in here.

21:08.225 --> 21:10.394
All the better to know,
I ain't got no shot.

21:10.477 --> 21:15.065
Jesús, you've got one shot and I'm not
gonna rest until you get it. All right?

21:17.818 --> 21:21.655
So, my freedom
lies on that lady's word, if you find her?

21:21.738 --> 21:23.573
And if she wants to talk?

21:26.952 --> 21:28.287
Man, why do you even care?

21:30.122 --> 21:31.498
Why are you even here?

21:33.542 --> 21:36.712
I'm here because
I believe you're innocent, Jesús.

21:36.795 --> 21:37.963
I always believed that.

21:38.046 --> 21:41.425
We just couldn't win.
But I told you, when you took that plea,

21:41.508 --> 21:43.927
I told you
I wouldn't stop fighting for you.

21:44.011 --> 21:47.306
I had a setback and I'm sorry for that
but I'm a man of my word.

21:47.389 --> 21:49.641
If nothing else, I'm that.

21:53.770 --> 21:54.980
Give me a second chance.

21:59.943 --> 22:02.571
And this area
can accommodate up to a hundred guests.

22:02.654 --> 22:05.532
Have you decided on
a seated dinner or heavy hors d'oeuvres?

22:05.615 --> 22:07.951
-Seated dinner.
-What's heavy hors d'oeuvres.

22:08.035 --> 22:09.953
We were hoping to see the menu first.

22:10.037 --> 22:12.414
Of course. Have you eaten here before?

22:12.497 --> 22:15.834
We have, but I think
it was called something different.

22:16.710 --> 22:19.463
Is that same chef still here?
What did we have?

22:19.546 --> 22:21.089
We really liked the, uh…

22:21.173 --> 22:23.425
Deconstructed beef Wellington
with shellfish lollipops.

22:23.508 --> 22:26.511
The surf and turf. Chef Casal
is still here. He's one of the owners.

22:26.595 --> 22:31.683
Oh, I didn't know. You guys have done
quite a renovation. Looks expensive.

22:32.559 --> 22:34.436
The dance floor would be in the back room.

22:34.519 --> 22:37.397
You'll be the first wedding
since we installed the bamboo flooring.

22:37.481 --> 22:40.567
-Ah. How much was that?
-I have no idea.

22:40.650 --> 22:44.196
Look, we just want to make sure
this place is solid. Okay?

22:44.279 --> 22:47.657
Last thing we need
is to book it for our special day

22:47.741 --> 22:49.618
and then have you guys shut down again.

22:52.245 --> 22:53.246
You feel me?

22:53.330 --> 22:58.335
Uh… of course. Truth is, we weren't sure
we'd reopen once the restaurant shut down,

22:58.418 --> 23:02.631
but Chef Casal and his husband James
worked their magic and <i>voilà.</i>

23:02.714 --> 23:03.924
Ah.

23:04.007 --> 23:07.344
-Good thing they found their magic.
-Can I show you our back patio?

23:07.427 --> 23:09.721
-We just installed a succulent wall.

23:09.805 --> 23:10.722
Rock and roll.

23:20.649 --> 23:23.151
The guy you went to see,
was he your client?

23:26.947 --> 23:29.741
Yeah, the one I told you about.

23:32.911 --> 23:33.787
Oh.

23:34.830 --> 23:35.789
Damn.

23:39.126 --> 23:42.337
You asked me
what my trigger was, what got me using?

23:44.256 --> 23:47.717
Pain I was killing
wasn't from the accident. Not really.

23:49.928 --> 23:50.971
It was him.

23:53.056 --> 23:55.392
When he got sentenced, I just…

23:55.475 --> 23:56.852
I just shut down…

23:58.145 --> 23:59.396
Pills helped me do it.

24:04.484 --> 24:05.944
I gotta get him out, Izzy.

24:24.838 --> 24:28.175
So, now I'm gonna take
this meeting outside, all right?

24:43.190 --> 24:45.901
-Mr. Haller?
-Hi, it's Mickey.

24:46.776 --> 24:50.530
I hope you don't mind meeting here.
It's just, wanted somewhere private.

24:51.281 --> 24:55.535
The prosecutor, she said I should
talk to a lawyer I could trust.

24:55.619 --> 25:00.957
She did, but I wanna make one thing clear.
I work for you and only you. Okay?

25:01.041 --> 25:03.210
Whatever you say, stays between us.

25:03.293 --> 25:07.297
It's just, she said that I'd go to jail,
that I would lose my baby.

25:09.090 --> 25:10.300
What are you having?

25:11.468 --> 25:12.469
A girl.

25:13.136 --> 25:14.304
I have a daughter too.

25:15.597 --> 25:18.517
I promise you,
I will do anything that's in my power

25:18.600 --> 25:21.019
to keep you and your baby safe. All right?

25:21.937 --> 25:24.022
So, how did you meet Angelo Soto?

25:24.105 --> 25:25.065
I worked for him.

25:25.815 --> 25:28.068
I started like the others
at the nursing home.

25:28.151 --> 25:31.154
-What happened next?
-He noticed me.

25:31.905 --> 25:34.616
Started bringing me lunch,
treating me special.

25:35.325 --> 25:37.410
Soon he wanted me to be his girlfriend.

25:38.703 --> 25:40.372
I never loved him.

25:41.248 --> 25:45.544
But he got me an apartment, money.

25:47.754 --> 25:51.299
Mr. Soto is charged with human trafficking
and slave labor.

25:52.133 --> 25:55.262
-Do you know anything about that?
-He doesn't tell me anything.

25:56.012 --> 26:00.225
If I ask him questions,
he gets angry. But I see things.

26:00.308 --> 26:03.478
I want you to write it down,
as best as you remember.

26:03.562 --> 26:06.106
Names, dates, everything. Can you do that?

26:07.399 --> 26:09.943
Now the charges
the prosecutor threatened you with,

26:10.026 --> 26:12.571
your name being
on the bank records, don't worry.

26:12.654 --> 26:16.241
I can handle that. You don't have to
cooperate if you don't want to.

26:16.908 --> 26:20.954
I want to get away from him.
I want a new start for my daughter.

26:22.455 --> 26:25.041
I don't want her
growing up with him as a father.

26:25.125 --> 26:28.628
And that's what you'll get.
I'll talk to the prosecutor.

26:30.297 --> 26:31.673
You're nicer than her.

26:32.674 --> 26:35.302
She's actually a sweetheart
once you get to know her.

26:45.645 --> 26:48.815
He's at table 11. Want to talk
to him, let him speak to you later.

26:48.898 --> 26:50.108
So, five minutes?

26:50.191 --> 26:51.192
-Yes.
-Okay.

26:51.276 --> 26:53.153
You know I won't forget your support.

26:56.364 --> 26:58.366
You remember your 30th birthday?

26:59.784 --> 27:01.369
You brought me here for dinner.

27:02.454 --> 27:04.706
It was quite expensive, as I recall.

27:04.789 --> 27:07.959
You always did know
how to put on a show, Haller.

27:08.043 --> 27:11.588
-So, I met with Tanya Cruz.
-She gonna cooperate?

27:11.671 --> 27:14.007
Putting aside that you threatened
to take her baby away

27:14.090 --> 27:15.550
on charges that wouldn't hold up…

27:15.634 --> 27:17.469
Soto killed my witness, Mickey.

27:17.552 --> 27:21.473
Which is why you'll appreciate my client's
fear for her baby's future, Mag.

27:23.016 --> 27:23.892
What do you want?

27:23.975 --> 27:27.520
Relocation, financial support
for a year, minimum.

27:27.604 --> 27:30.023
I can relocate her
through the trial, but a year?

27:30.106 --> 27:34.277
-I don't have the authority to do that.
-Maybe not you, but I know who does.

27:38.490 --> 27:41.159
Let's talk about this later.
I gotta go do my job now.

27:41.951 --> 27:45.705
This is your job now?
See, maybe you should run for office.

27:45.789 --> 27:46.831
Yeah, right.

27:49.834 --> 27:50.710
Haller?

27:51.378 --> 27:54.047
I saw you walk in,
thought I'd come say hello.

27:54.130 --> 27:57.967
-Didn't want it to be weird.
-Yeah, well, this isn't usually my scene.

27:58.051 --> 27:59.010
That's all.

27:59.636 --> 28:00.845
I get it.

28:02.305 --> 28:05.016
No, I meant, I don't have a boss
I have to suck up to.

28:06.685 --> 28:08.770
Good evening.

28:08.853 --> 28:11.064
Good evening,
and thank you for being here.

28:11.147 --> 28:13.566
My name is Maggie McPherson.

28:13.650 --> 28:17.112
For the past nine years,
I've been a deputy DA in Major Crimes

28:17.195 --> 28:19.656
under the person
who you came here to see tonight,

28:19.739 --> 28:23.702
which gives me a pretty good platform
to talk smack about her, I think.

28:24.411 --> 28:27.789
She does that when she's nervous,
doesn't she? The hair thing.

28:27.872 --> 28:31.126
I mean, you know better than me.
You were married to her.

28:31.209 --> 28:32.127
I just…

28:32.711 --> 28:35.296
…she's deeply familiar
with the needs of our office…

28:35.380 --> 28:37.382
Anyway, I gotta go. Get my beauty rest.

28:37.465 --> 28:39.426
Got a big day Monday. Cheers.

28:39.509 --> 28:41.845
…and most importantly,
she is fair.

28:41.928 --> 28:44.931
Ladies and gentlemen,
in this historic space,

28:45.014 --> 28:50.645
it's my great honor to introduce the next
District Attorney of Los Angeles County,

28:50.729 --> 28:52.397
Janelle Simmons.

28:56.901 --> 28:59.821
Thank you, Maggie.
And thank you, everyone, for coming…

28:59.904 --> 29:01.740
-Hey, Tony.
-Hey, there he is.

29:01.823 --> 29:04.659
-How are you, man?
-Thanks for the invite, Mick.

29:04.743 --> 29:06.119
You're the one doing me a favor.

29:06.202 --> 29:07.495
Ah! Speaking of which…

29:09.456 --> 29:11.666
It's the internal audit
from the crime lab.

29:11.750 --> 29:15.086
They copied it in my discovery
by mistake. Hope it helps you out.

29:15.170 --> 29:18.423
-This is just what I needed. Thank you.
-My pleasure. Listen.

29:18.506 --> 29:21.134
-Show 'em how solo guys do it.
-Enjoy yourself.

29:21.217 --> 29:24.471
…many of you, like Maggie,
are veterans of the district…

29:25.805 --> 29:26.639
Maggie?

29:27.182 --> 29:29.934
Lorna, hey. I didn't know
you were gonna be here.

29:30.602 --> 29:31.519
I can leave.

29:31.603 --> 29:36.065
No, it's fine.
I just needed some air, I guess.

29:36.149 --> 29:38.735
These things are an acquired taste
which I've never acquired.

29:40.612 --> 29:41.946
No Cisco tonight?

29:42.030 --> 29:44.491
No, no.
It's not really his cup of tea.

29:44.574 --> 29:48.411
It's not really mine either, but I just
wanted an excuse to wear this dress.

29:51.873 --> 29:54.167
-How's Hayley?
-Why?

29:55.376 --> 29:56.961
Mickey mentioned an incident.

29:58.505 --> 29:59.756
Oh! Um…

30:00.298 --> 30:04.886
Yeah. She's gonna be fine, Lorna.
At least, I think she will be.

30:05.512 --> 30:08.807
Well, I'm sure she will be.
I could come by sometime.

30:08.890 --> 30:11.100
Maybe bring her a care package?

30:11.184 --> 30:13.520
She used to love
these cookies we would make.

30:13.603 --> 30:15.355
Yeah, maybe.

30:19.484 --> 30:23.571
-I didn't mean to pry.
-No, it's okay. It's just…

30:24.489 --> 30:27.325
She's gonna need some time. That's all.

30:29.369 --> 30:33.873
Okay. I should probably head back in.
I didn't eat any dinner.

30:33.957 --> 30:35.917
The mushroom caps are gonna have to do.

30:38.169 --> 30:40.421
-Hey, Lorna.
-Yeah?

30:40.505 --> 30:45.051
-Nice shoes.
-Oh. Thank you. They're Dior.

30:45.134 --> 30:46.219
On sale.

30:50.932 --> 30:53.852
-Hey.
-Hey.

30:53.935 --> 30:55.270
You leaving?

30:55.353 --> 30:57.647
I need to get home before my ride
turns into a pumpkin.

30:57.730 --> 30:59.566
I'll talk to Janelle in the morning.

30:59.649 --> 31:01.442
-All right.
-She's preoccupied right now.

31:01.526 --> 31:05.697
And Cabernet and negotiating
don't always mix. So…

31:05.780 --> 31:09.242
You want a ride home?
I mean, I'm the sober one. Remember?

31:09.325 --> 31:11.953
No, I'm okay. I called an Uber.
So, I'm fine.

31:13.955 --> 31:18.835
So, uh, this guy, Golantz… Did you, uh…

31:20.378 --> 31:22.505
-What?
-No, it's fine if you did.

31:22.589 --> 31:25.008
It just would have been nice
to get a heads-up.

31:25.091 --> 31:30.013
We had drinks twice after work.
It was more professional than anything.

31:30.096 --> 31:32.015
Not that it's your business.

31:32.974 --> 31:34.350
No, it's not.

31:34.434 --> 31:35.685
What's gotten into you?

31:35.768 --> 31:38.563
You can't tell when a DA is trying
to play mind games with you?

31:40.023 --> 31:42.233
I mean, seriously.

31:42.901 --> 31:45.695
Should I come by tomorrow
to finalize the deal?

31:46.571 --> 31:49.073
Maybe have breakfast
with Hayley, if she'll see me.

31:49.157 --> 31:51.993
Let the pancakes
do most of the talking, that works for me.

31:52.076 --> 31:54.495
-All right.
-Thanks for coming, Mickey.

31:54.579 --> 31:58.333
Have a good night, Mags. Thanks.

32:15.725 --> 32:19.437
-Maggie.
-Bob. What are you doing here?

32:20.647 --> 32:23.441
-I came to talk to you, actually.
-Me?

32:24.192 --> 32:27.946
I understand you're loyal to Janelle
and loyalty is important,

32:28.029 --> 32:30.239
but it can also be taken too far.

32:31.032 --> 32:35.578
You know Janelle. First DA,
then City Hall, then who knows what?

32:35.662 --> 32:37.330
She's already lining up her next job.

32:38.414 --> 32:39.874
And you aren't?

32:39.958 --> 32:41.751
You really think Janelle has your back?

32:42.669 --> 32:44.837
You and every other DA in that office?

32:44.921 --> 32:48.341
I don't get involved in politics.
I just do my job.

32:48.424 --> 32:51.052
I know. That's why you need a boss

32:51.135 --> 32:54.764
who'll give you the tools
and the freedom to do it well.

32:56.182 --> 32:57.850
Just think about it. That's all.

32:59.060 --> 33:00.395
Have a good night, Maggie.

33:14.450 --> 33:16.661
<i>Looks like</i>
<i>the Judge is a dead end.</i>

33:16.744 --> 33:18.204
<i>I thought he was good for it,</i>

33:18.287 --> 33:20.581
but turns out the mortgage
on that building

33:20.665 --> 33:22.333
is owned by a family trust.

33:22.417 --> 33:26.045
<i>They took out a second around the time</i>
<i>of the restaurant renovation.</i>

33:26.129 --> 33:27.714
So, it's legit.

33:27.797 --> 33:30.216
So, the money didn't come from a bribe.

33:30.299 --> 33:33.011
-Back to square one.
-<i>Listen, Mick, one more thing.</i>

33:33.094 --> 33:37.015
I saw you were going to meet
with the Hard Case Casey.

33:37.098 --> 33:41.019
He got a parole violation,
and Teddy asked me if I could handle it.

33:41.102 --> 33:44.689
-You saw Teddy?
-<i>He saw me, more like it.</i>

33:44.772 --> 33:48.192
Look, Cisco, the Saints
have been clients for years. All right?

33:49.360 --> 33:52.572
You gotta do what you got to do, Mick.
I'm gonna get going.

34:01.122 --> 34:06.127
I talked to Janelle.
Two months relocation, best we can offer.

34:06.210 --> 34:09.547
Come on, Maggie. She's an immigrant.
She doesn't know anyone here.

34:09.630 --> 34:12.091
-That's not enough.
-We're not the Feds, Mick.

34:12.175 --> 34:13.801
We don't have WITSEC.

34:13.885 --> 34:15.636
I'm sorry, did you ask me to do this

34:15.720 --> 34:17.430
because you thought
I'd talk Tanya into it?

34:17.513 --> 34:20.433
-Take a dive for you, is that it?
-I asked because I trust you.

34:22.310 --> 34:24.020
Does the name Letty Lopez mean anything?

34:24.103 --> 34:25.188
No. Should it?

34:25.271 --> 34:27.565
She's been living in Reno
for seven years now,

34:27.648 --> 34:29.650
waiting to testify in this drug case.

34:29.734 --> 34:31.736
And during that time, we, the taxpayers,

34:31.819 --> 34:35.573
have provided her with $2,000 a month
in rent and expenses.

34:35.656 --> 34:37.200
Ask Janelle. You know what?

34:37.283 --> 34:40.036
Better yet,
ask your friend, Detective Lankford.

34:40.119 --> 34:42.455
If you don't
have the money, Maggie, LAPD does.

34:42.538 --> 34:45.249
It comes out of their
ten billion dollar annual budget.

34:45.333 --> 34:47.502
That'll get slashed
once they defund the police.

34:47.585 --> 34:49.128
All I'm asking is one year.

34:49.212 --> 34:52.799
So this woman can have a fresh start
after risking her life for you.

34:52.882 --> 34:54.759
That's the deal. Take it or leave it.

34:56.594 --> 34:58.471
Okay. I'll push Janelle.

34:59.889 --> 35:02.183
Can't you guys be like normal parents?

35:03.851 --> 35:05.269
Are you ready? I'm starving.

35:05.353 --> 35:07.563
-Okay. Then let's go.
<i>-Vámonos.</i>

35:07.647 --> 35:09.357
-Bye, Mom.
-Have fun.

35:12.485 --> 35:15.863
Were you and Mom,
like, on a date last night?

35:15.947 --> 35:21.244
What? No, it was a thing
for your mom's boss.

35:22.120 --> 35:23.871
Why would you think it was a date?

35:23.955 --> 35:28.751
I don't know. The other night I saw
you guys together after Mom's…

35:29.710 --> 35:33.714
-After what happened.
-Yeah, you saw that, huh?

35:34.715 --> 35:38.594
Look, Hayley, I still care for your mom.

35:38.678 --> 35:41.139
I always will, all right? I just…

35:42.056 --> 35:44.851
I don't know
what the future holds, you know?

35:46.102 --> 35:49.564
I figured.
I mean, you're both so different.

35:50.481 --> 35:54.026
Why, because I represent killers
and she puts them away?

35:55.570 --> 35:59.824
You know what?
Forget pancakes. I've got a better idea.

36:10.168 --> 36:13.045
So, you brought me here for the fountains?

36:13.129 --> 36:14.839
Seen these a million times.

36:14.922 --> 36:17.008
No, not the fountain. Look.

36:18.593 --> 36:20.219
-You see that building?
-Mmm-hmm.

36:20.303 --> 36:21.637
That's City Hall.

36:21.721 --> 36:25.224
One next to it, the Hall of Justice
where your mother works.

36:25.308 --> 36:28.769
Right in front, that one,
it's the Federal Courthouse.

36:28.853 --> 36:31.147
This one is FBI and ICE.

36:32.565 --> 36:37.904
This is LAPD.
Now, you see that man over there?

36:37.987 --> 36:38.821
Yeah.

36:38.905 --> 36:41.324
He probably
doesn't have a permit for his cart.

36:41.407 --> 36:44.535
May be undocumented.
That's not a crime, exactly,

36:44.619 --> 36:47.330
but people are going
to still come looking for you.

36:47.413 --> 36:49.498
Now, what is he supposed to do

36:49.582 --> 36:52.168
against all these people
in all these big buildings?

36:53.211 --> 36:57.924
Okay. I get all that.
But Trevor Elliott's not an underdog.

36:58.007 --> 37:00.801
No, he's not,
but the principle is the same.

37:00.885 --> 37:04.180
I represent underdogs, too.
So did your grandfather.

37:04.263 --> 37:08.893
I thought most of his clients were,
like, rock stars and drug dealers.

37:08.976 --> 37:11.938
No, not always. I remember one case.

37:12.021 --> 37:14.440
Your <i>abuela</i> brought me
to watch and it was, uh…

37:14.523 --> 37:17.109
it was this kid
accused in a drive-by or something,

37:17.193 --> 37:20.863
and the whole case was a sham.
He was 100% innocent.

37:20.947 --> 37:23.324
But to them, didn't matter.

37:24.367 --> 37:26.118
You ever have somebody like that?

37:26.202 --> 37:29.830
As a matter of fact, yes.
But I'm back. I'm gonna try to help him.

37:30.748 --> 37:35.127
Okay, so, why don't you work
on that case instead of Trevor Elliott?

37:36.003 --> 37:38.089
It's just not that simple, Hayley.

37:38.172 --> 37:40.925
I have a trial
and I have a duty to my client.

37:41.717 --> 37:46.722
Well, yeah, but you just got the case.
Why does it have to be right now?

37:47.473 --> 37:51.143
Because my client doesn't want
a delay and he wants his day in court.

37:52.812 --> 37:56.983
I don't get it.
If I were looking at going to jail,

37:57.066 --> 37:59.694
I'd put that shit off as long as I could.

38:00.486 --> 38:01.737
Sorry.

38:04.573 --> 38:07.368
-Dad?
-Come on. Gotta take you home.

38:07.994 --> 38:09.370
Come on. Let's go.

38:20.089 --> 38:22.591
What's so urgent,
it couldn't wait till morning?

38:22.675 --> 38:24.927
-How did you do it?
-Do what?

38:25.011 --> 38:28.639
How'd you bribe a juror
months before there's even a jury panel?

38:31.309 --> 38:33.185
What the hell are you talking about?

38:33.269 --> 38:36.814
You refused to take a continuance
because you had to go to trial right away.

38:36.897 --> 38:39.900
-I told you. My company is--
-Bullshit.

38:39.984 --> 38:42.987
Nobody gambles their freedom
on a business deal, Trevor.

38:43.738 --> 38:47.074
Jury summonses go out
for a specific date. So, you knew.

38:47.158 --> 38:50.202
You knew if you could get
a potential juror on your panel,

38:50.286 --> 38:51.495
you might pull this off.

38:51.579 --> 38:53.622
That's why you didn't want
a jury consultant.

38:53.706 --> 38:56.542
It's why you demanded
final say on the jurors

38:56.625 --> 39:00.379
and that stunt you pulled in the garage
to get that juror kicked off,

39:00.463 --> 39:01.839
you planted somebody.

39:03.716 --> 39:05.593
I'm an aerospace engineer
at Lockheed Martin.

39:05.676 --> 39:07.762
I'm single and I live in Palos Verdes.

39:07.845 --> 39:09.638
It's juror number seven, isn't it?

39:13.934 --> 39:16.479
I don't know who the guy is
or anything about him.

39:16.562 --> 39:18.522
All I know is he's bought and paid for.

39:19.565 --> 39:23.402
Yeah, well, that's it.
I draw the line at clients who pay bribes.

39:23.486 --> 39:25.696
-What're you saying?
-I'm saying, I'm out.

39:25.780 --> 39:27.823
You say I need this? Well, not this badly.

39:27.907 --> 39:29.909
-No. You can't do that.
-Well, try me.

39:29.992 --> 39:31.619
You don't understand. You can't do that.

39:31.702 --> 39:34.914
-It'll be the end for both of us.
-What are you talking about?

39:36.999 --> 39:41.212
I'm not the one that paid the bribe.
You understand what I'm saying?

39:42.713 --> 39:45.466
It was Jerry. I don't know how.

39:45.549 --> 39:47.885
He set it up
through his investigator. Carlin.

39:47.968 --> 39:49.220
There's a problem with that.

39:49.303 --> 39:52.181
Jerry was gonna ask
for a continuance. I found the motion.

39:52.264 --> 39:54.975
I know. That's why you can't withdraw.

40:00.439 --> 40:02.233
That's what I'm trying
to fucking tell you.

40:02.316 --> 40:05.820
What? You're saying they're connected?
Jerry's murder with the Elliott case?

40:06.904 --> 40:09.824
That's what got him killed, isn't it?

40:10.908 --> 40:12.618
-Did you kill him, Trevor?

40:12.701 --> 40:16.122
I told you. I don't kill people.
I don't do that.

40:16.205 --> 40:19.333
I didn't lie to you, Mickey.
Not about the important thing.

40:20.334 --> 40:26.841
I didn't kill Jerry, and God knows,
I didn't kill Lara, or fucking Jan Rilz.

40:26.924 --> 40:28.467
Then who the fuck did?

40:28.551 --> 40:31.303
I asked you once before,
where do you think I got the money?

40:31.387 --> 40:32.263
What?

40:32.346 --> 40:35.099
It takes millions to launch
a company like mine, Mickey.

40:35.182 --> 40:37.685
-I didn't have a nickel.
-I thought you had investors.

40:37.768 --> 40:39.019
Not the kind you're thinking.

40:39.103 --> 40:41.147
Those VC guys
wouldn't give me the time of day.

40:41.230 --> 40:44.817
They didn't have the vision
or the balls, but…

40:46.277 --> 40:49.447
I had a roommate in college
named Pavel Kosevich.

40:49.530 --> 40:50.364
-I know.

40:50.448 --> 40:53.826
His father's name is Sergei Kosevich.
Does that ring a bell?

40:53.909 --> 40:55.995
-You ever heard of him?
-Yeah, some billionaire.

40:56.078 --> 40:58.747
-Owns a soccer team.
-Yeah. He owns a soccer team.

40:58.831 --> 41:03.752
He also happens to be in control of
the largest oil and gas company in Russia

41:03.836 --> 41:05.880
along with tons of other stuff.

41:05.963 --> 41:11.427
Man, I was desperate and stupid,
and Kosevich cut himself a sweetheart deal

41:11.510 --> 41:13.012
that is about to pay off.

41:14.430 --> 41:16.682
And this is not a man
you fuck with, Mickey.

41:17.433 --> 41:20.769
He doesn't let anything
stand in his way. Not Jerry. Not Lara.

41:20.853 --> 41:22.229
What did Lara have to do with it?

41:22.313 --> 41:25.483
Man, our marriage was falling apart.
I was basically living at the office.

41:25.566 --> 41:26.692
She was gonna leave me.

41:26.775 --> 41:29.653
And when Kosevich found out
about the divorce, he knew…

41:31.906 --> 41:36.744
We didn't have a prenup.
So, she leaves, she takes half the money.

41:37.703 --> 41:38.996
It wasn't my money.

41:41.874 --> 41:44.668
I begged her to call it off.

41:46.670 --> 41:50.382
That morning, I went out to the house
to try to get her out of there but…

41:53.928 --> 41:57.765
That's why they're following me.
That's why my car is bugged.

42:00.059 --> 42:04.647
Trust me, your car being bugged
is the least of your worries.

42:04.730 --> 42:07.775
They need my company's
acquisition to go through.

42:07.858 --> 42:10.361
If I get convicted, that doesn't happen.

42:10.444 --> 42:13.239
They'll kill me, too,
if I'm no use to him anymore.

42:13.322 --> 42:14.990
If I breathe a word of this,

42:15.074 --> 42:17.993
they'll tie up every loose end
they have to. Do you understand?

42:19.078 --> 42:21.872
That means you, your family…

42:28.003 --> 42:30.256
Mickey, I told you I was innocent.

42:31.674 --> 42:32.883
You believe me now?

42:38.264 --> 42:41.225
I believe you didn't do
what they charged you with, Trevor.

42:44.687 --> 42:46.105
It's enough for me.

42:47.940 --> 42:49.108
So, will you help me?

42:51.277 --> 42:52.486
Please.

43:36.113 --> 43:38.991
You said this case is one
of the hardest ones you ever had, right?

43:39.700 --> 43:40.701
That's right.

43:41.327 --> 43:44.371
But if the man didn't do it,
isn't that a good thing?

43:45.122 --> 43:46.248
Only if you win.

43:47.082 --> 43:50.544
If somebody's guilty,
I'm gonna do my best to represent them.

43:50.628 --> 43:53.547
Just like I would anybody. That's my job.

43:54.590 --> 43:57.426
But if they go to jail,
I can live with that.

43:58.135 --> 43:59.970
Well, after all, they did it, right?

44:01.221 --> 44:04.850
But do you know what it's like
to represent somebody you know is innocent

44:04.933 --> 44:06.727
and you can't save them?

44:07.936 --> 44:10.272
I'll take the guilty client any day.

44:10.356 --> 44:12.191
I sleep better that way.

44:16.570 --> 44:19.031
The Gods of Guilt have spoken.

44:19.114 --> 44:21.408
Gotta go, kiddo. The jury's back.
