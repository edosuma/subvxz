WEBVTT

00:04.874 --> 00:06.571
All right, Caroline,

00:06.615 --> 00:09.313
we'll have your infusion ready
in just a minute.

00:09.357 --> 00:11.011
If you feel nauseous
just let us know

00:11.054 --> 00:12.664
and we'll get you some Zofran.

00:12.708 --> 00:14.231
Okay.

00:14.275 --> 00:15.687
Think maybe we could just
give her some preemptively?

00:15.711 --> 00:18.322
Sheshe got nauseous
the first three infusions.

00:18.366 --> 00:19.584
I'm fine.

00:19.628 --> 00:22.413
Danny, I can ask
for my own meds, thank you.

00:22.457 --> 00:24.633
Of course you can,
I'm justl'm just trying to...

00:24.676 --> 00:26.809
Wait, wait a second.

00:26.852 --> 00:28.158
Don't start the infusion yet.

00:28.202 --> 00:30.421
Heather? Heather, sorry.

00:30.465 --> 00:32.293
Um, I'm just curious,

00:32.336 --> 00:35.905
is nausea a side-effect
of the drug?

00:35.948 --> 00:37.167
No, itit's an effect

00:37.211 --> 00:39.517
of the infusion process
in general.

00:39.561 --> 00:41.519
Well, what kind
of side effects are you seeing

00:41.563 --> 00:43.260
from patients who are getting
thethe drug

00:43.304 --> 00:45.741
as opposed to those
who are getting the placebo?

00:45.784 --> 00:47.351
This is a blinded trial.

00:47.395 --> 00:49.112
You know I can't disclose
that kind of information.

00:49.136 --> 00:50.200
Of course, of course you can't.

00:50.224 --> 00:51.834
I mean, not that I'd
ever tell her.

00:51.877 --> 00:54.880
I just wanna be able to manage
her expectations, that's all.

00:54.924 --> 00:57.100
Dan, I'm not gonna tell you

00:57.144 --> 00:59.885
whether she's on drug
or placebo.

01:05.717 --> 01:08.198
What are you doing?

01:08.242 --> 01:10.157
Trying to take care
of my wifemy ex-wife.

01:10.200 --> 01:12.550
I know that you're worried
about Cece,

01:12.594 --> 01:15.292
but this is exactly
what got you into trouble

01:15.336 --> 01:16.902
when you were married.

01:16.946 --> 01:20.732
Okay, look, I'm just gonna go
get her a glass of water.

01:24.736 --> 01:25.911
Hey, we got a patient in 2.

01:25.955 --> 01:28.131
Cystic fibrosis, temp 103.

01:28.175 --> 01:30.394
Third time he's been in
the last month.

01:30.438 --> 01:33.093
That doesn't sound good.

01:36.618 --> 01:39.403
Here.

01:39.447 --> 01:41.971
Been meaning
to give you that back.

01:43.755 --> 01:45.888
Hi, Ben, I'm Dr. Halstead.

01:45.931 --> 01:48.151
- This is Dr. Manning.
- Hi.

01:48.195 --> 01:49.152
How long have you had the fever?

01:49.196 --> 01:50.936
Started last night.

01:50.980 --> 01:52.566
Do you know what antibiotics
usually work for you?

01:52.590 --> 01:54.114
Not many.

01:54.157 --> 01:56.333
The last few times
they went straight to Imipenem.

01:56.377 --> 01:58.422
Okay.

01:58.466 --> 02:00.468
500 of Imipenem, CBC,
BMP, cultures times three,

02:00.511 --> 02:03.123
chest x-ray, PA, and a lateral.

02:03.166 --> 02:04.515
I'm sorry, one second.

02:04.559 --> 02:05.734
That's okay.

02:09.172 --> 02:10.347
Hey.

02:10.390 --> 02:12.480
I just parked.

02:12.523 --> 02:15.135
I'm walking. I love you.

02:15.178 --> 02:17.746
I love you, too.

02:17.789 --> 02:19.139
- It's my girlfriend.
- Aww.

02:19.182 --> 02:21.271
Lisa.

02:23.839 --> 02:25.145
She can come in if she wants.

02:25.188 --> 02:27.059
Actually, she can't.

02:27.103 --> 02:29.279
Um, she has cystic fibrosis too.

02:29.323 --> 02:31.586
Well, CF isn't contagious.

02:31.629 --> 02:34.110
But CF patients carry
many different strains

02:34.154 --> 02:35.372
of drug-resistant bacteria.

02:35.416 --> 02:37.331
The fear is that by sharing
the same air,

02:37.374 --> 02:40.464
they'll cross-infect each other.

02:40.508 --> 02:43.032
So you've never been
in the same room?

02:43.075 --> 02:45.556
We met in
an online support group.

02:45.600 --> 02:47.993
Lots of video chatting.

02:48.037 --> 02:50.779
Um, but that's all gonna change
once we each get new lungs.

02:50.822 --> 02:53.825
You have to tell them
you're status 1A.

02:53.869 --> 02:56.176
I'm status 1A.

02:56.219 --> 02:58.395
This is why she makes me
bring her everywhere.

02:58.439 --> 03:00.615
Glad to hear you're 1A.

03:00.658 --> 03:02.225
Three severe infections
in a month,

03:02.269 --> 03:04.072
you're gonna need those lungs
sooner than later.

03:04.096 --> 03:05.446
All right, well, I'll call over

03:05.489 --> 03:07.491
to the transplant coordinator,
and in the meantime

03:07.535 --> 03:11.408
hopefully the antibiotics will
help get your fever down, okay?

03:16.283 --> 03:17.501
Poor kids.

03:17.545 --> 03:20.200
So in love and they can't even
be together.

03:24.595 --> 03:26.989
April, are you taking
Mr. Lane in 6?

03:27.032 --> 03:28.295
- Going now.
- Awesome.

03:28.338 --> 03:29.600
- Don?
- Yeah?

03:29.644 --> 03:31.515
I have some stretchers
in the ambo bay.

03:31.559 --> 03:33.014
Can you take care of that?
Yeah, I'll get them.

03:33.038 --> 03:34.692
Thank you so much.

03:34.736 --> 03:35.780
- Hey.
- Hey.

03:35.824 --> 03:36.868
Hey, Ava.

03:36.912 --> 03:38.348
Robin.

03:38.392 --> 03:39.804
So, I heard you rounded
on my mom this morning.

03:39.828 --> 03:42.309
How's her new valve doing?
She is looking great.

03:42.352 --> 03:44.572
I don't foresee any problems.
Good.

03:44.615 --> 03:47.227
And did you see
the vertical farming exhibit

03:47.270 --> 03:49.054
at the Smart I told you about?

03:49.098 --> 03:52.362
I'm telling you,
the future is aeroponics.

03:52.406 --> 03:54.495
We get 120 days of rain a year.

03:54.538 --> 03:55.907
I don't see us running out
of water.

03:55.931 --> 03:57.367
It's not about the water.

03:57.411 --> 04:00.283
It's about feeding
130 million new babies a year.

04:00.327 --> 04:01.589
- Okay.
- Have you seen it?

04:01.632 --> 04:03.286
No, but...
But I'll make a point to.

04:03.330 --> 04:04.505
Thank you.

04:04.548 --> 04:07.899
Obviously, it is over
some people's heads.

04:07.943 --> 04:10.380
That's a vertical farming joke.

04:10.424 --> 04:11.555
- No.
- Yeah.

04:11.599 --> 04:13.905
Nope, nope, nope.

04:13.949 --> 04:16.298
Anyway, I know my mom's
scheduled for an echo tomorrow,

04:16.343 --> 04:18.040
so once you get the results...

04:21.957 --> 04:24.264
My God, help me!

04:29.965 --> 04:34.099
Please, help me! Get me out!

04:36.000 --> 04:42.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:44.762 --> 04:47.156
Help!

04:47.199 --> 04:49.941
Hey, hey, hey, don't move!
April, give me a hand!

04:49.985 --> 04:51.354
- Robin, go call Goodwin!
- Sir, sir?

04:51.378 --> 04:53.858
Can you hear me, sir?

04:53.902 --> 04:55.773
It's locked!

04:55.817 --> 04:57.297
I got an idea!

04:57.340 --> 04:59.342
- Don!
- Don?

04:59.386 --> 05:01.823
Hang on, Don!

05:01.866 --> 05:04.869
- Use this!
- Clear!

05:04.913 --> 05:07.437
I'll go call CFD!

05:10.353 --> 05:12.137
Kill the engine. Stay with him!

05:12.181 --> 05:15.315
Got it.

05:15.358 --> 05:18.143
- What do we got?
- Hey, hey.

05:18.187 --> 05:20.121
It's okay, we got you.
What hurts the most, Don?

05:20.145 --> 05:21.585
- My leg!
- He's bleeding really bad.

05:21.625 --> 05:23.627
- Yeah.
- It's too much blood.

05:23.671 --> 05:25.368
Am I gonna die?
Don't talk like that.

05:25.412 --> 05:26.891
We're gonna get you out of here.

05:26.935 --> 05:28.458
Something cut his thigh.

05:28.502 --> 05:30.808
It looks like
it must have been the artery.

05:30.852 --> 05:32.375
I can't reach it.

05:32.419 --> 05:33.657
Hey, give me an 18-gaugue
IV catheter with an EJ line

05:33.681 --> 05:35.900
and four units of O-neg
on the rapid transfuser.

05:35.944 --> 05:38.294
- Got it.
- April!

05:38.338 --> 05:39.687
April, you can't go under there!

05:39.730 --> 05:42.124
- It's okay, I got it!
- It hurts so bad, it hurts!

05:44.431 --> 05:46.476
Definitely arterial blood.
Maybe femoral.

05:46.520 --> 05:47.758
Can you get a tourniquet
above it?

05:47.782 --> 05:50.393
It's too high.
It's too high to clamp, too.

05:50.437 --> 05:52.830
If I can just
pinch my fingers around it...

05:52.874 --> 05:55.093
Okay, I got it.

05:55.137 --> 05:57.400
I pinched it off.

05:57.444 --> 05:59.489
Hey, hey, be careful up there!

06:02.013 --> 06:05.060
Please, please.

06:05.103 --> 06:08.063
Don't let anything happen to me.

06:08.106 --> 06:10.021
April, you gotta get
out of there.

06:10.065 --> 06:11.762
I'm not letting his artery go.

06:11.806 --> 06:14.417
She is the only thing that's
keeping him alive right now.

06:14.461 --> 06:16.680
CFD's gonna be here soon.

06:16.724 --> 06:18.639
Hold on.

06:18.682 --> 06:19.988
Sir?

06:20.031 --> 06:21.946
Sir, can you tell me your name?

06:21.990 --> 06:25.036
He's got a loud
diastolic rumble.

06:25.080 --> 06:26.560
It could be an embolic stroke.

06:26.603 --> 06:28.059
Which would mean
he passed out while driving.

06:28.083 --> 06:30.868
We need to get him up to CT!
Okay, let's move him!

06:30.912 --> 06:33.001
Get the gurney in here!

06:33.044 --> 06:36.221
- Clear out, folks.
- All right!

06:36.265 --> 06:38.398
All right, let's move him!
Come on!

06:38.441 --> 06:42.358
On my count. One, two, three.

06:42.402 --> 06:43.925
All right, all right, all right.

06:43.968 --> 06:46.493
Let's go. There we go.

06:46.536 --> 06:49.670
Ethan, page me when you're
ready to move Don, okay?

06:49.713 --> 06:51.193
Yeah!

06:51.236 --> 06:54.109
All right, let's go, let's go!

06:54.152 --> 06:57.895
Curry, we've got ambulances
lining up outside of the lobby!

06:57.939 --> 07:00.724
- Go help them!
- Absolutely.

07:03.335 --> 07:06.861
I got you.

07:08.776 --> 07:11.953
This is Sandy Glenn
and her husband, Drew.

07:11.996 --> 07:13.321
Passed out in her home
this morning.

07:13.345 --> 07:14.695
GCS 15, vitals stable.

07:14.738 --> 07:16.653
I'm Elsa Curry,
third-year medical student.

07:16.697 --> 07:17.959
Can you tell me what happened?

07:18.002 --> 07:19.439
I was just making some tea,

07:19.482 --> 07:20.962
then suddenly I saw stars.

07:21.005 --> 07:22.093
I found her on the floor.

07:22.137 --> 07:23.486
Has this ever happened before?

07:23.530 --> 07:24.705
No.

07:24.748 --> 07:26.204
But she does have
multiple sclerosis.

07:26.228 --> 07:27.490
Relapsing/remitting.

07:27.534 --> 07:28.772
Could it be the start
of a new episode?

07:28.796 --> 07:31.146
Yeah, it's possible.
Any other symptoms?

07:31.189 --> 07:33.104
Visual disturbances,
pain, incontinence?

07:33.148 --> 07:34.715
No, nothing like that.

07:34.758 --> 07:37.195
Okay, transfer on my count.

07:37.239 --> 07:40.503
One, two, three.

07:40.547 --> 07:43.854
Okay, yeah,
you've also got some dry skin,

07:43.898 --> 07:47.771
marked pallor,
and some peripheral edema.

07:47.815 --> 07:49.120
Have you been losing any weight?

07:49.164 --> 07:51.035
Maybe a little, but not much.

07:51.079 --> 07:52.796
All right, then my attending
and I are gonna order

07:52.820 --> 07:54.972
a full set of labs and have
neuro come down to take a look.

07:54.996 --> 07:56.824
I'll be back in a little bit.

08:03.178 --> 08:05.310
- April!
- Hey!

08:05.354 --> 08:06.877
We got here as fast as we could.

08:06.921 --> 08:09.358
- Kelly?
- April, you hit?

08:09.401 --> 08:10.925
No, no, no, I'm fine. It's Don.

08:10.968 --> 08:12.448
We gotta get him out of here.

08:12.492 --> 08:14.145
Just hold tight. We got it.

08:14.189 --> 08:15.538
Cruz, how's it look?

08:15.582 --> 08:18.367
His leg's stuck
in the wheel well.

08:18.410 --> 08:20.021
Okay, but how long
till we get him out?

08:20.064 --> 08:22.327
Well, we have to stabilize
the car with airbags

08:22.371 --> 08:23.633
and secure it with cribbing

08:23.677 --> 08:25.635
before we can even attempt
to remove that leg.

08:25.679 --> 08:28.246
We move too quick, whole thing
will come down on top of him.

08:28.290 --> 08:31.815
- All right, keep me posted.
- Yeah.

08:31.859 --> 08:34.164
Hey, Don?
Hey, you hang in there, okay?

08:34.208 --> 08:35.427
- I'll try my best.
- Good.

08:35.471 --> 08:37.168
We're working on a way
to get you out soon.

08:39.388 --> 08:41.869
Hey, come on.
I'll take over from here.

08:41.912 --> 08:43.827
No, don't leave me.
Don't leave me.

08:43.871 --> 08:45.046
No, it's fine.

08:45.089 --> 08:46.458
You're not gonna fit
under here, anyways.

08:46.482 --> 08:48.789
Look, April,
I can squeeze my way in.

08:48.832 --> 08:51.356
I said I'm fine.

08:55.186 --> 08:57.275
Dr. Choi.

09:00.888 --> 09:03.934
How's he doing?
He's lost a lot of blood.

09:03.978 --> 09:05.675
April's pinching off
his femoral artery,

09:05.719 --> 09:07.459
but he's still bleeding
into his pelvis.

09:07.503 --> 09:08.698
We've got him
on the rapid transfuser.

09:08.722 --> 09:10.811
I'm gonna have Dr. Lanik
take over from here.

09:10.854 --> 09:12.552
- What? Why?
- April's in danger.

09:12.595 --> 09:14.728
We need someone in charge
who's not as close to her.

09:14.771 --> 09:16.381
Ms. Goodwin,
I hear what you're saying,

09:16.425 --> 09:18.688
but April and I,
we're just coworkers.

09:18.732 --> 09:20.342
It's fine.

09:20.385 --> 09:23.258
Okay.

09:32.049 --> 09:34.399
Mr. Nichols, I'm Dr. Rhodes.

09:34.443 --> 09:36.053
This is Dr. Bekker.

09:36.097 --> 09:37.141
How are you feeling?

09:37.185 --> 09:40.405
Um, sore, but okay.

09:40.449 --> 09:42.320
I'm so sorry
about what happened.

09:42.364 --> 09:43.887
I was getting so numb and dizzy,

09:43.931 --> 09:45.889
and I just wanted
to get here, and...

09:45.933 --> 09:47.493
You passed out
while you were driving.

09:48.762 --> 09:50.720
Mr. Nichols, your scans show

09:50.764 --> 09:53.331
that you have a tumor growing
in your heart.

09:53.375 --> 09:54.681
It's called a myxoma.

09:54.724 --> 09:57.597
Now, it is most likely benign,
which means

09:57.640 --> 09:59.642
that it won't spread
to the rest of your body,

09:59.686 --> 10:02.471
but it is large enough
that pieces are breaking off

10:02.514 --> 10:04.647
and causing you
to have small strokes.

10:04.691 --> 10:06.301
So how do you fix it?

10:06.344 --> 10:07.868
Normally we'd
remove it surgically,

10:07.911 --> 10:09.652
but yours has grown
extremely large.

10:09.696 --> 10:12.481
We would like to put you
on the transplant list.

10:12.524 --> 10:14.483
Find you a new, healthy heart.

10:14.526 --> 10:17.094
Couldn't that take a while?

10:17.138 --> 10:18.681
What if I have another stroke?
I could die.

10:18.705 --> 10:20.837
Removing the tumor
is a very difficult procedure.

10:20.881 --> 10:23.753
If we try and are unsuccessful,
your body won't be able

10:23.797 --> 10:26.016
to tolerate a transplant
later on.

10:26.060 --> 10:27.515
But it's possible
you could get it all.

10:27.539 --> 10:28.671
It's possible.

10:28.715 --> 10:30.717
Then let's do it.

10:30.760 --> 10:33.328
Mr. Nichols,
I appreciate how eager you are

10:33.371 --> 10:34.677
to take care of this,

10:34.721 --> 10:38.507
but land wewould really
advise against that.

10:38.550 --> 10:41.336
This thing
almost killed me today.

10:41.379 --> 10:43.425
Please, take it out.

10:45.949 --> 10:47.777
Well, the risks are significant,

10:47.821 --> 10:49.779
but if you'd prefer
to take them,

10:49.823 --> 10:51.365
of course we'll do everything
we can to fix this.

10:51.389 --> 10:53.043
Yes.

10:53.087 --> 10:56.220
Thank you.

10:56.264 --> 10:59.484
All right, then.

10:59.528 --> 11:02.487
Ava, you realize what we are
committing ourselves to?

11:02.531 --> 11:03.793
I do.

11:03.837 --> 11:06.753
We get one shot
at opening him up.

11:06.796 --> 11:09.451
If we do it and we don't
succeed, he's gonna die.

11:09.494 --> 11:11.279
We can do it.

11:15.022 --> 11:16.632
Hi, Ben.

11:16.676 --> 11:18.025
So, good news.

11:18.068 --> 11:21.115
A new pair of lungs
have become available.

11:21.158 --> 11:22.725
Really?

11:22.769 --> 11:25.815
My God, Ben! That's amazing!

11:25.859 --> 11:26.966
Yeah, they're flying in now.

11:26.990 --> 11:28.228
Should be here
in a couple of hours.

11:28.252 --> 11:29.993
So I'm getting them today?

11:30.037 --> 11:32.604
I'll call surgery now.

11:36.347 --> 11:38.480
Hey, you here for your check-up?

11:38.523 --> 11:40.569
- That we are.
- Hi, Sophie.

11:40.612 --> 11:43.137
I think she's waking up.

11:43.180 --> 11:46.488
I hope the, umthe doctors
will warm his fingers up.

11:46.531 --> 11:48.708
I heard
they charge extra for that.

11:48.751 --> 11:50.448
But maybe I can put in
a good word.

11:52.537 --> 11:53.887
I'll call surgery for Ben.

11:53.930 --> 11:56.019
Thanks.
Why don't I take you guys up?

11:56.063 --> 11:57.368
Great, yeah.

11:57.412 --> 11:59.501
Everything's all right.

11:59.544 --> 12:02.069
All right.

12:05.115 --> 12:06.682
Dr. Choi!

12:06.726 --> 12:09.729
Don needs you right now.

12:09.772 --> 12:12.906
I can't breathe.

12:12.949 --> 12:14.255
What happened?

12:14.298 --> 12:15.536
He just started wheezing
a minute or two ago.

12:15.560 --> 12:17.388
It's just getting worse.
I can't breathe.

12:17.432 --> 12:18.738
I can't breathe.

12:18.781 --> 12:20.348
He's having
a transfusion reaction.

12:20.391 --> 12:21.784
We gotta stop the blood.

12:21.828 --> 12:24.831
Give me 50 milligrams
of diphenhydramine, stat.

12:24.874 --> 12:26.746
What's happening to me?
Am I gonna be okay?

12:26.789 --> 12:28.071
You're having
an allergic reaction.

12:28.095 --> 12:29.749
They're gonna have
to stop the blood.

12:29.792 --> 12:32.229
But I'm still bleeding, right?

12:32.273 --> 12:34.057
All right.

12:34.101 --> 12:36.190
- Cruz!
- Yeah?

12:36.233 --> 12:37.582
How close are you?

12:37.626 --> 12:38.845
Leg's almost free,

12:38.888 --> 12:40.344
but there's a lot
of jagged metal down here.

12:40.368 --> 12:42.718
We gotta move this whole thing
at least eight inches,

12:42.762 --> 12:44.415
stabilize it
before we can move anybody.

12:44.459 --> 12:45.765
It's gonna be a while.

12:45.808 --> 12:47.592
I can't give him anymore blood.

12:47.636 --> 12:49.092
How long is a while?
What can I tell you?

12:49.116 --> 12:52.249
We're working.

12:55.296 --> 12:56.906
April?

12:56.950 --> 12:59.909
Just let me switch out with you.

12:59.953 --> 13:02.869
Ethan, I am not leaving him.

13:11.791 --> 13:16.099
Okay, so, anemic, hypoglycemic.

13:16.143 --> 13:19.146
Low vitamin B12 and calcium.

13:19.189 --> 13:21.539
EKG changes.

13:21.583 --> 13:22.932
It ain't good,

13:22.976 --> 13:25.369
but it doesn't look like
an exacerbation of her MS.

13:25.413 --> 13:29.069
No, it looks like anorexia,
but she's not underweight.

13:29.112 --> 13:32.115
Which doesn't necessarily
exclude the disorder.

13:32.159 --> 13:34.857
Let's go say hi.

13:34.901 --> 13:36.293
I'm Dr. Charles.

13:36.337 --> 13:38.861
Ms. Curry wanted me to...
To say a quick hello.

13:38.905 --> 13:41.037
Were my test results bad?

13:41.081 --> 13:43.257
We're worried
about your nutrition.

13:43.300 --> 13:45.215
Have you been experiencing
any digestive issues

13:45.259 --> 13:47.348
or decreased appetite?

13:47.391 --> 13:49.263
No.

13:49.306 --> 13:52.614
No? Okay, that's good.

13:52.657 --> 13:54.200
Are you concerned
about your weight at all, or...

13:54.224 --> 13:56.836
Or even, say,
your appearance in general?

13:56.879 --> 13:58.968
I'm not anorexic.

13:59.012 --> 14:00.927
I have a tapeworm.

14:00.970 --> 14:02.319
A tapeworm?

14:02.363 --> 14:05.366
Yes, I infected myself
on purpose for my MS.

14:05.409 --> 14:08.151
There's this thing
called helminthic therapy...

14:08.195 --> 14:09.500
Yeah, for autoimmune diseases.

14:09.544 --> 14:10.893
It'sit's really cutting edge.

14:10.937 --> 14:12.503
- You've heard of it?
- Yes.

14:12.547 --> 14:15.202
Basically, the hypothesis
is that a worm infestation

14:15.245 --> 14:16.396
can activate your immune system

14:16.420 --> 14:17.789
to fight against
certain conditions.

14:17.813 --> 14:19.269
You know, there's actually
quite a few centers

14:19.293 --> 14:21.121
that are doing clinical trials.

14:21.164 --> 14:22.489
She couldn't get in
to any of them.

14:22.513 --> 14:25.125
Have you discussed this
with your neurologist?

14:25.168 --> 14:27.127
'Cause there are
several new therapies for MS.

14:27.170 --> 14:29.912
And, you know, modulators...
Steroids, Cytoxan.

14:29.956 --> 14:31.087
I've tried everything.

14:31.131 --> 14:32.262
But since I started this,

14:32.306 --> 14:33.849
I haven't had an episode
in three months.

14:33.873 --> 14:35.178
Really?

14:35.222 --> 14:37.267
Okay, what is
your normal remission rate?

14:37.311 --> 14:39.158
Because anything longer
than two standard deviations

14:39.182 --> 14:41.358
and we could probably publish
a case study.

14:41.402 --> 14:43.795
Um, could you excuse us
for a second?

14:43.839 --> 14:46.059
Ms. Curry.

14:50.628 --> 14:52.717
Ms. Curry, I appreciate
your enthusiasm,

14:52.761 --> 14:55.416
but these trials are held under
strict medical supervision.

14:55.459 --> 14:57.374
She's doing it on her own.

14:57.418 --> 14:59.091
I know, but this is the
front line of immunotherapy.

14:59.115 --> 15:00.440
I mean, we could find
a positive result.

15:00.464 --> 15:02.945
That woman passed out today
from malnourishment.

15:02.989 --> 15:04.991
That's what we're treating here.

15:05.034 --> 15:06.340
Or we can work with her.

15:06.383 --> 15:07.689
Wewe can modify her diet,

15:07.732 --> 15:09.145
we canwe can give her
higher calorie foods...

15:09.169 --> 15:10.344
The patient has a parasite,

15:10.387 --> 15:11.495
and it is clearly undermining
her health.

15:11.519 --> 15:12.781
Dr. Charles, I really...

15:12.824 --> 15:14.870
Let's start with
400 milligrams of Albendazole

15:14.914 --> 15:16.350
and hang a liter of D5W.

15:16.393 --> 15:19.831
Thanks.

15:27.404 --> 15:31.713
Looks like things between you
and Phillip are going well.

15:31.756 --> 15:33.367
He's still having a tough time,

15:33.410 --> 15:35.804
but it's slowly getting better.

15:39.199 --> 15:41.723
He's lucky to have you.

15:43.464 --> 15:47.120
Dr. Halstead, Dr. Manning,
Ben's sats are dropping.

15:49.426 --> 15:52.995
Please, help him.

15:53.039 --> 15:55.171
Sats are down to 82.

15:57.043 --> 15:58.522
No breath sounds on the left.

15:58.566 --> 16:00.046
It's likely a pneumothorax.

16:00.089 --> 16:01.743
- I'll get a chest tube kit.
- Wait.

16:01.786 --> 16:04.006
Do you know how many
chest tubes you've had before?

16:04.050 --> 16:06.226
Four.

16:06.269 --> 16:07.638
His lungs
are likely scarred as-is.

16:07.662 --> 16:09.161
Another chest tube will only
jeopardize his ability

16:09.185 --> 16:10.404
to receive a transplant.

16:10.447 --> 16:11.685
But the new lungs
are still an hour out.

16:11.709 --> 16:13.276
I don't think he'll make it
like this.

16:13.320 --> 16:15.931
I can make it.

16:15.975 --> 16:18.151
We can give him steroids
and put him on a mask.

16:18.194 --> 16:20.022
It's worth a try.

16:20.066 --> 16:21.937
Okay, let's give him
60 milligrams

16:21.981 --> 16:24.940
of methylprednisolone
and up the O2 to ten liters.

16:24.984 --> 16:26.376
Hang in there, Ben.

16:26.420 --> 16:29.640
We're gonna send you up
to prep for surgery soon.

16:35.777 --> 16:37.997
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Ethan?

16:38.040 --> 16:41.043
He is losing consciousness.
We gotta get him out of here.

16:41.087 --> 16:43.263
Hey, Don? Don, can you hear me?

16:43.306 --> 16:46.353
- I'm so tired.
- Stay with me, Don.

16:46.396 --> 16:48.485
Kelly, you guys ready to go yet?

16:48.529 --> 16:50.183
The back wheels
are still too unstable.

16:50.226 --> 16:52.117
We need a little bit more time.
No, we don't have more time.

16:52.141 --> 16:53.447
Don's lost too much blood.

16:53.490 --> 16:55.144
We're not moving anyone
until it's safe.

16:55.188 --> 16:56.145
No, Ethan...

16:56.189 --> 16:58.800
I'm sorry, April.

16:58.843 --> 17:00.671
Kelly!

17:00.715 --> 17:02.456
He's dying.
We have to move him now.

17:02.499 --> 17:04.893
Dr. Choi, is that true?

17:04.935 --> 17:08.027
- How unstable is the car?
- It's not where we'd like it.

17:08.069 --> 17:10.811
If we move now, can't
promise you it won't collapse.

17:10.855 --> 17:12.814
Kelly!

17:12.857 --> 17:14.816
Do it!

17:14.858 --> 17:18.253
You start pressors,
I'll up his fluids.

17:18.298 --> 17:20.517
Keep working.
We're waiting till it's safe.

17:20.560 --> 17:23.651
- Ethan!
- We're waiting.

17:29.787 --> 17:31.267
What's going on?

17:31.311 --> 17:34.140
Turned into a tension pneumo.
We have to needle it.

17:43.497 --> 17:46.021
His sats aren't coming up.
It's not working.

17:46.065 --> 17:47.694
The new lungs
are still 15 minutes away.

17:47.718 --> 17:49.068
He's not gonna make it
that long.

17:49.111 --> 17:50.895
We have to do a chest tube.

17:50.939 --> 17:53.594
If we do it, he may not
be able to get a transplant.

17:53.637 --> 17:57.554
We have to do this.

17:57.598 --> 18:00.514
- Get the chest tube kit.
- No, wait!

18:00.557 --> 18:02.342
I'm sorry.

18:04.344 --> 18:08.304
Sats are down to 71.

18:08.348 --> 18:11.046
What about his transplant?

18:11.090 --> 18:13.527
We don't have a choice.

18:13.570 --> 18:16.921
Okay, making the incision.

18:27.149 --> 18:29.325
I'm in.

18:29.369 --> 18:30.979
Sats back up to 80.

18:31.022 --> 18:32.546
83.

18:32.589 --> 18:34.374
All right, tell radiology

18:34.417 --> 18:36.680
he needs a stat chest CT
before he goes to the OR.

18:48.431 --> 18:50.303
I can't get an angle on this.

18:50.346 --> 18:54.263
Reflect the atrium.

18:54.307 --> 18:56.396
That's as far back
as it's gonna go.

18:56.439 --> 19:00.139
I can't get around it.

19:00.182 --> 19:02.924
Damn it.

19:02.967 --> 19:04.467
The tumor's extended
too far into the auricle.

19:04.491 --> 19:08.712
And into the valve
and the SA node.

19:08.756 --> 19:10.821
I don't see how we're ever
gonna get the margins clear.

19:10.845 --> 19:12.673
We may have
to close him back up.

19:12.716 --> 19:14.065
But we can't close him back up.

19:14.109 --> 19:15.652
He's never gonna survive
another procedure.

19:15.676 --> 19:18.200
We need to fix this today.

19:18.244 --> 19:21.334
Let me try it from here.

19:21.377 --> 19:24.554
Reflect the atrium.
Yes, sir. Forceps.

19:24.598 --> 19:26.252
Right here.

19:26.295 --> 19:27.992
Dr. Rhodes?

19:28.036 --> 19:31.213
They're ready to extract
the patient from under the car.

19:33.259 --> 19:36.523
Okay.

19:36.566 --> 19:40.222
Keep dissecting.

19:40.266 --> 19:42.964
It's the only option we have.

19:47.708 --> 19:49.362
- Go grab a board.
- Ethan.

19:49.405 --> 19:51.015
Hey, team's in place.

19:51.059 --> 19:53.192
Soon as he's out, Maggie and I
will bind the pelvis

19:53.235 --> 19:54.802
while you clamp off the artery.

19:54.845 --> 19:57.370
Whoa, why isn't he on
the rapid transfuser?

19:57.413 --> 19:58.564
He had a reaction to the blood.

19:58.588 --> 20:00.286
We had to take him off.

20:00.329 --> 20:01.809
And he's been down there
this long?

20:01.852 --> 20:03.202
Yeah.

20:03.245 --> 20:04.594
He's lost too much blood

20:04.638 --> 20:06.161
and his pressure's
in the toilet.

20:06.205 --> 20:08.946
Even if we are perfect on this,
it might not be enough.

20:08.990 --> 20:12.689
I know.

20:12.733 --> 20:14.133
Man, I know
that this is delicate,

20:14.169 --> 20:17.303
but is Don an organ donor?

20:17.346 --> 20:20.131
I don't know.

20:20.175 --> 20:21.307
The driver.

20:21.350 --> 20:24.266
He needs a new heart.

20:24.310 --> 20:26.834
God.

20:26.877 --> 20:29.619
Yeah.

20:35.495 --> 20:38.280
Don, Don, it's time
to get you out of here.

20:38.324 --> 20:41.892
You have lost a lot of blood.
I know.

20:41.936 --> 20:43.851
Your condition
is extremely serious,

20:43.894 --> 20:45.679
and you know
that in cases like this,

20:45.722 --> 20:47.028
we'd like to have a plan.

20:47.071 --> 20:50.640
You wanna know
if I'm an organ donor.

20:50.684 --> 20:53.339
You're a healthcare worker,
Don, you understand.

20:53.382 --> 20:55.254
You said you were gonna save me.

20:55.297 --> 20:56.342
I know. We are, Don.

20:56.385 --> 20:57.580
Don, we're gonna do everything

20:57.604 --> 20:58.692
that we possibly can...

20:58.735 --> 20:59.823
I don't want to die.

20:59.867 --> 21:01.260
Stop, guys, you're scaring him.

21:01.303 --> 21:03.262
- April, please.
- Get me out.

21:03.305 --> 21:06.352
- Just get me out.
- Don, Don?

21:06.395 --> 21:08.310
Kelly, we gotta go now.

21:08.354 --> 21:10.094
- Let's move!
- Ready?

21:10.138 --> 21:11.705
- Up on blue!
- Copy that.

21:11.748 --> 21:13.663
Up on blue.

21:15.274 --> 21:17.537
Let's get it in.

21:19.930 --> 21:21.323
- Okay, ready?
- Yep.

21:21.367 --> 21:23.760
- One, two, three.
- There we go.

21:25.153 --> 21:26.850
- Gonna roll him!
- Yep!

21:26.894 --> 21:29.157
- Roll!
- Roll!

21:29.200 --> 21:31.638
You're good.

21:35.990 --> 21:37.905
- Clamp?
- Clamp!

21:37.948 --> 21:39.385
- All right, April.
- Yep!

21:39.428 --> 21:40.884
Faster, let's go!
He's gonna bleed out!

21:40.908 --> 21:44.868
Clamps are on!

21:44.912 --> 21:47.131
Heartrate's 140!
Sats are dropping!

21:47.175 --> 21:49.046
Let's go, let's move!
All right, on my count!

21:49.090 --> 21:50.918
One, two, three!

21:50.961 --> 21:53.007
Let's go!
Come on, let's move, people!

21:53.050 --> 21:54.922
He's crashing!

21:54.965 --> 21:57.577
All right, let's move!
Move, move!

22:08.675 --> 22:10.285
Whoa, what's going on?

22:10.329 --> 22:11.741
Dr. Latham called
the transplant off.

22:11.765 --> 22:13.308
What do you mean?
The new lungs are ready to go.

22:13.332 --> 22:14.772
The chest tube caused
a hemothorax,

22:14.811 --> 22:15.962
and that's on top of the damage

22:15.986 --> 22:17.423
from all his
previous procedures.

22:17.466 --> 22:19.729
He'd bleed out before
we even got the new lungs in.

22:19.773 --> 22:21.577
Nothing we've tried
has touched his infection.

22:21.601 --> 22:23.777
If he doesn't get this
transplant, he's going to die.

22:23.820 --> 22:27.171
Dr. Latham says his lungs
are completely fused

22:27.215 --> 22:28.390
to his chest wall.

22:28.434 --> 22:30.566
It's just not possible.

22:30.610 --> 22:33.526
I'm sorry.

22:37.791 --> 22:39.314
God!

22:39.358 --> 22:42.012
God, here.

22:42.056 --> 22:43.840
God.

22:43.884 --> 22:45.799
- God.
- You okay?

22:45.842 --> 22:47.844
God. Yeah, I'm okay.

22:47.888 --> 22:49.846
Hang a bag of Zofran.

22:49.890 --> 22:52.066
No, I don't want any Zofran.

22:52.109 --> 22:53.173
Honey, youyou're nauseous.

22:53.197 --> 22:54.808
It'll make you feel
so much better.

22:54.851 --> 22:57.376
Go get the Zofran.
No, I don't want any Zofran.

22:57.419 --> 23:00.248
I take the Zofran, I get tired.

23:00.291 --> 23:02.032
When I get tired, I nap,

23:02.076 --> 23:03.382
and then I can't sleep at night.

23:03.425 --> 23:05.253
I don't want any Zofran.

23:05.296 --> 23:07.057
Okay, well, we can get you
something to help you sleep.

23:07.081 --> 23:08.996
Ask Dr. Singh
to write an order for, um...

23:09.039 --> 23:12.521
Will you stop it, please?

23:12.565 --> 23:14.305
Okay, will you leave, please?

23:14.349 --> 23:16.264
I want you to get out.

23:16.307 --> 23:18.527
Okay, okay.

23:18.571 --> 23:20.181
I'll be back in a little while...

23:20.224 --> 23:22.618
20, 30 minutesjust to see if
you're still feeling nauseous.

23:22.662 --> 23:23.924
No!

23:23.967 --> 23:26.579
Don't come back!

23:26.622 --> 23:29.277
I want you out!

23:41.115 --> 23:42.333
How's Don?

23:42.377 --> 23:44.031
His pelvis
is completely shattered.

23:44.074 --> 23:46.163
It's still touch and go.

23:46.207 --> 23:48.209
What?

23:48.252 --> 23:51.212
If he doesn't make it,
that's a heart wasted.

23:51.255 --> 23:53.301
He was terrified, Ethan.

23:53.344 --> 23:54.911
It was wrong of you to ask him.

23:54.955 --> 23:57.610
- How could we not?
- He wanted us to save him.

23:57.653 --> 23:59.481
And we are!
We're doing everything we can!

23:59.525 --> 24:01.048
You did not
do everything you could.

24:01.091 --> 24:02.504
You should have
gotten Don out sooner.

24:02.528 --> 24:03.548
That car could have collapsed.

24:03.572 --> 24:05.052
I wanted to make sure
he was safe.

24:05.095 --> 24:06.880
No, you wanted to make sure
I was safe!

24:06.923 --> 24:08.925
But I wasn't
your patient, Ethan.

24:08.969 --> 24:11.232
He was.

24:26.160 --> 24:28.423
Okay, so, um,
if you email me the details,

24:28.467 --> 24:29.903
I'll follow up with you
in a week

24:29.946 --> 24:31.339
and we can take it from there.

24:31.382 --> 24:34.037
Ms. Curry? What are you doing?

24:34.081 --> 24:36.431
She wanted to be discharged.

24:36.475 --> 24:37.911
She's severely anemic.

24:37.954 --> 24:39.715
She could pass out before
she gets to the parking lot.

24:39.739 --> 24:41.586
I mean, I scheduled a visit
with a nutritionist

24:41.610 --> 24:43.133
and I'm gonna
monitor her closely.

24:43.177 --> 24:45.440
Ms. Glenn?

24:45.484 --> 24:47.442
You're aware that this worm
puts you at risk

24:47.486 --> 24:50.619
of pancreatitis,
heart disease, arrhythmia...

24:50.663 --> 24:52.926
I know, but it's the only
thing that's helped my MS.

24:52.969 --> 24:55.145
Trust me, correlation
is not necessarily causation.

24:55.189 --> 24:56.625
What does that mean?

24:56.669 --> 24:58.255
He doesn't think that
the absence of MS symptoms

24:58.279 --> 24:59.410
is related to the tapeworm.

24:59.454 --> 25:01.500
Not what I said.

25:01.543 --> 25:04.328
Whether it's helping you
or not, the side effects

25:04.372 --> 25:06.026
are seriously endangering
your health.

25:06.069 --> 25:07.114
I don't agree.

25:07.157 --> 25:08.942
I know how I feel,
and I'm going home.

25:08.985 --> 25:10.944
Well, then, I'm sorry,
you leave me no choice

25:10.987 --> 25:13.120
but to put you on a psych hold.

25:13.163 --> 25:15.209
- What?
- You can't make her stay here!

25:15.252 --> 25:16.515
I'm afraid I can.

25:16.558 --> 25:17.709
Right now, your wife
is a danger to herself.

25:17.733 --> 25:19.735
My job is to protect her.
Earl, back in 4.

25:19.779 --> 25:21.520
NoDr. Charles,
what are you doing?

25:21.563 --> 25:22.975
- Come with me, ma'am.
- Let go of me!

25:22.999 --> 25:24.174
Hey, what are you doing?

25:24.218 --> 25:25.761
- You can't keep me here!
- Dr. Charles!

25:25.785 --> 25:28.439
- You can't keep me here!
- Get off of her!

25:35.577 --> 25:37.536
Hey, my mom,

25:37.579 --> 25:39.426
she was feeling some tightness
in her chest before, so...

25:39.450 --> 25:40.669
Yeah, of course.

25:40.713 --> 25:42.279
I'lll'll check on her
as soon as I can.

25:42.323 --> 25:44.194
Okay, thankhey.

25:44.238 --> 25:46.240
- What's the matter?
- Tough case.

25:46.283 --> 25:48.590
We allowed this patient
to talk us into removing

25:48.634 --> 25:49.809
his cardiac myxoma

25:49.852 --> 25:50.960
when we should have
done a transplant

25:50.984 --> 25:54.465
and now, well,
he's probably gonna die.

25:54.509 --> 25:56.032
Why can't you remove it?

25:56.076 --> 25:58.339
Well, itit's too extensive.

25:58.382 --> 25:59.732
We'd never get it all.

25:59.775 --> 26:03.431
Could you get it all
with an autotransplant?

26:03.474 --> 26:05.651
You're talking about
completely removing

26:05.694 --> 26:06.956
his heart from his body.

26:07.000 --> 26:09.524
I mean, we could get
at the whole tumor,

26:09.568 --> 26:10.873
but the damage is so extensive

26:10.917 --> 26:12.875
the odds of reimplantation
are miniscule.

26:12.919 --> 26:14.137
That might not be true.

26:14.181 --> 26:16.183
The chief of CT
back at my hospital?

26:16.226 --> 26:18.838
He did a 12-patient trial
on reimplantation

26:18.881 --> 26:20.404
after ice bath dissection.

26:20.448 --> 26:23.016
He hasn't published yet
but he got good results.

26:23.059 --> 26:25.932
- What kind of results?
- Greater than 50%.

26:25.975 --> 26:29.109
"Greater than 50%"? You're sure?

26:29.152 --> 26:30.956
Yeah, I can get you
the details on the procedure.

26:30.980 --> 26:32.503
Do it, fast.

26:32.547 --> 26:33.940
I'm gonna be back in the OR.

26:33.983 --> 26:35.724
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

26:35.768 --> 26:37.465
Okay.

26:42.209 --> 26:44.646
I gotta go.

26:49.738 --> 26:51.653
Hey.

26:56.136 --> 26:57.722
Four months ago,
we were getting married.

26:57.746 --> 27:00.923
Today I gave her
her house key back.

27:00.967 --> 27:02.577
I know.

27:04.710 --> 27:07.538
What do I do?

27:09.932 --> 27:11.717
Come on.

27:11.760 --> 27:14.458
Let's get back to work.

27:37.960 --> 27:41.572
Don's still in surgery.
It's not going well.

27:41.616 --> 27:43.836
If he dies,
I accept full responsibility.

27:43.879 --> 27:45.838
I looked at the notes,
spoke with CFD.

27:45.881 --> 27:47.056
Lieutenant Severide said

27:47.100 --> 27:49.624
you were faced
with some tough decisions,

27:49.668 --> 27:52.671
especially regarding April.

27:52.714 --> 27:54.934
You tried to warn me.

27:54.977 --> 27:57.458
Being responsible
for people's lives

27:57.501 --> 27:59.242
is never easy, Dr. Choi.

27:59.286 --> 28:03.856
Let's all just hope that
things work out for the best.

28:03.899 --> 28:06.380
Yes, ma'am.

28:20.176 --> 28:22.657
The antibiotics
aren't working, are they?

28:22.701 --> 28:25.094
No, they're not.

28:30.578 --> 28:32.145
Lisa.

28:32.188 --> 28:34.451
I spoke with
the transplant coordinator.

28:34.495 --> 28:37.672
No one ahead of you on the list
can get here

28:37.716 --> 28:39.979
before the donor lungs expire,

28:40.022 --> 28:41.937
which means you're up next.

28:44.113 --> 28:46.333
To get a transplant?

28:46.376 --> 28:47.813
Yes.

28:54.341 --> 28:56.952
I can't.

28:56.996 --> 28:59.433
Not if he's going to die.

28:59.476 --> 29:00.651
He's septic.

29:00.695 --> 29:02.392
He has a DNR.

29:02.436 --> 29:04.699
Therethere's nothing you can do.

29:04.743 --> 29:07.746
I can be here with him.

29:07.789 --> 29:09.748
I have to be here.

29:13.577 --> 29:16.015
He's amazing.

29:16.058 --> 29:18.147
Never complains.

29:18.191 --> 29:20.541
Most people born
with something like this

29:20.584 --> 29:22.935
would say, "Why me?"

29:22.978 --> 29:26.112
But Ben, he's always saying,
"Why not me?"

29:26.155 --> 29:29.724
He taught me to be grateful
for what I have.

29:29.768 --> 29:33.119
And I am.

29:33.162 --> 29:36.035
I understand.

29:36.078 --> 29:38.864
But you need these lungs, too.

29:41.257 --> 29:43.433
I still have time.

29:43.477 --> 29:46.262
Another pair will come up. Lisa-

29:46.306 --> 29:47.829
- No.

29:47.873 --> 29:49.875
I'm sorry.

29:49.918 --> 29:51.833
No.

30:05.586 --> 30:07.849
Mind if I come in?

30:07.893 --> 30:10.373
Not at all.

30:13.986 --> 30:16.118
You okay?

30:16.162 --> 30:19.034
What, you mean
that whole thing down there?

30:19.078 --> 30:20.601
I mean, I wish
it hadn't come to that,

30:20.644 --> 30:23.082
but, yeah, I'm fine.

30:23.125 --> 30:26.607
Didn't look that way to me.

30:26.650 --> 30:29.218
Now, we've worked together
a long time, Daniel.

30:29.262 --> 30:31.612
You usually empower
your patients

30:31.655 --> 30:33.440
to make their own choices.

30:33.483 --> 30:36.443
Putting that woman
on a psych hold?

30:36.486 --> 30:38.271
Sharon, I made
a clinical decision

30:38.314 --> 30:39.881
for her own wellbeing.

30:39.925 --> 30:41.448
Don't know what to tell you.

30:41.491 --> 30:45.191
Look, I know watching Cece
go through treatment

30:45.234 --> 30:47.933
has been very hard on you.

30:47.976 --> 30:50.936
It's making you feel
a little helpless.

30:50.979 --> 30:53.242
But...

30:53.286 --> 30:57.290
bringing your emotions to work?

31:35.197 --> 31:37.330
I really don't like this.

31:37.373 --> 31:39.462
You have a better idea?

31:39.506 --> 31:42.161
You don't know how you're
going to restart his heart.

31:42.204 --> 31:44.554
Robin's on the phone right now.

31:45.599 --> 31:46.881
She'll have answers for us soon.

31:46.905 --> 31:48.123
Robin.

31:48.167 --> 31:49.995
Not a cardiothoracic surgeon,

31:50.038 --> 31:52.693
not even an amiable
country doctor.

31:52.736 --> 31:54.564
I trust her.

32:07.838 --> 32:09.101
Why isn't Lisa in surgery?

32:09.144 --> 32:11.103
You told her she was next up.

32:11.146 --> 32:13.192
She won't leave Ben.

32:13.235 --> 32:15.237
Not while he's still alive.

32:33.038 --> 32:35.562
Lisa, you and Ben have never
been able to be together.

32:35.605 --> 32:38.260
But what if there was a way
you could be?

32:38.304 --> 32:42.003
Not through a pane of glass.

32:42.047 --> 32:44.136
We could?

32:44.179 --> 32:45.267
Yes.

32:45.311 --> 32:47.008
It could only be
for a minute, though,

32:47.052 --> 32:50.838
because you'd have to agree
to take the new lungs.

32:53.928 --> 32:55.756
No.

32:55.799 --> 32:57.149
I can't.

32:57.192 --> 33:00.543
Don't you think Ben
would want you to have them?

33:02.545 --> 33:04.286
I can't leave him now.

33:04.330 --> 33:07.594
It wouldn't be leaving him.

33:07.637 --> 33:11.511
It'd be giving him what
you both have always wanted.

33:14.775 --> 33:17.517
Lisa, this is
the memory you'll have

33:17.560 --> 33:18.735
for the rest of your life.

33:18.779 --> 33:22.652
The one moment
you were truly together.

33:32.010 --> 33:33.968
Okay.

33:34.012 --> 33:36.014
Okay.

33:56.817 --> 33:58.688
Lisa, no.

33:58.732 --> 34:00.429
It's okay.

34:00.473 --> 34:02.953
It's okay. I promise, Ben.

35:11.196 --> 35:14.373
Love you, Ben.

35:17.245 --> 35:19.856
I love you.

36:02.508 --> 36:04.336
It's outrageous, I...

36:04.379 --> 36:06.729
What recourse do we have?

36:06.773 --> 36:08.383
My husband's talking
to our lawyer.

36:08.427 --> 36:09.689
We're going to sue you.

36:09.732 --> 36:11.647
That won't be necessary.

36:11.691 --> 36:14.215
I'm releasing the psych hold.
You can go home.

36:14.259 --> 36:16.086
What?

36:16.130 --> 36:19.307
I'm discharging you.
You're free to go.

36:20.656 --> 36:22.180
Okay.

36:22.223 --> 36:25.270
Well, good luck.
Hope you feel better.

36:27.446 --> 36:29.448
Follow up with her neurologist.

36:29.491 --> 36:32.886
Stay on top of those labs,
and, um...

36:32.929 --> 36:34.931
keep me updated
as to her progress.

36:34.975 --> 36:37.195
- Of course.
- Thank you.

36:46.204 --> 36:47.640
You know there's
no published data

36:47.683 --> 36:50.251
on intracardiac pacemaker use
in reimplanted hearts?

36:50.295 --> 36:51.905
I am aware.

36:51.948 --> 36:54.255
So do you have a plan
for what to do

36:54.299 --> 36:56.388
if it doesn't catch?

36:58.303 --> 36:59.956
No.

37:00.000 --> 37:02.785
Great.

37:02.829 --> 37:06.441
All right, here we go.

37:24.503 --> 37:26.940
Well, will you look at that?

37:32.337 --> 37:34.010
All right, we still have
a lot of work to do.

37:34.034 --> 37:37.559
Let's get him off bypass.
Yes, Doctor.

37:56.186 --> 37:58.319
V-fib.

38:01.191 --> 38:04.325
He's DNR.
Nothing more we can do.

38:10.418 --> 38:13.987
Time of death, 1942.

38:29.872 --> 38:31.787
They were able
to set his pelvis.

38:31.831 --> 38:33.671
They actually think he'll make
a full recovery.

38:33.702 --> 38:35.617
Are you all right?

38:35.661 --> 38:38.359
I was worried about you today.

38:39.882 --> 38:42.537
Did it clould my judgment?

38:42.581 --> 38:44.800
Maybe.

38:44.844 --> 38:47.499
But either way,
there's no place for that here.

38:55.420 --> 38:57.509
Thank you.

38:58.597 --> 39:01.034
For caring.

39:06.039 --> 39:09.608
Lisa, I'm so sorry.

39:09.651 --> 39:12.219
Ben has passed.

40:08.014 --> 40:11.278
- Natalie!
- Yeah?

40:15.587 --> 40:18.590
You and I...

40:18.633 --> 40:21.462
we have some good memories.

40:21.506 --> 40:23.464
Don't we?

40:25.988 --> 40:28.817
Yes, we do.
