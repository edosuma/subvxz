01:01.936 --> 01:06.315
<i>The rumors of my promiscuity</i>
<i>have been greatly exaggerated.</i>

01:06.524 --> 01:10.277
<i>I used to be anonymous,</i>
<i>invisible to the opposite sex.</i>

01:10.445 --> 01:12.237
<i>If Google Earth were a guy...</i>

01:12.405 --> 01:15.449
<i>... he couldn't find me if I was</i>
<i>dressed up as a 10-story building.</i>

01:15.617 --> 01:19.328
<i>Pretty cutting-edge stuff, huh?</i>
<i>A high school girl feeling anonymous.</i>

01:19.496 --> 01:22.956
<i>Who am I? What does it all mean?</i>
<i>Why am I here? Blah.</i>

01:23.124 --> 01:26.376
<i>But don't worry,</i>
<i>this isn't one of those tales.</i>

01:26.544 --> 01:28.504
<i>Though it sure started out that way.</i>

01:28.671 --> 01:31.381
<i>And then it changed pretty quickly</i>
<i>when I started lying...</i>

01:31.549 --> 01:34.176
<i>... about some very personal things.</i>

01:34.344 --> 01:38.138
<i>So let the record show that I,</i>
<i>Olive Penderghast...</i>

01:38.306 --> 01:43.060
<i>... being of sound mind,</i>
<i>and below-average breast size...</i>

01:43.311 --> 01:45.395
<i>... swear to tell the truth,</i>
<i>the whole truth...</i>

01:45.563 --> 01:48.649
<i>... and nothing but the truth.</i>
<i>Starting now.</i>

01:49.567 --> 01:51.902
<i>And what better way</i>
<i>to share my private thoughts...</i>

01:52.070 --> 01:53.987
<i>... than to broadcast them</i>
<i>on the Internet?</i>

01:54.489 --> 01:57.491
So here it is. Part one.

01:58.493 --> 02:02.663
The shudder-inducing and cliched,
however totally false account...

02:02.831 --> 02:07.042
...of how I lost my virginity
to a guy at a community college.

02:07.585 --> 02:12.047
Let me just begin by saying
that there are two sides to every story.

02:12.215 --> 02:15.134
And this is my side, the right one.

02:15.301 --> 02:17.052
George is not a sexy name.

02:17.220 --> 02:19.138
George is what you name
your teddy bear...

02:19.305 --> 02:21.640
...not the name you wanna
scream out during climax.

02:21.808 --> 02:24.560
And by that, I assume you mean?

02:24.727 --> 02:27.271
The stable and self-perpetuating
end stage...

02:27.438 --> 02:29.314
...in the evolution
of a plant community.

02:29.482 --> 02:31.150
- Right.
- Why, what were you thinking?

02:31.317 --> 02:35.237
The same. But I don't say it out loud
lest someone get the wrong idea.

02:35.405 --> 02:38.323
I think you know innuendo
is attached to everything these days.

02:38.491 --> 02:40.534
Innuendo? What...?
Whatever do you mean?

02:40.702 --> 02:44.204
Rhiannon, Olive, go hit the books.
They don't hit back.

02:44.372 --> 02:48.917
Also, hugs not drugs.
Mess with the bull, get the horns.

02:49.085 --> 02:51.670
And any other cliches
you can come up with.

02:52.589 --> 02:54.298
Bye, Mr. Griffith.

02:54.465 --> 02:55.757
Bye.

02:55.925 --> 02:58.385
- Watch your mouth.
- Sorry.

02:58.803 --> 03:00.888
<i>Mr. Griffith is my favorite teacher.</i>

03:01.055 --> 03:03.015
<i>Although,</i>
<i>after all the trouble I caused...</i>

03:03.183 --> 03:05.434
<i>... I don't know if I'm still</i>
<i>his favorite student.</i>

03:05.602 --> 03:07.060
You know, these are bad for you.

03:07.228 --> 03:10.731
It leads to unwanted pregnancy,
all sorts of things.

03:10.899 --> 03:14.735
Mismatched tires on your vehicle,
which is nonexistent.

03:14.903 --> 03:19.198
<i>And here is where the trouble began.</i>
<i>The lie that started the whole thing.</i>

03:19.365 --> 03:23.243
Please, please, I'm begging you.
I will pay you. I'll pay you.

03:23.411 --> 03:25.245
Rhi, I cannot go camping
with you, okay?

03:25.413 --> 03:27.122
I'm sorry, but I have a date.

03:27.290 --> 03:29.917
- Okay? I told you.
- With who?

03:30.627 --> 03:33.420
- You don't know him.
- And neither do you, you selfish bitch.

03:33.588 --> 03:35.923
Yes, I do.
He goes to college with my brother.

03:36.090 --> 03:37.674
Okay. What's his name, then?

03:37.842 --> 03:40.677
<i>Rhiannon is what you'd call</i>
<i>a strong personality.</i>

03:40.845 --> 03:43.138
<i>She asked me to come camping</i>
<i>with her family...</i>

03:43.306 --> 03:45.224
<i>... and I don't know why</i>
<i>I didn't wanna go.</i>

03:45.391 --> 03:48.602
<i>A little because I didn't feel like</i>
<i>hanging out with her all weekend.</i>

03:48.770 --> 03:52.105
<i>But mostly because her parents are</i>
<i>the weirdest people I have ever met...</i>

03:52.273 --> 03:54.566
<i>... and I live in California.</i>

03:54.734 --> 03:57.277
<i>I ate dinner at her house once</i>
<i>and I swore, never again.</i>

03:57.445 --> 03:59.738
- This is interesting.
- Patchouli burger.

03:59.906 --> 04:01.990
We grew it in our victory garden.

04:02.158 --> 04:03.617
You want some dessert?

04:03.785 --> 04:06.245
No, thank you.
I'm trying to watch my figure.

04:06.412 --> 04:08.205
Well, I'm not.

04:09.332 --> 04:11.166
<i>So I lied and told her I couldn't go...</i>

04:11.334 --> 04:14.419
<i>... because I had a date with a friend</i>
<i>of my brother's named George.</i>

04:14.587 --> 04:17.673
Let's just face it, there is no such thing
as a sexy George.

04:17.839 --> 04:19.257
Yeah, well, mine is...

04:19.425 --> 04:22.928
...so I think we should just
put this conversation to bed.

04:23.096 --> 04:26.848
Fine, don't go camping with us.
Just know I hate you, bitch.

04:27.475 --> 04:29.351
Go get your chocolate milk.

04:30.478 --> 04:32.646
- Do you want one?
- No.

04:32.814 --> 04:35.440
<i>And here's how I really spent</i>
<i>the weekend.</i>

04:44.575 --> 04:46.451
That's the worst song ever.

05:32.749 --> 05:36.376
<i>But on Monday, when Rhi asked me</i>
<i>how my weekend was...</i>

05:36.544 --> 05:39.212
He was charming, you know?
He was a real gentleman.

05:39.380 --> 05:42.632
And it feels like I got a love
and I know that it's all mine.

05:42.800 --> 05:45.552
Okay, okay. Wait, wait.
So are you going to see him again?

05:45.720 --> 05:49.014
No. No, probably not. You know,
it was just one of those weekends.

05:49.182 --> 05:50.766
A whole weekend?

05:50.933 --> 05:52.434
Yup.

05:52.894 --> 05:55.562
- Wait a minute. You didn't have...?
- What?

05:55.897 --> 05:57.731
No. No, of course not.

05:57.899 --> 06:01.068
You liar.
You totally lost your V-card to him.

06:01.235 --> 06:02.861
- No, I didn't.
- Yes, you did.

06:03.029 --> 06:05.572
- Tell me everything.
- Rhi, I'm not that kind of girl.

06:05.740 --> 06:08.075
The kind that does it,
or the kind that does it...

06:08.242 --> 06:10.577
...and doesn't have the balls
to tell her friend?

06:10.745 --> 06:12.412
- What?
- I want every detail.

06:12.580 --> 06:13.914
- Rhi.
- Now, bitch.

06:14.082 --> 06:15.999
You know, you call me "bitch" a lot.
Okay?

06:16.167 --> 06:19.294
- It's not a term of endearment.
- I want every detail. Now, shitface.

06:19.462 --> 06:21.421
You're not heading
in the right direction.

06:21.589 --> 06:23.006
Tell me.

06:23.174 --> 06:24.758
Fine.

06:25.676 --> 06:27.302
We did it.

06:27.470 --> 06:28.595
Yes!

06:28.763 --> 06:31.056
Finally.
Now you're a super slut like me.

06:31.224 --> 06:33.683
I don't think letting Peter Hedlund
motorboat you...

06:33.851 --> 06:36.937
...behind a Bed Bath & Beyond
really makes you a super slut.

06:37.105 --> 06:40.399
There were a lot of people walking
past. Someone could've easily seen.

06:40.858 --> 06:44.277
Whatever. This isn't about me,
this is about you.

06:44.445 --> 06:45.487
What'd you let him do?

06:46.197 --> 06:50.575
It was normal. You know?
Nothing freaky.

06:50.743 --> 06:52.994
<i>I don't know why I did it.</i>

06:53.162 --> 06:55.622
<i>I guess maybe it was because</i>
<i>it was the first time...</i>

06:55.790 --> 06:58.250
<i>... I had sort of felt superior to Rhi.</i>

06:58.418 --> 07:01.795
<i>But I just started piling on lie after lie.</i>
<i>It was like setting up Jenga.</i>

07:01.963 --> 07:03.463
Do you know, like, Glade candles?

07:03.631 --> 07:06.967
Those kind, but they were, like,
sexy Glade candles.

07:07.135 --> 07:09.845
- He was sweet. He was...
- Of course.

07:14.809 --> 07:17.227
What the hell are you looking at,
Sister Christian?

07:17.395 --> 07:19.771
Just a couple of admitted whores.

07:22.024 --> 07:24.860
<i>Marianne Bryant is the secretary</i>
<i>of the student council...</i>

07:25.027 --> 07:27.446
<i>... chairman of the Orange Blossom</i>
<i>dance committee...</i>

07:27.613 --> 07:29.823
<i>... and president of</i>
<i>the Cross Your Heart Club...</i>

07:29.991 --> 07:33.034
<i>... a club dedicated to shoving</i>
<i>their beliefs down people's throats.</i>

07:33.202 --> 07:34.661
Obviously they don't care.

07:34.829 --> 07:37.789
<i>Last year's cause celebre was</i>
<i>the changing of the school mascot.</i>

07:40.334 --> 07:42.043
Give it up for your Blue Devils!

07:42.503 --> 07:44.212
Blue!

07:44.380 --> 07:46.756
Blue Devil!

07:49.177 --> 07:50.677
Yeah.

07:51.304 --> 07:53.680
Yeah!

07:54.849 --> 07:57.767
How can we exhibit school pride
when we're conveyed to others...

07:57.935 --> 07:59.561
...as Satan worshippers?

07:59.729 --> 08:03.190
<i>Now, thankfully,</i>
<i>we're the much less intimidating...</i>

08:04.525 --> 08:06.526
Give it up for the Woodchucks!

08:06.694 --> 08:08.987
Hey! Go, Woodchucks!

08:09.155 --> 08:11.448
Woodchucks!

08:17.955 --> 08:20.081
I liked Todd much better
when he was topless.

08:20.249 --> 08:23.418
Yeah, but even dressed as a
woodchuck, I still fantasize about him.

08:23.961 --> 08:25.212
Woodchucks.

08:27.924 --> 08:30.050
<i>Now Marianne had</i>
<i>a new cause celebre.</i>

08:30.635 --> 08:31.718
<i>Me.</i>

08:31.886 --> 08:34.346
Which brings us to part two.

08:34.514 --> 08:38.265
The accelerated velocity
of terminological inexactitude.

08:38.433 --> 08:43.104
<i>Which is really just my obnoxious way</i>
<i>of saying that lies travel fast.</i>

08:43.272 --> 08:47.901
<i>And, boy, did my terminological</i>
<i>inexactitude accelerate with velocity.</i>

08:48.069 --> 08:49.945
Did you hear about Olive?

09:10.800 --> 09:12.634
No way.

09:20.810 --> 09:23.103
- She's not a virgin anymore?
- I can't believe it.

09:23.271 --> 09:25.105
- Olive lost her virginity.
- Yeah.

09:26.357 --> 09:29.442
Maybe next time a certain somebody
will be a little more careful...

09:29.610 --> 09:31.319
...what she says in the water closet.

09:31.487 --> 09:34.614
Yeah, about that? It's...
That's actually not what you think.

09:34.782 --> 09:36.950
Can I talk to you alone
for a second?

09:37.118 --> 09:40.245
- You gonna be okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine. Thank you.

09:42.081 --> 09:44.165
Bye, Nina.

09:45.543 --> 09:49.170
What you heard in the bathroom
the other day wasn't true at all.

09:49.338 --> 09:52.799
- It's actually a funny story.
- Olive. That's your name, right?

09:53.217 --> 09:56.303
Yeah, yeah. And you're Marianne.

09:56.470 --> 09:58.847
We've had nine classes together
since kindergarten.

09:59.015 --> 10:02.017
Ten, if you count Religion
of Other Cultures, which you didn't...

10:02.184 --> 10:04.144
...because you refused to go.

10:04.312 --> 10:06.980
Yeah. Listen, I'm not the one
that you have to answer to...

10:07.148 --> 10:08.565
...for your depraved behavior.

10:08.733 --> 10:11.610
There's a higher power
that will judge you for your indecency.

10:11.777 --> 10:13.653
Tom Cruise?

10:13.863 --> 10:16.239
I hope for your sake
that God has a sense of humor.

10:16.407 --> 10:20.035
Oh, I have 17 years' worth
of anecdotal proof he does.

10:20.870 --> 10:22.120
You've made your bed.

10:22.288 --> 10:24.956
I just hope for your sake
that you've cleaned the sheets.

10:26.876 --> 10:28.668
- Did I just get saved?
- I missed you.

10:28.836 --> 10:30.003
Oh, you too.

10:30.171 --> 10:32.547
<i>So Marianne spread the rumor.</i>

10:32.715 --> 10:36.051
<i>For the first time ever, my sexual</i>
<i>exploits were the talk of the school.</i>

10:36.218 --> 10:38.678
<i>Oh, you know what? I'm wrong.</i>
<i>It was the second time.</i>

10:38.846 --> 10:40.847
<i>The first time was back</i>
<i>in 8th grade...</i>

10:41.015 --> 10:44.684
<i>... when all I wanted was a kiss from</i>
<i>this guy I had always had a crush on.</i>

10:44.852 --> 10:48.104
<i>Todd and I were thrown together</i>
<i>in Seven Minutes of Heaven.</i>

10:48.272 --> 10:52.942
<i>Luckily we had a super romantic</i>
<i>song from our youth to set the mood.</i>

10:54.737 --> 10:56.029
I think this is the part...

10:56.197 --> 10:58.865
...where you're supposed to
stick your tongue in my mouth.

10:59.033 --> 11:00.575
That's what I've heard, anyway.

11:00.743 --> 11:02.952
Just give me a second, okay?

11:03.120 --> 11:05.872
According to my watch,
you have 382 of them.

11:06.040 --> 11:07.290
- How do you do that?
- What?

11:07.458 --> 11:09.751
Add so fast.
And you also talk like a grown-up.

11:09.919 --> 11:13.213
Don't worry, I'm not nearly as smart
as I think I am.

11:14.548 --> 11:19.219
So if we didn't do anything,
could you still tell people we kissed?

11:22.056 --> 11:23.515
Absolutely.

11:23.974 --> 11:25.850
- Thanks, Olive.
- Sure, Todd.

11:27.103 --> 11:28.895
<i>I actually didn't wanna lie that time.</i>

11:29.063 --> 11:31.690
<i>When people thought</i>
<i>I'd kissed someone, they didn't care.</i>

11:31.857 --> 11:33.942
<i>But when they thought</i>
<i>I slept with someone...</i>

11:34.110 --> 11:36.569
Hey, Olive. How's it going?

11:36.737 --> 11:39.406
I'm swell,
Guy-I've-Never-Talked-to-Before.

11:39.573 --> 11:41.491
Thanks for asking.

11:42.118 --> 11:46.913
<i>All I could think to myself was,</i>
<i>"Great, now I'm a tramp."</i>

11:47.081 --> 11:49.082
<i>I'm gonna have to get</i>
<i>a lower-back tattoo...</i>

11:49.250 --> 11:51.543
<i>... and pierce something</i>
<i>not on my face.</i>

11:51.919 --> 11:54.212
You guys know that
I was here all weekend, right?

11:54.380 --> 11:55.797
- Yeah.
- Yes, you were upstairs.

11:55.965 --> 11:57.507
- Yeah.
- You would testify to that?

11:57.675 --> 11:59.634
- Yeah.
- I would take a bullet for you.

11:59.802 --> 12:01.553
You know that.
Right between the eyes.

12:01.721 --> 12:04.013
Man, I would slit my throat...

12:04.181 --> 12:06.099
...rather than say something
to someone...

12:06.267 --> 12:08.935
...that you didn't want me to say.
- That's not necessary.

12:09.103 --> 12:11.896
- But that is comforting.
- That's how I am, how I roll.

12:12.064 --> 12:13.815
That's how I do, as they say.

12:13.983 --> 12:17.527
- I like the pants.
- Thank you. They're Costco.

12:17.695 --> 12:19.571
You can have them
when you get taller.

12:19.739 --> 12:22.240
- I'm never gonna go through puberty.
- Course you will.

12:22.408 --> 12:24.284
But we're a family of late bloomers.

12:24.452 --> 12:27.203
I didn't until I was 14. Nor did Olive.

12:27.371 --> 12:29.289
Why does that matter? I'm adopted.

12:29.707 --> 12:33.168
What? Oh, my God. Who told you?

12:33.627 --> 12:36.713
Guys, we were gonna do this
at the right time.

12:36.881 --> 12:37.922
Listen to me.

12:38.090 --> 12:41.217
Sometimes, even when a man and
a woman love each other very much...

12:41.385 --> 12:43.052
...like your mother and I used to...

12:43.220 --> 12:45.930
...their insides just don't cooperate
with each other.

12:46.098 --> 12:47.348
So, what's going on, honey?

12:47.516 --> 12:50.643
Why do you want us to take a bullet
if anyone asks if you were here?

12:50.811 --> 12:53.146
It's nothing. It's just the rumor mill.

12:53.314 --> 12:56.483
What's the rumor mill churning out
these days? Anything interesting?

12:56.650 --> 12:59.694
You know, not really. Not really.
It's a little low on grist.

12:59.862 --> 13:02.655
Clever wordplay. I like it.
You must be related to me.

13:02.823 --> 13:04.991
- Only by marriage.
- Give it to me.

13:05.159 --> 13:07.494
So, what we're all gonna take away
from this:

13:07.661 --> 13:10.371
- I was here all weekend, right?
- Yes, yes, yes.

13:11.248 --> 13:13.833
<i>Remember how I told you</i>
<i>Google Earth couldn't find me...</i>

13:14.001 --> 13:16.127
<i>... if I was dressed up</i>
<i>as a ten-story building?</i>

13:16.295 --> 13:20.089
<i>Well, the next day it could find me if I
<i>was dressed as a crack on a sidewalk.</i></i>

13:20.257 --> 13:22.509
<i>That's the beauty of being</i>
<i>a girl in high school.</i>

13:22.676 --> 13:26.179
<i>People hear you had sex once</i>
<i>and, bam, you're a bimbo.</i>

13:26.347 --> 13:28.890
<i>I really didn't mean for the lie</i>
<i>to put me on the map...</i>

13:29.058 --> 13:32.227
<i>... but I gotta admit,</i>
<i>I kind of liked being on the map.</i>

13:32.394 --> 13:36.648
So, clearly Nathaniel Hawthorne
is a complex writer.

13:36.816 --> 13:38.441
Even I had trouble with him.

13:38.609 --> 13:41.694
I read him originally when I was 5,
but I struggled.

13:41.862 --> 13:44.823
So I'm gonna break it down for you.
I'm gonna throw some rhymes.

13:44.990 --> 13:46.991
Anson, drop me a beat.

13:47.159 --> 13:48.868
- What?
- Give me a beat.

13:49.036 --> 13:50.912
Push it up.

13:51.789 --> 13:54.666
<i>Yeah, adultery, vengeance</i>

13:54.834 --> 13:57.168
<i>Crimes of passion</i>

13:57.336 --> 13:59.379
Kill the beat.
I'm not gonna rap for you.

13:59.547 --> 14:01.589
It's pandering
and it's been done before...

14:01.757 --> 14:04.884
...in every bad movie
you've ever seen. Okay.

14:05.052 --> 14:07.679
<i>Ironically, we were studying</i>
The Scarlet Letter.

14:07.847 --> 14:09.722
<i>Now, isn't that always the way?</i>

14:09.890 --> 14:13.059
<i>The books you read in class always</i>
<i>have some strong connection...</i>

14:13.227 --> 14:16.062
<i>... with whatever angsty</i>
<i>adolescent drama is going on.</i>

14:16.230 --> 14:19.190
Except for Huckleberry Finn.
<i>I don't know any teenage boys...</i>

14:19.358 --> 14:21.943
<i>... who have ever run away</i>
<i>with a big, hulking black guy.</i>

14:22.361 --> 14:24.571
For those who haven't read
<i>The Scarlet Letter...</i>

14:24.738 --> 14:28.408
...or for those who said you did
but didn't, here's all you need to know.

14:28.576 --> 14:31.411
<i>This girl, Hester Prynne,</i>
<i>has an affair with a minister...</i>

14:31.579 --> 14:35.415
<i>... is besmirched and made to wear</i>
<i>a red A for "adulterer."</i>

14:35.583 --> 14:37.876
<i>The town realizes</i>
<i>she was too harshly judged...</i>

14:38.043 --> 14:40.920
<i>... and she's really a good person,</i>
<i>and she dies a saint.</i>

14:41.088 --> 14:42.922
<i>A whole bunch</i>
<i>of other stuff happens too.</i>

14:43.090 --> 14:46.634
If you have a test on it, rent the movie,
but make sure it's the original...

14:46.802 --> 14:50.430
...not the Demi Moore version where
she talks in a fake British accent...

14:50.598 --> 14:52.348
...and takes a lot of baths.

14:52.516 --> 14:57.437
To say that one was freely adapted
is a bit of an understatement, guvnor.

14:57.605 --> 14:59.606
What we have to realize...

14:59.773 --> 15:03.067
...is that Hester lived
in an entirely different time.

15:03.235 --> 15:09.449
A time when the worst crime a woman
could commit was in fact adultery.

15:10.242 --> 15:11.284
Nina.

15:11.452 --> 15:13.411
I think Hester Prynne was...

15:13.579 --> 15:16.122
Excuse my language... . A skank.

15:16.290 --> 15:18.750
A skank? So you don't think
she was a victim at all?

15:18.918 --> 15:21.127
Why should I?
She brought it on herself.

15:22.463 --> 15:26.966
Perhaps you should embroider a red A
on your wardrobe, abominable tramp.

15:27.134 --> 15:30.970
Perhaps you should get a wardrobe,
you abominable twat.

15:32.640 --> 15:35.141
<i>Not my best line,</i>
<i>but it was provocative enough...</i>

15:35.309 --> 15:37.810
<i>... to land me in the principal's office.</i>

15:43.359 --> 15:47.654
Seems as if someone's
on a downward spiral.

15:48.030 --> 15:51.366
Seems as if someone's
practicing the mundane activities...

15:51.533 --> 15:53.701
...she'll be saddled with
the rest of her life.

15:53.869 --> 15:56.663
I hope you at least had the good sense
to use protection.

15:56.830 --> 15:58.289
Why? Your parents didn't.

15:58.457 --> 16:01.167
- You're going to hell.
- Just as long as you won't be there.

16:01.335 --> 16:03.169
I can assure you I won't.

16:03.754 --> 16:05.672
Good.

16:10.177 --> 16:14.055
I don't care who started it.
Just work it out.

16:18.644 --> 16:19.686
Penderghast.

16:21.188 --> 16:23.898
So why am I just meeting you?

16:24.066 --> 16:26.651
Language like this would've
warranted a visit years ago.

16:26.819 --> 16:30.863
This is the first time I've done anything
remotely misbehavioral.

16:31.031 --> 16:32.156
This is foul.

16:32.324 --> 16:34.575
I know. I am so...
I'm really, really sorry.

16:34.743 --> 16:37.036
Sorry you said it
or sorry you got caught?

16:37.204 --> 16:39.163
Sorry I said it, honestly.

16:39.331 --> 16:42.959
And sorry I got caught a little bit too,
but mostly just sorry I said it.

16:43.127 --> 16:47.046
If you use a word like this again in my
school, it'll be your last. Understand?

16:47.214 --> 16:48.256
Yes, sir. Yes.

16:48.424 --> 16:50.883
I mean, this isn't one of
those progressive schools...

16:51.051 --> 16:53.553
...where teachers are called
by their first names...

16:53.721 --> 16:56.347
...and students
are partners in learning...

16:56.515 --> 16:59.475
...and there's a fundraising auction
at the end of the year...

16:59.643 --> 17:02.895
...where the more creative parents
put on musical skits...

17:03.063 --> 17:05.064
...about the community garden.

17:05.733 --> 17:07.942
This is public school.

17:08.109 --> 17:12.530
If I can keep the girls off the pole and
the boys off the pipe, I get a bonus.

17:12.698 --> 17:15.241
Now, if you're sent to me
one more time...

17:15.409 --> 17:18.786
...you're gonna be out on your fantail.
Now, am I making myself clear?

17:18.954 --> 17:20.079
Yes, sir.

17:20.955 --> 17:22.040
- Good.
- I think so.

17:22.207 --> 17:26.127
I mean, I got a little lost in the middle,
but I found my way back.

17:26.295 --> 17:28.087
Detention after school tomorrow.

17:28.255 --> 17:31.257
Now, out.

17:32.926 --> 17:36.971
<i>Even though it was my slutty alter ego</i>
<i>that said a bad word in school...</i>

17:37.139 --> 17:39.390
<i>... it was my ass that got in trouble...</i>

17:39.558 --> 17:42.560
<i>... which was a place my ass</i>
<i>had never been before.</i>

17:47.608 --> 17:49.192
Hey, Olive.

17:49.526 --> 17:52.153
Oh, my God. The illusion is shattered.

17:52.321 --> 17:55.782
They put you in the gas chamber if you
take your head off at Disney World.

17:55.949 --> 17:58.618
I think they just fire you.
You're thinking of Disneyland.

17:58.786 --> 18:00.620
- Disney World is more liberal.
- Oh, yeah.

18:00.788 --> 18:03.664
I always forget Disney World
went blue in the last election.

18:03.832 --> 18:05.708
Are you going
to Melody Bostic's party?

18:05.959 --> 18:07.460
I hadn't planned on it.

18:07.628 --> 18:10.671
Me neither. My cousin's getting
married. It's a rehearsal dinner.

18:10.839 --> 18:13.466
See you. Stay excellent.

18:13.967 --> 18:14.967
You too.

18:15.135 --> 18:16.427
- What's up, kid?
- Woodchuck.

18:18.055 --> 18:19.931
Please tell me the rumors are true.

18:20.099 --> 18:22.558
Yes. Yes. I am a big, fat slut.

18:22.726 --> 18:26.187
No, the one where you got suspended
for calling Nina Howell a dick...

18:26.355 --> 18:28.439
...and punching her in the left tit.

18:29.149 --> 18:32.110
I worry about the way information
circulates at this school.

18:32.778 --> 18:35.446
Rhi? I need to tell you something.

18:35.614 --> 18:38.491
Like the exact moment
you turned into such a badass?

18:38.659 --> 18:40.493
- I think I'm in love with you.
- Okay.

18:40.661 --> 18:43.329
Tell me you left a mark
on that scrunched-up face of hers?

18:43.497 --> 18:45.331
- It's not true.
- It wasn't the left tit?

18:45.499 --> 18:48.334
It was the right one.
I always pegged you for a southpaw.

18:48.502 --> 18:51.087
Can you listen to me
for one second, please?

18:51.255 --> 18:54.465
Okay. It didn't happen.

18:54.633 --> 18:58.511
Oh, yeah, right. Your secret's safe
with me, you little sex monkey.

19:03.100 --> 19:05.143
I got sent to the principal today.

19:05.310 --> 19:07.395
Did you win a medal or something?

19:07.563 --> 19:08.604
Not exactly.

19:08.772 --> 19:13.359
I used inappropriate language
in English class.

19:13.527 --> 19:16.529
Although we're reading a book
that I personally deem...

19:16.697 --> 19:20.533
...inappropriate for our age group,
so I actually felt it was quite apropos.

19:20.701 --> 19:21.951
What did you say?

19:23.996 --> 19:26.205
Let's just say
it was an inappropriate word.

19:26.373 --> 19:27.707
Well, what did it start with?

19:27.875 --> 19:30.251
A snide comment
from a snotty girl in my class.

19:30.419 --> 19:33.796
No, I mean what letter
did the word start with?

19:33.964 --> 19:35.590
<i>- T.</i>
- Oh, T.

19:35.757 --> 19:40.219
- T? Let us think. T, T, T.
- T. All right, T. Yeah, T.

19:40.387 --> 19:44.724
- T, T, T.
- T, T, T.

19:55.736 --> 19:57.737
- Guys.
- Noun, adjective or verb?

19:57.905 --> 20:01.032
Noun. It's definitely slang.
Think British.

20:01.200 --> 20:03.075
Tallywhacker? Termagant?

20:06.747 --> 20:08.831
You're just saying sounds.
Those are sounds.

20:08.999 --> 20:11.918
- Spell it with your peas.
- Yeah, spell it with your peas. Do it.

20:12.085 --> 20:13.753
- I will take that challenge.
- Do it.

20:13.921 --> 20:15.254
I like that. All right.

20:15.422 --> 20:17.715
So does this have anything to do
with the rumor...

20:17.883 --> 20:19.926
...that you mentioned the other night?

20:20.093 --> 20:23.387
Do you need to talk to us
about something, sweetie?

20:23.555 --> 20:25.514
What's a twit?

20:25.682 --> 20:27.433
That's an A, honey.

20:27.601 --> 20:29.852
It'll get you sent
to the principal's office.

20:30.020 --> 20:31.187
Sit down.

20:31.355 --> 20:33.898
We're lucky that this
is not a common occurrence.

20:34.066 --> 20:36.108
What would my punishment
have been otherwise?

20:36.276 --> 20:39.862
- Bed without supper, I guess.
- But I'm already finished.

20:40.697 --> 20:43.282
- No dating. No dating.
- Yeah, no dating.

20:43.450 --> 20:45.451
- No dating for you, young lady.
- No dating.

20:45.619 --> 20:47.870
I think my complete lack of allure...

20:48.038 --> 20:50.623
...already kind of
shot that horse in the face.

20:50.791 --> 20:53.960
I wouldn't know how to be grounded
more than you know how to ground.

20:54.127 --> 20:56.462
That's right. Love you. Come here.

20:56.630 --> 21:00.341
And I bet that girl was acting
like exactly what you called her.

21:00.509 --> 21:01.634
Oh, you have no idea.

21:03.804 --> 21:06.305
I got a B-plus
on my spelling test today.

21:06.473 --> 21:10.059
That's good, honey, but everything
has spell check these days, so...

21:10.227 --> 21:11.394
Just kidding.

21:13.647 --> 21:15.564
Where are you from originally?

21:16.066 --> 21:17.692
<i>So the next day I had detention...</i>

21:17.859 --> 21:21.153
<i>... which, thanks to recent budget cuts,</i>
<i>meant cleaning.</i>

21:21.321 --> 21:23.739
<i>I was looking forward to</i>
<i>getting all this behind me.</i>

21:23.907 --> 21:26.492
<i>I had done the crime.</i>
<i>I was gonna do the time.</i>

21:26.660 --> 21:28.869
<i>And that would be that,</i>
<i>but that...</i>

21:29.037 --> 21:31.831
Aren't there, like,
child labor laws against this?

21:31.999 --> 21:33.124
Not in high school.

21:33.292 --> 21:37.461
The principal's like the captain
of the ship in international waters.

21:37.629 --> 21:39.255
He can even marry people.

21:40.299 --> 21:42.925
We haven't talked in a while.
How have you been, Brandon?

21:43.093 --> 21:46.762
Fabulous. I'm crushing it.
Everything according to plan.

21:46.930 --> 21:48.931
I wanna be in detention.

21:49.099 --> 21:50.349
Yeah, why are you here?

21:50.517 --> 21:53.978
From the blood I saw gushing out of
your nose, I thought you were bullied.

21:54.146 --> 21:57.523
Principal Gibbons is a homophobe,
which is why I called him a fascist.

21:57.691 --> 22:01.027
- So the rumors are true.
- I don't know what you're talking about.

22:01.194 --> 22:03.821
I meant about
Gibbons being a fascist.

22:05.449 --> 22:08.367
So, what's with your new look?
Very whore couture.

22:08.535 --> 22:11.871
Oh, haven't you heard?
I'm the new school slut.

22:12.039 --> 22:15.624
You know, I did hear something.
I also heard he was twice your age.

22:15.792 --> 22:18.377
Oh, no, no, no.
No, he was a freshman in college.

22:18.545 --> 22:20.671
I also heard he gave you crabs.

22:20.839 --> 22:23.549
- People suck.
- Tell me about it.

22:26.011 --> 22:27.136
He's not real.

22:28.638 --> 22:31.891
- What?
- The guy I slept with. I made him up.

22:32.059 --> 22:34.060
Wait, you started the rumor?

22:34.227 --> 22:36.270
Indirectly, I guess sort of.

22:36.438 --> 22:40.733
Or actually, no.
No, not really. No, I didn't.

22:40.901 --> 22:43.861
Well, but you're perpetuating it.
That's really messed up.

22:44.029 --> 22:45.154
Excuse me?

22:45.322 --> 22:48.407
You're not even a real slut.
You just want people to think you are.

22:48.575 --> 22:50.076
It's pathetic.

22:50.243 --> 22:55.081
No offense, but you could probably
learn something from me, Brando.

22:55.248 --> 22:59.960
Are you saying that I should
act straight so people will like me?

23:00.128 --> 23:03.923
That's groundbreaking. You should
teach a course at The Learning Annex.

23:04.091 --> 23:07.176
It could be called "The Painfully
Obvious with Olive Penderghast...

23:07.344 --> 23:08.636
...the Fake School Slut."

23:08.804 --> 23:11.931
I was just suggesting that
maybe these kids we call peers...

23:12.099 --> 23:14.767
...are onto something.
You know, like Marianne Bryant.

23:14.935 --> 23:19.897
Maybe that whole stuck-up,
Jesus-freak thing is an act. You know?

23:20.065 --> 23:22.441
No, I think she's just
a stuck-up Jesus freak.

23:22.609 --> 23:25.861
And there are some of us who are
just trying to blend in to the crowd.

23:26.029 --> 23:29.031
Well, then you've gotta do
everything you can to blend in...

23:29.199 --> 23:30.950
...or decide not to care.

23:31.618 --> 23:34.870
I can't decide if you're a genius
or a lunatic.

23:35.038 --> 23:39.041
Well, don't they sort of go
hand in hand?

23:40.836 --> 23:43.921
- So you heard any word from George?
- Nope.

23:44.089 --> 23:48.801
I told you, that was a one-night stand,
which is now over.

23:48.969 --> 23:51.053
You're being pretty cavalier
about this.

23:51.221 --> 23:53.639
Aren't you supposed to be
eternally in love with him?

23:53.807 --> 23:57.476
Yes, I believe so. If I was a Gossip Girl
in Sweet Valley with traveling pants.

23:57.644 --> 24:01.981
But no, I'm not.
So I could really care less.

24:02.149 --> 24:04.316
So Brandy Carter
was telling Vanessa Hodges...

24:04.484 --> 24:07.319
...that you were with three guys
in a Jacuzzi.

24:07.988 --> 24:09.405
Sounds like a lot of work.

24:09.573 --> 24:13.117
I guess that's still better than
getting it on with some old dude.

24:13.285 --> 24:14.618
Who said that?

24:14.786 --> 24:18.747
Do you know that Brandon kid?
That's what somebody told him.

24:18.915 --> 24:19.999
Isn't he a homo?

24:20.792 --> 24:22.001
Yeah.

24:28.091 --> 24:29.967
Speak of the devil. Hello.

24:30.135 --> 24:32.845
I was just talking about you
with my friend, Rhiannon.

24:33.013 --> 24:36.432
You know Rhiannon.
She's perpetually angry.

24:36.600 --> 24:38.684
She curses like a Somali sailor. Bi...

24:38.852 --> 24:41.312
- Yeah. That's the one.
- "Bi..."? "Bi..."? What's "bi-"?

24:41.480 --> 24:44.148
- Okay.
- I wanna know what "bi..." is.

24:44.316 --> 24:46.025
Hello, what's "bi..."? What is "bi..."?

24:46.193 --> 24:48.277
- Bye.
- "Bi..."? What is "bi..."?

24:48.445 --> 24:51.447
Bedazzling personality?
Beautiful, beautiful soul?

24:51.615 --> 24:54.200
- Big tits.
- That's my identifier?

24:55.118 --> 24:56.619
Yes!

24:56.786 --> 25:00.539
All right, well, that was Brandon. He
needs to talk to me about something.

25:00.707 --> 25:03.584
- Probably wants to borrow an outfit.
- Whatever, Big Tits.

25:03.752 --> 25:05.294
Heck, yeah!

25:06.046 --> 25:07.880
Big tits!

25:08.048 --> 25:10.841
The next day,
things took a turn for the scandalous...

25:11.009 --> 25:12.968
...which brings us to part three.

25:13.136 --> 25:16.889
A lady's choice
and a gentleman's agreement.

25:30.529 --> 25:32.905
Hi. Is there an Olive here?

25:33.073 --> 25:35.241
There's a whole jar of them
in the fridge.

25:35.408 --> 25:37.576
I'm sorry,
I must have the wrong address.

25:37.744 --> 25:39.078
Just kidding. Come on in.

25:40.038 --> 25:43.165
Any friend of Olive's
is a friend of our daughter's.

25:43.792 --> 25:45.334
Olive, sweetie.

25:45.502 --> 25:47.586
There's a young man
here to see you.

25:47.754 --> 25:51.423
He said something about asking
for your hand in marriage.

25:51.591 --> 25:53.884
Oh, happy day, Mama!

25:54.052 --> 25:56.387
Oh, I thought I was gonna have
to spend my dowry...

25:56.555 --> 25:59.390
...on booze and pills
to numb the Ioneliness.

25:59.558 --> 26:01.892
A gentleman caller, hurray!

26:02.060 --> 26:04.395
- What's that?
- Olive has a boy in her room.

26:04.563 --> 26:05.729
- A boy?
- A boy.

26:05.897 --> 26:08.107
- Wow, a boy.
- A boy.

26:08.275 --> 26:09.942
A boy?

26:10.110 --> 26:11.944
A boy.

26:13.071 --> 26:16.448
Welcome.
This is where the magic happens.

26:16.616 --> 26:18.284
And by magic I mean nothing.

26:18.451 --> 26:20.077
- Do you wanna go out with me?
- What?

26:20.245 --> 26:22.913
Well, I mean, like,
do you wanna be my girlfriend?

26:25.041 --> 26:28.544
Brandon, just a couple hours ago
you told me you were Kinsey Six gay.

26:28.712 --> 26:31.463
True, but you said I should
pretend to be straight, so...

26:31.631 --> 26:33.465
Yeah, I didn't mean with me.

26:33.633 --> 26:38.596
I mean, you're a nice guy and all,
but you're not really my type.

26:38.763 --> 26:40.556
Yeah, you're not really
my type either.

26:40.724 --> 26:43.642
Yeah, I know that. I got that V
where you'd rather see a P.

26:43.810 --> 26:45.477
Do you wanna
have sex with me or not?

26:45.645 --> 26:47.605
Oh, my God, dude.

26:47.772 --> 26:49.231
You completely missed the point.

26:49.399 --> 26:52.151
- That's not what I was saying.
- I know what you were saying.

26:52.319 --> 26:54.820
I should act straight
till I get out of this hellhole.

26:54.988 --> 26:57.156
Then I can be whoever I wanna be.
I get that.

26:57.324 --> 27:00.159
You know that I didn't have sex
with a college guy, right?

27:00.327 --> 27:02.077
I just told everybody I did.

27:02.245 --> 27:05.831
Actually, I told one person I did.
And you know how these things work.

27:05.999 --> 27:07.166
It's like wildfire.

27:07.709 --> 27:10.919
So you're saying
I shouldn't really have sex?

27:11.087 --> 27:14.798
I should just say I had sex
with someone. A girl.

27:14.966 --> 27:17.343
Yes. Yes.

27:24.768 --> 27:26.352
Oh, no.

27:26.603 --> 27:29.730
- Wai... Just...
- Oh, no, no, no.

27:30.315 --> 27:33.025
- No way! No way!
- Just wait. Wait, wait. Stop it, stop it.

27:33.193 --> 27:35.527
- Absolutely not.
- Think about it. Think about it.

27:35.695 --> 27:37.946
- We could help each other out.
- No.

27:38.114 --> 27:40.699
You wanna maintain
this floozy facade.

27:40.867 --> 27:44.036
I don't wanna get pushed into shit
every day. It's a win-win-win.

27:44.204 --> 27:46.372
How do you know I like
being thought of as a floozy?

27:46.539 --> 27:48.624
Because at least
you're being thought of.

27:48.792 --> 27:51.835
Just one good imaginary bonk.

27:52.003 --> 27:54.546
You are on crack. All right?
And not the good kind.

27:54.714 --> 27:56.048
It doesn't have to be a bonk.

27:56.216 --> 27:58.717
It could be an imaginary butterbean,
lemon squeeze...

27:58.885 --> 28:02.096
- I don't know what any of that means.
- That's because you're a virgin.

28:02.263 --> 28:04.390
You know what?
This is not the answer at all.

28:04.557 --> 28:07.643
- I'll pay you whatever you want.
- I don't want your money, Brandon.

28:07.811 --> 28:09.812
Just do what I did
and make someone up.

28:09.979 --> 28:11.855
Who's going to believe me?

28:13.650 --> 28:17.820
You don't understand how hard it is,
all right? I'm tormented.

28:17.987 --> 28:22.199
And every day at school
is like I'm being suffocated.

28:22.367 --> 28:24.743
And sure, we can sit
and fantasize all we want...

28:24.911 --> 28:27.371
...about how things
are gonna be different one day...

28:27.539 --> 28:29.415
...but this is today and it sucks.

28:29.582 --> 28:32.793
There's only one way around it.
You were smart enough to think of it.

28:32.961 --> 28:35.546
So please, just help me.

28:35.714 --> 28:39.383
Because I can't take another day
of this. I don't know what I'll do.

28:47.225 --> 28:49.768
I don't do anything half-assed.
All right?

28:49.936 --> 28:51.437
It'll have to be a public event.

28:51.604 --> 28:54.022
Melody Bostic is throwing
a party tomorrow night.

28:54.190 --> 28:58.110
All of your tormentors will be there.
You and I are going together. All right?

28:58.278 --> 29:02.448
You have to do everything I say and
tell everyone that I am sensational.

29:02.615 --> 29:05.743
- Thank you so much for doing this.
- Just...

29:06.369 --> 29:09.580
...you know, make sure you're ready
to live with the consequences.

29:10.790 --> 29:14.710
- What the hell is a lemon squeeze?
- It's like a backwards melon bag.

29:14.878 --> 29:17.921
How don't I know any of this?

29:19.591 --> 29:22.468
<i>The next night was the party</i>
<i>at Melody Bostic's house.</i>

29:22.635 --> 29:24.970
<i>She is the most popular girl</i>
<i>in school.</i>

29:25.138 --> 29:27.681
<i>It's partly because she's pretty</i>
<i>and has perfect hair...</i>

29:27.849 --> 29:30.768
<i>... but mostly because her parents</i>
<i>let her have these parties...</i>

29:30.935 --> 29:33.395
<i>... every time she catches them</i>
<i>doing it in the pool...</i>

29:33.563 --> 29:36.690
<i>... which is every week, apparently.</i>

29:36.858 --> 29:39.818
<i>Brandon and I showed up</i>
<i>when it was in full swing.</i>

29:39.986 --> 29:43.113
<i>I borrowed a dress from my mom,</i>
<i>Brandon borrowed a jacket from me...</i>

29:43.281 --> 29:45.199
<i>... and we put on a little show.</i>

29:45.366 --> 29:48.035
Hey, Olive and Brandon.

29:48.203 --> 29:49.495
What's up?

29:49.662 --> 29:53.040
I hope you don't mind, but we had
a few pre-cocktail-party cocktails...

29:53.208 --> 29:56.293
...like, before the cocktail party
with cocktails.

29:58.046 --> 30:01.131
Listen, here's the sitch,
Melody Bostic.

30:01.883 --> 30:05.928
Brandon was just in the middle
of telling me this really funny thing...

30:06.095 --> 30:07.262
...which is really funny.

30:07.430 --> 30:11.225
And I was wondering if there's,
like, a room where we could go...

30:11.392 --> 30:14.686
...where he could finish telling me
that thing that's funny...

30:14.854 --> 30:16.146
...if you know what I mean.

30:16.314 --> 30:17.606
You can use my room.

30:18.775 --> 30:20.526
Down the hall to the left.

30:21.778 --> 30:24.029
Cool.

30:25.156 --> 30:27.282
Is that Olive with Brandon?

30:27.450 --> 30:29.368
I know. What the hell, right?

30:29.536 --> 30:31.245
You guys are my buddies.

30:31.412 --> 30:33.038
I'm drunk, bitches. What's up?

30:33.206 --> 30:34.706
I love your room!

30:34.874 --> 30:37.209
My sheets. Put a towel down.

30:37.377 --> 30:41.088
- Olive's gonna do a gay dude.
- Thanks. Close the shades.

30:45.885 --> 30:47.302
- What are you doing?
- Relax.

30:47.470 --> 30:51.139
Jesus, what is with you gays? Are you
really that repulsed by lady parts?

30:51.307 --> 30:53.559
What do you think I have down there,
a gnome?

30:59.566 --> 31:03.652
So nice. What is that, lavender?
It's pretty.

31:03.820 --> 31:06.530
What are you doing? Can you...?
Can you come here, please?

31:06.698 --> 31:08.866
Jacket off. Come on.

31:09.033 --> 31:12.661
All right. Come on.
Chop-chop. All right.

31:12.829 --> 31:15.205
Now grunt.
Grunt and make it convincing.

31:17.125 --> 31:19.918
I said grunt, not whine. Just grunt.

31:24.090 --> 31:26.592
Moan, you know? Like, sex noises.

31:28.595 --> 31:29.761
God, you are pathetic.

31:37.562 --> 31:39.438
Good. Good.

31:41.774 --> 31:44.151
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

31:44.360 --> 31:46.111
Oh, yeah.

31:46.279 --> 31:48.572
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, yeah.

31:52.577 --> 31:55.245
- You don't have to be so aggressive.
- You don't like that?

31:55.413 --> 31:57.456
- No, I don't like that.
- You don't like that?

31:57.624 --> 31:58.916
How about that?

31:59.083 --> 32:00.918
- Little better.
- Yeah, you like that.

32:01.085 --> 32:02.794
I like that.

32:02.962 --> 32:05.923
- This guy, he's gay, no?
- I think he's gay.

32:06.090 --> 32:08.592
- Don't stop!
- Keep going.

32:08.760 --> 32:10.969
- Don't stop.
- I'm not gonna stop.

32:11.137 --> 32:12.429
I'm not gonna stop.

32:12.597 --> 32:13.972
Now you try. You try.

32:14.140 --> 32:18.310
I'm gonna turn you around
and take you from the back.

32:18.478 --> 32:20.979
That's not gonna make people
think you're straight.

32:21.147 --> 32:25.317
Never mind that gayness
because I'm a straight guy. Roar!

32:28.821 --> 32:31.323
Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!

32:31.491 --> 32:33.659
- That's awesome! That's perfect!
- Yeah!

32:33.826 --> 32:35.452
That's what I'm talking about!

32:35.828 --> 32:38.956
Do you smell that?
Do you smell us?

32:39.832 --> 32:41.833
Did he just say it smelled?

32:43.670 --> 32:45.003
Isn't it supposed to smell?

32:45.171 --> 32:46.964
You're not supposed
to comment on it.

32:47.131 --> 32:51.593
- It doesn't really smell that bad.
- Oh, yeah. Yes, God!

32:51.761 --> 32:54.805
- Don't stop. Yeah!
- Don't stop. It's too much fun.

32:54.973 --> 32:57.099
- You ready for the grand finale?
- Yeah. What?

32:58.726 --> 33:02.562
Oh, yeah.

33:02.855 --> 33:03.939
Yeah.

33:07.986 --> 33:09.987
Come on.

33:10.154 --> 33:11.822
Oh, my God.

33:14.450 --> 33:17.661
Go forth, my son.
You're a man now.

33:19.205 --> 33:20.330
Hey.

33:21.833 --> 33:23.000
Thank you.

33:26.129 --> 33:29.131
Seriously, thanks.

33:37.807 --> 33:38.849
- Here.
- What is this?

33:39.183 --> 33:40.267
Evidence.

33:45.440 --> 33:48.650
What's up?

33:53.573 --> 33:55.198
Hey, man.

33:55.742 --> 33:56.742
How was she?

33:56.909 --> 34:01.997
Well, well, let's just say
I'll be walking funny tomorrow.

34:02.165 --> 34:03.999
What?

34:04.667 --> 34:07.252
- I'm drunk. What's up, bitches?
- Yeah!

34:19.056 --> 34:21.766
- Whoa, hey.
- Todd, hi.

34:21.934 --> 34:24.393
I thought you were at
your cousin's rehearsal dinner.

34:24.562 --> 34:27.272
It was a quick rehearsal.
I only had one line.

34:27.940 --> 34:28.940
That was a joke.

34:29.984 --> 34:31.568
I know.

34:31.819 --> 34:33.862
Yeah, sorry. How's it going?

34:34.655 --> 34:36.782
You know, I'm...

34:37.324 --> 34:39.117
- I'm here.
- Can I get you a beer?

34:39.284 --> 34:41.620
That rhymed. I liked it.

34:42.080 --> 34:43.538
Yeah.

34:52.882 --> 34:54.966
- I'm gonna go.
- You sure?

34:55.134 --> 34:59.137
- Yeah. Bye.
- See you at the salt mines.

34:59.472 --> 35:01.139
<i>Maybe this is gonna sound stupid...</i>

35:01.307 --> 35:04.726
...and, believe me, it's not like
I was expecting, you know, fireworks...

35:04.894 --> 35:07.437
...or a string quartet or anything...

35:08.356 --> 35:11.024
...but I always thought pretending
to lose my virginity...

35:11.192 --> 35:12.943
...would be a little more...

35:13.111 --> 35:15.237
...I don't know, special?

35:16.322 --> 35:19.032
Judy Blume should've
prepared me for that.

35:26.666 --> 35:28.125
That is so beautiful.

35:28.292 --> 35:29.751
Never had one lesson.

35:29.919 --> 35:32.379
That boy from yesterday
just dropped this off for you.

35:32.547 --> 35:36.800
Well, put it in the pile of gifts
from my other suitors.

35:36.968 --> 35:39.761
- Thanks.
- He seems like a nice kid.

35:39.929 --> 35:41.972
He seemed a little incredibly gay.

35:42.140 --> 35:44.599
A dyed-in-the-wool homosexual,
that boy is.

35:44.767 --> 35:48.019
I just want you to know
your father and I are totally supportive.

35:48.187 --> 35:50.564
We love you no matter
what the sexual orientation...

35:50.731 --> 35:52.440
...of your opposite-sex sex partner.

35:52.608 --> 35:53.859
We're not dating, Mom.

35:54.026 --> 35:56.820
And don't worry about
not making us grandparents...

35:56.988 --> 35:59.906
...although we were kind of hoping
you'd get knocked up...

36:00.074 --> 36:02.450
...so we'd have a second shot
at raising kids.

36:02.618 --> 36:04.828
Really do it right this time.

36:04.996 --> 36:08.165
- Bye now.
- I dated a homosexual once.

36:08.332 --> 36:11.543
For a long time, actually.
A long time.

36:11.711 --> 36:15.422
Dear God, dear Lord, tell me you did
not marry and have children with him.

36:15.590 --> 36:17.132
No.

36:17.300 --> 36:18.341
No, no, no.

36:18.509 --> 36:20.552
Your father is as straight
as they come.

36:20.720 --> 36:23.054
A little too straight,
if you know what I mean.

36:23.222 --> 36:25.724
I don't. Can you shut the door, please?

36:28.853 --> 36:31.438
Okay, door's right over there.
Keep going.

36:31.606 --> 36:35.984
- Take it down.
- Go take that out to Dad. Nice.

36:42.617 --> 36:46.745
"Just in case you don't shop at Target.
Then you can go screw yourself.

36:46.913 --> 36:48.496
Brandon."

36:56.589 --> 36:57.631
Hi, Rhi.

36:57.798 --> 37:01.051
Is it true you got with Brandon
at Melody Dipshit's party?

37:01.802 --> 37:03.637
Is that what people
are saying happened?

37:03.804 --> 37:06.765
<i>That's what everyone</i>
<i>is saying happened.</i>

37:06.933 --> 37:09.809
Well, then I guess that...
I guess that's true.

37:09.977 --> 37:12.896
Just because you lost your virginity
doesn't mean you can go...

37:13.064 --> 37:16.775
...throwing your cat at everybody.
- I'm not throwing my cat at everybody.

37:16.943 --> 37:19.945
I had to hear from Jackie Rudetsky.

37:20.112 --> 37:21.780
<i>Do you know</i>
<i>how embarrassing that is?</i>

37:21.948 --> 37:26.284
Finding out you slept with some
gay dude from Jackie Rudetsky?

37:26.452 --> 37:27.827
Must've been embarrassing.

37:27.995 --> 37:29.746
<i>Why didn't you tell me</i>
<i>you were going?</i>

37:29.914 --> 37:31.915
I would've come with
and held your hair.

37:32.083 --> 37:34.209
Are you really making this
about you right now?

37:34.377 --> 37:37.963
- You're starting to get a reputation.
- You're coming off as a little pious.

37:38.130 --> 37:39.839
You're pissing me off
more than usual.

37:40.007 --> 37:41.967
<i>I think it's a best friend's duty...</i>

37:42.134 --> 37:46.471
...to let her know that everyone, and
I do mean everyone, is calling her...

37:46.639 --> 37:48.223
...a dirty skank.

37:48.766 --> 37:52.143
Well, do you think I'm a dirty skank?

37:52.311 --> 37:55.230
You know, I didn't wanna believe it,
but I guess it's true.

37:55.398 --> 37:58.149
<i>That is your identifier.</i>

37:58.317 --> 38:00.735
And you're a jealous virgin.

38:00.903 --> 38:02.070
So...

38:03.948 --> 38:05.991
<i>People thought I was a dirty skank?</i>

38:06.158 --> 38:09.327
<i>Fine, I'd be the dirtiest skank</i>
<i>they'd ever seen.</i>

38:31.684 --> 38:33.351
Shit.

38:38.190 --> 38:41.443
Is everything all right? It sounds like
you're having sex in here...

38:41.610 --> 38:45.196
...which can't be true, due to the fact
that you have a homosexual boyfriend.

38:45.364 --> 38:47.782
He's not my boyfriend.

38:47.950 --> 38:51.661
Hey, no judgment.
All God's children. It's fine.

38:51.829 --> 38:54.539
I was gay once for a while.

38:54.707 --> 38:57.876
No big deal. We all do it. It's okay.

38:58.044 --> 38:59.961
Dad, can you just
shut the door, please?

39:00.129 --> 39:01.212
You all right, buddy?

39:03.507 --> 39:05.050
Yeah.

39:06.052 --> 39:07.635
Give them hell.

39:52.932 --> 39:54.766
- Hey, Anson.
- Hey.

39:54.934 --> 40:00.438
I just realized the funniest thing.
My name is an anagram for "I love."

40:01.065 --> 40:03.441
What's a...? What's an anagram?

40:03.776 --> 40:04.901
Look it up, big boy.

40:06.112 --> 40:07.445
What's your problem?

40:07.613 --> 40:09.197
You wanna know
what my problem is?

40:09.365 --> 40:13.201
No. That was a rhetorical question.
I don't wanna know anything from you.

40:13.369 --> 40:15.370
We are not friends anymore.

40:15.538 --> 40:17.330
We are officially over.

40:17.498 --> 40:18.957
Oh, rats.

40:19.125 --> 40:23.336
I want my Juicy sweatshirt back. It was
too loose around your chest anyway.

40:23.504 --> 40:25.547
Burn.

40:25.923 --> 40:27.632
- Stop.
- What?

40:47.319 --> 40:48.987
What are you doing?

40:50.156 --> 40:51.781
Nothing.

40:55.453 --> 40:57.954
Don't forget, tomorrow's Earth Day.

40:58.664 --> 41:02.333
Guys, we have a problem:
Olive Penderghast.

41:02.501 --> 41:04.169
- We need to pray for her.
- Amen.

41:04.336 --> 41:06.921
But we also need to
get her the hell out of here.

41:07.089 --> 41:08.131
Amen.

41:08.299 --> 41:10.508
You heard what happened
at Melody Bostic's.

41:10.676 --> 41:13.553
- I was there. I heard the whole thing.
- That's not something...

41:13.721 --> 41:16.681
...you need to advertise, Kurt.
- Sorry. But I was.

41:16.849 --> 41:21.019
I tried to witness to her, but this girl
is defiant to any type of help.

41:21.187 --> 41:23.855
Anybody here think they can
talk to her, get her to see...

41:24.023 --> 41:26.065
...what she's doing is wrong?

41:28.694 --> 41:31.946
- It's okay.
- I'm sorry, you guys. This is so stupid.

41:32.114 --> 41:35.450
No, it's not, Marianne. It's real.

41:35.618 --> 41:36.701
- It's real.
- Yeah, it is.

41:36.869 --> 41:38.745
Jesus tells us to love everyone.

41:38.913 --> 41:43.500
I mean, even the whores and
the homosexuals, but it's just so hard.

41:43.667 --> 41:48.213
It's so hard because they keep
doing it over and over again.

41:49.590 --> 41:50.965
Make me a promise.

41:51.133 --> 41:53.718
Make God a promise,
right here and right now...

41:53.886 --> 41:56.846
...that we will remain
pure and chaste until marriage.

41:57.014 --> 41:58.056
We promise.

41:58.224 --> 42:01.559
Awesome, awesome, awesome.

42:01.727 --> 42:06.105
I love you guys. God loves you guys.
Now, let's change lives today.

42:06.273 --> 42:08.316
- Micah?
- Let's do it.

42:32.883 --> 42:35.051
<i>I didn't know what they</i>
<i>were so upset about.</i>

42:35.219 --> 42:38.096
<i>I put an A on my wardrobe</i>
<i>just like they asked.</i>

42:38.264 --> 42:41.599
<i>Maybe it was because I was wearing</i>
<i>clothes that were two sizes too small.</i>

42:41.767 --> 42:43.101
Hey, Olive!

42:45.312 --> 42:47.981
You left your glass slipper
at the party the other night.

42:48.148 --> 42:51.401
Yeah, and I got pumpkin
all over my dress too.

42:52.403 --> 42:54.779
Nice. Solid joke.

42:54.947 --> 42:57.490
It sucks because we could've
revisited Melody's bedroom.

42:57.658 --> 42:59.742
Oh, my God,
that was Melody Bostic's house.

42:59.910 --> 43:02.620
- Yeah.
- I can't believe you remember that.

43:02.788 --> 43:06.291
Well, yeah, come on. Who doesn't
remember their first almost-kiss?

43:08.961 --> 43:10.420
Hey, Olive.

43:10.588 --> 43:12.297
Evan. Hey, what's rocking?

43:12.464 --> 43:13.965
Can I talk to you for a second?

43:14.133 --> 43:15.842
Yeah, what's up?

43:16.302 --> 43:18.845
Don't get mad, but Brandon told me
what you did for him.

43:19.013 --> 43:22.807
Oh, well, rest assured,
it was equally as thrilling for me.

43:22.975 --> 43:24.767
No, he told me the truth.

43:25.894 --> 43:28.021
I was just hoping
you could do the same for me?

43:28.522 --> 43:29.939
Goodbye, Evan.

43:30.107 --> 43:32.900
Wait, wait. I can pay you.

43:33.068 --> 43:35.862
I am about six seconds away
from slapping you so hard...

43:36.030 --> 43:39.073
...your teeth will bleed.
- Can you do it in front of everyone?

43:40.868 --> 43:43.369
I don't need your permission,
you know.

43:45.623 --> 43:46.831
What?

43:46.999 --> 43:49.626
I mean, at the rate you're going...

43:49.793 --> 43:51.961
...I don't see how people
won't believe it.

43:52.129 --> 43:54.547
- Are you threatening me?
- I'll give you 100 bucks.

43:54.715 --> 43:56.132
You are repugnant.

43:57.009 --> 43:58.384
That's the problem.

44:00.012 --> 44:01.012
Never mind.

44:02.181 --> 44:04.182
I'm sorry I asked.

44:10.981 --> 44:13.066
I knew it wouldn't work.

44:13.609 --> 44:14.942
I'm just a fat piece of shit.

44:16.487 --> 44:18.446
When will high school end already?

44:24.036 --> 44:25.870
Shit.

44:26.038 --> 44:30.500
I want a $100 gift card deposited
into my locker by noon tomorrow.

44:30.668 --> 44:33.878
Preferably to the Gap, but I will
also take Amazon.com or OfficeMax.

44:34.046 --> 44:38.049
Actually, make it OfficeMax.
I have my eye on a label maker.

44:38.217 --> 44:40.843
We did not have sex, okay?

44:41.011 --> 44:44.055
I let you fondle my chest,
and it was a glorious moment for you...

44:44.223 --> 44:47.392
...unmatched by anything
you've experienced, including cake.

44:47.559 --> 44:48.601
Got it?

44:49.311 --> 44:51.729
Wait a minute.
A hundred bucks for second base?

44:51.897 --> 44:54.357
- Yeah.
- Doesn't that seem a little steep?

44:54.525 --> 44:58.236
Can we throw in, like, some
butt action or some pants rubbing?

44:58.404 --> 45:00.988
- What are you, 9?
- Whatever. Are you in?

45:03.033 --> 45:05.201
- Whatever.
- Deal, then.

45:05.994 --> 45:07.495
Thanks, Olive.

45:07.663 --> 45:09.288
You know, the sad thing is, Evan...

45:09.456 --> 45:13.918
...if you'd been a gentleman
and maybe asked me on a date...

45:14.086 --> 45:15.294
...I might've said yes.

45:15.462 --> 45:18.089
Really?
Do you wanna go out with me?

45:18.257 --> 45:19.799
Not now I don't, shit-dick.

45:23.429 --> 45:27.098
<i>It should come as no surprise that the</i>
<i>rumor I was soliciting sex for money...</i>

45:27.266 --> 45:29.517
<i>... spread around the school</i>
<i>faster than...</i>

45:29.685 --> 45:33.354
<i>Well, faster than the first rumor</i>
<i>about me spread.</i>

45:36.400 --> 45:38.234
Guys, come over here.

46:04.970 --> 46:07.138
She'll do stuff for money.
Around the world...

46:07.306 --> 46:10.475
<i>But for people who knew the truth,</i>
<i>I was open for business.</i>

46:10.642 --> 46:15.104
<i>And whether I liked it or not,</i>
<i>I had a lot of customers.</i>

46:16.315 --> 46:18.649
<i>Phil Lord gave me</i>
<i>100 bucks from Best Buy...</i>

46:18.817 --> 46:22.320
<i>... so he could tell people</i>
<i>we hooked up behind the library.</i>

46:22.488 --> 46:25.239
<i>I got $50 from T.J. Maxx</i>
<i>so that Eric Ling could say...</i>

46:25.407 --> 46:28.034
<i>... we got it on during Chemistry.</i>

46:28.368 --> 46:31.954
<i>Ninety dollars from Panda Express</i>
<i>so Ryan Dukes could tell people...</i>

46:32.122 --> 46:35.833
<i>... I showed him mine,</i>
<i>but he did not show me his.</i>

46:36.001 --> 46:38.294
<i>Chris Miller,</i>
<i>big spender that he is...</i>

46:38.462 --> 46:42.006
<i>... gave me $40 worth of movie passes</i>
<i>for my pretend cowbell.</i>

46:42.174 --> 46:44.467
<i>They had an expiration date</i>
<i>and were only good...</i>

46:44.635 --> 46:46.469
<i>... at the stupid foreign movie theater.</i>

46:46.637 --> 46:52.642
Hi. One for
<i>Der Scharlachrote Buchstabe.</i>

46:52.810 --> 46:55.770
<i>But even that is better</i>
<i>than Sanjay Chandrasekhar.</i>

46:55.938 --> 47:00.066
Seriously? A coupon? Twenty percent
off to Bath & Body Works?

47:00.234 --> 47:03.402
Is that how much our imaginary tryst
meant to you?

47:03.779 --> 47:05.363
I fake rocked your world.

47:05.531 --> 47:08.032
- It's all I can afford.
- How's that my problem, amigo?

47:08.200 --> 47:11.202
<i>I knew he wasn't Latino,</i>
<i>but for some reason all these shady...</i>

47:11.370 --> 47:13.663
<i>... backdoor deals</i>
<i>had me talking like Carlito.</i>

47:14.039 --> 47:16.165
- Beat it, ese.
- Okay.

47:16.333 --> 47:18.292
<i>Whatever happened to chivalry?</i>

47:18.460 --> 47:21.379
Does it only exist in '80s movies?

47:21.547 --> 47:25.633
<i>I want John Cusack holding</i>
<i>a boombox outside my window.</i>

47:25.801 --> 47:28.427
<i>I wanna ride off on a lawn mower</i>
<i>with Patrick Dempsey.</i>

47:28.887 --> 47:32.682
I want Jake from Sixteen Candles
<i>waiting outside the church for me.</i>

47:32.850 --> 47:35.601
<i>I want Judd Nelson</i>
<i>thrusting his fist into the air...</i>

47:35.769 --> 47:37.228
<i>... because he knows he got me.</i>

47:37.396 --> 47:40.356
<i>Just once, I want my life</i>
<i>to be like an '80s movie.</i>

47:40.941 --> 47:43.734
<i>Preferably one with a really awesome</i>
<i>musical number...</i>

47:43.902 --> 47:45.945
<i>... for no apparent reason.</i>

47:46.488 --> 47:51.033
But, no. No.
John Hughes did not direct my life.

47:51.201 --> 47:53.995
So instead of all that...

47:54.162 --> 47:57.373
...I get to save 15 cents...

47:57.541 --> 48:00.376
...on a bottle of Juniper Breeze
Antibacterial Gel.

48:00.544 --> 48:04.839
So if you're still with me,
and I'm hoping that most of you are...

48:05.007 --> 48:07.758
...this brings us to part four.

48:09.261 --> 48:12.597
How I, Olive Penderghast,
went from assumed trollop...

48:12.764 --> 48:14.432
...to an actual home-wrecker.

48:16.768 --> 48:20.605
- You wanted to see me?
- I did. Why don't you come in here?

48:28.113 --> 48:29.155
What's going on?

48:29.948 --> 48:32.617
- I'm accessorizing.
- Really?

48:32.784 --> 48:36.329
I think you're taking your reading
assignment a little bit too seriously.

48:36.496 --> 48:39.874
Well, I was really hoping
to get an A. Get it?

48:42.920 --> 48:44.295
I'm hearing some rumors.

48:44.463 --> 48:47.673
Well, those are true. I am considering
becoming an existentialist.

48:47.841 --> 48:50.426
- You know what I'm talking about.
- Jeez.

48:50.594 --> 48:54.889
When did teachers become
privy to idle adolescent gossip?

48:55.057 --> 49:00.895
That would be when everyone
is putting everything up on Facebook.

49:01.063 --> 49:03.481
I don't know what
your generation's fascination is...

49:03.649 --> 49:06.025
...with documenting
your every thought...

49:06.193 --> 49:09.403
...but I can assure you
they're not all diamonds.

49:09.571 --> 49:11.989
"Roman is having an okay day...

49:12.157 --> 49:16.327
...and bought a Coke Zero
at the gas station.

49:16.495 --> 49:17.912
Raise the roof."

49:18.080 --> 49:19.330
Who gives a rat's ass?

49:19.498 --> 49:21.832
He got a Coke Zero again?

49:22.000 --> 49:24.168
That Roman. Incorrigible.

49:24.336 --> 49:28.047
Listen, whatever this little act is about,
I just... I'm curious.

49:28.215 --> 49:31.133
I really think you should consider
giving me extra credit...

49:31.301 --> 49:32.593
...for going the extra mile.

49:32.761 --> 49:35.763
I'm really attempting to understand
this puritanical ostracism...

49:35.931 --> 49:38.975
...Hawthorne wrote about.
- You are one of the few that read it.

49:39.142 --> 49:41.811
If I read one more paper
from one of your classmates...

49:41.979 --> 49:46.607
...who talks about how hot she is in
the bathtub, her fake British accent...

49:46.775 --> 49:50.820
...or, is she still married to
Ashton Kutcher, I'm gonna kill myself.

49:50.988 --> 49:53.656
Why don't people just watch
the original movie like I did?

49:54.241 --> 49:55.658
I know you read the book.

49:56.702 --> 49:57.868
I did.

49:58.036 --> 50:01.455
Listen, I want to apologize for
sending you to the principal's office.

50:01.623 --> 50:04.125
Truthfully, and I'll deny it
if you say anything...

50:04.292 --> 50:07.044
...I wanted to be cheering
with the rest of the students.

50:07.212 --> 50:09.714
I don't know what it is about Nina.

50:10.007 --> 50:11.632
I hate her.

50:11.800 --> 50:12.842
I won't tell.

50:13.010 --> 50:14.427
- I'll deny it if you do.
- Okay.

50:14.594 --> 50:16.721
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

50:16.888 --> 50:18.514
Stay golden.

50:18.682 --> 50:22.226
- Hi, Mrs. Griffith.
- Hi, you. How are you?

50:22.394 --> 50:24.729
A is for "awesome."

50:24.896 --> 50:26.439
Yeah.

50:27.065 --> 50:28.774
I've never seen that girl before.

50:28.942 --> 50:30.818
That does not surprise me.

50:30.986 --> 50:33.904
But I'm the guidance counselor.
I should know all the students.

50:34.072 --> 50:36.574
Especially the ones
who dress like prostitutes.

50:36.742 --> 50:39.452
- It's good to see you.
- Hey. How are you? Good.

50:40.245 --> 50:43.914
No, stop. We're at school.
There are rules.

50:44.082 --> 50:46.417
- Windows.
- Yeah, yeah.

50:46.710 --> 50:48.753
Do me a favor, though.
Just talk to her.

50:48.920 --> 50:50.713
I think she's going through a phase.

50:50.881 --> 50:53.424
That's not the girl
everyone's talking about, is it?

50:53.592 --> 50:54.592
It is.

50:54.760 --> 50:57.386
Oh, okay. Oh, this'll be good.
All right.

50:57.554 --> 51:00.014
That snotty, Jesus-freak
office aide I have...

51:00.182 --> 51:02.141
...has been bitching
about her incessantly.

51:02.309 --> 51:06.604
They're all lies, but she could use
somebody to talk to anyway.

51:06.772 --> 51:09.356
All right. Hey, what are you doing
for dinner tonight?

51:09.524 --> 51:11.067
- You won't be there?
- Sorry.

51:11.234 --> 51:14.278
I have an after-school session.
Kid brought a knife to school.

51:14.446 --> 51:15.738
Well, be careful, all right?

51:15.906 --> 51:18.365
It was a butter knife.
But you know what they say.

51:18.533 --> 51:20.493
You know, it's a gateway knife, so...

51:20.660 --> 51:22.161
- All right, bye.
- Yeah. Bye.

51:22.329 --> 51:25.081
I'm thinking about another gateway.
It's a...

51:27.918 --> 51:28.959
Making spaghetti.

51:29.127 --> 51:31.045
- That's great.
- With meat.

51:31.213 --> 51:32.546
Enjoy eating your meat.

51:32.714 --> 51:35.424
- And balls.
- Enjoy eating your balls.

51:45.310 --> 51:46.685
Sharpening your pencils?

51:48.188 --> 51:49.605
Getting them nice and sharp?

51:50.273 --> 51:54.568
Sharpening them up? Look at you.
Look at you. So sharp.

51:54.736 --> 51:57.029
Sharpening those pencils.
Sharp, sharp, sharp.

51:57.489 --> 52:00.324
- God, that's sharp. L...
- Hey, Olive. You ready to come in?

52:03.328 --> 52:04.370
Good job.

52:04.538 --> 52:07.123
Well, the reason I called you in
was just so we could...

52:07.290 --> 52:10.167
...sort of, you know, just chat
about what's going on.

52:10.335 --> 52:12.962
You know, there is concern
from a few faculty members.

52:13.130 --> 52:14.630
Your husband.

52:14.798 --> 52:17.299
Olive, you're attempting
to make a statement.

52:17.467 --> 52:20.678
I'm just a little confused
as to what exactly that is.

52:21.304 --> 52:22.346
Am I in trouble?

52:22.514 --> 52:24.974
Because, pursuant
to the student code of conduct...

52:25.142 --> 52:27.810
...my hemline has never been
higher than my fingertips.

52:27.978 --> 52:29.311
No, you're not in trouble.

52:29.479 --> 52:31.021
I wanted to make sure you knew...

52:31.189 --> 52:33.566
...if there's something
that you wanna talk about...

52:33.733 --> 52:35.526
...you know, you can trust me.

52:35.694 --> 52:39.655
If I open up to you, do you promise
this stays in confidence?

52:40.699 --> 52:43.075
Yeah. I'm... See?
I'm the guidance counselor.

52:43.243 --> 52:44.618
That's what I do.

52:45.036 --> 52:47.037
I mean, I have a reputation to uphold.

52:47.205 --> 52:48.372
Don't you, though?

52:50.876 --> 52:54.879
All right, listen, don't tell anyone
I'm doing this, please.

52:55.046 --> 52:56.172
Here you go.

52:56.339 --> 52:58.215
- Here you go.
- I really don't need those.

52:58.383 --> 53:01.760
Oh, you really do. Here you go.

53:01.928 --> 53:03.512
Here you go. Okay?

53:03.680 --> 53:07.433
I just don't want this thing you're
going through to define your life.

53:07.601 --> 53:09.310
Olive, do what you gotta do. Okay?

53:09.477 --> 53:13.981
Let your freak flag fly. Just make sure
you have an exit strategy.

53:14.733 --> 53:18.110
Listen, Mrs. Griffith, I really...
I don't need these.

53:18.278 --> 53:20.696
The pill is not 100 percent effective.

53:20.864 --> 53:22.656
Ask some of your friends' parents.

53:23.700 --> 53:25.409
Thank you for coming in.

53:28.747 --> 53:31.999
Can you just send in the next person?
Thank you.

53:35.629 --> 53:37.254
You're up, hoss.

53:37.797 --> 53:40.341
Okay. Go. It's all right.

53:42.594 --> 53:44.887
Everything's gonna be okay.

53:51.353 --> 53:54.897
Don't you think it's a little strange
that your boyfriend is 22 years old...

53:55.065 --> 53:58.192
...and still in high school?
- Not that it's any of your business...

53:58.360 --> 53:59.735
...but he is here by choice.

53:59.903 --> 54:03.864
It's his choice he's a fourth-year senior
that can't pass any test he takes?

54:04.032 --> 54:06.367
His choice. His? His?

54:06.534 --> 54:07.576
Capital H?

54:07.744 --> 54:11.247
If God wanted him to graduate, God
would've given him the right answers.

54:14.626 --> 54:17.169
I'm sorry.
You gotta be shitting me, woman.

54:17.629 --> 54:20.089
Okay. So why was he blubbering
like a baby?

54:21.174 --> 54:24.760
- Is he struggling with his sexuality?
- No, you insensitive rhymes-with-witch.

54:24.928 --> 54:28.055
His parents are
going through a divorce.

54:31.476 --> 54:33.269
Okay.

54:40.068 --> 54:44.822
You know,
sometimes our boyfriend's parents...

54:44.990 --> 54:46.448
...they get divorced, you know?

54:46.616 --> 54:50.577
And it's important to remember
it's not your fault.

54:50.745 --> 54:51.787
So I gotta go.

54:53.164 --> 54:57.710
But they go to our church.
What will people say?

55:02.007 --> 55:06.343
How long do these embraces usually
last? Because I gotta go, but l...

55:06.511 --> 55:09.179
- Are you gonna be okay?
- Yes, I'm gonna be okay.

55:09.347 --> 55:11.056
Mrs. Griffith is amazing...

55:11.224 --> 55:14.977
...and she's gonna help Micah,
and everything's gonna be okay.

55:16.104 --> 55:19.815
See? All right, that's the spirit.
Everything's gonna be okay.

55:19.983 --> 55:21.650
Okay.

55:26.072 --> 55:28.991
Wait. Why are you even
being so nice to me?

55:31.077 --> 55:32.995
I did it.

55:34.039 --> 55:35.122
I got through to you.

55:38.209 --> 55:41.128
I'm so sorry about everything I said.
I am so, so sorry.

55:41.296 --> 55:45.507
I mean, I really want us to be friends.
Can we please be friends?

55:46.343 --> 55:47.468
Absolutely.

55:50.638 --> 55:53.891
<i>And for a day,</i>
<i>we were actually really good friends.</i>

55:54.059 --> 55:56.977
<i>I was kind of starting to think</i>
<i>things were gonna turn around.</i>

55:57.145 --> 55:58.937
Olive!

55:59.105 --> 56:01.523
- Friend.
- Hey, friend.

56:01.691 --> 56:03.400
- I missed you.
- Oh, I missed you more.

56:03.568 --> 56:06.737
<i>She texted me in first period.</i>

56:14.120 --> 56:16.830
<i>By second period,</i>
<i>we apparently had private jokes.</i>

56:16.998 --> 56:19.208
Olive. Olive.

56:22.879 --> 56:25.130
<i>Tragedy struck in Wood Shop.</i>

56:25.298 --> 56:27.424
<i>It wasn't because</i>
<i>someone sawed off a thumb...</i>

56:27.592 --> 56:29.093
<i>... which has happened.</i>

56:29.260 --> 56:32.137
Micah is in the hospital.
He is in so much pain.

56:32.305 --> 56:35.432
The nurse didn't know
what was wrong.

56:36.101 --> 56:38.102
There, there.

56:45.235 --> 56:47.486
It hurts so bad, Mommy.

56:47.654 --> 56:50.239
Well, it's just what I thought.
Chlamydia.

56:50.532 --> 56:51.865
No.

56:52.033 --> 56:55.619
Who have you been screwing?
Tell me.

56:55.787 --> 56:59.790
Tell me now
or I will kill you right here.

57:00.166 --> 57:03.293
Olive. Olive Penderghast!

57:06.589 --> 57:09.216
Olive. Olive Penderghast.

57:09.384 --> 57:11.718
I have to call you back.
Okay. Bye-bye.

57:11.886 --> 57:14.096
Goddamn it.

57:16.433 --> 57:18.559
Chlamydia?!

57:20.812 --> 57:22.771
That bitch!

57:24.983 --> 57:26.567
- Olive?
- Hey.

57:28.653 --> 57:32.448
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Goddamn it.

57:34.534 --> 57:35.659
<i>I panicked.</i>

57:35.827 --> 57:38.745
I said I got it
from Olive Penderghast.

57:38.913 --> 57:42.040
I know, but what was
I supposed to say?

57:42.208 --> 57:44.877
You know, and then my mom
tells Marianne's mom.

57:45.044 --> 57:47.713
I did. I tried to blame it
on their divorce...

57:47.881 --> 57:50.966
...but my mom is not buying it.

57:51.509 --> 57:53.844
That's it. I have to tell them.

57:54.012 --> 57:58.015
No, I do not care that you
gave me chlamydia. I don't!

57:58.224 --> 58:02.728
I love you and I want to be with you,
and nobody can stop us.

58:02.896 --> 58:06.773
<i>Not my mother, not Marianne,</i>
<i>and not even the school board...</i>

58:06.941 --> 58:09.276
...or the president of the Americas!

58:10.195 --> 58:13.864
Oh, God.

58:18.870 --> 58:21.455
What? What do you want?
What do you want?

58:21.623 --> 58:23.207
Just go.

58:26.461 --> 58:28.504
Perfect. Just perfect.

58:29.380 --> 58:32.299
I'm sorry, I just...
I was looking for Marianne.

58:32.467 --> 58:34.426
Did she say anything
about being mad at me?

58:34.594 --> 58:36.386
She just smacked
the bejesus out of me.

58:36.554 --> 58:39.431
No, that's my fault.
I'm so sorry, Olive. I'm sorry.

58:39.599 --> 58:43.477
But I messed up, okay?
I just goddamn shit...

58:43.645 --> 58:48.148
...goddamn messed up
really goddamn shit bad.

58:48.316 --> 58:50.234
Goddamn. Shit, goddamn.

58:50.401 --> 58:54.530
Okay. Don't get me wrong
because I love it...

58:54.697 --> 58:58.408
...but I don't think you're supposed to
use that language in front of a student.

58:58.576 --> 59:01.578
You know what else you're not
supposed to do, is sleep with them.

59:01.746 --> 59:03.997
But that didn't stop me. Goddamn shit.

59:04.749 --> 59:07.501
Wait. You... Oh, my God.

59:07.669 --> 59:11.088
But I'm not... I'm not judging
you or anything, but, oh, my God.

59:11.256 --> 59:15.175
L... Wait, what does that
have to do with me?

59:15.343 --> 59:17.427
You should know
that my marriage is not great.

59:17.595 --> 59:19.263
We haven't slept together
in months.

59:19.430 --> 59:20.472
In months, all right?

59:20.640 --> 59:24.685
Finally, this great-looking guy comes
in and he's nice to me, you know?

59:24.852 --> 59:26.061
And he's not a minor.

59:26.229 --> 59:30.440
This is legal. It's legal
because he's been here forever, okay?

59:30.608 --> 59:33.402
He's not the sharpest
Christian in the Bible, all right?

59:33.570 --> 59:36.780
And then he finds out
that he has chlamydia.

59:36.948 --> 59:39.908
And so then he's telling
everybody that it was you.

59:40.076 --> 59:41.785
He didn't want me
to lose my job...

59:41.953 --> 59:45.372
...and he doesn't wanna get in trouble
either, so he said it's you.

59:45.540 --> 59:46.748
I'm sorry.

59:47.959 --> 59:50.919
But I'Il... I'm gonna fix it, Olive.
Okay? I'll tell everyone.

59:51.087 --> 59:55.966
I'm gonna tell everyone that it's me.
Okay? I'll just... I'll lose my job.

59:56.467 --> 59:59.803
And, you know, whatever else I lose,
and then that's okay.

01:00:03.474 --> 01:00:06.560
<i>Maybe it was becoming a habit</i>
<i>of mine to help the downtrodden...</i>

01:00:06.728 --> 01:00:08.687
<i>... or maybe I just couldn't stand</i>
<i>to see...</i>

01:00:08.855 --> 01:00:10.772
<i>... my favorite teacher's</i>
<i>marriage crumble.</i>

01:00:10.940 --> 01:00:13.150
<i>Either way, I decided to help.</i>

01:00:13.651 --> 01:00:15.819
I could have chlamydia.

01:00:17.363 --> 01:00:21.450
I mean, I could have easily given it
to Micah.

01:00:21.618 --> 01:00:23.493
I mean, who knows?

01:00:23.661 --> 01:00:26.580
Women oftentimes
don't show symptoms.

01:00:26.748 --> 01:00:29.082
And the whole world knows
I've been whoring around.

01:00:29.250 --> 01:00:30.792
No, you haven't. No, you haven't.

01:00:30.960 --> 01:00:36.298
Because a real whore can't admit it
to herself, much less others. Trust me.

01:00:39.260 --> 01:00:40.594
Call Micah.

01:00:40.762 --> 01:00:44.139
Tell him he is an ass and
he owes me so big for this, but also...

01:00:44.307 --> 01:00:47.142
...tell him I confessed
to giving him chlamydia.

01:00:54.692 --> 01:00:57.194
Getting a lot of hugs today.

01:00:57.820 --> 01:01:00.322
- You're going to hell, Olive!
- Get out of here!

01:01:02.909 --> 01:01:05.202
<i>I guess I shouldn't be too shocked</i>
<i>these people...</i>

01:01:05.370 --> 01:01:07.120
<i>... wanted my diseased ass</i>
<i>out of there.</i>

01:01:07.288 --> 01:01:08.330
Save yourself, Olive.

01:01:08.498 --> 01:01:11.333
<i>The funny thing is, the whole time</i>
<i>this all was going down...</i>

01:01:11.501 --> 01:01:14.544
<i>... I couldn't help but think</i>
<i>I could've come up with better signs.</i>

01:01:14.712 --> 01:01:16.546
<i>Although you gotta love</i>
<i>the Quiznos guy.</i>

01:01:16.714 --> 01:01:19.883
<i>That's the one thing</i>
<i>that trumps religion: Capitalism.</i>

01:01:20.051 --> 01:01:21.468
Why are you doing this?

01:01:21.636 --> 01:01:23.762
I'm trying to make this school
a better place.

01:01:23.930 --> 01:01:26.223
Start a petition to get rid
of the lead paint.

01:01:26.391 --> 01:01:27.724
New Honey Chicken at Quiznos.

01:01:27.892 --> 01:01:30.143
- Not now, Quiznos.
- You're a slut.

01:01:30.311 --> 01:01:31.478
You're going down, Olive.

01:01:31.646 --> 01:01:34.981
If this is because I'm more popular
than you, then I think what you're...

01:01:35.149 --> 01:01:37.651
Let's not mistake popularity
for infamy.

01:01:37.819 --> 01:01:40.696
- You don't wanna burn, do you?
- I'll be praying for you.

01:01:45.743 --> 01:01:47.452
Sorry.

01:01:48.079 --> 01:01:51.581
- You okay?
- Yeah. I'm awesome. I'm awesome.

01:01:51.749 --> 01:01:53.250
Screw all these people, Olive.

01:01:53.418 --> 01:01:55.585
Haven't you heard?

01:01:55.753 --> 01:01:57.921
I already did.

01:01:58.089 --> 01:02:01.091
- You're going to hell, Olive!
- What you're doing is wrong.

01:02:01.426 --> 01:02:03.427
You're going to hell!

01:02:08.266 --> 01:02:10.434
<i>So they got Rhiannon.</i>

01:02:10.601 --> 01:02:13.854
<i>Never underestimate the power</i>
<i>of extremists like Marianne.</i>

01:02:14.021 --> 01:02:17.774
<i>They sense any weakness,</i>
<i>they pounce like jungle cats.</i>

01:02:17.942 --> 01:02:20.694
<i>And the whack pack</i>
<i>just gets bigger and bigger.</i>

01:02:20.862 --> 01:02:22.946
<i>But at least they have a pack.</i>

01:02:23.114 --> 01:02:26.992
<i>I was used to being by myself,</i>
<i>but I had never felt more alone.</i>

01:02:27.160 --> 01:02:30.620
<i>I thought I should look into what they</i>
<i>were running around thumping about.</i>

01:02:30.788 --> 01:02:33.081
- Do you have a religion section?
- It's over there.

01:02:33.249 --> 01:02:35.250
- Can I help you with something?
- The Bible.

01:02:35.418 --> 01:02:38.378
That's in bestsellers,
right next to Twilight.

01:02:40.131 --> 01:02:42.340
<i>I didn't have time</i>
<i>to read the whole thing...</i>

01:02:42.508 --> 01:02:44.050
<i>... because it's, like, 600 pages.</i>

01:02:44.218 --> 01:02:45.719
<i>Single-spaced.</i>

01:02:45.887 --> 01:02:48.472
<i>And as every war</i>
<i>that's ever been fought can tell you...</i>

01:02:48.639 --> 01:02:50.640
<i>... there are many ways</i>
<i>you can interpret it.</i>

01:02:50.808 --> 01:02:53.769
<i>Except the Civil War.</i>
<i>That was pure racism.</i>

01:02:53.936 --> 01:02:55.270
<i>So I went to find an expert.</i>

01:02:55.813 --> 01:02:59.816
<i>But really, I just kind of</i>
<i>wanted someone to talk to.</i>

01:03:01.152 --> 01:03:04.821
Forgive me, Father,
for I have sinned.

01:03:05.323 --> 01:03:07.240
I think that's how you
start these things.

01:03:07.408 --> 01:03:09.659
I'm just going off
what I've seen in movies.

01:03:09.827 --> 01:03:11.870
Where do I even start?

01:03:13.080 --> 01:03:16.291
I've been pretending to be...

01:03:16.459 --> 01:03:18.335
What is the Catholic way
of phrasing this?

01:03:18.503 --> 01:03:20.337
A harlot?

01:03:21.506 --> 01:03:25.175
A harlot. It's not that
I've actually been doing...

01:03:25.343 --> 01:03:29.012
...the things that people have
been saying I've been doing...

01:03:29.180 --> 01:03:31.306
...but then again,
I'm not denying them either.

01:03:31.474 --> 01:03:34.893
So I was just wondering,
is that wrong?

01:03:35.520 --> 01:03:40.023
It's just that a lot of people
have been asking me to do things...

01:03:40.191 --> 01:03:46.363
...and I thought it was okay
because it wasn't real, you know?

01:03:48.115 --> 01:03:50.283
It was make-believe.

01:03:50.451 --> 01:03:52.869
And no one was getting hurt...

01:03:56.666 --> 01:03:59.751
...but a lot of people hate me now.

01:04:03.297 --> 01:04:05.757
I kind of hate me too.

01:04:11.722 --> 01:04:13.932
I might be wrong...

01:04:14.725 --> 01:04:16.726
...but aren't you
supposed to say something?

01:04:16.894 --> 01:04:18.937
Tell me to say 10 Hail Marys,
pay a fine...

01:04:19.105 --> 01:04:21.606
...advance token to nearest railroad?
Hello?

01:04:23.901 --> 01:04:25.402
<i>Should've seen that one coming.</i>

01:04:32.326 --> 01:04:35.704
<i>Luckily, I live in a town</i>
<i>with many different places of worship.</i>

01:04:35.872 --> 01:04:38.415
<i>So I went to find one</i>
<i>with a real live human being.</i>

01:04:38.833 --> 01:04:39.875
Can I help you?

01:04:40.042 --> 01:04:42.669
Yeah, I was just wondering
if there's a minister around.

01:04:43.337 --> 01:04:45.297
Is it not a minister?

01:04:45.464 --> 01:04:47.507
A Reverend? A wizard?

01:04:47.675 --> 01:04:49.551
It's a pastor, and he's here.

01:04:51.178 --> 01:04:52.596
How can I help you today?

01:04:52.763 --> 01:04:56.099
I was wondering what your church's
stance on lying and adultery was.

01:04:56.267 --> 01:04:57.267
It's not a good thing.

01:04:57.435 --> 01:05:01.771
Oh, I agree, wholeheartedly.
But, then... Now, tell me this.

01:05:01.939 --> 01:05:03.356
Assuming there is a hell...

01:05:03.524 --> 01:05:06.651
Oh, the Christian Church recognizes
the existence of hell.

01:05:06.819 --> 01:05:09.112
Okay, so we'II just say
there's a "hell."

01:05:09.280 --> 01:05:11.406
There is. Just so we're clear.

01:05:11.574 --> 01:05:15.076
- Okay. So for argument's sake...
- No, there's no argument. It's there.

01:05:15.244 --> 01:05:18.830
Right below our feet,
right above the Orient. It's there.

01:05:21.083 --> 01:05:24.753
Then what would be worse,
lying or adultery?

01:05:24.921 --> 01:05:27.631
Or is lying about adultery
just like double whammy? Sorry.

01:05:27.798 --> 01:05:29.299
Come on.

01:05:32.219 --> 01:05:34.137
I'm sorry,
what did you say your name was?

01:05:34.847 --> 01:05:38.308
I didn't. L... You know what?
I'm just gonna...

01:05:38.476 --> 01:05:40.810
I'm just gonna go check out
Judaism because...

01:05:40.978 --> 01:05:42.979
- God. Two frames, really?
- Sorry.

01:05:43.147 --> 01:05:45.273
The Jews and I have a lot in common.

01:05:45.441 --> 01:05:48.193
- Just fashion-wise and stuff.
- Off you go.

01:05:48.361 --> 01:05:51.404
<i>Yes, I had unwittingly sought advice</i>
<i>from the father...</i>

01:05:51.572 --> 01:05:53.657
<i>... of the leader of my lynch mob.</i>

01:05:53.824 --> 01:05:58.954
<i>What other complete and total idiot</i>
<i>can say that's happened to them?</i>

01:06:01.791 --> 01:06:05.251
Okay, I've narrowed it down
<i>to The Other Boleyn Girl...</i>

01:06:05.419 --> 01:06:08.088
...or The Bucket List. Huge hit.

01:06:08.255 --> 01:06:11.174
Why can't we watch a movie for kids?
You always get to pick.

01:06:11.342 --> 01:06:15.011
Because the Family Member
of the Week gets to pick the movie.

01:06:15.179 --> 01:06:17.764
Yeah, but you get Family Member
of the Week every week.

01:06:17.932 --> 01:06:19.432
And there's a reason for that.

01:06:19.600 --> 01:06:22.268
Yeah. You pick
Family Member of the Week.

01:06:22.436 --> 01:06:23.937
Are you accusing me of nepotism?

01:06:24.105 --> 01:06:27.649
Okay, it's The Bucket List.
This is it. This is the greatest decision.

01:06:27.817 --> 01:06:30.944
I'm so happy with this decision.
That's what it's going to be.

01:06:31.112 --> 01:06:34.072
All right, now, honey, after we watch
<i>The Bucket List...</i>

01:06:34.240 --> 01:06:38.785
...remember to cross "Watch
The Bucket List" off our bucket list.

01:06:38.953 --> 01:06:39.995
Guys.

01:06:40.162 --> 01:06:45.291
I want you to know that if you hear
I have chlamydia, that is totally false.

01:06:45.459 --> 01:06:47.961
Olive, do we need
to have the talk again?

01:06:48.129 --> 01:06:50.505
No. It's just a thing
that's going around.

01:06:50.673 --> 01:06:53.550
You know, nothing you're saying
is making me feel any better.

01:06:53.718 --> 01:06:56.386
Not to mention how you've been
dressing the last few days.

01:06:56.554 --> 01:06:58.430
No judgment,
but you look like a stripper.

01:06:58.597 --> 01:07:01.057
- Mom.
- A high-end stripper.

01:07:01.225 --> 01:07:02.851
For governors or athletes.

01:07:03.019 --> 01:07:04.352
But stripper, nonetheless.

01:07:04.520 --> 01:07:07.188
Oh, my God.
I'm just trying to mix it up a little.

01:07:07.356 --> 01:07:09.149
And I have no STDs, I promise you.

01:07:09.316 --> 01:07:11.776
Oh, that's great.
Daughter of the Year.

01:07:11.944 --> 01:07:13.737
If you hear anything
to the contrary...

01:07:13.904 --> 01:07:16.114
...come up with some funny retort
and walk away.

01:07:16.282 --> 01:07:19.075
Honey, you're kind of
starting to worry us a little.

01:07:19.243 --> 01:07:21.244
Should we be kind of
worried a little?

01:07:21.412 --> 01:07:23.246
I don't think so.

01:07:23.414 --> 01:07:26.374
- You sure?
- Yeah.

01:07:26.625 --> 01:07:29.419
Yeah. I got it all under control.

01:07:30.629 --> 01:07:31.671
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:07:31.839 --> 01:07:34.007
Then let's Bucket List this bitch.

01:07:34.175 --> 01:07:36.009
<i>The Bucket List, The Bucket List.</i>

01:07:36.177 --> 01:07:38.553
To say this whole thing
had taken over my life...

01:07:38.721 --> 01:07:41.181
...would be
a colossal understatement.

01:07:41.390 --> 01:07:44.601
I actually reread The Scarlet Letter
<i>to see how Hester dealt with it.</i>

01:07:44.769 --> 01:07:49.606
<i>And it turns out she bore</i>
<i>her punishment in humble silence...</i>

01:07:49.774 --> 01:07:52.942
...which are two concepts
I am not comfortable with.

01:07:53.110 --> 01:07:55.320
<i>With all the mythical play</i>
<i>I was getting...</i>

01:07:55.488 --> 01:07:58.490
<i>... I still actually hadn't been</i>
<i>asked out on a real date.</i>

01:07:58.657 --> 01:08:01.743
<i>People were jumping up and down</i>
<i>to say they'd slept with me...</i>

01:08:01.911 --> 01:08:04.370
<i>... but no one bothered</i>
<i>really trying to sleep with me.</i>

01:08:04.538 --> 01:08:07.457
<i>I was starting to think I actually did</i>
<i>have a gnome down there.</i>

01:08:07.625 --> 01:08:10.001
<i>- Until finally...</i>
- Hey, Olive.

01:08:10.628 --> 01:08:12.378
Hey, Anson. What's up?

01:08:12.546 --> 01:08:14.672
I was wondering
if you were busy tonight.

01:08:14.840 --> 01:08:17.759
Maybe wanna go out or something?

01:08:18.928 --> 01:08:20.386
What did you have in mind?

01:08:20.554 --> 01:08:23.264
I was thinking about getting
a hot-air balloon, you know...

01:08:23.432 --> 01:08:25.140
...bringing along some champagne...

01:08:25.309 --> 01:08:28.645
...and then possibly reading
some Sylvia Plath.

01:08:28.813 --> 01:08:32.189
Or we could just go
to The Lobster Shack...

01:08:32.358 --> 01:08:34.399
...because it's, you know,
a little easier.

01:08:34.568 --> 01:08:37.694
- I love The Lobster Shack.
- Good.

01:08:37.863 --> 01:08:39.322
Okay. It's a date, then.

01:08:40.491 --> 01:08:43.076
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:08:44.787 --> 01:08:47.538
So should I still bring
the Sylvia Plath or?

01:08:47.706 --> 01:08:49.666
No, we could stick our heads
in the oven...

01:08:49.834 --> 01:08:51.917
...if we run out of things
to talk about.

01:08:52.670 --> 01:08:53.670
That was...

01:08:53.837 --> 01:08:55.796
- Cool. All right. Well...
- Cool.

01:09:04.682 --> 01:09:05.974
You look really beautiful.

01:09:06.142 --> 01:09:07.850
Thank you.

01:09:10.020 --> 01:09:11.729
- You're a real gentleman.
- No.

01:09:11.897 --> 01:09:16.401
Just a guy having dinner with a girl.

01:09:27.662 --> 01:09:31.207
Do you believe this whole thing
about lobster being an aphrodisiac?

01:09:31.375 --> 01:09:33.877
I did not know it was.

01:09:34.044 --> 01:09:36.504
Medical science really
has not substantiated claims...

01:09:36.671 --> 01:09:39.883
...that any particular food increases
sexual desire or performance...

01:09:40.050 --> 01:09:42.886
...but guys just spend and spend
to ply women with food...

01:09:43.053 --> 01:09:46.555
...they think is gonna get them lucky.
Which is funny, because, it's like...

01:09:46.724 --> 01:09:49.809
...what is sexy about
slurping back oysters? Nothing.

01:09:49.977 --> 01:09:53.563
Did you know some people actually
eat ground-up rhinoceros horn...

01:09:53.731 --> 01:09:56.774
...because it's thought to increase
the size of the male sex organ?

01:09:56.942 --> 01:09:58.902
That's not true at all.

01:09:59.069 --> 01:10:01.696
Spanish fly. Spanish fly.
You've heard of this? Yes?

01:10:01.864 --> 01:10:03.406
- Yes.
- Okay. That thing?

01:10:03.574 --> 01:10:05.700
Pulverized blister beetle. What?

01:10:05.868 --> 01:10:09.412
And it's illegal in the U.S. Because
if you eat just a little bit too much...

01:10:09.580 --> 01:10:12.749
...it causes painful urination,
fever and bloody discharge.

01:10:12.917 --> 01:10:14.292
- Am I talking too much?
- No.

01:10:14.460 --> 01:10:17.170
You're just burning through
a lot of topics really fast.

01:10:17.338 --> 01:10:20.173
Shouldn't have had coffee
three weeks ago.

01:10:20.341 --> 01:10:21.382
I'm just kidding.

01:10:21.550 --> 01:10:25.386
Your Maine lobster
with crab and seafood stuffing.

01:10:26.764 --> 01:10:28.681
- I'm jealous.
- Thank you.

01:10:29.475 --> 01:10:31.726
Let's dig in. Right?

01:10:35.856 --> 01:10:38.316
I didn't know Woodchuck Todd
worked here.

01:10:45.866 --> 01:10:47.158
He's dressed like a lobster.

01:10:47.326 --> 01:10:50.245
I should start calling him
Lobster Todd.

01:10:55.918 --> 01:10:57.126
Shit.

01:10:57.294 --> 01:10:59.087
- Shit, shit, shit.
- What? What's wrong?

01:10:59.255 --> 01:11:00.755
- Rhiannon's over there.
- So?

01:11:00.923 --> 01:11:03.174
She's been in love with you
since 1 st grade.

01:11:03.342 --> 01:11:05.885
- She's my best friend.
- I thought you weren't speaking.

01:11:06.053 --> 01:11:08.388
But that doesn't mean
she's not my best friend.

01:11:08.555 --> 01:11:10.098
Or that I should be out with you.

01:11:10.266 --> 01:11:12.642
Rhi and I don't have
anything in common.

01:11:12.810 --> 01:11:14.560
- And you and I do?
- Yeah.

01:11:14.728 --> 01:11:17.814
- Like what?
- Like I hate Marianne Bryant too.

01:11:17.982 --> 01:11:20.817
If that's our connection,
I should date the entire school.

01:11:20.985 --> 01:11:22.735
Haven't you?

01:11:23.946 --> 01:11:26.489
No. No, I haven't.

01:11:29.868 --> 01:11:31.577
Okay, she can't see us.
Check. Check.

01:11:31.745 --> 01:11:34.038
Can you just...? Excuse me? Hi.

01:11:34.665 --> 01:11:38.543
I just remembered
I am so allergic to shellfish.

01:11:38.711 --> 01:11:41.004
I forget that my respiratory system
will collapse.

01:11:41.171 --> 01:11:43.423
- I have a gift certificate. Keep the tip.
- Thanks.

01:11:43.590 --> 01:11:45.133
I'm sorry, but we have to go.

01:11:45.301 --> 01:11:48.052
- Go. Go. Come on. Come on.
- Okay.

01:11:48.220 --> 01:11:49.804
Go, go, go.

01:11:57.813 --> 01:11:59.856
I'm sorry about that.

01:12:02.151 --> 01:12:04.569
I've got something for you.

01:12:05.946 --> 01:12:08.197
Two hundred dollars
to The Home Depot.

01:12:14.788 --> 01:12:16.122
I didn't realize this was a...

01:12:16.290 --> 01:12:20.043
I know it sounds kind of lame, but they
really do have some awesome stuff.

01:12:20.210 --> 01:12:22.712
I bought my air compressor there.

01:12:24.214 --> 01:12:26.883
So, what did we do on this date?

01:12:27.051 --> 01:12:28.634
Whatever 200 bucks gets me.

01:12:31.055 --> 01:12:34.098
- That's not really how it works.
- It's okay.

01:12:34.892 --> 01:12:36.392
Stop.

01:12:36.560 --> 01:12:39.228
I'm not really having sex with people
for money.

01:12:39.396 --> 01:12:43.358
I'm saying I'm having sex for money,
but I'm not having sex for money.

01:12:43.525 --> 01:12:45.193
It's okay. It's all right. Come on.

01:12:45.361 --> 01:12:47.028
- Stop. No, no.
- What?

01:12:47.196 --> 01:12:48.446
Stop!

01:12:48.614 --> 01:12:51.199
Come on, just relax. Come on, babe.
It's all right.

01:12:51.367 --> 01:12:54.452
God. Asshole.

01:12:58.624 --> 01:13:01.876
What are you doing? I paid you.

01:13:02.795 --> 01:13:04.754
Now you didn't.

01:13:06.757 --> 01:13:09.759
Come on, this is bullshit.

01:13:14.098 --> 01:13:15.973
Goddamn it.

01:13:17.184 --> 01:13:18.935
Hey, Olive.

01:13:20.354 --> 01:13:22.230
Todd, hi.

01:13:27.611 --> 01:13:30.988
- Hey, you all right?
- I just have something in my eye.

01:13:31.156 --> 01:13:34.534
Like a twig, you know, or a branch,
or a contact, or something.

01:13:34.701 --> 01:13:38.955
- I didn't know you wore contacts.
- I don't, which is why I was tearing up.

01:13:39.706 --> 01:13:43.835
Olive, hey. Let me drive you home.

01:13:51.885 --> 01:13:54.637
Do you wanna talk about it?

01:13:58.142 --> 01:14:02.395
What's to say?
Everybody thinks I'm a whore...

01:14:03.188 --> 01:14:05.773
...and for the first time,
I'm starting to believe it.

01:14:05.941 --> 01:14:06.983
What?

01:14:07.151 --> 01:14:09.986
Don't act like you don't know
what people are saying about me.

01:14:10.154 --> 01:14:12.989
I know what people are saying.
Doesn't mean I believe them.

01:14:13.157 --> 01:14:14.991
- Who told you?
- No one.

01:14:15.159 --> 01:14:18.411
No one had to tell me that once upon
a time, there was a scared kid...

01:14:18.579 --> 01:14:22.415
...at a party in a dark room
who was not ready for his first kiss.

01:14:22.583 --> 01:14:27.044
And, you know, there was
this amazing girl who lied for him.

01:14:27.212 --> 01:14:30.131
I still can't believe
you remember that.

01:14:33.385 --> 01:14:36.429
You know, sometimes I pretend
you were my first real kiss.

01:14:37.848 --> 01:14:39.515
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:14:41.310 --> 01:14:43.352
- Who was?
- It was Rhiannon.

01:14:43.520 --> 01:14:45.229
- What?
- She must have told you.

01:14:45.397 --> 01:14:49.609
Yeah, it was... I think it was, like,
a year after that or something.

01:14:49.776 --> 01:14:52.612
It sucked, by the way.
She was, like:

01:14:52.779 --> 01:14:55.031
That bitch.

01:14:55.199 --> 01:14:57.909
Oh, my God,
she knew how I felt about you.

01:14:58.076 --> 01:15:00.953
- How do you feel about me?
- And here I am feeling so bad.

01:15:01.121 --> 01:15:02.330
That's just perfect.

01:15:02.498 --> 01:15:04.874
Wait, hold on a second.
How do you feel about me?

01:15:05.083 --> 01:15:06.792
"Felt."

01:15:07.169 --> 01:15:08.544
I said "felt."

01:15:10.339 --> 01:15:13.633
Because I thought l...
I thought I heard "feel."

01:15:13.800 --> 01:15:15.426
- No, it was "felt."
- All right.

01:15:15.594 --> 01:15:17.637
How do you know where I live?

01:15:17.804 --> 01:15:19.138
We used to carpool.

01:15:19.640 --> 01:15:22.975
Yeah, in 2nd grade. What, are you
like a savant for people's addresses?

01:15:23.143 --> 01:15:25.228
Just for people who I think are cool.

01:15:25.896 --> 01:15:28.064
- You think I'm cool?
- I do.

01:15:28.232 --> 01:15:31.526
And I think you're pretty and smart.

01:15:31.818 --> 01:15:34.612
Did you form this opinion
prior to my little transformation?

01:15:34.780 --> 01:15:36.447
Way prior.

01:15:37.824 --> 01:15:39.659
Why didn't that rumor spread?

01:15:40.118 --> 01:15:41.869
I like to keep my business to myself.

01:15:42.037 --> 01:15:44.038
Notoriety, for whatever reason...

01:15:44.206 --> 01:15:47.083
...never seems to benefit the noted,
it's only the "notees."

01:15:48.835 --> 01:15:50.419
Where were you two weeks ago?

01:15:55.342 --> 01:15:56.509
Olive.

01:15:57.719 --> 01:16:02.557
If I promise not to tell anyone,
could I kiss you right now?

01:16:06.270 --> 01:16:08.020
No.

01:16:10.065 --> 01:16:12.275
- Okay. Okay. I'm sorry. I'm very sorry.
- Oh, no.

01:16:12.442 --> 01:16:14.569
I just mean, not like this.

01:16:14.736 --> 01:16:17.613
I don't wanna kiss you with mascara
running down my face...

01:16:17.781 --> 01:16:20.283
...and some horndog guy
just having tried...

01:16:20.450 --> 01:16:23.494
...to stick his tongue
down my throat.

01:16:24.621 --> 01:16:27.081
I've wanted to kiss you
since 8th grade...

01:16:28.083 --> 01:16:30.418
...but I want it to be perfect.

01:16:31.420 --> 01:16:34.088
And right now, my life is a mess.

01:16:34.506 --> 01:16:37.842
I need to get my business in order
before I drag you into it.

01:16:38.010 --> 01:16:40.303
What if I told you
I wanna be dragged into it?

01:16:41.263 --> 01:16:42.847
I could help, maybe.

01:17:11.627 --> 01:17:12.793
Why now?

01:17:13.962 --> 01:17:15.963
Why are you all of a sudden
into me now?

01:17:16.131 --> 01:17:17.256
I don't know.

01:17:17.716 --> 01:17:21.135
I haven't overanalyzed it,
like you're about to.

01:17:25.641 --> 01:17:29.226
- Good night, Olive.
- Good night, Lobster Todd.

01:17:31.188 --> 01:17:34.607
<i>Now that I knew there were decent</i>
<i>and goodhearted people out there...</i>

01:17:34.775 --> 01:17:36.359
<i>... the lies had to stop.</i>

01:17:36.526 --> 01:17:40.029
<i>I knew there was only one person I
<i>could count on to set the story straight:</i></i>

01:17:40.197 --> 01:17:41.197
<i>Brandon.</i>

01:17:41.365 --> 01:17:44.617
<i>I'd helped him, and even though</i>
<i>it would destroy his new reputation...</i>

01:17:44.785 --> 01:17:47.328
<i>... as a straight stud,</i>
<i>I knew he'd help me.</i>

01:17:47.496 --> 01:17:50.122
Oh, my God. Did you hear that
Brandon ran away from home?

01:17:50.290 --> 01:17:53.709
Yeah, totally. He left his parents
a note that said, "I'm gay, bitches"...

01:17:53.877 --> 01:17:57.046
...and then he skipped town
with some big, hulking black guy.

01:17:58.340 --> 01:17:59.840
My apologies to Mark Twain.

01:18:00.008 --> 01:18:01.092
- Wait, huh?
- What?

01:18:01.259 --> 01:18:03.219
- You said something.
- You said something.

01:18:03.387 --> 01:18:05.262
You said something,
so I came back.

01:18:05.430 --> 01:18:06.889
- You're funny. Okay.
- Call me.

01:18:07.057 --> 01:18:10.226
<i>I went to everyone I'd helped</i>
<i>and begged them to say it wasn't true.</i>

01:18:10.394 --> 01:18:12.561
No way. I gave you money.

01:18:12.729 --> 01:18:16.357
You gave me a gift card to AutoZone.
I don't even have a car.

01:18:16.525 --> 01:18:18.317
I thought it'd be aspirational.

01:18:18.485 --> 01:18:22.697
Evan, please do this for me, all right?
I did that for you. Do this for me.

01:18:22.864 --> 01:18:25.783
I don't want people to know
I didn't go to second base with you.

01:18:25.951 --> 01:18:28.953
Do you know how many girls
I've hooked up with because of that?

01:18:29.121 --> 01:18:30.663
Girls are almost as dumb as boys.

01:18:30.831 --> 01:18:33.541
Oh, yes, they are.

01:18:37.045 --> 01:18:38.421
<i>It gets worse.</i>

01:18:38.588 --> 01:18:40.214
"Honor your father
and your mother."

01:18:40.382 --> 01:18:43.801
<i>Due to his condition, Micah was sent</i>
<i>on a visit to his grandparents...</i>

01:18:43.969 --> 01:18:45.428
<i>... in Palatka, Florida.</i>

01:18:45.595 --> 01:18:48.764
<i>And if there's one thing worse</i>
<i>than chlamydia, it's Florida.</i>

01:18:48.932 --> 01:18:50.725
"...be guilty of adultery."

01:18:50.892 --> 01:18:52.935
Get your hands
out of your berries, boy.

01:18:53.103 --> 01:18:55.104
<i>Olive, life is full of choices.</i>

01:18:55.272 --> 01:18:58.524
I made a bad one.
But then, so did you.

01:18:58.692 --> 01:19:02.027
But I see no other alternative
than to just live with the guilt.

01:19:02.195 --> 01:19:05.531
My guilt stems from my indiscretion
and yours for lying.

01:19:06.116 --> 01:19:09.827
We made our choices.
Now, we just have to let it ride.

01:19:09.995 --> 01:19:14.290
Or I could just tell everyone the truth
and get you fired and put in jail.

01:19:14.458 --> 01:19:17.084
Okay, first of all, he is of age, okay?

01:19:17.252 --> 01:19:19.462
It's perfectly legal
in the state of California.

01:19:19.629 --> 01:19:22.214
I checked. He is 21 in eight months.

01:19:22.382 --> 01:19:25.301
And secondly, let's play the Who
Would You Believe game, okay?

01:19:25.469 --> 01:19:28.846
Why don't you ask yourself, if you
were an adult, who would you believe?

01:19:29.014 --> 01:19:31.098
Who would you believe?
Who would you believe?

01:19:31.266 --> 01:19:33.434
Who would you believe? Who?

01:19:38.148 --> 01:19:40.357
Thank you for coming in.

01:19:43.695 --> 01:19:48.073
<i>Yeah, Mrs. Griffith was pure evil, but</i>
<i>I still shouldn't have done what I did.</i>

01:19:48.241 --> 01:19:51.035
Your wife has chlamydia,
and she's sleeping with a student...

01:19:51.203 --> 01:19:53.829
...and she gave it to him,
and she's trying to blame me.

01:19:55.165 --> 01:19:56.707
What?

01:20:00.170 --> 01:20:06.509
I'm sorry.

01:20:07.302 --> 01:20:09.762
Mr. Griffith, if you ever see this...

01:20:09.930 --> 01:20:15.851
...just know that I was wrong
to tell you that in that way. At all.

01:20:16.186 --> 01:20:18.062
I shouldn't have done it.

01:20:18.522 --> 01:20:21.190
<i>And I don't even feel bad</i>
<i>for lying for your wife.</i>

01:20:21.358 --> 01:20:26.862
<i>But I hate myself for telling you</i>
<i>the truth. I am so sorry.</i>

01:20:27.030 --> 01:20:31.158
<i>With my words, even though</i>
<i>they were true, I ended a marriage.</i>

01:20:31.368 --> 01:20:35.788
<i>Looking back, that's the thing</i>
<i>I regret the most.</i>

01:20:42.254 --> 01:20:47.633
So now everyone that knows the truth
is either gone or they won't fess up.

01:20:47.801 --> 01:20:52.805
And Marianne Bryant and her
disciples are demanding my head.

01:20:52.973 --> 01:20:56.559
The messed-up thing is I would not put
it past Principal Gibbons to expel me.

01:20:56.726 --> 01:20:58.894
I had a similar situation
when I was your age.

01:20:59.062 --> 01:21:00.729
What? Everyone called you a slut?

01:21:00.897 --> 01:21:03.983
I had a horrible reputation and
people said awful things about me.

01:21:04.484 --> 01:21:06.402
- Why?
- Because I was a slut.

01:21:06.570 --> 01:21:10.990
I slept with a whole bunch of people.
A slew, a heap, a peck. Mostly guys.

01:21:11.157 --> 01:21:13.450
- Mom.
- Sorry, I got around.

01:21:13.618 --> 01:21:16.620
Before I met Dad,
I had incredibly low self-worth.

01:21:16.788 --> 01:21:20.374
Do me a favor and just stuff this down
my throat until I asphyxiate to death.

01:21:20.542 --> 01:21:23.043
- It's true. It is.
- I want to die.

01:21:23.211 --> 01:21:25.546
It's true.
I was quite the contortionist.

01:21:25.714 --> 01:21:28.757
I could do this thing. I could go...
I mean, my leg all the way...

01:21:28.925 --> 01:21:31.218
Stop. Can you stop?
Don't show me.

01:21:31.386 --> 01:21:34.471
- Can you not see that I'm a mess?
- No, you're not, Olive.

01:21:34.639 --> 01:21:36.390
You're wonderful.

01:21:36.933 --> 01:21:39.101
And you'll handle this
the same way I did.

01:21:39.269 --> 01:21:41.729
With an incontrovertible
sense of humor.

01:21:43.023 --> 01:21:45.441
But you're much smarter than I am...

01:21:45.609 --> 01:21:48.694
...so you'll come out of this
much better than I did.

01:21:51.448 --> 01:21:52.615
Thank you, Mom.

01:21:53.950 --> 01:21:58.454
- I could get my leg so far back.
- No, no, no. Stop it.

01:21:58.622 --> 01:22:01.457
<i>So it was time to put an end</i>
<i>to all this once and for all...</i>

01:22:01.625 --> 01:22:03.250
<i>... by telling my side of the story.</i>

01:22:03.418 --> 01:22:05.544
<i>And that's why I decided</i>
<i>to do this webcast.</i>

01:22:05.712 --> 01:22:08.005
So here we go.

01:22:09.633 --> 01:22:11.300
Part five.

01:22:11.468 --> 01:22:13.594
Not with a fizzle, but with a bang.

01:22:13.762 --> 01:22:17.640
<i>Today we had yet another</i>
<i>one of our ridiculous pep rallies.</i>

01:22:17.807 --> 01:22:20.976
<i>Todd convinced the band to play</i>
<i>the sexiest song in their repertoire.</i>

01:22:21.144 --> 01:22:24.730
<i>I needed to pique everyone's interest</i>
<i>to get them to go home and log on.</i>

01:22:24.898 --> 01:22:28.275
<i>I had one outfit left and I figured</i>
<i>about 30 seconds to do it.</i>

01:22:28.443 --> 01:22:31.195
<i>Plus I really wanted</i>
<i>my own awesome musical number...</i>

01:22:31.821 --> 01:22:33.864
<i>... for no apparent reason.</i>

01:22:38.578 --> 01:22:39.828
Is that Olive?

01:24:04.414 --> 01:24:06.290
This was just a free preview.

01:24:06.458 --> 01:24:12.087

01:24:12.255 --> 01:24:15.507
And I know it interferes with
the basketball game but, come on...

01:24:15.675 --> 01:24:17.760
...would you rather cheer on
the Woodchucks...

01:24:17.927 --> 01:24:20.137
...or watch me do one?

01:24:21.639 --> 01:24:24.892
What do you think you're doing?
Get to my office right now.

01:24:25.060 --> 01:24:28.687
I can't, because I have a date with the
guy I like and the rest of the school.

01:24:28.855 --> 01:24:32.066
I think before you expel me,
you might wanna talk to Mrs. Griffith...

01:24:32.233 --> 01:24:34.943
...because I think she might
talk you into letting me stay.

01:24:35.111 --> 01:24:37.613
Go, Woodchucks!

01:24:47.582 --> 01:24:50.084
And here you all are...

01:24:50.251 --> 01:24:53.128
...waiting outside the bedroom door
for me to kiss Todd...

01:24:53.296 --> 01:24:55.839
<i>... listening to me pretend</i>
<i>to have sex with Brandon...</i>

01:24:56.007 --> 01:24:58.217
<i>... paying me to lie for you...</i>

01:24:58.384 --> 01:25:00.427
<i>... and calling me</i>
<i>every name in the book.</i>

01:25:00.637 --> 01:25:03.388
<i>You know, it was just like Hester</i>
in The Scarlet Letter.

01:25:03.556 --> 01:25:06.058
<i>Except that's the one thing</i>
<i>the movies don't tell you:</i>

01:25:06.226 --> 01:25:11.438
How shitty it feels to be an outcast.
Warranted or not.

01:25:20.782 --> 01:25:22.699
How did you know I love this song?

01:25:22.867 --> 01:25:24.159
I guessed.

01:25:24.327 --> 01:25:27.746
I see you've been watching my live
webcast. It's still going on, you know.

01:25:27.914 --> 01:25:31.291
Screw them. They've had
enough of you. Figuratively speaking.

01:25:31.459 --> 01:25:34.461
I borrowed my neighbor's mower.
I came right over.

01:25:34.629 --> 01:25:35.671
That almost rhymed.

01:25:35.839 --> 01:25:38.382
I know. I spent a minute on it.

01:25:38.550 --> 01:25:40.551
I'll be right down.

01:25:42.220 --> 01:25:44.012
That's Todd.

01:25:44.180 --> 01:25:49.143
Not that I owe you guys any more
confessions, but I really like this guy...

01:25:49.310 --> 01:25:53.564
<i>... and I might even lose my virginity</i>
<i>to him.</i>

01:25:54.232 --> 01:25:56.150
I don't know when it'II happen.

01:25:56.317 --> 01:25:59.361
You know, it might be five minutes
from now or tonight...

01:25:59.946 --> 01:26:03.448
...or six months from now
or maybe on our wedding night.

01:26:03.616 --> 01:26:08.495
But the really amazing thing is,
it is nobody's goddamn business.

01:26:10.874 --> 01:26:12.249
Come on, where's she going?

01:26:12.417 --> 01:26:14.626
I thought she was going
to take her clothes off.

01:26:14.794 --> 01:26:17.337
Demi Moore took her clothes off.
This is bullshit.

01:26:17.505 --> 01:26:20.966
Come on. Are you kidding me?

01:26:22.927 --> 01:26:25.679
- Piss off.
- Come here, you punk.

01:26:28.725 --> 01:26:30.225
Jack?

01:26:58.004 --> 01:27:00.422
<i>That's a mighty snug little shelter,</i>
<i>Huck.</i>

01:27:00.590 --> 01:27:02.049
<i>I judge it's all right.</i>

01:27:02.217 --> 01:27:04.259
<i>Here, Jim, I'll take my turn</i>
<i>at steering now.</i>

01:27:04.427 --> 01:27:06.803
<i>No, that's all right, Huck.</i>
<i>I like steering.</i>

01:27:49.764 --> 01:27:51.640
Blue Devils!
