00:19.038 --> 00:20.824
Time of death,

00:20.873 --> 00:22.841
6:34 p.m.

00:24.176 --> 00:26.444
Rose.

01:14.093 --> 01:16.294
Oh, my God.

01:16.362 --> 01:19.764
I--I--I didn't see you.
I'm so sorry.

01:19.832 --> 01:21.433
You drove straight into me.

01:21.500 --> 01:24.402
I hit you? It was
a total accident.

01:24.470 --> 01:26.371
Did he tell you to make it
look like an accident?

01:26.439 --> 01:28.540
- You heard me.
- What?

01:29.692 --> 01:31.876
Uh--uh--no. I need
to call an ambulance.

01:31.944 --> 01:33.478
No, no! Don't do that.

01:34.547 --> 01:37.399
He killed Rose.
I saw it.

01:37.483 --> 01:38.950
And now he's coming after me.

01:39.018 --> 01:40.251
Who?

01:40.319 --> 01:42.287
Let me help you.

01:42.355 --> 01:43.722
I can manage.

01:43.789 --> 01:46.391
I'm 24, not 80.

01:46.459 --> 01:47.392
Um...

01:48.461 --> 01:49.394
Take this.

01:49.462 --> 01:51.329
No, no, no.
No, no, no.

01:51.397 --> 01:52.530
Sweetheart, you need it.

01:53.599 --> 01:55.033
I really could have
hurt you.

01:55.101 --> 01:57.969
I want to go home
before he gets here.

02:01.807 --> 02:03.274
Charlie.

02:03.342 --> 02:04.542
You know him.

02:04.610 --> 02:06.911
No, I--I need to get you

02:06.979 --> 02:08.613
to a hospital.

02:08.681 --> 02:11.950
I live at 105 Addison,

02:12.018 --> 02:13.785
Columbia Heights.

02:13.853 --> 02:15.320
No hospital.

02:15.388 --> 02:17.622
It's too dangerous.
He'll be there.

02:17.690 --> 02:21.459
Uh, 105 Addison. Got it.

02:22.895 --> 02:25.296
I'm--I'm Emily,
by the way.

02:25.364 --> 02:27.599
Veronica.

02:38.044 --> 02:40.345
Um, are you--are you sure
this is the right place?

02:40.413 --> 02:42.147
Where have you brought me?

02:42.214 --> 02:44.983
Well, my phone says
105 Addison.

02:45.051 --> 02:46.017
Oh, my God.

02:46.085 --> 02:48.787
I'm old.

02:50.089 --> 02:53.825
Who wrote this on my hand?

02:53.893 --> 02:55.960
Charlie.

02:57.596 --> 02:59.764
Well, no, wait.

03:08.507 --> 03:10.041
You all right, Em?

03:10.109 --> 03:11.543
I'm fine.
Can you help her, dad?

03:11.610 --> 03:12.544
Who's he?!

03:12.611 --> 03:15.280
I'm her dad.
Who are you?

03:27.359 --> 03:29.461
Did Charlie send you?

03:29.528 --> 03:32.180
Dad,
this is Veronica.

03:32.264 --> 03:34.632
You all right, Veronica?

03:34.700 --> 03:37.969
First she tries to run me
over with her car!

03:38.037 --> 03:39.771
Is that right, love?

03:42.942 --> 03:43.775
Are you hurt?

03:43.843 --> 03:46.611
Take me home.
It's not safe.

03:48.681 --> 03:50.115
Where's home?

03:50.182 --> 03:52.317
Veronica, where's home?

03:53.085 --> 03:55.587
It's, uh...

03:55.654 --> 03:58.256
It's on the tip
of my tongue.

04:00.926 --> 04:04.162
Who's this Charlie fella?

04:05.831 --> 04:09.334
He killed my sister Rose.

04:09.401 --> 04:12.003
Now he's coming after me.

04:13.739 --> 04:15.940
You think I'm crazy,

04:16.007 --> 04:17.725
imagining it.

04:17.810 --> 04:20.111
Here.

04:20.178 --> 04:22.513
Pop this on, hey?

04:27.987 --> 04:30.688
Oh...

04:32.191 --> 04:33.958
Thank you, Burt.

04:35.361 --> 04:37.862
My knight in shining armor.

04:40.166 --> 04:44.002
Always to the rescue
when I need it the most.

04:46.705 --> 04:49.040

05:26.645 --> 05:28.213
You must be hungry, too.

05:28.280 --> 05:30.215
Why don't you have
some water?

05:30.282 --> 05:31.516
It'll help you out.

05:31.584 --> 05:32.433
I, uh...

05:32.518 --> 05:34.552
I'll be right back.
All right?

05:37.523 --> 05:39.057
What happened to you?

05:40.025 --> 05:42.460
Life.

05:43.395 --> 05:44.929
Uh...

05:44.997 --> 05:47.298
I'm not wearing those.

05:47.366 --> 05:48.666
Who are you?

05:48.734 --> 05:51.135
What is this place?

05:51.203 --> 05:53.204
How did I get here?

05:53.272 --> 05:54.973
Oh, my God.

05:57.309 --> 06:00.144
Hi, Veronica.

06:00.212 --> 06:01.579
It's Emily.

06:01.647 --> 06:03.848
We brought you here,
remember?

06:03.916 --> 06:07.318
This is where my dad works.

06:09.889 --> 06:13.808
Oh, I should do that,
don't you think?

06:13.893 --> 06:16.561
Look at you, young man.

06:16.629 --> 06:19.130
Oh, God. Ah!

06:19.181 --> 06:21.366
Ah!

06:24.320 --> 06:25.653
What?

06:25.738 --> 06:27.322
Nice try. But I know
your porn face

06:27.406 --> 06:28.573
and that's not it.

06:28.641 --> 06:30.475
It's not schizophrenia.

06:30.542 --> 06:32.977
Biometrics
don't indicate drugs.

06:33.045 --> 06:35.196
It's what we originally
thought--Alzheimer's.

06:35.281 --> 06:36.547
How old is she?

06:36.615 --> 06:37.815
Late 50s to 60s.

06:37.883 --> 06:38.816
That's early onset.

06:38.884 --> 06:40.084
I mean, she's exhausted.

06:40.152 --> 06:41.986
She's been running around
for hours, the poor woman.

06:42.054 --> 06:45.290
Have one of the others
check the name Albert or Burt

06:45.357 --> 06:48.359
against the address
that she gave Emily.

06:48.427 --> 06:50.962
Don't you think this is
a matter for the police?

06:51.013 --> 06:52.563
She's got Alzheimer's,
the poor woman.

06:52.631 --> 06:54.999
Whatever she's running from
is very real to her.

06:55.067 --> 06:57.035
So either the danger's genuine

06:57.102 --> 06:58.553
or she's gonna kill herself
running.

06:58.637 --> 07:00.004
I'm not gonna give her
to the police.

07:00.072 --> 07:02.056
Don't take this
the wrong way,

07:02.141 --> 07:03.808
but who are you
to make that decision?

07:03.876 --> 07:07.412
I'm her husband, Burt.

07:07.479 --> 07:09.280
Do you know why
bruises change color?

07:09.348 --> 07:11.916
When blood vessels burst,

07:11.984 --> 07:14.786
hemoglobin leaks into the layers
of your skin to clean it up,

07:14.853 --> 07:16.921
the body sends in
clusters of white blood cells

07:16.989 --> 07:19.791
to break down the iron
and other proteins.

07:19.858 --> 07:23.561
As iron is digested,
the color changes.

07:23.629 --> 07:25.079
Are you a doctor?

07:26.665 --> 07:28.833
I was a nurse.

07:28.884 --> 07:31.402
And that's how Burt and I
first met.

07:31.470 --> 07:34.072
One night he walked into
the emergency room

07:34.139 --> 07:36.441
with a bad stomach,
doubled over in agony.

07:36.508 --> 07:40.178
But when I went to prep him,
he tried to hide the pain,

07:40.245 --> 07:42.413
acting like he didn't want
to be any trouble.

07:42.481 --> 07:44.949
He even started cracking jokes.

07:45.017 --> 07:46.451
I could see
how he was suffering

07:46.518 --> 07:49.120
but that he wanted to appear
strong in front of me

07:49.188 --> 07:50.521
for some reason.

07:50.589 --> 07:53.091
But...

07:53.158 --> 07:55.693
When I was checking
his pulse,

07:55.761 --> 07:59.998
he took both my hands,
saying...

08:00.065 --> 08:02.400
He could read in my eyes

08:02.468 --> 08:05.403
how much of a toll
my job was taking on me

08:05.471 --> 08:09.140
and that I should find
something, someone

08:09.208 --> 08:11.342
to help take
the pressure off.

08:11.410 --> 08:14.278
Let's just say...

08:14.346 --> 08:16.247
He was that someone

08:16.315 --> 08:20.852
and gave me that something
that changed my life.

08:20.919 --> 08:23.588
He...

08:23.655 --> 08:26.791
Had a way of looking
in my eyes.

08:26.859 --> 08:30.895
Funny how there really are
no accidents in life.

08:31.997 --> 08:34.365
Well, what was wrong with him?

08:42.174 --> 08:44.308
Do you know why bruises
change color?

08:44.376 --> 08:45.977
When blood vessels burst,

08:46.045 --> 08:49.497
hemoglobin leaks under
the layers of your skin...

08:49.581 --> 08:52.016
I just got off the phone
with Wallowski.

08:52.084 --> 08:53.951
Oh, yeah?

08:54.019 --> 08:55.820
I beg your pardon?
I thought she was a resource

08:55.888 --> 08:58.456
for all of us,
not just you.

08:58.524 --> 09:01.092
You know, she wrote this on her
hand to trigger her memory

09:01.160 --> 09:03.194
and it's only
tormenting her more.

09:03.262 --> 09:07.765
See? The cops would never
have thought to do that.

09:07.833 --> 09:11.035
Speaking of cops,
a Burton--

09:11.103 --> 09:13.604
a Burton
and Veronica Sloan

09:13.672 --> 09:14.939
lived at 105 Addison.

09:15.007 --> 09:18.376
They moved to an apartment
in Chevy Chase 10 years ago.

09:18.444 --> 09:21.179
Nice suburbia. That would
do anyone's head in.

09:21.246 --> 09:23.614
Burt died 3 years ago.

09:23.682 --> 09:25.149
You see what I mean?

09:27.252 --> 09:29.087
She had a younger
sister, Rose,

09:29.154 --> 09:31.589
who was found dead in
her apartment in 1968.

09:31.657 --> 09:33.091
An unsolved murder.

09:33.158 --> 09:35.093
Does it say anything
in that report

09:35.160 --> 09:39.263
about a suspect name
Charles, Charlie?

09:39.331 --> 09:41.265
There was only one
main suspect,

09:41.333 --> 09:44.102
and it was little more
than a hunch.

09:44.169 --> 09:45.937
Veronica.

09:51.076 --> 09:53.344
What's the odds my new missis

09:53.412 --> 09:56.347
forgot that part, too?

10:00.981 --> 10:02.549
Mr. Sloan.

10:02.554 --> 10:03.955
Who's asking?

10:04.033 --> 10:05.433
Mr. Gus Sloan?

10:05.501 --> 10:07.702
I told you already,
I'm doing my best

10:07.770 --> 10:09.337
to scrape the payment
together. I--

10:09.405 --> 10:10.872
there's really no need
to come to my house.

10:10.940 --> 10:13.508
We found your brother's widow

10:13.576 --> 10:15.910
wandering around alone

10:15.978 --> 10:17.512
late at night.

10:17.580 --> 10:19.681
Excuse me? What--

10:19.749 --> 10:21.616
Mind if I come in?

10:21.684 --> 10:23.184
She's fine, by the way.

10:23.252 --> 10:24.719
Do you have a badge
I can see?

10:24.787 --> 10:26.755
We're not police
officers, Mr. Sloan.

10:26.822 --> 10:29.658
We're just trying to help
your sister-in-law.

10:29.725 --> 10:30.592
Good samaritans.

10:30.660 --> 10:32.027
No, that's her department.

10:32.094 --> 10:33.862
Me, I got a teenage daughter

10:33.929 --> 10:36.398
who almost ran over
that nice lady last night,

10:36.465 --> 10:39.000
and she's a little bit
distressed, which has a way

10:39.068 --> 10:40.702
of getting me going.

10:40.770 --> 10:42.203
You know what I mean?

10:42.271 --> 10:43.872
When did Veronica
move out?

10:43.939 --> 10:45.774
Um...

10:47.243 --> 10:49.878
You look sad,

10:49.945 --> 10:51.046
Mr. Sloan.

10:51.113 --> 10:53.882
When I say sad,
what I really mean is ashamed.

10:55.117 --> 10:57.218
You play the piano?

10:57.286 --> 11:00.622
No, that was Veronica's.

11:00.690 --> 11:04.426
Look, I don't know if you've ever
committed a family member into care--

11:04.493 --> 11:06.428
My grandfather. I know what you're
going through,

11:06.495 --> 11:07.829
and I'm sorry.

11:07.897 --> 11:10.699
So, um, where
did she move to?

11:10.766 --> 11:14.369
Uh, Horizons Extended
Care andResidence.

11:14.437 --> 11:15.770
Well, did they call you when
she went missing?

11:15.838 --> 11:17.639
This is the first I'm
hearing of it, obviously.

11:17.707 --> 11:20.275
'Cause if they had...

11:20.342 --> 11:23.311
Right, you'd be
way more worried.

11:23.379 --> 11:26.681
I'm sorry. You knock
on my door at dawn

11:26.749 --> 11:27.749
and I invite you into--

11:27.817 --> 11:28.850
Veronica's home?

11:28.918 --> 11:29.918
Former home.

11:29.985 --> 11:32.187
And you didn't invite us in,

11:32.254 --> 11:33.121
I barged in.

11:33.189 --> 11:34.956
I mean, let's get
that bit right.

11:35.024 --> 11:39.027
Mr. Sloan, Veronica thinks someone's
trying to kill her.

11:39.095 --> 11:40.195
Oh.

11:40.262 --> 11:41.496
Charlie, right?

11:41.547 --> 11:42.697
You know him?

11:42.765 --> 11:46.167
No, but it's not the first
time the name's come up.

11:46.235 --> 11:48.970
Charlie is some kind
of figment

11:49.038 --> 11:50.939
of Veronica's imagination.

11:51.006 --> 11:54.375
Gus, I, for one,

11:54.443 --> 11:56.177
believe her.

11:57.379 --> 11:58.880
So what's going on, then,

11:58.948 --> 12:01.149
some kind of garage
sale, is it?

12:01.217 --> 12:04.385
She gonna get any of the cash
that you get from her stuff?

12:04.453 --> 12:06.287
I mean, her piano, you know?

12:06.355 --> 12:09.591
She went through
all the money

12:09.658 --> 12:11.159
Burt left her.
I had to take

12:11.227 --> 12:14.095
a reverse mortgage on this
place to pay for her care.

12:14.163 --> 12:15.663
My Uncle...

12:15.731 --> 12:18.666
Was, you know,
put into care.

12:18.734 --> 12:19.768
At the end,

12:19.835 --> 12:22.137
even on his deathbed,

12:22.204 --> 12:26.207
there were things
that he never, ever forgot.

12:28.677 --> 12:30.545
Veronica's ill...

12:31.580 --> 12:33.815
Not paranoid.

12:35.151 --> 12:37.185
I think I got this right.

12:37.253 --> 12:38.353
Ready?

12:38.404 --> 12:40.405
Man, on recording:
Today is March 10, 1968.

12:40.489 --> 12:43.775
This is Detective Montrose
interviewing Veronica Sloan.

12:43.859 --> 12:47.362
Did your sister Rose have enemies,
anyone who'd want to hurt her?

12:47.429 --> 12:49.364
Not at all.
Everyone loved her.

12:49.431 --> 12:51.199
What about you, Veronica?
Do you love Rose?

12:51.267 --> 12:52.801
How can you ask that?

12:52.868 --> 12:55.603
I'd trade places
in a heartbeat if I could.

12:55.671 --> 12:56.971
The only thing I hear
is survivor's guilt.

12:57.039 --> 12:58.306
Ok, let's go over
your statement.

12:58.374 --> 13:00.141
When was the last time
you saw Rose?

13:00.209 --> 13:02.076
That morning.
We met for coffee

13:02.144 --> 13:03.478
for about an hour.

13:03.546 --> 13:05.146
And you never saw her
after that?

13:05.214 --> 13:06.147
No.

13:06.215 --> 13:07.649
Hear the difference
in response speed

13:07.716 --> 13:09.284
the no was quicker.
Between those two answers?

13:09.351 --> 13:10.819
People get frustrated,
don't they?

13:10.886 --> 13:12.921
Especially
if they're innocent.

13:12.988 --> 13:15.423
Frustration has a sharper edge.

13:15.491 --> 13:18.493
Did you hear how emotional
she was earlier in the tape?

13:18.561 --> 13:20.295
That last no was rehearsed.

13:20.362 --> 13:23.832
Veronica knew something.

13:25.568 --> 13:27.435
Do you know
where you are, Veronica?

13:27.486 --> 13:29.337
I don't remember
this place, Burt,

13:29.405 --> 13:32.273
but it smells awfully
like a hospital to me.

13:36.412 --> 13:39.113
Hello, Veronica.

13:39.181 --> 13:41.616
Come on.

13:41.684 --> 13:43.117
Who is that?
Do you know who he is?

13:43.185 --> 13:45.186
No, I've never
seen him before, but...

13:45.254 --> 13:46.988
What are you doing here?

13:47.056 --> 13:49.557
I came to see Veronica.
Is that a problem?

13:49.625 --> 13:51.392
Hi, Veronica.

13:53.362 --> 13:56.297
I'm sorry, have we met?

14:09.979 --> 14:10.912
You're not Burt.

14:10.980 --> 14:12.413
No, I'm not, love, no.

14:12.481 --> 14:14.282
But I am a friend.

14:14.350 --> 14:17.252
This is my daughter
Emily.

14:24.960 --> 14:26.494
Dr. Lightman.

14:26.562 --> 14:27.795
Dr. Joshua Hamill.

14:27.863 --> 14:28.863
How do you do?

14:28.931 --> 14:29.847
Hello, Veronica.

14:29.932 --> 14:31.566
I was worried about you.

14:31.634 --> 14:33.401
But you're home now.

14:33.469 --> 14:36.337
Dr. Lightman, I can't thank you enough
for bringing her back.

14:36.405 --> 14:39.107
I have Alzheimer's,
don't I, Dr. Hamill?

14:39.174 --> 14:43.027
Can I talk to you
for a minute, outside?

14:44.313 --> 14:45.947
I'm only 60.

14:46.015 --> 14:48.533
Did you know that?

14:48.617 --> 14:51.519
Can we hold off
on those, just for a minute?

14:51.570 --> 14:53.788
I want her thinking straight
for a while longer.

14:53.855 --> 14:57.492
Lucidity is never a given
at this stage, I'm sorry to say.

14:57.559 --> 14:59.761
Vincent Olson,
resident psychiatrist.

14:59.828 --> 15:00.695
Right you are.

15:00.763 --> 15:02.797
Well, she's lucid now.

15:02.865 --> 15:04.232
Uh, Dr. Lightman,

15:04.300 --> 15:06.200
uh, Alzheimer's patients
like Veronica

15:06.268 --> 15:08.636
need their meds,
or there's a possibility

15:08.704 --> 15:11.472
they could hurt themselves
and/or the staff.

15:11.540 --> 15:13.675
Veronica could use
some companionship,

15:13.742 --> 15:16.611
and, uh, I'm sure a few more hours
medication-free shouldn't hurt.

15:16.679 --> 15:19.280
As long as there's a good
reason, I'll sign off.

15:19.348 --> 15:22.183
Well, when we found her,

15:22.251 --> 15:24.319
she was running away
from somebody called Charlie

15:24.386 --> 15:25.987
she says she saw
kill her sister.

15:26.055 --> 15:27.789
Her sister died in 1968.

15:27.856 --> 15:30.491
No, her sister
was killed in 1968.

15:30.559 --> 15:32.694
And she was a suspect.

15:32.761 --> 15:34.996
So...What are you saying?

15:35.064 --> 15:37.332
Well, she thinks she saw
Charlie kill her sister

15:37.399 --> 15:39.567
and now she's afraid
he's coming after her.

15:39.635 --> 15:41.035
Now, I can help her
with that.

15:41.103 --> 15:43.638
More than those pills.

15:56.301 --> 15:58.586
That's Rose.

16:05.594 --> 16:07.362
Is that you and Burt?

16:07.429 --> 16:10.565
No, that's someone else.

16:12.434 --> 16:14.268
Someone that hurt you,
right?

16:21.276 --> 16:24.579
You were engaged
to someone before Burt.

16:24.646 --> 16:26.881
What happened, love?

16:58.047 --> 17:00.615
Charlie Eaton.

17:04.053 --> 17:05.953
Charlie?

17:06.003 --> 17:09.589
Veronica Sloan says
you killed her sister.

17:09.657 --> 17:11.626
Are you from the home?

17:11.676 --> 17:13.877
It must have been
right about the same time

17:13.962 --> 17:16.047
as you went to Vietnam.

17:19.017 --> 17:21.335
Bit of a coincidence,
though, don't you think?

17:21.403 --> 17:25.173
I mean, your fiancee's sister
getting killed on the same day

17:25.240 --> 17:27.474
that you signed up for duty.

17:27.542 --> 17:32.113
You get off my property
right now, whoever you are.

17:32.181 --> 17:36.451
What happened
between you and Veronica, then?

17:37.920 --> 17:40.455
That's none of your
damn business.

17:43.659 --> 17:45.660
You missed a bit.

17:45.727 --> 17:48.596
Body language
shows overt affection

17:48.664 --> 17:51.065
between Veronica,
Charlie, and Rose.

17:51.133 --> 17:52.967
You're missing the most
obvious bit, you know?

17:53.035 --> 17:55.203
Two months later,
all that is gone.

17:55.270 --> 17:56.771
No warmth between
Veronica and Charlie.

17:56.839 --> 17:58.806
Rose can't even
look at her sister.

17:58.874 --> 18:00.975
All right, stop trying
to read the faces for a sec

18:01.043 --> 18:02.577
and just use
your bloody eyes, all right?

18:02.644 --> 18:04.712
You could just tell us
instead of belittling our work.

18:04.780 --> 18:07.949
All right,
push in on that one.

18:08.984 --> 18:11.085
See, that's why Charlie
lost his touch

18:11.153 --> 18:12.820
with the rake today.

18:12.888 --> 18:15.289
I mean, she's not even aware
that she's rubbing her tummy.

18:15.357 --> 18:18.693
And what were little more than
bee stings 2 months earlier

18:18.760 --> 18:21.779
are now dead heat
in a zeppelin race.

18:21.864 --> 18:23.998
Lovely. Thank you.

18:24.066 --> 18:25.933
I'll bet her ankles
are swollen.

18:26.001 --> 18:29.070
I'll bet she's, you know,
busting for a pee.

18:30.339 --> 18:32.673
She's pregnant.

18:33.542 --> 18:34.909
Genius.

18:45.220 --> 18:48.489
You were engaged to Veronica,
right?

18:48.557 --> 18:51.058
But you got her sister
up her duff.

18:51.126 --> 18:53.728
Pregnant, in layman's terms.

18:53.795 --> 18:55.163
You got 5 seconds
to get off this property

18:55.230 --> 18:56.497
before I go get my shotgun.

18:56.565 --> 18:59.600
Veronica's got Alzheimer's.

18:59.668 --> 19:03.538
She's convinced that you
killed her sister Rose.

19:03.605 --> 19:05.323
What, you gonna run away
again, are you,

19:05.407 --> 19:08.042
'cause I can see you got something
to say about all of this.

19:08.110 --> 19:09.310
Are you a cop?

19:09.378 --> 19:10.845
No, I'm not.

19:10.913 --> 19:12.713
Authority issues?

19:12.781 --> 19:14.282
You got a name?

19:14.349 --> 19:15.716
Lightman.

19:15.784 --> 19:19.153
She thinks
I'm her husband Burt.

19:19.221 --> 19:21.289
I hear he was a good man.

19:21.356 --> 19:22.623
Good husband.

19:22.691 --> 19:26.394
She was hard to forget,
I would imagine.

19:30.599 --> 19:33.351
You have no idea.

19:34.203 --> 19:35.369
Yeah.

19:35.437 --> 19:39.240
It was a one-time thing
with Rose.

19:39.308 --> 19:40.875
A mistake.

19:40.943 --> 19:43.211
Well, that would be
some great swimmers

19:43.278 --> 19:44.946
and some lousy luck.

19:48.884 --> 19:50.985
I promised
I'd do right by her.

19:51.053 --> 19:53.521
But when Veronica
found out,

19:53.589 --> 19:56.424
she and the rest of the family,
they wanted to kill me.

19:56.491 --> 19:59.827
So you ran away

19:59.895 --> 20:01.829
to Vietnam.

20:01.897 --> 20:04.799
I didn't kill Rose,
Mr. Lightman.

20:04.866 --> 20:07.702
But you're saying
Veronica did?

20:07.769 --> 20:09.770
Where do you get that?

20:10.606 --> 20:12.640
Right there.

20:17.433 --> 20:19.913
So, you think her Alzheimer's

20:19.940 --> 20:21.674
is masking her guilt, do you?

20:21.741 --> 20:23.676
Well, that's a new one.

20:23.743 --> 20:25.911
Rose betrayed Veronica.

20:25.979 --> 20:27.346
You need to face facts.

20:27.414 --> 20:31.183
It's quite possible
Veronica killed her.

20:33.019 --> 20:34.687
You think...

20:34.754 --> 20:38.257
I mean,
it's strong as an ox.

20:38.325 --> 20:40.993
Do you think I should let
Emily drive it?

20:41.061 --> 20:42.161
'Cause it's very...

20:42.229 --> 20:43.162
Fancy.

20:43.230 --> 20:44.830
Powerful.

20:44.898 --> 20:46.498
Don't tell me it hasn't
crossed your mind.

20:46.566 --> 20:49.401
I mean, you know, Alzheimer's
affects short-term memory first.

20:49.452 --> 20:51.036
Long-term memory is
often the last to go.

20:51.104 --> 20:54.306
Oh, so that's what's
happening to her, is it?

20:54.374 --> 20:55.574
Where are you going?

20:56.743 --> 20:58.744
Veronica's old place.

20:58.812 --> 21:01.213
And you're gonna pick her up and
you're gonna bring her there.

21:01.281 --> 21:03.215
What, to see Gus?

21:03.283 --> 21:04.783
No, to resurrect Burt.

21:15.762 --> 21:17.062
Veronica.

21:17.130 --> 21:19.531
Can I get your coat?

21:20.734 --> 21:22.868
Darling, how are you?

21:22.936 --> 21:25.137
Who are you?

21:25.205 --> 21:28.374
Where's Burt?

21:28.441 --> 21:30.075
Uh...

21:30.944 --> 21:33.412
Can I get you a drink?

21:33.480 --> 21:36.649
It's a Manhattan, right?

21:36.716 --> 21:38.183
I think I might be
out of cherries.

21:38.251 --> 21:40.352
Oh, no, it's all taken care of.
Don't worry.

21:40.420 --> 21:43.222
Well, come through.
Take a seat.

21:44.291 --> 21:45.724
Ohh!

21:45.792 --> 21:48.060
Carnations. My favorite.

21:48.128 --> 21:49.428
Oh, Burt! Ha ha!

21:49.496 --> 21:51.063
You shouldn't have.

21:51.131 --> 21:54.300
Well, you two, you just sit
and get to know each other.

21:54.351 --> 21:56.435
One Manhattan coming.

21:57.671 --> 22:01.006
I sure hope you two
know what you're doing.

22:01.074 --> 22:02.875
Yeah, me, too.

22:04.110 --> 22:06.145
No cherry for Burt.

22:10.417 --> 22:12.017
Burt?

22:12.085 --> 22:14.787
What happened to my piano?

22:14.854 --> 22:16.521
Drinks all around.

22:16.573 --> 22:18.357
There you go.

22:18.425 --> 22:19.958
One for you.

22:20.026 --> 22:21.393
Thank you.

22:22.429 --> 22:25.264
So, in 1968,

22:25.332 --> 22:28.500
when you were interviewed
about Rose's death,

22:28.568 --> 22:31.103
why didn't you
tell the truth?

22:33.206 --> 22:36.241
Who's this woman
in my house, Burt?

22:37.077 --> 22:39.044
This is a friend of mine.

22:39.112 --> 22:41.013
In my house?

22:41.081 --> 22:43.716
You think I don't know
what's going on?

22:43.783 --> 22:45.918
You were jealous
of Rose and Charlie

22:45.985 --> 22:47.319
back then,
weren't you?

22:47.387 --> 22:49.388
Cal.
Just like you're jealous now.

22:49.456 --> 22:53.926
Charlie killed them all, Burt.

22:53.993 --> 22:56.228
Rose, Natalie,

22:56.296 --> 22:58.297
Bob Urqhart,

22:58.365 --> 23:01.500
and the neighbor,
Mrs. Baird.

23:02.902 --> 23:05.571
Rose didn't want to have
Charlie's baby.

23:05.638 --> 23:08.974
No, you didn't want her
to have his baby.

23:20.820 --> 23:23.489
There was this woman I knew.

23:26.726 --> 23:29.995
Said she could
take care of things.

23:33.767 --> 23:37.035
Rose died having a...

23:39.272 --> 23:40.973
An...

23:44.444 --> 23:47.246
I was a nurse.

23:47.313 --> 23:49.681
I knew better.

24:09.819 --> 24:11.470
Here.

24:18.077 --> 24:20.879
This is just
soda water, Burt.

24:22.081 --> 24:24.716
With a cherry on top.

24:25.685 --> 24:28.420
Ok. Thanks.
I appreciate it.

24:31.691 --> 24:32.958
You saw that, right?

24:33.026 --> 24:34.526
The contempt for Charlie?

24:34.594 --> 24:37.796
Yeah. But she hates herself
more than she hates Charlie.

24:37.864 --> 24:40.365
She killed her sister
trying to abort his baby.

24:40.433 --> 24:42.534
Really? Are you sure
about that?

24:42.602 --> 24:44.203
All right, then.
Out with it.

24:44.270 --> 24:47.039
You seem to have changed your mind
about her illness masking her guilt.

24:47.106 --> 24:48.040
I disagree.

24:48.107 --> 24:49.141
Disagree with what?

24:49.209 --> 24:51.310
That what we do
doesn't work better

24:51.377 --> 24:52.711
'cause we agree
all the time.

24:52.779 --> 24:54.947
Yeah, but that's not
what I'm talking about.

24:55.014 --> 24:58.417
Back in 1968, Veronica thought she
was doing the right thing. Right?

24:58.485 --> 24:59.985
And it's still killing her.

25:00.053 --> 25:01.987
Before you say we should
go to the police on this,

25:02.055 --> 25:03.489
I beg to differ on that.

25:03.556 --> 25:05.324
You make me so mad
sometimes.

25:05.391 --> 25:07.926
I know.

25:07.994 --> 25:09.795
Anything else?

25:11.064 --> 25:14.032
So I made
a couple of calls.

25:14.100 --> 25:16.502
And Mrs. Baird is alive and well
and living in Boston.

25:16.569 --> 25:18.837
And Mr. Urqhart

25:18.905 --> 25:21.673
died in a helicopter crash
in 1999.

25:21.741 --> 25:25.777
So she's mixing up people from the
present with people from the past.

25:25.845 --> 25:27.946
Including Charlie?

26:00.713 --> 26:04.283

All right?

26:39.852 --> 26:43.021
It's a motorcycle
accident.

26:43.089 --> 26:44.389
Oh, yeah.

26:44.457 --> 26:46.825
26 years old.

26:46.893 --> 26:50.095
Been in a coma
8 months they say.

26:50.163 --> 26:53.265
You a relative
of Veronica's?

26:53.333 --> 26:55.801
Now and then, yeah.

26:55.868 --> 26:57.486
Frank Stoll.

26:57.570 --> 26:58.704
How do you do?

26:58.771 --> 27:00.038
Can't tell you how much

27:00.106 --> 27:03.141
she lifted my daughter's
spirits.

27:03.209 --> 27:05.110
Gretchen died last night.

27:05.178 --> 27:07.312
I'm sorry.

27:07.380 --> 27:09.147
Uh, she, uh...

27:09.215 --> 27:11.483
Wanted Veronica to have this.

27:11.551 --> 27:12.484
She painted it herself.

27:12.535 --> 27:14.252
Yeah.

27:14.320 --> 27:15.387
It's a rose.

27:15.455 --> 27:17.856
It's what Veronica
always called her.

27:17.924 --> 27:20.125
It's her sister's name.

27:42.448 --> 27:45.050
12 residents dead
in the last 6 months,

27:45.118 --> 27:47.886
including Gretchen,
who was only 17.

27:51.758 --> 27:53.258
Well, thank you.

27:53.326 --> 27:55.761
Veronica, love,

27:55.828 --> 27:58.296
do you know these people?

27:58.364 --> 28:00.265
Mrs. Baird.

28:03.903 --> 28:05.771
Natalie.

28:06.873 --> 28:08.974
Bob Urqhart.

28:16.015 --> 28:19.284
Rose.

28:21.821 --> 28:23.555
Thanks, love.

28:25.608 --> 28:28.560
All people from this place.

28:28.628 --> 28:31.463
So the Charlie she's
scared of is in here,

28:31.531 --> 28:32.998
somewhere,

28:33.066 --> 28:34.833
killing people.

28:39.270 --> 28:40.803
Dr. Hamill.

28:41.488 --> 28:42.939
Sorry I'm late.
I had a meeting

28:42.982 --> 28:45.367
and it ran over for
a couple of minutes, you know?

28:45.451 --> 28:47.018
20 minutes.

28:47.086 --> 28:48.100
What, you got a tee time
or something?

28:48.391 --> 28:49.891
You call me here
to your fishbowl

28:49.959 --> 28:51.226
to accuse me
of incompetence

28:51.293 --> 28:53.345
and you keep me
waiting 20 minutes.

28:53.429 --> 28:56.031
No one's accused you
of anything yet.

28:56.098 --> 28:59.684
Do you always enjoy
this level of antagonism?

28:59.769 --> 29:02.170
Yes! Yeah.

29:02.238 --> 29:04.139
It's like oxygen to me.

29:04.206 --> 29:05.874
Dr. Hamill.

29:05.941 --> 29:07.008
Hi.

29:07.076 --> 29:10.445
Angels of death follow
a very specific pathology.

29:10.513 --> 29:14.382
Angel of death.
Is that what you think this is?

29:14.450 --> 29:17.018
They take pleasure
in power over others,

29:17.086 --> 29:18.520
a God complex.

29:20.489 --> 29:23.925
I've been practicing
medicine for 20 years--

29:23.993 --> 29:25.126
Then you'd know the type.

29:25.177 --> 29:27.896
Someone with an intimate
knowledge of medicine.

29:27.963 --> 29:29.798
Don't you think I would know

29:29.865 --> 29:32.333
if one of my employees
was killing patients?

29:32.401 --> 29:35.370
Your patients are dropping
like flies...Doctor.

29:35.438 --> 29:37.439
How long do you want to
continue with the small talk?

29:37.506 --> 29:39.641
Ok, I've read
the autopsy reports,

29:39.709 --> 29:41.710
in detail.

29:41.777 --> 29:44.028
The deaths
you are talking about

29:44.113 --> 29:46.715
are all unrelated.

29:46.782 --> 29:49.384
That kind
of emphatic denial

29:49.452 --> 29:50.885
with stress on every word

29:50.953 --> 29:53.822
is a sign of condescending
deception, doctor.

29:53.889 --> 29:58.226
There's no angel
of death on my staff.

29:58.294 --> 29:59.761
Do you vet everyone

29:59.829 --> 30:01.296
that you hire
personally?

30:01.363 --> 30:02.297
Yes.

30:02.364 --> 30:03.565
Good.

30:03.632 --> 30:06.067
I want total access.

30:06.135 --> 30:07.569
Residents...

30:07.636 --> 30:09.704
Staff.

30:13.926 --> 30:17.078
Did you ever get angry
at a patient?

30:17.146 --> 30:19.547
Ever have a bedpan
emptied on you?

30:19.615 --> 30:22.917
Do you ever feel happy
when a resident dies?

30:22.985 --> 30:26.755
Relieved, sometimes.

30:26.822 --> 30:29.390
It's complicated.

30:29.458 --> 30:31.092
You must know.

30:31.160 --> 30:33.244
I used to get upset.

30:33.329 --> 30:36.097
But after a while, you just
get used to it, you know?

30:36.165 --> 30:37.499
The deaths.
The next day

30:37.566 --> 30:38.933
at your kid's soccer game,

30:39.001 --> 30:42.587
you just put it
out of your mind.

30:42.671 --> 30:45.340
One thing these people
all have in common

30:45.407 --> 30:46.808
is professional numbness.

30:46.876 --> 30:51.146
You know, like cops
and gallows humor.

30:54.116 --> 30:55.817
I've got this one.

30:55.885 --> 30:57.385
What's your name?

30:57.453 --> 30:58.653
Frazier.

30:58.721 --> 31:00.221
Why can't I talk to her?

31:00.289 --> 31:02.390
You like what you do,
Frazier?

31:02.458 --> 31:03.491
I need my job.

31:03.559 --> 31:05.894
You know what I mean,
in a straight answer?

31:05.961 --> 31:08.396
I bring the stink of horizon
home with me every day.

31:08.464 --> 31:10.231
Shower twice just
to scrub it all out.

31:10.299 --> 31:12.734
I shaved my head 'cause there ain't
enough shampoo in the world.

31:12.802 --> 31:14.302
Is that straight enough
for you?

31:14.370 --> 31:16.871
And yet you still love
what you do?

31:16.939 --> 31:18.740
Those people, yeah.

31:18.808 --> 31:20.909
Every day I learn
something new from them.

31:20.976 --> 31:22.243
Such as?

31:22.311 --> 31:23.745
Life is short.

31:23.813 --> 31:26.614
Let's just say, you disrespect
them, you disrespect me.

31:26.682 --> 31:28.183
How long you worked there?

31:28.250 --> 31:29.584
6 years.

31:29.652 --> 31:31.619
You ever think
about quitting?

31:31.687 --> 31:34.155
Not so long as there's
patients who want to fight, no.

31:34.223 --> 31:37.592
You're the only person
that we've talked to

31:37.660 --> 31:39.894
that loves what they do.

31:39.962 --> 31:42.497
Then you think I'm crazy,
right?

31:42.565 --> 31:43.398
Bonkers.

31:43.465 --> 31:46.000
Yeah. But that's
another story.

31:48.170 --> 31:52.140
Is there anyone else there
that cares like you do?

31:52.208 --> 31:54.442

32:47.463 --> 32:50.965
Sometimes
they just surrender.

32:54.503 --> 32:56.604
You believe that, do you?

32:58.941 --> 33:00.541
Neither do I.

33:00.609 --> 33:04.445
There comes a time when they
should be allowed to just go.

33:04.513 --> 33:06.881
What about this one?

33:06.949 --> 33:09.884
Did she want to...Go?

33:09.952 --> 33:12.186
Or did she want to fight?

33:13.889 --> 33:17.525
Or don't you know for sure?

33:18.627 --> 33:20.528
Have a think.

33:20.596 --> 33:22.563
Get back to me.

33:47.467 --> 33:49.401
She looks so peaceful.

33:50.213 --> 33:51.613
Doesn't she?

33:51.681 --> 33:54.383
You really helped her,
you know.

33:54.450 --> 33:56.618
Put her mind at rest.

33:56.686 --> 33:58.220
Or the best you could.

33:58.287 --> 34:01.723
Playing the role of her husband
Burt when she really needed it.

34:01.791 --> 34:03.621
I want to thank you for that.

34:03.721 --> 34:05.922
Are you thanking me
on her behalf?

34:07.458 --> 34:11.828
Oh, I just came
to say goodbye.

34:11.896 --> 34:13.929
I'm going to leave
you two alone now.

34:13.998 --> 34:16.199
You robbed a man
of his daughter.

34:16.266 --> 34:19.135
And then you just move on.

34:19.203 --> 34:20.603
How many times
have you done this?

34:20.670 --> 34:23.306
If you're talking
about Gretchen Stoll,

34:23.373 --> 34:24.641
what if I were
to tell you

34:24.708 --> 34:26.909
that she needed a lot
more than her father?

34:26.976 --> 34:28.645
More than her earthly
father, you mean.

34:28.712 --> 34:30.730
Imagine being
so riddled with disease,

34:30.815 --> 34:32.482
you can't respond.

34:32.550 --> 34:34.250
Every day a living hell.

34:34.318 --> 34:36.652
Wouldn't you want someone
to come along

34:36.719 --> 34:39.621
and bring a peaceful,
dignified end to your pain?

34:39.690 --> 34:41.658
Someone play God?

34:41.725 --> 34:43.059
What do you think
doctors are doing

34:43.127 --> 34:45.829
when they put a preemie
in an Incubator?

34:45.896 --> 34:49.165
Or conversely,
perform an abortion

34:49.233 --> 34:52.235
or put someone in a vegetative
state on life support?

34:52.303 --> 34:55.004
We play God
in many different ways.

34:55.072 --> 34:57.607
What about all the other
people you killed?

34:57.675 --> 35:01.344
I mean, did you ask
their permission?

35:01.412 --> 35:05.148
This is a hypothetical
discussion, Dr. Lightman.

35:05.216 --> 35:09.586
I beg your pardon,
did we get our wires crossed?

35:22.733 --> 35:24.801
Charlie.

35:26.103 --> 35:28.238
That's the trigger.

35:30.074 --> 35:31.407
The white coat
is the trigger.

35:31.475 --> 35:33.776
She thinks you're Charlie,

35:33.844 --> 35:36.746
who she blamed
for her sister's death.

35:37.581 --> 35:39.582
I...

35:39.650 --> 35:41.484
Killed Rose...

35:42.620 --> 35:44.821
Trying to abort
your baby.

35:44.889 --> 35:47.624
I know you know, and now
you want to kill me.

35:47.691 --> 35:50.260
Veronica, I'm a doctor.

35:50.327 --> 35:52.495
My job is to help you.

35:52.563 --> 35:56.132
Can you ever forgive me
for what I did, Charlie?

35:56.200 --> 35:57.300
Yes.

35:57.368 --> 36:01.271
Of course I forgive you,
Veronica.

36:01.338 --> 36:03.940
But the question is,

36:04.008 --> 36:06.175
can he?

36:24.562 --> 36:26.129
What are you doing?

36:26.180 --> 36:28.097
Emily let me in.

36:28.165 --> 36:30.733
Oh, yeah?

36:30.801 --> 36:34.237
I brought you your usual.

36:38.642 --> 36:40.610
What are we drinking to,
then?

36:40.677 --> 36:45.148
Well, I came here
to thank you.

36:46.383 --> 36:47.550
For what, exactly?

36:47.618 --> 36:50.086
For this.

36:50.154 --> 36:53.022
For taking away my desk.

36:53.090 --> 36:54.791
How'd you get that thing?

36:54.858 --> 36:56.709
Call it research.

36:56.794 --> 36:57.994
All right.

36:59.330 --> 37:01.731
You were trying
to be like me, were you?

37:01.799 --> 37:03.933
Oh, you wish.

37:06.937 --> 37:11.374
I thought you was
on the hunt for a new job.

37:11.442 --> 37:14.277
Yeah, well...

37:14.345 --> 37:16.012
You heard about
the economy, right?

37:16.080 --> 37:18.448
Oh, yeah.

37:19.883 --> 37:23.786
You know, research...

37:23.854 --> 37:26.089
Almost killed me

37:26.156 --> 37:28.791
once or twice.

37:28.859 --> 37:29.959
Papua, New Guinea?

37:30.027 --> 37:31.361
Papua, New Guinea?

37:31.428 --> 37:35.298
Downtown, D.C.

37:35.366 --> 37:40.036
You do what we do right,

37:40.104 --> 37:42.839
it's gonna hurt.

37:46.210 --> 37:48.077
Don't push it.

37:48.145 --> 37:49.445
Yeah.

37:59.690 --> 38:01.524
Hello, Mark.

38:01.592 --> 38:05.594
It's Dr. Olson.

38:05.646 --> 38:08.765
Everything's
gonna be all right.

38:19.209 --> 38:20.943
Goodbye, Mark.

38:38.720 --> 38:42.322
God works
in mysterious ways, eh?

38:42.390 --> 38:45.992
You just gave him
saline solution.

38:46.044 --> 38:48.929
You should learn
to keep your office locked.

38:48.997 --> 38:50.998
You think I enjoy this.

38:52.600 --> 38:56.770
You just made a unilateral
decision to end a life.

38:59.307 --> 39:01.775
And prevent pain.

39:02.610 --> 39:04.978
Shame on you.

39:09.017 --> 39:12.552
You don't have to worry about
Charlie anymore. He's gone.

39:12.620 --> 39:13.921
Who's Charlie?

39:13.988 --> 39:17.491
Someone you don't need
to worry about, darling.

39:19.627 --> 39:22.996
Oh. You leaving?

39:23.865 --> 39:24.898
Off to work.

39:24.966 --> 39:27.601
Well, you--you'll be back
for dinner, though?

39:27.669 --> 39:29.269
Soon.

39:29.337 --> 39:32.005
We brought something
for you.

39:35.443 --> 39:37.911
My piano.

40:12.413 --> 40:15.849
All those 911 calls.

40:15.917 --> 40:17.684
I never believed her.

40:17.752 --> 40:19.453
I gave up on her.

40:19.520 --> 40:21.688
You're doing
everything you can.

40:45.680 --> 40:46.613
You ok?

40:46.664 --> 40:49.116
You need to stop that.
Come on.

41:27.955 --> 41:29.623
You like your phone,
do you?

41:29.690 --> 41:32.025
Uh, yeah. Why?

41:32.093 --> 41:33.560
What about this car?
You like this car?

41:33.628 --> 41:35.395
Sure.

41:35.463 --> 41:37.197
Which one
do you like best?

41:37.265 --> 41:39.900
It's not really a matter
of liking, dad.

41:39.967 --> 41:41.134
It's a matter of necessity.

41:41.202 --> 41:42.569
It's necessity, is it?

41:42.637 --> 41:43.870
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

41:43.938 --> 41:45.572
That makes me the plonker,
then, does it?

41:45.640 --> 41:47.274
You're acting weird, dad.

41:47.341 --> 41:49.876
Are you ok?
Is this about Veronica?

41:49.944 --> 41:52.696
Nice try.

41:53.714 --> 41:55.532
Well, I mean,
did you ever

41:55.616 --> 41:57.818
hold mom's hands that way?

41:57.869 --> 42:00.454
I miss her, too, dad.

42:00.521 --> 42:02.789
Pick one
for the next month.

42:02.857 --> 42:04.424
One what?

42:04.492 --> 42:06.326
The phone or the car.
Pick one.

42:11.899 --> 42:15.135
Hey, Liam. Um, would you mind
picking me up at my house?

42:15.203 --> 42:16.203
Liam?

42:16.270 --> 42:17.437
Liam?
Ok.

42:17.505 --> 42:19.172
Sorry, that's my dad.

42:19.240 --> 42:22.209
Uh, yeah, ok, see you soon.

42:22.276 --> 42:24.811
New chauffeur.

42:26.681 --> 42:28.315
You think this is funny,
do you?

42:28.382 --> 42:32.752
Uh, thanks for helping
Veronica.

42:32.820 --> 42:34.721
It--it really meant
a lot to me.

42:34.789 --> 42:36.456
Don't do that.

42:36.524 --> 42:37.991
Do what?

42:38.059 --> 42:39.025
That.

42:39.093 --> 42:40.827
'Cause I'm angry with you.

42:40.895 --> 42:42.963
I know.

42:43.030 --> 42:45.365
And--and I'm sorry.

42:45.433 --> 42:47.234
Really.

42:51.706 --> 42:53.540
Come on.
