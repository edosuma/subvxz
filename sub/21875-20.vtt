I just know he is.

00:54.780 --> 00:56.220
He's one heck
of a driver, all right.

00:56.220 --> 00:59.220
I taught him to shift gears
on that old tractor of mine.

00:59.220 --> 01:01.790
He crashed into your barn
the first time you let him solo.

Yeah.

I guess you'll pay off
your rig now.

02:26.310 --> 02:27.740

Yeah, fooled them again.

Listen, I'm lookin' for a load.
I really need one today.

03:25.030 --> 03:26.130
Got any ideas?

03:26.140 --> 03:27.670
No, I'm lucky
to have one myself.

03:27.670 --> 03:30.140
There's a load
of alfalfa cubes

03:30.140 --> 03:31.710

to Wichita.

03:31.710 --> 03:34.370
Just talk to Ben
over at P&G Freight.

03:34.380 --> 03:35.910
Yeah, I'll do that, Callie.
Thanks.

03:35.910 --> 03:37.280
Sure.

Maybe tomorrow,
but not today.

a three-hour delay.

Damn.

03:55.400 --> 03:57.330
I got to be there
by sundown.

03:57.330 --> 03:58.800
Hey, no big deal.

03:58.800 --> 04:01.100
Why don't you take
the 171 cutoff.

04:01.100 --> 04:02.600
That'll run you down
through Hubbard.

04:02.600 --> 04:05.640
Then catch the 31, it'll deliver
you back to the 35

04:05.640 --> 04:07.570
just north of Waco.

04:08.580 --> 04:09.780
Thanks, Callie.

but you're either gonna have
to go back the way you came

06:38.360 --> 06:39.790
or take the detour.

06:39.790 --> 06:41.130
What's the detour?

06:41.130 --> 06:42.900
The old quarry road here.
It'll bring you back

You guys aren't going
to get away with this.

You know, they didn't
even have truck rodeos

09:42.680 --> 09:45.510
when I was pushin'
a rig years ago.

09:45.510 --> 09:47.810
I didn't know you drove
trucks back then.

09:47.820 --> 09:49.850
Yeah.
Is that when
they ran on steam?

09:49.850 --> 09:52.320
Did I ever tell you about
the time that I lost my brakes

09:52.320 --> 09:53.620
on the St. George grate?

09:53.620 --> 09:55.220
No, but I'm sure
you're getting ready to.

09:55.220 --> 09:57.490
Well, I had a load of sticks
comin' out of Provo.

09:57.490 --> 09:59.930
I hit the top
of the gorge comin' down.

09:59.930 --> 10:02.500
Excuse me, C.D.
I'm sorry to bother you, Walker,

10:02.500 --> 10:04.360
but it's about Buddy.
What happened?

10:04.370 --> 10:06.070
That's just it.
I don't know.

10:06.070 --> 10:08.670
He always calls to say
when he's coming home.

10:08.670 --> 10:10.500
He didn't call?
No.

10:10.510 --> 10:12.240
He should have been
heading back

10:12.240 --> 10:13.640
from Corpus Christi
hours ago.

10:13.640 --> 10:14.910
Maybe he broke down.

10:14.910 --> 10:17.180
Not the way he keeps
his rig tuned.

10:17.180 --> 10:18.850
There's more.

10:18.850 --> 10:20.510
I just got a call
from the dispatcher.

10:20.520 --> 10:22.250
He said that Buddy
never delivered his load.

10:22.250 --> 10:23.720
He was awful mad.

10:23.720 --> 10:25.380
He said he was going
to call the police

10:25.390 --> 10:27.090
and report Buddy
for hijacking it.

10:27.090 --> 10:29.690
C.D.
Shoot. He wouldn't do
a thing like that.

10:29.690 --> 10:31.190
I hate to say this,
Linda,

10:31.190 --> 10:33.160
but maybe he had
an accident.

10:33.160 --> 10:34.930
Could you check for me?

10:34.930 --> 10:36.430
Yeah, I'll check.
Look,

10:36.430 --> 10:37.930
why don't you go
sit by the phone

10:37.930 --> 10:40.100
and we'll call you as soon
as we find out anything. Okay?

10:40.100 --> 10:41.530
Okay.

10:41.540 --> 10:43.170
Don't worry.

10:43.940 --> 10:45.110
Thanks, Walker.

All right. Yeah, thanks.

has no record

No Buddy Skyhawk

10:59.420 --> 11:01.290
No record of Skyhawk's rig
comin' through

11:01.290 --> 11:03.090
the weigh station
on the interstate either.

11:03.090 --> 11:05.790
That means he had to turn off
before he got there.

11:05.790 --> 11:07.030
Why?

11:07.030 --> 11:08.290
Gotta come through Austin,

11:08.300 --> 11:10.830
that's a straight shot
down the interstate.

11:10.830 --> 11:14.700
Well, the only other route
is the Hubbard turnoff.

11:14.700 --> 11:16.370
Let's take a ride.

11:18.340 --> 11:20.540
(<i> slow country theme playing</i> )

11:43.630 --> 11:45.160
All right,
why would he take the cutoff?

11:45.170 --> 11:48.070
That would add two, what,
three hours to the trip, right?

11:49.570 --> 11:51.370
Look at this, Trivette.

11:53.610 --> 11:55.610
There were flares
across this road.

11:58.610 --> 12:01.010
I'll call in and find out
what accident they had out here.

12:01.020 --> 12:02.980
Okay.

12:06.250 --> 12:07.350
Yeah,
this is Trivette.

12:07.360 --> 12:08.790
DISPATCHER:
<i> Go ahead, Ranger.</i>

12:08.790 --> 12:10.990
Yeah, we're out
at the 171.

12:10.990 --> 12:13.360
You got any accidents
in the last 48 hours out here?

<i> No, Ranger. State police</i>
<i> report nothing in that area.</i>

12:24.710 --> 12:27.440
No reports of accidents
in this area.

12:29.540 --> 12:31.610
A heavy rig went down
this dirt road.

12:34.750 --> 12:36.680
Why would it do that?

12:36.690 --> 12:38.650
Let's find out.

13:23.730 --> 13:25.600
The rig slammed on
its brakes here.

13:25.600 --> 13:27.230
Looks like
they locked up.

13:34.010 --> 13:35.770
Looks like the big rig
was cut off

13:35.780 --> 13:39.210
by another vehicle coming
from the other direction.

13:40.520 --> 13:42.550
The fatter tire's
probably a pickup.

13:42.550 --> 13:44.280
Four by four.

13:45.290 --> 13:46.550
Judging from the footprints,

13:46.550 --> 13:47.690
three men in it.

13:47.690 --> 13:48.750
Four.

13:57.300 --> 13:59.370
Hey, looks like we got
another vehicle

13:59.370 --> 14:01.800
stopping the rig
from behind,

14:01.800 --> 14:02.840
with two men in it.

14:02.840 --> 14:03.900
Yeah, I know.

14:06.310 --> 14:10.210
All right, that's seven men
altogether.

14:10.210 --> 14:13.680
But only one of 'em's
wearing cowboy boots.

14:15.080 --> 14:17.750
Buddy Skyhawk
wears cowboy boots.

14:17.750 --> 14:19.220
So do we,

14:19.220 --> 14:21.720
and half of Texas.

14:47.850 --> 14:50.020
(<i> country theme playing</i> )

15:01.630 --> 15:03.500
Trivette!

15:16.780 --> 15:18.240
Is he alive?

15:18.250 --> 15:19.880
Barely!

15:19.880 --> 15:22.280
Get a medevac chopper
here now!

15:25.820 --> 15:27.990
Hang in there, Buddy.

15:31.860 --> 15:34.060
( siren wailing )

15:36.730 --> 15:38.200
He's a strong boy, honey.

15:38.200 --> 15:40.700
and I'm sure--
I'm sure he'll be okay.

15:41.870 --> 15:43.700
You just wait here
with me.

15:43.700 --> 15:45.200
Did you find out
anything?

15:45.210 --> 15:47.210
Checked the police
impound yards,

15:47.210 --> 15:49.640
truck stops,
maintenance centers.

15:49.640 --> 15:51.610
No sign of the rig?

15:51.610 --> 15:53.850
Like it vanished
off the face of the earth.

15:55.920 --> 15:57.580
How's Buddy?

15:57.590 --> 15:59.690
They're still
working on him.

16:01.160 --> 16:02.150
( sighs )

16:02.160 --> 16:03.660
Let's get out of here.

16:03.660 --> 16:06.230
Nothing we can do.

16:06.230 --> 16:07.690
You said "hot"?

16:07.700 --> 16:09.700
That truly offends me,
because I'll tell you why.

16:09.700 --> 16:12.100
The fact is, my brother-in-law
owns a pawnshop.

16:12.100 --> 16:14.100
Business is booming.
I'm just helping him out here.

16:14.100 --> 16:16.100
Now, I got a terrific buy
on an eight-speed blender.

16:16.100 --> 16:17.570
Still in the box.
No?

16:17.570 --> 16:19.040
Okay, uh, how about

16:19.040 --> 16:21.310
a .45 automatic, huh?

16:21.310 --> 16:24.340
Can't be too careful, a lot
of bad guys around these days.

16:24.350 --> 16:27.050
You, sir, you look like
a portable CD type of guy.

16:27.050 --> 16:29.180
Am I right? Am I right?
Hey, take a look at this.

16:29.180 --> 16:30.680
Where are you going?
Hey, check it out.

16:30.680 --> 16:31.950
We're just getting started.

16:31.950 --> 16:33.320
What's the matter?
Deer rifles.

16:33.320 --> 16:34.390
Aagh!

16:34.390 --> 16:36.060
Hello, Cobalt.

16:36.060 --> 16:37.790
Oh.

16:37.790 --> 16:40.690
Rangers Walker and Trivette.
What a pleasant surprise.

16:40.690 --> 16:42.760
Nice to see you again.
Nice to see you again.

16:42.760 --> 16:44.000
Uh, Y-You got my hand--

16:44.000 --> 16:45.360
Right where I want it.

16:45.370 --> 16:47.530
I thought we agreed you wouldn't
do this anymore, Cobalt.

16:47.540 --> 16:48.800
This was the last time.

16:48.800 --> 16:50.070
Honest, sort of

16:50.070 --> 16:51.940
a "going out of business" sale.
Yeah, that's it.

16:51.940 --> 16:54.010
How am I gonna explain this
to your parole officer?

16:54.010 --> 16:56.540
Because I think he's gonna be
very unhappy with you.

16:56.540 --> 16:58.840
Come on, Trivette,
give me a break just this once.

16:58.850 --> 17:00.410
All right?
Up the trunk, please.

17:00.420 --> 17:02.850
Soon as you tell us who hijacked
a load of computers.

17:02.850 --> 17:04.720
Computers? Gee, you got me.

17:06.490 --> 17:08.420
Heh-heh. Yeah, we do.

17:08.420 --> 17:10.859
Okay, okay, look.
I was tellin' the truth, honest.

17:10.859 --> 17:12.730
I know somebody that bought
a bunch of computers

17:12.730 --> 17:13.730
just this morning.

17:13.730 --> 17:15.359
What kind?
Bellwood Electronics,

17:15.359 --> 17:16.500
top of the line.

17:16.500 --> 17:18.530
Keep going.
Ouch!

17:18.530 --> 17:20.670
The Cuadroza brothers,
all right? They got a trunkful.

17:20.670 --> 17:23.000
They're gonna sell 'em on
the black market in Guadalajara.

17:23.000 --> 17:24.240
Where are they located?

17:24.240 --> 17:26.109
I'll write the address down
immediately.

17:26.109 --> 17:27.310
Please let me, huh?

17:27.310 --> 17:30.280
Aagh! Geez!

17:33.050 --> 17:34.610
( men speaking indistinctly )

17:45.890 --> 17:48.790
MAN:
Hold on a minute, boys.

17:48.800 --> 17:50.530
We're looking
for Manny Cuadroza.

17:50.530 --> 17:51.560
Texas Rangers.

17:51.570 --> 17:53.570
Yeah? What do
you want him for?

17:55.770 --> 17:57.370
Well, if you're Manny,

17:57.370 --> 17:59.670
we want to know who sold you
these computers.

17:59.670 --> 18:01.740
I've got nothing to say.

18:01.740 --> 18:04.280
It's either here
or downtown.

18:04.280 --> 18:05.680
Haagh!

18:15.690 --> 18:17.320
( glass shattering )

18:21.460 --> 18:23.100
Now do you feel
like talking?

18:23.100 --> 18:24.560
Yeah. Yeah, sure.

18:24.570 --> 18:26.230
I wanna know
who hijacked those computers?

18:26.230 --> 18:27.230
<i> ¿Quien sabes?</i>

18:27.240 --> 18:29.000
You know how it works
on the street.

18:29.000 --> 18:31.570
Some middleman gives you a call,
cash changes hands,

18:31.570 --> 18:33.140
and they tell you where
to pick it up.

18:33.140 --> 18:34.470
I never saw
the hijackers.

18:34.480 --> 18:36.480
What did you see?
Nothing.

18:36.480 --> 18:38.380
Only thing I know
is they're bad.

18:38.380 --> 18:40.150
And they're here
to do big business.

18:42.350 --> 18:44.980
(<i> melancholy theme playing</i> )

18:44.990 --> 18:46.750
( heart monitor beeping )

18:53.130 --> 18:54.790
( weakly ):
Walker,

18:54.800 --> 18:56.000
is that you?

18:56.000 --> 18:58.030
Yeah, it's me, Buddy.

18:58.030 --> 18:59.230
They took my load.

18:59.230 --> 19:00.530
Yeah, I know.

19:01.740 --> 19:03.800
How did they get you
on the old quarry road?

19:03.800 --> 19:06.440
Cops had a roadblock.

19:06.440 --> 19:07.870
Cops?

19:10.410 --> 19:11.710
Cops were involved?

19:14.150 --> 19:17.420
I think it started
at the South Fork truck stop.

19:17.420 --> 19:20.450
I saw a green van
out of my back door.

19:20.450 --> 19:22.290
Okay, just take it easy,
Buddy.

19:22.290 --> 19:23.420
We'll check into it.

19:23.420 --> 19:25.490
By the way,

19:25.490 --> 19:27.530
I've got something
for you.

19:28.860 --> 19:30.330
It saved your life, Buddy.

19:30.330 --> 19:32.000
It stopped the bullet.

19:33.230 --> 19:34.970
I told you
it was good luck.

19:34.970 --> 19:36.570
Yeah, you did.

19:48.680 --> 19:51.920
Cops, roadblocks...

19:51.920 --> 19:53.950
Think he's delirious?

19:54.990 --> 19:57.460
Well, maybe.

19:57.460 --> 19:58.860
I think I know
a way to find out.

19:58.860 --> 20:01.090
Are you crazy?

20:01.100 --> 20:02.390
What's so crazy
about it?

20:02.400 --> 20:05.660
All I'm asking for is a rig
and 100 TV sets.

20:05.670 --> 20:07.330
And where am I supposed
to get the money?

20:07.340 --> 20:09.300
From your sting fund.

20:09.300 --> 20:10.840
What if they don't even
take the bait?

20:10.840 --> 20:13.540
I mean, how are they gonna know
about this shipment?

20:15.740 --> 20:17.440
Oh, no.

20:17.450 --> 20:19.280
Not him again.

20:19.280 --> 20:21.350
You know, that's--
That's gratitude.

20:21.350 --> 20:22.750
When I risked my life
for you.

20:22.750 --> 20:25.150
WALKER:
Okay, Cobalt,
here's the deal.

20:25.150 --> 20:27.550
I want you to put the word out
in the street

20:27.560 --> 20:29.520
that you can broker
100 TV sets

20:29.520 --> 20:32.060
and that your client
is willing to pay top dollar

20:32.060 --> 20:33.530
if he can take delivery
by tomorrow.

20:33.530 --> 20:35.930
Yeah.
W-What's in it for me?

20:35.930 --> 20:37.800
You get to have
your merchandise back.

20:37.800 --> 20:40.330
Hey, come on, man, look,
I am a man of honor, okay.

20:40.330 --> 20:41.430
Huh?

20:41.440 --> 20:43.700
Hey, Earl, get "His Honor"
out of here.

20:44.970 --> 20:47.170
EARL:
Come on, let's go.

20:50.880 --> 20:52.850
So who's gonna drive the truck?

20:55.120 --> 20:56.680
( mock crying )

20:57.450 --> 20:58.720
WALKER:
No, Trivette,

20:58.720 --> 21:00.650
when you downshift,
you have to double-clutch.

21:00.650 --> 21:02.720
Okay, okay.

21:02.720 --> 21:04.690
Okay, now apply the brakes
gently.

21:04.690 --> 21:06.290
( tires screeching )

21:09.560 --> 21:11.060
Well, that wasn't
too bad,

21:11.070 --> 21:13.400
but your "gently"
needs a little work.

21:23.440 --> 21:24.910
How many times
do I have to tell you?

21:24.910 --> 21:26.310
Pretend like
you're going uphill.

21:26.310 --> 21:27.450
Don't yell at me!

21:27.450 --> 21:28.480
You're making
me nervous.

21:28.480 --> 21:30.080
Who's making who nervous?

21:30.820 --> 21:32.420
( horn honks )

21:32.420 --> 21:33.720
You're doing all right.

21:35.690 --> 21:37.660
But you can
lose the horn.

21:54.280 --> 21:55.370
( sighs )

21:56.810 --> 21:58.580
Not bad, Trivette.

21:58.580 --> 21:59.950
Well, is it over?

21:59.950 --> 22:01.550
Now I'd like
to see you back up.

22:01.550 --> 22:03.150
Oh, I gotta back up?

22:03.150 --> 22:05.020
Well, you should be able to.
It's easy.

22:05.020 --> 22:07.150
It's how easy?

22:07.150 --> 22:09.720
Well, it's like, um...

22:09.720 --> 22:12.390
rollerblading backwards
through a revolving door,

22:12.390 --> 22:14.230
carrying three sets of skis.

22:14.230 --> 22:16.460
Walker, I got a comment
and a question.

22:16.460 --> 22:17.630
What?

22:17.630 --> 22:19.200
One, I hate your guts.

22:19.200 --> 22:21.470
Two, why can't
you drive this tonight?

22:21.470 --> 22:24.470
Because my face has been
splattered all over the news.

22:24.470 --> 22:26.570
Now, what's the first thing
you do when you back up?

22:26.570 --> 22:28.110
Pray.

22:28.110 --> 22:31.110
Look in your rearview mirror.

22:58.870 --> 23:00.410
You're late.

23:00.410 --> 23:02.540
Sorry, Frank, I--
"Sorry" is between

23:02.540 --> 23:05.680
"spit" and "sympathy"
in the dictionary, Callie.

23:05.680 --> 23:07.410
You wanna be
part of this outfit,

23:07.410 --> 23:09.980
you damn sure better be here
when the meeting starts.

23:12.050 --> 23:14.290
So, what do you got
for us?

23:14.290 --> 23:17.390
Um, I got a reefer of pork,
plumbing fixtures

23:17.390 --> 23:19.790
and a load of steel,
but that's iffy.

23:19.790 --> 23:21.790
That's not good enough!

23:21.800 --> 23:25.300
I told you I want things that
I can turn over in 12 hours.

23:25.300 --> 23:27.870
Keep your ears open for liquor
and television sets, Callie.

23:27.870 --> 23:29.940
I got major buyers
waiting for both.

23:29.940 --> 23:31.070
Okay.

23:31.070 --> 23:33.140
Okay, well, what about
those computers?

23:33.140 --> 23:35.540
Oh, yeah.

23:35.540 --> 23:37.210
Yeah.

23:37.210 --> 23:39.780
Worked out real nice.

23:39.780 --> 23:41.250
Here's your cut.
Ten grand.

23:41.250 --> 23:43.520
We pass out the shares
at the beginning of the meeting.

23:43.520 --> 23:46.220
Sort of an incentive
to get here on time.

23:46.220 --> 23:49.620
You didn't hurt that driver,
did you?

23:49.620 --> 23:52.090
Buddy Skyhawk,
he's a nice guy.

23:52.090 --> 23:54.330
Trust me, Callie.

23:54.330 --> 23:56.460
He didn't feel a thing.

23:56.460 --> 23:58.300
Oh, God, Frank, I--

23:58.300 --> 24:01.130
Hey! You came to me
with your sad story

24:01.140 --> 24:02.870
about getting your butt
pinched by guys

24:02.870 --> 24:05.240
with initials
for first names.

24:05.240 --> 24:07.610
Welcome to the club,
sweetheart.

24:09.340 --> 24:11.710
Liquor and television sets,
Callie.

24:11.710 --> 24:14.480
You get that through
your birdbrain, airhead?

24:14.480 --> 24:16.350
Yeah.

24:19.320 --> 24:21.450
Hey, good buddy,
comin' up on a truck stop.

24:22.690 --> 24:24.090
Okay, go ahead,
and pull on in.

24:25.830 --> 24:27.690
( gears grinding )

24:33.500 --> 24:35.370
And don't hit the pumps.

24:36.300 --> 24:38.140
( tires screech )

24:38.140 --> 24:40.540
Easy for you to say.

24:45.850 --> 24:47.350
Yes, sir?

24:47.350 --> 24:50.010
Well, fill 'er up, good buddy.
I'll be back in a second.

24:50.020 --> 24:52.650
Got a load of TVs bound
for San Antone in there.

24:52.650 --> 24:53.720
( clicks tongue )

24:53.720 --> 24:55.490
Okay.

25:00.290 --> 25:02.900
♪ Yes, I'm an ol' cowhand ♪

25:02.900 --> 25:05.760
Boys, the bears are bad
out there tonight.

25:05.770 --> 25:08.330
Seen at least 10 of 'em
on my way in from Denton.

25:08.340 --> 25:10.870
Yeah, them Smokeys are gettin'
thick as thieves out there.

25:10.870 --> 25:14.110
No doubt about that.
Uh, what you hauling?

25:14.110 --> 25:16.380
I got enough TVs on board
to make couch potatoes

25:16.380 --> 25:18.640
out of half of San Antone.
( laughs )

25:18.650 --> 25:20.950
MAN: Who you hauling for?
Independent out of Tulsa.

25:20.950 --> 25:23.150
Thank you very much, ma'am.
What else can I get you?

25:23.150 --> 25:24.780
Uh, could you wrap up
a couple of bear claws

25:24.790 --> 25:25.890
and fill that up for me.

25:25.890 --> 25:27.990
Say, they got
any extra loads you know about?

25:27.990 --> 25:30.620
I really need one,
I-- I do.

25:30.620 --> 25:32.120
Well,
not that I know of.

25:32.130 --> 25:33.960
Can you tell me
the fastest way into San Antone?

25:33.960 --> 25:35.290
San Antone?

25:35.300 --> 25:37.160
Yes, sir, I haven't been
out this way a long time.

25:37.160 --> 25:38.160
I usually run into K.C.

25:38.170 --> 25:39.500
Well, best way
to get to San Antone

25:39.500 --> 25:42.000
is just get on I-35
and go south

25:42.000 --> 25:43.800
as far as you can get
till you get there.

25:43.800 --> 25:45.670
Hey, Chilton, you might wanna
check with Farley.

25:45.670 --> 25:47.370
I thought I overheard him
saying something

25:47.370 --> 25:49.910
about needing someone to ride
shotgun with him tonight.

25:49.910 --> 25:52.310
Oh. That's good, Callie.
Thank you. Yeah.

25:52.310 --> 25:53.650
Well, my friend,

25:53.650 --> 25:54.880
keep them
between the ditches.

25:54.880 --> 25:57.280
Yes, sir,
Chilton.

25:57.280 --> 25:58.280
Your hat there.

25:58.290 --> 25:59.720
Oh, thanks.

25:59.720 --> 26:02.290
Well, you think those Smokeys
were heavy south of Denton,

26:02.290 --> 26:06.290
wait till you see them on the 35
between here and Waco tonight.

26:06.290 --> 26:07.460
Is that right?

26:07.460 --> 26:10.230
I'd avoid it if you need
to make good time.

26:11.430 --> 26:13.370
I do need
to make good time.

26:13.370 --> 26:14.870
CALLIE:
Take the Hubbard cutoff.

26:14.870 --> 26:18.270
You know,
Highway 171 to the 31?

26:18.270 --> 26:19.870
That ought to give you
pedal to the metal

26:19.870 --> 26:21.410
right into Waco.

26:21.410 --> 26:23.070
Thank you.

26:23.080 --> 26:24.980
I appreciate that.
Here, keep the change.

26:24.980 --> 26:28.080
Mm,
thank you.

26:33.990 --> 26:36.190
(<i> suspenseful country theme</i>
<i> playing</i> )

26:38.030 --> 26:39.690
Yeah.

26:43.530 --> 26:45.100
Pleasure doing business
with you.

26:45.100 --> 26:46.930
And thank you.

26:57.540 --> 26:59.040
Bird Dog to Hammer.

26:59.050 --> 27:02.710
We got us
a real fat rabbit.

27:18.830 --> 27:21.000
Walker, that van
is still following me.

27:21.000 --> 27:23.340
Good. Looks like
the hook is set.

27:23.340 --> 27:24.870
I think the waitress
at the truck stop's

27:24.870 --> 27:26.010
the one that baited me.

27:26.010 --> 27:28.170
Could be.

27:28.180 --> 27:30.710
All right, the Hubbard cutoff's
coming up in a half a mile.

27:30.710 --> 27:31.710
What lane you in?

27:31.710 --> 27:33.280
<i> Middle.</i>

27:33.280 --> 27:34.480
Move over now.

27:34.480 --> 27:36.050
All right.

27:36.050 --> 27:37.050
( tires screeching )

27:37.050 --> 27:38.520
( horn honking )

27:40.620 --> 27:42.520
Trivette,
get a grip.

27:42.520 --> 27:44.490
You said "now."

27:52.130 --> 27:53.930
Bird Dog to Dragnet,
we got a go.

27:53.930 --> 27:56.340
Rabbit's moving
toward the cutoff.

27:56.340 --> 27:58.470
Should be easy.
He looks like he's drunk.

28:21.530 --> 28:23.660
( siren wailing )

28:30.440 --> 28:32.100
Bird Dog to Dragnet.
Scrub the operation.

28:32.110 --> 28:34.510
He's coming right towards you
with a real Smokey on his tail.

28:50.960 --> 28:52.120
What's going on
up there?

28:52.130 --> 28:54.430
A patrol car's
stopping us.

28:54.430 --> 28:57.500
All right, Buddy said cops were
involved, so be careful.

28:57.500 --> 28:58.900
All right.

29:09.010 --> 29:10.410
( door opens )

29:12.510 --> 29:15.910
DISPATCHER ( on radio ): <i> </i>
<i> West Hill Unit 1, Lincoln-</i>

29:15.920 --> 29:17.880
( dispatcher continues
indistinctly )

29:22.060 --> 29:23.720
What seems to be
the problem, officer?

29:23.720 --> 29:25.790
License and registration.

29:25.790 --> 29:27.890
Step down out of the rig,
please.

29:40.310 --> 29:41.340
Have you been drinking?

29:41.340 --> 29:43.210
No, I haven't
been drinking.

29:45.610 --> 29:48.650
Straight line,
heel to toe.

29:48.650 --> 29:49.650
Great.

29:49.650 --> 29:50.650
Great.

29:50.650 --> 29:52.620
(<i> pensive theme playing</i> )

29:54.560 --> 29:57.590
Stand square,
put both hands out to your side.

29:59.290 --> 30:02.430
Left hand, right hand,
right hand, left hand.

30:02.430 --> 30:04.630

30:04.630 --> 30:08.630
M-I-S-S-I-S-S-I-P-P-I.

30:08.640 --> 30:11.000
Very good.
Thank you.

30:11.010 --> 30:13.410
No. Thank you, officer.

30:13.410 --> 30:15.840
Guess you were telling
the truth about not drinking.

30:15.840 --> 30:17.040
Yeah, yeah.

30:17.040 --> 30:19.680
But I am gonna write you up
for reckless driving.

30:23.180 --> 30:25.850
Have a good evening,
you hear?

30:29.760 --> 30:30.990
You--

30:30.990 --> 30:33.260
( engine starts )
Oh.

30:38.630 --> 30:40.430
What happened?

30:40.430 --> 30:41.930
Got a damn ticket.

30:41.940 --> 30:43.270
( sighs )

30:43.270 --> 30:45.900
You didn't want me
to blow our cover.

30:45.910 --> 30:46.910
( sighs )

30:46.910 --> 30:48.710
Bad break, dang it.

30:48.710 --> 30:49.980
We probably
scared them off.

30:50.780 --> 30:52.140
So, what do we do now?

30:53.210 --> 30:54.350
I'll think of something.

30:54.350 --> 30:56.280
No chance.
Absolutely not.

30:56.280 --> 30:57.750
You blew your budget.

30:57.750 --> 30:59.250
Alex,
we were this close.

30:59.250 --> 31:00.590
C.D.:
Are you brain-dead?

31:00.590 --> 31:02.590
What in the hell
ever possessed you

31:02.590 --> 31:04.490
to let him drive a truck
in the first place?

31:04.490 --> 31:05.660
Hey!

31:05.660 --> 31:07.490
I mean, really.
You broke my operational bank.

31:07.490 --> 31:09.260
Five thousand dollars

31:09.260 --> 31:10.860
on the truck
and trailer rental,

31:10.870 --> 31:15.400
plus $30,000 in damages
from Phil the TV King?

31:15.400 --> 31:17.400
Cordell, I should've
been driving that truck.

31:17.400 --> 31:19.770
You may not know this, but I
can push one of them big rigs.

31:19.770 --> 31:20.970
I never will forget
one time

31:20.980 --> 31:23.710
I was on a little old road
in Arkansas,

31:23.710 --> 31:25.310
just winding
through the mountains,

31:25.310 --> 31:26.980
slicker than a gut,
rain everywhere--

31:26.980 --> 31:30.920
C.D., are you sure
you'd like to drive?

31:30.920 --> 31:32.750
Oh, you bet
your bottom dollar I would.

31:32.750 --> 31:35.390
If you're willing to drive, I
think I know where to get a rig.

31:36.760 --> 31:38.760
Where are you
gonna get the truck?

31:38.760 --> 31:42.360
At the impound. Dallas P.D. just
confiscated one this morning.

31:43.460 --> 31:45.030
But there is
just one other thing.

31:45.030 --> 31:46.670
Yeah?
What is that?

31:46.670 --> 31:48.200
Didn't you just get
a load of liquor?

31:49.140 --> 31:50.500
Yeah, I mean...

31:50.500 --> 31:53.810
So what?

31:53.810 --> 31:55.470
I'd like to load the rig
with your liquor.

31:55.480 --> 31:56.470
Oh, no...

31:56.480 --> 31:57.810
( chuckles )

31:57.810 --> 31:59.280
W-Wait a minute.

31:59.280 --> 32:00.780
If we lose
that damn load of liquor,

32:00.780 --> 32:02.080
I'm in hell of a lot
of trouble.

32:02.080 --> 32:03.720
Now, what's going to happen
to the liquor?

32:03.720 --> 32:04.820
You're gonna be driving.

32:04.820 --> 32:08.250
If you're gonna be
in the trailer...

32:08.250 --> 32:09.920
why does it
have to be loaded?

32:09.920 --> 32:11.720
I don't wanna take it
over the scale empty,

32:11.730 --> 32:12.990
in case
someone's watching.

32:14.290 --> 32:17.700
Well, that-- That makes--
That makes sense.

32:17.700 --> 32:20.300
Besides that, I'm not gonna be
in back of the truck.

32:20.300 --> 32:21.300
Trivette is.

32:22.570 --> 32:24.500
No end
to the persecution.

32:24.510 --> 32:26.270
I'll be following you guys
in my truck.

32:26.270 --> 32:28.270
Trivette, you still have
that tracking device

32:28.280 --> 32:29.670
that you keep
wanting me to use?

32:29.680 --> 32:31.480
Satellite
triangulation?

32:31.480 --> 32:33.950
Yeah, I could follow a rat
through a wall if I wanted to.

32:33.950 --> 32:34.980
Well, it better.

32:34.980 --> 32:36.650
I want to take
down the whole operation

32:36.650 --> 32:37.980
instead of just the hijackers.

32:37.990 --> 32:39.550
Don't bust them
on the road.

32:39.550 --> 32:40.820
Bust them
on their home turf.

32:40.820 --> 32:41.990
You got it.

32:41.990 --> 32:43.120
That's bright.

32:43.120 --> 32:44.720
So why don't you two guys
go pick up the rig

32:44.730 --> 32:46.060
and load the liquor.

32:46.060 --> 32:49.260
I'll talk to Cobalt
about putting the word out, hm?

32:49.260 --> 32:52.560
Cordell, wait
just a minute, will you?

32:52.570 --> 32:54.830
Now, you're sure that liquor's
going to be all right?

32:54.840 --> 32:59.040
C.D., nothing will happen
to your liquor.

32:59.040 --> 33:01.370
( people chattering )

33:08.820 --> 33:10.680
( sighs )

33:14.120 --> 33:16.590
Coffee and
a few kind words, honey.

33:16.590 --> 33:18.820
We'll start with some coffee.
Thank you.

33:18.830 --> 33:20.090
Can I top that off for you?

33:20.090 --> 33:22.230
You bet.

33:22.230 --> 33:24.500
Haven't seen you
through here before.

33:25.570 --> 33:28.100
I generally run west
out of Denver.

33:28.100 --> 33:29.370
Hm, who you hauling for?

33:29.370 --> 33:31.000
Orsenoff Brothers.

33:31.010 --> 33:33.010
The liquor wholesaler.

33:33.010 --> 33:35.340
C.D.:
I'm taking over
for their southbound driver.

33:35.340 --> 33:36.340
He's getting married.

33:36.340 --> 33:38.410
This guy weighs
about 120 pounds,

33:38.410 --> 33:40.310
about 6 foot 4 inches tall.

33:40.310 --> 33:42.610
Wouldn't make a racket
trotting on dry leaves.

33:42.620 --> 33:45.780
He's marrying this little old
gal about 5 foot tall,

33:45.790 --> 33:48.990
She weighs about 5 pounds less
than a baby grand piano.

33:48.990 --> 33:49.990
Life's funny,
ain't it?

33:49.990 --> 33:52.890
Yeah.
You know, I just heard...

33:52.890 --> 33:54.630
traffic's really bad.

33:54.630 --> 33:56.290
It's a three-hour delay.

33:56.300 --> 33:58.360
I hear it's like a parking lot
up at the scales.

33:58.370 --> 33:59.360
The scales?

33:59.370 --> 34:00.530
It's bad.

34:00.530 --> 34:01.800
Oh.

34:03.770 --> 34:05.300
There is a way
around it,

34:05.310 --> 34:06.570
if you're
interested.

34:06.570 --> 34:07.970
Tell me about it.

34:07.970 --> 34:09.570
Well, you just go down
Route 131 to...

34:52.989 --> 34:54.820

35:11.040 --> 35:13.300
There's a green van on your
back door, C.D. See him?

35:15.210 --> 35:16.810
Yeah.
Yeah, I got him.

35:16.810 --> 35:19.410
Okay, I'm pulling out.

35:19.410 --> 35:21.310
Cordell,
they're sending me

35:21.310 --> 35:24.320

they sent Buddy and Jimmy.

41:33.790 --> 41:34.790
You all right?

41:34.790 --> 41:36.020
Yeah, I'm okay.

41:36.020 --> 41:38.560
You take them down
to the old post road, cap them,

41:38.560 --> 41:40.120
drop their bodies
in that mine shaft

41:40.130 --> 41:41.890
we used
for the gas-truck driver.

41:41.900 --> 41:43.360
It was almost a full minute

41:43.360 --> 41:44.830
before I heard that dude
hit bottom.

41:44.830 --> 41:47.400
You think that was a fall?
Let's see how hard you go down.

41:47.400 --> 41:49.330
Don't do it,
Jimmy, don't.

41:51.870 --> 41:54.270
You the best thing
they could throw at us?

41:54.270 --> 41:57.410
Yeah, we'll be in business
for a long time.

41:57.410 --> 41:58.410
( chuckles )

41:58.410 --> 42:00.140
(<i> ominous theme playing</i> )

42:04.720 --> 42:05.720
What the--?

42:07.550 --> 42:08.820
( men shout indistinctly )

42:09.560 --> 42:10.720
( grunts )

42:16.660 --> 42:18.500
No! No!
Not that way!

42:18.500 --> 42:20.300
( glass breaking )
Oh, no!

42:23.370 --> 42:25.200
No, not again, please!

42:28.740 --> 42:30.310
( clicks )

42:34.650 --> 42:38.080
He's out of bullets.
Let's go get him.

42:52.830 --> 42:53.930
( engine starts )

43:04.440 --> 43:05.640
( grunts )

44:26.330 --> 44:28.090
Cordell, just
look what's happened

44:28.090 --> 44:29.930
to that truckload
of booze!

44:29.930 --> 44:31.300
I'm sorry about that, C.D.

44:31.300 --> 44:34.500
You promised me
that nothing would happen!

44:34.500 --> 44:36.770
Can't be right
every time.

44:36.770 --> 44:39.640
Looks like Eliot Ness
has been here.

44:41.570 --> 44:43.870
And, doggone it, don't y'all
be running off anywhere.

44:43.880 --> 44:45.940
I'm gonna get a whole
carload of booze in

44:45.950 --> 44:47.310
in just a few minutes.

44:47.310 --> 44:49.350
I got California Coolers,

44:49.350 --> 44:50.780
Texas white lightning,

44:50.780 --> 44:53.750
Oklahoma Sooners
back there.

44:53.750 --> 44:55.090
( stuttering )
MAN: See ya later.

44:55.090 --> 44:56.990
We got chili,
we got Buffalo wings,

44:56.990 --> 44:58.520
you can shoot pool.

44:58.530 --> 45:03.090
There are all kinds
of things to do here...

45:07.870 --> 45:11.270
Why are you smiling
like a damn Cheshire cat?

45:11.270 --> 45:13.470
C.D., I said I'm sorry.
What else can I do?

45:13.470 --> 45:15.610
Breaks my heart for them
to go over to Flannery's.

45:15.610 --> 45:17.540
Oh, they'll be back.

45:17.540 --> 45:20.510
Good news.
Buddy's out of the hospital.

45:20.510 --> 45:22.550
And with Callie Spangler
turning state's evidence,

45:22.550 --> 45:25.220
Slattery and his gang
will never see light of day.

45:25.220 --> 45:26.780
This calls
for a celebration.

45:26.790 --> 45:31.260
With what? This place is as
quiet as a buggy-whip factory.

45:31.260 --> 45:32.960
Here we go again, C.D.

45:32.960 --> 45:34.190
Jimmy,

45:34.190 --> 45:35.490
I lost
a load of booze

45:35.500 --> 45:38.600
in the line of service.

45:38.600 --> 45:40.200
I should be compensated.

45:40.200 --> 45:42.370
Well, the good news is
is that the D.A. and the mayor

45:42.370 --> 45:43.430
happen to agree with you.

45:43.440 --> 45:45.470
Good.
Yes.

45:45.470 --> 45:47.770
And they are going
to present you with--

45:47.770 --> 45:49.040
Are you ready for this?

45:49.040 --> 45:50.710
--an official
commendation

45:50.710 --> 45:52.640
and a certificate
of gratitude

45:52.650 --> 45:55.510
personally signed
by the mayor to C.D. Parker

45:55.510 --> 45:58.720
for his selfless service
and devotion to the community.

45:58.720 --> 46:00.080
Oh.
TRIVETTE: Hear! Hear!

46:00.090 --> 46:01.090
Hear! Hear!

46:01.090 --> 46:02.390
Are they gonna
mail me a check?

46:02.390 --> 46:04.290
C.D., it'll look great
above the bar.

46:04.290 --> 46:05.760
Nothing looks great
above the bar

46:05.760 --> 46:06.820
unless you've got booze

46:06.830 --> 46:08.160
beneath the bar!

46:08.160 --> 46:09.660
Where in the hell
are y'all going?

46:09.660 --> 46:11.090
TRIVETTE:
Flannery's.

46:11.100 --> 46:12.560
For what?
( Trivette chuckling )

46:12.570 --> 46:14.930
For a drink.
To celebrate.

46:15.970 --> 46:18.500
Deserters.
That's what they are.

46:18.500 --> 46:21.170
Deserters.

46:21.170 --> 46:22.840
( sighs )

46:30.550 --> 46:32.920
