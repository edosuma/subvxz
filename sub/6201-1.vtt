04:53.718 --> 04:56.955
Cut! Okay, that's a print.

04:57.013 --> 04:58.223
That was great, Billy.

04:58.640 --> 04:59.916
OK, Everybody...

05:06.273 --> 05:08.149
Eddie, get up there and
see what the hell's happening.

05:08.400 --> 05:09.401
Billy, are you alright?

05:09.859 --> 05:13.713
- That thing crashed exactly where you were.
- I know. I know.

05:14.239 --> 05:15.807
Watch it up there.

05:15.949 --> 05:16.908
It was an accident.

05:17.200 --> 05:18.751
OK, that's a wrap.

05:18.743 --> 05:20.787
Great fight, Billy. Really nice.

05:20.870 --> 05:23.022
Be sure you get tomorrow's call sheets.

05:25.375 --> 05:29.087
And please, don't get lost on the way to location.

05:29.212 --> 05:33.199
Time is money, gentlemen.
time is money, time is money.

05:37.762 --> 05:40.106
So you got here finally.

05:45.687 --> 05:47.155
We haven't heard from you.

05:47.856 --> 05:49.324
You know, I once knew a...

05:49.399 --> 05:51.200
super rock group in London.

05:51.318 --> 05:53.161
Called themselves The Flight Crew.

05:53.945 --> 05:56.539
Had brilliant potential. Good.

05:57.365 --> 06:00.293
Yeah, but they were, ah, very stubborn.

06:01.911 --> 06:04.964
Their lead guitarist lost a couple
of fingers one night.

06:06.708 --> 06:08.009
Just like that.

06:10.378 --> 06:12.504
Hands and feet have been known to disappear.

06:12.505 --> 06:13.464
Lights...

06:13.465 --> 06:15.934
they fall outta the sky.
All kinds of things happen.

06:16.051 --> 06:22.148
A man's gotta have all his parts to make it.

06:25.435 --> 06:27.111
Don't you agree with that, Billy?

06:28.063 --> 06:29.396
Get the hell outta here!

06:29.397 --> 06:31.658
Yeah, it's, ah...

06:33.068 --> 06:34.410
getting a little late.

06:36.655 --> 06:40.041
Well, I'm sitting right there by telephone,

06:40.742 --> 06:42.335
just waiting for your call.

06:42.577 --> 06:45.254
But patience is not one of our virtues.

06:54.756 --> 06:56.965
Don't be a slow learner, Billy.

07:03.431 --> 07:05.566
Oh, you shouldn't have done that.

07:06.059 --> 07:08.569
No, that was a very big mistake.

07:12.148 --> 07:14.692
<i># Will this be the song #</i>

07:14.693 --> 07:20.039
<i># I'll be singing tomorrow? #</i>

07:21.032 --> 07:23.867
<i># Will the piper #</i>

07:23.868 --> 07:29.215
<i># continue playing? #</i>

07:29.624 --> 07:33.877

07:33.878 --> 07:38.891
<i># be your favorite #</i>

07:39.217 --> 07:46.098
<i># and stay in your heart? #</i>

07:46.099 --> 07:49.977
<i># Forever? #</i>

07:49.978 --> 07:57.276
<i># Let's enjoy this night #</i>

07:57.277 --> 08:05.752
<i># Will this be the song #</i>

08:05.952 --> 08:20.058
<i># I'll be singing tomorrow? #</i>

08:20.216 --> 08:21.851
I'm here to take you to dinner.

08:21.926 --> 08:24.187
Hey Billy, spaghetti tonight?

08:24.679 --> 08:26.722
We've still got one to go, Ann.

08:26.723 --> 08:27.806
Thanks a lot, Charlie.

08:27.807 --> 08:29.484
You're messing around with my love life.

08:47.577 --> 08:48.911
Is the boss upstairs?

08:48.912 --> 08:50.338
Yeah.

08:57.629 --> 08:59.296
You're looking a little pale.

08:59.297 --> 09:01.632
What you need is a nourishing meal

09:01.633 --> 09:03.935
Eat something nutritious

09:23.571 --> 09:27.708
You, you...you beautiful bastard.

09:29.744 --> 09:31.587
I will get you some more.

09:33.081 --> 09:34.382
Dr. Land?

09:40.964 --> 09:42.339
Doctor, Steiner's here.

09:42.340 --> 09:43.683
We're all next door.

09:44.634 --> 09:45.050
What?

09:45.051 --> 09:46.051
Steiner's here.

09:46.052 --> 09:48.563
Oh! We'll get right to it.

09:52.392 --> 09:53.860
Good afternoon.

09:56.521 --> 09:57.822
Good afternoon, Doctor.

09:58.648 --> 09:59.940
How was your trip to New York?

09:59.941 --> 10:01.024
It was unenventful.

10:01.025 --> 10:03.244
The heat was terrible.

10:03.528 --> 10:06.622
Not much better here humid.

10:06.656 --> 10:09.000
Ah, so much for the weather report.

10:10.076 --> 10:13.161
I'm not the only one who just arrived.

10:13.162 --> 10:15.581
How was Berlin, Stick?

10:15.582 --> 10:17.550
It went pretty much as you figured.

10:18.459 --> 10:21.470
Now, that, he's a big star,

10:22.380 --> 10:24.015
I couldn't reason with him.

10:24.841 --> 10:28.677
He said he was pulling out. Then he threatened me.

10:28.678 --> 10:32.231
Oh, my, my, my...

10:32.765 --> 10:35.109
The rest of it was in the papers.

10:36.394 --> 10:39.363
That's when he committed suicide, huh?

10:40.231 --> 10:43.367
He just got up and jumped out the window.

10:43.860 --> 10:45.453
Oh, my...

10:45.987 --> 10:50.115
The S and S Records with Globe merger is done

10:50.116 --> 10:54.462
Work's started on the new plant in Buenos Aires

10:54.829 --> 10:57.664
But more important is the coming

10:57.665 --> 11:00.676
championship fight in Macau.

11:00.793 --> 11:02.753
I know we're getting world wide press.

11:02.754 --> 11:04.096
That and plenty more.

11:04.839 --> 11:06.590
All the posters

11:06.591 --> 11:07.716
have been approved.

11:07.717 --> 11:09.227
And the ad campaign

11:10.678 --> 11:12.271
is the best we've ever had.

11:12.430 --> 11:14.065
Looks good. Looks great.

11:15.099 --> 11:17.693
Besides the ad and our TV rights

11:18.603 --> 11:22.073
it's generating the
international betting we'd hoped for.

11:22.315 --> 11:25.117
We're looking at a turnover
of thirty million dollars.

11:25.360 --> 11:27.235
That was the computer's readout as of today.

11:27.236 --> 11:27.736
Yes.

11:27.737 --> 11:30.873
Well, fight's only three weeks off.

11:31.407 --> 11:35.336
I assume your training is going well,
Carl you look fit.

11:35.411 --> 11:36.244
I'll be ready.

11:36.245 --> 11:38.756
We've got a little problem in Detroit

11:39.374 --> 11:41.926
A couple of reluctant ballplayers.

11:42.543 --> 11:45.253
Hakim, can you get to Detroit

11:45.254 --> 11:47.756
handle that and be back in time for the fight?

11:47.757 --> 11:49.433
Consider it done.

11:49.968 --> 11:53.271
Also, I'm afraid we're gonna have to do
something about Billy Lo.

11:53.805 --> 11:55.055
I was wondering about that.

11:55.056 --> 11:57.566
I was gonna ask how that was going.

11:58.351 --> 12:00.352
Well, he refuses to sign our management contract,

12:00.353 --> 12:01.946
but that's not what bothers me.

12:02.355 --> 12:04.365
He's starting to shoot off his mouth.

12:04.399 --> 12:05.607
He's holding out.

12:05.608 --> 12:06.984
We've given him so many chances.

12:06.985 --> 12:09.653
An amazing amount of resistance.

12:09.654 --> 12:13.907
And then, then there's that girlfriend,
Ann Morris.

12:13.908 --> 12:15.283
I went to talk to her today.

12:15.284 --> 12:18.462
Her last album's on the charts and
it's doing great in Australia and France.

12:18.663 --> 12:22.791
She says she wants to talk to Billy
about her contract. before she signs.

12:22.792 --> 12:27.722
Doc, I think we should squeeze a little.

12:28.881 --> 12:34.353
Yeah, yes. squeeze a little. as you say.

12:36.139 --> 12:37.222
Billy?

12:37.223 --> 12:38.056
Yeah?

12:38.057 --> 12:41.152
I had another visit today from
one of the mobsters.

12:41.894 --> 12:43.362
Did he threaten you?

12:43.521 --> 12:46.407
Well, not exactly. I mean, not in so many words.

12:46.691 --> 12:48.951
But I knew I was being threatened.

12:50.278 --> 12:52.738
Billy, do you think it's worth holding out?

12:52.739 --> 12:55.958
I've heard some pretty ugly things
about those guys.

12:57.160 --> 12:58.878
Ugly stories!

13:21.476 --> 13:26.072
If we're stopped, don't do anything that
will give them an excuse to hurt you.

13:38.242 --> 13:40.711
Ann, I love you and I don't want you hurt.

13:40.745 --> 13:42.421
Trust me to handle this.

13:46.084 --> 13:48.135
I would like Miss Morris to leave.

13:48.878 --> 13:50.930
Oh, I'm afraid we can't do that, Billy.

13:51.506 --> 13:53.090
We're all in this together.

13:53.091 --> 13:55.351
Now, would you mind stepping out of the car?

13:55.551 --> 13:59.355
No matter what happens don't get out of the car.

14:06.312 --> 14:08.823
You're got until tomorrow morning to call us.

14:10.108 --> 14:12.201
It's the last time we're gonna ask, Billy.

14:13.444 --> 14:14.662
Billy!

14:26.415 --> 14:27.466
No!

14:45.017 --> 14:46.318
Billy!

15:02.952 --> 15:04.670
Please! Stop it!

15:12.295 --> 15:13.762
Please, don't!

15:18.634 --> 15:20.102
Billy!

15:28.561 --> 15:30.237
Billy!

15:34.775 --> 15:36.619
He hasn't got much time.

15:38.279 --> 15:39.955
You tell him that.

15:40.698 --> 15:42.583
We wanna hear from him in the morning.

16:05.681 --> 16:08.817
Billy...I've always been straight with you.

16:09.936 --> 16:11.529
You don't have too many choices.

16:11.646 --> 16:13.188
You and Ann are nothing to them.

16:13.189 --> 16:14.949
You're just another piece of property.

16:15.107 --> 16:19.370
Just one of a few thousand public
personalities that they own...

16:19.904 --> 16:21.914
all of, or a piece of.

16:23.241 --> 16:26.085
It seems like a good thing...at the moment.

16:26.202 --> 16:28.128
They take care of everything, your...

16:28.246 --> 16:31.131
your booking, your salary, your taxes.

16:31.165 --> 16:34.009
If you need five thousand in your pocket,
you've got it.

16:34.543 --> 16:39.598
It's later that you start to realize
what it's costing you.

16:40.383 --> 16:43.060
I don't have to remind you about Charlie Wang.

16:43.427 --> 16:45.053
We know the pressure they put on him...

16:45.054 --> 16:47.898
and we know they called him in for a talk.

16:50.768 --> 16:52.987
The next day he was fished out of the harbor.

16:54.772 --> 16:57.074
But going along with them isn't much better.

17:35.521 --> 17:36.896
You've come up fast, Billy.

17:36.897 --> 17:39.533
Your pictures are grossing big all over the world.

17:39.942 --> 17:41.285
You're an international...

17:41.485 --> 17:44.371
celebrity...and they smell that money!

17:45.323 --> 17:46.498
Thank you.

17:47.742 --> 17:49.835
You can sign with them and live very well...

17:51.537 --> 17:53.413
or you can defy them and go to the police,

17:53.414 --> 17:56.759
which means you won't live so well...if at all.

17:58.085 --> 18:00.304
Is it your advice to let them own us?

18:01.672 --> 18:06.268
I just don't want to write your obituary.

18:07.053 --> 18:08.470
I like you too much.

18:08.471 --> 18:11.181
She says she wants to talk to Billy
about her contract.

18:11.182 --> 18:14.318
I've got a midnight deadline in the States.

18:17.188 --> 18:18.447
I can't allow it.

18:18.856 --> 18:21.909
It is better to die a broken piece of jade

18:22.234 --> 18:24.453
than to live a life of clay.

18:25.571 --> 18:26.789
Quit!

18:27.114 --> 18:28.281
You've got enough money.

18:28.282 --> 18:29.199
Tell them to go to hell.

18:29.200 --> 18:30.834
I can leave this all behind.

18:30.951 --> 18:33.003
I don't need this if you don't need it.

18:39.460 --> 18:41.261
There's got to be another answer.

18:42.671 --> 18:44.098
I've got to find one.

18:54.392 --> 18:55.850
The Chinese Opera is in town.

18:55.851 --> 18:57.319
Maybe see your uncle.

18:57.937 --> 18:59.312
Yeah, he just got back.

18:59.313 --> 19:01.272
I'll go to the theater tomorrow.

19:01.273 --> 19:02.449
Good idea.

19:04.068 --> 19:06.036
They're leaving the restaurant.

19:06.070 --> 19:06.912
What should we do ?

19:06.987 --> 19:08.163
Don't lose them!

19:16.080 --> 19:18.706
Andre, from now on I want you to coordinate

19:18.707 --> 19:20.667
with the ad agency in New York.

19:20.668 --> 19:22.720
Also, what are the odds where you are now?

19:23.546 --> 19:27.382
Well, then keep up the hype
about Carl's rumored sprained ligament.

19:27.383 --> 19:35.014
Don't give the impression that
the fight's gonna be cancelled...

19:35.015 --> 19:38.768
Ciao. The odds are a little too heavy on

19:38.769 --> 19:41.238
Carl, especially in London.

19:41.981 --> 19:44.408
Yes. It's a good idea to even that up a bit.

19:45.818 --> 19:46.276
Oh, by the way,

19:46.277 --> 19:49.446
What about Billy Lo? What...

19:49.447 --> 19:52.416
He was told to call earlier today.

19:53.117 --> 19:54.742
He has our number to call?

19:54.743 --> 19:57.004
Oh? Do we know where he is at this moment?

19:57.329 --> 19:59.372
Well, we always know where he is.

19:59.373 --> 20:02.333
Well, then...a final warning...

20:02.334 --> 20:04.178
eh,Carl?

20:05.754 --> 20:07.848
Yes, Pasquel, you go with him.

20:11.010 --> 20:14.062
Pasquel loves to fight.

20:53.302 --> 20:55.020
Let me use your brush. Thanks.

20:58.390 --> 20:59.432
Billy! Good to see you.

20:59.433 --> 21:00.934
Hi, John. Glad you're back.

21:00.935 --> 21:02.319
Your uncle's in his room.

21:11.820 --> 21:15.499
Billy! Come in, Billy, come in! Hey! Hey!

21:16.283 --> 21:17.075
You go ahead.

21:17.076 --> 21:18.326
Ahh, it's good to see you, boy

21:18.327 --> 21:19.962
Sit down. sit down.

21:23.707 --> 21:25.166
We did not see you much...

21:25.167 --> 21:27.719
since you got to be a big man.

21:28.212 --> 21:29.212
Oh, yes, I know.

21:29.213 --> 21:31.098
I've been running for months.

21:31.674 --> 21:33.350
Yeah. Very busy, huh?

21:35.302 --> 21:38.221
I heard that the syndicate is after you.

21:38.222 --> 21:40.014
You must be a big man.

21:40.015 --> 21:41.358
How did you know that?

21:42.226 --> 21:43.777
It's a small business.

21:44.353 --> 21:47.605
I can't join them and I can't be forced to join.

21:47.606 --> 21:51.201
You have just described a problem as old as Man.

21:51.443 --> 21:52.828
You're not unique.

21:54.029 --> 21:58.250
There is a solution
I don't think you've considered.

21:59.410 --> 22:01.578
When you get to the top, you'll understand

22:01.579 --> 22:03.171
how far it is to fall.

22:04.081 --> 22:06.675
But the less you think of yourself

22:07.835 --> 22:11.889
the easier you can be pushed off.

22:13.882 --> 22:15.851
What do you think?

22:16.760 --> 22:19.187
I believe I deserve to be where I am.

22:19.513 --> 22:21.064
I've worked hard for it.

22:21.765 --> 22:23.558
Then don't let them push you.

22:23.559 --> 22:25.527
They will never let you rest.

22:25.644 --> 22:26.778
You push!

22:28.022 --> 22:29.823
You mean kill?

22:31.525 --> 22:34.036
Integrity can be a luxury.

22:34.445 --> 22:36.580
What is the price of your integrity?

22:36.614 --> 22:38.415
What are you willing to pay?

22:38.782 --> 22:40.408
There is another person as well.

22:40.409 --> 22:41.585
A girl.

22:41.994 --> 22:43.754
If I fight, she may be hurt.

22:44.246 --> 22:45.505
Send her away.

22:47.166 --> 22:48.383
Do you need help?

22:48.542 --> 22:50.344
I know some men who can help you.

22:51.003 --> 22:52.137
No.

22:53.005 --> 22:55.641
You're not allowed back here! Get out! Get out!

23:47.643 --> 23:49.194
Another message, Billy.

23:53.357 --> 23:56.576
The Chinese syndicate wants to make sure
they're riding the winner.

23:57.695 --> 24:00.414
So they're willing to buy a little insurance.

24:00.614 --> 24:05.493
$1.5 million in cash
will be arriving in Macau soon

24:05.494 --> 24:06.920
just before the fight.

24:07.746 --> 24:10.007
They're gonna drop it right on your doorstep.

24:11.041 --> 24:12.834
Huh! Clean money?

24:12.835 --> 24:13.802
Oh, yeah.

24:14.211 --> 24:16.888
Yeah, very crisp and very clean.

24:17.798 --> 24:19.424
Cash started out in Nassau.

24:19.425 --> 24:22.301
It's going through Tommy's bank in Mexico
City right now.

24:22.302 --> 24:23.928
We're watching its progress.

24:23.929 --> 24:25.188
Fine. Fine.

24:26.640 --> 24:28.191
Ah...Carl?

24:28.726 --> 24:29.308
Yeah, sir?

24:29.309 --> 24:30.777
What about Billy Lo?

24:31.061 --> 24:32.145
What's happened there?

24:32.146 --> 24:33.104
Nothing.

24:33.105 --> 24:34.105
Not a word.

24:34.106 --> 24:35.574
He's not gonna call!

24:37.317 --> 24:39.536
Rebellion is contagious, Doc.

24:40.487 --> 24:41.955
Let's close the book.

24:43.407 --> 24:50.338
What a waste. casting aside his life like that.

24:51.248 --> 24:52.674
What a pity.

24:55.586 --> 24:56.586
Hello.

24:56.587 --> 24:57.879
Hello, Ann. It's me.

24:57.880 --> 24:59.088
Oh, Billy, where've you been?

24:59.089 --> 25:01.174
I've been trying to reach you all day!

25:01.175 --> 25:02.517
I've been worried about you!

25:02.593 --> 25:04.478
I've been worried about you, too, darling.

25:04.511 --> 25:05.845
Ann, listen carefully.

25:05.846 --> 25:08.347
I want you to meet me on the six o'clock ferry.

25:08.348 --> 25:10.016
You'll find me in the passenger section.

25:10.017 --> 25:11.151
Do you understand?

25:11.477 --> 25:12.527
Okay.

25:12.728 --> 25:13.936
Billy, are you all right?

25:13.937 --> 25:14.854
Yes.

25:14.855 --> 25:17.574
To tell the truth, I feel much better now.

26:24.049 --> 26:25.225
Billy!

26:30.681 --> 26:31.973
Billy, you've been hurt!

26:31.974 --> 26:32.932
It doesn't matter.

26:32.933 --> 26:37.112
Ann...I want you to go back
to the States for awhile.

26:38.063 --> 26:39.573
Leave you here?

26:39.648 --> 26:42.159
I have to work this out myself.

26:42.401 --> 26:44.068
It would only be for awhile.

26:44.069 --> 26:45.495
A couple of months.

26:46.780 --> 26:48.456
No way, Billy!

26:48.782 --> 26:50.333
I can't do that.

26:50.492 --> 26:52.669
Look...you can't help me.

26:52.703 --> 26:54.880
But if you stay, you could get hurt.

26:55.330 --> 26:57.957
Maybe you should change your name
and disappear for awhile.

26:57.958 --> 26:59.625
Only one scene left in this film.

26:59.626 --> 27:01.469
I'll be dropping out of sight myself.

27:05.090 --> 27:07.058
Billy, I can't leave you!

27:07.801 --> 27:09.051
What're you up to?

27:09.052 --> 27:10.312
Not a thing.

27:11.722 --> 27:13.190
We have to separate!

27:17.352 --> 27:20.947
Ann, I'd like to live with you a long time

27:21.899 --> 27:23.241
you know?

27:23.942 --> 27:25.410
Grow old together.

27:26.862 --> 27:28.195
It was very strange, Jim.

27:28.196 --> 27:29.748
Not like him. Very secretive.

27:30.115 --> 27:33.868
It sounds like he's made the decision to run
which would be smart.

27:33.869 --> 27:35.286
No, I don't think he's running at all.

27:35.287 --> 27:36.746
I think it's just the opposite.

27:36.747 --> 27:38.623
There was a determination about him.

27:38.624 --> 27:40.008
Like he was going to fight.

27:40.292 --> 27:43.127
Jim, I know he has a call
at the studio this afternoon.

27:43.128 --> 27:44.804
Would you mind meeting me there?

27:44.838 --> 27:46.297
I'm really worried about him.

27:46.298 --> 27:47.849
Of course. I'll be right over.

27:48.133 --> 27:48.841
Stage Four.

27:48.842 --> 27:50.227
Yeah, gotcha.

27:51.803 --> 27:52.595
David?

27:52.596 --> 27:54.981
Yeah. Very busy, huh? Keep it together!

27:58.310 --> 27:59.236
Cut!

27:59.478 --> 28:00.528
Print it!

28:02.189 --> 28:03.648
Okay, turn around, guys.

28:03.649 --> 28:05.191
Let's set up for Billy's run.

28:05.192 --> 28:06.233
Okay, move it along.

28:06.234 --> 28:07.944
Get ready for the reverse angle.

28:07.945 --> 28:09.246
Let's go, fellas.

28:13.533 --> 28:15.126
Gentlemen, these are blanks.

28:16.036 --> 28:17.587
Only aim upward.

28:18.205 --> 28:21.424
There's a wad of paper that comes out
and can injure someone.

28:38.475 --> 28:39.642
We're ready for you, Billy

28:39.643 --> 28:40.777
Okay.

28:52.948 --> 28:55.041
I want you to race the hell out of that building

28:55.242 --> 28:58.044
I'll cue the guns and then you take the fall

28:58.412 --> 28:59.421
OK.

28:59.788 --> 29:01.548
OK, let's walk though it again.

29:05.377 --> 29:06.002
Billy!

29:06.003 --> 29:07.345
Over here!

29:09.381 --> 29:10.765
What are you doing here?

29:10.799 --> 29:12.466
Take her to the airport, Jim.

29:12.467 --> 29:15.687
Billy, something doesn't feel right.

29:16.179 --> 29:17.314
Do you need help?

29:17.347 --> 29:19.140
I'm going to break it wide open!

29:19.141 --> 29:20.683
The police gotta get onto it.

29:20.684 --> 29:23.028
And when it explodes, I don't want Ann here!

29:23.603 --> 29:24.904
Get her on a plane!

29:27.107 --> 29:27.773
Billy...

29:27.774 --> 29:29.034
Please, Jim!

29:31.987 --> 29:33.079
Here we go!

29:33.613 --> 29:34.914
Everybody settle down.

29:35.657 --> 29:36.833
Ready.

29:39.077 --> 29:40.545
OK, ready to roll.

29:40.787 --> 29:43.256
OK this is a take!

29:43.790 --> 29:45.133
Quiet, please!

29:50.380 --> 29:52.057
OK, roll sound!

29:52.132 --> 29:53.183
Speed.

29:53.633 --> 29:55.226
Lock in.

29:56.720 --> 29:58.021
Action!

30:22.537 --> 30:23.755
Cut!

30:24.790 --> 30:26.383
Hey, Billy, what's the matter!

30:27.542 --> 30:29.010
Hey, what's happened here?

30:29.336 --> 30:30.512
What happened?

30:33.882 --> 30:34.965
What's wrong?

30:34.966 --> 30:36.935
My God...he's hurt!

30:36.968 --> 30:37.968
Hey, get some help, will?

30:37.969 --> 30:39.804
Somebody call the doctor! Get an ambulance

30:39.805 --> 30:41.773
Don't just stand there!

30:49.731 --> 30:52.700
The bullet fragmented as it passed through
at an upward angle...

30:52.818 --> 30:55.453
literally smashing the bone structure of the face.

30:55.695 --> 30:59.791
What are his chances of regaining
a normal appearance?

31:00.450 --> 31:05.130
There's extensive structural damage
and scar tissue

31:05.747 --> 31:07.540
He'll be permanently altered.

31:07.541 --> 31:09.342
But presentable in any case.

31:12.420 --> 31:13.847
Hm. Thank you, Doctor.

31:27.686 --> 31:29.779
Hi ya, Billy.

31:30.313 --> 31:31.322
Are you awake?

31:31.690 --> 31:32.782
Yes.

31:33.066 --> 31:34.608
I've been talking with your surgeon.

31:34.609 --> 31:37.954
The surgery will be tomorrow.

31:38.780 --> 31:40.322
This is a very private hospital.

31:40.323 --> 31:42.542
No one will know.

31:42.784 --> 31:43.835
Good.

31:44.119 --> 31:46.129
Then you still want to go through with this?

31:46.746 --> 31:47.881
Yes.

31:48.540 --> 31:50.842
The only reason I've considered this,

31:51.668 --> 31:53.178
is the simple argument that

31:53.420 --> 31:57.089
if you walk out on the streets again

31:57.090 --> 31:59.008
there'll be another attempt on your life.

31:59.009 --> 32:00.477
Then you agree?

32:00.969 --> 32:05.231
We'll have to get you fake papers

32:05.307 --> 32:08.475
Death certificate and somebody will issue word

32:08.476 --> 32:12.113
that you took a turn for the worse.

32:12.230 --> 32:14.315
Then there's the question of a change of identity.

32:14.316 --> 32:17.327
I've already taken care of that.

32:19.821 --> 32:21.164
I should tell Ann.

32:22.449 --> 32:27.045
No! No one else must know.

32:27.370 --> 32:30.256
If she knows...she could be in danger.

32:30.749 --> 32:31.883
A public funeral?

32:31.958 --> 32:33.343
Open casket?

32:33.710 --> 32:35.637
After all, he is a celebrity.

32:35.921 --> 32:37.180
Don't worry, John.

32:37.881 --> 32:40.183
It'll be a very believable funeral.

34:03.925 --> 34:05.935
They have some interesting people here.

34:10.556 --> 34:11.815
Could be a story.

34:26.114 --> 34:27.248
Miss Morris.

34:28.949 --> 34:30.743
You're dead! Come on, Ann.

34:30.744 --> 34:32.629
You hear me? You're dead!

34:32.829 --> 34:34.130
Cool it!

34:35.373 --> 34:36.549
Excuse us.

34:37.792 --> 34:38.967
Thank you.

34:39.293 --> 34:40.553
Oops. Easy.

34:41.920 --> 34:43.348
Thank you.

34:46.134 --> 34:47.226
You know, Ann...

34:49.054 --> 34:51.063
they could have you killed for ten bucks

34:51.181 --> 34:53.608
Yes, I understand it's cheap!

34:53.766 --> 34:55.318
I'm glad you understand.

34:55.935 --> 34:59.897
Ann I'm glad you're pulling yourself together

34:59.898 --> 35:01.866
No, I'm not gonna cry anymore!

35:02.484 --> 35:06.079
God knows the police would like to nail them

35:07.947 --> 35:08.864
But...

35:08.865 --> 35:10.240
there's no way to prove it.

35:10.241 --> 35:13.211
Don't you understand anything?

35:13.703 --> 35:16.047
Everybody was looking

35:16.373 --> 35:19.759
but no one saw anything.

35:39.479 --> 35:43.273
The Chinese guys and the money have arrived.

35:43.274 --> 35:44.233
Fine. Fine.

35:44.234 --> 35:45.943
Are you sure it's a good idea,

35:45.944 --> 35:49.205
us stopping by the rehab center
to see the Morris girl?

35:49.906 --> 35:52.125
She's a very valuable piece of merchandise.

35:52.659 --> 35:54.919
And if we can bring her into the family

35:54.953 --> 35:58.631
it would show the others
how complete our power is.

36:18.059 --> 36:19.736
Go ahead, I'll see you later.

36:20.520 --> 36:21.186
Hello. Mister...

36:21.187 --> 36:22.405
Hello, Doctor.

36:22.689 --> 36:23.856
How's Ann?

36:23.857 --> 36:25.867
We are very pleased with her recovery.

36:25.900 --> 36:30.079
It's been a long haul.

36:30.488 --> 36:31.748
Three weeks?

36:32.866 --> 36:35.418
For a trauma severe enough to bring
on physical paralysis...

36:35.618 --> 36:37.828
A three-week recovery is pretty good

36:37.829 --> 36:40.423
Well, may I go down and see her?

36:40.623 --> 36:41.707
Absolutely.

36:41.708 --> 36:43.459
I'll come get you when your time's up.

36:43.460 --> 36:45.219
She's ready to see a familiar face.

36:46.296 --> 36:48.431
You must understand, she is still depressed.

36:58.475 --> 36:59.650
Is it time to go in?

37:00.101 --> 37:00.893
Hi, Annie.

37:00.894 --> 37:02.320
Jim!

37:04.147 --> 37:07.316
Oh, I brought you a little present.

37:07.317 --> 37:08.567
Oh, it's beautiful! Mmm!

37:08.568 --> 37:10.411
I hear nothing but good things about you.

37:10.695 --> 37:11.695
No lies?

37:11.696 --> 37:12.830
No lies.

37:13.281 --> 37:14.916
Would a newspaper man lie?

37:15.575 --> 37:17.210
Now I'm getting worried.

37:18.995 --> 37:20.871
You know, Jim, actually I'm feeling a lot better.

37:20.872 --> 37:22.006
Good.

37:22.207 --> 37:24.509
At least I'm able to deal with people now

37:29.756 --> 37:33.518
You know...maybe you should get outta here.

37:33.927 --> 37:36.512
Go back to the States when you're feeling better.

37:36.513 --> 37:38.648
I've been thinking about that, too.

37:39.516 --> 37:41.067
But I don't want to yet.

37:44.020 --> 37:45.488
Not just yet.

37:45.772 --> 37:47.406
Yes, but more important than that...

37:48.066 --> 37:49.775
I think we ought to try to see for ourselves

37:49.776 --> 37:51.577
what's going on in her head.

37:51.694 --> 37:53.412
What kind of a threat she could be to us.

37:54.113 --> 37:56.782
I don't wanna leave that to Carl
or to anybody else.

37:56.783 --> 37:58.167
What have we here?

37:58.576 --> 37:59.836
Yeah...

38:01.329 --> 38:03.464
that's the newspaperman Jim Marshall.

38:04.040 --> 38:05.832
And I've got a hunch that one of these days

38:05.833 --> 38:08.710
we're gonna have to cram
his typewriter up his ass!

38:08.711 --> 38:10.012
Oh?

38:15.552 --> 38:16.769
The blonde.

38:34.862 --> 38:36.539
Good afternoon, Miss Morris.

38:37.865 --> 38:39.292
We haven't officially met...

38:39.450 --> 38:40.701
but my name is Steiner.

38:40.702 --> 38:41.577
This is Doctor Land.

38:41.578 --> 38:43.370
How do you do, Miss Morries?

38:43.371 --> 38:46.173
We were informed of your improvement.

38:46.624 --> 38:49.459
You are so beautiful! Beautiful!

38:49.460 --> 38:50.636
What do you want?

38:51.087 --> 38:54.849
Well, we were just passing by wondered
if we could do anything for you.

38:55.216 --> 38:56.967
Is there something you might need?

38:56.968 --> 38:58.635
There's nothing I need! OK?

38:58.636 --> 39:00.846
Your album is doing very well on the charts.

39:00.847 --> 39:02.180
It's gonna make lots of money.

39:02.181 --> 39:04.224
We know, Miss Morris, what has happened.

39:04.225 --> 39:06.018
The terrible strain

39:06.019 --> 39:07.686
you have been under.

39:07.687 --> 39:09.479
Uh, we hoped, that possibly,

39:09.480 --> 39:11.231
we can assist you in some way.

39:11.232 --> 39:14.443
You know, maybe get your career moving again.

39:14.444 --> 39:16.111
- Get out!
- Look, nothing's go...

39:16.112 --> 39:17.538
Get out!

39:18.239 --> 39:21.491
It's Doc Land's intention to try to help you, Ann.

39:21.492 --> 39:22.409
He could be very...

39:22.410 --> 39:24.003
You murderers!

39:24.078 --> 39:26.121
Get out!

39:26.122 --> 39:27.623
Ai...

39:27.624 --> 39:29.759
Get out! Just get outta here!

39:31.836 --> 39:33.971
Rude bitch!

39:35.214 --> 39:37.516
Well, one rebel begets another

39:37.717 --> 39:39.143
It's the Billy Lo syndrome.

39:39.552 --> 39:41.729
A virulent disease!

39:42.138 --> 39:43.898
Often terminal

39:44.932 --> 39:46.767
Stick, she seemed to know you.

39:46.768 --> 39:48.986
Your face did something for her.

39:49.354 --> 39:50.780
Never met her.

39:51.105 --> 39:52.481
Well, we have to go to Macau.

39:52.482 --> 39:54.659
Oh, bitch!

39:57.737 --> 40:00.706
We'll take care of her later

40:11.542 --> 40:12.969
What're you up to, Billy?

40:13.169 --> 40:15.054
I'm giving myself a new face.

40:16.214 --> 40:19.058
Before...and after.

40:19.717 --> 40:20.935
Much better.

40:22.095 --> 40:23.387
I've already told you, Billy.

40:23.388 --> 40:25.272
You're going to have a normal appearance again.

40:26.140 --> 40:26.890
You'll see.

40:26.891 --> 40:29.068
Wait till tomorrow when those bandages come off.

40:30.436 --> 40:31.988
Well, excuse me.

40:36.651 --> 40:38.077
The new Billy Lo.

41:33.958 --> 41:35.041
Mister?

41:35.042 --> 41:37.386
Can I hire you to follow that hydrofoil?

41:37.754 --> 41:40.723
I won't be able to follow them once they
get out of the harbor.

41:41.257 --> 41:43.684
Those hydrofoils do forty, easy!

41:44.218 --> 41:45.603
Where do you think they're going?

41:45.636 --> 41:49.023
I've seen their boat in Macau...once or twice

41:49.098 --> 41:50.566
Maybe they're heading there.

41:50.933 --> 41:52.726
Maybe we could get a head start on them.

41:52.727 --> 41:55.196
Well, it's only an hour's ride, in any case.

42:31.933 --> 42:33.275
Macau!

42:41.526 --> 42:42.108
Yeah?

42:42.109 --> 42:43.911
I know who killed Billy.

42:44.028 --> 42:44.778
Ann?

42:44.779 --> 42:46.530
Yes. Jim, I know who killed him!

42:46.531 --> 42:47.998
I'm not sure I heard you right.

42:48.407 --> 42:49.625
What did you say?

42:49.909 --> 42:51.377
They came to the hospital.

42:51.452 --> 42:53.161
One of them was at the shooting.

42:53.162 --> 42:57.883
Why don't you come over
and we'll go to the police?

42:59.043 --> 43:01.670
Where are you? Did you...leave the hospital?

43:01.671 --> 43:02.796
Never mind.

43:02.797 --> 43:04.265
The police aren't the answer!

43:21.274 --> 43:22.283
Hey, mister.

43:22.316 --> 43:24.535
Is that the guy you been waitin' for?

43:24.819 --> 43:25.995
That's him.

43:37.456 --> 43:39.466
I'll make it worth your while to wait for me.

43:40.167 --> 43:42.252
You're not gonna rob a casino, are ya?

43:42.253 --> 43:44.096
I don't want to be on a runaway boat.

43:44.171 --> 43:45.306
No, no.

43:45.381 --> 43:47.099
Will you be here no matter how late?

43:47.550 --> 43:49.310
I got nothing better on.

45:18.766 --> 45:20.934
Parade! Parade! Damn it to hell!

45:20.935 --> 45:22.602
Can't we get outta here somehow?

45:22.603 --> 45:24.697
Back this thing up, for Chr...

45:24.814 --> 45:26.407
There's a taxi behind us.

45:26.607 --> 45:27.941
It should end soon

45:27.942 --> 45:30.703
and they will move to another street.

45:41.372 --> 45:42.414
Give them the horn

45:42.415 --> 45:43.540
Let's get outta here!

45:43.541 --> 45:44.717
Run them over!

46:36.093 --> 46:37.728
Chinese gold!

46:39.472 --> 46:40.638
They've been waiting for an hour.

46:40.639 --> 46:42.098
We were held up by a damn fool lion dance!

46:42.099 --> 46:44.693
Oh, boy! These characters!

46:55.613 --> 46:57.956
Ah! Well, Well, Well!

47:03.496 --> 47:04.704
How do you do, Doc?

47:04.705 --> 47:05.288
How are you?

47:05.289 --> 47:06.539
- Very nice seeing you.
- Hello. Thank you.

47:06.540 --> 47:07.633
- And how are you?
- Doc.

47:07.833 --> 47:09.093
Sit down.

47:09.585 --> 47:11.136
Well, maybe...

47:11.337 --> 47:14.014
maybe we don't need to even count it.

47:22.973 --> 47:24.233
Maybe we better.

47:38.072 --> 47:39.623
See you both ring side.

48:00.594 --> 48:01.603
Doc?

48:02.888 --> 48:04.231
Doc Land?

48:05.307 --> 48:06.316
Yes?

48:06.475 --> 48:07.901
The money's all here!

48:08.102 --> 48:09.227
Every dollar!

48:09.228 --> 48:11.196
I'd be surprised if it weren't.

48:34.628 --> 48:36.054
Where'd you come from?

48:36.172 --> 48:36.629
Who are you?

48:36.630 --> 48:37.714
How'd you get here?

48:37.715 --> 48:40.383
Po! Guards! Carl! Po!

48:40.384 --> 48:43.261
Po! Guards!

48:43.262 --> 48:44.179
Guards!

48:44.180 --> 48:46.356
Guards!

48:46.765 --> 48:47.941
Guards!

48:48.100 --> 48:49.109
Guards!

48:49.143 --> 48:50.402
Guards!

48:54.398 --> 48:55.491
Get him!

49:10.581 --> 49:12.966
Guards! Po! Carl! Carl!

49:24.511 --> 49:26.396
Stay away from me, you bastard!

50:06.553 --> 50:08.605
Carl! Carl! Come! Come!

50:15.145 --> 50:15.645
Get him!

50:15.646 --> 50:16.479
Kill him!

50:16.480 --> 50:17.614
Carl! Duck!

50:21.277 --> 50:22.578
Somebody take care of the Doctor!

50:23.570 --> 50:24.830
Carl! Let him go!

50:25.406 --> 50:26.656
Carl, you damn fool!

50:26.657 --> 50:27.874
The fight's tonight!

50:28.325 --> 50:31.044
Carl, come on back here! You hear me? Carl!

50:46.427 --> 50:47.760
You know, I don't understand it.

50:47.761 --> 50:50.179
If some other organization was trying to kill you

50:50.180 --> 50:53.400
They'd just pick you off with a rifle.

50:53.559 --> 50:55.527
I can't place him, but there was...

50:56.895 --> 50:58.822
something there I recognized.

50:58.939 --> 50:59.814
Stick is right!

50:59.815 --> 51:02.275
There was something different about that man.

51:02.276 --> 51:04.193
He not only wanted to kill!

51:04.194 --> 51:06.538
He wanted to punish me as well!

52:21.438 --> 52:23.689
Get in the corner.

52:23.690 --> 52:24.732
One!

52:24.733 --> 52:25.149
Get back!

52:25.150 --> 52:26.359
Get back, Millet!

52:26.360 --> 52:27.443
Get in your corner.

52:27.444 --> 52:28.328
Get in your corner.

52:28.404 --> 52:29.404
Two!

52:29.405 --> 52:31.164
Get back, Miller!

52:31.323 --> 52:33.875
Three! Four!

52:34.034 --> 52:35.502
Five!

52:36.620 --> 52:38.004
Six!

52:56.640 --> 52:59.067
They've been hurt badly
through the earlier rounds.

53:33.677 --> 53:35.395
Kill him, Carl!

53:42.269 --> 53:44.228
Break! Back up! Back up!

53:44.229 --> 53:46.189
Back! Get back! Get back!

53:46.190 --> 53:48.033
That's gonna cost you a round, Miller!

54:42.579 --> 54:43.713
Let it go.

54:43.747 --> 54:46.007
What must be done is being done.

54:50.420 --> 54:52.055
Billy?

55:10.315 --> 55:14.703
One, two, three...four.

56:32.397 --> 56:35.033
Break it up. Back, Miller. Back!

56:43.200 --> 56:45.618
Retained his world heavyweight crown
by knocking out

56:45.619 --> 56:48.546
Lo Chen in <i>2</i> minutes 8 seconds
in the seventh round

56:54.628 --> 56:58.297
The winner by a KO World heavyweight champion

56:58.298 --> 56:59.849
Carl Miller!

57:20.362 --> 57:23.999
Carl! Carl! You won! You won!

57:28.328 --> 57:30.287
Hey, Carl!

57:30.288 --> 57:33.374
Let me in here!
Carl, Carl, is there gonna be a rematch?

57:33.375 --> 57:35.501
Yeah, how about a rematch?
Are you gonna fight this guy again?

57:35.502 --> 57:38.087
Carl, did he hurt you in round four?
Carl, how soon are you...

57:38.088 --> 57:40.223
Let's find some champagne. Gonna have a rematch?

57:42.467 --> 57:45.228
Smile, Carl. Carl! Turn this way, Carl.
Will there be a rematch, Carl?

58:01.862 --> 58:04.247
Hey hey! Hey! Hey!

58:04.990 --> 58:06.115
Did he hurt you at any time?

58:06.116 --> 58:08.200
Have you got any complaints? Real good.

58:08.201 --> 58:11.046
Hey. I'm just going to get a shower.

58:11.121 --> 58:14.049
I want to look beautiful for the rest
of these photographs.

58:14.291 --> 58:16.625
There's plenty of champagne for everybody.

58:16.626 --> 58:18.261
We should have a good time

58:21.882 --> 58:22.631
Who are you?

58:22.632 --> 58:23.933
I'm June!

58:28.388 --> 58:29.981
This is my new girlfriend.

58:31.683 --> 58:34.110
I want you to take plenty of pictures of her.

58:35.061 --> 58:36.228
Over here, honey, over here.

58:36.229 --> 58:37.989
Look over here at the camera, honey.

58:38.190 --> 58:39.482
Where're you from, honey?

58:39.483 --> 58:40.742
Kansas City.

58:57.417 --> 58:58.501
Who the hell are you?

58:58.502 --> 59:00.136
Get going, fella!

59:00.921 --> 59:02.180
Miller.

59:09.304 --> 59:10.346
Christ!

59:10.347 --> 59:11.731
Billy Lo!

01:00:11.366 --> 01:00:12.333
Carl!

01:00:13.410 --> 01:00:14.878
Carl, you all right?

01:01:02.375 --> 01:01:03.676
Something's wrong!

01:01:05.045 --> 01:01:07.138
Carl, what's happening?

01:01:09.215 --> 01:01:10.725
Carl! Open the door.

01:01:19.392 --> 01:01:20.434
What's the matter in there?

01:01:20.435 --> 01:01:21.861
Open the door!

01:02:20.203 --> 01:02:22.005
You lose Carl Miller!

01:02:23.832 --> 01:02:25.508
Carl! Carl!

01:02:27.836 --> 01:02:29.012
Look at him!

01:02:29.170 --> 01:02:31.681
- Jesus!
- Jesus! Look at him!

01:02:35.278 --> 01:02:40.106
He was killed with 100 people outside the door.

01:02:41.266 --> 01:02:44.777
They found a wig and the mask of an old man

01:02:45.145 --> 01:02:46.112
Yes, sir.

01:02:46.396 --> 01:02:51.275
And everyone just stood around doing nothing?

01:02:51.276 --> 01:02:53.402
You and 100 other people! Isn't that true?

01:02:53.403 --> 01:02:54.278
Yes, sir.

01:02:54.279 --> 01:02:57.239
You say that the girl is with the
newspaperman now?

01:02:57.240 --> 01:02:58.333
Yes, sir.

01:03:03.288 --> 01:03:06.799
You admitted...that you could've killed someone.

01:03:07.167 --> 01:03:12.722
In that state of mind...
do you still think it's Billy's voice?

01:03:12.964 --> 01:03:16.184
I told you before, I wouldn't mistake
Billy's voice.

01:03:19.387 --> 01:03:21.064
Can't you believe me?

01:03:21.139 --> 01:03:22.565
That's one of my weaknesses.

01:03:23.099 --> 01:03:25.109
I'm one of the world's most gullible men.

01:03:25.977 --> 01:03:27.278
I'll take you home.

01:03:27.312 --> 01:03:28.645
No, no, that's all right.

01:03:28.646 --> 01:03:30.481
I have my car right outside.

01:03:30.482 --> 01:03:31.657
You sure?

01:03:32.942 --> 01:03:35.828
You can leave this here. Okay?

01:03:37.238 --> 01:03:38.790
Yeah.

01:03:46.206 --> 01:03:47.498
She's coming back!

01:03:47.499 --> 01:03:49.041
Well, don't let her out of your sight!

01:03:49.042 --> 01:03:52.345
Put a couple of guys
on that newpaper man.

01:03:52.504 --> 01:03:53.638
Yes, sir.

01:03:54.130 --> 01:03:55.339
You two stay with Marshall.

01:03:55.340 --> 01:03:56.516
We'll follow the girl.

01:04:07.143 --> 01:04:08.569
Steiner?

01:04:10.313 --> 01:04:14.992
I'm now convinced that the man
who attacked me was in disguise.

01:04:15.819 --> 01:04:17.495
The way he moved.

01:04:18.780 --> 01:04:22.583
You know something, Doctor,
if I wasn't positive that Billy was dead...

01:04:23.118 --> 01:04:24.836
Did you look in the casket?

01:04:24.869 --> 01:04:26.254
At the mortuary?

01:04:26.329 --> 01:04:28.131
Of course I looked in the casket.

01:04:28.915 --> 01:04:30.124
He didn't look exactly the same,

01:04:30.125 --> 01:04:32.334
but what the hell,
they never look exactly the same.

01:04:32.335 --> 01:04:33.544
Where was he buried?

01:04:33.545 --> 01:04:35.763
The Buddhist cemetery, Hanchow Road.

01:04:36.339 --> 01:04:37.974
Have him dug up.

01:04:49.310 --> 01:04:50.394
Yeah, Marshall.

01:04:50.395 --> 01:04:51.571
Hi, Jim.

01:04:51.896 --> 01:04:53.906
Billy, I've heard all about it.

01:04:54.524 --> 01:04:56.233
Ann is convinced you're alive.

01:04:56.234 --> 01:04:57.743
I had to risk it.

01:04:57.902 --> 01:05:00.487
I thought she was going to shoot Carl
or one of the others.

01:05:00.488 --> 01:05:02.748
Well, she still may kill somebody.

01:05:02.907 --> 01:05:03.615
I've got the gun.

01:05:03.616 --> 01:05:05.492
But if she sits around and thinks about it

01:05:05.493 --> 01:05:07.244
she might get the crazies again.

01:05:07.245 --> 01:05:08.245
OK.

01:05:08.246 --> 01:05:10.673
I'll meet her in the school in South Hampton.

01:05:11.457 --> 01:05:12.467
What time?

01:05:12.792 --> 01:05:13.750
In an hour.

01:05:13.751 --> 01:05:15.794
OK. If I can find her.

01:05:15.795 --> 01:05:18.714
I'll ring you up again at 10 to let you know
how it went.

01:05:18.715 --> 01:05:19.932
Fine.

01:06:46.052 --> 01:06:47.645
Thank you, gentlemen.

01:07:19.085 --> 01:07:20.344
Billy?

01:07:24.674 --> 01:07:25.683
Billy!

01:07:35.601 --> 01:07:37.352
I wasn't going to see you again.

01:07:37.353 --> 01:07:39.521
I didn't want you to see me.

01:07:39.522 --> 01:07:40.948
Billy, it's all right!

01:07:41.065 --> 01:07:42.482
I'm not just anybody.

01:07:42.483 --> 01:07:42.941
No.

01:07:42.942 --> 01:07:44.827
You don't need to say that to me.

01:07:44.986 --> 01:07:46.078
Maybe later.

01:07:46.237 --> 01:07:48.789
But I have to get used to myself first.

01:07:48.823 --> 01:07:51.533
The man she's talking to has to be Billy Lo.

01:07:51.534 --> 01:07:54.119
Yes. Well, we just had word from the cemetery,

01:07:54.120 --> 01:07:56.172
so I'm not in the least surprised.

01:07:56.497 --> 01:07:58.373
Now, we're sending you some help.

01:07:58.374 --> 01:08:01.084
They're close by and they should be
there very shortly.

01:08:01.085 --> 01:08:03.346
Ann, you could've just been killed.

01:08:03.546 --> 01:08:06.307
They would hurt you.

01:08:06.549 --> 01:08:08.008
Go back to the States!

01:08:08.009 --> 01:08:09.769
Please! Will you do that?

01:08:12.096 --> 01:08:13.814
Billy, I can't.

01:08:19.062 --> 01:08:20.729
Get in your car and go!

01:08:20.729 --> 01:08:22.365
They're still a few blocks away.

01:08:22.607 --> 01:08:23.823
Go!

01:08:28.112 --> 01:08:29.455
Go!

01:08:33.658 --> 01:08:34.408
They split up.

01:08:34.410 --> 01:08:35.660
She's going to her car.

01:08:35.661 --> 01:08:36.921
Where's he going?

01:08:37.412 --> 01:08:39.747
To the other side of the orphanage, I think.

01:08:39.749 --> 01:08:41.666
Get some guys to follow him

01:08:41.667 --> 01:08:44.752
take two more men and pick her up.

01:08:44.754 --> 01:08:46.389
We can use her for bait.

01:09:53.113 --> 01:09:54.373
Call him over.

01:09:55.533 --> 01:09:56.792
Mister Marshall?

01:09:58.369 --> 01:10:00.254
Somebody wants to talk to you.

01:10:08.171 --> 01:10:10.222
A little closer, Mr Marshall.

01:10:19.765 --> 01:10:21.817
Miss Morris was picked up tonight.

01:10:22.059 --> 01:10:24.820
Billy's going to call you at about 10 o'clock.

01:10:26.105 --> 01:10:27.782
You tapped my phone.

01:10:28.900 --> 01:10:29.909
How clever.

01:10:30.067 --> 01:10:36.874
Tell Billy to come to the
Tai Yuen Warehouse in Kowloon

01:10:37.783 --> 01:10:40.169
We'll let the girl go when Billy comes in.

01:10:40.411 --> 01:10:41.754
One for one.

01:10:41.787 --> 01:10:43.205
Why should I believe you'll do that?

01:10:43.206 --> 01:10:45.874
Don't change the equation, Mister Marshall.

01:10:45.875 --> 01:10:47.051
One for one.

01:10:47.418 --> 01:10:49.053
Don't add any numbers.

01:10:49.253 --> 01:10:51.388
Billy for the girl. It's that simple.

01:10:52.215 --> 01:10:53.349
Oh, and Mister Marshall,

01:10:54.842 --> 01:10:57.394
you should be very careful.

01:10:59.180 --> 01:11:02.066
You can learn a lot in a job like yours.

01:11:03.184 --> 01:11:06.195
But that can turn into a terrible burden.

01:11:08.231 --> 01:11:09.406
Good evening.

01:11:14.904 --> 01:11:16.112
Mister Marshall's desk.

01:11:16.113 --> 01:11:17.155
Is Jim there?

01:11:17.156 --> 01:11:18.791
No, he's...

01:11:19.200 --> 01:11:21.126
Oh, hold on a second. He just walked in.

01:11:30.628 --> 01:11:31.211
Yeah?

01:11:31.212 --> 01:11:32.045
Hi, Jim.

01:11:32.046 --> 01:11:33.138
Billy

01:11:35.800 --> 01:11:37.601
My phone is tapped.

01:11:39.345 --> 01:11:41.730
Ann is being held by the syndicate.

01:11:45.726 --> 01:11:47.352
I couldn't get her to leave.

01:11:47.353 --> 01:11:48.520
Have you talked to them?

01:11:48.521 --> 01:11:49.479
Just now.

01:11:49.480 --> 01:11:50.897
They want an exchange.

01:11:50.898 --> 01:11:52.324
You for her.

01:11:52.525 --> 01:11:53.483
They want you to go alone.

01:11:53.484 --> 01:11:55.202
Or so they say.

01:11:55.236 --> 01:11:56.695
You could go to the police.

01:11:56.696 --> 01:11:59.748
No! That would just get her killed.

01:12:00.992 --> 01:12:02.585
What do they want me to do?

01:12:07.206 --> 01:12:08.507
Stick!

01:12:09.375 --> 01:12:12.011
You better go over there and back them up.

01:12:12.378 --> 01:12:13.878
Just to make sure.

01:12:13.879 --> 01:12:15.880
We've got six men over there already.

01:12:15.881 --> 01:12:18.434
Well, we had a pack of men in Macau!

01:12:27.435 --> 01:12:28.652
Here he comes.

01:12:40.948 --> 01:12:42.458
He's inside. Let's get him.

01:12:46.829 --> 01:12:48.130
Ann?

01:12:49.206 --> 01:12:50.424
Ann?

01:12:52.293 --> 01:12:53.469
Ann!

01:13:12.938 --> 01:13:14.114
Let's go!

01:13:18.277 --> 01:13:19.411
Billy!

01:13:19.987 --> 01:13:20.996
Billy!

01:13:23.240 --> 01:13:23.573
Hurry!

01:13:23.574 --> 01:13:24.783
We have to move quickly.

01:13:24.784 --> 01:13:25.950
Billy, quick, they're across the street!

01:13:25.951 --> 01:13:27.035
They're across the street!

01:13:27.036 --> 01:13:28.420
Hurry! Hurry!

01:13:44.095 --> 01:13:45.011
It's barricaded.

01:13:45.012 --> 01:13:46.438
Try the windows!

01:13:51.060 --> 01:13:52.903
Try to walk. Hurry!

01:14:00.903 --> 01:14:03.622
Don't show yourself no matter what you hear!

01:14:03.823 --> 01:14:05.582
Yeah, OK.

01:14:30.099 --> 01:14:31.150
Let's go!

01:14:31.392 --> 01:14:32.735
Let's go!

01:14:34.228 --> 01:14:35.571
You two take the aisles!

01:14:37.022 --> 01:14:38.115
You take the front.

01:16:29.218 --> 01:16:29.926
Chewy!

01:16:29.927 --> 01:16:31.145
Look for the others!

01:16:47.069 --> 01:16:48.078
Take the back!

01:16:48.195 --> 01:16:49.621
You take the back.

01:16:51.740 --> 01:16:53.000
Take off the helmet!

01:16:53.534 --> 01:16:55.127
Take off the helmet!

01:16:57.663 --> 01:16:59.464
Chewy!

01:19:12.548 --> 01:19:13.682
Shit!

01:20:15.110 --> 01:20:17.621
Where's the Doctor?

01:20:19.823 --> 01:20:22.626
Red Pepper

01:20:24.328 --> 01:20:26.129
Red Pepper Restaurant?

01:20:26.914 --> 01:20:28.715
Yeah

01:20:35.172 --> 01:20:36.515
Stick!

01:20:37.841 --> 01:20:38.424
Stick!

01:20:38.425 --> 01:20:40.435
I better alert Hakim and Pasquel.

01:20:46.391 --> 01:20:49.736
Anybody in the warehouse? Po!

01:20:49.895 --> 01:20:50.853
Damn it! That's impossible!

01:20:50.854 --> 01:20:52.114
Po!

01:24:27.362 --> 01:24:28.830
How do you like that?

01:33:36.703 --> 01:33:38.045
Hakim?

01:33:39.581 --> 01:33:40.923
Hakim?

01:33:43.501 --> 01:33:44.886
Hakim?

01:33:57.599 --> 01:33:58.900
Hakim?

01:34:06.024 --> 01:34:07.700
Glad you could finally make it, Billy.

01:35:37.615 --> 01:35:38.874
Shit!

01:36:40.136 --> 01:36:41.520
Wax!

01:37:49.664 --> 01:37:51.164
Oh, son of a bitch!

01:37:51.165 --> 01:37:55.136
Goddam bastards!

01:38:17.608 --> 01:38:20.360
<i># Will this be the song #</i>

01:38:20.361 --> 01:38:26.292
<i># I'll be singing tomorrow? #</i>

01:38:28.119 --> 01:38:31.997

<i># sail on into the sky? #</i>

01:38:37.628 --> 01:38:42.349

<i># One that makes my heart go crazy? #</i>

01:38:48.097 --> 01:38:54.978
