Here it is.
Here it is.

01:20.901 --> 01:22.367
What? What?

01:22.400 --> 01:26.067
 <i>"Charles Darwin Tonight,</i>
 starring Bobby Wheeler."

01:26.100 --> 01:27.834
We made enough money in
the first two weeks

01:27.868 --> 01:29.434
of the show to run
an ad in the paper.

01:29.467 --> 01:30.734
Ooh! Let me see!

01:30.767 --> 01:33.667
"A one-man show based on the
life of Charles Darwin."

01:33.701 --> 01:36.901
When I first read the script,
I said to myself,

01:36.934 --> 01:39.400
"There's something
about this play

01:39.434 --> 01:41.033
that I would go see."

01:41.067 --> 01:42.200
What?

01:42.234 --> 01:45.767
Me, alone on stage
for 90 minutes.

01:45.801 --> 01:47.534
LOUIE:
90 minutes?!

01:47.567 --> 01:49.634
I didn't know ham
could keep that long

01:49.667 --> 01:51.534
under hot lights.

01:52.667 --> 01:54.734
Food's here, guys.
Hey, hey!

01:54.767 --> 01:55.734
Great!
We're starving!

01:55.767 --> 01:56.734
All right!

01:56.767 --> 01:57.901
I could use some
of that stuff.

01:57.934 --> 01:59.234
Yeah.
Hey, you know what?

01:59.267 --> 02:00.400
What?

02:00.434 --> 02:01.634
They gave us
extra contest coupons.

02:01.667 --> 02:03.200
What contest is that?
BOBBY:
Hey!

02:03.234 --> 02:05.567
Oh, they give you a coupon
with every purchase.

02:05.601 --> 02:06.901
If you get two coupons
that match,

02:06.934 --> 02:08.501
you get the prize
that's in 'em.

02:08.533 --> 02:10.601
Come on, tell me something.

02:10.633 --> 02:12.234
Have you ever met,
or do you know, anybody

02:12.267 --> 02:14.701
who's ever won one
of those contests?

02:14.734 --> 02:15.701
I do.

02:15.734 --> 02:16.734
Who?

02:16.767 --> 02:18.701
Me. I have won.

02:18.734 --> 02:19.701
I have a match.

02:19.734 --> 02:21.834
( <i>all cheering</i> )

02:21.868 --> 02:23.868
I won a complete
men's wardrobe.

02:23.901 --> 02:25.367
Hey, congratulations, Latka.

02:25.400 --> 02:28.534
Ooh! Is that the first time
you've ever won anything?

02:28.567 --> 02:31.267
No. Once, in my country,
one year,

02:31.300 --> 02:33.868
I won the prize in the lottery.

02:33.901 --> 02:35.801
Oh, yeah? What'd you win--
money, Latka?

02:35.834 --> 02:38.100
No, no. A fly swatter.

02:39.334 --> 02:40.367
That's some lottery.

02:40.400 --> 02:42.467
That doesn't sound
like much of a prize, Latka.

02:42.501 --> 02:46.234
No, he was a good worker
and a very nice man.

02:46.267 --> 02:49.100
Anyway, I got to go...

02:49.133 --> 02:52.234
I got to go and pick
up my new threads.

02:52.267 --> 02:53.734
See you, Latka.

02:53.767 --> 02:56.167
( <i>mutters</i> ):
I don't believe this.

02:56.200 --> 02:58.501
Did anybody happen to read
John Bowman's review

02:58.534 --> 03:00.834
 on Anouilh's
 <i>Thieves' Carnival</i>

03:00.868 --> 03:02.534
in this morning's paper?

03:02.567 --> 03:04.834
No, I didn't.

03:07.000 --> 03:11.300
Did you read the story...
about the woman...

03:11.334 --> 03:16.000
who got her cat's head
stuck in her mouth?

03:20.167 --> 03:22.801
No, Jim, I missed
that one.

03:22.834 --> 03:24.501
Well...

03:26.400 --> 03:27.534
( <i>clears throat</i> )

03:27.567 --> 03:29.234
...let me find it
for you.

03:31.834 --> 03:34.767
L-Let me do mine
first, okay?

03:34.801 --> 03:37.434
John Bowman is one of
the biggest critics

03:37.467 --> 03:38.901
in New York City,

03:38.934 --> 03:40.501
and one of the worst,
if you ask me.

03:40.534 --> 03:42.667
I mean, he hates
everything he sees.

03:42.701 --> 03:44.701
I mean, the man
does not critique,

03:44.734 --> 03:45.834
he humiliates.

03:45.868 --> 03:48.667
He's not a reviewer,
he's an assassin.

03:48.701 --> 03:50.801
Here, here, here, look, look.
Read this.

03:50.834 --> 03:52.667
Read it for
yourself.

03:52.701 --> 03:54.667
"A 30-millimeter cannon

03:54.701 --> 03:57.334
"fired at the stage
during production

03:57.367 --> 04:00.200
could not hit anything
worth saving."

04:00.234 --> 04:02.200
Hey, I'd like to see that.

04:02.234 --> 04:03.434
What time do they
shoot off the cannon?

04:05.334 --> 04:07.667
"Forgettable as all
the performances may be,

04:07.701 --> 04:11.534
"that of Patty Ganzel seems
to vanish before your eyes.

04:11.567 --> 04:13.868
"Not only is
her acting suspect,

04:13.901 --> 04:15.634
"but her appearance
is so horrifying

04:15.667 --> 04:17.868
"that it should henceforth
be a felony

04:17.901 --> 04:20.701
to yell 'Patty Ganzel'
in a crowded theater."

04:20.733 --> 04:22.701
Ooh! Ouch!
Ow!

04:22.734 --> 04:24.400
That is not
a nice review.

04:24.434 --> 04:27.100
This is not a nice man.

04:27.133 --> 04:30.367
But the terrible part is,
is he has power.

04:30.400 --> 04:32.868
Hey, I saw this play,
and it wasn't that bad.

04:32.901 --> 04:35.868
I mean, it needed work,
but it didn't need to be killed

04:35.901 --> 04:39.067
and I know Patty,
and she doesn't deserve this.

04:39.100 --> 04:42.634
But, Bobby, he's a critic,
so, uh, so what can you do?

04:42.667 --> 04:45.400
I tell you exactly what
I can do.

04:45.434 --> 04:48.267
I can write this guy a letter
and tell him what I think of him

04:48.300 --> 04:49.934
as a critic
and as a human being.

04:49.968 --> 04:51.501
All right, Bobby.

04:51.534 --> 04:52.834
You know, better yet,

04:52.868 --> 04:54.834
I'm going to write
the newspaper,

04:54.868 --> 04:56.501
so everybody
can read it!

04:56.534 --> 04:58.133
Ooh! Good idea!
I'm gonna get you some paper.

04:58.167 --> 05:00.834
Oh, good.
Okay. All right.

05:00.868 --> 05:02.601
Oh, boy, I'm gonna
tell 'em exactly...

05:02.634 --> 05:03.767
Bobby, you really serious
about this thing?

05:03.801 --> 05:05.100
You bet I am.

05:05.133 --> 05:07.434
Well, then open up
on him, Bob.

05:07.467 --> 05:08.601
No, no, you see, Tony,

05:08.634 --> 05:10.234
I have to handle this
with some finesse.

05:10.267 --> 05:13.167
You see, I don't want
to sink to his level.

05:13.200 --> 05:14.167
Uh, Bobby?

05:14.200 --> 05:15.267
Yeah?

05:15.300 --> 05:17.434
"Slime wad" is two words.

05:17.467 --> 05:19.133
Oh. Thanks.

05:19.167 --> 05:20.801
My pleasure.

05:20.834 --> 05:25.200
Okay, now. "Your reviews are..."

05:25.234 --> 05:28.434
Listen, I really need
some, like, strong adjectives.

05:28.467 --> 05:30.300
Uh, how about
"reprehensible"?

05:30.334 --> 05:31.701
Oh, that's good.

05:31.734 --> 05:33.234
"Indecent."

05:33.267 --> 05:34.300
Perfect!

05:34.334 --> 05:36.167
"Purple."

05:39.767 --> 05:41.367
Not as close.

05:41.400 --> 05:42.934
Ah.

05:44.501 --> 05:45.734
Good.

05:45.767 --> 05:46.734
TONY:
Good, good, yeah.

05:46.767 --> 05:47.968
Yeah.

05:48.000 --> 05:55.267
Signed,
"Robert L. Wheeler, an actor."

05:55.300 --> 05:57.767
Boy, I'd hate to
get that letter.

05:57.801 --> 05:59.901
That is very strong.

05:59.934 --> 06:00.968
Yes, it is, and it's

06:01.000 --> 06:03.467
a very angry letter
to a very powerful man, Bob.

06:03.501 --> 06:06.801
Yes, and he is really gonna
know who you are after
he gets this letter.

06:08.067 --> 06:10.567
I don't think I need "hate"
in this sentence.

06:10.601 --> 06:12.567
Bobby, Bobby, don't
change nothing, man.

06:12.601 --> 06:13.634
It's perfect.

06:13.667 --> 06:16.067
This guy will go crazy
when he gets that letter.

06:16.100 --> 06:18.200
You know, you're right.

06:18.234 --> 06:20.033
I can't send this.

06:20.067 --> 06:21.200
What are you doing?

06:21.234 --> 06:22.467
Ah...

06:22.501 --> 06:23.467
What are you doing?

06:23.501 --> 06:24.734
I can't send this, Tony.

06:24.767 --> 06:26.901
Bowman will have me
for breakfast.

06:26.934 --> 06:29.234
Maybe someday,
when I'm a big star--

06:29.267 --> 06:30.834
you know, then he
can't hurt me--

06:30.868 --> 06:33.567
but right now,
I'm a struggling young actor

06:33.601 --> 06:35.567
and I got to protect myself.

06:35.601 --> 06:36.567
LOUIE:
Wheeler.

06:36.601 --> 06:37.701
Let's drive.

06:37.734 --> 06:40.234
I think you did
the smart thing, Bob.

06:40.267 --> 06:42.067
I think you chickened out, Bob.

06:42.100 --> 06:43.934
Tony, I didn't
chicken out.

06:43.968 --> 06:46.567
That letter could have
cost me my career.

06:47.567 --> 06:49.501
ALEX:
You did a smart
thing, Bob.
Iggy?

06:49.534 --> 06:50.901
Yo.

06:50.934 --> 06:52.934
Minus ten
and counting.

07:17.400 --> 07:19.133
I can't do this.

07:21.234 --> 07:23.567
It could ruin his career.

07:30.234 --> 07:32.133
Fate.

08:03.534 --> 08:04.534
Stop that!

08:04.567 --> 08:06.367
What are you doing?

08:06.400 --> 08:08.901
What are you dressed
like that for?

08:08.934 --> 08:11.901
I won it
in the hamburger contest.

08:11.934 --> 08:14.701
Get those things off.

08:14.734 --> 08:16.067
Geez.

08:38.767 --> 08:41.400
Hey, has anybody seen
today's paper yet?

08:41.433 --> 08:43.299
No.
No, I didn't.

08:43.333 --> 08:47.567
Did the lady get the cat's head
out of her mouth?

08:47.601 --> 08:49.434
Come on, Jim,
who cares about that?

08:49.467 --> 08:53.334
Well, I know a cat and a lady
who care plenty.

08:54.434 --> 08:55.734
Come on,
what's in the paper?

08:55.767 --> 08:57.868
Look at that, it's Bobby's
letter, he sent it in--

08:57.901 --> 08:59.067
the one about John Bowman.

08:59.100 --> 09:00.234
All right, Bobby.
He sent the letter.

09:00.267 --> 09:02.067
He must have
changed his mind.

09:02.100 --> 09:04.400
Yeah, it took a lot of courage
for him to send that one in.

09:04.434 --> 09:06.634
Yeah, a whole <i>lot</i> of courage.

09:06.667 --> 09:09.033
An incredible amount of courage.

09:10.100 --> 09:11.434
It wasn't Bobby.

09:11.467 --> 09:12.834
Nah, not him.

09:12.868 --> 09:15.434
No. Somebody must have
gone through the trash can

09:15.467 --> 09:16.901
and, uh, sent the letter
to the paper

09:16.934 --> 09:18.200
without Bobby
knowing about it.

09:18.234 --> 09:19.968
Ah, who could be so rotten?

09:20.000 --> 09:21.968
( <i>bell dings</i> )

09:24.968 --> 09:26.634
Louie, how could you?

09:26.667 --> 09:29.501
Do you realize this could
cost Bobby his career?

09:29.534 --> 09:33.033
Louie, could I talk to you
for a minute?

09:33.067 --> 09:35.434
I kinda figured you'd wanna.

09:35.467 --> 09:37.300
( <i>cackling</i> )

09:39.033 --> 09:41.267
I kind of figured you'd do that,

09:41.300 --> 09:44.467
so I came prepared
to get into that cage.

09:44.501 --> 09:47.133
He's going to get in the cage--

09:47.167 --> 09:48.467
this fortress--

09:48.501 --> 09:50.634
he's going to get in.

09:50.667 --> 09:52.467
No way.

09:52.501 --> 09:54.601
This is hermetically
sealed, this cage.

10:00.167 --> 10:01.634
All right.

10:01.667 --> 10:03.567
All right, now,
don't come near me.

10:03.601 --> 10:04.567
I mean it.

10:04.601 --> 10:06.067
I'm going to get him
this time!

10:06.100 --> 10:07.534
Nobody... nothing's
gonna stop me!

10:07.567 --> 10:09.234
Hey, Bobby, it's your agent.

10:09.267 --> 10:13.033
My agent's calling <i>me?!</i>

10:13.067 --> 10:15.400
Okay, okay, Louie,
you stay right there.

10:15.434 --> 10:16.734
Alex, come over here.

10:16.767 --> 10:18.100
Take this.

10:18.133 --> 10:19.801
Make sure he doesn't
slither out of there.

10:19.834 --> 10:20.934
ALEX:
Yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah.

10:20.968 --> 10:23.100
Louie, you know, I've had it.

10:23.133 --> 10:24.434
You've had enough.

10:24.467 --> 10:26.767
You've really done it this time.

10:26.801 --> 10:29.767
When you sent that letter in,
you went one step too far.

10:29.801 --> 10:30.801
Here, Bob.

10:32.467 --> 10:33.534
Hello?

10:33.567 --> 10:35.601
Yeah, hi.

10:35.634 --> 10:39.601
Listen, uh, about that letter.

10:39.634 --> 10:42.100
It was a big mist...

10:42.133 --> 10:43.934
Real... Really?!

10:43.968 --> 10:48.267
Hey, well, that's really
nice of you to say.

10:48.300 --> 10:49.934
That's, uh...

10:49.968 --> 10:52.634
Well, yeah, I guess it did
take a little courage to send it

10:52.667 --> 10:54.634
but I've had that guy
up to here,

10:54.667 --> 10:56.133
you know what I mean?

10:56.167 --> 10:57.300
And you know what?

10:57.334 --> 10:58.801
I'm going to send him
another one!

10:58.834 --> 11:00.334
Yeah! Yeah!

11:00.367 --> 11:01.968
Thanks. Thanks a lot.

11:02.000 --> 11:03.667
Talk to you again sometime.

11:03.701 --> 11:04.968
That was my agent.

11:05.000 --> 11:06.400
He called <i>me.</i>

11:06.434 --> 11:09.267
He liked the letter
that I wrote to John Bowman.

11:09.300 --> 11:10.534
Whoo-hoo!

11:10.567 --> 11:13.801
That's not the only call
you got this morning, Bob.

11:13.834 --> 11:15.567
What are you talking about?

11:15.601 --> 11:18.901
I'm afraid my little scheme
backfired on me.

11:18.934 --> 11:21.901
I've been taking messages
for you all morning--

11:21.934 --> 11:25.434
all of them from people
congratulating you

11:25.467 --> 11:26.434
on the stand you made.

11:26.467 --> 11:27.934
Yeah?

11:27.968 --> 11:30.100
Yep. Here's one
from your union president.

11:30.133 --> 11:32.667
"Tell him
we're proud of him."

11:32.701 --> 11:34.434
Here's another one--

11:34.467 --> 11:37.234
"...a credit
to our profession."

11:37.267 --> 11:39.434
Here's one
from a repertory company.

11:39.467 --> 11:42.968
"We wish we had the guts
to do it."

11:43.000 --> 11:43.968
Look at that.

11:44.000 --> 11:46.200
Holy...!

11:46.234 --> 11:49.200
There's some
really big names here.

11:49.234 --> 11:50.501
Oh, wow!

11:50.534 --> 11:52.834
Now I'm a hero <i>and</i>
great-looking.

11:56.467 --> 11:58.133
I'm proud of you, Bobby.

11:58.167 --> 11:59.734
You pounded that guy. Oh!

11:59.767 --> 12:01.000
And that is not all.

12:01.033 --> 12:02.334
What, what, what?

12:02.367 --> 12:04.434
I got one here
from your producer,

12:04.467 --> 12:06.567
who said to tell you that
because of your letter

12:06.601 --> 12:08.734
and the attention
that it's drawn,

12:08.767 --> 12:10.801
ticket sales have gone crazy.

12:10.834 --> 12:12.601
All right!

12:12.634 --> 12:13.801
( <i>whooping</i> )

12:13.834 --> 12:16.067
Hey, I may even
get paid this week.

12:16.100 --> 12:17.567
ALEX:
It paid off
this time, eh?

12:17.601 --> 12:19.567
And...
What?

12:19.601 --> 12:22.367
I saved the best
for last.

12:22.400 --> 12:23.601
What?

12:23.634 --> 12:26.367
Your producer also told me
to tell you

12:26.400 --> 12:31.267
that a certain very special VIP

12:31.300 --> 12:33.434
called personally

12:33.467 --> 12:36.701
and asked for tickets
for your show for tonight.

12:36.734 --> 12:38.734
To see me?

12:38.767 --> 12:40.701
Especially to see you.

12:40.734 --> 12:41.767
Ooh! Who is it?

12:41.801 --> 12:42.868
Guess.

12:42.901 --> 12:44.267
Oh, come on, Louie,
I can't guess.

12:44.300 --> 12:46.267
Is it somebody,
like, real big?

12:46.300 --> 12:47.434
I mean, come on,
give me a hint.

12:47.467 --> 12:48.767
Big name.
Big name, Bob.

12:48.801 --> 12:50.100
Oh, come on.

12:50.133 --> 12:51.167
Big.

12:51.200 --> 12:52.267
Please, please,
tell me, tell me.

12:52.300 --> 12:54.200
No, no, no, no,
you gotta guess.

12:54.234 --> 12:55.868
No, no, no...

12:55.901 --> 12:56.968
no, you gotta guess.

12:57.000 --> 12:58.901
No! All right,
I'll give you hints.

12:58.934 --> 13:00.067
Oh, oh, good, good,
good, good.

13:00.100 --> 13:01.000
Okay, all right,
listen.

13:01.033 --> 13:02.033
Are you ready?
Yeah. Yah-huh.

13:02.067 --> 13:03.367
Good.

13:03.400 --> 13:04.367
Two.

13:04.400 --> 13:06.234
Oh, uh, two words.

13:06.267 --> 13:07.400
Two, uh, names.

13:07.434 --> 13:09.334
Uh, first name.

13:14.234 --> 13:15.000
Sign.

13:15.033 --> 13:16.567
Uh, rest rooms.

13:16.601 --> 13:19.067
Uh... <i>From Here To Eternity.</i>

13:20.734 --> 13:22.400
Jim, Jim--
shh, shh, shh.

13:22.434 --> 13:23.868
Wait. Wait.

13:23.901 --> 13:24.767
John?

13:24.801 --> 13:25.767
Right.

13:25.801 --> 13:26.767
All right!

13:26.801 --> 13:28.767
Uh, second name.

13:30.767 --> 13:31.734
Bing!

13:31.767 --> 13:32.734
Arrow.

13:32.767 --> 13:33.934
Oh, oh--

13:33.968 --> 13:34.934
Robin Hood.

13:34.968 --> 13:38.801
Uh, <i>The Magnificent Seven.</i>

13:38.834 --> 13:40.868
Jim, Jim, shh. Wait.

13:40.901 --> 13:42.767
Uh, okay. Uh, John. John.

13:42.801 --> 13:44.601
John Archer. John Shooter.

13:44.634 --> 13:46.033
John...

13:46.067 --> 13:47.033
Bowman.

13:47.067 --> 13:47.868
BOBBY:
Bowman!
Right!

13:47.901 --> 13:49.601
John Bowman!

13:49.634 --> 13:52.767
John Bowman the critic
is coming to see me?

13:52.801 --> 13:54.434
Oh, it's John Bowman!

13:54.467 --> 13:55.801
John Bowman...

13:57.334 --> 13:58.367
The guy I insulted

13:58.400 --> 14:03.434
is coming to review me
and rip me limb to limb.

14:03.467 --> 14:05.634
Oh, God.
Bing.

14:19.334 --> 14:22.667
For my own part,
I'd as soon be descended

14:22.701 --> 14:25.000
from that heroic little monkey

14:25.033 --> 14:27.534
who braved his
most dreaded enemy

14:27.567 --> 14:29.801
to save the life of his keeper,

14:29.834 --> 14:32.534
as from a savage

14:32.567 --> 14:36.133
who delights
to torture his enemies,

14:36.167 --> 14:40.133
practices infanticide
with no remorse,

14:40.167 --> 14:41.968
knows no decency...

14:42.000 --> 14:47.234
and is haunted
by the grossest superstitions.

14:47.267 --> 14:50.200
( <i>crowd cheering</i> )

14:54.267 --> 14:56.834
Coffee will be served
during the intermission

14:56.868 --> 14:59.534
in the lobby.

14:59.567 --> 15:01.033
Hey, Bob,

15:01.067 --> 15:02.434
that was...

15:02.467 --> 15:04.267
A disaster.

15:04.300 --> 15:06.434
No, Bobby.

15:06.467 --> 15:08.267
The play stinks.

15:08.300 --> 15:10.067
I stink.

15:10.100 --> 15:12.334
Oh, come on, Bob.

15:12.367 --> 15:14.100
Oh, no, oh,
Bowman hates it.

15:14.133 --> 15:16.000
Bowman hates it,
and I bet you

15:16.033 --> 15:18.033
he is loving
hating it, too.

15:19.834 --> 15:21.133
Bobby.

15:21.167 --> 15:22.467
That was great.

15:22.501 --> 15:24.567
That was just great.

15:24.601 --> 15:27.033
You know, this is the first time
I ever see it

15:27.067 --> 15:29.200
and I don't know
why everybody say

15:29.234 --> 15:31.033
it is too long and boring.

15:31.067 --> 15:32.534
You know, I enjoyed it

15:32.567 --> 15:35.200
and to me, I think
it was just right.

15:35.234 --> 15:37.701
Well, there's a second
act coming up, Latka.

15:37.734 --> 15:39.200
Not for me,
there isn't.

15:39.234 --> 15:41.067
Eh, good-bye.
Good-bye.

15:44.200 --> 15:48.634
Bobby... it's going great--

15:48.667 --> 15:49.868
better than the last time.

15:49.901 --> 15:52.133
Jim laughed through
the whole first act.

15:52.167 --> 15:55.901
Look, guys, I know
what you're doing

15:55.934 --> 15:58.234
and I really appreciate it

15:58.267 --> 16:01.934
but I know a bomb
when I've been hit by one.

16:03.868 --> 16:08.634
Ha! You crazy guy.

16:08.667 --> 16:10.367
Charles Darwin, eh?

16:10.400 --> 16:12.000
( <i>guffawing</i> )

16:12.033 --> 16:14.667
Loony!

16:14.701 --> 16:16.934
Thanks, Jim.
I'm glad you liked it.

16:16.968 --> 16:19.000
Hey, listen,
if you guys don't mind,

16:19.033 --> 16:21.334
I got to get myself
together, here.

16:21.367 --> 16:23.000
Oh, yeah.

16:23.033 --> 16:25.067
I age 40 years
in this thing.

16:25.100 --> 16:27.033
Yeah, I guess it feels
that way, huh?

16:27.067 --> 16:29.868
No, Darwin is 40 years
older in Act Two.

16:29.901 --> 16:30.968
Oh, oh, I'm sorry.
Yeah.

16:31.000 --> 16:32.968
Let's, um... we better
get outta here. Come on.

16:33.000 --> 16:34.334
They're gonna start
the second act.

16:34.367 --> 16:35.868
Come on,
let's get to our seats.

16:35.901 --> 16:38.100
Just a sec.

16:38.133 --> 16:38.701
Uh, Bobby?

16:38.734 --> 16:39.767
Hmm?

16:39.801 --> 16:42.033
Can I borrow your comb?

16:42.067 --> 16:43.400
Sure.

16:59.868 --> 17:01.667
Uh, Jim,

17:01.701 --> 17:04.467
why don't you just keep it?

17:04.501 --> 17:06.767
Oh.

17:06.800 --> 17:08.400
Thanks.

17:20.099 --> 17:21.233
Okay, Bob.

17:21.267 --> 17:22.567
Alex?

17:22.601 --> 17:24.099
Yeah?

17:26.601 --> 17:31.434
This is the worst night
of my entire life.

17:31.467 --> 17:32.934
Oh, no, Bob. Bob.

17:32.968 --> 17:34.267
You're doing great.

17:34.300 --> 17:35.667
Oh, yeah. Sure.

17:35.701 --> 17:37.634
( <i>sighs</i> )

17:43.400 --> 17:44.567
( <i>grunts</i> )

17:51.467 --> 17:56.167
( <i>audience applauding</i> )

17:56.200 --> 17:59.601
We will now discuss,
in further detail,

17:59.634 --> 18:02.200
the struggle for existence.

18:02.234 --> 18:05.767
( <i>Jim laughing hysterically</i> )

18:09.267 --> 18:12.834
You know,you <i>were</i>
very, very good tonight.

18:12.868 --> 18:14.467
No, I wasn't, Elaine.

18:14.501 --> 18:15.901
I stunk tonight.

18:15.934 --> 18:17.033
Oh, come on, Bob.
Stop being so hard
on yourself.

18:17.067 --> 18:19.300
Hey, Bobby,
I think you were great.

18:19.334 --> 18:22.968
I mean, in that second act,
you were sweating like a pig.

18:23.000 --> 18:26.133
I've never, never, never
seen anybody sweat like that.

18:26.167 --> 18:27.901
That's what I call talent.

18:27.934 --> 18:30.133
Well, unfortunately,
the only thing

18:30.167 --> 18:31.834
that matters
is what Bowman thinks

18:31.868 --> 18:33.634
and he's going
to rip me to shreds.

18:33.667 --> 18:34.534
ALEX:
Aw, come on.

18:34.567 --> 18:36.968
Oh, my God.

18:37.000 --> 18:39.934
John Bowman just
walked in the door.

18:39.968 --> 18:41.601
Don't look.

18:41.634 --> 18:43.567
Jim!

18:43.601 --> 18:45.267
Why would he be here?

18:45.300 --> 18:48.534
Well, maybe he's come
to kill me with his bare hands.

18:48.567 --> 18:50.000
( <i>low, indistinct speaking</i> )

18:54.801 --> 18:56.234
Mr. Wheeler?

18:56.267 --> 18:58.267
Uh, yes.

18:58.300 --> 19:00.667
They told me at the theater
I could find you here.

19:00.701 --> 19:02.434
My name is John Bowman

19:02.467 --> 19:04.133
or, as you referred
to me in your letter:

19:04.167 --> 19:06.834
"The carbuncle on the butt
of the American theater."

19:09.567 --> 19:11.868
Mr. Carbuncle?

19:13.834 --> 19:18.033
My name's Jim Ignatowski.

19:18.067 --> 19:21.100
Could I speak to you
for a moment in private?

19:21.133 --> 19:22.367
Sure!

19:23.267 --> 19:24.400
Will you all excuse us

19:24.434 --> 19:27.334
for a couple of minutes?

19:27.367 --> 19:30.200
Right this way, bunky.

19:30.234 --> 19:34.467
Jim! Jim, Jim, Jim,
he's talking to me.

19:34.501 --> 19:39.701
Oh. Gee, I feel kind of silly.

19:44.667 --> 19:47.033
Is he the playwright?

19:48.334 --> 19:50.033
Right over here.

19:51.367 --> 19:52.767
To be perfectly honest,
Mr. Wheeler,

19:52.801 --> 19:54.434
I went to
the theater tonight,

19:54.467 --> 19:57.734
expecting-- and hoping--
to hate everything I saw.

19:57.767 --> 19:58.968
I was disappointed.

19:59.000 --> 20:01.167
You mean you liked the play?

20:01.200 --> 20:02.434
Are you insane?

20:02.467 --> 20:04.367
That play is
an excellent argument

20:04.400 --> 20:07.601
for dying young.

20:07.634 --> 20:09.601
Then what did you
like about it?

20:09.634 --> 20:14.601
I thought your performance
was engaging and energetic...

20:14.634 --> 20:16.767
and, uh, courageous.

20:16.801 --> 20:19.501
Here. It's all here
in my review.

20:24.667 --> 20:27.968
"One of the most
promising young actors

20:28.000 --> 20:30.300
"to emerge this season...

20:30.334 --> 20:33.667
"...triumphs over
impossible material...

20:35.167 --> 20:37.634
"He made me feel optimistic

20:37.667 --> 20:41.167
about off-off-Broadway
theater again."

20:43.000 --> 20:44.634
Mr. Bowman...

20:44.667 --> 20:45.801
this is amazing.

20:45.834 --> 20:47.467
I have to apologize

20:47.501 --> 20:50.167
for everything that I
said in that letter.

20:50.200 --> 20:55.133
For you to come here
and show me this...

20:56.601 --> 20:59.300
...well, uh,
I'm overwhelmed.

21:00.934 --> 21:02.934
And people are
going to know

21:02.968 --> 21:04.801
that you have
a lot of integrity

21:04.834 --> 21:07.200
when this comes out
in the newspaper
in the morning.

21:07.234 --> 21:11.234
Well, too bad it's not going
to come out in the newspaper.

21:11.267 --> 21:14.200
What-what-what...
what are you doing?

21:14.234 --> 21:17.033
This is what you should have
done with your letter.

21:17.067 --> 21:19.033
You see, Mr. Wheeler,

21:19.067 --> 21:22.367
a bad review
could make you a hero.

21:22.400 --> 21:25.400
A good review
could make you a star.

21:25.434 --> 21:28.400
No review
will keep you anonymous

21:28.434 --> 21:31.901
and you can keep on acting
in church basements

21:31.934 --> 21:35.167
and supermarket openings,
and your own mirror

21:35.200 --> 21:37.400
for the rest of your life.

21:37.434 --> 21:41.767
Well, I enjoyed seeing you,
Mr. Wheeler.

21:41.801 --> 21:44.567
Ah, I've had
a wonderful evening.

21:44.601 --> 21:47.734
Hold it. Hold it. Now...

21:47.767 --> 21:54.234
you mean you came here
to show me this good review

21:54.267 --> 21:58.300
just to tear it up in my face?

21:59.634 --> 22:02.300
Well, that's the cruelest thing
I've ever seen.

22:03.567 --> 22:05.167
Thank you.

22:06.868 --> 22:07.834
BOBBY:
Please, reconsider.

22:07.868 --> 22:11.033
I'll tape it back together.

22:14.267 --> 22:15.367
What am I doing?

22:16.801 --> 22:20.567
I'm on my knees,
here on the floor,

22:20.601 --> 22:25.567
groveling in dirt and beer,
and for what?

22:25.601 --> 22:28.200
Because of what you think of me?

22:28.234 --> 22:30.734
Well, that's crazy.

22:32.300 --> 22:34.934
The only thing that matters

22:34.968 --> 22:38.834
is what <i>I</i> thought
of my performance tonight.

22:38.868 --> 22:41.601
( <i>grumbles</i> )

22:41.634 --> 22:42.968
Right!
Right on, Bob!
