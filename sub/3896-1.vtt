01:24.217 --> 01:25.284
You ready?

01:26.753 --> 01:28.153
Let's go.

01:30.757 --> 01:32.558
<i>And, this is it.</i>

01:32.560 --> 01:36.361
<i>Months of intense competition,
blood, sweat and tears,</i>

01:36.363 --> 01:38.597
<i>all boil down to
one final game.</i>

01:38.599 --> 01:42.034
<i>The Panthers have had
an unbelievable season.</i>

01:42.036 --> 01:47.072
<i>But they'll need to</i>
<i>pull out all the stops</i>
<i>to conquer the Titans tonight.</i>

01:54.380 --> 01:57.916
<i>Intramural sports don't get
much more exciting than this.</i>

02:08.828 --> 02:10.429
Hi, I'm Bill Costas,

02:10.431 --> 02:14.433
here, with my color commentary
counter-cultural counterpart,
Dan Albert.

02:14.435 --> 02:16.502
We are here,
at the IM championships.

02:16.504 --> 02:18.237
Dan, what do you think
about tonight's match-up?

02:18.239 --> 02:19.905
It's gonna be a doozy, Bill.

02:19.907 --> 02:22.107
The Panthers,
led by Caleb Fuller

02:22.109 --> 02:24.243
and his best bud,
Grant Rosenfalis,

02:24.245 --> 02:25.577
have had a Cinderella season,

02:25.579 --> 02:27.980
coming out of nowhere to
become a top competitor.

02:27.982 --> 02:29.414
And we see them
warming up right now

02:29.416 --> 02:30.749
with some
callisthenic chugging.

02:30.751 --> 02:33.252
Ah, the joys of
having a baby bladder
and a young liver.

02:33.254 --> 02:36.021
Absolutely.
But, I wouldn't count out
Dick Downs and his Titans.

02:36.023 --> 02:38.290
They have been
literally unstoppable

02:38.292 --> 02:40.025
all season long.
Killing it.

02:40.027 --> 02:42.928
Yes, and the smell
of sexual and
emotional repression

02:42.930 --> 02:44.863
is literally wafting
from the Titan's sidelines.

02:44.865 --> 02:47.432
Butt kicks! I want
those heels in your ass!

02:49.136 --> 02:51.103
Hey. Good luck.

02:51.938 --> 02:53.272
God!

02:53.274 --> 02:55.174
I don't know who you
think you are, Fuller.

02:55.176 --> 02:57.142
This is football,
not a goof-off game

02:57.144 --> 02:59.044
of butt-chugging
with the bros.

02:59.046 --> 03:00.212
You guys do that?

03:00.214 --> 03:02.047
Of course, I butt-chug.
Everybody butt-chugs.

03:02.049 --> 03:04.650
What are you talking about?
It gets you drunk quicker.

03:04.652 --> 03:06.018
And when would
you be doing this?

03:06.020 --> 03:08.020
At a party,
in a room with
your buddies.

03:08.022 --> 03:09.521
I don't know any
person who does that...

03:09.523 --> 03:11.723
Stop talking
about butt-chugging!
This is football.

03:11.725 --> 03:14.593
Relax, man.
It's just intramurals.

03:16.329 --> 03:17.563
Heads.

03:18.898 --> 03:21.133
I'm gonna kill you.

03:21.135 --> 03:22.815
What?
Mount.

03:25.138 --> 03:27.005
Bye.

03:27.007 --> 03:30.407
And that...
And that's the note
you wanna leave on?

03:38.852 --> 03:40.118
Got it!

04:15.922 --> 04:17.255
It's do or die, Bill,

04:17.257 --> 04:19.190
and with just
three seconds
left on the clock,

04:19.192 --> 04:22.027
the Panthers will
try for one more play
to pull out a miracle.

04:22.029 --> 04:23.695
This is it, cum junkies.

04:23.697 --> 04:27.733
Do not mess up
or I will smash your
faces in with bricks.

04:27.735 --> 04:29.034
I will go after...

04:29.036 --> 04:30.569
Look, here's what
we're gonna do.

04:30.571 --> 04:32.070
We're gonna run
the triple-Z, okay?

04:32.072 --> 04:34.072
Vinnie, you're
gonna give me the pitch.
Cool.

04:34.074 --> 04:36.575
Chance, I need a lot of
coverage from you, okay?
Yes, sir.

04:36.577 --> 04:38.310
Grant,
you're getting the pass.

04:38.312 --> 04:40.746
You give me the ingredients,
I'll cook the soup.

04:40.748 --> 04:42.881
Okay. Ready?
One, two, three.

04:42.883 --> 04:44.316
Z!
Z!

04:54.394 --> 04:56.395
Butt-chuggers!

04:56.397 --> 04:57.929
Watch 42. Watch 42.

04:57.931 --> 04:59.598
You're mine,
turd biscuit.

04:59.600 --> 05:00.666
Bogey, 20.

05:00.668 --> 05:03.001
Eye of the tiger, men,
thrill of the fight.

05:03.003 --> 05:04.803
Randy, read your keys.

05:04.805 --> 05:06.471
Set. Hut!

05:43.877 --> 05:48.280
Touchdown, Panthers.
Wow, Rosenfalis
held onto it!

05:48.282 --> 05:49.548
What a play!

05:50.450 --> 05:51.483
Yeah!

05:53.287 --> 05:55.053
Hold on.
Something's wrong, Bill.

05:55.055 --> 05:58.457
Rosenfalis is not moving.
He could be hurt.

05:58.459 --> 05:59.758
You hate to see this, Dan.

06:00.626 --> 06:02.361
Grant. Are you okay?

06:03.896 --> 06:05.764
I can't feel

06:06.733 --> 06:07.933
my penis.

06:08.968 --> 06:12.404
Somebody call a doctor!
What about your legs?

06:12.406 --> 06:16.007
Who cares? I can't
feel my balls. My boys.

06:16.009 --> 06:18.369
Get out of my way,
I'm a doctor.
I can't feel either of them.

06:18.878 --> 06:20.645
I'm a doctor.
All right.

06:20.647 --> 06:25.217
Now, son, tell me,
can you feel this?

06:26.152 --> 06:28.820
No. No.

06:28.822 --> 06:30.722
I can't feel anything.

06:30.724 --> 06:32.958
I'm sorry, he's been paralyzed
from the balls down.

06:33.926 --> 06:34.993
Sorry for your loss.

06:34.995 --> 06:38.397
Oh, God! What?
He's just leaving?

06:38.399 --> 06:39.698
All right, okay.
Oh, God.

06:39.700 --> 06:41.566
Stay with me, okay?

06:41.568 --> 06:43.402
Caleb, it's more
than just intramurals.

06:43.404 --> 06:46.104
It's more than a game.

06:46.106 --> 06:48.607
Promise me you
won't give up.

06:48.609 --> 06:50.075
What?
Promise me!

06:50.077 --> 06:51.410
I promise.

06:51.412 --> 06:52.677
Promise me.

06:52.679 --> 06:53.879
I just did.
No, I promise.

06:53.881 --> 06:55.747
Promise me...

07:45.164 --> 07:47.199
Here you go, fellas.

08:03.316 --> 08:04.583
Hey, Hank.

08:04.585 --> 08:07.986
Me and some of the guys
are playing football
in a minute. You down?

08:07.988 --> 08:09.087
Yeah, I can't.

08:09.089 --> 08:13.425
Look, I can't actually play
if I don't bring someone else.
They won't let me.

08:13.427 --> 08:15.760
And please don't make me go
to Home Depot and get
another day laborer.

08:15.762 --> 08:19.331
Last time I did that,
Enrique broke his ankle
and then he got deported.

08:19.333 --> 08:23.602
Well, I'm really sorry
to hear about Enrique,
but I gotta study.

08:23.604 --> 08:26.037
We're seniors, dude.
What do you
have to study for?

08:26.039 --> 08:29.941
We are fifth-year seniors.
And I gotta
study for the LSAT.

08:29.943 --> 08:31.776
Dude, I didn't know
you wanted to
be a urologist.

08:31.778 --> 08:34.279
Lawyer.
I wanna be a lawyer.

08:34.280 --> 08:35.947
Wait. Did that she-demon
put you up to this?

08:35.948 --> 08:37.182
Her name is Vicky.

08:37.183 --> 08:39.217
She's terrible.
Break up with her.

08:39.219 --> 08:41.119
Come on,
she's nice to me, man.

08:41.121 --> 08:42.220
She's got that look, man.

08:42.222 --> 08:43.288
What look?

08:43.289 --> 08:44.450
That look...

08:45.625 --> 08:48.894
Like she wants to
nail gun your nutsack

08:48.896 --> 08:50.462
to a concrete wall
of commitment.

08:50.464 --> 08:52.797
And you know,
one night,
you weren't here,

08:52.799 --> 08:55.467
but she spent an hour
describing her glitter art

08:55.469 --> 08:57.702
and how it was
inspired by 9/11.

08:57.704 --> 09:01.172
Okay.
You know what, go play your little game.

09:01.174 --> 09:03.241
Okay, I'm just gonna
have to pretend

09:03.243 --> 09:06.077
that you didn't
just call football,

09:06.079 --> 09:08.847
the sport that
built this nation,
a little game.

09:08.849 --> 09:10.382
And I will pretend
that I didn't find a copy

09:10.384 --> 09:11.816
of <i> Sisterhood of</i>
<i>the Traveling Pants</i>

09:11.818 --> 09:13.718
in your <i> Road House</i> DVD case.

09:14.854 --> 09:17.355
You have
the upper hand this time.

09:17.357 --> 09:19.658
Gotta get to Home Depot.

09:22.762 --> 09:27.032
West's Business Law.
You and me, forever.

09:27.034 --> 09:28.333
The bitch is here.

09:28.335 --> 09:29.601
Okay, Hank.

09:32.104 --> 09:34.906
Hi!

09:34.908 --> 09:38.243
Guess what I got for
<i>Dancing with the Stars</i>
tonight?

09:38.245 --> 09:39.578
Um...

09:39.580 --> 09:43.281
Peppermint Schnapps,
cottage cheese,
algae balls.

09:43.849 --> 09:44.950
Uh...

09:44.952 --> 09:47.385
Okay. Cool.

09:47.387 --> 09:49.020
What, are you
not gonna watch?

09:49.022 --> 09:51.423
No, I'm just,
well, studying.

09:51.425 --> 09:52.891
You know, take the LSAT.

09:52.893 --> 09:55.093
Oh, my God.
I'm so proud of you

09:55.095 --> 09:57.228
for finally committing
to it. Good job.

09:57.230 --> 09:59.698
Yeah, gotta...

09:59.700 --> 10:02.701
Oh, thanks.
Gotta have a career,
you know.

10:02.703 --> 10:04.102
Speaking of which,

10:04.104 --> 10:09.140
Father is throwing
me a birthday party
at the club tomorrow night.

10:09.142 --> 10:11.776
I thought he was
still in New York working.

10:11.778 --> 10:14.145
No, no. He got
the microwave company off.

10:14.147 --> 10:17.315
They don't owe
the children's
shelter anything.

10:17.750 --> 10:19.484
Wow.

10:19.486 --> 10:21.052
Uh, can't wait
to meet him.

10:21.921 --> 10:24.489
You know, if it goes well,

10:24.491 --> 10:26.558
I think that, probably,
he could put in

10:26.560 --> 10:28.460
a good word
for you at Harvard.

10:28.462 --> 10:30.929
Harvard?
Harvard.

10:30.931 --> 10:34.466
Wouldn't you want
to spend a few years
with me in Cambridge?

10:35.501 --> 10:38.937
That... That is an option,
isn't it, huh? Maybe?

10:38.939 --> 10:40.605
Yeah.

10:40.607 --> 10:42.741
You're such
a good boyfriend.

10:42.743 --> 10:43.808
Oh. Oh.

10:43.810 --> 10:45.243
If you wanna
take a study break,

10:45.245 --> 10:48.313
I TiVoed the new
gynecology reality show,
<i>Lip Service.</i>

10:49.248 --> 10:50.315
Wow.

10:50.983 --> 10:52.984
Fascinating stuff.

10:56.856 --> 10:59.491
Wow, I did not know
it would be this...

10:59.493 --> 11:02.694
<i>Elegant.</i>
I know, I'm dying.

11:02.696 --> 11:04.429
Daddy! That's Daddy.

11:04.431 --> 11:07.632
Daddy. Thank you for my party.

11:07.634 --> 11:09.668
Oh, my pleasure, honey.

11:09.670 --> 11:13.938
Oh, and this must be
the Callum I've been
hearing so much about.

11:13.940 --> 11:17.475
Caleb, sir.
Yep, but it is a pleasure
to be meeting you.

11:17.477 --> 11:21.479
I'm gonna BRB.
Uh, just network
or do whatever. Okay.

11:25.184 --> 11:27.052
So, I hear you
wanna be a lawyer.

11:27.054 --> 11:30.021
Well, I'm gonna
shoot straight
with you, Callum,

11:30.023 --> 11:31.489
because I am
a straight shooter.

11:31.491 --> 11:33.058
Now, Vicky tells me
you're a bright kid,

11:33.060 --> 11:36.127
but we turn away
a lot of bright kids
at my firm.

11:36.129 --> 11:39.664
We interviewed this
Eagle Scout last week.

11:39.666 --> 11:42.167
Beat cancer when he was 15.

11:42.169 --> 11:44.736
Started a non-profit
for cancer patients

11:44.738 --> 11:47.005
and raised over $6 million.

11:47.007 --> 11:49.374
Then went to Harvard
and scored a perfect GPA.

11:50.476 --> 11:53.945
We didn't give him an offer.
You wanna know why?

11:54.480 --> 11:55.513
Uh, why?

11:55.515 --> 11:58.016
He was ugly.
A really face-melter.

11:58.018 --> 11:59.651
I mean, I get sick
thinking about him.

11:59.653 --> 12:03.655
But you,
you're a good-looking kid.

12:03.657 --> 12:06.558
Bet I could bounce
a bouillon cube off your butt.

12:07.093 --> 12:08.560
Um, thank you.

12:08.562 --> 12:14.165
So, you get a 178
on your LSAT and maintain
at least a 3.8 GPA,

12:14.167 --> 12:18.670
then, in three years,
you can work for me.
Starting salary is $180K.

12:18.672 --> 12:20.038
Whoa. Heh heh.

12:20.040 --> 12:21.339
You look overwhelmed.

12:21.341 --> 12:25.076
Uh, no. No, sir.
Just, lot of ifs.

12:25.078 --> 12:29.380
So, buckle down.
Your job now is to make
sure your future is set.

12:29.382 --> 12:31.683
Well,
that shouldn't be too hard.

12:31.685 --> 12:35.386
<i>Thank you, everyone,
for coming to my party.</i>

12:35.388 --> 12:39.190
<i>Daddy, I know this is only
the fourth birthday of mine</i>

12:39.192 --> 12:41.092
<i>that you've been able
to physically attend,</i>

12:41.094 --> 12:42.927
<i>but I'm sure it's
gonna be a special one.</i>

12:42.929 --> 12:44.095
Love you, honey.

12:44.097 --> 12:46.297
<i>And I love you. Um...</i>

12:46.299 --> 12:48.700
<i>Okay. Speaking of special,</i>

12:48.702 --> 12:52.670
<i>there's also</i>
<i>a new man in my life</i>
<i>who's pretty special himself.</i>

12:53.873 --> 12:54.939
<i>Um...</i>

12:56.041 --> 12:57.442
Uh, Vicky,
we don't need to...

12:57.444 --> 12:59.144
<i>Okay.</i>

13:00.946 --> 13:02.213
<i>Caleb,</i>

13:03.215 --> 13:05.049
<i>the last
five-and-a-half months</i>

13:05.051 --> 13:07.118
<i>of our courtship
have been magical,</i>

13:07.120 --> 13:10.722
<i>and you're</i>
<i>clearly taking steps</i>
<i>to ensure our future</i>

13:10.724 --> 13:15.293
<i>and so, today on my birthday,
this day of days,</i>

13:15.896 --> 13:21.966
<i>will you bestow upon me</i>
<i>the greatest gift</i>
<i>that can be bestowed</i>

13:22.568 --> 13:24.836
<i>upon a woman, and that is,</i>

13:25.638 --> 13:28.139
Caleb Fuller,
will you marry me?

13:38.751 --> 13:39.918
<i>Caleb.</i>

13:39.920 --> 13:43.021
<i>Cold concrete
wall of commitment.</i>

13:46.258 --> 13:47.325
Caleb?

13:48.160 --> 13:49.594
Caleb?
Yeah?

13:49.596 --> 13:50.662
He said yes!

13:51.798 --> 13:53.331
Uh...

13:56.435 --> 13:59.971
Smart choice, kid.
You got a bright
future ahead of you.

14:16.155 --> 14:17.222
Heads up!

14:17.723 --> 14:19.257
Hey, sorry, man...

14:20.459 --> 14:22.560
Vinnie?
Caleb?

14:22.562 --> 14:25.196
Yo!
Ho ho! What's up?

14:25.198 --> 14:26.798
How you been?
It's been ages.

14:26.800 --> 14:29.167
Yeah, yeah, like four years.
How are you?

14:29.169 --> 14:31.536
I'm great, man, I'm great.
Never been better.

14:31.538 --> 14:33.004
Cool.
You about to graduate?

14:33.006 --> 14:35.240
Yeah. From college.

14:35.242 --> 14:36.641
Right. Yep.

14:36.643 --> 14:38.176
What about you?
How you been?

14:38.178 --> 14:41.145
I'm good, I'm good.
Just, you know,
studying for the LSAT.

14:41.147 --> 14:42.380
Gynecologist, nice.

14:43.082 --> 14:44.482
Lawyer.

14:44.484 --> 14:47.085
Wait a second.
I see you've been moonlighting
as a jewel thief.

14:47.087 --> 14:49.354
Oh, yeah. Got engaged.

14:49.356 --> 14:51.189
What?
Yeah.

14:51.191 --> 14:52.390
Congratulations.

14:53.325 --> 14:55.193
Yep.

14:55.195 --> 14:57.061
So, I see you're
still throwing.

14:57.063 --> 15:00.365
Ah, well, yeah,
I just throw the ball around
sometimes, you know.

15:00.367 --> 15:02.607
Cool, man, cool.
Who you throwing with?

15:02.668 --> 15:03.735
Nobody.

15:04.003 --> 15:05.069
Yeah.

15:07.072 --> 15:08.172
What?

15:08.174 --> 15:10.441
Yeah. Nobody.

15:10.443 --> 15:12.176
I just try to hit people,
you know,

15:12.178 --> 15:13.845
and just pretend
it was an accident.

15:13.847 --> 15:15.413
It's good, clean fun.

15:15.415 --> 15:16.948
Good, clean fun.

15:16.950 --> 15:19.918
Watch, watch, watch.
You see this guy?
Look at that asshole.

15:19.920 --> 15:21.152
Ready?

15:25.792 --> 15:26.925
Aim's a little off,

15:26.927 --> 15:29.460
but still got
a hell of an arm.
Thanks, bro.

15:29.462 --> 15:33.698
Anyway, you wanna go
throw a little bit?
Or, catch up or something?

15:33.700 --> 15:35.934
Sure. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

15:35.936 --> 15:38.416
I know a better place, though.
Yeah, sweet.

15:38.704 --> 15:40.204
Yo, a little ball help.

15:45.478 --> 15:46.978
Yes! Nailed it!

15:48.648 --> 15:49.781
Look at him.

15:50.749 --> 15:52.216
Who did this?

15:52.218 --> 15:53.818
Vinnie, when you said
you knew somewhere
better to throw,

15:53.820 --> 15:56.321
I thought you meant,
you know, where we could...

15:56.323 --> 15:57.989
Together.
Yeah.

15:57.991 --> 16:00.425
Got it. Right. Right, right.
Yeah, yeah, let's go.

16:01.728 --> 16:03.127
Ball help.

16:03.129 --> 16:06.831
Yeah, so,
after the team broke up
freshmen year,

16:06.833 --> 16:08.566
I started quarterbacking
for the Penguins,

16:08.568 --> 16:11.436
but they gave me the boot
after we lost six in a row.

16:11.438 --> 16:13.137
Ooh.
You still play?

16:13.405 --> 16:14.639
No.

16:14.641 --> 16:17.475
No, I kind of lost
interest after the...

16:17.477 --> 16:18.643
Yeah.

16:18.645 --> 16:20.244
Plus, school's intense.

16:20.246 --> 16:21.779
I understand, man,
I understand.

16:21.781 --> 16:23.581
You gotta get
serious about life
sometime, right?

16:23.583 --> 16:25.083
Yeah.

16:25.085 --> 16:26.918
You keep in contact
with any of the guys
from the old team?

16:26.920 --> 16:28.686
No.

16:28.688 --> 16:33.424
Although, I do think
I saw Grant get maced
on an episode of <i> Cops</i> once.

16:33.426 --> 16:34.826
Oh, do you remember
that time

16:34.828 --> 16:36.694
that Grant pissed in
George's water bottle

16:36.696 --> 16:38.162
and he told him
it was Gatorade?

16:38.164 --> 16:40.031
Yeah.

16:40.033 --> 16:41.366
No, no, no.
You remember the time

16:41.368 --> 16:42.633
that we pissed in
Jimmy's chicken soup,

16:42.635 --> 16:43.968
and we told him it
was chicken broth?

16:43.970 --> 16:46.938
Yes. Yes,
the look on his face, man.

16:50.809 --> 16:51.876
Awesome.

16:51.878 --> 16:55.546
Oh, man. Pissed on
a lot of stuff back then.

16:56.382 --> 16:58.516
Best year of college.

16:58.518 --> 17:00.351
Best year of my life, man.

17:06.058 --> 17:08.358
Hey, this might sound crazy,

17:09.694 --> 17:12.255
but what do you think
about getting the old team
back together?

17:14.566 --> 17:16.701
Oh, my goodness.
Are you okay?
Are you okay?

17:16.902 --> 17:18.336
Ooh.

17:18.338 --> 17:20.171
She's not moving.
She's not moving.

17:20.173 --> 17:22.040
We should relocate.

17:24.076 --> 17:25.977
She's not moving!

17:25.979 --> 17:28.378
Were you serious back there?
About getting
the old team back together?

17:28.381 --> 17:29.914
Uh, yeah, let's do it.

17:29.916 --> 17:31.315
What about Grant?

17:31.317 --> 17:32.717
I got just the guy.

17:33.819 --> 17:35.420
So you guys went to
the intramural championship

17:35.422 --> 17:36.821
your freshmen year?

17:36.823 --> 17:38.156
Yeah.

17:38.158 --> 17:39.490
What happened?

17:39.492 --> 17:41.559
We won.
On the last play.

17:41.827 --> 17:42.927
Wow.

17:42.929 --> 17:44.162
Okay.

17:44.164 --> 17:46.064
And now you wanna get
the band back together.

17:46.066 --> 17:49.033
The big issue is that
we lost all contact
with the guys.

17:49.035 --> 17:51.002
I mean,
I haven't seen Vinnie
since freshmen year.

17:51.004 --> 17:52.670
No, we don't know
where anybody lives

17:52.672 --> 17:54.338
or even if they're
still in school, so...

17:54.340 --> 17:55.873
But you remember
their names, right?

17:55.875 --> 18:01.045
Because the university
website gives you
current contact info

18:01.047 --> 18:03.614
for all registered students.

18:03.616 --> 18:06.050
That's how I stalk
all the hot freshmen girls.

18:06.052 --> 18:08.953
A little knock, knock,
"Welcome to class,"

18:08.955 --> 18:10.388
tap that ass.

18:10.390 --> 18:11.789
Nice.

18:11.791 --> 18:16.194
So, are you guys thinking
what I'm thinking?

18:16.196 --> 18:19.030
Yeah, that we should use
the university's website

18:19.032 --> 18:21.799
to get all the current
contact information
for all the guys.

18:21.801 --> 18:26.104
And attempt to
convince them to join
the intramural football team.

18:26.106 --> 18:29.707
Dude, you're not
supposed to answer
a rhetorical question.

18:32.411 --> 18:36.647
So, are you guys thinking
what I'm thinking.

18:41.720 --> 18:45.556
<i>Jimmy Harris.
Calm yet intense.</i>

18:45.558 --> 18:48.025
<i>Perfect under pressure
and a real-life cowboy.</i>

18:49.094 --> 18:50.561
Look out!

18:50.563 --> 18:52.830
Dude, what's he doing?
That horse is gonna kill him.

18:52.832 --> 18:54.732
She's out of control.

18:54.734 --> 18:56.234
Buttercup.

19:14.820 --> 19:15.987
Wow.

19:17.357 --> 19:22.326
<i>Good utility player</i>
<i>and an amazing</i>
<i>student of the game.</i>

19:23.662 --> 19:27.131
Oh, forgive the mess.
I'm working on my thesis.

19:27.133 --> 19:28.599
What is it?

19:28.601 --> 19:32.436
I'm currently trying to find
the number in
between three and four.

19:32.438 --> 19:34.438
Between three and four?
Yes.

19:34.440 --> 19:36.641
Haven't you just
ever had a gut feeling

19:36.643 --> 19:39.677
that there was a number
right in between
three and four?

19:39.679 --> 19:41.612
You mean, like Pi?
No!

19:41.614 --> 19:43.514
Not like Pi.

19:43.882 --> 19:44.949
Okay.

19:46.552 --> 19:50.621
<i>Chance Gilman.
The lone wolf wide receiver.</i>

19:50.623 --> 19:53.958
<i>We called him Magic Man</i>
<i>because he could</i>
<i>make magic on the field</i>

19:53.960 --> 19:56.127
<i>and he was a bit of
an amateur magician.</i>

19:56.129 --> 19:59.230
Now tell me.
Is this your card?

19:59.232 --> 20:01.032
How in the hell
did you do that?

20:01.034 --> 20:03.367
That's called
street magic, Rafa.

20:03.369 --> 20:05.069
You wouldn't <i> comprende.</i>

20:07.372 --> 20:09.073
I'll show you street magic.

20:09.075 --> 20:11.876
Go on. Go ahead.
Show me your magic.

20:11.878 --> 20:13.144
Show me your magic!

20:13.146 --> 20:15.079
Put the knife down, man.
Put the knife down.

20:15.081 --> 20:16.214
What knife?

20:17.649 --> 20:19.483
This white boy's crazy!

20:19.485 --> 20:22.553
And that's how you do
magic in the streets.

20:25.023 --> 20:26.891
<i>What about Grant?</i>

20:28.594 --> 20:30.261
<i>Leave that to me.</i>

20:37.370 --> 20:38.836
Hey, Grant.

20:41.006 --> 20:43.274
It's me, Caleb.

20:43.276 --> 20:45.009
I brought you
the <i> Rocky</i> Criterion Collection

20:45.011 --> 20:46.844
on laser disc, man.

20:48.180 --> 20:50.581
Purest of formats,
like you always said.

20:51.850 --> 20:56.254
Look, man,
I'm getting the old
team back together.

20:57.689 --> 20:58.756
Can't do it without you.

20:59.859 --> 21:02.693
Why don't you
check the cemetery?

21:02.695 --> 21:08.032
Grant Rosenfalis
has been dead for
the last four years.

21:08.034 --> 21:11.769
Leave a message
after the beep.

21:12.371 --> 21:13.738
Beep!

21:13.740 --> 21:15.072
I just wanna talk to you, bud.

21:15.074 --> 21:18.409
Beep...

21:18.411 --> 21:19.744
All right.

21:19.746 --> 21:21.579
Well...

21:21.581 --> 21:23.781
It's out here
if you want it.

21:26.552 --> 21:29.120
You took a breath in the beep.
I know it's your voice.

21:29.122 --> 21:30.921
If you'd like
to make a call,

21:30.923 --> 21:34.492
please hang up
and go blow yourself.

21:34.494 --> 21:37.295
<i>If these guys</i>
<i>are anything like</i>
<i>they were four years ago,</i>

21:37.297 --> 21:40.464
<i>they'll be chomping at the bit
to get the team back together.</i>

21:40.466 --> 21:42.900
...he's having a hard time!

21:42.902 --> 21:47.738
What makes you think after
four years, we should put
this team back together?

21:47.740 --> 21:50.241
Come on. You remember
all the fun times we had.

21:50.243 --> 21:52.576
Georgie, the night
that we whizzed on you
when you were sleeping?

21:52.578 --> 21:53.944
You guys pissed on me
while I was asleep?

21:53.946 --> 21:55.279
Yeah.

21:55.281 --> 21:57.415
You don't do that
to a friend, guys.

21:57.417 --> 22:00.184
I never understood
what was so cool about
pissing on everything.

22:00.186 --> 22:03.421
Look, we were all
a bunch of stupid punks
back then.

22:03.423 --> 22:05.956
It was fun,
but we're grown-ups now.

22:05.958 --> 22:09.060
Caleb. I got dresses. Ah!

22:11.163 --> 22:13.364
And you're having a party.

22:13.366 --> 22:16.100
Hey, babe.
Just hanging with the boys.

22:16.802 --> 22:19.003
Could I talk to you outside?

22:19.471 --> 22:20.604
Am I on crack,

22:20.606 --> 22:23.007
or are we supposed to be
planning our nuptials?

22:23.009 --> 22:24.108
Uh, yeah. No...

22:24.110 --> 22:25.343
How are we supposed to decide

22:25.345 --> 22:27.044
what flavor of
edible tanning solution

22:27.046 --> 22:28.646
your groomsmaids are gonna wear

22:28.648 --> 22:31.782
if you're hosting
a seance of freaks?

22:31.784 --> 22:33.784
It's football.

22:35.120 --> 22:37.555
Babe, I need this.

22:37.557 --> 22:39.323
You need?
What do you mean, you need?

22:39.325 --> 22:40.991
You don't need it.
What do you mean?

22:40.993 --> 22:42.126
No, like...

22:42.128 --> 22:44.628
Do you understand
the pressure that I am under?

22:44.630 --> 22:46.731
What's all this?
What's going on?
This goddamn wedding. I'm...

22:46.733 --> 22:48.065
Why are you shaking?
There's just too much to do

22:48.067 --> 22:49.166
and it's making me...

22:49.168 --> 22:50.301
I can't stop shaking.

22:50.303 --> 22:52.636
You're just moving
your hands, honey.
Come on.

22:52.638 --> 22:54.538
I can't stop.

22:54.540 --> 22:57.308
Babe, I need a release.

22:57.310 --> 22:58.476
You know...
From the studying...

22:58.478 --> 22:59.643
Okay.

22:59.645 --> 23:01.979
And then you and me
on the same page again.

23:01.981 --> 23:03.547
Yeah? Okay.
Okay.

23:03.549 --> 23:06.417
But do you promise it won't
get in the way of us, please?

23:06.419 --> 23:08.519
Yes. Yes, I do. I do.

23:08.521 --> 23:10.354
Oh!

23:10.356 --> 23:11.922
You better get
used to saying that.

23:11.924 --> 23:13.324
Braid my hair.

23:13.326 --> 23:15.092
Oh,
I'll braid your hair before
I break your face, bro.

23:15.094 --> 23:16.594
Oh, horse whisperer's
got some spunk, huh?

23:16.596 --> 23:18.028
You wanna go
eight seconds with me?

23:18.030 --> 23:19.330
I only need six.

23:19.332 --> 23:20.664
Hey! Hey! Hey!

23:20.666 --> 23:23.200
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Desperados, slow it down.

23:23.202 --> 23:25.703
Springsteen,
what is the deal?

23:25.705 --> 23:27.872
Loosen the bandana, Hank.

23:27.874 --> 23:29.240
Look, I don't know
about you guys,

23:29.242 --> 23:31.842
but I got one
semester left, okay?

23:31.844 --> 23:35.679
And then it is
off to law school
and the rest of my life.

23:35.681 --> 23:37.047
Which I'm so happy about.

23:37.049 --> 23:38.349
Yes.

23:40.185 --> 23:41.552
Look, this might be
our last shot

23:41.554 --> 23:43.287
at doing something
that doesn't matter.

23:43.289 --> 23:45.122
Okay? For the hell of it.

23:45.124 --> 23:49.360
Now I've already signed us up.
We got a game Thursday.

23:49.362 --> 23:52.630
You show up
and we see if the old
spark is there, huh?

23:52.632 --> 23:55.466
And if not,
you go your separate ways.

23:55.934 --> 23:57.501
Okay? Who's in?

23:59.138 --> 24:02.706
Here we go, boys! Down!

24:02.708 --> 24:06.877
Spank it and shake it!
That's a hand in
the cookie jar!

24:06.879 --> 24:09.380
Blue, 42. Set, hut.

24:13.718 --> 24:15.719
Jesus, Randy.

24:15.721 --> 24:19.490
Come here.
Come here, Randy.
Come here.

24:19.492 --> 24:21.926
Hey. Why did you
just drop that pass?

24:21.928 --> 24:26.230
You just thought you'd ruin
a perfectly good throw?

24:26.232 --> 24:29.600
Or maybe you thought
you'd imitate the drummer
from Def Leppard?

24:29.602 --> 24:31.001
I don't get that reference.

24:32.905 --> 24:35.105
Yeah, well,
maybe you'll just
run wind sprints

24:35.107 --> 24:36.507
until your feet bleed.

24:36.509 --> 24:37.808
Yeah, I like
the sound of that.

24:37.810 --> 24:40.277
Come on, buddy, hop to.
Let's go!

24:40.279 --> 24:41.745
Dick?
What, Ace?

24:41.747 --> 24:43.147
Can't you see I'm
enacting tough love?

24:43.149 --> 24:47.585
I just wanted to let you know,
Caleb Fuller signed
up for the leagues.

24:47.587 --> 24:52.089
From the Panthers.
The only team
that ever beat us.

24:52.758 --> 24:57.695
Yeah,
his best friend Grant was
awesomely paralyzed by you

24:57.697 --> 24:58.829
in the game-winning play.

24:58.831 --> 25:01.599
I'm having a tough time here.
I don't... Fuller?

25:01.601 --> 25:03.601
I brought
a series of photographs.

25:04.302 --> 25:06.270
It's Caleb Fuller.

25:06.272 --> 25:09.139
Look at that smile,
five miles wide.

25:09.141 --> 25:12.109
Hold on.
There's a few more in here.
I got a...

25:13.212 --> 25:15.713
Yeah. I know who he is!

25:15.715 --> 25:18.983
I was just pretending
not to so it seemed
like I didn't care.

25:18.985 --> 25:21.145
Who's their
first game against?

25:30.295 --> 25:31.862
Perfect.

25:33.832 --> 25:35.299
What does it say?

25:47.647 --> 25:52.316
<i>Opening night.</i>
<i>The grass is green,</i>
<i>the moon is out.</i>

25:52.318 --> 25:54.485
<i>I'm blitzed out of my skull</i>
<i>and ready to watch</i>
<i>the first game of</i>

25:54.487 --> 25:57.922
what promises to be
a very exciting
intramural season.

25:57.924 --> 26:01.659
I'm joined, as always,
by my cohort, Dan.
Dan, how's it hanging?

26:01.661 --> 26:04.361
Glad to be here
after my arrest for
possession last week.

26:04.363 --> 26:05.429
How'd your
step-dad take it?

26:05.431 --> 26:07.364
Let's just say we
had to hire a plumber

26:07.366 --> 26:09.233
to get the bricks
out of the toilet.

26:09.235 --> 26:11.168
Always good
with the metaphors.

26:11.170 --> 26:14.004
Metaphors, similes,
haikus, limericks.

26:14.006 --> 26:17.675
He plays
the English language
like a fine guitar.

26:17.677 --> 26:19.243
Where's Caleb?

26:19.844 --> 26:22.346
Don't worry, he'll show.

26:22.348 --> 26:24.915
That's not what
I'm worried about.

26:26.785 --> 26:29.587
The team to beat
this season, the Titans.

26:29.589 --> 26:33.023
Made up of
the fifth-year seniors
from the Who-Cares fraternity,

26:33.025 --> 26:35.693
the Titans had been favorited
to go all the way,

26:35.695 --> 26:36.794
thanks to Dick Downs.

26:36.796 --> 26:38.028
It's just nice to know that

26:38.030 --> 26:40.197
despite their good looks
and established wealth,

26:40.199 --> 26:42.967
they're all
likely to suffer from
alcoholism and depression

26:42.969 --> 26:45.369
some 20 years from now.

26:45.371 --> 26:47.571
I want you to
rip off their heads

26:47.573 --> 26:49.907
and shit down
their spinal cavity.

26:49.909 --> 26:50.975
Aah!

26:53.044 --> 26:54.478
Where the hell is Caleb?

27:05.223 --> 27:08.592
Hey, you!
You're parked in
the handicap zone.

27:12.797 --> 27:14.465
Hi. You-hoo.

27:15.166 --> 27:17.067
Hi.
Hi.

27:17.069 --> 27:20.404
You're in the handicap.
Your car.

27:20.406 --> 27:24.775
You know what? It's okay.
My best friend used
to be paralyzed, so...

27:24.777 --> 27:26.777
What?

27:26.779 --> 27:29.279
He didn't used
to be paralyzed,
he used to be my best friend.

27:29.281 --> 27:30.814
Oh, okay.

27:30.816 --> 27:31.915
But I haven't
spoken to him in a while,

27:31.917 --> 27:34.918
but he is still paralyzed,
so thank goodness.

27:34.920 --> 27:35.986
Uh...

27:36.488 --> 27:38.322
That doesn't go away.

27:38.324 --> 27:39.456
Sorry, I guess.

27:39.458 --> 27:41.091
That's okay.

27:41.093 --> 27:44.795
Your shirt, that kind
of reminds me of him.
<i>Eye of the Tiger</i> fan.

27:44.797 --> 27:48.699
It kind of
reminds me of <i> Rocky III.</i>
Best movie of all time.

27:48.701 --> 27:50.334
I think you mean <i> Rocky I.</i>

27:50.969 --> 27:52.269
What? Come on.
Yeah.

27:52.271 --> 27:54.204
No, he doesn't
even win in the end.

27:54.206 --> 27:58.942
It's not about the winning.
No, no, come on.
That's where he meets Adrian.

27:58.944 --> 28:01.045
Yeah.
Oh. Interesting.

28:01.047 --> 28:03.213
Mer-Bear,
did you bring my juice boxes?

28:03.215 --> 28:04.615
Hi.

28:04.617 --> 28:07.785
Well, well, well.
The prodigal pussy returns.

28:07.787 --> 28:09.053
Hey!
What?

28:09.055 --> 28:10.421
It's good to see you, Dick.

28:11.289 --> 28:12.356
Still doing that.

28:12.358 --> 28:14.191
Riddle me, riddle me,
riddle me this.

28:14.193 --> 28:17.961
A man with no fear,
or a man with nothing to lose?

28:18.963 --> 28:20.798
What about a man who's
not afraid of losing?

28:21.800 --> 28:23.133
But I...

28:23.135 --> 28:25.369
Look! Just get ready
to feel the pain.

28:25.371 --> 28:26.804
Okay. Got it.

28:26.806 --> 28:27.905
I'm gonna need
a juice box ready

28:27.907 --> 28:29.707
when I'm done taking
sexual advantage of that guy

28:29.709 --> 28:30.874
for four quarters.

28:30.876 --> 28:32.009
Okay.

28:32.011 --> 28:34.311
Dick, stop it.
What?

28:34.313 --> 28:35.746
I said, stop.

28:36.581 --> 28:38.882
I'm sorry.
Okay.

28:38.884 --> 28:41.719
I'm gonna rip out
your colon and use it
as a spooky eye-patch.

28:42.887 --> 28:44.021
I'll see you on the field,
Fuller.

28:44.023 --> 28:45.089
Okay...

28:49.027 --> 28:50.427
Wow. So...

28:50.429 --> 28:51.862
He's a good one.

28:51.864 --> 28:53.197
Mer-Bear.

28:53.199 --> 28:54.364
Heh.

28:54.366 --> 28:56.333
Just Meredith.
Okay.

28:57.335 --> 28:58.602
Is that, uh...

28:59.738 --> 29:01.138
Is that your boyfriend?

29:02.373 --> 29:06.744
No, no, no.
No. Gross. No, that's...

29:06.746 --> 29:08.112
Sorry, he's my brother.

29:08.114 --> 29:09.680
Oh, okay.

29:09.682 --> 29:11.515
That's my twin brother.
Oh.

29:11.517 --> 29:12.916
Yeah, I know.

29:12.918 --> 29:15.219
Okay. I'm gonna get going.

29:15.221 --> 29:16.353
Okay.

29:16.355 --> 29:18.989
It was lovely to
meet you, just Meredith.

29:19.958 --> 29:21.959
A handshake?
Yeah.

29:21.961 --> 29:25.596
You can't offer me
a handshake before a game.

29:26.231 --> 29:27.364
Uh, all right.

29:27.366 --> 29:28.632
You gotta get amped up.

29:28.634 --> 29:33.070
Come on, give me a high five
or a chest bump or something.

29:33.072 --> 29:34.805
Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
No, yeah.

29:34.807 --> 29:36.273
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
I'll give you
a little high five.

29:36.275 --> 29:37.875
Okay.
Cool with that.

29:37.877 --> 29:40.210
We'll do a little
chest bumping later.
Okay.

29:40.212 --> 29:41.912
What?

29:41.914 --> 29:44.548
No, we'll just...

29:45.383 --> 29:47.050
All right.

29:47.052 --> 29:48.952
See you later.
Got it.

29:50.588 --> 29:52.289
I just... Nope.

29:54.826 --> 29:58.662
Are my eyes deceiving me?
I think that's Caleb Fuller
and the Panthers,

29:58.664 --> 30:00.931
a team that won
the intramural crown
four years ago,

30:00.933 --> 30:02.232
but disbanded soon after

30:02.234 --> 30:05.235
their star receiver
was paralyzed
from the dong on down.

30:05.237 --> 30:08.005
We haven't seen these guys
since we were
second-year seniors.

30:08.007 --> 30:11.008
One wonders if they will
be able to recapture
the magic they once had.

30:11.010 --> 30:12.409
We'll find out
soon enough, Bill.

30:12.411 --> 30:15.012
But from the looks of things,
we gonna see
a beating so severe

30:15.014 --> 30:17.581
that it would make
Uday Hussein
look like a Quaker.

30:17.583 --> 30:20.150
And he, my friend,
was no Quaker.

30:21.920 --> 30:23.987
Hey, man,
you're pretty strong, huh?

30:23.989 --> 30:25.956
How much do you bench,
dude-bro?

30:25.958 --> 30:28.392
Ready! Down.

30:28.927 --> 30:30.561
Set. Hut.

30:32.664 --> 30:34.331
Aah!

30:35.099 --> 30:37.267
405, dude-bro.

30:41.105 --> 30:42.606
Jesus.

30:53.151 --> 30:56.671
Chance, Hank.
Check the ball.
Check the ball.

31:14.472 --> 31:16.673
Whoa, call the Panthers
Houdini's Shittier Brother,

31:16.675 --> 31:19.076
'cause they definitely
do not have the magic.

31:19.078 --> 31:21.645
No, these panthers
look like pussies.

31:25.049 --> 31:28.151
That was the lamest
excuse for football
I've ever seen.

31:28.153 --> 31:29.887
Yo! Wasn't that bad.

31:29.889 --> 31:31.388
Wasn't that bad?

31:31.390 --> 31:33.824
Dude, they scored
my grandpa's age.

31:33.826 --> 31:36.693
Um, you sucked just
as bad as we did.

31:36.695 --> 31:38.996
Whatever, Magic Mike.

31:38.998 --> 31:41.999
That movie has
nothing to do with magic!

31:42.001 --> 31:44.501
Hey, Siegfried,
why don't you go jack off
one of your tigers?

31:44.503 --> 31:46.203
Hey, leave him alone,
Friend-o.

31:46.205 --> 31:47.838
Yeah, who put
you in charge, Hank?

31:47.840 --> 31:51.241
It's clear that
I'm the only one here
with functioning testicles.

31:51.243 --> 31:52.676
Yeah? How'd you like
them not to function?

31:52.678 --> 31:56.246
Whoa, whoa! Calm down.
Everybody calm down.

31:56.248 --> 31:59.116
It was a rough start.
We're gonna get better.

32:00.718 --> 32:03.253
We're gonna get better,
right, Caleb?

32:04.355 --> 32:07.624
Yeah, I don't know.
Just didn't feel right.

32:08.092 --> 32:09.927
Yeah.

32:09.929 --> 32:12.229
Didn't feel right
having your asses
handed to you.

32:12.231 --> 32:14.631
Look, I understand
being a little bit rusty.

32:14.633 --> 32:16.300
'Cause I was celibate
for three months once.

32:16.302 --> 32:20.470
And when I got
back into the game,
I couldn't get erect again.

32:20.472 --> 32:21.738
I can't even
begin to imagine

32:21.740 --> 32:24.041
how you guys
were ever that good
in the first place.

32:24.043 --> 32:27.878
They were good
because they played
with their hearts.

32:27.880 --> 32:32.215
The Panthers I used to know
would take a beating like that

32:32.217 --> 32:37.220
and come back with
the fury of a raging typhoon.

32:37.222 --> 32:42.426
Those players
would calmly stare down
the dark lord of death

32:42.428 --> 32:46.563
and nut-tap him like
he was a cheap
Mexican birthday clown.

32:46.565 --> 32:49.800
They wouldn't
sit there and cry

32:49.802 --> 32:54.404
like a group of schoolgirls
that didn't get
to feed the geese.

32:54.406 --> 32:57.474
The men that I
once called friends

32:57.476 --> 33:01.778
would do the only thing
they knew how to do.

33:01.780 --> 33:04.047
Stand up and fight.

33:06.250 --> 33:08.552
Okay, I'm sorry.
Who the hell are you?

33:10.989 --> 33:14.124
My name is Grant Rosenfalis,
and I'm your new head coach.

33:18.262 --> 33:22.499
There is a classic structure
to all underdog sports movies.

33:22.934 --> 33:24.868
<i>Rocky, Hoosiers,</i>

33:24.870 --> 33:28.271
<i>Air Buds 1, 2, 3</i> and <i> 5.</i>

33:28.273 --> 33:29.339
What about <i> Air Bud 4?</i>

33:29.341 --> 33:32.509
A dog playing baseball?
Are you insane?

33:33.277 --> 33:34.611
It was stupid.

33:34.613 --> 33:36.680
Now, just like
in these films,

33:36.682 --> 33:40.617
you lot are a ragtag team
of varied archetypes.

33:40.619 --> 33:45.155
Currently zeroes,
though potentially heroes.

33:45.157 --> 33:47.991
But only with
the help of me,

33:47.993 --> 33:50.293
the crusty,
yet affable veteran

33:50.295 --> 33:52.963
reluctant to revisit
his troubled past.

33:52.965 --> 33:54.564
You're like
the exact same age as us.

33:54.566 --> 33:57.467
Eight thousand wind sprints
for the boy with Asperger's.

33:59.171 --> 34:00.537
All right.

34:03.408 --> 34:07.577
Okay. Grant,
what do we do?

34:10.313 --> 34:12.149
We train.

34:26.697 --> 34:28.697
Damn! It's too slow.

34:28.699 --> 34:33.904
I'll be employing
some unorthodox
training methods.

34:33.906 --> 34:37.007
<i>You'll be like
clay in my hands.</i>

34:37.507 --> 34:38.775
Resistant at first...

34:38.777 --> 34:40.510
Why are we
training on the beach?

34:40.512 --> 34:42.179
Because it's inspirational.

34:42.181 --> 34:45.916
But over time,
malleable to my touch.

34:47.685 --> 34:52.621
Athletic ability is not
the only skill to be honed.

34:52.623 --> 34:55.926
There must be
interpersonal conflict.

34:55.928 --> 34:57.360
Nice hooves out there,
Buttercup.

34:57.362 --> 34:58.528
Shut the hell up.

34:58.530 --> 35:00.464
There must be anger.

35:00.466 --> 35:01.598
Ooh!

35:01.600 --> 35:02.966
I hate you so much, Grant.

35:02.968 --> 35:04.034
And passion.

35:04.036 --> 35:05.802
Yeah!

35:05.804 --> 35:09.973
Some of my methods might
be deemed controversial.

35:09.975 --> 35:11.041
You guys sure about this?

35:11.043 --> 35:13.310
Football is war, gentlemen.

35:13.312 --> 35:16.546
And in war,
sometimes you get
shot with a gun.

35:16.548 --> 35:18.081
Okay.

35:18.083 --> 35:20.717
I can do it. I can do it.
I'm not gonna back out.

35:24.423 --> 35:26.323
Why didn't you
shoot him in the vest?

35:26.325 --> 35:27.924
You didn't tell me to.

35:27.926 --> 35:30.660
It seemed pretty
self-explanatory.

35:32.598 --> 35:34.431
Oh, God!
We gotta get
the hell out of here.

35:34.433 --> 35:36.566
What did you do?

35:36.568 --> 35:38.735
To lend a sense of gravity

35:38.737 --> 35:42.105
<i>to the otherwise
shallow athletic scenarios,</i>

35:42.107 --> 35:45.142
we'll need racial tension.

35:46.744 --> 35:50.224
<i>Then, you'll learn</i>
<i>to accept the freak</i>
<i>for who he is.</i>

35:50.615 --> 35:52.149
Hey, freak show.

35:52.583 --> 35:54.184
Nice catch.

35:54.186 --> 35:56.853
<i>Creepy and special.</i>

35:58.089 --> 36:01.491
Moments of levity
should be found

36:01.493 --> 36:04.161
<i>amongst the rigors of training.</i>

36:08.432 --> 36:09.599
It was human piss.

36:09.601 --> 36:13.270
And slowly but surely,
I'll begin to lighten up,

36:13.272 --> 36:15.138
and you'll see that

36:15.140 --> 36:19.109
this rough-around-the-edges
persona is merely skin-deep.

36:25.483 --> 36:27.450
<i>It didn't hurt.</i>

36:27.452 --> 36:29.019
<i>Everybody laugh.</i>

36:33.791 --> 36:35.792
'Cause I'm paralyzed.

36:35.794 --> 36:38.161
And as the music escalates,

36:38.163 --> 36:41.064
you begin to
improve dramatically.

37:05.890 --> 37:08.191
Finally,
the training culminates

37:08.193 --> 37:12.262
in an epic, slow-motion
shot of celebration.

37:35.721 --> 37:37.520
So I actually didn't know
what wind sprints were,

37:37.522 --> 37:39.762
so I just grabbed
a quick little snack.

37:40.524 --> 37:42.692
What, did I miss something?

37:48.366 --> 37:50.000
No peeking.

37:52.703 --> 37:53.870
Isn't that amazing.

37:53.872 --> 37:58.308
It's made of
only soy, spirulina
and fermented radishes.

37:58.310 --> 38:01.878
Uh-huh. Yeah,
swear I could've gotten
some rat feces in there.

38:01.880 --> 38:04.214
God, I think this
is our wedding cake.

38:04.216 --> 38:07.717
You know,
like, when you're little
and you think of your cake,

38:07.719 --> 38:09.486
and then you taste
it and you're like,

38:10.221 --> 38:11.388
"Aah, it's my cake"?

38:11.390 --> 38:12.555
Yeah?

38:12.557 --> 38:14.424
Oh, my God, don't you
have to go to LSAT class?

38:14.426 --> 38:18.361
Uh, yeah, you know what?
I'm just gonna
skip this one, so...

38:18.896 --> 38:20.630
Why?

38:20.632 --> 38:23.133
We got a game.
But you should come.

38:23.135 --> 38:26.903
Well, see, my dress weaver is
getting in from Milan tonight

38:26.905 --> 38:28.672
and we're going to
a Peruvian sweat lodge

38:28.674 --> 38:30.407
to start brainstorming
color schemes.

38:30.409 --> 38:33.943
But also,
why are you skipping class?

38:33.945 --> 38:35.645
It's just one class.

38:35.647 --> 38:36.846
Hmm.

38:36.848 --> 38:40.750
Well, it's just one class,
and then it's two classes,

38:40.752 --> 38:44.854
and then it's like
you're cheating on me
with my second cousin, Maevid.

38:44.856 --> 38:45.922
Maevid?

38:45.924 --> 38:47.991
This is our future.

38:49.660 --> 38:52.762
Okay. Yeah, I'll just...
I'll skip the game.

38:52.764 --> 38:54.764
I'll skip the game. Okay?

38:54.766 --> 38:56.099
Good. Better.

38:56.101 --> 38:57.901
All right.
I love you.

38:58.970 --> 39:00.970
For you.
I love you, I love you...

39:00.972 --> 39:03.206
I love me-you. Yeah.
Loving me, me, me.

39:03.208 --> 39:05.175
Mwah. Okay.

39:05.177 --> 39:07.610
You taste like the cake.

39:17.154 --> 39:18.388
Desolation!

39:18.390 --> 39:20.790
Shield, shield, shield, shield.

39:27.665 --> 39:28.965
You storming the castle?

39:33.304 --> 39:34.337
Hey, you.

39:34.339 --> 39:35.638
What's up?

39:36.707 --> 39:38.241
Where are you off to?

39:38.243 --> 39:39.809
I got an LSAT prep course.

39:39.811 --> 39:41.044
What are you doing?

39:41.046 --> 39:42.312
I'm, uh...

39:42.314 --> 39:43.980
I'm assistant manager

39:43.982 --> 39:46.349
of extracurricular activities.

39:46.351 --> 39:47.917
Oh, so you graduated.

39:47.919 --> 39:48.985
I did.

39:48.987 --> 39:50.420
Four years straight through,

39:50.422 --> 39:52.889
start to finish,
you're out.

39:52.891 --> 39:55.658
Gene, that's
a level-six
sorcery violation.

39:55.660 --> 39:57.827
One more, and I'll abscond
your dwarf rubies.

39:57.829 --> 39:59.929
My humblest apologies,
fair maiden.

39:59.931 --> 40:01.231
Carry on.

40:03.834 --> 40:05.668
Oh, you rule
with an iron fist.

40:05.670 --> 40:07.837
Whew. Just gotta...

40:07.839 --> 40:10.006
Yeah. I wanted to ask you

40:10.008 --> 40:12.876
what was it like
sharing a uterus
with Dick Downs?

40:12.878 --> 40:15.011
My brother's an ass
sometimes, I know.

40:15.013 --> 40:16.679
Yeah, what's the deal
with that?

40:16.681 --> 40:19.582
He had this huge
football scholarship,
and he lost it.

40:19.584 --> 40:20.850
Oh, what happened?

40:20.852 --> 40:22.352
Got in a car accident.

40:22.354 --> 40:23.887
Oh, my God, that sucks.

40:23.889 --> 40:25.889
Yeah, but it was his fault.

40:25.891 --> 40:29.058
He's a moron, but he's
my brother, so...

40:29.060 --> 40:31.027
Yeah, anyway, um,

40:31.029 --> 40:32.595
you should come
to our game tonight.

40:32.597 --> 40:34.597
I thought you had
your prep course.

40:34.599 --> 40:35.899
Yeah, you know what?

40:35.901 --> 40:38.201
Now I'm thinking
I might skip this one.

40:38.203 --> 40:39.869
Oh, okay. Uh,

40:39.871 --> 40:42.539
you might need
to convince me.

40:42.541 --> 40:44.874
Um, I really think
you should come.

40:44.876 --> 40:46.776
You're gonna see
a different team.

40:46.778 --> 40:47.977
Oh, come on.

40:47.979 --> 40:50.079
You can convince me
better than that.

40:50.081 --> 40:52.949
Be manly, like Rocky.

40:52.951 --> 40:54.417
Oh, oh, oh, oh.
Yeah. Yeah.

40:54.419 --> 40:55.485
I see.
Let's go there.

40:55.487 --> 40:56.586
That kind of... Okay.

40:56.588 --> 40:57.887
How about, um,

40:57.889 --> 40:59.088
Y-YO,

40:59.090 --> 41:01.257
you should totally
come to our game,

41:01.259 --> 41:02.559
yo, seriously.

41:02.561 --> 41:05.895
We're gonna pound
their skulls like
it's raw meat.

41:05.897 --> 41:07.797
Stop, or my mom
will shoot.

41:07.799 --> 41:09.566
Adrian!

41:12.003 --> 41:13.403
God, that was,
uh, yeah, no...

41:13.405 --> 41:14.737
I got a little
carried away there.
Was that good?

41:14.739 --> 41:16.806
That was actually
surprisingly good.

41:16.808 --> 41:18.174
Ah, thank you.

41:18.176 --> 41:19.509
So you'll come?

41:19.511 --> 41:21.778
GENE!

41:21.780 --> 41:23.480
No more quickening
potions for you.

41:23.482 --> 41:25.148
What? That's not fair.
I didn't do anything.

41:25.150 --> 41:26.583
Like hell, you didn't.

41:26.585 --> 41:27.917
We both saw you, Gene.

41:27.919 --> 41:29.986
Listen, I, uh...
Gene.

41:29.988 --> 41:31.688
I'll see you.
Okay.

41:31.690 --> 41:32.822
I'll see you.

41:32.824 --> 41:34.491
I'll see you tonight.
Okay.

41:34.493 --> 41:35.792
All right.
Good luck.

41:35.794 --> 41:37.060
Well, thank you.

41:44.301 --> 41:46.803
And in a drastic
turn of events,

41:46.805 --> 41:49.272
the Panthers
are neck and neck
with the Oilers.

41:49.274 --> 41:51.274
This is not the same team
we've seen out there.

41:51.276 --> 41:54.043
It's almost as if
Coach Grant Rosenfalis

41:54.045 --> 41:55.945
has turned the team around

41:55.947 --> 41:56.980
with his odd,
yet winning mixture

41:56.982 --> 41:58.781
of been there,
done that attitude

41:58.783 --> 42:00.283
and eclectic training devices.

42:00.285 --> 42:02.852
It's a potent combination
that never fails.

42:02.854 --> 42:03.953
No, sir.

42:03.955 --> 42:06.556
Almost as potent as this.
Ready!

42:06.558 --> 42:09.158
Down! Niney!

42:09.160 --> 42:10.320
Set. Hut.

42:15.165 --> 42:17.367
YEAH!

42:18.670 --> 42:20.904
Dude!
You call that defense?

42:20.906 --> 42:22.672
Back off.

42:22.674 --> 42:24.541
Taking a T, T-time.

42:24.543 --> 42:25.875
Caleb, come to "T."

42:25.877 --> 42:26.976
Come on.

42:26.978 --> 42:28.378
All right.

42:28.380 --> 42:30.113
What's the play?

42:31.315 --> 42:32.649
Triple Z.

42:32.651 --> 42:34.384
What?

42:35.853 --> 42:38.213
Grant, that's
the play that...

42:38.489 --> 42:40.924
I can't.
You must.

42:40.926 --> 42:43.192
You want to lead this team?
Listen to me.

42:43.194 --> 42:45.428
You're on a dinner date
with fate right now,

42:45.430 --> 42:47.063
and she keeps
touching your shoulder.

42:47.065 --> 42:49.232
Quit ordering desserts
and take her home.

42:54.405 --> 42:55.772
So what's the call?

42:55.774 --> 42:57.607
Caleb.

42:57.609 --> 42:59.175
What's the call?

43:00.344 --> 43:01.578
Triple Z.

43:01.580 --> 43:04.414
What? We haven't done that
play since freshman year.

43:04.416 --> 43:06.349
Vinnie, I need
a great head fake from you.

43:06.351 --> 43:07.917
Yeah.
Chance,
you're getting the catch.

43:07.919 --> 43:09.686
Everyone else,
you know what to do.

43:09.688 --> 43:12.188
I have actually
no idea what you're
talking about.

43:12.190 --> 43:14.757
Hank, you go
out there, and you be
a distraction, okay?

43:14.759 --> 43:15.959
On one. On one.

43:15.961 --> 43:17.460
- Ready?
- Break!

43:17.462 --> 43:18.595
Last play.

43:18.597 --> 43:20.477
Let's see if the Panthers
can make some magic.

43:21.699 --> 43:23.866
Ready.

43:23.868 --> 43:24.968
Down.

43:24.970 --> 43:26.703
Set.

43:26.705 --> 43:28.705
Whoo! Look at me!

43:28.707 --> 43:29.973
I'm beautiful!

43:29.975 --> 43:32.375
Yeah, I'm
the prettiest boy
in class.

43:32.377 --> 43:33.876
Hut!

43:52.062 --> 43:54.564
Throw the ball!

43:58.736 --> 44:00.003
Fuller's gonna run it.

44:00.005 --> 44:02.772
He's at the 40,
the 30, the 20.

44:02.774 --> 44:04.774
He could go all the way.

44:04.776 --> 44:06.309
Fuller for the touchdown.

44:06.311 --> 44:08.077
Despite having
a wide-open man,

44:08.079 --> 44:10.246
Caleb Fuller
decides to run it in.

44:10.248 --> 44:12.849
And just like that,
the Panthers are
back in business.

44:12.851 --> 44:14.083
Whoo!

44:14.085 --> 44:15.284
What's up? Yeah!

44:15.286 --> 44:16.419
Yeah, man!

44:16.421 --> 44:17.620
Yeah!
Whoo!

44:17.622 --> 44:19.689
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

44:19.691 --> 44:22.492
Whoo! Whoo!

44:30.367 --> 44:32.769
Yo, good game
tonight, guys.
Way to go.

44:32.771 --> 44:33.836
Yeah.
Man, you killed it.

44:33.838 --> 44:35.038
Good job, man.
Do it like that.

44:35.040 --> 44:36.172
Yeah, yeah.

44:36.174 --> 44:37.507
You did great.
Good night, man.

44:37.509 --> 44:39.442
We won the flag football
game because of you.

44:39.444 --> 44:40.510
Good.
Yeah.

44:40.512 --> 44:42.111
Hank, I'll see you
at home.

44:42.113 --> 44:45.014
All right. Don't wait up.
There's a freshman thing
I'm gonna go check out.

44:45.016 --> 44:46.282
Right. Okay.

44:49.954 --> 44:51.854
Hi, Chance.

44:51.856 --> 44:54.957
I just wanted to say
thanks for putting
the team back together.

44:54.959 --> 44:57.126
Yeah, totally.
I really needed this.

44:57.128 --> 44:58.461
Yeah, yeah,
me, too, man.

44:58.463 --> 45:00.463
My parents don't
respect my magic.

45:00.465 --> 45:02.298
My dad won't
look me in the eye.

45:02.300 --> 45:03.900
My mom keeps
forwarding me emails

45:03.902 --> 45:06.803
about how magic's
for nerds and losers.

45:06.805 --> 45:09.405
They think
I should be a doctor.

45:09.407 --> 45:11.507
Do you want
to be a doctor?

45:11.509 --> 45:13.376
I'd rather have
an asp-tongued demon

45:13.378 --> 45:16.412
impale the shaft
of my penis upon
a fiery scythe!

45:16.414 --> 45:18.548
As seen in this painting
I did last night.

45:18.550 --> 45:19.849
Ah, okay.

45:19.851 --> 45:21.484
Got it.

45:21.486 --> 45:23.486
That's graphic.

45:24.488 --> 45:26.322
What do you want to do
after college, Chance?

45:26.324 --> 45:30.993
I want to disappear completely.

45:30.995 --> 45:33.596
Oh, like a...
Like a magic trick.

45:33.598 --> 45:37.900
No, gone completely.

45:42.005 --> 45:43.606
Okay.

45:44.575 --> 45:46.342
Good... Good talking to you.

46:04.027 --> 46:06.262
You couldn't do it,
could you?

46:06.264 --> 46:08.197
We won, didn't we?

46:08.199 --> 46:09.465
One game.

46:09.467 --> 46:10.967
Man, what is your problem?

46:10.969 --> 46:14.070
You hesitated.
You were scared.

46:14.072 --> 46:18.141
Now, I know this is
just a fun, kissy-pants
carousel ride for you.

46:18.143 --> 46:20.777
I need this.

46:20.779 --> 46:24.147
Now, look,
not a day goes by

46:24.149 --> 46:25.615
that I don't regret
what happened to you.

46:25.617 --> 46:28.584
Why? You threw
the perfect pass.

46:28.586 --> 46:31.053
Anything else,
we would have
lost that game,

46:31.055 --> 46:32.722
lost the championship.

46:32.724 --> 46:34.724
Yeah, well,
you'd still be able
to walk, wouldn't you?

46:34.726 --> 46:37.126
It wasn't your fault!

46:39.396 --> 46:42.565
Sure, I miss the game. I...

46:42.567 --> 46:45.268
I used to feel
so alive out there.

46:45.270 --> 46:47.236
Wind sweeping against my hair,

46:47.238 --> 46:51.274
the slow drain of blood
into my still-working penis

46:51.276 --> 46:53.075
to form the perfect half chub

46:53.077 --> 46:56.913
that felt so awesome
against my freshly
laundered shorts.

46:56.915 --> 46:58.414
I just...

46:59.783 --> 47:02.752
But those days are over.

47:03.754 --> 47:07.757
These men need you.

47:07.759 --> 47:11.127
Grant,
it's just intramurals.

47:11.129 --> 47:13.262
Not anymore.

47:13.264 --> 47:15.431
You've changed things.

47:15.433 --> 47:17.266
Getting the old team
back together,

47:17.268 --> 47:20.002
you've given these men
a sense of purpose.

47:22.373 --> 47:24.941
You're finger blasting
fate, kid.

47:27.111 --> 47:30.379
Yeah, well,
what if I can't, huh?

47:30.381 --> 47:32.181
What if I fail?

47:33.317 --> 47:36.118
You know,
Franklin Roosevelt once said,

47:36.120 --> 47:39.288
"Any boy can piss
on the floor.

47:39.290 --> 47:43.659
"It takes a real man
to crap on the ceiling."

47:43.661 --> 47:46.796
Can you crap
on the ceiling, Caleb?

47:46.798 --> 47:49.365
It's not a metaphor.

48:04.248 --> 48:07.216
You were right.

48:07.218 --> 48:09.418
I did see
a different team
out there.

48:09.420 --> 48:10.820
What happened, huh?

48:10.822 --> 48:13.990
Well, you know,
people change.

48:13.992 --> 48:15.491
What are you doing here?

48:15.493 --> 48:17.526
Doesn't your,
uh, uterus buddy

48:17.528 --> 48:19.809
have a game in 10 minutes?

48:21.398 --> 48:23.032
You're not going?

48:23.034 --> 48:24.333
No.

48:24.335 --> 48:26.903
Figured I'd see
what you were up to.

48:29.006 --> 48:33.175
You wanna go somewhere?

48:33.177 --> 48:34.443
All right,
you all right?

48:34.445 --> 48:36.212
I'm good.
Whoa. Okay, you're good.

48:36.214 --> 48:38.447
So you swear there's
no crazy homeless people

48:38.449 --> 48:40.016
living in here or anything?

48:40.018 --> 48:41.751
Oh, yeah,
I assure you.

48:41.753 --> 48:43.085
It...

48:44.121 --> 48:45.788
Is clean.

48:45.790 --> 48:46.856
You all right?

48:46.858 --> 48:48.357
I'm great.
Okay.

48:48.359 --> 48:50.192
So how'd you find out
about this place?

48:50.194 --> 48:52.528
Well, Grant and I
worked here in high school.

48:52.530 --> 48:54.030
Oh.
Awesome, right?

48:54.032 --> 48:55.064
Yeah.
Yeah.

48:55.066 --> 48:56.599
Our senior year,
it got shut down,

48:56.601 --> 48:58.434
but I held on
to a key, and, uh,

48:58.436 --> 49:00.536
they never changed the locks,
so here we are.

49:00.538 --> 49:02.738
Kept a key just,
what, thinking maybe

49:02.740 --> 49:07.109
you could, like,
take a girl here
and flip the disco balls

49:07.111 --> 49:09.312
and put on
the sexy lights,

49:09.314 --> 49:11.380
maybe some sweet tasty jams.

49:11.382 --> 49:13.049
Here goes.

49:17.955 --> 49:19.388
Behold.

49:21.591 --> 49:23.392
That's still pretty cool.

49:23.394 --> 49:25.962
Even when
you know it's coming,
it's still pretty cool.

49:25.964 --> 49:27.396
Am I right?

49:27.398 --> 49:28.764
You might be right.

49:32.070 --> 49:34.670
Hey!

49:34.672 --> 49:37.273
Have you come
to eat my brains?

49:37.275 --> 49:39.575
What the hell?
I thought you said there
were no homeless people.

49:39.577 --> 49:41.410
I did not think there
was anyone here, I swear.

49:41.412 --> 49:43.179
Who sent you? Who?

49:43.181 --> 49:44.747
Yeah, we didn't know
anyone was here.

49:44.749 --> 49:46.148
We're just...
We're gonna go.

49:46.150 --> 49:47.416
Like hell.

49:47.418 --> 49:51.087
Fenton! Cheesedog!

49:51.089 --> 49:53.022
Who intrudeth into
the Thunderdome?

49:53.024 --> 49:56.359
Minions, attack!

49:56.361 --> 49:57.526
No, no. Whoa. Come on.

49:57.528 --> 49:59.762
No, no. Whoa!

50:00.430 --> 50:02.264
Raah!
Hyah!

50:02.266 --> 50:04.166
- Whoa!
- Cheesedog!

50:04.168 --> 50:05.501
Okay. Let's go.

50:05.503 --> 50:06.602
I am so sorry.

50:06.604 --> 50:10.006
I'm gonna drink
the inside of your face!

50:10.507 --> 50:13.109
Yaah!

50:18.281 --> 50:20.850
That was weird.

50:20.852 --> 50:22.518
Yeah.

50:22.520 --> 50:25.121
Did you see that kick?
Yes, I did.

50:25.123 --> 50:27.556
I think I knocked out some
of the homeless guy's teeth.

50:27.558 --> 50:28.858
That was amazing.

50:28.860 --> 50:30.693
Damn, I should have
grabbed some of them

50:30.695 --> 50:32.294
for a scrapbook,
or... I don't know...

50:32.296 --> 50:34.230
I could have made you
a necklace or something.

50:34.232 --> 50:35.364
Let's go back.

50:35.366 --> 50:36.866
I think they'd
probably make us

50:36.868 --> 50:38.968
do some pretty weird stuff
if we did, so we shouldn't.

50:38.970 --> 50:40.302
Yeah, yeah.

50:40.304 --> 50:42.238
So I got a question for you.
Okay.

50:42.240 --> 50:44.807
What is it like graduating?

50:44.809 --> 50:47.143
Well, um,

50:47.145 --> 50:49.311
the ceremony was lovely.

50:49.313 --> 50:51.814
Uh, my parents
flew in from Boston.

50:51.816 --> 50:54.450
I meant... I mean, like,
um, what comes after?

50:55.252 --> 50:57.486
Like the rest of your life?

50:57.488 --> 50:59.722
Yeah. I mean, isn't it...

50:59.724 --> 51:01.524
It's terrifying, right?

51:01.526 --> 51:04.226
No, I mean, you don't have
to figure it out right away.

51:04.228 --> 51:05.895
There's plenty of time.

51:05.897 --> 51:07.930
Yeah, I just wish it
was a little more clear,

51:07.932 --> 51:09.532
you know, like football.
It's just simple.

51:09.534 --> 51:11.333
It kind of is.
It's a game of inches.

51:11.335 --> 51:13.069
I mean, you take it
one play at a time, right?

51:13.071 --> 51:14.837
You don't think about
what you're gonna be doing

51:14.839 --> 51:17.440
in the fourth quarter when
you're in the first, right?

51:17.442 --> 51:18.574
Yeah.

51:18.842 --> 51:20.076
Sorry.

51:20.078 --> 51:21.577
That was lame. That was...

51:21.579 --> 51:23.679
No. No, no, no.
Oh, my God, no.

51:23.681 --> 51:25.014
It's okay.
No, no, no.

51:25.016 --> 51:26.615
Look, uh,
sports metaphors,

51:26.617 --> 51:29.418
that's... That's
my love language.

51:29.420 --> 51:31.620
Phew!

51:38.128 --> 51:40.262
Heh.

51:40.264 --> 51:42.064
Um...

51:42.066 --> 51:44.700
I need to tell you
something.

51:44.702 --> 51:48.270
Uh, can you tell me after?

51:48.272 --> 51:49.405
Yeah.
Okay.

51:49.407 --> 51:52.108
Well, look what
we have here.

51:52.110 --> 51:53.776
Hi, Dick.

51:53.778 --> 51:55.377
It's not weird
when you do that.

51:55.379 --> 51:58.114
You do realize
we're twins, Fuller.

51:58.116 --> 51:59.915
We share DNA,

51:59.917 --> 52:02.718
so when you're
all up in her mouth space
like that,

52:02.720 --> 52:04.887
it's just like you're
doing it with me.

52:06.057 --> 52:08.057
How do I taste,
Fuller, huh?

52:08.059 --> 52:09.558
Do I taste like Dick?

52:09.560 --> 52:10.626
You taste like dick?

52:10.628 --> 52:13.629
No. I'm Dick. Shut up.

52:13.631 --> 52:15.164
I'll tell you what
I don't taste like,

52:15.166 --> 52:16.632
cranapple juice boxes.

52:16.634 --> 52:18.968
I'm sorry I missed your game.

52:18.970 --> 52:20.402
It's cool.

52:20.404 --> 52:22.138
Just a minor sibling betrayal.

52:22.140 --> 52:25.174
We still won
despite lack
of proper hydration.

52:25.176 --> 52:26.675
How'd your team
fare, Fuller?

52:26.677 --> 52:29.517
You put on
a failure clinic
like last week?

52:30.114 --> 52:31.580
Uh, we won actually.

52:31.582 --> 52:33.082
Yeah, beat the Oilers
by seven.

52:33.084 --> 52:34.250
It was awesome.

52:34.252 --> 52:35.751
The Oilers? Damn.

52:35.753 --> 52:36.919
Right?
They're good.

52:36.921 --> 52:38.287
Shut up, Ace.

52:38.289 --> 52:39.588
What are you doing?

52:39.590 --> 52:41.423
He was talking.

52:41.425 --> 52:42.958
He was just...

52:42.960 --> 52:45.094
Thank you.

52:45.096 --> 52:48.264
Hey, Dick, do you
think you could
leave us alone now?

52:48.266 --> 52:50.299
I need five more seconds
of intimidation staring.

52:50.301 --> 52:52.101
Mm, no.

52:53.003 --> 52:54.937
Now.
Fine.

52:56.273 --> 52:57.673
But I'm telling Mom.

52:58.942 --> 53:01.610
Oh, and, Fuller,

53:01.612 --> 53:04.046
remember, even though
you may have won tonight,

53:04.048 --> 53:07.816
you're still gonna
have to face me
and my boys again,

53:07.818 --> 53:10.152
and we're gonna make
that last game

53:10.154 --> 53:12.354
look like a prepubescent
tickle fight.

53:13.658 --> 53:15.558
Why are you... Stop.
Is that you tickling?

53:15.560 --> 53:17.793
Tickleboy!

53:17.795 --> 53:18.861
Tickleboy.

53:18.863 --> 53:20.362
Tickleboy!
Tickleboy?

53:20.364 --> 53:21.463
Come on, brodeos.

53:21.465 --> 53:23.232
Let's make like
Lil' Bow Wow

53:23.234 --> 53:24.366
and ball bounce.

53:24.368 --> 53:25.868
It's <i> Roll Bounce.</i>

53:25.870 --> 53:27.469
That doesn't make
any sense.

53:27.471 --> 53:31.140
Rolls don't bounce.
Balls do. Idiot.

53:31.142 --> 53:32.474
It is <i> Roll Bounce.</i>

53:32.476 --> 53:33.776
Come on, Ace!

53:34.678 --> 53:36.178
Wow.

53:36.180 --> 53:37.613
Yeah.

53:39.749 --> 53:43.085
So, uh, where were we?

53:43.087 --> 53:44.987
I think you said

53:44.989 --> 53:47.270
you had something
you wanted to tell me.

53:48.992 --> 53:50.059
Nope.

53:50.061 --> 53:51.160
No?

53:51.162 --> 53:52.861
No.

53:52.863 --> 53:55.097
You sure?
Yeah.

54:03.741 --> 54:05.040
Whoo! Whoo! Yeah!

54:44.548 --> 54:45.714
I'm excited.

54:50.588 --> 54:51.654
You're gonna run it?

54:51.656 --> 54:52.988
That's how
this is gonna go?

54:52.990 --> 54:54.223
You're not even blocking.

54:54.225 --> 54:56.345
Going right here?
Come on.

55:15.246 --> 55:16.912
Yeah! Touchdown!

55:26.590 --> 55:28.190
<i>What up, players?</i>

55:28.192 --> 55:30.426
<i>Double D, Dick Downs here.</i>
Don't do it, Dick.

55:30.428 --> 55:32.594
<i>Just got a full scholarship
to play college ball.</i>

55:32.596 --> 55:35.698
<i>And this right here</i>
<i>is my sweet new ride...</i>
Don't do it.

55:35.700 --> 55:37.866
<i>...the alumni just
gave me for free.</i>

55:37.868 --> 55:39.635
<i>And guess what.
Right now,</i>

55:39.637 --> 55:42.104
<i>got a new car,
feeling like a star.</i>

55:42.106 --> 55:43.839
No.
<i>Let's ghost ride!</i>

55:43.841 --> 55:46.342
No, don't do it.
Just get in the car,
and go home.

55:46.344 --> 55:48.444
<i>Oh. Oh.</i>

55:48.446 --> 55:50.379
Oh, no, no, just...

55:50.381 --> 55:51.880
Just go dance
somewhere else.

55:51.882 --> 55:53.615
<i>I'm gonna live forever, baby!</i>

55:53.617 --> 55:55.818
<i>Oh, no.
Dick is on the roof.</i>

55:55.820 --> 55:57.486
Oh, no.
<i>Ghost ride that whip.</i>

55:57.488 --> 55:58.620
You're on the roof.

55:58.622 --> 56:00.622
<i>Ghost ride that... Ohh.</i>

56:00.624 --> 56:02.491
<i>Oh, no. Ahh!</i>

56:06.163 --> 56:08.964
<i>Oh, no! My leg! Aah!</i>

56:08.966 --> 56:11.300
<i>Duke is gonna kill me!</i>
Get up, you pussy.

56:11.302 --> 56:12.668
Get up, you pussy.

56:12.670 --> 56:14.470
<i>I got a box of steroids
in the backseat of my car.</i>

56:14.472 --> 56:16.171
<i>Dude, stop filming!</i>

56:16.173 --> 56:17.740
<i>Go get 'em, dude!</i>

56:19.376 --> 56:21.410
Dick.
Whoa! Ace!

56:21.412 --> 56:23.312
I put a scrunchie
on the door!

56:23.314 --> 56:27.015
Can't you see I'm reliving
my past failures to ensure
my future success?

56:27.017 --> 56:29.551
Yeah. Sorry. I just
want to let you know

56:29.553 --> 56:31.053
the Panthers
won again tonight.

56:31.055 --> 56:32.755
They, um,
made the playoffs.

56:32.757 --> 56:34.990
Who gives a shit?

56:34.992 --> 56:37.059
I'm just...
I'm just worried.

56:37.061 --> 56:40.329
They've gotten really good.

56:40.331 --> 56:41.764
They're impenetrable.

56:43.234 --> 56:44.833
Trust me, Ace.

56:44.835 --> 56:46.602
I'll penetrate them.

56:46.604 --> 56:47.936
How?

56:47.938 --> 56:49.405
Oh, I don't know.

56:50.540 --> 56:51.907
Sneak up on them

56:51.909 --> 56:54.243
and ruin their hopes
and dreams?

56:55.712 --> 56:57.513
Like a ghost.

56:57.515 --> 56:59.114
Heh.

57:00.517 --> 57:01.850
Heh.

57:02.719 --> 57:03.919
What was that?
Nothing. I was...

57:03.921 --> 57:06.355
Get out of my room, dude!
Okay.

57:06.357 --> 57:07.856
Do you understand...
Do you understand who...

57:07.858 --> 57:08.924
Don't do that to me.

57:08.926 --> 57:10.359
I'm gonna go.

57:11.394 --> 57:12.861
This never happened!

57:17.233 --> 57:18.700
Yeah!
All right.

57:18.702 --> 57:20.035
Chug time.

57:20.037 --> 57:21.237
We did it, man!

57:21.238 --> 57:22.471
Couldn't have done it
without you.

57:22.473 --> 57:23.972
Dude, nothing
can stop us now.

57:23.974 --> 57:26.275
Boo. Heh heh heh.

57:26.277 --> 57:28.043
Can we join the party?

57:28.045 --> 57:31.213
We weren't expecting
the male strippers
until later.

57:31.215 --> 57:34.550
That's funny,
because you're stripped
of your ability to walk.

57:34.552 --> 57:36.452
That is not
a proportional response.

57:37.555 --> 57:39.154
You got a problem,
Lindsay Brohan?

57:39.156 --> 57:40.923
No problem at all,
Brosario Dawson.

57:40.925 --> 57:43.392
We were just looking
for a sausage festival.

57:43.394 --> 57:44.893
Dick, you should leave.

57:44.895 --> 57:46.395
You know, Fuller,
my sister

57:46.397 --> 57:48.297
did always have a thing
for spineless pussies

57:48.299 --> 57:49.565
who are inadvertently
responsible

57:49.567 --> 57:50.766
for crippling
their best friend.

57:50.768 --> 57:52.067
What do you want, Dick?

57:52.969 --> 57:54.403
I just wanted
to be courteous

57:54.405 --> 57:56.572
and introduce you
to the newest member
of our team.

57:56.574 --> 57:58.173
We recruited him
a couple days ago.

57:58.175 --> 57:59.908
Now, he's a little bit shy,

57:59.910 --> 58:02.811
so make him
feel welcome, okay?

58:02.813 --> 58:04.313
Thad!

58:07.750 --> 58:09.785
What is that?

58:09.787 --> 58:12.254
Looks like a dad-gum horse
from the farm.

58:12.256 --> 58:13.956
That's Thad "Rufio" Johnson.

58:13.958 --> 58:16.091
He's the toughest
linebacker
in the NFL, man.

58:16.093 --> 58:17.759
He's got seven Pro Bowls,

58:17.761 --> 58:19.261
two Defensive Player
of the Year awards

58:19.263 --> 58:21.096
And a Super Bowl
with Green Bay.

58:21.098 --> 58:23.432
He got kicked out
last year for
substance abuse.

58:23.434 --> 58:26.301
I'm sure you all heard
about the substance-abuse
controversy.

58:26.303 --> 58:29.137
Well, with a little
spare time on his hands,

58:29.139 --> 58:31.607
Thad decided to make
his gam-gam happy

58:31.609 --> 58:32.941
and go back to college.

58:32.943 --> 58:36.278
I ran into him a couple
of weeks ago on campus,

58:36.280 --> 58:37.946
and we hit it off!

58:37.948 --> 58:40.449
Turns out he
was looking for an outlet

58:40.451 --> 58:42.718
for his rampant,
unchecked aggression.

58:42.720 --> 58:46.154
Dude, you can't just recruit
a former NFL superstar to be
on your football team.

58:46.156 --> 58:49.157
Oh, sure you can.
I know, because
I read the rule book

58:49.159 --> 58:50.792
like I do
an issue of <i> Maxim.</i>

58:50.794 --> 58:53.161
Cover to cover
on the elliptical
while watching <i> Entourage.</i>

58:53.163 --> 58:55.397
And the rules state
that the only qualifications

58:55.399 --> 58:59.167
to be in the league is
to be a registered student,

58:59.169 --> 59:01.470
which Thad is.
Right, Thad?

59:03.474 --> 59:06.542
Oh, speaking of rules,

59:06.544 --> 59:09.811
this is an official document
from the university.

59:09.813 --> 59:12.147
Should I read it
aloud, Ace?

59:12.149 --> 59:14.149
Oh, I think
you should, Dick.

59:14.151 --> 59:16.852
I think that's a good idea.

59:16.854 --> 59:20.489
It reads, "Dear
Mr. Grant Rosenfalis..."

59:20.491 --> 59:21.924
That's you.

59:21.926 --> 59:23.859
"We regret to inform you

59:23.861 --> 59:27.162
"that due to your refusal
to pay tuition,

59:27.164 --> 59:31.400
"you are no longer
a registered student
at this university."

59:31.402 --> 59:34.970
Oooooh.

59:37.607 --> 59:38.840
You know
what that means?

59:38.842 --> 59:41.443
Yeah, it means
I owe Caleb 10 bucks,

59:41.445 --> 59:43.278
because we made a bet
that you were illiterate.

59:43.280 --> 59:45.714
Oh, I'm literate,
and I can read,

59:45.716 --> 59:47.449
and I'm a student,
unlike Grant,

59:47.451 --> 59:49.418
and since he's
on your official roster

59:49.420 --> 59:50.886
as a team member,
you're boned.

59:50.888 --> 59:52.454
I boned you.

59:52.922 --> 59:55.190
That can't be right.

59:55.192 --> 59:56.858
It is.

59:56.860 --> 59:59.795
You either have to
kick him off the team

59:59.797 --> 01:00:00.896
or forfeit.

01:00:00.898 --> 01:00:02.030
Grant.

01:00:02.032 --> 01:00:03.565
Let me go.

01:00:03.567 --> 01:00:04.866
Can't you do something?

01:00:04.868 --> 01:00:06.401
Sorry, Fuller.
She's an adult,

01:00:06.403 --> 01:00:07.703
and adults do their jobs,

01:00:07.705 --> 01:00:09.938
even when it
crushes their soul.

01:00:09.940 --> 01:00:12.908
Oh, speaking
of crushing souls,

01:00:12.910 --> 01:00:15.477
bring her in!

01:00:15.479 --> 01:00:17.379
Oh.
Is this the...

01:00:17.381 --> 01:00:19.114
What is my surprise?

01:00:19.116 --> 01:00:21.717
I got...
Oh!

01:00:22.820 --> 01:00:24.219
It's Caleb.

01:00:24.221 --> 01:00:26.922
Caleb is my surprise.

01:00:26.924 --> 01:00:29.424
What a hard surprise.
Yeah.

01:00:29.426 --> 01:00:32.394
Mmm.

01:00:32.396 --> 01:00:35.664
Heh heh. I thought
you were at LSAT class.

01:00:35.666 --> 01:00:37.933
Who's she?
Who am I?

01:00:37.935 --> 01:00:43.505
I'm the girl
who gave him this thing,

01:00:43.507 --> 01:00:44.773
which is...

01:00:44.775 --> 01:00:46.141
Caleb, where's your ring?

01:00:46.143 --> 01:00:47.643
This is a contract
for a wedding chapel

01:00:47.645 --> 01:00:50.746
for one Caleb Fuller
and Vicky Albrects

01:00:50.748 --> 01:00:53.649
on November 30th of this year.

01:00:58.655 --> 01:01:00.956
You're engaged.

01:01:00.958 --> 01:01:02.991
I prefer the term betrothed...
Okay.

01:01:02.993 --> 01:01:04.292
...and, yes,
we are betrothed,

01:01:04.294 --> 01:01:05.827
and I'm sorry.
Who are you?

01:01:06.963 --> 01:01:08.664
Who am I?

01:01:10.667 --> 01:01:12.868
Was I just one last fling
before you go?

01:01:12.870 --> 01:01:15.570
No. Meredith...

01:01:19.609 --> 01:01:20.849
No, thanks.

01:01:21.944 --> 01:01:23.578
You are not a man.

01:01:25.381 --> 01:01:27.015
You're a bacterium.

01:01:29.385 --> 01:01:31.319
There's no wedding.

01:01:31.321 --> 01:01:33.955
You're a douche.

01:01:33.957 --> 01:01:35.957
A big douche.

01:01:39.529 --> 01:01:41.229
Yay!

01:01:42.131 --> 01:01:44.232
You've been ghosted.

01:01:44.234 --> 01:01:47.602
Care to say anything ominous
before we leave, Thad?

01:01:48.204 --> 01:01:49.304
Ciao.

01:01:49.306 --> 01:01:50.972
In case you didn't know,

01:01:50.974 --> 01:01:53.475
that's French
for "raising the stakes."

01:01:53.477 --> 01:01:54.543
Uhh!

01:01:56.079 --> 01:01:57.145
Get out of here.

01:01:57.147 --> 01:01:59.047
Go. Go.

01:02:01.684 --> 01:02:03.151
Dick.

01:02:09.726 --> 01:02:12.828
Well, Bill,
one more game left
until the playoffs,

01:02:12.830 --> 01:02:14.429
and the Panthers
are a shoo-in,

01:02:14.431 --> 01:02:17.165
but tonight, they're not
getting any favors

01:02:17.167 --> 01:02:19.568
from the all-female team,
the Maneaters.

01:02:19.570 --> 01:02:22.003
I'm gonna euthanize
your grandma!

01:02:22.005 --> 01:02:23.572
Aah!

01:02:23.574 --> 01:02:25.507
And with no Grant Rosenfalis,

01:02:25.509 --> 01:02:27.589
they're not looking
good out there.

01:02:34.718 --> 01:02:36.017
Focus.

01:02:39.089 --> 01:02:40.422
They're eating men

01:02:40.424 --> 01:02:42.057
and shitting out touchdowns.

01:02:42.059 --> 01:02:43.558
Touchdown Maneaters!

01:02:43.560 --> 01:02:46.728
And I'm getting
more and more turned on
by the second.

01:02:48.565 --> 01:02:51.366
Wow, that does
not look like the same
Panther team.

01:02:51.368 --> 01:02:53.401
Come on, Vinnie!
Get your head
in the game, man.

01:02:53.403 --> 01:02:55.103
You been griping
all season.
Back off, Hank.

01:02:55.105 --> 01:02:57.706
Look, I don't want to lose
to a bunch of chicks.

01:02:57.708 --> 01:02:59.107
Who you calling chicks?

01:02:59.109 --> 01:03:01.610
Okay, sweetheart,
baby-doll,

01:03:01.612 --> 01:03:04.546
the big, strong guys
are gonna have
a conversation now,

01:03:04.548 --> 01:03:08.049
so why don't you just
Brosie Bro'Donnell away?

01:03:08.051 --> 01:03:09.451
Oh!
Oh!

01:03:09.453 --> 01:03:11.453
Whoa!
Oh!

01:03:13.890 --> 01:03:15.724
Did you just punch me
in the face?

01:03:15.726 --> 01:03:17.492
Oh!
Oh!

01:03:17.494 --> 01:03:19.561
Ohh.

01:03:22.332 --> 01:03:26.268
I have done a lot of
terrible things in my life,

01:03:26.270 --> 01:03:30.405
but I am not
gonna punch a girl!

01:03:30.407 --> 01:03:31.506
Hyah!

01:03:31.508 --> 01:03:32.607
Whoa!
Yeah!

01:03:32.609 --> 01:03:33.675
What the hell, man?

01:03:33.677 --> 01:03:35.243
Hey, I said
I wasn't gonna punch.

01:03:35.245 --> 01:03:37.579
Ohh!
Fight!

01:03:37.581 --> 01:03:38.914
No, no, no, no!

01:03:38.916 --> 01:03:39.981
What's happening? Ohh!

01:03:39.983 --> 01:03:41.316
It's
an all-out brawl!

01:03:41.318 --> 01:03:43.919
Oh, you hate to see the game
degraded to this level, Bill.

01:03:57.467 --> 01:03:59.267
Who started this?

01:03:59.269 --> 01:04:00.802
Those girls are
crazy, Officer.
Uh-huh.

01:04:00.804 --> 01:04:02.838
One of 'em threatened
to violate my nana.

01:04:02.840 --> 01:04:04.306
Uh-huh.
Sure, she did, son.

01:04:04.308 --> 01:04:06.007
Sure, she did.

01:04:06.009 --> 01:04:07.142
Damn it.

01:04:07.144 --> 01:04:09.177
My dad's gonna
kill me, Hank.

01:04:09.179 --> 01:04:12.147
I never been to jail before.
What are we gonna do?

01:04:12.149 --> 01:04:15.589
You just gotta
establish dominance
as soon as possible.

01:04:15.818 --> 01:04:17.452
Follow my lead.

01:04:23.292 --> 01:04:24.359
What are you
in for, kiddo?

01:04:24.361 --> 01:04:26.294
Murder, grandpa bitch.
Yaah!

01:04:26.296 --> 01:04:28.176
Whoa!
Whoa! Hey!

01:04:31.134 --> 01:04:32.500
Okay, I don't
want to fight.

01:04:32.502 --> 01:04:35.370
I got no beef
with anybody.

01:04:36.372 --> 01:04:38.640
Hope you like AIDS,
amigo.

01:04:40.410 --> 01:04:42.477
Why would I like AIDS?

01:04:51.989 --> 01:04:53.421
Panthers...

01:04:53.423 --> 01:04:54.589
You made bail!

01:04:56.159 --> 01:04:57.325
Yo! Yo, yo, yo.

01:04:57.327 --> 01:05:00.362
Hey, you gonna be
all right, Georgie.
You hear me?

01:05:00.364 --> 01:05:01.730
Hang in there,
buddy.

01:05:01.732 --> 01:05:03.098
Caleb?

01:05:04.166 --> 01:05:05.433
Vicky.

01:05:05.435 --> 01:05:07.435
I came
as soon as I heard.

01:05:08.404 --> 01:05:09.671
Have you sustained

01:05:09.673 --> 01:05:11.339
any long-term
psychological damage

01:05:11.341 --> 01:05:12.874
during your time
in the hole?

01:05:12.876 --> 01:05:15.877
No, there's no hole.

01:05:15.879 --> 01:05:18.113
This is a drunk tank.

01:05:18.115 --> 01:05:20.548
Is this
what the DMV is like?

01:05:20.550 --> 01:05:21.917
Okay.

01:05:21.919 --> 01:05:23.184
See? I told you.

01:05:23.186 --> 01:05:24.519
I told you
this would happen.

01:05:24.521 --> 01:05:26.087
I told you
you would skip class

01:05:26.089 --> 01:05:27.355
and then you would
cheat on me

01:05:27.357 --> 01:05:29.024
with someone who looks
like my cousin Maevid

01:05:29.026 --> 01:05:32.861
and that I would
have to bail your
perfect ass out of jail.

01:05:32.863 --> 01:05:36.064
Vicky.
And looky what happened.

01:05:36.066 --> 01:05:37.699
You jeopardized
our future.

01:05:37.701 --> 01:05:39.534
What future?

01:05:39.536 --> 01:05:42.537
I spoke to Father,

01:05:42.539 --> 01:05:45.707
and he thinks that you
deserve another chance.

01:05:45.709 --> 01:05:46.775
Vicky...

01:05:46.777 --> 01:05:48.376
If...
Okay.

01:05:48.378 --> 01:05:51.279
If you cut it out

01:05:51.281 --> 01:05:54.616
with this
intramural football shit,

01:05:54.618 --> 01:05:56.584
because our life together,

01:05:56.586 --> 01:05:59.587
buster,
that ain't no game.

01:05:59.589 --> 01:06:00.889
Caleb.

01:06:00.891 --> 01:06:03.325
Hank, I'm trying to deal
with this right now.

01:06:03.327 --> 01:06:05.493
It's Grant, his trailer.

01:06:05.495 --> 01:06:09.064
Something happened,
and it's bad.

01:06:13.469 --> 01:06:15.103
Oh, no.
Oh, my God.

01:06:15.105 --> 01:06:16.805
No, no, no, no, no.

01:06:18.007 --> 01:06:19.574
He's dead.

01:06:19.576 --> 01:06:22.243
Hey, guys,
need you to stay back.

01:06:22.245 --> 01:06:23.965
This is a restricted area.

01:06:24.647 --> 01:06:25.981
Did he suffer?

01:06:25.983 --> 01:06:27.282
Huh? Oh.

01:06:27.284 --> 01:06:28.750
Absolutely.

01:06:28.752 --> 01:06:31.152
Probably could have
escaped, too, but, uh,

01:06:31.154 --> 01:06:33.188
place wasn't
too wheelchair friendly.

01:06:33.190 --> 01:06:35.857
You know, I'm just
a simple fireman,

01:06:35.859 --> 01:06:38.793
but whoever
inadvertently caused
his paralysis

01:06:38.795 --> 01:06:42.597
is in a way also
partly responsible
for his death.

01:06:42.599 --> 01:06:45.133
But not all bad news.

01:06:45.135 --> 01:06:46.935
I did find these
at the scene.

01:06:46.937 --> 01:06:48.269
Hey, come on, man.

01:06:48.271 --> 01:06:50.805
It's not just a free-for-all.

01:06:50.807 --> 01:06:52.474
They're Grant's aviators.

01:06:52.476 --> 01:06:55.043
They're completely
unscathed.

01:06:55.045 --> 01:06:56.444
So I guess those
are, like, uh,

01:06:56.446 --> 01:06:57.946
pretty symbolic
of your dead friend?

01:06:57.948 --> 01:06:59.414
Would you shut up?

01:07:00.016 --> 01:07:02.317
Sorry. Not my place.

01:07:02.319 --> 01:07:03.818
Grant's dead.

01:07:03.820 --> 01:07:05.353
He's dead.

01:07:05.355 --> 01:07:07.188
What are we gonna do?

01:07:08.024 --> 01:07:09.124
We have to forfeit.

01:07:09.126 --> 01:07:10.458
Are you kidding me?

01:07:10.460 --> 01:07:11.960
How are we supposed
to play tomorrow

01:07:11.962 --> 01:07:13.695
with Grant's death
hanging over our heads?

01:07:13.697 --> 01:07:15.463
This isn't
your fault, Caleb.

01:07:15.465 --> 01:07:17.532
I didn't say
it was my fault.

01:07:17.534 --> 01:07:19.534
Found the source
of the fire. Ha ha!

01:07:19.536 --> 01:07:21.803
It's an old
laser-disc player.

01:07:21.805 --> 01:07:25.473
Looks like he had a copy
of the original <i> Rocky</i>
in it, too.

01:07:25.475 --> 01:07:27.842
Ha. Great flick.
Heh heh.

01:07:27.844 --> 01:07:30.645
"Yo, Adrian!"

01:07:30.647 --> 01:07:35.050
Look, you guys
got one more week
before the playoffs,

01:07:35.052 --> 01:07:38.486
but you're gonna have
to find another man,
because I quit.

01:07:38.488 --> 01:07:40.655
Oh, no. No,
you can't quit,
all right?

01:07:40.657 --> 01:07:41.823
I mean, we need you.

01:07:41.825 --> 01:07:44.225
No, you don't.

01:07:44.227 --> 01:07:46.227
Come on, guys.
Let's go.

01:07:46.229 --> 01:07:48.530
Let's let
the king of the babies

01:07:48.532 --> 01:07:51.433
give a speech
to his baby servants.

01:07:51.435 --> 01:07:53.468
"Wah wah," speech.

01:08:01.110 --> 01:08:05.113
You know, there's
a really scenic lake
about a mile up the way.

01:08:05.115 --> 01:08:08.349
Could be a good place
for you to somberly reflect

01:08:08.351 --> 01:08:10.919
on your friend's life
and tragic death.

01:08:14.623 --> 01:08:16.791
I'll leave you to grieve.

01:08:28.737 --> 01:08:31.038
Why'd you have
to leave me, Grant?

01:09:22.591 --> 01:09:25.326
Hey, nice job,
Copperfail!

01:09:44.781 --> 01:09:47.948
Hey, you got that right.

01:10:12.074 --> 01:10:16.144
Today, you are
taking the Law School
Admissions Test.

01:10:16.146 --> 01:10:18.413
You will have four hours.

01:10:18.415 --> 01:10:19.814
Please begin.

01:10:25.755 --> 01:10:30.158
Um, okay, uh,
outside, everyone.

01:10:30.160 --> 01:10:31.259
Leave the tests.

01:10:31.261 --> 01:10:34.696
We should be able
to clear this up pretty soon.

01:10:42.504 --> 01:10:44.939
Psst!

01:10:44.941 --> 01:10:46.241
Psst!

01:10:47.743 --> 01:10:48.977
Hank?

01:10:52.214 --> 01:10:53.448
What are you doing here?

01:10:53.450 --> 01:10:55.583
I pulled the fire alarm.

01:10:55.585 --> 01:10:57.352
What?
Shut up, man.

01:10:57.354 --> 01:10:59.287
Come on.
Why would you do that?

01:10:59.289 --> 01:11:01.022
I had to, man.
Why?

01:11:01.024 --> 01:11:03.858
Because you
can't do this, Caleb.

01:11:03.860 --> 01:11:05.426
Hank, you and I
live together.

01:11:05.428 --> 01:11:07.195
Why don't you
just talk to me then?

01:11:07.197 --> 01:11:08.396
Because I'm a dick,

01:11:08.398 --> 01:11:09.864
I'm totally out of control,

01:11:09.866 --> 01:11:12.200
I'm rude, I say
awful things about people,

01:11:12.202 --> 01:11:13.968
but you've always
been cool to me, man.

01:11:13.970 --> 01:11:15.970
Hank, I appreciate
you coming down here
to say that, but...

01:11:15.972 --> 01:11:17.639
Shut up!
I'm in the middle
of something.

01:11:17.641 --> 01:11:20.875
Ah! There I go
being a dick again.
Okay.

01:11:20.877 --> 01:11:23.311
Caleb, you have
to come back.

01:11:23.313 --> 01:11:25.446
No, I can't.

01:11:25.448 --> 01:11:28.216
Man, this team
is like the closest

01:11:28.218 --> 01:11:30.318
I've ever been
to having real friends,

01:11:30.320 --> 01:11:34.389
'cause you've given me a place
that I didn't have before,

01:11:34.391 --> 01:11:36.124
a place that I belong.

01:11:36.126 --> 01:11:37.892
These moments

01:11:37.894 --> 01:11:40.895
are the most precious gifts
we've been given,

01:11:40.897 --> 01:11:44.966
the most sacred, and if
we turn our back on them,

01:11:47.403 --> 01:11:51.072
that is when we
truly have nothing.

01:11:51.074 --> 01:11:53.474
Is that a line from
<i>The Sisterhood</i>
<i>of the Traveling Pants?</i>

01:11:53.476 --> 01:11:55.576
Shut up!
It's a great movie, man!

01:11:55.578 --> 01:11:57.078
That's...
Awesome,

01:11:57.080 --> 01:12:00.248
and that chick
from <i> Gilmore Girls</i>
is hot as hell, man,

01:12:00.250 --> 01:12:01.582
and it's not because
she looks like a child.

01:12:01.584 --> 01:12:03.318
It's not a good movie.

01:12:03.320 --> 01:12:04.919
Okay, the point is,
after college,

01:12:04.921 --> 01:12:06.821
you got your whole life
figured out.

01:12:07.589 --> 01:12:09.424
This is all I have.

01:12:11.594 --> 01:12:13.428
Uh, I gotta go.

01:12:13.430 --> 01:12:15.129
Did you start
a real fire?

01:12:15.131 --> 01:12:16.531
What? No,
it's not important.

01:12:16.533 --> 01:12:18.599
Just be at the field
at 7:00 p.m. tonight.

01:12:18.601 --> 01:12:20.635
Vicky and I
have the wedding
shower tonight.

01:12:20.637 --> 01:12:23.604
Dude, you don't
want to marry her.

01:12:23.606 --> 01:12:24.972
There you go
being a dick again.

01:12:24.974 --> 01:12:26.107
No, man,

01:12:26.109 --> 01:12:27.809
that's me being a friend.

01:12:27.811 --> 01:12:29.177
Yeah, I've got him.

01:12:29.179 --> 01:12:31.012
Ohh!
That's me being a dick.

01:12:31.014 --> 01:12:32.447
Oh, my God.

01:12:32.449 --> 01:12:34.882
Hey! Get back here!

01:12:34.884 --> 01:12:37.852
Why would you do that?

01:12:37.854 --> 01:12:40.621
Sorry for
the false alarm, gang.

01:12:40.623 --> 01:12:43.124
Please begin your tests.

01:12:51.567 --> 01:12:53.234
Oh, my G.

01:12:53.236 --> 01:12:56.304
Daddy. Is this
a diamond-encrusted
serving tray?

01:12:56.306 --> 01:13:00.308
Not only that,
check the certificate
of authentication.

01:13:00.310 --> 01:13:02.243
Ahh! You guys,

01:13:02.245 --> 01:13:04.746
it's made with certified
blood diamonds.

01:13:05.815 --> 01:13:07.648
I love blood diamonds.

01:13:07.650 --> 01:13:09.150
That's not all.

01:13:09.152 --> 01:13:12.086
Caleb, a spot just
opened up at our firm.

01:13:12.088 --> 01:13:15.823
I had to fire two janitors
and a secretary to do it,

01:13:15.825 --> 01:13:17.925
but it's yours
as soon as you graduate.

01:13:17.927 --> 01:13:21.162
Thank you
so, so much.
Wooow.

01:13:21.164 --> 01:13:25.333
Wow, wow, wow,
wow, wow, wow.
All right.

01:13:25.335 --> 01:13:26.734
Oh, Daddy.

01:13:26.736 --> 01:13:30.171
My God,
what an occasion this is.

01:13:30.173 --> 01:13:33.241
Okay, why don't we all
go to the veranda

01:13:33.243 --> 01:13:35.910
for some champagne
and tofu tiramisu?

01:13:35.912 --> 01:13:38.413
Actually, it seems
as though there's
one more present.

01:13:38.415 --> 01:13:40.581
Ooh, a mystery gift.

01:13:42.851 --> 01:13:44.685
Plastic glasses.

01:13:44.687 --> 01:13:46.287
That's dumb.

01:13:46.289 --> 01:13:48.089
Who got me this?

01:13:48.091 --> 01:13:49.257
Lame.

01:13:49.259 --> 01:13:51.592
Okay, to the veranda we go.

01:13:54.897 --> 01:13:56.297
No.

01:13:56.299 --> 01:13:57.765
What do you mean "no"?

01:13:57.767 --> 01:13:59.267
Listen, everyone,
thank you so much

01:13:59.269 --> 01:14:03.871
for all the gifts,
but, um, I can't.

01:14:03.873 --> 01:14:05.039
You can't what?

01:14:05.041 --> 01:14:07.308
I have a game to get to.

01:14:07.310 --> 01:14:10.978
I thought you were done with
your intramural footballing.

01:14:10.980 --> 01:14:12.780
I'm sorry.

01:14:12.782 --> 01:14:15.383
I am just not ready.

01:14:15.385 --> 01:14:16.617
It goes without saying

01:14:16.619 --> 01:14:19.454
the job offer goes away
if you do this.

01:14:19.456 --> 01:14:21.889
Yes, sir. Thank you,

01:14:21.891 --> 01:14:26.127
but, uh, I think
I'd rather not know
my future right now.

01:14:28.797 --> 01:14:29.997
Caleb.

01:14:29.999 --> 01:14:32.567
Caleb, don't go.

01:14:32.569 --> 01:14:34.802
Caleb,
I'm pregnant!

01:14:37.739 --> 01:14:39.240
I'm kidding.
I'm kidding.

01:14:39.242 --> 01:14:41.476
Oh, honey,
don't make this weirder.

01:14:41.478 --> 01:14:42.777
That usually works.

01:14:43.913 --> 01:14:46.280
Five minutes
to game time,
Prancers.

01:14:46.282 --> 01:14:47.415
It's Panthers.

01:14:47.417 --> 01:14:49.083
I do not care.

01:14:49.085 --> 01:14:50.251
I don't think
he's gonna show.

01:14:50.253 --> 01:14:52.753
Well, maybe
we don't need him.

01:14:52.755 --> 01:14:54.288
I wish Grant was here.

01:14:54.290 --> 01:14:56.657
Grant is here.

01:14:59.027 --> 01:15:01.963
He's all around us.

01:15:01.965 --> 01:15:03.297
Caleb.

01:15:03.299 --> 01:15:05.633
Just in time, huh?

01:15:05.635 --> 01:15:07.668
What's up, brother?
Real dramatic.

01:15:07.670 --> 01:15:09.770
Are you ready for this?

01:15:09.772 --> 01:15:10.972
Almost.

01:15:10.974 --> 01:15:13.741
Gotta go take care
of one last thing.

01:15:14.643 --> 01:15:16.344
What?

01:15:17.946 --> 01:15:21.048
He just pumped us up
and then left?

01:15:21.050 --> 01:15:23.450
That's pretty
badass, though.

01:15:27.856 --> 01:15:29.590
Hey, Meredith.

01:15:30.292 --> 01:15:32.126
I'm not talking to you.

01:15:32.128 --> 01:15:34.896
Okay, that's fair.

01:15:34.898 --> 01:15:36.297
You don't
have to say anything.

01:15:36.299 --> 01:15:38.366
I just want you to know
that I'm really sorry

01:15:38.368 --> 01:15:40.034
I didn't tell you
I was engaged.

01:15:40.036 --> 01:15:41.502
That's awful.

01:15:41.504 --> 01:15:43.905
I'm sorry.

01:15:43.907 --> 01:15:46.007
That was a difficult situation,

01:15:46.009 --> 01:15:49.644
and I want you to know
it's over now, all right?

01:15:49.646 --> 01:15:50.711
That's great.

01:15:50.713 --> 01:15:55.383
Look, I got you
something, okay?

01:16:01.890 --> 01:16:04.825
Is that the homeless
guy's teeth?

01:16:04.827 --> 01:16:06.394
Yeah.

01:16:06.396 --> 01:16:09.096
How'd you get this?

01:16:09.098 --> 01:16:11.365
Ten bucks for his teeth.

01:16:11.367 --> 01:16:12.433
Five.

01:16:12.435 --> 01:16:14.936
Okay.

01:16:14.938 --> 01:16:16.070
And here you are, good sir.

01:16:16.072 --> 01:16:17.371
We prefer direct deposit.

01:16:17.373 --> 01:16:19.840
Like in your butt?

01:16:19.842 --> 01:16:22.009
No, you freaking weirdo.

01:16:22.011 --> 01:16:24.178
Just give me your email.
I'll invoice you.

01:16:24.180 --> 01:16:25.446
He had
an email address?

01:16:25.448 --> 01:16:26.681
I know. Right?

01:16:26.683 --> 01:16:28.449
How insane is that?

01:16:30.018 --> 01:16:33.287
Look, I know
I don't deserve it,

01:16:35.090 --> 01:16:38.125
but can you
just give me another shot

01:16:38.127 --> 01:16:40.094
to try to win you back?

01:16:40.096 --> 01:16:42.597
And how do you plan
on doing that?

01:16:45.233 --> 01:16:46.601
You'll see.

01:16:50.138 --> 01:16:51.539
I don't know
about you, Dan,

01:16:51.541 --> 01:16:52.773
but other than
fair-trade hummus,

01:16:52.775 --> 01:16:54.041
there's nothing in this life

01:16:54.043 --> 01:16:56.444
I love more than
intramural playoffs.

01:16:56.446 --> 01:16:58.879
Whole Foods and Japanese
hookers for me.

01:17:04.286 --> 01:17:06.621
<i>Caleb Fuller
with the interception.</i>

01:17:08.490 --> 01:17:12.727
<i>Thad "Rufio" Johnson
is a juggernaut.</i>

01:17:16.231 --> 01:17:18.591
<i>Double hit,
both men down.</i>

01:17:19.501 --> 01:17:23.237
<i>Caleb Fuller has
the eye of the tiger.</i>

01:17:37.085 --> 01:17:40.655
Welcome to
the pregame intramural
championship show,

01:17:40.657 --> 01:17:42.023
Panthers versus Titans.

01:17:42.025 --> 01:17:43.257
With me always is Bill.

01:17:43.259 --> 01:17:45.526
Bill, the Titans have been
on a tear lately

01:17:45.528 --> 01:17:49.764
with pick-up
of former NFL all-star
Thad "Rufio" Johnson.

01:17:49.766 --> 01:17:52.633
Do you think
that the Panthers
can stop him tonight?

01:17:52.635 --> 01:17:53.768
Highly unlikely, Dan.

01:17:53.770 --> 01:17:55.269
You see, had he
not been kicked out,

01:17:55.271 --> 01:17:57.271
it's likely that Johnson
would have been looking

01:17:57.273 --> 01:17:59.106
<i>at another three years
of NFL dominance.</i>

01:17:59.108 --> 01:18:01.442
Ah, so you're saying
it's a hopeless case?

01:18:01.444 --> 01:18:02.643
Well, according
to my stepdad,

01:18:02.645 --> 01:18:05.646
the only hopeless cases
are pussy liberals
and me.

01:18:05.648 --> 01:18:10.051
He's a mean bastard,
and I don't understand
how Cheryl can stand him.

01:18:10.053 --> 01:18:11.619
My mom's a saint,
but if the Panthers

01:18:11.621 --> 01:18:13.454
have taught us anything
this season,

01:18:13.456 --> 01:18:16.057
<i>it's that
anything is possible.</i>

01:18:16.059 --> 01:18:19.794
All right, men,
I got a few words.

01:18:19.796 --> 01:18:23.164
It's speech time,
douche bags.

01:18:23.166 --> 01:18:25.800
The last few months
have been the best
of my life,

01:18:25.802 --> 01:18:30.671
and this team,
you guys have meant
the world to me.

01:18:30.673 --> 01:18:32.006
The majority of you,

01:18:32.008 --> 01:18:35.242
I strongly dislike.

01:18:35.244 --> 01:18:38.045
Chance, you have become

01:18:38.047 --> 01:18:41.315
one of
the best receivers
I've ever seen.

01:18:41.317 --> 01:18:43.651
Randy,
if you drop one pass,

01:18:43.653 --> 01:18:47.154
I swear to God I will
burn your grandmother's
condo down.

01:18:47.156 --> 01:18:50.825
Vinnie, I've never
seen a quarterback find
the open man like you.

01:18:50.827 --> 01:18:56.163
Ace, your girlfriend
is cheating on you with me.

01:18:56.165 --> 01:18:58.432
She's ugly.

01:18:58.434 --> 01:19:04.205
Hank, you are the single
most intense player
I've ever seen.

01:19:04.207 --> 01:19:06.841
That's very kind
of you to say.

01:19:06.843 --> 01:19:08.709
Rufio!

01:19:08.711 --> 01:19:11.712
In all honesty,
you terrify me,
so you're cool.

01:19:11.714 --> 01:19:14.615
Jimmy, you are
a beast on the field,

01:19:14.617 --> 01:19:18.853
and you have
the voice of Gabriel.

01:19:18.855 --> 01:19:21.055
Donnie, your body
is a wonderland,

01:19:21.057 --> 01:19:22.189
and I hate you for it.

01:19:22.191 --> 01:19:23.557
George,

01:19:23.559 --> 01:19:25.593
you have had
quite a rough go of it,

01:19:25.595 --> 01:19:28.129
to say the least,
and your commitment
to this team,

01:19:28.131 --> 01:19:30.698
while misplaced
priority-wise,

01:19:30.700 --> 01:19:32.700
inspires me to get out
of bed in the morning.

01:19:32.702 --> 01:19:36.637
I don't know your name,
and I never will.

01:19:36.639 --> 01:19:39.640
Your dad,
your grandmother,

01:19:39.642 --> 01:19:42.042
your future employer,

01:19:42.044 --> 01:19:44.545
they may think
this is stupid,

01:19:44.547 --> 01:19:47.882
that it doesn't
mean anything,

01:19:47.884 --> 01:19:49.650
but 30 years from now,

01:19:49.652 --> 01:19:53.220
these are
the moments that we
will look back on.

01:19:53.222 --> 01:19:57.291
If we lose, I never
want to see any of you
ever again.

01:19:57.293 --> 01:19:58.826
Screw the memories.

01:19:58.828 --> 01:20:00.461
Winning is not everything.

01:20:00.463 --> 01:20:03.397
Winning is everything.

01:20:03.399 --> 01:20:04.565
I love you guys.

01:20:04.567 --> 01:20:06.167
I'm dead inside!

01:20:06.169 --> 01:20:07.568
Ha ha!

01:20:07.570 --> 01:20:10.638
Let's take a moment
of silence for Grant.

01:20:36.598 --> 01:20:37.698
All right,

01:20:37.700 --> 01:20:39.867
let's go out there
and play some football!

01:20:39.869 --> 01:20:40.935
Yeah!
Yep!

01:21:08.898 --> 01:21:11.065
This is it, Bill,
the final dance,

01:21:11.067 --> 01:21:12.466
the big hoorah,

01:21:12.468 --> 01:21:14.969
the game that discerns
the winners from the losers,

01:21:14.971 --> 01:21:16.337
the wheat from the chaff,

01:21:16.339 --> 01:21:18.973
the lingering
tongue-kiss butt fondle

01:21:18.975 --> 01:21:20.474
from the fake
phone-number handshake,

01:21:20.476 --> 01:21:22.543
and I don't
think I'm making
an overstatement

01:21:22.545 --> 01:21:25.346
when I say this
is the single
most important moment

01:21:25.348 --> 01:21:27.581
in the history
of athletics.
What say you, Bill?

01:21:27.583 --> 01:21:30.217
Well, Dan,
I think you said it all
in your raving diatribe,

01:21:30.219 --> 01:21:32.486
but I'm gonna
add one more
small point if I may.

01:21:32.488 --> 01:21:35.222
Are you ready
for some football?

01:21:41.096 --> 01:21:42.496
Steamroller!

01:21:46.935 --> 01:21:48.002
Fumble!

01:21:48.004 --> 01:21:50.905
Thad "Rufio" Johnson
recovers.

01:21:50.907 --> 01:21:52.039
Touchdown Titans.

01:21:52.041 --> 01:21:55.009
Unbelievable.

01:21:55.011 --> 01:21:56.343
Hey, Fuller,

01:21:56.345 --> 01:21:59.013
I'm glad Grant's dead.

01:22:02.684 --> 01:22:03.884
Yeah!

01:22:19.869 --> 01:22:21.869
Yeah!
Oh, come on, ref!

01:22:21.871 --> 01:22:24.238
And we're only
five plays into this game,

01:22:24.240 --> 01:22:26.273
and already
it's a bloodbath.

01:22:26.275 --> 01:22:29.235
And there is
so much more time left
in this half.

01:22:47.162 --> 01:22:49.229
Glory be to Dick!
Yeah.

01:22:49.231 --> 01:22:51.165
Oh, glory!

01:22:51.167 --> 01:22:52.800
Wow, I don't know
what happened,

01:22:52.802 --> 01:22:55.069
but the rest
of that half went by
much, much faster.

01:22:55.071 --> 01:22:56.904
But still equally as intense.

01:22:56.906 --> 01:22:59.139
You know, Dan, I don't
know what happened
to this Panther team,

01:22:59.141 --> 01:23:01.308
but they are gonna need
a serious miracle.

01:23:01.310 --> 01:23:02.977
That or an act of God.

01:23:02.979 --> 01:23:05.179
That's what
a miracle is, Dan.

01:23:12.420 --> 01:23:14.822
What do I do, Grant?

01:23:18.693 --> 01:23:20.227
What do I do?

01:23:21.129 --> 01:23:23.030
Stop talking
to your sunglasses,

01:23:23.032 --> 01:23:25.472
and start playing
football better.

01:23:28.603 --> 01:23:29.803
Grant?

01:23:32.108 --> 01:23:34.108
Are you a ghost?

01:23:34.110 --> 01:23:36.477
I thought you were dead.

01:23:37.980 --> 01:23:40.781
Well, you thought wrong,
thinky.

01:23:40.783 --> 01:23:41.882
But...

01:23:41.884 --> 01:23:44.385
Your trailer and the...
Your glasses?

01:23:44.387 --> 01:23:46.954
Do I really
have to explain this
to you?

01:23:46.956 --> 01:23:50.691
Yes, yes, you really
have to explain this to me.

01:23:50.693 --> 01:23:53.460
The primary
turning point
in all sports movies

01:23:53.462 --> 01:23:55.195
usually involves
the untimely death

01:23:55.197 --> 01:23:57.531
or paralysis
of a key character,

01:23:57.533 --> 01:24:00.601
quite often the coach/mentor.

01:24:01.803 --> 01:24:03.370
I faked it.

01:24:03.372 --> 01:24:04.471
What? Why...

01:24:04.473 --> 01:24:05.739
Why would you fake
your death?

01:24:05.741 --> 01:24:07.808
Because that's
how it's done.

01:24:07.810 --> 01:24:09.510
That's not how it's done.
What are you talking about?

01:24:09.512 --> 01:24:11.145
What reference point is that?

01:24:11.147 --> 01:24:12.746
You don't have
to fake your death

01:24:12.748 --> 01:24:15.182
for your intramural
football team to win.

01:24:15.184 --> 01:24:16.817
This isn't about winning.

01:24:16.819 --> 01:24:21.255
This is about
winning at the last
possible second

01:24:21.257 --> 01:24:23.490
when the chips are down

01:24:23.492 --> 01:24:26.326
and you're holding
a real hard hand

01:24:26.328 --> 01:24:30.264
with a fistful
of fate's fun-bags

01:24:30.266 --> 01:24:33.033
and you know
that if you squeeze
tight enough,

01:24:33.035 --> 01:24:37.504
you'll get to slurp
down on that sweet,
sweet glory milk.

01:24:37.506 --> 01:24:41.008
And when
you win like that,

01:24:41.409 --> 01:24:43.777
it changes you.

01:24:43.779 --> 01:24:45.279
So how do we do that?

01:24:45.281 --> 01:24:47.014
Because we are getting
slaughtered out there.

01:24:47.016 --> 01:24:50.484
You gotta crap
on the ceiling.

01:24:51.619 --> 01:24:53.320
That's impossible.

01:24:54.456 --> 01:24:56.857
When you got a team
beneath you,

01:24:56.859 --> 01:24:59.293
anything's possible.

01:25:05.301 --> 01:25:07.935
Grant said this would work!

01:25:07.937 --> 01:25:09.303
Come on, push, Caleb!

01:25:09.305 --> 01:25:11.872
Oh! Got... Got some
in my eye. That's fine.

01:25:11.874 --> 01:25:12.973
No, I got it!

01:25:12.975 --> 01:25:15.042
We got it.
It's okay.

01:25:16.212 --> 01:25:17.644
Yeah.

01:25:17.646 --> 01:25:19.713
Oh.

01:25:19.715 --> 01:25:22.783
That is definitely a metaphor.

01:25:22.785 --> 01:25:25.319
Oh, this is it
for the Panthers.

01:25:25.321 --> 01:25:26.553
Two quarters to come back

01:25:26.555 --> 01:25:29.389
from an almost impossible
23-point deficit.

01:25:29.391 --> 01:25:30.557
Real shame.

01:25:30.559 --> 01:25:31.592
Chance.

01:25:31.594 --> 01:25:33.260
Dad?

01:25:33.262 --> 01:25:35.762
Eh, what are you
doing here?

01:25:35.764 --> 01:25:38.932
I've come to tell you
to stop this foolishness,

01:25:38.934 --> 01:25:42.436
wearing the eye makeup,
doing the magic,

01:25:42.438 --> 01:25:46.006
playing football
with all these buffoons.

01:25:46.008 --> 01:25:47.341
They're not buffoons.

01:25:47.343 --> 01:25:48.909
They're my friends.

01:25:48.911 --> 01:25:51.945
The application
for medical school
is due tomorrow.

01:25:51.947 --> 01:25:53.080
I filled it in.

01:25:53.082 --> 01:25:56.517
All you have to do
is sign it.

01:25:58.453 --> 01:26:02.422
Come on, Son.
Think about your dreams.

01:26:04.926 --> 01:26:09.196
No, Dad, your dreams.

01:26:21.176 --> 01:26:22.976
Hey, guys,

01:26:22.978 --> 01:26:24.845
you know who this is for?

01:26:25.947 --> 01:26:27.481
It's for Grant.

01:26:33.154 --> 01:26:36.456
And the Titans receive
the ball at the start
of the second half.

01:26:36.458 --> 01:26:38.959
Oh, the clothesline!

01:26:38.961 --> 01:26:41.295
WWE at its finest.

01:26:43.232 --> 01:26:44.331
Right there.
Get your man.

01:26:44.333 --> 01:26:45.465
Cover one.

01:26:45.467 --> 01:26:47.801
Red 42. Red 42.

01:26:47.803 --> 01:26:48.869
Hut! Hut!

01:26:50.205 --> 01:26:53.974
Oh! Unbelievable pick
by Fuller.

01:26:53.976 --> 01:26:56.376
And the Panthers
are on the board.

01:26:56.378 --> 01:26:57.844
Yes! Whew!

01:27:28.777 --> 01:27:30.377
Whoo!

01:27:31.447 --> 01:27:32.879
Unbelievable.

01:27:32.881 --> 01:27:36.016
I've never seen
a second-half
turnaround like this.

01:27:36.018 --> 01:27:38.719
I can't remember
ever seeing anything
like this,

01:27:38.721 --> 01:27:40.721
but then again,
I don't remember
anything.

01:27:40.723 --> 01:27:43.043
I have the disease
from <i> Memento.</i>

01:27:49.198 --> 01:27:50.797
Down!

01:27:50.799 --> 01:27:51.965
Set!

01:28:03.712 --> 01:28:05.612
Good play, guys.
Congratulations.

01:28:05.614 --> 01:28:07.648
And with 40 seconds left,

01:28:07.650 --> 01:28:09.716
the Titans have extended
their lead to nine.

01:28:09.718 --> 01:28:12.319
The Panthers are
gonna have to create
some kind of miracle.

01:28:12.321 --> 01:28:14.721
What do we
do now, Caleb?

01:28:15.423 --> 01:28:16.723
Caleb?

01:28:18.559 --> 01:28:20.827
Hello?

01:28:20.829 --> 01:28:22.129
Caleb?

01:28:22.997 --> 01:28:24.131
Caleb!

01:28:25.633 --> 01:28:27.301
What do we do?

01:28:30.571 --> 01:28:32.306
We win the game.

01:28:41.949 --> 01:28:44.284
Another kick.
It's a high one.

01:28:44.286 --> 01:28:46.653
Caleb Fuller receives.
A lateral!

01:28:46.655 --> 01:28:49.423
Another lateral
to the mustache.

01:28:49.425 --> 01:28:52.526
It's like a young,
skinny Burt Reynolds.

01:28:52.528 --> 01:28:54.494
Touchdown Panthers!

01:28:58.334 --> 01:28:59.599
Whoop whoop.

01:29:02.437 --> 01:29:03.970
I don't believe it.

01:29:03.972 --> 01:29:06.606
Just like that,
the Panthers are
back in it.

01:29:06.608 --> 01:29:08.875
Down by two with
just 35 seconds left.

01:29:08.877 --> 01:29:10.944
If the Panthers have
any hope of scoring again,

01:29:10.946 --> 01:29:15.248
they're gonna
have to execute
a perfect onside kick.

01:29:19.221 --> 01:29:21.355
Do not screw this up!

01:29:41.477 --> 01:29:43.944
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

01:29:45.880 --> 01:29:47.247
Whew.

01:29:47.249 --> 01:29:48.982
And that's
the nail in the coffin

01:29:48.984 --> 01:29:50.984
if I've ever smoked one.

01:29:50.986 --> 01:29:53.320
And with 22 seconds left,

01:29:53.322 --> 01:29:55.689
all the Titans have to do
is hold on to the ball

01:29:55.691 --> 01:29:56.923
and watch
the clock run out.

01:29:56.925 --> 01:29:58.592
But it should be noted
that in intramurals,

01:29:58.594 --> 01:29:59.726
there is no taking a knee.

01:29:59.728 --> 01:30:00.994
The Titans
have to run a play

01:30:00.996 --> 01:30:02.062
for the clock to expire.

01:30:02.064 --> 01:30:03.597
True,
but all they have to do

01:30:03.599 --> 01:30:05.098
is give the ball
to Rufio.

01:30:05.100 --> 01:30:08.101
And what started out
as a beautiful
Cinderella story

01:30:08.103 --> 01:30:12.606
is rapidly turning into
a horrifying snuff film
for the Panthers.

01:30:12.608 --> 01:30:14.574
Just forget
about it, Caleb.

01:30:14.576 --> 01:30:16.676
We gave it
a good run, right?

01:30:16.678 --> 01:30:18.678
Yeah, I'm happy
to have played
with you guys.

01:30:18.680 --> 01:30:21.515
Yeah.
It's all been worth it.

01:30:21.517 --> 01:30:24.284
I want to try
something crazy.

01:30:24.286 --> 01:30:25.919
They're just
gonna hand the ball
to Rufio.

01:30:25.921 --> 01:30:28.221
That thing's unstoppable.

01:30:28.223 --> 01:30:29.356
You're right.

01:30:29.358 --> 01:30:31.224
We can't stop him,

01:30:31.226 --> 01:30:32.926
but Jimmy can.

01:30:33.961 --> 01:30:35.629
Now, you said
he reminds you

01:30:35.631 --> 01:30:37.364
of a horse on your farm?

01:30:40.701 --> 01:30:42.202
Break.
Break.

01:30:46.741 --> 01:30:48.775
Yo, this is crazy.

01:30:48.777 --> 01:30:51.711
Crazy enough that
it just might work.

01:30:51.713 --> 01:30:53.747
Down! Hey, guys,

01:30:53.749 --> 01:30:56.082
it's been a pleasure
kicking your ass.

01:30:57.286 --> 01:30:58.652
Set.

01:30:58.654 --> 01:30:59.719
Hut.

01:31:26.581 --> 01:31:28.482
Thad, what are
you doing?

01:31:28.484 --> 01:31:33.420
Oh, and the Panthers
get the ball with time
for just one more play.

01:31:33.422 --> 01:31:34.454
Unh!

01:31:37.926 --> 01:31:39.526
Yeah, Panthers!

01:31:39.528 --> 01:31:42.128
What the hell
was that, Thad?

01:31:42.130 --> 01:31:44.097
The voice...

01:31:44.099 --> 01:31:46.766
It just took over.

01:31:46.768 --> 01:31:49.703
What are you talking about,
you goddamn ogre?

01:31:49.705 --> 01:31:52.272
I got some thinking to do.

01:31:52.274 --> 01:31:53.607
What?

01:31:53.609 --> 01:31:54.774
No... Oh.

01:31:54.776 --> 01:31:58.612
Oh, what are
you talking about?

01:31:58.614 --> 01:32:00.280
You don't think.

01:32:00.282 --> 01:32:03.116
Where are you going?

01:32:03.118 --> 01:32:05.385
Thad!

01:32:05.387 --> 01:32:07.387
Thad!

01:32:07.389 --> 01:32:09.956
Thad!

01:32:09.958 --> 01:32:12.792
That's what I'm
talking about.
Yes.

01:32:12.794 --> 01:32:14.394
Jimmy, that was beautiful.
Okay. Here we go.

01:32:14.396 --> 01:32:16.863
We are going Triple Z.

01:32:16.865 --> 01:32:19.366
No. The safeties
are gonna see that
coming, okay?

01:32:19.368 --> 01:32:20.901
We run the Triple Z,

01:32:20.903 --> 01:32:23.570
but with a slight
alteration, all right?

01:32:23.572 --> 01:32:26.806
Chance, we're gonna
need something crazy
out of you, bud.

01:32:26.808 --> 01:32:28.141
Crazy enough that it
just might work.

01:32:28.143 --> 01:32:29.843
Please stop saying that.

01:32:29.845 --> 01:32:31.811
Right. Right.
Bring it in.

01:32:31.813 --> 01:32:33.480
Come on.

01:32:33.482 --> 01:32:35.081
Hey, stop playing grab-ass

01:32:35.083 --> 01:32:36.516
like a bunch of little boys.

01:32:36.518 --> 01:32:37.651
All right?

01:32:37.653 --> 01:32:38.685
Break!

01:32:38.687 --> 01:32:41.321
Don't mess up.
Get your man.

01:32:48.062 --> 01:32:49.296
Ready!

01:32:56.270 --> 01:32:57.571
Set! Hut!

01:32:59.874 --> 01:33:01.575
It's a fake!

01:33:34.809 --> 01:33:37.444
Uh, what happened? Huh?

01:33:37.446 --> 01:33:40.046
He disappeared
between the three
and the four-yard line.

01:33:40.048 --> 01:33:42.749
What type
of devilry is this?

01:33:44.286 --> 01:33:47.053
I love you, Son!

01:33:48.623 --> 01:33:50.957
I love you, too, Dad!

01:33:52.227 --> 01:33:53.760
Touchdown Panthers.

01:33:53.762 --> 01:33:54.894
Panthers win!

01:33:54.896 --> 01:33:58.298
Do you believe
in acts of God?

01:34:00.134 --> 01:34:01.735
Whoo!

01:34:01.737 --> 01:34:02.936
That's my boy.

01:34:02.938 --> 01:34:05.438
I always knew there
was something magical

01:34:05.440 --> 01:34:07.240
between three and four.

01:34:07.242 --> 01:34:08.608
Yes!

01:34:08.610 --> 01:34:09.743
Yeah!

01:34:15.249 --> 01:34:17.417
There's gotta be some rule!

01:34:17.419 --> 01:34:19.185
I got ghosted again!

01:34:22.324 --> 01:34:24.758
Dude, where did
these people come from?

01:34:24.760 --> 01:34:25.859
I don't know.

01:34:25.861 --> 01:34:27.861
Wait. What?

01:34:27.863 --> 01:34:30.263
Did you know we
could win $100,000?

01:34:30.265 --> 01:34:32.098
I had literally no idea.

01:34:32.100 --> 01:34:34.768
God, everybody
would have been
so much more invested.

01:34:34.770 --> 01:34:36.770
Whoo hoo hoo!

01:34:38.774 --> 01:34:40.774
Do you believe?

01:34:41.943 --> 01:34:43.209
Look at me.
He can't see.

01:34:43.211 --> 01:34:44.971
I'm Fat Albert.
He can't see.

01:34:46.714 --> 01:34:48.782
Yeah!

01:34:48.784 --> 01:34:50.650
How was that?

01:34:50.652 --> 01:34:52.786
Confronting your biggest fears

01:34:52.788 --> 01:34:55.488
in a climatic,
game-winning play.

01:34:55.490 --> 01:34:57.524
Never saw it coming.

01:35:04.031 --> 01:35:07.267
Now, that's
one shitty ceiling.

01:35:11.639 --> 01:35:13.306
Totally worth it.

01:35:13.308 --> 01:35:15.308
In my nine and a half
years of college,

01:35:15.310 --> 01:35:17.310
I thought
I'd seen it all.

01:35:17.312 --> 01:35:20.213
I witnessed a 2,000-cup
game of beer pong

01:35:20.215 --> 01:35:22.749
that claimed
the lives of seven bros.

01:35:22.751 --> 01:35:24.517
I've seen Frisbee
so ultimate,

01:35:24.519 --> 01:35:27.320
it threatened
the supremacy
of God himself.

01:35:27.322 --> 01:35:29.389
I've even seen
my colleague Dan here

01:35:29.391 --> 01:35:32.158
swallow two keys
of pure Bolivian heroin

01:35:32.160 --> 01:35:33.526
to make good on a series

01:35:33.528 --> 01:35:35.995
of increasingly
misguided
cockfighting bets,

01:35:35.997 --> 01:35:37.664
but I never
thought I'd witness

01:35:37.666 --> 01:35:41.401
such an amazing game
of intramural football.

01:35:42.504 --> 01:35:44.170
Right you are, Bill.

01:35:44.172 --> 01:35:45.505
Right you are.

01:35:46.675 --> 01:35:48.641
Yeah! Whoo!

01:35:50.544 --> 01:35:53.446
You all came
to our game!

01:35:53.448 --> 01:35:54.547
Yes!

01:38:40.180 --> 01:38:41.381
Oh, no! No!

01:38:41.383 --> 01:38:43.783
I want a boyfriend.

01:38:43.785 --> 01:38:45.852
I don't want to work.

01:38:45.854 --> 01:38:48.187
I want
to have a boyfriend.

01:38:48.189 --> 01:38:49.389
Oh, honey.

01:38:49.391 --> 01:38:52.125
That was my boyfriend!
Honey...

01:38:52.127 --> 01:38:55.194
Get me another boyfriend!

01:38:55.196 --> 01:38:56.796
Why don't you...

01:39:46.246 --> 01:39:47.613
Joining us now,

01:39:47.615 --> 01:39:49.983
the League Commissioner himself,

01:39:49.985 --> 01:39:52.986
Philip Bronson. Phil.

01:39:52.988 --> 01:39:54.654
What?

01:39:54.656 --> 01:39:57.690
You called me
and said there was
an electrical fire.

01:39:57.692 --> 01:39:59.592
What do you think about
the game so far, Comish?

01:39:59.594 --> 01:40:02.996
I'm an employee
of the university!

01:40:02.998 --> 01:40:05.631
There is no Comish.

01:40:05.633 --> 01:40:08.034
What's wrong with you guys?

01:40:08.036 --> 01:40:10.436
Comish, can we
get a ride home?

01:40:11.305 --> 01:40:17.203
