00:03.877 --> 00:05.964
I know I've been talking
about Bobby all morning,

00:05.965 --> 00:08.434
but another thing I love about Bobby is,

00:08.435 --> 00:10.369
he just gets me.

00:10.370 --> 00:13.272
Can he come get you right now?

00:13.273 --> 00:16.642
Last night, I gave Bobby
a little neck action.

00:16.643 --> 00:19.945
Neck action? Oh, racy!

00:19.946 --> 00:21.580
What's next, you gonna
lift up your skirt

00:21.581 --> 00:22.981
and show him your knees?

00:22.982 --> 00:25.884
Maybe.

00:25.885 --> 00:27.619
Hey, Caroline, wait up!

00:27.620 --> 00:28.821
Hide me, Max.

00:28.822 --> 00:30.289
Bobby hasn't seen me

00:30.290 --> 00:32.491
in my waitress uniform,
or my right profile.

00:32.491 --> 00:33.926
It hasn't been easy.

00:33.927 --> 00:35.523
What is wrong with our uniform?

00:35.524 --> 00:36.695
I call her Carrie

00:36.696 --> 00:38.430
'cause she's got a
little pig's blood on her

00:38.431 --> 00:41.567
and she can't be destroyed by fire.

00:41.568 --> 00:43.001
Morning, beautiful.

00:43.002 --> 00:44.336
I got you a macchiato.

00:44.337 --> 00:45.771
And a supportive round of applause

00:45.772 --> 00:47.553
when I told them the name was Caroline.

00:48.349 --> 00:50.409
Bobby, you are so sweet.

00:50.410 --> 00:52.778
This has skim milk, right?

00:52.779 --> 00:54.613
Oh, whatever!

00:54.614 --> 00:57.316
Uh, why are you using
Max as a human shield?

00:57.317 --> 00:59.451
Oh, don't worry. I'm used to it.

00:59.452 --> 01:02.087
It's how my mom robbed all
those Carvels in the '90s.

01:03.423 --> 01:04.489
I should get going.

01:04.491 --> 01:07.126
So... group hug?

01:07.127 --> 01:08.394
I'm still trying to figure out

01:08.395 --> 01:09.858
where to take you on our third date.

01:09.859 --> 01:11.697
I want it to be special.

01:11.698 --> 01:13.499
Also, I'm either caught on Max's button

01:13.500 --> 01:15.000
or she has a tiny, round penis.

01:18.036 --> 01:20.939
Might want to get that jacket tested.

01:20.940 --> 01:21.939
I'll see ya.

01:25.644 --> 01:27.312
Third date?

01:27.313 --> 01:29.882
You know what that means, don't you?

01:29.883 --> 01:31.550
Going by my last third date,

01:31.551 --> 01:32.751
he comes out of the closet,

01:32.752 --> 01:34.853
and we still date for two years.

01:34.854 --> 01:36.355
No!

01:36.356 --> 01:39.491
It means more neck action, just lower.

01:39.492 --> 01:42.394
Your between-legs neck.

01:42.395 --> 01:43.796
You're an adult, Max.

01:43.797 --> 01:46.565
It's called a noony-noo.

01:46.566 --> 01:49.334
And I thought sex was on the tenth date,

01:49.335 --> 01:52.371
after he accidentally
says, "I love you."

01:52.372 --> 01:54.940
Everybody knows the
third date means sex.

01:54.941 --> 01:57.176
And the fourth date means
he gets oddly distant

01:57.177 --> 01:59.812
and crazy busy at work.

02:03.516 --> 02:08.586
Subtitle sync and corrections by
<font color="#33FF00"><b>awaqeded</b></font> for <font color="#33FF00"><b>www.addic7ed.com.</b></font>

02:15.856 --> 02:17.556
Hey, Earl, how's it hanging?

02:17.557 --> 02:20.860
Lower than anyone will tell you, Max.

02:20.861 --> 02:24.562
I thought a snake followed me
into the bathroom this morning.

02:25.464 --> 02:26.832
What's up with you girls?

02:26.833 --> 02:29.802
Oh, Caroline is going on a third date.

02:29.803 --> 02:33.739
Oh, some between-legs
neck action is on.

02:33.740 --> 02:36.308
I am really not familiar
with this phrase.

02:36.309 --> 02:39.044
And I'm pretty sure this
whole "third date sex" rule

02:39.045 --> 02:40.513
isn't really a thing.

02:40.514 --> 02:43.482
Waiting until the third date for sex?

02:43.483 --> 02:45.985
What are you, a nun?

02:45.986 --> 02:48.653
Hey, everybody!

02:50.623 --> 02:52.858
Oh, all right.

02:52.859 --> 02:56.595
Don't talk to Baby
Barbara. We're in a fight.

02:56.596 --> 02:58.397
She thought that the Fifty Shades book

02:58.398 --> 03:00.698
was better than the movie.

03:02.568 --> 03:04.570
Sophie, have you ever heard
that you're supposed to

03:04.571 --> 03:06.639
have sex on the third date?

03:06.640 --> 03:09.842
Oh, that's a nun thing, right?

03:09.843 --> 03:11.744
I am so glad I don't have to deal with

03:11.745 --> 03:13.012
this kind of stuff anymore.

03:13.013 --> 03:15.881
I am officially retired from sex.

03:15.882 --> 03:18.017
Not sure how many of
you have heard the news,

03:18.018 --> 03:20.653
but not sure how many
of you read "Juggs."

03:20.654 --> 03:22.721
It got too political.

03:22.722 --> 03:24.989
That's why I turned to "Cans."

03:26.358 --> 03:27.893
Max, what are you talking about?

03:27.894 --> 03:29.595
You can't retire from sex.

03:29.596 --> 03:31.530
It's your thing, like Cheetos

03:31.531 --> 03:34.900
or zeroing in on
people's vulnerabilities.

03:34.901 --> 03:38.404
What? Sorry, I was distracted
by your nose pimple.

03:38.405 --> 03:40.973
I just feel like I need
to get out of the game.

03:40.974 --> 03:42.808
I had a good run, just ask

03:42.809 --> 03:45.044
literally anybody.

03:45.045 --> 03:47.046
But now it's your turn.

03:47.047 --> 03:49.014
Well, when one pair of legs closes,

03:49.015 --> 03:51.851
another one opens.

03:51.852 --> 03:55.888
Yeah, that's what Polish Oprah says.

03:55.889 --> 03:59.091
And you get hanged if
you disagree with her.

03:59.092 --> 04:00.192
Yep.

04:00.193 --> 04:02.261
Max, it doesn't take a genius...

04:02.262 --> 04:05.431
although my Facebook IQ
test says I qualify as one...

04:05.432 --> 04:07.733
to know that this whole retirement thing

04:07.734 --> 04:09.201
is about your breakup with Randy.

04:09.202 --> 04:13.239
It also said you had 362 friends.

04:13.240 --> 04:16.675
And we all know you barely have one.

04:16.676 --> 04:19.678
This has nothing to do with Randy.

04:19.678 --> 04:22.014
My sex throne is yours now.

04:22.015 --> 04:25.384
I would maybe put a towel down.

04:25.385 --> 04:26.886
Max, you can't get out of the game

04:26.887 --> 04:28.721
just when I'm getting back in.

04:28.722 --> 04:32.591
I wanted us to have sex together.

04:32.592 --> 04:35.493
Well, clear up that
nose zit, and we'll talk.

04:36.762 --> 04:39.598
Speaking of nose zits.

04:39.599 --> 04:42.401
Han, Max is about to give up sex.

04:42.402 --> 04:45.037
Tell her how bad life is without it.

04:45.038 --> 04:46.805
It's actually quite rich.

04:46.806 --> 04:49.041
I was just saying to Mossimo
down at the boccie court...

04:49.042 --> 04:51.210
Thank you! I rest my case.

04:51.211 --> 04:53.612
And tomorrow I'm taking golf lessons

04:53.613 --> 04:55.247
thanks to our community board.

04:55.248 --> 04:57.283
Apparently, I don't
meet the weight minimum

04:57.284 --> 04:59.652
for Krav Maga.

04:59.653 --> 05:01.954
You know what? I'll go with you.

05:01.955 --> 05:03.989
Retired people love golf.

05:03.990 --> 05:06.292
Just like you lesbians.

05:06.293 --> 05:08.127
Welcome to the club.

05:08.128 --> 05:11.130
Oh, look, we just made a golf pun.

05:11.131 --> 05:13.464
This is gonna be fun!

05:14.967 --> 05:17.669
I hope to God you
know what you're doing.

05:19.838 --> 05:22.675
If I am gonna have sex with
Bobby, I need new underwear.

05:22.676 --> 05:26.312
My current pair has more
holes than the plot of Arrival.

05:26.313 --> 05:27.980
So you came here?

05:27.981 --> 05:30.249
There's no lube aisle.

05:30.250 --> 05:32.518
None of the mannequins
are doing each other.

05:32.519 --> 05:34.620
This is a classy lingerie store,

05:34.621 --> 05:37.289
not Second-Hand Hose.

05:37.290 --> 05:38.857
I got kicked out of there.

05:38.858 --> 05:40.259
I ate a pair of edible underwear

05:40.260 --> 05:43.629
and I put the box back on the shelf.

05:43.630 --> 05:46.699
Ladies, I'm Rita. Welcome
to the Art of Seduction,

05:46.700 --> 05:48.256
where seduction begins with...

05:48.257 --> 05:49.168
A shot of tequila

05:49.169 --> 05:51.303
and ends with a shot of penicillin?

05:51.304 --> 05:53.138
Not what I was going to say at all.

05:53.139 --> 05:54.640
What can I help you ladies with?

05:54.641 --> 05:57.810
Uh, she has a third
date situation happening.

05:57.811 --> 06:01.780
Do you have anything that
says "Grand Reopening"?

06:01.781 --> 06:03.015
I want to be naughty.

06:03.016 --> 06:05.117
But I get cold.

06:05.118 --> 06:08.821
I found your shoelace section,
but where is the underwear?

06:08.822 --> 06:10.556
That is underwear,

06:10.557 --> 06:12.724
and you're holding it backwards.

06:15.194 --> 06:17.563
Oh, sure, I see it now.

06:17.564 --> 06:19.698
Let's go to Target.

06:19.699 --> 06:21.400
And, uh, what about you?

06:21.401 --> 06:22.501
Any third dates coming up?

06:22.502 --> 06:23.902
Actually, no.

06:23.903 --> 06:26.705
I am retired, sexually.

06:26.706 --> 06:30.643
Took the sock off the door
and now I'm wearing it.

06:30.644 --> 06:32.878
Come on, Max, we both know you're not

06:32.879 --> 06:34.046
really retired from sex.

06:34.047 --> 06:38.050
We are two young, sexual beings.

06:38.051 --> 06:40.418
Where are you supposed to wear this?

06:42.554 --> 06:45.524
That's a purse.

06:45.525 --> 06:48.394
Uh, if I'm not retired,

06:48.395 --> 06:50.596
then why did Larry Flynt
send me a gold watch,

06:50.597 --> 06:54.033
thanking me for my 20 years of cervix.

06:54.034 --> 06:56.335
How about this teddy?

06:56.336 --> 06:58.404
I just need simple underwear.

06:58.405 --> 07:01.240
I was a nice presentation
for my noony-noo.

07:01.241 --> 07:03.008
Look, it doesn't matter what you wear.

07:03.009 --> 07:05.203
With a body like yours,
it's not gonna be on long.

07:05.204 --> 07:07.746
Ah, see, Max? She likes my body.

07:07.747 --> 07:11.350
Tastes have changed since
I got out of the game.

07:11.351 --> 07:13.552
And these panties are
great to bounce in.

07:13.553 --> 07:15.587
The frills on the back
really accentuate the twerk

07:15.588 --> 07:17.690
when you're doing the Swingin' Linda.

07:22.027 --> 07:23.295
Linda

07:23.296 --> 07:26.598
must have a bunch of back problems.

07:26.599 --> 07:29.368
Oh, my God. Do I have to do that?

07:29.369 --> 07:31.236
Whatever happened to lying down?

07:31.237 --> 07:33.372
That's a guy's job now.

07:33.373 --> 07:36.041
Skanks like us ruined that for you.

07:36.042 --> 07:38.410
She's not wrong, but

07:38.411 --> 07:40.379
I teach a burlesque
class around the corner.

07:40.380 --> 07:42.247
You should come.

07:42.248 --> 07:44.641
It can, uh, really help you
get in touch with your body.

07:44.642 --> 07:45.918
Oh, it's okay, I'm already

07:45.919 --> 07:47.453
very in touch with my body.

07:47.454 --> 07:50.089
Oh, yeah. She's real in touch.

07:50.090 --> 07:53.292
This one's keeping Duracell in business.

08:00.601 --> 08:03.780
Max, I wish you had gotten
something at the lingerie store.

08:03.781 --> 08:07.784
That saddle looked
really good under you.

08:07.785 --> 08:09.085
Most things do.

08:09.086 --> 08:10.787
Did! I'm retired!

08:10.788 --> 08:14.357
We both know your
retirement isn't gonna last.

08:14.358 --> 08:15.959
You're like The Rolling Stones,

08:15.960 --> 08:18.194
but with more of your own blood.

08:18.195 --> 08:20.463
Oh...

08:20.464 --> 08:21.797
really?

08:25.635 --> 08:27.937
Do I look like someone who will

08:27.938 --> 08:30.272
ever have sex again?

08:33.277 --> 08:35.177
Clothes jinx!

08:37.746 --> 08:41.583
It's like looking in a funhouse mirror.

08:41.585 --> 08:44.254
Without the fun.

08:44.255 --> 08:47.624
I just came by to say our
tee time is tomorrow at 1:00.

08:47.625 --> 08:49.626
We're in a foursome with Mitch and Bill.

08:49.627 --> 08:52.996
Whatever you do, don't mention
the Gulf War in front of Mitch.

08:52.997 --> 08:56.966
Even when you say
"golf," really hit the O.

08:56.967 --> 08:59.168
Max, come on, don't you want to unretire

08:59.169 --> 09:01.137
and have a real foursome again?

09:01.138 --> 09:02.906
Like you used to, on my bed,

09:02.907 --> 09:04.407
while I'm trying to read?

09:04.408 --> 09:06.576
I like this sexless existence.

09:06.577 --> 09:08.511
I don't know what you've
been complaining about.

09:08.512 --> 09:11.014
And besides, I can
finally let myself go,

09:11.015 --> 09:12.949
hygenital-ly.

09:12.950 --> 09:14.918
So because you got hurt by Randy,

09:14.919 --> 09:16.319
you're never gonna have sex again?

09:16.320 --> 09:18.588
No, I'm never having sex again

09:18.589 --> 09:21.189
because I have no idea how
to take off these pants.

09:24.260 --> 09:25.962
- Hey.
- Whoa... Bobby!

09:25.963 --> 09:28.464
What are you doing here?

09:28.465 --> 09:31.266
I couldn't wait till
tomorrow night to see you.

09:31.267 --> 09:33.570
I got this from a gay wedding;
they were throwing them out

09:33.571 --> 09:35.872
'cause they were the wrong shade of red.

09:35.873 --> 09:38.942
My God, this is just like The Bachelor.

09:38.943 --> 09:41.710
Except I'm not getting
HPV from a lagoon.

09:43.513 --> 09:45.515
Hey, don't worry, Max.
I didn't forget you.

09:45.516 --> 09:47.450
My scratch-offs!

09:47.451 --> 09:49.619
The grooms were throwing
those out instead of rice.

09:49.620 --> 09:53.990
Well, that's going on my Pinterest.

09:53.991 --> 09:57.527
So tomorrow night's our big third date.

09:57.528 --> 09:59.996
That's what people keep telling me.

09:59.997 --> 10:02.131
I've got something real special planned.

10:02.132 --> 10:03.499
It's exotic.

10:03.500 --> 10:05.134
I think you'll be very impressed.

10:05.135 --> 10:08.071
Oh, I'm sure I will be,

10:08.072 --> 10:10.039
but it takes me a little while,

10:10.040 --> 10:13.376
and I'm quiet when I am.

10:13.377 --> 10:15.011
Hey, don't worry.

10:15.012 --> 10:17.814
I'll do all the work.

10:17.815 --> 10:20.483
Well, I'll pitch in a little.

10:20.484 --> 10:22.117
It's gonna be big.

10:24.554 --> 10:26.221
See you tomorrow night.

10:30.059 --> 10:33.363
Big and exotic? What is it, a parrot?

10:33.364 --> 10:36.766
If it's a cockatiel,
then I'm back in the game.

10:36.767 --> 10:39.434
At least I have that
really sexy underwear.

10:40.870 --> 10:43.773
Hey, girls. I heard
the word "underwear."

10:43.774 --> 10:45.708
Hey.

10:45.709 --> 10:48.511
Some old lady left
her panties back here.

10:48.512 --> 10:51.381
Oleg, those aren't old lady panties,

10:51.382 --> 10:53.249
they're mine.

10:53.250 --> 10:56.219
Are you bringing them to an old lady?

10:56.220 --> 11:00.390
Perhaps this gentleman's wife?

11:00.391 --> 11:02.258
Oleg, these are sexy.

11:02.259 --> 11:04.227
What makes you a panty expert?

11:04.228 --> 11:06.529
Besides my official license plate

11:06.530 --> 11:08.097
from the state of arousal

11:08.098 --> 11:12.635
and my degree from Idu U?

11:12.636 --> 11:14.603
Nothing.

11:15.805 --> 11:18.141
I have to go to that burlesque class.

11:18.142 --> 11:19.442
I don't know, you should see if

11:19.443 --> 11:21.910
they have night classes at Idu U.

11:24.280 --> 11:27.150
How are you gonna dance
in those golf clothes?

11:27.151 --> 11:28.317
How are you gonna dance

11:28.318 --> 11:30.319
looking like a slutty poodle?

11:30.320 --> 11:32.455
Let's just pick out our props.

11:32.456 --> 11:34.957
I've been sanitizing
for this all morning.

11:34.958 --> 11:38.094
I was once dropped into a
lake in a trunk just like this.

11:38.095 --> 11:41.297
Those dock goons did not
expect to see this gal again.

11:41.298 --> 11:44.100
Ooh, feather boa!

11:44.101 --> 11:45.668
I haven't worn something with feathers

11:45.669 --> 11:48.771
since that pigeon flew into our fan.

11:48.772 --> 11:50.406
I brought this from home.

11:50.407 --> 11:52.575
I got it on my third Carnival Cruise.

11:52.576 --> 11:54.644
Oh, let her have it!

11:54.645 --> 11:56.145
Girl's going on a third date.

11:56.146 --> 11:59.415
Ooh, that's a gay first date.

11:59.416 --> 12:02.118
My first date was a
Hall & Oates concert.

12:02.119 --> 12:03.986
Yes, I'm old.

12:03.987 --> 12:05.521
Welcome, everyone!

12:05.522 --> 12:08.357
Let's get started.
It's time to get sexy!

12:08.358 --> 12:10.626
Yep, according to my "Hustler" watch,

12:10.627 --> 12:13.096
it's 11:69.

12:13.097 --> 12:14.629
Can't be right. Feels earlier.

12:16.132 --> 12:17.934
Hey, girls. Oh.

12:17.935 --> 12:19.135
I was screaming at you

12:19.136 --> 12:20.937
for three blocks to wait up.

12:20.938 --> 12:25.341
But then sidewalk Caroline
turned out to be a lamppost.

12:25.342 --> 12:27.043
Sophie, what are you doing here?

12:27.044 --> 12:29.946
Well, I saw the card on
the board in the diner,

12:29.947 --> 12:32.849
and I wanted to spice
up Oleg and my sex life.

12:32.850 --> 12:34.617
Yeah, I mean, we haven't
done it in front of

12:34.618 --> 12:37.186
The Today Show window in weeks.

12:37.187 --> 12:38.688
I can't believe they didn't

12:38.689 --> 12:41.991
cut away when Matt Lauer threw up.

12:41.992 --> 12:43.359
Last time I did it, you could

12:43.360 --> 12:45.661
still bring cocaine in your carry-on.

12:45.662 --> 12:48.364
In this class, we are going to go deep

12:48.365 --> 12:50.666
and unleash our sexual goddesses.

12:50.667 --> 12:52.869
Mine got me kicked out of the army.

12:52.870 --> 12:55.338
They asked; I told.

12:55.339 --> 12:57.640
Let's dive in!

12:57.641 --> 12:59.776
Everybody get behind your chairs.

12:59.777 --> 13:02.120
I'm gonna show you the routine
and then I'll break it down.

13:02.121 --> 13:03.079
I'm so excited.

13:03.080 --> 13:04.547
I'm about to lose control

13:04.548 --> 13:06.215
and I think I like it!

13:27.504 --> 13:30.173
I'll just play golf with you.

13:30.174 --> 13:33.709
Uh, I play golf to
get away from my wife.

13:33.710 --> 13:35.211
Well, I'm exhausted.

13:35.212 --> 13:38.681
I need a nap.

13:38.682 --> 13:41.884
After I dance is when we
usually lose most of the class.

13:41.885 --> 13:44.353
Now, before I teach
you the actual moves,

13:44.354 --> 13:45.688
I want you to just feel your body

13:45.689 --> 13:47.356
and let it go.

13:47.357 --> 13:48.500
Who wants to give it a shot?

13:48.501 --> 13:50.026
Oh, I do! I do!

13:50.027 --> 13:53.462
I want to put the "ass" in "class."

13:53.463 --> 13:55.064
Sophie, if I wanted to see your ass,

15:15.646 --> 15:16.846
Ooh, now that I can dance,

15:16.847 --> 15:19.214
I'm sassy too.

15:25.958 --> 15:27.092
Let's tease. And tease.

15:27.093 --> 15:29.261
Did I do that? Did I do that?

15:29.262 --> 15:31.096
And tease. And tease.

15:31.097 --> 15:33.132
I did do that. I did do that.

15:33.133 --> 15:35.100

15:35.101 --> 15:36.602
And pump. And grind.

15:36.603 --> 15:38.003
Wink.

15:38.004 --> 15:40.639
That's how I got to this country.

15:40.640 --> 15:43.909
Except I was also rowing.

15:45.011 --> 15:46.679
Why aren't you participating?

15:46.680 --> 15:48.514
Like I told that guy
in sweatpants last week,

15:48.515 --> 15:50.115
you can't just sit here and watch.

15:50.116 --> 15:51.951
Well, unlike that guy,

15:51.952 --> 15:54.653
my days of sexy moves are behind me.

15:54.654 --> 15:57.074
From now on, the only
balls I'll be smacking

15:57.075 --> 16:00.077
are on the golf course.

16:00.078 --> 16:02.212
You're really gonna
give up on who you are

16:02.213 --> 16:03.314
because of Randy?

16:03.315 --> 16:04.648
She went through a breakup,

16:04.649 --> 16:05.883
and she swore off sex,

16:05.884 --> 16:07.818
and I'm worried maybe deodorant.

16:07.819 --> 16:10.287
Oh, yeah, that's

16:10.288 --> 16:14.525
probably my bag of dirty
diapers in my purse.

16:14.526 --> 16:17.594
I'm putting them in my baby book.

16:17.595 --> 16:19.663
This is what this class is all about.

16:19.664 --> 16:21.565
Taking all that pain and anger

16:21.566 --> 16:23.100
and making it sexy.

16:23.101 --> 16:25.469
I thought this was about
making my booty clap.

16:25.470 --> 16:27.871
We'll get there, Gavin.

16:27.872 --> 16:31.508
So tell me about this guy, Randy.

16:31.509 --> 16:32.843
Uh, there's nothing to say.

16:32.844 --> 16:33.844
It's not about him.

16:33.845 --> 16:35.179
Are you sure?

16:35.180 --> 16:36.013
Did he

16:36.014 --> 16:37.781
bring you down low?

16:37.782 --> 16:40.718
Oh, sure he did. Real low.

16:40.719 --> 16:41.719
Shake you up?

16:41.720 --> 16:43.087
All shook up.

16:43.088 --> 16:46.857
Hey, get your ass out
of my face, razor hips.

16:46.858 --> 16:47.858
Did he

16:47.859 --> 16:49.093
spin you around

16:49.094 --> 16:51.562
and slide right out of your life?

16:51.563 --> 16:52.996
Like a greasy McNugget!

16:52.997 --> 16:53.997
Show me that nugget.

16:53.998 --> 16:55.099
I would, but I can't

16:55.100 --> 16:56.767
take these pants off.

16:56.768 --> 16:58.402
Max, come on.

16:58.403 --> 17:01.271
You can't let one bad
experience ruin everything.

17:01.272 --> 17:04.007
Otherwise, I'd never
use our bath mat again.

17:04.008 --> 17:05.909
It's hot for no reason.

17:05.910 --> 17:08.811

Well, if you'll excuse me,

17:57.529 --> 18:00.464

20:35.836 --> 20:37.770
Why would I see your
underwear on our third date?

20:37.771 --> 20:39.606
Doesn't that happen on the tenth?

20:39.607 --> 20:41.608
That's what I said!

20:41.609 --> 20:45.111
You people are animals!

20:45.112 --> 20:47.347
But what was all that talk about

20:47.348 --> 20:49.482
our date being big and exotic?

20:49.483 --> 20:51.584
I was gonna take you
to this Moroccan place.

20:51.585 --> 20:54.954
They don't have chairs.
We sit on pillows.

20:54.955 --> 20:57.790
That is exotic.

20:57.791 --> 20:59.959
You might want to hold off on the sex.

20:59.960 --> 21:01.327
You two might be related.

21:05.565 --> 21:13.506
