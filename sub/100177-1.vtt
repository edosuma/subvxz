-[woman]  Loyal readers,
-[keys clacking]

00:40.206 --> 00:42.500
my favorite holiday
is just around the corner.

00:43.126 --> 00:44.544
Christmas means joy,

00:44.794 --> 00:47.422
excitement, family, love and lights.

00:48.465 --> 00:51.509
It also means my first year
as Queen of Aldovia

00:51.718 --> 00:53.428
is nearly under my belt.

00:53.803 --> 00:55.597
And just...  [inhales]  Wow!

00:56.056 --> 00:57.474
What a year.

00:58.892 --> 01:01.019
-[merry classical music playing]
-[applause]

01:02.937 --> 01:06.107
Royal life has a way
of transforming everything.

01:11.112 --> 01:12.280
As the year began,

01:12.447 --> 01:14.657
Richard and I enjoyed a magical honeymoon.

01:18.244 --> 01:19.079
Once home,

01:19.162 --> 01:22.665
our revised new Aldovia initiative
continued to grow.

01:23.124 --> 01:24.959
And that's how we'll fund the tech center.

01:25.043 --> 01:26.044
And the new hospital.

01:26.836 --> 01:28.963
[Amber]
And quickly began paying dividends.

01:29.631 --> 01:30.465
[snip]

01:33.051 --> 01:36.679
As did my efforts to learn
about Aldovia's history and families.

01:37.847 --> 01:39.849

at functions like Royal State dinners.

01:42.310 --> 01:44.312
[merry classical music continues]

01:45.647 --> 01:48.233
And the people of Aldovia
are fully embracing

their Queen Amber of New York.

01:54.656 --> 01:56.658

even busier.

02:11.297 --> 02:12.966
[applause, shuttering continues]

02:15.635 --> 02:17.262
Have you chosen the baby's name?

02:17.720 --> 02:18.638
[together] No.

02:18.721 --> 02:20.765
-[laughter]
-Are you expecting a boy or a girl?

02:20.849 --> 02:23.518
-We haven't found out yet.
-We're waiting to be surprised.

02:23.601 --> 02:26.938
You've updated Aldovia's line
of succession to include females.

02:27.021 --> 02:28.398
Does that mean it's a girl?

02:28.523 --> 02:31.067
It means that we are hoping
to bring Aldovia

02:31.151 --> 02:34.362
into the 21st Century culturally,
just as the new Aldovia initiative

02:34.445 --> 02:35.822
-has done economically.
-[clamoring]

02:35.905 --> 02:37.782
Will you at least tell us
the baby's due date?

02:38.116 --> 02:39.117
January the 11th.

02:39.450 --> 02:40.660
Will you be taking time off?

02:40.910 --> 02:42.954
-[Amber] Yes.
-Starting in two days time,

02:43.037 --> 02:46.416
following the centennial treaty signing
with the Kingdom of Penglia.

02:46.499 --> 02:48.293
Our last official duty of the year.

02:49.252 --> 02:53.590
Now are there any policy questions,
economic queries, foreign affairs?

[camera shutters]

02:56.217 --> 02:57.051
No.

02:57.135 --> 02:59.470
About the baby.
Do you have any names to share?

02:59.637 --> 03:01.764
-[together] No.

03:01.931 --> 03:03.975
["Deck the Halls" classical instrumentals]

03:11.691 --> 03:13.818
Have you truly not chosen the name?

03:13.985 --> 03:15.236
You won't give up, will you?

03:15.320 --> 03:18.323
Well, I'd be delighted to finally know
what names you're considering.

03:18.406 --> 03:19.866
We're not telling anyone, Mother.

03:20.366 --> 03:21.701
We're all family here.

03:22.076 --> 03:23.244
What Richard said.

03:25.246 --> 03:28.499
-For a girl, I say Khaleesi.
-Hermione is lovely as well.

03:28.666 --> 03:31.085
Claudette is a family name
I'm very fond of

03:31.169 --> 03:32.378
or Claude for a boy.

03:32.462 --> 03:35.632
Well, if it is a boy, I won't be offended
if you decided to name him Simon,

03:35.757 --> 03:37.425
or Simone for a girl, obviously.

03:37.550 --> 03:40.803
All lovely names,
we will take them under advisement.

03:41.346 --> 03:44.641
Your Majesty, in a few weeks' time
when the baby arrives,

03:45.099 --> 03:46.893
the surprise will be all the sweeter.

03:46.976 --> 03:49.354
You always put things in perspective.

03:49.979 --> 03:52.941
I just hope I'm half as beautiful
as Amber is when I become pregnant.

03:53.107 --> 03:55.610
That's an unsettling thought
to put into your mother's head.

03:55.693 --> 03:58.613
Not nearly as unsettling
as your continued presence.

03:58.696 --> 03:59.656
[light laughter]

03:59.822 --> 04:00.949
Your Majesties,

04:01.741 --> 04:02.784
you have a guest.

04:03.201 --> 04:04.786
I wonder who on Earth that could be.

04:05.787 --> 04:07.121

-Melissa!

-I feel like a watermelon.
-[scoffs]

04:13.962 --> 04:17.173
But it's so great that you could
surprise me early for the baby shower.

04:17.339 --> 04:21.678
I am early,
but that's not actually the surprise.

04:21.928 --> 04:24.597
Simon's invited me
to stay through Christmas. [chuckles]

04:24.847 --> 04:26.933
A fabulous idea, if I may say so.

04:27.725 --> 04:28.977
Wow, great! [laughs]

04:29.102 --> 04:30.561
It's so good to see you.

04:30.645 --> 04:34.941
Yeah. [laughs]
You too. So, are you daddy ready?

-Getting there, [exhales] I think.
-[Melissa giggles]

-She should've told us.
-She wanted to surprise you.

04:47.120 --> 04:48.496
She knows how you feel about Simon.

-[sighs] Well, I don't trust him.
-No, neither do I.

04:50.665 --> 04:51.958
He has behaved all year.

04:52.041 --> 04:54.043
In the hope
that we'll give him an official position.

04:54.127 --> 04:54.961
Which we haven't.

04:55.044 --> 04:56.921
[stammers] I just don't want
Melissa to get hurt.

04:57.005 --> 04:57.839
Let them be.

04:58.131 --> 05:00.049
We have more important issues
to attend to.

05:00.925 --> 05:02.343
Like my birth plan.

that classical music
makes your baby smarter.

all the way until little Rudy's birth.

No, you're far more valuable.

08:08.905 --> 08:11.991
I want you both to have the best
of everything, including sleigh rides.

08:12.074 --> 08:13.075
I've been thinking,

08:13.159 --> 08:16.037
and I want this baby
to have a normal life,

I was riding a subway by myself
when I was ten, and I ate diner food.

to make sure I ate my vegetables.

-So did I.

of normal together.

-No boarding school.
-No boarding school.

08:38.267 --> 08:40.186
[inhales] But no subway riding, either.

Thank you for making the time.

Well, this is the last of the time
you will get of our Queen,

09:17.390 --> 09:20.893
for the rest of the year
will be dedicated exclusively

09:21.102 --> 09:24.438
to the preparations for the birth
of the royal baby.

Of course.

Mr. Little.

09:28.568 --> 09:30.319
The centennial treaty

09:30.653 --> 09:34.615
renews an ancient truce
between Aldovia and Penglia

09:34.782 --> 09:38.119
that dates back to a war 600 years ago.

09:38.244 --> 09:40.997
That was the war
over Silk Road trading routes, right?

09:41.163 --> 09:43.249
You've studied your history, Queen Amber.

-[whooshing]
-[royal trumpeting]

09:45.293 --> 09:49.338

and brutal war with no end in sight.

- Finally, on Christmas Eve 1419,

and Prince Jun of Penglia,

09:57.638 --> 09:59.724
inspired by the season of peace
and goodwill,

10:00.266 --> 10:02.560
found a way to end the conflict.

10:09.483 --> 10:10.735
Just before midnight,

10:11.402 --> 10:14.488
on that fateful Christmas Eve 1419,

10:14.864 --> 10:18.117
the truce was declared
and the treaty signed.

10:27.627 --> 10:30.796
To honor the peace and friendship
between our nations,

10:31.088 --> 10:33.758
the treaty has been ceremonially renewed

10:33.841 --> 10:36.552
every 100 years since, without fail.

-[mellow flute instrumentals continue]
-The artistry is incredible.

10:39.639 --> 10:41.098
[Richard] It's a treasured artifact.

10:42.224 --> 10:44.477
It's been under our protection since 1919.

10:44.560 --> 10:47.104
And after the signing,
it goes back to Penglia

10:47.188 --> 10:48.314
for the next hundred years.

10:48.648 --> 10:51.484
It's beautiful,
with the signatures of every king.

10:51.942 --> 10:54.445
[inhales] I'll be the first queen
to sign it.

10:54.528 --> 10:55.613
You will, indeed.

this treaty dates back
to the 15th Century.

11:06.957 --> 11:08.918
We'll have to proceed
very carefully, Amber.

11:09.502 --> 11:11.712
The Penglians are our closest allies but,

11:12.046 --> 11:14.632
in many respects,
they are quite traditional.

11:14.715 --> 11:17.093
-[Amber chuckles]
-An attitude personified

11:17.510 --> 11:19.887
by the Queen of Penglia, Queen Ming.

11:19.970 --> 11:21.472
Compared to Queen Ming,

11:21.597 --> 11:25.059
even Mrs. Averill
comes off as rather carefree.

11:25.142 --> 11:25.976
[chuckling]

11:26.060 --> 11:27.853
[Mrs. Averill] I have my carefree moments.

11:28.437 --> 11:30.189
I had one last Sunday. [chuckles]

11:30.523 --> 11:33.693
I love a challenge.
I can't wait to meet Queen Ming.

11:34.485 --> 11:36.070
[booming drums]

11:38.239 --> 11:39.073
[hollow tap]

11:40.282 --> 11:42.493
[majestic instrumentals]

11:56.257 --> 11:58.259
[siren blaring]

12:00.302 --> 12:02.138
[tires treading water]

12:05.766 --> 12:07.143
They shall be here momentarily.

12:07.226 --> 12:09.729
[Mrs. Averill] Now come on, everybody.
Move into place, quickly.

12:14.900 --> 12:16.652
[whoosh of cars]

12:19.864 --> 12:21.031
[indistinct chatter]

12:26.120 --> 12:28.414
[royal horn salute]

12:29.874 --> 12:30.875
[indistinct chatter]

12:31.625 --> 12:32.793
[cars approaching]

12:43.637 --> 12:44.555
[engine idles]

12:45.264 --> 12:49.477
Once they exit, meet them in the center.
King Richard will give a formal greeting.

12:53.564 --> 12:55.649
[triumphant instrumentals]

13:33.020 --> 13:35.022
[triumphant instrumentals fading]

13:40.820 --> 13:42.071
Welcome to Aldovia.

13:42.154 --> 13:43.572
-[crowd gasps]
-[Amber chuckles]

13:44.198 --> 13:45.324
[throats clearing]

13:46.283 --> 13:48.285
A most hearty welcome.

13:48.869 --> 13:53.415
We're here to celebrate a hand clasp
on a battlefield 600 years ago.

13:53.833 --> 13:56.043
That changed the fate of both our nations.

13:57.419 --> 13:58.254
[sighs of relief]

13:58.337 --> 14:00.005
-[cameras shutter]
-[chuckles] King Richard,

14:00.089 --> 14:01.674
so glad to finally meet you in person.

14:01.757 --> 14:03.259
Good to see you too, King Tai.

14:03.342 --> 14:05.469
May I introduce my wife, Queen Amber.

14:05.553 --> 14:08.639
An honor.
You're as lovely and charming as they say.

14:09.306 --> 14:11.183
My wife, Queen Ming of Penglia.

14:11.267 --> 14:13.561
-Queen Ming.
-I'm most pleased to be here.

14:14.019 --> 14:17.940
And to finally lay eyes
on the famous Queen Amber of New York.

14:19.483 --> 14:21.527
Wonderful to meet you, Queen Ming.

14:22.069 --> 14:22.903
And you.

14:24.029 --> 14:25.114
I'm Amber, hi.

14:26.156 --> 14:27.491
Lynn is our attaché.

14:28.284 --> 14:29.118
Oh.

14:29.660 --> 14:30.536
Lynn?

14:30.995 --> 14:32.162
Fantastic!

14:32.329 --> 14:33.622
[playful instrumentals]

14:35.541 --> 14:36.375
[Simon laughs]

14:41.881 --> 14:43.299
[fanciful instrumentals]

14:44.675 --> 14:46.385
[indistinct conversations]

14:49.430 --> 14:50.347
[Mrs. Averill chuckles]

15:01.942 --> 15:03.277
[indistinct chatter]

15:08.198 --> 15:09.158
Beautiful.

15:09.742 --> 15:12.119
No one does Christmas
like the Aldovians.

15:12.244 --> 15:14.038
Thank you. We do our best.

15:14.246 --> 15:16.707
If Emily had her way,
we'd have a tree in every room.

15:16.832 --> 15:18.542
Actually, I believe you do.

15:18.626 --> 15:19.710
Indeed, Tom.

15:19.793 --> 15:22.296
-We have quite a bit of mistletoe too.
-[Tom gulps]

15:23.464 --> 15:25.341
[Simon, laughing] That's spectacular.

15:25.466 --> 15:27.134
[Lynn, Melissa laughing]

15:27.343 --> 15:29.136
So, how do you two know each other?

15:29.219 --> 15:30.846
We studied together, Oxford.

15:30.930 --> 15:34.391
I studied. Simon... caroused.

15:34.475 --> 15:36.226
I may have enjoyed
the occasional night out,

15:36.310 --> 15:37.728
but I'm not the one whose picture...

15:37.811 --> 15:39.897
-Hey, hey, hey!
-...is hanging in the King's Arms Pub.

15:39.980 --> 15:42.107
-[Lynn and Simon laugh]
-[glasses clink]

15:42.232 --> 15:43.525
[Lynn and Simon steadily exhale]

15:43.609 --> 15:44.818
[Lynn chuckles]

15:45.444 --> 15:47.029
[man] Red for you, your Highness.

15:47.112 --> 15:49.323
And sparkling water for you, Your Majesty.

15:49.406 --> 15:50.658
Thank you, Mr Zabala.

15:51.283 --> 15:53.827
It appears you've adapted comfortably
to your new role.

15:54.078 --> 15:55.204
I like to think so.

15:55.329 --> 15:57.331
Not to say
there haven't been growing pains.

15:57.539 --> 16:00.292
What with the Belgravians here,
in Aldovia, as well,

16:00.542 --> 16:03.462
it seems royals
marrying outside of noble classes

16:03.545 --> 16:05.005
has become quite fashionable.

16:05.881 --> 16:07.091
And now your first child

16:07.174 --> 16:09.218
-on the way. Congratulations.
-[Amber chuckles]

16:09.635 --> 16:11.303
Providing your kingdom with an heir

16:11.387 --> 16:13.973
is historically a Queen's utmost duty.

16:14.515 --> 16:16.684
[stammers] Oh, I don't see it
as a duty at all.

16:16.767 --> 16:19.478
Richard and I are simply excited
to start our family.

16:20.312 --> 16:21.897
You have three children of your own?

16:22.064 --> 16:25.818
Yes. Harry is 13.
Vivian and Amanda are ten.

16:26.068 --> 16:28.654
Twins? I can't even imagine. [laughs]

16:29.196 --> 16:30.030
[Amber inhales]

16:31.699 --> 16:35.953
I have to admit, I was excited
to finally meet the playboy prince.

16:36.036 --> 16:37.913
-[Richard chuckles]
-I enjoyed living vicariously

16:37.997 --> 16:39.832
through your exploits in the press.

16:39.915 --> 16:41.500
It's all greatly exaggerated.

16:42.042 --> 16:44.128
I was actually hoping to talk
some business with you.

16:44.420 --> 16:46.839
Business? Quite honestly,

16:47.172 --> 16:49.383
I prefer to leave that tedium to Lynn.

16:49.800 --> 16:50.676
[glasses clink]

16:52.136 --> 16:54.763
Congratulations on your new position,
very impressive.

16:54.847 --> 16:57.266
It's a start,
but I soon hope to be accomplishing more.

16:57.349 --> 16:59.018
Ambitious as ever. [playfully scoffs]

16:59.101 --> 17:00.352
What's your role at the palace?

17:00.519 --> 17:03.313
Cousin to the King,
but you know me, working the angles.

17:03.397 --> 17:05.065
-Oh, you always do. [laughs]
-[Simon laughs]

17:05.148 --> 17:07.151
[phone ringing]

17:07.233 --> 17:09.694
[scoffs] Pardon me, got to take this.
Angles of my own.

17:09.778 --> 17:11.655
[Richard] Mm... [chuckles]

17:11.739 --> 17:13.615
[inhales] She's a live wire.

17:14.532 --> 17:15.451
Enjoying yourself?

17:15.784 --> 17:18.287
-[stammers] Of course, yeah.
-[Richard exhales in relief]

17:19.747 --> 17:23.041
Are you familiar
with Aldovia's modernization efforts?

17:23.500 --> 17:26.753
I'm familiar
with all aspects of Aldovia's policy.

17:27.253 --> 17:30.132
Given its success,
I spoke with Richard and

17:30.841 --> 17:34.178
we feel that you and I
should add our signatures to the treaty.

17:35.054 --> 17:38.599
You wish to modernize
our 600 year old tradition?

17:39.058 --> 17:41.727
We, the Queens,
could bring the tradition up to date.

17:43.020 --> 17:45.564
History isn't made
by those who follow rules.

17:46.982 --> 17:48.067
[Mr. Little] Your Majesties.

17:48.400 --> 17:50.944
May I announce the arrival of the CEO

17:51.028 --> 17:54.490
and the Chief Designer
from S & A Events International.

17:54.573 --> 17:55.824
[curious instrumentals]

18:00.621 --> 18:03.415
-Your Majesties.
-It's a pleasure to be here.

18:03.832 --> 18:05.167
Andy, hi!

18:05.959 --> 18:06.835
Sahil!

18:06.919 --> 18:08.504
[Andy] Wow, look at you.

18:08.837 --> 18:10.464
You've never looked more beautiful.

18:10.714 --> 18:11.590
[Amber exhales]

18:11.715 --> 18:14.510
So this is what you've been doing?
Your secret project?

18:14.593 --> 18:18.555
Consider Andrew and myself
early Christmas gifts.

18:19.556 --> 18:21.809
Weddings were too small a niche
for such a big talent.

18:21.892 --> 18:24.311
We rebranded
and expanded Sahil's business.

18:24.895 --> 18:26.980
I was happy
to give Andrew the opportunity.

18:27.272 --> 18:30.025
Design genius meets management expertise.

18:30.901 --> 18:33.237
Mrs. Averill engaged us
to make sure that you had

18:33.320 --> 18:36.406
the most spectacular
royal baby shower of all time.

18:36.990 --> 18:39.118
-You deserve it.
-Thanks.

18:39.660 --> 18:43.163
May I also offer our service,
free of charge,

18:43.622 --> 18:46.291
to the elevation
of tomorrow's treaty signing?

18:46.625 --> 18:47.459
Elevation?

18:47.918 --> 18:51.588
I have seen the artifact.
It's a bit tacky, no? [laughs]

18:52.381 --> 18:54.383
It's a priceless work of art.

18:56.552 --> 18:58.679
We will be standing by if you need us.

18:58.971 --> 18:59.805
[Amber chuckles]

19:00.055 --> 19:00.889
Great.

19:03.600 --> 19:05.602
[wind whirring]

19:06.061 --> 19:07.146
[Amber] Next question.

19:07.813 --> 19:10.274
During labor I would like
to spend the first stage

19:10.357 --> 19:14.069
lying down, standing up, walking around,
in the shower or in the tub?

19:14.153 --> 19:15.154
Lying down.

19:15.279 --> 19:17.614
Walking around. New York, born and raised.

19:18.073 --> 19:20.242
Never realized labour
came in multiple choice.

19:20.325 --> 19:21.160
[button clicks]

19:21.243 --> 19:22.369
[page rustling]

19:22.536 --> 19:24.872
Testing. Testing. Can you hear me?

19:25.998 --> 19:26.999
I can hear you.

19:28.750 --> 19:29.793
Let's test it for real.

19:31.670 --> 19:34.631
[Richard mimics the whoosh
of a flying plane]

19:34.756 --> 19:36.091
Extraordinary.

19:36.592 --> 19:38.302
-Are you seeing this?
-Yeah.

19:38.427 --> 19:39.595
[playful instrumentals]

19:40.137 --> 19:41.513
[Richard]  Whoa...

19:41.722 --> 19:44.308
-[Amber sighs in frustration]
-Can you still see me?

19:44.892 --> 19:46.268
-[Amber chuckles]
-Amber, hello?

19:46.351 --> 19:47.769
This is unbelievable.

19:48.478 --> 19:50.147
You're right. This  is  amazing.

19:50.606 --> 19:52.191
Should we try from the nursery?

19:52.816 --> 19:55.819
Now transmitting from the nursery.

19:55.903 --> 19:57.946
-Can you hear me?
-[Amber playful groans over monitor]

19:58.113 --> 20:00.282
-Amber, hello? Are you there?
-[whimpering over monitor]

20:00.407 --> 20:01.533
I need a little help.

20:01.617 --> 20:04.453
-Is that crying? Amber?
-[whimpering continues]

20:04.745 --> 20:06.663
[Amber laughs, inhales sharply]

20:06.830 --> 20:08.624
-[exhales]
-What is it?

20:08.916 --> 20:10.792
I can't even reach my own slippers.

20:11.376 --> 20:12.920
[peaceful instrumentals]

20:15.797 --> 20:16.632
Allow me.

20:23.513 --> 20:24.389
Perfect fit.

20:25.557 --> 20:27.392
Cinderella was a bit more graceful.

20:28.185 --> 20:29.728
But nowhere near as beautiful.

20:30.187 --> 20:31.230
[swelling instrumentals]

20:34.608 --> 20:35.817
[kissing sound]

20:36.443 --> 20:38.904
-[Amber sighs]
-[wind whipping in distance]

20:38.987 --> 20:40.989
[dramatic instrumentals]

20:42.282 --> 20:43.867
[wind whirring]

20:52.668 --> 20:53.877
[faint whirring wind]

20:54.169 --> 20:55.337
[door creaks open]

20:55.796 --> 20:57.798
[curious instrumentals]

20:59.549 --> 21:01.468
-[door creaks closed]
-[ominous instrumentals]

21:06.223 --> 21:08.225
[blissful instrumentals]

21:15.399 --> 21:17.526
[Queen Ming]
This storm could spell disaster.

21:18.777 --> 21:22.072
Where's Lynn?
I asked for an update four minutes ago.

21:22.531 --> 21:24.950
Apologies, Queen Ming.
I was speaking to the pilot.

21:25.284 --> 21:26.118
And?

21:26.201 --> 21:27.995
The storm brought the country
to a standstill.

21:28.453 --> 21:29.746
All flights have been canceled.

21:30.539 --> 21:32.708
How would this affect the treaty signing?

21:32.791 --> 21:35.127
The Aldovians wish to proceed
the ceremony as scheduled.

21:35.919 --> 21:36.753
I agree.

21:37.337 --> 21:38.171
Very well.

21:38.588 --> 21:40.590
Find us a way home directly afterwards.

21:41.216 --> 21:43.010
Our children expect us back.

21:43.176 --> 21:44.011
Yes.

21:45.887 --> 21:47.514
[majestic instrumentals]

21:52.936 --> 21:55.022
[Queen Helena] Such a shame
there are so few guests

21:55.105 --> 21:56.565
to witness this beautiful event.

21:58.900 --> 22:03.280
Yes, I'm afraid no one's been able
to travel anywhere today, Your Majesty.

22:07.367 --> 22:08.452
Your Majesties.

22:08.618 --> 22:11.955
As expected, the Penglians
have officially rejected

22:12.039 --> 22:14.333
-either queen signing the treaty.
-[Richard inhales deeply]

22:15.459 --> 22:17.461
[exhales slowly] I'm sorry.

22:18.545 --> 22:20.130
In a few minutes, this will all be over

22:20.213 --> 22:22.257
and then we can focus
on what's most important.

22:22.716 --> 22:23.884
You and the baby.

22:25.552 --> 22:27.512
There's a little too much red.

22:27.929 --> 22:29.890
I think they can do
with a little bit more blue,

22:29.973 --> 22:30.974
-to be honest.
-Yeah.

22:31.099 --> 22:32.642
[Sahil] I'm thinking royal blue.

22:33.060 --> 22:34.770
Mm... Yeah. Could work.

22:36.688 --> 22:38.440
In honor of the sacred treaty,

22:39.024 --> 22:43.528
signed on the battlefield
on Christmas Eve in the year 1419,

22:43.779 --> 22:45.280
the monarchy of Aldovia

22:45.364 --> 22:49.201
welcomes King Tai
and Queen Ming of Penglia.

22:49.368 --> 22:51.536
[royal procession music playing]

23:00.128 --> 23:01.713
No. No, no, no.

23:08.345 --> 23:10.931
It is my great honor and privilege

23:11.515 --> 23:16.144
to preside over the seventh signing
of the sacred truce between our realms.

23:16.603 --> 23:18.855
The entire Kingdom of Aldovia

23:19.439 --> 23:22.275
heartily embraces our alliance
with Penglia.

23:22.943 --> 23:25.862
What began as a handshake on Christmas Eve

23:26.279 --> 23:29.157
has evolved into an ever-growing bond

23:29.616 --> 23:33.703
represented by our invaluable,
ever-expanding

23:33.870 --> 23:35.288
precious treaty.

23:36.164 --> 23:39.292
Mr. Little, let the signing begin.

23:41.044 --> 23:42.546
[royal salute instrumentals]

23:52.305 --> 23:53.473
[drum roll]

23:54.516 --> 23:56.059
-[booming effect]
-[gasping]

23:56.351 --> 23:57.519
[suspenseful instrumentals]

24:06.486 --> 24:07.904
How is this possible?

24:08.447 --> 24:10.365
Where's the treaty?
It's supposed to be there.

24:10.449 --> 24:11.658
[curious instrumentals]

24:12.159 --> 24:12.993
We do apologize.

24:13.076 --> 24:16.121
I'm sure we can get this little mix-up
straightened out right away.

24:16.496 --> 24:18.582
Well this is certainly embarrassing.

24:20.834 --> 24:23.920
If we don't sort this out,
we'll all end up in the dungeon.

24:24.337 --> 24:25.297
Indeed.

24:25.839 --> 24:28.967
Perhaps now it can be replaced
with something more palatable.

24:30.552 --> 24:32.012
There must be an explanation.

24:32.095 --> 24:33.763
Does anyone have any idea what's going on?

24:33.930 --> 24:35.974
The treaty was there last night
when we checked.

24:36.057 --> 24:37.976
-I can confirm.
-And now it's vanished.

24:38.143 --> 24:41.605
I've been saying that we should update
the security protocols ever since...

24:42.689 --> 24:44.566
well, you infiltrated the palace.

24:44.649 --> 24:47.194
But no one has come or gone
since the blizzard.

24:47.277 --> 24:49.279
So the treaty must still be in the palace.

24:49.362 --> 24:50.822
Along with whoever took it.

24:52.616 --> 24:54.618
-[hushed] What do we do now?
-[hushed] I don't know--

24:54.701 --> 24:55.535
[Richard] Simon.

24:58.163 --> 24:59.539
[sighs] We need your help.

24:59.915 --> 25:00.874
You're kidding.

25:01.625 --> 25:05.170
Well, I'd be delighted.
What can I do for my king and queen?

25:05.253 --> 25:07.881
Find a way to occupy our guests
while we locate the treaty.

25:08.507 --> 25:11.468
[hushed] It's okay, we'll make sure--
I'll make sure everything's sorted.

25:11.551 --> 25:12.802
And how am I to do that?

25:13.011 --> 25:15.305
You're friends with Lynn.
Keep them entertained.

25:15.388 --> 25:17.015
Lynn's easy to entertain.

25:17.474 --> 25:18.892
Not so sure about the others.

25:19.309 --> 25:20.727
[hushed] One thing is for certain.

25:21.478 --> 25:24.773
Just stick with Simon and make sure
he doesn't do anything Simon-like.

25:24.856 --> 25:26.274
I'll be your eyes and ears.

25:28.068 --> 25:29.986
I know what might be a bit of fun.

25:30.737 --> 25:31.905
[cheery instrumentals]

25:32.155 --> 25:33.823
[Christmas bells jingle]

25:37.702 --> 25:38.537
[tree thuds]

25:38.745 --> 25:40.580
Is this some kind of game?

25:40.664 --> 25:44.000
Top of the tree,
a classic Aldovian Christmas game.

25:44.501 --> 25:47.212
Wow, I haven't played this
since I was a kid. [chuckles]

25:47.295 --> 25:48.630
Shockingly good idea, Simon.

25:49.089 --> 25:50.257
Two teams compete,

25:50.340 --> 25:53.552
the goal being
to decorate your side of the tree first.

25:53.635 --> 25:56.304
The team that places the star
on top of the tree wins.

25:56.471 --> 26:00.058
You want us to play a children's game
in the midst of this scandal?

26:00.141 --> 26:04.229
Well, it's an unfortunate delay,
it's not really a scandal, yet.

26:04.396 --> 26:06.815
Simon has a great talent for games.

26:06.940 --> 26:10.151
-He's definitely talented at many things.
-[Simon laughs uneasily]

26:11.111 --> 26:13.613
Ornaments are awarded
for answering questions

26:13.697 --> 26:16.700
about famous royal traditions and legends.

26:16.783 --> 26:17.993
Count me in.

26:18.743 --> 26:20.745
Our children would enjoy this.

26:20.996 --> 26:22.998
I'll go and inform them about the delay.

26:23.081 --> 26:23.957
Of course.

26:24.583 --> 26:26.960
It's a pity though,
we should have even teams.

26:27.043 --> 26:28.962
Well, I'm happy to sit out if it helps.

26:29.045 --> 26:32.591
I'm not exactly a whiz
at royal traditions yet.

26:32.799 --> 26:36.219
I'll join King Tai.
I embrace any opportunity to beat Simon.

26:36.303 --> 26:38.680
-I like your spirit, Princess.
-[chair creaks]

26:38.805 --> 26:40.682
Well, guess that makes it... [exhales]

26:42.100 --> 26:43.977
you and me. [chuckles]

26:44.436 --> 26:45.520
[Richard playfully scoffs]

26:49.232 --> 26:51.151
-Would you like to start?
-Yes, please.

26:52.193 --> 26:53.236
Any luck?

26:54.279 --> 26:55.363
Not yet. [sighs]

26:55.572 --> 26:57.574
We know the treaty was here last night.

26:57.782 --> 26:59.784
We know that nobody's entered
or left the palace.

26:59.868 --> 27:01.578
Are you proposing
we make a list of suspects?

27:01.995 --> 27:03.747
Investigative journalism 101.

27:04.289 --> 27:06.166
The treaty didn't fly away on its own.

27:06.666 --> 27:08.835
Did you notice the look
that Simon and Lynn exchanged

27:08.918 --> 27:10.086
when the treaty went missing?

27:10.503 --> 27:13.214
And Sahil called it tacky.
I wouldn't put it past him.

27:13.798 --> 27:17.344
Who in this palace had the means,
the opportunity, the motive?

27:17.719 --> 27:19.512
-Did you take it?
-No.

27:19.971 --> 27:21.890
Neither did I. That's two down.

27:21.973 --> 27:22.974
Very funny.

27:23.516 --> 27:25.644
-[cheery instrumentals continue]
-[hollow rattling]

27:25.935 --> 27:26.895
[card scrapes]

27:27.646 --> 27:28.480
Lynn.

27:29.105 --> 27:30.565
[scoffs] This is an easy one.

27:31.066 --> 27:32.651
In the legend "Princess Froon,"

27:32.984 --> 27:34.736
Grendel's pet is what animal?

27:34.819 --> 27:37.072
[scoffs] Even I know this one,
from your Christmas pageant.

27:37.155 --> 27:38.573
-Don't you dare say.
-Turtle!

27:39.407 --> 27:42.619
-Yes, well played. One more and we win.
-[Lynn squeals in delight]

27:43.828 --> 27:44.996
Tweet, tweet, tweet.

27:46.915 --> 27:49.042
-That is beautiful.
-[Lynn laughs]

27:49.125 --> 27:51.419
Do you see that, Melissa, what she made?
It's amazing.

27:51.503 --> 27:52.712
I can make you one.

27:53.338 --> 27:55.632
Actually, I need to get some air.

27:56.841 --> 27:58.426
Melissa! Melissa...

27:58.677 --> 27:59.803
Wait!

28:01.805 --> 28:03.515
We should probably check on Ming.

28:03.973 --> 28:06.267
A pity, Princess Emily, we would have won.

28:07.185 --> 28:08.019
Sorry.

28:11.773 --> 28:13.483
-[Emily sighs]
-[mellow instrumentals]

28:13.566 --> 28:16.069
This game was a favorite
in my family, too.

28:18.655 --> 28:19.864
Final question.

28:20.824 --> 28:23.993
Who was Aldovia's greatest king
and father?

28:24.869 --> 28:26.287
That isn't a real question.

28:27.372 --> 28:28.665
But you know the answer.

28:29.999 --> 28:30.834
My father.

28:30.917 --> 28:32.001
[Mr. Little exhales]

28:32.252 --> 28:33.086
The star.

28:34.587 --> 28:35.422
You win.

28:36.005 --> 28:37.048
Will you do the honors?

28:37.841 --> 28:38.800
As you wish.

28:44.848 --> 28:45.724
[Mr. Little gasps]

28:48.351 --> 28:50.019
[wind rushing]

28:50.603 --> 28:52.355
-[indistinct conversation]
-Hey!

28:53.648 --> 28:54.691
Where are you going?

28:54.774 --> 28:57.193
Simon and I need some alone time.

28:57.360 --> 28:59.654
Melissa suggested a walk in the snow.

28:59.821 --> 29:01.072
What about the Penglians?

29:01.865 --> 29:05.452
Well Emily's more than capable
and my priority is Melissa.

29:06.536 --> 29:07.787
Mel, can we talk a sec?

29:08.204 --> 29:09.038
Yeah, sure.

29:09.330 --> 29:10.915
I'll see about clearing a path.

29:11.499 --> 29:12.876
-[kissing sound]
-My hero!

29:13.001 --> 29:14.419
[Simon and Melissa chuckle]

29:14.502 --> 29:16.087
[whimsical instrumentals]

29:16.254 --> 29:17.088
What's up?

29:17.547 --> 29:19.382
Well, you and Simon, for one thing.

29:19.883 --> 29:21.426
I never realized you were so close.

29:21.843 --> 29:24.053
We talk for hours every night.

29:24.512 --> 29:26.097
He's really smart,

29:26.598 --> 29:29.893
funny, super cute
and really misunderstood.

29:29.976 --> 29:31.227
Misunderstood?

29:31.728 --> 29:34.230
Mel, all your bad boys
have left you heartbroken.

29:34.522 --> 29:36.149
He's more than just a bad boy.

29:36.316 --> 29:37.484
He cares about me.

29:37.984 --> 29:40.028
It's starting to feel real, you know?

29:40.153 --> 29:42.530
We are just worried about his intentions.

29:42.822 --> 29:44.324
Have you seen the way he looks at Lynn?

29:44.908 --> 29:46.868
He swears Lynn is just a friend.

29:47.118 --> 29:49.746
I don't know,
sometimes I get a little insecure,

29:49.829 --> 29:51.831
out of my depth with royals, you get that.

29:51.915 --> 29:54.000
Yeah, but you don't know Simon like we do.

29:54.083 --> 29:55.543
And you don't know Simon like I do.

29:56.961 --> 29:58.838
I appreciate you looking out for me,

29:58.922 --> 30:00.632
-but Simon and I...
-[dramatic instrumentals]

30:00.757 --> 30:01.633
we're in love.

30:02.634 --> 30:03.468
Wow!

30:04.093 --> 30:07.680
Not just like a lot or heavily infatuated?

30:08.097 --> 30:09.599
I want it to work.

30:11.684 --> 30:12.685
[Amber sighs deeply]

30:12.894 --> 30:14.270
[clicks tongue] I hear you.

30:18.358 --> 30:19.234
[page rustles]

30:21.277 --> 30:22.195
[footsteps approaching]

30:24.280 --> 30:25.698
Has the treaty been found?

30:25.782 --> 30:28.618
It pains me to say no, Your Majesty.

30:28.785 --> 30:30.787
After our initial survey,

30:30.912 --> 30:33.498
we can assume it's nowhere obvious.

30:33.998 --> 30:36.459
Your Majesty, please, be assured

30:36.543 --> 30:38.962
no one will rest until it's located.

30:39.045 --> 30:40.129
Thank you.

30:40.296 --> 30:42.966
Because, according to the treaty's terms,

30:43.341 --> 30:46.219
if it's not renewed by midnight
on Christmas Eve,

30:46.719 --> 30:49.639
Aldovia and Penglia
technically return to a state of war.

30:50.265 --> 30:53.434
Should be interesting,
as neither country has a standing army.

30:53.518 --> 30:55.436
Emily, I thought you were with our guests.

30:55.520 --> 30:58.982
Simon had to end the game abruptly.
They've returned to their rooms.

30:59.524 --> 31:03.027
This situation is just so inelegant.

31:04.362 --> 31:06.698
Please, continue to search.

31:06.948 --> 31:07.907
Your Majesty.

31:11.494 --> 31:12.745
Is this about the treaty?

31:13.830 --> 31:15.164
Mother, did you read this?

31:15.832 --> 31:18.418
"If there comes a day
the sacred truce is broken,

31:18.543 --> 31:21.045
the Kingdom disrupting the peace
shall suffer a dreadful fate:

31:22.005 --> 31:24.007
upon the firstborn a beshrew."

31:24.883 --> 31:25.842
What's a beshrew?

31:26.217 --> 31:27.719
[scoffs] It's a curse.

31:28.386 --> 31:30.388
People believed in things like that
back then.

31:30.972 --> 31:32.015
How did it work?

31:32.724 --> 31:35.268
A sorceress would conjure a spell

31:35.351 --> 31:37.854
to ensure
that the two kingdoms upheld the treaty.

31:38.146 --> 31:40.565
So, if we don't sign the treaty
by Christmas Eve,

31:41.316 --> 31:44.485
there'll be a curse
on the firstborn child?

31:45.528 --> 31:46.613
[suspenseful instrumentals]

31:46.821 --> 31:48.406
That's Amber and Richard's baby.

31:48.948 --> 31:51.784
Sorcery fell out of favor centuries ago.

31:52.702 --> 31:55.371
Emily, we're not going to bother anyone
with this nonsense.

31:55.455 --> 31:56.915
But what if it isn't nonsense?

31:58.416 --> 31:59.918
[Amber sighs] Ow!

32:00.585 --> 32:01.419
[Richard] What is it?

32:01.961 --> 32:03.504
Baby's kicking a lot.

32:04.297 --> 32:05.173
Amazing.

32:05.632 --> 32:06.799
Little striker in there.

32:07.008 --> 32:09.218
More likely upset
about my chat with Melissa.

32:09.302 --> 32:10.553
Does Simon have an alibi?

32:10.678 --> 32:14.098
No idea, but she thinks
he's a great guy, says they're in love.

32:14.849 --> 32:16.017
Love is blind.

32:17.101 --> 32:19.312
Perhaps sleuthing while pregnant
isn't the best idea.

32:19.395 --> 32:21.648
I may be expecting and Queen,

32:21.731 --> 32:23.524
but I'm still a journalist.

32:23.608 --> 32:25.944
And right now,
my investigation needs your help.

32:27.946 --> 32:29.405

[light scratching]

I'm in the zone, designing.

-Andrew!

32:46.464 --> 32:47.298
Andrew--

32:47.715 --> 32:48.758
Oh.

32:48.841 --> 32:49.884
Your Majesty.

32:50.718 --> 32:52.011
Please, come-- come in.

32:52.095 --> 32:53.513
Sorry to disturb you, Sahil.

32:53.596 --> 32:56.140
I have a design question
about the nursery.

32:56.224 --> 32:57.100
Do you have a moment?

32:57.183 --> 32:59.227
Now? [stammers] Of course, Your Majesty.

32:59.310 --> 33:00.269
I appreciate this.

33:00.353 --> 33:02.897
It's about the best location
for the crib, given the layout.

33:03.022 --> 33:05.400
Spatial flow is absolutely crucial.

33:05.650 --> 33:09.904
I have studied the Aztecs, Mongols
and Zulus to arrive at my own theories.

33:10.113 --> 33:12.323
-I should get my tape measure.
-No, no, no, no!

33:12.407 --> 33:15.034
[stammering] I mean I have
a royal tape measure waiting for us.

33:15.118 --> 33:15.952
Oh!

33:16.619 --> 33:20.248
I am envisioning monochrome
with geometric prints.

Hi, Eddie. [stammers] Andrew.

34:05.626 --> 34:06.461
-Amber.
-[exhales]

34:06.544 --> 34:07.503
Is Sahil here?

34:07.670 --> 34:10.089
-[stammering] No, I was just--
-Just...

34:11.090 --> 34:12.759
[sighs] Helping with the search.

34:14.135 --> 34:15.844
Sahil called the treaty tacky.

34:15.969 --> 34:17.804
I went too far. Don't be mad at me.

34:17.889 --> 34:18.973
[laughs] Mad?

34:19.223 --> 34:21.391
Look, I work with the guy daily.

34:21.641 --> 34:23.186
I get it. He's opinionated.

34:23.603 --> 34:25.855
It was a lead. We follow leads, remember?

34:26.355 --> 34:29.025
I do, it's just we have
a multi-million dollar business now

34:29.108 --> 34:30.275
and Sahil would never risk it.

34:30.650 --> 34:32.487
Multi-million dollars, really?

34:32.612 --> 34:34.655
Yeah. So if you wanna write a story,
write about us.

34:34.989 --> 34:36.949
-Like a puff piece?
-Exactly.

34:37.033 --> 34:37.867
[Amber chuckles]

34:37.949 --> 34:39.659
-After the baby, of course.
-Of course.

34:46.333 --> 34:48.960
Thanks to your little ruse,
the last hour's felt like a month.

34:49.128 --> 34:51.714
-Once Sahil gets in the zone--
-He didn't take it.

34:52.380 --> 34:53.216
You're right,

34:53.466 --> 34:55.842
I don't need to focus
on this missing treaty.

34:56.552 --> 34:57.970
[Richard] No, you absolutely don't.

34:58.638 --> 35:00.264
Actually, you do.

35:00.681 --> 35:01.641
Emily.

35:01.808 --> 35:02.850
[mellow instrumentals]

35:03.017 --> 35:05.353
I'm not meant to tell you this
because it's probably rubbish.

35:06.104 --> 35:06.938
But...

35:07.271 --> 35:10.858
a curse will befall the King and Queen
responsible for breaking the treaty.

35:11.275 --> 35:13.236
Seriously? A curse?

35:13.361 --> 35:16.072
Concocted by a sorceress
to ensure the treaty wasn't broken.

35:16.155 --> 35:17.949
Sorcery. Hardly a cause for concern.

35:18.074 --> 35:21.369
If the treaty isn't signed in time,
by midnight Christmas Eve,

35:21.828 --> 35:22.870
it takes effect.

35:22.954 --> 35:25.373
Why are you putting stock
in this nonsense?

35:27.125 --> 35:28.751
It's a curse on your firstborn.

35:29.335 --> 35:30.545
On this baby?

35:31.420 --> 35:32.630
Our baby.

35:32.922 --> 35:34.173
According to the history book.

35:34.257 --> 35:36.467
The chance of this being real
is infinitesimal.

35:36.551 --> 35:39.220
I don't care if it's one in a billion,
I'm not risking it.

35:40.054 --> 35:41.639
We need to find this treaty.

35:42.807 --> 35:44.851
[woman over PA]  Attention, flight 1225

35:44.934 --> 35:47.228

-to Aldovia is still canceled.

35:47.311 --> 35:50.356
Eh, no clue
when they'll start letting flights in,

35:51.023 --> 35:53.025
but I'll be on the first one
as soon as they do.

35:53.442 --> 35:54.986
How about you guys, how you doing?

35:55.153 --> 35:57.321
Honestly, disaster on all fronts.

35:57.405 --> 35:58.990
Melissa is in love with Simon.

35:59.115 --> 36:01.993
We have to cancel tomorrow's baby shower,
the treaty is missing

36:02.201 --> 36:04.829
and if we don't find it
by midnight on Christmas Eve,

36:05.037 --> 36:06.372
our baby is cursed.

36:06.747 --> 36:08.833
Hold on,
you're gonna have to explain that one.

36:09.000 --> 36:11.169
-It's a long story.
-Emphasis on story,

36:11.711 --> 36:13.546
and we have until Christmas Eve
to sort it out.

36:13.629 --> 36:15.715
-Tomorrow's only the 23rd.
-[Rudy exhales steadily]

36:15.882 --> 36:18.801
Well, I don't know much
about this supernatural stuff,

36:19.302 --> 36:21.220
but go easy on Melissa, huh?

36:21.429 --> 36:23.806
Love makes people do funny things.

36:24.098 --> 36:27.226
You gave up New York slices and bagels
for meat jelly.

36:27.643 --> 36:29.604
Oh! Could you please bring me some bagels?

36:29.687 --> 36:30.938
[Rudy chuckles]

36:31.189 --> 36:32.064
You got it.

36:32.273 --> 36:34.817
Now, why'd you cancel your baby shower?

36:34.901 --> 36:37.361
No one can get here. The storm.

36:37.445 --> 36:40.531
There's plenty of people in the palace.
Have it anyway.

36:40.615 --> 36:42.408
It just doesn't feel like the right time.

36:42.700 --> 36:44.911
From what you're saying,
sounds like a little hope and joy

36:44.994 --> 36:46.537
is just what the palace needs.

36:46.621 --> 36:47.830
Have the shower.

A curse upon the firstborn,

upon the firstborn...

37:18.486 --> 37:21.656
[Amber] The Royal Scandal
of the Fathers of the Silk Road Treaty.

37:21.822 --> 37:22.907
Royal scandal?

37:24.367 --> 37:26.869
Did you know there was a love triangle

37:26.953 --> 37:31.457
between Prince Claude and Prince Jun
over Claude's newlywed, Princess Jocelyn?

37:31.624 --> 37:34.794
I believe they taught us that
at boarding school.

37:35.920 --> 37:37.004
Oh my gosh!

37:37.088 --> 37:39.423
Soon after the royal treaty was signed,

37:39.715 --> 37:42.969
Prince Claude was poisoned.
Many believed Prince Jun did it.

37:43.928 --> 37:46.764
The house of Devon, Claude's family,
fell out of power

37:47.598 --> 37:49.892
and Claude's descendants swore vengeance.

37:50.810 --> 37:51.644
Devon.

37:52.812 --> 37:54.522
Why does that name sound familiar?

37:55.147 --> 37:56.399
[Richard snores]

37:58.651 --> 38:01.279
[Amber takes a deep breath,
steadily exhales]

You're up early, my dear.

38:16.836 --> 38:18.170
Oh, I couldn't sleep.

38:18.462 --> 38:19.839
Baby had a restless night.

38:20.631 --> 38:23.384
One day, you'll look back
on all the sleepless nights

38:23.884 --> 38:24.719
and you'll realize

38:24.802 --> 38:27.013
-they're amongst your sweetest memories.
-[Amber chuckles]

38:28.723 --> 38:30.141
It's a big change, isn't it?

38:30.516 --> 38:31.851
It's the greatest adventure,

38:31.934 --> 38:34.061
but your life
will never be the same again.

38:34.145 --> 38:35.187
[Amber scoffs playfully]

38:35.730 --> 38:38.899
There are so many things
that I wish I could ask my mom.

38:39.900 --> 38:42.194
Amber, never forget that she's right here.

38:43.112 --> 38:45.656
Her spirit's in you and your baby.

38:46.782 --> 38:49.076
She gave you good instincts

38:49.618 --> 38:51.704
and, through your baby, she'll guide you,

38:52.496 --> 38:53.456
always.

38:55.541 --> 38:57.043
I'm so grateful I have you.

38:57.543 --> 38:58.502
I'm here.

38:58.961 --> 38:59.837
For anything.

39:02.131 --> 39:05.551
When you were expecting Emily,
did you try hypnobirthing?

39:06.135 --> 39:07.178
Hypnobirthing?

39:08.179 --> 39:09.930
What on earth is hypnobirthing?

39:10.014 --> 39:11.265
[Amber and Queen Helena laugh]

39:11.432 --> 39:13.726
[Dr. Magoro through laptop]
Fear causes the body to tense up

39:13.809 --> 39:17.355
and pain in childbirth
becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.

39:17.438 --> 39:20.024
So you're saying
no pain is really an option?

39:20.274 --> 39:21.984
Language is powerful

39:22.276 --> 39:24.820
and we want to have
a positive view of birth.

39:25.279 --> 39:28.157
For instance, instead of contractions,

39:28.449 --> 39:30.993
we'll call them surges.

39:31.327 --> 39:33.245
-Surges?
-[stammers] Like a surge of energy?

39:33.329 --> 39:36.665
Exactly. Your body is powerful.

39:36.791 --> 39:39.710
And during labor, every surge you feel

39:39.794 --> 39:42.254
is a wave of relaxation,

39:42.463 --> 39:44.423
pleasure and love.

39:44.840 --> 39:45.674
[Richard] Hm.

39:45.800 --> 39:47.218
Lucky you, men don't get those.

39:47.426 --> 39:51.097
I want you both to lie back
and close your eyes.

39:51.514 --> 39:54.725
I'm going to lead you
into a guided imagery meditation.

39:54.809 --> 39:57.019

39:57.103 --> 39:59.897
Imagine a surge,

40:00.898 --> 40:05.820
relaxation, pleasure, love.

40:07.780 --> 40:10.658
Feel its pulse.

40:11.617 --> 40:12.952
[Richard sighs heavily]

40:16.330 --> 40:18.541
We thought we'd be home by now, too.

40:18.874 --> 40:21.585
No, you may not peek at your presents.

40:22.503 --> 40:24.338
[laughs] We'll be home
as soon as we're able.

40:25.297 --> 40:26.132
Love you!

40:26.841 --> 40:27.675
Bye, now.

40:29.427 --> 40:32.555
[sighs] This predicament must be resolved.

40:32.805 --> 40:36.016
If only the children were stuck here
with us, wouldn't be so bad.

40:36.517 --> 40:38.477
No place is more Christmassy.

40:39.103 --> 40:42.148
Leave it to you to find light
in any situation.

40:42.231 --> 40:44.316
I assume that's why you keep me around.

40:44.442 --> 40:45.443
[laughter]

40:45.526 --> 40:47.945
Still, I'd like to find a way home.

40:48.404 --> 40:50.739
If we don't stay to sign the truce treaty,

40:51.073 --> 40:54.368
our kingdoms technically return
to a state of war.

40:54.910 --> 40:59.457
Of course, a war
that would be fought by lawyers. [sighs]

40:59.582 --> 41:00.541
Just a thought.

41:01.584 --> 41:04.712
What if the Aldovians orchestrated this
on purpose?

41:05.754 --> 41:07.798
They want the treaty signed
just as much as we do.

41:08.299 --> 41:11.343
Unless it's a way for them to force
an unfair renegotiation of terms.

41:11.594 --> 41:13.721
Renegotiation under duress?

41:14.305 --> 41:15.139
No.

41:15.598 --> 41:17.391
[Mr. Zabala] Good day, Your Majesties.

41:18.434 --> 41:20.019
Forgive me, am I interrupting?

41:20.102 --> 41:21.020
Not at all.

41:21.437 --> 41:24.440

with the compliments and best wishes

[sighs] I never knew how complicated
preparing for a baby would be.

45:19.299 --> 45:21.760
Did it take you a long time
to feel comfortable with fatherhood?

45:21.885 --> 45:25.556
Only until the birth,
then it was automatic. [chuckles]

45:26.056 --> 45:28.517
I never experienced
feeling that type of love before.

45:29.059 --> 45:32.312
When the most dire problem in the kingdom
pales to a scuffed knee,

45:32.938 --> 45:34.440

-[classical "We Three Kings" playing]
-I read more of that history book today

45:40.863 --> 45:41.822
and you know what?

45:42.364 --> 45:44.950
This isn't the first time
the treaty's disappeared.

45:45.075 --> 45:45.909
It's not?

45:45.993 --> 45:48.203
Two hundred years ago,
there was another incident,

45:48.287 --> 45:49.413
here in Aldovia.

45:49.872 --> 45:52.541
The thief made off with the treaty,
but was caught red-handed.

45:52.624 --> 45:54.668
Spent the rest of his years
locked in a dungeon.

45:55.252 --> 45:59.047
Princess Emily, please don't fret,
I have never heard of such a legend.

45:59.131 --> 46:00.841
And nor have I.

46:01.675 --> 46:02.509
I have.

46:04.303 --> 46:07.473
I started working for your grandparents
when I was just a lad.

46:08.265 --> 46:10.809
They told me that the ghost
of that wretched thief

46:10.893 --> 46:13.312
still roamed
the darkest depths of the dungeon,

46:13.395 --> 46:15.481
searching for his coveted prize.

46:15.773 --> 46:18.650
-I've never heard such nonsense.
-Neither have I, Your Majesty.

46:18.734 --> 46:22.070
-[Queen Helena laughs heartily]
-I was of the same mind, Your Majesty.

46:22.446 --> 46:24.072
Then, one Christmas Eve,

46:24.156 --> 46:25.699
despite all the warnings,

46:26.325 --> 46:27.576
I snuck into the dungeon.

46:27.951 --> 46:28.786
And?

46:29.328 --> 46:31.079
I heard a tortured moaning.

46:31.747 --> 46:33.791
Then I felt a chilling breeze...

46:34.541 --> 46:35.375
and then...

46:36.627 --> 46:37.461
I ran.

46:40.422 --> 46:42.341
Okay, so this is my favorite.

46:43.050 --> 46:46.345
-Aw! [chuckles] He's so cute!
-I know.

Queen Helena said that it was
Richard's favorite childhood toy.

Well it's not your doing
the treaty disappeared, right?

47:22.756 --> 47:23.757
Well, it's not that.

47:24.716 --> 47:27.678
I know that Ming was uneasy about the idea
of her and Amber signing it.

47:27.928 --> 47:29.471
I'm happy for Ming to sign,

47:29.930 --> 47:32.891
but she's worried what our people
will think if she seeks credit,

47:32.975 --> 47:34.977
despite all she does for Penglia.

47:35.060 --> 47:36.478
Aldovia has embraced Queen Amber.

She deserves her due.

This is private financial information
about the trade agreement.

Is this an assessment
of Aldovia's debt to Penglia,

50:36.616 --> 50:37.826
a billion euros?

50:37.909 --> 50:39.202
That sounds correct.

50:39.536 --> 50:40.912
But a year ago it was five billion,

50:40.996 --> 50:43.123
and with our economy,
it should be gone by spring.

55:51.348 --> 55:52.223
Look at them.

55:52.640 --> 55:54.184
[bells jingle]

56:00.398 --> 56:01.232
[Amber chuckles]

56:03.276 --> 56:04.861
-That was amazing.
-[man yells joyfully]

56:07.614 --> 56:10.116
For a moment,
I almost forgot about everything.

56:11.701 --> 56:13.411
-It's going to be fine.
-[Amber sighs deeply]

56:13.787 --> 56:15.288
With us and the baby.

56:15.622 --> 56:16.623
I hope so.

56:16.873 --> 56:18.875
[emotional instrumentals]

56:20.752 --> 56:21.586
King Tai.

56:21.795 --> 56:22.712
Come on, Ming.

56:22.796 --> 56:24.964
It's been too long not skating.

56:25.423 --> 56:26.508
Anything else?

56:28.426 --> 56:29.969
[gasps] Archery!

56:30.261 --> 56:31.805
That's something I can do.

56:31.971 --> 56:34.974
-I challenge anyone to archery.
-[Queen Helena] You may regret it.

56:35.058 --> 56:37.185
We have a champion archer in the fold.

56:38.061 --> 56:39.938
[cheery instrumentals]

56:40.522 --> 56:42.232
Champion archer? Me?

56:42.816 --> 56:44.317
According to Queen Helena.

56:44.401 --> 56:46.861
I've seen her stop an embezzler
with her bow.

56:46.945 --> 56:48.321
Sounds like a bit of fun.

56:48.988 --> 56:50.615
Visiting kingdom shoots first.

56:50.907 --> 56:51.741
Richard...

56:55.286 --> 56:56.121
[bow string whips]

56:56.204 --> 56:57.038
[thud]

56:57.122 --> 56:58.748
Nicely done, my dear.

56:58.832 --> 57:00.208
Excellent shot, my Queen.

57:03.378 --> 57:06.047
Clear your mind
and focus on what's most important.

57:06.131 --> 57:07.006
You got this.

57:07.090 --> 57:10.218
Excuse me, Your Majesties, a message
from the palace regarding the treaty.

57:10.385 --> 57:12.762
The dog failed, the treaty remains lost.

57:12.846 --> 57:13.805
-[Amber exhales]
-[thud]

57:13.888 --> 57:15.306
-Whoa. Bullseye!
-[Amber sighs]

57:16.141 --> 57:17.058
[Queen Helena] Oh!

57:18.017 --> 57:19.018
She's fainted.

57:19.978 --> 57:22.021
[dramatic instrumentals]

57:24.399 --> 57:25.316
[Amber shakily exhales]

57:26.943 --> 57:28.653
Let's just make it to the chaise.

57:28.736 --> 57:30.822
Really, Richard, [stammers] I'm okay.

57:31.156 --> 57:32.740
-I just want to make sure.
-[Amber sighs]

57:33.241 --> 57:35.577
Doctor Magoro. Sir, it's Dr. Magoro.

57:35.994 --> 57:36.870
Thank you.

57:36.953 --> 57:39.122
-I understand the Queen's fainted?
-Yes.

57:39.247 --> 57:40.832
Yes, she fainted, but she's awake now.

57:40.915 --> 57:43.209
- She has been overdoing it.
-[Richard] I thought so.

57:43.710 --> 57:44.711
You've overdone it.

57:44.836 --> 57:45.670
She needs rest.

57:45.753 --> 57:47.130
[Richard] Rest, yes. I'll tell her.

57:47.213 --> 57:48.590
Why don't I drive to the palace?

57:48.673 --> 57:50.049
We'd be very grateful.   Thank you.

57:50.633 --> 57:51.468
She's on her way.

57:51.843 --> 57:53.303
I told you, I'm fine.

57:53.678 --> 57:55.472
Still, you must rest
until she gets here.

57:55.555 --> 57:57.599
That's doctor's and king's orders.

57:57.974 --> 57:59.350
Princess' orders as well.

57:59.517 --> 58:00.435
Rest.

58:00.518 --> 58:02.645
How can I
when we only have until midnight?

58:04.272 --> 58:05.106
How long?

58:06.649 --> 58:07.692
Great, thank you.

58:10.111 --> 58:11.446
The airport is opening shortly.

58:12.697 --> 58:14.073
Will you please arrange transport?

58:14.157 --> 58:15.658
I will see to it, Miss Lynn.

58:22.999 --> 58:23.833
There you are.

58:25.877 --> 58:27.921
Sorry, I have some news.

58:28.546 --> 58:29.797
The airport is open.

58:30.089 --> 58:31.424
The Penglians are leaving.

58:31.508 --> 58:32.842
[Queen Helena] Oh my goodness.

58:34.427 --> 58:35.512
Shall I speak to them?

58:35.595 --> 58:37.514
-Please, Mother.
-Mr. Zabala

58:37.597 --> 58:39.724
Yes, of course, Your Majesty.
Excuse me.

58:43.728 --> 58:44.854
What do we do now?

58:45.188 --> 58:46.773
We have to expose Simon and Lynn.

58:46.898 --> 58:48.566
It's our last hope to find the treaty.

58:48.650 --> 58:49.817
Absolutely.

58:49.901 --> 58:50.818
Simon?

58:51.361 --> 58:53.821
He and Lynn have been conspiring
since she arrived.

58:54.030 --> 58:56.491
-That's disgraceful.
-But not unexpected.

58:56.658 --> 58:58.785
Listen, something is nagging at me.

58:59.452 --> 59:00.578
Call it instinct.

59:01.246 --> 59:04.749
If we are correct, and Simon and Lynn
took the treaty and hid it,

59:05.375 --> 59:07.085
why didn't the police dog find it?

59:07.168 --> 59:09.170
-We'll have to ask Simon.
-But there's more.

59:09.504 --> 59:12.257
The old scandal
between Prince Claude and Prince Jun.

59:12.799 --> 59:14.926
The family swore they would get revenge.

59:15.301 --> 59:18.346
Maybe that's why the treaty
was nearly stolen 200 years ago.

59:18.721 --> 59:20.431
The treaty was stolen before?

59:21.224 --> 59:22.058
[Amber cries out]

59:22.141 --> 59:23.351
What, what's wrong?

59:23.518 --> 59:26.771
I don't know, cramping. [pants]
Cramping bad.

59:27.146 --> 59:27.981
Oh my gosh.

59:28.064 --> 59:28.940
Does that mean...

59:29.607 --> 59:30.984
-I think so.
-What is it?

59:31.693 --> 59:33.111
I'm going into labor.

59:34.195 --> 59:35.154
[shaky exhale]

59:35.280 --> 59:36.698
[suspenseful instrumentals]

59:36.781 --> 59:38.032
[car rushing]

59:43.121 --> 59:45.373
-[phone ringing]
-Oh.

59:45.832 --> 59:47.125
Hello? King Richard?

59:47.625 --> 59:49.794
Doctor, Amber's gone into labor.

59:50.044 --> 59:50.962
Labor? Now?

59:51.671 --> 59:54.507
No, no, no, she's not due
until January, Your Majesty.

59:54.591 --> 59:56.551
Her back hurts and she has cramping.

59:57.260 --> 59:59.512
Could be forced labor
due to over activity.

59:59.637 --> 01:00:00.680
She has been very active.

01:00:01.014 --> 01:00:04.726
Tell the Queen,
deep breaths and remain calm.

01:00:04.809 --> 01:00:06.227
All right. Thank you, Doctor.

01:00:06.311 --> 01:00:07.645
See you very soon. Bye.

01:00:13.276 --> 01:00:14.402
-[owl screeches]
-Ooh!

01:00:14.485 --> 01:00:15.695
[tires squealing]

01:00:16.821 --> 01:00:17.989
-[brakes screeching]
-[gasps]

01:00:19.198 --> 01:00:21.034
[gasps, pants]

01:00:21.159 --> 01:00:22.785
[engine hissing]

01:00:23.661 --> 01:00:24.621
[Amber exhales deeply]

01:00:25.955 --> 01:00:28.708
-Is it true? Have you gone into labor?
-It appears so.

01:00:29.083 --> 01:00:32.378
-How far apart are the contractions?
-Close. Getting stronger.

01:00:32.462 --> 01:00:34.464
We call them surges as per the doctor

01:00:34.547 --> 01:00:36.424
-who's on her way.
-[phone ringing]

01:00:38.176 --> 01:00:39.010
This is her.

01:00:41.220 --> 01:00:42.305
[Dr. Magoro] King Richard...

01:00:42.597 --> 01:00:45.391
I found myself in a bit of a situation.

01:00:45.850 --> 01:00:47.518
[exhales] Where are you?

01:00:48.102 --> 01:00:49.562
North road. Stay in your car.

01:00:49.854 --> 01:00:50.688
What is it?

01:00:50.772 --> 01:00:52.023
She's stuck in a snow bank.

01:00:52.106 --> 01:00:53.191
But the baby's coming.

01:00:53.608 --> 01:00:56.527
I used to volunteer at a maternity ward.
I will help you through this.

01:00:57.028 --> 01:00:57.862
[Amber sighs]

01:00:57.945 --> 01:01:00.114
Tai, cancel our flight.

01:01:00.239 --> 01:01:02.033
Of course. Lynn!

01:01:02.283 --> 01:01:03.409
Thank you, Queen Ming.

01:01:03.618 --> 01:01:05.161
-I'll get Dr. Magoro.
-[exhales] Richard!

01:01:05.244 --> 01:01:06.996
I'll be back with her as soon as I can.

01:01:07.497 --> 01:01:09.082
You can do this, birth plan or not.

01:01:09.165 --> 01:01:09.999
I love you.

01:01:10.416 --> 01:01:12.210
-I love you.
-[kissing sound]

01:01:12.293 --> 01:01:14.379
-[Amber inhales]
-Take care of her, please.

01:01:14.504 --> 01:01:15.546
[Amber exhales in pain]

01:01:16.089 --> 01:01:16.923
[Amber gasps]

01:01:17.048 --> 01:01:18.800
Richard, we heard about Amber.
Is there--

01:01:18.883 --> 01:01:20.718
-[gruff] I'll deal with you later.
-[Simon] Wh--

01:01:23.012 --> 01:01:24.097
[Amber exhales]

01:01:27.684 --> 01:01:29.519
[suspenseful instrumentals continue]

01:01:29.602 --> 01:01:30.978
[snow crunching]

01:01:36.484 --> 01:01:37.735
-Good boy, let's go.
-[thudding]

01:01:38.861 --> 01:01:40.988
I too had the baby come early.

01:01:41.072 --> 01:01:42.615
-You did?
-My son.

01:01:42.699 --> 01:01:43.533
He's okay?

01:01:43.950 --> 01:01:45.910
He's intelligent, capable

01:01:46.285 --> 01:01:49.455
-and has the energy of three boys.
-[Amber sighs]

01:01:49.914 --> 01:01:52.333
Your baby will be perfectly fine.

01:01:52.458 --> 01:01:54.877
Your child is strong, Amber.
Like you and Richard.

01:01:55.253 --> 01:01:57.964
But I can't help but worry
that it's going to be midnight soon.

01:01:58.214 --> 01:02:00.007
If that treaty isn't signed,

01:02:00.341 --> 01:02:01.884
my baby is cursed.

01:02:01.968 --> 01:02:02.885
Emily!

01:02:03.428 --> 01:02:06.180
I told you not to worry Amber
with that nonsense.

01:02:06.848 --> 01:02:07.974
But what if it's true?

01:02:08.516 --> 01:02:11.269
Sorcery was discredited a long time ago,

01:02:11.602 --> 01:02:12.520
for good reason.

01:02:12.937 --> 01:02:15.732
Many old treaties
involved punitive superstitions.

01:02:16.315 --> 01:02:18.192
-It's not unusual.
-[Amber sighs]

01:02:19.610 --> 01:02:20.945
Tell me about this one.

01:02:21.320 --> 01:02:24.407
Well, what I read
was about a sorceress that cast a spell.

01:02:25.199 --> 01:02:26.451
[dramatic instrumentals]

01:02:26.534 --> 01:02:27.785
[hooves knocking]

01:02:32.540 --> 01:02:34.083
-[wolf howls in distance]
-[horse neighs]

01:02:36.085 --> 01:02:37.128
[continued howling]

01:02:38.504 --> 01:02:39.338
Not tonight.

01:02:39.630 --> 01:02:40.590
[horse chuffs]

01:02:41.299 --> 01:02:42.800
-Come on!
-[horse brays]

01:02:43.176 --> 01:02:44.802
The curse affects the firstborn child

01:02:44.886 --> 01:02:46.846
of whichever kingdom
causes the truce to break.

01:02:47.263 --> 01:02:50.433
Typical for its time,
but that time is not our time.

01:02:50.516 --> 01:02:51.476
Still...

01:02:51.726 --> 01:02:53.853
You don't want to risk it, I understand,

01:02:54.395 --> 01:02:56.397
as small a chance as it may be.

01:02:56.981 --> 01:02:59.734
A mother's love for her child
is greater than anything.

01:02:59.817 --> 01:03:03.362
Someone in this palace
sabotaged the signing of the treaty. Why?

01:03:03.780 --> 01:03:05.031
[Amber gasping]

01:03:05.198 --> 01:03:08.409
[exhales] Your Majesty!
I've spoken to the doctor

01:03:08.493 --> 01:03:12.455
and she said it's acceptable
to administer pain medication for your...

01:03:13.790 --> 01:03:14.749
surges.

01:03:14.832 --> 01:03:17.543
Thank you, Mrs. Averill,
but I need to keep my mind sharp.

01:03:17.627 --> 01:03:18.586
Amber...

01:03:19.378 --> 01:03:22.131
We all want what's best for your baby
and for you.

01:03:22.673 --> 01:03:24.967
Please try not to worry needlessly.

01:03:25.218 --> 01:03:26.511
Maybe it isn't needless.

01:03:26.594 --> 01:03:29.430
It could be real.
After all, our dungeon is haunted.

01:03:29.514 --> 01:03:31.307
-Haunted?
-Yes.

01:03:31.390 --> 01:03:33.100
Mr. Little even encountered it,

01:03:33.267 --> 01:03:35.937
the ghost of the thief
who stole the treaty 200 years ago.

01:03:36.145 --> 01:03:38.064
[breathless] Emily, listen to me.

01:03:38.147 --> 01:03:41.234
I need you to do something
for me right now. [sharp exhale]

01:03:41.943 --> 01:03:43.319
[eerie instrumentals]

01:03:48.282 --> 01:03:50.910
Why on earth
did Amber want us to come down here?

01:03:51.327 --> 01:03:53.663
She insists we search the furthest corner.

01:03:56.541 --> 01:03:59.627
[Emily] Pray we avoid the ghost
that haunts this dungeon.

01:04:00.628 --> 01:04:03.005
You're not scared
of the made-up ghost, are you?

01:04:16.435 --> 01:04:17.603
[indistinct rattling]

01:04:18.104 --> 01:04:18.980
What was that?

01:04:19.981 --> 01:04:21.983
Just-- Just our imaginations.

01:04:22.149 --> 01:04:23.526
Working in unison.

01:04:25.194 --> 01:04:26.028
Come along.

01:04:29.615 --> 01:04:31.617
[dubious instrumentals]

01:04:34.453 --> 01:04:35.413
[door creaks open]

01:04:42.753 --> 01:04:43.754
[Emily breathing shakily]

01:04:49.176 --> 01:04:50.344
[Emily] Leopold was here.

01:04:51.470 --> 01:04:52.513
Now we are.

01:04:52.597 --> 01:04:53.681

[yelling] Help!

01:05:00.479 --> 01:05:01.314
Oh, dear.

01:05:01.981 --> 01:05:03.566
[Emily, yelling] Help! Help us!

01:05:04.734 --> 01:05:05.651
Help!

01:05:06.485 --> 01:05:07.653
Please help!

01:05:33.471 --> 01:05:34.472
Dr. Magoro?

01:05:35.056 --> 01:05:37.350
-Are you all right?
-I am now, thank you.

01:05:38.225 --> 01:05:39.727
I trust you know how to ride. [exhales]

01:05:39.810 --> 01:05:41.646
-I do, indeed.
-[door clicks open]

01:05:42.063 --> 01:05:43.105
[horse brays]

01:05:49.904 --> 01:05:52.156
-[Amber exhales heavily]
-[Queen Ming] You're doing good.

01:05:52.281 --> 01:05:53.282
[Amber groans]

01:05:54.450 --> 01:05:55.993
-Poor thing.
-[continued groaning]

01:05:57.954 --> 01:05:58.955
[shaky breathing]

01:05:59.705 --> 01:06:01.040
[heavy sigh]

01:06:01.791 --> 01:06:03.626
This is not the time, Simon.

01:06:06.963 --> 01:06:07.797
Amber.

01:06:08.297 --> 01:06:10.549
You look like you could use these.

01:06:10.925 --> 01:06:13.302
Squeeze these
when you're feeling overwhelmed.

01:06:14.345 --> 01:06:15.221
Works for me.

01:06:16.222 --> 01:06:17.390
Thank you, Simon.

01:06:21.394 --> 01:06:22.269
[labored breathing]

01:06:23.020 --> 01:06:25.314
The hot water you requested, Your Majesty.

01:06:25.523 --> 01:06:27.316
[Amber moans]

01:06:28.067 --> 01:06:31.445
I need a heating pad
and a paint roller with a good handle.

01:06:31.988 --> 01:06:33.572
Of course, straight away.

01:06:34.949 --> 01:06:37.702
I have a heating pad
and good luck with the roller.

01:06:39.120 --> 01:06:40.705
Is there anything we can do to help?

01:06:40.997 --> 01:06:44.417
I am charged
with finding a paint roller in a palace.

01:06:45.292 --> 01:06:47.378
-I possess such an item.
-[playful instrumentals]

01:06:47.503 --> 01:06:48.546
-Really?
-You do?

01:06:48.921 --> 01:06:50.214
With a good handle?

01:06:50.756 --> 01:06:53.092
A very excellent handle, yes.

01:06:53.175 --> 01:06:55.052
And may I ask why?

01:06:55.136 --> 01:06:57.471
No, you may not, Andrew.

01:06:58.764 --> 01:07:00.224
Come, Mr. Z.

01:07:00.558 --> 01:07:02.810
-We will get it.
-Thank you.

01:07:06.063 --> 01:07:07.273
[gulps, sighs]

01:07:07.565 --> 01:07:09.942
[Emily, yelling] Help! Please help us!

01:07:10.234 --> 01:07:11.360
Help!

01:07:11.861 --> 01:07:13.946
It's no use, darling, no one can hear us.

01:07:14.321 --> 01:07:15.906
-[dramatic instrumentals]
-[Emily sighs]

01:07:16.991 --> 01:07:18.534
Look, a key!

01:07:22.788 --> 01:07:24.665
-[sighs] It's too far.
-[strained exhale]

01:07:26.125 --> 01:07:27.501
[breathless] That's really helping.

01:07:27.710 --> 01:07:29.503
How long did you volunteer
at the hospital?

01:07:29.587 --> 01:07:31.672
-Many years.
-You certainly learned a lot.

01:07:31.922 --> 01:07:35.259
I learned no job is more demanding
or rewarding than motherhood.

01:07:35.468 --> 01:07:37.428
Penglia now has services in place

01:07:37.511 --> 01:07:41.098
to assist and support all of our mothers
in any way they might need.

01:07:41.182 --> 01:07:43.184
[exhales] I heard about that program,
it's fantastic.

01:07:43.267 --> 01:07:45.269
I'm trying to implement
something similar here,

01:07:45.519 --> 01:07:46.729
with a few updates.

01:07:47.354 --> 01:07:49.231
-[dramatic instrumentals]
-[strained sighs]

01:07:51.567 --> 01:07:53.694
-You're so close.
-[grunts]

01:07:54.904 --> 01:07:56.322
That's it, almost.

01:07:56.405 --> 01:07:58.115
You have it, you've got it.

01:07:58.991 --> 01:08:00.159
-You got it!
-[strains]

01:08:00.659 --> 01:08:02.787
There you are. Good girl.

01:08:03.662 --> 01:08:04.830
Almost there.

01:08:05.581 --> 01:08:06.624
Lift it up.

01:08:08.292 --> 01:08:09.627
-[Queen Helena] Oh!
-[Emily yells]

01:08:09.710 --> 01:08:10.669
-Emily!
-[thud]

01:08:10.836 --> 01:08:13.130
Emily, are you all right?

01:08:13.255 --> 01:08:15.633
-Yes, I'm fine.
-The stone didn't hurt you?

01:08:16.383 --> 01:08:17.968
Look, in there.

01:08:18.176 --> 01:08:20.304
-I can't believe it.
-The missing treaty.

01:08:21.263 --> 01:08:22.640
[hissing breath]

01:08:23.349 --> 01:08:24.350
What was that?

01:08:24.433 --> 01:08:26.685
-[wind whirring]
-[Emily gasps]

01:08:27.185 --> 01:08:28.938
The ghost, coming to get the treaty.

01:08:29.020 --> 01:08:30.689
-[pants]
-No, listen.

01:08:30.898 --> 01:08:31.941
[wind whistling]

01:08:32.149 --> 01:08:34.234
It's the wind blowing through the stones.

01:08:34.819 --> 01:08:37.071
-[stammers] So, no ghost?
-[exhales]

01:08:37.947 --> 01:08:38.781
No.

01:08:40.658 --> 01:08:42.033
But we have the treaty.

01:08:43.160 --> 01:08:44.578
But we're still locked in.

01:08:47.706 --> 01:08:48.999
[wind rushing]

01:08:49.291 --> 01:08:50.709
[horse neighs]

01:08:52.252 --> 01:08:54.087
-[Richard] Amber.
-[Amber] Richard.

01:08:54.212 --> 01:08:56.881
-[Richard pants] How are you?
-No baby yet.

01:08:57.341 --> 01:08:59.301
Everything's going to be fine,
Your Majesty.

01:08:59.760 --> 01:09:01.261
How far apart are the surges?

01:09:01.345 --> 01:09:02.930
Five minutes, progressing steadily.

01:09:03.013 --> 01:09:05.390
Ah. Thank you for being so attentive.

01:09:07.143 --> 01:09:07.977
[Amber sighs]

01:09:09.145 --> 01:09:10.187
[wind whirring]

01:09:10.437 --> 01:09:11.438
It's useless.

01:09:11.729 --> 01:09:13.064
It's nearly midnight.

01:09:13.941 --> 01:09:14.774
It's over.

01:09:16.109 --> 01:09:17.194
We mustn't give up.

01:09:17.653 --> 01:09:18.821
But what can we do?

01:09:24.493 --> 01:09:25.327
This.

01:09:28.080 --> 01:09:29.790
[chuckles] Brilliant, Mother.

01:09:29.874 --> 01:09:31.250
[plucky instrumentals]

01:09:35.045 --> 01:09:37.798
[rattling]

01:09:38.716 --> 01:09:39.550
[click]

01:09:39.884 --> 01:09:41.010
The linens, doctor.

01:09:42.344 --> 01:09:43.345
[Amber] What time is it?

01:09:44.305 --> 01:09:45.639
Ten minutes to midnight.

01:09:46.307 --> 01:09:47.433
[breathless] Where are they?

01:09:48.392 --> 01:09:49.852
The treaty, we found the treaty.

01:09:50.102 --> 01:09:50.935
What? Where?

01:09:51.520 --> 01:09:52.479
In the dungeon.

01:09:54.481 --> 01:09:55.691
How did you know?

01:09:56.066 --> 01:09:57.276
Amber solved the mystery.

01:09:58.235 --> 01:09:59.069
I did.

01:10:00.112 --> 01:10:02.531
Come in, everyone.
You all need to hear this.

01:10:02.907 --> 01:10:06.452
Someone right here,
in this very room, stole the treaty.

01:10:08.370 --> 01:10:09.872
[Richard] Tell us everything you know.

01:10:10.748 --> 01:10:12.917
The scandal that followed the signing
of the treaty

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:15.502
resulted in the alleged poisoning
of Prince Claude.

01:10:16.003 --> 01:10:17.671
His family swore vengeance

01:10:17.880 --> 01:10:20.216
and a member of that family
is in this room.

01:10:21.425 --> 01:10:22.259
[Richard] Go on.

01:10:23.052 --> 01:10:26.096
Prince Claude's family name,
Devon, was familiar to me

01:10:26.388 --> 01:10:28.098
and tonight I remembered why.

01:10:28.474 --> 01:10:29.934
I read it in this book.

01:10:31.310 --> 01:10:33.103
Your mother's maiden name was Devin.

01:10:33.771 --> 01:10:35.606
Wasn't it, Mr. Little?

01:10:35.689 --> 01:10:36.732
[gasping]

01:10:40.819 --> 01:10:43.405
I know it was you, Mr. Little.

01:10:45.950 --> 01:10:47.993
You were the last one
to lock up the treaty,

01:10:48.160 --> 01:10:50.037
you kept the dog out of the dungeon

01:10:50.120 --> 01:10:52.456
and you tried to keep Emily
out of the dungeon

01:10:52.539 --> 01:10:54.416
with some made-up ghost story.

01:10:54.583 --> 01:10:55.501
[Amber sighs]

01:10:56.252 --> 01:10:58.796
-[continued sighing]
-If you're guilty, Mr. Little,

01:10:59.463 --> 01:11:00.839
confess here and now.

01:11:01.340 --> 01:11:02.216
I did do it.

01:11:03.092 --> 01:11:04.260
To break the truce

01:11:04.635 --> 01:11:06.553
and sever our ties with Penglia.

01:11:07.554 --> 01:11:08.389
But why?

01:11:09.056 --> 01:11:10.808
I was bound by a solemn blood oath,

01:11:10.891 --> 01:11:14.353
a sworn duty
to avenge the crime against my family

01:11:14.728 --> 01:11:16.355
by the Penglian Prince Jun.

01:11:16.438 --> 01:11:20.109
Mr. Little,
Prince Jun's guilt was never proven.

01:11:20.693 --> 01:11:23.279
Our historians believe
that the real culprit

01:11:23.654 --> 01:11:25.572
was a covetous feudal lord.

01:11:25.864 --> 01:11:28.117
I had a duty. I fulfilled it.

01:11:29.201 --> 01:11:30.744
You nearly started a war.

01:11:31.161 --> 01:11:33.497
And could have cursed an innocent baby.

01:11:34.206 --> 01:11:36.542
I didn't know about the curse
until tonight.

01:11:37.751 --> 01:11:40.629
And I would never bring harm
to your baby.

01:11:41.630 --> 01:11:43.549
-[Queen Helena] Mr. Zabala.
-Ma'am?

01:11:44.967 --> 01:11:47.219
Take Mr. Little to the Leopold Suite.

01:11:47.303 --> 01:11:48.512
-[dark instrumentals]
-At once.

01:11:52.308 --> 01:11:53.142
Simon,

01:11:53.934 --> 01:11:55.644
I apologize for my behavior earlier.

01:11:56.937 --> 01:11:57.855
Did you think...

01:11:58.897 --> 01:12:00.482
We had our suspicions.

01:12:02.818 --> 01:12:03.986
Not you, too!

01:12:05.446 --> 01:12:07.156
Lynn and I have been working diligently

01:12:07.239 --> 01:12:10.743
on economic amendments to the treaty
which should benefit both kingdoms.

01:12:11.243 --> 01:12:13.203
And we've found a very promising solution.

01:12:14.830 --> 01:12:15.956
That's all it was, I promise.

01:12:18.334 --> 01:12:19.168
What is it?

01:12:19.793 --> 01:12:23.464
When I came to your room last night
after Lynn left, you hid something.

01:12:23.630 --> 01:12:25.466
[stammers] How can that relate
to the treaty?

01:12:26.884 --> 01:12:27.718
It didn't.

01:12:29.428 --> 01:12:32.097
Lynn was helping to make sure
I chose well

01:12:32.556 --> 01:12:34.683
when picking out the most important gift
I'll offer you.

01:12:34.767 --> 01:12:36.101
[emotional instrumentals]

01:12:36.477 --> 01:12:38.187
I wanted to wait until tomorrow, but...

01:12:40.064 --> 01:12:41.231
Melissa, my love...

01:12:42.483 --> 01:12:44.318
Although I'm undeserving of such an honor,

01:12:46.111 --> 01:12:46.987
will you marry me?

01:12:48.655 --> 01:12:50.741
-[whimsical instrumentals]
-Yes! Yes.

01:12:50.824 --> 01:12:52.159
-Yes!
-[laughter]

01:12:52.368 --> 01:12:53.327

[continued laughter]

01:12:59.291 --> 01:13:00.542
[Richard] Congratulations.

01:13:01.251 --> 01:13:03.087
Congratulations, Simon.

01:13:03.670 --> 01:13:04.588
[Simon laughs]

01:13:05.422 --> 01:13:06.965
[Emily] Congratulations, Melissa.

01:13:07.257 --> 01:13:08.509
You could have done worse.

01:13:08.592 --> 01:13:10.928
Oh, that's a ringing endorsement.
[chuckles]

01:13:11.261 --> 01:13:12.554
Don't let it get to your head.

01:13:12.638 --> 01:13:14.056
[playful instrumentals]

01:13:14.139 --> 01:13:16.183
I see a royal title in your future, Simon.

01:13:17.017 --> 01:13:18.018
Perhaps Duke?

01:13:19.144 --> 01:13:20.354
I accept.

01:13:20.521 --> 01:13:23.148
This is such wonderful news.
I'm so happy for you.

01:13:23.649 --> 01:13:26.193
But we're running out of time.
It's nearly midnight

01:13:26.527 --> 01:13:27.903
and there's a treaty to sign.

01:13:28.445 --> 01:13:30.280
-Quickly.
-[Queen Ming] Yes.

01:13:30.364 --> 01:13:33.909
We must allow the time
for the Queens to sign as well.

01:13:34.451 --> 01:13:36.328
There's always time to make history.

01:13:36.453 --> 01:13:38.831
[sharp exhale] But not too much time.

01:13:38.914 --> 01:13:39.748
[Amber gasps]

01:13:44.711 --> 01:13:46.213
Your Majesty, King Tai.

01:13:46.839 --> 01:13:49.007
The visiting monarch signs first.

01:13:51.051 --> 01:13:52.553
After you, my Queen.

01:13:53.095 --> 01:13:55.722
You have made me
and all of Penglia very proud.

01:13:55.931 --> 01:13:57.015
[Amber sighs]

01:14:01.895 --> 01:14:03.814

-[Amber moans]

01:14:17.828 --> 01:14:23.876
At the hour of 11:59,
on December the 24th in the year 2019,

01:14:24.126 --> 01:14:26.128
I declare the truce and treaty

01:14:26.253 --> 01:14:28.964
between the kingdoms
of Aldovia and Penglia

01:14:29.381 --> 01:14:30.299
executed,

01:14:30.632 --> 01:14:34.595
ratified and renewed
for the next 100 years.

[sighs of relief]

01:14:38.891 --> 01:14:39.725
We made it.

01:14:41.643 --> 01:14:43.103
-[exhales]
-Merry Christmas.

01:14:43.187 --> 01:14:44.021
