WEBVTT

00:00.751 --> 00:02.885
<i>Previously on x company.</i>

00:05.523 --> 00:07.857
Argh!

00:07.892 --> 00:10.559
I would like you to meet dagna.

00:10.595 --> 00:13.829
I think she will be
very happy here.

00:13.865 --> 00:15.564
Operation marigold
isn't about a refinery.

00:15.600 --> 00:17.733
<i>It's about him. He's going to.</i>

00:17.768 --> 00:20.214
Flood germany with synthetic oil
and win the war by springtime.

00:20.238 --> 00:23.038
<i>So if something happened to voigt...
I have arranged.</i>

00:23.074 --> 00:24.874
For you to
accompany me to berlin.

00:24.909 --> 00:27.877
<i>Herr professor voigt will be
presented with an award.</i>

00:27.912 --> 00:31.280
At the gala for his
contributions to the reich.

00:31.315 --> 00:33.249
You're going to be
helene bauer full time,

00:33.284 --> 00:35.017
And it is not going to be easy.

00:35.052 --> 00:37.686
<i>You will do things and say
things that you don't want to,</i>

00:37.722 --> 00:40.882
<i>But you've got to keep your eye on the
bigger picture. What are you waiting for?</i>

00:45.129 --> 00:48.063
How do you live with yourself?
Your hands aren't clean either.

00:55.940 --> 00:58.107
<i>Did I tell my father
about the spies.</i>

00:58.142 --> 01:01.243
<i>Who pretend to be my friends?
You will help us in poland.</i>

01:05.583 --> 01:07.550
I want you to know.

01:07.585 --> 01:10.119
That you were killed by a jew.

01:10.154 --> 01:13.455
A double agent. The allies
only think I'm a double agent.

01:13.491 --> 01:15.324
The only way to pay off
the long-term game.

01:15.359 --> 01:18.060
Is to secure the man
who's sending those spies.

01:18.095 --> 01:20.262
<i>Colonel duncan sinclair.</i>

01:20.298 --> 01:22.331
<i>How do you plan to do that?
I have.</i>

01:22.366 --> 01:25.067
His son.

01:27.000 --> 01:33.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:49.860 --> 01:52.828
Ahem!

01:52.863 --> 01:55.864
You missed the good bits.

01:55.900 --> 01:58.267
Ten glorious years.

01:58.302 --> 01:59.868
You'd think
the war was already won.

01:59.904 --> 02:02.338
Tell that to our army
in stalingrad,

02:02.373 --> 02:04.607
Which we've officially
been forbidden to mention.

02:04.642 --> 02:07.476
Yeah. Truth is not
as entertaining.

02:11.682 --> 02:14.483
Schmidt's picking me up
from the hotel at 7:00.

02:14.518 --> 02:16.485
Where will professor voigt be?

02:16.520 --> 02:18.487
He'll be brought to victory hall.

02:18.522 --> 02:21.090
Separately. The main event
is in the ballroom,

02:21.125 --> 02:23.192
But his award will be
in a secure side ceremony.

02:23.227 --> 02:25.394
Beginning at 7:30. Good.

02:25.429 --> 02:27.663
I must warn you.

02:27.698 --> 02:29.665
With himmler's guards,

02:29.700 --> 02:31.667
Access will be
nearly impossible.

02:31.702 --> 02:33.669
What would happen.

02:33.704 --> 02:35.904
If there were an attack
on the building?

02:35.940 --> 02:38.307
It would be locked down.
Priority would be.

02:38.342 --> 02:40.676
To protect himmler and to
get him to a secure location.

02:40.711 --> 02:43.045
As quickly as possible.
And voigt?

02:43.080 --> 02:45.114
Would be in my care.

02:46.851 --> 02:49.151
We could take him
somewhere quiet, out of the way.

02:49.186 --> 02:52.821
I can't be implicated.
And you won't.

02:52.857 --> 02:55.102
He'll have a "heart attack,"
triggered with a security threat.

02:55.126 --> 02:57.159
You're protecting him from.

02:57.194 --> 02:59.428
We'll keep you clean.

02:59.463 --> 03:02.064
I just need an opportunity.

03:02.099 --> 03:04.366
There's a library.

03:04.402 --> 03:06.368
At the far end
of the south hall.

03:08.406 --> 03:11.106
Good.

03:11.142 --> 03:13.609
I'll be waiting. Mhm.

03:18.149 --> 03:20.215
The other night...
It never happened.

03:24.288 --> 03:27.056
Heidi saw us.

03:27.091 --> 03:30.759
What does she know?
Her body won't be found.

03:30.795 --> 03:33.062
I told you. We keep you clean.

03:36.467 --> 03:39.034
I have your word
that you'll deliver voigt?

03:39.070 --> 03:41.036
As long as sinclair.

03:41.072 --> 03:43.839
Holds up his end
of our agreement.

03:43.874 --> 03:45.974
What agreement?

03:53.317 --> 03:55.784
It's a stunning example.

03:55.820 --> 03:58.487
Of late traditional
baroque styling. You'll notice.

03:58.522 --> 04:01.290
In this art that the artist
has placed the two subjects.

04:01.325 --> 04:03.292
Close...

04:03.327 --> 04:05.961
But the lack
of eye contact suggests.

04:05.996 --> 04:07.963
A great emotional distance,

04:07.998 --> 04:09.965
A strained confrontation.

04:10.000 --> 04:12.000
Some even think
it's actually the same man.

04:12.036 --> 04:14.002
The younger self.

04:14.038 --> 04:16.605
Is in dark contemplation
about his future,

04:16.640 --> 04:18.507
About who he'll become.

04:18.541 --> 04:21.610
If you're interested,

04:21.644 --> 04:23.812
There are further examples
of the same period.

04:23.848 --> 04:25.981
In the next room.

04:27.818 --> 04:29.785
Excuse me.

04:29.820 --> 04:33.388
Where can I find the
abyssinian-ceramics collection?

04:36.494 --> 04:38.594
"I'm afraid it's out on loan."

04:38.629 --> 04:40.929
it's good to finally meet you.

04:40.965 --> 04:43.098
In person, manfred. I'm sorry,

04:43.134 --> 04:45.112
I-I-i didn't realize I'd been
corresponding with a woman.

04:45.136 --> 04:47.269
Turns out we're
everywhere these days.

04:47.304 --> 04:48.737
<i>Ja.</i>

04:48.773 --> 04:50.773
Is there somewhere we can talk?

04:55.546 --> 04:57.513
<i>Franz.</i>

04:57.548 --> 05:00.015
I just learned
of your latest coup.

05:00.050 --> 05:02.885
<i>Oberst-gruppenfuhrer kohler
had a few questions.</i>

05:02.920 --> 05:05.788
The news that you have been
operating as a triple agent...

05:05.823 --> 05:08.657
Well, it was a bit of a shock
to our higher-ups.

05:08.692 --> 05:10.926
I see.

05:10.961 --> 05:12.928
They'd like to have
a moment of your time.

05:12.963 --> 05:14.930
So you can fill in
a few details.

05:14.965 --> 05:17.399
Surely, this can wait
until after the gala tonight.

05:17.434 --> 05:19.334
This won't take long.

05:19.370 --> 05:21.336
I'm sure it's just a formality.

05:27.278 --> 05:30.579
So it comes down to faber keeping his word?
Delivering voigt?

05:30.614 --> 05:33.916
Yeah. He says he will.
As long as we keep him clean.

05:33.951 --> 05:38.053
As long as you keep
your side of the bargain.

05:38.088 --> 05:40.155
What bargain? Faber's not going.

05:40.191 --> 05:42.057
To help us,

05:42.092 --> 05:44.059
Unless I hand over
the recording of sabine first.

05:45.930 --> 05:48.564
That's our leverage. Why would
we give up our only leverage?

05:50.701 --> 05:52.901
He has my son, william.

05:52.937 --> 05:54.903
Here, in berlin.

05:56.640 --> 05:59.608
Your boy's alive? He found him.

05:59.643 --> 06:01.488
In a pow camp in the pacific.
It was a counter-move.

06:01.512 --> 06:03.946
To protect himself.
He's good at what he does.

06:03.981 --> 06:06.715
He's holding him hostage?
He's trying to keep him.

06:06.750 --> 06:08.684
Off the books,
but it's only a matter of time

06:08.719 --> 06:11.587
'til they connect him to me.
The exchange has to happen fast.

06:11.622 --> 06:15.090
You've agreed to it already?
I meet him at 3 o'clock.

06:18.929 --> 06:22.464
When did you first become
aware of these allied agents?

06:22.499 --> 06:24.967
After the sabotage
of the bridge at villemarie.

06:25.002 --> 06:26.969
<i>And the murder
of sturmbannfuhrer richter.</i>

06:27.004 --> 06:29.872
You captured one of them soon after.
Yes, renÃƒÂ©.

06:29.907 --> 06:32.207
Vallieres. His intelligence.

06:32.243 --> 06:34.543
Made us aware of a secret
allied training facility.

06:34.578 --> 06:36.545
In canada known as camp x.

06:36.580 --> 06:39.114
Why didn't you approach anyone.

06:39.149 --> 06:42.284
With your plan to act
as a triple agent?

06:42.319 --> 06:45.754
As a precaution against potentially
disloyal elements within our own ranks.

06:45.789 --> 06:47.623
The safest action was to secure.

06:47.658 --> 06:49.558
As much intelligence
as I could first,

06:49.593 --> 06:51.927
Then to bring it
straight to berlin.

06:51.962 --> 06:55.330
Tell us how exactly
you convinced.

06:55.366 --> 06:57.332
The camp x spies to trust you.

06:57.368 --> 07:00.302
Why did you need to
communicate with him in secret?

07:00.337 --> 07:02.938
To establish a personal level
of trust between us.

07:02.973 --> 07:05.407
So, making secret plans
with the enemy is more important.

07:05.442 --> 07:07.910
Than your own people knowing
what's going on?

07:07.945 --> 07:12.614
I suppose so when you're sending agents
to their death. It had to be done, neil,

07:12.650 --> 07:14.583
And I know that is hard
for you to understand.

07:14.618 --> 07:17.019
They didn't have a chance.
No, they didn't.

07:17.054 --> 07:19.187
They gave their lives for you
and for this mission.

07:19.223 --> 07:22.791
<i>That's what soldiers do.
Alfred graves.</i>

07:22.826 --> 07:25.193
You interrogated
this man personally,

07:25.229 --> 07:27.195
But where are the results?

07:27.231 --> 07:29.765
Were you unable to break him.

07:29.800 --> 07:32.034
Or were you already
in collusion?

07:32.069 --> 07:35.137
I needed more time; His transfer to
berlin interfered. The same transfer.

07:35.172 --> 07:38.206
That resulted in his escape
and that of renÃƒÂ© vallieres?

07:38.242 --> 07:40.375
<i>Unterfuhrer forst
was the officer in charge.</i>

07:40.411 --> 07:42.377
Of that convoy.
I've read the report.

07:42.413 --> 07:44.546
Then you know that the convoy
was attacked.

07:44.581 --> 07:47.716
And your valuable prisoners
were "lost."

07:50.921 --> 07:53.488
According to your report,
you arrived.

07:53.524 --> 07:56.058
And discovered forst dead.

07:56.093 --> 07:57.826
He had been shot in the attack.

07:57.861 --> 08:00.228
As were the other soldiers
on the convoy.

08:00.264 --> 08:02.130
Forst was the only one.

08:02.166 --> 08:05.734
Bludgeoned, severely beaten,
and then shot.

08:05.769 --> 08:07.903
He was a senior officer.

08:07.938 --> 08:10.973
It's likely that the attackers
tortured and questioned him.

08:11.008 --> 08:13.542
Or perhaps he discovered
you had facilitated.

08:13.577 --> 08:17.980
The escape of the spies.
And it was you who killed him?

08:18.015 --> 08:20.849
He didn't.

08:20.884 --> 08:22.851
And I didn't.

08:22.886 --> 08:24.820
So this was.

08:24.855 --> 08:28.824
Before you formed
a triple-agent alliance?

08:28.859 --> 08:30.292
Yes.

08:38.268 --> 08:41.269
I'd like to talk about
your defective son ulli.

08:41.304 --> 08:43.572
<i>If you hand.</i>

08:43.607 --> 08:45.852
Over the recording now, what
guarantee do we have that faber.

08:45.876 --> 08:47.609
Won't sell us out tonight?
Faber wants.

08:47.644 --> 08:50.056
The same things we do. He came to us.
Are you forgetting the bit.

08:50.080 --> 08:52.192
Where we threatened his wife
when he tried to cut and run?

08:52.216 --> 08:53.782
The exchange levels
the playing field.

08:53.817 --> 08:56.051
No more blackmail.
We're bonded on principle.

08:56.086 --> 08:58.754
Lovely. Why don't we bond
after we kill voigt?

08:58.789 --> 09:01.323
Neil, the deal is done.
Don't blame sinclair.

09:03.994 --> 09:06.895
Faber never would have known about
william if it hadn't been for me.

09:06.930 --> 09:09.231
At the safe house in paris,

09:09.266 --> 09:11.433
I was the one who told him
sinclair had a son.

09:11.468 --> 09:13.802
If I'd just kept my mouth shut...
The deal.

09:13.837 --> 09:15.915
Was falling apart, alfred.
You did what you had to do.

09:15.939 --> 09:19.074
To bring him back on board.

09:19.109 --> 09:20.842
It's done.

09:22.179 --> 09:25.447
How did it go? We have a way
to get a weapon inside.

09:25.482 --> 09:27.983
You know that your son's
condition is incurable.

09:28.018 --> 09:30.085
He's mongoloid.
And it was your duty.

09:30.120 --> 09:33.388
To place him
in the aktion t4 program.

09:33.424 --> 09:35.390
Unterfuhrer forst had even
arranged for transport.

09:35.426 --> 09:37.993
But the boy never got
on the bus to the institution.

09:38.028 --> 09:41.430
<i>I understand the brigadefuhrer
dealt with the matter himself.</i>

09:41.465 --> 09:43.932
I didn't want to burden the
reich with my personal problems.

09:43.967 --> 09:46.001
Where is your son?

09:46.036 --> 09:49.571
I killed him.

09:49.606 --> 09:51.907
You didn't entrust him
to a relative?

09:51.942 --> 09:54.643
Get a shovel, I'll show you
where he's buried.

09:56.547 --> 09:58.513
Why would you take that.

09:58.549 --> 10:01.016
Upon yourself, franz?
Because as a genetically.

10:01.051 --> 10:04.119
Defective child, he was a waste
of the nation's resources.

10:04.154 --> 10:06.154
Because it was the will
of the reich.

10:06.190 --> 10:08.023
Be that as it may,

10:08.058 --> 10:10.092
Your file is peppered.

10:10.127 --> 10:11.927
With inconsistent
and insubordinate.

10:11.962 --> 10:15.363
Behaviour. Not to mention
the loss of jacques rigaud.

10:15.399 --> 10:18.300
Judging by facts, not words,

10:18.335 --> 10:20.302
It's frankly hard to tell
which side you are on.

10:20.337 --> 10:23.772
What are your specific plans
as a triple agent?

10:23.807 --> 10:25.941
I will continue
to cultivate my relationship.

10:25.976 --> 10:27.976
With that cell of agents...
Words!

10:28.011 --> 10:30.645
Specifically, I will target
their leader, colonel sinclair.

10:30.681 --> 10:32.781
Words again! Gentlemen,

10:32.816 --> 10:35.350
I suggest we discuss
our next step privately.

10:35.385 --> 10:38.320
Sinclair is fighting this war
because of his son.

10:39.723 --> 10:41.656
He would do
anything to protect him,

10:41.692 --> 10:43.658
Which is why he is in berlin.

10:43.694 --> 10:45.694
And, as it happens,

10:45.729 --> 10:48.096
I have his son in my custody.

10:50.067 --> 10:52.033
I will use his son against him,

10:52.069 --> 10:55.637
And duncan sinclair
will do anything we ask.

10:58.283 --> 11:01.050
The gala tonight is here
at an estate on the edge.

11:01.086 --> 11:03.052
Of this park.

11:03.088 --> 11:05.128
Himmler's presence means
the place will be airtight.

11:05.157 --> 11:08.825
I made contact with manfred franke
at the reichsmuseum. He helped us.

11:08.860 --> 11:11.761
Build helene bauer's cover.
I've convinced him.

11:11.797 --> 11:14.097
To offer a few.

11:14.132 --> 11:17.567
Of the museum's best pieces to
be displayed in the hall tonight.

11:17.602 --> 11:20.570
In honour
of the historic occasion.

11:20.605 --> 11:22.439
He'll give us access.

11:22.474 --> 11:24.441
To the art
before it's delivered.

11:24.476 --> 11:28.711
And we'll use that
to smuggle in a bit.

11:28.747 --> 11:30.947
Of explosive, about this much.

11:30.982 --> 11:33.716
As well as pencil fuse.
When the time is right,

11:33.752 --> 11:37.454
Insert the fuse, crack it, the chemicals
react, you have about 40 seconds to get away.

11:37.489 --> 11:40.423
That's not a lot of c-1.
How do you make sure.

11:40.459 --> 11:42.459
Voigt's close enough?
We don't have to.

11:42.494 --> 11:45.195
The explosion
is just a distraction.

11:45.230 --> 11:47.430
Once aurora detonates it...
They go into lockdown.

11:47.466 --> 11:49.365
Security focuses
on getting himmler.

11:49.401 --> 11:51.034
Out of the building,
while faber secures.

11:51.069 --> 11:52.735
Voigt in a library
down the hall,

11:52.771 --> 11:56.539
Where I'll be waiting for him.
What about the weapon?

11:56.575 --> 11:58.374
Manfred will show us.

11:58.410 --> 12:00.710
Which painting will hang
in the library. We use that.

12:00.745 --> 12:02.879
To smuggle in
the potassium chloride.

12:02.914 --> 12:05.014
A heart attack.

12:05.050 --> 12:07.383
And operation marigold
dies with him.

12:07.419 --> 12:09.152
And nothing traces back
to us or faber.

12:09.187 --> 12:11.421
And we walk off into the sunset.

12:11.456 --> 12:13.523
With our former enemy
who keeps his word.

12:13.558 --> 12:16.392
Because he's a man of principle.

12:16.428 --> 12:18.495
He'll come through.

12:20.298 --> 12:23.066
What time's the exchange? Soon.

12:23.101 --> 12:26.169
I'm coming with you.

12:28.306 --> 12:31.107
You have given them
the honest facts.

12:31.142 --> 12:33.376
Try not to worry.

12:40.352 --> 12:43.987
I feel it's premature to bring
full charges against him.

12:45.991 --> 12:47.991
<i>Brigadefuhrer faber?</i>

12:52.831 --> 12:55.331
We are satisfied, thus far,

12:55.367 --> 12:57.667
That you have acted
in the interest of the reich,

12:57.702 --> 12:59.669
Pending a more thorough review.

12:59.704 --> 13:02.505
Of your files with our peers.
In the meantime,

13:02.541 --> 13:04.507
We will proceed
with immediate arrest.

13:04.543 --> 13:07.210
Of colonel sinclair.
With respect,

13:07.245 --> 13:09.612
As long as we have his son,
there is no need to detain him.

13:09.648 --> 13:11.614
How else will he work
as a double agent?

13:11.650 --> 13:13.983
You have done well
to get this far on your own,

13:14.019 --> 13:16.386
But turning
a high-ranking officer.

13:16.421 --> 13:18.388
Needs to be done
through the proper channels.

13:18.423 --> 13:22.191
I have built trust with sinclair. If you want
him alive, I must be the one to arrest him.

13:24.162 --> 13:27.463
Very well.
Bring him in immediately.

13:27.499 --> 13:30.700
And, franz, well done.

13:32.270 --> 13:34.270
<i>Heil hitler!</i>

14:04.736 --> 14:07.704
It's ok.

14:07.739 --> 14:09.706
You can play with them.

14:09.741 --> 14:12.141
Which one is your favourite?

14:18.283 --> 14:21.951
Sabine?

14:24.990 --> 14:26.723
Papa.

14:26.758 --> 14:29.692
'Bine, I've come to see if
you want to watch the parade.

14:29.728 --> 14:32.695
I'm sorry. I just think all the
travelling is catching up to me.

14:32.731 --> 14:35.765
Yes, of course. You should rest.

14:37.902 --> 14:40.136
I'd be happy to take dagna.

14:40.171 --> 14:42.305
There is a marching band,

14:42.340 --> 14:44.307
All the youth in their uniforms.

14:44.342 --> 14:47.010
It's very inspiring.
Where is she?

14:48.513 --> 14:51.180
Taking a nap.
I don't want to wake her.

14:51.216 --> 14:53.750
What a shame.

14:53.785 --> 14:56.953
Well, a little something
to make her feel welcome.

15:01.226 --> 15:03.192
It's beautiful.

15:08.967 --> 15:11.367
You must have a lot to do
to prepare for tonight.

15:11.403 --> 15:13.736
I can still help you settle in.

15:17.008 --> 15:20.176
You are sure you'll be
all right on your own?

15:20.211 --> 15:23.079
Of course. Franz will be
home soon if I need anything.

15:23.114 --> 15:25.281
Yes. I'm so glad
you've resolved things.

15:25.316 --> 15:27.316
He is a good man.

15:29.054 --> 15:31.220
He's truly impressing
his superiors here.

15:31.256 --> 15:34.557
Really? I shouldn't say, but,

15:34.592 --> 15:36.693
He has done the reich
a great service.

15:36.728 --> 15:40.463
How exciting.

15:42.367 --> 15:44.534
What does that mean? Rounding up.

15:44.569 --> 15:46.536
A nest of spies or something?

15:49.007 --> 15:51.274
Perhaps next year
it will be franz.

15:51.309 --> 15:53.342
Receiving a medal.

15:57.849 --> 15:59.882
Well, I'll call on you
tomorrow and see.

15:59.918 --> 16:02.919
If you're feeling better.
Thank you for the doll.

16:11.596 --> 16:14.731
It's all right.

16:18.236 --> 16:20.169
Just you and me now.

16:31.750 --> 16:34.884
Right. Give me the recording.
We're still two blocks away.

16:34.919 --> 16:36.686
You're staying put.
I'm taking it from here.

16:36.721 --> 16:39.689
Neil... you don't know what we're
walking into. You never even got.

16:39.724 --> 16:41.724
Proof of life.
The exchange is on my terms.

16:41.760 --> 16:44.427
He's not gonna risk
this recording going public.

16:44.462 --> 16:47.063
"Some lives
are worth more than others."

16:47.098 --> 16:51.100
pawns versus kings.

16:51.136 --> 16:53.703
Stay here, stay concealed.

16:53.738 --> 16:57.306
Ok? I'll bring your son back
to you. Give me the recording.

17:00.378 --> 17:02.445
Do you have a photo of william?

17:02.480 --> 17:04.547
<i>Sieg! Heil!</i>

17:04.582 --> 17:07.215
<i>Sieg! Sieg! Heil! Heil!</i>

17:07.252 --> 17:09.252
Thank you, neil.

17:11.656 --> 17:13.623
This is the one.

17:13.657 --> 17:15.657
It's going
to the reception hall?

17:15.693 --> 17:17.727
That's right. A stunning example.

17:17.762 --> 17:20.630
From the renaissance period.
I was hoping to send it out.

17:20.665 --> 17:23.633
For restoration the next month,
but the only craftsman.

17:23.667 --> 17:25.601
Skilled enough won't be
available anytime soon.

17:25.637 --> 17:29.038
Manfred, like you said, we don't have
much time. Sorry, it's all happening.

17:29.073 --> 17:31.774
Rather quickly.
Which piece will hang.

17:31.810 --> 17:34.577
In the library?
The library? This one.

17:34.612 --> 17:36.712
No, wait, sorry.
That's the main hall.

17:36.748 --> 17:38.915
This one.

17:38.950 --> 17:41.284
You're sure? Positive.

17:41.319 --> 17:42.752
When is the delivery
staff expected?

17:42.787 --> 17:44.887
A little over an hour.
Does that leave you.

17:44.923 --> 17:47.123
Enough time for...? Ample.

17:47.158 --> 17:48.936
Because I can't have
anyone walking in and seeing.

17:48.960 --> 17:50.827
Unaccredited individuals.
Of course not.

17:50.862 --> 17:52.995
I'd have trouble
explaining it of course.

17:53.031 --> 17:55.331
May I ask.

17:55.366 --> 17:57.333
What exactly it is
that you are intending to do?

17:57.368 --> 17:59.735
Some kind of listening device?
Why don't.

17:59.771 --> 18:01.737
We go talk in your office,
let my colleagues.

18:01.773 --> 18:03.406
Get a head start?

18:03.441 --> 18:04.841
Come.

18:54.626 --> 18:56.525
Where is sinclair?

18:56.561 --> 18:59.295
Where's sinclair junior?

18:59.330 --> 19:01.631
My arrangement was made
with your superior.

19:01.666 --> 19:04.634
And I'm the messenger.
The deal still stands.

19:04.669 --> 19:06.702
I get william;
You get the recording.

19:06.738 --> 19:08.871
I don't like plans changing.

19:08.907 --> 19:12.208
You and me both, mate.
Where is he?

19:40.972 --> 19:43.239
William sinclair?

19:46.711 --> 19:48.778
I work with your dad.

19:48.813 --> 19:50.813
I'm here to take you home.

19:57.522 --> 20:00.056
Ok, ok.

20:00.091 --> 20:02.625
It's ok, mate, I've got you.
Where is the recording?

20:09.400 --> 20:10.866
Don't play games!

20:18.609 --> 20:21.444
It's right here.

20:21.479 --> 20:24.413
Now we're even.

20:24.449 --> 20:26.415
Show us we were right.

20:26.451 --> 20:29.352
To trust you.

20:35.293 --> 20:37.660
Not much further. Nearly there.

21:05.456 --> 21:07.623
Go, go! Go this way! Come on!

21:07.658 --> 21:10.726
Halt! Halt! Halt!

21:10.762 --> 21:13.429
Don't move! It's ok. It's ok.

21:13.464 --> 21:15.598
Take them!

21:15.633 --> 21:17.933
Come here! Come on!

21:17.969 --> 21:20.503
Take all three.

21:24.784 --> 21:28.485
What are the odds do you think?

21:28.521 --> 21:30.420
Of?

21:30.456 --> 21:32.423
Of faber keeping
his word tonight.

21:32.457 --> 21:34.425
On principle.

21:34.459 --> 21:36.592
He's given us no reason
to doubt him.

21:36.629 --> 21:39.129
Why? I'm just concerned.

21:39.165 --> 21:41.899
That, as his handler,

21:41.934 --> 21:45.535
The other night when the two
of you were... Together,

21:45.571 --> 21:48.205
It might complicate
the relationship we've built.

21:48.239 --> 21:50.873
Nothing's changed.

21:50.909 --> 21:52.543
You don't know that.

21:52.578 --> 21:55.178
Heidi saw you in
a compromising situation.

21:55.214 --> 21:57.180
And I took care of it.

21:57.216 --> 21:59.116
That never should have happened.

21:59.150 --> 22:01.051
We had to clean up your mess!

22:01.087 --> 22:03.286
She was about to tell schmidt.

22:03.322 --> 22:05.599
Everything could have fallen
apart because the two of you.

22:05.623 --> 22:08.859
Weren't careful! But it didn't.

22:08.894 --> 22:10.861
I know what I'm doing, alfred.
Do you?

22:10.896 --> 22:13.197
Months of planning,
leveraging sabine, you working.

22:13.232 --> 22:16.399
To win schmidt's trust.
Harry gave his life for this.

22:16.435 --> 22:18.702
All of that could end up
being for nothing because.

22:18.737 --> 22:20.704
Of your relationship with faber.
My relationship?!

22:20.739 --> 22:23.072
Yeah. Not that it's my business.

22:23.109 --> 22:24.941
Unless you might be
losing perspective.

22:24.976 --> 22:26.922
Don't... Don't lecture me.
If it's distracting you.

22:26.946 --> 22:28.390
From the bigger picture.
I'm not lecturing;

22:28.414 --> 22:30.325
I'm just concerned about you.
I might be attracted to him?

22:30.349 --> 22:32.683
That he might be playing you,
using your trust...

22:32.717 --> 22:35.418
I told you.
I know what I'm doing.

22:35.454 --> 22:38.054
Really? Because I don't anymore.

22:38.090 --> 22:40.823
Know what you're doing, I mean.

22:40.860 --> 22:42.760
Right now,
I don't know who you are.

22:42.794 --> 22:46.130
You have no goddamn idea.

22:46.165 --> 22:48.165
What I've had to do
to get us this far.

22:48.199 --> 22:50.333
Everything I have done.

22:50.369 --> 22:53.070
Has been for the bigger picture.

22:53.104 --> 22:56.072
What is it?

22:56.108 --> 22:58.207
Nothing.

22:58.244 --> 23:01.311
What are you not telling me?
Nothing you need to know.

23:03.349 --> 23:05.314
This is what sinclair
warned me about.

23:05.351 --> 23:07.684
Your feelings for me.
So I was right.

23:07.719 --> 23:09.786
It was sinclair
who made you end things.

23:12.925 --> 23:14.891
We need to get this done.

23:14.927 --> 23:16.927
Yeah.

23:19.998 --> 23:23.478
You understand, I can't just let this happen
if I don't know what your intentions are...

23:23.502 --> 23:25.780
Really in your best interest
to know as little as possible.

23:25.804 --> 23:28.371
In case the gestapo
questions me?

23:28.407 --> 23:31.408
It just means
you have less to hide.

23:31.444 --> 23:33.243
You said that
I wouldn't be in any danger,

23:33.279 --> 23:35.245
That there was no risk!

23:35.281 --> 23:37.880
You're not!

23:37.917 --> 23:41.485
So it's not just some...
Listening devices or something.

23:46.659 --> 23:49.993
I have a wife and child.
Another child on the way.

23:50.029 --> 23:52.596
Can't risk their lives as well.
We all have.

23:52.630 --> 23:55.466
To take risks.

23:55.501 --> 23:58.235
Forging a few documents for
some helene bauer is one thing,

23:58.270 --> 24:01.138
But there are strangers
now downstairs doing.

24:01.173 --> 24:03.607
Illegal things with art pieces
that I offered to supply.

24:03.641 --> 24:05.641
How am I not guilty?

24:09.582 --> 24:13.115
I've changed my mind. You need
to tell your people to leave.

24:13.151 --> 24:15.352
Manfred... Do it now!

24:15.387 --> 24:17.921
Or I'll call my boss upstairs.

24:17.957 --> 24:21.157
His brother is an officer.
I'll tell him everything I know.

24:29.267 --> 24:32.870
You were right, neil.

24:32.905 --> 24:36.039
It was a long con.

24:36.075 --> 24:38.140
And now no one's safe
because of me.

24:38.177 --> 24:41.477
Ok. So what are we going.

24:41.514 --> 24:44.448
To do about it? Visitor for you.

24:44.483 --> 24:48.017
Will!

24:48.053 --> 24:50.320
Argh! Dad!

24:50.356 --> 24:53.323
Shhh. It's ok.

24:53.358 --> 24:56.994
It's ok. Shh. It's ok. It's ok.

24:57.028 --> 24:59.829
You're all right.

24:59.865 --> 25:02.698
You're all right.

25:02.735 --> 25:05.669
It's ok.

25:05.704 --> 25:07.671
It's all right.

25:07.706 --> 25:10.274
Tell your people to leave!
I can't do that.

25:10.309 --> 25:12.687
Too much has gone into this.
Tonight could change everything.

25:12.711 --> 25:14.811
Is it a bomb?

25:14.847 --> 25:16.812
Are you going after himmler?

25:16.849 --> 25:19.316
They'll come straight to me.

25:19.351 --> 25:21.919
They'll come knocking
at my door. And I tell you,

25:21.954 --> 25:24.074
I'll break, I'll tell them
everything. I'm not a hero!

25:25.524 --> 25:28.224
I'm sorry.
You need to leave now!

25:28.260 --> 25:30.861
Even if you report us,
you won't be spared.

25:30.896 --> 25:32.863
You've helped us in the past;
You're already.

25:32.898 --> 25:36.066
Guilty of treason.
I'll take that chance.

25:36.101 --> 25:38.101
They'll probably show me
some more leniency if I...

25:39.805 --> 25:42.039
Then don't. Tell them.

25:42.073 --> 25:45.841
The truth. Tell them that the
allied spies gave you no choice,

25:45.878 --> 25:48.678
That they know your 7-year-old
daughter liesbeth.

25:48.713 --> 25:52.381
Is at lietzensee elementary
school on schiffbauer street.

25:52.418 --> 25:54.351
Tell them they threatened
to kill her.

25:54.385 --> 25:56.352
If you don't cooperate.

25:56.387 --> 25:59.423
I never told you
my daughter's name.

25:59.457 --> 26:01.758
Manfred?

26:01.794 --> 26:04.894
It's him. I have to tell him.

26:04.930 --> 26:08.731
Don't. Manfred?

26:14.840 --> 26:18.742
Manfred, I'm missing
one of the master lists.

26:22.481 --> 26:24.146
Is everything all right?

26:27.151 --> 26:30.653
What is it, manfred?
You don't look well.

26:30.689 --> 26:33.523
It's almost over, will.
Look how far you've made it.

26:36.361 --> 26:38.928
What's going on?
It's a long story.

26:38.963 --> 26:41.564
How are you even here?
It's a long story.

26:41.599 --> 26:43.899
I'll tell you later.

26:43.936 --> 26:46.535
I just didn't know
if you were still alive or not.

26:48.539 --> 26:52.108
And sometimes, just the hope...

26:52.144 --> 26:54.276
Just the hope
that you were still out there,

26:54.312 --> 26:57.180
That's the only thing I had.

27:00.718 --> 27:02.986
How's ollie?

27:03.021 --> 27:05.021
Have you heard from him?

27:07.226 --> 27:09.992
Do I have a hawaiian nephew yet?

27:15.501 --> 27:18.267
There was an attack, will.

27:21.506 --> 27:23.506
Ollie was killed in action.

27:23.541 --> 27:26.543
I'm so sorry.

27:36.055 --> 27:38.320
You should sit down. No.

27:38.356 --> 27:41.024
I insist.
There's no need. I'm not sick.

27:41.059 --> 27:43.727
Then what is it?

27:49.901 --> 27:51.867
I've had too much to drink.

27:51.903 --> 27:55.005
Manfred. Today of all days.

27:55.039 --> 27:58.008
Yes. I'm...

27:58.043 --> 27:59.910
I have a problem with drinking.

27:59.945 --> 28:02.144
<i>When I'm under pressure.
Get fraulein weber.</i>

28:02.180 --> 28:04.146
To fetch you
a strong cup of coffee.

28:04.182 --> 28:06.550
And pull yourself together.
It's a day.

28:06.584 --> 28:08.418
Of national pride
for heaven's sake.

28:08.454 --> 28:10.419
We cannot afford mistakes.
I know, I know.

28:10.456 --> 28:13.323
I'm sorry.
I'll be back in 20 minutes,

28:13.358 --> 28:15.758
And we'll pretend
this never happened.

28:24.970 --> 28:26.936
Well done, manfred.

28:26.972 --> 28:29.673
I knew you could do it.

28:29.707 --> 28:31.575
Here.

28:33.611 --> 28:36.780
You need to sober up.

28:43.655 --> 28:47.090
Remember when
your mother was sick.

28:47.126 --> 28:49.126
And I could barely cope?

28:49.160 --> 28:51.528
You were so strong, will.

28:51.562 --> 28:54.664
You were so strong for ollie.

28:54.700 --> 28:56.966
You were so strong for me.
Now I would not have.

28:57.001 --> 29:00.470
Made it through without you.
We have to do that again,

29:00.506 --> 29:03.206
Both of us.

29:03.242 --> 29:05.474
We have to be that strong, son.

29:07.412 --> 29:10.447
I've been strong a long time.

29:10.481 --> 29:12.883
I know you have. Just a little longer.
You, come here!

29:12.918 --> 29:15.619
Let's go!
No. Don't let them take me.

29:15.653 --> 29:19.088
Again, please. No, please! No!
I'm right here.

29:19.124 --> 29:21.925
I can't do it again! Dad! I'm right
here with you. You're not alone!

29:21.959 --> 29:24.727
Dad! Dad! You're not alone!

29:24.762 --> 29:27.164
No! You're not alone!

29:27.198 --> 29:30.399
Franz! Where are you going?

29:30.434 --> 29:32.968
To see my prisoner.
I need some time with sinclair.

29:33.005 --> 29:35.305
Before we involve the others
in the conversation.

29:35.340 --> 29:37.506
That won't be necessary.

29:37.543 --> 29:39.476
I know the man.
He will be more responsive.

29:39.510 --> 29:41.845
If I begin the negotiations.
Sinclair will not be turned.

29:43.916 --> 29:46.582
<i>Oberst-gruppenfuhrer kohler
has decided.</i>

29:46.617 --> 29:48.818
To take a different approach.

29:48.854 --> 29:52.322
Sinclair will be interrogated
and then executed.

29:52.356 --> 29:56.358
That man is an unlimited
intelligence source.

29:56.394 --> 29:59.396
There are rumours that our fortunes
in russia are beginning to turn.

29:59.430 --> 30:01.497
We need good news.
Sacrificing him for propaganda.

30:01.532 --> 30:03.767
Is a short-sighted waste
of our most valuable asset!

30:03.802 --> 30:07.537
Kohler believes their plan's value
outweighs the risk of releasing him.

30:07.573 --> 30:09.539
In the field as a double agent.

30:09.575 --> 30:11.841
There is no risk
as long as we have his son!

30:11.876 --> 30:14.311
Which is why sinclair will talk.

30:14.345 --> 30:16.512
As soon as we begin torturing
the boy in front of him.

30:16.548 --> 30:20.216
We're already softening him
with a family reunion.

30:20.251 --> 30:22.919
We captured an additional spy.

30:22.954 --> 30:25.521
<i>Perhaps that man can be executed
and brigadefuhrer faber.</i>

30:25.557 --> 30:27.490
Could still pursue his work
with sinclair.

30:27.526 --> 30:30.459
Their minds are made up.
Your man here.

30:30.495 --> 30:32.361
Can start interrogation
on the brit.

30:32.396 --> 30:34.296
And, in the meantime,
why don't you.

30:34.332 --> 30:37.367
<i>Return to your responsibilities
to obergruppenfuhrer schmidt.</i>

30:46.077 --> 30:48.912
That's impossible.
In the middle of the day?

30:48.947 --> 30:51.247
They wouldn't. It's a drill.

30:53.584 --> 30:56.052
Security protocol one!

30:56.088 --> 30:58.088
Proceed to the closest shelter.
Go! Let's go!

30:58.122 --> 30:59.823
Security protocol one!

30:59.858 --> 31:01.691
Air raid. Yes.

31:01.727 --> 31:03.760
Then we have to go.
Shh, it's fine.

31:03.794 --> 31:06.195
I can't stay here.
You just sit down.

31:06.231 --> 31:08.198
You'll be fine.?

31:08.233 --> 31:10.200
It's not safe here. Just lie...

31:10.235 --> 31:12.202
We have to get to the shelter.

31:12.236 --> 31:14.204
Shhh. You're just gonna
sleep a little.

31:14.238 --> 31:16.573
Shhh. Rest.

31:16.608 --> 31:18.841
We need to go.

31:56.289 --> 31:59.623
We need to go.
Yeah, almost there.

32:02.028 --> 32:03.994
It's fine. It looks fine!
Fine's not good enough.

32:04.030 --> 32:05.996
We get one shot at this.

32:06.032 --> 32:07.765
Give me a hand.

32:13.806 --> 32:16.340
Alfred, you've got
to help me with this!

32:21.814 --> 32:24.915
Green light! Come on! Everybody,
let's go, go, go, go, go!

32:24.951 --> 32:27.752
Jump or I'll bloody
throw you out.

32:29.088 --> 32:31.188
Alfred!

32:31.224 --> 32:33.791
Alfred, look at me!
Look at me, alfred!

32:33.826 --> 32:36.527
You're fine.
Just come with me. Yeah?

32:36.562 --> 32:38.863
Come, come.

32:41.801 --> 32:45.169
It's safe here.
You don't need to worry.

32:45.204 --> 32:47.438
I'll be right back, all right?

32:51.878 --> 32:54.111
I won't leave you. I promise.

33:34.454 --> 33:36.387
How does the next part go?

33:51.838 --> 33:55.105
A daylight raid?

33:55.141 --> 33:58.175
Raf sending a message to let
them know we're coming for 'em.

33:58.211 --> 34:00.177
You knew? Not the details.

34:02.515 --> 34:05.816
This is bad news. If the
city's under fire, then they'll.

34:05.852 --> 34:08.030
Cancel the ceremony tonight.
No, it's a contained attack.

34:08.054 --> 34:10.054
Nazis will downplay everything.

34:10.089 --> 34:12.322
They want to maintain the myth
that they're untouchable.

34:12.358 --> 34:14.525
The show must go on.

34:14.560 --> 34:17.061
Which could work for us now.

34:17.096 --> 34:19.330
They'll be understaffed.

34:21.199 --> 34:23.601
I need you to know.

34:23.636 --> 34:26.036
That sending peter and david,

34:26.072 --> 34:28.205
Sending those two boys to die,
was the hardest thing.

34:28.241 --> 34:31.587
That I've ever had to do in my life, but it
was the only way this mission would survive.

34:31.610 --> 34:34.678
Stopping operation marigold is
more important than you or me.

34:34.714 --> 34:37.681
It's more important
than william.

34:37.717 --> 34:40.217
Get the prisoner out!
They're gonna torture.

34:40.253 --> 34:43.053
My son in front of me, neil,
and when they do, I will talk.

34:43.089 --> 34:45.255
And that can't happen.

34:45.291 --> 34:48.559
I'm gonna buy you
some time to get out.

34:48.594 --> 34:50.928
I'm not leaving you here.
They need me alive.

34:50.963 --> 34:53.496
I can hold them off.

34:59.572 --> 35:02.273
You're ok.

35:04.377 --> 35:06.710
Alfred, you're ok.

35:06.746 --> 35:08.712
I'm right here.

35:12.718 --> 35:15.419
Are you?

35:15.454 --> 35:18.422
I am.

35:20.560 --> 35:23.127
What is it
that you were afraid to tell me?

35:25.798 --> 35:27.765
Don't do this to yourself;
Let me help you.

35:27.800 --> 35:29.733
I don't want you to remember me.

35:29.769 --> 35:31.769
As that.

35:31.804 --> 35:33.671
As what?

35:37.276 --> 35:39.376
A monster.

35:39.412 --> 35:42.546
The reason why I went.

35:42.582 --> 35:45.249
To faber that once?

35:45.284 --> 35:48.419
I did something terrible,

35:48.454 --> 35:50.454
And I couldn't face you.

35:53.059 --> 35:55.025
Nothing you can say changes.

35:55.061 --> 35:57.428
How I feel about you.

35:57.463 --> 36:00.130
I killed an innocent man...

36:02.134 --> 36:04.101
At schmidt's party.

36:04.136 --> 36:06.737
One of the jewish servants,

36:06.772 --> 36:08.772
I murdered him.

36:12.378 --> 36:14.478
And for what?

36:19.018 --> 36:22.019
To impress a nazi.

36:22.054 --> 36:24.355
I see his face.

36:24.390 --> 36:26.357
Whenever I close my eyes.

36:26.392 --> 36:29.593
He's just... He's so.

36:29.629 --> 36:32.830
Afraid and so...

36:32.865 --> 36:36.133
So helpless. And I think

36:36.168 --> 36:38.335
I did that.

36:42.541 --> 36:44.975
I'm no better than any of them.

36:50.816 --> 36:52.816
I don't know who I am anymore.

36:55.187 --> 36:58.455
That wasn't you.

36:58.491 --> 37:01.892
That wasn't you
who did those things.

37:01.927 --> 37:03.927
That was helene bauer.

37:06.432 --> 37:08.399
I know you.

37:08.434 --> 37:10.668
I know who you are.

37:12.905 --> 37:16.573
You're aurora.

37:16.609 --> 37:19.543
You are aurora.

37:41.342 --> 37:43.976
Out of the cell.

37:44.011 --> 37:46.412
Move! Now!

37:49.917 --> 37:52.651
Bring him out.

37:56.357 --> 37:57.923
Argh!

38:02.029 --> 38:04.797
Go! I'll distract them as long as I can.
Leave you here?

38:04.832 --> 38:06.899
Go! You think I'll start
following your orders now?

38:06.934 --> 38:09.869
You gotta get aurora to
the finish line. Please, neil!

38:20.148 --> 38:21.580
Sir.

38:23.151 --> 38:24.550
Be safe.

38:38.933 --> 38:40.866
This way! Follow me!

38:42.270 --> 38:44.236
Get away!

38:49.877 --> 38:52.912
Get down! Go! Go!

38:52.947 --> 38:55.481
Come on! Let me out of here!
Shoot!

39:09.630 --> 39:11.597
This way, come on!

39:11.632 --> 39:14.433
Hold here! Hold him there!

39:14.468 --> 39:17.903
Hold your fire! Hold your fire!

39:21.409 --> 39:23.409
This prisoner
must be taken alive!

39:25.413 --> 39:27.379
Sinclair, you know.

39:27.415 --> 39:29.548
There's nowhere for you to go.

39:29.584 --> 39:31.784
Sinclair! I hear you.

39:31.819 --> 39:33.986
You don't want to make
things worse for william.

39:34.021 --> 39:36.689
Don't touch him! We won't.

39:38.159 --> 39:41.594
If you cooperate.
I don't trust you.

39:43.598 --> 39:45.631
I am giving you
a chance to protect him.

39:45.666 --> 39:49.335
Surrender and he will
not be harmed.

39:49.370 --> 39:51.337
I have your word?

39:51.372 --> 39:53.873
You do.

39:55.643 --> 39:56.942
All right.

40:02.016 --> 40:03.816
Let's talk.

40:03.851 --> 40:07.019
Find the other prisoner
and bring him back alive.

40:13.928 --> 40:15.961
Get where we can see you.

40:15.997 --> 40:18.197
And keep your hands raised.

40:31.512 --> 40:33.979
You're a smart man,

40:34.015 --> 40:35.881
Thinking about your son,

40:35.917 --> 40:38.884
Making the right choices
for him.

41:00.408 --> 41:03.275
I should go.

41:03.311 --> 41:05.344
Schmidt's car will be
at the hotel soon.

41:07.348 --> 41:09.815
Go. I'll finish
with the painting.

41:09.850 --> 41:11.216
Ok.

41:20.728 --> 41:22.928
Thank you.

41:30.504 --> 41:33.038
Good luck.

41:33.074 --> 41:34.873
I'll see you at the safe house.

41:34.909 --> 41:36.875
Right. In a few hours.

41:36.911 --> 41:39.945
Yeah.

41:39.981 --> 41:42.014
Go. I will.

41:45.052 --> 41:47.019
Don't look back.

41:47.054 --> 41:49.188
I won't.

42:05.406 --> 42:08.040
Come down here! Go!

42:08.075 --> 42:10.409
Come this way!

42:12.413 --> 42:15.581
Look for him!

42:24.525 --> 42:27.726
Stay where you are!

42:49.816 --> 42:50.649
Let me live,

42:50.750 --> 42:51.817
I'll give you

42:52.305 --> 42:58.719
