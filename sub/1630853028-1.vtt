WEBVTT

00:06.006 --> 00:07.341
His vitals are dropping.
We're losing him.

00:07.425 --> 00:08.259
We really want to upload.

00:08.342 --> 00:10.845
We could be together forever.

00:10.928 --> 00:12.763
You are so amazing,

00:12.847 --> 00:15.516
but forever is just,
like, so long.

00:16.726 --> 00:18.310
Can we just hit the "pause"
button here for a second?

00:21.605 --> 00:24.442
Hello, Nathan. Welcome to
Lakeview, you lucky duck.

00:24.525 --> 00:26.193
- Yeah.
- This is the first day

00:26.277 --> 00:28.070
of the rest of your afterlife.

00:30.948 --> 00:32.950
Quack, quack.

00:33.033 --> 00:34.535
Bop, bop, bop, bop, bop.

00:35.536 --> 00:36.787
Ew!

00:36.871 --> 00:38.122
Anytime you need me,
I'll be here for you.

00:38.205 --> 00:39.915
- Ow, ow, ow, ow.
- Cute.

00:39.999 --> 00:42.251
He might be a good guy.

00:44.628 --> 00:46.338
You know, for an L.A. douchebag,

00:46.422 --> 00:48.966
you're the best L.A. douchebag
I've ever met.

00:49.925 --> 00:51.594
- What did you do?
- My friend and I are making

00:51.677 --> 00:53.179
an app, it's called...

00:53.262 --> 00:54.513
You're blanking on the name
of your own app?

00:54.597 --> 00:56.432
Why are my memories deleted?

00:56.515 --> 00:58.142
Did you cut some kind of deal
to push me out, so you could

00:58.225 --> 01:00.686
- sell the company to Freeyond?
- That code that you made,

01:00.770 --> 01:02.605
we would be willing to pay
a significant amount

01:02.688 --> 01:04.064
for just a copy.

01:04.148 --> 01:06.192
So you got murdered.

01:06.275 --> 01:07.735
I was in a car accident.

01:07.818 --> 01:09.153
Sure.

01:09.236 --> 01:11.530
You just threatened
a $600-billion-a-year industry

01:11.614 --> 01:14.074
- and no one murdered you.
- He sold his dream

01:14.158 --> 01:16.160
for money and then got
murdered to cover it up.

01:17.286 --> 01:19.413
- Help me!
- I have some friends
that are big in

01:19.497 --> 01:20.706
the Ludd movement.
I can hide you in the mountains

01:20.790 --> 01:22.333
in a house completely
off the grid.

01:22.416 --> 01:24.418
Car, Poconos.

01:25.252 --> 01:26.337
Ingrid?

01:26.420 --> 01:28.881
I'm here now.
I uploaded.

01:28.964 --> 01:31.383
- For you.
- What?!

01:31.467 --> 01:32.885
Nathan?!

01:39.892 --> 01:42.770
The consciousness
of an uploaded pigeon

01:42.853 --> 01:45.648
has been successfully
downloaded into

01:45.731 --> 01:49.568
a new clone pigeon, say
researchers at Panera-U Penn,

01:49.652 --> 01:52.863
admitting they should have
started with a pigeon,

01:52.947 --> 01:55.324
not a human in the first place.

01:55.407 --> 01:58.869
Enthusiasm is still high
for the big Freeyond opening

01:58.953 --> 02:00.871
this week with long lines

02:00.955 --> 02:03.123
at all eight
Philadelphia locations.

02:03.207 --> 02:05.084
Want the romantic
weekend package?

02:05.167 --> 02:07.920
Comes with hot water
and a squirt of bubble bath.

02:08.003 --> 02:09.630
Hey, I'll take that.

02:09.713 --> 02:10.840
Just another 500.

02:10.923 --> 02:13.676
Ouch.

02:32.027 --> 02:33.362
You want to say bye to Byron?

02:33.445 --> 02:35.364
Oh, God no.

02:36.615 --> 02:40.160
Do we really need
these head condoms?

02:40.244 --> 02:42.746
Yeah, if you don't want
to be face ID'd by a drone.

02:44.582 --> 02:47.084
Um, actually, wait.

03:03.267 --> 03:05.769
Ghost boyfriend
still ghosting you?

03:33.923 --> 03:35.424
Car, go another mile

03:35.507 --> 03:36.926
and return to New York.

03:37.009 --> 03:38.552
Yes, Mr. Patakoupolis.

03:38.636 --> 03:40.763
Mr. Patakoupolis?

03:49.813 --> 03:51.815
Keep up, city girl.

03:53.150 --> 03:54.735
Take a deep breath.

03:54.818 --> 03:57.029
Fresh air, trees.

03:57.112 --> 03:59.657
It's like Lakeview, only real.

04:07.206 --> 04:10.125
Come on.

04:10.209 --> 04:12.461
Remember, no tech allowed
where we're going.

04:12.544 --> 04:15.005
They'll take that phone of yours
and melt it into something

04:15.089 --> 04:17.675
useful, like a chess piece
or a scrunchie.

04:37.152 --> 04:39.238
When was the last time
you saw a doctor, Dad?

04:39.321 --> 04:40.823
I screen-chatted with GoogleMD.

04:40.906 --> 04:42.282
It was very hopeful.

04:42.366 --> 04:44.702
Then I started getting
these ads for funeral homes.

04:44.785 --> 04:46.537
- And I was like--
- Dad!

04:46.620 --> 04:48.831
It's okay. He's one of us.

04:48.914 --> 04:49.957
Tech?

04:50.040 --> 04:51.875
I sold my last bit
off this morning.

04:51.959 --> 04:53.293
Uh-huh.

04:53.377 --> 04:54.670
You?

04:54.753 --> 04:56.338
I left my phone in the car.

04:57.923 --> 04:59.591
No, I-I can manage it.

04:59.675 --> 05:01.218
We're another
two hours out, Dave.

05:01.301 --> 05:03.345
Come on.

05:03.429 --> 05:05.973
- Like, walking?

05:06.056 --> 05:08.851
Like, two hours walking?

05:20.320 --> 05:21.989
Ms. Kannerman?

05:22.072 --> 05:23.490
I am not your regular angel.

05:23.574 --> 05:25.159
She's running
a tiny bit late this morning.

05:25.242 --> 05:27.411
But I am filling in
as best I can.

05:27.494 --> 05:30.247
Oh, no, is it a little stressful
for you today?

05:30.330 --> 05:32.416
Spare me-- I'm dead, okay?

05:32.499 --> 05:34.334
- I win.
- Of course...

05:34.418 --> 05:35.544
- I'm sorry,

05:35.627 --> 05:37.629
I have to put you on hold.

05:41.341 --> 05:42.885
Yes?

05:42.968 --> 05:45.804
Hey, is there some trick
to getting out of the chimney?

05:50.309 --> 05:52.352
I got bored, I missed Nathan.

05:52.436 --> 05:54.063
Come on!

05:56.315 --> 05:57.316
Thank you.

05:57.399 --> 05:59.943
Do not call me again--
I'm busy.

06:01.904 --> 06:03.530
Angel?

06:04.823 --> 06:06.450
You said do call you or don't--?

06:06.533 --> 06:08.410
- Don't!
- Okay, yeah, right.

06:08.494 --> 06:09.995
Okay, well, I got it.

06:10.079 --> 06:13.749
Angel...

06:13.832 --> 06:14.917
hair pasta.

06:15.000 --> 06:17.669
Hey, what are you doing here?

06:17.753 --> 06:19.922
I was just saying
my favorite pasta is an--

06:20.005 --> 06:22.049
- Oh, now I see what happened.

06:22.132 --> 06:24.718
Ow!

06:24.802 --> 06:27.137
I deserve that.

07:03.382 --> 07:04.967
That's gonna be you.

07:05.050 --> 07:07.219
Oh, thank God.

07:08.220 --> 07:10.639
Noni, I'm gonna crash.

07:12.015 --> 07:14.351
Why don't you have
a look around?

07:53.056 --> 07:55.517
Do you reject technology

07:55.601 --> 07:57.895
and all its empty promises?

07:57.978 --> 08:00.063
We do!

08:00.147 --> 08:02.649
You may receive the dirt.

08:02.733 --> 08:04.735
Dirt for simplicity.

08:04.818 --> 08:08.071
Dirt, which destroys
the computer chips.

08:08.155 --> 08:09.573
Technology is sin.

08:09.656 --> 08:11.909
What grosses you out more?

08:11.992 --> 08:14.203
The religious part
or the sexism?

08:14.286 --> 08:17.080
Oh, I think you're
misinterpreting my look.

08:17.164 --> 08:19.291
I can't wait to be
a part of this...

08:19.374 --> 08:22.544
patriarchal,
backwoods creep show.

08:22.628 --> 08:24.338
Yeah.

08:24.421 --> 08:26.590
That's just Pastor Rob.

08:26.673 --> 08:28.592
But Ludds are not all like that.

08:28.675 --> 08:31.220
Wow. Are those unprinted?

08:31.303 --> 08:33.430
Of course.

08:33.513 --> 08:36.391
I had a window box back home,
but my Monsanto seeds

08:36.475 --> 08:37.768
didn't grow much without a code.

08:37.851 --> 08:40.479
Yeah, our seeds are heirloom,

08:40.562 --> 08:42.064
from before the monopoly.

08:42.147 --> 08:44.524
I'm Matteo.

08:44.608 --> 08:47.986
It's like Matt except I got
beat up a lot as a kid.

08:50.072 --> 08:52.741
Nora.

08:52.824 --> 08:54.952
This all seems a little much.

08:55.994 --> 08:58.789
How do you deal
with the whackjobs in charge?

08:58.872 --> 09:02.709
Well, you probably don't have
to think about this in the city,

09:02.793 --> 09:06.672
but out here, we have
to plant, grow, gather, cook.

09:06.755 --> 09:11.093
So... I'm just thinking
about food 24-7.

09:11.176 --> 09:14.054
Yeah, even in the city
I think about food 24-7.

09:14.137 --> 09:16.640
- That's right!
- Mission accomplished.

09:18.725 --> 09:21.019
Hey, Chris, what'd you hit?

09:21.103 --> 09:22.479
Freeyond!

09:22.562 --> 09:24.189
Blew the demo
to hell on a livestream.

09:24.273 --> 09:26.275
No grand opening now.

09:26.358 --> 09:29.152
Wait, why pick on Freeyond?
They're the good guys.

09:29.236 --> 09:32.781
Yeah, uh...
most of us are in favor

09:32.864 --> 09:36.368
of universal digital afterlife.
Pastor Rob hates all upload.

09:36.451 --> 09:38.537
I got to talk to him
'cause this is bullshit.

09:38.620 --> 09:40.289
We're supposed to vote
on stuff like this.

09:42.249 --> 09:44.459
Phantom phone.

09:44.543 --> 09:46.503
You get over it.

09:47.546 --> 09:49.589
All right, tech junkie.

09:49.673 --> 09:52.175
Here's where you learn
how to smell the roses again.

09:52.259 --> 09:54.052
Any more questions?

09:54.136 --> 09:56.388
Oh, and no, we don't do phones,

09:56.471 --> 09:58.098
but that doesn't mean
you can't communicate

09:58.181 --> 09:59.474
with your loved ones.

09:59.558 --> 10:00.976
Oh, have you ever seen

10:01.059 --> 10:03.353
one of these?

10:03.437 --> 10:06.481
- It's an envelope.
- What is that?

10:06.565 --> 10:08.942
It's how your ancestors
got spam.

10:10.527 --> 10:13.071
Hand in your letters Friday
evening and one of us will

10:13.155 --> 10:14.948
mail them
in Tannersville next day.

10:15.032 --> 10:16.908
Oh, oh, good.

10:16.992 --> 10:20.287
Everybody, this is Matteo,
one of our community leaders.

10:20.370 --> 10:22.664
Please give him a warm welcome.

10:25.000 --> 10:28.545
Thanks. Hi.

10:28.628 --> 10:31.089
So, uh, I know you're
probably wondering

10:31.173 --> 10:33.175
what type of whackjobs
run this place.

10:34.760 --> 10:37.262
Well, I am one of them.
I'm from Oakland.

10:37.346 --> 10:40.015
So I've seen what Big Tech
can do to small communities.

10:40.098 --> 10:42.517
Worse, what it can do
to the planet.

10:42.601 --> 10:45.270
Distribute lies, guzzle carbon,

10:45.354 --> 10:47.564
sow discord,
make the rich richer.

10:47.647 --> 10:49.775
And it tries
to suppress the working class,

10:49.858 --> 10:52.611
which I believe is probably
all of us in this room.

10:52.694 --> 10:55.489
So you've come
to the right place.

10:55.572 --> 10:56.865
A very special place.

10:56.948 --> 10:59.117
I'm really happy you're here.
This is gonna be...

10:59.201 --> 11:01.286
...a whole new
chapter in your lives.

11:01.370 --> 11:03.455
So, welcome, I'm Nora.

11:03.538 --> 11:05.916
Don't worry,
I'm here to guide you.

11:05.999 --> 11:08.001
I've only been here
a few weeks myself,

11:08.085 --> 11:11.213
but I feel like
I've been here my whole life.

11:11.296 --> 11:13.673
No, we don't do phones
or other tech,

11:13.757 --> 11:16.134
but you can still keep
in touch with your loved ones

11:16.218 --> 11:18.095
using an ancient magic.

11:18.178 --> 11:19.513
This, newbies,

11:19.596 --> 11:21.723
is an envelope.

11:21.807 --> 11:23.141
That's right, Nora.

11:23.225 --> 11:24.851
It's how our grandparents paid

11:24.935 --> 11:26.395
- the fax bill.

11:26.478 --> 11:28.271
Hey, that was my line.

11:28.355 --> 11:31.066
But, anyway, write your letters

11:31.149 --> 11:33.068
by Friday and we can
put them in the mail

11:33.151 --> 11:34.945
by the following Monday.

11:35.028 --> 11:37.030
And this is Matteo.

11:37.114 --> 11:39.408
A community leader
that isn't afraid

11:39.491 --> 11:41.076
to get his hands dirty.

11:41.159 --> 11:42.828
Or make sassy comments.

11:42.911 --> 11:45.455
- I am not sassy.
- He said sassily.

11:46.832 --> 11:48.500
Uh, nice to meet you guys.

11:56.550 --> 11:59.845
Oh, Nathan Brown is back
from 2Gigs!

11:59.928 --> 12:02.848
- Welcome back, Mr. Brown!

12:02.931 --> 12:06.184
So there will be two guests
from now on in our suite,

12:06.268 --> 12:08.854
10556, which means
double everything.

12:08.937 --> 12:10.689
- Two sinks.
- Of course.

12:10.772 --> 12:13.608
There are already two sinks;
would you like four sinks?

12:13.692 --> 12:16.153
No, that's ridiculous.

12:16.236 --> 12:17.863
Two beds, as well?

12:17.946 --> 12:19.656
- Oh, my God, you're a moron.
- Just...

12:19.739 --> 12:21.199
Let me speak to a manager.

12:21.283 --> 12:23.452
Very well. Hup.

12:23.535 --> 12:25.245
What seems to be the problem?

12:25.328 --> 12:28.081
- Angel?
- Yes?

12:28.165 --> 12:29.875
Where's Nora?

12:29.958 --> 12:31.751
You tell me. It's been weeks

12:31.835 --> 12:33.253
since she disappeared
without saying boo.

12:33.336 --> 12:35.589
- "Weeks"? I've been
frozen in 2Gig.
- Yes.

12:35.672 --> 12:37.799
Ingrid must have left me there.
I need to talk to Nora.

12:37.883 --> 12:40.677
Well, Horizen is saying
she's on a leave of absence.

12:40.760 --> 12:42.929
I call and call,
she doesn't pick up the phone.

12:43.013 --> 12:44.806
Oh, shit, that's not good.

12:44.890 --> 12:46.433
No, it is not good.

12:46.516 --> 12:49.269
Now I have all of her old
clients on top of my own.

12:49.352 --> 12:52.689
Including one extremely
difficult Karen.

12:52.772 --> 12:55.358
- Oh, there you are.
- Mm-hmm.

12:55.442 --> 12:56.902
Please adjust the temperature
of our room

12:56.985 --> 12:58.570
to Mediterranean summer evening,

12:58.653 --> 13:02.199
then lay out rose petals on the
bed but in the shape of a rose,

13:02.282 --> 13:03.950
not a heart--
that's very important.

13:05.368 --> 13:07.996
Hello, hi, hi, right here.

13:08.079 --> 13:10.540
Are you taking notes
in there or...?

13:10.624 --> 13:12.250
Got it. So a rose, extra thorns.

13:13.668 --> 13:15.378
Can you believe this bitch?

13:15.462 --> 13:17.255
Don't complain.
They are recording.

13:17.339 --> 13:19.132
Well, I'm just saying
how many pairs

13:19.216 --> 13:20.842
of shoes does one upload need?

13:20.926 --> 13:23.595
- Ingrid Kannerman is
a lovely woman.
- Aleesha!

13:23.678 --> 13:24.638
My office.

13:24.721 --> 13:27.057
Now, please.

13:28.892 --> 13:30.644
Why didn't you wake
me up sooner?

13:30.727 --> 13:33.021
'Cause I needed time
to redecorate.

13:33.104 --> 13:34.898
I was frozen for two weeks.

13:34.981 --> 13:37.651
Babe, that's how long it took
to program our special bed.

13:37.734 --> 13:40.403
It's the width of a king,
but the length of a queen.

13:40.487 --> 13:42.531
What? Why would anyone want--?

13:42.614 --> 13:44.407
No, no, no, no.

13:44.491 --> 13:46.284
Stop stalling. What do you know?

13:46.368 --> 13:47.744
Know?

13:47.827 --> 13:49.621
- I don't know anything.
- Last time I saw you,

13:49.704 --> 13:51.414
you said you needed to
own my scan

13:51.498 --> 13:52.874
to protect me.
Protect me from who?

13:52.958 --> 13:54.793
Oh, my God, you are

13:54.876 --> 13:56.878
so obsessed with this
"being murdered" thing.

13:56.962 --> 13:58.213
Wouldn't you be?!

13:58.296 --> 14:00.006
If I cared about my own life

14:00.090 --> 14:01.883
more than this relationship,

14:01.967 --> 14:04.344
would I have uploaded for you?

14:05.762 --> 14:07.514
I didn't ask you to do that.

14:07.597 --> 14:10.475
I gave up my friends, my future.

14:10.559 --> 14:13.228
Not to mention a body
I worked really hard for.

14:13.311 --> 14:14.854
Oh, your body's the same.

14:14.938 --> 14:17.023
No, it is not! How dare you!

14:17.107 --> 14:18.733
I was so much more slammin'

14:18.817 --> 14:20.443
in so many different places.

14:20.527 --> 14:22.237
And I think you know it.
I mean, don't even talk to me

14:22.320 --> 14:25.073
about my shoulder blades.
They are insanely flat.

14:25.156 --> 14:27.742
- I can't do this
right now, so...
- Was it something I said?

14:27.826 --> 14:29.661
- Yes.
- Babe?

14:29.744 --> 14:32.664
- Okay. Yeah.
- Let me know
if you need anything.

14:36.376 --> 14:38.461
Call Nora.

14:40.505 --> 14:43.008
Oh, please, pick up,
pick up, pick up, pick up.

14:52.517 --> 14:54.644
You are such a piece of shit.

14:54.728 --> 14:57.147
- Excuse me?
- Not you!

14:58.523 --> 15:00.317
Okay.

15:00.400 --> 15:02.193
I'll be right back.

15:02.277 --> 15:04.112
Okay, before you say anything,

15:04.195 --> 15:07.240
this new client Ingrid Kannerman
is a total headcase.

15:07.324 --> 15:10.910
Ingrid is what we call
"an elite customer."

15:10.994 --> 15:14.039
And when you pay that kind
of money, Leeshy--

15:14.122 --> 15:16.833
Aleesha. Is that why I don't
have access to her settings?

15:16.916 --> 15:19.252
I can't put her
to sleep or anything.

15:19.336 --> 15:22.339
And, trust, if I could,
she'd wake up once a year.

15:22.422 --> 15:24.758
Have you seen the crystal
thigh-highs she wears?

15:25.800 --> 15:28.637
10K per boot.

15:28.720 --> 15:30.138
- Damn!
- Yep.

15:30.221 --> 15:32.390
So...

15:32.474 --> 15:35.226
- Okay.
- ...I'm giving you a promotion.

15:35.310 --> 15:37.771
How is this even fair?
Wait, what?

15:37.854 --> 15:40.148
Mm-hmm, to junior manager.

15:40.231 --> 15:43.151
Did I just get a promotion
by complaining?

15:43.234 --> 15:45.028
I'm actually shutting you up
with more money.

15:45.111 --> 15:46.946
And you can hire
a temp to help you.

15:47.030 --> 15:48.782
Wow. Thank you.

15:48.865 --> 15:50.992
- You're welcome. Yeah.
- Thank you, Lucy.

15:51.076 --> 15:52.661
I will do a great job.

15:52.744 --> 15:54.120
- Yes, you will.
- Yeah.

15:54.204 --> 15:55.497
Yeah.

15:58.625 --> 16:00.502
- Mimosa, Nathan?
- No.

16:00.585 --> 16:01.628
Okay.

16:06.966 --> 16:08.551
You like my new face, right?

16:09.969 --> 16:11.805
You think I should reinstall
my old face?

16:11.888 --> 16:13.598
- No.
- Hmm.

16:13.682 --> 16:15.600
My nose was so pointy.

16:15.684 --> 16:18.937
Like, like Hedy Lamarr

16:19.020 --> 16:21.564
- in the Ziegfeld Girl.
- Nathan, I got a mimosa
for you, buddy.

16:21.648 --> 16:23.149
- No!
- Try it-- okay.

16:25.735 --> 16:27.570
Nora Antony.

16:31.825 --> 16:32.826
Boo!

16:32.909 --> 16:34.536
Hey...

16:34.619 --> 16:36.079
You're back! Oh, my God!

16:36.162 --> 16:38.164
- Yep.
- I really missed you, man.

16:38.248 --> 16:40.625
It's been 24-7 History Channel
without you.

16:40.709 --> 16:43.253
Hey, how was it down there?
Was it scary?

16:43.336 --> 16:44.713
Did you eat the slop?

16:44.796 --> 16:46.256
I told Mildred you were probably
eating the slop.

16:46.339 --> 16:48.550
I was literally frozen
the entire time.

16:48.633 --> 16:49.801
Uh, I-I got to go.

16:49.884 --> 16:51.970
I got to make a call, okay?

16:53.263 --> 16:55.473
I shouldn't have
brought up the slop.

17:06.568 --> 17:08.361
Schvitz Bath.

17:08.445 --> 17:11.030
Yeah, no one's looking
for me in here.

17:12.574 --> 17:14.367
For God sakes!

17:14.451 --> 17:17.120
I've been trapped
in there since the update!

17:17.203 --> 17:18.496
I'm so hungry!

17:18.580 --> 17:20.790
Uh, somebody, uh...

17:20.874 --> 17:22.959
bring me a tongue sandwich

17:23.042 --> 17:24.961
and some rice pudding!

17:51.070 --> 17:53.448
Nora, where are you?

18:00.747 --> 18:03.333
- Nora, let's go.
- Huh? Wait, really?

18:03.416 --> 18:05.752
- I got to get
to Falafel Halal.
- I want to keep playing!

18:05.835 --> 18:07.670
Girl, those chickpea balls
are not gonna fry themselves.

18:07.754 --> 18:08.838
- That's cute.
- Okay.

18:17.972 --> 18:20.767
Shit.

18:20.850 --> 18:22.852
Sorry, Nora.

18:36.115 --> 18:37.742
Okay.

18:37.826 --> 18:40.036
I used to have
a gym membership, too.

18:40.119 --> 18:41.913
Dick.

18:41.996 --> 18:44.833
Maybe just edit this down

18:44.916 --> 18:47.126
to a quarter star.

18:47.210 --> 18:48.878
That's better.

19:04.310 --> 19:06.062
Hey, Bladerunner?

19:06.145 --> 19:07.689
Caught any killer toasters
lately?

19:07.772 --> 19:10.358
Ha ha. Look at this case.

19:10.441 --> 19:11.985
Guy minding his own business,

19:12.068 --> 19:14.821
next thing you know he gets
pulped in a smart elevator.

19:14.904 --> 19:16.865
Everything's got AI now.

19:16.948 --> 19:19.409
Piss off your toaster,
it could blow up your car.

19:19.492 --> 19:22.328
Accident? Hmm.

19:22.412 --> 19:25.582
Maybe, maybe not.

19:33.756 --> 19:35.383
Morning, temp.
How do you pronounce your name?

19:35.466 --> 19:36.885
- Uh, Tinsley.
- Mm-hmm.

19:36.968 --> 19:38.553
Yeah, I-I really need this job.

19:38.636 --> 19:41.097
But I don't have any experience.

19:41.180 --> 19:43.224
Okay, so basically you lied
on your résumé.

19:43.308 --> 19:45.018
No, no, no, I wouldn't do...

19:45.101 --> 19:46.603
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

19:46.686 --> 19:48.438
I did the same thing
when I first started.

19:48.521 --> 19:49.981
We gonna get along just fine.

19:50.064 --> 19:52.233
I'm so excited! That's cool.

19:52.317 --> 19:53.902
- Your jacket can go
in a locker.
- Okay.

19:53.985 --> 19:55.820
And leave it there,
'cause I don't like it.

19:55.904 --> 19:57.614
- The j--? This jacket?
- Mm-hmm.

19:57.697 --> 19:59.324
- Oh, okay.
- I hate it.

19:59.407 --> 20:01.451
I just, I've had this
for a really long time.

20:01.534 --> 20:03.119
I know, but you got a job now.
Buy a new one.

20:03.202 --> 20:05.622
Well, yeah, yeah.
I don't need it. It's fine.

20:05.705 --> 20:07.040
But stand up for yourself.

20:07.123 --> 20:09.167
Okay, so I--?
So the jacket--?

20:09.250 --> 20:11.127
- No jacket?
- My God,
just forget it.

20:11.210 --> 20:14.130
Okay, well, um... thank you.

20:15.882 --> 20:17.467
- Oh, my God.

20:17.550 --> 20:19.052
What?

20:19.135 --> 20:21.346
The motherlode, I can feel it.

20:22.430 --> 20:24.682
- Here, let me help you.
- No way! I called it.

20:24.766 --> 20:26.517
What do you mean you called--?
You can't call it.

20:26.601 --> 20:28.436
What is it, second grade?

20:28.519 --> 20:30.355
- Get out of here!
- It's mine!

20:30.438 --> 20:32.315
No, it's not, it's ours.

20:40.406 --> 20:42.158
Am I alone here?

20:43.368 --> 20:44.786
In feeling something?

20:44.869 --> 20:46.496
No.

20:47.789 --> 20:49.165
I don't know.

20:49.248 --> 20:52.669
Uh... there's just...

20:52.752 --> 20:55.463
kind of somebody back home.

20:55.546 --> 20:57.548
At least I think there is.

20:57.632 --> 21:00.510
You seem less
than sure about it.

21:02.136 --> 21:04.097
Well, when you do feel sure,

21:04.180 --> 21:06.557
I'll be here.

21:07.934 --> 21:09.352
In the garden.

21:09.435 --> 21:13.481
You know, digging up
giant potatoes.

21:16.067 --> 21:18.653
Thanks.

21:24.117 --> 21:26.494
It's still crooked.

21:28.329 --> 21:31.124
Wow. More Ingrids.

21:31.207 --> 21:32.583
You like it?

21:32.667 --> 21:34.377
What's not to like?

21:34.460 --> 21:36.963
And where have you been?

21:37.046 --> 21:39.090
Oh, the gym.

21:39.173 --> 21:42.260
Oh, Nathan's like a pro athlete
since he defrosted.

21:42.343 --> 21:44.721
He works out hours a day.

21:44.804 --> 21:47.557
Wow, why doesn't he just become
best friends with the gym?

21:47.640 --> 21:49.142
Oh, wait, he can't.

21:49.225 --> 21:51.519
Because he doesn't care
about anyone.

21:51.602 --> 21:54.105
I was gonna head
back there again actually.

21:54.188 --> 21:56.024
- Hey, you just got here.
- Babe, you just got here.

21:56.107 --> 21:57.984
I forgot the calves, so...

21:58.067 --> 21:59.318
You know what,
they do look pretty shrimpy.

21:59.402 --> 22:00.528
Pathetic, really.

22:00.611 --> 22:01.487
Do you want to come?

22:01.571 --> 22:04.115
Yes! I can-- Yes!

22:04.198 --> 22:05.908
Absolutely.

22:07.118 --> 22:08.703
Hup!

22:08.786 --> 22:11.039
- Baby-- Oh, my God!
- Look alive! Look alive!

22:15.710 --> 22:19.172
Okay, looks like it's just us,
Grandmama.

22:19.255 --> 22:21.257
I know, I know, okay? I'm sorry.

22:21.340 --> 22:24.260
- I've been a shitty friend.
- Oh, you think?

22:24.343 --> 22:26.054
Got something to show you.

22:26.137 --> 22:27.430
You do?

22:29.974 --> 22:32.018
This is just sad.

22:32.101 --> 22:34.103
Oh, okay, just listen to me.

22:34.187 --> 22:36.189
A lot happened
while I was in 2Gig, okay?

22:36.272 --> 22:37.482
I was on the phone with Nora,
trying to apologize.

22:37.565 --> 22:39.025
Someone broke
into her apartment.

22:39.108 --> 22:40.985
- Oh, my God!
- Tried to stab her.

22:41.069 --> 22:43.071
- Oh, no!
- I know, I had to take him out.

22:43.154 --> 22:45.573
I'm sorry, what?

22:45.656 --> 22:47.492
I mean, it was self-defense.

22:47.575 --> 22:49.744
But still, don't tell anybody.

22:49.827 --> 22:51.913
Of-of course not!

22:51.996 --> 22:53.372
My God!

22:53.456 --> 22:54.791
I just,
I have so many questions.

22:54.874 --> 22:56.459
Yeah, so do I.

22:56.542 --> 22:57.919
Who's this guy?

22:59.128 --> 23:01.380
Oh...

23:01.464 --> 23:03.299
Just some guy
she met on Nitely.

23:03.382 --> 23:05.843
Okay, now I worry.

23:07.095 --> 23:08.429
It's been a month.

23:08.513 --> 23:10.098
No clues.
What if they found her?

23:10.181 --> 23:12.517
Or she moved on.

23:12.600 --> 23:16.229
Hey, who am I kidding, like she
could just move on from you.

23:19.649 --> 23:21.692
So how are things with Ingrid?

23:21.776 --> 23:24.654
- Mm. Ingrid, yeah.
- She's hot.

23:26.447 --> 23:27.824
She uploaded for me.

23:27.907 --> 23:29.534
Fuck, man.

23:29.617 --> 23:31.869
It's like every girl
who likes you winds up dead.

23:34.038 --> 23:35.373
Well, it's lunch in ten minutes.

23:35.456 --> 23:37.041
I'm gonna go freshen up.

23:48.845 --> 23:50.805
Uh, hey, you know what, I'm
actually gonna check something.

23:50.888 --> 23:52.849
- Uh, one sec.
- Oh.

24:04.652 --> 24:07.071
Choose
your avatar.

24:18.207 --> 24:20.209
- Hi.
- Hi.

24:22.044 --> 24:23.838
Can we talk?

24:25.798 --> 24:27.091
Yeah.

24:35.183 --> 24:37.977
I probably freaked you out.

24:38.060 --> 24:40.021
By showing up here.

24:41.772 --> 24:43.316
It was...

24:43.399 --> 24:45.484
I guess, impulsive.

24:45.568 --> 24:48.279
And maybe a little controlling.

24:48.362 --> 24:50.823
And I'm sorry.

24:52.867 --> 24:55.244
Before I got here,

24:55.328 --> 24:58.664
did you... meet anyone?

24:58.748 --> 25:02.043
Did you fall in love
with another upload?

25:03.628 --> 25:05.296
Kind of.

25:07.882 --> 25:09.926
I had feelings for someone.

25:10.009 --> 25:11.510
But...

25:11.594 --> 25:13.387
it's over.

25:13.471 --> 25:15.932
Ow.

25:16.015 --> 25:17.934
Please, please don't scream.

25:18.017 --> 25:20.394
I'm not gonna scream,
I'm not gonna scream.

25:24.941 --> 25:27.193
I mean, I figured as much.

25:28.986 --> 25:30.738
You're great.

25:32.073 --> 25:34.659
A lot of people are
gonna love you.

25:36.494 --> 25:39.080
Just not as much as me.

25:40.831 --> 25:43.584
- You uploaded for me.
- Yeah, I did.

25:43.668 --> 25:45.711
I know that you changed
since coming here,

25:45.795 --> 25:48.422
but I can, too.

25:48.506 --> 25:50.508
You'll see.

25:52.051 --> 25:54.136
I'm gonna earn your love back.

25:54.220 --> 25:56.222
Okay?

25:58.182 --> 25:59.976
I'm here now.

26:00.059 --> 26:02.478
And I'm here to love you,
I'm not the bad guy.

26:05.189 --> 26:07.024
And neither are you.

27:08.002 --> 27:10.004
Nora Antony.

27:17.720 --> 27:19.722
Want a drink?

27:26.812 --> 27:29.065
Hey, it's...

27:29.148 --> 27:31.150
it's me again, um...

27:33.778 --> 27:36.405
God, I really don't want
to say this on the phone.

27:38.282 --> 27:41.410
I've wanted so badly to say it
back to you that day, Nora.

27:43.079 --> 27:45.414
I love you, too.

27:45.498 --> 27:47.249
You're smart.

27:47.333 --> 27:49.418
You're funny.

27:49.502 --> 27:51.587
You're beautiful, you...

27:51.670 --> 27:54.048
you always see
the best in people.

27:54.131 --> 27:56.759
I didn't deserve
someone like that.

27:56.842 --> 27:59.011
Still don't.

28:02.473 --> 28:05.017
Now I need to accept that...

28:05.101 --> 28:07.728
you don't want to talk
to me anymore.

28:11.315 --> 28:13.901
I'm sorry for getting you
into this mess.

28:15.361 --> 28:17.405
Wherever you are,

28:17.488 --> 28:19.281
I hope you're safe.

28:23.244 --> 28:25.538
Goodbye, Angel.

28:30.209 --> 28:32.211
Phantom ping.

28:33.295 --> 28:35.089
I haven't had
one of those in ages.
