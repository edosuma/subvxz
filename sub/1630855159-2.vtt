01:23.292 --> 01:24.293
<i>Sam?</i>

01:27.629 --> 01:28.630
Sam!

01:29.214 --> 01:32.259
Bye, Pops. See you in 2003.

01:34.261 --> 01:36.138
Happy New Year, Mr. Yeung.

01:40.434 --> 01:41.602
Jesus.

01:41.602 --> 01:43.270
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:44.897 --> 01:46.523
It appears your dad hates me?

01:46.523 --> 01:48.358
No. It's not you he hates,

01:48.358 --> 01:49.443
it's just New Year's Eve.

01:50.068 --> 01:52.362
Matched only
by his hatred for the Fourth of July.

01:52.362 --> 01:53.822
Okay.

01:54.948 --> 01:56.909
Wait, I thought you said
he made fireworks though.

01:56.909 --> 01:59.536
Isn't that like--
It's like an accountant hating tax season.

01:59.536 --> 02:01.288
Well, he wasn't always this way.

02:01.288 --> 02:03.665
The Italians get all the big jobs
in the city,

02:03.665 --> 02:05.792
and he used to do okay
with the smaller gigs.

02:05.792 --> 02:08.002
But now everyone's trying to cut corners.

02:08.002 --> 02:09.378
That sucks. That's like--

02:09.880 --> 02:12.549
It's like if you fired Santa Claus
because you found someone who

02:12.549 --> 02:15.802
could deliver the same amount of presents
using, like, half the reindeer.

02:17.179 --> 02:19.348
Yes. Yes. Yeah, totally.

02:20.641 --> 02:23.769
I mean, if Santa was
a bitter alcoholic with high cholesterol.

02:24.269 --> 02:26.396
But you got to admit,
it's kind of surprising that he's not.

02:27.856 --> 02:30.400
I think
my dad secretly wanted to get fired.

02:31.401 --> 02:34.780
Like, he always blames himself
for my mom leaving

02:34.780 --> 02:37.199
and now the world can't punish him enough,
you know?

02:38.825 --> 02:39.826
Yeah.

02:40.911 --> 02:42.913
Yeah,
I worry about that happening to my mom.

02:43.664 --> 02:48.126
Like-- Like if you take away her grief,
what's left?

02:49.419 --> 02:51.880
Besides her worrying about me. You know?

02:52.548 --> 02:55.008
Well, she doesn't have to worry about you
because you're in good hands.

02:59.555 --> 03:01.682
- We can watch the fireworks from the roof.
- All right.

03:01.682 --> 03:05.894
- With a couple enhancements, of course.
- What do you mean by "enhancements"?

03:05.894 --> 03:09.773
I don't know about you, Charles, but
I have had just about enough of reality.

03:11.066 --> 03:14.236
Okay, no. That's exactly
what my mom would worry about though.

03:14.236 --> 03:17.155
Okay. Well,
you don't have to tell her everything.

03:17.155 --> 03:18.949
Besides, you've shroomed before, right?

03:20.075 --> 03:21.201
Yeah, of course.

03:22.286 --> 03:26.540
Oh, my God. Charles,
you never have to lie to me. Okay?

03:27.124 --> 03:29.001
I'm never gonna judge you.

03:29.001 --> 03:33.547
In a world full of bullshit, where people
are going to love you and leave you,

03:33.547 --> 03:36.508
you and I will be the one true thing
in each other's life.

03:39.094 --> 03:40.095
Okay?

03:42.556 --> 03:43.599
Yeah, okay.

03:44.349 --> 03:45.184
Okay.

03:47.769 --> 03:48.770
Let's go.

03:50.480 --> 03:53.358
Here we go!

03:58.488 --> 04:00.115
2003!

04:00.616 --> 04:02.242
Happy New Year!

04:06.997 --> 04:08.248
Holy shit!

04:09.625 --> 04:10.626
I know, right?

04:13.420 --> 04:14.713
You do know?

04:14.713 --> 04:16.632
- I do know.
- Yeah, you do.

04:25.432 --> 04:26.433
Charles...

04:30.395 --> 04:31.897
I have to tell you something.

04:33.232 --> 04:34.233
Anything.

04:42.241 --> 04:43.784
I need water.

04:45.619 --> 04:46.620
Yeah, water.

04:47.204 --> 04:49.456
Let's-- I'll get you some--
Water's a great idea.

04:49.456 --> 04:51.416
Let's get you some water. It's--

04:53.752 --> 04:55.838
I'm gonna--
I'll be right back, okay? Stay here.

05:22.781 --> 05:23.699
Sam?

05:26.034 --> 05:28.495
- What the fuck?
- Hi. Hi, Sol.

05:30.747 --> 05:32.082
What the fuck did you do to her?

05:32.082 --> 05:34.960
- What, me? Me? No, no, no, no. I didn't--
- No, no, no. No.

05:34.960 --> 05:37.546
- Charles is a friend.
- What's in her system?

05:39.631 --> 05:43.844
Pizza, hot chocolate,
whatever was in her flask and then--

05:45.387 --> 05:47.556
Yeah, some mushroo--
Well, a lot of mushrooms. I mean,

05:47.556 --> 05:50.100
- she probably took twice as much as me.
- Okay. Hey, hey.

05:51.310 --> 05:52.728
Just keep her alert, okay?

05:52.728 --> 05:54.396
There's a shower downstairs.
Throw her in it.

05:54.396 --> 05:56.273
Okay, sure.

05:56.273 --> 05:58.567
- Now!
- Yeah. Ready?

05:58.567 --> 06:00.068
Happy New Year, Sol.

06:14.666 --> 06:16.585
All right, all right, all right. Yo, yo.

06:18.795 --> 06:19.922
It's almost midnight.

06:21.215 --> 06:23.717
Yo, I said it's almost midnight!

06:26.261 --> 06:28.555
You know, I just wanted
to thank everyone for coming.

06:29.431 --> 06:33.143
It's important for people
to gather to celebrate.

06:33.143 --> 06:34.061
That's right.

06:34.061 --> 06:37.940
You know, this is how
we create ritual. Form community.

06:39.483 --> 06:41.485
Fuck, this is how we start a revolution.

06:44.530 --> 06:45.364
There you go.

06:45.364 --> 06:49.034
We are neighbors, friends,
artistic collaborators...

06:49.034 --> 06:50.160
- Okay--
- Okay.

06:51.828 --> 06:57.668
This bathroom is definitely unpermitted,
but big guy said to cool you down.

06:57.668 --> 06:59.920
- So let's get you in there, right.
- Okay, I need to sit down.

06:59.920 --> 07:01.463
- What? What, here?
- I need to sit down.

07:01.463 --> 07:03.215
Okay. Sorry.

07:04.925 --> 07:07.845
If you're in this city,
it's 'cause you want to make shit.

07:09.930 --> 07:12.724
'Cause you wanna do shit.

07:14.226 --> 07:16.270
You wanna be the shit!

07:19.064 --> 07:20.607
- Charles.
- Don't worry. I got it, I got it.

07:20.607 --> 07:22.568
Yeah, I got it. Don't worry about it.

07:28.282 --> 07:30.450
- Sam, I got it.
- Okay, thank you.

07:31.118 --> 07:31.952
Here.

07:31.952 --> 07:34.413
You have to go from the top.
They're leather.

07:34.413 --> 07:36.331
- What?
- You need to pull from higher.

07:37.958 --> 07:39.376
- Like, here?
- Yeah.

07:39.376 --> 07:41.920
Okay. Well, I-- I can-- Sorry.

07:41.920 --> 07:43.714
- Can you just grab on?
- Sorry. I got it.

07:43.714 --> 07:45.549
You're closing your eyes?

07:46.717 --> 07:48.760
Look at me. Look at me, Charles.

07:49.928 --> 07:51.638
- Okay, just pull.
- What?

07:51.638 --> 07:54.141
I just want to make sure you're comf--
like, good.

07:55.184 --> 07:56.226
Okay, yeah, just--

08:00.022 --> 08:00.939
Okay.

08:02.274 --> 08:04.067
Okay.

08:10.073 --> 08:14.328
This town needs us.
Just as much as we need it.

08:14.828 --> 08:15.829
Tell 'em.

08:15.829 --> 08:19.291
Now, if you can see it,
you can be it, motherfuckers.

08:21.960 --> 08:27.633
Now, let 2003 be the year
that we take back what's ours.

08:28.926 --> 08:32.596
Let's burn this city to the ground.

08:35.765 --> 08:39.269
Charles, I can't undo my top.

08:40.270 --> 08:42.481
- Is-- Is that me?
- Can you-- Yeah.

08:42.481 --> 08:43.565
Okay.

08:52.908 --> 08:54.117
Right here. Yeah.

08:54.993 --> 08:56.203
I just--

09:04.628 --> 09:06.171
Okay, I got it.

09:06.171 --> 09:07.464
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

09:13.720 --> 09:14.721
Ten!

09:15.973 --> 09:17.558
Nine!

09:20.978 --> 09:24.690
Five! Four!

09:25.399 --> 09:28.694
- Charles, where are you?
- I'm here. Are you okay?

09:28.694 --> 09:29.987
One!

09:30.737 --> 09:33.407
Happy New Year!

09:55.846 --> 09:57.431
I told you I would take care of you,

09:57.431 --> 10:00.058
but it looks like
you're kind of the one taking care of me.

10:05.397 --> 10:06.982
Never really had that before.

10:09.401 --> 10:10.402
It's nice.

10:17.034 --> 10:18.660
You're really nice, Charlie.

10:37.638 --> 10:39.181
I like-- I like taking care of you.

10:44.770 --> 10:45.771
Sam?

10:46.688 --> 10:48.899
Sam, you said I could tell you anything.

11:03.205 --> 11:05.415
I think I need to tell you
that I love you.

11:48.584 --> 11:50.294
Don't just stand there. We gotta hurry.

12:11.648 --> 12:13.233
One, two and--

13:00.739 --> 13:02.741
<i>Dave, it's Regan.</i>

13:04.743 --> 13:07.663
<i>If you could call me back
as soon as you get this message,</i>

13:08.830 --> 13:10.165
<i>it's about my father.</i>

13:11.583 --> 13:13.001
<i>It's time sensitive.</i>

13:13.877 --> 13:16.547
<i>Please record your message.
When you have finished recording,</i>

13:16.547 --> 13:19.591
<i>you may hang up
or press one for more options.</i>

13:20.092 --> 13:20.926
Alan,

13:20.926 --> 13:25.556
I really hope this is still your number
and I would say, I'm sorry to bother you.

13:25.556 --> 13:27.474
Except I'm clearly not bothering you

13:27.474 --> 13:34.064
since you, like the nine other members
of our legal so-called team,

13:34.064 --> 13:35.941
are not answering the phone.

13:37.067 --> 13:40.445
Call me back or tell someone else to.

13:41.154 --> 13:43.031
I need help.

14:18.150 --> 14:20.277
I don't-- I don't know how to--
how to do this

14:20.861 --> 14:24.907
or how it works or if it works, but--

14:30.829 --> 14:34.041
I-- I know I can't lose her.

14:48.222 --> 14:51.266
So-- So, please, God, hear me pray.

15:08.242 --> 15:11.286
Like to
give everyone a little alone time in here

15:11.286 --> 15:17.084
to see what happens.
Guilty ones tend to fall asleep.

15:17.668 --> 15:18.752
No chance with that.

15:19.503 --> 15:22.756
I'm innocent
and wired on adrenaline and anxiety.

15:23.507 --> 15:26.593
Love it when a suspect tells
me they're innocent right off the bat.

15:26.593 --> 15:28.428
It feels so believable.

15:28.428 --> 15:31.890
Suspect? I thought I was a witness.

15:31.890 --> 15:33.308
So, Mr. Goodman,

15:34.476 --> 15:36.436
how'd it happen that we found you
covered in blood,

15:36.436 --> 15:37.604
bag of dope in your pocket,

15:37.604 --> 15:39.606
standing over a girl
with a hole in her head?

15:39.606 --> 15:40.858
When you put it that way...

15:42.818 --> 15:44.862
Before we start, I have to ask--

15:44.862 --> 15:46.905
- Sure, do you want a lawyer?
- Not about me.

15:48.282 --> 15:51.493
The girl. She-- She going to live?

15:54.121 --> 15:56.582
I'm not sure. Doesn't sound great.

15:57.374 --> 16:02.713
If you're a religious man, which I am not,
I'd say now is the time to pray.

16:05.757 --> 16:06.758
Okay--

16:24.735 --> 16:25.736
Mr. Yeung.

16:28.113 --> 16:30.657
Detective McFadden,
Manhattan North Homicide.

16:30.657 --> 16:32.826
I'm one of the detectives
working your daughter's case.

16:32.826 --> 16:35.287
Homicide? But-- But she isn't dead.

16:36.914 --> 16:37.915
No.

16:40.042 --> 16:42.669
But, you know, if anything changes,

16:42.669 --> 16:44.796
we just want to make sure
we didn't miss something.

16:47.257 --> 16:50.427
You know, you get a much better class
of detective this way.

16:51.136 --> 16:54.765
And believe me, you don't want this
handled by the jokers in violent crime.

16:58.393 --> 17:01.355
Now, I know this is a difficult time,

17:01.355 --> 17:03.273
but do you mind
if I ask you a few questions?

17:09.029 --> 17:10.781
Half a gram of heroin in that jacket.

17:11.281 --> 17:13.325
I'm assuming you were buying, not selling?

17:13.325 --> 17:15.035
What? No, neither.

17:15.035 --> 17:19.289
Like I said, it wasn't my suit,
and I've never done drugs.

17:20.290 --> 17:21.124
Never?

17:22.835 --> 17:28.173
Okay. Well, I have smoked pot.
Tonight, actually.

17:28.173 --> 17:30.342
- Wait, so you were high in the park?
- My goodness.

17:30.342 --> 17:36.056
No. I barely even inhaled.
I just wanted to seem like I was fun.

17:37.140 --> 17:39.810
I was at a party,
hosted by the Hamilton-Sweeneys.

17:39.810 --> 17:41.311
Maybe you've heard of them.

17:41.311 --> 17:42.521
Doesn't ring a bell.

17:43.230 --> 17:47.484
My roommate, William,
his father was the host,

17:48.652 --> 17:49.903
though he wasn't there.

17:50.571 --> 17:53.407
Neither was William.
He's estranged from them now.

17:56.034 --> 18:00.205
I didn't have a suit nice enough
to wear to a party like that.

18:01.623 --> 18:04.042
Summer whites, the invitation said.

18:05.669 --> 18:07.588
So I-- I borrowed William's.

18:08.088 --> 18:10.174
So his jacket, his heroin.

18:12.092 --> 18:13.302
Were you aware of his habit?

18:13.302 --> 18:14.928
He told me it was in the past.

18:16.722 --> 18:19.266
Foolishly, I believed him.

18:20.225 --> 18:23.896
Addicts have that way about them.
They lie as easy as they breathe.

18:24.479 --> 18:25.898
But I am not a liar.

18:26.940 --> 18:30.944
It is like I told you,
I was waiting for the bus.

18:30.944 --> 18:34.615
She was waiting for something
or someone else.

18:34.615 --> 18:36.825
When I got back, she was gone.

18:37.492 --> 18:42.372
When I followed that sound into the park,

18:43.165 --> 18:46.627
I-- I found her, and I called you.

18:54.009 --> 18:55.010
Okay.

18:56.678 --> 19:00.140
Let's say you're just a Good Samaritan
with lousy timing.

19:02.392 --> 19:04.436
It doesn't mean
you're off the hook just yet.

19:05.938 --> 19:09.942
You've been dusted for gunpowder residue
and obliged us a set of fingerprints.

19:10.734 --> 19:13.195
I'm also gonna need your phone number
and your address.

19:13.862 --> 19:17.366
Do not lie. I will be checking.

19:17.991 --> 19:20.994
And you don't leave the city.
Till this case is solved,

19:20.994 --> 19:23.038
you will continue to be
a person of interest

19:23.038 --> 19:24.289
in an attempted murder.

19:24.289 --> 19:26.792
Thank you, Detective Parsa.

19:31.964 --> 19:34.132
And I hope you find who did it.

19:35.050 --> 19:36.385
I only spoke to her briefly,

19:36.385 --> 19:39.680
but she seemed like
a girl with so much to live for.

19:47.980 --> 19:51.483
Son, wake up. Well, good morning.

19:58.574 --> 19:59.616
Jesus Christ.

20:01.159 --> 20:04.413
Sorry. I shouldn't be here.
I don't belong here. I'm sorry.

20:04.413 --> 20:07.374
This is God's house.
Everyone belongs here.

20:08.000 --> 20:09.126
We don't even lock the door.

20:09.126 --> 20:10.210
Well, I'm Jewish.

20:11.587 --> 20:12.588
I'm adopted, but--

20:13.338 --> 20:16.633
Well, the first thing I said
when my parents told me was,

20:16.633 --> 20:19.553
"So, I'm not chosen?"
And they said, "You are, Charlie, by us."

20:19.553 --> 20:20.512
And, you know,

20:20.512 --> 20:23.390
no offense to the Weisbargers
of Flower Hill, Long Island,

20:23.390 --> 20:26.435
but, like, biblically speaking,
that's not really the same thing.

20:27.436 --> 20:28.729
What's brought you here, son?

20:37.196 --> 20:41.200
Something terrible happened,
and I don't really know what to do.

20:43.869 --> 20:47.414
I wanna know if she's okay,
but part of me wants to not know

20:47.414 --> 20:50.542
and wants to keep not knowing,
because if she's not, then I--

20:52.461 --> 20:53.921
I don't really know what I'll do.

20:54.630 --> 20:56.965
Like, if she--

20:59.843 --> 21:03.263
If she does not survive,
then I will not survive.

21:03.263 --> 21:06.099
Does that-- Does that make any sense?

21:12.814 --> 21:14.858
I'm sorry. It's too much to explain.

21:26.119 --> 21:28.956
Cate, can you turn that down?

21:28.956 --> 21:31.625
It's really loud.
It's giving me a headache.

21:31.625 --> 21:33.043
Or you're really hungover.

21:35.087 --> 21:36.880
How do you even know what that is?

21:36.880 --> 21:38.006
So, you admit it?

21:39.800 --> 21:40.884
I admit nothing.

21:45.472 --> 21:46.849
<i>Sorry for the wait, Regan.</i>

21:46.849 --> 21:49.393
<i>Your father is sleeping,
and I really don't want to disturb him.</i>

21:49.393 --> 21:51.395
- <i>We've got the flight ahead of us.</i>
- Okay,

21:51.395 --> 21:53.230
but that's why I'm calling.

21:53.897 --> 21:56.817
Did Amory or Felicia speak with him?

21:56.817 --> 22:00.153
Because there are some things
he needs to know before he lands.

22:00.153 --> 22:03.448
They haven't. And the doctors
warned against unnecessary stress.

22:03.448 --> 22:07.160
Okay, but unfortunately,
this stress is necessary,

22:07.160 --> 22:10.789
and the more time he has to process it,
the better. So, if you could just wake him

22:10.789 --> 22:13.250
and put him on the phone,
I'd really appreciate that.

22:13.250 --> 22:16.920
I'm sorry, Regan. I'm not gonna do that.
You can talk to him when he's home.

22:20.757 --> 22:23.886
He hung up on me.
The fucker hung up on me.

22:27.347 --> 22:29.349
Redirect those eyeballs somewhere else.

22:30.434 --> 22:31.935
I thought you were talking to me.

22:35.355 --> 22:38.066
- Who else were you talking to?
- Hold on, Will. Hold on.

22:39.818 --> 22:43.030
Hey. Yes. Sorry, I-- I couldn't--

22:43.030 --> 22:45.574
I didn't make it to the party last night.
Something came up.

22:45.574 --> 22:48.243
No need for an explanation.
You're a coward, I get it.

22:48.243 --> 22:51.079
<i>And I wish I had literally anyone else
in the world to call.</i>

22:51.079 --> 22:53.582
But when my father gets back from
the Mayo Clinic today,

22:53.582 --> 22:56.710
he's going to be taken directly
to the judge's chamber to be arraigned.

22:57.336 --> 22:58.337
What?

22:58.879 --> 23:00.964
- What's the charge?
- <i>Wire fraud.</i>

23:02.257 --> 23:05.302
What-- That's a--
That's a federal offense.

23:05.302 --> 23:08.096
Yeah. Apparently,
it can get you 20 years in prison.

23:08.597 --> 23:11.892
Not to mention we have loans coming due
on the 5th Avenue buildings.

23:12.768 --> 23:16.104
So, if the banks won't do business
with us, well, we could lose everything.

23:16.104 --> 23:18.815
<i>Regan, your father would
never do anything dishonest.</i>

23:18.815 --> 23:21.318
Well, obviously-- Not on purpose, like--

23:22.444 --> 23:24.196
You know how diligent I've been, but if--

23:24.196 --> 23:26.949
I can't look at every document
that has his signature on it.

23:26.949 --> 23:29.409
<i>I'm not even sure if
he knows anything about it,</i>

23:29.409 --> 23:31.411
<i>or if he's gonna be totally blindsided.</i>

23:33.288 --> 23:34.331
What does Amory think?

23:34.331 --> 23:36.375
<i>I wish I knew. I can't get a hold of him.</i>

23:36.375 --> 23:40.420
I got a message through a lawyer that said
everything had been taken care of

23:40.420 --> 23:43.674
and I should just stay home,
and I-- I can't do that.

23:43.674 --> 23:49.930
So-- Anyway, I know it's not your day,
but if you could-- The kids could just--

23:49.930 --> 23:52.975
Oh, my God. Yeah, of course I'll take 'em.
It's the least I could do.

23:52.975 --> 23:54.518
Well, yeah. No shit.

23:55.435 --> 23:58.188
Gotta say, they're not exactly
getting me at my best.

23:59.273 --> 24:01.024
Can't be worse than I am right now.

24:02.150 --> 24:05.404
I've never known you to be anything
other than an elegant drunk.

24:10.701 --> 24:12.411
Just get here as soon as you can, okay?

24:13.412 --> 24:14.538
Yeah, yeah.

24:17.666 --> 24:18.667
Fuck.

24:20.878 --> 24:22.421
- Parsa.
- <i>McFadden.</i>

24:22.421 --> 24:24.047
Detective, what's the latest?

24:24.047 --> 24:26.633
One thing you should know about me,
I fucking hate hospitals.

24:26.633 --> 24:28.969
Yeah, yeah. Who doesn't? How's the girl?

24:28.969 --> 24:30.137
<i>Alive.</i>

24:30.137 --> 24:31.763
- And the father?
- A wreck.

24:31.763 --> 24:33.473
Samantha's his whole life.

24:33.473 --> 24:36.810
Wife left when Sam was 11, moved
to California with a yoga instructor.

24:36.810 --> 24:39.146
Never heard from her again. Brutal.

24:39.646 --> 24:41.857
<i>Did he have any thoughts
on what she was doing in the park?</i>

24:41.857 --> 24:44.568
No. Samantha was a good student.

24:44.568 --> 24:47.446
Got into NYU on scholarship,
but she's got a big life in the city,

24:47.446 --> 24:49.406
<i>and her father has his own problems.</i>

24:49.907 --> 24:53.327
<i>Apparently, he makes fireworks,
but business isn't so good.</i>

24:53.327 --> 24:54.411
Fireworks, huh?

24:54.411 --> 24:58.582
Sam's a photographer, a writer,
into new music in downtown clubs.

25:00.584 --> 25:03.629
I'm getting dropped at
8th and University Place.

25:03.629 --> 25:05.631
- Come meet me.
- Why?

25:05.631 --> 25:07.341
It's her dorm. Has a roommate.

25:08.133 --> 25:09.635
Yeah, okay. I'll see you there.

25:25.400 --> 25:28.654
Jesus. What the fuck?

25:31.198 --> 25:32.032
Hi.

25:32.783 --> 25:33.951
Is that blood?

25:34.910 --> 25:37.120
- Yes. This is blood.
- You okay?

25:37.120 --> 25:40.499
It's not my blood
if that's what you're asking.

25:40.499 --> 25:45.337
But if you're just wondering
in a more general sense, no, I'm not okay.

25:45.337 --> 25:46.547
Jesus, Merce.

25:46.547 --> 25:49.800
See, last night, I went to
the Hamilton-Sweeney Fourth of July gala.

25:49.800 --> 25:53.428
See, your father couldn't make it,
but I did meet the demon uncle.

25:53.971 --> 25:55.389
Totally get the nickname.

25:55.389 --> 26:00.102
But the really interesting
part of the night was later,

26:00.894 --> 26:05.649
when I had found a girl in the park
who had been shot in the head.

26:06.692 --> 26:10.988
I was then taken into custody
as a suspect in her attempted murder.

26:10.988 --> 26:14.992
Stop... You're serious?

26:17.828 --> 26:20.414
How could the cops possibly think
that you shot someone?

26:20.414 --> 26:24.835
I'd say 90% racism

26:24.835 --> 26:28.505
and 10% the half-gram of heroin
that they found

26:28.505 --> 26:32.176
- in the pocket of your lovely suit jacket...
- Okay.

26:32.176 --> 26:35.596
...which they kept
because it is now evidence.

26:35.596 --> 26:38.307
Look, I am really sorry about your night

26:39.349 --> 26:43.312
but it's not like I kept my drugs
in your jacket.

26:45.731 --> 26:48.692
Plus, I haven't worn
that fucking suit in years.

26:49.193 --> 26:54.031
You wore it for dinner
at Minetta Tavern last week!

26:54.031 --> 26:56.617
William, you told me
you would quit using heroin!

26:56.617 --> 26:59.077
It was a condition
of my moving in with you!

26:59.077 --> 27:02.039
Yeah. Well, they don't call it
addiction for nothing?

27:07.711 --> 27:10.923
I mean, look. If you would have just
not gone to that party behind my back,

27:10.923 --> 27:12.341
then none of this would've happened.

27:12.341 --> 27:16.345
So, you're going to start
a different fight,

27:16.345 --> 27:17.804
so we don't have to finish this one?

27:17.804 --> 27:19.765
You always turn tables
when you're cornered!

27:19.765 --> 27:21.266
I don't like being cornered.

27:22.434 --> 27:23.727
I wanted you to come with me.

27:23.727 --> 27:27.606
No. Mercer, listen to me, okay?
I didn't want to go.

27:28.857 --> 27:32.110
That's my family. That's my invitation.

27:32.110 --> 27:35.239
My suit, my fucking heroin.

27:35.239 --> 27:36.323
And if-- if--

27:37.950 --> 27:40.494
if you could just stop being
so interested in me all the time--

27:40.494 --> 27:43.121
Where I go, what I'm doing,
where I come from,

27:43.121 --> 27:47.125
what I fucking inject into my veins--
We could have a beautiful life.

27:49.253 --> 27:51.839
This is-- This is exactly why
I didn't fucking say anything to you,

27:51.839 --> 27:54.007
because-- because I know
how judgmental you can be.

27:54.007 --> 27:56.385
- I'm not-- No, I'm not judging you.
- No?

27:56.385 --> 27:58.762
- William, I am growing concerned...
- Okay.

27:58.762 --> 28:00.556
...for your health, for our relationship!

28:00.556 --> 28:02.307
Our relationship. All right.

28:03.183 --> 28:08.355
Let me ask you a question.
How can you make such a big deal

28:08.355 --> 28:11.233
out of something that you didn't
even know was happening?

28:11.233 --> 28:12.317
No.

28:12.943 --> 28:15.445
That is some twisted logic.

28:17.865 --> 28:20.409
Damn, you-- you really are an artist.

28:21.410 --> 28:24.788
Yeah, well, maybe if you were
more creative, you would understand.

28:24.788 --> 28:29.626
You know what? I am feeling
a burst of creativity coming out of me.

28:29.626 --> 28:31.378
Are you seriously walking out?

28:31.378 --> 28:33.505
No, yeah, I seriously am.

28:34.131 --> 28:36.300
You're-- You're just going to stand there?
Really?

28:37.092 --> 28:38.594
What, you don't think that I can move you?

28:38.594 --> 28:39.970
- You can try...
- Seriously?

28:39.970 --> 28:41.597
...but I'm hoping that you won't.

28:43.932 --> 28:46.226
Okay. Stiff as a board, strong as a rock.
Stiff as a board, strong as--

29:07.331 --> 29:08.332
I'm sorry.

29:18.717 --> 29:20.219
I'm just so tired.

29:22.596 --> 29:23.597
I know you are.

29:27.100 --> 29:28.352
It's a sickness.

29:31.230 --> 29:32.231
I know it is.

29:44.826 --> 29:45.827
Hey.

29:51.667 --> 29:53.126
Please don't give up on me.

30:13.480 --> 30:14.356
Mommy, Mommy!

30:21.029 --> 30:22.531
Cate, honey, what is it?

30:22.531 --> 30:25.659
The blue bird we saw last night,
it's dead.

30:26.785 --> 30:29.538
Okay. Don't touch it. It's full of germs.

30:29.538 --> 30:32.749
Doubtful. It's barely starting to smell
or draw flies,

30:32.749 --> 30:34.251
so it hasn't been dead that long.

30:35.627 --> 30:39.131
Okay, avian crime scene investigator.

30:39.965 --> 30:43.427
Are you sure it's dead
and not just sleeping?

30:43.427 --> 30:45.053
Quite sure. It's been shot.

30:46.263 --> 30:47.472
Shot?

30:47.472 --> 30:51.643
Look here. A clean through-and-through
wound to its belly.

30:55.647 --> 30:57.816
Who would shoot a beautiful bird?

30:59.193 --> 31:02.863
I-- I don't know, honey,
but we should probably get rid of it.

31:02.863 --> 31:06.700
Will, can you get, like,
a box or something that we can put it in?

31:07.576 --> 31:10.287
It's just a dumb, dead bird, Mom.
It doesn't need a funeral.

31:10.287 --> 31:13.749
Yes, it does. I'm going to find a flower.

31:19.171 --> 31:21.798
Please? Anything, a newspaper--

31:22.299 --> 31:23.800
Just so I don't have to touch it.

31:30.474 --> 31:32.559
What is a parrot doing in Brooklyn?

31:33.185 --> 31:35.062
It's not a parrot.
It's a great blue turaco.

31:35.938 --> 31:38.565
Probably escaped from
the World of Birds at the Bronx Zoo.

31:41.944 --> 31:43.820
- How old are you?
- Ten.

31:45.489 --> 31:46.573
Will's 12.

31:48.200 --> 31:49.368
He used to be like you.

31:49.993 --> 31:51.537
Interested in things, you know?

31:55.541 --> 31:56.542
Thank you.

31:57.376 --> 31:59.211
- That him? Will?
- Yeah.

32:00.671 --> 32:04.550
Hey, Will. Did you know Venus
is the only planet that spins clockwise?

32:08.929 --> 32:09.930
Okay.

32:13.517 --> 32:15.769
Hey. I've missed you.

32:16.728 --> 32:18.272
What's this? A flower?

32:19.314 --> 32:21.191
- Is that for me?
- Yes.

32:22.025 --> 32:23.485
- Hey.
- Hi.

32:26.905 --> 32:28.574
What, no "thank you?"

32:29.783 --> 32:32.494
I'm-- I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
Jesus. Come-- Come on.

32:33.453 --> 32:36.331
- Will's over there.
- Hey, champ.

32:39.751 --> 32:40.711
What's with him?

32:41.378 --> 32:42.546
What is it ever?

32:43.672 --> 32:46.133
Hey. Your dad's getting in today,

32:46.133 --> 32:48.844
- so he wasn't there last night?
- No.

32:50.262 --> 32:52.222
- So, you didn't talk to him?
- Not yet.

33:00.439 --> 33:02.107
All right, guys. What are we gonna do?

33:16.455 --> 33:17.581
Jesus.

33:22.044 --> 33:23.337
Charles,

33:23.337 --> 33:26.048
- <i>where are you?</i>
- <i>I'm here.</i>

33:32.012 --> 33:34.473
Sam, wake up. Sam, come on, please.

33:41.188 --> 33:42.856
- Hey.
- Hi.

33:43.440 --> 33:46.860
Hi.
I wasn't expecting you till after lunch.

33:48.320 --> 33:49.363
Pass me the milk, please?

33:50.447 --> 33:51.573
Yeah, of course.

33:53.033 --> 33:54.576
Everything okay at Mickey's?

33:55.202 --> 33:56.411
Yeah, yeah, fine. I just--

33:57.162 --> 34:01.166
I just woke up early and got bored,
so I-- I came home.

34:02.626 --> 34:03.627
Okay.

34:07.256 --> 34:08.590
Can I take this?

35:28.837 --> 35:30.297
Know exactly where we're going?

35:31.298 --> 35:32.966
Who we need to talk to here?

35:32.966 --> 35:35.427
Hell if I know how a college dorm works.

35:35.427 --> 35:38.764
I lived at home, got my 45 credits
from Mohawk Valley and split.

35:39.556 --> 35:41.266
Guess we find someone in charge
and find her room.

35:41.266 --> 35:43.227
Yeah, all right.

35:47.189 --> 35:48.190
Thank you.

36:06.583 --> 36:09.378
- What happened?
- Who said something happened?

36:11.421 --> 36:13.507
May we come in
and ask you some questions, please?

36:15.759 --> 36:16.760
Yeah.

36:18.136 --> 36:19.930
When was the last time you saw Samantha?

36:21.598 --> 36:23.684
Two weeks, maybe?

36:25.936 --> 36:31.149
We both decided to stay
for the summer, but she comes and goes.

36:32.025 --> 36:36.488
I've got an internship at the library,
so I'm gone weekdays.

36:36.488 --> 36:39.324
She's gone most nights and weekends.

36:39.324 --> 36:41.743
Yeah? Where does she go?

36:43.328 --> 36:44.830
Not that I've ever been invited,

36:45.622 --> 36:48.876
but she goes to a lot of music shows.

36:49.543 --> 36:51.503
Her friends are in some band.

36:52.129 --> 36:54.006
Do you remember the name of the band?

36:54.006 --> 36:57.926
I've never heard of them, but it's Latin.

36:57.926 --> 37:02.806
It's-- It's like carpe diem, but not.

37:03.765 --> 37:05.350
She doesn't have much here.

37:05.350 --> 37:06.935
She started with more

37:07.436 --> 37:12.733
but it just got less and less,
and now she barely sleeps here.

37:12.733 --> 37:14.735
Well, where do you think she's sleeping?

37:14.735 --> 37:17.696
I mean, she ever mention anybody special?

37:18.280 --> 37:22.868
No, but she doesn't tell me a lot.

37:25.495 --> 37:27.873
Did Sam do something?

37:32.794 --> 37:35.005
You think there's anything
to this music angle?

37:36.423 --> 37:39.176
I mean,
it's the only angle we have. So, sure.

37:41.011 --> 37:43.514
Panda Girl asked
if Sam was guilty of something,

37:43.514 --> 37:46.433
not if she was a victim. That says
something about what she was into.

37:47.017 --> 37:51.063
Or it says something about Panda Girl.
Kind of judgy, if you ask me.

37:56.777 --> 37:57.778
Hey.

37:59.780 --> 38:01.365
Yeah, yeah. On my way.

38:04.159 --> 38:05.536
You got a wife?

38:07.204 --> 38:09.873
For now. What about you?

38:10.958 --> 38:13.418
What about me? What, do I have a wife?

38:15.003 --> 38:18.131
Yeah, no, that wasn't my wife.
That was CSU.

38:18.715 --> 38:20.175
They're ready at the crime scene.

38:25.013 --> 38:27.766
Felicia, why don't you go to the car?
I'll be just a minute.

38:27.766 --> 38:29.935
Bill lands shortly. We can't be late.

38:29.935 --> 38:32.521
I promise yours will be
the first face he sees.

38:36.900 --> 38:40.237
Sordid business in the park last night. Tragic.

38:40.237 --> 38:43.407
Apparently, she was a young girl.
What kind of animal--

38:43.407 --> 38:45.284
By the way, I was curious,

38:45.284 --> 38:48.245
did Keith Lamplighter ever show up
at the party?

38:49.621 --> 38:51.290
Yeah, I don't remember seeing him.

38:56.670 --> 38:57.963
Let me check.

39:00.007 --> 39:01.341
Yeah, looks like he didn't show.

39:02.217 --> 39:03.927
I wonder what would have kept him away.

39:05.262 --> 39:07.806
I guess he got a better offer.
Have a good one.

39:41.089 --> 39:44.927
Daddy! Daddy! Daddy!

39:47.054 --> 39:48.472
- Hi!
- Regan, honey!

39:49.097 --> 39:52.142
Listen, I don't know what--
what people have told you,

39:52.142 --> 39:53.977
but we're going to have to go
with these men.

39:53.977 --> 39:55.729
He's coming alone. You can follow.

39:55.729 --> 39:57.940
- Wait, are you fucking cuffing him?
- What's happening? I don't--

39:57.940 --> 39:59.983
What, do you think he's gonna flee?

40:00.609 --> 40:02.653
Whatever this is, I'm innocent.

40:02.653 --> 40:04.363
Yeah, I know. Of course you are,

40:04.363 --> 40:06.823
and they're-- And we're--
we're gonna have to figure this out,

40:06.823 --> 40:08.367
but it's gonna be a process.

40:08.367 --> 40:10.744
No, I mean, I'm asking.
It's a-- It's a question.

40:12.204 --> 40:16.250
Can I go with him, please?
So that I can explain everything?

40:16.250 --> 40:17.459
We can explain.

40:22.840 --> 40:24.132
We'll see you there, darling.

40:25.259 --> 40:27.135
Can you be careful with him?

40:33.600 --> 40:35.310
You knew they were gonna cuff him.

40:35.310 --> 40:37.312
We had to make some compromises.

40:37.312 --> 40:39.356
They agreed to this private arraignment

40:39.356 --> 40:41.775
so they didn't have to hold him
in the Tombs for the weekend.

40:41.775 --> 40:44.778
They cuffed him. They handcuffed
an old man. You're fucking insane!

40:44.778 --> 40:46.446
Look, I know you're upset.

41:02.838 --> 41:05.424
- How's it looking?
- No one knows better than you.

41:05.424 --> 41:08.969
Park is always tough.
Lots of traffic, trash and leaf litter.

41:09.636 --> 41:11.138
Think we got something!

41:24.193 --> 41:27.487
That's a great find,
for somebody else's case.

41:28.113 --> 41:29.323
That thing looks 20 years old,

41:29.323 --> 41:32.159
not to mention our vic
was shot with a .38, not a .45.

41:32.868 --> 41:34.203
I'm gonna go for a walk.

42:01.021 --> 42:03.440
Hey! Save the city. Fuck Bloomberg.

42:37.766 --> 42:38.684
Hello?

42:38.684 --> 42:41.019
Hey, asshole.
That's just a little too much.

42:41.520 --> 42:43.146
Don't be a little bitch.

42:44.273 --> 42:45.941
Sorry if I don't wanna die.

42:46.650 --> 42:49.611
- You're not gonna die.
- Fine. Lose a fucking hand.

42:50.112 --> 42:51.947
Stop talking and just light
that thing already. Come on.

42:52.656 --> 42:55.200
Sorry to interrupt, but you guys--

42:55.200 --> 42:57.452
What the fuck?
Who the fuck let you in here?

42:57.452 --> 42:59.288
- Charlie? What are you doing here?
- Yo, dude, drop it.

42:59.288 --> 43:00.789
Drop it now! Fuck!

43:15.804 --> 43:17.389
It fucking worked.

43:22.394 --> 43:23.604
It fucking worked!

43:24.104 --> 43:26.106
That was beautiful.

43:29.234 --> 43:33.488
- What the fuck, Nicky?
- Yo, it fucking worked. It fucking worked.

43:39.161 --> 43:40.204
Jesus.

43:42.331 --> 43:44.791
- You shouldn't have seen that.
- Hey, Sol, don't.

43:44.791 --> 43:46.293
I can explain. I came--

43:48.128 --> 43:50.422
<i>Let me guess. You caught a new case.</i>

43:50.422 --> 43:53.258
Yeah. Attempted murder.
Teenage girl in the park.

43:53.258 --> 43:55.552
Some son of a bitch
put one right in her skull.

43:55.552 --> 43:57.137
<i>Oh, my God. What's wrong with people?</i>

43:57.137 --> 43:58.472
Hey, I gotta go.

44:22.287 --> 44:25.791
Fuck. Fucking stinks.

44:39.930 --> 44:41.557
Hey, you got something?

44:46.395 --> 44:47.938
Does this look like Latin to you?

44:50.399 --> 44:51.692
Carpe fucking diem.
