00:07.500 --> 00:09.840
Sloan. What are you
doing home?

00:09.880 --> 00:12.220
I'm not pipping off from
school. I'm genuinely sick.

00:12.260 --> 00:13.510
Ah, no. You're not.

00:13.550 --> 00:16.140
How do you know? I mean,
how can you be so sure?

00:16.180 --> 00:17.600
I just am sure,

00:17.640 --> 00:19.270
Okay? And I'm not in the
mood to be lied to.

00:19.310 --> 00:21.350
Jake. I'm not lying to you.

00:21.390 --> 00:24.310
Okay. Look. I'm sorry, okay.
I don't mean

00:24.350 --> 00:26.400
to be insensitive.
I'm sorry.

00:26.440 --> 00:28.650
It's okay.
Look, I gotta go.

00:28.690 --> 00:31.740
Please, just go to school.
Okay. Go to school please.

00:36.240 --> 00:37.370
Luke. Where are you?

00:37.410 --> 00:39.660
They got it, Sloan.
They took it all.

00:39.700 --> 00:41.000
Calm down. Who took it?

00:41.040 --> 00:41.910
The cops.

00:41.950 --> 00:43.000
They raided the warehouse.

00:43.040 --> 00:44.540
They're confiscating
everything.

00:44.580 --> 00:46.000
Wait. So the cops
have our shipment

00:46.040 --> 00:47.380
of designer knock-off
merchandise.

00:47.420 --> 00:50.300
All of it. I drove up I saw the
whole thing go down.

00:50.340 --> 00:51.550
You're an idiot. You
were supposed

00:51.590 --> 00:52.840
to pick it up last night.

00:52.880 --> 00:54.970
What are we gonna do?

00:55.010 --> 00:56.510
We owe Saul big time.

00:56.550 --> 00:58.970
I told you we shouldn't
have borrowed from him.

01:06.650 --> 01:08.190
I'm still not talking to you.

01:08.230 --> 01:09.770
Oh come on. You're not gonna
kick me out of the apartment

01:09.820 --> 01:10.860
because I'm dating Tinny.

01:10.900 --> 01:12.690
We both know that
you're not that guy.

01:12.730 --> 01:16.450
Des, I never, ever wanna
hear the words:

01:16.490 --> 01:18.370
"Dating Tinny" and
"my apartment"

01:18.410 --> 01:19.950
in the same sentence
ever again.

01:19.990 --> 01:22.040
Just so you know, we don't do
anything out of bounds--

01:22.080 --> 01:24.830
while we're in there.
We don't do anything ever.

01:24.870 --> 01:26.460
When I say we don't do
anything, anywhere--

01:26.500 --> 01:27.500
Obviously, I'm
being dishonest.

01:27.540 --> 01:28.460
That's ridiculous.

01:28.500 --> 01:29.670
But...

01:29.710 --> 01:31.340
I'm really glad we had today

01:31.380 --> 01:34.170
to talk and reconnect
about the whole thing

01:36.430 --> 01:38.090
Des, when I told
you to buy a locker--

01:38.140 --> 01:40.260
It was to take all your piles
of useless stuff

01:40.300 --> 01:42.060
And put it inside. Not buy
more piles of useless stuff.

01:42.100 --> 01:43.560
What do you want me to do?

01:43.600 --> 01:45.850
They're auctioning off an
entire locker full of treasure.

01:45.890 --> 01:47.270
Just think about it.
The deal I got.

01:47.310 --> 01:48.350
There could be anything in
there, man. Anything.

01:48.400 --> 01:49.310
Gold, whatever.

01:50.440 --> 01:51.650
Well, it looks like your
treasure chest

01:51.690 --> 01:53.360
has been broken into.

01:57.780 --> 01:59.370
Did she come with the
auction?

02:00.160 --> 02:02.080
-Hello.
-Hello.

02:02.120 --> 02:03.700
Wanna tell us what you're doing
in my friend's locker.

02:03.740 --> 02:05.250
We're still friends. Good.

02:05.290 --> 02:07.750
This is my locker. And I wanna
know. Where did you put it?

02:07.790 --> 02:09.750
What are you talking about?

02:10.500 --> 02:10.750
Okay, look.

02:12.300 --> 02:14.840
As much as I'd love to see
you kick Des's ass right now--

02:14.880 --> 02:17.300
Why don't we all take a
breath, have a conversation.

02:17.340 --> 02:19.140
And you tell is what
it is that you want.

02:19.180 --> 02:20.510
Of course.

02:25.100 --> 02:27.690
Wait, wait, wait!
Ah, my eyes.

02:28.980 --> 02:30.560
We just wanted to have

Uh, Jake. You might
wanna see this.

02:47.790 --> 02:49.870
Is the pepper spray messing
with my head?

02:49.920 --> 02:52.580
Or are you holding a human foot?

02:52.630 --> 02:53.800
[Murdoch] It's not the
pepper spray.

02:54.920 --> 02:56.460
Now if you'd kindly raise
your hands.

02:57.090 --> 02:58.720

that's weird right now

05:59.980 --> 06:02.110
is that you're even having
this conversation with me.

already told me off. I'm sick.

07:38.330 --> 07:39.370
Where's Murdoch?

07:39.410 --> 07:44.540
He um. He had to go--

07:44.580 --> 07:45.960
He had to look into
a bit of a lead.

07:46.000 --> 07:46.800
But he said he'd be back.

07:46.840 --> 07:48.090
But I have him my cell

07:48.130 --> 07:50.340
and my e-mail. He really wants
to find Felicity.

07:50.380 --> 07:52.800

sprayed you.

07:52.840 --> 07:54.470
Yeah, I wouldn't mind
talking to her either.

07:54.510 --> 07:55.890
Good. 'Cause he hired
us to find her.

07:55.930 --> 07:57.760
And he paid in advance.

07:57.810 --> 07:59.310
He flew all the way
here to help her.

07:59.350 --> 08:00.640
Probably on points, but still.

08:00.680 --> 08:03.650
So we find a severed foot.

08:03.690 --> 08:06.570

missies who pepper sprays me.

a gig out of it.

Wow. Thanks.

He paid us a lot.

08:16.580 --> 08:18.870
He paid us a lot.

08:20.200 --> 08:22.580
I need you to stay here
and somehow figure out

08:22.620 --> 08:25.330
why Murdoch wants
to find Felicity so badly.

Alone? So when comes back,
I'm teamed with him?

08:28.460 --> 08:30.590

to be about us.

08:32.340 --> 08:35.930

who's the owner of this foot.

severed foot?

08:44.480 --> 08:45.900
I don't.

08:45.940 --> 08:47.310
So am I hallucinating?

08:47.360 --> 08:49.320
Look, I just need
you to find out

08:49.360 --> 08:51.400
some information
for me, okay--

08:51.440 --> 08:54.200
on whoever owns this foot. If
you wouldn't mind, on the QT.

08:54.240 --> 08:56.990
On the QT? Is this your way of
trying to get me into bed

08:57.030 --> 08:58.830
because it's a terrible
strategy.

09:03.000 --> 09:05.330
Sorry, I didn't mean to--
I just came to get a file.

09:05.370 --> 09:07.380
That's okay, Simon.
Jake, this is--

09:07.420 --> 09:09.750
Simon Eagleson.
Also a medical examiner.

09:09.800 --> 09:10.670
How are you doing?

09:12.630 --> 09:13.470
Simon is from the Mainland.

09:13.510 --> 09:14.970
Ah.

09:15.010 --> 09:17.300
He's in town for an exchange
for a few weeks. You know--

09:17.340 --> 09:19.890
Police Forces exchanging
information.

09:21.020 --> 09:22.430
I gotta go.

09:22.470 --> 09:24.230
Cool man. Right on.

09:24.850 --> 09:25.770
We have to talk--

09:25.810 --> 09:26.770
later.

09:26.810 --> 09:28.520
What am I supposed
to do with this?

09:28.560 --> 09:33.990
Um--I don't know what--
Thanks.

09:43.750 --> 09:45.370
Oh. You're back.
How was your lead?

09:45.410 --> 09:46.580
I was searching some of
the local hotels

09:46.620 --> 09:47.870
and hostels to see if

09:47.920 --> 09:49.880
one of them might be where
Felicity is staying.

09:49.920 --> 09:50.840
Any luck?

09:50.880 --> 09:52.210
Unfortunately, no.

09:52.250 --> 09:52.300
You know, no offence.

09:53.800 --> 09:55.840
But I'm really not happy
that Jake paired us up together.

09:55.880 --> 09:57.720
Today was supposed to
be a Jake and Des day.

09:57.760 --> 09:59.640
Not some stupid you and Des day.

09:59.680 --> 10:01.260
And we got some issues
we are trying to work out

10:01.300 --> 10:03.470
And I'm not gonna
get into it with you.

10:03.520 --> 10:04.810
We're having some problems.

10:04.850 --> 10:07.140
Because I'm dating his
insanely hot niece, Tinny.

10:07.190 --> 10:09.350
I'm pretty sure
we love each other.

10:09.400 --> 10:12.650
So Felicity was standing here
when you entered the locker.

10:12.690 --> 10:13.650
Did she look like she was
searching

10:13.690 --> 10:14.900
for anything in particular?

10:14.940 --> 10:17.950
Yes, man. I told you.
That chest over there.

10:17.990 --> 10:19.820
Anyway. Tinny is wicked.

10:19.860 --> 10:22.030
You'd really like her.
Everybody does.

10:23.450 --> 10:25.000
Look, buddy. I knows
what you're thinking.

10:25.040 --> 10:26.660
Okay. I went through that trunk.

10:26.710 --> 10:28.870
Up and down.
There's nothing.

10:31.210 --> 10:32.380
Except that.

10:34.340 --> 10:37.800
Those look like a bunch of tools
people who rob things would use

10:37.840 --> 10:39.430
Umhmm. This doesn't
look good.

10:39.470 --> 10:41.550
I was hoping Felicity might
have moved on from this.

10:41.600 --> 10:42.890
[Des]
You do know, that

10:42.930 --> 10:45.560
when I saw her, she was
holding a severed foot.

10:45.600 --> 10:48.270
Yes. Felicity has a
history of criminal activity.

10:48.310 --> 10:50.940
But she would never hurt anyone.

10:50.980 --> 10:51.860
Someone's coming.

10:55.650 --> 10:56.570
Oh, hi.

10:56.610 --> 10:57.610
-Hello.
-Hi.

10:57.650 --> 10:59.450
I'm Chad King.

10:59.490 --> 11:00.160
Can we help you?

11:00.200 --> 11:01.530
[Chad]
No, no, no.

11:01.570 --> 11:04.330
I'm just doing my, you know,
security rounds and--

11:05.580 --> 11:07.290
I'm the owner of this
establishment. So--

11:07.330 --> 11:08.710
Well, this is my locker.

11:08.750 --> 11:11.920
Okay. I was just making sure
that everything's safe.

11:11.960 --> 11:14.920
And, from the looks
of it, it is. So--

11:16.340 --> 11:18.630
Okay. Good for you.

11:23.220 --> 11:24.970
-Desmond, is it?
-Yeah.

11:25.010 --> 11:26.180
I'm gonna check out
more hotels.

11:26.220 --> 11:27.680
You stay here.

11:27.720 --> 11:30.480
If Felicity shows up, call
me. I need to speak with her.

11:30.520 --> 11:31.560
Yeah.

11:39.400 --> 11:40.950
Took you long enough.

11:40.990 --> 11:42.660
Oh, yes b'y. You would have
camped out here for three weeks

11:42.700 --> 11:44.410
if it means staying
away from Rose's mother.

11:44.450 --> 11:46.830
Shut up.
Here.

11:46.870 --> 11:47.990
Murdoch's a detective.

11:48.040 --> 11:49.080
Comes from a long line
of cops.

11:49.120 --> 11:50.710
Blood's as blue as it comes.

11:50.750 --> 11:53.210
But for some reason his file is
blocked. I got a call through

11:53.250 --> 11:54.500
to a guy from his department.

11:54.540 --> 11:56.000
What about missus here?

11:56.040 --> 11:58.210
She's got a reputation of
being a pretty successful

11:58.250 --> 12:00.170
criminal. B and E's, heists,
you name it.

12:00.220 --> 12:01.670
What's her connection
to Murdoch?

12:01.720 --> 12:04.930
She's only been caught once.
By Bill Murdoch, years ago.

12:04.970 --> 12:05.970
Okay. so she's a felon.

12:06.010 --> 12:07.510
Bill Murdoch, he arrests her.

12:07.560 --> 12:09.980
And then he follows her all
the way to Newfoundland. Why?

12:10.020 --> 12:11.520
She was sprung
because she copped

12:11.560 --> 12:12.730
a deal to keep her out of jail.

12:12.770 --> 12:14.060
And Murdoch--
helped her, apparently.

12:14.100 --> 12:15.360
Yeah, look at her.
I dare say he did.

12:15.940 --> 12:16.900
Where's she now?

12:16.940 --> 12:17.610
Planning a job?

12:18.360 --> 12:19.610
Murdoch's chasing her?

12:19.650 --> 12:22.030
Okay. Why did he hire us?

12:22.070 --> 12:24.410
[ring]

12:26.370 --> 12:29.450
Hi, so are we still being
jerks to each other or--

12:29.500 --> 12:30.410
No.

12:30.450 --> 12:31.620
I just wanted to let you know

12:31.660 --> 12:33.000
that Rose dropped
me off at school.

12:33.040 --> 12:33.710
So you're not sick.

12:33.750 --> 12:35.250
You were lying to me.

12:35.290 --> 12:38.210
Right. Look. Any chance I can
get a hike in my allowance?

12:38.250 --> 12:39.550
Since when do you get
an allowance?

12:39.590 --> 12:41.920
That's what Dads do.
They give their kids money.

12:41.970 --> 12:43.590
Wait. What did you do?

12:43.630 --> 12:45.180
Why do you need this cash?

12:45.220 --> 12:47.890
I just do! Why do you always
think I did something wrong?

12:48.510 --> 12:48.560
Look, Sloan.

12:50.180 --> 12:52.560
I don't know if you noticed,
but I'm an investigator, okay?

12:52.600 --> 12:55.600
It's my job to figure out when
people are lying, or not.

12:55.650 --> 12:57.230
So why don't you just come
clean with me right now.

12:57.270 --> 12:58.230
Tell me what you want.
See if I can help you.

12:59.070 --> 13:00.440
You know what? Never mind.

13:00.480 --> 13:01.360
[beep]

13:03.030 --> 13:06.870
She's sixteen. It's almost the
worst year of all of them.

13:06.910 --> 13:09.780
Fantastic.

13:09.830 --> 13:11.870
Do me a favor. Just keep
looking into Felicity

13:11.910 --> 13:14.500
and see if you can find
a connection between her

13:14.540 --> 13:16.040
And that severed foot.

13:21.300 --> 13:23.010
Luke.

13:23.050 --> 13:25.130
Shut up and stop whining.

13:25.170 --> 13:27.050
I've got a way to get some
of the cash.

13:29.890 --> 13:31.010
Where's Murdoch?

13:31.060 --> 13:33.350
Oh, he’s off looking into
every B and B,

13:33.390 --> 13:35.270
every hotel, every anything

13:35.310 --> 13:37.190
trying to find out where
Felicity is staying. Here.

13:37.230 --> 13:38.730
He really wants to find
her, huh?

13:38.770 --> 13:40.940
Yes, he does. Can I
run a theory by you?

13:40.980 --> 13:42.400
Keep in mind, it's just a
theory at this point.

13:42.440 --> 13:43.690
But I think I'm onto
something.

13:43.740 --> 13:45.860
-Give 'er.
-Okay so Murdoch right,

13:45.900 --> 13:48.450
He flies all the way here to
help out his friend Felicity,

13:48.490 --> 13:50.160
which is so sweet, right?

13:50.200 --> 13:51.700
-Yes.
-But--

13:51.740 --> 13:55.250
I think that Murdoch has
a thing for Felicity.

13:55.290 --> 13:57.500
And I can tell, because I
knows when a man's in love.

13:57.540 --> 13:59.710
And I don't wanna get into why
you know that, okay.

13:59.750 --> 14:01.460
We show up, right?

14:01.500 --> 14:03.210
She has a severed foot. But
she's looking or something else.

14:03.250 --> 14:05.090
And she's frantic.
She's going crazy--

14:05.130 --> 14:05.840
-Des.
-Okay. Anyway I'm hurrying. So,

14:07.380 --> 14:08.970
she can't find whatever
it is she's looking for, right?

14:09.010 --> 14:09.640
And then buddy shows up.

14:10.350 --> 14:12.470
This guy--Chad King.

14:13.140 --> 14:14.600
-Right?
-Yeah.

14:14.640 --> 14:16.480
So I think he's stealing
from all the lockers.

14:16.520 --> 14:17.770
[Jake]
Is he the owner?

14:17.810 --> 14:19.350
[Des] Yes, he's the owner.
And I looked into--

14:19.400 --> 14:19.860
his Wi-Fi.

14:20.940 --> 14:22.980
turns out he's
been auctioning off

14:23.020 --> 14:25.480
and double and triple renting
out all the lockers

14:25.530 --> 14:28.820
which is why I ended up with
the same locker as Felicity.

14:28.860 --> 14:32.990
And I think he's storing
it all in here.

14:33.030 --> 14:36.200
So he's using this place as
his own personal vault.

14:36.250 --> 14:38.710
It's a pretty hefty lock. He's
obviously protecting something.

14:40.080 --> 14:40.420
Liquid nitrogen.

14:41.840 --> 14:45.420
Been saving it for a special
occasion. Stand back.

14:50.340 --> 14:51.550
Oh, hand me that,
hand me that.

14:54.350 --> 14:55.060
Shhh.

14:55.520 --> 14:56.640
[crash]

14:58.060 --> 14:59.060
Just hurry up.

15:01.770 --> 15:02.520
That's heavy.

15:02.940 --> 15:03.820
[bang]

15:08.990 --> 15:10.490
Right?

15:10.530 --> 15:11.490
It's a good job,
Des.

15:11.530 --> 15:12.870
It was a great job Des.

15:12.910 --> 15:14.530
What are we looking for?

15:14.580 --> 15:18.660
Who knows? I think he's after
robbing a good few spots, so--

15:21.920 --> 15:23.290
Look at this.

15:23.340 --> 15:24.670
[ring]

15:27.170 --> 15:28.920
-Hey there.
-[Mal] Check your phone.

15:28.970 --> 15:30.260
You're new pretty friend Jessica

15:30.300 --> 15:32.340
at the police station
sent me this.

15:34.510 --> 15:35.850
Is she the owner of the foot?

15:35.890 --> 15:37.560
Felicity's cousin,
Robin Shephard.

15:37.600 --> 15:40.440
She's an avid hiker who's been
missing for the last few days.

15:40.480 --> 15:41.020
Felicity's cousin?

15:41.850 --> 15:43.230
Robin's family has a fortune

15:43.270 --> 15:47.030
The own a nickel mine. Robin's
set to inherit it but

15:47.070 --> 15:48.190
If she's out of the picture..

15:48.230 --> 15:49.610
Felicity's next in line.

15:49.650 --> 15:50.570
I'll look into it.

15:50.610 --> 15:51.030
Thanks.

15:52.200 --> 15:54.870
Look at this. Felicity's
locker invoice.

15:54.910 --> 15:57.490
There's no address. But look,
there's a phone number.

15:57.540 --> 15:59.410
Why don't we just
give it a call?

16:01.040 --> 16:02.370
Male Voice" August's B and B.

16:02.420 --> 16:04.790
Yeah, I'm looking
for a guest--

16:05.460 --> 16:06.380
Felicity Shepherd.

16:06.420 --> 16:07.380
Yeah, I know her name.

16:07.420 --> 16:09.210
Her name is Felicity Shepherd.

16:09.260 --> 16:10.630
One moment please.

16:11.930 --> 16:14.140
Call Murdoch. Tell him I'm
gonna pick him up.

16:20.770 --> 16:23.230
You know. I have a theory about
why you came back

16:23.270 --> 16:24.310
to help Felicity

16:24.350 --> 16:25.400
Is that so?

16:25.440 --> 16:27.360
Okay well, it's not my
theory it's Des'

16:27.400 --> 16:28.730
but I fully endorse it.

16:29.940 --> 16:32.150
We think that maybe you
might have some

16:33.110 --> 16:35.110
romantic history
with this woman.

16:35.160 --> 16:36.450
All right, it's true. Felicity
and I do have a past.

16:37.870 --> 16:40.080
But that was a different place
and different time.

16:40.120 --> 16:41.620
Why I'm here now is purely--

16:41.660 --> 16:42.750
Alright!

16:42.790 --> 16:44.120
Purely what, Murdoch.
Why are you here?

16:44.170 --> 16:45.580
Take me to where you put
my pocket watch.

16:45.630 --> 16:46.790
I do not have any time
for games!

16:46.840 --> 16:48.340
Easy, alright.

16:48.380 --> 16:50.260
I told you we could come up
with some sort of arrangement.

16:50.300 --> 16:51.210
That's why I come up here.

16:51.260 --> 16:52.420
Felicity?

16:54.550 --> 16:55.260
Billy?

16:56.010 --> 16:59.470
Hey. You look beautiful.

17:00.810 --> 17:01.850
Thank you.

17:03.850 --> 17:04.690
But I gotta take you in.

17:05.190 --> 17:06.600
No, no, Billy.

17:06.650 --> 17:08.110
You think I hurt my cousin?
I'm trying to save Robin.

17:09.270 --> 17:11.030
I know you robbed the two
million dollars.

17:11.650 --> 17:12.610
I knew all along.

17:12.650 --> 17:14.030
But now I have proof.

17:14.070 --> 17:15.450
Bill straps from the bank.

17:17.240 --> 17:18.120
Ah!

17:20.120 --> 17:20.580
Give me that!

17:22.040 --> 17:24.370
You gotta stop pepper spraying
everyone that you see!

17:24.410 --> 17:25.370
Great job.

17:25.420 --> 17:26.250
You just
killed my cousin.

17:26.290 --> 17:27.580
What are you talking about?

17:27.630 --> 17:29.250
Robin's been kidnapped and
Chad is the only thing

17:29.290 --> 17:30.340
that can get her back.

17:39.930 --> 17:41.350
Chad has my pocket watch.

17:41.390 --> 17:43.020
And unless I get it back,
I'm never gonna see Robin again.

17:43.060 --> 17:44.230
Do you understand that?

17:44.270 --> 17:46.480
Slow down okay what
are you talking about?

17:46.520 --> 17:47.810
what do you mean
your cousin is missing?

17:47.850 --> 17:49.110
Slow down? This idiot just

17:49.150 --> 17:51.400
told me to slow down?
Robin's been kidnapped.

17:51.440 --> 17:52.400
Okay.

17:52.440 --> 17:53.360
Who kidnapped her?

17:53.400 --> 17:54.400
And what do they want?

17:54.440 --> 17:54.780
[Murdoch] The robbery.

17:55.740 --> 17:56.820
Whoever's got your cousin knows

17:56.860 --> 17:58.240
you have the two
million dollars.

17:58.280 --> 17:59.660
Whoever it is knows
I pulled the job.

17:59.700 --> 18:01.280
And if I don't get
them the money--

18:01.330 --> 18:03.370
Robin's gonna be sent to
me piece by piece.

18:03.410 --> 18:05.660
Okay. The pocket watch
has something to do

18:05.710 --> 18:07.670
with where you got the
money stashed. How?

18:07.710 --> 18:09.580
I buried the money in
a remote location.

18:09.630 --> 18:11.840
And I left a GPS transmitter.
So I could dig it up--

18:11.880 --> 18:14.090
later. The receiver
is in the watch.

18:14.130 --> 18:15.170
And Chad has that.

18:15.800 --> 18:17.380
Where could he be?

18:17.430 --> 18:20.430
Drop me off at Chad's locker if
he shows up there I'll find him.

18:20.470 --> 18:23.140
Billy. Don't be mad, please.

18:24.600 --> 18:27.980
You. I'm just gonna leave you
with my father, alright?

18:28.020 --> 18:29.350
Until I figure out what
to do next.

18:35.190 --> 18:36.280
Where's Jess?

18:36.320 --> 18:38.030
I ran the test for Jessica.

18:38.070 --> 18:40.280
She's a busy person. And I don't
think she appreciates her--

18:40.320 --> 18:41.700
Whatever you are--

18:41.740 --> 18:43.410
Asking her to run
errands for you.

18:43.450 --> 18:46.710
She doesn't appreciate it.
Or you don't.

18:46.750 --> 18:47.910
I'd say both of us.

18:47.960 --> 18:50.290
Look. it's a human foot.
Okay, not a cat.

18:50.330 --> 18:53.170
I couldn't run this through the
proper channels at this station.

18:53.210 --> 18:55.000
It's actually kind of a
complicated situation.

18:55.050 --> 18:57.920
Yeah, I don't care if it's a
complicated situation.

18:57.970 --> 19:00.140
Don't get Jessica tangled up in
anything that'll get her into--

19:00.180 --> 19:01.590
trouble.
You got me?

19:01.640 --> 19:03.760
It's the only reason I'm not
reporting any of this.

19:08.640 --> 19:11.480
What did you ask him to do?
Run a check on a severed head?

19:11.520 --> 19:14.320
Ha, ha. No, I think your buddy
Eagleson there is--

19:14.360 --> 19:16.440
A little bit in love with you.
He just got very,

19:16.480 --> 19:18.610
very protective.

19:18.650 --> 19:20.320
Maybe it's because you brought
in a severed foot.

19:20.360 --> 19:23.070
And asked me to run it for
you without telling my boss.

19:23.120 --> 19:25.120
Yeah, he might be a little bit
protective about that.

19:26.240 --> 19:28.660
That was stupid thing
for me to do.

19:28.700 --> 19:31.170
You should be thanking
Eagleson.

19:31.210 --> 19:32.380
I was gonna report
the whole thing,

19:32.420 --> 19:34.670
but he stopped me
from telling Leslie.

19:35.460 --> 19:36.630
Tell me what?

19:36.670 --> 19:37.550
Leslie.

19:38.590 --> 19:39.930
I should go.

19:41.090 --> 19:42.300
What's this?

19:46.640 --> 19:48.520
A human foot I found.

19:49.680 --> 19:52.060
It's connected to a case
I'm working on.

19:52.100 --> 19:53.230
I asked Jess--

19:53.270 --> 19:56.230
to run some tests for me.
And she--

19:56.270 --> 19:58.900
So, you're getting her to your
dirty work for you now?

19:58.940 --> 19:59.860
Don't, Leslie.

19:59.900 --> 20:00.820
It isn't like that?

20:00.860 --> 20:01.780
[Leslie]
Is this anything

20:01.820 --> 20:03.360
we should
know about?

20:03.410 --> 20:05.700
We ran it against
a sample of DNA.

20:05.740 --> 20:09.950
A woman named Robin
Shepherd owns the foot.

20:10.000 --> 20:12.080
And it was removed while
she was still alive.

20:12.120 --> 20:13.790
It's a missing persons case
I'm working on.

20:13.830 --> 20:16.840
So if you happen to hear
anything about a missus

20:16.880 --> 20:19.380
missing a foot,

20:19.420 --> 20:21.430
It would be great if you could
let me know.

20:22.840 --> 20:23.760
Um, excuse me.

20:34.730 --> 20:36.020
[Des] There's nothing
on this computer.

20:36.060 --> 20:38.280
Nothing of use, anyway.
Are you having any luck?

20:41.070 --> 20:42.650
I thought, stupidly--

20:42.700 --> 20:45.700
I thought that maybe Felicity
had changed her ways.

20:45.740 --> 20:48.120
Now I find out I was wrong,
I feel like an idiot.

20:48.160 --> 20:51.120
Look-- I know we just met but
sometimes the women that we want

20:52.410 --> 20:54.420
They're not the women
that we want them to be.

20:54.460 --> 20:56.380
You sound like a man with first
hand experience

20:56.420 --> 20:57.840
in these matters.

20:57.880 --> 21:00.050
God no. Tinny's exactly
like the way I want her to be.

21:00.090 --> 21:01.880
I just know people
who've been in your position.

21:01.920 --> 21:02.840
It sucks.

21:02.880 --> 21:04.090
Yeah.

21:04.130 --> 21:04.890
Lease.

21:05.470 --> 21:06.680
Let me see that.

21:06.720 --> 21:08.430
We're looking for Chad.

21:08.470 --> 21:10.510
-We got Chad's sports car lease.
-So?

21:10.560 --> 21:12.270
So this type of car is
I-Star Assistance.

21:12.310 --> 21:13.640
I can find his car, no problem.

21:13.690 --> 21:15.310
Just a sec.

21:18.900 --> 21:20.110
There it is. Chad's car.

21:20.150 --> 21:21.900
It's downtown across from
Hotel Newfoundland.

21:21.940 --> 21:23.700
-I'll call Jake.
-Very good.

21:24.280 --> 21:24.910
Actually, Des.

21:26.030 --> 21:27.700
I need that phone,
just for a second.

21:30.660 --> 21:33.580
Where are you going?
No! No, no no!

21:39.920 --> 21:41.050
So she's alive.

21:41.920 --> 21:43.710
That's what we think, yeah.

21:43.760 --> 21:46.220
What kind of sick
person would do this?

21:46.260 --> 21:47.680
What can you tell us
about Murdoch?

21:48.260 --> 21:49.430
What do you mean?

21:49.470 --> 21:51.640
He told us he was a cop, but
I just found out

21:51.680 --> 21:52.850
he's been off the
force for a while.

21:52.890 --> 21:54.350
What's he hiding?

21:54.390 --> 21:57.020
When I do jobs, it's
normally big scores.

21:57.060 --> 21:59.270
Before he took me down--
He was the only

21:59.310 --> 21:59.730
cop to do that, by the way--

22:00.940 --> 22:04.030
Billy and I had a personal
relationship.

22:05.360 --> 22:07.610
Wait, if Murdoch's the one who
took you down--

22:07.660 --> 22:09.240
He made a deal with the judge
to get me off

22:09.280 --> 22:10.990
if I help the cops
on other cases.

22:11.030 --> 22:12.910
It ended up getting him fired
because people suspected--

22:12.950 --> 22:15.290
Murdoch was working with you
from the inside.

22:15.330 --> 22:17.460
He risked everything for me.
And in the end, it got him.

22:18.170 --> 22:19.500
And he's doing it again.

22:19.540 --> 22:21.090
I mean, by showing up here. I
never asked him to.

22:21.130 --> 22:22.670
I had no idea.

22:22.710 --> 22:26.380
Wait...No. Murdoch told me that
you asked him to come here.

22:26.420 --> 22:29.430
No, I have already done
enough damage to that guy.

22:29.470 --> 22:31.010
I wanted him to stay away.

22:31.050 --> 22:33.310
So, who else knows about you

22:33.350 --> 22:35.730
and the latest two
million dollar robbery?

22:35.770 --> 22:37.480
No one.

22:37.520 --> 22:40.060
But I guess I am the number one
suspect on file with the police.

22:42.860 --> 22:44.480
Even though he's not a
cop anymore, he could

22:44.530 --> 22:46.570
have access to all
of this information.

22:47.240 --> 22:48.570
Revenge?
Could be.

22:49.570 --> 22:50.530
I better call Des
and warn him.

22:50.570 --> 22:52.280
He's with Murdoch right now.

22:53.370 --> 22:57.120
[ringing]

23:03.130 --> 23:05.340
Thank you gene pool for these
unusually long arms.

23:06.670 --> 23:09.220
Jake. It's Murdoch. He locked
me in the locker.

23:09.260 --> 23:10.180
What?

23:10.220 --> 23:11.180
Where's he headed?

23:11.220 --> 23:11.680
Chad's car, we tracked it down.

23:12.760 --> 23:13.930
It's Great Big She
the strip club.

23:13.970 --> 23:15.260
Okay. Bye.

23:15.310 --> 23:17.020
How am I gonna get out of
here? Hello? Oh my--

23:17.890 --> 23:19.440
I gotta go to a strip club.

23:25.190 --> 23:26.650
Hey now. What are
you doing here?

23:26.690 --> 23:28.240
You knows I can't
be having no trouble.

23:28.280 --> 23:29.320
Finn.

23:29.360 --> 23:30.950
Relax. We don't want any
trouble. Okay?

23:32.570 --> 23:34.740
We're looking for this guy.
Have you seen him around today?

23:34.780 --> 23:35.700
Pay the cover
and you can go in.

23:37.160 --> 23:39.370
Finn, we only wanna go inside
for a couple of seconds.

23:39.410 --> 23:40.540
Yeah, but the girls are naked,

23:40.580 --> 23:42.000
no matter how long
you're in there, Jake.

23:42.040 --> 23:44.500
So, twenty bucks each.

23:44.540 --> 23:47.300
And, if you're nice, I might
throw in a Kaluha and Coke.

23:47.340 --> 23:48.720
Bill us.

23:53.550 --> 23:55.970
-Chad. Remember me?
-Whoa, whoa, whoa.

23:56.010 --> 23:58.100
Ladies this is not my wife
you can keep dancing.

23:58.140 --> 24:00.020
Watch, now, or
this will get ugly.

24:00.060 --> 24:02.060
Chad, we just want the watch,
okay. We don't want any trouble.

24:02.100 --> 24:03.350
And why would
I give it to ya?

24:03.400 --> 24:04.770
'Cause I'll kill you
if you don't.

24:04.810 --> 24:06.650
Okay you know what?
neither of you have any right

24:06.690 --> 24:07.820
to be interrupting
me lap dances

24:09.070 --> 24:11.360
I paid for that dance.
Don't dance for him.

24:11.400 --> 24:13.030
If you don't mind. It's not
too much to ask, maybe?

24:14.320 --> 24:16.450
You know what? Forget this.
I'm outta here.

24:17.830 --> 24:20.330
How exactly would you like
this to go down, Chad?

24:20.370 --> 24:21.870
Because at your current pace,
it's gonna end very

24:21.910 --> 24:22.960
badly for you.

24:23.000 --> 24:25.000
Pocket watch.
Where is my GPS?

24:25.040 --> 24:27.380
Well, you know the thing
about that is--

24:28.250 --> 24:29.130
Uhh!

24:29.840 --> 24:31.050
I warned you.

24:31.090 --> 24:32.300
Hey! Get off me.

24:32.340 --> 24:33.800
Hang on now.
Put her down now.

24:35.090 --> 24:36.470
[Finn]
All ye crowd out!

24:37.600 --> 24:38.890
Ah! You see what you
made me do!

24:39.520 --> 24:40.560
All ye crowd out!

24:40.980 --> 24:41.850
Get off!

24:42.440 --> 24:43.770
[bang]

24:44.270 --> 24:45.360
Police?

24:46.650 --> 24:48.480
Oh, wait. Hold on.

24:48.520 --> 24:49.980
Why don't we just have a --

24:50.030 --> 24:51.070
-drink.
-[smack]

24:51.110 --> 24:52.110
[Finn] Jake Doyle is causing
a regular

24:52.150 --> 24:53.410
racket down here
at Great Big She.

24:54.660 --> 24:56.570
Here. I think there's
a drop left in that.

24:56.620 --> 24:57.830
[Finn] Jake, your
missus got this place--

24:57.870 --> 24:58.580
broke up!

24:58.620 --> 24:59.910
-Did you get it?
-Yeah

24:59.950 --> 25:01.040
with this we can find where
the money is buried

25:01.080 --> 25:02.210
and get Robin back.

25:02.250 --> 25:03.540
Felicity Shepherd?

25:04.250 --> 25:05.460
Come on!

25:05.500 --> 25:07.500
I did a little check in
to Robin Shepherd.

25:07.540 --> 25:09.550
Jake's so- called
missing persons case.

25:09.590 --> 25:10.800
Oh man.

25:10.840 --> 25:11.670
I need you to come with me.

25:12.760 --> 25:15.300
I'll come with you.
Just find Robin.

25:22.640 --> 25:26.270
Whoa. Sorry, I'll get
out of your hair.

25:26.310 --> 25:29.150
You guys just carry on doing
whatever it is that you--

25:29.190 --> 25:30.780
are doing.

25:31.780 --> 25:34.110
Dad. I'm coming to
pick you up.

25:39.620 --> 25:40.620
[Mal] The money
should be up here

25:40.660 --> 25:42.330
if this GPS
thing is working.

25:51.000 --> 25:52.130
Ah...

25:54.300 --> 25:56.010
-Murdoch?
-Jake.

25:57.260 --> 25:58.800
This is nothing like
what it looks like.

25:59.550 --> 26:01.180
Drop the shovel. Now.

26:04.890 --> 26:05.890
Here's the tracker.

26:06.770 --> 26:08.060
At least Chad's still alive.

26:08.900 --> 26:10.230
Were you trying to kill him?

26:10.270 --> 26:12.570
Of course not. Chad was like
that when I got here.

26:12.610 --> 26:14.990
And how is it that you got
here, if we had this?

26:15.030 --> 26:16.360
I followed Chad
out of the club.

26:17.280 --> 26:19.030
He got yanked into a dark SUV.

26:19.070 --> 26:20.910
I pursued them,
but then, I lost them.

26:20.950 --> 26:21.950
You lost them.

26:21.990 --> 26:23.410
Right. By the time
I arrived here...

26:23.450 --> 26:25.160
All you found was an empty
hole with no money in it.

26:26.500 --> 26:29.250
You're not a cop any more.
You didn't tell us.

26:29.290 --> 26:31.340
You were kicked off
the force. Why?

26:31.380 --> 26:32.670
I was trying to help Felicity
go straight.

26:33.880 --> 26:35.130
But they thought I
was working with her.

26:36.170 --> 26:37.840
I lost everything
because of her.

26:37.880 --> 26:40.300
And you followed Felicity to
Newfoundland because--

26:40.340 --> 26:44.560
I followed her because
I'm in love with her.

26:47.230 --> 26:48.690
-Where is she?
-[Mal] She's in custody.

26:48.730 --> 26:49.770
Leslie picked her
up for questioning

26:49.810 --> 26:51.900
about the two
million bucks.

26:51.940 --> 26:54.940
Apparently she's the Toronto
Police's prime suspect.

26:54.980 --> 26:56.860
Felicity's cousin.
She's still missing.

26:56.900 --> 26:59.150
We have to find that money so
we can get her back.

26:59.200 --> 27:02.120
If we had the GPS, how did
Chad know the money was here?

27:02.160 --> 27:03.280
He must have came here before.

27:03.330 --> 27:04.990
He grabbed the money,
and then took off.

27:05.040 --> 27:06.330
If you just found two

27:06.370 --> 27:08.460
million bucks, where's the
first place you'd go?

27:08.500 --> 27:09.830
I know where you'd go.

27:10.500 --> 27:13.380
-[ring]
-Des.

27:13.420 --> 27:15.050
I managed to get out of
that locked storage locker.

27:15.090 --> 27:17.010
Oh, how'd you manage
to do that Des?

27:17.050 --> 27:18.800
Are you okay?
Yeah I'm totally fine Jake.

27:18.840 --> 27:20.180
Thanks so much for asking.

27:20.220 --> 27:21.470
Yeah. Sorry about that.

27:21.510 --> 27:22.590
Well, more importantly--

27:22.640 --> 27:24.220
We got a really
interesting delivery

27:24.260 --> 27:25.970
here at the office and it's...

27:26.020 --> 27:27.270
it's beyond gross.

27:28.310 --> 27:29.440
It's a human ear.

27:29.480 --> 27:31.310
Oh Dear God. That poor woman.

27:31.350 --> 27:33.440
The kidnapper left a number to
text when we had the money.

27:33.480 --> 27:34.940
How long do we have?

27:34.980 --> 27:35.900
They're threatening to kill
her if we don't have it

27:35.940 --> 27:37.280
in an hour.

27:37.320 --> 27:38.240
Thanks.

27:38.280 --> 27:39.150
Let's go.

27:43.870 --> 27:45.030
What is that?

27:45.080 --> 27:47.660
That is--
That's a long story.

27:47.700 --> 27:48.870
And what are you planning
to do with it?

27:48.910 --> 27:50.160
Well, I was gonna put it in ice,

27:50.210 --> 27:52.040
but Jake doesn't
really fill the ice trays.

27:52.080 --> 27:54.960
So maybe I'll just use--

27:55.000 --> 27:56.250
the bar downstairs.

27:56.300 --> 27:57.800
And put it in the freezer.

27:57.840 --> 28:01.970
Because that's really cold
and I'm some smart. Right?

28:09.600 --> 28:11.730
Gotta have some money in here
somewhere. Where is it?

28:36.630 --> 28:37.840
[Finn]
Well, well, well.

28:37.880 --> 28:40.050
Look who's back. Jake and--

28:40.090 --> 28:41.300
The old man Malachy. Well--

28:41.340 --> 28:42.720
He's not getting back in here

28:42.760 --> 28:44.720
You know how much trouble he
got me into with my boss?

28:44.760 --> 28:46.970
Finn. Someone's life is at
stake. I'm sorry.

28:47.010 --> 28:49.350
Chad King.
He left a bag here.

28:49.390 --> 28:50.930
Now, just a question now.

28:50.970 --> 28:53.600
Is there anything, say, worth
anything in this bag--

28:53.640 --> 28:55.350
that's allegedly
on the property?

28:55.400 --> 28:58.480
Get out of my way, Finn, or
I swear to God. Get out, Up.

29:08.950 --> 29:10.160
Got it.

29:10.200 --> 29:13.080
[Finn] Now, now. No need
to go rushing off eh?

29:13.120 --> 29:15.330
Finn. Thanks for
being a gent.

29:17.750 --> 29:18.800
Here it is.

29:24.840 --> 29:26.140
I don't see a missing girl.

29:27.100 --> 29:27.970
Look.

29:28.760 --> 29:29.930
Leave the money and go.

29:29.970 --> 29:31.850
[Jake]
Robin 1074.

29:31.890 --> 29:32.930
Pass me that bag.

29:35.980 --> 29:36.860
Insurance.

29:37.980 --> 29:38.860
Good call.

29:40.860 --> 29:42.240
Is that a compliment?

29:42.860 --> 29:44.650
Let's go to 1074.

29:45.610 --> 29:47.860
Okay. I'll go get Robin.

29:47.910 --> 29:49.490
You stay here and see
if anyone comes or goes.

29:49.530 --> 29:50.740
Yeah. Hurry.

30:05.010 --> 30:06.380
Don't worry.
I'm here to help.

30:07.680 --> 30:08.970
Kidnapper?

30:09.010 --> 30:10.970
I was drugged.
I didn't see much.

30:14.680 --> 30:15.560
What's wrong?

30:18.400 --> 30:19.270
What are you doing?

30:21.730 --> 30:23.070
Your foot isn't missing.

30:23.860 --> 30:25.820
You are Robin Shepherd?

30:26.570 --> 30:29.740
Yes.
What's going on?

30:33.990 --> 30:35.500
You find Robin?

30:35.540 --> 30:37.790
Yeah. She's out in the car,
and guess what?

30:37.830 --> 30:41.340
She's got both ears
and both feet.

30:41.380 --> 30:42.710
Wait a second.

30:42.750 --> 30:45.510
Jake. The money.

30:51.640 --> 30:53.180
That's impossible.

30:53.220 --> 30:55.810
I was outside the whole time.
Didn't see anyone come or go.

31:00.610 --> 31:01.480
Um...

31:04.190 --> 31:05.690
The money is long gone.

31:05.730 --> 31:07.150
So is the kidnapper.

31:11.700 --> 31:13.580
[Mal] Robin's back at the
hospital being checked out.

31:13.620 --> 31:15.160
How is this possible?

31:15.200 --> 31:16.790
It doesn't make any sense.

31:16.830 --> 31:18.500
I mean, both her
and the mainland

31:18.540 --> 31:20.080
medical examiner guy, Eagleton--

31:20.120 --> 31:22.080
They said that the
body parts were Robin's.

31:22.130 --> 31:23.420
Well, that's not the
only thing.

31:23.460 --> 31:25.550
The GPS transmitter
is broadcasting

31:25.590 --> 31:26.920
from the Police Station.

31:28.380 --> 31:31.430
Who else would have a bunch of
body parts lying around?

31:31.470 --> 31:32.970
Someone who works in
the morgue?

31:34.510 --> 31:38.850
We know it's not Jessica. Come
to think of it-- Eagleson.

31:38.890 --> 31:41.190
He's the one who actually ran
the DNA tests. Not Jessica.

31:41.230 --> 31:42.730
[Des] That makes sense.

31:42.770 --> 31:44.730
Anyone on the force will have
access to the police files.

31:44.770 --> 31:46.980
And the speculation that
Felicity had robbed a bank.

31:47.030 --> 31:49.360
Check into Eagleson. Find out
where he's been staying.

31:49.400 --> 31:50.530
Yeah. Will do.

31:55.700 --> 31:57.910
Jake. Please.
No more surprises.

31:57.950 --> 31:59.250
What's wrong?

31:59.290 --> 32:01.790
Where's buddy, buddy--
What's his name? Eagleson.

32:01.830 --> 32:03.170
You're jealous, aren't you?

32:03.210 --> 32:05.420
No. Well, actually
I was at one point.

32:05.460 --> 32:07.050
But I'm not anymore.

32:08.880 --> 32:10.720
We find the missing girl.
We found Robin.

32:10.760 --> 32:12.720
The kidnapped girl?
My God, is she okay?

32:12.760 --> 32:16.810
She's okay. Guess what? She
has both feet and both ears.

32:16.850 --> 32:17.100
Ears?

32:18.680 --> 32:21.350
Where did Eagleson get the DNA
to match the foot to Robin?

32:22.650 --> 32:24.940
DNA? I don't know. He
said you gave it to him.

32:24.980 --> 32:26.820
I knew it. Eagleson.

32:27.900 --> 32:30.280
He had access to
all the information

32:30.320 --> 32:31.950
on the case that
we were working.

32:41.040 --> 32:42.170
Son of a --

32:42.750 --> 32:44.120
Are you sure?

32:44.170 --> 32:46.420
Run a check on all your
cadavers, your dead bodies.

32:46.460 --> 32:49.960
I guarantee you, one of them's
missing a foot and an ear.

32:50.010 --> 32:51.130
What ear?

32:52.430 --> 32:53.090
Jake?

32:53.680 --> 32:55.090
Where's Felicity?

32:55.140 --> 32:57.510
We let her go. We didn't have
any evidence to hold her.

32:57.560 --> 32:58.680
What's going on?

32:58.720 --> 33:00.430
Good question.

33:03.230 --> 33:06.230
If Eagleson's got the money.
Why would he go after Felicity?

33:06.270 --> 33:07.480
They have nothing to do
with each other.

33:07.520 --> 33:08.690
Maybe they do.

33:09.980 --> 33:11.740
Murdoch was kicked
off the force because

33:11.780 --> 33:13.700
they suspected he
was Felicity’s partner.

33:13.740 --> 33:16.820
Felicity had inside information
that only a cop would know.

33:16.870 --> 33:19.370
Or someone who works
at the Police Station.

33:20.700 --> 33:25.250
Eagleson. Eagleson must
be Felicity's partner.

33:25.290 --> 33:26.460
Felicity cuts him out of his

33:26.500 --> 33:27.710
share of the money
and runs here.

33:27.750 --> 33:29.500
[ring]

33:29.550 --> 33:30.710
Des, what do you got?

33:30.750 --> 33:31.050
So, I did what you asked.

33:32.300 --> 33:33.510
I looked into where Eagleson's
been staying

33:34.180 --> 33:35.260
Anywhere remote?

33:35.300 --> 33:36.590
A hotel downtown.

33:36.640 --> 33:37.800
No, there's too many
people around.

33:37.840 --> 33:38.640
He could never kidnap
someone there.

33:38.680 --> 33:40.180
Yeah, that's what I thought.

33:40.220 --> 33:42.720
So, I looked into any relatives
he might have in the area.

33:42.770 --> 33:46.600
Turns out he has an uncle who
owns a cabin out in Middle Cove.

33:46.650 --> 33:48.560
That must be it.
Good job, Des.

33:48.610 --> 33:50.940
So this means you're good
about me dating Tinny.

33:53.150 --> 33:55.610
Yes. But don't tell anyone
I said that.

33:55.650 --> 33:58.280
And call Murdoch and tell him
to meet us there. Right away.

33:58.320 --> 33:59.330
Okay.

34:12.460 --> 34:14.090
There he is.

34:14.880 --> 34:16.970
Well, You see anything?

34:17.010 --> 34:18.090
Cabin's back there.

34:18.140 --> 34:19.010
I checked it. They're
not in there.

34:20.100 --> 34:21.350
I'm worried that Eagleson's
got her.

34:21.390 --> 34:23.430
Eagleson [in the distance]
No!

34:23.470 --> 34:24.430
Felicity!

34:25.810 --> 34:26.690
Felicity.

34:29.230 --> 34:31.020
Okay. This is not
what I expected.

34:31.070 --> 34:32.230
Tell me about it.

34:32.270 --> 34:34.820
Back off. Everyone back off,
or he's dead.

34:34.860 --> 34:37.820
Felicity. Why are you doing
this? Put the knife down.

34:37.860 --> 34:38.910
He kidnapped my cousin.

34:38.950 --> 34:40.910
He's never gonna stop
coming after me.

34:40.950 --> 34:41.660
This is the only way.

34:41.700 --> 34:43.080
Because you cut me out.

34:43.120 --> 34:44.830
Give me half the money
and you'll never see me again.

34:44.870 --> 34:47.710
Buddy, you're not in the best
bargaining position here.

34:47.750 --> 34:51.880
Felicity. Okay. It's cold out,
and we wanna go home. Okay.

34:51.920 --> 34:55.420
So can you please,
please not be at this.

34:55.460 --> 34:57.380
Maybe I wanna be at it.

34:58.260 --> 34:59.550
Put down the knife.

35:00.220 --> 35:00.890
Billy please.

35:01.760 --> 35:02.930
You're never gonna shoot me.

35:02.970 --> 35:04.310
We both know it. So why
don't you just--

35:04.350 --> 35:05.220
[bang]

35:07.270 --> 35:08.140
The money!

35:17.610 --> 35:21.240
Okay! Let go of the bag and
give me your other hand.

35:21.280 --> 35:23.410
No!
I'll lose the money.

35:23.450 --> 35:24.990
If you don't let go of the bag,

35:25.030 --> 35:27.250
you're gonna lose a lot
more than that. Now come on!

35:29.830 --> 35:30.790
Give us your hand.

35:30.830 --> 35:31.920
Okay!

35:35.000 --> 35:35.880
No!

35:42.090 --> 35:43.760
No, the money!

35:43.800 --> 35:46.220
Give me your other hand.
Come on.

35:53.020 --> 35:53.900
You okay?

35:54.570 --> 35:55.610
Yeah.

35:58.440 --> 35:59.320
Come on, Dad.

36:02.280 --> 36:03.240
Billy.

36:03.780 --> 36:05.030
You shot me.

36:05.950 --> 36:07.080
I can't believe you did that.

36:07.830 --> 36:09.160
You were gonna kill him.

36:09.200 --> 36:12.290
You didn't exactly
leave me any choice.

36:12.330 --> 36:14.420
Why'd you do it, Felicity?

36:14.460 --> 36:17.090
You ruined everything that
I believed in for you.

36:17.130 --> 36:19.050
You know what? I never asked
you to do that, Billy.

36:20.220 --> 36:23.970
I'm just not the woman
you think I am.

36:24.010 --> 36:25.550
[sirens]

36:25.600 --> 36:27.010
I never was.

36:28.020 --> 36:29.600
I'm starting to realize that.

36:31.560 --> 36:35.270
Well, you'll never have to see
me again, Felicity.

36:37.270 --> 36:38.650
I'm sorry, Billy.

36:50.120 --> 36:51.210
You okay there, Pally?

36:52.250 --> 36:54.830
About as good as can
be expected?

36:55.750 --> 36:57.920
Thank you again,
Mr. Doyle.

36:57.960 --> 37:00.130
I needed closure.
I owe you one.

37:01.380 --> 37:02.430
Nudding to it.

37:05.930 --> 37:07.890
If you have a love,
and they love

37:07.930 --> 37:10.850
you in return, cherish that.

37:11.430 --> 37:13.060
Take it from me.

37:14.060 --> 37:14.940
Yeah.

37:17.900 --> 37:21.360
Is it just me? Or does it feel
like we've done this before?

37:22.070 --> 37:23.320
I don't know.

37:23.360 --> 37:25.740
Maybe it all happened
in another life, hey b'y?

37:36.920 --> 37:38.670
You know, if I wasn't
so overworked

37:38.710 --> 37:40.590
and understaffed,
I'd be mad at ya.

37:40.630 --> 37:43.760
Oh yeah. I mean, I only
solved a bank robbery

37:43.800 --> 37:45.380
and took down both the culprits.

37:45.430 --> 37:47.180
Obviously, I'm a huge jerk.

37:47.220 --> 37:48.760
Some wouldn't
disagree with that.

37:48.800 --> 37:51.720
Oh, and I solved
a kidnapping, too.

37:51.770 --> 37:53.480
I thought you said
Robin was missing.

37:55.310 --> 37:57.020
Well, technically missing--

37:58.150 --> 38:01.690
Kidnapping--It's a
subset of missing.

38:01.730 --> 38:03.780
You know the whole Venn
diagram thing.

38:04.650 --> 38:07.110
Oh right. That's brilliant.

38:07.160 --> 38:10.370
You know, I should hire
you in the Department.

38:11.410 --> 38:12.500
I got that kind of
authority now.

38:13.660 --> 38:16.210
So I heard. Congratulations,
Inspector.

38:16.250 --> 38:17.460
You know, that's very,

38:20.380 --> 38:22.590
very sexy.

38:29.180 --> 38:29.930
[Jess]
Jake.

38:30.760 --> 38:34.140
Hey. I'm not interrupting.

38:35.430 --> 38:38.770
No. Jake and I were just
talking business.

38:40.230 --> 38:41.690
[ring]

38:41.730 --> 38:45.360
Thank God. I mean, I have to
take this. It's my daughter.

38:47.240 --> 38:50.120
Hi. Hold on for a second.

38:55.080 --> 38:57.670
I'll call you--

38:58.250 --> 39:02.550
both anon.

39:15.640 --> 39:16.810
Mmmm.

39:23.730 --> 39:26.610
If you weren't so cute,
I'd be mad at you.

39:26.650 --> 39:29.150
Sorry.

39:29.200 --> 39:32.200
It's fine. Mom says hi.

39:32.240 --> 39:34.490
Oh. Be sure to send
her my love.

39:37.290 --> 39:39.210
You know, we went out to that
lighthouse in Ferryland.

39:39.250 --> 39:40.960
And I coulda sworn she
was casing the joint.

39:41.960 --> 39:43.670
Wow. What a score
that would be.

39:43.710 --> 39:45.380
Yeah.

39:53.590 --> 39:56.850
Well, would you look at this.
She's doing her homework.

40:04.650 --> 40:06.360
Are we okay? Or--

40:08.230 --> 40:10.240
Yeah, I'm sorry I
hung up on you.

40:13.030 --> 40:13.910
It's all right.

40:17.290 --> 40:22.920
Look, Sloan. You and me.
I'm new at being a father.

40:23.960 --> 40:25.340
You're new at being
a daughter.

40:26.500 --> 40:28.260
So what do you say?
Let's make a deal.

40:29.670 --> 40:32.220
Let's not put too much
pressure on ourselves.

40:35.470 --> 40:36.640
I'll drink to that.

40:37.140 --> 40:38.600
Ha. Ha.

40:39.100 --> 40:39.270
Joking.

40:40.600 --> 40:43.520
Now ,I realize you have
a cash flow situation.

40:43.560 --> 40:45.230
To be honest with you, it
won't be long before

40:45.270 --> 40:46.520
Father has you working here.

40:46.570 --> 40:48.110
So, to avoid that--

40:51.950 --> 40:52.860
I have a plan.

40:53.570 --> 40:54.450
What are you doing?

40:55.490 --> 40:56.370
You'll see.

41:05.500 --> 41:06.380
Now.

41:08.880 --> 41:11.420
This is lot of money for
someone your age,

41:12.010 --> 41:15.140
Sloan Daniels.

41:16.970 --> 41:18.470
I wanna know exactly

41:18.510 --> 41:22.430
what you plan to do with
it. In writing.

41:27.520 --> 41:28.900
Now,

41:28.940 --> 41:30.860
it's gonna go towards
your first year of university.

41:30.900 --> 41:32.570
And yes, you will be going
to university.

41:32.610 --> 41:38.450
But I think you can use some of
it until you get to that stage.

41:39.780 --> 41:41.910
I don't know what to say.

41:46.460 --> 41:47.000
Come on.

41:48.340 --> 41:50.250
Let's go to father's house
and get some supper.

41:51.460 --> 41:53.260
Can I just meet up
with you in--

41:53.300 --> 41:54.130
just a minute.

41:55.590 --> 41:57.930
I got some stuff to do
downstairs, so don't be long.

42:38.470 --> 42:39.260
[Jake] What are
you doing?

42:39.850 --> 42:41.010
Are you okay?

42:41.760 --> 42:44.890
Yeah. Great.

42:51.480 --> 42:52.360
Alright.
