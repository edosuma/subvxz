WEBVTT

00:03.537 --> 00:05.306
DOES ANYBODY RECOGNIZE THIS?
IS THERE ANYTHING
ON THE BACK?

00:05.339 --> 00:06.440
YEAH. NUMBER ONE.

00:06.474 --> 00:08.409
( tires screech )
( thud )

00:08.442 --> 00:09.543
THAT'S "A's" CELL PHONE.

00:09.577 --> 00:11.312
SPENCE,
YOUR SISTER'S "A."

00:11.345 --> 00:12.746
IT'S BEEN
MELISSA ALL ALONG.

00:12.780 --> 00:14.282
WHAT WERE YOU DOING
IN ALISON'S BEDROOM?

00:14.315 --> 00:15.683
I'D BE CAREFUL, SPENCE.

00:15.716 --> 00:18.119
I GOT FIRED TODAY.
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

00:18.152 --> 00:20.221
PROBABLY HEAD UP TO MY
FOLKS' PLACE, FOR A WHILE.

00:20.254 --> 00:22.056
WHEN WILL YOU BE BACK?

00:22.090 --> 00:24.425
IF I CAN'T TEACH
IN THIS TOWN, WHAT'S LEFT?

00:24.458 --> 00:26.327
MAYA AND I GOT IN
A FIGHT THE OTHER
NIGHT AT THE PARTY,

00:26.360 --> 00:27.528
AND I HAVEN'T
TALKED TO HER SINCE.

00:29.197 --> 00:30.564
I'VE BEEN THINKING
A LOT ABOUT US.

00:30.598 --> 00:32.266
IT'S A LITTLE LATE
FOR THAT, ISN'T IT?

00:32.299 --> 00:33.634
HOW DO YOU HAVE THIS?

00:33.667 --> 00:35.136
GARRETT ASKED ME TO
KEEP IT SAFE FOR HIM,

00:35.169 --> 00:36.470
BUT I THINK THE POLICE
SHOULD HAVE IT.

00:36.504 --> 00:38.339
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST.
FOR WHAT?

00:38.372 --> 00:40.174
THE MURDER OF
ALISON DiLAURENTIS.

00:45.346 --> 00:47.381
Newscaster: ONE WEEK
 AFTER HIS ARREST,

00:47.415 --> 00:49.217
REYNOLDS PLED NOT GUILTY
 TO THE CHARGE

00:49.250 --> 00:51.285
OF ALISON DiLAURENTIS'
 MURDER.

00:51.319 --> 00:54.488
HOWEVER, PROSECUTORS
 REMAIN CONFIDENT
 WITH THEIR CASE.

00:54.522 --> 00:56.490
ROSEWOOD P.D.'s
 WORKING THEORY

00:56.524 --> 00:58.759
IS THAT REYNOLDS
 BECAME A POLICE OFFICER

00:58.792 --> 01:01.762
TO DESTROY EVIDENCE
 THAT LINKED HIM TO
 THE MURDER SCENE.

01:01.795 --> 01:04.432
INVESTIGATORS RECEIVED
 A BREAK IN THE CASE

01:04.465 --> 01:07.368
WHEN THAT DOCUMENT
 WAS RECOVERED.

01:07.401 --> 01:09.770
THAT MUST BE PAGE 5
OF ALI'S AUTOPSY REPORT.

01:09.803 --> 01:12.440
GARRETT TOOK IT,
BUT SOMEBODY GAVE IT BACK.

01:12.473 --> 01:14.275
MY MOM IS FRIENDS
WITH THE PROSECUTOR.

01:14.308 --> 01:16.677
THAT SOMEBODY... WAS JENNA.

01:16.710 --> 01:20.248
CAN WE FINALLY
PUT ALI TO REST NOW?

01:20.281 --> 01:21.649
...HIS PARENTS STILL LIVING.

01:21.682 --> 01:23.351
OR IS TWO DOWN
AND TWO TO GO?

01:23.384 --> 01:26.287
IAN'S DEAD,
GARRETT'S IN JAIL.

01:26.320 --> 01:29.323
MELISSA AND JENNA
WERE IN ALI'S ROOM
THAT NIGHT TOO.

01:29.357 --> 01:30.824
THEY MAY NOT HAVE KILLED ALI,

01:30.858 --> 01:33.294
BUT THEY'RE DEFINITELY
GUILTY OF SOMETHING.

01:33.327 --> 01:35.163
( approaching footsteps )

01:35.196 --> 01:37.198
LOVE GONE WRONG.

01:39.233 --> 01:40.434
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

01:40.468 --> 01:42.770
I KNEW IAN
DIDN'T KILL ALISON,

01:42.803 --> 01:44.605
AND YOU FOUR
CAN KEEP A SECRET,

01:44.638 --> 01:46.874
BUT YOU DON'T HAVE
THE CONSTITUTION
FOR MURDER.

01:48.942 --> 01:50.311
ARE YOU GONNA EAT THAT?

01:55.949 --> 01:57.351
THANKS.

01:58.819 --> 02:01.289
I KNOW HOW
JENNA MARSHALL WENT BLIND,

02:01.322 --> 02:04.225
AND SO DID GARRETT.
IF HE KILLED ALISON,

02:04.258 --> 02:06.260
IT'S BECAUSE HE THOUGHT
SHE DESERVED IT.

02:08.562 --> 02:09.630
MMM.

02:11.832 --> 02:13.667
IS THIS PEANUT BUTTER?

02:13.701 --> 02:15.603
TOFFEE.

02:15.636 --> 02:17.571
MM. IT IS GOOD.

02:18.772 --> 02:20.608
THANKS.

02:28.216 --> 02:30.351
SHE DEFINITELY KNOWS
ABOUT THE JENNA THING.

02:30.384 --> 02:32.320
( cell phones ringing
and plinking )

02:34.322 --> 02:37.191
"YOU STILL HAVE SOMETHING
THAT BELONGS TO ME.

02:37.225 --> 02:39.493
"BRING IT, OR ONE OF YOU
LEAVES IN A BODY BAG.

02:39.527 --> 02:40.628
'A.'"

02:40.661 --> 02:42.230
( doorbell rings )

02:44.432 --> 02:45.966
"A" HAS TO BE TALKING
ABOUT HER PHONE.

02:45.999 --> 02:48.236
YOU STILL HAVE IT LOCKED
IN YOUR CLOSET, RIGHT?

02:48.269 --> 02:49.370
YES.

02:49.403 --> 02:50.638
I DON'T KNOW
ABOUT YOU GUYS,

02:50.671 --> 02:51.905
BUT "A" TALKING
ABOUT BODY BAGS

02:51.939 --> 02:53.374
MAKES ME VERY NERVOUS.

02:54.608 --> 02:58.212
GUYS, IT WAS A MESSENGER.

02:58.246 --> 02:59.913
SOMETHING FOR EACH OF US.

03:07.721 --> 03:09.457
"A" WANTS TO PLAY
HIDE-AND-SEEK.

03:11.459 --> 03:13.561
"BE THERE WHEN THE CLOCK
STRIKES MIDNIGHT."

03:20.534 --> 03:21.602
SPENCE?

03:24.538 --> 03:27.508
HIDE-AND-SEEK WAS
MY FAVORITE GAME
WITH MELISSA.

03:29.677 --> 03:31.211
YOU WANNA KNOW WHY?

03:34.648 --> 03:35.949
I ALWAYS WON.

03:40.688 --> 03:41.822
* GOT A SECRET

03:41.855 --> 03:43.357
* CAN YOU KEEP IT?

03:43.391 --> 03:45.726
* SWEAR THIS ONE
 YOU'LL SAVE *

03:45.759 --> 03:47.695
* BETTER LOCK IT
 IN YOUR POCKET *

03:47.728 --> 03:50.864
* TAKING THIS ONE
 TO THE GRAVE *

03:50.898 --> 03:53.267
* IF I SHOW YOU
 THEN I KNOW YOU *

03:53.301 --> 03:55.603
* WON'T TELL WHAT I SAID

03:55.636 --> 03:58.306
* 'CAUSE TWO
 CAN KEEP A SECRET *

03:58.339 --> 04:00.774
* IF ONE OF THEM IS DEAD

04:03.511 --> 04:06.013
SHE WAS IN THAT KITCHEN
EATING FROZEN YOGURT,

04:06.046 --> 04:08.282
BASICALLY JUST TELLING US
THAT SHE WAS "A."

04:08.316 --> 04:10.284
AND NOW SHE WANTS
TO KILL ONE OF US.

04:10.318 --> 04:13.053
PARTIES AND BODY BAGS
GO TOGETHER LIKE
DRINKING AND DRIVING.

04:13.086 --> 04:15.489
GUYS, I DON'T TRUST
MELISSA AS FAR AS I CAN
THROW HER AND IAN'S FETUS,

04:15.523 --> 04:17.791
BUT LET'S NOT FORGET
THAT JENNA ALSO KNOWS
ABOUT THE JENNA THING.

04:17.825 --> 04:20.594
IAN'S FETUS?
EM, THAT'S DISGUSTING.

04:20.628 --> 04:21.728
LOOK, "A" IS
ALL-KNOWING, ALL RIGHT?

04:21.762 --> 04:23.864
IT'S LIKE A GENIUS
ON STEROIDS.

04:23.897 --> 04:25.699
THE ONLY PERSON I KNOW
THAT'S SMARTER THAN SPENCER

04:25.733 --> 04:26.867
IS HER SISTER.

04:26.900 --> 04:29.002
UM, I TAKE OFFENSE.

04:29.036 --> 04:31.939
MELISSA DID SCORE HIGHER
ON THE WECHSLER SCALE,

04:31.972 --> 04:33.574
BUT WHEN YOU TAKE
INTO ACCOUNT MY SCORES

04:33.607 --> 04:34.908
AND THE FLYNN EFFECT,

04:34.942 --> 04:36.577
COMBINED WITH REAL-LIFE
ACCOMPLISHMENTS,

04:36.610 --> 04:38.579
THE GAP IN OUR I.Q.s
IS VIRTUALLY NONEXISTENT.

04:38.612 --> 04:41.815
UM... WHAT ARE YOU DOING
WITH ALI'S BAG?

04:41.849 --> 04:44.485
I'M GIVING "A"
BACK HER PHONE
OVER MY DEAD BODY,

04:44.518 --> 04:46.019
WHICH MEANS THAT WE HAVE
UNTIL MIDNIGHT TOMORROW

04:46.053 --> 04:47.888
TO UNMASK THIS BITCH
ONCE AND FOR ALL,

04:47.921 --> 04:49.323
AND THIS BAG HAS BROUGHT US
CLOSER TO THE TRUTH

04:49.357 --> 04:50.724
THAN WE'VE EVER GOTTEN.

04:50.758 --> 04:52.393
YOU THINK THERE'S SOMETHING
IN THERE WE MISSED?

04:52.426 --> 04:54.328
WE NEED TO GO THROUGH IT
AGAIN, ALL OF US,

04:54.362 --> 04:55.863
WITH A FRESH PAIR OF EYES.

04:55.896 --> 04:57.798
BUT WITH
MELISSA AT HOME, I...

04:57.831 --> 04:59.099
NO, FORGET MY PLACE.

04:59.132 --> 05:01.068
MY MOM IS STILL HOT
ON THE "A" TRAIL.

05:01.101 --> 05:03.337
LOOK, LET'S JUST MEET
AFTER SCHOOL.

05:03.371 --> 05:06.907
I HAVE AN IDEA
FOR A GREAT COSTUME.

05:06.940 --> 05:09.076
OH, YOU'RE GOING TO
THE MASQUERADE MASH?

05:09.109 --> 05:12.946
ME TOO. CAN YOU BELIEVE
BLIND JENNA'S GOING?

05:12.980 --> 05:15.015
A WEEK AGO, THAT WOULD
HAVE MADE ME A NO-SHOW,

05:15.048 --> 05:16.617
BUT SINCE SHE DUMPED
NOEL CON MAN

05:16.650 --> 05:18.452
FOR SEEING-EYE TOBY--

05:18.486 --> 05:19.987
SORRY, SPENCER.

05:20.020 --> 05:23.457
( speaking French )

05:23.491 --> 05:26.994
I LOVE THIS VINTAGE SHOP
A FEW TOWNS OVER.

05:27.027 --> 05:29.663
WE SHOULD ALL GO AFTER SCHOOL
AND GET OUR COSTUMES TOGETHER!

05:29.697 --> 05:31.899
I WOULD LOVE TO, BUT, UM,

05:31.932 --> 05:34.568
I HAVE TO TAKE MY SISTER
TO AN ULTRASOUND.

05:34.602 --> 05:35.869
MY MOM'S COMING BACK
TOMORROW,

05:35.903 --> 05:37.371
SO I HAVE SOME HOUSE STUFF.

05:37.405 --> 05:39.540
YEAH, AND VINTAGE
IS MY MIDDLE NAME,

05:39.573 --> 05:41.375
BUT..
( school bell rings )

05:41.409 --> 05:43.911
I GOTTA GET TO CLASS.

05:43.944 --> 05:46.380
THAT LEAVES US.

05:46.414 --> 05:48.048
UM... ( sighs )

05:48.081 --> 05:49.650
LOOK, I AM SO SORRY, MONA,

05:49.683 --> 05:52.786
BUT I HAVE TO STUDY
WITH CALEB AFTER SCHOOL.

05:52.820 --> 05:55.823
SO IT'S JUST ME... AGAIN.

05:58.992 --> 06:00.828
TRISTAN AND ISOLDE?

06:00.861 --> 06:02.396
ABELARD AND ELOISE?

06:04.865 --> 06:06.500
THIS IS TOO CUTE.

06:08.636 --> 06:11.672
FITZ IS A SUCKER
FOR A TRAGIC LOVE STORY.

06:13.006 --> 06:15.409
I SO DIDN'T MEAN THAT
HOW IT SOUNDED.

06:15.443 --> 06:17.144
HAVE YOU HEARD FROM HIM?

06:17.177 --> 06:18.446
YEAH, HE CHECKS IN.

06:19.913 --> 06:21.482
EVERYTHING
HE THOUGHT HE WANTED,

06:21.515 --> 06:22.850
HE'S LOST BECAUSE OF ME.

06:24.518 --> 06:26.620
( sighs ) GUYS,
I-I THINK THAT

06:26.654 --> 06:28.756
IT MIGHT BE
OVER THIS TIME.

06:28.789 --> 06:29.990
REALLY OVER.

06:33.093 --> 06:35.829
( cell phone plinks )

06:35.863 --> 06:37.164
GREAT.

06:37.197 --> 06:39.967
NOW MONA KNOWS I LIED
ABOUT WHERE I AM.

06:40.000 --> 06:42.470
( telephone rings )
AND CALEB IS WITH HER...

06:42.503 --> 06:44.572
SO HE'S GONNA ASK ME
WHY I DITCHED HER.

06:44.605 --> 06:46.974
YOU KNOW, I AM LYING
TO EVERYONE I CARE ABOUT.

06:47.007 --> 06:49.042
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHY I STARTED LYING
TO BEGIN WITH.

06:49.076 --> 06:51.879
YOU'RE LYING BECAUSE
YOU DON'T WANT THE PEOPLE
THAT YOU CARE ABOUT

06:51.912 --> 06:53.581
TO END UP
LIKE DR. SULLIVAN--

06:53.614 --> 06:55.949
HERE ONE DAY
AND GONE THE NEXT.

06:58.018 --> 06:59.453
HANNA, DO YOU MIND?

06:59.487 --> 07:02.823
IT'S... KIND OF
SACRED GROUND.

07:02.856 --> 07:04.458
All: IT IS?

07:07.127 --> 07:10.564
MAN! YOU SURE CAN
KEEP A SECRET.

07:13.667 --> 07:17.004
HEY, EM, CAN YOU
GRAB MY COMPUTER?

07:17.037 --> 07:18.506
WHAT IS IT, SPENCE?

07:18.539 --> 07:22.576
COULD YOU LOOK UP
DOUGHERTY'S LANDING?

07:28.849 --> 07:30.984
IT'S A TINY AIRSTRIP
OFF OF HIGHWAY 30.

07:31.018 --> 07:32.653
IS IT CLOSE TO ANYTHING?

07:32.686 --> 07:34.622
NO, IT'S IN THE MIDDLE
OF NOWHERE.

07:37.725 --> 07:40.628
WAIT... WHAT DID THAT
POSTCARD SAY?

07:40.661 --> 07:42.129
UM... "MEETS 30."

07:48.602 --> 07:50.270
"THE LOST WOODS RESORT.

07:50.303 --> 07:52.940
FIND US WHERE GREENVIEW
MEETS 30."

07:52.973 --> 07:55.543
DUNCAN SAID THAT HE FLEW
ALI TO AN AIRFIELD

07:55.576 --> 07:56.944
THE DAY SHE DISAPPEARED.

07:56.977 --> 07:58.679
THIS HAS TO BE
WHERE SHE WENT.

07:58.712 --> 08:00.881
( sighs )

08:00.914 --> 08:02.850
MAYBE ROOM ONE?

08:09.890 --> 08:12.660
Em: ARE YOU SURE
THIS IS RIGHT?

08:12.693 --> 08:14.027
Spencer:
THIS IS GREENVIEW.

08:21.569 --> 08:23.637
( tires squeal )

08:23.671 --> 08:24.838
WHAT WAS THAT?

08:24.872 --> 08:28.108
I-I DON'T KNOW.
A DEER, I THINK.

08:28.141 --> 08:29.777
MAYBE WE SHOULD GO BACK.

08:29.810 --> 08:32.111
NO! OKAY, WE DIDN'T
COME THIS FAR TO GIVE UP.

08:32.145 --> 08:34.246
CAREFUL, SPENCE.

08:43.155 --> 08:44.592
WHAT IS THAT?

08:52.332 --> 08:55.068
WHAT WOULD ALI
BE DOING UP HERE?

08:55.102 --> 08:57.771
SHE WASN'T BAGGING A DEER,
THAT'S FOR SURE.

09:15.155 --> 09:16.824
( knock on window )
( all gasp )

09:16.857 --> 09:19.059
ARE YOU CHECKING IN?

09:23.897 --> 09:26.734
I WAS SURPRISED
WHEN YOU GIRLS TURNED UP.

09:26.767 --> 09:28.235
PEOPLE DON'T COME HERE
MUCH ANYMORE

09:28.268 --> 09:29.937
SINCE THEY
BUILT THE INTERSTATE.

09:32.139 --> 09:33.741
IT DOESN'T BOTHER ME,
THOUGH.

09:35.208 --> 09:36.276
I LIKE THE QUIET.

09:38.679 --> 09:39.747
SIGN HERE.

09:45.285 --> 09:47.721
WELCOME TO THE LOST
WOODS RESORT...

09:49.022 --> 09:51.324
MARY SMITH.

09:52.425 --> 09:54.795
UM, IS ROOM ONE AVAILABLE?

09:55.963 --> 09:57.631
HOW'D YOU KNOW
ABOUT ROOM ONE?

09:58.966 --> 10:01.034
SORRY?

10:01.068 --> 10:03.671
IT'S GOT THE HOTTEST
WATER ON THE PROPERTY.

10:03.704 --> 10:05.205
IT'S PERFECT
FOR A NIGHT LIKE THIS.

10:05.238 --> 10:07.808
OH, O-OUR FRIEND,
THE ONE WHO TOLD US
ABOUT THIS PLACE,

10:07.841 --> 10:09.176
SHE STAYED IN ROOM ONE.

10:09.209 --> 10:10.978
MAYBE YOU REMEMBER HER--

10:11.011 --> 10:12.245
VIVIAN DARKBLOOM?

10:14.181 --> 10:16.283
NAME DOESN'T RING A BELL.

10:16.316 --> 10:17.918
BESIDES, I LEARNED
A LONG TIME AGO

10:17.951 --> 10:20.754
NOT TO TELL TALES
ABOUT FOLKS WHO STAY HERE.

10:20.788 --> 10:23.724
YOU CHECK INTO THE LOST
WOODS BECAUSE YOU DON'T
WANT TO BE FOUND.

10:37.204 --> 10:39.740
UNH! DAMN IT!

10:39.773 --> 10:42.109
ARE YOU OKAY?

10:42.142 --> 10:43.210
HANNA, COME ON!

10:54.788 --> 10:58.892
I'M... NOT EXACTLY SURE
WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR.

10:58.926 --> 11:02.295
ALI LEFT IAN TO COME
UP HERE FOR A REASON.

11:02.329 --> 11:03.997
WHAT WAS IT?

11:13.306 --> 11:15.442
LOVE HOW THEY CALL
THIS PLACE A RESORT.

11:19.847 --> 11:22.182
DO YOU THINK THAT ALI
CAME HERE TO HIDE SOMETHING?

11:24.151 --> 11:26.353
OR DO YOU THINK THAT
SHE CAME HERE TO HIDE,

11:26.386 --> 11:27.454
FROM "A"?

11:29.156 --> 11:31.058
WE NEED TO GET
INTO THE OFFICE.

11:32.826 --> 11:33.961
WAS ALI HERE ALONE,

11:33.994 --> 11:36.396
OR DID SHE COME
WITH SOMEBODY?

11:36.429 --> 11:39.132
IS HE STILL THERE?

11:39.166 --> 11:41.368
I THINK THAT HE LEFT.

11:41.401 --> 11:43.837
I'M JUST DYING TO GET A LOOK
AT THAT REGISTRATION BOOK.

11:50.443 --> 11:54.948
WAIT, REALLY?
YOU'RE GONNA COME WITH ME?

11:56.383 --> 11:58.018
DOES IT LOOK LIKE
THOSE TWO ARE MOVING?

11:58.051 --> 11:59.887
I'M COLD.

11:59.920 --> 12:02.055
OKAY, NO,
I'M COLDER THAN SHE IS.

12:05.859 --> 12:07.928
YOU'RE LITTLE,
BUT YOU'RE BIG.

12:26.546 --> 12:29.549
IS IT JUST ME,
OR IS SHE STARING AT US?

12:29.582 --> 12:31.384
COME ON.

12:37.124 --> 12:39.893
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU'RE TAKING A SHOWER
IN THIS PLACE.

12:39.927 --> 12:42.462
IT'S GROSS.
GOD, EMILY,
I'M COVERED IN MUD.

12:42.495 --> 12:44.131
( sighs )

12:44.164 --> 12:46.766
( cell phone rings )

12:48.235 --> 12:49.870
( rings )

12:52.105 --> 12:53.874
HELLO? MAYA?

12:54.975 --> 12:57.044
CAN YOU HEAR ME?

13:32.479 --> 13:35.148
ALI CHECKED INTO ROOM ONE
AS VIVIAN DARKBLOOM

13:35.182 --> 13:37.017
THE MORNING BEFORE
SHE WENT MISSING.

13:40.220 --> 13:42.522
ARE-- ARE THERE ANY OTHER
NAMES IN HERE THAT WE KNOW?

13:42.555 --> 13:44.925
UH...

14:15.455 --> 14:18.158
( cell phone rings )

14:20.093 --> 14:21.294
( ring )

14:24.364 --> 14:25.598
( ring )

14:28.969 --> 14:30.904
( ring )
EMILY?

14:52.025 --> 14:53.994
ALI STAYED HERE TWICE,

14:54.027 --> 14:55.462
AND THE FIRST TIME
WAS THE DAY

14:55.495 --> 14:57.464
SHE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE
MEETING "A" IN BROOKHAVEN.

14:57.497 --> 15:00.233
COINCIDENCE?
I DOUBT IT.

15:04.737 --> 15:06.373
Hanna: SERIOUSLY?

15:08.341 --> 15:10.377
SHE STILL DIDN'T CALL BACK?

15:10.410 --> 15:12.980
MY MOM'S NOT EVEN HOME YET,
AND I'M LYING TO HER.

15:13.013 --> 15:14.681
SHE THINKS I'M
STAYING AT YOUR HOUSE.

15:14.714 --> 15:17.684
OH, THAT WORKS,
'CAUSE MY MOM THINKS
THAT I STAYED AT YOURS.

15:17.717 --> 15:21.221
WE'RE NOT STEALING THAT,
ARE WE?

15:21.254 --> 15:23.390
NO. WE'LL GO PUT IT BACK.

15:23.423 --> 15:24.624
WE?

15:24.657 --> 15:26.159
SPENCER, YOU ARE NOT
GONNA MAKE ME

15:26.193 --> 15:27.494
CRAWL THROUGH THAT
WINDOW AGAIN, ARE YOU?

15:27.527 --> 15:29.429
I'LL DO IT, I JUST NEED
YOU TO STAND GUARD.

15:30.630 --> 15:33.233
COME ON,
WE'RE "TEAM SPARIA."

15:42.709 --> 15:44.511
WHAT'S WRONG?

15:44.544 --> 15:47.380
CALEB CAN'T TAKE ME TO
THE MASQUERADE PARTY ANYMORE.

15:47.414 --> 15:49.716
HIS MOM'S FLYING IN TONIGHT.

15:49.749 --> 15:51.985
MY COSTUME NEEDED A DATE.

15:52.019 --> 15:53.420
WHAT'S YOUR COSTUME?

15:53.453 --> 15:55.222
I WANTED TO BE JULIET,

15:55.255 --> 15:58.325
SINCE BRIDGET WOO
BEAT ME OUT FOR THE PART
IN THE 6th GRADE.

15:58.358 --> 16:02.029
LOOKING BACK,
I THINK I WANTED
TO BE ROMEO.

16:02.062 --> 16:04.464
SO, WILL YOU GO
TO THE PARTY WITH ME?

16:04.497 --> 16:05.632
I'LL BE YOUR DATE...

16:05.665 --> 16:07.334
BUT I'M NOT DRESSING
LIKE A DUDE.

16:07.367 --> 16:09.136
HAROLD'S BACK.

16:09.169 --> 16:11.371
LET'S GO BEFORE HE REALIZES
WE TOUCHED HIS STUFF!

16:30.057 --> 16:31.124
SPENCER.

16:34.727 --> 16:37.297
HAVE YOU HEARD ANYTHING?

16:37.330 --> 16:39.266
WHAT MIGHT HAVE
CAUSED THE FIRE?

16:41.368 --> 16:43.470
JUST THAT IT
WASN'T AN ACCIDENT.

16:43.503 --> 16:44.571
HOW IS JENNA?

16:47.774 --> 16:49.276
SHE SEEMS FINE.

16:52.112 --> 16:55.215
ARE YOU GONNA BE
BRINGING HER TO
THE MASQUERADE PARTY?

16:55.248 --> 16:56.316
NO.

16:58.418 --> 17:00.587
JENNA FOUND A WAY
TO FORGIVE ME.

17:02.689 --> 17:04.656
DO YOU THINK THAT YOU
WILL EVER BE ABLE TO?

17:09.561 --> 17:11.231
I HAVE WORK TO DO.

17:21.574 --> 17:24.444
LOOK, YOU HAVE EVERY
RIGHT TO HATE ME, OKAY,

17:24.477 --> 17:28.315
BUT YOU DON'T HAVE
TO BE THAT GUY.

17:28.348 --> 17:30.717
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE THE GUY
THAT WON'T LET ANYBODY IN.

17:36.523 --> 17:39.058
( cell phone rings )

17:45.232 --> 17:46.299
DR. SULLIVAN?

18:09.856 --> 18:10.723
( sighs )

18:14.494 --> 18:16.863
I'VE THOUGHT ABOUT
THIS MOMENT SO MANY TIMES,

18:16.896 --> 18:19.466
WONDERING WHAT I WOULD
SAY TO YOU IF I SAW
YOU AGAIN.

18:32.545 --> 18:34.214
THEY'RE ALL GONNA BE
AT THE PARTY.

18:35.682 --> 18:37.584
YOU KNOW
WHAT YOU NEED TO DO.

18:41.954 --> 18:46.893
Female Vocalist:
 * IT'S BEEN THE LONGEST
 WINTER WITHOUT YOU *

18:48.728 --> 18:52.732
* I DIDN'T KNOW WHERE
 TO TURN TO *

18:54.501 --> 18:57.437
* SEE, SOMEHOW
 I CAN'T FORGET YOU *

18:57.470 --> 19:00.573
THIS IS THE PERFECT
PLACE FOR "A" TO HIDE.

19:00.607 --> 19:02.842
WHERE WAS MELISSA
WHEN YOU LEFT?

19:02.875 --> 19:06.346
IN HER PAJAMAS,
CURLED UP ON THE COUCH.

19:06.379 --> 19:08.215
WE HAVE THREE HOURS
TO FIND OUT WHO "A" IS

19:08.248 --> 19:09.682
BEFORE "A" FINDS US.

19:09.716 --> 19:11.384
WE ALL STILL AGREE, RIGHT?

19:11.418 --> 19:13.286
NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS
AT MIDNIGHT,

19:13.320 --> 19:15.855
WE STICK TOGETHER,
AND WE ARE NOT
GIVING UP THAT PHONE.

19:15.888 --> 19:18.858
THAT'S FOUR AGAINST ONE.
I LIKE THOSE ODDS.

19:18.891 --> 19:20.627
SHOULD WE SPLIT UP
AND LOOK AROUND?

19:20.660 --> 19:23.430
NONE OF US HAVE DATES, SO...

19:23.463 --> 19:24.931
LET'S MEET BACK
HERE IN AN HOUR,

19:24.964 --> 19:26.733
AND KEEP
YOUR PHONES CLOSE.

19:29.936 --> 19:32.539
* THOUGHT I COULDN'T
 LIVE WITHOUT YOU *

19:32.572 --> 19:35.242
* IT'S GONNA HURT
 WHEN IT HEALS TOO *

19:35.275 --> 19:37.377
* OH, IT HURTS

19:37.410 --> 19:40.280
( song continues )

19:40.313 --> 19:42.582
( gasps )

19:42.615 --> 19:43.950
I KNOW WHO YOU ARE.

19:46.619 --> 19:48.288
CALEB?

19:48.321 --> 19:50.690
YOU MUST HAVE ME CONFUSED
WITH SOMEBODY ELSE.

19:50.723 --> 19:52.325
MY NAME'S ROMEO.

19:52.359 --> 19:54.227
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
SPENDING THE NIGHT
WITH YOUR MOM.

19:54.261 --> 19:55.928
I'M GONNA SEE HER TOMORROW.

19:55.962 --> 19:57.797
AND I WANTED TO SURPRISE YOU.

19:57.830 --> 19:58.898
I'M SURPRISED.

19:58.931 --> 20:00.633
I CAN'T TAKE ALL THE CREDIT.

20:00.667 --> 20:04.404
MONA HELPED ME
PICK OUT THE COSTUME.

20:04.437 --> 20:06.939
WAIT-- MONA, YOU DID THIS?

20:06.973 --> 20:08.508
CALL ME GUILTY.

20:08.541 --> 20:10.743
YOU KNOW, I'M SORRY
FOR YESTERDAY.

20:10.777 --> 20:14.447
FROM NOW ON, I PROMISE,
NO MORE SECRETS, OKAY?

20:14.481 --> 20:16.949
YOU'LL TELL ME
ABOUT IT LATER.

20:16.983 --> 20:19.018
NOW, GO DANCE WITH
YOUR SIZZLING HOT TODDY

20:19.051 --> 20:20.787
BEFORE HE MELTS THE ROOM.

20:20.820 --> 20:22.689
( giggles )

20:22.722 --> 20:24.023
I LOVE YOU, MONA.

20:24.056 --> 20:25.925
I LOVE YOU TOO.

20:31.464 --> 20:33.433
I HAVE TO ADMIT...

20:33.466 --> 20:34.867
YOU HAD ME FOOLED.

20:34.901 --> 20:37.670
BUT I'VE GOT YOU
FIGURED OUT.

20:37.704 --> 20:39.806
DO TELL.

20:39.839 --> 20:42.442
I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU HIDE
BEHIND THAT LAYER OF
SUPERFICIAL BITCH,

20:42.475 --> 20:44.711
BUT YOU ARE
A GREAT FRIEND TO HANNA.

20:46.413 --> 20:49.782
THAT MEANS MORE TO ME
THAN YOU'LL EVER KNOW.

20:49.816 --> 20:52.719
THANKS TO ALISON,
I WENT YEARS WITHOUT
ANY FRIENDS.

20:52.752 --> 20:54.454
WE NEVER STOOD UP TO HER.

20:55.688 --> 20:57.023
I'M SORRY FOR THAT.

20:59.091 --> 21:02.395
I QUIT THINKING ABOUT
THAT STUFF A LONG TIME AGO.

21:02.429 --> 21:06.866
BUT IT'S FUNNY-- TODAY
I JUST COULDN'T GET
HER OUT OF MY MIND.

21:08.668 --> 21:11.704
I TOOK CALEB TO THAT
STORE I WAS TALKING
ABOUT YESTERDAY.

21:11.738 --> 21:13.840
IT'S A TINY PLACE.
THANK YOU.

21:13.873 --> 21:16.476
YOU'D NEVER FIND IT
IF YOU DIDN'T KNOW
IT WAS THERE.

21:16.509 --> 21:17.810
IT'S IN BROOKHAVEN.

21:17.844 --> 21:19.646
I KNOW BROOKHAVEN.

21:19.679 --> 21:22.849
IT'S THE LAST PLACE
I SAW ALI ALIVE,

21:22.882 --> 21:24.784
ABOUT A WEEK BEFORE
SHE WENT MISSING.

21:27.354 --> 21:29.456
ALISON?

21:29.489 --> 21:30.623
CRAP.

21:30.657 --> 21:32.024
( laughing )

21:32.058 --> 21:33.626
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU'RE HERE.

21:33.660 --> 21:36.696
IT'S KIND OF LIKE
WE'RE SHOPPING TOGETHER.

21:36.729 --> 21:37.830
ALISON?

21:37.864 --> 21:38.998
SHH.

21:39.031 --> 21:41.000
WHY ARE YOU DRESSED
LIKE THAT?

21:41.033 --> 21:42.635
WHAT'S GOING ON?

21:42.669 --> 21:44.337
IS IT SOME SORT
OF A GAME?

21:44.371 --> 21:47.039
MONA, CAN I
TELL YOU A SECRET?

21:47.073 --> 21:48.575
FOR REAL?

21:48.608 --> 21:50.977
IT'S FOR REAL,
AND FOR KEEPS.

21:51.010 --> 21:53.580
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU'RE TALKING TO ME.

21:53.613 --> 21:55.682
YEAH, WELL...

21:55.715 --> 21:58.418
I-I'M WATCHING SOMEONE.
WHO?

21:58.451 --> 22:02.889
MONA, THIS ISN'T A GAME.

22:02.922 --> 22:06.759
JUST PRETEND LIKE
YOU DON'T KNOW ME
AND TAKE OFF, OKAY?

22:06.793 --> 22:09.862
WOW. THE ALI D.
NEEDS SOMETHING

22:09.896 --> 22:12.999
FROM MONA VANDERWAAL.

22:13.032 --> 22:15.034
WHAT'S IT WORTH TO YOU?

22:15.067 --> 22:17.670
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

22:17.704 --> 22:19.372
TO BE POPULAR.

22:37.790 --> 22:39.492
( laughing softly )

22:43.896 --> 22:46.098
I LEFT HER A MESSAGE
THAT NIGHT,

22:46.132 --> 22:47.867
BUT THEN SHE WENT
ALL M.I.A. ON US,

22:47.900 --> 22:49.035
AND SHE NEVER CALLED ME.

22:49.068 --> 22:51.804
DID YOU SEE WHO
ALISON WAS WATCHING?

22:51.838 --> 22:54.407
DO YOU MEAN
WHO SHE WAS SPYING ON?

22:54.441 --> 22:57.644
NO, IT WAS PROBABLY JUST
SOME GUY SHE HAD A CRUSH ON.

22:57.677 --> 23:00.146
"A" WASN'T WATCHING ALI
IN BROOKHAVEN.

23:00.179 --> 23:02.749
ALI WAS WATCHING "A."
OKAY, WAIT.

23:02.782 --> 23:05.051
IF THIS IS "A" CODE,
I DIDN'T GET THE HANDBOOK.

23:05.084 --> 23:10.022
LOOK, ALI CHECKED INTO
A MOTEL THE DAY BEFORE
SHE WENT MISSING.

23:10.056 --> 23:11.891
SHE DIDN'T GO THERE
TO HIDE FROM "A."

23:11.924 --> 23:14.861
I THINK SHE
FOLLOWED "A" THERE.

23:18.230 --> 23:20.933
* THOUGHT I COULDN'T
 LIVE WITHOUT YOU *

23:20.967 --> 23:24.070
* IT'S GONNA HURT
 WHEN IT HEALS TOO *

23:24.103 --> 23:26.072
* OH, YEAH

23:26.105 --> 23:29.942
* IT'LL ALL GET BETTER
 IN TIME *

23:29.976 --> 23:32.979
* EVEN THOUGH
 I REALLY LOVE YOU *

23:33.012 --> 23:35.782
* I'M GONNA SMILE
 'CAUSE I DESERVE TO *

23:38.017 --> 23:42.455
* IT'LL ALL
 GET BETTER IN TIME *

23:42.489 --> 23:45.658
* SINCE THERE'S NO MORE
 YOU AND ME... *

23:45.692 --> 23:47.594
( indistinct party chatter )

24:09.281 --> 24:10.683
HELLO?

24:14.153 --> 24:15.988
NO MATTER HOW HARD I TRY...

24:18.057 --> 24:20.893
I CAN'T STAY AWAY FROM YOU.

24:20.927 --> 24:23.462
Male Vocalist:
 * I'VE BEEN AWAY TOO LONG

24:28.935 --> 24:32.104
* AND HER HEART
 IS SO STRONG *

24:34.541 --> 24:36.776
* IT'S STRONG ENOUGH

24:36.809 --> 24:40.146
* IF ONLY YOU COULD SEE

24:41.213 --> 24:44.917
* ALWAYS

24:44.951 --> 24:48.087
* ALWAYS SHE WAITS FOR YOU

24:48.120 --> 24:51.558
* ALWAYS

24:51.591 --> 24:54.160
* ALWAYS SHE WAITS FOR YOU *

24:54.193 --> 24:55.962
Spencer: KEEP YOUR
 FRIENDS CLOSE, EM.

24:55.995 --> 24:57.597
SPENCER, WHERE ARE YOU?

24:57.630 --> 24:58.998
THAT'S
WHAT ALI WAS DOING,

24:59.031 --> 25:00.767
KEEPING HER ENEMIES
EVEN CLOSER.

25:00.800 --> 25:02.869
I'M ON MY WAY
BACK TO THE MOTEL
RIGHT NOW.

25:02.902 --> 25:04.604
NOW?
 YES!

25:04.637 --> 25:06.573
WHEN WE CHECKED
INTO THE MOTEL,
THERE WAS A KEY

25:06.606 --> 25:08.608
FOR EVERY ROOM
AVAILABLE EXCEPT
FOR ROOM TWO.

25:08.641 --> 25:11.611
ROOM TWO HASN'T BEEN
BOOKED SINCE BEFORE
ALI WENT MISSING.

25:11.644 --> 25:13.312
DON'T YOU GET IT, EM?

25:13.345 --> 25:16.015
NOBODY CHECKS INTO ROOM TWO
BECAUSE IT'S BEEN RENTED,

25:16.048 --> 25:19.318
AND ALI CHECKED INTO
THE ROOM NEXT DOOR BECAUSE
SHE WAS SPYING ON "A."

25:19.351 --> 25:21.788
SPENCER, DON'T GO
OUT THERE ALONE.
WAIT FOR US.

25:21.821 --> 25:24.557
NO, I DON'T WANT
US ALL TO LEAVE.
WE CAN'T TIP "A" OFF.

25:24.591 --> 25:26.926
AND BESIDES,
I'M NOT ALONE.
I'M WITH MONA.

25:32.231 --> 25:34.801
OKAY, YOU'VE GOT TWO HOURS
TO GET BACK HERE.

25:34.834 --> 25:36.002
OKAY.

25:36.035 --> 25:37.303
( cell phone beeps )

25:53.152 --> 25:55.888
IT'S KIND OF YOU TO TAKE
THE TIME TO SIT WITH ME.

25:55.922 --> 25:59.759
IT MUST GET LONELY OUT HERE.

25:59.792 --> 26:03.796
I FIND MYSELF TALKING
TO THESE STUFFED CREATURES.

26:03.830 --> 26:06.365
WELL, I GUESS YOU
REALLY ONLY HAVE TO WORRY

26:06.398 --> 26:09.001
IF THEY START
TO TALK BACK TO YOU.

26:09.035 --> 26:11.170
WHAT'S THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

26:12.304 --> 26:13.873
IT WAS A JOKE.

26:19.378 --> 26:21.247
UM... THANK YOU,

26:21.280 --> 26:23.182
FOR THE TEA.

26:24.851 --> 26:27.019
YOU HAVEN'T FINISHED.

26:29.121 --> 26:30.790
( door closes )

26:44.303 --> 26:46.706
( gasps )

26:46.739 --> 26:49.108
( indistinct party chatter )

26:49.141 --> 26:53.780
Female Vocalist:
 * LYING HERE WITH YOU
 SO CLOSE TO ME *

26:53.813 --> 26:55.982
* IT'S HARD TO FIGHT
 THESE FEELINGS *

26:56.015 --> 27:00.687
* WHEN IT FEELS
 SO HARD TO BREATHE *

27:00.720 --> 27:04.056
* I'M CAUGHT UP
 IN THIS MOMENT *

27:04.090 --> 27:08.961
* I'M CAUGHT UP
 IN YOUR SMILE *

27:08.995 --> 27:10.329
WHAT'S WRONG?

27:12.264 --> 27:14.834
THIS IS OUR FIRST DANCE.

27:14.867 --> 27:17.303
I WANT TO SEE YOU.

27:17.336 --> 27:20.707
* ...THE LOVE
 WE WANNA FIND *

27:20.740 --> 27:24.143
* IT'S NEVER FELT SO REAL

27:24.176 --> 27:25.745
Male Vocalist: * NO,
 IT'S NEVER FELT... *

27:25.778 --> 27:29.982
Vocalists:
 * SO RIGHT

27:30.016 --> 27:33.085
* JUST A KISS ON YOUR LIPS
 IN THE MOONLIGHT *

27:33.119 --> 27:36.422
* JUST A TOUCH IN
 THE FIRE BURNING SO BRIGHT *

27:36.455 --> 27:39.892
* NO, I DON'T WANT
 TO MESS THIS THING UP *

27:39.926 --> 27:43.195
* I DON'T WANNA
 PUSH TOO FAR *

27:43.229 --> 27:46.332
* JUST A SHOUT IN THE DARK
 THAT YOU JUST MIGHT *

27:46.365 --> 27:50.903
* BE THE ONE I'VE BEEN
 WAITING FOR MY WHOLE LIFE *

27:50.937 --> 27:53.940
* SO, BABY, I'M ALL RIGHT

27:53.973 --> 27:59.078
* WITH JUST
 A KISS GOOD NIGHT *

27:59.111 --> 28:06.152
* NO, I DON'T WANNA
 SAY GOOD NIGHT *

28:06.185 --> 28:09.388
* I KNOW IT'S TIME TO LEAVE

28:09.421 --> 28:13.292
* BUT YOU'LL BE
 IN MY DREAMS *

28:15.427 --> 28:17.129
* TONIGHT

28:17.163 --> 28:18.364
EMILY.

28:29.241 --> 28:30.743
Mona: OH, MY GOD.

29:02.441 --> 29:04.811
SPENCER,
WHAT IS THIS PLACE?

29:06.178 --> 29:08.114
THIS IS "A's" LAIR.

29:15.221 --> 29:17.323
I'M SORRY ABOUT
THE OTHER NIGHT.

29:17.356 --> 29:19.191
JUST FORGET ABOUT IT.

29:19.225 --> 29:20.927
THAT'S THE THING--

29:20.960 --> 29:24.463
I DON'T WANT
TO FORGET ABOUT IT.

29:24.496 --> 29:27.299
WE HAVE A CONNECTION.
YOU CAN'T DENY THAT.

29:28.367 --> 29:30.336
WE DID.

29:30.369 --> 29:35.174
BUT I...
I GET IT.
I MESSED IT UP.

29:37.143 --> 29:39.846
YOU WEREN'T READY,
AND THAT'S OKAY.

29:39.879 --> 29:43.249
I WISH I'D FOUGHT
HARDER FOR YOU.

29:43.282 --> 29:45.351
I'M SORRY, PAIGE.

29:45.384 --> 29:49.121
I DIDN'T TELL YOU
SO YOU'D BE SORRY.

29:49.155 --> 29:51.023
I JUST WANT TO BE HONEST.

29:51.057 --> 29:53.392
AND I CARE ABOUT YOU.

29:53.425 --> 29:57.163
SO I'LL BE HERE FOR YOU,
FOR WHATEVER YOU NEED.

29:57.196 --> 30:01.834
I THINK WHAT I NEED
RIGHT NOW IS A FRIEND.

30:03.335 --> 30:06.338
THEN IT'S OFFICIAL.
WE'RE FRIENDS.

30:06.372 --> 30:09.308
THAT MAKES ME HAPPY.

30:34.466 --> 30:35.834
Mona: SPENCER?

30:37.003 --> 30:39.205
THIS HAS
TO BE "A's" COSTUME.

30:43.309 --> 30:45.011
I'LL CALL HANNA.

30:51.350 --> 30:53.886
"A's" DRESSED
AS THE BLACK SWAN.

30:58.624 --> 31:01.293
( indistinct party chatter )

31:13.372 --> 31:14.907
Hanna: WHO IS THAT?

31:16.508 --> 31:18.177
( sighs )

31:23.449 --> 31:25.651
GUM?

31:25.684 --> 31:27.253
UH, NO, THANKS.

31:29.321 --> 31:30.556
OKAY.

31:30.589 --> 31:32.992
WHY AREN'T THEY
CALLING US BACK?

31:39.731 --> 31:42.034
THIS IS ALI'S DIARY.

31:49.075 --> 31:51.577
MELISSA WAS THE BLACK SWAN
AT A CHARITY BALL

31:51.610 --> 31:53.946
IN PHILLY LAST YEAR.

31:53.980 --> 31:57.049
YOU DON'T THINK SHE'D DO
ANYTHING TO TRY AND HURT
YOU, DO YOU?

32:01.153 --> 32:02.721
WHY WOULD YOU ASK ME THAT?

32:02.754 --> 32:06.125
WELL, I JUST THOUGHT
THAT'S WHAT YOU MEANT.

32:06.158 --> 32:10.062
MELISSA'S THE BLACK SWAN.
MAYBE SHE'S "A."

32:11.563 --> 32:14.100
ACTUALLY, CAN I HAVE
THAT GUM NOW?

32:14.133 --> 32:15.101
SURE.

32:16.468 --> 32:19.071
OH. YOU KNOW, I THINK
I HAVE MORE IN THE CAR,

32:19.105 --> 32:21.140
SO I'LL BE RIGHT BACK,
OKAY?

32:29.081 --> 32:32.218
( rock music playing )

32:32.251 --> 32:35.121
THERE SHE IS.

32:35.154 --> 32:36.255
WHO IS THAT?

32:36.288 --> 32:39.225
I CAN'T TELL FROM HERE.

32:39.258 --> 32:41.627
TALL, SIZE TWO.

32:41.660 --> 32:43.562
I HATE HER ALREADY.

32:47.333 --> 32:49.768
IT'S LUCAS.

32:49.801 --> 32:51.337
THEY'RE ALL TOGETHER.

32:53.339 --> 32:54.406
COME ON.

33:02.448 --> 33:04.516
( door opens )

33:04.550 --> 33:06.785
CASHMERE SWEATERS.

33:06.818 --> 33:09.055
Mona: I FOUND THE GUM.

33:12.491 --> 33:14.426
YOU DIDN'T CALL HANNA,
DID YOU?

33:17.229 --> 33:18.564
BECAUSE YOU'RE "A."

33:24.370 --> 33:26.638
CONGRATULATIONS, SPENCER.

33:26.672 --> 33:28.240
YOU FIGURED IT OUT.

33:36.415 --> 33:37.749
SHE'S LEAVING!
HURRY!

33:40.819 --> 33:42.088
IT'S LOCKED!

33:57.503 --> 34:00.172
( groans softly )

34:00.206 --> 34:01.307
( gasps )

34:05.677 --> 34:08.514
( tires squeal )

34:08.547 --> 34:10.248
I'M CALLING SPENCER.

34:12.518 --> 34:14.453
( sighs ) THIS PHONE
IS A PIECE OF CRAP.

34:14.485 --> 34:15.554
I'LL CALL HER.

34:17.322 --> 34:19.091
THAT'S WEIRD.

34:19.125 --> 34:20.126
WHAT?

34:20.159 --> 34:21.226
HERE.

34:23.429 --> 34:26.364
YOUR PHONE IS SET TO RECORD
EVERY TIME IT'S TURNED ON.

34:31.902 --> 34:34.706
I HAD TO GET YOU OUT THERE
ALONE, SO WE COULD TALK.

34:34.739 --> 34:35.873
OKAY.

34:35.907 --> 34:38.877
JUST SLOW DOWN, OKAY?
LET'S TALK.

34:38.909 --> 34:40.679
YOU HAD TO EARN IT--

34:40.712 --> 34:43.849
THE RIGHT
TO BE A PART OF IT.

34:43.882 --> 34:46.185
YOU DIDN'T SEE ALI
IN BROOKHAVEN.

34:46.217 --> 34:48.420
SHE SAW YOU,
DIDN'T SHE?

34:48.454 --> 34:50.688
( tires squeal )

34:50.722 --> 34:53.292
YOU JUST MADE THAT STORY UP.

34:53.324 --> 34:54.693
WE'RE IN THIS TOGETHER NOW.

34:57.329 --> 34:59.631
I ADMIRE YOU, SPENCER.

34:59.665 --> 35:02.801
THAT'S WHY YOU GET
TO DECIDE HOW THIS
ENDS, TONIGHT.

35:02.834 --> 35:07.473
YOU CAN JOIN THE "A" TEAM,
OR YOU CAN DISAPPEAR.

35:11.377 --> 35:13.912
YOU... YOU
ALMOST KILLED HANNA.

35:13.945 --> 35:15.347
SHE'S MY FRIEND.

35:15.381 --> 35:17.683
I THOUGHT SHE WAS
 YOUR FRIEND TOO.

35:17.716 --> 35:21.187
IT'S EASIER TO FORGIVE
 AN ENEMY THAN IT IS
 TO FORGIVE A FRIEND.

35:21.220 --> 35:23.589
OH, MY GOD.
IT'S MONA.

35:26.558 --> 35:28.294
HOW DID YOU DO IT?

35:28.327 --> 35:30.196
HOW COULD YOU
BE EVERYWHERE?

35:30.229 --> 35:32.231
YOU WERE ALWAYS
ONE STEP AHEAD OF US.

35:32.264 --> 35:35.567
YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY
GENIUS IN THIS CAR.

35:35.601 --> 35:37.736
YOU BITCHES
 UNDERESTIMATED ME.

35:37.769 --> 35:39.405
( gasps )

35:43.942 --> 35:46.745
( car accelerates )

35:46.778 --> 35:49.448
YOU'RE NEVER GONNA MAKE IT
TO LOOKOUT POINT

35:49.481 --> 35:51.317
IF YOU DON'T SLOW DOWN.

35:51.350 --> 35:53.285
( tires squeal )

35:53.319 --> 35:55.221
THEY'RE GOING
TO LOOKOUT POINT.

35:55.254 --> 35:57.556
I KNOW A SHORTCUT.
COME ON.

35:57.589 --> 35:59.758
HANNA.

35:59.791 --> 36:01.327
MONA'S "A."

36:05.831 --> 36:07.399
COME ON.

36:11.770 --> 36:13.705
IS THIS
SOME KIND OF PAYBACK?

36:13.739 --> 36:15.707
BECAUSE WE LET ALI
TREAT YOU LIKE THAT?

36:15.741 --> 36:18.410
I AM SO OVER ALI.
I TOLD YOU.

36:18.444 --> 36:21.613
SHE WAS NEVER MY FRIEND,
BUT HANNA WAS.

36:21.647 --> 36:23.815
AND YOU BITCHES
TOOK HER FROM ME.

36:23.849 --> 36:25.884
THIS IS ABOUT BETRAYAL?

36:25.917 --> 36:29.588
IT'S NOT ABOUT
BETRAYAL, SPENCER,
IT'S ABOUT REVENGE!

36:29.621 --> 36:32.524
YOU DESERVED
EVERYTHING YOU GOT!

36:32.558 --> 36:34.626
YOU STOLE MY ONLY FRIEND.

36:34.660 --> 36:37.229
MONA,
SHE'S STILL YOUR FRIEND!

36:39.765 --> 36:41.900
OKAY.

36:41.933 --> 36:43.802
SO WHAT'S THE PLAN?

36:43.835 --> 36:46.972
I MEAN, "A" ALWAYS
HAS A PLAN, RIGHT?

36:47.005 --> 36:49.475
YES. SHE DOES.

36:58.517 --> 37:00.786
WHAT HAPPENS
IF I DON'T JOIN THE TEAM?

37:00.819 --> 37:04.490
MELISSA DOESN'T HAVE
YOUR DAD'S GUN. I DO.

37:07.893 --> 37:10.996
WHEN ALI LEFT,
IT PULLED YOU GUYS APART.

37:11.029 --> 37:13.699
IT'LL BE THE SAME
IF YOU GO AWAY.

37:13.732 --> 37:16.535
NO, IT WON'T.

37:16.568 --> 37:18.437
( tires squeal )

37:19.571 --> 37:21.239
AAH!

37:26.712 --> 37:28.380
HANNA, STOP!
HANNA!

37:28.414 --> 37:29.415
HANNA, STOP!
HANNA!

37:29.448 --> 37:30.682
HANNA!
HANNA!

37:30.716 --> 37:33.652
( tires screech )
HANNA!

37:37.723 --> 37:39.658
( screaming )

37:45.564 --> 37:46.798
GET UP!

37:49.735 --> 37:51.403
SPENCER!

37:56.375 --> 37:57.776
AAAHHH!
MONA!

37:57.809 --> 38:00.346
OH, MY GOD!

38:00.379 --> 38:01.747
( all gasping )

38:01.780 --> 38:02.948
YOU OKAY?

38:02.981 --> 38:04.049
YEAH.

38:04.082 --> 38:05.951
( weeping softly )

38:09.788 --> 38:11.857
( siren wails )

38:16.428 --> 38:17.763
DR. SULLIVAN?

38:19.998 --> 38:22.401
ARE YOU ALL OKAY?

38:22.434 --> 38:23.802
WE TRIED TO FIND YOU.

38:23.835 --> 38:26.672
WHAT DID SHE DO TO YOU?
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

38:26.705 --> 38:28.774
SHE THREATENED MY SON.

38:28.807 --> 38:31.076
I DIDN'T THINK
I HAD A CHOICE.

38:31.109 --> 38:34.813
I NEEDED TO LEAVE.
I'M SO VERY SORRY.

38:36.748 --> 38:38.584
HANNA...

38:38.617 --> 38:41.653
HANNA, IT'S ALL RIGHT.
YOU'RE SAFE NOW.

38:43.889 --> 38:45.724
( Hanna weeping softly )

38:45.757 --> 38:47.959
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.

38:52.163 --> 38:54.032
SHE WAS MY FRIEND.

38:54.065 --> 38:57.002
( weeping )

38:59.705 --> 39:01.039
IT'S OVER, ARIA.

39:07.178 --> 39:08.980
Man: SHE'S ALIVE!

39:12.117 --> 39:14.019
( indistinct remark )

39:16.788 --> 39:19.925
( watch alarm beeping )

39:30.769 --> 39:35.874
SHE WAS LIVING IN
A PERPETUAL STATE
OF HYPER REALITY.

39:35.907 --> 39:37.609
THE ADRENALINE RUSH
THAT ACCOMPANIED

39:37.643 --> 39:39.010
HER FEELINGS OF EMPOWERMENT

39:39.044 --> 39:41.480
AND HER HIGH LEVEL
OF INTELLIGENCE

39:41.513 --> 39:43.449
FUELED MONA'S ABILITY

39:43.482 --> 39:46.585
TO BE SEEMINGLY ALL-KNOWING
AND OMNIPRESENT.

39:46.618 --> 39:49.621
WILL SHE ALWAYS BE LIKE THIS?

39:49.655 --> 39:52.558
WITH THERAPY
AND THE RIGHT MEDICATIONS,

39:52.591 --> 39:54.860
PEOPLE WITH THESE
PERSONALITY DISORDERS

39:54.893 --> 39:56.127
CAN GET BETTER.

39:59.665 --> 40:01.833
I KNOW THEY'RE WATCHING ME.

40:01.867 --> 40:04.436
I DON'T LOOK BAD,
 CONSIDERING.

40:04.470 --> 40:06.438
I LIKE THIS LIPSTICK.

40:06.472 --> 40:10.108
WHAT'S IT CALLED?
 TOFFEE TANGO?

40:10.141 --> 40:11.977
THEY THINK IT'S OVER.

40:12.010 --> 40:14.112
LOSER MONA'S GOING
 TO THE NUTHOUSE,

40:14.145 --> 40:16.014
AND THOSE PRECIOUS LIARS
 ARE GOING HOME TO SLEEP

40:16.047 --> 40:19.017
WITH THEIR WINDOWS OPEN
 AND THEIR DOORS UNLOCKED.

40:19.050 --> 40:21.587
DON'T THEY KNOW
 THAT'S WHAT WE WANT?

40:23.188 --> 40:25.757
I NEVER THOUGHT I'D FIND
THE STRENGTH TO COME BACK HERE,

40:25.791 --> 40:28.494
BUT YOUR FRIEND SHOWED UP,
AND HE WAS VERY CONVINCING.

40:28.527 --> 40:30.496
I HELP PEOPLE PUSH
THROUGH THEIR FEARS,

40:30.529 --> 40:31.897
BUT HE HELPED ME
PUSH THROUGH MINE.

40:31.930 --> 40:33.131
WAIT, OUR FRIEND?

40:50.816 --> 40:52.784
PRETENDING NOT TO LOVE YOU

40:52.818 --> 40:54.753
WAS THE HARDEST THING
I'VE EVER DONE.

41:10.035 --> 41:12.604
( Spencer weeping softly )

41:30.556 --> 41:32.658
YOU GONNA BE OKAY
AT HOME TONIGHT?

41:32.691 --> 41:34.225
I KNOW MONA'S "A."

41:34.259 --> 41:38.129
I JUST KEEP SEEING
THAT FACELESS PERSON
IN THE BLACK HOODIE.

41:38.163 --> 41:39.831
LET'S SLEEP AT MY PLACE.

41:39.865 --> 41:42.100
MY MOM WILL BE THRILLED
TO HAVE A REASON TO COOK.

41:42.133 --> 41:43.735
THAT SOUNDS LIKE OLD TIMES.

41:44.903 --> 41:46.071
( sigh )

41:46.104 --> 41:48.173
( sirens wail )

41:54.980 --> 41:57.749
Female Vocalist:
 * IT JUST TAKES A SECOND

41:57.783 --> 42:02.020
* FOR MY WORLD
 TO COME CRUMBLING DOWN *

42:06.825 --> 42:08.994
* OH, I'M SURE
 IN THE DISTANCE... *

42:09.027 --> 42:11.797
HONEY,
THEY FOUND A BODY.

42:13.364 --> 42:16.301
THEY THINK IT'S--
IT'S MAYA.

42:17.969 --> 42:21.640
* OH, I PLEAD
 FOR AN ANSWER *

42:21.673 --> 42:23.675
* PLEAD FOR AN ANSWER

42:23.709 --> 42:25.176
* FROM YOU

42:29.080 --> 42:32.250
* BUT IF YOU
 GIVE ME AN ANSWER *

42:32.283 --> 42:34.720
* THAT JUST MAKES NO SENSE

42:34.753 --> 42:36.822
* THEN WHAT'S THE USE?

42:38.890 --> 42:40.592
* AND JUST LIKE THAT

42:40.626 --> 42:43.161
* MY LIFE IS BROKEN

42:43.194 --> 42:44.963
* I CAN BARELY BREATHE

42:44.996 --> 42:49.000
* AND NOW I'M OPEN
 FOR SUGGESTIONS *

42:52.070 --> 42:53.639
* AND HOW

42:53.672 --> 42:55.273
* MANY SECONDS

42:55.306 --> 42:56.742
* IN THE HOURS

42:56.775 --> 42:57.876
* OF A DAY

42:57.909 --> 43:00.812
* DID WE LOSE?

43:12.724 --> 43:15.326
MONA,
YOU HAVE A VISITOR.

43:27.305 --> 43:29.875
I DID EVERYTHING
YOU ASKED ME TO.
