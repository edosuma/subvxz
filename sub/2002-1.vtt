00:28.441 --> 00:30.921
It's a normal Tuesday in Britain.

00:31.281 --> 00:33.533
There's a hint of
drizzle in the air

00:33.534 --> 00:35.481
and traffic is at a standstill.

00:37.121 --> 00:40.201
We know that driving is meant
to be more fun than this.

00:40.281 --> 00:43.961
We know that cars are meant
to be more fun than this.

00:44.161 --> 00:48.841
So we decided what we'd do is give
you an hour or so of escapism,

00:48.961 --> 00:51.841
of perfect roads and perfect cars.

00:51.921 --> 00:53.921
Yeah. So, what we're
going to do is

00:54.001 --> 00:56.441
strip away all the things
that drive us mad,

00:56.521 --> 00:58.761
roadworks, Peugeots,
speed cameras...

00:58.841 --> 01:00.208
- James May.
- Yeah, we'll get rid of him.

01:00.281 --> 01:01.681
He's always holding us up.

01:01.761 --> 01:07.561
And then we will end up
with the perfect road trip.

01:12.041 --> 01:17.241
Strangely, Jeremy insisted we
should start here, in Venice,

01:18.281 --> 01:21.361
where all the streets
are full of water.

01:24.281 --> 01:26.041
Why are we in Venice?

01:26.121 --> 01:28.601
Because I wanted to drive
the Riva Aquarama.

01:28.681 --> 01:29.721
Why?

01:29.961 --> 01:32.161
Because it's the most
beautiful thing ever made

01:32.281 --> 01:34.281
and because it's got two V8s.

01:34.361 --> 01:36.635
Okay, we are starting
in Venice because

01:36.636 --> 01:38.681
he wanted to drive
a... What is it?

01:38.801 --> 01:40.681
- Riva Aquarama.
- Riva Aquarama.

01:40.761 --> 01:41.994
The most beautiful
thing ever made.

01:41.995 --> 01:43.195
The most beautiful thing ever made

01:43.196 --> 01:44.281
and it's got... Two V8s?

01:44.282 --> 01:46.001
- Two V8s.
- Two V8s.

01:46.321 --> 01:49.641
And we're going to set off from
here on a journey across Italy,

01:49.801 --> 01:53.161
across France, to...
Where are we going?

01:53.241 --> 01:55.401
- Pau.
- To Pau... Pau?

01:55.961 --> 01:57.081
Why are we going to Pau?

01:57.161 --> 02:01.761
Because that is where the first
ever Grand Prix was held.

02:01.961 --> 02:02.961
- Pau?
- Yeah.

02:03.521 --> 02:05.121
- Never heard of it.
- The track's still there.

02:05.201 --> 02:08.640
We're going to drive the
very first Grand Prix track.

02:08.721 --> 02:11.881
Whatever. Between here and there,
we're going to be on motorways,

02:11.961 --> 02:15.201
mountain roads, rally stages,
racetracks and cities.

02:15.361 --> 02:18.401
And in every place, we are both
going to pick what we believe

02:18.481 --> 02:20.641
is the perfect mode of transport.

02:20.721 --> 02:22.521
It's going to be the perfect week.

02:22.961 --> 02:27.241
Perfect weather, perfect start,
perfect boat, perfect everything.

02:27.321 --> 02:29.001
- Perfect.
- And no James May.

02:29.081 --> 02:31.241
That's better than perfect.

02:35.401 --> 02:38.441
Over the next seven days,
our quest for perfection

02:38.521 --> 02:41.721
would take us from Venice
towards the Italian Lakes.

02:42.761 --> 02:45.121
From there we'd head south
to the Mediterranean,

02:45.201 --> 02:48.641
for a drive along the French
Riviera to Saint-Tropez.

02:49.441 --> 02:52.014
Then we'd swing
inland again towards

02:52.015 --> 02:53.961
the finishing point at Pau.

02:58.681 --> 03:01.161
Do we look like
Tubbs and Crockett?

03:02.401 --> 03:03.921
Or Tubby and Crotchety?

03:07.561 --> 03:09.355
No, seriously. That's
perfect, though.

03:09.356 --> 03:10.361
Tubby and Crotchety.

03:10.681 --> 03:11.841
Venice Vice.

03:16.521 --> 03:19.681
Having docked the
L200,000 speedboat,

03:19.841 --> 03:23.161
I switched to an even
more expensive car.

03:23.441 --> 03:28.521
The new, grown-up, less tail-happy
Black edition of the SLS.

03:34.201 --> 03:36.881
In Victorian times, people
would come through Venice

03:36.961 --> 03:39.041
on what was called
"the grand tour",

03:39.121 --> 03:41.601
so that's why I've
gone for the Mercedes,

03:41.681 --> 03:44.761
because it is the
ultimate grand tourer.

03:44.881 --> 03:49.081
Except, it isn't the ultimate
because this is, the Ferrari F12.

03:49.161 --> 03:50.881
No, no. That's too powerful.

03:50.961 --> 03:53.121
- Too powerful?
- It is too powerful.

03:53.201 --> 03:54.481
I said that... It is.

03:54.561 --> 03:56.921
You did say it on the programme
and I thought then...

03:57.041 --> 04:00.041
You see this? I will be able
to use all of the power.

04:00.121 --> 04:01.121
Yes?

04:01.201 --> 04:03.081
In that, you will not be
able to use all of the power

04:03.161 --> 04:05.121
because you'll end up halfway
up a telegraph pole.

04:05.201 --> 04:06.881
No, I'll be able to
all of the power

04:06.961 --> 04:08.448
but there will be more power than

04:08.449 --> 04:10.161
you've got, that's
all that's about.

04:10.241 --> 04:11.761
A grand tourer should be powerful

04:11.841 --> 04:13.921
and creamy and grunty and...

04:14.001 --> 04:15.206
Six hundred and twenty-two

04:15.207 --> 04:16.921
horsepower, it's
not a wheelbarrow.

04:17.120 --> 04:19.071
Seven hundred and
thirty. It's more.

04:19.072 --> 04:21.081
- I know.
- Hammond.

04:21.641 --> 04:24.241
Let's just go across Italy,
shall we, in our grand tourers?

04:24.321 --> 04:26.281
Yes. Yes.

04:26.601 --> 04:29.001
I'LL go quickly, you big girl.

04:37.321 --> 04:38.721
Oh, God.

04:42.001 --> 04:44.441
Oh, that's a lot of power.

04:44.521 --> 04:46.641
Maybe that's too much.
No, it's not too much.

04:46.721 --> 04:49.081
Jeremy's being a wuss.
It's just enough.

04:49.161 --> 04:51.001
It's just I don't need to
use all of it right now.

04:51.081 --> 04:53.521
I'm going to use a bit Less.
Maybe this much of it.

04:55.921 --> 04:58.681
The changes from that
gearbox are incredible.

04:58.921 --> 05:01.841
It's a double clutch gear
box. In actual fact,

05:01.921 --> 05:06.401
it's exactly the same unit
as in Jeremy's Mercedes SLS.

05:06.481 --> 05:08.681
It's just Ferrari have
put their own mapping,

05:08.761 --> 05:11.041
their own computer control
on this particular one.

05:11.121 --> 05:13.641
And it's set up so
that when you change,

05:13.721 --> 05:16.161
it spikes the engine revs so
it surges when you change.

05:19.401 --> 05:20.961
Dear God.

05:23.441 --> 05:25.561
This body isn't just pretty,

05:25.681 --> 05:28.141
it's been sculpted
to maximise the air

05:28.142 --> 05:30.601
flowing over it to
generate down force

05:30.801 --> 05:32.121
to stick it to the road

05:44.761 --> 05:49.081
There have been a number of Black
Special Edition Mercs in the past

05:49.201 --> 05:51.283
and almost all of them have been,

05:51.284 --> 05:53.681
well, dreadful,
really. Undriveable.

05:54.641 --> 05:59.241
They generated too much torque. So
every time you put your foot down,

05:59.321 --> 06:02.721
it felt like they were trying
to tear themselves apart.

06:05.761 --> 06:08.041
You'd be going along and
it'd be sucking birds

06:08.121 --> 06:10.361
and trees and squirrels
into the engine

06:10.441 --> 06:12.857
and then ripping up
the road and hurling

06:12.858 --> 06:14.801
chunks of tarmac out of the back

06:14.921 --> 06:17.721
and it was just...
They were ridiculous.

06:19.521 --> 06:22.321
This, though, Mercedes
has been clever

06:22.401 --> 06:26.281
because, yes, it generates
more power than a standard SLS

06:26.361 --> 06:29.241
but 11 fewer torques. So now...

06:32.081 --> 06:36.121
You put your foot down, it
translates that action into speed,

06:36.761 --> 06:38.201
not destructions.

06:40.601 --> 06:43.161
Oh, but you can't beat a V8.

06:43.961 --> 06:48.801
I mean, yes, a V12 is
nice. But a V8 is nicer.

06:49.521 --> 06:50.521
It just is.

06:51.321 --> 06:53.641
I'm just saying you
can't beat a V8.

06:54.361 --> 06:58.281
Oh, I like a 12, I do like a big
powerful, slightly angry 12.

07:03.121 --> 07:05.281
That's a great car, that.

07:06.921 --> 07:09.161
It's... You just give
it a little poke,

07:09.241 --> 07:10.841
"Excuse me, could you..."

07:12.801 --> 07:14.281
That is insane.

07:15.561 --> 07:17.161
I was very happy.

07:17.241 --> 07:21.521
And therefore a bit surprised
when Jeremy suddenly veered off

07:21.721 --> 07:24.921
toward some old Italian town.

07:32.281 --> 07:33.281
There it is.

07:34.441 --> 07:36.281
- What? That?
- Yeah.

07:36.921 --> 07:40.441
That is the actual balcony
from Romeo and Juliet.

07:40.521 --> 07:42.321
- Yeah. Couple of points.
- What?

07:42.401 --> 07:45.121
I've got a Ferrari, it's a
beautiful day, I'm in Italy.

07:45.201 --> 07:48.921
You're looking at a balcony
that was in a story... Story.

07:49.001 --> 07:51.201
Made up by a man who you
said you don't like.

07:51.281 --> 07:53.401
I hate William Shakespeare
but it's... Come on.

07:53.481 --> 07:56.681
It's not real, it's a
story. It was pretend.

07:56.761 --> 07:59.241
You're on a tour of Europe,
you need to see stuff.

07:59.321 --> 08:01.481
I'm on a tour of
Europe, in a Ferrari,

08:01.561 --> 08:02.881
except I'm not in a Ferrari,

08:02.961 --> 08:05.361
I'm standing here Looking
at an old building.

08:06.761 --> 08:10.881
Happily, a big crowd of Italian
Top Gear fans then stopped him

08:10.961 --> 08:13.335
from getting into
some old theatre so

08:13.336 --> 08:15.521
we could get back on the motorway.

08:19.321 --> 08:21.481
If he's going to
ruin this road trip

08:21.561 --> 08:25.801
by stopping off to look at old
things that don't move, I'll...

08:27.601 --> 08:29.281
I should've remembered, of course,

08:29.361 --> 08:32.481
Hammond isn't going to want
to do anything cultural

08:32.561 --> 08:36.081
and he isn't going to want
to eat anything interesting.

08:36.160 --> 08:38.760
It's like travelling around
with a garden chair.

08:41.400 --> 08:44.681
I therefore decided to
annoy him some more.

08:45.281 --> 08:47.481
- Hammond?
- What?

08:47.681 --> 08:49.121
Shall we turn off here?

08:49.521 --> 08:51.201
What, now? Why would we?

08:51.881 --> 08:53.888
Well, because I'm
bored of driving on

08:53.889 --> 08:56.001
motorways, I want to
go on other roads.

08:57.721 --> 08:59.161
Is there an old pile of bricks

08:59.241 --> 09:02.161
or a gate that once featured
in a fairy tale down here?

09:03.121 --> 09:06.721
No, no. It's driving but
just on nice roads.

09:06.961 --> 09:10.481
We're not going to look at Hansel
and Gretel's handbag or something?

09:15.081 --> 09:17.961
In fact, we were heading
for the Italian Lakes,

09:18.161 --> 09:22.521
a sparkling jewel in the golden
crown of our perfect journey.

09:31.681 --> 09:36.041
And soon I realised that cars
like these on days like these

09:36.201 --> 09:40.521
have been used before, at the
beginning of. The Italian job.

09:41.441 --> 09:47.281
I know just the music we need
for this bit of our drive.

09:48.881 --> 09:50.401
Cue the Monro.

09:59.721 --> 10:00.761
Ooh, this is pretty,

10:00.841 --> 10:03.013
Looking at all of
these Italian things

10:03.014 --> 10:05.241
from my Italian grand
touring supercar.

10:06.041 --> 10:09.321
We just have to be careful
that if we go into a tunnel,

10:09.401 --> 10:11.281
we don't hit a bulldozer.

10:23.561 --> 10:25.561
Oh, that's just... Oh.

10:26.161 --> 10:28.401
This is just magnificent.

10:30.841 --> 10:34.321
But soon the real reason for
turning off became apparent.

10:34.441 --> 10:36.721
As the roads became more twisty,

10:36.801 --> 10:39.801
the Ferrari was becoming
more of a handful.

10:42.641 --> 10:44.281
Oho. Oh.

10:48.081 --> 10:50.982
Just need to be a
bit careful about

10:50.983 --> 10:53.641
unleashing 730 brake horsepower.

10:57.481 --> 11:00.029
It's actually more
than an F1 car and

11:00.030 --> 11:02.241
I'm conscious of that right now.

11:02.321 --> 11:04.481
Help. Oh.

11:05.921 --> 11:08.241
Oh. Yeah.

11:08.321 --> 11:09.441
I wasn't scared

11:12.721 --> 11:17.001
I have no doubt that the
Ferrari is faster than this

11:17.081 --> 11:23.401
but this is just nicer to drive
because it's less frightening.

11:26.321 --> 11:29.121
With the F12, Ferrari have
given you everything you need

11:29.201 --> 11:30.841
to have an incredible drive

11:30.921 --> 11:33.601
or get yourself into a very
great deal of trouble.

11:35.121 --> 11:37.161
Get a racing driver in this
car and he will tell you,

11:37.241 --> 11:38.481
"Yes, that is a real car."

11:39.721 --> 11:43.001
It's not been tamed for people
to park at the golf course

11:43.121 --> 11:44.721
and talk about in the bar.

11:45.881 --> 11:49.001
It's amazing how different
this is to the standard SLS,

11:49.081 --> 11:52.881
which would be wobbling its
bottom all over everywhere.

11:52.961 --> 11:55.601
This isn't because of its
electronic differential.

11:57.161 --> 11:59.961
You can think of it really
like a Porsche GT3,

12:00.241 --> 12:05.401
lightened, hard, focused,
on it, built for this.

12:09.001 --> 12:11.441
The SLS behaving like this is like

12:11.841 --> 12:15.321
Eddie Izzard doing
Richard III, it's...

12:16.241 --> 12:19.801
It's almost weird to watch
a pantomime character

12:19.881 --> 12:22.481
become so straight.

12:23.281 --> 12:25.161
Weird and yet brilliant.

12:28.201 --> 12:30.601
Eventually, we reached
our overnight halt

12:30.681 --> 12:33.601
and I went for supper with
my cultured colleague.

12:36.121 --> 12:38.681
What do you mean you
prefer the Lake District?

12:38.761 --> 12:41.921
Well, this is beautiful It is.

12:42.001 --> 12:43.882
And to be honest, for me...

12:43.883 --> 12:46.281
More beautiful than Derwent water.

12:46.361 --> 12:49.081
Garda's not even the prettiest
lake and look at it.

12:49.241 --> 12:53.161
It's very lovely. Just scale
it down to 75% of that

12:53.241 --> 12:56.321
and then introduce a
bit of drizzle and...

12:56.401 --> 12:58.921
- Is Keswick in the Lake District?
- Ooh, yeah.

12:59.121 --> 13:02.641
What you don't get in Keswick
are these. Have you had one?

13:02.921 --> 13:05.561
- No.
- Have a pepper. Eat.

13:05.841 --> 13:08.401
Eat. Eat it. Go on,
you'll like it.

13:13.601 --> 13:14.601
I don't like it.

13:16.721 --> 13:19.681
Then we thought we'd
play our favourite game.

13:20.361 --> 13:23.121
He's got the Ferrari
options price list there

13:23.201 --> 13:25.081
and I'm going to guess
how much they cost.

13:25.601 --> 13:27.241
There are quite a Lot
of options available.

13:27.361 --> 13:28.601
Pick some.

13:28.681 --> 13:32.321
Okay. Racing seats
with carbon fibre.

13:33.681 --> 13:35.641
I don't know, 600 quid?

13:36.201 --> 13:38.241
£5,184.

13:38.321 --> 13:40.161
- I was a bit under.
- Yeah.

13:40.561 --> 13:44.641
But carbon fibre wheel caps, on
the tyres, you know, on the...

13:45.201 --> 13:46.321
- What, dust caps?
- Yeah.

13:47.481 --> 13:49.441
Carbon fibre dust caps? Tenner.

13:49.601 --> 13:51.081
£480. I thought that was cheap.

13:51.161 --> 13:53.081
- What, for four dust caps?
- Yeah.

13:53.161 --> 13:55.001
£480?

13:55.921 --> 13:57.481
Are the cup holders standard?

13:57.561 --> 13:59.801
There is a carbon fibre
cup holder you can get.

14:00.081 --> 14:02.841
- A carbon fibre cup holder?
- Yeah, you know, it pops in...

14:04.081 --> 14:07.481
Well, they were?600 on a
Lamborghini Gallardo a while back,

14:07.561 --> 14:09.281
so I'LL go a thousand.

14:09.361 --> 14:14.121
£2,112. Yeah, this is amazing.

14:14.401 --> 14:16.201
Really, the car is
the cheapest option.

14:30.241 --> 14:33.561
The next day, we consulted
a map and realised

14:33.721 --> 14:35.951
we were just a spit
from the fastest

14:35.952 --> 14:38.121
Grand Prix track
on the calendar...

14:41.401 --> 14:42.521
Monza.

14:43.881 --> 14:46.321
The Cathedral of Speed.

14:52.161 --> 14:53.761
Because it's so fast,

14:53.841 --> 14:56.041
I've ditched the Ferrari
and upped the ante

14:56.121 --> 14:58.201
to this Pagani Huayra,

14:58.281 --> 15:01.521
still a V12 but now
with two turbos.

15:01.601 --> 15:04.641
Because what you need
here is a missile.

15:05.161 --> 15:07.441
I've gone for a Porsche Cayman S.

15:07.561 --> 15:09.801
- You're just being obtuse.
- I'm not.

15:09.881 --> 15:11.201
You are. You've gone for a Porsche

15:11.281 --> 15:13.641
so you can not go for a
911. It's just annoying.

15:13.721 --> 15:14.761
This is better than a 911.

15:14.841 --> 15:16.361
It isn't. A 911 is
better than that.

15:16.362 --> 15:17.401
It isn't.

15:17.402 --> 15:18.941
Because the 911 has
its engine here.

15:18.942 --> 15:19.961
Yes.

15:19.962 --> 15:21.721
- This is mid-engine.
- Because it isn't a 911.

15:21.801 --> 15:22.881
- No.
- It's better.

15:22.961 --> 15:26.441
Listen, if we were driving around
Cadwell Park, Lydden Hill...

15:26.521 --> 15:28.561
- Yeah.
- Nippy and fizzy, yes.

15:28.641 --> 15:31.001
But not here at Monza.
You need power.

15:31.081 --> 15:32.521
You're just hung up on this

15:32.601 --> 15:34.761
- great big long straight.
- Yes.

15:34.841 --> 15:37.921
But there must be a corner
down there somewhere,

15:38.001 --> 15:39.801
otherwise you wouldn't be
able to get down there again.

15:39.881 --> 15:41.781
There has to be... In fact
there've got to be two corners.

15:41.782 --> 15:43.241
- Yes, genius, that's two corners.
- Yeah.

15:43.321 --> 15:44.681
Brilliant. Do you know what?

15:44.761 --> 15:48.361
The Pagani Huayra goes around
corners really incredibly well.

15:48.441 --> 15:51.121
You will not believe how fast
this goes around corners.

15:51.201 --> 15:52.961
- Okay.
- It's a lot better.

15:57.441 --> 15:59.441
If s true, I don't like Porches

15:59.601 --> 16:01.961
and I don't much like the
people who drive them,

16:02.041 --> 16:05.161
especially the ones
called James and Richard.

16:06.401 --> 16:09.281
I didn't much like the
original Cayman, either,

16:09.401 --> 16:10.761
I called it the Cockster.

16:12.601 --> 16:17.001
And there are one or two things
that I don't much like about this.

16:17.081 --> 16:21.681
The styling, for example, I
think it looks too like a 911.

16:22.121 --> 16:25.281
And then there's the seats, the
shoulder bolsters are too narrow.

16:25.361 --> 16:28.721
So, if you're broad-shouldered
and hunky, like me,

16:29.401 --> 16:31.641
you're getting sort of
squashed all the time.

16:33.121 --> 16:38.561
However, the rest of it
is absolutely sublime.

16:47.001 --> 16:50.841
You've got these adaptive dampers,
which means that it rides

16:52.081 --> 16:58.601
and handles and steers like
the very best supercars.

17:00.401 --> 17:05.641
But the best thing is the
engine. A 3.4-litre flat six.

17:06.401 --> 17:09.721
There's just no thing
about it that's wrong.

17:11.761 --> 17:13.881
And all the time it makes
this... You can hear that

17:13.961 --> 17:16.601
deep, reassuring noise,

17:16.681 --> 17:20.441
it's like having Richard
Burton in the boot,

17:20.601 --> 17:23.040
endlessly complimenting
you on your hair

17:23.121 --> 17:25.001
and your clothes and
your driving style.

17:29.441 --> 17:33.041
Oh, my God. That is so fast.

17:34.761 --> 17:36.081
Oh, my God.

17:37.161 --> 17:41.561
230, 240, 250,

17:42.081 --> 17:43.921
260 kilometres an hour.

17:44.201 --> 17:46.921
270. Oh, dear God.

17:49.281 --> 17:52.561
Oh. I scared the crap
out of myself then.

17:53.681 --> 17:55.241
Holy...

17:55.601 --> 17:57.041
Oh, my God.

18:01.241 --> 18:03.521
What a machine.

18:03.601 --> 18:06.201
Monza is all about speed

18:06.441 --> 18:10.361
and a Pagani Huayra is about
that and very little else.

18:11.321 --> 18:14.321
6.3-litre, v12, twin turbos.

18:15.481 --> 18:17.761
Truly, enormously powerful.

18:18.601 --> 18:21.521
Turning in, immense grip
from those fat tyres.

18:21.601 --> 18:26.161
I have aero, active aero keeping
me planted on the track.

18:27.121 --> 18:29.281
These things are built
to work as well,

18:29.282 --> 18:31.441
they're not some
fragile trailer queen.

18:31.521 --> 18:35.521
This car I'm in has
done 86,000 kilometres.

18:35.601 --> 18:38.761
And I'm guessing not many
of them were gentle.

18:40.201 --> 18:42.747
The Ferrari would've been good at

18:42.748 --> 18:45.601
this but not as
good as the Huayra.

18:49.521 --> 18:51.561
The problem is Hammond
is going too fast,

18:51.641 --> 18:56.601
he's not savouring this
glorious, historical tracks.

18:56.681 --> 19:00.561
He's just wolfing it down,
like a dog wolfs down a steak.

19:03.321 --> 19:07.841
What I'm doing is masticating,
enjoying every mouthful.

19:10.001 --> 19:13.281
As Jeremy crawled round
in his wrong car,

19:13.481 --> 19:16.401
I was waiting for him to
get back to the pits.

19:19.001 --> 19:20.641
He's going to be a
while, isn't he?

19:21.721 --> 19:25.281
While he's gone, let me show you
the interior of the Pagani.

19:27.641 --> 19:28.761
It's worth seeing.

19:29.201 --> 19:30.787
They want it to feel special in

19:30.788 --> 19:32.681
here and I think
they've succeeded.

19:34.681 --> 19:37.601
They've really put thought into
this, making it feel special.

19:38.561 --> 19:40.681
This gear linkage here,
all these parts,

19:40.761 --> 19:43.281
there's 67 components have
gone into making that

19:43.361 --> 19:46.321
in that skeleton form, so
you can see it working.

19:46.881 --> 19:48.721
And the materials,
too, it's all genuine,

19:48.801 --> 19:51.841
a lot of real carbon fibre, real
leather. And the aluminium,

19:51.921 --> 19:55.881
every single aluminium component
you can see in here isn't cast,

19:56.041 --> 19:58.493
it's milled from a single piece, a

19:58.494 --> 20:01.161
single billet, a
lump of aluminium.

20:02.161 --> 20:05.441
All of which means it feels
as expensive as it is.

20:06.201 --> 20:08.961
I like this car. He's
not back yet, is he?

20:10.641 --> 20:12.881
This is the only track
in the world with

20:12.882 --> 20:15.121
two lesbos, the first
one's quite tight,

20:15.441 --> 20:18.321
second one, though, you can
really hang your arse out

20:20.921 --> 20:21.921
There it is.

20:23.161 --> 20:27.401
It's 12 cylinders in total. Let's
count them, it'll pass the time.

20:27.721 --> 20:29.556
One, two... Oh, I'm going too

20:29.557 --> 20:31.961
quickly, might as
well make it last.

20:32.681 --> 20:36.201
Three... Oh, hang on. Oh.

20:40.001 --> 20:42.801
You must be feeling now...

20:42.881 --> 20:46.281
- What?
- That you brought the wrong car.

20:46.401 --> 20:49.801
Let me read you something, if
I may. Talking about this.

20:50.161 --> 20:53.121
"The car's cornering
balance is near perfect,

20:53.201 --> 20:55.398
"neutral but
unerringly predictable

20:55.399 --> 20:56.801
on a balanced throttle

20:57.001 --> 21:00.121
"and biased ever so
slightly towards understeer

21:00.401 --> 21:02.761
"if you throttle up
before you begin easing

21:02.841 --> 21:05.321
"the lateral load out
of the front tyres.

21:05.401 --> 21:08.841
Not my words, the words
of Autocar magazine.

21:09.001 --> 21:12.281
Wow. What do those
words actually mean?

21:12.361 --> 21:13.481
- I've no idea.
- Me, neither.

21:13.601 --> 21:16.521
But I'm going to go back out
there now and throttle up

21:16.601 --> 21:18.668
before I've eased the
lateral load out

21:18.669 --> 21:20.841
of the front tyres and
see what happens.

21:20.921 --> 21:22.561
- Yeah.
- That's what I'm going to do.

21:22.641 --> 21:25.121
I have no idea what any of
that means. I haven't a clue.

21:26.841 --> 21:28.841
Right. Throttle up.

21:29.241 --> 21:31.041
Oh, now you see?

21:31.201 --> 21:33.121
Now, that's just a spin.

21:35.201 --> 21:38.361
Now, you see, Autocar,
that's oversteer.

21:39.721 --> 21:41.694
Sometime you read
road tests and you

21:41.695 --> 21:43.561
do think, "What are you on about?"

21:43.841 --> 21:47.201
It's a really nice car and
you can get the arse out.

21:48.841 --> 21:49.881
Finally.

21:52.841 --> 21:55.161
- Still pretending to have fun?
- Yeah.

21:55.241 --> 21:57.681
- Will, will Poo be like this?
- Will what?

21:57.921 --> 21:59.161
Poo, when we go there.

21:59.441 --> 22:00.481
Oh, Pau?

22:00.561 --> 22:02.521
Do you know my favourite bit?

22:03.761 --> 22:04.841
- Yes. Yes.
- You could...

22:04.921 --> 22:07.801
The Porsche through there, it's
just a streak of lightning.

22:08.241 --> 22:10.161
Nothing is faster than that.

22:10.241 --> 22:12.601
Nothing is. Nothing's
faster... Or through there.

22:12.681 --> 22:14.681
Yes, you're getting
a bit carried away.

22:14.682 --> 22:16.481
It's fast. It's a
quick little car.

22:16.561 --> 22:19.441
To be honest, it's more
at home in this bit here.

22:19.721 --> 22:21.081
You could "Oh, look."
past the shops

22:21.161 --> 22:23.081
and "Oh, there's a school
and a supermarket."

22:23.161 --> 22:24.628
And that's really where
it belongs. Not here.

22:24.681 --> 22:25.921
- You're wrong.
- I'm not wrong.

22:26.001 --> 22:28.500
Hammond, I bet you
anything you like

22:28.501 --> 22:31.201
that around here the
Porsche is faster.

22:31.401 --> 22:32.401
Jeremy, that's...

22:32.681 --> 22:34.881
- Okay.
- Whoever loses has to say,

22:35.201 --> 22:36.881
"I love James May."

22:37.681 --> 22:39.841
They have to say that on
television to a camera.

22:40.681 --> 22:41.681
Fine.

22:41.761 --> 22:44.081
You actually have to go up to the
camera and go, "I love James May."

22:44.241 --> 22:46.601
All right. Well, I look forward
to hearing you say it.

22:47.881 --> 22:49.241
Oh, they're lesmos.

22:51.081 --> 22:54.201
I thought there was lesbo
one and... It's lesmo...

22:54.521 --> 22:56.161
Martin Brundle must
have had a cold.

23:01.481 --> 23:02.521
Right.

23:08.921 --> 23:09.921
And we are away.

23:15.961 --> 23:17.641
Oh, God. This is just embarrassing

23:17.721 --> 23:19.222
because where's going
to be my sense

23:19.223 --> 23:20.601
of achievement when I thrash him?

23:22.241 --> 23:23.601
There is a point with cars

23:23.681 --> 23:26.121
where they become so
powerful and so fast

23:26.721 --> 23:29.321
they become too hectic
and too frightening.

23:29.961 --> 23:32.481
That's the problem
with the... Huayra.

23:33.481 --> 23:36.601
Through the first of the lesmo
corners, as it turns out.

23:37.441 --> 23:39.281
I know it sounds silly
but once you go

23:39.361 --> 23:45.161
beyond 500-550 horsepower, you end
up driving the car more slowly.

23:46.201 --> 23:47.641
It's weird but it's true.

23:49.041 --> 23:51.761
Never has there beem a
more stark example of

23:51.841 --> 23:53.881
bringing a knife to a gunfight.

23:54.601 --> 23:58.161
The Porsche, around here, I'm
absolutely pinning it everywhere.

23:58.761 --> 24:01.121
It doesn't worry me, it's
not frightening, it's easy.

24:01.721 --> 24:03.281
That thing, though...

24:04.441 --> 24:05.521
Well, we shall see.

24:06.841 --> 24:10.561
My case will be proven and he will
be saying, "I love James May."

24:12.081 --> 24:14.081
That's 270 I saw there.

24:14.641 --> 24:16.321
He won't see anything like that.

24:16.681 --> 24:17.681
Oh.

24:18.081 --> 24:20.401
I hear the sound of an
approaching midget.

24:20.801 --> 24:21.961
Fully on the power.

24:22.161 --> 24:24.041
Ready, steady...

24:24.281 --> 24:25.841
And across the line.

24:32.001 --> 24:33.961
Two minutes, 14.8.

24:34.241 --> 24:35.601
We'll call it 2:15.

24:37.201 --> 24:39.561
Then it was the Cayman's turn.

24:47.681 --> 24:51.201
Really, I am taking
no pleasure in this.

24:51.681 --> 24:53.161
But he does need
to learn a lesson,

24:53.241 --> 24:55.641
that you can't just go making
stupid claims about a car

24:55.721 --> 24:56.801
just because you like it.

24:59.161 --> 25:02.561
No, seriously, that thing round...
I could be using an egg timer.

25:05.281 --> 25:08.601
How does he imagine he can
possibly make up enough time?

25:10.161 --> 25:11.961
No matter how good he
thinks he is in it.

25:12.041 --> 25:14.001
Clearly, it's not
going to... Anyway.

25:14.081 --> 25:16.001
- You what?
- Mate.

25:17.441 --> 25:19.441
Where... Why aren't you...

25:19.521 --> 25:21.281
I didn't say I'd be driving it.

25:21.361 --> 25:22.401
Well, who is?

25:22.481 --> 25:24.601
Well, some say it's
The Stig, and it is.

25:27.841 --> 25:29.921
Did you at any point say
I had to drive it? No.

25:30.001 --> 25:33.201
Did you at any point say you
were going to use The Stig?

25:33.281 --> 25:34.281
Why would you not?

25:36.921 --> 25:40.521
Because I think in every
possible definition,

25:40.601 --> 25:43.041
in every set of
rules, it's cheating.

25:46.801 --> 25:47.801
Oh, here he is.

25:50.001 --> 25:51.601
2:13:2.

25:51.801 --> 25:53.001
- 2:13:2.
- Yes.

25:53.081 --> 25:54.761
You were 2:14:8. So
he's one point...

25:55.201 --> 25:56.480
So, there you are, ladies and

25:56.481 --> 25:58.201
gentlemen, the Porsche
is, as I said,

25:58.281 --> 26:01.001
faster than the... Huayra.

26:01.161 --> 26:03.681
And therefore was a more
sensible choice of car.

26:03.761 --> 26:06.241
- No. The Stig is faster than me.
- What?

26:06.321 --> 26:07.908
But The Stig is
faster than everyone,

26:07.909 --> 26:09.161
that's the point of The Stig,

26:09.241 --> 26:11.121
if he wasn't he'd explode.

26:13.721 --> 26:16.801
As we left Monza in the
Mercedes and the Ferrari,

26:16.961 --> 26:18.761
the mood was glum.

26:21.801 --> 26:23.361
It's cheating.

26:26.681 --> 26:29.761
The next morning, however,
Hammond cheered up

26:29.841 --> 26:33.921
when he discovered the name of the
town where we'd stayed the night.

26:41.841 --> 26:43.801
From Bra to the French Riviera,

26:43.881 --> 26:45.681
we could've used the motorway.

26:45.761 --> 26:47.401
But we decided instead

26:47.481 --> 26:50.081
to use the finest switchback roads

26:50.161 --> 26:51.761
in the world.

26:51.841 --> 26:53.321
This meant ditching the Mercedes

26:53.401 --> 26:54.601
and the Ferrari

26:54.681 --> 26:56.721
and opting for these instead.

27:05.561 --> 27:07.241
On a road like this,

27:07.321 --> 27:10.721
you need something small,
you need a hot hatchback.

27:10.881 --> 27:12.761
And if you're going to
get a hot hatchback,

27:12.841 --> 27:15.081
why not get the king? This one.

27:15.721 --> 27:18.721
The Golf GTI.

27:25.081 --> 27:27.161
I loved the Mk1

27:27.241 --> 27:30.161
and the 16-valve Mk2
wasn't bad, either.

27:30.241 --> 27:32.521
But since then... I
mean, they weren't bad

27:32.721 --> 27:35.041
but the magic went missing.

27:35.121 --> 27:38.921
With this one, though,
the Mk7, it is back.

27:41.041 --> 27:42.921
This car can do everything.

27:43.001 --> 27:45.081
It's well made, it's
sensibly priced.

27:45.481 --> 27:47.921
It's economical,
it's well-equipped.

27:48.081 --> 27:50.521
It seats five, it's
got a big boot.

27:50.881 --> 27:53.121
But strip all that
away and underneath,

27:54.241 --> 27:56.801
its DNA is hot hatchery.

28:06.241 --> 28:09.601
Two-litre turbo engine,
220 horsepower

28:09.881 --> 28:11.401
and no torque steer.

28:11.481 --> 28:14.161
Now, watch this. Foot hard down,
going around a hairpin bend.

28:15.841 --> 28:17.441
It's just astonishing.

28:17.761 --> 28:20.561
The front diff on this
is beyond belief.

28:23.081 --> 28:25.041
Whoa. God, this is good.

28:31.681 --> 28:33.521
He's got it wrong again.

28:35.001 --> 28:37.441
The Golf GTI, it's
a brilliant car,

28:37.841 --> 28:40.161
it's probably the best
all-rounder in the world.

28:40.241 --> 28:41.561
But that's... That's the point,

28:41.641 --> 28:44.241
an all-rounder is exactly
what you don't need.

28:44.321 --> 28:46.801
An all-rounder is
inevitably compromised.

28:48.001 --> 28:50.681
I just want pure distilled
essence of hot hatch.

28:51.241 --> 28:53.641
And that means only
one thing right now.

28:53.721 --> 28:55.201
The Fiesta ST.

28:58.401 --> 29:01.921
When Ford put this car together,
they assembled all the right bits

29:02.001 --> 29:03.601
and thought, "Yeah, I
reckon that would be good."

29:03.681 --> 29:05.321
I don't think they could
possibly have known

29:05.761 --> 29:07.961
quite how good it was
going to turn out to be,

29:08.041 --> 29:10.121
because it's astonishing.

29:11.601 --> 29:14.121
It's down on power
compared to the Golf, yes.

29:14.201 --> 29:16.721
But it's smaller,
that's more hot hatch.

29:16.801 --> 29:17.921
And it's lighter,

29:18.001 --> 29:20.681
which means the power-to-weight
ratio is pretty much the same.

29:22.281 --> 29:24.281
And it's beyond nimble.

29:24.441 --> 29:26.601
You start to just take
liberties with it.

29:26.961 --> 29:29.241
Deliberately running a
line a little bit wide,

29:29.321 --> 29:31.761
so you get the pleasure
of turning it back in.

29:33.281 --> 29:34.481
It's superb.

29:37.001 --> 29:40.801
It's the biggest grin-maker I
think the world has ever seen.

29:41.881 --> 29:44.641
In the next village,
though, inevitably

29:44.721 --> 29:47.761
Jeremy decided we should
get something to eat.

29:52.801 --> 29:55.001
Why aren't you eating your lunch?

29:55.081 --> 29:56.201
I don't like pesto.

29:56.281 --> 29:58.361
- What?
- I don't like pesto.

29:58.441 --> 30:00.041
- Why not?
- It's just bits.

30:02.761 --> 30:06.721
There was, however, a very
good reason why we'd stopped.

30:07.241 --> 30:10.801
You've got to say it. You lost
the bet, you've got to say it.

30:10.881 --> 30:11.961
I'm not saying it.

30:12.041 --> 30:13.361
You've got to say it.

30:14.561 --> 30:17.561
I beat you fair and square.
The Porsche was faster.

30:17.641 --> 30:19.481
- It wasn't fair. You cheated.
- Say it.

30:21.081 --> 30:22.361
What?

30:24.041 --> 30:25.561
James May.

30:25.641 --> 30:29.041
- There.
- No. Say it so it's audible.

30:29.121 --> 30:30.881
I... love James May.

30:34.241 --> 30:37.041
With that done, we got
back in our cars.

30:38.561 --> 30:40.093
When you think of an American road

30:40.094 --> 30:41.761
trip, you think of
Monument Valley,

30:41.841 --> 30:44.641
that road spearing off
into the distance.

30:44.721 --> 30:48.601
Well, this is Europe's
equivalent of Monument Valley.

30:49.521 --> 30:51.881
This might just be my favourite
bit of our trip so far.

30:52.961 --> 30:54.201
The car, the place.

30:54.641 --> 30:55.681
This is perfect.

30:57.201 --> 31:00.121
When God was making
this part of the world,

31:00.201 --> 31:03.121
it was for hot hatchbacks.
That's what it's for.

31:05.481 --> 31:07.001
Unfortunately, however,

31:07.081 --> 31:09.481
our headlong charge down the Alps

31:09.561 --> 31:12.041
was halted because
we ran out of land.

31:25.921 --> 31:28.161
- That.
- What?

31:28.281 --> 31:31.641
Well, it's Monte-Carlo.
If we drive into there

31:31.721 --> 31:34.641
in a Volkswagen and a Ford,
they'll arrest us for vagrancy.

31:35.161 --> 31:36.201
That's a good point.

31:36.281 --> 31:37.606
I mean, you can be
an arms dealer...

31:37.607 --> 31:38.681
Yeah.

31:38.682 --> 31:40.281
But you can't drive
around in a Fiesta.

31:40.361 --> 31:42.028
- There's a limit.
- We're going to need to switch.

32:01.841 --> 32:04.841
For posing, these were
the cars we selected.

32:05.881 --> 32:08.881
A Lamborghini Aventador
Roadster for Hammond

32:10.481 --> 32:12.921
and a Bugatti Veyron for me.

32:14.521 --> 32:16.041
Now, this is no ordinary Veyron,

32:16.121 --> 32:19.321
this is the Grand Sport Vitesse.

32:19.401 --> 32:22.521
Eight-litre, quad-cam W16.

32:22.601 --> 32:26.041
Top speed 251 miles an hour

32:26.121 --> 32:27.601
with no roof.

32:29.121 --> 32:31.561
Here it is in its natural habitat.

32:33.641 --> 32:36.761
I'm in second gear. I'm
now using second gear

32:36.841 --> 32:39.321
for, well, the first
time since I set off.

32:40.241 --> 32:41.801
And back down to first.

32:45.721 --> 32:48.521
It is extraordinary
that here men get up

32:48.601 --> 32:50.921
from their bachelor
pads at about 10:00,

32:51.001 --> 32:53.088
get into their cars
that they bought

32:53.089 --> 32:55.401
using money they should
have paid in tax

32:55.801 --> 32:57.641
and then spend all day

32:57.721 --> 33:02.001
driving round and round
and round in circles.

33:02.561 --> 33:03.761
Why?

33:04.761 --> 33:07.721
People see me in my orange
Lamborghini Aventador Roadster

33:07.801 --> 33:11.601
and think, "Yes. There's a
man of potency and wealth."

33:12.041 --> 33:15.721
And then two seconds later,
they see that Bugatti Veyron

33:16.001 --> 33:18.601
and think, "There's a
richer, more powerful man."

33:19.361 --> 33:20.361
I'm sorry about this, mate,

33:20.441 --> 33:22.521
but once again, you're
in the wrong car.

33:23.241 --> 33:24.761
I take issue with the "once again"

33:24.841 --> 33:27.721
but, yes, for the first time,
I've got the wrong car.

33:29.401 --> 33:32.841
Nobody is looking at you, nobody.

33:32.921 --> 33:35.721
If I had spent?290,000

33:35.801 --> 33:38.041
on a Lamborghini to
drive around Monaco

33:38.121 --> 33:39.601
and you turned up in that,

33:39.681 --> 33:41.561
I'd just drive this into a wall.

33:45.281 --> 33:48.561
This is the snobbiest
place on earth.

33:49.281 --> 33:50.521
It makes...

33:51.281 --> 33:54.401
It makes Los Angeles
look like North Korea.

33:55.361 --> 33:56.961
And this snobbery is an issue

33:57.041 --> 33:59.761
when you try to get
your car valet parked.

34:07.601 --> 34:09.460
The problem is that chap has just

34:09.460 --> 34:11.601
turned up outside
the Hotel de Paris

34:11.681 --> 34:13.241
in a Ferrari California.

34:13.681 --> 34:15.081
The cheapest Ferrari there is.

34:15.161 --> 34:16.561
Nevertheless, he
likes it very much.

34:16.641 --> 34:19.081
Yeah, and it's nice. And
as a result, it's there.

34:19.161 --> 34:20.400
- Okay? Because it looks good.
- Yeah.

34:20.521 --> 34:21.761
But in a minute,

34:21.841 --> 34:25.521
a Kazakhstani arms dealer is
going to arrive in a nicer car

34:25.761 --> 34:27.960
and the Ferrari is
going to be taken away

34:28.241 --> 34:30.880
and put in a multi-storey on
the other side of Monaco.

34:30.960 --> 34:32.960
But we pull up there

34:33.041 --> 34:36.321
in a Bugatti Veyron and a
Lamborghini Aventador Roadster,

34:36.400 --> 34:39.281
are you're saying something better
is going to come along than that?

34:39.360 --> 34:40.721
In Monte-Carlo, I promise you,

34:40.801 --> 34:43.721
someone would turn up
in the USS Enterprise

34:43.801 --> 34:46.041
and our cars would be
in the multi-storey.

34:46.121 --> 34:49.081
It doesn't matter how
good your car is,

34:49.161 --> 34:51.920
the valet Parkers will
ultimately take it away

34:52.001 --> 34:54.960
because something
better always arrives.

34:55.041 --> 34:56.788
There's got to be a
way around this.

34:56.789 --> 34:58.441
This is the perfect motoring trip.

34:58.521 --> 35:00.721
So we go and check
in there, in a car,

35:00.801 --> 35:02.521
- on our perfect road trip...
- Yeah.

35:02.601 --> 35:04.168
We come out in the
morning, it's still there.

35:04.241 --> 35:05.681
That's our challenge.

35:06.321 --> 35:07.841
It's going to have to
be pretty special.

35:07.921 --> 35:09.041
Oh, yeah.

35:11.281 --> 35:12.881
Hammond, however, opted to go

35:12.961 --> 35:16.481
with one of the best-selling
cars the world has ever seen.

35:18.561 --> 35:20.521
A Model T Ford.

35:21.641 --> 35:23.561
And straight away
there was a problem.

35:24.001 --> 35:26.041
We didn't know how it worked.

35:26.561 --> 35:27.641
Right, now, look.

35:27.721 --> 35:28.921
Let's list the things.

35:29.001 --> 35:30.321
There are... There's three pedals.

35:30.401 --> 35:32.481
How do you... Where's the gear?
Is this the gear? That's...

35:32.561 --> 35:34.561
Oh, if it's... I haven't
got my foot on the clutch.

35:34.641 --> 35:35.941
- That isn't the clutch.
- Well, then...

35:36.441 --> 35:37.721
Which one's the accelerator?

35:37.801 --> 35:39.535
That's the accelerator. It
isn't a pedal, I'm sure...

35:39.561 --> 35:41.001
How am I going to get
my foot up there?

35:41.681 --> 35:44.001
- What's that do?
- Right, well, start it.

35:44.161 --> 35:46.361
That's not the starter.

35:48.441 --> 35:50.921
Eventually, Hammond
did make it begin.

35:51.321 --> 35:54.761
But then we learned he didn't
know how to make it stop.

35:56.001 --> 35:57.161
Oh, now what have I done?

35:57.841 --> 35:58.961
We're going faster.

35:59.041 --> 36:00.961
That's not the handbrake.
Stop it. Stop it.

36:01.241 --> 36:03.441
Stop it now.

36:07.961 --> 36:09.201
Right, forwards.

36:09.281 --> 36:10.681
- Hang on. Now, ready.
- Forwards.

36:11.441 --> 36:13.161
- That's not forwards.
- No, it's not at all, is it?

36:13.241 --> 36:14.641
Stop it. Make it stop.

36:14.721 --> 36:16.021
It doesn't really
want to, do you know?

36:16.022 --> 36:17.222
Make it stop.

36:18.401 --> 36:20.041
Jeremy, we've held up Monaco.

36:20.121 --> 36:21.601
- Have we?
- Look.

36:22.601 --> 36:23.721
Oh, God.

36:24.561 --> 36:27.481
Soon, however, we were
nearing our destination.

36:28.321 --> 36:30.121
It's not often I
say this, Hammond,

36:30.201 --> 36:31.761
but you have been a genius.

36:31.881 --> 36:32.881
You have never said that.

36:33.041 --> 36:35.721
Because if we can't drive this,

36:36.321 --> 36:40.441
what chance do the valet Parkers
at the Hotel de Paris have?

36:40.521 --> 36:42.241
None, it's the hardest
thing I've ever done.

36:42.521 --> 36:45.801
They'll want to move this
but they won't be able to.

36:47.521 --> 36:49.401
- Hello, Monsieur.
- Hello, sir.

36:50.281 --> 36:51.841
Shut it down.

36:54.121 --> 36:55.521
All yours.

36:56.001 --> 36:57.721
- Hello.
- Hello.

36:58.121 --> 36:59.161
Hello.

37:01.441 --> 37:04.881
So, would the valet
staff be successful?

37:30.281 --> 37:31.401
No.

37:35.841 --> 37:38.841
So, there we go. That is how
to beat the valet Parkers.

37:39.241 --> 37:41.761
Buy a car they can't drive.

37:41.961 --> 37:43.681
Yes, but the problem is

37:43.761 --> 37:46.361
today we are going

37:46.441 --> 37:48.921
down the French Riviera
to Saint-Tropez

37:49.001 --> 37:51.201
and I'm not sure

37:51.281 --> 37:52.801
I want to go in that.

37:52.881 --> 37:55.241
I'm not sure I'd actually
go anywhere in It.

38:04.961 --> 38:07.401
This is a Jaguar E-Type.

38:07.761 --> 38:10.641
It's a 1962 Series 1 Roadster

38:10.841 --> 38:13.721
with the proper
3.8-litre straight six.

38:19.441 --> 38:22.201
And it's not just any 1962 E-Type.

38:23.161 --> 38:24.201
It's mine.

38:29.201 --> 38:31.761
And I can think of no car

38:31.841 --> 38:34.361
more perfect for a day like today.

38:35.521 --> 38:37.281
Oh, I can.

38:37.881 --> 38:40.201
Because I am in a V8 F-Type.

38:46.961 --> 38:49.881
This is faster than
Hammond's E-Type.

38:49.961 --> 38:53.001
It's more comfortable, more
economical, more reliable,

38:53.081 --> 38:54.641
more air-conditioned

38:54.721 --> 38:58.041
And even though it costs?86,000,

38:58.401 --> 38:59.441
it's cheaper.

39:02.841 --> 39:04.041
Wake up, Frenchies.

39:05.801 --> 39:07.441
Oh, that's a racket.

39:12.681 --> 39:14.681
Can you hear the exhausts
from back there?

39:15.801 --> 39:17.721
They can hear them back in Venice.

39:24.201 --> 39:27.284
Never has a car
been more perfectly

39:27.285 --> 39:29.681
tailored to its environment

39:29.801 --> 39:31.161
than this is here.

39:31.921 --> 39:35.121
This is where the
jetset was invented.

39:39.641 --> 39:42.441
We are in Jag country,
I can feel it.

39:46.401 --> 39:50.041
Not a restaurant bill will have
been paid around here for decades.

39:50.441 --> 39:52.961
Just Jaguar tyre marks where
they've screeched away.

39:53.041 --> 39:55.161
"I'm sorry. I'll pop off
and get my wallet."

39:57.841 --> 40:01.121
There used to be a TV
series in the '70s

40:01.201 --> 40:05.161
called The Persuaders. With
Roger Moore and Tony Curtis.

40:06.401 --> 40:08.721
And I'm hearing that music now.

40:19.561 --> 40:21.281
Roger Moore, Tony Curtis,

40:21.481 --> 40:23.881
whizzing about down
here in a Ferrari Dino

40:23.961 --> 40:26.001
and an Aston Martin DBS,

40:26.081 --> 40:27.681
solving many things,

40:29.281 --> 40:32.121
punching men and saving women.

40:35.121 --> 40:38.401
I was enjoying it too. Until...

40:38.761 --> 40:41.441
Hammond, the Picasso
museum's along here.

40:41.721 --> 40:42.881
We could stop and have a look.

40:44.041 --> 40:46.241
Really? I'm in a Jaguar,

40:46.321 --> 40:48.601
my E-Type, in the south of France,

40:48.681 --> 40:50.681
and you want me stop
driving to look at a man

40:50.761 --> 40:52.601
whose ears are in the wrong place?

40:52.881 --> 40:54.201
No, that was Van Gogh.

40:54.601 --> 40:56.361
Picasso's the one who puts eyes

40:56.441 --> 40:58.481
on the wrong side
of somebody's head.

40:58.761 --> 41:01.921
Come on, it's a road trip.
Let's look at some pictures.

41:02.561 --> 41:04.921
Did you not hear
what you just said?

41:05.001 --> 41:07.481
"It's a road trip. Let's
look at some pictures."

41:07.561 --> 41:08.601
No.

41:11.001 --> 41:13.921
Oh, why are you so uncultured?

41:19.641 --> 41:22.001
In Juan-Les-Pins, where
all the girls have

41:22.081 --> 41:24.081
carefully designed
topless swimsuits

41:24.161 --> 41:26.761
and racehorses they
keep just for fun,

41:26.961 --> 41:29.281
for a laugh, a-ha-ha.

41:29.361 --> 41:32.761
We pulled over so Hammond
could look at some food.

41:36.361 --> 41:39.321
- What now?
- I don't like octopus.

41:39.801 --> 41:41.281
What's the matter with it?

41:41.361 --> 41:42.495
- Well...
- Do you want my truffles

41:42.496 --> 41:43.496
on an omelette?

41:43.561 --> 41:46.881
Don't like truffles. You are
ruining this trip for me.

41:47.641 --> 41:48.908
- Go on.
- Every time we stop for food,

41:48.909 --> 41:50.441
- you make me eat octopus...
- It's nice.

41:50.521 --> 41:52.721
Or crab's eyes or snail's legs.

41:53.001 --> 41:56.001
And then every time we get going
again, you make us stop again

41:56.281 --> 41:59.601
to Look at a pile of bricks and
then that balcony from a story.

41:59.681 --> 42:01.761
It's a road trip.

42:01.841 --> 42:04.121
We're supposed to be seeing...
Look what I've brought you to.

42:04.201 --> 42:05.481
On the road.

42:05.561 --> 42:08.401
I've brought you to one of
my favourite restaurants.

42:08.921 --> 42:10.270
A table for two by
the waterside...

42:10.271 --> 42:11.341
It's not...

42:11.342 --> 42:12.441
Eat it.

42:12.521 --> 42:14.921
- Not an eating trip, is it?
- Eat it.

42:15.561 --> 42:17.921
- Eat the octopus.
- It moved.

42:18.001 --> 42:20.681
It didn't. It's only
one of its legs.

42:21.921 --> 42:23.121
I...

42:23.201 --> 42:24.681
Would you like to stop
at a service station

42:24.761 --> 42:26.281
and get some crisps?

42:30.241 --> 42:33.121
After lunch, we went for a
stroll along the seafront

42:33.201 --> 42:34.721
to look at the sights.

42:34.801 --> 42:36.961
But because this is a family show,

42:37.041 --> 42:40.161
we can't show you what
those sights were.

42:53.481 --> 42:57.321
Eventually, though, our ice
creams melted completely

42:57.401 --> 42:58.841
so we set off.

43:06.761 --> 43:10.001
You know we were talking
about the perfect road trip?

43:17.561 --> 43:20.361
How wrong would the Lamborghini
and Bugatti have been here?

43:21.801 --> 43:23.401
Or the Ford Fiesta.

43:23.481 --> 43:25.041
Yeah.

43:34.561 --> 43:37.561
The problem is that when we
arrived in Saint-Raphael,

43:37.641 --> 43:39.481
the traffic was predictable.

43:40.281 --> 43:42.201
And so was the E-Type.

43:46.241 --> 43:48.561
Hammond's car is sounding poorly.

43:49.401 --> 43:50.601
Oh, God.

43:52.321 --> 43:55.801
Will it be able to do the
traffic jam into Saint-Tropez?

43:58.001 --> 43:59.561
I'm honestly... I'm really...

44:00.161 --> 44:02.481
I am worried about her,
actually, I really am.

44:05.721 --> 44:06.801
Are you?

44:09.161 --> 44:10.761
Oh, God, that doesn't sound right.

44:11.721 --> 44:13.801
The sound of Britain in the '60s.

44:13.881 --> 44:16.201
Ding-ding-ding-ding-ding...

44:16.681 --> 44:18.641
"Made in the Midlands with pride.

44:19.281 --> 44:21.097
"Ah, we've really
put this together

44:21.098 --> 44:22.761
very nicely, we have, very nice.

44:23.281 --> 44:25.481
"Done a good job with
that E-Type, we have."

44:28.881 --> 44:31.681
Ow, dipstick's too
hot, can't touch that.

44:33.081 --> 44:34.321
- Oh.
- Richard.

44:34.441 --> 44:35.841
- What?
- I've bought you something

44:35.961 --> 44:36.961
to cheer you up.

44:37.201 --> 44:38.921
- Have you?
- It's a little present.

44:39.001 --> 44:40.041
Is it?

44:40.681 --> 44:42.161
It's a fishing net.

44:42.801 --> 44:45.161
I know it's not the
same as an E-Type

44:45.241 --> 44:47.681
but now this doesn't work any
more, you can have that.

44:48.721 --> 44:50.361
Thank you for my fishing net.

44:50.641 --> 44:53.961
It's three Euros, which is
more than this is worth.

44:54.041 --> 44:55.121
Now.

44:55.801 --> 44:58.161
I then had an idea.

44:59.441 --> 45:01.961
We'll have a race from
here to Saint-Tropez

45:02.041 --> 45:03.401
but we'll stay the night, yes?

45:03.481 --> 45:04.881
- A race.
- What...

45:04.961 --> 45:06.121
No.

45:06.361 --> 45:07.641
- Ditch these.
- Ditch the Jags.

45:07.721 --> 45:08.761
You've got no choice.

45:09.241 --> 45:11.561
What's that new hotel
called? Hotel de Paris.

45:11.841 --> 45:13.481
- It's got a rooftop bar.
- Okay.

45:14.601 --> 45:16.161
Last one there

45:17.681 --> 45:21.161
has to wear an "I love
James May" T-shirt

45:21.641 --> 45:24.361
tomorrow, all day.

45:24.441 --> 45:27.201
That's quite a forfeit but...

45:27.281 --> 45:28.281
Yeah.

45:33.001 --> 45:37.001
I have had such a brilliant idea

45:37.561 --> 45:40.241
that Clarkson has had it.

45:43.161 --> 45:46.201
Because I am going to
Saint-Tropez on this.

45:49.521 --> 45:51.001
The Ducati Diavel.

45:52.401 --> 45:53.481
Dark.

45:57.321 --> 45:58.721
- Are you ready, Hammond?
- Yeah.

46:01.081 --> 46:02.321
In three,

46:02.401 --> 46:04.161
two, one...

46:04.241 --> 46:05.481
Go.

46:10.761 --> 46:12.201
All right.

46:27.081 --> 46:29.801
I chose this bike for
a very good reason.

46:30.641 --> 46:33.001
The engine, 1200cc V-twin,

46:33.361 --> 46:36.201
taken from a Ducati
sports bike, the 1198.

46:36.281 --> 46:40.161
And Ducati, trust me, know a thing
or two about making fast bikes.

46:40.521 --> 46:43.721
162 brake horsepower,
the UK edition.

46:43.801 --> 46:45.401
Restricted in France to 100.

46:45.481 --> 46:46.641
But you know what?

46:46.721 --> 46:49.201
That's still going to be plenty
for what I want to do today.

46:49.961 --> 46:51.681
Top speed about 170,

46:51.761 --> 46:53.761
0-60 about two and a half,

46:53.841 --> 46:56.521
you know, the same
as a Bugatti Veyron.

47:00.561 --> 47:02.081
Traffic, you see?

47:02.481 --> 47:03.961
How's he going to
get to even this?

47:04.201 --> 47:05.921
He's never even going
to get out of town.

47:06.521 --> 47:09.361
I Look cooL. It goes
Like the clappers.

47:09.441 --> 47:11.401
Clarkson's had it here.

47:11.481 --> 47:13.481
There you go. See that? Clear.

47:20.121 --> 47:21.481
Hello.

47:21.561 --> 47:24.761
You join me on a
Fairline Squadron 78.

47:27.521 --> 47:29.561
That's 78 feet long.

47:31.361 --> 47:34.241
The engines in this
thing are unbelievable,

47:34.841 --> 47:39.201
32-litre, twin turbocharged V12s.

47:40.201 --> 47:41.241
Here we go.

47:57.361 --> 47:58.721
And you can drive it like this.

48:00.281 --> 48:01.441
Or like that.

48:04.361 --> 48:05.601
And because it's a boat

48:05.681 --> 48:08.401
I could get to Saint-Tropez
across the bay.

48:11.361 --> 48:14.921
Whereas Hammond had to
go all the way round it.

48:17.601 --> 48:20.241
Sneaking through,
sneaking through, just.

48:21.121 --> 48:22.601
Every car counts.

48:22.681 --> 48:25.081
Any one of these
could be Clarkson.

48:26.321 --> 48:27.481
Where is he?

48:28.281 --> 48:29.361
If I have been past him,

48:29.441 --> 48:31.341
he would have been looking at
my bottom in leather, going,

48:31.342 --> 48:33.862
"Oh, look, a man's bottom in
leather." He's obsessed with it.

48:39.681 --> 48:42.041
I don't know what Richard
Hammond is using,

48:42.121 --> 48:43.561
but I'm guessing

48:43.801 --> 48:45.801
it's a motorcycle of some sort.

48:45.881 --> 48:49.081
So he'll be dressed from
head to foot in leather,

48:49.161 --> 48:50.681
furious at the traffic,

48:50.761 --> 48:53.161
with his bottom...

48:53.241 --> 48:55.601
"Look at me, I'm on a motorbike.

48:55.681 --> 48:58.761
"I'm straddling a
throbbing machine."

49:00.001 --> 49:01.281
I'm not doing any of that.

49:03.681 --> 49:05.974
Got the satnav down
here to bring us

49:05.975 --> 49:08.081
onto the bearing of Saint-Tropez.

49:11.601 --> 49:13.321
I'm just going to take
it up a little bit more,

49:13.401 --> 49:15.721
2,300 rpm a side.

49:17.401 --> 49:20.641
Look at this. Look at this now.

49:24.001 --> 49:25.881
Eat my diesel, Hammond.

49:34.601 --> 49:36.841
I just want to come round
one of these corners

49:36.921 --> 49:39.361
and see a McLaren 12C.

49:39.761 --> 49:43.201
Or an SLS Black.

49:47.041 --> 49:49.961
And he will be stuck.
And I will pass him.

49:50.321 --> 49:52.761
And I will ask him, "Bikes.

49:52.841 --> 49:54.681
"Still no good?"

49:59.681 --> 50:01.801
Anyone fancy a drink in the crew?

50:02.361 --> 50:03.601
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

50:04.761 --> 50:06.241
Excuse me.

50:06.721 --> 50:07.801
Thanks very much.

50:14.001 --> 50:16.361
Standing traffic.
Standing traffic.

50:16.441 --> 50:18.921
Come on, Clarkson, where are you?

50:20.121 --> 50:22.481
As long as nobody opens their
door or suddenly turns left,

50:23.041 --> 50:25.721
I can just keep hacking
through it like this.

50:26.001 --> 50:28.961
Oh, there you go.
That's the door open.

50:29.041 --> 50:30.081
That's the one.

50:30.801 --> 50:33.041
That's the fella.
There's always one.

50:34.921 --> 50:36.279
He's going to be in
any one of these.

50:36.280 --> 50:37.601
Any minute now I'm
going to see him.

50:38.801 --> 50:40.441
This has got to be him.

50:40.921 --> 50:42.961
Ladies and gentlemen,
hello, Jeremy Clarkson.

50:44.481 --> 50:45.961
No. That's not him.

50:50.321 --> 50:52.321
With the Squadron at full chat

50:52.401 --> 50:55.121
and Saint-Tropez
very close indeed,

50:55.201 --> 50:57.521
life on the boat was good.

51:01.361 --> 51:02.921
Grunt.

51:05.201 --> 51:06.321
This is more like it.

51:06.801 --> 51:08.241
Getting a proper move on.

51:09.521 --> 51:12.601
Having cleared the worst of
the Saint-Raphael traffic,

51:12.681 --> 51:16.121
I was now on the open
road and closing fast.

51:18.121 --> 51:19.881
Okay, there is, I'll be honest,

51:20.201 --> 51:21.681
a tiny, tiny chance

51:21.761 --> 51:23.961
he got through all of that
traffic and out of town

51:24.401 --> 51:26.201
and then caned it along here

51:26.561 --> 51:28.121
and I simply haven't
caught him yet.

51:28.201 --> 51:30.041
But I've got a good suspicion

51:30.121 --> 51:31.881
when we get to Saint-Tropez,

51:31.961 --> 51:34.601
there'll be more traffic and
that is where I'll find him.

51:37.881 --> 51:42.561
I'm about to park my 78-foot
boat in Saint-Tropez harbour.

51:45.281 --> 51:46.601
This is the only slow bit,

51:46.681 --> 51:49.561
the wobbling about in
Saint-Tropez harbour.

51:49.641 --> 51:51.561
Because they've got some
stupid speed limit.

51:55.441 --> 51:57.641
Oh, good God, Look at this.

51:58.361 --> 52:01.801
Traffic. That's a big jam.

52:02.681 --> 52:04.121
Oh.

52:05.681 --> 52:07.961
Squeezing through, coming
through, coming through.

52:09.201 --> 52:10.801
As Hammond weaved his way

52:10.881 --> 52:13.401
through the annual
Saint-Tropez traffic jam...

52:14.521 --> 52:16.361
Oh, my God.

52:19.761 --> 52:23.001
I was still waiting to be
given a parking space.

52:31.321 --> 52:33.641
Through, coming through,
coming through.

52:40.481 --> 52:42.721
Hotel de Paris, I thank you.

52:56.481 --> 52:57.601
Mate.

52:58.041 --> 52:59.281
How are you?

53:00.001 --> 53:01.081
How...

53:02.761 --> 53:04.081
God, you look sticky.

53:04.601 --> 53:07.081
How the bloody hell?

53:07.361 --> 53:10.041
I didn't see you. I
didn't see you once.

53:10.121 --> 53:12.121
I saw a Ferrari F12, I
thought it was you.

53:12.881 --> 53:14.041
Thing is

53:14.121 --> 53:17.281
you've got a motorcycle licence.

53:17.841 --> 53:20.081
- Yes.
- Well, now, I have

53:20.161 --> 53:21.721
a boat Licence.

53:22.521 --> 53:25.241
And what this means, of
course, is tomorrow,

53:25.681 --> 53:27.921
while you'll be wearing a T-shirt
and that'll be cooler...

53:28.001 --> 53:29.041
Ah, I forgot about that.

53:29.121 --> 53:32.601
It will say "I love
James May" on it.

53:41.281 --> 53:43.561
The next morning,
Hammond was in no hurry

53:43.641 --> 53:45.321
to leave the hotel.

53:48.401 --> 53:50.121
- Hammond.
- What?

53:50.201 --> 53:52.081
- Hammond, come out.
- No.

53:52.841 --> 53:54.681
No, I'm a bit... I haven't...
I'm just packing my bag.

53:54.761 --> 53:57.441
- It's quarter to 9:00.
- Yeah, I'm just packing my bag.

53:57.521 --> 53:58.761
I'm packing.

53:59.601 --> 54:01.241
Actually, no, I'm not very well.

54:01.321 --> 54:02.481
There's nobody here.

54:02.561 --> 54:04.241
- I'm poorly.
- Hammond.

54:04.801 --> 54:06.281
Right. I'm coming out.

54:12.361 --> 54:13.561
Ooh.

54:14.241 --> 54:15.881
Now, look.

54:15.961 --> 54:17.641
- This is bad.
- Yes.

54:17.921 --> 54:20.081
But I'm afraid the
news gets even worse.

54:20.161 --> 54:21.561
It can't be any worse.

54:21.721 --> 54:23.441
We've both chosen the same car.

54:24.281 --> 54:26.081
Well, that's not so bad, is it?

54:35.481 --> 54:37.761
- You mean there's only one?
- Yes.

54:39.921 --> 54:41.681
So, Saint-Tropez,

54:41.921 --> 54:44.481
convertible Bentley, two men.

54:48.361 --> 54:49.761
Oh, we are looking...

54:51.161 --> 54:52.321
Just realised.

54:53.081 --> 54:55.201
Two men in a Bentley.

54:56.681 --> 54:59.601
It isn't just the Bentley,
we ought to make that plain.

54:59.961 --> 55:02.001
It's any convertible.

55:02.081 --> 55:05.041
Put two men in a convertible car,

55:05.361 --> 55:09.321
take the roof off and instantly,
questions are raised.

55:13.201 --> 55:17.081
Still, at least in the car,
they couldn't see my T-shirt.

55:17.481 --> 55:18.481
Until...

55:18.561 --> 55:19.761
Why are you pulling over here?

55:19.841 --> 55:21.175
I just want to have a
look at something.

55:21.176 --> 55:22.401
- What?
- Just stuff.

55:22.481 --> 55:23.531
What stuff?

55:23.532 --> 55:24.881
Just... I want to
look at the boats.

55:24.961 --> 55:25.961
What are you doing?

55:26.041 --> 55:27.801
- It's a nice place.
- I don't want to stop.

55:27.881 --> 55:29.961
- There's people...
- Just get out.

55:30.041 --> 55:31.201
- No.
- Yes.

55:31.281 --> 55:32.401
- No.
- Yes.

55:32.481 --> 55:33.961
No, I'm going to hide.

55:34.041 --> 55:35.881
I'm not getting out.
I'm getting in here.

55:37.241 --> 55:38.401
I'm on my own.

55:44.001 --> 55:45.481
Oh, God.

55:46.161 --> 55:48.601
I'm just going to go for
a walk and leave him.

55:51.641 --> 55:53.081
Make this end.

56:04.921 --> 56:06.481
I Lost a bet.

56:08.481 --> 56:09.841
Oh, God.

56:11.921 --> 56:13.761
Jeremy, can we go now?

56:14.281 --> 56:15.441
No.

56:16.041 --> 56:17.561
Do any of these boats
have propellers

56:17.641 --> 56:19.921
and are any of them likely
to be running right now?

56:20.841 --> 56:22.721
Paparazzi again. There's
quite a lot of paps here.

56:22.801 --> 56:24.521
Yeah. So let's go.

56:25.641 --> 56:27.921
There was, however,
a small problem.

56:31.001 --> 56:33.001
Was it... Is this where it was?

56:33.081 --> 56:35.001
- Yes.
- Well, it's not, is it?

56:37.841 --> 56:39.121
I tell you why it's not.

56:39.201 --> 56:41.041
You can't park here, can you?

56:41.121 --> 56:43.881
Can you park here? Are
you allowed to... What?

56:45.001 --> 56:47.135
No, you can't park here or that's
a picture of a car being towed.

56:47.136 --> 56:50.256
- Do you know, I genuinely...
- Has the car been towed away?

56:50.561 --> 56:51.761
Well, yes.

56:52.841 --> 56:54.241
Just you wait here

56:54.321 --> 56:55.321
and I'LL go get it.

56:55.401 --> 56:57.241
- Just relax.
- Yeah.

56:57.321 --> 56:59.521
It's not far, actually,
I'll be back in an hour.

57:03.641 --> 57:07.321
I'm sure somebody somewhere at
some time has been unhappier.

57:14.001 --> 57:16.601
Please, please, please, please.

57:19.001 --> 57:21.081
No, not funny. Not
even halfway funny.

57:22.281 --> 57:23.961
Open the damn door.
Jeremy, open the door.

57:25.161 --> 57:26.361
How do you do that?

57:26.641 --> 57:27.801
I'm getting in.

57:31.361 --> 57:33.241
Now, at this point
you may be wondering

57:33.321 --> 57:35.641
why both of us chose a Bentley.

57:36.041 --> 57:40.081
Well, partly it's because we think
that these days, it looks good.

57:40.521 --> 57:42.721
But mostly it's because
it's now available

57:42.801 --> 57:46.761
with a brilliant lighter,
louder 4-litre V8.

57:48.041 --> 57:50.681
Not that this was foremost
in Hammond's mind.

57:51.801 --> 57:53.281
- Jeremy Clarkson.
- Yes.

57:53.841 --> 57:55.721
Have you put my seat
heater on full?

57:55.801 --> 57:57.921
Yes, I have.

57:58.001 --> 57:59.001
Oh, mate, that's...

57:59.081 --> 58:01.281
- Yes. Result.
- Oh.

58:01.361 --> 58:02.641
Just horrific.

58:02.721 --> 58:04.761
- That's a result right there.
- Oh.

58:05.641 --> 58:07.481
Then I got another result.

58:07.561 --> 58:09.681
A clear, open road.

58:16.801 --> 58:18.561
"It's got a bit of poke."

58:23.321 --> 58:25.641
- Whoa.
- Oh, that's how it should sound.

58:28.801 --> 58:29.841
Do you know what it feels like?

58:31.081 --> 58:33.081
- An sportscar.
- It does.

58:38.241 --> 58:39.641
Have you put my seat heater on?

58:40.001 --> 58:41.041
Yes, I have.

58:42.801 --> 58:44.481
I'm really sor...

58:50.801 --> 58:52.161
It's a machine, this.

58:52.761 --> 58:55.121
Hello, machine.

59:00.161 --> 59:02.401
One of the reasons why I
like this car so much,

59:02.681 --> 59:05.721
you know it isn't
just a Bentley badge,

59:05.801 --> 59:07.390
there's some properly difficult

59:07.391 --> 59:09.441
engineering that's
gone into this car.

59:12.001 --> 59:14.281
Jeremy, have you put my seat
heater on again? You...

59:14.361 --> 59:16.921
That's not... I...

59:18.241 --> 59:19.281
Oh.

59:19.361 --> 59:22.081
And if I lift myself up, they
can see my T-shirt better

59:22.161 --> 59:24.961
and if I sit down, I cook. God.

59:29.841 --> 59:31.401
So, clever engine,

59:31.481 --> 59:33.281
clever four-wheel-drive system,

59:33.361 --> 59:35.241
looks a lot better these days.

59:35.321 --> 59:36.401
Great noise.

59:37.521 --> 59:38.601
Great noise.

59:38.681 --> 59:40.081
It's a great car.

59:40.161 --> 59:43.761
The problem it has still
is that Rooney flavour.

59:44.161 --> 59:46.161
The whiff of Wayne means

59:47.041 --> 59:49.481
you do feel embarrassed
to turn up in it.

59:50.161 --> 59:51.361
Hammond.

59:52.241 --> 59:55.641
Stop putting my seat heater on.

59:58.361 --> 01:00:02.001
Soon, despite the hot seats,
the hot car and the hot sun,

01:00:02.561 --> 01:00:04.801
the atmosphere became frosty.

01:00:09.441 --> 01:00:11.961
So we decided to split up.

01:00:26.441 --> 01:00:28.230
And then I decided to look at a

01:00:28.231 --> 01:00:30.481
building that had
mostly fallen over.

01:00:37.121 --> 01:00:38.121
Look at this.

01:00:39.161 --> 01:00:41.361
Yes, look, there's a
wild boar, there we are.

01:00:41.521 --> 01:00:43.121
This is a hunting scene.

01:00:44.241 --> 01:00:46.281
Hammond, there's a hunting scene.

01:00:47.161 --> 01:00:48.161
Hammond.

01:00:48.721 --> 01:00:50.761
It's like there's a mausoleum

01:00:50.841 --> 01:00:55.161
- and a sort of triumphal arch.
- Don't talk to me, I don't care.

01:00:55.241 --> 01:00:56.373
I don't want to hear about it. I

01:00:56.374 --> 01:00:57.681
don't want to know,
I really don't.

01:00:57.761 --> 01:00:58.761
I'm sick of it.

01:00:58.961 --> 01:01:01.801
This is ridiculous.
I've eaten crab's eyes,

01:01:01.881 --> 01:01:03.212
I've looked at a balcony from a

01:01:03.213 --> 01:01:04.801
story. No, seriously,
it's my turn.

01:01:05.281 --> 01:01:06.961
It's my turn to decide
what we do next.

01:01:07.041 --> 01:01:09.521
And what we're doing next
is going rally driving.

01:01:10.041 --> 01:01:11.541
What, in a Maserati Quattroporte?

01:01:11.542 --> 01:01:12.542
No.

01:01:12.543 --> 01:01:13.761
- And a Rolls-Royce Phantom?
- No.

01:01:13.841 --> 01:01:14.841
I've had a good idea.

01:01:20.001 --> 01:01:22.441
This is the circuit Sambre,

01:01:23.561 --> 01:01:27.401
endless kilometres of
unrelenting French rally stage.

01:01:29.961 --> 01:01:32.561
And a place The Stig knows well.

01:01:35.961 --> 01:01:37.561
- What?
- Well,

01:01:37.641 --> 01:01:39.441
this is The Stig's
summer retreat, yeah?

01:01:39.521 --> 01:01:41.601
He comes here every
year and does that.

01:01:41.961 --> 01:01:44.081
- And he says...
- What do you mean, he does that?

01:01:44.321 --> 01:01:46.641
Well, in winter he goes ice
racing. Summer, he comes here.

01:01:46.721 --> 01:01:48.001
Three weeks of that he does.

01:01:48.281 --> 01:01:49.281
What, non-stop?

01:01:49.282 --> 01:01:51.121
Yeah, gets in the
car, three weeks,

01:01:51.201 --> 01:01:53.841
and then three weeks later,
gets out, goes home.

01:01:53.921 --> 01:01:56.641
That's his holiday. Anyway,
he says we could use it

01:01:56.721 --> 01:01:57.921
to do our rally driving.

01:01:58.001 --> 01:01:59.281
- It's too hot.
- Dah.

01:01:59.641 --> 01:02:00.841
I have actually thought of that.

01:02:01.161 --> 01:02:02.751
You like a convertible, don't you?

01:02:02.752 --> 01:02:03.752
Yeah.

01:02:03.761 --> 01:02:06.841
Why don't we rally-drive
convertibles?

01:02:07.001 --> 01:02:09.281
- It's too dusty.
- Now, do one thing for me,

01:02:09.361 --> 01:02:11.081
we're going to go and
get some convertibles,

01:02:11.761 --> 01:02:13.601
turn them into rally
cars and do that.

01:02:14.041 --> 01:02:15.481
I can't do rally driving.

01:02:15.761 --> 01:02:17.641
- It's easy, just...
- I can't.

01:02:17.721 --> 01:02:19.081
I can't drive on loose surfaces...

01:02:23.681 --> 01:02:25.521
This is what I've got.

01:02:25.601 --> 01:02:27.841
Nissan 350Z.

01:02:30.321 --> 01:02:31.601
Three-and-a-half-litre V6,

01:02:31.681 --> 01:02:34.761
276 brake horsepower,
rear-wheel drive.

01:02:36.841 --> 01:02:38.601
Now, you might be looking
at it, thinking, "Well,

01:02:39.201 --> 01:02:40.881
"it doesn't look much
like a rally car."

01:02:41.281 --> 01:02:44.001
But hold on, this car
is a direct descendant

01:02:44.081 --> 01:02:45.721
of the Datsun 240Z,

01:02:45.801 --> 01:02:48.441
a car that owned world rallying.

01:02:48.521 --> 01:02:50.881
So this has got history.

01:02:51.521 --> 01:02:52.961
It's going to be brilliant.

01:02:59.841 --> 01:03:00.881
I've got a BMW.

01:03:02.041 --> 01:03:05.081
No history of rallying at all,
it's one of the reasons I like it.

01:03:05.201 --> 01:03:07.035
Well, come on, tell us about
it, what engine has it got?

01:03:07.081 --> 01:03:08.681
Two-and-a-half-litre straight 6.

01:03:08.761 --> 01:03:10.921
1000cc less than
the Nissan. Power?

01:03:11.601 --> 01:03:13.281
192?

01:03:13.521 --> 01:03:15.521
That's about 80
horsepower less. Torque?

01:03:16.081 --> 01:03:17.081
180.

01:03:17.161 --> 01:03:19.481
- That's about 80 torques less.
- Good.

01:03:19.561 --> 01:03:20.881
- What do you mean, "good"?
- Good.

01:03:20.961 --> 01:03:22.374
Jeremy, you're not really getting

01:03:22.375 --> 01:03:24.001
into the competitive
spirit of this.

01:03:24.081 --> 01:03:27.041
I don't like driving
without friction.

01:03:27.401 --> 01:03:29.561
Open-top rally is going
to be the next big thing.

01:03:29.641 --> 01:03:32.081
Let's go and convert
these into rally cars.

01:03:33.561 --> 01:03:37.081
This meant finding a workshop
and cueing the music.

01:03:42.761 --> 01:03:43.761
Got it.

01:03:48.521 --> 01:03:49.521
Oh, yes.

01:03:49.681 --> 01:03:50.681
God, I'm good.

01:03:53.361 --> 01:03:56.281
That will make up for
the horsepower deficit

01:03:56.361 --> 01:03:57.801
that I have on Richard's car.

01:04:01.121 --> 01:04:02.881
This is August.

01:04:06.641 --> 01:04:08.041
Now Mr April.

01:04:17.041 --> 01:04:19.401
My roll-cage is complete.

01:04:27.441 --> 01:04:30.041
The next day, our cars were ready.

01:04:30.281 --> 01:04:33.481
And so was the sky.

01:04:40.281 --> 01:04:42.201
This is all just fantastic.

01:04:42.281 --> 01:04:44.721
Suddenly, perfect rallying
weather is coming.

01:04:45.161 --> 01:04:47.761
Bit of rain, mud,
mist on the hills,

01:04:47.841 --> 01:04:50.081
and my car is now perfect.

01:04:50.241 --> 01:04:52.241
Haven't gone over the top
with the modifications.

01:04:52.441 --> 01:04:54.641
New wheels, new tyres, roll-cage,

01:04:54.961 --> 01:04:57.001
sponsorship stickers,
can't have real ones,

01:04:57.081 --> 01:04:59.641
BBC objects, but we've made 'em
up to put you in the mood.

01:04:59.841 --> 01:05:03.721
Inside, racing seat, full
harness, that's enough.

01:05:04.121 --> 01:05:05.641
This is going to be amazing.

01:05:08.361 --> 01:05:09.361
I just copied him.

01:05:10.521 --> 01:05:14.161
And now he's going to drive
about in his Datsun in the mud.

01:05:18.081 --> 01:05:20.721
He was right I couldn't wait.

01:05:27.601 --> 01:05:29.081
Oh, yes.

01:05:30.401 --> 01:05:33.201
It's actually raining, I'm
in a rally. This is perfect.

01:05:41.441 --> 01:05:44.241
After all the stupid food
and looking at rocks.

01:05:45.041 --> 01:05:49.201
To come out and do something
genuinely exciting and real and...

01:05:49.881 --> 01:05:51.521
I've come alive.

01:05:53.801 --> 01:05:54.801
Oh, yes.

01:05:57.961 --> 01:06:00.721
Hammond is out now in that.

01:06:04.521 --> 01:06:06.321
The man is insane.

01:06:11.121 --> 01:06:13.841
Bring it on, let's
have more. Come on.

01:06:14.601 --> 01:06:15.601
You call that rain?

01:06:19.921 --> 01:06:21.441
Oh.

01:06:21.521 --> 01:06:24.521
This is my favourite
place in the world now.

01:06:27.641 --> 01:06:28.641
Ah.

01:06:28.721 --> 01:06:30.921
I'm sorry, Hammond, do
try to explain it to me,

01:06:31.001 --> 01:06:33.081
because I'm struggling to get it.

01:06:33.161 --> 01:06:35.801
It's about the most fun I've
had in a very long time.

01:06:35.881 --> 01:06:37.441
I can see why The Stig comes here.

01:06:37.761 --> 01:06:39.401
- You're covered in mud.
- Yeah.

01:06:39.481 --> 01:06:41.265
There's a massive
thunderstorm raging.

01:06:41.266 --> 01:06:42.266
Yeah, I know.

01:06:42.268 --> 01:06:44.068
I know, even the weather's
better here. It's perfect.

01:06:44.081 --> 01:06:45.201
What do you mean, it's better?

01:06:49.481 --> 01:06:51.241
- Hammond, do I have to do this?
- Yep.

01:06:51.361 --> 01:06:54.401
It's my thing today, and
this is what we're doing.

01:06:54.761 --> 01:06:57.521
And so, to show what
a good sport I am,

01:06:57.961 --> 01:06:59.321
I obliged.

01:07:01.761 --> 01:07:03.761
Oh, God's truth.

01:07:07.001 --> 01:07:08.641
Oh. That hurt.

01:07:09.841 --> 01:07:11.001
So, discomfort...

01:07:12.361 --> 01:07:14.801
Oh. That's just horrible.

01:07:16.081 --> 01:07:17.081
Danger.

01:07:17.521 --> 01:07:19.401
Misery, cold.

01:07:22.161 --> 01:07:24.881
Slithering around at
21 miles an hour.

01:07:25.481 --> 01:07:27.241
Oh, no. Bloody...

01:07:28.561 --> 01:07:30.601
I've just had a brown shower.

01:07:31.801 --> 01:07:34.521
That really was the final straw.

01:07:36.081 --> 01:07:38.641
And then it turned out it wasn't.

01:07:39.321 --> 01:07:42.641
So, we got the hang of it, we
now know the course, yeah?

01:07:43.161 --> 01:07:44.921
Time for timed laps.

01:07:45.801 --> 01:07:47.041
- What?
- Well, we do timed laps now,

01:07:47.121 --> 01:07:49.441
that's what we do. I
reckon if we do 10 each

01:07:49.521 --> 01:07:51.641
and then we can just work
out how consistent we are,

01:07:51.721 --> 01:07:54.321
where we can just shave those
extra seconds out, yeah?

01:07:54.721 --> 01:07:56.921
Tomorrow, you are going to eat

01:07:57.001 --> 01:07:59.161
a badger's left teste.

01:08:02.481 --> 01:08:05.841
And so, flying in the
face of common sense,

01:08:07.441 --> 01:08:08.721
we got back out there.

01:08:13.241 --> 01:08:16.281
Timed laps now, so
it's really critical

01:08:16.361 --> 01:08:19.241
to just be brave enough
to keep that power in.

01:08:22.720 --> 01:08:24.961
What's the point of timed laps?

01:08:25.600 --> 01:08:29.041
He's got 80 more horsepower...
Oh... more than I have.

01:08:29.481 --> 01:08:31.361
He's better at it than I am.

01:08:31.481 --> 01:08:34.121
And he's got a
limited-slip differential.

01:08:35.321 --> 01:08:36.520
I haven't got one of those.

01:08:36.600 --> 01:08:40.281
So, when I go round the corner,
one wheel spins and that's It.

01:08:43.281 --> 01:08:46.761
Woo-hoo. God, it feels good
when you get it right.

01:08:49.401 --> 01:08:50.401
Whoa.

01:08:50.921 --> 01:08:52.401
Oh. Oh, my.

01:08:55.161 --> 01:08:56.161
He will have been...

01:08:58.841 --> 01:09:01.361
Oh, here he comes, I can
see his teeth from here.

01:09:03.560 --> 01:09:07.081
Right, overtaking on a rally
stage. This is interesting.

01:09:10.321 --> 01:09:11.321
Oh, he's coming through.

01:09:11.841 --> 01:09:15.121
Oh, no. The hideous little
Brummie has torn past.

01:09:15.401 --> 01:09:17.321
A- ha. Got you.

01:09:18.801 --> 01:09:20.841
Oh, he's done it... Oh,
he's just made everything

01:09:20.921 --> 01:09:23.441
much worse now, I
can't see a thing.

01:09:26.801 --> 01:09:27.801
Muddy goggles.

01:09:33.600 --> 01:09:38.161
Every bone in his crotch, that
is what I'm going to break.

01:09:44.481 --> 01:09:45.481
Oh.

01:09:47.720 --> 01:09:49.520
Soon, the weather got so bad,

01:09:49.600 --> 01:09:52.001
even Hammond couldn't
see where he was going.

01:09:53.520 --> 01:09:56.161
Shit. Shit. Oh.

01:09:57.841 --> 01:10:02.241
So, he suggested we stop for one
of his special rallying lunches.

01:10:03.681 --> 01:10:05.561
Okay, tuck in.

01:10:05.961 --> 01:10:07.841
Really?

01:10:07.921 --> 01:10:11.001
Because this part of France
is famous for its hotdogs.

01:10:11.281 --> 01:10:12.961
It's got French mustard on it.

01:10:13.521 --> 01:10:15.521
- Yeah...
- Wait a minute.

01:10:15.601 --> 01:10:16.601
What?

01:10:16.881 --> 01:10:18.801
You do know what's in
that sausage, don't you?

01:10:19.361 --> 01:10:21.521
- Sausage.
- Pigs' toenails,

01:10:21.601 --> 01:10:22.601
eyelashes...

01:10:24.281 --> 01:10:26.221
Shut up and enjoy it.
And, anyway, while

01:10:26.222 --> 01:10:28.161
you enjoy it, I've got
the timings here.

01:10:28.401 --> 01:10:31.961
I'm around the 1:16,
1:13, that kind of mark.

01:10:32.041 --> 01:10:34.801
You're 1:53, 1:46...

01:10:34.881 --> 01:10:36.681
I've got soil in my ears.

01:10:36.761 --> 01:10:40.921
135, 140... Basically, what this
is showing is that I am clearly

01:10:41.001 --> 01:10:43.001
a lot better at this than you.

01:10:43.081 --> 01:10:44.441
- I'll do you a deal.
- What?

01:10:44.521 --> 01:10:46.361
We will do one more lap.

01:10:46.441 --> 01:10:47.561
Do-or-die lap.

01:10:48.441 --> 01:10:52.121
If I'm faster, we
leave immediately.

01:10:52.201 --> 01:10:53.401
- If you're faster than me?
- Yes.

01:10:53.481 --> 01:10:57.081
All right, well, if I'm faster,
we carry on till dark.

01:10:58.761 --> 01:11:00.241
You'll do that?

01:11:00.321 --> 01:11:01.321
Seriously?

01:11:02.041 --> 01:11:03.041
All right.

01:11:07.641 --> 01:11:09.081
I went first.

01:11:15.241 --> 01:11:16.281
And we're off.

01:11:17.761 --> 01:11:20.681
Right, now, I don't want to just
beat him, I want to humiliate him.

01:11:24.641 --> 01:11:26.761
Oh, yes. That was correct.

01:11:29.241 --> 01:11:30.321
Oh.

01:11:30.481 --> 01:11:33.041
That was a monstrous
dump from below there.

01:11:36.801 --> 01:11:38.921
Nature is joining in with us now.

01:11:40.441 --> 01:11:43.721
Oh, this is just
epically good fun.

01:11:56.561 --> 01:11:59.761
All right, Jeremy, I reckon if
you get within a minute of that,

01:11:59.841 --> 01:12:02.081
I'll be staggered. Not a chance.

01:12:03.561 --> 01:12:05.201
Filled with determination,

01:12:05.281 --> 01:12:08.241
I lined up the BMW
on the start line.

01:12:14.041 --> 01:12:16.361
Right, I am going to win this

01:12:16.441 --> 01:12:18.721
and then we can stop doing it.

01:12:18.801 --> 01:12:20.441
That's... Oh. Hang on a minute.

01:12:22.561 --> 01:12:24.001
Yes.

01:12:24.521 --> 01:12:25.561
What do you think of that?

01:12:27.641 --> 01:12:30.441
Sneaky beaky. Yes.

01:12:34.761 --> 01:12:35.841
Yes.

01:12:39.361 --> 01:12:41.561
The gods are on my side.

01:12:45.481 --> 01:12:48.401
This is going to be
one hell of a Lap.

01:12:56.641 --> 01:12:59.281
We then met up to
see how we'd done.

01:13:00.361 --> 01:13:04.841
Richard Hammond, you did
it in one minute, 17.3.

01:13:04.921 --> 01:13:07.321
- Not my fastest but not bad.
- Well, it was a standing start.

01:13:07.441 --> 01:13:09.321
It was, yes, of course it
was. Yes, go on, them.

01:13:09.681 --> 01:13:11.921
- Me, 28 seconds...
- Yes?

01:13:12.881 --> 01:13:13.961
One minute what?

01:13:14.201 --> 01:13:15.321
28 seconds.

01:13:16.801 --> 01:13:19.321
How did you find a
minute in the...

01:13:20.361 --> 01:13:22.961
- I mean...
- Ultimate driving machine.

01:13:23.401 --> 01:13:25.001
And a BMW Z4.

01:13:25.481 --> 01:13:26.521
Really?

01:13:28.161 --> 01:13:30.641
I left immediately.

01:13:33.721 --> 01:13:37.801
And set off on the
350-mile drive to Pau

01:13:38.841 --> 01:13:42.041
in a V12 Aston Martin.

01:13:47.441 --> 01:13:50.241
Hammond, meanwhile, was
in a Volkswagen Beetle

01:13:50.321 --> 01:13:52.241
and moaning, as usual.

01:13:53.001 --> 01:13:55.081
His cheating is getting
out of control.

01:13:55.161 --> 01:13:58.401
There's no point doing anything if
he's just going to borrow The Stig

01:13:58.481 --> 01:14:00.273
or cut a corner, which
I can only imagine

01:14:00.274 --> 01:14:01.681
is what he did in that instance.

01:14:01.801 --> 01:14:04.481
It must have been one hell of a
corner, he can't even cheat well.

01:14:07.721 --> 01:14:11.481
I admit my shortcut
was a bit short.

01:14:11.561 --> 01:14:15.361
And the time was a bit
implausible. But look,

01:14:15.441 --> 01:14:20.041
the weather is improving and now
I'm in an Aston Martin Vanquish.

01:14:27.881 --> 01:14:31.241
This is a truly magnificent car.

01:14:31.321 --> 01:14:33.801
Best Aston yet by a long way.

01:14:33.881 --> 01:14:37.401
It's a blend of the hardcore DBS

01:14:37.481 --> 01:14:39.641
and the slightly softer Virage.

01:14:42.121 --> 01:14:43.321
It's just tremendous.

01:14:43.961 --> 01:14:46.321
And now I shall hand you
over to Richard Hammond,

01:14:46.401 --> 01:14:49.601
who shall try to explain
why the Porsche 911

01:14:49.681 --> 01:14:52.481
that he's driving is
in some way different

01:14:52.561 --> 01:14:56.241
to all the Porsche 911s
that have gone before.

01:14:57.801 --> 01:15:00.881
How can he go on about
911s all being the same?

01:15:01.121 --> 01:15:04.641
Let me talk you through
the Aston Martin range.

01:15:04.721 --> 01:15:07.561
Vantage V8, V12 Vantage,

01:15:07.641 --> 01:15:11.161
DB9, DBS, Virage, that.

01:15:11.241 --> 01:15:13.081
They're all exactly the same.

01:15:13.161 --> 01:15:15.241
Aston Martin came
up with the design.

01:15:15.321 --> 01:15:16.761
Thought, "Oh, that looks pretty.

01:15:16.841 --> 01:15:18.590
"Let's call it lots
of different things

01:15:18.591 --> 01:15:20.121
and then more people will buy it."

01:15:20.841 --> 01:15:21.961
It's just another one.

01:15:22.281 --> 01:15:25.641
C2, C2S, C4, C4S,

01:15:26.361 --> 01:15:32.721
GT2, GT3, Turbo, 997, 996, 993...

01:15:32.881 --> 01:15:35.121
The new 911 is called the 991,

01:15:35.201 --> 01:15:38.161
it's longer and wider
than the previous 911.

01:15:38.241 --> 01:15:40.338
It's got a new engine, new gear

01:15:40.339 --> 01:15:42.841
box, new interior
and new steering.

01:15:42.921 --> 01:15:45.321
This is the critical
point, for the first time,

01:15:45.401 --> 01:15:48.761
the steering is electric
rather than purely hydraulic.

01:15:49.441 --> 01:15:51.681
Just as I was getting
into the groove,

01:15:51.961 --> 01:15:54.201
Jeremy pulled off again.

01:16:00.161 --> 01:16:01.281
What now?

01:16:01.841 --> 01:16:05.281
Well, I thought it would be a good
idea, since we're at Pau tomorrow,

01:16:05.921 --> 01:16:08.641
to reacquaint ourselves
with the concept

01:16:08.721 --> 01:16:10.521
of driving while under the
influence of friction.

01:16:10.761 --> 01:16:11.841
I don't like friction.

01:16:12.921 --> 01:16:15.041
Pau, mate. It's Pau.

01:16:15.241 --> 01:16:17.801
They've been racing
there since 1901.

01:16:18.241 --> 01:16:19.801
Fangio has raced there,

01:16:19.881 --> 01:16:23.161
Jim Clark, Jackie Stewart.
This is a big deal.

01:16:23.521 --> 01:16:28.361
This is... It's Bethlehem for
any motoring enthusiast.

01:16:29.521 --> 01:16:30.961
So, what's it got to do with that?

01:16:31.241 --> 01:16:32.681
We've got to get match fit.

01:16:33.081 --> 01:16:35.761
And then when we get
to Pau tomorrow...

01:16:36.681 --> 01:16:38.841
We'll be worthy of it.

01:16:50.121 --> 01:16:52.601
Straightaway, I was very happy.

01:16:53.321 --> 01:16:56.121
No wet track, no mud,

01:16:56.201 --> 01:16:58.481
no rain, no diphtheria.

01:17:04.521 --> 01:17:07.801
This is one tight and
twisty little track.

01:17:12.801 --> 01:17:15.401
Right, now, let's turn the Aston

01:17:15.481 --> 01:17:20.521
from a road car into
something more track-based.

01:17:20.601 --> 01:17:23.521
We'll push this button here,
that firms up the suspension.

01:17:23.601 --> 01:17:26.721
And then push this one, S, I
think it stands for "silly".

01:17:27.321 --> 01:17:28.455
Because when you push it... Ready?

01:17:28.841 --> 01:17:31.761
The whole car goes, "What?" It's
like saying "walkies" to a dog.

01:17:31.841 --> 01:17:32.921
"Oh, really? Walkies?"

01:17:39.801 --> 01:17:41.971
This has the same
basic engine that

01:17:41.972 --> 01:17:44.201
was fitted to the
original Vanquish.

01:17:44.921 --> 01:17:47.441
And that was comparable at
the time to the Ferrari 550

01:17:47.521 --> 01:17:49.041
or 575.

01:17:50.281 --> 01:17:53.641
Since then, Ferrari have moved
on, they're at the F12 now.

01:17:56.321 --> 01:17:59.121
This doesn't even have a
double-clutch gearbox.

01:17:59.881 --> 01:18:03.001
It's an old 7-speed slushmatic.

01:18:05.121 --> 01:18:07.921
Each gear is delivered
by an elderly butler.

01:18:08.361 --> 01:18:10.961
"I'd like third now, Jeeves."
"Certainly, sir, I'll just

01:18:11.481 --> 01:18:13.761
"pop off and get it. I
think it's in my pantry.

01:18:14.761 --> 01:18:16.201
"There you are, sir."

01:18:17.601 --> 01:18:21.161
Very smooth, lovely on the
road, not brilliant here.

01:18:25.361 --> 01:18:26.841
It's a bit of an ark, this.

01:18:26.921 --> 01:18:28.561
It's a very pretty ark.

01:18:28.961 --> 01:18:32.921
But when you stick it into
a corner on a track...

01:18:38.001 --> 01:18:41.801
you know that beneath
the carbon fibre body,

01:18:42.761 --> 01:18:44.441
everything's a bit old.

01:18:50.921 --> 01:18:54.281
Not that there's much wrong
with old, as you can see.

01:18:57.681 --> 01:18:59.601
Mean while, far behind...

01:19:05.801 --> 01:19:09.281
Hammond was revelling
in the new 917's grip.

01:19:11.521 --> 01:19:14.241
God, this thing is planted.

01:19:20.121 --> 01:19:22.041
Still a 3.8-litre flat six,

01:19:22.121 --> 01:19:24.961
it's still mounted at the back
of the car, it's still compact.

01:19:26.801 --> 01:19:30.121
The big issue, though, is
that electric steering.

01:19:34.241 --> 01:19:36.492
It's not talking
to me. It's not...

01:19:36.493 --> 01:19:38.681
It should be telling me everything

01:19:38.761 --> 01:19:41.521
by going slightly light
at the front under power.

01:19:41.601 --> 01:19:44.721
It means the front wheels can
move around a little bit more

01:19:44.801 --> 01:19:46.521
than they would in
an ordinary car.

01:19:49.281 --> 01:19:51.601
And the steering wheel should
be telling me about that,

01:19:51.681 --> 01:19:55.041
that's what lets me
know it is a 911

01:19:55.161 --> 01:19:57.361
and not an R8 or a Jaguar.

01:20:05.361 --> 01:20:07.521
Does it feel like a 911?

01:20:09.801 --> 01:20:11.921
I don't think it does.

01:20:13.521 --> 01:20:16.801
And for Pau, I want something
that's more of a 911.

01:20:18.641 --> 01:20:20.241
And I've had a very
good idea for that.

01:20:25.161 --> 01:20:27.401
I shall be using this,

01:20:27.601 --> 01:20:31.081
the brand-new Porsche 991 GT3.

01:20:34.001 --> 01:20:35.801
I am desperate to drive it.

01:20:36.081 --> 01:20:38.161
It's lighter, lower, faster.

01:20:38.241 --> 01:20:40.841
This is my unicorn,

01:20:41.081 --> 01:20:42.961
my Helena.

01:20:43.161 --> 01:20:45.481
Track-focused the GT3 may be,

01:20:47.121 --> 01:20:50.921
but at Pau, it would be
no match for my choice.

01:20:54.201 --> 01:20:56.521
The single-seater BACMono.

01:20:56.961 --> 01:21:00.881
One of the fastest cars ever to
take on the Top Gear test track.

01:21:02.361 --> 01:21:06.721
Purity simplified,
light, agile, balanced.

01:21:08.001 --> 01:21:09.441
Perfect.

01:21:11.881 --> 01:21:15.281
As men set about fettling
our cars for the big day...

01:21:21.481 --> 01:21:25.001
we ruminated on all the
boats and bikes and cars

01:21:25.281 --> 01:21:27.521
that we'd used on our journey.

01:21:30.321 --> 01:21:32.201
Hammond.

01:21:33.041 --> 01:21:37.361
And we tried to work out which
one we'd liked the best.

01:21:43.961 --> 01:21:47.081
I loved that little
Fiesta ST, I really did.

01:21:47.441 --> 01:21:50.521
I actually loved driving the
Model-T, crazy though that is.

01:21:50.921 --> 01:21:52.761
I enjoyed the Ducati.

01:21:52.921 --> 01:21:57.121
But for some reason, the Ferrari
F12 has really stayed with me.

01:21:57.201 --> 01:22:00.641
I thought it had presence
and drama and it's fast.

01:22:00.801 --> 01:22:05.481
I wouldn't have the SLS because
that's too much to use every day.

01:22:06.961 --> 01:22:09.361
Golf GTI isn't quite enough.

01:22:10.441 --> 01:22:13.081
Bugatti Veyron, I mean it's the
other end of the scale, then.

01:22:14.001 --> 01:22:15.881
Too much. Bentley...

01:22:16.761 --> 01:22:20.161
Oh, it's a great car but...
I've worked out what I'd have.

01:22:22.201 --> 01:22:24.681
The Riva Aquarama.

01:22:25.001 --> 01:22:26.281
- That's your favourite car?
- Yes.

01:22:26.361 --> 01:22:29.281
That's what I'd use every
day. I'd have to move house.

01:22:32.081 --> 01:22:35.161
With that decided, we climbed
back into our road cars

01:22:35.241 --> 01:22:37.481
for the final push to Pau.

01:22:40.521 --> 01:22:43.081
We were very excited
by what lay ahead,

01:22:43.161 --> 01:22:46.641
so excited that we left the
camera crew far behind.

01:22:47.361 --> 01:22:49.237
And when they finally
caught up with

01:22:49.238 --> 01:22:50.961
us, there was a bit of a problem.

01:22:56.641 --> 01:22:57.801
You mean, passports?

01:22:58.161 --> 01:23:00.761
Oh, right

01:23:01.881 --> 01:23:04.281
The French policemen
and lady policemen

01:23:04.481 --> 01:23:07.441
insisted that we should
give them all our money.

01:23:07.841 --> 01:23:09.921
And then after quite a long chat,

01:23:10.081 --> 01:23:12.251
they decided it
would be best if we

01:23:12.252 --> 01:23:14.241
didn't drive in France any more.

01:23:14.561 --> 01:23:15.801
Yeah, okay.

01:23:25.721 --> 01:23:28.201
And on that bombshell,
it is time to end.

01:23:28.281 --> 01:23:30.481
Thank you very much for
watching, goodbye.

01:23:31.121 --> 01:23:33.121
You total plonker.

01:23:42.121 --> 01:23:45.721
I don't want to go in a Peugeot

01:23:53.761 --> 01:23:56.001
Or this Vauxhall Zafira.

01:23:56.081 --> 01:23:58.001
Can you be picky when
you're a hitch-hiker?

01:23:58.081 --> 01:23:59.681
I should think so. There's
plenty of choice.

01:24:11.401 --> 01:24:13.041
Don't want to go in that Citroen.
