00:16.349 --> 00:18.101
[Bubbles] Finally, one of those.

00:18.518 --> 00:20.311
Box number 2, boys.

00:21.938 --> 00:23.231
Ah, yes!

00:23.440 --> 00:25.150
Decent!

00:25.400 --> 00:28.028
That's even nicer than
I thought it would be.

00:28.737 --> 00:31.614
There's nothing better
than unboxing brand-new shit.

00:31.698 --> 00:34.034
You know it's gonna make you
a lot more money.

00:34.451 --> 00:36.161
[Ricky] You're fucking starting
to sound like Julian.

00:36.244 --> 00:38.913
Eat my ass, Ricky. Making money
is what business is all about.

00:38.997 --> 00:40.915
I'm not just doing this
for the fun of it.

00:41.583 --> 00:43.710
Well, we're doing it
for the fun of it too, Julian.

00:43.793 --> 00:44.753
Think about it.

00:44.836 --> 00:46.796
Working with my two best buddies,

00:46.880 --> 00:48.923
everything legit,
on the up-and-up,

00:49.007 --> 00:50.216
beer's amazing.

00:50.508 --> 00:51.551
[giggle]
I'm telling you, boys,

00:51.634 --> 00:53.970
if we can just keep doing this
the way we're doing it,

00:54.387 --> 00:56.347
we're gonna be
fucking unstoppable!

00:56.431 --> 00:58.141
-Yeah!
-Unstop... Ricky!

00:58.224 --> 01:00.810
All right. You okay to hold down the fort
while we get supplies?

01:00.977 --> 01:03.396
-Yeah, of course, I am.
-Where's the list then, bud?

01:03.480 --> 01:05.815
Uh... just wait.
Where is the fucking list?

01:06.066 --> 01:09.319
Right there. Get exactly
the things I want. Don't...

01:09.694 --> 01:11.613
try to get, you know,
fancy with it.

01:11.696 --> 01:12.864
All right. No problem.

01:12.947 --> 01:15.617
Guys, I want to tell you
how proud I am of you two.

01:15.992 --> 01:18.661
I just wish we had've gotten
our shit together, like, 20 years ago.

01:18.745 --> 01:20.413
-Mmm.
-Yeah. This is cool.

01:20.497 --> 01:21.581
-Yeah, me too.
-No shit.

01:21.664 --> 01:22.832
Who's the one that's been saying,

01:22.916 --> 01:24.542
-"Get your shit together"?
-[coughing]

01:24.626 --> 01:25.543
Ricky...

01:25.752 --> 01:26.753
-Rick...
-[spitting]

01:26.836 --> 01:29.339
-Rick, just...
-Don't be spitting on my fucking floor!

01:29.422 --> 01:30.757
-Sorry, man.
-Clean that up.

01:30.840 --> 01:32.717
Forgot we were fucking inside.
Your place looks fucked.

01:33.426 --> 01:34.719
[Bubbles] Ricky, you know...

01:34.803 --> 01:36.679
big fucking loogs like that,

01:36.763 --> 01:39.307
your body's trying to tell you
to chill out. You know that, right?

01:39.390 --> 01:41.559
I know, but my brains are
telling me to smoke more,

01:41.643 --> 01:43.394
-They're the ones that make the talk.
-[horn honking]

01:43.478 --> 01:44.813
Oh, let's go. Come on.

01:44.896 --> 01:46.189
What the fuck is going on here?

01:46.564 --> 01:49.317
Candy took the day off work,
she's gonna come get supplies with us,

01:49.400 --> 01:52.112
then, she's fucking taking me out
for lunch to talk to me about something.

01:52.195 --> 01:55.365
[Ricky] Oh, fuck. Sorry, man.
She's fucking breaking up with you.

01:55.657 --> 01:57.492
-What do you mean?
-Think about it.

01:57.575 --> 01:59.911
She needs to talk to you, lunch,
that's break-up shit.

01:59.994 --> 02:01.704
Was just a matter of time anyway,
I guess.

02:01.913 --> 02:03.039
You think so?

02:03.414 --> 02:04.290
Well, look at her.

02:04.374 --> 02:06.292
She's a good-looking chick,
rich and smart.

02:06.376 --> 02:08.294
Look at you. You're fucked-looking,
just a muscle dummy.

02:08.377 --> 02:10.213
And you're dumb, broke,
and you're a criminal.

02:10.295 --> 02:12.549
Not anymore, man,
I'm getting my shit together. Come on.

02:12.632 --> 02:15.176
Oh, great. We'll see.
This is gonna be a real good time.

02:15.260 --> 02:17.011
Can't fucking smoke dope
in the car now, Julian.

02:17.095 --> 02:18.972
Just get in the fucking car.
Fuck's sake.

02:19.055 --> 02:20.265
-Hey, baby.
-[sweetly] Hi!

02:20.348 --> 02:22.058
-How you doing?
-Nice shirt. Good.

02:22.767 --> 02:24.853
-Right on.
-Handsome.

02:25.186 --> 02:27.147
-[vehicle approaching]
-[Ricky] What the fuck does she want?

02:27.897 --> 02:29.983
-[tires grinding on gravel]
-[Ricky] Jesus Christ!

02:30.066 --> 02:32.026
[Julian] Ricky, ignore her.
Don't even fucking talk to her.

02:32.110 --> 02:33.945
I should at least see
what she fucking wants.

02:34.028 --> 02:36.489
-Get in the fucking car.
-[car door opening, closing]

02:36.573 --> 02:38.867
That's a little fucking close.
What the fuck are you doing here?

02:39.909 --> 02:43.872
Well, to be honest, Ricky,
I can't stop fucking thinking about you.

02:43.955 --> 02:45.498
And I'm not happy about it.

02:45.582 --> 02:47.083
Oh, really? Well, if we're being honest,

02:47.167 --> 02:48.668
I can't stop fucking
thinking about you either.

02:48.751 --> 02:51.504
It is driving me fucking nuts!
It's making me insane!

02:51.588 --> 02:55.300
Oh-h-h-h-h-h! Poor baby!
How do you think I feel?

02:55.383 --> 02:58.177
You think I like not being able to
stop thinking about a fucking loser?

02:58.428 --> 03:01.264
Think I like not being able to stop
thinking about a fucking bitchy asshole

03:01.347 --> 03:04.058
who keeps yelling at me, treats me like
fucking shit? That's awesome!

03:04.142 --> 03:06.477
-[Susan] What are we gonna do about it?
-I don't know.

03:06.561 --> 03:07.937
We're not getting back together.
Are we?

03:08.021 --> 03:09.188
I don't know, maybe we are.

03:09.272 --> 03:10.648
Oh, you want to get back together?

03:10.732 --> 03:12.901
-Yeah, maybe I fucking do!
- Well, let's fucking do it then...

03:12.984 --> 03:13.943
Oh, ho, ho! Great news!

03:14.027 --> 03:15.945
-That'll be a great fucking time!
-Great fucking news, Rick!

03:16.029 --> 03:18.406
Once again, Susan gets her way
and we get back together, right?

03:18.489 --> 03:20.033
-Goddamn fucking right I do.
-All right. Perfect.

03:20.116 --> 03:21.117
We're fucking back together then.

03:21.200 --> 03:22.285
[Candy chuckling]

03:24.370 --> 03:25.455
[Candy laughing]

03:25.538 --> 03:27.624
-[Julian] They're so fucked.
-[laughing]

03:27.707 --> 03:30.543
[theme music]

04:09.916 --> 04:12.001
-[Mr. Lahey] For fuck's sakes!
-[clattering]

04:12.085 --> 04:13.836
[muttering]
...fuck...

04:17.423 --> 04:18.757
Fuck...

04:21.678 --> 04:23.554
-[Mr. Lahey] How you doing?
-[man] Uh, good?

04:23.638 --> 04:25.348
Jim Lahey, supervisor.

04:25.431 --> 04:27.642
I just noticed you driving around here
three or four times.

04:27.725 --> 04:29.310
Anything I can do to help you?

04:29.394 --> 04:31.229
Yeah, I'm looking for Julian.

04:32.021 --> 04:33.231
-Julian?
-Mm.

04:33.564 --> 04:35.358
Oh, you just missed him.

04:35.441 --> 04:37.277
-Oh...
-Yeah, he just left.

04:37.360 --> 04:39.237
Uh, don't know when he'll be back.

04:39.737 --> 04:42.240
Sometimes he's gone
for three or four days.

04:42.323 --> 04:45.910
-Oh... well, that sucks shit.
-Yeah.

04:47.161 --> 04:48.830
-Days, huh?
-Yeah.

04:48.997 --> 04:49.872
Listen uh...

04:50.581 --> 04:53.751
I'm a good friend of his.
Uh, anything I can do to help you?

04:53.835 --> 04:57.088
Well, I bought a bunch of beer from him
and it sold out real quick.

04:57.171 --> 05:01.175
Now I've got a big event coming up
and I want 200 cases of the stuff.

05:01.259 --> 05:02.719
200 cases?

05:02.802 --> 05:04.137
-Yeah.
-Oh, geez!

05:04.387 --> 05:06.306
Well, I'll be sure
to let him know then.

05:06.389 --> 05:07.974
Oh, well, groovy.

05:08.391 --> 05:10.435
Just tell him to call Big Hawk.

05:12.937 --> 05:15.023
Yeah well, I'll have to take...

05:15.106 --> 05:17.233
take your word for it...
[chuckling]

05:17.317 --> 05:18.860
Mr. Big Cock.

05:25.700 --> 05:27.910
[Julian] We should get supplies
all the time, you know?

05:27.994 --> 05:28.828
All right.

05:28.911 --> 05:30.872
This wine stinks, though.
How do people drink wine?

05:30.955 --> 05:32.290
It doesn't stink. It's good.

05:32.373 --> 05:35.335
-Is it?
-Yes. Makes you do crazy shit.

05:35.668 --> 05:37.378
I'm gonna have to
try some wine then.

05:38.046 --> 05:40.173
What the fuck is she doing,
stringing him along?

05:40.548 --> 05:43.676
-Ridiculous.
-Baby, you're so suspicious.

05:43.885 --> 05:44.969
[sighing]
Sorry, babe.

05:45.887 --> 05:47.472
All right, one of these right here.

05:48.306 --> 05:50.099
Why don't you use the organic kind?

05:50.183 --> 05:53.227
Well, this is the one on the list and, uh,
that's almost twice the money.

05:53.311 --> 05:55.354
-So we'll get this one, I guess.
-Yeah, but...

05:55.438 --> 05:58.733
the organic kind is grown without GMOs
and disgusting spider DNA.

05:58.816 --> 06:00.526
-Well...
-You can sell the beer for more.

06:00.610 --> 06:02.904
I get it, but I don't know anything
about spiders and shit,

06:02.987 --> 06:04.280
and Bubbles said to get this one,

06:04.363 --> 06:06.074
and Bubbles is the beer
expert, right? Not you.

06:06.157 --> 06:07.408
So we'll get this one.

06:07.700 --> 06:09.702
I never said I was a fucking beer expert.

06:10.036 --> 06:12.538
And God forbid you
use your fucking brain for once.

06:12.622 --> 06:14.999
I don't need to use my brain,
because we have a list.

06:15.083 --> 06:17.752
So why would I use my fucking brain
if I don't have to?

06:18.127 --> 06:20.088
That might be the dumbest thing
anybody has ever said

06:20.171 --> 06:22.173
-in the history of the world, Ricky.
-Actually, it's not.

06:22.256 --> 06:25.009
It's not even the fucking dumbest thing
I've said today. So wrong again, Susan!

06:25.093 --> 06:27.804
Jesus fucking Christ,
here we fucking go again, aren't we?

06:27.887 --> 06:29.430
-Yep. Yep.
-Okay, great. You know what?

06:29.514 --> 06:32.683
You take this fucking bag of fucking hops.
I'll get the rest of this shit.

06:32.767 --> 06:35.478
Just stay the fuck away from me till
we leave! Fuck!

06:35.686 --> 06:37.355
You carry your own oats!

06:38.356 --> 06:39.190
Soulmates.

06:39.273 --> 06:40.733
-Wow.
-[Julian chuckles]

06:41.818 --> 06:43.778
[Mr. Lahey] Where'd George put
the drone thing, Randy?

06:43.861 --> 06:45.655
[Randy] You don't need
the drone, Mr. Lahey.

06:45.738 --> 06:47.782
I still can't believe
you let him move in here.

06:47.865 --> 06:50.785
Well, George is right, Randy.
The boys are up to something.

06:50.868 --> 06:52.453
You've got to stop this, Mr. Lahey.

06:52.537 --> 06:54.914
You're gonna get pulled right back
into the shit abyss.

06:54.997 --> 06:58.042
I'm not gonna get sucked back
into the shit abyss, Randy!

06:58.126 --> 07:00.878
Look, there's something going on,
and that's re...

07:01.170 --> 07:02.004
Guess what?

07:02.088 --> 07:03.714
Today, there was a shady-looking guy

07:03.798 --> 07:06.175
driving around the park
looking for Julian,

07:06.259 --> 07:07.969
wanting to buy some fucking beer, Randy.

07:08.052 --> 07:10.430
Is that not shit abyss-y
enough for you?

07:10.680 --> 07:13.683
Geez, Mr. Lahey, maybe
he was just trying to buy some more beer.

07:13.766 --> 07:16.310
-Did you ever think of that?
-[mocking laughter]

07:16.394 --> 07:18.604
George is getting you all worked up.

07:18.688 --> 07:21.190
Those boys have been keeping
their noses clean.

07:21.274 --> 07:23.860
Th... Those boys have
had shit-encrusted noses

07:23.943 --> 07:26.946
ever since they were this high to
a shit-erpillar, Randy.

07:27.321 --> 07:30.241
And what about the fucking gunfight?
What about that, huh?

07:30.324 --> 07:32.618
-They were protecting themselves.
-Randy,

07:33.161 --> 07:34.954
what are you trying to tell me?

07:35.538 --> 07:37.582
I think we should bury
the hatchet, Mr. Lahey.

07:37.665 --> 07:40.209
-What?
-And maybe try to work with those guys.

07:40.543 --> 07:42.879
Work with them?
Are you nuts?

07:42.962 --> 07:45.590
Well, being part of a beer company
might be fun.

07:46.090 --> 07:49.469
And plus, it's better for Sunnyvale
if everyone just gets along.

07:49.552 --> 07:51.262
Randy, I don't know.

07:52.054 --> 07:52.930
Mr. Lahey, please,

07:53.014 --> 07:55.933
just come and talk to Bubbles with me
and see what he's got to say.

07:56.267 --> 07:58.102
I don't like seeing you like this.

07:58.186 --> 08:01.481
What the fuck?
Get out of here, shit bag!

08:01.564 --> 08:03.941
I've got a few of
my new parts installed

08:04.025 --> 08:06.235
and now this baby's going
to the next fucking level.

08:06.319 --> 08:09.864
I mean, the cold filtering process
is just gonna be unbelievable.

08:10.072 --> 08:12.825
At this point, I mean,
if I was lighting off a Saturn 5 rocket,

08:12.909 --> 08:14.869
I'd be on the horn with
Mission Control right now:

08:14.952 --> 08:17.538
"She's good to go, baby!
Light the fucking fuse."

08:17.622 --> 08:18.623
[giggling]

08:18.998 --> 08:19.874
[Randy] Hey, Bubbles.

08:20.958 --> 08:22.335
Hey, Randy.

08:22.668 --> 08:24.670
Mr. Lahey.
What do you guys want?

08:24.962 --> 08:25.963
Got a question for you.

08:26.047 --> 08:28.883
I'm gonna get straight to the point,
no beating around the bush.

08:29.467 --> 08:31.385
Okay. Well,
by saying that, Randy,

08:31.469 --> 08:32.970
you're actually
beating around the bush.

08:33.054 --> 08:34.347
[chuckle]

08:34.889 --> 08:36.140
Okay, here it goes.

08:37.183 --> 08:38.768
Is this beer business
that you've got going

08:38.851 --> 08:40.727
with Julian and Ricky legit?

08:41.854 --> 08:43.188
Is it legit?

08:43.981 --> 08:46.817
Okay, Randy, you tell me.
Here, look.

08:48.027 --> 08:49.195
-You tell me...
-[bottle hissing]

08:49.278 --> 08:51.489
if I'd be put my heart
and soul into that

08:51.572 --> 08:53.074
if it wasn't fucking legit.

08:53.741 --> 08:55.159
Drive that into your guts.

08:58.162 --> 09:00.623
Yeah, there you go.
Crank that into your shit tank.

09:00.706 --> 09:02.250
-Tell me it's not legit.
-[loud burp]

09:02.833 --> 09:04.669
Holy frig, that's amazing!

09:04.752 --> 09:06.003
Try it, Mr. Lahey.

09:06.295 --> 09:08.798
That's fucking 100% my recipe

09:09.340 --> 09:10.216
with the boys,

09:10.299 --> 09:11.717
and that is heart and soul, Randy.

09:11.801 --> 09:13.219
It's good, isn't it, Mr. Lahey?

09:13.302 --> 09:14.887
Peasantly supplising.
That's an...

09:15.429 --> 09:17.098
extremely good beer, Bubbles.

09:17.306 --> 09:18.266
Oh, I know it is.

09:18.349 --> 09:20.268
Can we buy a couple cases off you?

09:20.726 --> 09:21.852
Well, if you got money, Randy,

09:21.936 --> 09:24.021
I'll take your fucking
money all day, baby.

09:24.188 --> 09:25.356
I've got no change, though.

09:25.439 --> 09:27.400
Two cases right there,
just bottled.

09:27.483 --> 09:29.360
-[Randy] Awesome.
-So is that all you wanted?

09:29.443 --> 09:31.988
Come down here and snoop around,
see if I'm breaking the law?

09:32.405 --> 09:34.031
No. We wanted to come down here

09:34.115 --> 09:35.700
and bury the hatchet
once and for all

09:35.783 --> 09:38.160
-and have a fresh start with you guys.
-[Lahey] Right.

09:38.536 --> 09:40.580
Well, that would be, actually,
really cool, Randy,

09:40.663 --> 09:42.540
if I believed you,
but I don't.

09:42.748 --> 09:44.458
We want everyone working together

09:44.542 --> 09:46.961
for the betterment of
Sunnyvale, as a team.

09:47.962 --> 09:49.130
Well, I've always been for

09:49.213 --> 09:51.549
the fucking betterment of Sunnyvale,
Randy, you know that.

09:51.632 --> 09:52.508
[Mr. Lahey] That's true.

09:52.883 --> 09:55.761
Okay well, if you're gonna do this
big beer deal with Big Hawk,

09:55.845 --> 09:57.430
I was thinking that
you're probably gonna need...

09:57.513 --> 09:59.640
-Whoa, whoa, whoa, R...
-No, let me finish, Mr. Lahey.

09:59.724 --> 10:01.601
-Big Hawk?
-You're gonna need more space,

10:01.684 --> 10:04.604
and that's something that Mr. Lahey and I
could easily arrange through Barb.

10:04.687 --> 10:06.522
Just wait, just pump the fucking
brakes there, Randy.

10:06.606 --> 10:08.441
What are you talking about,
deal with Big Hawk?

10:08.524 --> 10:09.984
Bubbles didn't know anything about it.

10:10.067 --> 10:12.361
-I was just about to tell you, Bubs.
-Tell me what?

10:12.445 --> 10:14.488
Well, I, I bumped into
Big Cock this morning

10:14.572 --> 10:16.115
and he wanted me to tell you guys

10:16.198 --> 10:19.827
that he would like to
order 200 cases of beer.

10:20.369 --> 10:21.454
-What?
-[Mr. Lahey] Yeah!

10:21.537 --> 10:22.455
200 cases?!

10:22.538 --> 10:23.456
Yeah, yeah...

10:23.539 --> 10:25.166
-Holy fuck!
-This might be the perfect time

10:25.249 --> 10:28.628
for us partner up with some good,
honest help, Bubbles.

10:28.711 --> 10:30.504
-Partner up? Who partner up?
-Put 'er up there.

10:30.588 --> 10:32.256
Look, I got a contract here, too, Bubs,

10:32.340 --> 10:34.550
-if you're interested.
-A contr... For who? What?

10:34.925 --> 10:37.094
-This is...
-No, just... Shields up! Shields up!

10:37.178 --> 10:38.679
Something's not fucking right here!

10:38.763 --> 10:40.806
-What's wrong?
-What do you mean, what's wrong?

10:40.890 --> 10:42.975
You're down here talking about
the betterment of Sunnyvale

10:43.059 --> 10:45.561
and there's a secret deal
with Big Hawk going on...

10:45.645 --> 10:46.812
I don't fucking think so.

10:46.896 --> 10:48.689
Shields up!
Off my property!

10:48.773 --> 10:50.650
Fucking beat it right now,
both of yous.

10:51.067 --> 10:52.735
-Come on, Randy, get going.
-[smack]

10:53.486 --> 10:54.654
Randy, get the beer!

10:55.279 --> 10:56.113
[frustrated sigh]

10:56.197 --> 10:57.490
[Bubbles] I don't trust you, Lahey.

10:57.907 --> 10:59.700
You're up to something,
and I fucking know it.

11:00.076 --> 11:01.702
Yeah, that's it, skittle away.

11:02.119 --> 11:03.454
Skittle away, bud.

11:04.497 --> 11:05.706
[exhaling]

11:06.540 --> 11:08.626
Now, what I was saying before

11:08.709 --> 11:10.086
about the cold filtering...

11:10.544 --> 11:12.797
process... No, you know what?
I can't do this right now,

11:12.880 --> 11:13.964
I'm too ranged up.

11:14.215 --> 11:16.008
I'll tell you guys about it later.

11:16.675 --> 11:19.095
-I just need to take a fucking minute.
-[clattering]

11:20.513 --> 11:22.473
See? Look,
crashing into things,

11:22.556 --> 11:24.058
which I normally wouldn't do

11:24.558 --> 11:26.394
if I wasn't all jinkity-janked!

11:27.228 --> 11:30.189
I don't know how Big Hawk
and Lahey got together

11:30.272 --> 11:32.733
to flush this one out,
but this is fucking huge.

11:33.025 --> 11:34.610
-This is huge.
-[phone ringing]

11:34.693 --> 11:36.237
All right, fine,
I'll fucking listen!

11:36.320 --> 11:37.655
Okay, good!
Can you stop talking?

11:37.738 --> 11:40.533
'Cause you can't listen and talk
at the same time unless you're a wizard!

11:40.616 --> 11:41.826
[Julian] Surprise, surprise.
Look at them,

11:41.909 --> 11:43.494
still fighting in the parking lot.

11:44.245 --> 11:45.830
[cellphone buzzing]

11:46.330 --> 11:48.749
-What's up, Bubs?
-Hey, Julian, big fucking news.

11:48.833 --> 11:50.918
[Julian] Just a sec,
I've got to put you on speakerphone.

11:51.001 --> 11:53.045
- What's up, man?
-Uh, we might have a deal

11:53.129 --> 11:55.714
for 200 fucking cases,
that's what's up.

11:55.798 --> 11:57.883
No fucking way!
Are you kidding me?

11:58.134 --> 12:00.010
[Bubbles] Yes, sir. You've got to
get back here right away.

12:00.094 --> 12:01.220
We've got to deal with this.

12:01.303 --> 12:03.264
[Julian] Okay. We're gonna
grab a quick bite.

12:03.347 --> 12:05.266
- We'll be back in a bit.
-Not a bit.

12:05.349 --> 12:07.935
You've got to come now.
I've got to know if this is real!

12:08.519 --> 12:10.479
Bubs, calm down.
Just give Big Hawk a call,

12:10.563 --> 12:12.231
fucking ask him
if the deal's for real, man.

12:12.314 --> 12:14.817
[heavy sigh]
Well, what if he starts questioning me,

12:14.900 --> 12:17.736
asking me about numbers and stuff?
I don't want to look stupid.

12:17.820 --> 12:20.072
Tell him I'll call later and
work out the details, okay?

12:20.156 --> 12:22.241
I've got to go, all right?
See you, man. Bye-bye.

12:22.408 --> 12:23.284
Sweet!

12:23.367 --> 12:24.493
-Holy fuck!
-Shit!

12:24.577 --> 12:25.744
You're like my good luck charm.

12:26.078 --> 12:27.204
-Thanks, baby.
-All right, let's go.

12:27.288 --> 12:28.372
-Okay.
-Thank you.

12:28.456 --> 12:30.040
-Thanks.
-Fucking awesome!

12:31.000 --> 12:33.502
[giggling softly]
This could be big, fellas.

12:33.794 --> 12:35.296
-Cross your paws.
-[kitten mewing]

12:35.379 --> 12:36.505
[nervous giggle]

12:42.261 --> 12:43.345
[Candy] Oh, here they come.

12:43.429 --> 12:44.597
-Hey.
-[Susan] Hey.

12:44.680 --> 12:45.556
Is everything okay?

12:45.639 --> 12:46.891
-Yeah. Everything's great.
-Yeah!

12:47.057 --> 12:47.892
So good.

12:47.975 --> 12:49.685
Hey, would you mind, uh,
getting your own table,

12:49.768 --> 12:51.854
'cause I have something
I want to talk to Julian about

12:51.937 --> 12:53.689
and it's kind of important?

12:53.772 --> 12:55.399
Yeah, well, that's not gonna happen.

12:55.483 --> 12:56.692
-[Susan mouthing silently]
-Pardon?

12:56.817 --> 12:58.486
I know what you're going to
talk about, no way

12:58.569 --> 12:59.695
I'm leaving my best friend alone.

12:59.778 --> 13:02.072
Just do it in front of me.
I don't give a fuck.

13:02.239 --> 13:03.657
-Thank you.
-What are you talking...

13:03.741 --> 13:05.075
What the hell is he talking about?

13:05.159 --> 13:06.035
I...

13:07.495 --> 13:09.830
Thanks. What the fuck is...
Can I get a couple draft,

13:09.914 --> 13:11.290
and a vodka cran?

13:11.373 --> 13:13.209
-A vodka cran for her.
-Rum and coke, please.

13:13.542 --> 13:14.710
[Candy] Water's fine.

13:15.294 --> 13:16.212
Thanks.

13:16.545 --> 13:19.340
Oh, look at us.
We're so fucking happy.

13:19.632 --> 13:21.217
Don't be so jealous.

13:21.300 --> 13:22.426
I think it's sweet.

13:22.843 --> 13:25.221
How do you guys
get along so well with each other?

13:25.304 --> 13:28.057
Um, I think it's open communication

13:28.140 --> 13:30.893
and being 100% honest
with each other.

13:30.976 --> 13:33.103
[giggling]
That's weird, 'cause...

13:33.312 --> 13:35.064
me and Ricky are totally honest
with each other,

13:35.147 --> 13:37.066
yet we fight constantly.
Right, baby?

13:37.149 --> 13:38.943
[awkward laugh]
Y... Yeah.

13:41.070 --> 13:42.154
Why are you being so spazzy?

13:42.238 --> 13:44.740
-I just don't know what... to order.
-What's wrong with your fucking eyes?

13:44.823 --> 13:46.325
I'm just...
There's so much stuff on here.

13:46.408 --> 13:48.118
You've never lied to me, have you?

13:48.869 --> 13:51.914
Well, is not telling you something
the same as lying? It's not, right?

13:52.748 --> 13:54.333
Are there things you haven't told me?

13:55.334 --> 13:57.670
Well, yeah. There is...
some things I haven't told you,

13:57.753 --> 14:01.423
but not because I was trying to lie.
I know you'll go fucking nuts.

14:01.507 --> 14:04.093
And what things haven't you told me
because I will go fucking nuts?

14:04.677 --> 14:06.762
Promise me you won't go nuts,
and I'll tell you.

14:07.137 --> 14:08.097
Okay, I promise.

14:08.180 --> 14:09.640
You know what?
It's not a big deal,

14:09.723 --> 14:11.475
because we were broken up anyway
but...

14:12.226 --> 14:13.561
I want to tell you this.

14:14.019 --> 14:15.521
I hooked up with someone.

14:17.982 --> 14:20.192
-Oh, is that it?
-Yeah.

14:20.276 --> 14:22.736
You thought I'd go fucking nuts over that?
That's no big deal.

14:22.820 --> 14:24.530
-Okay, good.
-I hooked up with some people, too.

14:25.281 --> 14:26.156
Who?

14:27.658 --> 14:28.909
It doesn't matter, does it?

14:29.577 --> 14:31.579
Actually, know what?
It totally doesn't matter.

14:32.872 --> 14:34.248
Were they, uh...

14:34.331 --> 14:36.542
-were they bigger than me, though...
-Oh, my God, Ricky. Seriously?

14:36.625 --> 14:39.336
It's not like I'm going to ask
if she had nicer tits than me.

14:40.129 --> 14:42.590
-Did she have nicer tits than me?
-Not really.

14:42.673 --> 14:44.174
You know I'm an ass man, anyway, so...

14:44.258 --> 14:47.803
-Oh, so she had a nicer ass than me?
-Oh, my fuck, Susan.

14:47.887 --> 14:50.347
-I didn't fucking say that.
-Who was she?

14:50.514 --> 14:52.016
I thought it didn't matter!

14:54.184 --> 14:55.102
Actually, it doesn't.

14:55.185 --> 14:57.646
-Good. Great.
-As long as it wasn't that bitch, Sarah.

15:02.526 --> 15:04.403
Oh, my fucking fuck!

15:04.486 --> 15:06.906
You fucked Sarah?
Fuck you!

15:08.073 --> 15:09.617
You said you weren't
gonna go fucking nuts

15:09.700 --> 15:11.452
and here you are going
fucking nuts again, Susan!

15:11.535 --> 15:13.203
And you know what?
We didn't even fuck!

15:13.287 --> 15:15.497
It was just a little bit of oral,
for fuck's sakes!

15:15.581 --> 15:18.375
Get the fuck back!
What the fuck is going...? Fuck!

15:18.459 --> 15:19.376
[Julian clearing throat]

15:20.669 --> 15:22.630
Well, I think I'm gonna
have the chicken balls.

15:22.713 --> 15:24.423
-Combo one.
-[Ricky] ...one fucking night!

15:24.506 --> 15:26.759
-We were drunk!
-[Susan] Oral? That makes it better?

15:27.134 --> 15:29.011
[Ricky] It's better than fucking,
actually, right in...

15:29.094 --> 15:30.095
[Susan] ...what?

15:31.430 --> 15:33.349
[Randy] Holy frig, this beer's good.

15:34.099 --> 15:35.059
Damn good!

15:35.809 --> 15:38.854
Then you had to go fucking open
your big fucking mouth, Randy!

15:38.938 --> 15:41.690
How was I supposed to know what to say
and what not to say?

15:41.774 --> 15:42.816
Look, we should have waited

15:43.150 --> 15:44.860
till they agreed to have us on board.

15:45.486 --> 15:48.948
By then, we could have taken them
with a big fucking deal, Randy,

15:49.031 --> 15:52.618
and then all trust issues
would have been fucking eliminated!

15:53.160 --> 15:55.120
Well, that could still
happen, Mr. Lahey.

15:55.204 --> 15:56.455
You fucked her, bud.

15:56.872 --> 15:58.165
You know what I'm gonna do?

15:58.540 --> 16:01.627
I'm gonna go down to
beer bottle Bubble bullshit brewery

16:01.710 --> 16:03.879
and shut the whole fucking thing down!

16:03.963 --> 16:04.964
-[chair clattering]
-Mr. Lahey!

16:05.130 --> 16:05.965
Mr. Lahey.

16:06.465 --> 16:09.677
That's not you, all right?
That's the old Mr. Lahey.

16:09.760 --> 16:10.761
Here, have a seat.

16:11.762 --> 16:14.598
All right? You're not
that person anymore.

16:15.099 --> 16:16.266
Think about it, Mr. Lahey.

16:16.350 --> 16:18.686
Things have been pretty
good around here lately.

16:18.769 --> 16:20.396
-No bullshit!
-[grunt]

16:20.479 --> 16:22.314
You know what?
Suck my cock, Ricky!

16:22.398 --> 16:24.024
-Suck it dry!
-That's fucking nice talk.

16:24.108 --> 16:26.735
[Candy] Did she just tell him
to suck her cock?

16:26.819 --> 16:29.446
-Yeah. She says that all the time.
-Wow.

16:29.863 --> 16:31.532
She doesn't have one, though,
does she?

16:31.615 --> 16:33.784
I don't think so,
but I'm beginning to think she might.

16:33.867 --> 16:34.868
[sighing] Fuck...

16:34.952 --> 16:35.995
Oh, wow.

16:36.161 --> 16:37.788
I didn't expect that to happen.

16:37.871 --> 16:39.832
Most fucked up couple
on the planet.

16:40.124 --> 16:42.835
The guys have started
an honest business

16:42.918 --> 16:44.628
and they're doing
pretty frigging good at it!

16:44.712 --> 16:47.631
Eh, it's lipstick on a shit pig, Randy!

16:48.424 --> 16:49.591
Mr. Lahey,

16:49.842 --> 16:54.596
let's just leave them alone, okay?
And enjoy each other,

16:54.680 --> 16:56.557
alone, no one else.

16:56.640 --> 16:59.393
[George] Oh, there's nothing better than
a day near the beach with a drone.

16:59.476 --> 17:00.477
You should see the footage.

17:00.769 --> 17:03.564
I even got some nice Speedo shots
of these French fellas for you guys.

17:04.772 --> 17:06.316
What, uh,
what are you guys doing here?

17:06.400 --> 17:07.483
Having a little party without me?

17:07.568 --> 17:08.569
What's the occasion?

17:08.986 --> 17:11.446
We're just trying to have
some alone time here, George.

17:14.282 --> 17:16.367
Freedom 35?
That's smooth.

17:17.493 --> 17:18.412
Yeah.

17:18.746 --> 17:20.873
The three shit-keteers
have started their own...

17:21.123 --> 17:23.041
beer bottling brewery.

17:23.250 --> 17:25.586
Randy and I went down,
tried to get involved,

17:25.669 --> 17:28.630
but Bu-Bu-Bu-Bu-Bubbles
shut the fuck down us-us.

17:29.214 --> 17:31.508
Hm. Surveillance from the inside.

17:33.218 --> 17:34.344
That's brilliant, Jim.

17:34.428 --> 17:37.181
We're not doing surveillance from
the inside, George!

17:37.973 --> 17:39.975
Look, they've started a legit business

17:40.059 --> 17:42.644
-and we would like to be involved with it.
-[groaning]

17:42.728 --> 17:45.230
Build something for the park,
for the future.

17:45.314 --> 17:48.400
-[Mr. Lahey] Right.
-Everyone working together on one team.

17:48.484 --> 17:50.652
-[Mr. Lahey] Yeah.
-He's not serious, is he, Jim?

17:50.944 --> 17:51.862
Legit?

17:52.321 --> 17:54.573
You think they're just selling beer
down there?

17:54.990 --> 17:56.366
Give me a fucking break.

17:56.575 --> 17:59.411
Well, I've got no reason to believe
there's anything more.

18:00.245 --> 18:02.998
That's why you're an assistant
trailer park supervisor.

18:03.499 --> 18:06.710
And Jim and I,
we're police officers, Randy.

18:06.794 --> 18:08.253
Well, you're not anymore!

18:08.337 --> 18:10.214
And you're my assistant now,
George!

18:10.297 --> 18:12.299
-Randy!
-You're siding with him?

18:12.382 --> 18:14.635
I'm not siding with anybody,
Randy!

18:14.968 --> 18:18.597
Look... Look reality
in the bum cheeks, Randy!

18:18.680 --> 18:20.432
Think about it for a second.

18:20.766 --> 18:25.229
Why wouldn't Bubbles want us to
get involved in his business?

18:25.687 --> 18:28.023
Because you're a drunk,
Mr. Lahey!

18:29.108 --> 18:31.360
[Randy] Frig's sakes.
Frig off, George.

18:34.738 --> 18:37.241
-You want to get involved, Jim?
-[door slamming]

18:37.574 --> 18:39.827
We can very easily make that happen.

18:40.452 --> 18:42.204
Well, what have you
got in mind, Georgie?

18:42.955 --> 18:45.374
I got a few ideas,
if you're ready to listen.

18:46.416 --> 18:48.752
So how do you think
our relationship's going?

18:49.211 --> 18:51.380
Hm, I think it's going great.
But, you know,

18:51.463 --> 18:53.465
if you don't feel the same way
as me...

18:53.549 --> 18:56.176
that's fine, I get it.
I totally get it, Candy.

18:56.426 --> 18:59.304
Julian, what...
Get what? Get what?

19:00.514 --> 19:02.975
You know, look at you.
You're... beautiful,

19:03.058 --> 19:06.436
you're successful, smart.
And... look at me. I'm...

19:06.520 --> 19:07.855
I'm a loser compared to you.

19:07.938 --> 19:09.398
-Julian...
-No, you've got smart friends.

19:09.481 --> 19:11.275
You might not want to
bring me around them.

19:11.358 --> 19:12.860
I totally get it.
I understand.

19:12.943 --> 19:16.196
What are you talking about?
Understand what?

19:16.488 --> 19:18.031
-All right. I was talking to Ricky.
-Baby...

19:18.115 --> 19:19.575
-I was talking to Ricky, he said...
-Oh, God...

19:19.658 --> 19:21.368
...you were probably gonna
dump me during lunch.

19:21.451 --> 19:22.411
-[scoffing]
-You know...

19:22.494 --> 19:23.537
I'm just paranoid.

19:23.620 --> 19:25.080
-Julian...
-I don't know what to think.

19:25.164 --> 19:27.249
And you're gonna
listen to that guy?

19:27.332 --> 19:29.251
-[indistinct yelling outside]
-[sigh]

19:29.585 --> 19:31.378
Julian, look...

19:31.461 --> 19:33.881
[sigh, clearing throat]

19:34.464 --> 19:36.800
I didn't bring you here
to break up with you.

19:37.009 --> 19:39.636
I brought you here...
[deep breath]

19:39.720 --> 19:41.388
to ask you to marry me.

19:43.473 --> 19:44.933
-What?
-[laughs]

19:45.017 --> 19:46.101
Yes.

19:47.019 --> 19:48.979
[clearing throat]
Julian,

19:49.855 --> 19:51.231
will you marry me?

19:52.065 --> 19:54.151
-Are you fucking serious?
-Yes!

19:54.860 --> 19:57.779
Look, I don't want to
lose you again, baby.

19:59.031 --> 20:00.115
What do you say?

20:00.574 --> 20:04.077
[chuckle, stammering]
Yes! Of course I do!

20:04.161 --> 20:06.330
-Yay!
-[loud smacking]

20:06.413 --> 20:09.124
-Fuck, I love you.
-I love you, too.

20:09.208 --> 20:10.209
I'm getting married, man.

20:10.292 --> 20:11.668
-[applause]
-Yeah, right on.

20:12.336 --> 20:13.378
Thank you.

20:15.797 --> 20:18.091
-Cheers, baby.
-[giggling] Cheers, baby.

20:18.550 --> 20:21.178
You are fucking something else.
Wow.

20:21.678 --> 20:22.846
[exhaling]

20:22.930 --> 20:26.558
Well, that's the operation in a nutshell.
I'm confident I can deliver.

20:26.642 --> 20:28.393
Oh, that is something good.

20:28.936 --> 20:31.188
Now, consistency is key.

20:32.022 --> 20:35.400
You keep it consistent
and it'll continue to sell.

20:36.068 --> 20:37.569
What more can I tell you?

20:37.653 --> 20:41.073
You've got a good thing going here,
real good.

20:41.156 --> 20:43.367
Well, you don't have to worry
about a thing, Big Hawk.

20:43.575 --> 20:45.118
Look, my middle
name's consistency.

20:45.202 --> 20:48.121
That's what people around here call me,
Bubbles Consistency!

20:48.205 --> 20:49.456
[laughter]

20:49.539 --> 20:53.168
Look, I'm very, very happy to be
doing business with you, Big Hawk.

20:53.252 --> 20:55.504
[clearing throat]
Look, if things go good,

20:55.587 --> 20:58.006
I might even let you
start calling me just...

20:58.257 --> 20:59.258
The Hawk.

20:59.591 --> 21:01.301
Oh, that would be awesome.

21:01.385 --> 21:03.345
-That would be awesome.
-[chuckling]

21:03.428 --> 21:06.014
-Big Hawk's out.
-All right.

21:06.098 --> 21:07.849
[quietly] Oh, yes!

21:07.933 --> 21:10.185
Yes! Did you guys fucking see that?

21:10.477 --> 21:11.895
Holy fuck!

21:11.979 --> 21:13.313
[buttons clicking]

21:13.397 --> 21:14.815
Come on Julian, pick up.

21:15.190 --> 21:16.483
Pick up.

21:17.025 --> 21:18.819
Julian, call me back right away!

21:18.902 --> 21:21.989
Holy fuck, the deal's real,
and it's done, baby!

21:22.072 --> 21:23.490
You should have saw me fucking

21:23.573 --> 21:25.075
-wheeling dealing with Big Hawk.
-[man] Sir.

21:25.158 --> 21:26.660
-It was unbeliev...
-Sir.

21:26.743 --> 21:28.370
Just hang on.
I'll call you back.

21:28.537 --> 21:30.414
-Is your name Bubbles?
-What's that?

21:30.497 --> 21:31.665
Is your name Bubbles?

21:32.040 --> 21:34.543
Uh, it might be.
Who's asking?

21:34.626 --> 21:36.295
Ryan Duggins,
I work for the city.

21:36.378 --> 21:37.212
You're hereby ordered to

21:37.296 --> 21:39.339
cease productions and operations
immediately, sir.

21:39.423 --> 21:41.550
What?!
What are you talking about?

21:41.633 --> 21:43.844
That's a fucking legitimate business.

21:43.927 --> 21:46.430
That's registered business.
It's 100% legit.

21:46.513 --> 21:50.517
-I'll get my registration papers!
-Sir... it's not necessary.

21:50.600 --> 21:53.687
We're aware of the registration.
It's not a registration issue.

21:53.770 --> 21:56.898
I'm actually kind of not sure how this
business was registered to start with.

21:56.982 --> 21:58.317
This is a zoning issue.

21:58.567 --> 22:00.944
Sunnyvale Trailer Park
is not commercially zoned.

22:01.320 --> 22:03.488
Well, that's not
my fucking problem, is it?

22:03.572 --> 22:06.074
-I did what I was supposed to do.
-[Duggins] Listen, sir,

22:06.158 --> 22:08.410
we're gonna be checking up on you
quite regularly.

22:08.493 --> 22:09.453
[stapler clicking]

22:09.536 --> 22:12.581
This is a... pretty elaborate set-up.

22:13.123 --> 22:15.208
I'm surprised we just had one complaint.

22:16.251 --> 22:18.086
Oh, a fucking notice?

22:19.296 --> 22:21.173
One complaint you had, eh?

22:21.256 --> 22:23.342
Yeah, I fucking wonder who that was!

22:23.425 --> 22:25.427
[sobbing]

22:25.510 --> 22:28.597
[clattering]

22:28.680 --> 22:30.807
Fucking dirty son of a whore!

22:30.891 --> 22:32.225
-[sobbing]
-[Randy] Bubbles...

22:32.309 --> 22:33.685
You couldn't fucking
leave well enough alone!

22:33.769 --> 22:36.646
You had to come fuck everything up
on me, didn't you?

22:37.898 --> 22:39.775
I don't know what the fuck
you're talking about.

22:39.858 --> 22:41.735
Oh, yeah, you don't know what
I'm talking about!

22:41.902 --> 22:45.697
You called the fucking city
and had my whole business shut down!

22:45.781 --> 22:47.032
You miserable prick!

22:47.115 --> 22:48.492
-It wasn't me, Bubbles.
-Oh, yeah.

22:48.575 --> 22:50.535
-It wasn't fucking...
-[George] Who were you talking to Bubbles?

22:50.619 --> 22:53.038
I don't know, some lizard-y looking
little fuck!

22:53.330 --> 22:55.749
-Hoggins or Doggins or something!
-Oh...

22:55.832 --> 22:58.001
Ryan "Do Anybody" Duggins.
Yeah, I know him well.

22:58.668 --> 22:59.669
Oh, big surprise.

22:59.753 --> 23:02.130
You know the fucking big mean guy
from the city.

23:02.631 --> 23:04.591
Listen, I can help you out.

23:04.841 --> 23:05.842
It'll just take a call.

23:06.510 --> 23:08.428
Oh yeah, you'd do that for me,
would you, George?

23:08.512 --> 23:11.098
You're gonna make a call and
fucking make everything better?

23:11.389 --> 23:12.974
-Yeah, I will.
-[whimpering]

23:13.058 --> 23:15.727
-But it'll cost you.
-Yeah? What's it gonna cost me?

23:16.144 --> 23:18.688
Well, the only way I see the city
going for it is, uh,

23:18.772 --> 23:20.065
if our names are attached to it.

23:20.148 --> 23:21.566
-Mine and Jim's.
-Oh, yeah.

23:21.650 --> 23:22.609
-Yeah?
-[Randy] Mr. Lahey!

23:22.692 --> 23:23.610
[mocking tone] Randy!

23:23.693 --> 23:25.529
You think that's fucking fair, do you?

23:25.612 --> 23:27.155
You just fucking come in

23:27.322 --> 23:31.243
and take part of my fucking heart
and soul for doing fucking nothing?

23:31.326 --> 23:33.537
-I don't fucking think so, baby!
-[clattering]

23:33.620 --> 23:34.538
-[whimpering]
-Bubbles...

23:34.621 --> 23:36.289
That's bullshit.
That's bullshit.

23:36.748 --> 23:39.042
I am willing to make
all your dreams happen

23:39.126 --> 23:40.669
for just a small crumb of the pie.

23:40.752 --> 23:43.380
I promise I'm going to steer
the old shit ship straight, Bubbles.

23:43.463 --> 23:44.923
-No fucking bullshit!
-Oh, yeah.

23:45.006 --> 23:47.968
-All you have to do is just team up...
-Look, it would be a shame...

23:48.051 --> 23:51.138
-We can make your fucking business...
-[overlapping conversation]

23:51.221 --> 23:53.431
I've got hundreds of
contacts from my days...

23:53.515 --> 23:55.725
[Randy yelling]
Would you guys just leave him alone?

23:55.809 --> 23:57.602
Get your fucking greasy hands off me,

23:57.686 --> 23:59.354
you fucking humpback shit whale!

23:59.646 --> 24:00.564
You want to fucking go?

24:00.647 --> 24:01.857
-I'll go with you!
-Let's fucking go!

24:01.940 --> 24:03.316
I'll take the pants off right now!

24:03.400 --> 24:05.235
Come on, right fucking now!
Let's go!

24:05.318 --> 24:09.030
I'm not signing anything!
Everybody just shut the fuck up!

24:09.114 --> 24:11.616
[moaning, panting]

24:14.244 --> 24:16.121
These are your options, Bubbles.

24:16.413 --> 24:18.999
-Take it or leave it.
-[panting]

24:19.082 --> 24:21.251
[whimper]
Yeah, you know what?

24:22.460 --> 24:24.254
You know what... George?

24:24.337 --> 24:26.715
I'd rather have no fucking business

24:27.257 --> 24:29.134
and still have my fucking friends

24:29.217 --> 24:32.012
than team up with you fucking shit balls.

24:32.095 --> 24:33.471
Fucking assholes!

24:34.055 --> 24:35.098
[slap]

24:35.182 --> 24:36.474
There, Randy,
I knocked your burger.

24:36.558 --> 24:38.643
Here, sorry, here.
Have another one.

24:38.727 --> 24:40.020
-I'm sorry about that.
-[slap]

24:40.103 --> 24:42.480
Bubbles!
Frig off!

24:43.982 --> 24:45.942
Friggin' perfectly good burgers...

24:46.026 --> 24:48.069
You sure you won't consider, Bubbles?

24:48.695 --> 24:50.739
Jim, we'll work on it.

24:51.990 --> 24:53.408
[Bubbles] Hey, Big Hawk?

24:53.491 --> 24:56.953
Hey, it's Bubbles here.
Listen, I... got some bad news.

24:57.037 --> 24:59.706
I know I told you my
middle name was Consistency.

24:59.789 --> 25:03.668
I should have told you my middle name's
The Big Fucking Letdown Guy.

25:03.835 --> 25:05.170
I got shut down by the city.

25:05.253 --> 25:07.255
I'm not gonna be able
to deliver that beer.

25:07.714 --> 25:09.049
I'm sorry, bud.

25:09.716 --> 25:12.385
The Hawk.
[whimper]

25:13.511 --> 25:16.765
[Julian] Bubs! Get over here, man,
I got some good news.

25:16.848 --> 25:18.767
Yeah, well we've got to have
a business meeting, Julian.

25:18.850 --> 25:21.061
No, we're getting drunk tonight and
celebrating, buddy.

25:21.311 --> 25:22.229
No, I don't think so.

25:22.312 --> 25:24.314
-Business meeting.
-Just hang on for a minute.

25:24.397 --> 25:25.482
Fuckbrains got engaged.

25:25.565 --> 25:28.276
Ricky, what the fuck are you doing?
I wanted to tell him myself, man.

25:28.360 --> 25:29.236
What? Engaged?

25:29.319 --> 25:31.112
What do you mean en...
Like to get married?

25:31.196 --> 25:32.906
-Yes!
-We're getting married, man.

25:33.448 --> 25:35.033
Oh, my fuck. Well...

25:35.408 --> 25:38.119
Congratulations.
A little bit sudden, don't you think?

25:38.203 --> 25:40.247
Well, sudden's one word,
fucked is another one.

25:40.330 --> 25:42.332
I don't think it's fucked,
I think it's romantic.

25:42.415 --> 25:45.126
-Yeah, romantic.
-You know what's not romantic?

25:45.210 --> 25:47.837
The thought of you banging Sarah
going around and 'round in my head.

25:47.921 --> 25:49.214
Oh, Jesus fucking Christ!

25:49.297 --> 25:51.299
You've just got to keep bringing this up
fucking constantly?

25:51.383 --> 25:53.385
You just told me about it an hour ago!

25:53.468 --> 25:56.012
And yeah, maybe I am!
You know?

25:56.471 --> 25:58.473
I... I thought I could deal with it.
I don't think I can.

25:58.556 --> 25:59.891
What the fuck
am I supposed to do?

25:59.975 --> 26:02.060
If you can't fucking get over it,
maybe we should move on.

26:02.143 --> 26:05.772
Yeah, but I want to be with you, Ricky.
I love your dumb ass, you fucking idiot.

26:05.855 --> 26:07.732
Maybe... maybe if you
committed to me,

26:07.816 --> 26:09.359
I could get rid of these images of

26:09.442 --> 26:11.236
-her blowing you...
-Oh, my God...

26:11.319 --> 26:13.363
...and you mowing down
on her dirty red box.

26:13.446 --> 26:15.532
What the fuck are you saying?
If I commit to you,

26:15.615 --> 26:16.992
and we get married,
engaged and shit,

26:17.075 --> 26:19.077
that you can finally forget
about this shit?

26:20.203 --> 26:22.706
-Yeah, maybe I am.
-Oh, my fucking God!

26:22.789 --> 26:24.874
-That's all it's going to take, is it?
-Yeah.

26:24.958 --> 26:25.875
Fine.

26:26.334 --> 26:29.212
-Will you for to be fucking married to me?

26:31.423 --> 26:32.257
[Ricky] Well, great then,

26:32.340 --> 26:34.050

married then, aren't we?

26:34.134 --> 26:35.885
-Yeah, I guess we fucking are.
-All right.

26:35.969 --> 26:38.430
