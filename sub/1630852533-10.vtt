WEBVTT

00:02.370 --> 00:06.005
You got some angry
[bleep] people down here.

00:06.007 --> 00:07.873
Yeah. I wanna flip the table.

00:09.076 --> 00:12.211
That is [bleep] crazy.

00:12.213 --> 00:14.446
-Oh, my God.
-What?

00:14.448 --> 00:17.783
I just saw a shadow
right here.

00:21.222 --> 00:22.321
You guys.

00:22.323 --> 00:23.856
-[Chip] It's fear.
-[Amy] Mom.

00:23.858 --> 00:25.591
-[Chip] It's anger.
-Stop it.

00:25.593 --> 00:26.658
No.

00:26.660 --> 00:27.926
[Chip] There's no escape.

00:27.928 --> 00:29.261
[Amy] I've gotta
get out of here.

00:29.263 --> 00:31.697
We're in control
of the situation right now.

00:32.533 --> 00:33.565
No.

00:36.370 --> 00:38.237
<i>  The dead want a voice.</i>

00:38.239 --> 00:39.405
We just wanna help
this family.

00:39.407 --> 00:41.106
<i> [Adam] The living need</i>
<i>  our help.</i>

00:41.108 --> 00:43.375
-Have you always been here?
-He was watching already.

00:43.377 --> 00:46.278
[ominous music playing]

00:52.353 --> 00:55.387
[ominous music playing]

01:08.969 --> 01:11.570
[Amy] We're gonna need
more people, this is massive.

01:11.572 --> 01:13.605
[Adam] Oh, my God.

01:18.646 --> 01:22.147
Welcome to
the Sheboygan Asylum.

01:23.517 --> 01:27.219
<i>  Six wings,</i>
<i>  multiple floors, tunnels.</i>

01:27.221 --> 01:30.255
<i> [Amy] This place used to house</i>
<i>  hundreds of people at a time.</i>

01:30.257 --> 01:32.057
<i>  There have been</i>
<i>  a few tragedies here.</i>

01:32.059 --> 01:33.926
I think that's important
because a lot of the activity

01:33.928 --> 01:36.462
they're experiencing sounds
kind of crazy.

01:37.965 --> 01:40.732
The activity
has ramped up lately.

01:40.734 --> 01:43.235
Craig who we're meeting
leads investigations

01:43.237 --> 01:45.337
here on the weekends
and is very concerned.

01:45.339 --> 01:47.172
People are literally
getting attacked...

01:47.174 --> 01:49.541
-Oh, God.
-They're seeing
a lot of shadow figures,

01:49.543 --> 01:52.644
people feel
like oppressed and scared.

01:52.646 --> 01:54.746
These are the kinds of places
that we dream about.

01:54.748 --> 01:57.082
[Adam] I know, I can't wait.

01:57.084 --> 01:58.550
-[Amy] All right.
Let's go meet Craig...
-[Adam] Craig, right?

01:58.552 --> 02:00.385
[Amy] ...and find out
what's happening.

02:01.388 --> 02:03.489
-[Adam] Hey, Craig.
-[Amy] Wow,

02:03.491 --> 02:04.857
this is quite the place.

02:04.859 --> 02:06.024
-Are you Adam?
-Good.

02:06.026 --> 02:07.693
-Hi, I'm Amy, good to meet.
-Nice to meet you.

02:07.695 --> 02:10.362
Can you give us
like a high level overview

02:10.364 --> 02:13.031
of like the history of where
we're standing right now?

02:13.033 --> 02:14.800
Well, you're in
the Sheboygan Asylum.

02:14.802 --> 02:17.336
It was actually built in 1939.

02:17.338 --> 02:19.037
In the beginning, it was like,

02:19.039 --> 02:21.540
uh, a assisted living
for the clinically insane.

02:21.542 --> 02:23.575
[Amy] And so how
many people would be housed

02:23.577 --> 02:25.777
-in here at one time?
-At the most there's 300

02:25.779 --> 02:28.180
-at one time, yeah.
-It's actually really big

02:28.182 --> 02:29.781
-for 300 people, isn't it?
-[Adam] Yeah.

02:29.783 --> 02:32.451
Yup. 275,000 square feet,
it was, uh, yeah.

02:32.453 --> 02:34.419
-[Amy] That's massive.
-[Adam] Yeah.

02:34.421 --> 02:35.854
When did this place
close down?

02:35.856 --> 02:37.122
In 2002.

02:37.124 --> 02:38.557
[Amy] Oh, so not
that long ago.

02:38.559 --> 02:41.026
So we know that other people
have investigated, right?

02:41.028 --> 02:43.462
-[Craig] Yes.
-And something
has changed recently.

02:43.464 --> 02:46.632
-And that's why
we're here, right?
-Yes. Um, last year,

02:46.634 --> 02:48.567
we opened up the morgue.

02:48.569 --> 02:50.736
-Oh.
-[Craig] Basically put, like,

02:50.738 --> 02:52.337
a hole in the wall,
took the bricks out.

02:52.339 --> 02:54.706
And something came out
of that morgue.

02:54.708 --> 02:57.910
Because that night
when we had the morgue open,

02:57.912 --> 03:01.446
there was, uh,
like, something following me.

03:01.448 --> 03:03.448
-I could feel it.
-Whatever you did

03:03.450 --> 03:06.451
caused them to, like, wake up?

03:06.453 --> 03:08.387
Yeah. I would say
that, wake up. Yeah.

03:08.389 --> 03:11.456
And two of our guests there
that night

03:11.458 --> 03:13.926
were scratched and one guy
even got punched in the eye,

03:13.928 --> 03:16.094
-left a bruise.
-[both] Oh, my gosh.

03:16.096 --> 03:18.130
So, yup. And recently,

03:18.132 --> 03:20.365
I've been tormented
in the living quarters

03:20.367 --> 03:23.302
by something that would be
constantly pulling my shirt.

03:23.304 --> 03:25.070
I just always feel
like I'm followed

03:25.072 --> 03:26.538
when I'm in the building
by something

03:26.540 --> 03:28.173
that's not quite right.

03:28.175 --> 03:30.275
Well, I feel like we have
a lot of ground to cover,

03:30.277 --> 03:32.110
so maybe you want to start
walking us around?

03:32.112 --> 03:33.278
[Craig] Yeah.

03:38.018 --> 03:40.219
[Adam] So we're
on the second floor?

03:40.221 --> 03:41.787
[Craig] Yup. These are
just patient rooms. So...

03:41.789 --> 03:43.121
What happens up here?

03:43.123 --> 03:44.790
Loud bangs and knocks.

03:44.792 --> 03:47.226
Voices. You'll actually
see shadows of like,

03:47.228 --> 03:49.928
apparitions darting
in and out of the rooms.

03:49.930 --> 03:51.763
-And where should we go?
-We'll go this way.

03:51.765 --> 03:53.398
[Amy] Okay.

03:53.400 --> 03:55.100
[Craig] So living quarters
are this way.

03:55.102 --> 03:56.602
Nurses area up there,

03:56.604 --> 03:57.736
where they stayed
is up that way.

03:57.738 --> 03:59.705
Do you have any activity up
in that section?

03:59.707 --> 04:01.707
-[Craig] Lots of activity
up there, yup.
-Lots.

04:01.709 --> 04:03.675
[Amy] So living quarters,
so this is where like

04:03.677 --> 04:05.677
-the doctors and staff lived?
-[Craig] Yup.

04:07.815 --> 04:09.481
So, this was
wherever I had the,

04:09.483 --> 04:11.250
-uh, something touching me...
-[Amy] Mmm-hmm.

04:11.252 --> 04:13.018
[Craig] ...pulling my shirt.

04:13.020 --> 04:14.686
And it always feels
like something follows you.

04:14.688 --> 04:16.755
I was here last night,
I felt something

04:16.757 --> 04:18.457
-following us out of here.
-[Amy] Wow.

04:18.459 --> 04:19.992
-Could hear footsteps.
-[Adam] This is wild.

04:19.994 --> 04:21.994
So where does it
follow you to?

04:21.996 --> 04:24.129
Follows me back out
to the main entrance there.

04:24.131 --> 04:26.765
Okay, but it doesn't
go home with you?

04:26.767 --> 04:29.301
-It just stays...
-[Craig] It hasn't gone home
with me yet. No.

04:29.303 --> 04:31.603
-[Amy] You wanna check
the nurse's area?
-[Adam] Yeah, definitely.

04:31.605 --> 04:33.672
Wow, this is wild.

04:36.010 --> 04:39.011
This place is so spooky.

04:39.013 --> 04:40.646
[Amy] So this is
where the nurses stay?

04:40.648 --> 04:44.283
Nurses all stayed. Now,
there is a particular room

04:44.285 --> 04:46.285
where a nurse
hung herself with a sheet.

04:46.287 --> 04:48.387
Ooh, okay.

04:48.389 --> 04:50.622
-And this is documented?
-[Craig] Yup.

04:50.624 --> 04:52.291
[Amy] Okay.

04:52.293 --> 04:54.059
And that was
that room right there.

04:56.130 --> 04:57.963
[Adam] Wow, I know
there's a there's a...

04:57.965 --> 05:00.232
There's definitely a newspaper
article about the...

05:01.235 --> 05:03.201
the lady
who suffocated, right?

05:03.203 --> 05:04.836
[Craig] Yes.

05:04.838 --> 05:06.505
[Amy] Was that a nurse or...

05:06.507 --> 05:08.106
[Craig] That was a nurse too,
according to one

05:08.108 --> 05:09.741
of the other nurses
that stayed here.

05:09.743 --> 05:12.177
They found a nurse,
uh, in the bathtub too.

05:12.179 --> 05:14.546
I mean, that's what?
Three documented nurses.

05:14.548 --> 05:16.581
-[Craig] Yeah.
-[Amy] All right. That's...

05:17.718 --> 05:19.685
[Craig] These hallways
is where some of our guests

05:19.687 --> 05:21.086
have gotten violently sick

05:21.088 --> 05:23.355
and had to go down
and get air.

05:23.357 --> 05:25.891
You get footsteps in here,
you get disembodied voices

05:25.893 --> 05:27.492
while we were cleaning up,
up here,

05:27.494 --> 05:29.027
we had a couple
people screaming.

05:29.029 --> 05:30.729
-Really.
-That you could actually
hear him screaming

05:30.731 --> 05:32.197
and it didn't come
from outside.

05:32.199 --> 05:33.498
-Okay.
-[Adam] That's terrifying.

05:33.500 --> 05:35.033
I don't wanna hear, like,

05:35.035 --> 05:37.502
disembodied screams
from an asylum.

05:37.504 --> 05:39.204
[Amy] I know.

05:39.206 --> 05:40.939
-Where should we go next?
-[Craig] The basement,

05:40.941 --> 05:42.307
just saved the best for last.

05:47.581 --> 05:49.581
We're gonna go through here
to the morgue.

05:51.051 --> 05:52.718
[Adam] So you broke down
the wall in here.

05:52.720 --> 05:55.654
-[Craig] Yes.
-[Adam] And something
unleashed?

05:55.656 --> 05:58.056
[Craig] Well, pretty much
all hell broke loose.

05:59.560 --> 06:01.727
[Adam] You were the one
who was like,

06:01.729 --> 06:04.396
"I'm gonna take this down."
You led the charge for this.

06:04.398 --> 06:06.832
It was your idea. And now
you're getting picked on.

06:06.834 --> 06:08.633
And now I'm getting
picked on for it.

06:08.635 --> 06:10.769
And this is just every time
you're in the building

06:10.771 --> 06:13.138
-or certain times?
-[Craig] It seems
at random sometimes.

06:13.140 --> 06:15.340
-Yeah.
-Last week that we were here,

06:15.342 --> 06:18.076
uh, I got like this
stabbing feeling in my chest.

06:18.078 --> 06:19.711
I'm thinking, "Oh, my God,
am I having a heart attack?"

06:19.713 --> 06:21.713
So I left the building,
got some air,

06:21.715 --> 06:23.382
and it felt
a whole lot better.

06:23.384 --> 06:24.649
And I started feeling better.

06:24.651 --> 06:27.486
Okay, so I mean, this is
causing you physical pain...

06:27.488 --> 06:29.755
-[Craig] Yeah.
-...at this point. Okay.

06:29.757 --> 06:31.890
It gets even weirder
where the chapel is.

06:31.892 --> 06:33.558
-[Amy] Can we go there?
-[Craig] Yeah.

06:33.560 --> 06:34.526
Wow.

06:37.364 --> 06:39.264
[Amy] Okay, so chapel.

06:39.266 --> 06:42.134
I was standing here and I got
scratched on the back,

06:42.136 --> 06:44.569
<i>  three scratches.</i>
<i>  Enough, they were red,</i>

06:44.571 --> 06:46.238
<i>  the bumps were raised up.</i>

06:46.240 --> 06:48.240
<i>  And at the same time,</i>
<i>  I felt like,</i>

06:48.242 --> 06:50.909
uh, somebody just went, wham,
right on the back of my back.

06:50.911 --> 06:53.211
And that was there too.
So that was the same night

06:53.213 --> 06:54.946
we opened up the morgue.

06:54.948 --> 06:56.481
Something really had
it out for you that night.

06:56.483 --> 06:58.283
-Yeah.
-[Amy] Do you think
that whatever is here

06:58.285 --> 07:01.386
reacts when people are afraid,
like it enjoys that?

07:01.388 --> 07:02.821
[Craig] I think
it preys on their fear.

07:02.823 --> 07:04.289
-[Amy] You do? Okay.
-[Craig] Mmm-hmm.

07:04.291 --> 07:07.125
[Amy] What are you hoping
that we'll be able
to accomplish?

07:07.127 --> 07:08.994
Find out what's after me.
This is the only place

07:08.996 --> 07:11.563
I've been, where I've had
such ill feelings

07:11.565 --> 07:13.665
of being sick or being stabbed

07:13.667 --> 07:17.002
by something. Never had that
anywhere I've gone before.

07:17.004 --> 07:19.371
I'd like to know what came
out of the morgue.

07:19.373 --> 07:20.872
-[Adam] Okay, all right.
-[Amy] Mmm-hmm. Okay.

07:20.874 --> 07:23.508
-[Adam] We should go.
-[Amy] Yeah,
we got to get started.

07:23.510 --> 07:26.344
<i>  Craig and his team lead</i>
<i>  regular investigations here</i>

07:26.346 --> 07:29.347
<i>  and have a good sense</i>
<i>  on normal levels of activity.</i>

07:29.349 --> 07:31.683
<i>  It's especially strange</i>
<i>  that things took such</i>

07:31.685 --> 07:34.386
<i>  an intense turn once</i>
<i>  that wall was torn down.</i>

07:34.388 --> 07:37.022
<i>  And it's even stranger</i>
<i>  that this drastic activity</i>

07:37.024 --> 07:38.790
<i>  isn't isolated in the morgue.</i>

07:38.792 --> 07:40.892
We need to retrace this
<i> thing's steps.</i>

07:40.894 --> 07:43.462
[Adam] Do we want
to start on the bottom floor?

07:43.464 --> 07:46.164
Yeah, I think we start
where it all started,

07:46.166 --> 07:47.966
-head to the morgue.
-Yeah, and see if we can get

07:47.968 --> 07:50.135
anything to communicate
with us.

07:50.137 --> 07:53.071
[ominous music playing]

07:58.412 --> 08:01.413
[Adam] Well, I'm gonna hang
the EMF tripwire here.

08:02.449 --> 08:05.584
Because if anything
comes out of that...

08:06.987 --> 08:08.119
[Amy] That's weird.

08:11.492 --> 08:14.159
Are you making these light up?

08:19.099 --> 08:20.832
I'm gonna put them
inside the morgue.

08:22.803 --> 08:25.070
[Amy] There's no power
running through this.

08:25.072 --> 08:27.405
[Adam] No. I mean...

08:29.676 --> 08:34.112
It is almost, like some energy
is, like, off right here.

08:34.114 --> 08:37.115
It's weird that it's just
around that doorway.

08:37.117 --> 08:39.284
Yeah, and it doesn't...
I mean...

08:39.286 --> 08:42.687
[Amy] It's not a K2.
K2 is a radio,

08:42.689 --> 08:44.122
do we have the other EMF?

08:45.592 --> 08:48.793
-Yeah, the other EMF.
-Yeah. The other EMF.

08:48.795 --> 08:50.962
Here, I'll stand in there
during EVP sessions,

08:50.964 --> 08:52.964
let's see what happens,
standing out there.

08:52.966 --> 08:54.432
Yeah. I mean, I'm gonna see
if I can get that other EMF.

08:54.434 --> 08:57.469
[ominous music playing]

08:58.505 --> 09:01.840
So whoever is in here
with me right now,

09:01.842 --> 09:04.976
I'm by myself for a minute
while my friend goes upstairs.

09:04.978 --> 09:07.579
What room am I
standing in right now?

09:10.384 --> 09:13.552
Is this actually
what used to be the morgue?

09:17.224 --> 09:19.524
Was this your hiding spot?

09:22.796 --> 09:24.563
What is this place called?

09:27.801 --> 09:29.801
Do you want our help
with something?

09:32.406 --> 09:35.740
I'm gonna wait for Adam to
come back and we'll listen
to that.

09:40.247 --> 09:43.548
So while you were up there,
I did an EVP session

09:43.550 --> 09:46.084
by myself in the morgue.
So, I... But I waited for you

09:46.086 --> 09:47.352
-to listen to it.
-Okay.

09:47.354 --> 09:48.820
<i> [Amy] I'm by myself</i>
<i>  for a minute</i>

09:48.822 --> 09:50.488
<i>  while my friend</i>
<i>  goes upstairs.</i>

09:50.490 --> 09:52.557
<i>  What room am I</i>
<i>  standing in right now?</i>

09:53.694 --> 09:55.427
Is that saying "Morgue"?

09:55.429 --> 09:57.596
-Weird. It's one syllable.
-It says...

09:57.598 --> 09:59.331
<i> [Amy] ...right now,</i>
<i>  I'm by myself for a minute</i>

09:59.333 --> 10:01.132
<i>  while my friend</i>
<i>  goes upstairs.</i>

10:01.134 --> 10:03.201
<i>  What rom am I</i>
<i>  standing in right now?</i>

10:04.371 --> 10:06.471
<i>  Is this actually...</i>

10:06.473 --> 10:08.273
-[Adam] It sounds aggressive.
-Yeah.

10:08.275 --> 10:09.741
Like... [makes sound]

10:12.346 --> 10:15.347
[ominous music playing]

10:18.719 --> 10:20.752
<i> [Amy] What is this</i>
<i>  place called?</i>

10:23.490 --> 10:25.924
-What? That was like a...
-[Adam] Yeah, it sounds like

10:25.926 --> 10:27.292
-there's something...
-Uh-huh.

10:27.294 --> 10:29.027
-Like... [gibberish]
-Yeah.

10:29.029 --> 10:30.629
Like whispering
the whole time.

10:30.631 --> 10:31.730
<i> [Amy] What is this</i>
<i>  place called?</i>

10:31.732 --> 10:34.099
[man speaking]

10:34.101 --> 10:36.601
What is this place called?
It repeats me.

10:36.603 --> 10:39.904
-Yeah.
-[both] What is this
place called?

10:41.074 --> 10:43.074
<i> [Amy] You want our help</i>
<i>  with something?</i>

10:44.411 --> 10:46.077
-Did it say no?
-No.

10:46.079 --> 10:48.713
-It doesn't want our help.
-I guess my gut is telling me

10:48.715 --> 10:50.682
whoever is in this space

10:50.684 --> 10:53.418
either doesn't know
how to communicate or...

10:53.420 --> 10:55.620
-Isn't ready to.
-[Adam] Isn't...
Like will not.

10:55.622 --> 10:58.189
Mmm-hmm. Shall we take
a quick crack

10:58.191 --> 10:59.891
-at the living quarters?
-Yeah.

11:01.795 --> 11:04.329
[Amy] Okay. Living quarters.

11:04.331 --> 11:06.765
[Adam] That was the only other
spot where he was like...

11:06.767 --> 11:08.600
-[Amy] Physically...
-[Adam] ...people felt

11:08.602 --> 11:10.835
-physically ill
and stuff, right?
-[Amy] Yeah.

11:10.837 --> 11:12.170
[Adam] Hello.

11:13.206 --> 11:14.906
I definitely get
a weird vibe in here.

11:16.510 --> 11:18.143
Is anyone home?

11:19.246 --> 11:22.147
We're trying to get
as many details as possible

11:22.149 --> 11:24.916
about these incidents
with Craig.

11:24.918 --> 11:27.819
He's been scratched,
he's been punched,

11:29.322 --> 11:32.023
he's had pains in his chest.

11:34.027 --> 11:36.027
So who's doing that to him?

11:38.498 --> 11:42.467
Can you let us know
that you're here somehow?

11:46.506 --> 11:49.374
-Are you hearing footsteps?
-[Adam] Yeah, yes.

11:51.478 --> 11:53.411
I felt something
following us out of here.

11:53.413 --> 11:55.246
Could hear footsteps.

11:56.550 --> 11:58.416
[Adam] Is that you
walking around?

12:02.189 --> 12:04.089
I wanna listen to this
recording now.

12:04.091 --> 12:06.591
<i> [Amy] We're trying</i>
<i>  to get as many details</i>

12:06.593 --> 12:09.994
<i>  as possible about</i>
<i>  these incidents with Craig.</i>

12:09.996 --> 12:13.431
<i>  We wanna make sure the right</i>
<i>  person is held accountable,</i>

12:13.433 --> 12:15.567
<i>  or we want to make sure</i>
<i>  that they're just not</i>

12:15.569 --> 12:18.203
<i>  being misunderstood.</i>
<i>  So this is your chance.</i>

12:18.705 --> 12:21.606
[man] [indistinct]

12:23.777 --> 12:25.310
-What is that?
-[Amy] Hmm.

12:25.779 --> 12:27.011
<i> [Adam] Yeah.</i>

12:27.013 --> 12:28.413
[Amy] It's when we heard
the footsteps too.

12:28.415 --> 12:30.348
-Wow.
-Can you let us know
that you're here?

12:30.350 --> 12:32.984
-And then we heard footsteps.
-[Adam] Yeah. And then...

12:32.986 --> 12:36.054
[indistinct chatter
on recording]

12:37.257 --> 12:39.924
Something's talking,
but then the footsteps happen

12:39.926 --> 12:42.160
at the same time.

12:42.162 --> 12:45.497
So is that them
showing us they're here?

12:45.499 --> 12:48.032
They're like,
"Yeah, we're here. Footsteps."

12:48.034 --> 12:50.034
[Adam] Wow.

12:50.036 --> 12:52.504
Should we go out to the center
and just kind of stand

12:52.506 --> 12:54.105
and see if we can
hear anything else?

13:08.355 --> 13:09.988
Which way should we go?

13:13.627 --> 13:14.793
Wait.

13:18.865 --> 13:20.598
I heard something
in that direction.

13:20.600 --> 13:22.634
I heard something way off
in the distance.

13:22.636 --> 13:24.202
[Adam] Way down, right?

13:25.205 --> 13:26.938
-Like for real.
-[Amy] Like a knock.

13:28.008 --> 13:30.475
Is this how they mess
with us though?

13:30.477 --> 13:33.378
Is this when we fall
into one of those traps of...

13:34.681 --> 13:37.448
But here's the thing, it's
like, let them play the game,

13:37.450 --> 13:39.184
let them lead
the way for a minute

13:39.186 --> 13:41.452
and then we can bring out
the big ideas tomorrow.

13:42.455 --> 13:44.355
I mean,
what's exciting though,

13:45.625 --> 13:47.258
is we can get Chip
in person tomorrow.

13:47.260 --> 13:50.061
I know, this is
the place we need it most.

13:50.063 --> 13:51.763
-Let's, um...
-[Adam] Let it simmer.

13:51.765 --> 13:56.034
[Amy] ...regroup
and make plans.

13:58.038 --> 14:00.104
[Adam] Something
is definitely here.

14:01.174 --> 14:03.241
<i> [Amy] There is something here</i>
<i>  that does want</i>

14:03.243 --> 14:05.543
<i>  to make itself known.</i>
<i>  But now it's kind of putting</i>

14:05.545 --> 14:06.778
<i>  together that puzzle.</i>

14:06.780 --> 14:08.947
How can we get
more information from it?

14:08.949 --> 14:10.782
Like more identifiable
information?

14:10.784 --> 14:12.884
So many people
came through those doors.

14:12.886 --> 14:14.986
<i>  Is it an old patient</i>
<i>  who never left,</i>

14:14.988 --> 14:16.821
<i>  a nurse who devoted</i>
<i>  their whole life</i>

14:16.823 --> 14:18.990
<i>  to this place</i>
<i>  or even took their life here,</i>

14:18.992 --> 14:20.725
<i>  or could it be</i>
<i>  all of the above?</i>

14:20.727 --> 14:22.560
<i>  And what was it</i>
<i>  about opening up that morgue</i>

14:22.562 --> 14:23.995
<i>  that set these spirits off?</i>

14:23.997 --> 14:26.297
<i>  One of the biggest hurdles</i>
<i>  with a location</i>

14:26.299 --> 14:28.132
<i>  like this is its size.</i>

14:28.134 --> 14:29.734
<i>  Adam and I</i>
<i>  are just two people</i>

14:29.736 --> 14:31.803
<i>  and we can't always</i>
<i>  cover a place</i>

14:31.805 --> 14:34.072
<i>  like this by ourselves.</i>
<i>  So thankfully,</i>

14:34.074 --> 14:35.673
<i>  we have Chip Coffey</i>
<i>  coming out</i>

14:35.675 --> 14:37.375
<i>  which we're very excited</i>
<i>  about.</i>

14:37.377 --> 14:39.110
<i>  This is his first</i>
<i>  case back in person.</i>

14:39.846 --> 14:41.179
[Chip] This is insane.

14:48.321 --> 14:49.554
[Amy] All right.

14:51.524 --> 14:54.092
-[Chip] Like immediately
nauseated.
-[Amy] Mmm-hmm.

14:56.329 --> 14:57.762
It's getting close.

14:58.899 --> 15:00.732
Energies are like...

15:00.734 --> 15:02.166
[Amy] Mmm-hmm.

15:04.170 --> 15:05.436
[Chip] It's...

15:08.975 --> 15:11.910
It's fear, it's anger,

15:12.779 --> 15:14.846
it's hopeless. There's no...

15:17.350 --> 15:19.083
There's no turning back,
there's no escape.

15:19.085 --> 15:20.952
-Mmm-hmm.
-I'm here.

15:22.022 --> 15:25.056
-Okay.
-And the angering thing

15:25.058 --> 15:28.559
is a lot of them
haven't left.

15:28.561 --> 15:31.029
-[Amy] Okay.
-There are a lot of them.

15:34.067 --> 15:36.701
This place is massive.

15:36.703 --> 15:38.770
-[Amy] Yeah.
-I mean, that is one

15:38.772 --> 15:40.371
of the reasons why
we thought it

15:40.373 --> 15:42.106
was very important to get you

15:42.108 --> 15:44.242
in this space with us
because it is that big.

15:44.244 --> 15:45.510
[Amy] Mmm-hmm.

15:55.488 --> 15:56.821
[Chip] Where are the nurses?

15:56.823 --> 15:58.656
-[Amy] They're up one floor.
-[Adam] Up.

15:58.658 --> 16:00.024
[Chip] Let's go. Show me.

16:01.795 --> 16:03.061
[Chip laughs]

16:07.500 --> 16:09.167
They walk the halls.

16:15.875 --> 16:18.142
-There's a lot of death here.
-Mmm-hmm.

16:18.144 --> 16:20.845
There's a lot of death there.

16:23.883 --> 16:26.351
We got everything
going on in this space.

16:43.003 --> 16:44.402
Was there a hanging here?

16:45.872 --> 16:47.305
Yes.

16:47.307 --> 16:49.040
There's a particular room

16:49.042 --> 16:51.209
where a nurse hung herself
with a sheet

16:51.211 --> 16:53.044
and that was
that room right there.

16:54.748 --> 16:56.748
There's a woman,
I hear her saying,

16:58.618 --> 17:01.486
"We've turned into them."

17:04.190 --> 17:05.890
-[Amy] Okay.
-Oh, okay.

17:05.892 --> 17:07.759
-Yeah. I get that.
-[Adam] Yeah.

17:07.761 --> 17:11.095
We've turned into them.
That... With that, it's like,

17:11.097 --> 17:12.630
"Uh-uh, no."

17:17.003 --> 17:20.204
-But you had staff die.
-[Amy] Mmm-hmm.

17:20.206 --> 17:22.407
-[Chip] Some by their own
hand.
-[Amy] Mmm-hmm.

17:22.409 --> 17:25.243
[Chip] Some of them just
want the [bleep] out of here.

17:27.480 --> 17:28.780
Who's in the basement?

17:29.983 --> 17:31.649
It's where we wanted
to take you next.

17:34.254 --> 17:36.454
Oh [bleep] no.

17:41.961 --> 17:45.863
You got some angry
[bleep] people down here.

17:45.865 --> 17:48.032
-[Amy] Mmm-hmm.
-Mmm-hmm.

17:48.034 --> 17:51.469
-Some angry [bleep] people.
-[Amy] Mmm-hmm.

17:54.007 --> 17:57.008
[ominous music playing]

18:01.314 --> 18:02.914
[Adam] Watch your step,
guys, here.

18:09.122 --> 18:10.855
[Amy] They opened that hole.

18:14.227 --> 18:16.994
[Chip] This is, kind of,
where they stashed people.

18:16.996 --> 18:18.429
It's, kind of,
like cold storage.

18:18.431 --> 18:20.665
[Amy] Mmm-hmm. Okay. Okay.

18:20.667 --> 18:23.501
[Chip] They're just
stashing dead people

18:23.503 --> 18:25.303
so they can bury them
when the ground thawed.

18:25.305 --> 18:27.171
-I mean...
-[Amy] Mmm-hmm.

18:27.173 --> 18:29.040
-Mmm-hmm.
-And the spirits are very...

18:29.042 --> 18:31.809
100% like, "We're here.

18:31.811 --> 18:33.611
-We want the [bleep] out."
-[Amy] Okay.

18:33.613 --> 18:35.947
[Adam] Okay. There's one
more place over here

18:35.949 --> 18:38.082
-before we head down. Okay.
-[Amy] Yeah.

18:41.254 --> 18:43.955
[Chip] There's just something
creepy as [bleep]
down this way.

18:43.957 --> 18:45.957
-[Amy] Okay.
-[Adam] Okay.

18:45.959 --> 18:47.225
[Chip] Oh.

18:48.194 --> 18:49.727
[Amy] Did you guys see that?

18:52.298 --> 18:54.065
-[Adam] Oh.
-[Amy] What's happening?

18:54.067 --> 18:55.366
You guys...

18:58.638 --> 19:00.138
I told you.

19:01.541 --> 19:03.174
[Adam] I'm sorry.
What's happening?

19:03.176 --> 19:05.443
-[Chip] Uh-uh. No.
-[Amy] Let's go past this.

19:05.445 --> 19:08.546
[Chip] Uh, yeah, quickly.

19:08.548 --> 19:11.215
-[Adam] What in the hell?
-[Chip] You're making me grab
for my holy water.

19:11.217 --> 19:13.251
-Is this the way out?
-[Adam] Yeah.

19:17.223 --> 19:19.090
[Chip] Some of them still
gather in this space.

19:19.092 --> 19:20.992
[Amy] Oh, really?

19:20.994 --> 19:22.527
Scratching.

19:27.634 --> 19:30.368
I was standing here and I got
scratched on the back.

19:30.370 --> 19:32.403
Three scratches enough,

19:32.405 --> 19:34.071
they were red,
the bumps were raised up.

19:34.073 --> 19:35.873
Something really
had it out for you.

19:35.875 --> 19:36.908
Yeah.

19:38.244 --> 19:40.077
And I just heard
in my head, "I'll kill you,

19:40.079 --> 19:42.513
-you son of a [bleep]."
-[Amy] Mmm-hmm.

19:42.515 --> 19:45.249
-[Chip] That could
have been residual.
-Mmm-hmm.

19:50.690 --> 19:52.723
The main thing I'm picking up
so far in this space

19:52.725 --> 19:55.293
is you got a boatload
of people that are,

19:55.295 --> 19:57.428
kind of, here
and don't know what to do.

19:59.098 --> 20:01.032
There's nothing like doing
a walk through with Chip

20:01.034 --> 20:03.067
and having
him be in the moment,

20:03.069 --> 20:05.002
and present, and with us,

20:05.004 --> 20:06.704
<i>  and feeding off our energy,</i>
<i>  and reading the space.</i>

20:06.706 --> 20:09.507
And, you know, he said
some really interesting

20:09.509 --> 20:11.275
and amazing things
during the walk through

20:11.277 --> 20:12.610
<i>  that really got us thinking.</i>

20:12.612 --> 20:14.912
<i>  Like, at first, we were</i>
<i>  looking for one entity</i>

20:14.914 --> 20:16.647
<i>  from the morgue</i>
<i>  but now it's obvious</i>

20:16.649 --> 20:18.516
<i>  that there seems</i>
<i>  to be a lot of spirits here</i>

20:18.518 --> 20:20.384
<i>  that were responsible</i>
<i>  for the activity.</i>

20:20.386 --> 20:22.420
<i>  But we don't understand</i>
<i>  why the sudden shift</i>

20:22.422 --> 20:24.488
<i>  in their demeanor,</i>
<i>  like, do they need help,</i>

20:24.490 --> 20:26.857
<i>  are they stuck?</i>
<i>  And these are the questions</i>

20:26.859 --> 20:29.227
<i>  we have to get answered.</i>

20:29.229 --> 20:30.828
<i>  That's why we're calling</i>
<i>  in our friend</i>

20:30.830 --> 20:32.530
<i>  and fellow investigator,</i>
<i>  John Tenney.</i>

20:32.532 --> 20:34.198
<i>  With his guidance,</i>
<i>  we're gonna attempt</i>

20:34.200 --> 20:36.167
<i>  something we've</i>
<i>  never tried before.</i>

20:36.169 --> 20:41.239
Obviously, I've seen people
do spirit box sessions.

20:41.241 --> 20:44.375
And so I was thinking
about I've never seen anyone

20:44.377 --> 20:46.577
actually do a séance

20:46.579 --> 20:49.380
with someone who's doing
a spirit box session.

20:50.350 --> 20:52.450
Sitting together,
holding hands

20:52.452 --> 20:55.586
while one person
is using the spirit box,

20:55.588 --> 20:59.991
and since we're
all connected, speaking to...

20:59.993 --> 21:02.827
Directly to the person
who's using the spirit box.

21:02.829 --> 21:03.894
[Amy and Adam] Mmm-hmm.

21:03.896 --> 21:06.631
I think that a great spot

21:06.633 --> 21:08.232
for that would be
the nurses' wing

21:08.234 --> 21:10.601
because that's where the Chip
picked up so much earlier.

21:10.603 --> 21:13.004
-Mmm-hmm. Yeah. Let's do it.
-[Amy] Let's go try it.

21:13.006 --> 21:14.672
-I'm all for it.
-[Amy] Okay.

21:14.674 --> 21:16.474
-You guys ready?
-[Adam] Yes.

21:27.287 --> 21:30.288
[ominous music playing]

21:32.992 --> 21:36.027
Those that are non-living
in this space with us,

21:38.865 --> 21:41.932
we would like for you
to freely communicate with us

21:41.934 --> 21:45.670
by using the device
that our friend Amy

21:45.672 --> 21:47.038
is listening to.

21:49.275 --> 21:51.142
All four of us are open

21:51.144 --> 21:53.411
-and available
for communication.
-Message...

21:55.581 --> 21:56.781
for you.

22:01.354 --> 22:03.888
[Adam] We're all here,
ready to listen.

22:03.890 --> 22:05.289
Quiet.

22:06.359 --> 22:08.326
We're actually trying to help.

22:08.328 --> 22:09.360
Finish.

22:10.563 --> 22:12.029
You sound angry.

22:13.232 --> 22:14.532
Are you angry?

22:18.237 --> 22:23.541
There's a crying person saying
"so crazy" or "not crazy."

22:23.543 --> 22:25.409
It was like a crying female.

22:25.411 --> 22:29.080
Please, I've got
to get out of here.

22:30.350 --> 22:31.515
Hmm.

22:35.655 --> 22:37.021
[John] Is someone
telling you...

22:37.023 --> 22:38.255
Mom.

22:43.496 --> 22:44.729
Help me.

22:48.668 --> 22:50.968
[ominous music playing]

22:54.107 --> 22:59.143
How many of you are here
that need assistance?

23:00.279 --> 23:01.379
[Amy] Eighty.

23:03.282 --> 23:04.615
Yeah.

23:04.617 --> 23:07.651
Okay. Well,
where do we start?

23:07.653 --> 23:08.986
I [bleep].

23:09.956 --> 23:11.455
Look out.

23:13.159 --> 23:14.825
Seems like somebody else
is coming, like...

23:14.827 --> 23:16.594
[John] Yeah, there's not.
That's not the same...

23:16.596 --> 23:18.329
-[Adam] Yeah.
-[Amy] Stop it.

23:18.331 --> 23:20.097
You're not the same person
that you were before.

23:20.099 --> 23:22.466
-Who are you now?
-Act proper.

23:23.603 --> 23:25.202
Who are you?

23:26.939 --> 23:28.272
[John] Look at
how her face changed.

23:28.274 --> 23:29.774
-[Chip] Mmm-hmm.
-I'm dead.

23:29.776 --> 23:31.942
-[John] We know you're dead.
-We know you're dead

23:31.944 --> 23:34.378
and we don't fault you

23:34.380 --> 23:36.714
on the way that you died
or how you died.

23:38.017 --> 23:40.618
Whether it was by your
own hand or by somebody else.

23:40.620 --> 23:41.652
Wow.

23:42.822 --> 23:44.422
[John] But you don't... You.

23:44.424 --> 23:46.190
Somebody's touching
my right arm.

23:46.192 --> 23:49.860
You don't have authority
over any other spirits

23:49.862 --> 23:51.462
or people that are here.

23:51.464 --> 23:53.364
And you do not control us.

23:53.366 --> 23:56.367
We're in control
of this situation right now.

23:58.171 --> 23:59.537
No.

24:03.676 --> 24:05.443
[Adam] Those others
that are here that need help

24:05.445 --> 24:08.546
do not let this person
bully you into silence.

24:08.548 --> 24:10.915
-Leave.
-No.

24:12.218 --> 24:13.851
[Adam] We're definitely
not gonna be leaving

24:13.853 --> 24:16.020
-any time soon.
-Stop it.

24:16.022 --> 24:17.455
[Chip] No.

24:17.457 --> 24:19.723
You stop it.

24:22.361 --> 24:23.861
This isn't fun.

24:23.863 --> 24:25.196
Just know that...

24:26.899 --> 24:29.233
you can think
that you're in control

24:29.235 --> 24:33.237
but you don't have
to be in control anymore.

24:33.239 --> 24:35.506
You can let that part go.

24:38.945 --> 24:41.512
You don't have
to be in-charge anymore.

24:41.514 --> 24:42.880
[Amy] Stop it.

24:42.882 --> 24:44.482
[John] It's not
your job anymore.

24:44.484 --> 24:46.383
[Chip] It's not your job.

24:46.385 --> 24:48.252
[Adam] Yeah.
You don't have to work.

24:48.254 --> 24:50.387
-You don't have a job anymore.
-All of you.

24:50.389 --> 24:51.889
[Adam] You don't have purpose.

24:51.891 --> 24:53.757
-[Amy] Don't.
-[Chip] Yes.

24:53.759 --> 24:56.026
-You can go.
-[Chip] Go.

24:56.028 --> 24:57.728
I don't think so.

24:57.730 --> 25:00.030
-[John] Okay. Stubborn.
-[Adam] Yeah,
it's not gonna...

25:00.032 --> 25:01.432
Okay. Well, then...

25:04.737 --> 25:07.605
the other 80 people
that are in this building,

25:07.607 --> 25:09.440
I know you can hear me.

25:09.442 --> 25:10.908
This person that's talking...

25:10.910 --> 25:12.776
That was talking
is not in charge.

25:14.180 --> 25:15.412
That's enough.

25:17.083 --> 25:18.415
Wow.

25:19.719 --> 25:25.022
-I don't...
-I'm represented around here.

25:26.125 --> 25:27.791
-[Chip] Wow.
-[Adam] Yeah, it's like...

25:27.793 --> 25:30.361
I don't want her to be in this
personality for too much
longer.

25:30.363 --> 25:31.929
[Adam] Yeah, I know.
I think she... I think...

25:31.931 --> 25:33.030
Damn.

25:34.166 --> 25:36.634
-[Chip] She said damn?
-Mmm-hmm.

25:36.636 --> 25:38.469
I mean, I don't know
what else we're gonna get
from this person.

25:38.471 --> 25:40.604
[John] I don't know either.
All right. Let her out.

25:44.110 --> 25:45.876
-All right.
-Take a minute.
Just take a minute.

25:45.878 --> 25:47.311
[John]
Take a minute and unwind.

25:51.918 --> 25:54.218
[Adam] So, how did you feel
during that?

25:54.220 --> 25:56.687
It was weird. The beginning
was someone differ...

25:56.689 --> 25:59.323
The beginning was like
a female

25:59.325 --> 26:02.259
who sounded really sad
and I got a little teary-eyed.

26:02.261 --> 26:04.094
And then the second part,

26:04.096 --> 26:07.197
I couldn't even make out
that weird voice.

26:07.199 --> 26:09.366
-So, I don't know.
-[Adam] Basically...

26:09.368 --> 26:11.936
So, basically
this idea worked.

26:11.938 --> 26:15.639
It really seemed like
the entities that are here...

26:15.641 --> 26:18.208
-Uh-huh.
-Started to recognize

26:18.210 --> 26:20.277
-that they had a voice.
-Mmm-hmm.

26:20.279 --> 26:23.180
-[Chip] Absolutely.
-And an authoritarian
stepped in

26:23.182 --> 26:26.016
and said, "This is not
happening on my watch."

26:26.018 --> 26:28.452
-Yeah, okay.
-[Adam] Yeah.
It was very much that.

26:28.454 --> 26:31.021
I think we have a lot
to think about and discuss.

26:31.023 --> 26:33.691
But the facts
of the spirit box session

26:33.693 --> 26:36.694
that we just did are...
There are clearly

26:36.696 --> 26:38.662
a number of souls
and people here

26:38.664 --> 26:40.864
that don't want
to be here and wanna leave.

26:40.866 --> 26:43.701
There's clearly
other entities in the building

26:43.703 --> 26:46.604
who are still "in charge."

26:46.606 --> 26:48.238
And that's the facts
from just...

26:48.240 --> 26:49.740
Without theorizing
and speculating.

26:49.742 --> 26:51.075
-Right.
-[Amy] Okay.

26:51.077 --> 26:53.911
I think we should
do the two wings.

26:53.913 --> 26:55.813
Just separate
and we can sit and listen,

26:55.815 --> 26:58.816
-see if, you know,
things happen.
-[Amy] Mmm-hmm.

26:58.818 --> 27:01.385
And then let's alert
each other if we start

27:01.387 --> 27:04.555
hearing weird knocks,
because it happened yesterday.

27:08.728 --> 27:12.563
I'm gonna set up
the EMF tripwire.

27:12.565 --> 27:13.630
[Adam] Okay.

27:19.438 --> 27:21.972
My idea is that we're gonna do
EVP old school

27:21.974 --> 27:24.308
with a actual tape recorder.

27:30.182 --> 27:31.649
Dr. Tenney is in.

27:33.352 --> 27:35.552
So, if someone's
down here with us,

27:36.589 --> 27:38.956
could you hear
that person talking to us

27:38.958 --> 27:40.491
in the nurses' wing?

27:44.397 --> 27:46.563
If there's anyone here

27:46.565 --> 27:50.134
and you wanna speak to us,
now is the time to do that.

27:51.103 --> 27:53.303
You can tell us
anything about yourself.

27:53.305 --> 27:55.606
We're not here to judge you.

27:55.608 --> 27:58.008
We just wanna
communicate with you.

28:00.446 --> 28:04.415
We were trying to help anyone

28:04.417 --> 28:06.817
who no longer
wanted to be here.

28:08.487 --> 28:10.554
But somebody stepped in

28:11.424 --> 28:14.324
and took over our discussion.

28:17.296 --> 28:19.797
<i> [John] If there's anyone here,</i>

28:19.799 --> 28:22.866
<i>  and you want to speak to us,</i>
<i>  now is the time to do that.</i>

28:24.503 --> 28:26.136
<i>  -You can tell</i>
<i>  us anything about...</i>
<i>  - [scratching sound]</i>

28:27.273 --> 28:28.739
<i>  We're not here</i>
<i>  to judge you...</i>

28:28.741 --> 28:30.708
What the hell happened?

28:32.278 --> 28:34.344
What the hell happened?

28:35.781 --> 28:37.381
-Go back.
-[John] That's weird.

28:37.383 --> 28:39.817
That... It should not
have happened.

28:42.521 --> 28:44.555
<i> -[John] You can tell us</i>
<i>  anything about...</i>
<i>  - [scratching sound]</i>

28:44.557 --> 28:46.990
What? What?

28:46.992 --> 28:48.425
That's very weird.

28:51.997 --> 28:54.998
[ominous music playing]

28:57.970 --> 29:01.138
-That's blip... Glitch.
-Yeah, that's [bleep] up.

29:01.140 --> 29:03.173
You can say anything
you want to say

29:03.175 --> 29:05.275
and it blows
the whole tape out?

29:05.277 --> 29:07.211
Try it again.

29:09.849 --> 29:11.181
[Chip]
Are you recording again?

29:11.183 --> 29:12.316
Recording now.

29:13.152 --> 29:15.619
So if you just heard,

29:15.621 --> 29:17.554
we were playing back

29:17.556 --> 29:19.990
us talking and you talking,

29:19.992 --> 29:21.792
you trying to communicate.

29:22.962 --> 29:26.363
We want you to speak,
we want to hear your story.

29:27.399 --> 29:29.299
So we're, uh...

29:30.636 --> 29:35.005
I just saw a really fast black
shadow in front of that door.

29:35.975 --> 29:38.709
It was, like, fast.

29:41.313 --> 29:43.947
Who's down there?
Can you please come
closer to us?

29:46.018 --> 29:48.485
Come closer,
those lights might light up

29:48.487 --> 29:50.420
when you come near us.
But that's okay.

29:50.422 --> 29:54.224
It's just so we know
that you're approaching.

29:58.831 --> 29:59.930
<i> [Chip] Are you</i>
<i>  recording again?</i>

29:59.932 --> 30:01.298
<i> [John] Recording now.</i>

30:02.501 --> 30:03.967
<i>  -So if you just heard...</i>
<i>  - [scratching sound]</i>

30:03.969 --> 30:05.335
[Chip] Again.

30:05.337 --> 30:09.006
<i> [John] ...we were playing</i>
<i>  back us talking and you...</i>

30:09.008 --> 30:12.009
That's just not
even close to right.

30:12.011 --> 30:14.978
I know. It's like something
is reaching into the tape.

30:14.980 --> 30:16.647
You know what I mean?

30:16.649 --> 30:18.649
-Like it's almost like...
-[Chip] Manipulating it.

30:18.651 --> 30:20.617
...it's trying to press one
of the buttons to turn it off.

30:20.619 --> 30:21.718
[Chip] Yeah.

30:23.322 --> 30:26.590
Does anyone know
who the person was?

30:26.592 --> 30:28.959
-Oh, my God.
-What?

30:28.961 --> 30:32.329
I just saw
a shadow right here.

30:33.199 --> 30:34.498
-Really?
-Yeah.

30:34.500 --> 30:35.999
Oh, I was looking
all the way down at the end.

30:36.001 --> 30:37.901
[Adam] Right. No, like a real

30:37.903 --> 30:40.704
honest to Jesus Lord God

30:40.706 --> 30:43.073
tall like shadow,
it went poof.

30:43.075 --> 30:44.441
[Amy] I'm getting
the creepies.

30:45.110 --> 30:47.711
You got our attention.

30:47.713 --> 30:50.347
Is there anything else
that you can say to us

30:50.349 --> 30:52.716
with your voice or somehow

30:52.718 --> 30:55.586
communicate with us
so we can hear you more?

30:58.090 --> 31:00.958
Can you try and press
the buttons on...

31:02.394 --> 31:04.361
Can you try
and press the buttons on

31:04.363 --> 31:05.729
the cassette recorder?

31:09.068 --> 31:10.834
[Adam] Do us a favor.

31:10.836 --> 31:13.103
Our two friends are down
at the end of that hallway.

31:15.608 --> 31:19.710
Can you do something to them
to get their attention?

31:19.712 --> 31:23.013
Is it me or did it
just get really hot?

31:23.015 --> 31:25.215
[John] I did feel
a temperature shift.

31:28.020 --> 31:29.620
<i> [Chip] You got our attention.</i>

31:30.689 --> 31:33.390
<i>  Is there anything else</i>
<i>  that you can say to us</i>

31:33.392 --> 31:35.959
<i>  with your voice or somehow</i>

31:35.961 --> 31:38.528
<i>  communicate with us</i>
<i>  so we can hear you more?</i>

31:39.498 --> 31:40.964
<i>  -Can you try...</i>
<i>  - [scratching sound]</i>

31:40.966 --> 31:42.299
[gasps]

31:43.736 --> 31:46.937
That is [bleep] crazy.

31:46.939 --> 31:48.739
I wonder if it's darting
around up here.

31:48.741 --> 31:51.108
I wonder if they saw a shadow.

31:51.110 --> 31:53.110
-I don't know.
-Let's go ask
if they've seen any shadows

31:53.112 --> 31:55.345
because I wonder
if it's moving around.

31:55.347 --> 31:57.481
I'm telling you right now,

31:57.483 --> 32:01.285
if you watch the footage back
of me asking the question,

32:01.287 --> 32:03.287
I felt it happen that time.

32:04.556 --> 32:08.225
That's why I started to ask it
and stopped and kept going.

32:08.227 --> 32:11.461
Can you try
and press the buttons on?

32:12.965 --> 32:15.032
Can you try
and press the buttons on

32:15.034 --> 32:16.566
the cassette recorder?

32:16.568 --> 32:18.535
I felt the interaction
happening.

32:18.537 --> 32:22.539
-That's absolutely crazy.
-[Amy] How's it going?

32:22.541 --> 32:24.408
-[Chip] We got some stuff.
-[Amy] You did?

32:24.410 --> 32:26.109
Something in here.

32:26.111 --> 32:28.412
So three for three.

32:29.648 --> 32:31.682
-[Amy] Okay.
-There's three different
little EVP sessions.

32:31.684 --> 32:32.816
-[Amy] Okay.
-[Adam] Okay.

32:34.820 --> 32:36.620
[John]
<i>  Can you tell us your name?</i>

32:38.223 --> 32:40.023
<i>  -You can tell us</i>
<i>  anything about...</i>
<i>  - [scratching sound]</i>

32:41.727 --> 32:42.826
<i>  ...communicate with you.</i>

32:42.828 --> 32:43.994
-[Amy] That's weird.
-You can tell us

32:43.996 --> 32:45.829
anything you want.
[makes sound]

32:45.831 --> 32:47.864
-No. Okay.
-Beginning
of the second session.

32:48.600 --> 32:49.766
<i> [John] Recording now.</i>

32:50.970 --> 32:52.703
<i>  -So you just heard...</i>
<i>  - [scratching sound]</i>

32:52.705 --> 32:54.371
-Did it again.
-Yes.

32:54.373 --> 32:56.039
-It was like woop.
-Right now.

32:56.041 --> 32:57.441
[John] ...and you talking.

32:57.443 --> 32:59.676
-[Chip] No.
-Third session.

33:00.746 --> 33:02.679
-[John] Can you turn...
-[both] Oh.

33:02.681 --> 33:04.414
It does not like you.

33:04.416 --> 33:06.583
It doesn't wanna be recorded.

33:06.585 --> 33:08.752
Thank you guys
for all your help tonight.

33:10.356 --> 33:12.789
<i> [Amy] As always, we have</i>
<i>  our work cut out for us.</i>

33:12.791 --> 33:14.624
<i>  This is a mental</i>
<i>  health facility.</i>

33:14.626 --> 33:16.593
<i>  And these spirits might</i>
<i>  have a different outlook</i>

33:16.595 --> 33:18.428
<i>  than we're used to.</i>

33:18.430 --> 33:20.030
<i>  Tomorrow, I'm calling</i>
<i>  in my friend Sarah,</i>

33:20.032 --> 33:21.898
<i>  a mental health professional,</i>

33:21.900 --> 33:24.334
<i>  who might bring a better</i>
<i>  approach to the table.</i>

33:28.540 --> 33:30.173
-[Amy] Welcome.
-[Sarah] Thank you.

33:30.175 --> 33:32.476
[Amy] All right.
What we're dealing with here

33:32.478 --> 33:33.944
was a psychiatric facility.

33:33.946 --> 33:36.279
I've investigated with you
many times over the years.

33:36.281 --> 33:38.982
It's nice that you also have
a paranormal background, too.

33:38.984 --> 33:42.019
As we're approaching
entities here,

33:42.021 --> 33:44.654
what would you think
is like a good way

33:44.656 --> 33:46.690
to kind of engage them?

33:46.692 --> 33:49.559
Honestly, the way
that I engage anybody,

33:49.561 --> 33:51.928
um, when I do the work in, uh,

33:51.930 --> 33:53.363
my own profession,

33:53.365 --> 33:55.899
you should allow them

33:55.901 --> 33:57.601
to tell you what they need,

33:57.603 --> 34:00.103
like, do not get
too wrapped up

34:00.105 --> 34:02.606
in some kind of
structured interview,

34:02.608 --> 34:04.541
which I know is kind
of flying in the face

34:04.543 --> 34:06.376
of what you're trying to do,
which is gather information.

34:06.378 --> 34:08.545
But honestly,
what most people want

34:08.547 --> 34:10.180
is just to tell their story.

34:10.182 --> 34:12.549
And they want to leave
a session feeling heard.

34:12.551 --> 34:14.818
Now, that I'm hearing
what she's saying,

34:15.754 --> 34:18.021
the fact that you
and I and Chip sat...

34:18.023 --> 34:20.257
We sat with Amy in a circle

34:20.259 --> 34:24.061
and held hands and it sort
of amplified the energy

34:24.063 --> 34:26.930
of the four of us trying
to get information, right?

34:26.932 --> 34:29.399
And we felt like
there were many people there

34:29.401 --> 34:31.168
in that space
that wanted help,

34:31.170 --> 34:33.003
that didn't understand
why they were there still.

34:33.005 --> 34:35.772
And then all of a sudden,
it flipped, right?

34:35.774 --> 34:38.375
And whoever we were
talking to was like,

34:38.377 --> 34:40.544
"Stop what you're doing.
This is not okay.

34:40.546 --> 34:42.245
Whatever you're doing
is not right." Right?

34:42.247 --> 34:44.614
But it makes sense
because you're saying

34:44.616 --> 34:46.950
just listening and hearing

34:46.952 --> 34:48.618
rather than interrogating,

34:48.620 --> 34:51.088
and we were very much
interrogating.

34:51.090 --> 34:53.090
So what if
this person was like,

34:53.092 --> 34:54.624
"You're not doing it right."

34:54.626 --> 34:56.393
We are challenging

34:56.395 --> 34:58.495
-the way that this
place operates.
-Yeah.

34:58.497 --> 35:00.564
And the person
who actually knows

35:00.566 --> 35:02.132
what's best for this place

35:02.134 --> 35:04.401
is like you are not
doing this right.

35:04.403 --> 35:06.269
Well, also, not to mention,
that's probably how

35:06.271 --> 35:07.938
everyone's been
approaching this

35:07.940 --> 35:09.272
as they've been investigating.

35:09.274 --> 35:10.841
Like, that is just what we do
as investigators.

35:10.843 --> 35:13.977
And so that could
absolutely be serving

35:13.979 --> 35:15.745
as a hindrance to us here.

35:15.747 --> 35:17.581
I think if we had
a couple ideas

35:17.583 --> 35:19.716
-for experiments we could try.
-Sure.

35:19.718 --> 35:21.885
It's like doing
the spirit box, right?

35:21.887 --> 35:23.553
And one of us listen to it.

35:23.555 --> 35:26.289
And then you conduct yourself

35:26.291 --> 35:27.757
in a manner that you would

35:27.759 --> 35:29.326
for a normal interaction
with a patient.

35:29.328 --> 35:31.328
-[Sarah] Yup.
Group therapy
-was a big thing here.

35:31.330 --> 35:33.730
And we can sit in our circle
like we normally do.

35:33.732 --> 35:35.732
We can start that way,
if it's not working, split up.

35:35.734 --> 35:36.766
Yeah. Let's do that.

35:36.768 --> 35:39.836
[tense music playing]

35:44.910 --> 35:46.443
Okey-dokey.

35:50.549 --> 35:53.717
All right. So why don't you
get set up there, Mr. Berry?

35:55.487 --> 35:58.588
Okay. I will let you
guys know when I'm set.

36:03.162 --> 36:05.262
-I'm good.
-Okay, so what do we do?

36:05.264 --> 36:08.365
Well, if we're
in a little group.

36:08.367 --> 36:10.133
-What did he say?
-[John] He said,
"I don't know."

36:10.135 --> 36:13.403
-You asked, what do we do.
-[bleep] Okay. All right.

36:13.405 --> 36:15.872
[Sarah] I'm going to show you
how you can anytime...

36:15.874 --> 36:18.675
-You.
-...be able to self
soothe yourself

36:18.677 --> 36:20.377
through a distraction method.

36:20.379 --> 36:22.412
Specifically,
your five senses.

36:22.414 --> 36:25.315
Yes, relax.

36:25.317 --> 36:27.784
Yeah. And it definitely
helps you relax.

36:27.786 --> 36:29.686
That's the entire point.

36:29.688 --> 36:31.521
Confused.

36:31.523 --> 36:33.857
[Amy] Yeah,
it's a little confusing.

36:33.859 --> 36:35.458
You don't have to be confused.

36:35.460 --> 36:36.960
We're just talking
about relaxing.

36:37.963 --> 36:39.362
-We're just talking about...
-Yes.

36:39.364 --> 36:41.064
Taking about
things that calm us.

36:41.066 --> 36:42.966
-[Amy] What makes you...
-Yellow.

36:42.968 --> 36:44.734
[Amy] Yellow? Okay.
Like the color yellow?

36:44.736 --> 36:46.436
[Sarah] Color yellow. Yup.

36:46.438 --> 36:49.940
This is gonna sound weird,
but I feel like...

36:52.311 --> 36:56.546
Like I feel like I want
to crawl out of my skin,

36:56.548 --> 36:58.215
like, I want
to flip the table.

36:58.217 --> 37:00.050
That's what I feel like.
It's so...

37:00.052 --> 37:03.954
Like, I'm so just agitated.

37:03.956 --> 37:07.123
Ugh. Like ugh,
it's so weird, y'all.

37:12.231 --> 37:13.763
He's gonna have a panic
attack in a minute.

37:15.167 --> 37:17.701
-I mean that...
-It's okay to have feelings.

37:17.703 --> 37:19.369
Feelings are good to have.

37:23.108 --> 37:25.976
[Sarah] Yeah,
you are safe here.

37:25.978 --> 37:27.711
-Yeah. You're definitely safe.
-You can also express it

37:27.713 --> 37:29.246
if you want to. We're here.

37:31.083 --> 37:33.617
-I... Just stop. I'm sorry.
-Yup.

37:33.619 --> 37:35.385
I have to stop.

37:35.387 --> 37:37.754
I can't sit there anymore.
It stopped talking.

37:37.756 --> 37:39.456
It stopped talking.
And all I can...

37:39.458 --> 37:41.591
All... Literally,
all I could feel

37:41.593 --> 37:46.196
was like, it was like
I wanted... I've never...

37:46.198 --> 37:47.764
Because, you know,
sometimes you feel

37:47.766 --> 37:48.898
-like what they feel.
-[Amy] Mmm-hmm.

37:48.900 --> 37:50.233
I wanted to like...

37:50.235 --> 37:52.202
I wanted to like push you.

37:52.204 --> 37:54.704
I wanted to pull...
Like flip the table.

37:54.706 --> 37:57.240
I wanted to like scream.

37:57.242 --> 37:59.142
I wanted to just,
like, sit here.

37:59.144 --> 38:01.611
I didn't want to say anything.
I wanted to be left alone.

38:01.613 --> 38:03.613
-This is a hurt, hurt soul...
-[Amy] Mmm-hmm.

38:03.615 --> 38:05.749
-...that is lashing out.
-[Amy] Mmm-hmm.

38:05.751 --> 38:07.884
I think it's a collaborative

38:07.886 --> 38:10.253
group of people saying like,

38:10.255 --> 38:12.689
"We're fine.
You don't need to do this."

38:12.691 --> 38:15.859
Yeah. Well, because who wants
to be a spectacle, right?

38:15.861 --> 38:17.627
Like who wants to just be
poked at and...

38:17.629 --> 38:19.262
Especially these people.
They already felt
like a spectacle.

38:19.264 --> 38:20.597
-They knew.
-[Sarah] Totally.

38:20.599 --> 38:23.266
How do we help them?
How do you help them?

38:23.268 --> 38:25.402
Is acknowledging
that we understand

38:25.404 --> 38:27.671
where they're coming from now
a way of...

38:27.673 --> 38:29.706
-[Sarah] That's a start. Yes.
-...starting to help?

38:29.708 --> 38:31.875
I wonder if it
just becomes this like

38:31.877 --> 38:34.444
educational moment
for investigators,

38:34.446 --> 38:36.212
like, if investigators
come in here,

38:36.214 --> 38:39.215
they need to be like
so respectful

38:39.217 --> 38:42.285
and cognizant
of who they're talking to.

38:42.287 --> 38:44.087
[Adam] That's it.
It's the respect.

38:44.089 --> 38:47.123
Okay, I think we're good.
Let's head upstairs.

38:47.125 --> 38:48.958
Thank you so much
for your help, you guys.

38:48.960 --> 38:52.228
That was huge.
But we have a lot
to fill Craig in on.

38:53.732 --> 38:54.898
Okay.

38:58.003 --> 38:59.602
<i> [Amy] While we're still unsure</i>

38:59.604 --> 39:01.171
<i>  if what was released</i>
<i>  from the morgue</i>

39:01.173 --> 39:02.639
<i>  was a singular entity</i>

39:02.641 --> 39:03.940
<i>  or more of an energy</i>

39:03.942 --> 39:05.642
<i>  that roused these</i>
<i>  spirits here,</i>

39:05.644 --> 39:07.344
<i>  there is one thing</i>
<i>  we're certain of,</i>

39:07.346 --> 39:09.012
<i>  this is not just a spectacle,</i>

39:09.014 --> 39:11.014
<i>  you are walking into a place</i>

39:11.016 --> 39:13.983
<i>  that was the last hope</i>
<i>  for a lot of people.</i>

39:13.985 --> 39:16.453
<i>  And many of them</i>
<i>  seem to still be here.</i>

39:16.455 --> 39:19.122
<i>  I think overall,</i>
<i>  we're just going to try</i>

39:19.124 --> 39:21.958
<i>  to compel him to change</i>
<i>  the investigative style</i>

39:21.960 --> 39:23.593
<i>  that people have</i>
<i>  as they come in here</i>

39:23.595 --> 39:25.061
<i>  to look for spirits.</i>

39:30.836 --> 39:34.871
This asylum was unlike
any other we've investigated.

39:34.873 --> 39:36.206
And that really comes down

39:36.208 --> 39:37.774
to the history
of the building.

39:37.776 --> 39:41.678
This place was not nearly
as like horrific

39:41.680 --> 39:44.214
as some of the other asylums
we've investigated

39:44.216 --> 39:46.616
that were shut down
because of awful conditions.

39:46.618 --> 39:49.386
The treatment here
was very positive.

39:49.388 --> 39:50.987
That's why to us, it's like,

39:50.989 --> 39:53.790
it's so important
to humanize these folks

39:53.792 --> 39:57.494
and know who you're talking to
and their situation,

39:57.496 --> 39:59.696
it becomes a very
different invest...

39:59.698 --> 40:02.632
-It's no longer a thrill.
There are still patients here.
-Wow.

40:02.634 --> 40:05.969
And they are here
because they felt like

40:05.971 --> 40:07.670
this was the only place
that helped them.

40:07.672 --> 40:09.406
You know, it's interesting,

40:09.408 --> 40:11.307
because you called us here
because you were like,

40:11.309 --> 40:13.309
we broke down that wall
and something came out of it,

40:13.311 --> 40:15.178
you know?
Something might have.

40:15.180 --> 40:17.714
-Mmm-hmm.
-But it's not that bad
and negative.

40:17.716 --> 40:19.649
It could have been something
that was always here.

40:19.651 --> 40:21.418
And that would interact.

40:21.420 --> 40:25.155
That little space
was one of the only places

40:25.157 --> 40:27.791
in this building
that was fully enclosed.

40:27.793 --> 40:29.759
-Mmm-hmm.
-[Adam] Right? That someone,

40:29.761 --> 40:32.862
spirit could go there
and be alone

40:32.864 --> 40:35.532
-without being bothered
by anyone, right?
-True.

40:35.534 --> 40:37.267
So when you broke
down that wall,

40:38.236 --> 40:39.669
they have nowhere else to go.

40:39.671 --> 40:41.204
There's no other place
in this building

40:41.206 --> 40:43.339
-that is confined
and contained like that.
-Sure.

40:43.341 --> 40:46.976
-[Amy] There's little spirits
and energy all over this place
-Yeah.

40:46.978 --> 40:49.879
I think it's very important
to understand

40:49.881 --> 40:52.315
that what we accomplished

40:52.317 --> 40:55.285
on this case
is the groundwork,

40:55.287 --> 40:57.687
and I thought the best way
that we could investigate

40:57.689 --> 40:59.589
really was having the spirits

40:59.591 --> 41:01.991
or the entities lead
the investigation for us.

41:01.993 --> 41:04.327
It's almost a reversal.
It's like,

41:04.329 --> 41:05.929
what do you want to do?

41:05.931 --> 41:07.864
Yeah, you tell us.
We'll follow your lead.

41:07.866 --> 41:10.266
And then they get
to tell their story.

41:10.268 --> 41:12.836
We're very curious to see
what kind of responses you get

41:12.838 --> 41:14.971
when you change up
how you investigate here

41:14.973 --> 41:17.040
because like I said,
this is a place

41:17.042 --> 41:19.175
-that's completely different
from anywhere we've ever been.
-[Craig] Sure.

41:19.177 --> 41:21.077
And I think
a lot of people would be

41:21.079 --> 41:22.445
good to knowing the truth

41:22.447 --> 41:24.280
rather than all
the fake stories

41:24.282 --> 41:25.882
that you read online, so...

41:25.884 --> 41:27.917
-Oh, yeah. For sure.
-Awesome.

41:27.919 --> 41:29.853
Well, thank you so much.
It's been a pleasure.

41:29.855 --> 41:32.388
And I know we want to come
back at some point, so...

41:32.390 --> 41:34.157
Yeah, we definitely.
It'd be fun.

41:34.159 --> 41:36.292
-It'd be great. Thank you.
-[Amy] All right. Thanks.

41:37.262 --> 41:39.829
Adam and I really wanted
to impress upon Craig

41:39.831 --> 41:41.898
that this place
is so very special.

41:41.900 --> 41:43.466
<i>  And for so long,</i>

41:43.468 --> 41:45.602
<i>  this was a really</i>
<i>  positive place.</i>

41:45.604 --> 41:47.470
<i>  It was a place</i>
<i>  that made a difference</i>

41:47.472 --> 41:49.105
<i>  in a lot of people's lives.</i>

41:49.107 --> 41:51.107
<i>  And so I think</i>
<i>  Craig was very receptive</i>

41:51.109 --> 41:54.077
<i>  to the idea</i>
<i>  of kind of changing</i>

41:54.079 --> 41:55.645
<i>  the way</i>
<i>  they investigate here.</i>
