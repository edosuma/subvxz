21:38.864 --> 21:40.466
- You think?

21:40.534 --> 21:43.405
What's happening?
- The Four of Swords reversed

21:43.471 --> 21:44.875
is the opposite of healing.

21:44.942 --> 21:46.679
Your spell has made them
all really sick.

21:46.746 --> 21:49.083
- No, no, no.
These are company dancers,

21:49.150 --> 21:52.758
not our class!
This wasn't supposed to happen.

21:52.824 --> 21:56.733
It was supposed to be general
malaise to make them tired,

21:56.799 --> 21:58.502
not sick.

22:00.306 --> 22:02.744
[vomiting sounds]

22:05.283 --> 22:08.355
- Are you okay?
LOLA: [retches]

22:08.422 --> 22:10.994
[toilet flushes]

22:13.398 --> 22:15.570
Of all the spells...

22:15.637 --> 22:18.309
you gave her the one
that makes people barf?

22:18.375 --> 22:20.814
[stomach rumbles]
- If you were the one

22:20.880 --> 22:23.385
absorbing Cece, then you
wouldn't have been hit

22:23.452 --> 22:24.989
by the general malaise.

22:25.055 --> 22:27.393
That's all I'm sayin'.
- I already told you

22:27.460 --> 22:30.098
point taken--jeez!

22:31.502 --> 22:33.071
- [coughing, gagging]

22:33.138 --> 22:35.644
- So this definitely seals it.

22:35.710 --> 22:37.614
She's the Wise One,
all right.

22:37.681 --> 22:41.187
She super-charged the spell,
and it made everyone sick.

22:42.490 --> 22:45.797
A true Wizen
always chooses magic.

22:45.864 --> 22:47.767
- This is super powerful
for someone so new.

22:47.834 --> 22:49.838
[vomiting sounds in background]

22:49.905 --> 22:53.144
- [gagging]
- You okay?

22:57.153 --> 23:01.562
[overlapping gagging,
vomiting sounds]

23:02.998 --> 23:04.602
ARMANDO: Okay.

23:04.668 --> 23:05.971
We have an emergency.

23:06.038 --> 23:09.010
Almost everyone
in the corps is sick.

23:09.076 --> 23:11.047
Many of the first and second
division students

23:11.114 --> 23:12.350
who are also in this piece

23:12.416 --> 23:14.522
have also been hit
with this illness.

23:14.588 --> 23:18.996
It's completely unprecedented,
but we have no other choice.

23:19.063 --> 23:21.736
We have decided that you

23:21.803 --> 23:25.009
will be dancing on
the main stage tomorrow night

23:25.075 --> 23:28.081
in front of a full house.

23:28.148 --> 23:30.987
Never in the history
of the Garnier

23:31.054 --> 23:32.958
has a class
of third-year students

23:33.024 --> 23:36.031
danced in a professional show
on the Garnier stage.

23:36.097 --> 23:39.137
And certainly not with
virtually no rehearsals.

23:39.204 --> 23:41.007
And being that we need
to rehearse the piece,

23:41.074 --> 23:43.746
I will make my selections based
on what I've seen in class,

23:43.813 --> 23:46.652
in audition,
and tomorrow's performance.

23:46.719 --> 23:49.390
Then...I'm sorry.

23:49.457 --> 23:51.596
Some of you will be cut.

23:51.662 --> 23:54.100
So good luck to all of you.

23:54.167 --> 23:56.305
Thank you.
