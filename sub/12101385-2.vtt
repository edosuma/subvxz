WEBVTT

00:12.250 --> 00:14.166
Give it up
for Miss Ladyhawk herself!

00:15.750 --> 00:17.083
Why do they call you Ladyhawk?

00:17.166 --> 00:19.291
I made a shot
in a basketball game.

00:20.417 --> 00:23.417
If the police aren't gonna
fight to find Katie, we will.

00:23.709 --> 00:25.166
They want to add
a county detective

00:25.250 --> 00:26.208
to assist with the case.

00:26.291 --> 00:27.792
No, no, no, no. I don't need

00:27.875 --> 00:30.250
some county shithead
coming on my case.

00:32.083 --> 00:32.834
Hey dad.

00:32.917 --> 00:34.000
Did you talk to shit-for-brains?

00:34.291 --> 00:37.250
'Cause I'm paying for the wipes,
I'm paying for the formula,

00:37.458 --> 00:38.709
all for his son!

00:41.583 --> 00:42.583
What is she doing here?

00:42.667 --> 00:44.458
Don't worry
about what she's doing here.

00:44.542 --> 00:45.875
I don't ask about your life.

00:45.959 --> 00:48.000
He doesn't want anything
to do with you anymore.

00:49.625 --> 00:50.750
What's going on?

00:53.583 --> 00:54.583
Hey.

01:57.583 --> 01:58.875
Hey, Sarge.

02:05.583 --> 02:06.709
Mare.

02:09.125 --> 02:10.208
It's not pretty.

02:26.250 --> 02:28.000
Kenny McMenamin's daughter.

02:31.291 --> 02:32.333
Erin?

02:33.542 --> 02:35.500
A jogger came across it
this morning.

02:37.333 --> 02:40.208
Holbert was here first.

02:41.709 --> 02:43.917
Medic pronounced her at 7:14.

02:44.625 --> 02:46.375
We ran a preliminary search.

02:47.291 --> 02:49.125
Didn't turn up anything.

02:59.250 --> 03:01.083
She's been here a while.

03:02.250 --> 03:03.750
Jesus Christ.

03:20.500 --> 03:21.834
How close would someone
have been

03:21.917 --> 03:23.583
to cause that kind of damage?

03:24.959 --> 03:27.709
How close? I'd say...

03:29.625 --> 03:30.750
face to face.

03:33.291 --> 03:34.959
You notify the M.E.?

03:35.041 --> 03:36.458
Just waiting on you.

03:39.125 --> 03:41.959
I called the County Supervisor.

03:42.041 --> 03:45.709
They're sending one of their
detectives down to assist.

03:45.792 --> 03:49.000
Don't look at me like that.
I don't got a choice anymore.

03:50.709 --> 03:53.333
-We know who it is?
-His name's Colin Zabel.

03:53.417 --> 03:54.959
He's the one that solved
that cold case

03:55.041 --> 03:57.625
in Upper Darby last year.
Missing ten-year-old girl.

03:57.709 --> 04:00.250
He should be at the station
by this afternoon.

04:04.667 --> 04:07.750
Yeah. Mare Sheehan,
uh, down at Easttown.

04:07.834 --> 04:12.000
Got a 17-year-old female
out here in Sharp's Woods.

04:13.291 --> 04:14.417
Cause of death suspicious.

04:14.500 --> 04:17.166
Send out the on-call
M.E. tech right away.

04:17.250 --> 04:20.417
All right. Everybody,
put your gloves on.

04:20.500 --> 04:24.291
Do a grid search,
all the way out to Route 13.

04:24.375 --> 04:26.500
Mark anything that
seems out of place.

04:27.291 --> 04:30.083
Tag it so we can photograph it.

04:30.166 --> 04:32.208
All right, guys,
circle up. Let's go.

04:37.667 --> 04:39.625
So, have you talked to Corey?

04:39.709 --> 04:41.000
I haven't.

04:41.083 --> 04:45.667
But I want Jason Culver to
take me to the homecoming dance

04:45.750 --> 04:47.333
instead of Corey.

04:47.417 --> 04:48.834
What?
Well, Corey already asked you,

04:48.917 --> 04:51.208
and you already said yes,
so you're stuck with Corey,

04:51.291 --> 04:54.000
-and that's that.
- Whatever.

04:54.083 --> 04:55.583
Whatever?

04:55.667 --> 04:59.333
Oh, my goodness.
You're so bad, Moira Grace Ross.

05:04.041 --> 05:04.959
Hello?

05:05.041 --> 05:06.875
-Hey.
-Uh, hi.

05:06.959 --> 05:09.041
You didn't answer
when I called last night,

05:09.125 --> 05:11.208
so I assume he wasn't
too big a chump.

05:11.291 --> 05:12.625
Is John up yet?

05:12.709 --> 05:14.542
No. He's dead to the world.

05:14.625 --> 05:17.583
They must have had some fun
at Frank's last night.

05:17.667 --> 05:19.208
Wake him up for me, Lor.

05:20.667 --> 05:22.250
Erin was killed last night.

05:22.917 --> 05:24.041
What?

05:26.291 --> 05:28.291
Oh, my God. What happened?

05:28.375 --> 05:29.667
We don't know yet.

05:29.750 --> 05:32.625
Her body was found this morning
out at Creedham Creek.

05:32.709 --> 05:35.542
I'm on my way over
to Kenny's now to tell him.

05:35.625 --> 05:37.667
I want John and Billy
to meet me there.

05:37.750 --> 05:40.750
Probably good to have his
cousins there for him, you know?

05:40.834 --> 05:44.083
Yeah, I'll get John up and
have him meet you over there.

05:44.166 --> 05:47.417
All right.
I'll talk to you later. Bye.

05:57.583 --> 06:00.625
Hey, bud.
Get your water bottle ready.

06:00.709 --> 06:02.667
Mrs. Evans is gonna
pick you up in ten minutes.

06:02.750 --> 06:03.750
Okay.

06:08.959 --> 06:12.291
I've felt better.

06:15.917 --> 06:17.250
What's going on?

06:22.417 --> 06:23.458
Erin's dead.

06:26.959 --> 06:28.000
Kenny's Erin?

06:48.625 --> 06:50.792
-Hey, Mare.
-How you doing, Mare?

06:51.542 --> 06:53.583
Hey.
Jesus Christ, I'm sorry.

06:56.792 --> 06:58.834
-I'm so sorry, Bill.
-It's, uh...

07:01.333 --> 07:04.959
Okay.
Let's just fucking do this.

07:26.083 --> 07:27.542
What the fuck?

07:34.166 --> 07:35.375
Uh, hey, Mare.

07:35.458 --> 07:36.500
Hey, Kenny.

07:37.166 --> 07:38.250
Johnny. Billy.

07:38.333 --> 07:39.583
-Kenny.
-How's it going, Ken?

07:39.667 --> 07:40.792
What're you doing here?

07:40.875 --> 07:42.041
Can we come in?

07:44.125 --> 07:45.166
Yeah.

07:57.458 --> 07:58.542
What's going on?

08:04.417 --> 08:05.500
What's going on?

08:06.166 --> 08:07.208
Kenny...

08:17.709 --> 08:19.208
Is it Erin?

08:19.291 --> 08:22.709
She was found dead out
at Creedham Creek this morning.

08:22.792 --> 08:24.750
-She was a victim of a homicide.
-No.

08:25.917 --> 08:27.125
I'm so sorry.

08:34.041 --> 08:35.125
Hey, come on, man.

08:35.208 --> 08:37.417
Stay away from--
Stay away from me.

08:37.500 --> 08:38.542
Okay.

08:40.250 --> 08:43.542
Erin? Erin?

08:45.083 --> 08:49.125
Fuck!

08:49.208 --> 08:51.834
Shit! Stay away from me, man.

08:51.917 --> 08:55.375
-Easy. Just take it easy.
-Shut the fuck up!

08:57.917 --> 08:59.166
You're gonna fuckin'--

08:59.250 --> 09:00.583
-Ken!
-You're gonna fu--

09:00.667 --> 09:02.375
-I'll fucking kill him!
-Calm down! Calm down!

09:02.458 --> 09:05.583
I'll kill him!
That's my daughter!

09:05.667 --> 09:08.583
-That's my daughter.
-It's okay. It's okay.

09:08.667 --> 09:12.834
No!

10:05.709 --> 10:06.709
Kenny.

10:07.834 --> 10:10.291
I'm gonna ask you
some questions, okay?

10:10.375 --> 10:14.083
I need you to remember
as much as you can, all right?

10:14.166 --> 10:15.959
So we can find out who did this.

10:17.834 --> 10:18.959
Who did this?

10:20.375 --> 10:22.166
One person fucking did this.

10:23.667 --> 10:25.542
Dylan Hinchey, DJ's father.

10:27.709 --> 10:29.542
Is that where the baby's at now?

10:33.875 --> 10:36.250
When did you last see Erin?

10:40.000 --> 10:41.875
Last night.

10:45.000 --> 10:46.250
We had dinner here.

10:51.208 --> 10:52.500
She asked me if...

10:54.750 --> 10:57.041
She asked me
if she could borrow my truck.

11:06.709 --> 11:08.875
Then she got on her bike
and she went out.

11:09.709 --> 11:11.125
Do you know where she was going?

11:12.875 --> 11:15.709
I don't know.
She didn't say.

11:17.208 --> 11:18.750
What time did she leave?

11:19.917 --> 11:22.417
Seven, 7:30.

11:24.625 --> 11:27.000
And, um,
did everything seem okay?

11:27.083 --> 11:31.083
You know,
anything different about her?

11:31.166 --> 11:33.333
You know, did she maybe
have an altercation

11:33.417 --> 11:34.834
-with someone or some...
-Oh, no, no.

11:34.917 --> 11:37.000
-Mare, you're wasting your time.
-...you know, conversation or--

11:37.083 --> 11:39.083
No one else had any reason
to hurt her except him.

11:40.250 --> 11:41.458
Why do you say that?

11:43.750 --> 11:46.208
He never wanted her
to have that baby.

11:48.583 --> 11:49.917
He hated her for it.

11:53.709 --> 11:55.166
Were you here last night?

12:01.959 --> 12:03.166
All fucking night.

12:10.166 --> 12:12.625
All right, go.
There's your mom.

12:12.709 --> 12:14.959
Mommy!

12:15.750 --> 12:22.041
Hey. Hi, bud. Ooh, I missed you.

12:22.125 --> 12:23.375
Good to see you, Carrie.

12:23.458 --> 12:25.792
-You ready to have some fun?
-Yeah.

12:25.875 --> 12:27.000
Whoa, look at you!

12:27.083 --> 12:28.959
She seems like
she's doing okay, right?

12:29.041 --> 12:31.417
-So high! Ooh! Whoa!
-Yeah.

12:31.500 --> 12:32.625
Whoa!

12:34.125 --> 12:36.041
Well, she was nice
when we came in.

12:36.125 --> 12:38.250
Well, we're not the one
she hates.

12:38.333 --> 12:40.083
-Woohoo!
-Hey, you hungry, bud?

12:40.166 --> 12:41.375
Wanna try to climb on this side?

12:41.458 --> 12:44.792
-Hey, you guys got some snacks?
-Oh, yeah. Sure.

12:44.875 --> 12:47.917
-You can't get me!
-Go.

12:48.000 --> 12:49.750
Thanks for
bringing him to see me.

12:49.834 --> 12:52.208
Oh, sure.
He was so excited to come.

12:56.458 --> 12:58.417
So, where are you living now?

12:58.500 --> 13:03.208
Sober house in Kennett Square...
...called Rebirth,

13:03.291 --> 13:06.166
as if we were all dead
before we got there.

13:09.000 --> 13:11.208
Well, we're all just glad
you're doing so great.

13:12.250 --> 13:13.291
Thanks.

13:13.375 --> 13:15.667
The only thing I'm missing now
is my son.

13:19.000 --> 13:22.875
I want custody. Full custody.

13:22.959 --> 13:25.500
I filed the paperwork
with my attorney yesterday.

13:27.875 --> 13:30.500
My mom, she--
she'll fight you.

13:30.583 --> 13:32.041
Yeah. No shit.

13:33.959 --> 13:36.583
But I'm his mom, not her.

13:40.083 --> 13:41.417
Thanks for the snacks.

13:44.959 --> 13:46.208
-Drew.
-Let's go.

13:48.041 --> 13:49.542
-Oh, snacks.
-Pay attention.

13:49.625 --> 13:52.041
We got snacks,
and we got some water.

13:57.750 --> 13:59.041
When did you, um--

13:59.125 --> 14:00.750
When did you
last see her, Dylan?

14:01.709 --> 14:04.500
I saw her yesterday.

14:04.583 --> 14:08.083
I went to go grab DJ
from her house around 3:00.

14:08.792 --> 14:10.041
And...

14:10.125 --> 14:12.333
I saw her out in Sharp's Woods,
like, last night.

14:12.417 --> 14:13.583
And what time was that?

14:13.667 --> 14:16.500
I dunno. Maybe 10:00, 10:30.

14:16.583 --> 14:18.709
Which was it, 10:00 or 10:30?

14:18.792 --> 14:20.333
It was 10:30.

14:20.417 --> 14:21.792
Was she there with you?

14:21.875 --> 14:23.417
No. She came on her own.

14:23.500 --> 14:25.583
-Did you talk to her?
-No.

14:26.959 --> 14:28.667
I mean, I don't really--
things aren't really--

14:28.750 --> 14:30.709
They're not really good
between us right now.

14:30.792 --> 14:34.333
"Aren't good between you."
What does that mean exactly?

14:34.417 --> 14:37.125
Like, we're arguing
about things with DJ.

14:37.208 --> 14:41.375
And we're not together anymore,
so...

14:41.458 --> 14:44.000
it's kind of awkward
to see each other.

14:44.083 --> 14:46.417
So the mother of your baby's
out in those woods last night,

14:46.500 --> 14:47.542
same woods you're in,

14:47.625 --> 14:49.542
and you don't say
a single a word to her?

14:49.625 --> 14:51.500
-No.

14:51.583 --> 14:54.583
Like I said,
things aren't really good
between us right now.

14:54.667 --> 14:57.959
-So we...

14:58.041 --> 15:01.250
Brianna.
Is that Brianna Delrasso?

15:01.333 --> 15:04.000
-Is she your new girlfriend?
-I don't have a new girlfriend.

15:04.083 --> 15:05.750
What time
did you leave the woods?

15:05.834 --> 15:08.458
I got home around midnight.

15:08.542 --> 15:09.917
That's not what I asked.

15:10.000 --> 15:12.625
I asked you what time
you left the woods.

15:13.542 --> 15:16.709
Well, if I got home
around midnight,

15:16.792 --> 15:19.166
then I probably left
the woods at 11:45.

15:19.250 --> 15:20.917
You can ask my mom
if you want to.

15:21.000 --> 15:22.792
-Why would I ask your mom?

15:22.875 --> 15:25.583
-Because she was awake--
-It's okay if you want to
go ahead and get that.

15:25.667 --> 15:27.792
-You can-- I can give you--
-No. She was in the den

15:27.875 --> 15:30.542
and she was feeding DJ, and--
'cause his teeth hurt--

15:30.625 --> 15:32.667
and she wanted to
give him some milk,

15:32.750 --> 15:34.375
and she asked me to get some,

15:34.458 --> 15:36.083
and I didn't know where any was,
and--

15:36.166 --> 15:38.625
Well, I usually keep mine
in the fridge.

15:38.709 --> 15:42.500
Well...
the kitchen fridge was full.

15:42.583 --> 15:44.792
So we usually keep some extra
out in the garage fridge.

15:44.875 --> 15:47.750
-So that's where I went,
all right?
-Hey, Dylan. Dylan. Listen.

15:47.834 --> 15:50.750
Did you have anything to do
with Erin's death last night?

15:50.834 --> 15:51.750
No.

15:51.834 --> 15:53.208
'Cause looking
at things right now,

15:53.291 --> 15:55.000
you're the only person with
a reason to commit this crime.

15:55.083 --> 15:55.917
I didn't kill Erin.

15:56.000 --> 15:57.166
You're not gonna
put that shit on me.

15:57.250 --> 15:59.917
-I didn't kill her.
-I hope you're not lying.

16:00.041 --> 16:03.417
'Cause I wanna help you,
all right? I really do.

16:03.500 --> 16:06.291
Yeah, I get that things couldn't
have been easy for you two.

16:06.375 --> 16:07.458
You're young, you know?

16:07.542 --> 16:11.291
Fighting over money,
sharing custody of a kid.

16:11.375 --> 16:14.333
You know, being a single parent,
that-- that's a struggle.

16:14.417 --> 16:16.125
That struggle is
fucking real, right?

16:16.208 --> 16:17.709
I get that. I get that.

16:20.750 --> 16:22.917
Was she making you pay
for that ear surgery?

16:29.041 --> 16:31.458
You said that I could leave
whenever I wanted to, right?

16:31.542 --> 16:33.208
Yeah, but the second
you walk out of here,

16:33.291 --> 16:34.458
I can't help you anymore,

16:34.542 --> 16:36.625
so if you've got something
you want to tell me,

16:36.709 --> 16:37.834
you better do it now,

16:37.917 --> 16:39.959
'cause as soon as you leave
this station,

16:40.041 --> 16:42.417
I'm gonna start digging
through your life

16:42.500 --> 16:44.291
and I'm gonna
find out everything.

16:44.959 --> 16:46.709
Every thing.

16:48.250 --> 16:52.583
And if you're lying to me,
it's gonna be very bad for you.

16:56.083 --> 16:57.458
I didn't fucking kill her.

17:03.000 --> 17:04.667
The Easttown
Police Department

17:04.750 --> 17:08.291
received a call
at 6:47 this morning...

17:08.375 --> 17:11.709
from an individual who was
out hiking in Sharp's Woods,

17:11.792 --> 17:13.166
reporting a dead body

17:13.250 --> 17:15.000
-in Creedham Creek.

17:15.083 --> 17:18.333
-An officer responded
to the call,

17:18.417 --> 17:21.417
and the body of 17-year-old
Erin McMenamin of Easttown

17:21.500 --> 17:23.333
was found and pronounced dead
at the scene

17:23.417 --> 17:26.667
by the township medic
at 7:14 a.m.

17:26.750 --> 17:30.625
Right now, we're asking parents,
if they know their child

17:30.709 --> 17:32.250
was out in those woods
last night

17:32.333 --> 17:34.875
and might have seen something
or heard something,

17:34.959 --> 17:36.959
please come forward.

17:37.041 --> 17:39.500
Every bit of information
helps at this point.

17:40.709 --> 17:42.542
At this time, I'll turn it over
to Chief Carter

17:42.625 --> 17:43.709
to field any questions.

17:43.792 --> 17:46.291
-Chief, do you believe right now

17:46.375 --> 17:48.000
that this is
in any way connected

17:48.083 --> 17:49.750
to the disappearance
of Katie Bailey?

17:49.834 --> 17:52.792
We're not investigating them
as related incidents right now,

17:52.875 --> 17:54.166
-but we're not rule--

17:54.250 --> 17:56.166
...but we're not
ruling anything out.

17:56.250 --> 17:57.875
What do you
wanna say to the community

17:57.959 --> 17:59.792
now that a second young girl
is gone?

17:59.875 --> 18:02.208
-Yeah, Chief.
What do you have to say?

18:02.291 --> 18:05.542
First of all, we don't know
what happened to Katie Bailey.

18:05.625 --> 18:07.333
And why is that, Chief?

18:07.875 --> 18:09.083
It's been a year.

18:09.166 --> 18:11.500
Why do you still not know
what happened to my daughter?

18:15.333 --> 18:18.458
Hey. Hey.
Calm down. Calm down.

18:18.542 --> 18:20.583
We've decided to bring in
a county detective

18:20.667 --> 18:22.208
to assist with the case.

18:22.291 --> 18:25.417
Finally! Why don't you make it
somebody fucking competent?

18:25.500 --> 18:28.542
-Oh, come on now.

18:28.625 --> 18:31.166
Bring Katie home!
Bring Katie home!

18:31.250 --> 18:34.417
-Listen, I understand!

18:34.500 --> 18:37.542
Bring Katie home!
Bring Katie home!

18:46.667 --> 18:48.709
Looking for anything
in particular?

18:49.834 --> 18:54.375
Uh, no. Sorry.
Just habit, I guess.

18:54.458 --> 18:55.542
Detective Sergeant Sheehan,

18:55.625 --> 18:58.208
I'm, uh, Detective Colin Zabel,
with the county.

19:00.041 --> 19:01.792
Mind moving your...

19:01.875 --> 19:05.208
Oh. Right. Right.

19:08.709 --> 19:13.208
Um, well, I hope you don't mind,
I, uh--

19:13.291 --> 19:16.083
I asked the secretary here
to pull me Katie Bailey's file.

19:16.166 --> 19:18.041
-I was gonna read--
-Why would I mind?

19:20.166 --> 19:21.208
Right.

19:22.500 --> 19:26.458
Well, listen, uh, I don't know
what your process is, but--

19:26.542 --> 19:29.291
Mine usually starts
with a ten-minute smoke break.

19:48.291 --> 19:50.208
I'm sure
you're all aware by now

19:50.291 --> 19:53.917
that a young girl,
a member of this community,

19:54.000 --> 19:56.417
was taken from us far too soon.

20:00.208 --> 20:02.291
My first assignment
as a deacon

20:02.375 --> 20:05.291
was a campus ministry
up at Merrimack College.

20:06.250 --> 20:08.208
One morning, I stepped out
of the monastery

20:08.291 --> 20:10.667
and a woman came
running up to me

20:10.750 --> 20:13.208
and began yelling at me
at the top of her lungs,

20:13.291 --> 20:15.750
cursing God, cursing me.

20:15.834 --> 20:17.500
And somewhere
in all the anguish,

20:17.583 --> 20:18.834
I was able to piece together

20:18.917 --> 20:23.709
that she had lost her boyfriend
in a motorcycle accident.

20:23.792 --> 20:27.917
She looked at me as if to say,
"Say something.

20:28.000 --> 20:30.291
Go on. Defend your God."

20:31.625 --> 20:34.291
I didn't-- I didn't know
what to say. And I froze.

20:35.041 --> 20:36.542
What do we say to one another

20:36.625 --> 20:40.458
when faced with
an unspeakable tragedy

20:40.542 --> 20:42.166
like the one
that claimed the life

20:42.250 --> 20:47.000
of a beautiful daughter
and mother like Erin McMenamin?

20:48.000 --> 20:49.792
Truthfully, I don't know.

20:50.959 --> 20:54.041
But my thoughts often
drift back to Merrimack.

20:54.125 --> 20:55.917
And if I had to
do it over again,

20:56.000 --> 20:57.250
what would I say to that woman

20:57.333 --> 21:00.500
whose life had been turned
upside down that morning?

21:01.834 --> 21:07.125
I think I would sit down
beside her and say simply...

21:08.875 --> 21:10.000
"I'm here."

21:12.750 --> 21:14.583
That was a lovely sermon, Mark.

21:14.667 --> 21:15.959
Thank you, Dan.

21:17.709 --> 21:20.125
Wasn't Erin with
our youth program for a while?

21:20.500 --> 21:21.625
Yes.

21:23.250 --> 21:24.750
Did you know her very well?

21:24.834 --> 21:26.834
Um, no. Not really.

21:26.917 --> 21:28.750
I didn't spend
much time with her.

21:28.834 --> 21:30.333
And then she stopped
attending meetings

21:30.417 --> 21:32.125
soon after the baby was born.

21:33.500 --> 21:35.542
Did we keep track of her
after she left?

21:37.750 --> 21:39.583
No. Not as well
as we could have.

21:49.333 --> 21:50.625
A tip just came in.

21:50.709 --> 21:52.625
There's a video
from last night online.

21:52.709 --> 21:55.250
Oh, also the emergency
ping information you asked for

21:55.333 --> 21:57.083
from Erin's cell phone,
that just came back.

21:57.166 --> 21:58.041
Thank you.

21:59.542 --> 22:01.125
-Oh!

22:01.208 --> 22:03.125
-...stop texting my man now?

22:03.208 --> 22:05.041
This is taken out at
Creedham Creek late last night.

22:05.125 --> 22:07.625
I asked you
a question, you dumb bitch.

22:07.709 --> 22:09.458
Do we know who she is?

22:09.542 --> 22:12.250
Brianna Delrasso.

22:12.333 --> 22:14.417
What are you doing?
Get off of her!

22:14.500 --> 22:17.792
Wait, wait, wait.
What about her? Who's that?

22:17.875 --> 22:20.166
That's Siobhan. Mare's daughter.

22:24.959 --> 22:27.083
Write up a warrant
for Brianna Delrasso,

22:27.166 --> 22:28.333
get it over to District Court.

22:28.417 --> 22:30.667
Tell them I'll be there
in 20 minutes to pick it up.

22:34.834 --> 22:36.458
Hey, it's Siobhan.
Leave a message.

22:36.542 --> 22:38.458
-Hey.

22:40.250 --> 22:42.250
You need to call me. Right away.

22:47.125 --> 22:48.959
-Hey.

22:49.041 --> 22:51.166
Are we carpooling?

22:51.250 --> 22:53.333
I'm happy to drive myself.
I just-- I--

22:53.417 --> 22:55.041
You gotta give me the address.

23:02.792 --> 23:03.959
Thanks.

23:12.875 --> 23:14.583
Okay. We'll see you at 7:30.

23:14.667 --> 23:16.583
Great. Thank you.

23:19.083 --> 23:21.166
-Hey, Patty.
-Hey, Mare.

23:21.250 --> 23:22.792
Hey. Table for two?

23:24.000 --> 23:26.542
No. Uh, is Brianna
waitressing tonight?

23:26.625 --> 23:27.709
Yeah.

23:27.792 --> 23:29.041
Will you get her for me, please?

23:29.125 --> 23:31.959
-Sure. What-- what for?
-Just bring her out here.

23:32.667 --> 23:33.667
Okay.

23:35.417 --> 23:37.208
Are you friends
with these people?

23:37.291 --> 23:38.291
Yeah.

23:39.667 --> 23:41.834
Should we maybe do this outside,

23:41.917 --> 23:44.583
or away from the staff
and the guests watching?

23:44.667 --> 23:47.583
She beat the shit out of Erin
in a forest full of kids.

23:47.667 --> 23:49.250
Let 'em watch.

24:01.542 --> 24:03.083
Put your hands
behind your back.

24:03.166 --> 24:04.667
What the hell
are you talking about?

24:04.750 --> 24:06.417
You're being placed
under arrest for assault.

24:06.500 --> 24:08.125
-What?
-Mare...

24:08.208 --> 24:10.083
Let's go, Brianna.
We'll talk down at the station.

24:10.166 --> 24:11.917
-What for? Shit.
-You need to come with us.

24:12.000 --> 24:14.125
-Hey, hey, hey. Whoa, whoa.
-Mare? What did she do?

24:14.208 --> 24:16.083
-Calm down.
-What did she do, Mare?
Talk to me, please.

24:16.166 --> 24:18.250
-What's happening?
-Sir, I need you to back away.

24:18.333 --> 24:19.625
I don't know
who the fuck you are, buddy.

24:19.709 --> 24:21.125
-But, hey, can we just--
-Relax. Relax.

24:21.208 --> 24:22.959
Can we do this outside of
my dining room please, Mare?

24:23.041 --> 24:25.458
She knows what's happening,
Tony. She knows.

24:25.542 --> 24:27.083
Mare, talk to me, please!

24:27.166 --> 24:28.834
-Let's go. Let's go.
-Mare, I'm asking a question

24:28.917 --> 24:31.291
-as somebody that's known you
for the last 30 years!
-Just relax. All right?

24:31.375 --> 24:32.625
Stop telling me to relax!

24:32.709 --> 24:33.792
She's got my daughter
in handcuffs.

24:33.875 --> 24:35.250
Get the fuck off me,
you fucking bitch!

24:35.333 --> 24:36.500
-It's freezing out!
-Just relax.

24:36.583 --> 24:37.834
Put a jacket on her,
for Christ's sakes!

24:37.917 --> 24:39.375
All right. I got it.
We'll be in touch.

24:39.458 --> 24:40.500
-We'll be in touch.
-Mare!

24:40.583 --> 24:41.959
With these rights in mind,
are you willing

24:42.041 --> 24:44.125
to talk to us now
without an attorney present?

24:44.208 --> 24:46.208
Nope. I want a lawyer.

24:48.500 --> 24:49.542
Okay.

24:53.125 --> 24:55.834
So, we saw the video, Brianna.

24:55.917 --> 24:58.875
The fight in the woods.
You remember that, right?

25:00.583 --> 25:02.709
Oh, look. That's you.

25:02.792 --> 25:05.667
Yeah, you smash her
in the face, then...

25:05.750 --> 25:07.834
there's a part coming up
where she's lying on the ground

25:07.917 --> 25:09.375
and you kick her in the head.

25:09.458 --> 25:12.417
I think she's concussed.
Right, detective?

25:14.250 --> 25:16.667
I mean, I'll have
the medical examiner confirm it,

25:16.750 --> 25:20.542
but if that's the case, I'll
recommend aggravated assault.

25:20.959 --> 25:22.166
Lawyer.

25:22.250 --> 25:23.750
A felony of the first degree.

25:23.834 --> 25:25.417
-Lawyer.
-So you could spend between

25:25.500 --> 25:26.917
-two and ten years in prison.
-Lawyer. Lawyer.

25:27.000 --> 25:28.750
-Hey, okay. All right.
-Lawyer, lawyer, lawyer.

25:28.834 --> 25:30.959
I said I want a fucking lawyer!
Are you deaf?

25:31.041 --> 25:32.834
It'll go on your
permanent record, so...

25:32.917 --> 25:35.500
-Hey, Sarge. Sarge!
-...anytime you apply
for a job--

25:35.583 --> 25:37.083
Sarge! That's enough.
That's enough.

25:37.166 --> 25:39.166
You're a bitch. You know that?

25:39.250 --> 25:41.083
No wonder your son
fucking killed himself.

25:50.208 --> 25:52.834
Uh...

25:52.917 --> 25:56.333
Can someone come in here
and process her, please?

26:00.291 --> 26:01.333
Stand up for me.

26:14.125 --> 26:15.250
-Hey.
-Night, Jan.

26:15.333 --> 26:16.625
These are for you.

26:34.208 --> 26:36.125
-Hello?
-Hey. Uh...

26:36.208 --> 26:37.125
Oh, hey.

26:37.208 --> 26:39.041
Hey, thanks for the flowers.
Uh...

26:39.125 --> 26:40.917
I, uh--
I was hoping that was you.

26:41.000 --> 26:44.500
Listen, Richard.
I just, uh-- I--

26:44.583 --> 26:46.667
I wanted to call and just say
thank you for the flowers.

26:46.750 --> 26:48.250
Um, some things
have come up at work,

26:48.333 --> 26:49.458
-and it's--
-Wait, wait. Hold on.

26:49.542 --> 26:52.250
Before you abandon ship
completely, um...

26:52.333 --> 26:55.083
They're throwing
a party thing for me here.

26:55.166 --> 26:57.000
It's like an anniversary
reading of my book.

26:57.083 --> 26:59.458
It's not really my thing,
but, um...

26:59.542 --> 27:01.792
you wouldn't wanna
come with me, would you?

27:01.875 --> 27:03.375
It's just not really
a good time.

27:03.458 --> 27:05.625
-I'm sorry. I, uh...
-That's okay.

27:05.709 --> 27:08.667
It's fine. I understand.
Yeah. I, um...

27:08.750 --> 27:10.750
I saw that they found
that young girl's body.

27:10.834 --> 27:12.875
That's... that's awful.

27:13.709 --> 27:16.625
Yeah. Yeah. It's, um...

27:16.709 --> 27:19.375
Well, they're...
they're lucky to have you.

27:22.834 --> 27:24.417
When is it, your thing?

27:36.875 --> 27:37.917
Is Siobhan home?

27:38.458 --> 27:39.875
No.

27:39.959 --> 27:42.000
Have you spoken to her
at all today?

27:42.667 --> 27:44.875
No. Why?

27:44.959 --> 27:47.333
I called her
like 15 goddamn times.

27:47.417 --> 27:49.583
She's not picking up.

27:52.166 --> 27:54.125
You want something to eat?

27:54.208 --> 27:57.083
I ordered an extra cheesesteak
from Coco's if you want.

27:57.166 --> 27:58.166
I need to work.

27:58.250 --> 28:00.083
I know,
but you gotta eat something.

28:01.083 --> 28:02.959
I mean, before you lock yourself
in your bedroom

28:03.041 --> 28:05.125
and disappear down
a rabbit hole again.

28:05.208 --> 28:07.041
I need to work, Mom.
It's what I do.

28:07.125 --> 28:08.834
Yeah, that is what you do.

28:08.917 --> 28:11.041
Which is why I moved in here
to help out.

28:11.125 --> 28:13.333
You're not helping out, Mom.

28:13.417 --> 28:15.542
Sitting around
drinking Manhattans with Dan

28:15.625 --> 28:16.750
isn't helping.

28:18.208 --> 28:20.083
I think I do a little more
than that.

28:22.083 --> 28:23.417
How'd it go with Carrie?

28:24.375 --> 28:26.667
Uh, okay. She's fine.

28:26.750 --> 28:28.792
Did she say anything
about custody?

28:30.000 --> 28:31.542
Hmm? No.

28:31.625 --> 28:35.500
Oh, by the way, Drew was doing
that eye blinking thing again.

28:35.583 --> 28:36.583
All day.

28:36.667 --> 28:37.750
I told Frank.

28:39.417 --> 28:42.625
I'm gonna turn in.
You should too.

29:01.083 --> 29:03.458
-Hey, Mare.
-Is Frank home?

29:03.542 --> 29:07.166
-Yeah. You wanna come in?
-I'll wait out here.

29:09.291 --> 29:10.875
I guess you heard the news...

29:10.959 --> 29:12.792
-...about our engagement.

29:14.166 --> 29:15.166
Mm-hmm.

29:20.083 --> 29:21.333
I'll go get Frank.

29:23.333 --> 29:25.625
-Frank?

29:31.166 --> 29:32.834
-Hey.
-Hey.

29:33.542 --> 29:36.458
You two talk wedding dates?

29:37.333 --> 29:42.417
Uh, looks like August.

29:42.500 --> 29:44.750
Faye's son will be here
for a few weeks

29:44.834 --> 29:46.834
before he goes back to college.

29:49.000 --> 29:51.625
I'm assuming
I'll be the maid of honor.

29:51.709 --> 29:55.000
Not a chance in hell.

30:01.041 --> 30:03.125
Drew's blinking his eyes again.

30:03.208 --> 30:04.625
Yeah.

30:04.709 --> 30:06.875
I'm gonna call Dr. Long
in the morning.

30:06.959 --> 30:08.250
That the new pediatrician?

30:08.333 --> 30:11.083
She said she'd give us
a neurology referral.

30:11.166 --> 30:13.041
I think it'll be worthwhile.

30:14.667 --> 30:17.083
Yeah. Good.

30:17.166 --> 30:20.709
I'll swing by there
on my way to work tomorrow.

30:20.792 --> 30:23.166
-Are you sure? I'm-- I'm off.
-Yeah. It's fine.

30:23.250 --> 30:24.250
I'll go.

30:27.166 --> 30:28.375
Goodnight, Frank.

30:29.917 --> 30:31.083
Goodnight, Mare.

30:32.875 --> 30:35.000
Hey, Mare. Uh, wait.

30:40.542 --> 30:43.291
I saw the press conference.

30:44.750 --> 30:46.458
Erin McMenamin?

30:48.417 --> 30:49.542
How's that going?

30:49.625 --> 30:52.917
Ugh. We're looking at family.
You know, boyfriend.

30:55.709 --> 30:59.041
What was--
what was she like in school?

30:59.125 --> 31:01.458
I had her for algebra
a couple years ago.

31:01.542 --> 31:04.542
Uh, just a quiet girl.

31:05.875 --> 31:08.625
I didn't really talk to her
that much, you know? I...

31:09.959 --> 31:15.250
But I got the feeling that, um,
things weren't good at home.

31:17.166 --> 31:19.625
-She told you that?
-No.

31:19.709 --> 31:23.500
It's just... a sense I got.

31:25.917 --> 31:26.959
Right.

31:29.792 --> 31:31.291
-Goodnight.
-Goodnight.

32:09.542 --> 32:11.166
Where were you last night?

32:13.291 --> 32:14.959
What?

32:15.041 --> 32:17.709
When were you gonna tell me
you were out in Sharp's Woods?

32:19.500 --> 32:22.125
I-- I wasn't not going to tell--

32:22.208 --> 32:25.375
Someone posted a video
of the fight online, Siobhan.

32:26.000 --> 32:27.000
All right?

32:27.083 --> 32:29.333
I saw you going over to Erin.

32:30.542 --> 32:32.041
How do you think
it makes me look

32:32.125 --> 32:33.709
when my own daughter
is one of the last people

32:33.792 --> 32:35.417
to be seen with a girl
who ends up murdered

32:35.500 --> 32:36.583
and I don't fucking
know about it?

32:36.667 --> 32:37.792
I'm sorry.

32:43.375 --> 32:46.542
All right. What happened?
You-- you talk to her?

32:46.625 --> 32:48.542
Yeah. I just-- I walked over,

32:48.625 --> 32:52.917
and I asked her if she was okay
and if she needed a ride home.

32:53.000 --> 32:54.166
And what did she say?

32:55.458 --> 32:56.542
Nothing.

32:57.417 --> 32:58.709
Nothing?

32:58.792 --> 33:02.083
She just looked at me
and then walked off.

33:02.166 --> 33:04.208
-Walked off where?
-Into the woods.

33:04.291 --> 33:06.458
Was she alone? Was she--
Who was she with?

33:06.542 --> 33:08.875
No one.
She-- she was alone.

33:12.291 --> 33:13.625
That's everything?

33:13.709 --> 33:18.208
That's-- Nothing else
I need to know, hmm?

33:20.083 --> 33:21.834
Yes, Mom, that's everything.

33:27.917 --> 33:28.959
All right.

33:31.542 --> 33:33.041
I'm so fucking mad
at you right now.

33:33.125 --> 33:34.583
There's someone at the station
who might wanna

33:34.667 --> 33:36.500
ask you some questions
about what you saw.

33:36.583 --> 33:38.083
-Fine. Fine.
-All right?

33:39.208 --> 33:40.542
Close the door, please.

33:47.208 --> 33:49.000
Good morning.

33:49.083 --> 33:50.583
You must be Drew's grandmother?

33:51.333 --> 33:53.166
Yes. Mare.

33:53.250 --> 33:55.291
-Nice to finally meet you.
- Yeah.

33:56.041 --> 33:57.083
Have a seat.

34:00.083 --> 34:02.625
I appreciate you seeing me
so early.

34:02.709 --> 34:06.208
Figured I'd catch you before
all the sick kiddos show up.

34:06.291 --> 34:08.083
-Smart.

34:08.166 --> 34:11.542
So, what can I
help you with, Ms. Sheehan?

34:11.625 --> 34:14.417
Well, it's Andrew. He's, uh--
He's still doing the, uh...

34:14.500 --> 34:16.375
-the eye blinking thing.
-Oh, right.

34:16.458 --> 34:18.583
Well, like I mentioned
to your ex-husband,

34:18.667 --> 34:20.375
tics are very common
in young boys.

34:20.458 --> 34:21.291
Mm-hmm.

34:21.375 --> 34:22.667
Most grow out of them,

34:22.750 --> 34:24.291
and we normally
don't treat them.

34:24.375 --> 34:27.000
Right. Yeah.
Yeah. I know.

34:27.083 --> 34:30.542
Um, it's just his father,

34:30.625 --> 34:33.250
my son, Kevin, he...

34:34.792 --> 34:36.291
I don't know how much you know.

34:37.792 --> 34:41.542
Well, he took his own life.
It'll be two years in February.

34:41.625 --> 34:43.208
I am so sorry.

34:43.291 --> 34:45.667
It's just my ex-husband and I
were concerned

34:45.750 --> 34:47.667
that these tics, um...

34:49.875 --> 34:52.750
We don't know
if it's a genes thing, you know?

34:52.834 --> 34:54.041
If it's passed down.

34:56.792 --> 34:59.041
My son was like this
as a young boy.

35:01.333 --> 35:02.875
I mean, he was normal.

35:02.959 --> 35:04.959
Then he started having tics

35:05.041 --> 35:06.917
like the ones
Drew's been showing, and--

35:07.000 --> 35:09.417
What was your son's diagnosis,
Ms. Sheehan?

35:09.500 --> 35:12.709
Oh, Jesus. Uh...

35:14.333 --> 35:17.166
God. I don't even, um...

35:18.834 --> 35:22.750
My ex-husband was in charge
of keeping track of it all.

35:22.834 --> 35:26.041
There were so many
over the years.

35:26.125 --> 35:29.166
First, he was diagnosed
with Tourette's.

35:29.250 --> 35:34.417
Then pervasive
developmental disorder. Um...

35:34.500 --> 35:38.542
We were on the autism spectrum
at one time.

35:39.250 --> 35:40.583
Mood disorders.

35:41.959 --> 35:44.750
I can't even...
...remember which ones.

35:46.083 --> 35:51.041
We fought about it all the time.
The drugs, mostly.

35:51.125 --> 35:52.917
I was against medicating.

35:54.208 --> 35:56.542
I don't know
that either of us were right.

35:58.458 --> 36:02.542
We were dogs chasing our tails
for a long time, you know?

36:02.625 --> 36:04.542
-Right.
-Mmm.

36:05.625 --> 36:08.875
I had to check out
after a while.

36:11.542 --> 36:12.709
You know, it just...

36:19.083 --> 36:21.291
became totally
overwhelming, you know?

36:29.041 --> 36:31.083
Not being able
to figure him out.

36:34.583 --> 36:37.583
Sure. I understand.

36:41.083 --> 36:43.083
Well, I think it would be
helpful for everyone

36:43.166 --> 36:45.667
if Drew sees
a neurologist, then.

36:45.750 --> 36:47.959
Like I said,
tics are very normal,

36:48.041 --> 36:50.542
but maybe just
for peace of mind.

36:50.625 --> 36:52.458
Mm-hmm.

36:55.333 --> 36:57.667
Can I ask
if you're seeing anyone now?

36:58.709 --> 37:00.500
Just to talk?

37:00.583 --> 37:02.583
It's been my experience
that it helps parents

37:02.667 --> 37:04.083
-who've lost children.
-No.

37:05.041 --> 37:08.750
No. I never, um... Mm-mm.

37:09.959 --> 37:12.417
Well, if you ever
think maybe you'd like to...

37:12.500 --> 37:13.458
Yeah.

37:13.542 --> 37:15.041
...I'm happy
to recommend someone.

37:15.125 --> 37:16.125
Thanks.

37:21.792 --> 37:22.792
Thank you.

37:31.125 --> 37:32.208
Morning.

37:32.291 --> 37:34.166
Morning.

37:36.041 --> 37:38.709
That for me?
'Cause I got you one.

37:46.083 --> 37:50.417
Mare, can we, uh,
hit the reset button here?

37:50.500 --> 37:53.667
I don't even know
what that means.

37:54.625 --> 37:57.875
It means... this is your case.

37:57.959 --> 38:00.125
This is always gonna be
your case.

38:01.000 --> 38:02.500
I'm just here
to help you find out

38:02.583 --> 38:03.959
what happened
to those two girls,

38:04.041 --> 38:07.417
which, given your relationships
here in town,

38:07.500 --> 38:08.959
with everyone involved,

38:10.000 --> 38:11.500
it couldn't have been easy
on you.

38:14.083 --> 38:15.083
Okay.

38:17.083 --> 38:18.083
Okay?

38:20.458 --> 38:22.417
Okay.
I'm Detective Colin Zabel.

38:24.291 --> 38:26.875
-Come on. Come on.
-You fucking kidding me
right now?

38:26.959 --> 38:28.875
-Come on.

38:30.208 --> 38:31.834
Teamwork makes the dream work,
right?

38:31.917 --> 38:33.458
Oh, my God.

38:33.542 --> 38:36.417
You're the chef.
I'm the sous-chef.

38:36.500 --> 38:38.709
-What are we cooking?
-Stop talking.

38:38.792 --> 38:40.333
-Right.

38:40.417 --> 38:42.542
What time did you get
to the woods last night?

38:42.625 --> 38:43.792
Um...

38:43.875 --> 38:46.709
We got there maybe
at like 9:00, 9:30?

38:47.875 --> 38:49.709
I got to the woods about...

38:51.625 --> 38:53.125
maybe at 10:00?

38:53.208 --> 38:55.792
I saw her bike when I got there.
When I got back to my car,
it wasn't there.

38:55.875 --> 38:56.917
And you're sure it was hers?

38:57.000 --> 38:58.417
Yeah. It's a pink beach cruiser.

38:58.500 --> 39:00.166
You can't really miss it,
you know?

39:00.250 --> 39:02.291
And how would you describe
Erin's relationship

39:02.375 --> 39:03.583
with Dylan Hinchey?

39:05.750 --> 39:08.875
She was, like, more into him
than he was into her, you know?

39:08.959 --> 39:11.000
I mean, I don't
really, like, pay attention

39:11.083 --> 39:13.083
to their social lives
or whatever.

39:13.166 --> 39:14.834
I would say
that he's, like, aggressive.

39:14.917 --> 39:17.041
Do you know Brianna Delrasso?

39:17.125 --> 39:18.208
Yeah.

39:19.291 --> 39:20.375
She's...

39:20.458 --> 39:22.625
Total fucking bitch.
Sorry. Um...

39:22.709 --> 39:24.667
...like, jealous, you know?

39:24.750 --> 39:28.291
She's like a-- like a really--
like... bad person.

39:28.375 --> 39:30.125
So, tell me
what this fight was about.

39:30.208 --> 39:32.500
Catfishing, basically.
Catfishing.

39:32.583 --> 39:33.667
I don't know all the details,

39:33.750 --> 39:35.667
so I can't say exactly
what happened,

39:35.750 --> 39:38.083
but I would say
maybe look into that.

39:38.792 --> 39:40.125
Do you think Brianna killed her?

39:40.542 --> 39:41.500
No.

39:41.583 --> 39:43.083
She's all bark, no bite.

39:43.166 --> 39:44.583
What time did you get home?

39:44.667 --> 39:45.875
Oh, pretty late, like...

39:45.959 --> 39:47.333
Midnight, 12:30.

39:47.417 --> 39:48.542
Twelve-oh-five, exactly.

39:48.625 --> 39:50.041
Did you hear a gunshot?

39:50.125 --> 39:51.875
-No.
-No.

39:51.959 --> 39:53.959
-I did not hear a gunshot.
-No.

39:54.041 --> 39:55.083
What?

39:56.083 --> 39:57.125
Not at all.

40:03.417 --> 40:05.291
She was
your best friend, huh?

40:12.792 --> 40:14.750
-Here you go, sweetie.
-Thank you.

40:18.166 --> 40:20.375
Can you think of anything
that was going on

40:20.458 --> 40:22.166
in Erin's life recently?

40:22.250 --> 40:24.834
Did she mention anything
out of the ordinary?

40:27.083 --> 40:29.834
Every detail helps
right now, Jess, all right?

40:29.917 --> 40:31.792
It's really important, hon,
okay?

40:31.875 --> 40:34.500
Even little things
that might seem insignificant.

40:36.834 --> 40:37.834
No.

40:39.542 --> 40:41.125
I can't think of anything.

40:43.166 --> 40:44.291
Are you sure?

40:48.333 --> 40:50.917
I helped her get up,
and asked her if she was okay,

40:51.000 --> 40:52.458
and if she needed a ride home.

40:52.542 --> 40:54.750
And she said no,
and, you know, pushed me away.

40:54.834 --> 40:57.417
And-- and I've been thinking
about that a lot, you know,

40:57.500 --> 41:02.041
because what if--
what if she'd come home with me?

41:02.125 --> 41:05.750
What if-- what if I'd
pressed her harder, you know?

41:08.542 --> 41:10.542
You did everything you could,
Siobhan.

41:13.041 --> 41:14.083
It's not your fault.

41:21.583 --> 41:24.208
How do you like
working with my mom so far?

41:25.709 --> 41:28.291
It's good. Yeah.

41:28.375 --> 41:31.625
Uh, we're just
getting started out.

41:31.709 --> 41:33.000
So, um...

41:33.709 --> 41:37.041
Yeah. Any tips?

41:41.333 --> 41:43.291
Lower your expectations.

41:47.083 --> 41:50.542
All right. Let's, uh--
let's get you out of here.

41:51.959 --> 41:53.041
Thanks.

41:56.083 --> 41:57.333
So, what'd he ask you?

41:57.417 --> 42:00.917
Uh, just lots of questions
about what happened.

42:01.000 --> 42:02.917
-Did you see your mom?
-No.

42:05.583 --> 42:08.083
We interviewed
over 40 kids so far.

42:08.166 --> 42:11.959
Five confirmed seeing Erin
arrive on her bike around 10:20.

42:12.041 --> 42:15.583
And a witness said it wasn't
there when he left at 12:05.

42:15.667 --> 42:18.333
Uh, no one was seen
carrying a gun,

42:18.417 --> 42:21.000
and no one heard a sound
resembling a gunshot.

42:21.083 --> 42:24.375
The emergency ping
on her cell phone shows

42:24.458 --> 42:27.959
its last known location
was approximately 13 miles east

42:28.041 --> 42:29.500
of where her body was found.

42:29.583 --> 42:32.375
Ping stopped providing
information at 2:37 a.m.

42:32.458 --> 42:36.166
So the phone was destroyed
or the battery died.

42:36.250 --> 42:38.083
We'll get some guys out
to recheck the area.

42:38.166 --> 42:40.250
Any word back
on her cell records?

42:40.333 --> 42:42.208
Verizon security is
dragging their feet.

42:42.291 --> 42:45.250
Promised me tomorrow,
but they said that yesterday.

42:45.333 --> 42:46.875
Shit. What time is it?

42:46.959 --> 42:49.208
Uh, almost 6:00.

42:49.291 --> 42:50.875
Fuck. I gotta go.

42:50.959 --> 42:54.709
-Uh, Wawa coffee?
-Um...

42:54.792 --> 42:58.125
I fill mine up every morning.
Happy to pick up an extra.

42:58.208 --> 43:03.041
Uh, sure.
Two creams, no sugar.

43:03.125 --> 43:05.125
-You got it.
-Thanks.

43:05.667 --> 43:07.000
Have a good night, Mare.

43:08.250 --> 43:10.250
Good night, Mare.

43:10.333 --> 43:12.000
Why don't you have
a good "nightmare."

43:41.709 --> 43:42.834
Oh, fuck it.

43:48.000 --> 43:50.792
Mare.
Mare, we gotta talk.

43:50.875 --> 43:52.542
Come on.
I gotta be somewhere.

43:52.625 --> 43:54.750
Why are you doing this
to my daughter, huh?

43:54.834 --> 43:56.583
No. I'm asking you
as a friend, Mare.

43:56.667 --> 43:57.834
Brianna didn't kill nobody.

43:57.917 --> 44:00.125
You need to get back in your van
and go home, all right?

44:00.208 --> 44:01.583
She's not a killer, Mare.

44:01.667 --> 44:03.458
And I'm not gonna let you
ruin my daughter's life.

44:03.542 --> 44:05.458
-Get the fuck away
from my car, okay?
-Tony!

44:05.542 --> 44:07.208
Or I'll have you arrested
on harassment charges.

44:07.291 --> 44:09.417
-You've got two fucking seconds.
-Tony! I told you
not to come over here.

44:09.500 --> 44:11.333
-Mare, everything all right?

44:11.417 --> 44:13.458
Get back in the house, Mom.
It's okay, it's just Tony.

44:13.542 --> 44:15.333
-You kidding me, Mare?
Arrest me?
-Leave her alone. Stop.

44:15.417 --> 44:17.250
-You know Brianna
didn't kill nobody.
-Tony, stop. Please, goddamn it!

44:17.333 --> 44:19.083
-Jesus fucking Christ, Tony.
-You fucking know it, Mare!

44:19.166 --> 44:20.834
Give it a fucking rest,
all right?

44:20.917 --> 44:23.417
-Get out of my fucking way!
-I'm not gonna let you ruin
my daughter's life.

44:23.500 --> 44:24.875
Hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey!

44:24.959 --> 44:26.333
-You fucking hear me?
-Tony!

44:26.417 --> 44:29.083
You hear me? Fucking maniac.

44:31.542 --> 44:33.625
Christ almighty, Patty.
What's going on?

44:36.917 --> 44:38.542
-Oh, jeez.
-Sorry, Helen.

44:38.625 --> 44:40.542
No, uh... come on in.

44:42.250 --> 44:44.667
-Where's Ken?
-Upstairs.

44:44.750 --> 44:47.250
I think he is
down for the night.

44:50.375 --> 44:52.208
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Go. Go.

44:52.291 --> 44:53.583
-Be with the kids.
-Yeah?

44:53.667 --> 44:55.250
I'll take it from here.
I got it.

45:01.750 --> 45:02.792
You all right?

45:03.291 --> 45:04.291
Yeah.

45:05.417 --> 45:06.417
Okay.

45:09.250 --> 45:10.375
Get some sleep.

45:55.583 --> 45:57.125
Duck liver pâté?

46:01.834 --> 46:02.834
Thank you.

46:43.333 --> 46:44.417
Uh...

46:46.083 --> 46:47.709
Thanks, ladies. Excuse me.

46:55.291 --> 46:57.166
-Mare! Mare, wait.

46:59.041 --> 47:00.542
-Wait. I'm sorry. I--

47:00.625 --> 47:01.834
I got cornered back there.

47:01.917 --> 47:04.583
Yeah, whatever.
I'm heading home.

47:04.667 --> 47:07.250
Leave you to talk
to all your fans.

47:07.333 --> 47:09.625
Wow. I didn't see you
as the jealous type.

47:09.709 --> 47:10.959
Give me a break.

47:11.041 --> 47:12.625
-I don't have to talk to them.
-You invited me here, Richard.

47:12.709 --> 47:13.875
-You know? I'm standing there.
-No. I'm--

47:13.959 --> 47:16.083
-I mean, come on, man.
-I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Mare.

47:16.166 --> 47:19.208
To be honest,
I didn't know you'd show up.

47:19.291 --> 47:23.250
But you did, and you're here,
so... let's go back inside.

47:24.750 --> 47:25.917
I'm sorry, Mare.

47:36.041 --> 47:37.750
You're not getting laid tonight.

47:40.542 --> 47:41.625
Thank you.

47:41.709 --> 47:43.417
I'm sorry.
That's not the reason

47:43.500 --> 47:44.709
I'm asking you
to come back inside.

47:44.792 --> 47:46.166
Yeah, it is.

47:46.250 --> 47:48.083
You look beautiful,
by the way.

48:11.667 --> 48:12.792
Everything all right?

48:12.875 --> 48:14.667
Yeah. I'm just gonna
take a ride over to the store.

48:14.750 --> 48:16.709
-You guys want anything?
-Do you really think you should
be going out right now?

48:16.792 --> 48:18.375
-I didn't do anything.
-Babe...

48:18.458 --> 48:21.709
I'm not gonna sit here
in this fucking house

48:21.792 --> 48:24.125
-like a fucking hermit, okay?
-D, we know.

48:24.208 --> 48:25.500
We know you
didn't do anything, D.

48:25.583 --> 48:26.959
Come on.

48:29.500 --> 48:31.583
Can I get a pack of Boros?

48:35.417 --> 48:36.542
Can I have a pack of cigarettes,

48:36.625 --> 48:38.333
or are you just gonna keep
staring at me?

49:20.834 --> 49:24.834
Drive. Out to the turnpike.

49:24.917 --> 49:27.291
Mr. McMenamin.
I swear I didn't kill her.

49:27.375 --> 49:28.917
I swear to you
I didn't kill her.

49:29.000 --> 49:30.917
Shut the fuck up.

49:33.208 --> 49:35.208
Drive out to the turnpike.

49:35.291 --> 49:38.250
-You understand me?
-Yeah.

50:47.125 --> 50:48.125
Hey, Dawn.

50:49.959 --> 50:53.083
Forty on three, please.

50:57.166 --> 50:58.458
How you feeling?

50:59.834 --> 51:01.375
Fine.

51:26.166 --> 51:29.250
What are you doing, Tony?

51:29.333 --> 51:31.333
Oh, I'm just picking up
some things.

51:46.375 --> 51:48.792
You need to walk out of here
and go home.

51:51.041 --> 51:52.709
I don't know
what you're talking about.

51:52.792 --> 51:54.250
I'm just buying milk.

51:54.333 --> 51:56.375
Your daughter beat
the shit out of a girl

51:56.458 --> 51:58.375
who wound up dead in a creek.

51:58.458 --> 52:01.000
What part of that
don't you fucking understand?

52:02.458 --> 52:03.792
You can keep going down
this road,

52:03.875 --> 52:05.709
but you're not gonna like
how it ends.

52:06.542 --> 52:08.458
Leave her alone, Tony.

52:09.625 --> 52:11.417
What the hell
are you defending her for?

52:11.500 --> 52:15.542
Huh? What's she ever done
for you, Dawn? Or Katie?

52:20.709 --> 52:22.375
-Thank you, Dawn.
-Mmm.

52:27.333 --> 52:29.208
Don't take another step, Tony.

52:30.875 --> 52:32.500
What are you gonna do?

52:33.959 --> 52:35.375
You gonna stop me?

52:40.417 --> 52:42.792
Okay. Okay.

52:44.291 --> 52:45.917
-Jess?

52:54.208 --> 52:55.542
Oh, babe.

53:00.792 --> 53:03.583
I know this is so hard.

53:07.125 --> 53:09.041
Erin told me a secret.

53:11.458 --> 53:14.417
She made me promise
never to tell anyone.

54:06.917 --> 54:08.083
Are you okay?

54:08.834 --> 54:10.083
What the hell was that?

54:10.875 --> 54:13.166
That was an angry,
scared father.

54:18.041 --> 54:19.125
What's this?

54:19.208 --> 54:21.208
Um, Dad got served.

54:21.291 --> 54:23.333
Carrie's filing for custody
of Drew.

54:33.583 --> 54:36.333
-Hi, Ryan.
-Hi, Ms. Riley.

54:37.166 --> 54:39.208
Is-- is your mom home?

54:39.291 --> 54:41.875
Uh, yeah. Come on in.

54:43.542 --> 54:45.166
Mom, Ms. Riley's here.

54:46.166 --> 54:47.500
Hey, Trish.

54:47.583 --> 54:48.917
Hi, Lor.

54:49.000 --> 54:50.333
What's going on?

54:52.542 --> 54:53.625
Can we talk?

54:56.834 --> 54:58.000
Maybe in private.

55:09.834 --> 55:11.000
Slow down.

55:12.083 --> 55:13.083
Okay.

55:14.041 --> 55:15.500
Pull in here.

55:15.583 --> 55:16.792
-Here?
-Pull in here!

55:16.875 --> 55:17.917
This one? Oh.

55:20.333 --> 55:24.083
Stop.
Turn it off and get out.

55:29.375 --> 55:30.500
Walk.

55:30.583 --> 55:32.166
Walk. Walk!

55:36.875 --> 55:38.583
-Mr. McMenamin, please.
-Shut up!

55:38.667 --> 55:40.458
-I'm begging you, please.
-Walk.

55:40.542 --> 55:41.792
-I'm a kid. Come on.
-Walk!

55:41.875 --> 55:43.291
-Please.
-Shut up and walk!

55:54.500 --> 55:56.583
There's something
I want to tell you...

55:57.917 --> 55:59.083
about Erin.

56:02.125 --> 56:03.208
What is it?

56:06.208 --> 56:08.542
Dylan isn't the baby's
real father.

56:14.458 --> 56:19.792
So why come here instead of
go straight to the police?

56:19.875 --> 56:22.125
Well, Erin wouldn't tell me

56:22.208 --> 56:24.792
who the real father was, but...

56:27.917 --> 56:29.959
but I think it's Frank Sheehan.

59:01.583 --> 59:04.000
Jess Riley came over
to the house late last night.

59:04.083 --> 59:07.667
She told me Dylan Hinchey
isn't DJ's real father.

59:08.000 --> 59:08.959
What?!

59:09.959 --> 59:10.750
Zabel.

59:11.125 --> 59:13.917
Deacon Mark was the last call
Erin McMenamin made.

59:14.458 --> 59:16.041
We're gonna question him
right here.

59:16.625 --> 59:18.917
-The house of God?
-Makes it harder for him to lie.

59:19.625 --> 59:21.333
We're looking for Deacon Mark,
is he in?

59:22.875 --> 59:23.875
What's going on?

59:23.959 --> 59:25.208
Ask your father. He lied to me.

59:25.291 --> 59:27.333
Where the hell did you even
hear crap like that, anyway?

59:28.458 --> 59:29.750
Why the hell
were you calling her?

59:29.834 --> 59:32.000
I want to find out how this
whole custody thing works!

59:32.458 --> 59:35.208
I want my son back 'cause he
deserves a lot better than you.

59:35.291 --> 59:37.291
I know what you've been through.

59:38.750 --> 59:40.291
And I know you're worth saving.
