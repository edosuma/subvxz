[instrumental music]

00:18.498 --> 00:22.294
[instrumental music]

00:31.386 --> 00:35.140
Do you have anything else
planned for me today?

00:35.140 --> 00:37.309
Well, if you'd just
listened to me.

00:37.309 --> 00:40.520
I don't need you to manage me.

00:43.731 --> 00:45.942
[man 1] Hi, guys.

00:47.819 --> 00:51.614
[instrumental music]

01:17.056 --> 01:18.808
[bin door opens]

01:20.518 --> 01:24.273
[music continues]

01:26.858 --> 01:28.818
Here you go.

01:28.818 --> 01:30.362
You deserve it.

01:30.362 --> 01:32.655
About time, right?

01:36.576 --> 01:37.535
Hm.

01:37.535 --> 01:39.163
[crunch]

01:39.163 --> 01:40.872
[tense music]

01:40.872 --> 01:44.500
[man groans]

01:46.836 --> 01:49.340
[coughing]

01:52.134 --> 01:54.719
[coughing]

01:55.511 --> 01:56.804
You okay?

01:56.804 --> 02:00.392
[choking]

02:02.936 --> 02:04.479
[coughs]

02:04.479 --> 02:06.022
[body thuds]

02:06.357 --> 02:09.943
[choking]

02:17.409 --> 02:20.245
Help! My husband,
isn't breathing!

02:20.245 --> 02:23.290
[Kate]Okay, murder junkies.
What did she do wrong?

02:23.290 --> 02:24.832
Intentional allergy attack.

02:24.832 --> 02:27.877
Well, I guess the classics
never go out of style.

02:27.877 --> 02:30.672
But, honey, throwing out
the murder weapon

02:30.672 --> 02:32.131
at the scene of the crime?

02:32.131 --> 02:33.300
Hmm, should've known better.

02:33.300 --> 02:37.429
Now, let's look
at my top ten rules.

02:37.429 --> 02:38.930
Number one, make a plan.

02:38.930 --> 02:39.973
Okay, I'll give her that.

02:39.973 --> 02:42.684
But she really
flubbed the number two,

02:42.684 --> 02:44.727
"Appearances are everything."

02:44.727 --> 02:48.399
Her and her husband were seen
bickering by neighbors...

02:48.399 --> 02:49.524
No alibi, rule five.

02:49.524 --> 02:53.195
But I guess she did try
to hide the murder weapon,

02:53.195 --> 02:55.989
she just didn't do it
very well.

02:55.989 --> 02:57.532
Bad girl!

02:57.532 --> 03:00.493
[scoffs] Now, the police were
on to her right away.

03:00.493 --> 03:04.415
And she was combative,
not cooperating.

03:04.415 --> 03:05.665
And her best friend

03:05.665 --> 03:11.629
gave an interview that
spilt all of her secrets.

03:11.629 --> 03:14.757
Hey, lady, you gotta keep
your friends close

03:14.757 --> 03:17.844
and you got to control
the narrative.

03:17.844 --> 03:20.389
Some "best friend"
you got there.

03:20.389 --> 03:22.932
And that is how
her case was solved,

03:22.932 --> 03:27.229
so learn from
her mistakes, people.

03:27.229 --> 03:29.689
Now, this wraps up today's case.

03:29.689 --> 03:35.695
And a reminder... my first
true crime docu-series

03:35.695 --> 03:36.863
starts streaming soon.

03:36.863 --> 03:39.283
And it will be filled
with tales

03:39.283 --> 03:40.783
of marriage and mayhem.

03:40.783 --> 03:46.122
More details to come. So make
sure you like and subscribe.

03:46.122 --> 03:47.040
[button clicks]

03:47.040 --> 03:48.583
As always, I'm Kate K.

03:48.583 --> 03:51.253
This is
"Good Wife's Guide to Murder."

03:51.253 --> 03:52.504
Slay safe.

03:52.504 --> 03:55.466
[instrumental music]

04:01.929 --> 04:03.222
[Kate] Gotcha!
[Matt] Oh-oh!

04:03.222 --> 04:06.351
[chuckling] You scared me.

04:06.351 --> 04:08.353
[chuckles] Okay, well,
next time,

04:08.353 --> 04:11.022
I'll announce my arrival
with a bullhorn.

04:11.022 --> 04:13.400
-Or some flares?
-Oh!

04:13.400 --> 04:17.404
Mmm, are you making that...
blackberry IPA again this year?

04:17.404 --> 04:20.615
You bet. I know how crazy you
went for it last year.

04:20.615 --> 04:22.284
Hm-hm.

04:22.284 --> 04:23.659
Mmm.

04:25.036 --> 04:26.497
What time are Peter and Lenore
coming over?

04:26.497 --> 04:30.292
6:00, I think. Though,
she might have to work late.

04:30.542 --> 04:35.464
Hmm. What do you think
about kiwi? Mango?

04:35.464 --> 04:37.131
You could do a entire
fruit theme.

04:37.131 --> 04:39.967
Oh, yeah? Taking advantage
of Massachusetts'

04:39.967 --> 04:41.010
lush mango orchards?

04:41.010 --> 04:45.349
[scoffs] You never take my
suggestions seriously.

04:45.349 --> 04:49.185
I'm the craft brewer, you're the
producer/influencer.

04:49.185 --> 04:51.813
-Let's stay in our lanes.
-Huh.

04:56.485 --> 05:00.029
[solemn music]

05:05.118 --> 05:07.579
See, how it's more of a twist?

05:07.579 --> 05:08.955
We're not making
toothpaste, babe.

05:08.955 --> 05:10.206
Doesn't have to
be complete mush.

05:10.206 --> 05:12.584
Oh, thank God
we're not making toothpaste.

05:12.584 --> 05:16.295
-Could you imagine green teeth?
-You'd still be gorgeous.

05:16.295 --> 05:17.589
[Kate chuckles]

05:17.589 --> 05:19.757
-Hey.
-Hey.

05:19.757 --> 05:21.217
The station was crazy today.

05:21.217 --> 05:23.970
And since I've been
promoted to sergeant,

05:23.970 --> 05:26.180
the paperwork never ends.

05:26.180 --> 05:27.432
I just wanted to drop this off

05:27.432 --> 05:28.975
before I head next
door to change.

05:28.975 --> 05:31.978
I'm making your favorite,
rack of lamb.

05:31.978 --> 05:33.480
Uh... Kate.

05:33.480 --> 05:35.273
You told me
to bring chardonnay.

05:35.273 --> 05:38.360
Oh, well, I thought
we were having salmon.

05:38.360 --> 05:39.486
-Lenore hates fish.
-Okay.

05:39.486 --> 05:42.364
Well, just leave it on the
counter and we'll get to it.

05:42.364 --> 05:44.657
-All right.
-Thank you.

05:47.619 --> 05:48.703
Where's Peter?

05:48.703 --> 05:51.164
-Oh, he's out for his run.
-Ah.

05:51.164 --> 05:53.625
Lunch break weights,
6:00 p.m. run.

05:53.625 --> 05:55.502
I thought he might
take a night off,

05:55.502 --> 05:57.421
but Peter's a machine.

05:57.421 --> 05:58.671
That reminds me,
I need to call the bar,

05:58.671 --> 06:01.257
make sure Lisa and Javier
have it all under control.

06:01.257 --> 06:02.842
No. It's games night.

06:02.842 --> 06:04.218
You need to learn
to trust your staff,

06:04.218 --> 06:08.973
and let them run Mendaville
for one night.

06:13.853 --> 06:16.022
Okay, fine. You, go get changed.

06:16.022 --> 06:19.443
You... you get one text.

06:23.863 --> 06:24.489
Hmm.

06:24.489 --> 06:28.159
What's the plan for this
year's couples vacation?

06:29.994 --> 06:33.206
Some of us have press
tours to plan around.

06:33.206 --> 06:34.957
What are you thinking?

06:34.957 --> 06:38.044
-Hawaii.
-Kate, honey...

06:38.044 --> 06:39.045
No, it-it'll be great.

06:39.045 --> 06:40.589
There's this local beer tour
for you,

06:40.589 --> 06:41.839
Lenore will get
her fill of nature.

06:41.839 --> 06:45.927
Peter and I can lay on the beach
and hit up the hotel spa.

06:45.927 --> 06:47.803
Everyone will be happy.

06:47.803 --> 06:50.056
[Peter] But Hawaii is
so expensive.

06:50.056 --> 06:52.476
And, uh, I don't think
it's a good time

06:52.476 --> 06:54.686
for me to be away
from the firm right now.

06:54.686 --> 06:57.481
Yeah, work is pretty busy
for me too, Kate.

06:57.481 --> 07:00.399
Okay, well, it doesn't
have to be now. It could be...

07:00.399 --> 07:03.695
um, in a month
or for the holidays?

07:03.695 --> 07:05.697
I think, we should wait.

07:06.448 --> 07:08.241
It's just...

07:08.908 --> 07:10.743
not the right time.

07:10.743 --> 07:16.082
Okay, vacation talk
is tabled... for now.

07:16.583 --> 07:19.752
[instrumental music]

07:20.169 --> 07:21.713
[door opens]

07:22.255 --> 07:22.755
Garrett?

07:22.755 --> 07:24.591
-[Garrett] In the office!
-I picked up coffee.

07:24.591 --> 07:27.969
-How's my favorite client?
-I'm not sure you need this.

07:27.969 --> 07:30.514
Gimme. You excited for our
sleepover tonight?

07:30.514 --> 07:34.183
Yes. But I'm not sure how much
you gonna be sleeping.

07:34.183 --> 07:35.434
Are you vibrating?

07:35.434 --> 07:37.019
[both chuckle]

07:37.353 --> 07:38.730
How's the schedule looking?

07:38.730 --> 07:41.733
-I just emailed you the latest.
-Oh.

07:44.695 --> 07:46.237
-Garrett.
-What?

07:46.237 --> 07:47.905
This is not what
we discussed.

07:47.905 --> 07:51.660
We're leveling up so you can
become an international brand.

07:51.660 --> 07:53.327
That means lots of press.

07:53.327 --> 07:55.580
It all starts with
this first docuseries.

07:55.580 --> 07:58.916
We need big numbers,
binging, ravenous fans

07:58.916 --> 08:00.627
who need more content
from you.

08:00.627 --> 08:04.922
And then it's T-shirts,
movie deals, you name it.

08:04.922 --> 08:08.510
Okay, look, I love that
you're so ambitious.

08:08.510 --> 08:10.344
And I love that you
believe in me.

08:10.344 --> 08:12.054
That is why I signed
with you.

08:12.054 --> 08:14.932
But, uh, Matt and I have an
agreement.

08:14.932 --> 08:15.891
We put our marriage first,

08:15.891 --> 08:18.729
and we don't spend more
than a week apart.

08:18.729 --> 08:21.690
Ugh, fine,
he can come with us.

08:22.398 --> 08:24.275
He has a brewery to run.

08:24.817 --> 08:27.320
What? This schedule
is a thing of beauty.

08:27.320 --> 08:30.823
It took me weeks to
finalize everything.

08:34.703 --> 08:37.997
Fine. I'll make adjustments.

08:37.997 --> 08:40.124
Thank you. I love you.

08:40.124 --> 08:42.043
I love you right back.

08:42.043 --> 08:44.462
Okay, so,
AM Boston tomorrow...

08:44.462 --> 08:46.088
What are you going to wear?

08:46.088 --> 08:48.257
I don't know.
It's a radio interview.

08:48.257 --> 08:49.050
So...

08:49.050 --> 08:50.384
When has that ever mattered?

08:50.384 --> 08:52.136
[both chuckle]

08:52.136 --> 08:53.597
[birds chirping]

08:53.597 --> 08:54.806
[instrumental music]

08:54.806 --> 08:57.224
[door opens]

09:01.270 --> 09:02.938
Oh. Are these the new creations?

09:02.938 --> 09:05.149
I just siphoned them
from the fermenter.

09:05.149 --> 09:06.735
It's not kiwi or mango,
but you definitely

09:06.735 --> 09:10.071
got me thinking about using
local fruit more often.

09:10.071 --> 09:11.864
Hmm...

09:11.864 --> 09:13.199
These are amazing.

09:13.199 --> 09:13.908
[laughs]

09:13.908 --> 09:16.911
So what time's the AM Boston
interview tomorrow?

09:16.911 --> 09:19.914
It's at 6:00, but I have
to be there at 5:15.

09:19.914 --> 09:22.124
You sure you want to sleep
at Garrett's tonight?

09:22.124 --> 09:24.669
Yeah, it's easier. It saves me
the drive in the morning.

09:24.669 --> 09:28.590
I have tomorrow off. I could
drive you while you chug coffee.

09:28.590 --> 09:29.548
[chuckles]

09:29.548 --> 09:32.761
No, you should sleep in
for once.

09:32.761 --> 09:34.887
Besides, don't you have
all this work to do

09:34.887 --> 09:37.390
on Mendaville, the Sequel?

09:38.140 --> 09:41.894
What? You used to talk about a
second location all the time.

09:41.894 --> 09:44.731
You were-you were scouting
places in New York, Boston.

09:44.731 --> 09:46.982
I can't find a space that
I love, and I don't want to

09:46.982 --> 09:50.027
get trapped in somewhere
that's not perfect.

09:50.027 --> 09:51.445
You know, market is
so saturated right now,

09:51.445 --> 09:54.323
everyone and their mother's
making craft beer.

09:54.323 --> 09:55.908
I don't know.

09:58.703 --> 10:03.750
First you shut down about
Hawaii, now... now this.

10:03.750 --> 10:05.126
-Are you okay?
-Stress, bills.

10:05.126 --> 10:09.046
State of the world, destruction
of the planet, the usual.

10:09.046 --> 10:10.131
Okay, well, if money is tight,

10:10.131 --> 10:12.425
you can always dip into
the docuseries cash.

10:12.425 --> 10:15.887
-I don't want to do that.
-Why not?

10:15.887 --> 10:17.930
That's your money.

10:17.930 --> 10:19.432
Matt, what's mine is yours.

10:19.432 --> 10:22.017
-We're, we're partners.
-I know that.

10:22.017 --> 10:23.394
But you've worked so hard
for that money.

10:23.394 --> 10:25.938
I don't want to toss it away on
a venture that could fail.

10:25.938 --> 10:30.234
It won't! You-you... You're
building your busine--

10:30.234 --> 10:32.486
I don't want to do it, okay?

10:32.486 --> 10:35.448
[tense music]

10:37.074 --> 10:40.369
Look, I'm stressed out and
I shouldn't take it out on you.

10:40.369 --> 10:42.747
But our deal with Stayaway
Hotels fell through and I have

10:42.747 --> 10:46.250
all this extra product
that I can't move...

10:46.793 --> 10:49.044
it's a bit of a mess
right now.

10:49.503 --> 10:53.382
It did?
Why, why didn't you tell me?

10:54.759 --> 10:55.844
I was embarrassed.

10:55.844 --> 10:58.889
People are upset and I'm the
boss, I take the blame.

10:58.889 --> 11:01.850
I get it, but you have to
tell me these things.

11:01.850 --> 11:03.810
We've-we've talked
about this.

11:03.810 --> 11:06.562
You don't have to remind me.

11:09.482 --> 11:12.736
You know, maybe this press tour
will be good for us.

11:14.612 --> 11:16.155
Some space.

11:19.575 --> 11:20.326
Okay.

11:20.326 --> 11:24.873
Right, um...
Well, I should pack.

11:29.043 --> 11:30.419
[sighs]

11:32.087 --> 11:34.089
[somber music]

11:34.089 --> 11:35.674
Hey...

11:40.387 --> 11:41.013
You...

11:41.013 --> 11:43.641
You never say you're
sorry after a fight.

11:43.641 --> 11:46.560
It's because I know
you know I'm sorry.

11:47.186 --> 11:50.022
It would still be nice
to hear.

12:00.909 --> 12:02.243
I'm sorry.

12:02.243 --> 12:04.871
I love you more than anything.

12:04.871 --> 12:06.413
I love you.

12:08.123 --> 12:09.751
Knock 'em dead.

12:11.210 --> 12:12.754
I always do.

12:21.512 --> 12:24.849
-[Kate] Hi, Peter.
-Hey, Kate.

12:25.683 --> 12:27.268
Have a good interview tomorrow.

12:27.268 --> 12:29.938
Thank you. Have a good night.

12:33.024 --> 12:37.695
[Cornelius]Good morning. Today,
I'm joined by Kate Kelsey

12:37.695 --> 12:42.575
from the popular channel
"Good Wife's Guide to Murder."

12:42.575 --> 12:44.869
-Kate, welcome.
-Thank you.

12:44.869 --> 12:46.078
I am thrilled to be here.

12:46.078 --> 12:51.083
You exclusively focus on
tales of mariticide.

12:51.083 --> 12:53.920
How did you hone in on that?

12:53.920 --> 12:54.587
Husband murder?

12:54.587 --> 12:59.091
That has a little bit more
flare in the MMO.

12:59.091 --> 12:59.926
MMO?

12:59.926 --> 13:02.053
Motive. Means. Opportunity.

13:02.053 --> 13:05.389
It's the, uh, the basis
of every investigation.

13:05.389 --> 13:10.519
And with husband murder, the
motive is usually can be juicy.

13:10.519 --> 13:13.815
Revenge, jealousy, power, money.

13:13.815 --> 13:17.068
[laughs] We're going to
take a short break.

13:17.068 --> 13:21.113
We'll return with more
from Kate Kelsey.

13:21.113 --> 13:23.198
This is AM Boston.

13:25.076 --> 13:27.202
Kate, this is my assistant,
Brit.

13:27.202 --> 13:29.956
-[Cornelius] She's a fan.
-Ms. Kelsey. Kate.

13:29.956 --> 13:33.250
Ahh! This is so amazing.
I am obsessed with you.

13:33.250 --> 13:36.503
I never miss your show.
And I always leave a comment.

13:36.503 --> 13:38.965
I once left a suggestion
about the woman

13:38.965 --> 13:41.550
who strangled her husband
with Christmas lights?

13:41.550 --> 13:43.552
Oh. I-I think
I remember that one.

13:43.552 --> 13:45.471
-Really? Oh, my goodness.
-Hm-hm.

13:45.471 --> 13:48.223
I mean there are so many
murder shows out there,

13:48.223 --> 13:49.934
but yours is so special.

13:49.934 --> 13:52.020
It's darkly sarcastic.

13:52.020 --> 13:55.899
Thank you for watching. I hope
you check out the new series.

13:55.899 --> 13:58.359
So, have you ever thought about
starting your own channel?

13:58.359 --> 14:01.528
Oh, my God. Yes! I want to be
doing what you doing.

14:01.528 --> 14:04.239
I'm just waiting for an
inspiration, you know?

14:04.239 --> 14:05.282
[Cornelius] We're up in ten.

14:05.282 --> 14:07.743
Well, I am sure it will strike.

14:07.743 --> 14:10.496
Good luck, Brit. Slay safe.

14:10.496 --> 14:11.998
[exclaims]

14:13.499 --> 14:17.169
[instrumental music]

14:26.012 --> 14:27.388
Hm.

14:30.516 --> 14:32.060
-[Peter] Hey.
-Hey.

14:32.060 --> 14:36.106
-So, how was your interview?
-I killed.

14:36.563 --> 14:37.481
Is Matt home?

14:37.481 --> 14:39.109
Ah, he should be.
It's his day off.

14:39.109 --> 14:42.361
I texted him last night.
He never replied.

14:43.320 --> 14:44.405
Huh? It's weird.

14:44.405 --> 14:48.701
Um, you wanna come in
and grab a coffee?

14:48.701 --> 14:51.996
-I, ah, I need a boost.
-Sure.

14:52.329 --> 14:54.331
I-I'll get that.

14:59.253 --> 15:00.504
Matt?

15:00.504 --> 15:04.050
-Where do you want it?
-Um, anywhere's good.

15:05.759 --> 15:07.553
Matt?

15:08.930 --> 15:11.473
-Kate. Stay there.
-What?

15:11.473 --> 15:13.101
Just don't...

15:13.101 --> 15:15.519
[Kate] Matt! Matt!

15:15.686 --> 15:18.355
No, no, no. No, don't.

15:18.355 --> 15:20.733
Matt! Matt!

15:20.733 --> 15:22.860
[crying] Matt!

15:22.860 --> 15:24.820
[sobbing]

15:26.405 --> 15:28.323
Call 911.

15:29.366 --> 15:30.659
[Peter] Hello, emergency.

15:30.659 --> 15:33.037
Yeah, there's been an accident.

15:34.205 --> 15:37.708
[Kate crying]

15:38.667 --> 15:41.087
[tense music]

15:41.087 --> 15:42.005
[Kate sniffling]

15:42.005 --> 15:45.549
[Kate whimpering]

15:51.055 --> 15:54.391
[crying]

15:55.267 --> 15:59.063
[indistinct radio chatter]

16:07.821 --> 16:10.741
It's okay to lay back
on this one, sarg.

16:11.492 --> 16:15.038
[tense music]

16:18.499 --> 16:19.875
No.

16:22.503 --> 16:24.963
I'm gonna need to take her
down to the station

16:24.963 --> 16:26.632
and decide.

16:26.632 --> 16:30.178
[Kate sobbing]

16:31.804 --> 16:35.432
[music continues]

16:36.475 --> 16:39.812
[crying]

16:42.648 --> 16:46.194
[Kate sobbing]

16:49.404 --> 16:51.032
[Diggs]You were in Boston
last night

16:51.032 --> 16:53.159
at the home of Garrett Lucas?

16:53.159 --> 16:54.743
[Kate]My agent. Yeah.

16:54.743 --> 16:56.453
What time did you leave?

16:56.453 --> 16:59.165
Look, it makes sense that
I'm your prime suspect,

16:59.165 --> 17:03.502
uh... you should always
look at the wife.

17:03.502 --> 17:05.003
But, um...

17:05.337 --> 17:07.464
we have to figure out
who did this.

17:07.464 --> 17:10.093
We have to, so...

17:10.093 --> 17:12.761
[sighs] Um...

17:12.761 --> 17:15.139
I left around 6:00.

17:15.139 --> 17:17.641
I know that because I saw Peter
on his nightly run.

17:17.641 --> 17:21.062
But you should check with him
to confirm that.

17:21.353 --> 17:24.523
What time did you get back
to the house today?

17:24.523 --> 17:26.567
It's a blur. Um...

17:27.235 --> 17:28.861
Noon maybe?

17:28.861 --> 17:31.738
That's pretty big window.
Anybody see you last night?

17:31.738 --> 17:33.365
Well, Garrett can confirm
that I was

17:33.365 --> 17:37.452
at his house last night,
and I left this morning.

17:37.452 --> 17:41.332
You just produced a show about
women who kill their husbands

17:41.332 --> 17:42.916
and get away with it.

17:42.916 --> 17:45.419
True crime is a popular genre.

17:45.419 --> 17:48.172
-Did you and Matt get along?
-[Kate] Of course.

17:48.172 --> 17:49.715
Any disagreements lately?

17:49.715 --> 17:54.220
-Not really.
-I'll take that as a "yes."

17:54.220 --> 17:57.639
Married couples squabble
from time to time.

17:57.639 --> 18:00.017
Squabble?
So there was a fight.

18:00.017 --> 18:00.934
I don't know...

18:00.934 --> 18:02.936
I don't know
if you could call it a fight.

18:02.936 --> 18:07.608
I think lot of people
were mad at Matt and, um...

18:08.650 --> 18:10.527
he took it out on me.

18:10.736 --> 18:14.698
But he apologized
immediately and...

18:14.698 --> 18:17.368
[whimpering]

18:17.368 --> 18:20.579
-Right on cue.
-What?

18:20.579 --> 18:22.956
The tears. You're doing
a very good job

18:22.956 --> 18:24.125
of playing a bereaved wife.

18:24.125 --> 18:28.754
My husband was just murdered.
How do you like me to act?

18:31.006 --> 18:32.591
Where's Lenore?

18:33.800 --> 18:35.178
Hm.

18:40.974 --> 18:42.517
[door opens]

18:48.149 --> 18:50.943
You were out there
the whole time?

18:50.943 --> 18:52.362
Kate.

18:53.028 --> 18:54.238
You think I did this?

18:54.238 --> 18:56.031
Sweetie, when word gets out,
the whole

18:56.031 --> 18:58.159
world will think
you did this.

18:58.159 --> 19:00.535
Don't call me "sweetie."

19:01.620 --> 19:04.081
[Lenore] Look...

19:04.081 --> 19:04.790
just...

19:04.790 --> 19:07.210
tell me what happened.

19:14.132 --> 19:15.509
[sighs]

19:18.679 --> 19:19.972
Did you confirm with the agent?

19:19.972 --> 19:23.725
Yeah. And he corroborated
her alibi.

19:23.725 --> 19:26.270
There's CCTV footage of her
arriving in the evening,

19:26.270 --> 19:27.646
and leaving the next morning.

19:27.646 --> 19:30.816
So she leaves the victim
at 6:00 p.m. That's 18 hours.

19:30.816 --> 19:32.276
She could have
found the back door,

19:32.276 --> 19:33.860
she could avoid
the cameras completely.

19:33.860 --> 19:35.487
She's not the type.
A few days ago

19:35.487 --> 19:38.865
she was planning their vacation,
a trip to Hawaii.

19:38.865 --> 19:41.827
Still. Her channel?

19:42.786 --> 19:44.955
She's our number one suspect.

19:45.373 --> 19:48.750
I'm telling you,
she wouldn't do this.

19:49.377 --> 19:51.920
There's no way she could have.

19:53.256 --> 19:54.840
You're too close to this one.

19:54.840 --> 19:59.052
She's your friend and you're not
thinking like a detective.

19:59.052 --> 19:59.886
I'm a sergeant now.

19:59.886 --> 20:01.930
Speaking of,
where were you last night?

20:01.930 --> 20:04.434
I mean, you're right next door,
did you see anything,

20:04.434 --> 20:05.476
did you hear anything?

20:05.476 --> 20:10.063
I was on shift.
Got home around 1:00 a.m.

20:12.149 --> 20:12.941
Peter?

20:12.941 --> 20:15.527
Yeah. He was out late, too.
No idea where.

20:15.527 --> 20:18.905
He tells me less
and less these days.

20:18.905 --> 20:20.283
Hm.

20:23.286 --> 20:25.329
You think she's innocent,

20:25.329 --> 20:27.248
I think she's guilty.

20:27.248 --> 20:28.874
We did always work best
when one of us

20:28.874 --> 20:31.626
was trying to prove
the other wrong.

20:32.627 --> 20:33.920
Diggs...

20:33.920 --> 20:36.131
Let me run lead on this.

20:36.131 --> 20:39.760
Please. I can do this.
Trust me.

20:42.596 --> 20:46.016
The precinct won't survive
another scandal.

20:47.142 --> 20:49.395
No mistakes this time.

20:49.936 --> 20:51.563
There will be consequences.

20:51.563 --> 20:57.986
Unlike you, I know all
about consequences... partner.

20:57.986 --> 21:00.113
[Garrett] What's going on here?

21:00.655 --> 21:02.283
-Garrett?
-Hi, Lenore.

21:02.283 --> 21:03.867
Where's Kate?
Are you charging her?

21:03.867 --> 21:06.912
It's Sergeant Thompson.
And not yet.

21:06.912 --> 21:11.501
Great. I'm her agent and
her lawyer. We're leaving.

21:11.501 --> 21:14.961
Tell me you didn't
answer any questions.

21:15.338 --> 21:16.506
-Well, I--
-Uh.

21:16.506 --> 21:17.839
I'm your lawyer,
so starting now

21:17.839 --> 21:20.592
you don't speak
to anyone without me.

21:20.592 --> 21:22.135
[sighs] This story
is blowing up.

21:22.135 --> 21:24.930
I've been getting interview
requests all day,

21:24.930 --> 21:26.390
and not just local news.

21:26.390 --> 21:28.934
This is big! Huh!

21:28.934 --> 21:30.143
No bad press, right?

21:30.143 --> 21:33.564
I-I can't even think about
that right now.

21:33.564 --> 21:35.399
Right. Of course.

21:35.399 --> 21:39.570
What do you want to do?
Whatever you need.

21:39.570 --> 21:41.738
Well, I, um...

21:41.738 --> 21:42.948
I can't go back to the house.

21:42.948 --> 21:45.326
They, they said
they'd tell me when, but...

21:45.326 --> 21:49.037
We'll go to my place. You can
stay as long as you want.

21:50.789 --> 21:54.668
This all feels like a bad dream.

21:55.252 --> 21:58.339
He's, uh... he's really gone.

21:59.507 --> 22:03.469
I... I don't know what to do.

22:04.302 --> 22:07.222
Oh, hon. Come here.

22:07.764 --> 22:09.141
Oh.

22:09.475 --> 22:12.894
You know what always helps me
get through stuff?

22:12.894 --> 22:13.437
What?

22:13.437 --> 22:17.107
Writing everything down.
It's therapeutic.

22:17.107 --> 22:20.652
Plus, later... you can use it.

22:21.319 --> 22:23.697
-Use it?
-You know...

22:23.697 --> 22:26.741
-It's material. Right?
-Garrett...

22:26.741 --> 22:30.704
I love you, but can you please
stop being my agent,

22:30.704 --> 22:33.206
and just start being my friend?

22:33.206 --> 22:35.292
Oh, my God. Of course.

22:35.292 --> 22:36.668
[sighs] My bad.

22:36.668 --> 22:38.753
[chuckles]

22:38.753 --> 22:40.130
Whoops!

22:43.216 --> 22:46.596
[Javier] Hey, Kate.
How you holding up?

22:47.846 --> 22:48.598
Javier, Lisa.

22:48.598 --> 22:52.225
Thank you so much for
setting all this up.

22:52.225 --> 22:54.769
Anything for Matt. And you.

22:55.979 --> 22:57.814
He was a genius.

22:57.814 --> 23:01.985
His energy,
his brewing expertise...

23:02.612 --> 23:04.279
[sighs]

23:04.279 --> 23:05.656
is gone.

23:05.656 --> 23:07.240
Is gone.

23:07.240 --> 23:08.783
I can't believe it's gone!

23:08.783 --> 23:14.206
I'm sorry, Kate, this-this
must be so hard for-for you.

23:18.043 --> 23:18.877
It's not just Matt.

23:18.877 --> 23:22.465
We're both a little on edge
about the future.

23:22.465 --> 23:23.507
Inventory sitting on shelves,

23:23.507 --> 23:24.966
ingredients rotting
in the fridge.

23:24.966 --> 23:27.470
We're thinking about
reopening later this week,

23:27.470 --> 23:30.431
reduced hours,
if that's okay?

23:31.306 --> 23:32.098
Um...

23:32.098 --> 23:34.267
You own the building now, Kate.

23:35.268 --> 23:38.021
Right. Right. Um...

23:38.021 --> 23:39.856
Sure, Javier, I trust you.

23:39.856 --> 23:41.816
I don't want Mendaville
to close.

23:41.816 --> 23:47.906
This was, uh, Matt's dream,
and I want to keep it alive.

23:51.535 --> 23:55.330
He shouldn't have said anything.
It's not the right time.

23:55.330 --> 23:58.584
Why the hell is that
detective here?

23:58.959 --> 24:00.794
Oh, it's a... it's an open wake.

24:00.794 --> 24:05.924
We, we figured, everyone
deserved to, ah...

24:05.924 --> 24:06.634
to mourn Matt.

24:06.634 --> 24:11.221
He's not mourning.
He's trawling for suspects.

24:12.013 --> 24:14.140
-He is?
-Uh...

24:14.140 --> 24:16.059
-I'll go talk to him.
-Yeah.

24:16.059 --> 24:18.479
That's not protocol.

24:21.314 --> 24:23.609
I'm gonna go grab a drink.
You okay?

24:23.609 --> 24:25.777
-Yeah.
-All right.

24:27.279 --> 24:29.657
[Garrett] Any idea where those
two were that night?

24:29.657 --> 24:32.200
-What?
-Well, they knew Matt.

24:32.200 --> 24:34.995
[Garrett] He didn't smash
his own head in with a...

24:34.995 --> 24:37.122
Wait, what was the weapon?

24:37.122 --> 24:39.625
The police don't know yet.

24:41.376 --> 24:42.836
Oh. Um...

24:42.836 --> 24:44.755
-Hi. Uh...
-Brit.

24:44.755 --> 24:47.966
I am so honored that
you remembered me.

24:47.966 --> 24:49.175
I'm so sorry for your loss.

24:49.175 --> 24:51.011
Do you work for the police
or something?

24:51.011 --> 24:51.970
I totally should.

24:51.970 --> 24:55.181
The local PD had a press
conference this morning.

24:55.181 --> 24:57.560
Matt was fatally struck
by a blunt object.

24:57.560 --> 24:59.562
But, at the moment,
no such object

24:59.562 --> 25:01.564
has been recovered
from the crime scene.

25:01.564 --> 25:06.026
Which means, the killer
either hid it, or kept it.

25:06.026 --> 25:09.780
-Who are you?
-You must be Garrett.

25:10.531 --> 25:12.616
I'm looking
for representation.

25:12.616 --> 25:16.537
Uh... She works with
Cornelius Boothe at AM Boston.

25:16.537 --> 25:20.332
Not anymore. I quit.
To start my own podcast,

25:20.332 --> 25:21.833
or web series.

25:21.833 --> 25:23.084
I don't know yet.

25:23.084 --> 25:24.294
Oh, I, I thought you were

25:24.294 --> 25:25.588
waiting for the right
inspiration.

25:25.588 --> 25:29.049
And I found it. Famous wife,
murdered husband,

25:29.049 --> 25:32.302
small suburb where everyone
has a secret.

25:32.302 --> 25:34.846
-It's perfect.
-Uh...

25:34.846 --> 25:38.016
And I def want your perspective,
but not yet.

25:38.016 --> 25:39.100
I'm laying the ground work,

25:39.100 --> 25:43.188
outlining the crime scene,
analyzing the suspects.

25:43.188 --> 25:46.650
And, of course,
I'm using your Top Ten.

25:48.526 --> 25:51.154
Oh. Is that Lenore?

25:51.863 --> 25:53.865
And Peter?

25:55.576 --> 25:57.327
Okay, tell me you're not
letting that little

25:57.327 --> 25:58.286
Eve Harrington scoop you?

25:58.286 --> 26:00.455
[Kate] Okay. I have better
things on my mind

26:00.455 --> 26:02.248
than getting scooped.

26:02.248 --> 26:05.543
I've been in denial.

26:05.543 --> 26:07.504
Someone killed Matt.

26:07.504 --> 26:12.092
In my house.
Probably someone he knows.

26:13.468 --> 26:14.678
[Kate sighs]

26:14.678 --> 26:16.471
They're probably here.

26:16.471 --> 26:18.473
And I'm the number one suspect.

26:18.473 --> 26:19.516
[Garrett] Wonder why that is?

26:19.516 --> 26:21.017
If detective Diggs
is focused on me,

26:21.017 --> 26:23.604
then no one is looking
for the right killer.

26:23.604 --> 26:25.313
No one's trying to
figure out why.

26:25.313 --> 26:28.233
Well, Matt could be
a bit of an ass.

26:28.233 --> 26:30.151
Half this town
probably wanted him dead

26:30.151 --> 26:32.278
for one reason or another.

26:32.487 --> 26:36.157
I'm sorry. I-I don't know
why I said that.

26:36.157 --> 26:40.036
Oh! This is what happens
when I skip breakfast.

26:40.036 --> 26:43.581
[tense music]

26:49.337 --> 26:51.005
I'm making a coffee run.
You want?

26:51.005 --> 26:53.550
Uh, yeah. The usual.

27:04.645 --> 27:06.020
[sighs]

27:07.522 --> 27:11.067
[tense music]

27:37.469 --> 27:40.597
[music continues]

27:40.890 --> 27:43.516
[Garrett] What are you doing?

27:47.479 --> 27:50.565
Matt went to
Littlefield Central, too.

27:50.565 --> 27:52.442
You... you never mentioned.

27:52.442 --> 27:55.278
Did you know him in school?

27:58.615 --> 28:01.117
Why is this page ripped?

28:03.119 --> 28:05.330
It was covered with slurs.

28:05.580 --> 28:08.041
I didn't want my mom to see it.

28:08.959 --> 28:11.169
Who would do that?

28:13.463 --> 28:14.464
No.

28:14.464 --> 28:16.007
[Garrett scoffs]

28:16.508 --> 28:17.968
It was mostly just name-calling.

28:17.968 --> 28:22.013
But there was always the threat
of something worse.

28:22.973 --> 28:25.225
Matt was your high school bully?

28:26.601 --> 28:28.186
Why didn't you ever tell me?

28:28.186 --> 28:32.190
I only realized it
after I signed you as a client.

28:32.190 --> 28:34.902
Of course, he didn't
remember me at all.

28:35.068 --> 28:39.239
I stupidly thought he might
actually apologize someday.

28:40.573 --> 28:44.787
Yeah. He was never really
good at saying sorry.

28:48.874 --> 28:51.709
Y-you're were holding a grudge.

28:52.753 --> 28:54.797
That's a motive.

28:55.005 --> 28:57.215
Kate, don't be an idiot.

28:57.215 --> 29:00.343
You're my favorite client.
My friend.

29:00.343 --> 29:04.097
And let's be honest,
he wasn't good enough for you.

29:05.933 --> 29:09.853
I'm not sorry he's dead.
But I did not kill Matt.

29:09.853 --> 29:12.982
He was still alive
when I left the house.

29:15.108 --> 29:17.903
When were you at my house?

29:19.070 --> 29:22.115
I was in the area,
so I popped by to see

29:22.115 --> 29:24.117
if Kate wanted a ride
into the city.

29:24.117 --> 29:27.161
-[Diggs] Did you see Matt?
-Yes. He answered the door.

29:27.161 --> 29:29.706
And told me Kate had
already left.

29:29.706 --> 29:31.249
What time was this?

29:31.249 --> 29:34.377
7:00, I think. I had tickets
to a play in Boston.

29:34.377 --> 29:38.131
-Curtain at 8:30.
-Can anyone corroborate this?

29:38.131 --> 29:40.174
My boyfriend was in the car.

29:41.384 --> 29:44.805
So you were the last person
to see Matt alive.

29:45.138 --> 29:45.889
[chuckles]

29:45.889 --> 29:48.433
Other than the killer,
of course.

29:48.934 --> 29:51.144
Why didn't you mention
this earlier?

29:51.144 --> 29:55.024
No one asked.
Am I supposed to do your job?

29:55.189 --> 29:57.400
-You didn't like Matt.
-[Garrett] Is that a crime?

29:57.400 --> 30:01.404
Maybe you went back later that
night, settle an old score.

30:01.654 --> 30:04.324
I went to pick up Kate.
She wasn't there, so I left.

30:04.324 --> 30:07.368
Look, I should have given
a statement earlier,

30:07.368 --> 30:09.245
but I've been focused on Kate.

30:09.245 --> 30:11.999
She's my best friend,
and my client,

30:11.999 --> 30:15.710
and she's heartbroken
over Matt's death.

30:18.088 --> 30:20.715
So you think Kate's innocent?

30:20.715 --> 30:22.425
Without a doubt.

30:22.425 --> 30:23.927
In fact...

30:24.510 --> 30:26.804
I think she's in danger.

30:28.306 --> 30:30.808
Okay. Thanks for the update.

30:30.808 --> 30:32.310
Yeah. Bye.

30:33.937 --> 30:35.355
-Well?
-It checks out.

30:35.355 --> 30:39.068
Garrett and his boyfriend
are on camera at the theater.

30:39.068 --> 30:40.110
Well, that doesn't prove much.

30:40.110 --> 30:44.614
Kate could've doubled back,
killed Matt after 7:00 p.m.

30:45.239 --> 30:46.240
I'm not ruling anything out,

30:46.240 --> 30:49.160
but you have to build
your case, detective.

30:49.160 --> 30:52.372
The case would be a lot easier
if we had the murder weapon.

30:52.372 --> 30:55.208
-Or Matt's phone.
-[scoffs]

30:55.208 --> 30:57.794
Well, we've done more with less.

30:59.170 --> 31:00.923
That's one of Kate's rules,
you know.

31:00.923 --> 31:03.174
To hide the murder weapon.
Maybe the missing phone.

31:03.174 --> 31:05.385
It's her trying to control
the narrative.

31:05.385 --> 31:09.222
Hiding the weapon
is every murderer's rule.

31:10.223 --> 31:11.599
[sighs]

31:11.849 --> 31:14.352
What about the letters?

31:21.192 --> 31:24.529
Hey, Kate, could I see you
for a second?

31:25.321 --> 31:26.739
Yeah.

31:31.577 --> 31:33.329
[Lenore] Could you tell
us about these?

31:33.329 --> 31:35.832
All of Kate's fan mail
comes to my address.

31:35.832 --> 31:38.626
These have been showing
up for a few months.

31:38.626 --> 31:40.921
Months?
Why didn't you tell me?

31:40.921 --> 31:41.964
I didn't want you to be upset.

31:41.964 --> 31:45.591
So, you really don't know
where these are from?

31:48.219 --> 31:50.180
Wait a minute.

31:54.684 --> 31:56.227
[Kate sighs]

31:57.687 --> 31:59.647
-Hmm.
-Hmm.

32:00.773 --> 32:02.900
[Diggs] Yeah, we can track
the postmark.

32:02.900 --> 32:04.861
What if someone was
looking for me?

32:04.861 --> 32:07.156
If Garrett has been getting
these for months,

32:07.156 --> 32:09.615
and suddenly they
show up at my house...

32:09.615 --> 32:12.452
Yeah, your channel does
make you a target.

32:12.452 --> 32:14.871
You never mentioned Matt
in your show,

32:14.871 --> 32:19.084
but you do call yourself
a "good wife."

32:19.459 --> 32:21.627
I could help you.
We should work together.

32:21.627 --> 32:24.922
Leave the police work to us,
stay out of the way.

32:24.922 --> 32:27.300
And I wanna ask you
some more questions.

32:27.300 --> 32:30.220
Oh. more questions.

32:30.762 --> 32:32.181
Great.

32:36.476 --> 32:38.519
This refines the timeline,
right?

32:38.519 --> 32:41.231
Thank you for convincing
Garrett to come in.

32:41.231 --> 32:42.732
But I can't answer that.

32:42.732 --> 32:44.734
This is an active investigation.

32:44.734 --> 32:48.279
[tense music]

32:53.160 --> 32:54.660
You good?

33:14.680 --> 33:17.809
[music continues]

33:23.023 --> 33:25.025
You like the fruity ones, right?

33:25.858 --> 33:27.277
Yeah.

33:27.693 --> 33:29.570
Strawberry ale.

33:30.738 --> 33:33.158
Thanks, Javier. Um...

33:33.158 --> 33:34.367
Is, is Lisa around?

33:34.367 --> 33:36.494
Yeah, she's in the stock room.
Why? What's up?

33:36.494 --> 33:40.414
I just was wondering if Matt
happen to have, I don't know,

33:40.414 --> 33:43.835
any disgruntled customers,
fired workers?

33:43.835 --> 33:46.420
I know you were already
questioned by Detective Diggs,

33:46.420 --> 33:48.298
but I need to find
my own answers.

33:48.298 --> 33:52.760
[sighs] Yeah, Matt pretty much
got along with everyone.

33:52.760 --> 33:55.638
He was the boss,
so, maybe that's why.

33:55.847 --> 33:59.059
Can you make sure these are
cold before Happy Hour?

34:02.187 --> 34:05.648
He and Lisa got into it
sometimes.

34:06.191 --> 34:07.984
Really? How so?

34:09.236 --> 34:10.736
Lisa is ambitious.

34:10.736 --> 34:11.946
She wants to take
our craft brews,

34:11.946 --> 34:15.950
partner with one of the big
brands, distribute nationally.

34:15.950 --> 34:18.661
There were some rumors
about her and Matt...

34:18.661 --> 34:22.623
what she'd be willing to trade
for a title bump.

34:22.623 --> 34:23.208
[scoffs]

34:23.208 --> 34:24.417
[Javier] It's just gossip.

34:24.417 --> 34:26.836
They would stay late,
work on brew recipes.

34:26.836 --> 34:30.215
They would fight and banter,
and then later

34:30.215 --> 34:33.718
all the tension would be...
gone.

34:33.885 --> 34:37.638
-[man 2] Hey, Javier.
-Just give me a sec.

34:39.974 --> 34:42.311
You shouldn't be here.

34:43.103 --> 34:46.480
-I, I own the place.
-Go.

34:46.480 --> 34:48.649
So, Lisa.
Matt and her fought.

34:48.649 --> 34:50.818
I thought bartenders were
supposed to be tight-lipped.

34:50.818 --> 34:53.654
-Does she have an alibi?
-I'm following up on Lisa.

34:53.654 --> 34:55.865
I'm following up on
all the potential suspects.

34:55.865 --> 34:58.910
But, when the husband of the
woman who makes a living

34:58.910 --> 35:02.496
talking about dead husbands
shows up murdered...

35:02.496 --> 35:04.291
I do have a hard time believing
that as a coincidence.

35:04.291 --> 35:06.584
I want justice for Matt.
I'm going to find his killer.

35:06.584 --> 35:09.129
And if you keep up with
your side investigation,

35:09.129 --> 35:11.422
you're gonna find yourself
for an obstruction

35:11.422 --> 35:12.924
of justice charge.

35:12.924 --> 35:15.302
Better than a murder charge.

35:16.677 --> 35:18.471
[sighs]

35:22.058 --> 35:25.395
Look, what about a, uh...

35:25.395 --> 35:27.605
a peace offering?

35:29.316 --> 35:31.276
Matt...

35:31.276 --> 35:33.861
had an apartment upstairs.

35:34.363 --> 35:35.863
We can look at it together.

35:35.863 --> 35:41.452
Or I can look at it,
and you can wait for a warrant.

35:50.212 --> 35:53.047
[Diggs]
So, this is Matt's man cave?

35:54.674 --> 35:57.260
When's the last time
someone was here?

35:57.802 --> 35:59.388
I don't know.

35:59.637 --> 36:01.764
Well, I need you to stay
where I can see you,

36:01.764 --> 36:04.309
and do not touch anything.

36:05.768 --> 36:09.522
This place is a mess.
Matt was a real neat freak.

36:09.522 --> 36:10.273
-Really?
-Hm.

36:10.273 --> 36:13.109
[Diggs] Seems like he might not
have been alone.

36:13.109 --> 36:16.529
That, that doesn't
prove anything. Matt wouldn't...

36:19.073 --> 36:20.658
What's in here?

36:20.658 --> 36:22.618
[Kate] Uh, I don't know.

36:22.618 --> 36:24.745
Let's find out.

36:26.789 --> 36:28.916
What the hell!

36:29.834 --> 36:31.378
[Diggs] Hm.

36:35.923 --> 36:38.175
Tell me, that's not yours?

36:38.175 --> 36:40.594
Of course, not. It's...

36:47.101 --> 36:49.229
Matt had late nights.

36:49.229 --> 36:52.648
And he had early morning
deliveries.

36:52.648 --> 36:55.901
"That's the beer business."
That's what he said.

36:56.736 --> 36:57.903
And I...

36:57.903 --> 37:01.615
I was worried about him
driving home tired.

37:02.950 --> 37:04.035
[scoffs]

37:04.035 --> 37:05.370
[mellow music]

37:05.370 --> 37:06.787
Sure.

37:07.163 --> 37:09.832
I'm gonna get a team in here.

37:11.834 --> 37:13.669
Were you aware...

37:13.669 --> 37:15.422
Matt was having an affair?

37:15.422 --> 37:19.133
I've never seen any of those
things before.

37:19.133 --> 37:21.010
I, uh...

37:21.010 --> 37:21.927
[sighs]

37:21.927 --> 37:24.555
I didn't know my husband.

37:28.851 --> 37:32.355
[pensive music]

37:36.485 --> 37:38.611
-Kate.
-Hi, Lisa.

37:38.611 --> 37:41.364
Yeah, if I won't talk to the
police, why would I talk to you?

37:41.364 --> 37:45.868
-Did you sleep with my husband?
-I have somewhere to be.

37:45.868 --> 37:46.952
All your theatrics at the wake.

37:46.952 --> 37:50.290
The sobbing.
The calling him a "genius..."

37:50.290 --> 37:52.124
-He was a genius.
-Yeah.

37:52.124 --> 37:54.877
I found your little
sex toy trunk.

37:54.877 --> 37:57.171
-Oh, you think that was mine?
-Yeah.

37:57.171 --> 38:01.634
As if I'd ever be caught dead
in a pleather G-string .

38:04.887 --> 38:06.597
We flirted at work and sexted.

38:06.597 --> 38:10.017
He sent me photos,
so I sent some back.

38:10.017 --> 38:10.976
We never had sex, I swear.

38:10.976 --> 38:14.523
Those toys must have been
for his other flings.

38:15.189 --> 38:18.776
He was my boss, Kate.
What was I supposed to do?

38:19.361 --> 38:21.153
Well, that sounds
like harassment.

38:21.153 --> 38:24.533
Did he... Was it unwanted?

38:25.241 --> 38:27.369
I wanted a promotion.

38:27.536 --> 38:30.287
To have more input in the brews
and the business.

38:30.287 --> 38:32.623
And it seemed harmless at first.

38:32.623 --> 38:34.959
I really did admire him.

38:36.503 --> 38:38.045
But later...

38:39.548 --> 38:43.175
Well, I had already gone along
with so much of it...

38:43.175 --> 38:45.261
Yeah, I knew you loved him.

38:45.845 --> 38:48.139
But Matt was not a good husband.

38:50.307 --> 38:53.686
Geez! Open your eyes.

38:53.686 --> 38:55.896
[pensive music]

38:55.896 --> 38:58.525
[scoffs] Oh, that, uh...

38:58.525 --> 39:01.861
That is the same...

39:02.695 --> 39:03.946
phrase.

39:03.946 --> 39:06.323
And you signed the guest book
at the wake.

39:06.323 --> 39:10.370
And the writing matches.
What is this, a threat?

39:10.370 --> 39:13.122
No. I...

39:13.498 --> 39:14.790
just wanted to warn you.

39:14.790 --> 39:16.750
About Matt?

39:18.711 --> 39:21.881
-Did you kill him?
-No.

39:21.881 --> 39:23.841
[music intensifies]

39:23.841 --> 39:25.552
You should go to the police
and tell them everything.

39:25.552 --> 39:28.888
So I become the prime suspect?
That works out nicely for you.

39:28.888 --> 39:30.264
No, they have all the rest
of the letters.

39:30.264 --> 39:32.434
Withholding evidence
just makes you look guilty.

39:32.434 --> 39:35.604
-Get out of my way, Kate.
-Hey, uh... Come on, Lisa.

39:35.604 --> 39:37.730
I'm just trying to help you.

39:37.730 --> 39:39.190
Like you were trying to help me.

39:39.190 --> 39:41.484
Oh, thank you.

39:46.739 --> 39:47.865
Can I help you?

39:47.865 --> 39:50.034
Hi. Is Peter Thompson in?

39:50.034 --> 39:50.910
He just left.

39:50.910 --> 39:52.621
I don't know
when he'll be back,

39:52.621 --> 39:55.789
nobody tells me anything
around here.

39:55.998 --> 39:59.043
-Do you have an appointment?
-No. I'm a friend.

39:59.043 --> 40:01.295
I could wait in his office.

40:01.921 --> 40:02.589
You're her.

40:02.589 --> 40:06.258
[chuckles] The, uh,
the husband murder lady.

40:06.258 --> 40:09.471
Kate K. "Slay safe."

40:09.970 --> 40:11.180
Yeah, that's me.

40:11.180 --> 40:15.392
[laughs] Oh! Big fan!

40:15.851 --> 40:16.894
You know...

40:16.894 --> 40:19.813
my husband's a real
piece of work.

40:19.813 --> 40:23.150
Ugh! Oh!
Like yours, I guess.

40:23.150 --> 40:25.986
Oh, no. I-it wasn't. Um...

40:25.986 --> 40:29.156
Matt and I loved
each other re...

40:29.156 --> 40:30.324
Oh, yeah, sure.

40:30.324 --> 40:31.283
[chuckles] I mean...

40:31.283 --> 40:34.328
we're all in love
until we're not, right?

40:34.995 --> 40:36.623
I think you're innocent.

40:36.623 --> 40:39.626
But, if you weren't, I get it.

40:39.626 --> 40:42.002
[whispers] Men are pigs.

40:43.337 --> 40:45.130
Thanks for watching.

40:45.130 --> 40:49.969
-The police were here yesterday.
-Oh, let me guess.

40:49.969 --> 40:54.932
Uh, a serious guy,
about this tall named Diggs?

40:55.266 --> 40:56.267
That's him.

40:56.267 --> 40:59.144
He was investigating,
you know...

40:59.144 --> 41:01.063
[whispers] The incident.

41:02.439 --> 41:06.235
Right. The incident.
Of-of course.

41:06.235 --> 41:08.613
He took a copy
of the security footage.

41:08.613 --> 41:09.614
-[Kate] Oh.
-Hm.

41:09.614 --> 41:13.367
And... I have a copy too.

41:13.367 --> 41:14.201
One for myself.

41:14.201 --> 41:17.622
You never know when you're gonna
need it, right?

41:19.415 --> 41:21.208
You know, Tammy...

41:21.208 --> 41:25.879
it would be really helpful
if I could see that footage.

41:26.797 --> 41:31.093
I-I would ask the manager but it
seems you're the only one here

41:31.093 --> 41:32.928
who knows anything.

41:34.263 --> 41:36.348
You know what? When my show
is up and running,

41:36.348 --> 41:40.520
youshould come on it
as a special guest.

41:41.437 --> 41:43.773
-Really?
-Yeah.

41:50.613 --> 41:53.240
-When was this?
-Last month.

41:53.240 --> 41:55.409
Peter... I mean, Mr. Thompson

41:55.409 --> 41:58.747
was handling some financial
matters for Mr. Kelsey.

41:58.747 --> 42:00.956
-What kind?
-I don't know.

42:00.956 --> 42:05.169
[Tammy] Something
about a second location.

42:05.961 --> 42:07.338
Hm.

42:07.797 --> 42:09.882
I've never seen them
argue before.

42:09.882 --> 42:12.509
They were best friends.

42:12.509 --> 42:14.428
Detective Diggs saw this?

42:14.428 --> 42:16.180
Yep.

42:17.599 --> 42:18.974
[sighs]

42:20.976 --> 42:23.187
-Thanks.
-Yep. Any time.

42:23.187 --> 42:25.898
So, when am I gonna be
on your show?

42:25.898 --> 42:27.776
[chuckles]

42:30.820 --> 42:32.529
Hey, stranger.

42:32.529 --> 42:35.199
Brit, what are you doing here?

42:35.199 --> 42:36.367
You're my muse,

42:36.367 --> 42:40.079
and I'm hoping, my mentor?

42:40.079 --> 42:40.871
I, uh...

42:40.871 --> 42:42.539
Come on, we'd make such
a great team.

42:42.539 --> 42:46.586
I'm flattered, but someone is
trying to frame me for murder.

42:46.586 --> 42:50.381
Maybe even kill me. I've got the
gossip rags all over me.

42:50.381 --> 42:51.716
-So--
-That's the thing though.

42:51.716 --> 42:55.804
They think you're guilty.
I don't. I could help you.

42:55.804 --> 42:56.887
Just answer a few questions.

42:56.887 --> 43:00.474
Look, any second Detective Diggs
could slap some cuffs on me.

43:00.474 --> 43:01.517
I'm-I'm running out of time,

43:01.517 --> 43:04.687
and it seems like everyone
in this town has a secret.

43:04.687 --> 43:06.188
-Do you?
-What?

43:06.188 --> 43:08.190
-Have a secret?
-Of course not.

43:08.190 --> 43:11.527
The truth always comes out.
One way or another.

43:11.527 --> 43:13.655
Well, sure. I hope so.

43:13.655 --> 43:17.074
[dramatic music]

43:45.436 --> 43:46.813
[gasps]

43:47.312 --> 43:48.690
[sighs]

43:50.524 --> 43:52.609
-Hey! You okay?
-Ah!

43:52.609 --> 43:55.195
-You look freaked out.
-Uh, I, I don't know.

43:55.195 --> 43:58.825
I... I thought, uh...
I don't know what I thought.

43:58.825 --> 44:00.743
I saw you come out
of the office.

44:00.743 --> 44:03.078
Were you looking for me?

44:03.078 --> 44:04.455
Sort of.

44:05.456 --> 44:08.083
Okay, look. I don't know
what they told you.

44:08.083 --> 44:10.670
But... we've been friends
for a long time,

44:10.670 --> 44:13.505
and I deserve a chance
to explain myself.

44:15.466 --> 44:16.550
[sighs]

44:16.550 --> 44:18.218
Matt and I, we...

44:18.218 --> 44:23.348
Well, it's complicated.
I just, I need you to know

44:23.348 --> 44:26.310
that I had nothing
to do with those photos.

44:27.186 --> 44:29.021
The what?

44:30.732 --> 44:32.065
What's this?

44:32.065 --> 44:33.400
[Peter] Someone leaked
pictures of us

44:33.400 --> 44:37.070
to what seems like every news
site on earth.

44:37.529 --> 44:38.948
[sighs]

44:38.948 --> 44:40.783
[sighs] Okay. I have to go.

44:40.783 --> 44:43.619
Kate, please. Look,
I need the chance to explain

44:43.619 --> 44:46.038
what you saw at the firm.

44:50.960 --> 44:53.713
[breathing heavily]

44:54.588 --> 44:56.006
Lenore.

44:56.006 --> 44:58.425
Are you okay?
Did you run here?

44:58.425 --> 45:01.971
Did you see the photo?
It's innocent. I-I swear.

45:01.971 --> 45:04.306
Kate... Kate, breathe.

45:04.306 --> 45:06.851
I saw the picture
and immediately recognized

45:06.851 --> 45:09.520
from our couples' vacation
last year.

45:10.855 --> 45:14.776
Is this, is this illegal?
It-it feels illegal.

45:15.484 --> 45:17.946
Where did they get the photo?

45:17.946 --> 45:18.821
No idea.

45:18.821 --> 45:19.906
One of us get hacked?

45:19.906 --> 45:24.827
But, the thing is, is
I think Matt took that photo.

45:24.827 --> 45:27.997
So then, somebody
has Matt's phone.

45:27.997 --> 45:29.581
[phone rings]

45:31.041 --> 45:33.377
[pensive music]

45:33.920 --> 45:35.922
[Kate] Oh, my God!

45:36.255 --> 45:37.589
What?

45:37.589 --> 45:41.093
It's Matt... and Lisa.

45:41.093 --> 45:43.345
[music intensifies]

45:43.345 --> 45:45.597
These photos are
spreading everywhere.

45:45.597 --> 45:48.810
I'm gonna be a meme
in 20 minutes.

45:48.810 --> 45:50.727
[cup shattering]

45:54.523 --> 45:57.651
Hey, I hate that
this is happening to you.

45:57.651 --> 46:00.529
We're gonna find out
who did this.

46:00.529 --> 46:02.865
[Garrett]
What's the problem here?

46:03.740 --> 46:05.075
You look great.

46:05.075 --> 46:06.035
And Peter is hot!

46:06.035 --> 46:07.912
I don't know what
you're so pissed about.

46:07.912 --> 46:12.041
They're private photos
from Matt's phone.

46:12.041 --> 46:13.208
What can we do, legally?

46:13.208 --> 46:16.753
Oh, you can't sue the
whole internet.

46:17.254 --> 46:18.047
Oh, yikes!

46:18.047 --> 46:19.966
Looks like Matt and Lisa
were brewing up

46:19.966 --> 46:21.884
more than just pale ales.

46:21.884 --> 46:22.802
Okay, that is not funny.

46:22.802 --> 46:24.929
And she's the one that's
sending me those hate letters.

46:24.929 --> 46:28.975
Hm. Meanwhile,
Brit is gaining followers.

46:28.975 --> 46:31.727
You know, I bet
she's behind these leaks.

46:31.936 --> 46:32.769
Unless it's you.

46:32.769 --> 46:35.188
There's no such thing
as bad press.

46:35.188 --> 46:36.523
I would never!

46:36.523 --> 46:40.611
Like you said, it's probably
the little wannabe. Right?

46:40.777 --> 46:42.404
Did I tell you that
she ambushed me

46:42.404 --> 46:43.990
demanding that we work together?

46:43.990 --> 46:46.199
Well, there you go.

46:46.366 --> 46:49.411
Maybe you should take her up
on that offer.

46:49.411 --> 46:51.622
See what she knows.

46:51.622 --> 46:54.666
[mellow music]

47:04.886 --> 47:08.221
[intense music]

47:12.894 --> 47:14.353
Hello?

47:17.023 --> 47:18.482
Hello?

47:25.031 --> 47:26.698
[distant creaking]

47:29.618 --> 47:31.161
[switch clicks]

47:34.414 --> 47:38.086
[suspenseful music]

47:47.929 --> 47:49.304
[grunts]

47:51.306 --> 47:53.183
[water sloshing]

47:53.183 --> 47:55.394
[Lenore] I am working
the night shift.

47:55.394 --> 47:57.897
I just came home
for a quick shower.

47:58.230 --> 47:59.231
Didn't think you'd be here.

47:59.231 --> 48:02.068
Sorry, if you're trying
to avoid me.

48:03.069 --> 48:05.529
It's been a long day.

48:05.529 --> 48:07.698
[Peter] Yeah, for me, too.

48:07.698 --> 48:10.826
My work is stressful,
you've no idea.

48:11.160 --> 48:12.828
Peter, please.

48:13.537 --> 48:14.038
[sighs]

48:14.038 --> 48:18.000
Okay. Uh, can just go ahead
and finalize the separation?

48:18.000 --> 48:21.294
This limbo thing
is driving me crazy.

48:21.795 --> 48:24.966
It is not really right time,

48:24.966 --> 48:27.009
with everything going on.

48:28.218 --> 48:29.594
Yeah, of course,
you care more about

48:29.594 --> 48:31.847
how it looks than I how feel.

48:36.185 --> 48:36.768
Hey.

48:36.768 --> 48:38.980
I'm sorry,
I should've called first.

48:38.980 --> 48:42.441
But I just couldn't be
alone in the house.

48:42.441 --> 48:44.860
Figured we could do game night?

48:44.860 --> 48:46.278
I'm going for a run.

48:46.278 --> 48:48.363
I'll stick to my usual schedule
from now on.

48:48.363 --> 48:50.907
You can avoid me
if you want to.

48:54.996 --> 48:56.872
Well, you're welcome to stay
for a bit,

48:56.872 --> 49:00.001
but I'll have to go
to the station soon.

49:00.001 --> 49:04.088
We really don't have to...

49:04.088 --> 49:04.755
No.

49:04.755 --> 49:07.507
[inhales deeply] I want to.

49:21.105 --> 49:23.024
[Lenore sighs]

49:23.024 --> 49:24.108
[Kate chuckles]

49:24.108 --> 49:24.733
So, uh...

49:24.733 --> 49:28.904
do you wanna talk about
what I just walked in on?

49:28.904 --> 49:31.406
Are you and Peter okay?

49:32.365 --> 49:33.993
No.

49:34.493 --> 49:36.286
And, no.

49:39.331 --> 49:41.291
[phone ringing]

49:44.544 --> 49:46.296
Sergeant Thompson.

49:49.466 --> 49:51.052
At Mendaville?

49:51.968 --> 49:55.347
-What?
-[Lenore] Yeah. I'm on my way.

49:55.347 --> 49:57.474
I'll explain on the way.
Come on.

49:58.100 --> 50:00.727
-[Lenore] Sit back here?
-Okay.

50:01.229 --> 50:03.980
-Cause of death?
-What's she doing here?

50:03.980 --> 50:06.025
She owns the crime scene.

50:06.025 --> 50:08.236
What's the cause of death?

50:08.610 --> 50:12.489
Lisa was bludgeoned with
an unknown blunt object.

50:12.489 --> 50:14.200
Similar head wound,
length, depth.

50:14.200 --> 50:15.659
So, yeah, we can wait
for the crime lab

50:15.659 --> 50:17.119
to give us the report,
but my gut tells me

50:17.119 --> 50:20.872
it's gonna be the same murder
weapon used in Matt's death.

50:20.872 --> 50:22.833
Oh, shit!

50:23.625 --> 50:24.459
Do we have a time frame?

50:24.459 --> 50:26.295
Javier left her here alone
around 6:00 p.m.,

50:26.295 --> 50:28.421
weekend bartender came in
found her body.

50:28.421 --> 50:29.840
He was here to get
his paycheck.

50:29.840 --> 50:31.217
Her body is still warm upstairs!

50:31.217 --> 50:32.759
[Diggs] I missed something.
[Lenore] Hey.

50:32.759 --> 50:34.344
[Diggs]
And this is happening again.

50:34.344 --> 50:37.806
Keep it together.
You are a professional.

50:37.806 --> 50:40.934
And I need you
to solve this now...

50:41.185 --> 50:43.728
before someone else gets hurt.

50:44.855 --> 50:48.024
You mean killed, sarge?

50:48.024 --> 50:49.776
Before someone gets killed.

50:49.776 --> 50:53.197
[dramatic music]

50:58.952 --> 51:00.329
[grunts]

51:02.998 --> 51:04.833
Kate. Hey.

51:06.835 --> 51:08.378
Hey, Peter.

51:09.588 --> 51:11.215
How are you?

51:11.215 --> 51:13.508
Not sleeping so great. You?

51:13.675 --> 51:18.347
Same. Yeah, I guess I'm trying
to tire myself out.

51:18.555 --> 51:21.391
You said you wanted
to tell me the truth.

51:23.393 --> 51:24.436
Yeah.

51:24.436 --> 51:26.646
Ah, let's go get some tea.

51:33.403 --> 51:36.781
Diggs wants me to come in
for questioning later.

51:37.908 --> 51:38.408
Oh.

51:38.408 --> 51:41.578
[scoffs] I hate that
I'm a suspect.

51:42.078 --> 51:43.038
I would never hurt Matt.

51:43.038 --> 51:46.958
And I didn't even know
this Lisa woman.

51:48.543 --> 51:52.422
What were you and Matt
fighting about at the office?

51:54.133 --> 51:57.844
I used to have a gambling
problem in college.

51:57.844 --> 51:59.554
I outgrew it, straightened up.

51:59.554 --> 52:02.682
And then, a few years ago,
I started again.

52:02.682 --> 52:04.310
Little sports betting.

52:04.310 --> 52:07.355
It was harmless,
until I started losing.

52:07.938 --> 52:08.855
How much?

52:08.855 --> 52:12.318
I had a secret credit card,
and I maxed it out.

52:15.279 --> 52:17.281
Did Matt know this?

52:18.407 --> 52:20.201
He offered to help me
payoff my debt

52:20.201 --> 52:23.954
and kick the habit if I
introduced him at the office.

52:23.954 --> 52:25.080
He wanted to secure financing

52:25.080 --> 52:27.249
for Mendaville's
second location.

52:27.249 --> 52:29.042
[breathing deeply]

52:29.042 --> 52:31.044
Called in favors,
got my boss on board.

52:31.044 --> 52:35.840
And then a few weeks ago,
he swings by and says he's out.

52:35.840 --> 52:37.634
Just like that.

52:38.386 --> 52:40.221
I threatened him.

52:40.221 --> 52:42.306
I just felt used.

52:43.182 --> 52:45.309
He didn't want me
involved, either.

52:45.309 --> 52:49.230
Like, why would he go to you
when we have the money?

52:50.063 --> 52:52.233
Yeah, I don't know.

52:55.777 --> 52:57.028
What were you doing that night?

52:57.028 --> 53:01.450
You went for your run, and
you saw me leave, and then?

53:04.160 --> 53:06.455
I went to a poker game.

53:07.872 --> 53:08.623
[chuckles]

53:08.623 --> 53:10.459
I texted Matt before.
I was hoping

53:10.459 --> 53:13.044
that I could borrow
some money.

53:13.628 --> 53:15.297
He never replied.

53:15.588 --> 53:18.883
Thought I could win it all back,
and pay off the debt...

53:18.883 --> 53:21.011
make everything right.

53:21.928 --> 53:23.347
I lost, of course.

53:23.347 --> 53:26.850
Is this what you and Lenore
were fighting about?

53:27.934 --> 53:29.311
Yeah.

53:29.311 --> 53:31.896
She found my credit card
statement.

53:33.189 --> 53:36.277
Things between us have
not been good.

53:36.818 --> 53:39.447
[breathing deeply]

53:43.492 --> 53:45.577
Everything is gonna be okay.

53:45.577 --> 53:49.248
I'll-I'll help you in
anyway that I can.

53:49.248 --> 53:52.584
But, you need to go
and talk to a therapist.

53:52.584 --> 53:55.296
And no more gambling.

53:58.048 --> 54:00.091
Thanks, Kate.

54:02.344 --> 54:03.720
Hey.

54:04.721 --> 54:06.097
What are you doing here, Kate?

54:06.097 --> 54:10.018
Uh, we were just talking
about yesterday.

54:10.018 --> 54:13.021
-Hm.
-About everything.

54:13.021 --> 54:14.440
Hm.

54:16.066 --> 54:17.485
Yeah.

54:21.821 --> 54:23.407
Okay. Um, I am-I am...

54:23.407 --> 54:26.993
I'm gonna give you guys
a minute.

54:32.999 --> 54:36.044
Diggs is expecting you
at the station.

54:36.420 --> 54:39.005
Maybe I should get a lawyer.

54:40.424 --> 54:43.344
Well, just don't lie
to the police,

54:43.344 --> 54:44.345
and I'm sure you'll be fine.

54:44.345 --> 54:46.888
[Peter] It's nice to have you
give a damn about me

54:46.888 --> 54:47.847
for a change, Lenore.

54:47.847 --> 54:49.891
Peter, please,
don't start this again.

54:49.891 --> 54:53.479
I'm under enough pressure
at the station.

55:00.819 --> 55:02.363
[door opens]

55:02.695 --> 55:06.074
-Kate, hey. Thanks for coming.
-Hey.

55:06.074 --> 55:08.910
Um, isn't this still
a crime scene?

55:08.910 --> 55:09.953
Should, should we be here?

55:09.953 --> 55:11.746
Oh, uh,
the back room is taped off.

55:11.746 --> 55:13.665
Plus, no one was murdered
out here, they said

55:13.665 --> 55:15.334
we can reopen
in a couple of days.

55:15.334 --> 55:16.292
-Oh.
-Sit, sit.

55:16.292 --> 55:19.754
[Javier] I have some small batch
whiskeys I want you to try.

55:20.171 --> 55:23.425
Of course, I want to honor
Matt's vision for Mendaville,

55:23.425 --> 55:27.303
but it doesn't mean we can't
update a little bit, right?

55:27.471 --> 55:29.013
Um, I guess.

55:29.013 --> 55:31.724
But doesn't it feel a bit soon?

55:31.933 --> 55:36.355
Um... I don't want
to sound insensitive.

55:36.355 --> 55:37.689
But I can't help but feel

55:37.689 --> 55:40.108
that this is the moment
I've been waiting for.

55:40.108 --> 55:42.193
You know, I...
I have everything we need

55:42.193 --> 55:43.903
to take Mendaville
to the next level.

55:43.903 --> 55:46.281
-Hm.
-I'm ready, Kate.

55:46.281 --> 55:48.783
-You can trust me.
-Hm.

55:49.117 --> 55:53.830
Matt had no vision,
no drive to expand.

55:54.540 --> 55:57.333
Uh, why do you say that?

55:58.251 --> 56:00.128
Well, 'cause he was content
to stay here.

56:00.128 --> 56:04.007
I mean, he's been jerking those
VC guys around for months.

56:05.049 --> 56:08.303
So, you were mad at Matt?

56:08.303 --> 56:12.724
Sure, I mean,
I saw the way he treated Lisa.

56:13.683 --> 56:15.810
He wasn't a good guy.

56:19.440 --> 56:21.567
Um... Look, Javier.

56:21.567 --> 56:25.904
I, I know you are
a savvy businessman.

56:25.904 --> 56:27.406
But, um, I just don't know

56:27.406 --> 56:29.533
if it's the right time
to make big moves

56:29.533 --> 56:30.325
for the business.

56:30.325 --> 56:33.953
So, why don't we let
the investigation wrap up

56:33.953 --> 56:37.165
and then... then we can talk?

56:37.666 --> 56:39.834
No, I'm not gonna be cut out...

56:40.919 --> 56:42.463
left behind.

56:45.006 --> 56:46.592
Sign this!

56:47.635 --> 56:49.511
[intense music]

56:49.511 --> 56:51.846
-Now!
-Oh.

56:51.846 --> 56:53.973
"A transfer of
business ownership?"

56:53.973 --> 56:56.184
I... No. No, I-I...

56:56.184 --> 56:58.353
-I have to speak to Garrett.
-Don't be stupid.

56:58.353 --> 57:01.105
Don't be stupid, Kate.
We know how much you resented,

57:01.105 --> 57:02.148
how much time Matt spent here.

57:02.148 --> 57:05.569
Just sign the papers,
and be done with it once...

57:07.320 --> 57:09.155
I'm not gonna hurt you, Kate.

57:09.155 --> 57:11.074
Or maybe I'm the one
who should be afraid.

57:11.074 --> 57:15.621
Your husband's dead.
His girlfriend, dead.

57:16.412 --> 57:17.498
Huh!

57:17.498 --> 57:20.416
I'm one of the only friends
you have left.

57:22.085 --> 57:24.295
Police! Don't move!

57:25.631 --> 57:28.049
She pulls a knife on me and I'm
the one going to the station?

57:28.049 --> 57:32.762
Just a quick chat. Don't make me
regret not using cuffs.

57:33.012 --> 57:35.516
Smart move, calling Lenore.

57:35.974 --> 57:37.559
[sighs] Yeah.

57:38.101 --> 57:39.978
Um... Tsk.

57:39.978 --> 57:42.021
I've, uh, I've got
another scoop

57:42.021 --> 57:44.065
that I think
you'll find useful.

57:44.065 --> 57:49.362
But, you've got to tell me
about you and Lenore.

57:53.283 --> 57:54.409
Fine.

57:54.409 --> 57:56.745
Okay. Um...

57:56.745 --> 57:58.664
I talked to Peter,
and he told me

57:58.664 --> 58:02.501
that his gambling landed him
in hot water with Lenore.

58:02.501 --> 58:06.462
And I walked in on them...

58:06.796 --> 58:09.465
talking about getting a divorce.

58:12.761 --> 58:14.178
So...

58:14.887 --> 58:17.558
I-I told you what I know.

58:19.267 --> 58:20.268
You and Lenore...

58:20.268 --> 58:22.604
You guys were partners, right?

58:22.604 --> 58:25.649
She never talked to you
about this?

58:25.649 --> 58:27.025
No.

58:27.693 --> 58:29.152
Okay.

58:30.069 --> 58:32.864
Last year,
we catch a homicide.

58:32.864 --> 58:36.409
Now, there was some problem
submitting the evidence.

58:36.409 --> 58:38.286
There was a little mistake.

58:38.286 --> 58:41.749
Thing is, the guy gets off
on a technicality...

58:41.749 --> 58:43.916
they call a police error.

58:45.669 --> 58:47.962
He goes out and he kills again.

58:47.962 --> 58:48.797
Hm.

58:48.797 --> 58:51.550
She and I were partners,
but it was my signature

58:51.550 --> 58:53.719
on the botched report.

58:54.135 --> 58:56.471
I get leave with no pay...

58:58.724 --> 59:01.810
she gets my promotion
to sergeant.

59:03.604 --> 59:04.979
Oh.

59:08.316 --> 59:09.859
So, uh...

59:10.401 --> 59:12.571
you got something to prove.

59:13.946 --> 59:15.239
You can't mess this up.

59:15.239 --> 59:18.577
-[sighing] Hmm.
-Hm.

59:18.577 --> 59:21.204
This is bullshit. I was just
trying to talk to her.

59:21.204 --> 59:23.456
Oh, a pro tip,
women don't feel threatened

59:23.456 --> 59:25.958
by guys who just want to talk.

59:26.125 --> 59:29.045
I don't think you guys are
gonna solve this thing.

59:29.755 --> 59:31.799
Is that right?

59:31.799 --> 59:33.341
This town...

59:33.925 --> 59:35.426
everybody's got a secret...

59:35.426 --> 59:36.886
everybody's trying to cover
their own ass.

59:36.886 --> 59:38.471
I mean, how are the police's
supposed to find out

59:38.471 --> 59:40.849
who killed Matt when, when they
don't know the whole story?

59:40.849 --> 59:43.727
They can't see
the complete picture?

59:43.727 --> 59:45.978
What's your secret?

59:49.817 --> 59:50.734
[sighs]

59:50.734 --> 59:52.527
Lisa and I, um...

59:53.277 --> 59:54.278
We used to date.

59:54.278 --> 59:56.572
And then she became
so obsessed with Mendaville

59:56.572 --> 59:58.116
and getting a promotion...

59:58.116 --> 1:00:01.994
Once Matt started flirting
with her, she-she dumped me.

1:00:01.994 --> 1:00:05.998
We used to dream about running
the brewery together.

1:00:07.250 --> 1:00:09.961
Honestly, she changed
so much when Matt died.

1:00:09.961 --> 1:00:12.714
I thought maybe
Lisa had done it.

1:00:14.590 --> 1:00:15.967
And now?

1:00:16.175 --> 1:00:18.804
Any idea who might have
killed Matt?

1:00:20.263 --> 1:00:22.766
I told you my secret.

1:00:22.766 --> 1:00:23.474
What's yours?

1:00:23.474 --> 1:00:27.771
I know you never trusted me,
and you were right not to.

1:00:27.771 --> 1:00:30.398
I guess, I had motive.

1:00:31.775 --> 1:00:34.653
Anger, revenge.

1:00:36.070 --> 1:00:37.572
But, uh...

1:00:39.323 --> 1:00:42.368
I loved Matt.

1:00:42.870 --> 1:00:44.954
And I didn't kill him.

1:00:45.873 --> 1:00:48.166
Please believe me.

1:00:50.001 --> 1:00:51.712
[knocking on window]

1:00:52.170 --> 1:00:54.088
What do you think about her?
She's always

1:00:54.088 --> 1:00:55.799
popping at crime scenes.

1:00:55.799 --> 1:00:59.594
-So are you, Kate.
-Yeah, but I have an alibi.

1:01:05.558 --> 1:01:07.059
Hey. You are not posting
that video.

1:01:07.059 --> 1:01:11.397
My fans expect content.
You know what it's like.

1:01:11.397 --> 1:01:12.064
This is my life.

1:01:12.064 --> 1:01:14.902
My-my entire reputation,
my freedom is on the line.

1:01:14.902 --> 1:01:17.069
I've been watching your videos
since high school.

1:01:17.069 --> 1:01:20.031
Your videos are what inspired me
to go into journalism.

1:01:20.031 --> 1:01:22.033
And now that I have my
own big scoop,

1:01:22.033 --> 1:01:24.494
you want me to just... drop it?

1:01:24.494 --> 1:01:27.079
You got hustle,
I'll give you that.

1:01:27.956 --> 1:01:29.040
You, um...

1:01:29.040 --> 1:01:32.001
You remind me of me
when I just started.

1:01:32.878 --> 1:01:34.670
Look, if you delete that video,

1:01:34.670 --> 1:01:38.257
we can work together
on something bigger.

1:01:39.550 --> 1:01:40.676
-Really?
-Yeah. You're tenacious.

1:01:40.676 --> 1:01:43.722
You're smart. Why wouldn't
I wanna work with you?

1:01:43.722 --> 1:01:45.849
Oh, my God, Kate!

1:01:45.849 --> 1:01:46.725
I won't let you down.

1:01:46.725 --> 1:01:50.686
But you have to tell me
everything that you know.

1:01:51.187 --> 1:01:53.523
It's time to come clean.

1:01:58.946 --> 1:02:00.488
[exhales deeply]

1:02:02.866 --> 1:02:04.367
That's-that's Matt's phone.

1:02:04.367 --> 1:02:07.662
It's not what it looks like.
I-I found it.

1:02:07.913 --> 1:02:10.540
I was looking through the house
after the police left

1:02:10.540 --> 1:02:12.500
and I found it in the garden.

1:02:12.500 --> 1:02:14.252
I was gonna turn it in
to the cops,

1:02:14.252 --> 1:02:16.629
but then I found your photos,

1:02:16.629 --> 1:02:18.714
of you and Peter.

1:02:19.382 --> 1:02:23.511
So, you leaked them
to the press.

1:02:27.139 --> 1:02:29.768
Where were you the night
that Matt died?

1:02:29.977 --> 1:02:31.477
I was working overnight
at the station.

1:02:31.477 --> 1:02:35.816
7:00 to 7:00. I was still there
when you had your interview.

1:02:40.069 --> 1:02:41.029
Okay. Okay, fine.

1:02:41.029 --> 1:02:43.197
But you turn up
everywhere that I go.

1:02:43.197 --> 1:02:44.950
How is that possible?
It's like...

1:02:44.950 --> 1:02:47.786
It's like someone
is helping you.

1:02:48.912 --> 1:02:52.290
Now that you're my mentor,
I have to admit.

1:02:52.665 --> 1:02:55.209
I've had an inside man.

1:02:55.209 --> 1:02:56.711
[chuckles]

1:02:58.046 --> 1:02:59.171
[sighs]

1:02:59.171 --> 1:03:02.091
Yes, fine. It was me.

1:03:02.091 --> 1:03:04.594
-Why?
-It's a 24-hour news cycle.

1:03:04.594 --> 1:03:06.304
People were starting
to lose interest.

1:03:06.304 --> 1:03:09.473
I needed to do something
to stir you into action.

1:03:09.473 --> 1:03:11.935
Brit was an easy mark.

1:03:11.935 --> 1:03:13.311
Thank you.

1:03:13.311 --> 1:03:15.104
Okay, can we stay
focused here, please?

1:03:15.104 --> 1:03:18.900
Look, I'm sorry I fed Brit
info about your whereabouts.

1:03:18.900 --> 1:03:20.735
Okay? I'm sorry.

1:03:20.735 --> 1:03:21.485
I'm sorry.

1:03:21.485 --> 1:03:24.196
You're lucky that I have Diggs
finally on my side,

1:03:24.196 --> 1:03:27.450
and Javier is on the top
of the suspects list.

1:03:27.450 --> 1:03:28.451
He had the most to gain now that

1:03:28.451 --> 1:03:30.954
Lisa and Matt
are out of the picture.

1:03:30.954 --> 1:03:33.164
It could be someone else.

1:03:33.164 --> 1:03:35.791
A random killer, a-a stalker.

1:03:35.791 --> 1:03:38.711
No, it's always the least
likely suspect.

1:03:38.711 --> 1:03:39.880
Do you ever watch my shows?

1:03:39.880 --> 1:03:43.091
It's always the
mostlikely suspect.

1:03:44.759 --> 1:03:46.677
[sighs]

1:03:53.060 --> 1:03:54.853
Do we have a meeting?

1:03:54.853 --> 1:03:58.814
[sighs] Did you get any leads
from Javier?

1:03:59.190 --> 1:04:01.860
Uh, he's being questioned now.

1:04:01.860 --> 1:04:03.277
He says that
we're not gonna solve this

1:04:03.277 --> 1:04:05.030
'cause no one's telling
the truth...

1:04:05.030 --> 1:04:07.740
that we can't see
the full picture.

1:04:07.740 --> 1:04:09.533
So, he is our prime suspect
right now,

1:04:09.533 --> 1:04:13.121
but we do have a
new suspect at play.

1:04:13.704 --> 1:04:15.082
Who?

1:04:17.918 --> 1:04:20.336
You told me
that you were on shift

1:04:20.336 --> 1:04:22.964
the night that
Matt was murdered.

1:04:24.091 --> 1:04:27.510
But I pulled the logs,
and you're not on them.

1:04:28.386 --> 1:04:31.555
You told me you were here,
but you weren't.

1:04:33.182 --> 1:04:34.558
I lied.

1:04:39.772 --> 1:04:41.942
[phone ringing]

1:04:43.651 --> 1:04:45.528
It's Peter.

1:04:45.528 --> 1:04:46.947
No.

1:04:46.947 --> 1:04:47.446
Hey.

1:04:47.446 --> 1:04:49.782
-[Peter]Where are you?
-Uh, I'm at Garrett's. Why?

1:04:49.782 --> 1:04:51.492
[Peter]Lenore forgot her lunch,
so I'm at the station,

1:04:51.492 --> 1:04:55.038
I just overheard, I think
they're going to arrest you.

1:04:55.038 --> 1:04:56.288
-What?
-[Peter]Yeah.

1:04:56.288 --> 1:04:57.748
Apparently,
there's new evidence.

1:04:57.748 --> 1:04:59.918
-What did they find?
-[Peter]I don't know.

1:04:59.918 --> 1:05:03.130
But... but you're innocent,
right?

1:05:03.130 --> 1:05:05.548
Maybe you should just go.

1:05:06.298 --> 1:05:07.550
Get on a plane or...

1:05:07.550 --> 1:05:08.634
I don't know.

1:05:08.634 --> 1:05:10.886
I could help you,
if you wanted me to.

1:05:10.886 --> 1:05:12.304
No, I-I-I can't run away now.

1:05:12.304 --> 1:05:15.474
Not when I'm so close
to solving this. I...

1:05:16.350 --> 1:05:18.811
I care about you, Kate.

1:05:21.522 --> 1:05:24.316
Stay there. I've got a plan.

1:05:25.986 --> 1:05:28.071
Brit, let's go.

1:05:29.197 --> 1:05:30.698
Just Brit.

1:05:32.033 --> 1:05:33.617
That's fine.

1:05:33.617 --> 1:05:37.164
[tense music]

1:05:49.842 --> 1:05:53.138
Okay, Lenore is gone.
Where are you?

1:05:53.138 --> 1:05:54.638
[whispers] Bull pen.

1:05:54.638 --> 1:05:57.017
-Hi.
-[Kate]Walk with confidence.

1:05:57.017 --> 1:05:58.684
And don't make eye contact.

1:05:58.684 --> 1:06:01.104
[Peter]Her office is straight,
and to the left.

1:06:01.104 --> 1:06:03.023
Her name is on the door.

1:06:03.023 --> 1:06:05.025
I see it.

1:06:13.365 --> 1:06:14.034
Lock screen!

1:06:14.034 --> 1:06:15.618
[Peter]Open the lower
right desk drawer.

1:06:15.618 --> 1:06:17.870
There should be a list of
passwords in there.

1:06:17.870 --> 1:06:19.955
She can never remember hers.

1:06:19.955 --> 1:06:21.332
Got it.

1:06:24.335 --> 1:06:27.630
[Kate]Look for the digital
evidence file.

1:06:27.630 --> 1:06:30.549
I-I need to know
what they have on me.

1:06:30.549 --> 1:06:33.220
Some photos.

1:06:33.220 --> 1:06:37.306
CCTV footage from
Garrett's building.

1:06:37.306 --> 1:06:40.392
Witness statements from Peter...

1:06:40.392 --> 1:06:41.936
Javier...

1:06:43.604 --> 1:06:45.148
and Lenore.

1:06:48.943 --> 1:06:51.821
Lenore gave a witness statement?

1:06:51.821 --> 1:06:52.613
Send it.

1:06:52.613 --> 1:06:56.201
[suspenseful music]

1:07:13.093 --> 1:07:14.052
Oh.

1:07:14.052 --> 1:07:15.803
Wow, I, uh...

1:07:16.470 --> 1:07:20.015
This must've been
going on for...

1:07:20.015 --> 1:07:21.684
Lenore and Matt?

1:07:21.684 --> 1:07:23.352
According to this,
they've been

1:07:23.352 --> 1:07:26.647
having an affair
for three years.

1:07:30.818 --> 1:07:33.863
I thought it was my gambling
that was pulling us apart,

1:07:33.863 --> 1:07:35.323
but it was here.

1:07:35.323 --> 1:07:37.449
She's a cheater.

1:07:41.620 --> 1:07:44.082
What a twist!

1:07:44.082 --> 1:07:46.500
Our show is gonna be huge.

1:07:46.959 --> 1:07:49.879
Don't you realize
what this means?

1:07:51.172 --> 1:07:52.798
What?

1:07:53.591 --> 1:07:56.136
Lenore killed Matt.

1:07:59.889 --> 1:08:01.308
[sighs]

1:08:02.142 --> 1:08:05.145
[pensive music]

1:08:10.275 --> 1:08:13.819
[mellow music]

1:08:24.455 --> 1:08:26.415
[phone ringing]

1:08:33.131 --> 1:08:35.300
[Kate]I know about you
and Matt.

1:08:35.300 --> 1:08:38.052
I'm surprised
it took this long.

1:08:38.052 --> 1:08:40.221
We weren't always careful.

1:08:40.221 --> 1:08:43.057
I think it's time
we have a talk.

1:08:44.184 --> 1:08:46.353
Where are you?

1:08:46.353 --> 1:08:48.687
At home, in my studio.

1:08:49.272 --> 1:08:51.523
I'll be right there.

1:08:52.150 --> 1:08:54.109
[tense music]

1:08:54.109 --> 1:08:56.321
[both sighing]

1:09:00.449 --> 1:09:02.952
[exhales deeply]

1:09:21.762 --> 1:09:24.890
[music continues]

1:09:35.067 --> 1:09:36.151
You must think I'm an idiot.

1:09:36.151 --> 1:09:40.489
You record me and then edit
this any way you want?

1:09:44.034 --> 1:09:46.246
[Kate] They're not on.

1:09:47.162 --> 1:09:49.207
But this is an interview?

1:09:53.420 --> 1:09:55.380
[inhales deeply]

1:09:58.173 --> 1:09:59.174
[sighs]

1:09:59.174 --> 1:10:01.093
[suspenseful music]

1:10:02.011 --> 1:10:05.014
Did you ever have sex
in my bed?

1:10:06.098 --> 1:10:07.516
Kate, come on.

1:10:07.516 --> 1:10:10.644
[Kate] No, I should clarify.
Did you ever have sex

1:10:10.644 --> 1:10:14.648
with my dead husband
in my bed?

1:10:18.110 --> 1:10:20.863
We only ever met at the bar.

1:10:25.410 --> 1:10:28.662
So, it was your trunk
of toys I found.

1:10:28.662 --> 1:10:33.251
And here, I thought Matt and
I had an exciting sex life.

1:10:36.086 --> 1:10:41.675
Matt and I were two lonely
people in unhappy marriages.

1:10:45.054 --> 1:10:48.182
I never wanted to hurt you.

1:10:48.682 --> 1:10:51.311
You're my best friend.

1:10:51.311 --> 1:10:52.811
I just...

1:10:53.812 --> 1:10:57.107
I fell in love
with the wrong man.

1:11:03.406 --> 1:11:05.325
That trip to Aspen...

1:11:05.325 --> 1:11:07.285
you and Peter wanted
to shop and ski,

1:11:07.285 --> 1:11:10.371
and that left me alone
with Matt.

1:11:10.913 --> 1:11:15.335
We thought it would
be a one time thing,

1:11:15.335 --> 1:11:17.378
just on vacation.

1:11:17.545 --> 1:11:20.548
And that we'd come back home
and everything would

1:11:20.548 --> 1:11:22.716
go back to normal.

1:11:24.511 --> 1:11:26.595
But it didn't.

1:11:36.188 --> 1:11:38.483
Why did you kill him?

1:11:41.819 --> 1:11:43.237
What?

1:11:44.154 --> 1:11:47.616
Was it because you realized that
he was never gonna leave me?

1:11:47.616 --> 1:11:48.826
Or that he was screwing
Lisa, too,

1:11:48.826 --> 1:11:52.204
so you, so you bashed in
his brain and then hers or...?

1:11:52.204 --> 1:11:54.248
[Kate] Or did you want me
out of the way?

1:11:54.248 --> 1:11:55.082
Were you coming for me?

1:11:55.082 --> 1:11:59.002
And then, I was in the city
so I messed up your plans,

1:11:59.002 --> 1:12:01.339
and so you decided to frame me.

1:12:03.341 --> 1:12:04.967
Ah...

1:12:05.217 --> 1:12:08.637
You say you spent that night
at Garrett's house that night,

1:12:08.637 --> 1:12:13.142
and, yes, there is CCTV footage
of you arriving.

1:12:13.142 --> 1:12:15.936
But there's a back door
that doesn't have a camera.

1:12:15.936 --> 1:12:20.023
And you could have snuck out
without anybody knowing.

1:12:20.774 --> 1:12:22.276
Okay, so because
Garrett's too cheap

1:12:22.276 --> 1:12:25.446
to put in more cameras,
I'm a murderer?

1:12:25.446 --> 1:12:30.493
I came here because I thought
you were ready to confess.

1:12:30.493 --> 1:12:33.912
Why would I confess
when you're the killer?

1:12:38.292 --> 1:12:40.669
Notice those lights
over by your house?

1:12:40.669 --> 1:12:43.005
I-I wonder what
they're doing there?

1:12:43.005 --> 1:12:45.215
I wonder what they'll find?

1:12:48.636 --> 1:12:50.012
Kate...

1:12:51.180 --> 1:12:53.391
-What did you do?
-[Kate] Oh.

1:12:53.391 --> 1:12:55.684
No, you're, you're off duty.

1:12:55.684 --> 1:12:59.062
You never carry your gun
when you're off duty.

1:12:59.606 --> 1:13:01.315
What were you gonna do?
Were you going to shoot me,

1:13:01.315 --> 1:13:04.818
and try to, try to pretend
it was an accident?

1:13:05.068 --> 1:13:07.988
You're hoping
I'll incriminate myself...

1:13:07.988 --> 1:13:10.199
agree with one of your
wild accusations.

1:13:10.199 --> 1:13:12.326
But I'm a cop,
and I know how justice works.

1:13:12.326 --> 1:13:16.830
[chuckles] A home-wrecker,
with moral righteousness.

1:13:16.830 --> 1:13:22.420
Well, I bet right now
Brit's livestream viewers...

1:13:22.711 --> 1:13:25.797
they think you're
pretty damn guilty.

1:13:27.341 --> 1:13:30.844
[intense music]

1:13:35.349 --> 1:13:36.934
Oh, she did it.

1:13:37.602 --> 1:13:39.646
[indistinct radio chatter]

1:13:39.646 --> 1:13:44.191
[Lenore]You say you spent the
night at Garret's house...

1:13:44.191 --> 1:13:47.903
-We found something.
-Oh, my God.

1:13:48.237 --> 1:13:51.616
-Where did that come from?
-Where's your wife?

1:13:51.616 --> 1:13:53.825
[indistinct chatter]

1:13:53.825 --> 1:13:55.578
I think they're at Kate's.

1:13:55.578 --> 1:13:56.912
[indistinct chatter]

1:13:56.912 --> 1:13:58.665
[Diggs] What the hell
is she doing?

1:13:58.665 --> 1:14:01.959
[indistinct chatter]

1:14:06.838 --> 1:14:08.257
Pick up, Lenore.

1:14:08.257 --> 1:14:08.924
[phone ringing]

1:14:08.924 --> 1:14:12.094
-You did it.
-Somebody help!

1:14:12.094 --> 1:14:13.804
I have to arrest you!

1:14:13.804 --> 1:14:15.847
[grunting]

1:14:15.847 --> 1:14:17.891
You're a murderer!

1:14:17.891 --> 1:14:19.434
[Lenore groans]

1:14:20.018 --> 1:14:23.523
-You're crazy!
-No, Kate, I'm not!

1:14:23.523 --> 1:14:26.900
[grunting]

1:14:29.487 --> 1:14:30.862
[thuds]

1:14:31.238 --> 1:14:32.948
Run, Kate, run!

1:14:33.533 --> 1:14:37.953
You're interfering with the
arrest of a murder suspect.

1:14:40.163 --> 1:14:41.666
[phone rings]

1:14:41.666 --> 1:14:44.669
-Diggs, it's Kate.
-[Brit] Don't believe her!

1:14:44.669 --> 1:14:46.295
She did it!
She's on the run.

1:14:46.295 --> 1:14:49.507
Lenore, stay where you are.
I'm on my way.

1:14:49.507 --> 1:14:53.010
[intense music]

1:14:55.012 --> 1:14:56.388
[grunts]

1:15:01.602 --> 1:15:05.397
Come on, Kate.
There's nowhere to go.

1:15:08.859 --> 1:15:11.654
This doesn't have to end badly.

1:15:11.654 --> 1:15:13.656
Stay away from me!

1:15:14.323 --> 1:15:16.867
Come on, Kate, please.

1:15:16.867 --> 1:15:20.329
Just come to the
station with me.

1:15:24.709 --> 1:15:28.503
[sighs] Come on, don't make me
come up there.

1:15:31.173 --> 1:15:32.550
[sighs]

1:15:39.973 --> 1:15:41.475
[screams]

1:15:42.392 --> 1:15:44.812
[Kate] Lenore! Oh, my God.

1:15:44.812 --> 1:15:47.732
Help! Help! Lenore!

1:15:47.732 --> 1:15:49.900
Help! We're in here!

1:15:49.900 --> 1:15:50.942
Lenore?

1:15:50.942 --> 1:15:53.070
Help! We're in here!

1:15:56.824 --> 1:15:59.534
Lenore! Lenore!
Kate, what happened?

1:15:59.534 --> 1:16:03.831
-She-she fell.
-Back up, don't touch her.

1:16:07.501 --> 1:16:09.587
This is Officer Diggs.
I'm in the barn.

1:16:09.587 --> 1:16:13.048
Officer down!
Officer down!

1:16:13.340 --> 1:16:16.844
[dramatic music]

1:16:18.970 --> 1:16:20.765
All vitals absent.

1:16:21.431 --> 1:16:24.935
[dramatic music]

1:16:29.106 --> 1:16:31.609
[birds chirping]

1:16:32.567 --> 1:16:34.152
[lock clicks]

1:16:37.364 --> 1:16:40.075
-[Brit] Hey.
-Hey.

1:16:40.075 --> 1:16:42.745
-Do you need help?
-I'm good.

1:16:42.994 --> 1:16:45.205
-So, a few things.
-Mm-hm.

1:16:45.205 --> 1:16:46.164
Garrett wants a meeting to

1:16:46.164 --> 1:16:47.582
discuss your
new development deal.

1:16:47.582 --> 1:16:50.795
He's asking for more money
and creative freedom.

1:16:50.795 --> 1:16:53.338
-So I'll set that for tomorrow?
-Hm.

1:16:53.631 --> 1:16:56.216
Okay. And Javier called again.

1:16:56.216 --> 1:16:59.094
About his Mendaville
buyout offer.

1:16:59.094 --> 1:17:02.931
-Let's let him sweat a bit.
-Hm. Ahem.

1:17:02.931 --> 1:17:05.100
And finally,
did you get a chance

1:17:05.100 --> 1:17:07.936
to review my notes
on our new podcast?

1:17:07.936 --> 1:17:10.605
[Kate] Yes. They are great.

1:17:10.605 --> 1:17:12.357
Let's talk about it
this afternoon

1:17:12.357 --> 1:17:13.316
when I'm done recording.

1:17:13.316 --> 1:17:15.695
-Perfect. Yeah.
-Okay.

1:17:17.195 --> 1:17:18.572
Perfect.

1:17:20.532 --> 1:17:24.161
Now, I know this is
"Good Wife's Guide to Murder."

1:17:24.161 --> 1:17:26.955
But I'm thinking
about of a title change.

1:17:26.955 --> 1:17:30.918
I, I want to honor
what happened to Matt.

1:17:31.168 --> 1:17:33.253
And to me.

1:17:34.379 --> 1:17:37.466
[scoffs] My best friend
betrayed me.

1:17:37.466 --> 1:17:40.510
She slept with my husband,
she killed him,

1:17:40.510 --> 1:17:44.097
and then used her knowledge
of my Top Ten rules

1:17:44.097 --> 1:17:45.974
to try to frame me.

1:17:48.018 --> 1:17:49.561
Rule one...

1:17:49.812 --> 1:17:50.938
make a plan.

1:17:50.938 --> 1:17:54.107
[suspenseful music]

1:17:58.445 --> 1:18:01.699
Appearances are everything.

1:18:03.575 --> 1:18:05.912
Wait for the right opportunity.

1:18:08.497 --> 1:18:11.291
Hide the murder weapon.

1:18:19.674 --> 1:18:21.009
Solidify an alibi.

1:18:21.009 --> 1:18:24.137
[music continues]

1:18:46.493 --> 1:18:47.870
[thuds]

1:18:48.370 --> 1:18:50.080
[thudding]

1:18:51.331 --> 1:18:53.124
Patience is a virtue.

1:18:53.124 --> 1:18:56.879
Let the inevitable
investigation unfold.

1:18:57.587 --> 1:19:02.634
Work with the police for
as long as it benefits you.

1:19:03.718 --> 1:19:05.888
Get a lawyer.

1:19:07.765 --> 1:19:10.058
Keep your friends close.

1:19:10.977 --> 1:19:12.602
Control the narrative.

1:19:12.602 --> 1:19:16.231
[music continues]

1:19:23.655 --> 1:19:28.618
Now, there may be one or two
wildcards that you don't expect.

1:19:28.618 --> 1:19:29.286
But...

1:19:29.286 --> 1:19:31.998
chaos can be helpful.

1:19:32.455 --> 1:19:36.084
[music continues]

1:19:45.510 --> 1:19:46.469
-Sergeant Diggs.
-Yes?

1:19:46.469 --> 1:19:51.141
Got back the autopsy on
Sergeant Thompson, uh, Lenore.

1:19:52.559 --> 1:19:54.352
-Anything unusual?
-[woman 1] Not really.

1:19:54.352 --> 1:19:57.815
Acute subdural hematoma that's
consistent with her injury.

1:19:57.815 --> 1:20:00.525
But she also had a cranial
fracture that's weird,

1:20:00.525 --> 1:20:03.695
considering she fell on the back
of her head.

1:20:04.529 --> 1:20:06.489
Thank you.

1:20:14.623 --> 1:20:18.126
[dramatic music]

1:20:26.176 --> 1:20:27.053
[grunts]

1:20:27.053 --> 1:20:28.595
[Lenore screams]

1:20:30.138 --> 1:20:32.432
Help! Help! We're in here!

1:20:32.432 --> 1:20:35.644
And, one extra rule
that I'm not sure

1:20:35.644 --> 1:20:36.519
if I'll ever share

1:20:36.519 --> 1:20:41.358
is there's always
a better suspect out there.

1:20:42.275 --> 1:20:43.861
So find them.

1:20:44.028 --> 1:20:46.488
Let's face it.
No one's really interested

1:20:46.488 --> 1:20:49.116
in a "Good Wife's Guide
to Murder."

1:20:49.116 --> 1:20:53.620
What we want is a
"Good Wife's Guide to Murder,

1:20:53.620 --> 1:20:56.082
And How to Get Away With It."

1:20:57.041 --> 1:20:57.540
Tsk.

1:20:57.540 --> 1:21:00.502
I'm Kate K.,
and that's all for this week

1:21:00.502 --> 1:21:02.712
in "Murder And Marriage."

1:21:03.713 --> 1:21:05.465
Slay safe.

1:21:07.592 --> 1:21:08.969
[sighs]

1:21:09.511 --> 1:21:13.015
[dramatic music]

1:21:39.290 --> 1:21:43.045
[music continues]

1:21:47.674 --> 1:21:51.469
[suspenseful music]

1:22:17.746 --> 1:22:21.499
[music continues]

1:22:37.766 --> 1:22:41.519
[music continues]

1:23:07.796 --> 1:23:11.549
[music continues]

1:24:07.981 --> 1:24:11.609
