03:57.580 --> 04:01.040
Tobias, do you want water? No thanks.

04:47.120 --> 04:49.870
The plane is technically okay.

04:49.950 --> 04:53.790
A tire has a small crack, which you will have to change tonight, okay?

04:53.870 --> 04:55.160
Is good.

05:29.250 --> 05:31.910
I'll be outside for a moment. OK.

05:39.870 --> 05:41.250
Sweetheart!

05:42.540 --> 05:44.750
Hey Hey My mother wrote.

05:44.830 --> 05:47.700
We don't get a place in the kindergarten next door.

05:47.790 --> 05:51.080
Crap. Really shit, full of disaster.

05:51.160 --> 05:52.750
We'll find a solution.

05:52.830 --> 05:54.750
What's grinning there?

05:54.830 --> 05:57.750
Because you call that a disaster. This is not funny

05:57.830 --> 06:00.950
that's a problem! We need the space now.

06:01.040 --> 06:03.950
Yes, but it's not a disaster, we'll find something.

06:04.290 --> 06:07.200
The other kindergarten was good too. The other?

06:07.290 --> 06:09.040
Further away, but...

06:09.120 --> 06:14.370
Yes, but I want Deniz to have at least a few German children around.

06:16.500 --> 06:18.660
Well, there were a few...

06:20.080 --> 06:23.120
You know what I mean. Yes. We can do it.

06:23.200 --> 06:24.700
I know.

06:25.450 --> 06:27.450
Oh shit. I'm sorry.

06:28.250 --> 06:29.500
Sweetheart. Yes?

06:29.580 --> 06:30.750
Sweetheart. What?

06:30.830 --> 06:32.700
What have you eaten today?

06:32.790 --> 06:35.160
What do you think? You smell...

06:43.410 --> 06:46.830
Wonderful airplane, has two wings and two engines.

06:47.620 --> 06:48.620
Sounds good.

06:49.450 --> 06:51.750
You two seem to know each other well...

06:52.370 --> 06:53.830
Yes we...

06:53.910 --> 06:58.160
We try to separate private and professional as much as possible, but we are...

06:58.250 --> 06:59.790
Ah, are you married?

06:59.870 --> 07:02.540
Not yet, but we have a son together.

07:02.620 --> 07:05.790
Oh! Cool. He's with her mother now. How old is he?

07:05.870 --> 07:09.080
Just turned two. Quite exhausting, I guess.

07:09.160 --> 07:11.870
Yes, but it's worth it.

07:30.450 --> 07:34.330
In English please. My colleague Tobias is an American.

07:34.410 --> 07:36.660
I'm sorry. No, me.I am glad. - Me too.

07:39.450 --> 07:42.080
What. His English is bad, don't worry.

07:42.160 --> 07:44.290
Better than my German. Thanks for that.

07:44.950 --> 07:47.330
Your curb weight is 56.8.

07:47.410 --> 07:49.830
OK. Here is your NOTOC.

07:49.910 --> 07:51.540

07:51.620 --> 07:56.250

07:56.910 --> 08:00.000

08:00.080 --> 08:01.870
Do that. See you soon.

08:01.950 --> 08:03.500
It was a pleasure. As well.

08:03.580 --> 08:05.080
Thank you. See you later.

08:07.370 --> 08:08.750
Oh my God...

08:09.950 --> 08:13.580
I've known the guy forever. Sorry for the disturbance.

08:13.660 --> 08:16.450
You asked for this, right?

08:16.540 --> 08:18.000
Yes. Thank you.

08:18.080 --> 08:20.540
Ready to board? We are born ready.

08:24.790 --> 08:26.790
Okay good. Thank you, Gökçe.

08:26.870 --> 08:28.700
Wait, is it Gökçe or Göçge?

08:29.040 --> 08:30.450
Gokce.

08:30.540 --> 08:31.870
Where does the name come from?

08:31.950 --> 08:34.700
From Turkey. My father is a Turk. Cool.

08:35.200 --> 08:37.159
Thanks for that. With pleasure.

08:41.830 --> 08:43.950
Departure briefing? Yes, go ahead.

08:44.039 --> 08:47.330
All right, this is an A319, the ECAM status is controlled.

08:48.160 --> 08:49.750
No relevant NOTAMs.

08:49.830 --> 08:53.790
We expect a taxi via Romeo-Whiskey-und-Bravo, runway 2-6 on the left.

08:53.870 --> 08:56.410
Expected take-off weight is 54.8 tons,

08:56.500 --> 08:58.750
We have 7.2 tons of kerosene,

08:58.830 --> 09:01.870
that means 1,2 reserve, that gives us about 30 extra minutes,

09:02.410 --> 09:06.080
as calculated. Good evening, are you one of them? Yes.

09:06.160 --> 09:08.200
Then you sit there.

09:08.290 --> 09:11.870

09:11.950 --> 09:16.080

09:16.160 --> 09:17.660

09:18.200 --> 09:19.700
Good thank you.

09:22.870 --> 09:24.580
Welcome. Good evening.

09:25.910 --> 09:28.040
And how long have you been flying?

09:29.370 --> 09:30.700
Around ten years.

09:30.790 --> 09:33.080
Wow, how old are you? 31

09:33.450 --> 09:36.450
So you look younger. Really? - Yes.

09:36.540 --> 09:38.160
Okay thanks.

09:38.250 --> 09:39.290
With pleasure.

09:40.950 --> 09:42.000
Welcome on board.

10:09.580 --> 10:10.700
I'm sorry, boys. Yes?

10:10.790 --> 10:14.250
Bad news. Two passengers are missing and both have luggage.

10:14.620 --> 10:17.020
You're kidding me, aren't you? No, I'm not kidding you.

10:17.750 --> 10:22.660
We're looking for her right now, I've had her called out twice. So far unsuccessful.

10:22.750 --> 10:26.000
You checked in early, so your luggage is probably in the back.

10:27.290 --> 10:30.500
So you have to unload multiple containers?

10:31.120 --> 10:33.370
Yes, it looks like this. Ten minutes? Twelve?

10:33.450 --> 10:36.000
Ten when it's there. A maximum of fifteen.

10:39.500 --> 10:42.410
Your decision. Shall we get it out or wait

10:42.500 --> 10:44.290
how do we do it

10:44.790 --> 10:47.200
No. We are not waiting. Get it out. OK? Yes.

10:47.580 --> 10:50.200
I will call as soon as we have the luggage.

10:50.290 --> 10:53.080
Super. I'm sorry. - Thank you.

10:54.330 --> 10:56.290
I hate that!

10:56.370 --> 10:59.790
We could still wait. At least a few minutes.

10:59.870 --> 11:01.450
If you want.

11:03.120 --> 11:04.870
Yes I know.

11:04.950 --> 11:07.790
No, I don't want to wait.

11:09.200 --> 11:12.410
They’re going to get the bags out, then they’ll have to decide

11:12.500 --> 11:16.540
whether they want to fly without their suitcases. I do not care,

11:16.620 --> 11:18.620
after all the time. I'm sorry.

11:19.370 --> 11:20.700
I get it well.

11:40.200 --> 11:43.410
Are these our passengers? Looks like it, doesn't it?

11:44.910 --> 11:47.790
Floor cockpit. I hear.

11:47.870 --> 11:52.500
I see the two showed up. I see her right now. Thanks Mario.

11:52.580 --> 11:54.120
Are the suitcases out already?

11:54.200 --> 11:56.660
No not yet. They're still in there.

11:56.750 --> 11:59.870
Crap, I'd like to teach them a lesson.

11:59.950 --> 12:02.500
Thank you. Can you still finish me?

12:02.580 --> 12:05.500
Yes, we're done so far. I'll bring you the loading papers right away.

12:05.870 --> 12:07.000
Okay thanks.

12:16.080 --> 12:18.870
Okay, boys, we're through. Boarding completed.

12:18.950 --> 12:20.700
Thank you, Natalie. Have a good flight.

12:20.790 --> 12:22.830
See you later. See you later.

12:24.370 --> 12:26.540
I speak briefly to the passengers.

12:32.200 --> 12:36.450

12:36.540 --> 12:41.120

12:41.500 --> 12:45.250
You may have heard that boarding has ended. Everyone is on board.

12:45.620 --> 12:48.830
So we should be able to leave our position on time.

12:48.910 --> 12:52.330
My colleague Tobias Ellis will fly you today

12:52.410 --> 12:56.160
and will contact you with further information during the flight.

12:56.540 --> 13:00.160
I hope you feel good and I wish you a nice day.

13:00.250 --> 13:01.910
Thank you for your trust.

13:07.040 --> 13:10.450

13:45.370 --> 13:48.830
We have a lot of special dishes, so it gets a bit stressful.

13:48.910 --> 13:52.160
I'm just taking a sandwich and water please. Good.

13:52.250 --> 13:55.080
For me, just a water, non-carbonated. Very much.

15:40.370 --> 15:42.750
Switch on engine defrosting.

15:42.830 --> 15:44.540

European 162,

15:52.660 --> 15:57.330
climb to altitude 2-5-0 and expect turbulence up to cruising altitude.

15:57.660 --> 16:01.000
European 162, altitude 2-5-0, thanks.

16:04.450 --> 16:06.540
Ladies and gentlemen, here is your captain again.

16:06.620 --> 16:11.330
We have learned that turbulence can be expected up to the cruising altitude.

16:11.410 --> 16:14.500
The seat belt signs remain on.

16:14.580 --> 16:20.250
I ask you to stay seated for your own safety and that of our flight attendants.

16:41.540 --> 16:44.540
European 162, hold flight altitude 3-4-0.

16:45.370 --> 16:47.790
European 162, wait a moment, get in touch.

16:54.580 --> 16:59.540
That was probably the bad weather. Then I turn off the seat belt sign, okay?

16:59.620 --> 17:03.250
Yes, do that. Okay. Buckle sign on "AUTO".

17:08.500 --> 17:11.700
The weather forecast for tomorrow doesn't look bad.

17:12.829 --> 17:15.000
I haven't looked at it yet.

17:56.290 --> 17:59.200
European 162, 1-5 degrees to the left.

18:02.450 --> 18:07.160
European 162, 1-5 degrees to the left. That makes course 2-1-7.

18:28.410 --> 18:29.500
So guys...

18:30.160 --> 18:31.450
Allahu Akbar!

19:22.200 --> 19:25.410

Here is Tobias Ellis, the first officer. The captain is injured, but he's okay.

21:02.950 --> 21:06.540
Several men tried to storm the cockpit, but we were unable to do so.

21:06.620 --> 21:10.500
One is still in the cockpit, passed out. The others are in the cabin.

21:10.580 --> 21:14.500

22:36.290 --> 22:39.870
European 162, can you hear me? What is your status

22:39.950 --> 22:43.120
I have the plane under control, but I need a moment!

22:43.200 --> 22:44.830
Understood, we are waiting.

23:20.450 --> 23:21.450
Crap!

23:54.830 --> 23:56.870
Michael, are you still okay? Yes.

23:58.750 --> 24:01.500
Say what! I'm fine, all well...

24:32.700 --> 24:34.660
European 162, I'm listening again.

24:34.750 --> 24:38.410
European 162, we are now alone on the frequency. Where do you want to go?

24:38.500 --> 24:40.830
Back to Berlin. Berlin is 30 minutes away.

24:41.200 --> 24:44.040
Hanover is closer, but reports heavy rain.

24:45.200 --> 24:47.790
Okay, then to Hanover. Roger that.

24:47.870 --> 24:52.120
Right turn, heading 0-6-0. Descend to altitude 1-6-0.

25:02.120 --> 25:05.080
European 162. Right. Heading 0-6-0.

25:05.160 --> 25:08.330
Leave 2-8-0, sink to 1-6-0.

25:08.410 --> 25:11.750
Roger that. Hanover is informed. They are preparing your emergency landing.

25:11.830 --> 25:13.290
Are you okay? Yes.

25:13.370 --> 25:15.450
Stay awake, stay awake! But your arm.

25:15.540 --> 25:17.790
What about your arm OK.

25:17.870 --> 25:21.390
European 162, the federal police have confirmed that you have no Sky Marshals on board.

25:21.660 --> 25:24.080
Do you have any other information?

25:24.160 --> 25:26.120
No, I have no other information.

25:26.200 --> 25:30.750
How is the rest of the crew doing? A flight attendant is wounded or dead.

25:31.080 --> 25:33.926
I still don't know anything about the others, I hope they're safe.

25:33.950 --> 25:35.700
How many attackers are on board?

25:35.790 --> 25:38.120
I counted four, maybe there are more in the back.

25:38.500 --> 25:41.790
How are you armed? I didn't see any real weapons

25:41.870 --> 25:44.620
only glass. They made knives out of glass.

25:44.700 --> 25:49.330
Roger that. Two Eurofighters are on their way to you. T minus 18 minutes.

25:49.700 --> 25:52.200
I am gone for a moment, I have to take care of my wound.

25:52.224 --> 25:54.224
Roger that. We are here for you.

25:54.790 --> 25:57.330
Still okay? Yes / Yes. - Good.

25:57.410 --> 26:00.000
I have to take care of my arm. Good.

26:00.080 --> 26:01.790
And good news...

26:04.790 --> 26:08.540
We're going to Hanover, okay? Hanover... good.

26:48.580 --> 26:50.290
OK.

26:50.370 --> 26:52.080
Everything will be fine.

26:54.700 --> 26:57.000
Are you still okay

27:01.660 --> 27:03.330
Are you doing well?

27:15.160 --> 27:16.580
Carp! Carp!

27:17.000 --> 27:18.000
Crap!

27:19.290 --> 27:21.370
OK. Is okay.

27:21.450 --> 27:25.080
All right. We can do it. We can get this out of here, okay?

27:25.450 --> 27:27.870
Come on, we can do it. Everything will be fine.

27:28.250 --> 27:29.950
One two Three.

27:34.660 --> 27:35.910
It will be allright!

27:36.540 --> 27:38.540
Finished? You can do it.

27:38.620 --> 27:40.700
Finished? One two Three.

27:41.910 --> 27:43.200
OK.

28:05.870 --> 28:07.950
Finished? One two...

28:20.620 --> 28:21.910
Say something!

28:22.000 --> 28:23.080
Wake up.

28:23.160 --> 28:24.410
Wake up!

28:24.790 --> 28:26.000
Crap!

28:26.950 --> 28:28.160
Captain!

28:39.370 --> 28:42.200
Come on, wake up!

29:56.370 --> 29:58.620
European 162, I'm listening again.

29:58.700 --> 30:02.290
European 162, what's up? What happened?

30:02.370 --> 30:04.500
The captain is dead.

30:04.580 --> 30:05.790
Crap.

30:05.870 --> 30:10.080
I'm so sorry. Hanover is prepared. Runway 2-7 on the right.

30:10.160 --> 30:14.540
Runway 2-7 on the right. And say if we can do anything else.

30:15.160 --> 30:19.330
The rescue units are waiting next to the runway and the Eurofighters are with you in T minus 12.

30:38.410 --> 30:42.080
Ladies and gentlemen, this is the pilot speaking.

30:42.160 --> 30:45.540
We have full control over the plane.

30:45.950 --> 30:50.290
Some men have just tried to storm the cockpit

30:50.370 --> 30:52.370
but we prevented that.

30:54.250 --> 30:58.160
We will now make an emergency landing in Hanover, in about 20 minutes.

30:58.250 --> 31:01.910
Until then, I ask you to stay calm.

31:02.000 --> 31:04.120
And buckle up.

32:15.410 --> 32:16.450
European 162,

32:17.250 --> 32:19.330
they have a hostage.

32:19.410 --> 32:22.410
You kill him if I don't open the door.

32:22.910 --> 32:26.000
I'm sorry, under no circumstances should you let them into the cockpit...

32:26.540 --> 32:29.620
Yes I know that! Help! Help me!

32:52.250 --> 32:54.620
Here is Tobias Ellis. I am the pilot.

32:58.950 --> 33:03.250
I'm sorry, I don't speak German. I'm american.

33:05.000 --> 33:06.500
Where's Kinan?

33:08.200 --> 33:09.790
Where's Kinan?

33:12.750 --> 33:15.450
You are not allowed to land, do you understand?

33:16.200 --> 33:19.450
If you land, he kills him! Please let the boy go.

33:23.000 --> 33:26.200
Open the door! I can not do this.

33:28.160 --> 33:29.950
You have ten seconds.

33:30.830 --> 33:34.080
If you don't open in the next ten seconds, he's dead.

33:35.540 --> 33:37.040
Don't do that.

33:37.700 --> 33:39.910
Open the door! Stop. You're welcome.

33:40.000 --> 33:41.160
Let him go.

33:42.330 --> 33:45.120
He kills him, open up! I can't open the door.

33:45.200 --> 33:46.910
How so? - I can not.

33:51.250 --> 33:52.250
Please don't do that!

33:52.660 --> 33:53.660
Ten!

33:55.910 --> 33:56.910
Nine!

33:59.370 --> 34:00.370
Eight!

34:01.000 --> 34:02.500
Seven seconds!

34:03.790 --> 34:05.120
Six.

34:05.200 --> 34:06.580
Six!

34:06.660 --> 34:08.699
Don't do that, don't do that.

34:08.790 --> 34:11.659
Please stop. Stop it.

34:16.449 --> 34:17.620
Five.

34:19.000 --> 34:21.909
Four. He's killing him! I'm so sorry.

34:22.290 --> 34:24.449
I'm so sorry. Unfortunately I can't...

34:24.540 --> 34:26.159
I can't open the door.

34:27.750 --> 34:29.370
Sorry. - Three.

35:14.910 --> 35:18.870
319, status checked, NOTAMs okay.

35:19.910 --> 35:21.620
Expect 2-7 on the right.

35:26.250 --> 35:28.660
Heavy rain and cross winds.

35:30.500 --> 35:32.790
Approach altitude 3000.

35:35.500 --> 35:38.330
Final 1640. Minimum 360.

35:38.910 --> 35:40.660
MSA 3000 ...

35:40.750 --> 35:42.500
ILS 2-7 right.

35:44.040 --> 35:45.830
Automatic brake:

35:45.910 --> 35:46.910
Medium.

35:48.040 --> 35:49.870
If you take off, then go straight to 3000.

36:15.790 --> 36:17.040
Crap.

36:22.620 --> 36:26.370
European 162, Hanover reports that they are prepared.

36:26.450 --> 36:28.950
What is your current status?

36:34.410 --> 36:36.450
I didn't open the door.

36:36.540 --> 36:38.120
The hostage is dead.

36:38.830 --> 36:40.660
I'm sorry.

36:41.620 --> 36:44.870
The fighter jets will be with you in 5 minutes.

36:44.950 --> 36:47.660
Please confirm 2-7 on the right.

36:47.750 --> 36:49.660
2-7 right.

37:04.000 --> 37:05.750
Hello can you hear me

37:07.790 --> 37:12.200
You didn't open Listen. I spoke to the authorities.

37:12.290 --> 37:16.620
When we land and refuel, you can continue flying wherever you want.

37:16.700 --> 37:19.200
You can negotiate whatever you want.

37:19.290 --> 37:20.950
OK? That is the best way.

37:30.750 --> 37:33.620
Tell him we have to land, we don't have enough fuel.

37:34.660 --> 37:36.450
We don't want to land.

37:37.750 --> 37:40.160
We don't want to land! Where did he go?

37:40.540 --> 37:42.620
Do you want to see more people die?

37:42.700 --> 37:44.910
Should More People Die?

38:26.370 --> 38:27.790
Yes I am here.

38:28.410 --> 38:31.290
Let them go! Do you hear me? Let them go!

38:31.870 --> 38:34.410
Then open the door!

38:36.540 --> 38:38.000
I kill your husband.

38:38.870 --> 38:41.910
He's sitting in front of me, passed out, I can just kill him.

38:49.250 --> 38:50.370
Let them go!

38:57.750 --> 39:00.500
Passengers! Listen to me, this is the pilot speaking.

39:00.580 --> 39:04.910
A young woman is in the front of the plane and the kidnappers are threatening to kill her.

39:05.000 --> 39:06.160
But you can stop them!

39:06.450 --> 39:10.040
They are only two and only have glass! You have no weapons!

39:10.500 --> 39:12.870
They don't have knives, just broken glass.

39:12.950 --> 39:16.450
They want to kill the young woman. You're welcome!

39:16.474 --> 39:17.909
Together you can overpower them.

39:17.910 --> 39:21.580
Please come forward. You can stop them, please!

39:21.660 --> 39:23.200
You're welcome!

39:34.620 --> 39:35.910
Are you there?

39:36.910 --> 39:38.830
Hi. Do you hear me?

39:41.620 --> 39:44.120
Hi. Why don't you open the door?

39:45.250 --> 39:48.080
He's going to kill everyone! Listen, you don't want that.

39:48.160 --> 39:50.250
You don't want that either.

39:50.910 --> 39:54.040
I feel that you don't want it. You don't want to kill the woman.

39:54.120 --> 39:55.620
It didn't hurt you.

39:57.870 --> 40:00.410
You are different from him.

40:00.500 --> 40:03.750
Do you hear? You don't want to kill anyone. He's going to kill everyone!

40:03.830 --> 40:06.620
You don't want to kill anyone! He's going to kill everyone!

40:06.700 --> 40:09.910
You are different from him, you don't want to kill anyone.

40:11.160 --> 40:13.700
You can stop him. I can not.

40:13.790 --> 40:16.200
Yes, you can stop him, you can.

40:17.870 --> 40:18.950
I feel that.

40:20.040 --> 40:23.540
You are different, you can stop him.

40:23.620 --> 40:24.870
You're welcome.

40:31.040 --> 40:33.500
I'm begging you You're welcome. You're welcome.

40:35.040 --> 40:36.580
You can, you can.

41:01.910 --> 41:05.330
You're welcome! I have a child, I have a son!

41:06.200 --> 41:08.500
I have a child, a son. You're welcome!

41:27.540 --> 41:29.830
Passengers, buckle up!

41:47.660 --> 41:50.410
Come on, you can do it, finish him off!

41:52.580 --> 41:53.830
Stop him, go!

41:55.700 --> 41:58.700
You can do it, you can do it! You're welcome!

42:17.830 --> 42:19.290
I open up!

42:19.370 --> 42:20.450
I open up.

42:22.790 --> 42:25.120
No, Tobi, please don't open it,

42:25.500 --> 42:27.330
it's OK!

42:32.830 --> 42:35.450
Tobi, take care of our child.

42:35.540 --> 42:37.700
Take care of our child.

42:37.790 --> 42:40.870
Mind Deniz, but please don't open it!

42:41.620 --> 42:44.620
It’s okay. But please don't open the door.

44:15.080 --> 44:18.500
European 162nd German Air Defense. Can you hear me?

44:36.120 --> 44:37.290
Positive, I hear.

44:38.700 --> 44:42.910
We accompany you to Hanover. Follow us.

44:44.370 --> 44:46.000
Roger that.

45:02.700 --> 45:04.120
Open the door!

45:12.580 --> 45:14.040
Help me. Help me.

45:25.910 --> 45:27.620
Open the door!

45:45.080 --> 45:46.540
Help me!

45:48.040 --> 45:49.750
You're welcome. You're welcome.

45:50.410 --> 45:52.790
Open the door! You're welcome. Help.

45:53.750 --> 45:56.040
Open the door! You're welcome.

45:58.910 --> 46:00.660
Come on! Come on!

46:01.040 --> 46:02.950
Where are you?

51:26.120 --> 51:27.700
2500.

52:19.200 --> 52:20.700
Terrain ahead.

52:27.200 --> 52:28.700
Too deep, terrain.

52:53.660 --> 52:55.660
Let me go! Let me go!

52:57.200 --> 52:58.200
1000.

52:58.580 --> 52:59.910
Come on, let me go!

53:00.000 --> 53:01.120
Too deep, terrain.

53:01.620 --> 53:02.700
Pulling up!

53:02.790 --> 53:03.830
Stand up.

54:16.160 --> 54:18.040
Here is Tobias Ellis,

54:18.540 --> 54:20.830
the first officer.

54:20.910 --> 54:25.200
I have the plane under control again. An kidnapper was overwhelmed

54:25.290 --> 54:26.830
the other...

54:29.500 --> 54:31.370
is here with me.

54:32.200 --> 54:35.580
Good to hear your voice. Are you okay?

54:37.500 --> 54:39.830
I'm hurt, but...

54:39.910 --> 54:44.500
I'm okay. Will the emergency landing in Hanover remain?

54:44.580 --> 54:46.500
Yes of course. No!

54:46.580 --> 54:49.426
Hanover is ready. Heavy rain continues. We cannot land.

54:49.450 --> 54:51.330
Wind 2-2-5...

54:51.410 --> 54:54.080
Roger that. We cannot land.

54:54.160 --> 54:57.250
You have to fly me somewhere else. Did you understand that?

54:57.330 --> 54:58.910
Yes.

54:59.000 --> 55:01.910
So fly me somewhere else! You are in control.

55:02.750 --> 55:05.160
But we need fuel. OK?

55:05.250 --> 55:07.540
I already told you that.

55:07.620 --> 55:11.080
We'll land. And then we fill up the plane.

55:11.790 --> 55:14.040
And then you fly somewhere else.

55:17.000 --> 55:19.450
You are lying. No, I do not.

55:19.540 --> 55:23.040
You lie! No, it's how I say it.

55:28.200 --> 55:31.830
European 162, Hanover is still prepared for your emergency landing.

55:31.910 --> 55:34.950
Please confirm ILS 2-7 on the right. It will be alright.

55:35.040 --> 55:37.250
The jets will be with you until you hit the ground.

55:37.790 --> 55:39.540
Confirm 2-7 on the right.

56:01.370 --> 56:04.500
European 162, turn left, heading 0-7-0.

56:05.580 --> 56:08.250
Left, heading 0-7-0.

56:09.540 --> 56:12.540
You should sit down and buckle up.

56:12.620 --> 56:14.870
It's going to be a hard landing.

56:46.660 --> 56:49.410
I should inform the passengers.

56:50.750 --> 56:52.700
Is that okay for you?

56:59.540 --> 57:01.540
Give me the phone.

57:16.580 --> 57:20.120
Ladies and gentlemen, this is your pilot speaking.

57:20.200 --> 57:23.580
The kidnappers are in control of the plane,

57:24.450 --> 57:27.660
but they agree to an emergency landing in Hanover.

57:28.040 --> 57:30.700
I'm afraid the landing will be a little bumpy.

57:30.790 --> 57:33.700
Please buckle up and take the security position.

57:33.790 --> 57:35.750
What is this? Thank you.

57:36.580 --> 57:39.830
That is standard. What do they want?

57:39.910 --> 57:42.410
They stay with us until we land.

57:43.500 --> 57:45.250
Sorry, repeat.

57:45.330 --> 57:49.700
ILS 2-7 on the right is confirmed. Reduce to 170. Heading 2-9-0 left.

57:52.950 --> 57:57.250
Heading 2-9-0 left, ILS 2-7 confirmed right, reduce to 170.

58:14.290 --> 58:16.700
Okay, the weather is getting worse.

58:22.700 --> 58:25.450
Too bad for the autopilot.

58:25.540 --> 58:27.250
I have to fly it by hand.

58:30.410 --> 58:34.500
But I can't move my left arm, so you have to help me, okay?

58:35.370 --> 58:36.370
Say okay!

58:41.000 --> 58:42.000
OK.

58:42.370 --> 58:45.450
So, that's the throttle. The big one in the middle.

58:45.790 --> 58:47.540
Do you see this number

58:47.620 --> 58:50.460
If you move it back and forth, that percentage changes, okay?

58:50.580 --> 58:53.000
So pull it back until it reads 54.

58:53.080 --> 58:54.410
Slowly!

58:55.870 --> 58:57.700
Slowly slowly.

58:57.790 --> 58:58.830
Slowly slowly.

58:59.200 --> 59:00.540
54.

59:00.620 --> 59:02.000
Okay good.

59:03.370 --> 59:06.120
I now extend the landing gear.

59:06.200 --> 59:08.370
And these are the landing lights. And the wipers.

59:09.500 --> 59:13.250
I will now switch off the autopilot. From then on you have to listen to me.

59:13.330 --> 59:15.540
Because my hand is on the stick.

59:15.620 --> 59:17.500
Understood everything? Yes.

59:18.000 --> 59:20.500
Okay, I'll turn it off.

59:21.200 --> 59:22.660
Autopilot.

59:36.120 --> 59:37.040
2500.

59:37.120 --> 59:42.000
Okay, you have to move the flaps. Set the "FLAPS" lever to three.

59:42.080 --> 59:43.410
"FLAPS". Yes, on three.

59:43.750 --> 59:45.330
Now, go, go, go!

59:45.410 --> 59:47.750
Pull him up and then set him to three.

59:48.580 --> 59:51.540
How come? Three. Pull him up and put him on three.

59:52.040 --> 59:53.250
High. High!

59:54.120 --> 59:56.806
There is four, there is one. Do you see the three Better explain that to me!

59:56.830 --> 59:57.910
Three, the number three.

59:58.000 --> 59:59.330
Stall.

01:00:00.700 --> 01:00:01.950
OK. Good.

01:00:04.250 --> 01:00:06.200
Now set it to four. Another one.

01:00:06.870 --> 01:00:11.410
Pull up and one more back. And now the boost to 45 percent.

01:00:14.120 --> 01:00:15.500
Good.

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:30.370
Good.

01:00:31.160 --> 01:00:33.450
Final height. Controlled.

01:00:34.410 --> 01:00:36.000
Final checklist.

01:00:36.080 --> 01:00:38.200
Final. Landing configured.

01:00:39.950 --> 01:00:43.580
European 162, contact the tower at 124.5.

01:00:43.660 --> 01:00:45.000
Negative, not possible.

01:00:45.080 --> 01:00:47.660
Okay, no problem, stay on that frequency.

01:00:47.750 --> 01:00:50.950

01:00:52.500 --> 01:00:54.120

If I tell you... not yet,

01:01:35.160 --> 01:01:38.540
but when I say "now" you pull the lever all the way back, okay?

01:01:38.620 --> 01:01:41.200
Not yet. When I say it

01:01:41.290 --> 01:01:42.620
300.

01:02:38.540 --> 01:02:41.120
European 162. Good landing.

01:02:59.620 --> 01:03:01.870
European 162, I just learned

01:03:01.950 --> 01:03:05.540
that the police will contact you on this frequency.

01:03:05.620 --> 01:03:08.040
I wish you all the best.

01:03:34.750 --> 01:03:36.660
What's this?

01:03:37.790 --> 01:03:39.700
What's this?

01:03:39.790 --> 01:03:42.250
These are the emergency exits.

01:03:45.160 --> 01:03:46.950
You get off the plane.

01:04:09.450 --> 01:04:10.750
What are you doing there?

01:04:11.700 --> 01:04:15.620
What are you doing there? I just wanted to unbuckle, that's all.

01:04:17.250 --> 01:04:18.830
Come here!

01:04:19.950 --> 01:04:21.410

01:04:39.450 --> 01:04:40.700

01:04:52.200 --> 01:04:53.950
Sit down!

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:08.700
I feel dizzy.

01:05:34.200 --> 01:05:36.160
How can I speak to him

01:05:40.700 --> 01:05:42.410
The microphone. Where?

01:05:43.410 --> 01:05:45.120

01:05:58.120 --> 01:06:01.000
You have to press the button.

01:06:01.080 --> 01:06:02.700
The button...

01:06:04.080 --> 01:06:06.290
it says "RADIO". "WHEEL".

01:07:13.540 --> 01:07:14.910
Look at me.

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.200
How long does it take to refuel?

01:07:18.160 --> 01:07:21.790
45 minutes, one hour, depends on where we are.

01:07:23.910 --> 01:07:27.700
Do not lie to me. I dont lie. It's that long.

01:08:24.200 --> 01:08:26.410
How can I make that out

01:08:33.160 --> 01:08:34.870
Left of the seat.

01:08:38.080 --> 01:08:39.870
There is a rotary switch.

01:08:41.120 --> 01:08:43.580
Four rotary switches. One says "VOLUME".

01:08:58.790 --> 01:09:00.500
Close your eyes.

01:09:05.370 --> 01:09:07.910
Close your eyes. Why?

01:09:14.540 --> 01:09:16.330
Close your eyes.

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:23.000

01:12:01.250 --> 01:12:03.000

01:12:03.700 --> 01:12:05.330

I live in Kreuzberg.

01:12:25.120 --> 01:12:26.830
Wilhelmstrasse.

01:12:29.580 --> 01:12:31.580
Where's the playground?

01:12:36.200 --> 01:12:38.250
I often go there with...

01:12:39.200 --> 01:12:40.700
my son.

01:12:47.830 --> 01:12:49.870
Deniz. That's his name.

01:12:53.200 --> 01:12:55.620
Deniz is a Turkish name.

01:12:56.370 --> 01:12:59.450
Like yours, right? Yes.

01:13:00.750 --> 01:13:03.450
His mother was half Turkish.

01:13:08.580 --> 01:13:09.910
What happened to her?

01:13:36.450 --> 01:13:38.410
You should end this here.

01:13:38.500 --> 01:13:42.160
It is better for you if you stop now.

01:13:44.620 --> 01:13:46.040
I can not.

01:13:46.120 --> 01:13:48.660
Yes you can. I can not.

01:13:49.450 --> 01:13:51.500
I can’t go anywhere.

01:13:52.950 --> 01:13:54.620
Not after all of that.

01:14:01.250 --> 01:14:02.910
Not after this.

01:14:15.160 --> 01:14:16.700
How old are you?

01:14:18.540 --> 01:14:19.700
18th

01:16:01.700 --> 01:16:03.120
What do you do?

01:16:03.450 --> 01:16:05.040
What do you do? Nothing.

01:16:05.120 --> 01:16:07.080
What are you doing there? I did not do anything.

01:16:07.620 --> 01:16:08.700
What's this?

01:16:09.080 --> 01:16:11.200
What's this? I don't know, I don't know.

01:16:11.290 --> 01:16:13.636
That wasn't there before. Where do you want to get that from?

01:16:13.660 --> 01:16:15.886
That wasn't there before! There's a lot of stuff around here...

01:16:15.910 --> 01:16:18.450
Why are you doing this to me? I did nothing! Why?

01:16:18.830 --> 01:16:20.330
I did nothing!

01:16:45.200 --> 01:16:46.950
No movement.

01:17:06.200 --> 01:17:09.040
How do you open the window?

01:17:12.700 --> 01:17:16.200
Press the button down and pull the handle.

01:17:23.080 --> 01:17:26.040
If you move, I'll kill you.

01:18:19.200 --> 01:18:21.500
You should calm down. If you...

01:18:43.580 --> 01:18:45.040
Stand up.

01:18:47.330 --> 01:18:48.500
Stand up!

01:19:13.250 --> 01:19:15.090
Mr. Ellis, how are you? Do you need...

01:19:24.410 --> 01:19:26.080
Do not move.

01:20:33.500 --> 01:20:34.790
Mummy?

01:20:43.700 --> 01:20:45.410
I trusted them.

01:22:01.540 --> 01:22:03.450
Don't look at me!

01:22:07.330 --> 01:22:09.200
Not not not. Do not do that.

01:22:10.700 --> 01:22:12.250
Do not do that.

01:22:12.330 --> 01:22:15.000
Put the knife away. Take it down, please.

01:22:16.500 --> 01:22:17.950
Take it away

01:22:18.040 --> 01:22:20.540
Listen to me. Listen to me.

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:24.160
Take the knife down. Take the knife down.

01:22:25.500 --> 01:22:27.540
Put it away.

01:22:28.660 --> 01:22:30.200
OK? OK?

01:22:36.250 --> 01:22:40.790
OK then. Away with it. Raise your hands and show them to him.

01:22:40.870 --> 01:22:42.000
Show it to him.

01:22:43.200 --> 01:22:44.370
Show it to him.

01:22:44.450 --> 01:22:45.660
Do not do that!

01:22:46.450 --> 01:22:48.450
I tell you... listen to me!

01:22:49.040 --> 01:22:50.200
Listen to me!

01:22:50.620 --> 01:22:52.950
Vedat! Shut up! Shut up!

01:22:56.250 --> 01:22:57.250
Shut up!

01:23:02.080 --> 01:23:05.580
Do not do that. You don't have to... Take your arm down! Okay.

01:23:10.370 --> 01:23:13.790
Dont move. I'm not moving. I'm not moving.

01:23:15.370 --> 01:23:18.080
Listen, please. You know me.

01:23:18.160 --> 01:23:20.910
You know me. OK?

01:23:21.870 --> 01:23:24.160
I do not know you. But.

01:23:24.250 --> 01:23:27.000
I do not know you! My name is Tobias.

01:23:27.080 --> 01:23:29.000
You are Vedat.

01:23:29.080 --> 01:23:32.080
Just like me... you live in Kreuzberg.

01:23:34.330 --> 01:23:37.450
I can't leave my son alone. His name is D...

01:23:50.250 --> 01:23:52.750
Mr. Ellis, are you okay?

01:23:56.040 --> 01:23:58.830
Mr. Ellis! Let me know that you are fine!

01:23:58.910 --> 01:24:00.700
OK. OK.

01:24:00.790 --> 01:24:02.660
Breathe, breathe, breathe.

01:24:05.700 --> 01:24:07.410
A doctor!

01:24:07.500 --> 01:24:09.330
We need a doctor!

01:24:18.540 --> 01:24:20.700
OK. It will be again.

01:24:21.750 --> 01:24:23.660
Pilot, open the door!

01:24:26.160 --> 01:24:28.870
Open the door! It's open!

01:24:35.660 --> 01:24:38.000
We need a doctor! A doctor!

01:24:44.500 --> 01:24:46.120
Get out of here.

01:24:46.200 --> 01:24:47.870
Come on. Move.

01:24:48.370 --> 01:24:49.790
Come on, exercise!

01:24:50.290 --> 01:24:51.290
Come on!
