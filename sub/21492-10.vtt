WEBVTT

00:05.180 --> 00:07.046
Previously on "Mr. Mercedes"...

00:07.071 --> 00:08.406
This will be my masterpiece

00:08.447 --> 00:10.935
and will make us rich,
and it will reunite us.

00:11.035 --> 00:12.675
Roseland Hills Community Center.

00:12.708 --> 00:14.356
- It's his M.O.
- Let the police handle it.

00:14.380 --> 00:16.575
He wasn't just killing
people two years ago.

00:16.635 --> 00:17.761
He was mowing down hope.

00:17.790 --> 00:19.034
I got a lot of concerned people,

00:19.128 --> 00:21.088
especially with this
Edmund Mills gala coming up.

00:21.179 --> 00:22.747
He wants me. I'm his target.

00:22.814 --> 00:24.241
Let him come, I say. Let him come.

00:24.276 --> 00:26.677
Do we have a retired detective
compromising this investigation?

00:26.860 --> 00:28.894
We do not. If anything,
that retired detective

00:28.932 --> 00:30.081
was instrumental in breaking it.

00:30.106 --> 00:31.810
This is who serviced her computer.

00:31.857 --> 00:33.691
What are you doing with the speakers?

00:33.736 --> 00:35.755
I spoke to Josh about setting
up a viewing station

00:35.780 --> 00:38.290
so kids can watch it
while their parents shop.

00:38.570 --> 00:41.098
You get the kids, you get the parents.

00:41.357 --> 00:42.803
Same as selling ice cream.

00:42.871 --> 00:45.096
We have some questions
about an Olivia Trelawney.

00:45.130 --> 00:46.630
You mean the Mercedes lady?

00:46.671 --> 00:48.369
She ever take service calls
in her home?

00:48.394 --> 00:50.395
It's always Brady Hartsfield.
She requested him.

00:50.420 --> 00:52.369
The ice-cream guy is your suspect?

00:52.394 --> 00:54.128
Been hiding in plain sight ever since.

00:54.379 --> 00:55.700
Right under my fucking nose.

00:55.725 --> 00:57.680
- Why are the police looking for me?
- How did you get in here?!

00:57.705 --> 00:59.511
Are you gonna make me ask you again?

00:59.551 --> 01:00.970
You're the Mercedes killer?

01:01.038 --> 01:03.378
Step out of the vehicle immediately!

01:06.079 --> 01:09.215
Take the house!

01:10.902 --> 01:12.187
John, you better see this.

01:12.216 --> 01:13.614
- Out!
- Everybody, out!

01:13.645 --> 01:15.174
- Go, go!
- We got to go now!

01:15.293 --> 01:16.655
Bill!

01:19.309 --> 01:21.205
It's over, partner. We got him.

01:22.786 --> 01:24.120
Maybe.

01:26.000 --> 01:32.074

02:55.166 --> 02:57.501
I'll take a Chipwich right after.

02:57.596 --> 02:59.322
Is that a Chipwich I hear, sir?

02:59.364 --> 03:00.764
Yeah, of course you did.

03:00.805 --> 03:02.540
- Mmm!
- Mmm!

03:02.753 --> 03:03.804
Delish!

03:03.849 --> 03:05.182
Oh, absolutely.

03:06.926 --> 03:08.360
Hi, Daddy.

03:08.459 --> 03:10.294
- Hi, Mr. Hodges.
- Hey, Bill.

03:11.916 --> 03:14.201
Hey, Mr. Hodges.

03:14.285 --> 03:15.652
The usual?

03:15.901 --> 03:17.654
Double fudge?

03:17.802 --> 03:19.804
Fatty?

03:19.829 --> 03:22.562
Bill... Bill, let me have the gun.

03:22.755 --> 03:24.242
Let me have it, come on.

03:24.362 --> 03:26.726
You go have some fun.

03:27.605 --> 03:29.874
Go on. Have some ice cream.

03:31.002 --> 03:32.135
Daddy.

03:32.203 --> 03:33.905
- Daddy!
- Go ahead.

03:33.971 --> 03:35.405
Come push me on the swing.

03:35.440 --> 03:36.474
Want a bite of mine?

03:38.743 --> 03:40.677
Don't forget your fudge!

03:50.128 --> 03:52.195
Whoo!

03:57.228 --> 04:00.888
Faster!

04:08.235 --> 04:09.915
Daddy!

04:09.994 --> 04:12.062
Allie!

04:14.281 --> 04:15.621
Daddy, help!

04:15.646 --> 04:17.398
Allie!

04:18.922 --> 04:20.483
Allie!

04:27.658 --> 04:30.360
N-o-o-o-o!

04:30.401 --> 04:31.835
Allie!

04:32.076 --> 04:34.011
Allie!

05:40.731 --> 05:42.566
It's not your day.

05:42.791 --> 05:44.194
Yeah.

05:44.219 --> 05:46.153
Had to mow all my lawns today.

05:46.337 --> 05:48.218
Speaking at this gala thing tomorrow.

05:49.674 --> 05:53.076
Man... you look like
awful fucked terrible,

05:53.217 --> 05:55.234
and you're what came out
nine months later.

05:57.367 --> 05:58.968
You all right?

06:00.344 --> 06:01.946
Yeah, haven't been sleeping good.

06:04.542 --> 06:06.210
Well, you got him.

06:11.735 --> 06:13.029
He got himself.

06:14.608 --> 06:16.842
He controlled it all,
right up to the end.

06:17.020 --> 06:18.482
No.

06:18.576 --> 06:21.311
We were closing in on him,
and he knew it.

06:21.792 --> 06:23.227
"We"?

06:24.495 --> 06:25.726
Yeah.

06:26.015 --> 06:27.417
"We."

06:38.095 --> 06:40.523
What a summer, man.

06:44.320 --> 06:45.968
Yeah, I'm gonna get back to work.

06:58.155 --> 07:00.690
Will you be needing it?

07:00.998 --> 07:02.933
No, you go ahead.

07:08.432 --> 07:11.201
You're gonna have to sit with it
sooner or later, you know.

07:14.110 --> 07:15.578
Sit with what?

07:15.714 --> 07:18.122
Your loss.

07:18.235 --> 07:19.835
Got to be on the move, Ida.

07:20.010 --> 07:22.110
Motion isn't release.

07:22.205 --> 07:23.940
It's just motion.

07:26.037 --> 07:28.093
The truth is, I need it right now.

07:32.535 --> 07:35.637
If I stop, I'll drown.

07:37.868 --> 07:40.724
When you're ready, then.

07:43.553 --> 07:45.177
My mother...

07:48.592 --> 07:50.532
...I loved her...

07:51.515 --> 07:54.550
but she tried "talking to me,"

07:54.771 --> 07:57.113
and I didn't want to be talked to.

07:57.194 --> 07:59.230
Tonight, I told her what I'd done.

07:59.355 --> 08:01.590
I thought she'd be proud,

08:01.631 --> 08:04.218
finally say I'd done something worthy.

08:04.327 --> 08:06.395
She said I was sick and repulsive,

08:06.550 --> 08:09.919
that I should be hung
by my neck for what I did.

08:10.060 --> 08:12.995
Crkkkk!

08:13.122 --> 08:14.664
So now she's gone.

08:14.770 --> 08:17.254
All gone.

08:17.388 --> 08:23.192
Just like the peas on my plate
when I was a kid

08:23.447 --> 08:25.615
All gone. I miss her.

08:25.949 --> 08:27.816
I loved her.

08:27.951 --> 08:30.621
My pretty poor mommy.

08:34.711 --> 08:38.380
And I can't live here
without her, without...

08:41.184 --> 08:45.522
I'm thinking... time to go.

08:45.983 --> 08:49.045
And guess what.

08:49.540 --> 08:53.810
I'm not sorry for hating you all,

08:54.111 --> 08:56.579
not even a little.

09:01.804 --> 09:05.841
You all walking around
in your lead boots

09:05.929 --> 09:07.298
you like to call a conscience.

09:07.323 --> 09:09.257
Well, I was born wearing none

09:09.919 --> 09:13.322
so I could soar high above you all

09:13.640 --> 09:15.996
and watch you stuff your faces

09:16.119 --> 09:18.320
and flick your remotes

09:18.502 --> 09:22.956
and pray to a god you
only half believe in.

09:23.273 --> 09:26.175
It's all just a lie.

09:26.222 --> 09:28.526
The truth is blackness.

09:28.639 --> 09:31.805
And the only thing that matters...

09:32.336 --> 09:34.637
is making a statement

09:35.037 --> 09:37.240
before you enter it.

09:40.777 --> 09:44.980
Peeling back the skin of the Earth

09:45.048 --> 09:46.727
and leaving a scar.

09:46.810 --> 09:50.045
That's what history is... scar tissue.

09:50.500 --> 09:51.910
Fuck it.

09:52.115 --> 09:53.654
I'm Audi.

09:56.720 --> 10:00.752
I painted my masterpiece
a couple years ago,

10:00.891 --> 10:05.262
and I can't imagine how I could
possibly top it.

10:08.238 --> 10:10.641
What have any of you
done to be remembered?

10:29.400 --> 10:32.635
So... good night.

10:34.248 --> 10:36.883
Good fuck.

10:37.347 --> 10:39.872
I hope you're all condemned

10:40.070 --> 10:43.218
to live your meaningless lives...

10:44.961 --> 10:48.764
over... and over

10:49.112 --> 10:51.131
for-fucking-ever.

11:03.053 --> 11:04.353
Thank you.

11:04.774 --> 11:05.933
For what?

11:05.958 --> 11:07.186
Narrowing down the location

11:07.211 --> 11:09.153
of Hartsfield's home and his job,

11:09.199 --> 11:11.267
breaking this case after we stopped.

11:11.501 --> 11:13.157
What were you two doing again?

11:14.230 --> 11:16.065
We were hung up on other cases.

11:16.112 --> 11:17.708
So that's gonna be our story?

11:17.733 --> 11:19.395
We missed catching the Mercedes killer

11:19.420 --> 11:21.087
because we were otherwise occupied?

11:21.149 --> 11:23.305
It may not play
well, but it's the truth.

11:23.860 --> 11:25.832
What if he planted other bombs behind?

11:25.929 --> 11:27.729
Brady Hartsfield wasn't the type

11:27.754 --> 11:29.265
to just slink away and kill himself,

11:29.290 --> 11:31.091
I'm telling you.

11:31.744 --> 11:33.914
We're gonna send a bomb-squad
team to clear your house,

11:33.939 --> 11:35.273
send one to Edmund Mills.

11:35.586 --> 11:37.885
Anywhere else a likely target?

11:37.974 --> 11:39.808
There's a career night tomorrow.

11:40.050 --> 11:41.170
Where?

11:41.195 --> 11:43.063
The Roseland Hotel.

11:43.199 --> 11:45.734
He went after job seekers
the first time.

11:46.122 --> 11:47.746
You're on the co-workers next?

11:47.838 --> 11:50.207
I'm on the bomb squad.
We'll sweep those areas.

11:52.103 --> 11:53.605
Bill?

11:54.751 --> 11:56.339
Your house is off-limits for a while,

11:56.364 --> 11:58.698
so why don't you stick around
in an advisory capacity.

11:58.723 --> 12:01.527
You need to sign nondisclosure
and release-of-liability forms.

12:01.552 --> 12:03.362
- You good with that?
- Grand.

12:10.660 --> 12:12.828
Miss Linklatter, thanks for coming in.

12:13.222 --> 12:14.485
How you doing?

12:15.992 --> 12:17.492
Fuckin' great.

12:18.361 --> 12:20.143
 No matter how small it may seem,

12:20.168 --> 12:22.282
if anything occurs to you
about Brady Hartsfield,

12:22.307 --> 12:23.508
you give us a call.

12:25.120 --> 12:26.428
All right.

12:28.830 --> 12:31.307
Miss "Linkletter," if you'd
come with us, please.

12:33.374 --> 12:35.075
It's "Link-later."

12:35.463 --> 12:36.721
Oh, Josh.

12:37.899 --> 12:39.671
We're having trouble
locating your store manager,

12:39.696 --> 12:41.029
Anthony Frobisher.

12:41.302 --> 12:42.603
It's his day off.

12:42.671 --> 12:44.772
We sent someone by his house.
No answer.

12:44.797 --> 12:46.564
He goes to see his dad.

12:46.828 --> 12:48.329
Yeah?

12:48.730 --> 12:50.274
Yeah, on his days off,

12:50.299 --> 12:53.334
he always goes to visit
his dad in Bedford.

12:53.433 --> 12:55.004
Let's look up a Frobisher in...

12:55.029 --> 12:58.665
The only Frobisher that comes up
in Bedford... Xavier, 69...

12:59.206 --> 13:02.476
lives on Meyers Road,
one son... Anthony.

13:04.723 --> 13:06.281
All right, right this way.

13:08.444 --> 13:10.117
Some are calling him
the Mercedes killer.

13:10.142 --> 13:11.344
I can't believe it.

13:11.997 --> 13:13.263
Wow.

13:13.307 --> 13:16.843
Police believe Brady is
a strong connection to this.

13:16.868 --> 13:19.636
Again, we're reporting live
from Elm Street...

13:19.700 --> 13:21.387
The cash wrap looks like shit,

13:21.412 --> 13:23.814
and stock from last week
is still in the back room,

13:23.892 --> 13:25.260
not on the floor.

13:27.015 --> 13:29.450
And we open in 12 minutes.

13:48.556 --> 13:50.596
Detective Dixon, please.

13:50.745 --> 13:53.567
Come on. Let's go. Let's go.

13:56.317 --> 13:58.585
We had no choice but to close, sir.

13:59.379 --> 14:00.865
Over here.

14:01.221 --> 14:04.023
Yes, I am aware of declining sales,

14:04.048 --> 14:05.535
but, sir, you are aware
that Brady Hart...

14:11.814 --> 14:14.515
I understand.
But if there's a bomb, sir...

14:24.499 --> 14:26.139
All clear.

14:27.722 --> 14:30.090
It looks like we got the all-clear.

14:30.498 --> 14:32.772
Yes, yes, right away.

14:32.999 --> 14:35.236
Abso...

14:36.145 --> 14:37.411
Where's Taylor?

14:37.484 --> 14:39.272
Dude, she fuckin' quit.

14:47.001 --> 14:50.136
These are our personal cells.

14:50.404 --> 14:53.066
24/7.

14:53.354 --> 14:54.999
We never close.

14:55.376 --> 14:57.769
You did the right thing here.

14:57.846 --> 14:59.914
You can't be too paranoid right now.

15:00.528 --> 15:01.746
Sure.

15:01.789 --> 15:03.925
No. For real.

15:08.343 --> 15:10.978
Right.

15:11.806 --> 15:13.254
Yeah, will do.

15:15.449 --> 15:16.583
Okay, yeah.

15:16.608 --> 15:17.676
Talk soon.

15:23.004 --> 15:24.873
All right, let's roll.

15:29.123 --> 15:30.857
Coroner?

15:30.985 --> 15:33.920
Brady Hartsfield had no dentist.

15:34.501 --> 15:38.071
Maybe a sole redeeming
quality was good teeth.

15:41.075 --> 15:43.477
The mother?

15:44.318 --> 15:46.788
Her dentals match, yeah,
but nothing on the son.

15:49.091 --> 15:52.127
Bomb squad's cleared this
house and Edmund Mills.

15:54.822 --> 15:56.211
The Roseland?

15:56.236 --> 15:59.472
Yeah, that was a bitch, I hear.

16:00.421 --> 16:02.070
Look, nothing went boom today,

16:02.095 --> 16:05.197
and all the likely targets
are bomb-free.

16:06.260 --> 16:07.626
That's something.

16:15.136 --> 16:16.775
Speak it.

16:17.852 --> 16:20.121
You think he's dead?

16:22.256 --> 16:23.957
Yes.

16:24.685 --> 16:26.287
I do.

16:27.048 --> 16:28.609
But?

16:28.729 --> 16:30.218
They found an egress.

16:32.941 --> 16:35.075
Hidden door in the basement.

16:35.222 --> 16:36.400
Tunnel connected.

16:38.539 --> 16:41.742
So he could've got out... anytime.

16:48.663 --> 16:51.898
[Sonic Youth's

18:03.087 --> 18:04.621
What's the word?

18:04.719 --> 18:06.723
Nothing on DNA yet, but the M.E. said

18:06.788 --> 18:09.890
the female looks to have been
dead longer than the male.

18:10.104 --> 18:11.482
Well, it has to be significant

18:11.507 --> 18:13.342
if he can tell from a prelim stage.

18:13.548 --> 18:16.014
And he said he's not finding
any signs of blunt-force trauma

18:16.039 --> 18:17.506
to her corpse.

18:17.759 --> 18:20.601
He's waiting on tox work.

18:20.665 --> 18:22.768
Jesus, everybody's fuckin'
waiting on things.

18:23.057 --> 18:25.258
Isn't this the 21st century?

18:25.419 --> 18:27.103
What are you, a civilian?
This shit takes time.

18:27.156 --> 18:30.557
As I was saying, prior to tox
work, he suspects poison.

18:30.592 --> 18:33.561
Something to do with the
clench of the jaw, he said.

18:35.676 --> 18:39.370
Well... he sold it in the video
like he snapped.

18:39.453 --> 18:42.236
You don't snap and then take
the time to poison someone.

18:42.360 --> 18:44.395
Yeah. One more curio.

18:44.420 --> 18:47.145
The male <i>did</i> have blunt trauma
to the back of the head,

18:47.275 --> 18:50.084
but that's where a beam
landed in the fire,

18:50.138 --> 18:51.367
so it could be that.

18:52.848 --> 18:54.673
You coming by?

18:54.791 --> 18:56.741
I'll be in.

18:56.913 --> 18:59.851
There you go.
And, um... just in the bag?

18:59.876 --> 19:01.042
Yeah, thanks.

19:01.165 --> 19:03.367
- Thank you for shopping Supreme.
- Thank you.

19:10.901 --> 19:13.103
Hi. You've reached the
voicemail of Anthony Frobisher.

19:13.128 --> 19:14.495
Please leave a message.

19:14.520 --> 19:17.298
It's Josh... again.
You're two hours late!

19:18.543 --> 19:20.266
Hope you have a hell of a reason.

19:22.600 --> 19:24.293
Oh, thank Christ you're here.

19:24.318 --> 19:25.318
Where's Robi?

19:25.343 --> 19:27.344
I don't know. Can you watch the front?

19:27.456 --> 19:29.445
- No problem.
- I've got to run an errand.

19:44.568 --> 19:45.603
Robi!

21:01.231 --> 21:02.464
We're clear.

21:02.846 --> 21:04.120
Josh.

21:07.710 --> 21:09.420
See anything out of the ordinary?

21:13.248 --> 21:15.984
I've only been here once.

21:29.891 --> 21:32.459
No, not that I can tell.

21:33.111 --> 21:35.631
Let's sticker the door and
get a forensic crew over.

21:35.770 --> 21:37.071
Can't hurt.

21:37.138 --> 21:38.873
There was a rug here.

21:41.350 --> 21:43.200
It was here three days ago.

21:46.881 --> 21:48.950
I got one in the car.

22:57.919 --> 22:59.078
What do you got?

22:59.103 --> 23:01.438
Fuckin' crime scene is what we got.

23:01.656 --> 23:03.823
Frobisher is 6-foot, 6'1"?

23:04.917 --> 23:06.254
That sounds right.

23:06.279 --> 23:07.847
How tall is Brady?

23:07.872 --> 23:10.141
Shorter... maybe 5'8 ", 5'9".

23:15.817 --> 23:17.317
Hey, Chris, it's Pete.

23:17.365 --> 23:19.299
You in the morgue or at your desk?

23:19.777 --> 23:21.508
Great. Um...

23:21.644 --> 23:25.646
I need a height on the male
corpse from Elm Street.

23:26.040 --> 23:28.309
Yeah.

23:29.197 --> 23:30.999
Got it. Thanks.

23:33.648 --> 23:35.048
Corpse in Brady Hartsfield's bed

23:35.089 --> 23:37.425
was 6 feet, 1 1/2 inches.

23:41.810 --> 23:44.043
And noone's seen Brady Hartsfield's co-worker

23:44.068 --> 23:45.463
since the night of the explosion.

23:46.715 --> 23:47.829
I know it's crazy, but, uh...

23:47.854 --> 23:50.549
But it's not impossible, either. Fuck.

23:51.112 --> 23:52.613
I'd say he's alive.

23:52.638 --> 23:55.073
He's staying under until he can
make another statement,

23:55.098 --> 23:56.898
bigger than the last one.

23:56.923 --> 23:57.993
You think the gala?

23:58.018 --> 23:59.819
Half the town will be there.

23:59.844 --> 24:01.819
The other half will be at
career night at the Roseland.

24:01.844 --> 24:03.711
Last time, he did go after job seekers.

24:03.951 --> 24:05.785
Edmund Mills is easier to secure.

24:05.879 --> 24:08.748
The Roseland has 300 rooms, an
attached convention center,

24:08.773 --> 24:11.308
entrances off that,
the street, the garages...

24:11.686 --> 24:13.354
River ferry.

24:13.715 --> 24:15.379
If I'm him and I'm looking for a target

24:15.424 --> 24:18.626
with the highest possibility
of success, it's the Roseland.

24:18.873 --> 24:21.508
- Agreed.
- Shit, shit, shit.

24:22.426 --> 24:24.838
You two get back to the station.

24:25.027 --> 24:26.433
I want your laptop.

24:26.484 --> 24:28.637
See if there's anything our guys
can find in what he sent you,

24:28.662 --> 24:30.296
anything that might tip his hand.

24:30.365 --> 24:31.832
I'll go get it.

24:32.213 --> 24:35.586
I'll talk to the mayor, see
how he wants to proceed.

25:04.212 --> 25:06.105
Is there any tangible proof of this?

25:06.180 --> 25:09.416
No, but if he's alive,
the career night at the Roseland

25:09.441 --> 25:11.542
would make for an obvious target.

25:11.592 --> 25:13.313
The gala would be the other.

25:13.384 --> 25:15.218
People are already
lined up at the gala.

25:15.309 --> 25:17.076
 If I had one specific threat,

25:17.101 --> 25:19.470
anything to justify
canceling it, I would.

25:19.501 --> 25:21.502
You can't shut it down
on conjecture, Brooke.

25:22.466 --> 25:24.298
And what about the Roseland?

25:24.606 --> 25:26.818
Am I supposed to kick
300 guests to the curb?

25:26.968 --> 25:28.402
Who's already through the gates?

25:29.164 --> 25:30.834
Performers, vendors,

25:30.872 --> 25:32.907
some V.I.P.s,
people with special needs.

25:34.156 --> 25:36.324
I'm gonna send a detachment
to the Roseland

25:36.349 --> 25:38.677
and a small detail to the gala.

25:38.766 --> 25:40.467
We're gonna be thin in both places.

25:40.515 --> 25:42.716
I can beef up private security.

25:42.750 --> 25:45.418
Need all the help we can get.

25:45.946 --> 25:49.499
Here's a picture of Hartsfield.
Make copies, pass it out.

26:17.001 --> 26:18.074
Hello?

26:18.099 --> 26:20.924
Hey. Hockney said forget
about the computer right now

26:20.949 --> 26:22.516
and get over to the Roseland.

26:22.563 --> 26:24.484
She needs good eyes helping
with the security detail,

26:24.509 --> 26:25.664
and you've seen Brady in the flesh.

26:25.689 --> 26:27.039
They're not gonna evacuate?

26:27.221 --> 26:28.555
Yeah, based on what?

26:29.890 --> 26:31.341
How about the gala?

26:32.629 --> 26:34.147
H.Q.'s betting on Roseland.

26:35.703 --> 26:38.542
Yeah, all right. Uh, I'm heading over.

26:38.580 --> 26:40.133
Just let them know
I'm coming, will you?

26:40.174 --> 26:41.453
Yeah, talk soon.

27:01.028 --> 27:02.562
What is peace?

27:02.842 --> 27:05.970
Is what you call peace
the same peace as it is to me?

27:06.434 --> 27:08.522
Nah. Peace to me feels like I'm chained

27:08.603 --> 27:10.156
on a leash by the Devil himself,

27:10.207 --> 27:11.615
who's standing there laughing at me

27:11.640 --> 27:13.807
because, you see, as
long as I don't know me,

27:14.015 --> 27:16.250
he's winning, and I'll never be free.

27:21.577 --> 27:23.817
Wherefore art thou, Romeo?

27:24.016 --> 27:26.653
Deny thy father and refuse thy name,

27:26.928 --> 27:30.036
or, if thou wilt not,
be but sworn my love,

27:30.099 --> 27:31.994
and I'll no longer be a Capulet.

27:32.133 --> 27:33.880
Don't judge me, don't cast me out!

27:33.955 --> 27:36.390
Hear me out! Show... me out.

27:36.892 --> 27:38.365
Show me out of this void.

28:09.910 --> 28:11.044
Bullshit.

28:13.234 --> 28:15.135
Not going after any career night.

28:22.236 --> 28:24.238
Here! Over here.

29:33.774 --> 29:36.310
All right. Ticket?

29:39.669 --> 29:40.735
Thank you.

29:40.774 --> 29:41.976
You're welcome.

29:43.366 --> 29:45.265
Just lift the blanket.
Let me get a quick look here.

29:45.290 --> 29:47.057
Oh, of course, of course.

29:52.627 --> 29:53.761
Thank you.

29:53.835 --> 29:55.625
You're welcome.

29:56.213 --> 29:57.606
Next.

30:28.202 --> 30:30.403
Oh, I'm so glad we got to see this one.

30:38.779 --> 30:40.876
I said get out!

30:41.268 --> 30:44.293
Well, am I in danger right now?

30:44.395 --> 30:46.329
Just go to your son's house!

30:46.460 --> 30:49.505
Oh. He's kind of a bore.

30:49.550 --> 30:51.302
For God's sake, Ida, be bored!

30:51.328 --> 30:52.829
It's better than the alternative!

30:53.094 --> 30:54.628
Oh. Is it, really?

30:56.440 --> 30:57.657
For Christ's sake...

30:57.685 --> 30:59.098
And how am I supposed to go anywhere?

30:59.123 --> 31:01.524
- You're in my car.
- Well, call a cab.

31:01.589 --> 31:03.623
You're a great woman for giving advice.

31:03.777 --> 31:05.378
Just take it, for once!

31:18.518 --> 31:19.929
You guys got issued a picture.

31:19.954 --> 31:21.822
There he is. I think he's here.

31:22.490 --> 31:24.218
He's pretty dangerous.
Keep your eye out, all right?

31:24.243 --> 31:26.142
Got it.

31:27.120 --> 31:28.228
Arms out.

31:30.750 --> 31:32.569
Okay. Enjoy the show.

32:13.327 --> 32:14.461
Good evening.

32:14.569 --> 32:15.654
Good evening.

32:15.680 --> 32:17.234
Well, if you're here tonight,

32:17.259 --> 32:20.204
you're part of a very
special group... donors.

32:24.671 --> 32:26.472
We like money!

32:29.563 --> 32:31.736
But, seriously, you are
part of a special group.

32:31.780 --> 32:35.562
You're donors to this...
the Edmund Mills Art Center.

32:41.680 --> 32:44.692
This is a testament to...
to your excitement

32:44.717 --> 32:46.651
about arts in our community,

32:46.708 --> 32:48.152
arts in our school

32:48.445 --> 32:50.438
at a time when
it's not really important

32:50.471 --> 32:51.737
to a lot of people.

32:51.817 --> 32:53.957
But it is to us, and I thank...

32:54.015 --> 32:56.082
I really thank each
and every one of you.

32:56.263 --> 32:58.171
It's a very important
thing that you've done.

32:58.196 --> 32:59.597
I celebrate you.

33:04.869 --> 33:06.802
So good to see you here.

33:25.811 --> 33:27.237
Wait. Hold on.

33:31.397 --> 33:32.671
Thank you.

34:06.945 --> 34:08.087
Are you okay?

34:08.112 --> 34:09.208
Yeah, yeah, I'm grand.

34:09.234 --> 34:10.599
Well, you... you look terrible.

34:10.623 --> 34:11.875
I've been trying to call you.

34:11.900 --> 34:13.315
Well, I... I shut my phone off.

34:13.340 --> 34:14.350
Why?

34:14.400 --> 34:16.300
Because I do not want to speak
with my mother.

34:16.369 --> 34:17.902
So don't answer her calls.

34:18.137 --> 34:19.619
But that's rude.

34:19.665 --> 34:20.965
You got to get out of here.

34:21.333 --> 34:22.509
Wait. Why?

34:22.542 --> 34:23.775
I think he's here.

34:23.801 --> 34:24.773
Wait. He's alive?

34:24.797 --> 34:27.326
I think he could be anywhere
people I care about are.

34:27.875 --> 34:28.898
But...

34:28.922 --> 34:31.525
So you're implying
I'm someone you care about?

34:31.550 --> 34:34.481
In a paternalistic sense, yes.
You've got to go, please.

34:34.505 --> 34:35.871
Well, but if the feeling were mutual,

34:35.897 --> 34:36.978
then why would I leave you?

34:37.003 --> 34:38.771
For God's sake, will you go?!

34:39.324 --> 34:41.388
Well, Jerome is about
to speak in there.

34:41.487 --> 34:43.998
Get him and his family out of here now!

34:44.024 --> 34:46.592
O-Okay.

35:02.335 --> 35:05.918
[Cheers and applause

35:05.943 --> 35:09.416
I'm here tonight to introduce
a very, very special young man.

35:10.376 --> 35:12.732
And, by the way, if there's
a 17-year-old in town

35:12.757 --> 35:15.191
 that could run against me and win...

35:15.454 --> 35:17.651
it's this guy.

35:17.697 --> 35:19.930
So I'm glad that you're
going off to college, son.

35:21.280 --> 35:23.838
He's the first in a generation
to get into Harvard.

35:26.315 --> 35:27.461
Yeah!

35:27.486 --> 35:28.753
The first in five years

35:28.778 --> 35:30.783
to be admitted into
the National Honor Society.

35:40.152 --> 35:41.487
Excuse me.

35:46.646 --> 35:48.314
Excuse me.

35:59.251 --> 36:00.786
Brady?

36:02.922 --> 36:04.656
Should've worn sunglasses.

36:04.991 --> 36:06.558
Wait, wait!

36:06.766 --> 36:08.887
Aah! Aah!

36:09.014 --> 36:10.554
Aah!

36:37.943 --> 36:39.490
Mr. Jerome Robinson.

36:48.313 --> 36:49.953
Thank you, Mayor.

36:50.162 --> 36:51.762
And... And thank you all

36:51.787 --> 36:53.946
for supporting
the Edmund Mills Art Center.

36:53.971 --> 36:55.838
This is becoming the cornerstone

36:55.863 --> 36:57.998
of the revitalization of downtown.

36:58.143 --> 36:59.445
So thank you for being here,

36:59.470 --> 37:02.904
and thank you for donating
and joining us here.

37:11.544 --> 37:13.810
Tonight you've seen incredible
artists, musicians,

37:13.835 --> 37:16.636
dancers, poets, painters...
you name it.

37:17.109 --> 37:18.977
Tonight, we're gonna watch

37:19.031 --> 37:21.136
the Bridgton Middle School Choir
perform.

37:21.200 --> 37:22.315
So, ladies and gentlemen,

37:22.340 --> 37:24.822
please give it up for the
Bridgton Middle School Choir.

37:24.921 --> 37:26.021
Yes.

37:30.617 --> 37:32.285
Whoo!

37:43.390 --> 37:44.990
Help me.

37:45.811 --> 37:47.279
Help me!

37:48.727 --> 37:50.601
Help me! Help me!

37:50.756 --> 37:53.825
Help me! Help me! Somebody help me!

37:57.349 --> 37:58.479
Help me!

38:07.073 --> 38:08.106
Help me.

38:08.154 --> 38:09.788
Call a medic, quickly!

38:10.025 --> 38:11.245
Help!

38:11.270 --> 38:12.285
All right.

38:20.630 --> 38:21.823
It's Brady.

38:21.848 --> 38:23.315
Here. H-Hold this to the wound.

38:24.287 --> 38:25.714
It's... It's Brady.

38:25.872 --> 38:27.673
It's Brady Hartsfield.

38:27.853 --> 38:29.320
Please...

38:29.361 --> 38:30.448
Where? Where is he?

38:30.473 --> 38:31.740
He's in a wheelchair.

38:31.765 --> 38:33.966
Please don't leave me here.

38:33.991 --> 38:35.501
I don't want to die here!

38:35.526 --> 38:37.104
You're not gonna die, all right?

38:37.129 --> 38:39.130
Just hold this to stem the bleeding.

38:39.155 --> 38:40.555
It's all gonna be fine.

38:40.860 --> 38:42.060
You see which way he went?

38:42.121 --> 38:43.455
Sir, I got this.

38:44.142 --> 38:46.601
Wait. He's got... He shaved his head.

38:47.043 --> 38:48.143
Ow.

38:48.168 --> 38:49.401
He shaved his head.

38:49.712 --> 38:50.922
He wh... He what?

38:51.531 --> 38:53.040
Shaved his... Shaved his head?

38:53.065 --> 38:54.932
Got a shaved head.

38:55.107 --> 38:57.547
Just don't let him come back here.

38:57.669 --> 39:00.805
Please don't let him come back here!

40:20.858 --> 40:22.584
- Jerome, I just saw Hodges.
- Yeah.

40:22.609 --> 40:24.067
I just saw Hodges.
He said that Brady's here.

40:24.092 --> 40:25.164
You got to get everyone out of here.

40:25.189 --> 40:26.247
Wait, wait. Slow down. What now?

40:26.272 --> 40:27.580
I just saw Hodges.
Get everyone out of here!

40:27.605 --> 40:28.960
- Go, go, go, go!
- You said Brady's here?

40:28.985 --> 40:30.016
Yes, go.

40:31.761 --> 40:33.543
Hey, guys, go this way. Everybody, out!

40:33.579 --> 40:34.756
Get back.

40:35.927 --> 40:37.386
Everybody, down!

40:39.224 --> 40:40.252
Everybody, down!

40:40.320 --> 40:43.154
Freeze!

40:43.213 --> 40:44.300
Get down, get down! Get down!

40:44.325 --> 40:45.325
Freeze!

41:07.606 --> 41:09.073
Mike Sturdivant?

41:59.424 --> 42:01.892
...responsible for the
capture and arrest

42:01.917 --> 42:03.790
of the infamous Mercedes killer

42:03.863 --> 42:05.447
when they stepped in to stop him

42:05.472 --> 42:07.427
from committing another atrocious act.

42:13.759 --> 42:16.165
How long is the drive?

42:17.015 --> 42:18.215
It's about 10 hours.

42:18.504 --> 42:19.703
Oof.

42:19.728 --> 42:21.596
Yeah.

42:25.418 --> 42:27.155
So...

42:28.260 --> 42:31.004
What you got going on today?

42:31.563 --> 42:34.219
Well... I...

42:34.440 --> 42:36.612
They're coming in for me
in a few minutes.

42:37.930 --> 42:39.965
Get me on my feet...

42:39.991 --> 42:42.091
just a little walk
up and down the corridor,

42:42.116 --> 42:43.565
so that's really good.

42:44.198 --> 42:45.218
Yeah.

42:45.243 --> 42:46.659
- Yeah?
- That is good.

42:48.908 --> 42:50.376
Yep.

42:53.459 --> 42:55.261
Yep.

43:00.238 --> 43:02.306
It's a long drive.

43:05.651 --> 43:08.453
Yeah, it's a long drive.

43:10.435 --> 43:11.736
Yeah.

43:14.307 --> 43:16.603
Your future awaits.

43:34.997 --> 43:36.665
Thanks, Bill.

43:37.136 --> 43:39.132
Drive safe.

43:39.711 --> 43:41.245
Yeah, I'll try.

46:27.846 --> 46:29.913
This is it, Kermit William.

46:30.188 --> 46:32.142
You're busting out of here in the A.M.

46:32.170 --> 46:33.571
You shit me not?

46:34.053 --> 46:35.835
I shit you not.

46:37.459 --> 46:40.264
I'll take care of this,
and I'll be back for those.

46:40.862 --> 46:42.125
Thanks, Al.

47:33.238 --> 47:35.106
Can I pop in here a second?

47:37.062 --> 47:38.229
Is the doctor in?

47:38.254 --> 47:39.723
In with him now.

47:39.910 --> 47:41.531
Okay. Thanks.

47:41.673 --> 47:43.141
Thanks.

47:51.436 --> 47:53.396
Hey.

47:54.733 --> 47:56.467
You're leaving today, I hear.

47:56.628 --> 47:59.382
That mean you're gonna stop
coming in here to stare at him?

48:01.493 --> 48:03.262
Unlikely.

48:04.656 --> 48:08.225
The path leading up to the front
of this hospital is brick.

48:08.687 --> 48:11.748
Hunch down and stare at those
bricks on your way out.

48:11.849 --> 48:14.181
They'll communicate better
than he will, Mr. Hodges.

48:14.259 --> 48:15.581
He's gone.

48:19.505 --> 48:20.805
Never coming back?

48:20.959 --> 48:22.840
No.

48:23.029 --> 48:25.497
His brain has the same
electromagnetic level

48:25.522 --> 48:28.759
as a triple-A battery you left
in a remote five years ago.

48:33.552 --> 48:36.454
If I whack that remote enough,

48:36.515 --> 48:39.383
I'll get the TV running, I promise you.

48:39.410 --> 48:41.849
If somebody whacks him
one more time, he'll die.

48:45.530 --> 48:47.554
Care to take a coffee break, Doc?

48:47.719 --> 48:49.521
Be like I was never here.

48:51.270 --> 48:53.804
If he ever flatlines,
I hope you have an alibi.

48:53.912 --> 48:57.616
If he ever flatlines, I'll show
up and cremate him myself.

48:59.571 --> 49:01.138
You think I'm joking.

49:02.113 --> 49:05.050
Sadly, I don't.

49:08.231 --> 49:10.128
I'll just be a second here.

49:30.281 --> 49:33.244
I know you're in there...

49:33.698 --> 49:36.538
because hate hangs on...

49:36.792 --> 49:39.211
and hate's all you had.

49:42.092 --> 49:43.949
Could bring you back someday.

49:48.133 --> 49:51.169
Sure as taxes and Christmas, though,

49:51.350 --> 49:54.219
I'll be waiting...

49:54.632 --> 49:57.234
and I'll finish it.

50:06.664 --> 50:09.466
Nurse Farrell, you
are needed in Pediatrics.

50:09.491 --> 50:12.328
Nurse Farrell, you are
needed in Pediatrics.
