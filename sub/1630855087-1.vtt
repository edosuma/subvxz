00:39.000 --> 00:42.250
<i>Perhaps you've read
the story of Quasimodo,</i>

00:42.250 --> 00:44.958
<i>the monstrous bell-ringer of Notre-Dame.</i>

00:45.458 --> 00:47.500
<i>But more likely, you haven't,</i>

00:47.500 --> 00:52.333
<i>because who still reads about
medieval France and all that bullshit?</i>

00:54.958 --> 00:56.166
<i>Well, don't worry,</i>

00:56.166 --> 01:00.416
<i>because we're gonna tell you
the story of the real Quasimodo.</i>

01:02.666 --> 01:06.916
<i>All you need to know
is that 13th-century France sucked.</i>

01:06.916 --> 01:11.500
<i>It was a time of plague, poverty
and torture chambers,</i>

01:11.500 --> 01:16.916
<i>where one often found themselves
impaled by dangerous objects.</i>

01:20.083 --> 01:23.583
<i>Unless you were a king
who could just dismiss your wife</i>

01:23.583 --> 01:25.125
<i>when you tired of her...</i>

01:27.833 --> 01:33.875
<i>or a pope humbly entrusted
with the sacred offerings of his flock.</i>

01:36.291 --> 01:41.333
<i>And the last thing you'd want is to get
trapped between these two powerful pricks,</i>

01:41.333 --> 01:45.208
<i>which is exactly
where Quasimodo found himself,</i>

01:46.000 --> 01:49.041
<i>an ill-advised place for a nobody.</i>

01:49.791 --> 01:52.833
<i>In fact, he's quite fucked.</i>

01:53.750 --> 01:56.541
<i>And this is his story.</i>

02:03.333 --> 02:04.333
<i>Quasi!</i>

02:05.666 --> 02:06.666
<i>Quasi!</i>

02:07.416 --> 02:12.708
Quasi! Quasi! Quasi! Quasi!

02:13.416 --> 02:15.583
Quasi! Quasi.

02:16.666 --> 02:19.166
Holy shit. What is your problem?

02:19.166 --> 02:20.458
Come on. We're gonna be late.

02:20.458 --> 02:22.041
We are not gonna be late.

02:22.041 --> 02:25.500
When you grow up in a bell tower,
you have a knack for keeping time.

02:25.500 --> 02:26.916
You with your bell towers.

02:26.916 --> 02:28.625
- Yeah.
- Hey, slow down.

02:28.625 --> 02:30.791
- Oh, now you want me to slow down?
- Yeah. Slow down. Come on.

02:30.791 --> 02:33.750
- You're the one who's in such a rush.
- Let's walk together, huh? Like friends.

02:34.416 --> 02:35.666
It's a great morning.

02:35.666 --> 02:38.750
It's springtime. The flowers are in bloom.

02:38.750 --> 02:41.083
The air smells of peat and sweet cloth.

02:41.083 --> 02:43.000
Whatever. I'll take your word for it.

02:43.000 --> 02:44.333
Aw, why so crispy, huh?

02:45.458 --> 02:47.166
Hunchback.

02:47.166 --> 02:49.708
Hey, you know what your problem is?

02:49.708 --> 02:53.250
Is it that I've got a fatty deposit
the size of a giant gourd on my back?

02:53.250 --> 02:55.791
No. It's that you've given up on humanity.

02:55.791 --> 02:57.375
You have given up on love.

02:57.375 --> 03:00.708
Duchamp, you can't give up
on something you've never had.

03:00.708 --> 03:02.250
Well, I'm no soothsayer,

03:02.250 --> 03:06.333
but I think this is the springtime where
things turn around for my little buddy.

03:06.333 --> 03:08.000
- Weirdo!
- Freak!

03:09.250 --> 03:10.333
Morning.

03:13.583 --> 03:15.791
Hey, "Pope Week."

03:15.791 --> 03:17.416
"The coronation of the new queen."

03:17.416 --> 03:18.791
These are exciting times.

03:18.791 --> 03:20.583
Remind me to buy
more papal lottery tickets.

03:20.583 --> 03:23.750
Oh, come on, Du. Don't waste your money.
Nobody wins those things.

03:23.750 --> 03:25.958
Somebody's gotta win.
Why can't it be me?

03:25.958 --> 03:27.916
Confession with the pope.

03:27.916 --> 03:30.416
- Du, you're being ridiculous.
<i>Croissant!</i>

03:30.416 --> 03:31.833
Hey. <i>Croissant?</i>

03:31.833 --> 03:33.041
<i>Non.</i>

03:33.041 --> 03:34.333
-<i>Croissant?</i>
-<i>Non.</i>

03:34.333 --> 03:35.958
- Come on. <i>Croissant?</i>
-<i>Non.</i>

03:35.958 --> 03:37.291
<i>Croissant?</i>

03:37.291 --> 03:38.625
No!

03:38.625 --> 03:39.833
<i>Deux croissants.</i>

03:39.833 --> 03:41.083
I said I didn't want one.

03:41.083 --> 03:42.416
They're both for me.

03:42.416 --> 03:45.166
Hey! Eat shit, asshole!

03:45.166 --> 03:46.250
Good morning, officer.

03:46.250 --> 03:47.333
<i>Croissant?</i>

03:48.333 --> 03:50.041
Why don't you duck
when they throw stuff at you?

03:50.041 --> 03:52.416
- What do you mean? I'm already ducked.
- I guess that's a good point.

03:54.583 --> 03:57.041
Back to the daily grind.

04:04.000 --> 04:06.083
Repent for your sins!

04:08.125 --> 04:09.375
Hey, Pascal.

04:09.375 --> 04:10.916
Hey! Good morning, Du.

04:10.916 --> 04:12.000
Good morning, Quasi.

04:13.333 --> 04:15.041
Stefan, how was that date?

04:15.041 --> 04:16.333
<i>Incroyable!</i>

04:16.333 --> 04:19.041
And things got very romantic.

04:20.250 --> 04:21.583
- You devil.
- Yeah.

04:21.583 --> 04:22.750
Matisse, what's up?

04:22.750 --> 04:24.958
Embrace your savior!

04:27.458 --> 04:29.791
No, it doesn't hurt that bad.

04:29.791 --> 04:31.208
Oh, Monday, Monday, right?

04:31.208 --> 04:32.291
Yep.

04:32.291 --> 04:34.291
Quasi, you're late.

04:34.291 --> 04:35.916
I know for a fact that I'm not.

04:35.916 --> 04:38.875
Oh, that's right. I forgot.
You grew up in a bell tower.

04:39.958 --> 04:42.083
Yeah, 'cause I grew up in a bell tower.

04:42.083 --> 04:43.541
Oh, you gonna take mouth with me?

04:43.541 --> 04:45.416
He gets me so mad sometimes.

04:45.416 --> 04:46.500
Don't get worked up.

04:46.500 --> 04:49.708
Fucker's gonna start with me on a--
on a fuckin' Monday of all things.

04:49.708 --> 04:53.083
Hey, you may think you're hot gruel
'cause you invented that rack,

04:53.083 --> 04:55.500
but around here,
you're just another monkey wrench.

04:55.500 --> 04:56.875
Remember your place, Hunchback.

04:56.875 --> 04:58.083
Settle down, Lucien.

04:58.083 --> 04:59.500
I'm sure the king wouldn't wanna hear

04:59.500 --> 05:03.250
that Quasi was bringing his rack
somewhere else, like <i>Espagne</i>.

05:03.250 --> 05:04.375
Michel!

05:05.083 --> 05:07.000
- Why do you let that guy push you around?
- I don't know.

05:07.000 --> 05:08.791
- Don't let him push you around.
- I know.

05:08.791 --> 05:11.958
Dipshits, this is Michel,
your new guinea pig.

05:11.958 --> 05:13.875
You're gonna be torturing him
for the next couple weeks.

05:13.875 --> 05:15.416
- Get down there, shorty.

05:16.833 --> 05:18.166
Hey. Look at this little guy.

05:19.333 --> 05:20.625
-<i>Bonjour. Bonjour.</i>
-<i>Bonjour.</i>

05:20.625 --> 05:21.750
<i>Bonjour.</i>

05:21.750 --> 05:23.666
-<i>Bonjour.</i>

05:23.666 --> 05:24.750
- Oh.

05:24.750 --> 05:26.958
Hey, go easy on this one.
He's your third this month.

05:26.958 --> 05:29.750
See if you can keep
his arms attached to his body.

05:29.750 --> 05:31.208
- Don't worry about it.
- Never happen.

05:31.208 --> 05:32.500
All right. Back to work.

05:32.500 --> 05:35.416
Hey,
more fire ants in that guy's dick hole.

05:35.416 --> 05:37.250
All right, Michel.
You ready to get tortured?

05:37.250 --> 05:38.916
- Yes, sir!
- Yeah, come on up.

05:38.916 --> 05:41.166
There you go.
This isn't too bad.

05:41.166 --> 05:43.166
- Get yourself comfortable.
- Ooh, this is nice.

05:43.750 --> 05:45.958
- Come on in here.
- Okay. Here we go.

05:45.958 --> 05:47.583
My God,
his feet don't each even reach the end.

05:47.583 --> 05:48.791
- Come on.
- That's good.

05:48.791 --> 05:50.375
- Get the arms up here.
- Ah.

05:50.375 --> 05:51.833
There we go.

05:51.833 --> 05:54.000
- All right. How are you? You okay?
- Good.

05:54.000 --> 05:55.416
We're gonna start easy.

05:55.416 --> 05:57.000
First time working in the torture chamber?

05:57.000 --> 05:59.458
Yep. Just making a couple extra francs
for culinary school.

05:59.458 --> 06:01.041
Oh, a chef! Good for you.

06:01.041 --> 06:02.500
- Yeah.
- Okay, straps too tight?

06:02.500 --> 06:03.833
No. Go as tight as you need.

06:03.833 --> 06:06.541
You got a real can-do attitude.
I like that, Michel.

06:06.541 --> 06:08.416
I actually can't believe
you pay people to do this.

06:08.416 --> 06:11.291
Huh, well, we used to test the devices
on real heretics,

06:11.291 --> 06:13.500
but those guys said everything hurt.

06:13.500 --> 06:14.750
- Am I right?
- Heretics.

06:14.750 --> 06:16.250
- Heretics.
- Heretics.

06:16.916 --> 06:18.625
Ow. Oh!

06:18.625 --> 06:20.458
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

06:20.458 --> 06:22.666
The first time can be
a bit of a shock to the system.

06:23.250 --> 06:24.500
That's okay.

06:24.500 --> 06:25.916
So you guys psyched for Pope Week?

06:25.916 --> 06:27.041
Oh, my God. Here we go.

06:27.041 --> 06:28.875
- Another Pope Week guy.
- Pope Week? I love Pope Week.

06:32.583 --> 06:35.458
Thank you for coming here
on this beautiful day.

06:35.458 --> 06:38.041
And on behalf of Pope Cornelius...

06:42.125 --> 06:44.708
...bless you for
the indulgences you've bought.

06:44.708 --> 06:47.541
This will save you in the eyes of God.

06:48.625 --> 06:52.625
Now, who wants to see an exorcism?

06:56.833 --> 06:58.458
Care to participate, Your Grace?

06:58.458 --> 06:59.375
Christ, Claude.

06:59.375 --> 07:01.791
Just give these mouth-breathers
what they want.

07:03.958 --> 07:08.708
May the Lord extend his peaceful hand
upon all of you.

07:08.708 --> 07:10.833
And also with you.

07:10.833 --> 07:12.208
Now split that bitch.

07:13.000 --> 07:14.000
Brother Giuseppe.

07:14.583 --> 07:16.208
Thanks be to God, Your Grace.

07:18.541 --> 07:22.125
Be gone, foul behezrahoth!

07:22.125 --> 07:23.875
- Would you mind?

07:26.458 --> 07:28.375
No, no, no, no. No, no, please!

07:28.375 --> 07:29.375
- No!

07:30.416 --> 07:32.416
What is this papal visit next week?

07:32.416 --> 07:33.500
France.

07:33.500 --> 07:38.125
The French are pigs.
They all stink and eat garbage.

07:38.125 --> 07:41.708
And the royals,
always marrying their own family.

07:41.708 --> 07:44.083
They all have 11 fingers
and never stop bleeding.

07:44.083 --> 07:46.041
They're all disgusting, my lord.

07:46.041 --> 07:48.916
Goddamn,
how I hate that pompous ass, King Guy.

07:48.916 --> 07:50.375
Postpone it.

07:50.375 --> 07:53.083
It's scheduled with
the coronation of the new queen.

07:53.083 --> 07:54.250
- New queen?
Mmm.

07:54.250 --> 07:56.416
I told him he wasn't allowed
to divorce his first wife.

07:56.416 --> 07:59.458
He had her killed. A bit of a work-around.

07:59.458 --> 08:01.583
Now he's married his English cousin.

08:02.666 --> 08:06.375
The new union will form a powerful
alliance between France and England.

08:06.375 --> 08:08.666
Oh, he'll be even more insufferable.

08:08.666 --> 08:10.125
Damn you, Satan!

08:12.041 --> 08:14.541
Goddamn it. This will never come off.

08:17.458 --> 08:20.291
Say,
have you heard the joke about the bed?

08:20.291 --> 08:21.458
No.

08:21.458 --> 08:23.666
It hasn't been made yet.

08:42.458 --> 08:45.500
Say,
have you heard the joke about the cookie?

08:45.500 --> 08:46.875
No.

08:46.875 --> 08:48.083
It's crummy.

08:56.250 --> 08:57.500
Guards!

08:58.166 --> 09:00.541
Boil my jester in oil.

09:01.125 --> 09:02.208
No, no!

09:02.208 --> 09:06.958
- No, no. No! No. No!
Come on.

09:07.541 --> 09:08.666
No!

09:10.625 --> 09:12.250
- Good morning, my king.

09:12.250 --> 09:16.458
Breakfast today is wine from
the Rhône valley and fresh Belon oysters.

09:16.458 --> 09:20.416
And where do your oysters come from,
my pet?

09:20.416 --> 09:22.291
Your Highness,
we have a very busy day today.

09:23.375 --> 09:26.041
Oh. Hello.

09:35.625 --> 09:37.375
Good morning, milady.

09:37.375 --> 09:38.916
Good morning, Henri-Francoise.

09:42.333 --> 09:43.750
As I was saying, sire,

09:43.750 --> 09:47.375
we have a meeting with the tax collectors
to discuss the springtime levies.

09:47.375 --> 09:49.875
And, of course, we have to prepare
for the arrival of the pope.

09:49.875 --> 09:52.250
Oh, Cornelius?

09:52.250 --> 09:54.916
I hate that Gorgonzola-eating bastard.

09:54.916 --> 09:56.666
My liege, if you hate the pope,

09:56.666 --> 10:02.166
why not fabricate a papal decree demanding
a 200% increase in tithes from the people?

10:02.750 --> 10:05.333
Your outraged subjects will run him
right out of the country.

10:05.333 --> 10:07.250
Well, look at that, Henri-Francoise.

10:07.916 --> 10:12.375
My new ornament wishes to discuss
the affairs of France.

10:12.375 --> 10:14.291
Yes.

10:14.291 --> 10:16.291
How <i>adorable</i>.

10:16.291 --> 10:17.791
- My liege.
- Leave us.

10:18.375 --> 10:21.291
Sire, as queen,
is it not my duty to suggest--

10:21.291 --> 10:22.208
Leave us!

10:23.708 --> 10:24.750
As you wish.

10:28.000 --> 10:29.000
My queen.

10:34.500 --> 10:37.666
I was not told
she was going to speak so much.

10:37.666 --> 10:40.791
- She's a regular smarty <i>pantalons</i>.

10:40.791 --> 10:44.416
Indeed, but a small price to pay
for a powerful alliance.

10:44.416 --> 10:48.750
A rather large price to pay for someone
who never wanted to be married again.

10:48.750 --> 10:50.125
Yes, well.

10:50.125 --> 10:54.875
But do look into that
phony-papal-decree idea, because why not?

10:54.875 --> 10:56.875
Excellent idea, Your Highness.

10:57.458 --> 10:58.541
Enjoy your oysters.

10:59.708 --> 11:00.791
Bring me some salt!

11:03.916 --> 11:05.333
I need some salt!

11:10.333 --> 11:12.291
- Hey! All right. Just stop!
Move it!

11:12.291 --> 11:13.583
- Stop!
All right.

11:13.583 --> 11:15.875
Okay. Don't have to be so rough.

11:15.875 --> 11:18.125
Hey, uh, why are the oysters up there?

11:18.125 --> 11:20.083
Oh, it's the food of kings.

11:20.083 --> 11:22.125
Lucien thinks it displays superiority.

11:22.125 --> 11:24.333
You know what he should do
is get better oysters.

11:24.333 --> 11:26.083
I mean, those are crap.

11:26.083 --> 11:27.750
- Belon oysters...

11:27.750 --> 11:28.833
...that's the food of kings.

11:28.833 --> 11:30.500
Oh, you've had Belon oysters?

11:30.500 --> 11:31.791
Once, when I was a boy.

11:31.791 --> 11:35.375
It was like they were lifted from the sea
by nautical angels.

11:42.333 --> 11:44.916
Okay,
that was 15% torque on the upper straps.

11:44.916 --> 11:47.458
- Michel, go on about the oysters.

11:47.458 --> 11:48.583
Describe their taste.

11:48.583 --> 11:51.916
Crisp, clean, salty.

11:51.916 --> 11:54.916
- Aw, that sounds <i>fantastique</i>.

11:54.916 --> 11:56.791
Hey, enough with the chatter down there.

11:57.875 --> 12:02.583
You know, if I was king,
there'd be Belon oysters on every table.

12:04.000 --> 12:05.250
A king for the people.

12:05.250 --> 12:07.666
That's a good one, you weird little loser.

12:07.666 --> 12:08.750
Now get back to work.

12:10.791 --> 12:15.583
Has Lucien ever shared his oysters
with anyone here?

12:15.583 --> 12:17.166
No!

12:17.166 --> 12:21.750
If he's gonna eat oysters in front of us,
shouldn't he bring enough for everybody?

12:21.750 --> 12:22.958
<i>Oui!</i>

12:22.958 --> 12:25.333
Hey, you know what?
Put a sock in it, Quasi.

12:26.708 --> 12:29.791
Oysters! Oysters! Oysters!

12:29.791 --> 12:33.875
Oysters! Oysters! Oysters! Oysters!

12:33.875 --> 12:42.500
Oysters! Oysters! Oysters! Oysters!

12:42.500 --> 12:44.916
- Shut up! All of you!

12:44.916 --> 12:46.000
All right.

12:46.000 --> 12:48.250
You want oysters?
I'll give you oysters up--

12:48.250 --> 12:49.416
My queen.

12:52.166 --> 12:53.333
Oysters.

12:53.333 --> 12:57.291
Your Highness, may I ask what brings you
to our, uh, humble place of work?

12:58.208 --> 13:02.083
It's a queen's duty to familiarize herself
with all aspects of the kingdom.

13:02.083 --> 13:03.333
I should like a tour.

13:03.333 --> 13:04.708
Of course, Your Majesty.

13:05.458 --> 13:09.416
Would be my privilege
to escort you around the premises.

13:10.125 --> 13:13.333
Perhaps it would be best for me
to receive it from your superior.

13:14.625 --> 13:15.708
That one.

13:18.041 --> 13:19.375
Holy shit. She's pointing at me.

13:19.375 --> 13:21.000
Yeah, right.

13:21.000 --> 13:23.333
- Shut up. Shut up. Don't joke.
- I'm-- I'm serious.

13:23.333 --> 13:27.958
Uh, begging your pardon, my queen, but
that torturer is in no way my superior.

13:27.958 --> 13:30.125
The way he speaks to you
tells me otherwise.

13:35.250 --> 13:37.000
- She's coming downstairs.
- Oh, my God.

13:37.000 --> 13:39.000
There's a queen coming down here now.

13:42.250 --> 13:43.250
- Don't look at her.
- Okay.

13:43.250 --> 13:44.875
- Don't look.
- It's hard. She's really hot.

13:44.875 --> 13:47.333
Oh, my God.
I can't believe she's coming down here.

13:51.833 --> 13:53.750
Oh, my.

13:54.375 --> 13:57.000
Smell is exceptionally rancid down here.

13:58.666 --> 14:00.375
Torturer, stand.

14:01.375 --> 14:02.791
Mmm.

14:03.375 --> 14:05.750
You seem to have the ear
of your fellow workers.

14:05.750 --> 14:09.250
I am just a humble subject of the king, milady.

14:09.250 --> 14:10.750
Raise your head, torturer.

14:16.833 --> 14:17.916
What is it you do here?

14:17.916 --> 14:19.583
I work this machine.

14:20.916 --> 14:23.583
Is this not the rack I hear so much about?

14:24.083 --> 14:25.500
'Tis, my queen. 'Tis.

14:26.000 --> 14:27.083
Hmm.

14:27.083 --> 14:31.000
How is it that you were chosen to man
the king's most effective torture device?

14:31.000 --> 14:32.708
I invented it, milady.

14:32.708 --> 14:34.333
You invented it?

14:34.333 --> 14:37.375
Yeah, in an attempt to straighten my back,

14:37.375 --> 14:41.458
but it didn't quite unfold
as I had wished.

14:44.041 --> 14:47.333
Smart and witty.
Seems you are very talented.

14:47.333 --> 14:49.375
You are too kind, my queen.

14:49.375 --> 14:53.750
Perhaps you'd have more success
if you adjusted the flywheel.

14:53.750 --> 14:56.083
Say, 20 degrees?

14:56.083 --> 14:59.958
Then you'd have the benefits of both
horizontal tension and vertical tension.

14:59.958 --> 15:02.000
Uh, okay. Yeah!

15:02.500 --> 15:05.250
That is a brilliant observation, my queen.

15:05.250 --> 15:07.083
I will implement that immediately.

15:07.083 --> 15:10.208
- You will?
- Yeah, "<i>absolutement</i>."

15:11.583 --> 15:14.458
Not only are you a good speaker
but a good listener.

15:14.458 --> 15:16.666
A unique combination, torturer...

15:17.250 --> 15:19.166
Modo. Quasi Modo.

15:20.583 --> 15:22.291
It's been a pleasure, Quasi.

15:22.291 --> 15:24.000
I very much like your rack.

15:24.000 --> 15:25.208
And I yours.

15:25.208 --> 15:26.958
I mean--

15:26.958 --> 15:30.000
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

15:30.000 --> 15:36.416
What I meant to say was I very much
appreciate all your suggestions, my queen.

15:36.416 --> 15:37.875
Of course.

15:37.875 --> 15:38.958
Carry on.

15:38.958 --> 15:40.166
Yeah. Yeah.

15:44.958 --> 15:46.208
Are you kidding me?

15:46.208 --> 15:47.125
Oh.

15:47.125 --> 15:48.458
That was crazy!

15:48.458 --> 15:50.000
Oh, my God.

16:00.750 --> 16:02.500
All right. It's really good.

16:03.000 --> 16:05.416
Yeah. Okay. Hold on. Hold on. A toast.

16:05.416 --> 16:07.875
Here is to our new friend, Michel.

16:08.375 --> 16:09.666
Hear, hear.

16:11.166 --> 16:14.333
I actually got you the job. Hmm?
You could've mentioned that.

16:14.333 --> 16:16.375
Du, I never had a chance.

16:16.375 --> 16:17.625
Seems like you forgot.

16:17.625 --> 16:18.708
Are we ignoring the fact that

16:18.708 --> 16:21.666
there was definitely sexual tension
between you and the queen?

16:21.666 --> 16:23.916
- What?

16:23.916 --> 16:25.000
The new guy.

16:25.000 --> 16:28.583
That's ridiculous. She's the queen. Hello.

16:28.583 --> 16:30.250
Michel, let me explain something.

16:30.750 --> 16:34.458
The queen could have any dragon slayer,
wizard or chevalier in the kingdom.

16:34.458 --> 16:37.083
Why would she care about a twisted,
lonely weirdo?

16:37.083 --> 16:39.666
- Okay, that's a little harsh.
- I'm just making a point.

16:39.666 --> 16:41.666
Plenty of royals have kinky fetishes.

16:41.666 --> 16:43.625
Remember that king
that used to have sex with chickens?

16:43.625 --> 16:45.291
Chicken a la king? Yeah.

16:45.291 --> 16:46.916
- That would make him the chicken.

16:46.916 --> 16:48.833
Yeah. That does make me the chicken.

16:48.833 --> 16:50.083
Cluck, cluck, motherfucker.

16:50.083 --> 16:52.875
Michel, I am a loser.

16:52.875 --> 16:56.541
I have never known the touch of a woman,
and I never will.

16:56.541 --> 16:59.916
Don't be so hard on yourself.
The guys in the torture chamber like you.

16:59.916 --> 17:02.083
You got a loyal best friend
in Duchamp right here.

17:02.083 --> 17:03.750
Easy now, okay?

17:03.750 --> 17:06.541
We may be hut mates,
but we're not best friends.

17:06.541 --> 17:08.708
Yeah, those labels are kind of weird.

17:08.708 --> 17:10.250
What are we, schoolgirls?

17:13.291 --> 17:14.750
Who wants a drink?

17:14.750 --> 17:16.750
- Hey, Blouin, my friend.
- Duch!

17:16.750 --> 17:18.250
You still selling papal lottery tickets?

17:18.250 --> 17:20.458
Yeah, but I'll warn you.
I already have the winner.

17:20.458 --> 17:23.541
How could that be when I'm about to buy
the winning ticket?

17:23.541 --> 17:24.625
Okay.

17:24.625 --> 17:26.125
- Give me ten more!
- Ten more.

17:26.125 --> 17:28.333
- Du, why are you wasting your money?

17:28.333 --> 17:30.500
I'm about to win
an audience with the pope.

17:30.500 --> 17:31.791
Right.

17:31.791 --> 17:33.750
And on the night of her coronation,

17:33.750 --> 17:36.458
I'm gonna make dirty love
to the queen in the rack.

17:40.375 --> 17:42.250
You can get executed for even saying that.

17:56.750 --> 17:58.333
Did you change something?
You look different.

17:58.333 --> 17:59.500
Me?

17:59.500 --> 18:01.333
- Your hair maybe?
- My hair? No.

18:01.333 --> 18:03.625
- Did you get taller?
- I wish.

18:05.458 --> 18:07.500
Hey, has the lottery drawing happened?

18:07.500 --> 18:09.000
Do you see me on that stage yet?

18:11.125 --> 18:16.125
On behalf of King Guy XXIV,
welcome to the papal lottery.

18:17.916 --> 18:22.333
A preliminary and lesser event leading up
to the coronation of your new queen.

18:32.083 --> 18:33.250
Winner of the lottery

18:33.250 --> 18:36.500
shall have his private confession heard
by the pope himself.

18:36.500 --> 18:39.041
Yes. You.

18:40.250 --> 18:42.916
Quasi, it's not too late. You can buy
tickets right up to the drawing.

18:42.916 --> 18:45.333
Take it from
the unluckiest person in France,

18:45.333 --> 18:47.333
you might as well
throw your money in a hole.

18:51.125 --> 18:52.208
You know what?

18:52.208 --> 18:54.750
Here. Take this. Consider it a gift.

18:54.750 --> 18:56.041
I don't want a gift.

18:56.041 --> 18:57.541
Please. I insist.

18:57.541 --> 18:59.750
Du,
don't act like this is such a big thing.

18:59.750 --> 19:01.250
Take it. On me.

19:01.250 --> 19:03.250
All right. If I take this thing,
will you stop bugging me?

19:03.250 --> 19:05.708
- You got it.

19:05.708 --> 19:06.916
- Okay?
- Okay.

19:06.916 --> 19:08.875
- Great. Enjoy it.
- Thanks.

19:08.875 --> 19:10.708
- Hope you have a winner. Yeah, right.
- Yeah.

19:10.708 --> 19:14.333
Without further ado,
Simone, the number, please!

19:17.666 --> 19:20.416
And the winning number is:

19:20.416 --> 19:25.083
J, seven, two, two,

19:25.083 --> 19:27.375
four, six.

19:27.375 --> 19:29.833
Merde.

19:29.833 --> 19:31.583
Oh! Oh!

19:31.583 --> 19:36.416
That's me! It's me!

19:38.000 --> 19:39.416
You're a woman.

19:39.416 --> 19:41.458
The pope won't grant audience to a woman.

19:44.625 --> 19:47.583
Oh, my goodness gracious. Give me a break.

19:48.708 --> 19:50.083
All right, Simone. New number, please.

19:53.458 --> 19:57.458
- The new number: F, four, three...
- Oh. Oh.

19:57.458 --> 20:00.208
...three, three,

20:00.708 --> 20:02.208
one.

20:02.208 --> 20:04.750
Merde, merde, merde!

20:06.041 --> 20:08.166
F, four, three, three, three, one?

20:08.166 --> 20:09.250
No one?

20:09.250 --> 20:11.750
Quasi, you won.

20:11.750 --> 20:13.916
- Huh? What?
- Quasi, you won.

20:14.750 --> 20:15.750
I won?

20:15.750 --> 20:16.833
You won!

20:18.125 --> 20:19.250
Quasi's the winner!

20:19.833 --> 20:21.666
We got a winner here!
We got a winner here!

20:21.666 --> 20:23.791
- Quasi's the winner!

20:23.791 --> 20:25.000
Quasi, you won!

20:25.000 --> 20:26.458
Well, congratulations!

20:26.458 --> 20:27.791
Bring the lucky fellow up here.

20:28.958 --> 20:35.500
Quasi! Quasi! Quasi!
Quasi! Quasi! Quasi! Quasi!

20:36.083 --> 20:37.625
Quasi! Quasi!

20:37.625 --> 20:39.750
A woman and a hunchback.

20:39.750 --> 20:41.583
What's next? A Saxon?

20:44.083 --> 20:45.166
Simone, right?

20:45.166 --> 20:46.375
You're not Saxon, are you?

20:46.375 --> 20:47.791
No. Okay, right.

20:53.833 --> 20:56.625
Hey, I wanna be tortured by a superstar!

20:56.625 --> 20:58.666
Hop on up, Michel. Here.

21:00.750 --> 21:01.833
Get in here.

21:01.833 --> 21:05.583
Wow, it's so great you won!
I've never won anything in my life!

21:05.583 --> 21:06.708
Give it your all!

21:10.416 --> 21:13.041
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
What the hell's going on around here?

21:13.041 --> 21:14.541
I'll tell you what's going on.

21:14.541 --> 21:16.625
Oysters! Oysters!

21:16.625 --> 21:18.416
- Oysters!
Not again with the oysters!

21:18.416 --> 21:21.791
- Shut up!

21:23.250 --> 21:24.250
Silence!

21:25.875 --> 21:27.583
Oysters.

21:27.583 --> 21:30.125
The king wishes to meet the hunchback.

21:33.375 --> 21:35.208
You're gonna meet the pope and the king?

21:35.208 --> 21:37.375
Good fortune smiles upon you, my friend.

21:37.375 --> 21:38.958
Good thing I gave you my ticket.

21:38.958 --> 21:42.083
Oh, wait. No, Du, of course.
You should take the ticket. You bought it.

21:42.083 --> 21:44.500
No, no. It's cool.
I mean, I gave it to you, so...

21:44.500 --> 21:46.291
- Technically it's mine, but whatever...
- No, no, no.

21:46.291 --> 21:47.541
No, Du, take the ticket.

21:47.541 --> 21:48.708
I didn't even want this.

21:48.708 --> 21:51.541
Oh, no, no. You know what?
You take it. Have a good time.

21:51.541 --> 21:53.541
- Get me in the next one, okay?

21:53.541 --> 21:54.875
The king awaits!

21:55.458 --> 21:56.875
- Okay.

21:56.875 --> 21:59.041
- Are we cool?
- Totally cool, man. Have a good time.

21:59.041 --> 22:00.208
Okay, <i>merci</i>.

22:00.208 --> 22:01.208
Yeah. Quasi.

22:01.208 --> 22:03.875
Quasi! Quasi! Quasi!

22:03.875 --> 22:05.458
Give him one for the serfs!

22:05.458 --> 22:07.708
I'll give him one for the torture chamber.

22:07.708 --> 22:09.583
Go, Local 85!

22:09.583 --> 22:10.625
Yeah!

22:10.625 --> 22:13.458
Quasi! Quasi! Quasi!

22:13.458 --> 22:14.750
Knock, knock!

22:20.500 --> 22:24.458
Now you say, "Who's there?", sire.

22:24.458 --> 22:27.000
I have to participate?

22:27.000 --> 22:28.291
Yeah.

22:28.958 --> 22:31.208
Who is there?

22:31.208 --> 22:33.166
King Guy.

22:33.166 --> 22:34.750
- What?
- No.

22:35.250 --> 22:38.250
You say, "King Guy, who?", sire.

22:38.250 --> 22:40.000
Oh, I really don't get it.

22:40.000 --> 22:41.625
Guards, tar him!

22:41.625 --> 22:43.125
- No, no!
All right.

22:43.125 --> 22:44.791
- Wait.
- Okay, fine.

22:44.791 --> 22:46.208
- Feather him.
- What?

22:46.208 --> 22:48.375
- No, no!
- Ooh, I have an idea.

22:48.375 --> 22:50.708
What about a little of both?
Could be a fun new thing.

22:50.708 --> 22:51.791
Please, sire.

22:51.791 --> 22:54.416
It would be wrong
to orphan this man's children.

22:54.416 --> 22:55.541
Fine, then.

22:55.541 --> 22:57.583
- Kill the kids too.
- No!

22:57.583 --> 22:59.166
- No!
- Kidding!

22:59.166 --> 23:01.833
Guards, go easy on the tar.

23:01.833 --> 23:03.083
- No, no, no.
Easy now.

23:03.083 --> 23:05.416
- No!
Come on, Jester.

23:05.416 --> 23:06.750
Happy, my queen?

23:06.750 --> 23:07.875
Do something!

23:07.875 --> 23:09.500
Yes.

23:09.500 --> 23:13.500
Your Majesty,
I present the torturer, Quasi Modo.

23:16.625 --> 23:19.500
Quasi Modo, my little friend.

23:21.125 --> 23:25.041
The queen tells me that as a tormentor,
you're unparalleled.

23:25.041 --> 23:27.000
Sire, are you aware that he is the one

23:27.000 --> 23:29.708
who invented
your most successful torture device?

23:29.708 --> 23:32.000
You mean my mother-in-law?

23:36.333 --> 23:37.708
- I'm joking, of course.

23:37.708 --> 23:39.416
Of course, you are. Very funny, sire.

23:39.416 --> 23:45.500
So, Mr. Modo,
what's it feel like to be a winner?

23:46.625 --> 23:48.458
- Oh.
- Um.

23:48.458 --> 23:51.166
Um, really good... [chuckles] ...Your Majesty.

23:51.166 --> 23:53.250
Really good, indeed.

23:53.250 --> 23:55.958
- Come. Sit. Feast with your king.

23:55.958 --> 23:57.291
Yes. Yes.

23:57.291 --> 23:58.833
Mind your manners, pig.

24:00.541 --> 24:02.000
Please, please. Sit.

24:05.166 --> 24:08.333
Enjoy! Eat! Drink!

24:14.708 --> 24:16.625
Hmm. Quite hungry.

24:16.625 --> 24:18.958
- Mmm.

24:20.541 --> 24:24.583
The queen tells me
that you're very fond of oysters.

24:24.583 --> 24:26.875
Well, I've never actually tried them.

24:26.875 --> 24:29.625
Never actually tried one? Oh.

24:31.958 --> 24:35.375
Then you must try the food of kings.

24:35.375 --> 24:37.875
Fresh Belon oysters.

24:38.541 --> 24:42.708
Oysters. Oysters. Oysters. Oysters.

24:58.333 --> 24:59.708
Sweet baby Jesus.

25:00.916 --> 25:01.916
Have another.

25:02.416 --> 25:04.208
Another oyster, my king?

25:04.208 --> 25:06.166
Please, call me Guy.

25:06.166 --> 25:08.541
- Okay. Thank you, Guy.

25:08.541 --> 25:10.708
How dare you call the king of France
by his name?

25:10.708 --> 25:12.375
- Guards, off with his head!
What?

25:12.375 --> 25:15.375
- You told him to do that.
- Kidding. Kidding.

25:17.250 --> 25:19.458
Did you see the look on his face? Hilar!

25:19.458 --> 25:22.000
Yes. Good one, sire.

25:22.000 --> 25:28.750
Catherine, I wish to speak to Quasi alone
about things you would not understand.

25:28.750 --> 25:29.875
So leave us.

25:29.875 --> 25:30.958
What things?

25:30.958 --> 25:32.333
Male things.

25:32.333 --> 25:35.875
Foreskins, Adam's apples,
hemorrhoids and the like.

25:35.875 --> 25:37.666
Many women suffer from hemorrhoids.

25:37.666 --> 25:39.541
- In fact, last week--
- Leave us!

25:42.041 --> 25:43.041
Hmm.

25:47.250 --> 25:50.333
My new queen likes to speak
of hemorrhoids.

25:50.333 --> 25:52.916
- Sexy.

25:52.916 --> 25:56.541
Quasi, I would like you to kill the pope.

25:59.958 --> 26:01.333
Are you all right?

26:03.166 --> 26:04.208
- Can you--
- Should I do--

26:04.208 --> 26:05.625
- Do something.
- What should I do?

26:05.625 --> 26:07.250
- Should I pound his hump or--

26:07.250 --> 26:08.541
- I don't know.
- Is there--

26:08.541 --> 26:10.666
There may be goblins in there.
I don't know what's in there.

26:10.666 --> 26:12.041
- Get out of the way.

26:14.291 --> 26:16.208
- Good show, sire. Good show.

26:16.791 --> 26:19.958
Um, I'm sorry, Your Majesty.

26:19.958 --> 26:21.416
You want me to do what?

26:21.416 --> 26:23.666
At your private confession,

26:23.666 --> 26:28.458
I want you to assassinate the pope
in the name of France.

26:28.458 --> 26:29.958
But it's the pope.

26:29.958 --> 26:32.791
He's a danger to France
and a total asshole.

26:33.541 --> 26:35.166
- Henri.

26:36.958 --> 26:37.916
Sire.

26:37.916 --> 26:43.041
These are actual depictions
of the pope having sex with Saracen women.

26:43.958 --> 26:45.625
Yes, and these are all very real.

26:45.625 --> 26:47.500
Bestiality!

26:47.500 --> 26:48.791
Oh, <i>mon Dieu</i>!

26:48.791 --> 26:49.875
Butt stuff.

26:49.875 --> 26:51.291
Oh, my gosh.

26:51.291 --> 26:52.375
Is that mud?

26:52.375 --> 26:53.458
It's not mud.

26:54.083 --> 26:55.083
It's not mud.

26:55.083 --> 26:57.583
What's this?
Felching. It's awful.

26:57.583 --> 26:59.208
It looks like she's praying.

26:59.208 --> 27:00.666
God is not in there, my friend.

27:00.666 --> 27:02.000
He must be killed.

27:02.000 --> 27:04.458
Your Majesty, why have you chosen me?

27:04.458 --> 27:07.750
God chose you when you won the lottery.

27:07.750 --> 27:12.500
And God knows
that only you can take him by surprise.

27:12.500 --> 27:16.416
Yes. In the confessional, there will be
a dagger hidden under the bench.

27:16.416 --> 27:19.541
You will drive that dagger
into the pope's heart.

27:20.625 --> 27:23.416
Your Majesty, I cannot do this.

27:23.416 --> 27:27.625
You will,
or you will be executed as a traitor.

27:28.458 --> 27:31.291
And we'll kill
that best friend of yours too.

27:31.291 --> 27:32.458
My best friend?

27:32.458 --> 27:34.916
That jolly fat fellow
with whom you share your hut.

27:35.583 --> 27:38.375
Does the name Duchamp ring a bell?

27:38.875 --> 27:40.291
Pun intended.

27:41.750 --> 27:43.708
I would hardly say we're best friends.

27:43.708 --> 27:45.500
We're more like coworkers or hut mates.

27:45.500 --> 27:47.791
You see,
he needed a place to live closer to town--

27:47.791 --> 27:49.708
Who gives a fuck?

27:49.708 --> 27:51.791
You will assassinate the pope,

27:51.791 --> 27:55.333
or you and your hut mate
will be drawn and quartered,

27:55.333 --> 27:58.416
and your limbs will be taken
to the four corners of France!

27:58.416 --> 28:01.916
Do I make myself clear, Hunchback?

28:10.291 --> 28:12.250
I am so psyched I gave you my ticket.

28:13.541 --> 28:16.083
- Are you gonna kill him?
- He can't do that. It's the pope.

28:16.083 --> 28:18.541
- You could run away.
- No, the king would find me.

28:19.041 --> 28:22.000
And he said
he's gonna draw and quarter Duchamp.

28:22.000 --> 28:24.166
- Why me?
- He thinks we're best friends.

28:24.166 --> 28:26.416
- We're not best friends.
- That's what I said.

28:26.416 --> 28:27.750
I have many best friends.

28:27.750 --> 28:29.166
Oh, is that so?

28:29.166 --> 28:31.041
- Yeah, that is so.
- Okay.

28:31.041 --> 28:33.041
There's Jerome from Champagne.

28:33.041 --> 28:33.958
Oh, wow.

28:33.958 --> 28:36.250
I didn't realize
you'd ever been to Champagne. Hmm.

28:36.250 --> 28:37.250
Jerome's cool!

28:37.250 --> 28:38.333
No, he sounds cool.

28:38.333 --> 28:40.000
- He's a butcher.
- Oh, wow.

28:40.000 --> 28:41.416
He also trades silks.

28:41.416 --> 28:42.541
He's been to the Orient?

28:42.541 --> 28:43.625
Several times.

28:43.625 --> 28:45.416
Oh, wow. He's so well-traveled.

28:45.416 --> 28:47.166
And next time, he's bringing me with him.

28:47.166 --> 28:49.833
Sounds like this Jerome from Champagne
is your best friend.

28:49.833 --> 28:51.083
I didn't say that.

28:51.083 --> 28:52.750
I don't believe in labels. Same as you.

28:52.750 --> 28:55.166
Are you Quasi Modo?

28:55.166 --> 28:56.458
Yeah, I guess so.

28:56.458 --> 28:59.958
Well, Mr. Celebrity,
do you want a Black Death shot?

29:00.791 --> 29:02.625
- Yeah, sure.
Mm-hmm.

29:02.625 --> 29:05.041
Um. Uh, cheers, ladies.

29:05.041 --> 29:06.458
Thanks.

29:06.458 --> 29:08.791
Oh, that's tasty.

29:08.791 --> 29:10.416
Will you sign my bosom?

29:10.416 --> 29:12.041
- What?
- Are you for real?

29:12.041 --> 29:13.625
What is going on here?

29:16.166 --> 29:18.666
- How'd you get so clean, by the way?

29:18.666 --> 29:19.916
- The river.

29:19.916 --> 29:21.625
Excuse me, ladies.

29:21.625 --> 29:24.875
My name is Duchamp,
and I am Quasi's hut mate.

29:25.458 --> 29:27.041
- Uh-uh.

29:27.041 --> 29:28.916
- No. Bye.
Oh.

29:31.208 --> 29:33.250
That'll be three francs
for the Black Death shots.

29:33.250 --> 29:35.333
- I didn't even drink 'em.
- Three francs!

29:36.500 --> 29:37.583
Fine.

29:38.208 --> 29:40.416
Why don't you send the bill
to Jerome from Champagne?

29:40.416 --> 29:42.041
- Maybe I will.
- Okay.

29:42.041 --> 29:43.125
Asshole.

29:46.291 --> 29:48.750
All right,
I think that's probably pretty hot.

29:48.750 --> 29:51.083
Yeah, that looks pretty good to me.
I think you can stop now.

29:51.083 --> 29:54.458
You and your main mother-plucker
over here.

29:54.458 --> 29:56.166
- What?

30:11.416 --> 30:12.541
What is this?

30:12.541 --> 30:14.791
Where are the cheering throngs?

30:15.291 --> 30:17.083
Who is in charge of marketing?

30:17.083 --> 30:19.416
But what about that though? Nice, right?

30:24.500 --> 30:26.458
- Makes me look fat.

30:26.458 --> 30:27.666
And look at that fop.

30:28.708 --> 30:30.500
Does he expect us to stay at the castle?

30:30.500 --> 30:32.625
Either that or the local monastery.

30:32.625 --> 30:33.708
Benedictines?

30:33.708 --> 30:35.208
Cistercians.

30:35.208 --> 30:36.541
Vow of poverty.

30:36.541 --> 30:37.958
Hard pass.

30:38.875 --> 30:41.125
Tell me there's at least
a welcome committee of whores.

30:42.166 --> 30:43.750
'Twas a joke, Claude.

30:45.291 --> 30:46.500
By the way, Your Grace,

30:46.500 --> 30:49.958
you should know that the winner
of the papal lottery is a hunchback.

30:49.958 --> 30:51.833
A hunchback? No! Change it.

30:51.833 --> 30:53.041
It's all planned out--

30:53.041 --> 30:55.458
Do you have any idea
the questions he'll have for me?

30:55.458 --> 30:57.458
"Holy Father, can you fix my hump?"

30:57.458 --> 30:59.875
"Is not my very existence proof
there is no God?"

30:59.875 --> 31:02.166
I don't want to get into
that whole hornet's nest.

31:02.166 --> 31:03.916
We should proceed, Holiness.

31:03.916 --> 31:06.833
We must prepare for
your banquet with the king.

31:06.833 --> 31:08.375
Do you think he'll try to poison me?

31:08.375 --> 31:09.625
I don't know.

31:09.625 --> 31:11.541
I'll tell you what I do know.

31:11.541 --> 31:13.250
You're eating for two tonight.

31:13.250 --> 31:15.750
So no filling up on stuffed olives
and the like.

31:15.750 --> 31:16.875
Oh, don't mind me.

31:16.875 --> 31:18.875
- I'll just walk the last bit.

31:34.458 --> 31:37.000
- I feel sorry for the chicken.

31:37.000 --> 31:39.500
Your Royal Highness,
may I present to you--

31:39.500 --> 31:41.333
He knows who I am.

31:43.750 --> 31:44.750
Guy.

31:44.750 --> 31:46.958
Cornelius.

31:46.958 --> 31:48.708
Guillotine.

31:48.708 --> 31:50.833
- Cornholio.
Yes.

31:53.166 --> 31:54.166
Oh.

31:54.166 --> 31:56.833
Still overdoing it with that same <i>parfum</i>?

31:56.833 --> 31:58.166
What do you call it? Wet sheep?

31:58.166 --> 32:00.333
And I see you're still wearing none.

32:01.333 --> 32:05.083
Please, meet my new bride,
Queen Catherine.

32:05.083 --> 32:06.208
Your Holiness.

32:06.208 --> 32:07.916
Ooh. Hotchy motchy.

32:08.916 --> 32:10.958
- How long have you two been married?
- Two weeks.

32:10.958 --> 32:12.833
Has he shown you his third nipple?

32:12.833 --> 32:14.666
It seems you know each other well.

32:14.666 --> 32:17.125
We were classmates together at <i>université</i>.

32:17.125 --> 32:18.166
I didn't know that.

32:18.166 --> 32:20.708
And therein lies
the problem with arranged marriage.

32:21.791 --> 32:23.708
Dinner is served.

32:23.708 --> 32:25.916
- I hope you like everything.

32:25.916 --> 32:27.166
Ooh!

32:32.500 --> 32:33.958
Sire.

32:36.250 --> 32:40.500
So, Catherine, congratulations
on your coronation ceremony.

32:40.500 --> 32:42.458
You'll be wearing something daring,
I hope.

32:42.458 --> 32:46.541
I don't know that it will be daring,
but thank you, Holy Father.

32:46.541 --> 32:48.291
I'm honored that you will be attending.

32:48.291 --> 32:53.166
Oh, he's never one to pass up a crowd
or to soak said crowd for donations.

32:53.166 --> 32:54.208
Guilty.

32:54.208 --> 32:57.041
Uh, I'm sorry.
I only drink wine from a goblet.

32:57.041 --> 32:58.583
Oh, we don't have goblets.

32:58.583 --> 33:00.583
Oh, not a problem.
I'll just take a chalice.

33:00.583 --> 33:02.750
We don't have "chali" either.

33:02.750 --> 33:04.375
Well, what do you have then?

33:04.375 --> 33:08.208
That crystal fucking wine glass
that's right there on the table.

33:08.208 --> 33:09.375
Fine. I won't have wine.

33:09.375 --> 33:10.541
Fine. Don't.

33:10.541 --> 33:11.958
I shan't.

33:12.750 --> 33:13.750
Mmm.

33:15.500 --> 33:20.000
Cardinal Claude,
I think I prefer you in that seat.

33:20.000 --> 33:21.875
You, man. Stand up.

33:21.875 --> 33:23.500
- Claude, sit in that seat.
- Huh?

33:24.500 --> 33:25.875
Pause.

33:26.500 --> 33:27.958
That is where my man sits.

33:27.958 --> 33:30.000
- Henri-Francoise, sit down.
- Very good, sire.

33:30.000 --> 33:32.791
That is where the pope wishes
his man to sit.

33:32.791 --> 33:34.625
You, up. Claude, sit.

33:36.208 --> 33:38.958
Stand now, or I shall lop your head off.

33:38.958 --> 33:39.875
Oh.

33:39.875 --> 33:41.708
Henri-Francoise, sit!

33:41.708 --> 33:44.208
I am the pope. Sit.

33:44.208 --> 33:46.166
Okay.

33:46.166 --> 33:50.416
Are we really doing this again
in my country?

33:50.416 --> 33:51.833
They're all my countries.

33:51.833 --> 33:55.083
The only reason you're here is
so you can horn in on her coronation.

33:55.083 --> 33:58.166
And you're only coronating because you
don't have the sack to rule this country

33:58.166 --> 33:59.916
without your new wife's big army.

33:59.916 --> 34:02.333
Please, gentlemen. Let's enjoy the feast.

34:02.333 --> 34:06.875
Why don't you take your papal supremacy
and shove it up your funny fucking hat?

34:06.875 --> 34:09.541
I will not sit here
and let you take potshots at my hat!

34:10.125 --> 34:11.125
Bring it on, bitch!

34:12.333 --> 34:16.000
Uh, did you hear the one about the peanuts
that were walking down the street?

34:16.000 --> 34:18.375
- Stand aside, goose man.
They got assaulted!

34:24.458 --> 34:25.791
Do not break this up!

34:27.416 --> 34:28.416
Yes, sire. Oh!

34:32.458 --> 34:34.166
Break this up right now!

34:35.416 --> 34:36.750
- Okay, go, go!
Yes, my Lord.

34:39.916 --> 34:41.708
Oh! No, stop.

34:41.708 --> 34:44.041
No, no, no, no.

34:44.958 --> 34:46.250
I totally kicked your ass.

34:46.250 --> 34:48.750
After all these years,
you're still a dick!

34:48.750 --> 34:50.500
Claude, we're leaving now!

34:51.666 --> 34:53.625
Guard! Open that door.

34:54.583 --> 34:56.750
Guard, do not open that door.

34:57.625 --> 34:59.916
Open that door,
or I will send you to hell.

35:00.666 --> 35:03.125
Open that door,
and I'll make you a eunuch.

35:08.666 --> 35:09.666
Enjoy hell.

35:11.916 --> 35:14.791
You ready for Confession Day?
I don't know.

35:14.791 --> 35:17.541
Just relax.
This is a day like any other day.

35:18.166 --> 35:19.541
- Okay.
- Let's do this.

35:23.500 --> 35:25.000
Quasi! Quasi.

35:25.833 --> 35:27.416
What will you confess to the pope today?

35:27.416 --> 35:29.333
Are you gonna ask for a new back?

35:29.333 --> 35:32.166
Oh, yeah, like a thick back or a wide back
or a skinny back or a tall back, maybe?

35:32.166 --> 35:34.000
Or perhaps a new face.

35:34.000 --> 35:36.041
Because your face
is not the face that people want.

35:36.041 --> 35:37.500
No mom would like that face.

35:37.500 --> 35:39.041
They'd be like,
"Put it back in my vagina."

35:39.041 --> 35:41.500
Okay. Settle down.
Move away. Let him through.

35:41.500 --> 35:43.958
Move back. Go to work.
Give him some space.

35:43.958 --> 35:47.625
Hey! I made my very special
Confession Day fondue.

35:47.625 --> 35:48.750
Have a taste.

35:48.750 --> 35:50.000
Oh! Mm-hmm.

35:51.500 --> 35:54.875
Mmm. <i>Mon Dieu</i>, that's good fondue.

35:54.875 --> 35:57.750
<i>Sacrebleu.</i> That's great fondue!

35:57.750 --> 35:59.000
All right, all right.

35:59.000 --> 36:01.250
The pope is gonna be here any minute,
so look alive.

36:01.250 --> 36:03.208
Torturers, I want heads-up torturing.

36:03.208 --> 36:05.666
Hey, shitbrain! Make that infidel bleed.

36:05.666 --> 36:08.583
Uh, this is more of
a psychological torture station.

36:08.583 --> 36:09.833
Then make him cry!

36:09.833 --> 36:11.166
Okay.

36:11.166 --> 36:13.125
Michel, the pope's gonna crank the rack.

36:13.125 --> 36:16.291
Uh, if it doesn't hurt, then you gotta
zhuzh it up a little bit.

36:16.291 --> 36:18.125
You know? Play it up.
Okay?

36:18.125 --> 36:20.541
- Yeah! I can do that.
He's coming!

36:20.541 --> 36:22.958
- Oh! Okay, this is it. This is it.
- Oh, oh.

36:22.958 --> 36:24.500
- Okay. Okay.
Okay, places!

36:24.500 --> 36:25.583
Okay, go.

36:36.166 --> 36:37.541
- Oh, my.

36:41.000 --> 36:43.208
Jesus H. Christ.

36:45.375 --> 36:46.791
God.

36:46.791 --> 36:49.291
Good God, it stinks in here.

36:49.291 --> 36:50.416
Can we speed this up?

36:50.416 --> 36:51.666
- Of course, Your Grace.
- Yes.

36:58.833 --> 37:00.333
Very painful, yes.

37:00.916 --> 37:02.791
Oh, that-- Thus, the stink, yes.

37:02.791 --> 37:04.208
Stinky eggs.

37:04.208 --> 37:07.000
Pontiff,
may I introduce my finest employee

37:07.000 --> 37:09.958
and your confessee, Quasi Modo?

37:12.958 --> 37:14.125
Your Holiness.

37:14.125 --> 37:17.083
Quasi, my faithful lamb.

37:17.583 --> 37:19.416
God has told me so much about you.

37:19.416 --> 37:21.583
- He has?
- He's told me everything.

37:21.583 --> 37:24.166
- Your Holiness, I would never ever--
- Now, listen to me.

37:24.166 --> 37:26.208
We're going to do
this confession quick and dirty.

37:26.208 --> 37:28.083
No requests to deflate that hump

37:28.083 --> 37:30.208
or blessings for your uncle's cat
or what have you.

37:30.208 --> 37:33.000
- Okay.
- Hmm, get a load of stretch over here.

37:33.500 --> 37:34.875
Are you an infidel as well?

37:34.875 --> 37:37.083
No, uh, just a culinary student.

37:37.083 --> 37:39.583
In fact, I made these in your honor.

37:39.583 --> 37:41.250
<i>Éclairs au chocolat.</i>

37:41.250 --> 37:43.250
My favorite!

37:43.250 --> 37:44.666
Claude, Claude, come quickly.

37:53.708 --> 37:54.791
Still here.

37:54.791 --> 37:55.875
Good enough for me.

38:03.166 --> 38:04.708
Fuck me.

38:04.708 --> 38:06.583
That is divine!

38:06.583 --> 38:08.833
Oh! Mmm. [smacks lips] Mmm.

38:08.833 --> 38:10.625
One thousand blessings upon you.

38:10.625 --> 38:12.000
Thank you, Your Grace.

38:12.000 --> 38:13.416
Thank you.

38:13.416 --> 38:15.625
This must be that rack
I've heard so much about.

38:15.625 --> 38:16.541
'Tis.

38:16.541 --> 38:18.458
Mind if I give it a crank?

38:18.458 --> 38:20.875
'Twould be an honor, Your Grace.

38:20.875 --> 38:22.250
Look at me. I'm a torturer.

38:23.791 --> 38:25.375
Get him clamped in here.

38:25.375 --> 38:26.750
Ooh. Ah.

38:26.750 --> 38:27.833
- Yes, yes, yes.
- Yeah.

38:27.833 --> 38:31.375
Okay, so,
pull it thusly and push like this?

38:31.375 --> 38:33.166
- Not yet, not yet.

38:33.166 --> 38:34.375
- The other way.
- Yes.

38:34.375 --> 38:35.833
- Yeah.
- Very, very good. Oh!

38:35.833 --> 38:37.083
Oh.

38:40.166 --> 38:41.916
Ah!

38:41.916 --> 38:44.791
Yeah, tortured! Well done.
Mmm, mmm.

38:44.791 --> 38:46.250
Time for the confession!

38:47.000 --> 38:49.791
Oh, so sorry.
I would've loved to have stayed longer.

38:54.750 --> 38:55.583
- Hey! What--
- Yeah?

38:55.583 --> 38:56.583
You couldn't introduce me?

38:56.583 --> 38:58.875
Du, I'm in the middle of a situation here.
What are you talking about?

38:58.875 --> 39:00.083
You introduced Michel!

39:00.083 --> 39:01.375
Well, I actually introduced myself.

39:01.375 --> 39:04.000
Okay, I've had enough of you,
Mr. <i>Éclairs au chocolat</i>.

39:04.000 --> 39:05.375
Come along, Hunchback!

39:06.250 --> 39:07.791
Duchamp Rousseau, what is your problem?

39:07.791 --> 39:09.708
Don't you have to kill somebody?

39:10.500 --> 39:12.083
You're a real asshole, Duchamp.

39:35.583 --> 39:37.500
Enough monk-y business.

39:38.833 --> 39:40.083
Leave us!

39:55.958 --> 39:58.500
You know that feeling
when your father's on his deathbed,

39:58.500 --> 40:00.416
and you're about to be crowned king?

40:00.416 --> 40:01.750
No, I don't, sire.

40:01.750 --> 40:04.416
It's a tingling feeling.
I'm feeling it right now.

40:04.416 --> 40:07.500
Oh, yes. I can only imagine.

40:20.708 --> 40:22.500
- Are you going to start?

40:22.500 --> 40:24.875
Or am I just going to sit here
diddling my crosier?

40:24.875 --> 40:27.125
Oh, I-- Uh, yeah, I'm sorry. Sorry.

40:27.708 --> 40:29.750
Your Grace, is God all-knowing?

40:29.750 --> 40:31.125
Do I shit in the woods?

40:31.125 --> 40:32.750
I don't know. You tell me.

40:32.750 --> 40:34.958
- I do. It's divine.
- Oh.

40:34.958 --> 40:38.083
Though, I cannot say how pleasant
for the poor chap who has to wipe my ass.

40:38.083 --> 40:42.916
Um, Your Holiness, I have been tasked
with something <i>horrible</i>,

40:42.916 --> 40:45.208
and you're the only person
who can help me.

40:45.833 --> 40:48.583
Hunchback, I want you
to assassinate the king.

40:50.791 --> 40:53.291
God made a mistake
giving you a hunched back.

40:53.916 --> 40:57.791
He will straighten out your back
in exchange for this one very small task.

40:57.791 --> 41:00.958
He wants you to kill the king tomorrow at
the public square in front of his people.

41:00.958 --> 41:02.666
Uh, Your Holiness, I-I--

41:02.666 --> 41:05.708
Listen to me, Hunchman, and hear me well.

41:05.708 --> 41:09.083
Disobey me, and God will send you
directly to Hunchback Hell

41:09.083 --> 41:11.583
alongside that oafish
best friend of yours!

41:11.583 --> 41:14.000
Duchamp? No, we're just hut mates.

41:14.000 --> 41:17.791
Uh, he needed a place to live
closer to town. I was short on rent.

41:17.791 --> 41:21.125
I don't give a resounding fuck
about your housing arrangements!

41:22.375 --> 41:25.708
Ah, I see you found the jewel-encrusted
dagger I had placed in your booth. Good.

41:25.708 --> 41:28.833
Now, don't let the door hit you
on the hump on the way out.

41:43.791 --> 41:45.333
Merde.

41:48.666 --> 41:50.541
You bastard <i>magnifique</i>.

41:50.541 --> 41:53.125
Someone's getting a lot more vassals
to rule over.

41:53.125 --> 41:55.625
Thank you, sire. I hope they're English.

42:02.416 --> 42:06.541
Oh, do you think he'll wail like a maiden
when he finds him dead?

42:06.541 --> 42:08.041
God, I hope so.

42:11.416 --> 42:15.166
Holy shit,
I have to take a holy shit.

42:16.458 --> 42:18.166
Quickly.

42:20.208 --> 42:21.750
Bring me the hunchback.

42:21.750 --> 42:22.833
Yes, sire.

42:33.333 --> 42:38.458
You have exactly five seconds
to explain why the pope is still alive.

42:38.458 --> 42:39.625
-<i>Un</i>.
- Well--

42:39.625 --> 42:40.875
-<i>Deux</i>.
- But--

42:40.875 --> 42:42.708
-<i>Quatre!</i>
- What about <i>trois</i>?

42:42.708 --> 42:45.083
-<i>Cinq!</i>
There was no weapon!

42:45.083 --> 42:46.625
- No dagger.
- What?

42:46.625 --> 42:50.166
There was no dagger in the confessional.
I didn't have anything to kill him with.

42:51.500 --> 42:53.958
I placed it there myself,
my liege.

42:53.958 --> 42:56.541
There was nothing there. You can check.

42:56.541 --> 43:00.083
Probably thieves.
You know France and its thieves.

43:01.625 --> 43:04.625
Yes, well, France certainly has thieves,
doesn't it? Especially in confessionals.

43:04.625 --> 43:06.166
Enough!

43:06.875 --> 43:10.750
You have left me
with unfinished business, Hunchback.

43:10.750 --> 43:12.625
I can make it up to you.

43:13.125 --> 43:16.125
I'm just spitballing here.
I mean, this is probably the bad version.

43:16.125 --> 43:20.083
But perhaps we could wait
and try again later.

43:20.083 --> 43:23.500
Say, oh, next Christmas.

43:23.500 --> 43:28.291
Can-- He would never see that coming.
Can you imagine how surprised he'd--

43:28.291 --> 43:30.541
- Excellent idea.
- 'Tis?

43:30.541 --> 43:33.833
Excellent idea, indeed.

43:34.541 --> 43:40.208
Tomorrow at our public appearance
in the square, you will kill the pope.

43:40.208 --> 43:45.333
Then my guards will subdue you, proving
the power of the throne over the church.

43:45.833 --> 43:48.666
And then we'll reward you with wives
and money and land

43:48.666 --> 43:50.291
and just send you on your way.

43:50.916 --> 43:56.125
Yeah. No. I feel like
there's some holes in that plan.

43:56.125 --> 43:59.625
You will kill the pope tomorrow,
or I will slit your throat myself!

44:00.708 --> 44:01.833
Leave us.

44:03.458 --> 44:06.916
I'm assuming you'll have him
publicly executed thereafter, sire?

44:06.916 --> 44:08.625
Oh, yes.

44:08.625 --> 44:11.666
If I can kill my former wife
for flapping her gums,

44:11.666 --> 44:14.166
I can certainly kill one little hunchback.

44:14.166 --> 44:17.166
Yes! Yes!

44:21.166 --> 44:22.166
Good show, sire.

44:22.166 --> 44:25.125
After the coronation,
and with the pope out of the way,

44:25.125 --> 44:27.125
my power will be unchecked!

44:27.125 --> 44:32.375
And then my new wife
will find herself quite expendable.

44:32.375 --> 44:35.208
She's done for!

44:35.208 --> 44:37.375
I thought so. I think so.

44:37.375 --> 44:39.541
I love it. I love it. Top shot.

44:39.541 --> 44:41.750
But let's keep that between ourselves.

44:41.750 --> 44:44.708
Yes. Of course, of course.
Of course, we will.

44:45.666 --> 44:47.916
Yes. Yeah.

44:51.625 --> 44:54.125
Let's have another guard kill this guard.

44:54.125 --> 44:55.583
Yes, sire. Guard!

44:56.916 --> 44:57.916
Yes, my lord.

44:57.916 --> 44:59.416
Kill him.

45:02.875 --> 45:03.875
I'm sorry, who?

45:03.875 --> 45:05.791
- Him.
- Arnaud?

45:05.791 --> 45:06.958
I don't know his name.

45:06.958 --> 45:09.291
No, I couldn't, my lord.
I have known Arnaud my entire life.

45:09.291 --> 45:10.666
We came up together as squires.

45:10.666 --> 45:12.625
I don't care if he's your brother.
Kill him.

45:12.625 --> 45:14.458
Well, he's not my brother.
He is my brother-in-law.

45:14.458 --> 45:16.083
He's married to my youngest sister,
you see.

45:16.083 --> 45:17.583
- I have an idea.
- Hmm.

45:17.583 --> 45:21.791
Would it be easier if we got a third guard
to come in and kill both of these guys?

45:21.791 --> 45:23.083
Oh, whoops! Here we go.

45:27.916 --> 45:29.458
Well.

45:29.458 --> 45:30.791
That was easy.

45:30.791 --> 45:31.916
That'll be all.

45:31.916 --> 45:33.250
Long live the king.

45:33.250 --> 45:35.125
You may go.
- Thank you.

45:40.583 --> 45:43.166
When a job is once begun,
do not stop until it's done.

45:43.666 --> 45:46.000
- Mother used to say that.

45:57.166 --> 45:59.083
- Good work.
- Okay.

46:00.541 --> 46:01.416
Best to your sister.

46:01.416 --> 46:04.333
Huh, seems like a nice fellow.

46:04.333 --> 46:06.083
Yeah, huh. Quite nice.

46:09.833 --> 46:12.333
Did I mention I'm incredibly psyched
I gave you that ticket?

46:12.333 --> 46:14.916
Yeah, you know the pope plans
on damning you to hell too.

46:14.916 --> 46:16.041
We're not best friends!

46:16.041 --> 46:18.958
Yeah, yeah, I know.
Jerome from Champagne, I get it.

46:18.958 --> 46:22.708
Quasi! I'm not usually this guy,
but I gotta know.

46:22.708 --> 46:24.500
What'd you confess to the pope?

46:27.500 --> 46:28.750
Um...

46:30.666 --> 46:37.125
Uh, well, I told him, "Pope,
my biggest sin is that I party too much."

46:41.708 --> 46:43.708
You party too much. I love it.

46:43.708 --> 46:46.208
Hey, how about a song for Quasi?

46:49.833 --> 46:52.958

48:21.166 --> 48:23.875
I'm not afraid to fight. I have a flute.
I will shove it up your ass.

48:25.583 --> 48:27.041
Milady.

48:29.791 --> 48:32.833
Never such a sad song have heard I.

48:33.500 --> 48:37.583
What stank-laden cloud
engulfs your gamy heart?

48:37.583 --> 48:41.250
I cannot say. I've been forbidden.

48:41.250 --> 48:42.708
Who forbade you?

48:42.708 --> 48:45.000
I cannot tell you. I am forbidden.

48:45.000 --> 48:46.625
Who forbade you to do that?

48:46.625 --> 48:49.291
I cannot discuss it. I was forbode.

48:49.291 --> 48:52.166
I hear you, but who did the forbaying?

48:52.166 --> 48:54.875
I'm-- I can't talk about it.

48:54.875 --> 48:57.958
- Please, let's have a sit.
- Oh.

49:02.750 --> 49:04.541
I know your predicament.

49:04.541 --> 49:06.500
- You do?
- Yes.

49:06.500 --> 49:09.250
The king has commanded you
to commit papacide.

49:09.250 --> 49:12.041
Your Majesty,
that's just half of it.

49:12.041 --> 49:14.500
And after you carry out that task,
he's going to kill you.

49:14.500 --> 49:16.791
Oh, fuck!

49:16.791 --> 49:20.166
Okay, he didn't tell me that part.
Well, that's bad news.

49:20.166 --> 49:23.791
No, I was talking about how the pope
also ordered me to kill the king.

49:23.791 --> 49:25.666
- Say what?
- Yeah.

49:25.666 --> 49:26.875
Oh, my.

49:47.250 --> 49:48.541
But why are we laughing?

49:48.541 --> 49:50.666
Things have gotten dark.

49:52.208 --> 49:56.208
I've learned the king's previous wife was
killed when she overstepped her position.

49:57.416 --> 50:00.000
I fear I am bound for the same fate.

50:00.000 --> 50:02.458
-<i>Non</i>.
-<i>Oui</i>.

50:02.458 --> 50:04.958
Sounds like we're both royally screwed.

50:04.958 --> 50:06.041
Well...

50:07.250 --> 50:09.500
maybe we can solve
your immediate problem first.

50:09.500 --> 50:13.625
Why bother? I don't matter.
I'm a nobody.

50:13.625 --> 50:19.750
You are not a nobody.
You are Quasi: inventor, problem solver.

50:19.750 --> 50:23.791
Someone as resourceful as you can
certainly come up with a solution to this.

50:23.791 --> 50:24.875
Come.

50:25.625 --> 50:26.625
Walk with me.

50:27.333 --> 50:28.541
Let us conspire.

50:56.958 --> 50:59.416
I was outside walking and thinking.

50:59.416 --> 51:01.083
Let's drink and forget your troubles.

51:01.083 --> 51:04.250
No, I have a plan.

51:05.000 --> 51:06.750
You came up with this plan
all by yourself?

51:06.750 --> 51:08.166
Yeah, why wouldn't I have?

51:08.166 --> 51:10.375
- Seems to work for everyone.
- Yes, it does.

51:10.375 --> 51:13.000
Gets me off the hook
from killing the king and the pope

51:13.000 --> 51:16.333
and, in the end,
Duchamp looks like a hero.

51:16.333 --> 51:20.000
- I really like that part, a lot!
- Yeah.

51:20.000 --> 51:22.458
- Thanks for thinking of me, Quasi.
- Of course.

51:22.458 --> 51:23.750
After all, you are my...

51:24.750 --> 51:25.750
hut mate.

51:25.750 --> 51:27.875
Yeah. Of course. Hut mate. Right.
Yeah.

51:27.875 --> 51:31.625
Yeah. Yeah. Big day tomorrow.
Let's do this.

51:31.625 --> 51:33.291
Yeah.

51:40.000 --> 51:43.333
And in closing, God smiles upon France,

51:44.083 --> 51:48.416
in spite of the sins of its people,
its endlessly heavy sauces,

51:48.416 --> 51:50.875
and the incompetence of its king.

51:50.875 --> 51:53.416
Oops, I said the quiet part out loud.

51:53.416 --> 51:56.875
Eh, glory be to God and bless you.

52:00.750 --> 52:01.958
Subjects.

52:01.958 --> 52:06.000
By the divine right of kings,
I am the hand of God.

52:06.000 --> 52:08.625
And after this week's coronation,

52:08.625 --> 52:12.958
God will make France
the most powerful kingdom in the world.

52:14.541 --> 52:16.583
Top shot, sire. Top shot.

52:16.583 --> 52:19.000
That all sounds lovely. Yes, yes, yes.

52:19.000 --> 52:20.083
But, remember,

52:20.083 --> 52:24.666
God allows the king to serve,
but he uses my mouth to convey the law.

52:24.666 --> 52:25.958
Very important distinction.

52:25.958 --> 52:28.750
I bet he uses your mouth
for more than that.

52:29.708 --> 52:32.750
How about I put the foot of God
up your royal ass?

52:32.750 --> 52:36.041
How about you try
in that dress of yours?

52:36.041 --> 52:38.541
I couldn't miss your whole ass.

52:38.541 --> 52:39.791
Am I right, people?

52:39.791 --> 52:41.833
- You have syphilis.

52:42.666 --> 52:44.750
- Oh, it's the hunchback.
- Ah.

52:44.750 --> 52:47.125
Let's bring up the papal lottery winner.

52:47.125 --> 52:49.416
Indeed, indeed.
Bring up the lottery winner.

52:51.708 --> 52:53.875
Oh.

52:54.583 --> 52:56.708
Oh, no. He's a madman.

52:56.708 --> 53:01.125
Oh. Lord help us.
He seems quite insane and dangerous.

53:01.708 --> 53:05.625
Ah, somebody better stop me
before I kill someone.

53:05.625 --> 53:07.416
- Hold on.

53:09.333 --> 53:11.708
Not so fast, hunchbacked infidel.

53:11.708 --> 53:13.458
- What's this?

53:20.208 --> 53:23.416
Oh, God. There's no coming back from this.

53:23.416 --> 53:25.416
What the fuck?

53:25.416 --> 53:26.833
I've subdued him.

53:26.833 --> 53:32.958
I think you did more than that.
I think you killed me.

53:35.333 --> 53:38.666
Long live Pope Cornelius and King Guy!

53:38.666 --> 53:43.916
Four more years. Four more years.
Four more years.

53:43.916 --> 53:45.541
Four more years.

53:45.541 --> 53:49.458
Uh, this corpse is an affront
to your combined excellencies.

53:50.166 --> 53:54.458
I will take it back to my place
and pound it to a pulp with a rock.

53:54.458 --> 53:56.166
With a rock!

53:56.166 --> 54:00.375
So be it.
Let the hero dispose of the body.

54:01.958 --> 54:03.416
You must have been scared.

54:03.416 --> 54:05.250
No. You must have been scared.

54:05.250 --> 54:07.416
No, I believe it is you who was scared.

54:07.416 --> 54:09.583
Ow.

54:11.333 --> 54:13.083
Come on. Hurry. Hurry.

54:26.791 --> 54:29.375
Did you hear those people cheering for me?
That was amazing!

54:29.375 --> 54:32.083
Okay, listen, we need to dispose
of these clothes

54:32.083 --> 54:33.791
and make sure we weren't followed.

54:33.791 --> 54:34.958
Buddy, it worked.

54:34.958 --> 54:37.458
The cow guts, the fake knife,
it all worked!

54:37.458 --> 54:39.041
It was a great plan. You should be happy.

54:39.041 --> 54:41.750
Oh, I'm not really looking forward
to the next part of the plan.

54:41.750 --> 54:43.666
You only have to stay here
for, like, a year.

54:43.666 --> 54:45.875
You promise you'll come by regularly
with supplies

54:45.875 --> 54:47.500
and news of the outside world?

54:47.500 --> 54:48.583
<i>Absolument.</i>

54:48.583 --> 54:52.125
How about I bring back
a giant sack of Belon oysters?

54:52.125 --> 54:54.000
Oh, come on. Where are you gonna get that?

54:54.000 --> 54:55.500
That's a good point.

54:56.625 --> 54:57.916
You know what? At the very least,

54:57.916 --> 55:00.916
tonight, I'll come back
with some hog anus and trough water!

55:00.916 --> 55:03.375
Really? [laughs] That's my favorite.

55:03.375 --> 55:05.708
- Oh, and how about a bell? Want a bell?
- No.

55:05.708 --> 55:07.333
I'll bring you a bell. Come on.

55:07.333 --> 55:09.875
- Okay. Okay.
- All right.

55:09.875 --> 55:11.958
- You can't ring it, though.
- Oh, yeah, I know.

55:11.958 --> 55:14.916
Hey, it's gonna be okay. Hang in there.

55:16.333 --> 55:17.333
Okay.

55:18.541 --> 55:22.208
Hey, extra rare on the hog anus, please.
Just show it to the flame.

55:33.041 --> 55:34.875
- Hey, what's up?
- Hey. Hey.

55:35.500 --> 55:37.041
- How's he doing?
- He's doing great.

55:37.041 --> 55:38.458
I stashed him in the cave.

55:38.458 --> 55:40.041
- He's moody. The yoozh.
- Uh-huh.

55:40.041 --> 55:41.375
How's the action around here?

55:41.375 --> 55:43.208
Pretty good. Lots of talk about today.

55:43.208 --> 55:44.291
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

55:44.291 --> 55:45.333
Anyone talking about me?

55:45.333 --> 55:49.625
- Oh, hey. Terrible about Quasi. So sad.
- Very sad.

55:49.625 --> 55:51.875
Oh, yeah. Super sad. Super sad. Super sad.

55:51.875 --> 55:55.416
Um, by chance, has anyone offered
to buy me a drink tonight?

55:55.916 --> 55:57.250
For what?

55:57.250 --> 55:59.125
My role in today's events?

55:59.125 --> 56:01.291
Oh, yeah. You were on stage, weren't you?

56:01.291 --> 56:03.375
Yeah, yeah. I subdued Quasi.

56:03.375 --> 56:05.958
Mmm, I remember him stabbing himself.

56:05.958 --> 56:07.125
No, I subdued him.

56:07.125 --> 56:09.416
- Are we talking about the same event?
- Yes!

56:09.416 --> 56:12.416
Laurent,
do you remember Duchamp subduing Quasi?

56:12.958 --> 56:14.375
-<i>Non.</i>
- Okay.

56:14.375 --> 56:15.833
Shots, please.

56:15.833 --> 56:16.916
Hey, there.

56:16.916 --> 56:19.500
Did you see what happened to your friend,
the hunchback, today?

56:19.500 --> 56:21.833
Did you see
who saved the pope and the king today?

56:21.833 --> 56:24.625
Yeah, some guy.
Seemed pretty unremarkable.

56:24.625 --> 56:27.250
Like, one of those faces
you forget about immediately.

56:27.250 --> 56:30.541
Screw that guy. I wish the hunchback
stabbed those bastards.

56:30.541 --> 56:31.625
Right?

56:31.625 --> 56:33.791
- To the hunchback.
- To the hunchback.

56:33.791 --> 56:35.250
Yeah.

56:35.833 --> 56:38.000
- To the hunchback. Right.
How about another?

56:42.375 --> 56:44.500
Yeah, that's pretty good.
Who's that cool guy?

56:44.500 --> 56:49.833
Yeah, it looks like a young Marco Polo
if his face got slammed with a hammer.

56:49.833 --> 56:52.125
What's it feel like
to stand straight up and down?

56:54.708 --> 56:57.750
Who is that? Who goes there?
Who is that? I have a stick.

56:57.750 --> 56:58.958
Gotcha.

56:58.958 --> 57:01.750
Oh, God. For crying out Pete.

57:01.750 --> 57:02.833
Oh, no.

57:03.333 --> 57:06.791
Ugh. I fear I've been reading far too much
<i>Beowulf</i> lately. I am so sorry.

57:06.791 --> 57:08.916
My Queen.
- Please, stand.

57:08.916 --> 57:11.958
Any man who has your courage
need not kneel to me.

57:16.041 --> 57:20.375
Ah. You smell
of refreshingly aromatic fragrances.

57:20.375 --> 57:22.708
And you of stinky ones.

57:28.041 --> 57:29.791
- What are you painting?
- Mmm?

57:30.625 --> 57:33.750
Oh. I call that a selfie.

57:33.750 --> 57:35.708
Why would anyone make a picture
of themselves?

57:35.708 --> 57:38.916
I don't know,
but it is strangely satisfying.

57:38.916 --> 57:41.666
Sometimes you have to do it, like,
five times before you get it right.

57:41.666 --> 57:44.125
But when you do, it's a good feeling.

57:44.125 --> 57:45.250
I see.

57:45.250 --> 57:48.000
Well, the king and pope
believe you are dead

57:48.000 --> 57:50.958
and seem content with that
given the secrets that you held.

57:51.750 --> 57:54.083
- Your plan worked.
- Our plan.

57:56.333 --> 57:58.958
Um, I've spoken to my family in England,

57:58.958 --> 58:00.791
and they will help us get out
of the country.

58:00.791 --> 58:02.541
Yo-You will not be queen?

58:02.541 --> 58:05.750
The king's sole intention is
to expand his power.

58:06.375 --> 58:08.208
After that he'll have no use for me.

58:08.833 --> 58:11.208
He is merciless, self-centered, and petty.

58:12.750 --> 58:14.583
You'd make a far better king than he.

58:17.375 --> 58:19.583
Okay, my queen. That's a good one.

58:19.583 --> 58:24.708
It is true! I saw your oyster rebellion.
You are a leader.

58:24.708 --> 58:25.791
No.

58:25.791 --> 58:29.041
I just believe everyone should have
the opportunity to eat oysters.

58:29.041 --> 58:31.625
And I see your kindness.

58:31.625 --> 58:33.666
That is why I am drawn to you.

58:34.500 --> 58:36.125
That's a lot to digest.

58:36.125 --> 58:37.583
Oh, speaking of which,

58:38.083 --> 58:39.625
- I brought some food.
- Oh.

58:39.625 --> 58:41.125
Including, of course,

58:41.708 --> 58:43.666
- Belon oysters.

58:43.666 --> 58:44.916
Let's sup.

58:44.916 --> 58:45.958
Aha!

58:50.125 --> 58:51.458
Oh, yes.

59:05.375 --> 59:09.708
You're right. This is strangely satisfying
and validating.

59:12.708 --> 59:15.125
I don't want to, but I must go now.

59:15.125 --> 59:16.708
- No, please don't.
- I have to.

59:16.708 --> 59:17.791
No!

59:20.000 --> 59:22.083
- Mmm.

59:22.083 --> 59:24.791
- Thank goodness I got that ticket.

59:24.791 --> 59:26.500
Oh, yeah.

59:35.375 --> 59:38.000
Mmm. That was my ticket.

59:38.750 --> 59:41.750
I deserved that ticket, and he took it.

59:41.750 --> 59:43.041
He took my ticket from me.

59:43.041 --> 59:45.000
He's a ticket-taker, that's what he is.

59:46.041 --> 59:47.041
Mmm.

59:54.416 --> 59:56.833
That is delicious Cabernet.

59:59.541 --> 1:00:00.833
Whoo.

1:00:00.833 --> 1:00:03.041
Hey, did you throw that bottle?

1:00:08.166 --> 1:00:09.291
Duchamp?

1:00:09.291 --> 1:00:12.541
Oh, hey. Hey, you kids. Get out of here.

1:00:12.541 --> 1:00:14.916
These stupid kids,
they're just throwing bottles at doors.

1:00:14.916 --> 1:00:16.458
Those little sons of bitches.

1:00:16.458 --> 1:00:18.250
There's no respect for anything.

1:00:18.250 --> 1:00:19.416
Fuck you!

1:00:19.416 --> 1:00:21.083
How's the hero doing, eh?

1:00:21.083 --> 1:00:22.250
Yeah, you know, it's okay.

1:00:22.250 --> 1:00:23.333
You did the right thing.

1:00:23.333 --> 1:00:26.000
I never had a good feeling
about that creepy hunchback.

1:00:26.000 --> 1:00:27.875
- You want a sip of my bladder?
- No, no, no.

1:00:27.875 --> 1:00:30.000
Just take a pull of my bladder.
Suck it. Take a suck.

1:00:30.000 --> 1:00:31.458
- I'm cool. I'm on the clock.
- No?

1:00:31.458 --> 1:00:32.708
Bladder.

1:00:32.708 --> 1:00:35.916
- I know, it's funny. It's a funny word.
- Right? It's a good thing you said--

1:00:35.916 --> 1:00:37.333
Hey, you know something else?

1:00:37.333 --> 1:00:38.750
I gave him that ticket.

1:00:38.750 --> 1:00:41.208
I know. And you got him the job
at the torture chamber.

1:00:41.208 --> 1:00:42.750
I got him a job at torture chamber.

1:00:42.750 --> 1:00:45.916
You're better off with that guy dead,
Duchamp. That guy was dragging you down.

1:00:45.916 --> 1:00:48.416
You know what? He gets everything
handed to him, that guy.

1:00:48.416 --> 1:00:51.625
He always comes up smelling like roses,
you know?

1:00:51.625 --> 1:00:54.666
Well, if you consider being dead
coming up roses, you know...

1:00:54.666 --> 1:00:56.791
Well, let me tell you something.
He's not dead.

1:00:56.791 --> 1:00:58.583
Can you believe that?

1:00:58.583 --> 1:00:59.750
That's the bladder talking.

1:00:59.750 --> 1:01:01.250
No, I'm serious. He's still alive.

1:01:01.250 --> 1:01:03.875
- He's out at that old cave by the lake.
- Yeah.

1:01:03.875 --> 1:01:07.333
Yeah. Don't say anything, though,
'cause loose lips take shits.

1:01:07.333 --> 1:01:09.625
Wait, wait, wait. I saw him die.

1:01:09.625 --> 1:01:14.500
No, no, no. It was all bullshit.
It was a ruse.

1:01:14.500 --> 1:01:16.083
You're telling me it was a <i>charade?</i>

1:01:16.083 --> 1:01:18.458
It was a <i>charade.</i>

1:01:18.458 --> 1:01:20.791
Yeah, oh, boy, okay. Hold on a second.

1:01:20.791 --> 1:01:24.041
Everything's spinning. I gotta be careful
not to puke on my boots.

1:01:25.250 --> 1:01:26.250
Okay, all right.

1:01:27.250 --> 1:01:29.375
Good night to you too, you asshole.

1:01:38.791 --> 1:01:42.000
Duchamp. You'll never guess what happened.

1:01:42.000 --> 1:01:43.958
Oh, Duchamp, I've got great news.

1:01:45.541 --> 1:01:48.708
Don't keep us waiting, Hunchback.
Tell us the great news.

1:01:49.333 --> 1:01:52.125
Did you discover that your hump is filled
with gold bullion?

1:01:57.416 --> 1:02:02.333
Yes, Lucien, you're right.
The king will be very, very happy.

1:02:02.333 --> 1:02:04.833
And this dickwad will finally get
what he deserves.

1:02:04.833 --> 1:02:07.291
Why don't you do your little chant now, huh?

1:02:07.291 --> 1:02:10.583
Oysters. Oysters. Oysters. Oysters.

1:02:10.583 --> 1:02:12.166
- Seize him.

1:02:21.166 --> 1:02:23.375
So, you have anything to say for yourself?

1:02:23.375 --> 1:02:25.541
I thought I would start
by telling the truth,

1:02:25.541 --> 1:02:27.875
- which is that who I was trying to kill--
- Silence!

1:02:29.000 --> 1:02:32.250
How dare you question the power
of your king?

1:02:32.250 --> 1:02:33.541
Or the glory of your pope?

1:02:33.541 --> 1:02:35.458
- Gag him.
- Yes.

1:02:35.458 --> 1:02:37.416
Put one of your balls in his mouth.

1:02:38.666 --> 1:02:43.875
You're only alive so we can publicly
execute you tomorrow at the coronation.

1:02:45.833 --> 1:02:47.583
But in the meantime,

1:02:48.208 --> 1:02:51.625
perhaps a stretch on the old rack
would be apropos.

1:02:51.625 --> 1:02:52.750
Good idea, sire.

1:02:52.750 --> 1:02:54.083
Is it?

1:02:55.333 --> 1:02:58.916
Now, uh, I have no idea how this works.

1:02:58.916 --> 1:03:00.916
Of course, you don't, you cake-eater.

1:03:01.916 --> 1:03:05.625
Shall we see if we can't make his final
night of sleep a little less comfortable?

1:03:10.750 --> 1:03:12.000
Good show, Your Grace.

1:03:12.000 --> 1:03:13.166
Was it?

1:03:18.583 --> 1:03:19.541
Oh.

1:03:19.541 --> 1:03:21.875
Oh, well, now, uh, aren't you something?

1:03:23.000 --> 1:03:24.750
What's your name? Lorelai?

1:03:25.333 --> 1:03:29.000
Oh, that is a lovely dress you're wearing.
So sheer.

1:03:29.000 --> 1:03:31.208
What a funny thing to run into you
out here

1:03:32.083 --> 1:03:34.958
picking elderberries
in such a gossamer gown.

1:03:35.958 --> 1:03:38.750
Is that a couple of eggplants,
or are you just happy to see me?

1:03:38.750 --> 1:03:40.208
- I love eggplants.

1:03:40.208 --> 1:03:41.875
Oh. [chuckles] My queen.

1:03:42.958 --> 1:03:44.041
Oh, you must be lost.

1:03:44.041 --> 1:03:47.875
Um, the perfume cellar is actually,
if you go down the hallway, it's...

1:03:47.875 --> 1:03:50.583
My, look at this painting.

1:03:51.500 --> 1:03:53.833
Look how red her cheeks are.

1:03:53.833 --> 1:03:55.416
Scandalous.

1:03:55.416 --> 1:03:57.916
They're not mine.
I found these in the-- In the woods.

1:03:57.916 --> 1:03:59.416
- Mmm.
- Um. So, no.

1:03:59.416 --> 1:04:01.500
I bet you're here for gown storage.

1:04:01.500 --> 1:04:03.041
That's actually the-the Gautier wing.

1:04:03.041 --> 1:04:05.333
I'm not looking for gown storage.

1:04:05.333 --> 1:04:06.416
Okay, well, then,

1:04:07.125 --> 1:04:10.500
if you seek neither gown storage
nor the perfume cellar, then...

1:04:11.791 --> 1:04:14.291
Well, then the only possible explanation,

1:04:14.291 --> 1:04:16.916
- if I may be so bold...

1:04:16.916 --> 1:04:21.291
...is that you came to visit <i>moi</i>?

1:04:37.916 --> 1:04:39.750
I think you just fell for me.

1:04:44.166 --> 1:04:47.208
Now I've got you right where I want you,
you filthy little thing.

1:04:47.208 --> 1:04:48.458
Catherine!

1:04:48.458 --> 1:04:49.541
I'm joking.

1:04:50.541 --> 1:04:53.166
- We must get you out of here.

1:04:53.166 --> 1:04:55.083
Oh, please do.

1:04:55.083 --> 1:04:57.916
I implemented the notes you gave me
on the rack,

1:04:57.916 --> 1:05:00.458
and I must say,
they worked really, really well.

1:05:00.458 --> 1:05:02.958
This thing hurts like a motherfucker.

1:05:02.958 --> 1:05:04.666
Thank you, Quasi.

1:05:06.000 --> 1:05:08.125
I will repay you for this.

1:05:08.125 --> 1:05:11.083
I swear on the souls of both my mothers.

1:05:12.583 --> 1:05:13.833
You had two mothers?

1:05:14.625 --> 1:05:16.583
Yeah, they were Siamese twins.

1:05:16.583 --> 1:05:17.750
I never knew 'em.

1:05:17.750 --> 1:05:20.750
As a babe, they put me in a sack
and tossed me in the river.

1:05:20.750 --> 1:05:24.125
My aunt was a Siamese twin.
Well, my aunts.

1:05:24.750 --> 1:05:28.375
When I was a child,
they produced a hideously deformed baby

1:05:28.375 --> 1:05:30.375
with their brother,
the <i>vicomte de Gastineau.</i>

1:05:30.375 --> 1:05:33.333
- Uh-huh.
- And they threw the baby in the river.

1:05:33.333 --> 1:05:34.541
Huh. That's weird.

1:05:34.541 --> 1:05:36.000
Let me see your back.

1:05:36.583 --> 1:05:38.375
Oh, no, it is not a pretty sight.

1:05:38.375 --> 1:05:39.625
- Let me see your back.
- Milady.

1:05:39.625 --> 1:05:41.416
Oh. Oh. As you wish, my lady.

1:05:42.291 --> 1:05:44.791
-<i>Mon Dieu!</i>
- All right, it's not that bad.

1:05:44.791 --> 1:05:47.708
- The mark of the Gastineau!
- Come again?

1:05:47.708 --> 1:05:51.333
Your birthmark is the mark
of the Gastineau.

1:05:51.333 --> 1:05:52.750
Do you know what this means?

1:05:52.750 --> 1:05:56.791
That I have a deformity
on top of my deformity?

1:05:56.791 --> 1:05:58.708
You and I are

1:05:59.375 --> 1:06:00.375
cousins.

1:06:00.375 --> 1:06:05.291
Pfft! <i>Non</i>. Cousins? <i>Impossible.</i>

1:06:05.291 --> 1:06:06.541
<i>Oui</i>, look.

1:06:06.541 --> 1:06:07.625
Huh?

1:06:08.458 --> 1:06:12.375
<i>Mon Dieu!</i> It's just like mine.

1:06:15.375 --> 1:06:17.916
I knew I was attracted to you
for a reason.

1:06:17.916 --> 1:06:20.208
I thought it was your honor
and compassion,

1:06:20.208 --> 1:06:24.958
but now I know
it's also because we share the same blood.

1:06:24.958 --> 1:06:28.250
Yeah, I was attracted to you
'cause you're super hot.

1:06:28.250 --> 1:06:33.166
But now that I know we're cousins,
it's really awesome.

1:06:35.041 --> 1:06:36.791
- Um, my mouth is...
- Hmm?

1:06:36.791 --> 1:06:38.750
- Um, like this?
- Yeah.

1:06:38.750 --> 1:06:41.375
Um, okay.

1:06:41.375 --> 1:06:43.000
- Mm-hmm. Mmm. Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.

1:06:44.958 --> 1:06:46.916
Oh, your hump is so hard.

1:06:46.916 --> 1:06:50.916
It seems to be getting harder.

1:06:57.875 --> 1:07:00.625
Sire, sire, it is time.

1:07:01.125 --> 1:07:03.708
What?

1:07:03.708 --> 1:07:04.833
It's time.

1:07:04.833 --> 1:07:07.833
Time for you to get out of my bedchamber.

1:07:07.833 --> 1:07:11.166
No, sire, it's half past the cock's crow.

1:07:11.791 --> 1:07:14.250
Half past the cock's crow?

1:07:14.250 --> 1:07:17.375
Oh. We have a hunchback to kill.

1:07:17.375 --> 1:07:18.833
Yes, I like it.

1:07:22.291 --> 1:07:25.916
I stood up too fast. I'm all <i>désorienté.</i>

1:07:25.916 --> 1:07:27.166
Take it slow, sire.

1:07:27.166 --> 1:07:28.958
- Come on, I will dress you.
- Thank you.

1:07:35.458 --> 1:07:38.208
Oh, yes.

1:07:43.291 --> 1:07:45.166
Torture me with your body.

1:07:45.666 --> 1:07:48.625
Yeah. Mmm. Okay.

1:07:53.083 --> 1:07:55.500
- You want another?
- Please.

1:07:55.500 --> 1:07:59.250
We shall kill Mr. Modo before
he has a chance to blab of our plan.

1:08:00.625 --> 1:08:03.583
Guy, what are you doing up?
It's half past the cock's crow.

1:08:03.583 --> 1:08:07.000
I couldn't sleep,
so I decided to take a brisk walk.

1:08:07.000 --> 1:08:09.750
I seem to remember you
being able to sleep through anything.

1:08:09.750 --> 1:08:11.583
Well, what are you doing up?

1:08:11.583 --> 1:08:17.791
I am going to administer last rites
to the prisoner, as is God's wish.

1:08:17.791 --> 1:08:20.916
Oh, last rites. I've always wanted to see
what that's about.

1:08:20.916 --> 1:08:24.875
Ooh, sorry. Final confession
is only between sheep and shepherd.

1:08:24.875 --> 1:08:26.000
Well, I want to know, too.

1:08:26.000 --> 1:08:28.000
God would like you to fuck off
and go back to bed.

1:08:28.000 --> 1:08:29.291
My dungeon, my rules.

1:08:32.416 --> 1:08:34.125
- Um, question.
- Mmm.

1:08:34.125 --> 1:08:37.625
If you and I are cousins,
does not that make me royalty?

1:08:37.625 --> 1:08:42.333
Yes. You are in the line of kings.

1:08:43.041 --> 1:08:45.541
Now, enter me with your royal member.

1:08:45.541 --> 1:08:51.583
My lady, I'm new at this.
Enter you... where?

1:08:56.208 --> 1:08:57.250
<i>Qu'est-ce que c'est</i>?

1:09:12.750 --> 1:09:13.958
Oh, no!

1:09:13.958 --> 1:09:16.625
- My queen!

1:09:16.625 --> 1:09:18.125
Thank God you're finally here.

1:09:18.125 --> 1:09:20.083
- What happened?

1:09:20.083 --> 1:09:24.541
Well, he called to me with his siren song.
I was hypnotized.

1:09:24.541 --> 1:09:27.125
I have heard tell
of the sweet song of the hunchback.

1:09:27.125 --> 1:09:31.208
Then he strapped me here and left
hours ago. So many, many hours.

1:09:32.666 --> 1:09:34.750
Let's go!
Out of the way!

1:09:37.125 --> 1:09:40.000
Okay, fine.

1:09:41.750 --> 1:09:42.958
Assholes.

1:09:47.375 --> 1:09:50.000
That was something.

1:09:50.000 --> 1:09:53.250
Indeed. Yes, you must be so relieved
that the queen is safe.

1:09:53.250 --> 1:09:54.625
Of course, of course.

1:09:54.625 --> 1:09:58.708
But you must be terrified with that
lumpy little maniac on the loose.

1:09:58.708 --> 1:10:01.291
Why should I be terrified?
You should be terrified, not me.

1:10:01.291 --> 1:10:05.041
I'm not terrified. You heard the queen.
He's long gone.

1:10:05.041 --> 1:10:07.083
There's no way we're going to...

1:10:07.083 --> 1:10:08.416
Catch him.

1:10:08.416 --> 1:10:09.916
Ah, yes, of course.

1:10:09.916 --> 1:10:12.250
So it's really no big deal then
if we never do...

1:10:12.250 --> 1:10:14.000
Find him.

1:10:16.208 --> 1:10:18.208
Find him and kill him.
What?

1:10:18.958 --> 1:10:21.000
Find that little shit
and kill him.

1:10:21.000 --> 1:10:23.125
You want me
to go take a shit?

1:10:23.125 --> 1:10:24.541
Why? Do you have to?

1:10:24.541 --> 1:10:26.500
- I don't have to.
- Then why would you?

1:10:26.500 --> 1:10:30.500
Find him
and catch him so he does not speak.

1:10:30.500 --> 1:10:32.333
Bind his ankles to his cheeks?

1:10:32.333 --> 1:10:33.375
Quasi.

1:10:33.375 --> 1:10:35.416
- Oh, the little hunchback?
- Yes.

1:10:35.416 --> 1:10:39.250
You can't call them hunchback.
You have to say orthopedically challenged.

1:10:39.250 --> 1:10:42.000
- My apologies. Yes.
- No, no, no, it's a whole, you know.

1:10:42.000 --> 1:10:43.333
Yes.

1:10:48.375 --> 1:10:50.375
Weird weather we're having.

1:10:50.375 --> 1:10:54.666
I know, I know,
we were just saying that. So weird, weird.

1:11:00.500 --> 1:11:02.916
Ah, garlic, I-- Mmm.

1:11:02.916 --> 1:11:04.750
You know what would be great?
Maybe some Brie.

1:11:06.708 --> 1:11:08.750
Oh, these top shelves are so handy.

1:11:11.000 --> 1:11:12.000
Michel.

1:11:12.000 --> 1:11:13.375
Quasi.

1:11:13.375 --> 1:11:15.333
Whoa, you are fuckin' tall, <i>mon frére.</i>

1:11:15.333 --> 1:11:19.250
Things are very <i>dangereuse,</i> Quasi.

1:11:19.250 --> 1:11:22.750
Then it's <i>dangereuse</i> for Duchamp as well.
I need to warn him.

1:11:22.750 --> 1:11:27.625
Let's rendezvous at Dupont Fork
in one hour.

1:11:27.625 --> 1:11:30.541
I'm rendezvousing
with Queen Catherine there as well.

1:11:31.458 --> 1:11:34.125
Name drop much?

1:11:36.666 --> 1:11:39.000
Duchamp! <i>Mon Dieu!</i>

1:11:41.250 --> 1:11:43.416
Duchamp, I am so sorry.

1:11:45.958 --> 1:11:47.541
Holy shit, it's bright.

1:11:47.541 --> 1:11:50.000
- Du! Get up.

1:11:50.000 --> 1:11:52.583
- Oh, my fuckin' head.
- Get up!

1:11:52.583 --> 1:11:56.416
Oh, God.
What are you, weighing in at 19 stone?

1:11:56.416 --> 1:12:02.000
Okay. My balance is-- is-- is-- <i>fakakte</i>.
Okay. Oh, Jesus.

1:12:02.000 --> 1:12:03.458
- Are you drunk?
Hold on.

1:12:03.458 --> 1:12:05.458
What are you doing here?
Shouldn't you be in that cave?

1:12:05.458 --> 1:12:10.083
Du, so many incredible things have
happened since we saw each other last.

1:12:10.083 --> 1:12:11.291
Oh, yeah, let me guess.

1:12:11.291 --> 1:12:13.666
You won another lottery,
and you rode a dragon

1:12:13.666 --> 1:12:16.333
- to the top of <i>Mont</i> Ménage à Trois.
- No.

1:12:16.333 --> 1:12:18.125
- You sixty-nined a unicorn.
- No.

1:12:18.125 --> 1:12:19.833
You slid down a rainbow
into a chocolate river.

1:12:19.833 --> 1:12:21.125
- Okay--
- Where there was an orgy.

1:12:21.125 --> 1:12:22.250
- Okay, Duch--
- With wizards.

1:12:22.250 --> 1:12:25.458
No. I was captured by the king.

1:12:25.458 --> 1:12:29.291
And then, my new lover,
Queen Catherine, freed me.

1:12:29.291 --> 1:12:31.791
We're running away together
to the Amalfi Coast.

1:12:31.791 --> 1:12:34.375
And then,
it's off to Barcelona in wintertime.

1:12:34.375 --> 1:12:35.750
Listen to yourself.

1:12:35.750 --> 1:12:37.458
My new lover, Queen Catherine?

1:12:37.458 --> 1:12:39.291
- Yeah.
- Barcelona?

1:12:39.291 --> 1:12:41.541
Oh, I also learned
that I'm cousin to the queen.

1:12:41.541 --> 1:12:42.625
Oh, come on!

1:12:42.625 --> 1:12:44.250
Okay, look, we gotta go.

1:12:44.250 --> 1:12:46.666
You're lucky the guards didn't grab you
at the cave last night.

1:12:46.666 --> 1:12:48.083
I have no idea how they found me.

1:12:48.083 --> 1:12:51.166
Only the queen, Michel,
and you knew about that cave.

1:12:51.166 --> 1:12:53.458
But none of you
would ever tell anybody about that.

1:12:53.458 --> 1:12:56.791
Well, I-I-- I may have told one person.

1:12:57.375 --> 1:12:58.625
What?

1:12:58.625 --> 1:13:01.666
And that person may have been Lucien.

1:13:01.666 --> 1:13:03.083
Why would you do that?

1:13:03.083 --> 1:13:05.166
'Cause the plan didn't work.

1:13:05.708 --> 1:13:08.291
I was supposed to be the hero,
but you were!

1:13:08.291 --> 1:13:12.833
And then I went to the cave, and I saw you
in there with the queen, laughing.

1:13:12.833 --> 1:13:15.875
So you told Lucien?
Didn't you realize what would happen?

1:13:15.875 --> 1:13:17.166
That was my ticket.

1:13:17.166 --> 1:13:19.958
Duchamp, you betrayed me.

1:13:19.958 --> 1:13:23.083
I used to be the big swinging dick
in this relationship.

1:13:23.083 --> 1:13:27.250
You were just sad, lonely Quasi,
and I was big, jolly Duchamp.

1:13:27.250 --> 1:13:28.583
Everyone knew my name.

1:13:29.083 --> 1:13:32.291
"How's it hangin', Champ?
What's up, Duch?"

1:13:32.291 --> 1:13:35.041
I didn't have to be your friend.
I took pity on you.

1:13:35.041 --> 1:13:38.291
Okay, well,
let me tell you something, Duchamp.

1:13:39.583 --> 1:13:42.083
You may have once been
the big swinging dick,

1:13:42.083 --> 1:13:45.458
but now that big swinging dick
has swung back in the other direction.

1:13:45.458 --> 1:13:47.500
And I can tell you one thing for sure.

1:13:47.500 --> 1:13:49.625
I never would have betrayed
my best friend.

1:13:49.625 --> 1:13:51.958
Well, that's perfect,
'cause we're not best friends.

1:13:51.958 --> 1:13:53.833
You put a knife in my back.

1:13:57.000 --> 1:13:58.416
Get him!

1:14:05.875 --> 1:14:06.875
Stop him!

1:14:14.833 --> 1:14:16.541
Get him!

1:14:51.333 --> 1:14:52.416
Merde!

1:15:07.125 --> 1:15:10.875
Let go of me! Let go of me!
Hey! Let go of me!

1:15:14.166 --> 1:15:15.625
Get off of me!

1:15:15.625 --> 1:15:18.541
Oh, God, I'm so hungover. Come on.

1:15:25.250 --> 1:15:29.500
Behold, the best friend
to the criminal Quasi.

1:15:29.500 --> 1:15:30.916
What? We're not friends.

1:15:30.916 --> 1:15:33.375
I stopped him from killing the king.
I was the hero.

1:15:33.375 --> 1:15:34.458
What are you talking about?

1:15:34.458 --> 1:15:37.125
Up there on the stage. I stopped him.

1:15:37.125 --> 1:15:38.458
Does anyone here remember that?

1:15:38.458 --> 1:15:41.791
I definitely remember
the handsome hunchback.

1:15:41.791 --> 1:15:44.125
Are you kidding me?
It happened right there.

1:15:44.125 --> 1:15:46.375
Where is the hunchback?

1:15:46.916 --> 1:15:48.000
I have no idea.

1:15:48.000 --> 1:15:52.625
Well, perhaps a public torturing at
the coronation will refresh your memory.

1:15:55.875 --> 1:15:59.541
Unless, of course,
the hunchback is here listening.

1:16:01.375 --> 1:16:05.208
Perhaps he'd like to show himself
to save his best friend.

1:16:05.958 --> 1:16:10.250
I told you, he's not my friend.
I hate that twisted, creepy virgin.

1:16:10.250 --> 1:16:11.625
He's not a virgin anymore!

1:16:11.625 --> 1:16:14.375
Who said that? Show yourself.

1:16:15.541 --> 1:16:17.166
- Enough. Take him away.
Yes, sire.

1:16:17.166 --> 1:16:21.291
Wait, hold on, okay, hold on. We can talk
about this, right? Hold on. Hold on.

1:16:21.291 --> 1:16:24.500
Leave me alone.
Where are you taking me?

1:16:24.500 --> 1:16:27.333
Stop! Stop it!

1:16:46.916 --> 1:16:47.916
Michel.

1:16:47.916 --> 1:16:49.250
Ah, Quasi. How'd you see me?

1:16:49.250 --> 1:16:51.583
What are you talking about? I see
your head sticking out of the bush.

1:16:51.583 --> 1:16:52.791
You should try hiding.

1:16:52.791 --> 1:16:55.500
I am hiding. I'm behind a bush.
It's like the tallest bush in the forest.

1:16:55.500 --> 1:16:57.208
Yeah, okay, come on. We gotta go.

1:16:59.000 --> 1:17:01.125
We have a long journey ahead of us.

1:17:01.625 --> 1:17:03.500
Here, I think it's this way. Yeah.

1:17:04.708 --> 1:17:06.750
Hey, I brought a little food
for our journey.

1:17:08.708 --> 1:17:11.000
You're bleeding.

1:17:11.000 --> 1:17:16.208
Oh, yeah. It was a knife from the guards.
Stuck in the fatty deposit of my hump.

1:17:16.208 --> 1:17:17.875
Thank goodness for this thing, huh?

1:17:19.500 --> 1:17:21.041
The queen.

1:17:21.041 --> 1:17:22.125
Catherine.

1:17:22.125 --> 1:17:23.833
I saw your friend's head above the brush.

1:17:23.833 --> 1:17:25.250
I don't think it was me.

1:17:29.625 --> 1:17:30.666
You guys weren't kidding.

1:17:32.250 --> 1:17:34.958
Oh, my, you're particularly ripe today.

1:17:34.958 --> 1:17:36.458
It's been a busy day.

1:17:39.000 --> 1:17:40.666
Oh, my God. You're wounded.

1:17:40.666 --> 1:17:43.666
Oh, no, no, no. I'm fine.
My hump stopped the guard's knife.

1:17:43.666 --> 1:17:45.375
Thank goodness for your hump!

1:17:45.375 --> 1:17:46.583
My hump is great!

1:17:46.583 --> 1:17:49.041
Oh, now you're free
to go start your new life.

1:17:49.708 --> 1:17:50.875
Here are your supplies.

1:17:50.875 --> 1:17:53.500
But you're not coming?

1:17:53.500 --> 1:17:55.291
They know you're alive.

1:17:55.958 --> 1:17:58.583
If I go with you, they'll undoubtedly
find us and kill us both.

1:17:59.500 --> 1:18:01.791
I will stay
and go through with the coronation.

1:18:01.791 --> 1:18:03.875
The king killed his last wife.

1:18:03.875 --> 1:18:07.291
He'll need me for a while
to solidify his alliance.

1:18:07.291 --> 1:18:11.125
Before I become obsolete, perhaps
I can find a way to change my fortunes.

1:18:11.125 --> 1:18:12.416
I cannot let you do this.

1:18:12.416 --> 1:18:15.000
There's no other way. You must go now.

1:18:15.500 --> 1:18:17.291
The ferryman waits for you
at Canard's Crossing.

1:18:17.291 --> 1:18:19.208
He will go without you.

1:18:19.208 --> 1:18:20.666
Here's some money.

1:18:20.666 --> 1:18:21.750
Catherine.

1:18:21.750 --> 1:18:23.541
You must go now. Please.

1:18:23.541 --> 1:18:26.500
What about Barcelona?

1:18:26.500 --> 1:18:29.125
Perhaps Barcelona is in our future.

1:18:30.250 --> 1:18:34.000
But for now, farewell, Quasi.

1:18:54.291 --> 1:18:55.291
We should get going.

1:18:55.291 --> 1:18:58.083
- Where's Duchamp?
- Captured by the guards.

1:18:58.083 --> 1:19:00.916
Captured? Well, we have to go help him.
He'll be tortured.

1:19:00.916 --> 1:19:03.541
- There is nothing we can do.
- He's your best friend.

1:19:03.541 --> 1:19:05.125
He is not my best friend!

1:19:05.125 --> 1:19:06.750
Well, he gave you
the winning lottery ticket.

1:19:06.750 --> 1:19:07.958
That sounds like a best friend.

1:19:07.958 --> 1:19:10.791
He helped you fake your death to save
your life. That sounds like a best friend.

1:19:10.791 --> 1:19:14.833
He betrayed me, and the last thing he said
when he was captured by the guards

1:19:14.833 --> 1:19:16.291
was that he was not my friend.

1:19:16.291 --> 1:19:19.458
And he called me a creepy, twisted virgin.

1:19:20.541 --> 1:19:22.041
I am not a virgin anymore!

1:19:22.041 --> 1:19:26.250
- Who'd you have sex with?
-<i>Bonjour</i>, read the room.

1:19:28.333 --> 1:19:29.500
- Yeah.
- Quasi,

1:19:29.500 --> 1:19:32.666
of course, Duchamp said mean things
about you so you wouldn't try to help him.

1:19:32.666 --> 1:19:39.166
He said it to save you
because he is your best friend.

1:19:43.291 --> 1:19:44.291
Fuck him.

1:20:01.833 --> 1:20:07.041
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome
to the coronation of your new queen!

1:20:14.375 --> 1:20:18.916
Why am I walking? I am the guest of honor.
I should be in a gilded carriage.

1:20:18.916 --> 1:20:20.875
You're lucky you were even invited.

1:20:24.291 --> 1:20:27.416
Sire, what have you heard
of the escaped hunchback?

1:20:27.416 --> 1:20:30.958
No news. Apparently, he's in the wind.

1:20:30.958 --> 1:20:34.208
Yes, he seems gone,
so you have nothing to worry about

1:20:34.708 --> 1:20:36.875
until your husband leaves you
face down in a moat.

1:20:36.875 --> 1:20:38.625
Oh, pretty flowers, yes.

1:20:38.625 --> 1:20:40.333
I beg your pardon, Holy One?

1:20:40.916 --> 1:20:42.666
JK, JK.

1:21:00.541 --> 1:21:02.666
And now, on to the entertainment.

1:21:02.666 --> 1:21:04.791
We have a delightful opening act.

1:21:05.625 --> 1:21:10.750
The torture and disembowelment
of the traitor Duchamp Rousseau.

1:21:13.166 --> 1:21:14.458
Get off of me.

1:21:16.375 --> 1:21:19.041
Get off!

1:21:19.041 --> 1:21:20.583
You traitor!

1:21:21.166 --> 1:21:22.833
That's Quasi's hut mate.

1:21:22.833 --> 1:21:25.333
Um, apparently,
he needed a place closer to town,

1:21:25.333 --> 1:21:27.708
and Quasi needed somebody
to share the rent or something like that.

1:21:28.416 --> 1:21:31.333
This will all be over quickly
if you just tell us what we want to know.

1:21:31.333 --> 1:21:35.416
Ha! I torture people for a living.
You guys are amateurs.

1:21:35.416 --> 1:21:42.208
As you wish. I will ask you again.
Duchamp Rousseau, where is the hunchback?

1:21:42.208 --> 1:21:45.875
Suck <i>mon</i> dick.

1:21:49.458 --> 1:21:52.458
Well, that should be quite easy to do

1:21:52.458 --> 1:21:54.833
with your scrotum nailed
to that tree stump.

1:21:54.833 --> 1:21:56.500
- Guards.

1:21:56.500 --> 1:21:57.916
What?

1:21:57.916 --> 1:22:00.666
Scrotum! Scrotum! Scrotum!

1:22:00.666 --> 1:22:02.333
Hold on a second, guys, hold on.

1:22:02.333 --> 1:22:04.041
Scrotum! Scrotum! Scrotum!

1:22:06.958 --> 1:22:09.583
Ow, ow, ow, okay, okay, hold on.
You don't have to do this.

1:22:14.416 --> 1:22:16.208
Ooh, I feel it in my balls.

1:22:16.208 --> 1:22:17.583
I feel it in my throat.

1:22:17.583 --> 1:22:18.666
And how does that feel?

1:22:18.666 --> 1:22:21.416
Frankly, it tickles.

1:22:21.416 --> 1:22:23.625
Ah, tickles.

1:22:23.625 --> 1:22:25.458
Guards, prepare the disembowelment.

1:22:29.416 --> 1:22:30.500
Oh, boy.

1:22:30.500 --> 1:22:34.041
Your Majesty, surely we should not mar
our joyful celebration

1:22:34.041 --> 1:22:35.125
with such barbarism.

1:22:35.125 --> 1:22:38.333
Oh, poppet,
do let us have a little bit of fun.

1:22:41.500 --> 1:22:42.916
<i>Bonjour</i>, assholes.

1:22:49.166 --> 1:22:51.166
Oh.

1:22:51.166 --> 1:22:54.666
Why don't you "douchebaguettes"
pick on someone half your size?

1:22:55.916 --> 1:22:57.458
- Quasi!
- Hunchback.

1:23:00.791 --> 1:23:02.416
<i>Mon Dieu!</i>

1:23:02.416 --> 1:23:05.208
Did you nail his scrotum to a tree stump?

1:23:05.208 --> 1:23:06.708
What is wrong with you people?

1:23:06.708 --> 1:23:12.333
Hunchback, you've taken our bait.
You're far outnumbered. Guards!

1:23:18.208 --> 1:23:19.750
- Hi, guys.
- Michel!

1:23:19.750 --> 1:23:21.750
- Is that your scrotum?
- Yeah.

1:23:24.000 --> 1:23:25.833
Hurry, Quasi. Release your friend.

1:23:26.583 --> 1:23:29.041
- What?
- Yes, get me out of here.

1:23:29.041 --> 1:23:31.250
Hang on.
- Shoot me and your alliance dies, Guy.

1:23:31.250 --> 1:23:33.375
Let's not shoot the queen then.

1:23:33.375 --> 1:23:36.166
- We gotta go.
- There. That's it.

1:23:36.166 --> 1:23:37.500
- Hold on.
What?

1:23:37.500 --> 1:23:38.750
- Ooh.

1:23:38.750 --> 1:23:40.625
Sire, shall we kill the others?

1:23:40.625 --> 1:23:44.166
No. Capture them alive
so we can torture them together.

1:23:44.166 --> 1:23:45.458
Of course, sire.

1:23:45.458 --> 1:23:47.583
Send a warning shot.
Shoot over their heads.

1:23:47.583 --> 1:23:49.958
- Yes, milord.
- Oh, boy.

1:23:49.958 --> 1:23:52.083
Ooh.

1:23:52.083 --> 1:23:53.833
Get the nail out.

1:23:55.708 --> 1:23:58.166
No, Michel!

1:23:58.166 --> 1:23:59.333
Why?

1:24:01.125 --> 1:24:02.708
Whoops.

1:24:02.708 --> 1:24:04.291
I said shoot over their heads.

1:24:04.291 --> 1:24:06.416
I don't think any of us
thought he was that tall.

1:24:07.958 --> 1:24:09.583
Michel, hang in there.

1:24:10.666 --> 1:24:14.541
In the seven-course meal of life,
this is my crème brûlée.

1:24:15.583 --> 1:24:17.291
- So promise me something.
- Name it.

1:24:17.291 --> 1:24:20.916
I've never seen the equal of
the friendship that you and Duchamp share.

1:24:21.583 --> 1:24:25.958
You are best friends.
Promise me that you will be forever.

1:24:25.958 --> 1:24:28.541
I promise we will be best friends.

1:24:28.541 --> 1:24:29.875
As do I.

1:24:29.875 --> 1:24:31.833
Not BFs, but BFFs.

1:24:31.833 --> 1:24:33.541
Forever.

1:24:33.541 --> 1:24:35.666
You know,
I'm not even sure that that was my arrow.

1:24:35.666 --> 1:24:37.208
I saw it come out of your crossbow.

1:24:37.208 --> 1:24:39.125
You know what? That was Gregor's. Gregor!

1:24:39.708 --> 1:24:42.583
Duchamp, Michel helped me realize

1:24:42.583 --> 1:24:44.916
that when you told Henri
that you were not my friend,

1:24:44.916 --> 1:24:50.625
you were doing it to save me
because you are my friend.

1:24:51.958 --> 1:24:55.458
No, I wasn't. I was fucking pissed at you.

1:24:56.083 --> 1:24:58.083
But that would have been really cool
if I thought of that.

1:24:58.750 --> 1:24:59.750
I'm-- I'm sorry.

1:25:00.333 --> 1:25:03.541
I'm not mad at you for what you did.
I'm mad at you for lying about it.

1:25:03.541 --> 1:25:04.666
I'm really sorry, milord.

1:25:04.666 --> 1:25:06.208
Sit in the carriage.
I'll talk to you later.

1:25:06.208 --> 1:25:08.125
- What, now?
- Right now, yes. Go.

1:25:08.125 --> 1:25:10.041
- I have a second request.
- Anything.

1:25:10.041 --> 1:25:13.041
Please give me a proper
and thorough burial.

1:25:13.833 --> 1:25:19.291
I don't want the animals eating me
for dinner. That would be ironic.

1:25:22.625 --> 1:25:24.208
- No.
- No.

1:25:24.208 --> 1:25:25.875
No!

1:25:26.375 --> 1:25:29.291
- Well done.

1:25:29.291 --> 1:25:34.333
Catherine, are you really in cahoots
with that hunchback?

1:25:34.333 --> 1:25:36.375
Don't be so naïve, Guy.

1:25:36.375 --> 1:25:39.541
Not only are they in "cahoosion,"
but she's clearly shagging the man.

1:25:40.333 --> 1:25:41.750
That's <i>impossible</i>.

1:25:41.750 --> 1:25:44.125
Oh, it's very <i>possible</i>.

1:25:44.125 --> 1:25:48.666
- Oh! Hit that shit, Quasi. Hit that shit.
Yeah, right. Really?

1:25:48.666 --> 1:25:51.166
No, sire, it's <i>impossible</i>.

1:25:51.166 --> 1:25:54.666
Guards, take the hunchback's head.

1:25:57.333 --> 1:26:00.208
And use your dullest blade.

1:26:04.500 --> 1:26:11.125
Such is the fate of the mangled,
lonely weirdo. Eh, Hunchback?

1:26:11.125 --> 1:26:14.208
<i>Un. Deux.</i>

1:26:16.458 --> 1:26:18.041
-<i>Trois!</i>

1:26:18.041 --> 1:26:19.333
Stop!

1:26:20.750 --> 1:26:22.791
- He is royalty.
- What?

1:26:22.791 --> 1:26:23.958
Fuck no!

1:26:23.958 --> 1:26:27.083
The hunchback is
a member of the royal family.

1:26:27.083 --> 1:26:31.041
He who lays a hand on him
shall pay the ultimate price.

1:26:31.041 --> 1:26:32.875
Nonsense.

1:26:33.583 --> 1:26:35.791
He bears the mark of the Gastineau.

1:26:37.916 --> 1:26:39.833
- Oh, look.
- Oh, but look at that. Yeah.

1:26:39.833 --> 1:26:44.958
It can't be.
It must be dirt or a wine stain.

1:26:44.958 --> 1:26:48.333
Are you sure it's not jelly?
Sometimes I get jelly on my shoulder.

1:26:48.333 --> 1:26:52.250
Oh, he is of royal blood.

1:26:54.125 --> 1:26:56.166
Oh, stand up and kill him anyway.

1:26:56.166 --> 1:26:57.875
Wait, sire.

1:26:59.250 --> 1:27:03.333
Is this how you treat a loyal subject who,
on your orders,

1:27:03.333 --> 1:27:05.000
tried to assassinate the pope?

1:27:06.625 --> 1:27:07.833
I'm sorry, what's that now?

1:27:07.833 --> 1:27:11.958
The king asked me to kill you,
oh, Holy One.

1:27:11.958 --> 1:27:13.875
Guards, put his head on the stump.

1:27:13.875 --> 1:27:15.458
Guards, hold.

1:27:16.375 --> 1:27:22.166
Hunchback, are you saying
that the king ordered you to kill me?

1:27:22.166 --> 1:27:24.125
- He did, Your Grace.

1:27:24.125 --> 1:27:27.750
Just before you commanded me
to assassinate him.

1:27:28.791 --> 1:27:30.833
- You did what?

1:27:30.833 --> 1:27:33.416
That's enough. Papal guard, shoot his man.

1:27:33.416 --> 1:27:34.708
What?

1:27:36.583 --> 1:27:38.666
You just killed my man.

1:27:38.666 --> 1:27:40.041
Oh, shit.

1:27:40.041 --> 1:27:41.666
Guards, shoot his man.

1:27:43.750 --> 1:27:46.583
Fuck you, Your Grace.

1:27:49.500 --> 1:27:53.791
Is this what you want?
Surely, you want more from a leader.

1:27:53.791 --> 1:27:55.083
We're not sure!

1:27:55.083 --> 1:27:56.458
And we know no other way!

1:27:56.458 --> 1:27:57.833
There is another way.

1:27:57.833 --> 1:28:01.750
I was once like you.
I thought I didn't matter.

1:28:01.750 --> 1:28:05.958
But I've learned,
with the help of my friends...

1:28:08.000 --> 1:28:09.083
that I do.

1:28:09.083 --> 1:28:10.708
So do you.

1:28:10.708 --> 1:28:11.833
He's kinda right.

1:28:12.750 --> 1:28:19.708
If this sad, lonely hunchback
can sit at a table with the king

1:28:19.708 --> 1:28:24.166
and dine on oysters, you can, too.

1:28:24.166 --> 1:28:25.208
Oysters!

1:28:25.208 --> 1:28:28.416
We can all eat oysters!

1:28:28.416 --> 1:28:30.958
Oysters! Oysters!
Oysters! Oysters!

1:28:30.958 --> 1:28:35.958
Oysters! Oysters!
Oysters! Oysters! Oysters!

1:28:35.958 --> 1:28:39.166
So this is that oyster chant
I've been hearing about.

1:28:39.166 --> 1:28:40.625
What a catchy little ditty.

1:28:40.625 --> 1:28:44.333
Oysters! Oysters!
Oysters! Oysters! Oysters!

1:28:44.333 --> 1:28:46.041
Enough!

1:28:46.041 --> 1:28:49.958
The next person to say "oysters"
will be disemboweled.

1:28:51.083 --> 1:28:52.291
Oysters.

1:28:52.291 --> 1:28:54.166
I want to say it was
that fellow in the green--

1:28:54.166 --> 1:28:57.041
Oh! Who threw that?

1:28:57.041 --> 1:28:59.125
What, what? Oh!

1:28:59.125 --> 1:29:00.583
Oh!

1:29:01.625 --> 1:29:04.041
- As your king, I command you to stop.

1:29:04.041 --> 1:29:05.416
Ow! Kettle in the stomach!

1:29:05.416 --> 1:29:08.375
Eat shit, Guy! Quasi gets us!

1:29:08.375 --> 1:29:10.375
Get control of your people.

1:29:10.375 --> 1:29:12.625
How dare you come into my country and--

1:29:12.625 --> 1:29:15.833
You know what? I've had just about enough
of you and your country.

1:29:22.541 --> 1:29:27.958
You can't stab me. I'm the king.

1:29:27.958 --> 1:29:30.041
Well, now, you're a king on a stick.

1:29:32.541 --> 1:29:34.625
We all saw
that he was asking for it, right?

1:29:34.625 --> 1:29:35.875
- I mean--

1:29:38.458 --> 1:29:41.125
Goddamn it, I'm the pope.

1:29:41.708 --> 1:29:43.875
Good luck finding a cool breeze in hell.

1:29:45.375 --> 1:29:50.208
None of this would have happened if
you weren't so jealous of my new alliance,

1:29:50.208 --> 1:29:51.291
you prick.

1:29:51.291 --> 1:29:52.625
You're the prick.

1:29:53.125 --> 1:29:55.750
You were a prick when we dated,
and you're still a prick now.

1:29:55.750 --> 1:29:56.791
- What?

1:29:56.791 --> 1:29:58.291
Oh, poop!

1:29:58.958 --> 1:30:00.625
I'm the prick?

1:30:00.625 --> 1:30:04.458
You're the one who cheated on me
at <i>université</i> with Jacques Chouinard.

1:30:04.458 --> 1:30:08.875
What? You cheated on me
at <i>université</i> with Jacques Chouinard.

1:30:08.875 --> 1:30:10.083
What's happening?

1:30:10.083 --> 1:30:15.166
- Who told you that? I loved you.

1:30:17.500 --> 1:30:20.208
And I... loved you.

1:30:23.000 --> 1:30:27.083
I still love you.

1:30:27.083 --> 1:30:30.958
And I, you.

1:30:40.375 --> 1:30:43.791
Whoa. That plot thickened a lot.

1:30:44.750 --> 1:30:45.916
Du.

1:30:45.916 --> 1:30:47.791
- Du!

1:30:47.791 --> 1:30:48.875
How you doing, Du?

1:30:48.875 --> 1:30:51.750
Amateurs. They nailed me

1:30:51.750 --> 1:30:53.833
- through the skin of the sack.
- So stupid.

1:30:53.833 --> 1:30:56.041
A professional would have gone
right through the testicle.

1:30:56.041 --> 1:30:58.208
Huh, I remember my first scrotum nailing.

1:30:58.208 --> 1:30:59.666
In fact...
Yeah.

1:30:59.666 --> 1:31:00.833
...you were there, my old friend.

1:31:00.833 --> 1:31:03.166
- I was, my old friend.
- Yeah.

1:31:03.166 --> 1:31:05.208
- My old friend.
- Yeah. Yeah.

1:31:05.208 --> 1:31:06.875
And I'm not just saying that
'cause of Michel.

1:31:06.875 --> 1:31:09.125
- Ah.
- There is no Jerome.

1:31:09.916 --> 1:31:11.666
You are my best friend.

1:31:12.250 --> 1:31:13.458
And you mine.

1:31:14.041 --> 1:31:18.000
I've never even been to Champagne.
I hear it's lovely.

1:31:19.333 --> 1:31:22.791
Duchamp, we will go to Champagne together.

1:31:23.416 --> 1:31:27.458
And we will drink much, much wine.

1:31:27.458 --> 1:31:29.416
Aw.

1:31:31.875 --> 1:31:36.083
Subjects of France,
kneel before your new king.

1:31:36.083 --> 1:31:38.541
Yeah! King Quasi!

1:31:40.458 --> 1:31:43.916
Come, Quasi. Your kingdom awaits you.

1:31:43.916 --> 1:31:46.000
Go, go, my friend.

1:31:46.000 --> 1:31:48.125
We're not kneeling
because of the birthmark.

1:31:48.125 --> 1:31:49.750
We like what he has to say.

1:31:51.291 --> 1:31:52.791
King Quasi!

1:32:06.208 --> 1:32:07.541
Yeah!

1:32:09.458 --> 1:32:13.500
<i>And so it was,
a new king was crowned.</i>

1:32:13.500 --> 1:32:17.708
<i>A king unlike any France had ever known.</i>

1:32:18.416 --> 1:32:19.833
<i>And the country flourished,</i>

1:32:20.833 --> 1:32:25.916
<i>for it was ruled by a king and queen
who valued merit, virtue,</i>

1:32:25.916 --> 1:32:27.500
<i>and decency.</i>

1:32:29.083 --> 1:32:32.250
<i>A king and queen of the people.</i>

1:32:33.791 --> 1:32:35.125
- You like oysters?
- Of course.

1:32:35.125 --> 1:32:37.250
Right, who doesn't?

1:32:40.125 --> 1:32:42.416
Hey. Hey.

1:32:42.416 --> 1:32:43.708
- Yeah?
- Clean.

1:32:43.708 --> 1:32:44.875
- Oh.
- Yeah.

1:32:44.875 --> 1:32:46.416
- You got it.

1:32:46.416 --> 1:32:48.208
- Down the hatch.
- Mm-hmm.

1:32:49.416 --> 1:32:52.083
Mmm. Mmm. Mmm! Oh.

1:32:53.208 --> 1:32:55.125
- Food of kings.
- Yeah, yeah. And queens.

1:32:55.125 --> 1:32:56.625
- Oh!
- Oh.

1:32:57.875 --> 1:32:58.958
Hold on a second.

1:32:59.583 --> 1:33:02.291
- Oysters! Oysters!
- Oysters!

1:33:02.291 --> 1:33:08.125
Oysters! Oysters! Oysters!
Oysters! Oysters! Oysters! Oysters!

1:33:08.125 --> 1:33:11.000
Oysters! Oysters! Oysters! Oysters!

1:33:11.000 --> 1:33:14.291
<i>And their reign lasted many years,</i>

1:33:14.291 --> 1:33:20.291
<i>and they conquered many foes
and ate many oysters.</i>

1:33:21.041 --> 1:33:24.208
<i>But that is a different story.</i>

1:34:32.083 --> 1:34:33.833
Look at how these guys do it.
See how they do it?

1:34:33.833 --> 1:34:35.625
- Here, do you wanna go?
- Oh, no, go. You're good.

1:34:35.625 --> 1:34:37.000
- Okay.
- You're doing a great job.

1:34:37.000 --> 1:34:43.166
May our dear friend, Michel Domeck,
forever rest in peace and find happiness.

1:34:43.166 --> 1:34:45.541
Quasi, I think we need a bigger hole.

1:34:45.541 --> 1:34:47.166
Oh, shit. Um...

1:34:48.166 --> 1:34:49.750
Oh. Oops.

1:34:49.750 --> 1:34:51.000
Good?

1:34:51.541 --> 1:34:52.791
Okay.

1:34:52.791 --> 1:34:54.208
Okay, well...

1:34:55.041 --> 1:34:56.041
We didn't quite get it.

1:34:56.041 --> 1:34:57.500
Yeah, we're not good at this.

1:34:57.500 --> 1:34:58.541
Not enough dirt.

1:34:58.541 --> 1:35:00.125
- We got close, huh?
- Yeah, we did.

1:35:55.666 --> 1:35:58.291
Action.
- Oh, can you bring a hollandaise sauce

1:35:58.291 --> 1:35:59.375
for the hog anus?

1:35:59.375 --> 1:36:01.666
Béarnaise sauce for the hog anus?

1:36:01.666 --> 1:36:05.666
Oh, could you bring an au jus
for the hog anus, please?

1:36:07.208 --> 1:36:08.583
All right, good?
- No.

1:36:08.583 --> 1:36:12.541
Oh, could you bring some orange marmalade
for the hog anus, please?

1:36:12.541 --> 1:36:16.458
Oh, could you bring some Cool Ranch
Doritos for the hog anus, please?

1:36:17.250 --> 1:36:18.750
Okay, now I'm done.

1:36:20.166 --> 1:36:21.500
They know you're alive.

1:36:22.083 --> 1:36:25.375
If I go with you,
they'll undoubtedly find me...

1:36:25.375 --> 1:36:26.833
...find us and kill us both.

1:36:26.833 --> 1:36:29.583
The king killed his last wife.
- I still have another line.

1:36:29.583 --> 1:36:30.666
Oh, sorry.

1:36:31.333 --> 1:36:32.875
I find the horse very distracting.

1:36:33.500 --> 1:36:35.083
He will go without you.

1:36:35.083 --> 1:36:37.000
Now, here is some money.

1:36:37.583 --> 1:36:40.666
But a word of caution.
Do not pay the ferryman--

1:36:40.666 --> 1:36:43.375
Hold on a second.

1:36:43.375 --> 1:36:45.250
I promise not to hit your nuts.

1:36:47.791 --> 1:36:49.375
I'm not aiming for them.

1:36:53.083 --> 1:36:55.708
I'll give him one for the torture chamber.

1:36:55.708 --> 1:36:57.416
- Oh, fuck.

1:36:57.416 --> 1:36:59.166
This is my second day. I...

1:36:59.666 --> 1:37:02.291
It's not your second day.
I saw you in a previous scene.

1:37:02.291 --> 1:37:04.708
- Cut. Fire him.

1:37:04.708 --> 1:37:07.250
Oh, oh.

1:37:08.333 --> 1:37:10.500
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.
Cramp, cramp, cramp. Shit.

1:37:10.500 --> 1:37:12.833
Jerome's cool, and his face is straight.

1:37:12.833 --> 1:37:14.250
Is that-- Oh, really?

1:37:14.250 --> 1:37:15.375
Yeah, mm-hmm.

1:37:15.375 --> 1:37:16.958
Okay.

1:37:19.500 --> 1:37:21.083
A friend with a straight face?

1:37:21.083 --> 1:37:22.833
- Come on. You don't have many of those.
- Yeah.

1:37:22.833 --> 1:37:24.583
- I'll tell you that.
- Yeah, no-- No shit.

1:37:27.500 --> 1:37:31.541
I can't help but notice all these
important looks you're throwing at him.

1:37:32.208 --> 1:37:33.958
What the fuck is going on over here?

1:37:33.958 --> 1:37:36.958
He'll be even more insufferable.

1:37:36.958 --> 1:37:39.125
Stick with it.
- Okay, I can't look at him.

1:37:39.125 --> 1:37:40.458
Hey, shitbrain.

1:37:40.458 --> 1:37:42.083
Hey, shampoo model.

1:37:42.083 --> 1:37:43.666
Hey, muscular old lady.

1:37:43.666 --> 1:37:45.291
Oh, it's Pascal.

1:37:45.291 --> 1:37:48.750
And I, m-mine.

1:37:49.250 --> 1:37:51.833
Oh. Oh, my.

1:37:51.833 --> 1:37:55.083
<i>♪ Ding dang dong
Ding dang dong ♪</i>

1:37:55.083 --> 1:37:56.166
Cut!
