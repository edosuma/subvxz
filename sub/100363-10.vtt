this is a magic‐proof cell,
so...

10:24.224 --> 10:27.293
the hedge‐witch‐explosive
arts and crafts

10:27.327 --> 10:28.962
are at best
wishful thinking.

10:28.995 --> 10:32.198
‐ And you didn't think
to tell me that 45 minutes ago?

10:32.232 --> 10:34.868
‐ It seemed like
you needed an activity.

10:34.901 --> 10:36.936
I'm honestly trying to help.

10:36.970 --> 10:37.837
It's bad enough for me,

10:37.871 --> 10:39.772
and I don't even have
a human inside me.

10:39.806 --> 10:42.709
‐ Except you do, technically.

10:42.742 --> 10:44.043
‐ Shit.

10:44.077 --> 10:46.045
Now there's nothing to do.

10:46.079 --> 10:49.082
‐ I really let it go on
as long as I felt morally able.

10:49.115 --> 10:51.117
‐ What are we going
to do, Eliot?

10:51.151 --> 10:53.720
‐ We'll think of something?

10:53.753 --> 10:54.888
‐ Is that a question?

10:54.921 --> 10:58.224
‐ I am trying my best
to calm you down‐‐

10:58.258 --> 10:59.292
‐ Calm me down?

10:59.325 --> 11:00.760
What am I,
a maiden with the vapors?

11:00.793 --> 11:02.629
‐ You're upset‐‐
‐ [yelling] I'm not upset.

11:02.662 --> 11:05.832
I'm locked in a dungeon during
Red fucking Monkey month

11:05.865 --> 11:08.801
with this baby growing
inside me like a weed on HGH,

11:08.835 --> 11:11.237
on a planet without so much
as a fucking prenatal vitamin.

11:11.271 --> 11:13.139
But no, I'm not upset.
I don't get upset.

11:13.173 --> 11:14.140
I figure it out.

11:14.174 --> 11:16.376
[inhales and exhales]

11:16.409 --> 11:18.244
There is always something.

11:18.278 --> 11:20.747
‐ Is there?
‐ Of course there is.

11:20.780 --> 11:22.949
I agree.
‐ Do you?

11:22.982 --> 11:24.884
Do you actually believe that?

11:24.918 --> 11:26.619
‐ [exhales]
‐ Um...

11:26.653 --> 11:28.154
‐ I can't believe
I thought I could fix this.

11:28.188 --> 11:31.324
I'm the reason we're here
in the first place.

11:31.357 --> 11:33.960
‐ Hey.
‐ No.

11:33.993 --> 11:37.130
‐ I wouldn't say that‐‐
‐ Face it, I failed, Eliot.

11:37.163 --> 11:38.731
‐ [sighs]

11:38.765 --> 11:40.767
You didn't fail,
you're just tired.

11:40.800 --> 11:41.568
You're cooped up‐‐

11:41.601 --> 11:42.802
‐ I stole a quest,
I got it wrong.

11:42.835 --> 11:45.872
I screwed magic on Earth,
I screwed us here.

11:45.905 --> 11:47.340
And the thing about it is,
you know,

11:47.373 --> 11:49.209
facing ever increasing bad odds

11:49.242 --> 11:50.443
is that you have to be
really good

11:50.476 --> 11:52.845
at thinking
of the next thing to try.

11:52.879 --> 11:55.982
‐ Hey, let's just
take a deep breath, okay?

11:56.015 --> 11:57.050
We'll just‐‐

11:57.083 --> 11:58.284
‐ I mean,
there is nothing else.

11:58.318 --> 11:59.953
We are done.

11:59.986 --> 12:02.155
‐ [softly] No.
‐ We're gonna die here.

12:02.188 --> 12:04.290
My baby is going to die here.
We are gonna die.

12:04.324 --> 12:06.826
And it all went to shit.
‐ Hey, hey, hey.

12:06.859 --> 12:08.194
You're just,
you're having a moment‐‐

12:08.228 --> 12:10.196
‐ This is not a moment.
It's my life.

12:10.230 --> 12:11.864
‐ You need to calm her.

12:11.898 --> 12:13.399
She's gonna give
the baby bad humors.

12:13.433 --> 12:16.836
‐ I just heard a voice
say bad humors?

12:16.869 --> 12:18.471
‐ You heard that?
‐ You heard me?

12:18.504 --> 12:21.007
Can you still hear me?
This is wonderful.

12:21.040 --> 12:22.375
‐ Yeah.
‐ My name is Charlton.

12:22.408 --> 12:24.177
‐ What the fuck's a Charlton?

12:28.581 --> 12:29.515
‐ So there's a man inside
your head and I heard him?

12:31.918 --> 12:35.388
‐ That's it, more or less.
‐ An excellent summation.

12:35.421 --> 12:37.323
‐ Why all of a sudden
could I hear him?

12:37.357 --> 12:38.391
And then why did it stop?

12:38.424 --> 12:40.693
‐ I don't know.

12:40.727 --> 12:42.362
‐ Well...

12:42.395 --> 12:45.198
Her weird baby is developing.

12:45.231 --> 12:47.000
My mother, who was a midwife,

12:47.033 --> 12:49.202
once tended a lady
pregnant by a nixie.

12:49.235 --> 12:51.004
She often sleepwalked

12:51.037 --> 12:52.739
into the sea,
but no ill befell her,

12:52.772 --> 12:55.508
because she developed
gestational gills.

12:55.541 --> 12:58.745
‐ Charlton theorizes that
you had a psychic attack

12:58.778 --> 13:00.013
because of, well,

13:00.046 --> 13:02.682
who and what the baby daddy is.

13:02.715 --> 13:04.284
‐ Wait, so you're saying
that's a thing?

13:04.317 --> 13:07.186
Me being able to take on
what the baby can do?

13:07.220 --> 13:08.421
‐ Maybe.

13:10.290 --> 13:12.358
‐ Well, maybe this baby
is a traveler.

13:12.392 --> 13:14.761
I mean that'd be pretty goddamn
handy right about now, no?

13:14.794 --> 13:15.662
‐ Mm‐hmm.

13:15.695 --> 13:17.897
‐ Okay, we need
to quantify this shit.

13:17.930 --> 13:19.399
What's happening,
how can I control it,

13:19.432 --> 13:21.334
keep baby safe, and get us
the hell out of here.

13:21.367 --> 13:24.470
‐ I studied this.
First year.

13:24.504 --> 13:26.239
They make us take sex ed,

13:26.272 --> 13:31.244
inter‐magician relations being
so fraught with STIs and peril.

13:31.277 --> 13:33.279
I think we may have
covered this stuff.

13:33.313 --> 13:34.814
‐ You think, or‐‐

13:34.847 --> 13:37.450
‐ I'm not proud,
but I was on a...

13:37.483 --> 13:39.485
record amount
of greenhouse cannabis.

13:39.519 --> 13:42.221
And so while technically
I heard every single word,

13:42.255 --> 13:45.224
it was all, you know,
Sondheim lyrics.

13:45.258 --> 13:47.927
I was there,
but in a greater sense,

13:47.960 --> 13:50.330
was I there?

13:50.363 --> 13:52.765
‐ Well, perhaps I can help.

13:52.799 --> 13:54.934
If you were,
as you say, there,

13:54.967 --> 13:56.436
perhaps the remembrance
itself is‐‐

13:56.469 --> 13:58.971
‐ Is intact in here still
somehow, that is brilliant.

13:59.005 --> 13:59.806
Can you go‐‐
‐ Yeah, I can

13:59.839 --> 14:01.107
certainly attempt.

14:01.140 --> 14:03.443
‐ My imaginary friend is on it.

14:03.476 --> 14:05.578
‐ Great.

14:07.180 --> 14:08.448
‐ "Dos and don'ts

14:08.481 --> 14:10.450
of magical intercourse."

14:10.483 --> 14:12.251
‐ I avoided real college

14:12.285 --> 14:14.020
so I wouldn't have
to see shit like this.

14:14.053 --> 14:17.123
‐ You kidding?
This is spank bank material.

14:17.156 --> 14:20.293
‐ If it burns when you pee,

14:20.326 --> 14:22.028
infirmary.

14:22.061 --> 14:24.430
Red bumps like a curse,

14:24.464 --> 14:26.132
see a nurse.

14:26.165 --> 14:28.234
Scales, feathers, furs‐‐

14:28.267 --> 14:30.203
‐ Medical attention
that rhymes with fur,

14:30.236 --> 14:31.204
read you loud and clear.

14:31.237 --> 14:34.273
‐ Now, let's chat
procreation, shall we?

14:34.307 --> 14:36.109
Let's start with some basics.

14:36.142 --> 14:38.144
[chalkboard squeaks]
Do not assume

14:38.177 --> 14:39.946
that your classmate is human

14:39.979 --> 14:43.383
just because they look it.
Hybrids abound.

14:43.416 --> 14:46.152
DNA magic develops in utero

14:46.185 --> 14:48.321
which can affect
the mother unpredictably,

14:48.354 --> 14:50.523
which can, of course,
result in maiming

14:50.556 --> 14:52.325
or death.

14:52.358 --> 14:53.659
If you think you've
been impregnated

14:53.693 --> 14:56.396
by a hybrid or creature,

14:56.429 --> 14:58.231
you may want
to take precautions

14:58.264 --> 15:01.033
to prevent any episodes.

15:01.067 --> 15:02.969
Let's go over a few, shall we?

15:03.002 --> 15:05.138
‐ Excuse me, wait,
I have questions.

15:05.171 --> 15:07.140
‐ Who are you?

15:07.173 --> 15:09.008
You are not a student here.

15:09.041 --> 15:10.843
‐ Of course I am.

15:10.877 --> 15:13.546
I did a thing to my face.
Hello, it's...

15:13.579 --> 15:14.981
Todd.

15:15.014 --> 15:17.150
‐ Todd.

15:17.183 --> 15:19.018
Yes, what's your question?

15:19.051 --> 15:21.320
‐ What if a person
wanted the episodes?

15:21.354 --> 15:26.058
Let's say the fetus was
psychic, or even a traveler.

15:26.092 --> 15:27.527
‐ I cannot speak to that.

15:27.560 --> 15:29.262
‐ Well, but you are
speaking to that.

15:29.295 --> 15:31.130
‐ This is a memory.

15:31.164 --> 15:33.099
I made no mention
of travelers specifically.

15:33.132 --> 15:37.003
‐ Okay, but say
I wanted my baby to‐‐

15:37.036 --> 15:39.038
‐ I can only tell you what's
happening in this memory,

15:39.071 --> 15:41.340
Todd.
And how to prevent it.

15:41.374 --> 15:43.376
‐ But that won't help me.
You see, I need to know‐‐

15:43.409 --> 15:45.077
‐ Hey, genius.

15:45.111 --> 15:47.180
Why don't you just let him
tell you how to stop it

15:47.213 --> 15:49.916
and do the opposite?

15:51.350 --> 15:52.618
‐ It's a defense mechanism.

15:52.652 --> 15:54.287
The fetus detects
the mother's distress

15:54.320 --> 15:56.222
and reacts protectively.

15:56.255 --> 15:58.424
‐ You freaked the baby out
with your meltdown,

15:58.458 --> 16:00.226
so it psyched you up.

16:00.259 --> 16:01.427
Next?

16:01.461 --> 16:03.496
‐ And this can be avoided
by cultivating a tranquil mind.

16:03.529 --> 16:05.231
Soothing teas, meditation‐‐

16:05.264 --> 16:07.467
‐ Can we just skip to the part
where Julia travels to safety?

16:07.500 --> 16:09.202
‐ Oh, right,
then she'll need to

16:09.235 --> 16:11.137
aggressively do the opposite.

16:11.170 --> 16:12.538
‐ The opposite
of tea and meditation?

16:12.572 --> 16:14.941
‐ Wait, is he saying
I need to freak out more?

16:14.974 --> 16:17.310
‐ She needs to feel imminent
life or death danger, yes.

16:17.343 --> 16:19.245
‐ [sighs]

16:19.278 --> 16:20.713
Basically.

16:20.746 --> 16:22.615
We need to scare
the living shit out of you.

16:22.648 --> 16:24.617
‐ Great.

16:24.650 --> 16:26.319
‐ This is fine.
Totally fine.

16:26.352 --> 16:28.221
[Taker growling]
Just a totally normal walk

16:28.254 --> 16:29.589
through a totally
normal forest.

16:29.622 --> 16:32.692
‐ [shrieking]

16:38.564 --> 16:41.400
‐ You can't hear that,
but that is a Taker

16:41.434 --> 16:43.569
screaming for some reason.

16:43.603 --> 16:45.471
‐ Whose eye is that?
‐ [screams]

16:45.505 --> 16:48.107
Nobody's.
It's...

16:48.140 --> 16:50.309
My girlfriend's eye.

16:50.343 --> 16:52.411
‐ That's not better, you know?

16:52.445 --> 16:54.480
‐ She lent it to me.

16:54.514 --> 16:56.249
Where did you come from?

16:58.317 --> 17:00.119
How about that?
So did I.

17:00.152 --> 17:01.420
So how did you end up
down here?

17:01.454 --> 17:03.789
‐ I was taken
with my friends.

17:03.823 --> 17:06.125
‐ Friends.
Friends are good.

17:06.158 --> 17:07.126
Uh, where are they?

17:07.159 --> 17:11.364
‐ The Takers put them
in a big, shiny cave.

17:11.397 --> 17:12.999
It opens sideways.

17:13.032 --> 17:15.468
And when you poke
its big, yellow eye,

17:15.501 --> 17:19.138
its mouth opens
and says "ding."

17:19.171 --> 17:20.640
‐ That sounds like an elevator.

17:20.673 --> 17:22.108
‐ Is that a kind of monster?

17:22.141 --> 17:24.176
‐ No, not a monster.
A machine.

17:24.210 --> 17:25.344
‐ That eats people?

17:25.378 --> 17:28.314
‐ No, it goes up,
it goes down.

17:28.347 --> 17:31.117
It's just weird that it's here.

17:31.150 --> 17:32.518
Maybe we should check it out.
Do you know where‐‐

17:32.552 --> 17:34.554
‐ Are you an adult?
‐ Of course.

17:34.587 --> 17:37.156
Do I not seem like an adult?

17:37.189 --> 17:39.492
‐ Adults lie and say
everything's okay

17:39.525 --> 17:40.660
when it really isn't.

17:40.693 --> 17:42.361
‐ [sighs]
‐ Then Takers come.

17:42.395 --> 17:43.996
I'm not helping an adult.

17:44.030 --> 17:46.132
‐ Oh, please.
No.

17:46.165 --> 17:48.801
[groans]
God, just wait!

17:48.834 --> 17:50.503
‐ [shrieking]
‐ No, wait! No!

17:50.536 --> 17:52.338
No, don't touch.
Let me go.

17:52.371 --> 17:53.673
No, let me go.
‐ Hey.

17:53.706 --> 17:56.175
‐ [screaming] No, no, no!
‐ Hey.

17:56.208 --> 17:57.743
Uh, you like this?

17:57.777 --> 17:59.745
Yeah, shiny, right?

17:59.779 --> 18:01.547
Yeah, good.
Go get it.

18:04.283 --> 18:05.851
‐ [panting]
‐ Hey, hey, hey, you okay?

18:05.885 --> 18:07.520
‐ Yeah.
How did you do that?

18:07.553 --> 18:09.722
‐ Luck.
Let's get the hell out of here.

18:11.557 --> 18:13.659
That'll do it.

18:13.693 --> 18:16.696
My own personal Mar‐Go‐Pro.

18:16.729 --> 18:18.531
Trust me, where I'm from,
that was really clever.

18:18.564 --> 18:20.066
‐ Well, here it's stupid, okay?

18:20.099 --> 18:23.369
Now here's the cave over there,
okay?

18:23.402 --> 18:25.271
‐ Okay.
Looks clear.

18:25.304 --> 18:27.673
Let's get a little closer
and see where it goes.

18:27.707 --> 18:30.209
Come on.
Shh.

18:33.613 --> 18:35.514
[ding]

18:38.250 --> 18:40.720
Underworld?
‐ Do we not want to go there?

18:42.588 --> 18:44.123
‐ Uh...

18:44.156 --> 18:46.525
‐ [snarling]

18:48.194 --> 18:49.695
‐ Underworld sounds
pretty good right now.

18:49.729 --> 18:51.130
‐ [growling]

18:51.163 --> 18:53.065
‐ Come on.
Come on!

18:53.099 --> 18:55.434
‐ [snarling]

18:55.468 --> 18:57.403
‐ Oh!

18:57.436 --> 18:59.205
Not today, Takers.

18:59.238 --> 19:00.406
‐ [sighs]

19:00.439 --> 19:03.476
But where are we going?

19:03.509 --> 19:06.212

40:32.964 --> 40:36.567
‐ Oh, my God.
They're all dead.

40:36.601 --> 40:40.939
‐ Is that a good thing?

40:40.972 --> 40:42.540
‐ I don't know.

40:46.878 --> 40:49.914
[whirring, clanging softly]

40:52.150 --> 40:53.785
‐ Okay, we should stop.

40:53.818 --> 40:54.786
‐ [tiredly] It's okay.

40:54.819 --> 40:56.621
I can do this.

40:57.789 --> 41:00.325
[snores]
‐ Okay. All right, come here.

41:03.995 --> 41:06.597
He said this was
eradicating your‐‐

41:06.631 --> 41:09.033
‐ Timey wimey plasma factor.

41:09.067 --> 41:11.636
‐ Why does it look like
this is collecting it?

41:11.669 --> 41:14.639
‐ What?
Let me see that.

41:14.672 --> 41:15.974
‐ Your hand is shaking.

41:16.007 --> 41:17.475
‐ [groans]

41:17.508 --> 41:19.644
I don't want this.
Get this thing off.

41:19.677 --> 41:20.979
‐ [grunts]

41:21.012 --> 41:23.448
‐ What the hell is it now?
Step away from her.

41:23.481 --> 41:26.551
‐ This is how you
unburden her curse?

41:26.584 --> 41:28.152
By collecting it?

41:28.186 --> 41:30.488
‐ You don't understand
what you're talking about.

41:30.521 --> 41:31.656
Put that down.

41:31.689 --> 41:34.659
‐ How about I smash it?
‐ Wait.

41:34.692 --> 41:35.827
Stop.
Okay.

41:35.860 --> 41:39.163
‐ Your hand.
That tremor.

41:39.197 --> 41:40.732
That's what happens
when you run low?

41:40.765 --> 41:42.667
Your finite supply?

41:42.700 --> 41:44.969
‐ Do you ever stop
asking questions?

41:45.003 --> 41:48.039
‐ You're not a guardian
of space‐time.

41:48.072 --> 41:49.674
You're a junkie.

41:49.707 --> 41:50.541
‐ I wasn't lying‐‐

41:50.575 --> 41:53.177
‐ You used the signal
to find us

41:53.211 --> 41:55.713
so you can take what we have
to use for yourself.

41:55.747 --> 41:58.416
‐ I wasn't lying
about what I do.

41:58.449 --> 42:00.518
Time travelers are so rare.

42:00.551 --> 42:03.154
But you spend your life
chasing them to unflap

42:03.187 --> 42:06.491
every butterfly wing, it feels
like they're everywhere.

42:06.524 --> 42:08.593
I'm just trying to stop idiots

42:08.626 --> 42:10.862
from destroying
the entire universe.

42:10.895 --> 42:12.864
‐ Oh, it's interesting
that idiots

42:12.897 --> 42:14.732
include everyone except you.

42:14.766 --> 42:16.901
‐ Tell me most people
can be trusted.

42:16.934 --> 42:19.904
Tell me more power
makes people better.

42:19.937 --> 42:22.573
No?
I thought so.

42:25.576 --> 42:28.746
I have been keeping
this whole thing together,

42:28.780 --> 42:30.648
by myself, forever.

42:30.681 --> 42:33.084
‐ You didn't think
you could ask me for help?

42:33.117 --> 42:34.585
‐ Oh, I tried a few times

42:34.619 --> 42:37.455
with a few of you
when I was your age.

42:37.488 --> 42:39.390
I believed in people.

42:39.424 --> 42:41.125
‐ You mean back before
you thought you were better

42:41.159 --> 42:42.960
than everyone else?

42:42.994 --> 42:45.763
‐ You can't understand
unless you've seen what I have.

42:45.797 --> 42:47.732
And I wouldn't wish that
on the devil.

42:47.765 --> 42:50.068
It's why I put you here.

42:50.101 --> 42:52.603
One day, maybe you'll
know enough to thank me.

42:52.637 --> 42:54.472
‐ Okay, brass tacks.
We're leaving.

42:54.505 --> 42:56.574
‐ When she finishes‐‐
‐ I won't.

42:56.607 --> 42:57.575
‐ She's not finishing.

42:57.608 --> 43:00.545
She's walking away
with whatever's in her veins

43:00.578 --> 43:03.014
in exchange for this.

43:05.550 --> 43:08.619
‐ I can't let her go if she‐‐
‐ That's the deal.

43:12.790 --> 43:13.958
‐ Fine.

43:17.829 --> 43:19.564
Learn not to time travel.

43:19.597 --> 43:21.265
Because hear me.

43:21.299 --> 43:24.235
If you go back,
if you change a hair on a fly,

43:24.268 --> 43:27.105
you will be seeing me.

43:27.138 --> 43:30.141
And it will be the very
last time you see anyone.

43:32.543 --> 43:33.978
‐ Can't wait.

43:37.882 --> 43:39.550
Hey, help!

43:42.720 --> 43:44.655
‐ Okay, she's breathing.
She's coming to.

43:44.689 --> 43:46.557
‐ Oh.

43:48.826 --> 43:50.962
Yeah, uh,

43:50.995 --> 43:53.764
we should probably talk.
