02:02.033 --> 02:03.227
Moving on up.

02:03.793 --> 02:04.987
Believe that!

02:07.433 --> 02:09.185
Ladies, we got picture.

02:09.393 --> 02:10.223
What about the alarm?

02:10.433 --> 02:12.344
Miles, what do you think I'm doing?

02:12.553 --> 02:15.431
Just cool out. We like to run
a loose crew around here.

02:15.833 --> 02:16.982
You're the boss, Miles.

02:17.193 --> 02:18.342
It's like that?

02:18.553 --> 02:19.702
It's like that.

02:20.193 --> 02:22.787
I'm gonna go check on Tulley.

02:33.913 --> 02:36.347
Tulley, we cool down there?

02:38.113 --> 02:39.626
Yeah, we're cool, man.

02:39.913 --> 02:40.709
Good.

02:41.113 --> 02:42.512
Cool is good.

02:42.993 --> 02:43.982
Are you smoking?

02:44.433 --> 02:45.832
No. Negative.

02:46.193 --> 02:46.989
You're lying!

02:47.193 --> 02:49.184
I smell the menthol up here, man!

02:49.593 --> 02:52.949
What would your mama do
if she knew you were smoking?

02:53.153 --> 02:54.745
Cut it out, man!

02:57.473 --> 02:58.508
Stay alert.

02:59.433 --> 03:00.786
You ready over here?

03:06.233 --> 03:08.747
Damn it! Eddie, why you
gotta do that every time?

03:08.953 --> 03:09.749
It's good luck.

03:09.993 --> 03:12.746
It's bad luck if I land in it.
Believe that.

03:12.953 --> 03:14.511
Don't fall in that shit.

03:15.273 --> 03:16.069
See you, Deke.

03:16.833 --> 03:18.107
Good luck, guys.

03:49.433 --> 03:50.912
How's the weather up there?

03:51.113 --> 03:52.182
Snowing.

03:52.633 --> 03:55.545
It's beginning to look
a lot like Christmas.

04:24.033 --> 04:25.830
You got a guard 20 feet from you.

04:32.153 --> 04:33.666
Ten feet.
He's closing in fast.

04:34.913 --> 04:35.982
Around the corner.

05:14.953 --> 05:16.181
He turned around.

05:18.513 --> 05:19.582
Forget it. He's gone.

05:21.393 --> 05:23.463
So much for the easy part. Kit.

05:25.033 --> 05:27.183
-Shit!
-Bam!

05:27.433 --> 05:28.627
I hate it when you do that.

05:28.993 --> 05:30.187
Eddie, check this out.

05:30.393 --> 05:33.032
This is a Brigger 3300.
Toughest safe in the world.

05:33.313 --> 05:34.951
-What do you do?
-Drill the lock.

05:35.233 --> 05:37.542
No, you gotta check
to see if it's open.

05:38.393 --> 05:39.348
It's open!

05:40.313 --> 05:41.109
What?

05:41.713 --> 05:44.625
No, I'm messing with you.
They would never do that.

05:44.833 --> 05:46.585
They would never do that.

06:17.033 --> 06:18.068
Glasses.

06:23.593 --> 06:25.743
-I'll see you back up top.
-Right.

06:57.913 --> 06:59.312
Open sesame.

07:01.833 --> 07:02.822
Come on, Eddie.

07:03.633 --> 07:04.429
Got the rock?

07:04.633 --> 07:05.986
Miles is right behind me.

07:10.193 --> 07:11.387
What the hell you doing?

07:11.593 --> 07:13.549
Seventeen million four ways?

07:13.993 --> 07:15.472
I'm too greedy for that.

07:15.673 --> 07:16.708
No, just come on, man!

07:26.873 --> 07:27.669
Shit!

07:43.353 --> 07:45.105
Come here, gorgeous.

07:47.873 --> 07:50.023
Got the rock. Time to roll.

07:50.233 --> 07:51.461
Hurry! There's lots...

07:51.673 --> 07:53.345
...of activity here. Let's go!

07:53.553 --> 07:54.383
Shit!

08:21.673 --> 08:22.628
Freeze!

08:30.513 --> 08:31.343
Clear!

08:34.352 --> 08:35.467
Let's go!

08:35.673 --> 08:38.789
-Stay down! Don't move!
-Let me see your hands!

08:40.633 --> 08:42.429
-Where's Eddie?
-He went over already.

08:42.633 --> 08:43.782
-You have the rock?
-What?

08:43.993 --> 08:44.903
You got the rock?

08:45.193 --> 08:46.626
-What you doing?
-Give me the rock!

08:46.833 --> 08:48.551
You ain't got to do this!

08:48.753 --> 08:52.223
We're supposed to split this shit, man!
Why you doing this?

09:24.473 --> 09:25.349
Shit!

09:41.553 --> 09:43.589
Miles, you're dead,
you piece of shit!

10:47.593 --> 10:48.548
Damn!

11:19.753 --> 11:20.947
Good doggie!

11:21.233 --> 11:22.586
Good doggie!

11:22.793 --> 11:23.703
Kibbles 'n Bits!

11:23.913 --> 11:24.868
Easy.

11:25.433 --> 11:27.025
Where's the nearest exit?

11:27.713 --> 11:28.987
Stay where you are!

11:29.313 --> 11:30.223
Turn around!

11:30.473 --> 11:33.431
I'm a carpenter! I was working late!

11:34.753 --> 11:37.825
See? That's the saw!
See? I was working!

11:38.033 --> 11:40.627
You're under arrest.
You have the right to remain silent.

11:40.833 --> 11:43.631
Anything you say can and will
be used against you.

11:43.833 --> 11:47.348
If you can't afford an attorney,
one will be appointed for you.

11:47.553 --> 11:48.952
Do you understand your rights?

11:50.793 --> 11:52.749
Yeah, I understand them.

12:25.913 --> 12:27.505
Ain't nothing but a free thing, baby!

12:29.993 --> 12:31.790
Free man. Believe that.

12:32.793 --> 12:34.226
One belt, one shoelace...

12:34.433 --> 12:36.424
...one wallet containing $22.

12:36.713 --> 12:37.987
One shoelace?

12:38.313 --> 12:41.225
You know how much them shoes cost?
One shoelace?

12:41.433 --> 12:43.185
I came in here with two.

12:44.033 --> 12:46.866
You took my shoelace?
Did you take my shoelace, man?

12:47.713 --> 12:50.147
You got two seconds
to walk out that door.

12:50.393 --> 12:51.303
Sign out...

12:51.513 --> 12:53.071
...and leave my pen.

12:54.513 --> 12:55.707
I'm signing out.

12:56.033 --> 12:58.308
I got places to go, people to see.

12:58.593 --> 13:00.231
My lady, Janiece.

13:00.553 --> 13:01.747
Ass....

13:03.033 --> 13:04.182
It's like that.

13:04.393 --> 13:07.988
What you gonna do with one shoelace?
Let me in on the secret.

13:08.353 --> 13:09.991
Floss your ass?

13:10.633 --> 13:11.748
Gotta go.

13:14.873 --> 13:17.512
Y'all stay up, man.
Don't be mad because I gotta go.

13:17.793 --> 13:21.263
Come on, open this fence.
Thanks. I'm out of here.

13:23.233 --> 13:26.031
Where them butt-naked hoes at?
Do you know?

13:26.913 --> 13:28.312
Let me up out of here.

13:31.833 --> 13:34.301
I'm free! I'm free at last!

13:34.953 --> 13:35.749
Gotta go!

13:35.953 --> 13:37.306
Gotta go, gotta go!

13:39.393 --> 13:40.667
I'm out of here!

14:03.353 --> 14:04.547
Damn!

14:04.753 --> 14:06.311
What happened?

14:07.033 --> 14:09.069
Did you eat the whole time
I was in there?

14:09.273 --> 14:11.992
When I left, you was
like plickety-cow, plickety-pat.

14:12.353 --> 14:13.945
Now, you're like va-voom!

14:14.153 --> 14:17.145
Wait a minute. That's all right.
I can adjust.

14:17.353 --> 14:20.902
It's the love that counts.
I can adjust to a plus-size woman.

14:21.113 --> 14:23.946
Just more cushion for the pushin'!

14:24.433 --> 14:25.707
Janiece!

14:26.033 --> 14:28.467
Your sad-ass sack of bones is here.

14:29.233 --> 14:31.542
I apologize. You're her cousin!

14:32.153 --> 14:33.381
Can I buy you some cereal?

14:33.633 --> 14:34.952
It's okay, Shawna.

14:35.553 --> 14:38.750
There you are. Just hot!

14:41.633 --> 14:43.589
Baby, you are....

14:44.553 --> 14:45.827
You look beautiful.

14:46.233 --> 14:49.987
You are beautiful. And that's
not two years of prison talking.

14:50.193 --> 14:52.787
Baby, it must've been hard
in there for you.

14:53.033 --> 14:56.230
All alone at night in your little cot.

14:56.553 --> 14:58.066
Tell me something, Miles.

14:58.953 --> 15:00.511
Did you think about me?

15:01.633 --> 15:03.589
Think about you all the time.

15:03.913 --> 15:05.869
Think about you right now.

15:06.433 --> 15:09.823
Then you should've thought about that
before you robbed people!

15:11.633 --> 15:13.385
I never robbed you!

15:15.233 --> 15:16.985
I'm a rehabilitated man!

15:21.633 --> 15:22.782
Talk to me!

15:23.233 --> 15:26.031
I didn't come see you for two years.
Wasn't that a sign?

15:26.713 --> 15:28.749
You couldn't stand
to see your man like that.

15:29.113 --> 15:29.943
Man?

15:30.153 --> 15:33.987
You're not my man. You lie.
You told me you were a banker.

15:34.233 --> 15:36.701
Bank robber. Yeah, see,
sometime I stutter.

15:36.913 --> 15:39.791
But I'm getting that whole
speech impediment thing--

15:40.313 --> 15:44.829
You are a very smart man, but the entire
time we spent together was one big lie.

15:45.313 --> 15:47.781
Look, Janiece. Listen to me, okay?

15:48.313 --> 15:50.873
I know I lied about some things,
but I can change.

15:51.073 --> 15:52.142
I don't think so.

15:52.393 --> 15:53.189
Bye!

15:53.393 --> 15:55.827
Don't do me like this!

16:12.433 --> 16:14.185
Fifth and Grand?

16:29.233 --> 16:31.588
How you doing?
ls this really a police station?

16:31.833 --> 16:33.107
Of course.

17:11.553 --> 17:13.942
Hi. I have a delivery for Traffic.

17:15.032 --> 17:16.261
Sign by the "X."

17:18.633 --> 17:22.672
What have we got?
Egg roll, orange chicken....

17:23.073 --> 17:24.825
Hot pizza coming through. Hot pizza!

17:25.113 --> 17:27.069
Got to get the officers
their pizza.

17:27.313 --> 17:31.067
They got to protect and serve.
The police got to eat too!

17:31.313 --> 17:32.746
Let the officers eat, please.

17:32.993 --> 17:36.224
I'm the pizza man here
to deliver the pizza. Thank you.

17:36.433 --> 17:38.264
Officers, I got your pizzas!

17:39.833 --> 17:42.950
"Third Floor: Robbery-Homicide."

17:45.353 --> 17:47.628
Yeah, please be careful.
Pizza's very hot.

17:47.833 --> 17:51.382
Don't want nobody to get hurt.
Just got here some pizza for you.

17:51.593 --> 17:54.312
Pizza for you. That's how we do it
down at the pizza place.

17:54.913 --> 17:56.869
Watch it, watch it, watch it!

17:57.913 --> 18:01.030
Two time, bring it up!
Don't drop the pizza!

18:07.033 --> 18:09.308
Pizza delivery for Robbery-Homicide.

18:09.793 --> 18:11.590
Robbery-Homicide?

18:12.113 --> 18:14.547
Why is it I don't see
Robbery-Homicide...

18:14.753 --> 18:16.903
...with a pizza delivery
in the log-in sheet?

18:17.153 --> 18:20.429
I'll tell you what. Why don't you
leave that pizza with me?

18:20.633 --> 18:23.750
No, I'll tell you what.
Last time I left a pizza here...

18:23.953 --> 18:25.591
...it magically disappeared.

18:25.833 --> 18:28.472
I mean, it's just like
leaving candy around me.

18:28.713 --> 18:32.262
It's not gonna be all right.
I'm gonna chomp it up. See?

18:32.633 --> 18:34.749
Two kinds of people
get through that door:

18:34.993 --> 18:37.507
People wearing handcuffs.
People wearing a badge.

18:37.753 --> 18:39.391
You don't have on either.

18:40.953 --> 18:44.104
Well, I don't have
a badge or handcuffs, so....

18:44.353 --> 18:45.229
Officer Carlson.

18:45.593 --> 18:49.347
-We wanna flip that card right over.
-Sorry. Just got it.

18:49.953 --> 18:51.306
Excuse me, officer.

18:52.793 --> 18:56.263
The guys in Homicide ordered this pizza
about an hour ago.

18:58.433 --> 19:00.947
I don't wanna leave them
with Shamu over there.

19:02.713 --> 19:04.066
What do you want me to do?

19:04.273 --> 19:05.069
Take them!

19:05.273 --> 19:07.548
-I'm on duty. I can't do that.
-Yes, you can!

19:07.753 --> 19:09.550
Please take that!

19:11.353 --> 19:12.945
Thank you very much!

19:16.073 --> 19:17.631
Break it down.

19:20.033 --> 19:21.546
Two time, left!

19:21.793 --> 19:23.863
One time! Break it down to the ground!

19:24.233 --> 19:25.143
Go here!

19:25.353 --> 19:27.583
Left leg! Bring it around!

19:29.233 --> 19:30.586
Walk!

19:37.873 --> 19:39.829
You hid a diamond
in the police station?

19:40.033 --> 19:43.389
I didn't know it was a police station.
Can you change the l.D. or not?

19:43.593 --> 19:47.632
Sure, but won't they be suspicious of
a pizza man with a security clearance?

19:47.833 --> 19:49.869
I'm not going back as a pizza man.

19:50.113 --> 19:51.182
What are you going as?

19:51.393 --> 19:52.223
A cop.

19:52.473 --> 19:53.428
A cop?

19:53.753 --> 19:54.663
A new transfer.

19:54.873 --> 19:58.343
That's why I need that l.D.
and a new file for detective.

19:58.953 --> 19:59.942
Why a detective?

20:00.153 --> 20:01.950
That's where the rock is.

20:04.713 --> 20:06.226
It's gonna be expensive.

20:07.033 --> 20:09.422
Uncle Lou, I thought we was like family.

20:09.673 --> 20:12.233
Yeah, well, " Iike family" is not family.

20:12.433 --> 20:15.664
If you were family,
you'd want it for free, right?

20:17.233 --> 20:19.952
Well, you ain't changed.
I'll see you later.

20:31.793 --> 20:33.021
Get down!

20:33.233 --> 20:35.542
Put some clothes on!
Get your butt-naked ass down!

20:35.793 --> 20:37.511
Get your butt-naked ass down!

20:37.713 --> 20:40.944
He's naked and he's stinking.
Somebody get him some clothes.

20:41.193 --> 20:42.865
He's hiding a gun in his ass!

20:45.233 --> 20:47.303
Get on the ground. Do it now.

20:47.553 --> 20:48.588
Don't I know you?

20:49.633 --> 20:50.509
Freeze!

20:50.713 --> 20:51.509
Cuff him!

20:51.713 --> 20:53.305
Yeah, cuff his ass.

20:53.513 --> 20:55.344
I'm gonna cuff you like that.

20:55.593 --> 20:58.585
I'm the good cop.
You act up, I'll turn into the bad one.

21:04.073 --> 21:05.665
Freeze! Get them up!

21:05.873 --> 21:07.431
Spread your legs now.

21:07.753 --> 21:09.948
I'm an officer of the law.

21:12.993 --> 21:14.142
Any sign of Deacon?

21:14.433 --> 21:17.470
Last I heard, he was pulling
rip jobs in Carson.

21:18.713 --> 21:21.307
-I warned you about that guy.
-That you did.

21:21.513 --> 21:23.504
He'll know you're out.

21:24.673 --> 21:26.789
This is purely cosmetic.
It won't check out.

21:26.993 --> 21:30.508
Don't worry. I'll be out of there
in an hour, max. Thanks.

21:30.753 --> 21:31.549
Good luck.

21:47.913 --> 21:50.347
Hey there, officer dog.

21:50.793 --> 21:51.623
I'm a detective.

21:51.833 --> 21:52.788
Sorry, sir.

21:53.033 --> 21:54.102
She's never done that.

21:54.793 --> 21:56.511
Must be the pastrami.

21:56.913 --> 21:57.743
Bitch!

22:05.633 --> 22:06.543
Are you going up?

22:09.033 --> 22:10.227
Up. Third floor.

22:12.233 --> 22:13.746
Appreciate it.

22:28.153 --> 22:28.949
What?

22:29.553 --> 22:30.429
What?

22:54.913 --> 22:58.542
The vehicle belonged to your friend,
but you don't remember his name?

22:59.393 --> 23:00.712
Do you have a last name?

23:01.393 --> 23:03.748
Damn, these cuffs are tight, man!

23:05.193 --> 23:08.151
Miss Green, could you tell
this man to loosen these cuffs?

23:16.553 --> 23:18.783
I can't feel my fingers, man.
I'm serious. Please?

23:18.993 --> 23:20.631
-I know it.
-Detective.

23:21.193 --> 23:22.592
Not so tight.

23:23.793 --> 23:25.670
Maybe I could loosen them up a bit.

23:41.233 --> 23:44.191
You got a great lawyer there.
Top of the line. Here you go.

24:02.993 --> 24:04.108
He's in here!

24:07.793 --> 24:08.782
Jesus!

24:09.713 --> 24:10.702
How y'all doing?

24:11.313 --> 24:12.792
Not again, Carlson!

24:12.993 --> 24:14.585
The guy body-slammed me, sir.

24:14.833 --> 24:15.822
Maybe he likes you.

24:16.033 --> 24:17.148
He did what to you?

24:17.393 --> 24:20.988
Get him out of here! What were
you thinking? Man, that's not smart!

24:21.313 --> 24:22.587
Get him out of here.

24:25.193 --> 24:26.751
What the hell happened up there?

24:27.713 --> 24:28.828
Up here?

24:30.073 --> 24:32.303
I caught him trying to escape.

24:33.153 --> 24:34.552
Who the hell are you?

24:35.993 --> 24:38.109
Malone. Just transferred.
Right there.

24:38.313 --> 24:40.190
Yeah, check that out. Bam!

24:40.393 --> 24:41.542
-You know Malone?
-No.

24:41.753 --> 24:43.186
Nobody told me about it.

24:44.513 --> 24:45.662
Guys....

24:47.393 --> 24:48.223
Sorry, ma'am.

24:48.513 --> 24:50.151
Excuse me.

24:51.793 --> 24:53.624
Let me flush, please.

24:56.953 --> 25:00.343
I didn't know.
You might not wanna go in there.

25:02.553 --> 25:04.942
You got some paperwork for me, Malone?

25:06.033 --> 25:08.911
We've been requesting
a new detective for 8 months.

25:09.113 --> 25:13.026
Suddenly, you just turn up.
I'll never understand the system.

25:14.033 --> 25:17.343
Burglary? Sixteen citations,
mayor's commendation.

25:17.993 --> 25:20.143
You worked out of West Covina?

25:20.513 --> 25:22.390
Well, that's what it says right there.

25:23.113 --> 25:25.673
You look familiar, Malone.
Have we met before?

25:28.993 --> 25:31.746
You wouldn't happen to be
in a bowling league, would you?

25:33.833 --> 25:36.267
That's it. You're a bowler.

25:36.513 --> 25:37.309
I try.

25:37.513 --> 25:39.185
We could use a guy in Burglary.

25:41.113 --> 25:42.387
Right here.

25:42.633 --> 25:46.945
I thought I was gonna be assigned
to a desk. Right up in here!

25:47.153 --> 25:48.222
Are you kidding me?

25:48.433 --> 25:51.425
A guy like you?
No, you belong on the street.

25:51.953 --> 25:52.908
And also, listen.

25:53.113 --> 25:56.788
Carlson needs a partner with some
experience. He just got promoted.

25:57.273 --> 25:58.706
Chief, I just got a call.

25:58.913 --> 26:01.427
Malone's gonna join us.
Show him around.

26:03.153 --> 26:05.587
And let Malone do
all the handcuffing, okay?

26:07.113 --> 26:08.466
I appreciate that, yeah.

26:09.033 --> 26:09.863
I'll review these.

26:12.753 --> 26:15.187
This is the bullpen here.
That's Booking up there.

26:15.393 --> 26:18.351
The holding cells are down that way.
You wanna see them?

26:18.633 --> 26:20.544
Seen one, seen them all.

26:21.073 --> 26:22.426
This is my desk here, sir.

26:22.633 --> 26:23.952
Nice desk.

26:24.153 --> 26:26.223
Thanks. Let's see....

26:26.793 --> 26:27.862
Brass is on five.

26:28.073 --> 26:29.347
Robbery-Homicide on three.

26:29.553 --> 26:31.509
Over there, that's the tag and bag.

26:32.793 --> 26:35.353
-Through those doors, that's 1 0-1 7.
-Roger.

26:36.673 --> 26:37.947
Show him the rest later.

26:38.153 --> 26:39.666
-Come on.
-Where?

26:39.913 --> 26:42.552
We got a call. Burglary.
It's ours. I'll take this.

26:42.753 --> 26:43.549
Outside?

26:43.753 --> 26:45.345
That's where all the crime is.

26:45.553 --> 26:47.623
I just got here,
and that's not a good thing.

26:47.873 --> 26:51.183
I gotta do work in here so that
I know what's going on out there.

26:51.393 --> 26:52.951
I might need backup, right?

26:55.433 --> 26:57.071
How long you been in Burglary?

26:57.313 --> 26:59.827
Me? All my life, man, all my life.

27:00.033 --> 27:04.948
I heard the chief say that you got 1 6
citations. That's incredible! Sixteen!

27:05.233 --> 27:08.350
That's what happens when
your Uncle Lou writes your file.

27:11.393 --> 27:13.748
You can ride up front if you want.

27:15.393 --> 27:16.587
I knew that.

27:16.993 --> 27:20.383
You just gotta be real careful
for the pedestrians coming out here.

27:20.633 --> 27:22.191
Walking around out here.

27:23.033 --> 27:26.343
Am I clear to the right?
Am I clear? Have I got it?

27:29.233 --> 27:30.461
I just made detective.

27:30.673 --> 27:31.742
No kidding.

27:33.033 --> 27:36.423
I worked Traffic for three years.
I got pretty good at it.

27:39.153 --> 27:43.624
You don't have to stop for the yellow.
You could just drive right through.

27:43.833 --> 27:48.588
Sir, not if you'd seen some
of the accidents I've seen. No thanks.

27:49.353 --> 27:51.548
Well, there's your green right there.

27:55.313 --> 27:56.871
Can I ask you a personal question?

27:57.073 --> 27:58.711
Yeah, sure.

27:59.353 --> 28:01.184
How many times did you take the test?

28:02.433 --> 28:03.309
What test?

28:03.513 --> 28:06.152
You know, the test for detective.

28:06.673 --> 28:07.742
That one!

28:08.033 --> 28:09.352
-One time.
-Really?

28:09.793 --> 28:11.146
Aced it.

28:11.993 --> 28:13.392
Took it out.

28:13.593 --> 28:15.743
Took me five tries.

28:16.233 --> 28:20.067
I did well on the written part, but
my performance reviews weren't so hot.

28:20.273 --> 28:23.788
How many times did it take you
to get your driver's license, man?

28:23.993 --> 28:26.632
Please! Wake me up when we get there.

28:26.833 --> 28:28.505
Yes, sir. I'm sorry.

28:28.713 --> 28:30.544
Goodness, man!

28:31.593 --> 28:33.823
It's a nice suit, sir.
It's really cool.

28:34.033 --> 28:35.625
Well, I appreciate it.

28:35.833 --> 28:37.710
Yeah, you know? Appreciate it.

28:37.993 --> 28:38.789
Got any music?

28:38.993 --> 28:40.506
Oh, yeah. Sure.

28:41.433 --> 28:42.707
I like to jam.

28:42.913 --> 28:45.507
Just so long as
we can hear the dispatcher.

28:46.873 --> 28:48.192
That's good.

28:48.953 --> 28:52.741
-I never heard this station before.
-Kind of funky. You like that?

29:03.953 --> 29:07.263
Last night these shelves were loaded
with Elites. Now they're gone.

29:07.633 --> 29:09.066
Three dozen gorgeous rims.

29:09.313 --> 29:10.792
They didn't take anything else?

29:10.993 --> 29:14.952
They went for my good stuff. Chrome
with gold trim. Five grand worth.

29:15.913 --> 29:16.982
What about the alarm?

29:17.193 --> 29:18.990
What about it? It went off.

29:19.193 --> 29:21.229
But it took you guys
two hours to get here.

29:21.433 --> 29:23.549
My wheels are probably
in Tijuana by now.

29:23.753 --> 29:25.232
Here's where they came in.

29:26.513 --> 29:30.825
Looks like they broke the glass, opened
the handle, crawled in the window.

29:31.073 --> 29:32.062
Exactly.

29:32.273 --> 29:34.104
Shimmied down the shelf or something.

29:34.313 --> 29:35.462
This is a waste of time.

29:35.673 --> 29:37.265
That's not how they got in.

29:37.753 --> 29:38.947
Of course it is.

29:39.273 --> 29:41.184
Cut it out.
That's not how they got in.

29:41.433 --> 29:42.502
This is the spot here.

29:42.713 --> 29:44.465
That's how I would've came in.

29:45.113 --> 29:46.831
If I was a thief.

29:47.073 --> 29:48.745
If I was a thief!

29:48.953 --> 29:51.786
Skylight. Just cut the alarm
from the inside.

29:51.993 --> 29:53.711
I could take my time.

29:53.913 --> 29:54.868
Why take your time?

29:55.393 --> 29:56.872
Why would I take my time?

30:01.473 --> 30:02.747
It's heavy.

30:03.633 --> 30:05.066
Now, you tell me.

30:05.273 --> 30:09.824
How long would it take to carry 3 dozen
of those out and load them in a truck?

30:10.033 --> 30:12.706
-Long time.
-It would take a very long time.

30:12.913 --> 30:16.223
But they probably had three
or four guys working the damn thing--

30:16.433 --> 30:18.663
Zip! Zip the shit up! Frank, hush.

30:18.993 --> 30:21.109
Because you know better. Come on.

30:21.313 --> 30:25.022
Don't lie to me. I'm the man.
I'm the man, Frank.

30:25.273 --> 30:26.592
You're the man.

30:27.153 --> 30:31.465
Your 5000, sorry to tell you,
is worth less than two on the street.

30:31.713 --> 30:34.910
Which don't go four ways
with much juice once you rent a truck.

30:35.513 --> 30:39.028
And to rent a truck, that requires what?

30:39.833 --> 30:41.232
Credit card...

30:41.913 --> 30:43.949
...driver's license.

30:44.833 --> 30:46.391
Unless, of course...

30:47.313 --> 30:48.792
...you got your own truck.

30:50.753 --> 30:52.709
He's not gonna let us
search his truck.

30:52.913 --> 30:55.632
What you mean, " Iet us"? We the police.

30:55.833 --> 30:57.551
We need a warrant to do that.

30:57.793 --> 30:59.749
We don't even need a key.

31:01.633 --> 31:04.227
Detective, you can't do that.
It's unconstitutional.

31:04.993 --> 31:08.030
Look at that. Look at this.

31:11.593 --> 31:12.389
Look.

31:12.593 --> 31:15.391
Solved the crime
my first day on the job!

31:15.593 --> 31:16.867
We bad detectives.

31:17.073 --> 31:17.869
There they are!

31:18.153 --> 31:21.862
Filing a false report
is a very serious crime.

31:24.953 --> 31:28.343
I'll handle this.
Bring your weeble-wobble ass over here.

31:30.513 --> 31:33.152
-You like snacks?
-Nothing makes me happier.

31:33.353 --> 31:36.823
You'll be snacking on the bottom
of this shoe if this happens again.

31:37.033 --> 31:38.512
Now, you see them ridges?

31:38.713 --> 31:41.591
These ridges will be imprinted
on the back of your ass...

31:41.833 --> 31:44.188
...permanently if this happens again.

31:44.393 --> 31:45.382
You understand?

31:45.593 --> 31:46.708
Thoroughly understand you.

31:46.913 --> 31:50.588
Every time you look at your ass
there's gonna be a print there.

31:50.793 --> 31:52.511
It's gonna remind you of us.

31:53.193 --> 31:54.751
-And of you lying.
-Right.

31:55.233 --> 31:56.632
Don't wanna see those ridges.

31:56.873 --> 32:01.105
Stop eating cold cuts because
it's seeping through your pores.

32:01.313 --> 32:02.428
Will do.

32:02.713 --> 32:05.147
I'll put one ridge on your ass.

32:05.633 --> 32:08.943
Let's roll. That's cool.
Let's get out of here.

32:11.113 --> 32:13.183
Detective, I know I'm new at this...

32:13.393 --> 32:16.146
...but I thought we were supposed
to arrest the bad guys.

32:16.393 --> 32:18.145
Now he owes us one.

32:18.353 --> 32:19.672
So that's how it works.

32:20.033 --> 32:23.821
We let the little fish go, so that
we can catch the big fish later.

32:24.033 --> 32:25.386
I got it. I got it.

32:28.513 --> 32:31.505
You mind if I drive?
I know a shortcut.

32:35.593 --> 32:36.867
You might wanna buckle up.

32:45.033 --> 32:47.593
Are you in a hurry, sir?

32:47.833 --> 32:50.745
Just testing your car.
Balancing out your shit.

32:52.993 --> 32:55.382
When was the last time
you got all up on this thing?

32:55.673 --> 32:57.948
I've never gotten all up
on anything, sir.

32:59.113 --> 33:02.185
Sometimes you gotta feed
some speed to your ride.

33:04.793 --> 33:06.272
Sir! Watch it!

33:10.393 --> 33:13.146
This is the police!
Move your busted-ass vehicle!

33:13.633 --> 33:15.430
Move, move, move, move, move!

33:15.633 --> 33:17.146
This is the LAPD.

33:17.353 --> 33:18.786
We'll pop one in your ass.

33:18.993 --> 33:20.824
We got guns and shit.

33:22.153 --> 33:23.427
I could get used to this!

33:24.113 --> 33:24.909
I like!

33:25.113 --> 33:26.546
I like!

33:26.753 --> 33:27.868
Used to what?

33:30.673 --> 33:33.983
Driving. See, my last partner
did all the driving.

33:34.513 --> 33:36.151
Who was your partner?

33:37.633 --> 33:39.271
I don't wanna talk about it.

33:39.753 --> 33:40.708
Why?

33:41.153 --> 33:45.669
Hey, look, I'm deep, okay? There's
just some places I can't talk about.

33:45.913 --> 33:49.383
We're partners. We gotta communicate.
This thing's like a marriage.

33:49.633 --> 33:51.783
No, this is nothing like a marriage.

33:52.273 --> 33:54.946
-What is it like?
-It's more like a one-night stand.

33:55.193 --> 33:57.787
Wham, bam, thank you, officer.

34:02.233 --> 34:04.303
-It's like that?
-It's like that.

34:04.793 --> 34:08.103
We're just gonna fight crime
and zip the rest of that shit up.

34:08.353 --> 34:09.706
Are you married?

34:09.953 --> 34:11.351
-Girlfriend?
-Not anymore.

34:11.553 --> 34:12.429
What happened?

34:14.833 --> 34:16.551
Work got in the way.

34:17.592 --> 34:18.628
See?

34:23.592 --> 34:25.424
Somebody took out a fire hydrant.

34:31.713 --> 34:34.591
-I'll handle this.
-I gotta get back. I got a headache.

34:34.793 --> 34:36.545
We're on duty.

34:36.753 --> 34:40.587
But I need an aspirin.
A big one, like a hockey puck.

34:40.793 --> 34:42.192
Gentlemen. Excuse me.

34:42.433 --> 34:44.344
Could you come here for a second?

34:44.913 --> 34:46.949
Relax, sir.
Just take it easy for a second.

34:54.433 --> 34:55.946
Morning, officer.

34:59.113 --> 35:00.751
Morning. Where's your aspirins?

35:00.993 --> 35:02.790
Back there by the soda machines.

35:03.153 --> 35:03.949
Appreciate it.

35:13.953 --> 35:16.228
I wanna know how the car
hit the fire hydrant.

35:18.033 --> 35:19.864
-Open the register!
-Don't shoot!

35:20.113 --> 35:21.102
Come on, man!

35:21.393 --> 35:22.189
Oh, man!

35:22.433 --> 35:23.707
Come on! The safe too!

35:31.793 --> 35:32.589
Come on.

35:38.553 --> 35:42.182
37-King-5.
Shots fired. Request help.

35:42.393 --> 35:44.827
41 8 West Fifth Street.

35:51.713 --> 35:52.668
Detective Malone!

35:52.913 --> 35:53.948
You okay?

35:54.193 --> 35:54.989
Oh, shit!

35:57.833 --> 36:00.028
Get back! Back! Get back!

36:04.113 --> 36:05.592
Freeze!

36:05.793 --> 36:07.829
Put your hands on the pavement!

36:08.033 --> 36:10.547
-Hands on the pavement!
-There is no pavement!

36:11.233 --> 36:12.905
Put them on the Oodles of Noodles.

36:13.153 --> 36:15.064
-Put them on the noodles.
-Chicken or beef?

36:15.273 --> 36:16.103
Chicken!

36:17.673 --> 36:18.549
Cool.

36:18.793 --> 36:20.272
Cool is good.

36:21.113 --> 36:21.989
Miles?

36:22.433 --> 36:23.309
Tulley?

36:28.113 --> 36:28.943
What are you doing?

36:29.153 --> 36:31.303
What am I doing?
What are you doing?

36:31.553 --> 36:33.384
I'm freaking working over here.

36:35.113 --> 36:36.512
I'm coming in!

36:36.753 --> 36:38.345
Put the gun down!

36:38.593 --> 36:39.708
Put the gun down!

36:39.913 --> 36:41.346
Detective Malone, talk to me!

36:41.593 --> 36:43.151
Go out the back way!

36:43.393 --> 36:45.111
Go! The back way!

36:45.393 --> 36:46.985
Go out the back way!

36:47.873 --> 36:48.828
Detective, talk to me!

36:50.633 --> 36:51.782
Take two steps back!

36:53.353 --> 36:54.388
What the hell? Go!

36:55.953 --> 36:56.829
Hold it!

36:59.353 --> 37:00.342
Hold your fire!

37:03.593 --> 37:05.106
You okay?

37:28.713 --> 37:29.862
Listen, it's a dead end!

37:30.113 --> 37:31.705
No shit!

37:36.633 --> 37:40.023
He's behind those dumpsters.
He's freaking out. He's got a gun.

37:42.913 --> 37:43.823
Back up!

37:45.073 --> 37:48.748
Get SWAT up here! Sharpshooters
can take him off from the roof.

37:49.513 --> 37:50.992
No sharpshooters.

37:51.433 --> 37:52.263
Why the hell not?

37:54.113 --> 37:55.546
What are you doing here, man?

37:55.873 --> 37:57.784
-Who's he talking to?
-I don't know.

37:58.233 --> 38:01.111
He high, man. He's hallucinating.
Smoking that shit!

38:01.513 --> 38:03.151
He's high.

38:03.833 --> 38:05.471
Put down the gun and come out!

38:08.393 --> 38:10.384
Hold this. Hold on. I'm going in.

38:10.673 --> 38:11.469
What are you doing?

38:12.233 --> 38:13.552
What are you, crazy?

38:15.913 --> 38:17.551
Miles, what are you doing here?

38:17.993 --> 38:20.746
I just wanna talk to you
before somebody gets hurt!

38:21.033 --> 38:22.671
Please put down the gun!

38:22.913 --> 38:24.505
-Son, come on.
-Shut up!

38:24.713 --> 38:25.907
It hurts my heart...

38:26.113 --> 38:28.673
...to see a kid that has
so much potential.

38:28.913 --> 38:30.949
-You're smarter than that.
-I'm coming out!

38:31.953 --> 38:35.548
Listen. All right, now, goddamn it!
What are you doing?

38:35.793 --> 38:38.785
What are you doing?
You got me out here in this shit.

38:38.993 --> 38:40.984
How many times I told you...

38:41.233 --> 38:45.146
...forget the safe? Go straight for
the cash drawer. Get in and get out.

38:46.033 --> 38:48.308
He's in the way.
Now I can't even get a shot.

38:48.553 --> 38:49.747
I can't either.

38:49.993 --> 38:52.063
Why are you hitting
mom-and-pop stores anyway?

38:52.313 --> 38:54.224
Look, you're a driver, man.

38:54.433 --> 38:58.312
You got skills. You can be out there
on the road, man, doing your shit.

38:58.553 --> 39:02.387
I'm desperate! I need some money!
And why the freak are we whispering?

39:04.193 --> 39:06.502
Back up, nigger! I saw you!

39:08.433 --> 39:10.708
-What are they talking about?
-I don't know.

39:10.993 --> 39:14.622
I'm working on something here,
and you're blowing it for me, man!

39:15.353 --> 39:17.184
I'm sorry, man. I'm messing up.

39:17.433 --> 39:19.424
-I'm messing up.
-It's all right.

39:19.633 --> 39:21.225
Look, I'm not mad at you.

39:21.793 --> 39:25.627
But you're gonna have to give me
the gun and let me arrest you.

39:26.953 --> 39:31.708
Come on, man. Listen. I'll give you
1 0 grand. You know I'm good for it.

39:33.153 --> 39:34.506
I'm thinking like 50, man.

39:34.753 --> 39:38.109
Tulley, 50?
That's pushing it, man! Damn!

39:38.313 --> 39:42.022
Twenty, and you'll spend one night
in jail. That's the best I can do.

39:42.273 --> 39:44.150
That's it. Best I can do.

39:45.553 --> 39:47.942
All right, fine.
But I'm keeping my gun.

39:48.193 --> 39:52.027
You cannot let me arrest you
and keep the gun, man! Come on!

39:52.313 --> 39:54.781
Damn, I just got this, man.
This is hard to find.

39:54.993 --> 39:58.781
But you're gonna have to give up
the gun. Now, what you wanna do?

39:58.993 --> 40:03.384
You wanna give up the gun or you want
them to put about 7 bullets in your ass?

40:05.633 --> 40:07.191
Okay, now give me that gun!

40:09.433 --> 40:11.503
Don't just hand it to me!

40:11.753 --> 40:14.631
I gotta take it from you.
They're watching.

40:17.113 --> 40:18.546
This is gonna hurt a little.

40:19.393 --> 40:20.428
This is gonna hurt.

40:24.033 --> 40:25.102
Jesus!

40:25.353 --> 40:27.184
That's incredible!

40:27.713 --> 40:30.386
And remember:
You don't know me anymore.

40:30.633 --> 40:32.032
I sure don't.

40:32.233 --> 40:33.905
You didn't used to be so violent.

40:34.153 --> 40:36.109
So he's like,
" Carlson, take my jacket."

40:36.313 --> 40:39.510
He's like, " I got to do this."
We're like, "What are you doing?"

40:39.713 --> 40:42.910
He just goes right down the alley,
right up to the guy.

40:43.153 --> 40:45.621
Next thing you know,
he's taking the guy's gun.

40:45.833 --> 40:48.745
Dropped the guy with a punch.
Just levelled him.

40:48.993 --> 40:51.871
I mean, blink and
you would've missed it.

40:52.393 --> 40:53.906
Malone, in my office!

40:54.153 --> 40:55.552
Now!

40:59.513 --> 41:00.662
Not you, Carlson.

41:05.513 --> 41:07.469
I've been looking through your record.

41:07.873 --> 41:09.465
How come I never heard of you?

41:10.153 --> 41:12.428
I was undercover. On the down low.

41:12.633 --> 41:15.909
We need a guy to head Burglary.
Is that the real reason you're here?

41:17.353 --> 41:18.149
Yeah, sure.

41:18.353 --> 41:19.149
It's no secret.

41:19.393 --> 41:23.944
Burglary's been a problem division since
we lost our lead detective last year.

41:24.313 --> 41:26.827
Now, usually we promote
from within the ranks...

41:27.073 --> 41:28.904
...but these guys need someone new.

41:29.153 --> 41:31.348
So if you want the job, you got it.

41:34.113 --> 41:35.102
Excuse me?

41:35.433 --> 41:37.947
You're the new lead detective.
Burglary division.

41:40.393 --> 41:41.303
Me?

41:43.713 --> 41:47.945
Technically, there's a 30-day qualifying
period before I can make it official...

41:48.153 --> 41:51.350
...but with your record I don't think
there'll be any problem.

41:55.633 --> 41:57.385
Well, say something!

41:59.633 --> 42:01.146
Thank you.

42:01.393 --> 42:02.792
Let's party?

42:05.553 --> 42:07.191
What is this? High school?

42:07.393 --> 42:12.308
Listen up. As of now, Detective Malone
is Burglary's new acting lead detective.

42:12.593 --> 42:14.902
Get these processed ASAP.

42:15.993 --> 42:17.392
Thank you.

42:19.153 --> 42:22.350
I got some things I gotta do.
I'll catch up with you later.

42:23.153 --> 42:24.347
I'll take these.

42:24.553 --> 42:26.384
-You know what to do with these?
-Sure.

42:26.593 --> 42:27.946
Great, sir. Sorry.

42:36.833 --> 42:38.505
-Captain Penelli?
-I'm busy now.

42:55.433 --> 42:57.151
Oh, man!

43:16.833 --> 43:18.346
Shit!

43:20.433 --> 43:21.752
Damn!

43:32.793 --> 43:33.942
What?

43:34.473 --> 43:36.668
How do you want me
to handle the rotation?

43:37.753 --> 43:39.744
I don't understand.
What you mean, " rotation"?

43:39.953 --> 43:41.545
The shifts.

43:42.633 --> 43:46.228
I can't figure out everything
on the first day, all right?

43:46.433 --> 43:49.152
I notice you guys had a leak here.
What's that about?

43:49.353 --> 43:51.992
One of the hot-water pipes burst,
flooded all the vents.

43:53.153 --> 43:55.462
They had to flush out the whole system.

43:55.673 --> 43:58.107
This must be the guy
everybody's talking about.

43:58.313 --> 44:00.144
Captain Penelli, Detective Malone.

44:00.353 --> 44:01.627
Malone, Penelli.

44:02.513 --> 44:06.301
I hear great things.
It's a pleasure to meet you.

44:11.953 --> 44:13.750
Nice to meet you too there, sir!

44:13.953 --> 44:15.306
Very nice to meet you!

44:16.753 --> 44:17.947
Glad to be here.

44:18.193 --> 44:19.546
Gotta go!

44:23.193 --> 44:24.945
He's a strange one.

44:39.833 --> 44:41.551
Place is closed.

44:42.553 --> 44:45.272
I said we're closed.
I should've locked up.

44:45.913 --> 44:47.187
Nice to see you, Lou.

44:48.353 --> 44:49.945
I'm looking for Miles.

44:50.313 --> 44:52.304
Well, I haven't seen him.

44:52.513 --> 44:54.902
I got an important message
from his mother.

44:56.833 --> 44:58.710
Well, I still haven't seen him.

45:01.353 --> 45:02.581
Quiet.

45:07.433 --> 45:08.946
Damn, you're good.

45:14.073 --> 45:15.472
You are good.

45:57.273 --> 45:58.342
Good morning. Listen up.

45:58.553 --> 46:02.432
Word is that Jean LaFleur is bringing
a shipment of heroin through town.

46:04.673 --> 46:06.106
They want him in San Diego.

46:06.313 --> 46:08.269
SDPD's done an excellent job...

46:08.553 --> 46:11.465
...shutting down the harbor
and the airports on him.

46:19.473 --> 46:23.785
Detective Malone just transferred.
He'll head our Burglary division.

46:24.753 --> 46:25.981
Detective...

46:26.193 --> 46:28.263
...tell us a little about your plans.

46:30.353 --> 46:32.992
Well, I plan to fight crime.

46:38.313 --> 46:39.632
You know, shit like that.

46:39.833 --> 46:40.629
Great, then.

46:42.033 --> 46:44.103
Does anybody have any questions
for Malone?

46:44.313 --> 46:45.951
Yeah, I got a question.

46:46.193 --> 46:48.024
What do you think about the P-31 ?

46:49.353 --> 46:50.866
P-31 .

46:52.913 --> 46:53.789
What do you think?

46:53.993 --> 46:55.187
It's a piece of shit.

46:57.153 --> 47:00.907
What I mean is, we've all been having
problems with the P-31 , right?

47:01.113 --> 47:05.584
I'm just wondering what the new lead
detective here plans to do about it.

47:05.953 --> 47:09.184
Well, all right.
Well, Diaz, is it? Diaz?

47:09.513 --> 47:12.505
What do you think we should do
about it, Diaz?

47:12.873 --> 47:14.386
I think we should scrap it.

47:15.033 --> 47:17.991
How many people think
we should scrap the P-31 ?

47:20.433 --> 47:21.548
There it is.

47:21.753 --> 47:23.709
Scrapped. Why?
Because you want it scrapped.

47:23.913 --> 47:27.383
It's out of there. P-31 , out of there.
No more. Gone.

47:27.753 --> 47:29.664
You want 31 flavours?

47:29.873 --> 47:32.910
Baskin-Robbins is
where you wanna be. Be cool.

47:33.273 --> 47:34.865
That's my partner.

47:35.393 --> 47:36.223
Detective.

47:39.313 --> 47:41.065
What is it?

47:41.313 --> 47:42.871
I'd like to work with a P-40.

47:43.073 --> 47:44.188
Yeah, the P-40's good.

47:45.873 --> 47:47.352
P-40 it is!

47:51.753 --> 47:53.744
What's he doing?
We just got those things.

47:53.953 --> 47:57.070
He's shaking things up.
Maybe that's exactly what we need.

48:14.073 --> 48:15.665
I'm not a cop.

48:16.113 --> 48:18.547
This Tulley asshole
wants to talk to you.

48:18.753 --> 48:20.425
He's down in lnterrogation.

48:22.153 --> 48:24.064
Right away. I'll talk with him.

48:24.953 --> 48:26.625
Interrogation's this way.

48:26.833 --> 48:29.108
Knew that. Is he running his mouth?

48:29.953 --> 48:32.911
Tulley says he has information
about another robbery.

48:33.113 --> 48:35.752
But he'll only talk
to the officer who arrested him.

48:37.313 --> 48:39.304
I'll talk to him. Alone.

48:39.513 --> 48:41.071
We'll be watching.

48:43.153 --> 48:46.463
What's going on? You said
I'd spend one night in jail.

48:57.033 --> 48:59.501
What do you wanna tell me?
What is it?

48:59.713 --> 49:01.704
You said I'd only spend
one night in jail.

49:01.913 --> 49:03.551
It's only been one night.

49:03.753 --> 49:05.550
Well, where's my 50 grand?

49:05.873 --> 49:07.591
I said 20 grand.

49:08.073 --> 49:10.143
Well, maybe it's 50 now! Because--

49:14.273 --> 49:17.743
Detectives, I've been assigned
to Mr. Tulley.

49:17.953 --> 49:20.342
Well, great. That's him.

49:20.553 --> 49:23.386
Oh, my God! What in the world?

49:23.593 --> 49:25.026
-Help me!
-What's going on?

49:26.233 --> 49:27.109
Help!

49:27.313 --> 49:28.428
What is this?

49:32.033 --> 49:33.671
Oh, my God!

49:37.753 --> 49:40.506
Take your hands off my client!

49:41.393 --> 49:42.872
It's no use. He ain't talking!

49:43.073 --> 49:44.950
You have your hand over his mouth!

49:50.673 --> 49:54.348
I think we accomplished
enough for one day.

49:54.673 --> 49:57.870
This guy said he has information
on another case.

49:58.153 --> 50:00.428
I wanna know, are you jerking
our chain or not?

50:00.633 --> 50:02.351
I'm not jerking your chain, fella.

50:02.553 --> 50:06.512
This guy Logan owes me
50 thousand dollars.

50:07.313 --> 50:09.190
If I don't get it soon...

50:09.393 --> 50:11.190
...l'm talking!

50:11.393 --> 50:13.782
Who's Logan?
And what do you know about him?

50:14.313 --> 50:18.101
All I can tell you, sir,
is that he's gay, gay, gay!

50:18.313 --> 50:19.826
I've had enough of this!

50:20.033 --> 50:23.742
You certainly have. Come with me.
You'll be hearing from my office!

50:23.953 --> 50:26.228
-He made me bite my tongue.
-Come here.

50:26.873 --> 50:27.783
He hit me here.

50:28.233 --> 50:30.269
Next time use a phone book on him.

50:30.473 --> 50:32.111
And they took my shoelace.

50:32.313 --> 50:33.905
Hearing from your office!

50:34.113 --> 50:35.910
Look how she's all over him.

50:36.153 --> 50:39.065
And then he said I was ugly
and I couldn't read good.

50:43.753 --> 50:45.311
Hey, man. What's up?

50:45.513 --> 50:47.469
Some guy's been calling for you.

50:47.673 --> 50:49.709
-Who was it?
-Said he's your old partner.

50:49.913 --> 50:53.701
He hopes you found what you're looking
for. Your health benefits expire soon.

50:54.073 --> 50:56.064
Whatever the hell
that's supposed to mean.

51:00.033 --> 51:01.671
Shit!

51:25.553 --> 51:26.349
Bingo!

51:29.673 --> 51:32.471
What is it with you
and the heating ducts, sir?

51:33.553 --> 51:35.066
Cold. You don't feel that?

51:35.553 --> 51:36.542
Very cold.

51:36.753 --> 51:39.062
But I'm busy. What is it you want?

51:39.273 --> 51:41.741
I just tried to pull up your records.

51:41.953 --> 51:43.352
I couldn't find any Malone.

51:43.913 --> 51:47.030
Oh, that's probably because
it was spelled....

51:47.233 --> 51:49.110
When I put the name in the list--

51:49.313 --> 51:51.269
The badge number doesn't exist.

51:53.113 --> 51:54.023
Let me talk to you.

51:54.233 --> 51:57.430
-I wanna find out what's going on.
-You're gonna find out.

52:00.513 --> 52:01.866
Now, look.

52:02.833 --> 52:04.744
What I'm about to tell you
is classified.

52:04.953 --> 52:08.741
You tell anyone, I will bust
your ass down to parade detail.

52:08.953 --> 52:10.352
I've been on that detail.

52:10.553 --> 52:13.465
That's permanent horseshit patrol.

52:16.273 --> 52:19.390
This place is a cesspool. But listen.

52:19.713 --> 52:21.066
I'm not from West Covina.

52:22.033 --> 52:23.512
I'm from lnternal Affairs.

52:23.753 --> 52:25.869
Oh, man!

52:29.833 --> 52:32.347
All right? This place is a cesspool.

52:33.033 --> 52:35.501
-I can't believe I didn't notice!
-It is!

52:35.713 --> 52:37.783
I mean, it doesn't seem like a cesspool.

52:37.993 --> 52:41.110
Believe it, man! There's a lot
of dirty shit going on here!

52:41.313 --> 52:43.065
That's why they sent me here.

52:43.273 --> 52:45.787
I'm the supercop.
They said, "Go, investigate.

52:46.113 --> 52:47.944
Do what you do.
Find another supercop.

52:48.153 --> 52:50.986
Y'all supercop up as a team,
and crack down the shit."

52:51.353 --> 52:53.423
" Crack it down."
That's what I'm here to do.

52:53.633 --> 52:56.943
Are we the only guys that know about it?
We're in the shit now!

53:02.033 --> 53:03.830
You are a good cop, Carlson.

53:04.033 --> 53:06.752
But damn it, man,
you just dug too deep.

53:06.953 --> 53:08.545
What do you want me to do?

53:08.753 --> 53:10.471
Good thing you asked.

53:11.073 --> 53:14.827
Keep your eyes open. Okay?
I need you to be here.

53:15.033 --> 53:17.228
And watch my back. Watch my back.

53:17.433 --> 53:19.867
Got it, sir. I'm out of here.

53:20.473 --> 53:21.906
The other way. Go back.

53:26.113 --> 53:27.262
Shit!

53:46.033 --> 53:47.546
Evidence room.

53:47.873 --> 53:48.828
Shit!

53:52.273 --> 53:55.185
There you are. I just got a call.

53:55.393 --> 53:56.951
41 3 in progress
at the airport.

53:57.153 --> 53:58.302
Go ahead. I'll catch up.

53:58.513 --> 54:02.392
Bullshit! Someone just stole
a museum exhibit from a cargo hold.

54:02.593 --> 54:03.742
That's my problem?

54:04.153 --> 54:05.472
You're lead detective.

54:05.713 --> 54:07.943
Get out there now!

54:08.153 --> 54:11.463
The FBI and Customs Service
is already on the case.

54:30.793 --> 54:33.102
-Why are you standing here?
-They won't let me in.

54:33.313 --> 54:34.666
Feds are all over it.

54:34.873 --> 54:36.386
That's bullshit!

54:37.753 --> 54:40.745
These boxes contained
an entire Egyptian temple.

54:40.953 --> 54:43.421
Excuse me, here.
Let me see this. Man!

54:43.633 --> 54:44.702
And who are you?

54:44.913 --> 54:47.427
Malone. LAPD.

54:47.633 --> 54:49.305
Agent Gray. FBl.

54:50.313 --> 54:52.907
We'll let you boys in
after we're done.

54:55.593 --> 54:57.026
Look at all this stuff.

54:57.233 --> 55:01.306
Look. They nearly destroyed all this
stuff and they didn't take none of it.

55:01.553 --> 55:03.589
Look, Officer Malone.

55:03.793 --> 55:04.987
Detective.

55:05.193 --> 55:09.311
You know, you're out of your
jurisdiction and you're over your head.

55:09.513 --> 55:12.630
I'm over my head?
No, I'm over your head...

55:12.833 --> 55:14.664
...because your head's up your ass.

55:16.473 --> 55:20.466
You're interfering with
a federal investigation, officer.

55:20.873 --> 55:23.546
Now, if you and your bunch
wanna feel important...

55:23.753 --> 55:25.983
...you can help secure
the outer perimeter.

55:26.753 --> 55:27.868
Are we clear?

55:31.033 --> 55:32.671
We clear.

55:33.153 --> 55:34.745
And please...

55:34.953 --> 55:38.548
...tell your men not to touch
anything on their way out.

55:38.753 --> 55:41.472
-It's like that?
-Yeah, it's like that.

55:51.233 --> 55:53.064
" Head up your ass."
That was great.

55:53.313 --> 55:55.463
I couldn't believe you said that.

55:55.753 --> 55:57.584
He called me "officer."

55:57.793 --> 56:02.503
I'm lead detective.
I have 1 6 citations.

56:02.713 --> 56:04.112
You think that comes easy?

56:04.313 --> 56:06.827
Come on. The guy's nothing
but an FBI asshole.

56:07.033 --> 56:09.911
He thinks we're good for nothing
but sucking down doughnuts.

56:10.113 --> 56:11.990
Let them chase their own
goddamn temple.

56:12.193 --> 56:15.742
They weren't looking for no temple.
They were looking for drugs.

56:15.953 --> 56:17.147
Yes, drugs.

56:17.353 --> 56:19.150
It's the oldest trick in the book.

56:19.353 --> 56:20.388
You smuggle it in...

56:20.593 --> 56:24.791
...boost it before it hits customs,
right? Make it look like a heist.

56:24.993 --> 56:26.790
That's how all the big boys do it.

56:27.033 --> 56:29.831
All they have to do is
look for a truck with a " B" on it.

56:30.273 --> 56:31.501
What do you mean, " B"?

56:31.713 --> 56:33.066
" Bonded."

56:33.473 --> 56:37.261
Bonded trucks can get
into bonded warehouses.

56:37.753 --> 56:38.663
Let me ask you:

56:39.233 --> 56:40.871
How do you know all this stuff?

56:42.713 --> 56:45.864
Did a little work in bonded warehouses.

56:46.353 --> 56:48.503
All right. So what are we waiting for?

56:48.913 --> 56:52.223
Let's do something, all right?
Come on. Call in air support.

56:53.433 --> 56:56.152
Dispatch, this is 37-King-5...

56:56.353 --> 56:59.743
...put me through
to South Bay air support.

57:05.313 --> 57:07.622
10-12. I've got a white panel truck...

57:07.833 --> 57:11.985
...B-961, southbound on Wheeler
near the Manhattan Beach intersection.

57:12.193 --> 57:13.831
Roger. We're close.

57:17.393 --> 57:18.508
Shit!

57:23.073 --> 57:24.392
Now you're in a hurry?

57:25.273 --> 57:29.391
Sometimes you gotta feed a little speed
to your ride. You know what I'm saying?

57:40.753 --> 57:41.822
Here we go.

57:45.673 --> 57:47.265
Check out the driver.

57:48.353 --> 57:51.504
Five-feet-six, greasy hair, messy,
very dishevelled and--

57:51.713 --> 57:54.352
Are you a hairdresser
or a detective, man?

57:55.633 --> 57:56.952
That's a jailhouse tat.

57:57.353 --> 57:59.105
Driver did a stretch somewhere.

57:59.313 --> 58:00.985
1 0-1 2. Requesting backup.

58:01.193 --> 58:03.468
LAPD, this is Agent Gray. FBl.

58:03.673 --> 58:06.790
Stand down. I repeat.: Stand down.

58:07.073 --> 58:08.506
This is bullshit!

58:08.713 --> 58:11.273
Screw them. Come on! Let's do it!

58:12.073 --> 58:13.552
Come on, you!

58:15.393 --> 58:16.542
Come on, get the door.

58:16.753 --> 58:17.663
Come on!

58:19.313 --> 58:20.223
Drop your weapons!

58:20.433 --> 58:21.866
Put it down.

58:22.073 --> 58:25.110
All right, don't move! Stand still!

58:25.313 --> 58:26.109
Put it down!

58:26.833 --> 58:29.267
Malone! Take him! He's yours!

58:30.753 --> 58:33.108
Don't you run from me! Don't you run!

58:33.353 --> 58:35.423
Let's see those hands, butterball.

58:37.513 --> 58:38.309
Come here!

58:38.513 --> 58:40.026
You wanna make me run?

58:45.273 --> 58:46.183
Come back here!

59:05.513 --> 59:06.502
Come back here!

59:10.193 --> 59:11.308
Bring your ass here!

59:11.873 --> 59:12.703
Come here!

59:18.753 --> 59:19.868
Come here!

59:20.553 --> 59:22.464
It's okay. Don't worry. I'm a cop.

59:24.313 --> 59:25.462
All right?

59:26.713 --> 59:27.509
Damn!

59:32.273 --> 59:34.423
Don't you know better
than to run from the police?

59:34.633 --> 59:35.429
I do.

59:35.633 --> 59:39.182
You got me tired. I don't like
to get tired. When I get tired...

59:39.393 --> 59:40.587
...l got ass to whup.

59:41.193 --> 59:43.661
That's what I'm about to do.
Get your ass up!

59:48.433 --> 59:49.627
Bingo.

59:49.913 --> 59:51.471
That's the shit.

59:55.913 --> 59:59.986
We showed them. We showed them, and
that's what I wanted to do, you know?

01:00:00.193 --> 01:00:01.945
-Put this into evidence.
-Exactly.

01:00:02.153 --> 01:00:03.825
Evidence. I'll go up with it.

01:00:04.033 --> 01:00:06.149
I want you interrogating
those men right now.

01:00:06.353 --> 01:00:08.742
No. See, I need to go up
with this stuff...

01:00:08.953 --> 01:00:11.069
...and book it into evidence personally.

01:00:11.273 --> 01:00:12.069
Why?

01:00:13.913 --> 01:00:16.507
I gotta go through it
for clues and shit.

01:00:17.033 --> 01:00:20.025
Interrogate the suspects.
Find out where they were going.

01:00:20.553 --> 01:00:24.671
Then, when you get them to talk, you can
go through all the evidence you want.

01:00:24.873 --> 01:00:26.670
But, sir....

01:00:27.553 --> 01:00:32.024
If I get the clue, it'd make
for a better ass-whupping interrogation.

01:00:32.233 --> 01:00:34.064
Let's hear it for Detective Malone!

01:00:46.033 --> 01:00:48.706
That's it! I want a lawyer.
You cops can't do this.

01:00:48.953 --> 01:00:50.466
I got news for you.
I ain't a cop.

01:00:52.913 --> 01:00:54.312
God, he's good.

01:00:54.513 --> 01:00:56.788
I checked.
West Covina never heard of him.

01:00:57.753 --> 01:00:59.744
-So you know.
-Know what?

01:00:59.953 --> 01:01:01.306
He's lnternal Affairs.

01:01:01.513 --> 01:01:03.549
What are you talking about?
He's not l.A.

01:01:03.753 --> 01:01:04.549
He's not?

01:01:04.753 --> 01:01:05.947
Hell, no. He's FBl.

01:01:07.433 --> 01:01:09.344
But he hates the FBl.

01:01:09.553 --> 01:01:12.465
That's to throw you off.
You think this is an accident?

01:01:12.673 --> 01:01:16.143
He knew about the heroin from the start.
FBI planted him here.

01:01:16.353 --> 01:01:19.823
Thought he'd get first jump on the
burglary. Afraid we'd screw it up.

01:01:20.153 --> 01:01:21.791
Pencil-dicks.

01:01:25.233 --> 01:01:27.667
You don't get that training
at the academy.

01:01:27.873 --> 01:01:29.545
No, that's old school, man.

01:01:29.753 --> 01:01:31.425
You're crushing my head!

01:01:33.833 --> 01:01:35.585
That's federal government training.

01:01:35.793 --> 01:01:38.261
Like Navy SEAL stuff.

01:01:40.713 --> 01:01:42.385
Let's go give him a hand.

01:01:44.753 --> 01:01:47.870
All right! All right!
I'll talk! Oh, man!

01:02:20.313 --> 01:02:22.110
Look at you.

01:02:22.313 --> 01:02:25.623
It was all worth it for you, baby.

01:02:31.873 --> 01:02:33.192
What are you doing up there?

01:02:34.353 --> 01:02:38.949
I'm just so happy that we're keeping
these drugs off the street.

01:02:39.153 --> 01:02:41.747
Get over it. They're going
right back out again.

01:02:41.953 --> 01:02:42.829
Why?

01:02:43.033 --> 01:02:46.105
Because the FBI wants to take it
to their lab right away.

01:02:46.313 --> 01:02:47.382
Roll it out.

01:02:51.833 --> 01:02:52.629
Malone, come on!

01:02:53.113 --> 01:02:54.466
Let's go.

01:02:55.913 --> 01:02:57.062
Come on, Malone.

01:03:09.753 --> 01:03:10.902
Detective.

01:03:12.033 --> 01:03:14.627
That heroin belongs to Jean LaFleur.

01:03:14.993 --> 01:03:16.551
We've been after him for 5 years.

01:03:16.753 --> 01:03:19.586
He keeps shifting his operations
between the U.S. and Mexico.

01:03:19.913 --> 01:03:22.143
We're taking it down
to our lab right now.

01:03:22.353 --> 01:03:23.832
That's not a good idea.

01:03:24.033 --> 01:03:24.909
Why not?

01:03:26.473 --> 01:03:28.145
Why don't we just keep it here?

01:03:28.353 --> 01:03:31.629
LaFleur doesn't know we have it.
We could use it for bait.

01:03:32.953 --> 01:03:34.022
You mean a sting?

01:03:34.353 --> 01:03:36.867
Exactly. A sting!

01:03:37.753 --> 01:03:41.382
LaFleur expects these drugs
to be in San Diego in three hours.

01:03:41.633 --> 01:03:44.830
What kind of sting operation can you
get off the ground before then?

01:03:45.473 --> 01:03:48.146
The driver told me one of the guys
on the truck was new.

01:03:48.353 --> 01:03:50.344
You can replace him with somebody else.

01:03:50.553 --> 01:03:54.341
Then catch LaFleur when he goes
to pick up the drugs. Bam! Got him!

01:03:54.553 --> 01:03:55.827
Let me get this straight.

01:03:56.033 --> 01:03:59.742
You're volunteering to escort
these drugs into the hands...

01:03:59.953 --> 01:04:02.831
...of the most dangerous dealer
in the northern hemisphere?

01:04:03.153 --> 01:04:04.142
Hell, no!

01:04:04.353 --> 01:04:05.945
What do you need to make it work?

01:04:07.433 --> 01:04:09.742
-Me?
-You're the man for the job!

01:04:09.953 --> 01:04:12.706
FBI will have tactical command,
but we'll follow your lead.

01:04:12.913 --> 01:04:15.746
It's very brave. Let's go.
There's not much time.

01:04:15.953 --> 01:04:17.671
Way to go, Malone. Way to go.

01:04:17.913 --> 01:04:21.303
-I'm just suggesting some shit.
-We need more men like you!

01:04:24.313 --> 01:04:27.146
All right. Hurry up.
Go. Get out of here!

01:04:27.433 --> 01:04:29.151
Wait. Hold up. Wait a minute.

01:04:29.353 --> 01:04:32.311
You wanted to go.
I'm getting you out of here. Go!

01:04:32.553 --> 01:04:35.272
You wouldn't still be here
unless that diamond was here.

01:04:35.473 --> 01:04:36.269
I want my cut!

01:04:36.673 --> 01:04:39.870
There ain't nothing to cut.
I gotta get the diamond first.

01:04:40.113 --> 01:04:41.262
Go get it. I'll wait.

01:04:41.473 --> 01:04:44.351
I'm trying to. First, I gotta
run a sting on a drug dealer.

01:04:44.713 --> 01:04:46.032
You're a goddamn liar!

01:04:46.233 --> 01:04:48.906
Would I make this shit up?
Get out of here!

01:04:49.113 --> 01:04:52.105
-I'll see you at Lou's tomorrow.
-I wanna talk about this!

01:04:52.313 --> 01:04:54.224
I don't know what you're doing...

01:04:54.433 --> 01:04:55.832
...but it ain't gonna work!

01:04:56.073 --> 01:04:57.825
And let me get my gun back!

01:05:04.033 --> 01:05:07.662
Look. Maybe this isn't
a good idea, you know?

01:05:07.873 --> 01:05:10.706
-This is a great idea. It'll work.
-Brilliant.

01:05:10.913 --> 01:05:14.144
-LaFleur's looking for this.
-We know what we're doing, detective.

01:05:14.353 --> 01:05:16.025
Oh, I'm a detective now.

01:05:16.713 --> 01:05:18.032
Give us a level, please.

01:05:19.113 --> 01:05:20.512
All right, detective.

01:05:20.713 --> 01:05:24.752
The objective is to have these men
see you as if you were one of them:

01:05:25.113 --> 01:05:28.662
A member of the criminal underworld.
It's important your speech...

01:05:28.913 --> 01:05:33.543
...and your behaviour are congruent with
their expectation of a fellow criminal.

01:05:33.753 --> 01:05:36.313
I get it. Sort of "walk the walk."

01:05:36.513 --> 01:05:37.389
That's right.

01:05:37.913 --> 01:05:40.347
You have to look, act...

01:05:40.553 --> 01:05:42.748
...and even think like a criminal.

01:05:42.953 --> 01:05:44.671
Change your speech patterns too.

01:05:44.913 --> 01:05:48.906
Criminals like to use slang terminology
and profanity and so forth...

01:05:49.113 --> 01:05:52.310
...especially with regard to police
and authority figures.

01:05:52.553 --> 01:05:55.192
You mean like, "Shut the hell up,
you dickless FBl--"

01:05:55.393 --> 01:05:57.111
-That's right.
-"You stupid ass."

01:05:57.313 --> 01:05:58.632
-That'll do.
-"You tight--"

01:05:58.833 --> 01:05:59.982
Enough!

01:06:01.713 --> 01:06:02.748
All right, listen up.

01:06:02.953 --> 01:06:04.625
LaFleur's a killer.

01:06:04.833 --> 01:06:09.384
If he senses anything amiss, Malone
is gonna be in one hell of a tight spot.

01:06:14.553 --> 01:06:17.829
If anything happens to me,
forget everything I ever told you.

01:06:18.033 --> 01:06:20.024
You mean about lnternal Affairs?

01:06:20.233 --> 01:06:21.951
No, Carlson. I mean about everything.

01:06:22.273 --> 01:06:24.150
Detective, saddle up.

01:06:24.353 --> 01:06:25.866
Good luck.

01:06:30.153 --> 01:06:32.906
Carlson, remember. Forget it!

01:06:33.113 --> 01:06:34.182
Time to go.

01:06:36.673 --> 01:06:37.549
Detective.

01:06:38.153 --> 01:06:41.782
If my client gets a scratch
on him while he's in your custody...

01:06:41.993 --> 01:06:46.783
...l'll see your badge is revoked
and you're thrown in jail. Okay?

01:06:46.993 --> 01:06:48.472
You can't touch me.

01:06:51.473 --> 01:06:55.022
He'll be fine, counsellor.
Malone, let's get this show on the road.

01:06:56.033 --> 01:06:57.625
Drive. Buckle up.

01:07:00.553 --> 01:07:01.383
Give me video.

01:07:01.593 --> 01:07:02.946
Let's get one thing straight.

01:07:03.153 --> 01:07:05.747
This is my side here
and that's your side there.

01:07:05.953 --> 01:07:08.069
Stay on your side
and I'm gonna stay on mine.

01:07:08.753 --> 01:07:09.663
Gentlemen.

01:07:09.873 --> 01:07:11.352
Keep the chatter to a minimum.

01:07:11.553 --> 01:07:14.465
You don't like the show,
change the channel.

01:07:14.833 --> 01:07:16.903
And keep this channel clear.

01:07:20.513 --> 01:07:22.265
Who is this guy?

01:07:22.713 --> 01:07:23.748
That's Malone.

01:07:25.393 --> 01:07:26.792
I can't drive if you do that.

01:07:27.353 --> 01:07:28.672
Drive!

01:07:47.553 --> 01:07:48.906
We're coming up on our exit.

01:07:50.753 --> 01:07:53.870
All units, this is Gray.
Fall back and keep your distance.

01:08:03.753 --> 01:08:05.152
We're approaching the site.

01:08:05.353 --> 01:08:07.583
LAPD, take the south side.
We'll take the north.

01:08:31.553 --> 01:08:33.987
They're headed into warehouse 3.

01:08:34.233 --> 01:08:35.063
Focus in.

01:08:35.273 --> 01:08:36.069
Closer.

01:08:44.033 --> 01:08:44.863
This is it.

01:08:45.073 --> 01:08:46.904
-You sure?
-Yeah. Warehouse 3.

01:08:47.233 --> 01:08:51.350
All right, Benny, sit tight
and keep your mouth shut.

01:08:51.553 --> 01:08:52.702
Thanks for the tip.

01:08:59.073 --> 01:09:00.221
What's Malone doing?

01:09:07.712 --> 01:09:09.544
They're coming in behind you.

01:09:09.752 --> 01:09:11.584
Get ready. Here he comes.

01:09:16.433 --> 01:09:18.582
That's what I'm talking about!

01:09:19.353 --> 01:09:21.344
-That's the shit.
-You're right!

01:09:21.553 --> 01:09:23.669
All 500 kilos!

01:09:24.473 --> 01:09:27.510
What are you talking about?
Let's get out! I want my cut!

01:09:27.712 --> 01:09:29.749
-You still got it?
-We still have a signal.

01:09:29.953 --> 01:09:30.988
It's just distorted.

01:09:32.153 --> 01:09:33.268
Can you hear him?

01:09:33.473 --> 01:09:36.510
We can't get out of here, okay?
They got cops everywhere.

01:09:36.712 --> 01:09:37.987
So? You're one of them.

01:09:40.073 --> 01:09:41.267
I'm a drug dealer now.

01:09:41.752 --> 01:09:44.551
Man, listen to me.
You're a jewel thief.

01:09:45.073 --> 01:09:47.143
I'm a drug dealer now!

01:09:47.353 --> 01:09:49.867
Why you selling this
when you got that diamond?

01:09:50.593 --> 01:09:51.707
Just like old times.

01:09:52.553 --> 01:09:54.305
I don't believe that shit!

01:09:56.273 --> 01:09:57.422
Is this a reunion?

01:09:57.633 --> 01:10:00.511
Look what we got here. Give it up.

01:10:01.353 --> 01:10:03.105
Isn't that beautiful? Say bye.

01:10:03.873 --> 01:10:04.783
Welcome to the party.

01:10:05.153 --> 01:10:06.142
Son of a bitch!

01:10:06.873 --> 01:10:08.101
We've lost him.

01:10:08.313 --> 01:10:10.827
I'll enjoy doing you more
than I did Eddie.

01:10:11.353 --> 01:10:12.468
Shut up!

01:10:21.193 --> 01:10:22.785
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

01:10:22.993 --> 01:10:25.063
-Know anything about this?
-I don't know shit!

01:10:25.273 --> 01:10:26.626
I'm gonna throw up.

01:10:33.913 --> 01:10:34.743
What the hell?

01:10:34.953 --> 01:10:37.069
All units, stand by.

01:10:42.113 --> 01:10:42.909
What's going on?

01:10:43.113 --> 01:10:44.102
I don't know!

01:10:45.153 --> 01:10:46.632
I never know what's going on!

01:10:52.353 --> 01:10:53.183
Take it down!

01:10:53.393 --> 01:10:54.428
Here! Bring it in!

01:11:03.193 --> 01:11:04.865
Out of the truck. Out of the truck!

01:11:10.233 --> 01:11:11.632
Benny, what's going on?

01:11:12.073 --> 01:11:13.347
It took longer than I thought.

01:11:13.633 --> 01:11:15.510
-What happened to your face?
-Nothing.

01:11:15.713 --> 01:11:16.509
Not a big deal.

01:11:16.753 --> 01:11:18.106
Who hired these two guys?

01:11:18.313 --> 01:11:20.031
I did. You told me to get guys.

01:11:20.953 --> 01:11:22.830
You didn't introduce me.
How you doing?

01:11:23.033 --> 01:11:25.752
Pete. Nice to meet you.
Heard a lot about you.

01:11:27.353 --> 01:11:28.547
And who might you be?

01:11:29.673 --> 01:11:32.392
Don't mess with him.
That's a stone-cold killer.

01:11:32.793 --> 01:11:35.432
You don't want to mess with him.
He's stone-cold.

01:11:36.033 --> 01:11:40.743
That boy is bad. I seen him rip
somebody's guts out through their ass...

01:11:41.033 --> 01:11:42.546
...and their eyes fell out.

01:11:42.753 --> 01:11:43.742
Do the move you do!

01:11:43.953 --> 01:11:46.069
The gut-and-eyes move.

01:11:55.033 --> 01:11:57.308
That's where they went splat.
Just dropped them.

01:11:57.513 --> 01:11:58.582
I'm bad.

01:11:58.953 --> 01:12:02.741
I'll rip your lips off and
kiss my ass with them shits.

01:12:02.953 --> 01:12:03.908
I seen him do it.

01:12:04.113 --> 01:12:05.592
I do that.
That's how I get down.

01:12:05.793 --> 01:12:08.830
I'll rip your tongue out
and lick my balls with them.

01:12:09.033 --> 01:12:10.148
Shut up.

01:12:10.633 --> 01:12:11.588
Check him out.

01:12:13.113 --> 01:12:14.990
Francois, you search him.

01:12:15.793 --> 01:12:17.511
-We're moving in.
-No, wait.

01:12:17.833 --> 01:12:20.188
This must be a part of his plan.

01:12:20.393 --> 01:12:22.782
What plan?
He's unarmed and outnumbered.

01:12:22.993 --> 01:12:25.587
Trust me.
You should see Malone's résumé.

01:12:26.713 --> 01:12:28.988
This is like a walk in the park for him.

01:12:29.593 --> 01:12:31.265
I must tell you, Pete.

01:12:32.033 --> 01:12:33.625
You look the part...

01:12:34.113 --> 01:12:35.990
...you certainly talk the talk...

01:12:37.553 --> 01:12:39.828
...but you still stink like a cop.

01:12:40.913 --> 01:12:42.665
Damn it!
I knew he would catch us, man.

01:12:42.873 --> 01:12:44.511
Shut up! That's bullshit.

01:12:44.753 --> 01:12:48.348
Come on, man. Just talk to him.
We might get out of here!

01:12:49.233 --> 01:12:50.586
See? He's lying!

01:12:50.793 --> 01:12:54.786
If I was a cop, would I have busted
his shit? That's bleeding!

01:12:54.993 --> 01:12:56.108
Lock him in the car.

01:12:56.633 --> 01:12:57.748
Get him out of here.

01:12:57.953 --> 01:12:58.863
If I was a cop--

01:12:59.233 --> 01:13:00.268
Shut up!

01:13:02.353 --> 01:13:03.945
My nose bleeding!

01:13:04.233 --> 01:13:05.382
Damn!

01:13:05.953 --> 01:13:07.102
You better tell us the truth.

01:13:08.513 --> 01:13:09.992
He's a cop.

01:13:10.633 --> 01:13:12.863
He hijacked the truck. This is a setup.

01:13:13.073 --> 01:13:16.065
If I was a cop, FBls would be
in here right now, man...

01:13:16.273 --> 01:13:17.672
...taking everybody to jail!

01:13:19.113 --> 01:13:20.432
I think...

01:13:20.953 --> 01:13:22.545
...l have an idea.

01:13:28.913 --> 01:13:30.665
You wanna prove you aren't a cop?

01:13:33.433 --> 01:13:34.343
You say he's lying.

01:13:35.913 --> 01:13:36.868
Damn right.

01:13:37.073 --> 01:13:38.222
Shoot him.

01:13:39.433 --> 01:13:40.832
Shoot him.

01:13:41.393 --> 01:13:42.348
No problem.

01:13:44.713 --> 01:13:45.509
You son of a bitch!

01:13:45.713 --> 01:13:47.112
I meant, kill him.

01:13:48.633 --> 01:13:51.386
You didn't say that.
You just said, "Shoot him."

01:13:52.633 --> 01:13:54.430
You wanna prove you aren't a cop?

01:13:55.753 --> 01:13:57.152
Kill him.

01:14:00.433 --> 01:14:02.389
There ain't no coming back for him.

01:14:12.633 --> 01:14:15.306
That's it. We're moving in.
All units, move in.

01:14:16.233 --> 01:14:17.029
Let's go!

01:14:41.513 --> 01:14:42.309
Shit!

01:14:47.433 --> 01:14:49.901
Give me the diamond or
I'll pop one in your ass!

01:14:50.113 --> 01:14:51.307
You had your chance.

01:15:01.353 --> 01:15:02.422
Freeze! LAPD!

01:15:02.633 --> 01:15:04.146
Show me your hands!

01:15:09.153 --> 01:15:09.949
Nice shot.

01:15:14.153 --> 01:15:16.269
Get out of the car! Turn around!

01:15:25.153 --> 01:15:25.949
Shit!

01:16:05.953 --> 01:16:07.750
All units, this is Agent Gray, FBl.

01:16:07.953 --> 01:16:10.865
We have no authority to pursue
the suspect beyond our border.

01:16:11.193 --> 01:16:13.024
Do not cross into Mexico!

01:16:33.353 --> 01:16:37.505
Pursuit of suspect heading southbound.
We have an undercover officer onboard.

01:16:37.713 --> 01:16:40.307
I repeat: We have
a friendly onboard. Over!

01:16:40.513 --> 01:16:41.423
Roger that!

01:16:50.713 --> 01:16:51.828
Hold on!

01:17:08.113 --> 01:17:09.307
Shit!

01:18:01.593 --> 01:18:02.946
Look out!

01:18:15.033 --> 01:18:17.024
Get him! I'm glad to see y'all!

01:18:17.633 --> 01:18:19.191
What you waiting for? Go!

01:18:19.393 --> 01:18:21.702
We can't, Malone.
We have no jurisdiction.

01:18:21.913 --> 01:18:24.268
Damn that! Damn the jurisdiction!
Go! Now!

01:18:24.473 --> 01:18:26.703
We cannot cross into Mexico.

01:18:27.033 --> 01:18:27.829
-You can't?
-No.

01:18:28.033 --> 01:18:28.943
-You can't?
-No!

01:18:29.153 --> 01:18:30.381
Watch me.

01:18:31.833 --> 01:18:32.629
Believe that!

01:18:33.913 --> 01:18:35.551
Move your ass!

01:18:59.553 --> 01:19:01.032
Damn it! One bullet.

01:19:11.913 --> 01:19:12.868
Come on, Miles!

01:19:18.873 --> 01:19:19.669
Shit!

01:19:53.713 --> 01:19:56.432
-You're under arrest.
-What are you doing?

01:19:56.633 --> 01:19:58.908
I'm arresting you before they get here.

01:19:59.113 --> 01:20:01.229
I'll blow your head off
before they get here.

01:20:02.553 --> 01:20:05.306
The way I see it
is you got 30 seconds...

01:20:05.513 --> 01:20:07.788
...before they make
a pinata out of you.

01:20:07.993 --> 01:20:09.187
What are they talking about?

01:20:10.313 --> 01:20:12.543
Malone is an expert negotiator.

01:20:12.753 --> 01:20:13.902
He's an expert, sir.

01:20:15.233 --> 01:20:16.586
You got two choices.

01:20:16.913 --> 01:20:18.949
You can wind up somebody's bitch...

01:20:19.313 --> 01:20:20.792
...or somebody's senorita.

01:20:20.993 --> 01:20:22.711
Make up your mind. Your choice.

01:20:22.993 --> 01:20:25.826
I got three choices.
Maybe I just tell them who you are.

01:20:26.033 --> 01:20:29.787
You'll shut your mouth. Maybe
I'll cut you in on the diamond.

01:20:30.193 --> 01:20:33.902
Shithead, I got the goddamn diamond.

01:20:34.113 --> 01:20:36.069
Let me get that.
I'm your only way out!

01:20:36.793 --> 01:20:38.192
Now, give me the gun.

01:20:38.433 --> 01:20:40.025
You don't wanna go to jail
in Mexico.

01:20:40.233 --> 01:20:44.306
Nobody wanna go to jail in Mexico.
They put burritos in your ass.

01:20:44.513 --> 01:20:45.389
Shut up!

01:20:45.593 --> 01:20:48.391
Come on, Deke. Give me the gun.
Come on!

01:20:48.593 --> 01:20:52.381
They think I'm a cop!
They think I'm a cop, man!

01:20:52.633 --> 01:20:54.510
I can help you, okay?

01:20:54.753 --> 01:20:57.551
You don't wanna die here.
Now give that up.

01:20:57.753 --> 01:21:00.631
If you screw me, I swear to God,
I'll come back for you.

01:21:00.833 --> 01:21:02.425
I'll come back for you!

01:21:02.713 --> 01:21:03.748
Give me the gun!

01:21:06.233 --> 01:21:08.542
There you go.
Let me get that from you.

01:21:08.913 --> 01:21:10.790
Come on. Let it go.

01:21:14.953 --> 01:21:16.705
There you go.

01:21:22.353 --> 01:21:23.786
This is gonna hurt a bit.

01:21:26.393 --> 01:21:27.428
Holy Christ!

01:21:31.233 --> 01:21:32.109
That's for Eddie.

01:21:37.753 --> 01:21:39.152
You son of a bitch!

01:21:39.353 --> 01:21:40.752
Come back here!

01:21:41.033 --> 01:21:42.102
You son of a bitch!

01:21:42.953 --> 01:21:44.227
Miles, you die!

01:22:17.553 --> 01:22:18.781
You all right?

01:22:19.633 --> 01:22:21.908
I needed a vacation anyway, right?

01:22:23.553 --> 01:22:26.147
The FBI needs to talk to you,
Detective Malone.

01:22:30.353 --> 01:22:33.902
Peterson, regional director, FBl.
We need to talk.

01:22:34.113 --> 01:22:36.149
Wait a minute. Slow down.

01:22:36.353 --> 01:22:38.150
No, lieutenant, I will not slow down.

01:22:38.433 --> 01:22:40.469
Is this man one of yours...

01:22:41.233 --> 01:22:42.552
...or not?

01:22:44.313 --> 01:22:45.792
You bet your ass he is.

01:22:46.633 --> 01:22:49.352
Well, I'm gonna find out
what happened here...

01:22:49.713 --> 01:22:54.628
...even if it means putting your entire
department under federal review.

01:22:57.033 --> 01:22:58.591
Nice work.

01:23:04.033 --> 01:23:08.185
My office spent an hour talking to West
Covina and the U.S. Attorney's Office...

01:23:08.393 --> 01:23:11.032
...trying to find out just
who it is you're working for.

01:23:11.233 --> 01:23:13.542
Now we know it's not the Bureau.

01:23:13.753 --> 01:23:15.823
It's time that you
gave us an explanation.

01:23:20.793 --> 01:23:22.226
I'm a federale.

01:23:22.433 --> 01:23:23.229
A federale?

01:23:24.553 --> 01:23:26.987
Look across that border.
What do you see?

01:23:27.233 --> 01:23:30.384
That is the Democratic
Republic of Mexico.

01:23:30.593 --> 01:23:31.389
You're Mexican?

01:23:31.593 --> 01:23:34.027
That's right.
On my mother's father's side.

01:23:34.233 --> 01:23:35.188
I can see it.

01:23:35.393 --> 01:23:36.621
Glacias. Thank you.

01:23:36.833 --> 01:23:39.142
Gentlemen, I shouldn't be
telling y'all this.

01:23:39.353 --> 01:23:40.832
I could lose my federale-hood.

01:23:41.033 --> 01:23:41.829
Your what?

01:23:42.033 --> 01:23:43.386
My federale-hood!

01:23:44.633 --> 01:23:46.669
Look, I had to throw you guys off, okay?

01:23:46.953 --> 01:23:48.705
I was doing it for my country.

01:23:48.913 --> 01:23:50.187
The red...

01:23:50.713 --> 01:23:51.987
...the white...

01:23:52.793 --> 01:23:53.782
...and the green.

01:23:55.233 --> 01:23:58.225
If you'll excuse me,
I have to cross this border...

01:23:58.433 --> 01:24:01.425
...and school some of my compadres,
you know...

01:24:01.633 --> 01:24:05.148
...on things we like to talk about.
So y'all stay up. Be cool.

01:24:13.113 --> 01:24:16.662
What's happening?
Hook a brother up with a taco!

01:24:16.873 --> 01:24:18.386
A burrito!

01:24:22.033 --> 01:24:26.151
I can't believe so much bad shit
can happen on such a beautiful day.

01:24:30.633 --> 01:24:32.146
Yeah, what?

01:24:32.553 --> 01:24:34.225
I think your Spanish is a little rusty.

01:24:34.433 --> 01:24:37.743
You just told those men
you got a big cat in your pants.

01:24:41.433 --> 01:24:44.630
That's a Latin thing. Macho.
You wouldn't understand.

01:24:45.313 --> 01:24:47.668
No, I think I do understand...

01:24:50.513 --> 01:24:51.423
...Logan.

01:24:51.713 --> 01:24:52.509
What?

01:24:55.593 --> 01:24:56.912
How'd you know it was me?

01:24:57.113 --> 01:24:58.944
I started thinking if I was Logan...

01:24:59.153 --> 01:25:03.351
...and had my diamond hidden
in a police building, what would I do?

01:25:03.713 --> 01:25:05.226
So I thought like a crook.

01:25:05.553 --> 01:25:07.032
Is that right?

01:25:07.753 --> 01:25:08.868
I don't believe this.

01:25:09.073 --> 01:25:10.950
He's a major felon.

01:25:11.273 --> 01:25:13.662
This is one hell of a bust, Carlson.

01:25:14.713 --> 01:25:16.943
It's a hell of a bust for us.

01:25:18.953 --> 01:25:20.625
It's just too bad we can't make it.

01:25:21.313 --> 01:25:22.541
Say what?

01:25:22.833 --> 01:25:25.028
You heard the FBl.
They're extremely strict...

01:25:25.233 --> 01:25:28.862
...about pursuing suspects
across international borders.

01:25:29.713 --> 01:25:31.943
And you're just out of our jurisdiction.

01:25:36.393 --> 01:25:37.462
You're...?

01:25:38.353 --> 01:25:39.945
Exactly, because I'm across the--

01:25:40.153 --> 01:25:43.509
If I'm across the border and you're
over there, there's no way you--

01:25:47.393 --> 01:25:49.304
I love this jurisdiction shit!

01:25:52.033 --> 01:25:54.786
I guess this is the last time
I'm gonna see you boys.

01:25:56.033 --> 01:25:58.467
But maybe we'll catch you later.

01:25:58.833 --> 01:25:59.629
Is it like that?

01:25:59.993 --> 01:26:01.392
Yeah. It's like that.

01:26:12.033 --> 01:26:14.149
Right there. Jurisdiction.

01:26:17.553 --> 01:26:18.429
Thanks.

01:26:21.633 --> 01:26:23.385
Viva Las Mexico...

01:26:23.593 --> 01:26:24.946
...and I'm out!
