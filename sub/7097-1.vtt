03:23.579 --> 03:26.039
Go around back. Look out.

03:51.313 --> 03:53.773
You sons of bitches!

04:00.863 --> 04:03.866
Your lucky day, man!

04:05.242 --> 04:09.913
Give me the money, home boy.
Give me the money now.

04:10.038 --> 04:14.667
It's collection time, Charley.
Collection time.

04:46.363 --> 04:48.490
Get up, you motherfucker!

04:48.657 --> 04:52.952
- You old piece of shit!
- Stay awake while we're killing this guy.

04:53.953 --> 04:57.457
I pulled out
and you went straight into my car.

04:57.582 --> 05:01.335
- Cabbie, 20 buck s, you get us outta here.
- Thanks.

05:27.317 --> 05:29.403
I'm gonna call the police.

06:08.730 --> 06:10.148
Charley?

06:20.032 --> 06:24.411
Hey, Charley.
Jeez, Charley, what happened?

06:24.536 --> 06:29.332
Paul... take care of my things, will you?

06:29.458 --> 06:32.168
Till I get... back.

06:34.921 --> 06:37.590
Move and you're dead, asshole!

06:38.883 --> 06:42.428
He's dead. The son of a bitch killed him.

06:42.553 --> 06:45.347
- Get him outta here!
- Come on, let's go.

06:45.472 --> 06:47.766
Come on. Move it!

06:50.185 --> 06:52.479
Get in there.

07:03.113 --> 07:07.367
Come on, you did it. We know you did it.
You know we know.

07:08.869 --> 07:10.996
No bruises, see.

07:11.121 --> 07:14.249
You want a glass of water? Huh?

07:14.374 --> 07:18.377
- You can't have it.
- Not till you tell us what we wanna know.

07:18.503 --> 07:20.796
- Chief.
- Who's this dude?

07:20.921 --> 07:23.382
Mr. Kimble doesn't wanna talk.

07:26.593 --> 07:28.679
Leave.

07:30.764 --> 07:32.891
Kimble, is it?

07:34.642 --> 07:37.353
Son of a bitch.

07:37.478 --> 07:40.106
I'll be a son of a bitch.

07:41.440 --> 07:44.234
It's not Kimble.

07:44.360 --> 07:47.196
I know you. Kersey.

07:47.321 --> 07:49.406
It's Paul Kersey.

07:49.531 --> 07:55.662
I was with the New York PD when they
brought a vigilante in with a bullet in his leg.

07:55.787 --> 07:57.872
You were out like a light.

07:57.997 --> 08:02.001
It's been ten years. Mr. Vigilante.

08:03.460 --> 08:07.172
Last damn thing I need is a vigilante.

08:07.297 --> 08:11.885
You're in big trouble. What were you doing
in East New York on Belmont?

08:12.010 --> 08:14.345
I was visiting a friend.

08:15.597 --> 08:18.015
Maybe you did it.

08:20.142 --> 08:24.396
- Probably not.
- I found him that way.

08:24.521 --> 08:27.649
And I'm no more Mr. Vigilante.

08:29.234 --> 08:31.486
What do I do with you, dude?

08:31.611 --> 08:35.907
- I don't know, but I want a lawyer.
- No, you don't.

08:39.202 --> 08:42.453
Roaches. I hate 'em.

08:42.580 --> 08:47.000
Maybe I should have you killed.
Who's gonna complain?

08:47.125 --> 08:51.046
Do you always violate
people's constitutional rights?

08:51.213 --> 08:54.549
This is my jail, Kersey, and I'm the law.

08:54.674 --> 08:57.802
So I get to violate your constitutional rights.

09:02.890 --> 09:06.059
- Son of a bitch!
- Cooler!

09:07.644 --> 09:10.063
- Come on!
- Watch it.

09:10.188 --> 09:12.482
And forget bail!

09:12.607 --> 09:15.944
Watch him! Make sure
he doesn't get comfortable!

09:16.069 --> 09:18.613
Hey, Chief, you all right?

09:53.103 --> 09:55.271
Get in there.

09:58.274 --> 10:00.693
Looking for trouble, man?

10:07.366 --> 10:09.534
You fucker!

10:23.214 --> 10:25.924
I tore it out.

10:32.138 --> 10:36.559
- You bastard! Fucker!
- Look at him sitting between two bars.

10:36.684 --> 10:39.770
That fat motherfucker deserved what he got!

10:45.943 --> 10:48.737
Talk about getting shit-faced!

10:48.862 --> 10:51.239
It's great. Look at that.

11:17.805 --> 11:20.182
Hey, Vito, coffee.

11:30.942 --> 11:34.529
I wanna move on that one in the corner.

11:46.540 --> 11:48.667
Kill the fucker!

11:54.756 --> 11:57.383
Hey, man, I always win.

12:05.182 --> 12:07.434
Come on!

12:09.561 --> 12:12.063
Come on, you! Come on!

12:21.238 --> 12:23.449
Get in there!

12:26.243 --> 12:30.747
Fraker, you're being released. Five minutes.

12:30.872 --> 12:33.625
See? I got a lawyer.

12:34.542 --> 12:40.798
But I gotta tell you... If they hadn't
broken us up, I would've killed you.

12:40.881 --> 12:44.677
Next time... you won't even see me coming.

12:53.643 --> 12:57.855
Tell you what, I'm gonna kill
a little old lady. Just for you.

12:57.980 --> 13:01.442
Catch it on the six o'clock news.

13:02.693 --> 13:07.739
You got some free time, come up
to Sutter and Belmont. That's my turf.

13:07.864 --> 13:10.367
So long, asshole.

13:14.329 --> 13:18.916
It's gonna take them a couple of hours
to put the papers through.

13:19.041 --> 13:22.044
Two more hours in this fucking pit!

13:24.630 --> 13:27.507
Sure. Whatever you say.

13:33.304 --> 13:38.309
Shriker! Inspector Shriker, what are
you doing with this prisoner, Kimble?

13:38.434 --> 13:42.021
- Keeping him in jail.
- What's the bail?

13:42.104 --> 13:44.857
- There is no bail.
- What are the charges?

13:44.982 --> 13:48.276
- There are no charges.
- Are you out of your mind?

13:48.402 --> 13:53.239
You're violating all his rights.
What the hell do you think you're doing?

13:54.324 --> 13:59.036
- He'll sue. He's got a case, you know.
- Not likely.

13:59.161 --> 14:03.624
Who is Kimble?
You're gonna have to let him out.

14:05.751 --> 14:08.628
Stay out of this one, Miss Davis.

14:10.213 --> 14:15.385
Three murders. Four rapes. Eight muggings.
Nine acts of random violence.

14:15.510 --> 14:20.473
The most orderly drug traffic.
More robberies than I care to mention.

14:20.598 --> 14:23.267
Broken store windows. Firebombings.

14:23.392 --> 14:27.354
All within a six-square-block area
of Sutter and Belmont.

14:27.479 --> 14:31.900
I could qualify that as a riot.
This isn't a neighborhood, it's a war.

14:32.025 --> 14:35.486
What are we doing about that,
Captain Sterns?

14:35.612 --> 14:37.697
We know it's gang-related.

14:37.822 --> 14:42.701
We put more uniformed officers out,
more cars on patrol.

14:42.826 --> 14:46.163
We increased our real effort 15 per cent.

14:46.288 --> 14:49.291
Tell us the results.

14:49.416 --> 14:53.586
Reported crime is up 11 per cent.

14:57.882 --> 15:00.801
Let's you and I have a talk.

15:04.596 --> 15:07.349
Leave him with me.

15:09.351 --> 15:12.520
So, how you feeling, Kersey? Smoke?

15:15.440 --> 15:17.900
Where have you been recently?

15:18.067 --> 15:20.986
In the country, having a rest.

15:21.153 --> 15:25.407
You see, Kersey... I admire you.

15:26.783 --> 15:29.911
I'm a real fan. Even kept a folder on you.

15:30.829 --> 15:33.498
Truth is, I hate creeps, too.

15:33.623 --> 15:37.126
But I can't do much about it. I'm a cop.

15:38.461 --> 15:41.797
But you... You shoot 'em, right?

15:44.967 --> 15:47.094
I have a theory.

15:48.053 --> 15:50.430
If I'm right,

15:50.597 --> 15:53.475
you turned pro after LA.

15:53.600 --> 15:56.394
Six creeps shot in 36 hours.

15:58.187 --> 16:03.901
Then four gang members in Kansas City.
Two mugger-rapists in Chicago.

16:04.068 --> 16:07.613
Like I said, I'm through with all that.

16:07.738 --> 16:10.907
Really? Then why are you here?

16:11.032 --> 16:14.786
Well, it's a great city. I missed it.

16:14.911 --> 16:19.874
All right. You want something
in this burg, have it.

16:20.666 --> 16:22.751
It's on me.

16:22.877 --> 16:25.671
You want outta here, you got it.

16:25.796 --> 16:31.551
I'll minimize the vigilante stuff
with the press, say it's creeps killing creeps.

16:31.676 --> 16:34.637
It'll be just like before, Mr. Vigilante.

16:34.762 --> 16:40.434
With one important difference.
You're gonna work for me.

16:40.601 --> 16:44.855
Do your thing. But report to me,
tell me what's going on.

16:44.980 --> 16:49.693
Tell me everything you're even thinking
of doing. Let us get some busts.

16:49.860 --> 16:54.364
It's that or I'll keep you here
till hell freezes over.

16:55.531 --> 16:58.242
Do we understand each other?

16:59.744 --> 17:01.871
You in?

17:01.996 --> 17:06.959
Cross me and I'll bury you
so deep they'll never find the bones.

17:09.795 --> 17:14.464
- You're letting me loose?
- I'm letting you loose.

17:20.179 --> 17:25.309
- What about the gun?
- I didn't see any report of a gun. Did you?

17:25.476 --> 17:30.564
If there was a gun, I'd have to charge you
with possessing a firearm. They're illegal.

17:34.901 --> 17:38.696
He's free to go.
He's gotta see the public defender.

17:38.863 --> 17:42.575
Davis, the public defender,
is arranging your release.

17:42.700 --> 17:45.911
It's gonna take a while.
Sit out there and wait.

17:50.332 --> 17:54.794
Kimble... Watch it,
there's a new breed on the streets.

18:08.015 --> 18:10.684
Quiet now. I'm not here.

18:15.730 --> 18:20.318
Is this the night's haul, Chaco?
Pretty good. Very good.

18:21.610 --> 18:24.238
- Good, Chaco.
- Hector, are you allowed?

18:24.363 --> 18:27.574
I'll tell you what to do and when.

18:30.494 --> 18:33.496
We didn't think we'd see you out so soon.

18:38.251 --> 18:43.255
Hey, man, it's good to see you!
Just been taking care of a little business.

18:43.380 --> 18:46.175
- I can see that.
- You said I should...

18:46.300 --> 18:48.093
Did I?

18:49.928 --> 18:52.847
This is a sticker, Hector.

18:52.972 --> 18:55.225
- And you're the stickee.
- No!

19:00.146 --> 19:03.691
Aren't you gonna welcome me back?

19:07.611 --> 19:11.323
Mr. Kimble? Kathryn Davis,
Public Defender's Office.

19:11.448 --> 19:15.285
- You're being released now.
- Thanks, Miss Davis.

19:16.577 --> 19:19.163
- You're just going to walk away?
- Yup.

19:19.288 --> 19:24.084
- You have cause to press charges. Sue.
- Miss Davis, it's all right.

19:24.209 --> 19:27.129
- You don't wanna do anything?
- No.

19:27.421 --> 19:29.965
- I don't understand.
- Goodbye.

19:30.132 --> 19:33.885
- Here's my number, just in case.
- Thanks.

19:34.052 --> 19:39.599
Is there someplace I can get hold of you?
I need something for the release form.

20:27.351 --> 20:31.521
Bitch, come here, I wanna eat you.
I wanna lick you all over.

20:32.856 --> 20:36.734
I'm coming for you, bitch.
Come here, I wanna eat you.

20:36.859 --> 20:38.778
Come on, bitch.

20:39.445 --> 20:42.656
Come on! Come on, bitch! Come on.

20:44.074 --> 20:47.661
Come on, stop the car. Come on, bitch!

20:47.786 --> 20:49.788
Stop the car.

20:52.540 --> 20:55.543
Bitch, I'm gonna fucking kill you!

21:10.307 --> 21:11.850
Hey!

21:11.975 --> 21:14.018
Be right down.

21:24.528 --> 21:28.532
- Who are you?
- I was Charley's friend.

21:28.657 --> 21:30.742
Me, too.

21:30.867 --> 21:33.620
- You must be Paul.
- Yeah.

21:33.745 --> 21:37.832
I'm Bennett.
Charley spoke about you all the time.

21:37.957 --> 21:41.836
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah. Come on up.

21:46.298 --> 21:51.094
They broke that yesterday.
Well, it's the neighborhood.

21:51.219 --> 21:55.640
And you missed the funeral.
It was nice, as far as funerals go.

21:58.184 --> 22:01.896
That's Charley and me in World War II.

22:02.062 --> 22:05.816
I knew Charley 40 years.

22:07.150 --> 22:09.903
He met you during the Korean War?

22:10.028 --> 22:14.157
Yeah. I was a conscientious objector.

22:15.241 --> 22:19.328
He didn't agree with that.
But we got along all right.

22:19.495 --> 22:22.581
In fact, we got to be very good friends.

22:22.706 --> 22:27.002
Kept in touch with one another
over the years.

22:27.127 --> 22:32.340
We lived a few blocks from here.
When my wife died, I moved over here.

22:32.507 --> 22:36.344
This was a good neighborhood
until it changed.

22:36.469 --> 22:41.515
I got a letter from Charley a few days ago.
He was really scared.

22:41.640 --> 22:46.770
- They didn't like him, so they killed him.
- Who killed Charley?

22:46.937 --> 22:51.107
The creeps on the street.
He wouldn't take their lip or pay them.

22:51.233 --> 22:54.652
He said he was gonna
do something about it.

22:54.777 --> 22:57.530
Pay? Like in protection?

22:57.655 --> 23:01.826
Protection, robbery, theft.
Your money or your life.

23:01.951 --> 23:04.703
They hit the old people up here.

23:04.828 --> 23:08.415
What goes on out there is a disgrace.

23:08.540 --> 23:11.626
Now wait a minute. Who killed Charley?

23:11.751 --> 23:14.170
I'll show you.

23:14.295 --> 23:19.467
Those three. I saw them running away
when Charley got killed.

23:20.468 --> 23:25.264
- Their faces are painted.
- They belong to the same gang.

23:25.389 --> 23:29.267
We got hell here. You see, it's their turf.

23:30.310 --> 23:33.563
- See him?
- Yeah.

23:33.688 --> 23:36.232
What about him?

23:36.357 --> 23:39.694
He runs the gang. He's the worst.

23:41.862 --> 23:45.240
He's been away. I don't know where.

23:47.034 --> 23:51.871
Looks like you could just go up
and smash him in the face, doesn't it?

23:51.997 --> 23:54.124
Well, it can't be done.

23:54.249 --> 23:56.584
What do you mean?

23:57.502 --> 24:01.881
He's got guys watching him.
I saw a guy try to reach him once.

24:02.006 --> 24:05.634
They chopped him to pieces
before he got six feet.

24:05.759 --> 24:08.679
Is it worth living here like this?

24:08.804 --> 24:11.806
You mean move?

24:13.767 --> 24:16.394
Everybody who can, has.

24:16.519 --> 24:19.647
Me, I got nowhere to go.

24:19.814 --> 24:25.652
I fix clocks, meters for the cab company.
I got a little place down the street.

24:25.778 --> 24:27.863
It's what I do.

24:30.031 --> 24:33.660
I'm not gonna get run outta here.

24:34.702 --> 24:37.497
Are you going back where you came from?

24:37.622 --> 24:43.794
Bennett... when I got to Charley's
apartment, he was still alive.

24:43.919 --> 24:47.756
- Did he say anything?
- Yeah, he said,

24:47.881 --> 24:51.551
"Take care of my things until I get back. "

24:53.887 --> 24:57.056
I've got the keys to his apartment.

24:57.181 --> 25:00.726
The rent is paid till the end of the month.

25:08.066 --> 25:14.072
They've cleaned up and are through
with their investigation. Cops don't care.

25:14.739 --> 25:19.243
- Well?
- Like you said, the rent's paid.

25:19.368 --> 25:21.996
Good night. See you in the morning.

25:23.330 --> 25:25.582
Lock your door.

25:54.859 --> 25:57.111
Bitch, get over here now!

26:15.753 --> 26:18.297
The Giggler, that's his name.

26:18.422 --> 26:22.384
He laughs when he runs.
Nobody catches him.

26:22.510 --> 26:26.430
- Jesus. He really moves.
- Yeah.

26:26.555 --> 26:29.224
Tell me about him.

26:29.349 --> 26:35.730
Well, he killed a girl last month.
Put a knife in her skull doing that.

26:35.855 --> 26:39.358
- How do you know it was him?
- It was him.

26:41.819 --> 26:46.990
Bennett said we can ask. Were you
downstairs last night in the garage?

26:47.115 --> 26:49.326
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

26:49.451 --> 26:52.370
- For what?
- My wife, Maria.

26:52.495 --> 26:55.540
- She was in the car. You helped her?
- Yeah.

26:55.665 --> 27:01.170
I'm Rodriguez. We live downstairs.
You were a friend of Charley's?

27:01.295 --> 27:03.756
- Yeah.
- You're a man who doesn't run.

27:03.881 --> 27:06.884
If there's anything I can do to help, huh?

27:07.009 --> 27:12.555
- What about the cops? They do anything?
- Yeah. They enforce the parking laws.

27:15.892 --> 27:17.727
Yes. Thank you.

27:17.852 --> 27:23.023
Well, my friend Wildey's coming.
He'll help out.

27:23.148 --> 27:25.359
- Who's Wildey?
- You'll see.

27:25.526 --> 27:27.736
Where are you going?

27:27.861 --> 27:32.032
You just take it easy, Bennett.
This is my problem.

27:42.791 --> 27:46.128
I'd like to rent a box for a month.

27:46.253 --> 27:48.338
B21.

27:58.806 --> 28:02.101
OK, this is all right.

28:02.268 --> 28:05.896
- How are you gonna pay for it?
- Cash.

28:11.484 --> 28:17.073
- What's that for? The new car.
- That's bait.

28:18.699 --> 28:24.538
Coming through the lobby, I smelled
something cooking. It smelled great.

28:24.705 --> 28:27.874
It was probably coming from
the Kaprovs' apartment.

28:28.000 --> 28:31.586
- Kaprovs?
- Yeah. I'll introduce you. Come on.

28:31.753 --> 28:35.506
These are the Kaprovs. This is Eli, Erica.

28:35.632 --> 28:40.928
This is Mr. Kersey. He's now in apartment
2C. He was admiring your dinner.

28:41.053 --> 28:44.264
- Stuffed cabbage.
- Smells wonderful.

28:44.390 --> 28:47.267
- Would you like to join us?
- Sure.

28:47.392 --> 28:50.812
- Can I have a few minutes to clean up?
- Certainly.

28:50.937 --> 28:53.273
I'll be right back.

28:55.483 --> 28:56.776
Nice man.

29:11.790 --> 29:15.918
My sister said,
"Know him? I married him in 1931."

29:19.839 --> 29:23.300
Come on!
Let's get the fucking car open!

29:26.470 --> 29:28.889
Excuse me, please.

29:44.069 --> 29:48.532
- Hey. What's the problem?
- What?

29:48.657 --> 29:53.578
- With the car. What's the problem?
- Get outta my fucking face.

29:53.703 --> 29:56.873
We're stealing a fucking car.
What's it to you?

29:56.998 --> 29:59.792
It's my car.

30:00.584 --> 30:02.920
Now you gonna die.

30:12.762 --> 30:17.517
- We heard shots. What happened?
- I sent them a message.

30:35.408 --> 30:38.286
- You're outta your area.
- This is our turf!

30:38.411 --> 30:40.371
Hurt him.

30:47.794 --> 30:49.880
Kill him.

31:06.145 --> 31:12.067
Gentlemen, the streets are full
of degenerates killing each other.

31:12.192 --> 31:14.360
Arrest them.

31:15.194 --> 31:18.990
- Your guys aren't pussies, are they?
- Chief?

31:19.156 --> 31:22.826
I want some arrests.
And bodies on slabs in the morgue.

31:22.952 --> 31:27.914
They can be your guys' bodies
or some of that trash. Get that?

31:33.002 --> 31:36.631
Hey. What the fuck are you looking at?

31:38.049 --> 31:41.093
Hey, lend me five dollars, man.

31:42.219 --> 31:45.764
Hey, I said lend me five dollars! Sucker!

31:50.894 --> 31:53.229
- No!
- Hey!

32:01.987 --> 32:04.573
Yeah! Right on, man!

32:04.698 --> 32:09.077
- You all right?
- Yeah. Thanks, huh? You all right?

32:10.245 --> 32:12.747
Who is this man? We need him.

32:12.872 --> 32:15.541
Emil, Mr. Kersey. Our new neighbor in 2C.

32:15.667 --> 32:19.962
I'm very pleased to meet you.
Oh, this is my wife, Magda.

32:20.087 --> 32:23.799
- Nice to meet you.
- That's him. The man in black.

32:23.924 --> 32:27.594
He's on my turf. I'll take care of him.

32:43.192 --> 32:46.612
- Yes?
- You Charley's friend? Guy in 2C?

32:46.737 --> 32:49.030
Yes.

32:49.156 --> 32:54.744
- What are you doing in there?
- I'm taking care of Charley's things.

32:54.869 --> 32:59.957
Charley don't need no help.
He's dead. Just like you're gonna be.

33:00.124 --> 33:02.877
I'm watching you.

34:04.850 --> 34:11.022
- What do you think of the neighborhood?
- You said I was to be here on my own.

34:11.147 --> 34:14.317
You're right. I think I said that.

34:14.484 --> 34:17.070
Look... I'd like something.

34:18.029 --> 34:21.364
For the papers. You give me a bust.

34:21.489 --> 34:25.536
I'll send in a tactical squad,
they'll grab a headline.

34:25.744 --> 34:28.621
- What do you say?
- Can't help you.

34:28.746 --> 34:32.375
- Nothing happening, huh?
- I don't know anything.

34:32.500 --> 34:36.004
- Look, Kersey...
- Oh, I do know one thing.

34:36.129 --> 34:40.424
Fraker is the chief creep here.
Why don't you bust him?

34:40.549 --> 34:44.636
He's got a cleaner arrest record than you.
Perfect citizen.

34:44.762 --> 34:48.014
When he does something,
he does it privately.

34:48.181 --> 34:51.351
Like I said, I can't help you.

35:11.369 --> 35:13.872
Somebody's gonna get him.

35:13.997 --> 35:18.042
- Shit, man, I'm hurt.
- Son of a bitch!

35:18.584 --> 35:20.711
What is this, man?

35:20.795 --> 35:24.506
We gotta turn the screws
on the motherfuckers.

35:27.968 --> 35:30.053
- Give me some money.
- What for?

35:30.178 --> 35:34.224
- Protection from the creeps.
- You're the creep!

35:34.349 --> 35:38.561
- Hey, you!
- Get out of my way! I've had enough.

35:52.866 --> 35:56.703
- What are you doing up here?
- Looking for you.

35:56.828 --> 35:59.288
How did you find me up here?

35:59.413 --> 36:04.460
I decided if I waited to hear from you
I never would. Shriker was no help.

36:04.585 --> 36:09.214
I read the arrest report
and made a calculated guess.

36:09.339 --> 36:12.759
- I was right. You live there, don't you?
- Yeah.

36:12.926 --> 36:17.221
Miss... Davis, I told you,
I'm not gonna file any charges.

36:17.346 --> 36:20.599
- Would you like to have dinner?
- What?

36:20.725 --> 36:24.895
Well, I'm not usually this bold,

36:25.020 --> 36:30.275
taking a taxi to someplace someone
might not be, to ask them out, but...

36:30.400 --> 36:35.905
...why not? How many people do I meet
in my job who I can ask out to dinner?

36:36.030 --> 36:41.160
- You shouldn't be up here. It's not safe.
- Nonsense, I'm a city girl.

36:41.285 --> 36:47.082
Do me a favor. Say yes. So I can
get out of here without being mugged.

36:48.166 --> 36:50.335
OK, all right. When?

36:52.504 --> 36:55.715
- Friday?
- Friday? Friday's good for me.

36:56.799 --> 36:59.010
My place.

37:00.136 --> 37:04.681
I live in a basement.
It's a nice basement.

37:04.807 --> 37:09.186
- What are you doing up here?
- Friend of mine was killed.

37:09.311 --> 37:14.315
- Trying to find out what happened.
- Why? There's nothing you can do.

37:15.108 --> 37:18.194
I'll put it in a book I'm writing.

37:18.319 --> 37:21.530
Look, your meter's running.
I'll see you Friday.

37:21.655 --> 37:24.366
Friday. Thank you.

38:01.192 --> 38:05.904
- You were brandishing a gun.
- What do you mean, "brandishing"?

38:06.863 --> 38:10.867
Some kids tried to come in
my back window. I waved it.

38:10.992 --> 38:13.745
The complaints said you brandished it.

38:13.870 --> 38:18.499
- Complaints? Who?
- That's none of your concern, sir.

38:19.625 --> 38:23.671
Can we have the gun?
Possession is a felony in the city limits.

38:23.796 --> 38:27.132
If you surrender the weapon,
we'll forget it happened.

38:27.257 --> 38:30.218
Otherwise, you go to jail.

38:32.387 --> 38:35.431
Eli, give him the gun.

38:35.556 --> 38:39.602
- Erica, it's our protection.
- Please.

38:43.272 --> 38:45.149
Thanks, mister.

38:55.992 --> 38:59.370
Listen, we'll come in here any time we like.

38:59.495 --> 39:01.789
You got that... Pops?

39:04.041 --> 39:06.251
Any time!

39:12.757 --> 39:15.134
The first floor is the worst.

39:15.260 --> 39:19.138
But they come in wherever they want
from the fire escapes.

39:19.263 --> 39:23.726
It's 90 degrees outside.
And I've had my windows nailed shut.

39:23.851 --> 39:27.521
I'll take care of it.
But I'll need some things first.

39:43.952 --> 39:45.996
This is how it works.

39:46.163 --> 39:48.999
I've put a nail in the window.

39:49.082 --> 39:52.919
Anybody opening the window
raises the nail...

40:01.802 --> 40:05.180
- What are you doing?
- Thinning the herd.

40:08.975 --> 40:12.562
Hey... I wanna make a house call, man.

40:13.688 --> 40:16.899
I'm a little short on cash.

40:17.024 --> 40:21.904
For 20 minutes you play.
Then you all go out to work.

40:22.655 --> 40:26.158
- All right! Get up! Go!
- Come on!

40:26.700 --> 40:30.162
- Mr. Bennett, I know you like a lot.
- Yes, I do.

40:48.553 --> 40:51.014
- What are those?
- Teeth.

40:51.139 --> 40:53.641
APB, theft at 121 Sutter.

40:53.766 --> 40:58.813
Suspect is described as Latino,
five foot six. Missing two front teeth.

41:15.203 --> 41:18.414
You thief! Stop!

41:35.263 --> 41:38.724
This Wildey friend of yours,
can he catch this guy?

41:38.849 --> 41:43.020
- Well, who's Wildey?
- You'll see.

42:00.202 --> 42:02.580
Wildey's here.

42:11.921 --> 42:16.384
Fires a. 475 Wildey Magnum.
Real stopping power.

42:16.509 --> 42:19.136
Is that like a. 44 Magnum?

42:19.262 --> 42:22.014
No, a. 44 Magnum is a pistol cartridge.

42:22.181 --> 42:28.770
A.475 Wildey Magnum is a shorter version
of the African big-game cartridge.

42:30.063 --> 42:32.774
Makes a real mess.

42:52.500 --> 42:55.461
Yeah!

43:00.883 --> 43:06.805
What are you two looking at? What are you,
perverts? Get the fuck outta here!

43:11.226 --> 43:14.437
Open the door!

43:15.313 --> 43:18.816
All right, open the door!

43:18.941 --> 43:21.026
OK.

43:21.152 --> 43:25.781
- No! No!
- Let's go! Come on!

44:07.110 --> 44:10.488
Raped her. They raped her!

44:11.197 --> 44:13.408
Bennett, get a taxi.

44:15.243 --> 44:18.538
- Oh, Maria...
- Thanks.

44:18.663 --> 44:20.998
They say she'll be all right.

44:21.123 --> 44:25.002
Just a broken arm.
I'll take you to the hospital.

44:28.547 --> 44:31.341
It'll all be all right.

44:31.466 --> 44:34.010
Baptist Medical Centre.

44:36.429 --> 44:39.682
Dr. Applebaum
to the Emergency Room.

44:42.017 --> 44:44.645
The doctor is in here.

44:44.770 --> 44:49.816
- Mr. Rodriguez?
- How's my wife? Can I see her?

44:50.901 --> 44:53.695
Mrs. Rodriguez has expired.

44:59.909 --> 45:04.955
Jesus. Over the phone they told me
she had just a broken arm.

45:05.080 --> 45:09.376
The arm was badly injured.
There were broken blood vessels.

45:09.501 --> 45:13.838
Some clots came free and, we think,
lodged in the heart.

45:16.883 --> 45:18.968
I'm sorry.

45:31.021 --> 45:36.317
The light's no good. No ID you make
is gonna stand up in a court.

46:02.466 --> 46:07.638
- You load the shells yourself?
- Nothing's too good for our friends.

46:08.388 --> 46:11.474
The action of this weapon is adjustable.

46:11.641 --> 46:14.727
Depending on the charge and the cartridge.

46:15.687 --> 46:19.815
Think I'll go down the street
and get myself some ice cream.

46:25.696 --> 46:28.240
This is America, isn't it?

46:54.514 --> 46:56.641
Thanks!

47:01.312 --> 47:03.397
What do I owe you?

47:15.074 --> 47:17.952
Look at that fucker with the ice cream.

47:42.516 --> 47:45.894
Somebody got shot. Who was that man?

47:46.019 --> 47:49.731
Oh, my... It's the creep
that stole my pocketbook!

47:49.856 --> 47:53.985
- All right! All right!
- He's dead! Hey!

48:03.744 --> 48:06.455
Right on! Right on!

48:08.707 --> 48:12.002
They killed The Giggler, man.

48:12.168 --> 48:14.587
They killed The Giggler!

48:14.712 --> 48:18.341
They had no business doing that. None.

48:18.466 --> 48:21.594
It's the new man, the one from the jail.

48:22.970 --> 48:26.431
That wasn't smart. No, not too smart.

48:28.183 --> 48:31.645
Come on, you all, let's move it back.
Make way.

48:38.901 --> 48:42.821
Where you been? It's about time.
I'm glad he's dead!

48:42.947 --> 48:47.200
He took my pocketbook three weeks ago!
I'm glad he's dead!

48:47.326 --> 48:49.411
Cops never get here on time!

48:49.536 --> 48:51.621
- Hi, team.
- Hello, Chief.

48:51.746 --> 48:54.541
What have you got here?

48:55.625 --> 48:59.086
There's not much left
of the sucker, is there?

49:01.046 --> 49:05.467
- How are things around here?
- Better. It's getting quiet.

49:05.592 --> 49:08.720
Our efforts must be having a positive effect.

49:08.845 --> 49:13.099
- We're getting fewer complaints.
- Don't let it go to your head.

49:13.224 --> 49:17.311
Looked like a rifle bullet.
The shot came from over there.

49:17.478 --> 49:21.732
- He was a good shot.
- Better than anyone in our department.

49:27.362 --> 49:29.239
- Hello.
- Hello.

49:32.283 --> 49:35.411
The guy at the store said this wine is good.

49:35.536 --> 49:37.747
Great. I'll open it.

49:38.539 --> 49:42.251
I hope you like chicken.
It's the only thing I can make.

49:42.376 --> 49:44.837
Chicken's good. I like chicken.

49:49.799 --> 49:53.636
I have one sister.
She lives in Binghamton, New York.

49:53.761 --> 49:56.222
And I hate her.

49:56.347 --> 50:00.351
But I love sports.
Basketball and football on TV.

50:00.476 --> 50:03.729
- What do you like?
- I like opera.

50:04.605 --> 50:07.649
- Opera?
- It's restful.

50:08.775 --> 50:11.486
I don't know anything about you.

50:11.611 --> 50:14.531
Married? Children?

50:14.656 --> 50:18.951
- I was married, but my wife died.
- I'm sorry.

50:20.786 --> 50:24.957
It's all right. That was years ago.
What about you?

50:25.999 --> 50:32.130
Am I right? I guess that you're afraid
to be close to someone again.

50:32.255 --> 50:34.716
Oh... maybe.

50:37.218 --> 50:40.638
Do you like the kind of work you do?

50:40.763 --> 50:43.390
Most of the time.

50:43.515 --> 50:47.561
No. Sometimes I feel like
I'm on the wrong side.

50:48.353 --> 50:51.439
Defending... creeps.

50:53.024 --> 50:55.526
Don't take that personally.

50:55.652 --> 51:01.824
You're gentle. But I've seen
a lot of gentle people get hurt.

51:02.700 --> 51:08.121
People have got to fight back, and hard!
The whole thing is just out of balance.

51:09.498 --> 51:12.792
Some people would say
that was an extreme position.

51:12.917 --> 51:16.504
I don't care! I bet you never get mad.

51:18.464 --> 51:22.218
I'm sorry. Why am I angry at you?

51:24.636 --> 51:29.641
Tell me. You don't really like opera, do you?

51:31.101 --> 51:33.311
No.

51:34.979 --> 51:38.774
- It's late. I gotta go.
- No, it's early.

51:38.900 --> 51:43.112
Even an unemployed writer has to work.
I really gotta go.

51:45.781 --> 51:48.575
- Well, see you again?
- Yup.

51:57.458 --> 52:00.002
Cuban's gonna get high.

52:02.087 --> 52:04.339
Go ahead, it's speed.

52:06.383 --> 52:09.469
Yeah, Cuban's gonna get high! High! High!

52:09.594 --> 52:13.723
- No needles, man.
- Just snort it.

52:14.641 --> 52:17.685
I don't want you flat on your ass.

52:17.810 --> 52:20.229
Cuban's gonna kill tonight.

53:39.010 --> 53:41.762
Head him off. Get round back.

55:13.555 --> 55:15.640
He's all yours. Go get him.

56:39.050 --> 56:44.263
Police car to Control.
Request ambulance to 763 Belmont.

56:44.346 --> 56:46.557
We have a dead body out front.

56:46.682 --> 56:50.101
Send the meat wagon to 673 Belmont.

56:54.856 --> 56:57.191
Let's talk.

56:59.819 --> 57:04.323
Try and take it easy
for a couple of days, will you?

57:09.411 --> 57:13.623
Coroner's shop
is going out and hiring extra help.

57:15.166 --> 57:18.294
People are starting to get a line on you.

57:19.170 --> 57:22.840
He isn't finished. It isn't finished.

57:22.923 --> 57:27.302
It's like killing roaches.
You have to kill them all.

57:32.557 --> 57:36.602
- Hi. Is this Mr. Emil?
- Yes. Yes.

57:36.728 --> 57:41.273
I think your wife needs your help.
She's sick or something.

57:41.440 --> 57:46.695
- Who is this? What do you mean?
- Hey, you be nice now.

57:46.820 --> 57:50.532
- You better be here, at home.
- Who is this?

57:50.657 --> 57:54.118
You threw one of my boys
outta your store last week.

57:54.244 --> 57:56.579
It's your wife. She's dying.

58:27.190 --> 58:30.569
- Hello?
- See what you've done? You got me mad.

58:31.403 --> 58:33.655
Fuck it.

58:33.780 --> 58:38.242
It's me he wants, you know. How's Emil?

58:38.367 --> 58:41.954
Forget Emil. Emil's done for.

58:42.079 --> 58:45.290
He'll never be the same again.

58:45.415 --> 58:52.464
20 years, nobody ever did a thing
like that to me. Breaking my windows.

58:52.589 --> 58:55.466
Well, I say fuck 'em. I've had it.

58:55.591 --> 58:58.678
Charley said the same thing
and he was right.

58:58.844 --> 59:02.890
He was afraid he was gonna use them.
He should have.

59:03.057 --> 59:05.767
Instead, he gave them to me to keep.

59:05.893 --> 59:09.896
Next time they come,
I've got something for them.

59:10.021 --> 59:12.524
- What?
- I'll show you.

59:20.031 --> 59:22.491
A.30-calibre Browning machine gun.

59:22.616 --> 59:26.286
Charley brought them home from the war.
They still work.

59:26.453 --> 59:28.955
Jesus!

59:31.583 --> 59:34.252
- This ammunition any good?
- Damn right.

59:34.377 --> 59:38.839
You shoot some nice, big holes
in the sons of bitches.

59:38.965 --> 59:43.886
They call us the old people.
We were running the world 20 years ago.

59:44.011 --> 59:49.349
- What do you say?
- No. A lot of people could get hurt.

59:52.769 --> 59:55.730
It's me he wants.

59:55.855 --> 59:58.941
This is his turf. If I leave, he wins.

01:00:00.151 --> 01:00:04.905
- You want that?
- Maybe it'll save people from getting killed.

01:00:05.030 --> 01:00:08.909
- Do me a favor, Bennett.
- Name it.

01:00:09.034 --> 01:00:11.328
Don't use those guns.

01:00:11.453 --> 01:00:14.205
Give me a day to get Fraker.

01:00:14.330 --> 01:00:17.208
Whatever you say. I was just trying to help.

01:00:45.317 --> 01:00:49.196
Hi. Well, you said it was important.

01:00:49.321 --> 01:00:51.865
Thanks for coming. Come on in.

01:00:52.032 --> 01:00:55.201
- I'm leaving the city.
- What?

01:00:56.202 --> 01:01:03.459
A couple of weeks with my sister. And
I'll do whatever I have to not to be here.

01:01:03.584 --> 01:01:08.505
Oh, it's everything.
This place, my job, people I deal with.

01:01:12.133 --> 01:01:15.470
I just wanted to see you one more time.

01:01:15.636 --> 01:01:19.348
I didn't think you wanted to leave this city.

01:01:33.278 --> 01:01:37.448
Do you still think
you don't want to get close to someone?

01:01:41.243 --> 01:01:47.332
You know, my wife didn't just die,
she was murdered.

01:01:47.457 --> 01:01:51.670
They never caught the people that did it.

01:01:51.795 --> 01:01:54.255
And my daughter.

01:01:55.506 --> 01:01:58.050
Anyway, something in me changed.

01:01:58.175 --> 01:02:00.845
Does it have to be that way forever?

01:02:01.595 --> 01:02:03.681
No.

01:02:04.515 --> 01:02:10.103
Why don't you come with me? At least visit.
You don't have to be here.

01:02:10.228 --> 01:02:14.065
- I could do that.
- I bet you want to leave.

01:02:14.190 --> 01:02:17.527
- All you need is an excuse.
- I'll bet you're right.

01:02:19.695 --> 01:02:22.406
I'm hungry. How about you?

01:02:22.531 --> 01:02:25.659
I'm starved. I know a good restaurant.

01:02:25.784 --> 01:02:29.037
- Is it open late?
- They sure are.

01:02:33.958 --> 01:02:36.377
Here he is. They're going.

01:02:46.845 --> 01:02:48.805
Don't lose them.

01:03:06.321 --> 01:03:09.324
Be right back. I'm gonna pick up my mail.

01:03:09.449 --> 01:03:12.285
I'll be right here.

01:03:34.347 --> 01:03:36.432
Come on!

01:04:03.749 --> 01:04:06.293
Somebody call the ambulance!

01:04:21.807 --> 01:04:26.270
People are looking for you up there,
where you shot the punk.

01:04:26.395 --> 01:04:30.232
They have a description.
You were eating an ice cream.

01:04:30.357 --> 01:04:34.944
So you better take it easy for a few days,
for your own damn good.

01:04:35.069 --> 01:04:40.449
- I have places I'm supposed to be.
- That's why you're not gonna be there.

01:04:50.375 --> 01:04:54.337
When he comes out,
take him into protective custody.

01:05:00.384 --> 01:05:05.597
- Come on, pal, you're coming with us.
- Come on, mister, let's move it.

01:05:07.933 --> 01:05:10.769
Come on, mister, get in the car.

01:05:17.608 --> 01:05:19.944
That's my shop!

01:05:28.660 --> 01:05:30.412
My shop! My shop!

01:05:32.455 --> 01:05:35.375
Come on, stay back! Stay back!

01:05:37.168 --> 01:05:38.878
My shop!

01:05:40.921 --> 01:05:43.507
My shop!

01:05:45.008 --> 01:05:47.177
Kersey! Kersey!

01:05:56.644 --> 01:06:01.107
I'll give you something to screech about,
you sons of bitches!

01:06:12.867 --> 01:06:16.454
Kersey, goddamn you! Goddamn you.

01:06:16.621 --> 01:06:19.749
Where is he? He's not where he should be.

01:06:29.674 --> 01:06:31.718
He's got a gun!

01:06:34.304 --> 01:06:38.266
It's not working!
Kill the motherfucker! Kill him!

01:07:08.335 --> 01:07:11.671
Man, can you hear me? Oh, my God!

01:07:18.344 --> 01:07:21.472
You wanna tell Shriker
I'd like to talk to him?

01:07:21.597 --> 01:07:26.059
Well, he don't wanna talk to you.
He told me so. Personally.

01:07:27.352 --> 01:07:32.857
A man's been beaten. He'll identify
his assailants, but only if he talks to you.

01:07:32.982 --> 01:07:36.235
Bennett Cross.
He was armed with a machine gun.

01:07:37.528 --> 01:07:40.573
Dr. Hernandez, please call your office.

01:07:40.698 --> 01:07:42.866
Thank you, nurse.

01:07:43.742 --> 01:07:46.870
- How is he?
- Well, he's a tough bird.

01:07:46.995 --> 01:07:50.582
A couple of bad fractures
but I think he'll make it.

01:07:50.707 --> 01:07:53.877
Can I go in and see him?

01:07:54.002 --> 01:07:56.087
OK?

01:07:59.674 --> 01:08:04.261
- I screwed up. I'm sorry.
- It's all right.

01:08:05.220 --> 01:08:11.267
Listen, Kersey...
I only lost one gun for you there.

01:08:11.976 --> 01:08:15.188
The other one's still there,
in the same place.

01:08:15.855 --> 01:08:18.649
Blow the scum away.

01:08:21.694 --> 01:08:25.988
Dr. Davies, telephone please.

01:08:35.372 --> 01:08:37.625
He had to go someplace.

01:08:45.799 --> 01:08:47.884
Taxi!

01:09:46.313 --> 01:09:49.441
- You wanna take this?
- I saw you come in.

01:09:49.566 --> 01:09:52.193
Used to be Charley's.

01:10:09.042 --> 01:10:13.880
He's back. He picked up some packages
and he's back at the apartment.

01:10:14.005 --> 01:10:16.049
Move.

01:10:19.010 --> 01:10:24.223
Manny Fraker. I need some more guys.
As many as you can spare.

01:10:24.348 --> 01:10:25.766
Yeah. Thanks.

01:10:36.651 --> 01:10:40.071
- What is it?
- It's a Lars missile launcher.

01:10:40.196 --> 01:10:43.240
Anti-tank, anti-personnel weapon.

01:10:43.365 --> 01:10:48.787
And these rounds
are self-propelled, armor-piercing.

01:10:49.913 --> 01:10:52.874
The arm is three feet out of the barrel.

01:10:52.999 --> 01:10:56.753
Won't do me much good,
unless I can get 'em bunched.

01:10:56.878 --> 01:10:59.255
All I got is a zip gun.

01:11:05.052 --> 01:11:07.137
We should get a few of them.

01:11:07.304 --> 01:11:09.806
All right!

01:12:10.362 --> 01:12:16.325
Eli! It's Mr. Kersey!
He just shot some of the creeps!

01:12:56.320 --> 01:13:00.533
Who the hell's firing, man?
You told someone to fire?

01:13:18.591 --> 01:13:19.800
Come on!

01:13:30.727 --> 01:13:34.105
Come on, you guys.
We're gonna get those motherfuckers!

01:14:18.938 --> 01:14:21.524
We're out of ammo!

01:14:24.735 --> 01:14:29.197
Air unit six to base.
Around Sutter and Belmont,

01:14:29.322 --> 01:14:34.661
I've sighted buildings burning. Shots fired
in the street. Looks like we have a riot.

01:14:34.786 --> 01:14:37.163
We need every backup unit available.

01:14:37.872 --> 01:14:39.957
There! There!

01:16:09.664 --> 01:16:11.916
...more money, said the mayor.

01:16:12.042 --> 01:16:15.211
News is coming in
of riots in East New York.

01:16:15.378 --> 01:16:20.925
- I can't see anything.
- Come here. Watch it on television.

01:16:21.050 --> 01:16:24.887
Police are converging there.
Our helicopter is overhead

01:16:25.012 --> 01:16:28.682
with Roy Baxter to bring you
an on-the-spot report.

01:16:28.807 --> 01:16:32.102
- Have you seen the man?
- I haven't seen shit, man!

01:16:32.227 --> 01:16:35.980
Throughout this vast area
of derelict buildings...

01:16:36.105 --> 01:16:38.316
We're on TV, man!

01:16:38.441 --> 01:16:41.694
...groups run and hide in alleys
and apartment buildings.

01:16:41.902 --> 01:16:46.198
There are great sheets of flames
rising from burning buildings.

01:16:46.323 --> 01:16:50.785
The buildings are collapsing.
I can see fires over 20 blocks.

01:16:50.910 --> 01:16:56.374
Police cars are fighting a hail of bullets
as they try to get into the area.

01:16:56.499 --> 01:17:00.211
There are gangs of motorcyclists
down there,

01:17:00.377 --> 01:17:05.966
flanked by gunfire and flames
and smoke. It's a hell of a mess here.

01:17:06.091 --> 01:17:12.597
We'll be back with news as soon
as we can find out what caused this.

01:18:33.838 --> 01:18:35.840
Oh, boy!

01:19:19.046 --> 01:19:20.297
Get him!

01:20:24.064 --> 01:20:26.108
Kersey, look out!

01:21:34.379 --> 01:21:37.507
I'm out of shells. I'll go get some.

01:21:58.234 --> 01:22:00.778
I owed you that one, dude!

01:22:46.111 --> 01:22:49.489
Please!

01:24:57.732 --> 01:25:00.901
Well, now I owe you. How bad is it?

01:25:01.026 --> 01:25:03.654
It's just a nick.

01:25:03.779 --> 01:25:06.198
I'll call an ambulance.

01:25:15.081 --> 01:25:17.124
Hey.

01:25:18.834 --> 01:25:21.128
Bulletproof, asshole.

01:25:21.712 --> 01:25:24.173
Just like yours. Stay like that.

01:25:24.339 --> 01:25:27.217
- You can't have both of us.
- Bet me.

01:25:49.571 --> 01:25:52.449
- Jesus Christ!
- What did that?

01:26:15.303 --> 01:26:19.640
Over at Belmont and Sutter
the crowd is breaking up.

01:26:20.349 --> 01:26:23.018
You better get going.

01:26:26.730 --> 01:26:29.274
I'll buy you a few minutes.

01:26:30.942 --> 01:26:34.362
Get outta here. They'll be after you.

01:30:17.316 --> 01:30:19.402
