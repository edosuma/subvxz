00:07.633 --> 00:09.301
- You're sure that's her?
- Definitely.

00:09.384 --> 00:11.345
- How sure?
- Ninety-five to one hundred percent.

00:11.428 --> 00:13.388
Would you recognize her
if you saw her again?

00:13.472 --> 00:14.890
Yeah. There she is.

00:15.432 --> 00:17.017
- You know what I'm gonna say, don't you?
- What?

00:17.100 --> 00:18.352
- Robert D--
- No. Come on.

00:18.435 --> 00:20.521
- Robert Downey Jr. was not in Tesco's.
- Why not?

00:20.604 --> 00:22.814
Why would he be?
He's got assistants and stuff for that.

00:22.898 --> 00:24.441
No, Robert's not like that.

00:24.525 --> 00:26.485
Robert's like-- He's like you and me.

00:27.277 --> 00:29.238
She must be some sort of relative.

00:29.821 --> 00:31.240
Are we being stalked?

00:32.073 --> 00:33.700
Look, even if that is her, right?

00:33.784 --> 00:35.619
Then it could easily be a coincidence.

00:35.702 --> 00:37.788
- It wasn't a coincidence.
- All right. Let me ask you this.

00:37.871 --> 00:40.040
Did you sit with her,
or did she sit with you?

00:40.874 --> 00:42.084
She sat with me. Yeah.

00:42.167 --> 00:44.419
She definitely sat with me,
and she saw Princess,

00:44.503 --> 00:46.296
and she didn't tell me that she knew her.

00:46.380 --> 00:47.631
Oh, God.

00:47.714 --> 00:50.926
And then she was, like,
saying stuff about family,

00:51.426 --> 00:53.011
about fighting for family.

00:53.095 --> 00:55.264
I think she was trying to intimidate me.

00:55.347 --> 00:56.348
She said…

00:57.057 --> 00:58.809
"My family knew the Krays."

00:58.892 --> 00:59.977
Did she sound like that,

01:00.060 --> 01:02.604
or are you just doing that voice
to make it sound worse, the way people do?

01:02.688 --> 01:04.063
Jase, they are gangsters.

01:04.147 --> 01:06.316
- Get away from the window.
- Nikki, don't be silly.

01:06.400 --> 01:08.402
Look, that's just how people
from the East End speak.

01:08.485 --> 01:12.072
It's all geezer, family, Krays,
geezer, Parklife, geezer.

01:12.155 --> 01:13.949
- There's more.
- What?

01:14.867 --> 01:17.452
I may have opened up to her

01:17.536 --> 01:20.581
- and told her some things.
- What things? What things?

01:20.664 --> 01:22.875
Just about when me
and Princess weren't getting along.

01:22.958 --> 01:25.961
Bloody hell. Can you not meet one person
without telling them everything?

01:26.044 --> 01:27.087
- No, I don't!
- Come on.

01:27.171 --> 01:29.381
Last week the postman asked me
if my rash had cleared up.

01:29.464 --> 01:32.801
And then she was there when you called
when you were taking Tyler to A&E.

01:32.885 --> 01:35.888
Jase, oh, no. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, but I didn't know!

01:35.971 --> 01:38.307
- What if she's dangerous?
- She's not dangerous.

01:38.390 --> 01:39.474
Jase.

01:39.558 --> 01:42.853
She's not dangerous, Nikki. Trust me.

01:44.438 --> 01:45.981
- Okay.
- All right?

02:18.055 --> 02:20.807
Their grandmother? How did she find us?

02:21.350 --> 02:22.851
Do we need protection?

02:22.935 --> 02:24.394
Should we be getting bodyguards?

02:24.478 --> 02:25.562
It's the council.

02:26.063 --> 02:27.731
I had to bring a kettle from home.

02:27.814 --> 02:29.191
We don't have bodyguard money.

02:29.274 --> 02:31.527
But, Noah, I just--
I didn't know that there'd be stalking.

02:31.610 --> 02:33.362
Yeah, we should put that
in the welcome pack.

02:33.445 --> 02:36.615
So, we'd been told
that they couldn't make contact with us.

02:36.698 --> 02:38.617
- Yeah.
- Well, she is their grandmother.

02:38.700 --> 02:40.327
People get ideas.

02:41.370 --> 02:43.539
Look, it's only a few weeks
until we go before the judge.

02:43.622 --> 02:44.456
I'll talk to her.

02:45.249 --> 02:47.000
Does this mean she wants custody
of the kids?

02:47.793 --> 02:50.045
Well, she knows that's not an option
because of her age.

02:50.629 --> 02:52.464
And she didn't try and talk to them.

02:53.465 --> 02:55.133
Well, so what?

02:55.217 --> 02:58.679
Well, I'd say it was you she was watching.

03:08.856 --> 03:11.149
I've never heard of Faraday Books.

03:12.025 --> 03:13.735
Are you sure they're legit?

03:13.819 --> 03:16.238
Yeah. I've scoured the website.

03:16.321 --> 03:18.657
Nothing but quality fonts all around.

03:19.491 --> 03:21.034
It just seems a bit quick.

03:21.118 --> 03:24.997
You know, to read a blog
and then just decide to publish it.

03:25.622 --> 03:28.375
Well, publishing companies are very nimble
these days, you know?

03:28.458 --> 03:29.918
They're very quick to react.

03:30.002 --> 03:32.296
The Internet,
that's where all the talent is.

03:32.379 --> 03:35.465
If Hemingway were writing now,
he'd be writing a blog.

03:36.383 --> 03:39.887
- Why don't you just keep blogging then?
- God, no. Can you imagine?

03:39.970 --> 03:43.473
Hey, lots of A-listers on their books.

03:44.933 --> 03:46.518
There's that comedian.

03:46.602 --> 03:48.228
She's on that panel thing I hate.

03:48.312 --> 03:49.938
And he's a reality person.

03:50.898 --> 03:53.734
These are not A-list celebrities, Scott.

03:53.817 --> 03:57.279
They're Z-list, and that's only
'cause the alphabet only goes up to Z.

03:58.488 --> 04:00.532
I would ask you
to be a little more positive.

04:02.743 --> 04:04.369
I'm sorry.

04:05.412 --> 04:06.705
It's just the--

04:06.788 --> 04:10.459
I have a person inside me
who needs 2,000 calories a day until 2040,

04:10.542 --> 04:15.506
so I'm just not in a "follow your heart,
your dreams fly on magical wings" place.

04:18.300 --> 04:21.553
What-- I do have faith in you, though.

04:22.137 --> 04:23.680
You do?

04:24.473 --> 04:27.017
Good, actually, because,

04:27.809 --> 04:28.852
big news…

04:30.270 --> 04:31.480
I've handed in my notice.

04:32.606 --> 04:33.732
- Wha--
- Yeah.

04:33.815 --> 04:35.984
I think it's the perfect time to jump.
I really do.

04:36.068 --> 04:38.904
And, listen, good things happen
when you commit to things.

04:38.987 --> 04:41.698
You know?
Even if you're not certain it'll work out.

04:41.782 --> 04:43.200
I mean, look at you and I.

04:47.120 --> 04:49.164
Right. I'm off for a nap.

05:00.801 --> 05:03.220
It's awful, being pregnant. It's awful.

05:03.303 --> 05:04.888
- I can't even have a hot bath.
- What?

05:04.972 --> 05:08.100
Yeah. I bathe. I do not shower.

05:08.642 --> 05:10.894
I'm not an American or a muddy dog.

05:12.563 --> 05:14.731
You're just constantly patronized.

05:15.357 --> 05:17.734
- Well, that's nice!
- No, I'll get that.

05:18.318 --> 05:19.403
No.

05:19.486 --> 05:21.196
- You see?
- Right.

05:25.701 --> 05:27.661
Is it okay if we don't stay here too long?

05:27.744 --> 05:28.745
Why?

05:28.829 --> 05:29.872
No, it's…

05:31.748 --> 05:33.750
No reason. I'm just--

05:34.960 --> 05:36.086
Oh, my God.

05:37.087 --> 05:39.256
Oh, my God. That's her.

05:39.339 --> 05:40.382
What?

05:40.465 --> 05:41.466
Who?

05:41.550 --> 05:42.593
Nikki.

05:52.102 --> 05:53.103
Hey.

05:53.896 --> 05:55.814
Oh, God. Sorry.

05:55.898 --> 05:59.193
Sorry, I thought you were someone else.

05:59.276 --> 06:00.402
Sorry.

06:17.127 --> 06:18.295
Hello, mate.

06:20.756 --> 06:22.132
Can I have a look at that?

06:22.883 --> 06:24.176
Tyler, let me have a look.

06:27.721 --> 06:29.014
Thank you.

06:29.097 --> 06:31.808
Those pajamas are a bit big for you,
aren't they, mate, eh?

06:33.393 --> 06:37.439
You know,
I think we might have to let him go.

06:37.523 --> 06:40.567
- Why?
- Well, he's dangerous.

06:40.651 --> 06:43.570
I mean, he's already put you in A&E once.

06:45.072 --> 06:46.073
And I think…

06:47.491 --> 06:52.663
I think it is important
to be able to let things go.

06:53.247 --> 06:56.375
Because it is only just a thing.

06:57.709 --> 07:00.671
And things come and go.

07:02.881 --> 07:06.176
It's people that we need to hang on to.

07:06.969 --> 07:10.472
And you've got us now.
You don't need Adam anymore.

07:13.308 --> 07:16.019
Come here. Here's a good boy.

07:19.189 --> 07:22.150
I'm sorry, but this is clearly
a case of mistaken identity.

07:22.234 --> 07:24.027
You know
you're still holding the shopping?

07:24.528 --> 07:26.071
Not just a scarecrow, eh?

07:26.947 --> 07:28.740
- She called me a scarecrow last week.
- What?

07:29.324 --> 07:32.244
What? is going on?
What is happening?

07:32.327 --> 07:34.121
You know she's pregnant.

07:34.204 --> 07:35.831
You are imprisoning a pregnant woman.

07:35.914 --> 07:38.166
It is bad to stress them out.
They get very stressed.

07:38.250 --> 07:39.251
I'm fine.

07:39.334 --> 07:40.794
I'm not a dolphin at SeaWorld.

07:40.878 --> 07:43.505
- Do you wanna sit down?
- No, I do not want to sit down.

07:43.589 --> 07:45.799
I can see the chair,
and if I wanted to, I would.

07:45.883 --> 07:47.593
- What would be stopping me?
- Yeah--

07:48.552 --> 07:50.137
You? You wait here.

07:54.808 --> 07:56.393
Right, well, I might be off.

07:56.476 --> 07:57.603
Excuse me?

07:58.228 --> 08:00.314
Are you serious? Are you leaving me here?

08:00.397 --> 08:02.858
- Well, you'll be fine.
- Karen, sit down.

08:02.941 --> 08:04.818
Will everybody stop telling me
to sit down?

08:04.902 --> 08:07.779
Fine, well, stand up then,
but you are not leaving.

08:11.283 --> 08:12.409
Gosh…

08:12.492 --> 08:13.410
What?

08:13.994 --> 08:17.289
They want us to have a meeting with Bev,
and I just-- I don't trust her.

08:17.873 --> 08:19.708
I sort of brought you some water.

08:20.375 --> 08:21.793
Did I ask for some water?

08:23.128 --> 08:24.671
Nope. No, you did not.

08:25.547 --> 08:28.133
- I will be right back.
- Okay.

08:28.217 --> 08:29.927
They treat you like an invalid.

08:30.010 --> 08:32.429
I'm still slimmer
than most non-pregnant women, so--

08:32.513 --> 08:34.056
Karen, will you just give it a rest?

08:34.139 --> 08:38.018
- What's the matter with you?
- You! You are driving me mad.

08:38.101 --> 08:40.770
- What--
- Do you know how lucky you are?

08:40.854 --> 08:44.107
I mean, you are gonna have a child,
and you don't have to do anything.

08:44.191 --> 08:48.612
No forms, no assessments,
no stalking grandmas, nothing.

08:48.695 --> 08:50.781
You just have to stay alive.

08:50.864 --> 08:52.032
Nature will do everything.

08:52.115 --> 08:54.952
I mean, you could just lie in bed
for the next nine months if you wanted to.

08:55.035 --> 08:56.411
Childbirth is--

08:56.495 --> 08:57.871
More lying in bed!

08:57.955 --> 08:59.623
It is hard.

08:59.706 --> 09:02.960
Well, then they will give you
free drugs to make it not hard.

09:03.043 --> 09:05.712
Can I take drugs
to take my problems away? No.

09:06.296 --> 09:07.881
Well, yes.

09:07.965 --> 09:10.133
Yes, but they would still be there
when I wake up,

09:10.217 --> 09:13.637
unlike yours, which will have been taken
out of you by a team of experts

09:13.720 --> 09:16.223
and turned into a lifetime of joy.

09:16.306 --> 09:18.183
While you were high!

09:18.976 --> 09:20.686
- The police are on their way.
- The police?

09:21.436 --> 09:22.521
Okay.

09:22.604 --> 09:25.023
Okay, okay.
Can I just explain something to you?

09:25.107 --> 09:27.818
Now is a really bad time
for me to be getting arrested.

09:27.901 --> 09:29.903
Really? Why didn't you say?

09:29.987 --> 09:31.738
Honestly? Honestly.

09:31.822 --> 09:33.574
Well, I didn't think you'd care.

09:34.449 --> 09:36.535
Okay. You're being sarcastic.

09:39.329 --> 09:40.664
Karen?

09:40.747 --> 09:42.624
Karen! Karen, are you okay?

09:42.708 --> 09:45.502
No, I am not. I'm too hot.

09:45.586 --> 09:48.130
And I don't know if it's me
or the room because I never know.

09:48.213 --> 09:50.174
They should put up a sign in hot rooms.

09:51.008 --> 09:53.427
You know, it isn't easy,

09:53.510 --> 09:55.095
and I am getting really scared.

09:55.179 --> 09:56.221
Right, about the police?

09:56.305 --> 09:58.807
No! Not about the police!

09:59.516 --> 10:02.561
You know, I'm 39,
and I'm a geriatric mother.

10:02.644 --> 10:03.645
How is that right?

10:03.729 --> 10:05.480
I haven't even paid off
my student bloody loan.

10:05.564 --> 10:07.065
You know, I looked it up,

10:07.149 --> 10:10.402
and Ryan Giggs, he played
in the Premier League when he was 39.

10:10.485 --> 10:13.989
Yeah. No, he had to drop a bit deeper
to influence the game, but he did the job.

10:14.072 --> 10:16.491
Yes! Yes! He did a job.

10:17.034 --> 10:17.868
Yeah.

10:17.951 --> 10:20.245
You know, I am actually getting
rather stressed here,

10:20.329 --> 10:22.789
so I would like to go home
with my sister now, please.

10:26.418 --> 10:28.003
Yeah, of course.

10:29.338 --> 10:30.547
Right.

10:32.799 --> 10:33.634
Okay?

10:34.384 --> 10:36.136
Yeah, I'm fine. I was just acting.

10:38.305 --> 10:40.307
Well, that was some good acting.

10:40.390 --> 10:41.391
Yeah.

10:43.894 --> 10:45.479
Should we go for a little chat?

10:46.688 --> 10:47.856
Yes, please.

11:06.416 --> 11:07.918
Don't look at me like that.

11:37.406 --> 11:38.699
Hello.

11:40.284 --> 11:42.619
You are Jeanette Forrester.

11:42.703 --> 11:45.163
So, I have to say, for me,

11:45.247 --> 11:50.961
you are one of the top four-- eight
radical literary feminists I've read.

11:51.044 --> 11:51.879
Truly.

11:51.962 --> 11:56.049
<i>Bitch, Lover, Child, Mother</i>, I think,
perfectly captures how we control

11:56.133 --> 11:58.385
and really patronize pregnant women.

11:58.844 --> 12:01.138
I'm insisting my pregnant wife read it.

12:01.805 --> 12:04.057
Yes.
Depictions of motherhood are failing us.

12:04.141 --> 12:06.393
Whitewashed, overexposed simulacrum

12:06.476 --> 12:09.855
of immaculate children in spotless linen
pushed by perky Earth mamas.

12:10.564 --> 12:14.193
The truth is,
a bomb is about to go off in your life.

12:16.236 --> 12:17.696
I see you've met.

12:18.488 --> 12:19.656
Look out for this one.

12:19.740 --> 12:22.284
He's the best satirical spoof I've read
this year.

12:24.494 --> 12:25.787
Shall we? Yeah?

12:25.871 --> 12:26.872
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

12:26.955 --> 12:27.956
Okay.

12:29.374 --> 12:30.417
Wow.

12:30.501 --> 12:33.962
Yeah. I mean, she's nice enough,
but my God, she's intense.

12:34.046 --> 12:35.172
You know, it's all,

12:35.255 --> 12:39.051
"Our enslavement is a story
we tell ourselves."

12:39.134 --> 12:41.637
It's like, you know,
how about some small talk?

12:41.720 --> 12:43.096
Ask me about my weekend.

12:43.180 --> 12:44.515
- You know what I mean?
- Yes.

12:44.598 --> 12:46.558
What did you mean
when you said "spoof"?

12:46.642 --> 12:47.893
Shall we?

12:51.980 --> 12:54.650
And into the office we go.

13:02.491 --> 13:03.700
So…

13:05.035 --> 13:07.120
- So I'm in the comedy department?
- Yeah.

13:08.205 --> 13:10.457
Yeah, we'll get Maya down soon
and talk about marketing,

13:10.541 --> 13:13.877
but, first of all, how excited are we?

13:13.961 --> 13:15.504
Very, yes.

13:16.755 --> 13:20.551
what you were saying just there
about "satirical spoof"?

13:20.634 --> 13:23.679
Yep. I meant every word of it.
You have struck gold with this character.

13:24.638 --> 13:26.306
You see, when you say "character"--

13:26.390 --> 13:30.060
You have perfectly skewered
a certain sort of

13:30.143 --> 13:33.438
ludicrous, performative 21st-century man.

13:33.522 --> 13:36.900
He's lamenting the evils of money
because he's always had it.

13:36.984 --> 13:38.944
He's lecturing people
on structural racism,

13:39.027 --> 13:41.113
but his favorite rapper is Eminem.

13:41.196 --> 13:44.575
You know, he carries his novels face out
so everyone knows what he's reading,

13:44.658 --> 13:47.327
underlining bits
with a small, artisanal pencil.

13:47.411 --> 13:49.204
Yeah, we've all met those morons.

13:49.288 --> 13:50.122
Knock, knock.

13:50.205 --> 13:52.416
Scott, have you seen
the front cover mock-up?

13:52.499 --> 13:54.918
We think we've cracked the title.

13:58.213 --> 13:59.214
Right.

13:59.965 --> 14:01.800
Right. Okay.

14:01.884 --> 14:05.345
Listen, you really can't be too subtle
with the Christmas toilet book market.

14:05.429 --> 14:07.389
You really have to go
balls in the face with it.

14:07.472 --> 14:09.308
Yeah, look, I was thinking,
for the soft launch,

14:09.391 --> 14:11.810
Scott does the whole thing in character.

14:11.894 --> 14:14.271
- Loving your work.
- Yeah, sorry.

14:14.354 --> 14:16.315
You keep saying character, and I just--

14:16.398 --> 14:19.776
This book is real.

14:19.860 --> 14:23.155
- It's serious social criticism.
- Yeah.

14:23.238 --> 14:26.742
I mean,
this is Martin Luther's "59 Theses" speech

14:27.284 --> 14:28.577
from the march on Selma.

14:29.745 --> 14:32.372
This is Dylan without the harmonica, guys.

14:32.456 --> 14:35.459
That's brilliant.
That's brilliant. Do that.

14:35.542 --> 14:37.669
- Yeah.
- No, I'm not doing--

14:37.753 --> 14:39.713
This is not a joke.

14:39.796 --> 14:42.674
But there's
a preparatory reading list in the front.

14:42.758 --> 14:43.634
Yeah, of course there is.

14:43.717 --> 14:47.221
Chapter four is just a list of criticisms
of Alain de Botton.

14:47.304 --> 14:49.264
Yeah, and I pulled my punches.
I promise you that.

14:50.557 --> 14:53.977
- I don't--
- So, this is you?

14:54.061 --> 14:54.895
Yes!

14:56.021 --> 14:57.189
This is me.

14:58.899 --> 15:00.400
Okay, well,

15:00.484 --> 15:01.735
Okay, congratulations.

15:01.818 --> 15:03.779
Funny is funny.
Let's publish and be damned.

15:03.862 --> 15:05.531
No, sorry.

15:05.614 --> 15:09.243
No, I'm not disrespecting
my own work like this.

15:11.161 --> 15:15.874
Okay. Well, then,
I guess you've got a decision to make.

15:18.377 --> 15:20.337
Yeah, I guess I do.

15:37.229 --> 15:39.189
It's just the way she looks at me.
I can just--

15:39.273 --> 15:41.233
I can feel her eyes baring into my soul.

15:41.316 --> 15:43.652
Yeah, but you've got a lovely soul,
haven't you?

15:43.735 --> 15:46.947
So you got nothing to worry about.
She'll only see nice things.

15:47.030 --> 15:49.449
Like when your T-shirt went see-through
on the log flume that time.

15:49.533 --> 15:51.201
- Jason.
- Do you remember that? Yeah.

15:51.285 --> 15:52.286
Jase!

15:52.786 --> 15:55.205
I just think there's no excuse
for maybe stalking someone.

15:55.289 --> 15:57.958
- Like we did with that builder guy?
- Whose side are you on?

15:58.041 --> 15:59.626
I don't know, honestly.

15:59.710 --> 16:02.337
All I know is, there shouldn't be sides.

16:02.421 --> 16:03.422
Look, it'll be fine.

16:03.505 --> 16:05.841
Hopefully, we're not on our own with her
at any point.

16:05.924 --> 16:06.758
Oh, God.

16:17.603 --> 16:18.812
Hello.

16:19.646 --> 16:20.689
Hello there.

16:35.662 --> 16:36.663
- Mint?
- Oh, no, thank you.

16:36.747 --> 16:38.165
- Oh, yes. Give me that--
- Jase.

16:38.248 --> 16:39.249
No, thanks, Bev.

16:44.838 --> 16:46.048
<i>So, from talking to Bev,</i>

16:46.131 --> 16:49.801
I think she's just very keen
to hear how the children are doing.

16:50.469 --> 16:52.095
It's been a long time
since she's seen them.

16:52.179 --> 16:53.222
Well--

16:57.893 --> 16:59.728
I believe you have a photo.

16:59.811 --> 17:00.812
Yes.

17:01.855 --> 17:05.483
Here. That's them a few days ago,

17:05.567 --> 17:07.361
outside the house.

17:12.741 --> 17:14.867
- Thanks.
- Yeah, it's all right. It's okay.

17:15.827 --> 17:19.122
And how is Tyler after the accident?

17:19.205 --> 17:21.625
Did the hospital say it was okay?

17:21.708 --> 17:24.752
They-- He-- Yeah, he's absolutely fine.

17:26.505 --> 17:27.714
- Don't blame yourself.
- No.

17:28.590 --> 17:30.425
Everyone likes a drink every now and then.

17:31.051 --> 17:32.678
It's just when it goes too far.

17:34.429 --> 17:37.474
- That's when the problem starts.
- Yeah, yeah. That's--

17:40.102 --> 17:43.605
And how's Princess?

17:45.607 --> 17:47.359
Are you getting on better with her now?

17:47.442 --> 17:50.112
-'Cause I know it's been hard.
- Good, yeah. It's very good.

17:51.697 --> 17:52.865
It's very good.

17:52.948 --> 17:53.949
Good.

17:54.032 --> 17:55.284
It's good. Yeah.

17:56.201 --> 17:57.202
That's good.

17:59.746 --> 18:00.831
Okay.

18:00.914 --> 18:06.086
So, perhaps you can tell Bev a little bit
about what the kids have been up to.

18:06.920 --> 18:09.214
- What the hell was that?
- What do you mean?

18:09.298 --> 18:10.674
That was not the real her.

18:10.757 --> 18:13.177
- That was not the woman that I met.
- She seemed all right.

18:13.260 --> 18:15.137
I've only got my own mother as comparison.

18:15.220 --> 18:17.181
- She was trying to get us into trouble.
- What?

18:17.264 --> 18:19.099
I wouldn't be surprised
if those mints were poisoned.

18:19.183 --> 18:20.017
Don't be silly.

18:20.100 --> 18:22.144
She was just trying to work out
if we're good people.

18:22.227 --> 18:24.188
- No. I can see her coming a mile off.
- Excuse me.

18:25.772 --> 18:26.857
Sorry.

18:27.900 --> 18:29.610
I made these for the kids

18:29.693 --> 18:31.361
and I wondered if you'd give them to them.

18:32.237 --> 18:33.614
- Cheers, Bev.
- Okay.

18:33.697 --> 18:35.449
- That's all right.
- Thank you.

18:35.532 --> 18:36.700
That's really nice.

18:38.118 --> 18:39.494
All right. Excuse me.

18:40.746 --> 18:42.122
Have a good one.

18:43.707 --> 18:44.708
It's nice.

18:44.791 --> 18:46.668
Hang on.
Sorry, I've gotta take this. It's Scott.

18:46.752 --> 18:49.171
No, I asked him to call me.
Listen, I'll see you after work.

18:49.254 --> 18:50.631
Look, our kids have got exes.

18:51.215 --> 18:53.425
We just have to build relationships
with them, all right?

18:53.509 --> 18:55.219
Just learn to trust a little. Okay?

18:55.302 --> 18:57.346
- Okay. Bye.
- Bye, babe. I love you.

19:15.572 --> 19:17.991
<i>Mate, we need to talk
about the money. What's happening?</i>

19:18.075 --> 19:20.410
Yes, we are at 11,000 currently.

19:20.494 --> 19:22.621
Okay, great. So that's 23 in total?

19:23.121 --> 19:24.790
<i>No, 11 in total.</i>

19:24.873 --> 19:26.708
- What're you talking about? I gave you 12.
-<i>Yes.</i>

19:27.459 --> 19:28.544
And that's currently 11.

19:28.627 --> 19:30.754
- So you've lost a thousand?
-<i>No.</i>

19:30.838 --> 19:32.840
It still has the potential to be 12,000.

19:33.632 --> 19:35.968
But it has currently taken the form
of 11,000.

19:36.051 --> 19:37.052
Mate--

19:37.678 --> 19:42.057
Mate, there is an offer on the flat
that I need to match.

19:42.140 --> 19:44.518
I gave you that money to double it,
not to lose it.

19:44.601 --> 19:47.688
Yeah, well, doubling isn't really a thing.

19:47.771 --> 19:49.731
What about all these rich people
making money on the markets?

19:49.815 --> 19:50.649
What do they do?

19:50.732 --> 19:53.360
I think they have more money
to start with.

19:53.443 --> 19:57.865
Well, can't you just… short it?

19:58.740 --> 19:59.908
Short what?

19:59.992 --> 20:02.327
The money that I gave you,
just short it quickly.

20:02.411 --> 20:03.287
Yeah? Short it.

20:03.370 --> 20:05.956
I don't know
what you think "short it" means.

20:06.039 --> 20:07.749
<i>What am I supposed to do?</i>

20:07.833 --> 20:10.878
We're on a single income.
I need to find somewhere for us to live.

20:10.961 --> 20:14.381
- I have to get another job at least.
-<i>Yeah. Listen, I sympathize, brother.</i>

20:14.965 --> 20:17.176
As a father myself,
I've been thinking of--

20:17.259 --> 20:19.178
Look, just give me the money back.
All right?

20:19.261 --> 20:22.222
Give it back to me,
and please do not mention it to Nikki.

20:22.723 --> 20:24.975
And you've got no idea
how expensive kids are.

20:25.058 --> 20:27.811
<i>There's something new every day.
You've got no idea</i>

20:27.895 --> 20:31.148
<i>what it is like being the thin line
between everyone that you love starving.</i>

20:53.462 --> 20:54.463
Hiya.

20:55.339 --> 20:56.340
Sorry.

20:56.423 --> 20:57.591
Are you okay?

20:59.092 --> 21:00.677
I'm just tired.

21:00.761 --> 21:02.179
I've been up since 6:00.

21:02.262 --> 21:03.555
I didn't wanna be late.

21:05.390 --> 21:06.642
How far away do you live?

21:07.809 --> 21:09.228
Three stops.

21:11.396 --> 21:12.564
Yeah.

21:14.358 --> 21:15.859
You must think I'm very silly.

21:15.943 --> 21:18.070
No. Of course not.

21:18.946 --> 21:20.364
It's difficult for everyone.

21:20.447 --> 21:22.199
Not for you, I'm sure.

21:22.950 --> 21:24.952
You seem very accomplished young people.

21:26.286 --> 21:27.704
Trust me, we're not perfect.

21:28.914 --> 21:30.415
- No?
- No.

21:33.335 --> 21:34.503
We've got our issues.

21:36.088 --> 21:37.089
Really?

21:38.173 --> 21:39.174
Yeah.

21:54.940 --> 21:55.941
Yeah?

21:57.234 --> 21:58.235
I've thought about it.

21:58.318 --> 22:01.196
I'd like to go ahead with the book,
but I have one demand.

22:01.280 --> 22:02.948
I won't agree to any demands.

22:03.615 --> 22:04.616
I accept.

22:21.925 --> 22:23.302
Hello, Dad. Are you around?

22:24.136 --> 22:25.804
I could use a bit of help.

22:34.438 --> 22:35.439
Screwdriver.

22:44.531 --> 22:45.782
Wrench.

22:55.709 --> 22:57.377
Insulated crimping pliers.

23:07.471 --> 23:08.472
Careful.

23:10.349 --> 23:11.350
How's it going?

23:12.184 --> 23:13.936
It's too early to tell.

23:14.520 --> 23:15.646
Okay.

23:16.813 --> 23:18.941
- Keep me updated.
- Will do.

23:45.884 --> 23:48.178
Oh, no, really?

23:48.262 --> 23:50.013
- It's buggered.
- Are you sure?

23:50.097 --> 23:52.766
If it had relatives, they'd be flying in.

23:54.351 --> 23:55.394
Careful.

23:58.438 --> 23:59.731
Oh, no. What's happened now?

24:03.110 --> 24:04.695
I made these earlier.

24:10.951 --> 24:13.328
Oh, yeah. That's much better.

24:13.412 --> 24:15.914
- You mind if I…
- Yeah. No, help yourself.

24:16.623 --> 24:17.624
Ta.

24:27.926 --> 24:29.094
Oh, my God.

24:36.435 --> 24:37.769
So good.

24:38.854 --> 24:40.022
Right.

24:41.648 --> 24:43.400
Heavenly Father.

24:43.483 --> 24:49.364
We thank you
for having entrusted us with Adam.

24:50.324 --> 24:52.868
He really brightened up all of our lives.

24:54.411 --> 24:56.914
- Amen.
- Lovely. Shall we go in now?

24:58.707 --> 25:00.250
We have to read something.

25:00.876 --> 25:02.336
Yeah.

25:03.629 --> 25:06.507
Can we just do this
before Keith and Shelagh get back?

25:07.633 --> 25:09.134
- Do you wanna read that?
- Yeah.

25:11.428 --> 25:16.934
"Thank you for purchasing
this Macmillan table light.

25:17.017 --> 25:20.521
Please read the instructions carefully
before use

25:20.604 --> 25:23.398
to ensure safe and…"

25:23.482 --> 25:25.901
Let's have a look. "Satisfactory."

25:25.984 --> 25:29.655
"…satisfactory operation of this product."

25:29.738 --> 25:32.491
- Amen--
-"Bulb not included."

25:32.574 --> 25:33.784
Amen.

25:35.077 --> 25:35.911
Cover him up.

25:35.994 --> 25:38.163
- Come on then, let's cover him.
- Well done, mate.

25:39.790 --> 25:40.791
Beautiful.

25:44.169 --> 25:46.338
Come on, kids. That's it.

25:47.047 --> 25:48.423
Come on, darling.

25:48.966 --> 25:49.967
Can we have a snack?

25:50.050 --> 25:51.927
What do you reckon?
That enough closure for you?

25:52.010 --> 25:54.346
- Oh, yeah. Yeah, real growth.
- Yeah.

25:54.930 --> 25:56.557
A real watershed moment.

25:58.267 --> 25:59.726
Come on. Get that door.

25:59.810 --> 26:01.270
Let's get inside.

26:05.107 --> 26:06.108
Hello?

26:08.110 --> 26:09.361
Is everything okay?

26:11.071 --> 26:12.406
Yeah. Yeah, I've got a minute.

26:12.489 --> 26:14.241
- You all right, mate?
- Yeah.

26:15.242 --> 26:17.035
It's the begonias. Get in my eyes.

26:17.619 --> 26:18.620
Allergies.

26:19.288 --> 26:20.956
Right, okay. Yeah, thank you.

26:28.213 --> 26:29.131
What?

26:29.965 --> 26:31.008
That was Noah.

26:31.091 --> 26:32.092
Right.

26:34.428 --> 26:36.346
Did you talk to Bev after we left?

26:37.306 --> 26:39.558
- Yeah. I mean-- Not--
- What did you say?

26:39.641 --> 26:41.602
Don't remember. Why?
What's happened? What's happened?

26:41.685 --> 26:43.187
She's made a complaint against us.

26:44.146 --> 26:46.273
She says we're not fit to take the kids.

26:46.356 --> 26:49.276
They're not gonna take that seriously,
are they? She's got nothing on us.

26:51.570 --> 26:54.948
She's saying we're losing the flat,
that we don't have enough money to buy it.

26:55.032 --> 26:56.200
Is that true?

26:56.283 --> 27:00.913
And she's saying that you've gambled
all of our savings without telling me.

27:04.124 --> 27:05.792
Jason, what have you done?
