00:02.000 --> 00:04.162
>

00:10.540 --> 00:13.271
- We're all hiding
something, aren't we?

00:13.310 --> 00:16.177
From the moment we wake,
look in that mirror,

00:16.210 --> 00:19.714
all we do is spin
our little lies,

00:19.750 --> 00:23.015
suck in that gut,
color that hair,

00:23.050 --> 00:24.711
twist off that wedding ring.

00:24.750 --> 00:26.582
(Crow cawing)

00:26.620 --> 00:30.386
And why not?
What's the penalty?

00:30.430 --> 00:34.458
What are the
consequences, really?

00:34.500 --> 00:39.233
"I'm only human,” you say,
and all is forgiven.

00:39.270 --> 00:43.537
But what if some cruel twist of
fate makes you something else,

00:43.570 --> 00:46.301
something other?

00:46.340 --> 00:48.229
Who forgives you then?

00:48.280 --> 00:50.601
Byron wrote
about Prometheus.

00:50.650 --> 00:54.041
"The retched gift
eternity was thine

00:54.080 --> 00:57.311
"and thou has
borne it well..."

00:57.350 --> 00:58.044
- Don't know that one.

00:58.090 --> 01:00.718
- "...making death
a victory."

01:02.530 --> 01:03.383
(Chuckles)

01:03.430 --> 01:06.092
- Wow!

01:06.130 --> 01:07.859
Such light date patter.

01:07.900 --> 01:09.129
(Laughing)

01:09.170 --> 01:11.320
So that's why
you became a nurse?

01:11.370 --> 01:13.338
To help people experience
the victory of death?

01:13.370 --> 01:14.189
(Laughing)

01:14.240 --> 01:16.299
- I'm sorry.
Is that what you asked me?

01:16.340 --> 01:19.105
(Both laughing)

01:19.140 --> 01:20.630
But you know
what I mean, right?

01:20.680 --> 01:21.738
That living thing,

01:21.780 --> 01:24.579
that breathing, living thing

01:24.610 --> 01:26.374
taking its last breath...

01:27.720 --> 01:28.846
it's gorgeous.

01:28.880 --> 01:29.950
(Chuckles)

01:33.860 --> 01:36.488
Every human spends a night
or two on the dark side

01:36.530 --> 01:38.749
and regrets it.

01:38.790 --> 01:41.760
But what if you only exist

01:41.800 --> 01:43.359
on the dark side?

01:43.400 --> 01:46.893
(Cracking, screaming)

01:46.940 --> 01:48.465
- So, this is my place.

01:50.640 --> 01:51.903
Do you wanna come in?

01:53.480 --> 01:55.369
I think I got a really
awful bottle of wine.

01:55.410 --> 01:56.400
(Chuckling)

01:56.450 --> 01:58.703
(Siren)

01:58.750 --> 02:00.912
- How could I possibly
say no to that?

02:05.220 --> 02:08.190
We just want the same things
that you do:

02:08.220 --> 02:12.350
a chance at life,
at love.

02:12.400 --> 02:14.960
We're not so different
in that way.

02:15.000 --> 02:18.721
** When there are spirits
that take our place *

02:18.770 --> 02:21.740
* That take our place *

02:21.770 --> 02:23.568
(Screaming)

02:23.610 --> 02:25.362
(Growling)

02:25.410 --> 02:29.199
* When there's a villain
without a face *

02:29.250 --> 02:31.605
* Without a face *

02:34.680 --> 02:36.079
* When there are spirits *

02:36.120 --> 02:41.581
* That take our place... *

02:41.620 --> 02:45.830
- Sorry, were you
expecting a cheese course?

02:45.860 --> 02:47.749
Come on!

02:47.800 --> 02:49.791
Don't make me embarrass myself.

02:51.100 --> 02:53.330
- And so we try...

02:53.370 --> 02:55.065
and sometimes fail...

02:55.100 --> 02:57.603
(Roaring)

02:57.640 --> 03:01.907
But when you're
something other,

03:01.940 --> 03:03.772
a monster

03:03.810 --> 03:05.869
the consequences
are worse.

03:07.320 --> 03:08.219
Much worse.

03:08.250 --> 03:09.843
* T think I miss you
even more *

03:09.890 --> 03:13.986
You wake up from
your nightmares.

03:14.020 --> 03:15.158
We don't.

03:15.190 --> 03:17.249
* more *

03:17.290 --> 03:19.554
* I think I miss you even *

03:19.600 --> 03:23.491
* I think I miss you
even more *¥*

03:23.530 --> 03:24.520
(Birds chirping)

03:24.570 --> 03:25.765
(Sniffling)

03:26.870 --> 03:30.363
(Fly buzzing)

03:40.780 --> 03:42.214
- Huh?

03:45.690 --> 03:48.182
<i>** I got out of bed today *</i>

03:48.220 --> 03:50.951
* Swear to God
Couldn't see my face *

03:50.990 --> 03:53.322
<i>* I got out of bed today *</i>

03:53.360 --> 03:56.762
* Staring at a ghost *

03:56.800 --> 03:59.690
* Who forgot to float away *

03:59.740 --> 04:02.437
* Didn't have all
that much to say *

04:02.470 --> 04:04.632
* Wouldn't even tell me
his own name *

04:04.670 --> 04:08.174
* Even where'd my body go? *

04:08.210 --> 04:10.941
* Where, where did
my body go? *

04:10.980 --> 04:13.745
* Africa or Mexico? *

04:13.780 --> 04:15.817
* Where, where did
my body go? *

04:15.850 --> 04:19.353
* And where did my body go? *

04:19.390 --> 04:22.189
* Oh have you seen my ghost? *

04:22.220 --> 04:23.949
* Seen my ghost
Seen my ghost *

04:23.990 --> 04:27.255
(Moans, teeth clicking)

04:27.300 --> 04:30.691
* Staring at the ground? *

04:30.730 --> 04:31.663
(Grunt, gasp)

04:31.700 --> 04:34.192
* ..have you seen my ghost *

04:34.240 --> 04:36.436
(Beeping)

04:36.470 --> 04:38.063
* Oh, have you seen
my ghost... *

04:38.110 --> 04:39.771
- (Man):
Stanislav's Mortuary.

04:39.810 --> 04:41.107
- Hey, it's me.

04:43.810 --> 04:44.948
I need your help.

04:44.980 --> 04:46.277
- OK, where are you?

04:52.660 --> 04:55.357
* Oh have you seen my ghost? *

04:55.390 --> 04:58.223
* Seen my ghost
Seen my ghost *

04:58.260 --> 05:00.558
* Oh have you seen my ghost? *

05:00.600 --> 05:03.900
* Staring at the ground? *

05:03.930 --> 05:06.592
* Oh have you seen my ghost? *

05:06.640 --> 05:09.405
* Seen my ghost
Seen my ghost *

05:09.440 --> 05:11.329
* Oh have you seen
my ghost... **

05:11.370 --> 05:14.169
(Metal door sliding, thud)

05:14.210 --> 05:15.769
(Knocking)

05:21.420 --> 05:22.387
(Door shutting)

05:25.890 --> 05:27.358
(Exhaling)

05:31.690 --> 05:32.430
(Rubbing)

05:33.600 --> 05:34.749
(Sighing)

05:34.800 --> 05:36.598
- You little slut.

05:37.530 --> 05:39.089
(Engine starting)

05:40.740 --> 05:42.196
(Cars honking)

05:44.410 --> 05:46.731
- (Woman on PA):
Dr. Davis, telephone please.

05:46.780 --> 05:48.874
Dr. Davis, telephone please.

05:49.980 --> 05:51.379
(Rubbing)

05:59.050 --> 06:00.882
- Hey, you know, there's
a better way to do this.

06:00.920 --> 06:03.981
- Do what?
Be a better monster?

06:04.030 --> 06:05.725
No, thank you.

06:06.930 --> 06:08.819
- Or dignified monster.

06:08.860 --> 06:10.419
(Chuckling)

06:10.470 --> 06:11.426
- You're joking, right?

06:11.470 --> 06:12.221
- You shouldn't
have to run

06:12.270 --> 06:14.534
for woods every time
that you turn.

06:14.570 --> 06:16.402
- Pretty sure the gang
down at the Econolodge

06:16.440 --> 06:19.137
wouldn't take too kindly
to me doing it there.

06:19.170 --> 06:20.205
So...

06:21.540 --> 06:22.473
- So what about
what I said?

06:22.510 --> 06:24.046
What about
the apartment?

06:24.080 --> 06:26.208
(Laughing) - Yeah, it's
perfect. That's a great idea.

06:26.250 --> 06:28.218
Let's do that.
It's perfect.

06:28.250 --> 06:29.786
We'll have
full moon parties.

06:29.820 --> 06:31.584
We'll invite the neighbours
over and eat them.

06:31.620 --> 06:32.485
- Or...

06:34.420 --> 06:37.879
We can look after each other
like normal people.

06:37.930 --> 06:40.092
Aren't you tired
of punishing yourself...

06:40.130 --> 06:42.997
(Sighing) ...squatting in
hostels, and hourly motels?

06:43.030 --> 06:44.691
Don't you ever just
want your own bed?

06:47.100 --> 06:48.989
Besides, God!

06:49.040 --> 06:50.633
What do you do with
a girl if you meet one?

06:50.670 --> 06:52.138
- And yet another
gentle reminder

06:52.170 --> 06:54.776
of how badly my
life sucks. Thank you.

06:54.810 --> 06:57.279
- Seriously, would you
just think about it?

06:58.350 --> 06:59.442
This could help.

07:00.250 --> 07:01.513
Both of us.

07:05.390 --> 07:06.312
- (Thud)

07:07.820 --> 07:12.121
- How could 4 walls and
a toilet possibly help this?

07:16.130 --> 07:17.200
And for the record,

07:17.230 --> 07:20.837
reminding me I haven't
had sex in the last 2 years--

07:20.870 --> 07:21.894
A...

07:21.940 --> 07:24.329
Total lie.

07:24.370 --> 07:24.962
- Sorry.

07:25.010 --> 07:26.409
- No, he is. Please.

07:26.440 --> 07:27.601
- I am.
- I'm Aiden.

07:27.640 --> 07:30.871
- Hi. Um, Cara.

07:30.910 --> 07:32.400
- Josh.

07:32.450 --> 07:33.713
- Are you new here or--

07:33.750 --> 07:34.717
- Yeah, I'm actually--

07:34.750 --> 07:37.947
I'm just filling in
for... Rebecca.

07:37.990 --> 07:38.718
(Gasps)

07:38.750 --> 07:40.149
She didn't
show up in ICU,

07:40.190 --> 07:42.989
so they called me in.

07:43.030 --> 07:44.828
- (English accent):
Welcome, Milady.

07:47.330 --> 07:50.721
- Yeah, I'm actually just
looking for the nurse's station.

07:50.770 --> 07:51.965
Do either of you know--

07:52.000 --> 07:54.162
- Yeah. It's 2nd floor,
left from the elevator.

07:54.200 --> 07:56.396
- Great. Thanks.

07:56.440 --> 07:57.805
(Giggles)

07:57.840 --> 08:00.104
It was really great
meeting both of you.

08:31.510 --> 08:33.831
- Aiden, good to see you.

08:35.240 --> 08:36.674
How you feeling?

08:37.549 --> 08:40.679
Better, right?
After last night, huh?

08:40.720 --> 08:41.948
Pretty girl.

08:41.980 --> 08:43.448
- What are you
doing here, Marcus?

08:43.490 --> 08:45.788
- You know,
the grind.

08:45.820 --> 08:47.686
He's an alderman.

08:47.720 --> 08:49.381
Big muckety-muck!

08:51.060 --> 08:51.856
Yeah, Bishop wants us

08:51.890 --> 08:53.722
to go after more
people of influence,

08:53.760 --> 08:55.626
people of use.

08:55.660 --> 08:57.321
- Well, you can tell
Bishop that the hospital

08:57.370 --> 08:59.065
is off-limits
for recruiting.

08:59.100 --> 09:00.636
- Tell you what...

09:00.670 --> 09:01.990
share him with me

09:02.040 --> 09:05.066
and we'll take him
to Bishop together.

09:05.110 --> 09:06.430
- I don't drink
live anymore.

09:06.470 --> 09:07.631
- Since when?

09:07.680 --> 09:08.875
Last night?

09:10.980 --> 09:12.072
- Leave him alone.

09:12.110 --> 09:13.248
- Yeah, sure.

09:16.890 --> 09:18.710
Bishop will be
so disappointed.

09:18.750 --> 09:19.979
He thought for sure
you were back.

09:20.020 --> 09:22.284
- Tell Bishop what happened
last night was a mistake.

09:22.320 --> 09:23.128
- Sure.

09:23.160 --> 09:24.719
(Grunting, groaning)

09:24.760 --> 09:26.250
Are you back in?

09:26.290 --> 09:28.258
"Cause I don't mind cleaning up
your occasional mess.

09:28.300 --> 09:30.223
That's what we do.
We're family.

09:30.270 --> 09:31.624
But if you are back,

09:31.670 --> 09:33.866
you and I are gonna have
to set a few ground rules.

09:33.900 --> 09:37.404
There's an order now.
There's Bishop and there's me.

09:37.440 --> 09:39.431
You will respect that.

09:39.470 --> 09:42.599
- Don't worry. I know
how many years it took you

09:42.650 --> 09:45.642
to get your nose firmly
inserted up Bishop's ass.

09:47.180 --> 09:48.670
(Both growling, teeth clicking)

09:49.890 --> 09:52.018
- Are we OK in here, Aiden?

10:05.000 --> 10:06.991
(Sighing)

10:10.210 --> 10:12.338
(Car honking in distance)

10:16.380 --> 10:18.178
(Birds chirping)

10:21.620 --> 10:23.042
- Are you serious?

10:23.090 --> 10:25.343
- About what?

10:25.390 --> 10:27.188
- Being normal.

10:29.260 --> 10:31.126
Trying to be.

10:31.160 --> 10:33.299
(Sighing)

10:33.330 --> 10:34.798
- Mm-hmm.

10:38.630 --> 10:39.734
- I used to think this curse

10:39.770 --> 10:41.795
was what happened
to me once a month.

10:44.240 --> 10:47.778
And I realized this--this--
this is the curse:

10:49.680 --> 10:51.273
every day...

10:53.420 --> 10:55.479
sitting on a bench...

10:57.120 --> 10:59.214
watching people walk by...

10:59.250 --> 11:02.720
(Women talking, indistinct)

11:02.760 --> 11:05.127
- ...eating sandwiches,
making plans,

11:05.160 --> 11:06.559
being...

11:09.870 --> 11:12.089
what I used to be.

11:14.300 --> 11:15.335
I always tell myself:

11:15.370 --> 11:17.759
"Well, Josh, this is
what... you get.

11:17.810 --> 11:20.404
"This is what you deserve.
This is what you are...

11:21.910 --> 11:23.799
"NOW."

11:29.850 --> 11:31.409
I can't do this...

11:31.450 --> 11:33.657
like this...

11:34.890 --> 11:36.210
anymore.

11:43.870 --> 11:45.895
- Of course I don't cook.

11:48.500 --> 11:49.865
- You don't eat.

11:49.910 --> 11:51.730
- And I don't clean.

11:53.640 --> 11:55.199
- I have O.C.D.

11:55.240 --> 11:57.402
- Um my credit's crap.

11:57.450 --> 11:59.475
Just putting it
out there.

12:04.320 --> 12:05.390
(Both laughing)

12:05.420 --> 12:08.310
(**All That You Are by
Econo line Crush)

12:13.060 --> 12:16.553
- Took us a month,
but we found it!

12:16.600 --> 12:18.728
¥* If I said it
I meant it... *

12:18.770 --> 12:19.862
There's a view.

12:19.900 --> 12:22.130
- Of an alley.
The plumbing's beat to hell.

12:22.170 --> 12:25.765
- Go upstairs. You can see
a building that can see water.

12:25.810 --> 12:27.300
It's-- There's
a reflection.

12:27.340 --> 12:28.637
(Laughing)

12:28.680 --> 12:29.602
Look at those windows.

12:29.640 --> 12:31.745
I mean, you could rest
a pie on those sills.

12:31.780 --> 12:35.239
- Yeah, you could if you were
an 80-year-old woman.

12:35.280 --> 12:36.918
- This place is
amazing, Aiden.

12:36.950 --> 12:38.281
You know it.
I want it.

12:39.250 --> 12:43.323
- Just play it cool, OK?

12:43.360 --> 12:44.486
- Totally.

12:46.390 --> 12:48.996
- You sure?
- Got it! (Chuckling)

12:49.030 --> 12:52.159
* You're just
one shining star **

12:54.900 --> 12:57.540
- So? What do
you guys think?

12:57.570 --> 13:00.505
- Well, honestly,
it's a little dark.

13:00.540 --> 13:01.371
- Yeah.

13:01.410 --> 13:03.071
- Which a coat of
light paint can help.

13:03.110 --> 13:04.509
A lamp.

13:04.550 --> 13:07.770
You like dark.

13:07.820 --> 13:08.776
- And the plumbing
is a little bit--

13:08.820 --> 13:11.209
- Look, I know.
I keep meaning to fix that.

13:11.250 --> 13:14.515
- Which we can help with.
I mean, what are weekends for?

13:14.560 --> 13:17.928
- Look, truth is, there was
an engaged couple living here.

13:17.960 --> 13:20.122
All right? They started
fixing the place up.

13:21.500 --> 13:22.558
Things didn't
work out.

13:22.600 --> 13:23.362
- What, they split?

13:23.400 --> 13:24.799
- Yeah, sort of.

13:26.400 --> 13:27.538
She died.

13:27.570 --> 13:29.629
- Who died?
- The girl.

13:29.670 --> 13:31.263
- The fiance.
- Yeah.

13:31.310 --> 13:35.975
- In the house? Shouldn't you
have mentioned this in your ad?

13:36.010 --> 13:37.944
- Well, I don't know.

13:37.980 --> 13:38.776
Do people do that?

13:38.810 --> 13:40.574
- Yeah, it's fine.

13:40.620 --> 13:41.678
- Look, if you
don't want the place--

13:41.720 --> 13:42.516
- It's fine?

13:42.550 --> 13:43.415
- People die.

13:43.450 --> 13:45.487
- Yeah. In old-age homes,
in car accidents.

13:45.520 --> 13:46.749
Not with their
heads lodged

13:46.790 --> 13:48.280
in my future oven.
- Josh.

13:48.320 --> 13:49.651
- Yeah, um...

13:51.560 --> 13:53.153
She was my fiance.

13:55.200 --> 13:57.692
- So sorry
for your loss.

14:00.300 --> 14:01.859
- Look, I probably
should've mentioned that.

14:01.900 --> 14:03.368
It's just, um...

14:05.140 --> 14:06.369
I don't come
back here much.

14:06.410 --> 14:09.402
- And that's why you're, uh,
you're out here?

14:11.080 --> 14:12.172
- Look, you two
seem all right.

14:12.210 --> 14:14.975
I know the place
isn't perfect,

14:15.020 --> 14:18.581
but it's a great place
for a couple. It really is.

14:18.620 --> 14:20.156
- What?
- What?

14:20.190 --> 14:21.954
- It's OK.

14:21.990 --> 14:24.322
- So--s0 look,
I can come by on weekends

14:24.360 --> 14:25.987
and do what fix-up I can.

14:26.030 --> 14:29.455
Far as I'm concerned,
any furniture in there is yours.

14:29.500 --> 14:30.990
And honestly...

14:32.770 --> 14:34.761
I don't need
a credit check.

14:34.800 --> 14:38.964
(* The High Dials singing

14:39.010 --> 14:41.433

14:41.480 --> 14:45.007

14:47.680 --> 14:50.843

- Look at you, Julia Child.

15:14.940 --> 15:16.271
- Well, if you're alone
in the kitchen

15:16.310 --> 15:17.971
and you make a mistake...

15:18.010 --> 15:19.239
(Imitating Julie Child):
...who will know?

15:19.280 --> 15:22.170
(Laughing,
electricity crackling)

15:25.820 --> 15:27.652
- What?
- Someone's in the house.

15:28.520 --> 15:29.487
(Utensils rattling)

15:29.520 --> 15:30.885
- Where?

15:31.330 --> 15:32.525
- Upstairs.

15:33.300 --> 15:35.155
Aiden, Aiden.
Wait, wait, wait!

15:35.200 --> 15:36.099
Shouldn't we call 9117

15:36.130 --> 15:38.121
- You're a werewolf.
- Yeah, occasionally.

15:38.170 --> 15:38.693
(Sighing)

15:38.730 --> 15:40.562
- Useless condition.

15:49.040 --> 15:52.442
- Oh, ladies and gentlemen,
the Bobbsey twins!

15:52.480 --> 15:56.144
I am God.
I am everywhere.

15:56.180 --> 15:59.218
I drove all night
just to get back home.

15:59.250 --> 16:02.914
- Are you trying
to scare us with Bon Jovi?

16:07.230 --> 16:09.358
- You can hear me?
- Yeah.

16:09.400 --> 16:11.664
- You went searching
for drug change

16:11.700 --> 16:13.099
under the wrong
couch cushions, lady.

16:13.140 --> 16:13.732
I'm calling the cops.

16:13.770 --> 16:14.532
- Josh.
- What?

16:14.570 --> 16:15.867
- She's a ghost.

16:15.900 --> 16:17.504
- Shut up.

16:17.540 --> 16:19.599
(Gasping, laughing)

16:19.640 --> 16:20.675
You're a ghost?

16:20.710 --> 16:22.030
(Laughing)

16:25.450 --> 16:28.215
- Sorry, I don't totally
have a handle on this.

16:28.250 --> 16:29.672
I'm Sally. Hi!

16:30.990 --> 16:32.242
Crap!

16:35.260 --> 16:37.354
- Wait, what?

16:38.260 --> 16:41.252
- So, you--you--
You've just been here

16:41.300 --> 16:42.290
since you...

16:42.330 --> 16:45.129
- Since I bit it?
Pretty much.

16:46.530 --> 16:47.463
(Giggling)

16:47.500 --> 16:49.867
6 months of a
one-sided conversation,

16:49.900 --> 16:52.961
me ranting, people just
walking through me.

16:53.010 --> 16:55.001
Oh! For a month,
there was these vegans.

16:55.040 --> 16:56.633
Like, this isn't
Burning Man.

16:56.680 --> 16:57.602
You can shower.

16:57.650 --> 16:58.902
- How did you die?

16:58.950 --> 17:00.679
If it's not too
personal a question.

17:00.720 --> 17:01.949
- No, not at all,

17:01.980 --> 17:05.040
especially since
I have no idea.

17:05.089 --> 17:06.740
- At all?

17:06.790 --> 17:09.417
- I remember going to sleep.

17:09.460 --> 17:12.781
I remember lying
next to Danny,

17:12.829 --> 17:15.196
and I woke up
and there was this.

17:15.230 --> 17:16.959
Anyway, you two
gonna go all Twilight

17:17.000 --> 17:18.468
on each other
ever at some point?

17:18.500 --> 17:19.422
- Excuse me?

17:19.470 --> 17:21.290
- I know what you are.
- How?

17:21.339 --> 17:23.900
- Because it's all
you guys ever talk about.

17:23.940 --> 17:25.499
I wanna be normal,
but I can't,

17:25.540 --> 17:28.578
"cause I wanna eat people, etc.

17:28.610 --> 17:30.806
It's OK.
I'm cool with it!

17:30.850 --> 17:32.841
Believe me, the regular living
are overrated.

17:32.880 --> 17:36.077
- So, wait. So, stop.
Let me just get this straight.

17:36.120 --> 17:37.815
So you've just been
watching us, right?

17:37.850 --> 17:39.579
Just going through our things?

17:41.020 --> 17:42.158
Great, great.

17:42.190 --> 17:43.157
We're living with Sally,

17:43.190 --> 17:44.885
the peeper ghost.

17:44.930 --> 17:48.195
- Oh, relax.
I can't even move dust.

17:48.230 --> 17:50.050
And I'm not
a peepetr...

17:50.100 --> 17:52.421
much.

17:52.470 --> 17:54.290
I would have
that mole checked out.

17:54.340 --> 17:56.195
You were pre-med, weren't you?
You should know that.

17:56.240 --> 17:57.901
(Laughing)

17:57.940 --> 18:00.170
- Well, I'm gonna enjoy this.

18:00.210 --> 18:03.771
- You were supposed to marry
what's-his-face, weren't you?

18:03.810 --> 18:05.471
- Danny, yes.

18:05.510 --> 18:08.810
- Right, so why don't you
just go haunt him?

18:08.850 --> 18:10.818
- Josh, just--
- No, I mean, listen.

18:10.850 --> 18:12.409
I'm sorry that
you're a ghost and all,

18:12.450 --> 18:14.885
but, but if you're gonna spend
eternity with someone,

18:14.920 --> 18:17.628
shouldn't it be with
the one that you loved

18:17.660 --> 18:19.424
or, you know,
anywhere but here?

18:19.460 --> 18:21.724
- I'm sorry. I wish I could say
it's a blood-sugar thing,

18:21.760 --> 18:23.524
but Josh is rude
all the time.

18:23.570 --> 18:26.892
- It's OK. Josh,
I would love to leave.

18:26.930 --> 18:29.490
- But she can't, bec-- Right?
- Right.

18:29.540 --> 18:30.564
- You're not
my first ghost.

18:30.610 --> 18:33.272
- So, how can you
see me, anyway?

18:33.310 --> 18:34.380
- Well, think of us
as sort of

18:34.410 --> 18:36.435
different countries
on the same continent.

18:36.480 --> 18:39.575
- Oh my god! That's beautiful,
really. We're Africa.

18:39.610 --> 18:42.341
OK, so about this
whole leaving thing,

18:42.380 --> 18:43.814
have you tried?

18:43.850 --> 18:45.909
- Obviously I've tried.

18:45.950 --> 18:48.351
I haven't been moping
around the house,

18:48.390 --> 18:52.554
rattling chains,
taking bubble baths.

18:52.590 --> 18:54.354
I would love to
just open that door

18:54.400 --> 18:56.289
and magically walk back
into the life

18:56.330 --> 18:58.321
that was ripped away from me.

19:00.900 --> 19:02.698
I did have plans, you know.

19:05.570 --> 19:07.538
- We gotta get to work.

19:08.280 --> 19:09.805
- I'll be here.

19:09.840 --> 19:12.309
- It was great meeting you.

19:13.650 --> 19:16.142
- At lease I don't
masturbate to Nova!

19:22.560 --> 19:25.222
- So you're OK with a ghost
living in our house?

19:25.260 --> 19:27.797
- You do realize that
technically it's her house.

19:27.830 --> 19:30.367
- Look, I'm sorry that she died
and she never got married

19:30.400 --> 19:32.198
and--and she doesn't
know how to move on,

19:32.230 --> 19:34.790
but seriously, I mean,
the whole point of this house

19:34.840 --> 19:37.093
was having one place
where monsters aren't,

19:37.140 --> 19:38.904
where you don't have
to apologize or hide

19:38.940 --> 19:40.669
or think about
what we are.

19:40.710 --> 19:44.044
Where we can eat pizza,
or pretend to eat pizza,

19:44.080 --> 19:47.778
where we can be human for,
like, just an hour or 2.

19:47.820 --> 19:49.072
- And from what I know
about ghosts,

19:49.120 --> 19:51.111
a ghost isn't a ghost
without a reason.

19:51.150 --> 19:52.618
Sally, everything
she knows about ghosts

19:52.650 --> 19:54.482
seems to come from
Whoopi Goldberg. Now,

19:54.520 --> 19:55.681
she knows nothing, Josh.

19:55.720 --> 19:58.189
Would you please give her
a chance to find her way?

19:58.230 --> 20:00.892
(Pipes clinking)

20:00.930 --> 20:03.126
- Where the hell are we?

20:03.160 --> 20:05.561
- They just cleared this
place out for expansion,

20:05.600 --> 20:08.297
but that could
take years.

20:08.340 --> 20:10.229
It's perfect,
isn't it?

20:17.310 --> 20:18.641
You can change down here.

20:18.680 --> 20:21.411
- Into a crazy person?

20:21.450 --> 20:22.940
- Step one,
we got an apartment,

20:22.980 --> 20:24.516
but if you really
want to do this,

20:24.550 --> 20:26.518
_have a chance of
having a normal life. Well,

20:26.550 --> 20:27.949
you gotta find
a reliable way

20:27.990 --> 20:30.379
to deal with your
transformation.

20:30.430 --> 20:32.626
So, step 2,
your own personal--

20:32.660 --> 20:34.298
- Cage.

20:34.330 --> 20:36.594
- It works though,
doesn't it?

20:36.630 --> 20:39.759
You could use it
tomorrow night.

20:39.800 --> 20:40.870
- Does it lock?

20:54.780 --> 20:55.645
(Handle hitting counter)

20:55.680 --> 20:56.841
- Try it.

21:01.190 --> 21:03.329
I can let you out
in the mornings.

21:16.970 --> 21:18.529
(Sniffing)

21:24.480 --> 21:26.107
(Sniffing)

21:38.230 --> 21:39.686
(Gasps)

21:41.560 --> 21:43.392
- Emily?

21:56.040 --> 21:59.169
- Come on, people.
As fast as you can.

21:59.210 --> 21:59.904
Get out
of the way.

21:59.950 --> 22:01.020
- Got a G.S.W.
in the chest.

22:01.050 --> 22:02.814
Hurry up,
he's bleeding out.

22:02.850 --> 22:05.785
Give me an A.B.G,
C.B.C, M-7.

22:11.930 --> 22:13.659
(Groans)

22:17.670 --> 22:20.594
(Sighing, sniffling)

22:32.580 --> 22:34.617
- Sad, isn't it?

22:37.150 --> 22:38.140
Cara.

22:38.190 --> 22:39.214
- Oh, I know.

22:39.250 --> 22:40.285
- OK.

22:41.220 --> 22:42.688
You know, her mom
comes by everyday,

22:42.720 --> 22:43.824
passing out flyers,

22:43.860 --> 22:46.124
which I get, because you want
to do everything you can,

22:46.160 --> 22:47.025
but let's face it,

22:47.060 --> 22:49.927
she's scattered in
a dumpster, isn't she?

22:49.960 --> 22:51.268
I mean, aren't
they always?

22:52.500 --> 22:54.298
Oh God!

22:54.340 --> 22:55.660
Unless you...

22:56.700 --> 22:57.508
you knew her.

22:57.540 --> 22:58.564
(Chuckling)

22:58.610 --> 23:01.102
Anyway, we absolutely
should do something for her,

23:01.140 --> 23:04.144
like, uh, have a vigil

23:04.180 --> 23:09.141
or start a group
or a clothing drive or...

23:09.180 --> 23:10.409
(Chuckles)

23:10.450 --> 23:12.885
Just don't--
Don't listen to me.

23:12.920 --> 23:17.209
I just meant that if it were me,
I would want closure.

23:17.260 --> 23:19.422
- It's OK.

23:19.460 --> 23:22.657
- I've had, like, a hundred
cups of coffee today.

23:22.700 --> 23:23.861
I keep on making it
for the cops,

23:23.900 --> 23:25.766
and then every time
I make a pot,

23:25.800 --> 23:28.189
I think I should stay
and have a cup with them,

23:28.240 --> 23:31.733
because I--I don't want them to
think that I'm hiding anything,

23:31.770 --> 23:33.932
of which, I'm not.

23:33.980 --> 23:36.904
- So, the police
are here again?

23:36.940 --> 23:39.079
- Re-canvassing.

23:51.690 --> 23:53.658
- You're home.

23:53.700 --> 23:54.599
- Yep.

23:54.630 --> 23:56.849
- So, I've been thinking
about what you said,

23:56.900 --> 23:59.392
you know, and...

23:59.430 --> 24:01.489
I think I should
try to move on.

24:01.540 --> 24:02.894
- Great.

24:02.940 --> 24:04.931
- So, I just need you
to call Danny,

24:04.970 --> 24:06.802
tell him to come over,
fix the pipes,

24:06.840 --> 24:08.934
and, uh, I'll take it
from there.

24:13.180 --> 24:15.114
Josh.

24:15.150 --> 24:16.572
If you could call Danny-- - Can
it, can it, can it wait, can it wait?

24:16.620 --> 24:17.690
- It'll take 2 seconds.

24:17.720 --> 24:19.779
- I--I just want to be alone.
I just want to be alone.

24:19.820 --> 24:20.787
And see,
this is the problem.

24:20.820 --> 24:25.155
You're always here,
so I can never be alone.

24:25.190 --> 24:26.282
- Where am I
supposed to go?

24:26.330 --> 24:28.128
- I don't know. Beyond?
I--I--I don't--

24:28.160 --> 24:30.424
- Yes, please.

24:30.460 --> 24:32.462
Look, ike I'd rather be
shacking up with a vampire

24:32.500 --> 24:34.798
and, oh yeah,
a day drinker.

24:37.810 --> 24:38.936
(Laughing)

24:38.970 --> 24:40.870
Josh, I was gonna
get my Master's,

24:40.910 --> 24:42.275
and--and now I have
nothing to read

24:42.310 --> 24:45.177
but stupid blogs
over your shoulder.

24:45.210 --> 24:47.440
I've tried to leave.
I don't know how.

24:47.480 --> 24:51.189
- Then figure it out, Sally.
Figure it out, OK?

24:51.220 --> 24:51.948
Because I--

24:51.990 --> 24:54.459
My life sucks enough

24:54.490 --> 24:57.084
without having to
live in your purgatory.

24:57.120 --> 24:58.849
- You're right.
I have stuff to work out.

24:58.890 --> 25:00.119
(Sighing)

25:00.160 --> 25:02.390
It's like, you don't know
how lucky you are!

25:02.430 --> 25:03.920
(Laughing)

25:04.730 --> 25:06.892
- Lucky. Right, yeah.

25:09.370 --> 25:10.963
- Whatever's going on
with you,

25:11.010 --> 25:12.899
at least you have
the chance to fix it.

25:12.940 --> 25:16.478
It's a bad bump on the otherwise
ongoing road of your life.

25:16.510 --> 25:18.069
I can't do anything.

25:18.110 --> 25:19.703
Can't change anything.

25:19.750 --> 25:20.649
Can't even drink a beer

25:20.680 --> 25:22.216
to make myself
feel better.

25:22.250 --> 25:25.083
So just go on your
pansy-ass mopey kick,

25:25.120 --> 25:26.986
but at least have
the decency to appreciate

25:27.020 --> 25:29.910
that you haven't dropped off
a cliff to nowhere.

25:34.760 --> 25:37.092
- How did you manage
to make this about you?

25:39.100 --> 25:40.522
(Sighing)

25:44.040 --> 25:45.667
(Dishes clinking)

25:46.670 --> 25:47.740
- Last time we spoke,

25:47.780 --> 25:50.499
you mentioned you and
Rebecca were friends.

25:50.540 --> 25:51.939
- We worked together, yes.

25:51.980 --> 25:54.779
- Some of your coworkers tell us
you were more than that.

25:54.820 --> 25:55.378
- More than what?

25:55.420 --> 25:57.582
- More than friends.

25:57.620 --> 25:59.588
When was the last time
you were at Rebecca's apartment?

25:59.620 --> 26:01.816
- Hold--Hold on. I never said
I was at her apartment.

26:01.860 --> 26:04.886
- You've never been in Rebecca's apartment?
- No.

26:04.930 --> 26:05.590
- You sure?

26:05.630 --> 26:08.224
- Aiden didn't
do this, Tim.

26:08.260 --> 26:09.750
- What are you
talking about?

26:13.170 --> 26:14.695
- He didn't do this.

26:20.340 --> 26:22.104
- Of course.

26:22.140 --> 26:23.005
He didn't.

26:23.040 --> 26:25.008
- You're going to
wait in the car

26:25.050 --> 26:26.643
and you were
never here, OK?

26:30.450 --> 26:32.509
- You know what?
I'll be in the car.

26:32.550 --> 26:33.858
- Good.

26:33.890 --> 26:34.914
Thanks, Tim. Bye.

26:36.920 --> 26:38.081
(Sighing)

26:39.230 --> 26:40.459
Good to see
you back, Aiden.

26:46.000 --> 26:48.094
- I'm not back, Bishop.

26:48.140 --> 26:50.165
- Really?

26:50.200 --> 26:52.669
'Cause Marcus said that
girl was so torn up,

26:52.710 --> 26:54.838
you could read the
VIN number off her ribs.

26:54.880 --> 26:56.530
- Marcus is an ass.

26:58.310 --> 26:59.778
- Maybe.

27:00.880 --> 27:03.645
God, Aiden!
It's been months.

27:03.690 --> 27:04.680
- Been busy.

27:04.720 --> 27:06.085
- I can see that.

27:06.990 --> 27:08.651
You look horrible.

27:08.690 --> 27:10.089
- Thank you.

27:10.120 --> 27:13.727
Look, I would take it
as a personal favor

27:13.760 --> 27:16.593
if you would make
this thing disappear.

27:20.840 --> 27:22.194
Please.

27:22.240 --> 27:23.730
- I will.

27:23.770 --> 27:28.276
Well, I would, but it's not
as easy as all that this time.

27:28.310 --> 27:29.675
See, 'cause everybody
seems to know

27:29.710 --> 27:32.145
that Rebecca had
a thing for Aiden,

27:32.180 --> 27:34.911
so it's Rebecca and Aiden,
Aiden and Rebecca.

27:34.950 --> 27:36.816
(Sighing)
We'll get through it.

27:36.850 --> 27:38.579
We always do.

27:38.620 --> 27:39.644
Always will.

27:39.690 --> 27:42.216
- I'm not back, Bishop.

27:42.260 --> 27:44.957
What happened with
Rebecca was a mistake.

27:44.990 --> 27:46.822
- Right, happens to all of us.

27:46.860 --> 27:49.022
Somewhere between the tiramisu
and the naughty bits,

27:49.060 --> 27:51.324
we lose our heads.

27:51.370 --> 27:55.091
It wasn't a mistake, Aiden.
You're a shark.

27:55.140 --> 27:56.869
Be a shark.

27:56.900 --> 27:58.436
- Not anymore.

27:59.310 --> 28:00.971
- All right.

28:01.010 --> 28:02.899
Marcus mentioned your
little blood-bank diet.

28:02.940 --> 28:04.476
How is that going?

28:05.180 --> 28:06.773
Sit down.

28:11.720 --> 28:13.779
200 and how many years
you played at my feet,

28:13.820 --> 28:16.050
now I don't even get
basic common courtesy?

28:18.190 --> 28:19.487
Huh?

28:25.200 --> 28:26.395
I'm worried about you.

28:26.430 --> 28:27.170
- I'm fine.

28:27.200 --> 28:28.429
- Well, you don't
look fine.

28:28.470 --> 28:31.269
- What do you want
from me, Bishop?

28:31.310 --> 28:33.904
You want help with your
little recruiting plan?

28:33.940 --> 28:35.305
- Who said anything
about recruiting?

28:35.340 --> 28:36.478
- Marcus told me everything.

28:36.510 --> 28:37.909
- Forget about Marcus.

28:37.950 --> 28:39.475
What I care about is you.

28:39.510 --> 28:42.878
- No, what you care
about is control.

28:42.920 --> 28:44.012
The changes that I've made,

28:44.050 --> 28:45.415
the life that
I'm trying to live,

28:45.450 --> 28:48.010
oh, you can't
stand that, can you?

28:48.060 --> 28:49.619
- OK.

28:49.660 --> 28:52.789
Would you put yourself
in my shoes for a second?

28:52.830 --> 28:54.025
(Scoffs)

28:54.060 --> 28:57.496
You don't call.
You don't write.

28:57.530 --> 28:59.760
You move in
with a werewolf?

29:02.100 --> 29:03.807
- How did you know that?

29:03.840 --> 29:06.832
- I think you have
no idea what you're up to.

29:06.870 --> 29:08.508
I think you're lost.

29:08.540 --> 29:09.473
I think if
you're not careful,

29:09.510 --> 29:11.103
you may never find
your way back again.

29:11.150 --> 29:14.245
And that, Aiden,
that worries me.

29:14.280 --> 29:15.816
- Is that all?

29:20.290 --> 29:21.712
- Would you believe
that making you angrier

29:21.760 --> 29:23.114
was not the point
of all this?

29:24.130 --> 29:25.950
- Bishop...

29:25.990 --> 29:27.321
you can forget about it.

29:27.360 --> 29:28.589
- Aiden.

29:31.430 --> 29:33.626
It's cold out there
without us, isn't it?

29:47.150 --> 29:48.242
(Two women laughing)

29:48.280 --> 29:49.270
- (Woman 1): OK.

29:49.320 --> 29:52.085
- (Woman 2): Don't you
ruin the time.

30:00.060 --> 30:02.597
- Sorry.
- Josh?

30:08.840 --> 30:10.092
Josh!

30:12.970 --> 30:14.074
(Bird chirping)

30:20.580 --> 30:22.469
Where did you go?

30:24.190 --> 30:26.113
- You found me.
Here we are.

30:27.190 --> 30:28.487
- I wasn't
looking for you.

30:28.520 --> 30:30.614
Jackie broke her
arm "shrooming".

30:30.660 --> 30:32.082
- Jackie, she's--
That's your, uh...

30:32.130 --> 30:34.349
- My girlfriend?
- Right.

30:34.400 --> 30:35.799
- Yeah.

30:36.330 --> 30:37.923
- And her arm's OK?

30:41.240 --> 30:42.730
(Siren in distance)

30:42.770 --> 30:44.204
- I missed you.

30:48.380 --> 30:50.269
- I miss you too.

30:51.410 --> 30:52.400
- So...

30:52.450 --> 30:55.010
- So, how is everybody?

30:55.050 --> 30:58.418
- Everybody?
You mean your family?

30:58.450 --> 31:00.111
We've been freaking out
for the past 2 years,

31:00.150 --> 31:01.857
wondering if you
were dead or alive.

31:03.060 --> 31:04.186
Whatever is happening,

31:04.230 --> 31:07.188
how can you not say anything
to the people who love you?

31:07.230 --> 31:08.391
- Why would you--

31:10.100 --> 31:12.569
I told you not
to worry about me.

31:12.600 --> 31:13.965
- Oh right,
your note.

31:16.900 --> 31:19.540
Josh, did you ever think

31:19.570 --> 31:23.473
that the one thing not to say to
Jewish parents is "don't worry"?

31:23.510 --> 31:24.773
(Chuckles)

31:27.350 --> 31:28.840
Please.

31:28.880 --> 31:29.813
(Sighing)

31:29.850 --> 31:33.150
Please, just tell me
what's going on with you.

31:36.760 --> 31:38.683
- You wouldn't understand.

31:39.890 --> 31:41.426
- Try.
- You wouldn't.

31:44.530 --> 31:46.020
It's complicated.

31:46.070 --> 31:48.493
- Josh, I'm your sister.

31:48.540 --> 31:53.102
I'm genetically inclined
to love you unconditionally.

31:53.140 --> 31:54.630
But I thought we were
also friends.

31:54.680 --> 31:56.136
- I'm happy to see you.

31:59.410 --> 32:01.174
Believe it or not,
I've really...

32:02.250 --> 32:03.615
really missed you.

32:06.550 --> 32:08.279
But I kind of need you
not to tell anyone

32:08.320 --> 32:09.583
that you saw me here.

32:14.060 --> 32:16.256
(Scoffing)

32:16.300 --> 32:17.961
- What would
I tell them anyway?

32:19.030 --> 32:20.759
(Siren in distance)

32:22.440 --> 32:25.899
This has been the least
satisfying reunion ever.,

32:25.940 --> 32:27.305
- I love you. OK, Em?

32:28.440 --> 32:29.510
Just...

32:31.610 --> 32:33.942
I don't know.
Just try to remember that.

32:42.660 --> 32:44.685
(Birds chirping)

33:00.470 --> 33:03.440
(Man speaking Spanish)

33:04.510 --> 33:05.739
(Applause and cheering)

33:05.780 --> 33:07.669
- (All):
Bravo! Bravo!

33:24.770 --> 33:26.625
(Woman screaming)

33:26.670 --> 33:28.138
(Laughing)

33:35.010 --> 33:37.172
(Bishop laughing)

33:51.790 --> 33:53.724
(Telephone line ringing)

33:57.830 --> 34:00.322
- (Woman): Hello?

34:00.370 --> 34:02.190
Hello?

34:02.240 --> 34:04.038
I'm calling about your daughter.

34:04.070 --> 34:05.401
- Yes?

34:07.010 --> 34:07.909
- She's dead.

34:07.940 --> 34:10.830
- What? Who is this?

34:10.880 --> 34:12.507
Hello? Who--

34:47.179 --> 34:48.443
(Crying)

34:50.550 --> 34:52.188
- I've tried to leave.

34:53.190 --> 34:55.511
I really have.

34:55.560 --> 34:57.380
I've stood at the door.

34:58.130 --> 35:00.258
I've stuck out a toe.

35:01.030 --> 35:03.249
I can't stop thinking:

35:03.300 --> 35:05.166
If I do step outside...

35:07.000 --> 35:08.991
what if I just blow away?

35:11.570 --> 35:14.301
What if I can never
find my way back?

35:18.210 --> 35:20.008
What if I never
see him again?

35:21.080 --> 35:22.343
(Crying)

35:31.190 --> 35:33.056
(Gasps)

35:37.260 --> 35:38.898
(Sighing)

35:45.640 --> 35:47.665
(Siren in distance)

35:50.840 --> 35:53.104
(* Rock, muffled
in headphones *)

35:57.320 --> 35:58.788
- Josh?

36:00.690 --> 36:02.351
Josh?

36:06.660 --> 36:07.627
Josh!

36:16.770 --> 36:18.636
- You need to
see something.

36:30.880 --> 36:34.680
- What?
- You're a lot sloppier than you used to be Aiden.

36:34.720 --> 36:37.758
The girl, they know
it was you.

36:55.980 --> 36:56.833
- Josh?

37:06.050 --> 37:08.189
- What are
we doing here?

37:08.220 --> 37:09.756
(Siren in distance)

37:14.300 --> 37:16.155
You told me this
was about Rebecca.

37:16.200 --> 37:18.692
- I took care of that.

37:18.730 --> 37:20.425
It's fine.

37:21.870 --> 37:23.668
- I can't be here.

37:23.700 --> 37:26.909
- It breaks me up to
see you this way, Aiden.

37:26.940 --> 37:28.408
You can understand
that, right?

37:30.040 --> 37:31.701
I gave you eternal life.

37:31.750 --> 37:32.672
I want you to live it.

37:32.710 --> 37:35.111
- No, you want me
to fall in line.

37:35.150 --> 37:38.074
- I'm not gonna lie to you.
I never have.

37:38.120 --> 37:40.111
Things are
about to change.

37:40.150 --> 37:41.584
But that's neither
here nor there.

37:41.620 --> 37:44.681
What's important is this:

37:47.090 --> 37:50.628
Life doesn't have
to be so hard.

37:50.660 --> 37:52.219
Not for us.

37:55.200 --> 37:57.430
Come with me, Aiden.

38:41.050 --> 38:42.575
(Sighing)

38:48.120 --> 38:49.258
- What are you doing here?

38:49.290 --> 38:51.054
- What are you
doing here?

38:53.930 --> 38:54.852
- You've got to leave.

38:54.900 --> 38:55.890
- You have to leave!
You have to leave!

38:55.930 --> 38:58.695
- Two years of nothing,

38:58.730 --> 39:00.721
and you can't
even talk to me?

39:00.770 --> 39:02.135
No way!

39:02.170 --> 39:02.932
No!

39:02.970 --> 39:04.335
- No, no, no!

39:04.370 --> 39:06.668
Look, look, I'll, uh...

39:06.710 --> 39:07.461
I'll come see you.

39:07.510 --> 39:09.069
I'll come see you.
I, ju--promise.

39:09.110 --> 39:09.838
I just need to be--

39:09.880 --> 39:11.029
I need to be
alone right now.

39:11.080 --> 39:13.742
- I know why
you ran away, Josh, OK?

39:13.780 --> 39:14.975
You think I'm an idiot?

39:15.020 --> 39:16.647
Everything was
ahead of you,

39:16.680 --> 39:19.217
cookie-cutter perfect,
just like Mom and Dad.

39:19.250 --> 39:20.684
You panicked.
I get it.

39:20.720 --> 39:24.156
You're not nearly as
mysterious as you think you are.

39:24.190 --> 39:25.851
- All right, I hear you.
I really do.

39:25.890 --> 39:27.756
- Why punish me?

39:27.790 --> 39:29.656
You were my best friend.
Why shut me out?

39:29.700 --> 39:30.849
(Breathing unevenly)

39:30.900 --> 39:32.959
- Look, Emily,
I told you it's comp--

39:33.000 --> 39:35.537
It's complicated and--

39:35.570 --> 39:37.459
(Groaning)

39:37.500 --> 39:39.901
- Are you sick?
- I'm sorry. Just go.

39:39.940 --> 39:40.907
- What are you doing?

39:40.940 --> 39:41.930
- You have to go!

39:41.980 --> 39:43.129
- Josh!

39:46.410 --> 39:48.640
- Oh no!

40:04.260 --> 40:06.627
- Welcome back,
Mr. Aiden.

40:47.140 --> 40:48.801
(Cell phone beeping)

40:51.480 --> 40:53.778
- Come on, Aiden. Please!

41:01.760 --> 41:03.615
(Cell phone ringing)

41:03.660 --> 41:05.822
(Ringing)

41:05.860 --> 41:07.123
Please. Aaah!

41:07.160 --> 41:08.594
- Let me help you!

41:08.630 --> 41:10.291
- (Growling):
Stay away from mel!

41:10.330 --> 41:12.128
You stay away from me!

41:38.590 --> 41:39.625
(Whimpering)

41:43.660 --> 41:46.061
Sally. Sally.

41:46.100 --> 41:49.400
Are you home?
Can you hear me?

41:49.440 --> 41:51.602
Please, listen to me.

41:51.640 --> 41:52.869
If there's any chance,

41:52.910 --> 41:55.436
any way you can leave
the house,

41:55.480 --> 41:58.279
any way you can find Aiden
or find me,

41:58.310 --> 42:01.302
tell--tell him
I'm in the roo-- the room

42:01.350 --> 42:03.614
and my sister's here.

42:06.750 --> 42:09.390
And the door's locked.

42:09.420 --> 42:11.889
He'll--he'll know
what that means.

42:11.930 --> 42:13.659
Please.

42:13.690 --> 42:15.328
Listen, if...

42:17.930 --> 42:19.227
Please, if you don't come,

42:19.270 --> 42:22.194
if someone doesn't
open that door...

42:23.740 --> 42:25.606
I will kill her.

42:25.640 --> 42:28.735
Sally, please.

43:03.580 --> 43:04.945
(Groaning)

43:06.480 --> 43:07.902
- Josh!

43:07.950 --> 43:09.020
(Grunting)

43:09.050 --> 43:10.211
(Groaning)

43:12.220 --> 43:13.642
(Whimpering)

43:13.690 --> 43:15.215
(Cracking, groaning)

43:17.560 --> 43:19.551
- Oh!

43:19.590 --> 43:20.921
(Growling)
