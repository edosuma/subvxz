00:00.084 --> 00:02.084
It's up for discussion
at the board meeting.

00:02.252 --> 00:04.879
I love my job, I'm good at it,
and I'd like to keep it.

00:06.000 --> 00:07.047
I love you,

00:07.217 --> 00:08.758
I just think we should break up.

00:08.926 --> 00:11.672
You're the only one who's never left me.
I'm not gonna leave you.

00:11.878 --> 00:13.679
I'm gonna stay here. For good.

00:13.847 --> 00:15.640
You're gonna go to college
and get a degree.

00:15.897 --> 00:16.955
Do you hear me?

00:17.080 --> 00:19.143
They offered the job to Wade Aikmen.

00:20.917 --> 00:23.984
The board would like to offer you
the position of head coach

00:24.109 --> 00:25.490
at East Dillon High.

<i>I'm Sammy Meade,
and folks, let me tell you,</i>

00:37.441 --> 00:41.764
<i>the sky is dry, the fields are brown,
the drought is long</i>

00:41.889 --> 00:43.273
<i>and it has happened:</i>

00:43.603 --> 00:46.354
<i>this town has been divided.</i>

00:53.913 --> 00:54.927
Thanks, babe.

00:55.839 --> 00:56.843
Good luck.

00:59.501 --> 01:00.637
I love you.

01:31.743 --> 01:33.551
- Wade, listen to me!
- Buddy, I know.

02:05.276 --> 02:07.057
<i>¿Qué estás haciendo aquí, tú?</i>

02:07.182 --> 02:08.187
Sorry...

02:08.797 --> 02:10.176
<i>- Coach Taylor.
- ¿Quién?</i>

02:10.505 --> 02:12.463
Coach Taylor, football team.
Coach Taylor.

02:12.632 --> 02:15.217
<i>- Here, no hay football team.
- The new coach for the football team.</i>

02:15.769 --> 02:17.716
- New football team?
- That's right.

02:18.889 --> 02:20.682
<i>Don't kick my door, por favor.</i>

02:47.264 --> 02:49.251
You know there's a raccoon in here?

03:01.056 --> 03:03.015
On the ground! On your stomach!

03:03.258 --> 03:06.523
On your stomach! Right now!
Let's go! Buddy, it's over.

03:06.648 --> 03:08.187
On the ground!

03:11.107 --> 03:13.220
Next, let's go, come on!
Name?

03:13.484 --> 03:15.027
- Calvin.
- Take the chain off.

03:17.272 --> 03:18.488
Take the chain off.

03:18.784 --> 03:21.325
Do you see this man?
It's 18 G's right here, dawg.

03:22.958 --> 03:25.662
Take the chain off
and you're gonna call me Coach Taylor.

03:27.171 --> 03:28.730
Landry, hey, what's up?

03:30.182 --> 03:31.201
Kenny...

03:31.871 --> 03:33.204
Olsen, from JV.

03:33.859 --> 03:36.010
- What position you want to play?
- Quarterback.

03:36.799 --> 03:38.889
- What are you going out for?
- Let's go, next.

03:40.510 --> 03:42.346
- I'm...
- I'm going out for quarterback.

03:42.514 --> 03:45.182
- What position you wanna play?
- You know, quarterback.

03:45.391 --> 03:47.170
- Quarterback.
- Quarterback.

03:48.812 --> 03:50.852
We found our quarterback, gentlemen!

03:51.011 --> 03:52.213
Step off, next!

03:56.694 --> 03:57.896
All the way up!

03:58.774 --> 04:00.070
All the way down!

04:32.436 --> 04:33.271
Listen up!

04:35.112 --> 04:36.942
Called you out here today
to see what we got.

04:38.720 --> 04:41.321
And after 18 minutes,
I think I've seen enough.

04:43.731 --> 04:46.409
I want you all to go home tonight
and think long and hard...

04:47.117 --> 04:48.777
on how much you want this,

04:49.413 --> 04:50.915
on whether you want this.

04:52.306 --> 04:54.823
If you don't, that's fine,
there's no shame in that.

04:55.169 --> 04:58.046
I don't want you wasting my time
and I don't wanna waste yours either.

04:59.588 --> 05:00.921
If you do want it,

05:01.932 --> 05:04.678
then be out here tomorrow morning
at 6 a.m, we'll get after it.

05:05.153 --> 05:08.411
But get your rest tonight, 'cause
I promise you you're gonna need that.

05:26.335 --> 05:27.424
Hey, Coach.

05:29.672 --> 05:31.935
Good, good.
Ken Shaw. 12th precinct.

05:32.915 --> 05:34.599
Your brother used
to play ball for me?

05:34.724 --> 05:36.970
- Sure did. Mike Shaw.
- That's right, Mike.

05:37.095 --> 05:38.545
Linebacker. How's he doing?

05:38.816 --> 05:41.089
He's doing pretty good,
speaks very highly of you.

05:41.257 --> 05:43.816
- He ended up playing?
- He played for a couple of years,

05:43.951 --> 05:46.213
but he got hurt,
so he had to step out.

05:46.338 --> 05:47.868
- Tell him I said hello.
- I will.

05:48.033 --> 05:49.355
What d'you got here?

05:50.572 --> 05:52.309
You've heard
of Cops 'N' Jocks, right?

05:53.075 --> 05:55.362
- Second chance.
- Yeah, second chance program.

05:55.487 --> 05:57.678
Well, we just brought this kid in
this morning.

05:57.897 --> 06:00.900
You know, he's a decent kid,
but he's got a record now.

06:01.068 --> 06:03.529
Next stop is juvie for him
and that's a bad path.

06:04.071 --> 06:07.198
- What kind of record?
- Minor stuff, nothing major.

06:07.366 --> 06:09.442
I'm talking about
breaking and entering...

06:09.567 --> 06:10.910
Did he kill anyone?

06:11.203 --> 06:12.433
Not animals?

06:13.691 --> 06:16.001
Like I said, these are
mostly non-violent offenses.

06:16.126 --> 06:18.562
- What do you mean, mostly?
- You can help him out.

06:20.931 --> 06:22.461
You wanna meet him?

06:23.414 --> 06:24.702
Since you brought him,

06:24.827 --> 06:26.818
- I guess I should.
- I hope so, yeah.

06:29.969 --> 06:31.951
How you doing, son?
Coach Taylor.

06:33.069 --> 06:34.642
- Vince.
- Vince?

06:35.647 --> 06:37.061
You've ever played football?

06:37.473 --> 06:39.356
Yeah, all the time.
Madden.

06:39.689 --> 06:40.565
How's that?

06:40.998 --> 06:42.233
- Madden.
- Madden?

06:43.085 --> 06:45.341
- Madden?
- It's a video game, Coach, Madden.

06:45.988 --> 06:47.119
Madden football.

06:47.608 --> 06:49.326
You ever play any real football?

06:50.437 --> 06:53.077
- Threw the ball around with my friends.
- Do you like to run?

06:53.678 --> 06:55.872
He can run, Coach.
The boy is fast, real fast.

06:56.734 --> 06:58.417
- You like to hit?
- Hit what?

06:58.650 --> 06:59.657
People.

07:00.706 --> 07:01.805
I like that.

07:03.153 --> 07:06.591
But what would you say if I needed you
to be here tomorrow at 6 a.m. sharp?

07:07.694 --> 07:09.976
6 a.m. sharp means 5:45.

07:13.722 --> 07:14.783
I'll be here.

07:16.767 --> 07:19.267
4x01: EAST OF DILLON

Benj!, Collioure, DarKsh, Gates44
GillesSilb, Jenn, Ju, Nam, Tactactac

08:02.212 --> 08:05.564
Buddy, you know those people.
You can get them to refile their papers.

08:06.175 --> 08:08.311
We can handle that,
that's not a big deal.

08:08.436 --> 08:10.989
- We can fix that...
- Gentlemen, Tami Taylor!

08:13.021 --> 08:14.867
Not necessary, thank you.

08:15.035 --> 08:16.423
Thank you very much.

08:17.246 --> 08:20.581
We need to acknowledge the huge part
you played in this redistricting effort.

08:20.786 --> 08:24.309
Because of it, our athletic program
is already seeing the positive effects.

08:25.651 --> 08:28.605
Good, good. I hope y'all get
everything you deserve this year.

08:28.730 --> 08:31.467
Thank you for stepping up
and doing the right thing.

08:32.537 --> 08:33.669
Good, good.

08:34.842 --> 08:37.059
Are we gonna talk about football?

08:37.184 --> 08:39.767
Were your ears burning,
'cause we were just talking about you?

08:39.934 --> 08:41.352
Yeah, we were.

08:41.520 --> 08:43.104
Talking about Friday's festivities.

08:43.272 --> 08:45.690
We would love for you
to do the coin toss this Friday.

08:46.155 --> 08:49.235
The coin toss?
Ain't that Mayor Roddell's...

08:49.403 --> 08:52.405
I'll handle Lucy. I'll handle her.
We want you.

08:53.732 --> 08:56.567
We think it is very important
that all of us show

08:56.943 --> 08:58.703
that we are all in this together.

08:59.515 --> 09:01.423
So, it would be an honor

09:01.832 --> 09:03.499
and it would mean a lot to us

09:03.667 --> 09:06.210
and we're thinking that maybe
you should call "heads".

09:10.174 --> 09:13.217
We're just kidding.
You call whatever you wanna call!

09:14.762 --> 09:17.430
You can call whatever you want
in the coin toss.

09:18.589 --> 09:19.890
I'm honored. Thank you.

09:20.239 --> 09:22.852
- Make sure you think about it.
- Okay, I'm thinking about it.

09:23.420 --> 09:26.688
"... your thoughts are my own thoughts.
My daughter should be yours,

09:26.813 --> 09:28.941
"and you my son-in-law,"
so he's entreating there,

09:29.254 --> 09:32.227
"if you remained."
That's the difference of going home.

09:32.352 --> 09:34.990
Every hero has a journey.

09:35.431 --> 09:37.633
Early literature is obsessed
with the journey.

09:37.758 --> 09:39.049
Strain the hero.

09:39.174 --> 09:43.331
Odysseus's journey is like a process
to help him appreciate his earlier life,

09:43.499 --> 09:45.061
his love, Penelope, right...

09:45.669 --> 09:46.946
the home he left.

09:47.294 --> 09:50.296
So why don't we pick up then
where we left off yesterday?

10:20.833 --> 10:22.620
Come on now!
Look alive, look alive!

10:28.544 --> 10:30.961
That's awful!
Get 'em in a huddle, right now.

10:31.129 --> 10:34.010
You gotta clip your hips, right.
Push' em up, right?

10:34.508 --> 10:36.132
Put your hands down on your knees.

10:36.301 --> 10:39.001
Heads up, alright?
This is called a huddle.

10:39.217 --> 10:41.063
You gotta understand
what a huddle is.

10:41.213 --> 10:43.565
This is your quarterback here.
He's gonna tell you what to do.

10:43.690 --> 10:46.810
Toss us the rock, man, for real.
It's boring as hell, man.

10:46.935 --> 10:49.605
You can have the ball
when you can actually run a play.

10:51.942 --> 10:54.172
Alright, now knock it off.
It's called a huddle.

10:54.486 --> 10:56.660
It's called a rock
and it looks like I got it now.

10:57.374 --> 10:59.865
- You think that's funny?
- I'm just joking man.

11:03.302 --> 11:04.954
My bad.
Man, I was just joking.

11:05.568 --> 11:07.706
Somebody get somebody!
I'm sorry.

11:07.874 --> 11:09.160
Coach, you all right?

11:09.360 --> 11:11.276
- I'm done. I'm done.
- What's wrong?

11:11.918 --> 11:13.932
I'm done! I'm done!

11:14.553 --> 11:16.917
Where you going?
Coach, where you going?

11:22.303 --> 11:23.103
So...

11:23.419 --> 11:26.510
is your focus in metal works
or electronics?

11:26.893 --> 11:28.384
My focus is in art.

11:29.621 --> 11:31.605
What kind of art
are you interested in?

11:33.852 --> 11:35.991
I don't know.
The kind that I do, I guess.

11:36.286 --> 11:39.113
Well, that's the thing.
I don't know I would call this art.

11:41.781 --> 11:43.297
What would you call it?

11:43.654 --> 11:46.078
I would call it drawing,
without a point of view.

11:46.916 --> 11:48.559
It's not that I don't like it.

11:48.684 --> 11:51.625
- But it's not saying anything.
- They thought the opposite

11:51.793 --> 11:54.379
at the Art Institute in Chicago
when they accepted me.

11:54.611 --> 11:57.304
And that's a much better art school
than Dillon Tech.

11:57.799 --> 11:59.716
Then why are you here
in Dillon Tech?

12:02.679 --> 12:04.263
Kiddo, so do you have a plan...

12:04.497 --> 12:06.265
- Something?
- What do you mean?

12:06.433 --> 12:07.330
For life.

12:07.764 --> 12:08.705
For life?

12:08.986 --> 12:10.477
- To do...
- Riggins Riggs.

12:10.774 --> 12:12.341
That's your plan?

12:13.566 --> 12:14.398
Awesome.

12:14.566 --> 12:16.980
So, where are you gonna stay?

12:17.845 --> 12:19.881
- What do you mean?
- Like live.

12:20.006 --> 12:22.108
- Billy, tater me.
- In Dillon?

12:22.545 --> 12:24.715
- I'm gonna stay right here.
- Here?

12:26.268 --> 12:27.077
Here.

12:29.177 --> 12:31.559
That's great.
Baby, can I...

12:31.859 --> 12:34.335
talk to you, for a second?
Over here.

12:34.711 --> 12:35.600
Thanks.

12:36.747 --> 12:38.790
- So good.
- Yeah, it's really good.

12:40.258 --> 12:41.383
How are you?

12:42.701 --> 12:44.065
Good to see you.

12:45.408 --> 12:47.264
How you doing?
How's you dad?

12:47.544 --> 12:49.516
Gentlemen, how you doing?
How's it going?

12:49.684 --> 12:51.148
Same old time, you?

12:51.519 --> 12:52.436
Skeletons.

12:53.083 --> 12:55.784
I hear Wade's got a golf cart
out there, is that the case?

12:56.048 --> 12:58.025
The man loves his ride, he does.

12:58.193 --> 13:01.862
We move the ball 15 yards down field,
he drives to the next hole.

13:04.016 --> 13:05.783
Why don't you all come on over?

13:06.636 --> 13:08.310
Why dontcha all come over?

13:08.831 --> 13:10.071
That'd be nice.

13:10.539 --> 13:12.914
I don't think
I could explain it to Susan.

13:14.317 --> 13:16.022
Job security and all that stuff.

13:16.844 --> 13:18.999
Not young enough to take pay cut.

13:19.426 --> 13:20.968
All those chances, you know.

13:21.093 --> 13:22.966
- All right.
- Ladies and gentlemen.

13:23.134 --> 13:25.635
- Principal Taylor.
- Hey, everybody.

13:26.739 --> 13:29.799
Nice to see y'all.
Thanks for coming out.

13:30.440 --> 13:31.427
And I just...

13:31.552 --> 13:33.643
I'm thrilled to welcome everybody

13:33.768 --> 13:36.526
to another great year
in Dillon High.

13:36.651 --> 13:39.270
And, before I get going
with the events tonight...

13:39.395 --> 13:41.568
- I wanna thank you...
- I have a question.

13:42.402 --> 13:45.489
- We're gonna have a Q&A at the end.
- Why is my child being forced?

13:46.147 --> 13:48.950
- Nobody is being forced...
- That's exactly what's happened!

13:49.992 --> 13:53.121
Why you making my brother
go to a different school?

13:53.963 --> 13:56.209
First, I'd like to clarify,
we're gonna have a Q&A...

13:56.334 --> 13:58.251
My parents went to this school

13:58.419 --> 14:00.587
before you ever heard
of Dillon High.

14:00.893 --> 14:02.088
Yeah, exactly.

14:02.256 --> 14:06.176
I wanna know why our daughter
is being sent out

14:06.344 --> 14:07.719
to that hellhole

14:07.887 --> 14:09.596
- with that element.
- First of all,

14:09.764 --> 14:12.933
let's not refer to East Dillon
in this way, okay?

14:13.101 --> 14:14.643
I do not tolerate...

14:14.811 --> 14:17.104
Would you say
the two schools are equal?

14:17.577 --> 14:19.689
- Yes, I would.
- You'd send your child there?

14:20.090 --> 14:24.027
I would. She has been zoned
for West Dillon and she's going there.

14:24.152 --> 14:27.489
- Her dad works there...
- I do look at the 2 schools as equal.

14:31.878 --> 14:33.678
You should send her there.

14:41.012 --> 14:44.339
This is impossible to get anything
accomplished this way, y'all.

14:56.840 --> 14:58.452
Hey, how you doin' today?

15:01.642 --> 15:04.297
- Haven't seen one in a while.
- Something wrong with it,

15:04.422 --> 15:06.596
and gotta get it repaired
if that's alright.

15:06.911 --> 15:08.120
I won't do it.

15:08.371 --> 15:09.948
- What?
- Sir, it's garbage.

15:10.256 --> 15:12.367
It's garbage now
and it was back in 1992.

15:12.631 --> 15:15.203
It wasn't purchased here.
If you think I'm gonna let

15:15.371 --> 15:17.425
the finest football coach
in the state of Texas

15:17.550 --> 15:20.458
walk out that door with a box
of garbage, you do not know me.

15:21.843 --> 15:24.170
- You got a manager around here?
- Stan Traub.

15:24.518 --> 15:26.596
I'm a great admirer of Coach Taylor.

15:27.216 --> 15:28.925
Well... Thank you, Stan.

15:30.347 --> 15:32.512
Traub... How I know that name?

15:32.886 --> 15:35.569
Nobeck County.
Pop Warner Coach of the Year 2005.

15:35.968 --> 15:38.325
Second place finisher
in 2006, 7 and 8.

15:40.116 --> 15:42.647
I also faxed 5 or 6 of my resumes
to you at East Dillon.

15:43.494 --> 15:45.651
I left you messages
on the voicemail.

15:45.776 --> 15:46.984
Oh yeah, that's it.

15:47.445 --> 15:49.663
- How you'll handle South King?
- How's that?

15:49.788 --> 15:52.365
They run that spread,
but that QB's gonna freeze up on you

15:52.533 --> 15:54.417
- if you blitz...
- You had a repair guy?

15:54.542 --> 15:56.411
- I can help you.
- I need to get this...

15:58.441 --> 15:59.664
I got you covered.

16:00.069 --> 16:01.916
I'm the real deal. I'm good,

16:02.449 --> 16:04.711
I'm cheap. I'm volunteer cheap.

16:04.879 --> 16:06.421
You will not regret this.

16:07.851 --> 16:09.132
I think it'll be fun.

16:09.485 --> 16:13.075
- It's a Panther party.
- It's not a Panther party.

16:13.664 --> 16:16.269
Beth is a cheerleader,
Friday is the first game.

16:16.394 --> 16:18.892
We can acquiesce to the fact
that it's a Panther party.

16:19.197 --> 16:21.414
Devin and Landry
are going to be there.

16:21.539 --> 16:22.941
It's like a kick-back.

16:23.066 --> 16:25.385
Fine. You know what,
let's stay in,

16:25.510 --> 16:27.569
and watch
the Deadliest Catch marathon.

16:27.694 --> 16:31.112
- We can get pizza after your shift.
- Fine, we'll go.

16:31.477 --> 16:33.573
I have to deliver a pizza right now.

16:41.827 --> 16:43.278
Here are your pizzas.

16:45.753 --> 16:48.838
So, do you make your girlfriend
deliver pizza with you all the time?

16:52.325 --> 16:53.426
$18.75.

16:54.170 --> 16:57.010
It sucks you didn't go to Chicago
like you were supposed to.

16:58.104 --> 17:00.016
I was gonna go
after Julie this year.

17:01.664 --> 17:02.904
I'm just kidding.

17:03.180 --> 17:05.104
Weren't these supposed
to have cinnamon sticks?

17:08.634 --> 17:09.968
Thanks for the tip.

17:10.210 --> 17:11.361
Let's go! Hustle up!

17:16.461 --> 17:18.646
Hey, what are you doing?
What are you doing?

17:18.771 --> 17:19.911
What are you doing?

17:20.079 --> 17:22.031
What hole are you going through?
Was it 24-power?

17:22.156 --> 17:23.435
- 4 hole.
- The 4 hole?

17:23.560 --> 17:25.713
- Then go through the 4 hole!
- The 4 hole!

17:25.838 --> 17:26.969
Come on, now.

17:29.300 --> 17:31.255
What are you doing now?
Wait a sec!

17:32.023 --> 17:34.709
- What are you doing? You're killing me.
- I'm moving closer!

17:34.834 --> 17:37.303
- You're moving closer...
- So I can get to the 4 hole!

17:37.811 --> 17:40.777
Don't talk back to me!
Those fellas in stripped uniforms,

17:40.902 --> 17:42.725
they'll throw flags,
how many yards it'll be?

17:43.022 --> 17:44.381
- 5.
- Right, 5 yards.

17:44.506 --> 17:46.569
Here's what you're wanna do,
right over here.

17:46.694 --> 17:48.854
This is the 4 hole,
you'll go through the 4 hole

17:48.979 --> 17:51.764
and once you get through there
you're keep going downhill.

17:51.889 --> 17:53.653
- Yes, sir.
- Come on, let's go!

18:03.169 --> 18:04.812
Goddamn, I didn't expect that.

18:05.187 --> 18:08.167
I cannot believe what I witnessed.
That's genius, Coach.

18:08.544 --> 18:10.974
This is exactly why I am here,
I'm serious.

18:11.099 --> 18:13.589
- I got goose-bumps.
- That's good.

18:14.055 --> 18:15.171
Hey, Vince.

18:15.843 --> 18:17.843
That was damn nice.
Damn nice.

18:19.417 --> 18:21.222
What do we got next? Let's go!

18:29.784 --> 18:32.537
- Ignore it.
- So pretty rough over at East Dillon?

18:32.662 --> 18:34.403
It's rough, to say the least.

18:34.528 --> 18:36.916
I'm constantly, like, ready.

18:37.470 --> 18:39.782
I got a piece on me at all times.

18:44.321 --> 18:45.329
Julie Taylor!

18:46.443 --> 18:48.657
- How are you?
- Hey, J.D.

18:48.926 --> 18:51.075
So where's pizza man?

18:52.713 --> 18:54.293
He's gonna meet me later.

18:55.174 --> 18:58.648
My mom said she'd die
before she'd send me there.

18:58.886 --> 19:01.512
Like, she would literally
end her life?

19:01.836 --> 19:03.292
Hunger strike probably.

19:03.417 --> 19:04.844
Hey, you know Luke?

19:09.104 --> 19:11.480
You come watch me
make history on Friday night?

19:11.792 --> 19:13.566
Actually, I'm gonna go
see the Lions.

19:14.118 --> 19:15.526
I have news for you.

19:15.694 --> 19:18.559
Your dad's coaching a team
that's not gonna have one "W".

19:19.556 --> 19:20.364
But...

19:20.945 --> 19:22.241
I'm liking your chances.

19:25.621 --> 19:27.413
He's been kicking a few back.

19:27.581 --> 19:30.583
You know what, your dad could still
be coaching for Dillon.

19:30.879 --> 19:32.957
My dad gave your dad a shot.

19:36.923 --> 19:38.132
Your dad's an ass.

19:38.656 --> 19:41.093
Okay, so now
I gotta throw you in the pool.

19:41.261 --> 19:43.429
- Stop it! Stop it!
- Hey, J.D.

19:43.597 --> 19:45.848
- What? Hey!
- Gonna throw you in the pool.

19:46.841 --> 19:48.430
Get the hell off her!

19:49.686 --> 19:52.021
What are you doing? Get off her!
Don't put your hands

19:52.189 --> 19:54.440
- on my girlfriend, okay?
- What's your problem?

19:55.656 --> 19:56.941
Shut the hell up!

20:04.117 --> 20:06.243
- What, Landry?
- Get off him!

20:08.689 --> 20:10.789
Coach shouldn't have
taken me out of the game!

20:11.322 --> 20:12.708
He just felt sorry for you.

20:16.445 --> 20:18.589
- Just shut up!
- You suck!

20:19.425 --> 20:21.383
I'm really glad
this wasn't a Panther party.

20:21.551 --> 20:23.001
It's my Dillon now!

20:29.751 --> 20:33.373
Billy, gotta be honest with you.
This is kind of gross.

20:34.334 --> 20:37.280
I mean, whatever just happened
to pink or blue?

20:37.698 --> 20:38.722
Boy or girl?

20:39.124 --> 20:41.961
Mindy doesn't wanna know,
so we gotta use neutral tones.

20:42.086 --> 20:45.364
- Which is puke in this case?
- It's mustard, jackass.

20:45.489 --> 20:48.535
If I threw up on this wall
you wouldn't know it, this color's puke.

20:48.703 --> 20:49.794
It's mustard.

20:50.132 --> 20:53.108
- Agree to disagree.
- Seriously, do you have a problem?

20:54.029 --> 20:55.719
- Whatever.
- Whatever?

20:57.781 --> 21:00.276
- Billy, watch yourself.
- Shut your mouth.

21:00.401 --> 21:03.021
- Watch yourself.
- Or what? What are you gonna do?

21:06.944 --> 21:08.448
Billy, what the hell?

21:08.807 --> 21:10.759
You come into my house
and act like this?

21:11.268 --> 21:12.434
Get off me!

21:13.350 --> 21:15.145
What the hell was that?

21:15.495 --> 21:16.605
I made a joke.

21:16.773 --> 21:18.396
It's not a freaking joke!

21:20.737 --> 21:22.319
You're throwing away your life!

21:23.103 --> 21:26.227
I busted my ass for 8 years
to try and put you into college

21:26.352 --> 21:27.950
and you can't even make a month.

21:28.118 --> 21:29.451
You and Lyla...

21:30.007 --> 21:32.329
wanted me to go to college,
I never said once...

21:32.713 --> 21:34.998
- I wanna go to college.
- What you gonna do?

21:36.848 --> 21:39.043
I don't know
what you're thinking sometimes.

21:39.168 --> 21:42.379
That you're gonna waltz back in here
and everything's gonna be okay?

21:42.918 --> 21:44.466
I got a wife, Tim.

21:45.381 --> 21:46.866
I'm about to be a dad.

21:51.715 --> 21:53.513
There's no room for you here.

21:56.192 --> 21:57.588
Guess you're right.

21:59.565 --> 22:01.011
You know what, Billy?

22:03.717 --> 22:05.671
All I want to do is come home.

22:15.662 --> 22:17.625
I don't like
that we have to do this.

22:17.750 --> 22:20.532
Nine students here
have been notified their transfer

22:20.657 --> 22:24.036
and are refusing to change schools.
What choice do we have?

22:29.493 --> 22:31.847
Ms. Cody?
I'm sorry to interrupt...

22:32.198 --> 22:32.998
y'all.

22:34.359 --> 22:35.526
Devin, honey,

22:35.651 --> 22:39.396
- I'm gonna need you to come with me.
- Should I bring all my stuff?

22:39.936 --> 22:41.189
That'd be good.

22:51.742 --> 22:52.784
Thank you.

23:12.138 --> 23:16.141
You just have to pull the slot machine
and elbow the midget in the face.

23:16.309 --> 23:17.950
You understand though,

23:18.221 --> 23:20.270
I'm always gonna be a Panther

23:20.438 --> 23:21.755
- in my heart.
- Who cares?

23:21.880 --> 23:23.572
They're a bunch of idiots this year.

23:23.697 --> 23:25.984
But a bunch
of talented, fast idiots.

23:26.152 --> 23:27.756
We're just a bunch of sucky idiots.

23:27.881 --> 23:30.363
Alright, so in the Panthers,
you're a scrub right?

23:30.531 --> 23:33.543
On the Lions, you might play.
You might even start!

23:33.801 --> 23:36.490
So you're trying to encourage me
by saying that the Lions

23:36.657 --> 23:39.313
are bad enough
that someone as bad as me might

23:39.438 --> 23:41.124
actually see some playing time?

23:41.728 --> 23:42.918
Yeah, basically.

23:43.086 --> 23:44.239
Yeah, grandma.

23:44.516 --> 23:47.723
Why aren't you throwing the ball?
You know you got a game Friday night.

23:47.848 --> 23:50.305
Coach Taylor
is gonna expect you to be ready.

23:50.430 --> 23:52.387
Remember,
I'm not on the team anymore.

23:52.512 --> 23:53.850
Coach isn't either...

23:53.975 --> 23:55.963
Yeah, that'll be the day,
I adore you.

23:56.088 --> 23:57.914
Coach Taylor not a Panther...

24:00.566 --> 24:02.687
Stop throwing the ball,
you look like a girl.

24:02.855 --> 24:06.338
- I'm gonna throw one more.
- No, you look like a girl!

24:06.505 --> 24:09.611
- You're just a funny looking creature.
- It's good seeing you.

24:10.357 --> 24:11.863
She seems to be doing well.

24:12.404 --> 24:14.616
You think it's a bad sign
Julie ain't call me back?

24:15.509 --> 24:17.051
Probably not a good sign.

24:17.266 --> 24:19.658
You did look like a jackass
at the party the other night.

24:19.783 --> 24:20.914
J.D. is a chump!

24:21.386 --> 24:22.977
He's pretentious, he's...

24:23.144 --> 24:25.001
Aren't you supposed
to rise above that?

24:25.169 --> 24:27.345
Aren't you supposed
to turn the other cheek?

24:27.470 --> 24:30.173
In your typical
Matt Saracen kind of way.

24:31.442 --> 24:32.815
Take the high road.

24:33.070 --> 24:35.502
Right. Take the high road.
What Matt always does.

24:35.627 --> 24:37.026
Get behind me Satan...

24:44.583 --> 24:45.397
Dog?

24:48.255 --> 24:49.067
Brother.

24:54.781 --> 24:55.831
Bottoms up.

25:02.822 --> 25:03.873
What's your name?

25:06.460 --> 25:08.566
Olan, you need
to tighten up your splints.

25:08.691 --> 25:10.843
We're gonna run the ball,
play defense.

25:10.968 --> 25:11.989
Defense!

25:12.527 --> 25:15.525
You need to figure out...
why it is you're out here.

25:15.650 --> 25:17.466
This dude can talk, man.

25:17.851 --> 25:19.799
Like that dude from the infomercial.

25:23.819 --> 25:25.774
You're a funny looking dude, man.

25:26.541 --> 25:27.981
Kinda look like Opie.

25:29.212 --> 25:31.360
You understand?
Maybe if I shine you up...

25:32.608 --> 25:35.318
Do you need a toy or something
to keep your attention?

25:35.485 --> 25:38.121
Will you please
just shut up and listen to him?

26:06.195 --> 26:07.195
Cowards!

26:09.229 --> 26:12.153
Cowards, that's what you all look like.
A bunch of cowards.

26:12.487 --> 26:15.296
You all look like
a bunch of dumb asses out there.

26:16.711 --> 26:19.054
You don't fight on my field!

26:21.126 --> 26:23.953
Y'all wanna fight?
Go ahead and fight, but not on my field

26:24.162 --> 26:25.712
and not in my colors.

26:27.083 --> 26:28.041
You got me?

26:28.391 --> 26:30.161
- Is that understood?
- Yes, sir.

26:30.286 --> 26:32.225
You don't fight in my house!

26:32.361 --> 26:35.465
Let me tell you something else,
there's no talking back on the field.

26:36.151 --> 26:37.879
There's no wearing earrings.

26:38.046 --> 26:39.531
There's no jewelry.

26:40.070 --> 26:42.531
There's no damn necklaces out there!

26:42.698 --> 26:44.662
There's no talking to each other.

26:45.225 --> 26:46.809
There's you shutting up

26:46.977 --> 26:48.539
and there's me talking!

26:53.634 --> 26:54.534
You two.

26:54.701 --> 26:56.889
You two are gonna make it right,
right now!

26:57.056 --> 26:58.529
Make it right, right now.

27:03.205 --> 27:04.305
I apologize.

27:09.845 --> 27:12.357
- Screw you, Rudy.
- Get your stuff and get out of here!

27:12.524 --> 27:15.053
You get your stuff
and get out of here right now!

27:15.591 --> 27:17.840
Get it right now
and get out of my house!

27:18.271 --> 27:20.051
Get the hell out of my house!

27:20.488 --> 27:22.845
Go, go!
Pack it up and get out!

27:23.315 --> 27:27.016
If anyone else in here
doesn't wanna be here, get out now!

27:29.047 --> 27:30.728
Get the hell out of my house

27:31.139 --> 27:32.926
if you don't wanna be here!

27:33.870 --> 27:35.107
Get out now!

27:35.597 --> 27:37.679
You don't wanna be here, then leave!

27:46.798 --> 27:47.902
Anybody else?

27:48.455 --> 27:49.346
No, sir.

27:51.007 --> 27:52.157
Anybody else?

27:52.979 --> 27:53.829
No, sir.

27:57.881 --> 27:58.972
We're good?

28:02.281 --> 28:03.638
I wanna play, Coach.

28:06.397 --> 28:07.547
I wanna play.

28:48.765 --> 28:50.474
Aren't you Tim Riggins?

28:53.084 --> 28:54.601
Panthers Tim Riggins?

28:55.021 --> 28:56.868
I know you hear me talking.

28:58.076 --> 29:00.056
I wonder if my mom
knows she slept with you?

29:00.181 --> 29:02.201
Well, she knows it, but...

29:02.326 --> 29:05.444
maybe it was dark,
she didn't realize it was Tim Riggins.

29:05.777 --> 29:07.951
So, is she alive back there?

29:09.636 --> 29:10.736
She's alive.

29:10.983 --> 29:14.039
Is she gonna be
in any condition to drive anytime soon?

29:16.170 --> 29:17.626
That's what I thought.

29:17.999 --> 29:19.865
Look, whatever you did to her,

29:20.421 --> 29:22.878
way to go #33,
but I need a ride to school.

29:27.445 --> 29:28.888
OK, try it again.

29:33.351 --> 29:35.519
- Your truck always break down?
- Sometimes.

29:36.070 --> 29:37.878
Why don't you get a new truck?

29:39.449 --> 29:41.497
So did you hear me singing
this morning?

29:42.100 --> 29:43.277
Sounded good, huh?

29:43.671 --> 29:46.385
Kinda makes you wanna stand up
and put your hand over your heart.

29:46.552 --> 29:48.240
- Like Faith Hill.
- For real?

29:48.408 --> 29:49.528
I love her!

29:50.547 --> 29:53.203
- I could sing for you if you wanted to.
- Try it again.

29:59.201 --> 30:01.628
What's it like being the guy
who used to be Tim Riggins?

30:01.998 --> 30:03.548
I'm still Tim Riggins.

30:04.509 --> 30:06.508
But, you know what I mean, though.

30:06.717 --> 30:09.785
You're all center of the universe
in Texas one year and the next,

30:10.470 --> 30:13.487
- fall off a cliff.
- I haven't really thought about it.

30:14.245 --> 30:15.893
What do you do with yourself now?

30:16.061 --> 30:18.041
How far is your school from here?

30:18.447 --> 30:20.824
- Not far, why?
- You gonna need to walk.

30:28.996 --> 30:31.542
Guys don't usually do
repeat performances with my mom,

30:31.667 --> 30:33.244
so guess I won't be seeing you.

30:36.660 --> 30:38.163
Good luck, Tim Riggins.

30:38.288 --> 30:40.165
Hope you find
what you're looking for.

30:43.420 --> 30:44.936
There's only eighteen here.

30:45.061 --> 30:47.592
Guess more of them decided
to take up on your offer to leave.

30:48.087 --> 30:50.562
That was a risky move.
That might not have paid off.

30:50.687 --> 30:51.862
I wish you'd learn

30:51.987 --> 30:54.139
to filter your thoughts better.
That'd be helpful.

30:54.987 --> 30:56.396
Filter my thoughts.

30:58.966 --> 31:00.366
Malcolm left, too?

31:01.312 --> 31:02.648
Malcolm left, too.

31:05.410 --> 31:06.901
Malcolm left too.

31:08.343 --> 31:09.655
Here's what we'll do.

31:10.087 --> 31:12.969
We're gonna line up in the power Iowa
and perfect the 5 and the 6.

31:13.094 --> 31:14.201
Perfect 5 and 6.

31:14.369 --> 31:17.537
We're gonna power the ball downfield
and keep the ball away from South King.

31:18.966 --> 31:20.513
You need to stop doing that.

31:20.680 --> 31:23.157
You need to stop repeating
everything I say!

31:26.532 --> 31:28.057
It's freaking me out.

31:34.462 --> 31:36.891
You know we got no chance
to win this game.

31:37.293 --> 31:38.684
What are you doing here?

31:39.749 --> 31:42.521
- I came to coach them up.
- Not with that hat on, you know.

31:43.136 --> 31:44.402
You got another one?

31:44.569 --> 31:46.528
The last one I got.
We're outta money.

31:49.292 --> 31:50.413
It's alright.

31:54.385 --> 31:55.929
<i>Folks, it is here.</i>

31:56.054 --> 31:56.896
<i>D-Day.</i>

31:57.021 --> 32:00.583
<i>Not one, but two football games
in our little town.</i>

32:01.249 --> 32:03.969
<i>Will redistricting destroy
Dillon football as we know it?</i>

32:04.094 --> 32:05.691
Smells funny in there...

32:08.005 --> 32:10.146
OK, you look nice.
We need some more cream.

32:10.271 --> 32:11.849
I'll try to get it this weekend.

32:12.303 --> 32:16.040
Can you see that hook back there?
Can you get it for me, thank you.

32:16.764 --> 32:20.038
I can't believe I'll miss your game.
The first game of our relationship.

32:20.163 --> 32:22.671
- A good one to miss.
- I'm sad about it.

32:22.796 --> 32:25.721
- You flip the coin, critical role.
- Are you sad, stressed out?

32:25.846 --> 32:28.040
- Don't be brave.
- Nothing to be stressed out.

32:28.165 --> 32:29.526
There you go, I gotcha.

32:29.694 --> 32:31.945
Tell you what I'm gonna do,
I'll flip my coin.

32:33.212 --> 32:36.575
And then I'm gonna sneak out,
and come over to East Dillon.

32:37.789 --> 32:40.767
- And gonna watch y'all get your "W".
- Flip the coin!

32:41.176 --> 32:44.479
- Gross, gross, gross...
- Hi, honey!

32:45.422 --> 32:47.053
Are you ready for school?

32:47.314 --> 32:49.421
I think I'm gonna go
to East Dillon this year.

32:50.232 --> 32:51.047
What?

32:52.590 --> 32:53.884
Well, I mean...

32:54.343 --> 32:57.756
Devin goes there, Landry goes there,
all my other friends have graduated.

32:57.881 --> 33:00.562
So I think
that it's a really good move for me.

33:02.680 --> 33:05.729
You keep saying how East Dillon
is just as good as West Dillon.

33:05.897 --> 33:07.272
And I just think

33:07.440 --> 33:10.811
it would be beneficial to our family
if I went to East Dillon.

33:13.625 --> 33:14.625
Alright.

33:15.411 --> 33:16.865
Good. It's decided.

33:21.967 --> 33:23.167
Say something.

33:34.759 --> 33:37.677
<i>I am on the battlefield</i>

33:37.845 --> 33:40.335
<i>For my Lord.</i>

33:41.725 --> 33:44.659
<i>I'm on the battlefield</i>

33:45.269 --> 33:47.520
<i>For my Lord,</i>

33:48.372 --> 33:51.733
<i>And I promise Him that I...</i>

33:52.596 --> 33:55.704
<i>I will serve Him 'til I die.</i>

33:56.418 --> 33:59.449
<i>I'm on the battlefield...</i>

33:59.618 --> 34:01.451
<i>For my Lord.</i>

34:02.796 --> 34:04.204
Here we go. Take a knee!

34:04.420 --> 34:07.540
How we doing on time?
Good? Alright.

34:10.110 --> 34:11.878
Everybody got what they need?

34:12.047 --> 34:13.911
Everybody squared the way
with equipment?

34:17.023 --> 34:19.636
Listen up, now.
A few of you have been here before.

34:20.061 --> 34:21.606
A few of you have not.

34:21.731 --> 34:25.391
One thing we've all got to do tonight,
is we've got to focus.

34:26.576 --> 34:27.993
The game plan.

34:28.437 --> 34:30.480
The fundamentals.
Moving the sticks,

34:30.649 --> 34:32.232
that's what we're gonna do.

34:32.996 --> 34:34.525
And listen, fellas.

34:35.391 --> 34:37.630
There's a joy in this game,
is there not?

34:38.899 --> 34:42.574
There's a passion to this game
as a reason why we're all out here.

34:43.467 --> 34:46.246
Other than the fact
that the pride that it gives us

34:46.858 --> 34:49.415
and the respect that it demands,

34:49.715 --> 34:52.377
we love to play the game,
so let's go out there

34:52.545 --> 34:54.212
and let's have fun tonight.

34:54.380 --> 34:57.382
Do you understand me?
Because tomorrow...

34:57.551 --> 35:01.302
if you give a 100% of yourself tonight,
people will look at you differently.

35:01.722 --> 35:04.264
People are gonna
think of you differently.

35:05.279 --> 35:06.563
And I promise you...

35:08.318 --> 35:10.979
You're gonna look and think
differently about yourselves.

35:13.899 --> 35:16.603
Clear eyes, full hearts...

35:20.852 --> 35:22.115
Can't lose.

35:22.725 --> 35:24.617
Clear eyes, full hearts...

35:24.785 --> 35:26.119
Can't lose!

35:26.288 --> 35:29.288
Let's hear it, gentlemen.
Clear eyes, full hearts...

35:29.457 --> 35:32.000
- Can't lose!
- Let's go play some football.

35:36.547 --> 35:37.803
Let's go!

35:47.474 --> 35:49.934
<i>Opening night here
in Panther Stadium.</i>

35:50.103 --> 35:53.229
And I tell you,
this crowd is pumped up!

35:53.639 --> 36:00.027
<i>O say, does that star-spangled</i>

36:00.196 --> 36:05.862
<i>banner yet wave</i>

36:06.702 --> 36:11.622
<i>O'er the land of the free</i>

36:13.822 --> 36:16.655
<i>and the home</i>

36:16.780 --> 36:20.673
<i>of the brave.</i>

36:25.095 --> 36:28.306
You've got four quarters to play
your hearts out. You understand that?

36:28.475 --> 36:30.725
- Yes, sir!
- Go for it!

36:36.176 --> 36:39.400
Listen up, we win the toss,
we wanna go D, okay?

36:39.977 --> 36:42.612
That means we're kicking off,
we wanna go D.

36:42.781 --> 36:44.155
Defense, we're kicking off!

36:44.324 --> 36:47.909
- Let's go, boys!
- Tami, we like heads!

36:50.204 --> 36:52.583
- How you doing? Tami Taylor.
- Good evening.

36:53.040 --> 36:55.291
- Shake your hands, please.
- Well done.

36:55.751 --> 36:57.347
Nice to meet you.
Welcome.

36:57.472 --> 37:00.276
Principal Taylor is honorary captain,
she's gonna call the toss.

37:00.401 --> 37:02.960
We have heads, we have tails.
What are you gonna call?

37:03.085 --> 37:05.426
- Tails.
- The call is tails.

37:06.884 --> 37:08.554
Tails it is.

37:08.723 --> 37:11.700
- Choice?
- We will take the ball. Offense.

37:12.035 --> 37:13.267
What did she say?

37:13.436 --> 37:16.312
- No, we wanted defense.
- Please step around right here.

37:16.481 --> 37:20.386
What did she say?
Offense? Offense?

37:20.693 --> 37:23.027
Y'all have a great game, now.

37:23.196 --> 37:26.656
Change of plans!
Listen up!

37:28.200 --> 37:29.992
<i>And here we go, folks.</i>

37:30.370 --> 37:32.953
<i>Oh, it's a long, high,
beautiful kick.</i>

37:33.122 --> 37:36.791
<i>And East Dillon football is back.
It's Vince Howard to the goal line.</i>

37:36.960 --> 37:39.126
<i>He finds a lane to the outside.</i>

37:40.420 --> 37:41.712
Run it, baby!

37:41.880 --> 37:43.422
<i>Look at this kid go, he is fast.</i>

37:44.841 --> 37:46.133
<i>Brutal hit!</i>

37:46.302 --> 37:48.511
<i>Vince Howard is down.
Oh, my!</i>

37:48.680 --> 37:51.222
<i>- I can't believe he's getting up.
- 24-power!</i>

37:51.391 --> 37:53.724
Keep you focus, alright?
Get him out there.

37:53.893 --> 37:56.018
Keep focus, gentlemen.
Let's go!

37:56.427 --> 37:59.313
24-power, on one.
Ready?

38:00.412 --> 38:03.425
<i>This is it, folks.
Olsen bringing the Lions to the line.</i>

38:03.837 --> 38:04.841
Set!

38:06.157 --> 38:09.052
<i>There's the snap. Oh, my!
I think that went right through.</i>

38:09.177 --> 38:11.408
<i>- What are you doing?
- Fumble!</i>

38:11.784 --> 38:15.412
<i>The first play from scrimmage,
we are not off to a pretty start here.</i>

38:15.580 --> 38:16.883
Come on, now!

38:17.008 --> 38:19.818
<i>Olsen opens left.
Quick toss to Howard.</i>

38:19.943 --> 38:23.100
<i>Trying to get to the outside,
he's got nowhere to go.</i>

38:27.300 --> 38:28.509
Don't give me that!

38:28.678 --> 38:31.011
<i>Vince Howard gets drilled
to the backfield.</i>

38:31.393 --> 38:33.685
<i>He got decimated
on that play, folks.</i>

38:35.964 --> 38:37.101
Shut up!

38:37.270 --> 38:38.686
Barracuda right trips.

38:38.855 --> 38:40.782
What? That's not the play.

38:42.581 --> 38:46.569
- Oklahoma right trip.
- Oklahoma right! Ready?

38:47.409 --> 38:49.863
<i>Olsen back to pass.
Pressure coming!</i>

38:52.044 --> 38:54.059
<i>- Olsen goes down hard.
- What is that?</i>

38:54.369 --> 38:56.912
- Why is that?
- Come on, open your eye!

38:58.008 --> 39:01.083
<i>South King on the speed's way,
he's got the outside.</i>

39:01.252 --> 39:04.309
<i>Fantastic blocking.
He could go, folks.</i>

39:05.046 --> 39:06.505
<i>Here we go!</i>

39:06.674 --> 39:09.008
<i>Touchdown, South King.</i>

39:09.177 --> 39:12.803
Someone to get him off the field?
Get him off the field!

39:12.971 --> 39:15.293
<i>Late in second quarter,
South King back to pass.</i>

39:15.418 --> 39:20.144
<i>He's got a man. Reservation for six.
Another South King touchdown.</i>

39:20.462 --> 39:23.564
Alright. Come on, guys.
28-bounce.

39:24.068 --> 39:25.566
28-bound!

39:25.735 --> 39:28.402
- Can't even feel my arms, man.
- We need you!

39:29.613 --> 39:32.434
28-bounce, on one. Ready?

39:33.742 --> 39:35.951
<i>Olsen back to pass.
They need something here.</i>

39:36.501 --> 39:39.413
<i>Across the middle.
Oh, it's picked up by South King!</i>

39:40.874 --> 39:44.126
<i>He's got a lane to the outside.
Howard's got an angle.</i>

39:45.406 --> 39:47.296
<i>And Vince Howard is cracked</i>

39:47.465 --> 39:50.174
<i>at the 40, and another
South King touchdown.</i>

40:02.729 --> 40:05.105
<i>This is getting
flat out ugly, folks.</i>

40:05.531 --> 40:08.506
<i>Coach Taylor is known for his
remarkable half-time adjustments,</i>

40:08.631 --> 40:11.105
<i>but I don't know if there is
an adjustment to this.</i>

40:11.230 --> 40:15.221
<i>This is as bad as anything
I have ever seen on a football field.</i>

40:16.993 --> 40:18.577
Can you flex it for me?

40:20.452 --> 40:21.997
We'll unwrap it.

40:27.337 --> 40:29.286
Easy, just relax.

40:30.127 --> 40:31.632
I can't stop it from twitching.

40:42.750 --> 40:45.979
He didn't break it, but he's got
a hell of a high ankle sprain.

40:46.484 --> 40:48.750
Tell him.
Tell him I'll still go.

40:49.400 --> 40:51.186
Alright, we'll tape it and see.

40:51.635 --> 40:53.570
- I can play.
- I hear you.

40:55.824 --> 40:58.200
- What you got? Let me see.
- Stitches.

40:58.369 --> 41:00.147
He didn't say anything.

41:03.984 --> 41:05.207
How you doing?

41:05.778 --> 41:06.708
I'm solid.

41:10.956 --> 41:12.466
- You alright?
- Yes, sir.

41:12.591 --> 41:14.732
- What you got?
- Nothing, just...

41:16.636 --> 41:19.229
- Does this hurt?
- I think it's alright.

41:39.682 --> 41:41.794
Hey, Coach,
you got a few more minutes.

41:47.950 --> 41:49.209
We gotta call the game.

41:49.603 --> 41:52.384
- What?
- I said we gotta call the game.

41:53.589 --> 41:56.179
- Are you sure...
- Yeah, I gotta call the end game.

41:56.647 --> 41:58.844
- Just like that?
- You want a dissertation?

41:59.013 --> 42:00.929
- I understand you're upset.
- Fine.

42:01.298 --> 42:03.723
We would like to forfeit the game,
how does that sound?

42:11.084 --> 42:12.399
Game is over.

42:12.835 --> 42:15.977
Dillon has forfeited,
South King has won.
