12:14.374 --> 12:16.621
Yeah, and that someone was
not playing either.

12:16.669 --> 12:18.029
Yeah, we heard about it.

12:18.115 --> 12:20.234
- So any witnesses?
- No, sir, nothing.

12:20.268 --> 12:22.736
We confirmed this is where
Miguel and Eduardo live.

12:22.771 --> 12:24.839
Our friends live in that house.

12:24.873 --> 12:26.507
We just want to know if they're okay.

12:26.541 --> 12:29.810
- It's our legal right.
- I'm sorry, let them in.

12:29.845 --> 12:31.011
It's your legal right, huh?

12:31.046 --> 12:32.746
Where'd you learn that, law school?

12:32.781 --> 12:34.448
We just want to know what happened.

12:34.482 --> 12:37.551
I'm happy to talk about it... with Peña.

12:40.288 --> 12:43.858
You tell him Hank Voight wants
to see him in one hour.

12:43.892 --> 12:46.493
All right. All right.

12:50.665 --> 12:52.833
Okay, they're dead.

12:52.868 --> 12:54.268
So who did the murders?

12:54.302 --> 12:56.203
Well, I was hoping you could tell me.

12:56.238 --> 12:58.172
I mean, the way these kids were killed

12:58.206 --> 13:00.400
it was obviously personal.

13:00.433 --> 13:02.713
Certain male body parts were severed.

13:02.745 --> 13:06.214
- What you sayin'? That they...
- That's what I'm saying.

13:06.264 --> 13:07.865
Damn.

13:07.940 --> 13:11.576
I'd hate to go out like that, huh?

13:11.611 --> 13:14.412
- Caught these kids snitching?
- Nah.

13:14.447 --> 13:15.780
They didn't know enough to snitch.

13:15.815 --> 13:17.449
Hm.

13:17.483 --> 13:18.683
Well, you're at war with someone?

13:18.718 --> 13:20.519
We don't do wars, socio.

13:20.553 --> 13:23.255
It's bad for business.

13:23.289 --> 13:24.956
Yeah, but, uh,

13:24.991 --> 13:27.659
but raping and killing little girls,

13:27.693 --> 13:30.462
- that's good?
- I didn't say that.

13:31.831 --> 13:36.601
But if you want to own
a neighborhood or a territory,

13:36.636 --> 13:38.970
you got to break its soul first.

13:40.640 --> 13:42.073
Hm.

13:51.017 --> 13:53.585
Call your CI, get
that deal back on track.

13:53.619 --> 13:55.987
I want to bury this son of a bitch.

13:56.022 --> 13:57.255
No.

13:59.025 --> 14:01.292
I want to break his soul.

14:05.331 --> 14:09.768
Yo, yo, so we talked to CIs,
Gang Intel, bangers.

14:09.802 --> 14:11.403
There are no conflicts
with the King crew,

14:11.437 --> 14:12.737
at least not right now.

14:12.772 --> 14:15.240
Which means these two punk rapists...

14:15.274 --> 14:16.675
Sorry, victims,

14:16.709 --> 14:18.009
were probably killed by somebody

14:18.044 --> 14:19.911
connected to Daniella or Tina.

14:19.945 --> 14:22.614
- You know, the real victims.
- Sure feels like revenge.

14:22.648 --> 14:23.915
Yeah, looked like it too.

14:23.949 --> 14:25.917
Okay, so circle back with the family.

14:25.951 --> 14:27.652
There's got to be a brother, an uncle,

14:27.687 --> 14:29.320
somebody out there
capable of doing this.

14:29.355 --> 14:31.856
I wish my sister had someone
like that in her life.

14:31.891 --> 14:33.758
Would have made things a lot easier.

14:35.394 --> 14:36.861
I get it.

14:36.896 --> 14:39.431
Just keep your head straight, okay?

14:39.465 --> 14:41.766
Got a double homicide to clear.

14:43.369 --> 14:46.671
For the tenth time,
I didn't tell anyone, okay?

14:46.706 --> 14:48.807
So please, leave me alone.

14:48.841 --> 14:51.776
I just want to move on
and forget this ever happened.

14:51.811 --> 14:55.013
Yeah, I know, but it's not that easy.

14:55.047 --> 14:58.316
Because the two men
who hurt you are dead.

14:58.350 --> 15:00.151
Someone killed them.

15:01.320 --> 15:03.621
Tina, you are the only one
who knows what happened.

15:03.656 --> 15:06.891
You saw the faces of these two punks.

15:06.926 --> 15:08.793
So either you did it

15:08.828 --> 15:10.328
or they told somebody and they did it.

15:10.362 --> 15:12.197
I didn't kill them.

15:12.231 --> 15:14.833
Okay? I would never.
That's... that's ridiculous.

15:14.867 --> 15:16.901
I believe you. I do.

15:16.936 --> 15:19.003
But I think maybe you told someone.

15:19.038 --> 15:20.839
- Like your mom?
- My mom?

15:20.873 --> 15:22.540
- Sure.
- Please.

15:22.575 --> 15:25.143
She's got enough problems, trust me.

15:29.381 --> 15:31.983
That's a sweet picture. Who is that?

15:32.017 --> 15:35.653
That's Dante. My boyfriend.

15:35.688 --> 15:37.689
You didn't tell Dante?

15:38.524 --> 15:40.391
No. No way.

15:40.860 --> 15:43.862
Why? Is he violent?

15:43.896 --> 15:45.897
Because I love him.

15:45.931 --> 15:48.366
And I would never want him
to know that someone...

15:48.400 --> 15:49.667
I understand that.

15:49.702 --> 15:52.504
But we do need to talk to Dante.

15:52.538 --> 15:54.839
Could you tell us where he is?

15:54.874 --> 15:57.876
At J&P Metals. He works there.

15:57.910 --> 16:00.011
Don't tell him what happened.

16:00.045 --> 16:04.816
Please, he'd never look at me the same.

16:12.625 --> 16:15.527
- Dante Silva?
- Chicago PD.

16:15.561 --> 16:18.563
We want to talk to you
about your girlfriend, Tina.

16:18.597 --> 16:20.098
Why? Something happen to her?

16:20.132 --> 16:22.367
- Yes, yesterday she was...
- Her best friend, Danni,

16:22.401 --> 16:25.737
was sexually assaulted, murdered.

16:25.771 --> 16:27.372
Yeah, I know.

16:27.406 --> 16:29.274
What's that got to do with Tina?

16:29.308 --> 16:32.243
The two guys that killed
Danni, they wound up dead.

16:32.278 --> 16:36.080
Killer made a real statement
by cutting off their... you know.

16:36.816 --> 16:39.217
Good.

16:39.251 --> 16:41.386
Ask me, we should tell
the whole city what happened

16:41.420 --> 16:44.789
to those dudes and that other
bitch-ass rapist, too.

16:45.691 --> 16:47.425
What other bitch-ass rapist?

16:47.459 --> 16:49.427
Some janitor.

16:49.461 --> 16:51.596
Lakeside High.

16:51.630 --> 16:53.731
Heard he raped a girl.

16:53.766 --> 16:55.900
He got dealt with too.

16:56.802 --> 16:59.337
That's all I know.

16:59.371 --> 17:02.273
- I got to get back to work.
- Yeah.

17:03.943 --> 17:06.978
You guys... You guys scared me.

17:07.012 --> 17:08.413
Coming in with those badges,

17:08.446 --> 17:11.482
I thought something
bad happened to Tina.

17:11.517 --> 17:13.284
No.

17:16.121 --> 17:17.255
Mm-mm.

17:17.289 --> 17:19.656
Either he's the best actor alive

17:19.692 --> 17:22.292
or he has no clue Tina got raped.

17:23.295 --> 17:25.296
We found the DOA, Mark Whitmore,

17:25.330 --> 17:29.000
in a garbage bin two blocks
from his house in Wilmette.

17:29.034 --> 17:31.936
Gunshot wound to the chest
and he'd been castrated.

17:31.971 --> 17:34.138
Wilmette, but he works
in Little Village, right?

17:34.173 --> 17:35.206
- Lakeside High?
- Yeah.

17:35.241 --> 17:36.808
He was a maintenance worker.

17:36.842 --> 17:38.276
Did he have any sexual assault priors?

17:38.310 --> 17:41.512
Two. Lot of nasty rumors
swirling around as well.

17:41.547 --> 17:42.947
- Why?
- Because we found

17:42.982 --> 17:45.450
two other bodies
in Little Village, same M.O.

17:45.484 --> 17:47.218
So we're probably looking
for the same guy.

17:47.253 --> 17:49.954
The only lead we got is
the DOA said some gangbanger

17:49.989 --> 17:51.456
was threatening him.

17:51.490 --> 17:53.625
We told him to come in,
file an official report,

17:53.659 --> 17:54.959
but he got killed the next day.

17:54.994 --> 17:56.194
Do you have this gangbanger's name?

17:56.228 --> 17:58.496
Only his nickname: Q.

18:01.233 --> 18:03.701
- Any word back from your CI?
- Yeah.

18:03.736 --> 18:05.069
The deal is on ice for now.

18:05.104 --> 18:06.638
Kings are on high-alert.

18:06.672 --> 18:09.474
Those two pledges getting
whacked made them nervous.

18:09.508 --> 18:11.910
We got any intel on this gangbanger Q?

18:11.944 --> 18:15.046
Yeah, Sarge, his name came up
on the wire a few days ago.

18:15.080 --> 18:17.081
Exact quote was
"Have Q deliver the guns.

18:17.116 --> 18:19.651
Drop off at the pool hall
on 22nd. Usual price."

18:19.685 --> 18:21.386
I'm assuming that's somewhere
in Little Village?

18:21.420 --> 18:23.855
There's this place called
Kedzie Billiards on 22nd.

18:23.889 --> 18:25.390
Could be Q's hangout.

18:25.424 --> 18:28.726
All right, check it out, you two.

18:28.761 --> 18:31.529
[ROCK MUSIC]

18:31.563 --> 18:33.831
CPD. We're looking for a guy named Q.

18:33.866 --> 18:35.433
[CHUCKLES]

18:35.467 --> 18:37.335
- Something funny?
- No, I'm just happy.

18:37.369 --> 18:39.003
There's no law against that, is there?

18:39.038 --> 18:40.939
No, but there's a law
against lying to the cops

18:40.973 --> 18:43.207
so maybe you want to rethink
your answer.

18:43.242 --> 18:47.378
I swear to God on my mother
I don't know a man named Q.

18:47.413 --> 18:49.080
Uh-huh.

19:03.395 --> 19:05.129
Excuse me.

19:05.164 --> 19:06.698
We're looking for someone named Q.

19:06.732 --> 19:08.232
Maybe you could help us out?

19:08.267 --> 19:10.435
Don't know no one by that name.

19:10.469 --> 19:13.237
Really? What's that on your arm?

19:16.508 --> 19:18.543
We're gonna need to take you
down to the District,

19:18.577 --> 19:19.711
ask you a few questions.

19:19.745 --> 19:21.145
About what?

19:21.180 --> 19:23.281
Three dead rapists.

19:33.317 --> 19:34.984
Do you know Miguel Salazar?

19:35.018 --> 19:36.852
- No.
- Hmm.

19:36.887 --> 19:38.934
What about Eduardo Vargas?

19:38.989 --> 19:40.823
- Mm-mm.
- These two fine gentlemen

19:40.858 --> 19:42.358
sexually assaulted two girls.

19:42.393 --> 19:45.828
Killed one. The other one got away.

19:45.863 --> 19:47.697
What's that got to do with me?

19:47.731 --> 19:50.967
We just want to know
if you know these two guys.

19:51.001 --> 19:52.268
Two rapists.

19:52.303 --> 19:55.305
And I already told you no.

19:55.339 --> 19:58.875
What about Tina Vasquez? You know her?

19:58.909 --> 20:00.343
Mm-mm.

20:00.377 --> 20:02.645
See, she only lives
a few blocks from you.

20:02.680 --> 20:05.748
Lots of folks live a few blocks from me.

20:20.364 --> 20:23.666
Most people cringe
at something like that.

20:23.701 --> 20:25.568
I ain't most people.

20:25.603 --> 20:27.370
Yeah.

20:27.404 --> 20:29.739
You're not.

20:29.773 --> 20:31.841
You're tougher.

20:31.875 --> 20:34.043
More fearless.

20:36.247 --> 20:38.982
'Cause you stand up for your friends.

20:39.016 --> 20:42.518
For women, for young girls.

20:42.553 --> 20:44.754
And then when someone commits
a rape, you kill 'em

20:44.788 --> 20:46.556
and you castrate them.

20:50.461 --> 20:53.162
You ask me, you deserve a trophy.

20:55.099 --> 20:57.800
But that's not the way the world works.

21:02.273 --> 21:04.274
You done?

21:04.308 --> 21:06.175
Can I go now?

21:10.062 --> 21:13.547
Isabel Torres, street name Q.
Short for Queen.

21:13.609 --> 21:15.944
Long rap sheet: drugs,
larceny, aggravated assault.

21:15.978 --> 21:18.313
She runs an all-female gang
called the Viper Queens,

21:18.348 --> 21:19.948
but for the most part,
they're a delivery service

21:19.982 --> 21:22.213
- for the local male gangs.
- Yeah, woman behind the wheel

21:22.238 --> 21:24.830
lowers the risk of arrest
by 50%, maybe 60%.

21:24.855 --> 21:27.025
Yeah, because like it or not,
we're all biased.

21:27.050 --> 21:28.623
We don't profile women as criminals.

21:28.658 --> 21:30.656
They're not strong enough,
they're not tough enough.

21:30.681 --> 21:32.400
That's a little bit of an overstatement.

21:32.448 --> 21:33.649
Really?

21:33.675 --> 21:35.075
Because we never used "her" or "she"

21:35.118 --> 21:36.952
when talking about suspects
in this case.

21:36.986 --> 21:39.154
It was "he" and "him" from the jump.

21:39.188 --> 21:42.591
- She kind of makes a point.
- Okay, enough.

21:42.625 --> 21:43.992
We got homicides to solve.

21:44.027 --> 21:46.094
Right now, we got a whole lot
of nothing.

21:46.129 --> 21:47.955
No physical evidence, no forensics.

21:48.017 --> 21:50.474
So dig into these rape victims.

21:50.509 --> 21:53.311
Find the connection
with this female banger Q.

21:53.345 --> 21:54.912
Rest of you, canvas the neighborhood

21:54.946 --> 21:56.314
where the bangers got popped.

21:56.348 --> 21:58.249
Show photos of them, Q.

21:58.283 --> 22:00.929
Maybe someone saw them together
near the time of the murders.

22:00.954 --> 22:03.272
Hey, Sarge, I'm looking
at this M.E. report,

22:03.297 --> 22:05.022
and based on stomach contents,
it looks like

22:05.047 --> 22:07.335
the last thing the Kings
had to eat was pizza.

22:07.360 --> 22:08.593
So you should let me and Ruzek

22:08.628 --> 22:09.687
check out some local restaurants.

22:09.712 --> 22:12.881
Well, there's a good place to start.

22:14.599 --> 22:16.366
Yeah, I've seen him before.

22:16.440 --> 22:18.741
They come here a lot. One of them...

22:18.766 --> 22:20.267
That one.

22:20.292 --> 22:21.983
- Hmm?
- Owes me $5.

22:22.008 --> 22:24.142
You might want to write
that off as uncollectible.

22:24.177 --> 22:26.617
- He's dead.
- Yeah, they both are.

22:26.704 --> 22:28.972
- They were just here.
- Were they with her?

22:29.006 --> 22:30.707
No.

22:30.741 --> 22:33.577
But they were with a girl.
She was real pretty, too.

22:33.611 --> 22:35.178
All right, can you describe her for me?

22:35.212 --> 22:37.314
Uh, she's Latina.

22:37.348 --> 22:39.349
Blondish hair. Curly.

22:39.383 --> 22:42.986
She was thin but not too thin
if you know what I mean.

22:43.020 --> 22:44.354
Sure, keep going.

22:44.388 --> 22:46.089
She was medium height.

22:46.123 --> 22:48.858
And she had real pretty brown eyes.

22:48.893 --> 22:50.827
- She sounds fine as hell.
- Yeah.

22:50.861 --> 22:52.996
But I didn't want to sound
like a creeper, you know?

22:53.030 --> 22:55.432
- Oh, yeah.
- All right, hey, listen.

22:55.466 --> 22:57.734
