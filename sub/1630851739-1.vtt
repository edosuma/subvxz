00:27.666 --> 00:29.041
<i>In theory,</i>

00:29.125 --> 00:31.291
<i>exercising produces endorphins.</i>

00:31.375 --> 00:34.791
<i>It makes you forget
unpleasant things temporarily.</i>

00:36.208 --> 00:37.583
<i>But that day,</i>

00:37.666 --> 00:39.791
<i>no matter how much I ran,</i>

00:39.875 --> 00:42.125
<i>the endorphins did not have any effects.</i>

00:43.833 --> 00:45.208
<i>Because I know,</i>

00:46.125 --> 00:47.791
<i>from that day onward,</i>

00:48.625 --> 00:52.041
<i>the normal life of my family and I</i>

00:52.916 --> 00:55.166
<i>will never return.</i>

01:18.708 --> 01:19.791
Sung Yuan-yuan.

01:19.875 --> 01:20.958
What are you doing?

01:21.041 --> 01:22.208
I'm sorry.

01:22.291 --> 01:23.666
I'll buy you a beverage.

01:32.291 --> 01:33.250
What--

01:34.708 --> 01:36.041
What is this?

01:42.958 --> 01:44.791
Let's go to the Student Affairs Office.

01:44.875 --> 01:45.708
No.

01:45.791 --> 01:47.750
Sir, it wasn't me.

01:47.833 --> 01:50.333
<i>Maybe Sung Yuan-yuan came to comfort me</i>

01:51.041 --> 01:53.791
<i>-in her own way that no one understands.</i>
-It's not me.

01:53.875 --> 01:56.000
<i>At that moment, it made me feel</i>

01:56.083 --> 01:58.791
<i>that this world's sadness
has nothing to do with me.</i>

02:00.000 --> 02:02.791
<i>And I only realized it much later</i>

02:04.958 --> 02:07.333
<i>that on the worst day of my life,</i>

02:07.416 --> 02:10.083
<i>I met the person I love the most.</i>

02:22.750 --> 02:24.625
It's really idiotic!

02:42.666 --> 02:44.333
Chang Che-kai!

02:49.291 --> 02:50.333
<i>But I wasn't able</i>

02:52.250 --> 02:53.708
<i>to tell her.</i>

03:00.625 --> 03:04.958
THE DIARY

03:21.208 --> 03:23.791
-What can we do? Now…
-No choice…

03:25.708 --> 03:26.791
Where's An-an?

03:26.875 --> 03:28.583
An-an is still having a meeting upstairs.

03:28.666 --> 03:29.750
-Is it the demo?
-Yes.

03:29.833 --> 03:31.625
-Just place them on the table.
-Okay.

03:57.416 --> 03:58.583
Not bad.

03:59.583 --> 04:00.750
However,

04:00.833 --> 04:03.000
as a title track,

04:03.708 --> 04:05.208
I don't think it's enough.

04:08.166 --> 04:09.875
What do you think the problem is?

04:09.958 --> 04:12.166
You know I want something

04:12.250 --> 04:13.541
that moves people

04:13.625 --> 04:16.041
once you sing it.

04:16.125 --> 04:18.333
Or we can try changing the direction?

04:18.416 --> 04:19.708
Well…

04:19.791 --> 04:22.000
We actually receive a lot
of new songs' demos.

04:22.083 --> 04:24.083
And I have a box full of them on my table.

04:24.166 --> 04:25.500
We received a lot via email too.

04:25.583 --> 04:27.000
I'm sure there are good songs.

04:27.083 --> 04:28.791
So you're saying

04:28.875 --> 04:30.791
that the song I made just for A-Lin

04:30.875 --> 04:32.541
can't compare to those
that idle people made.

04:32.625 --> 04:34.083
Po-han,

04:34.166 --> 04:36.750
this is my first concept album.

04:37.333 --> 04:41.000
So we must try everything we can.

04:41.750 --> 04:43.458
Excuse me. Let me take a call.

04:44.166 --> 04:45.208
An-an,

04:45.291 --> 04:46.625
are there suitable songs then?

04:46.708 --> 04:47.875
LI-NA: I'LL MAKE YOU REGRET THIS.

04:47.958 --> 04:49.750
I haven't heard anything suitable yet.

04:49.833 --> 04:51.291
But a few days ago,

04:51.375 --> 04:53.583
Po-han spoke with famous composers
from Korea and Japan too.

04:53.666 --> 04:55.583
We should get a response in a few days.

04:55.666 --> 04:57.583
Isn't that right, Po-han?

04:58.708 --> 04:59.666
How about this?

04:59.750 --> 05:03.500
Ya-ning, check when
the other demos will come.

05:03.583 --> 05:05.708
Then arrange a time to discuss it.

05:05.791 --> 05:07.583
Is that okay, Po-han?

05:08.208 --> 05:09.041
Po-han.

05:10.625 --> 05:11.833
What's wrong?

05:12.791 --> 05:14.875
A-Lin, I'm sorry.
Something urgent came up.

05:14.958 --> 05:17.041
-That's all for today. I'm sorry.
-What?

05:18.916 --> 05:21.666
An Yi-chi, listen to all the demos today
and report to me tomorrow.

05:21.750 --> 05:22.916
What?

05:32.791 --> 05:35.875
<i>Your call will be forwarded to voicemail.</i>

05:51.791 --> 05:56.083
PO-HAN

06:05.458 --> 06:06.666
Li-na.

06:06.750 --> 06:08.000
Li-na.

06:08.083 --> 06:09.666
Li-na.

06:13.416 --> 06:14.791
"Vitamin A."

06:18.708 --> 06:19.583
SLEEPING PILLS

06:28.416 --> 06:30.750
-You're here.
-Why did you get so many medicines?

06:30.833 --> 06:33.291
I can't sleep without you.

06:33.375 --> 06:34.916
Is it the same for you?

06:36.583 --> 06:39.375
Po-han. Let's start over, okay?

06:39.458 --> 06:41.583
I know you still love me. I…

06:42.666 --> 06:44.125
We already broke up.

06:44.208 --> 06:45.958
But you still came.

06:46.041 --> 06:48.083
It proves that you still can't let me go.

06:48.166 --> 06:49.708
Huang Shu-hui,
will you stop messing around?

06:49.791 --> 06:52.791
Why do you keep calling me by that name?

06:52.875 --> 06:54.416
What's wrong with Huang Shu-hui?

06:55.166 --> 06:57.916
There will be no Kung Li-na now
without Huang Shu-hui's efforts.

06:58.000 --> 06:59.750
Then why don't you want me anymore?

06:59.833 --> 07:01.708
I'm a has-been, and I don't deserve you,

07:01.791 --> 07:03.666
so you don't want me anymore?

07:03.750 --> 07:05.875
You know why we broke up.

07:06.416 --> 07:07.583
We're not compatible.

07:07.666 --> 07:09.166
It's not that we're not compatible.

07:09.250 --> 07:10.541
I never wanted to break up with you.

07:10.625 --> 07:12.125
I can't break up with you.

07:12.708 --> 07:14.083
Stop drinking, okay?

07:15.791 --> 07:18.208
Look in the mirror
and see what you look like.

07:18.291 --> 07:19.416
How old are you already?

07:20.000 --> 07:21.666
How many years can you still waste?

07:22.375 --> 07:24.125
Please get a grip, okay?

07:25.833 --> 07:27.833
Come back, Wang Po-han.

07:27.916 --> 07:29.083
Wang Po-han!

07:47.041 --> 07:48.125
Ke-le.

07:48.208 --> 07:49.541
You're waiting for your sister?

07:49.625 --> 07:50.458
Yes.

07:51.750 --> 07:53.875
Eat up. Eat while waiting.

07:53.958 --> 07:54.875
Here.

07:55.916 --> 07:58.750
Ke-le, it seems like your sister
always picks you up after school.

07:58.833 --> 08:02.041
Doesn't she go on a date
with her boyfriend after work?

08:03.375 --> 08:05.208
She doesn't have a boyfriend.

08:06.416 --> 08:07.833
But you won't do.

08:07.916 --> 08:09.875
I won't let you pursue my sister.

08:09.958 --> 08:11.333
Why?

08:11.416 --> 08:12.958
Because you're a glutton, lazy,

08:13.041 --> 08:15.208
messy, and not motivated.

08:15.291 --> 08:18.166
The point is you don't use your brain.

08:18.250 --> 08:20.500
Hey, why did you give Ke-le
such oily food again?

08:20.583 --> 08:21.666
I'm sorry.

08:21.750 --> 08:23.625
Sorry, I'm late.

08:23.708 --> 08:25.333
-It's fine.
-You looked after him for a long time.

08:25.416 --> 08:26.500
-I'm sorry.
-It's what we should do.

08:26.583 --> 08:28.416
As Ke-le's sister, don't be shy.

08:28.500 --> 08:31.125
Just tell me if you're busy next time.
I can take Ke-le home.

08:31.208 --> 08:33.166
-Don't listen to Ke-le.
-Let's go.

08:33.250 --> 08:34.250
-Actually, I'm--
-Let's go.

08:34.333 --> 08:36.083
-I'm sorry, I'll get going.
-Take care.

08:36.166 --> 08:37.041
Bye.

08:37.125 --> 08:39.541
An Ke-le, why are you talking nonsense?

08:39.625 --> 08:41.083
Hey, do you really think

08:41.166 --> 08:43.416
that Ms. An is Ke-le's sister?

08:43.500 --> 08:45.791
Who else can she be?
Ke-le said it himself.

08:45.875 --> 08:47.625
Can she be Ke-le's brother?

08:49.208 --> 08:50.041
-Are you hungry?
-Yes.

08:50.125 --> 08:52.083
-She's Ke-le's mom.
-What do you want to eat?

08:52.166 --> 08:53.125
I don't know.

08:53.208 --> 08:55.750
-Let's eat… Chicken rice?
-Chicken rice.

08:58.875 --> 08:59.833
Mom?

09:10.458 --> 09:12.375
Nothing is too deceitful in this war!

09:13.458 --> 09:15.041
Ke-le, you're dead this time.

09:17.125 --> 09:20.083
Ke-le! That's enough.

09:20.625 --> 09:21.791
What's your rate now?

09:22.416 --> 09:24.333
-Six, I think.
-Six?

09:24.416 --> 09:25.583
Come here.

09:25.666 --> 09:26.750
Here.

09:42.125 --> 09:44.375
-How much is it now?
-Only two now.

09:44.458 --> 09:46.041
Very good.

09:46.125 --> 09:47.291
Have you done your homework?

09:47.375 --> 09:48.416
I finished them long ago.

09:48.500 --> 09:50.708
Today's last class was PE.
They did a running test.

09:50.791 --> 09:52.333
I finished them early.

09:52.416 --> 09:54.041
You're so smart.

09:54.125 --> 09:56.083
That's my boy.

09:56.166 --> 09:57.083
Come on.

09:57.166 --> 09:59.291
Go to bed. Take your toy inside.

10:00.958 --> 10:02.166
Aren't you going to sleep?

10:02.250 --> 10:05.041
I can't. I've got work to do.

10:05.125 --> 10:07.041
You'll get wrinkles this way.

10:07.666 --> 10:09.916
You're complaining that I'm old?

10:10.000 --> 10:11.291
Go to sleep.

10:12.708 --> 10:14.083
Come here.

10:18.333 --> 10:19.333
Go.

10:19.416 --> 10:21.166
-Remember to take your medicine.
-Okay.

10:30.791 --> 10:33.958
AN KE-LE, MALE

11:00.625 --> 11:02.250
What is this?

12:13.750 --> 12:15.875
<i>You didn't take away</i>

12:16.833 --> 12:20.625
<i>All my longing</i>

12:20.708 --> 12:23.750
<i>Please return my apologies</i>

12:23.833 --> 12:27.000
<i>And hate me</i>

12:28.458 --> 12:30.958
<i>A complete story</i>

12:31.041 --> 12:32.333
<i>In an incomplete circle…</i>

12:32.416 --> 12:34.375
Who sent this song?

12:35.333 --> 12:36.541
I don't know either.

12:36.625 --> 12:38.916
Nothing is written on this envelope.

12:39.000 --> 12:40.666
But the CD says,

12:40.750 --> 12:43.041
"Lyrics by Cream, Music by K."

12:43.958 --> 12:46.083
Po-han said that he knows them both.

12:46.166 --> 12:47.958
You know them?

12:48.791 --> 12:50.166
K is Chang Che-kai.

12:50.250 --> 12:51.583
Cream is Sung Yuan-yuan.

12:52.208 --> 12:54.583
K was my colleague at Pop Hit.

12:55.083 --> 12:57.583
I was the guy they hired
to replace him in Pop Hit.

12:57.666 --> 12:58.875
Che-kai.

12:58.958 --> 13:01.708
-Mr. Chi.
-Let me introduce you to him. He's…

13:01.791 --> 13:03.666
Wang Han-po.

13:03.750 --> 13:06.500
Mr. Chi, I'm sorry. It's Wang Po-han.

13:07.416 --> 13:09.250
It's the same.

13:09.333 --> 13:10.750
Anyway, for the next two weeks,

13:10.833 --> 13:12.750
turn over your work to him.

13:13.375 --> 13:14.458
Hello.

13:15.208 --> 13:17.916
Are you sure you won't reconsider?

13:18.000 --> 13:19.416
I'm sorry, Mr. Chi.

13:20.083 --> 13:22.750
I really want to take some time off.

13:24.083 --> 13:25.250
<i>However,</i>

13:25.333 --> 13:27.458
<i>he passed away three years ago.</i>

13:28.041 --> 13:29.166
<i>How did he die?</i>

13:29.750 --> 13:30.958
Leukemia.

13:31.458 --> 13:33.125
He's a few years younger than me.

13:33.666 --> 13:35.291
He died very young.

13:35.875 --> 13:37.666
What about Cream?

13:38.250 --> 13:40.416
Cream is a contractual songwriter
for Pop Hit.

13:40.500 --> 13:42.708
I think she sang this demo.

13:43.625 --> 13:45.583
I've never met her either.

13:45.666 --> 13:48.625
But I heard that she passed away too.

13:48.708 --> 13:51.583
I also heard that she was really upset,

13:51.666 --> 13:53.000
so…

13:53.916 --> 13:57.250
So K and Cream were a couple?

13:57.333 --> 13:58.833
I don't think so.

13:58.916 --> 14:01.083
But I'm not really sure.

14:01.875 --> 14:02.958
It's okay.

14:03.041 --> 14:05.250
I want this song.
I want it to be the title track.

14:06.000 --> 14:07.041
Okay.

14:09.500 --> 14:10.750
However,

14:10.833 --> 14:12.958
where is the copyright of this song now?

14:26.958 --> 14:29.125
Isn't this Bonnie, the Catgirl?

14:29.208 --> 14:31.375
Her song "Love Me, Meow Meow Meow"
is so catchy.

14:31.458 --> 14:34.625
<i>Meow, meow, meow, meow, love me
Meow, meow, meow</i>

14:34.708 --> 14:35.916
Po-han,

14:36.000 --> 14:37.875
why do you look so tired today?

14:37.958 --> 14:38.791
I'm fine.

14:38.875 --> 14:40.416
Mr. Chi is not here today.

14:41.000 --> 14:43.333
-Who's Mr. Chi?
-He's our boss.

14:43.416 --> 14:45.583
When Po-han left the company
two years ago,

14:45.666 --> 14:47.541
-they were on very bad terms.
-Pang.

14:47.625 --> 14:49.291
Did you check what I asked you to do?

14:49.375 --> 14:51.500
Yes. Take a look.

14:52.041 --> 14:55.750
This is the list of the songs K wrote
at our company in the past.

14:55.833 --> 14:57.458
I already checked.

14:57.541 --> 14:59.833
The song you're looking for isn't listed.

15:02.625 --> 15:05.458
However, some of K's belongings

15:05.541 --> 15:07.625
were given to a photographer
named Yu Chen-hsi.

15:07.708 --> 15:08.583
This one.

15:11.291 --> 15:13.583
It's a photo exhibition she held for K.

15:18.083 --> 15:19.791
Make your gaze colder.

15:20.458 --> 15:21.416
Colder.

15:22.708 --> 15:23.750
Colder.

15:24.750 --> 15:25.708
Change your pose.

15:27.416 --> 15:28.250
Change it again.

15:29.208 --> 15:30.541
Change it.

15:30.625 --> 15:31.583
Don't pout.

15:34.291 --> 15:36.083
I think the ones before were all great.

15:36.166 --> 15:37.708
Do you want to take a look first?

15:37.791 --> 15:38.916
Chen Hsiao-kuai.

15:39.583 --> 15:41.541
-Yes.
-Where did you get this model?

15:42.666 --> 15:45.208
Cindy, our client wants her.

15:45.291 --> 15:46.583
What are you waiting for?

15:47.625 --> 15:49.000
Go and show her how to do it.

15:49.083 --> 15:50.791
-Me?
-Go.

15:52.791 --> 15:54.000
I need to borrow this.

15:55.583 --> 15:56.625
Thank you.

16:01.041 --> 16:02.000
Change.

16:04.333 --> 16:05.333
Change again.

16:07.208 --> 16:08.208
Again.

16:11.916 --> 16:13.666
Look at my assistant's poses.

16:13.750 --> 16:15.458
Are they different from yours?

16:15.541 --> 16:17.625
Hers is ugly enough.

16:17.708 --> 16:19.833
You're just wearing thicker makeup.

16:19.916 --> 16:22.208
Why do I need you
if you're just the same as her?

16:23.000 --> 16:24.541
I can just take photos of her.

16:24.625 --> 16:26.708
Tell the client
to either change the model or forget it.

16:26.791 --> 16:27.791
All right.

16:39.041 --> 16:41.208
-Who are you looking for?
-Is Ms. Yu here?

16:41.291 --> 16:42.333
I am her.

16:45.291 --> 16:47.541
<i>Don't look back</i>

16:47.625 --> 16:51.583
<i>Whenever you owe me again…</i>

16:51.666 --> 16:53.083
I've never heard of this before.

16:58.625 --> 16:59.750
Ms. Yu.

16:59.833 --> 17:01.250
We heard

17:01.333 --> 17:03.416
that you have some of K's belongings?

17:03.500 --> 17:04.416
Yes.

17:05.583 --> 17:07.166
So you were K's friend?

17:07.250 --> 17:08.916
I had no relationship with him.

17:09.000 --> 17:10.750
I only have his belongings
for the exhibition.

17:11.333 --> 17:12.916
Among K's belongings,

17:13.000 --> 17:15.958
was there a copyright
transfer agreement or the like?

17:16.041 --> 17:17.458
No.

17:17.541 --> 17:19.125
If there is, I'd surely know.

17:19.833 --> 17:22.041
He just left some daily items with me.

17:23.291 --> 17:26.666
Would it be convenient for you
to let us see his belongings?

17:26.750 --> 17:28.916
We might find some clues.

17:33.083 --> 17:34.541
I'm sorry, it's not convenient.

17:35.375 --> 17:36.708
I'm busy.

17:36.791 --> 17:38.166
I won't see you out. Hsiao-kuai.

17:38.750 --> 17:40.125
-I'm coming.
-I'm sorry, Ms. Yu.

17:40.208 --> 17:43.375
We know you're very busy.
But can we trouble you just for a moment?

17:43.458 --> 17:44.708
Just for a little while.

17:44.791 --> 17:46.375
I said it's not convenient.

17:46.458 --> 17:47.583
See them out.

17:47.666 --> 17:49.666
Okay. I'm sorry, this way.

17:51.166 --> 17:52.333
This way, please.

17:59.791 --> 18:00.750
<i>Why did you choose a song</i>

18:00.833 --> 18:03.000
that we can't find the copyright for?

18:04.958 --> 18:07.000
Smoking is bad for your health.

18:08.166 --> 18:09.291
What did you say?

18:09.875 --> 18:13.333
Smoking is bad for my health.

18:13.416 --> 18:15.416
You made such a big mistake at work

18:15.500 --> 18:17.458
and you're still talking about health.

18:17.541 --> 18:18.916
Why don't you think

18:19.000 --> 18:20.875
about who'll take responsibility

18:20.958 --> 18:22.875
if we don't find the copyright in the end

18:22.958 --> 18:24.916
and A-Lin insists on using this song,

18:25.000 --> 18:26.583
and the entire album can't be produced

18:26.666 --> 18:27.625
because of this song?

18:28.208 --> 18:29.500
But this song is really good.

18:29.583 --> 18:31.083
You heard it too.

18:31.666 --> 18:34.625
I think there's something fishy
since Cindy reacted that way.

18:34.708 --> 18:36.416
Maybe she really does have it.

18:36.916 --> 18:38.333
We can talk to her

18:38.416 --> 18:39.500
and make a deal with her.

18:39.583 --> 18:43.500
Or let's just buy K's copyright directly.

18:43.583 --> 18:45.750
You saw her earlier.

18:45.833 --> 18:48.458
Even if she sells it to us,
how much do you think she'd ask for?

18:49.291 --> 18:52.041
If she knows that A-Lin is singing it,
how much more will she ask for?

18:53.541 --> 18:55.458
Listen, you're the one who started this.

18:55.541 --> 18:56.958
Take care of it yourself.

18:58.375 --> 18:59.791
I don't care what you do.

18:59.875 --> 19:02.125
If I don't see the song tomorrow,
you don't have to come.

19:02.208 --> 19:03.458
Po-han.

19:03.541 --> 19:05.083
Hey!

20:29.208 --> 20:31.500
<i>An Yi-chi, I'm done with my homework.</i>

20:33.000 --> 20:35.500
<i>Great, I'll be home in a bit.</i>

21:47.500 --> 21:50.125
<i>True sorrow is like a song.</i>

21:50.833 --> 21:54.791
<i>It won't make you sad from the start.</i>

21:54.875 --> 21:57.083
<i>But it's the chorus parts</i>

21:57.166 --> 21:59.000
<i>that are like ripples,</i>

21:59.583 --> 22:02.458
<i>repeatedly stacking up
an unforgettable melody.</i>

22:03.958 --> 22:06.333
<i>If you think sorrow came too suddenly,</i>

22:07.416 --> 22:10.958
<i>that's because you kept ignoring
the low notes in the front part.</i>

22:12.583 --> 22:14.458
THAT SONG RECORD STORE

22:14.541 --> 22:17.916
<i>As a high school student that is
about to take the college entrance exam,</i>

22:18.000 --> 22:19.791
<i>in an important period like this,</i>

22:19.875 --> 22:21.958
<i>I should be studying hard at home.</i>

22:23.000 --> 22:24.208
<i>But today,</i>

22:24.916 --> 22:27.000
<i>I had to leave the house for a reason.</i>

22:27.791 --> 22:28.833
What's wrong?

22:28.916 --> 22:30.125
Are you heartbroken?

22:30.208 --> 22:31.625
You're frowning so much.

22:33.625 --> 22:34.666
Dad.

22:35.833 --> 22:37.625
You don't need these anymore?

22:40.583 --> 22:42.750
If no one wants to listen to these CDs,

22:43.250 --> 22:45.083
the songs will be sad.

22:46.208 --> 22:47.458
I should just give them away.

22:52.458 --> 22:53.916
I want this box.

22:57.791 --> 22:59.541
Leave the guitar to me too.

23:01.333 --> 23:02.333
Hey.

23:03.041 --> 23:04.583
Aren't you taking the exam?

23:05.333 --> 23:07.333
Why are you playing the guitar?

23:08.958 --> 23:10.791
Can't I learn it after the exam?

23:24.583 --> 23:26.083
<i>My dad's leukemia</i>

23:26.166 --> 23:28.291
<i>has been under control these years,</i>

23:29.458 --> 23:31.333
<i>but to let him concentrate
on his treatment,</i>

23:31.833 --> 23:33.625
<i>in my senior year,</i>

23:34.625 --> 23:38.125
<i>we've decided to close down
his treasured record store.</i>

23:56.625 --> 23:57.791
Dad.

23:57.875 --> 23:59.208
Are you okay?

23:59.291 --> 24:00.708
Yes.

24:02.083 --> 24:03.125
Your taste changed?

24:04.041 --> 24:04.875
Yes.

24:05.458 --> 24:06.500
Come on.

24:06.583 --> 24:07.750
I'm sorry.

24:07.833 --> 24:09.458
-You must have waited long.
-No.

24:10.916 --> 24:12.250
Dr. Chen said

24:12.333 --> 24:15.083
that my white blood cell count today
is normal.

24:15.166 --> 24:18.166
-Okay.
-And the medication is very effective.

24:19.583 --> 24:21.666
It's your mom's birthday next month.

24:21.750 --> 24:23.708
I think we should go
and celebrate her birthday.

24:23.791 --> 24:26.500
-Okay. I'll buy the cake then.
-I'll buy the present then.

24:27.083 --> 24:29.083
No. You always buy the wrong thing.

24:29.166 --> 24:30.666
Then you'll get beaten up by her.

24:31.541 --> 24:33.750
Girls hit you because they like you.

24:34.333 --> 24:35.166
Let me tell you.

24:35.250 --> 24:37.458
If you meet a girl in the future
who keeps hitting you,

24:37.541 --> 24:39.875
she's interested in you. Understand?

24:40.791 --> 24:43.083
Liar. You're teaching me
ridiculous things again.

24:44.750 --> 24:48.125
I have a recommended version of the song
you were listening to at the hospital.

24:48.208 --> 24:50.666
-This CD is really good. Let me see.
-Hey. I'll look for it.

24:52.583 --> 24:55.166
Once your exams are over,
I'll teach you to play the guitar.

24:55.250 --> 24:56.333
Okay.

24:57.041 --> 24:58.583
-Did you find it?
-I found it.

24:59.166 --> 25:01.208
-This is it, right?
-Yes, it's this CD.

25:17.041 --> 25:21.208
MAE, BENEDICT GARFIELD

25:49.750 --> 25:50.708
Dad.

25:51.541 --> 25:52.500
Dad.

25:54.208 --> 25:55.291
Dad.

25:56.291 --> 25:58.666
Dad!

26:03.166 --> 26:04.833
Dad!

26:30.875 --> 26:32.416
<i>I really want to know</i>

26:32.500 --> 26:34.375
<i>why God likes to play pranks.</i>

26:35.708 --> 26:37.500
<i>Even though my dad and I</i>

26:37.583 --> 26:39.916
<i>survived this accident,</i>

26:40.000 --> 26:44.041
<i>the people in the other car
had no signs of life.</i>

26:45.708 --> 26:47.208
<i>From that day on,</i>

26:48.041 --> 26:51.500
<i>because it was hard to get rid
of self-blame and guilt,</i>

26:52.500 --> 26:54.708
<i>Dad's condition deteriorated.</i>

26:56.833 --> 26:58.583
<i>And the world</i>

26:58.666 --> 27:01.458
<i>started pushing me
into the loneliest corner.</i>

27:01.541 --> 27:04.666
AFTER HALF A YEAR

27:04.750 --> 27:07.833
<i>Your dad's cancer
is spreading faster than expected.</i>

27:08.666 --> 27:10.708
The medication's effect is limited.

27:11.583 --> 27:13.500
We'll start chemotherapy next.

27:14.666 --> 27:17.000
Once we find a suitable donor,

27:17.083 --> 27:20.458
<i>we'll schedule his bone marrow transplant
as soon as possible.</i>

27:22.041 --> 27:23.041
<i>Doctor.</i>

27:23.125 --> 27:25.166
<i>How much time do we have?</i>

27:26.291 --> 27:27.833
<i>We can only do what we can.</i>

27:53.458 --> 27:55.541
Dad, it's okay.

27:57.791 --> 27:58.916
It's okay.

27:59.750 --> 28:02.708
Back then, since your family's poor,

28:02.791 --> 28:05.791
we agreed to let you pay in installments.

28:05.875 --> 28:07.833
Why are you delaying
that payment again this month?

28:08.541 --> 28:09.875
I'm sorry.

28:09.958 --> 28:12.708
My dad has been having a rough month.

28:13.291 --> 28:15.458
Your dad's illness
can be treated at the hospital.

28:15.541 --> 28:16.958
What about our family?

28:18.000 --> 28:20.041
What about those who are left behind?

28:22.291 --> 28:23.333
I'm sorry.

28:24.500 --> 28:26.291
We'll surely compensate you.

28:26.875 --> 28:29.083
My mom will send the money in a few days.

28:29.166 --> 28:31.791
I really don't want
to say something so wicked.

28:32.375 --> 28:34.833
But your dad took three lives.

28:34.916 --> 28:36.375
He's not in good condition now.

28:36.458 --> 28:37.750
Is it karma?

28:37.833 --> 28:39.250
Think about it yourself.

29:00.666 --> 29:01.875
<i>Hello, Kai-kai.</i>

29:02.666 --> 29:03.708
Hello, Mom.

29:04.375 --> 29:05.791
Why aren't you sleeping?

29:05.875 --> 29:07.208
<i>Where are you?</i>

29:07.291 --> 29:09.333
<i>Why aren't you home at this hour?</i>

29:11.333 --> 29:12.916
<i>You're still working?</i>

29:14.291 --> 29:16.291
I'm on the night shift lately.

29:16.791 --> 29:18.166
It pays more.

29:19.250 --> 29:20.625
<i>Don't get too tired.</i>

29:20.708 --> 29:22.750
<i>Take good care of yourself.</i>

29:22.833 --> 29:24.875
Okay, you too.

29:26.041 --> 29:27.541
<i>Once I get my salary in advance,</i>

29:27.625 --> 29:29.500
<i>I'll wire the money
first thing in the morning.</i>

29:30.041 --> 29:31.416
Okay.

29:33.083 --> 29:34.458
<i>Kai-kai.</i>

29:37.375 --> 29:38.750
<i>Kai-kai.</i>

29:39.333 --> 29:41.125
<i>-I--</i>
-Mom.

29:41.208 --> 29:43.875
My customer wants to pay now. Bye.

29:50.166 --> 29:51.958
Excuse me, I would like to pay.

29:56.958 --> 29:58.500
I'm sorry for making you wait.

30:00.958 --> 30:02.375
<i>I always thought</i>

30:02.458 --> 30:04.166
<i>that the world abandoned me.</i>

30:05.875 --> 30:08.250
<i>Just when I started to feel numb</i>

30:08.333 --> 30:10.625
<i>to all this misfortune,</i>

30:11.666 --> 30:15.000
<i>a strange girl suddenly barged
into my life.</i>

30:30.375 --> 30:32.416
Hey, what are you doing?

30:32.500 --> 30:33.666
I'm sorry.

30:33.750 --> 30:35.250
You darned pervert.

30:56.083 --> 30:57.416
What happened?

30:57.500 --> 30:58.791
You got into a fight?

31:00.375 --> 31:01.500
I bumped into a wall.

31:01.583 --> 31:03.291
Let me see. It's so cool.

31:03.791 --> 31:05.708
Hey, Su Kuo-pei, our teacher is here.

31:06.875 --> 31:07.833
Good morning, everyone.

31:07.916 --> 31:09.875
-Good morning, ma'am.
-Good morning, ma'am.

31:09.958 --> 31:13.083
Starting today,
we have a transfer student.

31:13.791 --> 31:16.166
Let's welcome the new student,
Sung Yuan-yuan.

31:21.625 --> 31:23.250
ENGLISH GUIDEBOOK

31:28.458 --> 31:29.583
Darn it.

31:30.083 --> 31:32.333
Yuan-yuan, you may sit at the back…

31:34.500 --> 31:35.916
Ma'am.

31:37.625 --> 31:38.708
I want to sit here.

31:39.791 --> 31:41.833
No, ma'am.
I can't listen in class this way.

31:41.916 --> 31:43.791
You just keep chatting with Chang Che-kai.

31:43.875 --> 31:45.458
I've wanted to switch your seat long ago.

31:45.541 --> 31:46.708
Go quickly.

31:54.416 --> 31:55.875
Hey, new neighbor.

32:01.583 --> 32:03.833
You're smiling?
You're even smiling, you bastard!

32:03.916 --> 32:06.125
Why don't you die? Go to hell!

32:06.208 --> 32:07.833
-Why don't you die? Go on!
-What?

32:07.916 --> 32:08.833
-Go to hell!
-Sung Yuan-yuan!

32:08.916 --> 32:10.375
-Don't fight!
-What good did you do?

32:10.458 --> 32:11.541
-You're shameless!
-Are you okay?

32:11.625 --> 32:12.500
-Che-kai.
-Let me go!

32:12.583 --> 32:15.458
Ma'am, Chang Che-kai
harassed me on the bus today.

32:15.541 --> 32:16.708
He used his head to touch my chest.

32:16.791 --> 32:20.000
That was why I taught this pervert,
trash, and bastard a lesson.

32:20.083 --> 32:22.208
It was a misunderstanding.
I didn't mean to do that.

32:22.291 --> 32:23.916
Ma'am, I fell asleep and didn't even know.

32:24.000 --> 32:25.500
Cut the crap.

32:25.583 --> 32:27.833
You apologized immediately.
That means you know what you were doing.

32:28.416 --> 32:29.875
-I just--
-That's enough.

32:29.958 --> 32:31.750
I believe that Che-kai
didn't do it on purpose.

32:32.333 --> 32:33.791
I understand why Yuan-yuan's upset.

32:33.875 --> 32:35.833
But using violence is still wrong.

32:35.916 --> 32:37.250
This is your first offense,

32:37.333 --> 32:39.750
so your punishment is to clean up
after school today.

32:39.833 --> 32:41.583
-Okay.
-All right. Go back to class.

32:41.666 --> 32:44.250
Che-kai, I want to talk to you.

32:48.916 --> 32:52.083
Che-kai, your grades
have dropped a lot this year.

32:54.875 --> 32:56.708
I'm not blaming you.

32:56.791 --> 32:59.958
I know that your family
is going through a lot too.

33:00.041 --> 33:03.208
But the school doesn't encourage students
to have part-time jobs.

33:03.291 --> 33:05.833
Students must prioritize their studies.

33:06.583 --> 33:07.708
My dad is more important.

33:11.958 --> 33:13.708
Is your mom still working away from home?

33:14.875 --> 33:16.250
Yes.

33:16.333 --> 33:17.625
How about this?

33:17.708 --> 33:19.333
I'll ask the Social Affairs Bureau's help

33:19.416 --> 33:21.000
-to see if your family--
-No need, ma'am.

33:21.666 --> 33:22.875
I already checked.

33:23.708 --> 33:25.583
My grandpa left us our house.

33:25.666 --> 33:26.833
That alone

33:26.916 --> 33:28.250
doesn't fit the requirements.

33:29.000 --> 33:31.041
More people must need help more than I do.

33:33.541 --> 33:34.750
All right then.

33:40.083 --> 33:41.125
Chang Che-kai.

33:42.875 --> 33:44.500
What happened this morning
was a misunderstanding.

33:44.583 --> 33:45.791
Forget it if you don't believe it.

33:50.791 --> 33:52.458
Are you crazy?
Don't think I won't hit you.

33:52.541 --> 33:54.000
Go ahead. Try it.

33:54.083 --> 33:56.958
-Hit me!
-Hey, no fighting! Hey!

33:57.041 --> 33:57.875
REWARD AND PUNISHMENT NOTICE

33:57.958 --> 33:59.791
-It's Sung Yuan-yuan.
-She hit someone.

33:59.875 --> 34:01.500
-She hit someone,
-It's assault.

34:01.583 --> 34:02.708
and she only got a demerit.

34:02.791 --> 34:05.625
-Didn't she just transfer here?
-She got lucky.

34:05.708 --> 34:07.750
Even a warning as punishment is too light.

34:07.833 --> 34:09.500
-I think…
-She should get expelled.

34:09.583 --> 34:11.291
Hey, what's your deal with the new girl?

34:11.375 --> 34:12.750
Why does she keep hitting you?

34:12.833 --> 34:14.333
Who knows?

34:14.416 --> 34:15.750
Does she like you?

34:16.708 --> 34:18.208
-Seriously?
-No way.

34:19.125 --> 34:21.666
As your classmate for three years,
you don't look like you deserve a beating.

34:21.750 --> 34:23.458
You're the one who deserves a beating.

34:23.541 --> 34:24.625
BASTARD, NASTY,
DISGUSTING, PERVERT

34:24.708 --> 34:25.875
To be honest,

34:25.958 --> 34:27.875
should we use violence to curb violence?

34:27.958 --> 34:29.708
If she beats you up again next time,

34:29.791 --> 34:31.083
fight back.

34:31.166 --> 34:32.375
How is that possible?

34:32.458 --> 34:34.000
She's a girl.

34:37.541 --> 34:39.166
At least, she looks like one.

34:41.208 --> 34:43.750
So you don't hit girls?

34:46.250 --> 34:47.375
Am I hearing things?

34:51.041 --> 34:52.458
No, it was him.

34:52.541 --> 34:54.500
Try hitting me! Hit me if you dare!

34:54.583 --> 34:56.750
-How dare you?
-Hey!

34:56.833 --> 34:58.000
Hit me!

34:59.750 --> 35:01.208
-Hit me! Come on!
-Stop fighting!

35:01.291 --> 35:02.458
Stop fighting!

35:02.541 --> 35:03.958
Hit me if you dare!

35:04.041 --> 35:06.291
SUNG YUAN-YUAN IS GIVEN A WARNING
FOR BEATING UP A STUDENT

35:08.333 --> 35:11.625
-A fairy came to answer questions.
-Hey, Sung Yuan-yuan!

35:12.250 --> 35:13.958
What fairy?

35:28.250 --> 35:29.708
Come here!

35:31.041 --> 35:32.250
You're still running?

35:32.333 --> 35:33.291
You bastard!

35:33.375 --> 35:34.500
BULLYING, ATTACKING A STUDENT

35:39.541 --> 35:41.500
-Chang Che-kai has athlete's foot!
-You're ugly.

35:41.583 --> 35:43.708
-It stinks!
-Hey!

35:47.958 --> 35:49.041
SUNG YUAN-YUAN TEASED A STUDENT

35:49.125 --> 35:49.958
It stinks!

35:52.083 --> 35:52.958
Sung Yuan-yuan!

35:55.541 --> 35:57.666
ENGLISH GUIDEBOOK

36:04.625 --> 36:05.791
Welcome.

36:41.208 --> 36:42.250
Hello, Dad.

36:42.333 --> 36:45.000
<i>Che-kai, can you bring me some…</i>

36:45.083 --> 36:49.291
Okay. I'll take it to the hospital
after class tomorrow.

36:49.875 --> 36:52.000
-Do you need anything else?
<i>-No, nothing else.</i>

36:52.083 --> 36:53.000
<i>Are you still at work?</i>

36:53.083 --> 36:54.500
-Okay.
<i>-Get some rest.</i>

36:55.083 --> 36:56.666
You're the one who should get some rest.

36:57.291 --> 36:59.291
<i>-Good night.</i>
-Good night, bye.

37:00.333 --> 37:02.125
EXTRA SPICY CURRY RICE

37:05.541 --> 37:06.750
Do you want it heated?

37:25.750 --> 37:27.833
What did I ever do to you?

37:34.083 --> 37:35.833
Aren't you afraid of being expelled?

37:38.541 --> 37:39.791
Three warnings equal one minor demerit.

37:39.875 --> 37:41.083
Three minor demerits equal
one major demerit.

37:41.166 --> 37:42.875
I'll get expelled
only after getting three major demerits.

37:43.458 --> 37:44.875
That means

37:44.958 --> 37:47.000
I can still beat you up ten more times.

37:47.083 --> 37:48.875
I'll make the most of them.

37:49.791 --> 37:51.250
You're so good at math.

37:56.000 --> 37:58.208
Hitting people is exhausting.
Nourish yourself.

38:05.250 --> 38:06.541
Your dad is in the hospital?

38:08.833 --> 38:09.666
Yes.

38:11.375 --> 38:12.833
What is his sickness?

38:14.166 --> 38:15.375
It has nothing to do with you.

38:17.166 --> 38:18.583
Tell me

38:18.666 --> 38:20.583
and I'll consider not hitting you anymore.

38:21.541 --> 38:22.708
Really?

38:22.791 --> 38:23.833
Why not?

38:34.250 --> 38:35.458
Leukemia.

38:39.541 --> 38:41.375
So you're working part-time

38:41.458 --> 38:43.583
for your dad's hospital bills?

38:44.500 --> 38:45.833
And other things.

38:47.416 --> 38:48.916
What other things?

38:51.625 --> 38:53.458
Making up for mistakes.

38:57.916 --> 38:58.958
Okay.

38:59.791 --> 39:01.583
Thank you for the beverage.

39:01.666 --> 39:02.916
I'll keep my word.

39:17.625 --> 39:20.083
Have you thought about
how you're going to be bullied today?

39:20.166 --> 39:21.916
Be quiet.

39:22.000 --> 39:23.625
I prepared a lot of things for you.

39:23.708 --> 39:26.625
Band-Aids, cotton swabs,

39:26.708 --> 39:28.250
and iodine.

39:31.208 --> 39:32.250
Take them.

39:35.750 --> 39:36.750
They're for you.

39:36.833 --> 39:38.375
Didn't you work
the night shift last night?

39:38.458 --> 39:40.125
I bet you didn't eat anything.

39:49.083 --> 39:50.875
What are you looking at?
Do you want a beating?

39:51.458 --> 39:52.500
No.

40:06.583 --> 40:08.416
PING HE MEMORIAL HOSPITAL

40:12.041 --> 40:13.458
328 pressed the emergency button.

40:17.750 --> 40:19.708
The patient…

40:21.541 --> 40:22.791
-Dad.
-Family, please wait outside.

40:22.875 --> 40:24.708
-Dad.
-The doctor is handling it.

40:25.458 --> 40:26.583
Thank you.

40:56.583 --> 40:58.083
<i>Hello, Kai-kai.</i>

41:10.000 --> 41:11.000
<i>Kai-kai.</i>

41:11.541 --> 41:12.541
<i>Hello?</i>

41:13.250 --> 41:14.458
<i>Kai-kai?</i>

41:42.208 --> 41:43.791
You're being a thief?

41:43.875 --> 41:45.208
You're pretty gutsy.

47:11.500 --> 47:15.666
