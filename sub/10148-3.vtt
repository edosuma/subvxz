01:27.672 --> 01:29.840
Is tell all their buds
the Martians are coming.

01:30.299 --> 01:31.467
Second thing.

01:31.550 --> 01:33.150
First they gotta
get their pants cleaned.

01:44.063 --> 01:45.606
<i>Having fun with the new toy?</i>

01:45.898 --> 01:47.733
You built us a winner, doc.

01:47.942 --> 01:49.944
Wish I had one of these in the last war.

01:50.278 --> 01:51.988
<i>I'm sure
there'll be another, soon enough.</i>

01:52.071 --> 01:53.489
<i>Now, how about some numbers?</i>

01:54.824 --> 01:56.826
R and B pressure, 20, 40 PSI.

01:56.909 --> 01:58.828
Excel pressure, 1104.

01:58.911 --> 02:00.371
Fuel temp, 280. Air speed...

02:00.454 --> 02:01.831
<i>Did you say 280?</i>

02:02.665 --> 02:04.375
Roger. 2-8-0.

02:05.668 --> 02:07.044
Is that a problem?

02:07.128 --> 02:09.171
<i>Get out.
Get out, right now.</i>

02:11.048 --> 02:13.509
<i>Yes. My team Will be
along for it in five minutes.</i>

02:14.552 --> 02:15.928
<i>Land right now
and get as far away</i>

02:16.012 --> 02:17.638
<i>from the vehicle as fast as you can.</i>

02:19.015 --> 02:21.726
I'm telling you, Scab. It was a UFO.

02:22.059 --> 02:23.144
Who cares?

02:24.312 --> 02:26.314
We got something more important to do.

02:26.605 --> 02:29.191
Oh, yeah.
We do, don't we?

02:29.859 --> 02:31.110
You know why the Jokerz come

02:31.193 --> 02:33.362
all the way out here
to do our initiations?

02:34.447 --> 02:36.907
So no one can hear you scream.

02:45.958 --> 02:47.158
What are you gonna do to me...

02:47.543 --> 02:48.669
exacfly?

02:49.253 --> 02:50.755
You scared, Lee?

02:50.838 --> 02:51.922
Nope.

02:52.340 --> 02:53.507
Just curious.

02:53.841 --> 02:55.551
Then step right this way.

02:55.634 --> 02:56.927
Wait.

03:05.603 --> 03:07.396
Oh! It's the UFO.

03:07.772 --> 03:10.191
Probably Fat T's crew spying on us.

03:10.399 --> 03:13.527
All the other gangs want to know
how we do our initiations.

03:36.258 --> 03:37.301
It's okay.

03:38.844 --> 03:41.597
Scab, this is a UFO. Isn't it?

03:41.680 --> 03:42.556
Wake up, Coe.

03:42.640 --> 03:44.308
All the writing's in English.

03:44.392 --> 03:45.559
You can read?

03:47.645 --> 03:50.189
Uh, if this isn't a UFO,
then what is it?

03:50.272 --> 03:51.357
Don't know.

03:59.198 --> 04:01.826
- Now I know what this thing is.
- What?

04:02.201 --> 04:03.202
Ours.

04:26.767 --> 04:28.477
You guys enjoying the ride?

04:29.562 --> 04:33.149
You think maybe you could
slow it down a little?

04:38.404 --> 04:40.865
<i>I'm addressing
Whoever stole the experimental vehicle.</i>

04:41.198 --> 04:42.700
That'd be me.

04:42.783 --> 04:44.326
<i>Who are you?</i>

04:44.410 --> 04:45.786
Who are you?

04:45.870 --> 04:47.455
You sound hot. Are you hot?

04:48.330 --> 04:49.540
Listen to me.

04:49.623 --> 04:51.625
That vehicle is government property.

04:51.709 --> 04:53.544
You have to return it. Now.

04:54.170 --> 04:55.463
Typical babe.

04:55.671 --> 04:58.424
Ain't even met you
and you're already giving me orders.

04:58.966 --> 05:01.051
<i>There's another reason
you need to return it.</i>

05:01.385 --> 05:02.428
Blah, blah, blah.

05:18.027 --> 05:19.028
What's that?

05:23.491 --> 05:25.075
Party time.

05:25.576 --> 05:26.994
Yeah! All right!

05:30.998 --> 05:32.583
Nice ride, Scab.

05:32.666 --> 05:33.667
Where'd you get it?

05:34.001 --> 05:37.087
My grades were good
so my folks bought me a car.

05:38.506 --> 05:39.506
[Uaughs]

05:40.216 --> 05:41.759
Let's take it out for a spin.

05:41.842 --> 05:44.345
You got it. Who's hungry?

05:47.890 --> 05:50.130
<i>Welcome to Bee Fee Burger.
May I take your order, please?</i>

05:52.478 --> 05:56.774
Two dozen burgers, fries,
couple gallons of shakes.

05:56.857 --> 05:59.735
- And a big Beefer.
- To go.

06:00.528 --> 06:01.528
Uh...

06:03.280 --> 06:04.406
Sixty units, please.

06:05.032 --> 06:06.867
But Bee Fee says it's on the house.

06:07.701 --> 06:09.161
Sir, I... I really can't...

06:19.129 --> 06:20.422
Bee Fee says...

07:16.020 --> 07:17.020
Uh-oh.

07:20.190 --> 07:22.276
Hey, Bats. Want to race?

07:29.950 --> 07:32.036
I think
it's some kind of military vehicle.

07:32.119 --> 07:33.329
<i>Real fast and maneuverable.</i>

07:34.371 --> 07:35.497
So stop them.

07:36.290 --> 07:37.666
Easy for you to say.

08:02.816 --> 08:03.816
Gotcha.

08:23.420 --> 08:26.715
What do you say we finish him off
up close and personal?

08:26.799 --> 08:27.799
Yeah!

08:30.427 --> 08:32.554
All of you, to finish one guy?

08:56.161 --> 08:58.288
What happened to up close and personal?

08:58.664 --> 08:59.832
Shut up.

09:09.883 --> 09:10.883
Ahh!

09:38.120 --> 09:39.663
Buh-bye, Bats.

10:03.020 --> 10:04.020
You all right?

10:05.022 --> 10:06.982
Nothing a few transplants
won't cure, but...

10:07.191 --> 10:08.442
Good enough.

10:08.525 --> 10:09.525
Wait a minute.

10:09.651 --> 10:11.069
Who are you? What's going on?

10:11.195 --> 10:12.237
That's classified.

10:12.529 --> 10:13.739
Government stuff, huh?

10:14.239 --> 10:15.239
That's what I figured.

10:15.407 --> 10:16.867
You don't know anything.

10:17.618 --> 10:19.203
I know who jacked your ride.

10:21.121 --> 10:22.121
Who?

10:23.749 --> 10:24.749
Give me a lift.

10:24.917 --> 10:26.168
I want them as bad as you do.

10:26.251 --> 10:27.669
No deals.

10:28.962 --> 10:29.963
They're Jokerz.

10:31.298 --> 10:32.298
Madmen.

10:32.674 --> 10:34.009
No. Kids.

10:34.468 --> 10:36.068
You're gonna have to think like they do.

10:36.094 --> 10:37.094
Can you?

10:53.153 --> 10:54.153
That other ship...

10:54.488 --> 10:56.990
It was nowhere near
as fast as this one, or as big.

10:57.449 --> 10:58.450
Sure wasn't.

10:58.826 --> 11:00.410
So how come we didn't trash 'em?

11:00.911 --> 11:04.164
Uh, 'cause we got
more important things to do.

11:04.748 --> 11:05.748
We do?

11:06.166 --> 11:08.085
The T's, kid. The T's.

11:08.585 --> 11:10.003
They gotta be educated.

11:15.509 --> 11:16.802
Nice plane.

11:17.344 --> 11:19.263
Not quite as nice
as the Jokerz's, though.

11:19.638 --> 11:21.473
Thanks. I built it.

11:21.765 --> 11:23.642
Then you should've kept
a better eye on it.

11:24.351 --> 11:27.396
- I ordered the pilots to abort.
- Why?

11:27.771 --> 11:28.771
Not your problem.

11:29.439 --> 11:31.149
You want me to help you or not?

11:32.985 --> 11:34.903
The fuel cell has a design flaw.

11:35.445 --> 11:36.530
Like...

11:37.239 --> 11:39.241
A breach in the vehicle's reactor.

11:40.158 --> 11:41.994
Reactor? As in nuclear?

11:42.202 --> 11:44.806
But that's been illegal for years.
It could take out half the city.

11:44.830 --> 11:46.582
Don't you think I know that?

11:46.790 --> 11:48.977
But how was I supposed to make
something state-of-the-art

11:49.001 --> 11:51.587
on the pitiful budget
the government gave me, how?

11:52.713 --> 11:54.882
Look, we need
to find those dregs.

11:54.965 --> 11:56.466
And you said you could help.

11:59.303 --> 12:01.138
I'd start down there.

12:02.014 --> 12:03.014
Oh, no.

12:16.570 --> 12:18.447
They're T's. Another gang.

12:18.739 --> 12:20.365
Been fighting with the Jokerz for years.

12:20.949 --> 12:22.868
That doesn't mean they deserved this.

12:24.077 --> 12:25.370
It's all because of me.

12:25.704 --> 12:27.331
And it's only gonna get worse.

12:33.211 --> 12:34.838
Smoked 'em! Whoo-hoo!

12:35.213 --> 12:36.213
Sure did.

12:36.924 --> 12:39.968
But there's a lot of fat butts
still to kick, J-man.

12:40.052 --> 12:41.970
Fat T's headquarters.

12:42.054 --> 12:45.390
He can't stop us anymore,
not with this thing.

12:47.434 --> 12:49.686
All they had were
some chains and Tasers.

12:49.770 --> 12:52.481
Well, they should've been prepared.

12:52.564 --> 12:54.608
Guess they were never in the Boy Scouts.

12:59.029 --> 13:00.155
Them again.

13:27.015 --> 13:28.350
What are you doing?

13:28.600 --> 13:29.600
Stopping them.

13:30.018 --> 13:32.145
Better turn, Scab. You better turn.

13:32.604 --> 13:34.773
She wants to play chicken.

13:34.856 --> 13:36.692
That's a game I always win.

13:43.115 --> 13:44.950
If we hit them,
the reactor will blow up.

13:45.534 --> 13:47.202
No, it's shielded from impact.

13:47.369 --> 13:50.580
But right after the crash, you're gonna
have to use this key to deactivate it.

13:50.789 --> 13:53.291
Uh, hello? I don't think
I'm gonna be in any condition to...

13:53.375 --> 13:54.376
Yes, you will.

13:59.673 --> 14:01.508
Scab, I don't think they're gonna turn.

14:02.050 --> 14:03.050
Shut up.

14:03.385 --> 14:04.511
Scab!

14:41.798 --> 14:43.175
Did you kill the reactor?

14:43.467 --> 14:45.010
No. They got away.

14:45.552 --> 14:46.595
You built some ship, lady.

14:47.179 --> 14:48.722
You have to stop them.

14:49.681 --> 14:50.681
You'll be okay?

14:50.724 --> 14:52.517
In another few minutes, it won't matter.

14:52.642 --> 14:53.643
Now, go!

15:12.662 --> 15:13.663
{933931

15:17.375 --> 15:18.418
All right.

15:20.295 --> 15:21.295
Whoa!

15:28.428 --> 15:29.930
Where are they going?

15:30.388 --> 15:32.432
To Grandma's, for milk and cookies.

15:33.225 --> 15:34.893
Don't want to rat out the Jokerz, huh?

15:35.268 --> 15:36.311
They're my bros.

15:36.561 --> 15:37.561
Yeah?

15:37.604 --> 15:38.924
Well, your bros just ditched you.

15:41.691 --> 15:43.485
Looks like you're an only child now.

15:44.319 --> 15:45.362
They're going to bust up

15:45.445 --> 15:47.864
the T's headquarters
at the old subway station.

15:48.156 --> 15:49.199
I don't know when, though.

15:49.616 --> 15:51.159
Let's hope it's not too late.

16:13.807 --> 16:15.642
Out! Everyone.

16:21.565 --> 16:23.108
Out!

16:25.777 --> 16:26.778
Freak.

16:27.070 --> 16:29.072
Nobody gives orders to Fat T.

16:29.239 --> 16:30.239
Nobody!

16:57.559 --> 16:59.311
Now, all of you get out of here.

17:00.395 --> 17:01.521
Please.

17:12.741 --> 17:13.867
So where are they all?

17:45.148 --> 17:46.316
What's that?

18:42.580 --> 18:44.708
Gonna finish this now, Bats.

18:45.041 --> 18:46.126
You'll go, too.

18:46.960 --> 18:48.295
The reactor's overloading.

18:48.628 --> 18:50.088
Nice try.

18:50.880 --> 18:52.090
Look at it.

18:52.882 --> 18:54.301
<i>That key'“ stop “ft.</i>

18:55.051 --> 18:56.344
Can't do it.

18:56.594 --> 18:57.846
Are you out of your mind?

18:58.680 --> 19:00.056
I'm not giving this up.

19:00.390 --> 19:03.310
For once in my life,
I've got some real power.

19:03.560 --> 19:05.020
You never had any with the Jokerz?

19:05.437 --> 19:06.813
Don't make me laugh.

19:06.980 --> 19:08.273
They were just a crutch.

19:08.815 --> 19:10.025
So is this ship.

19:10.191 --> 19:12.610
Yeah, but it's a crutch with muscle.

19:12.819 --> 19:14.654
I'm telling you it won't last.

19:15.196 --> 19:17.115
Maybe, maybe not.

19:17.866 --> 19:19.701
But you won't be around to care.

20:20.887 --> 20:24.015
No!
