00:01.835 --> 00:03.461
Previously on Nurse Jackie...

00:03.545 --> 00:05.797
You know this is pretend, right?

00:05.881 --> 00:07.799
How long do I get to keep it on?

00:07.883 --> 00:09.550
I shouldn't talk about my kids.

00:09.635 --> 00:11.844
How about Kevin? What's he up to?

00:11.929 --> 00:15.181
You guys hanging out,
it's very cute, but it's gotta stop.

00:15.724 --> 00:19.435
I'm on the list of the top 25 docs
in all Manhattan.

00:19.520 --> 00:22.397
We want to launch a citywide campaign

00:22.481 --> 00:25.566
featuring you as the face of All Saints.

00:27.986 --> 00:30.488
When I get nervous
I act out with inappropriate sexual touches.

00:30.572 --> 00:31.906
It's like Tourette's.

00:31.990 --> 00:34.742
She's leaving Gaza
to take a desk in Washington.

00:34.827 --> 00:38.121
Really? You know Sarah Khouri?
God, I could not love her more.

00:38.205 --> 00:40.915
-You said you'd call.
-I lied.

00:46.255 --> 00:47.588
I think I'm pregnant.

00:48.465 --> 00:49.590
Wow.

00:51.093 --> 00:52.343
Bleeding!

00:55.931 --> 00:57.807
-What the hell?
-What?

00:57.891 --> 01:00.143
You told me to stop seeing him.
I never said I would.

01:00.227 --> 01:02.145
You lie to me again, I tell him everything.

01:02.229 --> 01:04.397
I see. So you just got the whole thing
figured out then?

01:04.481 --> 01:06.274
As a matter of fact, I do.

02:19.431 --> 02:21.641
Oh, God, you know what?
This stuff smells toxic.

02:21.725 --> 02:24.101
-I'm sorry, it just... It does.
-No, I got it.

02:24.186 --> 02:27.480
Never again.
Let's just clean up so you can get to work.

02:28.524 --> 02:31.108
-Stop it. Mommy!
-I'm gonna get you. I'm gonna get you!

02:31.193 --> 02:33.277
All right, all right, honey, come on.
Stop, go inside.

02:33.362 --> 02:37.240
Go in the other room, play with your sister.
Give me that. You, behave. Get a beer.

02:39.993 --> 02:42.870
-Need a hand with anything?
-No, no, we got it. Thanks.

02:48.710 --> 02:52.713
That mac and cheese was delicious.
Could have eaten four bowls.

02:58.011 --> 02:59.762
The best lunch I've had in weeks.

03:05.811 --> 03:08.437
Really, honey?
You couldn't be just a little bit nicer?

03:08.522 --> 03:10.523
What are you talking about? I was nice.

03:11.358 --> 03:12.483
I'm just saying.

03:13.402 --> 03:17.113
Okay, have you been to

03:17.573 --> 03:20.157
-Egypt?
-Four times.

03:20.242 --> 03:21.409
Really?

03:22.369 --> 03:24.495
Catch me, catch me!

03:24.580 --> 03:25.997
Stop it. I'm talking.

03:26.081 --> 03:30.167
-You went four times?
-She's been everywhere at least four times.

03:30.252 --> 03:33.337
Look, if you want to drop out
of high school and just travel the world,

03:33.422 --> 03:35.715
you'll end up way smarter than
all those other stupid kids.

03:35.799 --> 03:38.175
I'm not in high school. I'm in fifth grade.

03:38.260 --> 03:40.553
-Really?
-Come on.

03:42.222 --> 03:43.973
Come on!

03:46.768 --> 03:48.269
Don't run so fast.

03:51.398 --> 03:53.065
-Daddy!
-Mom!

03:53.150 --> 03:55.276
-Mommy!
-Daddy!

03:55.777 --> 03:57.737
Let's have a look. Let's have a look.

03:59.156 --> 04:00.531
I see...

04:00.616 --> 04:02.867
Sweetie, okay.

04:02.951 --> 04:05.244
Let me see. Goodness gracious.

04:05.329 --> 04:08.080
Put this right here.
Let's go into the kitchen.

04:08.165 --> 04:11.667
No, I'll get the car.
We're going to urgent care, not the kitchen.

04:11.752 --> 04:15.046
The quicker we deal with it,
the smaller the scar. It's all right, sweetie.

04:15.130 --> 04:17.381
Upstairs under the bathroom sink
is my stuff.

04:17.466 --> 04:19.050
-Got it.
-Okay, you're all right, sweetie.

04:19.134 --> 04:20.509
I got you. I got you.

04:22.596 --> 04:24.055
Is she gonna have a scar?

04:25.307 --> 04:27.808
No way. Come on. Let's go watch.

04:30.103 --> 04:32.146
Okay, so what do you think?

04:33.106 --> 04:34.982
Three stitches should do the trick.

04:36.026 --> 04:38.277
Make sure the vermilion border heals nicely.

04:38.987 --> 04:41.197
Okay, Lidocaine, please.

04:41.990 --> 04:44.659
Pen, please. Right.

04:45.577 --> 04:46.619
Come here, you.

04:46.703 --> 04:48.955
Sweetie, I'm gonna put some
numbing stuff on, okay?

04:49.665 --> 04:54.168
-"Real blood." Marvelous.
-It's all right.

04:54.252 --> 04:57.922
You show that to all your friends, because
you're not scared at all, are you, darling?

04:58.006 --> 05:00.591
-No.
-And it's been a bloody afternoon,

05:00.676 --> 05:01.926
here in Queens.

05:02.010 --> 05:04.762
But residents seem optimistic

05:04.846 --> 05:07.515
that everything
will soon return to utter chaos.

05:11.103 --> 05:14.313
Why don't you lean against Daddy?
He'll help you hold still, okay, sweetie?

05:14.523 --> 05:17.692
So, next weekend
we'll take Fiona's tonsils out on the porch?

05:18.527 --> 05:19.819
You're welcome.

05:21.279 --> 05:22.655
Dinner later?

05:22.739 --> 05:26.951
There's at least two places I want to go,
so we might have to eat at both of them.

05:27.035 --> 05:28.786
And a third for pudding.

05:36.044 --> 05:37.086
Pudding, huh?

05:40.090 --> 05:43.551
I can't listen to every single voicemail
that you leave me.

05:44.845 --> 05:47.513
Sweetie, what am I supposed to do?

06:00.402 --> 06:03.946
-Are you praying?
-What? No. Why?

06:04.698 --> 06:08.159
Because your lips are moving
and you're wearing a cross.

06:09.161 --> 06:10.327
Yeah.

06:12.164 --> 06:14.290
I made a deal with God
that if I wasn't pregnant,

06:14.374 --> 06:18.210
I would make some serious changes
in my life and my work.

06:18.879 --> 06:22.798
And my appearance.
And I move my lips when I read.

06:26.178 --> 06:27.303
What up?

06:28.263 --> 06:29.472
Is your face different?

06:30.098 --> 06:31.766
I trimmed my goatee.

06:33.393 --> 06:34.560
Looks good.

06:42.486 --> 06:45.529
That was... That was something, right?

06:45.614 --> 06:46.697
That was some heat.

06:46.782 --> 06:49.992
-And she's definitely not pregnant.
-You've got a shot, man.

06:51.745 --> 06:55.956
Exam one. Move her gently and efficiently
or I will kill you.

06:56.625 --> 06:59.418
Both of you, now. Libby Sussman.

07:02.798 --> 07:05.591
Hello? Hello?

07:05.675 --> 07:08.135
Oh, my God, that's Libby.

07:09.721 --> 07:10.971
Sussman!

07:12.224 --> 07:16.727
Hello? The Sussman Foundation.
The Sussman Cardiovascular Institute.

07:16.812 --> 07:20.314
The Sussman Surgical Theater. Do you
read any of the plaques around here?

07:21.483 --> 07:23.651
You said Sussman like 12 times.

07:24.653 --> 07:28.072
Do you remember feeling dizzy
or nauseated before you collapsed?

07:28.156 --> 07:31.117
I remember being at the Waldorf,

07:31.201 --> 07:36.914
about to bid 25 grand on dinner at Per Se,
and now I'm here.

07:36.998 --> 07:39.583
Do you remember whether or not
the Sussman Foundation has decided

07:39.668 --> 07:42.711
to increase its endowment
to include the improvements in the ER?

07:42.796 --> 07:45.923
Gloria, Gloria, the funding is coming.

07:46.007 --> 07:49.218
You're much more attractive
when you're not asking for things.

07:49.845 --> 07:53.347
Do you mind warming your hands
before you handle me?

07:55.851 --> 07:58.269
You know, Dr. O'Hara is from Britain.

07:58.353 --> 08:00.187
Yes, I'm from the whole of Britain.

08:02.440 --> 08:04.191
Are you still feeling light-headed,
Mrs. Sussman?

08:04.276 --> 08:08.487
Yes, I am a little.
I think it's from all the talking and touching.

08:08.572 --> 08:12.449
Well, good news
is all signs point to Vasovagal syncope.

08:13.201 --> 08:17.079
Simple fainting spell, but we'll run
a few tests just to be on the safe side.

08:17.164 --> 08:19.582
EKG and a chest X-ray for starters.

08:19.666 --> 08:23.627
Check it out! I heard there was
another celebrity in the ER.

08:23.712 --> 08:28.883
Look at him. He's ridiculous.

08:30.468 --> 08:32.469
-Head injury?
-Nope.

08:33.263 --> 08:36.557
You look like
one of my grandson's action figures.

08:39.352 --> 08:41.270
I've always had good posture.

08:42.355 --> 08:44.023
Really, I'm a real doctor.

08:45.442 --> 08:48.903
No, no, no. Get me somebody else, please.

08:50.614 --> 08:52.448
Yes, Mrs. Sussman, that'll be me.

08:53.408 --> 08:54.491
Really?

09:04.586 --> 09:06.462
Hi. Can you sign off on a patient for me?

09:06.546 --> 09:08.464
I don't know, can I?
Am I real enough for you?

09:08.548 --> 09:10.883
Well, okay, I mean,

09:11.509 --> 09:15.429
maybe you're not the realest person
I've ever met in my entire life.

09:15.513 --> 09:20.226
But I think that compared to most people
on posters, you...

09:22.103 --> 09:23.854
Didn't want an honest answer.

09:26.900 --> 09:28.025
Are you Zoey?

09:30.820 --> 09:33.072
You're Sarah Khouri.

09:33.156 --> 09:36.867
-Why do you know my name?
-Ellie is my... Dr. O'Hara.

09:36.952 --> 09:39.286
You know Dr. O'Hara? Oh, my God.

09:39.871 --> 09:41.956
Dr. O'Hara talks about me outside of work?

09:42.791 --> 09:43.999
She does.

09:44.084 --> 09:46.877
Are you two, like, best friends?

09:46.962 --> 09:49.255
That's what we told my Uncle Henry.

09:52.842 --> 09:53.884
God.

09:54.678 --> 09:58.722
It's like I can't see gayness or something.
It's so annoying.

09:58.807 --> 10:01.976
Not that you're gay. Not that you're not.

10:05.522 --> 10:11.610
I got bit by a brown
recluse spider in Arizona,

10:11.695 --> 10:13.153
two weeks ago.

10:13.238 --> 10:15.739
-Yeah, has anybody seen that?
-I went to the ER in Phoenix,

10:15.824 --> 10:20.160
but the nurses were just too tan
and friendly.

10:21.079 --> 10:25.249
So you want me to treat you
because I'm pale?

10:25.333 --> 10:27.167
I don't want you to admit me

10:27.252 --> 10:30.212
because I can't possibly
sit around here all day.

10:30.297 --> 10:32.131
And Ellie tells me
that you're the kind of girl

10:32.215 --> 10:34.425
who gets in there and gets the job done.

10:34.509 --> 10:38.846
This would be off the record, right?

10:38.930 --> 10:40.055
Exactly.

10:44.728 --> 10:45.853
Fine.

10:46.896 --> 10:49.648
Meet me at the end of my shift
in the bathroom.

10:50.859 --> 10:54.611
I'll get what you need.
But we gotta be cool.

10:57.615 --> 11:01.076
By funding a dedicated
chest-imaging system in the ER,

11:01.161 --> 11:05.372
we could create cost-effective ways
to deal with our increased patient load.

11:05.457 --> 11:09.626
I could take a million from
the children's wing and help out the ER,

11:09.711 --> 11:13.213
but why don't we just see
how the rest of the night goes, shall we?

11:14.049 --> 11:17.551
We could discuss these plans
over sandwiches. I'll run to the deli.

11:21.264 --> 11:23.766
The budget cuts are really getting to her.

11:23.850 --> 11:26.477
Do you really have to take all that?

11:26.561 --> 11:28.771
I never take more than I can use.

11:33.401 --> 11:36.445
Before you leave,
would you hand me my purse?

11:38.239 --> 11:40.991
Mrs. Sussman, I promise you
we're gonna take very good care of you,

11:41.076 --> 11:43.243
but the snapping and the fetching,

11:43.328 --> 11:45.245
it's gonna be a problem.

11:50.251 --> 11:52.086
Can you help me with this?

11:57.592 --> 11:58.926
Thank you.

12:04.682 --> 12:08.018
I'm in Tehran. Yes, right now.

12:08.770 --> 12:11.271
No, yeah, sure, fine.

12:13.066 --> 12:15.359
Baby, I leave you
pretty fucking interesting messages,

12:15.443 --> 12:17.319
so, of course, you listen to mine.

12:18.363 --> 12:20.447
Jackie, would you tell Ellie

12:20.532 --> 12:22.991
that I'll pick her up
after her shift for dinner?

12:23.618 --> 12:25.577
-Work crisis.
-Sure.

12:29.332 --> 12:31.458
-Hey.
-Hey, are you free tonight?

12:31.543 --> 12:34.378
-I can't talk. Call you back?
-She's calling me back.

12:34.462 --> 12:36.296
-Are we doing this now?
-No, I don't know what we're doing.

12:36.381 --> 12:37.798
Right now I am working.

12:39.008 --> 12:41.593
-Don't break that.
-I got a whole bag in my office.

12:43.972 --> 12:46.849
Hi, Sarah Khouri.

12:46.933 --> 12:50.394
Yes, I have the antibiotics that I stole,

12:50.478 --> 12:53.313
but I can't administer them.

12:53.398 --> 12:57.025
Because I have no idea
where the frigging syringes are.

13:04.159 --> 13:06.493
Sam, can you come in here, please?

13:12.292 --> 13:15.669
This room needs to stay organized.

13:15.753 --> 13:17.921
Like container-store organized.

13:18.006 --> 13:24.261
Because, if I can't find 19-gauge needles
when we need them, we are screwed.

13:25.597 --> 13:27.806
Where are the 19-gauge needles?

13:28.516 --> 13:31.268
They're right here,
in the bin marked "Tongue Depressors."

13:32.854 --> 13:37.274
Okay. Okay. Okay.

13:40.445 --> 13:41.904
Clean this place up.

13:57.337 --> 13:59.463
Oh, my God, I'm totally freaking out.

13:59.547 --> 14:02.090
Do you have a minute to, like,

14:02.175 --> 14:04.218
listen to me
talk about boys and not judge?

14:11.976 --> 14:15.354
Okay, so it was three weeks...
No, it was four weeks ago.

14:15.438 --> 14:19.107
No, it was three weeks...
Earlier than four weeks when I thought

14:19.192 --> 14:20.526
was the first time I talked to him...

14:22.570 --> 14:24.780
She said she would meet
you after your shift.

14:26.699 --> 14:29.618
-She say anything else?
-To me? No, she was on the phone.

14:30.411 --> 14:32.246
Although, if I didn't know any better

14:32.330 --> 14:34.748
I would have sworn
she was on the phone with you.

14:36.543 --> 14:38.794
Yeah, well, one in every port.

14:40.421 --> 14:43.715
-I'm just saying.
-Well, yeah, I know. I know.

14:47.095 --> 14:48.136
Zoey?

14:48.221 --> 14:50.931
Can you take Mrs. Anderson
outside to wait for her cab?

14:53.017 --> 14:56.436
Absolutely. Let me just wash my hands.

15:00.108 --> 15:02.568
Okay, I have to get a cab. I'll be right back.

15:03.236 --> 15:06.572
If someone comes in, just tell them
you're here to go to the bathroom.

15:10.535 --> 15:11.577
Hey!

15:13.329 --> 15:16.832
-What are you doing later?
-It's safer if you don't know.

15:16.916 --> 15:20.794
Yeah, because you are
looking pretty dangerous in those scrubs.

15:22.171 --> 15:25.090
Last week I thought I'd be living
in my parents' rec room with a newborn,

15:25.174 --> 15:28.969
so I'm feeling like I should grab
everything by the balls.

15:29.804 --> 15:33.265
But it's confusing because I don't think
I'm really a ball grabber.

15:33.349 --> 15:34.600
I don't know.

15:36.436 --> 15:39.896
-Why are you listening? What do you want?
-I just want to take you out to dinner.

15:39.981 --> 15:42.399
We could, like, get some enchiladas
and chill or...

15:42.483 --> 15:44.109
Fine, maybe.

15:45.987 --> 15:48.822
Can you wait with her till her cab comes?
I've got some shit to take care of.

15:48.906 --> 15:50.157
Sure.

15:55.830 --> 15:57.164
"Fine, maybe."

16:04.047 --> 16:06.465
Okay, you can't jerk your arm back
or we won't be able to help you.

16:06.549 --> 16:08.925
-It hurts.
-You know what hurts?

16:09.010 --> 16:11.386
Having my authority
called into question because of my looks.

16:14.432 --> 16:15.807
What's your opinion?

16:15.892 --> 16:18.268
Just cut it off. Cut my finger off.

16:18.353 --> 16:19.853
Again, it's not appropriate.

16:19.937 --> 16:23.857
Come on, I'm asking you for your opinion.
Attractive man to attractive man.

16:25.193 --> 16:28.820
Okay. Honestly, I think you should smile
and tell people to go fuck themselves.

16:28.905 --> 16:30.364
So I should say something.

16:35.370 --> 16:37.954
All right, chief, next time
you get a manicure, do what I do.

16:38.039 --> 16:40.040
BYO cuticle clippers.

16:45.880 --> 16:46.922
Gotcha.

16:48.633 --> 16:51.510
-What?
-Really, Zoey, what the hell?

16:51.594 --> 16:56.390
I'm going to the bathroom.
I have a bladder infection.

16:57.975 --> 17:00.560
You are a terrible liar.

17:01.896 --> 17:03.105
I know.

17:05.149 --> 17:06.566
I'm sorry.

17:07.193 --> 17:08.568
Shit.

17:09.654 --> 17:11.196
You know it all, don't you?

17:11.698 --> 17:14.700
She has a brown recluse spider bite
that's gone untreated.

17:14.784 --> 17:18.328
There is blistering and the initial
indications of skin death around the mark.

17:18.413 --> 17:22.082
She didn't want to be admitted, so I

17:22.166 --> 17:26.670
pinched two 19-gauge needles and some
Augmentin from the supply closet.

17:29.298 --> 17:30.924
Get out of here.

17:35.221 --> 17:38.473
Well, I can give you two shots
in one cheek and you'll be sitting funny,

17:38.558 --> 17:41.268
or I can give you a shot in each cheek
and you won't be sitting at all.

17:42.562 --> 17:43.979
Surprise me.

17:50.778 --> 17:55.907
Look, I've been in the States
for just over two weeks with someone else.

17:56.033 --> 17:58.869
And I didn't want to have to tell Ellie
that I'd been here

17:58.953 --> 18:00.746
and not called her right away.

18:00.830 --> 18:02.289
Didn't want the questions.

18:04.500 --> 18:08.420
I know, the questions
would make you feel awful. I get it.

18:08.504 --> 18:11.923
-I really do get it.
-She knows.

18:13.009 --> 18:15.969
She maybe doesn't talk about it,
but this is what we do.

18:16.053 --> 18:18.054
This might be what you do.

18:18.139 --> 18:20.891
As if she isn't running around
with some boy half her age?

18:20.975 --> 18:23.685
Okay, she's my friend.

18:26.481 --> 18:27.856
Are you ready for this?

18:40.495 --> 18:42.245
Fuck! Fuck!

18:42.330 --> 18:43.705
You okay?

18:43.790 --> 18:46.166
Oh, God, that hurt.

18:47.043 --> 18:50.003
It knocks the wind out of you.
One more and you are done.

18:50.922 --> 18:52.756
It's not like I don't love her.

18:52.840 --> 18:54.132
I know.

18:54.217 --> 18:55.801
Are you ready?

18:55.885 --> 18:57.052
Nah.

19:00.765 --> 19:02.015
Okay, go ahead.

19:06.312 --> 19:08.814
I'm tired of people
walking in and out of here.

19:08.898 --> 19:11.274
-Don't you knock?
-No, we don't.

19:11.359 --> 19:13.568
But we will be discharging you
in just a few minutes.

19:13.653 --> 19:15.570
How wonderful.

19:16.280 --> 19:19.616
Would somebody call my driver
and tell him to pick me up here?

19:19.700 --> 19:22.035
I'm sorry, Mrs. Sussman, that's not my job.

19:22.703 --> 19:26.289
-Who says?
-I'm sorry, but I need to say something.

19:26.374 --> 19:29.417
I am a doctor. And I am good-looking.

19:29.502 --> 19:32.754
But there is no amount of money
that gives you the right to come in here

19:32.839 --> 19:35.632
and discredit me
in front of the people that I work with.

19:35.716 --> 19:37.634
Who the hell do you think you are?

19:37.718 --> 19:40.512
I don't know who you are.

19:40.596 --> 19:43.515
And I realize there are institutions
like All Saints

19:43.599 --> 19:45.767
that put people like you on a poster

19:45.852 --> 19:48.728
and make you feel important,
but you're not.

19:48.813 --> 19:53.441
Because it's people like me who make
doctors like you worthwhile at all.

19:53.526 --> 19:57.946
There are parts of this hospital
that wouldn't exist without my support.

19:58.239 --> 20:03.326
I built them up like that
and I can tear you down just as easily,

20:03.411 --> 20:06.246
you silly little runt.

20:06.330 --> 20:08.415
Oh, Jesus, God, Dr. Cooper.

20:09.917 --> 20:13.461
Take your hands off me.

20:13.546 --> 20:15.422
I wish that I could.

20:19.093 --> 20:20.927
Gloria, do you see this?

20:23.180 --> 20:27.767
Not one dime. Not one fucking dime.

20:32.440 --> 20:35.692
Let me get this straight.
You've done this before.

20:36.193 --> 20:37.485
-To her?
-Yes, he did.

20:37.570 --> 20:39.738
But to his credit,
he's never grabbed a patient.

20:39.822 --> 20:42.699
You know, before this.

20:42.783 --> 20:45.243
Do you know what will happen
if Libby pulls her funding?

20:45.328 --> 20:50.707
If she doesn't allocate anything
to the ER because of this, we're screwed!

20:50.791 --> 20:54.336
We are completely screwed!

20:54.420 --> 20:56.087
Okay, we can fix this.

20:59.467 --> 21:02.344
Here, have a sandwich.

21:05.681 --> 21:07.474
It may be your last.

21:11.020 --> 21:12.687
-Maybe I should...
-No.

21:14.815 --> 21:16.066
Need help!

21:18.194 --> 21:19.653
She's stroking out.

21:20.655 --> 21:22.572
A fucking bleed?
You have got to be kidding me.

21:22.657 --> 21:25.408
We ran every test, right?
Did we miss something?

21:25.493 --> 21:27.243
Fine motor problems? Slurring?

21:27.328 --> 21:29.329
Nothing. Don't just stand there.
Take over compressions.

21:29.413 --> 21:31.456
I don't think I should
go anywhere near her chest.

21:31.540 --> 21:32.916
Do your job.

21:33.000 --> 21:34.209
-Go.
-Here.

21:43.511 --> 21:44.719
Go, get the pads.

22:18.462 --> 22:23.049
The events leading up to her death
were unavoidable.

22:23.634 --> 22:26.761
And it is our responsibility
to carry out her dying wish,

22:27.555 --> 22:31.474
to take $1 billion from the children's wing
and give it to the ER, right?

22:31.559 --> 22:33.476
We all heard that, right?

22:36.397 --> 22:37.397
Right?

22:39.900 --> 22:41.568
-Hey.
-Hey.

22:42.069 --> 22:44.988
So listen, I need some time

22:45.072 --> 22:48.158
to figure out if you are the love of my life,

22:48.242 --> 22:51.453
or a pathological liar.

22:51.537 --> 22:54.581
And I don't think
that seeing you is going to help.

22:55.332 --> 22:58.501
Well, you keep moving the target
so I don't know what you expect.

22:58.586 --> 23:01.254
-What?
-First, you're single,

23:01.338 --> 23:04.632
then you're a single mother,
then you're married with two kids.

23:04.717 --> 23:07.177
Half the time I'm with you
I don't know what the fuck to think.

23:07.803 --> 23:09.512
You don't want me
to get too close, do you?

23:09.597 --> 23:13.141
No, I do. I just... I need to take a breath.

23:14.143 --> 23:15.852
Well, listen, take a couple.

23:15.936 --> 23:19.272
Just don't think I'm, you know,
sitting at home waiting by the phone.

23:20.441 --> 23:22.067
Yeah, where are you now?

23:23.736 --> 23:24.778
Home.

23:29.408 --> 23:32.327
Frank, no, pick us up
on the south side of the street.

23:32.411 --> 23:34.037
Yeah, no, south.

23:34.121 --> 23:36.247
Killer, we're right outside the hospital!

23:36.332 --> 23:38.041
Look, forget it, let's just get a cab.

23:38.125 --> 23:40.960
Fine. You know what? Go without me.

23:50.596 --> 23:53.264
Baby, I'm so glad you waited up.

23:53.349 --> 23:56.643
-I love it.
-We used to do this all the time.

23:57.645 --> 24:00.814
I'd stay up for you, you'd stay up for me,
we'd talk.

24:01.482 --> 24:03.983
-Remember that?
-Sure. Sure do.

24:05.528 --> 24:08.446
I'm serious. We don't do that anymore.

24:08.531 --> 24:11.241
I know, I know. We can do it right now.

24:16.288 --> 24:18.331
Boy, that was a great party.

24:19.834 --> 24:23.211
-Cake, great cake.
-Yes, great cake.

24:27.174 --> 24:31.177
What, you want to talk?
That's fine. All right, we'll talk. Go ahead.

24:32.012 --> 24:36.724
Stop checking things off your list.
I'm not something for you to get done.

24:39.353 --> 24:42.021
Wow. Jesus, Kev.

24:44.859 --> 24:48.903
You know why we had great cake, Jackie?

24:48.988 --> 24:51.948
Because while you were working,
I went out and got it.

24:52.032 --> 24:54.701
I know that, Kevin. I work.
I appreciate you going out...

24:54.785 --> 24:57.829
No, what you appreciate
is people doing whatever you want

24:57.913 --> 24:59.289
and not getting in your way.

24:59.373 --> 25:01.958
You want to stitch up our kid
in the kitchen?

25:02.042 --> 25:05.545
Go ahead. And I don't give
a fuck if your friend is a doctor.

25:05.629 --> 25:08.965
When I say I want to take
our daughter to the hospital, I mean it!

25:09.049 --> 25:12.635
-I know you mean it, Kevin...
-You don't listen to a fucking thing I say!

25:12.720 --> 25:18.057
"Get in the car, go to urgent care!
Take an extra day off."

25:18.142 --> 25:20.643
It's like I'm white noise
between you and wherever you're going.

25:20.728 --> 25:23.688
Wait a second, Kevin.
I have taken more time off in the last month

25:23.772 --> 25:25.648
than I have in the past two years.

25:25.733 --> 25:28.067
And that makes up for what?

25:28.152 --> 25:30.320
What is it I'm making up for, Kevin?

25:30.404 --> 25:32.780
You've taken five days off
in the last two years.

25:32.865 --> 25:34.282
Is that enough?

25:34.366 --> 25:36.743
Enough for what? What the fuck?

25:37.870 --> 25:40.580
It doesn't even matter
because most of the time when you're home

25:40.664 --> 25:43.082
you're not here.
I mean, yeah, you're standing here,

25:43.167 --> 25:46.628
but you're a million miles away.
I don't know where the fuck you go!

25:46.712 --> 25:49.255
I'm doing the best I can, Kevin!

25:49.340 --> 25:52.175
I go to work, I work really hard
and then I come home, okay?

25:52.259 --> 25:54.302
I always fucking come home.
I always come home.

25:54.386 --> 25:57.680
You always come home and then you
pretend like you didn't miss anything.

25:57.765 --> 26:00.225
And then you run around
and try and fix shit.

26:00.309 --> 26:02.810
You become a shitstorm
of "Fix it! Fix it! Fix it!"

26:02.895 --> 26:04.771
That's the last thing Gracie needs.

26:05.272 --> 26:07.357
Gracie? Who said anything about Gracie?

26:08.234 --> 26:10.526
You're not going to fucking put this on me.
Fuck you, Kevin.

26:10.611 --> 26:12.862
I don't make her anxious. I'm here.

26:12.947 --> 26:15.782
Of course you're here.
Where the hell else you gonna be?

26:15.866 --> 26:18.034
At a concert? At a fucking class?

26:18.118 --> 26:20.328
Reading a book somewhere?
No, this is where you are!

26:20.412 --> 26:22.789
This is where you were.
This is where you're always gonna be

26:22.873 --> 26:24.624
because you're a fucking bartender!

26:24.708 --> 26:26.709
You have no idea what my life is like!

26:26.794 --> 26:29.754
You have no idea
what it feels like to be me!

27:40.409 --> 27:44.537
Can I get a cup of coffee
and a piece of chocolate pie, please?

27:44.621 --> 27:45.705
Thank you.
