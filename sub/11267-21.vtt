"Bride and Prejudice"
Closed Captioned

00:01.794 --> 00:02.795
Previously on:

00:02.920 --> 00:05.881
How's that cute
surfer boy of yours?
You mean Caleb?

00:06.005 --> 00:07.299
He's already in
a committed relationship.

00:07.424 --> 00:10.344
He wants to become a priest.

00:10.469 --> 00:11.512
Our relationship
has been one big lie!

00:11.637 --> 00:13.722
Get your crap
and get the hell out!

00:13.848 --> 00:15.641
NAVID:
She took everything
in the register

00:15.766 --> 00:17.643
and all the money
in the production company.

00:17.768 --> 00:18.352
Hey, is Dixon home?

00:18.477 --> 00:19.227
NAVID:
Dixon went on tour

00:19.353 --> 00:21.563
with Haley Reinhart.

00:21.689 --> 00:23.774
I can't believe he left
without telling me.

00:23.899 --> 00:25.066
I appreciate you
coming with me

00:25.192 --> 00:26.527
last week to take
the cancer test.

00:27.945 --> 00:29.530
I'm so sorry.

00:33.659 --> 00:35.536
You have to tell her about
this marriage clause.
I can't.

00:35.661 --> 00:36.704
I don't want her to think

00:36.829 --> 00:38.288
that my feelings for her
have anything to do

00:38.413 --> 00:38.956
with the fact
that I could lose everything.

00:39.080 --> 00:40.749
I'm engaged!

00:45.004 --> 00:46.714
PJ:
Keep staring at that,

00:46.839 --> 00:48.465
you could go blind.

00:48.590 --> 00:49.842
You're leaving me?

00:49.967 --> 00:52.720
I got a standing match and lunch
at the Jonathan Club downtown.

00:54.555 --> 00:56.515
But...

00:56.640 --> 00:58.350
I can cancel if you'd like.

00:58.475 --> 01:00.394
(chuckles)
No, go have your fun.

01:00.519 --> 01:03.146
I will patiently
wait your return.

01:03.271 --> 01:04.690
You have no way
of knowing this,

01:04.815 --> 01:07.818
but I've been searching
for you my entire life.

01:07.943 --> 01:10.529
If you hadn't come just when you
did, I don't know where I'd be.

01:10.654 --> 01:13.156
(chuckles)

01:14.074 --> 01:16.284
(chuckles)

01:16.410 --> 01:18.579
(sighs) I am...
(clears throat)

01:18.704 --> 01:20.539
I've been meaning to talk
to you about something.

01:20.664 --> 01:24.626
Um, it's a weird
family thing, actually.

01:26.045 --> 01:27.880
Come on.
You can tell me anything.

01:31.132 --> 01:32.384
How do you feel about

01:32.509 --> 01:34.177
legally changing your name
to Hillingsbrook?

01:34.302 --> 01:37.264
It's a big deal
to my parents

01:37.389 --> 01:41.142
to have the family name
and keep the tradition alive.

01:41.268 --> 01:43.311
Naomi Hillingsbrook.

01:43.437 --> 01:45.814
(giggles)
I like the sound of that.

01:45.940 --> 01:47.858
What do you say,
Mr. Hillingsbrook?

01:47.983 --> 01:50.402
You want to
come back to bed?
Mm-hmm.

01:58.410 --> 01:59.453
Hey.

01:59.578 --> 02:01.455
Hey.

02:01.580 --> 02:06.167
Well... that was unexpected.

02:06.293 --> 02:08.419
Oh, my God!
Is that what time it is?!

02:08.544 --> 02:09.964
What, do you not
have an alarm clock?

02:10.089 --> 02:13.008
I work in a bar.

02:13.133 --> 02:15.886
(sighs, laughs nervously)

02:16.011 --> 02:17.721
Annie and Naomi
are going to be at my place

02:17.846 --> 02:19.306
in like, two minutes.

02:19.431 --> 02:21.182
I'm going to be
so late.

02:21.308 --> 02:22.476
Okay...

02:23.602 --> 02:25.270
I think your top
is on backwards.

02:25.395 --> 02:26.354
What? Oh no.

02:26.480 --> 02:27.648
(sighs)
I really got to go.

02:29.942 --> 02:32.277
Hey, um, about last night,
that was...

02:32.402 --> 02:34.571
Something we are never ever
going to talk about again,

02:34.696 --> 02:36.239
right?
Right.

02:36.364 --> 02:37.825
Okay, good, great.

02:37.950 --> 02:39.118
We'll just pretend, like,

02:39.242 --> 02:41.495
it never happened.

02:47.417 --> 02:48.543
NAVID:
Ade, you can't just pack up

02:48.669 --> 02:50.087
and leave without
talking to Dixon.

02:50.211 --> 02:52.255
Why not? Dixon did.

02:52.380 --> 02:53.632
Well, okay, he made a mistake.

02:53.757 --> 02:55.342
You know how important
music is to him.

02:55.467 --> 02:58.012
More important than me?

02:58.386 --> 03:00.388
Dixon had a stroke, okay?

03:00.514 --> 03:02.349
I gave up music to save his life

03:02.474 --> 03:04.434
and he still chose his career
over everything else.

03:04.559 --> 03:05.769
I just... I want to get
my stuff out of here

03:05.894 --> 03:08.730
while he's touring around
with Haley Reinhart.

03:08.856 --> 03:11.775
It's over. And this
is my blender.
(groans)

03:13.276 --> 03:14.486
Ade, when I told you

03:14.611 --> 03:16.030
I was excited
to go to Princeton,

03:16.155 --> 03:17.948
you knew I was lying.

03:18.073 --> 03:20.742
Because you knew I loved Silver
just like I know you love Dixon.

03:20.868 --> 03:22.410
Okay, well apparently
we are both idiots

03:22.536 --> 03:24.245
because we love people
that don't love us back.

03:24.371 --> 03:25.413
Well, Silver just texted me.

03:25.539 --> 03:27.041
She wants to meet for lunch.

03:27.166 --> 03:29.126
And I don't know if we're
getting back together,

03:29.250 --> 03:30.752
but at least the door
is still open.

03:30.878 --> 03:32.171
Okay, well, the only door
I'm interested in right now

03:32.295 --> 03:33.922
is the one out of here.

03:35.883 --> 03:37.718
Fine, if that's
how you feel.

03:42.056 --> 03:43.598
How y'all doing?

03:49.146 --> 03:51.065
(Annie sighs)

03:51.190 --> 03:52.024
Where is she?

03:52.149 --> 03:53.441
What do I look like?

03:53.567 --> 03:54.234
Her nanny?

03:54.359 --> 03:56.361
(cell phone rings)
Oh, oh.

03:56.486 --> 03:58.822
Hey, that-that's my phone.

03:58.947 --> 04:01.658
Finally,
where are you, Silver?

04:01.783 --> 04:03.535
Oh, hello, Caleb.

04:03.660 --> 04:05.787
No... it's Naomi,

04:05.913 --> 04:07.539
Annie's beautiful,
but engaged, friend.

04:07.664 --> 04:09.124
Did you want to speak to her?

04:09.249 --> 04:10.417
(whispering):
I'm not here.

04:10.542 --> 04:12.502
Actually, she just
stepped away.

04:12.627 --> 04:13.962
Probably off
praying somewhere.

04:14.088 --> 04:15.964
You two have
a lot in common.

04:16.089 --> 04:17.216
I will tell her
you called.

04:17.339 --> 04:19.801
Okay. (chuckles)
Bye.

04:19.927 --> 04:21.845
I'm pretty sure
you're going to burn in hell.

04:21.970 --> 04:23.430
Hi...

04:23.555 --> 04:25.557
I'm sorry I'm late.
I was at...

04:25.682 --> 04:27.559
at yoga class.

04:27.684 --> 04:30.270
In the same clothes that you
wore to Raj's funeral bonfire.

04:32.397 --> 04:34.233
Oh, my God. You're doing the
full-on walk of shame right now.

04:35.650 --> 04:37.152
(gasps) You got back together
with Navid.

04:37.277 --> 04:38.153
(chuckles)
Oh, you so did.

04:38.278 --> 04:40.697
Oh, come on, Silver.

04:40.822 --> 04:42.699
I mean, it's you. It's not
like you're going to have

04:42.824 --> 04:44.118
skanky bar sex
with some "rando."
Yeah.

04:44.243 --> 04:46.120
(chuckles)
Yeah, it was Navid.

04:46.245 --> 04:47.788
NAOMI:
I knew it.

04:47.913 --> 04:48.538
(laughs)

04:48.663 --> 04:50.457
Honey, why are you
being so weird?

04:50.582 --> 04:52.042
You guys were meant
for each other.

04:52.167 --> 04:53.543
It's like me and Liam,
except in a good way.

04:56.964 --> 04:58.590
You're right.
I saw him last night.

04:58.715 --> 05:01.468
And I realized
how much I missed him.

05:01.593 --> 05:03.887
We've been through
so much together.

05:04.012 --> 05:06.514
And he's always
been there for me. I...

05:06.640 --> 05:08.475
I always imagined
that he'd be in my life.

05:08.600 --> 05:11.103
What can I say?
I love him.

05:11.228 --> 05:14.106
(both chuckle)
And he adores you.

05:14.231 --> 05:16.608
That is the second best news
I've heard in the last 24 hours.

05:16.733 --> 05:18.401
What's the best?

05:18.526 --> 05:19.987
(clears throat)

05:20.112 --> 05:21.947
I'm getting married.

05:22.072 --> 05:24.741
(Naomi laughs)

05:26.451 --> 05:28.120
ANNIE:
All I can say is "wow."

05:28.245 --> 05:29.955
It's beautiful.

05:30.080 --> 05:31.039
(sighs)
And I'm going to need
my bridesmaids

05:31.165 --> 05:33.292
to clear their
social calendars.

05:33.416 --> 05:35.794
PJ and I will be tying the knot
in two weeks.

05:35.919 --> 05:37.545
Two weeks?

05:37.671 --> 05:38.588
NAOMI:
Yes, it was PJ's idea.

05:38.713 --> 05:40.507
He wants me to have everything
I want.

05:40.632 --> 05:41.633
It's going to be fabulous.

05:41.758 --> 05:43.302
Why two weeks?
What's the rush?

05:43.426 --> 05:45.428
You're not pregnant,
are you?

05:45.553 --> 05:46.972
Oh, good God, no.

05:47.097 --> 05:48.723
(scoffs)
Yes, it's a little rushed,

05:48.849 --> 05:50.934
so it won't be quite
as big as I had hoped.

05:51.059 --> 05:52.727
But that's the thing
I love about PJ.

05:52.853 --> 05:54.479
He can pull off
the most extravagant things

05:54.604 --> 05:55.981
at the drop of a hat.

05:56.106 --> 05:57.065
Hey, it's Navid.

05:57.191 --> 05:59.358
I'm supposed
to meet him for lunch.

05:59.484 --> 06:00.986
Unbelievable. He wants
to meet at the Offshore.

06:01.111 --> 06:02.487
What's wrong with Offshore?

06:02.612 --> 06:05.324
Nothing.
I just need to leave now.

06:05.448 --> 06:07.826
Well, your dress
looks beautiful.

06:07.951 --> 06:08.994
You may go.

06:09.119 --> 06:09.911
Thank you.
(laughs)

06:10.037 --> 06:10.954
ANNIE:
Bye.

06:11.079 --> 06:13.040
(sighs)

06:13.165 --> 06:16.293
Um... we need to talk.

06:16.417 --> 06:17.919
It's about PJ.

06:19.087 --> 06:20.964
What about PJ?

06:21.089 --> 06:23.508
Okay, uh, I should have
told you this a while ago.

06:23.633 --> 06:25.593
But I only found out
because of the charity work

06:25.719 --> 06:27.386
and PJ told me
not to say anything.

06:27.512 --> 06:29.639
And then I came home
and you were engaged.

06:29.764 --> 06:31.558
(scoffs)
Annie, would you
spit it out, please?

06:34.602 --> 06:37.272
PJ has to get married
in two weeks

06:37.438 --> 06:39.900
or he'll lose
all of his money.

06:40.025 --> 06:42.027
It's written into
his trust fund.

06:42.152 --> 06:43.987
That's why he wants
to get married so quick.

06:49.408 --> 06:50.535
Is that all?

06:50.660 --> 06:52.787
Uh...

06:52.913 --> 06:54.248
What do you mean,
is that all?

06:54.373 --> 06:56.833
Annie, PJ is very wealthy.

06:56.958 --> 06:59.002
Wealthy families are weird.

06:59.127 --> 07:00.461
You're nouveau riche.

07:00.587 --> 07:02.089
You haven't had a chance
to get weird yet.

07:02.214 --> 07:04.465
What you have
to understand is

07:04.591 --> 07:07.468
anyone with PJ's wealth is going
to have a complicated trust.

07:07.594 --> 07:09.346
Besides, it's a lot of money.
Who would want to lose it?

07:09.470 --> 07:12.599
Okay, but doesn't it
make you wonder

07:12.724 --> 07:14.559
if...
Wonder if what?

07:14.684 --> 07:17.645
If I'm not getting everything
I've ever wanted in a guy?

07:17.771 --> 07:20.607
PJ is smart
and charming, handsome.

07:20.732 --> 07:21.983
I could have my perfect career,

07:22.109 --> 07:23.318
my perfect guy,
my perfect life.

07:23.443 --> 07:24.861
That's what I always dreamed of.

07:24.986 --> 07:26.613
He did tell me
that you were the one.

07:26.738 --> 07:27.906
He loves me.

07:28.031 --> 07:29.699
And I love him.

07:29.824 --> 07:31.743
And it is not about the money.

07:49.552 --> 07:50.470
Hey!

07:52.097 --> 07:53.223
Hey, just getting back
in the water? Sweet!

07:53.348 --> 07:54.599
Yeah, there's a
big south running.

07:54.724 --> 07:57.060
So, I thought it was a good time
to get back out there.

07:57.185 --> 07:59.729
Sure, I always felt like the
ocean has something of a...

07:59.854 --> 08:01.648
healing quality.
I know it does for me.

08:01.773 --> 08:03.942
Can I ask you a question?

08:04.067 --> 08:04.525
Yeah, sure.

08:04.651 --> 08:07.612
Is Annie pissed at me
for some reason?

08:07.737 --> 08:09.323
Nah, I don't think so.

08:09.448 --> 08:11.741
At the wake, she said she was
having problems with her friend.

08:11.866 --> 08:14.161
I thought she was really
talking about a guy.

08:14.286 --> 08:16.537
Is she seeing someone?

08:16.663 --> 08:18.665
No, she's not.

08:18.790 --> 08:21.042
Called her a couple times
and she's ducked me,

08:21.168 --> 08:23.170
so I thought...
maybe it was something I said.

08:23.295 --> 08:25.088
Oh, no, probably not.

08:25.213 --> 08:26.881
But she's at the house
if you want to stop by.

08:27.007 --> 08:28.591
Well, thanks.

08:28.716 --> 08:30.344
How are you doing?

08:30.469 --> 08:33.472
How do you think
I'm doing, Caleb?

08:33.596 --> 08:35.932
My husband just died.
Life sucks right now.

08:36.057 --> 08:38.518
Ivy, if you ever need to talk...

08:38.643 --> 08:40.312
Yeah, I appreciate that,

08:40.437 --> 08:42.438
but I don't really know
what there is to talk about.

08:42.605 --> 08:44.316
Talking is not going
to change anything.

08:44.441 --> 08:45.484
It is what it is.

08:45.608 --> 08:46.693
Life is short,
and then it ends.

08:46.818 --> 08:49.196
So, I'm just going to do
what I want to do.

08:49.321 --> 08:50.864
If you don't mind right now,
I just want to surf.

08:50.989 --> 08:52.115
You came to the right place.

08:52.240 --> 08:53.867
It's firing out there.

08:53.992 --> 08:56.077
Have fun.

08:57.537 --> 09:02.083
(tires screeching)

09:04.585 --> 09:07.088
(theme music playing)

09:21.395 --> 09:22.687
IVY:
Are you kidding me?

09:22.812 --> 09:24.605
(chuckles)
Naomi's getting married
in two weeks?

09:24.731 --> 09:27.734
She said she's okay with it.
(chuckles)

09:27.859 --> 09:30.320
Wow.

09:30.445 --> 09:32.655
Well, I've heard of guys
marrying for money,

09:32.780 --> 09:34.366
just not with
their own money.

09:34.491 --> 09:35.783
(chuckles)

09:36.535 --> 09:39.162
Hey, congratulations,
I guess.

09:39.287 --> 09:42.832
What's got her knickers
all in a twist?

09:42.957 --> 09:44.876
We were just talking
about your wedding.

09:45.001 --> 09:46.669
You have to admit,
it's all pretty sudden.

09:46.794 --> 09:48.838
Okay, first you
and Silver. Now her?

09:48.963 --> 09:51.383
Could everyone stop being
so worried about this?

09:51.508 --> 09:53.593
PJ and I know what we're doing.

09:53.718 --> 09:56.388
We appreciate the concern,
but this is happening.

09:56.513 --> 09:59.391
Hey, we're all excited for you.

09:59.516 --> 10:01.268
You just have
to realize that,

10:01.393 --> 10:02.561
except for me,
no one even knows PJ.

10:02.685 --> 10:04.438
Right...

10:05.980 --> 10:07.357
That needs to change.

10:10.860 --> 10:13.696
I think we should arrive at the
church in a Rolls, don't you?

10:13.821 --> 10:17.492
Honey... we have a problem.

10:17.617 --> 10:18.868
You don't want a Rolls Royce?

10:18.993 --> 10:20.287
No, that's fine.

10:20.412 --> 10:21.079
So, what's the problem?

10:21.204 --> 10:22.330
My friends are.

10:24.082 --> 10:26.626
They think that I am rushing
into this wedding with you.

10:26.751 --> 10:28.503
And I was thinking about it
and I realize,

10:28.628 --> 10:29.879
it's because they don't
know you.

10:30.004 --> 10:31.005
They don't know us.

10:31.131 --> 10:32.799
Okay, so what do you suggest?

10:32.924 --> 10:35.385
Well, maybe we could do

10:35.510 --> 10:38.346
a small little
get-together?

10:38.472 --> 10:40.515
Something intimate, where they
can get to know the real you.

10:40.640 --> 10:41.015
An engagement party?

10:41.141 --> 10:42.142
That's perfect.

10:42.267 --> 10:43.935
I know just the venue.

10:44.060 --> 10:46.771
Okay, it can be fun,
but it has to be casual.

10:46.896 --> 10:48.773
I will start planning it
right away.

10:48.898 --> 10:50.733
No, no, no, no, no.

10:50.858 --> 10:52.569
You cannot plan
your own engagement party.

10:52.693 --> 10:54.862
That's as pathetic as wrapping
your own Christmas presents.

10:54.988 --> 10:56.114
I'll take care of it.

10:56.239 --> 10:59.951
You would do that for me?
(chuckles)

11:00.076 --> 11:01.286
Of course...

11:01.411 --> 11:03.455
And I'll get Wilson to help.

11:03.580 --> 11:07.417
(both laugh)

11:07.542 --> 11:10.462
Yeah, so my dad got
the criminal charges dropped.

11:10.587 --> 11:12.589
Yeah?
But the university
wasn't so cool about it.

11:12.713 --> 11:13.714
You got suspended?

11:13.840 --> 11:15.383
More like expelled.

11:15.509 --> 11:16.968
My dad is pissed.

11:17.093 --> 11:19.012
Gave me a month to get a job
or he's going to cut me off.

11:19.137 --> 11:20.763
Yeah, that's
pretty harsh.

11:20.888 --> 11:22.516
I'm just glad I kept up
with my rent here.

11:22.641 --> 11:24.476
I can't afford
to live anyplace else.

11:24.601 --> 11:25.602
Yeah, well, there's plenty
of space here.

11:25.726 --> 11:29.439
Dixon went on tour
with Haley Reinhart.

11:29.564 --> 11:31.650
Well, if it's a music thing,
how come Ade didn't go with him?

11:31.774 --> 11:32.609
Uh...

11:34.361 --> 11:35.487
They kind of broke up.

11:38.031 --> 11:39.115
Really?

11:39.240 --> 11:40.200
Yeah.

11:40.325 --> 11:41.201
Professionally or personally?

11:41.326 --> 11:44.037
(chuckles)
Both.

11:45.121 --> 11:46.789
Interesting.

11:46.914 --> 11:47.957
Yeah, I wouldn't
really say interesting.

11:48.082 --> 11:50.126
It's more, uh,
sad or tragic.

11:50.251 --> 11:52.420
Tragic for Dixon.

11:52.546 --> 11:53.505
I mean the whole reason
he got together with Ade

11:53.630 --> 11:56.883
was because she made
his music better.

11:57.008 --> 11:57.800
And because
he loves here.

11:57.925 --> 11:59.135
Uh, apparently not.

11:59.260 --> 12:01.012
Because he's the one
that moved on, right?

12:01.137 --> 12:02.597
Which is crazy because,

12:02.721 --> 12:04.140
have you checked out Adrianna?

12:04.265 --> 12:06.851
Yeah, I have, uh...

12:06.976 --> 12:09.563
(chuckles) pretty sure
their relationship isn't over.

12:09.688 --> 12:12.815
As soon as Dixon gets back,
I think they'll be okay.

12:12.940 --> 12:16.777
Maybe, or Dixon's loss
is somebody else's gain.

12:17.904 --> 12:19.947
No, I'm cool. I have
to meet Silver for lunch.

12:20.073 --> 12:21.449
But thanks.

12:21.575 --> 12:23.868
In this case,
your loss is my gain.

12:23.993 --> 12:25.453
Cheers, buddy.

12:32.377 --> 12:34.295
Silver.

12:34.421 --> 12:36.005
Hey, I'm glad
you're here.

12:36.130 --> 12:37.965
I, um, actually wanted
to talk about last
night.

12:38.091 --> 12:39.092
I'm actually going
to meet Navid

12:39.217 --> 12:40.927
and we agreed not to
bring up last night.

12:41.052 --> 12:43.513
Yeah, um...

12:43.638 --> 12:47.100
Look, I think we both know
that what happened was, um...

12:47.225 --> 12:48.101
in the moment.

12:48.226 --> 12:50.186
Yeah, I mean, we were both
pretty emotional.

12:50.311 --> 12:52.313
Yeah. And I know
you probably think

12:52.439 --> 12:54.315
I was on some crazy rebound
after Vanessa.

12:54.441 --> 12:55.734
(sighs)
Um...

12:55.858 --> 12:57.652
You need to know
that for me...

12:59.904 --> 13:02.073
last night couldn't have
happened with just anyone.

13:02.198 --> 13:03.575
Don't...
Silver,

13:03.700 --> 13:04.701
I think I have feelings for you.

13:04.825 --> 13:06.494
(sighs)
And with all
you're going through,

13:06.620 --> 13:08.162
you should have someone
to be with.

13:08.288 --> 13:10.665
Um, but I have someone.

13:10.789 --> 13:12.125
It's Navid.

13:12.250 --> 13:14.294
Liam, I want Navid.

13:14.419 --> 13:16.212
NAVID:
Look, if you want me,

13:16.337 --> 13:17.464
I'm standing right here.

13:17.589 --> 13:18.590
Hey.
Hi.

13:18.715 --> 13:19.924
What are you guys
talking about?

13:20.049 --> 13:23.428
Um, the test results
came back.

13:23.553 --> 13:24.178
Yeah?

13:24.304 --> 13:26.514
I have the cancer gene.

13:31.311 --> 13:32.520
Oh, Silver, I'm...

13:32.646 --> 13:34.230
(sighs)

13:34.355 --> 13:36.357
I'm really sorry.

13:36.483 --> 13:40.320
You said to me you wished that
I'd stopped you from leaving.

13:40.445 --> 13:41.321
Well,

13:41.446 --> 13:44.741
I'm asking you now to stay.

13:44.865 --> 13:47.494
But not just as my friend. I
want more than that.

13:47.619 --> 13:48.827
Yeah.

13:48.953 --> 13:51.205
I want (sighs) you.

13:51.331 --> 13:52.373
I want you to move
back in with me.

13:52.499 --> 13:54.751
I want us.

14:11.892 --> 14:14.521
Cartoons and cereal--
breakfast of champions.

14:14.646 --> 14:15.814
Uh, Caleb...

14:15.938 --> 14:16.690
(laughs nervously)

14:16.815 --> 14:18.065
What are you doing here?

14:18.191 --> 14:19.108
Naomi let me in

14:19.233 --> 14:20.318
and I saw Ivy surfing.

14:20.443 --> 14:21.820
She said I should drop by.

14:21.944 --> 14:24.071
Ah.
You've been ducking me,
Annie Wilson.

14:24.197 --> 14:26.073
You know I got a big Surf
for Good fundraiser coming up.

14:26.199 --> 14:28.034
I could use your help.

14:28.159 --> 14:29.577
Yeah, I'm sorry.
I've just had a lot going on.

14:29.703 --> 14:30.704
I've been really busy.

14:30.829 --> 14:32.913
Yeah, you look super busy.

14:33.039 --> 14:35.667
(chuckles)
Sorry, I haven't returned
your calls.

14:35.792 --> 14:37.210
It's just that
Naomi's getting married

14:37.335 --> 14:38.753
and I've been
helping PJ organize

14:38.878 --> 14:40.087
this big engagement party,

14:40.213 --> 14:41.339
which is happening today

14:41.464 --> 14:43.049
and I haven't even
gotten her a gift yet.

14:43.174 --> 14:44.342
I mean, what are you supposed
to get the girl

14:44.467 --> 14:47.094
that's about to have literally
everything, right?

14:47.220 --> 14:50.765
Are you all right?

14:50.890 --> 14:53.518
I know this year's
been really rough on you.

14:53.643 --> 14:55.436
So I was worried when you
stopped returning my calls.

14:55.562 --> 14:57.522
I thought
we kind of connected.

14:57.647 --> 14:59.982
So, if you need
to talk...
I don't.

15:00.107 --> 15:02.861
I just really need to stop
being distracted by everybody.

15:05.321 --> 15:06.781
Okay. That's cool.

15:06.906 --> 15:08.658
I guess we'll just talk
about charity stuff

15:08.783 --> 15:09.283
when you have time.

15:09.409 --> 15:10.785
I'm going
to take off.

15:10.910 --> 15:12.537
Bye.

15:15.707 --> 15:17.375
Annie, are we okay?

15:17.500 --> 15:18.668
We're good.

15:18.793 --> 15:20.336
I just really have to get going.

15:25.091 --> 15:26.384
(sighs)

15:26.509 --> 15:29.178
And how is

15:29.303 --> 15:30.096
His Holy Hotness?

15:30.221 --> 15:31.723
What makes you think

15:31.848 --> 15:33.015
it's okay
to invite him over

15:33.140 --> 15:34.809
when you know
I'm trying to avoid him?

15:34.934 --> 15:36.102
And remind me

15:36.227 --> 15:37.562
why you're trying
to avoid him?

15:37.687 --> 15:39.105
Uh, because I like him.

15:39.230 --> 15:40.440
That almost makes sense.

15:40.565 --> 15:42.567
It makes sense because I know

15:42.692 --> 15:44.569
he could never feel the same way
about me.

15:44.694 --> 15:46.487
You sure?
What if he did?

15:46.613 --> 15:48.698
Ivy, he's becoming a priest.

15:48.823 --> 15:51.158
Well, when I found out Raj had
cancer, it didn't make sense

15:51.284 --> 15:52.786
to fall in love with him,
but I did.

15:52.911 --> 15:54.412
Love finds you, you know?
You don't get to choose.

15:54.537 --> 15:56.539
I don't know.
Dude, life is short.

15:56.664 --> 15:57.957
If I were you, I'd hop on that

15:58.082 --> 16:00.334
before he's gone.

16:02.754 --> 16:05.131
I see you got
your old job back.

16:05.256 --> 16:06.090
(chuckles)

16:06.215 --> 16:07.675
I'm helping Liam.

16:07.801 --> 16:09.510
Vanessa cleaned him out

16:09.636 --> 16:11.805
and broke his heart,
so, he needs me.

16:11.930 --> 16:13.514
At least somebody does.

16:13.640 --> 16:15.558
Yeah, that's too bad about
what happened with Liam,

16:15.683 --> 16:17.936
but, uh, I'm actually
here to see you.

16:18.060 --> 16:19.270
(chuckles)

16:19.395 --> 16:20.313
I think Dix did you a favor.

16:20.438 --> 16:22.106
What do you mean?

16:22.231 --> 16:23.483
Well, between you and me,

16:23.608 --> 16:25.151
I think you're
the real talent,

16:25.276 --> 16:26.527
and I think
you should go solo.

16:26.653 --> 16:28.780
(laughs)
Okay, that's sweet, Austin,

16:28.905 --> 16:30.197
but I already tried that.

16:30.323 --> 16:31.574
You ever try going country?

16:31.699 --> 16:32.909
Hmm?
Trust me.

16:33.033 --> 16:34.577
Okay, you put
a little twang

16:34.702 --> 16:36.496
behind that
beautiful voice of yours,

16:36.621 --> 16:38.080
get the right person
behind you,

16:38.205 --> 16:40.625
and (snaps fingers) boom,
you got magic.

16:40.750 --> 16:43.294
(chuckles)
And who exactly is
the right person?

16:43.419 --> 16:44.921
Me.

16:45.045 --> 16:47.966
My dad is Judd Ridge,
Nashville legend.

16:48.090 --> 16:50.176
There isn't a door in that town
I can't walk through.

16:50.301 --> 16:51.511
It's a whole new scene.

16:51.636 --> 16:54.096
It'd be a fresh start
for you.

16:54.221 --> 16:55.682
Look,

16:55.807 --> 16:56.557
listen to this,
and tell me I'm wrong.

16:56.683 --> 17:00.227
Ade, I need to get
my job on, okay?

17:00.353 --> 17:02.146
And you need to get back
to doing what you do best.

17:02.271 --> 17:04.231
I can make that happen.

17:04.357 --> 17:07.484
I don't know.
What's Dixon going to think?

17:07.609 --> 17:10.404
Do you really care
what Dix thinks?

17:12.031 --> 17:13.700
You know what? No.
No.

17:13.825 --> 17:15.034
I don't.
(chuckles)
That's right.

17:15.159 --> 17:15.952
You don't.
I'm in.

17:16.076 --> 17:17.494
Yes, you are. Ow!
(chuckles)

17:17.619 --> 17:18.287
All right, beautiful.

17:18.412 --> 17:20.498
See ya.

17:20.623 --> 17:22.666
ANNIE:
And last but not least,
you've got the champagne, right?

17:22.791 --> 17:24.417
Dom Perignon. 15 cases.

17:24.544 --> 17:25.670
Thanks.

17:25.795 --> 17:27.881
And I have just one last favor
to ask you.

17:28.006 --> 17:28.840
Go ahead.
PJ ordered

17:28.965 --> 17:30.299
this big ice sculpture
that they need to pick up

17:30.424 --> 17:32.051
and take down to the party.

17:32.176 --> 17:33.427
Can you take care
of that for me?

17:33.553 --> 17:34.929
Yeah, but those things
are kind of heavy.

17:35.054 --> 17:36.014
It sounds like
a two-man job.

17:36.138 --> 17:37.056
That's why I got you
a helper.

17:37.181 --> 17:38.975
Oh, really? Who?

17:39.099 --> 17:40.142
I heard about Vanessa.

17:40.267 --> 17:42.144
Man, that's rough.

17:45.189 --> 17:46.566
You okay?

17:46.691 --> 17:49.276
Yeah, well, having a girl
that I thought loved

17:49.402 --> 17:50.904
lie to me
and steal all my money.

17:51.029 --> 17:52.655
It was definitely
not what I expected.

17:52.780 --> 17:54.657
Yeah, that's got to mess
with your head.

17:54.782 --> 17:56.450
Yeah, I'll be okay.

17:56.576 --> 17:58.786
You know what
helps with that?

17:58.912 --> 18:00.997
Some sloppy down-and-dirty
rebound sex.

18:01.121 --> 18:02.707
(tires screech)
Whoa, whoa!

18:02.832 --> 18:04.584
Hey, ass-wipe, watch
where you're going next time!

18:06.961 --> 18:08.379
Did you see that guy
cut me off?

18:13.676 --> 18:14.343
By the way,

18:14.468 --> 18:16.054
I wanted to apologize again

18:16.178 --> 18:18.806
about coming between you and PJ
about the trust fund thing.

18:18.932 --> 18:20.516
Mm-hmm.
I don't know why I assumed

18:20.641 --> 18:21.225
that it couldn't
be true love,

18:21.350 --> 18:23.352
but I'm really sorry.

18:23.477 --> 18:25.646
Honestly, it's not
that big of a deal,

18:25.772 --> 18:27.565
but apology accepted.

18:27.690 --> 18:28.983
You look gorgeous,
by the way.

18:29.108 --> 18:31.861
Okay, now you're starting to lay
the apology on a little thick.

18:31.986 --> 18:33.947
I mean it.
You look really pretty.

18:34.072 --> 18:35.322
What are you using?

18:35.448 --> 18:37.533
It's Rimmel ScandalEyes
mascara.

18:37.658 --> 18:39.159
It is from London.
(chuckles)

18:39.285 --> 18:40.119
I've been seeing it everywhere.
I had to pick it up.

18:40.244 --> 18:42.288
Let me try.
Oh!

18:42.413 --> 18:44.206
Speaking of scandals,

18:44.331 --> 18:46.292
what's going on
with you and Cardinal Caleb?

18:46.417 --> 18:48.878
(sighs)
It's a mess, actually.

18:49.003 --> 18:50.254
I think I really
hurt his feelings

18:50.379 --> 18:51.422
when he came by
this morning.

18:51.547 --> 18:53.925
And then I got
into it with Ivy.

18:54.050 --> 18:57.053
She thinks I should just
tell Caleb how I really feel.

18:57.177 --> 18:58.345
And what do you think?

18:58.471 --> 19:00.932
I think that if I tell him
I'm crushing on him

19:01.057 --> 19:02.516
and he responds the way
I think he will,

19:02.642 --> 19:05.144
then it could be the most
humiliating moment of my life.

19:05.269 --> 19:06.896
I get that.

19:07.021 --> 19:08.106
Don't you think you'll feel
better if you just come clean?

19:08.272 --> 19:09.649
I mean, you were convinced

19:09.774 --> 19:11.484
that things between me and PJ
were going to be ruined

19:11.609 --> 19:13.444
if you told me
about the trust fund,

19:13.569 --> 19:15.613
and look what happened.

19:15.738 --> 19:17.531
(chuckles)
I'll think about it.

19:18.908 --> 19:20.785
There is something
I've been meaning to ask you.

19:20.910 --> 19:22.036
What?

19:22.161 --> 19:24.497
Annie Wilson, will you be
my maid of honor?

19:24.622 --> 19:26.582
(gasps)
Me?! Are you sure?

19:26.707 --> 19:28.208
Yes.

19:28.334 --> 19:30.128
You've been an amazing friend.
PJ loves you.

19:30.252 --> 19:31.879
You're the reason
that we met each other.

19:32.005 --> 19:33.213
(sighs)
Please?

19:33.339 --> 19:35.549
Yes, I'd love to!
(squeals)

19:35.675 --> 19:36.884
Okay, no crying.

19:37.010 --> 19:38.552
You're going to ruin
your mascara.

19:38.678 --> 19:40.179
(sniffles)
Thank you.

19:40.304 --> 19:42.598
And thank you for helping keep
this get-together understated.

19:42.723 --> 19:44.892
Finally, everyone
is going to see

19:45.018 --> 19:46.936
that PJ and I love each other.

19:47.061 --> 19:48.062
And it's not just
because of his money.

Naomi, I want you to meet one of
my old friends, Richard Buxton.

21:01.677 --> 21:03.721
We went to boarding school
together.

21:03.846 --> 21:04.471
Well, I just couldn't
wait to meet you--

21:04.597 --> 21:06.140
the girl that bagged
the elephant.

21:06.265 --> 21:07.558
Excuse me?
(PJ chuckles)

21:07.683 --> 21:09.560
Talk about getting it in

21:09.685 --> 21:11.771
We've all been wondering
who the lucky girl would be.

21:11.896 --> 21:13.564
I approve, Preston.

21:13.689 --> 21:15.566
You found an
absolutely charming way

21:15.691 --> 21:16.316
to have your cake

21:16.442 --> 21:18.318

what are you doing here?

21:41.050 --> 21:43.552
Apparently, Naomi told PJ
that I was in the seminary

21:43.677 --> 21:44.887
and insist that I be here.

21:45.012 --> 21:46.346
Something about
a christening.

21:46.472 --> 21:48.474
I don't see
any babies around,

21:48.599 --> 21:49.976
so I'm thinking
it's the boat.

21:50.101 --> 21:51.978
Looks like he thought
of everything.

21:52.103 --> 21:53.271
Speaking of thinking
of everything,

21:53.395 --> 21:54.688
did you find
that gift for Naomi?

21:54.814 --> 21:56.440
Oh, no. No, I forgot!

21:56.565 --> 21:58.525
And I'm the maid of honor,
damn it!

21:58.651 --> 22:00.360
We can't have
the maid of honor

22:00.486 --> 22:03.823
showing up
without a gift.

22:03.948 --> 22:06.033
You're always looking out
for me, aren't you?

22:07.451 --> 22:09.620
They're South Sea black pearls.

22:09.745 --> 22:11.747
Polynesian legend says
they bring good luck

22:11.872 --> 22:12.915
to couples in love.

22:13.040 --> 22:14.708
Caleb...

22:14.834 --> 22:16.877
You're not gonna find
a better gift that says,

22:17.003 --> 22:20.464
"This was a love
that's meant to be."

22:20.589 --> 22:22.716
No.

22:22.842 --> 22:25.219
I thought you needed a gift?

22:25.343 --> 22:27.680
I do, but I can't.

22:27.805 --> 22:28.639
Why?

22:29.974 --> 22:31.309
Annie, you can tell me.

22:31.433 --> 22:33.602
Well, what's wrong is...
I don't know.

22:33.727 --> 22:35.604
I feel like I'm falling in love
with you!

22:37.731 --> 22:40.776
Which I know is never ever
gonna work.

22:40.901 --> 22:42.611
And to be honest,
it's kind of killing me

22:42.736 --> 22:43.863
trying to be your friend.

22:43.988 --> 22:46.615
I'm sorry, but it's the truth.

22:49.035 --> 22:50.410
I have to go.

22:58.294 --> 23:01.630
(footsteps approach)

23:01.755 --> 23:05.467
Naomi, your handsome fiancé
is up there alone.

23:05.592 --> 23:07.845
What are you doing?

23:07.970 --> 23:09.805
Silver, how do you know
Navid's the one for you?

23:09.930 --> 23:12.474
(chuckles)

23:12.599 --> 23:14.101
I don't know.

23:14.227 --> 23:16.603
I mean, I just do.

23:16.729 --> 23:18.105
But I don't think

23:18.231 --> 23:20.816
you can ever
really be certain.

23:20.941 --> 23:23.361
Sometimes you just gotta

23:23.485 --> 23:25.487
trust your feelings
and jump in.

23:25.612 --> 23:27.573
I'm not really
helping, am I?

23:27.698 --> 23:29.200
What's wrong?

23:29.325 --> 23:30.201
Nothing.

23:30.326 --> 23:32.245
Everything.

23:35.081 --> 23:36.916
It's the trust fund.

23:37.041 --> 23:38.667
At first, it really
didn't bother me,

23:38.792 --> 23:42.796
but then PJ threw
this big, lavish party,

23:42.922 --> 23:44.840
and now everything seems
to be about

23:44.965 --> 23:46.633
"sparing no expense."

23:46.759 --> 23:49.678
And it's just left me
thinking...

23:49.803 --> 23:50.888
Is it the money
or is it love?

23:51.013 --> 23:53.515
Yeah.

23:53.640 --> 23:55.101
The fact is, the only reason

23:55.226 --> 23:57.311
someone wouldn't tell you
the truth

23:57.435 --> 23:58.562
is because the truth
would destroy you.

24:01.148 --> 24:02.816
But I love him.

24:02.942 --> 24:06.195
The more important thing...

24:06.320 --> 24:08.364
does PJ really love you?

24:08.488 --> 24:10.408
(footsteps approaching)

24:10.532 --> 24:12.659
Uh! Hey, there
you guys are.

24:12.785 --> 24:14.954
Have either of you
seen Navid and Liam?

24:15.079 --> 24:17.831
Wait.
Liam and Navid are together?

24:19.792 --> 24:23.379
Oh, man, take a look
at this thing. Whoo!

24:23.503 --> 24:25.381
Okay, I'm sorry,
but this is beyond cheesy.

24:25.505 --> 24:28.842
(laughs)
Cheesy and heavy.

24:28.968 --> 24:30.594
Hey, help me tie
this down.
Oh, man.

24:30.719 --> 24:32.554
You got it?
Yeah.

24:32.679 --> 24:34.014
So how's Princeton?

24:34.140 --> 24:35.141
It's great.
Yeah?

24:35.266 --> 24:36.767
It's a dream come true.

24:36.892 --> 24:39.603
So what does that mean
for you and Silver?

24:39.728 --> 24:41.230
To be honest,
I'm not really sure.

24:41.355 --> 24:43.441
I mean, I want to be
there for her;

24:43.565 --> 24:44.900
there's no question
about that.

24:45.025 --> 24:46.277
But?

24:46.402 --> 24:47.611
Hey, you've known Silver

24:47.736 --> 24:48.779
through all the
cancer gene stuff.

24:48.904 --> 24:51.865
She's moving so fast.
I'm not sure she's ready.

24:51.991 --> 24:54.076
You think she means it?

24:54.201 --> 24:56.412
Well, she's been emotional
for sure, but you know,

24:56.536 --> 24:57.913
no one should have to deal with

24:58.038 --> 24:59.248
what she's dealing with
at our age.

24:59.373 --> 25:00.749
What do you think I should do?

25:00.874 --> 25:02.835
(sighs)

25:02.960 --> 25:04.420
Hey, that's tough.

25:04.544 --> 25:06.922
You know, on one hand, you
and Silver are great together.

25:07.047 --> 25:09.716
Everybody knows that.

25:09.842 --> 25:11.718
Silver's amazing.

25:11.844 --> 25:15.222
I think every guy would want
to be with a girl like her.

25:15.348 --> 25:18.100
I feel a "but on the other hand"
coming on.

25:18.225 --> 25:20.311
Well, it's just you guys
have a long history together,

25:20.436 --> 25:22.188
and not all
of it's good.

25:22.313 --> 25:23.689
I mean, you've broken up
and gotten back together,

25:23.814 --> 25:24.982
what, like,
three times now?

25:25.107 --> 25:26.442
(both chuckle)
I mean...

25:26.566 --> 25:27.567
I guess it's good

25:27.693 --> 25:29.653
you always work back
to each other in the end,

25:29.778 --> 25:30.654
but that on-again,
off-again deal

25:30.779 --> 25:31.864
usually ends badly.

25:31.989 --> 25:35.701
I'm just not sure that it's
worth giving up your dreams.

25:40.039 --> 25:43.417
So, what are you saying?

25:43.541 --> 25:46.420
I guess I'm saying that...

25:47.921 --> 25:50.548
I think you should go
back to Princeton.

25:53.593 --> 25:54.552
Let's get this back.

26:03.979 --> 26:05.481
(sighs)

26:05.605 --> 26:07.191
This feels so weird
being here without Dixon.

26:07.316 --> 26:09.235
You feel weird?

26:09.360 --> 26:11.195
This is my ex-girlfriend's
engagement party.

26:11.320 --> 26:12.405
(chuckles)

26:12.530 --> 26:14.281
Well, we can feel
weird together.

26:18.911 --> 26:20.913
BAND LEADER:
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
ladies and gentlemen.

26:21.038 --> 26:25.918
It looks like we got some real
talent in the house tonight.

26:26.043 --> 26:27.585
Adrianna Tate-Duncan,
everybody!

26:27.711 --> 26:28.628
(cheering and applause)

26:28.754 --> 26:30.423
Where's Dixon?

26:30.548 --> 26:32.966
Should we get up here
to sing a song together or what?

26:33.092 --> 26:34.718
I'm by myself.

26:34.843 --> 26:36.554
That's okay.
Come on up by yourself then.

26:36.678 --> 26:38.097
No, no, I couldn't.

26:38.222 --> 26:40.224
Oh, come on!
Now go on.

26:40.349 --> 26:42.768
It's the perfect chance to
try out that song I gave you.

26:42.893 --> 26:45.396
And sing a country song
that I've never sung before

26:45.521 --> 26:47.106
in front of all
these people?

26:47.231 --> 26:48.648
I can't do that alone.

26:48.774 --> 26:51.193
Well, maybe you don't have
to do it alone.

26:51.318 --> 26:52.736
Do you trust me?

26:52.861 --> 26:54.612
Yes.

26:54.738 --> 26:56.407
Well, come on.

Yes, all right!

Put your hands together

27:12.005 --> 27:13.424

27:13.549 --> 27:15.384
Okay, well, I would like

to someone very special.

because you're angry

to yourself, can you?

You can't stop me
from doing what I'm gonna do,

30:51.933 --> 30:54.394
and you can't watch over me
all the time, all right?

30:54.520 --> 30:57.105
Nobody can.
Oh, unless maybe God can.

behind Dixon's back.

totally messed up.

to make a scene.

31:14.456 --> 31:16.041
Hey, you guys okay?

31:16.166 --> 31:18.418

I broke that ice sculpture

four hours to get here.

39:18.315 --> 39:19.440
a danger to yourself.

39:19.565 --> 39:21.151
It's been filed by Caleb Walsh,

39:21.276 --> 39:22.277
a grief counselor
familiar with your case.

39:22.401 --> 39:24.946
You have got to be kidding me.

39:25.071 --> 39:26.531
I'm sorry, Ms. Sullivan,
but it's the law.

39:26.656 --> 39:28.366
I'm afraid
you don't have a choice.

39:34.873 --> 39:37.209
Hey.

39:37.334 --> 39:38.126
What are you
doing here?

39:38.251 --> 39:40.212
I came to say thank you.

39:40.337 --> 39:41.379
For what you did.

39:42.214 --> 39:43.882
Not saying anything.

39:44.841 --> 39:46.718
And, I guess...

39:46.843 --> 39:49.304
this is also good-bye.

39:51.597 --> 39:52.765
I'll see you around, then.

39:52.891 --> 39:54.893
Yeah. I'll see you.

40:02.859 --> 40:04.319
Why'd you do it?

40:04.443 --> 40:06.612
Why-why'd you
keep us a secret?

40:10.950 --> 40:12.869
I just wanted you to be happy.

40:14.371 --> 40:17.249
You are happy, aren't you?

40:17.374 --> 40:19.000
Yeah.

40:19.125 --> 40:20.626
Yeah, I am.

40:28.009 --> 40:29.552
Really?

40:43.482 --> 40:45.568
No, wait, Liam...

40:45.693 --> 40:46.945
Stop. This can't happen.

40:47.070 --> 40:48.529
I know.

40:48.654 --> 40:50.407
But don't tell me
that you don't have feelings.

40:52.284 --> 40:55.078
Don't ever tell me that
because you and I both know...

40:55.203 --> 40:57.455
that it's not true.
