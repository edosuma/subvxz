00:04.410 --> 00:07.376
Unlimited resources,
human test subjects...

00:07.406 --> 00:11.307
Bottom line, Doctor, we're looking to
continue Abraham Erskine's work.

00:11.337 --> 00:15.311
SHIELD wants supersoldiers,
and we want you on our team.

00:15.781 --> 00:16.972
When do I start?

00:17.153 --> 00:20.424
- Pull the plug, Doctor.
- I said not yet.

00:20.642 --> 00:23.748
This is my lab,
and I can control this.

00:24.176 --> 00:26.452
Can't you feel the power?

00:26.482 --> 00:28.864
Shut it down, Hall.
That's an order.

00:34.638 --> 00:36.538
Aah!

00:40.095 --> 00:42.613
Why am I in restraints?
What happened to my lab?

00:42.643 --> 00:43.984
It's okay, Franklin.

00:44.391 --> 00:47.316
There was an accident. We're concerned
that you may have been exposed...

00:47.346 --> 00:50.587
What do you mean accident?
I want to see my chart. I want...

00:50.617 --> 00:52.034
Aah!

00:55.275 --> 00:57.325
- Aah!
- I don't understand.

00:58.019 --> 00:59.255
What in the...

00:59.285 --> 01:01.758
[grunts]

01:02.165 --> 01:03.521
I'm doing this.

01:03.959 --> 01:06.054
I'm controlling gravity itself.

01:06.333 --> 01:08.880
[grunting]

01:12.671 --> 01:16.787
I want to see
Nick Fury right now.

Where am I?

01:38.299 --> 01:39.671
How long have I been here?

01:40.952 --> 01:45.580
Longer than me, and I have been
imprisoned here for six years.

01:49.263 --> 01:51.871

I want to treat you with the same
kindness that you've shown me.

03:11.201 --> 03:13.801
I'm going to take years
off of your life.

03:14.435 --> 03:17.178
[groaning]

03:18.233 --> 03:20.675
On second thought,
I'll take them all.

03:22.379 --> 03:24.617
[laughs]

03:24.994 --> 03:26.336
Whoa.

03:27.859 --> 03:29.637
Aah!

03:38.505 --> 03:39.771
[grunts]
Wasp.

03:39.801 --> 03:42.063
No time for small talk.
We got to move.

04:10.992 --> 04:13.931
Your power is impressive
for a mortal.

04:14.526 --> 04:17.165
Stand down now
before anyone is hurt,

04:17.195 --> 04:19.613
and you may yet
walk away from this.

04:20.153 --> 04:22.188
Fury called me Graviton.

04:22.218 --> 04:24.404
Fury, he knows.

04:24.434 --> 04:26.740
I can control gravity.

04:26.770 --> 04:28.955
I can do anything.

04:28.985 --> 04:32.106
I'll crush Fury.
I'll crush you.

04:32.595 --> 04:35.957
And then I'll show the world
the power I have.

04:36.251 --> 04:38.693
I think not, villain.

04:39.176 --> 04:41.392
Have at thee!

04:45.479 --> 04:47.123
Whoa! Whoa!

04:49.218 --> 04:50.500
Aah!

04:51.766 --> 04:53.394
[grunts]

04:54.208 --> 04:55.580
Ah, great.

04:55.821 --> 04:57.314
I'm never going
to get a taxi here.

04:57.344 --> 04:59.334
JARVIS, any news
from the helicarrier?

04:59.364 --> 05:00.962
- <i>Still sinking, sir.</i>
- Thanks.

05:00.992 --> 05:03.193
Open remote access
to the Chicago armory.

05:04.369 --> 05:05.892
<i>Remote access initiated.</i>

05:06.246 --> 05:08.401
<i>Activating MK VII armor now.</i>

05:19.947 --> 05:21.107
Huh?

05:22.834 --> 05:25.381
Hey, just waiting for my ride.

05:33.085 --> 05:34.985
Anything you'd like
to tell us, Fury?

05:36.447 --> 05:39.462
Not really. SHIELD command,
this is Director Nick Fury.

05:39.492 --> 05:41.708
I am declaring
an omega-level emergency.

05:41.919 --> 05:45.408
Every SHIELD agent, every
Hulkbuster unit, the U.S. Armed Forces,

05:45.438 --> 05:48.125
they are all now
under my direct control.

05:48.530 --> 05:51.198
Wow, Nick Fury
is actually worried.

05:51.417 --> 05:53.799
- Who is he?
- Dr. Franklin Hall.

05:53.965 --> 05:55.126
The physicist?

05:55.156 --> 05:57.643
No one's heard from him in years.
Not since he joined SHIELD.

05:58.434 --> 06:00.907
- What happened to him?
- That's classified.

06:02.218 --> 06:06.431
Really? Because I think it's about
to get unclassified pretty quick.

06:06.778 --> 06:09.763
[thunder rumbles]

06:14.126 --> 06:19.327
[grunts]

06:19.975 --> 06:21.121
No!

06:22.417 --> 06:26.262
Enough. This ends now!

06:29.942 --> 06:33.319
<i>[Reporter] Reports are coming in from</i>
<i>New York City of a possible earthquake.</i>

06:33.349 --> 06:37.103
<i>Some are saying a tsunami. Hang on.</i>
<i>We're receiving word now.</i>

06:37.359 --> 06:41.022
<i>The SHIELD helicarrier has just crashed</i>
<i>into the bay outside the city.</i>

06:41.248 --> 06:44.481
<i>And eyewitnesses are reporting</i>

06:56.511 --> 06:58.049
Chicken soup.

06:59.285 --> 07:00.913
Take care of him.

07:04.162 --> 07:05.322
Huh.

07:05.571 --> 07:06.920
You could help.

07:08.820 --> 07:10.448
What do you want?

07:10.629 --> 07:12.317
You could make a difference.

07:12.936 --> 07:14.338
You could save Thor

07:14.368 --> 07:17.134
just like you saved
Sampson in the Cube.

07:17.361 --> 07:18.461
Funny.

07:18.650 --> 07:21.469
I don't remember Thor
ever coming to save me.

07:22.984 --> 07:25.215
If you help, it will help us.

07:25.501 --> 07:28.426
If you stand by other heroes,
if you save lives,

07:28.682 --> 07:31.259
people will begin to see
that the Hulk isn't a monster.

07:31.289 --> 07:33.513
That you can be
a force for good.

07:34.538 --> 07:37.727
If I do this, then you
do something for me.

07:38.092 --> 07:39.569
- What?
- I stay.

07:39.599 --> 07:42.569
I stay the Hulk, not Banner.

07:49.155 --> 07:51.190
I can't just stand here
and watch this.

07:51.830 --> 07:53.006
We have to do something.

07:53.036 --> 07:55.056
If Thor can't stop him,
he'll come into the city.

07:55.086 --> 07:57.016
Don't you think
I know that, Wasp?

07:57.046 --> 07:59.880
- Jan.
- We're talking millions of people.

07:59.910 --> 08:03.197
- I'm not going to let that happen.
- Jan. Jan, wait.

08:08.391 --> 08:12.175
Can your brutish mind understand
what I'm telling you?

08:12.793 --> 08:16.863
I control one of the four
fundamental forces of reality.

08:17.361 --> 08:22.192
I can remove gravity's effect on you
sending you hurtling into space.

08:22.702 --> 08:27.134
Or I can increase it
a thousandfold like this!

08:45.066 --> 08:46.588
Fury!

08:48.277 --> 08:51.865
[Wasp] Franklin Hall, you give
theoretical physicists a bad name.

08:51.895 --> 08:54.684
Now knock it off
before I make you.

08:54.714 --> 08:56.711
[laughs]
Are you joking?

08:57.114 --> 08:59.571
With the power at my disposal...

09:01.086 --> 09:02.638
Ow! Ow!

09:02.910 --> 09:04.221
Ow! Aah!

09:06.098 --> 09:08.585
Jarvis, give me full satellite
coverage on the scene.

09:10.364 --> 09:11.495
Janet?

09:18.506 --> 09:19.939
Ready to give up?

09:40.598 --> 09:43.870
Hey, Janet. I knew we traveled in
some of the same social circles,

09:43.900 --> 09:47.171
but I didn't know you came to parties
like this. So who was that guy?

09:47.201 --> 09:50.284
Some crazy physicist.
Something to do with Nick Fury.

09:50.702 --> 09:53.008
Tony, am I glad to see you.

09:53.672 --> 09:56.182
I wasn't sure if you were
on the west coast or... Oh, no.

09:56.212 --> 09:57.704
- Thor!
- What?

09:57.897 --> 10:00.867
Thor. You know, with the hammer.
He's on the bottom of the ocean.

10:00.897 --> 10:02.178
We have to help him.

10:05.276 --> 10:08.065
<i>Warning... gravitational field</i>
<i>around the target is in flux.</i>

10:08.095 --> 10:09.784
<i>Extreme caution advised.</i>

10:10.447 --> 10:13.416
Jan, the energy he's putting out...
the only comparison is a black hole.

10:13.446 --> 10:15.459
- This guy is trouble.
- You're right.

10:17.237 --> 10:18.533
Aah!

10:22.483 --> 10:24.232
What are
Graviton's upper limits?

10:24.262 --> 10:27.820
We've studied him for years, and as far
as we could tell, he doesn't have any.

10:27.850 --> 10:30.488
What do you think you're going
to do, Pym? Talk him down?

10:30.518 --> 10:32.802
No, it's too late for that.

10:44.662 --> 10:46.094
Hank, you went big.

10:46.124 --> 10:48.521
Janet, get out of here.
I'll handle Graviton.

10:48.551 --> 10:51.295
What? No, we're
in this together.

11:06.946 --> 11:08.287
This is between us, Hall.

11:08.317 --> 11:11.016
Do whatever you want with me,
but no one else has to get hurt.

11:11.046 --> 11:14.121
No, you wanted me
to create a supersoldier,

11:14.317 --> 11:16.496
but I've become so much more.

11:16.526 --> 11:18.335
I'm beyond human now.

11:18.802 --> 11:22.970
I'm going to crush you and show
the world their new master's power.

11:23.302 --> 11:26.528
Destroying the city
will be a good demonstration.

11:26.558 --> 11:28.443
Goodbye, Nick Fury.

11:28.872 --> 11:30.379
Ha.

11:41.560 --> 11:42.856
Fury.

11:43.444 --> 11:44.816
Aah!

11:45.811 --> 11:47.891
That could've gone better.

11:55.920 --> 12:01.090
[screaming]

13:35.523 --> 13:36.759
I need more power.

13:38.613 --> 13:41.357
<i>Note... Gravitational effect</i>
<i>has ceased.</i>

13:57.577 --> 14:01.496
I recommend you
stay down, mortal.

14:04.918 --> 14:06.908
You think you can stop me.

14:07.375 --> 14:09.034
I've beaten you before.

14:09.290 --> 14:10.783
I can do it again.

14:12.954 --> 14:14.250
Aah!

14:21.951 --> 14:23.700
You really should
listen to the man.

14:28.516 --> 14:31.109
You're sick, Franklin.
You need help.

14:32.729 --> 14:34.478
Or possibly more zapping.

14:35.684 --> 14:37.583
No, no,

14:37.764 --> 14:39.625
the power I wield, I...

14:39.655 --> 14:42.173
You are nothing compared to me.

14:46.040 --> 14:47.864
I'm stronger than all of you.

14:48.256 --> 14:50.382
I'm the strongest one there is.

14:52.515 --> 14:54.739
You sure about that?

Aah!

15:16.698 --> 15:19.804
I did not realize
there were ogres on Midgaard.

15:19.834 --> 15:23.761
[growls]

15:30.853 --> 15:32.451
Is that the Hulk?

15:32.481 --> 15:35.511
Isn't he supposed to be,
you know, the bad guy?

15:36.936 --> 15:38.338
[growls]

15:38.684 --> 15:39.770
No!

15:43.525 --> 15:44.731
Take him down.

15:45.786 --> 15:47.233
Hee-ya!

15:48.183 --> 15:49.359
Ha.

15:53.486 --> 15:55.008
[groans]

15:56.365 --> 15:58.973
Look at you fools.

15:59.275 --> 16:02.908
I possess the power
of the universe itself.

16:03.126 --> 16:05.568
I am power!

16:10.550 --> 16:12.661
Can't move. Can you?

16:13.219 --> 16:15.194
Nay. The others.

Nothing is that powerful.

17:20.896 --> 17:23.790
I control gravity itself.

Aah!

17:53.997 --> 17:55.219
[groans]

18:09.505 --> 18:12.098
This isn't possible.

18:33.479 --> 18:36.871
[growls]

18:37.528 --> 18:38.719
Huh?

18:42.412 --> 18:44.274
You're helping me?

18:44.304 --> 18:45.917
Yeah. Now hit him.

19:10.284 --> 19:11.460
Ow!

19:45.757 --> 19:48.471
For Migaard!

19:54.305 --> 19:56.747
Aah!

20:09.893 --> 20:11.687
Who's strongest now?

20:11.989 --> 20:13.632
You had the power
to do anything,

20:14.944 --> 20:17.657
and you used it to put
millions of lives at risk.

20:18.215 --> 20:19.406
Pretty sad.

20:20.408 --> 20:21.659
Ow.

20:26.721 --> 20:28.560
Come. Let us celebrate.

20:28.862 --> 20:30.007
[Hulkbuster]
Freeze.

20:31.394 --> 20:34.997
Step away from the Hulk.
He's a fugitive from the Cube.

[growls]

20:36.723 --> 20:38.667
You want the Hulk,
you go through me.

20:38.930 --> 20:41.343
The Hulk saved us all.
He's a hero.

20:41.373 --> 20:42.910
As sure as any of us.

20:45.752 --> 20:46.822
Stand down.

20:46.852 --> 20:48.676
We've got bigger problems
than the Hulk.

20:48.706 --> 20:52.294
74 supervillains are now on
the loose all across the country.

20:52.324 --> 20:53.892
Maybe the world by now.

20:54.344 --> 20:55.912
How did this happen, Fury?

20:56.244 --> 20:58.889
I don't know, but we can
find out together.

20:58.919 --> 21:03.021
Come work for me. As SHIELD agent,
you can make a real difference.

21:03.051 --> 21:05.681
No, this is your fault,
isn't it?

21:06.043 --> 21:07.852
SHIELD created Graviton.

21:07.882 --> 21:10.384
Whatever you had Hall doing,
it changed him.

21:10.867 --> 21:13.203
You kept it under wraps,
and this happened.

21:17.302 --> 21:18.946
- Fury's right.
- What?

21:19.172 --> 21:21.674
You of all people are
going to work for SHIELD?

21:21.915 --> 21:24.598
No, he's right about us
making a difference together.

21:24.825 --> 21:28.126
One-on-one we can each take
down a villain or two, but 74...

21:28.156 --> 21:29.460
None of us can do it alone.

21:29.777 --> 21:31.525
Together we have a chance.

21:31.555 --> 21:33.681
What we did here,
it can change things.

21:33.877 --> 21:36.462
The world needs us,
but not as SHIELD agents.

21:36.628 --> 21:38.106
As a team on our own.

21:38.136 --> 21:41.520
Together we can avenge the wrongs
caused by all these villains.

21:41.550 --> 21:42.801
We can be avengers.

21:43.223 --> 21:45.108
Huh, good name.

21:45.431 --> 21:48.250
Director Fury, we have
the security footage online.

21:48.468 --> 21:52.222
Graviton didn't wake until after
the supervillain prison shut down.

21:52.817 --> 21:54.370
He couldn't have
been responsible.

21:55.342 --> 21:58.236
And if he wasn't, who was?
