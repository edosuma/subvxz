00:52.249 --> 00:53.769
Give me that.

01:48.208 --> 01:49.529
Good morning, Rachel.
How are you?

01:49.648 --> 01:51.009
You know me, I'm not a complainer.

01:51.248 --> 01:52.288
Goes without saying.

01:52.528 --> 01:54.049
But my old bursitis
has been acting up.

01:54.168 --> 01:56.368
And I've got that tingling
in my hands again.

01:56.608 --> 01:59.288
Never mind I haven't had
a decent sleep in weeks.

01:59.608 --> 02:01.728
But why go on.
- Indeed.

02:02.048 --> 02:03.464
Your brother not feeling
social again?

02:03.488 --> 02:05.768
No, Matthew has a very special
chore this morning.

02:06.288 --> 02:09.527
All right now, Harry. We got
some important business today.

02:09.768 --> 02:11.528
So I need you on
your best behavior.

02:11.967 --> 02:13.087
There you go, good boy.

02:13.327 --> 02:14.327
Abner!

02:14.567 --> 02:16.567
Abner, you're gonna run...
Come back here!

02:16.847 --> 02:18.423
Abner, I don't have time
to fool with you.

02:18.447 --> 02:20.607
Abner! Come here!

02:22.127 --> 02:23.127
Come here!

02:23.407 --> 02:25.407
Abner, I'm not in the mood.

02:26.647 --> 02:29.647
Hey, you little runner!
Get back here. Abner!

02:30.047 --> 02:31.327
Get outta there!

02:31.727 --> 02:32.767
Abner!

02:44.287 --> 02:46.087
Lord, give me strength.

02:46.807 --> 02:48.927
Matthew! You're supposed to be
at the station.

02:49.167 --> 02:50.887
I know! I had an accident.

02:51.127 --> 02:52.463
What's happened?
Are you all right?

02:52.487 --> 02:54.087
I'm happy as a pet crow.

02:54.327 --> 02:57.847
You see, that is exactly why
we're doing what we're doing.

02:58.087 --> 03:00.126
Lord. You're supposed to be
there already.

03:00.366 --> 03:02.286
Please, stop fustling. I'm...

03:02.526 --> 03:04.382
From now on, things are gonna be
different around here.

03:04.406 --> 03:07.446
Go on, change all your clothes.
It's disgusting.

03:19.166 --> 03:20.686
Hello, Rachel!

03:21.086 --> 03:23.726
I doozy up pretty good,
don't you think?

03:36.246 --> 03:38.646
- An orphan? You can't be serious.
- We are.

03:38.886 --> 03:40.407
What in heaven's name
are you thinking?

03:40.446 --> 03:42.126
Matthew needs some help
with chores.

03:42.366 --> 03:44.302
Dorothy Spencer said
she was going down to Hopetown...

03:44.326 --> 03:46.741
...to get herself a girl. We asked
her to bring us back a boy.

03:46.765 --> 03:48.965
But an orphan, really?
Are you sure?

03:49.165 --> 03:50.981
We aim to give him a good home.
Good education.

03:51.005 --> 03:53.566
But you don't know anything about
him. He might be a gypsy child.

03:53.645 --> 03:54.765
Or worse.
- Rachel!

03:55.045 --> 03:57.045
Just last week I read in the paper
about a boy...

03:57.285 --> 03:59.541
...who set fire to the house.
Nearly burnt the poor couple...

03:59.565 --> 04:00.645
...to a crisp.
- Rachel!

04:00.885 --> 04:03.685
And there was another one. A girl.
She took a rifle...

04:03.925 --> 04:06.525
...and shot the whole family.
Then she slit their throats...

04:06.805 --> 04:08.445
...with a bread knife.
Even the baby.

04:08.925 --> 04:11.485
I were you I'd keep
my bedroom door locked.

04:11.725 --> 04:13.725
And a knife under my pillow.

04:15.765 --> 04:17.885
We're not getting a girl.

04:19.285 --> 04:20.524
We're getting a boy.

04:23.325 --> 04:24.485
Hello?

04:27.365 --> 04:29.365
Edwin. The twelve-thirty
come through?

04:29.805 --> 04:31.045
Right on time, Matthew.

04:31.285 --> 04:33.364
Exactly one hour
and four minutes ago.

04:33.604 --> 04:36.644
Well, I... Never mind.
We're excepting a youngster.

04:37.324 --> 04:38.724
Came in with Mrs. Spencer.

04:41.764 --> 04:42.924
Where about?

04:43.101 --> 04:44.221
Outside.

04:55.524 --> 04:56.564
Hello?

04:58.564 --> 05:01.444
That's a girl outside. A girl.
- Most girls are.

05:01.684 --> 05:03.644
We're expecting a boy.
Where is he?

05:03.902 --> 05:06.622
- Must've been a mix-up.
- We asked for a boy.

05:06.991 --> 05:09.471
- Maybe they're fresh out.
- Edmond, please.

05:10.284 --> 05:12.604
Are you Mr. Matthew Cuthbert of
Green Gables?

05:15.444 --> 05:16.764
Yes, I am.

05:17.184 --> 05:19.623
How do you do?
My name is Anne Shirley.

05:20.019 --> 05:21.539
And this is for you.

05:24.523 --> 05:26.800
I was beginning to fear something
terrible had happened.

05:26.866 --> 05:28.826
So I made up my mind if you didn't
come for me...

05:28.941 --> 05:31.262
...I'd climb up into some tree
and stay up there all night.

05:32.083 --> 05:34.203
It would be lovely to sleep
in a tree.

05:34.341 --> 05:36.821
Wild, crooked, white with bloom.

05:37.243 --> 05:40.003
Can you imagine in the moonlight
how it would look?

05:40.243 --> 05:41.283
Well...

05:42.763 --> 05:44.163
Did you come in a wagon?

05:45.203 --> 05:46.723
Yes, I do.

05:47.923 --> 05:49.603
No, that's all right.

05:51.163 --> 05:53.684
It's not heavy. Besides, if it
isn't carried in a certain way...

05:53.803 --> 05:54.923
...the handle pulls out.

05:55.163 --> 05:57.803
So I'd better hang onto it because
I know the exact knack of it.

06:02.083 --> 06:03.563
Best to Marilla.

06:08.882 --> 06:11.282
This island is even more
wondrous than I imagined.

06:11.522 --> 06:13.402
And I can tell you
that's saying quite a lot.

06:14.322 --> 06:16.362
Are there trees
around Green Gables?

06:17.042 --> 06:20.562
I adore trees. There were
some at the orphanage...

06:20.802 --> 06:22.042
...but they were scrawny.

06:22.282 --> 06:24.402
By any chance,
is there a babbling brook?

06:24.642 --> 06:27.122
Yes. Just a look and a half
from the house.

06:27.362 --> 06:28.402
Really?

06:28.642 --> 06:30.803
It's always been one of
my dreams to live near a brook.

06:30.962 --> 06:32.762
I never expected I would, though.

06:35.202 --> 06:38.042
Mr. Cuthbert, why is the earth red?

06:38.882 --> 06:41.602
Well now, that's a fair question.

06:41.842 --> 06:46.042
I don't...
I don't exactly know why.

06:47.322 --> 06:50.442
Well now, that's something else
to find out about one day.

06:53.281 --> 06:55.241
Look, do you see
that colorful bird?

06:56.001 --> 06:57.041
Where?

06:57.481 --> 06:58.681
You see, up there!

07:03.281 --> 07:04.761
Mr. Cuthbert?

07:05.201 --> 07:08.481
Who was Prince Edward? Was he
a real prince or make-believe?

07:09.801 --> 07:11.081
Prince Edward...

07:12.081 --> 07:13.681
No matter, it's all the same to me.

07:13.921 --> 07:15.641
And something else
to find out about.

07:15.881 --> 07:18.281
Isn't it just splendid to think
of all the things...

07:18.521 --> 07:19.762
...there are to find out about?

07:20.081 --> 07:21.522
It wouldn't be half
so interesting...

07:21.721 --> 07:24.001
...if we knew everything
about everything, would it?

07:25.321 --> 07:26.841
No, I suppose not

08:06.160 --> 08:07.640
What is that sound?

08:08.640 --> 08:09.880
Spring peepers.

08:11.120 --> 08:14.680
They are little tiny frogs.
Right down there in Barry's Pond.

08:14.920 --> 08:16.160
Barry's Pond?

08:16.840 --> 08:18.520
No, that's much too plain.

08:18.760 --> 08:21.880
It should be something
glorious and romantic like...

08:23.120 --> 08:24.320
I know!

08:24.880 --> 08:26.919
Lake of Shining Waters.

08:27.879 --> 08:29.599
Shining Waters, huh?

08:31.599 --> 08:34.318
Our brook flows
right the way down into it.

08:36.599 --> 08:39.599
I'm sorry. Sometimes I dream
when I'm wide awake.

08:39.839 --> 08:41.159
Do you ever do that?

08:41.919 --> 08:43.159
Not lately.

08:43.919 --> 08:47.599
I love dreaming, even though I know
they don't always come true.

08:48.159 --> 08:50.279
Right now I'm so near
perfectly happy I can't tell...

08:50.519 --> 08:52.719
...if I'm dreaming or not.
- Well now...

08:52.959 --> 08:55.799
Listen, Miss Anne. You know,
my sister Marilla...

08:56.039 --> 08:57.760
But what's so terrible is
I can't ever be...

08:57.919 --> 08:59.839
...perfectly happy because...

09:01.999 --> 09:03.559
What color would you
call this hair?

09:03.799 --> 09:05.399
Well, I would say it's red.

09:05.799 --> 09:07.879
But there are other colors
in there too.

09:08.479 --> 09:09.759
Exactly.

09:10.279 --> 09:11.680
Nobody who has hair
this horrible...

09:11.759 --> 09:13.399
...could possibly ever be
perfectly happy.

09:14.078 --> 09:16.118
It will be my lifelong sorrow.

09:17.838 --> 09:19.318
Am I talking too much?

09:19.998 --> 09:22.198
People always tell me I do.
And I know I embellish...

09:22.478 --> 09:24.118
...and I know
that's not proper but...

09:25.158 --> 09:27.638
There I go again.
Would you rather I didn't speak?

09:28.118 --> 09:29.718
Guess I don't mind.

09:33.838 --> 09:37.198
Just that the bottom of this hill,
just past the trees...

09:37.678 --> 09:39.318
...you can see Green Gables.

10:03.877 --> 10:06.237
It's exactly as I imagined it.

10:20.197 --> 10:22.677
Thank heavens. I thought you
must have crashed in a ditch...

10:25.037 --> 10:27.237
No.

10:27.477 --> 10:29.077
What's the meaning of this?

10:29.997 --> 10:31.717
- Now, Marilla...
- That's not a boy.

10:32.277 --> 10:33.437
You're not a boy.

10:33.677 --> 10:35.357
If you'll just let me explain...

10:35.597 --> 10:37.798
I told Mrs. Spencer to bring us
a boy. I was very clear.

10:37.877 --> 10:39.757
I said bring us a boy about
eleven years old.

10:39.997 --> 10:41.917
Well, I guess they just
didn't have one.

10:43.117 --> 10:45.477
Some pretty piece of
business this is.

10:45.957 --> 10:47.596
What are we supposed to do
with her?

10:49.116 --> 10:51.996
I couldn't just leave her all alone
at the station.

11:00.676 --> 11:02.756
You don't want me
because I'm not a boy?

11:05.156 --> 11:07.317
I might have known it was all
too beautiful to be true.

11:07.556 --> 11:09.956
Calm now, child. There's no reason
to cry so about it.

11:10.196 --> 11:12.676
Yes, there is a need.
This is the most tragic thing...

11:12.916 --> 11:14.556
...that ever happened to me.

11:15.476 --> 11:19.516
God, child. We're not going to turn
you out of doors tonight. Here.

11:24.516 --> 11:25.916
What's your name?

11:28.636 --> 11:31.596
If you please, would you call me
Cordelia?

11:31.996 --> 11:33.875
It's such a perfectly
elegant name.

11:36.355 --> 11:37.915
Your name is Cordelia?

11:41.115 --> 11:42.755
Not exactly.

11:46.395 --> 11:48.435
What is it? Tell me the truth.

11:48.955 --> 11:50.275
Anne Shirley.

11:50.755 --> 11:52.995
You see what I mean?
Two first names put together?

11:53.235 --> 11:55.491
It stands out something awful
and if I'm starting all over...

11:55.515 --> 11:56.851
...Cordelia would be my preference.

11:56.875 --> 11:59.915
Fiddlesticks to all that. Anne is
a real good plain and simple name.

12:00.155 --> 12:01.596
You've no reason to be
ashamed of it.

12:01.715 --> 12:04.475
I'm not ashamed of it. Only I like
Cordelia so much better.

12:05.155 --> 12:06.571
But if you must call me Anne,
would you call me...

12:06.595 --> 12:08.995
...the kind of Anne that's spelled
with an "e" at the end.

12:12.035 --> 12:13.355
Give me that.

12:24.434 --> 12:25.554
Lilacs.

12:35.634 --> 12:37.354
Ambrosia.

12:39.354 --> 12:40.994
What a pretty path.

12:41.234 --> 12:42.914
We call that The Avenue.

12:44.354 --> 12:45.594
Avenue?

12:46.314 --> 12:49.314
That name doesn't do it justice.
I know.

12:50.474 --> 12:54.354
I'm going to call it
The White Way of Delight.

12:57.314 --> 12:59.634
A magical place like this always
gives me a q... r...

12:59.874 --> 13:02.114
...funny sort of ache. In here.

13:03.554 --> 13:05.370
Did you ever have an ache
like that, Miss Cuthbert?

13:05.394 --> 13:07.113
Not that I recall. Come along.

13:07.353 --> 13:09.073
We'll sort all this out
in the morning.

13:20.353 --> 13:23.673
Come along. This way.
Keep going.

13:24.473 --> 13:25.873
Right upstairs.

13:32.793 --> 13:34.793
Now, Harry, what do you think,
old friend?

13:38.473 --> 13:41.233
Yeah. No, she is not a boy.
And she is a talker but...

13:41.753 --> 13:43.433
...she is really interesting.

13:44.233 --> 13:45.753
Gotta we met that, huh?

13:47.313 --> 13:50.713
Abner, you're the cause of
all my troubles today.

13:50.953 --> 13:52.593
What've you got to say
for yourself?

13:55.272 --> 13:56.872
I'll accept your apology.

13:57.752 --> 13:59.712
Alright, Harry, let's get
you ready for bed.

14:10.432 --> 14:12.432
Come now, child.
You haven't eaten a thing.

14:13.472 --> 14:16.512
Can you eat when you're
in the depths of despair?

14:16.752 --> 14:19.232
I've never been in the depths of
despair so I wouldn't know.

14:21.152 --> 14:25.272
Haven't you ever try to imagine
you were in the depths of despair?

14:25.792 --> 14:28.032
Why on earth would I wanna
do thing like that?

14:28.672 --> 14:31.472
I can assure you,
it's a very unpleasant feeling.

14:32.032 --> 14:34.752
When you try to eat, a lump
comes right up in your throat...

14:34.952 --> 14:36.952
...and you can't swallow
anything.

14:37.712 --> 14:41.431
Not even if it was
a chocolate caramel.

14:44.351 --> 14:45.831
She must be tired.

14:46.391 --> 14:48.191
I suppose, it could be
all the travel.

15:08.431 --> 15:10.231
Quick-quick. Into bed.

15:12.351 --> 15:14.071
I need to blow out the oil lamp.

15:14.711 --> 15:16.871
That's all right, I can
blow out my own lamp.

15:17.511 --> 15:18.911
That'll be the day.

15:24.311 --> 15:25.551
Marilla...

15:26.711 --> 15:29.270
Do I truly have to leave
tomorrow?

15:30.070 --> 15:31.790
I'll sort that out in the morning.

15:33.710 --> 15:35.030
Good night, then.

15:52.190 --> 15:54.910
This is what comes of sending word
instead of going ourselves.

15:55.150 --> 15:57.550
Can you imagine how my message
could have gotten so twisted?

15:58.070 --> 16:00.270
In any case, she has to
go back to the orphanage.

16:02.590 --> 16:04.430
What is "hmmm" mean?
You don't agree?

16:04.670 --> 16:06.710
She seems like a real sweet child.

16:07.110 --> 16:09.870
Pity to send her back
when she's so set on staying.

16:10.790 --> 16:13.430
- You're not thinking...
- No, I suppose not.

16:13.750 --> 16:17.269
We don't need an orphan girl.
If I did, I'm not sure she is...

16:17.509 --> 16:19.550
...the one I'd pick out.
And there's something else.

16:19.789 --> 16:20.869
What's that?

16:22.149 --> 16:24.269
There's something about her
I don't understand.

16:25.669 --> 16:26.909
No, she's to go back.

16:27.149 --> 16:29.485
I'll go into town first thing
in the morning and take care of it.

16:29.509 --> 16:31.869
- Wait till after chores.
- What on earth for?

16:32.869 --> 16:35.589
There's a chance to spend some time
with her, get to know her.

16:36.069 --> 16:37.669
What good would that do?

16:38.909 --> 16:40.349
For you, not much.

16:40.869 --> 16:43.269
For the child, though
it could mean something.

16:45.349 --> 16:48.509
Just like you to get a whim
and cling on to it.

16:48.749 --> 16:50.389
You're not better than
an overgrown boy.

16:50.629 --> 16:52.989
All right, I'm off to bed now.
Good night.

17:54.347 --> 17:55.867
Give me that.

18:55.386 --> 18:56.986
I'm sure hungry this morning.

18:59.106 --> 19:01.946
The world doesn't seem
such a howling wilderness...

19:02.186 --> 19:03.746
...as it did last night.

19:06.426 --> 19:07.946
It's always better...

19:08.986 --> 19:10.907
...to be cheerful and bear up
under affliction...

19:11.146 --> 19:12.146
...on a sunshiny day.

19:12.386 --> 19:14.666
For pity's sake,
will you stop talking?

19:14.906 --> 19:16.946
You talk quite a lot
for a little girl.

19:18.786 --> 19:21.345
- I'll be quiet now.
- That's a relief.

19:24.105 --> 19:25.185
Marilla?

19:27.665 --> 19:28.985
Good morning Miss Anne.

19:29.585 --> 19:30.905
Hello Matthew.

19:33.545 --> 19:35.385
Should I hitch up Harry?

19:38.145 --> 19:39.785
I'll go this afternoon.

19:45.905 --> 19:48.625
Now, young lady, I expect to
help me with the chores...

19:48.865 --> 19:50.705
...when you finished with all that.

19:57.505 --> 19:59.105
Lord help us all.

20:00.585 --> 20:02.305
Now, watch your step,
it's slick in here.

20:03.065 --> 20:04.385
You familiar with animals?

20:04.625 --> 20:07.625
No, not at all but I've made up
my mind to enjoy this experience.

20:07.865 --> 20:10.000
I believe it will make me a better
and more rounded person.

20:10.024 --> 20:11.064
I see.

20:11.344 --> 20:12.920
I believe you can enjoy
nearly anything...

20:12.944 --> 20:14.160
...if you make up your mind to.

20:14.184 --> 20:16.464
Look, that little pig is so pink.

20:16.704 --> 20:19.184
Imagine being born bright pink.

20:19.424 --> 20:21.744
It's the most bewitching color.
But I can't wear it.

20:21.984 --> 20:25.304
Redheads can't wear pink.
Another hope dashed to the ground.

20:25.544 --> 20:28.704
My life is a perfect graveyard of
buried hopes.

20:31.864 --> 20:33.344
All right, come over here.

20:34.624 --> 20:36.104
Sit down on the stool, come on.

20:37.024 --> 20:38.024
It's alright.

20:38.984 --> 20:40.024
There you go.

20:40.584 --> 20:41.904
There you got the pail.

20:42.944 --> 20:45.824
Okay. All right.

20:47.304 --> 20:48.584
What's that called?

20:48.824 --> 20:51.304
This is called an udder.
And these are the teats.

20:51.504 --> 20:54.784
What you do is squeeze and pull.

20:55.023 --> 20:56.023
Okay, you try it.

20:57.063 --> 20:58.543
Come on, they don't bite.

20:59.623 --> 21:01.023
Just...

21:02.383 --> 21:03.823
There you go.

21:04.463 --> 21:06.063
I imagine you grew up in a city.

21:06.303 --> 21:09.023
Yeah. Bolingbroke, Nova Scotia.

21:10.703 --> 21:12.383
You happen to know your parents?

21:13.023 --> 21:16.423
Yes, Walter und Bertha.
Aren't they lovely names?

21:16.983 --> 21:19.143
I'm so glad they had
such nice names.

21:19.383 --> 21:20.919
It would be a shame
to have a father named...

21:20.943 --> 21:22.439
...something like Jedediah,
wouldn't it?

21:22.463 --> 21:25.423
Nonsense. A name isn't important,
it's how a person behaves.

21:25.903 --> 21:29.423
I read in a book once, a rose by
any other name smells as sweet.

21:29.823 --> 21:31.903
But I can't believe it.
What do you think?

21:32.103 --> 21:34.103
Haven't given that
a lot of thought.

21:34.703 --> 21:36.503
There you go, you're getting
the knack of it.

21:37.023 --> 21:38.503
Do you mind me asking you...

21:39.023 --> 21:40.743
...what happened to
Walter and Bertha?

21:40.983 --> 21:42.902
Both died of fever
when I was five years old.

21:43.142 --> 21:45.463
Town folks were at their wits end
about what to do with me.

21:45.702 --> 21:48.422
So Mrs. Thomas down the road
took me.

21:48.662 --> 21:52.782
Though she was poor and
had an emotional husband.

21:58.902 --> 22:00.742
But when he wasn't unhappy
about things...

22:00.942 --> 22:02.662
...he was very clever
with checkers.

22:03.142 --> 22:05.062
They had four children
younger than me.

22:05.302 --> 22:07.702
That was my job.
Looking after the children.

22:07.902 --> 22:11.022
Go ahead. Just go in. Don't step on
anyone. Go on through.

22:11.582 --> 22:12.902
There you go.

22:14.862 --> 22:16.022
There you go.

22:18.182 --> 22:19.302
All right.

22:22.382 --> 22:23.782
There's stuff on them!

22:24.022 --> 22:25.262
It's only stuff!

22:27.262 --> 22:30.541
And then Mr. Thomas died falling
under a train...

22:30.981 --> 22:33.061
...and I ended up
in my first orphan home.

22:38.501 --> 22:39.781
And then what happened?

22:40.461 --> 22:44.261
Then Mrs. Hammond from up
the river came and...

22:44.781 --> 22:48.621
...said she'd take me, seeing I
was handy with children.

22:50.021 --> 22:52.821
Mrs. Hammond had twins three times.

22:53.661 --> 22:57.621
I like babies in moderation, but
twins three times in succession.

22:57.981 --> 22:59.781
In my opinion,
that's over the limit.

23:00.701 --> 23:02.181
And what happened to Mr. Hammond?

23:02.421 --> 23:05.621
Mr. Hammond died and Mrs. Hammond
couldn't cope with life anymore...

23:06.021 --> 23:08.901
...so I ended up at the orphanage
at Hopetown.

23:10.061 --> 23:12.141
The one with Mrs. Carlyle.

23:14.581 --> 23:17.780
You'll obey my rules or be sent
to the work house.

23:19.100 --> 23:20.420
But, Anne, these women...

23:20.660 --> 23:24.380
...Mrs. Hammond, Mrs. Carlyle,
Mrs. Thomas...

23:24.620 --> 23:26.500
...they were good to you, right?

23:26.700 --> 23:28.861
I'm sure they meant to be.
I'm sure they meant to be...

23:29.060 --> 23:31.260
...just as kind and good
as they possibly...

23:31.500 --> 23:33.020
Look at those sea gulls!

23:33.860 --> 23:35.980
Wouldn't you just love to be
up there?

23:36.220 --> 23:39.180
Swooping over land
and ocean all day long?

23:41.700 --> 23:42.820
Do you see?

24:01.740 --> 24:03.139
My brother and I wanted a boy...

24:03.379 --> 24:05.060
...to help with the chores
around the farm.

24:05.259 --> 24:07.260
So you can appreciate
that when a girl showed up...

24:07.419 --> 24:08.955
Anyway, we thought that
Social Services...

24:08.979 --> 24:11.075
...might be able to find a home
for her. A good family.

24:11.099 --> 24:12.260
One that will be kind to her.

24:12.459 --> 24:14.620
Miss Cuthbert, these days there
simply aren't enough...

24:14.659 --> 24:16.259
...good families to go around.

24:16.459 --> 24:18.675
If you hand her over to us,
we'll either have to send her...

24:18.699 --> 24:21.419
...back to the orphanage or to
the workhouse in Charlottetown.

24:21.659 --> 24:24.379
But tell me you at least be able
to find a proper family for her.

24:26.299 --> 24:28.379
Perhaps if you contact
Gladys Haines.

24:28.619 --> 24:31.259
She's head of Presbyterian
Orphan Homes in Charlottetown.

24:31.739 --> 24:34.179
I'm sorry, I have a desk
piled with cases.

24:34.419 --> 24:36.899
Good day, Miss Cuthbert.
- I...

24:39.139 --> 24:40.499
A lively young girl like you...

24:40.699 --> 24:43.499
...should be living with a proper
family, and going to school.

24:44.059 --> 24:46.459
So I have asked
Children's Services...

24:46.699 --> 24:48.220
...to look out for a good home
for you.

24:48.459 --> 24:51.978
One that has children your own age.
But in the meantime...

24:52.778 --> 24:54.298
I can stay?

24:54.898 --> 24:56.658
Well, yes, but it's only temporary.

24:57.138 --> 25:00.098
Miss Cuthbert, I promise to be
the best orphan...

25:00.338 --> 25:01.698
...you could ever hope for.

25:01.938 --> 25:04.698
Boy or girl.
I'll help with the chores...

25:05.138 --> 25:06.979
...and I'll try my best not to talk
too much...

25:07.138 --> 25:09.034
...and I'll try my absolute
hardest not to allow...

25:09.058 --> 25:12.658
...my imagination run away.
What should I call you? I know.

25:12.858 --> 25:14.618
What about Aunt Marilla?

25:14.858 --> 25:16.659
It would make me feel
as if I really belonged.

25:16.898 --> 25:18.418
No, I'm not your aunt.

25:18.658 --> 25:19.658
And I don't believe in...

25:19.858 --> 25:21.634
...calling people names
that don't belong to them.

25:21.658 --> 25:23.738
But you could imagine
you're my aunt.

25:24.418 --> 25:25.498
No, I couldn't.

25:26.418 --> 25:28.859
Don't you ever imagine things
different from the way they are?

25:29.418 --> 25:32.298
No, never.
And Marilla will do just fine.

25:34.138 --> 25:35.338
Marilla.

25:36.737 --> 25:37.897
What does it mean?

25:38.937 --> 25:40.977
I believe it's short for Amaryllis.

25:41.417 --> 25:43.257
That is such a beautiful name.

25:43.777 --> 25:46.617
Your mother and father must have
loved you very much.

25:55.257 --> 25:56.457
Good day, Muriel.

25:59.697 --> 26:00.897
How can I help you, Marilla?

26:01.137 --> 26:02.297
Just postage stamp.

26:03.657 --> 26:05.337
Presbyterian Orphan Homes.

26:05.577 --> 26:06.978
Must be about
your Anne girl, is it?

26:07.217 --> 26:09.257
Be sure you seal it up
after you've read it.

26:17.737 --> 26:18.777
Dear Mrs. Haines...

26:19.017 --> 26:20.818
...I'm writing to day,
Anne Shirley who was...

26:20.857 --> 26:22.697
...mistakenly delivered to
our home in Avonlea.

26:22.776 --> 26:24.377
Find it quite impossible
to care for her.

26:24.456 --> 26:26.657
Mrs. Beatty suggested,
you may find a suitable family...

26:26.896 --> 26:28.296
...for this child.

26:35.016 --> 26:37.056
Here now, let me take that.

26:40.856 --> 26:42.176
All right.

26:42.536 --> 26:43.536
Well done!

26:43.776 --> 26:44.936
Matthew...

26:46.136 --> 26:48.216
...may I please go
see the babbling brook.

26:48.416 --> 26:51.336
Just a peek. I would so,
so dearly love to see...

26:51.576 --> 26:52.816
...a real babbling brook.

26:54.896 --> 26:56.456
You promise to be careful?

26:56.696 --> 26:59.256
Don't worry. I'm an extremely
responsible child.

27:00.416 --> 27:02.816
Take the path behind the barn,
down the hill.

27:05.736 --> 27:07.616
You come back
if it starts raining!

27:50.975 --> 27:52.751
Why on earth didn't you leave her
with Mrs. Beatty?

27:52.775 --> 27:54.416
I couldn't send her back to the
orphanage.

27:54.455 --> 27:56.175
It's a girl had enough
hardship in her life.

27:56.414 --> 27:57.670
Then you should have taken her to
Mrs. Spencer.

27:57.694 --> 27:59.134
After all it was her mistake.

27:59.774 --> 28:01.494
It's only for a short time.

28:01.734 --> 28:04.774
It's only until Matthew takes her
into the town. We'll figure out.

28:05.014 --> 28:07.655
Marilla, I picked these down by the
brook. May I put them in water?

28:08.414 --> 28:10.894
Anne, this my neighbor
and my good friend, Mrs. Lynde.

28:11.694 --> 28:12.734
How do you do?

28:12.974 --> 28:15.454
Well, she's not much to look at.
Scrawny.

28:15.934 --> 28:17.294
Raspberry jam hair.

28:17.534 --> 28:19.494
My word, would you
look at those freckles.

28:22.814 --> 28:24.974
My dear, what an odd look.
What could it mean?

28:26.214 --> 28:27.534
It means I hate you.

28:27.774 --> 28:29.134
I beg your pardon?

28:29.414 --> 28:30.414
Anne!

28:31.294 --> 28:34.214
Anne! Anne, come back in here!

28:34.454 --> 28:35.694
Yes?

28:36.934 --> 28:38.054
What did you say?

28:38.934 --> 28:40.334
I said, I hate you.

28:40.814 --> 28:42.374
Anne Shirley.

28:43.373 --> 28:45.093
How dare you say I'm skinny
and ugly?

28:45.333 --> 28:47.413
How dare you call me I'm freckled
and red-headed.

28:47.613 --> 28:50.933
You are a rude, impolite,
unfeeling woman!

28:51.173 --> 28:53.173
All right, that is quite
enough of that.

28:53.413 --> 28:55.429
How would you like to have
such things said about you?

28:55.453 --> 28:57.654
How would you like to be told
you were fat and clumsy...

28:57.853 --> 28:59.973
...and probably hadn't a
spark of imagination?

29:00.413 --> 29:03.653
You have hurt me worse than
Mrs. Thomas's intoxicated husband!

29:03.893 --> 29:05.893
I shall never forgive you!
Never!

29:06.133 --> 29:08.534
All right, you stop that right now.
You go up to your room...

29:08.773 --> 29:10.853
...and you stay there
until I come and get you.

29:11.333 --> 29:12.413
Go on!

29:14.293 --> 29:15.893
Have you ever seen such a temper?

29:16.133 --> 29:18.334
But you probably shouldn't have
twitted about her looks.

29:18.533 --> 29:19.613
She...

29:19.813 --> 29:20.933
What?

29:22.413 --> 29:23.653
Anne.

29:26.013 --> 29:27.093
Anne.

29:27.573 --> 29:28.653
Sit up.

29:30.572 --> 29:34.212
You should be ashamed of yourself.
Behaving that way to your elders.

29:34.452 --> 29:37.772
Imagine how you would feel
if somebody told you...

29:38.012 --> 29:40.252
...straight to your face
you were nothing to look at!

29:40.892 --> 29:43.253
I didn't say that Rachel Lynde
was right. She can be very...

29:43.572 --> 29:46.372
Anyway, there is no excuse.
You were very rude to her.

29:46.612 --> 29:47.908
You need to tell her
that you're sorry...

29:47.932 --> 29:49.412
...and ask her for forgiveness.

29:49.652 --> 29:51.212
- I won't!
- Anne!

29:51.452 --> 29:54.852
You can punish me any way you like.
Shut me up in a dark...

29:55.092 --> 29:57.692
...damp dungeon inhabited
by snakes and toads!

29:58.132 --> 30:00.052
Or send me back to
that horrible orphanage.

30:00.292 --> 30:02.052
I'm not going to
send you anywhere.

30:05.732 --> 30:07.212
Well, whatever you do...

30:08.292 --> 30:11.252
...I am never going to apologize
to Mrs. Lynde.

30:11.532 --> 30:13.052
Never!

30:14.052 --> 30:15.933
Very well. Then I think
what you should do is...

30:16.012 --> 30:18.531
...just stay right here
until you reconsider.

30:34.451 --> 30:36.211
Anne? I have your breakfast.

30:38.491 --> 30:40.291
It's out here when you want it.

31:39.770 --> 31:41.450
Miss Anne? May I come in?

31:42.810 --> 31:43.850
All right.

31:48.410 --> 31:49.650
How you feeling?

31:49.890 --> 31:51.409
Quite well, thank you.

31:53.689 --> 31:55.009
Not hungry?

31:55.689 --> 31:57.129
Maybe later.

31:57.489 --> 31:58.609
Later then.

32:02.489 --> 32:05.049
Listen, Miss Anne with an "e".

32:05.809 --> 32:07.330
My sister is a very
determined woman...

32:07.529 --> 32:08.930
...and nobody gets the best of her.

32:09.049 --> 32:10.289
So, if I were you...

32:10.529 --> 32:13.649
...I'd smooth over what's between
you. And the sooner the better.

32:15.529 --> 32:18.489
- Apologize?
- Yes. What say you?

32:19.889 --> 32:22.769
I suppose I could do it
to oblige you.

32:25.529 --> 32:28.329
It would be sort of true.

32:28.689 --> 32:30.609
Since I really am sorry.

32:31.929 --> 32:34.209
I wasn't a bit last night.
But this morning...

32:34.449 --> 32:37.088
...I felt so ashamed of
my behavior.

32:37.288 --> 32:39.288
Do you really truly think
I should?

32:39.488 --> 32:43.288
I know is without you it's
terrible lonesome around here.

32:44.328 --> 32:48.888
Now listen. Don't let onto Marilla
that I say anything about this.

32:49.128 --> 32:52.488
I promised to keep my oar
out of the water.

32:52.728 --> 32:54.128
So to speak.

33:28.527 --> 33:30.327
I think I apologized pretty well.

33:30.567 --> 33:33.023
I thought since I had to do it,
I might as well do it thoroughly.

33:33.047 --> 33:35.647
You certainly did it thoroughly.
Next time you might wanna...

33:35.887 --> 33:37.687
...try to control your temper
a little.

33:38.127 --> 33:40.607
That would be easier if people
didn't twit about my hair.

33:40.847 --> 33:43.287
That sort of thing makes me
boil right over.

33:43.527 --> 33:45.567
You shouldn't think so much about
your looks.

33:45.807 --> 33:47.767
I think you might be quite
a vain little girl.

33:48.007 --> 33:49.807
How can I be vain when
I'm feeling homely?

33:50.047 --> 33:52.527
When I look in the glass what I see
doesn't make me feel vain.

33:52.767 --> 33:54.328
It makes me feel sorrowful
and pathetic.

33:54.487 --> 33:55.807
Handsome is as handsome does.

33:56.047 --> 33:58.447
Handsome does is much easier
if you're handsome is.

33:59.927 --> 34:01.407
You might have a point.

34:11.606 --> 34:13.726
Set it down, Anne. I'll hold it in.

34:14.246 --> 34:15.846
It's all right Matthew.

34:17.646 --> 34:19.846
You see, I'm ever so much stronger.

34:46.485 --> 34:48.726
Don't you ever say your prayers
before bed?

34:49.446 --> 34:50.766
I don't know any.

34:51.806 --> 34:53.085
You don't know any?

34:53.326 --> 34:57.805
Prayers. Never learned any.
But I'm good at making stuff up.

34:58.245 --> 34:59.645
How do I start?

35:01.725 --> 35:04.085
Well, you...
First you kneel down.

35:07.925 --> 35:10.085
Not on the bed.
On the floor.

35:10.445 --> 35:11.485
Why?

35:11.885 --> 35:13.565
That's just the way it's done.

35:19.885 --> 35:23.845
Now, you thank God for your
many blessings...

35:24.085 --> 35:28.885
...and then you ask him humbly
for the things that you want.

35:31.525 --> 35:33.445
Gracious Heavenly Father.

35:33.685 --> 35:35.126
That's a good start,
don't you think?

35:35.205 --> 35:36.325
Very good start.

35:36.565 --> 35:37.925
Gracious Heavenly Father...

35:38.165 --> 35:41.125
I thank thee for
the White Way of Delight...

35:41.365 --> 35:43.045
...the Lake of Shining Waters...

35:43.285 --> 35:46.004
...the smell of the lilacs,
the sound of the spring peepers.

35:47.404 --> 35:49.004
I could go on and on.

35:49.604 --> 35:51.044
But what do I want?

35:51.244 --> 35:53.844
Well, mainly two things.

35:56.324 --> 36:00.084
Please let me stay
at Green Gables forever.

36:00.324 --> 36:02.044
And please...

36:02.284 --> 36:03.924
...let me be good-looking
when I grow up.

36:05.524 --> 36:09.044
Your humble servant,
etcetera etcetera, Anne Shirley.

36:10.124 --> 36:12.084
I think that was good,
don't you Marilla?

36:12.604 --> 36:15.524
I could have made it more
flowery if I'd had more time.

36:15.764 --> 36:18.804
And I probably should have said
Amen at the end. What do you think?

36:19.364 --> 36:21.004
Do you think it will make
a difference?

36:21.244 --> 36:23.044
I think we should get you
to church.

36:30.644 --> 36:32.483
Etcetera etcetera.

36:39.323 --> 36:41.043
Marilla found these for you.

36:41.283 --> 36:42.443
They're lovely.

36:42.683 --> 36:44.243
Not new but almost.

36:44.803 --> 36:46.844
She thought one of them
might suit for church today.

36:47.083 --> 36:48.684
...and you can wear the others
to school.

36:48.763 --> 36:50.243
I'm going to school?

36:51.483 --> 36:54.123
Marilla's having one of her
aches in the old noggin.

36:54.363 --> 36:56.203
Dear. Is there anything I can do?

36:56.723 --> 36:59.763
It would make her happy
if you liked these dresses. Do you?

37:00.003 --> 37:01.403
I do...

37:01.643 --> 37:04.203
...and I am ever so grateful but...

37:04.443 --> 37:08.083
...I'd be so much more
gratefuller if...

37:08.403 --> 37:11.443
...if just one of
them had puffed sleeves.

37:13.163 --> 37:16.003
I have never heard of
puffed sleeves on a child's dress.

37:16.243 --> 37:18.082
Puffed sleeves are
all the fashion now.

37:18.762 --> 37:20.322
And it would be ever
so thrilling...

37:20.522 --> 37:22.163
...if I could wear
a puffed sleeves dress.

37:22.442 --> 37:24.802
Even just one time in my life.

37:26.522 --> 37:30.242
I suppose you can take that up
with Marilla. And do so quietly.

37:30.482 --> 37:33.482
And in the meantime, could you
chose one of these for church?

37:42.362 --> 37:43.442
Marilla?

37:50.482 --> 37:53.602
I chose this outfit
for church today.

37:57.162 --> 37:59.242
That's good. It's plain and simple.

37:59.842 --> 38:01.442
But...

38:02.122 --> 38:04.202
...I was wondering if...

38:04.442 --> 38:07.441
...if I can also have a dress
with puffed sleeves.

38:07.921 --> 38:09.681
It would give me such a thrill.

38:09.921 --> 38:12.161
You'll have to let go of
your thrills.

38:12.401 --> 38:15.121
Puffed sleeves are a fad
and they look ridiculous.

38:15.361 --> 38:17.242
I'd rather look ridiculous like
everyone else...

38:17.481 --> 38:19.401
...than look plain and simple
all by myself.

38:19.641 --> 38:21.841
Nonsense. Plain and simple is good.

38:30.081 --> 38:32.041
Could you put that on my dresser?

38:38.001 --> 38:39.961
Like a Royal Jewel.

38:40.601 --> 38:42.521
What is that glorious stone?

38:42.761 --> 38:44.241
It's an amethyst.

38:45.481 --> 38:48.401
You can open up, if you like.
There's a picture inside.

38:53.480 --> 38:54.880
Is that your mother?

39:00.120 --> 39:01.760
She looks like you.

39:02.800 --> 39:05.920
I guess, you look like her
is more correct.

39:06.840 --> 39:08.440
Put that on my dresser.
Go on.

39:09.440 --> 39:12.000
You're going to have to walk
by yourself to the church today.

39:13.160 --> 39:15.080
It's not very far.
You're gonna be all right?

39:15.760 --> 39:17.800
Yes, I love to walk.

39:18.040 --> 39:20.480
Especially on a tree-lined
country road.

39:21.320 --> 39:23.456
Although this will be my first
time I've actually ever walked...

39:23.480 --> 39:25.360
...on a tree-lined country road.

39:25.600 --> 39:26.680
Off you go.

39:58.319 --> 39:59.799
Who is that?

40:01.719 --> 40:04.119
That's the orphan with the red hair
I was telling you about.

40:08.919 --> 40:10.399
What have she done to her hat?

40:22.239 --> 40:25.558
Rachel said she nearly sank
through the floor when she saw you.

40:26.278 --> 40:28.358
People are gonna think
that it's all my fault.

40:28.838 --> 40:31.294
I'm sorry, Marilla. I didn't know
it was wrong to wear flowers.

40:31.318 --> 40:33.398
It's not wrong, it's just...

40:34.438 --> 40:37.478
Tell me child, do all of your
little friends behave like you do?

40:37.718 --> 40:41.118
I've never had a friend,
at least not my own age.

40:41.998 --> 40:45.558
You never had a friend? We'll
have to do something about that.

40:52.398 --> 40:54.398
No reason to feel cobblesome.

40:55.878 --> 40:57.398
Just don't use any of
your long words.

40:57.638 --> 40:59.518
They'll think you're odd.

41:01.198 --> 41:02.998
What if Diana doesn't like me?

41:03.518 --> 41:06.998
My dear girl, it's Mrs. Barry
you have to worry about.

41:07.238 --> 41:10.038
If she doesn't like you, it doesn't
matter what Diana thinks.

41:11.478 --> 41:13.317
All right now,
you mind your Ps and Qs.

41:20.517 --> 41:23.037
- Well now, good morning, Marilla?
- Hello.

41:23.277 --> 41:25.917
- And you must be Anne.
- How do you do, Misses Bary?

41:26.157 --> 41:27.157
Please.

41:42.317 --> 41:43.477
Hello Diana.

41:43.717 --> 41:45.277
Good afternoon, Miss Cuthbert.

41:45.517 --> 41:47.357
Diana, this is Anne.

41:47.597 --> 41:49.877
Anne, this is my little girl,
Diana.

41:50.117 --> 41:51.197
How do you do?

41:52.557 --> 41:55.597
Darling, why don't take Anne for
a nice walk around the property?

41:55.837 --> 41:57.397
Yes, mother. Come.

42:01.836 --> 42:04.996
My goodness, is she not the most
scrumptious little apricot?

42:05.236 --> 42:06.316
Yeah.

42:06.956 --> 42:07.956
Yeah.

42:08.996 --> 42:10.676
My mother says
you're a strange bird.

42:10.916 --> 42:12.316
I'd like to be a bird.

42:13.156 --> 42:14.796
Sometimes you talk to trees?

42:15.036 --> 42:18.796
I do as well. Of course, I know
it's only the wind in the leaves...

42:19.036 --> 42:22.396
...but I like to think, well,
it's something else.

42:22.876 --> 42:24.876
Let's pretend. I mean, together.

42:25.116 --> 42:27.156
- Pretend what?
- Anything you like.

42:27.956 --> 42:29.332
Do you want to see
my secret island?

42:29.356 --> 42:30.516
Why's it a secret?

42:30.756 --> 42:32.756
- Fairies live there.
- Really?

42:33.556 --> 42:35.717
But you have to be very quiet
or you'll scare them off.

42:35.756 --> 42:36.796
I know that.

42:37.156 --> 42:39.636
- Shall we go?
- Yes!

42:40.556 --> 42:41.876
Have you ever seen a fairy?

42:43.036 --> 42:45.795
I did once, but I don't think
it had wings.

42:46.035 --> 42:49.715
Only special ones have wings.
These ones have very soft voices.

43:03.395 --> 43:06.115
Most beautiful place
I've ever seen.

43:06.915 --> 43:08.075
Listen.

43:12.315 --> 43:15.995
Diana? Would you like to be
my bosom friend?

43:16.995 --> 43:18.515
I don't see why not.

43:18.755 --> 43:20.835
- Will you swear to it?
- It's wicked to swear.

43:21.075 --> 43:23.275
Not that kind of swearing,
the other kind.

43:24.075 --> 43:25.235
What other kind?

43:25.475 --> 43:26.595
Close your eyes.

43:30.435 --> 43:32.394
I, Anne Shirley...

43:32.594 --> 43:36.674
...do solemnly swear to be faithful
to my bosom friend, Diana Barry...

43:36.914 --> 43:40.234
...as long as the sun
and moon shall endure.

43:41.994 --> 43:43.914
Now you say it
and put my name in.

43:46.354 --> 43:48.554
I, Diana Barry...

43:48.794 --> 43:51.434
...do solemnly swear...

43:51.754 --> 43:53.195
- To be faithful.
- To be faithful...

43:53.234 --> 43:55.354
...to my bosom friend,
Anne Shirley...

43:56.434 --> 44:00.034
...for as long as the sun
and moon shall endure.

44:10.714 --> 44:12.354
Shoo!

44:35.873 --> 44:37.033
Hello.

44:38.633 --> 44:39.953
What's your name?

44:43.553 --> 44:46.553
I'll call you Guinevre.

45:16.592 --> 45:18.872
A picnic, huh?
That's something.

45:19.112 --> 45:20.672
Yes. There's going to be...

45:20.872 --> 45:22.712
...a rowing boat race
on McMurrich river.

45:22.952 --> 45:24.408
...and three-legged race
on The Common.

45:24.432 --> 45:25.848
And Mrs. Lynde is going to
make ice cream.

45:25.872 --> 45:27.712
I've never tasted ice cream.

45:27.912 --> 45:29.712
Diana tried to explain
that to me but...

45:29.952 --> 45:31.232
Anne Shirley!

45:44.312 --> 45:46.192
Have you seen my amethyst brooch?

45:47.592 --> 45:49.552
Last time I saw it was...

45:53.271 --> 45:55.751
I know, it was yesterday.

45:56.311 --> 45:58.151
While you were away
at the your meeting.

45:58.351 --> 46:00.911
I was passing your door
when I saw it...

46:01.151 --> 46:02.431
...so I went in to look.

46:03.471 --> 46:04.671
And then?

46:05.391 --> 46:09.671
And then I took it up and I pinned
it on to see how it looked.

46:09.911 --> 46:11.831
Then I put it right back.
- Put it back where?

46:12.071 --> 46:13.311
On the bureau.

46:20.271 --> 46:22.551
No, really, I put it straight back.

46:22.791 --> 46:24.871
I believe you are telling me
a falsehood.

46:25.391 --> 46:27.071
I swear, I didn't...

46:27.271 --> 46:28.847
You go into your room
and don't you come out...

46:28.871 --> 46:30.311
...until you are ready to confess.

46:30.511 --> 46:31.671
Go on.

46:44.670 --> 46:45.790
Marilla?

46:47.470 --> 46:48.950
I took the brooch.

46:49.470 --> 46:51.390
I didn't mean to,
but I was overcome...

46:51.590 --> 46:53.430
...by an irresistible temptation.

46:53.670 --> 46:55.286
I took it with me
when I went to Diana's...

46:55.310 --> 46:56.710
...so I could play Lady Cordelia.

46:56.950 --> 46:59.150
I thought I could put it back
before you came home.

46:59.390 --> 47:00.766
But when I was crossing
the bridge...

47:00.790 --> 47:02.846
...it slipped through my fingers
and dropped down into...

47:02.870 --> 47:05.390
...the purple sparkling waves
and sank for evermore...

47:05.630 --> 47:06.951
...in the Lake of Shining Waters.

47:07.510 --> 47:09.950
Anne Shirley, you are the most
aggravating child...

47:10.150 --> 47:11.470
...I have ever met.

47:11.670 --> 47:13.070
I suppose I am.

47:13.310 --> 47:15.190
And I know I'll have to be
punished.

47:16.430 --> 47:18.630
But can you please get it over with
right away?

47:18.870 --> 47:20.166
Because I'd like to go
to the picnic...

47:20.190 --> 47:22.430
...with nothing on my conscience.
- Picnic?

47:23.870 --> 47:25.230
It's tomorrow.

47:25.470 --> 47:27.309
There'll be no picnic for you.

47:28.669 --> 47:30.789
But that's why I confessed.

47:33.829 --> 47:36.869
Marilla, please let me go.
Think of the ice cream.

47:37.109 --> 47:39.229
I may never have a chance
to taste it ever again.

47:39.469 --> 47:42.509
Ice crime? Do you have any idea
what that brooch meant to me?

47:43.149 --> 47:45.469
Why do you always causing
so much trouble?

47:46.309 --> 47:48.389
Red hair makes it easier
to be bad than good.

47:48.989 --> 47:50.725
People who don't have it
cannot understand...

47:50.749 --> 47:52.309
...what terrible trouble it is.

47:52.589 --> 47:55.349
There'll be no picnic for you.
And that's final.

48:09.669 --> 48:11.309
Josie, have you seen Anne?

48:11.549 --> 48:13.188
I don't understand what you
see in her.

48:13.388 --> 48:15.028
I mean she's just a charity case.

48:15.468 --> 48:16.948
My mother said that as soon as...

48:17.148 --> 48:19.509
...the Cuthberts find a home
for her, she'll be moving away.

48:20.628 --> 48:23.348
Josie Pye, you are the meanest girl
on all of Prince Edward Island.

48:57.228 --> 48:59.148
Dear life and heart.

49:04.347 --> 49:05.427
Anne?

49:17.627 --> 49:21.387
I apologize. I never should have
doubted your word.

49:23.027 --> 49:26.987
And maybe you better go on comb
your hair and put on your gingham.

49:28.547 --> 49:30.307
Go on, be quick about it.

49:51.426 --> 49:53.146
Anne!

49:53.906 --> 49:55.186
You came!

49:56.626 --> 49:57.666
Come on.

50:05.346 --> 50:08.186
That's Gilbert Blythe.
He teases all the girls.

50:10.426 --> 50:11.746
So I can see.

50:11.986 --> 50:14.266
But he's fair handsome,
don't you think?

50:18.986 --> 50:20.706
Here you go.

50:21.266 --> 50:22.506
Thank you, Mrs. Lynde.

50:22.746 --> 50:25.466
It's my first time ever
in my life tasting ice cream.

50:32.066 --> 50:33.146
Well?

50:41.705 --> 50:43.345
Is it not scrumptious?

50:44.505 --> 50:46.105
I would say...

50:50.345 --> 50:51.945
...sublime.

50:58.545 --> 51:00.505
Here, now. Stand still.

51:00.745 --> 51:03.065
It has always been my deepest
desire to have an education.

51:03.305 --> 51:06.105
Well, I'm sure you'll be fine
as long as you don't talk too much.

51:06.385 --> 51:07.865
Bye, Matthew.

51:10.625 --> 51:13.105
- Hardly seems possible
- What?

51:13.825 --> 51:15.306
She's only been with us
four months...

51:15.425 --> 51:17.465
...and it's like she's always
been here.

51:19.465 --> 51:21.744
Stop your sentimental drivel.
It's unbecoming.

51:22.264 --> 51:24.984
And don't you get to attached
Matthew Cuthbert.

52:06.943 --> 52:07.943
Good morning, sir.

52:08.183 --> 52:09.423
Good morning, Mr. Phillips.

52:11.783 --> 52:13.423
- Diana, where do we sit?
- Don't worry.

52:13.663 --> 52:15.543
- I'm so nervous.
- Come on.

52:19.463 --> 52:21.383
Sit here. Sit here beside me.

52:24.423 --> 52:27.223
Scholars! Up!

52:28.303 --> 52:29.503
It fell out.

52:30.463 --> 52:31.663
See what I mean?

52:31.903 --> 52:33.383
Far too bold and poorly mannered.

52:33.623 --> 52:37.423
Scholars! That's enough!
Show respect for The King!

52:42.943 --> 52:47.903
God save our gracious King

52:48.143 --> 52:52.623
Long live our noble King

52:52.863 --> 52:56.982
God save the King

52:57.462 --> 53:02.142
Send him victorious

53:02.382 --> 53:06.702
Happy and glorious

53:06.942 --> 53:10.222
Long to reign over us

53:10.502 --> 53:11.502
Good.

53:12.142 --> 53:13.782
Hey, you.

53:14.502 --> 53:16.502
Anne, hey!

53:22.262 --> 53:24.622
- That's right.
- Ding dong.

53:26.422 --> 53:27.822
Hello there, Carrots.

53:28.702 --> 53:29.862
How dare you?

53:30.102 --> 53:31.822
Hey, don't go haywire.

53:32.022 --> 53:33.583
I was only trying to
get your attention.

53:33.822 --> 53:36.382
You are a mean and hateful boy
and I won't ever forgive you.

53:38.062 --> 53:39.542
What's this disturbance?

53:42.421 --> 53:45.421
It's my fault sir. I teased her.

53:45.661 --> 53:47.061
Thank you, Percy. Please sit.

53:49.141 --> 53:51.381
Anne Shirley, come and stand
at the blackboard...

53:51.621 --> 53:54.261
...and you will stay here
for the remainder of the day. Come.

53:58.261 --> 54:02.501
I will control...

54:03.341 --> 54:06.301
...my temper.

54:09.021 --> 54:11.661
Read it, believe it
and then start behaving...

54:11.861 --> 54:13.501
...like a civilized human being.

54:13.741 --> 54:14.781
Do you understand?

54:15.021 --> 54:17.461
Yes. But can I just say something
on my behalf?

54:17.701 --> 54:19.181
No, you may not.

54:25.381 --> 54:26.981
I'm sorry I made fun of your hair.

54:27.261 --> 54:28.940
Honest I am.
- No, you're not!

54:29.180 --> 54:30.500
Give me a chance.

54:30.740 --> 54:33.340
- I won't. Not ever!
- Why's that?

54:33.580 --> 54:35.700
Because I said I wouldn't
and I always keep my word.

54:36.300 --> 54:39.300
- But that's not a real reason.
- It is to me.

54:39.700 --> 54:41.380
Anne!

54:42.900 --> 54:45.300
Why did you do that?
You could have injured him.

54:46.860 --> 54:48.180
That was the point.

54:48.420 --> 54:51.180
Gilbert Blythe hurt my feelings
excruciatingly.

54:51.420 --> 54:53.020
I told you, remember?

54:53.260 --> 54:55.181
Gilbert makes fun of all the girls,
not just you.

54:56.820 --> 54:59.140
The cold iron has entered my soul.

54:59.660 --> 55:05.300
I believe, for me, the pursuit of
education no longer has meaning.

55:17.939 --> 55:20.579
Hello young lady.
How was school today?

55:22.659 --> 55:24.499
I doubt I shall return.

55:24.739 --> 55:26.659
Really? But why is that?

55:27.139 --> 55:28.859
My honor has been tarnished.

55:29.099 --> 55:31.219
Honor's a prize for fools.

55:33.659 --> 55:35.059
Anne Shirley!

55:39.299 --> 55:41.539
I have a meeting on
Saturday afternoon in town.

55:41.779 --> 55:43.419
Why don't you ask
your friend, Diana...

55:43.659 --> 55:45.075
...when you go back to school
tomorrow...

55:45.099 --> 55:46.740
...if she wants to come over
and have tea.

55:48.859 --> 55:50.579
Really, Marilla? Do you mean it?

55:50.819 --> 55:52.755
Of course I mean it.
I never joke about anything...

55:52.779 --> 55:54.219
...as important as friendship.

56:05.738 --> 56:08.978
Miss Barry, do you come in.
My, what a lovely frock.

56:09.218 --> 56:11.218
This? My morning dress.

56:11.458 --> 56:13.378
In the afternoons I usually wear
blue satin.

56:13.618 --> 56:15.898
The tea should be steeped by now.
Do you come in.

56:17.938 --> 56:20.058
And pray, how is your dear mother?

56:20.298 --> 56:23.858
Very well, thank you, though she
has a bad case of hives.

56:24.098 --> 56:25.258
What was that?

56:25.978 --> 56:27.058
Never mind.

56:27.818 --> 56:31.058
Would you care for some fruit cake?
Marilla is an excellent cook.

56:31.618 --> 56:32.778
Marilla?

56:33.298 --> 56:34.418
My maid.

56:34.698 --> 56:36.594
Holy cats. Marilla said
we could share some of her...

56:36.618 --> 56:38.978
...raspberry cordial.
Be back in a jiffy.

56:39.578 --> 56:41.218
That is to say,
if you'll be so kind...

56:41.418 --> 56:43.418
...as to excuse me for a moment?

56:43.658 --> 56:45.018
Of course.

57:09.617 --> 57:13.097
That's an awfully nice raspberry
cordial, Miss Shirley.

57:13.457 --> 57:15.137
Would you care for another drop?

57:18.257 --> 57:21.617
I didn't know raspberry cordials
could taste so awfully nice.

57:21.857 --> 57:22.897
But it is.

57:37.696 --> 57:41.376
I'd have some myself
if I wasn't so full of cake.

57:41.616 --> 57:43.016
Would you like another slice?

57:59.616 --> 58:01.456
Are you...

58:05.456 --> 58:07.576
Are you all right?

58:07.816 --> 58:10.416
I feel rather coggly.

58:10.816 --> 58:12.216
Sit down, I'll pour your tea.

58:12.456 --> 58:13.696
I have to go.

58:17.216 --> 58:18.256
Anne!

58:18.936 --> 58:20.416
- In here!
- Anne!

58:22.015 --> 58:24.175
Anne, I just had a talk
with Mrs. Barry.

58:24.415 --> 58:27.215
She tells me that you are never
allowed to play with Diana again.

58:27.575 --> 58:28.575
Why?

58:28.815 --> 58:31.935
Apparently, she came home drunk.
Can you explain that?

58:33.255 --> 58:35.215
- Drunk?
- What did you give her?

58:35.455 --> 58:36.495
Just...

58:36.735 --> 58:39.015
You said I could serve
raspberry cordial.

58:39.815 --> 58:40.975
Show me the bottle.

58:51.095 --> 58:54.455
Anne Shirley, you have
a genius for getting into trouble.

58:54.935 --> 58:57.416
This is my red currant wine.
Could you not tell the difference?

58:57.615 --> 58:59.175
I didn't taste it myself.

59:00.055 --> 59:02.536
Marilla, what am I gonna do?
Diana is my bosom friend for life.

59:02.655 --> 59:03.855
We swore an oath.

59:04.095 --> 59:05.671
It's all right. There's no need
for tears.

59:05.695 --> 59:06.871
I believe that you're
telling me the truth.

59:06.895 --> 59:10.214
I'll go and speak to Mrs. Barry.
Don't worry about it.

59:26.374 --> 59:27.454
Marilla!

59:28.054 --> 59:29.054
Marilla!

59:29.294 --> 59:30.614
Did you speak to Mrs. Barry?

59:30.934 --> 59:32.854
Is everything all right?
Did she understand?

59:33.094 --> 59:35.494
I tried to wait for you when
you got home but I fell asleep.

59:35.734 --> 59:38.734
Diana's mother
had quite a lot to say about it.

59:39.654 --> 59:41.054
She doesn't think...

59:41.374 --> 59:44.294
Well, she feels that you're not
the fit companion for her daughter.

59:44.534 --> 59:46.414
Why am I not a fit companion?

59:47.574 --> 59:50.214
Believe me, Diana was just
as upset about it as you are.

59:50.454 --> 59:52.214
It's not fair!

01:00:20.533 --> 01:00:21.773
Matthew!

01:00:22.893 --> 01:00:24.133
Matthew!

01:00:24.453 --> 01:00:26.013
Here. Come on.
Get up.

01:00:26.253 --> 01:00:27.733
- No.
- No, you are all right.

01:00:27.973 --> 01:00:28.973
- I'm all right.
- Come.

01:00:29.213 --> 01:00:31.453
Just a little dizzy spell.

01:00:32.373 --> 01:00:34.493
Stop. Give me that. Come on.

01:00:34.773 --> 01:00:36.333
Come.

01:00:39.733 --> 01:00:41.613
Give us a nice breath.

01:00:43.972 --> 01:00:45.012
One more.

01:00:52.012 --> 01:00:56.332
Well, there is a little bit of
heart flutter there.

01:00:56.572 --> 01:01:00.372
It's a warning. You're not
as young as you used to be.

01:01:00.612 --> 01:01:02.133
Is there anything
you could do for him?

01:01:02.252 --> 01:01:07.132
Try not to exert yourself
and avoid too much excitement.

01:01:07.372 --> 01:01:09.292
It would be harder to find some.

01:01:10.012 --> 01:01:13.692
Some truth in that.
Well, I gotta be going.

01:01:13.932 --> 01:01:15.972
- Thanks George. So long.
- Your welcome.

01:01:18.052 --> 01:01:19.852
Is he all right to be left alone?

01:01:20.092 --> 01:01:23.852
I am not alone. Anne is here.
We're kindred spirits.

01:01:38.411 --> 01:01:39.611
Your move.

01:01:50.251 --> 01:01:53.251
Ruby Gillis says that
when a man is courting...

01:01:53.491 --> 01:01:55.131
...he always has to agree with...

01:01:55.411 --> 01:02:00.971
...the girl's mother on religion
and her father on politics.

01:02:02.051 --> 01:02:03.291
Is that always true?

01:02:03.531 --> 01:02:05.531
Well, I'm not so sure.

01:02:05.771 --> 01:02:06.811
Your move.

01:02:07.411 --> 01:02:08.651
Have you ever been courting?

01:02:08.971 --> 01:02:13.851
Of course I did. But you know,
being a poor farmer...

01:02:14.091 --> 01:02:16.730
...on the remote island,
possibilities were limited.

01:02:17.810 --> 01:02:19.050
What about Marilla?

01:02:19.930 --> 01:02:20.970
Did she ever have a beau?

01:02:21.210 --> 01:02:24.450
Yeah, she did. Long ago
and it didn't work out I'm afraid.

01:02:25.010 --> 01:02:26.970
But you mustn't bring it up to her.

01:02:27.210 --> 01:02:28.290
What happened?

01:02:28.730 --> 01:02:31.570
Well, as I recall, he was a
good decent fellow but...

01:02:32.690 --> 01:02:36.050
...our mother didn't see it
that way exactly.

01:02:37.370 --> 01:02:38.690
And that was that?

01:02:39.850 --> 01:02:41.410
That was that.

01:02:42.730 --> 01:02:44.130
Anne!

01:02:48.650 --> 01:02:50.251
Minnie May has croup.
She's awful sick...

01:02:50.570 --> 01:02:52.706
...and mother and father aren't
home and I need to get a doctor.

01:02:52.730 --> 01:02:55.090
I'm so scared!
- Don't be scared child.

01:02:55.330 --> 01:02:58.250
No. You stay there and stay warm.
I'll take care of it.

01:02:58.530 --> 01:02:59.850
I've been around many babies.

01:03:00.090 --> 01:03:02.050
Now, does Marilla have any Ipecac?

01:03:02.289 --> 01:03:03.905
Yes, it is in the kitchen.
Over the stove.

01:03:03.929 --> 01:03:04.929
Come on.

01:03:09.289 --> 01:03:11.009
Anne, I'm so afraid
that she could die.

01:03:11.249 --> 01:03:12.569
You go fetch Doctor Spencer.

01:03:20.809 --> 01:03:24.609
Hello, Minnie May.
It's Anne. Do you remember me?

01:03:24.849 --> 01:03:26.209
I'm Diana's friend.

01:03:26.609 --> 01:03:28.329
I've come to help you feel better.

01:03:32.489 --> 01:03:35.209
I need hot water
and some soft cloths.

01:03:36.529 --> 01:03:40.649
Okay, Minnie May, I want you to
sit up and drink a little of this.

01:03:40.889 --> 01:03:42.289
I don't want to.

01:03:43.409 --> 01:03:45.689
I promise you will
start to feel better.

01:03:45.929 --> 01:03:47.449
I don't want to.

01:03:48.729 --> 01:03:52.408
I'll tell you what,
you drink a spoonful...

01:03:54.368 --> 01:03:58.008
...and I'll tell you
a wonderful story.

01:04:04.608 --> 01:04:08.928
Once upon a time there were
two beautiful maidens...

01:04:09.168 --> 01:04:11.848
...called Geraldine and Cordelia.

01:04:12.648 --> 01:04:16.048
Cordelia was dark-haired
with an alabaster brow.

01:04:16.648 --> 01:04:19.608
Geraldine was blonde
with hair like spun gold...

01:04:19.968 --> 01:04:22.648
...and eyes a velvety purple.

01:04:23.728 --> 01:04:25.928
Purple? I like purple.

01:04:26.688 --> 01:04:27.688
Me too.

01:04:32.088 --> 01:04:34.248
Anne, someone here to see you.

01:04:44.327 --> 01:04:46.887
Anne, dear.
Your quick thinking...

01:04:47.127 --> 01:04:49.567
...may have saved
my little girl's life.

01:04:50.207 --> 01:04:53.687
I think you are a wonderful
brave girl...

01:04:53.927 --> 01:04:56.607
...and I hope that you and
Diana can still be good friends.

01:04:57.727 --> 01:04:59.047
What do you say?

01:04:59.607 --> 01:05:02.527
Mrs. Barry, I want you to know
I harbor no ill feelings of...

01:05:02.767 --> 01:05:03.887
...any sort.

01:05:04.167 --> 01:05:06.047
Thanks be to goodness for that.

01:05:06.287 --> 01:05:09.967
Henceforth I shall cover the past
with a mantle of oblivion.

01:05:10.407 --> 01:05:11.447
Thank you.

01:05:15.447 --> 01:05:18.967
My Diana couldn't have
a more fit bosom friend.

01:05:26.006 --> 01:05:28.126
Come now,
the barn is a little dusty.

01:05:29.286 --> 01:05:32.326
Good bye, Marilla.
Say my best to Matthew.

01:05:52.206 --> 01:05:53.726
Come on. That's it.

01:05:54.766 --> 01:05:55.966
Come on.

01:05:58.726 --> 01:05:59.806
Come on.

01:06:09.845 --> 01:06:12.005
Marilla, I've milked the cow
and fed the chickens.

01:06:12.245 --> 01:06:14.125
Please, may I go tobogganing
with my friends?

01:06:14.365 --> 01:06:15.725
The sun's barely up.

01:06:15.965 --> 01:06:18.205
Please. It's so beautiful outside.

01:06:19.325 --> 01:06:20.406
Be home in time for dinner.

01:06:20.645 --> 01:06:22.405
I will. Thank you!

01:06:27.045 --> 01:06:29.005
Diana, wait!

01:06:38.245 --> 01:06:40.005
What are you so owly about?

01:06:41.245 --> 01:06:43.285
Did she say where they were going?

01:06:44.085 --> 01:06:46.285
- Tobogganing.
- I know that, but where?

01:06:46.765 --> 01:06:49.845
The best tobogganing hills are
around the Cochand's pond.

01:06:51.085 --> 01:06:54.685
And the ice's certain spots are
so thin at this time of the year.

01:06:56.244 --> 01:06:58.084
May be better hitch up Harry.

01:07:01.804 --> 01:07:02.804
Come on, Harry.

01:07:07.684 --> 01:07:09.004
Come on, boy.

01:07:27.804 --> 01:07:29.404
Wanna see something strange?

01:07:29.884 --> 01:07:31.844
- What?
- Come on, I'll show you.

01:07:32.324 --> 01:07:34.124
- What's it?
- Upsidedown Man.

01:07:34.364 --> 01:07:36.260
It's only a stupid joke.
Somebody does it every year.

01:07:36.284 --> 01:07:37.924
- It's no joke.
- Of course it is.

01:07:38.164 --> 01:07:39.284
Dare you to find out?

01:07:39.524 --> 01:07:42.324
No, Josie Pye, we're not allowed
to pond. You know that.

01:07:42.564 --> 01:07:44.043
It's been frozen solid for a month.

01:07:44.283 --> 01:07:45.484
Josie Pye, don't you tell lie.

01:07:45.523 --> 01:07:46.563
I'll do it.

01:07:46.803 --> 01:07:48.443
No, You don't have to do anything.

01:07:48.683 --> 01:07:50.843
Does so. I dared her.
So she has to.

01:07:51.083 --> 01:07:52.603
It's all right.
Really, I don't mind.

01:07:53.083 --> 01:07:56.523
Besides, every challenge
is an adventure.

01:08:09.523 --> 01:08:10.643
Wow.

01:08:12.323 --> 01:08:14.683
I can see all the way down
to the bottom.

01:08:16.283 --> 01:08:17.683
It's wonderful.

01:08:21.683 --> 01:08:23.962
It's like being in
a glass bottom boat.

01:08:25.603 --> 01:08:27.363
Whoo Harry!

01:08:41.482 --> 01:08:43.162
- Help!
- Oh my gosh!

01:08:43.402 --> 01:08:46.202
Help, please! Get someone!

01:08:46.442 --> 01:08:50.322
Anybody, get someone!
It's so cold, please!

01:08:50.562 --> 01:08:53.082
I'm cold! I can't get out!
- Hold on!

01:08:53.322 --> 01:08:55.283
- Get somebody!
- You kids, get back from the ice!

01:08:55.322 --> 01:08:57.082
Get back!
- Get away!

01:08:57.322 --> 01:09:00.042
- Oh my gosh! Please!
- Come on!

01:09:01.002 --> 01:09:03.442
- Stay come now, Miss Anne.
- You're gonna be okay!

01:09:03.682 --> 01:09:05.921
Please! Come faster!

01:09:06.202 --> 01:09:08.282
I'm cold, please! Faster!

01:09:08.921 --> 01:09:13.122
Matthew! Matthew, come on, please!
I can't get out!

01:09:13.362 --> 01:09:16.482
I know! Please!
- Hang on there.

01:09:17.961 --> 01:09:21.680
I'm stuck! Please!

01:09:23.001 --> 01:09:26.161
Hold on, Kindred Spirit,
I'm gonna get you out.

01:09:27.401 --> 01:09:30.801
I know, please!
Matthew, please!

01:09:31.640 --> 01:09:32.680
Matthew!

01:09:32.921 --> 01:09:37.201
Okay. Reach out.
I'm almost there.

01:09:37.600 --> 01:09:43.600
Yes, girl, reach out!
Yes! Miss Anne with an "e". Yes!

01:09:46.241 --> 01:09:49.121
Anne, what were you thinking
going out on the ice like that?

01:09:49.361 --> 01:09:51.921
Imagine what would have happened
if Matthew hadn't sensed it.

01:09:52.161 --> 01:09:54.361
And not just to you.
To him as well.

01:09:54.601 --> 01:09:57.241
He shouldn't be doing dangerous
things like that at his age.

01:09:57.481 --> 01:09:58.762
Of course it's not stopping him.

01:09:58.961 --> 01:10:01.161
I was foolish Marilla.
I was. I know that now.

01:10:01.361 --> 01:10:03.440
And I won't do anything like it
ever again.

01:10:03.680 --> 01:10:06.240
All right, well. You're normal.

01:10:06.440 --> 01:10:08.160
At least your temperature
seems to be.

01:10:08.360 --> 01:10:09.840
Now, I want you to lie down.

01:10:11.400 --> 01:10:14.760
I want you to not to imagine
things, not to be thinking...

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:17.361
...and I want you to try to
get some sleep. Can you do that?

01:10:17.400 --> 01:10:19.000
- I will, promise.
- All right.

01:10:34.040 --> 01:10:35.400
Where did you get them?

01:10:35.640 --> 01:10:36.801
I pick 'em up now and then...

01:10:37.040 --> 01:10:39.880
...whenever I go walking along
the sea shore.

01:10:40.840 --> 01:10:42.400
They're beautiful.

01:10:42.640 --> 01:10:44.840
Now, tell me all about
this concert of yours.

01:10:45.600 --> 01:10:49.160
We're going to have six choruses
and Diana is to sing a solo.

01:10:49.400 --> 01:10:51.959
And I'm to perform
as the Queen of the Fairies.

01:10:52.679 --> 01:10:55.079
Josie Pye said she'd never
heard of a red-headed fairy...

01:10:55.319 --> 01:10:57.199
...but I don't let myself mind
what Josie says.

01:10:57.439 --> 01:10:59.160
Well, I reckon it'll be a darn
good concert.

01:10:59.399 --> 01:11:01.039
You'll do your part just fine.

01:11:02.359 --> 01:11:03.759
Look.

01:11:05.639 --> 01:11:06.879
Can I show you?

01:11:10.359 --> 01:11:12.279
Remember the dress I was telling
you about?

01:11:13.919 --> 01:11:16.479
Diana already sent away
for one just like it.

01:11:23.239 --> 01:11:24.359
Matthew?

01:11:24.919 --> 01:11:26.319
Hello Rachel.

01:11:27.599 --> 01:11:28.639
How are you doing?

01:11:28.879 --> 01:11:30.719
Fair to middling. And yourself?

01:11:30.959 --> 01:11:33.999
I'm all right. Marilla told me
you wanted to see me.

01:11:35.119 --> 01:11:36.719
Well now, Rachel...

01:11:36.919 --> 01:11:40.678
...I know I have not always been
the most sociable neighbor.

01:11:40.918 --> 01:11:43.878
- There's a truth to that.
- I want a fresh start.

01:11:44.118 --> 01:11:46.198
That's charming likely,
Matthew Cuthbert.

01:11:46.478 --> 01:11:47.998
What you want is my help.

01:11:48.638 --> 01:11:50.358
And for what, pray tell?

01:11:50.598 --> 01:11:53.598
You know, I have always admire
your sewing skills.

01:11:58.518 --> 01:12:00.518
Just try this.

01:12:01.638 --> 01:12:03.438
Not the red balls.
Gold ones.

01:12:03.678 --> 01:12:04.758
All right.

01:12:08.478 --> 01:12:10.078
How are we doing in over here?

01:12:14.318 --> 01:12:15.358
Yes, that's fine.

01:12:15.598 --> 01:12:17.079
Diana, can you give me
another ribbon?

01:12:18.078 --> 01:12:19.558
Give me that.

01:12:22.878 --> 01:12:24.397
Why you're here?

01:12:25.277 --> 01:12:26.837
For your safety.

01:12:28.837 --> 01:12:30.357
Thank you, Gilbert.

01:12:39.357 --> 01:12:43.117
Here, put that over there. There's
big space over there. You see that?

01:12:43.717 --> 01:12:45.877
Excuse me, Anne.

01:12:46.317 --> 01:12:48.437
Since the concert is tomorrow
I thought you like...

01:12:48.637 --> 01:12:50.317
...your Christmas present early.

01:12:50.597 --> 01:12:51.997
Matthew Cuthbert, what on earth?

01:12:52.237 --> 01:12:53.917
I didn't want to bother you,
Marilla.

01:12:54.597 --> 01:12:56.717
You get your hands full
all the time.

01:12:56.957 --> 01:12:58.957
So, I spoke with Rachel.

01:12:59.197 --> 01:13:00.877
So that was what all that
was about.

01:13:01.117 --> 01:13:02.837
Yes, go on. Open it.

01:13:21.956 --> 01:13:23.636
Matthew.

01:13:25.636 --> 01:13:28.276
Yeah, this is a...

01:13:28.876 --> 01:13:30.796
- It's a pintuck.
- Pintuck. And this is...

01:13:30.996 --> 01:13:32.076
What do you call this?

01:13:32.276 --> 01:13:35.756
- A ruffle.
- Ruffle. And those are the sleeves.

01:13:36.396 --> 01:13:38.236
Puffed sleeves
you've always wanted.

01:13:39.396 --> 01:13:41.956
I've never had a pretty dress
in my life.

01:13:48.236 --> 01:13:49.676
Are you coming to the concert?

01:13:49.916 --> 01:13:52.876
Well, you know, I read my bible
and say my prayers...

01:13:53.116 --> 01:13:55.356
...but being in a small room
with a bunch of farmers...

01:13:55.596 --> 01:13:57.395
...it's not my idea of
Christian fellers.

01:13:57.635 --> 01:14:00.395
If it's all the same to you,
I would prefer to imagine it.

01:14:01.955 --> 01:14:03.595
Thank you, Matthew.

01:14:03.835 --> 01:14:04.835
Merry Christmas.

01:14:05.075 --> 01:14:07.155
Now, go upstairs
and try it on, why don't you?

01:14:09.915 --> 01:14:12.051
Matthew Cuthbert, sometimes
I think I don't understand...

01:14:12.075 --> 01:14:13.555
...the first thing about you.

01:14:13.755 --> 01:14:16.595
A young girl should have a
pretty dress in my opinion.

01:14:17.955 --> 01:14:20.515
I believe that's the first
opinion you've ever had.

01:14:20.755 --> 01:14:23.835
No. It's the first opinion I've
ever had out loud.

01:14:27.315 --> 01:14:29.795
Merry Christmas, Marilla.
God bless you.

01:14:30.915 --> 01:14:32.635
Merry Christmas, Matthew.

01:14:49.194 --> 01:14:51.714
Yes, they worked hard.

01:14:53.714 --> 01:14:56.434
I know, it's true.
I am sure it will be good.

01:14:56.634 --> 01:14:58.234
You're right. Thank you.

01:15:09.874 --> 01:15:11.994
Welcome to the concert
this evening.

01:15:19.994 --> 01:15:23.954
Smile and flap your wings.
Just like that.

01:15:28.754 --> 01:15:31.313
Come follow, follow me.

01:15:31.553 --> 01:15:33.713
You, fairy elves that be...

01:15:33.953 --> 01:15:36.273
...which circle on the green.

01:15:36.753 --> 01:15:39.393
Come follow Mab your queen.

01:16:48.232 --> 01:16:49.552
Good morning, Muriel.

01:16:51.432 --> 01:16:52.672
Today's a borrowed day.

01:16:52.912 --> 01:16:54.912
Yes, indeed. Spring has well
and truly sprung.

01:16:55.152 --> 01:16:56.873
Rachel said there was something
here for me.

01:16:56.992 --> 01:17:00.312
Indeed there is. From the
Presbyterian Orphan Homes.

01:17:03.552 --> 01:17:04.791
Take a look inside.

01:17:05.031 --> 01:17:06.831
They have already paid for
the train ticket.

01:17:10.551 --> 01:17:14.111
It must be a shock to finally
have the whole thing done with.

01:17:14.351 --> 01:17:16.351
I can't imagine your relief.

01:17:26.431 --> 01:17:29.711
I got a letter from Mrs. Haines
in Charlottetown.

01:17:31.471 --> 01:17:35.151
Remember, that Presbyterian outfit.

01:17:38.351 --> 01:17:40.311
They've found a home for Anne.

01:17:41.671 --> 01:17:43.391
They sent a train ticket.

01:17:45.991 --> 01:17:46.991
When?

01:17:48.111 --> 01:17:49.311
Tomorrow.

01:17:50.951 --> 01:17:51.990
Tomorrow?

01:17:56.110 --> 01:18:00.350
They says it's a real good family.
In Montreal. Very well off.

01:18:01.470 --> 01:18:05.190
They've got four children,
all around the Anne's age.

01:18:09.190 --> 01:18:11.270
It's the best thing for her,
Matthew.

01:18:11.950 --> 01:18:15.710
It's a great opportunity for her.

01:18:26.230 --> 01:18:27.350
Anne.

01:18:27.950 --> 01:18:29.630
It's all right, Marilla.

01:18:31.270 --> 01:18:33.550
Thank you for letting me stay
at Green Gables.

01:18:34.470 --> 01:18:36.630
Even if it was just for a while.

01:18:37.870 --> 01:18:40.349
I never felt truly at home
before this.

01:18:42.509 --> 01:18:44.149
Good night, Marilla.

01:18:51.829 --> 01:18:53.229
Good night, Anne.

01:20:41.107 --> 01:20:42.147
Marilla?

01:20:42.907 --> 01:20:44.987
Marilla Cuthbert, where are you?

01:20:47.507 --> 01:20:48.707
Marilla?

01:20:52.907 --> 01:20:53.947
Marilla?

01:20:54.187 --> 01:20:55.667
Rachel, I was just...

01:20:55.907 --> 01:20:58.666
Marilla. You know I'm the
last person to ever offer advice.

01:20:58.906 --> 01:20:59.906
That goes without saying.

01:21:00.146 --> 01:21:02.587
But I'm ordering you to go after
that girl and bring her back.

01:21:03.266 --> 01:21:04.946
Mrs. Beatty has found her
a real family.

01:21:05.186 --> 01:21:06.307
One that can look after her.

01:21:06.506 --> 01:21:07.826
Aren't you a real family?

01:21:08.106 --> 01:21:10.986
You and Matthew? You belong to her.
And she belongs to you.

01:21:11.266 --> 01:21:13.587
Now you go after that girl
and bring her home, do you hear?

01:21:14.106 --> 01:21:16.186
It's too late.
It's already set in motion.

01:21:16.426 --> 01:21:18.586
Rubbish. It's never too late to do
the right thing.

01:21:18.826 --> 01:21:21.227
Now, let's get going. Thomas is
right outside with the buggy.

01:21:36.586 --> 01:21:40.266
So, a government fellow
from the Agriculture Department...

01:21:40.506 --> 01:21:42.066
...was at post office
the other day.

01:21:42.306 --> 01:21:43.866
We're talking about
this and that...

01:21:44.466 --> 01:21:47.865
...I asked him about
what makes the roads red.

01:21:48.105 --> 01:21:51.305
He told me it was the iron
what did it.

01:21:56.545 --> 01:21:58.705
I found this very interesting.

01:22:24.345 --> 01:22:25.465
Anne!

01:22:30.945 --> 01:22:33.264
I know they've found you a
real good family.

01:22:33.704 --> 01:22:37.504
And they're gonna be able to
give you lots of things that we...

01:22:37.744 --> 01:22:39.105
...Matthew and me
couldn't provide.

01:22:40.104 --> 01:22:41.504
But the fact is...

01:22:44.624 --> 01:22:46.544
...we've come to think of you
as family.

01:22:51.504 --> 01:22:54.224
And now, I can't imagine life at
Green Gables without you.

01:22:57.664 --> 01:22:59.464
I don't want to imagine it.

01:23:00.104 --> 01:23:01.264
So...

01:23:04.184 --> 01:23:07.184
...how would you feel about
come and live with us...

01:23:08.344 --> 01:23:09.544
...for good?

01:23:18.304 --> 01:23:19.983
All right now, dear. All right.

01:23:20.863 --> 01:23:23.503
Get control of yourself. All right.

01:23:24.103 --> 01:23:26.943
Okay. Let's not overdo
the theatrics.

01:23:42.383 --> 01:23:45.623
Anne of Green Gables!
Lights out, young lady.

01:23:49.703 --> 01:23:52.343
Anne of Green Gables.
