00:36.480 --> 00:38.320
Oh, Jack.

00:38.320 --> 00:41.760
What? You're not firing up the old
furnace again, are you?

00:41.760 --> 00:43.120
Victor, not this again!

00:43.120 --> 00:46.440
Come on, I was sitting in here last
night, it was like Dickens' London.

00:46.440 --> 00:48.240
It was like a pea souper!

00:48.240 --> 00:50.120
Well, I enjoy the pipe at the telly.

00:50.120 --> 00:53.120
When you're enjoying the pipe,
I cannae see the bloody telly!

00:53.120 --> 00:55.680
What's to watch? It's all shite
anyway, right?

00:57.480 --> 01:00.120
I was thinking about chucking it
anyhow, the amount of tax

01:00.120 --> 01:02.320
they put on it. Well, that's what
this is about.

01:02.320 --> 01:04.440
Smokers clogging up the NHS.

01:04.440 --> 01:06.000
There's nae beds left.

01:06.000 --> 01:07.880
Good people cannae get one.

01:07.880 --> 01:10.240
Aye. Good people?

01:10.240 --> 01:13.040
You know. Them that don't smoke
cannae get a bed.

01:13.040 --> 01:16.440
So I'm bad people? I'm just saying,
you know, cos you smoke the pipe

01:16.440 --> 01:20.040
and you're a filthy addict.
A wee, clean living woman,

01:20.040 --> 01:22.160
wouldnae say boo to a goose
cannae get a lie down.

01:22.160 --> 01:25.040
So because I smoke the pipe,
that's me Fred West now?

01:26.120 --> 01:28.600
I'm not saying you're a murderer,
Jack. Good.

01:28.600 --> 01:31.120
I'm saying you're a nay-user junkie!

01:32.800 --> 01:36.560
What? I'm a...
You're a bastarding junkie!

01:36.560 --> 01:37.880
I'm junkie? How am I a junkie?

01:37.880 --> 01:40.560
Junkie with what? Biscuits,
wine gums, Mint Imperials.

01:40.560 --> 01:42.120
And I'll tell you another thing.

01:42.120 --> 01:44.800
I have paid for a stack of these
beds in that hospital

01:44.800 --> 01:47.080
with the amount of tax
I've paid on my baccy.

01:47.080 --> 01:49.880
They should be naming a ward after
me in the Royal Infirmary!

01:49.880 --> 01:52.360
Oh, aye, the "Jack Jarvis for them
that cannae stop puffing

01:52.360 --> 01:55.640
and some poor bastard with his arm
hanging off cannae get a bed" ward!

01:55.640 --> 01:56.680
Catchy!

01:58.400 --> 02:01.760
You know, I wish I didnae smoke
a pipe. I wish I smoked cigarettes.

02:01.760 --> 02:05.080
How's that? Cos I'd put one out
in your eye, that's how!

02:06.160 --> 02:11.640
PHONE RINGS

02:13.160 --> 02:14.640
Hello?

02:14.640 --> 02:15.880
Boabby?

02:15.880 --> 02:19.960
Uh-huh. Oh, dear.

02:21.480 --> 02:23.280
Thanks for ringing. Thank you.

02:41.680 --> 02:44.560
Oh, look who it is. Men In Black.

02:44.560 --> 02:46.560
What's that? The alien movie?

02:46.560 --> 02:50.400
We'll boot your baws
into outer space!

02:50.400 --> 02:52.000
Two pints, prick.

02:54.080 --> 02:58.000
Terrible day. I'll take a sweet
sherry, Boabby.

02:58.000 --> 03:01.200
Of course, darling.
15 people at a funeral.

03:01.200 --> 03:04.200
I hope that never happens to me.
You're not homeless.

03:04.200 --> 03:07.240
Pete lived under a bridge,
he was lucky to have 15 there!

03:07.240 --> 03:08.880
Half a lager please, Boabby.

03:08.880 --> 03:11.800
You'll not need your money
at the minute, Tam.

03:11.800 --> 03:12.840
There's a kitty.

03:14.520 --> 03:16.160
And a quadruple whisky.

03:18.560 --> 03:19.920
And tomato crisps.

03:22.000 --> 03:25.280
Tomato? And nuts. Dry roasted.

03:25.280 --> 03:28.240
My heart's roasted,
you miserable bastard!

03:28.240 --> 03:31.000
How much is it per head
for the kitty, Boabby?

03:31.000 --> 03:33.080
£12. I thought it was a tenner?

03:33.080 --> 03:35.640
Sorry, boys. Prices are up.

03:35.640 --> 03:38.120
It's not me. It's the brewery.

03:38.120 --> 03:40.520
Tam, kitty.

03:40.520 --> 03:42.600
HE MUMBLES INCOHERENTLY

03:44.920 --> 03:46.560
Poor Pete.

03:46.560 --> 03:48.880
Makes you realise how lucky you are.

03:48.880 --> 03:51.160
Lucky? I'm lucky I can walk.

03:52.440 --> 03:54.960
Who asks a one-legged man to
be a pallbearer?

03:56.160 --> 03:58.320
The leg's away! The leg's away!

03:58.320 --> 03:59.880
The leg's away, Jack!

04:04.800 --> 04:07.280
Yous two were laughing.
No, we werenae.

04:07.280 --> 04:10.440
Yes, you were. There was tears
rolling down your face.

04:10.440 --> 04:12.920
That was tears of grief.
Right, tears of grief.

04:12.920 --> 04:16.839
No, that was tears of pishing
yourself, that's what that was.

04:16.839 --> 04:19.800
Cos once you started,
that set him off.

04:19.800 --> 04:23.160
Grief's contagious. It's a terrible
thing, grief.

04:23.160 --> 04:25.160
And as for you, you tosser.

04:25.160 --> 04:26.480
You were bent double.

04:26.480 --> 04:28.760
I dropped my glasses.
Aye, so you did(!)

04:28.760 --> 04:31.040
All right, OK ,well, then.

04:32.680 --> 04:34.840
To Pete. ALL: To Pete!

04:37.000 --> 04:38.880
Maybe somebody should say something.

04:38.880 --> 04:42.040
Well, you just did, so...
No, substantial.

04:42.040 --> 04:43.840
From the heart. Oh, right.

04:43.840 --> 04:45.840
On the hoof. Off-the-cuff!

04:48.280 --> 04:51.440
Nice cuffage, Jack.
We all know why we're here today -

04:51.440 --> 04:53.240
to pay tribute to our friend,

04:53.240 --> 04:55.600
a Craiglang man through and through.

04:55.600 --> 04:58.400
Pete didn't have a home,
he was a man of no means.

04:58.400 --> 05:00.640
Not two pennies to rub together,

05:00.640 --> 05:04.920
the soles hanging off his shoes, and
not even a coat to keep him warm.

05:04.920 --> 05:08.840
But the one thing he always had,
ALWAYS had, was a smile.

05:08.840 --> 05:11.480
Even though he was
the poorest man we knew.

05:11.480 --> 05:14.440
GAMBLING MACHINE CASHES OUT

05:14.440 --> 05:18.120
Beautiful words, Jack!
Beautiful words.

05:21.840 --> 05:23.440
Jeez, it's quiet in here today.

05:31.880 --> 05:34.400
Isa. Hello, boys.

05:34.400 --> 05:36.600
Gentlemen. What can I do you for?

05:36.600 --> 05:39.000
Oh, just a bottle of the usual,
Navid.

05:43.160 --> 05:44.720
There you go.

05:48.760 --> 05:51.160
Ah, what? Price is up.

05:51.160 --> 05:52.880
Bloody budget.

05:52.880 --> 05:54.800
This is it, Jack.

05:54.800 --> 05:56.960
Aye, this is it, right enough.

05:56.960 --> 05:58.680
A long time ago, Navid,

05:58.680 --> 06:02.440
Jack and I agreed that when this
stuff got too dear,

06:02.440 --> 06:06.280
we were chucking it. And that,
my friend, is too dear.

06:06.280 --> 06:08.960
Well, boys, that is
the cheapest stuff.

06:08.960 --> 06:12.040
That is the gut rot,
the bottom of the barrel.

06:12.040 --> 06:14.640
I could charge more for a bottle of
Isa's sweat.

06:19.960 --> 06:22.440
Are you trying to get in or
trying to get out?

06:24.200 --> 06:25.920
I see no dilemma.

06:28.400 --> 06:31.160
Jack, Victor! What is it, Isa?

06:35.160 --> 06:37.240
Here, try this.

06:37.240 --> 06:39.040
What is that? Hooch.

06:39.040 --> 06:43.920
Potcheen. Home-made Wabawaba.
Ketanga. I don't know!

06:43.920 --> 06:47.240
Three quid a bottle's what it is.
Where the hell did you get that?

06:47.240 --> 06:50.560
Peggy's man got it off that boy
that swears all the time.

06:50.560 --> 06:53.440
Him with the turrets. And he got it
off that woman

06:53.440 --> 06:54.920
that looks like a fella.

06:54.920 --> 06:58.080
You know, her that changes
the tyres in the Scotfit.

06:58.080 --> 07:01.600
Who I think got it off
Piggy Patterson,

07:01.600 --> 07:05.400
him with the gastric band
that burst at the trampoline park.

07:05.400 --> 07:08.480
That's where the trail goes cold.
Take a nip!

07:24.520 --> 07:27.280
HE MUMBLES INCOHERENTLY

07:27.280 --> 07:28.320
What?

07:28.320 --> 07:30.480
HE MUMBLES INCOHERENTLY

07:30.480 --> 07:32.200
He says we don't like it!

07:34.800 --> 07:36.920
Bootleg hooch?

07:36.920 --> 07:39.320
It was like a kick in the balls.

07:39.320 --> 07:41.080
That would have been preferable!

07:41.080 --> 07:43.120
I've got bottle of that
in the house.

07:43.120 --> 07:47.200
The first gulp's a sore one, but
after that it's a smooth ride.

07:47.200 --> 07:49.600
You could clean your cooker with it,
it comes up lovely, tae.

07:49.600 --> 07:52.840
You for another?
Not at these prices, Boabby!

07:52.840 --> 07:57.080
I've telt you. Three half pints and
not another body in here.

07:57.080 --> 07:59.840
That is definitely it, I'm out.

07:59.840 --> 08:03.160
What you mean, you're out?
As of Monday, I'm chucking it.

08:03.160 --> 08:05.520
New fella Mark will be
standing here.

08:05.520 --> 08:07.200
You're leaving The Clansman?

08:07.200 --> 08:10.040
I didnae want to make a big deal
of it, but enough's enough.

08:10.040 --> 08:12.480
People are nae coming in cos of
the prices

08:12.480 --> 08:15.360
and you've got bootleg
garbage floating about.

08:15.360 --> 08:18.360
Nah. I'm done.

08:18.360 --> 08:20.600
But I'll no' be disappearing.

08:20.600 --> 08:23.400
I'll be in for a pint now and again.

08:23.400 --> 08:25.920
Anyway, finish up.

08:25.920 --> 08:28.200
You're no' going the noo, are you?

08:28.200 --> 08:30.360
No.

08:30.360 --> 08:32.360
I'm going down the bridge.

08:32.360 --> 08:34.600
Oh, now, don't be hasty, Boabby.

08:34.600 --> 08:37.120
No, I'm no' going to jump aff it!

08:37.120 --> 08:40.080
I'm going down to tidy up
where Pete slept.

08:40.080 --> 08:41.919
That's a nice thing.

08:41.919 --> 08:44.560
I'll come with you.
Are you two coming?

08:44.560 --> 08:47.080
No. We'd like to go with you,
but we're heading to Tam's.

08:47.080 --> 08:49.520
This is one kitty
he is not getting out of.

08:49.520 --> 08:52.440
Good luck with that. You should have
picked something simpler,

08:52.440 --> 08:55.440
like stealing the Coronation
necklace aff the Queen

08:55.440 --> 08:56.960
while she's taking a dump!

09:00.280 --> 09:03.400
Should phone the concierge.
Room service hasnae been in!

09:04.720 --> 09:07.680
Are you stealing this?
Aye, that's right, son.

09:07.680 --> 09:10.120
We're going to steal all this gear
and we're going to

09:10.120 --> 09:13.200
take it to Sotheby's. No, it's just
this belonged to my mate Pete.

09:13.200 --> 09:15.280
Oh, we know. He was our pal, too.

09:15.280 --> 09:17.280
That's why we're tidying up.

09:17.280 --> 09:20.280
I'm Mick. Methadone Mick.

09:20.280 --> 09:23.640
I'm Boabby. Barman Boabby.

09:25.320 --> 09:28.480
I'm...one-legged Winston?

09:28.480 --> 09:31.600
Aye, Pete's talked a lot about yous.

09:31.600 --> 09:33.240
This is for you. Oh.

09:33.240 --> 09:36.200
A ball class letter.
Scented, too.

09:40.600 --> 09:45.440
"To Boabby, only Boabby,
naebody but Boabby."

09:45.440 --> 09:48.960
That's got Boabby all over it.
That must be for you, Boabby!

09:51.560 --> 09:54.360
"If you're reading this, Boabby,
I'm already dead.

09:54.360 --> 09:56.280
"Nae more drink for me.

09:56.280 --> 09:57.520
"Bastard, hey?

09:58.760 --> 10:02.320
"If methadone Mick isnae dead, he's
just handed you this letter."

10:03.520 --> 10:04.560
I'm no' dead.

10:07.120 --> 10:10.360
"Although he looks like a skinny,
shiftless, nay-user,

10:10.360 --> 10:12.680
"he's nonetheless a good lad.

10:14.520 --> 10:16.640
"He will now hand you my estate,

10:16.640 --> 10:19.680
which you, Boabby,
are the executor of."

10:21.960 --> 10:26.000
These must be his worldly
possessions. Shush!

10:26.000 --> 10:28.440
"The details herein..."

10:28.440 --> 10:31.640
Heroin? No, "herein."

10:32.720 --> 10:36.720
"...must not be disclosed
until Friday 19th at 9am.

10:36.720 --> 10:38.800
"The venue shall be the Clansman.

10:39.920 --> 10:41.640
"Peto."

10:41.640 --> 10:43.520
PTO, please turn over. I know!

10:45.760 --> 10:50.360
"No doubt Mick will now have
his paw out expecting a bung.

10:50.360 --> 10:54.520
"Give him hee-haw, for he will only
try to buy crack

10:54.520 --> 10:56.600
"or some such with it.

10:56.600 --> 10:59.640
"All the best, Pete."

11:01.600 --> 11:04.560
It's cash, Tam.
Nothing other than cash.

11:04.560 --> 11:08.040
The thing is, it's Frances' and me's
anniversary this week and all my

11:08.040 --> 11:11.840
money's gone in that. Shut up.
£12!

11:11.840 --> 11:13.200
I've no' got it!

11:14.560 --> 11:15.960
What about this? Look.

11:15.960 --> 11:20.560
50 copies of the National Geographic
magazine. Beautiful photographs.

11:22.080 --> 11:26.200
Look, there's a polar bear
wiring into a seal! No.

11:30.720 --> 11:33.120
Football boots? You're not even
into football.

11:33.120 --> 11:36.760
I'm football daft!
These boots once belonged to...

11:36.760 --> 11:39.320
Patrick...Thistle.

11:39.320 --> 11:41.000
They're not even a pair.

11:42.080 --> 11:44.800
Listen, you. We don't want a
medicine ball,

11:44.800 --> 11:48.480
or a Bay City Rollers bedspread,
or a Kenny Rogers 8-track.

11:48.480 --> 11:51.280
Or a die-cast model
of JFK's Lincoln Continental

11:51.280 --> 11:54.440
moments before he was plugged
from the grassy knoll!

11:54.440 --> 11:55.960
We want 12 quid!

11:55.960 --> 11:58.360
What about this? A full complement

11:58.360 --> 12:02.000
of filthy, dirty porno cards
fae Santa Ponsa.

12:04.280 --> 12:06.400
They truly are manky.

12:06.400 --> 12:08.240
Especially...

12:08.240 --> 12:10.400
the nine of clubs.

12:15.280 --> 12:17.600
Slapping... 12 quid.

12:21.440 --> 12:22.840
What about this?

12:26.920 --> 12:28.760
Slippery bastard.

12:28.760 --> 12:31.000
What are we supposed to do with this
muck?

12:31.000 --> 12:32.880
Give our cookers a good clean.

12:32.880 --> 12:35.560
I think I made a mistake with them
nudie cards, you know.

12:35.560 --> 12:38.120
That nine of clubs looked like a
right carry-on, didn't she?

12:41.960 --> 12:44.240
What was it you said
your name was again?

12:44.240 --> 12:46.920
Mark. And you say we've never met?

12:46.920 --> 12:50.560
No, we havenae.
I cannae quite place you,

12:50.560 --> 12:53.400
but I'm definitely sure
I've spoke to you before.

12:53.400 --> 12:56.160
What pub did you work in
before this one?

12:56.160 --> 12:58.720
The Ginnel. The Ginnel?

12:58.720 --> 13:01.040
Tough shop. Not when I was on!

13:03.000 --> 13:05.760
The quiz night, we have met before!

13:07.520 --> 13:09.680
Well, if we have, I don't remember.

13:09.680 --> 13:12.160
And if I don't remember,
it didnae happen!

13:12.160 --> 13:13.880
All right, prick?

13:15.560 --> 13:17.920
Excuse me. What?

13:17.920 --> 13:20.720
Can I go to the toilet?
Away, you wee fanny!

13:22.480 --> 13:24.440
Boabby?

13:24.440 --> 13:26.400
I don't need the toilet!

13:26.400 --> 13:28.520
Where do you keep the scampi fries?

13:28.520 --> 13:31.280
Oh, in that box above the chest
freezer, Mark.

13:32.600 --> 13:34.480
Chest freezer?

13:34.480 --> 13:35.960
Handy thing, a chest freezer.

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
JACK AND VICTOR ENTER PUB CHATTING
Hey, Boabby!

13:41.000 --> 13:43.720
Is that you done now?
That's me a civilian.

13:43.720 --> 13:45.440
Ah, but you're still here!

13:45.440 --> 13:47.840
That's good. So nothing's really
changed, then?

13:47.840 --> 13:50.760
Well, I... Right, for old time's
sake, right,

13:50.760 --> 13:52.520
hit us with both barrels.

13:52.520 --> 13:56.080
What? Your patter, we'll take it off
you. It's a one-day-only offer.

13:57.080 --> 13:58.840
Look who it is.

13:58.840 --> 14:01.080
Waldorf and Statler.

14:01.080 --> 14:03.040
Very good, Boabby. Old Muppets.

14:03.040 --> 14:05.120
That must make you Kermit the Fud!

14:06.240 --> 14:08.480
Good one, Victor.
Two pints, prick!

14:08.480 --> 14:12.200
Hey. Don't talk to my customers
like that.

14:12.200 --> 14:13.640
Who's this whalloper?

14:16.640 --> 14:18.400
Hey? Oh, for...

14:23.320 --> 14:24.680
What? WINSTON: Hello, lads.

14:25.800 --> 14:27.680
ERIC: Whose round is it?

14:27.680 --> 14:29.800
ALL: I'm no' going.
Are ye aff yer nut?

14:32.400 --> 14:34.160
We are done.

14:34.160 --> 14:36.040
Right?

14:36.040 --> 14:38.560
What? The Clansman? Aye.
That big angry bear pulling

14:38.560 --> 14:41.960
your pint then looking for an excuse
to glass you with an empty tumbler?

14:41.960 --> 14:44.520
No. Aye, it's hardly Claridge's,
is it?

14:44.520 --> 14:46.080
"Pint?" "Yes, please."

14:46.080 --> 14:48.080
"What are you looking at?"
"Excuse me?"

14:48.080 --> 14:51.120
Tumbler, boof.
Royal. Face like Chucky!

14:52.240 --> 14:56.600
Oh, well. To me, you wee
home-fashioned strumpet!

14:56.600 --> 14:58.280
Whoa, give that to me!

14:58.280 --> 15:02.120
That's wino-ville, that's
skid row. Tin Pan Alley.

15:02.120 --> 15:03.840
That's music, Jack. Oh.

15:05.400 --> 15:07.320
Regardez vous.

15:09.120 --> 15:10.920
Oh. Hey?

15:10.920 --> 15:13.680
That Cillit Bang boy will be shiting
hissel'!

15:13.680 --> 15:16.320
Imagine what that could do
to your insides.

15:17.440 --> 15:19.920
What, make them all shiny?
What's that?

15:19.920 --> 15:22.520
KEYS JANGLE IN DOOR

15:26.240 --> 15:30.320
Isa? Jack? Victor.

15:30.320 --> 15:32.960
Oh, aye. Aye, Victor.

15:32.960 --> 15:34.600
What the hell are you doing?

15:35.600 --> 15:37.200
I've got my doors mixed up.

15:38.440 --> 15:40.880
I've stuck my thingmy
in your thingmy.

15:40.880 --> 15:44.600
Aye, you wish. I don't know
what's happening.

15:44.600 --> 15:46.400
It's a queer thing.

15:46.400 --> 15:49.080
I've never done that before -
I'm no' thinking.

15:49.080 --> 15:50.920
Isa, are you all right, hen?

15:50.920 --> 15:52.840
Aye, Oh, aye.

15:52.840 --> 15:57.360
Oh! I know that smell!

15:57.360 --> 16:00.040
It's that hoochie-coochie!

16:00.040 --> 16:03.040
I'll take one of them wee monkeys,
if there's one going!

16:03.040 --> 16:05.520
Chase yersel, Isa. Aye, come on.

16:07.480 --> 16:09.480
Keys.

16:09.480 --> 16:12.320
That's awful good of you, Jack,
helping me out.

16:12.320 --> 16:14.160
I don't know what's happened.

16:14.160 --> 16:16.080
It come on that sudden.

16:16.080 --> 16:19.400
I'll need to get down the optician's
and get my prescription changed.

16:20.800 --> 16:23.080
You'll be fine. You just need
some rest. Aye.

16:23.080 --> 16:26.080
Now, look, if you're needing
anything, anything at all,

16:26.080 --> 16:28.480
just give me a shout.
Anything at all, mind.

16:28.480 --> 16:30.960
Aye, you wouldn't mind coming in for
15 minutes

16:30.960 --> 16:33.760
and reading me a few pages
in my Take A Break?

16:33.760 --> 16:35.760
No.

16:44.440 --> 16:48.160
Eric. Who's that? What do you mean,
who's that?

16:48.160 --> 16:49.720
It's Jack and Victor. Oh.

16:49.720 --> 16:51.680
Hello, boys. What are you doing?

16:51.680 --> 16:54.360
What I always do on a Thursday.
Going down to the bookies.

17:00.120 --> 17:02.120
Aye, Boabby.

17:02.120 --> 17:06.480
Oh, Jack. Victor, didnae see you
there. We're glad we caught you.

17:06.480 --> 17:09.599
Can you not just get back behind the
bar again?

17:09.599 --> 17:13.040
Aye. Pull the old spurs back on,
get rid of that big, hairy balloon.

17:13.040 --> 17:15.000
I mean, The Clansman's a no-go zone.

17:15.000 --> 17:16.880
It's like the end of an era, son.

17:16.880 --> 17:19.160
No, it's the start of a new one.

17:19.160 --> 17:21.640
The era of me suiting myself.

17:21.640 --> 17:24.760
I sleep to when I like,
go to the bookies,

17:24.760 --> 17:27.920
couple of halves in the afternoon.
Columbo. Magic.

17:27.920 --> 17:31.360
If I'd have known being an old prick
was this much fun,

17:31.360 --> 17:32.920
I'd have chucked it years ago!

17:32.920 --> 17:34.520
Ah, well, you're not an old prick.

17:34.520 --> 17:36.920
You're a young prick!
We need you back.

17:36.920 --> 17:39.080
Nah, I'm done.

17:39.080 --> 17:41.960
Clansman's done. Who needs it?

17:41.960 --> 17:44.560
Not when you've got this.

17:45.920 --> 17:47.680
The wacky water.

17:47.680 --> 17:49.320
Boabby.

17:49.320 --> 17:51.960
Gamekeeper turned poacher, lads.

17:51.960 --> 17:53.880
I know the path I'm on.

17:53.880 --> 17:55.840
And for the first time in years...

17:57.320 --> 17:58.840
...I'm enjoying the journey.

18:00.720 --> 18:02.480
Sorry, missus.

18:19.080 --> 18:22.040
Tam? Oh, hello, lads.

18:22.040 --> 18:24.160
What are you up to?
Well, I was just...

18:24.160 --> 18:26.560
Sh. What are you up to?

18:26.560 --> 18:30.200
I was just dropping off a bottle of
the la-la lotion for Winston there.

18:30.200 --> 18:32.760
Where are you getting this stuff?
Well, it's everywhere,

18:32.760 --> 18:35.760
everybody's got it.
Aye, but where did YOU get it?

18:35.760 --> 18:39.640
Eric gave me it. Eric's making it?
No, that's the thing.

18:39.640 --> 18:41.920
Nobody knows. It just keeps
turning up.

18:43.200 --> 18:45.160
I don't touch it myself, obviously.

18:45.160 --> 18:47.920
You don't touch it? I'm a lager man.

18:47.920 --> 18:49.480
Let's just see, shall we?

18:52.840 --> 18:56.240
Read that headline.
"Booze tax still biting."

18:56.240 --> 18:58.000
Not the big one, the wee one.

18:58.000 --> 18:59.680
All right.

18:59.680 --> 19:02.600
"Kerry Katona badly burned
in midnight chip pan horror."

19:03.840 --> 19:05.520
That's right.

19:05.520 --> 19:08.560
That me? Got a busy anniversary
night ahead, you know?

19:08.560 --> 19:10.480
Knife, fork, hole.

19:11.880 --> 19:14.560
That's us. Goodnight, lads.

19:18.760 --> 19:20.080
< It's open!

19:25.440 --> 19:28.280
Lads, what can I get yous?

19:28.280 --> 19:31.600
How's your eyesight?
Actually, not the greatest.

19:31.600 --> 19:34.920
It started off with a crossword.
I couldnae make it out.

19:34.920 --> 19:37.360
I'm not on tablets or anything,
you know?

19:37.360 --> 19:39.480
I've no headaches,
I'm sleeping great,

19:39.480 --> 19:42.600
I'm just racking my brain,
trying for the life of me

19:42.600 --> 19:44.400
to work out what it could be.

19:47.400 --> 19:49.440
Old age, I suppose.

19:49.440 --> 19:52.320
It's that stuff. Eh? That's Satan's
Sauce you're drinking.

19:52.320 --> 19:55.480
It's all over the estate.
Nobody can see properly.

19:55.480 --> 19:59.080
You're joking!
That's unbelievable, that.

19:59.080 --> 20:01.280
Terrible. Whoa, whoa!

20:01.280 --> 20:03.160
Give that to me.

20:03.160 --> 20:06.480
Isa, Eric, Boabby, now you.

20:06.480 --> 20:07.960
Everyone's affected.

20:09.040 --> 20:10.480
Well, not everybody. How?

20:10.480 --> 20:14.000
Well, there's nothing the matter
with Tam's eyesight, is there?

20:15.400 --> 20:17.920
BOTH: Bastard! He's making it.

20:17.920 --> 20:19.440
He doesn't touch it, he said.

20:19.440 --> 20:22.400
Never get high on your own supply,
that's what they say, isn't it?

20:22.400 --> 20:25.160
What are we going to do?
Smash up the operation.

20:25.160 --> 20:26.920
Aye, brilliant.

20:26.920 --> 20:29.560
I'll get my jacket. No, you're not
going anywhere.

20:29.560 --> 20:32.000
How no'? Because you're blind as
a bat, that's how.

20:32.000 --> 20:34.080
Me, blind as a bat?

20:34.080 --> 20:35.840
That's ridiculous.

20:35.840 --> 20:37.880
I've never heard anything so absurd.

20:37.880 --> 20:39.520
I can see perfectly.

20:39.520 --> 20:41.720
I can see that pin over there.

20:41.720 --> 20:44.480
Would that satisfy you?
What pin? Where?

20:59.160 --> 21:01.400
You see that sideboard over there,
Winston?

21:01.400 --> 21:03.400
Yes, of course.

21:03.400 --> 21:05.000
Place the pin down there, would you?

21:10.760 --> 21:12.400
Sit down.

21:14.800 --> 21:18.040
I cannae see nothing. I went for a
slash about an hour ago

21:18.040 --> 21:20.960
and I opened my belt. I pointed the
buckle at the pan

21:20.960 --> 21:23.440
and pished all down the leg
of my trousers.

21:41.120 --> 21:44.320
TAM SINGS TO HIMSELF

22:12.360 --> 22:15.520
Stick your head up again and get
a right good look.

22:17.800 --> 22:20.920
How's it to be my head? My head's
much bigger than your head.

22:20.920 --> 22:24.480
He'll see my head right away.
No, no, no. My head's much bigger

22:24.480 --> 22:28.080
than your head. I've got to hunt
like Taggart just to buy a hat.

22:28.080 --> 22:31.240
We're not talking girth, Jack.
We're talking forehead height.

22:31.240 --> 22:34.040
I've got a massive forehead. It's
actually a sign of intelligence,

22:34.040 --> 22:37.240
but that doesnae matter. Your
forehead is smaller, it's like a...

22:37.240 --> 22:39.000
like a...grapefruit.

22:39.000 --> 22:41.880
Grapefruit? I'll segment your balls.

22:41.880 --> 22:43.600
Get him spied on!

22:54.040 --> 22:57.520
We've got him bang to rights.
He's our man.

22:57.520 --> 22:59.520
He's making hooch. Are you sure?

22:59.520 --> 23:02.280
He's distilling hooch
in his own kitchen.

23:02.280 --> 23:03.560
What are we going to do here?

23:03.560 --> 23:06.640
People are losing their eyesight
because of this muck.

23:06.640 --> 23:09.280
We need to do what they done
in the 1920s.

23:09.280 --> 23:11.600
Prohibition, Eliot Ness.

23:11.600 --> 23:15.080
The Untouchables.
Put him out of business.

23:17.080 --> 23:21.040
Jack Travis, concerned Craiglang
pensioner! Times two!

23:50.920 --> 23:52.880
Was that your dinner?

23:55.720 --> 23:58.840
What was it? Stew or something?

23:58.840 --> 24:01.480
Beef bourguignon.
It's Frances's favourite.

24:03.000 --> 24:05.800
What the bloody hell do you think
yous are doing?!

24:05.800 --> 24:08.840
You were making hooch,
so we smashed up your still.

24:08.840 --> 24:10.680
It's a pressure cooker.

24:10.680 --> 24:12.840
For cooking a meal.

24:14.080 --> 24:15.520
It's our second anniversary.

24:17.360 --> 24:19.600
Happy anniversary.
Happy anniversary.

24:19.600 --> 24:21.960
Yous have went to a lot of bother,
boys.

24:21.960 --> 24:24.000
But a card would have covered it.

24:25.440 --> 24:27.160
CROCKERY FALLS AND SMASHES

24:35.200 --> 24:36.440
Right.

24:36.440 --> 24:38.120
4-3, double two.

24:38.120 --> 24:39.160
Very good.

24:40.240 --> 24:42.840
Blank and a four. Excellent.

24:42.840 --> 24:45.440
I've not touched the gaga juice
for four days.

24:45.440 --> 24:47.640
Good. Keep it that way.

24:47.640 --> 24:50.800
OK. As per Pete's request,

24:50.800 --> 24:55.600
we're here at The Clansman
at 9am on the 19th.

24:55.600 --> 24:57.400
How did you get in here, Boabby?

25:00.840 --> 25:04.240
Oh, smashing. Can I get a set of
them cut? Shut up.

25:11.040 --> 25:13.240
"Hello. Thank you for coming.

25:13.240 --> 25:16.960
"Please find enclosed something
for each of you

25:16.960 --> 25:18.880
"as a token of my respect.

25:18.880 --> 25:21.520
"Boabby...

25:21.520 --> 25:23.600
"Call this number.

25:23.600 --> 25:25.640
"0141 336..."

25:25.640 --> 25:27.880
A phone number. Thanks, Pete!

25:27.880 --> 25:29.400
Well, phone it, Boabby.

25:29.400 --> 25:31.040
Aye.

25:31.040 --> 25:32.880
Winston, do the honours.

25:32.880 --> 25:35.920
It just can't get
any more exciting(!)

25:35.920 --> 25:39.440
Right, who's first? Winston.

25:39.440 --> 25:40.880
Me.

25:40.880 --> 25:44.800
"I was walking past Clarks, I saw
this and thought of you.

25:44.800 --> 25:46.160
"Best foot forward."

25:47.840 --> 25:49.280
One shoe!

25:49.280 --> 25:51.560
Right, who's next? Navid.

25:55.480 --> 25:58.840
19 quid. Wow, that's exactly
what he owed me.

25:58.840 --> 26:00.800
That was his tick. Classy.

26:02.040 --> 26:03.360
Tam.

26:04.400 --> 26:05.440
A teabag?

26:06.840 --> 26:09.240
"Have a drink on me...

26:09.240 --> 26:11.080
"you miserable bastard."

26:12.840 --> 26:14.480
Isa.

26:14.480 --> 26:17.760
One set of pink panties with
a lion rampant on the front.

26:17.760 --> 26:19.720
Scotland World Cup, '78.

26:19.720 --> 26:22.080
Panties? That's a strange gift.

26:22.080 --> 26:25.320
That's not a gift. That was some
party, wasn't it, Isa?

26:25.320 --> 26:27.160
Pete's returning them!

26:29.240 --> 26:31.280
Thanks. Goodbye.

26:33.560 --> 26:35.400
What is it, Boabby?

26:35.400 --> 26:39.080
Pete put me forward for the Glasgow
Good Citizens civic medal.

26:40.800 --> 26:43.040
And they've given it to me.

26:43.040 --> 26:46.080
How are you, nae offence,
a whallopper

26:46.080 --> 26:48.040
getting a thing like that?

26:49.000 --> 26:52.320
Well, I used to open up
early for him...

26:53.720 --> 26:56.120
...and do a fry-up,
make him a mug of tea.

26:56.120 --> 26:59.400
It set him on an even keel.

26:59.400 --> 27:02.360
Every Friday? Every morning.

27:07.680 --> 27:09.160
Right.

27:10.960 --> 27:13.680
What are yous having?
Can I get Pete's fry-up?

27:14.960 --> 27:17.600
Listen, what about that big, hairy
Bluto bastard, Boabby?

27:20.200 --> 27:21.560
Is this The Clansman?

27:21.560 --> 27:24.800
HIGH-PITCHED VOICE:
No, The Clansman's next door.

27:24.800 --> 27:27.880
You're in Navid's. Am I?

27:27.880 --> 27:32.280
IMITATES NAVID: Meena, this floor
needs mopped.

27:32.280 --> 27:34.400
ISA SPEAKS URDU

27:36.800 --> 27:39.920
I'm going to tell Boabby I'm having
to hand my notice in.

27:39.920 --> 27:42.040
I'm having trouble with my eyesight.

27:54.080 --> 27:56.840
Anything in that bag for us,
Winston?

27:56.840 --> 27:59.320
Aye, it's a note to the pair of you.

28:02.520 --> 28:06.680
"Dear Jack and Victor, or may I say
the ambassadors of Craiglang.

28:06.680 --> 28:10.000
"Two good friends who always
looked after each other.

28:10.000 --> 28:14.000
"Now from the pub that never closes
in the sky, I'll look after you.

28:15.360 --> 28:18.560
"I give to yous my most treasured
possessions.

28:18.560 --> 28:21.720
"Enjoy, the very best, and I'll see
you on the other side."

28:21.720 --> 28:23.800
See you on the other side?

28:25.880 --> 28:28.760
Not with this shite,

28:55.640 --> 28:58.880
NAVID: I don't get it. Why's naebody
buying our hooch any more?
