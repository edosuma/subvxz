WEBVTT

00:00.182 --> 00:01.181
<i> No, no, no,</i>
<i>you're gonna love this place.</i>

00:01.267 --> 00:04.064
It's not Brazilian,
it's Portuguese.

00:04.184 --> 00:05.183
What's the difference?

00:05.235 --> 00:06.518
There's no cassava.

00:06.603 --> 00:08.353
Guys, you're gonna love it.
All right...

00:08.405 --> 00:09.604
I'm...

00:09.690 --> 00:12.074
I believe I have the
6:30 to 7:30 shift.

00:12.159 --> 00:14.526
You do. Andre, it's time to go.

00:14.578 --> 00:16.361
Have you guys met?
Pete, this is Andre.

00:16.447 --> 00:18.624
He's putting his weird little
wizzle into your ex-wife.

00:18.700 --> 00:19.815
You know what?
It's fine.

00:19.901 --> 00:21.784
I'm gonna leave.
I have a date anyway with...

00:21.819 --> 00:23.452
Uh-uh, dah, dah, dah.
Well, can I at least just tell you

00:23.488 --> 00:24.904
that it's a pop-up
restaurant celebrating cumin?

00:24.989 --> 00:26.289
No. No, no, you cannot.
Okay, well, it is.

00:26.324 --> 00:27.290
Thank you.

00:27.325 --> 00:28.658
Can we please make sure

00:28.743 --> 00:30.584
that person is gone
before I arrive? Thank you.

00:30.662 --> 00:32.161
I will try,
but, I mean, it's August.

00:32.246 --> 00:34.080
How long is this thing
gonna go on for?

00:34.165 --> 00:35.631
Pete, Ndamukong Suh
is on the Dolphins.

00:35.667 --> 00:37.166
Jimmy Graham is on the Seahawks.

00:37.251 --> 00:40.169
Meegan is on the Andres.
Don't want to hear it.

00:40.254 --> 00:42.305
Maybe you're just upset that
she's upgraded at the position.

00:42.340 --> 00:44.223
No, I'm upset because this whole
thing makes me look bad, okay?

00:44.309 --> 00:46.008
Years ago,

00:46.060 --> 00:48.594
I climbed Mount Meegan
when that meant something.

00:48.680 --> 00:50.980
But now, apparently,
anyone with an Ed Hardy parka

00:51.015 --> 00:54.684
and, like, DeLeón Tequila
carabiners can just mount her?

00:54.769 --> 00:57.737
Well, maybe it's just that you
and Andre are Meegan's type.

00:57.822 --> 00:59.855
That's my problem.
Her being interested in him

00:59.907 --> 01:01.941
makes me retroactively douchey.

01:02.026 --> 01:03.693
No. No.
No. Peter, you are <i>actively</i> douchey.

01:03.745 --> 01:05.093
Yeah,<i> proactively.</i>

01:05.214 --> 01:10.748
<font color="#ec14bd">Sync & corrections by honeybunny</font>
<font color="#ec14bd">www.addic7ed.com</font>

01:10.868 --> 01:12.785
Coming in hot.
Gorgeous.

01:12.870 --> 01:14.203
All right, now
that we got food,

01:14.255 --> 01:16.293
it is time to pick
the draft order.

01:16.413 --> 01:19.091
Let's do this!
Hey, Russell, how you been, man?

01:19.177 --> 01:20.710
How's that sex addiction
treating you?

01:20.795 --> 01:22.011
Just trying to take it
one day at a time,

01:22.046 --> 01:23.295
which is all I can do.

01:23.381 --> 01:24.880
That and, of course, stay away

01:24.932 --> 01:27.183
from cheese, especially
Manchego, that... temptress.

01:27.218 --> 01:28.968
Let's get back

01:29.053 --> 01:30.186
to the draft order, please.

01:30.221 --> 01:32.521
Your champion... has arrived!

01:32.557 --> 01:34.140
Please put away
that unsightly helmet.

01:34.225 --> 01:35.641
This year, we'll be

01:35.727 --> 01:37.610
choosing our order
from one of my

01:37.695 --> 01:39.028
lucky fedoras.

01:39.063 --> 01:40.503
Kevin, tell Andre
we don't need a hat

01:40.565 --> 01:41.647
and that I will be
drafting first

01:41.733 --> 01:43.065
because you all lied to me.

01:43.151 --> 01:44.567
Kevin, can you
please tell Peter

01:44.619 --> 01:46.786
that I did not lie to him about
my relationship with Meegan.

01:46.871 --> 01:50.039
And my relationship has nothing
to do with our draft order.

01:50.074 --> 01:51.675
Ruxin, would you ask Andre
to forgive me?

01:51.709 --> 01:54.229
I have a hard time trusting him
when he put a knife in my heart.

01:54.245 --> 01:55.494
Andre, Pete says

01:55.580 --> 01:57.046
that that sweatshirt vest
makes you look

01:57.081 --> 01:58.247
like a moderately successful

01:58.299 --> 01:59.749
Vine star.

01:59.801 --> 02:01.250
Ruxin, please tell Peter

02:01.302 --> 02:03.302
that a moderately successful
Vine star is still a force

02:03.388 --> 02:05.588
to be reckoned with
in this new social media world.

02:05.640 --> 02:07.139
No.
Okay, Jenny, will you explain the...?

02:07.225 --> 02:08.556
No.
Kev...

02:08.592 --> 02:09.514
What do you think, bro?

02:09.560 --> 02:10.476
Okay, how about this?

02:10.561 --> 02:11.727
Will you sing a battle rap?

02:11.763 --> 02:13.095
You're smarter than that, Andre.

02:13.181 --> 02:14.647
Put your phone away.
It'll be like you're in <i> 8 Mile.</i>

02:14.732 --> 02:16.649
- Hey, guys.
- Thank you, Taco.

02:16.734 --> 02:18.734
I appreciate it very much.

02:18.770 --> 02:20.403
Andre, can you tell Pete
that choosing

02:20.438 --> 02:21.687
him over Andre
was a no-brainer?

02:21.773 --> 02:23.906
Works for me.

02:23.941 --> 02:25.908
This year I
want to propose a few

02:25.943 --> 02:28.360
rule changes. We talked about
doing an auction-style draft.

02:28.446 --> 02:30.279
- Correct? Everyone's into that?
- Yes.

02:30.364 --> 02:31.280
Yeah, let's do it.
Yeah. Good.

02:31.332 --> 02:32.782
And the draft is September 5.

02:32.867 --> 02:34.387
Mark your calendars,
because this year,

02:34.419 --> 02:36.452
we're going back

02:36.504 --> 02:39.288
in time to the 1890s to

02:39.373 --> 02:40.923
the Gilded Age!

02:40.958 --> 02:42.007
Ugh.
Ugh. No.

02:42.093 --> 02:43.375
Theme draft?

02:43.461 --> 02:46.462
And everyone must come
in appropriate attire.

02:46.547 --> 02:47.763
No.
Costumes?

02:47.799 --> 02:49.965
I love the '90s.
I'm gonna go as Kurt Cobain.

02:50.051 --> 02:52.134
No, no.<i> 1890s.</i>

02:52.220 --> 02:53.886
You know, the draft is
my favorite day of the year,

02:53.971 --> 02:55.387
and now I don't even want
to attend.

02:55.473 --> 02:56.889
Ruxin, would you please
tell Andre

02:56.974 --> 02:58.474
he's the Grinch
of fantasy football?

02:58.526 --> 03:00.142
Andre, Pete says that you are

03:00.228 --> 03:03.646
the metrosexual plastic
surgeon who stole draft day.

03:03.731 --> 03:06.031
I assume you <i> all</i> will be there, though.
Oh, no.

03:06.117 --> 03:07.867
I'm gonna have to do
it over speakerphone.

03:07.952 --> 03:09.485
I would love to spend
15 rounds with you guys

03:09.537 --> 03:12.121
in period costumes,
but I'm supposed to go

03:12.156 --> 03:13.957
to Wisconsin that weekend
to see some friends.

03:13.958 --> 03:16.459
Wisconsin? A lot
of cheese there, huh?

03:16.494 --> 03:18.494
Is there? I-I wouldn't know.

03:18.579 --> 03:19.745
There's a whole week there

03:19.831 --> 03:21.881
called Cheese-a-Palooza,
I believe.

03:21.966 --> 03:23.549
Is that a real event? Because
no one told me about that.

03:23.634 --> 03:25.000
I don't understand.

03:25.086 --> 03:27.169
You specifically told me you
were going tor Cheese-a-Palooza.

03:27.255 --> 03:29.338
Shut your mouth, Taco.

03:31.559 --> 03:33.259
<i>This whole thing
makes no sense.</i>

03:33.344 --> 03:34.810
<i>How is she with him?</i>

03:34.846 --> 03:37.012
How does she not know
the Andre we know?

03:37.064 --> 03:38.848
The same one who video blogs
about Don Henley and magic...

03:38.900 --> 03:41.183
Oh.
...and gets his arm stuck in toilets and

03:41.269 --> 03:43.149
ends up in an abusive
relationship with his cat.

03:43.154 --> 03:44.603
Don't worry about it. She's
gonna find all that out.

03:44.689 --> 03:46.021
I'm... Well, I...
Gentlemen,

03:46.073 --> 03:48.324
as you know, I've been
incubating my next big idea

03:48.359 --> 03:49.525
in my Taco Tank.

03:49.610 --> 03:51.443
You mean hot boxing
in a storage container?

03:51.529 --> 03:53.162
After careful study of eating,

03:53.197 --> 03:56.365
Taco Tank has discovered that
over the past few centuries,

03:56.417 --> 03:59.034
there have been many
advances in food technology.

03:59.120 --> 04:01.003
However, there have
been very few advances

04:01.038 --> 04:03.088
in napkin technology.

04:03.174 --> 04:04.540
Oh, I thought
this was gonna be stupid.

04:04.592 --> 04:07.209
Introducing...
the napkin glove.

04:07.295 --> 04:08.711
Put it on when
you're having a meal.

04:08.763 --> 04:09.929
And what's that?

04:10.014 --> 04:11.547
You got a little spaghetti sauce
on your mouth?

04:11.599 --> 04:13.716
No problem.

04:13.768 --> 04:15.885
Tada! All clean.

04:15.937 --> 04:17.720
Pathetic patent pending.
But that's not all.

04:17.772 --> 04:21.140
It comes in a variety
of styles and colors.

04:21.225 --> 04:23.309
Great work, Steve No Jobs.

04:23.394 --> 04:24.894
So, Kevin, are you busy tonight?
You want to do something?

04:24.979 --> 04:28.614
I can't tonight. I have
a school fund-raiser.

04:28.699 --> 04:30.399
Cheers.

04:30.451 --> 04:32.368
To our first couples dinner.

04:32.403 --> 04:34.703
Cheers. Cheers, everybody.

04:34.739 --> 04:36.488
Amazing. I think I have to do
a toast to our first toast.

04:36.574 --> 04:38.541
Yeah, I can do...
toast to our first toast.

04:38.576 --> 04:40.125
- Cheers!
- Cheers.

04:40.211 --> 04:42.211
Did you talk to Pete
about tonight?

04:42.246 --> 04:43.879
No. This night never happened.

04:43.915 --> 04:45.414
I <i> wish</i> this night
never happened.

04:45.466 --> 04:47.426
I told him we were
at a parent-teacher conference.

04:47.468 --> 04:49.468
I told him we were at a fund-raiser.
Why would you tell him that?

04:49.554 --> 04:51.303
Because I want him to
think we have money.

04:51.389 --> 04:53.839
Meegan, it makes me
so happy to see you happy.

04:53.925 --> 04:55.140
Yes.
Oh, thank you. You know what?

04:55.226 --> 04:56.809
I really am.
I am. We just have

04:56.894 --> 04:58.844
so much in common. We both...
I know.

04:58.930 --> 05:00.596
...love costumes.
Oh, my gosh.

05:00.648 --> 05:02.648
We love theme nights,
and we love...

05:02.733 --> 05:04.400
- Accents.
- Oh.

05:04.435 --> 05:06.018
Oh.
Oh, we're super good at it.

05:06.103 --> 05:08.437
She puts my Cockney to shame.

05:08.489 --> 05:10.189
It's not the only
place she puts it.

05:10.274 --> 05:11.824
Actually, you guys,

05:11.909 --> 05:13.492
the thing that I love most...
Mm-hmm.

05:13.578 --> 05:14.827
...about this guy...

05:14.912 --> 05:16.195
His multiple malpractice suits?

05:16.280 --> 05:17.401
We're both sapiosexual.
Yeah.

05:17.415 --> 05:18.530
Sapiosexual.

05:18.616 --> 05:20.115
I'm sorry.
What's that?

05:20.201 --> 05:21.283
Oh, it's when one
partner likes to stick

05:21.335 --> 05:22.495
their finger...
No. No, no no.

05:22.536 --> 05:23.953
That's what I thought it was.

05:24.038 --> 05:26.839
Sapiosexual means
that the most attractive feature

05:26.924 --> 05:30.259
that we find in each other
is our intelligence.

05:30.294 --> 05:33.429
Mmm... boom.

05:33.464 --> 05:36.599
Is it possible that she has
made Andre more annoying?

05:36.634 --> 05:38.467
I think it is.

05:38.519 --> 05:40.686
- Yes. Boom!
- Hey, guys, guys?

05:40.771 --> 05:43.055
A little fearless feedback--
it's not gonna work.

05:43.140 --> 05:44.690
No.
Yeah, not with you two.

05:44.775 --> 05:46.108
- What? 
- Yeah.

05:46.143 --> 05:47.943
Bread for the table?
Oh.

05:47.979 --> 05:49.778
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

05:49.814 --> 05:51.694
You're never gonna lose
weight eating like that.

05:51.699 --> 05:53.032
Ruxin, what's wrong?
No bread?

05:53.117 --> 05:55.284
He's just a little <i>gordito.</i>

05:55.319 --> 05:57.236
We can't see
his wee-wee.

05:57.321 --> 05:58.654
- We can see it.
- So,

05:58.739 --> 06:01.073
are you guys excited?
Because it's almost draft time!

06:01.158 --> 06:02.458
What, what, what?!

06:02.493 --> 06:05.160
I can't believe that you are
into fantasy football now.

06:05.246 --> 06:07.079
So into it.
That's crazy.

06:07.164 --> 06:08.714
Sofia, you've got to do it.

06:08.799 --> 06:10.749
Really?
Yes. Nah.

06:10.835 --> 06:12.167
Oh, my God, it's so much fun!

06:12.219 --> 06:13.802
What do you think?
Nah.

06:13.838 --> 06:15.587
Guys, couples league.

06:15.673 --> 06:17.339
- Aah.
- Yes!

06:17.425 --> 06:19.174
That would be so fun!

06:19.260 --> 06:20.342
- Aah!
- My lady

06:20.394 --> 06:22.011
kills it in fantasy.
Oh.

06:22.096 --> 06:23.679
Honey, drop some knowledge
on them.

06:23.764 --> 06:26.432
I think that you guys are insane
to go running back,

06:26.517 --> 06:27.683
<i>running back</i> with your

06:27.735 --> 06:29.018
first two picks.

06:29.070 --> 06:31.353
What I would suggest
doing is going

06:31.439 --> 06:33.355
wide receiver, wide receiver.

06:33.441 --> 06:35.157
Where was that shit
seven years ago?

06:35.192 --> 06:36.659
You should check
out her mock drafts.

06:36.694 --> 06:38.077
- She's killing it.
- You know, Meegan,

06:38.162 --> 06:40.696
Andre was telling us about
his plans for the draft.

06:40.781 --> 06:42.781
We didn't realize you two
were so into the Gilded Age.

06:42.867 --> 06:44.083
Ah.

06:44.168 --> 06:46.201
The Gilded Age.
Age.

06:46.253 --> 06:47.786
We just love it!

06:47.872 --> 06:49.312
Oh, and you know
what? Andre has been

06:49.340 --> 06:51.206
studying the ancient art
of bartitsu.

06:51.292 --> 06:52.458
Bartitsu.

06:52.543 --> 06:54.023
I can't put my finger
on the language,

06:54.045 --> 06:56.545
but I believe it means
"ultimate sadness."

06:56.630 --> 06:58.547
More like
"ultimate gentlemen fighting."

06:58.632 --> 07:01.100
See, it's the Victorian art
of self-defense.

07:01.185 --> 07:03.519
And a true gentlemen
must be able to defend himself

07:03.554 --> 07:06.055
only with the items
on his person.

07:06.107 --> 07:07.606
Be they...
A cane.

07:07.692 --> 07:09.058
Be they...
A parasol.

07:09.110 --> 07:10.943
- Be they...
- A snuffbox.

07:11.028 --> 07:12.027
So it's like kung fool.

07:12.063 --> 07:13.729
Or tae kwon douche.

07:13.814 --> 07:16.031
Ooh, dinner is served.
A toast to our first dinn...

07:16.067 --> 07:18.233
Oh.
No. No, no. No, no.

07:18.319 --> 07:19.985
Fresh ground pepper, sir?

07:20.071 --> 07:22.621
Uh, yes, please.
Say when.

07:22.707 --> 07:24.990
You know what? Why don't
you just leave it here?

07:25.076 --> 07:26.241
I can't do that,
sir, but I'd be happy

07:26.293 --> 07:27.409
to give you as
much as you'd like.

07:27.495 --> 07:28.911
Well, I might want more later,

07:28.996 --> 07:31.080
so how about you just leave
the grinder on the table,

07:31.165 --> 07:32.631
and I'll just use it at my whim?

07:32.717 --> 07:34.216
Oh, if you want more
pepper later, you can use

07:34.251 --> 07:35.751
the pepper that's on the table.
That's what it's there for.

07:35.803 --> 07:37.970
That's the trash pepper, and
that's why it's on the table.

07:38.055 --> 07:39.421
You got the good stuff,
and I want to be

07:39.473 --> 07:40.639
in control of the good stuff.

07:40.725 --> 07:42.508
Well, I can't leave
it here. I'm sorry.

07:42.593 --> 07:44.593
Honey, I think you've had enough pepper.
Quiet.

07:44.678 --> 07:46.929
I see that waitress right there.
She's grating cheese.

07:47.014 --> 07:48.263
Am I gonna have to go through
the same rigmarole

07:48.349 --> 07:49.765
when I want some cheese?

07:49.817 --> 07:51.100
With all due respect, sir,

07:51.185 --> 07:53.185
going to a restaurant
is itself a rigmarole.

07:53.270 --> 07:55.310
If you don't want the pomp
and circumstance of being

07:55.322 --> 07:57.072
served by professional
wait staff, you can go home

07:57.108 --> 07:59.408
and eat cat food over the toilet
for all I care,

07:59.443 --> 08:01.323
but while you're here,
I will grind your pepper.

08:02.530 --> 08:04.613
You know what, I've overreacted.

08:04.665 --> 08:07.449
You're the king of the grinder.

08:07.501 --> 08:08.784
I'd like a little more, please.

08:08.869 --> 08:10.119
Say when, sir.

08:12.123 --> 08:13.705
No!

08:13.791 --> 08:15.632
I say when. I say when.
I say when. I say when.

08:15.709 --> 08:17.843
I say when! I say when!
I say when! I say when!

08:25.778 --> 08:28.571
Would anyone else like any fresh
ground pepper on their entree?

08:28.795 --> 08:30.353
No.

08:31.183 --> 08:32.432
That waiter was a psychopath, the way
Oh, my God.

08:32.517 --> 08:34.363
he kept staring at us all night.

08:34.482 --> 08:36.316
I wanted pepper on everything,

08:36.368 --> 08:38.044
and I was too afraid to
ask him for...

08:38.164 --> 08:39.539
Oh, my God!
Me, too. Oh, my God!

08:39.863 --> 08:42.893
Sorry to scare you.
It's just me, the seventh wheel.

08:43.013 --> 08:45.582
Pete...
No... No, Pete.

08:45.702 --> 08:47.118
That's not true. No?
No.

08:47.203 --> 08:48.119
Where you been?

08:48.204 --> 08:49.537
We were...
we were on a date.

08:49.589 --> 08:50.872
We were dating.

08:50.924 --> 08:52.290
Oh, really?
'Cause I thought it was...

08:52.375 --> 08:53.374
a parent-teacher conference.

08:53.426 --> 08:55.510
Or maybe
a fund-raiser.

08:55.545 --> 08:57.211
I mean, come on, Kevin, you
don't have that kind of money.

08:57.263 --> 08:59.514
How could you go
to dinner with them?

08:59.549 --> 09:01.349
What's your excuse? Let me
hear it. It better be good.

09:01.384 --> 09:03.718
Well, they invited us.
I was just hungry.

09:03.803 --> 09:05.853
You just bought yourselves two
one-way tickets off Team Pete.

09:05.889 --> 09:07.055
Now go to your room.

09:07.107 --> 09:09.607
What? What, you're
just gonna hang out here?

09:09.693 --> 09:11.059
Well,<i> SportCenter's</i> on.
He said go

09:11.144 --> 09:11.859
to your room!
Oh, my God!

09:11.895 --> 09:12.944
And when Tall Guy says,

09:13.029 --> 09:13.861
"Go to your room,"
you go to your room.

09:13.897 --> 09:15.029
You're in trouble.

09:15.065 --> 09:16.197
What are you doing here, Rafi?

09:16.232 --> 09:17.482
Um, just hanging out

09:17.567 --> 09:19.534
behind the couch, like normal.

09:19.569 --> 09:22.870
But I'm also mad, because I
wasn't invited to dinner either.

09:22.906 --> 09:24.572
Rafi, it was a couples dinner.

09:24.657 --> 09:26.290
So? I could've brought
my very serious girlfriend.

09:26.376 --> 09:27.325
What?
Who?

09:27.410 --> 09:29.243
Have you guys not met Margaret?

09:29.295 --> 09:30.328
Oh, my God.

09:30.413 --> 09:32.246
It's very serious.

09:32.298 --> 09:34.248
But is it consensual?

09:34.334 --> 09:35.833
This was.

09:35.919 --> 09:38.052
- This wasn't.
- Oh, God.

09:38.088 --> 09:39.971
Okay. Let's go to bed.
You know what, let's all go to bed.

09:40.056 --> 09:40.886
All go in the room.

09:41.006 --> 09:42.630
We talked about it afterwards,
and she said it felt good.

09:43.059 --> 09:46.427
They loved you.

09:49.265 --> 09:50.431
Ooh.

09:53.403 --> 09:56.437
"Andre and Meegan invite you
to the Draft of Innocence"?

09:56.523 --> 09:59.190
"Prepare yourself
for an Oscar Wilde night.

09:59.275 --> 10:02.110
Please RSVP for you
and your guest"?

10:02.162 --> 10:04.028
A plus-one?

10:04.114 --> 10:05.830
I got to bring Sofia?

10:05.915 --> 10:10.001
Andre, you rancid ass cookie.

10:10.086 --> 10:12.003
<i>During the draft,</i>

10:12.088 --> 10:13.671
you have to make sure
that you take the time

10:13.757 --> 10:15.790
to explain everything to me.
Uh-huh.

10:15.842 --> 10:18.176
'Cause I really want to help.
I really want to participate.

10:18.261 --> 10:20.044
And you've done, like,
a little bit of research?

10:20.130 --> 10:22.930
No, I haven't done research.
It's just a football draft.

10:22.966 --> 10:23.926
You do a pick,

10:23.933 --> 10:25.967
then I do a pick.

10:26.019 --> 10:28.803
So you want to alternate picks.
Yeah. Also, you have to promise me

10:28.888 --> 10:30.605
that if I get bored in the
middle of it or if I don't like

10:30.640 --> 10:33.808
the food or something like that,
that we can just go to dinner.

10:33.860 --> 10:35.476
So you want to leave
in the middle of the draft.

10:35.562 --> 10:38.062
Yeah. Your friends can do
that picky thing for you.

10:38.148 --> 10:40.064
And who would you suggest
would pick my team?

10:40.150 --> 10:43.117
Oh. You get Andre to do it. He
loves you, and he's the champ.

10:43.153 --> 10:45.486
I'm gonna get dressed.
It's gonna be fun.

10:45.572 --> 10:47.155
And we're gonna be a little late.
What?

10:47.207 --> 10:47.955
Yeah. If we miss the first three rounds,

10:47.991 --> 10:49.323
there's still 12 left.

10:49.409 --> 10:51.826
<i>Hola, Mami. ¿Cómo está?</i>

10:51.911 --> 10:53.294
Yeah, 'cause there are
no important picks

10:53.329 --> 10:55.463
in the first three rounds.

10:57.133 --> 10:59.417
I need my stress meds.

10:59.502 --> 11:02.920
Mmm. Mmm.

11:03.006 --> 11:05.473
Mmm. Mmm. Hmm?
No! Papi!

11:09.062 --> 11:11.679
My <i> papi.</i> My <i> papi</i> had a stroke.

11:11.764 --> 11:13.014
What? Oh.
He's in the hospital. Mami wants me

11:13.099 --> 11:15.066
to go to Puerto Rico
right now with Geoffrey.

11:15.151 --> 11:18.352
So does that mean that
you're gonna miss the draft?

11:18.404 --> 11:21.489
Papi's in the hospital! I'm gonna
have to do all the picks on my own?

11:21.524 --> 11:24.442
Oh, God!

11:24.527 --> 11:26.410
Thank you.

11:26.496 --> 11:28.946
Okay, well, let's get you
packed, have some good-bye sex,

11:29.032 --> 11:30.865
and go to the airport.

11:30.917 --> 11:33.000
Let's not worry
about whether you finish or not.

11:33.036 --> 11:35.770
You have so much on your mind.

11:42.477 --> 11:44.010
Welcome

11:44.095 --> 11:45.583
to the Draft of Innocence.

11:45.709 --> 11:48.043
There'll be romance...
Intrigue...

11:48.128 --> 11:50.512
And old-timey drinks.
Old-timey drinks.

11:50.547 --> 11:52.214
Andre, you couldn't rent out
the whole place?

11:52.299 --> 11:54.383
I ran into someone I work
with at the valet. Taco,

11:54.435 --> 11:55.884
did you perm your hair?

11:55.936 --> 11:58.177
Andre had his hair guy sent
to my apartment this morning.

11:58.222 --> 11:59.638
What? Why do you have
a hair guy?

11:59.723 --> 12:00.972
I love Boris.
Oh, gosh.

12:01.058 --> 12:03.725
And your costume is amazing.

12:03.811 --> 12:06.278
There's no zipper in the
pants. So I just go, right?

12:06.363 --> 12:07.896
No, Taco, we have to return them.

12:07.981 --> 12:10.615
Oh. Well, I'd return 'em in a plastic bag.
Okay. Well,

12:10.701 --> 12:12.401
there's Sazerac in the lounge.

12:12.453 --> 12:13.339
Enjoy yourself.

12:13.451 --> 12:15.001
Later I'm gonna clean
your urethra with this thing.

12:15.086 --> 12:16.202
Say it in a Cockney accent.

12:16.287 --> 12:17.620
Pete!

12:17.672 --> 12:19.789
Hi! Welcome.
Hello.

12:19.841 --> 12:22.091
Listen, guys,
I want to apologize

12:22.126 --> 12:24.043
for how off I've been
these past few months. I mean,

12:24.128 --> 12:26.262
it's been a lot
for me to digest,

12:26.297 --> 12:29.181
and I just want to say
I wish you guys the best.

12:29.267 --> 12:31.767
Thank you. That's so great.
Oh.

12:31.803 --> 12:34.604
Okay. Oh, cane, cane, cane!
Get in here. Get in here. Get in here.

12:34.639 --> 12:36.639
Andre, cane, cane. Okay, okay.
All right.

12:36.724 --> 12:40.643
- Anyhow, the way I see it is,
this is a draft. Let's have fun. - Exactly.

12:40.695 --> 12:43.646
- So much fun. - All right, guys, see
you inside. Oh, yeah, no, uh, one thing.

12:43.698 --> 12:45.615
The invite had a plus-one, so...
Yes.

12:45.650 --> 12:47.366
I brought a date,
if that's okay.

12:47.452 --> 12:49.652
That's fantastic.
Love it.

12:49.737 --> 12:52.321
Ah! What's up, dildos?!

12:52.407 --> 12:53.873
Rafi. What?

12:53.958 --> 12:55.124
Who are you?

12:55.159 --> 12:56.375
Uh, that's actually
my girlfriend.

12:56.461 --> 12:58.141
For the evening, right?
How much you paying

12:58.162 --> 13:00.246
for this experience?
I'm not paying for any of it.

13:00.331 --> 13:02.381
What? No.
My name is Meegan.

13:02.467 --> 13:04.050
Hello, Meegan.

13:04.135 --> 13:05.217
Me Rafi.

13:06.504 --> 13:08.304
Tell you what,
why don't we go get some food.

13:08.339 --> 13:09.982
What were you saying about
those oysters on the way over?

13:10.102 --> 13:10.855
Ooh, I love oysters.

13:10.975 --> 13:12.675
'Cause it's like little
salty pussies on a shell.

13:12.727 --> 13:13.643
Mmm.

13:15.763 --> 13:18.347
Just pick 'em up and I,
like, get in there, like, mmm.

13:18.399 --> 13:21.183
Mmm. But I don't eat 'em.
'Cause they're gross.

13:21.235 --> 13:22.267
So I put 'em back.

13:22.387 --> 13:24.004
Okay. You know what, why don't
you go into the sitting room.

13:24.124 --> 13:25.237
Get-get into the sitting room.
Get to it, buddy.

13:25.323 --> 13:27.106
All right. I'll
talk to you later.

13:27.191 --> 13:29.859
Thanks for inviting me, bro.
Hey, who wants to fight?!

13:29.911 --> 13:32.862
I know that you think this is
a hilarious prank, but it's not.

13:32.947 --> 13:34.613
It's gonna backfire
right in your face.

13:34.699 --> 13:35.865
I don't have a problem
with your date.

13:35.917 --> 13:36.999
You shouldn't have a problem
with mine.

13:37.035 --> 13:38.067
Mmm.
Enjoy.

13:38.136 --> 13:39.268
Mmm.

13:42.507 --> 13:43.673
- Hey, guys.
- Ruxin,

13:43.708 --> 13:45.758
I'm so sorry about
your father-in-law.

13:45.843 --> 13:47.927
Yeah, he gave us a real scare.

13:48.012 --> 13:49.378
Thought I was gonna have
to draft with my wife here.

13:50.515 --> 13:51.630
Send Sofia our best.
Yeah.

13:51.716 --> 13:53.966
We all cope in our own way.

13:54.052 --> 13:56.052
All right, it's time to draft.

13:56.137 --> 13:56.936
Russell's gonna be
on speakerphone,

13:57.021 --> 13:58.604
but I have not heard from Chuck.

13:58.690 --> 14:01.140
Actually, he just sent a video.
Check it out.

14:01.225 --> 14:02.975
Hey, guys. So sorry

14:03.061 --> 14:04.610
but I'm gonna have to bow out
of the draft.

14:04.696 --> 14:08.230
As you can see, I'm dealing
with some other issues.

14:08.282 --> 14:09.615
What?
Oh, no.

14:09.701 --> 14:10.900
I like the hat.
Yeah, I, uh,

14:10.985 --> 14:13.202
felt a sharp pain
every time I sat in gum.

14:13.237 --> 14:15.654
Doctors found a lump in my gum.
Turns out I have cancer

14:15.740 --> 14:20.543
of the gum. Uh, the doctors have
given my gum six months to live.

14:20.578 --> 14:21.744
He's gonna lose his gum.

14:21.796 --> 14:23.079
Yeah, pack'll be empty.

14:23.131 --> 14:24.246
I am bored.
So I'm gonna,

14:24.332 --> 14:25.965
you know,
take that gum everywhere.

14:26.050 --> 14:28.084
You know, I'm gonna
sit in the-the pyramids,

14:28.169 --> 14:30.836
the Great Wall of China,
and, you know, God willing,

14:30.922 --> 14:32.304
Ruxin's sweet, sweet head

14:32.390 --> 14:34.590
one last time.
It's his Make-A-Wish.

14:34.642 --> 14:35.674
Go and make that happen, Ruxin.

14:35.760 --> 14:36.809
Enjoy the draft.

14:36.894 --> 14:39.011
Sit in some for me, huh?

14:39.097 --> 14:41.313
That is the most depressing
final wish I've ever heard.

14:41.399 --> 14:42.932
Where we gonna find
an eighth team now?

14:42.984 --> 14:44.066
- Fine, I'll join.
- What?

14:44.102 --> 14:46.402
We don't have time
to find an eighth guy.

14:46.437 --> 14:48.320
Here's a thought. What
if we make it completely random,

14:48.406 --> 14:50.439
like, we just flip a coin
for each decision?

14:50.525 --> 14:53.943
We could call it the Coin, and
we see if we can beat Random.

14:53.995 --> 14:56.245
Any questions we have for that
team, we just flip the Coin.

14:56.280 --> 14:57.113
It's the Coin, yeah.
Great.

14:57.198 --> 15:00.282
Or we can get a wolf.

15:00.368 --> 15:02.034
Dinner is served.

15:03.788 --> 15:05.504
Does the napkin glove go
to the left or the right

15:05.590 --> 15:06.789
of the fish knife?

15:06.841 --> 15:08.340
Taco, no.

15:08.426 --> 15:11.460
As we draft, we dine.

15:11.512 --> 15:14.213
Great. Let's go.
Time to eat.

15:15.767 --> 15:16.799
It's not a buffet.

15:16.884 --> 15:18.801
It's assigned seating, actually.

15:18.853 --> 15:20.302
Ruxin, that butter
is for the entire table.

15:20.354 --> 15:22.304
You can't take
the whole bottle of wine.

15:22.356 --> 15:23.973
Did everyone get a napkin glove?

15:24.058 --> 15:26.392
What's going on, Raf? No food.
Everything here

15:26.477 --> 15:29.145
looks like shit.
Plus, I bring my own food, bro.

15:29.230 --> 15:30.196
Oh, pocket dog. That's right.

15:30.281 --> 15:31.730
No, this is a crotch-et dog.

15:31.816 --> 15:34.450
Oh, got it.
I keep it in my crotch so it stays hot.

15:37.488 --> 15:41.657
Now, I have only one thing
to say to you.

15:44.212 --> 15:45.327
What?
Huh?

15:45.413 --> 15:46.078
I'm sorry, who?

15:48.332 --> 15:49.331
- Can't understand you.
- Can't understand you.

15:49.417 --> 15:51.300
Le'Veon Bell, Le'Veon Bell.

15:51.335 --> 15:52.968
Five dollars.
Five dollars, okay, do I see ten?

15:53.004 --> 15:54.503
Ten.
Ten. Do I see 15?

15:54.589 --> 15:56.088
15. Do I see 20?
20.

15:56.174 --> 15:57.473
I see 20, do I see 25?
25.

15:57.508 --> 15:58.674
I see 25, do I see 30?

15:58.726 --> 15:59.842
$35.
$35.

15:59.927 --> 16:01.093
Do I see 40?
40.

16:01.179 --> 16:02.845
$40. Do I see 45?

16:02.897 --> 16:03.929
A dollar.
A dollar.

16:04.015 --> 16:06.649
Taco, this is not how it works.

16:06.684 --> 16:08.067
Sorry.
What is a dollar?

16:08.152 --> 16:09.935
45.
47.

16:10.021 --> 16:11.604
47. Do I see 50?

16:12.940 --> 16:16.408
Sold to Pete Eckhart!

16:16.494 --> 16:20.029
And now may my sticker maiden
place the name on the board.

16:20.114 --> 16:22.364
Jamaal Charles.
I got my Gronk.

16:22.450 --> 16:24.500
My Gronki-Gronk.
LeShaun McCoy, sold

16:24.535 --> 16:26.035
to the Shit Pail!

16:26.087 --> 16:29.121
Oh, yeah!
Suck it!

16:29.207 --> 16:30.673
- Oh, my God.
- Ugh.

16:30.708 --> 16:32.424
We got Amari Cooper.

16:32.510 --> 16:33.876
Nice pick.

16:33.961 --> 16:35.628
Yeah, great pick.
Oh!

16:35.713 --> 16:38.130
Both really know how to find that hole.
Point of order--

16:38.216 --> 16:40.099
when are we gonna stop
doing just football players,

16:40.184 --> 16:41.383
right? Like,
w... I need

16:41.469 --> 16:42.801
a Filipino housemaid and I need

16:42.887 --> 16:44.770
a little Thai
he-she kid for sex.

16:44.856 --> 16:45.888
It's not that kind of auction.

16:45.973 --> 16:47.139
It's not?
This looks like

16:47.225 --> 16:48.891
a bunch of white people
bidding on minorities,

16:48.976 --> 16:51.110
- dressed in old-timey clothes.
- You, well...

16:51.195 --> 16:52.645
This is a slave auction, Andre.
No.

16:52.730 --> 16:54.010
We're all cool with that, right?

16:54.031 --> 16:55.197
It's not a slave auction.

16:55.233 --> 16:57.233
But everybody's black
on the auction block.

16:57.285 --> 16:58.901
Not everyone is gonna be black.
They...

16:58.986 --> 17:00.452
We're gonna get some kickers in here eventually.
Have you sold

17:00.538 --> 17:01.904
any white people yet?

17:01.989 --> 17:03.239
We're gonna get to it
in the later rounds.

17:03.291 --> 17:05.124
We're...
at running backs.

17:05.209 --> 17:06.575
No.
No.

17:06.627 --> 17:09.377
I would like to buy
a vowel, please-- S.

17:09.413 --> 17:11.997
S? You got to pick
a player, Taco.

17:12.083 --> 17:13.632
Fine. Are there
any kickers left?

17:13.718 --> 17:15.084
Yeah.
All of them.

17:15.169 --> 17:16.719
Okay, I'll take
my Eskimo brother

17:16.753 --> 17:18.921
Sebastian Janikowski
for one dollar.

17:19.006 --> 17:19.888
That actually makes sense.

17:19.924 --> 17:21.173
Any takers?
One dollar.

17:21.259 --> 17:23.309
No one? All right,
going once, going twice.

17:23.394 --> 17:24.393
Five dollars.

17:24.428 --> 17:26.428
Five dollars going
once, going twice.

17:26.480 --> 17:27.762
Still no one?
Ten dollars!

17:27.815 --> 17:29.515
Taco... what are you doing?
What are you doing?

17:29.600 --> 17:30.316
$12.

17:30.401 --> 17:31.483
You got this, okay?

17:31.569 --> 17:33.569
Who is $20?

17:33.604 --> 17:35.437
$20 for Sebastian Janikowski,

17:35.489 --> 17:37.823
no other takers on the table...
25.

17:37.909 --> 17:40.609
Why are you doing this?
I'd like to phone a friend, please.

17:40.695 --> 17:41.827
You don't need to phone a friend.
That's the wrong game.

17:41.913 --> 17:42.912
Who would you phone?

17:42.947 --> 17:44.580
Pete.
He's right beside you.

17:44.615 --> 17:45.748
- You don't have to use a phone...
- Hello?

17:45.783 --> 17:47.866
Hi, Pete.
Uh, should I go up?

17:47.952 --> 17:49.668
If you want this player, you got to get him.
All right.

17:49.754 --> 17:50.703
Thanks, Pete.

17:50.788 --> 17:53.956
$150, final answer.

17:54.008 --> 17:55.329
Really? We're
letting him do this?

17:55.960 --> 17:58.127
Going once, going twice...

17:58.212 --> 17:59.345
Oh, things a Cobb salad
would say!

17:59.430 --> 18:01.297
What?
I'd like to solve the puzzle.

18:01.382 --> 18:03.299
No, in what context
would a Cobb salad

18:03.351 --> 18:05.768
say "going once, going twice"?

18:05.803 --> 18:09.438
Lettuce just say that you are
bacon something egg-cellent.

18:09.473 --> 18:11.307
That is something
a Cobb salad would say.

18:11.392 --> 18:14.143
Nailed it. How does that feel,
you piece of garbage?

18:14.228 --> 18:15.978
Okay, the winner

18:16.063 --> 18:18.731
for Sebastian Janikowski
is Taco.

18:18.816 --> 18:19.898
Yeah!

18:19.984 --> 18:21.200
Just a reminder--

18:21.285 --> 18:23.285
you only have 50
fantasy dollars left.

18:23.321 --> 18:25.371
Oh, that's fine, I'll just
borrow some from Kevin.

18:25.456 --> 18:27.239
No.
Andre, are you gonna draft anyone?

18:29.410 --> 18:31.493
I just got too caught up
in the auctioneering.

18:31.545 --> 18:32.795
We got to start over.

18:32.830 --> 18:34.463
No.
So screwed.

18:34.498 --> 18:36.382
Andre, this draft
has blown up in your face

18:36.467 --> 18:39.418
like a firework
in Jason Pierre-Paul's hand.

18:39.503 --> 18:40.973
Who's that?
He plays for the Giants.

18:41.093 --> 18:41.755
Got it.

18:45.613 --> 18:47.052
Okay. Andre, get out of the way.

18:47.053 --> 18:49.356
I'm gonna show you idiots how it's done.

18:49.357 --> 18:50.491
What is that?

18:50.492 --> 18:51.593
Okay, here we go.

18:51.594 --> 18:52.962
No, no, no, no!

18:52.963 --> 18:54.330
Rafi... Next item on the block,

18:54.331 --> 18:56.100
Ming Wu. Oh, my God. The hell

18:56.101 --> 18:58.471
are you doing, man?! Come on, time
to go to work, honey, time to go to work.

18:58.472 --> 19:00.107
Let's go. The floor is open.

19:00.108 --> 19:01.142
I'm taking bids.

19:01.143 --> 19:02.945
Ma'am, are you a kicker? She kicks.

19:02.946 --> 19:04.881
Show him how you kick.

19:04.882 --> 19:06.617
We're not auctioning off a woman.
Show him a kick.

19:06.618 --> 19:08.287
Why? You auctioned off all these men.

19:08.288 --> 19:09.889
Why can't I auction a woman off?

19:09.890 --> 19:11.492
That is misogyny,

19:11.493 --> 19:13.428
a word I was recently told.

19:13.429 --> 19:16.400
Come on, guys, who's bidding?
Let's go, let's go.

19:16.401 --> 19:19.438
Oh, do not start with me.

19:19.439 --> 19:21.074
How dare you?

19:21.075 --> 19:22.509
Ma'am, ma'am...

19:22.510 --> 19:23.544
ma'am, I'm sorry, ma'am.

19:23.545 --> 19:25.280
She has

19:25.281 --> 19:26.583
put a curse on all of us.

19:26.584 --> 19:28.552
What the hell was that, Rafi?
You know what,

19:28.553 --> 19:31.357
I thought you guys were cool and
wanted to have an auction.

19:31.358 --> 19:33.961
Guess not, so suck it.

19:33.962 --> 19:36.398
Okay, can we just finish this? Yes.

19:36.399 --> 19:38.602
Does anyone else have anyone
they'd like to auction?

19:38.603 --> 19:41.406
Oh, yeah, I got something. Okay,
sure, go ahead. What do you got?

19:41.407 --> 19:42.642
Whoa!

19:42.643 --> 19:44.044
Where did you get that? No.

19:44.045 --> 19:46.181
What is your arm doing in a toilet?

19:46.182 --> 19:48.451
I was fishing out a contact lens.
Out of a toilet?

19:48.452 --> 19:50.420
It was a hard contact.
You look like an extra

19:50.421 --> 19:53.692
from A Different World.
We're not offering up personal items.

19:53.693 --> 19:55.896
I'd like to bid ten dollars
on that picture, please.

19:55.897 --> 19:57.265
20 to have it framed. 20.

19:57.266 --> 19:58.968
30 to have it destroyed. 30.

19:58.969 --> 20:01.005
40 to make a T-shirt out of it.
50 to make it my team page.

20:01.006 --> 20:02.307
No, no, no! Pete,

20:02.308 --> 20:03.508
I know what you're doing, okay?

20:03.509 --> 20:05.111
And you're wrecking this
Draft of Innocence.

20:05.112 --> 20:08.416
Oh, please, Andre, this draft
is like the Pro Bowl, okay?

20:08.417 --> 20:10.654
Everybody's here, but frankly it sucks.

20:10.655 --> 20:12.623
You, sir, have besmirched

20:12.624 --> 20:16.295
my honor and the honor of my paramour.

20:16.296 --> 20:18.566
Ooh.

20:18.567 --> 20:21.037
I challenge you to a duel.

20:22.473 --> 20:23.508
Ooh!

20:24.510 --> 20:26.913
No. This is bullshit,

20:26.914 --> 20:29.050
and I'm out of here.
Enjoy your new guy. No,

20:29.051 --> 20:31.253
I challenge you to a duel,
you can't just walk out.

20:31.254 --> 20:33.056
Pete, it's a duel!

20:33.057 --> 20:34.458
Pete.

20:34.459 --> 20:36.194
Pete, we must duel.

20:36.195 --> 20:38.197
I don't have to do anything, Lord Andre.

20:38.198 --> 20:39.566
I am the champion, I make the rules,

20:39.567 --> 20:41.035
I say we duel.

20:41.036 --> 20:42.438
You cannot besmirch someone's

20:42.439 --> 20:44.307
honor and then not duel! I'll besmirch

20:44.308 --> 20:46.077
the whole goddamn thing, Andre.

20:53.292 --> 20:54.504
_

20:54.624 --> 20:55.659
Who are they?

20:55.660 --> 20:56.994
Yeah, I think this might have

20:56.995 --> 20:58.297
something to do with Ming Wu.

20:59.466 --> 21:01.034
Let me handle this. I got this.

21:01.035 --> 21:02.603
Hi there. Uh, I think
there's been a little bit

21:02.604 --> 21:04.072
of a misunderstanding here.

21:04.073 --> 21:06.142
Oh! Oh... Oh, oh,

21:06.143 --> 21:07.478
oh, shit.

21:07.479 --> 21:09.147
My good man,

21:09.148 --> 21:11.218
I did not want to resort
to physical violence.

21:11.219 --> 21:13.688
But you leave me no choice. Ha!

21:16.594 --> 21:19.965
_

21:22.102 --> 21:23.737
Aah!

21:23.738 --> 21:25.039
Ooh! Bartitsu!

21:25.040 --> 21:26.242
I warned you, my good man.

21:26.243 --> 21:27.276
A dollar.

21:32.118 --> 21:34.120
Put your dick in his mouth, Andre!
Shame him!

21:34.121 --> 21:36.057
Andre, he's got

21:36.058 --> 21:37.292
a mop. Aah!

21:37.293 --> 21:39.463
Oh!

21:39.464 --> 21:41.466
Ooh! Oh, he's got a knife!

21:43.203 --> 21:44.604
Yes!

21:44.605 --> 21:45.973
Five dollars.

21:45.974 --> 21:47.241
Somebody kill somebody!

21:47.242 --> 21:48.710
I want to see a ghost!

21:51.516 --> 21:53.285
Oh!

21:55.322 --> 21:56.590
Ah...

21:56.591 --> 21:58.026
Mm.

21:59.629 --> 22:00.730
Mm.

22:00.731 --> 22:02.266
This thing works pretty well.

22:02.267 --> 22:04.236
Ooh!  Whoa!

22:06.674 --> 22:08.375
Snuffbox!

22:10.346 --> 22:12.282
$20, final answer.

22:13.418 --> 22:15.153
Assistance!

22:15.154 --> 22:17.090
Here! Pocket dog?

22:17.091 --> 22:18.625
Here!

22:23.167 --> 22:25.370
Holy shit.

22:25.371 --> 22:27.073
Shall we get back to the draft?

22:27.074 --> 22:28.609
_

22:28.610 --> 22:31.045
My hero. Our hero.

22:31.046 --> 22:32.465
I'm switching to Team Andre.

22:32.466 --> 22:33.833
Oh, I'm gonna be sick. So...

22:33.834 --> 22:35.463
Are we gonna ookie-cookie

22:35.583 --> 22:36.979
all over this guy's face, or what?

22:37.099 --> 22:47.362
