WEBVTT

00:01.200 --> 00:05.107
A few months ago,
the Veritas was translated again.

00:05.250 --> 00:07.769
Everyone who worked on
the translation and everyone who

00:07.839 --> 00:10.795
subsequently read it is now dead.

00:10.946 --> 00:13.985
- Your tutor's a what?
- An Alien.

00:14.158 --> 00:15.865
What do you mean, an Alien?

00:15.988 --> 00:19.505
A space one. A space Alien.

00:20.130 --> 00:23.099
Will you read the Veritas?

00:23.170 --> 00:26.607
So, you're blind and you don't want
your enemies to know?

00:28.930 --> 00:32.404
So... your tutor ran
a computer simulation...

00:32.506 --> 00:35.287
Well, yeah - more like he got, like,
trapped inside one.

00:35.380 --> 00:36.505
Can that happen?

00:36.591 --> 00:37.615
Yeah, he's an Alien.

00:37.708 --> 00:41.787
- A space one.
- Yeah, a space one.

00:42.555 --> 00:45.336
Let's just call it a sort of dream.

00:53.259 --> 00:55.455
Are you just completely mad?

00:55.669 --> 00:56.947
Is it working?

00:57.030 --> 00:58.220
A little bit.

00:58.321 --> 00:59.728
Not so mad, then.

01:00.899 --> 01:02.970
What are you doing?

01:03.330 --> 01:06.228
I'm doing what everybody does
when the world is in danger -

01:06.346 --> 01:07.745
I'm calling the Doctor.

01:07.855 --> 01:09.212
Pressing send.

01:12.610 --> 01:15.117
So this computer-simulation-dream
thing...

01:15.421 --> 01:16.692
- Yeah?
- ..which, to be clear,

01:16.778 --> 01:18.083
I don't believe a word of...

01:18.210 --> 01:19.817
- Fair enough.
- ..you said I was in it?

01:19.877 --> 01:23.489
- Yeah.
- How did it go? The dream version.

01:30.960 --> 01:33.100
The Pope? In person.

01:33.195 --> 01:35.319
The Pope, in your flat. Here?

01:35.354 --> 01:36.433
Yeah.

01:36.464 --> 01:38.063
Your tutor has strange dreams.

01:38.104 --> 01:39.326
I bet he does, you know.

01:39.476 --> 01:42.311
Maybe he's just trying to keep you
on the straight and narrow.

01:44.139 --> 01:45.379
Maybe, yeah.

01:47.260 --> 01:48.951
How do you feel on the subject?

01:52.095 --> 01:53.334
Stay where you are!

01:54.032 --> 01:55.103
Clear.

01:55.165 --> 01:57.900
Please remain still and calm.
Sit down.

01:59.517 --> 02:02.564
Keep your hands in sight on
the table. Miss Potts?

02:02.650 --> 02:04.329
- Yeah.
- Who is this?

02:04.657 --> 02:06.970
This is my friend Penny.
Who the hell are you?

02:07.106 --> 02:08.892
Room secure, your Excellency.

02:10.961 --> 02:12.585
This is Miss Potts, sir.

02:12.673 --> 02:13.744
Hi.

02:13.813 --> 02:17.332
Miss Potts, this is
the Secretary-General of the UN.

02:17.790 --> 02:21.241
I have flown here today to speak
to the President.

02:21.532 --> 02:24.327
I am told you might be
able to help.

02:24.446 --> 02:26.165
I don't know the President.

02:26.475 --> 02:29.249
How would I know the President?
I wouldn't even have voted for him,

02:29.297 --> 02:31.030
he's... orange.

02:31.147 --> 02:34.536
I mean THE President. The Doctor.

02:35.108 --> 02:36.718
The Doctor's not a president.

02:37.436 --> 02:38.991
What's he president of?

02:39.180 --> 02:42.660
Well, in times of crisis...

02:44.353 --> 02:45.713
..Earth.

02:46.860 --> 02:48.860
Is it OK if I get an Uber?

02:51.305 --> 02:53.180
President of the world?

02:53.252 --> 02:59.071
In times of unusual danger,
that status is made official.

02:59.911 --> 03:02.110
Turmezistan, near the border.

03:02.298 --> 03:06.391
This is a disputed area
potential hot spot.

03:06.466 --> 03:09.001
The Chinese have troops here,

03:09.290 --> 03:12.212
the Russians here,
the Americans here.

03:12.352 --> 03:13.529
And in the centre...

03:14.815 --> 03:16.016
A pyramid.

03:16.081 --> 03:18.376
Sir, I have Colonel Brabbit
on the line.

03:18.571 --> 03:20.915
Colonel Brabbit, you're on with
the Secretary-General.

03:21.046 --> 03:23.532
Colonel, what have you to report?

03:23.650 --> 03:26.165
Nothing, sir. Nothing at all.

03:26.411 --> 03:28.071
It seems dormant.

03:28.353 --> 03:31.048
The Russians and the Chinese
are reporting the same.

03:31.120 --> 03:33.571
Reporting what? What's dormant?

03:33.730 --> 03:37.509
The pyramid.
We are keeping it under observation.

03:39.253 --> 03:40.732
Why? What's it been doing?

03:40.792 --> 03:41.824
You haven't told her?

03:41.898 --> 03:43.257
I haven't, no.

03:43.328 --> 03:45.247
'It's a 5,000-year-old pyramid.

03:45.530 --> 03:47.209
'But there's one problem with that.'

03:47.491 --> 03:48.891
One little problem.

03:50.177 --> 03:51.786
It wasn't there yesterday.

04:24.463 --> 04:27.417
<font color=#FF00FF>*DOCTOR WHO*</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>"The Pyramid at the End of the World"</font>

04:43.779 --> 04:47.678
The end of your life
has already begun.

04:51.561 --> 04:55.357
There is a last place
you will ever go,

04:55.889 --> 04:58.396
a last door
you will ever walk through,

04:58.779 --> 05:01.053
a last sight you will ever see,

05:01.286 --> 05:03.568
and every step you ever take

05:04.014 --> 05:05.734
is moving you closer.

05:09.038 --> 05:10.452
The end of the world...

05:11.730 --> 05:15.280
..is a billion,
billion tiny moments.

05:15.457 --> 05:16.788
Don't shut the door...!

05:18.914 --> 05:21.221
And somewhere, unnoticed...

05:21.251 --> 05:22.357
Sorry!

05:22.693 --> 05:24.972
..in silence or in darkness...

05:25.432 --> 05:26.596
Dammit!

05:26.752 --> 05:28.604
..it has already begun.

05:28.689 --> 05:30.682
You talking to yourself in there?

05:32.344 --> 05:34.103
I'm meditating.

05:34.539 --> 05:36.500
You've been in there for hours.

05:36.756 --> 05:38.649
I've been trying to talk to you.

05:40.026 --> 05:42.149
Have you double-locked this thing?

05:43.003 --> 05:44.649
I'm busy thinking.

05:45.344 --> 05:47.781
Excellent - who needs eyesight?

05:48.898 --> 05:51.177
Those Monk creatures
I told you about -

05:51.554 --> 05:54.429
if they've modelled every event
in human history,

05:55.032 --> 05:59.835
if they've simulated entire events
streamed from day one till now,

06:00.646 --> 06:02.437
think what they'd know.

06:03.352 --> 06:05.192
Think what they could do with that.

06:06.613 --> 06:10.699
The UN called. They want you
in Turmezistan immediately.

06:10.754 --> 06:12.274
Tell them no!

06:15.007 --> 06:16.069
Oh...

06:16.148 --> 06:18.282
They wouldn't take no for an answer.

06:21.122 --> 06:22.761
How did they get it
out of my office?

06:22.825 --> 06:24.327
The windows aren't big enough.

06:24.361 --> 06:27.360
Oh... They are now.

06:27.690 --> 06:29.159
Are you going to ask
what's going on?

06:29.198 --> 06:31.048
Last I heard, you were on a date
with Penny.

06:31.073 --> 06:32.134
What happened?

06:32.159 --> 06:34.890
The United Nations
Secretary-General.

06:35.009 --> 06:36.148
Awesome.

06:36.193 --> 06:37.507
No, that wasn't a metaphor.

06:37.546 --> 06:39.804
Good, because I really wasn't
following it.

06:39.905 --> 06:42.960
Mr President,
I'm very pleased to see you.

06:43.223 --> 06:45.976
I think we have something
of interest.

06:48.780 --> 06:51.015
Why don't you tell me
in your own words?

06:51.587 --> 06:53.874
It's a matter of a pyramid.

07:13.311 --> 07:16.330
Ah... You're an angel.

07:24.011 --> 07:26.770
You look - and don't take this
the wrong way -

07:26.958 --> 07:28.077
you look awful.

07:28.133 --> 07:30.652
How could anyone possibly take
that the wrong way?

07:30.755 --> 07:32.449
Big night last night?

07:34.667 --> 07:35.858
There was drinking.

07:35.891 --> 07:38.081
There were breakages.

07:38.550 --> 07:39.691
Textbook.

07:39.801 --> 07:41.440
We going to stage two today?

07:41.586 --> 07:44.355
Well, it would be rude not to.
You OK mixing it?

07:44.405 --> 07:46.003
I broke my reading glasses.

08:59.856 --> 09:01.599
Tell me what you see.

09:02.216 --> 09:04.123
A 5,000-year-old pyramid.

09:04.896 --> 09:06.029
What do you know?

09:06.112 --> 09:07.615
It wasn't there yesterday.

09:07.816 --> 09:08.976
Therefore?

09:10.916 --> 09:12.534
It's not really a pyramid,

09:12.644 --> 09:15.167
it's something disguised
as a pyramid,

09:15.232 --> 09:17.391
that... just appeared out of thin air.

09:17.493 --> 09:19.284
That's all way beyond
human technology,

09:19.309 --> 09:20.901
so it's got to be Alien.

09:20.974 --> 09:22.096
It's an Alien space ship.

09:22.162 --> 09:23.321
There you go.

09:23.596 --> 09:24.815
But what's it doing?

09:24.888 --> 09:26.402
It could have chosen anywhere
on this planet.

09:26.426 --> 09:29.245
It chose to sit
on the strategic intersection

09:29.302 --> 09:31.729
of the three most powerful armies
on Earth.

09:31.966 --> 09:33.646
So what it's doing, Colonel...

09:35.104 --> 09:36.463
..is sending us a message.

09:36.558 --> 09:37.877
What message?

09:38.268 --> 09:39.548
"Bring it."

09:42.725 --> 09:43.765
BEEPING

09:47.355 --> 09:48.674
Mr President?

09:48.723 --> 09:50.443
Sir? What are you doing?

09:53.542 --> 09:54.582
Bringing it.

09:55.680 --> 09:56.720
Nardole.

09:58.490 --> 09:59.689
On it, sir.

10:00.190 --> 10:01.925
What's he doing?

10:02.185 --> 10:05.136
We don't know what that thing
is capable of!

10:11.981 --> 10:14.606
Nothing yet, all looks fine.

10:15.606 --> 10:17.046
What are you doing?

10:18.263 --> 10:19.630
Updating him.

10:37.983 --> 10:40.031
There's something's happening, sir.

10:40.530 --> 10:43.179
It's opening up, sir.
There's a door.

10:46.015 --> 10:47.694
Nardole?

10:47.835 --> 10:49.640
Something's coming out, sir.

10:54.130 --> 10:56.882
Going by the description you gave me
from the simulation, sir,

10:56.942 --> 10:59.015
I think that's one of
the Monk creatures.

10:59.146 --> 11:00.385
Hello?

11:00.749 --> 11:02.078
We know you.

11:02.235 --> 11:04.834
Then you'll know
that there is a line in the sand,

11:05.054 --> 11:07.125
and I'm the man
on the other side of it -

11:07.596 --> 11:09.078
you want to keep me that way.

11:09.166 --> 11:12.285
We will take this planet
and its people.

11:12.365 --> 11:14.684
You will be prevented.
You will be fought.

11:14.770 --> 11:16.976
We will be invited.

11:17.566 --> 11:21.726
We will take this world.
We will rule its people.

11:21.880 --> 11:24.796
But only when we're asked.

11:26.055 --> 11:28.007
We will talk again.

11:28.108 --> 11:29.250
When?

11:29.364 --> 11:31.404
At the end of the Earth.

11:44.039 --> 11:46.263
- 11.57.
- PM.

11:46.502 --> 11:48.193
Yeah, mine too.

11:50.818 --> 11:54.388
It's everyone's. 11.57PM.

11:56.455 --> 11:59.774
Did you get that, sir?
Everyone's phone's gone to 11.57.

11:59.955 --> 12:01.521
Yep, same here.

12:01.650 --> 12:03.010
What's...

12:03.728 --> 12:05.513
What does that mean, 11.57?

12:05.618 --> 12:08.880
Also known as three minutes
to midnight.

12:09.029 --> 12:10.548
The Doomsday Clock.

12:10.596 --> 12:11.654
The what?

12:11.694 --> 12:13.091
Symbolic clock face,

12:13.144 --> 12:16.943
representing a countdown
to possible global catastrophe,

12:17.007 --> 12:20.076
started by some atomic scientists
in 1947.

12:20.318 --> 12:21.958
The closer they set the clock
to midnight,

12:21.982 --> 12:25.301
the closer we are
to global disaster.

12:25.490 --> 12:28.865
Currently, it's set
at three minutes to midnight.

12:28.950 --> 12:32.959
So now every clock in the world
is the Doomsday Clock?

12:33.099 --> 12:34.232
Thanks to the Monks, yes.

12:34.357 --> 12:35.560
Is this a threat?

12:35.639 --> 12:37.216
I wish it was, threats are easy.

12:37.324 --> 12:39.723
I think this is a warning.

12:39.974 --> 12:43.013
Somewhere, somehow...

12:44.128 --> 12:45.488
..the end has begun.

13:10.675 --> 13:12.154
Fully automated.

13:13.034 --> 13:14.369
Lunch?

13:14.705 --> 13:16.472
Well, it would be rude not to.

13:41.257 --> 13:44.816
- Hello. Privyet. Sorry about that.
- Ah!

13:44.957 --> 13:47.030
Needed the call to zero in
on your co-ordinates.

13:47.106 --> 13:51.030
Now, this is the Secretary-General
of the UN.

13:51.319 --> 13:53.522
I am the President of the world.

13:53.589 --> 13:59.694
And this is Xiaolian,
she's in charge of the Chinese army.

14:00.075 --> 14:01.858
Say hi to each other.

14:03.949 --> 14:05.777
Now, we've been having
a bit of chat.

14:05.868 --> 14:09.324
The thing is, World War Three -
what do you think?

14:09.579 --> 14:11.340
Basically, we're against it.

14:12.888 --> 14:14.287
Listen to me.

14:14.858 --> 14:17.388
Those creatures in that pyramid,
they have studied your species,

14:17.467 --> 14:19.754
your civilisation,
your entire history.

14:19.800 --> 14:21.738
They have run a computer simulation
of this world

14:21.784 --> 14:24.385
since you lot first slopped out of
the ocean looking for a fight,

14:24.410 --> 14:25.903
and they have chosen
this exact moment

14:26.025 --> 14:28.724
and this exact place to arrive.

14:28.915 --> 14:30.154
Why?

14:30.251 --> 14:32.410
Because a war's about to break out?

14:32.810 --> 14:34.210
Possibly.

14:35.086 --> 14:39.609
But whatever it is,
they are right here, right now

14:39.757 --> 14:44.148
because they believe humanity
will be at its weakest.

14:44.332 --> 14:48.320
Then we'll demonstrate strength.
We will attack the pyramid.

14:48.423 --> 14:51.953
Force is never the answer.
Isn't that right, Doctor?

14:54.837 --> 14:57.478
Contact your masters.
Co-ordinate your attacks.

14:57.598 --> 14:58.627
Doctor?

14:58.666 --> 15:00.211
I doubt you'll even scratch
that thing,

15:00.236 --> 15:02.408
but if you demonstrate
strength and unity,

15:02.531 --> 15:03.868
they might choose to step away.

15:03.950 --> 15:05.989
Bill, take that look
off your face.

15:06.170 --> 15:07.564
There's no look on my face.

15:07.607 --> 15:09.890
They did not come here in peace,
we have to do what we can.

15:09.914 --> 15:11.793
Yeah, I get it.

15:20.164 --> 15:21.797
It's two minutes to now.

15:22.211 --> 15:24.157
The Doomsday Clock is moving.

15:24.248 --> 15:25.438
What do we do?

15:25.535 --> 15:27.454
Co-ordinate your attacks.

15:40.260 --> 15:41.580
What's wrong with him?

15:43.330 --> 15:45.050
What's wrong with the Doctor?

16:02.902 --> 16:05.101
Did Nardole send you to speak to me?

16:05.610 --> 16:06.964
Might have done.

16:07.032 --> 16:09.872
Might have said there was something
you ought to tell me.

16:11.910 --> 16:13.710
Funny thing, fear, isn't it?

16:18.843 --> 16:23.288
Once it rules you, you're even
afraid to admit what's scaring you.

16:23.554 --> 16:27.015
For the record, I, for one,
fully understand my weakness.

16:29.530 --> 16:31.250
Oh, God, what's that?

16:49.432 --> 16:52.589
'Approaching target.
Permission to strike.'

16:53.248 --> 16:55.518
So, why is the pyramid active now?

16:55.653 --> 16:58.221
Possibly they know
they're about to be bombed.

17:02.149 --> 17:04.949
Target distance ten miles -
set position five degrees.

17:23.076 --> 17:26.191
Red 12. Mayday! MAYDAY!

17:56.199 --> 17:59.769
It's the Monks!
They've hijacked the plane.

18:00.220 --> 18:01.900
How did they do that?

18:15.726 --> 18:19.486
Oh, they're fine.
The crew are alive.

18:20.835 --> 18:22.195
Who are those guys?

18:23.019 --> 18:24.365
I think they're ours.

18:24.421 --> 18:25.491
Yours?

18:25.520 --> 18:28.124
We targeted the pyramid
with a missile.

18:38.135 --> 18:39.494
From a submarine.

18:39.745 --> 18:42.566
So, demonstrating strength
isn't going to help.

18:45.090 --> 18:49.863
We are ready to talk.

18:57.878 --> 19:00.958
Why don't you just take the
afternoon off if you feel that bad?

19:02.514 --> 19:04.546
I can't just take the afternoon off!

19:04.738 --> 19:07.007
How about a kip on the floor
under your desk?

19:07.319 --> 19:09.600
Now, that's an idea
I can get behind.

19:48.222 --> 19:50.230
I mean, this is a trap, right?

19:51.388 --> 19:54.081
Possibly. Probably.

19:56.488 --> 19:58.613
And we're just walking into it.

19:58.728 --> 20:00.137
Well, every trap you walk into

20:00.192 --> 20:02.431
is a chance to learn
about your enemies.

20:02.738 --> 20:04.129
Impossible to set a trap

20:04.220 --> 20:07.060
without making a self-portrait
of your own weaknesses.

20:07.645 --> 20:10.450
Great... unless it kills us.

20:11.530 --> 20:13.610
Well, you could say that
about anything.

20:35.644 --> 20:38.870
The human race is about to end.

20:39.140 --> 20:42.402
The chain of events
is already in motion.

20:42.516 --> 20:47.475
Life on Earth will cease
by humanity's own hand.

20:47.764 --> 20:50.316
Observe.

21:09.056 --> 21:10.415
Ah...

21:10.861 --> 21:13.485
The simulation machine looks
a bit different from the outside.

21:13.574 --> 21:16.157
We are modelling the future.

21:16.333 --> 21:20.572
Each thread is a chain of days,
leading to your end.

21:20.659 --> 21:24.478
We can detect when a catastrophe
is about to occur.

21:24.526 --> 21:25.586
And?

21:25.642 --> 21:27.525
Stop it from occurring.

21:27.557 --> 21:29.689
You don't look much like
guardian angels.

21:29.770 --> 21:32.889
We have chosen this form
to look like you.

21:33.048 --> 21:34.173
You look like corpses.

21:34.243 --> 21:37.907
You ARE corpses to us.

21:38.044 --> 21:41.556
Your world is ending.
You can do nothing.

21:41.702 --> 21:43.353
But we can save you.

21:43.446 --> 21:44.634
Save us, then.

21:44.713 --> 21:48.126
To save you, we must be asked.

21:48.290 --> 21:49.470
Then what?

21:49.607 --> 21:51.556
We will protect you.

21:51.751 --> 21:52.938
How long for?

21:53.026 --> 21:54.696
Forever.

21:56.752 --> 22:01.049
Do you understand now? Do you see?

22:01.570 --> 22:05.088
Asking them for help has conditions.

22:06.364 --> 22:11.080
Invite them in, and it will be
the last free action you take.

22:11.212 --> 22:16.372
If you do not ask for help,
then see the days to come.

22:19.095 --> 22:23.852
Theses are the threads that lead
to one year in your future.

22:24.040 --> 22:27.569
Take them as proof.

22:46.205 --> 22:47.404
What was that?

22:47.484 --> 22:49.855
Planet Earth, with not a single
living thing.

22:50.424 --> 22:51.704
Dead as the moon.

22:52.451 --> 22:54.636
You seem pretty damn calm about it.

22:54.780 --> 22:59.339
Do I? Oh, I'm sorry -
it's not my first dead planet.

22:59.629 --> 23:02.839
Ask for help, it will be given.

23:02.878 --> 23:04.027
Why do you need to be asked?

23:04.089 --> 23:06.378
Power must consent.

23:06.449 --> 23:08.144
Power must consent?
What does that mean?

23:08.231 --> 23:14.558
Those who hold power on this world
must consent to our dominion.

23:15.563 --> 23:16.792
Why?

23:21.775 --> 23:23.641
One minute to midnight.

23:24.913 --> 23:28.235
You could take this planet
in a... in a heartbeat.

23:28.572 --> 23:29.930
Why do you need consent?

23:30.051 --> 23:34.001
We must be wanted. We must be loved.

23:34.106 --> 23:36.790
To rule through fear is inefficient.

23:36.894 --> 23:39.048
Of course. Fear is temporary.

23:39.124 --> 23:42.204
Love... is slavery.

23:43.547 --> 23:47.938
If consent is what you need,
I consent now.

23:48.116 --> 23:51.180
No. No, don't do this.
Please, don't even consider this!

23:51.249 --> 23:55.524
What I saw was real. I felt it!

23:59.450 --> 24:03.083
If you can help us, I consent.

24:03.138 --> 24:05.653
Please, listen to me!

24:09.674 --> 24:11.833
Do you have power?

24:12.092 --> 24:13.518
I have power.

24:13.575 --> 24:15.894
Does power consent?

24:16.713 --> 24:18.651
Please, stop - just stop this!

24:18.723 --> 24:23.602
If your consent is impure,
it will kill you.

24:23.915 --> 24:25.643
Impure?
What does that mean, impure?

24:25.736 --> 24:29.791
You act out of fear.
Fear is not consent.

24:29.921 --> 24:31.281
Agh!

24:40.751 --> 24:43.670
Planet Earth does not consent
to your help, your presence,

24:43.804 --> 24:45.266
or your conquest.

24:45.354 --> 24:47.393
Thank you for playing
the big pyramid game -

24:47.480 --> 24:49.540
bye-bye, see you again next week,
hopefully not.

24:49.571 --> 24:52.657
Without our help,
Planet Earth is doomed.

24:52.781 --> 24:57.743
Yes, well, it's been doomed before.
Guess what happened?

24:57.953 --> 24:59.273
Me!

25:12.710 --> 25:13.749
What are you doing?

25:13.830 --> 25:15.204
I just need a minute.

25:15.773 --> 25:17.407
I was about to throw up in my suit.

25:17.462 --> 25:18.594
I did that once.

25:18.650 --> 25:19.665
Ugh...

25:29.182 --> 25:30.620
Oh, my God.

25:35.890 --> 25:39.770
OK - whatever that is,
that is not meant to happen.

25:41.730 --> 25:43.319
We need to sort this.

26:04.206 --> 26:06.057
Why do they need consent?

26:06.130 --> 26:07.689
Maybe they're like vampires -

26:07.854 --> 26:09.682
can't come in unless
they're invited.

26:09.769 --> 26:11.159
They're not vampires.

26:11.226 --> 26:13.549
The future we saw, is it the war?

26:13.634 --> 26:15.690
Do we bring that future about?

26:15.929 --> 26:18.260
That would seem to be
the most obvious conclusion.

26:18.438 --> 26:20.221
No. I say, no.

26:20.377 --> 26:22.885
Friend, I will not fight you.

26:22.941 --> 26:24.460
We are just soldiers in the field.

26:24.555 --> 26:26.830
Are we too afraid to disobey?

26:27.156 --> 26:28.556
I'm not.

26:33.805 --> 26:35.245
Neither am I.

26:37.462 --> 26:38.938
This is amazing.

26:39.212 --> 26:41.329
What do you think, Mr President?

26:41.923 --> 26:45.173
Did we just give peace a chance?

26:48.163 --> 26:49.561
The clock.

26:51.018 --> 26:52.358
I'm sorry?

26:52.904 --> 26:54.147
Look at the clock.

26:56.007 --> 26:57.928
Still one minute to midnight.

26:58.311 --> 27:02.038
It made no difference.
How could this make no difference?

27:02.097 --> 27:04.976
Because it's not you
who's going to end the world.

27:05.290 --> 27:06.616
You were never the problem.

27:06.699 --> 27:07.874
Then who is the problem?

27:07.965 --> 27:10.467
Something is happening,
somewhere else.

27:10.901 --> 27:14.975
Somewhere in the world,
in silence or in darkness,

27:15.616 --> 27:17.999
the world is ending right now.

27:18.269 --> 27:20.366
And we have to find out where.

27:23.877 --> 27:26.908
It's gone crazy.
It's much too strong.

27:26.994 --> 27:29.153
It's not just breaking
the root system down,

27:29.217 --> 27:30.924
it's killing the whole thing.

27:31.283 --> 27:32.635
We have to seal off the lab,

27:32.709 --> 27:34.377
the greenhouse, everything.

27:34.511 --> 27:37.010
This can't be allowed to get
into the atmosphere.

27:42.957 --> 27:44.356
This is impossible.

27:44.536 --> 27:46.520
We can't search a whole planet
in a few minutes.

27:46.561 --> 27:47.760
Narrow it down.

27:47.800 --> 27:50.215
They landed the pyramid in
the middle of military crisis -

27:50.261 --> 27:52.036
what was the point of that?

27:53.083 --> 27:54.202
OK, what was the point?

27:54.289 --> 27:55.528
What was the effect?

27:55.662 --> 28:00.083
They told us the world was ending
in a potential war zone.

28:00.166 --> 28:01.762
What did we assume
was going to happen?

28:01.863 --> 28:03.817
World War Three. But it didn't.

28:03.881 --> 28:05.161
The trick with misdirection -

28:05.243 --> 28:07.005
don't look where the arrow
is pointing,

28:07.055 --> 28:08.481
look where it's pointing away from.

28:08.543 --> 28:11.817
So, what's already on our radar,

28:11.872 --> 28:14.372
that we should be worried about
right now?

28:14.459 --> 28:17.005
Forget about war -
what else could end the world?

28:17.131 --> 28:18.250
Bacteria.

28:18.447 --> 28:19.856
I like the sound of that.

28:19.972 --> 28:22.856
New strain of flu? Plague?

28:22.931 --> 28:24.011
People can be immune.

28:24.060 --> 28:26.817
And whatever it is will kill
all life on Earth,

28:26.877 --> 28:30.700
not just humans -
plague discriminates.

28:30.804 --> 28:33.919
So this isn't a plan,
it's a mistake.

28:34.301 --> 28:36.723
Somebody, somewhere,
is doing something

28:36.812 --> 28:39.505
that's about to blow up
in everybody's face.

28:48.223 --> 28:49.528
What are you doing?

28:49.568 --> 28:52.613
The distraction tells us
that whatever's coming

28:52.846 --> 28:55.762
is already on a watchlist.

28:56.036 --> 28:58.598
I just put all the top-secret
intelligence documents

28:58.695 --> 29:01.316
in the world online -
in searchable format.

29:01.341 --> 29:02.460
What?!

29:02.499 --> 29:03.979
Sit down and google.

29:11.366 --> 29:13.812
It's never done anything
like that before.

29:14.152 --> 29:15.499
Check the mix.

29:17.796 --> 29:18.875
Anything?

29:20.273 --> 29:21.625
Douglas?

29:22.793 --> 29:24.031
Douglas!

29:25.404 --> 29:26.684
DOUGLAS?!

29:47.259 --> 29:49.236
- Doctor, listen.
- What?

29:49.294 --> 29:51.580
Isn't it worth at least just
considering doing the deal?

29:51.631 --> 29:53.900
- What deal?
- All we have got to do is consent.

29:53.961 --> 29:56.595
That's what the Secretary-General
thought. They burned him.

29:56.650 --> 29:57.809
He was afraid -

29:57.989 --> 29:59.861
I'm not being afraid,
I'm being smart.

29:59.885 --> 30:00.961
Yeah!

30:00.986 --> 30:03.306
Being smart is not giving
away your planet.

30:03.579 --> 30:06.931
So, an accident,
leading to irrevocable consequences.

30:07.042 --> 30:08.521
I like bacteria.

30:08.732 --> 30:12.087
They can spread - once they're out,
you can't put them away again.

30:12.238 --> 30:14.720
What could they do?
What do you depend on?

30:15.029 --> 30:16.744
Air, water, food, beer.

30:16.820 --> 30:18.814
Air, water and food.

30:18.927 --> 30:20.298
Let's say something's going
to change,

30:20.322 --> 30:22.525
something is going to be released.

30:22.640 --> 30:25.572
Something new, something fast.

30:25.661 --> 30:27.259
I'm feeling...

30:28.048 --> 30:29.517
I'm feeling biochemical.

30:29.706 --> 30:32.072
- Check biochemical trials.
- Yes, sir.

30:32.250 --> 30:33.705
Doctor...

30:34.728 --> 30:38.119
That world was dead a year from now.

30:38.388 --> 30:39.948
We should at least go in there
and talk.

30:39.981 --> 30:44.140
There are about 100,000 biochemical
trials going on right now.

30:44.391 --> 30:46.915
Specifically related to GM bacteria.

30:47.039 --> 30:49.126
Er... 6,000.

30:49.736 --> 30:52.540
How many have reached stage two?
You cannot accept their offer.

30:52.706 --> 30:54.072
Why not?

30:54.255 --> 30:56.290
Because whatever the price is,
it's too high.

30:56.384 --> 30:57.431
We'll work it out.

30:57.460 --> 30:58.736
428.

30:58.855 --> 31:01.330
It's too many, and we don't even
know if you're right.

31:01.381 --> 31:02.728
Well, I probably am.

31:02.823 --> 31:04.220
Probably isn't good enough!

31:04.264 --> 31:05.634
Probably is all you've got.

31:05.724 --> 31:07.883
It's your planet -
I can't just give it away.

31:07.947 --> 31:09.173
You know what, sir?

31:09.302 --> 31:12.205
Finally, you've said
something I agree with.

31:12.591 --> 31:15.716
It's our planet. Our choice.

31:15.787 --> 31:17.067
You can't make a deal with them.

31:17.091 --> 31:18.870
You don't what you're agreeing to.
I don't know.

31:18.894 --> 31:23.224
All I know is I plan on living
to fight another day.

31:23.649 --> 31:27.099
Right now, what we don't have
is a whole lot of other days.

31:27.194 --> 31:28.248
Agreed.

31:28.318 --> 31:29.888
Also agreed.

31:30.669 --> 31:31.909
Doctor...

31:35.447 --> 31:37.847
Is it just possible
that they're right?

31:38.899 --> 31:41.455
Being right is easy. We need to win.

31:42.523 --> 31:43.845
All these soldiers in the room,

31:43.942 --> 31:45.494
and you're the only one
still fighting.

31:45.574 --> 31:48.744
Would you make the deal? Even not
knowing what's going to happen?

31:48.820 --> 31:52.408
Those guys have modelled
every event in human history

31:52.478 --> 31:53.649
to find our weak spot.

31:53.728 --> 31:55.783
Are you going to do the same
in a couple of minutes?

31:55.900 --> 31:57.189
Would you make the deal?

31:57.251 --> 31:59.712
No, not if I had a choice.

32:00.165 --> 32:02.455
But we don't, do we?

32:02.518 --> 32:04.009
It's your world.

32:04.200 --> 32:05.800
Not any more.

32:08.308 --> 32:14.028
OK, back to the pyramid
and negotiate our surrender.

32:20.167 --> 32:21.636
Doctor?

32:22.198 --> 32:23.292
What are you going to do?

32:23.387 --> 32:25.542
Well for a start,
I'm going to tell you the truth.

32:25.652 --> 32:28.081
I've been keeping a secret from you.

32:34.133 --> 32:35.613
Doctor?

32:37.415 --> 32:39.016
We can blind them.

32:39.477 --> 32:42.516
That's how we do it - we blind them!

32:42.836 --> 32:44.422
Blind who? The Monks?

32:44.534 --> 32:46.977
Bill, go to the pyramid.
Keep an eye on them all.

32:47.069 --> 32:49.028
Nardole, with me. To the TARDIS.

32:49.100 --> 32:51.852
- Yes, sir.
- Have you got a plan?

32:52.424 --> 32:54.438
You'll be hearing from me.

32:54.928 --> 32:58.352
'Biohazard. Lab in lockdown.

32:58.840 --> 33:01.479
'Biohazard. Lab in lockdown.'

33:02.801 --> 33:05.852
'Biohazard. Lab in lockdown.'

33:10.515 --> 33:13.742
Oh, Douglas, what have you done?

33:14.123 --> 33:17.375
OK, - there's the list of labs
on the UNIT watch list.

33:17.435 --> 33:21.102
If they're being watched,
that means they've got CCTV cameras,

33:21.334 --> 33:24.086
with feeds to UNIT HQ.

33:24.255 --> 33:25.367
Can you hack them?

33:25.455 --> 33:27.174
Course I can, I'm not JUST sexy.

33:27.253 --> 33:28.742
But there's 428 of them,

33:28.855 --> 33:30.102
we can't watch them all.

33:30.155 --> 33:31.289
Are you following me?

33:31.402 --> 33:33.063
Yeah, I think I get it.

33:33.383 --> 33:35.070
Yes, well, we're not going
to watch them,

33:35.102 --> 33:36.165
we're going to switch 'em off.

33:36.189 --> 33:38.695
Can you do that? What good
would switching them off do?

33:38.781 --> 33:43.461
If... I'm right, the Monks are only
watching one of those labs.

33:43.583 --> 33:44.906
How would they do that?

33:44.971 --> 33:48.690
Well, I suppose
they'd just... hack the cameras.

33:48.778 --> 33:50.188
So switch them off.

33:56.404 --> 33:59.016
OK, so, we've blinded them.

33:59.290 --> 34:01.344
But whatever's happening
is still happening.

34:01.441 --> 34:03.430
Yep. And the Monks are powerful -

34:03.498 --> 34:05.922
they can just turn the cameras
back on.

34:06.010 --> 34:07.235
Yes, they can -

34:07.314 --> 34:09.710
but they're only watching one lab.

34:09.842 --> 34:14.063
So all we need to know is
which lab just got its cameras back?

34:17.739 --> 34:19.694
Oh, you genius!

34:20.840 --> 34:22.146
Boom!

34:30.748 --> 34:31.860
Oh, my God!

34:31.935 --> 34:33.462
No, I'm the Doctor,

34:33.731 --> 34:35.679
but it's an easy mistake to make,
the eyebrows.

34:35.757 --> 34:37.601
How did you do that?
What is that thing?

34:37.658 --> 34:39.571
It's Nardole - he's not my fault.

34:39.713 --> 34:42.563
Back to the TARDIS,
this place is toxic. I'm not human.

34:42.759 --> 34:44.601
You're human enough,
I got your lungs cheap.

34:44.672 --> 34:46.422
Oh, now he tells me...!

34:46.743 --> 34:48.688
Park her close, monitor me.

34:48.969 --> 34:51.071
Oh, tidy up your room.

34:54.286 --> 34:55.766
You have a problem, I believe.

34:55.844 --> 34:57.255
Who the hell are you?

34:57.311 --> 34:58.763
Don't be alarmed,
we don't have time.

34:58.864 --> 35:00.904
Just jump straight
to all the explaining.

35:23.114 --> 35:24.273
It's the Doctor.

35:24.313 --> 35:27.153
'OK found it, lab in Yorkshire.'

35:27.223 --> 35:30.083
Long story, short -
misplaced decimal point,

35:30.195 --> 35:31.834
resulting in a bacteria

35:31.930 --> 35:35.231
that turns any living thing
it touches into gunk.

35:35.327 --> 35:37.060
So why is it going to end the world?

35:37.130 --> 35:38.505
'Has it been dispersed already?'

35:38.594 --> 35:40.313
Ah, no, it's still in the lab.

35:40.501 --> 35:41.940
I think I can contain it.

35:42.012 --> 35:44.974
We give him two minutes
and we're heading in. Agreed?

35:45.773 --> 35:46.957
Agreed.

35:47.099 --> 35:50.231
We have an air filtration system
to take toxins out of the air.

35:50.318 --> 35:52.317
It runs a cycle every 30 minutes.

35:52.435 --> 35:54.794
It's going to pump the bacteria
into the atmosphere.

35:54.981 --> 35:56.161
So switch it off.

35:56.263 --> 35:58.342
- I can't.
- Oh.

35:58.530 --> 36:00.169
Right, OK. When's the next cycle?

36:00.251 --> 36:02.611
- 20 minutes.
- What?!

36:06.325 --> 36:08.575
Anything?
'The venting system is automatic.'

36:08.670 --> 36:10.302
This is going to be trickier
than I thought.

36:14.276 --> 36:15.590
We're going in.

36:18.290 --> 36:21.618
Think. Think, think, think, think.
Stupid Doctor.

36:21.730 --> 36:23.130
Stupid, stupid, stupid...

36:24.250 --> 36:27.049
Handsome Doctor.

36:27.190 --> 36:31.852
Adorable, hugely intelligent,
but still approachable Doctor.

36:34.455 --> 36:36.440
What's another way to destroy
bacteria?

36:36.509 --> 36:39.299
- Sterilisation.
- And how do you sterilise something?

36:39.446 --> 36:40.861
Put it in boiling water.

36:41.039 --> 36:43.619
Or? Put it in a flame.

36:44.553 --> 36:45.963
She's got it.

36:47.643 --> 36:49.713
By George, she's got it!

36:50.010 --> 36:51.329
I'm not going to lie to you,

36:51.486 --> 36:52.777
this means that
your insurance premiums

36:52.801 --> 36:53.870
are going to go through the roof.

36:53.894 --> 36:55.336
In fact, everything is going
to go through the roof,

36:55.360 --> 36:57.572
because I'm going to blow up
the lab.

36:58.197 --> 37:00.900
We just need some kind
of a trigger, first.

37:00.997 --> 37:03.408
But what are you going
to blow it up with?

37:04.959 --> 37:06.999
The bacteria is making ethanol!

37:07.140 --> 37:09.059
The greenhouse and the lab
are full of it!

37:09.114 --> 37:11.514
Seriously, what are you doing
when this is all over?

37:14.309 --> 37:15.793
We're ready to talk.

37:23.391 --> 37:25.391
Do you have power?

37:25.547 --> 37:28.146
Well, right now, we're representing
the three biggest armies

37:28.211 --> 37:31.375
on the planet, so I guess we do.

37:32.217 --> 37:34.578
Does power consent?

37:34.930 --> 37:36.367
We consent.

37:37.225 --> 37:40.921
If your consent is impure,
it will kill you.

37:42.221 --> 37:45.409
I surrender. We surrender.

37:45.825 --> 37:47.185
What more do you want?

37:48.973 --> 37:52.172
To rule, there must be love.

37:52.432 --> 37:56.591
Your consent must be pure.

38:00.845 --> 38:06.321
You act out of strategy.
Strategy is not consent.

38:06.401 --> 38:08.009
Ah!

38:14.480 --> 38:16.425
Do you consent?

38:16.570 --> 38:19.418
I don't have any power. I'm nobody.

38:19.711 --> 38:24.144
You represent
the greatest power on the planet.

38:24.319 --> 38:27.425
You represent the Doctor.

38:27.839 --> 38:31.605
Is your consent pure?

38:34.436 --> 38:35.647
Is this going to work?

38:35.698 --> 38:38.817
Trust me. I pop it in there.
Machine goes ping.

38:38.928 --> 38:40.545
Lab goes boom. World is saved.

38:40.608 --> 38:43.483
You develop a pretty intense crush
on me.

38:44.025 --> 38:46.299
OK. Go through to the machine room.

38:46.384 --> 38:48.585
You're going to have to let me
back in when I'm done.

38:48.664 --> 38:50.290
How long before the vents kick in?

38:50.341 --> 38:51.830
Four minutes.

38:52.186 --> 38:53.557
Doctor, you still there?

38:53.683 --> 38:55.768
There's no way of stopping
the lab venting,

38:55.890 --> 38:58.236
so I'm going to sterilise
the building by blowing it up.

38:58.322 --> 38:59.807
Everything in here
will be destroyed.

38:59.918 --> 39:02.283
- Including you?
- Not if I pull my socks up.

39:02.378 --> 39:04.690
Honest answer. You going to do it?

39:04.780 --> 39:05.940
Course I'm going to do it.

39:06.010 --> 39:08.893
Because they're still
offering a deal, and...

39:09.460 --> 39:10.899
And I'm the only one left.

39:10.963 --> 39:13.127
Tell them you're flattered
but don't.

39:13.619 --> 39:16.330
What does consent mean?

39:16.886 --> 39:20.221
You must ask for our help,
and want it,

39:20.368 --> 39:23.205
and know you will then be ours.

39:23.322 --> 39:26.541
Only then can the link be formed.

39:27.434 --> 39:28.673
What link?

39:28.806 --> 39:31.213
Do you consent?

39:40.908 --> 39:42.188
Can you hear me?

39:45.141 --> 39:46.688
I don't even know your name.

39:46.771 --> 39:48.011
Erica.

39:51.687 --> 39:54.046
Did you always want to be
a scientist, Erica?

39:54.290 --> 39:55.648
Since I was about eight.

39:55.813 --> 39:57.772
Before that, I wanted to be
a bus driver,

39:57.930 --> 40:00.976
because I liked how they waved
at other bus drivers.

40:02.653 --> 40:04.406
OK. I've given us two minutes.

40:04.610 --> 40:06.812
Right, you need to get out of there!

40:21.002 --> 40:24.463
Hello, I'm the Doctor, saving
the world with my eyes shut.

40:38.775 --> 40:41.329
Doctor - the clock's going back.
Have you done it?

40:41.374 --> 40:42.384
Yes, I have!

40:42.414 --> 40:45.947
I'm totally the President of Earth,
and from now on, two planes!

40:46.055 --> 40:49.626
One for me and one for my glamorous
assistant, Erica.

40:49.760 --> 40:53.279
Say hello to the folks at home,
Erica, and let me through the door.

40:53.421 --> 40:55.806
'Bill, get the hell
out of that pyramid!'

41:03.048 --> 41:06.602
I can't open it.
It's under emergency protocol.

41:06.896 --> 41:08.758
You need to use
the combination lock.

41:08.843 --> 41:11.508
Set it to 3614.

41:27.232 --> 41:28.553
You're going to have to guide me.

41:28.674 --> 41:31.913
I can't see it from here -
you can see it, right?

41:32.233 --> 41:33.574
How long have I got?

41:33.645 --> 41:34.709
One minute 40.

41:34.753 --> 41:36.592
3614.

41:36.617 --> 41:37.644
Come on.

41:37.726 --> 41:39.490
Doctor, what's happening, you OK?

41:39.615 --> 41:41.326
Bill - sorry, slight hitch,
working on it.

41:41.351 --> 41:42.411
What's the problem?

41:42.436 --> 41:45.217
3614 - need it to open the door,
but I can't see the numbers.

41:45.328 --> 41:47.069
One minute, 20.

41:48.530 --> 41:50.088
I don't understand the problem.

41:50.137 --> 41:52.844
Combination lock - all the sonic
will do is calculate the number,

41:52.869 --> 41:54.345
I still have to enter it.

41:55.436 --> 41:58.873
Nardole! Nardole! Nardole!

41:59.079 --> 42:00.865
I need you to do a visual
on the lab,

42:00.961 --> 42:02.530
there's a camera in here.

42:04.175 --> 42:08.725
Nardole? Nardole, can you hear me?

42:09.088 --> 42:11.694
I don't understand the problem.
Just open the door.

42:11.718 --> 42:12.819
I can't.

42:12.850 --> 42:13.850
Why can't you?

42:13.910 --> 42:15.420
Because I'm blind.

42:16.576 --> 42:18.256
I'm sorry. I'm blind.

42:19.428 --> 42:22.248
What do you mean, blind?
What are you talking about?

42:22.496 --> 42:26.576
I lied.
I've been blind since Chasm Forge.

42:26.865 --> 42:29.069
I didn't get my sight back.
I've been lying to you.

42:29.179 --> 42:34.217
There's a combination lock,
with numbers, and I can't see them.

42:35.459 --> 42:37.319
You're an idiot...

42:37.404 --> 42:39.684
You are the stupidest idiot ever!

42:43.803 --> 42:45.701
But I'm not going to let you die.

42:45.858 --> 42:49.365
No. You have to, there's no choice.

42:49.804 --> 42:51.271
No-one else can help me now.

42:51.361 --> 42:53.888
The Monks. The Monks can help you.

42:54.096 --> 42:56.420
No! Bill, no! Don't do that!

42:56.610 --> 42:57.771
I'm sorry.

42:57.876 --> 43:00.240
I made a mistake -
I have to face that -

43:00.373 --> 43:02.573
but do not ask the Monks for help!

43:05.667 --> 43:06.862
Bill!

43:07.296 --> 43:08.415
Doctor.

43:08.558 --> 43:13.175
This planet needs you.
So I'm making an executive decision.

43:13.675 --> 43:15.003
'I'm keeping you alive.'

43:15.054 --> 43:17.308
Bill, listen to me, please.

43:17.683 --> 43:20.480
I don't know what consenting
allows them to do to you!

43:20.627 --> 43:22.917
'You don't know what
you're agreeing to!'

43:23.090 --> 43:25.073
Can you give him his sight back?

43:28.336 --> 43:32.370
His sight can be restored.

43:32.708 --> 43:35.448
Then, then I'm asking you for help.

43:36.600 --> 43:37.800
I'm giving my consent.

43:37.841 --> 43:40.519
Is your consent pure?

43:41.283 --> 43:43.322
Just give him his sight back!

43:43.462 --> 43:46.175
You can have the world -
just make him see again.

43:47.532 --> 43:49.073
I consent.

43:56.426 --> 43:58.926
You act out of love.

43:59.447 --> 44:04.691
Love is consent.
We must be loved.

44:04.784 --> 44:07.598
Bill! Do not make this deal!
I forbid it!

44:09.966 --> 44:15.997
Bill, can you hear me?
What's happening? Bill? Bill?

44:51.743 --> 44:53.720
Bill, what have you done?

44:55.071 --> 44:59.579
I'll tell you what, old man,
you'd better get my planet back!

44:59.738 --> 45:06.891
Enjoy your sight, Doctor.
Now see our world.

45:37.648 --> 45:41.167
I woke up and the Monks were here
and they've always been here.

45:41.575 --> 45:44.438
All that we believe now is a lie.

45:44.469 --> 45:45.532
I want to speak to her.

45:45.579 --> 45:47.778
All you have to do is find
whoever opened the door to

45:47.841 --> 45:49.440
the Monks and just kill them.

45:49.645 --> 45:52.594
