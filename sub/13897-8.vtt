JAKE.

00:16.050 --> 00:17.220
YUP.

00:19.140 --> 00:20.640
[LESLIE]
I HAD TO PUT YOU IN JAIL.

00:21.980 --> 00:24.150
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE IN JAIL.

00:24.190 --> 00:25.360
NO ONE KNOWS I'M GONE.

00:27.150 --> 00:29.110
I KNOW YOU DIDN'T
DO IT, JAKE.

00:29.940 --> 00:31.530
BUT I HAD
TO PUT YOU IN JAIL.

00:33.280 --> 00:35.620
I'M REALLY SORRY ABOUT THIS.

00:36.910 --> 00:39.240
SOMETIMES YOU HAVE
TO GET YOUR HANDS DIRTY.

00:40.580 --> 00:41.910
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.

00:51.460 --> 00:52.760
&lt;GUNSHOT&gt;

00:59.350 --> 01:00.890
OH, MY GOD.

01:00.930 --> 01:02.560
OH, MY GOD, JAKE.

01:04.310 --> 01:05.900
NO, NO, NO.

01:05.940 --> 01:07.270
JAKE, GET UP!

01:08.020 --> 01:09.610
&lt;BABY CRYING&gt;

01:11.070 --> 01:12.150
CAN YOU HEAR THAT?

01:14.150 --> 01:15.160
WHERE IS IT?

01:17.160 --> 01:18.950
IT'S YOUR PHONE.

01:18.990 --> 01:20.620
IT'S RINGING.
IS THAT YOUR PHONE?

01:24.540 --> 01:25.750
I'VE ALWAYS LOVED YOU.

01:25.790 --> 01:27.130
-&lt;CELL PHONE RINGING&gt;
-&lt;GASPS&gt;

01:34.920 --> 01:36.050
BENNETT.

01:36.090 --> 01:37.260
&lt;POLICE SIRENS WAILING&gt;

01:37.300 --> 01:38.340

01:44.680 --> 01:46.390

01:46.440 --> 01:48.150
A KIDNAPPING. GIRL, 21,

01:48.190 --> 01:50.690
THEY SNATCHED HER

THE BACKYARD.

01:50.730 --> 01:52.570
THAT'S THE BOYFRIEND,
SMITH CARSON.

01:52.610 --> 01:54.990
GUY'S A SUSPECTED
DRUG DEALER,
BUT WE'VE NEVER

01:55.030 --> 01:56.780
BEEN ABLE TO GET
HIM ON ANYTHING.

01:56.820 --> 01:59.160
UH, THERE WERE
TWO KIDNAPPERS,
MASKS, GUNS,

01:59.200 --> 02:01.280
THE USUAL, A WOMAN
AND THIS GUY.

02:02.660 --> 02:05.370
SHE SHOT HER OWN
PARTNER ON THE WAY OUT.

02:05.410 --> 02:08.120
LESLIE, LISTEN, MAYBE YOU
SHOULD SIT OUT.

02:08.920 --> 02:10.080
WHY?

02:18.090 --> 02:19.180
NO, WAIT.
THEY'RE NOT DONE.

02:19.220 --> 02:21.010
I HAVEN'T EVEN GOTTEN IN

04:06.530 --> 04:08.330
THAT'S IT, JAKE, B'Y,
I KNEW YOU COULD DO IT.

04:08.370 --> 04:09.500
I KNEW IT.

04:09.540 --> 04:10.790
NOW COME ON, WE GETS
OUT OF HERE

04:10.830 --> 04:12.370

BIG BROTHER SHOWS UP.

04:12.420 --> 04:13.540
HE'S GOT A BIGGER BROTHER?

04:14.170 --> 04:15.420
[LESLIE] DOYLE!

04:17.170 --> 04:19.130
I NEED TO TALK
TO YOU. NOW.

04:20.300 --> 04:21.970
HEY THERE, UH, LESLIE. I...

04:24.390 --> 04:26.350
&lt;INMATES LAUGHING&gt;

04:29.970 --> 04:32.020
&lt;SIREN WAILING&gt;

04:32.060 --> 04:33.390
[LESLIE] SO YOU'VE NEVER
SEEN HIM BEFORE?

04:33.850 --> 04:35.310
NO. NEVER.

04:36.610 --> 04:37.730
IDENTITY THEFT.

04:37.770 --> 04:39.530
HE'S BEEN LIVING AS YOU
FOR THREE WEEKS,

04:39.570 --> 04:40.900
EVER SINCE YOU'VE
BEEN LOCKED UP.

04:41.400 --> 04:42.490
HE'S BEEN LIVING AS ME?

04:42.530 --> 04:43.570
I DON'T EVEN WANT TO BE ME.

04:43.610 --> 04:44.660
WHY WOULD HE DO THAT?

04:44.700 --> 04:46.280
LOOK, I KNOW
YOU GOT A BAD RAP,

04:46.320 --> 04:47.580
BUT YOU DIDN'T REALLY
ROB THAT BANK.

04:47.620 --> 04:49.370
I KNOW THIS,
BUT I CAN'T PROVE IT.

04:49.410 --> 04:51.000
IT IS WHAT IT IS, LESLIE.

04:51.040 --> 04:53.660
I... I... I DON'T BLAME YOU
FOR ANY OF THAT.

04:53.710 --> 04:54.870
HOWEVER,
I THINK THERE'S A WAY

04:54.920 --> 04:55.960
FOR YOU TO GET
A SECOND CHANCE

04:56.000 --> 04:57.500
TO HELP YOUR APPEAL.

04:58.250 --> 04:59.630
A GIRL'S BEEN KIDNAPPED.

04:59.670 --> 05:02.090
OKAY, SO YOU GUYS
WANT ME TO HELP YOU.

05:02.130 --> 05:04.760
I GET THAT, BUT WHOSE IDEA
WAS THIS WHOLE THING?

05:08.390 --> 05:09.560
WELL, LOOK AT HIMSELF,

05:09.600 --> 05:10.720
DRESSED TO THE NINES.

05:12.560 --> 05:13.690
SERGEANT BENNETT,
YOU GAVE HIM THE INFO?

05:14.440 --> 05:15.980
WE'RE IN THE PROCESS, SIR.

05:16.020 --> 05:17.900
DID YOU JUST
CALL HIM "SIR"?

05:17.940 --> 05:21.440
RIGHT, UH, YOU WOULDN'T
HAVE HEARD IN PRISON.

05:21.480 --> 05:23.820
HOOD IS OFFICIALLY
STAFF SERGEANT,

05:23.860 --> 05:25.360
EFFECTIVE TODAY.

05:25.400 --> 05:26.450
I SHOULD'VE KNOWN.

05:26.490 --> 05:27.490
NOTHING SAYS A PROMOTION

05:27.530 --> 05:29.620
LIKE A BRAND NEW SUIT FROM
RANDY RIVER. &lt;CLICKS TONGUE&gt;

05:29.660 --> 05:33.450
THIS WHOLE IDEA, YOUR RELEASE,
IT'S MY OPERATION.

05:33.500 --> 05:34.660
I PLAN TO
MAKE THIS WORK,

05:34.710 --> 05:36.120
SO WATCH YOURSELF.

05:36.170 --> 05:39.000
OH, THIS IS ALL YOUR
BIG... YOUR BIG PLAN.

05:39.040 --> 05:40.380
THAT MAKES SENSE. WOW.

05:41.550 --> 05:44.510
ANYWAY, THIS GUY
PRETENDING TO BE YOU?

05:44.550 --> 05:46.800
HE WAS CONNECTED
TO A KIDNAPPING.

05:46.840 --> 05:48.720
FIONA MICHAELS WAS
ALL SET TO TESTIFY

05:48.760 --> 05:52.350
AGAINST HER DRUG
DEALER BOYFRIEND,
BUT SHE DISAPPEARED.

05:52.390 --> 05:54.100
WE CAN'T LOSE THIS WITNESS.

05:54.140 --> 05:55.890
THE CROWN'S CASE
DEPENDS ON IT.

05:55.940 --> 05:59.360
WE HAVE A PRIME SUSPECT,
AUDREY BURCHILL.

05:59.400 --> 06:01.520
BUT IT'S BEEN 12 HOURS AND WE
HAVEN'T HEARD ANYTHING.

06:01.570 --> 06:02.610
NO RANSOM YET.

06:02.650 --> 06:05.070
HOW DO WE KNOW THAT,
UH, FIONA HERE ISN'T DEAD?

06:05.740 --> 06:06.950
WE DON'T.

06:06.990 --> 06:08.530
BUT AUDREY USED
TO HAVE A PARTNER

06:08.570 --> 06:10.320
WHO IS SERVING 10 YEARS.

06:10.370 --> 06:13.370
-YEAH, HOOD'S GOT ANOTHER
CON WORKING WITH US.
-&lt;DOOR OPENING&gt;

06:15.960 --> 06:18.620
JAKE, MEET LOGAN HICKS.

06:18.670 --> 06:20.130
HI.

06:20.170 --> 06:22.170
BENNETT, JAKE,

06:22.210 --> 06:23.670
I'LL BE WATCHING REAL CLOSE.

06:24.670 --> 06:25.590
DON'T SCREW UP.

06:26.670 --> 06:27.880
&lt;DOOR OPENING&gt;

06:33.890 --> 06:36.270
[MAL] SO NOW
JAKE'S WORKING SOME
CASE WITH LESLIE.

06:36.310 --> 06:37.600
I'M GONNA TRY
TO MEET UP WITH HIM.

06:37.640 --> 06:38.810
REALLY? HE'S OUT?

06:38.850 --> 06:40.270
APPARENTLY SO.

06:40.310 --> 06:41.610
I GOT A FEELING THINGS MIGHT

06:41.650 --> 06:43.480
GO BACK TO NORMAL
AROUND HERE.

06:43.520 --> 06:44.650
THAT SOUNDS INSANE.

06:44.690 --> 06:45.530
&lt;BOTH CHUCKLE&gt;

06:45.570 --> 06:46.610
&lt;BABY COOING&gt;

07:00.580 --> 07:03.420
UH, CAN WE HELP YOU?

07:03.460 --> 07:08.470
HI. UH, SORRY, I, UM,
I JUST HAD TO LET MYSELF IN.

07:08.510 --> 07:10.260
UH, WHO ARE YOU, DEAR?

07:10.760 --> 07:12.350
I WAS LOOKING FOR JAKE.

07:13.220 --> 07:14.640
HE NEEDS TO MEET
HIS DAUGHTER.

07:15.560 --> 07:16.640
&lt;BABY FUSSING&gt;

07:20.560 --> 07:22.770
SO HOOD'S THE NEW BOSS, HUH?
THAT MUST BE A LAUGH.

07:23.270 --> 07:24.570
DROP IT.

07:24.610 --> 07:28.860
YOU SHOULD SHAVE YOUR
HEAD AS A... A SIGN OF
SOLIDARITY.

07:28.900 --> 07:32.740
LOGAN, OUR PRIME SUSPECT,
AUDREY, WHAT'S YOUR
STORY WITH HER?

07:32.780 --> 07:34.700
WE PULLED A NUMBER OF JOBS
TOGETHER. KIDNAPPINGS.

07:34.740 --> 07:37.290
-MADE GOOD MONEY.
-MANLY WORK.

07:37.330 --> 07:38.750
WE ALWAYS CHOSE
THE WEALTHY SUBJECTS,

07:38.790 --> 07:40.670
STRONG GUYS.
YOU KNOW, HEALTHY?

07:40.710 --> 07:41.870
NO ONE EVER GOT HURT.

07:41.920 --> 07:44.130
YEAH, WELL, FIONA MICHAELS
ISN'T WEALTHY.

07:44.170 --> 07:46.880
AND SHE WAS ABOUT TO
TESTIFY IN A DANGEROUS
DRUG CASE.

07:48.050 --> 07:50.340
YOU EVER WORK FOR ANY
DRUG DEALERS, LOGAN?

07:50.380 --> 07:52.510
-DID AUDREY?
-NO.

07:52.550 --> 07:54.350
OUR FIRST STOP IS
FIONA'S BOYFRIEND,

07:54.390 --> 07:55.720
THE DEALER, SMITH CARSON.

07:55.760 --> 07:57.220
YEAH, YEAH, I KNOW...
I KNOW WHO HE IS.

08:01.770 --> 08:03.350
HOOD MUST BE
PRETTY DESPERATE.

08:03.400 --> 08:05.190
I MEAN, GETTING THE HELP
OF TWO CONS.

08:05.230 --> 08:06.940
I KNOW, IT'S A STUPID IDEA.

08:06.980 --> 08:08.320
BUT A WOMAN'S LIFE
IS AT STAKE,

08:08.360 --> 08:11.360
AS WELL AS A CASE AGAINST
A DANGEROUS DRUG PEDDLER.

08:11.400 --> 08:13.530
PLUS, LOGAN'S SENTENCE
IS UP IN A MONTH.

08:13.570 --> 08:14.620
IT'S HARDLY A RISK.

08:14.660 --> 08:16.990
-&lt;SNAPS FINGERS&gt;
-YOU KNOW,
IF THIS WORKS OUT,

08:17.030 --> 08:18.740
HOOD MAY END UP AS CHIEF.

08:18.790 --> 08:20.410
ARE YOU LOOKING
FOR A SMACK?

08:20.450 --> 08:21.710
LET'S GO.

08:24.750 --> 08:27.170
FOLLOW MY LEAD,
AND DO EXACTLY AS I SAY.

08:27.210 --> 08:29.760
DO NOT REVEAL ANYTHING
ABOUT FIONA'S PLANS
TO TESTIFY.

08:29.800 --> 08:31.590
-&lt;PHONE RINGING&gt;
-LOOK, I KNOW
THE ROUTINE, OKAY?

08:31.630 --> 08:32.930
IT'S CHUCKLES HERE YOU
GOTTA WORRY ABOUT.

08:32.970 --> 08:35.930
LOOK, LOGAN, IF YOU
SEE OR HEAR ANYTHING
THAT CAN HELP,

08:35.970 --> 08:37.600
YOU SIGNAL ME, YOU GOT IT?

08:37.640 --> 08:39.560
WHATEVER YOU SAY,
BOSS-LADY.

08:39.600 --> 08:41.600
-BENNETT.
-AH, LESLIE!

08:41.640 --> 08:43.350
CAN I SPEAK
TO JAKE PLEASE?

08:43.390 --> 08:45.060
WHAT AM I, YOUR
ANSWERING SERVICE NOW?

08:45.100 --> 08:46.560
IT'S FOR ME? WELL...

08:47.440 --> 08:48.900
I'M SURE IT'S IMPORTANT.

08:48.940 --> 08:50.740
YEAH, DON'T MAKE IT
A HABIT.

08:50.780 --> 08:53.240
-HELLO?
-YOU HAVE A SERIOUS PROBLEM.

08:53.280 --> 08:56.070
OH, COME ON, MAN,
WHAT IS THIS? HE'S TAKING
PHONE CALLS?

08:56.120 --> 08:57.620
-SCREW THIS.
-PROBLEM?

08:57.660 --> 08:58.660
LOGAN!

08:58.700 --> 09:00.330
LOOK, DAD, THE ONLY PROBLEM
I CAN DEAL WITH RIGHT NOW

09:00.370 --> 09:02.000
IS FINDING THIS
KIDNAPPED GIRL, OKAY?

09:02.040 --> 09:03.290
I ONLY GOT ONE SHOT
AT THIS THING.

09:03.330 --> 09:04.870
WHAT THE HELL DO YOU
THINK YOU'RE DOING?

09:04.920 --> 09:06.040
CAN'T SCREW IT UP.

09:06.080 --> 09:07.460
I THINK THIS MIGHT BE
AN EXCEPTION.

09:07.500 --> 09:08.590
-I GOTTA GO.
-[MAL] JAKE?

09:08.630 --> 09:10.590
[LESLIE] LOGAN HICKS,
GET BACK HERE!

09:11.760 --> 09:12.800
LOGAN!

09:13.760 --> 09:15.720
LOGAN, DON'T EVEN
THINK ABOUT IT.

09:18.350 --> 09:20.470
SHOULDN'T YOU BE
OUT LOOKING FOR MY
KIDNAPPED GIRLFRIEND?

09:20.510 --> 09:23.230
JUST SHUT UP, ALL RIGHT?
WE GOTTA ASK YOU
A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS.

09:24.060 --> 09:25.270
YOU RECOGNIZE THIS GUY?

09:25.310 --> 09:27.770
OBVIOUSLY. HE WAS DEAD
ON MY LAWN LAST NIGHT.

09:27.810 --> 09:29.230
SO YOU SAW HIS FACE?

09:29.270 --> 09:30.860
I'M THINKING THAT'S
WHAT GOT HIM KILLED.

09:30.900 --> 09:34.320
HIS MASK FELL OFF SO
THE CRAZY CHICK SHOT HIM.

09:34.360 --> 09:37.070
MR. CARSON, DO YOU KNOW
ANYONE WHO WOULD WANT
TO HURT FIONA?

09:37.110 --> 09:38.570
A CO-WORKER OR ANYTHING?

09:38.620 --> 09:40.530
OW! WHAT IS THIS? JAKE!

09:41.870 --> 09:43.410
&lt;BANGING ON DOOR&gt;

09:44.460 --> 09:46.000
-LOGAN...
-SHUT UP!

09:46.040 --> 09:47.750
-ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND?
-[LESLIE] YOU LET ME OUT!

09:48.420 --> 09:49.590
-JAKE!
-&lt;GUNSHOTS&gt;

09:51.090 --> 09:55.510
LESLIE! JUST...
JUST STOP SHOOTING, OKAY?
HOLD YOUR FIRE!

09:55.550 --> 09:57.550
[LESLIE] YOU LET ME OUT NOW!

09:57.590 --> 09:59.800
YOU IDIOT. YOU'RE GOING
TO RUIN THIS WHOLE THING.

09:59.850 --> 10:01.350
YOU LET HER OUT,
AND THEY'LL BE FINDING...

10:01.390 --> 10:03.140
-[LESLIE] JAKE!
-...TWO MORE BODIES
ON THIS LAWN.

10:03.180 --> 10:06.390

10:17.070 --> 10:18.660

10:18.700 --> 10:22.240
WELL, I WANT TO LET YOU
OUT, BUT HE'S GOT
A GUN POINTED AT ME.

10:22.280 --> 10:23.490

TO TESTIFY AGAINST YOU

10:25.830 --> 10:27.870

HAD HER GRABBED.

10:27.920 --> 10:29.790
LOGAN, WHAT THE HELL

A PIECE OF DOG TURD.

10:37.090 --> 10:38.680
SHE WAS TESTIFYING
AGAINST YOU.

10:38.720 --> 10:41.220
LOOK, FIONA AND I HAD
OUR PROBLEMS,

-WHERE IS SHE?
-IF I KNEW WHO KIDNAPPED HER,
THEY'D BE DEAD. BELIEVE ME.

10:50.020 --> 10:53.270

TO KNOW THAT FIONA
WAS GOING TO TESTIFY

11:09.710 --> 11:11.170
AGAINST HIM, YOU MORON.

11:11.210 --> 11:12.840

LIKE, "IF PEOPLE COME IN

11:38.860 --> 11:39.780
"AND TAKE OVER OUR BASE

11:39.820 --> 11:41.910
"WHAT DO WE DO?"

12:24.820 --> 12:25.990
I NEVER SAW HIM BEFORE.

12:26.030 --> 12:28.080

LIKE THREE WEEKS AGO.

12:28.120 --> 12:30.370
YEAH, YEAH, AND HE REALLY
RAN UP YOUR LINE OF
CREDIT, MAN.

12:30.410 --> 12:32.000

THEY'RE USING IT
AS A GARAGE.
SO MAYBE HE JUST LOVES

12:52.060 --> 12:53.890
GETTING HIS TIRES ALIGNED.

12:53.940 --> 12:55.560
AUDREY'S HIDING OUT
THERE, I KNOW IT.

14:19.480 --> 14:21.400
DAD, I AM IN THE MIDDLE
OF SOMETHING, ALL RIGHT?

14:21.440 --> 14:23.570
CAN WE NOT FOCUS ON
YOUR ISSUES JUST FOR ONCE?

14:23.610 --> 14:25.070
MY ISSUES?
NO, NO, NO, NO.

14:25.110 --> 14:26.150

14:30.160 --> 14:31.120
HELLO THERE.

14:31.160 --> 14:33.620
YOU LEFT ME IN A SHED
AND YOU GOT MY PHONE.

14:33.660 --> 14:35.750

14:35.790 --> 14:37.920
OH, IS... IS THAT LESLIE?

14:37.960 --> 14:39.960
WHERE IS HE, JAKE?
DON'T MESS WITH ME.

14:40.000 --> 14:41.750
LOGAN'S UP TO SOMETHING.
I CAN FEEL IT.

14:41.790 --> 14:43.550
I JUST DON'T KNOW
EXACTLY WHAT IT IS.

14:43.590 --> 14:45.920
YEAH, BESIDES A JAIL BREAK?
LISTEN, IF I DON'T GET YOU

14:45.960 --> 14:48.050
BACK IN CUSTODY AND FIND
FIONA MICHAELS,

14:48.090 --> 14:49.470
I'M GONNA LOSE
MY JOB HERE.

14:49.510 --> 14:53.010
THAT'S NOT
GONNA HAPPEN, OKAY?
HE DID GET AWAY FROM ME,

14:53.060 --> 14:54.720
BUT I... I... I THINK I KNOW
WHERE HE'S GOING.

14:54.770 --> 14:57.100
LISTEN, JAKE, YOU STAY
PUT UNTIL I COME GET YOU,

14:57.140 --> 14:59.140
THEN YOU'RE
GOING BACK INSIDE.
DO YOU HEAR ME?

14:59.190 --> 15:01.310
UH, NO, NO, NO. NO, NO.
LESLIE, I CAN'T DO THAT.

15:01.360 --> 15:03.270

15:03.320 --> 15:05.400

PLEASE DON'T KILL ME.

15:05.440 --> 15:07.900
JAKE, YOU DON'T GO
ANYWHERE! JAKE?

15:11.200 --> 15:14.410
HER NAME'S JACKLYN.
WE WOULD HAVE
NAMED HER JACOB,

15:14.450 --> 15:16.200
YOU KNOW,
IF SHE WERE A BOY.

15:16.250 --> 15:18.830
-RIGHT. OH, SHE'S BEAUTIFUL.
-THANK YOU.

15:20.040 --> 15:21.210
I, UH...

15:22.540 --> 15:24.960
I JUST HOPE SHE GETS
TO KNOW HER FATHER.

15:25.000 --> 15:27.050
YOU KNOW?
IT'S NOT RIGHT FOR ANYONE
TO GROW UP NOT KNOWING

15:27.090 --> 15:29.170
ANYTHING ABOUT
THEIR REAL DAD.

15:29.220 --> 15:31.010
WAS THAT JAKE?
DID YOU TELL HIM?

15:31.050 --> 15:32.850
-HE JUST
HUNG UP ON ME AGAIN.
-&lt;SIGHS&gt;

15:32.890 --> 15:34.100
IS HE COMING OVER?

15:34.140 --> 15:37.470
HE WILL, YES, BUT, UH...

15:37.520 --> 15:41.060
FIRST, WHY DON'T YOU
EXPLAIN TO ME EXACTLY
HOW IT IS YOU KNOW MY SON.

15:52.160 --> 15:53.700
&lt;CELL PHONE RINGING&gt;

15:57.040 --> 15:58.660
&lt;DOOR CREAKING&gt;

16:04.130 --> 16:05.840
SORRY, LOGAN.
I OWE YOU THIS.

16:08.210 --> 16:10.050
YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT YOU'RE
DOING, YOU MORON!

16:10.090 --> 16:11.930
&lt;YELLS&gt;

16:11.970 --> 16:15.180
LISTEN, MAN,
WE LOST THE TRUST
IN THIS RELATIONSHIP

16:15.220 --> 16:17.430
WHEN YOU THREW
LESLIE BENNETT IN A SHED.

16:17.470 --> 16:18.640
&lt;GRUNTS&gt;

16:18.680 --> 16:20.640
THIS IS A LIFE
OR DEATH SITUATION.

16:20.680 --> 16:22.600
I CAN'T AFFORD TO HAVE
YOU GET IN MY WAY.

16:22.640 --> 16:24.650
LOGAN. WHAT IS THIS?

16:24.690 --> 16:26.020
AUDREY! AUDREY, NO!

16:27.070 --> 16:28.400
EASY. EASY, NOW.

16:28.440 --> 16:30.110
LET HER GO, AUDREY.
I MEAN IT.

16:30.150 --> 16:31.570
THIS WAS NOT THE PLAN.

16:31.610 --> 16:34.110
-WHO IS HE?
-HE'S NO ONE.
JUST... JUST WAIT.

16:34.160 --> 16:35.870
TOSS YOUR GUN
TO THE FLOOR.

16:37.660 --> 16:38.740
&lt;GUN CLATTERS&gt;

16:38.790 --> 16:41.500
LOOK, UH, WHY DON'T
WE JUST TALK, RIGHT,

16:41.540 --> 16:43.460
AND YOU TELL US
WHAT YOU WANT?

16:43.500 --> 16:44.580
&lt;FIONA WHIMPERS&gt;

16:44.630 --> 16:46.000
THIS IS YOUR
BACK-UP, LOGAN?

16:46.040 --> 16:47.710
MAN, YOU HAVE CHANGED.

16:47.750 --> 16:49.340
YOU'LL BE HEARING FROM ME.

16:49.380 --> 16:51.300
DO NOT SCREW THIS UP.

16:51.340 --> 16:52.840
&lt;FIONA WHIMPERING&gt;

16:52.880 --> 16:54.180
AUDREY!

16:54.220 --> 16:56.010
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

16:56.050 --> 16:57.930
YOU MIND TELLING ME
WHAT YOU'RE NOT
TELLING ME HERE?

16:57.970 --> 16:59.560
COME ON, MAN.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
WE GOTTA GO AFTER THEM.

16:59.600 --> 17:01.180
AUDREY SAID THIS
WASN'T THE PLAN.

17:01.230 --> 17:02.270
SO, LOGAN,
WHAT IS THE PLAN?

17:02.310 --> 17:04.060
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT,
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

17:04.100 --> 17:06.230
TO START... &lt;GRUNTS&gt;

17:09.480 --> 17:11.360
ALL RIGHT, PALLY, IF YOU
DON'T WANT TO TELL ME,

17:11.400 --> 17:13.070
THEN YOU'RE GONNA
HAVE TO TELL LESLIE BENNETT,

17:13.110 --> 17:14.530
BECAUSE WE'RE GOING
BACK TO JAIL, MY SON.

17:15.240 --> 17:16.410
AH!

17:19.490 --> 17:20.740
&lt;SIGHS&gt;

17:21.830 --> 17:24.160
YOU WERE ON THE OUTSIDE
FOR ONE HOUR,

17:24.210 --> 17:27.840
AND YOU GET ME LOCKED
IN A SHED AND THEN YOU
LOSE THE HOSTAGE?

17:27.880 --> 17:29.750
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.
I... I COULDN'T WAIT
FOR ANYONE.

17:29.800 --> 17:31.130
I... I DIDN'T HAVE A CHOICE.

17:31.170 --> 17:35.300
LOOK, THERE IS SOMETHING
GOING ON BETWEEN LOGAN
HERE AND AUDREY.

17:35.340 --> 17:36.640
I CAN... I CAN FEEL IT.

17:36.680 --> 17:39.760
WHAT A SUCK-ASS RAT
YOU ARE.

17:39.810 --> 17:43.890
ALL RIGHT, DO YOU WANT TO
TELL US, UH, WHY YOU'RE SO
INTERESTED IN THIS CASE?

17:43.930 --> 17:45.850
JAKE, SHUT UP!

17:45.890 --> 17:48.610
-ANSWER HIS QUESTION.
-IT'S COMPLICATED.

17:48.650 --> 17:53.400
LOOK, YOUR HOSTAGE,
FIONA, IS STILL OUT THERE
AND ALIVE FOR NOW.

17:53.440 --> 17:55.150
ARE WE GOING TO KEEP
YAPPING OR ARE WE
GONNA GO GET HER?

17:55.200 --> 17:56.490
WE?

17:56.530 --> 17:58.700
"WE" ARE NOT A "WE", OKAY?

17:58.740 --> 18:01.200
-YOU TWO ARE
GOING BACK TO JAIL.
-LESLIE, COME ON.

18:01.240 --> 18:03.830
I DID MY PART, OKAY?
I BROUGHT HIM BACK.

18:03.870 --> 18:05.540
FORGET IT, JAKE.

18:05.580 --> 18:09.290
A WOMAN'S LIFE IS IN DANGER
AND NOW THE REAL COPS
ARE AFTER HER.

18:09.330 --> 18:11.300
THIS WHOLE IDEA
WAS RIDICULOUS.

18:11.340 --> 18:13.460
I'M NOT GOING BACK IN.
YOU CAN'T DO THIS.

18:13.510 --> 18:15.090
TAKE HIM BACK
TO HIS CELL.

18:15.130 --> 18:17.840
LOOK, YOU NEED ME...
YOU NEED ME TO FIND HER.
I CAN HELP. PLEASE!

18:22.430 --> 18:23.720
SO WHAT ABOUT ME?

18:24.890 --> 18:26.140
MY CHANCE, IT'S GONE?

18:27.190 --> 18:29.150
JAKE, I'M SORRY,
I CAN'T RISK IT.

18:29.190 --> 18:31.360
HOOD IS ON A RAMPAGE,
AND WITH HIS NEW STRIPES

18:31.400 --> 18:33.030
HE'S A BIT TO DEAL WITH
RIGHT NOW, I'M SORRY.

18:34.190 --> 18:35.320
IT'S FINE.

18:38.200 --> 18:39.240
I UNDERSTAND.

18:41.530 --> 18:46.080
WHEN JAKE AND I FIRST MET,
HE WAS JUST ALL ROMANCE.

18:46.120 --> 18:49.500
&lt;CHUCKLES&gt; JUST PERFECT.
ADVENTUROUS.

18:49.540 --> 18:51.960
RIGHT. WHEN WAS THAT EXACTLY?

18:52.000 --> 18:54.590
WELL, WE ONLY KNEW
EACH OTHER FOR A FEW
WEEKS BEFORE...

18:55.300 --> 18:57.510
WELL, YOU KNOW.

18:57.550 --> 19:00.930
THAT WAS, UM...
THAT WAS 10 MONTHS AGO.

19:00.970 --> 19:03.100
WOULD YOU GIVE US
A SECOND, HONEY?

19:06.520 --> 19:08.270
SO IF JAKE MET HER
10 MONTHS AGO...

19:08.310 --> 19:10.400
RIGHT, BUT FAKE JAKE
ONLY ASSUMED
JAKE'S IDENTITY LIKE

19:10.440 --> 19:14.400
-THREE WEEKS AGO...
-IF SHE'S LEGIT, THIS IS
JAKE'S REAL KID?

19:14.440 --> 19:17.110
&lt;SIGHS&gt;

19:17.150 --> 19:19.860
-WE NEED TO LOOK INTO THIS.
-YOU THINK KATHLEEN'S UP
FOR A LITTLE BABYSITTING?

19:19.910 --> 19:20.910
UH-HUH.

19:23.200 --> 19:25.240
CHANDRA, YOU'RE SO GRACEFUL.

19:27.410 --> 19:31.040
DES, FORGET ABOUT CHANDRA.

19:31.080 --> 19:33.290
YOU'VE BEEN BROKEN UP
FOR WEEKS. JUST MOVE ON.

19:33.340 --> 19:35.880
I KNOW, I KNOW. I'M FINE.

19:35.920 --> 19:38.760
WE WEREN'T RIGHT.
IT'S... WE JUST WEREN'T
PROPERLY COMPATIBLE.

19:38.800 --> 19:40.380
IT'S... YEAH, IT'S SIMPLE.

19:40.430 --> 19:42.340
RIGHT. SIMPLE.

19:42.390 --> 19:44.220
SO COULD WE PLEASE
STOP TALKING ABOUT HER NOW?

19:44.260 --> 19:46.010
YES, OF COURSE WE CAN
STOP TALKING ABOUT HER.

19:46.060 --> 19:47.060
THANK YOU.

19:49.060 --> 19:51.060
IT'S JUST CHANDRA HAD
THIS GRACE, YOU KNOW?

19:51.100 --> 19:54.690
AND... AND SHE
DIDN'T SINGE MY HAIR,
AND SHE DIDN'T HATE ME,

19:54.730 --> 19:56.860
AND SHE DIDN'T
CALL ME BAD NAMES.

19:56.900 --> 19:59.780
AND SHE DIDN'T ALWAYS
RUN AWAY FROM ME.

19:59.820 --> 20:01.990
DEAREST HEAVEN ON EARTH,
WHAT HAVE I DONE?

20:02.030 --> 20:04.870
-I NEED TO GET HER BACK.
-&lt;CELL PHONE RINGING&gt;

20:04.910 --> 20:07.080
-I THINK THAT'S HER NOW!
-GIVE ME, GIVE ME, GIVE ME,
GIVE ME, GIVE ME!

20:07.120 --> 20:08.910
I'M SORRY!
I MADE A HUGE MISTAKE!

20:08.950 --> 20:10.330
WHY? WHAT'D YOU DO?

20:10.370 --> 20:15.340
UM, NOTHING.
UH, GOOD QUESTION. UH...

20:15.380 --> 20:19.130
WHAT HAVE ANY OF US DONE,
PHILOSOPHICALLY SPEAKING.

20:19.170 --> 20:20.880
DES, WHAT DID YOU FIND OUT?

20:20.920 --> 20:24.390
UM, OH, RIGHT, RIGHT.
WELL, I HACKED INTO, UH,
LOGAN'S SECURE RNC FILE,

20:24.430 --> 20:26.760
AND HE WAS A NOTORIOUS
KIDNAPPER, AND BEFORE

20:26.810 --> 20:29.890
HE WAS CAUGHT
HE MADE A LOT OF MONEY.
LIKE, LIKE A LOT, A LOT.

20:29.930 --> 20:32.230
REALLY? HOW MUCH IS
"A LOT, A LOT"?

20:32.270 --> 20:35.440
UH, WELL, NO ONE KNOWS,
BUT A COUPLE MILLION IS
THE WORD ON THE STREET.

20:35.480 --> 20:36.900
ON THE STREET?

20:36.940 --> 20:39.740
WELL, IN HIS FILE.
BUT THE POLICE NEVER
RECOVERED THE BULK

20:39.780 --> 20:41.280
OF THE MONEY,
AND THEY SUSPECT

20:41.320 --> 20:42.650
IT MIGHT BE STASHED
SOMEWHERE ON THE OUTSIDE.

20:43.110 --> 20:44.450
HUH.

20:44.490 --> 20:47.200
SO LOGAN'S GOT A COUPLE
OF MILLION BUCKS STASHED, HEY?

20:47.700 --> 20:49.040
THANKS, DES.

20:51.870 --> 20:53.420
IT'S YOUR FAULT
WE'RE BACK IN HERE.

20:53.460 --> 20:55.250
YEAH, MY FAULT.
THAT MAKES SENSE.

20:55.290 --> 20:57.420
WE NEEDED TO GET TO FIONA,
AND NOW THERE'S NO CHANCE.

20:57.460 --> 20:58.750
RIGHT. THERE'S SOMETHING
GOING ON WITH YOU

20:58.800 --> 21:00.460
AND THE SOONER I CAN
FIGURE IT OUT,

21:00.510 --> 21:02.590
THE SOONER WE CAN FIND
THE MISSING GIRL

21:02.630 --> 21:04.300
AND I CAN GET OUT
OF THIS HELL HOLE.

21:04.340 --> 21:06.140
THERE'S A LOT MORE
AT STAKE THAN THAT.

21:06.180 --> 21:08.260
REALLY? LIKE A COUPLE
OF MILLION BUCKS?

21:09.310 --> 21:10.930
YOU KNOW, I CAN'T HELP
BUT THINK

21:10.970 --> 21:12.310
THAT IF I HAD A COUPLE
OF MILLION BUCKS

21:12.350 --> 21:13.980
STASHED ON THE OUTSIDE,

21:14.020 --> 21:15.850
I'D RUN TO IT THE FIRST
CHANCE THAT I GOT.

21:17.480 --> 21:18.820
YOU THINK YOU KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT,

21:18.860 --> 21:20.320
BUT YOU GOT NO CLUE.

21:20.360 --> 21:21.530
IF WE DON'T FIND FIONA,

21:21.570 --> 21:23.360
IT'S GONNA BE ON YOUR HEAD.

21:24.530 --> 21:25.780
JAKE, LOGAN.

21:26.950 --> 21:28.320
WE NEED TO TALK.

21:29.370 --> 21:30.870
[FIONA] "IF YOU WANT
TO SEE THE GIRL AGAIN,

21:30.910 --> 21:33.040
"YOU'LL DO AS I SAY.

21:33.080 --> 21:36.540
"BRING ME $20,000.
I WILL SEND THE LOCATION

21:36.580 --> 21:39.500
"AT THE LAST
POSSIBLE MOMENT.

21:39.540 --> 21:42.380
"THE P.I. AND THE CONVICT
WILL DELIVER THE MONEY
BY THEMSELVES.

21:43.630 --> 21:45.590
"ANY SIGN OF POLICE
AND THE GIRL..."

21:47.510 --> 21:48.350
THEY'LL KILL ME.

21:51.640 --> 21:54.810
-SO NOW WHAT?
-AUDREY DEMANDED THAT
YOU TWO DELIVER THE RANSOM.

21:55.560 --> 21:57.560
AND HOOD...

21:57.600 --> 21:59.650
I THINK THE NEW RANK
MIGHT HAVE PUSHED HIM
INTO CRAZY TOWN.

21:59.690 --> 22:01.020
HE TOLD ME TO LET YOU
OUT AGAIN.

22:01.070 --> 22:03.110
-NICE.
-EITHER WAY,

22:03.150 --> 22:04.900
WE NEED FIONA ALIVE
SO SHE CAN TESTIFY

22:04.950 --> 22:07.530
AGAINST SMITH CARSON,
WHO, BY THE WAY,

22:07.570 --> 22:11.030
IS ALSO A THREAT TO HER,
NOW THAT HE KNOWS THAT
SHE WAS GONNA FLIP ON HIM.

22:11.080 --> 22:13.330
-NICE WORK, DUMBASS.
-I KNEW WHAT I WAS DOING.

22:14.000 --> 22:15.250
WHAT DO YOU WANT
FROM US?

22:15.290 --> 22:19.130
THIS TIME DO EXACTLY AS
I SAY, OR I SWEAR, LOGAN,

22:19.170 --> 22:21.040
THIS IS ME BEING NICE.

22:21.090 --> 22:24.510
YOU TRY ME AGAIN,
YOU'RE GONNA GET A FRONT
ROW SEAT TO MY DARK SIDE.

22:24.550 --> 22:25.590
GOT ME?

22:27.720 --> 22:29.220
&lt;KNOCKING ON DOOR&gt;

22:30.050 --> 22:31.600
-COME IN.
-&lt;CRYING&gt;

22:31.640 --> 22:33.520
-&lt;KNOCKING ON DOOR&gt;
-COME IN!

22:33.560 --> 22:35.890
-[WALTER] HELLO?
-OKAY.

22:35.930 --> 22:38.440
UH, JAKE ASKED ME TO
LOOK INTO LOGAN HICKS,

22:38.480 --> 22:40.980
LIKE PERSONAL INFORMATION,
BANKING RECORDS, WHATEVER.

22:41.020 --> 22:42.650
ACTUALLY, IS ROSE HERE?
SHE'S BETTER AT THIS STUFF.

22:42.690 --> 22:44.610
NO. ROSE IS NOT HERE.

22:44.650 --> 22:46.070
BUT PERFECT. OKAY.
YOU KNOW WHAT?

22:46.110 --> 22:47.320
THIS IS GOOD, THIS IS GOOD.

22:47.360 --> 22:50.660
OKAY, SO WHY DON'T YOU JUST
HOLD THIS SCREAMING, UH,

22:50.700 --> 22:53.240
BUNDLE OF FUN, AND...
AND I'LL GO LOOK FOR IT
FOR YOU, OKAY?

22:53.290 --> 22:55.620
&lt;CHUCKLES&gt; AWESOME. GREAT.
IS JAKE AROUND?

22:55.660 --> 22:58.210
SHE'S BEEN SCREAMING FOR
20 MINUTES, THE MOTHER IS OUT,
I'M LOSING MY MIND.

22:58.250 --> 22:59.460
TAKE THE BABY!

23:00.080 --> 23:01.670
&lt;CONTINUES CRYING&gt;

23:04.500 --> 23:05.840
&lt;SIGHS&gt;

23:06.510 --> 23:07.800
&lt;STOPS CRYING&gt;

23:11.180 --> 23:12.550
WHATEVER YOU'RE DOING,
KEEP DOING IT.

23:13.640 --> 23:15.060
I'M NOT DOING ANYTHING.

23:15.100 --> 23:16.520
THEN DON'T MOVE.

23:18.600 --> 23:20.190
WHOSE KID IS THIS, ANYWAY?

23:20.600 --> 23:21.400
JAKE'S.

23:22.110 --> 23:23.360
&lt;SIGHS&gt;

23:26.440 --> 23:27.610
&lt;SEAGULLS SQUAWKING&gt;

23:30.200 --> 23:32.570
20,000 BUCKS FEELS LIKE
AN AWFULLY LOW
RANSOM DEMAND.

23:32.620 --> 23:33.830
SOMETHING ISN'T RIGHT HERE.

23:33.870 --> 23:35.660
WE DON'T GOT TIME
TO WORRY ABOUT THAT.

23:35.700 --> 23:38.080
IF THEY SEE COPS THEY'LL
KILL FIONA. I KNOW AUDREY.

23:38.120 --> 23:39.460
SHE SEES ANY POLICE...

23:39.500 --> 23:42.040
MR. HICKS, THIS IS
WHAT WE DO, OKAY?

23:42.080 --> 23:43.460
YOU JUST WORRY
ABOUT YOURSELF.

23:44.590 --> 23:46.550
-THERE'S A TRACKER IN THE BAG.
-AUDREY'S NO IDIOT.

23:46.590 --> 23:48.840
-SHE'LL DITCH THE BAG.
-IT'S STILL WORTH A SHOT.

23:51.180 --> 23:52.300
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED
TO DO WITH THIS?

23:52.340 --> 23:53.890
WE CAN LISTEN TO EVERYTHING
VIA THESE PHONES.

23:53.930 --> 23:55.510
JAKE, YOU KNOW THE DRILL.

23:55.560 --> 23:58.480
WELL, THE MICROPHONES IN
THESE THINGS ARE BETTER THAN
MOST LISTENING DEVICES.

23:58.520 --> 24:00.480
PLUS THEY'RE
A LOT LESS OBVIOUS.

24:00.520 --> 24:01.520
YOU GUYS READY?

24:01.560 --> 24:03.560
-FIVE MINUTES TO THE DROP.
-LET'S GO GET THE GIRL.

24:07.110 --> 24:08.440
THEY'RE GETTING IN PLACE.

24:09.490 --> 24:10.570
DROP ANY MINUTE.

24:11.570 --> 24:14.070
EVERYONE HOLD POSITION
UNTIL MY GO.

24:15.280 --> 24:17.540
DEEP THINKERS,
THOSE COPS.

24:17.580 --> 24:18.540
NO ONE WOULD EVER
NOTICE THEM, YOU KNOW,

24:18.580 --> 24:19.830
SITTING IN THE CARS
OVER THERE.

24:19.870 --> 24:21.710
OKAY, YOU JUST FOCUS
AND SEE IF YOU CAN SPOT

24:21.750 --> 24:23.080
YOUR EX-PARTNER, ALL RIGHT?

24:23.120 --> 24:25.210
AND DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT
RUNNING OFF ON ME AGAIN.

24:25.250 --> 24:27.880
DON'T WANT TO GET YOUR
GIRLFRIEND IN TROUBLE,
I UNDERSTAND.

24:27.920 --> 24:29.630
YOU TWO, YOU HAVE
A NICE CHEMISTRY.

24:29.670 --> 24:31.010
SHE DIGS YOU. I CAN FEEL IT.

24:31.800 --> 24:33.010
YOU'RE A LUCKY GUY.

24:34.050 --> 24:35.890
THIS IS OBVIOUSLY THE CAN.

24:36.510 --> 24:37.600
OH, CRAP!

24:47.400 --> 24:49.070
LOGAN!

24:49.110 --> 24:50.650
[OFFICER]
TIGHTEN THE PERIMETER.

24:50.690 --> 24:53.200
SUSPECT LOGAN HAS DISAPPEARED.
TIGHTEN THE PERIMETER.

24:55.370 --> 24:58.620
BENNETT. THE RNC'S
$20,000 IS GONE,

24:58.660 --> 25:00.410
AND I'M NOT GONNA
GET STUCK
WITH THE BLAME ON THIS.

25:00.450 --> 25:03.080
HOOD, THIS WAS YOUR IDEA,
AND NOT A VERY GOOD ONE,
IF YOU ASK ME.

25:03.120 --> 25:04.620
I'M NOT ASKING.

25:04.670 --> 25:06.080
AND THAT'S "SIR".
AND YOU...

25:06.130 --> 25:09.300
JUST WATCH IT,
OR JAKE GOES BACK TO JAIL

25:09.340 --> 25:11.260
AND YOU'LL END UP
AS CONSTABLE AGAIN.

25:14.550 --> 25:15.760
SO WHAT ARE YOU
THINKING ON THIS?

25:15.800 --> 25:18.600
BESIDES THE FACT THAT
HOOD'S A POWER HUNGRY
DICK-NOSE?

25:18.640 --> 25:20.770
LOOK JAKE, JUST FOCUS,

25:20.810 --> 25:23.100
OKAY? IT LOOKS LIKE
LOGAN WAS WORKING
WITH HIS OLD PARTNER.

25:23.140 --> 25:24.810
JUST HANG ON. ALL RIGHT?

25:24.850 --> 25:26.730
HE PULLED ME
OUT OF THE WAY
OF THAT EXPLOSION.

25:26.770 --> 25:28.110
I MEAN, IT COULD
HAVE KILLED ME.

25:28.150 --> 25:29.520
HOW DID HE KNOW
IT WAS THERE?

25:29.570 --> 25:31.030
HARD TO SAY.

25:31.070 --> 25:33.400
BUT I DO KNOW THAT LOGAN,
AUDREY AND FIONA,

25:33.450 --> 25:35.660
THEY'RE ALL
CONNECTED SOMEHOW.
WE JUST...

25:35.700 --> 25:36.990
WE GOTTA FIND ONE OF THEM.

25:40.660 --> 25:42.580
YOU WENT
AFTER JAKE DOYLE?

25:42.620 --> 25:45.580
-WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?
-UH, WHAT DID YOU THINK
I WAS GONNA DO,

25:45.620 --> 25:46.880
BUY HIM
A FATHER'S DAY CARD?

25:46.920 --> 25:48.420
I THOUGHT YOU WOULD
FINALLY DROP IT.

25:48.460 --> 25:50.630
UH, DROP WHAT? THE FACT
THAT YOU CHEATED ON ME,

25:50.670 --> 25:52.880
OR THE FACT THAT YOU LIED
ABOUT ME BEING THE FATHER?

25:52.920 --> 25:55.340
DON'T BE SUCH
A DRAMA QUEEN.

25:55.380 --> 25:57.390
I DON'T CARE IF HE DOES
END UP BACK IN PRISON.

25:57.430 --> 25:59.550
JAKE'S GOTTA STRAIGHTEN
THIS OUT NOW.

25:59.600 --> 26:01.930
I'M GONNA FIND HIM AND
DRAG HIS ASS BACK HERE.

26:01.970 --> 26:03.890
YOU KNOW, I THINK JAKE
WOULD MAKE A GREAT DAD.

26:07.690 --> 26:10.650
IF LOGAN ISN'T WORKING
WITH AUDREY, THEN WHAT
ARE WE LOOKING FOR HERE?

26:11.570 --> 26:12.860
THAT, RIGHT THERE.

26:14.690 --> 26:17.660
THE PHONE LOGS FROM
THE PRISON PAY PHONE
TO SMITH CARSON'S HOUSE.

26:19.410 --> 26:21.790
YOU THINK THAT SMITH
AND LOGAN CONSPIRED TOGETHER

26:21.830 --> 26:22.910
TO SET UP
THE KIDNAPPING?

26:22.950 --> 26:24.410
I WOULDN'T PUT IT PAST HIM.
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

26:24.450 --> 26:26.410
YOU WANNA RETURN TO
THE SCENE OF THE CRIME?

26:31.130 --> 26:34.800
[WALTER] YEP,
THIS IS JAKE'S KID ALL RIGHT.

26:34.840 --> 26:37.050
PUKED ON MY SHIRT,
JUST LIKE DADDY.

26:39.300 --> 26:40.850
YOU THINK JAKE'S
READY FOR THIS?

26:40.890 --> 26:42.640
NO. NOT A CHANCE.

26:43.260 --> 26:44.430
I MEAN, WERE YOU?

26:47.140 --> 26:48.440
NO WAY.

26:50.270 --> 26:51.820
I WAS SO YOUNG, YOU KNOW?

26:51.860 --> 26:53.730
I MEAN, THANK GOD
I HAD MY DAD
AND MY MOM, AND...

26:57.030 --> 26:58.320
YOU KNOW,
WHEN SHE WAS ALIVE.

26:59.360 --> 27:01.120
TINNY REMINDS ME SO MUCH
OF MY MOM.

27:04.830 --> 27:06.200
IT'S A GREAT THING,

27:06.750 --> 27:08.080
HAVING A KID.

27:09.750 --> 27:11.420
IT REALLY IS.

27:11.460 --> 27:12.920
THOSE THINGS ARE
A LOT OF WORK THOUGH.

27:14.130 --> 27:16.420
NOT THAT I WOULDN'T
WANT TO HAVE ONE...

27:17.050 --> 27:18.510
SOMEDAY, MAYBE.

27:19.380 --> 27:20.890
IS THAT SO?

27:20.930 --> 27:21.800
MEH.

27:23.300 --> 27:25.220
-HUH.
-WELL, YOU KNOW,

27:25.270 --> 27:28.520
LIKE EVERYONE, I...
I HAVE THAT SELFISH GENE

27:28.560 --> 27:31.600
THAT MAKES ME WANNA MAKE
LITTLE COPIES OF MYSELF.

27:31.650 --> 27:32.900
MMM-HMM.

27:32.940 --> 27:34.690
THEY'RE... THEY'RE GOOD
TAX BREAKS, TOO.

27:34.730 --> 27:36.400
&lt;SNIFFS&gt;

27:36.440 --> 27:37.690
WHOA!

27:37.740 --> 27:39.990
-DID... DID SHE DO THAT?
-MMM-HMM.

27:40.030 --> 27:41.870
HOW CAN A THING THAT SMALL
MAKE A SMELL LIKE THAT?

27:41.910 --> 27:43.320
-THAT'S BAD.
-&lt;LAUGHING&gt;

27:44.870 --> 27:46.870
SMITH! YOU AROUND?

27:49.120 --> 27:50.210
WHAT IS THIS?

27:51.040 --> 27:52.290
JAKE.

27:52.750 --> 27:54.210
LOOK OVER THERE.

27:55.960 --> 27:57.050
UH...

27:58.840 --> 28:00.590
I'M PRETTY SURE
HE'S DEAD.

28:07.890 --> 28:10.850
SO SMITH'S DEAD,
LOGAN'S MISSING,

28:10.890 --> 28:13.020
AND THE RNC
IS DOWN $20,000.

28:13.060 --> 28:15.400
YEAH, WHICH I'M ON
THE HOOK FOR,
DON'T FORGET.

28:15.440 --> 28:17.780
UH, YOUR BUDDY'S BACK.

28:20.740 --> 28:22.490
THAT'S ALL WE NEED NOW
IS CAPTAIN SUIT FACE

28:22.530 --> 28:24.370
COMING IN HERE
TO BARK HIS NONSENSE.

28:26.160 --> 28:27.410
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
IN MY CHAIR?

28:28.080 --> 28:29.620
-GET UP.
-&lt;SIGHS&gt;

28:30.960 --> 28:34.290
OBVIOUSLY FIONA'S
TESTIMONY IS MOOT,

28:34.330 --> 28:37.340
BUT SHE'S STILL IN DANGER,
PLUS WE GOT TWO HOMICIDES.

28:37.380 --> 28:38.760
JAKE, WE SHOULD JUST
SHUT THIS DOWN BEFORE

28:38.800 --> 28:40.510
HOOD POSTS ME
TO THE MAIL ROOM.

28:40.550 --> 28:43.050
NO, NO, NO, NO. LOOK,
WE GOTTA FIND LOGAN, OKAY?

28:43.090 --> 28:45.260
WE FIND LOGAN,
THEN WE'LL FIND
OUR KIDNAPPER

28:45.300 --> 28:47.010
AND POSSIBLY EVEN
OUR MURDERER.

28:47.060 --> 28:49.560
LOGAN'S FINGERPRINTS
ARE ALL OVER THAT BACKYARD.

28:49.600 --> 28:51.890
-HE KILLED SMITH?
-DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.

28:51.940 --> 28:53.810
SMITH HAD A STASH
OF MONEY THAT LOGAN

28:53.850 --> 28:55.730
WAS LOOKING FOR,
THEN WE GET THERE

28:55.770 --> 28:59.190
AND THERE HAPPENS TO BE
A BIG HOLE RECENTLY DUG IN
THE BACKYARD? COME ON.

28:59.230 --> 29:01.740
ALL RIGHT, FINE. WE DON'T
GOT MUCH TIME.

29:01.780 --> 29:04.490
YOU FIND LOGAN, I'LL STICK
WITH THE MISSING GIRL.

29:04.530 --> 29:06.780
-FINE.
-THAT'S THE SPIRIT.

29:13.540 --> 29:14.920
HEY, JAKE. JAKE, HOLD UP.

29:14.960 --> 29:16.840
OH, DAD. GOOD. LISTEN,

29:16.880 --> 29:19.550
I'M IN A BIT OF A HURRY.
I NEED YOUR HELP.
UH, IT'S CRUNCH TIME.

29:19.590 --> 29:21.510
I GOTTA FIND LOGAN.

29:21.550 --> 29:23.930
-OW, B'Y.
-YOU HAVE TO HEAR
SOMETHING IMPORTANT.

29:23.970 --> 29:26.430
WHAT COULD BE MORE IMPORTANT
THAN FINDING A KIDNAPPED GIRL?

29:26.470 --> 29:27.640
YOUR DAUGHTER?

29:29.890 --> 29:31.180
MY WHAT NOW?

29:31.220 --> 29:35.480
AND YOU KNOW, THERE'S
ACTUALLY A RESEMBLANCE.

29:35.520 --> 29:36.980
HER MOTHER LAURA'S
LOOKING FOR YOU.

29:37.020 --> 29:39.650
DAD, OBVIOUSLY WHOEVER
THE FATHER OF THIS KID IS,

29:39.690 --> 29:42.400
IT'S THE TOOL WHO WAS
PRETENDING TO BE ME.

29:42.440 --> 29:44.200
DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT REPRODUCTION?

29:44.240 --> 29:46.910
UH, YEAH. YOU GAVE ME
THE TALK WHEN I WAS
12, REMEMBER?

29:46.950 --> 29:48.320
SHE GOT PREGNANT
10 MONTHS AGO.

29:48.370 --> 29:49.950
FAKE JAKE WAS ONLY
PRETENDING TO BE YOU

29:49.990 --> 29:51.040
FOR THE LAST FEW WEEKS.

29:52.000 --> 29:52.870
RING A BELL?

29:54.250 --> 29:56.830
UH, MAYBE.

29:56.870 --> 29:58.540
YOU ARE GONNA
MAKE THIS RIGHT.

29:58.590 --> 30:01.420
UH, I COULD BE A FATHER.

30:03.260 --> 30:04.590
I COULD BE A F...

30:04.630 --> 30:05.970
DAD, I GOTTA STAY
OUT OF JAIL.

30:06.010 --> 30:07.220
LISTEN TO YOURSELF.

30:07.260 --> 30:09.010
WHERE DID I GO
SO WRONG WITH YOU?

30:09.050 --> 30:11.560
YOU WANT A LIST?
LET'S JUST SAY THAT IF...
IF... IF THIS IS MY KID,

30:11.600 --> 30:13.810
I'M NOT GOING TO BE
USING ANY OF YOUR
PARENTING TECHNIQUES.

30:15.640 --> 30:17.810
I, UM... I GOTTA...

30:17.850 --> 30:21.940
I GOTTA CALL WALTER.
UH... UH...

30:21.980 --> 30:24.740
NICE WORK, UH,
GETTING THE KID TO SHUT UP.
SERIOUSLY.

30:24.780 --> 30:26.030
IT WAS GOOD.

30:26.070 --> 30:28.320
YEAH, WELL,
I THINK IT WAS

30:28.360 --> 30:30.410
YOUR WHISKEY BOTTLE
PUPPET SHOW

30:30.450 --> 30:31.910
THAT KIND OF
SEALED THE DEAL.

30:31.950 --> 30:34.870
PERHAPS. PERHAPS I HAVE
A HIDDEN TALENT.

30:34.910 --> 30:37.120
I WAS STARTING TO THINK
THE SAME THING MYSELF.

30:39.920 --> 30:42.250
I, UH, SHOULD GET BACK
TO THIS STUFF FOR JAKE,
I GUESS.

30:42.630 --> 30:43.710
&lt;COOING&gt;

30:43.760 --> 30:45.590
THANKS A LOT,
YOU KNOW, FOR YOUR HELP.

30:45.920 --> 30:47.050
&lt;CHUCKLES&gt;

30:47.090 --> 30:48.680
YOU'RE A NATURAL.

30:48.720 --> 30:49.890
&lt;CELL PHONE RINGING&gt;

30:50.430 --> 30:52.220
UH... OH. I, UH...

30:52.260 --> 30:53.810
YEAH. JUST... YOU...

30:53.850 --> 30:55.100
YEAH, I'M GONNA
HAVE TO CHECK.

30:55.140 --> 30:56.480
OR JUST LET IT GO
TO VOICEMAIL.

30:56.520 --> 30:58.020
OH, IT... IT'S JAKE,
SO I'D BETTER...

30:58.060 --> 30:59.400
-YEAH, YOU SHOULD GET IT.
-YEAH, YEAH. OKAY.

30:59.440 --> 31:00.770
UM, JAKE!

31:00.810 --> 31:03.110
-WALTER.
-WHEN DID YOU GET
A BABY, ANYWAY?

31:03.150 --> 31:04.820
I CAN'T EVEN TOUCH THAT
RIGHT NOW, SO JUST...

31:04.860 --> 31:06.650
JUST TELL ME WHAT YOU GOT
ON LOGAN'S FINANCES.

31:06.690 --> 31:09.240
YEAH. IT... IT DOES LOOK
LIKE HE HAD A WHACK OF

31:09.280 --> 31:11.070
CASH BEFORE HE GOT POPPED.

31:11.120 --> 31:15.950
UM, AND HE'S GOT INVESTMENTS
IN TWO SEPARATE PIECES
OF PROPERTY.

31:16.000 --> 31:17.250
REALLY? WHERE?

31:17.290 --> 31:20.040
THE FIRST ONE
IS A WAREHOUSE
OUT BY THE AIRPORT.

31:20.080 --> 31:22.790
LET ME GUESS. IT'S CURRENTLY
BEING USED AS A GARAGE.

31:22.840 --> 31:24.050
YEAH. HOW'D YOU KNOW?

31:24.090 --> 31:25.050
WHAT ELSE?
WHAT ELSE DO YOU GOT?

31:25.090 --> 31:29.130
UH... HE, UH, HE HAD
A HOUSE IN... IN RABBITTOWN,

31:29.180 --> 31:34.260
BUT, JAKE, 10 YEARS AGO
HE TRANSFERRED, UH,
OWNERSHIP OVER TO...

31:34.310 --> 31:36.020
-FIONA MICHAELS. -YEAH.

31:36.060 --> 31:37.680
WHAT ARE YOU? REVEEN?

31:37.730 --> 31:40.440
UH, ANYWAY... UH,
HE TRANSFERRED OWNERSHIP

31:40.480 --> 31:42.770
THE DAY BEFORE HE WENT
INTO PRISON.

31:42.810 --> 31:45.320
RIGHT. THOSE PHONE CALLS
FROM THE PRISON PAY-PHONE,

31:45.360 --> 31:47.820
THEY WEREN'T TO SMITH.
THEY WERE...

31:47.860 --> 31:50.150
LISTEN, WALTER,
UH, GREAT WORK.
I GOTTA GO.

31:50.200 --> 31:52.070
DAD! WANNA GO
FOR A RIDE?

31:54.990 --> 31:56.620
-THAT WAS JAKE.
-UH-HUH.

31:58.370 --> 32:01.080
WALTER, THIS IS
GONNA SOUND KIND OF
OUT OF PLACE,

32:01.120 --> 32:03.960
YOU KNOW? I, UH...

32:04.000 --> 32:05.500
I THINK I'VE ALWAYS HAD
A CRUSH ON YOU...

32:07.170 --> 32:08.760
&lt;COOING&gt;

32:19.100 --> 32:21.390
THIS MUST BE WHERE AUDREY
AND LOGAN USED TO HIDE OUT

32:21.440 --> 32:23.060
BACK IN THE DAY
WHEN THEY WERE PARTNERS.

32:23.980 --> 32:25.020
&lt;DOOR OPENING&gt;

32:25.520 --> 32:26.820
IDIOT!

32:26.860 --> 32:29.190
YOU GOTTA GET OUT OF HERE NOW!
YOU'RE GONNA RUIN EVERYTHING!

32:29.240 --> 32:32.110
JUST CALM DOWN, LOGAN.
WE'RE NOT HERE
FOR YOUR MONEY.

32:32.160 --> 32:33.870
I DIDN'T KILL SMITH.

32:33.910 --> 32:36.700
HE WAS ALREADY DEAD
WHEN I WENT TO GRAB
MY CASH AT THE HOUSE.

32:36.740 --> 32:38.240
AUDREY MUST HAVE
GOT TO HIM FIRST.

32:38.290 --> 32:39.450
THAT'S WHAT WE FIGURED.

32:39.500 --> 32:43.620
LOOK, WE GOTTA
TALK ABOUT FIONA.

32:43.670 --> 32:46.090
JAKE TELLS ME
SHE'S YOUR DAUGHTER.

32:46.130 --> 32:47.250
[JAKE] WE TRACKED
THE WHOLE THING.

32:47.300 --> 32:49.760
WE JUST DON'T KNOW
WHY AUDREY KIDNAPPED HER.

32:49.800 --> 32:53.220
IT'S OBVIOUS YOU'RE IN
A BIT OF A SITUATION HERE.

32:53.260 --> 32:55.180
YOU HAVE TO TRUST US.
WE CAN HELP.

32:57.220 --> 32:59.890
AUDREY KNEW I WAS
GETTING OUT SOON.

32:59.930 --> 33:01.430
FIGURED SHE
COULD USE FIONA
AS A BARGAINING CHIP

33:01.480 --> 33:03.230
TO GET ME TO TELL HER
WHERE MY CASH WAS.

33:03.270 --> 33:05.190
SO WHY DID YOU BAIL ON US
BACK AT THE DROP?

33:06.060 --> 33:07.520
WHERE'D YOU GO?

33:07.570 --> 33:10.030
I NEEDED TO GET MY STASH
WITHOUT ANY COPS WATCHING.

33:11.570 --> 33:13.650
AUDREY'S GONNA
BE HERE ANY SECOND.

33:13.700 --> 33:15.410
EVEN IF I PAY HER,
SHE STILL MIGHT KILL FIONA.

33:15.450 --> 33:16.620
SHE'S NUTS.

33:16.660 --> 33:18.450
WE CAN STILL FIND A WAY
OUT OF THIS.

33:18.490 --> 33:20.750
AFTER ALL THESE YEARS,

33:20.790 --> 33:23.920
THIS IS HOW I START
MY RELATIONSHIP
WITH MY DAUGHTER?

33:23.960 --> 33:26.250
I MEAN, HONESTLY, JAKE,
WHAT KIND OF FATHER AM I?

33:26.290 --> 33:27.210
[MAL] NO ONE'S PERFECT.

33:28.290 --> 33:31.170
YOU CAN TAKE IT
FROM BOTH OF US.

33:31.210 --> 33:34.550
YEAH. YOU KNOW, WE'VE ALL
GOT A COUPLE OF SKELETONS
IN OUR CLOSETS, RIGHT?

33:34.590 --> 33:37.010
FIONA DIDN'T EVEN KNOW THAT
I BURIED MY MONEY IN HER
BACKYARD.

33:38.850 --> 33:40.390
DROP IT, NOW.

33:41.720 --> 33:43.100
YOU TWO,
OVER THERE WITH HIM.

33:43.140 --> 33:46.400
OOH, YOU BROUGHT
MY MONEY, LOGAN. GOOD MAN.

33:46.440 --> 33:48.400
WHY DID
YOU BRING THESE TWO?
I'M CONFUSED.

33:48.440 --> 33:50.270
THAT'S MY... I... I...
I FOLLOWED HIM.

33:50.320 --> 33:51.480
YOU KNOW, I SHOULD
INTRODUCE MYSELF.

33:51.530 --> 33:54.280
-MY NAME IS JAKE DOYLE.
-DIDN'T I KILL YOU LAST NIGHT?

33:54.320 --> 33:55.200
YES. NO.

33:55.240 --> 33:57.620
IT'S COMPLICATED.
BUT, HEY, IT'S A MIRACLE.

33:57.660 --> 33:59.280
I FEEL MUCH BETTER.

33:59.330 --> 34:01.740
-DAD?
-FIONA, HONEY,
DID SHE HURT YOU?

34:02.250 --> 34:03.290
NO.

34:03.330 --> 34:05.160
[JAKE] OKAY, LOOK,

34:05.210 --> 34:07.210
WE ALL WANT
THE SAME THING HERE.
ALL RIGHT?

34:07.250 --> 34:09.590
SO JUST PUT THE GUN DOWN,
LET THE GIRL GO,

34:09.630 --> 34:11.050
AND TAKE THE MONEY.

34:11.090 --> 34:13.210
WHY DON'T I JUST TAKE
THE MONEY AND THEN USE
FIONA AS INSURANCE

34:13.260 --> 34:15.510
-TO GET OUT OF TOWN?
-THAT'S NOT EXACTLY
A FAIR DEAL.

34:15.550 --> 34:17.840
YOU'RE RIGHT.
SHOULD PROBABLY JUST KILL
YOU ALL BEFORE I LEAVE.

34:17.890 --> 34:19.300
-&lt;WHIMPERS&gt;
-UH, HOLD ON.

34:19.350 --> 34:21.260
LET'S, UH, REVISIT
YOUR FIRST PROPOSAL,

34:21.310 --> 34:22.890
YOU KNOW, WHERE
EVERYONE LIVES?

34:22.930 --> 34:24.230
&lt;GRUNTS&gt;

34:24.270 --> 34:25.270
&lt;GUNSHOT&gt;

34:27.400 --> 34:29.310
PUT THE GUN AWAY, LOGAN.

34:30.400 --> 34:31.650
LOGAN.

34:31.690 --> 34:33.110
TRUST ME.

34:33.150 --> 34:35.190
NO ONE REALLY BELIEVES
THAT YOU'LL SHOOT AT ME.

34:35.240 --> 34:36.360
NOT WITH
YOUR PRINCESS HERE.

34:37.740 --> 34:38.780
YOU'RE RIGHT.

34:41.200 --> 34:44.040
NO! YOU SOAKED THE
MONEY IN GAS! AH!

34:44.700 --> 34:46.710
&lt;SCREAMS&gt;

34:46.750 --> 34:49.830
HEY, HEY! GRABBING THINGS
ON FIRE, EVEN MONEY,

34:49.880 --> 34:52.250
IS A REALLY,
REALLY STUPID IDEA.

34:52.300 --> 34:53.880
NOW THAT WAS
WELL DONE, SON.

34:53.920 --> 34:56.590
YEAH, WELL, I DIDN'T DO
ANYTHING. IT WAS LOGAN...

34:59.010 --> 35:00.140
WHERE'S LOGAN?

35:00.180 --> 35:01.760
&lt;AUDREY SOBS&gt;

35:07.020 --> 35:10.440
SERGEANT, MY CLIENT'S
COOPERATED WITH YOU
AND YOUR TEAM FULLY,

35:10.480 --> 35:12.440
SO WHAT'S THE STORY
ON THE APPEAL?

35:12.480 --> 35:14.530
WELL, THE BRASS DOESN'T
WANT ANY OF THIS TO GET OUT.

35:14.570 --> 35:16.740
-REALLY?
-AND SOMEBODY
JUST TOLD THEM

35:16.780 --> 35:19.280
THAT JAKE WOULD
GO TO THE PRESS

35:19.320 --> 35:22.070
IF HOOD DIDN'T HOLD UP
HIS END OF THE BARGAIN.

35:22.120 --> 35:26.580
NOW THAT SOMEONE WOULDN'T
HAPPEN TO LOOK AWESOME

35:26.620 --> 35:28.790
IN A TIGHT LITTLE PANTSUIT
NOW, WOULD SHE?

35:30.080 --> 35:31.710
CONGRATS, JAKE.

35:31.750 --> 35:33.960
THE APPEAL WENT THROUGH.
YOU'RE A FREE MAN.

35:34.000 --> 35:36.880
-HE CAN GO?
-AS SOON AS HE SIGNS
A NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT,

35:36.920 --> 35:38.170
YES.

35:39.090 --> 35:40.220
&lt;HOOD GRUNTS&gt;

35:44.510 --> 35:47.230
UH, WHAT'S WITH HIM?

35:47.270 --> 35:49.020
HE JUST GOT DEMOTED
BACK TO SERGEANT.

35:49.060 --> 35:50.600
WELL, WHAT DO YOU KNOW?

35:50.650 --> 35:53.230
IT'S A WIN-WIN SITUATION
FOR EVERYONE.

35:53.270 --> 35:55.520
AND I MIGHT
NOT BE FAR BEHIND.

35:55.570 --> 35:57.240
THEY'RE BLAMING ME FOR
THE MISSING 20 GRAND.

35:57.280 --> 35:58.320
WHAT?

35:58.360 --> 35:59.860
IT'S NOT YOUR PROBLEM,
JAKE DOYLE.

35:59.900 --> 36:02.740
GO HOME.
MAYBE I'LL CATCH A BREAK

36:02.780 --> 36:04.240
AND LOGAN WILL
TURN UP WITH THE MONEY.

36:08.790 --> 36:11.290
&lt;CLEARS THROAT&gt;
WELL, CONGRATS, MAN.

36:11.920 --> 36:13.880
YOU ARE A FREE MAN.

36:13.920 --> 36:15.960
&lt;STUTTERING&gt; I, UH,
I GOTTA GO.

36:17.090 --> 36:18.840
AND YOU GOTTA MEET
YOUR NEW DAUGHTER.

36:18.880 --> 36:20.170
GOOD LUCK, DADDY.

36:30.350 --> 36:31.560
-[TINNY] DES.
-&lt;KEYBOARD CLACKING&gt;

36:31.600 --> 36:34.270
-WHAT?
-YOU'RE TYPING TOO LOUD.
KNOCK IT OFF.

36:34.310 --> 36:36.440
SORRY.

36:36.480 --> 36:40.110
[SIGHS] ALL THOSE
DEPRESSING SONGS,
YOU KNOW? THEY NEVER

36:40.150 --> 36:43.030
MAKE SENSE UNTIL YOU'VE
ACTUALLY LIVED THEM.

36:43.070 --> 36:46.120
RIGHT. I CAN'T WAIT FOR YOU
TO ELABORATE ON THAT.

36:46.160 --> 36:48.370
REALLY? OH, THANKS FOR
FINALLY LISTENING.

36:48.410 --> 36:49.870
MMM-HMM.

41:07.630 --> 41:09.670
IT WAS STUPID, I KNOW.

41:24.480 --> 41:27.310

42:31.880 --> 42:34.170
-WHERE'D YOU GET THIS?
-IT WAS FROM LOGAN.

42:34.210 --> 42:36.340
I HAVE A SWORN STATEMENT
FROM HIM.

42:36.380 --> 42:38.470
I MEAN, I KNOW HE'S
A FUGITIVE, BUT STILL,

42:38.510 --> 42:42.470
HE SWEARS THAT THAT'S
THE RNC'S MISSING $20,000.

42:42.510 --> 42:43.850
A SWORN STATEMENT?
DID YOU FIND HIM?

42:43.890 --> 42:45.810
NO. I DIDN'T SEE LOGAN.

42:45.850 --> 42:48.020
IF I DID, I WOULD HAVE
OBVIOUSLY TURNED HIM IN
TO YOU.

42:48.060 --> 42:49.770
HE JUST... HE LEFT
THAT HERE FOR ME.

42:50.770 --> 42:52.480
JAKE, I CAN'T
SUBMIT THIS.

42:52.520 --> 42:54.230
