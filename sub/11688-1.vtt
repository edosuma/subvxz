WEBVTT

01:12.383 --> 01:13.916
Hey, Rusty James.

01:14.677 --> 01:17.872
Biff Wilcox is looking for you,
Rusty James.

01:17.972 --> 01:19.372
I'm not hiding.

01:19.516 --> 01:22.716
He says he's gonna kill you,
Rusty James.

01:25.605 --> 01:27.272
Sayin' ain't doin'.

01:28.024 --> 01:29.124
Shit!

01:30.568 --> 01:32.235
Shit, that's tough.

01:33.113 --> 01:34.806
These things happen, Rusty James.

01:34.906 --> 01:37.058
Maybe we should go
double or nothing sometime.

01:37.158 --> 01:38.258
Sit down!

01:38.660 --> 01:41.354
You cats are constantly fighting
and arguing amongst yourselves

01:41.454 --> 01:43.064
like typical fucking Yahoos.

01:43.164 --> 01:45.400
Watch the language. Come on.

01:45.500 --> 01:48.300
Hey, Benny, get me a chocolate milk.

01:50.421 --> 01:53.867
So what's he doing about this, this Biff?
What's he doing about killing me?

01:53.967 --> 01:56.161
The deal is, man, you're supposed
to meet him tonight

01:56.261 --> 02:00.594
under the arches behind
the pet store at about 10 o'clock.

02:01.808 --> 02:04.794
- Put a little hair on your chest.
- He's coming alone then, huh?

02:04.894 --> 02:07.161
I wouldn't count on it, man.

02:07.605 --> 02:10.592
Well, if he's bringing friends,
then I'm bringing friends.

02:10.692 --> 02:12.844
Yeah, but you know how
that's gonna turn out, Rusty James.

02:12.944 --> 02:14.846
Everybody will end up getting into it.

02:14.946 --> 02:17.348
You bring people, he brings people.
You're gonna have to...

02:17.448 --> 02:21.311
If you think I'm going by myself,
you're fucking crazy.

02:21.411 --> 02:25.148
Watch your language over there.
Watch it! Bring it down. Cool it off.

02:25.248 --> 02:27.275
Butt out! What the hell
do you think you're doing?

02:27.375 --> 02:29.527
Fuck you, Smokey.
Steve goes wherever I go.

02:29.627 --> 02:32.739
Steve, come here, sit down.
Sit down and be quiet.

02:32.839 --> 02:35.825
Damn it, Rusty James, it's been a long time
since we've had that kind of trouble.

02:35.925 --> 02:38.925
Chicken, Smoke?
Oh, Smoke's a chicken.

02:39.137 --> 02:40.670
Bawk, bawk, bawk!

02:41.514 --> 02:43.750
- Smoke doesn't want to come.
- Smokey, we understand chickens.

02:43.850 --> 02:45.983
- Hey, Rusty James.
- BJ!

02:48.062 --> 02:49.662
Smoke's a chicken!

02:50.565 --> 02:52.467
What? You don't wanna come? Fine.

02:52.567 --> 02:56.434
Hey, Rusty James,
you know I'm gonna be there, man.

02:56.696 --> 02:58.848
But you know what the Motorcycle Boy
said about gang fights...

02:58.948 --> 03:00.975
The Motorcycle Boy hasn't been around
for two months.

03:01.075 --> 03:02.685
So don't go telling me about that.

03:02.785 --> 03:05.313
What if the Motorcycle Boy
came back and found out?

03:05.413 --> 03:06.513
What?

03:06.831 --> 03:09.484
I said what if your brother came back
and found out?

03:09.584 --> 03:14.155
My brother ain't back, man, all right!
I'm sick of hearing this shit!

03:14.255 --> 03:16.241
I don't know when he's coming back,
if he's coming back!

03:16.341 --> 03:19.911
So if you assholes want to wait around for
the rest of your life to see what he says,

03:20.011 --> 03:21.478
fine, fine, man.

03:21.638 --> 03:23.206
Get down off there!

03:23.306 --> 03:25.125
I'm gonna stomp that
little shitass tonight.

03:25.225 --> 03:27.669
And I should have a few fucking friends.
Are you listening to me?

03:27.769 --> 03:30.797
We're gonna be there, man. All right?
We are going to be there.

03:30.897 --> 03:34.164
- But let's keep it between you two.
- BJ!

03:35.944 --> 03:39.411
- I'm right behind you.
- Get down off there!

03:41.199 --> 03:43.532
I'm sorry, Benny. Sorry, man.

03:49.582 --> 03:52.152
Man, I love fights, man!
This reminds me of the old days

03:52.252 --> 03:53.820
when we used to have rumbles.

03:53.920 --> 03:56.823
Heroin ruined the gangs, man.
Junk, you know?

03:56.923 --> 03:58.390
I wouldn't know.

03:59.008 --> 04:02.871
Ask my brother, he'll tell you.
A gang really meant something back then.

04:02.971 --> 04:05.206
That gang shit was out of style
when you was 10 years old.

04:05.306 --> 04:08.973
Bullshit, man, I was fucking 11.
I can remember.

04:09.894 --> 04:13.673
I was in the Swamp Babies. That was
the pee-wee branch of the Packers.

04:13.773 --> 04:16.426
A gang really meant something back then.

04:16.526 --> 04:19.053
Yeah, like getting sent to the hospital
once a week.

04:19.153 --> 04:21.180
You have no loyalty, man!
No organisation!

04:21.281 --> 04:23.600
Well, look it, I'm going, ain't I?

04:23.700 --> 04:26.019
If you think it'll be a rumble,
you're crazy.

04:26.119 --> 04:30.481
Cos you and Biff are gonna go at it,
and the rest of us is gonna watch and...

04:30.581 --> 04:33.818
I doubt too many people are gonna
show up for that much anyway.

04:33.918 --> 04:35.185
Yeah, listen.

04:36.004 --> 04:39.741
You guys, I'll be right with you.
I gotta go talk to someone. Right?

04:39.841 --> 04:41.441
Patty! Patty, hey.

04:42.969 --> 04:44.836
Who are you, stranger?

04:45.013 --> 04:48.499
- Rusty James, the man of your dreams!
- You mean my nightmares?

04:48.599 --> 04:50.266
What are you doin'?

04:50.810 --> 04:53.421
- Rusty James!
- Listen, babe, I'm coming over tonight.

04:53.521 --> 04:54.854
Rusty James...

04:56.232 --> 04:59.135
- I'm not allowed to have boyfriends over.
- Since when?

04:59.235 --> 05:01.846
- Since I started having boyfriends.
- When was this?

05:01.946 --> 05:04.182
- When I was 9.
- Get back in there, Donna!

05:04.282 --> 05:08.311
- First time I ever heard about it.
- I haven't seen you in a long time.

05:08.411 --> 05:11.397
- I've been busy, man.
- So I've heard.

05:11.497 --> 05:15.860
Hey, listen, I'm coming over tonight.
So, you'd better roll out the red carpet!

05:15.960 --> 05:17.827
Yeah, well, we'll see.

05:17.962 --> 05:20.698
Hey, you're crazy about me,
you know that?

05:20.798 --> 05:21.898
I am?

05:25.094 --> 05:27.872
You know, you set up a fight,
and you recruit half the neighbourhood.

05:27.972 --> 05:30.166
And now I guess you've got
plans of your own, huh?

05:30.266 --> 05:32.043
Yup, take a walk, Smoke.

05:32.143 --> 05:35.129
If Biff's there and you don't show up,
you know what happens to the rest of us?

05:35.229 --> 05:37.340
You think he's gonna believe
we went there to watch?

05:37.440 --> 05:39.107
Hey, listen, man...

05:40.818 --> 05:43.596
Split up, meet there at 9:30.
I won't let you down, all right?

05:43.696 --> 05:45.163
Let's go, Steve.

06:00.463 --> 06:02.407
What's the matter with you?

06:02.507 --> 06:04.240
You got a cigarette?

06:05.093 --> 06:07.161
You know I don't have any cigarettes.

06:07.261 --> 06:09.194
That's right. I forgot.

06:12.016 --> 06:13.283
What's wrong?

06:15.561 --> 06:19.028
Nothing. I'm just a little tired.
That's all.

06:20.316 --> 06:23.783
Is it because
the Motorcycle Boy's been gone?

06:25.071 --> 06:28.538
Steve, I don't want to talk about him,
right?

06:28.866 --> 06:30.933
Don't start up on me, OK?

06:32.370 --> 06:33.855
What's with this?

06:33.955 --> 06:36.822
- Huh?
- It's a habit I got into it.

06:37.667 --> 06:39.467
Yeah, well, break it.

07:10.533 --> 07:13.686
- Hey, Rusty James.
- Hey, Donna, your sister home?

07:13.786 --> 07:16.356
Yeah, but I thought
you were coming to see me.

07:16.456 --> 07:18.189
Is your mother home?

07:18.499 --> 07:22.028
No, my sister's home.
How about seeing me after?

07:22.128 --> 07:24.328
Patty! Rusty James is here.

07:28.217 --> 07:29.617
Hi, sweetheart.

07:31.512 --> 07:34.207
I thought I told you I wasn't
supposed to have company tonight.

07:34.307 --> 07:35.840
What? What? What?

07:37.143 --> 07:39.545
What have you been so busy with?

07:39.645 --> 07:41.464
- What have I been so busy with?
- Yes.

07:41.564 --> 07:46.135
Nothing. I just been... hanging around
basically. Just messing around.

07:46.235 --> 07:49.263
- Yeah, with girls?
- Girls? What are you talking about?

07:49.363 --> 07:51.432
Girls? You know I'd never do that.

07:51.532 --> 07:53.599
You're always with girls.

07:54.660 --> 07:57.522
- Get back inside, squirt.
- I wanna listen to your conversation.

07:57.622 --> 07:59.222
- OK.
- Wise guy.

08:00.917 --> 08:03.450
- Traitor!
- I'm not a traitor.

08:14.555 --> 08:16.249
So, how've you been?

08:16.349 --> 08:17.449
Donna!

08:26.108 --> 08:27.708
I get the picture.

08:29.445 --> 08:32.044
All right, get outta here, Donna.

08:43.626 --> 08:45.226
- Yuck!
- Ha, ha!

08:46.879 --> 08:48.823
You guys aren't supposed
to do that in front of me.

08:48.923 --> 08:52.056
- Donna, go to your room now!
- Bedtime.

08:53.052 --> 08:57.652
I should do my 10-page report on you,
including illustrations!

08:58.182 --> 09:00.915
- You're gonna get it.
- Have fun!

09:06.107 --> 09:09.574
You know, I really missed you,
you know that.

09:38.180 --> 09:39.280
Babe...

10:22.558 --> 10:23.758
Rusty James.

10:25.686 --> 10:27.486
Rusty James, wake up!

10:27.980 --> 10:31.717
What the fuck are you doing?
Jesus, what time is it?

10:31.817 --> 10:36.017
- Is it morning or night?
- Night. You're great company.

10:37.531 --> 10:38.998
A quarter to 10.

10:40.701 --> 10:44.901
I gotta... Oh, shit,
I gotta fight Biff Wilcox at 10:00.

10:55.091 --> 10:58.091
Thanks.
Now mum will think I drank it.

11:04.725 --> 11:05.825
Finish it.

11:14.944 --> 11:16.944
What's the matter, babe?

11:17.113 --> 11:18.713
Come on, cheer up.

11:19.240 --> 11:23.040
You told me you wouldn't
be fighting all the time.

11:23.661 --> 11:26.105
Well, this isn't all the time.
This is just this once, all right?

11:26.205 --> 11:27.938
You always say that.

11:29.083 --> 11:32.320
You always try so hard to be
like your brother, Rusty James.

11:32.420 --> 11:34.655
Hey, my brother's the coolest.

11:34.755 --> 11:36.616
Well, you're better than cool.
You're warm.

11:36.716 --> 11:37.916
Yeah, but...

11:39.719 --> 11:40.852
He's smart.

11:41.637 --> 11:42.904
You're smart!

11:44.098 --> 11:45.831
Just not word smart.

11:46.851 --> 11:47.951
Yeah?

11:48.978 --> 11:50.078
Listen.

11:54.734 --> 11:57.334
I love you.
But I gotta run, OK?

12:05.244 --> 12:08.044
- All right. See you later.
- Yeah.

12:13.836 --> 12:14.969
Be careful!

12:20.634 --> 12:21.767
I love you.

12:28.142 --> 12:31.504
Hey, Rusty James!
We just about gave up on you!

12:31.604 --> 12:33.339
Watch out.
I'll take you on for warm-up.

12:33.439 --> 12:35.839
Hey, man. You ready? Let's go.

12:38.277 --> 12:40.077
Who's here, man? Huh?

12:40.279 --> 12:42.556
I gotta have as many guys as Biff.
This is bullshit!

12:42.656 --> 12:45.768
I thought we were supposed to watch,
Rusty James.

12:45.868 --> 12:47.436
What's up, fellas?

12:47.536 --> 12:49.803
Rusty James, where you been?

12:49.955 --> 12:51.355
Where were you?

12:53.042 --> 12:56.175
I was at Patty's.
What's it to you, huh?

12:56.670 --> 12:59.070
Nothing, Rusty James. Nothing.

12:59.381 --> 13:01.283
You're not expecting to find
Steve here, are you?

13:01.383 --> 13:05.955
- Why do you put up with that wimp?
- I've known him since kindergarten.

13:06.055 --> 13:08.582
You've got a bad habit of getting
attached to people, man.

13:08.682 --> 13:10.015
Yep. Let's go.

13:34.124 --> 13:35.457
Where's Steve?

13:38.963 --> 13:40.430
Maybe he's late.

14:11.912 --> 14:16.066
Yeah, it looks like we're gonna
have to fight ourselves, huh?

14:16.166 --> 14:17.366
Rusty James.

14:19.628 --> 14:21.561
Ha! Fucking Steve, man.

14:28.888 --> 14:30.621
We want Rusty James!

14:31.265 --> 14:32.365
I'm here!

14:34.351 --> 14:36.018
Not for long, punk.

14:37.855 --> 14:42.051
- Careful, he's been popping pills.
- I hate fighting hopped-up people.

14:42.151 --> 14:44.951
Scum. I hear you are looking for me.

14:45.112 --> 14:46.512
Come on, ducky.

14:47.406 --> 14:50.059
Take a fucking swing at me, man,
so I can just... Come here...

14:50.159 --> 14:52.728
- Take a swing at you?
- Come on!

14:52.828 --> 14:54.814
Come on, man! Take a swing at me!

14:54.914 --> 14:57.447
Gonna fucking cut you to pieces!

15:02.004 --> 15:03.104
Let's go.

15:15.643 --> 15:17.510
Go for the knife, man!

15:19.021 --> 15:22.221
Come on, Rusty!
Beat the fuck out of him!

16:52.740 --> 16:53.840
Scumbag!

16:54.616 --> 16:58.437
What is this?
Another glorious battle for the kingdom?

16:58.537 --> 17:01.273
Hey, man.
I thought you were gone for good.

17:01.373 --> 17:02.942
I thought we had a treaty.

17:03.042 --> 17:04.909
Look out, Rusty James!

17:06.795 --> 17:09.395
You're one dead cat, Rusty James!

17:23.145 --> 17:27.383
- You gotta keep still.
- You're gonna be OK. Just stay still.

17:27.483 --> 17:28.950
Don't move.

17:29.443 --> 17:30.803
You pissed off at me, man?

17:30.903 --> 17:35.303
No, don't talk. You'll be all right.
I'll take care of you.

17:56.011 --> 17:59.678
It's a little bit late for you,
isn't it, Steve?

18:01.517 --> 18:04.517
- Better get on home, boy.
- Yes, sir.

18:06.438 --> 18:10.438
You know, I'd watch the company I kept
if I were you.

18:15.572 --> 18:17.474
I really thought
he'd left town for good.

18:17.574 --> 18:20.602
Yeah, maybe he missed you
too much, man.

18:20.702 --> 18:23.835
Maybe he'd to come back
just to see you.

18:29.211 --> 18:33.278
You know, we'd all be better off
if you'd stayed gone.

18:40.973 --> 18:42.073
I got him!

18:42.766 --> 18:45.499
- I got him!
- Lay him right down.

18:45.978 --> 18:48.978
- OK. Easy, easy.
- Put him down easy.

18:50.357 --> 18:53.177
Oh, my God, he's bleeding!
He's bleeding everywhere.

18:53.277 --> 18:56.744
Keep him still.
All right, just hold him now.

19:02.828 --> 19:05.695
What are you gonna do?
Do something!

19:07.374 --> 19:10.441
- Where's the old man?
- He ain't home.

19:10.586 --> 19:12.519
Why don't you help him?

19:17.718 --> 19:19.918
I'm just gonna take a look.

19:20.304 --> 19:22.437
Here, take a swig of this.

19:24.892 --> 19:26.759
That's a lot of blood.

19:27.853 --> 19:28.953
Oh, fuck!

19:34.985 --> 19:36.085
Fuck!

19:38.030 --> 19:41.363
What are you doin'?
That must hurt!

19:42.451 --> 19:44.518
He oughta go to a doctor!

19:44.786 --> 19:46.833
He's been hurt
worse than this.

19:47.234 --> 19:50.192
That could get infected!
Don't touch it.

19:50.292 --> 19:51.825
Relax. All right?

19:52.920 --> 19:55.387
They'd have to cut my side off.

19:56.340 --> 19:59.868
- Where'd you go, man?
- I went to California.

19:59.968 --> 20:01.768
Stay down, all right?

20:03.180 --> 20:05.513
Fuck. California's nice, huh?

20:05.974 --> 20:08.293
What do you think California's like?

20:08.393 --> 20:11.296
Like all that shit you see
in the movies, man.

20:11.396 --> 20:14.463
Blondes walking around.
The Beach Boys.

20:15.692 --> 20:16.959
Palm trees...

20:18.195 --> 20:21.014
The ocean, man.
How was the ocean? Huh?

20:21.114 --> 20:23.600
- Yeah, I didn't get to the ocean.
- No?

20:23.700 --> 20:27.688
No, I didn't get to the ocean.
California got in the way.

20:27.788 --> 20:28.888
Yeah?

20:31.333 --> 20:36.000
California got in the way?
Thought California was on the coast.

20:36.755 --> 20:38.422
Don't talk so much.

20:40.634 --> 20:42.967
Come on, Steve! Cut the shit!

20:44.263 --> 20:46.330
It's not bleeding as bad.

20:57.484 --> 20:59.151
He looks different.

21:02.030 --> 21:03.830
I think it's the tan.

21:05.784 --> 21:09.384
Yeah, I guess
you get a tan in California, huh?

21:10.789 --> 21:12.656
What's wrong with him?

21:13.583 --> 21:17.183
He goes deaf sometimes.
He's colour blind, too.

21:17.296 --> 21:20.866
A lot of people are colour blind.
It's no big deal.

21:20.966 --> 21:23.869
He looks so old.
I forget he's just 21.

21:23.969 --> 21:25.969
Yeah, that's pretty old.

21:27.180 --> 21:29.180
No, he looks really old.

21:30.309 --> 21:32.309
Like... 25 or something.

21:38.650 --> 21:41.303
Steve, you know what,
I've been thinking.

21:41.403 --> 21:45.870
I think that when I get older
I'm gonna look a lot like him.

21:46.033 --> 21:47.133
No way.

21:48.952 --> 21:51.419
What? Tell me what's different.

21:53.206 --> 21:54.673
For one thing...

21:56.168 --> 21:57.835
The Motorcycle Boy?

21:59.755 --> 22:02.288
I never know what he's thinking.

22:03.717 --> 22:05.050
But you, ha...

22:06.887 --> 22:09.620
I always know what you're thinking.

22:19.608 --> 22:20.941
Russell James?

23:08.907 --> 23:10.974
I really missed you, man.

23:11.410 --> 23:13.979
I thought you were gone for good.

23:14.079 --> 23:16.412
Not me, man.
I got homesick.

23:25.799 --> 23:28.535
'You'll notice that the students
are working on the machines.

23:28.635 --> 23:30.912
'I want you to learn
how they are dressed.

23:31.012 --> 23:34.583
'One of the most important aspects
of safety is eye protection.

23:34.683 --> 23:39.016
'State law requires us
to furnish you with eye protection.

23:39.479 --> 23:43.091
'It's probably one of the most important
requirements that we teach all year.

23:43.191 --> 23:47.429
'After all, safety is the number one thing
we try to get over in shop.

23:47.529 --> 23:51.350
'Regarding eye protection,
we have three devices that we use -

23:51.450 --> 23:54.269
'your face shield, your eye goggles... '

23:54.369 --> 23:57.439
talking and she made us copy it
like a million times.

23:57.539 --> 24:00.806
- What?
- I was explaining to this girl...

24:10.218 --> 24:12.218
What are you doing here?

24:13.638 --> 24:16.124
Those are my mother's cigarettes.
What are you doing?

24:16.224 --> 24:20.087
You know, when I was a girl,
my boyfriend took me places.

24:20.187 --> 24:22.054
- Mother!
- Hurry up!

24:22.564 --> 24:24.925
Listen, listen,
I'll take you somewhere, babe.

24:25.025 --> 24:26.643
Don't worry.
It never mattered.

24:26.844 --> 24:28.970
We'll go to that
Matoaka concert tonight.

24:29.070 --> 24:31.070
Then maybe afterwards...

24:31.323 --> 24:35.590
Maybe afterwards we'll...
you know, go somewhere private.

24:35.869 --> 24:38.188
You can't afford the tickets.
It doesn't matter.

24:38.288 --> 24:40.148
No, no! I'll get some money.

24:40.248 --> 24:44.027
Then, you know, just get dolled up
and don't worry about that.

24:44.127 --> 24:46.613
I'll come by and pick you up
around seven or eight.

24:46.713 --> 24:47.813
OK.

24:56.723 --> 24:57.823
Patty!

24:58.934 --> 25:00.467
Get in the house!

25:01.645 --> 25:03.112
See you tonight.

25:22.749 --> 25:24.067
- Hi.
- Move it!

25:24.167 --> 25:26.445
Just fucking move it.
What are you?

25:26.545 --> 25:27.645
Charming.

25:30.382 --> 25:32.367
What is this, huh?
What is this?

25:32.467 --> 25:36.496
He just gets back, you're already
hanging around bugging with him. Why?

25:36.596 --> 25:38.996
Why do you dislike me so much?

25:40.475 --> 25:43.462
I mean, I've always tried
to be your friend.

25:43.562 --> 25:47.924
I didn't say I dislike you. I just don't like
substitute teachers living in my building.

25:48.024 --> 25:49.291
What is this?

25:49.651 --> 25:52.554
Just cos you read the same books
as him? It doesn't mean shit!

25:52.654 --> 25:54.187
It means nothing!

25:54.906 --> 25:57.392
You don't know him.
You don't know him.

25:57.492 --> 25:59.060
You know nothing, man!

25:59.160 --> 26:00.260
I know.

26:02.414 --> 26:05.347
You're just another one of his chicks.

26:06.209 --> 26:09.529
He don't like you
any more than the rest of 'em.

26:09.629 --> 26:11.562
He doesn't like me now.

26:12.215 --> 26:13.315
Period.

26:19.014 --> 26:20.614
What's the matter?

26:22.767 --> 26:24.234
You shooting up?

26:27.230 --> 26:28.963
Fucking heroin, man!

26:30.609 --> 26:32.844
Me and him, we never did dope.

26:32.944 --> 26:36.097
It ruined the gangs,
it ruined everything.

26:36.197 --> 26:40.977
If I ever caught my girlfriend doing
that shit, I'd break her fucking arm!

26:41.077 --> 26:42.344
Only her arm?

26:47.834 --> 26:50.967
I wish he would show me
that much mercy.

26:59.054 --> 27:00.987
I'm not hooked, though.

27:02.182 --> 27:06.249
You see, I just thought
it might help me a little bit.

27:06.353 --> 27:08.820
I thought he was gone for good.

27:09.522 --> 27:10.989
And I was wrong.

27:14.361 --> 27:15.828
But I was right.

27:16.029 --> 27:18.496
No, no, no, no! You were wrong.

27:19.616 --> 27:23.019
You're wrong.
You're fucking wrong, man! He's back!

27:23.119 --> 27:24.919
Always talking crazy!

27:43.682 --> 27:44.782
Poor kid!

27:48.311 --> 27:52.757
Looks like you're messed up
all the time now, one way or the other.

27:52.857 --> 27:53.957
I'm OK.

27:57.445 --> 28:00.181
- Let's go get a bite to eat.
- Hey.

28:00.281 --> 28:01.681
- What?
- Hey.

28:12.001 --> 28:13.194
- Hey!
- What?

28:13.294 --> 28:15.030
- Hey.
- I'm all right.

28:15.130 --> 28:16.263
Hey... Why?

28:19.008 --> 28:20.808
- About what?
- Why?

28:21.970 --> 28:23.637
- Oh, fuck!
- Hey.

28:24.305 --> 28:28.038
Hey! Why? Why?
No, no. Don't tell me "fuck". Why?

28:29.310 --> 28:30.410
Huh?

28:32.313 --> 28:35.980
- Let's get something to eat.
- Talk to me. Why?

28:37.777 --> 28:39.444
- Why?
- Why what?

28:41.573 --> 28:44.976
Why are you fucked up all the time,
one way or another?

28:45.076 --> 28:46.176
Huh?

28:49.706 --> 28:50.973
I don't know.

29:07.974 --> 29:09.574
Hey, sweetie. Hey!

29:37.045 --> 29:38.845
Both of you are home?

29:40.965 --> 29:43.034
Hey, Dad,
you got any money I can borrow?

29:43.134 --> 29:45.745
Haven't seen you for quite some time.

29:45.845 --> 29:48.045
I was home last night, Dad.

29:48.348 --> 29:49.815
I didn't notice.

29:50.934 --> 29:52.934
I need some money, Pops.

29:55.313 --> 29:57.513
Are you ill, Russell James?

29:58.107 --> 30:00.307
I got cut in a knife fight.

30:01.152 --> 30:03.152
- Yeah, really?
- Yeah.

30:04.697 --> 30:05.797
Really?

30:10.578 --> 30:12.778
Strange lives you two lead.

30:13.540 --> 30:14.740
Yeah, right.

30:15.708 --> 30:19.708
Strange? At least I ain't
a lawyer on welfare. Right?

30:23.132 --> 30:24.232
Thanks.

30:26.010 --> 30:27.610
Lawyer on welfare.

30:29.055 --> 30:31.922
Hey, how are you?
How was your trip?

30:32.141 --> 30:33.941
I went to California.

30:35.645 --> 30:38.112
- How was California?
- Huh...

30:39.440 --> 30:42.010
- It was one laugh after another.
- California?

30:42.110 --> 30:43.928
Even better than here.

30:44.028 --> 30:46.961
- I don't know.
- Oh, boy. Oh really?

30:48.283 --> 30:51.561
No, Dad. I was there.
You wanna compare notes, Dad?

30:51.661 --> 30:53.128
- Huh?
- Nah...

30:54.372 --> 30:57.442
- OK. That's it! That's it!
- No, no, no, no.

30:57.542 --> 31:00.528
Hey, come on, guys.
Cut the shit, will you? Cut it out.

31:00.628 --> 31:03.031
- Cut it out!
- That's it! That's it!

31:03.131 --> 31:05.464
You're not gonna have it, no!

31:06.175 --> 31:07.442
Come on, Dad.

31:10.221 --> 31:11.488
Hey! No more!

31:12.765 --> 31:13.865
No more.

31:15.101 --> 31:17.634
You're exactly like your mother.

31:18.354 --> 31:19.821
Russell James...

31:21.441 --> 31:24.308
I want you to please be more careful.

31:25.737 --> 31:29.974
You know that chick, Cassandra,
I saw her, she said she wasn't hooked.

31:30.074 --> 31:31.807
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

31:32.744 --> 31:34.477
Well, I believe her.

31:34.579 --> 31:36.179
- You do?
- Sure.

31:37.957 --> 31:40.819
You know what happened to people
who didn't believe Cassandra?

31:40.919 --> 31:44.252
Yeah. The Greeks got 'em.
Know what I mean?

31:45.006 --> 31:47.406
- What?
- The Greeks got 'em.

31:48.676 --> 31:53.409
Man, what the fuck did the Greeks
have to do with anything, huh?

31:54.807 --> 31:58.674
You think I care what the Greeks?
No, I don't care.

31:59.687 --> 32:03.341
- I don't give a shit what the Greeks...
- Rusty James? Will you do me a favour?

32:03.441 --> 32:05.574
- What?
- Come over here.

32:10.365 --> 32:12.767
Let's have a little more respect
around here from now on, huh?

32:12.867 --> 32:13.893
Fuck you.

32:13.993 --> 32:16.104
No, I'm only kidding.
I'm glad you're back.

32:16.204 --> 32:17.856
- Really.
- Come here, come here!

32:17.956 --> 32:20.689
- Come on!
- I hold on your pants!

32:21.167 --> 32:23.167
'Time is a funny thing.'

32:24.170 --> 32:26.503
Time is a very peculiar item.

32:27.048 --> 32:29.742
You see, when you're young,
you're a kid, you got time.

32:29.842 --> 32:32.109
You've got nothing but time.

32:33.221 --> 32:37.500
Throw away a couple of years here,
a couple of years there...

32:37.600 --> 32:39.867
It doesn't matter. You know?

32:41.938 --> 32:44.507
The older you get you say,
"Jesus, how much I got?"

32:44.607 --> 32:49.607
I got thirty-five summers left,
think about it. Thirty-five summers.

33:17.306 --> 33:21.506
Smokey, man, you sure come up
with some good ideas, bro.

33:22.186 --> 33:24.653
Man, that is what I'm here for.

33:25.940 --> 33:29.207
- Let's get fucked up!
- Where's the guys?

35:05.915 --> 35:07.442
- Hey!
- Hung over again?

35:07.542 --> 35:09.742
No, I'm sick. Really. Feel.

35:11.420 --> 35:12.947
Wanna write me out a late pass?

35:13.047 --> 35:15.199
Mr Harrigan wants to see you
in his office.

35:15.299 --> 35:18.099
Oh, yeah?
Great. What does he want?

35:18.302 --> 35:19.702
He'll tell you.

35:22.056 --> 35:25.456
Rusty, you've been in here
to see me before.

35:26.394 --> 35:29.127
Is this your daughter, Mr Harrigan?

35:29.272 --> 35:33.051
- She's kinda cute.
- You start at Cleveland next Monday.

35:33.151 --> 35:35.351
You're suspended till then.

35:35.903 --> 35:38.890
Fine! Suspend the hell outta me!
You think I care?

35:38.990 --> 35:42.727
The only reason I'm going to this fucking
school is cos my friends are here, man.

35:42.827 --> 35:46.439
Think I give a shit? I don't give a shit!
I don't give a shit, man!

35:46.539 --> 35:49.072
You suspend me?
I fucking quit!

36:05.766 --> 36:07.033
Bye! Call me!

36:07.685 --> 36:09.152
Hi, Rusty James!

36:10.688 --> 36:12.621
Boy, is she mad at you.

36:15.401 --> 36:16.501
Hey!

36:19.155 --> 36:20.688
What's up, Patty?

36:22.491 --> 36:24.560
Hey, what's the matter, babe? Huh?

36:24.660 --> 36:28.793
What's the matter?
Please, don't touch me, Rusty James.

36:30.625 --> 36:33.194
What's the matter?
What are you so upset about?

36:33.294 --> 36:34.394
All right.

36:37.048 --> 36:39.617
I heard all about your little party.

36:39.717 --> 36:41.035
- What?
- Up at the lake.

36:41.135 --> 36:42.235
So what?

36:42.595 --> 36:46.207
Marsha Kirk was there.
She told me all about it.

36:46.307 --> 36:48.960
What's a little party have to do
with you and me, babe? Come on!

36:49.060 --> 36:50.527
Oh, yes! Please!

36:53.314 --> 36:55.758
- What's the matter?
- How's your girlfriend doing?

36:55.858 --> 36:59.991
- What are you talking about?
- The black-haired tramp!

37:00.363 --> 37:03.696
What's she have to do
with anything, Patty?

37:03.908 --> 37:05.241
Come on, babe.

37:05.576 --> 37:07.509
You treat me like shit!

37:08.412 --> 37:11.065
You do! You fuck other girls
and all you do is shit on me!

37:11.165 --> 37:14.694
Come on. Your little sister's right here.
I don't fuck other girls.

37:14.794 --> 37:17.994
- You're the girl I love.
- Don't! Don't!

37:18.506 --> 37:19.839
Come on, babe.

37:20.800 --> 37:21.900
Look.

37:22.176 --> 37:26.176
Just go fuck yourself. All right?
You are an asshole!

37:29.433 --> 37:32.233
All right, fuck you, too!
Fuck you!

37:32.853 --> 37:34.881
What the fuck did I do?
I didn't do nothing!

37:34.981 --> 37:36.081
Bullshit!

37:39.777 --> 37:42.805
I don't ever wanna see
your face again.

37:42.905 --> 37:46.172
Good! You won't have to,
you little bitch!

37:50.079 --> 37:51.179
Fuck you!

38:31.329 --> 38:32.429
Hey, bro.

38:34.874 --> 38:36.341
What's going on?

38:36.917 --> 38:39.117
- Got a cigarette?
- Here.

38:41.964 --> 38:45.993
Hey, let's do something tonight.
Let's just get the fuck outta here.

38:46.093 --> 38:49.330
Go across the bridge over to the strip
or something, you know.

38:49.430 --> 38:52.563
You wanna do that?
What are you reading?

38:52.933 --> 38:56.133
There's a picture of me
in this magazine.

38:56.937 --> 38:58.037
Oh, nice.

39:01.734 --> 39:04.667
Is there an article in here about you?

39:05.112 --> 39:09.684
No. Some photographer took my picture
when I was out in California.

39:09.784 --> 39:11.984
That's a good picture, man.

39:12.244 --> 39:15.273
Wait until those guys
hear about this shit, man.

39:15.373 --> 39:19.652
No, don't. Rusty James,
I'd rather you didn't tell anyone.

39:19.752 --> 39:22.321
I mean, God knows
it's gonna get around soon enough.

39:22.421 --> 39:23.521
All right.

39:23.756 --> 39:27.785
I'm tired of this "Robin Hood"
and "Pied Piper" bullshit.

39:27.885 --> 39:31.247
I'd just as soon stay a neighbourhood
novelty, if it's all the same to you.

39:31.347 --> 39:32.447
You know?

39:34.141 --> 39:37.211
I know what you mean
when you say the "Pied Piper".

39:37.311 --> 39:40.923
Those fucking guys
would've followed you anywhere.

39:41.023 --> 39:43.156
They probably still would.

39:44.026 --> 39:46.693
- Think about it.
- "Pied Piper".

39:46.987 --> 39:49.720
What do you mean, the "Pied Piper"?

39:52.868 --> 39:55.401
Well, you said it not me, but...

39:56.288 --> 39:59.755
but I get what you mean, man.
I mean, fuck...

40:01.085 --> 40:04.655
Like the guy with the flute, man.
They would've followed you anywhere.

40:04.755 --> 40:06.155
I have a flute?

40:09.301 --> 40:11.968
- Like in the movie, man.
- Yeah.

40:13.264 --> 40:17.397
They'd all follow me...
to the river, huh, and jump in.

40:23.858 --> 40:25.125
I don't know.

40:26.485 --> 40:28.952
Yeah, they probably would, man.

40:30.322 --> 40:34.922
If you're gonna lead people,
you have to have somewhere to go.

40:50.092 --> 40:53.954
Hey, what are you gonna do?
Work me over with your night stick?

40:54.054 --> 40:55.706
Why'd he come back?

40:55.806 --> 40:59.418
He lives here, man. You live somewhere,
he lives somewhere.

40:59.518 --> 41:02.185
He knew better
than to come back.

41:03.939 --> 41:07.406
Hey, this is his home, man.
Know what I mean?

41:09.987 --> 41:11.387
Motorcycle Boy.

41:12.615 --> 41:14.282
The Motorcycle Boy.

41:14.825 --> 41:16.936
You think you know about him, huh?

41:17.036 --> 41:18.136
Yeah.

41:20.498 --> 41:24.026
I don't understand why
you hate him so much. Huh?

41:24.126 --> 41:28.864
I hate him so much, because you kids
think he's something he's not.

41:28.964 --> 41:30.231
He's no hero.

41:31.175 --> 41:33.369
Like you are?
Like you're a hero, huh?

41:33.469 --> 41:35.269
You're a hero, right?

41:36.096 --> 41:37.696
Come on, let's go.

41:41.894 --> 41:43.227
Let's go, man.

42:41.912 --> 42:44.445
You really like this river, huh?

42:45.040 --> 42:49.240
- It's a cool river.
- It goes all the way to the ocean.

42:50.838 --> 42:51.938
Yeah.

42:53.757 --> 42:56.024
- Here.
- I don't want any.

42:57.303 --> 42:59.036
Steve, take a drink.

43:01.724 --> 43:06.212
- This stuff tastes awful.
- It'll get you where you wanna go.

43:06.312 --> 43:08.589
Remind me to chew gum
before I go home, OK?

43:08.689 --> 43:09.822
Yeah, sure.

43:10.608 --> 43:14.094
Why do you drink so much?
You can't stand your father drinking.

43:14.194 --> 43:17.431
I don't drink so much, man!
You're full of it!

43:17.531 --> 43:22.264
If my father finds out I've been drinking,
I'm gonna get killed.

43:45.142 --> 43:47.253
Looking good.
Looking good.

43:47.353 --> 43:49.486
Kid, give me that balloon.

43:54.860 --> 43:56.993
♪ In the middle of a dream

44:01.450 --> 44:03.917
♪ I heard somebody call my name

44:07.831 --> 44:10.401
♪ I was afraid I'd make you cry...

44:10.501 --> 44:13.821
I don't suppose
I could come with you, huh?

44:13.921 --> 44:15.521
No, not this time.

44:21.011 --> 44:22.744
He doesn't like her.

44:24.390 --> 44:26.790
We had some nice trips though.

44:26.934 --> 44:29.267
Yeah, we had some nice trips.

44:41.156 --> 44:45.489
She's a junkie. I don't know
what the fuck he sees in her.

44:46.537 --> 44:50.004
- She's beautiful.
- She's a lost cause, man.

44:51.250 --> 44:52.583
Let's go, huh?

44:53.711 --> 44:57.711
- She is a knockout.
- Come on, let's get outta here!

45:02.136 --> 45:03.869
Yo, bro, let's blow!

45:08.308 --> 45:09.908
Let's go. Come on.

45:27.453 --> 45:30.120
- Watch it, guy!
- Out of my way!

45:39.047 --> 45:41.314
Wow, it's so cool over here.

45:41.550 --> 45:44.787
I hate our neighbourhood.
There's no colour.

45:44.887 --> 45:46.872
You don't see colours, do you?

45:46.972 --> 45:49.958
You're deaf too,
Rusty James told me that.

45:50.058 --> 45:52.725
What does it all look like to you?

45:55.439 --> 45:58.592
Black and white TV
with the sound turned low.

45:58.692 --> 46:03.359
I thought colour-blind people
couldn't see red, green or brown.

46:09.203 --> 46:13.003
It seems to me like
I can remember seeing colours.

46:13.707 --> 46:15.640
It was a long time ago.

46:16.293 --> 46:17.393
Yeah?

46:18.629 --> 46:21.362
I stopped being a kid when I was 5.

46:22.466 --> 46:26.533
Yeah. I wonder when
I'm gonna stop being a little kid.

46:29.056 --> 46:30.156
Not ever.

46:34.311 --> 46:37.578
I saw Mother
when I was out in California.

46:43.695 --> 46:45.495
You mean she's alive?

46:47.032 --> 46:48.132
Huh?

46:54.122 --> 46:55.789
In California, huh?

47:16.603 --> 47:19.270
You know, I saw her on television.

47:20.065 --> 47:24.511
I was sitting in a comfortable bar,
minding my own business.

47:24.611 --> 47:27.014
They had one of those award shows
on the TV.

47:27.114 --> 47:29.433
When the camera went over
the audience, I saw her.

47:29.533 --> 47:30.633
Yeah?

47:30.993 --> 47:33.312
And I knew if I went
out to California, I'd find her.

47:33.412 --> 47:35.679
I thought she was dead, man.

47:35.831 --> 47:38.898
Now I know
why the old man always said,

47:40.002 --> 47:42.738
"You look exactly like your mother."

47:42.838 --> 47:43.938
Yeah?

47:45.299 --> 47:47.766
I must look like her, too, huh?

47:51.346 --> 47:54.679
She's living
with a fucking movie producer!

47:55.392 --> 47:57.725
She was then... I don't know.

48:00.272 --> 48:01.372
Was she?

48:02.524 --> 48:04.259
Was she glad to see you?

48:04.359 --> 48:08.514
Oh, yeah, she was. She said it was
the funniest thing she ever heard of.

48:08.614 --> 48:11.281
She wanted me to move in with her.

48:14.411 --> 48:17.211
California is a...
It's very funny.

48:18.165 --> 48:20.898
It's even... even better than here.

48:22.377 --> 48:24.310
California's nice, huh?

48:25.547 --> 48:26.680
Nice place?

48:27.215 --> 48:29.082
California's like a...

48:32.596 --> 48:36.596
California's like a beautiful,
wild girl on heroin...

48:39.436 --> 48:43.703
who's high as a kite,
thinking she's on top of the world,

48:44.566 --> 48:48.699
not knowing she's dying
even if you show her the marks.

48:53.742 --> 48:58.209
Hey, man. It's so cool over here.
I really dig it over here.

48:59.790 --> 49:03.523
The lights! All these people, man!
I love crowds.

49:04.962 --> 49:08.962
You know, I don't know why.
Maybe it's because...

49:10.300 --> 49:14.833
I can't stand being left alone.
I really can't. It fucking...

49:15.597 --> 49:19.597
I feel like I'm getting choked,
you know what I mean?

49:20.060 --> 49:23.672
I feel like I'm being choked.
I can't deal with it.

49:23.772 --> 49:26.967
See, when you were two years old
and I was six,

49:27.067 --> 49:29.334
our mother decided to leave.

49:30.112 --> 49:35.579
She took me with her. When the old man
found out, he went on a 3-day drunk.

49:36.201 --> 49:39.001
He told me
it was the first time...

49:39.162 --> 49:43.029
He told me it was the first time
he ever got drunk.

49:43.792 --> 49:45.360
Come on, get off me.

49:45.460 --> 49:47.446
Go ahead. What were you saying?

49:47.546 --> 49:49.531
Hey, sweetie. Like a date?

49:49.631 --> 49:50.866
What were you saying?

49:50.966 --> 49:54.786
I said he told me it was the first time
he ever got drunk.

49:54.886 --> 49:59.086
Anyway, he left you alone
in the house for those 3 days.

49:59.808 --> 50:04.141
We didn't live where we do now.
It was a very large house.

50:04.688 --> 50:05.788
And...

50:08.608 --> 50:11.929
Anyway, what happened was
eventually she dumped me.

50:12.029 --> 50:14.629
They took me back to the old man.

50:15.657 --> 50:19.457
He sobered up enough
to go home. And I supposed...

50:21.913 --> 50:24.983
That's how you developed
your fear of being alone.

50:25.083 --> 50:27.483
You never told me that before.

50:30.964 --> 50:32.064
No?

50:33.091 --> 50:35.891
I didn't think it'd do you any good.

50:41.183 --> 50:42.283
Look it!

50:43.643 --> 50:45.176
Get outta my way!

50:47.355 --> 50:52.219
- Hey ugly, get the fuck outta my way.
- What are you doin'? Don't do that.

50:52.319 --> 50:56.652
- Steve, don't bug me!
- Just don't go pounding on people!

50:57.157 --> 51:00.602
- I'm not in the mood for you, man.
- Why are you pounding on people?

51:00.702 --> 51:03.105
I'm not in the mood, all right?

51:03.205 --> 51:06.938
You think it would've crossed
his mind to tell me

51:07.125 --> 51:09.403
that he saw our mother
when he went to California?

51:09.503 --> 51:12.836
- Who?
- If it was me, I would've told him.

51:14.257 --> 51:19.390
- I'm his brother. I've a right to know.
- What are you talking about?

51:46.331 --> 51:48.198
How you doin', my man?

51:48.458 --> 51:50.858
I'm sick and tired of... Help!

52:27.789 --> 52:29.856
He's a deep motherfucker.

52:30.625 --> 52:34.892
I'm gonna be just like him, too.
I'm gonna look like him.

52:36.006 --> 52:38.739
You ain't gonna never be like that.

52:39.593 --> 52:40.827
How do you know?

52:40.927 --> 52:43.747
What the fuck do you know?
I might look like him.

52:43.847 --> 52:47.580
You ain't gonna be like that, man.
He's a prince.

52:48.602 --> 52:52.535
That's right.
Give it time, buddy boy. Give it time.

52:54.816 --> 52:59.283
Know what he's like? Royalty in exile.
You know what I mean?

53:03.033 --> 53:05.633
Isn't there anything he can't do?

53:21.593 --> 53:23.460
Officer, I salute you!

53:41.238 --> 53:42.571
I'm fucked up.

53:46.952 --> 53:50.147
Rusty, let's get outta here.
Come on, let's go.

53:50.247 --> 53:51.347
Wake up!

53:53.583 --> 53:55.250
- Wake up!
- Fuck!

53:56.711 --> 53:58.311
Don't go to sleep.

54:07.013 --> 54:08.346
Where'd he go?

54:09.224 --> 54:11.157
Come on! Where'd he go?

54:20.318 --> 54:22.451
Where's the living legend?

54:24.864 --> 54:27.997
He probably swiped a cycle
and took off.

54:31.663 --> 54:35.863
I thought we were sticking
to the middle of the streets.

54:36.126 --> 54:37.526
I'm in a hurry!

54:39.337 --> 54:42.741
- If you're scared, I should be terrified.
- I ain't scared, man!

54:42.841 --> 54:45.641
This place just gives me the creeps.

54:46.845 --> 54:50.512
I just don't like dark, empty alleys.
All right?

54:51.099 --> 54:52.832
It's the same thing.

54:55.312 --> 54:59.645
- Why are you whispering?
- I'm not whispering. Slow down.

55:08.283 --> 55:10.016
Oh, God, we're dead.

55:10.785 --> 55:12.385
You got any bread?

55:14.497 --> 55:18.497
What? He's not gonna bash us
even if we've got bread?

55:19.044 --> 55:23.577
- Sure, that's it.
- Progressive country, integrated mugging.

55:24.758 --> 55:27.425
I ain't got no fucking money, man!

55:27.969 --> 55:30.622
We don't want any trouble.
Really, man.

55:30.722 --> 55:34.389
We really don't want any trouble.
Fuck off, man!

55:35.769 --> 55:36.969
Rusty James!

55:40.940 --> 55:42.140
Rusty James!

55:58.583 --> 55:59.783
Rusty James!

56:09.636 --> 56:12.169
- Six dollars.
- What's he got?

56:12.305 --> 56:13.505
Rusty James!

56:14.391 --> 56:16.458
Something for cigarettes.

56:17.769 --> 56:19.502
That's all he's got.

56:21.064 --> 56:22.464
Son of a bitch!

57:15.785 --> 57:16.885
Patty...

57:17.579 --> 57:20.512
You were the only one,
I swear, baby.

57:28.131 --> 57:31.331
A toast to Rusty James,
a very cool dude.

57:33.428 --> 57:34.828
To Rusty James!

57:53.490 --> 57:55.223
Rusty James, please!

57:57.952 --> 57:59.052
Steve!

58:08.922 --> 58:10.789
Come on, motherfucker!

59:05.562 --> 59:07.495
- Rusty James?
- What?

59:08.982 --> 59:11.315
Rusty James, you still alive?

59:12.068 --> 59:13.601
No. I don't know.

59:17.699 --> 59:18.832
My stomach!

59:27.875 --> 59:31.608
What happened to those guys
that creamed us, man?

59:34.215 --> 59:38.882
He bashed 'em. Clobbered 'em.
He nailed one of 'em really good.

59:39.387 --> 59:42.454
- The other took off.
- Way to go, man.

59:44.350 --> 59:45.450
Way to go.

59:50.148 --> 59:53.843
You're going to the hospital
this time, I mean it.

59:53.943 --> 59:58.723
- When the rumbles were going on...
- Would you shut up about that?

59:58.823 --> 01:00:03.023
- Somebody was always getting mangled.
- I said shut up!

01:00:03.661 --> 01:00:05.328
You and your gangs!

01:00:06.664 --> 01:00:08.997
It was bullshit, Rusty James!

01:00:10.835 --> 01:00:13.635
It wasn't anything you think it was!

01:00:15.423 --> 01:00:18.868
- A bunch of punks killing each other!
- You don't know nothing.

01:00:18.968 --> 01:00:22.622
Don't tell me I don't know nothing.
You, tell him!

01:00:22.722 --> 01:00:24.055
You, tell him!

01:00:31.105 --> 01:00:32.772
It wasn't anything.

01:00:40.907 --> 01:00:42.007
You see?

01:00:42.700 --> 01:00:45.567
- What?
- You see? Did you hear him?

01:00:47.955 --> 01:00:51.222
Man, you must've thought
it was something.

01:00:52.001 --> 01:00:54.801
You were the fucking president, man.

01:00:56.923 --> 01:00:59.701
Yeah, well, you know,
it was fun at first.

01:00:59.801 --> 01:01:02.134
Then it got to be a big bore.

01:01:04.138 --> 01:01:06.416
You know, I managed to get credit
for ending the rumbles,

01:01:06.516 --> 01:01:11.116
simply because everyone knew
that I knew they were a big bore.

01:01:11.604 --> 01:01:13.548
They were gonna end anyway.

01:01:13.648 --> 01:01:17.715
- There was too many people...
- Don't say it was fun!

01:01:18.403 --> 01:01:19.736
It wasn't fun!

01:01:20.279 --> 01:01:23.412
I was speaking
from personal experience.

01:01:24.909 --> 01:01:29.709
I mean, most of them didn't think
it was fun when we had a fight.

01:01:32.083 --> 01:01:34.550
Most of them were scared stiff.

01:01:36.212 --> 01:01:40.145
Blind terror in a fight
can easily pass for courage.

01:01:41.551 --> 01:01:43.453
There was something about it,
I remember.

01:01:43.553 --> 01:01:45.622
You're just stupid enough
to have enjoyed it!

01:01:45.722 --> 01:01:49.189
- Fuck you!
- You remember something, Stevie.

01:01:50.852 --> 01:01:52.919
Loyalty is his only vice.

01:01:56.149 --> 01:01:57.675
The Motorcycle Boy!

01:01:57.775 --> 01:02:02.708
I wonder why somebody hasn't taken
a rifle and blown your head off.

01:02:04.532 --> 01:02:09.599
Even the most primitive society has
an innate respect for the insane.

01:02:20.798 --> 01:02:22.265
I wanna go home.

01:02:23.176 --> 01:02:26.309
Cheer up.
The gangs are gonna come back.

01:02:28.097 --> 01:02:31.564
And once they get
the dope off the streets...

01:02:31.976 --> 01:02:34.909
people will persist in joining things.

01:02:35.438 --> 01:02:37.905
You'll see the gangs come back.

01:02:39.567 --> 01:02:41.434
If you live that long.

01:03:07.512 --> 01:03:09.712
What's the matter with you?

01:03:10.848 --> 01:03:14.048
I ain't never seen you
sit still so long.

01:03:20.525 --> 01:03:23.458
How do you know
when someone's crazy?

01:03:29.242 --> 01:03:31.175
Well, you don't always.

01:03:32.578 --> 01:03:36.178
Depends on how many people
think they're crazy.

01:03:53.224 --> 01:03:54.324
Yeah!

01:03:59.188 --> 01:04:01.788
It's so fucking hot in here, man.

01:04:02.024 --> 01:04:04.177
Here comes your old lady,
Rusty James.

01:04:04.277 --> 01:04:05.810
- What?
- Patty.

01:04:05.945 --> 01:04:07.412
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:04:10.575 --> 01:04:13.775
- Hey, she means business.
- Coke, Benny.

01:04:15.079 --> 01:04:16.179
Shit.

01:04:22.795 --> 01:04:23.895
Thanks.

01:04:27.884 --> 01:04:30.151
- You looking for me?
- No.

01:04:34.223 --> 01:04:35.323
Hey, doll.

01:04:37.476 --> 01:04:38.576
Ah, shit.

01:04:41.022 --> 01:04:42.822
You really look nice.

01:04:47.069 --> 01:04:49.202
You look really beautiful.

01:05:03.336 --> 01:05:05.363
- How you doin'?
- Fine.

01:05:05.463 --> 01:05:09.196
- Did you know I've got a gift for you?
- For me?

01:05:09.425 --> 01:05:12.825
That was me
on my 5-year-old birthday party.

01:05:13.137 --> 01:05:15.804
I was good-looking even back then.

01:05:16.182 --> 01:05:17.282
Thank you.

01:05:19.393 --> 01:05:22.660
- You want something, Rusty James?
- What?

01:05:23.981 --> 01:05:25.381
Can I help you?

01:05:26.442 --> 01:05:29.242
Nah, I think we should step outside.

01:05:30.529 --> 01:05:32.862
I'm not gonna fight you, man.

01:05:33.282 --> 01:05:36.415
I just said...
Just go outside and talk.

01:05:39.914 --> 01:05:41.447
Look at you, man.

01:05:42.249 --> 01:05:43.449
Look at you.

01:05:44.126 --> 01:05:46.126
It wouldn't be fair now.

01:05:46.587 --> 01:05:49.407
You're not in any condition to fight.

01:05:49.507 --> 01:05:53.953
I told you, I didn't say nothing
about fighting. I don't wanna fight you.

01:05:54.053 --> 01:05:56.080
Did I say I wanted to fight you?

01:05:56.180 --> 01:05:58.380
I said, we'll go outside...

01:06:00.017 --> 01:06:02.817
And talk, communicate.
Get it, man?

01:06:10.069 --> 01:06:11.169
All right.

01:06:25.501 --> 01:06:30.907
Smokey, the other night when we were
out at the lake house with your cousin,

01:06:31.007 --> 01:06:33.407
and those chicks were there...

01:06:35.011 --> 01:06:38.211
Did you plan
for it to get back to Patty?

01:06:39.557 --> 01:06:42.293
Maybe she'd break up with me
and you could take over

01:06:42.393 --> 01:06:45.588
while I was still fucked up
from the fight?

01:06:45.688 --> 01:06:47.555
Look at me, goddammit!

01:06:47.940 --> 01:06:49.040
Did you?

01:06:52.278 --> 01:06:55.811
Well, I guess I did.
I kinda thought about it.

01:07:04.123 --> 01:07:08.523
I would've never been able
to think of something like that.

01:07:10.337 --> 01:07:11.437
I know.

01:07:17.261 --> 01:07:18.594
Rusty James...

01:07:21.015 --> 01:07:24.418
If there were still gangs around,
I'd be president and not you.

01:07:24.518 --> 01:07:26.718
You'd be second lieutenant.

01:07:29.231 --> 01:07:33.135
You might've made it a while
on the Motorcycle Boy's rep,

01:07:33.235 --> 01:07:36.222
but you ain't got
your brother's brains.

01:07:36.322 --> 01:07:38.922
You gotta be smart to run things.

01:07:41.202 --> 01:07:43.935
It's nothing personal, Rusty James,

01:07:44.497 --> 01:07:47.984
but nobody would follow you
into a gang fight.

01:07:48.084 --> 01:07:50.484
Because you get people killed.

01:07:50.836 --> 01:07:52.969
Nobody wants to be killed.

01:08:02.932 --> 01:08:06.252
I guess you're right.
Nobody wants to get killed.

01:08:06.352 --> 01:08:08.752
So you really like Patty, huh?

01:08:09.021 --> 01:08:11.354
- Huh? You like her?
- Yeah.

01:08:12.858 --> 01:08:16.658
Even if she wasn't your chick,
I'd still like her.

01:08:23.243 --> 01:08:26.911
- It's all yours, man.
- Don't flatter yourself.

01:08:29.375 --> 01:08:30.475
Hey, boys.

01:08:43.555 --> 01:08:46.542
Hey, man, you better be careful,
you know.

01:08:46.642 --> 01:08:50.837
That cop, Patterson, is looking
for just one excuse to get him, man.

01:08:50.938 --> 01:08:52.037
Yeah?

01:08:52.439 --> 01:08:54.591
I remember he beat me up once.

01:08:54.692 --> 01:08:58.095
Got me locked up in juvenile hall
for the weekend.

01:08:58.194 --> 01:09:01.062
He's been after both of us for years.

01:09:02.198 --> 01:09:03.999
He's a good cop, man.

01:09:05.953 --> 01:09:08.229
The Motorcycle Boy seems to be
his only bad point.

01:09:08.330 --> 01:09:11.063
He'll never get the Motorcycle Boy.

01:09:11.959 --> 01:09:13.826
- Never.
- Envy, man.

01:09:15.629 --> 01:09:17.162
It gotta be envy.

01:09:19.841 --> 01:09:23.162
- You seen him?
- Yeah, over at the pet store.

01:09:23.261 --> 01:09:27.416
- What was he doing there?
- Looking at the fish as far as I could tell.

01:09:27.515 --> 01:09:29.183
Those fucking fish!

01:09:30.269 --> 01:09:33.402
What is it
with those fucking fish, man?

01:10:06.055 --> 01:10:07.455
Hey, what's up?

01:10:08.515 --> 01:10:09.615
Hey!

01:10:11.602 --> 01:10:13.869
Hey, what's the matter, man?

01:10:14.605 --> 01:10:17.005
Really. You feeling all right?

01:10:21.070 --> 01:10:23.537
How come the tank is separated?

01:10:23.948 --> 01:10:25.815
These are rumble fish.

01:10:26.992 --> 01:10:28.894
They'd kill each other if they could.

01:10:28.994 --> 01:10:31.861
- Yeah?
- You boys gonna buy a fish?

01:10:33.374 --> 01:10:34.474
No.

01:10:36.585 --> 01:10:38.718
That's right, Rusty James.

01:10:38.921 --> 01:10:41.454
These are Siamese fighting fish.

01:10:42.675 --> 01:10:45.408
Watch this. If you lean a mirror...

01:10:46.971 --> 01:10:48.904
up against the glass...

01:10:53.644 --> 01:10:57.423
they try to kill themselves
fighting their own reflection.

01:10:57.523 --> 01:10:58.883
- That's pretty cool.
- Yeah?

01:10:58.983 --> 01:11:00.083
Try it.

01:11:01.193 --> 01:11:02.393
Right there.

01:11:03.487 --> 01:11:04.820
In the middle.

01:11:06.323 --> 01:11:08.590
Over that way. See that one?

01:11:10.869 --> 01:11:11.969
Yeah.

01:11:17.001 --> 01:11:19.987
I wonder if they'd act that way
in the river.

01:11:20.087 --> 01:11:25.220
I should close up now, boys.
I don't carry much cash. Really, I don't.

01:11:25.676 --> 01:11:27.343
Hey, we're looking.

01:11:29.346 --> 01:11:32.746
- I really dig the colours.
- The colours...

01:11:34.351 --> 01:11:36.151
The colours are cool.

01:11:38.981 --> 01:11:41.425
Makes me sorry
I can't see the colours.

01:11:41.525 --> 01:11:44.595
I never thought you were sorry
about anything.

01:11:44.695 --> 01:11:48.432
What's the big interest
in the pet store all of a sudden?

01:11:48.532 --> 01:11:51.132
They've been hanging around here.

01:11:52.453 --> 01:11:54.453
Take a look at the fish.

01:11:59.043 --> 01:12:01.776
You're crazy.
You're really crazy.

01:12:05.007 --> 01:12:07.910
And you know I've known about it
all along.

01:12:08.010 --> 01:12:10.343
But they belong in the river.

01:12:11.972 --> 01:12:16.877
I don't think they'd fight if they were
in the river, if they had room to live.

01:12:16.977 --> 01:12:20.177
Someone ought to get you
off the streets.

01:12:24.693 --> 01:12:28.093
Somebody ought to put the fish
in the river.

01:15:20.744 --> 01:15:24.022
- Why are you following me?
- I'm worried, bro.

01:15:24.122 --> 01:15:26.922
- Of what?
- I'm worried about you.

01:15:29.127 --> 01:15:31.860
Why have you been acting like this?

01:15:33.757 --> 01:15:36.890
Hey...
You think the old man's in there?

01:15:48.897 --> 01:15:49.997
Hey, Dad?

01:15:53.569 --> 01:15:54.669
Hey. Hey!

01:15:56.238 --> 01:15:59.838
It's great to see both of you again.
Huh? Yeah.

01:16:00.200 --> 01:16:01.300
Hey.

01:16:07.124 --> 01:16:10.191
I've been meaning
to ask you something.

01:16:11.670 --> 01:16:12.770
Yes?

01:16:18.051 --> 01:16:21.051
Our mother, is she crazy,
is she nuts?

01:16:26.810 --> 01:16:27.910
She's OK.

01:16:29.730 --> 01:16:30.830
I mean...

01:16:31.398 --> 01:16:33.425
What makes you ask
a question like that?

01:16:33.525 --> 01:16:36.525
Well, she just picked up and left, man.

01:16:37.195 --> 01:16:38.462
Yeah, well...

01:16:40.657 --> 01:16:41.990
Rusty James...

01:16:42.951 --> 01:16:47.231
Every now and then, a person comes along
with a different view of the world

01:16:47.331 --> 01:16:49.398
than does a usual person.

01:16:49.666 --> 01:16:51.799
It doesn't make 'em crazy.

01:16:53.295 --> 01:16:54.395
I mean...

01:16:54.880 --> 01:16:59.147
An acute perception,
I mean, that doesn't make you crazy.

01:16:59.509 --> 01:17:03.109
- Could you talk normal?
- However sometimes...

01:17:04.473 --> 01:17:07.873
it can drive you crazy,
an acute perception.

01:17:08.602 --> 01:17:10.921
I wish you'd talk normal cos...

01:17:11.021 --> 01:17:14.821
I don't understand
half the garbage you're saying.

01:17:15.692 --> 01:17:17.892
You know? Know what I mean?

01:17:18.945 --> 01:17:20.545
No, your mother...

01:17:22.866 --> 01:17:24.199
was not crazy.

01:17:25.744 --> 01:17:30.411
And neither, contrary to popular belief,
is your brother crazy.

01:17:31.208 --> 01:17:33.608
He's merely miscast in a play.

01:17:35.087 --> 01:17:39.620
He was born in the wrong era,
on the wrong side of the river,

01:17:42.552 --> 01:17:47.885
with the ability to be able to do
anything that he wants to do and, uh...

01:17:48.558 --> 01:17:51.691
and finding nothing
that he wants to do.

01:17:52.020 --> 01:17:54.020
- I mean nothing.
- OK.

01:17:55.399 --> 01:17:59.219
You don't understand me anymore,
do you? That's for sure, for sure.

01:17:59.319 --> 01:18:01.186
That's the difference.

01:18:02.989 --> 01:18:06.589
You never lost your mother.
I lost your mother.

01:18:11.289 --> 01:18:12.889
I think... that...

01:18:16.086 --> 01:18:19.553
I'm gonna be a lot like him
when I get older.

01:18:25.846 --> 01:18:28.046
You should pray to God not.

01:18:30.892 --> 01:18:32.225
You poor baby.

01:18:36.314 --> 01:18:38.447
- What?
- You poor child.

01:18:53.790 --> 01:18:54.890
Tab!

01:19:07.220 --> 01:19:09.753
Let's do something tonight, huh?

01:19:10.849 --> 01:19:14.049
Get some wine, chicks, party...
You down?

01:19:17.647 --> 01:19:20.759
I feel like I'm wasting my life,
waiting for something.

01:19:20.859 --> 01:19:22.392
Waiting for what?

01:19:23.612 --> 01:19:26.079
I wish I had a reason to leave.

01:19:32.746 --> 01:19:34.606
- Come on.
- What are you doin'?

01:19:34.706 --> 01:19:35.806
Come on.

01:19:36.666 --> 01:19:40.333
- What are you doin'?
- Gonna go for a ride. Sh!

01:19:43.048 --> 01:19:44.981
Do you think I'm crazy?

01:20:57.622 --> 01:21:01.022
Hey, you don't wanna stop here,
really, man.

01:21:01.293 --> 01:21:05.160
Don't worry about
those fucking fish, bro. Come on!

01:21:08.216 --> 01:21:10.683
The fish are all right, really.

01:21:16.391 --> 01:21:17.858
Where you going?

01:21:20.478 --> 01:21:22.611
Look, man. You need money?

01:21:23.648 --> 01:21:25.509
I'll get you some money, man.
Hey, look.

01:21:25.609 --> 01:21:29.346
Everybody saw you hanging around here
like you were casing the place.

01:21:29.446 --> 01:21:33.713
A million people must've seen you.
Will you listen to me?

01:21:35.076 --> 01:21:38.276
You want the whole neighbourhood
to know?

01:21:44.210 --> 01:21:45.862
What are you doing, man?

01:21:45.962 --> 01:21:49.324
What are you doing,
following me around like a lost puppy?

01:21:49.424 --> 01:21:51.535
What do you want outta me, anyway?

01:21:51.635 --> 01:21:54.246
What do you want? You want money?
I can get you some money.

01:21:54.346 --> 01:21:56.373
Let's just get outta here.

01:21:56.473 --> 01:22:00.606
I don't need any money, man.
What do you want? Tell me.

01:22:02.312 --> 01:22:04.339
I want you to see me
when you look at me.

01:22:04.439 --> 01:22:07.425
I want you to talk to me without you
dragging on about the Greeks and shit.

01:22:07.525 --> 01:22:10.303
You and the old man
think I'm dumb, right?

01:22:10.403 --> 01:22:13.139
You think I'm a dummy
cos I don't know the big words, right?

01:22:13.239 --> 01:22:16.839
Always leaving me out.
Well, I ain't that dumb.

01:22:17.285 --> 01:22:22.418
We could've run this whole side
of town, if you just gave me a chance.

01:22:22.832 --> 01:22:24.899
- Come on.
- No, no, no!

01:22:25.293 --> 01:22:29.026
If you just gave me a fucking chance!
Look at me!

01:22:30.465 --> 01:22:35.620
I just want you to see me, man.
I'm right here. I just want you to see me.

01:22:35.720 --> 01:22:37.853
I do see you, Rusty James.

01:22:42.894 --> 01:22:46.464
- Let's get outta here! Me and you...
- Me and you, we can't!

01:22:46.564 --> 01:22:49.831
Man, come on!
Come on! Don't do that, man!

01:22:57.867 --> 01:22:59.000
You know...

01:23:00.996 --> 01:23:04.524
I wish I were the big brother
you always wanted.

01:23:04.624 --> 01:23:08.357
But I can't be what I want
any more than you can.

01:23:09.546 --> 01:23:12.946
Listen.
I'm gonna put the fish in the river.

01:23:14.175 --> 01:23:16.369
After I do, I want you
to do something for me, OK?

01:23:16.469 --> 01:23:17.569
What?

01:23:18.972 --> 01:23:23.710
- This is important, so pay attention.
- OK, I'm paying attention.

01:23:23.810 --> 01:23:27.810
I want you to take the cycle
and I want you to leave.

01:23:30.150 --> 01:23:32.950
I want you to go clear to the ocean.

01:23:34.404 --> 01:23:37.804
I want you to follow
the river to the ocean.

01:23:39.576 --> 01:23:40.676
OK?

01:23:43.163 --> 01:23:45.096
Are you coming with me?

01:23:45.749 --> 01:23:46.849
No.

01:23:49.044 --> 01:23:51.044
Hey. Don't do that, man.

01:23:52.505 --> 01:23:53.905
Huh? Don't. No!

01:25:02.325 --> 01:25:03.425
No!

01:26:15.356 --> 01:26:17.289
OK, squirt, spread 'em!

01:26:30.496 --> 01:26:34.229
- OK, buddy. You're going downtown!
- Let him go!

01:26:35.877 --> 01:26:39.810
It's the guy's younger brother.
He's a little upset.

01:26:40.006 --> 01:26:42.539
I took care of the main problem.

01:26:48.056 --> 01:26:49.256
Rusty James!

01:26:58.608 --> 01:27:01.808
Get your fucking cameras
outta here, man!

01:27:04.447 --> 01:27:06.047
What's the matter?

01:27:06.824 --> 01:27:09.477
Get away from him!
Don't touch him!

01:27:09.577 --> 01:27:12.244
You didn't have to shoot him, man!

01:27:15.833 --> 01:27:19.279
- Who's that? Who's the guy?
- It's the Motorcycle Boy.

01:27:19.379 --> 01:27:20.779
He's been shot.

01:27:22.465 --> 01:27:25.465
- What's going on?
- The kid got shot.

01:27:25.635 --> 01:27:29.706
If they can get the Motorcycle Boy,
they can get anyone.

01:27:29.806 --> 01:27:33.539
You guys treat him nice.
He's the Motorcycle Boy.

01:27:36.354 --> 01:27:40.887
- What happened to the kid?
- They killed the Motorcycle Boy.

01:27:41.109 --> 01:27:44.976
- Was anybody else hurt?
- No, not in the vicinity.

01:27:46.072 --> 01:27:48.933
- I'm not allowed to say anything...
- But he knows him.

01:27:49.033 --> 01:27:52.812
I'm sorry. It doesn't matter.
We need it all cleared off.

01:27:52.912 --> 01:27:55.565
- Maybe Rusty James is hurt, Smokey.
- I had nothing to do with this.

01:27:55.665 --> 01:27:58.865
- It's really a shame.
- Where did he go?

01:27:59.043 --> 01:28:01.176
He had a future, that boy.

01:28:13.391 --> 01:28:14.658
It's too bad.

01:28:23.609 --> 01:28:25.142
The kid was shot.

01:28:25.820 --> 01:28:29.087
Nobody's gonna forget
that Motorcycle Boy.
