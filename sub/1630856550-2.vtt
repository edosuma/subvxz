00:02.263 --> 00:03.568
[tense music]

00:03.568 --> 00:05.788
- [John] You Bravo?
- Fog came in, comms went down.

00:05.788 --> 00:07.529
Interference from the relay.

00:07.529 --> 00:10.010
- [soldier screams]
- [gun fires]

00:10.010 --> 00:11.576
- [Elite roaring]
- [sword whooshing]

00:11.576 --> 00:13.839
The Covenant was already there,

00:13.839 --> 00:15.406
on Sanctuary
before they glassed it.

00:15.406 --> 00:17.669
- Perez.
- [energy whooshing]

00:17.669 --> 00:19.845
<i>If your plan is to glass a
planet, why invade it first?</i>

00:19.845 --> 00:21.325
- [explosion booms]
- [Kai] Who the hell is this guy?

00:21.325 --> 00:23.980
Mr. Ackerson is
Dr. Halsey's replacement.

00:23.980 --> 00:26.069
What do you think
they were after?

00:26.069 --> 00:29.029
I think they were training
for something bigger.

00:29.029 --> 00:30.987
He's got us escorting a tech
team on some fix-it mission.

00:30.987 --> 00:32.815
What's he got you fixing?

00:32.815 --> 00:34.034
Comms relay went down
in some nowhere system.

00:34.034 --> 00:36.210
[John]
So why send Cobalt team?

00:36.210 --> 00:38.473
Just tell 'em what they're
walking into. Tell Cobalt.

00:38.473 --> 00:40.779
John, I never approved
of Halsey's methods.

00:40.779 --> 00:42.477
- The Cortana system--
- No.

00:42.477 --> 00:43.956
- Was never intended--
- [John] You took her out.

00:43.956 --> 00:46.220
I cannot authorize Silver Team

00:46.220 --> 00:47.786
to perform combat operations.

00:47.786 --> 00:50.354
You should have stayed with me.

00:50.354 --> 00:52.226
[Minnie]
<i>In exchange for asylum,</i>

00:52.226 --> 00:55.838
these persons submit
to indentured service.

00:55.838 --> 00:57.927
I don't know how it happened,

00:57.927 --> 01:01.670
but the other families,
they're not afraid of you.

01:01.670 --> 01:04.020
- [people shouting]
- I have something you want!

01:04.020 --> 01:06.370
<i>A bounty,
for Catherine Halsey.</i>

01:06.370 --> 01:08.155
<i>I know where she is.</i>

01:08.155 --> 01:09.634
[Soren] Antares, what
the hell are you doing?

01:09.634 --> 01:13.377
[Felix] Soren-066?
You're under arrest.

01:13.377 --> 01:15.684
[Kwan] <i>The only thing
the monster wants</i>

01:15.684 --> 01:17.294
<i>is for you to know</i>

01:17.294 --> 01:19.514
<i>that there's nothing
you can ever love</i>

01:19.514 --> 01:21.820
<i>that it can't take away.</i>

01:21.820 --> 01:23.648
<i>You believe me now,
don't you?</i>

01:23.648 --> 01:25.346
[intense music]

01:30.351 --> 01:32.701
[serene music]

01:35.356 --> 01:39.316
[tea set clacking]

01:39.316 --> 01:40.883
Good afternoon.

01:43.320 --> 01:47.498
Two matcha tea cookies, two
macadamia nut, two shortbread--

01:47.498 --> 01:50.153
And a blue nectarine tea.

01:50.153 --> 01:51.241
It's my favorite.

01:53.809 --> 01:55.115
Isn't it beautiful?

01:56.377 --> 01:58.161
It's native only to Earth.

01:58.161 --> 01:59.510
In seven months,
the orange flowers

01:59.510 --> 02:01.164
are supposed to turn
into big red fruits,

02:01.164 --> 02:02.861
and then when you take a bite,

02:02.861 --> 02:04.733
the seeds just pop,
pop, pop in your mouth

02:04.733 --> 02:06.691
like little balloons
filled with juice.

02:07.823 --> 02:09.346
I also have this.

02:14.612 --> 02:17.572
I think it's some kind of game.

02:17.572 --> 02:20.009
Oh, you already have one.

02:20.009 --> 02:22.054
[Halsey] That's all right.

02:22.054 --> 02:24.796
- [Julia] Will you teach me?
- Yes.

02:24.796 --> 02:28.670
But first I'd like
you to do something for me.

02:28.670 --> 02:30.585
Of course.

02:30.585 --> 02:33.283
I want you to tell me what
happens when you leave here.

02:35.590 --> 02:37.069
Is that a problem?

02:37.069 --> 02:40.160
I... I don't know
if I'm allowed to say.

02:40.160 --> 02:42.162
[Halsey] Oh, I'm
sure it's all right.

02:44.425 --> 02:45.861
There's another room.

02:45.861 --> 02:49.256
- What kind of room?
- A big one.

02:49.256 --> 02:50.953
I dunno what you'd call it.

02:52.911 --> 02:54.391
What does this one do?

02:54.391 --> 02:57.351
That allows the players
to bet on the outcome.

02:57.351 --> 02:58.613
And then what happens?

03:00.005 --> 03:01.268
We roll to see goes first?

03:01.268 --> 03:04.271
No, what's beyond the room?

03:04.271 --> 03:07.056
Oh, um, there's a hallway.

03:07.056 --> 03:09.145
- Go on.
- There are many doors.

03:09.145 --> 03:10.277
What's behind the doors?

03:12.453 --> 03:13.454
I don't...

03:15.238 --> 03:16.848
I'm not supposed to look.

03:16.848 --> 03:18.937
Who told you not to look?

03:18.937 --> 03:21.288
[Julia] The man. I'll roll.

03:23.942 --> 03:24.682
Tell me about him.

03:26.075 --> 03:28.512
You'd like him, he's very nice.

03:28.512 --> 03:31.863
He's the one who's been
sending you all the gifts.

03:31.863 --> 03:34.214
[tense music]

03:38.522 --> 03:41.221
I need you to tell me
about the man.

03:41.221 --> 03:43.875
- My nose is bleeding.
- I know.

03:43.875 --> 03:45.834
Tell me what he looks like.

03:45.834 --> 03:47.705
I don't feel very good.

03:47.705 --> 03:48.880
[low]
Tell me his name.

03:48.880 --> 03:51.274
- I'm scared.
- I know.

03:51.274 --> 03:54.451
The man, his name.

03:54.451 --> 03:55.757
His name!

03:55.757 --> 03:57.846
Tell me his name.

03:57.846 --> 03:59.456
[head thuds]

03:59.456 --> 04:01.371
[serene music]

04:05.723 --> 04:07.377
[Halsey sighs]

04:10.598 --> 04:11.860
[indistinct chatter]

04:11.860 --> 04:14.384
[Riz groaning]

04:26.004 --> 04:28.093
- What are you doing?
- Training.

04:28.093 --> 04:31.183
You heard what Chief said.

04:31.183 --> 04:32.924
How much longer are
you gonna keep this up?

04:32.924 --> 04:35.405
They said I'm good to go.

04:35.405 --> 04:40.236
Well, you could talk to
Ackerson, take some time,

04:40.236 --> 04:42.891
- get a chance to--
- Time, for what?

04:42.891 --> 04:45.589
To heal.

04:45.589 --> 04:47.374
[Riz] I don't even
notice it most days.

04:49.376 --> 04:50.986
Well, we both know
that's not true.

04:50.986 --> 04:52.944
I'm a Spartan, Kai.

04:52.944 --> 04:54.076
We're at war.

04:57.427 --> 05:00.169
You can put your pellet back in.

05:00.169 --> 05:01.431
It will help with the pain.

05:04.304 --> 05:07.176
They'll have to put
a bullet in me first.

05:07.176 --> 05:08.308
[distant chatter]

05:15.227 --> 05:19.275
[indistinct radio chatter]

05:19.275 --> 05:21.538
[Kai] How long are you planning
on staring at that thing?

05:24.846 --> 05:27.152
Ackerson thinks there's
something wrong with me.

05:29.241 --> 05:31.200
I never thought I'd miss Halsey.

05:33.420 --> 05:34.508
It's like they don't trust us.

05:36.901 --> 05:38.033
Do you?

05:39.208 --> 05:40.949
Do I what?

05:40.949 --> 05:42.516
Think there's something wrong?

05:44.561 --> 05:47.564
It's only been
six months since...

05:47.564 --> 05:49.261
since they took Cortana
out of your head.

05:49.261 --> 05:51.481
- It's not that.
- Then what is it?

05:52.917 --> 05:55.180
I know you, John.

05:55.180 --> 05:56.617
- We're more than just--
- I saw her.

05:58.706 --> 06:00.360
[Kai] Who, you saw who?

06:05.495 --> 06:09.325
Makee, on Sanctuary.

06:09.325 --> 06:12.981
[emotional music]

06:12.981 --> 06:14.461
- Makee's dead.
- I know.

06:14.461 --> 06:16.637
- I shot her myself.
- I know that.

06:17.855 --> 06:19.509
Okay.

06:21.468 --> 06:24.427
[slides clacking]

06:29.650 --> 06:30.999
[John] What are you doing?

06:33.610 --> 06:35.612
- What?
-"Standby."

06:35.612 --> 06:37.571
Why did
you change that?

06:37.571 --> 06:39.442
Uh, well,
I think it means that--

06:39.442 --> 06:41.618
They're still out there.
They haven't come back yet.

06:41.618 --> 06:44.229
- You know that, right?
- Where's Cobalt?

06:44.229 --> 06:46.144
- Look, I'm just doing my job.
- [Vannak] What's going on?

06:46.144 --> 06:48.016
[Kai] Yeah, that's what
we're trying to figure out.

06:48.016 --> 06:50.366
What happened to Cobalt?

06:50.366 --> 06:52.324
I have no idea.
They tell me

06:52.324 --> 06:54.544
to change the board, so I,
I change the board.

06:54.544 --> 06:57.504
Who tells you to change it?
Keyes, Ackerson?

07:01.682 --> 07:02.857
Put that back.

07:02.857 --> 07:04.685
[tense music]

[tense music continues]

09:21.691 --> 09:23.388
Ah, come on.

09:25.173 --> 09:26.435
Ah!

09:36.271 --> 09:37.620
That doesn't belong to you.

09:40.231 --> 09:42.973
But you belong to me.

09:42.973 --> 09:44.627
You're indentured
to the Spiffs.

09:46.368 --> 09:47.891
I don't think so.

09:47.891 --> 09:52.200
Well, [scanner beeping]
your tag says otherwise.

09:53.418 --> 09:55.682
[ominous music]

[low]
You slippery bitch.

12:33.274 --> 12:36.930

Now I won't even make it quick.

I said stop.

13:22.845 --> 13:24.760
How bad is it?

13:24.760 --> 13:26.153
It's nothing.

13:26.153 --> 13:27.894
You assholes.

13:27.894 --> 13:29.547
At war your whole life,

13:29.547 --> 13:31.680
surprised when
you break down.

13:31.680 --> 13:34.204
- Let me help.
- Not here.

13:34.204 --> 13:36.816
[Louis] I could recommend that
they pull your ass off the line.

13:36.816 --> 13:38.948
And I could kill you.

13:38.948 --> 13:40.950
There she is.

13:40.950 --> 13:42.386
Relax, no one's looking.

- No.

13:53.267 --> 13:55.008

13:55.008 --> 13:57.140
- Be nice.

[Louis]
It's cool, I got you.

14:01.362 --> 14:02.842
[Riz] Thanks.

14:02.842 --> 14:05.235
You know you can't
do this forever.

14:05.235 --> 14:07.063
Spartans never die.

14:07.063 --> 14:08.804
I'm serious.

14:08.804 --> 14:10.458
There's other things to be,

14:10.458 --> 14:11.851
other ways to live.

14:11.851 --> 14:13.635
You ever think about that?

14:13.635 --> 14:15.942
[Riz] Think about what?

14:15.942 --> 14:18.379
Life without
all this Spartan shit.

14:18.379 --> 14:20.424
You mean a life
that doesn't matter?

14:20.424 --> 14:24.254
[Louis chuckles]

14:24.254 --> 14:25.865
Louis, I'm sorry, I didn't--

14:25.865 --> 14:27.214
- It's all right.
- I didn't mean...

14:27.214 --> 14:29.999
I know how you assholes think.

14:29.999 --> 14:31.435
I was you once.

14:31.435 --> 14:33.002
You were great.

14:33.002 --> 14:34.612
You were the best.

14:34.612 --> 14:36.484
Don't blow smoke up my ass.

14:38.573 --> 14:40.618
But it's true.

14:40.618 --> 14:43.012
[Riz] I wish you were
out there with us.

14:43.012 --> 14:44.884
[Louis] Yeah, I used
to wish that too.

14:47.147 --> 14:48.365
What changed?

14:48.365 --> 14:50.890
[somber music]

14:50.890 --> 14:52.717
You wouldn't understand.

14:56.460 --> 14:58.071
[John] Where's Cobalt?

14:59.507 --> 15:00.856
[Ackerson]
Do you want a drink?

15:00.856 --> 15:02.989
I don't drink.

15:02.989 --> 15:04.642
No, of course not.

15:04.642 --> 15:07.036
What about food?
Do you eat?

15:07.036 --> 15:08.646
What happened to Cobalt?

15:10.083 --> 15:11.780
Are they still alive?

15:11.780 --> 15:14.174
Well, as far as I know,
Spartans never die.

15:16.480 --> 15:19.570
Clear us for action, or
I'll find somebody who will.

15:19.570 --> 15:22.008
Are you threatening to
go over my head, John?

15:25.402 --> 15:28.666
You like a hierarchy,
I respect that.

15:28.666 --> 15:30.581
But make no mistake here, John.

15:30.581 --> 15:33.497
The ONI is running the show.

15:33.497 --> 15:36.761
And I am the ONI.

15:41.201 --> 15:45.205
You sure I can't get
you something, hm?

15:46.380 --> 15:49.600
Then allow me to be direct.

15:49.600 --> 15:53.387
Your account of events on
Sanctuary has proven dubious.

15:53.387 --> 15:54.954
[John] What?

15:54.954 --> 15:57.695
We were unable
to corroborate it.

15:57.695 --> 16:00.176
Well, talk to that corporal,
Perez, she was there.

16:00.176 --> 16:02.135
Yes, I did.
We spoke at length,

16:02.135 --> 16:05.355
but these things
that you insist happened,

16:05.355 --> 16:07.183
Covenant Elites
wiping out Marines?

16:07.183 --> 16:08.924
Those Marines are dead.

16:08.924 --> 16:10.534
What do you think
happened to them?

16:10.534 --> 16:13.276
I think the Covenant
glassed the planet.

16:13.276 --> 16:16.932
I think it was
a terrible tragedy.

16:16.932 --> 16:18.934
But the fact remains,
the corporal

16:18.934 --> 16:21.197
did not confirm your story.

16:21.197 --> 16:23.156
[chuckles]
What are you talking about?

16:23.156 --> 16:25.158
What does that mean?

16:25.158 --> 16:29.379
It means she has
absolutely no recollection

16:29.379 --> 16:30.946
of what you say you
encountered on Sanctuary.

16:30.946 --> 16:32.208
That's impossible.

16:34.210 --> 16:35.342
She's lying.

16:37.344 --> 16:40.216
[somber music]

16:42.001 --> 16:44.525
Put yourself in
my position, John.

16:46.440 --> 16:49.921
Given your recent behavior,
would you trust you?

16:52.446 --> 16:54.883
Can't win this war
without us, sir.

16:54.883 --> 16:56.885
You're right.

16:56.885 --> 17:00.193
I need Master Chief.
We all do.

17:01.933 --> 17:05.763
But John,
at the end of the day...

17:05.763 --> 17:08.244
he's just a guy in a suit.

17:12.292 --> 17:15.121
[door rattling]

17:19.734 --> 17:24.695
[Kessler]
I brought you food.

17:24.695 --> 17:26.219
[soft, pained grunt]

17:26.219 --> 17:27.350
What's wrong?

17:31.398 --> 17:35.010
- [machinery whirring]
- [chatter]

17:38.492 --> 17:42.148
Laera, what are you
doing down here?

17:42.148 --> 17:43.671
I told you I'd come get you
when the ship was ready.

17:43.671 --> 17:44.933
You said it would
be ready today.

17:44.933 --> 17:46.413
Yeah, I know what I said.

17:46.413 --> 17:49.503
Um... we found a problem.

17:49.503 --> 17:50.634
We found a crack in
the stream manifold.

17:50.634 --> 17:52.636
How long?

17:52.636 --> 17:54.073
[Castor] There's a lot of debris
around that cargo ship,

17:54.073 --> 17:55.639
took more hits than we realized.

17:55.639 --> 17:57.859
- How long?
- It's hard to say.

17:57.859 --> 17:59.382
A couple of days, maybe more.

18:01.123 --> 18:03.386
[tense music rises]

18:03.386 --> 18:06.085
We're doing
the best we can here.

18:06.085 --> 18:07.521
You should go upstairs
and get some rest.

18:07.521 --> 18:10.480
Soren never would've
left any of you behind.

18:10.480 --> 18:13.962
That cargo ship was
in a decaying orbit.

18:13.962 --> 18:17.966
We got hit, lost the gyro.
It was either detach or--

18:17.966 --> 18:19.359
You said that.

18:22.492 --> 18:24.494
- How's Kessler doing?
- [Laera] Kessler's fine.

18:26.540 --> 18:28.281
This sort of thing's
pretty hard on a kid.

18:28.281 --> 18:31.980
- Soren is not dead.
- No, of course not.

18:31.980 --> 18:33.808
He's alive,
do you understand me?

18:33.808 --> 18:35.505
Yes.

18:35.505 --> 18:38.595
Laera, we all
wanna find Soren.

18:38.595 --> 18:40.684
You know this isn't
the only ship on the Rubble.

18:40.684 --> 18:42.338
This is Soren's ship!

18:44.862 --> 18:46.212
Your captain.

18:49.824 --> 18:50.955
[Antares] Wait.

18:54.698 --> 18:56.352
[Kessler] <i>What
happened to your ear?</i>

18:58.093 --> 19:00.182
Did I do something wrong?

19:02.141 --> 19:03.707
Kwan?

19:03.707 --> 19:06.362
No, it's grown-up stuff.

19:08.059 --> 19:09.235
[Kessler]
I know grown-up stuff.

19:13.326 --> 19:15.502
- I have to go.
- Why?

19:15.502 --> 19:18.983
Because... I just do.

19:18.983 --> 19:21.290
[Kessler] Bad people
are looking for you?

19:21.290 --> 19:23.031
How do you--

19:23.031 --> 19:24.293
[Kessler] I told you
I know grown-up things.

19:27.078 --> 19:29.037
- You don't know anything.
- You're in danger.

19:29.037 --> 19:31.126
[Kwan] You, your mom--

19:31.126 --> 19:33.824
[Kessler] When my dad comes
back, he'll protect us.

19:33.824 --> 19:35.652
He's not coming back!

19:35.652 --> 19:38.873
[emotional music]

19:38.873 --> 19:40.440
[visor clacks]

19:42.137 --> 19:43.399
[Kwan sighs]
Kessler.

19:44.661 --> 19:46.968
[Kwan shouts,
object clatters]

19:46.968 --> 19:50.493
[Kwan panting]

19:50.493 --> 19:52.887
[Kwan sighs]

19:52.887 --> 19:55.019
[somber music]

19:57.979 --> 19:59.937
[running footsteps]

19:59.937 --> 20:03.767
- [tense music]
- [Riz grunting]

20:03.767 --> 20:05.682
[Riz panting]

20:05.682 --> 20:09.643
[Riz grunting]

20:09.643 --> 20:11.819
[Riz panting]

20:15.823 --> 20:17.738
[water rushing]

20:22.917 --> 20:25.311
[Riz panting]

20:27.791 --> 20:31.012
- [John] <i>Riz, I see you.</i>
- Shit!

20:31.012 --> 20:32.796
[John] Too slow.

20:32.796 --> 20:35.103
I have PID on target,
taking the shot.

20:35.103 --> 20:36.844
[Riz] Chief!
[groans]

20:36.844 --> 20:38.628
- [gun fires]
- [Riz shouting]

20:38.628 --> 20:41.065
[Riz groaning]

20:45.766 --> 20:48.203
[Vannak chuckles]

20:48.203 --> 20:49.465
[Vannak] Game over.

20:50.684 --> 20:53.382
Tell me, what is it like?

20:53.382 --> 20:56.690
- What?
- Losing, I wouldn't know.

20:56.690 --> 20:59.214
- You're insufferable.
- Because I've never lost.

20:59.214 --> 21:00.476
- Yeah, I get it.
- So for me,

21:00.476 --> 21:02.652
it'll be a new experience.

21:02.652 --> 21:04.872
- Chief, make him stop.
- We're going again.

21:04.872 --> 21:07.440
- Riz, you're up.
- Copy.

21:07.440 --> 21:09.659
- Well, I can go, Chief.
- I said Riz.

21:09.659 --> 21:10.965
- Chief!
- What?

21:13.054 --> 21:14.098
[Kai] Look at her.

21:14.098 --> 21:16.884
[John] Hey, you good?

21:16.884 --> 21:18.059
[Riz] Yes, Master Chief.

21:19.234 --> 21:21.802
[Riz grunts]

21:24.674 --> 21:26.197
Something you wanna say?

21:28.461 --> 21:31.942
[somber music]

21:31.942 --> 21:34.380
[ominous music]

21:36.556 --> 21:38.035
[Riz grunts]

21:43.998 --> 21:45.391
[Riz panting]

21:49.264 --> 21:52.006
- Come on.
- [gunshots]

21:53.573 --> 21:55.488
- [John] Vannak.
- [Vannak] I got her.

21:57.054 --> 21:58.665
[grunting]

21:58.665 --> 22:00.971
[panting]

22:00.971 --> 22:03.539
[panting continues]

22:03.539 --> 22:05.106
[soft cry]

22:07.543 --> 22:09.284
I have PID on target.

22:10.677 --> 22:14.420
Come on, come on.

22:14.420 --> 22:16.639
[Riz panting]

22:20.513 --> 22:22.819
[Riz grunts]

22:24.560 --> 22:27.476
[Riz grunting]

22:35.049 --> 22:37.225
[Riz grunting]

22:37.225 --> 22:39.880
[ominous music]

22:47.975 --> 22:50.456
[Vannak] Riz!

22:50.456 --> 22:52.196
Riz!

22:52.196 --> 22:55.112
[gasping and coughing]

23:01.510 --> 23:02.555
[Chief] Get up.

23:06.341 --> 23:08.474
- Don't you quit.
- Chief.

23:08.474 --> 23:10.780
- Get up!
- I can't.

23:10.780 --> 23:12.434
You've gotta stop pushing her,

23:12.434 --> 23:14.741
we've been out here
all night training, why?

23:14.741 --> 23:16.960
Because they're training!

23:16.960 --> 23:18.614
I told you what I
saw on Sanctuary.

23:18.614 --> 23:20.964
Our enemy is out there.

23:20.964 --> 23:23.532
They're getting close,
I can prove it.

23:23.532 --> 23:25.882
How are you gonna do that?

23:25.882 --> 23:27.536
I'm gonna find Cobalt.

23:29.364 --> 23:30.539
Run it again.

23:35.065 --> 23:38.329
[panting]

23:40.941 --> 23:43.117
[die clatter]

23:43.117 --> 23:47.861
[serene music]

23:47.861 --> 23:49.297
Again.

23:49.297 --> 23:51.299
The game's over.

23:51.299 --> 23:53.344
But we're playing to 50.

23:53.344 --> 23:55.346
I got over 50.

23:55.346 --> 23:57.653
I turned the doubling
cube each round,

23:57.653 --> 24:00.395
and you accepted every time.

24:00.395 --> 24:03.354
Sometimes taking a small loss

24:03.354 --> 24:05.966
is better than trying to win.

24:05.966 --> 24:07.358
I understand.

24:07.358 --> 24:09.839
Who's the man
who sent you here?

24:12.363 --> 24:13.713
How do you know about him?

24:13.713 --> 24:16.411
Well, these lovely gifts.

24:16.411 --> 24:17.717
Someone must be
giving them to you.

24:20.110 --> 24:21.938
It won't stop.

24:21.938 --> 24:23.418
[Halsey]
Tell me about the man.

24:24.593 --> 24:26.029
[stammers] He's...

24:26.029 --> 24:27.770
[Halsey] Yes,
you said he's nice.

24:27.770 --> 24:28.902
Yes, but describe him.

24:28.902 --> 24:30.338
What's happening to me?

24:30.338 --> 24:31.600
You're dying.

24:33.863 --> 24:35.952
What?
Did I do something wrong?

24:35.952 --> 24:37.388
Look at me, look at me.

24:39.390 --> 24:41.697
- I'm scared.
- I know.

24:41.697 --> 24:44.221
- [Julia] I'm very scared.
- Tell me his name.

24:44.221 --> 24:46.789
Tell me the man, his name.

24:46.789 --> 24:48.095
[heavy thud]

24:49.313 --> 24:51.228
[serene music continues]

24:54.623 --> 24:55.929
[calling out]
What's the point in this?

24:58.453 --> 25:00.455
[ominous music]

25:03.763 --> 25:06.156
[Louis] Riz, relax.
You're good.

25:06.156 --> 25:09.638
I shouldn't be here.

25:09.638 --> 25:11.248
He's the only guy
that can help you.

25:11.248 --> 25:12.859
How would you know that?

25:12.859 --> 25:13.816
'Cause he's
the one who saved me.

25:16.906 --> 25:18.560
Look, when we came
outta augmentation...

25:20.040 --> 25:21.128
I felt completely new.

25:23.652 --> 25:26.002
Even when people
started getting sick,

25:26.002 --> 25:28.091
I was invincible.

25:28.091 --> 25:30.659
After a couple of days,

25:30.659 --> 25:32.705
there was this darkness
at the edge of my vision.

25:34.489 --> 25:36.360
I just pretended
like it wasn't there.

25:38.449 --> 25:39.755
But it grew...

25:41.888 --> 25:42.715
and it grew.

25:44.891 --> 25:46.240
I never told anybody.

25:48.111 --> 25:49.852
You could have told me.

25:49.852 --> 25:52.768
- No, I couldn't.
- Why not?

25:52.768 --> 25:55.771
'Cause then you'd know
I wasn't one of you.

25:55.771 --> 25:58.687
I knew I only had a few days.

25:58.687 --> 25:59.862
I didn't wanna be
somebody going blind.

26:02.125 --> 26:03.649
I wanted to be a Spartan.

26:06.129 --> 26:07.740
Even if just for a little while.

26:11.047 --> 26:13.615
You know, the last day I
could really see anything...

26:15.138 --> 26:16.531
I remember looking
at all of you...

26:18.489 --> 26:19.839
how proud you were...

26:22.319 --> 26:23.669
how beautiful.

26:30.284 --> 26:31.894
Then it all went dark.

26:35.115 --> 26:36.203
[Danilo] Be well.

26:37.987 --> 26:39.075
Who's this?

26:39.075 --> 26:42.252
She's a friend.

26:42.252 --> 26:43.514
[Danilo] Hello, friend.

26:47.867 --> 26:50.957
[Ackerson] <i>I am a bit
worried about John.</i>

26:50.957 --> 26:54.482
<i>Not Master Chief,
but John the man.</i>

26:54.482 --> 26:57.485
And I know how long
you've been together.

26:57.485 --> 26:59.269
I know you care about him.

In fact, I venture to say

27:02.969 --> 27:05.885
you probably know him
better than anyone.

27:05.885 --> 27:09.149
- Do you agree?
- Well, I--

27:09.149 --> 27:11.455
[Ackerson] I thought
perhaps you might help me

27:11.455 --> 27:14.284
to help him.

27:14.284 --> 27:16.678
Is that something
you could do?

27:18.680 --> 27:19.768
Of course.

[Ackerson] <i>Have you
witnessed any behavior</i>

be a threat to his team...</i>

27:28.777 --> 27:31.301

27:36.480 --> 27:38.395
No, sir.

27:40.528 --> 27:42.138
That's a relief.

27:48.231 --> 27:51.887
I just think it's a lot, sir.

seeing everything he's seen.</i>

27:55.761 --> 27:58.067

28:02.245 --> 28:03.856
I just wonder sometimes...

28:06.902 --> 28:08.991
if he can let
the past become the past.

28:11.037 --> 28:14.083
Do you have concerns
about John's mental state?

28:19.262 --> 28:23.484
No. Absolutely not, sir.

28:23.484 --> 28:27.270
The chief is solid.
He's the best we've got.

28:27.270 --> 28:32.232
Well, I certainly understand
what he sees in you.

28:33.363 --> 28:35.235
Thank you, sir.

28:35.235 --> 28:37.846
I only hope he
values your loyalty.

Yes, dismissed.

Ackerson what you saw?

And yet here you are.

35:19.987 --> 35:22.120
Well, we both knew
I'd be here someday.

35:26.820 --> 35:29.214
There was a pomegranate tree
in my father's garden

35:29.214 --> 35:30.389
in Port Vernon.

35:32.347 --> 35:35.568
He spent years cultivating it,

35:35.568 --> 35:39.311
even though they're
not native to Endymion.

35:39.311 --> 35:42.314
And he used to wake me up
a couple of hours

35:42.314 --> 35:46.231
before sunrise every day
to till the garden.

35:46.231 --> 35:49.364
I resented him for this, I
thought the work was beneath me.

35:49.364 --> 35:55.022
And I remember one evening
there was a lightning storm,

35:55.022 --> 36:00.419
and I snuck out of my room,
and I set his tree on fire.

36:00.419 --> 36:02.551
He never suspected
I had anything to do with it.

36:05.380 --> 36:09.079

anyone that story...

There's only one person
who could know about it.

is pure coincidence.

So, have you made any progress
with the problem I gave you?

38:32.571 --> 38:35.965
<i>Yes, but it's

38:35.965 --> 38:38.054
<i>I could provide you with

38:40.318 --> 38:41.754
Well, I'm afraid
I can't do that.

38:41.754 --> 38:43.364
<i>Oh.</i>

it your best shot,

even with a margin for error,

38:45.714 --> 38:48.195

you've been given,

39:00.338 --> 39:02.557
are there any viable
strategies you would recommend

39:02.557 --> 39:04.864
