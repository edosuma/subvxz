WEBVTT

00:08.834 --> 00:09.879
My God.

00:09.922 --> 00:11.074
I can't even
with Heather anymore.

00:11.098 --> 00:12.882
I know, right? She's so thirsty.

00:12.925 --> 00:14.753
I mean, look at this picture
she just posted.

00:14.797 --> 00:16.755
NoFilter, my ass.

00:16.799 --> 00:18.559
Where the hell are all your pores?
Yeah, I bet she walks around

00:18.583 --> 00:21.195
in chromogenic lighting
all day, too.

00:21.238 --> 00:23.240
Can I use your phone
to check my notifs?

00:23.284 --> 00:24.348
You need to get your own phone.

00:24.372 --> 00:27.462
I have my own phone. See?

00:27.505 --> 00:29.855
Yeah, tell that to my...

00:29.899 --> 00:31.988
parents.

00:32.031 --> 00:33.033
Hello?

00:33.076 --> 00:34.034
Hey, sweetie.

00:34.077 --> 00:35.426
Can you stop by the pharmacy

00:35.470 --> 00:37.100
and pick up some Bingeman
daytime cough medicine?

00:37.124 --> 00:38.386
We're out.

00:38.429 --> 00:40.301
What? No. Ang and I
are hanging out.

00:40.344 --> 00:42.303
You said we could.
This was planned.

00:42.346 --> 00:43.304
I know, sweetie,

00:43.347 --> 00:45.654
but Nolan woke up sick.

00:45.697 --> 00:47.873
I have work to do and...

00:47.917 --> 00:51.225
Nolan won't let
Dad leave him alone.

00:51.268 --> 00:52.530
Hey, don't tell her that.

00:52.574 --> 00:55.142
Yeah. Okay, sure.

00:57.144 --> 00:59.276
I'll see you tomorrow, I guess.

00:59.320 --> 01:00.625
Yeah.

01:02.000 --> 01:08.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:26.434 --> 01:28.436
Home.

01:40.926 --> 01:42.841
Mom?

01:42.885 --> 01:44.452
Dad?

01:44.495 --> 01:46.454
Mom!

01:46.497 --> 01:48.456
Dad!

01:48.499 --> 01:51.023
Nolan?

02:03.253 --> 02:05.081
Come on.

02:05.125 --> 02:07.127
Come on, Aunt Sylvia, come on.

02:13.698 --> 02:15.396
You've reached Sylvia.

02:15.439 --> 02:16.439
Please leave a message.

02:56.654 --> 02:59.962
Crisis Resolution.

03:00.005 --> 03:03.183
I need your help.

03:28.295 --> 03:29.533
I just want to make sure
I understand.

03:29.557 --> 03:31.056
Your parents said
not to call the police?

03:31.080 --> 03:33.300
No. They said never call them.

03:33.343 --> 03:36.216
Doesn't sound like
strong parental advice.

03:36.259 --> 03:37.434
Yeah? You got kids?

03:39.088 --> 03:42.309
My parents aren't big
on-on the Man.

03:42.352 --> 03:45.747
You know? My-my dad said
that he's always watching us

03:45.790 --> 03:49.011
and that extends
to the cops, too.

03:49.054 --> 03:51.187
Said something bad could happen
if we called them.

03:51.231 --> 03:52.511
Being scared
that "something bad"

03:52.536 --> 03:54.103
will happen
if you call the police,

03:54.146 --> 03:55.887
you don't find that strange?

03:55.931 --> 03:58.412
Look, my-my parents
are just overprotective.

03:58.455 --> 04:02.851
And they said that
if anything bad ever happened,

04:02.894 --> 04:07.029
just forget about the cops and
grab this bag, call Aunt Sylvia

04:07.072 --> 04:09.161
and do whatever
she told us to do.

04:09.205 --> 04:10.445
But Aunt Sylvia never answered?

04:11.425 --> 04:12.817
Do you know
your Aunt Sylvia well?

04:12.861 --> 04:13.992
I met her once

04:14.036 --> 04:15.516
when I was, like, five, maybe.

04:15.559 --> 04:17.474
I can't find any signs

04:17.517 --> 04:20.564
of forced entry, but there was
definitely a struggle here.

04:20.608 --> 04:22.436
The parents and brother
didn't go willingly.

04:22.479 --> 04:24.438
A ton of Web blockers on this.

04:24.481 --> 04:25.830
Really?

04:25.874 --> 04:27.417
Yeah, they obviously
didn't want their kids

04:27.441 --> 04:28.833
looking at the wrong stuff.

04:28.877 --> 04:31.706
I'm sure the teenage
daughter loves that.

04:33.882 --> 04:37.494
And this $30,000 is
all that was in the bag?

04:39.801 --> 04:41.368
Are you sure about that?

04:41.411 --> 04:43.979
You sure about that scarf?

04:49.463 --> 04:51.291
Nolan?

04:53.597 --> 04:55.382
Nolan?

04:55.425 --> 04:57.514
Thank God. What happened?

04:59.603 --> 05:02.693
Come on, buddy. Say something.

05:02.737 --> 05:04.478
Nolan, why won't
you say anything?

05:15.271 --> 05:17.665
You guys feel like a drink?

05:17.708 --> 05:19.319
Coffee, perhaps?

05:19.362 --> 05:21.930
Stop!

05:21.973 --> 05:23.801
We told you where to find it.

05:23.845 --> 05:26.674
Boss. It's where
they said it was.

05:26.717 --> 05:28.328
In a boathouse, half hour east.

05:28.371 --> 05:30.982
Is it all there?

05:31.026 --> 05:32.636
What's this?

05:32.680 --> 05:34.725
50 grand.

05:34.769 --> 05:36.684
Where's the rest?

05:36.727 --> 05:39.600
It's been ten years. It's gone.

05:41.950 --> 05:43.647
No! No!

05:46.911 --> 05:49.523
You can torture us all you want.

05:49.566 --> 05:51.612
We can't give you
what we don't have.

05:53.048 --> 05:56.573
I'm not gonna
torture you, honey.

05:56.617 --> 05:58.488
You'll never find our kids.

05:58.532 --> 06:02.231
Aunt Sylvia's
not in any position

06:02.274 --> 06:03.798
to look after them now.

06:07.628 --> 06:09.630
Nolan, the people who were here,

06:09.673 --> 06:11.458
did you see them?

06:14.635 --> 06:16.158
I don't know
what's wrong with him.

06:16.201 --> 06:17.289
Usually he won't shut up.

06:17.333 --> 06:19.248
Come on, buddy.

06:19.291 --> 06:22.338
You have to say something.
He can't. He's in shock.

06:22.382 --> 06:23.750
Going through what's called
reactive mutism.

06:23.774 --> 06:25.317
It's what happens
when someone witnesses

06:25.341 --> 06:28.605
or experiences something...

06:28.649 --> 06:29.432
Witnesses or experiences
something what?

06:29.476 --> 06:31.739
Bad? Traumatic?

06:31.782 --> 06:33.610
There's blood on the blankets.

06:33.654 --> 06:36.134
My brother was hiding
and my-my parents are missing.

06:36.178 --> 06:38.591
I don't think there's a point
in censoring yourselves anymore.

06:38.615 --> 06:39.529
We've tried your Aunt Sylvia

06:39.573 --> 06:41.313
several times.

06:41.357 --> 06:42.402
There's still no answer.

06:42.445 --> 06:44.708
Eric, we should
just call the police.

06:44.752 --> 06:46.493
No.

06:46.536 --> 06:47.731
No cops. Sweetie, our job isn't

06:47.755 --> 06:49.887
to find people;
It's to get them back.

06:49.931 --> 06:51.889
- Then get them back.
- Nolan,

06:51.933 --> 06:53.737
why don't you go show Zara
and Cynthia your room?

06:53.761 --> 06:55.695
Sure they'd be interested
to take a quick look around.

06:55.719 --> 06:56.938
And Taylor, um,

06:56.981 --> 06:58.940
let's go make you guys a snack.

06:58.983 --> 07:01.638
I'm sure you're starving.

07:01.682 --> 07:04.641
I bet you're a PB & J
type of guy?

07:11.082 --> 07:12.780
Come on. Lead the way.

07:12.823 --> 07:14.695
What are,
what are your folks like?

07:14.738 --> 07:16.740
I don't know.

07:16.784 --> 07:18.829
Fine, I guess.

07:18.873 --> 07:21.310
I mean, I love them,
but they're boring.

07:21.353 --> 07:22.809
You know, they never
let us do anything.

07:22.833 --> 07:24.400
Always have to be
home after school.

07:24.444 --> 07:27.664
No extracurricular activities,
no social media.

07:27.708 --> 07:29.100
They're just...

07:29.144 --> 07:30.624
Oppressive?

07:30.667 --> 07:35.455
Well, they're not North Korea,
but yeah, I guess.

07:35.498 --> 07:36.780
Is there something you're
not telling us, Taylor?

07:36.804 --> 07:38.022
You seem a little tense.

07:40.503 --> 07:43.419
Dude, my parents are missing.

07:43.463 --> 07:45.421
I'm sorry if I'm not chill,

07:45.465 --> 07:46.640
but I hired you, remember?

07:46.683 --> 07:48.250
Why would I hide
anything from you?

07:48.293 --> 07:50.600
I don't know, dude,
but I'm a profiler.

07:50.644 --> 07:53.211
It's my job... the one
that you hired me to do,

07:53.255 --> 07:55.562
as you so kindly pointed out...

07:55.605 --> 07:57.085
And your micro-expressions
tell me

07:57.128 --> 08:00.088
that you're
holding something back.

08:01.916 --> 08:03.308
We really need to implement

08:03.352 --> 08:06.311
a minimum age requirement
for clients.

08:06.355 --> 08:08.618
This was also in the bag.

08:08.662 --> 08:11.534
It's from my last birthday.

08:11.578 --> 08:13.275
Where was this taken?

08:13.318 --> 08:15.886
Our favorite ice cream shop.

08:15.930 --> 08:17.409
Turn it over.

08:17.453 --> 08:20.195
"Get Nolan his
favorite ice cream,

08:20.238 --> 08:21.588
"tell Aunt Sylvia,

08:21.631 --> 08:23.415
remember your locket
and watch your back."

08:23.459 --> 08:25.287
This is so confusing.
What does it mean?

08:25.330 --> 08:26.549
Is it a riddle? Could be.

08:26.593 --> 08:28.116
My parents are nerds.

08:28.159 --> 08:30.292
They love games, puzzles,
brain teasers.

08:30.335 --> 08:33.730
They say that they prepare
you for real-life problems.

08:36.907 --> 08:38.779
What are you doing here, skiing?

08:38.822 --> 08:41.999
Wow. Okay.

08:42.043 --> 08:45.525
Is that your sister?

08:45.568 --> 08:47.372
Instructing the kids
never to talk to the police,

08:47.396 --> 08:48.852
leaving them with a bag
filled with money

08:48.876 --> 08:51.008
suggests that they...

08:51.052 --> 08:52.899
The parents were expecting
this to happen one day.

08:52.923 --> 08:55.230
And made a plan for when it did.

08:56.623 --> 08:58.625
I got it, I got it. No, no, no.

08:58.668 --> 08:59.863
Taylor, wait, wait,
wait a second.

08:59.887 --> 09:01.932
Put it on speaker,
watch me for cues

09:01.976 --> 09:03.586
and say as little as possible.

09:03.630 --> 09:04.805
Okay?

09:09.113 --> 09:10.811
Hello?

09:10.854 --> 09:12.900
Taylor, dear, it's Sylvia.

09:12.943 --> 09:13.964
Aunt Sylvia, thank God.
I couldn't...

09:13.988 --> 09:16.120
Are you and your brother okay?

09:16.164 --> 09:19.733
Yeah, we're fine. Scared, but...

09:19.776 --> 09:21.996
Are you and your brother
at home?

09:27.871 --> 09:31.179
Um, yeah.

09:31.222 --> 09:33.311
But where are Mom and Dad?
What-what do we do?

09:33.355 --> 09:35.487
Nothing, sweetie.
You just sit tight

09:35.531 --> 09:37.315
and I'll send a car
to pick you up.

09:37.359 --> 09:38.534
Anybody else there?

09:39.840 --> 09:40.667
No.

09:40.710 --> 09:43.147
No, it's just us. Good.

09:43.191 --> 09:46.498
Now, don't worry.
Everything's fine.

09:46.542 --> 09:47.848
See you soon, dear.

09:54.985 --> 09:57.379
That wasn't.

09:57.422 --> 09:59.816
Aunt Sylvia. I used
software on my laptop

09:59.860 --> 10:02.142
to trace the call; You said your
Aunt Sylvia's from New York,

10:02.166 --> 10:03.777
but that call came from

10:03.820 --> 10:05.256
a Boston area cell phone.

10:05.300 --> 10:06.823
And the measured way
which she spoke

10:06.867 --> 10:08.564
didn't indicate
sincerity at all.

10:08.608 --> 10:11.741
She was sussing out
the situation.

10:11.785 --> 10:12.936
So, whoever it was,
they're on their way

10:12.960 --> 10:13.917
over here, looking for you two.

10:13.961 --> 10:15.919
Yeah. Yeah,
that's what it seems like.

10:15.963 --> 10:17.854
Whoever abducted your parents
wants something from them.

10:17.878 --> 10:20.358
Perhaps your mom and dad aren't
willing to give it to them,

10:20.402 --> 10:21.640
and they think
that threatening you

10:21.664 --> 10:23.318
is going to change their minds.

10:23.361 --> 10:25.102
What do they want
from my parents?

10:25.146 --> 10:26.930
The 30 grand?
Advice on beige pants?

10:26.974 --> 10:29.716
Well, we...
we don't know that yet.

10:29.759 --> 10:31.674
Whatever it is,
I'm guessing it's related

10:31.718 --> 10:33.173
to the message
on the back of this photo,

10:33.197 --> 10:34.590
which means it's something

10:34.634 --> 10:36.810
other than the money
in the garage.

10:36.853 --> 10:38.091
You guys are gonna
crack the code

10:38.115 --> 10:40.248
in order to help us find it.

10:40.291 --> 10:41.529
We'll start
with the ice cream shop.

10:41.553 --> 10:42.835
And make sure
to pack a few things.

10:42.859 --> 10:44.774
There's no telling
how long we'll be.

11:01.661 --> 11:03.053
Taylor.

11:03.097 --> 11:05.142
Coming!

11:09.277 --> 11:10.452
You ready?

11:10.495 --> 11:12.410
Yep.

11:12.454 --> 11:14.630
Hey, you okay?

11:21.463 --> 11:23.857
Okay, Nolan, what'll it be?

11:23.900 --> 11:26.860
His favorite is strawberry
mint with sprinkles,

11:26.903 --> 11:28.209
and waffle cone, right?

11:28.252 --> 11:30.994
Sounds good, I guess.

11:31.038 --> 11:32.430
Taylor, what are you gonna have?

11:32.474 --> 11:35.956
Man, I can't eat right now.

11:38.045 --> 11:41.004
Hi, I'd like a strawberry mint
ice cream with sprinkles

11:41.048 --> 11:43.528
in a waffle cone, s'il vous plaît.

11:50.927 --> 11:52.537
Your parents
wanted to make sure,

11:52.581 --> 11:53.756
no matter what happened,

11:53.800 --> 11:55.323
you'd be safe.

11:55.366 --> 11:56.846
I guess they were wrong.

11:56.890 --> 11:59.675
Hey. You're still safe.

12:05.333 --> 12:06.813
What is it?

12:07.944 --> 12:10.599
"Get Nolan his favorite
ice cream,

12:10.642 --> 12:12.055
"tell Aunt Sylvia,
remember your locket

12:12.079 --> 12:13.167
and watch your back."

12:13.210 --> 12:16.736
"Lock et clé"means "lock
and key," but look.

12:16.779 --> 12:18.868
Leave out the "clé,"
and it says "locket."

12:22.872 --> 12:25.570
The manager said unit 1051.

12:25.614 --> 12:26.833
It's right over here.

12:28.182 --> 12:30.619
Fifty one.

12:30.662 --> 12:32.099
Any ideas?

12:32.142 --> 12:35.015
No, the answer's
got to be in this photo.

12:36.930 --> 12:39.671
"Remember your locket
and watch your back."

12:39.715 --> 12:42.500
"Watch your..."

12:42.544 --> 12:44.241
You see how prominently
your watch

12:44.285 --> 12:45.503
is displayed in this photo?

12:45.547 --> 12:47.331
It's almost like it was staged.

12:47.375 --> 12:48.637
It wasn't.

12:48.680 --> 12:50.944
Well, as far as you knew.

12:55.122 --> 12:56.688
It's my birthday.

12:56.732 --> 12:59.169
11-23-4. It's our way in.

13:03.565 --> 13:05.001
A hockey bag.

13:05.045 --> 13:07.003
Have you guys seen this before?

13:07.047 --> 13:08.352
No.

13:21.017 --> 13:22.845
Okay, this doesn't
make any sense.

13:22.889 --> 13:25.369
What's that? I've run
background on the Thomases,

13:25.413 --> 13:27.545
and I still can't find
any record of them

13:27.589 --> 13:29.896
going back further
than 11 or 12 years.

13:29.939 --> 13:33.116
No passports,
employment histories,

13:33.160 --> 13:34.770
driver's licenses.

13:34.814 --> 13:36.076
Nothing from Hartford?

13:36.119 --> 13:37.120
No, it's like...

13:37.164 --> 13:38.818
They never existed.

13:40.080 --> 13:41.951
Heads up.

13:45.607 --> 13:46.956
Here we go.

13:47.000 --> 13:48.915
Blue van.

13:54.181 --> 13:57.053
Doesn't look like someone
who's calling the shots.

13:57.097 --> 13:58.315
No.

13:58.359 --> 14:00.709
Most likely working
for whoever is.

14:05.322 --> 14:06.758
Careful.

14:16.377 --> 14:18.640
Oliver, what'd you find?

14:18.683 --> 14:21.164
Just two and a half mill
stashed in a storage locker.

14:21.208 --> 14:22.687
Interesting. You?

14:22.731 --> 14:24.994
A date with someone
who's looking for it.

14:25.038 --> 14:27.779
Probably isn't gonna be
very happy to see me.

14:36.049 --> 14:37.267
Hello?

14:37.311 --> 14:39.704
Who is this? Who's this?

14:39.748 --> 14:42.011
I'm guessing
it isn't "Aunt Sylvia".

14:42.055 --> 14:43.404
Sylvia's taken some time off.

14:43.447 --> 14:44.796
Who are you?

14:44.840 --> 14:46.059
My name is Zara Hallam.

14:46.102 --> 14:47.408
And you are?

14:47.451 --> 14:48.811
Why did you call
this number today?

14:48.844 --> 14:49.844
Who am I speaking with?

15:07.645 --> 15:09.038
Eric.

15:09.082 --> 15:10.997
I just got a call
from Aunt Sylvia's phone.

15:11.040 --> 15:12.868
I know a cop when I hear one.

15:12.912 --> 15:16.219
The Thomases aren't victims
of a home invasion.

15:16.263 --> 15:18.439
They're in the Witness
Protection Program.

15:20.267 --> 15:22.225
Eric?

15:22.269 --> 15:24.271
Eric?

15:44.073 --> 15:45.509
Who are you?

15:45.553 --> 15:47.139
My name is Eric Beaumont,
I'm a private negotiator.

15:47.163 --> 15:50.123
What I'd like to know
is who are you?

15:50.166 --> 15:52.038
Doesn't matter who I am, bro.

15:54.344 --> 15:55.824
Where are the kids?

15:55.867 --> 15:58.740
They're safe.

15:58.783 --> 16:01.395
Where's the money?
If you're willing to prove to me

16:01.438 --> 16:03.266
that Lucas and Anita Thomas
are safe,

16:03.310 --> 16:05.181
I will give it to you.

16:05.225 --> 16:06.269
We don't make deals.

16:06.313 --> 16:08.358
Maybe your boss does.

16:08.402 --> 16:11.013
If you kill me, she will
never get what she wants.

16:11.057 --> 16:13.189
That's gonna fall on you,
and I'm guessing

16:13.233 --> 16:16.149
she's not the type of person
that you want to let down.

16:34.863 --> 16:36.691
Got it.

16:39.128 --> 16:41.870
Our guys say the FBI found
the dead marshal's body.

16:41.913 --> 16:44.873
We're tracking their movements.

16:49.617 --> 16:50.966
This is gonna sound dumb,

16:51.010 --> 16:52.248
but you shouldn't
be near the window.

16:52.272 --> 16:53.316
Witness Protection?

16:53.360 --> 16:56.102
My parents?

16:56.145 --> 16:57.383
Who are they?
Well, we don't know

16:57.407 --> 16:59.322
who did this yet, but...

16:59.366 --> 17:00.845
No, who are my parents?

17:00.889 --> 17:02.891
Are they bad people?
And w-why didn't

17:02.934 --> 17:04.694
they tell us this, because they
thought thiswas a better plan?

17:04.719 --> 17:06.112
Listen, I know

17:06.155 --> 17:07.852
you think adults
don't get teenagers,

17:07.896 --> 17:09.680
and that may be especially true

17:09.723 --> 17:11.093
in the case of your
parents, but you really

17:11.117 --> 17:13.205
didn't get them, either.

17:13.249 --> 17:15.358
You thought they were boring
and oppressive, when really,

17:15.382 --> 17:17.079
all they were trying to do
was protect you.

17:17.123 --> 17:20.343
Tell me what's going on.

17:20.387 --> 17:22.084
It may help us
find your parents.

17:23.738 --> 17:26.132
Um...

17:26.175 --> 17:29.396
my-my mom and dad
don't let Nolan or I use

17:29.439 --> 17:31.093
smartphones or social media.

17:32.399 --> 17:35.837
But I used
my friend's phone to, um,

17:35.880 --> 17:37.665
set up an account.

17:37.708 --> 17:39.686
I just wanted to do what every
kid was doing, you know?

17:39.710 --> 17:41.625
Hashtag I get it.

17:41.669 --> 17:43.192
You're a dork.

17:43.236 --> 17:45.847
I... scrolling through, and I saw

17:45.890 --> 17:49.155
a photo of a four-year-old girl
I somehow recognized.

17:49.198 --> 17:51.635
The caption read,
"Looking for my friend, Taylor,

17:51.679 --> 17:53.159
"from kindergarten.

17:53.202 --> 17:55.248
Share and help me find her."

17:55.291 --> 17:58.033
I kept staring at this photo

17:58.077 --> 18:01.863
until it dawned on me
why I recognized her.

18:01.906 --> 18:03.343
She was me.

18:03.386 --> 18:04.996
You didn't know that right away?

18:05.040 --> 18:06.259
No.

18:06.302 --> 18:08.435
I've never seen a picture of me
that young before.

18:08.478 --> 18:09.697
They all burned.

18:09.740 --> 18:12.134
Yeah, but, um,

18:12.178 --> 18:13.962
I messaged the girl
who posted the photo.

18:14.005 --> 18:15.285
You told her
where you lived now.

18:17.357 --> 18:19.359
Is that how they found us?

18:19.402 --> 18:22.188
I don't know that, but this
isn't your fault, Taylor.

18:22.231 --> 18:24.190
You didn't know.
Yeah, you're right.

18:24.233 --> 18:26.192
I didn't know.
I didn't know anything,

18:26.235 --> 18:28.716
and I still don't know anything.

18:28.759 --> 18:30.109
Hey, guys.

18:30.152 --> 18:31.893
Hey.

18:31.936 --> 18:34.896
I managed to convince someone
to draw a picture for you.

18:34.939 --> 18:36.419
Well, hand it over.

18:36.463 --> 18:38.465
'Cause I do...

18:38.508 --> 18:41.120
love art.

18:41.163 --> 18:43.731
Hey, you're like
a regular Michelangelo.

18:46.473 --> 18:48.736
Nolan, what is
this woman saying?

20:13.342 --> 20:15.301
My name is Eric Beaumont.

20:18.782 --> 20:20.480
I'm a private negotiator

20:20.523 --> 20:22.960
working for Taylor
and Nolan Thomas.

20:23.004 --> 20:24.962
I understand you have
their parents.

20:25.006 --> 20:26.137
Frances.

20:26.181 --> 20:28.357
The Thomases have my money.

20:28.401 --> 20:30.968
The Thomases did
have your money.

20:31.012 --> 20:33.362
Now my team has.
Unlike the Thomases,

20:33.406 --> 20:35.234
however, I'm willing
to give it to you.

20:35.277 --> 20:37.323
That's smart of you.
Before I do, though,

20:37.366 --> 20:39.281
I need to know that Lucas
and Anita are alive.

20:39.325 --> 20:42.284
Knock yourself out.
They're in the back.

20:42.328 --> 20:45.374
I ran her through NCIC.

20:45.418 --> 20:48.899
Frances Sullivan, owner of
Sullivan Construction Company.

20:48.943 --> 20:51.641
The business is a front for
the Sullivan crime organization

20:51.685 --> 20:53.295
of South Boston.

20:53.339 --> 20:55.428
Please, get us out of here.

20:55.471 --> 20:59.301
Police say Frances has
put more bodies in the ground

20:59.345 --> 21:00.694
than her husband.

21:00.737 --> 21:02.348
Big fan of death by car bomb.

21:02.391 --> 21:04.480
And she just finished
a ten-year stint

21:04.524 --> 21:06.308
after someone turned her in
for tax evasion.

21:06.352 --> 21:08.832
Okay, so, how do you
want to do this?

21:08.876 --> 21:12.488
Simple. You give me
five million, I give you them.

21:12.532 --> 21:14.379
The Thomases took five million from you?
And if you knew me,

21:14.403 --> 21:17.537
you'd know what a poor
decision that was.

21:17.580 --> 21:19.515
U.S. Marshals don't put
people into Witness Protection

21:19.539 --> 21:21.715
for stealing from crime bosses.

21:21.758 --> 21:24.544
Lucas and Anita are the ones who
put you in jail, aren't they?

21:24.587 --> 21:27.024
My accountants.

21:27.068 --> 21:30.463
They were fine helping me
to evade the taxes,

21:30.506 --> 21:34.249
but then suddenly,
they decided they wanted out.

21:34.293 --> 21:36.382
And to get out,
they turned you in

21:36.425 --> 21:39.820
and grabbed some of your cash
to start their lives over?

21:39.863 --> 21:41.691
Well, now I'm back,
and I want my money.

21:41.735 --> 21:43.127
And I'm gonna give it to you.

21:43.171 --> 21:45.782
But only two and a half million.

21:45.826 --> 21:46.826
That's all that's left.

21:52.049 --> 21:54.225
People don't seem to understand,

21:54.269 --> 21:55.575
I didn't get this far

21:55.618 --> 21:58.621
by rolling out and not
getting what I wanted.

21:58.665 --> 22:02.495
They stole five million from me,
and I want five million back!

22:06.150 --> 22:07.891
It's impossible
to give you something

22:07.935 --> 22:10.111
that no longer exists.
Then I'll kill 'em.

22:10.154 --> 22:12.635
And their children and you.

22:12.679 --> 22:15.116
You just spent
a decade in prison.

22:15.159 --> 22:17.597
Is it worth going back
for murders over money

22:17.640 --> 22:18.902
that's no longer there?

22:18.946 --> 22:21.688
Cops never know how
to find the bodies I bury.

22:21.731 --> 22:23.603
But they will find you.

22:25.692 --> 22:27.650
You think I came here alone?

22:27.694 --> 22:28.869
Look, you want to add

22:28.912 --> 22:32.307
a body to your list of murders,
or do you want your money?

22:43.362 --> 22:46.713
4:00...
under St. Martin's Bridge.

22:46.756 --> 22:49.455
Two and a half million,
and not a penny less.

22:49.498 --> 22:53.067
Deal. I'll bring the money

22:53.110 --> 22:54.218
to the rendezvous point myself.

22:54.242 --> 22:55.983
No.

22:56.026 --> 22:58.768
Let your team bring the money.

22:58.812 --> 23:01.292
When I have it, you can go.

23:03.382 --> 23:06.472
And whoever you got outside,

23:06.515 --> 23:08.038
tell 'em to leave.

23:10.693 --> 23:12.216
Go ahead, Zara.

23:30.931 --> 23:32.715
So, we have
no communication with Eric?

23:32.759 --> 23:33.803
No.

23:33.847 --> 23:35.022
But everything is set up.

23:35.065 --> 23:36.173
As long as there aren't
any hiccups,

23:36.197 --> 23:37.392
the kids will get
their parents back.

23:37.416 --> 23:38.634
Okay,

23:38.678 --> 23:41.637
just get here and we'll
figure it out. Okay.

23:41.681 --> 23:43.204
Okay, I'm coming to you now.

23:57.479 --> 23:59.873
Okay, good news,
they've agreed to release

23:59.916 --> 24:02.658
your parents for the money.
Really?

24:02.702 --> 24:04.225
My gosh, that's so good.

24:04.268 --> 24:07.402
Nolan, did you hear that?

24:07.446 --> 24:09.448
Nolan.

24:09.491 --> 24:11.014
What's wrong, little man?

24:11.058 --> 24:12.538
Hey, Nolan. Buddy, listen,

24:12.581 --> 24:15.715
this is a good thing.

24:15.758 --> 24:17.717
We've done thousands
of negotiations.

24:17.760 --> 24:19.501
Everyone always comes home safe.

24:26.769 --> 24:30.077
Nolan, do you...
do you know something?

24:31.644 --> 24:34.690
Nolan, if you do,
please tell us.

24:34.734 --> 24:36.083
It would really help.

24:36.126 --> 24:39.652
Here. Nolan...

24:39.695 --> 24:41.436
this woman,

24:41.480 --> 24:45.222
she's saying something,
yelling something, right?

24:46.659 --> 24:47.747
Okay, there's a step.

24:47.790 --> 24:49.226
Now, is... now,

24:49.270 --> 24:51.577
is she saying she's gonna
hurt someone?

24:51.620 --> 24:53.709
There's a nod.

24:53.753 --> 24:55.537
Now we're talking.
You see what I did there?

24:55.581 --> 24:56.712
That was a little joke.

24:59.541 --> 25:03.937
Okay, here's the hard part,
actually talking.

25:05.982 --> 25:07.549
You know what I used to do

25:07.593 --> 25:10.509
when I was your age
and I was scared?

25:10.552 --> 25:11.640
I'd close my eyes

25:11.684 --> 25:14.643
and I'd say aloud exactly

25:14.687 --> 25:17.646
what the thing was
that I feared.

25:17.690 --> 25:20.736
Naming it made me feel like

25:20.780 --> 25:23.739
it didn't have control over me.

25:23.783 --> 25:25.021
Like I wasn't scared,
even if I was.

25:25.045 --> 25:28.744
She told the man
to get the money...

25:30.093 --> 25:32.879
then to kill everyone.

25:32.922 --> 25:35.142
She said Mom and Dad
had betrayed her,

25:35.185 --> 25:39.538
and that nobody
who betrays her lives.

25:41.931 --> 25:43.280
It's okay.

25:43.324 --> 25:45.674
Good boy.

25:48.068 --> 25:51.027
Why didn't you tell your kids?

25:51.071 --> 25:53.639
Because we didn't think
they were ready.

25:53.682 --> 25:55.728
We just wanted them to grow up

25:55.771 --> 25:57.294
normally. Yeah.

25:57.338 --> 25:58.663
I'm not sure Taylor thinks
you've been

25:58.687 --> 26:00.099
terribly successful
in that endeavor.

26:00.123 --> 26:01.734
Yeah, I know.

26:01.777 --> 26:04.171
I mean, we're not perfect.

26:04.214 --> 26:06.739
That's evident in the fact
we worked for Frances once.

26:06.782 --> 26:11.178
Well, when the kids came,
we just wanted out.

26:11.221 --> 26:14.268
When you put away
someone like Frances,

26:14.311 --> 26:15.835
we knew if we were
gonna start over

26:15.878 --> 26:17.663
and have any semblance
of a decent life,

26:17.706 --> 26:19.229
we needed that cash.

26:22.189 --> 26:24.800
You keep weapons in the house?
What? No.

26:24.844 --> 26:26.778
Really? Because I saw a box
of ammo on your bedroom floor.

26:26.802 --> 26:29.588
It had... remnants
of duct tape on it,

26:29.631 --> 26:31.633
like it had been
hidden somewhere.

26:31.677 --> 26:33.722
You told me you got rid of it.

26:33.766 --> 26:37.726
How could I?

26:37.770 --> 26:39.815
Knowing this might
happen one day?

26:39.859 --> 26:44.254
Well, where was it then,
when they were beating us?

26:44.298 --> 26:45.865
The kids don't know I have it.

26:45.908 --> 26:47.475
Well, Mr. Thomas,

26:47.518 --> 26:49.825
I think that...

26:49.869 --> 26:51.218
I think that Taylor might.

26:54.613 --> 26:57.703
Frances is going
to kill them, even if we pay.

26:57.746 --> 26:58.704
So, what are we gonna do?

26:58.747 --> 26:59.811
We can't just
hand over the money.

26:59.835 --> 27:00.943
Taylor, I know
this is a setback,

27:00.967 --> 27:03.230
but we've dealt with
setbacks before.

27:03.273 --> 27:04.713
If we could get in touch
with Eric...

27:06.189 --> 27:08.627
Get in the other room
with Nolan.

27:19.812 --> 27:21.552
What the hell is going on?

27:21.596 --> 27:22.858
Tony Rankin, U.S. Marshal.

27:33.434 --> 27:34.870
I became alerted to

27:34.914 --> 27:36.611
the Thomases' situation
this morning

27:36.655 --> 27:38.265
after Sylvia Winwood,
the U.S. Marshal

27:38.308 --> 27:40.267
in charge of the family,
was found murdered.

27:40.310 --> 27:41.921
AuntSylvia. I grabbed her phone

27:41.964 --> 27:43.226
and found Ms. Hallam's number.

27:43.270 --> 27:44.793
He tracked me using
my cell's GPS.

27:44.837 --> 27:47.274
A couple of days ago,
Taylor's parents alerted Sylvia

27:47.317 --> 27:49.363
of a photo posted online
of their daughter.

27:49.406 --> 27:52.192
Turns out Frances's organization
posted it themselves

27:52.235 --> 27:53.497
to smoke out the family.

27:53.541 --> 27:55.021
- It worked.
- It did.

27:55.064 --> 27:57.937
We figure before Sylvia could
even check into the post,

27:57.980 --> 27:59.784
Frances's men showed up at
Sylvia's apartment in New York.

27:59.808 --> 28:02.855
Now she's dead. She has Taylor

28:02.898 --> 28:04.987
and Nolan's parents,
along with our boss.

28:05.031 --> 28:06.989
Ms. Hallam told me.

28:07.033 --> 28:08.774
The most important
thing now, though,

28:08.817 --> 28:10.297
is the safety of the children.

28:10.340 --> 28:12.014
Under the direction of
Canadian law enforcement,

28:12.038 --> 28:14.954
I've been given permission
to take them into custody

28:14.997 --> 28:16.303
until everything is settled.

28:16.346 --> 28:19.741
We're going to
a Sûreté du Québec safe house.

28:22.004 --> 28:23.919
Yeah.

28:23.963 --> 28:26.835
Okay. That makes sense.

28:26.879 --> 28:29.838
Could you step outside and
let us break it to them, though?

28:29.882 --> 28:32.188
They've, had a rough time.

28:33.712 --> 28:35.714
So...

28:35.757 --> 28:37.672
what's in the bag?

28:39.152 --> 28:42.459
Were you planning on telling me about this?
We can explain.

28:42.503 --> 28:43.765
I'm sure you can.

28:43.809 --> 28:45.549
But considering
the Thomases' connection

28:45.593 --> 28:47.856
to organized crime,
it's my duty to seize this.

28:47.900 --> 28:49.336
Yeah, you can't do that.

28:49.379 --> 28:50.946
We're meeting Frances
in an hour.

28:53.035 --> 28:54.820
You have a meeting scheduled
with a woman

28:54.863 --> 28:56.517
who murdered a U.S. Marshal?

28:56.560 --> 28:58.320
Yes, and you can't
take that money because...

28:58.345 --> 28:59.999
Maybe he can.

29:00.042 --> 29:01.803
Nolan told us that Frances
isn't planning on keeping up

29:01.827 --> 29:03.263
her end of the bargain.

29:03.306 --> 29:05.787
Since she isn't acting
in good faith...

29:05.831 --> 29:08.007
- We need to switch up our plan.
- What, exactly,

29:08.050 --> 29:09.486
are you getting at, Ms. Walker?

29:09.530 --> 29:10.531
A sting.

29:10.574 --> 29:12.838
We go to the meet
with the money,

29:12.881 --> 29:14.927
you contact your liaison
at the Sûreté du Québec

29:14.970 --> 29:16.580
and have them standing by.

29:16.624 --> 29:19.192
We make the exchange,
and when the parents are safe,

29:19.235 --> 29:20.802
the Sûreté steps in.

29:20.846 --> 29:22.475
U.S. Marshal Service
already failed them once.

29:22.499 --> 29:24.023
This is your chance

29:24.066 --> 29:25.241
to make it better.

29:30.856 --> 29:32.901
I'll get in touch
with the Sûreté du Québec

29:32.945 --> 29:34.661
to get a team sorted,
and then I'll take the kids

29:34.685 --> 29:36.470
to a safe house
outside of the city.

29:38.037 --> 29:39.865
Thank you.

29:39.908 --> 29:42.128
I know you guys are nervous,

29:42.171 --> 29:43.999
but this is the best thing.

29:44.043 --> 29:46.001
Frances will be arrested,
sent back to prison,

29:46.045 --> 29:47.786
and everything will be
back to normal.

29:47.829 --> 29:49.004
Normal?

29:49.048 --> 29:50.136
What's that?

29:50.179 --> 29:51.877
Money's loaded in the SUV.

29:51.920 --> 29:53.704
Marshal's waiting
for you guys in the car.

29:53.748 --> 29:56.882
Okay, give it up.

30:08.894 --> 30:11.984
When you have your money...
You'll have them.

30:12.027 --> 30:13.376
And you'll leave them alone

30:13.420 --> 30:14.900
so they can move on
with their lives?

30:14.943 --> 30:17.903
They stole from me, Beaumont.

30:17.946 --> 30:21.558
But they won't die by my hand.

30:21.602 --> 30:23.038
Boss.

30:23.082 --> 30:25.127
What?

30:25.171 --> 30:26.346
They've split up.

30:26.389 --> 30:28.696
The Marshal's not headed
to the exchange.

30:28.739 --> 30:30.045
Let's stick to the plan,

30:30.089 --> 30:32.439
but I'll get the Marshal.

30:32.482 --> 30:33.614
You want to call it off?

30:33.657 --> 30:35.572
No.

30:35.616 --> 30:37.357
One of them's got my money.

31:07.909 --> 31:09.258
Okay.

31:30.366 --> 31:33.108
Money. Hang on.

31:56.175 --> 31:57.176
Move.

31:57.219 --> 31:59.743
Okay, easy. Get out.

32:10.189 --> 32:12.539
Yeah. Get them.

32:12.582 --> 32:14.106
Thank you.

32:14.149 --> 32:15.890
- Where are our kids?
- They're okay.

32:15.934 --> 32:17.346
The U.S. Marshal took them
to a safe house.

32:17.370 --> 32:18.782
As soon as the police
see that you're fine,

32:18.806 --> 32:20.131
they'll take you there.
Whoa, Marshal?

32:20.155 --> 32:21.635
Yeah. No, no.

32:21.678 --> 32:23.811
That must be who
she's gone after.

32:37.956 --> 32:40.045
Oliver, Frances knows. What?

32:40.088 --> 32:42.110
One of her guys was alerted
to something at the last minute.

32:42.134 --> 32:43.676
I saw them,
they were tracking something.

32:43.700 --> 32:44.963
Must've been the Marshal.

32:45.006 --> 32:46.114
She thinks he has her money.

32:46.138 --> 32:47.791
The kids.

32:47.835 --> 32:49.271
No. No.

32:49.315 --> 32:50.335
Okay. Anita... Wait! Wait!

32:50.359 --> 32:52.100
Lucas, take it easy.
It's under control.

32:52.144 --> 32:54.755
Everything's gonna be fine.

32:54.798 --> 32:56.191
I know the location.

32:56.235 --> 32:59.238
I think Taylor's got a gun.

32:59.281 --> 33:00.543
Yeah.

33:04.939 --> 33:06.201
Not much further now.

33:06.245 --> 33:09.204
You guys doing okay?

33:09.248 --> 33:11.424
Good.

33:14.557 --> 33:17.082
What the hell?

33:21.434 --> 33:24.176
Hey, kids. I'm sorry,

33:24.219 --> 33:26.265
but your driver might just have
a little something

33:26.308 --> 33:27.308
that belongs to me.

33:43.064 --> 33:45.110
That was three times.

33:45.153 --> 33:46.313
Something's wrong. Try again.

33:49.157 --> 33:51.333
- Marshal, this is...
- Mr. Beaumont.

33:51.377 --> 33:53.292
We had a deal.

33:53.335 --> 33:54.356
Where are the kids, Frances?

33:54.380 --> 33:56.512
They're safe. Unfortunately,

33:56.556 --> 33:57.687
the Marshal isn't.

33:57.731 --> 34:01.561
All right, um,
l-let's talk, okay?

34:01.604 --> 34:03.476
Talk? Now?

34:03.519 --> 34:05.347
After you set me up?

34:05.391 --> 34:06.479
Hey. Out.

34:06.522 --> 34:07.915
You had no plans

34:07.958 --> 34:09.917
to let that family live.
Now you listen to me.

34:09.960 --> 34:11.918
Come on. Out.

34:11.962 --> 34:15.270
The Marshal didn't have
the money,

34:15.313 --> 34:17.054
but he did have these kids,

34:17.098 --> 34:20.884
so you tell Mr. and Mrs. Thomas
unless I get that $2.5 million

34:20.928 --> 34:23.235
they owe me, I'm keeping them.

34:23.277 --> 34:25.672
I don't like kids.

34:25.715 --> 34:28.239
They annoy me.

34:28.283 --> 34:30.110
So, when I get annoyed...

34:31.504 --> 34:33.158
Frances?

34:49.217 --> 34:50.304
Nolan, run.

34:50.349 --> 34:51.958
Stupid girl. Run, Nolan!

34:52.002 --> 34:54.179
- Drop it. Drop your gun.
- I can see

34:54.222 --> 34:55.547
how hard you're
trying to be tough.

34:55.571 --> 34:57.443
I could just walk
right over there

34:57.486 --> 34:59.532
and take that gun
out of your hand.

35:01.273 --> 35:04.145
Know what I do to people
who threaten me?

35:04.189 --> 35:06.365
I'm not threatening you.
I'm gonna kill you.

35:06.408 --> 35:08.889
Even if you get your money
and leave, it won't matter.

35:08.932 --> 35:11.239
Your parents took
what was mine, you know.

35:11.283 --> 35:12.240
They're not good people, Taylor.

35:12.284 --> 35:15.809
Shut up. Shut up!

35:15.852 --> 35:18.116
As long as you're alive,
my family will always

35:18.159 --> 35:20.379
have to look
over their shoulder.

35:20.422 --> 35:23.251
And if I kill you right now, we
won't have to do that anymore.

35:32.739 --> 35:34.654
Taylor! I got it.

35:34.697 --> 35:37.744
Taylor, put the gun down.

35:37.787 --> 35:39.572
- No.
- We're here.

35:39.615 --> 35:40.921
The police are here.

35:40.964 --> 35:43.532
Frances will go to jail
for kidnapping, for murder.

35:43.576 --> 35:45.447
She'll never get out. Taylor!

35:45.491 --> 35:47.797
It doesn't matter.

35:47.841 --> 35:49.451
Locking her back up
won't do anything.

35:49.495 --> 35:51.061
She still has her men.

35:51.105 --> 35:53.629
What if she escapes,
or-or gets let out?

35:53.673 --> 35:55.065
She needs to die.

35:55.109 --> 35:57.503
Okay, Taylor, if you
believe putting a bullet

35:57.546 --> 35:58.808
in her head is gonna make you

35:58.852 --> 36:00.134
and your family free,
you're mistaken.

36:00.158 --> 36:02.551
Taking a human life will
stay with you forever.

36:02.595 --> 36:03.813
Good.

36:03.857 --> 36:05.380
I hope it does

36:05.424 --> 36:07.165
'cause each time I remember,

36:07.208 --> 36:09.645
I'll think of what it gave us,

36:09.689 --> 36:10.907
a normal life.

36:10.951 --> 36:12.735
Yeah, but your life
won't be normal.

36:12.779 --> 36:14.278
There are people,
really strong people,

36:14.302 --> 36:15.932
who have killed others
for the right reasons,

36:15.956 --> 36:18.306
self-defense or to save
a loved one, and their lives

36:18.350 --> 36:20.482
still turned out to be
the opposite of normal,

36:20.526 --> 36:21.222
the opposite of free.

36:21.266 --> 36:22.745
Taylor, it shatters them.

36:22.789 --> 36:27.315
I don't want
to live like this anymore.

36:27.359 --> 36:28.403
You don't have to.

36:28.447 --> 36:30.405
Okay, Taylor.

36:30.449 --> 36:32.277
Look at me.

36:35.193 --> 36:36.473
Taylor, put down
the gun, please.

36:36.498 --> 36:39.109
Just put it down.

36:44.332 --> 36:48.249
It's okay. It's okay.

36:48.293 --> 36:51.252
It's okay, it's over.

36:53.385 --> 36:55.691
Taylor! Taylor!

36:55.735 --> 36:57.476
Mom!

37:06.572 --> 37:08.574
Eric.

37:08.617 --> 37:10.793
Is everything okay?

37:28.376 --> 37:29.682
Hey, guys.

37:29.725 --> 37:31.727
Who's ready for ice cream?

37:31.771 --> 37:34.556
I am. Let's go then.

37:34.600 --> 37:37.167
And afterwards, we thought maybe

37:37.211 --> 37:39.344
we'd stop by the mall,
pick up a couple of things.

37:39.387 --> 37:40.606
Like what?

37:40.649 --> 37:42.651
I don't know,
like some new clothes,

37:42.695 --> 37:45.001
or a smartphone?

37:45.045 --> 37:47.090
Seriously? Totally.

38:32.832 --> 38:35.878
Thank you so much.
No, no, we had to.

38:35.922 --> 38:38.359
There was no way Frances
would ever leave you guys alone.

38:38.403 --> 38:41.449
And nice job playing along
and sneaking out the back.

38:41.493 --> 38:43.451
You know, at first I wasn't sure

38:43.495 --> 38:45.671
about this whole
strawberry, minty,

38:45.714 --> 38:49.588
sprinkly thing, but I think you
might be on to something.

38:51.851 --> 38:54.114
So...

38:54.157 --> 38:56.508
guys, how does it feel?

38:56.551 --> 39:00.512
To finally, actually
be free, to relocate

39:00.555 --> 39:02.644
and move on with your lives?

39:02.688 --> 39:04.516
No more looking
over your shoulder.

39:04.559 --> 39:06.735
And no more seeing you.

39:06.779 --> 39:09.521
Yeah, that's true,
but, you know,

39:09.564 --> 39:11.000
we'll always have this place.

39:13.089 --> 39:14.569
Aw.

39:17.920 --> 39:21.402
Um, you know, I'm really sorry

39:21.446 --> 39:24.536
for everything.

39:24.579 --> 39:25.972
Everything I-I said.

39:26.015 --> 39:27.452
For the gun...

39:27.495 --> 39:29.454
Taylor, stop. You don't have to.

39:29.497 --> 39:32.848
Just promise me one thing.

39:32.892 --> 39:34.981
Wherever you do end up,

39:35.024 --> 39:36.635
you won't change.

39:37.679 --> 39:39.420
Okay.

39:39.464 --> 39:41.944
Good. And, for the record...

39:41.988 --> 39:44.556
No. Yes. This scarf...

39:45.992 --> 39:48.037
is fire. No.

39:48.081 --> 39:49.169
Yeah.

39:49.212 --> 39:50.451
Yeah, you want to try it on?
It's fire.

39:50.475 --> 39:51.998
You want to, you want to...

40:05.751 --> 40:07.056
Don't look at me like that.
