FOREVER YOUNG

05:34.570 --> 05:36.083
- ARE YOU SURE
THIS IS GONNA BE ENOUGH FOOD?

05:36.120 --> 05:37.815
BECAUSE I MADE THESE
RESERVATIONS AT MONTICELLI'S.

05:37.850 --> 05:39.397

ON A DUMB GAME,

06:28.520 --> 06:30.829
JUST THINK
ABOUT WHAT A SMART GAME

06:30.870 --> 06:33.907

THIS COULD BE REALLY FUN.

08:50.320 --> 08:52.868
AND IT'S NOT A BRIBE.
I DON'T BRIBE.

08:52.910 --> 08:55.663
MAYBE IT'S A LITTLE BIT
OF A BRIBE.

08:57.190 --> 09:01.775
WHAT DO YOU THINK
ABOUT NANTUCKET GREEN, HUH?

09:01.810 --> 09:03.801

WE'RE GONNA HAVE FUN
DOING IT.

09:08.400 --> 09:10.709
I'LL SMILE,
AND YOU CAN BE MAD.

09:10.750 --> 09:11.921

I'VE GOT BLEEKER BEIGE,
AND THESE PA'I'I'ERNS

09:14.690 --> 09:19.309

JUST GO AHEAD AND SCOOP IT UP
WITH YOUR HANDS

09:55.900 --> 09:57.128
AND THEN WASH IT.

09:57.180 --> 09:58.693

TO DO ANY LAUNDRY.

09:58.730 --> 10:00.072
I'M JUST COMING IN HERE

10:00.110 --> 10:01.930
- YEAH. I WON'T.

10:01.980 --> 10:03.868
WHY NOT?

10:09.780 --> 10:11.702
AND I FEEL NERVOUS
AND STUFF.

10:11.740 --> 10:13.219
- I UNDERSTAND.

10:13.260 --> 10:15.194
YOUR DAD USED TO PLAY STUFF
FOR ME, YOU KNOW,

10:15.230 --> 10:18.711
BEFORE IT WAS READY,
AND H WAS PRETI'Y HELPFUL.

10:18.750 --> 10:22.379

THE SCRUFFY KID
WHO ACTS LIKE HE'S JOHNNY ZEN,

13:17.410 --> 13:19.059
BUT HE'S REALLY JUST A SLACKER
IN A VIDEO STORE

13:19.100 --> 13:20.579
WHO DOESN'T HAVE THE DRIVE
TO RING UP A SALE

13:20.620 --> 13:21.894

HOW TO WORK THIS?

13:40.300 --> 13:41.437

OR AM I THE TURTLE?

13:47.440 --> 13:50.307
- YOU'RE THE ROBOT.
- GOT IT.

13:53.000 --> 13:54.274
- YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M NOT GONNA DO THIS.

13:54.310 --> 13:55.413
I'M MAKING MYSELF SICK.

13:55.450 --> 13:56.894
I'M NOT GONNA COMPLAIN

ALL YOU NEED TO DO 15--

FOR NOT THINKING OF THAT.

15:18.220 --> 15:20.597

IT THE HARD WAY.

15:20.640 --> 15:22.119

- THAT'S SO EXCITING.
YOU SEEM EXCITED AND HAPPY.

15:36.410 --> 15:38.651
WHY ARE YOUR PARENTS
NOT EXCITED AND HAPPY?

15:38.690 --> 15:40.658
- BECAUSE THEY'RE JUST
STRESSED OUT

15:40.690 --> 15:43.511
BECAUSE HE HAD
A BAD CHILDHOOD, HONESTLY.

15:43.560 --> 15:47.246
HIS MOM DIED,
AND HIS DAD USED TO DRINK,

15:47.290 --> 15:50.350
AND THEN HE DRANK TOO,
BUT HE'S FINE NOW.

15:50.390 --> 15:52.255
AND HE'S IN A.A.,
AND HE'S SO GOOD.

15:52.290 --> 15:53.359
- HE'S IN A.A.?

15:53.400 --> 15:56.392
- HE'S BEEN THERE
FOR SIX MONTHS, AND HE'S OKAY.

15:56.430 --> 15:59.672
- WHOA. OKAY.

15:59.710 --> 16:02.361

16:02.400 --> 16:03.674
- I CAN HANDLE IT.
THANKS A LOT.

16:03.720 --> 16:06.120
- YOU'RE WELCOME.
- I APPRECIATE IT.

16:06.170 --> 16:09.685
- OKAY, EXPLAIN TO ME
WHY YOU'RE IN MY OFFICE

16:09.720 --> 16:11.403
WHEN I'M NOT THE ONE
THAT CAN HELP YOU

16:11.450 --> 16:13.589
WITH YOUR SITUATION.

16:13.620 --> 16:15.508
- BECAUSE IT'S HUMILIATING.

16:15.560 --> 16:18.313
I DON'T WANT TO ASK JOEL
TO COME BACK,

16:18.350 --> 16:19.624
BECAUSE THEN
I'D BE ADMITI'ING

16:19.660 --> 16:21.719
THAT THE PLAY FELL APART
WHEN HE QUIT.

16:21.770 --> 16:25.069
- CROS, THE PLAY FELL APART
WHEN HE QUIT.

16:25.120 --> 16:27.497
- WOW. OKAY.
SO YOU'VE ALREADY PICKED A SIDE.

16:27.530 --> 16:30.328
YOU JUST BETRAYED THAT BOND
BETWEEN BROTHER AND SISTER.

16:30.360 --> 16:32.157
- NOBODY'S CHOOSING SIDES.

16:32.190 --> 16:33.532
- OKAY, WELL,
IF YOU HAD TO PICK--

16:33.570 --> 16:36.698
- JOEL.
- WOW. THAT WAS QUICK.

16:36.750 --> 16:39.503
- CROS, HE'S JUST--
HE'S ANNOYINGLY GOOD

16:39.550 --> 16:43.259
AT THIS KIND OF THING.

16:43.310 --> 16:44.709
- YEAH.

16:47.070 --> 16:50.517
I JUST KIND OF THOUGHT
I WAS GONNA BE GOOD AT IT.

16:50.560 --> 16:52.346
- YOU'LL GET THERE.

16:52.390 --> 16:54.620
- YOU THINK I'LL GET THERE
IN THE NEXT WEEK?

16:54.660 --> 16:57.311
- LISTEN, CROS,
YOU THINK THE DEFINITION

16:57.360 --> 16:59.624
OF A GOOD PARENT IS ONE
THAT'S SUCCESSFUL ALL THE TIME,

16:59.670 --> 17:01.524
BUT SOMETIMES THE DEFINITION
OF A GOOD PARENT

17:01.570 --> 17:05.495
IS JUST ONE WHO KNOWS
WHEN IT'S TIME TO EAT CROW

17:05.540 --> 17:07.428
AND ADMIT THAT YOU'VE HAD
YOUR ASS HANDED TO YOU

17:07.470 --> 17:08.846
BY A CLASS OF SIX-YEAR-OLDS.

17:08.880 --> 17:10.359
- MM-HMM.

17:10.400 --> 17:13.164
WELL, I HAVE CERTAINLY HAD
MY ASS HANDED TO ME

17:13.200 --> 17:15.304
BY A CLASS
OF SIX-YEAR-OLDS, SO...

17:15.340 --> 17:18.377
- SO NOW THE ONLY HONORABLE
THING LEFI' TO DO

17:18.410 --> 17:22.449
IS TO ASK FOR HELP.

17:22.480 --> 17:24.687
- FROM JOEL.

17:24.730 --> 17:26.516
- THE ONE AND ONLY.

17:26.560 --> 17:30.553
- [sighs]

17:35.120 --> 17:36.451
- [gaSPSJ

17:36.500 --> 17:39.116
HI. [laughs]

I PICKED UP A FEW SAMPLES,
AND I THOUGHT I'D GET STARTED

17:41.330 --> 17:42.490
JUST TO SHOW YOU WHAT I FOUND.

17:42.540 --> 17:45.668
- OKAY. IS THIS THE STUFF,
ON THE BED, FROM THE TABLE?

17:45.710 --> 17:47.507
- YES, THAT WAS HERE,
BUT IT'S ALL INTACT.

17:47.540 --> 17:48.677
DON'T WORRY.

17:48.720 --> 17:50.506
- I'M NOT WORRIED.
I JUST NEED A BOOK.

17:50.550 --> 17:52.438
- SO WHAT DO YOU THINK? DO YOU
LIKE THIS ONE--THE PURPLE?

17:52.480 --> 17:53.572
- YEAH. YEAH.

17:53.620 --> 17:56.373
- YEAH. I LIKE IT.

17:56.420 --> 18:00.789

18:00.830 --> 18:03.526
WHAT DO YOU SAY
WE--WE HANG OUT, PAINT,

18:03.560 --> 18:05.312
MAYBE ORDER A PIZZA--

18:05.360 --> 18:09.353
I DON'T KNOW--
PUT ON SOME MUSIC?

18:09.390 --> 18:11.119
- UM...

18:11.150 --> 18:14.495
I'M GOING TO THE MOVIES
WITH AMBER ON FRIDAY.

18:14.540 --> 18:17.259
- OKAY. THAT'S FINE.

18:17.300 --> 18:19.530
UM, WE CAN MAYBE DO IT
OVER THE WEEKEND,

18:19.580 --> 18:20.649
MAYBE SATURDAY.

18:20.680 --> 18:23.786
I CAN STAY IN FRIDAY NIGHT
AND PAINT A BIG PATCH

18:23.820 --> 18:25.811
JUST TO SEE HOW--
HOW IT LOOKS.

18:25.860 --> 18:27.543
- OKAY.
- YEAH?

18:27.580 --> 18:29.616
- YEAH. YOU DON'T MIND
DOING IT ON SATURDAY?

18:29.660 --> 18:32.379
- NO. I WANT TO DO IT.
I REALLY DO.

18:32.420 --> 18:35.480
I LOOK FORWARD TO IT.
- OKAY. GREAT.

18:35.520 --> 18:37.147
- GREAT.

18:37.180 --> 18:40.149
IT'S A DATE.
- YEAH.

18:40.180 --> 18:45.732
- JUST HANGING AROUND
TILL 2:00 OR 3:00

18:45.770 --> 18:50.252
TREATING ME WELL

18:50.300 --> 18:52.700
- IT'S SO GOOD.
- OOH, I HAVE A QUESTION.

18:52.750 --> 18:54.570
THERE'S A PART THAT GOES--
- IT'S SO GOOD, BY THE WAY.

18:54.610 --> 18:56.578
IT'S SO GOOD.
- STOP CRYING.

18:56.610 --> 18:58.475
- I'M NOT. IT'S BEAUTIFUL.
- I FEEL EMBARRASSED.

18:58.510 --> 19:00.330
- IT'S BEAUTIFUL.
- LISTEN, I NEED HELP.

19:00.380 --> 19:01.824
OKAY, IT GOES...

19:01.860 --> 19:04.613
WOULD YOU WAKE ME
WHEN YOU LEAVE?

19:04.660 --> 19:06.651
BUT I COULD ALSO GO...

19:06.690 --> 19:10.319
WOULD YOU WAKE ME
WHEN YOU LEAVE?

19:10.350 --> 19:12.830
- I LOVE THAT.
I LOVE THAT, ON THE SECOND ONE.

19:12.870 --> 19:15.839
- THAT'S GOOD, BECAUSE
THE SECOND ONE IS SADDER.

19:15.870 --> 19:19.829
IT'S LIKE...
I'LL BE SEEING YOU AGAIN

19:19.880 --> 19:20.835
- VERY NICE.
- YEAH?

19:20.880 --> 19:22.802
- REALLY PRETTY. YEAH. YEAH.
- OKAY. COOL.

19:22.850 --> 19:24.533
- AND THEN IT GOES...

19:24.570 --> 19:28.643
OOH OOH OOH OOH

19:32.240 --> 19:34.504
- BUT--SO--

19:34.550 --> 19:36.541
HONEY.
- I ALWAYS FORGET THIS PART.

19:36.580 --> 19:38.332
- I KNOW. DON'T--DON'T DO IT.
DON'T DO IT.

19:38.380 --> 19:39.608
YOU KNOW, YOU DON'T NEED
THAT LICK.

19:39.660 --> 19:41.446
JUST KEEP GOING.
LEAVE IT CLEAN.

19:41.490 --> 19:42.445
- NO. IT SOUNDS GOOD.

19:42.490 --> 19:44.549
IT REALLY, LIKE,
ADDS SOME COMPLEXITY TO IT.

19:44.590 --> 19:46.581
- OH, BUT, HONEY, YOU'RE GOING
TO BE SO MUCH MORE NERVOUS

19:46.630 --> 19:47.836
THAN YOU THINK
WHEN YOU GET UP THERE

19:47.870 --> 19:49.553
WITH THE MICROPHONE
AND THE SOUND

19:49.600 --> 19:50.419
AND THE LIGHTS AND STUFF.

19:50.460 --> 19:51.552
YOU'RE GONNA GET
VERY, VERY NERVOUS.

19:51.600 --> 19:54.012
AND I JUST FEEL LIKE YOU'RE
KIND OF CHOKING ON THAT.

19:54.050 --> 19:55.426
- MOM.
- I MEAN, IT'S--

19:55.470 --> 19:56.801
NO, 'CAUSE YOUR OTHER SONGS
WILL BE MORE--

19:56.850 --> 19:58.294
- PLEASE, I CAN'T THINK
ABOUT THAT.

19:58.330 --> 20:00.491
- I KNOW. NO, I'M JUST SAYING
IT'S VERY QUIET

20:00.540 --> 20:01.677
AND SIMPLE ALREADY.

20:01.710 --> 20:03.018
AND SO IT DOESN'T NEED
THE KIND OF--

20:03.060 --> 20:05.028
- SIMPLE?
- NO, IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

20:05.060 --> 20:07.403
IT'S NOT TOO SIMPLE.
IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

20:07.440 --> 20:09.237
IT JUST SEEMS
TO BE MAKING YOU TENSE

20:09.270 --> 20:10.953
TO--TO ADD THE EXTRA THING,
AND YOU DON'T NEED IT.

20:11.000 --> 20:12.547
- NOW I'M NERVOUS.

20:14.350 --> 20:16.375
I'M GONNA BE WORRIED
ABOUT HOW I LOOK DOING IT.

20:16.420 --> 20:17.682
- NEVER MIND.
YOU'RE RIGHT.

20:17.730 --> 20:19.618
I DON'T WANT TO MAKE YOU
FEEL WEIRD.

20:19.660 --> 20:21.867
IT WAS SO GOOD.
IT WAS SO GOOD.

20:32.710 --> 20:34.598
- SO WHAT ARE WE WEARING
TO THIS OPEN-MIC THING?

20:34.640 --> 20:37.359
HAVEN'T BEEN TO ONE OF THOSE
SINCE, UH, CROSBY'S PUNK BAND.

20:37.400 --> 20:38.674
DO YOU REMEMBER THAT?
WHAT WAS IT CALLED?

20:38.720 --> 20:40.335
THE BURNING SENSATION.

20:40.370 --> 20:43.498
[laughing]
- YOU GOT IT.

20:43.550 --> 20:45.268
- THEY WERE BAD.

20:45.310 --> 20:47.278
- I DON'T KNOW, MOM.
YOU ALWAYS LOOK PRETTY COOL.

20:47.310 --> 20:49.369
- OH.
- WELL, I'LL TELL YOU ONE THING,

20:49.420 --> 20:50.682
I CALLED ADAM
ABOUT CARPOOLING,

20:50.730 --> 20:53.039
AND HE DOESN'T KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT THIS.

20:53.070 --> 20:54.719
WE'RE STILL NOT SURE
IF EVERYBODY'S GONNA GET TO GO.

20:54.770 --> 20:56.385
- WE'RE GONNA GO.
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

20:56.420 --> 20:57.455
IT'S MY GRANDDAUGHTER.

20:57.490 --> 20:59.355
IF I WANT TO GO SEE
MY GRANDDAUGHTER PERFORM,

20:59.390 --> 21:00.357
I CAN GO SEE HER PERFORM.

21:00.390 --> 21:01.596
- YOU KNOW, DAD,

21:01.630 --> 21:02.904
LET'S, UH, TALK TO AMBER
ABOUT IT LATER.

21:02.950 --> 21:04.326
- LATER?
LET'S TALK ABOUT IT NOW.

21:04.360 --> 21:05.213
- DAD.

21:05.260 --> 21:06.602
- I DON'T CARE
IF YOU GUYS GO OR NOT.

21:06.640 --> 21:07.868
- YAY!
- OH.

21:07.920 --> 21:10.775
- BUT THERE'S A CATCH.
I WON'T BE THERE.

21:10.820 --> 21:12.082
- WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

21:12.130 --> 21:13.711
- I QUIT. I'M NOT DOING IT.
- NO, NO, NO.

21:13.750 --> 21:14.978
- Al-TER ALL THAT WORK YOU DID?

21:15.030 --> 21:16.099
- YEAH, I JUST DIDN'T FEEL
LIKE IT.

21:16.130 --> 21:18.303
ALSO, I'M GOING TO A MOVIE
WITH HADDIE ON FRIDAY.

21:18.340 --> 21:19.375
CAN I BORROW THE CAR?

21:19.410 --> 21:21.446
- YES. WAIT. NO.
WHAT HAPPENED?

21:21.480 --> 21:22.617
- IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL.

21:22.660 --> 21:24.309
I JUST DIDN'T FEEL
LIKE DOING IT, OKAY?

21:24.350 --> 21:25.374
- NO, NO, NO.
- PROBLEM SOLVED.

21:25.420 --> 21:27.376
- LET ME TAKE YOU TO SCHOOL.
- NO, THAT'S OKAY.

21:27.420 --> 21:30.344
I'LL TAKE THE BUS.

21:30.390 --> 21:31.766
- WHAT'S THAT ABOUT?

21:31.800 --> 21:35.497
- IT'S ABOUT ME.

21:35.530 --> 21:38.419
[knocking at door]

21:38.460 --> 21:40.348
- HEY.

21:40.400 --> 21:41.776
UM...
[clears throat]

21:41.810 --> 21:44.461
SO AS IT TURNS OUT,

21:44.510 --> 21:47.536
GOOD INTENTIONS AND RAW TALENT
AREN'T ENOUGH TO PULL OFF

21:47.580 --> 21:49.741
KIN DERGARTEN TH EATER.

21:49.790 --> 21:52.679
- WELL...

21:52.720 --> 21:55.848
- LOOK, MY--MY EGO
GOT THE BETTER OF ME, I THINK,

21:55.900 --> 21:59.028
AND, UM, I'M SORRY
ABOUT THAT.

21:59.070 --> 22:02.039
BUT I-I DON'T THINK THE KIDS
SHOULD BE PUNISHED FOR THAT

22:02.070 --> 22:04.413
OR THE PARENTS
THAT HAVE TO SIT THROUGH

22:04.460 --> 22:08.078
THIS TERRIBLE PLAY
I'VE CREATED.

22:08.110 --> 22:10.977
- WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

22:11.010 --> 22:14.355
- JOE, I'M--
I'M BEGGING YOU, MAN.

22:14.400 --> 22:15.321
YOU--YOU GOT TO COME BACK.

22:15.360 --> 22:17.419
IF YOU DON'T,
THIS--THIS PLAY'S GONNA BE

22:18.820 --> 22:23.473
SINCE THE EARTHQUAKE
OF 1905.

22:23.510 --> 22:25.740
190--1906?
- 6.

22:25.790 --> 22:27.758
- MAN, THE PLAY'S
ABOUT THE HISTORY OF CALIFORNIA.

22:27.790 --> 22:29.758
I DON'T EVEN KNOW.
- [sighs]

22:29.790 --> 22:32.418
- JOE, YOU GOT TO COME BACK.
- I DON'T KNOW, MAN. I JUST--

22:32.450 --> 22:36.136
- I'M NOT EQUIPPED TO DO THIS
WITHOUT YOU.

22:36.180 --> 22:40.935
- YEAH, I GOT--I GOT TO THINK
ABOUT IT A LITTLE.

22:40.980 --> 22:43.551
- OKAY.
- YEAH.

22:43.600 --> 22:46.660
CROSBY?
- YEAH?

22:46.710 --> 22:48.086
- I JUST--

22:48.120 --> 22:52.489
I AM KIDDING, MAN.

22:52.540 --> 22:54.019
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN
YOU'RE KIDDING?

22:54.060 --> 22:56.437
- YOUR SISTER TOLD ME
YOU'D BE COMING OVER.

22:56.470 --> 22:57.505
- SHE TOLD YOU
THAT I WAS COMING OVER?

22:57.540 --> 22:58.746
- I HEARD YOUR BIKE.

22:58.790 --> 23:00.610
- AND THEN YOU JUST LET ME
GO THROUGH THAT WHOLE SPEECH?

23:00.650 --> 23:02.572
- IT WAS A GREAT SPEECH.

23:02.620 --> 23:04.201
- THEN I TAKE IT ALL BACK.
- YOU CAN'T TAKE IT BACK.

23:04.240 --> 23:05.059
- NO, I DO.
- IT'S OUT THERE.

23:05.100 --> 23:06.169
GET IN HERE
AND HAVE A BEER WITH ME.

23:06.210 --> 23:08.963
- I DIDN'T MEAN ANY OF IT.
- I WANT TO SEE YOU DO

23:09.000 --> 23:10.103
THAT WHOLE THING AGAIN.

23:10.140 --> 23:11.960
WHAT WAS THE PART ABOUT YOU
DESPERATELY NEEDING ME?

23:12.010 --> 23:14.797
[Das Racists' Combination
Pizza Hut And Taco Bell]

23:14.840 --> 23:16.626
- WAIT, WHAT?
AT THE PIZZA HUT

23:16.670 --> 23:18.900
- WHAT?
- WHAT? AT THE TACO BELL

23:18.940 --> 23:22.489
- WHAT? THE COMBINATION
PIZZA HUT AND TACO BELL

23:22.530 --> 23:24.566
- WE AT THE PIZZA HUT
- NO

23:24.610 --> 23:26.419
- WE AT THIEIC'JI'ACO BELL

23:26.470 --> 23:28.119
- WE AT THE COMBINATION...

23:28.160 --> 23:31.778
- [sniffing]

23:31.820 --> 23:35.506
[loud music and chatter]

23:38.650 --> 23:41.471
- BRAVERMAN, COME HERE
A SEC, MAN.

23:41.520 --> 23:43.988
- I WANT ONE OF THOSE.
- CHECK THAT OUT.

23:44.040 --> 23:47.589
- CHECK OUT THIS ROBOT.
WHOO.

23:47.630 --> 23:51.452
- COOL. THAT'S RADICAL.

23:51.490 --> 23:53.492
UH, I DIDN'T THINK
YOU WERE COMING IN TODAY.

23:53.530 --> 23:55.566
- OH, YEAH, MAN,
WE JUST GOT HERE.

23:55.600 --> 23:57.147
CHECK IT.
THESE ARE A FEW OF MY PALS--

23:57.190 --> 24:00.603
SPIDER, TJ, SMOKEY.
- HEY, BRAVERMAN.

24:00.640 --> 24:02.460
- HI. SMOKEY.

24:02.510 --> 24:04.011
- SPIDER HERE HAS SOME REALLY
AMAZING SHOE IDEAS.

24:04.060 --> 24:05.539
SPIDER, TELL HIM.
- OKAY.

24:05.580 --> 24:07.502
- WELL, IT'S MORE OF A DRAWING
THAN AN IDEA,

24:07.540 --> 24:09.679
BUT YOU TAKE
ALL THE SHOE DEMONS

24:09.720 --> 24:12.473
OUT OF THE T&S THING...

24:12.520 --> 24:15.546
POW. KICKING A NEW FLAVOR.
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?

24:15.590 --> 24:16.989
- PUT THAT ON THE SOLE.
"POW."

24:17.040 --> 24:18.177
- NO, THE "POW"
IS IN YOUR BRAIN.

24:18.210 --> 24:21.008
SEE, IT'S LIKE THE SKULL,
BRAVERMAN, WITH THE HORNS.

24:21.040 --> 24:22.894
THAT'S ACT UALLY--
THE SHOE IS THINKING THAT.

24:22.940 --> 24:25.215
- SHOE DEMONS EXITING.

24:25.250 --> 24:27.047
- IT'S LIKE
IT'S BEING EXORCISED.

24:27.080 --> 24:30.561
- IT'S BEING EXTRACTED.
- IT'S A SHOE, BRAVERMAN.

24:30.600 --> 24:32.215
- RIGHT.

24:32.260 --> 24:34.603
YEAH, WELL, YOU'VE GIVEN ME
A LOT TO THINK ABOUT.

24:34.640 --> 24:36.119
CORY, CAN I SEE YOU
IN MY OFFICE?

24:36.160 --> 24:38.958
- YEAH, MAN,
AS SOON AS I'M DONE HERE--

24:38.990 --> 24:40.571
- IT CAN'T WAIT.

24:40.610 --> 24:43.613
- UH-OH, BUSTED, CORY.
BUSTED.

24:43.650 --> 24:48.098
[laughter]

24:48.140 --> 24:51.655
- THANK YOU.

24:51.690 --> 24:53.032
WHAT'S UP?

24:53.070 --> 24:55.766
- LISTEN, I DON'T KNOW
HOW YOU WORKED YOUR BUSINESS

24:55.800 --> 24:58.519
WITH THE VIDEO GAMES,
BUT THIS PLACE IS A LIVING,

24:58.560 --> 24:59.527
BREATHING COMPANY.

24:59.560 --> 25:00.595
WE MAKE SHOES.

25:00.630 --> 25:01.767
AND THERE ARE PEOPLE
WHO WORK HERE

25:01.810 --> 25:04.278
WHO NEED THIS COMPANY TO SUCCEED
WHETHER YOU DO OR NOT.

25:04.330 --> 25:06.184
- WAIT A MINUTE, OKAY?

25:06.220 --> 25:09.087
NO ONE WANTS T&S
TO BE GREAT AGAIN MORE ME.

25:09.120 --> 25:10.917
- REALLY? THEN I'D LIKE TO SEE
YOU ACT LIKE IT.

25:10.950 --> 25:12.770
STARTING TOMORROW, COME IN
DURING REGULAR BUSINESS HOURS.

25:12.820 --> 25:13.741
MEET YOUR DESIGN TEAM.

25:13.780 --> 25:15.953
THESE ARE GREAT PEOPLE
WITH GREAT IDEAS.

25:15.990 --> 25:17.548
THEY'RE ALSO PEOPLE
WITH FAMILIES

25:17.580 --> 25:19.093
WHO ARE SCARED TO DEATH
THAT YOU ARE GONNA RUN

25:19.130 --> 25:22.679
THIS PLACE
INTO THE GROUND.

25:22.720 --> 25:25.689
- IS THAT HOW YOU FEEL?

25:25.730 --> 25:26.867
- I DON'T KNOW YET.

25:26.900 --> 25:28.208
BUT Al-TER WHAT I JUST SAW
IN THERE,

25:28.250 --> 25:31.174
HONESTLY, THAT DOESN'T EVEN
BEGIN TO COVER MY FEARS.

25:31.210 --> 25:33.246
- I KNOW EXACTLY
WHAT I'M DOING.

25:33.290 --> 25:35.281
- OKAY, LISTEN, YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

25:35.320 --> 25:37.003
YOU DON'T HAVE
A MISSION STATEMENT.

25:37.050 --> 25:38.312
YOU DON'T HAVE
A BUSINESS PLAN.

25:38.360 --> 25:40.328
THE ONLY THING
THAT YOU'VE PRESENTED ME WITH

25:40.360 --> 25:42.635
IS THIS VAGUE IDEA
THAT SOMEHOW WE GOT WEIRD

25:42.670 --> 25:43.841
IN THE '905.

25:43.880 --> 25:45.017
- I DON'T HAVE AN ANSWER YET.

25:45.060 --> 25:46.368
- WELL, YOU BETTER COME UP
WITH ONE SOON.

25:46.400 --> 25:47.367
YOU BOUGHT THE COMPANY.

25:47.400 --> 25:48.503
YOU'RE THE GUY
WHO HAS TO HAVE THE ANSWER.

25:48.540 --> 25:51.122
- I KNOW WHAT THE PROBLEM IS.
- WELL, WHAT'S THAT?

25:51.170 --> 25:54.571
- YOU GUYS STARTED
SELLING OUT.

25:54.620 --> 25:56.781
NOW, COMING UP
WITH WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO

25:56.830 --> 25:58.206
IS A CREATIVE PROBLEM.

25:58.240 --> 26:00.617
IT'S EXCITING,
AND I'M WORKING ON IT.

26:00.660 --> 26:05.029
AND H WANT YOU TO BE WORKING
ON IT, TOO, WITH ME.

26:05.080 --> 26:07.696
- THAT'S IT?
- YEAH.

26:07.730 --> 26:10.142
THAT'S HOW PEOPLE SOLVE
PROBLEMS.

26:10.180 --> 26:11.875
THEY THINK ABOUT THEM.

26:11.910 --> 26:14.595
YOU CAN'T CONTROL
CREATIVITY, MAN.

26:14.640 --> 26:16.949
NOW, I AM COMPLETELY COMFORTABLE
WITH THE FACT

26:16.980 --> 26:18.732
THAT I DON'T HAVE
AN ANSWER YET.

26:18.780 --> 26:21.704
BUT YOU NEED TO BE COMFORTABLE
WITH THAT, TOO,

26:21.750 --> 26:23.672
BECAUSE WHATEVER WE DO,

26:23.720 --> 26:26.336
IT'S GOING TO INVOLVE
TAKING RISKS.

26:29.410 --> 26:31.617
BRAVERMAN.

26:31.650 --> 26:34.995
BRAVERMAN.
BRAVER MAN.

26:35.040 --> 26:38.339
- YES, YES, THAT'S MY NAME.
- I LIKE YOU, OKAY?

26:38.380 --> 26:40.792
YOU'RE A COOL DUDE.

26:40.840 --> 26:43.968
YOU'RE SMART, AND I WANT YOU
TO STICK AROUND.

26:44.010 --> 26:46.387
BUT WE'RE GOING TO BE GOING
FOR AN EXTREMELY

26:46.430 --> 26:48.637
YOUTH-ORIENTED PRODUCT.

26:48.670 --> 26:51.776
AND IT IS GOING
TO GET RADICAL.

26:51.810 --> 26:56.122
AND I JUST WANT
TO MAKE SURE...

26:56.160 --> 26:58.742
THAT YOU'RE UP FOR IT.

27:01.680 --> 27:03.887
- OKAY.

27:03.930 --> 27:06.262
- ARE YOU SURE?

27:06.310 --> 27:08.824
- I'M SURE.

27:08.860 --> 27:11.681
- COOL.

27:19.490 --> 27:23.017
- [sighs]

27:27.090 --> 27:28.250
- WHAT'S THE DEAL
WITH THE MOVIE?

27:28.300 --> 27:29.255
HOW DID IT GO?

27:29.300 --> 27:30.562
- WE WENT TO THE U.A. BERKELEY 7
ON SHATTUCK.

27:30.610 --> 27:33.056
AND I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT THEY
RAISED THE TICKET PRICES AGAIN.

27:33.090 --> 27:35.672
- AWFUL. SO RUDE. AND WHAT DID
YOU THINK ABOUT THE MOVIE?

27:35.720 --> 27:37.051
HOW DID YOU FEEL?
- WELL, I MEAN, IT WAS OKAY.

27:37.100 --> 27:38.431
BUT MICHAEL CERA
WAS OBVIOUSLY HILARIOUS.

27:38.480 --> 27:40.129
- OBVIOUSLY HILARIOUS
AND CUTE.

27:40.170 --> 27:42.445
- AND ADORABLE.
- YES. CORRECT.

27:42.480 --> 27:44.107
OKAY.
- OKAY, I THINK YOU GOT IT.

27:44.140 --> 27:46.244
THAT'S PRETTY MUCH
ALL THE BASES COVERED.

27:46.280 --> 27:48.726
- HOW DO I LOOK?

27:48.770 --> 27:51.079
- YOU LOOK BEAUTIFUL.

27:51.110 --> 27:53.214
- [laughs]
THANK YOU.

27:53.250 --> 27:54.933
THANK YOU, SERIOUSLY,
FOR EVERYTHING.

27:54.980 --> 27:56.971
I WILL CALL YOU
WHEN IT'S TIME TO PICK ME UP.

27:57.020 --> 27:58.419
- CAN I SAY SOMETHING,

27:58.460 --> 28:00.257
EVEN THOUGH
YOU'RE GONNA GET MAD AT ME?

28:00.290 --> 28:02.770
- OKAY.
- OKAY.

28:02.810 --> 28:04.459
DRINKING...

28:04.510 --> 28:06.887
I KNOW. BUT I JUST NEED
TO GET IT OUT.

28:06.920 --> 28:09.889
YOU KNOW THAT MY DAD DRANK,
AND IT WAS A BIG PROBLEM.

28:09.920 --> 28:11.956
- MM-HMM.
- OKAY.

28:12.000 --> 28:14.753
IT'S JUST THAT WHEN SOMEBODY
YOU LOVE DRINKS,

28:14.790 --> 28:17.998
IT'S LIKE THEY'RE
A DIFFERENT PERSON,

28:18.040 --> 28:19.109
AND YOU DON'T MATTER.

28:19.140 --> 28:21.859
AND IT CAN BE REALLY,
REALLY SCARY.

28:21.900 --> 28:23.515
AND I-I-I UNDERSTAND
THAT THIS GUY

28:23.560 --> 28:26.723
IS PROBABLY THE COOLEST GUY
IN THE WHOLE WORLD,

28:26.770 --> 28:29.807
AND I'M SURE IT WILL NEVER
BE A PROBLEM, HONESTLY.

28:29.840 --> 28:32.809
- ALEX IS OKAY.
- I KNOW. I KNOW.

28:32.840 --> 28:34.114
- HE'S BEEN SOBER
FOR SIX MONTHS.

28:34.160 --> 28:36.014
- I KNOW. BUT THAT'S NOT
VERY LONG.

28:36.050 --> 28:38.359
MY DAD WOULD HAVE LONGER
STRETCHES AND GO BACK INTO IT.

28:38.400 --> 28:39.742
I'M JUST SAYING.

28:39.780 --> 28:42.465
- I KNOW. I'M--I HEAR YOU.
I UNDERSTAND.

28:42.510 --> 28:45.297
- JUST BE AWARE, OKAY?

28:45.340 --> 28:47.194
OKAY?
- OKAY.

28:47.240 --> 28:49.549
- YEAH.
- YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY.

28:49.580 --> 28:52.378
YOU'RE MY RIDE HOME.
- VERY COMFORTING.

28:52.420 --> 28:54.376
OKAY, GREAT. I'LL CALL YOU.
THANK YOU.

28:54.420 --> 28:57.867
I AM LISTENING TO YOU.
- GO GET HIM.

28:57.900 --> 28:59.003
YOU LOOK GREAT.
- THANK YOU.

28:59.040 --> 29:01.861
- HE'S A LUCKY MAN.

29:09.020 --> 29:10.567
- UH-OH.
[chuckles]

29:10.610 --> 29:11.804
SHOULD I BE WORRIED?

29:11.850 --> 29:13.329
YOU'RE SITTING ALONE
IN THE DARK

29:13.370 --> 29:16.533
IN THE LAUNDRY ROOM
NOT DOING LAUNDRY?

29:16.580 --> 29:19.879
- I JUST CAN'T FIGURE OUT
HOW TO GET MY WHITES WHITER.

29:19.930 --> 29:22.956
- WHAT'S UP?
- OH, MOM.

29:23.000 --> 29:24.854
DO YOU EVER WORRY SO MUCH
ABOUT SOMETHING BAD

29:24.900 --> 29:26.470
HAPPENING TO ME
THAT YOU STOMPED OUT MY FIRE

29:26.520 --> 29:27.544
BY ACCIDENT?

29:27.590 --> 29:29.137
- I DON'T KNOW.

29:29.180 --> 29:32.069
YOU KNOW, WE ALL TRY
TO PROTECT OUR KIDS.

29:32.110 --> 29:33.520
IT'S WHAT WE DO.

29:33.560 --> 29:34.766
- MM-HMM.

29:34.800 --> 29:37.598
- THEN THEY GROW UP, AND WE
CAN'T PROTECT THEM ANYMORE.

29:37.630 --> 29:39.871
AND YOU'D SAVE YOURSELF
A LOT OF GRIEF

29:39.910 --> 29:41.070
IF YOU'D ACCEPT THAT FACT.

29:41.120 --> 29:44.248
I MEAN, WE CAN BE THERE
FOR THEM,

29:44.290 --> 29:46.565
BUT...

29:46.610 --> 29:50.057
WE CAN'T PROTECT THEM.

29:50.090 --> 29:51.842
I THINK IT'S ONE
OF THE TOUGHEST THINGS

29:51.890 --> 29:54.051
ABOUT BEING A PARENT.

30:01.620 --> 30:03.793
[door opens]

30:07.250 --> 30:10.595
- HEY.

30:10.630 --> 30:14.043
WHAT YOU READING?

30:14.080 --> 30:16.082
- IT'S A BOOK.

30:20.470 --> 30:24.156
- ALL RIGHT, WELL, I JUST CAME
TO SAY GOOD NIGHT, MAX.

30:24.200 --> 30:26.953
DID I EVER TELL YOU
YOU'RE A GOOD KID?

30:26.990 --> 30:28.878
- MM-HMM.

30:28.930 --> 30:30.989
- WELL, YOU STILL ARE.

30:37.930 --> 30:42.173
- WHY ARE YOU STILL HERE?

30:42.210 --> 30:46.169
- JUST LOST IN THOUGHT, I GUESS.
I'M JUST...

30:46.220 --> 30:49.633
I THINK MY BOSS
THINKS I'M TOO OLD.

30:49.670 --> 30:52.912
- HOW OLDHARE YOU?

30:52.950 --> 30:56.875
- THAT'S PRETTY OLD.

30:56.920 --> 30:59.468
- SWEET DREAMS, SON.

31:02.200 --> 31:03.474
- ARE WE NOT ALLOWED
TO BE OUT HERE?

31:03.510 --> 31:04.920
- WELL, IF I SAID
WE HAD PERMISSION,

31:04.960 --> 31:06.029
WILL IT MAKE IT
ANY LESS EXCITING?

31:06.070 --> 31:08.516
- NO. ACTUALLY, I'M VERY AFRAID
OF BREAKING RULES,

31:08.550 --> 31:12.862
WHICH IS STUPID, BUT--
OH, MY GOD.

31:15.210 --> 31:19.556
THIS IS BEAUTIFUL.

31:19.600 --> 31:21.215
WHAT IS THIS?

31:21.250 --> 31:24.947
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
HOW DID YOU SET ALL OF THIS UP?

31:24.980 --> 31:26.117
- I PULLED SOME STRINGS,

31:26.160 --> 31:28.663
YOU KNOW,
CALLED IN A FEW FAVORS.

31:28.710 --> 31:31.326
- THIS IS MY FAVORITE MOVIE.
- IT'S YOUR THIRD FAVORITE.

31:31.370 --> 31:32.632
YOUR FIRST IS LOVE ACTUALLY.

31:32.680 --> 31:34.056
BUT YOU ALREADY SAW IT
WITH THAT STEVE GUY,

31:34.090 --> 31:36.024
SO THAT WAS COMPLETELY OUT
OF THE QUESTION.

31:36.060 --> 31:37.027
- MM-HMM.

31:37.060 --> 31:38.470
- AND ALTHOUGH I LIKE YOU,

31:38.510 --> 31:40.330
NOT ENOUGH
TO SIT THROUGH TWILIGHT.

31:40.380 --> 31:42.996
- [laughs] I MEAN,
I JUST DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.

31:44.480 --> 31:46.482
- I TRY.

31:46.520 --> 31:48.033
COME ON.

31:48.070 --> 31:50.129
WE'RE MISSING THE MOVIE.

31:50.180 --> 31:52.933
- OKAY.

31:52.980 --> 31:55.448
SO CUTE.
WHERE DID YOU GET THIS?

31:55.490 --> 31:58.630
I, UH, CALLED IN
SOME FAVORS.

31:58.670 --> 32:00.945
IF YOU HAVEN'T NOTICED,
I'M VERY WELL CONNECTED.

32:00.980 --> 32:02.948
- TO...?

32:02.990 --> 32:05.436
- THE SECURITY GUARD.
HE OWES ME A FAVOR.

32:05.470 --> 32:08.155
- OOH.
SPARKLING WATER.

32:08.200 --> 32:09.508
- SO HOW ABOUT WE TOAST?

32:09.540 --> 32:11.337
- OKAY.

32:11.370 --> 32:13.543
- TO FIRST DATES.

32:13.580 --> 32:15.024
- OKAY.

32:15.070 --> 32:16.230
[Stars' Undertow]

32:16.270 --> 32:19.137
- ALL THE WIND'S
AT YOUR EYES

32:19.170 --> 32:21.058
AT YOUR EYES,
AT YOUR EYES

32:21.110 --> 32:22.725
AT YOUR EYES
- THIS IS GOOD.

32:28.460 --> 32:31.668
BOTH TAKE YOU
TO THE FLOOR...

32:31.700 --> 32:34.589
- THANK YOU.

32:34.640 --> 32:36.221
- YOU'RE WELCOME.

32:36.260 --> 32:38.046
- TO THE FLOOR
- WHEN WILL IT STOP?

32:38.090 --> 32:42.299
WHEN WILL IT STOP?
WHEN WILL IT STOP?

32:42.330 --> 32:44.673
WHEN WILL IT STOP?

32:54.730 --> 32:56.516
- HOW WAS THE MOVIE?

32:56.560 --> 32:58.039
- HEY.

32:58.070 --> 33:00.527
UH, IT WAS GOOD.
IT WAS A LITTLE LONG.

33:00.560 --> 33:03.074
BUT MICHAEL CERA
WAS ADORABLE AS ALWAYS.

33:03.110 --> 33:06.386
[continues playing guitar]

33:06.430 --> 33:07.385
WHAT?

33:07.430 --> 33:10.467
- YOU STILL PLAY THAT CHORD
THAT FUNNY WAY.

33:10.500 --> 33:12.320
- I KNOW.

33:12.360 --> 33:13.804
DAD SHOWED ME HOW TO DO IT,

33:13.850 --> 33:16.296
AND NOW IT'S THE ONLY WAY
I CAN PLAY IT.

33:16.330 --> 33:18.082
- NO, I REMEMBER.

33:18.130 --> 33:19.643
YOU WERE SO LITTLE
WHEN YOU STARTED PLAYING,

33:19.680 --> 33:24.379
AND YOUR LITTLE, TINY
LITTLE HAND WOULDN'T REACH.

33:26.790 --> 33:29.099
- YEAH, AND NOW I GET
MADE FUN OF.

33:29.140 --> 33:32.246
- WELL, SOMETHING USEFUL
HE TAUGHT YOU, ANYWAY.

33:32.280 --> 33:35.169
- YEAH.

33:35.220 --> 33:38.178
- I'M SORRY YOU'RE NOT DOING
THE OPEN-MIC NIGHT.

33:38.220 --> 33:41.109
I FEEL BAD ABOUT THAT.

33:43.400 --> 33:46.153
YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU HAVE KIDS,

33:46.190 --> 33:48.055
IF YOU HAVE KIDS,

33:48.090 --> 33:51.196
THERE'S SOMETHING
YOU SHOULD KNOW--

33:51.230 --> 33:55.121
A VERY CONFUSING THING
THEY DON'T TELL YOU.

33:55.170 --> 33:59.163
YOU SEE SO MUCH
OF YOURSELF IN THEM.

33:59.200 --> 34:02.089
YOU SEE...

34:02.140 --> 34:04.233
YOUR...

34:04.280 --> 34:07.101
IRONIC TAKE ON THE WORLD.

34:07.140 --> 34:08.584
- THAT ONE WAS FOR ME.

34:08.630 --> 34:11.246
- YOU SEE YOUR SMILE,
YOUR WALK,

34:11.290 --> 34:13.758
YOUR SENSE OF HUMOR,
WHATEVER.

34:13.810 --> 34:16.074
AND YOU THINK...

34:16.120 --> 34:19.214
THEY'RE YOU.

34:19.260 --> 34:22.878
BUT THEY'RE NOT YOU.

34:22.920 --> 34:26.879
AND THEY SHOULDN'T HAVE
ALL OF YOUR BAGGAGE,

34:26.920 --> 34:29.195
YOUR FEAR,
AND YOUR INSECURITY,

34:29.230 --> 34:32.199
AND YOUR LIFE EXPERIENCE,
BECAUSE THAT'S NOT FAIR.

34:32.240 --> 34:35.824
THEY HAVE THEIR OWN.

34:35.860 --> 34:39.444
YOUR SONG IS BEAUTIFUL.

34:39.490 --> 34:41.867
IT'S HAUNTING AND MOVING,

34:41.900 --> 34:45.904
AND...

34:45.940 --> 34:47.862
IT'S SO YOU.

34:47.910 --> 34:52.802
AND THAT'S ALL I SHOULD'VE SAID
TO YOU THE OTHER NIGHT.

34:52.840 --> 34:55.115
I'M SO PROUD,
AND I'M SO IMPRESSED,

34:55.160 --> 34:58.254
AND I'M SO...

34:58.300 --> 35:01.269
IN AWE OF YOU.

35:03.820 --> 35:07.756
AND I WANT YOU TO JUST
GO OUT THERE AND...

35:07.790 --> 35:09.712
FLY.

35:11.520 --> 35:14.375
YOU CAN FLY.

35:25.640 --> 35:28.211
- HEY, GUYS, GUYS, CAN I HAVE
EVERYONE'S ATTENTION?

35:28.260 --> 35:30.399
I HAVE A HUGE SURPRISE
FOR YOU.

35:30.430 --> 35:32.182
[children shouting]

35:32.230 --> 35:33.606
OKAY, HOLD ON. HOLD ON.
HOLD ON.

35:33.640 --> 35:36.814
OUR MOST TALENTED DIRECTOR
IS BACK FROM VACATION.

35:36.850 --> 35:40.263
YOU MAY REMEMBER HIM--
SYDNEY'S DAD, JOEL!

35:40.310 --> 35:44.588
[cheers and applause]

35:46.970 --> 35:49.416
- HI, DADDY.
- HEY, HONEY.

35:49.450 --> 35:52.658
WHO WANTS TO HELP US
TELL A STORY?

35:52.700 --> 35:55.726
SIT ON YOUR TUSHIES
IF YOU CAN HEAR ME.

35:55.770 --> 36:00.423
NOW, WE'RE GONNA NEED
TWO SUPER-SPECIAL VOLUNTEERS

36:00.460 --> 36:05.227
TO HELP US PASS OUT
A NEW SCRIPT

36:05.260 --> 36:07.876
FEATURING ALL THE MUSIC
THAT CROSBY TAUGHT YOU--

36:07.920 --> 36:12.198
ALL THAT GREAT MUSIC
WITH SOME HISTORY OF CALIFORNIA.

36:12.230 --> 36:14.369
IT IS GONNA BE AWESOME.

36:14.410 --> 36:16.401
WHISPER-SCREAM
AS LOUD AS YOU CAN.

36:16.450 --> 36:17.610
[whispering]
YEAH.

36:17.650 --> 36:20.756
[whispered screams]

36:32.250 --> 36:34.354
- WE'RE--WE'RE JUST SUPPOSED
TO WAIT?

36:34.390 --> 36:39.293
- YEAH. WE'LL JUST WAIT.
IT'S FINE.

36:39.330 --> 36:41.707
- YOU KNOW, MAYBE SOMEONE
SHOULD CHECK ON HER.

36:41.750 --> 36:43.911
- UH, THAT WOULD BE YOU.
- I'M SURE SHE'S FINE.

36:43.960 --> 36:45.404
I DON'T WANT TO SAY
THE WRONG THING AND--

36:45.440 --> 36:48.500
- SARAH, COME ON,
THIS IS RI-GOSH-DAB-DICULOUS.

36:48.550 --> 36:49.574
- OH, NO, NO, NO.
DAD, NO.

36:49.620 --> 36:51.576
- I GOT THIS HANDLED, BABY.

36:51.620 --> 36:53.895
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?
- OH, GOD.

36:53.930 --> 36:55.477
- WELL...

36:55.520 --> 36:57.238
[knock at door]

36:57.280 --> 36:59.965
- AMBER, I'M COMING IN.

37:00.010 --> 37:01.341
OKAY, LET'S GO.

37:01.390 --> 37:04.245
- I DON'T THINK
I CAN DO IT.

37:04.290 --> 37:07.248
I'M SO NERVOUS, AND MY VOICE
IS SOUNDING REALLY BAD.

37:07.290 --> 37:09.008
AND MY FINGERS FEEL HEAW.

37:09.050 --> 37:10.733
I'M SERIOUS.
I'M REALLY NERVOUS.

37:10.780 --> 37:12.919
- AMBER, STOP IT.
STOP IT. STOP IT.

37:12.950 --> 37:16.738
WE ARE GOING.

37:16.780 --> 37:19.431
HONEY...

37:19.470 --> 37:23.474
YOU ARE GONNA BE FANTASTIC.

37:25.310 --> 37:27.619
I MEAN GREAT.

37:37.560 --> 37:39.937
- YOU'RE AN E.V.P.
AT A SOLID COMPANY.

37:39.980 --> 37:43.279
I-I'VE GOT PEOPLE WHO'D KILL
FOR THAT JOB.

37:43.330 --> 37:47.016
- YEAH, UH, LOOK, IT'S JUST
THERE'S A CHANGEOVER GOING ON

37:47.050 --> 37:48.085
AT THE COMPANY,

37:48.120 --> 37:50.600
AND I'M NOT--I'M NOT SURE
IT'S GONNA CONTINUE

37:50.640 --> 37:51.777
TO BE A GOOD FIT.

37:51.820 --> 37:54.050
SO I JUST WANTED TO SEE,
YOU KNOW,
