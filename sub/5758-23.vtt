00:01.830 --> 00:02.796
<i>Previously on Pretty Little Liars....</i>

00:02.797 --> 00:04.165
What happened in the woods?

00:04.166 --> 00:05.600
Toby Cavanaugh is dead.

00:05.601 --> 00:08.568
Somebody killed him. I saw his body.

00:08.570 --> 00:10.037
Ahh! Oh, God.

00:10.038 --> 00:11.771
Maggie, I am so sorry.

00:11.772 --> 00:13.906
Did pastor Ted hire somebody
to work on the church?

00:13.907 --> 00:15.808
Hannah: I put a five dollar bill
in the church collection box,

00:15.809 --> 00:17.511
it had some dice drawn on it.

00:17.512 --> 00:19.179
And later that day, Caleb's dad had it.

00:19.180 --> 00:20.480
Do you really think he
would steal from the place

00:20.481 --> 00:21.648
that just hired him?

00:21.649 --> 00:23.650
There was some trouble with the old badges.

00:23.651 --> 00:25.785
People getting in? People getting out?

00:25.786 --> 00:28.254
Ezra Fitz has applied
as a substitute teacher.

00:28.255 --> 00:31.124
I have to ask, are you seeing Ezra Fitz?

00:31.125 --> 00:31.991
No, I'm not.

00:34.194 --> 00:36.595
All I want from you and
your mother is that car.

00:36.596 --> 00:39.165
Look at all that's happened
since you turned me down

00:39.166 --> 00:41.300
on our little drive up the mountain.

00:41.301 --> 00:43.835
But I believe in second
chances. You need me.

00:48.474 --> 00:49.808
(Door buzzing)

00:54.346 --> 00:56.782
You have visitors.

00:56.783 --> 00:58.383
Spencer?

00:59.851 --> 01:01.385
I'll be in the hall if you need me.

01:11.262 --> 01:14.131
Emily: Hey. You knew we were coming, right?

01:14.132 --> 01:17.000
We spoke with your mom. We
wanted to be here the first day.

01:17.001 --> 01:19.035
But she said you were going
to be home tomorrow, so...

01:19.036 --> 01:20.536
She still believes that?

01:22.073 --> 01:23.707
She thinks that I'll be able
to sleep through the night

01:23.708 --> 01:27.443
if I just take a nice bubble
bath and lay in my own bed?

01:28.913 --> 01:32.181
- I think what she wants is...
- I know what she wants, but

01:32.182 --> 01:35.184
they don't make a loofa that
scrapes out the inside of your head.

01:40.123 --> 01:42.357
The park rangers found a body.

01:42.358 --> 01:44.026
Emily and Aria: Hannah! What?

01:44.027 --> 01:46.228
The sooner she knows, the sooner
she checks out of this place.

01:47.996 --> 01:52.266
What Hannah is trying to
say is we have good news.

01:52.267 --> 01:54.769
They found a body in the woods.

01:54.770 --> 01:56.871
The police believe it was a camper.

01:57.973 --> 02:00.174
It was Toby.

02:00.175 --> 02:04.377
No, Spence, it wasn't.

02:04.378 --> 02:06.913
This person, he'd been missing for awhile

02:06.914 --> 02:08.749
and he was nowhere near
where you thought you saw...

02:08.750 --> 02:10.917
I know what I saw.

02:10.918 --> 02:12.719
It was Toby.

02:18.025 --> 02:20.960
Hey, so, um, I was thinking tomorrow night

02:20.961 --> 02:22.628
when you get home, we could all...

02:22.629 --> 02:24.830
I need to stay here. I need more time.

02:24.831 --> 02:26.198
Time for what?

02:26.199 --> 02:27.432
Hannah.

02:27.433 --> 02:28.801
Shuffling around in Mona's old slippers

02:28.802 --> 02:30.269
isn't going to get her any better.

02:30.270 --> 02:31.237
Hannah, chill.

02:31.238 --> 02:32.304
You know what...

02:32.305 --> 02:34.106
I would not dine here, if I were you,

02:34.107 --> 02:35.907
I had to sneak around in that kitchen,

02:35.908 --> 02:38.276
and I saw a roach big
enough to wear an apron.

02:38.277 --> 02:39.911
Moving. On.

02:39.912 --> 02:42.680
You are not crazy. This place is.

02:42.681 --> 02:45.283
I'm too tired to have
this fight right now, guys.

02:49.655 --> 02:51.789
I feel safe here.

02:51.790 --> 02:54.825
Those bars don't just
keep you from getting out,

02:54.826 --> 02:57.694
they keep other people from getting in.

03:09.907 --> 03:11.774
(Knocking on door) Uh, need a minute.

03:13.510 --> 03:16.813
Your friends are leaving.
Do you want to say good-bye?

03:16.814 --> 03:18.080
I already did.

03:33.863 --> 03:35.797
♪ got a secret, can you keep it ♪

03:35.798 --> 03:38.266
♪ swear this one you'll save ♪

03:38.267 --> 03:40.701

03:56.683 --> 03:58.017
Hannah: Have you seen my make-up bag?

03:58.018 --> 03:59.485
(Sighs) No, but I think everything

03:59.486 --> 04:00.920
that was in it is on my pillow.

04:00.921 --> 04:02.889
Okay, don't start. I only slept for,

04:02.890 --> 04:04.257
like, 20 minutes.

04:04.258 --> 04:05.291
Emily: Why do you keep looking out there?

04:05.292 --> 04:07.327
Because Wilden knows I'm staying here.

04:07.328 --> 04:08.828
That's what you're thinking about?

04:08.829 --> 04:10.396
I'm having dreams about our
friend having her head shaved,

04:10.397 --> 04:11.663
and you're looking...

04:11.664 --> 04:12.697
I have lots of other
things that are keeping me

04:12.698 --> 04:14.499
up at night, okay Emily?

04:14.500 --> 04:17.069
If that car I dunked suddenly
learns how to float, then...

04:17.070 --> 04:18.070
If Wilden's looking for his car,

04:18.071 --> 04:19.271
then he's not "A."

04:19.272 --> 04:21.072
Okay, besides cars
don't float, if they did,

04:21.074 --> 04:22.174
pilgrims could have driven here.

04:22.175 --> 04:23.608
Why is there a wet towel on my bed?

04:23.609 --> 04:24.642
(Knock on door)

04:24.643 --> 04:25.978
Pam: Ladies, you better get hopping,

04:25.979 --> 04:27.478
or you're not going to
have time for breakfast.

04:27.479 --> 04:30.248
Hannah: Oh, none for me, thanks.

04:30.249 --> 04:32.583
You know I love her, but
somebody's got to teach

04:32.584 --> 04:35.519
that girl the word "fold."

04:35.520 --> 04:36.988
It was a rough night.

04:36.989 --> 04:39.490
Honey, look. I know it's
hard seeing a friend suffer,

04:39.491 --> 04:41.058
but if the doctors think she...

04:41.059 --> 04:42.693
Doctors aren't helping Spencer.

04:42.694 --> 04:44.494
Okay, she still believes that was Toby.

04:44.495 --> 04:46.562
Well, you can't get caught
up in that kind of thinking.

04:46.563 --> 04:48.698
Don't take on a tragedy that
has nothing to do with you.

04:48.699 --> 04:50.733
Mom! Okay, you work at the precinct,

04:50.734 --> 04:52.769
can you at least tell me when
you know more about the body?

04:52.770 --> 04:55.338
(Sighs) Look,

04:55.339 --> 04:58.275
if it'll help you move on from this,

04:58.276 --> 05:00.376
then yes.

05:00.377 --> 05:03.212
You'll know when I know.

05:11.121 --> 05:13.755
Sure if this is big enough to split?

05:13.756 --> 05:16.791
I think that we should go sit inside.

05:16.792 --> 05:17.926
We could also eat this in my car

05:17.927 --> 05:19.693
and duck every time somebody walks by.

05:19.694 --> 05:21.262
If I'm telling the principal
that we're not involved,

05:21.263 --> 05:22.964
I don't think we should be seen splitting

05:22.965 --> 05:24.665
- a cruller on the sidewalk.
- All right,

05:24.666 --> 05:26.100
we're not going backwards.

05:26.101 --> 05:27.535
We'll figure it out.

05:27.536 --> 05:30.338
Look...

05:30.339 --> 05:32.740
Nothing between us needs to change.

05:32.741 --> 05:34.909
(Phone ringing)

05:36.511 --> 05:37.511
It's Maggie.

05:39.347 --> 05:41.315
Hey, what's up?

05:41.316 --> 05:43.150
What time?

05:44.820 --> 05:49.355
Tomorrow... um, no, I just have a...

05:49.356 --> 05:55.294
You know what, yeah. I can pick him up.

05:55.295 --> 05:56.930
Yep.

05:56.931 --> 05:58.197
What's going on?

05:58.198 --> 05:59.966
Malcolm's karate class
gets out at the same time

05:59.967 --> 06:02.836
as my second interview.

06:02.837 --> 06:06.772
Well, I'd offer to help, I just figured

06:06.773 --> 06:09.007
after the whole
falling-off-the-bed incident...

06:09.008 --> 06:11.009
Well, you know I don't blame you for that.

06:11.010 --> 06:13.779
It's not about me.

06:13.780 --> 06:15.981
- So, Maggie blames me.
- You know what,

06:15.982 --> 06:18.283
honestly, I would love it
if you picked up Malcolm.

06:18.284 --> 06:20.085
If I put off this interview,

06:20.086 --> 06:22.153
someone else is going to get that job.

06:22.154 --> 06:23.254
(Laughs)

06:23.255 --> 06:25.156
Well, what are you going to tell Maggie?

06:25.157 --> 06:27.192
I can deal with her.

06:30.096 --> 06:32.230
And what's even trippier
is we both have scars

06:32.231 --> 06:34.499
below our left knee.
And, you know, granted,

06:34.500 --> 06:37.201
my dad got his in prison, but...

06:37.202 --> 06:38.635
That was a joke.

06:38.636 --> 06:40.137
(Laughs)

06:41.606 --> 06:44.475
Mmm, what's that smell? New perfume?

06:44.476 --> 06:46.410
No, it's air freshener.

06:46.411 --> 06:48.412
Emily's mom sprayed it all
over my clothes and then,

06:48.413 --> 06:51.215
when I wasn't looking,
she sprayed it in my hair.

06:51.216 --> 06:52.415
Ask her to spritz you tonight.

06:52.416 --> 06:54.850
My dad wants to take us to a nice dinner.

06:54.851 --> 06:58.654
Caleb, he does not have to do that.

06:58.655 --> 07:01.391
Stop.

07:01.392 --> 07:02.892
Look, not only are you the person that

07:02.893 --> 07:05.428
brought him back into my life,

07:05.429 --> 07:07.563
but you're the reason
he gets to stay in it.

07:08.899 --> 07:11.233
And you got the man work.

07:11.234 --> 07:13.002
Let him get you an entrée.

07:29.484 --> 07:33.220
Can't you just ask your mom for
a copy of the coroner's report?

07:33.221 --> 07:34.789
Aria, the report doesn't say not Toby,

07:34.790 --> 07:36.257
it says John Doe.

07:36.258 --> 07:38.826
It's not going to change Spencer's mind.

07:38.827 --> 07:41.428
(Phone rings)

07:43.297 --> 07:45.032
Who's that?

07:45.033 --> 07:46.667
Um, Shana.

07:46.668 --> 07:48.835
Why does she keep texting you
while Paige is out of town?

07:48.836 --> 07:49.870
Is she into you?

07:51.105 --> 07:53.273
Sorry you guys, Caleb had a lot to share.

07:53.274 --> 07:54.274
Why are you blushing?

07:54.275 --> 07:55.976
Why is she blushing?

07:55.977 --> 07:58.277
Shana's cruising her, and I
think that she should shut it down

07:58.278 --> 07:59.946
<i>before it turns into ex and the city.</i>

07:59.947 --> 08:01.781
Guys, I'm not thinking about Shana.

08:01.782 --> 08:03.182
We need to help Spencer.

08:03.183 --> 08:04.816
No, Em, you saw her face.

08:04.817 --> 08:07.351
She's not getting out of
there unless we kidnap her.

08:07.352 --> 08:10.288
Or we actually take the body there
and prove to her it isn't Toby.

08:13.025 --> 08:15.259
Em, that's not a real option.

08:15.260 --> 08:18.429
No, but, taking a picture of it is.

08:18.430 --> 08:19.898
And we've been to that morgue before,

08:19.899 --> 08:22.032
what's stopping us from going back?

08:22.033 --> 08:25.469
Um, do we really have to answer that?

08:27.238 --> 08:30.007
Eddie: Ever played this one?

08:30.008 --> 08:34.211
Um, no. Looks like it's
a bit before my time.

08:34.212 --> 08:36.013
So is Duke Ellington.
If he walks in the door,

08:36.014 --> 08:38.280
are you going to ask him
not to play the piano?

08:38.280 --> 08:40.783
Wren: Spencer? I just
learned you're admitted.

08:40.784 --> 08:42.719
I didn't know.

08:42.720 --> 08:45.021
Eddie, uh, could you check on Mr. Paterson?

08:45.022 --> 08:47.156
He may need assistance
getting to physical therapy.

08:47.157 --> 08:48.424
He had it this morning.

08:48.425 --> 08:49.692
Then, perhaps you could do a follow-up,

08:49.693 --> 08:51.293
check on his pain management.

09:01.104 --> 09:02.804
How're you feeling?

09:02.805 --> 09:03.972
Um...

09:06.976 --> 09:09.610
Spencer, if there's anything
I said or did that...

09:09.611 --> 09:11.712
No, you're not the reason that I'm here.

09:13.181 --> 09:15.716
Who chose this game? You or Eddie?

09:15.717 --> 09:16.851
Eddie. Why?

09:18.620 --> 09:21.822
He played it with Mona,
when she first arrived.

09:21.823 --> 09:23.323
Yeah, she was a bit obsessed with it,

09:23.324 --> 09:25.859
until she eventually traded it for cards.

09:25.860 --> 09:28.728
(Phone ringing)

09:28.729 --> 09:30.063
I'm afraid I've got to push on.

09:30.064 --> 09:31.665
I'll check on you later.

09:32.767 --> 09:35.401
Okay.

09:51.818 --> 09:53.118
I'll see you later.

09:53.119 --> 09:54.053
Hannah?

09:56.089 --> 09:58.690
I've left your mom several
messages and I haven't heard back.

09:58.691 --> 10:01.492
Is there a better way that I can reach her?

10:01.493 --> 10:03.961
Uh, she's in New York right
now for a training seminar.

10:03.962 --> 10:06.731
Why, what's wrong?

10:06.732 --> 10:10.768
We just need her to weigh
in on a delicate issue.

10:10.769 --> 10:12.003
Who's we?

10:15.840 --> 10:17.908
Mrs. Montgomery, what's going on?

10:17.909 --> 10:19.676
(Sighs)

10:19.677 --> 10:21.812
I'm on the church's restoration committee,

10:21.813 --> 10:23.747
and something's come up.

10:23.748 --> 10:26.049
Wait, is this about Caleb's dad?

10:26.050 --> 10:28.751
(Sighs)

10:28.752 --> 10:31.854
How well did your mom know
Jamie before she recommended him?

10:33.990 --> 10:35.825
Look, I'm trying to help.

10:35.826 --> 10:37.492
It's just, it's really
hard to defend the honor

10:37.493 --> 10:39.228
of someone you don't even know.

10:39.229 --> 10:42.732
I'm hoping it's all just
a big misunderstanding.

10:42.733 --> 10:44.566
And what's the misunderstanding?

10:46.102 --> 10:50.004
Jamie... removed the
bronze bell from the tower

10:50.005 --> 10:52.240
to have it repaired, but the one that was

10:52.241 --> 10:56.244
returned is evidently of much lesser value.

10:56.245 --> 10:58.312
Wait, that's what this is about?

10:58.313 --> 11:00.648
They miss their old, crusty bell?

11:00.649 --> 11:03.450
To the tune of $8,000.

11:05.586 --> 11:06.854
Please, don't say anything to Caleb,

11:06.855 --> 11:09.422
just have your mom call me.

12:37.749 --> 12:39.716
It's got great bones.

12:39.717 --> 12:41.484
They built these churches to last.

12:41.485 --> 12:43.486
When do they expect you to be done?

12:43.487 --> 12:45.021
I'm going to take my time.

12:45.022 --> 12:46.622
I want to get this right.

12:48.525 --> 12:51.160
Oh, before I forget.

12:57.333 --> 12:58.801
What is this?

12:58.802 --> 12:59.702
It's for you.

13:01.370 --> 13:02.470
Open it.

13:06.842 --> 13:07.842
It's an angel.

13:07.843 --> 13:09.210
It seemed appropriate.

13:10.980 --> 13:12.047
I don't know what to say.

13:12.048 --> 13:13.414
(Phone ringing)

13:13.415 --> 13:16.084
Oh, I hate these damn things.

13:16.085 --> 13:17.718
Let me turn this off.

13:20.154 --> 13:22.723
Actually, it's Pastor Ted.

13:22.724 --> 13:24.191
I may have to get this, excuse me.

13:26.895 --> 13:28.062
Hello?

13:31.066 --> 13:33.499
Veronica: I thought this
might make you feel better.

13:33.500 --> 13:35.001
And then maybe on the
way home, we can stop...

13:35.002 --> 13:38.404
- I'm not coming home. 
- Just at least put on the blouse.

13:38.405 --> 13:41.474
Mom, I told you I'm not ready.

13:41.475 --> 13:43.409
Well, as soon as you're
in your own bedroom,

13:43.410 --> 13:44.543
- surrounded by your... 
- Look, mom,

13:44.544 --> 13:46.980
I can't just go back
to dinners at the club.

13:46.981 --> 13:48.947
You don't have to wear the
blazer, just put on the...

13:48.948 --> 13:50.248
(Yelling) I said I'm not ready!

14:14.773 --> 14:17.207
What happened between you and Toby?

14:19.678 --> 14:24.313
I'm not moving from this spot
until I get a real answer.

14:27.151 --> 14:30.485
The last time I saw someone in this state,

14:30.486 --> 14:32.955
clinging to a secret
this hard, it was Alison.

14:36.059 --> 14:37.860
A few weeks later she was dead.

14:42.799 --> 14:44.699
(Door opens)

14:44.700 --> 14:46.968
(Sighs) Alison.

14:48.904 --> 14:50.237
Where were you? I thought you were

14:50.238 --> 14:51.338
asleep in Spencer's room.

14:52.574 --> 14:55.242
I had to go out.

14:55.243 --> 14:56.243
For what?

14:58.213 --> 15:00.714
What happened to your mouth? It's bleeding.

15:00.715 --> 15:04.184
I must've scratched myself on a tree branch

15:04.185 --> 15:05.952
on my way over to the house.

15:05.953 --> 15:08.088
Can I go upstairs, please?

15:08.089 --> 15:10.223
Why did you have to go to your
house at three in the morning?

15:10.224 --> 15:14.227
Mrs. Hastings, please.
I can't talk about this.

15:14.228 --> 15:16.696
Let me get some ice for
your mouth. Just stay there.

15:16.697 --> 15:18.097
Please?

15:24.337 --> 15:25.470
Here.

15:26.940 --> 15:29.675
Did you have a fight with someone?

15:29.676 --> 15:33.144
Mrs. Hastings, if you tell my parents,

15:33.145 --> 15:34.446
it's only going to make it worse.

15:36.516 --> 15:38.917
Promise me you won't say anything.

15:43.723 --> 15:45.123
Come here.

15:49.761 --> 15:51.529
Shh.

15:54.566 --> 15:56.300
I'm just being weird.

15:57.902 --> 16:00.738
Overly sensitive. I'm fine.

16:08.212 --> 16:10.413
You never told this to the police?

16:10.414 --> 16:11.948
Of course I did.

16:14.885 --> 16:17.520
But I made up my own mind about
who went after her that night

16:17.521 --> 16:19.188
and I kept that to myself.

16:19.189 --> 16:20.356
Well, who?

16:20.357 --> 16:22.725
Why? Mom, how could you not say anything?

16:22.726 --> 16:24.793
Because if Jason went after us,

16:24.794 --> 16:27.829
exposing your father as his, too,

16:27.830 --> 16:30.566
it'd be my family breaking
down in the middle of the night.

16:33.303 --> 16:35.471
So, you still believe Jason?

16:35.472 --> 16:37.739
No, I don't. Not anymore.

16:38.907 --> 16:41.142
But I'm starting to wonder about others.

16:45.080 --> 16:46.581
I need to ask.

16:48.317 --> 16:51.486
Is Toby not the person
that we thought he was?

17:04.064 --> 17:06.599
Sorry, guys, I'm going
to have to hit the road.

17:06.601 --> 17:08.768
There's a problem at
work I gotta deal with.

17:08.769 --> 17:09.769
What, right now?

17:09.770 --> 17:11.936
I've just been fired.

17:11.938 --> 17:14.006
What... what are you talking about?

17:14.007 --> 17:17.910
It seems the wrong bell
got hung up in the tower...

17:17.911 --> 17:20.979
I'm gonna have to go down to the
foundry myself and clear this up.

17:20.980 --> 17:22.247
Do you want me to come with you?

17:22.248 --> 17:24.215
No, you guys finish your dinner,

17:24.217 --> 17:26.584
I'll sort this out. I'll see you later.

17:33.359 --> 17:34.826
(Door closing)

18:09.526 --> 18:11.894
Okay, who am I supposed
to text if I see someone?

18:11.895 --> 18:13.362
Me. Not Hannah.

18:13.363 --> 18:15.664
We're using her phone to take the picture.

18:15.665 --> 18:17.532
Hannah, pay attention.

18:17.533 --> 18:19.835
What? I'm sorry.

18:19.836 --> 18:22.303
My boyfriend's dad got nailed for stealing.

18:22.304 --> 18:24.539
Where do you sell a hot bell, anyway?

18:24.540 --> 18:25.507
Hannah, focus. I don't want to be

18:25.508 --> 18:27.175
in there any longer than we have to.

18:27.176 --> 18:30.210
We find John Doe, we take the
picture, and we get out of here.

18:30.211 --> 18:32.312
If it's bronze, you
probably melt it down first.

18:32.313 --> 18:33.781
Melt it into what?

18:33.782 --> 18:35.115
Why are we still discussing bells?

18:35.116 --> 18:37.585
Because Caleb thinks his dad is a Saint,

18:37.586 --> 18:40.120
and I know he's selling
pieces of our church online.

18:40.121 --> 18:41.722
Okay, forget it. I'll do this alone.

18:52.533 --> 18:55.234
Hannah: How are we gonna
know which one is John Doe?

18:55.235 --> 18:56.870
Emily: We have to go through those racks.

18:56.871 --> 18:59.472
Um, no. You are going through those racks.

18:59.473 --> 19:02.674
This isn't a clearance sale,
Emily, and I'm freaking out.

19:02.675 --> 19:04.143
All we've done is walk through those doors.

19:04.144 --> 19:07.313
It doesn't matter! I smell dead people.

19:09.516 --> 19:12.318
Fine, just get your phone ready, okay?

19:13.987 --> 19:16.222
I'll hold it, but you have to aim it.

19:16.223 --> 19:18.857
I just want to close my eyes.

19:31.003 --> 19:32.838
Hannah: God, this is so wrong.

19:32.839 --> 19:36.140
You spend your whole life doing crunches,

19:36.141 --> 19:41.211
getting rid of tan lines, not
eating that second pudding.

19:42.848 --> 19:44.582
And then in the end you're
just a stale loaf of bread

19:44.583 --> 19:46.451
lying on a rack.

19:46.452 --> 19:47.885
Um, maybe you can help me with this loaf,

19:47.886 --> 19:49.519
- I can't find the tag.
- Wait.

19:51.288 --> 19:53.056
Em, what if it really is Toby in there?

19:53.057 --> 19:57.160
It's not. And Spencer needs to know that.

19:58.563 --> 19:59.863
Okay, but just in case
I don't know if I can

19:59.864 --> 20:02.766
handle seeing his face.
So can we just look for

20:02.767 --> 20:05.468
his tattoo or something?

20:05.469 --> 20:06.769
It's not Toby.

20:16.980 --> 20:18.280
(Cell phone beeps)

20:25.220 --> 20:26.721
(Door closes)

20:30.926 --> 20:32.660
(Elevator bell dings)

20:41.636 --> 20:43.036
Emily: Ahh!

20:49.443 --> 20:51.845
(Cell phone rings)

20:51.846 --> 20:53.079
Em, someone's coming.

20:53.080 --> 20:54.113
Come on, we have to go.

20:55.415 --> 20:57.149
Em, come on!

21:05.205 --> 21:06.639
(Knocking on door)

21:06.640 --> 21:07.873
Hi, sunshine.

21:07.874 --> 21:09.774
Hey.

21:09.775 --> 21:11.443
Good book?

21:11.444 --> 21:12.911
It's okay.

21:12.912 --> 21:15.647
Can I ask you something?

21:15.648 --> 21:18.350
That game that you
wanted to play yesterday?

21:18.351 --> 21:21.386
I heard it was one of Mona's favorites.

21:21.387 --> 21:23.655
Who played it with her?

21:23.656 --> 21:25.156
I don't recall.

21:25.157 --> 21:27.358
Mona liked to play a lot of games.

21:27.359 --> 21:28.859
Yeah, but Wren...

21:28.860 --> 21:31.162
Dr. Kingston, he said she was

21:31.163 --> 21:32.463
"obsessed" with this one.

21:33.531 --> 21:34.798
Well, he would know.

21:36.134 --> 21:37.768
What is with you and him?

21:37.769 --> 21:40.971
What do you mean?

21:40.972 --> 21:45.775
Eddie, are you the
person behind the trouble

21:45.776 --> 21:47.443
with the visitors' passes?

21:47.444 --> 21:48.978
Did you let somebody in who...

21:48.979 --> 21:51.447
It wasn't me.

21:51.448 --> 21:52.614
Was it Dr. Kingston?

21:55.051 --> 21:56.852
Take your pill.

21:56.853 --> 21:57.953
You may be sleeping, but you don't look

21:57.954 --> 21:59.021
like you're getting any rest.

21:59.022 --> 22:00.489
I won't tell anybody.

22:00.490 --> 22:04.825
Trust your instinct. Mine told me,

22:04.826 --> 22:06.294
from the minute that guy got here,

22:06.295 --> 22:07.661
it wasn't for the right reasons.

22:09.631 --> 22:11.499
Let's just leave it at that, okay?

23:09.187 --> 23:11.055
Hey.

23:11.056 --> 23:12.789
Did you get my messages?

23:12.790 --> 23:14.124
Yeah, I've been cramming for algebra.

23:14.125 --> 23:16.060
I have a make-up test
in, like, ten minutes.

23:16.061 --> 23:17.694
Well, my dad's screwed.

23:17.695 --> 23:19.496
The foundry claims there is no mix-up,

23:19.497 --> 23:21.765
and they have the paper trail to prove it.

23:21.766 --> 23:23.999
Well, maybe if your father
spoke to the church committee,

23:24.000 --> 23:26.335
and told them that... told them what?

23:26.336 --> 23:28.071
Why should he have to
defend himself to a bunch of

23:28.072 --> 23:30.273
small-minded people who
think someone is a thief

23:30.274 --> 23:32.175
just because they don't
tuck in their shirt?

23:35.245 --> 23:37.447
Did I press mute or something?

23:37.448 --> 23:38.447
Why are you being so quiet?

23:39.515 --> 23:41.683
I'm just listening.

23:41.684 --> 23:43.418
You did a lot of that last night, too.

23:45.321 --> 23:48.223
I don't know what to say, Caleb.

23:48.224 --> 23:50.692
Since when? Hannah you
have an opinion about

23:50.693 --> 23:52.894
everything, from honey boo-boo's hair cut

23:52.895 --> 23:55.196
to the weird look the
lunch lady gave you when

23:55.197 --> 23:56.897
you asked for butter on your corn.

23:56.898 --> 23:58.732
Look, I just don't think that

23:58.733 --> 24:00.568
your dad has changed as much

24:00.569 --> 24:02.203
as much as you think he has.

24:08.009 --> 24:09.876
Look, the night that he
got the job at the church,

24:09.877 --> 24:12.745
I put money in the church collection box,

24:12.746 --> 24:16.716
and when he paid for the
pizza, he used that same bill.

24:18.685 --> 24:20.253
How could you possibly know that?

24:20.254 --> 24:24.257
Because there was a pair
of lucky dice drawn on it.

24:24.258 --> 24:25.725
It was the same bill, Caleb.

24:30.230 --> 24:32.697
(School bell rings)

24:36.002 --> 24:38.837
(Scattered chattering)

24:42.541 --> 24:45.876
Hi. Excuse me, yeah, I'm
here to pick up Malcolm.

24:45.877 --> 24:48.312
Oh, he was already picked
up about ten minutes ago.

24:48.313 --> 24:50.881
He was? Oh, so Maggie must have...

24:50.882 --> 24:53.151
Oh, no, his mom didn't
come today, it was a friend.

24:53.152 --> 24:55.586
Uh, Aria Montgomery.

24:57.322 --> 24:58.788
Something wrong?

24:58.789 --> 25:01.491
No. No, everything's fine, thanks.

25:17.274 --> 25:19.941
(Carnival music playing)

25:19.942 --> 25:21.877
(Children laughing)

25:24.681 --> 25:27.216
(Laughing)

25:42.808 --> 25:46.311
Carnival barker: Knock
them down and win a prize!

25:46.312 --> 25:48.880
(Carnival barker continues)

25:55.786 --> 25:57.621
(Laughter)

25:57.622 --> 25:59.689
Ella: Aria?

25:59.690 --> 26:01.892
I didn't know you were coming here tonight.

26:01.893 --> 26:04.594
Yeah, I'm came to meet
up with Ezra and Malcolm.

26:04.595 --> 26:06.296
Are you all right?

26:06.297 --> 26:08.197
Is Maggie here, too?

26:08.198 --> 26:09.132
I don't know, maybe.

26:09.133 --> 26:10.433
Honey, we talked about this.

26:10.434 --> 26:12.435
And I know you want to make it work, but...

26:12.436 --> 26:15.038
- Okay, mom, I can't do this right now.
- Aria!

26:15.039 --> 26:16.906
You're going to be the one that gets hurt.

26:16.907 --> 26:19.575
Not to mention a confused
little boy who's still wondering

26:19.576 --> 26:21.977
how this stranger is suddenly his father.

26:21.978 --> 26:24.746
He needs help working
through it, but not with you.

26:24.747 --> 26:27.449
Malcolm already has
somebody looking out for him.

26:27.450 --> 26:29.684
I have to go.

26:48.903 --> 26:52.039
Be right back, I'm going to
drop this off to room 217.

26:52.040 --> 26:54.975
What is that?

26:54.976 --> 26:56.310
A book.

26:56.311 --> 26:58.211
One of the patients was
asking for it earlier, so...

26:58.212 --> 26:59.412
Yes, well, our patient needs her rest.

26:59.413 --> 27:01.081
You can give it to Spencer tomorrow.

27:03.284 --> 27:04.851
I'm off tomorrow.

27:04.852 --> 27:06.252
All right, then I'll
give it to her for you.

27:09.256 --> 27:13.893
We're not having the same
problem again, are we, Eddie?

27:13.894 --> 27:17.129
(Fair music playing)

27:34.780 --> 27:36.514
Have you heard anything yet?

27:36.515 --> 27:37.983
Nope. (Phone rings)

27:37.984 --> 27:39.651
For all I know, he's already skipped town.

27:39.652 --> 27:40.719
Well, I spoke to my mom...

27:40.720 --> 27:42.821
Hannah, it's not up to your mom

27:42.822 --> 27:46.123
or you, or me to dig him out of this.

27:46.124 --> 27:47.758
Is this everything?

27:47.759 --> 27:49.760
Yeah, almost. Just to find my English book.

27:49.761 --> 27:51.495
All right, I'll be out front.

27:53.498 --> 27:56.466
(Door bell rings)

27:58.503 --> 28:00.004
Jamie: Hey.

28:00.005 --> 28:02.338
I was on my way to your place,
and I saw your car out front.

28:02.339 --> 28:03.740
Where were you?

28:03.741 --> 28:06.342
Oh, making phone calls... hey.

28:06.343 --> 28:07.644
Was trying to track
down a guy who helped me

28:07.645 --> 28:10.847
with the dry wall. And
see if he can help...

28:10.848 --> 28:13.482
Help with what? Back up your story?

28:13.483 --> 28:14.416
What's his cut?

28:15.853 --> 28:17.185
What?

28:17.186 --> 28:19.254
Caleb, don't do this right now.

28:19.255 --> 28:20.255
Hey, you should listen to your girlfriend.

28:20.256 --> 28:21.690
I am.

28:21.691 --> 28:23.692
And I believe her when she
says this isn't the first time

28:23.693 --> 28:25.160
that you've stolen from that church.

28:25.161 --> 28:26.928
What are we talking about here?

28:26.929 --> 28:29.765
We aren't talking. We are done.

28:29.766 --> 28:31.667
Last night, you were my defender.

28:31.668 --> 28:33.467
- What happened?
- I woke up,

28:33.468 --> 28:36.270
and I realized that this isn't the
first time that you've screwed me over.

28:36.271 --> 28:38.205
Oh, I see.

28:38.206 --> 28:40.606
I'm still that person, huh?

28:40.607 --> 28:42.542
Somehow you managed to
forgive your mother's sins.

28:42.543 --> 28:45.178
Don't suppose it's got anything
to do with that fancy car

28:45.179 --> 28:46.312
she tossed at you.

28:46.313 --> 28:48.782
That has nothing to do with this.

28:48.783 --> 28:52.218
Maybe not, but it's got to
be easier to point a finger

28:52.219 --> 28:56.055
at someone with a rusty pick-up
and no permanent address.

28:56.056 --> 28:57.422
Isn't that all the proof you needed?

28:59.859 --> 29:02.027
All the proof that I needed
were the ratty hand-me-downs

29:02.028 --> 29:03.195
that I had as a kid.

29:03.196 --> 29:05.664
Remember the winter coat
that ended at my elbow?

29:05.665 --> 29:07.465
And the unsigned permission slips?

29:07.466 --> 29:10.135
And the social workers,
and the foster families

29:10.136 --> 29:13.271
who slammed doors in my face when
they were tired of looking at me?

29:13.272 --> 29:15.006
That is my proof!

29:19.212 --> 29:22.146
Yeah.

29:22.147 --> 29:26.150
Wow, when you put it that way...

29:26.151 --> 29:28.419
I guess I wouldn't believe me, either.

29:38.162 --> 29:39.396
<i>Aria: Should I call the police?</i>

29:39.397 --> 29:40.897
<i>Emily: Yes. Wait.</i>

29:40.898 --> 29:42.499
<i>Unless you think it will make it worse.</i>

29:42.500 --> 29:45.167
What's worse? "A's" got Ezra's kid.

29:45.168 --> 29:47.503
<i>I'm just saying, you saw
them, Malcolm wasn't hurt.</i>

29:47.504 --> 29:49.239
<i>But if you call the cops, "A" might...</i>

29:49.240 --> 29:50.640
Don't. Just don't.

29:50.641 --> 29:52.609
Okay, I swear, if something
happens to that little boy

29:52.610 --> 29:54.176
because of me, I don't
know what I'm going to do.

29:54.177 --> 29:56.312
<i>Aria. Walk over to the police station,</i>

29:56.313 --> 29:58.615
<i>and report it. I'll meet you there in ten.</i>

30:00.050 --> 30:01.183
(Sighs)

30:24.444 --> 30:25.911
Malcolm?

30:25.912 --> 30:29.214
There's gonna be another
show. The man outside said so.

30:29.215 --> 30:30.649
I'm early.

30:41.594 --> 30:44.328
You know, I was supposed to pick
you up from your karate class, right?

30:44.329 --> 30:46.531
But your friend picked me up instead.

30:46.532 --> 30:48.332
She said her name was Alison.

30:53.838 --> 30:54.738
Come on, we should go.

30:56.107 --> 30:57.641
Your dad's probably wondering where we are.

31:15.714 --> 31:17.782
(Phone ringing)

31:19.011 --> 31:21.183
_

31:22.154 --> 31:24.055
Emily?

31:24.056 --> 31:27.158
Um, mom, I figured you'd be home by now.

31:27.159 --> 31:29.427
I thought I was clear this morning.

31:29.428 --> 31:31.595
Look, I know you want answers,
but you can't be doing this.

31:33.798 --> 31:36.267
Go home. We'll talk about this later.

31:36.268 --> 31:38.169
What's going on?

31:38.170 --> 31:39.136
This is not the time.

31:39.137 --> 31:40.171
Why are they making you stay late?

31:40.172 --> 31:41.939
Emily, go.

31:41.940 --> 31:44.441
I'll call you when I'm on my way.

32:11.301 --> 32:14.803
One, two, three, four...

32:33.121 --> 32:35.522
(Humming coming from the distance)

32:44.565 --> 32:47.167
(Humming continues)

32:58.345 --> 33:01.280
(Humming getting louder)

33:11.023 --> 33:12.890
Didn't your mother have this?

33:14.326 --> 33:15.493
Your mother.

33:15.494 --> 33:17.962
Really, I must have left it at your house

33:17.963 --> 33:19.564
and didn't get it back.

33:19.565 --> 33:22.266
I left a lot of stuff there.

33:22.267 --> 33:25.902
Is it just me, or was sixth
grade the best year ever?

33:27.505 --> 33:29.173
I didn't even know you then.

33:29.174 --> 33:30.274
Oh, honey,

33:30.275 --> 33:32.776
you didn't even know me when you knew me.

33:34.078 --> 33:36.479
(Music starts playing)

33:38.248 --> 33:40.149
Come on, give it up, Spence.

33:40.150 --> 33:41.250
Let's pretend that you're getting ready for

33:41.251 --> 33:43.752
your first boy-girl dance party.

33:47.057 --> 33:48.991
No one ever tells you that the practice

33:48.992 --> 33:51.427
is so much more fun than the real thing.

33:52.495 --> 33:55.197
Spencer: Was it Toby?

33:55.198 --> 33:59.467
Was he the one that
gave you that bloody lip?

33:59.468 --> 34:01.903
Toby?

34:01.904 --> 34:03.938
Oh, sweetie,

34:03.939 --> 34:06.441
girls fight much dirtier than boys.

34:08.077 --> 34:10.811
I'm lucky she didn't leave a scar.

34:10.812 --> 34:14.981
She? Who?

34:14.982 --> 34:16.750
You stopped dancing.

34:16.751 --> 34:18.619
I don't... I don't want to dance.

34:18.620 --> 34:20.053
I'll change the song.

34:20.054 --> 34:23.324
No, I can't. I haven't slept in three days.

34:23.324 --> 34:26.693
Come on. I'm looking for something.

34:26.694 --> 34:29.295
The star on Mona's game board.

34:29.295 --> 34:32.398
Oh, that. It's in there.

34:36.069 --> 34:39.339
♪

35:19.009 --> 35:20.877
Wren: Spencer.

35:20.878 --> 35:22.411
What are you doing?

35:25.816 --> 35:27.750
♪

35:46.502 --> 35:48.970
So...

35:49.771 --> 35:52.206
You're Malcolm's new hero.

35:52.207 --> 35:54.108
He had a blast tonight.

35:56.611 --> 35:57.778
What did he say?

35:57.779 --> 36:00.314
Ah, not much. Maggie said he

36:00.315 --> 36:02.549
mumbled something about puppets,

36:02.550 --> 36:04.351
and then fell right to sleep.

36:05.787 --> 36:07.453
Huh.

36:07.454 --> 36:11.390
Oh, she asked me to pass along her thanks.

36:11.391 --> 36:12.758
You know, if you keep
spoiling him like this,

36:12.759 --> 36:14.861
he's not going to want
to go with anyone else.

36:14.862 --> 36:15.929
Ezra?

36:17.164 --> 36:20.099
I don't think that I can do this anymore.

36:20.100 --> 36:22.734
Aria, I was kidding. You won't have to.

36:22.735 --> 36:28.673
<i>No, I'm saying I don't think
that I can do this anymore.</i>

36:31.510 --> 36:34.046
What? What do you mean?

36:34.047 --> 36:35.480
It isn't just the two of us now,

36:35.481 --> 36:37.415
and eventually somebody's
going to wind up hurt.

36:39.451 --> 36:41.452
And I'd rather it be me.

36:42.921 --> 36:44.989
I just need to go home.

36:44.990 --> 36:48.559
- Now? Okay, well then, just
let me get a waitress... - No.

36:48.560 --> 36:52.263
You finish, I'm...

36:52.264 --> 36:54.364
I'm going to walk. I think that
the air will be good for me.

36:54.365 --> 36:57.868
Hey. I've had these days.

36:57.869 --> 37:00.636
I promise you things will
look different in the morning.

37:24.794 --> 37:27.496
Spencer: How many times did she visit her?

37:27.497 --> 37:29.163
What is that?

37:29.164 --> 37:31.433
Mona kept souvenirs.

37:31.434 --> 37:33.167
How many times did Cece visit her?

37:33.168 --> 37:36.671
- I wouldn't know.
- Yes, you would, Wren.

37:36.672 --> 37:38.774
You authorized it.

37:38.775 --> 37:40.509
And I was almost suspended for it.

37:40.510 --> 37:44.211
Mona was under restriction
at that time, no visitors.

37:44.212 --> 37:46.747
And you broke the rules for her because...?

37:53.922 --> 37:57.758
Cece called me and was
desperate to see her.

37:57.759 --> 37:58.925
She thought she could help her.

37:58.926 --> 38:00.927
Help her with what?

38:00.928 --> 38:02.061
Recover from the psychic
wounds inflicted by your

38:02.062 --> 38:03.596
late friend, Alison.

38:03.597 --> 38:04.831
You sure it wasn't the other way around?

38:04.832 --> 38:07.099
Quite sure. Alison pulled
some stunt at a frat party

38:07.100 --> 38:09.035
that got Cece kicked out of university.

38:10.971 --> 38:14.273
Ali... got Cece kicked out of school?

38:14.274 --> 38:15.741
Yeah, Cece came out the other side,

38:15.742 --> 38:19.378
and she thought she could
serve as a role model for Mona.

38:19.379 --> 38:21.513
And I agreed.

38:21.514 --> 38:23.816
How did she even know
that Mona was even in here?

38:25.518 --> 38:27.353
Melissa called her.

38:30.290 --> 38:31.489
(Knock on door)

38:31.490 --> 38:35.360
Emily? Is Hannah home?

38:35.361 --> 38:37.662
No. She's out with Caleb, why?

38:40.066 --> 38:41.366
Mom?

38:41.367 --> 38:43.301
What's going on?

38:43.302 --> 38:45.736
Why were you carrying
that missing persons file?

38:47.472 --> 38:50.640
I promised I wouldn't
keep anything from you.

38:50.641 --> 38:54.178
But I have to make sure that
you keep this from your friends.

38:55.780 --> 38:57.014
Can I have your phone, please?

38:58.383 --> 38:59.450
What?

38:59.451 --> 39:00.884
This is very sensitive information,

39:00.885 --> 39:02.919
- if it got out before the police...
- Mom.

39:02.920 --> 39:04.520
Please, what is it?

39:08.792 --> 39:11.394
They found another body early this evening.

39:13.530 --> 39:15.731
A young man.

39:15.732 --> 39:18.301
Late teens, early 20s.

39:18.302 --> 39:19.767
No identification.

39:21.804 --> 39:24.539
What are you saying?

39:24.540 --> 39:26.508
It could be Toby?

39:26.509 --> 39:28.377
I don't know.

39:28.378 --> 39:30.512
How can they not know?

39:30.513 --> 39:33.548
There was significant
trauma to the body, Emily.

39:35.850 --> 39:38.552
It's gonna take some time
before they're certain.

39:40.922 --> 39:43.124
We'll know more tomorrow morning.

40:11.839 --> 40:13.740
Do you want to take a walk or something?

40:17.045 --> 40:19.413
It was stupid.

40:19.414 --> 40:22.349
You gave someone a second chance.

40:22.350 --> 40:24.251
That's never stupid.

40:24.252 --> 40:28.354
We talked about this road
trip we were gonna take.

40:28.355 --> 40:30.156
Ride bikes, go out west.

40:30.157 --> 40:33.393
(Sighing)

40:33.394 --> 40:35.195
I was already mapping it out.

40:37.498 --> 40:39.632
We can take a trip sometime.

40:39.633 --> 40:43.469
- I know it's not the same,
but... - It would be better.

40:43.470 --> 40:46.138
Because I'll be with someone
who I know is looking out for me.

40:55.815 --> 40:58.049
I'll get us refills.

41:07.159 --> 41:09.427
(Bell tolling)

41:09.428 --> 41:11.562
(Phone ringing)

41:13.532 --> 41:15.698
(Bell continues tolling)

41:30.147 --> 41:35.984
So, basically "A" was framing
Jamie the whole time?

41:35.985 --> 41:37.853
Do you think that bill from
the collection box was...

41:37.854 --> 41:39.955
Don't you?

41:39.956 --> 41:42.591
Caleb is never going to forgive me.

41:42.592 --> 41:44.160
Where is he now?

41:44.161 --> 41:45.761
He went to go find Jamie.

41:45.762 --> 41:47.863
But even if he does, what
is he supposed to tell him?

41:47.864 --> 41:51.366
He may just have to find a
way to tell him the truth.

41:52.601 --> 41:54.870
Caleb's familiar with the workings of "A."

41:54.871 --> 41:56.204
So is Ezra.

41:56.205 --> 41:57.639
Do you plan on telling
him who bought his kid

41:57.640 --> 41:59.941
a big, fat balloon today?

41:59.942 --> 42:01.643
(Knock on door)

42:03.145 --> 42:04.745
Aria: Em? It was the wrong body.

42:04.746 --> 42:05.813
Hannah: What?

42:05.814 --> 42:06.814
The John Doe, the one in the mask.

42:06.815 --> 42:08.115
It was the wrong one.

42:08.116 --> 42:09.550
Emily, you're not making sense.

42:09.551 --> 42:11.385
They just found a body tonight.

42:11.386 --> 42:12.753
In a shallow grave out in the woods.

42:12.754 --> 42:13.754
Where?

42:13.755 --> 42:15.389
Exactly where Spencer said it was.

42:15.390 --> 42:16.824
They found her purse close by.

42:56.562 --> 42:58.196
<i>Mona's voice: Look at
all that's happened since</i>

42:58.197 --> 43:01.565
<i>you turned me down on our
little drive up the mountain.</i>

43:01.566 --> 43:03.201
<i>But I believe in second chances.</i>

43:03.202 --> 43:05.136
<i>Spencer's voice: You don't
have to ask me again, Mona.</i>

43:05.137 --> 43:07.371
<i>I'm in.</i>
