00:01.834 --> 00:04.202
Sabrina, we have
good news and bad news.

00:04.203 --> 00:05.270
The bad news is

00:05.271 --> 00:06.737
we're going to a family reunion.

00:06.738 --> 00:07.839
The good news is--

00:07.840 --> 00:08.907
It's not our family?

00:08.908 --> 00:09.808
No.

00:09.809 --> 00:12.243
The family reunion
is in Hawaii.

00:12.244 --> 00:13.611
All right.
I wonder what

00:13.612 --> 00:15.213
the weather's like
in Hawaii right now.

00:15.214 --> 00:16.614
Well, let's see.

00:16.615 --> 00:19.551
( <i>tropical theme playing</i> )

00:19.552 --> 00:21.252
Okay, well, that
answers my question.

00:21.253 --> 00:22.787
I will not pack
galoshes.

Can I help you with

00:41.106 --> 00:43.074
those bags under your eyes?

00:47.045 --> 00:48.245
( cat meowing )

00:48.246 --> 00:49.347
Who's this?

00:49.348 --> 00:50.414
I'd like to
introduce you

00:50.415 --> 00:51.716
to my new
friend, Lola.

00:51.717 --> 00:53.918
I met her outside
my favorite sushi bar.

00:53.919 --> 00:56.354
We were fighting over
a tuna belly, and she won.

00:56.355 --> 00:58.055
( mockingly ):
Salem got beat by a girl.

00:58.056 --> 01:00.425
Salem got beat
by a woman, Sabrina.

01:00.426 --> 01:02.360
She's in the family way.

01:02.361 --> 01:04.696
Maybe we should
have him neutered.

01:04.697 --> 01:06.598
I heard that.
And for your information,

01:06.599 --> 01:07.665
I'm not the father.

01:07.666 --> 01:09.034
But she will be staying with us

01:09.035 --> 01:10.502
until the blessed event.

01:10.503 --> 01:12.770
Didn't I ask for milk?

01:13.940 --> 01:16.074
Harvey?
Harvey!

01:16.075 --> 01:18.042
Huh? I'm coming, Mom.

01:18.043 --> 01:20.311
Oh, man.
( laughter )

01:20.312 --> 01:21.880
Okay. Nothing to
see here.

01:21.881 --> 01:23.148
Show's over.

01:23.149 --> 01:25.149
Harvey, if you keep
falling asleep at your locker,

01:25.150 --> 01:27.618
they're gonna transfer you
to the narcolepsy magnet school.

01:27.619 --> 01:28.753
I know.

01:28.754 --> 01:30.788
My dad's away,
and according to my mom,

01:30.789 --> 01:32.490
pregnant women need
soy hot cocoas

01:32.491 --> 01:35.126
brought to them every half hour
throughout the night.

01:35.127 --> 01:37.996
Well, are you sure your mom's
pregnant and not just lazy?

01:37.997 --> 01:39.063
I need a break.

01:39.064 --> 01:40.965
Thinking about
joining the Army.

01:40.966 --> 01:42.434
Hey, I have an idea.
You need to get away,

01:42.435 --> 01:44.402
and we need someone to watch
Salem while we go on our

01:44.403 --> 01:46.204
family reunion to Hawaii.
I'll do it.

01:46.205 --> 01:47.539
I'll pay you.

01:47.540 --> 01:49.340
Great. Oh, wait.

01:49.341 --> 01:52.143
We have another cat,
and she's pregnant.

01:52.144 --> 01:54.679
Does she sit around and moan
about her varicose veins?

01:54.680 --> 01:57.348
Not so far.
When do I start?

01:57.349 --> 01:58.716
SALEM:
Harvey?

01:58.717 --> 02:00.184
You got a mortal
to stay with us?

02:00.185 --> 02:02.354
So, what if I need
something for Lola?

02:02.355 --> 02:03.588
How am I supposed
to let him know?

02:03.589 --> 02:06.424
Charades? Come-hither
stares?

02:06.425 --> 02:08.059
What if I put a Dr. Dolittle
spell on Harvey?

02:08.060 --> 02:09.693
That way you two
can talk to each other.

02:09.693 --> 02:11.296
You've done that spell
before?

02:11.297 --> 02:12.830
No, but I can.
I discovered it

02:12.831 --> 02:14.299
while studying the magic book.

02:14.300 --> 02:15.933
Studying the magic book?

02:15.934 --> 02:18.803
Who are you and what
have you done with Sabrina?

02:18.804 --> 02:20.639
Harvey, this is
Lola.

02:20.640 --> 02:22.707
She mostly just wants
to be left alone.

02:22.708 --> 02:25.309
An excellent quality
in a pregnant thing.

02:25.310 --> 02:27.579
Sabrina, we'd better
get going.

02:29.115 --> 02:32.583
Oh, I just wanted to make,
uh, Harvey a farewell drink.

02:32.584 --> 02:33.918
Uh, farewell.

02:35.587 --> 02:37.021
Dolittle spell?

02:37.022 --> 02:38.256
Ugh!

02:38.257 --> 02:39.758
Dolittle.

02:39.759 --> 02:41.091
I didn't know Kool-Aid

02:41.092 --> 02:42.794
came in chunky style.

02:42.795 --> 02:45.062
Oh, uh, Harvey, you remember
Salem, don't you?

02:45.063 --> 02:46.030
Hey, Harv.

02:46.031 --> 02:47.933
Hey, Salem. Anything on TV?

02:47.934 --> 02:49.667
<i>SportsCenter.</i>
You get the chips,

02:49.668 --> 02:50.901
I'll get the remote.

02:50.902 --> 02:51.769
You're on.

02:52.738 --> 02:54.238
Have a great time.

02:54.239 --> 02:56.307
Okay, well, uh...

02:56.308 --> 02:58.209
I hope we don't
miss our flight.

02:58.210 --> 02:59.310
I mean, it's rush hour.

02:59.311 --> 03:01.446
The highways will be jammed.

03:01.447 --> 03:02.513
I love that joke.

03:04.583 --> 03:05.883
( <i>tropical theme playing</i> )

03:07.653 --> 03:09.386
Wow. For the first time
in my life

03:09.387 --> 03:11.623
I understand the meaning
of the word "swank."

03:11.624 --> 03:12.990
Hold it.

03:12.991 --> 03:14.292
This is Hilda's
and my room.

03:14.293 --> 03:15.726
Your room is
through there.

03:15.727 --> 03:18.262
My own room?
What a great reunion.

03:18.263 --> 03:20.198
I don't care if I do have
to kiss Aunt Bootsie.

03:24.403 --> 03:26.203
I'm calling management.

03:26.204 --> 03:27.672
There's something
we need to tell you

03:27.673 --> 03:29.006
about this
trip, dear.

03:29.007 --> 03:30.474
You can't enjoy
the beach

03:30.475 --> 03:32.143
until you solve
the family secret.

03:32.144 --> 03:33.377
What?

03:33.378 --> 03:35.313
When were you planning on
telling me this?

03:35.314 --> 03:37.115
Now.

03:37.116 --> 03:38.449
Don't worry.
You'll solve it.

03:38.450 --> 03:40.819
It'll be easy once
you have the final clue.

03:42.754 --> 03:44.655
I am Pele,

03:44.656 --> 03:47.558
Hawaiian goddess of fire.

I am here to give you

03:52.531 --> 03:53.931
the final clue

03:53.932 --> 03:58.069
to the Spellman family secret.

03:58.070 --> 03:59.570
Oh! Oh! Oh.

03:59.571 --> 04:01.506
Would some baking soda help?

04:01.507 --> 04:02.774
That's okay. Just don't talk.

04:02.775 --> 04:04.475
It distracts me.

04:04.476 --> 04:07.545
Here is your clue.

04:07.546 --> 04:09.647
Is it on fire?

04:09.648 --> 04:10.482
No.

04:10.483 --> 04:12.350
I lost more clues that way.

04:13.385 --> 04:14.819
Here.

04:15.988 --> 04:17.120
Good luck.

04:19.257 --> 04:21.692
Huh. A ball of string.

04:21.692 --> 04:23.728
Okay, well, I'll just
call room service

04:23.729 --> 04:25.764
and, uh, ponder over this

04:25.765 --> 04:28.399
while I have a burger
and some free movies.

04:28.400 --> 04:29.600
Sorry. No food.
No fun.

04:30.636 --> 04:31.703
You have to work
on it

04:31.704 --> 04:33.337
until you get
the answer.

04:33.338 --> 04:34.339

he stitched himself up?

Stallone really did that.

You did your homework,
right?

Right. What homework?

05:11.109 --> 05:12.977
Oh. Hilda...

05:12.978 --> 05:14.712
at the last family
reunion,

05:14.713 --> 05:16.447
you managed to
alienate everyone

05:16.448 --> 05:18.749
because you hadn't even read
the family newsletter.

05:18.750 --> 05:20.384
Oh, it wasn't
that bad.

05:20.385 --> 05:22.520
They made you
eat sand.

05:22.521 --> 05:23.521
Not a lot.

05:23.522 --> 05:25.490
Mm, anyway, here comes
Uncle George.

05:25.491 --> 05:27.425
Now, he's at
the reunion

05:27.426 --> 05:28.993
with his second
wife, Ruby.

05:28.994 --> 05:31.663
I don't know what
he sees in her,

05:31.664 --> 05:33.064
but be sure to
compliment her

05:33.065 --> 05:35.166
on her supposed
weight loss.

You've lost weight.

they're towing my car.

I'll help you...

with the clue.

06:11.604 --> 06:12.937
What is this?
HARVEY: Salem?

06:14.039 --> 06:15.039
What did the doctor say?

06:15.040 --> 06:17.842
Oh. The doctor on the telephone,

06:17.843 --> 06:19.677
( meowing )
yeah, uh,
said Lola needs

06:19.678 --> 06:20.645
a nesting spot.

06:20.646 --> 06:21.946
Go get a cardboard box

06:21.947 --> 06:23.348
and set it up
in the living room.

06:23.349 --> 06:24.281
Run, man!
Okay.

06:24.282 --> 06:25.449
But leave Lola
in here.

06:25.450 --> 06:27.685
The box is supposed to be
a surprise.

06:28.654 --> 06:30.754
You're a very controlling vet.

06:33.492 --> 06:34.692
Good going.

06:34.693 --> 06:36.194
Okay. This is
my last clue,

06:36.195 --> 06:37.295
a ball of string.

06:37.296 --> 06:39.396
That's not string. It's twine.

Oh, please let me at it.

06:41.499 --> 06:42.967
HARVEY:
Mom, what are you doing here?

06:42.968 --> 06:44.501
Well, I was
taking a walk,

06:44.502 --> 06:47.471
and suddenly I got
very tired.

06:47.472 --> 06:48.439
That's Mrs. Kinkle.

06:48.440 --> 06:49.440
I gotta get out of here.

helped Lola.

I'll find out, Mom.

Got to go.

How do you get
all the sand out?

Ugh. Shell.

Hm.

of alcoholics?

No.

the Spellman family

07:31.783 --> 07:35.019

a twine.

07:35.020 --> 07:37.588
Minus the "e" is "twin."

That's it!

Every member of the Spellman
family is born with a twin!

07:42.161 --> 07:44.095
A twin?

07:44.096 --> 07:46.097
Congratulations, Sabrina.

07:46.098 --> 07:47.332
You solved
the family secret.

Come here.

I'd like to introduce you
to your twin...

07:54.473 --> 07:56.473
Hello, Sabrina.
Wow. I'm so excited.

07:56.474 --> 07:59.944
And, apparently, not unique.

08:05.618 --> 08:07.185
I can't believe
I have a twin.

08:07.186 --> 08:09.053
This is really good news,
especially if one of us

08:09.054 --> 08:10.421
ever needs a kidney.

08:10.422 --> 08:12.056
Katrina lives in South Dakota

08:12.057 --> 08:14.525
in a house exactly like ours.

08:14.526 --> 08:16.361
Except for some reason,
they have shag.

08:17.462 --> 08:18.896
( <i>upbeat rock theme playing</i> )

08:54.766 --> 08:57.034
Katrina and I had a great time
together yesterday.

08:57.035 --> 08:58.670
It's weird we don't have
the same parents.

08:58.671 --> 09:00.605
Are your twins as nice as mine?

09:00.606 --> 09:03.173
Actually, our twins
turned out to be evil.

09:03.174 --> 09:05.443
Which brings us to
another teeny thing

09:05.444 --> 09:06.577
we have to tell you.

09:06.578 --> 09:08.379
Zelda.

09:08.380 --> 09:10.347
Sit down, dear.

09:10.348 --> 09:12.784
You see, in all
witch twins,

09:12.785 --> 09:14.185
one twin is evil,

09:14.186 --> 09:15.953
and the other one is good.

09:15.954 --> 09:19.323
And, unfortunately,
the evil twin is not allowed

09:19.324 --> 09:20.892
to live in the Mortal Realm.

09:20.893 --> 09:23.494
Oh, no. Katrina can't be
the evil one.

09:23.495 --> 09:25.763
Wait a minute. That would mean
I'm the evil one.

09:25.764 --> 09:28.199
She did leave the pool boy
a crummy tip.

09:28.200 --> 09:29.300
I got this scar wrestling

09:29.301 --> 09:30.902
a monkey at
the county fair.

09:30.903 --> 09:32.336
Sweet.

09:32.337 --> 09:33.438
But I got you beat.

09:33.439 --> 09:35.840
Check out the one on my butt.

09:35.841 --> 09:37.708
I don't see a scar.

09:37.709 --> 09:39.376
Don't have one,
but made you look.

09:40.845 --> 09:43.013
MRS. KINKLE:
Oh, fiddlesticks.

09:45.017 --> 09:47.017
Mom, what are you doing?

09:47.018 --> 09:49.654
I'm trying to get into
Lola's nesting box,

09:49.655 --> 09:51.922
but I think I need
a bigger one.

09:53.458 --> 09:55.192
Order on
the beach!

09:55.193 --> 09:58.629
In today's case
of <i>Katrina v. Sabrina,</i>

09:58.630 --> 10:00.231
the tribunal shall decide

10:00.232 --> 10:02.833
which witch is
the good witch,

10:02.834 --> 10:06.337
and which witch
is the evil...witch.

10:06.338 --> 10:07.671
Stop biting
your nails.

10:07.672 --> 10:09.673
I will if you stop
twirling your hair.

10:09.674 --> 10:11.342
Question one:

10:11.343 --> 10:13.477
Sabrina.
( dog barks )

10:13.478 --> 10:14.912
Oh, hey, buddy.

10:14.913 --> 10:16.714
Where's your tag?
Are you lost?

10:16.715 --> 10:18.949
What do you want to be
when you grow up?

10:18.950 --> 10:20.318
Does this dog
belong to anyone?

10:20.319 --> 10:22.086
Sabrina, pay attention
to the question.

10:22.087 --> 10:23.087
Sorry. What'd you say?

10:23.088 --> 10:25.089
I can't repeat the question.

10:25.090 --> 10:28.058
Oh, then, um, yellow?

10:28.960 --> 10:30.261
Katrina...

10:30.262 --> 10:33.431
what do you want to be
when you grow up?

10:33.432 --> 10:35.399
Well, I like people and animals,

10:35.400 --> 10:37.134
so I'll either be
a social worker

10:37.135 --> 10:38.368
or a veterinarian.

10:38.369 --> 10:39.837
( all cheer, applaud )

10:39.838 --> 10:42.172
Wrong.

10:42.173 --> 10:44.808
Sabrina wins
the question portion.

10:44.809 --> 10:45.943
You see,

10:45.944 --> 10:48.445
good witch cares
more about living things

10:48.446 --> 10:50.614
than about winning points
for herself.

10:51.816 --> 10:52.850
Whoo-hoo.

10:52.851 --> 10:54.518
I hated those
trick questions.

10:54.519 --> 10:57.421
I'm so embarrassed.
I gave that round to Katrina.

10:57.422 --> 10:59.423
Now, we shall randomly review

10:59.424 --> 11:02.393
each witch's use of magic.

11:02.394 --> 11:03.428
Was it for good?

11:03.429 --> 11:05.796
Or was it for evil?

11:05.797 --> 11:08.132
Roll the videotape.

11:08.133 --> 11:10.168
( <i>upbeat theme playing</i> )

11:22.648 --> 11:24.381
Not her best magic.

11:24.382 --> 11:25.816
And who picked
that music?

11:25.817 --> 11:27.217
Dressing Harvey was good magic.

11:27.218 --> 11:28.953
He looked like
a total dork before.

11:28.954 --> 11:31.756
But I mean "dork"
in the best possible way.

11:31.757 --> 11:34.158
You didn't dress
Harvey to help him.

11:34.159 --> 11:36.561
You did it to win the contest.

11:36.562 --> 11:39.196
Dressing Harvey
was selfish!

11:39.197 --> 11:41.399
Worst Spellman family trait.

11:41.400 --> 11:44.135
Now we shall review
Katrina's use of magic.

11:44.136 --> 11:47.070
( <i>upbeat theme playing</i> )

12:13.865 --> 12:16.067
I knew I should have
learned to cook.

12:16.068 --> 12:18.569
Pies for the homeless.
How nutritious.

12:18.570 --> 12:19.670
I think those children

12:19.671 --> 12:22.139
were being read to
against their will.

12:22.140 --> 12:23.808
So far, Sabrina has won

12:23.809 --> 12:24.876
the q and a,

12:24.877 --> 12:28.378
and Katrina has won
the life review.

12:28.379 --> 12:30.447
But since this is
a close call,

12:30.448 --> 12:34.685
I have one more
question

12:34.686 --> 12:36.420
which could make it
or break it

12:36.421 --> 12:37.989
for either one of you.

12:37.990 --> 12:38.889
May the best witch win.

12:38.890 --> 12:40.191
Right back at you.

12:40.192 --> 12:41.859
I would like each girl

12:41.860 --> 12:43.294
to quickly tell
the tribunal

12:43.295 --> 12:45.196
how she used her magic for good

12:45.197 --> 12:48.298
in the last 24 hours.

12:48.299 --> 12:50.534
Oh, um, I, uh...

12:50.535 --> 12:53.170
made a pregnant animal
feel comfortable.

12:53.171 --> 12:54.238
Katrina?

12:54.239 --> 12:55.306
Anything?

12:55.307 --> 12:57.007
Well, I, um--

12:57.008 --> 13:00.111
I got us both dates.

13:00.112 --> 13:01.845
Court's adjourned.

13:01.846 --> 13:05.148
Last one to limbo
is a rotten egg.

13:05.149 --> 13:06.850
Great. I'm ahead.

13:06.851 --> 13:08.986
Maybe I'm not
the evil one after all.

13:08.987 --> 13:11.255
Oh! Oh,
this trial

13:11.256 --> 13:12.956
is getting on my nerves.

13:12.957 --> 13:14.825
I have a bigger headache
than Uncle Danny

13:14.826 --> 13:16.194
after he celebrates.

13:16.195 --> 13:17.829
Well, another night
of drinking.

13:17.830 --> 13:20.031
Hello, Zelda.

13:20.032 --> 13:22.099
Hello, Uncle Danny.

13:22.100 --> 13:24.502
Oh, there goes
my car again.

13:24.503 --> 13:26.570
I'm good. I know I am.

13:26.571 --> 13:28.105
Or am I?

13:28.106 --> 13:29.740
I wonder if there's
a competent therapist

13:29.741 --> 13:30.740
on this island.

13:30.741 --> 13:32.709
( phone rings )

13:32.710 --> 13:33.878
Hello?

13:33.879 --> 13:35.379
Sabrina, we need you here now.

13:35.380 --> 13:38.081
Harvey's mom's in labor
at the hospital.

13:38.082 --> 13:40.350
And you need me to offer
hearty congratulations?

13:40.351 --> 13:41.618
<i>No.</i>

13:41.619 --> 13:43.453
'Cause when the doctors
listened to her stomach,

13:43.454 --> 13:44.521
they heard a heartbeat

13:44.522 --> 13:47.024
and something
that sounds like purring.

13:47.025 --> 13:48.759
Oh, no.
Oh, yes.

13:48.760 --> 13:50.328
<i>Looks like "Inexact Spell"</i>

13:50.329 --> 13:52.162
Spellman has struck again.

13:52.163 --> 13:53.997
I'll meet you at the hospital.

13:53.998 --> 13:55.933
( spitting )
Sand goes down
better the second time,

13:55.934 --> 13:57.468
don't you think?

13:57.469 --> 14:00.203
I understand
your not stopping them,

14:00.204 --> 14:01.472
but did you have to scream out,

14:01.473 --> 14:03.507
"More, more, she can take it"?

14:03.508 --> 14:05.576
You think we should
check on Sabrina?

14:05.577 --> 14:06.844
Oh, no.

14:06.845 --> 14:08.212
No, let her relax.

14:08.213 --> 14:09.480
Look out. Coming through.

14:09.481 --> 14:11.648
Okay. I checked the magic book,
and I transferred

14:11.649 --> 14:13.984
Lola's discomfort onto
the nearest pregnant creature.

14:13.985 --> 14:15.052
Mrs. Kinkle.

14:15.053 --> 14:16.053
Exactly.

14:16.054 --> 14:17.154
She's about to have kittens,

14:17.155 --> 14:18.755
unless I get her
and Lola together,

14:18.756 --> 14:20.957
sprinkle them with water
and incant a spell.

14:20.958 --> 14:22.760
So do we give up now
or carry this charade

14:22.761 --> 14:24.295
a beat longer?

14:24.296 --> 14:25.395
( in deep voice ):
Excuse me,

14:25.396 --> 14:26.663
I'm looking for
Mrs. Kinkle.

14:26.664 --> 14:27.731
She's about to deliver.

14:27.732 --> 14:28.799
Then I guess she might be

14:28.800 --> 14:30.000
in the delivery room.

14:30.001 --> 14:32.069
No need to be
snotty.

14:32.070 --> 14:33.804
That was evil.
Don't tell the witch judge.

14:33.805 --> 14:35.005
( moaning )
Relax, Ma.

14:35.006 --> 14:36.507
They'll stick a needle
in your spine,

14:36.508 --> 14:37.775
and it'll be
all better.

14:37.776 --> 14:39.277
( heavy breathing, screams )

14:46.151 --> 14:47.284
Dr. Merchant...

14:47.285 --> 14:48.786
let's hear
the fetal heartbeat

14:48.787 --> 14:50.721
and the so-called purring.
( sighs )

14:51.957 --> 14:53.023
( gasps )

14:53.024 --> 14:54.224
Oh, my.

14:54.225 --> 14:55.626
Is this what I think it is?

14:55.627 --> 14:58.262
Yes. Barbecue sauce.

14:58.263 --> 15:01.232
We had ribs
for lunch, remember?

15:01.233 --> 15:04.001
Right. Let's go wash up.

15:04.002 --> 15:05.235
We'll be right back.

15:07.438 --> 15:10.173
Harvey, get me a Nutrageous bar.

15:10.174 --> 15:11.575
I'm on it, Ma.

15:12.644 --> 15:15.045
Uh, Mrs. Kinkle,
holding a kitty

15:15.046 --> 15:16.547
is the latest
relaxation technique

15:16.548 --> 15:18.281
to ease
contraction pains.

15:18.282 --> 15:21.218
I'd chew steel right now.

15:21.219 --> 15:23.653
Please make this work.

15:23.654 --> 15:26.423
Mom. They didn't have
Nutrageous

15:26.424 --> 15:28.592
in the vending machine.
I had to get crackers.

15:28.593 --> 15:30.194
( in deep voice ):
Try the one in the basement.

15:30.195 --> 15:31.528
And take the stairs.

15:31.529 --> 15:33.463
I'm on it.

15:33.464 --> 15:36.166
Well, this isn't
going smoothly.

15:36.167 --> 15:37.702
And here come the doctors.

15:37.703 --> 15:39.336
<i>Uh, there was a spell</i>
<i>that went wrong</i>

15:39.337 --> 15:42.439
<i>Put these kitties back</i>
<i>where they belong</i>

15:42.440 --> 15:44.775
All right. It's time
to deliver the baby.

15:44.776 --> 15:46.810
Doctor, do you really
think it's appropriate

15:46.811 --> 15:48.878
to bring animals
into the delivery room?

15:48.879 --> 15:51.448
Oh. You mean, Dr. Fluffy
from the HMO?

15:55.019 --> 15:58.322
Whew! I'm glad I was able to
fix that little glitch.

15:58.323 --> 16:00.191
Helping Lola's the magic
that's gonna tip me off

16:00.192 --> 16:01.658
into the good-witch
category.

16:01.659 --> 16:03.260
I hate to burst
your bubble,

16:03.261 --> 16:04.461
but didn't you help Lola

16:04.462 --> 16:06.330
just so I'd help you
with the clue?

16:06.331 --> 16:07.931
Oh, no. You're right.

16:07.932 --> 16:09.767
And that was selfish.
And being selfish

16:09.768 --> 16:11.635
is a Spellman's worst trait.

16:11.636 --> 16:12.803
I'm evil!

16:12.804 --> 16:13.737
And doomed.

16:13.738 --> 16:15.005
Do either of you

16:15.006 --> 16:16.407
have a candy bar on you?

16:16.408 --> 16:19.175
I can't find the basement.

16:19.176 --> 16:20.211
Sabrina?

16:20.212 --> 16:22.112
Hi, Harvey.

16:22.113 --> 16:24.382
Aren't you supposed
to be in Hawaii?

16:24.383 --> 16:25.849
Without a mustache?

16:25.850 --> 16:29.152
Oh, right. Uh, tail winds?

16:30.488 --> 16:32.589
Look, Harvey, there's something
I have to tell you.

16:32.590 --> 16:34.524
I probably won't be able
to see you anymore.

16:34.525 --> 16:35.892
Why?

16:35.893 --> 16:38.495
Because I won't be allowed
to live in...

16:38.496 --> 16:39.963
Westbridge.

16:39.964 --> 16:41.631
Uh, we're just so crazy
about Hawaii,

16:41.632 --> 16:42.967
we're moving there. Heh.

16:42.968 --> 16:45.302
Well, what am I gonna
do without you?

16:45.303 --> 16:47.471
Uh, Mr. Kinkle. Your mother's
asking for you.

16:47.472 --> 16:49.340
It turns out the purring
was just a glitch

16:49.341 --> 16:50.474
on the sonogram.

16:50.475 --> 16:53.176
Sabrina, I--

16:53.177 --> 16:54.277
MRS. KINKLE:
Harvey!

16:54.278 --> 16:56.346
Please don't go?

16:56.347 --> 16:57.781
I'll miss you.

16:57.782 --> 16:59.449
Me too.

17:03.454 --> 17:04.855
( sobbing ):
Me three.

17:04.856 --> 17:06.056
Oh, that reminds me.

17:06.057 --> 17:08.391
I have to get rid of
that Dr. Dolittle spell.

17:08.392 --> 17:09.727
Why? Just because you're evil

17:09.728 --> 17:11.095
doesn't mean
I shouldn't continue

17:11.096 --> 17:12.730
my friendship with Harvey.

17:12.731 --> 17:14.564
SABRINA:
Well, I'm a wreck.

17:14.565 --> 17:15.531
Oh, now, now, dear.

17:15.532 --> 17:17.901
Just because your spell
was selfish.

17:17.902 --> 17:19.803
And involved
civil disobedience.

17:19.804 --> 17:21.704
And was very messy,

17:21.705 --> 17:23.906
doesn't mean you're
the evil twin.

17:23.907 --> 17:25.876
( gavel bangs )
JUDGE: Order on the sand!

17:25.877 --> 17:29.947
Since Sabrina's helping-a-
pregnant-cat spell was selfish,

17:29.948 --> 17:33.717
involved civil disobedience
and was extremely messy,

17:33.718 --> 17:36.287
the evil twin is...

17:36.288 --> 17:38.288
<i>( drum roll )</i>

17:38.289 --> 17:40.891
Sabrina Spellman.

17:40.892 --> 17:42.526
( people gasp )
Great.

17:42.527 --> 17:45.395
I finally win something.

17:47.766 --> 17:49.099
Why are we
at a volcano?

17:49.100 --> 17:51.201
I thought I just couldn't live
in the Mortal Realm.

17:51.202 --> 17:52.536
Well, actually, dear,
you can't live

17:52.537 --> 17:54.538
in the Mortal Realm
or the Other Realm.

17:54.539 --> 17:55.973
HILDA:
We didn't want to worry you.

17:55.974 --> 17:58.075
And besides, I never
thought you'd turn out

17:58.076 --> 17:59.510
to be the evil one.

17:59.511 --> 18:01.878
Especially when you turned out
to be the good one.

18:01.879 --> 18:03.547
Well, it was nice
getting to know you.

18:03.548 --> 18:06.083
Good luck with the rest
of your future. Sorry.

18:06.084 --> 18:07.851
What does she mean by that?

18:07.852 --> 18:10.420
Evil twins are thrown
into the volcano.

18:12.123 --> 18:13.890
Oh, to prove that they're brave,

18:13.891 --> 18:15.225
and then they'll be
welcomed back

18:15.226 --> 18:16.727
into the bosom of their family?

18:16.728 --> 18:18.929
Not exactly. Zelda.

18:20.531 --> 18:21.564
You see, Sabrina,

18:21.565 --> 18:24.568
lava is the only
substance that can--

18:24.569 --> 18:26.971
Oh. I'm sorry.

18:26.972 --> 18:29.272
Lava is the only
substance

18:29.273 --> 18:30.941
that can destroy
a witch.

18:30.942 --> 18:32.743
Get me the ACLU.

18:32.744 --> 18:34.811
At this time,
the good twin

18:34.812 --> 18:36.647
shall push
the evil twin

18:36.648 --> 18:38.582
into the volcano.

18:38.583 --> 18:39.550
Okey-dokey.

18:40.585 --> 18:41.918
( screams )
( gasps )

18:41.919 --> 18:43.186
Oh, no!

18:43.187 --> 18:44.488
HILDA:
She didn't!

18:44.489 --> 18:46.156
Why did you push
Sabrina

18:46.157 --> 18:47.858
into the volcano?

18:47.859 --> 18:51.328
Because you
told me to. Duh.

18:51.329 --> 18:53.497
No good witches
ever had the heart

18:53.498 --> 18:55.566
to do away with
their evil twin.

18:55.567 --> 18:57.334
Although, one
Hilda Spellman

18:57.335 --> 18:58.569
did come
very close.

19:00.237 --> 19:03.907
This proves Katrina
is the evil twin.

19:04.975 --> 19:05.842
( cell phone rings )

19:05.843 --> 19:07.077
SABRINA:
<i>Great. With my luck,</i>

19:07.078 --> 19:08.579
<i>it's a telemarketer.</i>

19:08.580 --> 19:09.646
Yes?

19:09.647 --> 19:10.747
Good news.

19:10.748 --> 19:12.849
Mrs. Kinkle delivered
a healthy baby girl,

19:12.850 --> 19:15.051
and Lola had
five little kittens.

19:15.052 --> 19:17.287
Uh-huh.

19:17.288 --> 19:18.855
What's that loud noise
in the background?

19:18.856 --> 19:20.624
Oh, that would be hot,
molten lava.

19:20.625 --> 19:22.126
I'm gonna have to
get back to you.

19:22.127 --> 19:25.195
Sabrina, we've got
good news for a change!

19:25.196 --> 19:27.764
You're not
the evil twin!

19:27.765 --> 19:30.333
Now you tell me!

19:30.334 --> 19:31.435
( magic chime )

19:31.436 --> 19:32.836
Oh, man, have you
ever tried

19:32.837 --> 19:34.638
to wash volcanic ash
out of your hair?

19:34.639 --> 19:36.640
No. But I came
really close,

19:36.641 --> 19:37.808
as the witch judge
pointed out

19:37.809 --> 19:39.743
to practically everyone
in Hawaii.

19:39.744 --> 19:41.111
So, what happened
to Katrina?

19:41.112 --> 19:44.414
She was sent to live in the
Twin Cities in the Other Realm.

19:44.415 --> 19:47.317
That's where all the evil twins
go after the volcano test.

19:47.318 --> 19:49.186
I thought evil twins died.

19:49.187 --> 19:51.054
No one's actually ever thrown
to their death

19:51.055 --> 19:52.689
during the volcano test.

19:52.690 --> 19:53.991
Well, except for you.

19:53.992 --> 19:55.993
Well, we all have
our 15 minutes.

19:57.195 --> 19:58.195
Oh!

19:58.196 --> 19:59.596
( whimpers, coughs )

20:03.267 --> 20:05.402
Well...here it is.

20:05.403 --> 20:07.537
Your official witch's license.

20:09.007 --> 20:10.006
It will give you more power

20:10.007 --> 20:12.008
than you ever dreamed
possible.

20:12.009 --> 20:13.010
But be careful.

20:13.011 --> 20:14.444
It can also cause
more trouble

20:14.445 --> 20:15.845
than you ever
dreamed possible.

20:15.846 --> 20:17.714
Just ask Hilda.

20:17.715 --> 20:19.950
Not all tsunamis
are bad.

20:19.951 --> 20:21.351
ZELDA:
And now,

20:21.352 --> 20:23.887
we have one final
lesson for you.

20:24.923 --> 20:26.756
( <i>mellow luau theme playing</i> )

20:26.757 --> 20:29.859
Well, this seems a tad
anticlimactic now.

20:29.860 --> 20:31.795
Oh, your skirt's on fire.

20:41.439 --> 20:42.839
Their names are Groucho,

20:42.840 --> 20:45.976
Harpo, Chico, Zeppo
and Pepe.
( meowing )

20:45.977 --> 20:47.544
"Pepe"? What happened
to "Gummo"?

20:47.545 --> 20:49.746
Gummo was my father's name.
( knock at door )

20:51.048 --> 20:53.550
Hey. Chocolate cigars
to celebrate the birth

20:53.551 --> 20:55.586
of my new baby sister, Oona.

20:55.587 --> 20:57.320
Oona Kinkle. I hope
she's good-looking.

20:57.321 --> 20:59.156
Hey, I have a big favor
to ask you.

20:59.157 --> 21:00.857
Can I take Lola
and the kittens home?

21:00.858 --> 21:02.659
Oona stops crying
when there's meowing,

21:02.660 --> 21:04.194
but it's making me hoarse.

21:04.195 --> 21:05.495
They're all yours.

21:05.496 --> 21:06.462
Meow!

21:06.463 --> 21:08.064
Oh, but, uh,
can Salem come visit,

21:08.065 --> 21:10.100
uh, every other
weekend?

21:10.101 --> 21:12.636
Sure. That way we can watch
<i>RoboCop</i> together.

21:12.637 --> 21:14.304
Why did I say that?

21:14.305 --> 21:15.773
'Cause you're sleep-deprived.
Right.

21:15.774 --> 21:18.342
I better get home.
I'll come back for Lola.

21:18.343 --> 21:20.176
I'm so glad you're
not leaving after all.

21:20.177 --> 21:21.912
Me too.

21:24.048 --> 21:25.281
Are you okay?

21:25.282 --> 21:26.583
Sure. I-- I mean,

21:26.584 --> 21:28.385
we knew we couldn't keep them.
( door closes )

21:28.386 --> 21:29.319
I just--

21:29.320 --> 21:30.854
( sobbing )

21:30.855 --> 21:33.857
I'm feeling a little
postpartum.

21:33.858 --> 21:36.560
I could use
a vacation.

21:36.561 --> 21:37.493
How about Maui?

21:38.305 --> 21:44.766
