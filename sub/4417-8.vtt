00:01.418 --> 00:04.587
{\an5}MOLLY:
<i>I went to space</i>
<i>on a 13-month solo mission.</i>

00:04.671 --> 00:06.589
<i>I didn't come home alone.</i>

00:06.673 --> 00:09.801
<i>The child--</i>
<i>part human, part alien--</i>

00:09.884 --> 00:11.928
<i>was unlike anything</i>
<i>the world had ever seen.</i>

00:13.138 --> 00:14.431
<i>My other child is</i>
<i>a life-like android.</i>

00:14.514 --> 00:16.140
Mom?

00:16.224 --> 00:17.809
<i>He has become the prototype</i>

00:17.892 --> 00:19.269
<i>for a new breed</i>
<i>of thinking machines</i>

00:19.352 --> 00:21.187
<i>called Humanichs.</i>

00:21.271 --> 00:23.606
<i>These two extraordinary</i>
<i>new life-forms</i>

00:23.690 --> 00:25.942
<i>now hold the key</i>
<i>to Earth's future.</i>

00:26.025 --> 00:27.485
<i>But where does that leave us?</i>

00:27.569 --> 00:30.280
<i>Over 99% of all species</i>

00:30.363 --> 00:33.450
<i>that have every existed</i>
<i>have gone extinct.</i>

00:33.533 --> 00:36.870
<i>What if it's our time?</i>

00:38.830 --> 00:41.124
<i>Previously on</i> Extant...

00:41.207 --> 00:42.417
Run!

00:43.752 --> 00:45.420
MOLLY:
<i>Shepherd released that virus.</i>

00:45.503 --> 00:48.506
<i>A lot of the hybrids</i>
<i>have been exposed.</i>

00:48.590 --> 00:49.591
(coughing)

00:49.674 --> 00:52.093
<i>My son Ahdu is dying.</i>

00:52.177 --> 00:53.470
There are some

00:53.553 --> 00:57.098
you cannot trust.

00:57.182 --> 00:58.892
MOLLY:
<i>Ares.</i>

00:58.975 --> 01:00.769
AHDU:
<i>And... Terra.</i>

01:03.730 --> 01:04.647
Good night, Rabbit.

01:04.730 --> 01:06.649
Good night, Mom.

01:06.733 --> 01:08.276
You have obviously
done something

01:08.359 --> 01:09.986
<i>to his memories.</i>

01:10.069 --> 01:10.862
I was protecting him!

01:10.945 --> 01:12.197
There are good Humanichs,

01:12.280 --> 01:13.656
and there are
bad Humanichs.

01:13.740 --> 01:15.450
LUCY:
My upload is going into

01:15.533 --> 01:17.202
all of those Humanichs?
Lucky them.

01:17.285 --> 01:19.120
I never installed
Lucy's limiters.

01:19.204 --> 01:20.455
Do you realize what you've done?

01:20.538 --> 01:23.124
CHARLIE:
<i>Lucy is one of the bad ones.</i>

01:23.208 --> 01:24.417
Good-bye, Julie.

01:27.587 --> 01:28.838
What did I do?

01:28.922 --> 01:30.006
If I turn myself in,

01:30.089 --> 01:31.633
they'll release Kelsey.

01:31.716 --> 01:33.843
SHEPHERD:
<i>Where's Molly?</i>

01:33.927 --> 01:35.470
You killed her.

01:35.553 --> 01:36.387
(coughing)

01:36.471 --> 01:38.598
RICHTER:
<i>You exposed her to the virus.</i>

01:39.766 --> 01:41.976
You wanted me, Toby.

01:42.060 --> 01:43.394
You got me.

01:45.063 --> 01:47.106
{\an3}Oh, God, what have
I done to you?

01:51.778 --> 01:53.863
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

01:53.947 --> 01:56.825
NATE:
Get her core temp down.

01:56.908 --> 01:59.035
Up the RecMesc
for the pain.

01:59.118 --> 02:01.412
{\an3}I need samples,
full metabolic panel.

02:01.496 --> 02:03.540
I need to run the viral DNA

02:03.623 --> 02:05.834
{\an3}against the database.
What are we looking for?

02:05.917 --> 02:08.377
Oh, I don't know.
A woman's dying of a virus

02:08.461 --> 02:11.214
{\an3}she created; maybe we're
looking for a cure.

02:11.297 --> 02:13.091
FIONA: <i> Doesn't look as if</i>
<i>you have much time.</i>

02:13.174 --> 02:15.218
{\an3}I would steer the
conversation quickly

02:15.301 --> 02:16.594
{\an3}to the matter
at hand.

02:16.678 --> 02:18.805
{\an3}How many hybrids have
survived the virus,

02:18.888 --> 02:20.431
how many there are
around the world.

02:20.515 --> 02:22.684
Yes, Madam Secretary,
I know what we need.

02:22.767 --> 02:24.686
Then go get it.

02:27.021 --> 02:29.524
(door hissing open)

02:37.323 --> 02:39.868
(door hissing, latch clicks)

02:45.707 --> 02:48.751
{\an1}(quietly):
Sorry about all the...

02:48.835 --> 02:51.462
poking and prodding.

02:51.546 --> 02:55.592
You <i> should</i> study me.

02:55.675 --> 02:58.761
Learn from me.

02:58.845 --> 03:00.763
What I could've been.

03:00.847 --> 03:03.433
I need to ask you some
questions, you know,

03:03.516 --> 03:06.102
uh, 'cause, um...

03:06.185 --> 03:08.438
you're the only one
who can give me answers.

03:08.521 --> 03:10.982
I gave you an answer.

03:13.401 --> 03:16.321
They're not the enemy.

03:16.404 --> 03:18.656
I can't take that on faith,

03:18.740 --> 03:19.741
{\an1}Molly.

03:19.824 --> 03:21.868
So you steal John's work

03:21.951 --> 03:25.788
{\an3}to create an army
of Humanichs.

03:25.872 --> 03:30.752
Machines to hurt
living creatures.

03:30.835 --> 03:32.462
{\an1}Soldiers,

03:32.545 --> 03:33.796
to win a war.

03:33.880 --> 03:35.757
You want war.

03:35.840 --> 03:36.966
They want peace.

03:37.050 --> 03:40.637
{\an3}You're wasting
your time, Toby.

03:40.720 --> 03:45.808
The human race--
not worth saving.

03:45.892 --> 03:48.811
You don't mean that.

03:48.895 --> 03:50.688
{\an3}I don't
have time

03:50.772 --> 03:53.900
to say things that I don't mean.

03:58.905 --> 04:01.908
You killed John, didn't you?

04:04.327 --> 04:06.996
I swear to you,

04:07.080 --> 04:09.499
I had nothing to do
with John's death.

04:09.582 --> 04:10.959
You're gonna die

04:11.042 --> 04:12.502
one day, too,

04:12.585 --> 04:14.170
{\an3}Toby.

04:14.253 --> 04:15.505
You should try

04:15.588 --> 04:17.673
speaking the truth.

04:17.757 --> 04:19.968
Does the soul good.

04:22.053 --> 04:24.514
I need to know how many survived

04:24.597 --> 04:26.808
and where they went.

04:26.891 --> 04:29.769
You want answers?

04:31.437 --> 04:33.982
Well, first...

04:34.065 --> 04:37.026
there's something I want.

04:38.403 --> 04:39.612
FIONA:
<i>So...</i>

04:39.696 --> 04:41.739
I hear we have a problem.

04:41.823 --> 04:43.533
Lucy. Lucy is

04:43.616 --> 04:45.326
{\an3}the problem.
Care to elaborate?

04:45.410 --> 04:46.995
{\an1}She overheard
us talking about

04:47.078 --> 04:49.247
{\an3}potentially shutting her down,
and she attacked me.

04:50.790 --> 04:52.583
Well, you were talking
about shutting her down.

04:52.667 --> 04:54.711
It's both human

04:54.794 --> 04:56.838
and Humanich, is it not,
the will to survive?

04:56.921 --> 04:58.006
{\an3}A-All due respect,
I think

04:58.089 --> 04:59.632
you're missing the point, here.

04:59.716 --> 05:01.175
Lucy tried to kill
a human being.

05:01.259 --> 05:03.428
Not only does that go against
Humanich protocol,

05:03.511 --> 05:06.055
but it raises into question
the safety of any Humanichs

05:06.139 --> 05:07.765
with her operating system.

05:07.849 --> 05:09.684
It also begs the question
why you were talking about

05:09.767 --> 05:10.727
shutting her down
in the first place.

05:10.810 --> 05:12.603
{\an1}She was showing
indications

05:12.687 --> 05:14.397
{\an4}of a very defiant streak.
CHARLIE:
We wanted to nip it

05:14.480 --> 05:16.524
{\an3}in the bud.
Madame Secretary,

05:16.607 --> 05:18.401
I have two dozen operational
Humanichs, all on standby.

05:18.484 --> 05:19.694
I want your authorization

05:19.777 --> 05:21.404
{\an3}to shut them down
and to suspend

05:21.487 --> 05:22.864
activation for a thousand plus.

05:22.947 --> 05:23.781
Because they all have
Lucy's programming.

05:23.865 --> 05:26.075
Yes.

05:28.453 --> 05:30.079
No virus in the history
of the world

05:30.163 --> 05:32.040
has ever been 100% lethal.

05:32.123 --> 05:35.043
Did you know that?

05:35.126 --> 05:36.419
Humanichs are
the ultimate solution

05:36.502 --> 05:38.254
to the hybrid question.

05:38.337 --> 05:40.757
Yeah, well, what's your solution
to the Humanichs question?

05:40.840 --> 05:42.800
We have promised our allies

05:42.884 --> 05:44.260
Humanichs who will
be operational

05:44.343 --> 05:45.928
and available immediately.

05:46.012 --> 05:48.473
{\an1}The hybrid threat
cannot be contained

05:48.556 --> 05:49.807
without them.

05:49.891 --> 05:50.975
{\an1}Now, I'm not
a technical person,

05:51.059 --> 05:52.435
but your concerns

05:52.518 --> 05:54.937
sound like glitches
that can be fixed.

05:55.021 --> 05:57.774
So I suggest you fix them.

05:57.857 --> 05:59.484
Fast.

06:04.697 --> 06:06.074
(Charlie sighs)

06:06.157 --> 06:08.451
Okay. So now what
the hell do we do?

06:08.534 --> 06:10.203
{\an3}We get those limiters
put back on fast,

06:10.286 --> 06:11.454
{\an3}and download them into
all those other Humanichs

06:11.537 --> 06:13.164
{\an3}before they're
activated.

06:13.247 --> 06:14.665
{\an5}All right.
We can't screw
this up again.

06:14.749 --> 06:16.209
{\an3}SHEPHERD:
Ms. Gelineau.

06:16.292 --> 06:17.960
There's something
you need to know.

06:18.044 --> 06:19.295
We have Molly Woods

06:19.378 --> 06:20.963
{\an3}in custody.

06:21.047 --> 06:22.715
She's dying.

06:24.050 --> 06:25.510
What?

06:25.593 --> 06:28.012
Her final wish

06:28.096 --> 06:29.305
is to see Ethan.

06:29.388 --> 06:31.224
Dying of what?

06:33.226 --> 06:36.687
{\an3}NATE: We recovered the hybrid
bodies for research.

06:36.771 --> 06:39.440
{\an3}We're going to conduct
some tests.

06:57.166 --> 07:01.671
Ethan...

07:01.754 --> 07:04.966
I'm leaving you this video log

07:05.049 --> 07:10.138
in hopes it helps you
fill in the blanks one day.

07:10.221 --> 07:13.182
You're gonna be looking
for answers.

07:15.434 --> 07:17.520
I know I still am.

07:17.603 --> 07:22.024
I tried to be a good mother,

07:22.108 --> 07:23.317
wife.

07:23.401 --> 07:28.197
Didn't always come easy.

07:28.281 --> 07:30.199
I don't know why.

07:30.283 --> 07:33.870
(raspy breathing)

07:33.953 --> 07:36.080
My mother died

07:36.164 --> 07:39.917
when I was about your age.

07:40.001 --> 07:42.295
Your grandpa...

07:42.378 --> 07:43.880
(inhales)

07:43.963 --> 07:45.631
Well...

07:46.966 --> 07:49.010
...you know Grandpa.

07:49.093 --> 07:50.720
QUINN (distantly):
<i>Baby girl.</i>

07:50.803 --> 07:53.723
(raspy breathing)

07:53.806 --> 07:56.100
(people laughing, talking)

07:56.184 --> 07:57.435
{\an3}QUINN:
Baby girl!

07:57.518 --> 07:59.770
{\an1}MOLLY:
Daddy?

07:59.854 --> 08:01.814
One and the same.

08:01.898 --> 08:05.193
{\an3}(laughing)

08:05.276 --> 08:06.444
Mmm!

08:06.527 --> 08:09.447
{\an3}Brought you some
cotton candy.

08:09.530 --> 08:11.073
{\an3}(laughs)

08:11.157 --> 08:12.200
What's happening?

08:12.283 --> 08:13.868
This is our special day.

08:13.951 --> 08:17.246
You are going to have
the time of your life.

08:17.330 --> 08:19.749
(maniacal laughter)

08:37.475 --> 08:38.726
Take the restraints off.

08:38.808 --> 08:41.229
{\an3}Why, are we gonna
play chess?

08:41.312 --> 08:43.438
No.

08:43.522 --> 08:45.274
{\an1}Molly Woods
has turned herself in

08:45.358 --> 08:46.734
{\an1}in exchange
for your release.

08:46.817 --> 08:49.278
Where is she?

08:52.073 --> 08:53.449
We're doing all we can for her.

08:53.533 --> 08:55.076
Doing all you can?

08:55.159 --> 08:57.286
You mean like releasing a virus
that's killing her?

08:57.370 --> 08:59.622
Where the hell is she?

08:59.705 --> 09:00.998
In quarantine.

09:01.082 --> 09:02.583
Now listen, you were there.

09:02.667 --> 09:04.126
You saw them.
What can you tell me?

09:04.210 --> 09:05.461
'Cause I need something.

09:05.544 --> 09:06.796
{\an3}Oh, you need
something.

09:06.879 --> 09:09.465
I'm not telling you anything

09:09.548 --> 09:11.550
until I see Molly.

09:19.058 --> 09:21.310
(children shouting, laughing)

09:23.896 --> 09:27.483
L-Let's play that Alien
game first, all right?

09:27.567 --> 09:30.611
{\an5}MOLLY: Okay. Can we?
QUINN: Yeah, that's why
we're here, that's what I said.

09:30.695 --> 09:31.988
{\an3}MAN:
Good to see you.

09:53.801 --> 09:55.303
I wish Mommy was here.

09:55.386 --> 09:58.055
Oh, well, uh, she had
to run some errands.

09:58.139 --> 10:00.433
{\an3}Uh, but, uh, this
is our special day.

10:06.939 --> 10:07.857
{\an1}MOLLY:
Wait.

10:07.940 --> 10:08.816
{\an1}QUINN:
What's the matter?

10:08.899 --> 10:09.817
That's Ethan.

10:09.900 --> 10:11.235
Who?

10:11.319 --> 10:13.404
{\an3}Ethan, wait!
(groans)

10:15.239 --> 10:16.157
Come on, baby.

10:16.240 --> 10:17.658
{\an3}We don't have
very much time.

10:17.742 --> 10:18.701
{\an3}Come on.

10:18.784 --> 10:22.079
{\an3}Come on, let's go... we're
going to go this way.

10:23.581 --> 10:26.500
I never meant
to hurt Lucy.

10:26.584 --> 10:28.210
{\an1}I don't want
to hurt anyone.

10:28.294 --> 10:29.670
Ever.

10:29.754 --> 10:31.672
And you never
will, Ethan.

10:31.756 --> 10:34.675
You're not like the
others, like Lucy.

10:34.759 --> 10:37.094
You have humanity.

10:37.178 --> 10:40.890
{\an1}And the other Humanichs,
like Lucy,

10:40.973 --> 10:42.767
they don't have this?

10:45.436 --> 10:48.064
I don't think so.

10:48.147 --> 10:51.067
Ethan, when I changed
your memory function,

10:51.150 --> 10:55.029
I was trying to keep you from
the pain of losing your parents.

10:58.366 --> 11:00.409
Ethan, your mo...

11:01.494 --> 11:04.246
Molly is very sick.

11:04.330 --> 11:06.332
{\an1}What's the matter
with her?

11:08.334 --> 11:10.252
Turns out that her
body went through

11:10.336 --> 11:12.797
{\an3}some pretty unusual changes
after her pregnancy.

11:12.880 --> 11:14.799
What kind of changes?

11:14.882 --> 11:17.927
{\an3}There are parts of the
hybrids inside of her...

11:20.304 --> 11:23.307
{\an3}...that are making her
feel more like them.

11:26.060 --> 11:27.269
Ethan,

11:27.353 --> 11:30.439
{\an3}Molly may not
get better,

11:30.523 --> 11:33.150
and the thing she wants
the most is to see you.

11:35.528 --> 11:38.239
I'd like that.

11:38.322 --> 11:40.282
{\an3}First,

11:40.366 --> 11:42.159
{\an3}there's something
we need to do.

11:48.040 --> 11:49.959
You sure you're
okay with this?

11:50.042 --> 11:51.961
I'm sure.

11:52.044 --> 11:53.796
{\an1}All right.

11:53.879 --> 11:55.714
See you on the other side, bud.

11:57.216 --> 11:59.427
VERDISIGN:
Root core has been accessed.

11:59.510 --> 12:01.387
Are you sure
you wish to proceed?

12:09.019 --> 12:10.438
Memory download is commencing.

12:13.232 --> 12:14.316
{\an3}I put the family
in the space station,

12:14.400 --> 12:16.110
they'd be safe.

12:18.529 --> 12:19.447
Want to try mine?

12:19.530 --> 12:20.990
Okay.

12:21.073 --> 12:22.825
{\an3}Mom, you made me
drop my ice cream!

12:22.908 --> 12:23.909
Have this one.

12:25.494 --> 12:27.705
{\an3}This is how my dad taught me,
and I fell a lot.

12:27.788 --> 12:28.956
Dad, let go.

12:29.039 --> 12:30.166
Ethan!

12:30.249 --> 12:31.667
Do you want to teach me more?

12:36.130 --> 12:37.256
JOHN:
Ethan!

12:39.550 --> 12:41.469
VERDISIGN:
Memory download is complete.

12:41.552 --> 12:42.970
(sighs)

12:43.053 --> 12:44.346
It's done.

12:49.602 --> 12:51.437
Hi, Charlie.

12:55.483 --> 12:57.359
Hi, Julie.

12:59.945 --> 13:01.989
Hi, Rabbit.

13:03.616 --> 13:06.035
I need tissue, blood,
bone marrow panels up now.

13:06.118 --> 13:08.329
I need matches
to Molly's results.

13:08.412 --> 13:11.332
{\an3}Tommy, bring up the
previous viral constructs.

13:11.415 --> 13:14.251
{\an3}Let's see if we missed
anything there.

13:14.335 --> 13:15.711
{\an1}Naomi, we're gonna take
the little girl,

13:15.794 --> 13:18.380
{\an1}see if there's anything
different about her pathology.

13:41.570 --> 13:43.239
I'm hungry.

13:43.322 --> 13:44.657
Anyone else hungry?

13:54.375 --> 13:56.210
(beep, door hissing open)

14:19.858 --> 14:21.777
{\an3}Hey.

14:21.860 --> 14:24.905
It's me.

14:28.701 --> 14:32.454
{\an3}Crazy couple
of weeks, huh?

14:32.538 --> 14:35.624
You, uh, turned my
world upside down,

14:35.708 --> 14:38.627
and then you gave it
a good shake.

14:38.711 --> 14:41.714
But, you know what, I wouldn't
change a second of it.

14:44.216 --> 14:47.803
You opened my
eyes, Molly.

14:47.886 --> 14:50.598
Y-You made me see things

14:50.681 --> 14:55.436
{\an3}in myself and other
people that...

14:55.519 --> 14:59.440
{\an1}I never would have
found on my own.

14:59.523 --> 15:01.984
{\an1}That's what
you do, you...

15:02.067 --> 15:05.613
you make the world see things.

15:05.696 --> 15:06.822
That's your gift.

15:06.905 --> 15:09.366
You are the bravest

15:09.450 --> 15:11.660
and strongest person

15:11.744 --> 15:15.372
that I've ever met
in my entire life.

15:15.456 --> 15:18.417
You fight this.

15:18.500 --> 15:21.337
You beat this virus.

15:21.420 --> 15:24.381
{\an1}Damn it,
don't you give up.

15:24.465 --> 15:27.885
{\an1}People,
they-they need you.

15:30.054 --> 15:32.056
I need you.

15:49.907 --> 15:51.909
{\an1}I, um...

15:54.662 --> 15:57.498
{\an1}...got a bottle
of scotch in my office.

16:01.168 --> 16:03.712
That's my drink of choice.

16:06.632 --> 16:09.760
{\an5}MAN (distantly, echoing):
<i>They call it a game</i>
<i>of chance... game of chance.</i>

16:09.843 --> 16:11.804
{\an3}(carnival music plays)
<i>There is no chance.</i>

16:11.887 --> 16:14.765
They call it a game of chance,

16:14.848 --> 16:18.477
but here at the carnival,
there is no chance.

16:18.560 --> 16:23.273
Here, everything happens
for a reason.

16:23.357 --> 16:25.693
In your line of work,
there are no coincidences.

16:25.776 --> 16:27.403
That's right, little lady.

16:27.486 --> 16:29.238
{\an6}QUINN:
Now, you leave my
daughter alone.

16:29.321 --> 16:31.573
{\an3}She's not interested in
playing any of your games.

16:31.657 --> 16:33.784
{\an1}Now, baby girl,
if we linger,

16:33.867 --> 16:36.078
we gonna miss the chance
to play Galactic Attack.

16:36.161 --> 16:38.580
Huh? Come on.

16:38.664 --> 16:40.916
{\an1}Whew, never know
what kind of characters

16:40.999 --> 16:42.418
{\an1}you're gonna meet
in a carnival.

16:42.501 --> 16:44.920
{\an1}I guess that's
part of the charm.

16:45.003 --> 16:46.547
Here we are.

16:49.216 --> 16:51.135
QUINN: Hey, what do
you know about that?

16:51.218 --> 16:52.636
That's Mrs. Caber,

16:52.720 --> 16:54.179
the next-door neighbor.

16:56.765 --> 16:58.434
Um, now, baby, here.

16:58.517 --> 17:01.895
You get busy bringing these
aliens back to Earth, okay?

17:01.979 --> 17:03.897
{\an3}And don't you
wander off now.

17:03.981 --> 17:05.898
I'm gonna pay
my respects.

17:05.983 --> 17:07.693
I don't want to be alone, Daddy.

17:07.776 --> 17:09.611
Don't worry, I'll be back.

17:09.694 --> 17:11.405
Please.

17:14.867 --> 17:17.453
{\an1}Want to help
the Galactic Attack?

17:33.427 --> 17:35.637
Here's the thing
about tofu tuna.

17:35.721 --> 17:38.182
It tastes like tofu that's
been stored in dirty socks.

17:38.265 --> 17:40.184
{\an1}TOMMY: You ever wonder
what real tuna tasted like?

17:40.267 --> 17:42.644
{\an3}NATE:
Every time I eat sock tuna.

17:42.728 --> 17:45.522
{\an3}Why I'm eating genetically
engineered tofu instead of...

17:51.278 --> 17:53.614
What the hell?

17:59.578 --> 18:02.206
{\an1}NATE:
Naomi?

18:02.289 --> 18:05.000
TERRA:
I think you're looking for me.

18:16.929 --> 18:19.056
{\an3}That ain't
half bad.

18:19.139 --> 18:20.641
25 years old.

18:20.724 --> 18:21.975
{\an1}It was a gift
from the president.

18:23.977 --> 18:26.980
{\an3}Let me ask you
something, General.

18:27.064 --> 18:29.191
How is it you make
a virus like that

18:29.274 --> 18:30.859
and not an antidote?

18:30.943 --> 18:34.655
{\an1}We didn't have
the luxury of time,

18:34.738 --> 18:37.950
and I didn't know
that Molly was...

18:40.577 --> 18:44.081
You care for her
quite a bit, don't you?

18:55.092 --> 18:57.094
I hate playing catch-up.

19:02.099 --> 19:03.851
{\an1}Aliens.

19:03.934 --> 19:06.937
{\an1}Intelligent life-forms
from another galaxy.

19:07.020 --> 19:11.066
I've seen some things since this
started I never thought I'd see.

19:14.027 --> 19:16.947
{\an3}Seems to me, it's not
about what you see,

19:17.030 --> 19:19.616
{\an3}it's what you do
about what you see.

19:21.118 --> 19:23.829
{\an1}Oh, uh, this the, uh,
moral high ground

19:23.912 --> 19:25.581
{\an1}you're about
to take again?

19:25.664 --> 19:28.584
{\an3}Terrorists aren't
born, they are made.

19:28.667 --> 19:30.752
{\an3}They're made by
dropping bioweapons

19:30.836 --> 19:33.005
{\an3}when you say you
have a peace treaty.

19:33.088 --> 19:36.758
{\an3}Or by wiping out a
platoon of your people

19:36.842 --> 19:38.635
because you may
or may not have a shot

19:38.719 --> 19:40.679
at a single high-value target.

19:40.762 --> 19:42.431
Oh, so now we're talking
Second Kuwait,

19:42.514 --> 19:43.765
not about hybrids.

19:43.849 --> 19:45.642
I lost a lot of men.

19:45.726 --> 19:47.853
And walked away
from the fight.

19:47.936 --> 19:50.105
It didn't seem
like my fight anymore.

19:50.188 --> 19:51.607
Something you learn

19:51.690 --> 19:53.567
when you're the one
giving the orders--

19:53.650 --> 19:55.444
{\an1}sometimes

19:55.527 --> 19:57.070
there are no good decisions.

19:57.154 --> 19:58.614
It's just a lesser of two evils.

19:58.697 --> 20:01.825
And from my seat,
that's the best that you can do.

20:01.909 --> 20:02.951
Evil is still evil, General.

20:03.035 --> 20:05.245
Even when it's lesser.

20:13.879 --> 20:15.797
She thinks I killed her husband.

20:15.881 --> 20:18.133
Molly does.

20:19.927 --> 20:21.887
So do I.

20:23.180 --> 20:24.640
He was my friend.

20:24.723 --> 20:26.350
{\an3}Your friend that
just happened to have

20:26.433 --> 20:27.976
an accident
while you were stealing

20:28.060 --> 20:30.437
his program
out from underneath him.

20:30.520 --> 20:33.815
Seems awfully coincidental,
don't you think?

20:33.899 --> 20:35.484
{\an1}Yeah.

20:37.945 --> 20:40.614
And I don't believe
in coincidences.

20:40.697 --> 20:43.367
But you do believe
he was murdered.

20:43.450 --> 20:47.162
Yes, I do.

20:47.245 --> 20:48.872
MAN:
She can't you hurt in there.

20:48.956 --> 20:50.832
It's a Faraday cage.

20:50.916 --> 20:52.167
Faraday cages.

20:52.250 --> 20:54.002
The copper in the walls
and the ceilings

20:54.086 --> 20:57.172
block radio transmission
frequencies.

20:57.255 --> 20:58.340
It also blocks hybrids
from emitting

20:58.423 --> 20:59.341
electro-magnetic impulses.

20:59.424 --> 21:00.801
{\an3}Yeah.

21:00.884 --> 21:01.969
So don't worry.

21:02.052 --> 21:04.179
We're not worried.
(chuckles)

21:04.262 --> 21:05.847
I want to go in first.

21:05.931 --> 21:06.890
Just for a second, okay?

21:06.974 --> 21:08.016
You gonna be all right?

21:08.100 --> 21:10.352
{\an1}Okay.

21:10.435 --> 21:12.854
(beep, door hissing open)

21:12.938 --> 21:15.190
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

21:17.067 --> 21:19.278
(door hissing, latch clicks)

21:24.074 --> 21:27.536
Molly, I don't know
if you can hear me.

21:27.619 --> 21:30.706
But I brought Ethan here.

21:30.789 --> 21:34.209
{\an3}I just wanted to
talk to you first.

21:40.132 --> 21:42.884
A couple things.

21:42.968 --> 21:46.888
Things I want to say.

21:46.972 --> 21:49.391
{\an3}Things I want you
to understand.

21:52.436 --> 21:55.147
{\an3}They were gonna shut
Ethan down permanently.

21:55.230 --> 21:58.900
So I took him to save him.

21:58.984 --> 22:01.236
{\an3}(crying):
And the reprogramming...

22:01.319 --> 22:05.240
He was just hurting so bad.

22:07.117 --> 22:10.203
I was so wrong.

22:10.287 --> 22:12.539
I was so foolish.

22:15.208 --> 22:18.045
But John loved you, Molly.

22:19.838 --> 22:22.132
{\an3}He loved you
to the very end.

22:22.215 --> 22:24.259
{\an3}I swear.

22:26.344 --> 22:27.929
The night he died,

22:28.013 --> 22:30.098
he was so angry.

22:30.182 --> 22:32.934
And he said I was being naive.

22:33.018 --> 22:35.103
{\an3}Molly, I...

22:35.187 --> 22:38.315
I think I may have somehow...

22:38.398 --> 22:40.859
gotten him killed.

22:43.195 --> 22:47.115
{\an3}He was right about
the Humanichs.

22:47.199 --> 22:49.701
{\an3}He said I was making
a deal with the devil.

22:51.495 --> 22:54.498
{\an3}I've made so many
wrong choices, Molly.

22:56.041 --> 22:58.085
But I promise you...

22:58.168 --> 23:00.545
I won't ever do that again.

23:02.798 --> 23:04.800
GIRL:
<i>Where's my dad? Daddy?</i>

23:04.883 --> 23:07.094
<i>Daddy?</i>

23:07.177 --> 23:09.137
Where's my daddy?

23:09.221 --> 23:10.472
Don't worry about it.

23:10.555 --> 23:12.265
{\an3}I'm sure he's around
here somewhere.

23:12.349 --> 23:13.642
{\an3}Hey!
Daddy!

23:13.725 --> 23:14.643
Wait, come back!

23:14.726 --> 23:15.769
Daddy!

23:16.728 --> 23:19.189
Daddy!

23:20.899 --> 23:23.485
Daddy!

23:31.576 --> 23:33.620
{\an3}(moaning)

23:35.288 --> 23:36.623
Daddy?

23:37.749 --> 23:39.835
{\an3}Daddy!

23:39.918 --> 23:41.294
Honey...

23:41.378 --> 23:44.214
I remember now.

23:44.297 --> 23:46.550
You brought me here

23:46.633 --> 23:50.345
so you could have your tryst
with Mrs. Caber.

23:50.428 --> 23:51.847
Baby girl...

23:51.930 --> 23:53.849
(crying):
How could you?

23:53.932 --> 23:56.643
{\an1}Wait!

23:56.726 --> 23:59.521
We do it and we do it now.

23:59.604 --> 24:00.689
CHARLIE:
Wait.

24:00.772 --> 24:02.315
What are you saying, Julie?

24:02.399 --> 24:03.358
I'm saying I don't care

24:03.442 --> 24:05.318
what happens,
I'm not making

24:05.402 --> 24:07.571
the wrong decision again.

24:09.447 --> 24:11.533
Shut the program down, Charlie.

24:11.616 --> 24:13.577
You realize we could go
to jail for this.

24:17.289 --> 24:19.374
Yeah, I do.

24:19.457 --> 24:22.836
Okay, just so we're
on the same page.

24:28.425 --> 24:31.428
I need the security doors
opened.

24:33.138 --> 24:34.848
Of course, General Shepherd.

24:34.931 --> 24:37.392
Happy to help.

24:46.318 --> 24:47.527
Terra.

24:49.779 --> 24:51.114
It worked.

24:51.198 --> 24:52.282
They thought I was dead.

24:52.365 --> 24:55.076
We tried it Ahdu's way.

24:55.160 --> 24:58.246
And now we do it mine.

25:05.837 --> 25:07.172
(gun cocks)

25:09.466 --> 25:12.552
(gunshot)

25:18.475 --> 25:21.311
All right, here's...
here's what I know.

25:21.394 --> 25:23.813
{\an1}John went to Humanichs,
he-he got in a fight

37:53.771 --> 37:54.689
{\an1}Now!

37:54.772 --> 37:57.191
(monitor flatlines)

37:57.274 --> 38:00.361
(alarm sounding)

38:00.444 --> 38:02.905
(door hissing closed,
latch clicks)

38:08.077 --> 38:10.371
(alarm sounds)

38:10.454 --> 38:12.373
There's poetry to
it, isn't there?

38:12.456 --> 38:15.501
{\an3}They make a virus
to destroy us.

38:15.584 --> 38:17.878
{\an3}We release viruses
to destroy them.

38:21.882 --> 38:24.885
{\an3}Hey, we're
counting on you.

38:28.514 --> 38:30.224
ELECTRONIC VOICE:
System overload.

38:30.307 --> 38:34.395
System overload.
System overload.

38:34.478 --> 38:36.772
(monitor continues flatlining)
