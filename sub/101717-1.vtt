10:52.853 --> 10:56.489
and it was absolute madness
over there.

10:56.623 --> 10:59.793
My ground transport
had gotten screwed up,
so I grabbed a taxi.

10:59.927 --> 11:00.994
I was running about
an hour late

11:01.128 --> 11:03.463
and was a little
out of sorts,

11:03.596 --> 11:05.032
so I'm sure
I put the driver on edge,

11:05.165 --> 11:07.200
although he seemed
pretty unflappable,

11:07.334 --> 11:09.336
and he had a hell
of a heavy foot.

11:09.469 --> 11:12.672
Anyway,
we're doing our best.
Traffic is terrible.

11:12.806 --> 11:14.374
The guy's
bobbing and weaving,

11:14.507 --> 11:17.144
and I'm trying to relax
with one eye on the clock.

11:17.277 --> 11:22.315
Meanwhile, Jerzy's been
sitting at the Lucky Duck
for 45 minutes,

11:22.449 --> 11:24.952
so given his usual
15 minutes a drink,

11:25.085 --> 11:29.022
Jerzy's just finished
his third gin and tonic
with a fourth on the way.

11:29.156 --> 11:31.458
Now, I think the world
and all of Jerzy,

11:31.591 --> 11:33.961
but at his best,
he's a bit stroppy,

11:34.094 --> 11:36.329
and after
four or five G&Ts,

11:36.463 --> 11:38.698
he's starting to look around
for someone to mess with.

11:38.832 --> 11:40.768
So I'm feeling a little...

11:41.802 --> 11:44.071
Vulnerable.

11:44.204 --> 11:46.339
I'm looking out the window.
We're stopped at a light.

11:47.607 --> 11:50.143
And all of a sudden,

11:50.277 --> 11:52.045
right there in the middle
of the intersection

11:52.179 --> 11:53.914
is this scrawny little cat.

11:54.047 --> 11:56.049
A kitten, really.

11:56.183 --> 12:00.687
Crying, meowing, scared to
death, and traffic everywhere.

12:00.821 --> 12:02.289
I mean everywhere.

12:02.422 --> 12:03.824
Four lanes.

12:03.957 --> 12:05.158
And I just...

12:08.028 --> 12:10.063
And then the cat
looked at me.

12:11.698 --> 12:13.834
Stopped crying.
Closed its mouth.

12:13.967 --> 12:14.935
Blinked.

12:16.469 --> 12:18.171
And just stared at me.

12:19.807 --> 12:20.974
Like...

12:25.846 --> 12:26.880
Like it knew me.

12:30.250 --> 12:31.885
It took a couple
of steps forward.

12:32.019 --> 12:34.187
I started to open the door.

12:34.321 --> 12:36.556
And phooph...
The taxi took off.

12:36.689 --> 12:37.791
And there we went.

12:40.060 --> 12:41.995
And there went the cat.

12:49.302 --> 12:50.703
Jerzy was fine.

19:26.699 --> 19:29.469
Masha, Reddington
didn't choose you.

19:29.602 --> 19:31.504
He needed you.

19:31.638 --> 19:34.474
He traded on the questions
you have about your past

19:34.607 --> 19:35.875
to gain immunity.

19:36.008 --> 19:37.810
He gives you criminals,
and in exchange,

19:37.944 --> 19:40.447
he learns the names of
every high-level official

19:40.580 --> 19:43.015
working in
American justice,

19:43.149 --> 19:45.084
law enforcement,
and intelligence.

19:45.218 --> 19:46.319

Reddington's been using me,

19:47.687 --> 19:49.121
the Task Force

19:49.256 --> 19:51.991

manipulate you

20:14.314 --> 20:16.449
Why you let your banker
meet with Reddington.

20:16.583 --> 20:19.252
Why you wanted
Reddington to have us
chase after Roanoke.

20:19.386 --> 20:23.222

find the warehouse,
find the photo.

Warn Reddington that
you are going after Dom,

in a well-guarded warehouse.

20:29.429 --> 20:31.030
But if they think
it's under attack...

20:31.163 --> 20:33.733
Reddington will move Dom,
and while he's being moved...

20:33.866 --> 20:35.067
He's a soft target.

20:35.201 --> 20:37.437

That's quite a plan.

20:37.570 --> 20:39.872
And it could work.

20:40.006 --> 20:43.142
It almost has worked
in every way except one.

20:46.446 --> 20:48.681
The FBI didn't find
that photo. I did.

20:50.583 --> 20:53.185

is in your hands.
