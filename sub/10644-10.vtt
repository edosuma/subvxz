I... I just don't think
he was a good man.

16:04.132 --> 16:08.631
I think that he had always
had a thing for my mother,

16:08.632 --> 16:11.831
and he married her so she
would lock me up in Pineview,

16:11.849 --> 16:13.810
and he would have her all to himself.

16:15.501 --> 16:16.978
And then when I was released,

16:17.042 --> 16:18.831
he still tried to turn her against me,

16:18.832 --> 16:21.961
saying that I was unstable, and...

16:21.962 --> 16:23.251
he just wanted me out of the way,

16:23.252 --> 16:24.591
but thankfully, she knew it,

16:24.592 --> 16:28.041

39:15.129 --> 39:17.378
Mother, look at me.

39:19.299 --> 39:21.628
Look at me, Mother.

39:21.629 --> 39:23.298
I'm right here, Mother. Look at me.

39:28.169 --> 39:31.168
Mother, look at me now.

39:31.169 --> 39:32.208
[door clicks]

39:32.209 --> 39:34.668
Hello?

39:34.669 --> 39:37.128
Hello?

39:37.129 --> 39:40.508
[door creaking]

39:40.509 --> 39:42.499
- Can I help you?
- I'm sorry.

39:42.512 --> 39:44.918
I... uh, the door was open.
I didn't mean to barge in.

39:44.919 --> 39:46.509
[door thuds closed]

39:52.549 --> 39:54.749
I heard about your mother.

39:57.339 --> 40:00.508
She was a lovely woman...

40:00.509 --> 40:03.168
too lovely for this world.

40:03.169 --> 40:05.338
It'll be a darker place without her.

40:05.339 --> 40:07.958
I'm so sorry.

40:07.959 --> 40:10.548
[sighs] Yes, well, I'm, uh...

40:10.549 --> 40:12.128
thank you, but it...

40:12.129 --> 40:14.838
this is really just
not a good time, so...

40:14.839 --> 40:16.128
I... I understand.

40:16.129 --> 40:17.879
I just wanted to do something.

40:25.209 --> 40:28.088
Chicken enchilada casserole.

40:28.089 --> 40:29.589
I made it.

40:33.549 --> 40:36.298
<i>[suspenseful music]</i>

40:40.089 --> 40:43.918
Thank you for stopping by.

40:43.919 --> 40:46.748
I, uh... this is really
very kind of you, very much.

40:46.749 --> 40:51.128
So I heard the funeral...
it was... it was today, yeah?

40:51.129 --> 40:52.878
- Right?
- Yes, it was.

41:01.669 --> 41:03.298
Hmm.

41:08.249 --> 41:11.458
Death.

41:11.459 --> 41:15.128
It's a rough one, isn't it?

41:15.129 --> 41:18.548
It's hard for our brains to accept.

41:18.549 --> 41:21.708
You see the person every day.

41:21.709 --> 41:24.298
And then...

41:24.299 --> 41:26.668
pff.

41:26.669 --> 41:28.049
They're gone.

41:35.209 --> 41:38.839
You do what you have to do.

41:42.459 --> 41:46.128
But you understand she's dead.

41:46.129 --> 41:47.299
Right?

41:55.379 --> 41:57.918
I-I want to come and check
on you in a few days,

41:57.919 --> 42:00.008
if that's okay.

42:00.009 --> 42:01.839
It's the least that I can do.

42:05.459 --> 42:07.548
Enjoy the casserole, son.

42:55.209 --> 42:57.299

45:26.129 --> 45:28.338
Hi, honey.

45:28.339 --> 45:30.958
You're here.

45:30.959 --> 45:33.958
You did come back. I
thought you'd left me.

45:33.959 --> 45:36.452
I'd never leave you. You know that.

45:42.299 --> 45:46.458
Mother...

45:46.459 --> 45:48.958
We're home. We're finally together.

45:48.959 --> 45:51.838
Yes, honey, forever and ever.
