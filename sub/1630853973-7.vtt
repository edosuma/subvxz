for the taking.

20:50.822 --> 20:52.781
And we would be met
with no resistance

20:52.824 --> 20:55.087
-if we hauled them away.
-He's lying.

20:55.131 --> 20:57.829
It came from a prissy
little robot. Peanut Butter.

PEANUT HAMPER:
What? That's crazy.

21:02.051 --> 21:05.837
-Uh, this guy is so full of it.
-Obviously, we recorded it.

21:05.881 --> 21:06.925
PEANUT HAMPER [recorded]:
Anyway,

21:06.969 --> 21:08.100
those are the coordinates.

21:08.144 --> 21:10.015
The ships are all underground.

21:10.059 --> 21:11.582
Feel free to come on over and
take whatever you want.

21:11.626 --> 21:13.410
Everyone here
is a tree-kissing farmer.

21:13.454 --> 21:15.107
There won't be any pushback.

21:15.151 --> 21:16.935
PEANUT HAMPER:
Oh. [scoffs] What?

21:16.979 --> 21:18.720
That doesn't even sound like me.

21:18.763 --> 21:21.113
My love, is this true?

21:21.157 --> 21:22.898
PEANUT HAMPER:
Ugh, okay, fine.

21:22.941 --> 21:26.162
I called the Drookmani here.
But it was for a good cause.

21:26.205 --> 21:27.511
You guys didn't want
these ships,

21:27.555 --> 21:29.078
and I needed a way
to show Starfleet

21:29.121 --> 21:30.906
that I'm a hero
so they would take me back.

21:30.949 --> 21:33.300
How was I supposed to know
these old ships still worked?

21:33.343 --> 21:34.823
I mean, they were
built by organics.

21:34.866 --> 21:36.564
People who make things
out of straw.

21:36.607 --> 21:39.088
-Yeah, what are the odds?
-But-but Peanut...

21:39.131 --> 21:40.263
PEANUT HAMPER:
Oh, my God,

21:40.307 --> 21:42.004
just shut the [bleep] up, Rawda.

21:42.047 --> 21:43.484
Grow a [bleep] beak.

21:43.527 --> 21:45.050
I wasn't going to spend
the rest of my very long,

robotic life
on a frickin' bird planet.

21:47.401 --> 21:49.707

How could you?

21:49.751 --> 21:51.840
PEANUT HAMPER: Oh, boy,
here comes the waterworks.

21:51.883 --> 21:55.452
This guy cries at everything.
He even cries after we do it.

21:55.496 --> 21:56.888
TENDI:
Wait, Peanut Hamper.

21:56.932 --> 21:58.629
You still have a chance
to be a hero.

21:58.673 --> 22:00.414
Someone has to get onto
that ship, and I think it's...

22:00.457 --> 22:02.590
PEANUT HAMPER: I see where
this is going, and no, thanks.

22:02.633 --> 22:05.375
Get back here right now, Ensign.
That's an order!

22:05.419 --> 22:06.768
PEANUT HAMPER:
Smell you later.

22:06.811 --> 22:08.030
Oh, yeah,
and I mean that literally,

22:08.073 --> 22:09.901
'cause y'all [bleep] everywhere.

22:29.094 --> 22:31.096
Billups, how are they getting
through our shields?

22:31.140 --> 22:33.142
I don't know, I'm trying
to match signatures,

22:33.185 --> 22:35.971
but the shields are at 16%
and falling.

The Areore must protect
their way of life.

23:41.515 --> 23:44.735
We can live how we desire.

We did it!

Organics and technology
working together.

24:00.229 --> 24:02.797
This is what I was trying
to teach you all along.

24:02.840 --> 24:04.625
You are no longer welcome
on Areolus.

24:04.668 --> 24:06.104
Get out of here.

24:06.148 --> 24:07.454
PEANUT HAMPER:
Oh, whatever.

24:07.497 --> 24:08.672
I didn't want
to stay here anyway.

24:08.716 --> 24:10.413
You're like
the poor man's Aurelians.

24:10.457 --> 24:12.894

There is no way in hell

you're coming back
on my ship, missy.

You're all just jealous

24:17.725 --> 24:19.117
of my advanced intelligence.

24:19.161 --> 24:21.206
You know who I should've called?
The Borg.

24:21.250 --> 24:23.470
Oh, yeah.
The Borg would love me.

24:23.513 --> 24:24.819
I'm gonna do it right now,
in fact.

24:24.862 --> 24:26.473
You're all going
to get assimilated.

24:26.516 --> 24:29.084
See how you like being
organic then. Huh? Huh?

Stop that. Don't touch me.

I love it here.
Not an organic to be found.

I must say, that's
