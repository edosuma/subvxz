WEBVTT

00:04.577 --> 00:07.579
Is it just me or is this one of
the scariest movies ever made?

00:07.647 --> 00:11.049
Oh, yeah, compared to the
cartoons we usually watch.

00:13.853 --> 00:16.488
No! Don't go in there.

00:23.545 --> 00:24.785
Mommy...

00:26.205 --> 00:28.733
Aiden, you scared your daddy.

00:29.647 --> 00:30.836
What are you watching?

00:31.449 --> 00:32.360
Nothing.

00:32.998 --> 00:36.484
Just a silly movie
about...hungry people.

00:36.484 --> 00:38.210
Isn't it past your bedtime?

00:38.277 --> 00:40.842
I can't...I can't sleep.

00:40.842 --> 00:42.447
Why not? Did you have a bad dream?

00:42.515 --> 00:45.506
No. I need flash.

00:45.506 --> 00:47.619
Flash?  Flashlight flash?

00:47.687 --> 00:48.893
I thought you, uh, lost him.

00:48.893 --> 00:51.145
Yeah, I thought you didn't
need him to sleep anymore.

00:51.145 --> 00:53.420
But I need flash back.

00:53.420 --> 00:54.630
Well...

00:54.630 --> 00:56.406
How about a snuggle
with your mommy instead?

00:56.406 --> 00:58.853
Ok. But not a "gotta go" snuggle,

00:58.853 --> 01:00.170
A "forever" snuggle.

01:00.170 --> 01:01.333
You got it.

01:01.400 --> 01:02.901
Good night, sport.

01:02.969 --> 01:04.135
Let's go!

01:04.203 --> 01:06.771
Come on, forever snuggle! Let's go.

01:11.210 --> 01:14.079
First session with Nathan Weiss.

01:14.206 --> 01:19.155
Referred to me by Dr.
Ulrich at university medical.

01:19.252 --> 01:20.962
At patient's request,

01:20.962 --> 01:22.940
session taking place at his residence.

01:22.940 --> 01:25.590
The sweetest place in the county.

01:25.658 --> 01:28.994
This guy's software
really must be selling.

01:30.400 --> 01:32.252
Omit the last remark.

01:38.790 --> 01:39.614
Can I help you?

01:39.614 --> 01:40.700
Hi. I'm Dr. Eli James.

01:40.700 --> 01:42.988
I have an appointment with Mr. Weiss.

01:42.988 --> 01:44.543
Identification.

01:44.610 --> 01:47.412
There you go.

01:48.490 --> 01:50.261
Do you have your signed paperwork?

01:50.329 --> 01:51.662
Paperwork?

01:51.730 --> 01:53.598
Consent to privacy on top,

01:53.665 --> 01:56.601
Non-competition in
trading on the bottom.

01:56.668 --> 01:58.736
How long will you be on the premises?

01:58.804 --> 02:02.144
It depends. I'm not a very fast reader.

02:03.709 --> 02:06.244
I didn't think your security
guard was ever gonna let me in.

02:06.311 --> 02:07.712
I know. It's embarrassing, really,

02:07.780 --> 02:09.213
But, see, I gotta keep security tight,

02:09.281 --> 02:11.816
Especially when I'm about to
release a new line of software.

02:11.884 --> 02:14.449
I read about that. You
should know, I'm a fan.

02:14.449 --> 02:17.755
I can't get through my day without
your video conferencing app.

02:17.823 --> 02:21.692
You know, actually, we narrowly
avoided having that program pirated.

02:22.112 --> 02:23.928
Is that why you moved
the business to your home?

02:23.996 --> 02:24.908
No, I just work better here.

02:24.908 --> 02:25.855
Excuse me, Mr. Weiss.

02:25.855 --> 02:27.732
You know, this is gonna be great.

02:27.800 --> 02:29.848
We'll have a meeting about
this tomorrow. Thanks.

02:30.269 --> 02:33.404
See, the thing is,
I'm having some issues.

02:33.472 --> 02:35.151
Uh, like, for example,

02:35.151 --> 02:38.109
I feel like someone
is always watching me.

02:39.211 --> 02:41.160
I can relate.

02:46.622 --> 02:48.553
Listen, I, uh, I read a paper

02:48.620 --> 02:51.871
that you published about
using behavioral therapy

02:51.871 --> 02:54.659
to treat paranoia in the short term.

02:54.726 --> 02:58.830
And, uh, that's what I'm
interested in. Short term.

02:58.897 --> 03:02.033
The security, the locks, the...

03:02.101 --> 03:04.402
Uh, yeah, it's not just
about trade secrets.

03:04.470 --> 03:06.144
I...I'm paranoid.

03:06.144 --> 03:09.807
With a little undercurrent of
obsessive-compulsive disorder.

03:09.875 --> 03:11.414
Oh, hell.

03:17.816 --> 03:20.384
See, lately, with everything
riding on this launch,

03:20.452 --> 03:25.356
I have not been able to
manage my, um, uh, um, habits.

03:25.356 --> 03:29.418
Look, any anxiety-based disorder will
escalate due to your stress level.

03:29.418 --> 03:30.729
There are medications
that you can take...

03:30.729 --> 03:31.974
No, I don't... I don't want to medicate.

03:31.974 --> 03:33.598
Ok. With hard work and time...

03:33.665 --> 03:35.023
Well, that's all fine and good,

03:35.023 --> 03:37.355
Except the time part. I don't have any.

03:37.355 --> 03:40.800
Listen, are there not any...any
tricks that you can teach me

03:40.800 --> 03:42.682
To just help me control
this for now? I mean,

03:42.682 --> 03:46.077
I have this press conference
announcing the launch this week.

03:46.145 --> 03:50.007
I mean, I...if I have a panic
attack in front of the whole world...

03:50.007 --> 03:52.695
There's no quick fix for
what you have, Nathan.

03:53.318 --> 03:55.621
If you get me through this
week, I'll buy you a boat.

03:55.650 --> 03:58.693
A very fast, large boat.

03:59.516 --> 04:00.854
I like boats.

04:00.922 --> 04:03.924
Ok. Let's get started.

04:04.329 --> 04:08.303
Patient exhibits extreme
anxiety, paranoia,

04:08.472 --> 04:11.164
and impulse control issues.

04:11.232 --> 04:13.533
But on the plus side, I
think he's going to invite me

04:13.601 --> 04:15.535
to his annual party in Aspen.

04:15.603 --> 04:18.370
Cancel christmas plans,
keep December open.

04:20.000 --> 04:26.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

06:17.296 --> 06:18.959
Who's out there?

06:36.544 --> 06:37.956
Come on, come on, come on.

06:37.956 --> 06:39.816
Where are you, Bruce?

06:39.816 --> 06:40.556
Come on!

06:41.884 --> 06:43.146
Come on, come on, come on.

06:47.790 --> 06:48.752
Bruce, what's going on out there?

06:48.752 --> 06:50.380
Sir, this is A.R.S. Alarm service.

06:50.380 --> 06:52.794
Can I please have your password?

06:54.159 --> 06:55.168
November.

06:55.168 --> 06:56.035
Thank you, Mr. Weiss.

06:56.035 --> 06:58.083
We received a signal
that you have an intruder.

06:58.083 --> 06:59.424
Can you verify this?

06:59.545 --> 07:01.795
I don't see anything on my cameras,

07:01.795 --> 07:04.539
but my motion detectors are
lighting up all over the place.

07:09.012 --> 07:12.347
No, this can't be. They're in my house.

07:12.415 --> 07:14.757
Sir, I've dispatched a patrol
car and notified the police.

07:14.757 --> 07:16.018
Can you get to a safe place?

07:16.085 --> 07:18.336
I...I'm in my safe room.

07:19.348 --> 07:21.556
Wait, they're jamming my system somehow.

07:21.624 --> 07:22.955
I'm losing every one of my feeds.

07:22.955 --> 07:24.983
I need help up here right now!

07:29.866 --> 07:32.968
I hear footsteps.

07:35.071 --> 07:37.539
They're...They're in my bedroom.

07:37.607 --> 07:39.374
They're right outside my door!

07:39.442 --> 07:41.654
The police are on their
way, sir. Try and stay calm.

07:44.714 --> 07:46.265
This can't be happening.

07:48.551 --> 07:49.927
They're getting inside!

07:53.670 --> 07:55.647
They're in the room with me!

08:43.080 --> 08:45.326
Wake up. We overslept.

08:45.326 --> 08:46.393
How did that happen?

08:46.460 --> 08:48.561
Our trusty alarm clock never went off.

08:48.629 --> 08:50.243
Because he was up half the night?

08:50.243 --> 08:51.731
so was I.

08:55.102 --> 08:58.204
Come on, sleepyhead, wake up.

08:58.272 --> 09:00.241
You don't want to miss the bus.

09:03.311 --> 09:06.752
Aiden? Aiden?

09:11.634 --> 09:13.068
Jim, is Aiden down here?

09:13.135 --> 09:14.669
No. I thought he was
still upstairs in bed.

09:14.737 --> 09:16.338
I can't find him.

09:16.405 --> 09:17.439
Aiden?

09:17.506 --> 09:18.940
Buddy? Where are you?

09:19.008 --> 09:21.970
Aiden, where are you, now? It's not
a good time to be playing around.

09:21.970 --> 09:23.523
- Where could he be? 
- I'll check the yard.

09:23.523 --> 09:25.282
And then I'm calling the police.

09:27.078 --> 09:28.130
Wait.

09:34.957 --> 09:36.358
Aiden?

09:37.994 --> 09:40.095
Did you find flash yet?

09:40.162 --> 09:42.630
Baby, what are you doing down here?

09:42.698 --> 09:44.933
It just felt safe.

09:45.001 --> 09:46.430
Safe from what?

09:46.430 --> 09:47.691
Was there a ghost?

09:47.759 --> 09:50.160
I don't know.

09:50.228 --> 09:51.762
It just felt safe.

09:52.393 --> 09:53.764
Come here.

09:58.670 --> 10:00.004
He couldn't sleep.

10:00.004 --> 10:01.338
He didn't feel safe in his bedroom.

10:01.406 --> 10:04.008
And this is all pretty new for him?

10:04.075 --> 10:07.344
Well,he definitely went through the
typical being scared of the dark phase,

10:07.412 --> 10:08.846
but that went away a while ago.

10:08.914 --> 10:10.347
This just feels different.

10:10.415 --> 10:12.683
He'll probably be back
to his old self soon.

10:12.751 --> 10:14.752
What makes you so sure?

10:16.388 --> 10:20.024
Eli, if you know something, spill it.

10:20.091 --> 10:22.526
Ok, Aiden's channeled
living people before, right?

10:22.594 --> 10:24.194
I don't know the rules. He's an empath.

10:24.262 --> 10:25.829
Living or dead doesn't seem to matter.

10:25.897 --> 10:28.532
But he's more inclined to pick
up things from people he knows,

10:28.600 --> 10:30.734
Maybe like you or...me?

10:31.256 --> 10:32.303
And you're his favorite uncle.

10:32.370 --> 10:34.638
So what living person
are we talking about?

10:34.706 --> 10:35.940
I can't say.

10:37.544 --> 10:38.799
It's my new patient.

10:38.799 --> 10:40.778
My very important new patient.

10:40.845 --> 10:42.046
Like career-defining important.

10:42.113 --> 10:43.881
Ok. So who is your new patient?

10:43.949 --> 10:45.382
And what is Aiden picking up on?

10:45.450 --> 10:47.017
Does it have to do with a ghost?

10:47.085 --> 10:49.219
I didn't hear any ghost.
That's all I'm saying.

10:49.287 --> 10:51.488
I'm not gonna violate
my patient's privacy.

10:51.556 --> 10:53.454
Or my shot at a chance
to ride on his new jet.

10:53.454 --> 10:55.087
Ok, so what am I
supposed to do with Aiden,

10:55.087 --> 10:56.393
Put him in therapy, too?

10:56.461 --> 10:57.895
Of course not.

10:57.963 --> 10:59.330
Unless he starts adding new patterns,

10:59.397 --> 11:00.631
like counting steps or

11:00.631 --> 11:01.865
checking and rechecking things.

11:01.933 --> 11:03.667
Wait a minute. Counting and checking?

11:03.735 --> 11:05.510
Are you talking about
obsessive-compulsive disorder?

11:05.510 --> 11:06.631
Is that what your patient has?

11:06.631 --> 11:08.393
Whoa, nobody said anything
about any disorder.

11:08.393 --> 11:10.369
This whole conversation
has been hypothetical.

11:10.369 --> 11:11.860
And even then, it's just
because you're my friend.

11:11.860 --> 11:14.528
Ok, so, I know that you
have to protect your patient,

11:14.596 --> 11:16.297
But I have to protect my son.

11:19.094 --> 11:19.863
Great.

11:19.863 --> 11:21.302
He probably knows
we're talking about him.

11:21.369 --> 11:22.851
Your patient? How would he know that?

11:22.851 --> 11:24.229
Because he's a computer genius

11:24.229 --> 11:26.307
who's paranoid enough
to probably bug my phone.

11:26.374 --> 11:28.042
Hey, that doesn't put my mind at ease.

11:28.109 --> 11:30.411
Ok. Look, let me just
work with this guy.

11:30.478 --> 11:32.379
Aiden will get better soon, ok?

11:32.447 --> 11:35.349
I see anxiety cases like this every day.

11:42.557 --> 11:45.292
You sleep on that cot
in your panic room?

11:45.360 --> 11:47.061
You don't see that every day.

11:47.128 --> 11:48.596
What?

11:49.772 --> 11:50.546
Nothing.

11:51.300 --> 11:53.567
Tell me about last night. What happened?

11:53.635 --> 11:55.402
Well, that depends on who you ask.

11:55.470 --> 11:57.071
The guard at the gate saw nothing.

11:57.138 --> 12:00.007
The police said they found
no sign of forced entry.

12:00.075 --> 12:02.977
And yet my entire security system
is lighting up like mardi gras.

12:03.044 --> 12:05.102
Cameras, motion detectors.

12:05.594 --> 12:06.750
You've had an intruder?

12:07.170 --> 12:09.183
Yeah. According to all my equipment.

12:09.251 --> 12:11.305
But there wasn't a speck
of physical evidence

12:11.305 --> 12:13.854
that any living thing set foot in here.

12:13.922 --> 12:15.956
Any living thing.

12:16.024 --> 12:18.293
Look. Look at this.

12:19.160 --> 12:21.495
See this? This is... this
is what I kept seeing.

12:21.563 --> 12:23.864
One camera... back to another.

12:23.932 --> 12:25.599
And listen, listen.

12:25.667 --> 12:26.634
Listen.

12:30.906 --> 12:32.573
Are those footsteps?

12:35.210 --> 12:39.185
Look, is it possible that
somebody broke into your system

12:39.185 --> 12:40.349
And not your house?

12:40.349 --> 12:42.349
You know, like a competitor or a hacker?

12:42.417 --> 12:44.885
No. No, no. My security
system is closed.

12:44.953 --> 12:46.386
No one could hack into this.

12:46.386 --> 12:48.522
I mean, this whole thing is just...

12:48.590 --> 12:49.923
There's no explanation.

12:49.923 --> 12:51.354
Ok, so bottom line is,

12:51.354 --> 12:52.772
we don't know who or what did this.

12:52.840 --> 12:54.908
Who or what?

12:55.760 --> 12:56.658
We don't know.

12:56.658 --> 12:57.622
Which may be a good thing.

12:57.622 --> 13:00.641
Because I'm here to help you with
your response to stressful events,

13:00.709 --> 13:01.809
Not the actual events.

13:01.877 --> 13:03.778
Ok.

13:03.845 --> 13:06.271
Ok, what... and what does that mean?

13:06.271 --> 13:08.803
Ok. I want you to try something.

13:09.584 --> 13:12.520
I want you to turn off
all the security monitors.

13:14.423 --> 13:18.125
Come on. This constant surveillance
is really feeding your anxiety.

13:18.193 --> 13:20.127
We need to modify your behaviors,

13:20.195 --> 13:23.330
to retrain your brain so you can
just ignore these compulsions.

13:23.398 --> 13:24.932
Take the first step. Come on.

13:25.000 --> 13:26.634
No, I don't think that's a good idea.

13:26.701 --> 13:28.436
Especially after what
happened last night.

13:28.503 --> 13:30.713
Why not? What's the
worst that can happen?

13:30.713 --> 13:31.874
Nathan!

13:32.441 --> 13:33.874
What are you really afraid of?

13:38.613 --> 13:40.548
Baby, what are you doing?

13:40.615 --> 13:42.477
You've opened all the drawers.

13:43.385 --> 13:45.186
Your flashlight is not in there.

13:45.253 --> 13:46.420
I know.

13:46.488 --> 13:49.527
Ok, so then why are you
looking through the drawers?

13:50.058 --> 13:51.959
Something made me.

14:07.843 --> 14:09.643
Fine, fine, ok? You win.

14:09.711 --> 14:11.712
Good. Turning it off.

14:11.780 --> 14:13.660
Look, it's off.

14:13.660 --> 14:15.182
That's a good first step.

14:15.250 --> 14:17.384
All right, now, let's take the next one.

14:17.452 --> 14:19.420
Answer the question.

14:19.488 --> 14:22.139
What are you afraid of?

14:23.225 --> 14:24.892
I know you want to lock
that door right now.

14:24.960 --> 14:26.594
It's part of your illness.

14:26.661 --> 14:27.683
You feel compelled.

14:27.683 --> 14:29.930
But you have to tell yourself
you don't have to do it.

14:29.998 --> 14:31.332
But I do. I do.

14:31.399 --> 14:33.467
- I just...'cause I have to. 
- Why, Nathan?

14:33.535 --> 14:36.103
If that's the answer, then tell me why.

14:36.171 --> 14:38.522
What's the worst that can
happen? Tell me, Nathan,

14:38.522 --> 14:40.425
And I will let you lock that door.

14:40.425 --> 14:41.942
Why, Nathan?

14:50.152 --> 14:52.019
Aiden, why are you...

15:07.369 --> 15:09.103
Why, Nathan?

15:09.171 --> 15:10.104
Tell me!

15:10.172 --> 15:11.105
I'm sorry.

15:11.173 --> 15:12.170
Why?

15:12.170 --> 15:15.442
What will happen if you
don't lock that door?

15:15.662 --> 15:17.611
Someone will die!

15:17.679 --> 15:19.213
Someone did.

15:25.687 --> 15:27.254
Did you see that?

15:27.322 --> 15:28.889
See what?

15:28.990 --> 15:30.691
I was just playing.

15:30.759 --> 15:32.693
Is that ok?

15:32.761 --> 15:33.827
Yeah.

15:50.545 --> 15:53.776
I thought...I thought
I was keeping her safe.

16:19.812 --> 16:20.913
I just want to let you know that...

16:20.980 --> 16:22.080
Morning.

16:22.148 --> 16:23.582
If Aiden had a few
bad dreams last night,

16:23.650 --> 16:24.917
It's because I'm a genius.

16:24.984 --> 16:26.118
Excuse me?

16:26.185 --> 16:28.353
As a therapist, it's
progress through pain.

16:28.421 --> 16:29.755
But it's progress.

16:29.822 --> 16:31.456
My patient went deep.

16:31.524 --> 16:33.258
We really dredged up some stuff.

16:33.326 --> 16:34.960
Yeah, I know. His little sister died.

16:35.071 --> 16:36.972
You don't really get
over something like that.

16:37.039 --> 16:39.507
It's true, you don't. You...

16:39.575 --> 16:40.809
Wait a minute.

16:40.876 --> 16:42.210
How did you know?

16:42.278 --> 16:43.645
I had a vision.

16:43.713 --> 16:46.305
Nathan was finding his
sister in the morgue.

16:46.305 --> 16:48.276
You know his name?

16:48.276 --> 16:49.317
I never told you that.

16:49.385 --> 16:51.056
Have you been following me?

16:51.056 --> 16:53.419
No. His parents were in the
vision and they called him Nathan.

16:53.419 --> 16:55.657
And you'd have to be pretty
dumb not to figure out the rest,

16:55.725 --> 16:58.493
because the computer genius, rich
enough to have a private jet...

16:58.561 --> 17:00.384
Oh, my god, I'm so sued.

17:00.384 --> 17:01.987
I signed 9 disclosure documents.

17:01.987 --> 17:03.598
Eli, will you please stop whining?

17:03.666 --> 17:05.454
Who can keep a secret better than me?

17:05.454 --> 17:06.768
Certainly not you.

17:06.836 --> 17:08.136
I'm not saying another word.

17:08.204 --> 17:09.599
Not till I get a lawyer.

17:09.599 --> 17:11.367
Yes, you will. You'll help
me cross this ghost over,

17:11.435 --> 17:13.382
'cause that helps
your client and my son.

17:13.382 --> 17:16.239
Yeah. I'm just helping my client.

17:16.307 --> 17:20.377
In a totally unethical, I could
lose my license sort of way.

17:20.377 --> 17:22.646
Eli, don't you want to
know what else I found out?

17:22.713 --> 17:24.848
Nathan's sister Rachel was
abducted from their home

17:24.915 --> 17:26.415
while their parents were out.

17:26.483 --> 17:27.411
Yeah, Nathan told me.

17:27.411 --> 17:29.832
But he said the killer was
caught and put away for life.

17:29.832 --> 17:31.293
So then why is she haunting him?

17:31.293 --> 17:32.653
Was any of this his fault?

17:32.653 --> 17:34.952
He sure thinks so. He was
supposed to be watching her,

17:34.952 --> 17:36.026
But he didn't check the locks.

17:36.093 --> 17:37.594
And that's how the killer got in.

17:37.662 --> 17:40.187
So maybe she blames him the
same way he blames himself.

17:40.187 --> 17:41.562
She was 9 when she died.

17:41.562 --> 17:43.199
Maybe she's stuck being
mad at her big brother.

17:43.267 --> 17:45.502
Maybe she can't stop punishing him?

17:46.693 --> 17:48.921
Is that why he went to the
morgue, to punish himself?

17:48.921 --> 17:50.874
No, it's more like he couldn't
accept that it happened.

17:50.942 --> 17:52.208
Not till he saw her there.

17:52.276 --> 17:54.218
He's been obsessed with
security ever since.

17:54.218 --> 17:56.846
It probably hasn't helped having a
ghost haunting him all these years.

17:56.914 --> 17:58.715
But lately he says it's
getting a lot worse.

17:58.783 --> 18:00.617
The hauntings or his state of mind?

18:00.685 --> 18:02.586
Both.

18:02.897 --> 18:04.176
Right away, Mr. Weiss.

18:04.898 --> 18:06.056
So you must be Melinda.

18:06.929 --> 18:08.022
Eli here seems to think

18:08.022 --> 18:11.892
you're gonna help me get through
my press conference for my launch.

18:12.897 --> 18:14.664
Yeah, but it's, uh,

18:14.732 --> 18:17.025
Well, it's a non-traditional approach.

18:17.025 --> 18:19.005
For special occasions like yours.

18:19.005 --> 18:21.209
Ok, well, listen,
whatever...whatever it's gonna take.

18:21.209 --> 18:24.007
I mean, my...my anxiety has been so bad

18:24.075 --> 18:25.809
The last couple of months, I
mean, I thought I was gonna have to

18:25.876 --> 18:28.149
quit this business
completely. I mean, uh...

18:28.149 --> 18:31.548
Well, we don't think that it's
work stress that's plaguing you.

18:31.616 --> 18:33.417
See, Melinda has a gift.

18:34.025 --> 18:35.151
And I do, too.

18:35.151 --> 18:36.353
Sort of.

18:36.420 --> 18:37.854
Or half a gift.

18:37.922 --> 18:39.356
Anyway, I...

18:39.423 --> 18:41.277
We can talk to ghosts.

18:41.277 --> 18:42.749
I can see spirits,

18:42.749 --> 18:44.552
And Eli can hear them.

18:45.429 --> 18:47.301
And we think there's a
ghost attached to you,

18:47.301 --> 18:49.399
which would explain your
intruders and the noises,

18:49.467 --> 18:51.601
a lot of things that
have happened to you.

18:52.201 --> 18:54.387
You are asking me to believe

18:54.387 --> 18:57.971
that ghosts can hack mainframes

18:57.971 --> 18:59.911
and corrupt video.

18:59.911 --> 19:02.855
From my experience, they
can do way more than that.

19:03.447 --> 19:05.248
Ok...

19:05.316 --> 19:06.816
So this ghost...

19:06.884 --> 19:08.801
Any ideas who it is?

19:09.695 --> 19:11.755
We think that it's your sister Rachel.

19:15.267 --> 19:17.097
Well, uh, if she's haunting me,

19:17.097 --> 19:18.395
It's because I deserve it.

19:19.398 --> 19:24.002
No. What you deserve is to be
able to make peace with her.

19:24.070 --> 19:25.899
Your safe room...

19:25.899 --> 19:28.830
You said you felt like
someone was in there with you.

19:28.830 --> 19:30.899
Maybe someone was.

19:33.101 --> 19:35.102
That's as clear as the audio gets.

19:35.169 --> 19:36.536
Clear as a buzz saw.

19:36.604 --> 19:39.950
You gotta jack up the sampling
frequency way up. Move over.

19:39.950 --> 19:41.809
That's the pounding we
heard during the session.

19:41.809 --> 19:43.347
Zack and Shane have
been running the tape

19:43.347 --> 19:45.592
trying to identify specifics.

19:45.592 --> 19:47.309
Assuming these are footsteps,

19:47.309 --> 19:50.450
I slowed down the recording to try
and pull out the intruder's gait,

19:50.518 --> 19:53.286
maybe determine a shoe
type or height/weight ratio.

20:04.065 --> 20:05.966
Can you hear me?

20:06.033 --> 20:08.135
Do you know where you are?

20:20.400 --> 20:21.608
Can you, uh,

20:21.608 --> 20:23.550
Could you give us a minute, please?

20:29.257 --> 20:31.224
Your sister, did she die in a hospital?

20:31.292 --> 20:32.859
No. No.

20:32.894 --> 20:36.129
She was found dead in the woods
a couple miles from our house.

20:36.197 --> 20:38.832
What...what does this
have to do with a hospital?

20:39.160 --> 20:42.002
I'm not sure, but I need
you to do me a favor.

20:42.069 --> 20:45.205
Instead of slowing down the
audio, can you speed it up?

20:45.782 --> 20:46.653
Yeah.

21:00.564 --> 21:02.756
I know that sound.

21:02.823 --> 21:05.325
Ok, what does that mean?

21:06.284 --> 21:08.261
I think we've got the wrong ghost.

21:16.733 --> 21:18.706
You never forget that sound.

21:18.706 --> 21:22.343
The first time we ever heard
Aiden's little heart beating.

21:22.343 --> 21:23.615
I thought that's how I remembered it,

21:23.615 --> 21:25.057
But I had to be sure.

21:25.057 --> 21:26.329
What do you mean?

21:26.329 --> 21:28.271
The ghost attached to Eli's new patient,

21:28.271 --> 21:31.266
She's been haunting him with a
double heartbeat like this one.

21:31.334 --> 21:33.902
A baby's, mother's, probably her own.

21:33.970 --> 21:35.355
So the ghost is pregnant?

21:35.355 --> 21:38.736
I think so, in which case she
isn't Nathan's 9-year-old sister.

21:38.736 --> 21:39.811
Well, then who?

21:39.811 --> 21:41.913
I don't know. Something
tells me Nathan should.

21:41.980 --> 21:44.182
I mean, there'd be no reason
to haunt him with her pregnancy

21:44.249 --> 21:46.173
if it wasn't somehow
connected with him, too.

21:46.173 --> 21:48.232
Connected like he's the dad?

21:49.111 --> 21:51.722
Let's hope that narrows the field.

21:53.253 --> 21:54.663
Well, that was pleasant.

21:54.760 --> 21:56.294
You said you
wanted one-on-one.

21:56.361 --> 21:57.695
What did he say?

21:57.763 --> 21:58.963
Nathan's single, 40,

21:59.031 --> 22:00.164
and famously wealthy.

22:00.232 --> 22:01.899
He's been hit with
paternity claims before,

22:01.967 --> 22:03.301
But never by a ghost.

22:03.368 --> 22:05.607
Did he give you any
names or possibilities?

22:05.607 --> 22:07.412
Of the women he's been involved with?

22:07.412 --> 22:09.307
He's gonna email me a list.

22:09.374 --> 22:11.809
My guess, it's gonna
be a very long list.

22:13.245 --> 22:15.813
What, you're surprised
because he's a little geeky?

22:15.881 --> 22:17.315
No. He's a shut-in, right?

22:17.382 --> 22:19.650
I mean, a total workaholic.
How many girls can there be?

22:19.718 --> 22:20.985
We just have to find the one who's dead.

22:21.053 --> 22:22.653
And we are getting close.

22:22.721 --> 22:23.821
Please.

22:23.889 --> 22:24.922
Leave this alone.

22:26.129 --> 22:29.601
Who are you? Why are you here?

22:30.128 --> 22:32.834
He's gotta get out of that house.

22:33.398 --> 22:35.766
Excuse me. You two should move along.

22:35.834 --> 22:37.335
This is a restricted area.

22:37.402 --> 22:38.769
Right.

22:40.806 --> 22:42.896
The ghost said he needs
to get out of the house.

22:42.942 --> 22:45.316
Looks like Nathan was
stepping out plenty.

22:45.383 --> 22:47.051
Yeah, but the ghost
isn't any of these women.

22:47.119 --> 22:48.919
This is the last photo.

22:48.987 --> 22:50.721
It's almost 6 months old.

22:50.789 --> 22:53.383
You know, maybe that's why Nathan
started shutting himself in,

22:53.383 --> 22:55.240
Because he started feeling haunted.

22:55.240 --> 22:56.287
Or maybe he just got tired

22:56.287 --> 22:58.162
of having his every
move being documented.

22:58.230 --> 22:59.330
Not that I'd mind.

22:59.397 --> 23:01.999
Especially if every move was with her.

23:02.067 --> 23:03.000
Or her.

23:03.068 --> 23:04.668
Wait, wait. That's it.

23:04.736 --> 23:06.317
That's it. Whoever the ghost is,

23:06.317 --> 23:07.759
If she were involved with Nathan,

23:07.759 --> 23:09.607
It was probably before
his company took off,

23:09.674 --> 23:11.375
before he was in the public eye.

23:11.443 --> 23:13.344
Back in his garage days.

23:13.411 --> 23:15.197
You know, that's where he
wrote his first program,

23:15.197 --> 23:16.515
His mother's garage.

23:16.515 --> 23:19.416
We should have talked
to his mom, find out.

23:20.113 --> 23:24.021
I'm so sorry that Nathan has
locked himself away again.

23:24.089 --> 23:26.857
I was never able to help him with that.

23:26.925 --> 23:28.893
Maybe you'll have more success.

23:30.023 --> 23:32.487
It's a challenge raising a genius

23:32.487 --> 23:34.265
when you aren't one yourself.

23:34.332 --> 23:36.500
Believe it or not, I can relate.

23:37.260 --> 23:39.126
The doctor said that his habits,

23:39.126 --> 23:41.505
You know, the counting and the knocking,

23:41.573 --> 23:44.308
were all a part of that
and he'd outgrow it.

23:44.376 --> 23:46.200
But I knew different.

23:46.200 --> 23:48.679
He wasn't like that
before his sister died.

23:48.747 --> 23:51.715
It must have been hard on all of you.

23:51.783 --> 23:53.317
Then later...

23:53.385 --> 23:56.053
It was around the time
he graduated college...

23:56.121 --> 23:58.322
I thought, well, maybe
the doctors are right,

23:58.390 --> 24:02.032
because he was a happier
person, for a little while.

24:02.032 --> 24:03.627
Because he met someone special.

24:03.695 --> 24:05.396
He told you about Amy.

24:06.469 --> 24:07.665
Not a lot.

24:07.732 --> 24:09.266
I have a picture.

24:12.299 --> 24:14.138
No, it's here.

24:17.876 --> 24:19.376
There.

24:20.946 --> 24:23.380
This is her. Amy Warner.

24:26.284 --> 24:27.518
They do look happy.

24:27.586 --> 24:30.654
They were. The way he talked about her,

24:30.722 --> 24:33.190
The way he smiled all the time.

24:33.291 --> 24:35.392
I was practically planning the wedding.

24:35.460 --> 24:36.961
But it didn't last.

24:37.028 --> 24:38.809
No, I never knew what happened.

24:38.809 --> 24:40.864
He refused to talk about it.

24:40.932 --> 24:43.867
It's probably the last
time I ever saw him...

24:43.935 --> 24:45.236
Truly happy.

24:45.303 --> 24:46.670
And that was 20 years ago.

24:47.221 --> 24:50.541
After Amy, he just went
back to his first love.

24:50.609 --> 24:51.542
Work.

24:51.610 --> 24:53.043
Yeah. He moved home with us,

24:53.111 --> 24:55.479
Locked himself in the
garage with his computer.

24:55.547 --> 24:58.315
Well, you read the
papers. You know the story.

24:58.383 --> 24:59.717
What about Amy?

24:59.784 --> 25:01.635
Did you keep in touch with her?

25:01.635 --> 25:03.320
That would have been nice.

25:03.388 --> 25:05.055
No, I never saw her again.

25:07.459 --> 25:08.826
Amy Warner died 8 months ago

25:08.893 --> 25:10.861
after a long fight with breast cancer,

25:10.929 --> 25:12.380
And according to a log her
friends and family kept,

25:12.380 --> 25:13.831
It was a bitter fight.

25:13.898 --> 25:14.965
How so?

25:15.033 --> 25:17.334
She sold her house to
pay for her treatments

25:17.402 --> 25:18.727
and still didn't have enough.

25:18.727 --> 25:20.838
The medicine ran out with the money.

25:20.939 --> 25:22.172
That's awful.

25:22.240 --> 25:25.409
But maybe that explains
the hospital vision you had.

25:25.477 --> 25:27.077
She was pregnant in my vision.

25:27.145 --> 25:29.713
And the obit said that she was
survived by a husband and a son,

25:29.781 --> 25:31.048
Garrett.

25:31.116 --> 25:32.716
The child that she was talking about?

25:32.784 --> 25:33.851
A 21-year-old
child.

25:33.918 --> 25:35.707
Nathan started his company 20 years ago

25:35.707 --> 25:37.071
after he split with Amy.

25:37.071 --> 25:38.559
So the math could work.

25:38.559 --> 25:40.124
Nathan could be the biological father,

25:40.191 --> 25:43.000
and Amy could have raised
her son with another man.

25:43.000 --> 25:44.257
Where's Garrett now?

25:44.257 --> 25:45.625
Of course, you're already on that.

25:45.625 --> 25:48.198
He graduated from M.I.T. last spring,

25:48.266 --> 25:49.900
Summa cum laude on a full scholarship.

25:50.364 --> 25:52.583
Microchip off the old block.

25:53.629 --> 25:56.940
Yeah. And brains wouldn't be the
only thing they have in common.

25:57.008 --> 25:59.810
You know, it looks like Garrett shares
Nathan's desire for privacy, too.

25:59.878 --> 26:01.212
I can't find a face page,

26:01.212 --> 26:03.314
A recent blog mention, not even a photo.

26:03.381 --> 26:05.316
What 21-year-old isn't
all over the internet?

26:05.383 --> 26:07.551
One who doesn't want to be found.

26:07.619 --> 26:08.952
Look, I better go.

26:09.020 --> 26:10.626
I have a condo to show in the morning.

26:10.626 --> 26:12.823
Yeah, I gotta get Aiden to bed.

26:12.891 --> 26:14.825
You know, it looks like
he might be stalling.

26:17.062 --> 26:18.562
We got to get you upstairs.

26:18.630 --> 26:20.321
But he needs help.

26:20.321 --> 26:21.363
Who does?

26:21.363 --> 26:23.801
The man in the tiny room.

26:23.868 --> 26:25.636
Uncle Eli's friend?

26:25.704 --> 26:27.838
Who's the other person in the picture?

26:27.906 --> 26:29.106
His little boy.

26:30.094 --> 26:31.775
Aiden, do you know
where his little boy is?

26:31.843 --> 26:33.677
In his daddy's house.

26:33.745 --> 26:35.412
And he's really angry.

26:46.743 --> 26:48.644
So if Nathan's son is
there up at the house,

26:48.711 --> 26:50.012
does that mean he's a ghost, too?

26:50.079 --> 26:52.281
I don't think so. I
couldn't find an obituary

26:52.348 --> 26:53.499
on Garrett Warner

26:53.499 --> 26:55.053
or Garrett Brock, Amy's husband's name.

26:55.053 --> 26:56.885
What about amy's husband? Could
he tell us what's going on?

26:56.953 --> 26:58.287
I tried to call him at his office,

26:58.354 --> 27:00.038
They said he was out of
the country, unreachable.

27:00.038 --> 27:01.790
So for now we have
to go on what we know.

27:01.858 --> 27:04.293
Which is what? We have a
ghost that isn't talking to us,

27:04.360 --> 27:05.961
We don't even know what
their son looks like,

27:06.029 --> 27:08.430
And how did Garrett get
into Nathan's house, anyway?

27:08.498 --> 27:09.713
I practically had a cavity search,

27:09.713 --> 27:11.151
And I'm a shrink.

27:11.151 --> 27:13.954
We know that Garrett just
graduated from M.I.T.,

27:13.954 --> 27:15.205
So what does that tell you?

27:15.205 --> 27:16.505
He's a lot smarter than me.

27:16.572 --> 27:19.808
Everyone who's working in the fortress
is writing software for Nathan.

27:19.876 --> 27:22.533
So an M.I.T. grad would fit right in.

27:22.533 --> 27:23.929
So Nathan's feeling of being watched,

27:23.929 --> 27:25.173
that wasn't just a ghost?

27:25.173 --> 27:26.648
His son is working there.

27:26.716 --> 27:28.784
His angry son, according to Aiden.

27:28.851 --> 27:31.653
What's he angry about? He's
a college grad with a job.

27:31.721 --> 27:33.955
With a millionaire father who
couldn't be bothered enough

27:34.023 --> 27:35.824
to cough up money to save his dying mom.

27:35.892 --> 27:37.229
Well, when you put it like that.

27:37.229 --> 27:38.827
Can you blame him?

27:38.895 --> 27:41.330
He's a boy who just lost his mother.

27:41.330 --> 27:43.332
How could anyone blame him?

27:43.732 --> 27:45.635
Amy, blame him for what?

27:45.635 --> 27:47.336
What is Garrett doing at Nathan's house?

27:47.403 --> 27:48.470
I don't know.

27:48.538 --> 27:49.671
I see him looking at his computer,

27:49.739 --> 27:50.906
but I don't know what he's doing.

27:50.973 --> 27:52.876
You said he needed to
get out of the house.

27:52.876 --> 27:54.191
You meant Garrett, didn't you,

27:54.191 --> 27:55.882
because he's planning
some sort of revenge?

27:55.882 --> 27:58.814
Otherwise, why not just tell
Nathan that Garrett is his son?

27:58.881 --> 28:00.582
Or are you angry at Nathan, too?

28:01.349 --> 28:03.585
I tried keeping them apart.

28:03.653 --> 28:06.021
But it was too late. There's...

28:06.089 --> 28:08.323
There's too much to explain.

28:08.391 --> 28:10.058
But I thought if Nathan stayed
in that room every night...

28:10.126 --> 28:11.360
He'd at least be protected.

28:12.238 --> 28:14.183
You didn't tell him the truth, did you?

28:14.668 --> 28:18.173
That's why he's so angry, because
you never got the chance to explain.

28:20.284 --> 28:23.698
Garrett found his birth certificate
in my things after I died.

28:24.344 --> 28:25.542
But he doesn't know

28:25.542 --> 28:28.278
I never told Nathan he had a son.

28:28.721 --> 28:31.597
He thinks his birth
father chose to neglect us.

28:31.597 --> 28:34.068
Please, just help us with Garrett.

28:34.068 --> 28:35.218
We can talk to him for you.

28:35.218 --> 28:37.907
We can get him to stop
doing what he's planning.

28:39.856 --> 28:41.835
There's no time.

28:45.762 --> 28:47.429
We gotta find that kid.

28:53.522 --> 28:55.268
See anyone who could be his son?

28:55.268 --> 28:57.198
They all look like reporters to me.

28:57.586 --> 28:59.486
Hey, everyone. Welcome
to the press conference.

28:59.708 --> 29:02.197
Your press packets can be
located at the back table.

29:02.197 --> 29:05.645
Just make sure you pick one up
at the end of the conference.

29:07.748 --> 29:09.682
Why didn't she contact me?

29:09.750 --> 29:11.183
I...I would have paid
for her treatments.

29:11.251 --> 29:12.818
I would have spent every dime I had.

29:12.886 --> 29:14.854
That's why we're here.

29:14.921 --> 29:16.288
The reason she didn't contact you...

29:16.356 --> 29:19.191
And I am so sorry for
dumping all this on you...

29:19.259 --> 29:23.663
You have a son, Nathan, with Amy.

29:23.730 --> 29:26.305
She was pregnant when
the two of you broke up.

29:27.067 --> 29:28.534
I have a son?

29:28.602 --> 29:29.702
Are you sure?

29:29.770 --> 29:30.870
His name is Garrett.

29:30.937 --> 29:32.204
He's 21 years old.

29:32.272 --> 29:33.339
We think he's here.

29:33.407 --> 29:35.808
Right here in Grandview?

29:35.876 --> 29:38.778
You might want to take a calming breath.

29:40.547 --> 29:43.488
The employee files are
in that folder there.

29:43.488 --> 29:46.552
Wait a minute. You're sure that
he's working here, in my home?

29:46.620 --> 29:47.861
I've never heard his name.

29:47.861 --> 29:50.476
He's a smart kid. He's probably
not using his real name,

29:50.476 --> 29:52.059
even though it's his stepfather's.

29:52.059 --> 29:54.383
We couldn't find a pic,
but we know his age.

29:54.383 --> 29:56.542
And we have a pretty good idea
of when you might have hired him.

29:56.542 --> 29:58.304
Is there a quick way
to scan recent hires?

29:58.304 --> 29:59.407
He would have applied
after his mother died

29:59.407 --> 30:00.599
in the past 8 months.

30:00.701 --> 30:01.767
Uh, yeah.

30:01.835 --> 30:03.135
15 minutes, Mr. Weiss.

30:03.203 --> 30:05.705
Listen, you're gonna have
to figure out a way to stall.

30:05.772 --> 30:09.041
This is unbelievable. Why would
she not tell me that I have a son?

30:09.109 --> 30:10.824
Here we go. Zack Dorin.

30:10.824 --> 30:13.779
Date of birth lines up with
Garrett's, and you hired him recently.

30:13.847 --> 30:14.914
Wait, we met him.

30:14.981 --> 30:17.059
Yeah, he was analyzing
the security audio.

30:17.059 --> 30:18.019
Do you know where he is right now?

30:18.019 --> 30:19.512
No, I don't. This is unbelievable.

30:19.512 --> 30:22.321
I've got a press conference, people
expecting me to sell software, and...

30:22.389 --> 30:24.659
Ok, I'm gonna go look for him outside.

30:25.416 --> 30:27.008
Wait a minute. Hold on.

30:27.008 --> 30:29.462
If he's here, I will find him.

31:15.526 --> 31:19.419
Nathan Weiss will be about to turn.
Thank you all for your patience.

31:20.064 --> 31:21.580
What does Garret want with me?

31:21.648 --> 31:23.249
I don't know, but whatever it is,

31:23.316 --> 31:25.184
He's been planning it for a long time.

31:25.988 --> 31:27.419
Garrett's confused.

31:27.487 --> 31:29.321
That makes two of us.

31:29.389 --> 31:30.672
He thinks he can hide from me.

31:30.672 --> 31:32.020
He's not thinking clearly.

31:32.020 --> 31:33.697
I can't believe he
slipped right past me.

31:33.697 --> 31:35.432
Well, Garrett obviously
doesn't want to be found.

31:35.432 --> 31:37.255
Yeah, well, people said I was nuts

31:37.255 --> 31:39.598
to wire this whole place for video.

31:39.666 --> 31:40.900
Who's laughing now?

31:40.967 --> 31:42.968
Hopefully not Garrett.

32:03.865 --> 32:05.184
Why can't I find him?

32:05.184 --> 32:07.059
I've got cameras in
virtually every room in the...

32:08.562 --> 32:10.527
except here.

32:11.745 --> 32:14.864
It's all right, it's
ok, it's ok, it's ok.

32:19.525 --> 32:21.307
Come on, come on, come on.

32:21.374 --> 32:22.969
Something's wrong.

32:22.969 --> 32:24.876
That door is offline.

32:25.979 --> 32:28.149
What?

32:28.149 --> 32:30.382
There he is.

32:36.656 --> 32:38.357
Garrett!

32:38.425 --> 32:39.425
Garrett!

32:52.356 --> 32:53.792
Garrett, no.

32:55.018 --> 32:56.652
Garrett, you think you're
hurting your father,

32:56.652 --> 32:58.303
But this will ruin your life.

32:58.303 --> 33:00.253
Time to spread the wealth, Nathan.

33:00.663 --> 33:02.290
Garrett?

33:05.418 --> 33:06.450
Garrett!

33:06.450 --> 33:09.021
Open the door! Come on!

33:09.089 --> 33:11.190
No, no, no, you're not
gonna get a signal in here.

33:11.258 --> 33:12.424
These walls are too thick.

33:12.492 --> 33:15.194
But there's gotta be a
way out of here, right?

33:15.262 --> 33:16.872
He cut the land line, too.

33:23.904 --> 33:25.838
Oh, no.

33:31.144 --> 33:32.311
What is that?

33:32.379 --> 33:33.579
What's happening?

33:33.647 --> 33:36.115
He must have started an electrical
fire when he cut those wires.

33:36.115 --> 33:37.809
That smoke is toxic.

33:37.809 --> 33:39.590
There's gotta be ventilation.

33:39.590 --> 33:41.450
No, that is the ventilation right there.

33:41.450 --> 33:42.681
And if he's cut all those wires,

33:42.681 --> 33:44.757
Then that smoke alarm
is not alerting anyone.

33:44.824 --> 33:47.344
Well, how long until they
start to miss you out there?

33:47.344 --> 33:48.761
Too long.

33:48.828 --> 33:50.562
We'll die in here.

33:58.868 --> 34:01.403
Here! Help me put this
over the vent, all right?

34:02.399 --> 34:03.473
Come on!

34:04.073 --> 34:05.507
Ok.

34:05.541 --> 34:07.676
This is not gonna buy
us enough...enough time.

34:07.743 --> 34:09.377
It doesn't matter. We can't give up.

34:09.445 --> 34:12.128
I never meant for any of this to happen.

34:12.648 --> 34:15.382
What about Garrett? Is this
all just a part of his plan?

34:15.451 --> 34:17.518
Is Amy here? What is he trying to do?

34:17.587 --> 34:20.355
It's some kind of robin hood
plan to get back at Nathan.

34:20.422 --> 34:23.125
I watched him typing. I think
he's leaking Nathan's software

34:23.192 --> 34:24.212
to give away free to everyone.

34:24.212 --> 34:25.951
But he never meant any physical harm.

34:25.951 --> 34:29.159
Well, then help us! Please go find Eli.

34:29.159 --> 34:31.112
Let's go, come on.

34:37.706 --> 34:39.306
Come on, come on.

34:42.911 --> 34:45.407
You gotta go in there. Garrett's inside.

34:45.407 --> 34:47.547
They're trapped in the panic room.

34:49.318 --> 34:50.485
Nathan needs your help!

34:55.409 --> 34:56.327
Garrett!

34:56.543 --> 34:59.287
Get away from there. You're done.

34:59.287 --> 35:00.671
No, wait. I'm trying to help them.

35:00.671 --> 35:03.282
No! He's the only one who
knows how to get Nathan out.

35:03.282 --> 35:04.994
Let him go. He can help.

35:04.994 --> 35:06.861
They need air!

35:07.737 --> 35:09.442
Hurry, Garrett, quick!

35:09.442 --> 35:11.253
I'm trying, I'm trying!

35:22.285 --> 35:24.086
I got it!

35:31.694 --> 35:33.785
You nearly killed us.

35:34.430 --> 35:36.189
What the hell do you think you're doing?

35:36.189 --> 35:37.257
I don't know.

35:38.568 --> 35:39.749
I don't know.

35:39.749 --> 35:41.527
Let's go.

35:50.513 --> 35:52.347
Now, if charges are brought,

35:52.415 --> 35:54.616
what kind of penalties
would he be facing?

35:54.684 --> 35:56.284
None of this should have happened.

35:56.352 --> 35:57.619
If I knew how to stop it...

35:57.687 --> 35:59.711
Well, you could have stopped
it from ever starting.

35:59.711 --> 36:01.723
Why didn't you tell
Nathan you had a child?

36:01.791 --> 36:03.625
Well, it was complicated.

36:03.693 --> 36:06.261
Even I didn't know
about Garrett at first.

36:10.233 --> 36:11.967
I was walking home from work

36:12.034 --> 36:14.202
when I started feeling
lightheaded and weak.

36:14.270 --> 36:17.682
I'd been having a hard
time keeping anything down.

36:17.682 --> 36:19.312
I thought it was a stomach virus.

36:19.312 --> 36:20.623
Then I collapsed.

36:22.080 --> 36:24.081
Someone got me to the hospital.

36:24.149 --> 36:25.082
Can you hear me?

36:25.150 --> 36:26.917
Do you know where you are?

36:26.985 --> 36:29.086
The doctor said I was
severely dehydrated...

36:32.324 --> 36:34.058
And that I was pregnant.

36:34.126 --> 36:35.693
You were running, and
the next thing you knew,

36:35.761 --> 36:37.361
You were hearing your baby's
heartbeat on the monitor.

36:37.429 --> 36:39.063
Why didn't you share
any of this with Nathan?

36:39.131 --> 36:40.598
I planned to, but by the time

36:40.665 --> 36:42.733
I got home to our
apartment, Nathan was gone.

36:42.801 --> 36:45.059
He'd packed up his stuff and moved out.

36:45.059 --> 36:46.065
Why?

36:46.689 --> 36:48.506
You'd have to ask him that.

36:54.980 --> 36:56.547
All right, I'm gonna
post Garrett's bail,

36:56.615 --> 36:58.549
My lawyer will represent him.

36:58.617 --> 37:00.051
But whatever happens next

37:00.118 --> 37:01.585
is out of my control.

37:01.653 --> 37:03.819
We all need to talk.

37:07.292 --> 37:09.427
Of course I remember that night.

37:09.494 --> 37:10.865
What I still don't understand

37:10.865 --> 37:12.930
is why she didn't call me,

37:13.445 --> 37:15.599
Tell me that she was in the hospital.

37:15.667 --> 37:17.137
Would you even have been there?

37:17.137 --> 37:20.333
Were you already gone? You left me.

37:20.333 --> 37:23.045
Nathan, first you have to
tell Amy why you left her.

37:24.142 --> 37:26.710
I tried to call her office that night,

37:26.778 --> 37:30.012
and they said that she had been
gone from work for quite a while.

37:31.650 --> 37:35.075
And, uh, many hours later,
Amy still wasn't home.

37:35.075 --> 37:36.802
It wasn't like her not to call.

37:37.155 --> 37:39.636
So I panicked.

37:39.816 --> 37:41.522
I started calling her friends,

37:41.522 --> 37:44.142
I called the police, I
even called the morgue.

37:44.896 --> 37:47.431
And I kept having this
part of me that was saying,

37:47.499 --> 37:49.733
Don't worry, everything's gonna be ok,

37:49.801 --> 37:51.706
There's gotta be a good
explanation for this.

37:51.706 --> 37:54.478
But there was this other part.

37:54.478 --> 37:57.956
That lived in fear, ever
since your sister went missing.

37:57.956 --> 38:01.939
And I thought, I never want
to go through that again.

38:02.514 --> 38:04.281
I'll never go through that again.

38:04.977 --> 38:08.021
I...I called him at work the
next day and tried to talk,

38:08.021 --> 38:09.529
but before I could
even get a word out...

38:09.529 --> 38:11.132
She's saying that she tried to explain.

38:11.132 --> 38:12.361
No, I wouldn't let her.

38:12.361 --> 38:14.700
No, I told her that we were done

38:14.700 --> 38:17.262
and that there was nothing left.

38:18.488 --> 38:20.470
But clearly there was.

38:21.133 --> 38:22.391
A lot.

38:22.901 --> 38:24.602
And I missed it all,

38:24.669 --> 38:27.771
Trying to protect
myself, trying to be safe.

38:28.628 --> 38:30.241
There's nothing safe about love.

38:30.308 --> 38:32.343
What can I say? I'm
an emotional cripple.

38:32.410 --> 38:34.445
I'm not fit to hold on to anyone.

38:34.513 --> 38:37.148
He thinks he's so good
at shutting himself off.

38:37.215 --> 38:38.415
He's not.

38:38.483 --> 38:40.877
Just look at his pass code.

38:41.361 --> 38:42.753
Amy doesn't believe that.

38:43.430 --> 38:44.552
Neither do I.

38:44.552 --> 38:46.991
When we were locked in,
I saw your security code.

38:47.058 --> 38:48.626
I saw it, too.

38:48.693 --> 38:50.327
It's November.

38:50.596 --> 38:52.030
The month you broke up.

38:52.063 --> 38:54.598
How can you say that you're
not fit to hold on to anyone?

38:54.666 --> 38:56.433
You've been holding on
to her this whole time.

38:56.501 --> 39:00.271
If he could just understand what
Garrett was really trying to do in there.

39:01.058 --> 39:05.009
She wants you to tell Nathan the
real reason you came to see him.

39:07.546 --> 39:10.481
When I found out that he was my father,

39:10.549 --> 39:11.949
I read all about him.

39:12.017 --> 39:14.018
I saw pictures.

39:14.085 --> 39:16.020
I looked in the mirror.

39:16.087 --> 39:18.889
Is this his chin?

39:18.957 --> 39:21.125
Are these his eyes?

39:21.193 --> 39:25.812
You know, what parts
of me came from him?

39:26.031 --> 39:28.165
And would he recognize it?

39:28.200 --> 39:30.834
They're alike in other ways, too.

39:30.902 --> 39:32.369
They're so smart,

39:32.437 --> 39:34.471
Ambitious,

39:34.539 --> 39:36.473
Generous.

39:36.541 --> 39:39.944
She says you're like your
father in all the best ways.

39:40.011 --> 39:41.999
You're both very generous.

39:41.999 --> 39:44.415
That's not what I thought at the time.

39:44.548 --> 39:48.548
I read that Nathan wanted his first
software program to be open source.

39:48.548 --> 39:50.499
Free to everyone.

39:51.089 --> 39:54.892
Since mom died because she
couldn't afford her medicine...

39:54.960 --> 39:57.027
I guess it seemed kind of poetic.

39:58.089 --> 40:00.991
Make him pay by giving away something

40:00.991 --> 40:03.767
that he thought should have been
given away in the first place.

40:05.770 --> 40:06.904
That's right.

40:08.261 --> 40:09.607
You're right.

40:09.674 --> 40:10.908
I sold out.

40:12.077 --> 40:13.711
I got a lot of homes

40:13.778 --> 40:15.779
and nice toys...

40:16.645 --> 40:18.048
Not much else.

40:18.468 --> 40:20.522
I think amy's hoping

40:20.522 --> 40:23.287
now that you'll realize you
have much more than that.

40:23.355 --> 40:25.389
You know, every once in a while,

40:25.457 --> 40:28.792
I hire someone who reminds me of me.

40:28.860 --> 40:32.062
I see this kid who is smart

40:32.130 --> 40:34.198
And driven.

40:34.266 --> 40:36.834
And, yes, a bit pigheaded.

40:38.536 --> 40:43.407
It's usually mixed feelings,
having yourself mirrored back.

40:45.176 --> 40:47.745
But not this time.

40:54.286 --> 40:58.255
Will you tell Nathan I'm sorry
I never trusted his heart?

40:58.323 --> 41:00.190
But I do now.

41:00.258 --> 41:01.592
I will.

41:04.496 --> 41:06.130
And tell Garrett goodbye.

41:06.197 --> 41:09.066
And that I love him.

41:39.479 --> 41:41.065
Green.

41:41.935 --> 41:43.105
I'm home.

41:43.105 --> 41:45.002
Just in time to tuck someone in bed.

41:45.070 --> 41:46.871
I come bearing gifts, huh?

41:47.223 --> 41:48.825
One for you...

41:48.992 --> 41:51.185
I've got something great for you.

41:52.043 --> 41:52.913
Cool!

41:53.553 --> 41:55.279
Doctors use it

41:55.380 --> 41:57.247
to look into people's eyes.

41:57.315 --> 41:58.782
Look, I know it's not flash,

41:58.850 --> 42:01.018
But if you have trouble sleeping...

42:01.086 --> 42:02.653
I don't need flash to sleep anymore.

42:02.721 --> 42:04.321
Really? No more being afraid?

42:04.389 --> 42:07.191
Nope. But they're gonna love this.

42:10.225 --> 42:11.762
They?

42:20.441 --> 42:22.349
Where did all that come from?

42:23.009 --> 42:25.609
They like to move stuff around.

42:26.217 --> 42:27.444
Look.

42:27.512 --> 42:28.903
They found flash.

42:28.903 --> 42:31.115
They who? Aiden, who
are you talking about?

42:31.182 --> 42:32.182
My friends.

42:32.250 --> 42:34.385
Your friends.

42:34.452 --> 42:35.619
Are they here now?

42:35.687 --> 42:37.121
They were here a second ago.

42:37.188 --> 42:39.390
I thought you could see them.

42:39.457 --> 42:40.724
No. No, I haven't.

42:40.792 --> 42:42.559
Are they ghosts?

42:43.285 --> 42:44.862
No. They're different.

42:44.929 --> 42:45.863
Different.

42:45.930 --> 42:47.664
How are they different, buddy? Tell us.

42:47.732 --> 42:51.301
Well, they like this
stuff because it's shiny,

42:51.301 --> 42:52.393
Like them.

42:53.001 --> 42:55.406
Can I give them some paper clips?

42:55.939 --> 42:56.767
Yeah.

42:56.767 --> 42:59.743
Sure, sport. My desk, center drawer.

43:02.680 --> 43:03.747
They're shiny?

43:03.815 --> 43:04.882
Not ghosts.

43:05.493 --> 43:08.225
Maybe they're just
imaginary friends, huh?

43:10.269 --> 43:11.998
Honey, what's going on?

43:13.108 --> 43:14.854
I don't know.
