01:38.750 --> 01:40.707
It's a story about animals.

01:41.916 --> 01:44.749
The story took place in a barren land.

01:45.833 --> 01:48.082
I hate to bring up about animals...

01:48.750 --> 01:50.665
...but one of my high school teacher...

01:50.833 --> 01:53.074
...always loved about telling
a story on ancient monkeys.

01:53.791 --> 01:55.291
He said there were two monkeys...

01:55.458 --> 01:56.749
...in order not to be eaten by tigers...

01:56.916 --> 01:58.040
...while they are picking up peaches,

01:58.208 --> 01:59.708
they decided to cooperate.

02:00.500 --> 02:02.665
First monkey would go up and pick,

02:03.083 --> 02:05.043
the second monkey looks
out for the first monkey.

02:06.000 --> 02:08.499
In return, the first monkey would
give half of the food to the second monkey.

02:08.791 --> 02:11.332
However, the sentry monkey
could never leave it's duty.

02:12.375 --> 02:13.655
It requires those two monkeys...

02:13.750 --> 02:15.351
...should never only think about itself.

02:15.833 --> 02:16.833
As a result,

02:17.291 --> 02:19.332
those two monkeys become
a group of monkeys.

02:19.791 --> 02:22.499
This group of monkeys become human beings.

02:23.208 --> 02:27.249
Our story starts with this bird.

04:36.083 --> 04:37.083
Ay!

04:37.125 --> 04:38.625
Give me a cigarette.

04:49.041 --> 04:50.832
Do you know Muhammad?

04:51.000 --> 04:52.124
He's an Arabian prince.

04:52.333 --> 04:54.415
I hunted this falcon for him.

04:54.583 --> 04:56.083
Cost him a million RMB.

04:56.166 --> 04:57.749
See, you take half of the money...

04:57.916 --> 04:59.416
...and let me go with the other half.

04:59.458 --> 05:00.958
Sounds good?

05:09.875 --> 05:10.875
Ok, never mind.

05:10.916 --> 05:12.874
It's all yours if you're letting me go.

05:16.875 --> 05:17.957
Keep talking.

05:18.375 --> 05:20.915
Hello. Do you hear things?

05:22.083 --> 05:23.583
Hello!

05:24.375 --> 05:25.875
You are good person,

05:25.916 --> 05:28.415
but good things don't always
happen to good people!

05:28.916 --> 05:30.416
Hey!

06:41.000 --> 06:42.500
Are you nuts?

06:43.458 --> 06:46.124
You almost ran me over!

06:49.458 --> 06:51.874
Brain-dead asshole.

06:53.208 --> 06:55.457
I tried to reason with him.

06:56.666 --> 06:59.082
Hey, say something!

06:59.916 --> 07:01.416
Hey.

07:02.458 --> 07:06.624
Is there anyone?

07:07.416 --> 07:08.916
Hey, what's going on?

07:18.458 --> 07:19.958
We're fucked...

07:20.416 --> 07:21.415
...there's only one road out...

07:21.583 --> 07:22.165
...and both sides are gonna be blocked.

07:22.333 --> 07:23.833
We can't run out of this.

07:26.208 --> 07:29.040
Take the falcon and just go.
I'll call the police.

07:55.208 --> 07:57.624
When I become a lawyer,

07:57.791 --> 08:00.374
I recall the monkey story.

08:01.250 --> 08:03.832
And I just want to tell my teacher,

08:04.250 --> 08:06.165
humans are not really humans...

08:06.333 --> 08:08.040
...until they learned to use fire,

08:08.500 --> 08:10.540
not because they abandoned selfishness.

08:10.708 --> 08:12.208
Hey! Come here!

08:12.875 --> 08:14.375
The car is broken!

08:14.833 --> 08:16.374
Hey hey hey, let's go!

08:43.416 --> 08:44.916
Hi, greeting!

08:56.166 --> 08:57.166
Hello.

08:57.416 --> 08:58.916
I'm Pan Xiao.

09:00.000 --> 09:01.500
We've spoken on the phone.

09:02.916 --> 09:05.249
I pretty much understand your situations.

09:06.000 --> 09:07.720
There are two more questions I need to ask.

09:07.875 --> 09:10.415
Do you think you could handle this?

09:13.208 --> 09:14.374
There are two things I'd like to mention.

09:14.583 --> 09:17.540
First of all, I took ten
hours train to here.

09:19.166 --> 09:21.790
But what I didn't know is to arrive here, I
have to take another 3 hours horse carriage.

09:21.958 --> 09:23.207
I am not asking for money,

09:23.375 --> 09:24.999
I am talking about opportunity cost.

09:25.458 --> 09:26.790
We can always earn more money,

09:26.958 --> 09:29.124
but when times gone, they're gone forever.

09:30.500 --> 09:32.832
Do you think you could handle this?

09:34.458 --> 09:36.332
Please, listen to me first.

09:37.291 --> 09:38.791
Consider this a new habit,

09:38.875 --> 09:40.995
because we're gonna do the
exactly thing on court. OK?

09:44.458 --> 09:45.958
Secondly,

09:46.166 --> 09:48.790
your case is kind of complicated.

09:49.208 --> 09:50.874
I can't know for sure that we could win.

09:51.226 --> 09:52.226
Therefore,

09:52.250 --> 09:54.091
the payment of the remaining
fund is important.

09:54.416 --> 09:55.916
It seems you can handle this.

09:56.000 --> 09:59.499
When I am going back, I am not gonna
take horse carriage anymore right?

10:00.541 --> 10:02.041
I never loved animals.

10:03.000 --> 10:04.500
I especially hate horses.

10:22.083 --> 10:23.665
It's clear what happened.

10:23.833 --> 10:25.165
The defendant murdered a police officer...

10:25.333 --> 10:26.833
...while poaching protected birds.

10:27.125 --> 10:28.625
The prosecution rests.

10:28.708 --> 10:30.208
Will the defense please begin?

10:31.458 --> 10:32.958
Thank you, Your Honor.

10:33.500 --> 10:35.165
We don't hear a single word...

10:35.333 --> 10:37.124
...from my defendant on this tape.

10:37.291 --> 10:39.124
So, I don't understand what
this so-called evidence...

10:39.291 --> 10:40.791
...has to do with my client.

10:40.958 --> 10:41.624
I'll show you!

10:41.791 --> 10:43.540
Altai falcon feathers were in the vehicle.

10:43.708 --> 10:44.415
I suspect...

10:44.583 --> 10:46.624
You say you "suspect" you "think"...

10:46.791 --> 10:47.290
...but that's not enough.

10:47.458 --> 10:48.999
The law requires proof.

10:49.166 --> 10:53.582
What you're providing are clues, not proof.

10:53.750 --> 10:55.457
Let me demonstrate "proof".

10:56.833 --> 10:58.333
Officer Wang,

10:59.041 --> 11:00.832
on the day of the crime,

11:01.000 --> 11:02.915
did you have lunch with the victim?

11:03.333 --> 11:04.333
Yes.

11:04.750 --> 11:06.415
Did you consume alcohol?

11:10.125 --> 11:11.625
I don't remember.

11:12.541 --> 11:13.541
I present to the court...

11:13.625 --> 11:15.290
...the receipt for the meal.

11:15.458 --> 11:20.040
Officer Wang ate with the
victim at Dafudi restaurant.

11:20.250 --> 11:21.750
It has your signature.

11:21.791 --> 11:23.291
Thank you.

11:25.250 --> 11:26.957
You ordered roasted lamb...

11:27.125 --> 11:28.707
...one bottle of Songzhuang liquor,

11:28.875 --> 11:29.999
and four bottles of beer.

11:30.166 --> 11:31.415
Quite a lot of alcohol.

11:31.625 --> 11:33.582
So, we can only conclude...

11:33.750 --> 11:35.270
...that your consumption of alcohol...

11:35.333 --> 11:39.040
...was the direct cause of this accident.

11:39.250 --> 11:40.790
And Officer Wang, frankly,

11:41.166 --> 11:43.082
you're an indirect cause of this tragedy.

11:43.500 --> 11:44.500
Say that again!

11:44.791 --> 11:46.832
You know very well what happened that day!

11:47.000 --> 11:48.582
I've had enough of your bullshit!

11:49.958 --> 11:51.499
Objection! Your honor.

11:51.666 --> 11:53.166
This is personal attack!

12:00.416 --> 12:02.457
You're a good lawyer,

12:04.416 --> 12:06.374
and a friend I'd like to make.

12:07.291 --> 12:08.291
I'm sorry,

12:08.333 --> 12:10.249
my liver has some functional disorder.

12:10.666 --> 12:11.666
That's why I don't drink.

12:12.125 --> 12:14.045
If you're satisfied with
the results of the case,

12:14.500 --> 12:15.861
let's make the best of our time...

12:15.958 --> 12:16.665
Well, let's wrap this up.

12:16.833 --> 12:18.333
I'll wire the rest of your money...

12:19.541 --> 12:23.332
...into your account within ten days.

12:30.958 --> 12:32.999
C'mon, you shouldn't screw with lawyers.

12:34.250 --> 12:35.750
It's ten days.

12:37.250 --> 12:39.999
Do you know how much
effective time people have in their lives?

12:40.583 --> 12:43.374
Outside of sleeping,
eating, and bullshitting,

12:43.541 --> 12:45.374
It comes out to a little
over 100,000 hours.

12:46.708 --> 12:48.415
And you actually want me to wait 10 days.

12:53.291 --> 12:54.791
That car.

12:55.791 --> 12:57.291
Do you see it?

12:58.958 --> 13:00.540
It's a little too red, isn't it?

13:00.750 --> 13:02.415
My wife liked it.

13:03.000 --> 13:04.540
I went away on business this year...

13:05.500 --> 13:07.332
...and when I came back,

13:07.916 --> 13:09.416
I heard she'd had an accident.

13:09.791 --> 13:11.415
Carbon monoxide poisoning.

13:12.333 --> 13:14.290
But I bought the color anyway.

13:14.750 --> 13:16.874
Because I promised her I would.

13:17.166 --> 13:18.790
So, rest assured.

13:19.208 --> 13:20.708
People like me...

13:20.916 --> 13:22.416
...intend to keep the promises.

13:26.250 --> 13:27.750
How much is your car worth?

13:30.541 --> 13:32.421
It seems your wife doesn't
need it anymore huh?

13:32.958 --> 13:35.040
So you should leave me
the car as collateral.

13:46.958 --> 13:48.458
You can't have...

13:50.208 --> 13:51.708
...the car.

13:52.083 --> 13:53.583
Really?

14:03.500 --> 14:05.000
Look here.

14:05.791 --> 14:07.540
I've signed this receipt.

14:08.416 --> 14:09.916
It proves that

14:10.041 --> 14:11.541
I bought this bottle of alcohol.

14:12.083 --> 14:13.583
But who can tell...

14:13.625 --> 14:15.145
...that I actually have been drinking?

15:08.083 --> 15:09.583
So.

15:10.500 --> 15:12.082
You really want the car huh?

15:14.583 --> 15:16.083
Here. Sign.

15:52.708 --> 15:54.208
Do you believe...

15:54.916 --> 15:56.416
...I ran into that police car...

15:57.000 --> 15:58.540
...intentionally?

16:00.333 --> 16:01.833
Or not?

16:17.250 --> 16:18.750
Sorry.

16:21.875 --> 16:23.635
That's outside of my
professional competence.

16:27.375 --> 16:28.875
You're a good lawyer.

16:31.833 --> 16:39.833
Thank you.

17:02.833 --> 17:04.333
Hey, pal!

17:04.458 --> 17:06.707
There's only one road out
of this place, right?

17:12.500 --> 17:14.000
That's what it looks like.

17:39.208 --> 17:40.708
I need to see your license.

17:47.458 --> 17:48.958
Name?

17:49.708 --> 17:51.208
Pan Xiao.

17:53.875 --> 17:55.375
Occupation?

17:57.375 --> 17:58.540
I thought you knew?

17:58.708 --> 18:00.208
Answer the question!

18:02.208 --> 18:03.708
Lawyer.

18:03.833 --> 18:05.333
Can I go?

18:16.458 --> 18:18.040
You only lost a conviction.

18:18.291 --> 18:19.791
Is it worth the anger?

18:19.916 --> 18:20.999
I swear to god...

18:21.166 --> 18:23.165
...if I weren't a cop, I'd kick your ass.

18:24.041 --> 18:25.541
Too bad you're a cop.

18:27.375 --> 18:28.875
Thank you sir.

18:29.500 --> 18:31.000
What the fuck are you?

18:46.958 --> 18:48.458
The merchandise is on the move.

18:49.208 --> 18:50.708
We can't afford another delay.

18:52.208 --> 18:53.208
Think of something.

18:53.375 --> 18:54.875
I know.

19:30.583 --> 19:31.583
Hi, Michael.

19:32.000 --> 19:33.790
- It's me.
- Mr. Pan.

19:33.958 --> 19:37.707
- We're gonna make a big scene tomorrow.
- Not a problem!

19:37.875 --> 19:38.832
Have you invited media for
the book release tomorrow?

19:39.000 --> 19:40.582
Yes, more than 30 of them.

19:40.750 --> 19:41.457
Well, invite more.

19:41.666 --> 19:43.907
- The more the better.
- The costs' gonna be much higher!

19:44.166 --> 19:45.666
We gotta take this big.

19:45.791 --> 19:46.957
Fame and fortune are two related brothers.

19:47.125 --> 19:48.457
Fame brings fortune...

19:48.625 --> 19:50.466
...and you can't buy fame
without the fortune!

19:50.875 --> 19:52.999
The second thing is write
up something for the press.

19:53.166 --> 19:53.957
What's it gonna be?

19:54.125 --> 19:54.790
You don't even know this?

19:54.958 --> 19:55.624
Ay ya!

19:55.791 --> 19:57.632
Famous lawyer went to a
distant border area...

19:57.833 --> 19:59.915
...and won justice for a
wrongly accused man.

20:00.083 --> 20:01.083
What about the content?

20:01.250 --> 20:02.250
Our legal wire reports...

20:02.333 --> 20:03.082
...not long ago...

20:03.250 --> 20:04.415
...our journalist...

20:04.583 --> 20:06.623
...has had accompanied with
famous lawyer Pan Xiao,

20:06.625 --> 20:07.915
whose English name is Sean Pan,

20:08.083 --> 20:10.123
been to the no man's land
in Northwest rural China.

20:10.541 --> 20:13.082
Hello?

20:48.291 --> 20:49.791
Get down here!

20:51.250 --> 20:52.750
Get down here now!

21:04.250 --> 21:05.750
Wipe it off!

21:14.958 --> 21:16.458
Can't talk to you!

21:20.166 --> 21:21.666
I forgive you this time.

21:24.875 --> 21:26.955
That's gonna be the most
expensive slap of your life.

21:36.375 --> 21:37.875
What are you doing?

21:38.875 --> 21:40.375
Hey, get back in the truck...

21:41.976 --> 21:42.976
...both of you!

21:43.000 --> 21:44.500
You hear me?

21:50.708 --> 21:52.208
What are you doing?

21:53.916 --> 21:55.082
Hey! Hey!

21:55.250 --> 21:56.750
"Hey"what, boy? "Hey" what?

21:58.500 --> 22:00.790
C'mon, sanitation! You
can't just pee anywhere!

22:07.083 --> 22:08.083
Hey, buddy, this time...

22:08.416 --> 22:09.999
...we'll let you off.

22:55.916 --> 22:57.416
Pieces of shit...

23:43.000 --> 23:44.500
Fuck you!

24:31.375 --> 24:32.875
I'll let you off this time!

24:32.958 --> 24:34.458
Hurry up!

25:33.458 --> 25:38.165
Ay!

25:38.666 --> 25:40.166
Hey.

25:44.083 --> 25:45.583
Ouch.

26:47.916 --> 26:49.790
Are you fucking blind?

27:05.583 --> 27:06.874
What's the matter?

27:07.041 --> 27:09.165
Hey, comrade. Hey, are you cold?

27:09.333 --> 27:10.833
I'll close the windows.

27:11.000 --> 27:12.500
Calm down. Deep breaths.

27:22.291 --> 27:23.451
There's a rest area up ahead.

27:23.500 --> 27:23.999
There'll be people.

27:24.500 --> 27:26.000
You'll be alright. We'll be alright.

27:26.916 --> 27:28.416
Hey, pal?

27:28.625 --> 27:29.625
Buddy?

27:30.000 --> 27:31.500
Ay.

31:49.000 --> 31:50.790
I need to make a phone call.

34:11.333 --> 34:12.833
Boss, fill it up.

34:17.833 --> 34:19.333
Need me to fix your car?

34:20.458 --> 34:21.958
No, just fill it up.

34:23.416 --> 34:25.790
You sure? Your car ain't
looking good to me.

34:26.791 --> 34:27.791
No repairs. Thanks.

34:27.875 --> 34:29.375
How much?

34:29.750 --> 34:31.250
One thousand five hundred yuan.

34:34.208 --> 34:35.208
How much?!

34:35.625 --> 34:37.125
One thousand five hundred yuan.

34:39.000 --> 34:40.706
It's just a tank of gas.

34:41.166 --> 34:42.331
Really.

34:42.500 --> 34:44.000
One thousand five hundred yuan.

34:44.666 --> 34:45.666
Man.

34:46.000 --> 34:48.248
Don't you think that's a little overpriced?

34:49.333 --> 34:51.206
There's another gas station down the road.

34:51.500 --> 34:54.040
Four hundred and ten kilometers that way,
you can't miss it.

34:58.916 --> 35:01.624
So, pal, what you're
doing here is extortion.

35:04.208 --> 35:05.708
Extortion?

35:06.041 --> 35:07.790
We don't like that word around here.

35:08.583 --> 35:10.124
What we do is affiliated marketing.

35:10.291 --> 35:11.791
You understand?

35:12.208 --> 35:13.708
What?

35:14.125 --> 35:15.165
Our rule is...

35:15.541 --> 35:16.541
...before you buy gas,

35:17.041 --> 35:19.040
we have a little dance show...

35:20.375 --> 35:21.875
...that you go in there and watch,

35:21.916 --> 35:23.416
it's pretty sexy.

35:23.916 --> 35:26.540
The show is 1,200, gas is 300.

35:27.250 --> 35:29.957
I'd say 300 a tank is reasonable.
Wouldn't you?

35:33.291 --> 35:34.791
OK. Fine.

35:35.041 --> 35:36.541
One thousand five hundred yuan, then.

35:37.083 --> 35:38.583
But I don't need to see the show.

35:39.583 --> 35:41.624
No show, no gas.

35:42.166 --> 35:43.707
Otherwise I'd just be...

35:44.041 --> 35:46.290
...ripping people off.

35:47.166 --> 35:48.915
You get in there and have your fun.

35:49.375 --> 35:50.957
You'll be smiling when you come out.

35:51.125 --> 35:52.625
Right?

35:55.875 --> 35:56.875
Just go.

35:57.208 --> 35:58.708
Don't be surprised!

36:01.083 --> 36:02.583
Ok.

36:04.666 --> 36:05.666
I'll go in.

36:06.083 --> 36:07.583
I'm going in.

36:08.250 --> 36:09.250
Hey,

36:09.416 --> 36:10.416
Zit.

36:10.500 --> 36:12.000
Fill it up.

36:27.708 --> 36:29.208
Come on.

36:35.291 --> 36:36.791
Hey!

36:38.250 --> 36:39.750
Hey! Hey!

36:39.767 --> 36:40.767
Hmm.

36:40.791 --> 36:41.249
What are you doing?

36:41.541 --> 36:43.041
What am I doing?

36:44.500 --> 36:46.000
You actually want to see the show?

36:47.291 --> 36:50.540
Fine, then that's an extra 100.

37:19.958 --> 37:27.958
Stop it!

37:39.000 --> 37:40.500
Could you please stop it!

37:45.500 --> 37:47.000
I'm sorry.

37:50.708 --> 37:52.208
You don't need to do anything.

37:53.000 --> 37:54.500
Here's 200, Ok? Take it.

37:56.625 --> 37:58.125
I just came to get gas,

37:59.041 --> 38:00.541
I need to go.

38:07.541 --> 38:10.249
Come on, put on your clothes.

38:12.708 --> 38:14.208
Go, go sit over there.

38:25.791 --> 38:27.332
- Mister...
- What?

38:27.500 --> 38:28.500
Mister, y'know.

38:28.625 --> 38:30.249
This is my first time turning tricks.

38:30.416 --> 38:31.916
If I don't the boss beats me.

38:32.041 --> 38:33.281
Mister, please don't arrest me.

38:33.416 --> 38:34.456
I'm telling you the truth.

38:34.708 --> 38:35.948
Cross my heart and hope to die.

38:36.041 --> 38:36.790
I'm not a cop,

38:36.958 --> 38:37.958
now get up.

38:38.375 --> 38:39.875
You're not a cop?!

38:41.875 --> 38:43.395
Then what the hell are you looking at?

38:43.625 --> 38:45.125
I'm watching my car, Ok?

38:46.708 --> 38:48.909
If you people didn't do this
"captive market" thing...

38:48.916 --> 38:50.416
I wouldn't be here at all.

38:58.083 --> 38:59.583
So, handsome.

38:59.958 --> 39:01.458
Where are you going, anyway?

39:03.416 --> 39:04.916
Home.

39:09.208 --> 39:10.790
Did you like my dancing just now?

39:15.833 --> 39:17.333
I'm telling you the truth.

39:18.000 --> 39:19.500
I used to be in that...

39:19.750 --> 39:21.582
...that Shanxi Art Academy.

39:24.291 --> 39:26.124
Really. Do you believe me?

39:26.291 --> 39:27.791
Look,

39:29.000 --> 39:30.500
look! And look!

39:30.750 --> 39:32.707
Get up!

39:32.875 --> 39:33.999
Do you know how I got here?

39:34.250 --> 39:35.499
They lied to me...

39:35.666 --> 39:37.166
Get up, get up!

39:37.500 --> 39:39.000
Mister...

39:41.291 --> 39:42.791
...help me, Ok?

39:43.416 --> 39:44.916
Take me with you.

39:50.375 --> 39:52.124
Just help me out, Ok?

39:55.541 --> 39:57.165
I'll give you 100, take it.

39:57.333 --> 39:59.124
- What are you doing?
- It's my fare.

40:00.083 --> 40:03.290
- Don't be polite, Take it.
- Why..why are you giving me money?

40:03.583 --> 40:05.707
This is your money. This is your tip.

40:05.875 --> 40:07.540
- Keep it, I can't help you.
- Don't be like this sir.

40:07.708 --> 40:09.208
- Just take it!
- I can't help you!

40:09.250 --> 40:10.750
I...

40:24.333 --> 40:25.333
So what'd she say?

40:25.750 --> 40:29.207
Was she an artis or a
ball player this time?

40:34.333 --> 40:35.853
Damn little bitch you wanna run again?

40:36.833 --> 40:37.833
You can't run with...

40:38.166 --> 40:39.166
...broken legs!

40:39.250 --> 40:40.750
You wanna run...

40:43.291 --> 40:44.791
Hey, look, just talk to her, Ok?

40:44.833 --> 40:46.333
Don't hit women.

40:47.583 --> 40:49.207
I'll deal with you in a second!

40:51.666 --> 40:53.166
Here, 1,500.

40:53.333 --> 40:54.833
That's not enough.

41:02.208 --> 41:04.207
Get this off my car, I don't want it!

41:04.833 --> 41:06.333
Get off! I don't want it!

41:06.458 --> 41:08.790
It's cold, you'll freeze
to death without glass.

41:09.500 --> 41:11.249
I didn't tell you to fix my car!

41:12.375 --> 41:14.415
Hey, Zit, fix the headlight too!

41:17.916 --> 41:19.540
Hey, no!

41:19.708 --> 41:20.708
No!

41:21.041 --> 41:22.665
Don't fix my car,

41:22.833 --> 41:24.333
don't, don't!

41:29.541 --> 41:30.624
Fine.

41:30.875 --> 41:31.915
Forget the headlights.

41:32.250 --> 41:33.750
Three thousand yuan.

41:45.291 --> 41:46.791
What a guy.

44:43.541 --> 44:44.541
Don't leave no trace.

44:44.791 --> 44:47.082
God bless me, God bless me.

46:01.166 --> 46:02.166
Hey, boss.

46:02.666 --> 46:04.166
Fill me up.

46:04.625 --> 46:06.125
Here, 1500.

46:07.416 --> 46:08.916
It's 1,500 for the gas, alright?

46:09.750 --> 46:11.250
My gas line leaks, Ok?

46:14.083 --> 46:15.583
Take it!

46:20.375 --> 46:22.124
So you like her, huh?

46:23.166 --> 46:24.666
Zit,

46:24.791 --> 46:26.291
give him some gas!

46:34.041 --> 46:35.541
A lighter.

46:42.500 --> 46:44.000
One hundred yuan.

46:50.791 --> 46:52.291
Wait a minute...

46:52.333 --> 46:54.249
...you still owe me 50.

46:55.208 --> 46:56.708
What 50?

46:56.791 --> 46:58.291
So I don't say anything.

47:15.750 --> 47:17.250
Look,

47:17.375 --> 47:19.540
all I have.

47:20.041 --> 47:21.541
Keep it secret.

47:27.125 --> 47:28.749
Nobody hears about you and the girl.

47:28.916 --> 47:30.416
I won't say a word.

47:35.291 --> 47:36.791
Thank you. Thank you very much!

47:40.208 --> 47:41.708
You're such a wonderful person.

47:54.666 --> 47:56.166
I said I let you off,

47:56.291 --> 47:57.915
and then you burned my truck.

47:59.833 --> 48:00.833
Ah?

48:01.083 --> 48:02.583
What's going on?

48:03.666 --> 48:05.290
Why the fighting?

48:05.458 --> 48:06.582
This asshole set my truck on fire.

48:06.750 --> 48:07.790
Is the gas Ok?

48:07.958 --> 48:08.749
You burn my truck?

48:08.916 --> 48:09.624
What's on your mind?

48:09.791 --> 48:10.457
You want blow me up?

48:10.625 --> 48:11.207
I got no money,

48:11.375 --> 48:12.375
if I did you'd have it.

48:12.541 --> 48:14.421
You got no money and you
burn my fucking truck!

48:16.833 --> 48:18.333
Get up!

48:20.559 --> 48:21.559
Stand up!

48:21.583 --> 48:22.040
Straight!

48:22.291 --> 48:23.291
Man.

48:23.375 --> 48:23.832
It's my fault.

48:24.000 --> 48:24.707
I'm sorry.

48:24.875 --> 48:25.374
I'm sorry!

48:25.666 --> 48:27.166
I apologize!

48:30.041 --> 48:31.541
Sorry's not good enough.

48:32.166 --> 48:33.666
I'm gonna remodel your car...

48:39.583 --> 48:40.583
Hey.

48:40.750 --> 48:42.874
Hey what?

48:43.041 --> 48:43.290
Hey, hey.

48:43.458 --> 48:44.958
Hey what?

48:48.541 --> 48:50.041
Brother.

48:50.851 --> 48:51.851
Let's see how far you can run!

48:51.875 --> 48:53.207
Bro, he fucking bites.

48:53.375 --> 48:54.375
Hurry up.

48:54.625 --> 48:55.915
What the..., you fucking idiot?

48:56.083 --> 48:57.583
You let him bite you?

48:57.666 --> 48:59.166
Go get him, that way!

49:00.166 --> 49:01.666
Get him!

49:02.458 --> 49:03.958
Take the bat.

49:06.809 --> 49:07.809
Don't run.

49:07.833 --> 49:09.353
I told you, you're not going anywhere.

49:34.833 --> 49:36.749
People are capable of doing anything.

49:36.916 --> 49:38.416
When they are in extreme danger,

49:38.916 --> 49:40.749
it's so called animal instinct.

51:53.208 --> 51:54.708
So where are we anyway?

51:56.833 --> 51:57.914
What happened to your face?

51:58.000 --> 51:59.082
Get out!

51:59.250 --> 52:00.750
Hey, hey that hurts!

52:00.934 --> 52:01.934
Get out!

52:01.958 --> 52:02.749
You're hurting me!

52:02.916 --> 52:04.156
My stuff is still in the car...

52:04.166 --> 52:05.666
Hey, what's the matter with you?

52:07.875 --> 52:09.415
Mister, please, I'm begging you...

52:09.583 --> 52:11.083
...don't leave me here.

52:11.166 --> 52:12.666
Go home!

52:12.750 --> 52:14.250
Look, I'll tell you the truth.

52:15.083 --> 52:16.624
I'm not from the dancing academy.

52:17.041 --> 52:18.541
My family is in Hebei.

52:18.916 --> 52:21.665
They sold me to a trafficker for 20,000,

52:21.833 --> 52:24.124
and then he married me to that asshole.

52:24.291 --> 52:26.040
You think I'd marry him?

52:26.208 --> 52:27.749
And he makes me work to pay him back.

52:28.041 --> 52:29.541
You go back right now.

52:29.642 --> 52:30.642
I'm not lying.

52:30.666 --> 52:32.166
Cross my heart and hope to die.

52:32.416 --> 52:33.916
Really!

52:34.000 --> 52:35.500
Go back.

52:57.541 --> 52:58.541
Get out!

52:58.916 --> 53:01.040
How do you expect me to go that far alone?

53:01.208 --> 53:03.082
- Please, just get out of there.
- Can't you rescue me?

53:03.250 --> 53:04.999
- Get out, then we'll talk.
- No!

53:06.208 --> 53:08.248
- Save me, please?
- We discuss it when you get out.

53:08.375 --> 53:09.936
Please, I can't go back that far alone.

53:26.934 --> 53:27.934
Open the door! Open the door!

53:27.958 --> 53:28.457
Open the door!

53:28.625 --> 53:30.125
Ahhh, just open it.

53:31.041 --> 53:32.541
Open it!

53:53.541 --> 53:55.041
Mister, look...

53:56.500 --> 53:58.000
I'll tell you the truth,

53:58.833 --> 54:01.207
I do okay here,

54:02.166 --> 54:03.374
There's no competition,

54:03.541 --> 54:05.041
the boss likes me...

54:05.541 --> 54:06.541
it's alright.

54:06.833 --> 54:08.040
Alright, I won't disturb you.

54:08.208 --> 54:09.708
I'm leaving now.

54:23.375 --> 54:24.875
Burglary...

54:25.125 --> 54:26.749
...for a large amount, 3-10 years.

54:28.208 --> 54:29.708
Battery...

54:30.083 --> 54:32.207
...if aggravate dis also 3-10 years...

54:32.375 --> 54:33.875
...plus punitive compensation.

54:34.309 --> 54:35.309
Bigamy...

54:35.333 --> 54:37.582
...bigamy is section 258... right,

54:38.000 --> 54:39.500
Two years in jail, minimum 2 years.

54:41.684 --> 54:42.684
I'm really a lawyer.

54:42.708 --> 54:46.582
Do you believe me?

54:48.767 --> 54:49.767
You don't believe me.

54:49.791 --> 54:51.291
You don't believe me at all!

54:59.142 --> 55:00.142
Let me ask you something.

55:00.166 --> 55:01.832
Did you smell gasoline?

55:03.517 --> 55:04.517
So you think...

55:04.541 --> 55:06.041
...I poured gasoline on him?

55:07.017 --> 55:08.017
No, no.

55:08.041 --> 55:08.749
I didn't think that, not that...

55:08.916 --> 55:09.582
You're lying!

55:09.750 --> 55:10.750
That's what you thought!

55:11.125 --> 55:12.125
Do you believe me?

55:12.208 --> 55:14.415
Yeah, I believe you.

55:14.666 --> 55:15.915
Don't say you believe me when you don't.

55:16.083 --> 55:17.290
- You have to believe me, really!
- I do,

55:17.458 --> 55:20.099
- I believe you deep down my heart.
- I really believe you, really.

55:31.625 --> 55:32.625
Help! Help! Help!

55:32.791 --> 55:33.791
Hey what are you doing?

55:33.875 --> 55:34.875
Are you nuts?

55:34.916 --> 55:35.499
Help!

55:35.666 --> 55:36.165
You fucking crazy?

55:36.333 --> 55:37.165
Help!

55:37.333 --> 55:38.454
What the heck you are doing?

55:38.541 --> 55:40.082
Help!

56:17.250 --> 56:18.530
Are you trying to kill yourself?

56:18.625 --> 56:19.749
Don't kill me, Mister!

56:19.916 --> 56:20.957
Are you trying to kill yourself?

56:21.125 --> 56:23.082
Don't kill me!

56:34.500 --> 56:36.874
Don't touch my money!

56:37.666 --> 56:39.166
You monster!

56:39.541 --> 56:40.707
Don't touch my money!

56:40.875 --> 56:42.375
You asshole! Don't touch my money!

56:42.666 --> 56:44.040
- Don't move, listen!
- Don't touch my money!

56:44.208 --> 56:45.708
Listen to me!

56:54.250 --> 56:55.750
This is my bank card,

56:55.916 --> 56:57.416
take it.

56:57.666 --> 56:59.166
There's 200,000 in the account,

57:00.166 --> 57:01.666
the password is the account number.

57:02.666 --> 57:04.166
I don't want it.

57:04.666 --> 57:06.166
You can have it all.

57:06.625 --> 57:08.125
Do you understand?

57:08.541 --> 57:09.541
You can have all of it.

57:09.708 --> 57:10.708
I don't want anything.

57:11.083 --> 57:12.583
If you want the car you can take it.

57:12.666 --> 57:13.666
I don't want anything!

57:13.875 --> 57:15.375
Go!

57:15.642 --> 57:16.642
Just Go!

57:16.666 --> 57:18.166
Just leave me alone, Ok?

57:18.208 --> 57:19.708
Just leave me alone!

58:26.000 --> 58:27.707
My career comes to the end.

58:28.375 --> 58:30.290
So is my life.

58:30.625 --> 58:32.457
Hey, Mister. Don't be like that...

58:32.625 --> 58:34.125
All the media were gonna be there...

58:35.375 --> 58:37.665
And I was gonna make the headline news...

58:39.833 --> 58:41.333
Now...

58:43.916 --> 58:45.749
Ha, I guess I'll make headlines anyway.

58:47.833 --> 58:49.333
What's so great about being famous?

58:50.916 --> 58:52.316
If you weren't so worried about it,

58:52.375 --> 58:53.540
...you wouldn't be afraid right now.

58:53.708 --> 58:54.749
You have 200,000.

58:54.916 --> 58:55.665
Two hundred thousand?

58:55.833 --> 58:57.333
Doesn't do me anything.

58:58.000 --> 59:00.040
In two years I've only saved 20,000.

59:01.291 --> 59:02.415
And I know just what I'm going to do.

59:02.666 --> 59:04.874
There's a little place
in Jiuquan called Anxi.

59:06.583 --> 59:08.790
Nobody knows me there.

59:10.208 --> 59:11.915
I'm going to rent a place in town,

59:12.083 --> 59:13.083
install some mirrors...

59:13.291 --> 59:15.040
...and maybe start a dancing
school or something.

59:15.208 --> 59:16.915
Didn't you say you were from Hebei?

59:25.125 --> 59:26.625
Listen...

59:26.833 --> 59:28.082
In this industry...

59:28.250 --> 59:29.499
...if the first thing out
of a girl's mouth is,

59:29.666 --> 59:31.166
"I'll tell you the truth,"

59:31.916 --> 59:33.915
then the rest isn't the truth.

59:36.375 --> 59:38.374
Just like my industry...

59:39.250 --> 59:41.290
You know what, Pan Xiao,
you know what I think?

59:41.458 --> 59:42.332
You could open a boutique store.

59:42.500 --> 59:44.249
- Hire some people, rent a place...
- Go, just go!

59:44.416 --> 59:45.457
Or drive a taxi?

59:45.625 --> 59:46.290
You could buy a car...

59:46.458 --> 59:46.957
Oh good god,

59:47.125 --> 59:48.207
- Pan Xiao.
- Just go!

59:48.375 --> 59:50.495
- I told you is true.
- I need some time to think, Ok?

01:00:14.166 --> 01:00:15.666
Hey, you're not dead!

01:00:18.833 --> 01:00:20.457
You're not dead!

01:00:23.166 --> 01:00:24.832
How could you...?

01:00:29.208 --> 01:00:30.708
Ha! That's fantastic!

01:00:32.333 --> 01:00:33.833
He's not dead,

01:00:34.208 --> 01:00:36.040
...and if he's not dead I'm fine!

01:00:37.041 --> 01:00:39.624
Hey buddy, you scared the crap out of me!

01:00:39.791 --> 01:00:40.915
I mean, oh my god, you...

01:00:41.083 --> 01:00:43.665
This whole thing is just a bad joke...

01:00:57.708 --> 01:00:59.582
I'm not dead, what about you?

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:09.500
This guy...

01:01:09.833 --> 01:01:11.333
So where is he?

01:01:15.541 --> 01:01:17.041
One hundred.

01:01:26.916 --> 01:01:28.416
He got in a fight here...

01:01:28.666 --> 01:01:30.707
...and then took our girl away.

01:01:31.208 --> 01:01:33.249
We're looking for him right now.

01:01:35.375 --> 01:01:36.875
Then did you see...

01:01:37.500 --> 01:01:39.000
...if he had a falcon with him?

01:01:47.666 --> 01:01:49.166
How would I know?

01:01:54.375 --> 01:01:55.875
Wait a minute.

01:01:57.500 --> 01:01:59.790
I'll need another 50...

01:02:00.750 --> 01:02:02.290
...if you want me to keep this secret.

01:02:10.208 --> 01:02:11.874
You're a falcon dealer?

01:02:26.166 --> 01:02:27.666
You're smart.

01:03:16.250 --> 01:03:18.040
Hey, there's one more favor I need.

01:03:23.208 --> 01:03:24.708
Open the back seat...

01:03:29.791 --> 01:03:31.291
...and pull on the rope.

01:03:40.708 --> 01:03:42.374
There's something in there I need.

01:03:54.333 --> 01:03:55.874
Good, fantastic.

01:03:57.250 --> 01:03:58.750
The falcon's Ok, anyway.

01:04:00.708 --> 01:04:01.708
Alright,

01:04:02.083 --> 01:04:03.583
then you...

01:04:04.708 --> 01:04:06.957
...you have your stuff...

01:04:07.375 --> 01:04:08.875
...and...

01:04:09.750 --> 01:04:10.874
...and you have your car...

01:04:11.041 --> 01:04:12.541
...park right here...

01:04:13.625 --> 01:04:15.125
I gotta go,

01:04:15.833 --> 01:04:17.333
take care.

01:04:23.041 --> 01:04:24.082
Mr. Pan.

01:04:24.416 --> 01:04:25.665
Don't be such a rush.

01:04:25.833 --> 01:04:27.707
We still have some things to talk about.

01:04:32.541 --> 01:04:34.041
Let me ask you something.

01:04:34.625 --> 01:04:36.125
If a man

01:04:36.791 --> 01:04:38.291
had his car broken,

01:04:39.416 --> 01:04:41.999
and he waits by the road for help,

01:04:43.583 --> 01:04:45.083
has that man done something wrong?

01:04:45.625 --> 01:04:47.125
No, nothing.

01:04:49.958 --> 01:04:51.458
Nothing?

01:04:53.750 --> 01:04:56.124
Then why did you run into him?

01:04:56.666 --> 01:04:58.166
His leg was broken,

01:04:59.416 --> 01:05:00.916
blood flowed...

01:05:04.875 --> 01:05:05.875
Ay.

01:05:06.208 --> 01:05:07.708
Why did you do that?

01:05:08.083 --> 01:05:10.582
I didn't do it on purpose.

01:05:11.958 --> 01:05:13.458
He didn't do it on purpose.

01:05:19.958 --> 01:05:21.458
And when you hit him,

01:05:22.541 --> 01:05:24.061
why didn't you take him to a hospital?

01:05:26.416 --> 01:05:27.416
I thought...

01:05:27.500 --> 01:05:29.000
...I thought you were dead.

01:05:31.166 --> 01:05:32.666
Is that man dead?

01:05:33.125 --> 01:05:34.625
No?

01:05:35.666 --> 01:05:39.332
Why did you pour gasoline on that man?

01:05:48.916 --> 01:05:50.624
You're a very bad man.

01:05:52.708 --> 01:05:55.749
Do you realize that what
you've done is serious?

01:05:55.916 --> 01:05:58.582
Do you realize how it impacts society?

01:06:07.791 --> 01:06:09.291
OK.

01:06:09.916 --> 01:06:11.540
Get the tube from the car.

01:06:17.500 --> 01:06:19.000
Go!

01:06:25.458 --> 01:06:26.958
Now suck the gas out.

01:06:29.041 --> 01:06:30.541
Why?

01:06:53.833 --> 01:06:55.333
Pour it out.

01:07:06.666 --> 01:07:08.166
Pour it on your head.

01:07:20.750 --> 01:07:22.749
Good, good, good.

01:07:23.708 --> 01:07:25.208
Put it down.

01:07:31.750 --> 01:07:33.250
Get away from the car...

01:07:46.958 --> 01:07:48.540
You're terrified, don't you?

01:07:49.458 --> 01:07:50.458
How is it?

01:07:50.583 --> 01:07:52.707
The smell isn't so good, is it?

01:07:55.375 --> 01:07:56.875
No, it's not.

01:07:57.291 --> 01:07:58.791
Not good,

01:07:59.333 --> 01:08:00.833
no good to smell.

01:08:03.125 --> 01:08:04.625
I've got gas on me,

01:08:07.708 --> 01:08:09.208
and my leg is hurt.

01:08:12.958 --> 01:08:14.238
We're even, alright? We're even.

01:08:14.250 --> 01:08:15.957
You're all fucked up now.

01:08:19.666 --> 01:08:20.666
Hey,

01:08:20.957 --> 01:08:22.457
we should get you to a hospital,

01:08:23.041 --> 01:08:24.915
your leg doesn't look good...

01:08:25.082 --> 01:08:26.582
before it's too late.

01:08:27.375 --> 01:08:29.249
Oh, so you love him?

01:08:31.207 --> 01:08:32.207
Okay,

01:08:32.416 --> 01:08:34.124
you wanna go with him?

01:08:44.457 --> 01:08:45.457
Hey, slut,

01:08:45.707 --> 01:08:48.124
feel his pocket, see if he
has a lighter in there.

01:09:00.041 --> 01:09:01.041
Mr. Pan?

01:09:01.541 --> 01:09:03.999
It isn't a clue,

01:09:04.166 --> 01:09:05.832
it's proof, right?

01:09:06.041 --> 01:09:07.041
Come on,

01:09:07.166 --> 01:09:08.666
light his hair!

01:09:10.207 --> 01:09:11.707
Light it.

01:09:15.332 --> 01:09:17.082
You don't want him to die?

01:09:18.625 --> 01:09:20.499
What about you? Do you wanna die?

01:09:26.166 --> 01:09:27.666
Light it!

01:09:34.375 --> 01:09:35.875
One...

01:09:41.500 --> 01:09:43.000
Two...

01:09:59.291 --> 01:10:00.791
Hey, there's that fucker.

01:10:16.625 --> 01:10:17.625
Help!

01:10:17.708 --> 01:10:19.208
Run!

01:11:12.958 --> 01:11:14.678
Do you know a village called ErDao Liangzi?

01:13:39.541 --> 01:13:41.041
This won't work,

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:46.500
I told you.

01:13:46.750 --> 01:13:48.250
He's got a gun.

01:13:50.916 --> 01:13:52.416
Yeah?

01:13:52.583 --> 01:13:54.083
I've got a truck,

01:13:54.208 --> 01:13:55.708
I'm gonna hit the bastard.

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:00.500
Hey, calm down!

01:14:01.208 --> 01:14:02.708
We should get outta here

01:14:03.250 --> 01:14:04.750
and call the cops.

01:14:07.083 --> 01:14:08.790
We should call the cops.

01:14:09.559 --> 01:14:10.559
Man, you don't know,

01:14:10.583 --> 01:14:12.083
I'm a lawyer...

01:14:13.166 --> 01:14:14.666
So what?

01:14:15.375 --> 01:14:16.875
You caused all this!

01:14:17.333 --> 01:14:18.833
You brought him out!

01:14:19.166 --> 01:14:20.666
My brother's dead because of you.

01:14:21.625 --> 01:14:23.125
Fuck off!

01:14:49.500 --> 01:14:51.000
Suddenly I realized that...

01:14:51.666 --> 01:14:53.166
...now...

01:14:53.208 --> 01:14:55.249
...I was that monkey.

01:14:56.041 --> 01:14:59.249
I was placed at the dog-eat-dog world,

01:15:01.875 --> 01:15:03.415
and you know what's more pathetic?

01:15:04.416 --> 01:15:07.915
Nobody's under the tree looking out for me.

01:16:05.208 --> 01:16:06.874
Oh, I forgot about you are vegetarian.

01:16:08.625 --> 01:16:10.125
What do you want for me?

01:16:12.791 --> 01:16:14.291
Friends,

01:16:14.375 --> 01:16:15.957
should help each other.

01:16:20.375 --> 01:16:21.375
We...

01:16:21.791 --> 01:16:23.291
...are not friends.

01:16:24.583 --> 01:16:26.083
We are different!

01:16:27.750 --> 01:16:29.457
You don't know yourself.

01:16:29.625 --> 01:16:30.790
You write your own damn book,

01:16:30.958 --> 01:16:32.118
I smuggle my own damn falcon,

01:16:32.166 --> 01:16:33.832
we had the same goal.

01:16:34.666 --> 01:16:36.166
I believe,

01:16:36.958 --> 01:16:38.458
we...

01:16:40.083 --> 01:16:41.624
...are still different.

01:16:49.333 --> 01:16:50.833
Take it.

01:16:54.458 --> 01:16:55.958
You could call the police.

01:17:16.333 --> 01:17:17.333
So,

01:17:17.708 --> 01:17:19.468
I could help you to find
something you want,

01:17:21.041 --> 01:17:22.541
you take me our here.

01:17:49.059 --> 01:17:50.059
Mister...

01:17:50.083 --> 01:17:50.790
Don't do this to me!

01:17:50.958 --> 01:17:52.458
I can't drive!

01:18:08.666 --> 01:18:10.915
What the hell's wrong with you?

01:18:11.083 --> 01:18:12.207
I was not meant to do it.

01:18:12.375 --> 01:18:13.875
Are you trying to kill me?

01:18:23.166 --> 01:18:24.207
Yeah, you're tough...

01:18:24.375 --> 01:18:25.875
...kidnapping my woman??

01:18:30.041 --> 01:18:31.541
Who the hell are you?

01:18:33.333 --> 01:18:34.833
Where's the guy in the suit?

01:18:43.750 --> 01:18:45.749
Who are you?

01:18:49.041 --> 01:18:51.832
How many idiots am I gonna meet today?

01:18:54.166 --> 01:18:55.666
Come here!

01:19:01.416 --> 01:19:02.916
Leave me alone.

01:19:07.541 --> 01:19:09.707
What are you doing?

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:15.290
Nice knife.

01:19:15.708 --> 01:19:17.208
Come on, stab me.

01:19:18.541 --> 01:19:20.041
What's this?

01:19:20.500 --> 01:19:22.000
Oh, it's a gun.

01:19:24.291 --> 01:19:26.207
You're hardcore.

01:19:26.375 --> 01:19:27.999
Is that a hammer?

01:19:28.250 --> 01:19:30.332
Come here and smash my head in,

01:19:30.500 --> 01:19:31.124
do it!

01:19:31.291 --> 01:19:32.791
Come here!

01:19:43.083 --> 01:19:44.583
You really are a fucking idiot!

01:19:58.791 --> 01:20:01.874
You almost got me killed!

01:20:03.750 --> 01:20:05.250
Get up!

01:20:06.666 --> 01:20:08.874
You're playing around with guns huh?

01:20:40.916 --> 01:20:42.540
Where were you going?

01:21:09.375 --> 01:21:10.875
My hands hurt.

01:21:13.375 --> 01:21:15.207
Take off my ropes, Ok?

01:22:46.791 --> 01:22:48.291
My falcon?

01:22:51.041 --> 01:22:59.041
Where's my falcon?

01:23:10.250 --> 01:23:11.750
His dad took it.

01:23:12.125 --> 01:23:13.625
You know him.

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:02.500
Get in.

01:25:05.083 --> 01:25:06.583
Don't.

01:25:08.041 --> 01:25:09.665
She's a girl.

01:25:09.833 --> 01:25:11.333
Just let her go.

01:25:16.416 --> 01:25:20.790
Friend do this thing for me, Ok?

01:25:35.250 --> 01:25:36.750
Hello? 110?

01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:38.332
I saw a hit and run...

01:25:38.500 --> 01:25:40.707
...on Yanbai Road, a red car.

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:42.500
Come as fast as you can.

01:25:47.333 --> 01:25:49.290
You! Why did you do that?

01:25:50.125 --> 01:25:51.625
Friends...

01:25:52.250 --> 01:25:54.082
...are gonna help their friends.

01:26:57.666 --> 01:26:59.166
I'll give you this,

01:27:00.458 --> 01:27:01.958
just don't kill him!

01:27:45.375 --> 01:27:46.665
Don't take her money...

01:27:46.833 --> 01:27:48.333
...you don't deserve it.

01:27:48.833 --> 01:27:52.582
Give it back.

01:30:26.583 --> 01:30:28.415
You poisoned by carbon monoxide.

01:30:28.625 --> 01:30:30.249
Water will make you die faster.

01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:34.500
What's this about?

01:30:45.791 --> 01:30:48.624
He took the girl.

01:30:48.791 --> 01:30:50.749
He's gonna kill her.

01:30:50.916 --> 01:30:52.416
The falcon dealer.

01:30:52.916 --> 01:30:56.207
I don't think he's going to let her go.

01:30:56.666 --> 01:30:58.166
You think?

01:30:58.333 --> 01:30:59.665
That's not enough, is it?

01:30:59.833 --> 01:31:02.540
The law demands evidence.
Do you have evidence?

01:31:05.541 --> 01:31:07.041
Do you?

01:31:08.166 --> 01:31:09.666
You don't?

01:31:11.833 --> 01:31:13.333
Well, I do.

01:31:15.791 --> 01:31:17.332
I've got the suspect.

01:31:18.083 --> 01:31:21.290
It's on maker 320 send a car.

01:31:36.375 --> 01:31:37.875
No, wrong way!

01:31:38.291 --> 01:31:39.791
U-turn.

01:31:40.208 --> 01:31:41.708
Erdao Liangzi!

01:31:42.041 --> 01:31:43.374
You have to get to Erdao Liangzi!

01:31:43.541 --> 01:31:44.582
Or she'll die!

01:31:44.833 --> 01:31:46.082
You've been poisoned.

01:31:46.333 --> 01:31:47.415
Save your thoughts.

01:31:47.583 --> 01:31:48.457
Ignore the voices in your head.

01:31:48.625 --> 01:31:50.125
Get some rest.

01:31:58.666 --> 01:32:00.166
I'm sorry, sir!

01:32:28.750 --> 01:32:30.250
Wake up,

01:32:30.500 --> 01:32:32.000
wake the hell up!

01:32:36.184 --> 01:32:37.184
Hello? Police.

01:32:37.208 --> 01:32:38.708
Hello, I gotta report to you,

01:32:38.875 --> 01:32:40.375
Erdao Liangzi!

01:32:40.458 --> 01:32:42.290
There's been a kidnapping, possible murder,

01:32:42.458 --> 01:32:43.698
and poaching of protected birds.

01:32:43.708 --> 01:32:44.207
Ah?

01:32:44.375 --> 01:32:45.875
Ahya! God, he's a murderer!

01:35:02.583 --> 01:35:04.165
Hey, know anybody who buys falcons?

01:35:41.125 --> 01:35:43.582
Anyone?

01:36:59.125 --> 01:37:00.415
Just like I told you,

01:37:00.583 --> 01:37:02.083
the goods are here.

01:37:06.250 --> 01:37:07.582
When did you go from being a falcon...

01:37:07.750 --> 01:37:09.250
...poacher to a hitman?

01:37:10.083 --> 01:37:12.540
- Does that scare you?
- Me, afraid...

01:37:13.583 --> 01:37:15.957
My entire life, I go
abroad every other week.

01:37:16.125 --> 01:37:16.957
I had a deal in tens of millions.

01:37:17.125 --> 01:37:19.249
But I don't kill people.

01:37:21.708 --> 01:37:23.208
Here's the money.

01:37:24.708 --> 01:37:27.124
You get it after you clean up down there.

01:37:28.750 --> 01:37:30.250
Drag it out.

01:37:34.125 --> 01:37:35.249
What are you doing?

01:37:35.416 --> 01:37:36.207
What do you think?

01:37:36.375 --> 01:37:37.875
Well, what can I say?

01:37:38.666 --> 01:37:40.499
You can't keep doing this.

01:37:40.666 --> 01:37:41.987
Do you think you are eating buns?

01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:43.500
One after the other one?

01:37:44.083 --> 01:37:46.207
You should stop doing it.

01:37:46.375 --> 01:37:47.040
Did you hear me?

01:37:47.208 --> 01:37:47.707
Do it!

01:37:47.875 --> 01:37:49.040
Hey, you...

01:37:49.208 --> 01:37:50.208
Fine fine fine.

01:37:50.375 --> 01:37:51.165
If you don't want to listen to me,

01:37:51.333 --> 01:37:52.415
then do whatever you want.

01:37:52.583 --> 01:37:53.415
I say I'm abroad now.

01:37:53.583 --> 01:37:54.790
I didn't hear or see anything.

01:37:54.958 --> 01:37:56.458
I don't know anything about it.

01:38:03.458 --> 01:38:04.958
What plans?

01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:07.500
What? I'm in China.

01:38:07.625 --> 01:38:09.290
My wife wanted me to get her something.

01:38:09.458 --> 01:38:10.958
Wait a bit longer.

01:38:21.750 --> 01:38:22.750
Micheal, call the police.

01:38:22.916 --> 01:38:23.707
Where are you?

01:38:23.875 --> 01:38:25.749
There are 800 people waiting for you!

01:38:25.916 --> 01:38:26.499
Erdao Liangzi!

01:38:26.666 --> 01:38:27.082
Call the cops! Call the cops!

01:38:27.250 --> 01:38:27.915
Erdao Liangzi!

01:38:28.083 --> 01:38:28.707
Hurry up, call the cops!

01:38:28.875 --> 01:38:29.665
What police?

01:38:29.833 --> 01:38:31.124
Hurry it up!

01:38:31.291 --> 01:38:32.457
Call the police!

01:38:32.625 --> 01:38:33.915
- You think you made a fool of me?
- I know.

01:38:34.083 --> 01:38:35.874
- This is you, your career! Are you aware of that?
- God dammit, I know!

01:38:36.041 --> 01:38:38.249
- Keep the whole page on paper for me!
- Fuck, I know.

01:38:46.958 --> 01:38:48.458
Hello?

01:38:51.250 --> 01:38:53.665
Say something! Hello?

01:38:59.250 --> 01:39:01.040
Can you hear me?

01:39:04.208 --> 01:39:06.665
- Mr. Pan.
- Hello? Keep going.

01:39:06.833 --> 01:39:08.333
Everyone is here, the media,

01:39:08.416 --> 01:39:08.999
leaders all waiting for you.

01:39:09.267 --> 01:39:10.267
Then just wait.

01:39:10.291 --> 01:39:11.791
What about the under table money?

01:39:12.916 --> 01:39:14.499
Don't hand out a cent if I don't show.

01:39:14.666 --> 01:39:15.790
- Do you hear it?
- Ok.

01:39:15.958 --> 01:39:16.999
You tell me.

01:39:17.166 --> 01:39:18.666
- Are you done?
- No.

01:39:18.916 --> 01:39:20.040
I've got a big case to handle here.

01:39:20.250 --> 01:39:21.750
Bye.

01:39:23.166 --> 01:39:25.165
You dig everyone out!

01:39:27.208 --> 01:39:28.708
Who the hell are you?

01:39:30.416 --> 01:39:31.665
You could never die huh.

01:39:31.833 --> 01:39:33.333
Shut up, listen to me.

01:39:33.583 --> 01:39:35.083
Think about why I released you.

01:39:35.208 --> 01:39:36.874
I was trying to give you a second chance!

01:39:37.208 --> 01:39:38.957
Your sentence just got a lot harsher!

01:39:40.083 --> 01:39:41.563
But what you did is kill more people.

01:39:41.583 --> 01:39:43.083
Your sentence just got a harsher!

01:39:43.166 --> 01:39:44.666
You stand still.

01:39:45.583 --> 01:39:47.083
What are you doing?

01:39:55.666 --> 01:39:57.332
Bullshit. There's no cops.

01:39:59.541 --> 01:40:01.290
Just you?

01:40:01.458 --> 01:40:02.958
And you want to stop me?

01:40:03.916 --> 01:40:06.124
You must think I'm an idiot...

01:40:06.916 --> 01:40:08.416
..."divide and conquer".

01:40:10.791 --> 01:40:12.707
I think you forgot something.

01:40:17.041 --> 01:40:18.749
You are really an idiot!

01:40:19.916 --> 01:40:21.249
Let me tell you some truth,

01:40:21.416 --> 01:40:22.916
cops are gonna be here in minute.

01:40:23.500 --> 01:40:25.000
Get in his truck,

01:40:25.583 --> 01:40:27.249
and push redial on his satellite phone.

01:40:28.125 --> 01:40:29.625
See if they're coming or not.

01:40:35.333 --> 01:40:36.833
He called the cops!

01:40:38.250 --> 01:40:39.250
Don't move!

01:40:39.333 --> 01:40:40.999
No wonder you're so late.

01:40:41.166 --> 01:40:42.666
You backstabber!

01:40:43.375 --> 01:40:45.749
You are a idiot!

01:41:15.416 --> 01:41:16.916
I'll fucking kill you!

01:41:17.125 --> 01:41:17.749
Wait.

01:41:17.916 --> 01:41:18.540
What?

01:41:18.833 --> 01:41:20.333
I need the proof!

01:41:26.750 --> 01:41:28.250
Run.

01:41:30.458 --> 01:41:31.958
I'm fine.

01:41:36.666 --> 01:41:38.166
Run.

01:41:45.791 --> 01:41:47.291
Split, run!

01:42:08.375 --> 01:42:09.875
Get up! Come on!

01:42:11.166 --> 01:42:13.082
Get up!

01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:04.500
What's this?

01:43:04.708 --> 01:43:06.208
You're a bloody wreck.

01:43:08.833 --> 01:43:11.040
Go. There's a first-aid kit in the truck.

01:43:19.458 --> 01:43:20.958
Have a cigarette!

01:43:22.017 --> 01:43:23.017
Smoke!

01:43:23.041 --> 01:43:24.541
It won't kill you!

01:43:27.541 --> 01:43:29.207
Don't throw lighters around anymore, Ok?

01:43:29.375 --> 01:43:30.124
Tell you what,

01:43:30.291 --> 01:43:31.791
this time I'll let you...

01:44:31.166 --> 01:44:32.666
let her go.

01:44:50.416 --> 01:44:51.916
Hurry up, get out of here!

01:44:53.833 --> 01:44:55.333
You go first.

01:44:56.291 --> 01:44:57.791
Just go!

01:44:58.791 --> 01:45:00.665
Go! Get up.

01:45:03.208 --> 01:45:04.708
Get the fuck up!

01:45:06.416 --> 01:45:07.916
I can't run anymore.

01:45:09.291 --> 01:45:10.791
You should run.

01:45:11.125 --> 01:45:13.124
Tell the world what was going on here.

01:45:15.291 --> 01:45:16.791
Get the fuck out!

01:45:38.708 --> 01:45:40.208
Why?

01:45:41.375 --> 01:45:43.082
You are alive,

01:45:43.875 --> 01:45:45.415
why you came back?

01:45:47.208 --> 01:45:49.499
You think you could save her by yourself?

01:45:56.583 --> 01:45:58.540
You'll never understand.

01:46:00.125 --> 01:46:01.874
We have nothing in common.

01:46:03.083 --> 01:46:04.583
You are an animal.

01:46:09.416 --> 01:46:10.916
Sure.

01:46:12.458 --> 01:46:13.958
You are vegetarian.

01:46:15.333 --> 01:46:16.957
I am carnivore.

01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:25.624
You should watch her die first.

01:46:43.583 --> 01:46:45.207
How could I not recall anything?

01:46:45.375 --> 01:46:47.540
What's the teacher's name?

01:46:48.458 --> 01:46:50.665
Let's call him "Teacher monkey".

01:46:51.833 --> 01:46:53.665
I still want to tell him,

01:46:54.416 --> 01:46:55.916
that I was absolutely right.

01:46:56.666 --> 01:46:59.082
The biggest difference
between a man and an animal,

01:46:59.833 --> 01:47:02.415
is we learned how to use fire.

01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:10.374
Tomorrow I could make the headline.

01:49:17.333 --> 01:49:18.915
I was looking at that bird.

01:49:19.416 --> 01:49:21.124
Why does it fly that high,

01:49:21.625 --> 01:49:22.707
risking its life for...

01:49:23.083 --> 01:49:24.583
...a mouthful of food?

01:49:25.166 --> 01:49:26.874
I'm like that bird.

01:49:27.916 --> 01:49:29.457
Those years in no-man's land...

01:49:30.208 --> 01:49:31.708
...were wasted ones.

01:49:33.125 --> 01:49:34.749
Nobody treats me like...

01:49:34.958 --> 01:49:36.832
...I'm a human being, not even myself.

01:49:37.708 --> 01:49:39.208
That truck driver who saved me,

01:49:39.375 --> 01:49:40.375
looked at me on the way,

01:49:40.875 --> 01:49:42.375
starring,

01:49:42.708 --> 01:49:44.208
said nothing at all.

01:49:45.083 --> 01:49:46.083
I was then thinking,

01:49:46.583 --> 01:49:48.624
I'm gonna do something and
make people be proud.

01:49:55.375 --> 01:49:56.375
It's all over.

01:49:56.750 --> 01:49:57.750
So, in the future,

01:49:58.125 --> 01:49:59.625
are you leaving again?

01:50:00.125 --> 01:50:01.625
No,

01:50:03.291 --> 01:50:04.791
I'm tired.

01:50:05.375 --> 01:50:06.457
I just want to stay here.

01:50:06.666 --> 01:50:07.374
To find,

01:50:07.541 --> 01:50:09.041
find a real job here.

01:50:10.625 --> 01:50:12.125
I've been gone for so long...

01:50:12.416 --> 01:50:13.957
I don't even have any friends left.

01:50:19.083 --> 01:50:21.290
- Hello, Mrs. Xing.
- Hello, class.

01:50:22.434 --> 01:50:23.434
I need to start class.

01:50:23.458 --> 01:50:24.958
You wait here, Ok?

01:50:25.083 --> 01:50:26.415
Get your clothes off,

01:50:26.583 --> 01:50:28.083
get ready.

01:50:28.666 --> 01:50:31.499
- What's wrong with Shi Hanyu?
- She's sick today.

01:50:31.666 --> 01:50:33.166
Take it easy, take it easy.

01:50:33.517 --> 01:50:34.517
Don't shout! Don't shout!

01:50:34.541 --> 01:50:34.957
Come on everybody.

01:50:35.166 --> 01:50:35.957
Come on now, 2nd formation.

01:50:36.125 --> 01:50:36.832
Let's get started,

01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:37.624
alright?

01:50:37.791 --> 01:50:38.874
Everybody hold hands,

01:50:39.125 --> 01:50:40.125
back up a step.

01:50:40.166 --> 01:50:42.082
Is everyone's arm straight? Yes?

01:50:42.333 --> 01:50:44.415
- Good. Come down.
- Yes.

01:50:44.583 --> 01:50:46.083
Turn right.

01:50:46.642 --> 01:50:47.642
Good.

01:50:47.666 --> 01:50:49.665
First hand position, get ready.

01:50:49.833 --> 01:50:51.540
Get set.

01:50:51.708 --> 01:50:52.915
Inhale! Exhale!

01:50:53.083 --> 01:50:54.624
Stretch! Stretch! Stretch!

01:50:54.791 --> 01:50:55.540
Right!

01:50:55.708 --> 01:50:57.208
Breath.

01:50:57.833 --> 01:50:59.333
Keep it up! You two.

01:50:59.541 --> 01:51:00.541
Good.

01:51:00.625 --> 01:51:04.374
Two two three four,

01:51:04.541 --> 01:51:08.040
five six seven eight.

01:51:08.208 --> 01:51:09.208
Mind to breath.

01:51:09.500 --> 01:51:11.000
Right!

01:51:11.625 --> 01:51:12.790
Open!

01:51:12.958 --> 01:51:13.958
Right!

01:51:14.250 --> 01:51:14.915
Hold your breath.

01:51:15.083 --> 01:51:16.083
Put it down.

01:51:16.559 --> 01:51:17.559
Come here, Maomao.

01:51:17.583 --> 01:51:19.083
Show it to everyone.

01:51:19.250 --> 01:51:20.750
Pay attention everyone!

01:51:20.875 --> 01:51:22.375
Don't forget what we just learned!

01:51:29.291 --> 01:51:30.791
Knees straight!

01:51:31.041 --> 01:51:32.541
Fantastic!

01:51:33.041 --> 01:51:35.499
Li Yuxin!

01:51:36.416 --> 01:51:37.957
You studied dance after that, right?

01:51:40.333 --> 01:51:42.082
Professional dance?

01:51:54.208 --> 01:51:55.208
No problem.

01:51:55.333 --> 01:51:55.874
Come on.

01:51:56.125 --> 01:51:58.457
Bring those mats over here for me.

01:52:02.375 --> 01:52:03.875
What are you two doing?

01:52:04.333 --> 01:52:05.833
Have you stretched your back?

01:52:07.958 --> 01:52:09.707
Don't just stand there, get moving!

01:52:09.875 --> 01:52:11.375
Put them on the floor.

01:52:12.750 --> 01:52:14.790
You'll be my assistant from now on.

01:52:16.375 --> 01:52:17.875
Try to keep up, okay?

01:52:19.059 --> 01:52:20.059
Children!

01:52:20.083 --> 01:52:22.165
This is Mrs. Li, our new teacher.

01:52:22.333 --> 01:52:23.915
Everyone say hello to Mrs. Li.

01:52:24.083 --> 01:52:27.582
Hello! Mrs. Li.

01:52:27.791 --> 01:52:29.291
Well, don't just stand there talking!

01:52:29.458 --> 01:52:30.499
Give me splits!

01:52:30.958 --> 01:52:32.458
Splits!

01:52:33.583 --> 01:52:35.083
You too.
