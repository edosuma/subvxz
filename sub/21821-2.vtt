WEBVTT

00:28.960 --> 00:31.040
Ah, your play's got a mention
in the paper.

00:31.120 --> 00:34.800
There's a photo of you as well.
And some protestors outside the theater.

00:34.880 --> 00:36.040
It's not a review, is it?

00:36.120 --> 00:40.080
It says "Stereotypical offensive
caricatures predominate

00:40.160 --> 00:41.960
in this cack-handed, abysmal travesty.

00:42.040 --> 00:45.720
One has to try very hard indeed to recall
a worse play on the London stage."

00:45.800 --> 00:49.960
Actually, Ed, please don't continue.
I don't think my guts could confront it.

00:50.040 --> 00:51.680
I've had much worse reviews than this.

00:51.760 --> 00:55.080
At least you're through the opening night.
Oh, they can be nerve-racking.

00:55.160 --> 00:56.360
I once tried to kill myself

00:56.440 --> 00:59.320
before the opening
of a very poor production of  Coriolanus.

00:59.400 --> 01:02.960
Took a massive cocktail of painkillers,
but the adrenaline just neutralized them.

01:03.040 --> 01:05.920
If you had killed yourself,
your career would be radically different.

01:06.000 --> 01:07.760
-How so?
-Well, you wouldn't receive

01:07.840 --> 01:10.200
your royalty checks on those
old dramas they play on ITV3!

01:10.280 --> 01:11.920
Ah, yeah.

01:12.000 --> 01:13.160
And you'd be dead!

01:14.200 --> 01:16.680
I gotta get off.
I'm rehearsing a new play.

01:17.160 --> 01:19.560
One job not enough for you, eh?
Good luck.

01:20.040 --> 01:22.160
-Quick cooking tip for you, Ed.
-Hm-hmm?

01:22.240 --> 01:26.040
When following a recipe, always
put twice the ingredients specified.

01:26.120 --> 01:28.040
If it says two carrots, put in four.

01:28.120 --> 01:29.920
One onion, put in two.

01:30.000 --> 01:32.720
Half a pound of mushrooms,
put in the full pound.

01:33.440 --> 01:35.440
Wouldn't you then
just get a very big meal?

01:47.040 --> 01:48.000
[Toast] Sorry I'm late.

01:48.080 --> 01:50.080
Having a shit-bag of a day.

01:50.160 --> 01:52.040
-Ray!
-[dramatic music]

01:52.120 --> 01:53.560
Oh, you're joking!

01:54.080 --> 01:55.840
Ray Purchase!

01:55.920 --> 01:58.920
Well, well, well!

01:59.000 --> 02:00.520
Look who it is!

02:00.600 --> 02:04.920
Steven "Hide Your Missus
'Cause I'll Fuck Anything" Toast!

02:05.000 --> 02:06.240
Get over it, Purchase.

02:06.320 --> 02:10.639
You two should leave any conflict
outside the door!

02:12.000 --> 02:13.520
Now join the circle.

02:14.320 --> 02:16.920
Let's begin by telling each other
who we are,

02:17.000 --> 02:18.880
the name of our character,

02:18.960 --> 02:20.760
and something interesting about us.

02:20.840 --> 02:22.160
Kika.

02:22.240 --> 02:25.160
My name is Kika Bright.
I'll be playing the part of Stella.

02:25.240 --> 02:29.800
And last year I performed Shakespeare
in Central Park with Scarlett Johansson!

02:31.080 --> 02:33.160
Very, very... swish!

02:33.240 --> 02:34.680
-[laughs]
-Ray.

02:34.760 --> 02:39.480
My name is Ray Purchase and I will be
playing the part of the magistrate.

02:39.560 --> 02:41.240
Something interesting about you?

02:41.320 --> 02:42.320
[stifles laugh]

02:43.000 --> 02:45.480
Well, Toast regularly fucks my wife!

02:45.560 --> 02:46.600
Oh, God!

02:46.680 --> 02:49.040
Can we not mention that again?

02:50.360 --> 02:54.320
Anyway, I'm Acker Herron, your director.

02:54.400 --> 02:56.800
I've just returned from North Africa

02:56.880 --> 03:00.400
where I directed
a local-cast production of  Hamlet.

03:00.480 --> 03:02.680
Now, that  is  swish.

03:02.760 --> 03:05.120
[all laugh]

03:05.200 --> 03:07.960
Were the sets made of sand? [laughs]

03:10.000 --> 03:11.360
Such a prick.

03:11.440 --> 03:14.520
-Your turn.
-Steven Toast, and I'm playing Jeff.

03:14.600 --> 03:16.840
Something interesting about yourself,
Steven.

03:16.920 --> 03:18.080
[exhales]

03:19.240 --> 03:22.480
Oh, yeah, I can roll my eyes
into the back of my head.

03:25.800 --> 03:28.680
Useful for drama and comedy,
I should think.

03:29.560 --> 03:34.560
Now, before we open the text,
I'd like us to loosen up and focus

03:34.640 --> 03:39.440
using something called a shaka,
which is a warm-up I learnt in Africa.

03:39.520 --> 03:40.400
Great.

03:44.360 --> 03:48.440
Ooga shaka ooga ooga ooga shaka

03:48.520 --> 03:50.960
-Ooga ooga
-[Kika]  Ooga shaka

03:51.040 --> 03:53.280
-Ooga ooga
-[Ray] Ooga shaka

03:53.360 --> 03:57.440
Ooga ooga ooga shaka
Ooga ooga ooga shaka

03:57.520 --> 03:59.880
-Sorry, you've got to be fucking kidding.
-OK!

04:01.320 --> 04:03.680
If you wanna shit on me, I'll shit on you!

04:04.480 --> 04:08.240
But you better be wearing
a fucking helmet!

04:12.040 --> 04:13.240
[door slams]

04:13.320 --> 04:15.920
It was like the Special Olympics.

04:16.000 --> 04:20.279
But the Special Olympics for arseholes.
[laughs]

04:21.120 --> 04:23.720
Yes. All right.
Bye, bye, bye, bye.

04:24.520 --> 04:28.160
And as I was saying, the last person
I wanted to see there was Ray Purchase!

04:28.640 --> 04:31.040
And that director's fucking crackers!

04:31.120 --> 04:34.960
Acker is very highly strung,
but he inspires fierce loyalty.

04:35.040 --> 04:38.640
Even when he killed one of his actors, the
rest of the cast remained devoted to him.

04:38.720 --> 04:41.520
-I'm not saying he lacks charisma.
-He's passionate.

04:41.600 --> 04:43.760
-Sorry, did you say he killed an actor?
-[Jane] Yes!

04:43.840 --> 04:47.120
On some Pinter play about ten years ago.
He  killed  an actor.

04:47.200 --> 04:50.280
Christ! Well, even Pinter
wouldn't do that!

04:50.360 --> 04:54.720
The actor, can't remember his name,
wasn't much cop from what I can remember.

04:54.800 --> 04:57.840
Anyway, he wouldn't do what Acker wanted,
so Acker stabbed him.

04:57.920 --> 05:01.760
Actor died, but Acker got away
with manslaughter.

05:01.840 --> 05:03.040
Good grief!

05:03.120 --> 05:06.760
The judge had seen his  Trojan Women
at the National and was a huge fan,

05:06.840 --> 05:08.200
-so he got off!
-You know what?

05:08.280 --> 05:11.400
I'm not sure I should be working
with a director that murders actors.

05:11.480 --> 05:14.040
Well, it might undo the damage
of you being in that play.

05:14.120 --> 05:16.040
Everyone hates that play.

05:16.120 --> 05:20.600
-Feels worse than being a pedophile!
-Really, Toast! What a thing to say,

05:20.680 --> 05:22.240
in the current climate!

05:22.320 --> 05:24.360
Well, you put me
in that bloody play, Jane!

05:24.440 --> 05:25.760
-I didn't wanna do it!
-[phone rings]

05:25.840 --> 05:27.320
-Oh!
-Jane Plough.

05:27.400 --> 05:31.200
-Spelt P-L-O-U-G-H. Pronounced "Pluff."
-[laughs]

05:32.080 --> 05:34.680
-He's very much a family man.
-Who?

05:35.520 --> 05:37.600
But the '70s was ages ago.

05:37.680 --> 05:39.600
-He probably doesn't remem...
-Who?

05:39.680 --> 05:42.960
Just one moment, please. Scotland Yard
are investigating another client.

05:43.040 --> 05:45.480
-Could you just slink off?
-[sighs]

05:46.800 --> 05:50.720
Ah, hello.
Yes, I saw your advert on the computer,

05:50.800 --> 05:54.120
and I'd quite like a...

05:54.200 --> 05:55.480
A... blonde, yes, yes.

05:55.560 --> 05:58.480
Blonde is my favorite color. Ha!

05:58.560 --> 06:03.320
So we could meet tomorrow at 4.00 p.m.
at the Baybury Hotel, South Kensington.

06:04.400 --> 06:05.960
I'm a traveling salesman.

06:06.520 --> 06:08.520
Look, how much will it cost?

06:10.040 --> 06:11.360
No, I'm not VAT registered.

06:12.960 --> 06:16.200
OK, my name is Royce Coolidge.

06:16.760 --> 06:18.400
And her name is Lorry?

06:18.840 --> 06:21.080
What, L-O-R-R-Y...

06:21.160 --> 06:24.720
No... L-O-R-I. I see.

06:25.480 --> 06:27.040
No, I don't have a loyalty card.

06:28.040 --> 06:29.600
Thanking you.

06:30.760 --> 06:31.800
Ooh.

06:31.880 --> 06:34.080
£400.

06:35.000 --> 06:36.120
Mmm!

06:37.880 --> 06:39.120
Pretty good!

06:39.200 --> 06:41.760
-Steven?!
-Greta!

06:41.840 --> 06:45.640
-I didn't recognize you with that.
-I fell out of a tree. You're gorgeous.

06:45.720 --> 06:47.920
-I mean, you look gorgeous.
-How's Ellen?

06:48.000 --> 06:49.560
-Who?
-Your wife?

06:49.640 --> 06:51.760
My soon-to-be ex-wife, actually.

06:51.840 --> 06:53.480
I'm a gay divorcee!

06:53.560 --> 06:55.400
I'm not gay. Are you still acting?

06:55.480 --> 06:56.920
Nah, not as much.

06:57.000 --> 06:58.880
-That's a shame, you're quite good.
-[sighs]

06:58.960 --> 07:01.000
How's fuckface, what's his name, Gary?

07:01.080 --> 07:02.960
Mmm, yeah, we're divorced too.

07:03.040 --> 07:05.720
I'm going to my club for a cocktail.
Do you fancy joining me?

07:06.840 --> 07:08.840
-Umm...
-Oh, come on!

07:10.080 --> 07:11.440
-Yeah, all right.
-Yes!

07:14.280 --> 07:16.120
So you're a TV producer now?

07:16.200 --> 07:17.920
What are you working on these days?

07:18.000 --> 07:19.200
A documentary.

07:19.280 --> 07:21.360
A six-part thing.
It's called  London Lives.

07:21.440 --> 07:24.000
It's kind of about the dark underbelly
of the capital.

07:24.080 --> 07:25.600
[coughs] Sounds good.

07:26.360 --> 07:28.680
Yeah, but it's just a job, you know?

07:28.760 --> 07:30.640
I prefer getting my kicks in other ways.

07:30.720 --> 07:32.680
[laughs suggestively] I remember!

07:32.760 --> 07:36.440
I like trying new things.
I'm an excitement junkie.

07:37.320 --> 07:40.560
Me too.
Should we meet up again next week?

07:40.640 --> 07:43.360
Yeah. Why don't I just give you my card?

07:43.440 --> 07:44.720
[inhales deeply]

07:44.800 --> 07:47.360
-Shall we say Friday, provisionally?
-Yes!

07:47.800 --> 07:49.120
So why don't you ring me,

07:49.200 --> 07:50.680
-and we'll hook up?
-Yes!

07:53.000 --> 07:55.640
I think Steven should lead the shaka.

07:56.400 --> 07:57.720
Oh, fuck.

08:01.240 --> 08:04.360
Ooga shaka ooga ooga ooga shaka

08:04.440 --> 08:08.600
Ooga ooga ooga shaka
ooga ooga ooga shaka

08:08.680 --> 08:11.240
Ooga ooga ooga shaka ooga ooga--

08:11.320 --> 08:13.160
Excuse me, please!

08:15.080 --> 08:18.240
-[door slams]
-What the hell's up with him?

08:18.320 --> 08:22.240
You know he murdered an actor. What?

08:22.320 --> 08:24.400
I'd keep your stupid mouth shut
about that, Toast!

08:24.480 --> 08:26.760
-But he was murdered!
-It was manslaughter.

08:26.840 --> 08:28.960
A second-rate actor
gets killed by the director.

08:29.040 --> 08:30.720
No big deal. Happens every day.

08:30.800 --> 08:33.080
-Does it?
-I really wouldn't mention it again Toast.

08:33.159 --> 08:34.280
-Steven
-[cries out]

08:34.360 --> 08:35.559
Quick word.

08:37.080 --> 08:38.080
You're fucked.

08:38.159 --> 08:39.600
[ominous music]

08:40.440 --> 08:43.280
-You're trying to undermine me. Why?
-What?

08:43.360 --> 08:46.440
I expect total loyalty from my actors
at all times.

08:46.520 --> 08:50.840
I feel for any project to work, I need to
have them just where I want them.

08:50.920 --> 08:52.680
By the balls!

08:52.760 --> 08:54.120
By the balls, eh?

08:54.200 --> 08:55.520
Quick question.

08:55.600 --> 08:58.640
-Have you ever had anybody by the balls?
-Literally?

08:58.720 --> 09:02.680
Yes, I mean literally to feel
another man's cojones

09:02.760 --> 09:06.800
lying in the palm of one's hand.
Ever had that experience, Steven?

09:06.880 --> 09:08.800
I can't say I have. You?

09:08.880 --> 09:12.400
Yes, I have. With Benedict Cumberbatch!

09:12.480 --> 09:16.360
-Who?
-I felt them literally rolling around

09:16.440 --> 09:19.400
both of us staring into each other's eyes.

09:19.480 --> 09:23.920
It seemed like an eternity,
but it was less than half an hour!

09:24.920 --> 09:27.520
He cracked in the end.

09:27.600 --> 09:29.680
-We did it my way.
-[sniggers]

09:29.760 --> 09:31.440
I'm not joking, Steven!

09:31.520 --> 09:34.640
This isn't  Michael McIntyre's
Comedy Roadshow!

09:34.720 --> 09:40.720
And when I say literally,
I do of course literally mean literally!

09:48.320 --> 09:50.040
[Toast runs out]

09:58.400 --> 10:00.120
[Australian man] Check this one out, mate!

10:00.200 --> 10:01.720
Over here, you great galah!

10:03.200 --> 10:04.600
-[branch snaps]
-Jesus Christ!

10:04.680 --> 10:05.920
We need to talk to you, Toast!

10:06.000 --> 10:09.280
You are in serious danger of jeopardizing
this production because you hate Acker.

10:09.360 --> 10:11.200
-Do you hate Acker?
-I hardly know the man!

10:11.280 --> 10:13.600
He believes you're not
showing him the requisite loyalty.

10:13.680 --> 10:16.600
-He needs a lot of reassurance.
-Now, I have to ask you something else.

10:16.680 --> 10:17.800
-Confidentially.
-What?

10:17.880 --> 10:19.960
-You know about another murder?
-What other murder?

10:20.040 --> 10:22.320
Ray, don't ask him if he knows
about the other murder.

10:22.400 --> 10:23.840
But I thought you said--

10:23.920 --> 10:25.720
I wasn't gonna ask him
about the other murder.

10:25.800 --> 10:28.080
I was gonna ask him
about the extra rehearsal on Saturday.

10:28.160 --> 10:30.640
-You don't know about that, do you?
-The extra rehearsal?

10:30.720 --> 10:34.000
-No, the other murder.
-Stop mentioning that, Ray!

10:34.080 --> 10:37.040
-Anyway, you don't know about it, do you?
-What?

10:37.120 --> 10:39.040
The thing Ray mentioned
but shouldn't have.

10:39.120 --> 10:41.400
I don't know anything!
This is fucking ridiculous!

10:41.480 --> 10:43.600
That's good. Don't tell anyone about it.

10:43.680 --> 10:45.000
-Look, if someone's...
-[thump]

10:45.720 --> 10:48.200
Sorry, mate!
Can we have our Frisbee back?

10:50.240 --> 10:52.960
-What the...
-You wanna join in?

10:56.480 --> 10:57.840
Ah, good catch.

11:01.080 --> 11:02.160
[screams]

11:02.240 --> 11:03.720
That's for fucking my wife

11:03.800 --> 11:06.200
and for making me look
like a dog's nut back there!

11:09.040 --> 11:13.440
So the implication was
that Acker's murdered someone else?

11:13.520 --> 11:15.320
I got that distinct impression.

11:15.400 --> 11:18.240
I think Ray Purchase got cack-mouthed
and revealed it in error.

11:18.320 --> 11:19.480
Very odd.

11:19.560 --> 11:22.560
-Well, shouldn't we contact the police?
-Well, with murders,

11:22.640 --> 11:25.560
once you get the police in,
things can get complicated.

11:25.640 --> 11:29.040
I agree. If ever I heard about a murder,
I wouldn't contact the police.

11:29.120 --> 11:31.040
Why not? Overcrowded prisons?

11:31.120 --> 11:33.440
No. Much along the lines
of what you've just said.

11:33.520 --> 11:36.320
Once you get the police involved
with a murder, things can escalate.

11:37.680 --> 11:40.640
Look, you have to get me
out of this Acker play.

11:40.720 --> 11:43.040
I mean, tell him anything.
Tell him I've got VD.

11:43.120 --> 11:45.920
Where would you get it?
You haven't been exactly active recently.

11:46.000 --> 11:47.840
-[both laugh]
-Yeah

11:47.920 --> 11:50.480
[Jane] Now listen, Toast,
it's important you don't cross Acker.

11:50.560 --> 11:53.000
You just do what he says.
You don't want him as an enemy.

11:53.080 --> 11:54.400
Now bugger off, Toast.

11:54.480 --> 11:56.760
I've got Strawberry Rathbone
popping in in 15 minutes.

11:56.840 --> 11:58.640
If she sees you here, there'll be a scene.

11:58.720 --> 12:02.400
A scene, you say.
That'll be a first for her in a while.

12:02.480 --> 12:03.840
[Toast laughs]

12:11.360 --> 12:12.480
[yells]

12:12.560 --> 12:15.680
Jesus Christ, Ed. What are you playing at?

12:15.760 --> 12:17.480
Sorry, Toast. Didn't know my own strength.

12:17.560 --> 12:19.840
Fire and fucking blast, not again!

12:19.920 --> 12:22.480
Language violation, Toast. You all right?

12:22.560 --> 12:25.720
Well, if it's the crown jewels
you're referring to, Ed, not good.

12:25.800 --> 12:29.720
OK. Ladies and gentlemen,
play is suspended. Thank you.

12:30.960 --> 12:34.880
-Something on your mind, Toast?
-Do you remember Greta Cargo from RADA?

12:34.960 --> 12:37.640
Oh, yeah. Very much into sex, if I recall.

12:37.720 --> 12:40.920
I bumped into her on the street.
Always thought she was great.

12:41.000 --> 12:43.200
In fact, that's an anagram of her name:
Great.

12:43.280 --> 12:45.040
Just swap the "A" and the "T."

12:45.120 --> 12:46.760
-It's a very simple one but...
-So it is.

12:46.840 --> 12:51.160
Anyway, I've created a bit of a problem
for myself. I've contacted an agency.

12:51.240 --> 12:54.720
-An estate agency?
-No, a different kind of agency.

12:54.800 --> 12:58.240
-Travel agency?
-What? No, an escort agency.

12:58.320 --> 13:00.240
Oh, I see.

13:00.320 --> 13:02.120
Well, lots of chaps use agencies.

13:02.200 --> 13:04.440
I've read about it.
I mean, you might have done it.

13:04.960 --> 13:06.880
-I haven't done it!
-Well, that's fine. I--

13:06.960 --> 13:09.120
-Yeah, but I haven't done it!
-OK, if you had--

13:09.200 --> 13:10.800
-I honestly haven't done it.
-All right!

13:12.120 --> 13:17.640
So, I'm meeting this escort in this posh
hotel in South Ken tomorrow. I can't wait.

13:17.720 --> 13:19.360
Does a great afternoon tea as well.

13:19.440 --> 13:23.360
So this is the dilemma, if I hook up
with the escort, the sex is guaranteed.

13:23.440 --> 13:27.280
If I meet Greta and nothing happens,
I'll shit out and be doubly disappointed.

13:27.560 --> 13:29.040
-You want my advice?
-Yeah.

13:29.120 --> 13:31.560
-Go where the sex is.
-That's exactly what I was thinking.

13:31.640 --> 13:33.280
After all, it's only what, £400?

13:34.240 --> 13:37.200
-£400. How do you know?
-Guess.

13:38.120 --> 13:39.240
Well, you're spot on.

13:39.320 --> 13:41.680
It was a guess, Toast. Just a guess.

13:41.760 --> 13:44.440
[groans suspiciously]

13:44.520 --> 13:45.640
Guess!

13:45.720 --> 13:51.600
[Toast] Reception? Hello, yes
I'm the traveling salesman from room 560.

13:51.680 --> 13:53.040
I'm expecting a visitor.

13:53.120 --> 13:55.800
She's blonde, and her name is Lori.

13:55.880 --> 13:59.600
Just... I'll be here.
Just ring up, I'll come straight down.

14:00.760 --> 14:02.160
[phone rings]

14:04.760 --> 14:05.720
Toast.

14:05.800 --> 14:09.360
Toast, it's Acker Herron.
Meet me at the Olympian Club.

14:09.440 --> 14:10.440
You wanna meet now?

14:10.520 --> 14:11.840
-Yes, now!
-But I have to--

14:11.920 --> 14:14.200
I wouldn't waste our time
unless it was important.

14:14.280 --> 14:16.840
-I can't, I've got a--
-I'll text you the address.

14:18.040 --> 14:21.720
What the fu...
Who the shit does he think he is?

14:22.120 --> 14:23.360
[doorbell rings]

14:29.960 --> 14:34.160
Fencing tells one so much about a fellow.
About his commitment, his loyalty,

14:34.240 --> 14:36.520
about how much of a man he is.

14:36.600 --> 14:39.880
Do we have to? I have
an afternoon tea appointment at four.

14:40.760 --> 14:41.960
God.

14:49.280 --> 14:51.280
You have a natural talent, Toast.

14:51.360 --> 14:53.600
I like to think I've mastered
the basic skills.

14:56.040 --> 14:57.360
[screams]

14:57.440 --> 14:58.800
-That hurt, did it?
-Shit!

14:58.880 --> 15:00.880
Your suit's fitted
with electronic sensors.

15:00.960 --> 15:04.800
A direct hit results
in a massive electric shock.

15:04.880 --> 15:06.560
Enough to kill a small dog.

15:06.640 --> 15:08.520
What the hell are you playing at?

15:08.600 --> 15:10.040
I'm testing you out, Toast!

15:10.120 --> 15:13.920
I want to make sure
you're the kind of man I can rely on!

15:19.880 --> 15:22.680
[screams]

15:22.760 --> 15:24.800
[electric buzzing]

15:24.880 --> 15:26.040
[Toast whimpers]

15:26.120 --> 15:28.920
[laughs manically]

15:29.960 --> 15:31.800
[Acker] I think you proved yourself
out there.

15:31.880 --> 15:33.880
You passed part one of the test.

15:33.960 --> 15:38.000
Part one?
I dread to think what part two entails.

15:39.320 --> 15:40.320
Of course.

15:40.400 --> 15:42.480
Yes, it's me, Toast.

15:42.560 --> 15:46.120
Ray fucking Purchase,
your worst nightmare.

15:46.200 --> 15:47.640
[gasps]

15:47.720 --> 15:49.000
How does that feel, Toast?

15:49.080 --> 15:50.560
Grab the other one, Ray.

15:50.640 --> 15:51.640
-[grunts]
-[gasps]

15:52.200 --> 15:54.760
Cumberbatch lasted less than half an hour.

15:54.840 --> 15:57.720
-Who?
-Fassbender barely 20 minutes.

15:58.520 --> 16:02.000
You think it's clever, do you?
Grabbing a man's balls in the shower.

16:02.080 --> 16:04.080
You're pathetic. Both of you.

16:04.160 --> 16:09.400
We're not letting go, Toast.
We're going to break your balls.

16:09.480 --> 16:12.840
-Metaphorically and literally.
-[squeaks]

16:17.560 --> 16:21.040
Forty-five minutes. I'm impressed.

16:21.120 --> 16:24.120
-What time's your appointment?
-Four o'clock.

16:24.200 --> 16:27.680
And it's crucial I don't arrive at this
particular appointment with crushed nuts.

16:27.760 --> 16:31.800
[yelps] I think you've made your point.

16:31.880 --> 16:35.320
Do you swear total loyalty to me
and to the production?

16:35.400 --> 16:37.240
Yes!

16:37.320 --> 16:39.240
-[laughs]
-[sighs]

16:39.320 --> 16:43.560
I just know we're going to achieve
great things with this play.

16:43.640 --> 16:46.200
This is a terrible time for theater.

16:46.280 --> 16:49.160
Have you heard about that shit
that's on at the Playhouse?

16:49.240 --> 16:51.560
It's everything I hate.

16:51.640 --> 16:56.880
All the actors in that should be
stripped naked, shot, and shat on.

16:57.760 --> 16:59.560
Hang on a second.

16:59.640 --> 17:00.760
Toast's in that play.

17:03.600 --> 17:06.440
You're in that play.
He's in that play, Acker.

17:07.680 --> 17:12.280
OK. Well, that's...
that's rather disappointing.

17:13.480 --> 17:18.280
Give me a moment.
I just need to think about strategy here.

17:19.599 --> 17:21.200
I'll be back in a minute.

17:23.599 --> 17:25.280
Why are you such a grass, Purchase?

17:25.359 --> 17:29.480
Look, if you're in some shit play,
Acker needs to know about it!

17:29.560 --> 17:33.160
You can't resist it, can you?
Poking that big nose of yours in.

17:33.240 --> 17:35.120
You're such a fucking prick!

17:35.200 --> 17:39.360
Ray, please leave. This could turn ugly.

17:40.680 --> 17:45.240
-I wouldn't mind staying.
-Leave! I don't want any witnesses.

17:45.320 --> 17:49.200
-And lock all the doors behind you.
-OK.

17:50.520 --> 17:52.600
[mouths] You're fucked.

17:53.800 --> 17:59.320
So, just you and me, Toast.

17:59.400 --> 18:02.160
Shouldn't I put my fencing outfit on?

18:02.480 --> 18:06.080
-Actually, you're wearing mine with the--
-We're not doing fencing anymore, Toast.

18:06.160 --> 18:11.200
We're doing killing. This is what you get
for doing shit theater.

18:11.280 --> 18:13.960
You're going to die. [laughs manically]

18:16.000 --> 18:17.680
OK, you win, Acker.

18:18.200 --> 18:21.040
Is it not customary to give
a condemned man a last request?

18:21.920 --> 18:23.400
OK, what is it?

18:24.600 --> 18:26.200
We've left the shower on.

18:26.960 --> 18:30.160
I hate wasting water
and you wouldn't mind turning it off.

18:31.000 --> 18:36.240
Fine. No, it's good to be concerned
about environmental issues. All right.

18:36.320 --> 18:40.680
Ray Purchase has locked all the doors
so you can't escape.

18:40.760 --> 18:42.240
Resistance would be futile.

18:42.320 --> 18:44.200
Yes.

18:46.760 --> 18:49.600
-[electric buzzing]
-[Acker screams]

18:49.680 --> 18:53.160
I'm guessing the rehearsal's canceled.
Ha!

18:53.240 --> 18:54.960
[Toast] Reception?

18:55.040 --> 18:59.200
Hello, yes, I'm the traveling salesman
from room 560.

18:59.280 --> 19:01.400
Shit, I've forgotten my name.

19:01.480 --> 19:06.640
Look, look, if someone comes to the hotel
asking for the name of a guest

19:06.720 --> 19:09.320
who isn't a resident,
it'll probably be for me.

19:12.000 --> 19:14.400
[snores]

19:16.120 --> 19:17.720
[phone rings]

19:19.480 --> 19:20.480
Hello?

19:21.120 --> 19:23.200
Royce Coolidge. Yes, that's who I am!

19:23.280 --> 19:27.360
Yes, she... fantastic.
I'll be straight down. Thanking you.

19:28.400 --> 19:30.040
[chatter]

19:35.800 --> 19:38.520
-Greta.
-Steven.

19:38.600 --> 19:40.120
-Hello, again.
-Oh, yeah.

19:40.200 --> 19:44.960
I'm just here meeting an old male...
man school friend.

19:45.040 --> 19:47.480
I hear the afternoon tea's great.
What are you doing here?

19:47.560 --> 19:48.600
I'm working.

19:48.680 --> 19:51.080
-Working?
-Yes, I'm meeting someone.

19:51.160 --> 19:54.840
They're called a "John" in the trade.
I should explain.

19:54.920 --> 19:57.400
No, no, no, no, no, no.
This is amazing.

19:57.480 --> 20:01.320
Has it got anything to do
with an [whispers] escort agency?

20:01.400 --> 20:03.200
-Yes.
-[laughs loudly]

20:05.720 --> 20:09.960
Can't say I'm surprised.
You were always pretty adventurous.

20:10.040 --> 20:12.800
-Shall we?
-I'm not sure what you mean, Steven.

20:12.880 --> 20:15.120
This is part of the documentary series
I'm producing.

20:15.200 --> 20:17.520
-We're here with that woman over there.
-[Toast] Ooh.

20:17.600 --> 20:19.640
We're hoping to interview
the man she's meeting.

20:19.720 --> 20:23.040
In fact, he's on his way down as we speak
so if you could just...

20:24.760 --> 20:28.280
Hang on, how did you know
