06:29.305 --> 06:31.140
- There is a film on them.
- Yeah, but--

06:31.140 --> 06:32.225

07:22.775 --> 07:25.403
kill all of you, and then leave.

07:25.403 --> 07:27.405
Why would you tell them that?

07:27.989 --> 07:29.907
And now, with all our guns out?

So, you read my proposal?

10:00.933 --> 10:02.643
About the Maisles?

10:03.311 --> 10:05.396
It's pronounced "MyAisles."
"My" and "aisles" pushed together.

10:05.396 --> 10:06.689
Any supermarket, any city,

10:06.689 --> 10:09.609
MyAisles app will tell you the aisle

10:11.777 --> 10:13.988

10:13.988 --> 10:15.615

10:47.229 --> 10:48.147
Okay.

10:50.149 --> 10:51.150
I'm so sorry I'm late,

10:51.150 --> 10:55.446

10:55.446 --> 10:56.739

10:57.239 --> 10:58.824

- Sure.

11:00.743 --> 11:02.828
- Just making some bruschetta. Here.
- Okay.

11:02.828 --> 11:04.413
So how was your trip?

11:04.413 --> 11:06.123
Oh, don't ask me.

11:06.123 --> 11:08.334
No one wants to lift
heavy weights anymore.

11:08.334 --> 11:11.128
Everyone wants to go biking
with their digital friends.

11:12.505 --> 11:16.050
Can't wait to sell my half of the business
to Barry and to be done with it.

11:18.594 --> 11:19.428
What?

11:20.554 --> 11:21.430
I'm serious.

11:21.430 --> 11:23.516
This time I'm really gonna hang up
the lifting belt.

11:23.516 --> 11:25.810
- If you say so.

11:25.810 --> 11:27.144
Now when is Emma getting here?

11:27.144 --> 11:28.979
Soon. She had to go pick up Carter.

11:28.979 --> 11:30.731
His car's in the shop again.

11:33.776 --> 11:35.986
You know, a real man can fix his own car.

11:35.986 --> 11:39.281
Luke, get it out of your system
before he gets here. I'm warning you.

11:40.241 --> 11:42.785
I'll try, but for your sake, not his.

11:44.453 --> 11:47.540

11:54.797 --> 11:55.923

11:56.882 --> 11:59.635
She doesn't like that.
She likes "Romi."

11:59.635 --> 12:01.011
- Right.
-  Mm-hm.

12:01.595 --> 12:03.597
-  I missed you.
-  I missed you too.

12:03.597 --> 12:05.933
I brought you
a little gift from my trip, okay?

12:05.933 --> 12:07.059
Okay.

12:09.186 --> 12:10.604
- Ta-da.
- Wow.

12:11.188 --> 12:13.941
You hide this in your jewelry box,
and when you're 18 years old,

12:13.941 --> 12:15.985
I'll get you a really beautiful gift, okay?

12:16.777 --> 12:18.946
- Love you.
-  Love you too.

12:18.946 --> 12:22.700
That is a Congolese warlord's diamond.
It's supposed to go into evidence.

12:22.700 --> 12:23.826
It was just one.

12:23.826 --> 12:26.245
-  Sorry we're late.
-  Hey, there we are.

12:26.245 --> 12:28.122
-  What's all this?
- Emma.

12:29.373 --> 12:31.625
- Dad.
<i>- Schatzel.</i>

12:32.918 --> 12:34.628
- Oh, I missed you.

12:34.628 --> 12:36.005
I missed you too.

12:39.216 --> 12:40.092
Now you're leaving.

12:40.092 --> 12:42.678
I know,
but for even better reasons than before.

12:42.678 --> 12:45.222
I lobbied the governing body
of La Guajira,

12:45.222 --> 12:47.433
and I just learned
they accepted our program.

12:47.433 --> 12:49.769
So fresh water
to five times as many Colombians.

12:49.769 --> 12:51.645
Wow, that is fantastic.

12:51.645 --> 12:53.522
- Congratulations.

12:53.522 --> 12:55.399
They should call her the aqueduct.

12:59.487 --> 13:01.113
'Cause she delivers the water.

13:05.326 --> 13:07.912
- Are you ready to be blown away?
- Okay.

13:07.912 --> 13:08.954
- Stay right here.
- Okay.

13:08.954 --> 13:10.080
Okay? All right.

13:12.416 --> 13:13.918
- I'm sorry.
- I thought it was funny.

13:13.918 --> 13:15.127
- I laughed.
- Thank you.

13:15.127 --> 13:16.587
Surprise.

13:17.338 --> 13:18.214
Wow.

13:18.214 --> 13:20.382
Oh, um... Ow!

13:20.382 --> 13:21.675
-  You okay?
- Yeah, yeah.

13:21.675 --> 13:23.302
- Your shoulder okay?
- Yeah.

13:23.302 --> 13:27.014
Yeah, it's fine.
I, um, I messed it up roller skating.

13:27.014 --> 13:29.683
But I can still open presents.

13:30.309 --> 13:34.021
It's a stand-up mixer
for the Sunday Funday bake-offs.

13:34.021 --> 13:37.233
- Like the good old days, huh?
- Dad, I love it.

13:37.233 --> 13:38.859
And I love you.

13:39.527 --> 13:42.696
You always got straight A's,
first chair violin,

13:42.696 --> 13:45.324
no smoking, no drinking, no cursing.

13:45.324 --> 13:48.911
And now you're providing water
to millions more people.

13:48.911 --> 13:51.622
It's one more reason
to be so proud of you.

13:52.206 --> 13:53.332
But I have to tell ya,

13:53.874 --> 13:56.460
I'm a little bit concerned
about this La Guajira.

13:56.460 --> 13:59.380
- It's a very volatile area.
- How do you know about that?

13:59.380 --> 14:02.299
My daughter says she's going to Colombia,
I Googled it.

14:02.883 --> 14:07.012
Um, actually, the Global Fund has them
in a very secure location, Mr. Brunner,

14:07.012 --> 14:11.517
um, and, statistically, most kidnappings
tend to be of American men.

14:11.517 --> 14:13.269
That's great. Then you should go with her.

14:13.269 --> 14:14.311
Luke...

14:14.311 --> 14:17.314
I would absolutely love to,
but I gotta stay here and work.

14:17.314 --> 14:20.401
Yeah, kindergarten teacher.
Those paintings don't finger themselves.

14:20.401 --> 14:21.318
Dad.

14:21.318 --> 14:23.237
Seriously? No crunchies?

14:23.237 --> 14:25.281
It's not cake time yet, Barry.

14:25.281 --> 14:27.449
One slice, Uncle Barry. Your heart.

14:27.449 --> 14:29.451
It's the recital all over again.

14:30.661 --> 14:32.204
This cake is bullshit.

14:33.038 --> 14:34.582
Dad, I'll be fine.

14:34.582 --> 14:38.586
And I hope you know,
I couldn't have done this without you.

14:39.128 --> 14:40.087
Hm.

14:40.713 --> 14:44.049
You've always encouraged me
and taught me to reach beyond my grasp,

14:44.049 --> 14:45.050
and...

14:47.011 --> 14:48.804
I didn't get here by myself.

14:51.724 --> 14:55.686
I have a great idea. I'll go to the store
and get some cupcake mix,

14:55.686 --> 14:57.521
and we break in the mixer.

14:57.521 --> 14:59.523
- Chocolate fudge swirl?
- I'll be right back, okay?

14:59.523 --> 15:01.025
- Okay.

15:02.693 --> 15:06.155
I told him you wanted
a mortar and pestle to make Indian food.

15:07.281 --> 15:09.074
- He doesn't listen.

15:09.074 --> 15:11.869
- One of the many reasons I divorced him.

15:14.663 --> 15:17.541
- Yeah, but he always tries his best.
- Yeah.

15:17.541 --> 15:19.752
I love it, 'cause it's from him.

15:29.845 --> 15:33.265
<i>♪ What a fool believes... ♪</i>

15:33.807 --> 15:34.642
Mm.

15:35.142 --> 15:36.268
I know, it's good.

15:36.769 --> 15:39.730
So how are you gonna spend
your golden years, huh?

15:39.730 --> 15:42.191
- Lots of mall walking?
- Learning the Facebook?

15:42.191 --> 15:44.360
Getting vaccinated
for pneumococcal pneumonia?

15:44.360 --> 15:45.778
Wilford Brimley Film Festival.

15:45.778 --> 15:47.279
Are you gonna campaign
for Grover Cleveland?

15:47.279 --> 15:49.073
You want to know what I've planned?

15:49.073 --> 15:51.450
Here. Look at this.

15:52.618 --> 15:55.120
The Oden 410.
You know, from the sting in Panama?

15:55.120 --> 15:56.038
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

15:56.038 --> 15:58.207
Well, the CIA said I can have it.

15:58.207 --> 16:01.418
They gave that to you?
I couldn't get a humidifier for my office.

16:01.418 --> 16:05.965
Tally and I, we've talked about sailing
around the world together for ages.

16:06.632 --> 16:09.343
Now since I'm retired,
what's gonna stop us?

16:09.343 --> 16:12.096
- Fifteen-year-old divorce papers?
- She doesn't love you anymore?

16:12.096 --> 16:13.973
The job's why we got divorced.

16:13.973 --> 16:16.892
All the lies,
leaving in a moment's notice,

16:16.892 --> 16:18.310
never having been around.

16:18.310 --> 16:20.646
The CIA destroys relationships.

16:20.646 --> 16:24.733
I've been waiting for a decade and a half
to win my wife back.

16:24.733 --> 16:28.862
Tally and I, we're gonna make love
deckside before the summer is over.

16:28.862 --> 16:31.281
Hm. I will never step foot on that boat.

16:31.281 --> 16:32.908
It's not a boat. It's a ship.

16:32.908 --> 16:35.661
- Luke, can I talk to you for a minute?
- Sure.

16:36.912 --> 16:40.124
Hey, Aldon, Roo,
feel free to visit me at the marina.

16:40.708 --> 16:42.668
You can scrape the barnacles
off my dinghy.

16:42.668 --> 16:43.585
Ew.

16:44.253 --> 16:46.005
- He's toast.
- Yeah.

16:46.005 --> 16:49.591
That man survived a Russian mob hit,
but that Tally plan is gonna kill him.

16:50.217 --> 16:53.303
And if it does,
I'm totally going after his ex.

16:53.303 --> 16:54.555
Same.

16:55.139 --> 16:58.684
If this is about the crunchies,
I swear to you, I ordered them.

17:03.147 --> 17:05.149
We're gonna lose an operative.

17:05.733 --> 17:07.234
- Who?
- Code name's Panda.

17:07.234 --> 17:08.986
Been embedded in Guyana for a while now.

17:10.738 --> 17:13.615
with Lape Pa Lanmo.

17:15.367 --> 17:17.244
Remember this friendly face?

17:17.244 --> 17:18.328
Omar Polonia?

17:18.328 --> 17:21.790
I killed that son of a bitch 25 years ago
in Operation Jungle Book.

17:21.790 --> 17:23.500
Not him, his son.

17:23.500 --> 17:24.668
Boro?

17:24.668 --> 17:26.962
Seems Papa's death motivated him.

17:26.962 --> 17:29.339
Dedicated his life
to finishing what Daddy started.

17:29.339 --> 17:33.218
That's impossible. I got him into
a boarding school in London.

17:33.218 --> 17:35.554
- I know.
- He was going to study business.

17:37.181 --> 17:38.849
He was going to be different than his dad.

17:38.849 --> 17:40.184
You got half of what you wanted.

17:40.184 --> 17:42.144
Graduated high school at 16,

17:42.144 --> 17:43.562
Oxford at 20,

17:43.562 --> 17:45.272
MBA from Wharton at 22,

17:45.272 --> 17:47.399
all geared towards funding,
continuing and growing

17:47.399 --> 17:49.735
what's left of his father's
paramilitary organization.

17:49.735 --> 17:52.529
Lape Pa Lanmo now has over 400 members,

17:52.529 --> 17:55.824
many living on his compound,
completely devoted to Boro,

17:55.824 --> 17:57.993
the son of their fallen leader,

17:57.993 --> 18:00.788
and to his cause of augmenting
their wealth, power, and influence

18:00.788 --> 18:02.247
through illegal arms sales.

18:04.166 --> 18:06.335
Specifically, with this suitcase nuke.

18:06.335 --> 18:09.713
Complete with the reflector beryllium
to reduce fissile material mass,

18:09.713 --> 18:10.631
thereby making it...

18:10.631 --> 18:13.550
A WMD that can be taken anywhere,

18:14.134 --> 18:16.345
and now Boro pulled it off.

18:16.345 --> 18:19.973
Parental murder seems to be
quite the inspirational tool.

18:19.973 --> 18:22.768
It's not my fault that the kid went south.

18:22.768 --> 18:24.645
I even waited for him
to get off the compound

18:24.645 --> 18:26.730
before I threw his father off the cliff.

18:27.523 --> 18:28.690
Trying to be nice.

18:29.608 --> 18:30.901
Boro has a man Troy.

18:30.901 --> 18:33.445
He's in Yemen
meeting a potential bidder for the nuke.

18:33.445 --> 18:34.947
Seems Boro's gonna hold an auction,

18:34.947 --> 18:36.573
where the world's biggest and baddest

18:36.573 --> 18:38.826
are gonna try to get their hands
on his weapon.

18:38.826 --> 18:41.370
Intel says Troy's ascertained
Panda as a plant.

18:41.370 --> 18:43.038
- Then pull the officer.
- We can't.

18:43.038 --> 18:44.373
We've lost communication<i>,</i>

18:44.373 --> 18:48.168
and since Boro forbids calls
from the Middle East for security reasons,

18:48.168 --> 18:51.713
we have 36 hours till Troy's back
in Guyana and exposes Panda.

18:51.713 --> 18:54.133
We need someone Boro already trusts

18:54.133 --> 18:55.801
to get in his camp immediately.

18:58.762 --> 18:59.847
We need Finn Hoss.

18:59.847 --> 19:01.014
Oh, no way.

19:01.014 --> 19:02.683
Boro doesn't know Finn killed his old man.

19:02.683 --> 19:05.561
He'll welcome the rich European mercenary,

19:05.561 --> 19:06.937
his childhood hero,

19:06.937 --> 19:09.857
the man who looked out for him
with open arms.

19:09.857 --> 19:10.858
I said no.

19:10.858 --> 19:12.025
Whoa, wait.

19:12.025 --> 19:15.195
You'll represent bidders who paid more
for the WMD than anyone else.

19:15.195 --> 19:18.282
You zip in, extract Panda,
grab the WMD, zip on out.

19:18.282 --> 19:21.493
You tell HQ I'm retired.
That's it, and that's all.

19:22.870 --> 19:25.372
This is coming from WH HQ.

19:46.059 --> 19:48.061
<i>Patsy's Pastrami Palace.
How may I help you?</i>

19:48.061 --> 19:50.063
Yeah, I'm confirming a party platter.

19:50.689 --> 19:53.692
Order number XK742.

19:55.986 --> 19:57.905
<i>Yes, sir, that order's confirmed.</i>

19:57.905 --> 20:00.991
<i>It's very hot, and needs to be delivered
as soon as possible.</i>

20:04.286 --> 20:05.162
Damn it.

20:10.125 --> 20:11.043
My ship.

20:13.462 --> 20:14.296
Tally.

20:16.465 --> 20:20.302
Hey pal, uh, I am 100% Team Luke.

20:20.302 --> 20:21.803
Screw Team Donnie.

20:21.803 --> 20:24.681
I promise your ship
will be waiting for you when you get back,

20:24.681 --> 20:27.226
and Operation Life with Wife is a go.

20:27.935 --> 20:29.353
What's Team Donnie?

20:30.145 --> 20:31.897
What? Oh, I didn't say that.

20:33.190 --> 20:35.484
I have a thousand ways to wreck your life,

20:35.484 --> 20:37.402
and you wouldn't even know it was me.

20:39.321 --> 20:43.158
That guy, Donatello, from Tally's office?

20:44.034 --> 20:44.868
They're dating.

20:45.869 --> 20:47.746
I saw them at Color Me Mine
a few months ago,

20:47.746 --> 20:48.997
and I promised I wouldn't tell you.

20:48.997 --> 20:50.082
Judas.

20:50.666 --> 20:52.751
If you were distracted in the field,
you could've gotten hurt.

20:52.751 --> 20:54.795
I was gonna tell you
as soon as your retirement was official,

20:54.795 --> 20:57.547
but then HQ said
they needed to pull you back into Guyana.

20:57.547 --> 20:59.049
Give me the damn file.

21:05.097 --> 21:08.016
Roo and Aldon will be on standby
in case anything goes sideways.

21:08.016 --> 21:10.477
And for what it's worth,
Donnie's snowman mug sucked.

21:12.521 --> 21:13.855
Snowmen ain't purple.

21:27.160 --> 21:29.329
<i>♪ I'm gonna die alone ♪</i>

21:29.329 --> 21:31.123
<i>♪ Really alone ♪</i>

21:31.123 --> 21:33.542
<i>♪ I'm gonna die alone ♪</i>

21:35.210 --> 21:37.045
<i>♪ I'm gonna die alone</i>... <i>♪</i>

21:37.045 --> 21:39.381
That's Cain Khan, Boro's number two.

21:40.299 --> 21:42.092
<i>Be careful, he's tough.</i>

21:42.968 --> 21:44.303
 <i>Doesn't look that tough.</i>

21:44.303 --> 21:46.471
He clearly waxes his eyebrows.
Real men tweeze.

21:46.471 --> 21:47.639
- No messing around.
- I'm not.

21:47.639 --> 21:49.308
B Team's job is to observe and report.

21:49.308 --> 21:51.935
I am observing
a physical characteristic of a target.

21:51.935 --> 21:54.896
And I'm reporting he looks fabulous.

21:54.896 --> 21:56.565
Like a Latino Zac Efron.

21:56.565 --> 21:58.317
You can do Euclidean geometry,

21:58.317 --> 22:00.902
but you can't figure out
it's not time to poke the bear.

22:00.902 --> 22:03.530
- Do you consider yourself the bear?
- Maybe like a baby bear.

22:03.530 --> 22:05.532
Swear to God, lock it up.

22:06.241 --> 22:08.035
That's it, and that's all.

22:08.618 --> 22:11.747
Finn Hoss,
I am Cain, Boro's first lieutenant.

22:12.372 --> 22:14.207
- He awaits your arrival.
- Wonderful.

22:15.208 --> 22:16.460
I didn't say you can go.

22:30.557 --> 22:31.850
Boro knows you.

22:31.850 --> 22:32.934
I do not.

22:34.644 --> 22:35.604
<i>Vámonos</i>.

23:14.059 --> 23:17.145
Oh, am I dreaming? I can't believe it.

23:17.145 --> 23:18.480
- Boro.

23:20.774 --> 23:22.484
I always wondered if I'd see you again.

23:22.484 --> 23:24.736
Look at you, still a brick shithouse.

23:24.736 --> 23:26.571
I still do the workouts you taught me.

23:26.571 --> 23:29.324
Preachers, hammers,
curls for the girls, right?

23:29.324 --> 23:31.493
Look at you, Der Bengal.

23:32.077 --> 23:34.413
Der Bengal,
that's what he used to call me.

23:34.413 --> 23:36.373
- The rascal.
- That's right.

23:36.373 --> 23:39.459
Well, the rascal's done well for himself.

23:39.459 --> 23:40.585
Well, thanks to you.

23:41.545 --> 23:43.630
Everything fell apart after Papa died.

23:44.798 --> 23:46.049
But you always watched over me.

23:46.049 --> 23:48.260
You think I don't know
who was paying for my school?

23:48.260 --> 23:50.804
All the care packages to England,
the peanut brittle?

23:50.804 --> 23:53.765
Return addresses are dangerous
in my line of work, as you know.

23:53.765 --> 23:55.934
I always knew you'd be there for me
if I needed you.

23:56.518 --> 23:57.352
Come here.

23:57.936 --> 24:00.730
You look so much like your father.

24:01.857 --> 24:03.024
I really miss him.

24:05.569 --> 24:07.279
I honor him by continuing his work

24:07.279 --> 24:10.991
and hopefully doing business
with his dear friend, no?

24:10.991 --> 24:11.950
Absolutely.

24:12.534 --> 24:14.327
- When can I see the package?
- Yes.

24:14.327 --> 24:17.831
I have a client who likes to avoid
all this auction nonsense

24:17.831 --> 24:19.166
who'll blow you away with a big offer.

24:19.166 --> 24:20.375
Of course.

24:21.376 --> 24:24.588
But first, a tour of what I've built.

24:28.175 --> 24:30.010
Quite an operation here.

24:30.010 --> 24:32.637
I provide food, shelter, income,

24:33.638 --> 24:36.600
and in return, my soldiers provide me
with unconditional loyalty.

24:37.184 --> 24:39.436
We grow cinnamon, ginger, cacao,

24:39.436 --> 24:43.315
the sale of which helps to launder
our extracurricular activities.

24:45.734 --> 24:46.860
Me <i>no habla</i>.

24:47.736 --> 24:49.571
Translate that Español, Mr. Linguistics.

24:49.571 --> 24:51.072
It's not Spanish, it's Quechua.

24:51.072 --> 24:52.199
What did he say?

24:52.199 --> 24:54.743
He asked his pal if he wanted
to go shooting with him later.

24:54.743 --> 24:58.872
Hell, I wanna go shooting with him.
Our own soldiers don't have that gear yet.

24:59.956 --> 25:03.376
Just thinking about firing
one of those off gives me a gusher.

25:03.376 --> 25:04.753
I also spy with my Goldeneye

25:04.753 --> 25:07.797
tattoos indicating
Ecuadorian Special Forces.

25:07.797 --> 25:09.466
Means even the farm hands are dangerous.

25:09.466 --> 25:10.842
Download me later, okay?

25:10.842 --> 25:12.761
Things are about to get real intense

25:13.803 --> 25:14.846
real soon.

25:16.264 --> 25:17.891
Grossed low eight figures last year.

25:17.891 --> 25:21.061
The bombs in the Manila airport, us.

25:21.645 --> 25:25.273
The AK's in Ethiopia,
on both sides, was us.

25:25.273 --> 25:26.900
Impressed is not the word.

25:26.900 --> 25:28.193
When I sell my weapon,

25:29.236 --> 25:32.322
the most dangerous and most easily
concealed weapon on Earth,

25:33.156 --> 25:34.950
the world will know
I'm a man to be reckoned with.

25:34.950 --> 25:38.453
Russia, China, America,
they will all have to address me.

25:38.453 --> 25:40.914
They will call me Boro Polonia. Polonia.

25:42.290 --> 25:44.209
The name of my father
will be in the mouths

25:44.209 --> 25:45.961
of the world's most powerful men.

25:47.796 --> 25:49.756
Then it will be like he is still alive.

25:57.514 --> 25:58.348
Come.

25:58.848 --> 26:00.433
The boys are blowing off steam.

26:07.774 --> 26:09.484
Dani, come on!

26:09.484 --> 26:10.569
Make a move!

26:10.569 --> 26:13.154
Good, Dani's fighting.

26:16.074 --> 26:19.077
Wow. Packs a big punch for a little guy.

26:19.077 --> 26:20.370
Just remember,

26:21.162 --> 26:22.247
<i>I love you, buddy.</i>

26:22.247 --> 26:24.416
Dani is not a guy.

26:35.969 --> 26:37.220
Holy shit.

26:37.971 --> 26:40.640
Holy shit.

Dani...

27:41.576 --> 27:42.994
someone I'd like you to meet.

27:45.246 --> 27:47.248
Finn Hoss, Danielle DeRosa,

27:47.248 --> 27:48.625
a real life American soldier

27:48.625 --> 27:51.961
that decided if she was gonna fight
for a living, she might as well get rich.

27:56.508 --> 27:57.717
Nice to meet you.

27:59.844 --> 28:01.429
I liked your shoulder trick.

28:01.429 --> 28:03.431
Yeah,
I've been working on it for six months.

28:03.431 --> 28:04.349
Careful.

28:04.849 --> 28:07.227
I know someone
that hurt their shoulder rollerskating.

28:07.727 --> 28:08.603
Never got better.

28:09.229 --> 28:11.231
Dani, she's the toughest one
on the compound.

28:12.774 --> 28:13.692
And Finn here,

28:14.776 --> 28:17.070
this is the baddest man
my father ever knew.

28:17.570 --> 28:20.031
I'm always envious
about the way you talk about your dad.

28:21.116 --> 28:22.784
Probably 'cause mine was a filthy liar.

28:25.787 --> 28:27.831
<i>General council meeting in the pavilion.</i>

28:27.831 --> 28:29.916
- Duty calls.
- Of course.

28:29.916 --> 28:31.835
Dani, can you finish showing Finn around?

28:32.627 --> 28:34.921
Tonight, we celebrate your arrival.

28:35.714 --> 28:37.424
- Tomorrow, we talk shop, eh?
- Yeah.

28:39.467 --> 28:40.510
Come with me.

28:44.180 --> 28:46.683
You better be here to sell Boro a Bowflex.

28:46.683 --> 28:48.977
- Me? Where's the irrigation system?

28:48.977 --> 28:50.603
Oh, and this is Colombia?

28:51.479 --> 28:55.316
Barry, answer the goddamn phone.
I know you're hearing us over the comms.

29:00.071 --> 29:04.617
You knew Luke Brunner's daughter
was a spook, and you didn't tell him?

29:05.702 --> 29:07.078
You know that YouTube video

29:07.078 --> 29:09.831
where a gorilla
goes to town on a cantaloupe?

29:10.457 --> 29:11.499
You're the cantaloupe.

29:11.499 --> 29:13.084
Why didn't you tell him she was Panda?

29:13.084 --> 29:15.420
I couldn't have Luke walking in there
with his kid on his mind.

29:15.420 --> 29:17.130
Any loss of focus could've got him killed.

29:17.130 --> 29:19.174
Pretty sure he's unfocused now.

29:23.553 --> 29:25.138
<i>My daughter's in the CIA?</i>

29:25.138 --> 29:26.598
Hey, buddy.

29:26.598 --> 29:27.807
<i>Uncle Barry?</i>

29:27.807 --> 29:29.184
<i>Hi, pumpkin.</i>

29:29.184 --> 29:30.393
What the fuck?!

29:30.393 --> 29:33.646
Hey, watch your language.
Lower your voice.

29:34.355 --> 29:37.108
First, we are a quarter mile
from the compound.

29:37.609 --> 29:42.781
Second,
fuckity, fuck, fuck, asshole, fuck!

29:42.781 --> 29:45.074
- I think she's upset.
<i>-</i> Dollar in the swear jar.

29:45.074 --> 29:47.035
Everyone, please, let me talk.

29:47.035 --> 29:49.496
Luke, when Emma
got into George Washington,

29:49.496 --> 29:51.748
she was living so close
to CIA headquarters.

29:51.748 --> 29:53.500
It was too tempting for The Farm.

29:54.042 --> 29:55.460
HQ watched the kid grow up.

29:55.460 --> 29:59.047
<i>Physical like you, smart like you,
so they set up a recruitment sting.</i>

29:59.047 --> 30:01.591
<i>$200 for student testing
in the psych department,</i>

30:01.591 --> 30:02.842
<i>and she took the bait.</i>

30:02.842 --> 30:04.844
Highest score CIA's ever seen.

30:04.844 --> 30:07.055
<i>Higher than yours, higher than mine,</i>

30:07.055 --> 30:09.349
except she doesn't have a heart condition.

30:09.349 --> 30:10.850
<i>You put my daughter in danger</i>

30:10.850 --> 30:13.353
<i>because you couldn't handle the fact
that you couldn't do the job?</i>

30:13.353 --> 30:18.149
Her recall, problem-solving skills,
straight-up IQ, off the charts.

30:18.149 --> 30:19.734
<i>She was born to do this.</i>

30:19.734 --> 30:21.277
She's Luke Brunner's kid.

30:21.277 --> 30:24.113
<i>She took the job without hesitation
right after college.</i>

30:24.113 --> 30:27.325
<i>Three years, CMO vault kept it
where you'd never cross paths.</i>

30:27.325 --> 30:28.910
<i>Four years now in the field.</i>

30:28.910 --> 30:31.079
Global Relief Fund is her Merry Fitness.

30:32.956 --> 30:35.291
You guys are CIA officers?

30:36.876 --> 30:39.254
<i>Yeah, for the last 40 years.</i>

30:39.254 --> 30:41.005
<i>Uncle Barry for 17 years.</i>

30:41.005 --> 30:42.340
Uncle Barry? What--

30:42.340 --> 30:44.592
- Explain that to us.
-  Yeah, you're really young.

30:44.592 --> 30:47.011
Started working with Luke when I was 21,
she was 11.

30:47.011 --> 30:48.805
It stuck. And Black don't crack.

30:48.805 --> 30:50.348
<i>Okay, how is this even doable?</i>

30:50.348 --> 30:52.308
The CIA created a Chinese wall

30:52.308 --> 30:55.562
so you'd never know
I or your dad worked for the company.

30:55.562 --> 30:59.440
Set it up where we'd never cross paths,
which was near impossible

30:59.440 --> 31:02.402
considering you both work
for the same regional office.

31:02.402 --> 31:05.488
<i>Only a small number of people know
that both of you are on the job.</i>

31:05.488 --> 31:07.031
<i>For the record, we did not know.</i>

31:07.031 --> 31:08.700
What is he doing here?

31:08.700 --> 31:10.118
You've been compromised.

31:10.118 --> 31:12.662
Troy's gonna burn you
as soon as he lands at 4:00 a.m.

31:13.162 --> 31:16.124
Your dad is there to extract you
and to retrieve the WMD.

31:16.124 --> 31:17.041
<i>What?</i>

31:17.792 --> 31:20.628
<i>I have been working this case,
sweating my ass off...</i>

31:20.628 --> 31:21.546
<i>Language.</i>

31:21.546 --> 31:24.215
<i>...and he's gonna-- Gonna extract me?</i>

31:24.215 --> 31:26.134
The hell are you so mad about?

31:26.885 --> 31:28.219
I should be mad at you.

31:28.219 --> 31:30.597
You've been lying to me
for the last decade.

31:30.597 --> 31:33.266
And you smoke.

31:33.266 --> 31:34.851
A decade?

31:35.602 --> 31:38.771
- You've been lying to me my whole life.

31:39.272 --> 31:40.773
That's it, and that's all.

31:47.113 --> 31:49.198
She just "that's it, and that's all'd" me.

31:52.368 --> 31:54.329
Who the hell was that out there?

31:54.329 --> 31:57.540
"How does my ass taste?"
I mean, who the hell talks like that?

31:57.540 --> 32:00.418
Luke, Emma often does what she wants

32:00.418 --> 32:02.337
<i>when she wants, how she wants,</i>

32:02.337 --> 32:03.963
and doesn't always listen when she should.

32:03.963 --> 32:06.132
'Cause she clearly has daddy issues.

32:06.716 --> 32:09.469
How could you pull my daughter
into this world?

32:09.469 --> 32:11.137
<i>The brass was infatuated with her,</i>

32:11.137 --> 32:14.307
and they threatened me with felony treason
if I leaked her identity to anyone,

32:14.307 --> 32:15.308
including you.

32:15.308 --> 32:17.644
<i>My ulcers and intestinal issues?</i>

32:17.644 --> 32:18.937
This is why.

32:18.937 --> 32:21.856
Your intestinal issues is because
you eat all the Sour Patch crap.

32:21.856 --> 32:25.401
Hey, bottom line, the guy who's gonna
expose Emma lands at 4:00 a.m.

32:25.401 --> 32:26.611
He needs to be dealt with.

32:26.611 --> 32:29.906
But first, I have to go to the party
that Boro's throwing for me.

32:30.573 --> 32:31.699
We'll talk later.

32:35.036 --> 32:36.871
I thought you were my friend, Barry.

32:38.039 --> 32:40.083
-  He's emotional.

32:40.750 --> 32:41.751
He didn't mean that.

32:42.335 --> 32:43.169
Yeah.

32:43.169 --> 32:46.422
Listen, Boro is throwing the party
for everyone, not just Luke.

32:46.422 --> 32:47.340
Yeah.

32:47.340 --> 32:50.051
He totally meant that part
about not being friends though.

32:50.051 --> 32:51.844
- That sucks.
- That does suck.

33:32.635 --> 33:34.637
It is a night to celebrate, no?

33:35.888 --> 33:37.640
Because my father's dear friend,

33:38.266 --> 33:40.518
a man who was like a second dad to me--

33:40.518 --> 33:44.272
I mean, he taught me to drive on this
very compound when I was just a boy.

33:44.856 --> 33:47.775
An ally to Lape Pa Lanmo
when we were first growing

33:48.359 --> 33:49.444
and an ally today.

33:50.319 --> 33:53.406
Everyone, Finn Hoss.

34:03.833 --> 34:06.627
When my father needed resources
to grow our flock,

34:07.837 --> 34:08.838
Finn was there to help.

34:10.173 --> 34:11.132
Out of love...

34:12.341 --> 34:13.342
out of loyalty.

34:13.843 --> 34:16.596
And, while on the subject of loyalty,

34:16.596 --> 34:19.891
I want to single out
one of our longest serving soldiers,

34:21.726 --> 34:22.685
Jacomo Negrino.

34:23.394 --> 34:24.771
Get up here, Jaco, come on.

34:27.523 --> 34:28.691
Yeah.

34:29.776 --> 34:30.693
Yes, there he is.

34:33.988 --> 34:38.618
Jacomo has been part of our family
for over 15 years.

34:40.661 --> 34:43.706
Moving product,
helping expand our territory,

34:45.374 --> 34:46.709
watching every penny.

34:48.169 --> 34:50.338
So the only question I have is...

34:52.548 --> 34:53.508
where's the money?

35:02.892 --> 35:03.768
I don't understand.

35:06.354 --> 35:07.688
Where's my money, Jaco?

35:08.856 --> 35:10.149
This is not good.

35:11.734 --> 35:12.985
You manage it all.

35:13.569 --> 35:15.238
Where's the money from the last sale?
It's gone.

35:15.822 --> 35:18.491
I never touched it.
I would never steal from you.

35:18.491 --> 35:19.450
Boro, no!

35:35.258 --> 35:38.928
This is what happens...
when you betray our family.

35:43.391 --> 35:44.225
Music.

35:48.521 --> 35:49.981
Come on, music.

36:03.953 --> 36:05.830
<i>♪ Trying to please me ♪</i>

36:08.791 --> 36:09.625
<i>♪ You never-- ♪</i>

36:09.625 --> 36:13.129
Christ, Barry,
Boro makes Jim Jones like Jim Henson.

36:13.129 --> 36:15.089
His profile did indicate
some irrationality.

36:15.089 --> 36:17.884
He just opened up a man's head
after a Kool & the Gang song.

36:17.884 --> 36:20.761
- His profile indicated that?
- No, that was a surprise.

36:20.761 --> 36:23.347
So we're dealing with a high IQ
paranoid megalomaniac,

36:23.347 --> 36:24.807
which is a bad combination

36:24.807 --> 36:26.893
when we have two undercovers
we're trying to hide.

36:26.893 --> 36:28.978
- You gotta put us in.
- There are risks to rushing in.

36:28.978 --> 36:31.272
There are risks to playing
Little Miss Muffet too.

36:31.272 --> 36:32.565
Just let me think.

36:34.150 --> 36:36.068
I'm not gonna let anything happen
to the Brunners.

36:36.068 --> 36:37.320
And how are you so certain?

36:37.904 --> 36:41.282
Because family means no one
gets left behind or forgotten.

36:42.742 --> 36:44.327
That's from <i>Lilo & Stitch</i>.

36:44.911 --> 36:45.912
Kiss my ass.

36:45.912 --> 36:47.288
Now, that's from <i>Frozen</i>.

36:51.375 --> 36:53.711
Taking an interest in Miss DeRosa, I see.

36:53.711 --> 36:56.172
Oh no. I'm an old man.

36:56.172 --> 36:57.548
Oh, you're Finn Hoss.

36:57.548 --> 36:59.675
My father said you invented a way

36:59.675 --> 37:02.720
to slit a man's throat vertically
so he bleeds out faster.

37:03.888 --> 37:06.557
You can do that, a girl's no challenge.

37:06.557 --> 37:08.768
Your father also tell you
how much money I made for him?

37:08.768 --> 37:10.436
I can do the same for you.

37:10.937 --> 37:13.814
Just show me that suitcase
everyone in Europe is talking about.

37:14.398 --> 37:18.069
Never get so busy making a living
you forget to make a life.

37:18.653 --> 37:19.820
You taught me that.

37:20.404 --> 37:21.322
Tomorrow, we work.

37:22.323 --> 37:24.617
Tonight, go to Dani.

37:26.535 --> 37:27.495

38:25.761 --> 38:29.223
He knows... that Finn Hoss
is a gun for hire.

38:29.724 --> 38:32.601
He offered me money
to get his family and him out of here.

38:33.436 --> 38:35.062
- He's terrified of this place.
- No.

38:36.063 --> 38:38.065
- What do you mean, just "no"?
- No.

38:38.065 --> 38:40.401
He's been here longer than almost anybody.

38:40.401 --> 38:42.111
His kid was raised here.

38:42.111 --> 38:43.404
It could be a trap.

38:43.404 --> 38:45.948
He also could be a dad
that is scared for his family.

38:45.948 --> 38:48.617
I'm sorry
if I don't have much faith

38:48.617 --> 38:50.328
in the family concept right now.

38:50.328 --> 38:53.831
No. You think it was easy to do
what I was doing with a family?

38:54.665 --> 38:56.751
Trying to keep the marriage together?

38:56.751 --> 38:59.754
You will find out for yourself...
the hard way.

39:02.256 --> 39:04.050
We don't have time for this.

39:04.759 --> 39:07.219
Troy lands in seven hours,
and then I'm dead.

39:07.219 --> 39:09.263
We have to cover miles
through the woods tonight.

39:09.263 --> 39:12.767
If we leave by 2:00 a.m.,
that gives us enough time

39:12.767 --> 39:14.727
and lessens odds of us being seen.

39:15.311 --> 39:17.229
Remember, I'm the senior officer here.

39:19.190 --> 39:21.942
You got me word I'm compromised.
Your job is done.

39:21.942 --> 39:23.736
I know the play for handling Troy.

39:23.736 --> 39:25.279
I know where the WMD is stored,

39:25.279 --> 39:27.615
so follow me or get out of my way.

39:27.615 --> 39:30.201
<i>♪ ...promise from my heart ♪</i>

39:33.537 --> 39:38.250
<i>♪ I couldn't love you any better ♪</i>

39:56.977 --> 39:58.687
I think a farmer must've hit it.

39:59.271 --> 40:01.440
You grab the horns,
and I'll grab the legs.

40:22.169 --> 40:24.505
You could have just hid in the bushes.

40:26.298 --> 40:28.467
I didn't know
who was gonna make the pickup.

40:28.467 --> 40:31.262
Could have weighed
150 pounds more than me.

40:32.221 --> 40:34.390
Element of surprise, this was the move.

40:34.390 --> 40:36.225
Here, clean up and change.

40:37.017 --> 40:38.853
We gotta load up the bodies
and move the cow.

40:38.853 --> 40:40.688
Oh really? I thought we'd leave them here.

40:40.688 --> 40:41.897
What?

40:42.857 --> 40:43.691
Nothing.

40:45.401 --> 40:48.279
<i>During your little scuffle,
comms fell off and your camera broke.</i>

40:48.279 --> 40:51.073
<i>I'm not comfortable
with you doing the rest of this blind.</i>

40:51.073 --> 40:54.285
It's not like I can run around
the compound with a cell phone in my hand.

40:54.285 --> 40:56.328
I'll touch base with you later, okay?

40:57.121 --> 40:57.955
Easy.

40:57.955 --> 41:00.332
- I should have driven.
- Oh really?

41:00.332 --> 41:02.751
Do we have to talk about
Mrs. Bernstein's cockapoo?

41:04.295 --> 41:05.629
Maybe I wouldn't have hit Rosco

41:05.629 --> 41:09.258
if you'd squeezed some driving lessons
for me in between all of Boro's.

41:09.258 --> 41:12.386
I killed the kid's father,
so I felt guilty.

41:12.386 --> 41:13.929
You killed Boro's dad?

41:14.513 --> 41:16.640
Shit, how many kids have you screwed up?

41:19.310 --> 41:20.519
Troy's back.

41:20.519 --> 41:22.813
Go faster.
It's a bad idea to keep him waiting.

41:22.813 --> 41:24.356
Well, talking about bad ideas,

41:24.356 --> 41:26.817
what were you thinking sleeping with Boro?

41:26.817 --> 41:29.653
What? I didn't sleep with that creep.

41:29.653 --> 41:30.571
Good.

41:31.155 --> 41:33.407
Now, you know I'm not too fond of Carter,

41:34.158 --> 41:35.659
but if you're really getting serious,

41:36.911 --> 41:40.706
you should enter marriage... before you...

41:41.207 --> 41:42.124
What?

41:42.750 --> 41:43.584
Nothing.

41:44.168 --> 41:47.087
- Do you think I'm a virgin?
- Let me think what I want to think.

41:47.087 --> 41:48.380
Oh my God, I'm 28.

41:48.380 --> 41:51.425
All right, I'm old-fashioned.
When I got married, it felt special

41:51.425 --> 41:53.427
that I was the only man
your mother's been with.

41:53.427 --> 41:56.514
- Well, not anymore.
- What are you talking about?

42:01.143 --> 42:03.062
Been divorced 15 years.
What'd you think would happen?

42:03.062 --> 42:04.855
You're talking about
that schmuck Donatello?

42:04.855 --> 42:05.856
Yep.

42:05.856 --> 42:08.484
You're my daughter.
You're supposed to tell me those things.

42:08.484 --> 42:09.401
Tell you what?

42:09.401 --> 42:12.655
There was an Italian guy from accounting
giving Mom the old "sausich"?

42:12.655 --> 42:14.323
That son of a bitch.

42:15.616 --> 42:17.243
What does she see in that loser?

42:17.243 --> 42:19.411
Maybe the fact that he's actually around.

42:21.956 --> 42:23.707
Well, you know why I haven't been around.

42:26.460 --> 42:28.963
Why do all the women in my life
have terrible taste in men?

42:28.963 --> 42:30.381
Carter is sweet.

42:30.381 --> 42:32.383
He's kind and gentle...

42:34.843 --> 42:36.011
...and reliable.

42:36.011 --> 42:36.971
And so is Donnie.

42:36.971 --> 42:39.515
Gee, wonder why Mom and I
are attracted to guys like that now.

42:41.767 --> 42:44.186
- Okay, now what?
- Suck it up.

42:44.186 --> 42:45.354
Mom likes the guy.

42:45.354 --> 42:46.939
No, I'm talking about the bodies.

42:47.648 --> 42:49.733
You want to run the show?
Then run the damn show.

42:49.733 --> 42:52.945
Fine. We throw 'em in the back
and ditch 'em in the rice paddies.

42:52.945 --> 42:55.030
It's off-season.
No one goes there this time of year.

42:56.699 --> 42:58.993
Double-time. Rain'll slow us.

42:58.993 --> 43:00.035
Hey.

43:00.035 --> 43:01.495
I'm sorry I cursed.

43:02.079 --> 43:04.331
Dad, I don't give a shit.

43:12.381 --> 43:17.052
Nuke's kept here in the north acreage,
away from the rest of the compound.

43:17.052 --> 43:20.055
Best way there is through this stretch.
No one will see us.

43:20.055 --> 43:22.349
- Set up?
- Steel construction Quonset hut.

43:22.349 --> 43:27.354
Four guards, one at each compass point,
rotate every five hours.

43:27.354 --> 43:29.231
All have AKs and MP7s.

43:29.231 --> 43:30.983
But I've got one too,

43:31.483 --> 43:34.111
and they can't shoot like I can.

43:35.613 --> 43:37.156
They don't know I have this.

43:37.156 --> 43:38.407
Where did you get that?

43:39.366 --> 43:40.659
Black market in town.

43:40.659 --> 43:43.245
I started skimming cash
as soon as they assigned me admin detail.

43:43.829 --> 43:45.956
So Jacomo got killed
because you were stealing?

43:47.207 --> 43:48.042
Apparently.

43:49.460 --> 43:52.338
What? Jacomo was helping Boro
sell illegal weapons.

43:56.050 --> 43:58.427
- What's that?
- The Charter Arms Pink Lady.

43:58.427 --> 44:01.513
Small, easiest thing I could smuggle in
when I first got here.

44:03.724 --> 44:05.392
Well, I think I should have the automatic.

44:05.392 --> 44:07.311
I set the marksmanship score for my class.

44:07.311 --> 44:10.773
So did I. And who knows even
if you're gonna be sober?

44:10.773 --> 44:12.858
I mean, is this how I raised you?

44:12.858 --> 44:14.026
Alcohol?

44:14.902 --> 44:15.736
Cigarettes?

44:15.736 --> 44:18.280
- And a garish lipstick--
- That's not lipstick.

44:18.280 --> 44:19.948
- Oh my God.

44:19.948 --> 44:22.701
-  It's vibrating. My God.
- Kill me now.

44:22.701 --> 44:23.619
Purell!

44:23.619 --> 44:25.371
Stop touching my things. Oh my God.

44:25.371 --> 44:26.872
Tidy up before your dad comes to visit.

44:26.872 --> 44:29.166
I didn't know
you were gonna be here, remember?

44:29.833 --> 44:31.877
Transport is gonna be
at the airstrip in 30.

44:31.877 --> 44:33.712
Can we please just focus on the job?

44:33.712 --> 44:34.630
Yes, please.

44:34.630 --> 44:36.006
Good because we gotta get--

44:36.799 --> 44:38.217
- My God.
- Oh my God.

44:38.217 --> 44:39.551
It's still buzzing.

44:39.551 --> 44:41.303
- Oh God.
- Jesus. Okay.

44:41.303 --> 44:42.680
Okay. Okay.

44:43.263 --> 44:45.015
It's off. It's off, okay? It's off.

44:46.225 --> 44:47.893
God, why are you here?

44:55.859 --> 44:58.112
I never knew you hated me that much.

45:02.866 --> 45:04.284
I don't hate you,

45:04.868 --> 45:07.204
but I have every right to be furious

45:07.204 --> 45:09.957
now that I know that
what I suspected all along was right.

45:09.957 --> 45:11.875
You suspected I was an operative?

45:11.875 --> 45:15.671
No, that it was 100% your fault
you and Mom got divorced.

45:15.671 --> 45:18.132
But, <i>Schatzel</i>, now you know
why I was gone so much.

45:18.132 --> 45:21.927
I tried to convince myself, you know,
"Dad has to travel for work."

45:21.927 --> 45:23.679
"He's a small businessman."

45:23.679 --> 45:27.099
"Clearly a very bad small businessman,
but, you know...

45:29.309 --> 45:30.728
he's doing his best."

45:33.439 --> 45:35.524
I wanted to beg you to sell that company,

45:36.483 --> 45:37.609
to stay home.

45:39.695 --> 45:43.365
But, you know, family situation
was tense enough with Mom always so sad.

45:44.616 --> 45:45.659
She was sad?

45:47.286 --> 45:50.205
- I thought she was angry.
- You could have taken a desk job.

45:50.205 --> 45:52.291
Analytics, logistics, training.

45:53.542 --> 45:56.336
You could've been home.
But no, you didn't want a desk job,

45:56.336 --> 45:59.548
you wanted to run around the world
doing cool, sexy cases.

45:59.548 --> 46:01.925
- That's not true.
- Yes, it is. You know how I know?

46:01.925 --> 46:04.136
Because I like doing cool, sexy cases.

46:04.136 --> 46:05.804
Difference is, I don't have a family.

46:07.014 --> 46:09.975
I did everything I could
to make you wanna stay with us.

46:09.975 --> 46:12.144
Sports, violin...

46:12.644 --> 46:14.438
...math competitions.

46:14.438 --> 46:17.858
But you loved all of those things,
and you were so good at it.

46:17.858 --> 46:19.902
I wasn't good. I was perfect.

46:19.902 --> 46:21.779
I thought if I could do everything right,

46:21.779 --> 46:24.323
then no matter what
was going on with you and Mom...

46:25.824 --> 46:27.534
How could you leave a perfect kid?

46:31.163 --> 46:34.708
And now I'm an adult
still pretending to be perfect

46:34.708 --> 46:38.295
because... I just got so goddamn used to it.

46:38.295 --> 46:40.172
But you know what? That's-- It's great.

46:40.172 --> 46:41.590
I'm so glad you know about my job

46:41.590 --> 46:44.134
because now I can maybe
stop faking it in front of you.

46:45.469 --> 46:47.721
- Sweetheart--
- No. We gotta get the suitcase ASAP.

46:47.721 --> 46:50.140
Boro is gonna wake up,
he's gonna wonder where Troy is,

46:50.140 --> 46:52.434
and it's not gonna take him
a long time to do the math.

46:52.434 --> 46:54.311
Finn Hoss, get out here!

46:55.604 --> 46:59.191
- What do you think that means?
- It means Boro's math homework's done.

47:04.780 --> 47:05.948
Where were you last night?

47:05.948 --> 47:09.451
Troy had an offer for our weapon
for millions, and now he's gone missing.

47:09.451 --> 47:10.786
Who the hell is Troy?

47:10.786 --> 47:12.079
I am a card player.

47:12.079 --> 47:13.455
If we've never had a cheat in the game,

47:13.455 --> 47:16.792
and money starts to go missing
when the new man sits at the table,

47:16.792 --> 47:17.960
who do you think we suspect?

47:17.960 --> 47:20.295
Usually,
the one who's doing all the talking.

47:20.796 --> 47:22.172
Right now, you won't shut up.

47:22.172 --> 47:23.966
I saw you exit the woods together.

47:25.300 --> 47:27.052
I took your advice about Dani.

47:27.553 --> 47:29.304
She is a tomcat.

47:29.304 --> 47:31.223
That's why we were in the woods.

47:42.401 --> 47:45.571
Maybe no one goes down
to the rice paddies this time of the year

47:45.571 --> 47:46.905
because of all the flooding.

47:49.157 --> 47:50.242
Sounds about right.

47:50.826 --> 47:51.952
Move!

47:51.952 --> 47:53.120
Move. Out of the way.

48:01.837 --> 48:04.673
The cut on Marcos' neck,

48:05.465 --> 48:06.550
is it vertical?

48:08.510 --> 48:09.845
Finn!

48:10.637 --> 48:13.098
Barry, we need an evac
at the airstrip now.

48:13.098 --> 48:14.892
Go! Find them!

48:14.892 --> 48:16.894
They do not leave this compound!

48:17.394 --> 48:19.730
You find him, and you bring him to me. Go!

48:19.730 --> 48:21.773
They do not leave this compound!

48:34.786 --> 48:37.873
No. I slipped a note under his door
before we went after Troy.

48:41.460 --> 48:44.004
- What if he's a loyalist to Boro?
- He would've shot us already.

48:44.004 --> 48:45.422
They're not coming with us.

48:45.422 --> 48:46.590
We're not with Boro.

48:47.507 --> 48:49.426
They're getting close.
We've got to do this now.

48:49.426 --> 48:52.137
I am so done doing things
just to please you.

48:54.348 --> 48:55.432
I don't have my gun.

48:55.933 --> 48:57.684
- I have to go hand-to-hand.
- No.

49:00.687 --> 49:03.315
Barry, within 50 yards of our location,

49:03.315 --> 49:05.192
there are probably
seven to eight cell phones.

49:05.192 --> 49:08.278
The one with the weakest signal
will be wired to the nuke

49:08.278 --> 49:10.155
and sheltered under a steel roof.

49:10.155 --> 49:12.366
Fake an accelerated countdown sequence.

49:12.366 --> 49:13.617
<i>On it.</i>

49:13.617 --> 49:14.701
What are you doing?

49:15.285 --> 49:16.370
Top of a hill,

49:16.370 --> 49:20.082
there are two bulls that are looking down
at a bunch of beautiful cows.

49:20.666 --> 49:21.833
The younger says to the older,

49:21.833 --> 49:24.795
"Why don't we just run down
and make love to one of them?"

49:25.295 --> 49:26.463
And the older one says,

49:27.339 --> 49:30.008
"Why don't we just walk down
and make love to all of them?"

49:30.759 --> 49:31.885
Know what it is about?

49:31.885 --> 49:34.012
It's about not rushing into things.

49:34.638 --> 49:36.264
Sounds like it's about cow rape.

50:08.588 --> 50:09.506
Let's go.

50:24.312 --> 50:26.773
- They're on us. Keep down.

50:30.318 --> 50:32.904
- Emma.
- I'm okay. Just take him out.

50:35.532 --> 50:37.409
We're bouncing all over the place.
I can't get a shot off.

50:37.409 --> 50:38.910
They were able to hit me.

50:51.548 --> 50:52.632
Shit.

51:03.769 --> 51:08.106
That. Was. Her. Violin. Arm.
