00:48.213 --> 00:51.759
Yes, well, the first time
I ever heard that name...

00:51.925 --> 00:54.511
Clouseau was just
a little nobody.

00:54.720 --> 00:59.099
A police officer in some little
village far outside of Paris.

00:59.600 --> 01:03.187
He was the village idiot
as far as I could tell.

01:30.381 --> 01:32.341
Idiot, pull up.

01:41.183 --> 01:44.812
Monsieur Dumont, you must move
your vehicle immediately.

01:44.978 --> 01:47.189
I am so sorry, Officer Clouseau.

01:47.940 --> 01:50.109
My chair, it won't move.

01:51.860 --> 01:53.570
Here's your problem.

01:53.737 --> 01:56.699
Your battery cable has come undone.
Let me help.

01:56.865 --> 01:59.952
Let's see. The positive
to the negative.

02:00.119 --> 02:02.746
The negative to the positive.
There.

02:03.372 --> 02:05.958
All right, you are ready to go.

02:11.463 --> 02:14.383
All clear, keep it moving.

02:15.009 --> 02:17.052
As chief inspector of
the Police Nationale...

02:17.219 --> 02:21.390
I hear many stories of our
officers in the field.

02:21.974 --> 02:24.727
Clouseau generated many...

02:25.310 --> 02:26.520
many stories.

02:27.438 --> 02:30.232
You are under arrest for the
murder of Pierre Fuquet.

02:31.859 --> 02:34.486
You are under arrest for the
murder of Pierre Fuquet.

02:36.321 --> 02:38.866
You are under arrest for the
murder of Pierre Fuquet.

02:39.241 --> 02:40.743
Pierre Fuquet?

02:41.952 --> 02:43.996
The case is closed.

02:45.956 --> 02:47.249
Needless to say...

02:47.416 --> 02:52.588
Clouseau did not qualify for
any advancement whatsoever.

02:52.755 --> 02:56.050
I never thought for a moment I
would have any use for him...

02:56.216 --> 02:58.886
until that fateful day.

03:00.095 --> 03:03.974
It was a perfect
day for a murder.

03:04.141 --> 03:08.645
France against China, with the
winner advancing to the finals.

03:09.313 --> 03:13.942
I had been invited, as chief
inspector of the Police Nationale.

03:14.109 --> 03:17.988
And because of my recent
nomination for the Medal of Honor.

03:18.155 --> 03:21.533
I have been nominated
seven times.

03:21.992 --> 03:24.119
I have never won.

03:24.286 --> 03:28.582
But still, seven nominations...

03:28.749 --> 03:30.334
that's something.

03:30.709 --> 03:35.547
Anyway, the coach of the
French team, Yves Gluant...

03:35.714 --> 03:39.176
came out for his
customary ovation.

03:41.553 --> 03:44.723
He raised his fist to the crowd.

03:44.890 --> 03:46.141
On it:

03:46.308 --> 03:48.310
The Pink Panther diamond.

03:53.607 --> 03:58.237
It was quite the symbol of pride
and victory for the French team.

03:59.238 --> 04:01.740
Gluant's girlfriend
at that time...

04:01.907 --> 04:05.703
was Xania, the
international pop star.

04:05.869 --> 04:09.039
They had been having
quite a stormy affair.

04:36.900 --> 04:40.070
By the end of regulation
time the score was tied...

04:40.237 --> 04:44.283
and the game went
into sudden death.

04:44.450 --> 04:47.745
For a patriotic Frenchman and
a true fan like myself...

04:47.911 --> 04:51.749
it was almost too
thrilling to believe.

04:52.458 --> 04:53.959
And then...

04:54.335 --> 04:56.503
the miracle.

05:11.477 --> 05:13.312
Yes! Yeah!

05:13.479 --> 05:16.315
Yes!

05:16.940 --> 05:18.484
Yes!

05:34.917 --> 05:37.294
Yes!

05:41.674 --> 05:46.512
And then, in front of a
stadium filled with people...

05:46.679 --> 05:49.306
Gluant collapsed...

05:49.515 --> 05:50.891
dead.

05:51.850 --> 05:55.688
A poison dart in his neck.

05:55.854 --> 05:59.191
And the Pink Panther diamond...

06:01.026 --> 06:03.779
had disappeared.

09:13.927 --> 09:17.514
The newspapers fed on Gluant's
murder with a frenzy.

09:17.681 --> 09:20.184
For them, the world had stopped.

09:20.351 --> 09:21.560
For me...

09:22.102 --> 09:25.939
it was an opportunity for
my greatest triumph.

09:28.400 --> 09:30.569
I know what we need
for the Gluant case.

09:31.403 --> 09:33.739
- What?
- An incompetent.

09:33.906 --> 09:38.744
An unimaginative, by-the-book,
low-level incompetent...

09:38.911 --> 09:41.997
who will plod along,
getting nowhere...

09:42.164 --> 09:44.750
with the media watching
his every step.

09:44.917 --> 09:47.169
And while he is
getting nowhere...

09:47.336 --> 09:50.422
I will put together the finest
team of investigators in France...

09:50.589 --> 09:53.842
and we will hunt down the killer,
retrieve the Pink Panther diamond...

09:54.009 --> 09:57.262
and then the Medal of
Honor will be mine.

09:57.763 --> 10:00.099
And who is this incompetent?

10:00.474 --> 10:05.312
Oh, I think I know the
perfect man for the job.

10:05.688 --> 10:10.109
Find him and bring him to Paris.

10:10.609 --> 10:14.029
His name is Clouseau.

11:31.648 --> 11:33.067
Good morning, mademoiselle.

11:33.942 --> 11:36.362
I'll be right with you.

11:39.907 --> 11:42.743
The minister of justice sent
around a new picture of himself...

11:42.910 --> 11:45.704
but it was bigger than Chief
Inspector Dreyfus' picture.

11:45.871 --> 11:48.040
So the chief inspector
had a larger one made.

11:48.207 --> 11:51.710
You'll find that Paris can
be a very political place.

11:51.877 --> 11:55.839
Yes, politics. Where greed
wears the mask of morality.

11:56.006 --> 11:58.676
That's good. Did you say that?

12:01.720 --> 12:02.930
Yes, I did.

12:04.556 --> 12:06.684
- Could you help me down?
- Oh, yes, of course.

12:10.562 --> 12:13.691
Oh, yes. Here, just...
Perhaps...

12:13.899 --> 12:15.776
- Yes, I...
- All right.

12:15.943 --> 12:18.153
- Wait.
- Yeah.

12:18.320 --> 12:21.532
Don't jump. Yes, that's good.
All right.

12:21.699 --> 12:24.993
I think if you put your
leg right there...

12:25.160 --> 12:27.871
- Okay.
- Yes. Okay.

12:29.373 --> 12:30.916
Yes.

12:32.543 --> 12:34.920
- I can't see anything.
- Maybe over here?

12:35.087 --> 12:37.172
- Yes, okay.
- Okay.

12:37.339 --> 12:39.383
Over here.

12:44.763 --> 12:46.849
The inspector will see you now.

12:47.599 --> 12:49.893
He'll be right with you.

12:53.439 --> 12:54.773
Clouseau.

12:54.940 --> 12:57.192
- Clouseau.
- He's coming in.

12:58.360 --> 12:59.778
Good.

13:03.949 --> 13:07.119
Officer Jacques Clouseau,
gendarme, third class.

13:17.796 --> 13:22.134
- That had to hurt.
- No. No, not at all. No.

13:22.301 --> 13:24.511
Clouseau, the reason
we called you here...

13:25.304 --> 13:29.266
It is lovely weather
we are having.

13:29.475 --> 13:34.688
I hope the weather continues.

13:41.487 --> 13:43.405
The area is secure.

13:43.572 --> 13:45.199
Oh, thank you.

13:45.366 --> 13:48.494
Clouseau, I have reviewed your
records, and it is clear to me...

13:48.660 --> 13:52.247
that a man of your talent merits
greater responsibility...

13:52.414 --> 13:54.208
than you have had
up to this point.

13:54.375 --> 13:57.670
I have decided to promote
you to inspector...

13:57.836 --> 14:01.340
the highest rank of any
officer in the republic.

14:01.507 --> 14:03.092
- Inspector?
- Exactly.

14:03.258 --> 14:05.969
And your first case is
the Gluant murder...

14:06.136 --> 14:08.555
and theft of the Pink
Panther diamond.

14:08.722 --> 14:10.140
- I am honored.
- Good.

14:10.641 --> 14:13.143
Jacques Clouseau, by the
power vested in me...

14:13.352 --> 14:17.773
I hereby appoint you
full inspector...

14:17.940 --> 14:19.858
with all of the...

14:26.907 --> 14:30.285
Here, if you would
be so kind, please.

14:31.203 --> 14:32.538
Oh, here, take my pen.

14:33.872 --> 14:35.499
Thank you.

14:36.250 --> 14:41.588
One does not often see the
traditional French fountain pen.

14:46.218 --> 14:49.054
I will cherish this forever.

14:49.388 --> 14:51.932
No. It is not a gift.

14:52.099 --> 14:54.977
That was given to me
by the mayor of Paris.

14:55.728 --> 14:57.146
Well, then...

14:57.312 --> 14:58.731
I cannot accept this.

15:01.442 --> 15:02.943
The press conference.

15:03.944 --> 15:06.780
Yes. Clouseau, there is
a press conference...

15:06.947 --> 15:09.908
in just a few minutes
down the hall...

15:10.075 --> 15:11.744
to introduce you to the media.

15:11.910 --> 15:14.204
We'll meet you there.
And, Clouseau?

15:14.371 --> 15:15.789
Yes?

15:16.582 --> 15:17.791
Good luck.

15:18.083 --> 15:20.085
Good luck to you.

15:20.252 --> 15:22.713
And where is the
press conference?

15:23.172 --> 15:24.715
Go under the arch...

15:24.923 --> 15:27.676
through the door on the
right and down the hall.

15:30.637 --> 15:32.097
Well...

15:36.935 --> 15:39.646
The area is still secure.

15:41.065 --> 15:42.733
Thank you.

15:46.070 --> 15:47.738
He's perfect.

15:48.781 --> 15:51.992
Yes, we have definitely
found our man.

15:52.159 --> 15:53.952
Why do I feel wet?

15:54.662 --> 15:56.622
Because of the unique
nature of the crime...

15:56.789 --> 15:59.833
we have brought in a man
specially suited to the case:

16:00.000 --> 16:02.961
Inspector Jacques Clouseau.

16:08.676 --> 16:09.843
Inspector.

16:10.344 --> 16:11.804
Inspector.

16:13.138 --> 16:15.641
- Yes?
- Yes, what's your initial premise?

16:16.392 --> 16:18.352
That Gluant did not
want to be killed.

16:18.519 --> 16:21.730
Everything else follows
like liquid mercury...

16:21.897 --> 16:24.733
flowing down a... A...

16:24.900 --> 16:27.945
A sloping thing.

16:28.153 --> 16:30.781
How long do you think it will
take to find the killer?

16:30.989 --> 16:34.660
Right now the killer is being
surrounded by a web of deduction...

16:34.827 --> 16:37.997
forensic science and the
latest in technology...

16:38.163 --> 16:41.500
such as two-way
radios and e-mail.

16:42.084 --> 16:46.588
Assign a man to be his driver who can
report on his whereabouts at all times.

16:46.755 --> 16:48.757
What kind of man?

16:48.924 --> 16:52.928
A man who follows orders
and doesn't ask questions.

16:53.470 --> 16:56.724
Inspector, do you know if the
killer was a man or a woman?

16:56.890 --> 17:00.686
Well, of course I know that.
What else is there? A kitten?

17:00.853 --> 17:02.771
Excuse me, do you think
it's possible...

17:02.938 --> 17:05.107
that the killer could
be watching you now?

17:05.273 --> 17:07.984
Well, if I was a killer, I
would certainly be watching...

17:08.152 --> 17:10.319
and possibly taping
for later playback...

17:10.529 --> 17:14.575
because, you know, it's a big
deal to be talked about on TV.

17:15.117 --> 17:16.910
But I have a message
for the killer:

17:17.703 --> 17:19.829
There is no place you can hide.

17:20.039 --> 17:22.958
There is no place
you cannot be seen.

17:23.125 --> 17:26.127
Killer, I will find you...

17:26.295 --> 17:28.630
because I am a servant
of the nation.

17:28.797 --> 17:31.175
Because justice is justice...

17:31.342 --> 17:35.471
and because France is France.

17:49.276 --> 17:52.237
- Bonjour, Nicole.
- Good morning, inspector.

17:52.404 --> 17:54.281
Welcome to your new office.

17:54.448 --> 17:57.242
You should probably start by
going through these files.

17:59.370 --> 18:03.624
It is lovely weather
we are having.

18:06.377 --> 18:08.754
I hope the weather...

18:08.921 --> 18:11.382
stays this mild.

18:21.016 --> 18:24.687
If the weather continues...

18:24.853 --> 18:30.693
we are in for a lovely summer.

18:36.031 --> 18:37.491
The area is secure.

18:37.658 --> 18:40.411
- Are you all right?
- Well, of course I'm all right.

18:40.619 --> 18:42.579
And what is that?

18:42.788 --> 18:45.332
- What?
- Nothing.

18:46.125 --> 18:50.629
You should probably start by looking
at these files. You have to...

19:00.639 --> 19:03.100
My leg, it crushed my leg!

19:12.735 --> 19:15.446
Being an inspector, you'll
need some new clothes.

19:15.696 --> 19:18.365
I can take your measurements
and have something sent over.

19:18.532 --> 19:20.242
- Of course.
- Please remove your jacket.

19:20.409 --> 19:21.952
Yes.

19:22.828 --> 19:26.415
- Do you live by yourself, inspector?
- Yes, I do.

19:27.333 --> 19:28.542
Do you get lonely?

19:28.709 --> 19:30.961
No, not really. Not
since the Internet.

19:31.128 --> 19:34.131
Well, that takes care of that.
And welcome to Paris.

19:34.298 --> 19:36.008
Thank you.

19:36.508 --> 19:38.344
Good morning, monsieur.

19:38.552 --> 19:40.262
And you are?

19:40.429 --> 19:42.890
Gilbert Ponton.
Detective, second class.

19:43.057 --> 19:44.767
I've been assigned
to work with you.

19:44.933 --> 19:47.186
What qualifications do you
have for police work?

19:47.353 --> 19:49.980
My family's done police work
in Paris for nine generations.

19:50.189 --> 19:53.692
- And before that?
- We were policemen for 200 years.

19:53.859 --> 19:56.487
- And before that?
- Immigrants from countries in Europe.

19:56.653 --> 19:58.822
- All involved in police work.
- And before that?

19:58.989 --> 20:00.574
Farmers.

20:01.700 --> 20:05.913
So you are a little lamb who has
come to Clouseau for to learn.

20:06.455 --> 20:10.959
Gilbert Ponton, I vow to teach you
everything I know about police work.

20:11.126 --> 20:12.378
And together...

20:12.544 --> 20:15.589
we are going to catch a killer.

20:18.717 --> 20:19.927
There.

20:20.094 --> 20:23.889
The Chinese VIP box, right on
the edge of the kill zone.

20:24.056 --> 20:28.185
The poison was Chinese.
Was Gluant ever in China?

20:28.352 --> 20:30.896
Three years ago, he took a
group of French stars there...

20:31.063 --> 20:32.564
for some exhibition games.

20:33.107 --> 20:35.442
Gluant was in China...

20:35.609 --> 20:37.528
the poison is from China...

20:37.695 --> 20:39.738
the Chinese are from China.

20:40.072 --> 20:45.077
It may be too early to say for certain,
but I think our killer is Chinese.

20:45.244 --> 20:47.579
Corbeille, I want you on the
next flight to Beijing.

20:47.746 --> 20:50.582
Find out what Gluant did there,
who he saw, where he went.

20:51.458 --> 20:54.920
Pacquette, I want a dossier on
every Chinaman in that box.

20:55.087 --> 20:56.422
Go, go, go, go, go.

21:04.013 --> 21:05.848
Inspector, it's
awfully late and...

21:06.265 --> 21:08.851
Oh, I'm just going over
these crime-scene photos.

21:09.018 --> 21:12.479
- Don't you need some rest?
- Crime does not rest, Nicole.

21:12.646 --> 21:13.981
It's true.

21:14.148 --> 21:15.858
You see...

21:16.025 --> 21:18.485
I have waited a long
time to prove myself.

21:19.111 --> 21:21.739
And I've been given the
opportunity of a lifetime.

21:22.156 --> 21:25.576
And I intend to show the
world exactly who I am...

21:25.743 --> 21:29.038
and what I can do.
I must not fail.

21:30.164 --> 21:32.833
You won't. I know it.

21:33.000 --> 21:34.960
Thank you, Nicole.

21:38.464 --> 21:40.424
- Nicole?
- Yes?

21:40.799 --> 21:43.052
May I be very frank with you?

21:43.635 --> 21:44.845
Of course.

21:45.012 --> 21:47.639
You have put on a ton of weight.

21:47.806 --> 21:50.434
Now, what I do when I
get a little heavy...

21:52.811 --> 21:54.521
Never mind.

21:54.980 --> 21:57.316
Would you like me to stay
behind and help you?

21:59.610 --> 22:01.612
That is a generous
offer, Nicole...

22:01.820 --> 22:05.449
but I am quite sensitive
to office gender politics.

22:05.616 --> 22:08.327
And in today's world, the
slightest gesture...

22:08.494 --> 22:11.872
can be misinterpreted
as harassment.

22:12.039 --> 22:16.126
And it is late, and I would
prefer not to put you or me...

22:16.335 --> 22:19.296
into that delicate situation.

22:19.463 --> 22:20.881
Agreed?

22:21.048 --> 22:22.549
Yes, I agree.

22:22.716 --> 22:26.303
Well, let's seal it with a kiss.
And I'll get back to work.

22:28.430 --> 22:29.932
I am going to be frank.

22:30.099 --> 22:32.142
Since you are only a
detective, second class...

22:32.351 --> 22:34.478
your senses may not be
as sharp as my own.

22:34.687 --> 22:37.147
And as I do not want a partner
who makes me duller...

22:37.314 --> 22:40.901
I have come up with a plan to
keep you as sharp as possible.

22:41.068 --> 22:42.736
And what is that?

22:42.903 --> 22:46.615
Intermittently, and without
warning, I will attack you...

22:46.782 --> 22:49.451
whenever and wherever
it is least expected.

22:49.868 --> 22:53.414
In this way, I will keep you
vigilant and alert. Agreed?

22:54.289 --> 22:55.582
Yes.

22:57.459 --> 23:00.087
- Good one.
- Thank you.

23:01.380 --> 23:02.881
Here we are.

23:08.804 --> 23:11.432
"Do not open door when
light is flashing."

23:30.659 --> 23:32.411
Excuse me.

23:32.578 --> 23:34.997
Coming through. Thank you.

23:44.965 --> 23:46.759
And I'm wondering if you... Yes.

23:46.925 --> 23:50.387
I'm wondering if you saw,
perhaps, a person yelling.

23:50.596 --> 23:53.682
Stop! Stop, stop!

23:55.142 --> 23:57.144
Who are you, and what
the hell are you doing?

23:57.603 --> 24:00.522
- I'm in the middle of an interrogation.
- The booth is soundproof.

24:00.689 --> 24:03.233
She can't hear a word. And in
case you haven't noticed...

24:03.442 --> 24:05.778
you ruined my recording session.
Now, get out.

24:05.944 --> 24:08.572
Unless you want to be charged
with obstruction of justice...

24:08.781 --> 24:10.407
you will let me
interrogate Xania.

24:10.616 --> 24:13.369
It's all right, Roland.
Hello, inspector.

24:13.535 --> 24:15.037
I'm Xania.

24:15.371 --> 24:19.208
You do not know this, but I am
intimately familiar with your work.

24:20.125 --> 24:22.127
You are very kind.

24:24.630 --> 24:26.715
Did you say that booth
was soundproof?

24:27.549 --> 24:28.759
Yes.

24:49.238 --> 24:52.700
Now, you were nearby
when Gluant was killed?

24:52.866 --> 24:55.577
Yes, I ran out to be with
him after the team won.

24:55.744 --> 24:56.954
Of course you did.

24:57.871 --> 24:59.456
Now, a few hours
before the murder...

24:59.832 --> 25:03.794
six witnesses saw you repeatedly
striking the deceased and screaming...

25:03.961 --> 25:05.337
What was it, Ponton?

25:05.504 --> 25:08.298
"I am going to kill you.
I am going to kill you."

25:08.465 --> 25:11.885
I was angry. I caught
him with another woman.

25:12.052 --> 25:14.304
And this was after
he said he loved me.

25:14.513 --> 25:16.557
You poor little angel waif.

25:17.558 --> 25:19.810
After he cheated on me...

25:20.394 --> 25:22.312
I hated him.

25:22.730 --> 25:25.024
- But I didn't kill him.
- Of course you didn't.

25:25.190 --> 25:27.818
- You recently performed in China...
- Stop browbeating her!

25:28.027 --> 25:30.487
Can't you see she's sexy?

25:31.864 --> 25:33.615
Three months ago in Shanghai.

25:34.033 --> 25:37.244
Can you think of anyone else
who might have hated Gluant?

25:37.578 --> 25:40.372
- Bizu.
- The football star?

25:40.831 --> 25:44.001
I was dating Bizu
when I met Gluant.

25:44.376 --> 25:47.338
He thought Gluant was a bad
guy for stealing me away.

25:47.546 --> 25:50.591
- If you ask me, they were both...
- You, don't leave town.

25:51.300 --> 25:53.719
But I'm flying to Montserrat
to record Rene Duchanel...

25:53.886 --> 25:57.014
You will not leave town. I may want
to ask you a few more questions.

25:57.306 --> 25:59.058
But I don't know anything.

25:59.224 --> 26:04.063
About life, about love.
Yes, you little wet puppy.

26:04.229 --> 26:06.482
But about the crime
you may know a lot.

26:06.648 --> 26:08.567
Inspector.

26:09.610 --> 26:11.278
Do I have to stay in town?

26:11.445 --> 26:13.197
Because next week I
have something...

26:14.490 --> 26:16.575
vague to do in New York.

26:16.909 --> 26:19.703
Well, if you absolutely have
to do something vague...

26:19.912 --> 26:21.455
feel free to go where you wish.

26:41.392 --> 26:45.145
I can't take you to Bizu, but I can
take you to Monsieur Vainqueur...

26:45.312 --> 26:47.773
the team's assistant coach.

26:47.940 --> 26:50.734
Well, I guess he's
the head coach now.

26:51.610 --> 26:53.904
- You wanted to see me?
- You are Vainqueur?

26:54.697 --> 26:57.199
Yes. And who are you?

26:57.366 --> 27:00.285
I am Inspector Clouseau.
Perhaps you have heard of me.

27:00.452 --> 27:01.787
No.

27:02.579 --> 27:03.789
Don't write that down.

27:05.416 --> 27:08.711
- What do you want?
- I am told that Bizu hated Gluant.

27:09.003 --> 27:11.422
A lot of people hated Gluant.

27:11.588 --> 27:13.257
Did you?

27:13.465 --> 27:17.177
I spent six years under his thumb
being verbally abused every day.

27:17.344 --> 27:19.388
Yes, I was not a fan
of Yves Gluant.

27:19.555 --> 27:21.348
And now he is dead...

27:21.515 --> 27:23.475
and you have his job.

27:23.642 --> 27:25.269
Ironic.

27:25.436 --> 27:27.438
Not every death is a tragedy.

27:27.604 --> 27:31.817
- And what was the...?
- Footsteps.

27:31.984 --> 27:33.569
It's a young woman...

27:33.736 --> 27:35.863
30 to 35 years old...

27:36.030 --> 27:39.199
5'2 ", 5'4", brunette.

27:39.366 --> 27:41.618
And she is wearing high heels.

27:41.827 --> 27:44.913
Perhaps a bit too formal
for the afternoon.

27:45.080 --> 27:47.124
And she has on...

27:47.499 --> 27:50.169
Chanel N°5.

27:56.508 --> 27:58.886
- Is anyone with you?
- No.

27:59.261 --> 28:01.680
Do you have a pair of
high heels in that bag?

28:01.847 --> 28:04.850
- No.
- Not even a small pair of pumps?

28:05.517 --> 28:07.436
- No.
- Who are you?

28:07.603 --> 28:09.646
I am Yuri, the trainer.

28:09.855 --> 28:12.524
And what is it you do
here, Yuri the trainer?

28:13.567 --> 28:14.818
I train.

28:14.985 --> 28:17.821
So you are Yuri the
trainer who trains.

28:22.785 --> 28:24.119
Do not leave Europe.

28:25.037 --> 28:26.830
But I have to go to Asia.

28:27.539 --> 28:28.957
Okay.

28:29.124 --> 28:30.709
Do not leave Europe or Asia.

28:32.378 --> 28:35.005
We have one match in Brazil.

28:35.172 --> 28:36.423
All right.

28:36.590 --> 28:40.010
Do not leave Europe,
Asia or the Americas.

28:41.679 --> 28:44.848
- Okay.
- Where is this famous soccer player?

28:45.057 --> 28:47.976
He is outside on the
practice field.

28:48.310 --> 28:51.730
Well, we shall see about Mr.
Bizu.

29:00.698 --> 29:02.783
I've got Bizu in the
interrogation room.

29:02.950 --> 29:03.993
What's the plan?

29:04.159 --> 29:07.496
I'm going to give him the
good-coplbad-cop routine.

29:09.248 --> 29:11.208
You are the soccer
player known as Bizu?

29:11.375 --> 29:14.086
- Yes.
- You were acquainted with Gluant?

29:14.753 --> 29:18.882
- I'm glad he's pushing up daisies.
- He is not pushing up daisies.

29:19.091 --> 29:20.426
He is dead.

29:21.385 --> 29:22.594
It's an idiom.

29:22.761 --> 29:26.348
You, sir, are the idiom.

29:26.515 --> 29:29.727
Now, unless you want to spend the
rest of your life in prison...

29:29.935 --> 29:33.272
you will answer the next question.
Did you kill him?

29:33.772 --> 29:36.525
I would have loved
to have killed him.

29:37.776 --> 29:40.654
But some lucky bastard
beat me to it.

29:41.405 --> 29:43.907
You disgust me.

29:44.283 --> 29:46.493
I'll be right back.

29:51.540 --> 29:52.750
Cigarette?

29:53.876 --> 29:55.419
No.

29:55.794 --> 29:56.837
Thanks.

29:57.338 --> 29:58.922
Good for you.

30:01.008 --> 30:02.634
Bizu...

30:05.804 --> 30:07.306
I know you didn't do it.

30:07.473 --> 30:10.059
Someone else did, and they
are trying to set you up.

30:10.601 --> 30:11.810
You'll help me?

30:12.394 --> 30:14.229
Of course I'll help you.

30:14.396 --> 30:18.442
Now, do you have any idea who might
have done this terrible thing?

30:18.650 --> 30:22.237
His partner in those stupid
restaurants, Larocque.

30:22.738 --> 30:25.532
Raymond Larocque,
the casino owner.

30:25.699 --> 30:28.702
Gluant would steal money from the
restaurants and use it to gamble.

30:29.036 --> 30:31.413
My guess is Larocque
got fed up...

30:31.664 --> 30:33.207
and had him killed.

30:33.374 --> 30:35.959
Bizu, I like you.

30:36.168 --> 30:38.087
I'm going to help you.

30:38.253 --> 30:41.465
You and I are going
to make a great team.

30:48.097 --> 30:50.849
The good-coplbad-cop routine
is working perfectly.

30:51.016 --> 30:54.395
You know, usually two
different cops do that.

31:13.789 --> 31:18.168
You know what we do to
prisoners who don't cooperate?

31:18.335 --> 31:20.504
We hook them up to the box.

31:22.548 --> 31:24.800
What is the box?

31:25.509 --> 31:29.346
Idiot. Like this, I
take one electrode...

31:29.513 --> 31:31.432
I put it here.

31:33.392 --> 31:35.686
I take the other one...

31:35.853 --> 31:37.062
I put it...

31:50.409 --> 31:52.828
So, what do you think?

31:52.995 --> 31:55.039
Bizu is innocent.

31:55.497 --> 31:57.207
How can you say that?

31:57.416 --> 32:00.210
Gluant suspended Bizu.
He stole his girlfriend.

32:00.753 --> 32:04.673
If it were me, I would have
killed him then and there.

32:04.840 --> 32:06.633
That's exactly what Bizu did.

32:06.800 --> 32:08.385
Ponton...

32:08.594 --> 32:10.471
a crime is like a jigsaw puzzle.

32:10.637 --> 32:13.098
You have to have the jig and
you have to have the saw.

32:13.265 --> 32:15.059
You have the jig, but no saw.

32:15.225 --> 32:16.894
Where is your saw?

32:17.102 --> 32:20.356
"Oh, Your Honor, I want to present
a case, but all I have is a jig.

32:20.522 --> 32:21.732
Is that okay?"

32:25.694 --> 32:27.154
What?

32:27.613 --> 32:28.822
Nothing.

32:28.989 --> 32:30.449
I thought you said:

32:33.410 --> 32:34.787
No.

32:43.545 --> 32:45.464
Strange.

33:00.521 --> 33:02.564
Oh, it's you.

34:12.842 --> 34:15.429
I hope you don't mind I let
myself in with the spare key.

34:15.596 --> 34:18.181
- Oh, no, no.
- And, look.

34:19.975 --> 34:21.976
I got your pants back
from the tailor.

34:22.143 --> 34:24.772
- Plus a spare.
- Good.

34:24.938 --> 34:27.815
- Would you like some water?
- Yes, please.

34:29.902 --> 34:35.366
You know, Nicole, this crime is
forcing me to use all my knowledge.

34:35.574 --> 34:39.911
Everything I have learned in a lifetime
of investigating is coming into play.

34:40.496 --> 34:43.165
Do you mind if I have these?
I haven't eaten.

34:43.331 --> 34:45.292
Oh, please, go ahead.

34:45.458 --> 34:49.963
Things are appearing in my mind that
I did not even realize was there.

34:50.130 --> 34:51.632
And yet the in...

34:51.799 --> 34:54.426
Oh, my God. The Heimlich!
The Heimlich!

35:12.403 --> 35:14.405
Are you feeling better?

35:14.947 --> 35:16.657
Yes, thank you. You
are so good at it.

35:16.824 --> 35:18.075
Where did you learn that?

35:18.242 --> 35:20.953
I used to practice on
mannequins, pillows...

35:21.120 --> 35:23.497
but frankly, it was the
expression on your face...

35:23.664 --> 35:25.541
that told me that you needed it.

35:25.708 --> 35:28.335
Now, Ponton, what
do you have for me?

35:28.502 --> 35:32.506
It seems you were right about Bizu.
He was just found dead...

35:32.673 --> 35:34.967
in the training
facility locker room.

35:35.134 --> 35:37.803
- Shot in the head.
- Was it fatal?

35:37.970 --> 35:40.222
- Yes.
- How fatal?

35:41.140 --> 35:42.349
Completely.

35:42.725 --> 35:44.143
I want to talk to him now.

35:44.601 --> 35:46.103
He's dead.

35:52.109 --> 35:53.986
You there. Halt.

35:56.322 --> 35:58.407
You are Yuri the
trainer who trains.

35:58.574 --> 35:59.908
Yeah, that's right.

36:00.075 --> 36:03.579
I am looking for a dead body. Perhaps
you can tell me where it is.

36:03.746 --> 36:06.415
Oh, yeah. I heard it was
in the locker room.

36:06.582 --> 36:10.502
You go down the hall, make
a right and two lefts.

36:13.756 --> 36:16.008
You are finding
something amusing here?

36:16.175 --> 36:17.801
I'll be honest with you. I...

36:18.010 --> 36:20.137
I find your accent quite funny.

36:20.304 --> 36:22.848
- Where are you from?
- From Russia.

36:23.390 --> 36:26.602
Gluant recruited me from
the Russian military gym.

36:29.146 --> 36:30.564
You need to work on your accent.

36:31.023 --> 36:32.441
- What?
- What?

36:32.900 --> 36:34.568
- What? What?
- What?

36:34.735 --> 36:36.403
- What?
- I don't have time for this.

36:36.570 --> 36:37.821
I have to solve a murder.

36:42.034 --> 36:44.286
Please, tell me what you saw.

36:44.453 --> 36:47.206
Well, I didn't see anything.

36:47.706 --> 36:49.583
I was passing by
the locker room.

36:49.750 --> 36:52.503
It was late, past time
anyone should be there.

36:52.711 --> 36:55.798
I heard movement on the other
side of the locker-room door.

36:55.964 --> 36:58.342
I heard Bizu say:

36:58.509 --> 37:01.720
"Oh, it's you."

37:02.179 --> 37:04.848
And then there was gunfire.

37:05.015 --> 37:07.685
Ponton, go to your databases.

37:07.851 --> 37:12.481
I want to interrogate every person
in Paris with the name "You."

37:13.565 --> 37:15.025
And, Ponton...

37:15.567 --> 37:17.528
don't you find it a bit
of a coincidence...

37:17.736 --> 37:21.949
that the body fell perfectly within
the chalk outline on the floor?

37:22.449 --> 37:25.744
I think they drew the
chalk outline later.

37:26.286 --> 37:29.790
We are dealing with some
kind of mastermind.

37:29.957 --> 37:33.836
Ponton, I want to interrogate
this man Raymond Larocque.

37:34.003 --> 37:35.671
Where is his casino?

37:46.974 --> 37:51.061
Park it close by. Unless you want
to know what else is good for you.

37:52.354 --> 37:54.148
You continue to
surprise me, inspector.

37:54.314 --> 37:59.153
Get used to it, Ponton. With me,
surprises are rarely unexpected.

38:02.156 --> 38:06.076
Yes, the weather is nice today.
Let's hope it continues.

38:06.243 --> 38:08.495
Ponton, go find security.

38:08.662 --> 38:12.124
Tell them I want to converse with Mr.
Raymond Larocque.

38:12.291 --> 38:15.753
- You're not coming?
- Something has come up.

38:15.961 --> 38:20.549
If the weather stays this mild,
we are all in for a treat.

38:20.716 --> 38:25.387
- Place your bets.
- I am in law enforcement too.

38:25.804 --> 38:27.097
Am I that obvious?

38:27.264 --> 38:31.643
No, it's just that I have
an ear for such things.

38:32.061 --> 38:34.188
Here is your mojito.

38:34.646 --> 38:37.316
- Flame it.
- No more bets.

38:41.570 --> 38:43.113
Impressive.

38:43.280 --> 38:45.449
I will remember that.

38:46.492 --> 38:50.371
I am Inspector Jacques Clouseau. I
am here on a very important case.

38:50.537 --> 38:53.499
Boswell. Nigel Boswell.
Agent 006.

38:53.666 --> 38:55.626
- Know what that means?
- Of course I do.

38:55.834 --> 38:57.378
You are one short
of the big time.

38:59.213 --> 39:01.298
I, too, am on a very
important case, inspector.

39:01.507 --> 39:03.592
So you understand what
I mean when I say...

39:03.759 --> 39:06.053
no one must know that I am here.

39:06.220 --> 39:08.847
I have just slipped my cell-phone
number into your pocket.

39:11.016 --> 39:12.518
Call me if you need any help.

39:13.310 --> 39:15.479
I will, inspector.

39:27.199 --> 39:28.450
Well...

39:28.617 --> 39:31.495
Monet. Very impressive,
Monsieur Larocque.

39:31.662 --> 39:33.205
Very impressive,
Inspector Clouseau.

39:33.372 --> 39:35.791
Please make yourself at home.
Now, how can I help you?

39:35.958 --> 39:39.003
I am investigating the
murder of Yves Gluant.

39:39.253 --> 39:40.879
Yves.

39:41.296 --> 39:42.881
Fascinating man.

39:43.048 --> 39:46.760
Would you happen to know what
he paid for the Pink Panther?

39:46.927 --> 39:49.138
He inherited it. It
cost him nothing.

39:49.596 --> 39:51.265
It cost him his life.

39:53.809 --> 39:56.311
I would like to take a
closer look at your bowls.

39:57.229 --> 39:59.982
- My what?
- Your bowls.

40:00.149 --> 40:01.817
I would like to take
a closer look...

40:01.984 --> 40:04.278
at your big brass bowls.

40:08.032 --> 40:10.659
- Okay.
- Thank you.

40:13.078 --> 40:14.580
Han Dynasty.

40:14.747 --> 40:17.541
- Very rare. Beautiful.
- I see you have an eye for antiques.

40:17.750 --> 40:20.419
Some here are real
and some are copies.

40:20.627 --> 40:22.296
I'm sure you can tell
which are which.

40:22.463 --> 40:25.215
Second century. Very rare.

40:25.758 --> 40:28.802
One should always handle an
antique vase from the inside.

40:28.969 --> 40:33.098
Otherwise the oil from the
hands can damage the patina.

40:34.475 --> 40:36.435
Pure alabaster.

40:36.602 --> 40:38.145
Lovely.

40:44.276 --> 40:48.405
That's odd. What I did, I
went like this, and then...

40:55.913 --> 40:58.374
This is weird.

41:01.377 --> 41:04.380
Why did you take out a
life-insurance policy on Gluant?

41:04.546 --> 41:08.300
The insurance company won't pay
unless the murderer is caught.

41:08.467 --> 41:10.803
And if it turns out to be me...

41:10.969 --> 41:13.263
they won't pay at all.
Do you understand?

41:13.972 --> 41:16.934
But you stood to gain from
Gluant's death, didn't you?

41:17.101 --> 41:19.395
Gain? What would I gain?

41:19.853 --> 41:22.356
Gluant's share of
the restaurants.

41:22.523 --> 41:24.650
Oh, the restaurants
were a disaster.

41:25.234 --> 41:28.278
Gluant was siphoning money
out faster than it came in.

41:28.445 --> 41:32.032
My only consolation was he'd lose
the money gambling in my casino.

41:32.449 --> 41:35.077
But after a while his losses
became so ridiculous...

41:35.244 --> 41:37.871
he promised me his
ring as collateral.

41:38.706 --> 41:41.000
But someone had words
with Gluant...

41:41.166 --> 41:42.793
the night before he was killed.

41:43.252 --> 41:45.796
- Didn't you?
- No.

41:46.338 --> 41:50.551
You didn't threaten to break his
legs and then crush him into powder?

41:50.968 --> 41:52.177
No.

41:53.345 --> 41:55.139
Perhaps I saw that on TV.

42:00.060 --> 42:03.313
Well, I can certainly think
of a better place for this.

42:07.860 --> 42:10.529
That's my personalized
cell-phone tone ring.

42:17.161 --> 42:18.454
Hello?

42:18.620 --> 42:20.122
Yes, this is Inspector...

42:20.581 --> 42:23.000
Yes, I could meet you.
In the restaurant?

42:23.709 --> 42:25.210
Yes, of course. Right away.

42:25.377 --> 42:29.006
Gentlemen, something has come up.
Please excuse me.

42:29.173 --> 42:30.424
- Monsieur Larocque.
- Yes.

42:30.591 --> 42:32.009
Is this vase of great value?

42:32.384 --> 42:34.219
It is a worthless imitation.

42:34.386 --> 42:35.971
Good.

42:38.557 --> 42:40.684
But that desk was...

42:40.893 --> 42:42.102
priceless.

42:48.484 --> 42:50.152
- Clouseau.
- Oh, yes.

42:50.319 --> 42:53.238
I need your help. Now, it's very
important that you remain calm...

42:53.405 --> 42:56.325
and you do not turn around.
- Remain calm. Do not turn around.

42:56.492 --> 42:58.786
Behind you in the casino
are the Gas Mask Bandits.

42:59.453 --> 43:02.081
Oh, my God! The
Gas Mask Bandits!

43:03.082 --> 43:05.209
- All Europe is looking for them.
- How can I help?

43:05.376 --> 43:08.253
- Just give me your coat.
- Yes, of course. Why?

43:08.420 --> 43:09.963
I'm not supposed to be here.

43:10.130 --> 43:12.508
But I can't let the Gas
Mask Bandits escape.

43:51.922 --> 43:55.134
- Put it on.
- Yes. Yes, of course. But why?

43:55.634 --> 43:58.429
I'm not supposed to
be here, remember?

44:00.014 --> 44:01.473
Inspector.

44:02.975 --> 44:05.144
My God, man, that was fantastic.

44:12.568 --> 44:15.654
Inspector, was Clouseau's plan to set
a trap for the Gas Mask Bandits?

44:15.821 --> 44:18.824
Does Clouseau think the Bandits are
connected to the Pink Panther?

44:18.991 --> 44:20.701
Is Clouseau going to
be promoted, sir?

44:20.868 --> 44:25.122
I cannot comment on
ongoing investigations.

44:25.289 --> 44:26.498
Drive.

44:28.334 --> 44:29.960
Inspector?

44:30.336 --> 44:31.587
Clouseau?

44:35.466 --> 44:36.842
Good one.

44:37.009 --> 44:38.510
Thank you.

44:38.677 --> 44:40.679
Now, what do you have for me?

44:40.846 --> 44:42.931
We have rounded up all
the people in Paris...

44:43.098 --> 44:47.019
with the name "You." - Finally,
we are getting somewhere.

45:01.742 --> 45:03.535
Read that back.

45:08.040 --> 45:09.667
You may go.

45:11.960 --> 45:12.961
You speak Chinese?

45:13.587 --> 45:15.422
What, you don't think
I speak Chinese?

45:16.090 --> 45:18.258
If I don't speak Chinese,
what are we doing here?

45:18.592 --> 45:20.552
That must be funny
around the water cooler.

45:20.719 --> 45:22.846
"Oh, Inspector Clouseau
does not speak Chinese."

45:23.013 --> 45:25.474
Let's take him out for lunch.
We will all speak Chinese.

45:25.641 --> 45:27.434
"He won't know what we
are talking about."

45:27.601 --> 45:30.145
Is that what you like to do?
Is that funny?

45:30.312 --> 45:32.564
Of course I speak Chinese.

45:37.903 --> 45:39.613
Clouseau?

46:06.765 --> 46:08.559
Bonjour, Nicole.

46:08.934 --> 46:11.228
Could I see you in my
office in a few minutes?

46:11.437 --> 46:14.398
I'll be right with
you, inspector.

46:42.092 --> 46:43.302
Yes, inspector?

46:44.136 --> 46:45.346
Nicole.

46:45.512 --> 46:48.807
The weather has
been so pleasant.

46:48.974 --> 46:54.104
I was wondering if you think
it's going to stay this mild.

46:55.314 --> 46:58.150
I certainly hope so.

46:59.652 --> 47:02.571
But do you think the weather...

47:02.738 --> 47:05.282
is going to change?

47:05.824 --> 47:07.951
Let's keep our
fingers crossed...

47:08.160 --> 47:10.704
that it stays this mild.

47:11.997 --> 47:14.291
And here's another one for you!

47:16.001 --> 47:17.753
Now let's see who you are.

47:19.672 --> 47:22.091
It is "Inspector Dreyfus."

47:22.257 --> 47:24.885
The intruder is obviously
wearing a flesh mask.

47:25.052 --> 47:26.553
But that will come off.

47:28.430 --> 47:30.432
My face!

47:35.020 --> 47:37.147
Maybe there is a seam
under your hairline.

47:37.356 --> 47:39.233
I'll just turn you around.

47:46.365 --> 47:49.493
Are you feeling any better?
I am so sorry, inspector.

47:50.327 --> 47:52.079
Let's just forget it.

47:52.246 --> 47:55.666
I thought I would stop by and let you
know how we are doing on the case.

47:55.833 --> 47:58.210
Oh, I'll just...

47:58.377 --> 48:01.547
stay back here.
- Yes, of course.

48:02.047 --> 48:05.009
I see you have one of these
collapsible pointers.

48:05.175 --> 48:06.385
So very useful.

48:06.552 --> 48:09.388
It is so degrading to have
to point with your finger...

48:09.555 --> 48:11.724
or one of those long
wooden sticks...

48:11.890 --> 48:14.685
like you are some sort
of primitive oaf.

48:14.893 --> 48:19.898
But you have one of these, you just
snap it open and you are ready to go.

48:20.065 --> 48:21.900
The case. The case, Clouseau.

48:22.234 --> 48:24.445
Yes, the case.

48:24.611 --> 48:28.615
The case is going quite well. I
have prepared a list of suspects.

48:29.616 --> 48:31.744
And how many suspects
do you have?

48:32.286 --> 48:34.747
Twenty-seven thousand six
hundred eighty-three.

48:35.706 --> 48:38.709
It's just a matter of
time now, isn't it?

48:38.917 --> 48:42.254
- Have you eliminated any suspects?
- Yes.

48:42.880 --> 48:44.131
One.

48:44.715 --> 48:46.800
One. And who would that be?

48:47.760 --> 48:49.011
Gluant.

48:50.220 --> 48:52.431
Gluant is the victim.

48:53.057 --> 48:55.267
Excellent, inspector.

48:55.434 --> 48:57.436
We think alike.

48:57.936 --> 49:02.232
One clue leading
inexorably to the next.

49:04.318 --> 49:05.569
Just leave it.

49:07.905 --> 49:09.365
I assure you, inspector...

49:09.782 --> 49:13.160
I will soon have your
criminal cornered like a...

49:13.327 --> 49:15.829
Like a... Like... Like a...
Like...

49:15.996 --> 49:19.083
Like something... Something that you...
You corner.

49:19.458 --> 49:22.586
- Well put.
- I see you enjoy wordplay.

49:22.753 --> 49:24.421
We will have to have
lunch one day...

49:24.630 --> 49:27.841
and engage in a little
verbal jousting.

49:28.509 --> 49:30.969
I'm sure you're quite
the raconteur.

49:33.889 --> 49:35.182
Yes.

49:36.725 --> 49:39.311
So I will call you for lunch.

49:43.315 --> 49:46.193
There's only one item on the
agenda of this committee:

49:46.860 --> 49:50.990
To approve the list of nominees
for our nation's highest award...

49:51.156 --> 49:52.658
the Medal of Honor.

49:52.825 --> 49:55.119
The two nominees are...

49:55.619 --> 49:56.912
Charles Dreyfus...

49:59.540 --> 50:00.874
No.

50:02.626 --> 50:04.795
And Sister Marie-Hugette...

50:05.838 --> 50:08.716
whose selfless concern for
our nation's orphans...

50:08.882 --> 50:11.301
is an inspiration to us all.

50:11.468 --> 50:14.847
I would like to add one more name
for the committee's consideration.

50:15.014 --> 50:18.517
Inspector Jacques Clouseau, the man
who came here from a small village...

50:18.684 --> 50:20.811
to investigate the
murder of Yves Gluant...

50:20.978 --> 50:24.189
who just last night captured the
notorious Gas Mask Bandits.

50:24.356 --> 50:27.359
Yes. Interesting idea.

50:28.277 --> 50:30.279
- An average Frenchman.
- Exactly.

50:30.446 --> 50:32.323
Excellent idea.

50:32.489 --> 50:34.700
All in favor?

50:34.867 --> 50:38.287
How is it I was not informed of
Clouseau's going to that casino?

50:38.454 --> 50:41.999
- It was the middle of the night.
- Oh, it was the middle of the night.

50:42.166 --> 50:44.376
What, you did not
want to wake me?

50:44.543 --> 50:46.462
I want to know of
Clouseau's whereabouts...

50:46.628 --> 50:48.922
every hour, 24 hours a day.

50:49.089 --> 50:51.759
You miss one call, and I will
have you kicked off the force.

50:51.925 --> 50:54.470
- Do you understand?
- Yes, sir.

50:54.636 --> 50:57.056
Why are you not with him now?

50:57.222 --> 51:00.559
- I'm here.
- Get out.

51:03.604 --> 51:05.898
- Clouseau.
- Ponton.

51:06.065 --> 51:08.484
Let's call it a day. I am tired.

51:08.651 --> 51:11.528
I just wanted to see where you
are with the investigation.

51:11.695 --> 51:14.114
Good idea, Ponton. To let
the subconscious mind...

51:14.281 --> 51:17.242
work on the case while we sleep.
Now then, what are the facts?

51:17.451 --> 51:18.702
Yves Gluant was found...

51:18.911 --> 51:21.205
at the international
championship semifinal...

51:21.372 --> 51:24.083
with a poison dart in his neck.
- The crime!

51:24.249 --> 51:27.044
Bizu wanted to kill him,
but is now himself dead.

51:27.252 --> 51:28.712
A complication!

51:28.879 --> 51:30.339
Gluant was siphoning
off money...

51:30.506 --> 51:32.216
- from Larocque.
- A motive!

51:32.424 --> 51:34.551
And close to the body
was the singer, Xania.

51:34.968 --> 51:36.387
Xania is not the killer.

51:36.553 --> 51:38.889
But I suspect she knows more
than she is telling me.

51:39.056 --> 51:41.850
- Where is she now?
- She left suddenly for New York.

51:42.017 --> 51:45.604
We are going to have to follow her
and find out what she is up to.

51:45.771 --> 51:47.231
And if I am going to America...

51:47.398 --> 51:50.275
I am going to have to speak with
a flawless American accent...

51:50.442 --> 51:52.861
so as not to arouse suspicion.

51:53.278 --> 51:56.991
So find me the greatest
accent coach in the world.

51:57.449 --> 51:59.451
I would like to buy a hamburger.

51:59.952 --> 52:02.496
I would like to buy a hamburger.

52:02.705 --> 52:06.500
I would like to buy a hamburger.

52:06.667 --> 52:08.419
I would like to buy...

52:08.585 --> 52:11.463
a hamburger.

52:11.630 --> 52:13.716
No, no, no. Let's break it down.

52:13.882 --> 52:15.134
I.

52:15.300 --> 52:16.927
- I.
- I.

52:17.094 --> 52:18.554
- Would.
- Would.

52:18.721 --> 52:21.807
- Would.
- Would.

52:22.641 --> 52:26.103
- Would.
- Weird.

52:26.603 --> 52:28.772
Would.

52:28.981 --> 52:31.108
Would.

52:31.317 --> 52:32.401
- Like.
- Like.

52:32.568 --> 52:33.986
- Like.
- Like.

52:34.153 --> 52:35.612
- To.
- To.

52:35.821 --> 52:37.614
- To.
- To.

52:38.198 --> 52:39.658
To.

52:40.492 --> 52:41.785
To.

52:41.994 --> 52:43.245
- Buy.
- Buy.

52:43.412 --> 52:44.455
- Buy.
- Bee.

52:44.663 --> 52:47.124
- Buy.
- Bye-bye.

52:47.291 --> 52:49.668
- A.
- A.

52:49.835 --> 52:52.004
Hamburger.

52:52.171 --> 52:53.756
Hamburger.

52:53.922 --> 52:55.382
Hamburger.

52:56.550 --> 53:00.512
- Hamburger.
- Hamburger.

53:00.721 --> 53:02.973
I would like to buy a hamburger.

53:03.182 --> 53:04.725
I would like to buy a damburger.

53:05.726 --> 53:07.603
It's not "damburger." Hamburger.

53:07.770 --> 53:10.856
I'm not saying "damburger." I said,
"I would like to buy a damburger."

53:11.065 --> 53:14.485
- I would like to buy a hamburger.
- I would like to buy the hamburger.

53:14.652 --> 53:17.237
- Hamburger.
- I would like to buy a hamburger!

53:17.404 --> 53:19.073
- Maybe we should stop.
- We don't quit.

53:19.239 --> 53:21.033
We do not quit. Again! Again!

53:21.742 --> 53:24.870
- I would like to buy a hamburger.
- I would like to buy a hamburger!

53:25.037 --> 53:28.207
- I would like to buy a hamburger.
- I would like to buy hamburger.

53:28.415 --> 53:31.135
- I would like to buy a hamburger.
- I would like to buy a hamburger.

53:31.159 --> 53:34.088
- I would like to buy a hamburger.
- I would like to buy hamburger!

53:34.254 --> 53:35.798
I would like to buy a hamburger.

54:07.913 --> 54:10.290
- Have you ever had a hamburger?
- Well, of course not.

54:10.457 --> 54:13.544
It's a disgusting American food.

54:46.452 --> 54:49.121
I never see you with women.

54:50.247 --> 54:51.915
I'm married.

54:53.459 --> 54:55.586
You don't wear a ring.

54:55.794 --> 54:57.212
To protect her.

54:57.379 --> 54:59.715
I'm afraid some villain
might threaten her.

54:59.882 --> 55:01.800
Yes.

55:01.967 --> 55:04.053
Tell me about her.

55:05.304 --> 55:09.266
I consider her the most
beautiful woman in the world.

55:10.809 --> 55:12.770
What about yourself?

55:12.936 --> 55:17.775
No, I don't consider
myself a beautiful woman.

55:18.067 --> 55:20.611
I mean, is there a
woman in your life?

55:20.778 --> 55:22.279
Oh, no.

55:22.488 --> 55:25.324
Love has not yet come my way.

55:25.491 --> 55:28.494
How could Inspector Clouseau
be with a simple woman?

55:28.661 --> 55:32.956
She would have to be so
extraordinary in order to keep up.

55:33.832 --> 55:35.459
It's hard.

55:39.672 --> 55:43.217
- What is?
- For you to meet someone.

55:43.801 --> 55:45.761
Oh, yes.

55:46.720 --> 55:48.931
We have a big day tomorrow.

55:49.098 --> 55:53.811
We will go to Xania's hotel and
find out what she is up to.

55:54.478 --> 55:57.439
- Good night, Ponton.
- Good night, Clouseau.

55:58.357 --> 55:59.942
- Good one.
- Thank you.

56:05.698 --> 56:07.658
I got her hotel phone records.

56:07.866 --> 56:09.410
Xania made two phone calls...

56:09.576 --> 56:12.246
to a notorious black-market
diamond cutter.

56:12.830 --> 56:14.999
There she is! Newspapers!

56:20.879 --> 56:22.548
Newspapers!

56:25.259 --> 56:26.927
Newspapers!

56:28.929 --> 56:30.180
Newspapers!

56:50.409 --> 56:52.411
Floor 12.

56:55.247 --> 56:58.208
I smell something fishy.

57:02.588 --> 57:04.381
May I help you?

57:18.854 --> 57:20.898
Good teamwork.

57:29.782 --> 57:33.452
Stop! Stop whatever it is you are doing!
You are defenseless!

57:33.619 --> 57:36.580
We have already taken care of your
thugs patrolling the building.

57:36.747 --> 57:38.415
I don't have any thugs.

57:38.624 --> 57:40.209
You don't?

57:40.668 --> 57:44.254
Ponton, I think we owe
those men an apology.

57:44.463 --> 57:46.674
And what is it you are cutting?

57:47.132 --> 57:49.134
Pink diamond. Clear.

57:49.343 --> 57:52.638
- Clear?
- It's not the Pink Panther.

57:53.931 --> 57:56.850
And what are you doing
here sneaking around?

57:57.893 --> 58:00.562
This purse once belonged
to Josephine Baker.

58:00.729 --> 58:03.524
It was falling apart, so I had
it studded with diamonds...

58:03.691 --> 58:05.693
to wear on-stage at the
Presidential Ball.

58:05.901 --> 58:08.612
Well, why did you just not
tell me why you were coming?

58:09.196 --> 58:11.740
I can't be seen at
a diamond cutter.

58:11.907 --> 58:13.784
Not after what happened.

58:16.203 --> 58:20.040
That may be one of your
mysterious clients now.

58:20.416 --> 58:21.959
Hello?

58:22.334 --> 58:25.879
Yes, I am the person in
charge of the phone bill.

58:26.046 --> 58:28.132
Well, I'm somewhat
happy with my service.

58:28.298 --> 58:30.300
Twelve months with
that many minutes?

58:30.509 --> 58:32.469
Plus free minutes per month?

58:32.886 --> 58:35.889
Yes, sign me up. Yes,
Jacques Clouseau...

58:36.056 --> 58:38.434
credit card number:

58:51.947 --> 58:55.659
Yes? Yes, you may have
my e-mail address.

58:56.535 --> 59:00.372
DoctorKnockers@aol.com.

59:01.707 --> 59:05.753
Well, I think I just got
myself a pretty good deal.

59:09.715 --> 59:13.344
- When are you leaving the city?
- I'm leaving tomorrow. Yeah.

59:14.386 --> 59:17.556
I may have to seduce her, Ponton,
in order to get her to talk.

59:17.723 --> 59:19.725
- Part of the job.
- Talk about what?

59:19.892 --> 59:22.811
I want to find out what time her
plane is leaving in the morning.

59:22.978 --> 59:25.397
- Why not just ask her?
- Too obvious.

59:25.564 --> 59:28.150
I may have to pump
her for information.

59:28.317 --> 59:31.028
- I see.
- Inspector...

59:32.071 --> 59:35.199
would you like to join me
for dinner at the Waldorf?

59:35.741 --> 59:37.534
Certainly, mademoiselle.

59:37.743 --> 59:39.912
Say, 8:00?

59:40.537 --> 59:41.872
Eight o'clock.

59:42.247 --> 59:45.751
Say, I don't know, my
room on the second floor?

59:46.251 --> 59:49.463
"I don't know, my room
on the second floor."

59:50.255 --> 59:51.590
I'll see you then.

59:54.176 --> 59:56.095
It might be a trap.

59:56.261 --> 59:58.222
Who cares?

01:00:16.031 --> 01:00:18.450
Welcome to my room, inspector.

01:00:19.618 --> 01:00:21.412
It is lovely weather
we are having.

01:00:37.136 --> 01:00:40.723
Oh, yes, baby. Oh, yes.

01:00:49.732 --> 01:00:51.275
Why?

01:00:52.151 --> 01:00:53.444
Why what?

01:00:53.610 --> 01:00:57.406
Why were you being
so elusive today?

01:00:58.240 --> 01:01:00.117
I was afraid of Larocque.

01:01:00.284 --> 01:01:04.496
- He might be following me.
- Larocque? The casino owner?

01:01:04.663 --> 01:01:06.665
He sent out word threatening
to kill anyone...

01:01:06.832 --> 01:01:08.625
in possession of
the Pink Panther.

01:01:08.834 --> 01:01:10.794
He believes it belongs to him.

01:01:11.211 --> 01:01:12.796
But why would he follow you?

01:01:13.172 --> 01:01:15.883
I was in New York to
see a diamond cutter.

01:01:16.050 --> 01:01:17.968
He might draw the
wrong conclusion.

01:01:18.385 --> 01:01:19.762
You know...

01:01:19.928 --> 01:01:25.351
a man sitting here in
your private suite...

01:01:25.517 --> 01:01:27.478
so close to you...

01:01:27.686 --> 01:01:29.938
might draw the wrong
conclusion too.

01:01:30.439 --> 01:01:32.650
Or the right one.

01:01:33.484 --> 01:01:35.527
I've heard things
about you, inspector.

01:01:36.320 --> 01:01:38.155
What sort of things?

01:01:38.322 --> 01:01:40.741
That you really know
how to treat a woman.

01:01:46.914 --> 01:01:50.125
Yes. Yes.

01:01:50.626 --> 01:01:53.462
Let the games begin.

01:01:54.838 --> 01:01:57.883
Let me just slip away.

01:02:12.189 --> 01:02:13.857
Yes!

01:02:19.238 --> 01:02:21.365
No! No, no! No, no!

01:02:22.408 --> 01:02:25.411
My miracle pill for
the middle-aged man.

01:02:35.838 --> 01:02:37.089
Give it back.

01:02:51.186 --> 01:02:52.896
Inspector?

01:02:54.231 --> 01:02:59.236
- Are you all right in there?
- I hope you're getting yourself ready.

01:03:04.783 --> 01:03:06.744
Inspector? Are you sure
you're okay in there?

01:03:06.952 --> 01:03:10.164
Yes, I am. I'm fine. I'm just
getting in the mood for love.

01:03:39.485 --> 01:03:41.820
Well, hello.

01:03:49.828 --> 01:03:52.790
We need fresh towels in 204.

01:03:56.043 --> 01:03:59.296
Don't ask why, just do it.

01:03:59.505 --> 01:04:02.675
You have the flight number. He
leaves tomorrow out of JFK.

01:04:02.841 --> 01:04:07.096
He'll be easy to spot. He's got
white hair, a thin mustache...

01:04:07.262 --> 01:04:10.891
brimming with self-confidence
and completely lost.

01:04:19.566 --> 01:04:21.652
- Did you get the stuff?
- Yes.

01:04:21.819 --> 01:04:23.195
Good.

01:04:23.362 --> 01:04:27.449
Give it to me. Airline
food is for suckers.

01:04:27.616 --> 01:04:31.328
I will smuggle this on.
Just act cool.

01:04:38.043 --> 01:04:40.045
- Hey, that's Xania!
- Hello.

01:04:40.212 --> 01:04:42.589
Hi. Yes, thank you.

01:04:42.756 --> 01:04:45.217
I still think she is
hiding something, Ponton.

01:04:45.384 --> 01:04:46.677
What?

01:04:46.885 --> 01:04:49.888
If I knew what she was hiding, then
it wouldn't be hidden, would it?

01:04:50.055 --> 01:04:52.057
- All right. Thank you.
- One more! One more!

01:04:52.224 --> 01:04:53.642
Okay, let's go. Next.

01:04:53.809 --> 01:04:55.978
Nothing to declare.

01:04:59.732 --> 01:05:02.860
- Come on through.
- Hand check on two.

01:05:04.236 --> 01:05:06.238
- This your bag, sir?
- Yes, it is.

01:05:06.405 --> 01:05:09.533
- We'll have to hand check it.
- Go ahead. I have nothing to hide.

01:05:09.700 --> 01:05:11.035
In my bag.

01:05:11.702 --> 01:05:13.454
Come with me, sir.

01:05:15.080 --> 01:05:16.832
Wait here, pal.

01:05:27.593 --> 01:05:30.012
It's a harmless pocketknife.

01:05:34.808 --> 01:05:37.311
It's a harmless pair of...
Numchucks?

01:05:41.273 --> 01:05:44.735
I don't... I don't even own a mace.
I don't know where that came from.

01:05:50.949 --> 01:05:52.826
I've never seen that
stuff in my life.

01:05:53.035 --> 01:05:54.703
Jimbo!

01:05:55.579 --> 01:05:57.956
You don't need Jimbo.

01:06:01.251 --> 01:06:03.504
- Jimbo, stay.
- What's in your pocket, sir?

01:06:03.712 --> 01:06:05.673
- Nothing.
- Sir, I'll say again...

01:06:05.839 --> 01:06:07.925
what's in your pocket?
- Nothing.

01:06:09.093 --> 01:06:12.179
I'm gonna ask you again,
what's in your pocket, sir?

01:06:13.263 --> 01:06:14.640
All right.

01:06:14.807 --> 01:06:17.476
I have, in my pocket...

01:06:17.643 --> 01:06:20.354
a couple of "hambwortsforts."

01:06:21.021 --> 01:06:22.856
What?

01:06:24.149 --> 01:06:27.444
I have in my pocket...

01:06:27.778 --> 01:06:30.239
a couple of "dolvargars."

01:06:30.948 --> 01:06:32.282
Sir?

01:06:33.117 --> 01:06:39.081
- Sir, in your pocket you have?
- All right, I have four "hanholders."

01:06:39.415 --> 01:06:41.125
I'm sorry. Once more.

01:06:42.668 --> 01:06:43.961
Again!

01:06:44.128 --> 01:06:45.587
- Sir...
- Hey, what's that?

01:06:47.840 --> 01:06:50.551
- Sir... Sir, I'm losing my patience.
- Oh, you are?

01:06:50.718 --> 01:06:52.302
- You are losing your patience?
- Yes.

01:06:52.469 --> 01:06:55.222
I'm simply telling you I have
a couple of "tamburthers."

01:06:55.597 --> 01:06:59.018
I've got an End darter down on six.
I've got an End darter down on six!

01:06:59.184 --> 01:07:01.854
- Locked and loaded, sir!
- Show me your hands, sir!

01:07:02.021 --> 01:07:03.814
All right, I'll just show you.

01:07:04.857 --> 01:07:07.234
- No, no, no! Stay here, sir.
- Sic him, W!

01:07:21.457 --> 01:07:25.210
- Yes, that's him!
- Inspector, what is a "damburgert"?

01:07:25.377 --> 01:07:28.839
Inspector, how does it feel
to have let down the nation?

01:07:34.511 --> 01:07:38.974
So much for the heroic
Inspector Clouseau.

01:07:41.101 --> 01:07:45.648
Well, this is a glorious
day for France.

01:07:46.231 --> 01:07:47.983
How so, chief inspector?

01:07:48.150 --> 01:07:50.944
Because a stupid idiot
named Clouseau...

01:07:51.111 --> 01:07:55.199
is going to be stripped of his
rank while I take over his case.

01:07:55.407 --> 01:07:57.618
You have a second
man named Clouseau?

01:07:57.785 --> 01:08:01.163
My God. Leave us
alone for a moment.

01:08:01.330 --> 01:08:04.875
You, out. Go, go. Go. I
must have a private word...

01:08:05.084 --> 01:08:08.003
with Inspector Clouseau.

01:08:08.170 --> 01:08:09.755
Understand something, Clouseau.

01:08:09.922 --> 01:08:13.384
When I made you an inspector,
it was not because I thought...

01:08:13.592 --> 01:08:15.678
you had any value
as a detective.

01:08:15.844 --> 01:08:21.140
It was because I thought you were the
stupidest policeman in all of France.

01:08:21.558 --> 01:08:24.812
A hopeless, deluded idiot.

01:08:25.270 --> 01:08:27.606
Then I was not promoted
for my merits?

01:08:27.814 --> 01:08:31.318
I only made you inspector
because I needed someone...

01:08:31.484 --> 01:08:34.029
who would quietly get nowhere
until I was ready...

01:08:34.196 --> 01:08:36.198
to take over the case myself.

01:08:36.657 --> 01:08:38.617
I was trying to catch a killer.

01:08:38.783 --> 01:08:41.328
You were trying...

01:08:42.955 --> 01:08:47.792
You were trying to become a hero.
Well, you will be stripped...

01:08:47.960 --> 01:08:50.546
of your rank, ridiculed
by the media...

01:08:50.712 --> 01:08:52.296
and I will be done with you.

01:08:52.464 --> 01:08:56.635
And now if you will excuse me,
ex-inspector, I must go and prepare...

01:08:56.801 --> 01:09:00.346
for the arrest which will win
me the Medal of Honor...

01:09:00.514 --> 01:09:05.602
catapult me to the National Assembly,
and after that, who knows?

01:09:06.228 --> 01:09:09.314
- Goodbye, Clouseau.
- Shall we lock him up?

01:09:09.481 --> 01:09:11.024
Look at him.

01:09:11.191 --> 01:09:15.279
He is finished. Let him
go home to obscurity.

01:09:24.787 --> 01:09:26.372
You knew?

01:09:49.270 --> 01:09:50.981
Ponton...

01:09:51.482 --> 01:09:53.734
things were not as I
supposed they were.

01:09:55.027 --> 01:09:58.656
And if I ever made
you look foolish...

01:09:59.239 --> 01:10:01.450
I am sorry.

01:10:02.701 --> 01:10:06.372
It was an honor serving
under you, sir.

01:10:18.384 --> 01:10:20.177
Good one.

01:10:43.951 --> 01:10:45.828
The Internet.

01:10:45.995 --> 01:10:47.788
Hello, old friend.

01:10:50.582 --> 01:10:54.128
"To download your new
cell-phone ringtone...

01:10:54.586 --> 01:10:58.465
press the button that
says 'download."'

01:10:59.091 --> 01:11:03.887
I take the mouse and I
click, but do not drag...

01:11:04.096 --> 01:11:08.017
the button that says "download."

01:11:18.527 --> 01:11:21.113
Gentlemen, and lady,
good morning.

01:11:21.280 --> 01:11:24.366
Meet Dr. Li How Pang.

01:11:24.533 --> 01:11:27.745
He was, of course, in the VIP
box when Gluant was killed.

01:11:27.953 --> 01:11:31.790
Coincidentally, Dr. Pang would
send Gluant large sums of money.

01:11:31.957 --> 01:11:36.337
Presumably, Gluant was to invest
these sums on Pang's behalf.

01:11:36.503 --> 01:11:40.466
But being a compulsive gambler,
Gluant took the money...

01:11:40.632 --> 01:11:42.926
and gambled it all away.

01:11:43.552 --> 01:11:45.929
So Pang had the motive.

01:11:46.347 --> 01:11:49.099
He had the opportunity.

01:11:49.308 --> 01:11:53.937
Pang is in France for the
president's ball tonight.

01:11:54.104 --> 01:11:57.941
We will arrest him there for
the murder of Yves Gluant.

01:11:58.108 --> 01:12:00.194
Bravo, chief inspector.

01:12:01.028 --> 01:12:04.031
I am pleased to announce that I
am personally taking over...

01:12:04.198 --> 01:12:08.410
the Pink Panther investigation
and that an arrest is imminent.

01:12:08.577 --> 01:12:10.329
- Thank you.
- Chief inspector...

01:12:10.496 --> 01:12:12.790
the coroner has announced
that Bizu was killed...

01:12:12.998 --> 01:12:16.335
with a perfect shot to the occipital lobe.
Any comments?

01:12:16.502 --> 01:12:18.921
The occipital lobe?

01:12:19.838 --> 01:12:21.840
It's irrelevant.

01:12:24.677 --> 01:12:27.137
The occipital lobe.

01:12:41.193 --> 01:12:43.362
That makes me feel good.

01:12:51.161 --> 01:12:52.997
Zoom.

01:13:01.255 --> 01:13:04.091
Of course.

01:13:08.887 --> 01:13:11.265
Ponton, I need you
over here immediately.

01:13:11.432 --> 01:13:14.226
We are back on the case.

01:13:17.604 --> 01:13:21.692
Nicole, I believe Bizu and Gluant
were killed by the same person.

01:13:21.859 --> 01:13:24.153
And that the killer will
strike again tonight.

01:13:24.320 --> 01:13:26.822
I want you to meet me at
the presidential palace.

01:13:27.031 --> 01:13:30.200
And bring my vinyl bag marked
"presidential palace."

01:13:30.367 --> 01:13:34.663
And hurry! Xania is
in grave danger.

01:13:36.415 --> 01:13:40.461
Ponton, we must get to the
presidential palace immediately!

01:13:40.627 --> 01:13:42.963
- Put your seat belt on.
- I don't need a seat belt.

01:13:43.130 --> 01:13:44.715
Let's see what this baby can do!

01:13:53.057 --> 01:13:55.768
No. Clouseau should
not be on this list.

01:13:55.934 --> 01:13:58.687
He is no longer allowed
at state affairs.

01:13:58.854 --> 01:14:02.399
He has been disgraced
and humiliated.

01:14:02.608 --> 01:14:05.653
But what about all the reporters
who will want to come in?

01:14:05.819 --> 01:14:09.948
When the time is right,
let them pour in.

01:14:29.968 --> 01:14:31.804
Clouseau.

01:14:33.639 --> 01:14:35.724
I'm sorry, but your name
is not on the list.

01:14:35.891 --> 01:14:37.601
Not on the list?

01:14:38.769 --> 01:14:41.021
Dreyfus must have made
sure you cannot get in.

01:14:47.194 --> 01:14:48.570
Ponton.

01:14:54.201 --> 01:14:56.286
- Inspector, here is your bag.
- Good work, Nicole.

01:14:57.371 --> 01:14:59.331
- What is that?
- Camouflage. Let's go.

01:15:00.541 --> 01:15:01.977
- Nicole.
- Yes?

01:15:02.001 --> 01:15:04.003
- One last thing.
- Yes?

01:15:10.759 --> 01:15:12.052
It's evening...

01:15:12.344 --> 01:15:15.306
and you look beautiful
without your glasses.

01:15:16.682 --> 01:15:19.059
Thank you, inspector.

01:15:44.835 --> 01:15:46.420
- Chief inspector.
- What?

01:15:46.545 --> 01:15:49.506
Our men have reported a
sighting of Inspector Clouseau.

01:15:50.507 --> 01:15:51.508
Clouseau?

01:15:52.384 --> 01:15:56.180
I know what he's up to. He wants
to try to make the arrest himself.

01:15:57.389 --> 01:16:01.644
If you see Clouseau, put him
in cuffs for trespassing...

01:16:01.727 --> 01:16:03.729
and parade him
through the party.

01:16:13.489 --> 01:16:15.407
Dr. Pang has arrived.

01:16:18.994 --> 01:16:21.622
We will take him after
the first song.

01:16:23.165 --> 01:16:24.875
Yes, yes. Very true.

01:17:38.157 --> 01:17:40.659
Good work, Ponton. We're in.

01:17:42.369 --> 01:17:44.163
Look!

01:17:45.039 --> 01:17:47.207
It's the killer! After him!

01:17:47.374 --> 01:17:52.338
- Change outfits.
- Stop! Turn around.

01:17:52.546 --> 01:17:53.839
Who are you?

01:17:54.006 --> 01:17:59.011
- What are you doing here?
- We are... We are two... We are...

01:17:59.219 --> 01:18:01.263
- I'll tell you exactly who we are.
- Yes.

01:18:01.430 --> 01:18:03.682
- We are...
- I've been looking for you everywhere.

01:18:03.849 --> 01:18:05.684
Where the hell have you been?

01:18:05.851 --> 01:18:08.354
- You know these two?
- Of course I know them.

01:18:08.562 --> 01:18:11.774
They are Xania's backup dancers.
They go on in the third act...

01:18:11.940 --> 01:18:14.026
with the Komodo dragon
and the snow machine.

01:18:14.193 --> 01:18:16.528
Why do you think they are
dressed like that, for fun?

01:18:16.695 --> 01:18:19.198
- Prove it.
- We don't have to prove...

01:18:56.944 --> 01:18:58.779
Can't you see these
dancers are exhausted?

01:18:58.988 --> 01:19:00.322
Go and fetch them some water.

01:19:02.574 --> 01:19:04.535
That was fantastic.

01:19:04.994 --> 01:19:06.620
- You think so?
- You are...

01:19:08.205 --> 01:19:10.749
an amazing woman.

01:19:15.170 --> 01:19:17.923
Inspector, the killer.

01:19:32.146 --> 01:19:35.482
Now I am ready to
catch a killer.

01:19:51.040 --> 01:19:52.124
Stop!

01:19:52.541 --> 01:19:54.835
Stop in the name of the law.

01:19:55.544 --> 01:19:57.004
Get him!

01:19:57.546 --> 01:19:59.840
- Bravo!
- Bravo!

01:20:02.009 --> 01:20:05.262
Ponton, you follow him that way.
I'll go this way and cut him off.

01:20:08.265 --> 01:20:09.516
Stop!

01:20:11.560 --> 01:20:13.187
Turn around.

01:20:14.229 --> 01:20:17.024
- You're under arre...
- You are under arrest!

01:20:17.191 --> 01:20:19.151
Ponton! After him!

01:20:19.485 --> 01:20:20.861
Now.

01:20:21.737 --> 01:20:22.821
Go, go!

01:20:23.197 --> 01:20:26.659
Well, Dr. Pang. In the
name of the statutes...

01:20:27.076 --> 01:20:29.536
and laws of the great
nation of France...

01:20:31.205 --> 01:20:34.875
I arrest you for the
murder of Yves Gluant.

01:20:39.672 --> 01:20:41.548
Clouseau! Arrest him.

01:20:43.258 --> 01:20:44.885
Which one is he?

01:20:45.052 --> 01:20:46.303
That would be him.

01:20:50.683 --> 01:20:54.561
In the name of the statutes and laws
of the great nation of France...

01:20:54.728 --> 01:20:56.981
I arrest you for the
murder of Yves Gluant.

01:20:57.147 --> 01:20:59.525
Yuri, the trainer who trains.

01:21:01.860 --> 01:21:03.570
And who are you?

01:21:03.737 --> 01:21:06.573
I am Inspector Jacques Clouseau.

01:21:07.449 --> 01:21:09.576
Gluant was nothing!

01:21:09.743 --> 01:21:11.370
I drew up the plays.

01:21:11.912 --> 01:21:15.416
He takes credit for brilliant
French defense which I gave him...

01:21:15.624 --> 01:21:19.753
and treats me like I'm dead. Fine.
Now he is dead from Chinese poison.

01:21:21.130 --> 01:21:24.049
Inspector, what made
you think it was him?

01:21:24.216 --> 01:21:29.430
But, Ponton, think back.
You were there.

01:21:31.015 --> 01:21:32.057
WHY DO YOU BOTHER ME?

01:21:32.266 --> 01:21:33.892
WHY DID YOU BRING ME HERE?
I'M BUSY.

01:21:35.102 --> 01:21:37.062
THE COACH WAS KILLED
WITH CHINESE POISON.

01:21:37.271 --> 01:21:38.856
YOU SHOULD LOOK FOR
SOCCER TRAINERS.

01:21:40.524 --> 01:21:44.069
THEY ARE REQUIRED TO HAVE A
KNOWLEDGE OF CHINESE HERBS.

01:21:44.778 --> 01:21:46.363
She was right, of course.

01:21:46.780 --> 01:21:50.659
According to statute 87223, every
trainer of the national soccer team...

01:21:50.826 --> 01:21:52.911
must have a knowledge
of Chinese herbs.

01:21:53.245 --> 01:21:56.957
This made it easy for
him to murder Gluant.

01:21:57.916 --> 01:22:00.419
- And Bizu?
- Simple.

01:22:00.586 --> 01:22:04.006
Bizu had often heard Yuri's
rants against Gluant.

01:22:04.173 --> 01:22:07.635
So Bizu blackmailed Yuri
and got himself killed.

01:22:08.469 --> 01:22:10.804
Oh, it's you.

01:22:13.599 --> 01:22:15.476
A stunning shot to the head...

01:22:15.976 --> 01:22:18.812
burrowing deeply into
the occipital lobe.

01:22:18.979 --> 01:22:20.689
But Yuri is a soccer trainer.

01:22:20.856 --> 01:22:23.400
That shot was made by
an expert marksman.

01:22:23.567 --> 01:22:25.486
Chief inspector, I'm
sure you're familiar...

01:22:25.694 --> 01:22:27.488
with Russian army statute 611.

01:22:28.197 --> 01:22:29.448
Well, of course.

01:22:29.615 --> 01:22:31.742
All members must be...

01:22:31.909 --> 01:22:33.952
expert marksmen...
- Expert marksmen.

01:22:34.119 --> 01:22:37.665
And understand the location
of the occipital...

01:22:37.831 --> 01:22:40.000
- Occipital lobe, of course.
- Yes.

01:22:40.209 --> 01:22:43.170
- Very true.
- Yes, Yuri.

01:22:43.337 --> 01:22:45.506
Xania is still alive.

01:22:45.673 --> 01:22:49.593
But you hated her. And that's
why you are trying to kill her.

01:22:49.760 --> 01:22:52.638
You hated her because she went
with Bizu and then Gluant...

01:22:52.805 --> 01:22:54.848
and treated you like
you were nothing.

01:22:55.265 --> 01:22:59.061
But you forgot a fundamental
truth about women.

01:22:59.228 --> 01:23:01.689
A woman is like a...

01:23:01.855 --> 01:23:03.816
Is like a...

01:23:03.983 --> 01:23:05.359
artichoke.

01:23:06.527 --> 01:23:10.322
You have to do a bit of work
before you get to her heart.

01:23:12.199 --> 01:23:15.160
What about the diamond? What
about the Pink Panther?

01:23:15.327 --> 01:23:20.124
Yes, thank you, Inspector Clouseau
for carrying out my orders.

01:23:20.290 --> 01:23:21.834
Hand over the diamond, Yuri.

01:23:22.042 --> 01:23:24.211
What do I care about
your stinking diamond?

01:23:24.670 --> 01:23:26.046
He does not have the diamond.

01:23:26.255 --> 01:23:28.757
The murderer does not
have the diamond?

01:23:28.924 --> 01:23:31.302
- No.
- Well, then, where is it...

01:23:31.468 --> 01:23:33.053
Inspector Clouseau?

01:23:33.262 --> 01:23:36.181
It is there! In her purse.

01:23:37.558 --> 01:23:38.934
Let me see.

01:23:51.071 --> 01:23:53.824
Sorry, Clouseau, no diamond.

01:24:02.124 --> 01:24:04.293
The purse, please.

01:24:10.174 --> 01:24:11.842
Could you hold that, please?

01:24:23.354 --> 01:24:26.899
After Gluant came to me, he said
he decided to stop cheating on me.

01:24:27.858 --> 01:24:30.027
Then he asked me to marry him...

01:24:32.154 --> 01:24:34.490
and put the ring in my hands.

01:24:36.950 --> 01:24:38.869
After he was killed,
I thought...

01:24:39.036 --> 01:24:41.955
if I came forward with the ring,
everyone would think I did it.

01:24:42.122 --> 01:24:44.667
If Gluant gave you the
ring before he died...

01:24:44.833 --> 01:24:50.965
then according to civil statute
812-914B, you are the rightful owner.

01:24:51.131 --> 01:24:53.759
You may keep the Pink Panther.

01:24:59.139 --> 01:25:01.558
But, inspector, how did
you know she had it?

01:25:01.725 --> 01:25:03.227
It was simple, Ponton.

01:25:03.394 --> 01:25:06.605
I was looking at a photo of
myself at the checkpoint.

01:25:06.772 --> 01:25:08.565
Something caught my eye:

01:25:08.732 --> 01:25:11.986
Xania's purse passing
through the x-ray machine.

01:25:12.486 --> 01:25:14.947
I enlarged the photo...

01:25:15.155 --> 01:25:16.615
and in it...

01:25:17.658 --> 01:25:18.909
the Pink Panther.

01:25:19.076 --> 01:25:22.788
- The case is closed!
- Bravo, Clouseau.

01:25:28.544 --> 01:25:30.337
Bravo!

01:25:31.880 --> 01:25:35.175
Clouseau! Clouseau! Clouseau!
Clouseau!

01:25:39.657 --> 01:25:40.657
Chief inspector...

01:25:40.681 --> 01:25:42.450
I can't thank you
enough for giving me...

01:25:42.474 --> 01:25:44.394
the opportunity to solve
the Pink Panther murder.

01:25:44.435 --> 01:25:46.437
Without your decision to
put me on the case...

01:25:46.603 --> 01:25:49.773
who knows, someone else might've
won the Medal of Honor this year.

01:25:49.940 --> 01:25:51.191
Yes, I know.

01:25:51.358 --> 01:25:55.654
I owe it all to you, chief inspector.
Without you, I would be nothing.

01:25:55.821 --> 01:25:59.658
- Perhaps you still are.
- Excellent verbal joust, inspector.

01:25:59.825 --> 01:26:02.036
You idiot! Oh, no.

01:26:02.202 --> 01:26:04.830
- Hit it, Ponton.
- No! Clouseau!

01:26:04.997 --> 01:26:06.623
Stop the car. Dear...

01:26:06.790 --> 01:26:08.417
What?

01:26:08.584 --> 01:26:10.169
Nothing.

01:26:10.669 --> 01:26:11.879
You didn't say:

01:26:12.046 --> 01:26:16.508
"Stop the car. Dear God, I
beg of you, stop the car"?

01:26:16.717 --> 01:26:18.260
No.

01:26:26.935 --> 01:26:28.896
Does it hurt?

01:26:34.318 --> 01:26:35.694
What?

01:26:37.237 --> 01:26:38.906
I can't understand you.

01:26:43.452 --> 01:26:45.913
You know what, I think
he wants to recline.

01:26:46.080 --> 01:26:47.998
There's a lever right here.

01:26:48.165 --> 01:26:50.250
Oh, it's on the other
side, I'm sorry.

01:26:50.417 --> 01:26:53.253
A bit of a reach. Wait a minute.
I'll get it.

01:26:53.420 --> 01:26:55.381
I'll get it right here.

01:26:55.631 --> 01:26:58.550
Is right back here.

01:27:01.220 --> 01:27:03.013
There must be a simpler way...

01:27:03.180 --> 01:27:06.183
of working this... Oh,
there's a remote control...

01:27:06.350 --> 01:27:07.434
so that you can just...

01:27:07.643 --> 01:27:10.479
It's sensitive! I hardly touched it!
But it goes up...

01:27:14.900 --> 01:27:16.527
That's it! That's it!

01:27:20.656 --> 01:27:24.243
- You know, Ponton.
- Yes, inspector.

01:27:25.077 --> 01:27:27.997
This is a very hard time
for Inspector Dreyfus.

01:27:28.163 --> 01:27:31.542
It is important that
we show compassion.

01:27:31.709 --> 01:27:34.962
And we must use the gentle
healing power of laughter.

01:27:57.109 --> 01:27:58.902
This is going to hurt.

01:28:01.322 --> 01:28:04.074
Clouseau!

01:28:07.703 --> 01:28:10.039
That breeze feels good.
