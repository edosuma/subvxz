WEBVTT

00:51.491 --> 00:53.406
Three, two, one.

00:54.320 --> 00:55.973
And...

00:55.973 --> 00:56.800
We're live.

00:59.803 --> 01:00.935
How you doin', Victor?

01:00.935 --> 01:01.762
I'm doing great.

01:01.762 --> 01:03.242
Thanks for askin'.

01:03.242 --> 01:05.113
Okay, so just for the
audience not familiar with you,

01:05.113 --> 01:06.549
briefly introduce yourself,

01:06.549 --> 01:10.684
and what you did for the
infamous Vance Institute.

01:10.684 --> 01:11.989
I was an ex-con

01:12.903 --> 01:14.514
who got a second chance at life

01:14.514 --> 01:18.431
when I came across one of
Tobin Vance's self-help books.

01:18.431 --> 01:20.172
And when I was done doing my time,

01:20.172 --> 01:22.565
I became a nurse and nutritionist,

01:22.565 --> 01:24.654
and started working at the institute.

01:24.654 --> 01:26.047
Now, that's interesting.

01:26.047 --> 01:30.051
You still credit Tobin
Vance for saving your life,

01:30.051 --> 01:32.706
even after all the things
he's been accused of?

01:32.706 --> 01:37.102
You can't discount
his earlier accomplishments

01:37.102 --> 01:39.539
just because things went south
later on.

01:43.369 --> 01:44.239
Results.

01:45.719 --> 01:46.763
That's what I'm talking about.

01:46.763 --> 01:48.417
In fact, that's all I preach.

01:49.375 --> 01:51.377
If I told you I could
save your dying child,

01:51.377 --> 01:52.552
would you care how I did it?

01:52.552 --> 01:54.119
No!

01:54.119 --> 01:58.210
You'd only be concerned with the results.

01:58.210 --> 02:02.127
If I told you I could erase
all your fears, insecurities,

02:02.127 --> 02:03.998
and personal issues,

02:03.998 --> 02:06.261
would ya care how I did it?

02:06.261 --> 02:07.132
No.

02:08.089 --> 02:10.091
You'd only be concerned about
one thing.

02:11.048 --> 02:12.615
The results.

02:12.615 --> 02:15.314
Him, what's his file say?

02:15.314 --> 02:16.837
That's Daniel White.

02:16.837 --> 02:19.709
His parents died in a
fire when he was a child.

02:19.709 --> 02:22.364
Has suicidal thoughts and tendencies.

02:22.364 --> 02:23.583
Alcoholic.

02:23.583 --> 02:26.412
Completed all of the Vance
online courses.

02:26.412 --> 02:27.543
Put him on the list.

02:28.457 --> 02:29.632
No.

02:29.632 --> 02:32.113
Suicidal tendencies are too unpredictable.

02:32.113 --> 02:34.420
Tobin says, "They make the
best members if they pass,

02:34.420 --> 02:36.248
and if they don't, they
got what they wanted".

02:36.248 --> 02:37.597
Win/win.

02:37.597 --> 02:39.207
Need I remind you

02:39.207 --> 02:41.949
that you're only supposed to
play your part and shadow me?

02:41.949 --> 02:43.298
They missed the big picture.

02:43.298 --> 02:44.125
It's almost like looking at

02:44.125 --> 02:45.170
the cracks of the statue,

02:45.170 --> 02:46.867
instead of the art itself.
- Hmm.

02:46.867 --> 02:48.869
Okay, put him on the list.

02:50.262 --> 02:51.698
But if anything happens,

02:53.352 --> 02:55.832
you have to repeat that
statement to Tobin.

02:55.832 --> 02:56.703
Copy that.

02:59.009 --> 03:00.620
So you need to ask yourself,

03:02.404 --> 03:05.668
what would it mean to you
to get everything you want

03:05.668 --> 03:06.626
in this world?

03:08.715 --> 03:10.717
And that answer,

03:10.717 --> 03:13.154
it better be amazing.

03:15.722 --> 03:17.550
Let's back it up, okay?

03:17.550 --> 03:20.683
Tobin Vance, for the past 20 years,

03:20.683 --> 03:25.471
has been one of the leading
self-help gurus in...

03:25.471 --> 03:26.907
The US?

03:26.907 --> 03:29.431
- In the world.
- The world.

03:29.431 --> 03:33.522
Over 20,000 people
signed up for his course,

03:33.522 --> 03:38.223
and he has ardent, dedicated
followers, like yourself?

03:38.223 --> 03:39.049
That's right.

03:39.049 --> 03:40.964
It all came

03:40.964 --> 03:44.141
crashing down!

03:44.141 --> 03:48.537
Racketeering, sexual
abuse, money laundering.

03:48.537 --> 03:49.930
Many of the victims,

03:49.930 --> 03:53.150
or survivors, as they
prefer to be referred to,

03:53.150 --> 03:55.327
say that they were manipulated,

03:55.327 --> 03:59.026
that what started out as a
self-help

03:59.026 --> 04:00.245
and leadership seminar

04:01.202 --> 04:02.986
became a cult.

04:04.684 --> 04:06.207
Hello.

04:06.207 --> 04:08.122
I am Dr. Elizabeth White,

04:09.166 --> 04:11.473
and I'm here to say, congratulations.

04:12.779 --> 04:13.954
You've all been chosen.

04:16.261 --> 04:17.131
For what?

04:18.001 --> 04:21.440
The Vance Institute Advanced
Treatment Program, John.

04:22.876 --> 04:24.486
This is a five day retreat,

04:24.486 --> 04:28.011
where you will be guaranteed results.

04:28.011 --> 04:30.231
You all have contracts,

04:30.231 --> 04:32.189
and I'd like you to review the details.

04:32.189 --> 04:33.930
So this is some kind of

04:35.541 --> 04:37.194
advanced training?

04:37.194 --> 04:38.457
Mm-hmm.

04:38.457 --> 04:39.327
It's happening.

04:39.327 --> 04:40.676
It's actually happening!

04:40.676 --> 04:41.808
Yes, Frank.

04:43.026 --> 04:45.246
And you are all followers of
Tobin Vance

04:45.246 --> 04:47.770
and the Vance Institute Training Program,

04:47.770 --> 04:49.903
and we feel that you have the potential

04:49.903 --> 04:52.384
to be active contributing members.

04:52.384 --> 04:53.994
You filled
out a form

04:53.994 --> 04:55.038
when you came here today,

04:55.038 --> 04:57.302
and we feel we can help you.

04:58.477 --> 04:59.913
How?

04:59.913 --> 05:01.697
You are all invited

05:01.697 --> 05:06.311
to the Vance Institute Advanced
Treatment Retreat Center

05:06.311 --> 05:07.442
in Kirkcaldy, Scotland.

05:07.442 --> 05:08.704
Wow!

05:08.704 --> 05:10.706
It's definitely something to
say wow to.

05:10.706 --> 05:13.230
But we are also hoping
that you'll say yes to it.

05:13.230 --> 05:14.319
Please review the contracts.

05:14.319 --> 05:15.755
We want to make sure that you are

05:15.755 --> 05:18.105
freely entering into
this agreement with us.

05:20.673 --> 05:21.500
Yes, John?

05:23.371 --> 05:26.592
It says this is $75,000.

05:28.898 --> 05:33.642
Yes, but here's the good news.

05:33.642 --> 05:34.904
That fee is waived.

05:35.992 --> 05:39.126
You'll only be charged that
amount if you decide to quit.

05:39.126 --> 05:41.041
I don't know if I'm
ready for this program.

05:41.041 --> 05:42.521
You're not sure?

05:42.521 --> 05:45.306
A five day retreat in
the middle of the woods?

05:45.306 --> 05:46.394
I mean, I just don't know

05:46.394 --> 05:47.308
if I'm ready.
- Are you not ready

05:47.308 --> 05:48.265
to get over your problems, John?

05:48.265 --> 05:49.832
I mean, I'd love that.

05:49.832 --> 05:50.659
I'd love that.

05:50.659 --> 05:51.530
But-
- But...

05:52.444 --> 05:54.750
But is the killer word, John.

05:56.273 --> 05:58.711
I'm inclined to agree with you, John.

06:00.974 --> 06:02.454
You're not ready.

06:02.454 --> 06:06.109
That means Tobin does not
want you in the program.

06:07.459 --> 06:08.285
Wait.

06:09.156 --> 06:10.418
Would-
- Good luck, John,

06:10.418 --> 06:13.595
with your life, and your issues.

06:13.595 --> 06:14.466
Fuck!

06:16.468 --> 06:17.599
Well...

06:22.735 --> 06:23.736
The door is there.

06:30.090 --> 06:32.179
Anyone else?

06:32.179 --> 06:33.528
Great!

06:33.528 --> 06:36.401
Now we have a group ready for change.

07:00.642 --> 07:01.861
Welcome.

07:01.861 --> 07:03.819
Welcome, welcome.

07:03.819 --> 07:05.691
I hope you're all as excited to
be here

07:05.691 --> 07:06.996
as we are to have you?

07:08.128 --> 07:10.130
Please, please, form a
half-circle around the fire

07:10.130 --> 07:11.305
and we can get started.

07:12.654 --> 07:14.482
It's freezing.

07:14.482 --> 07:16.484
That's not an accident, Lily.

07:16.484 --> 07:21.184
It's freezing because life
is cold, harsh, unforgiving.

07:21.184 --> 07:22.534
Comfort!

07:22.534 --> 07:24.666
Comfort breeds weak mammals,

07:24.666 --> 07:26.494
and we're all mammals, are we
not?

07:27.669 --> 07:30.280
Struggles in life could make us stronger

07:30.280 --> 07:31.760
or they could crush us,

07:31.760 --> 07:32.761
but not us,

07:32.761 --> 07:35.677
because we are about to evolve.

07:35.677 --> 07:38.985
We're about to shed the husk of
the weak,

07:38.985 --> 07:41.466
the impulsive, the
mournful, the deceitful.

07:41.466 --> 07:43.032
Say yes to this!

07:43.032 --> 07:43.903
Yes.

07:44.773 --> 07:47.254
Now, before you were invited here,

07:47.254 --> 07:48.516
you were given a request

07:48.516 --> 07:50.562
to bring an item of extreme importance.

07:50.562 --> 07:53.434
Now, this personal object
should have significant meaning.

07:53.434 --> 07:55.784
It should be a representation

07:55.784 --> 07:59.048
of the life that you want to
leave behind.

07:59.048 --> 08:01.355
If you'll all pull out
these objects, please?

08:05.968 --> 08:08.449
When a lobster gets too big for
its shell,

08:08.449 --> 08:09.494
it breaks free,

08:10.495 --> 08:11.408
and then it's weak.

08:11.408 --> 08:13.193
It's vulnerable, it's raw,

08:13.193 --> 08:16.544
and it needs to build a
thicker, stronger shell.

08:16.544 --> 08:18.285
We, here, now!

08:18.285 --> 08:21.506
We are shedding our shells.

08:21.506 --> 08:24.291
Now, we'll go around one by one,

08:24.291 --> 08:27.642
and you can explain your
object and its significance.

08:29.470 --> 08:30.297
Jesse.

08:32.908 --> 08:35.607
My parents sent me
off to boarding school,

08:35.607 --> 08:37.913
but I didn't quite fit in with
the others.

08:39.524 --> 08:42.309
The headmaster noticed that
I had an eye for detail,

08:43.484 --> 08:45.181
and said I might enjoy reading about

08:45.181 --> 08:47.575
the greatest detective there
ever was.

08:49.098 --> 08:51.797
To this day, never been without
a copy.

08:52.798 --> 08:55.452
Sometimes people focus
too much on the details

08:55.452 --> 08:56.845
and they miss the big picture.

08:56.845 --> 08:58.455
It's almost like looking
at the cracks in a statue,

08:58.455 --> 08:59.761
instead of the art itself.

09:01.328 --> 09:02.155
Nicole.

09:03.852 --> 09:07.682
My father gave me this
doll for my birthday

09:09.858 --> 09:11.599
the year before my mother shot him.

09:13.688 --> 09:16.343
It was all I had left of who he was

09:16.343 --> 09:17.649
- before he-
- Before

09:18.650 --> 09:19.868
your mother went to jail

09:19.868 --> 09:21.957
and you became ward of
the state at 13, right?

09:23.219 --> 09:24.873
Right.

09:24.873 --> 09:28.616
So that doll represents
someone who is never really there.

09:28.616 --> 09:30.618
These people were predators,

09:30.618 --> 09:32.881
and you defended the
sheep's cloak they wore.

09:34.840 --> 09:35.710
Lily.

09:40.410 --> 09:41.498
When I was little,

09:42.804 --> 09:45.154
our house was filled
with photos of my mother.

09:46.025 --> 09:47.809
I look at this photo,

09:47.809 --> 09:49.768
think that my mom was a princess.

09:51.291 --> 09:53.249
She died of cancer when I was 14.

09:56.165 --> 09:59.386
Your mother was Feria Lee?

09:59.386 --> 10:00.692
Yes.

10:00.692 --> 10:04.391
Okay, from 1980, she started modeling,

10:04.391 --> 10:07.046
and did her last runway in 1986.

10:07.046 --> 10:11.224
Then from '86 to '92, she
raised you, wrote two books,

10:11.224 --> 10:12.747
trained show dogs,

10:12.747 --> 10:14.836
and increased funding and
research for breast cancer,

10:14.836 --> 10:17.360
and yet, the image you hold onto

10:17.360 --> 10:19.449
is something that existed for
six years.

10:20.799 --> 10:23.366
If I asked your mother what her
greatest accomplishment was,

10:23.366 --> 10:25.325
do you think she'd say
her modeling career?

10:26.935 --> 10:28.284
Frank.

10:30.286 --> 10:33.202
This is a game token
from Time Warp Arcade.

10:34.290 --> 10:35.117
Go on.

10:35.988 --> 10:37.511
Was.

10:37.511 --> 10:40.340
It's an arcade token I've kept
with me since I was a kid.

10:40.340 --> 10:42.429
You liked arcade games?

10:42.429 --> 10:43.691
I was obsessed, yeah.

10:45.693 --> 10:48.261
You told us you lost your
brother in a car accident

10:48.261 --> 10:49.697
when you were 11, right?

10:49.697 --> 10:51.307
Yeah.

10:51.307 --> 10:55.094
And where were you going when
the car got in the accident?

10:56.922 --> 10:58.053
Time Warp Arcade.

11:00.099 --> 11:01.361
Who was driving?

11:04.233 --> 11:05.060
My dad.

11:06.540 --> 11:08.107
You get along with your
father?

11:09.848 --> 11:10.675
He hates me.

11:11.850 --> 11:13.765
After that day, did he hit you
ever?

11:16.768 --> 11:17.594
All the time.

11:18.987 --> 11:20.032
Hmm.

11:20.032 --> 11:21.903
You think you deserved it?

11:21.903 --> 11:22.774
Well, I did, yeah.

11:25.385 --> 11:27.430
I was the shit brother.

11:27.430 --> 11:29.171
Frank, look at me!

11:29.171 --> 11:31.434
Your father was driving.

11:31.434 --> 11:32.827
You blame yourself.

11:32.827 --> 11:35.177
You play that victim card.

11:35.177 --> 11:37.745
But your father was too weak of
a person

11:37.745 --> 11:39.138
to admit that it was his fault,

11:39.138 --> 11:40.487
and he blamed you,

11:40.487 --> 11:42.054
so you carry the weight of that blame.

11:42.054 --> 11:43.882
You carry the weight of that token,

11:43.882 --> 11:45.448
and it's weighing you down.

11:45.448 --> 11:49.714
You haven't even begun to become
the man that you could be.

11:51.019 --> 11:51.846
Daniel.

11:56.938 --> 11:58.592
I see where this is going.

11:59.898 --> 12:00.725
Okay.

12:04.250 --> 12:05.730
This was my dad's...

12:09.124 --> 12:11.213
My dad's favorite bourbon.

12:11.213 --> 12:12.737
And what happened to your
father?

12:13.912 --> 12:15.565
You know all about us.

12:15.565 --> 12:17.045
That seems-
- What happened?

12:19.744 --> 12:21.093
He committed suicide.

12:23.617 --> 12:24.444
You miss him?

12:25.575 --> 12:26.446
Every day.

12:27.664 --> 12:29.971
He blamed you for ruining
his life, didn't he?

12:32.147 --> 12:32.974
Yeah.

12:34.019 --> 12:37.500
Your father placed an
enormous burden on you to carry.

12:37.500 --> 12:39.154
You drink to feel numb.

12:40.460 --> 12:43.680
Folks, I want you all to
destroy these objects.

12:43.680 --> 12:45.421
Place them right in the fire,

12:45.421 --> 12:47.597
because these objects are
holding us back

12:47.597 --> 12:52.254
from becoming the people
that we were meant to be.

12:56.824 --> 12:58.434
Fuck it!

13:13.101 --> 13:13.972
Hand it to me, Daniel.

13:13.972 --> 13:14.842
I'll throw it in for you.

13:14.842 --> 13:16.539
Don't, Frank!

13:16.539 --> 13:18.193
That's Daniel's past to discard.

13:20.892 --> 13:22.545
He doesn't look so good.

13:22.545 --> 13:25.287
Frank has
his own demons to face.

13:25.287 --> 13:26.898
You're all free to throw on a blanket,

13:26.898 --> 13:29.683
and Elizabeth will lead you
back to the retreat house.

13:40.825 --> 13:41.913
What's wrong, Daniel?

13:44.002 --> 13:44.872
Don't like fire.

13:45.830 --> 13:46.831
Daniel, look at me.

13:49.224 --> 13:50.051
Look at me!

13:51.487 --> 13:53.402
You could stay where you are.

13:53.402 --> 13:54.751
You can live in the past,

13:54.751 --> 13:56.884
or you could face your fears,

13:56.884 --> 13:59.278
and become the person
that you were meant to be.

14:02.498 --> 14:04.109
I can't.

14:07.808 --> 14:10.115
The retreat is about a
quarter mile from here.

14:10.115 --> 14:11.681
You can walk there yourself,

14:11.681 --> 14:13.770
and one of my associates will
get your

14:13.770 --> 14:16.382
fucking worthless ass off my property,

14:16.382 --> 14:18.253
you weak fuck!

14:18.253 --> 14:19.907
And then we'll send you the bill.

15:26.278 --> 15:27.496
Your phones.

15:28.410 --> 15:31.196
Having no contact with the
outside world

15:31.196 --> 15:33.198
will be essential for your growth.

15:35.504 --> 15:38.246
You'll be returned your phones
by the end of the retreat.

15:40.466 --> 15:41.380
Yes, Jesse?

15:42.207 --> 15:43.425
What's with the rooms?

15:45.036 --> 15:46.559
I'm not sure what that means?

15:48.039 --> 15:51.172
The walls in the rooms,
they're reinforced.

15:52.260 --> 15:54.306
You're planning to lock us in?

15:54.306 --> 15:56.656
God, no!

15:57.570 --> 15:58.963
You can try the locks yourselves.

15:58.963 --> 16:01.226
There's no way to lock
them from the outside.

16:02.140 --> 16:04.664
But they are soundproof.

16:05.839 --> 16:07.319
Why is that?

16:07.319 --> 16:08.624
In the past,

16:08.624 --> 16:10.757
different people have
reacted in varying ways

16:10.757 --> 16:11.627
to the treatment.

16:12.889 --> 16:15.196
Some yell and scream,

16:15.196 --> 16:17.720
some laugh, some talk to themselves.

16:17.720 --> 16:20.419
Either way, that is your own journey,

16:20.419 --> 16:22.334
and not one to be heard by the others.

16:25.685 --> 16:27.295
So when does all this start?

16:28.253 --> 16:29.994
First thing in the morning.

16:31.604 --> 16:35.695
And now, I have good news,

16:35.695 --> 16:37.044
and then, even better news.

16:45.574 --> 16:46.967
Each day, you will be required

16:46.967 --> 16:50.927
to take these mental
enhancers and vitamins.

16:50.927 --> 16:54.279
They will help you to truly
feel the effects of the changes

16:54.279 --> 16:56.063
you're so ready to make.

16:59.110 --> 17:01.503
You need to trust us, if you
want results.

17:04.419 --> 17:05.725
What's the bad news?

17:07.553 --> 17:10.773
Yeah, you said there
was even more good news?

17:10.773 --> 17:12.906
Oh, [laughs] yes.

17:14.777 --> 17:17.954
Tonight, you get to have fun.

17:17.954 --> 17:21.045
Introduce yourselves, share stories.

17:21.045 --> 17:23.308
I want you to truly
get to know each other.

17:25.049 --> 17:27.442
Tomorrow, your new life begins.

17:28.574 --> 17:30.793
Hey, where's Daniel?

17:37.931 --> 17:39.237
He wanted to be with his family

17:39.237 --> 17:42.283
more than he wanted to
grow into a new human.

17:42.283 --> 17:43.154
But don't worry.

17:44.981 --> 17:46.592
Those who fail

17:46.592 --> 17:49.029
end up paying for those
whose fees we've waived.

18:04.131 --> 18:05.393
My name is Nicole,

18:05.393 --> 18:08.353
and I'm here to get over some insecurities

18:08.353 --> 18:11.617
and trust issues I've had
stemming from my younger years.

18:12.966 --> 18:14.315
My name is Frank,

18:14.315 --> 18:17.971
and I'm here because I
can't stand up for myself.

18:19.103 --> 18:21.409
I'm Lily, and I'd like to

18:21.409 --> 18:23.890
work on a eating disorder that
I've had.

18:24.804 --> 18:26.066
Jesus Christ!

18:26.762 --> 18:27.546
What?

18:27.546 --> 18:28.808
My name's Jesse,

18:28.808 --> 18:30.375
and unlike you three,

18:30.375 --> 18:32.159
I'll actually have the balls
to tell you my real problem.

18:32.159 --> 18:33.508
Hey!

18:33.508 --> 18:34.422
None of you would've come here

18:34.422 --> 18:36.163
if you had these minor issues.

18:40.776 --> 18:42.169
Trust issues?

18:42.169 --> 18:43.562
Go see a shrink.

18:43.562 --> 18:45.825
And you, buy a book on personal power.

18:47.174 --> 18:48.349
Hang on.

18:48.349 --> 18:50.525
Don't assume you know anything
about us.

18:50.525 --> 18:51.439
That's just it.

18:52.440 --> 18:54.181
We're supposed to get to know
each other.

18:54.181 --> 18:55.226
Truly get to know each other.

18:55.226 --> 18:56.836
That's what Elizabeth said.

18:58.229 --> 19:01.884
So Nicole, wanna tell us
why you're really here?

19:06.498 --> 19:08.500
I was raped by my father.

19:13.200 --> 19:14.070
I...

19:15.071 --> 19:15.855
I didn't...

19:15.855 --> 19:17.378
I'm sorry.

19:17.378 --> 19:20.425
There was a time where I
couldn't even say that out loud.

19:22.296 --> 19:24.037
But as much as you seem
like an asshole, Jesse,

19:24.037 --> 19:25.256
you're absolutely right,

19:26.387 --> 19:27.519
I'm here to change.

19:30.478 --> 19:32.263
And Elizabeth told us
to share our stories.

19:32.263 --> 19:33.177
So...

19:34.439 --> 19:35.353
What's your story?

19:42.838 --> 19:45.972
I'm here for anxiety and depression.

19:47.669 --> 19:49.018
It may not sound like much,

19:50.324 --> 19:52.935
but

19:52.935 --> 19:55.199
sometimes I can't leave
the house because of it.

19:56.374 --> 19:58.463
I get in a funk, and I
can't get over of it.

19:59.681 --> 20:02.815
My eating disorder is bigger
than just a normal issue.

20:04.904 --> 20:06.688
I can't stop myself.

20:10.301 --> 20:12.520
Well, I've been bullied my
whole life.

20:13.565 --> 20:14.957
When I was 12,

20:14.957 --> 20:17.177
a bully beat me up in
front of the entire school,

20:18.439 --> 20:20.267
and I peed my pants when it happened.

20:22.138 --> 20:24.532
After that, I was known
as Frank the Urinator

20:24.532 --> 20:26.273
for the rest of school.

20:30.930 --> 20:32.714
Go ahead and laugh, guys.

20:32.714 --> 20:33.889
I mean, we are meant to be

20:33.889 --> 20:35.674
gettin' to know each other,
after all.

20:35.674 --> 20:37.502
And besides,

20:37.502 --> 20:39.634
I think this booze is startin'
to kick in.

21:16.410 --> 21:19.326
- Everybody okay?

21:20.458 --> 21:22.808
- What the hell is that?

21:22.808 --> 21:25.898
I'm assuming it's a sign to
tell us it's time to go to bed.

21:25.898 --> 21:28.030
No.

21:33.993 --> 21:36.517
Alcohol.

21:36.517 --> 21:39.041
Is this alcohol affecting you?

21:39.041 --> 21:41.740
Yeah.

21:42.741 --> 21:44.395
Am I dreaming this?

22:58.382 --> 23:00.601
Day one, the
followers were given

23:00.601 --> 23:03.430
some kind of drunk cocktail,

23:03.430 --> 23:05.301
which appeared to knock them out.

23:06.868 --> 23:09.436
It was potentially causing hallucinations.

26:11.357 --> 26:13.141
How did you know she'd kill him,

26:14.055 --> 26:15.491
and not the other way around?

26:16.797 --> 26:17.668
We didn't.

26:18.756 --> 26:19.931
So where is Tobin?

26:19.931 --> 26:21.236
Where is he?

26:21.236 --> 26:22.281
Come on, man.

26:22.281 --> 26:24.152
I don't know where he's at.

26:24.152 --> 26:25.763
Oh, come on, man!

26:25.763 --> 26:27.329
Stop bullshitting me.

26:27.329 --> 26:28.504
You know where he is.

26:28.504 --> 26:29.723
Come on, admit it.

26:29.723 --> 26:31.507
He's still running the Vance Institutes.

26:31.507 --> 26:32.726
He's still running this shit,
but from...

26:32.726 --> 26:33.640
He's hiding.

26:33.640 --> 26:34.467
He's in hiding.

26:34.467 --> 26:35.294
But where?

26:36.208 --> 26:38.123
There's reports he's in the UK.

26:38.123 --> 26:39.733
Yeah, in the UK,

26:39.733 --> 26:42.170
And he's still selling this
bullshit as wellness retreats.

26:43.171 --> 26:44.651
That's the reports.

26:44.651 --> 26:46.435
I don't know shit, man.

27:29.391 --> 27:30.871
Good mornin'.

27:31.916 --> 27:33.004
Sleep well?

27:34.527 --> 27:35.833
Yeah.

27:35.833 --> 27:36.921
You?

27:36.921 --> 27:38.400
I passed out.

27:38.400 --> 27:39.401
I did, too.

27:39.401 --> 27:40.707
I know, Frank.

27:40.707 --> 27:42.491
I dragged you to your room.

27:42.491 --> 27:43.928
You seem fine, Jesse?

27:43.928 --> 27:46.017
Yeah, I was hiding it well.

27:46.974 --> 27:50.325
Well, if no one's gonna
come out and say it, I will.

27:51.762 --> 27:52.632
Did they drug us?

27:53.764 --> 27:56.680
We took those pills on their orders.

27:57.637 --> 27:59.683
Maybe mixing them with alcohol
did it?

28:10.737 --> 28:11.999
Good morning.

28:14.262 --> 28:16.003
First light was a little rough, eh?

28:17.091 --> 28:19.093
Maybe you needed to let off some
steam?

28:19.964 --> 28:21.269
That's what you call it?

28:22.836 --> 28:25.839
Did y'all get a
little crazy?

28:25.839 --> 28:28.842
Maybe it was the drugs, Tobin?

28:28.842 --> 28:30.888
Oh, yes, the vitamins we gave you.

28:31.889 --> 28:34.108
Don't worry, they still did
their job.

28:35.588 --> 28:37.111
What the hell does that mean?

28:37.938 --> 28:39.026
The vitamins,

28:40.201 --> 28:42.900
they sometimes have a reaction

28:42.900 --> 28:44.597
with extreme levels of alcohol.

28:45.511 --> 28:46.599
Maybe we should have warned you?

28:46.599 --> 28:48.644
But you are all adults.

28:49.776 --> 28:51.822
I mean, Jesse here, he looks fine.

28:51.822 --> 28:56.478
Well, I've been able to
handle alcohol my whole life.

28:56.478 --> 28:58.176
My family are all big drinkers.

28:59.220 --> 29:00.047
Got it.

29:02.267 --> 29:03.355
How 'bout you, Nicole?

29:06.184 --> 29:07.315
What?

29:07.315 --> 29:12.233
I mean, did you have
hallucinations?

29:12.233 --> 29:13.060
No.

29:13.060 --> 29:14.975
No, just a head rush.

29:16.411 --> 29:19.110
You see?

29:19.110 --> 29:20.589
I mean, y'all look tired,

29:20.589 --> 29:23.679
but do any of you have the
classic hangover symptoms,

29:23.679 --> 29:25.072
headache, shaking hands?

29:25.943 --> 29:26.770
You see?

29:26.770 --> 29:28.554
The vitamins do work!

29:29.816 --> 29:31.383
Folks, we know all about you.

29:31.383 --> 29:34.038
We know your fears, your
weaknesses, your issues,

29:34.038 --> 29:36.823
your hopes, your dreams.

29:36.823 --> 29:39.739
Elizabeth here has your applications.

29:39.739 --> 29:41.219
And from now on,

29:41.219 --> 29:45.614
the rest of this retreat
will be focused on results.

29:45.614 --> 29:48.530
That's a word I love to use lately.

29:48.530 --> 29:50.968
So last night, y'all needed
to let off some steam.

29:50.968 --> 29:52.317
It's fine!

29:52.317 --> 29:55.842
But now, we have to
start with a clean slate.

29:55.842 --> 29:57.235
The question becomes,

29:57.235 --> 30:01.152
how do we clean that slate
quickly?

30:03.763 --> 30:06.853
And what, are these gonna do
this?

30:06.853 --> 30:08.507
They'll help you focus.

30:08.507 --> 30:09.725
Take them.

30:12.467 --> 30:13.642
You do what I say!

30:16.863 --> 30:18.734
Who's ready to focus?

30:18.734 --> 30:20.345
Now, how did you all feel
when I yelled that way?

30:20.345 --> 30:21.955
That was scary, right?

30:21.955 --> 30:23.565
You reacted.

30:23.565 --> 30:27.134
When you're upset, when you're
angry, depressed, any of it,

30:27.134 --> 30:28.440
that's all you can focus on.

30:28.440 --> 30:29.789
Wouldn't you agree?

30:29.789 --> 30:30.877
Let's say this.

30:30.877 --> 30:32.052
Say you're driving down the road,

30:32.052 --> 30:33.488
and you're living with those emotions.

30:33.488 --> 30:35.664
You're angry, depressed,
sad, something like that,

30:35.664 --> 30:37.492
and a deer runs out,

30:37.492 --> 30:39.886
and runs right into your car.

30:39.886 --> 30:41.148
What happens?

30:41.148 --> 30:42.671
You react.

30:42.671 --> 30:43.977
The adrenaline kicks in.

30:44.848 --> 30:45.936
Exactly.

30:45.936 --> 30:46.806
Good.

30:46.806 --> 30:47.851
Good job, both of you.

30:48.808 --> 30:50.505
Let me ask another question.

30:51.898 --> 30:54.509
When you're dealing with that situation,

30:54.509 --> 30:59.210
what happens to your
anger, your depression,

30:59.210 --> 31:00.864
and your sadness?

31:02.039 --> 31:03.301
They disappear.

31:03.301 --> 31:04.171
Bingo!

31:04.171 --> 31:05.259
Good.

31:05.259 --> 31:06.695
Nicole, good.

31:06.695 --> 31:10.395
All you can focus on in
that moment is the reaction.

31:15.400 --> 31:18.882
Have any of you heard of the
Schmidt's sting pain index?

31:20.361 --> 31:22.102
It's a measure of the amount of pain

31:22.102 --> 31:24.452
given off by an insect bite or sting.

31:25.497 --> 31:27.760
Level one is your basic bee sting,

31:27.760 --> 31:30.545
and it goes all the way up to
level five.

31:30.545 --> 31:33.853
Level five is shared by three creatures,

31:33.853 --> 31:36.812
the bullet ant, the tarantula hawk,

31:37.988 --> 31:40.381
and these little bad boys right here,

31:40.381 --> 31:42.644
the devil's tooth leech.

31:42.644 --> 31:46.561
This creature transmits
a venom into its victim.

31:46.561 --> 31:47.606
It's excruciating.

31:48.868 --> 31:50.609
It lasts for up to five hours,

31:50.609 --> 31:53.264
but then, it's over.

31:55.309 --> 31:57.877
We are growing.

32:04.014 --> 32:05.580
You were raped.

32:07.321 --> 32:10.542
You are a weak person who's
bullied at every turn.

32:11.717 --> 32:13.937
You suffer from crippling depression.

32:15.112 --> 32:17.766
And you can't say no to
anything, especially food.

32:18.854 --> 32:21.509
Folks, don't shy away from these
issues!

32:21.509 --> 32:22.858
Own them!

32:22.858 --> 32:24.382
Focus on them!

32:24.382 --> 32:25.949
Let them flood your mind.

32:25.949 --> 32:29.039
Close your eyes and do this.

32:29.039 --> 32:29.953
Now...

32:33.347 --> 32:34.958
Are you focusing on your issue?

32:37.134 --> 32:38.526
Yes.

32:38.526 --> 32:39.397
Good.

32:59.547 --> 33:01.810
Please, please, please?

33:01.810 --> 33:02.768
You do what I say!

33:02.768 --> 33:04.726
I will not ask you again!

33:19.089 --> 33:20.612
You think you scare me?

33:20.612 --> 33:21.917
You tell me.

33:21.917 --> 33:24.355
I took a bullet to the
shoulder once.

33:24.355 --> 33:25.486
Oh, yeah?

33:25.486 --> 33:26.357
Where was that?

33:35.801 --> 33:37.455
I can't.

33:37.455 --> 33:39.326
I can't.

33:39.326 --> 33:41.067
You say yes to everything else,

33:41.067 --> 33:42.808
and you're gonna say no to this?

33:42.808 --> 33:44.505
Are you crazy?

33:44.505 --> 33:45.985
What the hell lesson is this
teaching us?

33:46.899 --> 33:49.510
You obviously weren't
listening.

33:49.510 --> 33:50.903
No!

33:50.903 --> 33:52.687
No, I won't do this!

33:52.687 --> 33:54.385
No-

34:05.135 --> 34:10.096
Now, who's still thinking
about their problems?

34:22.717 --> 34:24.850
Pretty intense first day, huh?

34:24.850 --> 34:26.025
I'd say so.

34:27.418 --> 34:28.984
What the fuck was that?

34:28.984 --> 34:31.248
No way was I letting that
fuckin' thing sting me!

34:31.248 --> 34:34.381
Listen, they're just trying
it to get inside your head.

34:34.381 --> 34:36.079
Of course they're tryin'
to get inside our heads!

34:36.079 --> 34:37.645
That's the reason we're here!

34:37.645 --> 34:39.212
I'll be honest.

34:39.212 --> 34:40.344
I feel great!

34:41.910 --> 34:43.912
- What?

34:43.912 --> 34:45.914
I faced a challenge!

34:45.914 --> 34:48.352
I didn't back down!

34:48.352 --> 34:50.615
You know how long it's been
since I tried something

34:50.615 --> 34:52.356
and I was successful?

34:53.531 --> 34:55.489
You call that success?

34:56.882 --> 34:59.276
Is there any other way to
perceive it?

34:59.276 --> 35:01.191
Well, what was it for?

35:01.191 --> 35:02.496
To fuck with us.

35:07.066 --> 35:08.154
No!

35:12.637 --> 35:13.855
To clear our minds.

35:15.814 --> 35:16.684
I don't know about you,

35:16.684 --> 35:18.904
but my mind is clear.

35:23.822 --> 35:25.128
Whatever you say, man.

35:28.914 --> 35:31.656
Let's just see how tomorrow goes.

35:39.533 --> 35:41.274
You should embrace this training.

35:42.667 --> 35:44.103
Training?

35:44.103 --> 35:47.454
I'm not gonna take a fuckin'
bite from a giant leech!

35:47.454 --> 35:50.675
I'm not crazy.

36:22.489 --> 36:24.361
No!

36:42.944 --> 36:44.207
Good morning.

36:45.512 --> 36:47.949
Let's get started on day two.

36:49.299 --> 36:50.648
Shouldn't we...

36:50.648 --> 36:52.258
Shouldn't we wait for Lily?

36:53.564 --> 36:56.393
Lily is on her own path for now.

37:15.368 --> 37:16.239
Hey.

37:18.153 --> 37:19.503
Oh, hi.

37:19.503 --> 37:21.809
You're-
- The guy from the speech.

37:22.723 --> 37:25.291
Elizabeth gave me a call and
said I was back in the program.

37:27.685 --> 37:29.426
You gotta be kidding me?

37:29.426 --> 37:30.296
What?

37:32.951 --> 37:34.605
I guess I'm being kicked out.

37:35.736 --> 37:36.650
What do you mean?

37:37.608 --> 37:40.175
I failed to do the exercise yesterday,

37:40.175 --> 37:41.916
and I was punished last night,

37:41.916 --> 37:43.962
and now I'm gone.

37:43.962 --> 37:48.009
Hey, nobody told me I was
replacing anybody, okay?

37:49.315 --> 37:51.099
I mean, did somebody talk to
you?

37:52.579 --> 37:53.406
No.

37:56.409 --> 37:57.497
They just tortured me.

37:58.716 --> 38:00.805
Yesterday, Tobin challenged us
to get bit

38:00.805 --> 38:02.720
by this devil's tooth leech thing.

38:05.070 --> 38:06.289
I refused.

38:07.507 --> 38:10.510
And last night, I woke up tied
to my bed,

38:10.510 --> 38:12.033
and there were a dozen on me.

38:12.947 --> 38:13.774
Holy shit!

38:15.080 --> 38:16.299
I mean, were you bitten?

38:17.300 --> 38:19.650
So many times that I blacked out.

38:19.650 --> 38:20.520
Wow!

38:23.218 --> 38:25.917
I bet it was hard to focus on anything

38:27.701 --> 38:28.963
while that was happening?

38:31.401 --> 38:33.141
You sound just like Tobin.

38:34.839 --> 38:35.840
I do.

38:35.840 --> 38:38.321
Well, hey, okay, I'm just

38:39.278 --> 38:42.150
trying to figure out what
the lesson is in there.

38:42.150 --> 38:43.369
Whatever.

38:43.369 --> 38:45.371
I guess that's why I'm being
kicked out?

38:47.025 --> 38:47.852
Hey.

38:49.549 --> 38:50.420
You're still here.

38:52.030 --> 38:54.032
Hey, I don't see any bags packed.

38:56.426 --> 38:58.210
What's your name again?

38:58.210 --> 38:59.080
John.

39:00.081 --> 39:00.952
I'm Lily.

39:02.170 --> 39:05.043
It's nice to meet you again.

39:06.131 --> 39:07.219
You know, John,

39:09.526 --> 39:10.701
I don't know,

39:13.051 --> 39:16.271
maybe in some sick way I
needed that last night?

39:17.316 --> 39:19.797
But honestly, when those
bugs were biting me,

39:20.972 --> 39:22.321
you were right.

39:24.497 --> 39:27.195
There was nothing else
on my mind except for...

39:29.546 --> 39:30.677
Surviving.

39:31.765 --> 39:35.334
And maybe that was Tobin's
lesson?

39:37.380 --> 39:38.206
I guess.

39:39.773 --> 39:41.645
And nobody's asked you
to leave?

39:43.386 --> 39:45.126
Nobody.

39:45.126 --> 39:46.563
Then I'm sure you're still in.

39:48.478 --> 39:53.439
And you can beat this eating disorder.

39:54.135 --> 39:56.399
I never told you that's
what I was here for.

39:58.923 --> 39:59.837
I'm sorry.

39:59.837 --> 40:01.055
I was just...

40:01.055 --> 40:01.969
I was makin' a guess.

40:01.969 --> 40:04.450
I'm so fucking insensitive!

40:04.450 --> 40:05.538
So fucking [mumbles]!

40:05.538 --> 40:06.626
What the fuck is wrong with
you?!

40:06.626 --> 40:07.627
You're just so fucking
insensitive!

40:07.627 --> 40:09.063
Just lose your fuckin' shit,

40:09.063 --> 40:10.587
and you just fuckin' say
something like that?!

40:10.587 --> 40:11.675
Fuck.

40:13.241 --> 40:14.678
When you want something in life,

40:14.678 --> 40:16.419
you can't wait for it to come to you,

40:16.419 --> 40:17.898
'cause it never will.

40:17.898 --> 40:20.292
Imagine if I had a rabbit right here,

40:20.292 --> 40:23.600
what would be the first
thought that came to your mind?

40:23.600 --> 40:25.515
Don't mind if that thing bites
us?

40:25.515 --> 40:28.909
The essence
of a rabbit is to run.

40:28.909 --> 40:31.216
It runs to its next survival spot.

40:31.216 --> 40:34.480
You need to have this essence.

40:34.480 --> 40:35.438
Do you understand?

40:37.135 --> 40:38.310
I don't.

40:38.310 --> 40:40.312
That's fine.

40:40.312 --> 40:42.967
Nicole, let me make it as
simple as possible for you.

40:42.967 --> 40:46.492
What if I told you there was a
rabbit here on these grounds,

40:46.492 --> 40:48.494
and if you could find the rabbit,

40:48.494 --> 40:51.715
the rabbit was your issue,
and you could catch it,

40:51.715 --> 40:53.630
would you try to catch it?

40:53.630 --> 40:55.196
Yes.

40:55.196 --> 40:58.939
Then when you caught it,
what would you do with it?

40:58.939 --> 41:00.288
Let me guess.

41:00.288 --> 41:03.901
You're asking us to find
and kill this rabbit?

41:03.901 --> 41:05.293
Is that what you think?

41:06.730 --> 41:09.820
You think a simple rabbit
hunt will solve your problems?

41:10.864 --> 41:12.562
There's no stakes there.

41:12.562 --> 41:14.346
I don't think that'll do anything.

41:15.608 --> 41:17.523
Then what's the game?

41:17.523 --> 41:18.611
"The game?"

41:18.611 --> 41:19.525
There's no game.

41:20.787 --> 41:21.614
This is life.

41:22.833 --> 41:23.877
This is survival.

41:27.315 --> 41:28.447
How are y'all feeling?

41:32.669 --> 41:35.062
Those pills you just
took weren't vitamins.

41:35.062 --> 41:37.021
They're a fast acting poison.

41:37.021 --> 41:39.066
You'll all be dead within 20 minutes.

41:39.066 --> 41:40.067
You're jokin' with us!

41:41.199 --> 41:42.548
What the fuck?!

41:42.548 --> 41:45.508
I assure you, your death is imminent,

41:45.508 --> 41:48.249
unless-
- What do we need to do?!

41:48.249 --> 41:50.774
You can use these trackers
and find the rabbit.

41:50.774 --> 41:53.254
The rabbit has the antidote in
its blood.

41:54.168 --> 41:54.995
Catch it,

41:55.953 --> 41:57.041
and you live.

43:24.998 --> 43:26.957
- Move!

44:14.787 --> 44:16.397
Instead of anger,

44:16.397 --> 44:18.399
let's focus on relief.

44:18.399 --> 44:21.141
The fear of death changes most.

44:22.360 --> 44:25.102
How will it change you?

44:36.200 --> 44:38.289
I wanna get the fuck out of here.

44:38.289 --> 44:40.117
Likewise.

44:40.117 --> 44:41.292
And why is that?

44:43.686 --> 44:45.688
Tobin tried to kill us out there.

44:45.688 --> 44:46.819
What?

44:46.819 --> 44:47.777
How?

44:47.777 --> 44:49.604
He fucking poisoned us.

44:49.604 --> 44:50.518
Focus!

44:50.518 --> 44:52.695
I'll ask a simple question.

44:54.087 --> 44:55.088
Do you want to stay?

44:56.394 --> 44:57.569
Fuck no.

44:57.569 --> 44:59.919
I want to.

44:59.919 --> 45:02.530
Lily, do you want to stay?

45:03.793 --> 45:06.360
I'd like to keep going
and see where we're headed.

45:06.360 --> 45:07.405
Jesse?

45:08.580 --> 45:10.713
Not 100% sure.

45:10.713 --> 45:11.714
Yes or no!

45:13.498 --> 45:15.848
If you'd let me finish,

45:15.848 --> 45:19.765
I was going to say, I'm not 100%
sure...

45:19.765 --> 45:22.072
But, yes.

45:25.379 --> 45:28.469
After you got poisoned today?

45:28.469 --> 45:30.123
Yet, you are all still here.

45:31.211 --> 45:33.561
Because of the antidote.

45:33.561 --> 45:36.086
Yes, there was some danger,

45:36.086 --> 45:37.827
but that wasn't all that happened.

45:39.176 --> 45:40.525
What I saw was victory.

45:42.266 --> 45:43.093
Don't you see?

45:44.007 --> 45:46.574
You all came here with
such massive problems,

45:47.750 --> 45:49.839
and in just two short days,

45:51.275 --> 45:52.972
where are your problems now?

45:54.495 --> 45:57.847
You're all free to leave anytime,

45:58.848 --> 45:59.936
but you know the deal.

46:02.025 --> 46:05.245
You'll owe us the $75,000
for the treatment.

46:05.245 --> 46:07.508
So you're just gonna
keep us here to blackmail?

46:07.508 --> 46:10.033
No, Frank, we're only
honoring the agreement

46:10.033 --> 46:12.426
that you freely entered into.

46:13.427 --> 46:14.602
Where is this going?

46:16.561 --> 46:20.783
Each day has gotten worse,
and worse, and worse.

46:20.783 --> 46:22.915
But you've got so much better!

46:25.091 --> 46:26.701
I know this is hard to believe,

46:28.007 --> 46:30.314
but if you trust the process,

46:31.358 --> 46:32.969
you will see results.

46:34.709 --> 46:37.364
I'm not takin' another fuckin'
vitamin!

46:37.364 --> 46:38.235
Yeah.

46:39.062 --> 46:40.019
Me neither.

46:41.020 --> 46:43.501
Fine, I'll eliminate that.

46:47.984 --> 46:48.811
Are we good?

46:50.595 --> 46:51.988
I wanna give this my all.

46:54.686 --> 46:57.254
Yeah, I guess I'll stay here.

47:00.431 --> 47:03.390
I can't.

47:03.390 --> 47:05.871
We'll continue
the program tomorrow.

47:09.614 --> 47:13.444
Day three, Tobin made us
swallow a poisoned pill.

47:14.401 --> 47:17.709
I'll wait until the time is
right to make the arrest.

47:17.709 --> 47:19.798
Hoping to avoid any damage.

47:25.325 --> 47:26.196
Hey.

47:27.632 --> 47:28.459
Jesse, right?

47:30.591 --> 47:31.418
And you are?

47:33.333 --> 47:34.160
John.

47:36.206 --> 47:37.772
We met at the speech.

47:41.298 --> 47:42.125
That's right.

47:43.343 --> 47:45.345
What are you doing here?

47:48.740 --> 47:49.567
Tobin called,

47:50.437 --> 47:51.438
said I was back in.

48:06.976 --> 48:07.802
Hey, man,

48:10.370 --> 48:11.197
I'm a friend.

48:13.678 --> 48:15.245
I don't know what your issue is.

48:19.771 --> 48:22.730
Clearly, mine is boundaries.

48:25.342 --> 48:26.343
Personal space.

50:18.411 --> 50:21.066
Whatever we all thought
this was, it's not.

50:21.066 --> 50:23.199
What are you talkin' about?

50:23.199 --> 50:25.375
What the fuck do you
think she's talkin' about?

50:26.463 --> 50:30.293
The drugs, the poison, the manipulation.

50:30.293 --> 50:31.555
It's a maze out there.

50:33.600 --> 50:34.819
Are you fuckin' blind?

50:36.342 --> 50:38.866
Oh, wait, you didn't have
to experience any of this,

50:38.866 --> 50:39.998
did you, Lily?

50:42.087 --> 50:43.567
I did.

50:43.567 --> 50:45.047
What are you talking about?

50:45.047 --> 50:46.004
The leeches.

50:47.571 --> 50:48.441
No.

50:48.441 --> 50:49.660
No, no, you bailed on that.

50:49.660 --> 50:51.053
You didn't have the guts.

50:51.053 --> 50:53.403
Maybe so, but that night after
I bailed,

50:55.144 --> 50:57.189
I woke up tied to the bed,

50:58.799 --> 50:59.800
and they were all over me.

50:59.800 --> 51:01.933
- You see?!
- What?

51:01.933 --> 51:04.327
You didn't sign up to be tied
down!

51:04.327 --> 51:07.634
I didn't sign up to have
my fucking life threatened,

51:07.634 --> 51:09.810
or have to eat a live fuckin'
bunny.

51:11.943 --> 51:13.292
Yes, Jesse,

51:13.292 --> 51:14.641
but I'd be lying if I didn't
admit

51:14.641 --> 51:16.861
that I understood the lesson.

51:16.861 --> 51:17.949
I mean...

51:19.081 --> 51:23.215
Oh!

51:23.215 --> 51:24.695
I mean, I get it!

51:26.088 --> 51:28.916
Like, sure, I expected like hallucinogens,

51:28.916 --> 51:31.093
or mushrooms, or somethin'.

51:31.093 --> 51:33.095
Okay, guys, it's been pretty extreme,

51:33.095 --> 51:36.359
but this is Tobin Vance!

51:36.359 --> 51:38.100
Tobin-fucking-Vance, indeed!

51:38.100 --> 51:40.058
Okay, even at the initial
conference where we all met,

51:40.058 --> 51:41.668
what did he say?

51:41.668 --> 51:42.974
"Results."

51:45.194 --> 51:47.370
He promised results!

51:47.370 --> 51:50.851
If your baby was dying,
and he had a solution,

51:50.851 --> 51:53.463
would you care what he
did if he got results?

51:53.463 --> 51:54.855
- Well-
- No!

51:54.855 --> 51:56.379
No, you fucking wouldn't!

51:57.597 --> 51:59.251
Well, guess what?

51:59.251 --> 52:01.775
It's not your babies that are dying.

52:01.775 --> 52:03.255
It's you.

52:03.255 --> 52:04.474
It's us!

52:05.388 --> 52:07.781
We're fucking dying out here,

52:07.781 --> 52:10.567
and he is offering us a
second chance at life!

52:13.004 --> 52:15.441
I know I haven't been here
for the intense stuff,

52:16.442 --> 52:17.748
but I'm fucking ready!

52:20.925 --> 52:23.188
And Elizabeth says that
you're all rock stars?

52:24.102 --> 52:27.453
I am honored to go on
this journey with you.

52:34.112 --> 52:35.200
He's good.

52:37.507 --> 52:38.464
We'll see.

52:41.728 --> 52:42.729
Mask.

52:51.912 --> 52:55.002
And then I started hearing
all these weird stories.

52:55.002 --> 52:57.048
I mean, really weird stories about

52:57.048 --> 53:01.313
these extreme wellness retreats.

53:01.313 --> 53:02.575
Extreme.

53:04.316 --> 53:07.058
So when did it all start
to unravel for you?

53:07.058 --> 53:09.408
For me, it was the
experimental retreats.

53:10.409 --> 53:12.759
They became too violent,

53:12.759 --> 53:14.326
and-
- Violent?

53:14.326 --> 53:15.545
Too militant,

53:15.545 --> 53:16.763
and-
- Militant.

53:16.763 --> 53:19.244
Everyone was trying to outdo
each other

53:19.244 --> 53:21.464
to get to the top of the organization.

53:21.464 --> 53:23.596
The top being Tobin.

53:23.596 --> 53:24.989
Tobin Vance!

53:26.033 --> 53:26.860
Right?

53:28.079 --> 53:30.342
Thank you all for making it
this far.

53:30.342 --> 53:31.952
Today's exercise is a variation of

53:31.952 --> 53:34.999
something called family constellations.

53:34.999 --> 53:37.480
John here has been
through a lot in his life,

53:37.480 --> 53:39.090
so we're gonna aid him

53:39.090 --> 53:41.658
by guiding him through
a moment in his history,

53:41.658 --> 53:43.573
taking on the traits of his family.

53:43.573 --> 53:44.791
John, do you understand?

53:47.011 --> 53:48.969
Yeah, I think.

53:49.883 --> 53:51.842
You simply go to each
member of the group

53:51.842 --> 53:54.410
and assign them a role in your family,

53:54.410 --> 53:57.630
and then we'll improvise a
moment from your childhood.

53:58.936 --> 54:00.764
John, assign each member

54:00.764 --> 54:03.027
of the group a role from your family,

54:03.027 --> 54:04.333
and then let's begin.

54:12.906 --> 54:14.995
The first memory I have of my family,

54:16.649 --> 54:19.043
I was in my room,

54:20.479 --> 54:21.785
and I heard a noise,

54:21.785 --> 54:26.529
yelling, screaming, pleading.

54:28.052 --> 54:30.315
And when I went to find
out what had happened,

54:32.578 --> 54:34.058
my sister was in the corner.

54:35.842 --> 54:37.322
She didn't have any pants on.

54:39.759 --> 54:42.066
My mother was hitting her,

54:43.110 --> 54:45.199
slapping her, cursing at her.

54:47.289 --> 54:50.030
Quiet, you pathetic, little
ingrate!

54:50.030 --> 54:52.032
Please, Mommy, please, no!

54:52.032 --> 54:55.514
Wait until I tell your father.

54:55.514 --> 54:59.213
My father was putting his
clothes on.

54:59.213 --> 55:03.261
The cunt, the filthy fucking rapist.

55:06.569 --> 55:10.094
Jesse, you play me,

55:12.618 --> 55:14.316
and walk in.

55:14.316 --> 55:15.752
This is fucked!

55:18.363 --> 55:20.583
Let's do this...

55:20.583 --> 55:21.453
For John.

55:24.848 --> 55:26.328
I can't do this.

55:27.416 --> 55:29.069
I can't hurt anyone.

55:29.896 --> 55:31.855
But you did, you did.

55:34.771 --> 55:38.775
You raped my sister.

55:40.994 --> 55:44.998
You beat my mother.

55:47.827 --> 55:49.829
And you did stuff to me.

55:50.700 --> 55:51.701
You monster!

55:54.704 --> 55:56.445
You think, wee man?

55:58.185 --> 55:59.012
Just wait.

56:01.667 --> 56:04.670
I'll show ya a real fucking monster.

56:06.455 --> 56:09.109
[sobs] Daddy,
please don't hurt him!

56:09.109 --> 56:12.025
Please, Daddy, don't hurt him!

56:12.025 --> 56:13.636
Come on, Dad.

56:13.636 --> 56:16.029
Show me what you got.

56:16.029 --> 56:18.815
I will fucking destroy you!

56:18.815 --> 56:22.253
- Good, Frank.

56:22.253 --> 56:23.080
How do you feel?

56:23.080 --> 56:23.950
Do you feel powerful?

56:25.474 --> 56:26.344
Yeah.

56:27.258 --> 56:28.912
Big man hittin' women.

56:29.782 --> 56:32.263
Jesse, walk in and ask what's
happening.

56:32.263 --> 56:33.569
What's happening?

56:33.569 --> 56:34.918
Nothing's happened dear.

56:35.788 --> 56:37.094
I just hurt myself again.

56:38.617 --> 56:39.923
I'm just clumsy.

56:40.924 --> 56:41.838
Go to bed now.

56:43.013 --> 56:45.145
I'll tuck your sister into bed.

56:47.409 --> 56:49.062
You monster!

56:49.062 --> 56:51.195
You fucking monster!

56:51.195 --> 56:52.979
You are this.

56:52.979 --> 56:54.590
You are sick!

56:54.590 --> 56:56.200
You are deranged!

56:57.767 --> 57:01.074
I'll show you the biggest
man you've ever fucking seen!

57:02.249 --> 57:04.426
I will fucking devour you!

57:08.734 --> 57:10.562
Don't!

57:13.217 --> 57:15.175
Frank, stop!

57:20.529 --> 57:21.660
No!

57:25.316 --> 57:26.535
What?

57:26.535 --> 57:27.753
What did I do?

57:29.799 --> 57:32.323
Perspective, ladies and gentlemen.

57:32.323 --> 57:36.806
Good, bad, ugly, it's humanity.

57:36.806 --> 57:38.503
It's disgusting!

57:39.722 --> 57:41.158
It's painful,

57:41.985 --> 57:44.204
but it's manageable,

57:44.204 --> 57:49.253
if we can explore how it
unfolds, and how we perceive it.

57:49.601 --> 57:51.690
What is going through
your body right now?!

57:54.084 --> 57:56.173
I'm scared.

57:56.173 --> 57:57.479
Scared of who?

57:59.045 --> 58:00.394
Scared of you.

58:02.092 --> 58:03.615
Expand on that.

58:03.615 --> 58:04.834
Scared of who?

58:06.226 --> 58:07.924
You're scared of your father.

58:07.924 --> 58:09.665
Yeah.

58:09.665 --> 58:11.623
You inhabited him very well, huh?

58:12.885 --> 58:15.584
[sobs] I don't
know what the fuck.

58:18.456 --> 58:22.547
Frank, did you feel powerful

58:22.547 --> 58:25.332
when you were telling
everyone else what to do?

58:28.727 --> 58:30.990
- Maybe.
- No, no, no, maybe!

58:30.990 --> 58:31.817
Okay?

58:31.817 --> 58:34.603
Yes, strength and power!

58:35.952 --> 58:38.215
I want you to hold onto those things.

58:38.215 --> 58:39.521
It wasn't for the right reasons,

58:39.521 --> 58:40.696
but you hold onto them.

58:40.696 --> 58:41.827
Frank, look at me!

58:41.827 --> 58:44.308
Look at me.

58:44.308 --> 58:45.483
Okay?

58:45.483 --> 58:48.181
Strength, power, courage, initiative.

58:48.181 --> 58:49.443
You are not your father,

58:50.357 --> 58:53.273
but you can take his best qualities

58:53.273 --> 58:55.624
and keep your moral compass.

59:03.806 --> 59:06.765
I felt like I was
turning into someone else.

59:06.765 --> 59:09.551
You were experiencing the
emotions of John's sister.

59:11.509 --> 59:13.642
Telepathy is real, folks.

59:14.686 --> 59:17.950
It exists when we let others
inside our experiences,

59:17.950 --> 59:19.822
but we can't let everyone in.

59:21.824 --> 59:22.825
How'd they do, John?

59:24.261 --> 59:25.436
I hate them.

59:28.047 --> 59:29.658
I hate them,

59:29.658 --> 59:32.356
but I understand them now.

59:33.792 --> 59:36.055
I think we all learned
a lesson here today.

59:46.718 --> 59:47.937
Please exit the hall.

59:47.937 --> 59:49.155
We're finished for now.

59:50.635 --> 59:54.160
I highly recommend a nap
before the next stage.

59:54.160 --> 59:57.076
Food and drinks will be brought
to your rooms momentarily.

59:58.208 --> 01:00:01.124
This exercise is so emotionally draining,

01:00:01.124 --> 01:00:02.995
you may feel a bit strange,

01:00:04.649 --> 01:00:06.999
so I would like you to
eat and drink everything,

01:00:06.999 --> 01:00:09.915
as you'll need all the calories
to replenish your energy.

01:00:14.833 --> 01:00:15.965
I can see the worry,

01:00:16.835 --> 01:00:18.445
the fear of anticipation,

01:00:19.621 --> 01:00:20.665
but today is simple.

01:00:20.665 --> 01:00:22.145
Shooting.

01:00:22.145 --> 01:00:23.581
Riflery.

01:00:23.581 --> 01:00:25.191
When the world is holding you back,

01:00:25.191 --> 01:00:27.672
you need to focus your aim on
your goal,

01:00:27.672 --> 01:00:29.631
so that when life propels you forward,

01:00:29.631 --> 01:00:31.241
you can hit your target.

01:00:31.241 --> 01:00:34.026
There's something so simple
about picking up a rifle,

01:00:34.026 --> 01:00:36.289
pointing at your target,
setting your sights,

01:00:36.289 --> 01:00:38.030
and then, bam,

01:00:38.030 --> 01:00:39.031
hitting the target.

01:00:40.554 --> 01:00:43.209
Today, I
need your energy up, folks.

01:00:44.167 --> 01:00:47.083
There'll be no more vitamins or pills.

01:00:47.083 --> 01:00:48.258
Or poison?

01:00:50.347 --> 01:00:51.827
Or poison.

01:00:51.827 --> 01:00:55.657
Just pure adrenaline for a
simple task.

01:00:55.657 --> 01:00:57.571
Each of you will pick up a rifle,

01:00:57.571 --> 01:00:59.356
and point it at that target,

01:00:59.356 --> 01:01:00.966
and that target is your issue,

01:01:00.966 --> 01:01:03.665
and the bullet is your energy.

01:01:03.665 --> 01:01:05.144
I want you to flood your mind.

01:01:05.144 --> 01:01:06.102
Focus, truly!

01:01:06.102 --> 01:01:08.278
When that is filling your mind,

01:01:08.278 --> 01:01:09.888
your issue is in your mind,

01:01:09.888 --> 01:01:11.237
that's all you can focus on,

01:01:11.237 --> 01:01:12.238
then you pull the trigger,

01:01:12.238 --> 01:01:15.285
and you destroy that problem!

01:01:16.199 --> 01:01:17.026
Simple enough?

01:01:18.288 --> 01:01:19.681
Anyone shot a rifle before?

01:01:20.769 --> 01:01:21.639
I have.

01:01:22.945 --> 01:01:24.294
Good.

01:01:24.294 --> 01:01:26.818
John.

01:01:26.818 --> 01:01:27.819
Good.

01:01:27.819 --> 01:01:29.168
Now, breathe.

01:01:30.256 --> 01:01:31.867
Focus.

01:01:31.867 --> 01:01:32.737
Okay.

01:01:32.737 --> 01:01:34.739
That target is your problem,

01:01:34.739 --> 01:01:37.437
and that bullet is your energy.

01:01:37.437 --> 01:01:40.658
When you are ready, you let it go.

01:01:47.752 --> 01:01:48.579
Great!

01:01:48.579 --> 01:01:50.233
John, how do you feel?

01:01:50.233 --> 01:01:51.756
I feel freakin' amazing.

01:01:53.671 --> 01:01:56.630
Frank, you're next.

01:01:59.546 --> 01:02:00.417
Try again.

01:02:06.771 --> 01:02:07.685
Great!

01:02:09.165 --> 01:02:10.470
Lily, you're next.

01:02:10.470 --> 01:02:11.341
Focus.

01:02:14.474 --> 01:02:16.128
Try again.

01:02:24.658 --> 01:02:25.747
Don't disappoint me.

01:02:31.404 --> 01:02:32.318
Jesse, you're up.

01:02:43.155 --> 01:02:44.504
Amazing!

01:02:44.504 --> 01:02:46.768
Jesse, where did you
learn to shoot like that?

01:02:46.768 --> 01:02:48.247
Boy Scouts.

01:02:48.247 --> 01:02:51.294
Wow, I didn't know they
had rifles in Boy Scouts?

01:02:51.294 --> 01:02:52.164
I'm glad.

01:02:55.341 --> 01:02:56.255
Piece of cake.

01:02:57.387 --> 01:02:58.431
Well, hang on then.

01:02:59.432 --> 01:03:01.173
Maybe this is all a little too
easy?

01:03:11.836 --> 01:03:13.403
What the hell is this?

01:03:14.491 --> 01:03:16.798
This?

01:03:17.711 --> 01:03:20.671
This is a pig who raped three women.

01:03:20.671 --> 01:03:23.021
Let's welcome Henry to our
little party.

01:03:23.021 --> 01:03:23.979
Hang on.

01:03:23.979 --> 01:03:26.068
No, no, you hang on!

01:03:26.068 --> 01:03:27.939
You make a choice right now.

01:03:29.288 --> 01:03:31.290
Don't think, react.

01:03:31.290 --> 01:03:35.686
You can hit the target, or
you can hit the pig rapist!

01:03:35.686 --> 01:03:36.818
No, we have to

01:03:36.818 --> 01:03:38.471
call the police.
- Stand down, Jesse!

01:03:38.471 --> 01:03:39.559
Fuck you!

01:03:39.559 --> 01:03:40.517
If Nicole does that-

01:03:40.517 --> 01:03:41.692
No one moves!

01:03:45.217 --> 01:03:46.392
Your choice.

01:03:47.437 --> 01:03:48.612
Killer.

01:03:58.056 --> 01:03:59.753
Come on, don't do this!

01:03:59.753 --> 01:04:02.278
- You're not a killer!

01:04:02.278 --> 01:04:05.281
You don't fuckin' know me.

01:04:09.154 --> 01:04:09.981
One more.

01:04:09.981 --> 01:04:11.287
No, Nicole, stand down.

01:04:12.766 --> 01:04:14.290
Let her do it.

01:04:14.290 --> 01:04:15.595
What did you say?

01:04:15.595 --> 01:04:17.336
I said, "Let her do it!"

01:04:17.336 --> 01:04:18.990
You don't make the rules here, John.

01:04:18.990 --> 01:04:21.079
I'd watch myself, if I were you.

01:04:21.079 --> 01:04:22.951
Day four is over.

01:04:22.951 --> 01:04:24.343
Let's go back to the cabin.

01:04:25.605 --> 01:04:27.564
- Hey.

01:04:28.957 --> 01:04:31.350
So you don't have the
balls to finish him off?

01:04:31.350 --> 01:04:32.221
John...

01:04:34.701 --> 01:04:37.748
Let me show you how it's done.

01:04:37.748 --> 01:04:40.794
- John?

01:04:40.794 --> 01:04:43.406
- No, don't do it!
- No!

01:04:45.625 --> 01:04:50.282
- Yeah!

01:04:50.282 --> 01:04:52.241
- Out of my way.
- Jesse.

01:05:03.078 --> 01:05:05.123
Bro, what are you doing?

01:05:08.866 --> 01:05:10.520
Jesse, wait!

01:05:10.520 --> 01:05:12.130
Everybody stay back!

01:05:12.130 --> 01:05:13.958
- What are you doin', Jesse?
- We've got a situation here.

01:05:13.958 --> 01:05:15.873
A fuckin' murder!

01:05:15.873 --> 01:05:17.179
It's you.

01:05:21.835 --> 01:05:23.837
A man just got murdered,

01:05:23.837 --> 01:05:25.970
and shit is about to go down.

01:05:25.970 --> 01:05:27.319
I'm a police officer.

01:05:27.319 --> 01:05:28.407
Do you understand me?

01:05:38.200 --> 01:05:39.375
Okay, so these people
who sign up

01:05:39.375 --> 01:05:40.898
a bit skeptical, wouldn't they,

01:05:40.898 --> 01:05:42.334
in light of what's goin' on?

01:05:44.293 --> 01:05:45.816
He's convincing.

01:05:45.816 --> 01:05:46.991
He's what?

01:05:46.991 --> 01:05:49.385
- He's very convincing.
- So was Hitler.

01:05:49.385 --> 01:05:50.690
So was Hitler.

01:05:50.690 --> 01:05:52.649
You give that man a
stage with a few people,

01:05:53.606 --> 01:05:55.739
he'll have an army of
followers in no time.

01:05:58.350 --> 01:06:00.091
Wake up, Nicole.

01:06:14.714 --> 01:06:16.020
Who is that?

01:06:20.982 --> 01:06:23.027
I'm proud of you, truly.

01:06:23.027 --> 01:06:26.030
You showed real initiative on
the range.

01:06:26.030 --> 01:06:27.553
You must have an anger inside.

01:06:29.338 --> 01:06:30.817
The first night I was here,

01:06:34.299 --> 01:06:35.126
did I kill him?

01:06:37.085 --> 01:06:38.086
Yes.

01:06:39.087 --> 01:06:40.305
You are strong.

01:06:40.305 --> 01:06:42.046
You are not a victim.

01:06:42.046 --> 01:06:44.309
I know everything about you.

01:06:44.309 --> 01:06:45.789
I know your thoughts.

01:06:45.789 --> 01:06:48.444
I'm in your head.

01:06:48.444 --> 01:06:49.575
You're not weak.

01:06:49.575 --> 01:06:51.055
You're a fighter!

01:06:51.055 --> 01:06:54.232
And you will prove that,
finally, once and for all.

01:06:55.103 --> 01:06:57.583
Is this your idea of a cure?

01:06:57.583 --> 01:06:59.585
Turn me into a murderer?

01:06:59.585 --> 01:07:03.328
No, I promised you I'd give
you results.

01:07:03.328 --> 01:07:04.329
I'd cure you.

01:07:05.200 --> 01:07:06.505
Your weakness was taken away

01:07:06.505 --> 01:07:08.594
from something that
happened a long time ago.

01:07:08.594 --> 01:07:09.943
Tell me what that was,

01:07:09.943 --> 01:07:11.641
and don't dare give me that story

01:07:11.641 --> 01:07:13.121
about your mother shooting your father

01:07:13.121 --> 01:07:15.036
and you becoming ward of the state.

01:07:18.474 --> 01:07:21.259
My father raped me when I was 12.

01:07:22.478 --> 01:07:23.653
Yes.

01:07:23.653 --> 01:07:24.784
Say it again, Nicole.

01:07:26.395 --> 01:07:29.093
My father raped me when I was 12.

01:07:29.093 --> 01:07:30.268
What happened after?

01:07:31.443 --> 01:07:32.966
After I reported him,

01:07:34.620 --> 01:07:35.447
nothing happened.

01:07:36.318 --> 01:07:38.363
Nobody believed me,

01:07:38.363 --> 01:07:40.539
and then, he left.

01:07:40.539 --> 01:07:43.499
He left my mother and me,

01:07:43.499 --> 01:07:46.980
and we never saw that piece of
shit again.

01:07:47.851 --> 01:07:50.767
That memory is holding you back.

01:07:50.767 --> 01:07:53.552
You need to get your
father out of your head.

01:07:54.423 --> 01:07:56.816
There's no way that's ever
gonna happen.

01:07:56.816 --> 01:07:59.167
What if you can get
him out of your life?

01:08:11.135 --> 01:08:14.312
Where did you find this pig?

01:08:14.312 --> 01:08:15.748
You don't need to know that.

01:08:15.748 --> 01:08:18.316
All you need to know is that he
is here,

01:08:18.316 --> 01:08:21.189
and he is the source of your weakness,

01:08:21.189 --> 01:08:24.714
and if you can rid the world
of one more piece of shit,

01:08:24.714 --> 01:08:25.932
then you will rid the world

01:08:25.932 --> 01:08:29.327
of everything that is holding
you back!

01:08:31.068 --> 01:08:33.636
No, leave it on.

01:08:34.680 --> 01:08:36.117
I don't wanna hear his voice.

01:08:36.987 --> 01:08:39.294
I hear it enough in my head.

01:10:22.223 --> 01:10:23.746
You can make a choice, Frank.

01:10:26.662 --> 01:10:30.753
You can prove that you
could stand up for yourself.

01:10:30.753 --> 01:10:32.450
I'm not the person I was.

01:10:34.800 --> 01:10:36.628
I could man up.

01:10:38.413 --> 01:10:39.849
I could do things.

01:10:41.285 --> 01:10:44.245
Good, Frank, good.

01:10:45.637 --> 01:10:47.813
You just tell me what I need
to do.

01:10:49.119 --> 01:10:52.035
Take that bat and crush it.

01:10:52.035 --> 01:10:54.255
Smash it to pieces.

01:11:10.009 --> 01:11:12.403
What are you waiting for?

01:11:13.361 --> 01:11:14.753
It's...

01:11:14.753 --> 01:11:15.754
It's crying.

01:11:18.235 --> 01:11:20.324
What are you doing?

01:11:20.324 --> 01:11:21.194
It's...

01:11:22.674 --> 01:11:23.501
Is that...

01:11:25.068 --> 01:11:26.287
Is that...

01:11:26.287 --> 01:11:29.507
Pick up the bat and smash it.

01:11:29.507 --> 01:11:33.511
I can't.

01:11:33.511 --> 01:11:35.165
I can't.

01:11:35.165 --> 01:11:36.645
Yes, you can!

01:11:36.645 --> 01:11:38.951
Pick up the bat and smash it!

01:11:40.910 --> 01:11:41.693
Do it!

01:11:41.693 --> 01:11:43.304
No!

01:11:43.304 --> 01:11:45.306
Crush your fears!

01:11:45.306 --> 01:11:48.526
No!

01:11:48.526 --> 01:11:50.485
Good, Frank.

01:11:52.313 --> 01:11:53.139
Good.

01:11:58.057 --> 01:11:59.189
What's he doin' here?

01:12:01.060 --> 01:12:03.062
John here doesn't hesitate.

01:12:03.062 --> 01:12:04.281
He takes what he wants.

01:12:05.413 --> 01:12:08.285
That man is a pedophile
who needs to be punished.

01:12:14.639 --> 01:12:15.727
So what now, Frank?

01:12:16.946 --> 01:12:18.077
You made a choice.

01:12:18.948 --> 01:12:20.079
You stood up to me.

01:12:23.648 --> 01:12:28.697
I'm so sorry!

01:12:29.915 --> 01:12:31.526
I couldn't do it.

01:12:34.267 --> 01:12:36.618
I just couldn't go through with
it!

01:12:42.885 --> 01:12:44.365
Dammit, Frank!

01:12:44.365 --> 01:12:45.496
You were there!

01:12:45.496 --> 01:12:47.237
You were so close!

01:12:47.237 --> 01:12:48.194
You stood up to me!

01:12:48.194 --> 01:12:49.935
You challenged me, and then...

01:12:51.372 --> 01:12:52.808
Blew it.

01:12:52.808 --> 01:12:54.505
Get him the fuck off this earth!

01:12:55.767 --> 01:12:57.508
Sorry, Frank.

01:13:03.645 --> 01:13:05.124
Lost another one, huh, Tobin?

01:13:16.353 --> 01:13:19.182
What the fuck is
going on?

01:13:19.182 --> 01:13:20.923
Lily.

01:13:20.923 --> 01:13:22.446
Oh, Lily,

01:13:22.446 --> 01:13:25.057
I'm proud of the way you've
embraced these trainings.

01:13:26.363 --> 01:13:27.277
What the hell?

01:13:27.277 --> 01:13:29.061
What happened to Frank?

01:13:29.061 --> 01:13:30.498
Focus, Lily.

01:13:32.195 --> 01:13:33.631
I'll handle this, John.

01:13:33.631 --> 01:13:35.459
Lily, my dear, you've done well.

01:13:35.459 --> 01:13:36.417
You've changed!

01:13:37.287 --> 01:13:40.116
But you really haven't
faced that many challenges.

01:13:40.116 --> 01:13:41.683
Is Frank dead?

01:13:43.424 --> 01:13:44.773
Are you gonna kill me?

01:13:44.773 --> 01:13:45.904
Shut it!

01:13:45.904 --> 01:13:47.123
You say Frank's name one more time,

01:13:47.123 --> 01:13:48.341
and I swear to god,

01:13:48.341 --> 01:13:49.342
I'll have John put a bullet in
your head,

01:13:49.342 --> 01:13:50.735
just like he did to Frank!

01:13:52.781 --> 01:13:54.130
Now, what do we have here?

01:13:56.437 --> 01:13:57.438
We have a final meal.

01:13:58.874 --> 01:14:01.790
A last supper, so to speak.

01:14:01.790 --> 01:14:03.444
What does that mean?

01:14:05.315 --> 01:14:06.577
John?

01:14:20.417 --> 01:14:23.246
What are you gonna make
me do?

01:14:23.246 --> 01:14:25.161
You're going to eat that.

01:14:25.161 --> 01:14:27.468
You're going to eat the weak.

01:14:30.471 --> 01:14:31.341
Initially, we were just gonna
have to have

01:14:31.341 --> 01:14:32.342
you eat some leeches,

01:14:32.342 --> 01:14:33.778
but things happened,

01:14:33.778 --> 01:14:36.302
and, well, Frank's weak,

01:14:36.302 --> 01:14:40.568
and if you eat Frank, you'll
be eating your weakness.

01:14:40.568 --> 01:14:42.178
I can't.

01:14:42.178 --> 01:14:43.832
You can and you will!

01:14:45.616 --> 01:14:46.487
No.

01:14:46.487 --> 01:14:48.489
Say yes to this.

01:14:48.489 --> 01:14:50.403
You say yes to everything else,

01:14:50.403 --> 01:14:51.796
say yes to this!

01:14:51.796 --> 01:14:54.625
No.

01:14:54.625 --> 01:14:56.497
Put the fucking skin in your
mouth!

01:14:58.586 --> 01:15:00.849
Don't any of you fucking move!

01:15:03.373 --> 01:15:06.332
Lily, pull your chair back.

01:15:09.727 --> 01:15:12.948
You're a fucking murderer, Tobin Vance.

01:15:12.948 --> 01:15:14.602
And you, too, John.

01:15:14.602 --> 01:15:16.429
Whatever the fuck your name is!

01:15:17.996 --> 01:15:20.956
I take it you're working
for Vance, too, huh?

01:15:20.956 --> 01:15:22.044
Well, guess what?

01:15:22.044 --> 01:15:23.785
You're all going to jail.

01:15:23.785 --> 01:15:26.265
I'm a police officer.

01:15:26.265 --> 01:15:28.572
That's right, dickhead!

01:15:28.572 --> 01:15:31.357
I've been documenting everything.

01:15:32.402 --> 01:15:34.404
And I've seen you fucks kill people.

01:15:35.666 --> 01:15:36.537
Twice now!

01:15:39.365 --> 01:15:40.758
You're gonna pay.

01:15:42.325 --> 01:15:44.327
Haven't we changed you, Jesse?

01:15:46.895 --> 01:15:49.114
That is a fucking joke!

01:15:50.333 --> 01:15:51.813
This whole retreat is a joke.

01:15:54.816 --> 01:15:55.643
Then shoot me.

01:15:57.862 --> 01:15:58.689
What?

01:16:00.082 --> 01:16:00.952
Shoot me.

01:16:00.952 --> 01:16:02.867
Let's see if you have the guts.

01:16:02.867 --> 01:16:03.912
Oh.

01:16:03.912 --> 01:16:05.043
Oh, I have the guts.

01:16:06.001 --> 01:16:07.437
20 years on the force.

01:16:08.569 --> 01:16:09.961
So what?

01:16:09.961 --> 01:16:11.659
You're an undercover cop?

01:16:11.659 --> 01:16:14.618
You stay the fuck out of this,
John!

01:16:14.618 --> 01:16:16.446
Had you figured out all along!

01:16:20.972 --> 01:16:23.279
Sit down!

01:16:24.889 --> 01:16:28.240
No, you're gonna have
to shoot me to learn.

01:16:28.240 --> 01:16:29.328
To learn what, huh?

01:16:31.156 --> 01:16:33.289
That I can put down a piece of
shit?

01:16:33.289 --> 01:16:35.857
I already learned that.

01:16:35.857 --> 01:16:36.684
Do it now!

01:16:36.684 --> 01:16:38.120
Shut the fuck up!

01:16:38.120 --> 01:16:39.382
Both of you!

01:16:39.382 --> 01:16:40.862
Pull the trigger!

01:16:51.873 --> 01:16:53.135
You!

01:16:53.135 --> 01:16:55.485
You fucking bastards!

01:16:55.485 --> 01:16:58.053
You loaded my gun with blanks!

01:16:59.707 --> 01:17:00.795
Did we, Jesse,

01:17:02.448 --> 01:17:03.275
or did you?

01:17:04.494 --> 01:17:05.974
What the fuck are you talkin'
about?

01:17:07.497 --> 01:17:09.586
I'm a police officer.

01:17:09.586 --> 01:17:13.068
I've been a police officer for
20 years!

01:17:13.068 --> 01:17:14.722
You're not a cop.

01:17:14.722 --> 01:17:16.549
You're simply insane.

01:17:17.986 --> 01:17:20.118
Elizabeth.

01:17:23.556 --> 01:17:24.819
Jesse Donovan,

01:17:24.819 --> 01:17:26.603
in and out of psychiatric institutions

01:17:26.603 --> 01:17:28.039
since he was 12-years-old.

01:17:28.039 --> 01:17:31.086
Rejected by the Police Academy
six times.

01:17:31.086 --> 01:17:34.045
Arrested twice for
impersonating an officer.

01:17:35.525 --> 01:17:36.744
But my gun?

01:17:37.875 --> 01:17:40.095
Jesse, you're not a cop.

01:17:40.095 --> 01:17:41.531
You're a nobody.

01:17:41.531 --> 01:17:43.576
You're gun has blanks in it.

01:17:43.576 --> 01:17:45.535
The same blanks you bought.

01:17:45.535 --> 01:17:48.233
No.

01:17:49.931 --> 01:17:53.021
Blanks.

01:17:54.892 --> 01:17:56.894
Still do the job this way!

01:17:58.026 --> 01:17:59.462
No, Jesse, wait!

01:18:05.947 --> 01:18:08.689
That was the first time in a
long time.

01:18:10.429 --> 01:18:13.041
That was not the result that I wanted.

01:18:14.738 --> 01:18:15.783
And Jesse, too, huh?

01:18:18.307 --> 01:18:19.134
What's that?

01:18:20.613 --> 01:18:21.789
You just keep failing.

01:18:48.337 --> 01:18:49.207
Clean this mess up.

01:18:58.086 --> 01:19:00.915
Maybe he's lost the
ability to close candidates?

01:19:02.960 --> 01:19:05.049
What are you getting at?

01:19:05.049 --> 01:19:07.530
Tobin wanted Jesse as an acolyte.

01:19:07.530 --> 01:19:08.792
Frank, too.

01:19:08.792 --> 01:19:11.273
He wanted all of them,
and he only got two.

01:19:14.015 --> 01:19:15.233
Not to mention,

01:19:15.233 --> 01:19:16.713
when he went easy on
Henry at the gun range.

01:19:17.975 --> 01:19:19.411
What are you saying, John?

01:19:22.414 --> 01:19:24.765
Is Tobin the man he once was?

01:19:26.767 --> 01:19:27.985
Victor?

01:19:27.985 --> 01:19:29.987
So is that what he's doing now?

01:19:31.684 --> 01:19:33.338
Creating an army?

01:19:34.426 --> 01:19:37.952
You've got a problem.

01:19:39.344 --> 01:19:41.956
You don't know how powerful you
are!

01:19:43.696 --> 01:19:44.959
But it's not your fault!

01:19:46.090 --> 01:19:47.483
And you have no one to blame,

01:19:47.483 --> 01:19:49.311
so you blame yourself!

01:19:50.181 --> 01:19:53.184
I'm sorry, Tobin doesn't
want you in the program.

01:19:55.447 --> 01:19:57.188
I'm done talking about this.

01:19:58.189 --> 01:20:00.148
I don't know shit about what
he's doing.

01:20:01.889 --> 01:20:02.759
Starting...

01:20:04.630 --> 01:20:05.936
An army.

01:20:10.071 --> 01:20:14.858
Your number one goal should
be to find your purpose!

01:20:17.556 --> 01:20:18.383
But you can't!

01:20:19.471 --> 01:20:23.301
Because first, you need
to find your enemy,

01:20:23.301 --> 01:20:25.303
identify them,

01:20:25.303 --> 01:20:27.479
so that you can rise up,

01:20:27.479 --> 01:20:28.611
and crush them!

01:20:29.960 --> 01:20:31.048
When you do that,

01:20:31.048 --> 01:20:34.530
the possibilities are endless!

01:20:34.530 --> 01:20:36.837
And you can rule the world!

01:20:40.841 --> 01:20:42.886
I said I was done talkin'
about this.

01:20:45.497 --> 01:20:47.151
And when I say I'm done, I'm
done.

01:20:48.022 --> 01:20:49.327
Got it?

01:20:49.327 --> 01:20:50.154
Got it.

01:20:50.154 --> 01:20:50.981
You got it?

01:20:50.981 --> 01:20:51.852
Got it out there?

01:20:51.852 --> 01:20:52.809
Got it here?

01:20:52.809 --> 01:20:53.636
Got it...

01:20:53.636 --> 01:20:54.463
Got it everywhere again.

01:20:57.640 --> 01:21:02.297
Now, let's talk about results.
