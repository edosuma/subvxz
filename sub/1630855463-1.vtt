The Summer I Turned Pretty...

00:08.384 --> 00:09.552
[Belly] My family's been going

00:09.635 --> 00:10.928
to Susannah's beach house
in Cousins

00:11.011 --> 00:12.805
every summer since I was a baby.

00:12.888 --> 00:14.765
Look who came back
all growed up.

00:14.849 --> 00:16.851
[Belly] Susannah told me
that when I was born

00:16.934 --> 00:19.228
she knew I was destined
for one of her boys.

00:19.311 --> 00:21.147
I always hoped
it would be Conrad.

00:21.230 --> 00:22.940
[Susannah] I wrangled Belly
an invitation

00:23.023 --> 00:25.276
to be a debutante.
Now, which one of you

00:25.359 --> 00:27.403
is gonna be Belly's escort
to the ball?

00:27.486 --> 00:28.863
[Gigi] Uh, so,
are you and Jeremiah

00:28.946 --> 00:30.656

[Nicole] They're like
basically related.

00:32.616 --> 00:33.534

with either of you.

00:33.617 --> 00:35.202
I am going to find my own date.

00:35.286 --> 00:36.954
I don't know what to think
about you this summer.

00:37.037 --> 00:39.832
You have new friends, you have
a boyfriend. I don't even know

00:39.915 --> 00:41.876
- who you are anymore.
- Is that why you threw yourself
on my brother?

00:41.959 --> 00:43.794
So that you could get back
at me?

00:43.878 --> 00:45.087
My heart's beating really fast.

00:45.171 --> 00:46.172
You're having a panic attack.

00:46.255 --> 00:47.923
It's my mom.

00:48.007 --> 00:49.884
I know you said you didn't
want to do chemo, but...

00:49.967 --> 00:51.552
I'm not putting myself
through treatment again.

00:51.635 --> 00:54.138
I'm gonna tell the kids
when we get back to Boston.

00:54.221 --> 00:57.099
Why are you acting so different?
I mean, something's going on.

00:57.183 --> 00:58.893
- Just tell me.
- [Conrad] Belly,
I think about you.

00:58.976 --> 01:02.229

I just can't.

01:02.313 --> 01:03.481

still beats for his brother?
