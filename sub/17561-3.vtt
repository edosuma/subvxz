00:03.878 --> 00:05.630
It was so simple, Tina.

00:05.714 --> 00:07.090
Vince called, and he said

00:07.173 --> 00:09.050
"Hey, I've got tickets
to the Knicks tonight."

00:09.134 --> 00:10.218
And I said, "That's so cool."

00:10.301 --> 00:11.302
And he said,
"I'll see you later."

[gasps]
Do you know what this is, Tina?

00:14.097 --> 00:17.016
The most boring story
I've ever heard?

00:17.100 --> 00:19.894
No, it's our first official date
as a couple.

00:19.978 --> 00:22.105
Oh, don't you feel
the excitement?

00:22.188 --> 00:24.983
I mean, this is gonna be
our first time.

00:25.066 --> 00:26.609
Holly, there's only
one first time

00:26.693 --> 00:27.777
I really want to hear about.

00:27.861 --> 00:29.237
I just hope
I still have my hearing

00:29.320 --> 00:31.114
by the time that happens.

00:31.197 --> 00:34.159
Tina, I know this must be
really hard for you

00:34.242 --> 00:36.035
because Vince and I are going
through the transition

00:36.119 --> 00:39.372
from friends to more than,
but you have to know

00:39.456 --> 00:41.249
that I will always
be there for..

00:41.332 --> 00:44.127
Vince! My boyfriend,
Vince, is here!

00:44.210 --> 00:45.503
Oh, there's my baby.

00:45.587 --> 00:47.505
Whoo-hoo! Knicks!

You see that, Tina? Vince and I
kiss when we see each other now.

Baby, we got to go.
We don't want to be late.

01:01.060 --> 01:02.979
Yeah, your ass has to soak up
every second

01:03.062 --> 01:04.480
of those sweet-ass seats.

01:04.563 --> 01:07.150

Oh!

01:08.193 --> 01:09.819
Okay, we gotta go.

I get to kiss my girlfriend

We might as well have some fun.

The part where
he asked you to go.

Why didn't he ask me to go?

it would have been so simple.

go hire some strange contractor

Nothing is free.

09:29.110 --> 09:30.695
You wanna know what I think?

09:30.778 --> 09:31.946
- No.
- Well.

09:32.029 --> 09:33.322
I think that you are

09:33.406 --> 09:35.449
totally attracted to him
and it's scaring

09:35.533 --> 09:37.243
the hell out of you.

09:37.326 --> 09:38.953
Oh, please.

09:39.036 --> 09:41.247
'Look at him, all ripply.'

09:41.330 --> 09:43.666
How much time do you think he
wastes at the gym every day?

09:43.749 --> 09:47.211
- Get a life, buddy.
- Okay, fine.

09:47.295 --> 09:49.088
Tell him you don't want him
working here, but then

09:49.171 --> 09:52.133
he's totally gonna know
that you're attracted to him.

09:52.216 --> 09:54.093
That's a double "ooh."

09:54.176 --> 09:56.220
Okay, you're annoying.

09:58.180 --> 10:00.224
[sighs]
Listen, mister.

10:00.308 --> 10:01.684
I am not attracted to you,
okay?

10:01.767 --> 10:03.853
So, I have no problem
with you being here.

10:03.936 --> 10:05.688
If you want the job, you got it.

10:07.273 --> 10:09.984
Hi, uh, you should know
if you're gonna be working here

10:10.067 --> 10:11.777
that I do the company physicals.

10:11.861 --> 10:14.280
So I'm gonna need you to turn
your head and cough.

10:16.449 --> 10:18.492
So then, Vince said,
"Oh, I feel awful."

10:18.576 --> 10:20.202
And I said, "Oh, what?
I can't hear you.

10:20.286 --> 10:21.787
I'm at a party."

10:23.289 --> 10:25.708
I love that story, it gets
better every time you tell it.

10:25.791 --> 10:28.085
I know, well, it's a good story.

10:28.169 --> 10:29.712
And the game's over
in like two hours.

10:29.795 --> 10:31.505
You know, we gotta get out
of here before Vince gets back.

10:31.589 --> 10:33.132
He has to think you're
still at that party.

10:33.215 --> 10:34.800
Good point.
So what are we gonna do?

10:34.884 --> 10:38.512
I know what's New York City.
We can do whatever we want.

10:38.596 --> 10:41.432
Wanna go to a 24-hour drugstore
and smell hair products?

10:41.515 --> 10:42.892
Yes.

10:44.018 --> 10:45.686
[door closes]

10:45.770 --> 10:46.937
What was that?

10:47.021 --> 10:49.065
- 'Holly?'
- Oh, my God, it's Vince!

10:49.148 --> 10:50.608
What are we gonna do?
What does this mean?

10:50.691 --> 10:52.234
It means the party got raided,
and we had to come home.

10:52.318 --> 10:54.403
Because the party got raided.
Now get it together!

11:00.117 --> 11:01.369
Hey. Oh.

11:01.452 --> 11:03.746
What are you doing back
two hours early?

11:03.829 --> 11:05.289
Oh, I couldn't stay there.

11:05.373 --> 11:07.249
Couldn't stop
thinking about you.

11:07.333 --> 11:08.876
Holly, I feel terrible.

11:08.959 --> 11:11.087
So you missed like
three quarters of your game?

11:11.170 --> 11:14.090
I'm so sorry, but I didn't even
think you'd wanna go.

11:14.173 --> 11:16.550
But, I know, I know,
I still should have asked.

11:16.634 --> 11:18.928
But you do have to know
I would never do

11:19.011 --> 11:20.596
anything to hurt you.

11:22.056 --> 11:24.767
But, I mean...
you went to your game

11:24.850 --> 11:27.144
and...I went to a party.
I mean, we were even.

11:27.228 --> 11:28.771
It was all good.

11:28.854 --> 11:30.481
What do you mean we're even?

11:30.564 --> 11:32.650
I-I mean that..

11:32.733 --> 11:35.778
...you didn't <i> even</i>
have to leave the game.

11:35.861 --> 11:38.948
I mean, I really wish
you hadn't have done that.

11:39.031 --> 11:42.159
- God, now I feel so--
- Nothing. She feels nothing.

11:43.202 --> 11:45.996
No, Tina, I do feel something.

11:49.208 --> 11:51.544
Listen, Vince,
I didn't go to a party.

11:51.627 --> 11:53.462
I made it up, and you were
supposed to feel a little bad

11:53.546 --> 11:56.966
but you felt a lot bad,
and, oh, God, I lied to you

11:57.049 --> 11:59.135
and now I feel awful.

12:00.302 --> 12:01.429
There.

12:01.512 --> 12:02.805
I said it.

12:02.888 --> 12:05.099
Oh, I feel so much better.

12:05.182 --> 12:07.268
So you hurt me on purpose?

12:08.894 --> 12:10.938
Only 'cause you hurt me first.

12:11.021 --> 12:12.690
Mine was an accident.

12:12.773 --> 12:14.650
Listen, Vince.
I was gonna tell you before.

12:14.733 --> 12:16.777
But I was so mad,
and I didn't want to be

12:16.861 --> 12:19.155
one of those, you know, annoying

12:19.238 --> 12:21.782
crazy girlfriends, so..

12:21.866 --> 12:23.159
...you know, I didn't tell you.

12:23.242 --> 12:24.660
But we just got together

12:24.743 --> 12:27.163
and I didn't wanna
ruin our relationship.

12:27.246 --> 12:28.497
What's that, Holly?

12:28.581 --> 12:31.542
I can't hear you.
I'm at a party.

12:37.256 --> 12:40.259
So...you don't wanna go
smell hair products now?

12:43.929 --> 12:46.682
[instrumental music]

12:53.397 --> 12:54.440
Are you still playing poker?

12:54.523 --> 12:55.816
You've doing that
for like an hour.

12:55.900 --> 12:58.444
Oh, no. I stopped playing poker
45 minutes ago.

12:58.527 --> 13:00.529
I met a guy. We're talking.

13:01.947 --> 13:04.033
Talking?
You don't even know this guy.

13:04.116 --> 13:05.784
- He could be a pervert.
- Val.

13:05.868 --> 13:08.746
Why do you always have
to go to the dirty place?

13:08.829 --> 13:11.540
'Cause that's where you live.

13:11.624 --> 13:12.791
For your information

13:12.875 --> 13:16.170
sex in any shape or form
has not even come up.

13:16.253 --> 13:19.298
Yeah, we were talking about how
we both love our birthdays.

13:19.381 --> 13:21.634
How we both hate touching
the strap on the subway.

13:21.717 --> 13:24.803
How we both got choked up
during that penguin movie.

13:24.887 --> 13:28.224
Oh, God.
I really hope he's not ten.

13:28.307 --> 13:29.934
Okay, boss.
Can I see you for a minute?

13:30.017 --> 13:31.936
I need a decision.

13:37.358 --> 13:40.110
Please,
just state your business.

13:40.194 --> 13:41.820
What do you think about
doing a tin ceiling?

13:41.904 --> 13:44.156
No. No, no, no.
I wanna flat white ceiling.

13:44.240 --> 13:46.700
I don't want anything except..

13:46.784 --> 13:48.744
...that.

13:48.827 --> 13:51.956
- That would look incredible.
- Mmm-hmm.

13:52.039 --> 13:53.457
Except it's gonna need
a molding

13:53.541 --> 13:55.084
and I'm very particular
about my moldings.

13:55.167 --> 13:58.003
Ask anybody,
I don't like any kind but..

13:58.087 --> 13:59.922
...that kind.

14:00.005 --> 14:01.757
Oh, that-that I love.

14:01.840 --> 14:04.051
- Yeah, and we could just--
- Distress it.

14:06.929 --> 14:10.140
Well, you do have some
nifty ideas, don't you?

14:11.517 --> 14:12.977
Okay, so go ahead and get to it.

14:13.060 --> 14:14.812
This constructions
hurting my business.

14:14.895 --> 14:16.564
Uh, okay, you know what,
I could go a lot faster

14:16.647 --> 14:19.358
if I had an extra
set of hands helping.

14:19.441 --> 14:20.693
No, no, no.

14:20.776 --> 14:23.320
These are baking hands,
not building hands.

14:23.404 --> 14:25.614
Okay, I mean, well,
you do want me out of here

14:25.698 --> 14:27.992
right...for business?

14:28.742 --> 14:30.244
Yes, I do.

14:31.036 --> 14:33.122
Okay. Good. Come on.

14:33.205 --> 14:35.165
First thing we're gonna do
is nail down this countertop.

14:35.249 --> 14:36.750
Alright? Now, you see the stud?

14:36.834 --> 14:38.961
You are so into you.

14:39.044 --> 14:42.047
No, Val, this-this here
is the stud.

14:43.382 --> 14:45.259
My bad.

14:45.342 --> 14:46.844
Go ahead. Give it a shot.

14:46.927 --> 14:49.471
Go on.

14:49.555 --> 14:51.807
[chuckles]

14:51.890 --> 14:53.976
That was, that was nowhere
near the nail, alright?

14:54.059 --> 14:56.020
And you-you're holding it
all wrong.

14:56.103 --> 14:57.229
You're gonna hurt yourself.
Come here.

14:57.313 --> 14:59.607
Let me help. Let me help.
Come here.

14:59.690 --> 15:01.900
Just..

15:02.860 --> 15:04.111
Good. You ready?

15:04.194 --> 15:05.821
- Mm-hmm.
- Sure?

15:05.904 --> 15:08.032
Let's try it.

15:08.115 --> 15:09.867
There you go. That was good.

15:09.950 --> 15:12.036
That was...good.

15:12.119 --> 15:14.288
Good. Good.

15:14.371 --> 15:15.331
That's good. There you go.

15:15.414 --> 15:17.833
Get a rhythm. Now you got it.

15:17.916 --> 15:19.251
Faster. Faster.

15:19.335 --> 15:21.670
- Work it. Yes. Right!
- Wow!

15:21.754 --> 15:23.422
[banging continues]

15:25.674 --> 15:27.635
Whoo!

15:27.718 --> 15:29.261
Oh, yes!

15:31.930 --> 15:33.474
I mean, uh...that's good.

15:33.557 --> 15:35.351
I'm gonna go.

15:35.434 --> 15:37.728
[instrumental music]

15:40.564 --> 15:42.566
[instrumental music]

15:50.115 --> 15:52.326
Okay.

15:52.409 --> 15:53.369
I'm attracted to you.

15:53.452 --> 15:55.162
There. You happy?

15:55.245 --> 15:58.040
I think you're hot.
Hot, hot, hot!

15:58.123 --> 16:00.084
You son-of-a-bitch fireman.

16:00.167 --> 16:03.003
- Val?
- Oh, Holly, hi.

16:03.087 --> 16:05.214
[laughs nervously]

16:05.297 --> 16:06.674
What are you doing?
Are you spying on me?

16:06.757 --> 16:08.342
Did you hear any of that?

16:08.425 --> 16:10.094
No, just you telling
the son-of-a-bitch fireman

16:10.177 --> 16:12.221
that you think
he's hot, hot, hot.

16:12.304 --> 16:14.515
'But I don't care.
I thought you were Vince.'

16:14.598 --> 16:17.309
Val, can I ask you something?

16:17.393 --> 16:19.061
When you and Vic got married

16:19.144 --> 16:21.522
did stuff...change?

16:22.147 --> 16:23.732
Well, yeah.

16:23.816 --> 16:25.859
The bartender changed shifts.

16:27.194 --> 16:28.737
No, what I don't understand
is what's going on

16:28.821 --> 16:30.322
with me and Vince.
It's like, I want it

16:30.406 --> 16:34.368
to work out so badly,
but I'm overthinking everything.

16:34.451 --> 16:35.911
Look, take it from me, okay?

16:35.994 --> 16:37.830
As someone who thinks
way too much

16:37.913 --> 16:39.665
and then one night,
just one night

16:39.748 --> 16:41.709
didn't think at all.

16:44.962 --> 16:46.130
Just..

16:46.213 --> 16:48.090
...find the middle, okay?

16:48.173 --> 16:50.801
That is what's healthy.
That is what's good.

16:50.884 --> 16:52.594
You'll be very happy there.

16:52.678 --> 16:54.263
Okay? Yeah. The middle.

16:54.346 --> 16:56.056
The middle's good.

16:59.184 --> 17:01.103
"Middle",
what the hell does that mean?

17:04.397 --> 17:06.108
You hang in there, fireman.

17:06.191 --> 17:08.402
She's this close.

17:10.863 --> 17:13.365
[snoring]

17:15.992 --> 17:17.661
Vince.

17:17.744 --> 17:19.621
Vince.

17:19.704 --> 17:22.750
Mmm. What took you so long?

17:25.836 --> 17:28.881
Tell me you're sorry
and give me a kiss.

17:28.964 --> 17:31.800
Man, better get your hands
off my ass.

17:34.511 --> 17:35.804
Sorry, man, I, uh..

17:35.888 --> 17:37.306
...thought you were Holly.

17:40.184 --> 17:42.644
I've been waiting for her
to come back and apologize.

17:42.728 --> 17:44.855
Oh. Well, I just saw her
in the hallway.

17:44.938 --> 17:47.024
- What's she doing?
- Pacing.

17:47.107 --> 17:48.942
That's it, just pacing?

17:49.026 --> 17:50.152
And crying.

17:50.235 --> 17:51.653
And you left her there?

17:51.737 --> 17:53.989
No. I came in here to get you.

17:54.072 --> 17:55.240
I think that
she's crying because

17:55.324 --> 17:56.325
you didn't take her
to that game.

17:56.408 --> 17:57.367
You know, you're not being

17:57.451 --> 17:59.369
a very considerate boyfriend.

18:05.918 --> 18:07.586
Oh.

18:09.046 --> 18:10.380
[door opens]

18:11.673 --> 18:12.883
What's wrong with you?

18:12.966 --> 18:15.427
So much.

18:15.511 --> 18:17.262
I've been waiting
on the terrace for two hours

18:17.346 --> 18:18.514
for you to apologize.

18:18.597 --> 18:20.265
I was gonna come
apologize to you before

18:20.349 --> 18:21.975
but I thought that
you needed time to cool off.

18:22.059 --> 18:24.436
And, you know, also I thought
maybe I'd wait till the morning.

18:24.520 --> 18:26.939
But then I really tried to find
this middle thing--

18:27.022 --> 18:28.565
What the hell is going on?

18:28.649 --> 18:30.442
What happened to the girl
who used to come

18:30.526 --> 18:32.069
yell at me every five minutes.

18:32.152 --> 18:34.238
The girl who used to tell me
exactly how she felt

18:34.321 --> 18:35.781
exactly how I felt.

18:35.864 --> 18:39.368
The-the girl who didn't question
every move she made?

18:39.451 --> 18:42.329
I miss her. She was delightful.

18:42.412 --> 18:44.373
I miss her, too.

18:44.456 --> 18:46.917
I think she left town
when you and I started dating.

18:47.000 --> 18:49.670
I mean...if you forgive her

18:49.753 --> 18:52.464
I could probably get her back.

18:52.548 --> 18:53.715
Get her back.

18:53.799 --> 18:54.967
Do you forgive her?

18:55.050 --> 18:56.260
I forgive her!

18:56.343 --> 18:57.803
Oh!

18:59.596 --> 19:02.558
Why was it so much easier
when we were friends?

19:02.641 --> 19:04.852
Vince...the only reason
it got complicated

19:04.935 --> 19:06.645
is because
I wasn't honest with you.

19:06.728 --> 19:09.064
Hmm. We both got weird
with the whole changeover.

19:09.147 --> 19:10.399
- I know.
- Yeah.

19:10.482 --> 19:11.692
We need to ease up
on each other.

19:11.775 --> 19:13.151
Go back to saying
whatever we want to say.

19:13.235 --> 19:14.653
Like if we're mad at each other,
we tell each other?

19:14.736 --> 19:16.029
If we love each other,
we tell each other.

19:16.113 --> 19:17.364
If we want to have sex
with each other?

19:17.447 --> 19:19.575
- We tell each other. Deal.
- Deal.

19:19.658 --> 19:22.411
I think it's finally time
we had sex with each other.

19:22.494 --> 19:24.454
- Not yet.
- Yeah.

19:26.164 --> 19:28.417
But soon.

19:28.500 --> 19:30.669
Hmm?

19:30.752 --> 19:33.005
- See you in the morning?
- See you in the morning.

19:35.883 --> 19:37.217
I love you.

19:37.301 --> 19:39.428
I know. I know.

19:39.511 --> 19:41.722
I love you, too, Boo.

20:00.449 --> 20:02.492
Oh, my God.

20:03.827 --> 20:06.330
Even his chicken
is lean and delicious.

[doorknob rattling]

20:13.378 --> 20:15.839
- Baby, I'm home.
- Hey.

20:17.966 --> 20:21.136
- What are you eatin'?
- Mmm. Nothing.

[sniffs]

20:25.891 --> 20:27.392
I smell chicken.

20:29.645 --> 20:31.271
Don't know why.

20:31.355 --> 20:34.232
Well, maybe 'cause
it's still in the fridge.

20:34.316 --> 20:36.610
Okay. I'm gonna
go grab a shower.

20:36.693 --> 20:38.320
You do that.

20:44.493 --> 20:46.536
I'm in trouble.

20:50.958 --> 20:52.918
