00:02.435 --> 00:03.569
Good morning, Lemon.

00:03.637 --> 00:05.238
Ugh. I hate January.

00:05.304 --> 00:06.905
It's dark and freezing,

00:06.973 --> 00:08.508
and everyone's wearing bulky coats.

00:08.574 --> 00:10.575
You can do some serious subway flirting

00:10.644 --> 00:12.062
before you realize the guy is homeless.

00:14.840 --> 00:16.131
Work is awful.

00:16.199 --> 00:18.295
Everyone's snippy and tense.

00:18.364 --> 00:20.191
Well, the lack of sun
makes people depressed.

00:20.259 --> 00:22.189
It's called seasonal affective disorder.

00:22.256 --> 00:25.012
Oh, is that where
the word "sad" comes from?

00:25.047 --> 00:27.107
What?
You think "sad" is an acronym

00:27.173 --> 00:28.374
invented by psychologists?

00:28.440 --> 00:30.677
I've been stuck inside
playing online boggle.

00:30.744 --> 00:31.984
It's messing with my head.

00:32.054 --> 00:34.688
Star, rats, arts, tars.

00:37.027 --> 00:38.528
It's from Nancy.

00:38.597 --> 00:41.802
She said she's in line
behind the female Larry Bird.

00:41.871 --> 00:42.803
Oh, God.

00:42.871 --> 00:44.071
There's a photo.

00:44.138 --> 00:45.371
Oh, come on.

00:45.440 --> 00:47.777
How is female Larry Bird
holding hands with a guy?

00:47.844 --> 00:49.246
What am I doing wrong?

00:50.316 --> 00:51.716
What's that for?

00:51.784 --> 00:53.820
I'm telling Nancy that
I'm with female Kevin McHale.

00:53.888 --> 00:55.857
So what's going on
with you and Nancy, anyway?

00:55.925 --> 00:58.194
We're just friends.
It's platonic.

00:58.262 --> 00:59.330
I have elaborate fantasies

00:59.398 --> 01:01.264
of her husband dying in a boat explosion.

01:01.332 --> 01:03.199
But she's getting divorced, right?

01:03.266 --> 01:04.434
Well, she hasn't mentioned it.

01:04.501 --> 01:05.602
It's not the sort of thing

01:05.671 --> 01:07.371
you discuss by text or email.

01:07.439 --> 01:09.538
Well, this is my stop.

01:09.606 --> 01:12.876
Stop. Pots.
Tops. Opts. Post.

01:12.944 --> 01:14.044
Morning, Kenneth.

01:14.113 --> 01:15.447
Good morning, Miss Lemon.

01:15.515 --> 01:16.647
I'm sorry.

01:16.715 --> 01:18.682
I didn't mean to snap at you.

01:18.749 --> 01:21.218
I've got winter madness.

01:21.285 --> 01:23.954
Lutz, do the right thing.

01:24.022 --> 01:25.355
What's going on?

01:25.424 --> 01:27.257
It's Lutz's turn
to pick where we eat today.

01:27.324 --> 01:29.226
Oh, boy.
Lutz, don't do this.

01:29.294 --> 01:30.863
It's my turn to pick.

01:30.929 --> 01:32.296
I'm the picker.

01:32.364 --> 01:33.931
Lutz, look at me.

01:33.999 --> 01:35.466
It's a long year.

01:35.533 --> 01:36.701
Think of the group.

01:36.767 --> 01:38.702
- Subway.
- I hope you die!

01:38.771 --> 01:41.272
Are you out of your mind?

01:41.340 --> 01:43.075
Whoa, you guys.
Calm down.

01:43.143 --> 01:45.378
I know we're all tired and cranky,

01:45.445 --> 01:47.947
but we just got to get
to the end of the season.

01:48.015 --> 01:49.315
And, hey, who knows?

01:49.383 --> 01:52.787
Maybe some people
won't be coming back next year.

01:52.855 --> 01:55.123
I don't care.
Worth it.

01:55.190 --> 01:56.891
I hate the new guy.

01:56.958 --> 01:57.925
Loser.

Hey, Jack.

Octopus.

02:28.817 --> 02:29.749
Nancy, I'm sorry.

02:29.818 --> 02:30.885
The audio's bad.

02:30.952 --> 02:32.752
Jonathan, why do I have
an Indian assistant

02:32.820 --> 02:33.787
if my computer is always...

02:33.853 --> 02:34.921
Jack.

02:34.988 --> 02:35.921
I'm messing with you.

02:35.988 --> 02:38.657
Oh, very funny, Donna.
The...

02:38.724 --> 02:41.795
Aw, the computer froze.

02:41.861 --> 02:44.364
Nice.

02:44.432 --> 02:46.634
So, uh...

02:46.703 --> 02:48.002
To what do I owe the pleasure?

02:48.071 --> 02:50.539
I wanted to tell you
I'm coming down to New York.

02:50.606 --> 02:51.640
Oh, really?
When?

02:51.709 --> 02:53.775
June 5th.
For my son's graduation.

02:53.843 --> 02:56.111
So five months from now.

02:56.179 --> 02:57.445
Okay.

02:57.513 --> 03:00.481
Well, maybe you'll
come up here before then?

03:00.550 --> 03:02.551
Well, my 25th reunion

03:02.619 --> 03:05.219
from Harvard Business School
is...

03:05.288 --> 03:06.388
June 5th.

03:07.455 --> 03:10.123
That's too bad.

03:10.191 --> 03:11.592
Well, I should go.

03:11.660 --> 03:13.494
I got to scrape the icicles
off the gutters.

03:13.562 --> 03:14.495
I'm tired of waking up

03:14.563 --> 03:16.297
to a porch full of dead squirrels.

03:16.365 --> 03:18.632
God, I miss Boston.

03:18.701 --> 03:21.702
See ya.

03:21.770 --> 03:22.870
Liz, I have an idea.

03:22.938 --> 03:24.572
Something to boost morale.

03:24.639 --> 03:25.572
Pete, no.

03:25.640 --> 03:26.707
I listened to you

03:26.775 --> 03:28.008
when you wanted to take the staff

03:28.076 --> 03:29.376
to see that "R" rated hypnotist,

03:29.444 --> 03:30.478
and that sucked.

03:30.545 --> 03:32.079
He was pretty bad.

03:32.148 --> 03:35.082
Nutmeg.

03:35.149 --> 03:40.020
Rodeo, rodeo, rodeo.

03:40.088 --> 03:41.989
Look, I think we can take
the show to Miami for a week.

03:42.057 --> 03:43.925
What?
Can we afford to do that?

03:43.991 --> 03:45.758
If we do it on the cheap,
double up rooms.

03:45.827 --> 03:47.327
Think about it, Liz.
Florida.

03:47.395 --> 03:48.628
I can rent a convertible,

03:48.697 --> 03:50.597
You can complain about the heat
with elderly people.

03:50.664 --> 03:54.100
I can sell this to Jack.

03:54.167 --> 03:55.535
Cross promotional,

03:55.602 --> 03:57.003
Deal mechanics,

03:57.070 --> 03:58.337
Revenue streams,

03:58.404 --> 03:59.805
Jargon,

03:59.873 --> 04:03.276
Synergy.

04:03.342 --> 04:05.243
That's the best presentation
I've ever seen.

04:05.311 --> 04:07.046
Get started right away.

04:07.113 --> 04:08.446
Whoo!

04:08.515 --> 04:10.016
One little thing.

04:10.083 --> 04:12.384
Instead of Miami, make it Boston.

04:12.452 --> 04:14.686
But I... I bought a parrot shirt.

04:16.923 --> 04:18.591
Whoo! Okay.

04:18.659 --> 04:19.926
Exciting news, guys.

04:19.993 --> 04:24.463
This week, <i>TGS</i> is going on
the ♪ road ♪

04:25.932 --> 04:27.832
There's a rumor
that it's Miami. Is it Miami?

04:27.900 --> 04:28.834
Close.

04:28.901 --> 04:31.468
It is a city with an NBA team.

04:31.537 --> 04:33.103
And even though Will Smith

04:33.170 --> 04:35.138
never wrote any raps about it,

04:35.205 --> 04:39.375
the poet Robert Lowell lived there.

04:39.443 --> 04:40.543
Okay, we're going to Boston.

04:40.610 --> 04:41.744
No one's happy about it.

04:41.812 --> 04:43.279
Oh, it's freezing there.

04:43.346 --> 04:44.814
No, no, no, it's gonna be fun.

04:44.883 --> 04:46.382
How?
Their bars close at 2:00.

04:46.449 --> 04:49.617
You know, I went to college in Boston.

04:49.685 --> 04:52.185
Well, not in Boston, but nearby.

04:52.253 --> 04:53.421
No, not tufts...

04:53.487 --> 04:55.821
Shut up.
It's 14 degrees up there.

04:55.890 --> 04:57.623
How is that supposed
to make us feel better?

04:57.690 --> 04:59.660
- Harvard.
- You have been told to shut up.

04:59.726 --> 05:01.461
Come on. Silver lining.

05:01.528 --> 05:03.896
It's a fun vacation on the show's dime.

05:03.963 --> 05:05.498
FYI, to pay for this vacation,

05:05.565 --> 05:06.933
we need to cut some corners,

05:07.000 --> 05:08.833
so we sill be doubling up hotel rooms,

05:08.902 --> 05:10.736
and we are going by bus.

05:10.803 --> 05:12.070
By bus?

05:12.139 --> 05:13.838
Also, there is no
Spectravision or Internet

05:13.905 --> 05:14.905
in the hotel,

05:14.973 --> 05:16.975
So plan ahead, gentlemen, porn-wise.

05:22.215 --> 05:24.416
Did Pete just say
we're doubling up rooms?

05:24.484 --> 05:25.418
Did he?

05:25.486 --> 05:26.819
Oh, this is the worst.

05:26.886 --> 05:28.788
Well, what if, uh,
you and I room together?

05:28.854 --> 05:31.289
Oh, no. Toofer and I
already talked about it.

05:31.357 --> 05:33.190
You can't have talked about it!

05:33.260 --> 05:35.327
You just said
you didn't even know about it.

05:35.395 --> 05:37.561
You think I like sharing
a room with Toofer?

05:37.629 --> 05:39.898
Dude is still playing that Obama song.

05:39.965 --> 05:44.035
And yeah, I know you're standing there!

05:44.103 --> 05:46.470
Hey, fellas, we're
getting Tracy his own room,

05:46.539 --> 05:47.839
So I assume you two will pair up?

05:47.907 --> 05:49.909
Why would you just assume
we would room together?

05:49.975 --> 05:51.277
Why would he assume we wouldn't?

05:51.343 --> 05:52.743
I don't know.
Maybe because one of us

05:52.811 --> 05:54.445
still hasn't read
the other's screenplay.

05:54.513 --> 05:55.580
I read it.

05:55.648 --> 05:57.648
I just didn't like it.

06:00.185 --> 06:03.421
Hey, Cerie, I thought
you and I could be roommates.

06:03.489 --> 06:06.190
Go out, meet guys,
share clothes like twinsies.

06:06.260 --> 06:07.459
What size are you?

06:07.527 --> 06:09.129
Usually designers
just make clothes for me,

06:09.196 --> 06:11.731
But when I do buy stuff,
I'm a child's medium.

06:11.799 --> 06:13.900
Well, I only wear designer labels.

06:13.967 --> 06:15.701
These are Jamie Foxx for assfarm.

06:15.770 --> 06:16.803
But I can't room with you.

06:16.872 --> 06:18.306
Sue and I already talked about it.

06:18.374 --> 06:21.208
Why? You know sue says stuff
about you behind your back.

06:21.275 --> 06:22.743
She always says stuff to me about you.

06:22.811 --> 06:23.742
Wait, what?

06:23.811 --> 06:25.144
I was making my thing up.

06:25.212 --> 06:27.046
You bitch!

06:27.113 --> 06:28.981
What did you tell her, you vondruke?

06:29.049 --> 06:31.549
Liz Lemon,
I can't go to Boston.

06:31.617 --> 06:33.218
Oh, Tracy, come on.

06:33.285 --> 06:34.388
You don't understand.

06:34.453 --> 06:36.421
I get in trouble on the road.

06:36.489 --> 06:37.555

06:40.325 --> 06:41.359

06:43.261 --> 06:45.428

- Hello.

The road is a minefield, L.L.

and new temptations?

06:49.767 --> 06:51.133
Yeah, I don't know
what to tell you.

06:51.200 --> 06:52.466
This Boston thing
is Jack's idea.

06:52.535 --> 06:55.003

What, are you not using
an office-replication service

07:43.338 --> 07:44.439
while we're here in Boston?

07:44.506 --> 07:45.506
Is it identical?

07:45.575 --> 07:47.673
Not quite.

07:47.741 --> 07:49.675
Seven items are different.

07:49.743 --> 07:52.110
See if you can spot which ones.

07:54.647 --> 07:56.448
So how's the show looking for Friday?

07:56.516 --> 07:58.683
Like it may not happen, actually.

07:58.752 --> 08:00.652
Oh, that'll really disappoint
your key demographic

08:00.721 --> 08:01.853
of drunken 11-year-olds.

08:01.921 --> 08:03.890
Look, I know for you
this is all just a way

08:03.958 --> 08:05.792
to meet married ladies,
but it is my job.

08:05.859 --> 08:06.959
Let me give you some advice

08:07.026 --> 08:08.627
on uniting a dividing people...

08:08.694 --> 08:10.330
Find a common enemy.

08:10.397 --> 08:11.432
A common enemy?

08:11.498 --> 08:12.531
For example,

08:12.598 --> 08:14.199
What keeps people polite on airplanes?

08:14.266 --> 08:16.467
A shared hatred of the CBS sitcoms

08:16.535 --> 08:17.635
They're forced to watch.

08:17.702 --> 08:19.036
No,
I understand the concept,

08:19.104 --> 08:20.405
Because with these dummies,

08:20.472 --> 08:22.840
The common enemy is always me.
And I'm sick of it.

08:22.908 --> 08:24.342
I'm not gonna be the bad guy this time.

08:24.411 --> 08:26.211
Then find someone else.
I recommend Lutz.

08:26.278 --> 08:28.113
Why do I always
want to choke that guy?

08:28.182 --> 08:29.814
You just do.
But that is not...

08:29.883 --> 08:30.816
Am I interrupting?

08:30.885 --> 08:33.621
Of course not.

08:33.687 --> 08:35.354
- Oh.
- Oh.

08:40.193 --> 08:42.395
You're not a part of this, Liz.

08:44.565 --> 08:46.331
Why didn't you tell me
you were coming up here?

08:46.399 --> 08:47.767
I wanted it to be a surprise.

08:47.834 --> 08:49.103
And I hope that you
and of course Mark

08:49.170 --> 08:50.404
will come to the show on Friday.

08:50.472 --> 08:51.573
I can't believe

08:51.639 --> 08:53.041
I'm in the same building
as <i>Bruins Beat.</i>

08:53.107 --> 08:55.407
- Come on. Give me a tour.
- Of course.

08:55.475 --> 08:57.476
Ooh, actually I'm gonna tag along.

08:57.543 --> 09:00.411
I still haven't had a formal
tour of the facility.

09:00.479 --> 09:03.781
So I'm gonna...
Stay here.

09:03.851 --> 09:05.217
Why the long face?

09:05.284 --> 09:07.252
Your boss there
making your life miserable?

09:07.319 --> 09:08.753
It's complicated, Sean.

09:08.822 --> 09:09.921
Yeah, I know what it's like.

09:09.988 --> 09:12.557
I'm the head writer
at <i>Bruins Beat.</i>

09:12.625 --> 09:14.527
Trying to have it all...

09:14.594 --> 09:17.063
It's wicked hard.

09:19.333 --> 09:21.367
Is this where they do the news?

09:21.435 --> 09:23.037
It's small, isn't it?

09:23.104 --> 09:25.104
I find that news anchors and breasts

09:25.174 --> 09:27.373
are always smaller than they look on TV.

09:27.441 --> 09:28.607
You can try it.

09:28.675 --> 09:32.277
Feel like Chet Curtis
and Natalie Jacobson.

09:32.345 --> 09:34.480
Tonight's top story,

09:34.547 --> 09:35.647
A Worcester man accused

09:35.715 --> 09:37.616
of trading his foster son for gasoline.

09:37.684 --> 09:38.852
And later in the hour,

09:38.919 --> 09:41.186
Ten tips on how to make
your cat's birthday

09:41.254 --> 09:43.022
go purr-fectly.

09:43.089 --> 09:45.857
Back to you, Nat.

09:45.925 --> 09:47.359
Nancy, are you okay?

09:47.426 --> 09:48.561
Oh, God.

09:48.628 --> 09:52.598
I swore I wasn't
gonna cry in front of you.

09:52.666 --> 09:53.866
Mark left.

09:53.933 --> 09:56.368
Yesterday.
He took a job in New Orleans.

09:56.436 --> 09:58.370
What?
What about his roofing company?

09:58.437 --> 10:00.440
Apparently Brad Pitt and Sharon Stone

10:00.506 --> 10:02.574
did a crap job rebuilding
those Katrina homes,

10:02.641 --> 10:04.743
and Mark thinks he can make
a fortune down there.

10:04.812 --> 10:06.244
But I know the real reason he left.

10:06.312 --> 10:09.115
He wants to force me to be
the one to ask for the divorce.

10:09.182 --> 10:11.282
So you guys are having problems?
I'm sorry.

10:11.351 --> 10:13.018
Oh, Jack, it's a mess.

10:13.085 --> 10:14.986
Suddenly he has his own bank account.

10:15.054 --> 10:17.190
We've had our house
on the market for a year,

10:17.257 --> 10:19.992
and neither one of us
know what to do about the dog,

10:20.061 --> 10:21.261
'cause we both hate it.

10:21.327 --> 10:22.894
Have you talked openly about divorce?

10:22.962 --> 10:24.831
Yeah, we talked to Dr. Phil,

10:24.898 --> 10:27.533
and then we made a collage
in our dream journals.

10:27.602 --> 10:28.533
No.

10:28.602 --> 10:29.768
You know how it is up here.

10:29.836 --> 10:30.770
People don't talk.

10:30.837 --> 10:32.136
They just run off to New Orleans

10:32.205 --> 10:35.107
And jump on that B.S. Saints bandwagon.

10:35.174 --> 10:36.941
Go pats.

10:37.008 --> 10:40.110
Oh, Donovan, I hate seeing you like this.

10:40.178 --> 10:41.745
Well, I... I got to get going.

10:41.813 --> 10:43.480
I... I got an open house tomorrow,

10:43.549 --> 10:45.050
and Mark was supposed
to shovel the walk

10:45.117 --> 10:46.184
and salt the carport.

10:46.252 --> 10:47.720
I can barely understand you,

10:47.787 --> 10:48.954
but let me help while I'm here.

10:49.022 --> 10:50.790
Do you know how to rewire a doorbell?

10:50.857 --> 10:53.861
I do if you can resuscitate
an electrocuted person.

10:53.927 --> 10:57.329
Can you wire the doorbell to the dog?

10:57.397 --> 10:58.731
Okay, that's lunch.

10:58.799 --> 11:00.834
Dude, why do you keep
fixing my spelling?

11:00.903 --> 11:02.036
We're back in at 3:00.

11:02.105 --> 11:04.840
No, 3:30.

11:04.907 --> 11:06.575
Enjoy the town, everyone.

11:06.642 --> 11:07.775
You're welcome.

11:07.844 --> 11:09.344
Now who would like to join me

11:09.411 --> 11:11.113
on a morale-boosting tour

11:11.180 --> 11:13.915
of Boston's historic freedom trail?

11:13.983 --> 11:15.684
Ooh, I would...

11:15.751 --> 11:17.653
N't.

11:17.720 --> 11:18.955
Now what am I supposed to do?

11:19.021 --> 11:20.689
I got free time in a strange city.

11:20.757 --> 11:22.724
Why don't you come on
the freedom trail with me?

11:22.792 --> 11:24.694
It's an educational walking tour.

11:24.761 --> 11:25.826
Purr-fect!

11:25.895 --> 11:27.494
Like a cat birthday.

11:27.563 --> 11:30.563
How could I possibly get
in trouble on a walking tour?

11:30.630 --> 11:32.397
Smash-cut to...

11:32.465 --> 11:34.801
And I, John Hancock,

11:34.869 --> 11:36.969
With one stroke of my pen,

11:37.035 --> 11:39.536
set all Americans free.

11:39.604 --> 11:41.842
You lying, white devil!

11:41.907 --> 11:43.575
The only people you set free

11:43.642 --> 11:46.145
were rich, white dudes like yourself!

11:46.213 --> 11:49.248
I think my good friend
and supervisor Paul Revere

11:49.317 --> 11:50.415
can address that.

11:50.483 --> 11:51.916
I'm out, Kenny.

11:51.984 --> 11:54.051
Hey, you know what?
We're gonna go.

11:54.120 --> 11:55.353
Man, no.

11:55.421 --> 11:57.690
Most dudes that signed
that declaration of independence

11:57.756 --> 11:58.690
owned slaves!

11:58.756 --> 12:01.058
What about you, John Hancock?

12:01.125 --> 12:02.459
Well, technically,

12:02.526 --> 12:05.194
I just inherited my slaves.

12:05.262 --> 12:06.195
I knew it.

12:06.262 --> 12:07.363
For a dude that has

12:07.431 --> 12:09.566
the most hilarious last name
I ever heard,

12:09.634 --> 12:10.734
you blow.

12:10.801 --> 12:13.036
We didn't land on Plymouth Rock.

12:13.104 --> 12:15.906
Plymouth Rock landed on Mars!

12:15.973 --> 12:17.273
All right.

12:17.341 --> 12:18.674
Give it a try.

12:18.742 --> 12:21.610
'kay.

12:25.948 --> 12:27.182
Ugh.

12:27.250 --> 12:29.418
I have many other valuable skills.

12:29.485 --> 12:30.818
It'll be the new owner's problem.

12:30.888 --> 12:33.055
Just like the water heater.
And the ghost.

12:33.122 --> 12:35.224
Well, it is a buyer's market right now.

12:35.291 --> 12:37.091
I think it'll turn around
in the next year or so.

12:37.160 --> 12:38.628
Oh,
I can't wait that long.

12:38.695 --> 12:40.663
I got to sell this place
if I want to get divorced.

12:40.731 --> 12:41.831
What do you mean?

12:41.900 --> 12:43.166
Well, there's no money, Jack.

12:43.234 --> 12:44.700
If I can get some cash
out of this place,

12:44.769 --> 12:46.369
Then I can start a new life.

12:46.437 --> 12:48.139
Buy a condo in Marina Bay.

12:48.205 --> 12:51.540
Open a store for redheaded girls
to buy cosmetics...

12:51.609 --> 12:54.643
From someone who understands.

12:54.711 --> 12:57.247
So you need to sell this house
to get divorced?

12:57.314 --> 12:58.681
Basically.

12:58.750 --> 13:03.488
You looking for a country estate
in Waltham?

13:04.620 --> 13:06.822
There it is. See?

13:06.890 --> 13:08.990
Why did you even get
to pick lunch again?

13:09.058 --> 13:10.192
Because it's my birthday.

13:10.258 --> 13:11.226
And thanks for remembering.

13:11.292 --> 13:13.294
I'm 45.
It's kind of a big deal.

13:13.361 --> 13:15.396
Who orders food from a gas station?

13:15.463 --> 13:17.398
The Shell by me has good hot dogs.

13:19.700 --> 13:20.634
Guys, guys, come on.

13:20.700 --> 13:21.836
We're all in this together.

13:21.903 --> 13:23.069
Shut up, Liz.

13:23.137 --> 13:24.404
This is your fault.

13:24.472 --> 13:25.406
It's not my fault.

13:25.473 --> 13:26.639
I tried to do something nice.

13:26.707 --> 13:27.640
It was Jack...

13:27.708 --> 13:29.442
Sure, find a scapegoat.

13:29.511 --> 13:32.647
Just like John Hancock did
with the good King George.

13:32.713 --> 13:35.548
Jack made us come to Boston.

13:35.617 --> 13:36.951
This isn't about Boston.

13:37.018 --> 13:39.553
Boston was just the match
that lit the powder keg.

13:39.620 --> 13:42.423
Like the tragic events
at Lexington and Concord.

13:42.490 --> 13:43.557
- That's right.
- Yes.

13:43.625 --> 13:45.126
We are sick of the long hours,

13:45.193 --> 13:46.627
The crappy food,

13:46.696 --> 13:47.896
sharing offices with

13:47.963 --> 13:50.565
the one black guy
in New York who sucks.

13:50.632 --> 13:52.032
Getting stuck with new cast members

13:52.100 --> 13:53.199
who don't even hit on us once.

13:53.268 --> 13:54.835
Stop trying to send
dirty text messages

13:54.903 --> 13:56.035
to my land line, Jenna.

13:56.104 --> 13:57.038
And the winter.

13:57.106 --> 13:58.406
Oh, lord.

13:58.474 --> 13:59.772
The winter.

13:59.841 --> 14:01.777
Really?
You're blaming me for winter?

14:01.841 --> 14:03.676
Well, we've got to blame someone.

14:03.744 --> 14:05.210
Who's it gonna be if it's not you?

14:05.278 --> 14:06.679
You want someone to blame?

14:06.747 --> 14:10.716
I'll give you someone to blame.

14:10.783 --> 14:12.050
Dale Snitterman.

14:12.117 --> 14:14.453
Okay, I'm out.

14:14.519 --> 14:16.020
Who the hell is Dale Snitterman?

14:16.087 --> 14:18.822
Dale Snitterman is the guy at NBC

14:18.889 --> 14:21.557
who makes all the decisions
that make us unhappy.

14:21.625 --> 14:23.191
Snitterman is the one

14:23.258 --> 14:25.361
Who cancelled taco night
in the commissary.

14:25.429 --> 14:28.264
Snitterman is the one
who okayed that cast photo

14:28.332 --> 14:29.398
where your hair looks green.

14:29.466 --> 14:31.334
He's the one who keeps rejecting

14:31.404 --> 14:33.736
your "summer shorts for the pages" idea.

14:33.805 --> 14:35.172
Sounds like one of King George's

14:35.239 --> 14:36.706
hated tax collectors.

14:36.774 --> 14:39.775
Exactly.
Thank you, Tracy.

14:39.843 --> 14:41.110
You guys think I'm the bad guy?

14:41.177 --> 14:42.577
Fine. I don't care.

14:42.645 --> 14:45.514
But I fight for you every day.

14:45.581 --> 14:47.650
And if Dale Snitterman had his way,

14:47.716 --> 14:49.320
the show wouldn't even be on.

14:49.384 --> 14:50.652
That vondruke!

14:50.721 --> 14:53.889
And all we can do to get back at him

14:53.955 --> 14:56.824
is put on the best damn show that we can,

14:56.892 --> 14:58.993
and not give him the satisfaction

14:59.061 --> 15:00.994
of everybody turning on each other.

15:01.062 --> 15:02.062
Or me.

15:02.130 --> 15:03.063
Yeah.

15:03.131 --> 15:04.197
Yeah.

15:04.265 --> 15:06.733
Yeah! Yeah!

15:06.801 --> 15:08.402
I love you guys.

15:09.231 --> 15:09.231
-

15:13.523 --> 15:16.860
You wanted to see
the world's greatest manager?

15:16.929 --> 15:19.329
Is Kiyoshi Kawashima of Honda here?

15:19.397 --> 15:21.731
No, it's me.
I'm a genius.

15:21.799 --> 15:24.167
I made up a fake NBC executive

15:24.236 --> 15:26.838
and blamed everything
that has ever gone wrong on him.

15:26.905 --> 15:28.273
The imaginary enemy.

15:28.340 --> 15:30.174
Classic move, Lemon.

15:30.242 --> 15:32.843
The Salem witch trials,
the red scare, global warming.

15:32.911 --> 15:34.547
Now that you've cleaned up
your little mess,

15:34.613 --> 15:36.081
I'll need to borrow some of your people

15:36.149 --> 15:38.549
to go to an open house in Waltham for me.

15:38.617 --> 15:39.652
Charlie what now?

15:39.717 --> 15:41.252
Nancy spilled everything.

15:41.320 --> 15:42.320
Her husband left.

15:42.387 --> 15:44.521
And they're getting divorced

15:44.588 --> 15:46.155
If she can find someone
to buy their house.

15:46.222 --> 15:48.158
And that someone is you.

15:48.225 --> 15:50.059
I'm just going to be
the money man.

15:50.127 --> 15:52.061
The transaction will be
conducted by one of your staff,

15:52.129 --> 15:54.231
Who will be operating
under the alter ego

15:54.298 --> 15:56.600
Silas Marymount-Peppercorn,

15:56.667 --> 15:58.367
Uh, a name I came up with.

15:58.436 --> 15:59.669
Oh,
you should have come to me

15:59.737 --> 16:00.670
for your fake name.

16:00.737 --> 16:03.871
My executive?
Dale Snitterman.

16:03.939 --> 16:05.206
Amazing, Lemon.

16:05.274 --> 16:06.875
Where do you come up with this stuff?

16:06.943 --> 16:08.009
Well, you know,

16:08.077 --> 16:09.410
The creative process is always a mystery.

16:09.478 --> 16:10.944
I just wish I could get inside

16:11.013 --> 16:13.013
that marvelous brain of yours.

16:13.081 --> 16:14.247
Oh, wait.

16:14.316 --> 16:17.317
I can.

16:19.752 --> 16:21.453
Okay, in this instance,

16:21.521 --> 16:24.291
The creative process
was that I saw that name,

16:24.357 --> 16:25.692
forgot that I saw it,

16:25.760 --> 16:28.162
and said it later.

16:30.764 --> 16:34.402
Then, in 1754,
I graduated from university

16:34.469 --> 16:35.603
here in Boston.

16:35.669 --> 16:38.573
Well, not in Boston, but nearby.

16:38.639 --> 16:40.040
No, not tufts.

16:40.107 --> 16:41.309
Don't listen to him!

16:41.376 --> 16:43.812
We fell for his lies 300 years ago.

16:43.878 --> 16:45.745
Don't let this slave-owning
time traveler

16:45.813 --> 16:47.079
fool us again!

16:47.147 --> 16:50.615
Excuse me, John Hancock was a patriot.

16:50.683 --> 16:52.117
Then patriots are overrated.

16:52.186 --> 16:53.252
Hey!

16:53.320 --> 16:54.922
What'd you say about the patriots?

16:54.988 --> 16:56.589
I said they suck!

16:57.692 --> 16:59.460
Uh-oh.
Here come the punches.

16:59.526 --> 17:02.228
This was all Snitterman's fault.

17:05.299 --> 17:07.768
Are you here for the open house?

17:07.837 --> 17:09.103
Hello.

17:09.170 --> 17:11.472
We are here from a different
town for the open house,

17:11.540 --> 17:12.807
because we are interested

17:12.875 --> 17:14.910
in purchasing a house in this area.

17:14.977 --> 17:16.877
I'm Nancy, the owner.

17:19.981 --> 17:22.284
I am Silas Marymount-Peppercorn,

17:22.349 --> 17:24.584
And this is my first wife...

17:24.652 --> 17:25.952
Moronica.

17:26.023 --> 17:28.755
It's nice to meet you.
I'm British.

17:28.823 --> 17:32.024
My wife and I have disparate
levels of attractiveness,

17:32.092 --> 17:33.959
because I am a successful inventor.

17:34.027 --> 17:35.962
Well, I got to be honest.
I was wondering.

17:36.029 --> 17:37.130
Well, all right.

17:37.197 --> 17:38.798
It's a...
it's a three bedroom,

17:38.865 --> 17:40.501
and a partially-finished basement.

17:40.567 --> 17:41.867
Partially finished?

17:41.935 --> 17:45.372
I'll take it!

17:45.438 --> 17:47.706
Dudes, you are not gonna believe this.

17:47.774 --> 17:49.643
Snitterman is here.

17:49.710 --> 17:51.011
What?

17:51.078 --> 17:52.345
I was wandering around upstairs,

17:52.413 --> 17:54.248
Checking out the local
cleaning lady talent,

17:54.316 --> 17:56.317
And I found that
son of a bitch's office.

17:56.384 --> 17:57.350
He's in Boston?

17:57.418 --> 17:58.785
We should go up there and mess him up

17:58.854 --> 18:00.588
for all the crap he's put us through.

18:00.655 --> 18:05.057
Right, Liz?

18:05.125 --> 18:07.127
Let's get him!

18:07.194 --> 18:08.927
Yeah!

18:08.995 --> 18:10.230
Kill!

18:10.298 --> 18:11.465
Okay, don't...

18:11.533 --> 18:14.870
Oh, boy.
Okay. Oh, boy.

18:14.936 --> 18:16.370
You little bitch.

18:16.438 --> 18:17.537
- What?
- Look at you.

18:17.605 --> 18:19.239
You're just a suit.
You're nobody!

18:19.306 --> 18:21.573
I don't even know why
I was scared of this guy.

18:21.642 --> 18:23.208
Look, there must be some mistake.

18:23.276 --> 18:24.876
Don't try to explain
yourself, Snitterman.

18:24.943 --> 18:26.311
You don't talk.

18:26.379 --> 18:27.413
You don't talk at all.

18:27.481 --> 18:28.413
Aah!

18:28.481 --> 18:31.017
Hey! Hey! Hey!

18:31.084 --> 18:32.752
Okay, I think he's really scared.

18:32.820 --> 18:33.922
We've done enough here.

18:33.987 --> 18:34.921
Never.

18:34.988 --> 18:36.756
Lutz!
Truffle-shuffle him!

18:36.823 --> 18:39.994
Truffle shuffle!
Truffle shuffle!

18:40.061 --> 18:44.596
- Truffle shuffle!
- Hey, what are you...?

18:44.664 --> 18:47.065
Yeah, take that, Snitterman.

18:47.133 --> 18:49.668
That's what you get for
making us work late tonight.

18:49.735 --> 18:51.034
Yeah!

18:51.102 --> 18:53.470
We're working late tonight
because of you!

18:55.606 --> 18:56.739
So how was the open house?

18:56.807 --> 18:59.577
Well, somebody actually came, for once.

18:59.644 --> 19:01.412
Nice young couple.

19:01.480 --> 19:02.947
Weird last name, though.

19:03.014 --> 19:06.584
I'm sure your name is weird to them.

19:06.651 --> 19:09.085
Any reason to open this?
Did they make an offer?

19:09.153 --> 19:10.688
No, they didn't.

19:10.754 --> 19:12.156
Really? Are you sure?

19:12.223 --> 19:14.024
Yeah.
That house is never gonna sell.

19:14.091 --> 19:15.291
I'm gonna take it off the market

19:15.359 --> 19:16.859
And see what happens in a year or so.

19:16.928 --> 19:18.027
Well, what about your plans?

19:18.094 --> 19:20.628
The condo?
The store for pale teens?

19:20.696 --> 19:22.931
I can't run a store,
make change for people.

19:23.000 --> 19:24.399
Have another open house.

19:24.467 --> 19:25.767
I bet someone offers cash this time.

19:25.834 --> 19:27.434
Not with that broken doorbell.

19:27.505 --> 19:28.437
We'll have it fixed.

19:28.503 --> 19:29.838
I had an offer, okay?

19:29.905 --> 19:31.207
For ten grand over the asking price.

19:31.273 --> 19:32.607
So what's the problem?

19:32.674 --> 19:35.776
The problem is that I've
been married for 23 years.

19:35.844 --> 19:37.979
The dumb house
is just an excuse to stay put.

19:38.048 --> 19:40.648
You know, I'm not ready
for a new life, Jack.

19:40.717 --> 19:42.450
Not ready?
Nancy, we're 50.

19:42.518 --> 19:44.486
Yeah, and that's too old
to rush into anything.

19:44.553 --> 19:46.488
You know, you're not
from here anymore.

19:46.556 --> 19:48.090
You know, down in New York
people are like,

19:48.158 --> 19:49.524
"let's get divorced.

19:49.592 --> 19:50.927
"you marry the butler,

19:50.993 --> 19:52.427
And I'll be a gay octomom."

19:52.495 --> 19:53.762
It's different here.

19:53.828 --> 19:54.996
People judge you.

19:55.063 --> 19:56.730
Who cares what people
around here think?

19:56.798 --> 19:58.499
Your neighbors named
their daughter Belichick!

19:58.567 --> 20:00.033
I don't want
to talk about it anymore.

20:00.102 --> 20:01.535
Of course you don't want
to talk about it,

20:01.602 --> 20:03.637
- You repressed, Irish maniac.
- Don't want to talk about it.

20:03.705 --> 20:04.906
You must know that I have
feelings for you.

20:04.974 --> 20:06.341
No. Not talking.

20:06.408 --> 20:08.408
I don't want to pressure you,
but if you were divorced...

20:08.478 --> 20:10.644
No, let's go to Kelly's.
Let's get some roast beef.

20:10.711 --> 20:12.813
Nancy, let me talk.

20:15.417 --> 20:18.552
I'll give you two words.

20:18.619 --> 20:19.753
Ten.

20:19.820 --> 20:20.755
Four.

20:20.821 --> 20:21.821
Final offer.

20:21.888 --> 20:24.124
I'll wait.

20:24.191 --> 20:26.291
Not forever.

20:26.359 --> 20:28.060
I'll try.

20:28.128 --> 20:29.561
Wicked hard.

20:33.329 --> 20:33.329
-

20:35.933 --> 20:38.000
Tracy, there you are.

20:38.068 --> 20:40.437
I want you to meet
my fellow revolutionary

20:40.504 --> 20:42.438
And dear friend,
Crispus Attucks,

20:42.507 --> 20:45.741
So you can see John Hancock
has black friends.

20:45.810 --> 20:48.077
Uh-huh.
And where did you two meet?

20:48.144 --> 20:52.049
Why, we met at
the sons of liberty gathering.

20:52.116 --> 20:53.115
Uh, when was that, Crispus?

20:53.182 --> 20:55.284
1775?

20:55.351 --> 20:56.285
Really?

20:56.352 --> 20:58.286
So five years after

20:58.354 --> 21:00.922
Crispus Attucks was killed
in the Boston massacre?

21:00.989 --> 21:02.757
Run, Crispus.

21:02.827 --> 21:05.593
He... he's on to us!
