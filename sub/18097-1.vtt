We should be playing.

That's the point.

The Games used to be for all critters,
not just alpha wolves.

06:20.297 --> 06:23.926
Yeah. I did my Games with two bears,
one alpha wolf and a squirrel.

06:24.009 --> 06:26.762
- Huh. How'd that work out?
- Not so good.

06:26.845 --> 06:29.223
The alpha got hungry
and ate the squirrel.

06:29.306 --> 06:31.600
Look, you know
what our pack stands for.

Until the Games return to being
for all critters, we're taking a <i>pass.</i>

But, Dad, we're never
going to be juniors again.

06:38.857 --> 06:42.277

I mean, Mom got to play.

Huh? The right way.

and showed them we can compete?

they've been training all winter.

- She can't, Dad.

- Because she's terrified of you!

we have a chance to win.
