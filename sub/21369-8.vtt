♪♪

00:05.830 --> 00:06.830
Raven:
Raven's Home was filmed

00:06.830 --> 00:08.290
in front
of a live studio audience.

00:09.500 --> 00:12.580
(women chattering)

00:12.580 --> 00:15.080
Good morning, Mother,
Auntie Rae.

00:15.080 --> 00:17.330
Oh, hello, Levi,
Steve Harvey.

00:19.290 --> 00:21.170
Why are you two
so dressed up?

00:21.170 --> 00:23.170
We'd like to take a moment
of your time to discuss

00:23.170 --> 00:25.380
the greatest
educational opportunity

00:25.380 --> 00:28.290
of this or any generation.

00:29.290 --> 00:32.540
Virtual reality goggles.
The future is now.

00:34.420 --> 00:37.000
This amazing technology
will allow us to travel

00:37.000 --> 00:40.040
to bold new worlds
and have awesome adventures.

00:40.040 --> 00:42.330
All without triggering
my hay fever.

00:44.210 --> 00:46.290
And for just $600.

00:46.290 --> 00:49.210
Wow!
They're just $600.

00:49.210 --> 00:52.250
I think "just"
stops at 19.99.

00:54.210 --> 00:58.170
But what if we paid for them
ourselves with the money you owe us?

00:58.170 --> 00:59.380
Owe you for what?

00:59.380 --> 01:02.120
I'm glad you asked.

01:02.120 --> 01:06.880
We figured if you pay us for all
the stuff we do around the house,

01:06.880 --> 01:10.750
we'd have more than enough
money to buy the goggles.

01:10.750 --> 01:14.420
-(both laugh) -Wow!
That's-- That's amazing!

01:14.420 --> 01:17.710
Chels, get this.
We owe them!

01:17.710 --> 01:21.120
-(Chelsea laughing) -I mean,
we carried those two around

01:21.120 --> 01:23.330
for nine months,
and what did we charge?

01:23.330 --> 01:25.790
Oh, for womb rental? Nada!

01:26.880 --> 01:29.080
We fed and clothed them
their entire lives?

01:29.080 --> 01:30.120
What did we get
for that, Rae?

01:30.120 --> 01:31.580
I'm still waitin'
on my check.

01:33.170 --> 01:37.790
We keep a roof over their head. Now,
how often do we do this, Chels?

01:37.790 --> 01:39.290
Er'y day, er'y day.

01:40.580 --> 01:43.000
So come to think about it,
you owe us.

01:43.000 --> 01:45.080
Now, do you still
wanna have this conversation?

01:45.080 --> 01:46.210
Both:
We're good.

02:42.500 --> 02:44.000
I still can't believe
you wouldn't get us

02:44.000 --> 02:46.330
virtual reality goggles, Mom.

02:46.330 --> 02:48.040
(scoffs) Really? I can.

02:48.040 --> 02:49.670
One time I asked her
for regular goggles,

02:49.670 --> 02:51.460
and she told me, "Swim
with your eyes closed."

02:53.330 --> 02:55.210
That was great advice.
You're welcome.

02:55.210 --> 02:56.790
And it saved me
about $25.

02:58.460 --> 02:59.460
If my dad were here,

02:59.460 --> 03:01.460
he would totally buy us
those goggles.

03:01.460 --> 03:03.830
He used to buy me stuff
all the time.

03:03.830 --> 03:05.460
He's an amazing businessman.

03:05.460 --> 03:07.120
He sure is, honey.

03:07.120 --> 03:08.580
He's the best.

03:08.580 --> 03:10.880
Uh, Chels, can I talk to you
for a second? Come here.

03:10.880 --> 03:12.170
Are we talkin' about, uh,

03:12.170 --> 03:13.330
your thievin' ex-husband,

03:13.330 --> 03:15.380
or does Levi have another dad
I don't know about?

03:15.380 --> 03:18.290
Oh, Rae! You're crazy!

03:18.290 --> 03:20.710
Okay, kids. It's time
to get ready.

03:20.710 --> 03:23.460
Tess' dad's about to pick
you up in his 18-wheeler.

03:23.460 --> 03:26.210
Yes! His rig's
got a toilet in it!

03:26.210 --> 03:27.670
I was gonna pee here,

03:27.670 --> 03:29.960
but I'm gonna hold it
for the truck.

03:31.620 --> 03:32.880
All right, be safe.

03:32.880 --> 03:34.330
-Have a good day. Bye-bye.
-Nia: Bye, Mom.

03:34.330 --> 03:35.580
(mutters)

03:36.670 --> 03:38.710
Uh, Chels? (clears throat)

03:38.710 --> 03:40.290
Why are you saying
nice things about Garret?

03:40.290 --> 03:44.460
Oh, I just really wanna remind Levi that's
his dad's still a good guy, you know?

03:44.460 --> 03:46.380
But he's-- he's not a good guy.

03:46.380 --> 03:48.210
Oh, sure he made
some poor choices--

03:48.210 --> 03:49.710
No-- No, Chels.
Cutting your bangs

03:49.710 --> 03:52.500
without a mirror, that's-- you
know, that's a poor choice.

03:52.500 --> 03:55.830
Um, Garret
is a criminal.

03:55.830 --> 03:57.790
What do you tell people
when they ask where he is?

03:57.790 --> 03:59.960
Oh, I-- I say
he's outta state.

03:59.960 --> 04:01.290
He's in prison.

04:01.290 --> 04:03.080
Yeah! Outta state.

04:04.920 --> 04:09.120
Chels! You had an invention
that made you rich!

04:09.120 --> 04:11.750
-You had infomercials, girl!
-Mm-hm.

04:11.750 --> 04:13.250
And then Garret
took it all away.

04:13.250 --> 04:15.580
Why do you keep sugarcoating
everything he does?

04:15.580 --> 04:18.620
I don't know, Rae. I guess it's 'cause
I like to see the glass half full.

04:18.620 --> 04:22.210
You don't have a glass to see half full!
He stole it!

04:23.290 --> 04:25.080
Seriously, this is not
good for you.

04:25.080 --> 04:27.920
You cannot keep bottling up
your emotions like this.

04:27.920 --> 04:29.880
It is not good for you
or Levi.

04:29.880 --> 04:35.830
Raven Lydia Baxter, I am not
holding in any anger, okay?

04:35.830 --> 04:38.290
Wow, now I know you're mad, 'cause
you're usin' my government name.

04:38.290 --> 04:39.380
I don't like it.

04:43.960 --> 04:47.710
Man, by the time we save up enough
to buy virtual reality goggles,

04:47.710 --> 04:50.250
everyone will be living
in virtual reality...

04:50.250 --> 04:52.620
except us, 'cause we
won't have the goggles!

04:53.880 --> 04:56.960
I can't believe the new vending
machine's already broken.

04:56.960 --> 04:59.750
How am I supposed to get
through Math without a snack?

04:59.750 --> 05:01.210
But you always
sleep through Math.

05:01.210 --> 05:04.170
I can't do it
on an empty stomach.

05:04.170 --> 05:06.080
I think I have
an extra granola bar.

05:07.330 --> 05:10.380
Sorry, Tess.
This granola bar is $3.

05:10.380 --> 05:12.620
But they only cost
a dollar at the store.

05:12.620 --> 05:15.710
Unfortunately for you,
we're not at the store.

05:17.540 --> 05:19.290
Levi, what are you doing?

05:19.290 --> 05:22.620
We need money for VR goggles, and
the vending machine is broken.

05:22.620 --> 05:26.460
It's classic supply and demand.
My dad taught me all about it.

05:26.460 --> 05:28.830
But I don't have $3.

05:28.830 --> 05:32.580
-Let's just say you owe me one.
-I'm not saying that.

05:32.580 --> 05:34.710
Sweet.
We just made two bucks.

05:34.710 --> 05:38.040
Exactly. And if we bring more
snacks from home and sell them,

05:38.040 --> 05:40.080
we can make the money
in no time.

05:40.080 --> 05:43.790
Guys, selling stuff at school
for profit is against the rules.

05:43.790 --> 05:47.920
So keep your voices down, we don't
want anybody to know what we're doing.

05:47.920 --> 05:49.210
What do you mean "we"?

05:49.210 --> 05:50.790
Oh, we're getting in
on this.

05:50.790 --> 05:54.080
Nia and I have been eyeing some
limited edition best friend sneakers.

05:54.080 --> 05:55.580
They glow when they're
next to each other.

05:57.710 --> 05:59.380
All right, you're in.

05:59.380 --> 06:01.210
But I'm in charge.

06:01.210 --> 06:03.120
You know the one in charge takes all
the blame if we get in trouble.

06:03.120 --> 06:04.710
Levi's in charge.

06:11.880 --> 06:13.330
I still don't understand

06:13.330 --> 06:15.250
why we had to get our camping
backpacks out of storage.

06:15.250 --> 06:18.710
'Cause they match. My dad says it
doesn't matter what you're selling

06:18.710 --> 06:20.880
if people don't know
where to buy it.

06:20.880 --> 06:24.040
Oh, no!
The vending machine's working!

06:24.040 --> 06:27.380
Look at those fools over there
buying all those overpriced snacks.

06:27.380 --> 06:29.790
They should be here
buying our overpriced snacks!

06:31.750 --> 06:33.120
Machine won't take my bill.

06:33.120 --> 06:35.750
This is some nonsense
right here.

06:35.750 --> 06:39.000
I'm goin' to my car to get some change...
nobody touch my Honey Yums.

06:44.170 --> 06:46.000
Great!
What do we do now?

06:46.000 --> 06:48.790
My dad says you have
to crush the competition.

06:48.790 --> 06:51.210
Well, our competition's
that vending machine.

06:51.210 --> 06:52.830
You want me
to throw a rock through it?

06:52.830 --> 06:53.880
Where'd you get a rock?

06:53.880 --> 06:55.540
I carry it with me.

06:55.540 --> 06:59.540
You think I'm gonna be the girl
who shows up without a rock?

06:59.540 --> 07:01.250
(school bell rings)

07:01.250 --> 07:03.960
Well, looks like we're not
gonna get those sneakers.

07:03.960 --> 07:05.790
Both: I guess we'll have
to think of another way

07:05.790 --> 07:07.620
to show people
we're best friends.

07:10.420 --> 07:13.710
We need
to shut this machine down.

07:13.710 --> 07:17.210
I know! I'll unplug it and put the
"out of order" sign back on it.

07:17.210 --> 07:19.040
Nobody will fall for that.

07:28.330 --> 07:30.960
They fall for it!
Do it, Levi!

07:30.960 --> 07:32.330
Unplug our competi--

07:33.580 --> 07:36.000
Oh. You already did it!
(laughs)

07:36.000 --> 07:37.580
Good for you!

07:38.750 --> 07:41.500
Book, get ready to be rich.

07:41.500 --> 07:42.920
Where'd you get
those sunglasses?

07:42.920 --> 07:47.210
The vending machine. You want me to
plug it back in, I can get you some.

07:50.750 --> 07:53.960
(jazz music plays)

08:27.380 --> 08:29.250
We totally sold out of snacks.

08:29.250 --> 08:32.080
Almost. Levi still has
one granola bar left.

08:32.080 --> 08:36.000
I don't care if it's 75 cents
in the machine.

08:36.000 --> 08:38.460
In these halls,
it's three bucks.

08:41.080 --> 08:43.000
I've gotta give it to you, Levi.

08:43.000 --> 08:44.920
Selling healthy snacks
at a moderate markup

08:44.920 --> 08:46.880
is straight baller, yo.

08:46.880 --> 08:50.120
I'm all about that snack life.

08:50.120 --> 08:52.710
Should we tell them how
ridiculous they sound?

08:52.710 --> 08:54.250
Nah, it's cute.

08:56.920 --> 08:59.580
I know you didn't get this
from the vending machine.

08:59.580 --> 09:00.920
Did somebody sell it to you?

09:02.500 --> 09:04.170
Mm-hm.

09:04.170 --> 09:05.920
An illegal snack ring, huh?

09:05.920 --> 09:09.380
If I bust this, they might
make me a full-time teacher.

09:09.380 --> 09:11.210
I can stop cuttin' hair
on the weekends.

09:12.880 --> 09:14.170
Come on.

09:20.120 --> 09:22.210
Hey, Rae, whatcha doin'?

09:22.210 --> 09:24.540
Chels... (clears throat)

09:24.540 --> 09:27.500
You can't keep ignoring your
feelings about Garret, all right?

09:27.500 --> 09:29.620
So today, I'm gonna
help you let 'em out.

09:29.620 --> 09:33.380
This is the prison
visitation window.

09:33.380 --> 09:36.920
You're gonna play you, and I'm gonna
play your no-good ex-husband.

09:36.920 --> 09:40.460
Oh! Ooh, you know
I love a good role play.

09:40.460 --> 09:44.960
You know, I was a "thea-tah"
minor in college.

09:44.960 --> 09:46.920
Let me just do a little vocal warm-up.
(clear throat)

09:46.920 --> 09:50.880
-Unique New York, Unique...
-Chelsea?

09:50.880 --> 09:52.040
Sit down.

09:53.790 --> 09:55.080
...New York.
Okay, got it.

09:56.960 --> 09:59.000
So, what's first?

10:03.210 --> 10:04.830
Wow.

10:04.830 --> 10:07.080
(imitating Garret) Chelsea,
darling, you look stupendous.

10:08.330 --> 10:11.790
It's incredible,
you sound just like him!

10:11.790 --> 10:16.000
Um, thank you, Garret. I'm very well,
you know I'm living with Raven now.

10:16.000 --> 10:19.250
(imitating Garret)
Ughh...

10:19.250 --> 10:23.460
I don't like that Raven friend
of yours, she talks too much.

10:23.460 --> 10:24.960
Yeah, I hear that.

10:24.960 --> 10:26.080
(mouths)

10:26.080 --> 10:28.460
I'm just kidding.

10:28.460 --> 10:29.920
So how are you?

10:29.920 --> 10:31.580
(imitating Garret) Well,
sweetheart, I'm in prison,

10:31.580 --> 10:34.880
so it's abysmal.
(chuckling)

10:34.880 --> 10:37.290
I shouldn't be here
in the first place.

10:37.290 --> 10:39.420
Well, Garret, you did
break the law.

10:39.420 --> 10:41.710
(as herself) Good job, Chels.
Good job.

10:41.710 --> 10:44.670
(clearing throat, imitating
Garret) Sweetie, they say

10:44.670 --> 10:47.170
that since I had a quarter
of a million dollars

10:47.170 --> 10:49.920
and a ticket to the Cayman
Islands, I was running away.

10:49.920 --> 10:53.460
I wasn't running away!
No! I was building

10:53.460 --> 10:56.830
a school
for the children!

10:56.830 --> 11:00.960
What? Is that what you were doing?
Rae, is that true?

11:00.960 --> 11:04.170
(high-pitched) No!

11:04.170 --> 11:07.040
Okay. Garret, no,
I know that's not true,

11:07.040 --> 11:09.380
you were going to meet the woman
you were gonna run away with.

11:09.380 --> 11:12.000
Good job, Chels.
Get him! Get him!

11:13.710 --> 11:17.120
-Unless she was gonna be a teacher
at the school...? -Oh, Chels!

11:17.120 --> 11:18.880
Chels, you had him!
You had him!

11:18.880 --> 11:22.250
I'm sorry, Rae, I don't know,
I-- I've been making excuses

11:22.250 --> 11:25.210
for Garret for so long,
I forgot how to get mad at him!

11:25.210 --> 11:27.000
It's okay, we'll find
something else.

11:27.000 --> 11:29.920
Okay.
What about interpretive dance?

11:29.920 --> 11:32.120
You know, that was my major.

11:37.500 --> 11:40.750
Guys, Spitz is onto us!
He knows about the snacks!

11:40.750 --> 11:42.790
If Mom finds out about this,
we're dead.

11:42.790 --> 11:45.420
Relax!
As long as he doesn't find us

11:45.420 --> 11:47.420
with this backpack full of cash,

11:47.420 --> 11:49.040
we'll be fine.

11:49.040 --> 11:50.210
Booker:
There's Spitz!

11:50.210 --> 11:51.710
Here Tess, you take it!

11:51.710 --> 11:53.750
I don't want it!
Booker, you take it!

11:53.750 --> 11:57.040
Not me. I'm too
pretty for detention.

11:57.040 --> 11:58.120
Don't give it to me!

11:58.120 --> 11:59.670
Hey!

11:59.670 --> 12:01.080
I wanna talk to you kids!

12:01.080 --> 12:02.040
Run!

12:04.120 --> 12:06.580
(yelps, grunting)

12:09.210 --> 12:10.620
(panting)

12:10.620 --> 12:12.120
I need to check your backpack.

12:14.210 --> 12:16.170
No... y-- you don't wanna
look in there.

12:16.170 --> 12:17.330
Why not?

12:17.330 --> 12:19.880
'Cause my mom packs me
a banana every day.

12:19.880 --> 12:21.670
I don't eat
a banana every day.

12:24.880 --> 12:26.040
So this is yours?

12:26.040 --> 12:31.880
Yes. Yes, this is my most
favorite flowery head thingy.

12:31.880 --> 12:33.330
Good day to you.

12:35.330 --> 12:37.120
Hey, you!
Red backpack!

12:42.920 --> 12:45.750
It's a rock.
I don't know why.

12:47.380 --> 12:50.120
-Whoa!
-Tess, get back here!

12:52.790 --> 12:54.080
Give me that!

13:00.380 --> 13:02.290
I suppose there's
a good explanation for this?

13:02.290 --> 13:04.210
Go ahead.
I'm listening.

13:05.290 --> 13:09.170
Hey!
Where's your backpack?

13:09.170 --> 13:11.330
I seem to have
misplaced it, sir.

13:20.000 --> 13:21.790
Ha!
The garbage can!

13:21.790 --> 13:24.080
I got you! You thought
you could outsmart me!

13:24.080 --> 13:26.790
But you can't. 'Cause my
brain's my biggest muscle.

13:30.250 --> 13:32.290
Coach Spitz,
please don't open it.

13:38.120 --> 13:42.330
Probably should have told you
I had 540 super balls in there.

13:43.920 --> 13:45.960
I thought
there was money in here.

13:45.960 --> 13:47.710
Looks like I owe you
an apology.

13:51.250 --> 13:52.540
Where's my apology?

13:52.540 --> 13:54.420
I said I owe you.

13:58.250 --> 13:59.710
Whoa!

13:59.710 --> 14:01.250
That was way too close.

14:01.250 --> 14:02.540
Levi, where's the money?

14:02.540 --> 14:04.960
Let's just say
I got it on me.

14:07.750 --> 14:10.080
You glued the money
to your body?

14:10.080 --> 14:11.420
I didn't have a lot of time!

14:11.420 --> 14:14.210
All I had was a glue stick
or a stapler.

14:14.210 --> 14:15.290
Coward!

14:16.670 --> 14:18.210
Come on, let's get it off.

14:18.210 --> 14:21.080
It's like a band-aid. You
gotta take it off real slow.

14:22.960 --> 14:24.210
Ow!

14:25.170 --> 14:26.960
Or was it fast?
I can ne--

14:26.960 --> 14:29.750
No, no, no!
Cotton candy, that stings!

14:30.750 --> 14:34.000
-Hey, I wanna try!
-No! You'll enjoy it!

14:35.750 --> 14:38.620
Remember, buddy. You're
doin' it for the goggles.

14:38.620 --> 14:41.120
Right.
For the goggles.

14:43.170 --> 14:45.080
(screaming)
Hatchi-Matchi!

14:46.250 --> 14:49.380
Crab cake combo!

14:49.380 --> 14:53.460
Founding fathers,
that stings!

14:56.670 --> 14:59.420
Wait! But how is my wedding
china supposed to help me

14:59.420 --> 15:00.830
get in touch
with my anger?

15:00.830 --> 15:03.580
-You're gonna smash it.
-What? Why would I do that?

15:03.580 --> 15:06.142
Because, Chels, there's
only two things that

15:06.167 --> 15:08.420
survived your
relationship with Garret,

15:08.420 --> 15:11.670
Levi and these plates, and I'm
not gonna let you smash Levi...

15:11.670 --> 15:15.040
unless he uses
my good conditioner again.

15:15.040 --> 15:17.500
No, Rae, these plates
are beautiful.

15:17.500 --> 15:20.710
How am I supposed to get mad
at a modern chinoiserie

15:20.710 --> 15:22.960
with a French country flair?

15:24.080 --> 15:26.080
Maybe this'll help.

15:26.080 --> 15:29.420
Oh, no.
Not the Schmop.

15:29.420 --> 15:31.790
Oh yes, Chels,
the Schmop.

15:31.790 --> 15:34.250
Your invention.
The thing that made you rich

15:34.250 --> 15:36.290
until Garret stole
all your money!

15:36.290 --> 15:37.250
-Put it away!
-No!

15:37.250 --> 15:39.670
-Raven!
-Chelsea!

15:39.670 --> 15:44.500
You worked so hard
for so long.

15:46.250 --> 15:51.750
And then Garret came in
and took your money.

15:51.750 --> 15:53.290
Now look at it, Chelsea.

15:54.540 --> 15:56.330
Does it make you mad?

15:56.330 --> 15:59.330
-Yeah. -Yeah, it does, show me
how mad it makes you, girl.

15:59.330 --> 16:02.210
-(screams)
-There you go!

16:02.210 --> 16:05.710
-(laughs) How do you feel? -I feel
good, Rae, I feel really good.

16:05.710 --> 16:08.540
-You ready? You ready?
-Yeah! Woo!

16:08.540 --> 16:11.380
Oh my god, I can't even
believe this!

16:11.380 --> 16:14.710
I'm not even mad that these
plates are like $300 each!

16:14.710 --> 16:17.380
Whoa!

16:17.380 --> 16:21.380
Excuse me, did you just say I could resell
these plates for about $300 apiece?

16:21.380 --> 16:23.750
Well, probably more, they
discontinued this pattern.

16:23.750 --> 16:25.170
Wh-- Noooo!

16:25.170 --> 16:26.460
No, no, Chelsea, stop!

16:26.460 --> 16:30.330
-Stop it! Stop it! -Rae, come on!
I'm finally feeling my anger!

16:30.330 --> 16:34.830
Well, girl, I'm feelin' about $3,000 worth
of plates underneath this arm right now.

16:34.830 --> 16:36.460
Well, this was your idea.

16:36.460 --> 16:39.170
And it was a bad idea.

16:39.170 --> 16:41.250
Rae, just give me
the plates, huh?

16:41.250 --> 16:43.380
-No! No! -Raven! What?
Give me the plates!

16:43.380 --> 16:44.580
No, Chelsea, no!

16:44.580 --> 16:45.880
Aaah!

16:45.880 --> 16:47.420
Listen here, we're gonna
walk down these stairs,

16:47.420 --> 16:49.620
and you're gonna break
my plates, why?

16:49.620 --> 16:51.960
'Cause they're worth nothing.

16:53.000 --> 16:55.380
-We'll break those plates, too!
-No! No!

16:57.710 --> 17:00.040
Rae? Come on!

17:00.040 --> 17:01.750
I need to break those dishes.

17:01.750 --> 17:04.500
Okay, all right-- Oh-- Here,
look, break this tacky vase.

17:04.500 --> 17:06.170
But I gave you that vase.

17:06.170 --> 17:08.710
You did!
And I am willing

17:08.710 --> 17:11.120
to sacrifice it
for our friendship.

17:12.420 --> 17:15.120
Levi: Whoopi Goldberg,
that stings!

17:15.120 --> 17:17.120
-What are they doing?
-I don't know.

17:18.500 --> 17:21.080
Almost done. Let me
know when you're ready.

17:21.080 --> 17:25.040
I think I just need a minute
or two-- French bread pizza!

17:26.460 --> 17:29.880
I keep thinkin' it'll stop
bein' funny, but it doesn't!

17:31.330 --> 17:34.960
It's making me uncomfortable. He looks
like a baby owl with no feathers.

17:36.120 --> 17:38.380
Last one.
Hold still, Levi.

17:38.380 --> 17:42.460
Technically, it's not the last one, but
I prefer to remove the rest in private.

17:45.120 --> 17:47.540
One... two...

17:47.540 --> 17:49.500
(screams)

17:52.170 --> 17:54.290
Who is makin' it rain in here?

17:55.920 --> 17:57.880
Where did all this money
come from?

17:57.880 --> 18:00.380
My torso mostly.

18:00.380 --> 18:03.540
Okay, I want everyone in
the living room right now!

18:03.540 --> 18:05.290
-Come on.
-Right now!

18:05.290 --> 18:06.750
Come on, come on, come
on, come on, come on!

18:06.750 --> 18:08.420
No-no-no-no-no, no-no.
You stay.

18:08.420 --> 18:11.290
Put some clothes on. You look
like one of them hairless cats.

18:16.210 --> 18:18.620
So you're really not gonna tell
us where the money came from?

18:18.620 --> 18:22.580
We believe it's in our best
interest to keep quiet.

18:22.580 --> 18:25.170
I'm sorry, do you think
that you're in a police station?

18:25.170 --> 18:28.500
You don't have any rights. This
is the United States of Raven!

18:30.330 --> 18:32.170
Where'd you get the money,
you little punks, huh?

18:32.170 --> 18:35.540
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa, Chelsea!
Chelsea, come on now,

18:35.540 --> 18:36.790
I'm the bad cop,
you're the good cop.

18:36.790 --> 18:40.830
You're supposed to offer them, like,
a cold beverage and a way out.

18:40.830 --> 18:44.000
Sorry, I guess getting in touch with
my anger's opened up the floodgates.

18:44.000 --> 18:46.750
Yeah. Close them floodgates,
you're scarin' me.

18:46.750 --> 18:48.750
Okay, you guys are not
gonna get away with this.

18:48.750 --> 18:51.500
You better start talkin, huh, or
I'm gonna get those hair clippers,

18:51.500 --> 18:52.420
and I'm not gonna
stop shaving

18:52.420 --> 18:55.040
until every single one
of you is bald.

18:55.040 --> 18:57.540
No. No-no-no, not my hair.

18:57.540 --> 19:01.540
That's how people tell the
difference between me and Booker.

19:01.540 --> 19:03.420
Mom... I'm scared.

19:04.880 --> 19:06.750
Yeah, I don't live here.
I'm gone.

19:06.750 --> 19:08.580
Wait, no. Wait, please
don't tell your mama.

19:08.580 --> 19:10.210
Please don't tell her.

19:10.210 --> 19:12.170
Chels, you gotta calm down.

19:12.170 --> 19:14.120
Come on, Rae,
they're about to break.

19:14.120 --> 19:15.880
I can see it
in their beady little eyes.

19:15.880 --> 19:17.500
(shouting)
Where'd you get the money, huh?

19:17.500 --> 19:19.000
I will go out, and I will
get that pool noodle.

19:19.000 --> 19:21.250
(shouting) I will whack a
kid with a pool noodle!

19:21.250 --> 19:22.460
Chelsea!

19:23.880 --> 19:25.540
Mom!
What's the big deal?

19:25.540 --> 19:27.500
All we did was shut down
the vending machine,

19:27.500 --> 19:29.830
so we could sell snacks
at school.

19:29.830 --> 19:31.040
You did what?

19:31.040 --> 19:33.040
We bent the rules
to get ahead.

19:33.040 --> 19:35.210
Dad did stuff like that
all the time.

19:37.460 --> 19:41.170
You're right! Your father did do
stuff like that all the time, Levi,

19:41.170 --> 19:42.420
that's why he's in jail.

19:42.420 --> 19:44.000
And now you're acting
just like him.

19:44.000 --> 19:45.710
You don't know
what you're talking about!

19:45.710 --> 19:49.170
-Levi. Levi! -Chels, Chels!
Give him a minute.

19:49.170 --> 19:51.920
-(door slams)
-No, Rae, you were right.

19:51.920 --> 19:54.210
I wasn't honest
about Garret and...

19:54.210 --> 19:56.460
now Levi thinks
what he did was okay.

20:00.290 --> 20:01.460
Woo.
(sighs)

20:03.670 --> 20:04.580
Wow.

20:05.670 --> 20:07.750
So it was Levi all along?

20:09.790 --> 20:11.960
You think you know a guy.

20:13.540 --> 20:15.460
-Go to your room.
-For how long?

20:15.460 --> 20:16.670
Until your kids let you out.

20:22.880 --> 20:25.500
Hey.
Can I come in?

20:29.920 --> 20:32.750
You know I-- I didn't mean
to yell at you out there, honey,

20:32.750 --> 20:37.000
I-- I got really scared when I
saw you actin' like your father.

20:37.000 --> 20:39.670
Why?
I don't get it.

20:39.670 --> 20:42.620
You always say
Dad's a good guy.

20:42.620 --> 20:45.080
Yeah, well, it's complicated.

20:45.080 --> 20:49.670
Your father isn't a bad guy, but
he did do some very bad things.

20:49.670 --> 20:51.250
And I should've
talked to you about it.

20:51.250 --> 20:53.790
-Hmm?
-Why didn't you?

20:53.790 --> 20:56.040
I was tryin'
to protect you,

20:56.040 --> 20:59.420
but I think in the end
I just confused you.

20:59.420 --> 21:03.880
The truth is...
your father broke the law,

21:03.880 --> 21:06.420
and he hurt our family, honey.

21:06.420 --> 21:09.080
He's in prison
because he deserves to be.

21:09.080 --> 21:11.040
So do you hate him?

21:11.040 --> 21:14.210
No.
No, I couldn't hate him.

21:14.210 --> 21:16.880
If it weren't for him,
I wouldn't have you.

21:20.790 --> 21:22.620
I'm mad at him.

21:22.620 --> 21:24.670
And you have
every right to be.

21:26.120 --> 21:28.670
But, we're gonna
figure this out together.

21:28.670 --> 21:29.710
You know?
Just you and me,

21:29.710 --> 21:31.250
and if you ever
wanna talk about it,

21:31.250 --> 21:32.790
I'm here.

21:32.790 --> 21:34.540
I love you.

21:34.540 --> 21:35.960
I love you, too.

21:38.040 --> 21:40.290
-(groans) Mom, not so tight.
-(gasps)

21:40.290 --> 21:41.920
Still got a bad case
of money burn.

21:41.920 --> 21:43.000
Oh!

21:45.000 --> 21:47.670
You know, what you did
at school was very bad.

21:47.670 --> 21:49.670
I'm gonna have to ground you
for two weeks.

21:49.670 --> 21:52.120
Any chance of time off
for good behavior?

21:52.120 --> 21:55.250
Well, I'll put in a good word
with the judge.

21:55.250 --> 21:59.380
Oh. No, wait,
I am the judge, so, um, no.

22:03.620 --> 22:08.960
Hi, I'm Chelsea Grayson, inventor of
the revolutionary new cleaning tool,

22:08.960 --> 22:12.620
the Schmop. It makes housework...
shmousework.

22:12.620 --> 22:15.000
(laughs)

22:17.500 --> 22:20.960
I didn't know they had mops
in the olden days.

22:20.960 --> 22:25.750
The olden days? Boy, that
was like seven years ago.

22:25.750 --> 22:27.500
How have we not seen this?

22:27.500 --> 22:29.750
Well, Nia, for a while there,
I just wanted to forget

22:29.750 --> 22:31.620
about that part of my life.

22:31.620 --> 22:34.790
I'd wanna forget
that hairstyle.

22:34.790 --> 22:36.670
All right, all right now.

22:36.670 --> 22:40.830
Even though her hair is awful, you
don't say it to her face. It's rude.

22:40.830 --> 22:43.040
I can say it, though,
'cause I'm your bestie.

22:44.080 --> 22:45.170
I'd be careful what you say

22:45.170 --> 22:46.210
about my hair, Rae,

22:46.210 --> 22:47.330
I think you're in this, too.

22:47.330 --> 22:49.120
(gasps) Turn it off!
Turn it off!

22:49.120 --> 22:51.250
No! No! No! No! No!

22:51.250 --> 22:54.500
-We gotta see this.
-(Chelsea laughing)

22:54.500 --> 22:55.710
Now listen up, guys.

22:55.710 --> 22:58.170
If you order now, we'll send you
a second Schmop

22:58.170 --> 23:00.420
for no extra charge, right?

23:00.420 --> 23:01.580
That's a Schmop
for you,

23:01.580 --> 23:04.540
and a Schmop
for your best friend. (laughs)

23:04.540 --> 23:06.380
Yep! That's me!

23:06.380 --> 23:08.380
(both laughing)

23:10.290 --> 23:12.380
(laughter continues
on computer)

23:14.580 --> 23:15.880
Okay, okay,
okay, first one

23:15.880 --> 23:17.830
of you to laugh
is grounded.

23:18.920 --> 23:20.250
We're already grounded!

23:20.250 --> 23:25.960
(laughter)
