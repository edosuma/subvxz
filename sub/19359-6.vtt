WEBVTT

00:18.250 --> 00:19.250
HANNAH: I've been
thinking so much,

00:19.750 --> 00:21.250
and any way that
I think about it

00:21.250 --> 00:22.458
I just get this feeling...

00:22.458 --> 00:23.875
That this is your baby.

00:23.875 --> 00:24.917
This is my baby.

00:25.750 --> 00:27.250
I think we should
break up, Marn.

00:27.250 --> 00:29.417
Ray, I think this might
be the grief talking.

00:29.417 --> 00:31.542
I want more. You know,
I need more.

00:31.750 --> 00:32.917
ACTRESS: I'm gonna ruin
your life.

00:33.125 --> 00:34.917
I don't understand
the point of this scene.

00:34.917 --> 00:37.083
It's about the tragedy
of realizing the relationship

00:37.083 --> 00:38.583
is too intense to survive.

00:38.583 --> 00:41.125
A toast to Hannah's baby.

00:41.125 --> 00:44.542
We had a really special,
specific thing going on,

00:44.542 --> 00:47.500
you and me. You're gonna be
a terrible mother.

00:48.375 --> 00:51.834
Jesus, don't worry about it.
Kids are super easy.

00:53.125 --> 00:54.667
It's being an adult that's hard.

01:03.417 --> 01:05.667
How do you feel about me
dressing the salad?

01:05.667 --> 01:08.708
I feel good
if you think you can do it
without overdressing it.

01:08.708 --> 01:11.250
I'll probably just,
you know, stick with this.

01:11.250 --> 01:13.250
Perfect.

01:13.250 --> 01:17.000
Um, so I know that this dinner
is because you have some
big news to tell me,

01:17.000 --> 01:19.583
and I don't wanna
top your news,

01:19.583 --> 01:22.834
but Ray broke up with me.
( sighs )

01:22.834 --> 01:24.750
- Can you believe that?
- Kind of, yeah.

01:24.750 --> 01:26.917
I mean, you're, like,
a horrible cunt to him, so.

01:26.917 --> 01:30.250
I'm sorry, Marnie.
It's just this man drama
cycle is so endless.

01:30.250 --> 01:31.500
I can't keep up
anymore.

01:31.500 --> 01:33.792
Ray was supposed
to break the cycle.

01:33.792 --> 01:36.542
And besides, he was just
supposed to be grateful that
I even wanted to talk to him.

01:36.542 --> 01:39.500
Anyway, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to
top your news.

01:39.500 --> 01:41.291
So, what do you got?

01:41.291 --> 01:42.333
Well, um...

01:43.834 --> 01:46.208
- I'm pregnant.
- That's very funny.

01:46.208 --> 01:49.125
Not a joke,
just what's going on
in my uterus.

01:51.583 --> 01:54.125
Holy fucking shit.

01:54.125 --> 01:56.250
Hannah,
how did this happen?

01:56.250 --> 01:58.166
How does anything happen?
I went to the Hamptons.

01:58.166 --> 02:01.750
Yeah, and you decided just
to not use any birth control
whatsoever?

02:01.750 --> 02:04.333
I told him to pull out,
but you know I tend
to swallow my Ps,

02:04.333 --> 02:07.083
so maybe he thought I said,
"All out." I don't know.

02:07.083 --> 02:08.542
Are you fucking
kidding me?

02:08.542 --> 02:10.708
Hannah, the pull-out method
does not work.

02:10.708 --> 02:13.458
I literally know
hundreds of pull-out babies.

02:13.458 --> 02:15.208
You do not know
a hundred babies.

02:15.208 --> 02:16.750
Hannah, what are you
going to do?

02:16.750 --> 02:19.000
Well,
that's the news.

02:19.000 --> 02:20.500
I'm gonna keep it.

02:20.500 --> 02:22.250
- No, you're not.
- Yes, I am.

02:22.250 --> 02:25.208
Stop fucking with me.
You're not gonna
have a baby.

02:25.208 --> 02:27.375
I'm gonna have a baby.

02:34.375 --> 02:35.875
I'm into it.

02:35.875 --> 02:37.333
- Really?
- Yeah.

02:37.333 --> 02:38.959
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

02:38.959 --> 02:41.333
You're old enough,
so, yeah.

02:41.333 --> 02:44.291
And, you know,
on the spectrum
of human beings,

02:44.291 --> 02:45.708
you basically have
your shit together.

02:45.708 --> 02:47.166
Plus, wouldn't it be
kind of great

02:47.166 --> 02:49.000
just to have
somebody else
to consider?

02:49.000 --> 02:52.208
I can't believe how
supportive you're being.
This is a shock.

02:52.208 --> 02:54.417
It kind of makes me
want to do it less.

02:54.417 --> 02:57.208
Oh, my God!
This is wild.

02:57.208 --> 02:59.125
Okay,
I have a million
questions.

02:59.125 --> 03:00.750
Do you know
if it's a boy or a girl?

03:00.750 --> 03:02.625
No, it's, like,
way too early for that,

03:02.625 --> 03:05.542
but if it's not a girl,
or like, the gayest boy
in the entire world,

03:05.542 --> 03:07.250
obviously I'm gonna
flip the fuck out.

03:07.250 --> 03:08.959
Oh, the father.

03:08.959 --> 03:11.250
Like,
is he gonna be involved?
Is he gonna help?

03:11.250 --> 03:13.917
- I'm not telling him.
- He doesn't know?

03:13.917 --> 03:16.792
No, I don't want him to be
a part of the kid's life,
so why would I tell him?

03:16.792 --> 03:19.417
Because he's the father
and he deserves to know.

03:19.417 --> 03:22.125
That's a pretty patriarchal,
old-fashioned attitude to have.

03:22.125 --> 03:25.041
You are obviously
going to tell him
eventually.

03:25.041 --> 03:27.625
But even if you weren't
planning on it,

03:27.625 --> 03:29.667
your baby is gonna
grow up to wonder,

03:29.667 --> 03:32.166
like, "Where is my father
and why did he leave us?"

03:32.166 --> 03:34.000
Yeah, and I can
worry about that
when she can talk,

03:34.000 --> 03:35.542
when she's, like, seven.

03:35.542 --> 03:37.291
And until then,
I don't want to have
to trouble him.

03:37.291 --> 03:39.125
He has enough stress
with, like, his, you know,

03:39.125 --> 03:41.125
water skiing issues
and his girlfriend.

03:41.125 --> 03:42.792
So, he's a water skier
with a girlfriend?

03:42.792 --> 03:45.125
It's my body, okay,
and it's my baby,

03:45.125 --> 03:47.959
and I have made the choice
that I am not going
to tell him.

03:47.959 --> 03:50.250
Okay, I take back
what I said about you
having your shit together

03:50.250 --> 03:52.000
because this
is fucking insane.

03:52.000 --> 03:53.792
I knew that
you were gonna try
to be controlling

03:53.792 --> 03:56.166
and control the entire way
that I brought my child
into this world.

03:56.166 --> 03:58.959
And I probably
shouldn't have even told you
until I was in labor.

04:02.458 --> 04:05.417
Marnie: Oh, my God,
this is first trimester
hormones, isn't it?

04:05.417 --> 04:07.000
No!

04:07.000 --> 04:08.834
( music playing )

04:13.875 --> 04:17.000
Okay, so, I thought
we would start with
"Whoa, Whoa, Wonderful."

04:17.000 --> 04:19.000
And then I think
it would be cool

04:19.000 --> 04:20.834
to go into
"Song for Marcus Garvey."

04:20.834 --> 04:23.208
Then I was thinking
we'd do "The Boys at Home."

04:23.208 --> 04:25.125
I ain't singing
no war stories tonight.
Uh-uh.

04:25.125 --> 04:26.750
Okay, what about
"Coco Kelly Shelly"?

04:26.750 --> 04:29.542
What the fuck
did you just do?
That's a rental!

04:29.542 --> 04:32.041
You know what?
( sucks teeth )

04:32.041 --> 04:33.792
I can't do this
right now.

04:33.792 --> 04:36.000
I'm feeling
really overworked.
Sorry.

04:36.000 --> 04:38.625
We haven't done a show
in two weeks and you don't
have any other job.

04:38.625 --> 04:40.542
- What are you working on?
- Yeah. You know what?

04:40.542 --> 04:42.291
I've been thinking about
this show for two weeks, okay?

04:42.291 --> 04:45.417
And it's left me
totally fucking drained.
I got nothing.

04:45.417 --> 04:47.500
Oh, Jesus Christ,
just get through tonight

04:47.500 --> 04:49.417
and tomorrow night
for Sharva's birthday,

04:49.417 --> 04:51.250
and then you can go
on a well-earned vacation.

04:51.250 --> 04:53.041
- Excuse me. Time out, Marnie.
- You can go on a fucking
cruise.

04:53.041 --> 04:55.041
Excuse me.
What's tomorrow?

04:55.041 --> 04:57.708
My mom's friend's
birthday in New Jersey.
We've gone over this.

04:57.708 --> 04:59.417
- Is that a joke?
- Nope.

04:59.417 --> 05:03.583
Fuck!
Marnie, I told you
no more bullshit gigs.

05:03.583 --> 05:06.041
- Oh, Jesus.
- No more bullshit gigs!

05:06.041 --> 05:08.500
I'm tired
of being exploited.

05:08.500 --> 05:09.917
Exploited?

05:09.917 --> 05:13.125
Rehab let me know
that you exploit me.

05:13.125 --> 05:14.333
No, no, no.
I see what you're doing.

05:14.333 --> 05:15.667
Do not change
the fucking subject.

05:15.667 --> 05:17.041
You're not getting
out of this.

05:17.041 --> 05:18.875
This show means
way too much to my mom.

05:18.875 --> 05:21.041
And her friendship
with Sharva is pretty much
all she's got left.

05:21.041 --> 05:23.166
And by the way,
not that you give a shit,

05:23.166 --> 05:26.542
but we are being
paid handsomely for this
and we need the money.

05:26.542 --> 05:28.667
Oh, money.
Money!

05:28.667 --> 05:30.708
Yes, the fucking money!

05:30.708 --> 05:32.000
Oh, the money!

05:32.000 --> 05:33.333
Oh!

05:33.333 --> 05:35.667
Fuck money!
( spits )

05:35.667 --> 05:38.083
Do you honestly think
that I'm, like, dying
to perform

05:38.083 --> 05:40.917
at some shitty club
in New Jersey

05:40.917 --> 05:42.250
called "La Vue"?

05:42.250 --> 05:43.500
I couldn't
possibly imagine

05:43.500 --> 05:44.875
what you do
or do not want to do.

05:44.875 --> 05:46.834
You used to be
a dream come true.

05:46.834 --> 05:48.583
This whole job used to be
a dream come true.

05:48.583 --> 05:50.917
Now it is a bad dream
come true.

05:50.917 --> 05:55.417
I cannot believe
that this is my
fucking life!

05:55.417 --> 05:56.917
Where the fuck
are you going?

05:56.917 --> 05:59.125
Taking five.

05:59.125 --> 06:01.250
Then I'm gonna maybe
kill myself or something.

06:01.250 --> 06:02.458
I'm not sure.

06:04.625 --> 06:05.542
( sighs )

06:06.750 --> 06:08.834
What are you
doing today?

06:08.834 --> 06:11.917
Oh, I'm just interviewing
this controversial app creator
for "Esquire,"

06:11.917 --> 06:14.041
and then I have dinner
with my dad and Keith.

06:14.041 --> 06:15.417
Oh.

06:15.417 --> 06:18.458
My friend Carlos is having
a hot dog taco party.

06:18.458 --> 06:20.250
It's not hot dogs
and tacos,

06:20.250 --> 06:23.208
rather, he makes the tacos
out of hot dogs.

06:23.208 --> 06:26.959
I thought I would go by
before my shift at Bendel's.
Do you want to come?

06:26.959 --> 06:29.000
I can't.
I'm on deadline
for this thing.

06:29.000 --> 06:32.041
Totally. Cool.
Um, I just thought
you would really

06:32.041 --> 06:34.208
like those taco dogs.

06:34.208 --> 06:36.250
( laughs )

06:36.250 --> 06:38.542
For the record,
I don't think

06:38.542 --> 06:40.458
you're going to be
a terrible mother.

06:40.458 --> 06:41.959
You're maybe
not gonna be the best,

06:41.959 --> 06:43.375
but you're certainly
not gonna be the worst.

06:43.375 --> 06:46.166
I mean, Candy Spelling
is still alive, so.

06:46.166 --> 06:48.458
I wasn't trying to say
that I was gonna, like,
win any prizes.

06:48.458 --> 06:50.125
I'm just not gonna,
like, call my kid fat

06:50.125 --> 06:52.333
or let a teacher
massage them or whatever.

06:52.333 --> 06:55.083
Yeah, better than either
of our parents did.

06:55.083 --> 06:57.917
Plus, everybody I know
with great parents
is boring as shit.

06:57.917 --> 06:59.333
You're right.

06:59.333 --> 07:01.500
Like,
remember that guy Steve
I dated freshman year?

07:01.500 --> 07:04.500
He loved his parents
so much, he couldn't even
get an erection.

07:04.500 --> 07:08.542
Yeah, see?
People with great parents
they name kid "Steve."

07:08.542 --> 07:11.083
Anyway, I just--

07:11.083 --> 07:12.750
I feel badly
for what I said.

07:12.750 --> 07:14.542
And I guess
if I'm being honest,

07:14.542 --> 07:16.375
I just--
I really liked it

07:16.375 --> 07:19.750
when we both didn't
have anything going on
in our lives.

07:19.750 --> 07:22.041
What you said
really scared me.

07:22.041 --> 07:24.708
You made me feel
like this baby was gonna
end our friendship.

07:24.708 --> 07:27.500
I don't want
our friendship to end.

07:27.500 --> 07:30.166
I need you in my life.
I need you in my child's life.

07:30.166 --> 07:32.583
I want to be
in your child's life.

07:32.583 --> 07:35.458
I just don't think I'm gonna
be a very good influence.

07:35.458 --> 07:38.375
Neither am I,
obviously.

07:38.375 --> 07:39.708
( laughs )

07:39.708 --> 07:41.208
But our kid's gonna
have great skin

07:41.208 --> 07:42.625
and be the right kind
of slutty.

07:42.625 --> 07:44.542
- "Our kid."
- Mm-hmm.

07:44.542 --> 07:46.375
- Love you.
- I love you.

07:46.375 --> 07:48.834
To be clear,
I'm not offering
to pay for anything.

07:48.834 --> 07:50.208
- Nothing?
- No.

07:50.208 --> 07:51.500
Mm.

07:52.792 --> 07:54.708
( phone chiming )

07:57.375 --> 07:58.834
Adam will not
stop calling me.

07:58.834 --> 08:00.708
- Gross.
- What do you want?

08:00.708 --> 08:03.208
- Did you watch it?
- No, dude, and I can't.

08:03.208 --> 08:05.041
I don't have time.
I'm late for work.

08:05.041 --> 08:07.583
( mouthing words )
I love you.

08:08.917 --> 08:10.792
Well, I think
you should watch it.

08:10.792 --> 08:14.208
Adam, I don't want
to watch it, okay?

08:15.458 --> 08:16.875
Great, you're
stalking me now?

08:16.875 --> 08:18.667
That's very three-years-ago.
I appreciate it.

08:18.667 --> 08:20.291
I need you to watch
the movie, Hannah.

08:20.291 --> 08:23.458
- Why?
- Because it's a movie
I made about us.

08:23.458 --> 08:25.667
For us.
And for the world.

08:25.667 --> 08:27.333
But mostly for us.

08:27.333 --> 08:29.291
Great, so you expect me
to believe you made
anything for me?

08:29.291 --> 08:31.917
- That is very rich.
- Why are you avoiding it
so hard?

08:31.917 --> 08:34.582
It's not a big commitment.
It's just under 47 minutes.

08:34.582 --> 08:37.291
I'm avoiding it
'cause I'd literally
rather do anything else.

08:37.291 --> 08:38.917
Like I would prefer
to eat my own arm.

08:38.917 --> 08:40.792
But maybe your resistance
is telling you

08:40.792 --> 08:42.582
that you actually
need to be watching it.

08:42.582 --> 08:44.250
It's really not.

08:44.250 --> 08:46.417
This is like when
everyone was telling me
I had to watch "The Wire."

08:46.417 --> 08:47.792
I didn't want
to watch "The Wire."

08:47.792 --> 08:49.458
I don't care
about that show.

08:49.458 --> 08:51.083
Why are you pushing me?

08:51.083 --> 08:53.208
Because I need
you-- okay.

08:53.208 --> 08:55.500
'Cause I need you
to tell me if it's real.

08:55.500 --> 08:58.583
I made a movie about
what we went through, okay?

08:58.583 --> 09:01.291
And I need you to tell me
if I got it right.

09:01.291 --> 09:03.083
That my memories
are your memories.

09:03.083 --> 09:05.667
You know, did I lie
about anything?

09:05.667 --> 09:07.500
I want to know
we felt the same things.

09:07.500 --> 09:09.625
I guarantee you
we did not.

09:09.625 --> 09:12.291
Please!
I need you to watch it
so I can move on

09:12.291 --> 09:14.458
and do my film festival
submissions.

09:14.458 --> 09:16.417
Submit!
Submit away, Adam.

09:16.417 --> 09:18.208
Go to Cannes,
I don't care.

09:18.208 --> 09:19.959
But I think
when you watch it,
you'll be liberated

09:19.959 --> 09:23.166
from what
I can say were, for me,
some very painful memories.

09:23.166 --> 09:26.333
Great, our relationship
amounted to very painful
memories for you.

09:26.333 --> 09:28.583
- Such soothing information.
- Not the relationship.

09:28.583 --> 09:30.542
The dissolution
of a relationship.

09:30.542 --> 09:32.083
Don't you want to stop
carrying around

09:32.083 --> 09:34.041
all the baggage
of our failures?

09:34.041 --> 09:36.583
I think my film
can grant you that.
I know it can.

09:36.583 --> 09:39.041
- It can help you move on.
- I have moved on.

09:39.041 --> 09:40.708
You know you haven't!

09:40.708 --> 09:42.583
Look at yourself!
Look how angry
you're getting.

09:42.583 --> 09:44.959
I'm not angry!
I have moved on.

09:44.959 --> 09:46.166
Well, I don't
believe you.

09:46.166 --> 09:47.708
Well, I'm pregnant.

09:49.208 --> 09:50.333
What?

09:50.333 --> 09:53.834
Yeah, Adam.
I'm two months pregnant.

09:53.834 --> 09:55.250
No, you're not.

09:55.250 --> 09:56.792
Yes, I am.

09:56.792 --> 09:58.708
Who's the--
who's the father?
Is it--

09:58.708 --> 10:00.750
Is it Jan's?

10:00.750 --> 10:02.000
No, it's not Fran's.

10:02.000 --> 10:03.750
Okay?
It's not important
who it is.

10:03.750 --> 10:05.291
I don't know
if I want him to be
part of the kid's life.

10:05.291 --> 10:06.583
I might not
even tell him.

10:06.583 --> 10:07.959
You can't do that.

10:07.959 --> 10:10.166
Well, I'm doing it.

10:10.166 --> 10:11.583
Wait, Hannah.

10:11.583 --> 10:13.333
Hannah, will you
talk to me, please?

10:13.333 --> 10:14.542
No!

10:14.542 --> 10:16.542
Just for one second!

10:18.792 --> 10:20.500
Fuck.

10:20.500 --> 10:24.708
Yeah, I cannot believe that
you got to rent out La Vue
on a Friday night.

10:24.708 --> 10:26.708
That must have
cost you a fortune.

10:26.708 --> 10:30.083
Well, let's just say
the owner owed me a favor
for fucking him.

10:30.083 --> 10:32.667
- Ah, nice.
- Good Lord.

10:32.667 --> 10:35.291
Oh, Marnie,
don't be such a prude.

10:35.291 --> 10:36.667
( laughing )

10:36.667 --> 10:39.083
Yo. We sound checking
or what?

10:39.083 --> 10:41.083
Yeah, I'm just, um,
waiting on my partner
still.

10:41.083 --> 10:44.000
I gotta split.
I gotta pick my girl up
from the hospital.

10:44.000 --> 10:46.542
Why don't you
just get her an Uber?

10:46.542 --> 10:47.792
He's not here
in five minutes,
I bounce.

10:47.792 --> 10:49.417
- Wow.
- For very real.

10:49.417 --> 10:51.708
- Marnie: All right, dude.
- I'll talk to him.

10:51.708 --> 10:54.125
Yeah, I'll talk
to him, too.
Aah!

10:54.125 --> 10:56.208
Mom, that is gross.

11:06.208 --> 11:07.542
Well...

11:07.542 --> 11:09.708
you are basically
an hour late.

11:09.708 --> 11:11.542
( scoffs )

11:13.083 --> 11:14.500
Marn,

11:14.500 --> 11:16.208
you're lucky
I came at all.

11:16.208 --> 11:17.750
Oh, yes,
I'm so grateful

11:17.750 --> 11:20.041
that you showed up
to your motherfucking job.

11:20.041 --> 11:22.000
This isn't my job.

11:22.000 --> 11:23.583
I did not sign up
for all of this.

11:23.583 --> 11:26.125
Well, you signed a contract
with a record label

11:26.125 --> 11:28.333
and then you opted
to do a tristate tour,

11:28.333 --> 11:31.083
so I don't really know
what you thought you
were signing up for.

11:31.083 --> 11:33.250
( mumbling )

11:33.250 --> 11:34.750
Desi?

11:34.750 --> 11:36.208
Desi.

11:36.208 --> 11:38.375
( snapping )
What the fuck
is wrong with you?

11:38.375 --> 11:41.667
I can't believe
I'm in fucking New Jersey
right now.

11:41.667 --> 11:43.583
Did you get any sleep
last night?

11:43.583 --> 11:45.250
( groaning )

11:45.250 --> 11:46.750
What am I doing?

11:46.750 --> 11:49.458
Oh, my God.
Okay.

11:49.458 --> 11:53.125
If you actually care
about being a musician,

11:53.125 --> 11:55.667
I feel like
you need to start
showing up places,

11:55.667 --> 11:56.667
doing this shit--

11:56.667 --> 11:58.959
I'm not a musician, bella.

11:58.959 --> 12:00.458
You're not?

12:00.458 --> 12:02.250
Never have been.

12:02.250 --> 12:05.000
I was just acting like one.

12:05.000 --> 12:09.375
Before that,
I was just acting
like being an actor.

12:09.375 --> 12:11.375
Before that,
I was just acting like

12:11.375 --> 12:13.458
being a big game
photographer.

12:13.458 --> 12:16.667
I'm always acting
like I'm something,

12:16.667 --> 12:18.708
but now I'm, like...

12:18.708 --> 12:20.875
done.

12:20.875 --> 12:22.792
What happened to you?

12:26.291 --> 12:27.625
So gorgeous.

12:27.625 --> 12:28.750
You've gotta get down here
and see his biceps.

12:28.750 --> 12:29.750
It's unbelievable.

12:29.750 --> 12:31.041
What's wrong with you?

12:31.041 --> 12:32.417
- Let's do this.
- Let me call you back.

12:32.417 --> 12:34.458
- No, no, no. What's--
- Hey...

12:34.458 --> 12:36.875
What is
your problem?

12:36.875 --> 12:38.750
Oh...

12:38.750 --> 12:40.417
He is really high.

12:40.417 --> 12:42.750
Are you fucking high?

12:42.750 --> 12:47.000
Marnie, you should really
know what a high person
looks like by now.

12:47.000 --> 12:49.542
Oh, God.
I can't believe
you married that jerk.

12:49.542 --> 12:51.000
Oh, my God, Mom.

12:51.000 --> 12:53.458
I married that jerk
because of the way
you raised me.

12:53.458 --> 12:55.166
Uh, what are you
talking about?

12:55.166 --> 12:59.166
Everything you ever did
was for a man.

12:59.166 --> 13:01.583
You realize
you basically pushed me
to get married, right?

13:01.583 --> 13:03.667
Because the only thing
that ever mattered

13:03.667 --> 13:05.792
in our fucking household
was male approval.

13:05.792 --> 13:08.667
- Wha--
- And now I find myself
on the wrong side of my 20s...

13:08.667 --> 13:11.458
- Oh. Aww.
- ...without a stead job
or a relationship.

13:11.458 --> 13:14.750
And Hannah is having a baby
and I will need to be there
for her.

13:14.750 --> 13:17.417
And you two
are preventing me
from becoming

13:17.417 --> 13:20.208
the godmother
that I need to be.

13:21.458 --> 13:23.083
Hannah's having a baby?

13:23.083 --> 13:24.542
Yeah.

13:24.542 --> 13:27.333
( scoffs )
That's a mistake.

13:27.333 --> 13:30.125
Hannah:
I just kind of think
it's, like, a lose-lose, okay?

13:30.125 --> 13:32.917
If I tell him
and he doesn't want to be
part of the child's life,

13:32.917 --> 13:35.125
he's just gonna feel
this, like, undue burden
of having a child.

13:35.125 --> 13:37.917
And if I tell him
and he does, then what
I am I gonna do?

13:37.917 --> 13:39.875
'Cause I don't wanna sound
classist or whatever,

13:39.875 --> 13:43.875
but I'm not raising
my child half the year
on an all-inclusive resort.

13:43.875 --> 13:46.208
I'm just gonna,
like, treat him like
a sperm donor, okay?

13:46.208 --> 13:48.208
And sperm donors
traditionally
are not told.

13:48.208 --> 13:49.708
Yeah, that's a good point.

13:49.708 --> 13:51.959
Well, you know,
as someone who was
a sperm donor,

13:51.959 --> 13:56.750
I can tell you
I certainly did want to be
a part of that child's life.

13:56.750 --> 13:58.917
Do you have a kid,
Keith?

13:58.917 --> 14:00.750
Sadly, no.

14:00.750 --> 14:03.083
You know,
my lesbian friends,
Aminy and Roni--

14:03.083 --> 14:05.333
you met them, Tad,
the pot roast people.

14:05.333 --> 14:06.417
Pot roast.

14:06.417 --> 14:07.708
They wanted
to use my sperm,

14:07.708 --> 14:09.125
but it didn't
work out.

14:09.125 --> 14:11.333
Anyway, after they
started trying,

14:11.333 --> 14:13.542
they told me
they didn't want
to tell the child

14:13.542 --> 14:16.083
that I was the father,
and it was extremely
upsetting.

14:16.083 --> 14:19.083
I mean, that person
would have been a part
of my life.

14:19.083 --> 14:21.500
But, honey, this story
is different.

14:21.500 --> 14:23.250
The man Hannah
lay with

14:23.250 --> 14:27.417
wasn't having sex
with the intent
to make a child.

14:27.417 --> 14:30.625
Nothing about his life
projects the idea that
he wants a child.

14:30.625 --> 14:32.667
Well, it still
doesn't change the fact

14:32.667 --> 14:36.750
that the child
will be his.

14:36.750 --> 14:39.125
Hannah's already decided.
It's her body.

14:39.125 --> 14:41.583
I think we all need
to do exactly

14:41.583 --> 14:43.417
what we feel
is right for us.

14:43.417 --> 14:45.542
I clearly
learned that lesson
the hard way.

14:45.542 --> 14:48.208
Oh, come on,
you can't equate
what Hannah's doing

14:48.208 --> 14:50.041
with your lifetime denial
of being a gay man.

14:50.041 --> 14:52.083
They both involve
personal freedom.

14:52.083 --> 14:53.834
You guys don't have
to get worked up about--

14:53.834 --> 14:56.625
As a mother,
Hannah has to decide
what's best for the baby.

14:56.625 --> 14:59.125
And not telling the father
is what she's decided
is best.

14:59.125 --> 15:01.291
Are you going
to tell every mother
how to raise their child?

15:01.291 --> 15:04.208
I just don't think
she has enough information

15:04.208 --> 15:05.875
to make a fair decision.

15:05.875 --> 15:07.875
She doesn't know
who this guy is,

15:07.875 --> 15:09.125
what he wants.

15:09.125 --> 15:10.375
I have a pretty good sense
of who he is.

15:10.375 --> 15:11.792
He wears, like,
a puka shell necklace

15:11.792 --> 15:14.458
and his days off
are Thursday and Tuesday.

15:14.458 --> 15:17.792
Your mother tells me you're
the next Jennifer Lopez
minus the acting chops.

15:17.792 --> 15:20.750
Yeah, that's exactly
how I want people
to describe me.

15:20.750 --> 15:22.875
I was in a ska band
when I was your age.

15:22.875 --> 15:24.166
Mm.

15:24.166 --> 15:26.375
- It was the time of my life.
- So fun.

15:26.375 --> 15:28.291
- And then guess what.
- What?

15:28.291 --> 15:30.834
It got even better.
( laughing )

15:30.834 --> 15:34.000
Anyway, for me,
like, being in a band
is mostly stressful

15:34.000 --> 15:36.375
because, like,
it's my only livelihood.

15:36.375 --> 15:40.041
Totally.
I remember when we were
touring with the Fugees,

15:40.041 --> 15:43.041
I was so messed up,
I got on the wrong bus

15:43.041 --> 15:45.250
and had to hitchhike
through Hungary.

15:45.250 --> 15:48.208
- Wait, uh--
- It can get stressful
for sure.

15:48.208 --> 15:50.000
You toured with the Fugees?

15:50.000 --> 15:52.166
- Just for a year.
- Yeah, she dated Pras.

15:52.166 --> 15:55.375
Wow, sounds like you got
a lot further than I have.

15:55.375 --> 15:58.041
Well, if you're half
as good as your mother says,

15:58.041 --> 15:59.250
you'll get there.

15:59.250 --> 16:01.250
I'm excited
to hear your sound.

16:01.250 --> 16:04.417
Oh, yeah. I'm bummed
it can't be tonight,
but maybe some other time.

16:04.417 --> 16:07.041
We have some other gigs,
maybe, soon.

16:07.041 --> 16:09.291
- What?
- Oh, you haven't heard.

16:09.291 --> 16:10.792
My musical counterpart

16:10.792 --> 16:13.166
overdosed on some kind of,
like, heavy narcotic.

16:13.166 --> 16:15.792
I don't know.
Anyway, I can't really
do it without him.

16:15.792 --> 16:18.041
She's kidding.
You know, like,
rock 'n' roll humor.

16:18.041 --> 16:19.792
Aah!

16:19.792 --> 16:22.708
- No, I'm not--
- So, listen, why don't
I help you set up?

16:22.708 --> 16:24.708
I think
it's about time to--
yeah, let's go.

16:24.708 --> 16:26.875
- You're not wearing a watch.
- Well, I know what time it is.

16:26.875 --> 16:28.959
Listen to me.

16:28.959 --> 16:32.166
I convinced Sharva
to book you over
JC Chasez,

16:32.166 --> 16:33.667
so you have to perform.

16:33.667 --> 16:35.417
No, Mom, I'm sorry.
There's nothing I can do.

16:35.417 --> 16:37.500
Desi's completely
incapacitated.

16:37.500 --> 16:38.917
I'm bummed out, too.

16:38.917 --> 16:41.375
Um... holy shit!

16:41.375 --> 16:42.959
I can do this!

16:42.959 --> 16:45.083
- What?
- I know enough
of your chords.

16:45.083 --> 16:46.583
I've memorized
all the lyrics,

16:46.583 --> 16:48.917
so I can back you up,
Marnie!

16:48.917 --> 16:50.083
Fuck, no.

16:50.083 --> 16:52.000
Oh, no.
Fuck, yes!

16:52.000 --> 16:55.708
Why the fuck
do we stay open
till 10:00 PM?

16:55.708 --> 16:57.625
Anyone who's buying
leather gloves after 6:00

16:57.625 --> 16:59.125
is clearly
a goddamn murderer.

16:59.125 --> 17:02.667
I know.
And I have an audition
at 9:00 in the morning.

17:02.667 --> 17:04.834
Actually,
since we're stuck here,

17:04.834 --> 17:06.083
would you
run lines with me?

17:06.083 --> 17:08.916
Just once through
to make sure I know it.

17:08.916 --> 17:10.375
Fine.

17:10.375 --> 17:13.625
You're Dustin because
I'm Lavinia, obviously.

17:15.416 --> 17:17.290
Okay.

17:19.083 --> 17:20.250
Oh, dark.

17:22.083 --> 17:25.500
- Okay.
- So, you walk in
shell-shocked.

17:25.500 --> 17:26.625
And... go.

17:29.208 --> 17:31.667
Lavinia?

17:31.667 --> 17:33.166
Lavinia, are you home?

17:33.166 --> 17:34.625
Dinner's almost ready.

17:36.959 --> 17:38.417
Dustin?

17:38.417 --> 17:39.959
Is something wrong?

17:41.625 --> 17:44.708
It was so dark,
I didn't...

17:44.708 --> 17:45.834
I didn't see her.

17:45.834 --> 17:47.750
She just-- she came
out of nowhere.

17:47.750 --> 17:50.291
Dustin,
what's going on?

17:50.291 --> 17:52.542
There was a little girl...

17:52.542 --> 17:54.583
Well, what?
Tell me what happened!
What did you do?

17:54.583 --> 17:56.959
I hit her.

17:56.959 --> 17:59.625
I turned the corner
and-- and she was
just there.

17:59.625 --> 18:00.959
I-- I don't know.

18:00.959 --> 18:02.583
Well, is she all right?

18:02.583 --> 18:04.834
I panicked.
I was so-- I was so close.

18:04.834 --> 18:06.667
I-- I was so close
to home.

18:06.667 --> 18:09.333
I couldn't focus,
so I just came here.

18:09.333 --> 18:12.333
You ran?
You hit a little girl
and ran?

18:12.333 --> 18:15.166
I couldn't stay!
I stopped by a bar.

18:15.166 --> 18:17.125
After work.

18:17.125 --> 18:19.750
I had one drink,
but maybe--

18:19.750 --> 18:21.500
Maybe it was strong?
I don't--

18:21.500 --> 18:22.667
Well, is she dead?

18:22.667 --> 18:24.000
Did I get
that line right?

18:24.000 --> 18:25.000
Yeah.

18:25.000 --> 18:26.834
Dustin,
did you kill her?

18:26.834 --> 18:28.291
I don't know!

18:28.291 --> 18:30.583
Well, what were you
doing at a bar?

18:30.583 --> 18:33.291
I was there
to meet a woman.

18:33.291 --> 18:35.458
( gasps )
What?

18:37.667 --> 18:39.125
My whole life...

18:41.959 --> 18:43.834
My whole life is...

18:43.834 --> 18:45.000
is gone.

18:47.500 --> 18:49.708
I had one bad moment
and...

18:51.542 --> 18:53.041
now it's gone.

18:54.125 --> 18:55.500
( scoffs )

18:55.500 --> 18:57.875
Jesus, man,
you're fucking good.

18:57.875 --> 19:00.208
Oh, thanks.

19:00.208 --> 19:03.166
Hey, when you do
the "And what?"

19:03.166 --> 19:05.500
do it here,

19:05.500 --> 19:07.208
but don't do it here.

19:07.208 --> 19:09.125
- Do you know what I mean?
Like...
- Um...

19:09.125 --> 19:11.542
Like to say it,
but don't say it.

19:13.417 --> 19:15.041
( knocking )

19:15.041 --> 19:16.542
Hello?

19:16.542 --> 19:18.875
Jessa:
It's me.

19:18.875 --> 19:20.041
Fuck.

19:30.625 --> 19:32.333
You're pregnant?

19:32.333 --> 19:35.917
Yeah, and I also have
a lot of work to do,
so I can't really...

19:35.917 --> 19:37.417
Can I come in?

19:37.417 --> 19:39.083
Fine.

19:49.291 --> 19:51.834
I'm hurt.

19:51.834 --> 19:54.583
It's just really fucking sad
to hear it from Adam.

19:54.583 --> 19:57.208
Well, if it makes you
feel any better, I really
didn't want to tell him.

19:57.208 --> 19:59.417
He was just following me
down my block.

19:59.417 --> 20:00.917
Why didn't you call me?

20:00.917 --> 20:03.667
Do I really have to answer
that question for you, Jessa?

20:03.667 --> 20:05.792
( sighs )

20:05.792 --> 20:07.417
All right, Hannah.

20:10.708 --> 20:12.542
Listen.

20:12.542 --> 20:15.291
Regardless of everything
that happened,

20:15.291 --> 20:17.250
you are still
my dear friend.

20:17.250 --> 20:19.250
I can try
and forget about you.

20:19.250 --> 20:21.250
It just doesn't work.

20:22.750 --> 20:24.959
Will you please
be quiet?

20:24.959 --> 20:27.083
I mean, come on.
Your "dear friend"?

20:27.083 --> 20:30.125
We haven't acted like
friends in a long time.
In fact, maybe not ever.

20:30.125 --> 20:32.458
I don't think we ever
acted like real friends.

20:32.458 --> 20:35.333
Seriously, Hannah?

20:35.333 --> 20:38.834
You can't just
detach yourself
from a relationship.

20:38.834 --> 20:40.625
Unless you're
some kind of...

20:40.625 --> 20:42.917
psychopath.

20:42.917 --> 20:46.000
Well, maybe you're
a psychopath for just
coming over here.

20:46.000 --> 20:48.417
And how are you
gonna be a therapist
if you can't even figure out

20:48.417 --> 20:50.583
what's going on in your
own life, which is that
I clearly didn't tell you

20:50.583 --> 20:53.166
for a reason,
which is that I don't
care what you think.

20:53.166 --> 20:54.834
And I don't care
about your feelings

20:54.834 --> 20:57.458
'cause I don't really care
about you anymore, Jessa.

20:57.458 --> 21:00.208
Okay.
All right, so...

21:00.208 --> 21:01.667
how's this
gonna work, then?

21:01.667 --> 21:02.834
What's the plan?

21:02.834 --> 21:05.083
So I'm just
gonna leave here

21:05.083 --> 21:07.083
and then you and I
are gonna figure out
some way

21:07.083 --> 21:08.583
that we don't ever
see each other again.

21:08.583 --> 21:09.667
That's the plan, huh?

21:11.750 --> 21:13.959
So, bye.

21:13.959 --> 21:15.166
Bye.

21:23.000 --> 21:25.417
And for the record,

21:25.417 --> 21:27.667
I am a sociopath.

21:27.667 --> 21:30.500
But you are
a fucking psychopath.

21:30.500 --> 21:33.875
And it's so much worse.

21:33.875 --> 21:37.083
Everything that we did
together happened,

21:37.083 --> 21:39.208
whether you want
to believe it or not.

21:39.208 --> 21:41.542
Whether you want
to remember it or not.

21:41.542 --> 21:45.500
And I am here
and I know you.

21:45.500 --> 21:47.917
You can't
just erase people.

21:47.917 --> 21:50.208
You can't just erase me.

21:50.208 --> 21:51.708
That's not how it works.

21:51.708 --> 21:53.667
I don't care anymore.

21:57.708 --> 21:59.333
Rest in peace.

( grunting )

24:29.625 --> 24:31.000
Elijah:
I mean,

24:31.000 --> 24:33.041
even if you're
amazing at something,

24:33.041 --> 24:36.083
that doesn't necessarily mean
that you should do it, right?

24:36.083 --> 24:38.208
And if I'm saying that
I'm a Broadway-caliber actor,

24:38.208 --> 24:39.542
shouldn't I only be
auditioning for things

24:39.542 --> 24:41.667
that would take place
on Broadway?

24:41.667 --> 24:43.625
I mean, the only reason
I would actually do it

24:43.625 --> 24:46.166
is because it would be,
like, a favor to Padgett,

24:46.166 --> 24:48.250
because Padgett
was like, "Oh, Elijah,

24:48.250 --> 24:50.458
you reinvented the form.

24:50.458 --> 24:53.291
I can't imagine this part
being even played
by anyone else.

24:53.291 --> 24:55.417
I feel like
you're the only one
who could do it.

24:55.417 --> 24:57.417
It's probably
not even gonna happen
if you don't say yes."

24:57.417 --> 24:59.834
So, I was like,
"Jesus, Padgett,
calm down.

24:59.834 --> 25:02.291
Like, yes,
I'll maybe think about it,

25:02.291 --> 25:04.959
but I just don't
know if it's the best use
of my time right now."

25:04.959 --> 25:08.250
And, plus,
I'm a little on the fence
with her commitment...

25:09.625 --> 25:11.959
But it's veggie patty
night.

25:11.959 --> 25:14.542
Who are we if we don't stick
to our commitments?

25:30.250 --> 25:32.500
Yeah, I'm looking
for Paul-Louis.

25:32.500 --> 25:35.834
I believe he's the head
of the water skiing department.

25:35.834 --> 25:39.041
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm remote.
I'm just an operator.

25:39.041 --> 25:40.542
You know what?
I'm just gonna try you back.

25:40.542 --> 25:42.375
Don't even--
just forget it.

25:54.917 --> 25:56.458
( keyboard clicking )

26:03.125 --> 26:04.708
- ( moaning )
- Oh, fuck!

26:04.708 --> 26:06.125
Your pussy's
too tight.

26:06.125 --> 26:07.458
You have to fix it.

26:07.458 --> 26:09.041
You have to fix it
with your cock.

26:09.041 --> 26:11.000
( both panting, grunting )

26:12.792 --> 26:14.500
Great, it's porno.

26:17.291 --> 26:18.917
Mira:
Jesus.

26:18.917 --> 26:20.291
( panting )

26:20.291 --> 26:22.041
You make me feel
so good.

26:22.041 --> 26:24.125
I think you make me
feel too good.

26:25.667 --> 26:27.750
You say that
like it's a bad thing.

26:27.750 --> 26:29.625
Well, maybe it is.

26:31.875 --> 26:33.166
Why?

26:34.458 --> 26:37.000
Adam:
I break things, Mira.

26:38.792 --> 26:40.667
That's what I do.

26:40.667 --> 26:42.542
It's why I avoided you
for so long,

26:42.542 --> 26:44.125
'cause I didn't wanna
break you.

26:45.500 --> 26:46.875
( exhales )

26:48.291 --> 26:49.834
But this, now...

26:51.417 --> 26:53.667
so perfect,
it scares me a little.

26:55.291 --> 26:57.417
Mira:
The only time
I've ever felt perfect

26:57.417 --> 27:00.792
is when I'm with you,
and you're telling me
I'm perfect.

27:00.792 --> 27:05.166
I wish we could stay
right here forever.

27:06.500 --> 27:08.208
That's a nice idea.

27:09.792 --> 27:13.375
But I don't wanna
get a UTI...

27:13.375 --> 27:14.834

We met a few months ago.
I was writing this article

29:22.375 --> 29:24.000
about the surf camp...

29:25.166 --> 29:26.750
I threw up in your bed...

29:27.166 --> 29:29.083
Elijah Krantz?
We're ready for you.

29:29.083 --> 29:31.458
Can I have, like, thirty seconds
to go to the bathroom?

29:31.834 --> 29:32.625
Not really.

29:32.875 --> 29:35.959
♪ (UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING) ♪

29:37.875 --> 29:43.208
♪ (SCATTING OVER
ACOUSTIC GUITAR) ♪

29:47.291 --> 29:48.875
This episode is called
"Full Disclosure."

29:48.875 --> 29:51.000
It was written by Murray Miller.
What a gem of a man.

29:51.458 --> 29:52.333
I'll talk to him.

29:52.834 --> 29:54.917
Yeah, I'll talk to him too.
(JEERS)

29:54.917 --> 29:56.500
And Murray obviously named
Sharva Pontemucci.

29:56.500 --> 29:58.041
-(LAUGHTER)
-LENA: We loved the idea

29:58.041 --> 30:00.083
that Rita has basically
a funkier social life

30:00.083 --> 30:02.417
than Marnie, and that, like,
Sharva Pontemucci's like

30:02.417 --> 30:04.917
the hottest thing
on the New Jersey social scene.

30:04.917 --> 30:07.917
I convinced Sharva to book you
over J.C. Chasez!

30:07.917 --> 30:10.834
And then meanwhile, Marnie is
in a hell of her own creation.

30:10.834 --> 30:14.959
Marnie watching her mother scat
and seeing the Michaels sisters

30:14.959 --> 30:18.667
as her future is truly her
lowest moment on  Girls  ever.

30:18.667 --> 30:20.041
It's not the sex,
it's not the drugs,

30:20.041 --> 30:22.542
-it's her mom scatting.
-Yes. (LAUGHS)

30:22.542 --> 30:25.166
And then meanwhile, this is
the episode in which

30:25.166 --> 30:27.834
Hannah's also receiving pressure
to give a call

30:27.834 --> 30:29.125
to the father of the baby.

30:29.125 --> 30:30.917
-You're pregnant?
-That's a mistake?

30:30.917 --> 30:32.875
You are obviously going
to tell him eventually.

30:32.875 --> 30:34.792
Hannah's already decided.
It's her body.

30:34.792 --> 30:37.208
It sort of sends everyone
spinning when they find out

30:37.208 --> 30:39.166
the information, and they all
take it very personally.

30:39.500 --> 30:41.542
-Is it Jan's?
-No, it's not Fran's.

30:42.000 --> 30:43.250
Okay, it's not important
who it is,

30:44.291 --> 30:46.417
I don't know if I want him
to be part of the kid's life,
I might not even tell him.

30:46.417 --> 30:47.917
-You can't do that.
-Well, I'm doin' it.

30:48.125 --> 30:51.875
But I think for Adam,
he realizes that they have some

30:51.875 --> 30:55.417
unfinished business, and it
throws him for a crazy loop.

30:55.417 --> 30:57.083
Yeah, and I think that's
the moment that he starts to

30:57.083 --> 30:59.917
consider whether not being
with Hannah is a mistake.

31:00.083 --> 31:00.875
Fuck.

31:01.667 --> 31:04.166
What's complicated is when you
meet someone in your 20s

31:04.166 --> 31:07.500
and you love them,
but it's also full of conflict.

31:07.500 --> 31:08.792
You don't know if you're
supposed to go

31:09.208 --> 31:11.583
and look in the great ocean
of life, or if you're just

31:11.583 --> 31:13.166
supposed to hold
onto a connection with someone,

31:13.166 --> 31:14.917
because connections are
few and far between.

31:15.250 --> 31:17.208
And I think one of the reasons
it's been so hard for her

31:17.208 --> 31:18.959
to let go of her relationship
with Adam, is because she does

31:18.959 --> 31:21.125
have really real feelings
and deep sympathy and love

31:21.125 --> 31:23.834
for him, and isn't sure if she's
gonna find that exact set

31:23.834 --> 31:26.000
of feelings again,
if she goes looking.

31:26.375 --> 31:27.750
Why are you avoiding it so hard?

31:28.041 --> 31:29.959
It's not a big commitment,
it's just under 47 minutes.

31:30.208 --> 31:32.875
She does not want to watch
his film and I've always thought

31:32.875 --> 31:33.792
the reason she doesn't is:

31:34.500 --> 31:36.166
"I write about people
all the time and I would never

31:36.166 --> 31:37.333
wanna read someone else's essay
about me."

31:37.792 --> 31:39.458
She's sort of like,
"No, that's my job, to talk

31:39.458 --> 31:41.208
about our relationship.
I'm not interested

31:41.208 --> 31:42.458
in hearing your perspective
on it.

31:42.458 --> 31:44.625
(MOANING FROM LAPTOP)

31:44.625 --> 31:46.250
JENNI: I remember Judd
pitching the joke,

31:46.250 --> 31:48.125
"When Hannah watches it, it's
like when anyone else

31:48.125 --> 31:50.667
watches Girls,  like,
it's like, 'This is porn.'"

31:50.667 --> 31:52.041
(LAUGHS) Yeah, totally.

31:52.250 --> 31:54.500
Our kids are gonna have
great skin and be the right kind

31:54.500 --> 31:55.417
of slutty.

31:55.417 --> 31:56.750
-"Our" kid!
-Mm-hmm.

31:57.000 --> 31:59.500
Just to give you a little
Elijah history. Lena and I

31:59.500 --> 32:02.041
had seen  Book of Mormon
on opening night,

32:02.041 --> 32:05.750
so when Andrew walked in
to read for Elijah,

32:05.750 --> 32:07.625
it was like The Beatles
came into the room.

32:07.625 --> 32:09.792
We were like,
"Oh, my God! It's him!"

32:09.792 --> 32:10.834
We were so excited.

32:11.041 --> 32:12.708
It was really like falling
in love.

32:12.708 --> 32:15.083
Like, Andrew and I have
a very special like...

32:15.083 --> 32:16.708
dynamic when we're acting
together,

32:16.708 --> 32:18.333
I mean, he could have chemistry
with a stump of wood,

32:18.500 --> 32:22.000
but we do really have fun being
Elijah and Hannah, together.

32:22.166 --> 32:24.000
Or, as some people
on the internet call them,

32:24.000 --> 32:25.208
-"Hanlijah."
-(LAUGHS)

32:25.208 --> 32:26.083
LENA: Which I love!

32:26.750 --> 32:28.834
To be clear, I'm not offering
to pay for anything.

32:28.834 --> 32:29.959
-Nothing?
-No.

32:31.208 --> 32:33.834
-(BELL RINGS)
-I'm calling the police!

32:34.208 --> 32:36.458
It was really a pleasure
every time we filmed

32:36.458 --> 32:38.583
the movie within the show
scenes.

32:38.583 --> 32:41.000
And trivia, I actually wrote
that scene between them

32:41.000 --> 32:44.291
as a flashback episode in
Season 2, that was unanimously

32:44.291 --> 32:45.959
-shot down by everybody
-(LAUGHS)

32:45.959 --> 32:47.542
as the worst episode
in Girls  history.

32:47.875 --> 32:51.250
Another piece of trivia is that
in the original writing of that,

32:51.250 --> 32:52.375
he's not wearing a shirt.

32:53.083 --> 32:55.625
-LENA: He's shirtless, working--
-JENNI: At an outfit store.

32:55.625 --> 32:58.375
And Jenni was like, "Even for
our movie within a movie,"

32:58.375 --> 32:59.917
-(JENNI LAUGHS)
-LENA: "we cannot do that."

33:00.250 --> 33:01.875
-Ow.
-Good.

33:02.041 --> 33:02.834
What?

33:03.208 --> 33:04.875
If it hurts,
you'll always remember.

33:04.875 --> 33:07.083
I think that's truthfully
the way it went down.

33:07.083 --> 33:08.750
I think the dialogue
was different.

33:08.750 --> 33:10.500
I don't think he found out
she was a writer

33:10.500 --> 33:13.583
until, probably like, four
sexual sessions later, but--

33:13.583 --> 33:16.041
Sexual sessions!
The Sexual Sessions.

33:16.041 --> 33:19.542
The Sexual Sessions,
our new spin-off on HBO.

33:19.542 --> 33:21.708
-...on HBO, coming next week.
-(JENNI LAUGHS)
