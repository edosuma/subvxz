00:06.830 --> 00:07.956
The forecast,

00:07.960 --> 00:10.201
plenty of sunshine through today
with seasonal temperatures.

00:10.210 --> 00:13.577
We should reach our normal high
of about 82 degrees by this afternoon.

00:13.580 --> 00:14.706
PALM BEACH, FLORIDA

00:14.710 --> 00:17.031
Look for clear skies tonight
with a low near 70.

00:17.040 --> 00:19.417
Increasing cloudiness tomorrow,
sticlq and humid.

00:19.420 --> 00:21.160
A 20% chance of showers.

00:31.670 --> 00:32.705
Clurman!

00:39.790 --> 00:42.281
Why haven't you
returned my calls, Gil?

00:42.290 --> 00:44.372
Come on, Joe. Give me a break.
I'm late for a meeting.

00:44.380 --> 00:48.032
I left messages on every line.
I even talked with your assistant.

00:48.040 --> 00:49.280
Look, I've been really busy, okay?

00:49.290 --> 00:51.667
We have a meeting scheduled
tomorrow. We'll talk then, okay?

00:51.670 --> 00:53.285
That's right, we will.

00:53.750 --> 00:56.662
You blow me off again,
it's gonna get ugly.

00:56.670 --> 00:59.207
And I won't be so understanding
next time.

01:34.920 --> 01:36.615
Clurman's was the second
bombing this mornIng.

01:36.620 --> 01:37.780
F.B.I., Behavioral Analysis Unit
QUANTICO, VIRGINIA

01:37.790 --> 01:39.200
Both in residential neighborhoods
in Palm Beach.

01:39.210 --> 01:41.451
-Homeland Security been notified?
-And ATF.

01:41.460 --> 01:43.416
In addition to a profile,
they want a threat assessment.

01:43.420 --> 01:44.739
-Is the media on to it?
-Of course.

01:44.750 --> 01:47.913
-JJ's keeping tabs on that.
-What do we know about the bombs?

01:47.920 --> 01:49.376
Morgan hooked up with ATF.

01:49.380 --> 01:52.872
They're sending pictures of bomb
fragments as they find them.

01:54.540 --> 01:55.700
Pipe bombs.

01:55.710 --> 01:57.826
-Packed in cardboard boxes.
-Package bombs.

01:57.830 --> 01:59.457
-Sent through the mail?
-No.

01:59.460 --> 02:01.917
The other picture in your hand
is of the switch that ATF found.

02:01.920 --> 02:04.536
Same mechanism for both bombs.
Mercury-activated.

02:04.540 --> 02:05.666
What does that mean?

02:05.670 --> 02:07.160
There are contacts to a detonator

02:07.170 --> 02:09.377
on either end of a bent tube
full of mercury.

02:09.380 --> 02:11.951
What it means is all you have to do
is tilt the package to detonate it.

02:11.960 --> 02:13.746
So they couldn't have been
sent through the mail.

02:13.750 --> 02:15.661
The bomber had to
deliver them himself.

02:15.670 --> 02:16.819
Exactly.

02:16.830 --> 02:18.240
Strange way
to commit an act of terrorism.

02:18.250 --> 02:20.411
Why go to all this trouble
to kill just a few people?

02:20.420 --> 02:23.708
Let's recommend not raising
the terror alert level for now.

02:23.710 --> 02:26.577
-No reason to spread panic.
-We got news.

02:27.670 --> 02:30.821
This is just a local channel,
but the coverage is everywhere now.

02:30.830 --> 02:33.412
CNN, Fox, MSNBC,
Al Jazeera, you name it.

02:33.420 --> 02:35.035
So much for not spreading panic.

02:35.040 --> 02:37.031
According to doctors, he's badly injured

02:37.040 --> 02:39.452
but in stable condition in the ICU.

02:39.460 --> 02:42.918
30 this morning,

02:42.920 --> 02:44.069
and police arrived shortly...

02:44.080 --> 02:46.457
If DHS doesn't raise the terror alert
now, they'll look weak.

02:46.460 --> 02:49.327
Make sure Homeland Security knows
that this is everywhere.

02:49.330 --> 02:50.706
Now police are investigating...

02:50.710 --> 02:51.916
Whoa.

02:51.920 --> 02:53.490
I just felt that... Are you...

02:53.500 --> 02:56.037
Are you all right

02:56.040 --> 02:58.110
-Do they need help?-Looks like we're going to Palm Beach.

02:58.120 --> 02:59.246
Let's meet at the airstrip in 20.

02:59.250 --> 03:00.490
Ladies and gentlemen, this is live.

03:00.500 --> 03:03.207
I repeat, this is live.
There's been another...

03:41.000 --> 03:43.036
-Yeah, we're set.
-Hotch, listen.

03:43.040 --> 03:45.326
They're gonna be sending us
bomb fragments by this afternoon.

03:45.330 --> 03:46.991
I'm the only one
with an ATF background.

03:47.000 --> 03:48.240
So, if you'd like me to stay behind

03:48.250 --> 03:49.911
to supervise the bomb profile,
I'm on that.

03:49.920 --> 03:51.035
Morgan, you wouldn't be afraid

03:51.040 --> 03:53.611
to be out in the ﬁeld
with a bomber now, would you?

03:53.620 --> 03:56.532
You know, maybe it's not the bomber
that I'm worried about.

03:56.540 --> 03:57.916
I thought we were past all that.

03:57.920 --> 04:00.662
Hotch, Boston sent Gideon
into a post-traumatic tailspin.

04:00.670 --> 04:01.989
How do we know _
that won't happen agaIn?

04:02.000 --> 04:03.115
Morgan, I'll tell you what.

04:03.120 --> 04:06.749
Why don't we concentrate on profiling
the bomber and not Gideon?

04:08.540 --> 04:09.700
Copy that.

04:12.750 --> 04:16.993
Samuel Johnson wrote,
"Almost all absurdity of conduct

04:17.000 --> 04:22.199
"arises from the imitation of those
whom we cannot resemble."

04:22.620 --> 04:24.531
Bombings occurred
within three miles of each other.

04:24.540 --> 04:27.282
First victim was a 74-year-old widow,
Barbara Keller.

04:27.290 --> 04:30.453
Two hours after that,
Clurman got hit in his driveway,

04:30.460 --> 04:33.873
and 45 minutes later,
well, we all saw that.

04:33.880 --> 04:35.825
Jill Swenson, 34-year-old housewife

04:35.830 --> 04:37.457
who lived across the street
from Clurman.

04:37.460 --> 04:39.701
Of the three, only Clurman survived.

04:39.710 --> 04:41.450
Is there any connection
between the victims?

04:41.460 --> 04:45.032
One. Clurman was a partner in
a $10-million condo development deal

04:45.040 --> 04:46.416
in which Keller was an investor.

04:46.420 --> 04:48.320
And a few weeks ago,
the whole deal went bust.

04:48.330 --> 04:49.490
Went bust how?

04:49.500 --> 04:51.991
Geologists discovered
that the land was on methane,

04:52.000 --> 04:54.571
the condos never got built,
the land became worthless

04:54.580 --> 04:56.787
and Clurman lost a lot of people
a lot of money.

04:56.790 --> 04:58.951
So maybe one of them was mad
enough to take aim at Clurman.

04:58.960 --> 05:00.609
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.

05:00.620 --> 05:03.282
It's a little too early
to theorize about motive.

05:03.290 --> 05:04.996
Then, where do we start?

05:05.000 --> 05:06.570
From the beginning.

05:06.580 --> 05:08.116
What do we know about bombers?

05:08.120 --> 05:11.874
Mostly male, loners.
History of criminal activity.

05:11.880 --> 05:15.532
About 50 percent of all bombings
are actually the product of vandalism.

05:15.540 --> 05:18.612
And more often than not, bombers end
up accidentally blowing themselves up.

05:18.620 --> 05:19.746
So the first suspects

05:19.750 --> 05:21.570
you always look for
in a bombing case are the victims.

05:21.580 --> 05:23.036
Clurman was the only male.

05:23.040 --> 05:27.113
Losing a large business deal like that,
it could be a powerful stressor.

05:28.540 --> 05:30.371
Well, then there's the crime scene.

05:30.380 --> 05:33.747
Clurman was the only victim
who didn't get hit at his door.

05:33.750 --> 05:34.785
Why?

05:35.250 --> 05:37.411
What was different about this one?

05:39.080 --> 05:42.072
Before Clurman passed out,
what he told cops at the time

05:42.080 --> 05:45.823
was that he saw the package sitting
on the stoop outside his kitchen door.

05:45.830 --> 05:47.570
Why didn't he take it in?

05:48.040 --> 05:50.281
Why didn't it go off
until he got to his car?

05:50.290 --> 05:51.917
It's like 50 feet away.

05:51.920 --> 05:54.912
Joe Reese, one of Clurman's investors,
was here before the bomb went off.

05:54.920 --> 05:56.410
Cops have ruled him out as a suspect,

05:56.420 --> 05:59.071
but he said he saw Clurman
get in the car with the package.

05:59.080 --> 06:01.708
So maybe Clurman
wasn't receiving a bomb at all.

06:01.710 --> 06:03.746
Maybe he was on his way
to delivering one.

06:03.750 --> 06:06.742
And he drops it or tilts it
and it goes off by accident.

06:06.750 --> 06:08.240
I'd like to talk to Clurman.

06:08.250 --> 06:11.538
In the meantime, let's get a warrant
to search his house.

06:14.250 --> 06:17.708
Okay, switches, switches...

06:23.960 --> 06:25.825
You have a package.

06:25.830 --> 06:29.459
Don't worry, it had a police escort
all the way from Palm Beach.

06:30.670 --> 06:33.707
Okay, right on time.
Thanks, man, I got this.

06:34.420 --> 06:35.956
These are my bomb fragments.

06:35.960 --> 06:38.576
We can start
putting this bad boy together.

06:39.540 --> 06:43.613
Why bother? Don't you just look
at the pieces for prints and stuff and...

06:44.750 --> 06:48.459
-Garcia, what are you doing in the FBI?
-I didn't get into medical school.

06:48.460 --> 06:52.373
-And why does that not surprise me?
-Ouch. That's what my father said.

06:52.920 --> 06:54.319
All right,
I'm about to teach you something.

06:54.330 --> 06:56.787
-So pay attention.
-It's like school.

06:56.790 --> 06:57.996
Look, how these things are put together

06:58.000 --> 06:59.285
can tell you how the UnSub thinks.

06:59.290 --> 07:02.168
-You sound like Gideon.
-Okay, ouch.

07:02.880 --> 07:05.451
You think it's bull? Okay.

07:06.830 --> 07:08.115
All right.

07:10.000 --> 07:11.877
-You see that section of pipe?
-Yeah.

07:11.880 --> 07:14.496
Okay. That right there
used to be part of the cap.

07:14.500 --> 07:16.616
It's screwed
onto these threads right here.

07:16.620 --> 07:20.169
But, see, here's the thing.
It had to be done very carefully.

07:20.170 --> 07:22.741
Because even if one tiny
grain of powder got onto those studs

07:22.750 --> 07:23.910
while he was working,

07:28.120 --> 07:29.917
See you later, UnSub.

07:29.920 --> 07:32.206
Now, he didn't have to
use a powder that fine.

07:32.210 --> 07:34.075
He didn't have to use threaded caps.

07:34.080 --> 07:35.456
And he didn't even
have to use a steel pipe,

07:35.460 --> 07:37.416
and it would have been
a whole lot safer if he hadn't,

07:37.420 --> 07:40.287
but the bomb wouldn't have been
nearly as deadly.

07:40.290 --> 07:42.417
So, what's that tell you
about our UnSub?

07:42.420 --> 07:43.455
He's one sick puppy?

07:44.920 --> 07:48.242
To say the least.
One sick puppy that aims to kill.

07:48.880 --> 07:52.247
Not scare, not vandalize or make
some kind of political statement.

07:52.250 --> 07:53.285
Kill.

07:58.920 --> 08:00.114
Upstairs is all clear.

08:00.120 --> 08:02.247
Where's your team right now?
-They're out in the garage.

08:02.250 --> 08:04.241
After they finish the garage,
make sure they check the attic.

08:04.250 --> 08:05.410
-Agent Hotchner

08:05.420 --> 08:07.991
Detective Morrison, Palm Beach P.D.
I'm lead on the case.

08:08.000 --> 08:09.615
Nice to meet you.
This is Agent Greenaway.

08:09.620 --> 08:11.167
Agents Reid and Gideon
are at the hospital,

08:11.170 --> 08:13.035
and I think you met Agent Jareau
at the station house.

08:13.040 --> 08:15.281
-Oh, yeah. She's taken over the place.
-She does that.

08:15.290 --> 08:17.281
ATF hasn_'t found
any hard evrdence yet,

08:17.290 --> 08:20.168
just some kitchen timers,
tape recorders and electrical switches.

08:20.170 --> 08:22.661
Yeah, it is amazing
how many household items

08:22.670 --> 08:25.161
_ count as _
potential bomb-making materials.

08:25.540 --> 08:26.700
Hello?

08:28.170 --> 08:30.320
-Excuse me?
-Mrs. Clurman.

08:30.330 --> 08:32.616
-Yeah.
-What's going on here?

08:32.620 --> 08:36.329
Mrs. Clurman, my name is Special
Agent Aaron Hotchner with the FBI.

08:36.330 --> 08:37.911
What are you doing in my house?

08:37.920 --> 08:40.571
There's a copy of the warrant
on the table.

08:40.580 --> 08:42.116
I know that this is hard to believe,

08:42.120 --> 08:43.997
but we just need to cover
all of our bases.

08:44.000 --> 08:46.912
We need to make sure that your
husband was not involved in any way.

08:46.920 --> 08:48.160
Involved?

08:48.170 --> 08:50.320
My husband's in the hospital
with his leg blown off.

08:50.330 --> 08:51.490
What are you talking about?

08:51.500 --> 08:53.957
Mrs. Clurman,
there are some questions

08:53.960 --> 08:55.746
that your husband needs to answer.

08:55.750 --> 08:58.207
And the sooner that we talk to him
and clear him,

08:58.210 --> 09:01.111
_then the sooner _
we can fInd whoever's responSIble.

09:01.790 --> 09:04.372
Agent Hotchner?
We've got something.

09:11.830 --> 09:14.572
We found this buried
on the back of that shelf.

09:18.040 --> 09:22.488
Mrs. Clurman, do you know
anything about this?

09:33.330 --> 09:36.072
Can you tell us
about the package, Mr. Clurman?

09:36.080 --> 09:38.036
I thought I knew what it was.

09:38.580 --> 09:41.162
A pot for an orchid. I collect them.

09:42.170 --> 09:44.377
I ordered the pot through the mail.

09:44.670 --> 09:47.742
-Why didn't you take it inside?
-It was for my office.

09:47.750 --> 09:50.913
I was going there anyway.
I thought I'd take it with me.

09:51.960 --> 09:54.110
That's the last thing I remember.

09:55.960 --> 09:58.747
You had an argument with Joe Reese.
Do you remember that?

09:58.750 --> 09:59.910
Joe was there?

09:59.920 --> 10:02.821
He was angry.
He accused you of blowing him off.

10:04.040 --> 10:07.112
-Any reason he'd want to hurt you No.

10:07.620 --> 10:10.111
I mean, he's a confrontational guy.

10:10.120 --> 10:13.453
If he wanted to kill me,
he'd just beat me to death.

10:16.040 --> 10:18.452
A lot of people were angry
about that deal falling apart,

10:18.460 --> 10:20.280
and they were angry at you.

10:21.920 --> 10:23.956
I don't know,
how does that make you feel?

10:23.960 --> 10:25.245
I felt awful.

10:26.790 --> 10:30.703
I thought those condos would make
a lot of money for a lot of people,

10:30.960 --> 10:32.416
myself included.

10:33.040 --> 10:37.454
I thought that geologist was legit.
He didn't even take samples.

10:38.460 --> 10:39.700
He scammed us.

10:40.420 --> 10:42.911
All those investors
who lost their money.

10:43.500 --> 10:44.740
But Barbara...

10:45.540 --> 10:47.781
The first victim.

10:47.790 --> 10:50.167
-Yeah.
-What about her?

10:50.170 --> 10:53.571
It's just such a shame.
Such a nice lady, you know?

10:54.250 --> 10:56.115
It was such an easy sale.

10:56.620 --> 10:57.951
Sometimes

10:59.000 --> 11:03.164
I felt like I took advantage of her
because she's old and lonely.

11:03.790 --> 11:05.200
Now she's dead.

11:06.830 --> 11:08.206
I feel terrible.

11:10.380 --> 11:12.780
-What is it?
-My foot.

11:15.330 --> 11:17.036
I'll get you some help.

11:31.500 --> 11:32.876
-Yeah?
-This isn't our guy.

11:32.880 --> 11:35.417
His answers were coherent
even while he was sedated.

11:35.420 --> 11:37.206
He's got a sense of humor,
displays empathy.

11:37.210 --> 11:39.201
Not to mention he has a hobby
unrelated to bomb-making.

11:39.210 --> 11:41.451
This is nothing
like a typical bomber profile.

11:41.460 --> 11:42.575
What about the materials we found?

11:42.580 --> 11:44.116
Well, we'll see if the fragments match

11:44.120 --> 11:45.917
at the bomb scene,
but I doubt they will.

11:45.920 --> 11:46.955
Okay.

11:47.670 --> 11:50.286
Look at this.
This is their nephew in Texas.

11:50.290 --> 11:51.917
And according to Mrs. Clurman,

11:51.920 --> 11:55.208
he was staying with them for a month
and left last week.

11:55.210 --> 11:58.452
Mercury switches are a little
sophisticated for a 12-year-old kid.

11:58.460 --> 12:02.328
I'm not saying he's the UnSub,
but boys his age like to blow stuff up.

12:03.330 --> 12:04.661
I'll call Morrison.

12:04.670 --> 12:08.663
He'll contact local PD. in Texas.
He'll pick up the kid and talk to him.

12:15.290 --> 12:18.168
You know, a watched bomb
never assembles.

12:20.580 --> 12:22.821
I'm down to the last few pieces,
and for the life of me,

12:22.830 --> 12:26.493
I can't figure out how they fit together
or if they ﬁt together.

12:28.250 --> 12:30.992
They might not even be
part of the bomb at all.

12:31.750 --> 12:35.208
What's the big deal? You got most of it.
I'd give you a B plus.

12:36.380 --> 12:37.415
Thanks.

12:38.420 --> 12:40.786
The big deal is it could be
part of a signature.

12:40.790 --> 12:43.031
Signature. Like a sign of the Zodiac,
that kind of thing?

12:43.040 --> 12:44.746
Yeah, yeah. Just like that.

12:44.750 --> 12:47.662
I was serious. _
I really wanted to learn that tIme.

12:52.830 --> 12:54.320
You know, like a flourish.

12:54.330 --> 12:56.616
You know, certain kind of pipe,
certain mix of powders.

12:56.620 --> 12:59.373
Like the Unabomber. He always used
something wooden in his bombs.

12:59.380 --> 13:00.665
I mean, I don't know.
I mean, these guys,

13:00.670 --> 13:03.878
they think they're artists or something,
so they sign their work.

13:03.880 --> 13:05.609
And you think by putting
these last pieces together

13:05.620 --> 13:07.576
you might find the signature?

13:07.880 --> 13:08.995
Yeah.

13:10.500 --> 13:13.207
See, sometimes
the design itself is unique.

13:13.210 --> 13:14.609
So once we do put it all together,

13:14.620 --> 13:17.032
we can compare it to other exemplars
in our evidence database

13:17.040 --> 13:18.701
and see if the bomb
was built by somebody

13:18.710 --> 13:19.995
we may have already come across.

13:20.000 --> 13:22.116
-What?
-If there was another piece like this...

13:22.120 --> 13:23.371
No, I tried it. It doesn't fit.

13:23.380 --> 13:24.916
No, it could have been
part of a longer rod

13:24.920 --> 13:28.037
that fit through the top
and went all the way through.

13:30.580 --> 13:31.820
Tetris.

13:34.040 --> 13:36.110
-Damn it.
-What

13:36.120 --> 13:37.610
No. No, no, Garcia.

13:38.500 --> 13:39.740
You nailed it.

13:40.960 --> 13:42.746
I know who built this bomb.

13:43.920 --> 13:46.320
The guy's doing life in federal prison.

13:57.920 --> 13:59.035
Morgan e-mailed these over.

13:59.040 --> 14:00.826
The three on the left
are the bombs from yesterday.

14:00.830 --> 14:02.957
The one on the right's from the
evidence room at Quantico.

14:02.960 --> 14:06.032
They're all identical.
Made with steel reinforcement rods.

14:06.040 --> 14:07.200
Adrian Bale.

14:08.960 --> 14:09.995
VVho?

14:10.670 --> 14:13.707
He held our agents in
a standoff in Boston last year.

14:13.710 --> 14:17.202
He took out six agents
and a hostage with one of his bombs.

14:17.580 --> 14:21.118
-So you're thinking he's behind this?
-Possibly.

14:21.120 --> 14:22.246
But he's in prison.

14:22.250 --> 14:25.117
He's got kind of a cult following,
like Charles Manson.

14:25.120 --> 14:26.326
It could just be a copycat.

14:26.330 --> 14:27.570
There's one way to find out.

14:27.580 --> 14:30.822
-Let's put the screws to this guy.
-No, no, no. Bale's too smart.

14:30.830 --> 14:34.664
If we want information from him,
we have to handle him carefully,

14:34.670 --> 14:37.036
and even then you have to assume
that road will lead nowhere.

14:37.040 --> 14:39.326
You're saying the connection to Bale
doesn't help us at all?

14:39.330 --> 14:41.616
No. I'm just saying let us handle Bale.

14:41.620 --> 14:43.747
Look, we just heard
from local Texas P.D.

14:43.750 --> 14:45.615
You were right
about Clurman's nephew.

14:45.620 --> 14:47.167
He admitted the bomb stuff was his,

14:47.170 --> 14:50.037
which is great for the Clurmans
but it leaves us with zero suspects.

14:50.040 --> 14:52.372
So what do you suggest
my men do now?

14:52.380 --> 14:54.109
Proceed from the profile.

14:54.380 --> 14:56.416
I didn't know we had a profile.

14:56.670 --> 14:57.955
When we're dealing with a bomber,

14:57.960 --> 15:01.202
we're talking about someone
who's non-confrontational.

15:01.210 --> 15:04.247
If you bumped into him in a caf,
he'd apologize.

15:05.080 --> 15:07.457
I'm so sorry! I didn't...

15:08.580 --> 15:10.491
Even if it wasn't his fault.

15:11.330 --> 15:13.787
We would classify this bomber
as highly organized

15:13.790 --> 15:16.327
based on the meticulous design
of his bombs.

15:16.330 --> 15:18.378
It means above-average intelligence.

15:18.380 --> 15:22.111
He probably has a skilled job, a trade.
One that allows him to work alone.

15:22.120 --> 15:24.202
That's how he was able
to make a sophisticated device

15:24.210 --> 15:25.916
without raising suspicion.

15:25.920 --> 15:28.070
Furniture maker, jeweler, et cetera.

15:28.080 --> 15:30.571
-Background in explosives?
-No, not necessarily.

15:30.580 --> 15:33.879
You're thinking about a type
who likes to blow things up.

15:34.920 --> 15:37.787
Gives them an emotional
or sexual release.

15:37.790 --> 15:39.371
Death, secondary.

15:39.380 --> 15:42.281
-Then what's this guy doing?
-Murdering.

15:42.790 --> 15:44.667
Bombs? Just weapons.

15:45.580 --> 15:49.869
And these attacks,
they are not random.

15:49.880 --> 15:51.324
Well, how do you know that?

15:51.330 --> 15:52.786
By process of elimination.

15:52.790 --> 15:53.996
We know bombers fall

15:54.000 --> 15:56.321
into a discrete number of categories
according to motive.

15:56.330 --> 15:58.537
There's the terrorist,
whose aim is to spread fear.

15:58.540 --> 16:01.782
We'd expect him to strike
in a populous area, like a subway.

16:01.790 --> 16:03.246
There's the politically
motivated bomber.

16:03.250 --> 16:05.457
He makes a statement
by choosmg a symbolic target,

16:05.460 --> 16:06.745
like an abortion clinic.

16:06.750 --> 16:07.990
Then there's our UnSub.

16:11.290 --> 16:14.032
specifically by
placing the bombs at their stoops.

16:14.040 --> 16:16.110
That tells us he has a direct motive.

16:16.120 --> 16:18.668
Statistically, he bombs for profit
or to conceal a crime.

16:18.670 --> 16:21.241
And it tells us
how we're going to find him.

16:21.250 --> 16:22.740
Through the people he killed.

16:22.750 --> 16:26.117
Somewhere among the three victims
there is a direct motive.

16:27.750 --> 16:30.116
Thanks.

16:30.120 --> 16:31.701
If you have any questions,
we'll be around.

16:31.710 --> 16:34.110
You'll be around. I'll be in prison.

16:34.120 --> 16:36.168
Somebody's got to talk to Bale.

16:39.290 --> 16:41.326
Detective Morrison

16:41.330 --> 16:43.571
We're combing through
all the investors in the land deal.

16:43.580 --> 16:45.161
Got a couple of suspects
who fit the profile.

16:45.170 --> 16:46.319
We're gonna talk to them.

16:46.330 --> 16:48.070
Okay. Well, if you need anything,
just let us know.

16:48.080 --> 16:49.115
Right.

16:52.670 --> 16:53.910
How we doing?

16:54.580 --> 16:55.820
Frustrated.

16:55.830 --> 16:58.708
I can't see why anyone
would want to kill a little old lady

16:58.710 --> 17:00.530
who collects cats and coins.

17:00.540 --> 17:02.246
Unless somebody wanted the coins.

17:02.250 --> 17:03.706
I spent a good chunk of my childhood

17:03.710 --> 17:06.201
looking for a 1944 penny
worth thousands.

17:07.380 --> 17:10.918
Yeah, so I was a little bit of a nerd.
Is that so surprising?

17:10.920 --> 17:12.035
Not to me.

17:15.420 --> 17:16.785
-Morgan?-Yeah.

17:16.790 --> 17:19.372
I just got the lab results from
the powder residues on the bombs.

17:19.380 --> 17:23.032
Ammonia nitrate, potassium chloride
and aluminum powder.

17:23.540 --> 17:24.916
Nobody uses that mixture, Hotch.

17:24.920 --> 17:26.740
-Nobody but Bale.-That's right.

17:26.750 --> 17:27.910
And the closer I look at these things,

17:27.920 --> 17:29.035
the more they're the same.

17:29.040 --> 17:31.372
Same weld patterns, same switch
assembly, same thread sizing.

17:31.380 --> 17:32.745
It's weird, man.

17:32.750 --> 17:34.741
This guy's not building bombs,
he's forging them.

17:34.750 --> 17:36.240
That's the other reason I'm calling you.

17:36.250 --> 17:39.822
Bale wrote addresses on his packages
in block letters with blue ink.

17:39.830 --> 17:41.240
I'm thinking our guy's doing the same.

17:41.250 --> 17:44.037
Okay. I'll set up a press conference,
make sure the public knows.

17:44.040 --> 17:45.416
Thanks, Morgan.

17:47.330 --> 17:48.456
Excuse me.

17:49.710 --> 17:50.825
Hotchner.

17:50.830 --> 17:51.956
Agent Halloway
F.B.I. Assistant Director

17:51.960 --> 17:54.667
Look, obviously Bale
burned us pretty bad.

17:54.670 --> 17:56.740
We just wanna make sure
if we're in a position

17:59.500 --> 18:00.740
Well, I think that's premature.

18:00.750 --> 18:02.286
_We're not even sure
If Bale's Involved yet.

18:02.290 --> 18:03.416
And what if he is?

18:03.420 --> 18:06.742
Are you sure you'd want to deal with
a guy who took out six of our agents?

18:08.000 --> 18:11.788
Half of Florida is in a panic.
There might not be another choice.

18:12.670 --> 18:14.285
Well, there has to be.

18:18.040 --> 18:20.827
U.S. Penitentiary
ATLANTA, GEORGIA

18:22.790 --> 18:25.532
Bale. You have a visitor.

18:26.620 --> 18:28.247
You know why I'm here?

18:30.580 --> 18:34.038
This guy in Palm Beach, right?
The Palm Beach Bomber.

18:34.580 --> 18:37.071
Somebody's got to
give him a better name.

18:38.670 --> 18:43.209
He uses your bombs, your designs.

18:44.580 --> 18:46.411
Well, he should be careful.

18:47.120 --> 18:48.951
Those things are dangerous.

18:50.290 --> 18:51.450
Adrian.

18:52.960 --> 18:54.416
You can't fool me.

18:56.330 --> 18:59.959
If you're involved in this in any way
and you do not help me,

19:00.670 --> 19:03.992
I will make your life even worse
than it is now.

19:04.000 --> 19:05.536
Oh, but no.

19:05.540 --> 19:10.079
Actually, I can fool you
because I fooled you before.

19:10.670 --> 19:13.912
And now there's another me out there.

19:14.540 --> 19:17.282
Watching. Waiting.

19:19.580 --> 19:22.071
We have new information
about the Palm Beach Bomber.

19:22.080 --> 19:25.038
In addition to placing the bombs
in plain brown packages,

19:25.040 --> 19:27.873
we have reason to believe
that the bomber

19:27.880 --> 19:31.532
may handwrite the delivery addresses
on a plain white label.

19:31.540 --> 19:33.610
Mommy, when's Daddy coming home?

19:34.170 --> 19:36.957
He's got to get the beach house
ready for the next renters.

19:36.960 --> 19:38.279
He'll be back tomorrow.

19:38.290 --> 19:39.416
...should be examined carefully.

19:39.420 --> 19:41.320
Especially if you don't recognize
the return address...

19:41.330 --> 19:42.706
Have you unpacked your suitcase yet?

19:42.710 --> 19:43.995
No. I'll go do it right now.

19:44.000 --> 19:47.993
With your help, we should be able
to prevent any further casualties.

19:48.000 --> 19:49.991
Thank you for your vigilance.

19:56.460 --> 19:59.247
You were more ruthless
than I expected.

19:59.250 --> 20:01.377
If you hadn't pushed that button,

20:01.380 --> 20:04.201
you might've had
a chance at parole someday.

20:04.210 --> 20:05.245
Yeah.

20:07.170 --> 20:09.991
You know,
I've thought a lot about that day,

20:10.000 --> 20:13.037
and there's one thing
I still can't understand.

20:14.250 --> 20:16.115
You trusted me. Why?

20:16.120 --> 20:18.827
-I never trusted you.
-You listened to me.

20:18.830 --> 20:20.377
I made an error.

20:20.380 --> 20:23.201
I calculated you wouldn't do it,
and you did.

20:23.210 --> 20:26.611
Whatever you think,
I'm going to walk out of here,

20:26.620 --> 20:28.110
and you never will.

20:28.880 --> 20:30.450
Here's what I think.

20:33.040 --> 20:36.749
Sending those agents into that
warehouse, it just doesn't make sense.

20:36.750 --> 20:38.286
I mean, I've read your books.

20:38.290 --> 20:41.032
I had all those things...
What did you call it?

20:41.420 --> 20:43.376
A homicidal triad.

20:44.380 --> 20:48.168
I even came from a broken family.
Classic sociopath.

20:48.170 --> 20:52.413
So when I had the chance to kill
six agents, plus a hostage...

20:52.920 --> 20:55.821
I mean, just because I gave myself up

20:55.830 --> 20:57.957
doesn't mean that I was finished
with those people.

20:57.960 --> 21:02.033
I still had the remote.
You... You should have known that.

21:05.790 --> 21:09.282
The emotional release
I would feel by pressing that button...

21:10.290 --> 21:14.704
Well, that was just a little too
overwhelming to pass up.

21:17.000 --> 21:20.208
Why didn't you search me
before sending those agents in?

21:21.170 --> 21:24.321
Why didn't you do your job,
Agent Gideon?

21:34.250 --> 21:37.117
-Mommy, there's a present for you.
-A present?

21:37.830 --> 21:41.379
-What does it look like?
-It's brown with blue letters.

21:41.380 --> 21:42.950
Can I bring it to you?

21:48.330 --> 21:50.787
No! No!

21:59.500 --> 22:01.115
Keep holding on, baby.

22:03.460 --> 22:05.610
The first thing we gotta do
is get the mother out of there.

22:05.620 --> 22:06.871
-Okay.
-Got it.

22:07.880 --> 22:09.609
Just keep holding on, okay?

22:09.620 --> 22:11.781
-But it's heavy.
-I know.

22:11.790 --> 22:13.667
I know, but you're doing
such a good job.

22:13.670 --> 22:14.989
Hey, everything is going to be okay.

22:15.000 --> 22:17.537
No, no. No body armor.
They don't want to scare the little girl.

22:17.540 --> 22:20.202
-Just a few more minutes.
-Hear that? We're almost there.

22:20.210 --> 22:22.246
-It's heaw. I can't hold it.
-I know. Yes, you can!

22:22.250 --> 22:23.615
You're gonna have to
step back, ma'am.

22:23.620 --> 22:25.781
Yes, you can.
I'm not leaving my daughter.

22:25.790 --> 22:29.032
Okay, you need to trust me. Okay.

22:29.960 --> 22:34.909
Okay now, sweetie. Don't move, okay?
Don't move, sweetie.

22:34.920 --> 22:37.491
-I'm going to come up and meet you.
-Such a good girl.

22:37.500 --> 22:39.707
Just a few more minutes.

22:39.710 --> 22:41.200
-I can't. I can't. It's heavy.
-Yes, you can.

22:41.210 --> 22:42.609
-You're doing great, sweetie.
-It's slipping.

22:42.620 --> 22:43.917
You're doing great. Hang on, hang on.

22:43.920 --> 22:47.412
There. Almost there. Almost there.

22:50.330 --> 22:52.241
-Come on.
-Okay, go! Go!

22:52.250 --> 22:54.070
-Come here, baby.
-This way.

22:55.250 --> 22:57.036
Right through here, ma'am.

22:59.460 --> 23:02.167
Bale may be part of this,
but he's not in control of it.

23:02.170 --> 23:04.536
If he were, he would have
taunted me with specifics.

23:04.540 --> 23:05.700
So what's our next move?

23:05.710 --> 23:08.201
I'll let Bale know
the UnSub's using his designs.

23:08.210 --> 23:09.666
-Bait.-Yeah, exactly.

23:09.670 --> 23:12.491
If Bale wasn't part of it before,
he'll sure want to be part of it now.

23:12.500 --> 23:15.071
I'm going to stay behind and monitor
his mail, calls, visitors,

23:15.080 --> 23:16.957
any contact that he has
with the outside world.

23:16.960 --> 23:18.700
Good. Even if he
doesn't know the UnSub,

23:18.710 --> 23:20.871
he may want to try to contact him.

23:21.500 --> 23:22.785
I might have something.

23:22.790 --> 23:25.748
Barbara Keller was having trouble
insuring some coins she'd bought.

23:25.750 --> 23:27.820
The insurance company thought
they might be fake.

23:27.830 --> 23:30.412
So the insurance company's
blowing up annoying clients?

23:30.420 --> 23:32.661
What if someone
sold her the fake coins?

23:32.670 --> 23:35.491
She's on to him. He shuts her up.

23:35.500 --> 23:37.536
Were these coins valuable enough
to kill over?

23:37.540 --> 23:41.169
She told the insurance company she
thought they might be worth $12,000.

23:41.170 --> 23:43.570
All right. Do you have any idea
who sold her the coins?

23:43.580 --> 23:48.415
No. But she had an appointment
with a coin dealer scheduled,

23:48.420 --> 23:51.912
I'm guessing to challenge
the insurance company's appraisal.

23:51.920 --> 23:53.114
A guy named David Walker.

23:53.120 --> 23:55.827
So, maybe he can help us figure out
who sold her the coins.

23:57.210 --> 24:00.077
Office of Supreme Genius Puzzle
Solver. Do you have a riddle for me?

24:00.080 --> 24:02.116
I found_ out Bale's been
accessmg the Internet

24:02.120 --> 24:05.419
by getting around a firewall that's
set up on a prison library computer.

24:05.420 --> 24:08.787
-The guy even has an e-mail address.
-Sneaky bastard.

24:08.790 --> 24:11.873
Yeah, he's headed to the library right
now, maybe to contact the UnSub.

24:11.880 --> 24:14.826
Now, is there a way to possibly monitor
his keystrokes while he's online?

24:14.830 --> 24:15.956
I can send him a virus,

24:15.960 --> 24:17.575
but he'll have to open the e-mail
for it to work.

24:17.580 --> 24:18.740
Let's do it.

24:18.750 --> 24:21.992
-What do you want in the subject line?-Let's think.

24:22.000 --> 24:24.571
-Something that'll make him open it.
-Yeah.

24:25.040 --> 24:27.611
He's impotent. Something that will
make him feel in control.

24:27.620 --> 24:29.030
I got something.

24:58.830 --> 24:59.956
We got this guy's number.

24:59.960 --> 25:02.281
He's visited six porn sites
in the past half hour.

25:02.290 --> 25:03.996
-Anything else?
-Hold on.

25:04.000 --> 25:05.911
He's posting to a message board.

25:05.920 --> 25:07.660
Naughtyhobbies.net.

25:07.670 --> 25:10.571
Looks like some sort of site
for bomb enthusiasts.

25:10.830 --> 25:15.278
"To all my friends out there, beware.
They are onto you."

25:15.290 --> 25:16.416
We need the names of everyone

25:16.420 --> 25:19.412
who's been on that message board
in the past month.

25:39.330 --> 25:41.207
186 e-mails.

25:41.210 --> 25:43.030
Through the ISP,
we were able to track down the names

25:43.040 --> 25:46.077
and some of the addresses,
but none of them are in Palm Beach.

25:46.080 --> 25:47.741
How about occupations?

25:47.750 --> 25:50.822
Wasn't a required field, so really
only about a third of them are filled in.

25:50.830 --> 25:53.572
Well, the UnSub takes pride
in his work. He would fill it in.

25:53.580 --> 25:55.536
You're right. Let's see.

25:55.540 --> 26:00.159
We have trucker, physician,
antiquities dealer,

26:01.040 --> 26:03.167
store owner, orderly...

26:03.170 --> 26:04.239
Wait.

26:05.210 --> 26:08.202
-Antiquities dealer What is it?

26:11.540 --> 26:16.375
Personally, I couldn't think of anything
more boring than coins and old papers.

26:16.380 --> 26:17.995
-Are you single?
-Yes.

26:18.000 --> 26:21.879
don't marry the first guy that proposes.

26:22.420 --> 26:24.206
I wanted a pool table back there,

26:24.210 --> 26:27.077
but David insisted
on making it his workshop.

26:27.460 --> 26:29.701
Hey, Reid. Okay, shoot.

26:31.540 --> 26:34.202
"David..."

26:37.830 --> 26:38.876
Elle.

26:39.460 --> 26:41.166
I gotta call you back.

26:41.170 --> 26:44.242
-What's he up to now?
-Well, it sounds like a car.

26:45.460 --> 26:48.497
I hope he's not committing suicide.
I won't be able to collect life insurance.

26:48.500 --> 26:50.070
-Yeah It's him!

26:50.080 --> 26:51.286
It's Walker!

26:52.080 --> 26:53.661
Get out of the way!

27:12.750 --> 27:13.910
You okay?

27:14.210 --> 27:18.169
-Yeah, I'm all right, but Mrs. Walker...
-Yeah, guy's a real peach.

27:19.080 --> 27:21.321
Morrison's got a countywide search
out for the car.

27:21.330 --> 27:23.662
Uniforms are going to try to find out
where his haunts are,

27:23.670 --> 27:25.820
and ATF should be here any minute.

27:26.750 --> 27:28.570
You sure you're all right?

27:29.170 --> 27:32.662
Mrs. Walker said her husband
spent most of his time in the garage.

27:32.670 --> 27:34.160
Let's check it out.

27:45.420 --> 27:48.378
-We got the organized part right.
-What's this?

27:50.580 --> 27:53.071
I've seen this. It's for electroplating.

27:54.790 --> 27:57.918
-Look at the date on the coin.
-It's half gone.

27:57.920 --> 27:59.660
He was using this to build up the metal

27:59.670 --> 28:01.240
so he could
change the dates on the coins.

28:01.250 --> 28:03.411
-To increase the value.
-Exactly.

28:03.420 --> 28:05.991
Like what he did
with Barbara Keller's coins.

28:06.000 --> 28:08.321
Look over here. Check this out.

28:14.830 --> 28:15.990
"The best."

28:16.500 --> 28:19.162
So this is why
he chose to use Bale's design.

28:20.000 --> 28:22.491
He was working on something.

28:29.210 --> 28:32.611
Make sure Morrison tells your officers
that this guy is smart, dangerous,

28:32.620 --> 28:35.111
and he has absolutely nothing to lose.

28:49.620 --> 28:52.248
-You ready to do some work

28:52.250 --> 28:55.071
I haven't slept this week.
I might as well give up eating, too.

28:55.080 --> 28:56.616
Poor baby.

28:56.620 --> 28:59.498
Try not to let the tears hit the paper.
It gets a little messy.

28:59.500 --> 29:00.615
What are they?

29:00.620 --> 29:02.201
These are e-mails from Bale's account.

29:02.210 --> 29:04.917
-Reid forwarded them to me.
-What are we looking for?

29:04.920 --> 29:06.569
Well, right now,
this guy Walker's in the wind.

29:06.580 --> 29:08.070
So we gotta look at him
from every angle,

29:08.080 --> 29:09.616
see if we can figure out his next move.

29:09.620 --> 29:10.826
Signature behavior.

29:10.830 --> 29:12.570
If Walker got bomb-making tips
from Bale,

29:12.580 --> 29:14.616
then maybe he got tips on
staying clear of the cops.

29:14.620 --> 29:16.872
Somebody's been taking notes.

29:16.880 --> 29:18.950
Medical school, shmedical school.

29:18.960 --> 29:22.782
Well, don't hurt yourself, Garcia.
Now find me something.

29:28.380 --> 29:30.416
So far nothing from the search.

29:31.580 --> 29:33.571
What do we know about Walker?

29:34.120 --> 29:35.951
He's a quiet career criminal.

29:35.960 --> 29:38.497
Spent four years in prison
for a series of forged cheques

29:38.500 --> 29:41.537
when he was in his early 205.
He's now 46.

29:41.540 --> 29:42.666
For the past 18 years,

29:42.670 --> 29:46.117
he owned a store which sold coins,
maps and historical documents.

29:46.120 --> 29:49.283
We raided the place as soon as
you gave us Walker's name.

29:49.290 --> 29:52.282
Most of his inventory was fake.
Forgeries valued in the millions.

29:52.290 --> 29:53.951
But the walls
had started to close in on him.

29:53.960 --> 29:56.611
We talked to some of his clients,
and he was in debt up to his ears

29:56.620 --> 29:58.576
and promising stuff
he didn't have time to forge.

29:58.580 --> 30:02.289
Then Barbara Keller found out that
the coins he had sold her were fake.

30:02.290 --> 30:03.416
She threatened to out him.

30:03.420 --> 30:05.661
And if she had, all of the forgeries
would've been discovered.

30:05.670 --> 30:08.878
-He would have done 20 years.
-So he had to shut her up?

30:09.670 --> 30:12.161
He planted all those bombs
just to kill one little old lady?

30:12.170 --> 30:15.162
And to throw us off, he made it look
like it was much bigger than it was.

30:15.170 --> 30:17.115
You hear me?
I said stop now!

30:17.750 --> 30:21.959
-Please. Help me.
-Everyone, back! Now!

30:21.960 --> 30:23.530
We need bomb squad in here!

30:23.540 --> 30:26.077
Please. It's not me.

30:26.080 --> 30:27.240
Don't come any closer.

30:27.250 --> 30:29.741
Put your hands up
and walk slowly back out.

30:29.750 --> 30:33.117
-I can't. He'll kill me.
-Who will?

30:33.120 --> 30:34.326
I don't know.

30:34.790 --> 30:38.282
He held a gun to me, put this on me.

30:38.290 --> 30:41.498
He said you'll know who he is.

30:42.040 --> 30:46.409
-Well, what does he want?
-A helicopter, a passport.

30:47.250 --> 30:48.456
He's watching.

30:49.580 --> 30:53.368
Once he gets what he wants he's got
instructions to defuse the bomb.

30:54.670 --> 30:57.662
-Walker's close by.
-Let's get snipers around the perimeter.

30:57.670 --> 30:58.989
Let's get snipers on the roof.

30:59.000 --> 31:01.207
Hey, we understand,
and we're not going to leave you.

31:01.210 --> 31:03.747
Please. Take it off.

31:04.830 --> 31:08.322
Well, we need to figure out
how the bomb's put together first.

31:08.330 --> 31:09.740
Tracy, you're in.

31:17.170 --> 31:19.912
This is a really sophisticated device.

31:19.920 --> 31:22.787
It looks like it was probably made
by a master bomb maker,

31:22.790 --> 31:26.169
which means tampering
with any part of it could set it off.

31:26.420 --> 31:29.207
So there's no way to just
cut the whole thing off of him?

31:29.210 --> 31:31.280
Well, not without cutting these wires.

31:31.290 --> 31:33.326
See how they're threaded
all around the collar?

31:33.330 --> 31:34.536
They could be booby-trapped,

31:34.540 --> 31:36.576
or there could be
a hidden secondary trigger.

31:36.580 --> 31:37.706
How do we find out?

31:37.710 --> 31:40.782
Without knowing how this thing is put
together, it's going to take a while.

31:40.790 --> 31:43.497
I'll have to x-ray it, try to figure out
which are the real triggers.

31:43.500 --> 31:45.320
But I don't think there's enough time.

31:45.330 --> 31:48.163
-What do you mean?
-There's a timer.

31:49.120 --> 31:51.497
We've only got about three hours left.

31:57.830 --> 31:58.990
What is it?

32:00.000 --> 32:02.787
-We need to go outside.
-No.

32:02.790 --> 32:05.111
He said he would kill me
if I went back out.

32:05.120 --> 32:06.496
He made sure I told you that.

32:06.500 --> 32:08.661
-Then we need to isolate you.
-Why?

32:11.000 --> 32:14.163
There's nothing you can do

32:25.670 --> 32:28.457
Red alert!-Let's go! Move out! Move out!

32:44.000 --> 32:45.160
I don't get it.

32:45.170 --> 32:49.379
If this guy's a hostage, then why hasn't
Walker tried to negotiate with us?

32:50.670 --> 32:54.379
Maybe he's scared, or maybe he hasn't
figured out what his next move is yet.

32:55.290 --> 32:56.609
We have a bead on Walker.

32:56.620 --> 32:58.497
A sniper spotted him in his scope.

32:58.500 --> 33:00.377
He's sitting in an office building
across the street.

33:00.380 --> 33:03.201
It looks like a storage room
with a small window facing us.

33:03.210 --> 33:05.701
-We could surprise him.
-That's a good idea.

33:05.710 --> 33:07.746
If he feels cornered,
he might give himself up.

33:09.040 --> 33:10.780
Because bombers
are generally cowards.

33:10.790 --> 33:13.668
I'll take a team in, and we'll go in
through the back of the building.

33:13.670 --> 33:15.319
This feels wrong to me.

33:15.330 --> 33:17.491
Why would Walker let himself
be found so easily?

33:17.500 --> 33:18.660
-He wants to be found.
-Why?

33:18.670 --> 33:19.819
-To negotiate.
-Yeah, but then we lose

33:19.830 --> 33:20.990
the element of surprise.

33:21.000 --> 33:22.376
Well, hopefully we catch him off-guard,

33:22.380 --> 33:23.608
and he gives himself up immediately.

33:23.620 --> 33:26.498
If not, we take a hard line and make
him feel like he's got no way out.

33:26.500 --> 33:27.819
Remember, we have to take him alive.

33:27.830 --> 33:30.537
Walker's the only
who can defuse the necklace bomb.

33:30.540 --> 33:32.496
-Everybody ready?
-Yes, sir. Let's do it.

33:32.500 --> 33:33.990
Be careful.

33:34.000 --> 33:35.536
At the very least
we know he's got a gun.

33:35.540 --> 33:36.666
Copy that.

33:44.210 --> 33:46.246
We're approaching the door now.

33:47.710 --> 33:49.075
Copy that.

33:50.290 --> 33:52.246
So, bombers are cowards, huh?

33:52.750 --> 33:55.036
Yeah, every last one of them.

34:30.620 --> 34:32.576
David Walker? Federal agents.

34:34.750 --> 34:35.990
Federal agents!

34:44.830 --> 34:48.072
-Walker, freeze!
-Okay. Please. Don't shoot.

34:48.540 --> 34:50.531
Show yourself. Show yourself!

34:52.000 --> 34:54.241
-I'|| shoot up the whole room.
-Okay.

34:54.960 --> 34:57.372
All right. Now, put your hands
where I can see them.

34:57.380 --> 34:59.166
-I can't do that.
-Then I'll shoot.

34:59.170 --> 35:02.207
My hand's on the remote.
I told you what I want.

35:02.750 --> 35:06.459
The passport, the helicopter, the flight.

35:06.460 --> 35:07.609
Walker, listen to me.

35:07.620 --> 35:09.668
You're at the top
of the FBI's Most Wanted list.

35:09.670 --> 35:12.878
I think you're smart enough to realize
there's no way we're letting you go.

35:12.880 --> 35:15.952
But here's my counter-offer,
a chance to get out of here alive.

35:15.960 --> 35:18.201
All you have to do is give yourself up.

35:18.210 --> 35:21.611
Just slide the gun across the floor.
You have until three. One.

35:21.620 --> 35:23.030
You wouldn't let the hostage die.

35:23.040 --> 35:25.952
You_want to find out?
Don't gIve yourself up. Two.

35:26.290 --> 35:28.531
Okay. Okay.

35:33.170 --> 35:35.115
I'm coming out. Don't shoot.

35:38.040 --> 35:39.951
-Yeah.-Gideon, it's me.

35:39.960 --> 35:42.576
Ijust found an e-mail
Bale sent Walker two days ago.

35:42.580 --> 35:43.911
Listen to this.

35:43.920 --> 35:46.457
"My only regret is giving myself up,
and for what?

35:46.460 --> 35:48.200
"To be stuck in a cage
the rest of my life.

35:48.210 --> 35:49.416
"Don't make my mistake.

35:49.420 --> 35:52.912
"If they catch you, whatever you do,
don't let them keep you."

35:52.920 --> 35:54.820
Now walk slowly towards me.

35:57.330 --> 35:59.321
Let me see your hands, Walker.

36:07.880 --> 36:11.202
Walker's not a bomber. He's a forger.

36:12.000 --> 36:13.786
Get out of there now! Now!

36:13.790 --> 36:16.873
Go, go! Everybody, out!
G0, 90, 90, 90, 90!

36:31.120 --> 36:33.031
We're fine.
Everybody made it out.

36:33.040 --> 36:34.371
Everybody but Walker.

36:34.380 --> 36:36.996
-Is the hostage okay?-He's fine. For now.

36:37.620 --> 36:40.532
-How much time do we have?
-Two hours, 24 minutes.

36:42.040 --> 36:44.531
With Walker dead,
I'm all out of options.

36:50.210 --> 36:51.450
I've got one.

36:51.790 --> 36:52.825
Bale.

36:58.120 --> 36:59.576
We'll start with a transfer.

36:59.580 --> 37:03.414
You're in a high-security facility now.
We can get you medium.

37:03.420 --> 37:07.379
No. I want out of prison.
A mental facility.

37:07.380 --> 37:09.575
You're asking for something
we wouldn't give a bank robber.

37:09.580 --> 37:10.911
There are minimum-security facilities...

37:10.920 --> 37:12.160
I don't care.

37:13.790 --> 37:16.827
I want to be able to talk to people
who aren't prisoners.

37:16.830 --> 37:22.200
I want to _have access
to people, thIngs, the world.

37:23.710 --> 37:25.416
I want to connect again.

37:29.880 --> 37:30.949
All right.

37:32.790 --> 37:36.374
One more thing,
without which there is no deal.

37:36.830 --> 37:37.990
What is it?

37:38.580 --> 37:40.286
I want you to confess.

37:41.710 --> 37:44.167
I want you to admit
that I beat you in Boston,

37:44.170 --> 37:45.785
that I outsmarted you.

37:46.830 --> 37:52.496
I want you to apologize to the families
of those six victims you got killed.

37:53.040 --> 37:55.031
And I want it all in writing.

37:55.290 --> 37:57.167
Jason, that's enough.

38:00.210 --> 38:02.997
If I do this,
you'll tell me how to defuse the bomb?

38:03.000 --> 38:05.537
Only if you do this.

38:06.750 --> 38:10.242
-How do I know you won't lie to me?
-It's all in writing, Agent Gideon.

38:10.250 --> 38:12.241
If my client
refuses to give you the information,

38:12.250 --> 38:14.320
or if he gives you information
he knows to be untruthful,

38:14.330 --> 38:15.740
the deal is void.

38:25.710 --> 38:27.109
I wanna hear it.

38:31.830 --> 38:34.412
-There was a hostage situation, and...
-No.

38:35.120 --> 38:37.418
Don't read it. Say it.

38:43.750 --> 38:45.957
There was a hostage situation.

38:47.210 --> 38:49.030
I negotiated with Bale.

38:50.790 --> 38:52.746
He agreed to give himself up.

38:53.880 --> 38:56.667
He came out
of the warehouse peacefully.

38:58.000 --> 39:01.322
I gave the okay
to send six of my agents in and,

39:03.210 --> 39:05.030
and they never came out.

39:07.040 --> 39:08.450
It was a mistake.

39:10.580 --> 39:12.377
It was my mistake. I was...

39:14.380 --> 39:16.746
I was outfoxed by Mr. Bale.

39:20.000 --> 39:21.035
By you.

39:23.540 --> 39:25.747
I sincerely regret
having made the decision

39:25.750 --> 39:27.911
to send those agents in that day.

39:29.380 --> 39:33.168
And I sincerely regret and apologize

39:34.290 --> 39:37.111
to the families
of all those who died that day.

39:39.880 --> 39:41.279
Four more minutes.

39:46.880 --> 39:48.029
Okay.

39:48.040 --> 39:50.998
I've isolated the wires
connected to the actual device.

39:51.000 --> 39:54.959
We've got one shot at this.
It's either the blue wire or the red wire.

39:59.460 --> 40:02.827
Which do we cut, Bale

40:04.830 --> 40:05.876
Red.

40:06.830 --> 40:09.993
You know if you're lying and this thing
goes boom, you get nothing, right?

40:10.000 --> 40:11.069
Yes.

40:11.790 --> 40:13.746
If we cut the red, it's over?

40:16.540 --> 40:18.917
You get to spend your time
in a cushy asylum,

40:18.920 --> 40:24.324
bushes, trees, visits, nurses,
and we get this man out of here alive.

40:24.330 --> 40:26.662
I don't see how I could be any clearer.

40:26.670 --> 40:28.114
Seventeen seconds.

40:28.420 --> 40:30.741
-Red wire, right?
-Yes.

40:32.250 --> 40:33.660
Cut the blue.

40:34.080 --> 40:36.537
Are you sure?
-Do it.

40:42.210 --> 40:45.498
All right. Shouldn't take long
to cut this thing off now.

40:51.080 --> 40:53.457
Thank you. Thank you.

40:54.830 --> 40:56.070
How'd you know?

40:56.080 --> 40:59.743
And the emotional release
I would feel by pressmg that button...

41:00.880 --> 41:05.453
Well, that was just a little too
overwhelming to pass up.

41:06.210 --> 41:07.450
He told me.

41:09.000 --> 41:13.039
He said given the opportunity to press
that button, he'd have no choice.

41:14.080 --> 41:16.287
All I did was take his word for it.

41:29.670 --> 41:32.992
Despite the fact you lied to us
and your deal is void,

41:33.000 --> 41:34.615
I made sure to tell all your friends here

41:34.620 --> 41:38.954
how extremely willing you were to give
up information on your fellow inmates.

41:40.120 --> 41:41.951
You're a rare bird, Adrian.

41:42.830 --> 41:44.457
I can't tell you how much pleasure I get

41:44.460 --> 41:47.281
just knowing
I put you in this little tiny cage.

41:47.620 --> 41:50.612
You might even call it
an emotional release.
