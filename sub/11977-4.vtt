Come join me when you
get your legs under you.

00:11.111 --> 00:12.778
AJ?

00:12.780 --> 00:14.680
Your passport and the other
stuff AJ put together for you.

00:14.682 --> 00:15.514
Ethan: Listen, Roberts...

00:15.516 --> 00:17.383
No!

00:17.385 --> 00:19.118
CC: <i>Some drunk</i>
<i>black chick Talia.</i>

00:19.120 --> 00:21.353
She's all pissed off
'cause Stein closed her salon.

00:21.355 --> 00:24.056
She's saying I know enough about his
business to ruin his white ass.

00:24.058 --> 00:25.524

00:25.526 --> 00:26.625
Man: <i>Latrell capped D,</i>

00:26.627 --> 00:27.826
But you gonna take care of him.

00:27.828 --> 00:28.961
Cups: Want me
to bring Lobo along?

00:28.963 --> 00:30.496
Yeah, you go and do that,

00:30.498 --> 00:32.164
and when you're done, you
gonna take care of him, too.

00:32.165 --> 00:34.633
<i>Your brother's been talking,</i>
<i>the nigger is a snitch.</i>

00:34.635 --> 00:36.835
- Who shot the judge's kid?
- I'm workin' on it.

00:36.837 --> 00:38.871
- Yo, Latrell!
Woman: - Gun!

00:41.207 --> 00:42.307
I love you.

00:42.309 --> 00:43.208
(Grunts)

00:44.911 --> 00:47.880
- This is not your fault.
- Yeah, I know.

00:47.882 --> 00:50.749
You don't want to make those motherfuckers pay?
They're the common enemy.

00:50.751 --> 00:52.985
<i>You could be an ally.</i>
<i>We could figure this out.</i>

00:52.987 --> 00:53.986
Just in the neighborhood,
again, right?

00:53.988 --> 00:57.489
Get the fuck gone now, Ethan.

I'm right here, man.
Look at me.

02:25.812 --> 02:27.412
Now you need
to speak the fuck up,

02:27.414 --> 02:28.847
because ain't nobody else
gonna do it for you.

02:29.916 --> 02:30.716
I don't know
what this is about.

02:31.518 --> 02:34.019
(Scoffs)
Right.

02:34.021 --> 02:36.922
I guess we just ridin' around all AM
lookin' for chilly-lookin' motherfuckers.

02:36.924 --> 02:40.025
- Right, Jay?
- Gotta stay warm in this weather.

02:40.027 --> 02:41.860
Look, I think there's been
some kind of mistake.

02:41.862 --> 02:44.363
Ain't no fuckin' mistake, man.
You haven't been rolling around,

02:44.365 --> 02:46.165
- fuckin' followin' people in the city?
- No.

02:46.167 --> 02:48.433
- Harassing motherfuckers?
- Just out getting a coffee.

02:48.435 --> 02:49.968
- Getting a coffee.
- Yeah.

02:49.970 --> 02:51.303
Jay, crip this
lyin' motherfucker!

02:51.305 --> 02:52.871
- (Gun cocking)
Ethan: - Whoa, whoa, whoa.

02:52.873 --> 02:54.673
- What you doing, man? Just...
- Whoa, what, motherfucker?

02:54.675 --> 02:56.875
- ...put the gun away. - Don't fuckin'
tell me to put the fuckin' gun away!

03:02.115 --> 03:04.349
Now, look here, one more time
I'm gonna ask you this...

03:04.351 --> 03:06.329
Why you followin' Talia?

03:07.620 --> 03:09.288
- Look, I'm a private investigator.
- A private investigator?

03:09.290 --> 03:11.223
- Yeah, that's right.
- That's bullshit, man!

03:11.225 --> 03:13.192
- Listen...
- You said you was out gettin' coffee.

03:13.194 --> 03:17.024
I'm a private investigator for Marty Stein.
In-house. I'm working a divorce case.

03:18.131 --> 03:22.364
- Look, here...
- Slow your hands down.

03:24.404 --> 03:29.341
A client hired us to look
into her husband, Leo Taylor.

03:29.343 --> 03:32.211

have been hanging out lately.

03:33.646 --> 03:37.263
(Scoffs)
All right.

03:37.850 --> 03:39.885
We gonna see about this shit.

03:45.191 --> 03:47.025
Yo.

Ethan Kelly.

03:53.166 --> 03:54.166
Yeah.

03:56.936 --> 03:58.103
All right.

04:03.676 --> 04:04.910
Drive.

04:17.357 --> 04:18.457
(Sirens wailing)

04:23.196 --> 04:25.197
- Travis turn up?
- No, not quite.

04:27.066 --> 04:30.292
No. I'm going to sleep.
Call me when she comes.

04:35.308 --> 04:38.310
(Hip-hop music playing
over car stereo)

04:45.485 --> 04:46.952
You're a lucky motherfucker.

04:57.664 --> 04:58.864
(Door closes)

05:10.109 --> 05:12.678
Never ate breakfast as a kid.

05:12.680 --> 05:16.014
Wanted to go to school on an empty stomach.
Nerves, I guess.

05:16.016 --> 05:19.351
- You eat?
- No. I'm not hungry.

05:19.353 --> 05:22.387
- I can imagine. Sit.
- Right.

05:29.429 --> 05:31.530
I suppose I should thank you
for getting me out of that.

05:34.167 --> 05:37.169
You're in a lot of shit. So, why
don't you hold off on the gratitude

05:38.538 --> 05:40.238
until you tell me
what the fuck is goin' on?

05:42.542 --> 05:44.509
Well, I haven't been
completely honest with you.

05:46.446 --> 05:49.147
Look, I followed a lead
that CC gave me

05:49.149 --> 05:51.617
about a woman that was
talking about you. That's it.

05:51.951 --> 05:53.285
Lot of women talk about me.

05:53.287 --> 05:54.853
Well, this one wasn't
saying very nice things.

05:54.855 --> 05:57.622
Such as?

05:57.624 --> 06:00.826
Something about her salon, and that
she knew enough about your business

06:00.828 --> 06:02.561
to ruin your white ass,
whatever that means.

06:04.297 --> 06:07.332
And you asked CC
to hide this from me?

06:07.334 --> 06:11.236
No, no, no. My mistake is that I should
have come to you. I should have told you.

06:11.238 --> 06:12.971
Do I look like I give a shit
what you should have done?

06:15.575 --> 06:17.676
- You're hiding something from me...
- No, sir...

06:17.678 --> 06:19.544
- I can smell it on you.
- (Chuckling)

06:19.546 --> 06:22.533
- I have no interest in that...
- All I wanted to do is check...

06:32.492 --> 06:34.526
General Howard's building
a case against you.

06:34.528 --> 06:36.498
- (Clears throat)
- What?

06:37.997 --> 06:39.331
He seems pretty motivated, too.

06:39.333 --> 06:41.547
He sent me across the country
to do it.

06:42.835 --> 06:45.237
You know, you could have named
about a thousand other names

06:45.239 --> 06:46.705
and I might have believed you.

06:46.707 --> 06:48.507
There's no way in a million
years I'd believe that one.

06:48.509 --> 06:50.075
Well, good,
I'm sure he's countin' on it.

06:53.112 --> 06:55.514
You know what?
(Clears throat)

06:55.516 --> 06:58.183
You can believe me
or don't believe me.

06:58.185 --> 07:00.452
I don't really give a fuck,
to be honest.

07:00.454 --> 07:02.788
But the one thing
that I know for sure,

07:02.790 --> 07:05.857
is that it took a lot to get me
here and even more to keep me.

07:05.859 --> 07:08.226
In my experience, Marty,

07:08.228 --> 07:10.961
a man doesn't go through that kind of
trouble without proper motivation.

07:13.099 --> 07:14.099
We're done.

07:15.535 --> 07:17.702
All right.

07:17.704 --> 07:20.172
You change your mind,
you know where to find me.

07:34.220 --> 07:36.455
- (Door closes)
- (Keypad beeping)

07:37.924 --> 07:40.459
(Cell phone ringing)

07:41.794 --> 07:43.295
Hello?

07:43.297 --> 07:44.796
- You still in town?
Grace: <i>- Yeah.</i>

07:44.798 --> 07:46.965
I got an idea, come pick me up.

07:46.967 --> 07:49.901
- Where are you?
<i>- Go to 33rd and Rochester.</i>

07:49.903 --> 07:52.070
- Pull in the car wash.
- Got it.

07:52.072 --> 07:53.405
- (Keypad beeping)
- (Tires screeching)

08:14.160 --> 08:15.227
So, what do you think, huh?

08:24.871 --> 08:26.705
I think today's a full-bagger.

08:30.276 --> 08:31.610
You can only do so much.

08:35.181 --> 08:38.015
We form relationships with these
kids that we never expect.

08:38.018 --> 08:39.784
And then we expect them
to pick up a gun

08:39.785 --> 08:41.586
and shoot into a crowd
coming out of church?

08:43.789 --> 08:46.324
I know what it sounds like.

08:46.326 --> 08:49.461
Maybe he was a
not-so-terribly-good human being.

08:49.463 --> 08:52.397
He was my not-so-terribly-good
human being.

08:54.800 --> 08:56.101
I'm sorry.

08:57.970 --> 08:59.204
You can't blame yourself.

09:03.309 --> 09:07.646
I know this is terrible timing.
I'm sorry, but...

09:07.648 --> 09:10.515
You know how my sister is, and she
keeps asking about brunch on the 5th.

09:10.517 --> 09:12.484
Oh, right.

09:12.486 --> 09:15.826
Um, am I invited to that?

09:17.323 --> 09:19.824
You are. You know you are. Don't
play dumb with me, Deakins.

09:19.826 --> 09:22.394
- I'm not playing dumb. I'm really
this stupid. - You better be.

09:24.564 --> 09:27.766
It's just that, with everything
going on at work right now...

09:27.768 --> 09:28.800
Okay, you know what?

09:30.536 --> 09:35.707
If you abandon me on this,
you know what I'm gonna do?

09:35.709 --> 09:39.589
I'm gonna take this spoon
and I'm going to pick

09:40.179 --> 09:43.682
every last fuckin'...

09:43.684 --> 09:45.216
- You don't have the balls.
- ...chocolate chip out.

09:45.218 --> 09:47.085
- Don't think I have the balls?
- Get your chip-picking spoon

09:47.087 --> 09:51.356
- out of my pancakes, you shithead.
- How do you fuckin' do that?

09:51.358 --> 09:53.725
All right, fine, I'll go. But
it's my playlist, there and back.

09:53.727 --> 09:55.527
Okay, fine.

09:57.530 --> 10:00.031
And I wanna see you
wearing a dress.

10:00.033 --> 10:02.617
All right, I'll go pick one
out of your closet.

10:07.206 --> 10:08.506
(Groaning)

10:17.617 --> 10:20.218
And what was so pressing
as to cause you to ignore

10:20.220 --> 10:22.587
repeated communications from
your confidential informant?

10:22.589 --> 10:24.923
I believe Agent Finnegan
was late-setup

10:24.925 --> 10:28.426
on a very interesting anecdote
about a rabbi, a priest

10:28.428 --> 10:32.564
and a Canadian who were all
suffering from severe flatulence.

10:32.566 --> 10:35.266
- Is that right? I'm telling
that right, right? - Yeah.

10:35.268 --> 10:37.469
- (Clears throat)
- I'm glad we all find

10:37.471 --> 10:41.006
Agent Deakins' incompetence
so endearing.

10:41.008 --> 10:44.776
But a federal informant
is dead, likely murdered,

10:44.778 --> 10:48.680
and Cups Harris has his boys running all
over you like this is the Wild West.

10:48.682 --> 10:53.078
I'm glad you're here, Angela, keeping us all
informed on how serious the situation is.

10:54.086 --> 10:55.220
Nate.

10:59.992 --> 11:02.994
Think she sucks her coffee up
directly through her asshole?

11:02.996 --> 11:03.919
Where are we at?

11:03.920 --> 11:06.820
Ramirez is running some teams
down on high-pri targets.

11:06.867 --> 11:09.200
- Squeeze 'em till they're blue.
- Same old.

11:09.202 --> 11:11.603
- Judge weigh in?
- He hasn't heard it from me yet.

11:11.605 --> 11:14.939
- I doubt he gives a shit, either way.
- Poor son of a bitch.

11:14.941 --> 11:18.309
- Where do you want us now?
- First bus came in.

11:18.311 --> 11:21.340
You show Cups and his dumb fuckers what
happens when they don't hold up their end.

11:24.784 --> 11:26.584
(Indistinct chattering)

11:31.624 --> 11:32.634
I don't know. I don't get it.

11:32.635 --> 11:34.715
What's not to get?
They fuck up, we fuck them up.

11:34.728 --> 11:36.995
You know, Cups came to us, then he reneges.
Does that seem right to you?

11:36.997 --> 11:39.464
You give these guys
too much credit.

11:39.466 --> 11:41.666
Cups knows we gotta come back at him.
What's the play?

11:41.668 --> 11:43.868
Cups doesn't have a play,
that's the play.

11:43.870 --> 11:46.638
You heard Guthrie, it's the
Wild Wild West out there.

11:46.640 --> 11:49.641
- Yeah, sure...
- They're not thinkers like us, Deak.

11:49.643 --> 11:51.209
Come on, I'll let you break
the first nose.

11:52.311 --> 11:53.839
You start with Akili.

11:56.415 --> 11:58.349
- (Door opens)
- Yo, Deak?

11:58.351 --> 12:01.052
- Yeah?
- You ever sit courtside before?

12:01.054 --> 12:03.354
- No.
- Why not?

12:03.356 --> 12:06.591
- Can't afford it.
- Well, shit. That's a damn fucking shame.

12:06.593 --> 12:09.994
Well, here. Young Akili
here is gonna treat us.

12:09.996 --> 12:13.431
That's awful charitable of him. Maybe we
can work out some kinda payment plan.

12:13.433 --> 12:16.167
Yo, Akili, how much do, like, two
courtside tickets go for these days?

12:16.169 --> 12:18.369
- Like three, four hundo?
- No, more like five, six.

12:18.371 --> 12:22.540
No, shit? So, you're tellin' me
this pile here is 50, 60 large?

12:22.542 --> 12:25.176
- That can't be right, can it?
- Math checks out.

12:25.178 --> 12:27.545
But I don't know if these'll
actually get us through the gate.

12:27.547 --> 12:29.547
Patrick: - Why you say that?
- It's just a hunch.

12:29.549 --> 12:31.339
Well, that'd be bad news
for young Akili here.

12:31.340 --> 12:32.610
It's devastating.

12:32.619 --> 12:35.954
- Fifty thousand in counterfeit tickets.
- That's a Class Two felony.

12:35.956 --> 12:38.189
That'd carry
seven years on that.

12:38.191 --> 12:41.126
We're not much interested in the retail
side of things, though, are we, Patty?

12:41.128 --> 12:43.218
No. I got a nose
for the manufacturing myself.

12:43.219 --> 12:44.825
What do you say, Akili?

12:45.799 --> 12:47.866
You point us to the press
these are coming off of,

12:47.868 --> 12:49.601
maybe we can take
a few off your hands.

12:53.639 --> 12:56.407
Akili: There's a place called Mezzo
Printing on Lower Clinton Street.

12:56.409 --> 12:57.942
They make these tickets
out back.

13:05.084 --> 13:07.719
(Exhales)

13:07.721 --> 13:10.088
Damn, no wonder everyone
is so angry in this city.

13:10.090 --> 13:11.589
- (Cell phone buzzing)
- It's too cold to be happy.

13:11.591 --> 13:13.591
Yeah, you were such a delight
in California.

13:13.593 --> 13:14.726
- (Beeping)
- Shit!

13:14.728 --> 13:15.894
Why are we just sitting here?

13:15.896 --> 13:18.062
Because I'm the brains,
and I say so.

13:18.064 --> 13:20.565
- Oh, you the brains?
- Yeah, that's right.

13:20.567 --> 13:23.731
- So, what does that make me?
- The eye candy.

13:23.766 --> 13:25.303
(Scoffs)

13:25.305 --> 13:27.472
So, we get a driver,
a pyrotechnics expert,

13:27.474 --> 13:29.073
and then we get
ourselves an a-team.

13:29.075 --> 13:31.276
Hmm, almost. Now we just
need a little heft.

13:31.278 --> 13:33.578
- Heft?
- Yeah.

13:33.580 --> 13:35.980
And your friend, Marty Stein,
he's the heft, right?

13:35.982 --> 13:39.828
That man's a leviathan.
You wanna get Campbell? Howard?

13:40.019 --> 13:42.086
We need someone
in their weight class.

13:42.088 --> 13:44.355
All right, so why are we sitting
out here, freezing our asses off?

13:44.357 --> 13:46.491
- Let's just go talk to him.
- Jesus Christ, will you relax?

13:50.296 --> 13:52.363
Why'd you come after me and my
friends the way you did?

13:53.666 --> 13:55.200
What do you mean?

13:55.202 --> 13:57.567
It's a simple question, Grace.

13:57.870 --> 13:59.504
I don't know, my job?

13:59.506 --> 14:02.140
No, I mean, the way that
you chose to go about it.

14:02.142 --> 14:03.541
I sized you up
and I took a shot.

14:03.543 --> 14:05.143
- Right, you studied us.
- Of course.

14:05.145 --> 14:06.678
And then you tried
to slow play me.

14:08.948 --> 14:11.716
(Sighing) I figured you'd see right
through it if we came right at you.

14:16.956 --> 14:19.290
Guys like Marty always want
to be in the loop.

14:19.292 --> 14:22.193
They want to know everybody's
business, all the time.

14:22.195 --> 14:23.862
The bomb I just dropped on him,

14:23.864 --> 14:25.964
there's no way
we don't get a reaction.

14:25.966 --> 14:28.666
- What does a reaction look like?
- I don't know yet.

14:28.668 --> 14:29.801
We'll know when
we see it, though.

14:35.374 --> 14:37.959
Hopefully.

14:38.577 --> 14:41.746
Things would be a whole lot easier if
you had just bled out in that hospital.

14:41.748 --> 14:45.782
(Scoffs)
At last, we agree.

14:56.662 --> 14:58.429
(Indistinct talking)

15:01.367 --> 15:04.168
- Get me something good.
- Uh-huh.

15:04.170 --> 15:06.170
- Some haul.
- Yeah, we'll see.

15:06.172 --> 15:08.239
Any problems?

15:08.241 --> 15:11.209
There was a couple in the back who tried
to deface some evidence. Patty got hit.

15:11.211 --> 15:13.309
What?

15:16.115 --> 15:18.751
Gonna wash up.

15:25.858 --> 15:29.093
Don't know shit
about no counterfeit nothing.

15:29.095 --> 15:32.764
Not what it looks like to me, Bindy.
You got felony fraud, felony fraud...

15:32.766 --> 15:35.533
- Looks like this is round three.
- Some bullshit.

15:35.535 --> 15:38.202
Oh, you know what happens
after round three, right?

15:38.204 --> 15:41.105
- Motherfucker gets knocked the fuck out?
- Yeah, that's right.

15:41.107 --> 15:43.074
So, is there something you
want to tell me, Bindy?

15:43.075 --> 15:44.635
What have I been saying?

15:44.644 --> 15:46.577
Got myself
on the upright, you hear?

15:46.579 --> 15:49.714
One of those copy bitches now.
Real legit.

15:49.716 --> 15:52.784
Check out my weak-ass
pay stub.

15:52.786 --> 15:56.154
Talent like this makes you wonder why Google
doesn't recruit out of Garfield Park.

15:56.156 --> 15:57.622
Google doesn't pay as much.

16:03.228 --> 16:04.896
Wait. Go back, go back.

16:08.467 --> 16:09.734
- Hey, D...
- Yo.

16:09.736 --> 16:10.635
Where they stash
my graphic designer?

16:10.637 --> 16:12.070
Patty's got her in two,
I think.

16:13.739 --> 16:15.073
- Can you print that out for me?
- Mmm-hmm.

16:15.075 --> 16:15.840
Thank you.

16:17.776 --> 16:19.477
What do you know
about this man?

16:21.313 --> 16:24.682
(Sighing)
Don't know shit about no man.

16:24.684 --> 16:28.252
My tech tells me you got real chops. Bet
Greenville'll put those skills to use,

16:28.254 --> 16:30.655
designing inmate posters
for talent shows and shit.

16:30.657 --> 16:32.824
That sounds pretty
fucking grim to me.

16:32.826 --> 16:35.293
Or maybe, Bindy, you can tell me what
you know about the man in the passport,

16:35.295 --> 16:38.033
and we can pretend you
called in sick to work today.

16:38.831 --> 16:42.266
Why this motherfucker so special to y'all?
Terrorist or some shit?

16:42.268 --> 16:44.602
Oh, you're
a concerned citizen, now?

16:44.604 --> 16:46.304
Just tryin' not to rough
my boy up too deep.

16:46.306 --> 16:48.206
All right, well, I got five
of your co-workers next door.

16:48.208 --> 16:49.674
You think they give
a shit about your boy?

16:53.045 --> 16:55.380
Name's AJ. He's the one
put in for the passport.

16:55.382 --> 16:57.048
All right,
where can we find him?

16:57.050 --> 16:58.516
- Works at Fillies.
Harper: - Fillies?

16:58.518 --> 17:00.651
Filmores, it's a strip joint.

17:00.653 --> 17:02.220
(Scoffing)
See, this motherfucker know.

17:04.656 --> 17:07.558
- AJ have a last name?
- Shit, probably.

17:12.464 --> 17:16.203
Walk me outside, maybe some of that
fresh air kindle my recollection.

17:34.319 --> 17:35.887
And you believe him?

17:38.157 --> 17:40.124
Then think, Marty.
What did you do?

17:41.760 --> 17:44.328
As if there's anything
I could have done.

17:44.330 --> 17:47.999
You know how sensitive
those military types are.

17:48.001 --> 17:51.936
Well then, tell me, please, tell me, what
horrible crime I could have committed?

17:51.938 --> 17:55.073
What calamitous slight
I could have made

17:55.075 --> 17:57.241
to squander
a 50-year relationship?

17:57.243 --> 17:59.610
I was best man at his wedding.
I was...

18:02.347 --> 18:05.383
I was godfather to his kids,
for Christ's sake. This...

18:05.385 --> 18:07.351
I didn't do anything.

18:07.353 --> 18:10.288
Obviously you did something
and now you just can't think of it.

18:10.290 --> 18:13.558
- That's what you have to say?
- Is there something else you'd prefer?

18:13.560 --> 18:16.427
I don't know. How about
a little perspective?

18:16.429 --> 18:19.897
My perspective is you're not
a terribly bright man.

18:19.899 --> 18:23.534
You never have been. And on top of that,
you can be a real son of a bitch.

18:23.536 --> 18:26.938
That's good, thank you.
Keep building me up like that.

18:26.940 --> 18:31.442
But everyone likes Lance.
And Lance likes you.

18:31.444 --> 18:34.979
He gives you credibility. And you've been
trading off that since you were kids.

18:34.981 --> 18:39.150
The only difference between now and then
is the playground got a little bigger.

18:39.152 --> 18:42.420
You think I give a shit
what people think?

18:42.422 --> 18:45.056
I think no one wants
to eat their lunch alone.

18:50.162 --> 18:53.404
(Sighs)
So, what should I do?

18:54.600 --> 18:58.770
He's turned on you, Marty.
That's as serious as it gets.

18:58.971 --> 19:00.338
He must know about the guns.

19:02.307 --> 19:06.137
All you can do now
is look him in the eye

19:06.745 --> 19:08.146
and see what you need to see.

19:10.282 --> 19:11.971
And then what?

19:13.418 --> 19:15.618
And then learn to live with it.

19:21.927 --> 19:23.027
(Sighs)

19:29.268 --> 19:31.602
Lance? Marty.

19:31.604 --> 19:34.272
Hey, listen, you feel like grabbing
some lunch before you go back?

19:36.542 --> 19:38.142
Okay, there's something
I got to do first.

19:38.144 --> 19:39.744
I'll meet you there
in a couple of hours.

19:49.888 --> 19:51.656
Start the car,
that's him there.

19:51.658 --> 19:52.957
(Engine starting)

20:05.871 --> 20:07.205
(Coughing)

20:10.142 --> 20:14.078
Your boy, Kelly, you trust him?

20:14.080 --> 20:16.347
Talia's got a mouth on her.

20:16.349 --> 20:18.649
Ain't no way.
She knows better than that.

20:18.651 --> 20:20.733
Your boy got it wrong.

20:24.356 --> 20:27.105
- Shit.
- Yeah.

20:29.661 --> 20:31.821
- All right. I'll deal with her.
- Good.

20:33.432 --> 20:35.499
Puts me in
a very difficult position.

20:35.501 --> 20:36.734
I hear that.

20:44.676 --> 20:46.677
Pebbles in a pond, Marlon.
(Chuckling)

20:46.679 --> 20:49.847
This is how small problems
become very big problems.

20:49.849 --> 20:50.748
Marty, I said
I'll deal with it.

20:50.750 --> 20:52.617
Somethin' else you need?

20:52.619 --> 20:54.151
How are the deliveries coming?

20:55.520 --> 20:57.922
The crates are coming in fine.

20:57.924 --> 21:00.758
Your boys aren't messing with them, right?
These things aren't toys.

21:08.066 --> 21:10.034
(Camera clicking)

21:33.058 --> 21:34.292
What did you get?

21:37.896 --> 21:39.714
You recognize him?

21:40.232 --> 21:42.233
Yeah, that's Marlon Dinard.

21:42.235 --> 21:44.402
- Who's Marlon?
- I'm not sure yet.

21:44.404 --> 21:47.274
He's connected to Marty in some way.
What'd they talk about?

21:47.773 --> 21:50.074
- I didn't get close enough.
- You didn't get close enough?

21:51.310 --> 21:52.310
There they are!

21:57.082 --> 21:59.317
(Engine starting)

22:09.594 --> 22:12.296
(Cell phone ringing)

22:12.298 --> 22:15.907
This is Freddy.
No, sir, nothing yet.

22:16.501 --> 22:18.257
No sign of them.

22:28.447 --> 22:32.316
- Excuse me, I'm looking for Mr. Baldwin.
- Who?

22:32.318 --> 22:33.951
Mr. Baldwin.

22:33.953 --> 22:36.895
- She means AJ.
- Oh.

22:38.824 --> 22:41.125
- AJ took his life a couple of days ago.
- (Sobbing)

22:41.127 --> 22:42.226
He killed himself?

22:44.796 --> 22:46.364
Sorry about that.

22:46.366 --> 22:49.333
Her and AJ were pretty close.
She's not over the loss.

22:49.335 --> 22:51.635
Did he give you any indication
that he was...

22:51.637 --> 22:53.971
No more or less
than anyone else around here.

22:53.973 --> 22:56.394
Excuse me, I gotta work.

23:03.148 --> 23:07.389
(Cell phone ringing)

23:07.552 --> 23:10.054
- Hey.
- Yeah, hey. Guess what?

23:10.056 --> 23:12.590
All those flappin' titties got you
thinking about a career change?

23:12.592 --> 23:15.226
The only flappin' titties
I wanna see are yours, Patty.

23:15.228 --> 23:18.162
<i>- What's goin' on?</i>
<i>- AJ's dead.</i>

23:18.164 --> 23:20.831
<i>- Apparently, he killed himself.</i>
<i>- Shit!</i>

23:20.833 --> 23:23.234
You want me to come down there and
help you with the questioning?

23:23.236 --> 23:26.237
You wish. Call the coroner.
Pull an autopsy.

23:26.239 --> 23:29.240
I want the full workup.
Profile, phone, bank records.

23:29.242 --> 23:31.675
And then, can you text me the address
that Kelly gave us when we pulled him in?

23:31.677 --> 23:33.711
Yes, master.

23:33.713 --> 23:34.912
All right, thank you.

23:39.918 --> 23:43.187
I heard ringing.
Honest to God, bells.

23:43.189 --> 23:46.357
I'm glad it was worth it. Took me six
weeks to save that roll of dimes.

23:46.359 --> 23:47.858
Pennies would've been quicker.

23:47.860 --> 23:50.861
Believe me, I tried.
I couldn't wrap my fist around 'em.

23:50.863 --> 23:54.398
- You were such a shrimp in those days.
- Big enough to cut you down.

23:54.400 --> 23:57.868
(Chuckling) I'll admit, the swing had
some zip for such a tiny little Jew.

23:57.870 --> 24:00.271
(Chuckling)

24:00.273 --> 24:03.541
Remember, we had to sit and
wait for Principal Marion?

24:03.543 --> 24:07.077
Oh, yeah. And you made me
sit in that fuckin' hot seat,

24:07.079 --> 24:08.879
the one that looked
right into her office.

24:08.881 --> 24:10.381
I thought we were goners.

24:10.383 --> 24:13.150
My brothers would have never
let me forget it,

24:13.152 --> 24:16.487
getting my ass kicked
by a pipsqueak like you.

24:16.489 --> 24:19.123
Are you kiddin' me? My father would
have straight up murdered me.

24:19.125 --> 24:21.559
No questions.
No conference with my mother.

24:21.561 --> 24:25.296
He would've taken me out back,
buried me, never mentioned my name again.

24:25.298 --> 24:29.233
I remember, you turned it all around on Sawchuck.
I remember watching you,

24:29.235 --> 24:31.735
- pretending like she was crazy.
- She was crazy.

24:31.737 --> 24:34.104
"We're best friends.
We were just fooling around."

24:34.106 --> 24:36.140
And a bullshit artist was born.

24:36.142 --> 24:39.410
How they bought that fucking
story, I will never know.

24:39.412 --> 24:42.766
Well, I guess we've always made
better friends than enemies.

24:44.349 --> 24:46.083
That's the truth.

24:49.154 --> 24:52.490
You know, to this day, I still
haven't been hit that hard.

24:52.492 --> 24:55.228
Do it again.

24:55.961 --> 24:57.394
(Elevator bell ringing)

24:58.663 --> 25:00.197
We should be closer.

25:00.199 --> 25:02.566
Easy. General Howard
would recognize either one of us.

25:08.540 --> 25:10.608
- Fuck it, I'm going to the bar.
- No, no, no. Grace, Grace.

25:14.779 --> 25:18.056
It's day one.
Let's not blow it on day one.

25:20.719 --> 25:24.321
- No, no...
- Let me get it, save your dimes.

25:24.323 --> 25:26.657
Please, on a military salary?

25:26.659 --> 25:28.559
Random house is giving me
an advance on the book.

25:30.028 --> 25:31.729
Just fine, thank you very much. _

25:31.731 --> 25:34.899
Yeah, but now you've got
to hire a hotshot lawyer

25:34.901 --> 25:37.635
'cause the DOD's gonna come after
you for spilling state secrets.

25:37.637 --> 25:39.203
If only I knew one.

25:43.375 --> 25:47.475
So, the Kelly kid.
He is working out.

25:47.579 --> 25:49.213
So...

25:49.215 --> 25:51.815
So, so, so.
What's with this obsession?

25:51.817 --> 25:55.486
Everybody starting a sentence
with "so" these days.

25:55.488 --> 25:59.490
So, it's a nice day out.
So, my dog has lip cancer.

25:59.492 --> 26:03.394
So, the Canadians have stormed the
border and captured the capital.

26:03.396 --> 26:05.729
- I never thought about it.
- It's an epidemic.

26:07.999 --> 26:10.134
I'm thinking of keeping him
around a while.

26:12.103 --> 26:14.322
Unless you need him back.

26:18.510 --> 26:21.278
I knew you two
would hit it off.

26:21.280 --> 26:23.280
You keep him
as long as you need him.

26:25.517 --> 26:26.817
Okay, good.

26:28.386 --> 26:31.855
- (Cell phone buzzing)
- Ah, shit!

26:31.857 --> 26:35.025
- What?
- Roberts is calling me in.

26:35.027 --> 26:36.860
You're a little busy.

26:36.862 --> 26:39.129
I've been blowing him off
all day, I can't not show up.

26:40.532 --> 26:43.809
- Give me an hour, okay?
- Which one should I follow?

26:44.369 --> 26:45.536
Stalker's choice.

26:51.543 --> 26:55.449
- You heading out?
- Yeah, I'm meeting Yasmine in the bar.

26:56.147 --> 26:58.334
- Have fun with that.
- All right.

26:58.383 --> 26:59.316
See ya.

27:32.250 --> 27:34.151
(Indistinct conversation)

27:39.658 --> 27:41.859
This is what you need, ma'am.
Have a good day.

27:48.867 --> 27:50.167
Close it.

27:51.936 --> 27:53.337
(Door closes)

27:55.807 --> 27:58.542
I had a conversation
with Marty today.

27:58.544 --> 28:00.644
- He apologize?
- Yeah.

28:00.646 --> 28:03.106
- He's sorry, all right.
- Good.

28:06.618 --> 28:09.613
- That it?
- Come sit over here, Talia.

28:14.459 --> 28:15.759
Come sit over here.

28:23.635 --> 28:27.841
When you hear my name,
what do you think?

28:28.807 --> 28:31.275
- What?
- Marlon. What does that mean to you?

28:32.510 --> 28:35.245
I don't know.
I mean, you my brother.

28:35.247 --> 28:37.715
Yeah, I know that.
But what does that mean?

28:40.051 --> 28:42.486
- What?
- What the fuck does my name mean?

28:42.488 --> 28:45.322
- Mar, I don't...
- Don't use my name.

28:45.324 --> 28:47.658
Don't use my name,
'cause you don't give a shit.

28:47.660 --> 28:50.661
You out there talkin' about
Marty, talkin' about his shit.

28:50.663 --> 28:54.264
- You talkin' about my shit.
- Mar, I'm sorry. I was upset.

28:54.266 --> 28:56.333
- Upset?
- I didn't mean to...

28:56.335 --> 28:58.268
I wasn't thinking.

28:58.270 --> 29:01.338
You wasn't thinking? When the
fuck do you ever think, Talia?

29:01.340 --> 29:03.774
You gonna bring
a motherfucker down!

29:03.776 --> 29:05.709
I'm spendin' my life
tryin' to put us up,

29:05.711 --> 29:08.011
you gonna bring a
motherfucker down, for what?

29:08.013 --> 29:11.248
- You're right, Marlon, I'm sorry.
- No. No, no...

29:11.250 --> 29:13.383
- I know, I messed up...
- No, fuck that shit.

29:13.385 --> 29:15.586
What do I have to do
to make you see?

29:15.588 --> 29:19.356
Huh? What do I have to do?

29:19.358 --> 29:22.793
What I do and what you do. Ain't
nothin' else, ain't nobody else.

29:22.795 --> 29:24.928
This is the only shit
that matters.

29:27.031 --> 29:30.267
You feel different about that,
let me know.

29:32.036 --> 29:33.837
Shit can change real quick.

30:02.834 --> 30:06.069
- Yes?
- Afternoon, sir, I'm Agent Deakins, DEA,

30:06.071 --> 30:07.371
I'm looking for Mr. Kelly.

30:08.740 --> 30:10.574
I'm Mr. Kelly.

30:10.576 --> 30:12.910
Oh, I'm sorry,
I'm looking for Ethan Kelly.

30:12.912 --> 30:15.012
Oh, well, you're about
20 years too late for that.

30:15.014 --> 30:17.114
He hasn't lived here
since he was in high school.

30:17.116 --> 30:20.083
- You're his father.
- I suppose you could call me that.

30:20.085 --> 30:23.520
- Do you have any idea where
I might find him? - Is he in trouble?

30:23.522 --> 30:27.457
No, it's nothing like that.
He's just helping us on an investigation.

30:27.459 --> 30:31.094
I needed a quick follow-up.
Wires must have gotten crossed.

30:31.096 --> 30:33.931
Well, you might find him at the Stein firm.
He's working there now.

30:33.933 --> 30:36.133
- Stein? Marty Stein?
- That's right.

30:36.135 --> 30:39.770
- Is that recent?
- Sorry, what did you say your name was?

30:39.772 --> 30:42.506
- Deakins. - Well, I'll tell him
you came looking for him.

30:42.508 --> 30:43.607
That'd be appreciated.

30:59.290 --> 31:00.057
(Exhales)

31:05.129 --> 31:06.897
So, what do you have for me?

31:06.899 --> 31:08.665
It's been a quiet day.

31:08.667 --> 31:10.868
- Is that so?
- Yeah.

31:10.870 --> 31:13.170
Marty met with his chandelier
guy, Marlon Dinard.

31:13.172 --> 31:15.261
I'll get Freddy to do
a background check on him.

31:15.296 --> 31:16.406
Nothing else?

31:17.508 --> 31:19.521
No. Good recon
takes time, Roberts.

31:21.145 --> 31:22.876
Well, you're the expert.

31:24.182 --> 31:25.415
Where do you think
you're going?

31:25.884 --> 31:26.717
Are we not done?

31:27.485 --> 31:29.219
Freddy will be by in a bit,

31:29.221 --> 31:32.256
I want you to look into that Dinard character.
See if anything pops up.

31:32.258 --> 31:34.591
- Okay. Well, I'll do it tomorrow.
- No. You'll do it now.

31:35.093 --> 31:36.059
Thanks for the coffee.

31:39.163 --> 31:40.564
(Exhales)

32:09.694 --> 32:11.795
Hey!
I got the workup on AJ.

32:11.797 --> 32:12.930
Harper: Oh, nice.

32:12.932 --> 32:15.032
Two tours in Afghanistan.

32:15.034 --> 32:18.035
Six years running ops for a private
contractor out of Kandahar.

32:18.037 --> 32:19.369
Votan Security.

32:19.371 --> 32:21.538
- That's Kelly's outfit.
- Oh, yeah?

32:21.540 --> 32:24.141
He caught a head injury from an IED
and the company shipped him home.

32:24.143 --> 32:26.376
Off and on disability
for the next five years.

32:26.378 --> 32:29.079
Misdemeanor bust for oxy.

32:29.081 --> 32:31.815
Worked a couple bouncing gigs
to pay for the lawyer fees.

32:31.817 --> 32:34.151
He tried to get a medical
pension out of Votan.

32:34.153 --> 32:35.018
Harper: Good luck with that.

32:36.788 --> 32:38.388
Coroner ruled it a suicide.

32:38.390 --> 32:40.624
One shot to the temple.

32:40.626 --> 32:42.559
Not hard to see why a guy like that would
wanna blow his brains out, though.

32:43.394 --> 32:44.995
You talked to Kelly?

32:44.997 --> 32:46.870
- Kinda.
- What's that mean?

32:46.898 --> 32:48.231
He wasn't home.

32:48.233 --> 32:49.733
His father said
he worked for Marty Stein.

32:49.735 --> 32:51.134
- Marty Stein?
- Hmm.

32:51.136 --> 32:52.903
Why do I know that name?

32:52.905 --> 32:55.147
Oh, is that the guy
who reps the Sox?

32:55.182 --> 32:56.573
Hey, check this out.

32:57.842 --> 33:01.167
I think AJ and Hutchings got
a call from the same number.

33:01.579 --> 33:02.646
Who was that?

33:02.648 --> 33:04.434
Sophie Hale.

33:04.469 --> 33:05.582
Huh.

33:05.584 --> 33:08.585
What would a bouncer,
a lawyer and ex-soldier

33:08.587 --> 33:10.720
have in common
with a dead reporter?

33:10.955 --> 33:12.635
Let's find out.

33:32.944 --> 33:34.111
(Scoffs)

33:34.113 --> 33:35.949
(Whispering)
I won't say anything.

33:36.714 --> 33:38.115
I'm sorry?

33:38.117 --> 33:38.949
The man you're with...

33:39.817 --> 33:40.951
It's General Howard, right?

33:40.953 --> 33:42.686
I recognized him from C-SPAN.

33:44.288 --> 33:45.883
Is that so?

33:46.157 --> 33:48.367
Don't worry.
I won't tell his wife.

33:48.793 --> 33:49.693
(Scoffs)

33:50.862 --> 33:52.729
Actually, his wife
already knows.

33:53.364 --> 33:54.829
The whole thing was her idea.

33:55.800 --> 33:56.700
Oh...

33:57.568 --> 33:59.554
And you fell for that?

34:01.139 --> 34:02.858
I'm his biographer.

34:04.642 --> 34:06.578
Whatever gets you off.

34:23.594 --> 34:24.728
Sophie Hale?

34:24.730 --> 34:25.728
Haven't seen her.

34:26.597 --> 34:28.931
Agent Deakins, DEA.

34:29.500 --> 34:31.501
Your assistant said
we would find you here.

34:31.536 --> 34:33.170
Did she mention I was on lunch?

34:33.172 --> 34:35.172
Sorry to ambush you like this,
Miss Hale,

34:35.174 --> 34:37.774
but if you've got a second,
we'd really appreciate it.

34:37.775 --> 34:40.944
We wanna ask you a few
questions about AJ Baldwin.

34:40.946 --> 34:43.210
- Who?
Harper: - You don't recognize the name?

34:43.614 --> 34:45.348
Not off the top of my head.

34:45.350 --> 34:48.418
Then can you tell me why your cell
phone made a 48-second call to him,

34:48.420 --> 34:50.466
Thursday night,
at 1:00 in the morning?

34:52.523 --> 34:54.391
No, actually, I can't.

34:54.393 --> 34:56.530
Can you tell us what
you were doing that night?

34:56.565 --> 34:57.027
Hmm.

34:58.296 --> 35:00.630
I was with a friend,

35:00.632 --> 35:03.276
we made spaghetti
and then he fucked my brains out.

35:05.470 --> 35:07.037
How about the name
Adam Hutchings?

35:07.039 --> 35:08.872
Does that mean anything to you?

35:08.874 --> 35:11.036
I suppose that's what
your records tell you.

35:11.642 --> 35:13.710
Well, Agent Deakins, I think
you're going to have to explain

35:13.712 --> 35:16.743
what this is all about if you
want me to say anything more.

35:16.778 --> 35:19.216
There's nothing to explain.

35:19.218 --> 35:22.715
At the moment, we're just trying to make
sense of a few strange coincidences.

35:22.887 --> 35:23.787
Such as?

35:25.389 --> 35:27.624
You made contact with both
Hutchings and Baldwin,

35:27.626 --> 35:30.604
both of who are dead under
suspicious circumstances.

35:31.929 --> 35:35.143
They also knew Ethan Kelly, who works
with you at Marty Stein's law firm.

35:35.566 --> 35:36.933
(Sighs)

35:36.935 --> 35:38.568
Well, that is strange.

35:38.570 --> 35:39.336
Harper: And why is that?

35:41.305 --> 35:43.697
Because I had no idea
that Mr. Kelly worked with me.

35:44.909 --> 35:46.787
Are you saying
you've never met him before?

35:48.012 --> 35:50.147
I'm saying, I'm done
volunteering my time.

35:50.149 --> 35:52.191
You want anything more,
get a subpoena.

36:34.378 --> 36:36.297
_

36:42.967 --> 36:44.100
(Cell phone buzzing)

36:47.672 --> 36:48.905
What do you want?

36:48.907 --> 36:51.208
The General's
fucking his biographer.

36:51.210 --> 36:52.063
That's original.

36:52.064 --> 36:53.172
Grace: <i>Yeah.</i>
<i>They just left the hotel.</i>

36:53.207 --> 36:56.012
So, I'm gonna check the room,
see what I can find.

36:56.014 --> 36:57.247
Ethan: <i>All right.</i>
<i>Well, listen...</i>

36:57.249 --> 36:59.349
<i>I'm stuck here for a bit.</i>

36:59.351 --> 37:00.350
<i>Give me a couple of hours, I'll
meet you back at the hotel room.</i>

37:00.352 --> 37:01.251
Can't wait.

37:13.731 --> 37:16.066
- Sorry, ma'am.
- Oh! No, not a problem.

38:42.353 --> 38:43.520
(Grunting)

39:32.503 --> 39:33.303
(Yelling)

39:38.476 --> 39:39.409
(Shouting)

39:49.987 --> 39:51.221
(Choking)

40:17.548 --> 40:18.948
(Panting)

40:50.781 --> 40:52.982
(Cell phone vibrating)

40:54.103 --> 40:56.855
_

41:12.236 --> 41:13.837
It's about fuckin' time.

41:13.839 --> 41:16.072
Sorry. Got caught up.

41:16.074 --> 41:19.353
Yeah, we should do this tomorrow.
Go home.

41:24.915 --> 41:26.782
(Exhales)

41:27.418 --> 41:29.501
Let Roberts know I waited.

41:33.924 --> 41:34.724
(Keypad beeping)

41:34.725 --> 41:37.296
_

41:43.601 --> 41:44.367
(Door opens)

42:31.415 --> 42:32.582
Why you?

42:34.585 --> 42:36.795
I'm not sure
I understand the question.

42:37.154 --> 42:39.069
Why send you?

42:39.189 --> 42:41.927
Lance is a very powerful guy.

42:42.826 --> 42:45.828
Why go through back channels like this?
He wants to bury me.

42:45.830 --> 42:47.096
Are you asking what they
told me or my opinion?

42:48.198 --> 42:50.400
How about whatever's
so close to the truth,

42:50.402 --> 42:52.277
you can kiss it on the lips.

42:52.369 --> 42:54.370
It feels personal,

42:54.372 --> 42:56.005
like he wants to embarrass you.

42:56.007 --> 42:57.684
And so, your job is to what?

42:57.741 --> 42:59.442
Befriend me and then sabotage?

42:59.444 --> 43:01.207
- Whistleblower?
- Yeah, something like that.

43:02.713 --> 43:04.514
- And now, you've had a change of heart?
- No. No.

43:05.516 --> 43:06.849
No?

43:06.851 --> 43:09.272
I'm not here
voluntarily, Marty.

43:12.423 --> 43:14.791
What the fuck does that mean?

43:14.793 --> 43:17.060
It means, I think that you and I
could be valuable to each other.

43:17.062 --> 43:18.695
That's what it means.

43:18.697 --> 43:20.563
The only way you're valuable
to me is if I can trust you,

43:20.565 --> 43:22.966
and I can't trust you
as far as I can spit.

43:22.968 --> 43:25.402
You got a long list of people
you can trust right now?

43:31.575 --> 43:32.375
All right.

43:35.412 --> 43:37.902
(Clears throat)
What do you propose?

43:38.082 --> 43:40.049
You know what, I'm all done
with propositions today.

43:40.051 --> 43:41.703
I figure it's your turn.

43:43.220 --> 43:45.254
The only way this works,
you and me,

43:45.256 --> 43:46.889
is if you tell me everything.

43:46.891 --> 43:49.290
Every fucking thing.

43:49.325 --> 43:51.394
From soup to nuts.

43:51.396 --> 43:53.630
- All right.
- We get to the end of the story,

43:53.632 --> 43:55.298
and if you've
left anything out...

43:55.300 --> 43:57.436
we're done, we're finished.

43:57.601 --> 43:59.836
- Understand?
- Yeah.

43:59.838 --> 44:02.171
Where would you
like me to start?

44:02.173 --> 44:03.706
Why don't you
start with the soup?

44:09.313 --> 44:12.115
After the planes hit the towers,
I walked out of Harvard Law.

44:12.117 --> 44:14.083
I joined the army,

44:14.085 --> 44:15.184
to fight for my country.

44:48.118 --> 44:49.552
My friend, who was
trying to kill me,

44:49.554 --> 44:51.619
and I stabbed him
in the neck with a...

44:54.491 --> 44:56.151
Ah, it doesn't matter.

44:57.194 --> 44:59.070
And I got, uh...

44:59.963 --> 45:02.133
I got shot by
a federal officer.

45:04.368 --> 45:06.377
I was laid in a hospital.

45:06.704 --> 45:09.471
I was drugged
for three days and...

45:12.409 --> 45:14.522
Hmm, gave me time to sit and...

45:16.146 --> 45:19.807
And just go back and look at all the
things that happened between us all.

45:21.819 --> 45:26.210
Then, I boarded a plane and they sent me
here to Chicago, darkening your doorstep.

45:29.393 --> 45:30.727
I suppose,
this is the first time

45:30.729 --> 45:34.531
that I've said it all out loud.

45:43.173 --> 45:45.183
Jesus.
