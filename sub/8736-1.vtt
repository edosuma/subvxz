02:21.591 --> 02:26.392
The first time I ever saw a movie
at the Cinémathèque Française, I thought:

02:26.462 --> 02:31.923
"Only the French. Only the French
would house a cinema inside a palace".

02:42.612 --> 02:45.911
<i>The movie was Sam Fuller's
Shock Corridor.</i>

02:45.982 --> 02:51.147
Its images were so powerful,
it was like being hypnotized.

02:52.388 --> 02:58.327
I was 20 years old. It was the late '60s, and
I'd come to Paris for a year to study French.

02:58.394 --> 03:01.693
But it was here that I got my real education.

03:02.699 --> 03:07.033
I became a member of what in those days
was kind of a Freemasonry -

03:07.103 --> 03:09.594
the Freemasonry of cinephiles.

03:09.672 --> 03:12.368
What we'd call "film buffs".

03:19.215 --> 03:25.211
I was one of the insatiables. The ones you'd
always find sitting closest to the screen.

03:26.489 --> 03:29.253
Why did we sit so close?

03:29.325 --> 03:32.783
Maybe it was because
we wanted to receive the images first,

03:32.862 --> 03:36.059
when they were still new, still fresh.

03:36.132 --> 03:39.431
Before they cleared
the hurdles of the rows behind us.

03:39.502 --> 03:44.235
Before they had been relayed back
from row to row, spectator to spectator,

03:44.307 --> 03:49.870
until, worn out, the size of a postage stamp,
they returned to the projectionist's cabin.

03:53.182 --> 03:56.583
Maybe, too, the screen really was a screen.

03:56.653 --> 03:59.383
It screened us from the world.

04:10.767 --> 04:15.204
But there was one evening,
in the spring of 1968,

04:15.271 --> 04:19.036
when the world
finally burst through the screen.

04:19.108 --> 04:22.839
The pawn of an obscure coalition
of dubious interests,

04:22.912 --> 04:25.107
the Minister Malraux has driven

04:25.181 --> 04:28.981
Henri Langlois
out of the Cinémathèque Française.

04:29.052 --> 04:32.021
It offered us all
a free and fair conception

04:32.088 --> 04:34.181
of film culture.

04:34.257 --> 04:37.954
Now, for bureaucratic reasons,
culture's arch enemies

04:38.027 --> 04:40.552
have seized this bastion of liberty.

04:42.131 --> 04:43.530
Resist them!

04:43.599 --> 04:46.534
- Liberty isn't given!
- It's taken!

04:46.602 --> 04:48.035
All who love film...

04:48.104 --> 04:49.969
- in France...
- and abroad...

04:50.039 --> 04:51.028
<i>...are with you.</i>

04:51.107 --> 04:53.905
And with Henri Langlois!

05:03.252 --> 05:06.449
It was Henri Langlois
who created the Cinémathèque,

05:06.522 --> 05:11.425
because he liked to show movies instead of
letting them rot in some underground vault.

05:11.494 --> 05:14.554
He'd show any movies - good, bad, old, new.

05:14.630 --> 05:17.394
Silents, Westerns, thrillers.

05:17.467 --> 05:22.461
And all the New Wave filmmakers
came here to learn their craft.

05:22.538 --> 05:25.598
This is where modern cinema was born.

05:25.675 --> 05:27.939
What lies behind it:

05:28.011 --> 05:30.275
The police!

05:31.714 --> 05:34.148
Langlois had been sacked
by the government,

05:34.217 --> 05:38.813
and it seemed like every film buff
in Paris had turned out in protest.

05:38.888 --> 05:41.413
It was our very own cultural revolution.

06:06.516 --> 06:08.507
Excuse me.

06:11.120 --> 06:13.281
Can you remove this?

06:13.356 --> 06:15.483
It's stuck to my lips.

06:16.192 --> 06:19.491
Can you remove my cigarette? It's stuck.

06:19.562 --> 06:21.757
Yes, yes...

06:21.831 --> 06:23.355
Of course.

06:25.001 --> 06:26.935
Sorry.

06:27.937 --> 06:30.929
- What are you? English?
- No, I'm American.

06:31.007 --> 06:33.498
You can put it out now.

06:36.913 --> 06:39.381
- What's your name?
- Matthew.

06:39.449 --> 06:42.418
You're here a lot.
But you never talk to anyone.

06:42.485 --> 06:44.885
We've been wondering
why you're always alone.

06:44.954 --> 06:47.479
I don't really know anybody.

06:48.491 --> 06:53.952
- How come you're chained to the gates?
- I'm not chained to the gates.

06:56.265 --> 06:58.995
- You're awfully clean.
- What?

06:59.068 --> 07:01.628
For someone who likes the cinema so much.

07:01.704 --> 07:03.763
- Do you know Jacques?
- Jacques?

07:03.840 --> 07:06.968
If shit could shit,
it would smell just like Jacques.

07:07.043 --> 07:11.139
My brother's gone to talk to him. When
he gets back, you'll smell Jacques on him.

07:11.214 --> 07:13.842
It's like being around pigs.

07:14.984 --> 07:17.350
- You speak English really well.
- What?

07:17.420 --> 07:21.447
- You speak English really well.
- My mother's English.

07:21.524 --> 07:25.620
- Here's Theo. When I introduce you, sniff.
- Come on.

07:25.695 --> 07:28.220
Truffaut, Godard, Chabrol, Rivette,

07:28.297 --> 07:31.789
and Renoir, Jean Rouch,
Rohmer are here.

07:31.868 --> 07:34.666
Signoret, Jean Marais
and God knows who else.

07:34.737 --> 07:35.965
Marcel Carné too.

07:36.038 --> 07:37.733
Why is Carné here?

07:37.807 --> 07:41.174
What should we do?
Stay or leave?

07:41.244 --> 07:43.542
I don't know.

07:43.613 --> 07:44.875
Theo.

07:44.947 --> 07:47.438
This is Matthew.

07:47.517 --> 07:50.042
- You were right - he's American.
- Hi.

07:52.989 --> 07:56.823
I've seen you around. You've been
coming to all the Nicholas Rays.

07:56.893 --> 07:59.384
Yeah. I really like his movies.

07:59.462 --> 08:02.056
<i>What? They Live by Night?</i>

08:02.131 --> 08:07.501
<i>More like Johnny Guitar
and Rebel Without a Cause.</i>

08:07.570 --> 08:10.937
- You know what Godard wrote about him?
- No, what?

08:11.007 --> 08:13.271
"Nicholas Ray is cinema".

08:14.310 --> 08:16.335
- What's up with you?
- Me?

08:16.412 --> 08:18.710
Come on, stick with me!

08:51.447 --> 08:52.778
Fascists!

08:52.848 --> 08:55.316
- Bastards!
- Assholes!

08:58.988 --> 09:03.220
And that was how I first met
Theo and Isabelle.

09:11.567 --> 09:14.195
I could hear my heart pounding.

09:14.270 --> 09:17.569
I don't know if it was because
I'd just been chased by the police

09:17.640 --> 09:20.871
or because I was already in love
with my new friends.

09:20.943 --> 09:26.848
As we walked and talked, and talked,
and talked - about politics, about movies,

09:26.916 --> 09:29.942
and why the French could never
produce a good rock band...

09:30.019 --> 09:32.886
- I'm starving.
- I forgot the sandwiches.

09:32.955 --> 09:35.856
<i>...I didn't want that night ever to end.</i>

09:39.695 --> 09:44.894
- Didn't you bring anything?
- No, I'm OK. Please, eat. Don't mind me.

09:46.402 --> 09:49.735
- No, I'm really not hungry.
- I've broken it now. Take it.

09:49.805 --> 09:53.332
- You're very kind, but I don't...
- Take it when you're offered it.

09:53.409 --> 09:55.070
Thank you.

09:55.144 --> 09:56.543
- Theo.
- What?

09:56.612 --> 09:59.240
- Don't you have something for Matthew?
- This is fine.

09:59.315 --> 10:02.409
- I gave him a third of mine.
- OK.

10:04.954 --> 10:08.117
I really... I didn't come here
to eat your sandwiches.

10:08.190 --> 10:10.988
- He doesn't want it.
- Yes, he does.

10:11.060 --> 10:15.053
- He's too polite to say he does, aren't you?
- You're both very kind.

10:15.131 --> 10:17.827
So, where are you from exactly?

10:17.900 --> 10:19.800
San Diego.

10:19.869 --> 10:23.805
What about you two?
Were you both born in Paris?

10:23.873 --> 10:28.401
I entered this world
on the Champs Elysées. 1959.

10:28.477 --> 10:30.672
The pavement
of the Champs Elysées.

10:30.746 --> 10:33.681
And you know
what my very first words were?

10:33.749 --> 10:37.879
- No. What?
- "New York Herald Tribune".

10:45.795 --> 10:48.628
Will you come to Rome with me?

10:52.935 --> 10:55.096
Here. Right here. Here.

10:55.171 --> 10:57.696
No, there!

10:57.773 --> 11:01.231
- Good night, Matthew.
- Night.

11:49.992 --> 11:52.085
Dear Mom,

11:52.528 --> 11:55.019
I got some real news this time.

11:56.632 --> 12:00.159
I've just met my first French friends.

12:44.346 --> 12:45.813
Hello?

12:45.881 --> 12:49.317
- Matthew?
- Who is this?

12:49.385 --> 12:52.548
- Don't be so suspicious. It's me.
- Theo?

12:52.621 --> 12:57.058
- Don't tell me I woke you up.
- No, I've been up for ages.

12:57.126 --> 12:59.424
You don't sound as if
you've been up for ages.

12:59.495 --> 13:01.622
I always sound like this in the morning.

13:01.697 --> 13:04.860
Sorry, I have to call you early
because I've got a class at nine.

13:04.934 --> 13:09.633
- Right.
- You want to have dinner tomorrow night?

13:13.309 --> 13:16.710
You mean like a real dinner
in a nice restaurant?

13:16.779 --> 13:19.942
No, no. Not in a restaurant. Here. At home.

13:20.716 --> 13:23.207
Yeah. Sure, that would be great.

13:23.285 --> 13:27.619
- Yes? OK. Why don't you...
- Please get off the phone. It's nine o'clock.

13:27.690 --> 13:31.786
Yes, yes. Why don't you meet us
for a drink first? At the Respite.

13:31.861 --> 13:35.058
Six o'clock. You know where it is?

13:35.130 --> 13:38.031
- Boulevard Saint-Germain?
- Be there at six.

13:46.842 --> 13:49.572
Third floor!

13:49.645 --> 13:52.011
You know, there's room in here for all of us.

13:52.081 --> 13:54.242
Theo and I are contagious.

13:55.217 --> 13:58.778
- We are very contagious.
- Contagious?

13:58.854 --> 14:01.254
You mustn't catch us.

14:19.141 --> 14:21.939
- It's beautiful.
- You think so?

14:22.011 --> 14:24.002
Good luck.

14:32.187 --> 14:34.178
Evening, mother.

14:35.958 --> 14:37.755
What are you doing here?

14:37.826 --> 14:39.726
- We're here for dinner.
- What?

14:39.795 --> 14:41.763
With Matthew.

14:41.830 --> 14:44.355
- Didn't Isabelle say?
- Which Matthew?

14:44.433 --> 14:47.561
This Matthew. He's our new friend.

14:47.636 --> 14:50.469
- Matthew, this is my mother.
- Hi.

14:50.539 --> 14:53.872
- Very pleased to meet you, Matthew.
- Likewise.

14:53.943 --> 14:57.879
- You're American, are you?
- Yeah, I'm from California.

14:57.947 --> 15:03.977
Matthew lives in a nasty student hotel.
Rue Malebranche. So we invited him to dinner.

15:04.053 --> 15:05.020
What's wrong?

15:05.087 --> 15:08.420
What can I say, Isabelle?
I'm cooking for two

15:08.490 --> 15:10.151
and now there are five of us.

15:10.225 --> 15:11.453
Didn't Theo tell you?

15:11.527 --> 15:14.155
No, he didn't. And neither did you.

15:14.229 --> 15:17.323
Have you got mashed potatoes
for brains or what?

15:17.399 --> 15:21.165
- You were supposed to tell her!
- You're crazy!

15:21.236 --> 15:23.500
Bitch, cow, slut...

15:23.572 --> 15:26.735
For God's sake, put a sock in it, you two.

15:29.078 --> 15:32.047
I must apologize
for my children's behavior, Matthew.

15:32.114 --> 15:35.447
No, I'm the one who should be apologizing.

15:35.517 --> 15:37.951
Please, don't put yourself out
on account of me.

15:38.020 --> 15:40.750
That's sweet of you.
You're completely blameless.

15:44.193 --> 15:46.388
Let me look at you.

15:47.129 --> 15:50.895
OK. I want you to make
a good impression on Papa.

16:02.211 --> 16:03.769
Papa, it's me.

16:03.846 --> 16:05.746
We're eating in.

16:05.814 --> 16:07.475
And the Cinémathèque?

16:07.549 --> 16:09.813
Closed until further notice.

16:09.885 --> 16:11.216
Papa!

16:11.286 --> 16:13.447
Can't you see we have a guest?

16:13.522 --> 16:15.786
This is Matthew.

16:17.092 --> 16:19.117
- Sir.
- Matthew.

16:19.194 --> 16:22.163
Matthew's dining with us tonight.

16:22.431 --> 16:26.561
My young Matthew, inspiration is like a baby.

16:26.635 --> 16:30.765
It does not choose a nice,
seemly hour to enter the world.

16:31.273 --> 16:35.209
It has no consideration for the poor poet.

16:36.578 --> 16:39.012
But when it does come,

16:39.081 --> 16:42.710
when it deigns to come,
then you know it's...

16:48.323 --> 16:53.124
Young man. I was speaking to you.
I imagined you were listening.

16:53.195 --> 16:55.527
I was. I'm sorry.

16:57.166 --> 16:58.827
What?

16:59.835 --> 17:02.633
Nothing. I was... I was just...

17:04.506 --> 17:09.808
You seem to be mesmerized
by this tin lighter. I'd like to know why.

17:12.114 --> 17:14.674
- Well?
- George, please. Matthew's our guest.

17:14.750 --> 17:19.346
No, I'm genuinely curious.
I'd like to know why.

17:22.790 --> 17:27.160
I was just... I was fidgeting
with Isabelle's lighter.

17:27.229 --> 17:30.255
I wasn't realizing it,
and I noticed and thought it was rude

17:30.332 --> 17:32.664
so I put it down on the table.

17:32.735 --> 17:37.570
But I put it diagonally across
one of these squares, do you see?

17:37.639 --> 17:39.630
Look.

17:39.708 --> 17:45.578
I noticed that the lighter's length is exactly
the same length as the diagonal itself.

17:45.647 --> 17:47.911
So I put it lengthwise.

17:48.917 --> 17:51.977
Along the outside edge. Look.

17:52.054 --> 17:54.352
- It fits there too.
- Yeah.

17:55.457 --> 17:58.119
But it fits there.

17:58.794 --> 18:02.195
And it fits like this. And like this.

18:02.898 --> 18:05.526
And this way, too.

18:05.601 --> 18:08.900
I bet you if I just split it in half,

18:09.738 --> 18:11.865
it's gotta fit somewhere.

18:12.908 --> 18:16.639
I mean, it really fits anywhere. Look.

18:16.712 --> 18:18.509
You see?

18:18.580 --> 18:22.141
I was noticing that
the more you look at everything -

18:22.217 --> 18:25.618
this table, the objects on it, the refrigerator,

18:25.687 --> 18:27.780
this room, your nose,

18:27.856 --> 18:30.222
the world -

18:30.292 --> 18:34.524
suddenly, you realize that

18:34.596 --> 18:37.827
there's some sort of cosmic harmony

18:37.900 --> 18:40.494
of shapes and sizes.

18:43.005 --> 18:45.235
I was just wondering why.

18:45.307 --> 18:47.571
I don't know why that is.

18:47.643 --> 18:50.111
I know that it is.

18:56.852 --> 18:59.514
You have an interesting friend here.

18:59.588 --> 19:03.024
More interesting, I suspect, than you know.

19:05.460 --> 19:10.124
I mean, when we look around us,
what is it we see?

19:12.134 --> 19:15.001
Complete chaos.

19:15.070 --> 19:17.265
Yet, viewed from above -

19:17.339 --> 19:20.672
viewed, as it were, by God -

19:20.742 --> 19:23.609
everything suddenly fits together.

19:26.215 --> 19:32.916
My children believe that their demonstrations
and sit-ins and happenings...

19:33.956 --> 19:39.258
Well, they believe that these possess
the capacity not only to provoke society,

19:39.328 --> 19:41.819
but also to transform it.

19:46.969 --> 19:51.702
What is it you are saying? If Langlois
is dismissed we shouldn't do anything?

19:51.773 --> 19:56.540
If immigrants are deported, if students
are beaten up, we shouldn't do anything?

19:56.612 --> 20:00.810
All I am saying is
that a little lucidity would not go amiss.

20:00.883 --> 20:03.818
So everyone's wrong but you?

20:04.887 --> 20:07.583
In France? In Italy? Germany? America?

20:07.656 --> 20:13.595
Listen to me. Before you can change the
world, you must realize you are part of it.

20:13.662 --> 20:17.098
You cannot stand outside, looking in.

20:17.165 --> 20:20.100
You're the one who stands outside.

20:20.168 --> 20:23.331
You refused to sign a petition
against the Vietnam war.

20:23.405 --> 20:26.670
Poets don't sign petitions, they sign poems.

20:27.409 --> 20:30.435
- A petition is a poem.
- Yes.

20:30.512 --> 20:33.811
And a poem is a petition.
Thank you, but I'm not gaga yet.

20:33.882 --> 20:37.113
I don't need you
to remind me of my own work.

20:37.853 --> 20:39.411
That's right.

20:39.488 --> 20:42.480
A petition is a poem,
a poem is a petition.

20:42.557 --> 20:48.018
- Yes.
- The most famous lines you ever wrote.

20:49.097 --> 20:51.429
Now look at you.

20:53.568 --> 20:56.298
I hope I'll never be like him.

20:57.706 --> 21:03.406
We should say good night, darling.
We've got a long day ahead of us tomorrow.

21:03.478 --> 21:05.036
George.

21:05.113 --> 21:07.513
Yes, sorry. You were saying?

21:07.582 --> 21:09.015
We should get to bed.

21:11.520 --> 21:15.115
You had something to tell
the children, didn't you?

21:15.190 --> 21:16.851
Yes, of course.

21:16.925 --> 21:18.392
I'm sorry.

21:18.460 --> 21:20.792
The checks are on the mantelpiece.

21:20.862 --> 21:24.525
Don't cash them until
you need them, all right?

21:26.101 --> 21:28.661
Good night, everybody.

21:28.737 --> 21:31.535
Good night, papa.
Have a safe journey.

21:31.606 --> 21:33.233
Good night, dear.

21:33.308 --> 21:34.969
Theo.

21:36.278 --> 21:42.148
- A very good night to you, Matthew.
- It was a pleasure meeting you, sir.

21:42.217 --> 21:45.516
- Very nice meeting you.
- You too. Thank you so much for dinner.

21:45.587 --> 21:46.849
My pleasure.

21:46.922 --> 21:52.087
Why don't you spend the night? I'm not sure
I like the sound of Hotel Malebranche.

21:52.160 --> 21:54.151
Good night.

22:20.655 --> 22:25.422
Why haven't you dazzled us with these
philosophical speculations of yours?

22:25.494 --> 22:27.826
I didn't know I was being philosophical.

22:27.896 --> 22:32.492
- Papa was awfully impressed.
- Papa's full of shit.

22:32.567 --> 22:36.867
I think you're lucky.
I wish my parents were that nice.

22:36.938 --> 22:41.068
Other people's parents
are always nicer than our own.

22:41.143 --> 22:46.513
And yet our own grandparents
are always nicer than other people's.

22:48.216 --> 22:51.083
You know, that's true.
That's absolutely true.

22:51.153 --> 22:54.850
I never thought about it before, but it's true.

22:54.923 --> 22:57.153
Matthew, you're sweet.

22:59.261 --> 23:03.459
This is double the length of...

23:06.701 --> 23:09.033
I'm for bed.

23:21.349 --> 23:23.476
Are you staying?

23:24.486 --> 23:26.977
- Are you OK?
- Yeah, I'm OK.

23:28.457 --> 23:30.186
Good night, Matthew.

23:41.336 --> 23:43.998
Everybody's got a father.

23:44.072 --> 23:45.869
Yes.

23:45.941 --> 23:51.538
But the fact that God doesn't exist
doesn't mean he can take his place.

24:36.391 --> 24:37.881
OK?

24:40.462 --> 24:43.124
- Yeah, it's fine.
- Good night.

24:43.198 --> 24:45.325
- Good night.
- See you in the morning.

24:45.400 --> 24:48.267
See you. Thank...

24:48.336 --> 24:50.327
Thank you.

28:02.664 --> 28:04.825
Good morning.

28:07.635 --> 28:09.660
What was that all about?

28:09.738 --> 28:11.865
I was removing the sleep from your eyes.

28:11.940 --> 28:15.103
Theo lets me do his every morning.

28:16.111 --> 28:18.443
It's a strange thing to want to do.

28:18.513 --> 28:20.811
Didn't you enjoy it?

28:21.549 --> 28:24.450
- Was I supposed to?
- Naturally.

28:31.593 --> 28:32.958
Up.

28:33.027 --> 28:37.657
- What are you waiting for?
- Isabelle, I'm not dressed.

29:37.292 --> 29:38.884
What are you doing?

29:38.960 --> 29:44.921
- What are you doing?
- I've been memorizing this room.

29:44.999 --> 29:48.059
In the future, in my memory,

29:48.136 --> 29:52.129
I shall live a great deal in this room.

29:52.207 --> 29:54.107
<i>Queen Christina.</i>

29:54.175 --> 29:58.168
Where Garbo bids farewell to the room
in which she spent the night with Gilbert.

29:58.246 --> 30:00.976
Bravo!

30:01.049 --> 30:05.247
We have a private wing to ourselves.
The bathroom's at the end of the corridor.

30:05.320 --> 30:10.314
If you aren't there in one minute,
we're coming back to get you.

30:40.822 --> 30:42.813
Come in.

30:44.859 --> 30:47.020
Good morning.

30:47.095 --> 30:49.586
Are you going to church?

30:53.067 --> 30:56.434
Oh, sorry. You want to use my toothbrush?

30:56.504 --> 30:58.301
- No.
- Sure?

30:58.373 --> 31:00.705
I'll use my finger.

31:06.948 --> 31:09.815
- Sleep well?
- Yeah.

31:09.884 --> 31:12.216
I mean, fine.

31:22.497 --> 31:28.265
You know, Matthew, you really do
have the most beautiful pair of lips.

31:30.038 --> 31:32.632
Can I touch them?

31:33.641 --> 31:37.202
You wanna touch my lips?

31:37.278 --> 31:39.337
OK.

31:43.985 --> 31:45.976
They're so red,

31:46.054 --> 31:47.988
and ripe

31:48.056 --> 31:49.853
and luscious.

31:49.924 --> 31:52.085
So sullen.

31:52.160 --> 31:54.822
Brutal.

31:54.896 --> 31:58.059
- Let's see what you'd look like with lipstick.
- I should go.

31:58.132 --> 32:01.533
- You'd make such a pretty girl.
- Ignore her, Matthew.

32:01.603 --> 32:08.202
- She sucks in all the air around her.
- I really have to be getting back to my hotel.

32:08.276 --> 32:12.042
No. Why?
We were going to invite you to stay.

32:12.113 --> 32:13.944
- Really?
- Sure.

32:14.015 --> 32:17.314
Our parents are going to be
in Trouville for a month.

32:17.385 --> 32:21.344
We thought you might like
to move your things here.

32:21.422 --> 32:23.788
- Really?
- Sure.

32:23.858 --> 32:27.521
But you just met me two days ago.
You barely even know me.

32:27.595 --> 32:30.428
This way we get to know you.
Do you have to stay in the hotel?

32:30.498 --> 32:35.026
- No.
- We'll go and pick up what you need. OK?

32:35.103 --> 32:37.264
Come on.

32:37.338 --> 32:39.829
What about you?

32:42.310 --> 32:44.073
It was my idea.

32:45.480 --> 32:48.074
You're scaring me right now.

32:49.250 --> 32:51.445
Jesus.

32:51.619 --> 32:53.610
Jesus.

32:56.791 --> 32:59.487
I'm going to check out
the Cinémathèque, just in case.

32:59.560 --> 33:01.653
- OK.
- Don't take too long.

33:01.729 --> 33:07.065
- Don't worry. I won't. I don't have much stuff.
- With us, you're not going to need much.

33:13.174 --> 33:16.405
Just don't forget your toothbrush.

33:28.189 --> 33:33.286
Dear Mom, I guess you're surprised to be
hearing from me so soon after my last letter,

33:33.361 --> 33:38.355
but I've just moved into an apartment
belonging to a famous French author.

33:38.433 --> 33:41.800
His children are the same age as me
and have the same interests.

33:41.869 --> 33:46.431
I know how pleased you'll be to hear
I'm getting in with the right kind of people.

33:46.507 --> 33:49.442
Say hello to Father.
I hope he's not still mad at me...

33:49.744 --> 33:52.042
Listen to this, Matthew.

33:52.113 --> 33:57.312
"The difference between Keaton and Chaplin
is the difference between prose and poetry,

33:57.385 --> 34:02.322
between the aristocrat and the tramp,
between eccentricity and mysticism,

34:02.390 --> 34:06.884
between man as a machine
and man as angel".

34:06.961 --> 34:08.326
Not bad, huh?

34:08.396 --> 34:11.991
That's good. Except, for me,
there's no comparison.

34:12.533 --> 34:16.025
Why? Because Chaplin's incomparable?

34:17.905 --> 34:21.306
No. Because Keaton is incomparable.

34:22.210 --> 34:25.577
Keaton? You think Keaton's
greater than Chaplin?

34:25.646 --> 34:27.705
- Absolutely, I do.
- You're not serious.

34:27.782 --> 34:30.080
- Course I am.
- You're crazy.

34:30.150 --> 34:33.848
Come on. You can't deny
that Keaton's funnier than Chaplin.

34:33.920 --> 34:38.255
- Yes, I can.
- You don't find Keaton funnier than Chaplin?

34:38.326 --> 34:40.590
I don't think anyone's funnier than Chaplin.

34:40.661 --> 34:43.425
Keaton is. Even when he's
not doing anything he's funny.

34:43.498 --> 34:46.433
And he looks like Godard.
Keaton is a real filmmaker.

34:46.501 --> 34:50.369
Chaplin - all he cares about
is his own performance, his own ego.

34:50.438 --> 34:52.303
- Bullshit.
- It's not bullshit.

34:52.373 --> 34:57.333
Yes, it is. Sometimes I think you Americans
understand fuck all about your own culture.

34:57.411 --> 35:02.212
- No wonder you never got Jerry Lewis.
- Don't even get me started on Jerry Lewis.

35:02.283 --> 35:06.447
Listen, Matthew. When Chaplin wanted
to have a beautiful shot, he knew how.

35:06.521 --> 35:09.718
Better than Keaton. Better than anybody.

35:09.791 --> 35:12.089
<i>You remember the last shot of City Lights?</i>

35:12.160 --> 35:16.153
He looks at the flower girl, she looks at him.

35:16.764 --> 35:21.133
And don't forget she's been blind,
so she was seeing him for the very first time.

35:21.202 --> 35:25.536
And it's as if, through her eyes,
we also see him for the very first time.

35:25.606 --> 35:29.007
Charlie Chaplin, Charlot,
the most famous man in the world,

35:29.076 --> 35:32.944
and it's as if
we've never really seen him before.

35:38.619 --> 35:42.715
Isa, if you play that fucking record again,
I'll break it in two. OK?

35:42.790 --> 35:45.384
But you like Janis Joplin.

35:47.628 --> 35:49.061
Stop it.

35:49.130 --> 35:51.826
I said stop it, Isabelle.

35:52.633 --> 35:53.861
Stop!

35:53.935 --> 35:56.802
- Matthew, tell me - what film?
- What?

35:56.871 --> 36:01.535
Name a film where someone tap-dancing
drives someone else crazy.

36:01.609 --> 36:03.770
- I know this.
- Forfeit if you can't answer.

36:03.845 --> 36:07.281
<i>- Quick, quick or you'll pay the forfeit.
- Top Hat. Top Hat.</i>

36:07.348 --> 36:11.375
Fred Astaire is dancing
over Ginger Rogers' room.

36:13.588 --> 36:16.580
And she's mad because he wakes her up.

36:22.530 --> 36:24.327
I'm right.

36:25.766 --> 36:26.892
He's good.

36:26.968 --> 36:29.698
You thinking what I'm thinking?

36:29.770 --> 36:31.203
What?

36:31.272 --> 36:32.864
<i>Bande à part.</i>

36:32.940 --> 36:34.931
You're right.

36:35.142 --> 36:38.407
Why are you two looking at me like that?

36:38.479 --> 36:40.276
Well,

36:40.348 --> 36:42.714
you see, my little Matthew,

36:42.783 --> 36:46.082
there's something Theo and I
have been meaning to do for a long time,

36:46.153 --> 36:49.020
but we've been waiting
for the right person to do it with.

36:49.090 --> 36:51.718
- And I think you're finally it.
- To do what?

36:51.792 --> 36:55.091
<i>- Try to beat the record of Bande à part.
- What record?</i>

36:55.162 --> 36:57.221
<i>- You've seen Bande à part?
- Yeah.</i>

36:57.298 --> 37:01.291
- Where they race through the Louvre?
- Remind me.

37:01.369 --> 37:04.133
To beat the world record
of nine minutes and 45 seconds.

37:04.205 --> 37:07.766
- Oh, yeah. Of course.
- We're going to beat their record.

37:11.212 --> 37:14.204
- What?
- What's the matter?

37:14.615 --> 37:17.345
- Nothing, really.
- Not afraid, are you?

37:17.418 --> 37:21.013
- No. I'm not afraid.
- What, then?

37:21.088 --> 37:24.854
It's easy for you two. I'm an American,
what you French call an "alien".

37:24.926 --> 37:28.157
- So?
- So if I get caught, I get deported.

37:28.229 --> 37:31.426
Don't worry, little man.
We're not going to get caught.

37:31.499 --> 37:34.229
<i>- You don't know that.
- They weren't caught in Bande à part.</i>

37:34.302 --> 37:37.328
- If we beat the record, we won't be caught.
- It's a movie.

37:37.405 --> 37:39.566
Go get Papa's stopwatch. Come on.

37:39.640 --> 37:44.543
- It's a great idea...
- Matthew, this is a test.

37:44.612 --> 37:48.275
Are you going to pass it or fail it?

37:48.349 --> 37:50.112
Be careful.

37:50.184 --> 37:52.914
A lot depends on how you answer.

38:26.087 --> 38:31.115
Nine minutes and 28 seconds.
We beat the record by 17 seconds.

38:33.327 --> 38:36.194
Matthew. My little Matthew.

38:36.263 --> 38:38.754
You were wonderful.

38:42.837 --> 38:45.067
We accept him. One of us.

38:45.239 --> 38:48.436
We accept him. One of us.

38:48.509 --> 38:51.808
One of us. We accept her, we accept her.

38:55.983 --> 38:57.780
We accept him. One of us.

38:57.852 --> 38:58.944
One of us.

39:45.466 --> 39:51.427
We accept you. One of us.
One of us. One of us. One of us. One of us.

39:57.344 --> 39:59.335
That's Mother.

40:01.315 --> 40:03.476
I'm too wet to answer.

40:07.755 --> 40:10.690
Isa's smart, but she doesn't know
how to deal with parents.

40:10.758 --> 40:15.058
- What do you mean?
- I mean, it's not enough to ignore them.

40:15.129 --> 40:19.896
They should all be arrested. Put on trial.

40:19.967 --> 40:22.299
Confess their crimes.

40:22.369 --> 40:28.001
Sent to the country
for self-criticism and re-education.

40:29.243 --> 40:33.873
- They're already in the country.
- They are at the seaside.

40:33.948 --> 40:35.939
That's different.

40:41.589 --> 40:42.954
Too bad.

40:43.023 --> 40:45.583
My parents never go anywhere.

40:45.659 --> 40:49.026
At least you have the house to yourselves.

40:51.098 --> 40:53.623
Where are you going?

40:54.635 --> 41:00.505
- I gotta get out of these clothes.
- It'll be cold in your room. Come into mine.

41:27.935 --> 41:30.836
You can wear this.

41:31.972 --> 41:34.202
Thanks.

41:52.660 --> 41:54.719
I'm going to get a Coca.

41:54.795 --> 41:57.286
- Want one?
- OK.

42:47.214 --> 42:51.514
- Could you open the door? My hands are full.
- Just a second.

42:54.321 --> 42:56.755
- Why didn't you open the door?
- I was...

42:56.824 --> 42:59.156
I was dressing.

43:16.644 --> 43:19.579
What film?

43:25.619 --> 43:28.679
In what film does a chorus line dance like this

43:28.756 --> 43:32.385
with a singer in a fur coat?

43:32.459 --> 43:35.087
- I've seen this film?
- We saw it together.

43:35.162 --> 43:37.255
We did? Give me a clue.

43:37.331 --> 43:40.323
- Certainly not.
- Come on. Be a sport. The director's name.

43:40.401 --> 43:42.266
No.

43:43.304 --> 43:47.035
- Number of words in the title?
- I said no.

43:47.975 --> 43:50.136
The first letter of the first word.

43:50.210 --> 43:52.508
God. You're pathetic.

43:52.579 --> 43:55.605
Isn't he pathetic?
Don't you think he's pathetic?

43:55.683 --> 43:59.847
- Matthew, I bet you know.
- Don't you dare help him.

43:59.920 --> 44:02.684
Did the Sphinx give Oedipus a clue?

44:02.756 --> 44:04.917
Fuck you.

44:06.193 --> 44:08.218
Give up?

44:20.441 --> 44:21.738
<i>Blonde Venus.</i>

44:21.809 --> 44:22.434
Shit...

44:22.509 --> 44:25.137
Marlene Dietrich. 1932.

44:25.212 --> 44:27.874
I knew that.

44:29.016 --> 44:32.474
- Forfeit.
- If you insist.

44:32.553 --> 44:35.113
I dare you to do now,

44:35.189 --> 44:40.752
in front of us,
what I have watched you do in front of her.

44:40.828 --> 44:42.591
Who?

44:42.663 --> 44:47.691
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Oh, yes, you do, my pet.

44:47.768 --> 44:49.167
Forfeit.

44:50.537 --> 44:54.371
What a bitch you are. A bitch and a sadist.

44:54.441 --> 44:57.842
Are you going to pay the forfeit or not?

45:04.051 --> 45:06.212
Very well.

45:14.928 --> 45:20.264
I want you to do it the way you did it
when you thought no one was watching.

47:06.907 --> 47:10.866
Let's have a drink. I'll meet you downstairs.

47:45.279 --> 47:50.080
Why won't you admit you were thrilled?
Come on, you can tell me.

47:51.752 --> 47:53.014
What?

47:53.086 --> 47:56.886
- Weren't you just a tiny bit excited?
- What is it you're trying to get me to say?

47:56.957 --> 47:59.653
Nothing. I asked you a question.

47:59.726 --> 48:03.059
- I suppose you know who you sound like.
- Who?

48:03.130 --> 48:05.963
- Isabelle.
- Why not? She's my twin sister.

48:06.033 --> 48:09.901
- You two are twins?
- Yes. She'd be me if she were a man.

48:09.970 --> 48:15.203
- That's crap. You're not identical.
- Yes, we are. We're Siamese twins.

48:15.275 --> 48:17.300
Joined here.

48:20.547 --> 48:22.742
You're a strange one, Theo.

48:22.816 --> 48:28.049
Half an hour ago, I saw you look at her
as though you wanted to strangle her.

48:28.121 --> 48:30.282
I did.

48:30.357 --> 48:33.520
- I don't understand you.
- Don't you have brothers or sisters?

48:33.594 --> 48:37.325
- I have two older sisters.
- Didn't you ever want to strangle them?

48:37.397 --> 48:41.800
Course I did, but I never masturbated
in front of them, and I never...

48:41.868 --> 48:45.668
They never forced me
to do anything I never wanted to do.

48:47.274 --> 48:50.243
You think Isabelle forced me, do you?

49:01.421 --> 49:05.357
Deep down,
I knew things couldn't go on as before.

49:05.425 --> 49:08.451
Now the stakes had been raised.

49:08.528 --> 49:14.160
But, for a while at least, there did seem to be
a kind of truce between Theo and Isabelle.

49:14.234 --> 49:17.499
And then, one evening...

49:32.319 --> 49:35.482
- What film?
- What film?

49:35.555 --> 49:40.424
Name the film where a cross
marks the spot of a murder or pay the forfeit.

49:43.363 --> 49:46.355
- You too, Matthew.
- Me?

49:46.433 --> 49:49.493
What have I done?

49:49.569 --> 49:52.299
Name the film or pay the forfeit.

49:56.677 --> 50:00.670
- Time's up.
- Time's up? You didn't give me a chance.

50:00.747 --> 50:04.308
<i>- The film?
- Scarface. Howard Hawks.</i>

50:04.384 --> 50:06.875
1932.

50:06.953 --> 50:09.183
And the forfeit?

50:10.190 --> 50:11.680
Well,

50:15.262 --> 50:18.060
as you know, Isabelle, I'm not a sadist.

50:18.131 --> 50:22.295
I just want to see everyone happy.
No one left out.

50:22.369 --> 50:23.700
So,

50:23.770 --> 50:26.136
I'd like you

50:27.140 --> 50:29.700
and Matthew

50:29.776 --> 50:32.244
to make love in front of me.

50:32.312 --> 50:37.045
But not in here. I don't fancy sleeping
in someone else's revolting spunk.

50:37.117 --> 50:40.883
- No offence, Matthew.
- Where?

50:40.954 --> 50:45.550
In the spare room. In front of the Delacroix.

50:45.625 --> 50:49.493
Maybe one reproduction will inspire another.

50:49.563 --> 50:51.929
- I won't do it.
- You won't do it?

50:51.998 --> 50:55.161
- You wouldn't.
- Matthew isn't my type.

52:04.471 --> 52:07.872
I need to go to the bathroom.

53:02.729 --> 53:04.720
This is silly.

53:04.798 --> 53:07.289
Come out of there.

53:19.646 --> 53:21.136
OK. All right.

53:21.214 --> 53:22.806
- Look...
- Too late.

53:22.883 --> 53:27.946
You're hurting me. I don't...
I'm not violent. I'm against violence.

53:28.021 --> 53:31.957
- I'm not gonna resist - look.
- So shut up.

53:33.293 --> 53:37.730
You know, Matthew,
you aren't being very gallant.

53:37.797 --> 53:41.563
Is the prospect
of making love to me so hateful?

53:43.637 --> 53:47.334
I've seen you. I saw you in bed together.

53:48.341 --> 53:51.367
Our guest has been spying on us.

53:51.444 --> 53:54.572
Now, that wasn't
a friendly thing to do, Matthew.

53:54.648 --> 53:58.140
Especially when we've been so hospitable.

54:02.088 --> 54:04.556
I'm not resisting.

54:20.840 --> 54:25.834
How sweet of you, Matthew,
to keep my image next to your heart.

54:25.912 --> 54:28.107
I didn't...

54:36.256 --> 54:38.554
Come on. Wake up.

54:39.559 --> 54:41.049
Come on. Wake up.

54:43.061 --> 54:44.585
Isabelle?

54:44.663 --> 54:47.154
No. I'm Theo.

54:49.334 --> 54:51.495
Where is Isabelle?

55:34.379 --> 55:37.212
You have to help me.

55:57.135 --> 55:58.796
Sorry.

59:50.768 --> 59:53.259
That was the best one.

59:55.273 --> 59:58.003
What about yesterday?

59:58.910 --> 01:00:01.344
In Papa's study.

01:00:01.412 --> 01:00:04.939
You thought that was better?

01:00:05.016 --> 01:00:07.280
Please, please, please, please.

01:00:07.352 --> 01:00:10.014
- What?
- Stay inside.

01:00:12.190 --> 01:00:13.680
Matthew.

01:00:14.659 --> 01:00:17.093
My love.

01:00:17.162 --> 01:00:19.562
My first love.

01:00:20.465 --> 01:00:22.933
My great love.

01:00:23.001 --> 01:00:25.060
My great lover.

01:00:26.070 --> 01:00:28.868
My Valentino.

01:00:28.940 --> 01:00:33.900
My funny Valentino

01:01:01.606 --> 01:01:05.098
You know, I thought you had many lovers.

01:01:07.478 --> 01:01:09.810
When I first saw you at the Cinémathèque -

01:01:09.881 --> 01:01:12.509
you and Theo -

01:01:12.584 --> 01:01:15.314
you looked so cool.

01:01:16.354 --> 01:01:18.879
So sophisticated.

01:01:19.891 --> 01:01:22.189
Like a movie star.

01:01:22.260 --> 01:01:24.626
I was.

01:01:24.696 --> 01:01:26.994
I was acting, Matthew.

01:01:32.503 --> 01:01:34.835
How did you and...

01:01:35.840 --> 01:01:38.832
How did you and Theo...

01:01:38.910 --> 01:01:42.073
come together the way that you are?

01:01:42.146 --> 01:01:44.273
Theo and me?

01:01:45.083 --> 01:01:47.483
It was love at first sight.

01:01:59.664 --> 01:02:02.098
But he's never been inside you?

01:02:02.900 --> 01:02:05.198
He's always inside me.

01:02:10.074 --> 01:02:12.736
What would you do...

01:02:15.013 --> 01:02:18.449
What would you do
if your parents found out?

01:02:18.516 --> 01:02:22.680
- It must never happen.
- Yeah, I know, but...

01:02:24.789 --> 01:02:27.349
what if it did?

01:02:28.559 --> 01:02:31.084
It must never, never happen.

01:02:31.162 --> 01:02:34.928
I understand that,
but let's say that it did happen.

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.400
What would you...

01:02:39.404 --> 01:02:42.134
What would you do?

01:02:47.312 --> 01:02:50.076
I would kill myself.

01:03:08.633 --> 01:03:13.661
- Where are you going?
- The kitchen. I have to get something to eat.

01:03:13.738 --> 01:03:15.899
Good luck.

01:03:50.007 --> 01:03:51.998
- Want some honey?
- No, thank you.

01:03:52.076 --> 01:03:54.010
- It's good.
- No.

01:03:54.078 --> 01:03:56.546
- It's really good. Try some.
- No.

01:03:56.614 --> 01:04:00.948
- Just try a little bit. It's really...
- No. Thank you.

01:04:09.627 --> 01:04:13.063
I want you to know that I'm grateful.

01:04:14.399 --> 01:04:15.957
Grateful?

01:04:17.201 --> 01:04:21.535
Remember what you told me in the café,
about you and Isabelle?

01:04:21.606 --> 01:04:23.801
You were right.

01:04:23.875 --> 01:04:27.208
You know, for me, you two are...

01:04:28.379 --> 01:04:32.213
you're like two halves of the same person.

01:04:32.283 --> 01:04:35.844
Now you've made me feel
like I'm a part of you.

01:04:37.422 --> 01:04:39.413
Both of you.

01:04:42.193 --> 01:04:44.855
Let's get something straight, OK?

01:04:48.900 --> 01:04:51.266
You're a nice boy and I like you a lot,

01:04:51.335 --> 01:04:53.496
but no,

01:04:55.006 --> 01:04:58.464
it wasn't always meant to be the three of us.

01:05:02.146 --> 01:05:05.138
I told you something else, remember?

01:05:06.851 --> 01:05:09.342
That Isa and I are Siamese twins.

01:05:12.690 --> 01:05:15.022
I wasn'tjoking.

01:06:02.707 --> 01:06:04.732
What's this?

01:06:04.809 --> 01:06:08.370
That, my dear brother, is a cheese fondue

01:06:08.446 --> 01:06:12.246
accompanied by a compote
of broccoli and prunes.

01:06:12.316 --> 01:06:15.012
- And this?
- That's ratatouille.

01:06:15.620 --> 01:06:19.716
- And you expect me to eat this muck?
- You expected me to cook it.

01:06:19.790 --> 01:06:23.692
- I prefer to starve.
- You will. There's nothing else in the house.

01:06:23.761 --> 01:06:25.820
Matthew?

01:06:25.897 --> 01:06:28.388
Can I serve you?

01:06:31.235 --> 01:06:33.726
The fondue or the ratatouille?

01:06:35.640 --> 01:06:37.972
Which is which?

01:06:38.042 --> 01:06:41.068
This is fondue, and this is ratatouille.

01:06:41.145 --> 01:06:45.809
No. This is the fondue,
and this is the ratatouille.

01:06:45.883 --> 01:06:48.317
The ratatouille.

01:06:48.386 --> 01:06:49.978
Ratatouille.

01:06:57.428 --> 01:06:59.919
That's fine.

01:07:06.837 --> 01:07:10.466
Eat it as if you were in some
exotic country you've never visited,

01:07:10.541 --> 01:07:12.941
and this is the national dish.

01:07:26.657 --> 01:07:30.423
It looks like he's vomiting in reverse.

01:07:31.529 --> 01:07:33.793
It's horrible, isn't it?

01:07:34.932 --> 01:07:36.991
I'm sorry, Isabelle. I know you tried.

01:07:37.068 --> 01:07:40.902
Thank you, Matthew.
I'm glad somebody appreciates my efforts.

01:07:40.972 --> 01:07:44.373
- There is nothing in the house?
- Nothing you'd want to eat.

01:07:44.442 --> 01:07:46.637
- And we cashed all the checks?
- Yes.

01:07:46.711 --> 01:07:50.272
- So what do we do now?
- I'm going to call Papa.

01:08:13.137 --> 01:08:15.799
The phone is dead.

01:09:04.488 --> 01:09:06.752
What's all this?

01:09:06.823 --> 01:09:09.189
It's lunch.

01:09:11.595 --> 01:09:13.654
A filet mignon?

01:09:18.069 --> 01:09:20.629
Would you like a rump steak?

01:09:21.939 --> 01:09:23.930
Stop it. It's disgusting.

01:09:26.544 --> 01:09:28.375
Look.

01:09:28.446 --> 01:09:30.573
What about this banana?

01:09:30.648 --> 01:09:34.140
- One banana for three of us?
- Yes.

01:09:34.218 --> 01:09:36.310
I'm starving.

01:09:36.386 --> 01:09:39.117
Let me see it.

01:09:39.189 --> 01:09:41.818
- Why?
- Just let me see it.

01:09:49.433 --> 01:09:53.130
- What are you doing?
- Just watch.

01:10:14.792 --> 01:10:17.886
Matthew, you never cease to surprise.

01:10:58.102 --> 01:10:59.501
- OK?
- Fine.

01:10:59.570 --> 01:11:03.028
- Where were you the other night?
- I couldn't make it. Sorry.

01:11:03.107 --> 01:11:05.268
What's up? We hardly see you now.

01:11:05.342 --> 01:11:07.708
- We can't count on you.
- Stop pissing me off.

01:11:07.778 --> 01:11:09.643
You're not with us anymore.

01:11:09.713 --> 01:11:11.613
I am, but it's complicated.

01:11:11.682 --> 01:11:13.013
Why?

01:11:13.083 --> 01:11:16.814
Because! Get off my back.
I can't explain now.

01:11:23.194 --> 01:11:24.752
Loser.

01:11:27.198 --> 01:11:29.189
Wait for me.

01:11:36.774 --> 01:11:38.708
A little souvenir from Nepal.

01:11:38.776 --> 01:11:41.006
Thanks, that's sweet.

01:11:43.547 --> 01:11:44.741
Call me.

01:11:44.815 --> 01:11:46.749
OK, with pleasure.

01:11:48.886 --> 01:11:50.683
See you.

01:11:57.027 --> 01:12:02.294
We hardly left the apartment anymore.
We didn't care if it was day or night.

01:12:02.366 --> 01:12:07.360
It felt as if we were drifting out to sea,
leaving the world far behind us.

01:12:16.313 --> 01:12:18.838
- Too strong for you?
- That was really good.

01:12:18.916 --> 01:12:19.848
- Good?
- Yeah.

01:12:19.917 --> 01:12:23.080
- Again?
- No.

01:12:23.487 --> 01:12:26.183
Clapton is God, Matthew.

01:12:26.257 --> 01:12:31.593
I don't believe in God, but if I did,
he would be a black, left-handed guitarist.

01:12:32.429 --> 01:12:37.731
This is not Chaplin and Keaton.
This is Clapton and Hendrix.

01:12:37.801 --> 01:12:40.201
Clapton reinvented the electric guitar.

01:12:40.271 --> 01:12:43.035
- Clapton reinvented the guitar.
- Believe me.

01:12:43.107 --> 01:12:48.773
Clapton plugs in an electric guitar
and he plays it like an acoustic guitar.

01:12:48.846 --> 01:12:52.976
Hendrix plugs in an electric guitar,
he plays with his teeth.

01:12:57.655 --> 01:13:02.957
There are soldiers in the Vietnam war
right now. Who are they listening to?

01:13:03.027 --> 01:13:05.495
Clapton? No.

01:13:05.562 --> 01:13:08.998
They're listening to Hendrix.
The guy who tells the truth.

01:13:09.066 --> 01:13:14.436
- It's fucked up. It's all fucked up.
- You're talking about soldiers in Vietnam?

01:13:14.505 --> 01:13:18.032
- What are they doing in Vietnam?
- They're at war.

01:13:18.108 --> 01:13:20.406
- What are they doing?
- They're fighting.

01:13:20.477 --> 01:13:23.002
They're killing farmers!

01:13:23.080 --> 01:13:24.479
They're dying, too.

01:13:24.548 --> 01:13:27.244
They're killing children,
they're burning fields!

01:13:27.318 --> 01:13:30.810
They wanna be there?
They wanna die and they wanna kill people?

01:13:30.888 --> 01:13:37.225
- Shouldn't you be in Vietnam? Right now?
- I don't believe in violence.

01:13:37.294 --> 01:13:39.626
Where are you?
Shouldn't you be in Vietnam now?

01:13:39.697 --> 01:13:42.097
I'm lucky. I'm in a university.

01:13:42.166 --> 01:13:47.103
I have friends who aren't in university,
and they're expendable.

01:13:47.171 --> 01:13:49.469
They're expendable. I am fucking lucky.

01:13:49.540 --> 01:13:50.939
They want to be at war.

01:13:51.008 --> 01:13:56.071
Do you think you can say to the government,
"I'm against violence, I don't agree with war"?

01:13:56.146 --> 01:13:59.309
Maybe in France. In America, you have to go.

01:13:59.383 --> 01:14:01.544
If you don't go, you go to jail.

01:14:01.618 --> 01:14:05.213
- How can you judge?
- I prefer to go in jail.

01:14:05.289 --> 01:14:09.350
Instead of killing people, Matthew.
I prefer to go in jail, yeah.

01:14:09.426 --> 01:14:12.190
<i>I read it in Cahiers du cinéma.</i>

01:14:12.262 --> 01:14:15.459
A filmmaker is like a Peeping Tom.

01:14:15.532 --> 01:14:17.557
A voyeur.

01:14:17.634 --> 01:14:20.125
It's as if the camera is...

01:14:21.739 --> 01:14:24.970
the keyhole to your parents' bedroom.

01:14:26.477 --> 01:14:30.709
And you spy on them, and you're disgusting,

01:14:30.781 --> 01:14:33.579
and you feel guilty,

01:14:33.650 --> 01:14:38.212
but you can't look away.

01:14:38.288 --> 01:14:43.783
It makes films like crimes
and directors like criminals.

01:14:46.397 --> 01:14:48.592
It should be illegal.

01:14:48.665 --> 01:14:51.691
- There goes my chance to be a filmmaker.
- Why?

01:14:51.769 --> 01:14:55.432
My parents always
left the bedroom door open.

01:14:57.508 --> 01:15:00.568
You'll have to direct theatre, not cinema.

01:15:00.644 --> 01:15:02.373
Maybe.

01:15:18.529 --> 01:15:21.293
My parents only fucked once in their life.

01:15:21.365 --> 01:15:25.995
That's why we're twins.
They didn't want to make it twice.

01:16:36.240 --> 01:16:38.470
Don't be alarmed, Matthew.

01:16:38.542 --> 01:16:41.272
It's good news.

01:16:41.345 --> 01:16:43.404
It only happens once a month.

01:16:48.952 --> 01:16:52.786
- I love you, Isabelle.
- I love you, too, Matthew.

01:16:52.856 --> 01:16:56.019
Yeah, but I really love you.

01:16:56.093 --> 01:16:59.722
And I really, really love you, too.
We both do, don't we, Theo?

01:16:59.796 --> 01:17:01.627
Yeah.

01:17:01.698 --> 01:17:04.531
That's not what I wanted you to say.

01:17:04.601 --> 01:17:06.899
What do you want us to say?

01:17:06.970 --> 01:17:09.530
I wanted you to say you love me.

01:17:10.541 --> 01:17:13.476
- We just did, Matthew.
- No, you said you love me too.

01:17:13.544 --> 01:17:18.243
I don't want you to say that you love me too,
I want you to say that you love me.

01:17:18.315 --> 01:17:20.681
We love you, we love you, we love you.

01:17:20.751 --> 01:17:25.313
That's not right, either.
You have to say it first.

01:17:25.389 --> 01:17:27.949
We can't, Matthew. You already said it first.

01:17:28.058 --> 01:17:32.859
Why is that?
Why am I always the first to say it?

01:17:32.930 --> 01:17:35.592
Poor Matthew.

01:17:37.801 --> 01:17:40.827
We do love you very much.

01:17:40.904 --> 01:17:45.034
I don't want to be loved very much.
I want to be loved.

01:17:46.176 --> 01:17:48.542
You know, when someone wants it

01:17:48.612 --> 01:17:53.015
there's no such thing as love.
There are only proofs of love.

01:17:55.018 --> 01:17:57.953
Are you ready to give us a proof of your love?

01:18:00.190 --> 01:18:03.091
You want proof of my love?

01:18:08.332 --> 01:18:10.596
Get out of the bath.

01:18:23.213 --> 01:18:25.704
Shaving cream...

01:18:25.782 --> 01:18:28.307
- Razor...
- Thanks.

01:18:28.385 --> 01:18:30.717
- What are you doing?
- What do you think?

01:18:30.787 --> 01:18:32.880
- You're not serious?
- Yes, I am.

01:18:32.956 --> 01:18:36.619
Nothing to worry about.
It's an operation I've performed before.

01:18:36.693 --> 01:18:40.129
- Relax. It grows back.
- You're both fucking crazy.

01:18:40.697 --> 01:18:43.461
- What's the matter?
- You call this "proof of love"?

01:18:43.533 --> 01:18:45.933
Turning me into a freak?
"One of us, one of us".

01:18:46.003 --> 01:18:49.564
It's just a game. It's just a game.

01:18:49.640 --> 01:18:53.406
A game, Isabelle? Game? Think about it.

01:18:53.477 --> 01:18:57.311
Think about it.
Is this something you do to each other?

01:18:57.381 --> 01:19:00.509
You wanna shave my pubic hair?
Want me to be a little boy for you?

01:19:00.584 --> 01:19:06.318
A pre-pubescent Theo at six who you can
play games with and you can touch pee-pee.

01:19:06.390 --> 01:19:11.054
- I'll show you mine. You show me yours.
- Just calm down. We hear you.

01:19:11.128 --> 01:19:13.619
Think about it. Think.

01:19:14.631 --> 01:19:17.759
You sleep in the same bed together.
Every night.

01:19:17.834 --> 01:19:20.735
You bathe together,
you pee in the john together.

01:19:20.804 --> 01:19:23.705
You play these little games.

01:19:23.774 --> 01:19:27.403
I wish you could step out of yourselves
and just look.

01:19:27.477 --> 01:19:30.310
Why? Why are you so cruel?

01:19:30.380 --> 01:19:33.611
- Because I love you.
- You have a strange way of showing it.

01:19:33.684 --> 01:19:36.653
No, I really love you. Both of you.

01:19:36.720 --> 01:19:38.984
And I admire you.

01:19:39.056 --> 01:19:42.856
And I look at you,
and I listen to you, and I think:

01:19:43.860 --> 01:19:49.093
"You're never gonna grow".
You won't grow like this. You won't.

01:19:49.166 --> 01:19:54.263
Not as long as you keep clinging
to each other the way that you do.

01:19:56.273 --> 01:19:59.709
- Isabelle, have you ever been on a date?
- A date?

01:19:59.776 --> 01:20:01.801
- Yeah, a date.
- What kind of date?

01:20:01.878 --> 01:20:04.938
- Have you ever been out with a boy?
- I've been out with Theo.

01:20:05.015 --> 01:20:07.279
Not Theo.

01:20:07.351 --> 01:20:10.343
Have you ever been out
with a boy from school that you liked?

01:20:10.420 --> 01:20:13.253
I was never taken to a school prom,
if that's what you mean.

01:20:13.323 --> 01:20:18.420
- I'm afraid we don't have proms in France.
- You have dates in France, Isabelle.

01:20:18.495 --> 01:20:21.487
Come on. Have you ever been out with a boy?

01:20:21.565 --> 01:20:24.728
Why do you keep asking me that?
You know I haven't.

01:20:24.801 --> 01:20:26.962
Would you like to?

01:20:27.037 --> 01:20:29.403
- Is this an invitation?
- It's an invitation.

01:20:29.473 --> 01:20:34.172
Would you like to go out on a date with me?
Just the two of us.

01:20:34.244 --> 01:20:36.439
Don't look at Theo.

01:20:36.513 --> 01:20:39.482
Isabelle, you don't need his permission.

01:21:13.250 --> 01:21:17.016
No. We can't sit at the front.
We have to sit at the back.

01:21:17.087 --> 01:21:19.988
The front is for people who don't have dates.

01:21:20.056 --> 01:21:22.752
We're on a... Sorry. Excuse me.

01:21:22.826 --> 01:21:28.822
On a date, you always sit at the back.
People sit at the back so they can make out.

01:21:43.079 --> 01:21:45.547
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:21:46.550 --> 01:21:51.749
the motion picture you are about to see
is a story of music.

01:21:51.822 --> 01:21:55.280
I play the role of Tom Miller, an agent,

01:21:55.358 --> 01:21:58.725
a small-time theatrical agent
who had been a...

01:21:59.796 --> 01:22:02.492
Well, you'll see.

01:22:02.566 --> 01:22:06.332
This motion picture was photographed
in the grandeur of CinemaScope,

01:22:06.403 --> 01:22:07.961
and...

01:22:09.306 --> 01:22:12.002
Pardon me.

01:22:25.489 --> 01:22:29.619
Sorry I can't stay, but I have a train on tap.

01:22:30.627 --> 01:22:32.720
All the best, Georgie.

01:22:32.796 --> 01:22:37.597
Can't stand to hear me sing again?

01:22:39.102 --> 01:22:42.071
You know it isn't that.

01:23:55.045 --> 01:23:59.482
When I looked at the TV screen
I remembered the battle of the Cinémathèque.

01:23:59.549 --> 01:24:03.076
Except this time
the demonstrators weren't film buffs.

01:24:03.153 --> 01:24:06.316
They weren't even just students any longer.

01:24:07.824 --> 01:24:12.318
It was hard to figure out what was happening.
It looked like shops had closed their doors,

01:24:12.395 --> 01:24:18.334
factories had gone on strike,
and it was beginning to spread all over Paris.

01:24:19.235 --> 01:24:22.136
We're willing to consider

01:24:22.205 --> 01:24:25.003
all legitimate demands.

01:24:26.443 --> 01:24:30.345
Theo and I never watch television.
We are purists.

01:24:30.413 --> 01:24:32.278
The purest of the pure.

01:24:32.349 --> 01:24:35.341
- Let's go.
- Yeah, but...

01:24:37.253 --> 01:24:38.982
Jesus.

01:25:36.413 --> 01:25:38.881
- What's wrong?
- They're not mine.

01:25:47.490 --> 01:25:50.823
- No. Your room.
- No.

01:25:50.894 --> 01:25:56.764
I don't know how long I've been here,
but in all that time I haven't seen your room.

01:25:56.833 --> 01:25:59.893
- You do have a room, right?
- Yeah, of course I have.

01:25:59.969 --> 01:26:02.164
You don't think I always live in Theo's pigsty?

01:26:02.238 --> 01:26:04.297
How come we never go in there?

01:26:04.374 --> 01:26:07.571
No. No-one's making love on my bed.

01:26:07.644 --> 01:26:08.906
- Please.
- No.

01:26:08.978 --> 01:26:13.642
It's your room. It's part of you.
I wanna see it. Just tonight.

01:26:31.935 --> 01:26:35.496
I discovered a side of Isabelle
I'd never seen before.

01:26:35.572 --> 01:26:38.837
A secret side she hadn't wanted me to see.

01:26:39.909 --> 01:26:43.811
I suddenly thought of
my sisters' bedrooms in San Diego.

01:26:43.880 --> 01:26:48.749
I thought of our house and our neighbors'
houses, all alike with their green lawns,

01:26:48.818 --> 01:26:54.814
and their sprinklers, and their station wagons
parked outside the garage door.

01:27:44.908 --> 01:27:47.138
What sculpture?

01:27:50.547 --> 01:27:54.415
<i>I always wanted to make love
to the Venus de Milo.</i>

01:28:00.490 --> 01:28:04.256
I can't stop you. I've got no arms.

01:28:07.463 --> 01:28:10.227
I can't stop you.

01:28:47.003 --> 01:28:49.995
What's wrong? What's wrong?

01:28:51.274 --> 01:28:53.742
Don't. Don't.

01:28:55.445 --> 01:28:58.471
Don't listen to it.

01:28:58.548 --> 01:29:00.880
Don't cry.

01:29:04.420 --> 01:29:08.413
Please, leave me alone.
Leave me alone. Please.

01:29:09.425 --> 01:29:11.086
Please.

01:29:15.932 --> 01:29:19.265
- Go away!
- Isabelle.

01:29:19.335 --> 01:29:22.168
Theo, open up!

01:29:24.674 --> 01:29:28.075
You're gonna hurt yourself. It's OK.

01:29:28.144 --> 01:29:31.477
- Who are you?
- What? What are you talking about?

01:29:31.547 --> 01:29:34.311
- What are you doing in my room?
- What do you mean...

01:29:34.384 --> 01:29:37.217
Get out! Get out!

01:30:13.156 --> 01:30:15.624
A revolution isn't a gala dinner.

01:30:16.192 --> 01:30:20.424
It cannot be created
like a book, a drawing or a tapestry.

01:30:20.496 --> 01:30:24.762
It cannot unfold with such elegance,
tranquility and delicacy

01:30:24.834 --> 01:30:27.496
or with sweetness, affability, courtesy,

01:30:27.570 --> 01:30:30.539
restraint and generosity.

01:30:30.606 --> 01:30:32.597
A revolution is an uprising,

01:30:32.675 --> 01:30:34.506
a violent act

01:30:34.577 --> 01:30:37.910
by which one class
overthrows another.

01:31:25.828 --> 01:31:29.093
<i>Château Lafite, 1955...</i>

01:31:30.600 --> 01:31:35.435
<i>Château Chasse-Spleen, 1959...</i>

01:31:36.406 --> 01:31:40.706
<i>Grand vin, 1937.
Happy birthday, papa.</i>

01:31:43.312 --> 01:31:45.746
Again?

01:31:45.815 --> 01:31:48.181
Listen, Matthew.

01:31:48.251 --> 01:31:51.618
You're a big movie buff, right?

01:31:51.687 --> 01:31:55.282
Then why don't you think of Mao
as a great director,

01:31:56.292 --> 01:31:58.920
making a movie with a cast of millions?

01:31:59.996 --> 01:32:05.628
All those millions of Red Guards
marching together into the future

01:32:05.701 --> 01:32:08.727
<i>with the Little Red Book in their hands.</i>

01:32:10.006 --> 01:32:12.600
Books, not guns.

01:32:12.675 --> 01:32:14.404
Culture,

01:32:14.477 --> 01:32:16.445
not violence.

01:32:16.512 --> 01:32:20.676
Can't you see what a beautiful,
epic movie that would make?

01:32:21.284 --> 01:32:25.311
I guess, but it's easy to say
"books, not guns".

01:32:25.755 --> 01:32:29.452
But it's not true. It's not books, it's book.

01:32:29.525 --> 01:32:32.255
A book. Just one book.

01:32:32.328 --> 01:32:35.764
- Shut up. You sound just like my father.
- No. Listen to me.

01:32:35.832 --> 01:32:39.734
The Red Guards that you admire,

01:32:39.802 --> 01:32:41.963
they all carry the same book,

01:32:42.038 --> 01:32:47.101
they all sing the same songs,
they all parrot the same slogans.

01:32:47.176 --> 01:32:51.977
So, in this big, epic movie,

01:32:52.048 --> 01:32:55.142
everybody is an extra.

01:32:56.853 --> 01:33:00.050
That's scary to me. That gives me the creeps.

01:33:00.123 --> 01:33:06.528
I'm sorry to say it,
but for me there is a distinct contradiction.

01:33:07.063 --> 01:33:08.894
Why?

01:33:08.965 --> 01:33:15.632
Because if you really believed
what you were saying, you'd be out there.

01:33:15.705 --> 01:33:17.263
Where?

01:33:17.340 --> 01:33:21.106
- Out there, on the street.
- I don't know what you mean.

01:33:21.177 --> 01:33:27.013
Yes, you do. Something's going on out there.
Something that could be really important.

01:33:27.083 --> 01:33:31.918
Something that feels like
things could change. Even I get that.

01:33:31.988 --> 01:33:34.650
But you're not out there.
You're inside with me,

01:33:34.724 --> 01:33:38.285
drinking expensive wine, talking about film,

01:33:38.361 --> 01:33:40.955
talking about Maoism. Why?

01:33:41.030 --> 01:33:42.520
- That's enough.
- Why?

01:33:42.598 --> 01:33:45.192
- That's enough.
- Ask yourself why.

01:33:46.102 --> 01:33:49.663
Because I don't think you really believe it.
I think you buy the lamp,

01:33:49.739 --> 01:33:52.833
and you put up the posters, but it ain't...

01:33:52.909 --> 01:33:57.437
- I don't think you...
- Look, you speak too much.

01:34:00.583 --> 01:34:03.143
Theo, just listen to me. Listen to me.

01:34:03.219 --> 01:34:06.848
I think you prefer...

01:34:06.923 --> 01:34:09.448
I think you prefer when the...

01:34:11.494 --> 01:34:17.364
when the word "together"
means not "a million", just "two".

01:34:19.135 --> 01:34:20.397
Boys, boys.

01:34:20.469 --> 01:34:22.528
Or "three".

01:34:28.177 --> 01:34:31.010
- Come and join us.
- No, thank you, my sweet.

01:34:31.080 --> 01:34:33.105
It smells like a whorehouse.

01:34:33.182 --> 01:34:34.774
Thanks a lot.

01:34:34.850 --> 01:34:37.580
<i>I've got a surprise for you. In the salon.</i>

01:34:45.761 --> 01:34:48.321
I'm getting right in.

01:34:49.565 --> 01:34:53.057
- It's beautiful.
- Come on. Get in.

01:35:01.811 --> 01:35:04.905
We used to do this
when we were little.

01:35:08.117 --> 01:35:10.176
More wine?

01:35:11.754 --> 01:35:13.813
Thank you.

01:35:18.561 --> 01:35:21.121
God, your breath is foul.

01:35:21.197 --> 01:35:24.428
- I'm sorry.
- You're drunk.

01:35:24.500 --> 01:35:26.627
Yes, I'm drunk.

01:35:26.702 --> 01:35:28.602
And you're beautiful.

01:35:28.671 --> 01:35:32.334
And tomorrow morning,
I'll be sober

01:35:32.408 --> 01:35:36.139
but you'll still be beautiful.

01:35:39.548 --> 01:35:41.709
Go to sleep, Matthew.

01:35:46.756 --> 01:35:49.247
Is it time to sleep?

01:35:49.325 --> 01:35:50.417
Idiot.

01:35:50.493 --> 01:35:53.485
You can hardly keep
your eyes open.

01:36:01.003 --> 01:36:03.403
Night-night.

01:36:20.523 --> 01:36:22.514
Wake up.

01:36:24.860 --> 01:36:27.124
What is it?

01:36:27.196 --> 01:36:29.892
I want you to listen.

01:36:29.965 --> 01:36:31.956
- Why?
- Because.

01:36:36.806 --> 01:36:39.969
I love you. You know that?

01:36:40.042 --> 01:36:42.306
I love you too.

01:36:43.312 --> 01:36:46.076
You love me too? That's funny.

01:36:48.617 --> 01:36:51.245
Are you listening?

01:36:51.320 --> 01:36:54.016
It's forever, right?

01:36:55.725 --> 01:36:57.022
What's forever?

01:36:57.093 --> 01:36:59.527
The two of us.

01:36:59.595 --> 01:37:01.529
- Right?
- Yes.

01:37:02.965 --> 01:37:05.399
Why did Matthew say that?

01:37:05.468 --> 01:37:08.164
What did Matthew say?

01:37:08.237 --> 01:37:11.365
That we're monsters, freaks.

01:37:13.576 --> 01:37:17.569
I just want you to tell me
that it's forever.

01:37:17.646 --> 01:37:19.637
It's forever.

01:37:21.150 --> 01:37:22.742
You don't understand.

01:37:22.818 --> 01:37:25.582
We'll talk about it in the morning.

01:37:25.654 --> 01:37:27.645
I promise.

01:39:23.973 --> 01:39:28.376
- Good. We must leave now, darling.
- Already?

01:39:28.444 --> 01:39:31.845
What would you like?
To have dinner with them?

01:39:46.328 --> 01:39:48.819
We must leave on tiptoe.

01:45:13.455 --> 01:45:14.820
What's happening?

01:45:14.890 --> 01:45:19.156
- The street came flying into the room!
- What?

01:45:19.228 --> 01:45:22.197
- What's that smell?
- It's tear gas.

01:45:45.988 --> 01:45:47.512
Hit the streets!

01:45:47.589 --> 01:45:48.521
Go!

01:45:48.590 --> 01:45:50.581
Go on!

01:46:00.602 --> 01:46:03.503
Hit the streets!

01:46:41.743 --> 01:46:45.235
This is just the start,
the fight goes on!

01:47:00.896 --> 01:47:03.091
Theo, this is wrong. This is wrong.

01:47:03.165 --> 01:47:06.191
- This is wonderful, Matthew.
- This is violence.

01:47:06.268 --> 01:47:08.429
It's not violence. Come with me.

01:47:08.503 --> 01:47:10.767
This is fucking fascism in a fucking bottle.

01:47:10.839 --> 01:47:13.137
I'm no fascist! The cops are fascists!

01:47:13.208 --> 01:47:16.769
- Yeah, and police hit people.
- Shut up!

01:47:16.845 --> 01:47:19.313
You can't understand. Leave me be!

01:47:19.381 --> 01:47:23.545
Listen to me for a second, OK?
This is what they do. This is not what we do.

01:47:23.618 --> 01:47:27.782
We use this. We do this.
We use this. We use this.

01:47:27.856 --> 01:47:29.847
Stop it!

01:54:37.886 --> 01:54:41.378
