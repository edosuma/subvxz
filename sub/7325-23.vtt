WEBVTT

00:01.732 --> 00:03.304
(siren wails)

00:03.304 --> 00:05.276
(Meredith) THEY HIT YOU
OUT OF NOWHERE.

00:05.276 --> 00:07.278
(exhales and sniffles)

00:07.278 --> 00:08.609
WHAT HAPPENED?

00:08.609 --> 00:10.511
(sniffling)

00:10.511 --> 00:13.484
(crying) WE WERE ARGUING.

00:13.484 --> 00:16.147
HE KEPT SAYING THAT
HE COULDN'T TRUST ME ANYMORE,

00:16.147 --> 00:17.548
THAT I WAS A LIAR,
THAT I...

00:17.548 --> 00:19.190
(sobs) THAT I LIED
ABOUT HOW I WAS.

00:19.190 --> 00:20.351
HE HIT YOU?

00:20.351 --> 00:23.754
GOD, IT JUST GOT SO BAD.
(continues crying)

00:23.754 --> 00:26.127
WHEN BAD THINGS COME,
THEY COME SUDDENLY,

00:26.127 --> 00:27.428
WITHOUT WARNING.

00:27.428 --> 00:29.130
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN NOW.

00:29.130 --> 00:31.662
NOTHING'S GONNA HAPPEN.

00:31.662 --> 00:34.265
YOU'RE SAFE.

00:34.265 --> 00:36.507
ALL RIGHT?

00:36.507 --> 00:38.109
YOU'RE SAFE HERE.

00:38.109 --> 00:39.240
YOU JUST NEED
TO GET SOME SLEEP.

00:39.240 --> 00:41.472
ALL RIGHT?
JUST TRY AND SLEEP.

00:41.472 --> 00:42.643
MM.

00:42.643 --> 00:43.774
IF YOU NEED ANYTHING...

00:43.774 --> 00:45.146
(jangles keys)

00:45.146 --> 00:46.777
I'LL HAVE MY CELL.

00:46.777 --> 00:48.279
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

00:48.279 --> 00:50.281
WE RARELY GET TO SEE
THE CATASTROPHE COMING...

00:50.281 --> 00:52.683
ALEX,
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?!

00:52.683 --> 00:55.786
(ferry horn honks)

00:55.786 --> 00:58.129
MAKE SURE THAT'S COVERED,
AND MAKE SURE...
(power tools whirring,
hammering)

00:58.129 --> 00:59.260
(lift whirs)

00:59.260 --> 01:00.661
(alert sensor beeping)

01:00.661 --> 01:05.136
NO MATTER HOW WELL WE TRY
TO PREPARE FOR IT.

01:05.136 --> 01:06.837
WHAT IS ALL THIS?

01:06.837 --> 01:08.669
WEATHER REPORT SAYS
A MASSIVE STORM IS COMING.

01:08.669 --> 01:10.501
HURRICANE FORCE WINDS
AND HEAVY RAIN.

01:10.501 --> 01:12.173
THEY SAY
IT'S THREE DAYS OUT.

01:12.173 --> 01:13.474
SO WE HAVE TIME
TO PREPARE, THEN.

01:13.474 --> 01:14.775
EXACTLY.

01:14.775 --> 01:16.577
SO FOR THE E.R.,
WE'RE GONNA NEED TO OVERSTOCK

01:16.577 --> 01:18.109
SUPPLIES
AND BLOOD PRODUCTS.

01:18.109 --> 01:20.181
LET'S GET READY FOR
DOUBLE CAPACITY INTAKES.

01:20.181 --> 01:23.083
THAT MEANS EXTRA BEDS
AND GURNEYS IN THE HALLWAYS.

01:23.083 --> 01:25.386
THIS STORM WILL BRING IN
A LOT OF CAUSALITIES.

01:25.386 --> 01:27.087
WE'RE GONNA NEED TO MAKE ROOM
FOR THEM,

01:27.087 --> 01:28.859
SO LET'S DISCHARGE
ALL PATIENTS THAT CAN BE.

01:28.859 --> 01:30.391
POST-OP AND LONG-TERM PATIENTS

01:30.391 --> 01:32.363
ARE GONNA BE TRANSFERRED
TO SEATTLE PRES FURTHER INLAND.

01:32.363 --> 01:34.265
WE'RE GONNA BRING IN
SUPPLEMENTALS--

01:34.265 --> 01:36.167
WATER, FOOD, MEDS, LIGHTING.

01:36.167 --> 01:37.328
UH, WE'RE GONNA BE CHECKING

01:37.328 --> 01:39.170
AND REFUELING
THE BACKUP GENERATORS.

01:39.170 --> 01:40.871
AS FOR YOU SURGEONS,

01:40.871 --> 01:43.804
PUSH, POSTPONE, OR CANCEL
ALL ELECTIVE PROCEDURES

01:43.804 --> 01:46.277
UNTIL AFTER THIS STORM...

01:46.277 --> 01:47.478
SO WE'RE CANCELING
SURGERIES NOW?

01:47.478 --> 01:49.240
WELL, YOU CAN AFFORD
TO SLOW DOWN A LITTLE BIT.

01:49.240 --> 01:51.142
I'M PREGNANT.
I'M NOT SICK.

01:51.142 --> 01:52.313
YOU'RE VERY PREGNANT.

01:52.313 --> 01:54.315
YOU'RE THREE WEEKS AWAY
FROM YOUR DUE DATE.

01:54.315 --> 01:55.446
SHEPHERD.
YEAH.

01:55.446 --> 01:56.787
I NEED YOUR HELP.
COME WITH ME.

01:56.787 --> 01:59.119
(Owen) THERE WILL BE A LIST
OF AVAILABLE SURGEONS...

01:59.119 --> 02:00.491
SO YOU'VE GOT
YOUR CRANIOFACIAL BABY.

02:00.491 --> 02:01.822
ARE YOU GONNA POSTPONE?

02:01.822 --> 02:03.194
NO, HE SAID ELECTIVE.

02:03.194 --> 02:04.495
THE KID'S GOT HIS BRAIN
ON HIS FACE.

02:04.495 --> 02:06.497
DON'T SNAP. I WAS
JUST WONDERING IF MAYBE--

02:06.497 --> 02:08.128
WELL, WE HAVE THREE DAYS.

02:08.128 --> 02:09.300
MOST IMPORTANTLY,

02:09.300 --> 02:10.431
WE'RE GONNA NEED TO PRINT
HARD COPIES

02:10.431 --> 02:12.132
OF ALL COMPUTERIZED
PATIENT CHARTS

02:12.132 --> 02:13.564
IN CASE OF A POWER LOSS.

02:13.564 --> 02:14.805
(Jackson) ALL OF THEM?

02:14.805 --> 02:16.167
DO WE HAVE TIME TO--

02:16.167 --> 02:17.308
I'LL DO THAT.

02:17.308 --> 02:18.909
BAILEY,
IT'S GOOD TO HAVE YOU BACK.

02:18.909 --> 02:20.741
I'LL PUT YOU
ON THE O.R. ROTATION.

02:20.741 --> 02:22.843
UH, I MEAN I'LL DO
THE CHARTS.

02:22.843 --> 02:25.276
(staff murmuring indistinctly)

02:25.276 --> 02:28.349
FOLKS, THEY'RE SAYING THAT THIS
IS GOING TO BE A BAD ONE,

02:28.349 --> 02:30.551
BUT WE HAVE THREE DAYS
TO PREPARE.

02:30.551 --> 02:33.624
SO LET'S DO IT AND BE READY
WHEN THE STORM HITS.

02:33.624 --> 02:35.326
THANK YOU.

02:35.326 --> 02:37.828
(indistinct conversations)

02:37.828 --> 02:40.331
HOW'S SHE DOING?

02:40.331 --> 02:42.162
SHE FEELS LIKE SHE CAN'T GO
INTO AN O.R.

02:42.162 --> 02:44.235
SHE THINKS SHE'LL KILL
ANYONE SHE TOUCHES.

02:44.235 --> 02:45.896
I-I TRIED TO CONVINCE HER
TO COME DOWN TO L.A. WITH ME,

02:45.896 --> 02:47.268
TAKE SOME TIME OFF,

02:47.268 --> 02:48.439
BUT THEN
WE HEARD ABOUT THE STORM,

02:48.439 --> 02:50.571
AND SHE SAID
SHE HAD TO STAY AND HELP.

02:50.571 --> 02:52.303
ANYTHING I CAN DO?

02:52.303 --> 02:54.305
I WISH THERE WAS,
BUT HONESTLY...

02:54.305 --> 02:55.906
(huffs) ANYONE BUT ME.

02:55.906 --> 02:57.478
I KNOW.

02:57.478 --> 02:59.750
(indistinct conversations
continue)

02:59.750 --> 03:01.512
I BROUGHT HIM IN
A FEW HOURS AGO.

03:01.512 --> 03:02.913
HE HAD A C.T.

03:02.913 --> 03:04.255
I WANTED TO WAIT FOR YOU.

03:04.255 --> 03:05.416
(curtain rings clatter)

03:05.416 --> 03:06.657
YOU GOTTA HELP HIM.

03:06.657 --> 03:10.261
(people speaking indistinctly)

03:10.261 --> 03:13.193
(Alex) IT'S CHEST PECKWELL.
I MEAN, JASON MYERS.

03:13.193 --> 03:14.365
(equipment beeps)

03:14.365 --> 03:16.897
(people continue
speaking indistinctly)

03:16.897 --> 03:20.231
SO BETWEEN REMOVING
THE ENCEPHALOCELE

03:20.231 --> 03:21.872
AND CLOSING UP
THE FACIAL CLEFT...
(beeping)

03:21.872 --> 03:24.204
IT IS GONNA TAKE
MOST OF THE DAY.

03:24.204 --> 03:25.876
YOU GUYS HAVE ANY QUESTIONS?

03:25.876 --> 03:28.208
UH, N-NO.

03:28.208 --> 03:29.340
(speaks indistinctly)
I GUESS NOT.

03:29.340 --> 03:30.511
(man) NO.

03:30.511 --> 03:32.343
I WOULD TELL YOU
NOT TO WORRY,

03:32.343 --> 03:34.745
BUT THAT'S A LOAD OF CRAP.
YOU'LL WORRY.

03:34.745 --> 03:35.986
BUT IF IT HELPS,

03:35.986 --> 03:38.419
I'M NOT WORRIED A BIT.

03:38.419 --> 03:40.291
(coos)
IT DOES HELP.

03:40.291 --> 03:41.852
A LOT. THANK YOU.

03:43.394 --> 03:45.696
SO YOU KNEW EXACTLY
WHAT TO SAY TO HER.

03:45.696 --> 03:47.227
IS THAT A MOM THING?

03:47.227 --> 03:49.300
OH. THE INTERNET TOLD YOU
I WAS A MOM, TOO, HUH?

03:49.300 --> 03:50.561
(chuckles) OH, GOD.
OKAY, ALL RIGHT.

03:50.561 --> 03:51.862
APPARENTLY, I'M SUPER CREEPY

03:51.862 --> 03:53.434
'CAUSE I KNOW EVERYTHING
ABOUT YOU.

03:53.434 --> 03:55.336
WELL, I'M CREEPY, TOO,
BECAUSE THE INTERNET TOLD ME

03:55.336 --> 03:56.637
THAT YOU STUDIED
WITH BUD CLEMENT,

03:56.637 --> 03:58.339
AND I DID A YEAR
UNDER HIM AT HOPKINS.

03:58.339 --> 04:00.541
BUD?
I MEAN, HE'S A GENIUS.

04:00.541 --> 04:01.712
YEAH.
BUT OH, MY GOD...

04:01.712 --> 04:03.374
HIS BREATH. (laughs)
HIS BREATH IS SO BAD.

04:03.374 --> 04:04.545
SOMETHING DIED IN HIM.

04:04.545 --> 04:06.246
IT DID.
MM-HMM.

04:06.246 --> 04:07.548
ALL RIGHT.
WELL, THIS CHANGES EVERYTHING.

04:07.548 --> 04:09.019
I MEAN, IF YOU STUDIED
UNDER CLEMENT,

04:09.019 --> 04:11.021
THEN I'LL HAVE YOU DO
THE CALVARIAL GRAFT

04:11.021 --> 04:12.883
AND I'LL JUST FOCUS
ON THE BIPARTITION.

04:12.883 --> 04:14.385
COOL?
REALLY? YAY.

04:14.385 --> 04:15.886
YEAH, YAY.

04:15.886 --> 04:17.458
(people speaking indistinctly)

04:17.458 --> 04:20.291
DO YOU WANT TO GO GET COFFEE
BEFORE WE START THIS?

04:20.291 --> 04:22.333
UM... UH, Y--UH, YEAH.

04:22.333 --> 04:24.295
YOU KNOW, I HAVE TO GET
SOME STUFF DONE.

04:24.295 --> 04:26.597
MM.
SO I WILL, UM, I'LL MEET YOU--

04:26.597 --> 04:28.299
I'LL MEET YOU UP THERE.
OKAY.

04:28.299 --> 04:29.640
I MEAN,
YOU'RE PROBABLY JUST GONNA GO

04:29.640 --> 04:30.901
CYBER STALK ME SOME MORE, HUH?
(elevator bell dings)

04:30.901 --> 04:32.343
I MIGHT BE.

04:32.343 --> 04:34.905
(laughs) CREEPY.

04:34.905 --> 04:36.977
I UNDERSTAND IT.

04:36.977 --> 04:40.050
IF MY DAD DOESN'T WAKE UP,
I GO LIVE WITH STRANGERS.

04:40.050 --> 04:41.852
HEY, HEY, HEY,
NOT STRANGERS.

04:41.852 --> 04:43.013
A FOSTER FAMILY.

04:43.013 --> 04:44.915
PEOPLE WHO WANT
TO TAKE CARE OF YOU

04:44.915 --> 04:47.718
AND ARE MORE...
MORE PREPARED TO DO THAT

04:47.718 --> 04:50.561
THAN YOUR GRANDMA IS
RIGHT NOW.

04:50.561 --> 04:52.062
WILL THEY PLAY SOCCER?

04:52.062 --> 04:54.064
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

04:54.064 --> 04:55.496
(stool clatters)

04:55.496 --> 04:56.867
(exhales)

04:56.867 --> 04:58.569
I HOPE SO.

04:58.569 --> 05:00.671
WHAT IF THEY DON'T?

05:00.671 --> 05:02.773
WHAT IF THEY'RE LIKE
THE PEOPLE FROM "HARRY POTTER"?

05:02.773 --> 05:05.676
LIKE, GROSS, MEAN,
AND SCARY?

05:05.676 --> 05:08.809
(chuckles) THEY--
THEY WON'T BE, ALL RIGHT?

05:08.809 --> 05:10.841
I PROMISE.

05:10.841 --> 05:14.545
BUT IF MY DAD WAKES UP,
I COULD STAY WITH HIM,

05:14.545 --> 05:15.716
RIGHT?

05:15.716 --> 05:17.317
YEAH, IF HE WAKES UP.

05:17.317 --> 05:18.649
ETHAN,

05:18.649 --> 05:19.990
HONEY.

05:19.990 --> 05:22.453
OH, EAT YOUR YOGURT.

05:24.795 --> 05:27.358
OKAY. WELL,
I'LL SEE YOU, ALL RIGHT?

05:27.358 --> 05:28.799
AND DON'T WORRY.

05:28.799 --> 05:31.061
OKAY.

05:31.061 --> 05:32.403
(people speaking indistinctly)

05:32.403 --> 05:34.334
PAGE ME
IF ANYTHING CHANGES.

05:34.334 --> 05:35.666
OWEN.

05:35.666 --> 05:37.868
NANCY AND I
HAD A CONVERSATION

05:37.868 --> 05:40.411
ABOUT WITHDRAWAL OF CARE.

05:40.411 --> 05:42.373
I DID NOT BRING IT UP.
SHE DID.

05:42.373 --> 05:43.644
SHE WANTED TO KNOW
WHAT THE CHANCES ARE

05:43.644 --> 05:45.115
AFTER NINE DAYS--

05:45.115 --> 05:46.717
IT IS WAY TOO SOON
TO TALK ABOUT PULLING THE PLUG.

05:46.717 --> 05:48.048
AND I TOLD HER

05:48.048 --> 05:49.880
SINCE HE'S GONE EIGHT DAYS
WITHOUT IMPROVEMENT,

05:49.880 --> 05:52.523
THE NEUROLOGICAL DEFICITS
ARE MORE LIKELY PERMANENT.

05:52.523 --> 05:53.654
OF COURSE YOU DID.

05:53.654 --> 05:54.985
I WASN'T GONNA LIE, OWEN.

05:54.985 --> 05:56.857
SHE DOESN'T WANT TO PUT
HER SON THROUGH ANY MORE,

05:56.857 --> 05:58.028
OR HER--

05:58.028 --> 05:59.990
IT'S TOO SOON.

05:59.990 --> 06:02.433
(people continue
speaking indistinctly)

06:02.433 --> 06:05.095
GET ANOTHER HEAD C.T.,
A C.B.C., AND A CHEM PANEL.

06:05.095 --> 06:06.737
WE JUST DREW BLOOD
THIS MORNING.

06:06.737 --> 06:08.138
I KNOW. DO IT AGAIN.

06:08.138 --> 06:09.870
(elevator bell dings)

06:09.870 --> 06:11.572
OH, HEY. HEY.

06:11.572 --> 06:12.743
HEY.
(clicks button)

06:12.743 --> 06:14.705
(doors close)

06:14.705 --> 06:16.777
(exhales)

06:16.777 --> 06:18.749
(motor whirring)

06:18.749 --> 06:20.110
CAN I ASK YOU SOMETHING?

06:20.110 --> 06:22.012
S--YEAH.

06:22.012 --> 06:24.555
WHEN YOU AND DEREK
ADOPTED ZOLA,

06:24.555 --> 06:25.716
HOW DID YOU KNOW?

06:25.716 --> 06:27.057
I MEAN,
HOW DID YOU REALLY KNOW

06:27.057 --> 06:28.419
THAT THAT WAS SOMETHING
YOU WERE GONNA DO?

06:28.419 --> 06:29.920
(ding)
WHY?

06:29.920 --> 06:31.121
ARE YOU THINKING...
(doors open)

06:31.121 --> 06:32.663
YEAH, FORGET IT.

06:32.663 --> 06:35.426
JUST FORGET IT.
(clears throat)

06:35.426 --> 06:37.428
(people speak indistinctly)

06:37.428 --> 06:38.769
CLEAR THE HALLWAYS
FOR COTS.

06:38.769 --> 06:40.100
PEOPLE WILL COME
LOOKING FOR SHELTER.

06:40.100 --> 06:41.532
HOW BAD IS THIS
SUPPOSED TO BE?

06:41.532 --> 06:42.603
HOPE FOR THE BEST,
PREPARE FOR THE WORST, RIGHT?

06:42.603 --> 06:43.774
WHAT DO WE GOT?

06:43.774 --> 06:44.935
39-YEAR-OLD
CONSTRUCTION WORKER.

06:44.935 --> 06:46.106
WIND BLEW HIM OFF A BUILDING.

06:46.106 --> 06:47.438
FELL FOUR STORIES
TO IMPALE HIMSELF

06:47.438 --> 06:48.879
ON THREE BARS
OF STANDING REBAR.

06:48.879 --> 06:50.040
VITALS ARE STABLE.

06:50.040 --> 06:51.011
MINIMAL BLOOD LOSS
ON THE SCENE.

06:51.011 --> 06:52.182
MAINTAINING AIRWAY.

06:52.182 --> 06:53.544
OKAY. LET'S GO.

06:53.544 --> 06:54.715
LET HIS NAME BE BOB.

06:54.715 --> 06:55.886
PLEASE LET HIS NAME
BE BOB.
WHY?

06:55.886 --> 06:57.147
SHISHKA-BOB.

06:57.147 --> 06:58.649
MY NAME'S LEON.

06:58.649 --> 07:00.090
THE PATIENT'S AWAKE
AND RESPONSIVE.

07:00.090 --> 07:03.153
OH, MY GOD.
I'M SO SORRY.

07:03.153 --> 07:04.495
IT'S BAD, HUH?

07:04.495 --> 07:06.096
THIS IS REALLY BAD?
AM I GONNA DIE?

07:06.096 --> 07:07.628
THE FACT THAT WE'RE TALKING
RIGHT NOW, LEON,

07:07.628 --> 07:09.129
MEANS IT'S NOT AS BAD
AS IT COULD BE.

07:09.129 --> 07:10.130
I GUESS SO.

07:10.130 --> 07:12.202
IF THESE BARS
HADN'T CAUGHT ME,

07:12.202 --> 07:13.804
I'D BE A STAIN
ON THE PAVEMENT RIGHT NOW.

07:13.804 --> 07:16.166
THAT'S THE ATTITUDE, LEON.
JUST KEEP THAT UP, OKAY?

07:16.166 --> 07:18.168
LET'S GET HIM TO THE O.R.
AND WE'LL TAKE X-RAYS THERE.

07:18.168 --> 07:19.770
PAGE GREY AND TORRES.

07:19.770 --> 07:21.211
KEPNER, KEPNER.
WHAT?

07:21.211 --> 07:22.573
I'LL TAKE THIS.

07:22.573 --> 07:23.914
WHY? WHY? I CAUGHT IT.

07:23.914 --> 07:25.646
IT'S A BIG CASE,
AND I NEED YOU ON--

07:25.646 --> 07:27.948
YES, IT IS A BIG CASE.
IT'S MY BIG CASE.

07:27.948 --> 07:29.179
HEY, I-I AM ABOUT TO TAKE
MY ORAL BOARDS AGAIN,

07:29.179 --> 07:30.981
AND THIS IS EXACTLY
THE KIND OF CASE

07:30.981 --> 07:32.523
THAT I WANT THEM TO SEE
THAT I CAN HANDLE

07:32.523 --> 07:34.655
BECAUSE I AM GOING TO
CRUSH THEM THIS YEAR.

07:34.655 --> 07:36.186
I NEED YOU ON STORM PREP.

07:36.186 --> 07:37.888
AND YOU ONCE TOLD ME
THAT I SHOULD

07:37.888 --> 07:40.160
STOP BEING AN ADMINISTRATOR
AND START BEING A SURGEON.

07:40.160 --> 07:42.132
AND THAT'S MY HUMAN
SHISH KEBAB.

07:42.132 --> 07:44.134
(sighs) OKAY. ALL RIGHT.
I HEAR YOU.

07:44.134 --> 07:45.496
GO.
THANK YOU.

07:45.496 --> 07:46.837
NOW I WILL CHECK IN ON YOU.

07:46.837 --> 07:48.198
IF THINGS GET HAIRY,
I'M TAGGING YOU OUT.

07:48.198 --> 07:49.670
YOU WON'T HAVE TO!

07:49.670 --> 07:51.642
(woman) NURSE CANO TO E.R.

07:51.642 --> 07:53.604
NURSE SANDY CANO TO E.R.

07:53.604 --> 07:54.775
(curtain rings clatter)

07:54.775 --> 07:56.106
WHAT HAPPENED?

07:56.106 --> 07:57.878
WHAT DOES IT LOOK LIKE?
BROOKS, WHAT DO YOU SEE?

07:57.878 --> 07:59.149
LIKE, SOMEONE
SUPER MESSED HIM UP.

07:59.149 --> 08:00.681
TALK LIKE A DOCTOR.

08:00.681 --> 08:02.553
UM, TEMPORAL BONE FRACTURE

08:02.553 --> 08:04.054
WITH AN EPIDURAL HEMORRHAGE.

08:04.054 --> 08:05.155
HOW SOON DOES THE BLEED
NEED TO BE EVACUATED?

08:05.155 --> 08:07.518
LIKE, YESTERDAY.

08:07.518 --> 08:08.859
YEAH, BOOK AN O.R.

08:08.859 --> 08:10.220
LET'S GET HIM UP THERE.

08:10.220 --> 08:11.792
KAREV,
WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED?

08:11.792 --> 08:13.123
WHO DID THIS?

08:13.123 --> 08:15.065
MAKE SURE HE DOESN'T DIE.

08:15.065 --> 08:18.068
YOU CAN'T LET HIM DIE,
OKAY?

08:18.068 --> 08:31.642
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

08:36.617 --> 08:37.818
THIS ONE'S SITTING
RIGHT NEXT TO THE CAROTID,

08:37.818 --> 08:38.989
BUT IT DOESN'T SEEM
TO HAVE DAMAGED IT.

08:38.989 --> 08:40.250
THIS ONE'S IN THE RIGHT
UPPER QUADRANT.

08:40.250 --> 08:41.652
AND ACCORDING
TO THE ULTRASOUND...
(whooshing)

08:41.652 --> 08:43.223
IT MIGHT HAVE MISSED
THE LIVER.

08:43.223 --> 08:44.755
(Callie) THE ULTRASOUND
ON THIS ONE

08:44.755 --> 08:46.296
SHOWED THE FEMORAL ARTERY
IS INTACT, FOR NOW.

08:46.296 --> 08:48.098
THESE BARS ARE ROUGH METAL.
WHEN WE TAKE THEM OUT,

08:48.098 --> 08:49.930
WE RISK SHREDDING
THE VESSELS.

08:49.930 --> 08:51.201
HE COULD BLEED OUT.

08:51.201 --> 08:52.232
(Knox) DOCTORS, HE'S STARTING
TO LOSE HIS AIRWAY.

08:52.232 --> 08:53.764
I NEED TO INTUBATE.

08:53.764 --> 08:55.065
(April) OKAY, I WANT TO
CUT DOWN THE PROTRUDING BARS

08:55.065 --> 08:56.567
AS CLOSE AS POSSIBLE

08:56.567 --> 08:57.968
TO MINIMIZE THE DAMAGE
WHEN WE PULL THEM OUT.

08:57.968 --> 08:59.009
BONE CUTTER?

08:59.009 --> 09:00.140
MAYBE.

09:00.140 --> 09:02.242
UH, DOUBTFUL.

09:02.242 --> 09:03.614
(grunts) NOPE.

09:03.614 --> 09:04.975
(Leon) 1/2-INCH REBAR.

09:04.975 --> 09:06.747
YOU'RE GONNA WANT
A 4-1/2-INCH ANGLE GRINDER

09:06.747 --> 09:08.118
WITH A CUTOFF WHEEL.

09:08.118 --> 09:09.680
THANK YOU, LEON.

09:09.680 --> 09:10.851
NO WORRIES.

09:10.851 --> 09:14.024
OKAY, RUN. DO NOT WALK.

09:14.024 --> 09:15.926
(shoes squeaking)

09:15.926 --> 09:17.928
CHEST PECKWELL?
JO's CHEST PECKWELL?

09:17.928 --> 09:19.930
KAREV BROUGHT HIM IN
BEAT TO HELL.

09:19.930 --> 09:21.632
HE HAS A BRAIN BLEED.

09:21.632 --> 09:22.963
KAREV BROUGHT HIM IN?

09:22.963 --> 09:24.935
YEAH. I THINK THAT HE'S--
MNH-MNH.

09:24.935 --> 09:27.037
(whirring,
indistinct conversations)

09:27.037 --> 09:28.969
HEY! HEY!

09:28.969 --> 09:30.601
DO YOU HAVE
A 4-1/2-INCH ANGLE GRINDER

09:30.601 --> 09:31.842
WITH A CUTOFF WHEEL?

09:31.842 --> 09:33.243
(chuckles) DR. BAILEY,

09:33.243 --> 09:34.574
I'M THRILLED
THAT YOU'RE BACK

09:34.574 --> 09:35.976
AND HONORED
THAT YOU REQUESTED ME.

09:35.976 --> 09:37.978
I'M VERY EXCITED
TO BE IN YOUR O.R.
(printer whirring)

09:37.978 --> 09:39.910
SO WHAT ARE WE DOING?

09:39.910 --> 09:42.152
PRESS "PRINT,"
GO TO THE PRINTER,

09:42.152 --> 09:45.015
TAKE THE CHART,
COLLATE IT, REPEAT.

09:45.015 --> 09:47.057
WE'RE DOING THIS, THEN?

09:47.057 --> 09:48.959
YOU NEED ME
TO GO OVER IT AGAIN?

09:48.959 --> 09:50.160
(elevator bell dings)

09:50.160 --> 09:52.022
BUT BAILEY TESTED NEGATIVE
FOR STAPH.

09:52.022 --> 09:54.094
AND SHE KNOWS THAT,
BUT SHE DOESN'T FEEL IT.

09:54.094 --> 09:55.265
THIS WAY. THIS WAY.

09:55.265 --> 09:56.627
MURPHY. MURPHY.

09:56.627 --> 09:57.928
WHERE ARE YOU GOING
WITH THAT?

09:57.928 --> 09:59.830
O.R. ONE. KEPNER NEEDS
TO CUT THE EXCESS REBAR

09:59.830 --> 10:01.932
OFF OF SHISKA-BOB--
LEON.

10:01.932 --> 10:03.774
ALL RIGHT.

10:03.774 --> 10:04.935
COME ON.

10:04.935 --> 10:06.076
(ding)
(man grunts) HEY!

10:06.076 --> 10:07.978
WHERE WERE WE, UH...
OH, YEAH, BAILEY.

10:07.978 --> 10:11.812
RIGHT. UH, YEAH, I JUST THINK
THAT SHE NEEDS TO...

10:11.812 --> 10:13.784
UM, ARE YOU THINKING
WHAT I'M THINKING?

10:13.784 --> 10:15.786
YEAH.
YEAH.

10:15.786 --> 10:17.918
(whirring)

10:17.918 --> 10:20.250
WHOA! WHOA! STOP! STOP! STOP!
(Ben) SHUT IT OFF!
SHUT IT OFF!

10:20.250 --> 10:21.952
YOU CAN'T GRIND METAL.
THE ROOM IS FULL OF OXYGEN.

10:21.952 --> 10:23.123
(exhales)
THE GRINDER'S GONNA
GIVE OFF SPARKS.

10:23.123 --> 10:24.324
YOU'LL BLOW UP THE ROOM.

10:24.324 --> 10:25.826
OH, GOD. OKAY.

10:25.826 --> 10:27.127
YEAH, GOOD CALL.

10:27.127 --> 10:29.660
I'VE, UH, BEEN THROUGH
SOMETHING LIKE THIS BEFORE.

10:29.660 --> 10:30.831
AND HOW'D THAT WORK OUT?

10:30.831 --> 10:32.703
NOT GREAT.

10:32.703 --> 10:33.834
(clicks)

10:33.834 --> 10:35.105
(hinges squeak)

10:35.105 --> 10:37.037
OH, YOU'RE EARLY.

10:37.037 --> 10:38.308
SO ARE YOU.

10:38.308 --> 10:39.710
WELL, I KIND OF LIKE
TO OVERSEE THE PREP.

10:39.710 --> 10:41.812
ME, TOO.
FEEL FREE TO JOIN ME,

10:41.812 --> 10:43.273
'CAUSE CLEARLY,
YOU'RE A CONTROL FREAK.

10:43.273 --> 10:44.815
WELL,
NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT

10:44.815 --> 10:46.146
SINCE CLEARLY,
YOU'RE A BIGGER ONE. (laughs)

10:46.146 --> 10:48.418
(laughs)
IT'S EXHAUSTING, ISN'T IT?

10:48.418 --> 10:50.080
GOD, YES.

10:50.080 --> 10:51.782
I'M SURPRISED YOU'RE LETTING ME
DO ANY OF THE RECONSTRUCTION.

10:51.782 --> 10:53.083
I FIGURE, THE MORE PEOPLE
KNOW HOW TO DO THIS,

10:53.083 --> 10:55.025
THE SAFER FOR KIDS
EVERYWHERE.

10:55.025 --> 10:57.427
IT'S KIND OF MY WAY
OF CONTROLLING THE WORLD.

10:57.427 --> 10:59.259
(laughs)
AND THIS WAY, YOU HAVE
SOMETHING TO REMEMBER ME BY.

10:59.259 --> 11:01.732
WELL, EVERY TIME I TUCK A BABY'S
BRAIN BACK INTO HIS SKULL,

11:01.732 --> 11:03.133
I WILL THINK--
(singsongy)
YOU ARE GONNA THINK OF ME.

11:03.133 --> 11:04.334
(normal voice)
THAT'S THE IDEA.

11:04.334 --> 11:05.896
(laughs)

11:05.896 --> 11:07.067
(chuckles)

11:07.067 --> 11:08.098
HERE WE GO, RIGHT?

11:08.098 --> 11:10.040
OH.

11:10.040 --> 11:11.201
HERE WE GO.

11:11.201 --> 11:13.173
THE METAL'S LAYING ON
TWO MAJOR VESSELS.

11:13.173 --> 11:14.975
THEY'LL SHRED IF WE TRY
AND PULL THE ENTIRE BAR THROUGH.

11:14.975 --> 11:16.176
YOU'RE RIGHT.

11:16.176 --> 11:17.377
BUT I'M DAMNED IF I KNOW
HOW TO DO IT, THOUGH.

11:17.377 --> 11:19.049
(Leah) CAN WE TAKE OUT
THE OXYGEN TANKS?

11:19.049 --> 11:20.911
WELL, THE TANKS, YES, BUT THERE
ARE O-2 OUTPUTS IN THE FLOOR,

11:20.911 --> 11:22.412
THERE AND THERE.

11:22.412 --> 11:24.114
I SAY WE TAKE HIM DOWN
TO A PATIENT ROOM,

11:24.114 --> 11:25.285
DO IT THERE.

11:25.285 --> 11:26.456
HE'S ALREADY UNDER ANESTHESIA,

11:26.456 --> 11:27.958
AND HE'S TOO UNSTABLE
TO MOVE.

11:27.958 --> 11:29.189
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.
HOW ABOUT THIS?

11:29.189 --> 11:31.021
GET ALL ADDITIONAL
OXYGEN TANKS OUT.

11:31.021 --> 11:33.924
I MANUALLY HYPERVENTILATE HIM,
GET HIM ON 100% O-2,

11:33.924 --> 11:35.165
AND THEN I SHUT OFF THE VENT.
YOU CUT.

11:35.165 --> 11:37.097
WHEN HE RUNS OUT OF AIR,
YOU STOP,

11:37.097 --> 11:38.398
I HYPERVENTILATE HIM AGAIN.

11:38.398 --> 11:39.770
THAT'LL TAKE FOREVER.

11:39.770 --> 11:41.902
(Owen) AND IT'S STILL RISKY,
BUT...

11:41.902 --> 11:43.203
IT'S OUR BEST SHOT.

11:43.203 --> 11:45.035
ALL RIGHT. JUST GIVE ME
THE GRINDER, AND YOU CAN GO.

11:45.035 --> 11:46.406
ALL RIGHT, KNOX,
YOU CAN GO, TOO. I GOT THIS.

11:46.406 --> 11:47.938
(Owen) THIS IS DANGEROUS WORK,
PEOPLE. SO EVERYBODY OUT.

11:47.938 --> 11:49.439
I'LL STAY.

11:49.439 --> 11:52.082
YOU'LL NEED SOMEONE TO HOLD
THE BAR STEADY WHILE YOU CUT.

11:52.082 --> 11:53.213
AND YOU'LL NEED ME
TO IRRIGATE THE METAL.

11:53.213 --> 11:54.745
THE GRINDER WILL HEAT UP

11:54.745 --> 11:56.086
AND COULD BURN THROUGH
THE VESSELS.

11:56.086 --> 11:58.048
THAT'S... VERY GOOD THINKING.
(clears throat)

11:58.048 --> 12:00.020
THERE MAY BE LIVER DAMAGE.

12:00.020 --> 12:01.892
NO, GREY, NOT YOU.
YOU GO.

12:01.892 --> 12:03.293
BECAUSE I'M PREGNANT?

12:03.293 --> 12:04.855
SHE HAS A KID.

12:04.855 --> 12:06.857
SHE DIDN'T BRING HERS
TO THE O.R. WITH HER TODAY.

12:06.857 --> 12:08.498
HE'S GOT A POINT, GREY.
YOU SHOULD GO.

12:08.498 --> 12:09.860
(Owen) GREY.

12:09.860 --> 12:11.461
GO. THAT'S AN ORDER.

12:11.461 --> 12:12.933
(sighs)

12:12.933 --> 12:15.936
OKAY, LET'S GOWN UP
AND WET DOWN THESE DRAPES.

12:15.936 --> 12:17.007
(people speaking indistinctly)

12:17.007 --> 12:18.338
HEY, WHAT'S GOING ON?

12:18.338 --> 12:20.040
WHY AM I BEING KICKED OUT
OF MY O.R.?

12:20.040 --> 12:21.311
OWEN HUNT JUST KICKED ME
OUT OF MY O.R.

12:21.311 --> 12:22.472
FOR BEING PREGNANT.

12:22.472 --> 12:23.874
HE WHAT?
(man) EXCUSE US.

12:23.874 --> 12:25.315
WELL, THERE WAS A CHANCE
THAT IT COULD EXPLODE,

12:25.315 --> 12:27.117
AND IT'S--IT IS
INCREDIBLY DANGEROUS.

12:27.117 --> 12:29.019
OH, WELL, I'M ON BOARD
WITH THAT, THEN.

12:29.019 --> 12:30.180
CHECK WITH KAREV.

12:30.180 --> 12:31.882
HE BROUGHT IN A FRIEND
WITH A BRAIN BLEED.

12:31.882 --> 12:34.284
GUY WAS BEATEN HALF TO DEATH.
JASON MYERS FROM O.B.

12:34.284 --> 12:35.956
(people continue
speaking indistinctly)

12:35.956 --> 12:38.829
IT'S NOT HIS FRIEND.

12:38.829 --> 12:39.960
(Cristina)
THESE ARE TODAY'S SCANS?
(beeps)

12:39.960 --> 12:41.191
(Steph) WITH SMALLER CUTS,
LIKE YOU ASKED.

12:41.191 --> 12:42.332
WAIT.
(beep)

12:42.332 --> 12:43.433
WHAT IS THAT?

12:43.433 --> 12:44.935
WE HAVE A PROBLEM.

12:44.935 --> 12:46.336
MER, CHECK OUT
THIS HYPERDENSITY.

12:46.336 --> 12:48.799
IS THAT SOMETHING
OR JUST NOISE ON THE FILM?
(beeping)

12:48.799 --> 12:52.903
THAT LOOKS REAL TO ME.
IT'S ALEX.

12:52.903 --> 12:54.374
GET A C.T. ANGIO
AND FIND ME.

12:54.374 --> 12:56.306
I WANT TO LOOK
AT THOSE VESSELS.
OKAY.

12:56.306 --> 12:58.248
ALL RIGHT.
I'LL HYPERVENTILATE HIM.

12:58.248 --> 13:01.051
WHEN WE GET TO 100%,
I'LL SAY GO, YOU CUT.

13:01.051 --> 13:03.053
WE WATCH HIS SATs
DROP TO 90%.

13:03.053 --> 13:04.915
BELOW 90%, THERE COULD BE
TISSUE DAMAGE,

13:04.915 --> 13:06.987
EVEN BRAIN DAMAGE, SO AT 90%,

13:06.987 --> 13:09.219
I'LL SAY STOP
AND I'LL PUMP HIM UP AGAIN.

13:09.219 --> 13:10.390
YOU READY?

13:10.390 --> 13:11.561
(April and Callie) READY.

13:11.561 --> 13:12.923
AND IF ANYBODY SEES
ANY SPARKS,

13:12.923 --> 13:14.124
THEN RUN LIKE HELL,
UNDERSTOOD?

13:14.124 --> 13:15.365
YEAH.

13:15.365 --> 13:16.827
OKAY. (chuckles) OKAY.

13:16.827 --> 13:17.968
(Callie) MM-HMM.

13:17.968 --> 13:19.199
(air whooshes)

13:19.199 --> 13:20.530
(whoosh)

13:20.530 --> 13:21.902
GO.

13:21.902 --> 13:25.235
(whirring)

13:25.235 --> 13:26.476
(rattling)

13:26.476 --> 13:28.178
(April) OH, MY GOD. SPARKS!
WHOA! WHOA! WHOA!

13:28.178 --> 13:30.580
EVERYBODY OKAY?
EVERYBODY ALL RIGHT?

13:30.580 --> 13:33.043
TORRES?

13:33.043 --> 13:35.345
FINE. YEP. LET'S DO THIS.

13:35.345 --> 13:38.348
OKAY, KEPNER, IF YOU'RE SOMEONE
WHO STILL PRAYS, MAYBE--

13:38.348 --> 13:40.050
DEAR LORD,
PLEASE BE WITH US RIGHT NOW.

13:40.050 --> 13:41.922
HELP US SAVE THIS MAN,
HELP US SAVE LEON.

13:41.922 --> 13:44.224
IN YOUR NAME, WE PRAY. AMEN.
AND... GO.

13:44.224 --> 13:47.457
(whirring and rattling)

13:53.203 --> 13:54.364
(clanks)

13:54.364 --> 13:55.535
(Owen) LET'S MOVE
TO THE ABDOMEN.

13:55.535 --> 13:56.907
OKAY.

13:56.907 --> 13:58.568
ALL RIGHT.

13:58.568 --> 14:00.270
ALL RIGHT. GO.

14:00.270 --> 14:02.242
(whirring)

14:02.242 --> 14:04.114
(rattling)
OH, SPARKS!

14:04.114 --> 14:05.075
SPARKS!
OH!

14:05.075 --> 14:06.246
OH, MY--OH! OH!

14:06.246 --> 14:08.248
BEN, LOOK!
OH, GOD! OH, GOD! OH, GOD!

14:08.248 --> 14:09.549
(whirring and rattling
continue)

14:09.549 --> 14:11.421
(Callie) OH!

14:11.421 --> 14:14.184
NO, WE'RE GOOD. WE'RE GOOD.
WE'RE GOOD. GO. GO, GO.
(April) OKAY.

14:14.184 --> 14:16.156
(whirring and rattling)

14:16.156 --> 14:17.487
(Derek) OH, DAMN IT.

14:17.487 --> 14:19.189
THE C.S.F. IS LEAKING.

14:19.189 --> 14:20.560
THIS IS WORSE THAN I THOUGHT.

14:20.560 --> 14:22.062
(sighs) THE CRACK
HAS TORN THE DURA.

14:22.062 --> 14:23.233
IT'S PRETTY GRODY.

14:23.233 --> 14:24.935
"GRODY"
IS NOT A THING WE SAY.

14:24.935 --> 14:26.596
LIST
THE POSSIBLE COMPLICATIONS.

14:26.596 --> 14:29.339
(exhales) UM, DEATH,
THAT'S PRETTY SOLID.

14:29.339 --> 14:32.302
STROKES, RE-CLOTS,
BEING A POTATO,

14:32.302 --> 14:34.874
GOOFINESS, LOOPINESS,
SIMPLETONISM.

14:34.874 --> 14:36.576
BROOKS.

14:36.576 --> 14:40.150
DIFFICULTY WITH SPEECH,
MEMORY, AND VISION.

14:40.150 --> 14:41.651
WHY ARE YOU MAKING ME
TALK SO MUCH TODAY?

14:41.651 --> 14:44.014
BECAUSE YOU'RE WEIRD,
AND IT BUGS ME.

14:44.014 --> 14:46.116
BUT YOU ALSO HAVE
A NATURAL TALENT FOR THIS.

14:46.116 --> 14:48.188
AND THE WEIRDNESS IS THERE
BECAUSE YOU'RE COVERING UP

14:48.188 --> 14:51.221
A REAL LACK OF CONFIDENCE
IN YOUR NATURAL TALENT.

14:51.221 --> 14:53.493
SO NOW IT IS MY JOB
TO MAKE YOU FEEL CONFIDENT

14:53.493 --> 14:55.065
AND LESS WEIRD.

14:55.065 --> 14:56.366
OKAY?

14:56.366 --> 14:57.998
WHATEVER TWISTS
YOUR KNICKERS.

14:57.998 --> 14:59.499
(instrument clinks)

14:59.499 --> 15:01.501
I SAID FIGHT THE GUY.
I DIDN'T MEAN FIGHT THE GUY.

15:01.501 --> 15:03.503
ALEX, THIS KIND OF STUFF
WAS OKAY WHEN WE FIRST MET YOU,

15:03.503 --> 15:04.674
BUT NOW?

15:04.674 --> 15:06.176
NOW YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE
LESS STUPID.

15:06.176 --> 15:08.208
I MEAN, YOU COULD GO TO JAIL,
YOUR WHOLE CAREER--

15:08.208 --> 15:10.240
LOOK, I'M NOT GOING TO JAIL.

15:10.240 --> 15:12.142
HE WAS LIKE THAT
WHEN I FOUND HIM.

15:12.142 --> 15:14.044
THAT'S YOUR STORY?
NO COP IS GONNA BELIEVE YOU.

15:14.044 --> 15:16.086
ALEX, IT'S US.
JUST TELL US.

15:16.086 --> 15:17.217
I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

15:17.217 --> 15:18.548
(Jo) HE DIDN'T DO IT.

15:18.548 --> 15:20.490
HE JUST FOUND HIM.

15:20.490 --> 15:22.022
I DID IT.

15:22.022 --> 15:23.453
(whirring and rattling)

15:23.453 --> 15:25.525
(Ben) 93. 92. 91.
(April) OH...

15:25.525 --> 15:27.127
OH, GOD.
THIS IS TAKING TOO LONG.

15:27.127 --> 15:28.698
WE'VE HAVE TO
GET INTO THE ABDOMEN.

15:28.698 --> 15:30.330
90. HUNT.

15:30.330 --> 15:32.632
(Callie groans)
ALMOST THERE.

15:32.632 --> 15:35.105
ALMOST THERE.
(Callie exhales deeply)

15:35.105 --> 15:37.167
(whirring and rattling
continue)

15:37.167 --> 15:38.538
GO!
(April speaks indistinctly)

15:38.538 --> 15:40.110
OHH.

15:40.110 --> 15:41.711
STOP! NO! NO! NO!
CAN'T TURN IT ON!

15:41.711 --> 15:43.243
DON'T TURN IT ON!
COVER THE BODY!
COVER THE BODY!

15:43.243 --> 15:44.214
FIRE!

15:44.214 --> 15:45.645
88.
HE'S GETTING HYPOXIC.

15:45.645 --> 15:47.477
I GOT THIS.

15:47.477 --> 15:49.179
(April screams)

15:49.179 --> 15:51.051
OHH.
OKAY, OKAY. OKAY, GO.

15:51.051 --> 15:53.023
GOD, GOOD CATCH,
KEPNER.

15:53.023 --> 15:55.155
OKAY, ALL THE BARS ARE CUT.
LET'S SEE WHAT WE'VE GOT.
OH, GOD.

15:55.155 --> 15:56.456
TORRES, YOU GO SCRUB.

15:56.456 --> 15:58.158
KEPNER, GO BACK TO THE E.R.

15:58.158 --> 15:59.159
WHAT?

15:59.159 --> 16:00.630
I NEED YOU PREPPING
FOR THE STORM.

16:00.630 --> 16:02.062
WH--NO, NO, NO, NO.

16:02.062 --> 16:03.233
YOU NEED ANOTHER SURGEON

16:03.233 --> 16:05.265
FOR WHEN WE PULL THE ROD
OUT OF HIS ABDOMEN.

16:05.265 --> 16:07.237
RIGHT, WE'RE GONNA BE
WORKING ON HIS NECK

16:07.237 --> 16:08.268
SO WE HAVE SOME TIME.

16:08.268 --> 16:10.070
SEND IN GREY
OR WHOEVER'S AVAILABLE.

16:10.070 --> 16:12.042
(intercom beeps)
(Richard) Kepner.

16:12.042 --> 16:13.203
I've got it.
I'll find someone.

16:13.203 --> 16:15.075
CHIEF, HE IS MY PATIENT.

16:15.075 --> 16:17.377
I HAVE MADE EVERY SINGLE RIGHT
CALL SINCE HE CAME IN HERE.

16:17.377 --> 16:20.380
AND WHAT, YOU WANT ME TO STOCK
SHELVES LIKE SOME GROCERY CLERK?

16:20.380 --> 16:22.512
I NEED YOU THERE
MORE THAN I NEED YOU HERE.

16:22.512 --> 16:24.214
KEPNER, I'M NOT
GONNA ASK YOU AGAIN.

16:24.214 --> 16:25.985
GO NOW!

16:25.985 --> 16:28.118
(bag hissing)

16:28.118 --> 16:30.420
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

16:30.420 --> 16:32.422
(door opens)

16:32.422 --> 16:35.225
NICE.
MM.

16:35.225 --> 16:37.467
I'M GONNA MARK WHERE
I'M MAKING MY CUTS, ARIZONA.

16:37.467 --> 16:39.169
THEN YOU WILL MARK

16:39.169 --> 16:42.632
A 2x3-CENTIMENTER PIECE
OF THE PARIETAL FOR THE GRAFT.

16:42.632 --> 16:45.575
DR. AVERY, DR. ROBBINS
IS GONNA DO THE CALVARIAL GRAFT,

16:45.575 --> 16:47.737
AND THEN I THOUGHT I WOULD
WALK YOU

16:47.737 --> 16:50.180
THROUGH THE RECONSTRUCTION
OF THE NOSE AND THE LIP.

16:50.180 --> 16:52.382
OH, I'M FINE TO WATCH
THE MASTER AT WORK TODAY.

16:52.382 --> 16:53.713
COME ON, BOSWELL.
IT SOUNDS LIKE

16:53.713 --> 16:55.245
YOU'RE TRYING TO GET US
TO DO ALL THE WORK.

16:55.245 --> 16:57.247
SOUNDS TO ME LIKE AVERY
IS CHICKEN.

16:57.247 --> 17:00.220
NOT WHAT I SAID.
YOU CAME OUT ALL THIS WAY.

17:00.220 --> 17:04.224
WELL, HE CAN RUN A HOSPITAL,
BUT HE'S STILL A BABY SURGEON.

17:04.224 --> 17:05.425
YOU'RE ONE OF
THE GREY SLOAN SEVEN?

17:05.425 --> 17:07.097
IS THAT A THING?

17:07.097 --> 17:08.398
YES, THAT'S A THING.

17:08.398 --> 17:10.160
YOU GUYS ARE LEGEND.

17:10.160 --> 17:11.631
YOU BOUGHT THE HOSPITAL,
SAVED THE STAFF.

17:11.631 --> 17:13.463
WELL, YOU KNOW
US CONTROL FREAKS.

17:13.463 --> 17:14.634
WE TRY TO RUN EVERYTHING.

17:14.634 --> 17:18.208
IT WAS BRAVE.
I COULDN'T HAVE DONE IT.

17:18.208 --> 17:20.440
AND I'M SO IMPRESSED.

17:20.440 --> 17:22.272
AND YOU, SIR,

17:22.272 --> 17:23.743
ARE DOING
THIS RECONSTRUCTION, OKAY?

17:23.743 --> 17:25.115
OKAY.

17:25.115 --> 17:26.276
OKAY.

17:26.276 --> 17:28.348
ARIZONA, ARE YOU READY
TO MARK YOUR GRAFT?

17:28.348 --> 17:30.450
YEAH.
YEAH, LET ME IN.

17:30.450 --> 17:31.621
ALL RIGHT.

17:31.621 --> 17:33.723
COME RIGHT OVER HERE
NEXT TO ME.

17:33.723 --> 17:35.225
HERE,
GO THROUGH THESE AGAIN

17:35.225 --> 17:37.087
AND JUST MAKE SURE
THEY'RE IN ORDER.

17:37.087 --> 17:38.288
(sighs)
DR. BAILEY, IS THERE A REASON

17:38.288 --> 17:39.489
YOU CHOSE ME TO DO THIS?

17:39.489 --> 17:40.830
BECAUSE YOU'RE AN INTERN.

17:40.830 --> 17:42.192
A SURGICAL INTERN,

17:42.192 --> 17:44.134
AT A HOSPITAL,
NOT A KINKO'S.

17:44.134 --> 17:45.295
(telephone rings)

17:45.295 --> 17:48.168
(sighs) JUST...
SINCE DR. SHEPHERD

17:48.168 --> 17:49.499
KICKED ME OFF HIS SERVICE,

17:49.499 --> 17:52.342
I WORRY THAT EVERYONE THINKS
I'M A LOSING BET.

17:52.342 --> 17:53.843
AND IF THAT'S
WHAT PEOPLE THINK--

17:53.843 --> 17:56.106
DO YOU WANT TO BE RESPONSIBLE
FOR KILLING A PATIENT, ROSS?

17:56.106 --> 17:57.507
IF THE POWER GOES OUT

17:57.507 --> 18:00.850
AND WE LOSE ACCESS TO
A PATIENT'S ELECTRONIC FILES

18:00.850 --> 18:02.812
AND WE REACH FOR HER CHART
IN THIS PILE

18:02.812 --> 18:04.154
AND IT'S NOT THERE,

18:04.154 --> 18:05.485
WHAT WILL HAPPEN?

18:05.485 --> 18:07.287
WELL, THAT'S PRETTY
HYPOTHETICAL--

18:07.287 --> 18:09.659
THE PATIENT WOULD DIE, ROSS,
AND IT WOULD BE YOUR FAULT.

18:09.659 --> 18:10.820
AND HOW WOULD YOU FEEL?

18:10.820 --> 18:12.162
I--

18:12.162 --> 18:13.763
HOW WOULD YOU FEEL?

18:13.763 --> 18:15.195
UH, BAILEY.

18:15.195 --> 18:16.526
HUNT NEEDS ANOTHER HAND
IN THE O.R.

18:16.526 --> 18:18.528
ASKED FOR YOU TO SCRUB IN.

18:18.528 --> 18:20.130
UH, TELL HIM I CAN'T.

18:20.130 --> 18:21.371
STORM'S COMING.
THIS NEEDS TO GET DONE.

18:21.371 --> 18:22.532
BAILEY.

18:22.532 --> 18:24.504
I'M IN THE MIDDLE OF
THE BACKUP CHARTS.

18:24.504 --> 18:26.676
IF I STOP,
I'LL LOSE THE ORDER.

18:26.676 --> 18:28.738
HE NEEDS TO GET SOMEONE ELSE.
I'LL GO.

18:28.738 --> 18:31.441
I'LL DO IT MYSELF.

18:31.441 --> 18:33.683
MM.

18:33.683 --> 18:35.285
(people speaking indistinctly)

18:35.285 --> 18:36.686
OF COURSE YOU WILL.

18:36.686 --> 18:38.148
(telephone rings)

18:38.148 --> 18:40.420
WE WERE HAVING A FIGHT.
HE--HE GRABBED MY ARM.

18:40.420 --> 18:41.751
I FOUGHT HIM OFF.

18:41.751 --> 18:43.293
IT JUST--IT GOT UGLY.

18:43.293 --> 18:45.124
HE FELL BACKWARDS AND HE HIT
HIS HEAD ON THE FIREPLACE,

18:45.124 --> 18:46.626
BUT HE WAS STILL YELLING
WHEN I LEFT.

18:46.626 --> 18:48.458
HE WAS FINE. I SWEAR.

18:48.458 --> 18:49.859
ALL RIGHT, YOU GOTTA GO. GO.

18:49.859 --> 18:51.531
UH, NO, SHE HAS TO EXPLAIN
TO THEM WHAT HAPPENED.

18:51.531 --> 18:53.733
NO, NOBODY DOES ANYTHING
UNTIL WE SEE HOW PECKWELL IS.

18:53.733 --> 18:55.265
LOOK, GO HOME.

18:55.265 --> 18:56.436
DON'T LET ANYONE SEE YOU.

18:56.436 --> 18:58.137
YOU TWO DON'T SAY A WORD
TO ANYBODY

18:58.137 --> 18:59.469
UNTIL WE KNOW
EXACTLY WHAT'S GOING ON.

18:59.469 --> 19:01.841
UNDERSTAND?

19:01.841 --> 19:03.513
HEY.

19:03.513 --> 19:05.575
ARE YOU OKAY?

19:05.575 --> 19:07.177
SHE'S OKAY.

19:07.177 --> 19:08.748
YOU NEVER SAW HER. WHAT?

19:08.748 --> 19:10.780
I HAVE PAUL DAWSON'S
C.T. ANGIO RESULTS.

19:10.780 --> 19:12.522
GREAT.

19:12.522 --> 19:13.683
GO.

19:13.683 --> 19:14.924
(sighs)

19:17.687 --> 19:21.291
DON'T DO ANYTHING STUPID.

19:21.291 --> 19:22.662
(door closes)

19:22.662 --> 19:24.234
(people speaking indistinctly))

19:24.234 --> 19:25.665
(sighs)

19:25.665 --> 19:26.796
OH, IS THAT CHEST PECKWELL?

19:26.796 --> 19:28.167
H-HOW IS HE?

19:28.167 --> 19:29.168
OH, A BAD BLEED.

19:29.168 --> 19:30.700
WE WON'T KNOW MORE
UNTIL HE WAKES.

19:30.700 --> 19:32.242
WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED?

19:32.242 --> 19:34.204
I DON'T KNOW.
UM, I NEED YOUR HELP.

19:34.204 --> 19:35.905
PEOPLE KEEP SAYING THAT
TO ME TODAY.

19:35.905 --> 19:37.807
I FOUND THAT
ON PAUL DAWSON'S SCAN.

19:37.807 --> 19:39.749
COULD THAT BE A CLOT
THAT WE MISSED?

19:39.749 --> 19:41.681
YEAH, THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT IT IS.

19:41.681 --> 19:43.913
IT'S BLOCKING BLOOD FLOW
TO THE BASILAR ARTERY.

19:43.913 --> 19:45.455
BROOKS...

19:45.455 --> 19:46.816
WHY WOULD WE MISS THAT?

19:46.816 --> 19:47.917
OH, I'M NOT ASKING HER.

19:47.917 --> 19:49.489
YEAH, SHE'S--
SHE'S ASKING YOU.

19:49.489 --> 19:50.660
AND I'M ASKING YOU.

19:50.660 --> 19:52.462
(sighs)

19:52.462 --> 19:54.494
BECAUSE IT'S A THROMBUS...

19:54.494 --> 19:56.366
MM.
WHICH IS HARDER TO SEE.

19:56.366 --> 19:58.828
IT'S MORE COMMON TO FIND
A BLEED OR AN INFARCT.

19:58.828 --> 20:00.199
YOU WERE LOOKING
FOR THE WRONG THING.

20:00.199 --> 20:02.502
NICE JOB.

20:02.502 --> 20:04.504
COULD YOU TAKE IT OUT,
LIKE NOW?

20:04.504 --> 20:05.875
RUN A PIPELINE STENT

20:05.875 --> 20:07.707
AND RESTORE THE BLOOD FLOW
TO THE BASILAR?

20:07.707 --> 20:09.279
I MEAN,
COULD THAT WAKE HIM UP?

20:09.279 --> 20:10.610
IT COULD.

20:10.610 --> 20:11.941
IT COULD ALSO KILL HIM.

20:11.941 --> 20:13.483
DOES THE FAMILY
WANT TO TAKE THAT RISK?

20:13.483 --> 20:15.915
BUT, UM, YOU--YOU SAID
THAT YESTERDAY.

20:15.915 --> 20:18.788
YOU SAID IT--
IT WAS OUR LAST CHANCE.

20:18.788 --> 20:21.321
THIS IS...
A LONG SHOT.

20:21.321 --> 20:22.792
OH.

20:22.792 --> 20:25.224
WELL, WHAT DOES
DR. HUNT SAY?

20:25.224 --> 20:28.458
DR. HUNT IS IN SURGERY,
AND PAUL IS MY PATIENT.

20:28.458 --> 20:29.929
AND IT'S YOUR DECISION.

20:29.929 --> 20:33.333
(people speaking indistinctly)

20:33.333 --> 20:35.305
NANCY,
EVERY SECOND COUNTS NOW.

20:35.305 --> 20:38.338
(crying) WELL,
IF THERE'S A CHANCE THAT...

20:38.338 --> 20:39.669
OKAY. OKAY.

20:39.669 --> 20:41.010
(woman) DR. MAHONEY
TO THE E.R.

20:41.010 --> 20:42.542
DR. MAHONEY TO THE E.R.

20:42.542 --> 20:46.245
WOCKA, WOCKA, WOCKA, WOCKA,
WOCKA, WOCKA, WOCKA, WOCKA,

20:46.245 --> 20:47.347
WOCKA, WOCKA, WOCKA,
WOCKA, WOCKA--

20:47.347 --> 20:48.678
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

20:48.678 --> 20:51.321
SORRY. IT'S PAC-MAN.

20:51.321 --> 20:52.452
BECAUSE IT LOOKS
LIKE PAC-MAN.

20:52.452 --> 20:54.854
NOW WHAT DO WE NEED
TO WATCH OUT FOR?

20:54.854 --> 20:56.456
MM. DISLODGING THE CLOT.

20:56.456 --> 20:58.588
MM-HMM.
JAMMING THE STENT, OR--

20:58.588 --> 21:00.360
(monitor beeping erratically)
OH, DAMN IT.

21:00.360 --> 21:01.531
THE BASILAR WALL
IS DISSECTING.

21:01.531 --> 21:02.932
IT'S JUST TOO WEAK.

21:02.932 --> 21:05.034
IF YOU DON'T PLACE THE STENT,
IT COULD RUPTURE, RIGHT?

21:05.034 --> 21:06.366
YEAH. IF WE PLACE IT
TOO FAST--

21:06.366 --> 21:07.867
YOU RISK RIPPING
THE ARTERY IN HALF.

21:07.867 --> 21:09.369
EITHER WAY, HE'S--
HE'S DEAD.

21:09.369 --> 21:10.770
GOOD. YEAH.
JUST BE QUIET.

21:10.770 --> 21:12.672
(beeping continues)

21:12.672 --> 21:14.644
(woman) DR. KENT
TO NEONATAL I.C.U.

21:14.644 --> 21:17.276
DR. KENT TO NEONATAL I.C.U.

21:17.276 --> 21:18.748
HEY, WILSON.

21:18.748 --> 21:20.650
I'M GOING, I SWEAR.
I JUST HAD TO GRAB SOME CLOTHES.

21:20.650 --> 21:21.981
LOOK...
(door closes)

21:21.981 --> 21:23.853
I'M SORRY.
I DIDN'T MEAN TO HURT JASON.

21:23.853 --> 21:25.955
I WAS JUST TRYING
TO GET AWAY FROM HIM.

21:25.955 --> 21:28.558
AND I LOST IT.
I JUST LOST IT.

21:28.558 --> 21:30.059
I LIKE YOU.

21:30.059 --> 21:31.561
BUT I LOVE ALEX.

21:31.561 --> 21:33.363
I DON'T KNOW
IF HE'S DUMB ENOUGH

21:33.363 --> 21:35.425
OR LOYAL ENOUGH
TO TAKE THE FALL FOR YOU,

21:35.425 --> 21:37.727
BUT HE JUST MIGHT BE.

21:37.727 --> 21:40.730
I'D NEVER LET HIM DO THAT.
I WOULDN'T.

21:40.730 --> 21:42.572
OKAY.

21:42.572 --> 21:44.834
(door opens)

21:44.834 --> 21:47.036
(sighs)

21:47.036 --> 21:48.578
HEY.

21:48.578 --> 21:50.340
ARE THEY DONE WITH THAT
IN THE O.R.?

21:50.340 --> 21:52.041
YEAH, THEY WERE DONE
A WHILE AGO.

21:52.041 --> 21:53.843
(door closes)
(clenched teeth) THEN WHY
AREN'T I BACK UP THERE?

21:53.843 --> 21:55.515
UH, I-I DON'T KNOW.

21:55.515 --> 21:57.647
AH! OH!

21:57.647 --> 21:59.389
OHH!

21:59.389 --> 22:02.392
(panting)

22:05.655 --> 22:07.997
(whispers) HELP.
HELP ME.

22:07.997 --> 22:10.630
(blows air) OKAY.

22:10.630 --> 22:12.101
(crying) OKAY.

22:12.101 --> 22:14.333
OKAY.

22:14.333 --> 22:16.606
(continues crying)

22:21.911 --> 22:23.843
(Derek) DISSECTING IS STOPPED.
STENT IS IN PLACE. GOOD.

22:23.843 --> 22:25.915
ANY LEAKS?

22:25.915 --> 22:27.076
I'M... NOT SURE.

22:27.076 --> 22:28.678
YES OR NO, BROOKS.

22:28.678 --> 22:30.049
CONFIDENCE.

22:30.049 --> 22:32.452
NO, SIR. NO LEAKS.

22:32.452 --> 22:33.953
GOOD.

22:33.953 --> 22:35.385
DR. SHEPHERD,
YOU HAVE A MESSAGE.

22:35.385 --> 22:36.686
YEAH, NOT NOW.
IT'S FROM DR. GREY.

22:36.686 --> 22:39.589
SHE TOOK A FALL ON THE STAIRS.
SHE SAYS SHE'S OKAY,

22:39.589 --> 22:40.730
BUT SHE'S GOING TO O.B.
TO GET CHECKED.

22:40.730 --> 22:42.632
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

22:42.632 --> 22:43.793
(exhales)

22:43.793 --> 22:44.964
I CAN FINISH.
YOU SHOULD GO.

22:44.964 --> 22:46.596
NO, YOU CAN'T.
YOU'RE DONE.

22:46.596 --> 22:48.367
HARD PART'S OVER. I'LL JUST,
UH, RETRACT THE SHEATH,

22:48.367 --> 22:51.070
HOLD PRESSURE
ON THE FEMORAL ARTERIOTOMY,

22:51.070 --> 22:52.402
DONE.

22:52.402 --> 22:54.043
I CAN DO IT. GO.

22:54.043 --> 22:55.975
OKAY.

22:55.975 --> 22:57.807
HERE.

22:57.807 --> 22:59.609
WHAT?
(door opens)

22:59.609 --> 23:01.150
OH! OH, NO! OH, NO.

23:01.150 --> 23:02.652
NO, MOUSEY.

23:02.652 --> 23:03.953
MOUSEY, NO.
(pounding continues)

23:03.953 --> 23:06.085
NO, DON'T TOUCH HER.
MOUSEY, NO!

23:06.085 --> 23:07.487
BAILEY JUST SAID NO?

23:07.487 --> 23:10.790
MM-HMM. MIGHT BE 'CAUSE
IT WAS ME WHO ASKED HER.

23:10.790 --> 23:12.822
(Ben) NO, I'M TELLING YOU,
SHE'S JUST A LITTLE SHAKEN UP.

23:12.822 --> 23:14.123
SHE NEEDS A BREAK.

23:14.123 --> 23:16.466
YOU KNOW, CHRISTINA WENT
THROUGH SOMETHING SIMILAR,

23:16.466 --> 23:17.927
SO I GET IT.

23:17.927 --> 23:19.128
HOW ABOUT YOU PULL OUT
THE BAR,

23:19.128 --> 23:20.399
AND I'LL JUMP IN
AND CATCH THE BLEEDERS?

23:20.399 --> 23:21.971
GOT IT.

23:21.971 --> 23:23.132
TORRES, A HAND HERE.
HMM? YEP.

23:23.132 --> 23:24.403
OKAY.

23:24.403 --> 23:26.105
YOU KNOW IT WAS THE SAME
WITH ARIZONA.

23:26.105 --> 23:27.537
YOU CAN'T RUSH HER
BACK TO WORK.

23:27.537 --> 23:29.138
MM, THAT MIGHT BE TRUE...
FOR THEM.

23:29.138 --> 23:33.042
FORGIVE ME, BEN,
BUT WITH SOMEONE LIKE BAILEY--

23:33.042 --> 23:36.616
SOMETIMES YOU JUST NEED TO
RIP OFF THE BAND-AID.

23:36.616 --> 23:38.147
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

23:38.147 --> 23:39.088
HERE WE GO.

23:39.088 --> 23:43.092
(squishing)

23:43.092 --> 23:45.094
(grunts)

23:45.094 --> 23:46.756
OKAY. LET'S GO.
YEAH. GOTCHA.

23:46.756 --> 23:47.997
(bar clatters)

23:47.997 --> 23:49.799
THAT IS A HANDSOME FACE.

23:49.799 --> 23:51.561
MM, VERY HANDSOME.

23:51.561 --> 23:53.132
I COULDN'T HAVE DONE IT
ANY BETTER MYSELF.

23:53.132 --> 23:55.164
WELL, I WOULDN'T HAVE
DONE IT AT ALL.

23:55.164 --> 23:56.135
THANK YOU.
THIS WAS INCREDIBLE.

23:56.135 --> 23:58.137
OH, IT WAS MY PLEASURE.

23:58.137 --> 24:00.670
NOW MY DOWNFALL AS A SURGEON

24:00.670 --> 24:03.442
IS A VERY TINY BLADDER,
SO YOU GUYS HAVE THIS.

24:03.442 --> 24:07.216
I'LL SEE YOU
IN JUST A SECOND.

24:07.216 --> 24:09.779
SHE IS JUST ONE
OF THOSE PEOPLE, ISN'T SHE?
(doors open)

24:09.779 --> 24:11.450
WHAT? WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

24:11.450 --> 24:12.782
ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE

24:12.782 --> 24:13.883
THAT JUST MAKE YOU FEEL LIKE
YOU'RE CAPABLE OF ANYTHING.

24:13.883 --> 24:15.224
SLOAN WAS LIKE THAT.

24:15.224 --> 24:17.026
HE JUST SORT OF TOOK FOR GRANTED
THAT YOU WERE GREAT...

24:17.026 --> 24:18.788
(door closes)
SO THAT YOU'D BE GREAT.

24:18.788 --> 24:20.059
I WISH SHE COULD STICK AROUND
A LITTLE LONGER.

24:20.059 --> 24:23.833
I JUST--I HAVE NOT FELT
LIKE THIS IN A LONG TIME.

24:23.833 --> 24:26.235
YEAH.

24:26.235 --> 24:27.697
(whooshing)

24:27.697 --> 24:29.168
THE BABY'S FINE.

24:29.168 --> 24:30.239
DEFINE "FINE."

24:30.239 --> 24:32.241
AND FEEL FREE
TO TALK LIKE A DOCTOR.

24:32.241 --> 24:35.474
FINE MEANS ZERO SIGN
OF PLACENTAL ABRUPTION

24:35.474 --> 24:37.176
OR ANY INJURY TO THE FETUS.

24:37.176 --> 24:38.778
NO BLEEDING,
NO UTERINE RUPTURE.

24:38.778 --> 24:41.080
HIS HEART BEAT'S GREAT.
NO DISTRESS.

24:41.080 --> 24:43.553
EVERYTHING IS WHERE
IT SHOULD BE.

24:43.553 --> 24:45.955
YOU ARE INCREDIBLY LUCKY.

24:45.955 --> 24:47.657
ARE YOU IN ANY PAIN?
(gloves snap)

24:47.657 --> 24:49.188
NO. UH, JUST--JUST SORE.

24:49.188 --> 24:51.721
IF YOU START TO FEEL
ANY PAIN AT ALL,

24:51.721 --> 24:52.822
YOU KNOW WHERE I AM.

24:52.822 --> 24:53.993
THANK YOU, CONNIE.

24:53.993 --> 24:55.795
SEE, I TOLD YOU,
YOU NEED TO SLOW DOWN.

24:55.795 --> 24:57.997
YOU KNOW HOW WE COULD HAVE
AVOIDED THIS?

24:57.997 --> 25:00.269
IF I'D BEEN SAFELY
IN THAT EXPLODING O.R.,

25:00.269 --> 25:01.831
WHERE I SHOULD HAVE BEEN.

25:01.831 --> 25:04.073
PUT YOUR PANTS ON.

25:04.073 --> 25:05.975
(indistinct conversations)

25:05.975 --> 25:07.877
HEY.

25:07.877 --> 25:10.239
I JUST CLOSED
A MIDLINE FACIAL CLEFT.

25:10.239 --> 25:12.081
PRIMARY SURGEON.

25:12.081 --> 25:13.683
WHAT IS WRONG?

25:13.683 --> 25:15.915
I DON'T KNOW.

25:15.915 --> 25:18.247
HUNT IS ACTIVELY
KEEPING ME FROM SURGERIES.

25:18.247 --> 25:20.590
I DON'T KNOW IF HE THINKS THAT
I'M GONNA FAIL MY BOARDS AGAIN,

25:20.590 --> 25:21.991
OR MAYBE
HE'S JUST FINALLY REALIZED

25:21.991 --> 25:23.823
THAT I'D MAKE A BETTER SECRETARY
THAN A SURGEON.

25:23.823 --> 25:25.695
SO I'LL TALK TO HIM.
NO.

25:25.695 --> 25:27.997
DON'T. DON'T. I DON'T--I DON'T
WANT YOU TO FIGHT FOR ME.

25:27.997 --> 25:29.699
DR. KEPNER,
TRAUMA'S COMING IN.

25:29.699 --> 25:31.761
GREAT. (sighs)

25:31.761 --> 25:34.263
SOMETHING ELSE I CAN GET
KICKED OFF OF.

25:34.263 --> 25:35.665
(Alex) DID THEY RUN A C.B.C.
AND A K.B. STAIN?

25:35.665 --> 25:37.867
YES, THEY RAN ALL THE TESTS.
THE BABY IS FINE.

25:37.867 --> 25:39.208
YEAH, WELL, WHAT ABOUT YOU?
I MEAN, WHY DID YOU FALL?

25:39.208 --> 25:40.640
ARE YOU DIZZY?

25:40.640 --> 25:42.872
I FELL BECAUSE I HAVE
THE SAME CENTER OF GRAVITY

25:42.872 --> 25:45.915
AS A JERSEY COW.
I'M FINE, GUYS.

25:45.915 --> 25:48.117
DOCTORS, IT'S TIME.
IT'S HAPPENING.

25:48.117 --> 25:49.649
COME ON.

25:49.649 --> 25:51.150
(man) COME ON. HURRY.
BEFORE IT STARTS.

25:51.150 --> 25:52.752
WHAT DO WE GOT?

25:52.752 --> 25:54.584
A 48-YEAR-OLD MALE COMPLAINING
OF TIGHTNESS IN HIS CHEST.

25:54.584 --> 25:56.325
HE SAYS HE FEELS LIKE
HIS HEART IS GONNA BURST.

25:56.325 --> 25:58.858
ALL RIGHT, SIR, WE'RE GONNA
TAKE CARE OF YOU, OKAY?
(coughs)

25:58.858 --> 26:00.229

26:00.229 --> 26:01.230

26:01.230 --> 26:04.093

A HEAD INJURY INVOLVED?

THIS IS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL

27:56.906 --> 27:59.448

27:59.448 --> 28:03.983
YEAH, WELL, NO, I-I KNEW...

28:03.983 --> 28:05.715
THAT I WAS GONNA FALL

28:43.392 --> 28:44.924
(cheering continues)

28:44.924 --> 28:46.255
(woman) IT WAS BEAUTIFUL!

28:46.255 --> 28:48.127
(man) WAY TO GO, MATTHEW!

28:48.127 --> 28:49.929
(woman) MANY HAPPY YEARS!

28:49.929 --> 28:52.061
(man) ALL RIGHT, MATTHEW!

28:52.061 --> 28:55.304
AAH! WHOO!

28:55.304 --> 28:58.367

29:09.919 --> 29:11.180

29:11.180 --> 29:12.521

29:12.521 --> 29:15.124
HOW DOES KEPNER GET THAT?
HOW DOES THAT HAPPEN?

29:15.124 --> 29:16.986
AND I GET CRAZY,
I GET CANCER,

29:16.986 --> 29:19.328
AND NOW I GOT
A PSYCHOPATHIC MANIAC.

29:19.328 --> 29:21.160
SCREW IT. I GIVE UP.
I'M WALKING AWAY.

29:21.160 --> 29:22.331
ALEX, WHAT WERE YOU
GONNA DO

29:22.331 --> 29:24.333
IF YOU GOT
TO PECKWELL'S HOUSE FIRST?

29:24.333 --> 29:26.365
WERE YOU GONNA HAVE COFFEE
AND TALK IT OUT?

29:26.365 --> 29:27.967
I MEAN, TELL ME
HE WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN WORSE OFF

29:27.967 --> 29:29.368
HAD YOU GOTTEN THERE FIRST.

29:29.368 --> 29:32.771
PEOPLE CHANGE,
BUT THEY DON'T CHANGE.

29:32.771 --> 29:35.404
MAYBE JO's CRAZY
FITS YOUR CRAZY.

29:35.404 --> 29:38.107
DON'T GIVE UP ON HER
JUST YET.

29:38.107 --> 29:39.778
WE DIDN'T GIVE UP ON YOU.

29:39.778 --> 29:43.252
(clears throat)

29:43.252 --> 29:44.413
CHEST PECKWELL IS AWAKE.

29:44.413 --> 29:46.385
HOW IS HE?

29:46.385 --> 29:47.456
HE'S FINE.

29:47.456 --> 29:50.389
BUT HE'S--HE'S ASKING
FOR THE POLICE.

29:52.221 --> 29:57.166
(thunder rumbling,
rain falling)

29:57.166 --> 29:59.999
I THOUGHT THIS STORM
WAS COMING IN THREE DAYS.
YOU KNOW WEATHER GUYS.

29:59.999 --> 30:03.102
THEY'RE WRONG MOST OF THE TIME,
AND THEY STILL KEEP THEIR JOBS.
(clicks penlight)

30:03.102 --> 30:06.275
HOW DO YOU FEEL, HONESTLY?

30:06.275 --> 30:08.407
HONESTLY? (inhales deeply)

30:08.407 --> 30:10.109
I'D FEEL BETTER
IF THE WALL HADN'T DISSECTED.

30:10.109 --> 30:13.342
I'M AFRAID IT'S DONE
MORE HARM THAN GOOD.

30:13.342 --> 30:15.014
(rumbling continues)

30:15.014 --> 30:16.946
DEREK.

30:16.946 --> 30:18.517
HOW DID I MISS THIS CLOT?

30:18.517 --> 30:20.489
YOU DIDN'T,
OR IT'D STILL BE IN THERE.

30:20.489 --> 30:22.892
YOU'VE DONE EVERYTHING
YOU CAN.

30:22.892 --> 30:26.555
THEN WHY ISN'T HE AWAKE?

30:26.555 --> 30:30.229
(thunderclap)

30:30.229 --> 30:33.432
(siren wailing)

30:33.432 --> 30:36.365
(horn honking)

30:36.365 --> 30:38.367
(fusses)
HE LOOKS BEAUTIFUL.

30:38.367 --> 30:42.411
YEAH, AND WHEN HE'S 6 FEET TALL
AND HAS A FULL HEAD OF HAIR,

30:42.411 --> 30:44.573
ALL OF THIS IS GONNA RECEDE
TO JUST A TINY, LITTLE SCAR

30:44.573 --> 30:46.315
ON HIS FOREHEAD.

30:46.315 --> 30:47.616
THE GIRLS ARE GONNA LOVE IT.
IT'LL GIVE HIM SOME MYSTERY.

30:47.616 --> 30:49.178
(chuckles)

30:49.178 --> 30:52.121
THANK YOU... SO MUCH.

30:52.121 --> 30:53.852

(thunderclap)

30:53.852 --> 30:55.424
(sighs) AMAZING.

30:55.424 --> 30:56.625
MM.
THIS WAS AN AMAZING DAY.

30:56.625 --> 30:58.227
WELL, YOU GUYS
DID MOST OF THE WORK.

30:58.227 --> 30:59.889
I'M HAPPY
I JUST GOT TO WATCH.

30:59.889 --> 31:04.333
YEAH, WELL, IS THERE
ANYTHING ELSE THAT I CAN...

31:04.333 --> 31:05.634
YOU CAN SHOW ME
TO AN ON-CALL ROOM.

31:05.634 --> 31:08.167
UH... W-WHY?

31:08.167 --> 31:09.468
FIRST NIGHT POST-OP,
I LIKE TO STAY CLOSE BY

31:09.468 --> 31:11.140
IN CASE ANYTHING HAPPENS.

31:11.140 --> 31:13.372
OH, WOW,
YOU POOR, POOR CONTROL FREAK.

31:13.372 --> 31:15.244
OH, YOU REALLY GET ME.

31:15.244 --> 31:17.076
YEAH. (laughs)
I REALLY DO.

31:17.076 --> 31:18.177
(telephone rings)

31:18.177 --> 31:20.379
THIS WAY.

31:20.379 --> 31:23.012
(lightning cracks)

31:23.012 --> 31:26.916
(thunder rumbling)

31:26.916 --> 31:28.117
HEY, JASON.

31:28.117 --> 31:31.490
(exhales) COPS HERE YET?

31:31.490 --> 31:33.993
LET'S TALK FOR A SECOND.

31:33.993 --> 31:35.894
SHE ATTACKED ME, ALL RIGHT?
JO's A LUNATIC.

31:35.894 --> 31:39.268
SHE'S DISTURBED,
AND SHE'S A LIAR.
(chair wheels rolling)

31:39.268 --> 31:40.669
LISTEN...

31:40.669 --> 31:42.601
YOU GOT A GOOD THING HERE.

31:42.601 --> 31:45.334
GOOD JOB.

31:45.334 --> 31:47.306
NICE PLACE.

31:47.306 --> 31:49.538
YOU HAVE FRIENDS HERE?

31:49.538 --> 31:51.941
OH, YOU WANNA BE
MY FRIEND NOW?

31:51.941 --> 31:56.045
ME? NAH. (chuckles)
I GOT ENOUGH FRIENDS.

31:56.045 --> 31:58.317
CRISTINA YANG--
SHE'S MY FRIEND.

31:58.317 --> 32:00.319
SHE OWNS THE HOSPITAL.

32:00.319 --> 32:03.492
DEREK SHEPHERD.
OWNS THE HOSPITAL.

32:03.492 --> 32:06.255
MEREDITH GREY--HER NAME'S
ON THE FRIGGIN' DOOR.

32:06.255 --> 32:07.656
AND THESE ARE MY FRIENDS.

32:07.656 --> 32:11.330
AND THEY DON'T LIKE A GUY
WHO HITS HIS GIRLFRIEND.

32:11.330 --> 32:12.931
NEITHER DO I.

32:12.931 --> 32:14.403
SHE ATTACKED ME.

32:14.403 --> 32:16.705
WHAT WAS I SUPPOSED TO DO?

32:16.705 --> 32:19.268
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO TAKE IT.
A GIRL HITS YOU,

32:19.268 --> 32:22.471
YOU TAKE IT,
OR YOU WALK AWAY.

32:22.471 --> 32:25.614
IT'S THE STORY OF MY LIFE.

32:25.614 --> 32:28.547
JASON, YOU CAN TELL THIS STORY
TILL YOU'RE BLUE IN THE FACE,

32:28.547 --> 32:30.479
BUT ALL PEOPLE
ARE GONNA HEAR

32:30.479 --> 32:33.082
IS THAT YOU HIT HER.

32:33.082 --> 32:35.084
AND THAT LITTLE BIT--

32:35.084 --> 32:37.456
IT'S GONNA FOLLOW YOU
AROUND THE HALLS HERE.

32:37.456 --> 32:39.328
AND IF YOU LEAVE,

32:39.328 --> 32:42.061
IT'LL GET WHEREVER YOU'RE GOING
BEFORE YOU DO.

32:42.061 --> 32:44.363
OH, YOU'LL MAKE SURE
OF THAT, HUH?

32:44.363 --> 32:46.335
IT SOUNDS LIKE
YOU'RE BLACKMAILING ME.

32:46.335 --> 32:49.238
IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE A GUY
WHO HITS GIRLS,

32:49.238 --> 32:51.270
'CAUSE YOU DID.

32:51.270 --> 32:53.572
SO WHAT DO YOU WANNA DO
NEXT?

33:01.210 --> 33:02.381
WHAT'D HE SAY?

33:02.381 --> 33:03.752
WHAT, YOU HEARD THAT?

33:03.752 --> 33:05.154
I DID.

33:05.154 --> 33:07.316
YOU THINK IT'S OKAY
TO BLACKMAIL PEOPLE, KAREV?

33:07.316 --> 33:09.188
I WASN'T.
IT WAS JUST A THREAT.

33:09.188 --> 33:10.459
YOU'RE THREATENING HIM?

33:10.459 --> 33:11.760
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?

33:11.760 --> 33:13.292
A BUNCH OF PEOPLE
GOT HURT HERE.

33:13.292 --> 33:14.493
I DIDN'T SEE THE POINT
IN ANY MORE.

33:14.493 --> 33:16.265
I MEAN, THE GUY'S NOT
PRESSING CHARGES.

33:16.265 --> 33:19.698
OH, SO IT ALL WORKS OUT.
YOU FEEL GOOD ABOUT THAT?

33:19.698 --> 33:21.330

33:31.640 --> 33:34.043

ON A SURGERY,

33:34.043 --> 33:35.614
YOU SCRUB IN
ON THAT SURGERY.

33:35.614 --> 33:39.288
THE LAST I HEARD, YOU'RE NOT
CHIEF OF SURGERY OR MY BOSS.

33:39.288 --> 33:40.719
BUT I AM PART OWNER
OF THIS HOSPITAL,

33:40.719 --> 33:43.292
WHICH DOES, IN FACT,
MAKE ME YOUR BOSS.

33:43.292 --> 33:44.423
AND YOU'RE NOT A FILE CLERK.

33:44.423 --> 33:46.325
WE HAVE ENOUGH FILE CLERKS.

33:46.325 --> 33:47.696
BUT WE NEED A SURGEONS.

33:47.696 --> 33:50.559

OWEN'S, UH, TRANSFERRING
PAUL DAWSON AND HIS KID

37:44.993 --> 37:46.835
OVER TO SEATTLE PRES.

37:46.835 --> 37:48.667
(indistinct conversations)

37:48.667 --> 37:50.339
HOW'S OWEN?

37:50.339 --> 37:51.940
I DON'T KNOW.

37:51.940 --> 37:53.572
YOU KNOW,
I WOKE THE GUY UP.

37:53.572 --> 37:54.843
THAT'S ALL HE'S BEEN
WANTING TO DO,

37:54.843 --> 37:58.347
BUT NOW HE JUST SEEMS
MORE DISAPPOINTED WITH ME,

37:58.347 --> 38:00.879
AND I KNOW HE'S GOT CLOSE
TO THE KID.

38:00.879 --> 38:03.412
(crunches)
YOU KNOW, OWEN WAS TALKING

38:03.412 --> 38:05.684
ABOUT TAKING THE KID HIMSELF.

38:05.684 --> 38:08.587
TAKING HIM?

38:08.587 --> 38:09.818
WHAT, LIKE A-ADOPTING HIM?

38:09.818 --> 38:11.490
OR FOSTERING.

38:11.490 --> 38:14.323
HE ASKED ME ABOUT IT.
HE SEEMED READY TO DO IT.

38:14.323 --> 38:16.425
OKAY, WHAT AM I SUPPOSED
TO DO WITH THAT?

38:16.425 --> 38:17.696
LIKE, WHAT AM I SUPPOSED
TO DO?

38:17.696 --> 38:20.969
I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANYTHING
YOU CAN DO.

38:20.969 --> 38:24.473
I DON'T THINK
IT'S ABOUT YOU.

38:35.714 --> 38:37.616
YOU GUYS HAVE
BACKUP GENERATORS, RIGHT?

38:37.616 --> 38:39.648

A LOT OF FUN.

38:53.862 --> 38:55.804
