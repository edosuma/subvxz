If you're gambling on your next vacation,
make the smart bet.

04:52.375 --> 04:54.460
Come see us here at the Missouri Belle.

05:11.352 --> 05:13.354
I think that it needed more star wipes.

05:16.232 --> 05:18.651
Oh, you think?

05:19.152 --> 05:20.028
Great idea.

05:21.904 --> 05:24.866
-Well, I will get right to work. Okay.
-[Wendy] Okay.

05:24.949 --> 05:26.909
Thank you so much.

05:31.122 --> 05:32.582
What else we have today?

05:32.665 --> 05:34.667
[Charlotte sighs] Um...

05:35.418 --> 05:39.422
The lady who wanted to open
the toe ring stand is here at ten.

05:40.173 --> 05:43.968
And then at noon, it's the president
of the Midwest Dental Alliance.

05:46.929 --> 05:49.057
-[Wendy] Noon, right?
-Yeah.

06:29.514 --> 06:30.598
Good morning, sir.

06:32.475 --> 06:35.395
Two o'clock,
Paddock Road Truck Stop, I-70.

06:36.020 --> 06:39.440
Did your mom smoke a lot of weed
when she was pregnant with you?

06:39.732 --> 06:41.150
Huff paint, maybe?

06:41.901 --> 06:43.152
What's your fucking problem?

06:43.236 --> 06:45.196
We already used that spot.

06:45.363 --> 06:46.697
Three months ago.

06:46.823 --> 06:50.243
We need to alter every delivery
in case if we're being surveilled.

06:50.326 --> 06:53.413
That means different fucking days,
different fucking weeks,

06:53.496 --> 06:55.289
and different fucking locations.

06:56.582 --> 06:57.542
What else you got?

06:57.625 --> 07:01.712
You know, I know how this shit works
a whole lot better than you.

07:02.088 --> 07:03.965
It doesn't seem like it.

07:04.132 --> 07:07.844
There's an old park off I-29
near mile marker 57.

07:08.219 --> 07:10.346
Yeah, no, I already gave my guys the drop.

07:11.389 --> 07:12.682
They got other deliveries.

07:13.516 --> 07:15.726
[Ruth] Okay, I'll be at the park at four.

07:16.018 --> 07:17.437
That'll give enough time for them

07:17.520 --> 07:20.440
to emotionally adjust
to the change of plans.

07:21.941 --> 07:23.192
Don't be fucking late.

07:26.195 --> 07:27.989
Uh, hey, Ruth,
can I have a water, please?

07:28.072 --> 07:32.118
Ten a.m., ten a.m.,
and he already smells like fucking booze.

07:33.536 --> 07:35.913
Why don't you calm down
and forget about it, okay?

07:35.997 --> 07:38.499
Tell me how
the poker tournament's coming together.

07:38.583 --> 07:40.751
You know, if my daddy ran the KC mob--

07:40.835 --> 07:42.420
He doesn't. Leave it.

07:42.503 --> 07:45.882
We already paid them a fucking fortune
because we already pissed them off.

07:45.965 --> 07:48.468
All right? I want you to concentrate
on bringing in the high rollers.

07:48.801 --> 07:49.844
-Got it?
-Okay.

07:50.511 --> 07:53.973
So does getting the game up mean
we're finally gonna get to work?

07:54.056 --> 07:56.642
No, getting the game on means
we get more people in this casino.

07:56.726 --> 07:58.102
We're already working.

07:58.519 --> 08:00.188
I made five pickups already.

08:00.271 --> 08:02.648
Which is fine. I don't mind dealing
with those dickheads.

08:02.732 --> 08:04.984
I'm fucking management, I'm mature.

08:05.193 --> 08:07.820
But all that cash
is just sitting with Buddy

08:07.904 --> 08:09.030
doing jack squat.

08:10.615 --> 08:13.409
Listen, I'm not gonna start
laundering again

08:13.493 --> 08:14.785
until I feel completely safe.

08:14.869 --> 08:16.787
We hired over 200 people in this place.

08:16.871 --> 08:20.750
Law of averages tells me that the FBI
already planted an agent.

08:20.875 --> 08:22.919
[Ruth] Then you should've
fucking vetted people better.

08:23.044 --> 08:26.130
It was just me and one other human
at a desk. How can I trust that?

08:26.214 --> 08:28.758
[scoffs] Well, what the fuck else
is there to trust?

08:29.509 --> 08:30.593
[sighs] Listen.

08:30.676 --> 08:34.180
As individuals, people are
completely unpredictable. Okay?

08:34.514 --> 08:37.099
One person making one bet,
I couldn't tell you what they're gonna do.

08:37.183 --> 08:40.561
But the law of large numbers tells me
a million people making a million bets,

08:40.645 --> 08:42.647
that is completely predictable,
completely ordered.

08:42.772 --> 08:44.941
So, you give me a million people
walking in this place

08:45.024 --> 08:47.735
and I can tell you that 3%
are trying to cheat us,

08:47.818 --> 08:50.530
while another 1,2%
would have been sent here

08:50.863 --> 08:52.490
to try to catch us committing a crime.

08:52.573 --> 08:55.618
There will be a pattern
as to how those 3% are trying to cheat us,

08:55.701 --> 08:58.955
just as sure as there's a pattern
as to how the 1,2% are trying to catch us.

08:59.038 --> 09:02.458
And you give me a little bit
of surveillance and a little bit of time,

09:02.708 --> 09:04.210
and I'll find that pattern.

09:04.835 --> 09:05.836
Good morning.

09:08.714 --> 09:10.633
Jesus, fuck, you love this shit.

09:12.051 --> 09:14.178
Well, I'm just trying to keep us safe.

09:20.101 --> 09:22.853
[man] Obviously,
gambling has an allure for some,

09:22.937 --> 09:24.397
it's just not for everyone.

09:24.522 --> 09:28.985
I'm sure you can imagine,
dentists are a very diverse crew.

09:30.528 --> 09:34.448
Which is why I think
we are the perfect destination.

09:34.574 --> 09:36.784
We're not just offering
the Missouri Belle.

09:36.867 --> 09:38.869
It's the whole lake. It's the community.

09:38.953 --> 09:41.747
There are so many ways
to live your best life here.

09:41.956 --> 09:43.541
[man] It's just... [sighs]

09:44.333 --> 09:47.753
...I'm the president,
and this convention is my legacy.

09:48.129 --> 09:50.339
We went to Branson
under the last administration.

09:50.423 --> 09:51.382
Have you ever been?

09:52.008 --> 09:54.260
Hell, it's not just country.
That is a misnomer.

09:54.343 --> 09:58.556
We saw Molly Hatchet open for 38 Special.

09:59.807 --> 10:00.975
-Dr. Meade--
-Fred.

10:01.726 --> 10:04.687
Fr-- Well, let's-- let's cut right to it,
shall we, Fred?

10:05.313 --> 10:06.731
What is it gonna take...

10:07.523 --> 10:09.817
to put us over the top
and host your convention?

10:11.319 --> 10:12.695
REO Speedwagon.

10:16.157 --> 10:17.908
-REO Speedwagon.
-Yeah.

10:17.992 --> 10:20.119
If you're the kind of place
that can get the 'Wagon,

10:20.202 --> 10:22.204
you're gonna have yourself
a whole lot of dentists.

10:23.456 --> 10:24.290
Hmm.

10:54.612 --> 10:55.946
Motherfuckers.

11:00.409 --> 11:01.869
[Ruth] You're two hours late!

11:02.078 --> 11:03.996
[man] Whoa. What's the matter with you?

11:04.080 --> 11:05.956
I think I fucking just told you.

11:06.040 --> 11:07.667
Oh, right. I get it.

11:08.084 --> 11:09.001
Shark week?

11:10.127 --> 11:12.338
-Just give me my shit.
-Okay.

11:15.758 --> 11:17.927
[sighs] It's a nice spot.

11:20.680 --> 11:25.267
[grunts] I can see why you want us
to drive three hours out of the way to it.

11:31.232 --> 11:34.151
-Too bad we can't use it again.
-Next time, don't be fucking late.

11:34.235 --> 11:35.319
[man] Yeah.

11:37.154 --> 11:39.573
-[Ruth grunts]
-[driver's door opens]

11:39.865 --> 11:40.866
-Hello!
-[engine starts]

11:40.950 --> 11:42.535
-[man] Goodbye!
-[driver's door shuts]

12:01.929 --> 12:03.931
[TV playing indistinctly]

12:27.747 --> 12:29.498
[TV continues indistinctly]

12:29.582 --> 12:30.416
Hi.

12:32.334 --> 12:33.377
It's your lucky day.

12:33.461 --> 12:35.463
I got two steaks in my freezer,

12:35.546 --> 12:38.674
and if you'll run out and get them,
I'll cook for the both of us.

12:40.009 --> 12:41.051
[Ruth sighs]

12:41.135 --> 12:44.555
"Sure, Ruth, that sounds fucking awesome

12:44.638 --> 12:47.391
and real fucking nice of you, too!
Thanks."

12:48.684 --> 12:50.311
That sounds fucking awesome.

12:54.482 --> 12:56.150
What you smiling about?

12:56.233 --> 12:57.902
[clears throat] Um...

12:59.361 --> 13:02.782
[sighs]
Stacey's grandma is making sloppy joes.

13:04.033 --> 13:05.743
I mean, I could cancel if you want.

13:08.746 --> 13:11.665
I can't believe
someone's actually fucking dating you.

13:11.749 --> 13:13.459
[laughing]

13:26.096 --> 13:28.057
[engine starts, car door slams]

13:29.683 --> 13:31.602
[vehicle pulls away]

13:31.685 --> 13:33.229
[Jonah]
<i>What you do is you mine the gold</i>

13:33.312 --> 13:35.147
and then you sell it in bulk to a broker.

13:35.439 --> 13:38.067
It's almost like a commodities exchange,
and then...

13:38.150 --> 13:40.402
that third party sells it
to the mass market.

13:40.486 --> 13:42.321
Thank you for cooking. It smells great.

13:42.947 --> 13:44.365
[Charlotte]
Know what it pairs well with?

13:46.700 --> 13:47.535
Mom.

13:48.744 --> 13:49.662
One.

13:49.787 --> 13:50.996
But, sweetie, I just--

13:51.080 --> 13:53.332
I don't understand. It's a video game.

13:53.415 --> 13:55.793
-It's not real gold.
-Yeah, but gamers are real.

13:55.918 --> 13:57.628
And real people are impatient.

13:58.420 --> 14:00.005
They'll always pay to get ahead
if they can...

14:00.089 --> 14:02.842
-[Marty] Hi. Smells great.
-...and gold gets you to the next levels.

14:02.925 --> 14:04.760
[Wendy stammers] Is that even legal?

14:05.177 --> 14:07.930
Technically, no, but you can just log in
with a different username.

14:08.013 --> 14:09.473
[Wendy] Yeah, I don't like it.

14:10.224 --> 14:12.184
I've made $6,000 so far this month.

14:12.268 --> 14:14.395
$6,000? On what? That sounds good.

14:14.478 --> 14:18.232
Okay. The casino is open 24/7.
You don't have to watch it every second.

14:18.399 --> 14:20.860
I'm very well aware of that, honey.
We're on--

14:20.943 --> 14:24.196
-No phones at the dinner table.
-We just-- I just want you to have...

14:24.905 --> 14:26.907
a summer job, something...

14:27.449 --> 14:28.826
Something fun.

14:28.909 --> 14:30.536
Something outdoors.

14:30.661 --> 14:34.331
Whoa. Did I fall asleep five years
and miss your 21st birthday? What's that?

14:34.456 --> 14:36.458
[Wendy] No, it's just... it's just one.

14:36.542 --> 14:37.877
"Just one." Got it.

14:38.627 --> 14:40.629
[Charlotte]
Are you two going to therapy tomorrow?

14:40.713 --> 14:44.466
Yes, we're going to therapy tomorrow.
We're aware of your rules, Charlotte.

14:44.550 --> 14:47.261
But I don't need a job.
I already have one.

14:47.428 --> 14:50.806
Mining fake gold is not a job.

14:51.724 --> 14:53.893
Oh, and by the way, that reminds me,
there's a...

14:54.143 --> 14:57.271
I have a business idea I really wanted
to talk to you about.

14:58.272 --> 14:59.565
Okay, I'm intrigued.

14:59.690 --> 15:01.817
[Jonah]
You know, all money's actually imaginary.

15:04.361 --> 15:07.281
Uh, you know what, pal?
Maybe your mom is right. It is summer.

15:07.406 --> 15:09.575
Maybe you should be outdoors, huh?

15:10.159 --> 15:11.285
And maybe...

15:11.535 --> 15:13.495
uh, even make a friend, you know?

15:16.665 --> 15:17.666
Okay.

15:17.833 --> 15:19.919
And could I please have some lasagna?

15:25.090 --> 15:27.301
[door slides open]

15:28.552 --> 15:29.428
[closes]

15:32.514 --> 15:33.390
So, listen...

15:34.683 --> 15:37.061
I know how concerned you are
about security.

15:37.853 --> 15:38.812
And...

15:40.648 --> 15:43.108
I just want you to know
I've been thinking a lot about it, too.

15:44.526 --> 15:46.862
About safety... and our future.

15:48.656 --> 15:49.531
Okay.

15:52.242 --> 15:54.370
I've been reading about the cartel war.

15:55.746 --> 15:58.958
Navarro's lost 61 men
in the last five weeks alone.

15:59.291 --> 16:00.167
[Marty] Hmm.

16:01.335 --> 16:02.836
What's that got to do with us?

16:06.507 --> 16:08.050
There's a saying in politics.

16:09.426 --> 16:11.679
"Never let a good crisis go to waste."

16:16.225 --> 16:17.851
-And?
-And...

16:18.727 --> 16:20.354
Helen's coming into town.

16:20.437 --> 16:23.649
[stammers] I know,
you're expecting the worst, but let's...

16:24.942 --> 16:26.318
let's preempt that.

16:27.987 --> 16:29.738
Pitch her on the idea of expansion.

16:33.325 --> 16:34.451
What does that mean?

16:35.995 --> 16:36.870
Hotels.

16:37.413 --> 16:40.916
Casinos, but we keep
the daily operations legitimate.

16:41.291 --> 16:43.544
We sell the idea to Navarro
as a safety net.

16:44.044 --> 16:47.256
[stammers] We put his share in a trust...

16:47.423 --> 16:48.841
for his kids. Untouchable.

16:48.924 --> 16:50.718
That way, if the cartel war goes south,

16:50.801 --> 16:52.594
then he has a whole new revenue stream.

16:53.470 --> 16:54.596
Completely legal.

16:58.976 --> 16:59.935
Well?

17:02.730 --> 17:03.647
What do you think?

17:09.528 --> 17:12.614
Well, I just...
I think that's batshit crazy.

17:15.617 --> 17:16.577
It's not.

17:16.827 --> 17:18.162
-No?
-No.

17:19.747 --> 17:20.789
It's not.

17:22.291 --> 17:24.168
And actually, it was Helen's idea.

17:25.335 --> 17:27.463
She talked to us about expansion.

17:32.009 --> 17:33.135
There is a...

17:33.761 --> 17:35.179
hotel and casino

17:35.637 --> 17:37.765
on the Kansas border in St. Joe's.

17:37.848 --> 17:39.349
Its infrastructure is old.

17:39.433 --> 17:42.269
It's getting killed
by a casino across the river.

17:42.352 --> 17:45.564
And all it needs is an influx of cash
to upgrade,

17:45.647 --> 17:48.734
and they would crush their competition,
but their margins are too low.

17:48.859 --> 17:50.194
It's a win-win.

17:52.905 --> 17:53.906
No.

17:56.617 --> 17:57.618
Just like that?

17:58.410 --> 17:59.870
-Just like that.
-Jesus.

18:02.122 --> 18:03.457
[scoffs] Of course.

18:04.083 --> 18:06.418
-I'm trying to keep us safe, Wendy.
-Yeah, well, so am I.

18:06.502 --> 18:08.962
I mean, how much more fucking stress
do you wanna take on?

18:09.338 --> 18:11.131
This would all be legitimate.

18:12.841 --> 18:15.177
Except for the seed money
from the drug lord,

18:15.260 --> 18:17.596
which, by definition, is not legitimate?

18:17.679 --> 18:19.515
We are pre-approved
by the gaming commission.

18:19.598 --> 18:21.767
No one would question
the initial investment.

18:23.644 --> 18:25.479
We have Navarro's gratitude.

18:26.146 --> 18:27.731
This would only increase it.

18:31.151 --> 18:32.611
Don't you understand?

18:33.946 --> 18:34.905
We're in.

18:37.407 --> 18:40.119
We're alive. Big difference.

18:40.661 --> 18:43.455
You want to know what a good outcome
from this cartel war would be?

18:43.539 --> 18:45.499
Navarro getting blown
off the face of the Earth,

18:45.582 --> 18:47.292
and you and I being out
from underneath this.

18:47.376 --> 18:48.877
But what if that doesn't happen?

18:48.961 --> 18:51.880
Expansion makes us a political player.

18:51.964 --> 18:54.633
It insulates us, and that keeps us safe.

18:55.509 --> 18:58.011
We could be the very legitimate,

18:58.137 --> 19:00.556
very public face of Missouri gaming.
[chuckles]

19:01.515 --> 19:03.142
We'd be too big to fail.

19:03.308 --> 19:07.604
Wendy, I did not agree to stay here
to start raising red flag after red flag.

19:07.896 --> 19:09.273
It's the smart play.

19:09.439 --> 19:13.110
Stop. I'm here.
Take the fucking victory, okay?

19:13.235 --> 19:15.571
And do not tell me what is smart
and what is not smart.

19:15.654 --> 19:17.990
You blew through that stop sign
six months ago.

19:18.073 --> 19:19.408
Do you know what I did today?

19:20.367 --> 19:22.911
I talked to a woman
about her toe ring stand.

19:23.871 --> 19:27.040
I have the time. We have the clout.

19:27.624 --> 19:28.750
I can do this.

19:30.460 --> 19:33.088
Just think-- think about the things
we could build.

19:33.672 --> 19:35.757
Why should the Charles Wilkeses
of the world

19:35.841 --> 19:37.551
have a stranglehold on this state?

19:37.634 --> 19:39.261
We could have the money and the influence.

19:39.344 --> 19:41.680
We could control
every political lever in Missouri.

19:41.763 --> 19:44.766
We could give millions to the causes
that we care about.

19:44.850 --> 19:46.518
We could run this goddamn place.

19:47.644 --> 19:48.937
Do you even hear yourself?

19:49.271 --> 19:50.147
I do.

19:51.273 --> 19:52.232
Do you hear me?

19:52.941 --> 19:53.901
Good night.

19:53.984 --> 19:55.319
What? So that's it?

19:55.402 --> 19:57.654
-You're just gonna walk away?
-I'm not walking away.

19:57.738 --> 20:00.699
Really? That's funny. I'm standing here,
you're moving the other way.

20:00.782 --> 20:01.867
I'm saving it for therapy.

20:01.950 --> 20:04.286
Great. You wanna save everything
for fucking therapy!

20:04.369 --> 20:06.371
Well, that's what it's there for,
isn't it?

20:09.499 --> 20:10.751
[water splashing]

20:10.834 --> 20:13.003
[man, in Spanish]
What does your husband have on you?

20:13.086 --> 20:14.046
[woman whimpers]

20:14.129 --> 20:16.673
You said the divorce was settled.

20:16.798 --> 20:19.051
[sputtering, gagging]

20:19.134 --> 20:22.471
Why does he suddenly think
he can win a custody battle?

20:22.554 --> 20:23.597
[woman cries out]

20:23.680 --> 20:25.265
What does he know?

20:25.349 --> 20:26.475
Bring her up.

20:26.558 --> 20:28.602
[gagging, sputtering]

20:28.685 --> 20:29.853
What does he know?

20:29.937 --> 20:31.480
[panting]

20:31.563 --> 20:34.274
[in English]
Nothing. He's an entitled asshole.

20:34.358 --> 20:37.778
I have always shielded my family
from every aspect of the business.

20:37.861 --> 20:39.571
[in Spanish]
But we have to be sure, no?

20:40.864 --> 20:42.950
[gasping]

20:43.033 --> 20:45.118
[gagging, coughing]

20:45.202 --> 20:48.163
[man continues indistinctly in Spanish]

20:52.167 --> 20:55.254
[gasps, panting]

21:03.136 --> 21:05.639
[in English]
And you realize that this all goes away...

21:06.139 --> 21:07.808
if he just disappears?

21:07.891 --> 21:09.893
[panting, coughs]

21:09.977 --> 21:13.313
I told you, he doesn't know anything.

21:22.114 --> 21:24.574
[woman] No matter what I do,
I just can't get her to latch.

21:24.658 --> 21:27.160
Even if I manage,
it takes an hour for her to feed,

21:27.244 --> 21:30.414
which means it's only another hour
before I have to start again.

21:30.831 --> 21:32.124
I don't know what to do.

21:33.041 --> 21:35.335
I mean, I can't give her formula.

21:35.502 --> 21:38.088
I've read the studies.
Those babies don't thrive.

21:38.714 --> 21:40.340
[woman 2] It's all just overwhelming.

21:40.590 --> 21:43.552
My husband started working double shifts,
so he's never home,

21:43.927 --> 21:46.096
but we still can't afford full-time help.

21:46.763 --> 21:50.434
Well, at least your baby's not gonna die
from being poisoned by formula.

21:51.810 --> 21:55.897
Darlene, please remember
this is an emotionally safe space.

21:55.981 --> 21:57.024
I'm sorry.

21:58.066 --> 22:01.445
But you know,
I lost my husband six months ago,

22:01.528 --> 22:03.155
and I am on my own.

22:03.905 --> 22:05.657
And Ezekiel was born premature,

22:05.741 --> 22:08.744
so I worry about health issues.

22:11.038 --> 22:12.831
I didn't mean any offense.

22:13.332 --> 22:15.208
I know you didn't, sweetheart.

22:31.224 --> 22:33.393
-[air hissing]
-[grunts]

23:22.943 --> 23:25.570
[inhaling]

23:43.797 --> 23:45.465
[Ruth] How you paying for that, anyway?

23:45.549 --> 23:48.009
You know, I've been depositing money
in your account.

23:49.344 --> 23:50.345
Yeah, I know.

23:52.055 --> 23:53.640
Then fucking take it!

23:54.891 --> 23:55.725
What?

23:55.892 --> 23:59.938
They grow virgin ears in Overland Park
or Webster Grove or wherever the fuck?

24:00.105 --> 24:01.314
Bill your shit.

24:06.778 --> 24:08.405
Just fucking take the money.

24:08.905 --> 24:11.825
[Wendy] The problem is
we have very different philosophies

24:11.908 --> 24:13.368
about how to move forward.

24:13.577 --> 24:16.997
Well, that's going to happen
in a marriage, isn't it?

24:17.372 --> 24:19.833
Especially if business is involved.

24:19.916 --> 24:23.670
But in this case,
the ramifications are much more serious.

24:24.004 --> 24:26.006
It can feel that way.

24:26.923 --> 24:30.594
[Marty] Wendy has a much higher tolerance
for risk than I do.

24:30.719 --> 24:31.595
Well...

24:32.637 --> 24:35.056
let's dig into that a bit.

24:35.140 --> 24:37.142
That scares you, doesn't it?

24:39.019 --> 24:39.895
It does.

24:40.562 --> 24:44.566
[woman] Wendy, can you tell Marty
you understand he's scared?

24:47.652 --> 24:49.196
I understand you're scared.

24:49.738 --> 24:51.615
And when you get frightened...

24:52.240 --> 24:53.992
you withdraw.

24:55.660 --> 24:56.620
I do.

24:57.621 --> 24:58.663
[woman] Wendy.

24:59.206 --> 25:02.375
Sometimes, if you don't move forward...

25:03.043 --> 25:04.044
you die.

25:05.045 --> 25:08.548
[woman] Maybe it's best if we hold back
on the hyperbole.

25:10.884 --> 25:15.096
And why do you think
this is so loaded for you?

25:16.556 --> 25:19.809
Uh, well, I had a--
I used to have a business partner

25:19.893 --> 25:22.395
that, uh... that took unnecessary risks.

25:22.979 --> 25:27.776
[laughs] He didn't take unnecessary risks.
He was trying to cheat the system.

25:27.859 --> 25:29.778
I'm not trying to cheat the system.

25:29.861 --> 25:31.655
-I'm trying to grow the business.
-He blew up the company.

25:31.738 --> 25:33.573
-I'm not trying to cheat anybody.
-It's unfortunate.

25:33.657 --> 25:36.785
Okay, uh, let's take a step back.

25:38.453 --> 25:41.373
May I offer an observation?

25:43.124 --> 25:44.084
Please.

25:44.709 --> 25:49.256
Do you feel like most of the big movement,

25:49.381 --> 25:51.174
philosophically at least,

25:51.424 --> 25:52.884
has been from you?

25:53.802 --> 25:54.803
Or...

25:56.054 --> 25:58.098
has it really been from Marty?

26:08.942 --> 26:11.403
I swear, she always takes your side.

26:11.486 --> 26:13.238
I think she wants to sleep with you.

26:13.947 --> 26:16.575
Well, if she ever sides with me too much,
you'll know why.

26:17.325 --> 26:18.994
Let's just keep talking, okay?

26:22.038 --> 26:24.541
[both cars starting]

26:36.928 --> 26:38.221
[turns off engine]

26:41.182 --> 26:43.852
-[door opens]
-[Marty] Sue? Hey, there you are.

26:43.935 --> 26:48.773
[sighs] That was perfect.
I thought you were dynamite. Um...

26:49.107 --> 26:51.192
Next time, go a little bit tougher on me.

26:51.276 --> 26:54.946
You know?
Let her win a round or two, you know?

26:56.031 --> 26:57.824
That sound like a good plan to you?

26:57.907 --> 27:00.035
Either way, it's all fascinating.

27:00.118 --> 27:00.994
All right.

27:01.786 --> 27:05.123
Tea smells delicious, by the way.
We'll see ya.

27:06.249 --> 27:07.250
[door shuts]

27:08.168 --> 27:09.461
[sighs]

27:11.046 --> 27:12.464
[door opens]

27:18.345 --> 27:20.430
So this is where all the action is, huh?

27:21.222 --> 27:22.557
I thought you were at work.

27:23.058 --> 27:24.643
Yeah, well, Mom kicked me out.

27:24.726 --> 27:26.061
It's pretty ironic, huh?

27:28.688 --> 27:29.981
I got you something.

27:31.441 --> 27:32.484
Are you okay?

27:32.734 --> 27:35.153
Because summer jobs and friends...

27:35.737 --> 27:37.781
Mom and Dad don't know
what they're talking about.

27:37.864 --> 27:38.948
You know that, right?

27:41.910 --> 27:43.870
[unzipping bag]

27:43.953 --> 27:45.914
If you get mushy on me, I'll take it back.

27:49.626 --> 27:50.794
Holy shit!

27:51.252 --> 27:52.420
Is this for real?

27:52.504 --> 27:55.632
Yeah. You have to leave the gold mine
every once in a while.

27:56.216 --> 27:57.717
I-- I can pay you back.

27:57.801 --> 27:59.052
No. Please, come on.

28:02.138 --> 28:05.266
Like Mom and Dad ever spend any time
outdoors themselves.

28:10.355 --> 28:13.733
You must be excited.
Tourist season, booming economy.

28:14.442 --> 28:16.736
How is the casino business, anyway?

28:18.029 --> 28:19.155
I understand you're upset.

28:19.572 --> 28:21.282
[Helen] Oh, really? Do I seem upset?

28:21.449 --> 28:23.368
My client, on the other hand...

28:23.451 --> 28:25.161
-[Marty] We've been over all this.
-Yes, we have.

28:25.245 --> 28:27.872
Considering the amount of hires
that we had to make, there's no way--

28:27.956 --> 28:30.041
[Helen] Yes, you don't know
who might've infiltrated,

28:30.125 --> 28:32.210
so you don't wanna launder. I understand.

28:32.585 --> 28:36.464
Just as I'm sure you understand that
I didn't ask to drive to the Ozarks today,

28:36.548 --> 28:39.676
but we all have to do things that are
outside our comfort zone, don't we?

28:42.345 --> 28:44.431
They think that we killed a fed.

28:45.014 --> 28:47.684
Agent Petty’s DNA was
all over Cade Langmore’s truck.

28:47.767 --> 28:49.477
They know you didn’t kill him.

28:50.311 --> 28:51.688
But you know what I mean.

28:51.771 --> 28:56.401
I think what none of us can account for
is the emotional component for the FBI.

28:56.818 --> 28:59.195
We can't be sure
what level of resources they'll invest.

28:59.738 --> 29:01.906
So, is it a tougher hand? Sure.

29:02.240 --> 29:03.575
But the reality is,

29:03.658 --> 29:06.828
it doesn't matter if they think
that you hired Cade<i> </i>to get rid of Petty 

29:06.911 --> 29:08.288
and then got rid of him.

29:08.747 --> 29:11.499
You've always known
the laundering would have to be done

29:11.583 --> 29:12.959
right under the FBI's nose.

29:13.042 --> 29:14.711
[Marty] And it will.
I just need some time

29:14.794 --> 29:16.963
before I start moving
tens of millions of dollars

29:17.046 --> 29:18.047
through that building.

29:18.423 --> 29:21.468
You're supposed to be the best.
That's why you were hired.

29:22.010 --> 29:23.762
Well, then listen to me, okay?

29:23.845 --> 29:26.181
People as individuals
are completely unpredictable.

29:26.264 --> 29:29.100
One person making one bet,
there's no way I could possibly know

29:29.184 --> 29:32.145
which way he or she is gonna go,
but the law of large numbers--

29:32.228 --> 29:34.439
Yeah, you're mistaking this
for a discussion.

29:35.273 --> 29:39.819
Look, I was sent here for a simple reason,
to deliver one simple message in person,

29:40.278 --> 29:42.071
despite my own various shit-shows,

29:42.155 --> 29:45.158
which I guarantee stack up quite nicely
against your own.

29:46.576 --> 29:48.453
Launder the fucking money.

29:55.335 --> 29:57.420

We're good.

30:01.424 --> 30:02.425
[Helen] Good.

30:05.637 --> 30:07.013

-Mm-hmm.

30:26.115 --> 30:28.159
Just how stressed is our boss about...

30:30.036 --> 30:31.120
what's going on?

30:33.289 --> 30:35.250
Well, I can tell you
from personal experience,

30:35.333 --> 30:36.918
he's in a hyper-vigilant place.

30:39.337 --> 30:41.172
Would he be open to a solution...

30:43.258 --> 30:45.301
that might alleviate some of his stress?

30:46.719 --> 30:47.804
Meaning what?

30:49.138 --> 30:50.431
I have a proposal.

30:52.308 --> 30:54.018
[laughs] Actually, it was your idea.

30:55.979 --> 30:58.314
[Ruth] Well, thank you.
I will call you in a few days.

30:59.566 --> 31:02.485
[Frank Jr. gulps]
Hey, you. I got a question for you.

31:03.236 --> 31:05.446
Let's hear it, fuck-nut. [sighs]

31:05.530 --> 31:08.658
I heard you're sending limos
to the St. Louis and KC airports.

31:09.158 --> 31:12.287
Are you running a high-stakes game?
If so, I want in.

31:13.538 --> 31:15.206
You're kidding me, right?

31:15.290 --> 31:17.542
I play. I can afford it. I want a seat.

31:18.084 --> 31:19.586
No fucking way.

Sometimes I think you forget
who you're talking to.

31:22.005 --> 31:24.340
'Cause your daddy runs the KC mob?

31:24.591 --> 31:28.094
You really think it's smart to have you

31:28.177 --> 31:29.637
It's a bunch of lawyers
and hedge fund sharks.

31:29.762 --> 31:32.181
Do you honestly think
that's a different table than mine?

31:32.265 --> 31:35.727
Let me say this
as respectfully as I possibly can.

31:35.810 --> 31:39.147
Would you please kindly fuck yourself
and leave me alone?

31:39.230 --> 31:40.315
Thank you.

31:40.732 --> 31:43.484
You need to learn
to watch your fucking mouth.

31:44.611 --> 31:45.862
What was that all about?

31:45.945 --> 31:48.197
Frank Jr. wants in, but I shut him down.

31:49.490 --> 31:51.576
[stammers] Um, well, hang on...

31:53.036 --> 31:54.245

31:55.622 --> 31:56.748
Are you fucking crazy?

31:56.831 --> 31:59.125
[Marty] Uh, you know,
we got bigger problems.

31:59.417 --> 32:02.921
Really? Than some mobbed-up drunk
who's wanting to have a seat at our table?

32:03.004 --> 32:04.923
Well, um, our...

32:05.340 --> 32:09.135
our partners are demanding
that we start laundering tomorrow.

32:09.719 --> 32:13.348
So, yes, right now
having a pissed off Frank Jr. on the floor

32:13.431 --> 32:15.892
is a bigger problem
than having him happy and at the table.

32:15.975 --> 32:18.770
So, we can’t afford any problems.
Let him play.

32:19.854 --> 32:23.608
Okay, I'll get a crew to smurf money in.
I mean, how many guys do you want?

32:23.691 --> 32:24.692
I got a backup plan.

32:24.776 --> 32:26.903

But no one is watching the new empty
cash boxes that are replacing them.

32:47.256 --> 32:49.425
So, if...

32:49.717 --> 32:52.595
if those boxes are already lined
with cash...

32:52.679 --> 32:55.765

Huh.

33:00.269 --> 33:01.187
Yeah.

as a legitimate entity

43:54.882 --> 43:56.342

which means they can create
revenue streams

44:00.554 --> 44:03.766
free of any legal entanglements,
which might give you a safety net.

44:03.849 --> 44:04.850
Why?

44:05.434 --> 44:07.186
Because they are pristine.

44:07.269 --> 44:08.646
Because they're white.

44:09.104 --> 44:10.314
Semantics.

44:13.025 --> 44:14.401
[inhales deeply]

44:15.653 --> 44:19.239
Wendy has identified a casino and hotel
in Northwest Missouri

44:19.323 --> 44:21.617
that needs an influx of cash to survive.

44:21.700 --> 44:24.370
I have seen the financials. She is right.

44:25.537 --> 44:27.623
-It could give you a foothold.
-[sighs]

44:27.706 --> 44:29.875
Why should I be worrying about this now?

44:30.000 --> 44:31.543
-[Helen] Well, we were thinking--
-Eh-eh.

44:36.131 --> 44:36.965
Please.

44:40.427 --> 44:44.973
Because you might very well be dead
in six months.

44:47.726 --> 44:49.228
We are all parents here,

44:49.937 --> 44:52.189
and if this war goes wrong...

44:53.232 --> 44:55.109
what can you leave your kids?

44:56.318 --> 44:57.903
[stammers] Or if you're arrested

44:58.112 --> 45:00.406
and-- and there's no...

45:00.864 --> 45:03.784
legitimate assets unencumbered
for them to access?

45:03.867 --> 45:04.910
[stammering] I...

45:05.494 --> 45:08.831
I mean, I imagine
you followed the trial last year.

45:08.914 --> 45:11.750
It was not your organization,
but-- but still,

45:12.543 --> 45:15.212
their kids, they had them testify
against their parents

45:15.295 --> 45:18.632
because they were--
they were trapped in the family business,

45:18.716 --> 45:21.385
and this-- this gives them
a different path.

45:23.345 --> 45:25.222
If you know you have a future,

45:26.223 --> 45:28.851
there's no reason to blow up anything
in the present.

45:30.144 --> 45:33.188
And-- And in two years,
if we're not all dead or in jail,

45:34.148 --> 45:36.567
what's wrong with millions more
legitimate cash?

45:38.777 --> 45:40.779
I've run the numbers, and I really think--

45:49.580 --> 45:50.497
Okay.

46:01.175 --> 46:02.092
[Wendy] I'm sorry.

46:02.509 --> 46:06.472
[Helen] Honestly, that's the longest
I've ever seen him sit for a meeting.

46:10.642 --> 46:11.977
[engine starts]

46:14.855 --> 46:16.106
[Marty] As you see...

46:16.815 --> 46:20.527
all the players in the game have filed
their 8300.

46:24.615 --> 46:27.326
Even Frank Cosgrove Jr.?

46:28.577 --> 46:32.539
$50,000 buy-in automatically triggers
a filing, no exceptions.

46:33.999 --> 46:35.250
[sighs]

46:45.719 --> 46:48.013
Did you know Agent Petty and I dated?

46:55.604 --> 46:56.522
No.

46:58.232 --> 47:02.194
We'd been apart for a while before
Cade Langmore was hired to kill him.

47:05.322 --> 47:06.365
But still...

47:11.829 --> 47:13.288
I'm sorry for your loss.

47:14.581 --> 47:16.875
This is the point
where I'm ethically obligated to tell you

47:16.959 --> 47:18.252
that you can make a deal.

47:19.837 --> 47:21.547
I've got no reason to make a deal.

47:27.845 --> 47:29.263
I'm not sure you comprehend

47:29.388 --> 47:31.890
how poorly the cartel war is going
for Navarro,

47:32.933 --> 47:35.477
but it won't be long before all his hacks

47:35.561 --> 47:38.021
and all the petty criminals
working for you

47:38.105 --> 47:39.523
start looking for ways out.

47:40.899 --> 47:42.818
Do you think they'll be loyal to you?

47:55.831 --> 47:57.165
I find comfort

47:57.833 --> 48:00.794
in the idea of you waiting every day

48:01.545 --> 48:03.130
for that one slip-up...

48:03.839 --> 48:04.882
or betrayal.

48:08.635 --> 48:09.887
That one wild card.

49:09.529 --> 49:12.282
[Frank Jr.] What the fuck? Oh, come on.

49:12.366 --> 49:14.326
Come on.
You really trying to sweat me like that?

49:14.409 --> 49:15.869
-[dealer] Sir.
-[laughs]

49:15.953 --> 49:18.163
Hey, hey, I'm fucking talking to you.

49:19.581 --> 49:21.583
You really think you're gonna bluff me
on a flush?

49:21.667 --> 49:25.128
I'm sorry, there's no swearing
and addressing others at the table.

49:26.129 --> 49:27.506
How much we got there, dealer?

49:30.217 --> 49:31.301
Nineteen thousand.

49:31.760 --> 49:34.054
Okay, 19. That's fine with me.

49:34.388 --> 49:36.306
I don't give a fuck about that.

49:36.390 --> 49:38.892
Got your 19,000
right up your ass here, pal.

49:51.363 --> 49:53.740
[Frank Jr.] You think this makes you
some kind of fucking genius?

49:54.241 --> 49:55.951
Asshole! Look at me.

49:56.034 --> 49:57.077
[Ruth] Get him out of here.

50:01.957 --> 50:03.250
You sure you want to do this...

50:04.584 --> 50:06.169
with everything I know about you?

50:09.840 --> 50:12.384
-Get him the fuck out of here.
-[man] Sir.

50:27.941 --> 50:31.194

[sighs]

50:52.340 --> 50:53.884
[cell phone ringing]

51:10.942 --> 51:12.194
What did he say?

51:13.445 --> 51:15.489
[Wendy]
<i>I'm standing in front of our old house.</i>

51:18.450 --> 51:19.951
Really?<i> </i>How does it look?

51:21.495 --> 51:24.247
-[Wendy] Same house, different family.
-[chattering]

51:27.125 --> 51:28.168
It's a good house.

51:29.544 --> 51:30.504
It was.

51:30.921 --> 51:32.923
[car doors shutting]

51:39.137 --> 51:40.806
You gonna make me ask you again?

51:43.809 --> 51:45.769
Navarro called Helen an hour ago.

51:45.852 --> 51:47.062
He likes the plan.

51:48.563 --> 51:50.273
<i>It doesn't mean we're obligated.</i>

51:53.443 --> 51:54.486
Yes, it does.

51:58.073 --> 51:59.574
[sighs]

52:00.617 --> 52:01.868
<i>Are you still there?</i>

52:03.745 --> 52:05.705
-I gotta go.
-[clicks]

52:37.487 --> 52:38.572
[soft metal jingle]

53:10.520 --> 53:11.855
[Frank Jr.] <i>You embarrassed me.</i>

53:19.696 --> 53:21.823
How the fuck did you get back in here?

53:21.907 --> 53:24.117
It's a poker game. People talk shit.

53:24.201 --> 53:28.246
This time, you're gonna get the fuck out,
and you're gonna stay the fuck out.

53:28.622 --> 53:31.208
-Sit tight.
-Do you know what your problem is?

53:32.500 --> 53:33.585
Gee, tell me.

53:33.960 --> 53:36.755
Your problem is
you're just playing dress-up.

53:37.464 --> 53:38.798
And you know it.

53:39.216 --> 53:43.053
-[thunder rumbles]
-I put this game together all by myself,

53:43.136 --> 53:45.889
and you fucked it up
because you can't bluff well enough

53:45.972 --> 53:47.432
to pretend like <i>you</i> belong.

53:48.808 --> 53:50.560
You're a fucking bitch.

53:50.644 --> 53:55.774
And you're a low-rent daddy's boy
who can't even pay to get respect.

53:56.441 --> 53:58.109
I should fucking kill you.

54:00.237 --> 54:01.446
Come get you some.
