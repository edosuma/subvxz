It's been a while since
we had one of these talks.

00:18.240 --> 00:19.560
Don't say it.

00:19.640 --> 00:20.960
I know.

00:21.080 --> 00:24.357
I'm the one who does
most of the talking.

00:24.440 --> 00:28.559
I'll try to keep it short,
but you're up late anyway,

I get you up to speed.

It wasn't that long ago we were

But it's not like that anymore.

01:02.560 --> 01:04.596
We're building.

We're still ready to deal with

Sure.

01:23.280 --> 01:27.194
We're getting back
a piece of who we used to be,

01:27.280 --> 01:30.875
how things were before all this.

01:33.320 --> 01:36.995
It's all happening.

02:48.120 --> 02:49.679
The work you've done here.

02:49.760 --> 02:53.719
Someday you'll cross this bridge
with your grandchildren

02:53.800 --> 02:56.553
and tell them the story
of how it was built.

02:56.640 --> 02:58.711
I'm not gonna bore my grandkids

02:58.800 --> 03:00.518
telling them a story about a bridge.

03:00.600 --> 03:02.716
[Chuckles] It's not just a bridge.

03:02.800 --> 03:05.110
Roads are the lifeblood of civilization.

03:05.200 --> 03:07.794

Uh, one other thing.

03:40.240 --> 03:42.231
Did he get taller?

03:42.320 --> 03:43.958
I think he's taller.

03:44.040 --> 03:46.236
He'll be off to college

03:48.840 --> 03:51.150
If the Kingdom didn't need me

03:51.240 --> 03:53.356

03:53.440 --> 03:56.353
I'd stay here to drive in

Oh?

03:58.240 --> 04:00.516
That'd be the only reason you'd stay?

04:00.600 --> 04:03.160
There might be one other.

Mm?

04:09.080 --> 04:11.799
Sanctuary's not ready yet.

04:11.880 --> 04:14.793
So I'll be heading back there after.

04:21.720 --> 04:24.792
Fairy tales end with heroes

04:24.880 --> 04:26.837
but in the real world, in this world,

04:26.920 --> 04:30.276
it's about finding the small moments...

04:30.360 --> 04:33.512
and getting to have as many of
those moments as possible.

04:35.160 --> 04:39.597
This is just good-bye for now.
I'm not giving up on the fairy tale.

04:39.680 --> 04:42.274
Hell, no.

04:44.200 --> 04:46.396
In regards to our makeshift
levee upstream,

04:46.480 --> 04:48.198
given the current rate of spring runoff,

04:48.280 --> 04:51.636
I'd put its expiration date
at another six to nine days.

After that it's slam blam,

04:53.880 --> 04:55.712

those supports ready?

04:55.800 --> 04:57.199
Well, ditto on the six to nine,

and shed the lead,

- I think we can beat it.
- Good.

07:19.600 --> 07:21.193
Well, it's still not here.

Yeah. Jesus mentioned that.

07:22.840 --> 07:25.195
- I don't know what happened.
- They could be lying.

07:25.280 --> 07:26.873
I don't think they are.

07:26.960 --> 07:29.998
Maybe the guys
who made the delivery

07:30.080 --> 07:34.358
were taken down by walkers
or they went AWOL, but...

07:34.440 --> 07:36.192
we need the food.

send enough to tide them over

07:42.520 --> 07:43.749
We have the surpluses.

07:43.840 --> 07:45.239
Yeah, but for how long?

07:45.320 --> 07:46.958
Till we get that fuel...

07:48.880 --> 07:51.599
...that tractor's not moving...

07:51.680 --> 07:53.990
which means
the big fields don't get plowed

07:54.080 --> 07:55.639
and the yield comes in short.

07:55.720 --> 07:57.870
What about the plow
we brought back from the museum?

07:57.960 --> 07:59.598
I need a blacksmith to fix it,

deal with something like this.

08:11.160 --> 08:13.037
It might be time, then,

08:13.120 --> 08:15.270
to start talking about
making some rules.

08:15.360 --> 08:18.716
Do you think he'd ever
do something like this again?

08:18.800 --> 08:20.313
I didn't think that he'd do it
the first time.

08:20.400 --> 08:21.754
Well, you didn't hang him
like you did Gregory.

08:21.840 --> 08:23.114
There must be a reason for that.

08:23.200 --> 08:25.032
So, should I let him walk
like nothing happened?

08:25.120 --> 08:26.713
No.

08:26.800 --> 08:31.271
I hate what he did to you, to Enid.

08:31.360 --> 08:33.431
But if keeping him locked up

08:33.520 --> 08:35.033
means that the crops
don't get planted,

08:35.120 --> 08:36.633
then it's not just him
that gets punished.

08:36.720 --> 08:38.836
Uh, Hilltop will be fine.

08:38.919 --> 08:41.275
Until that ethanol shows up,

08:41.360 --> 08:42.634
we're holding on to our surpluses

11:55.440 --> 11:57.477
It won't be, not for a while,

11:57.560 --> 11:59.471
but it's not about forgetting.

11:59.560 --> 12:03.190
It's about moving ahead,
all of us, together.

12:03.280 --> 12:04.839
We keep doing that,

12:04.920 --> 12:08.470
they'll see we're all on the same side.

12:08.560 --> 12:10.198
Are we, though?

12:13.320 --> 12:15.197
Are we on the same side, Rick?

12:15.280 --> 12:17.590
Well, you tell me.

12:17.680 --> 12:20.069
Thing is, man, I've been tryin' to.

12:20.160 --> 12:22.800
But you don't seem to want to hear it.

12:25.000 --> 12:28.994
Daryl. [sighs]

12:29.080 --> 12:31.640
It's complicated.

12:31.720 --> 12:34.758
It's been different since Gregory,

12:34.840 --> 12:36.797
maybe since before that.

12:36.880 --> 12:39.235
You should talk to him.

12:41.160 --> 12:43.071
And say what?

12:45.760 --> 12:48.115
I get what you're trying to do here,

12:48.200 --> 12:49.838
and it's the right thing.

12:49.920 --> 12:51.672
But maybe for some of them,

12:51.760 --> 12:53.478
they're just not ready for it.

13:04.240 --> 13:07.119
Tammy: You can't just
keep him from me like this.

13:07.200 --> 13:09.510
She won't even say
how long he's in there for.

13:09.640 --> 13:10.914
Why won't you help me?

13:11.000 --> 13:12.877
Jesus: I can't let you go down there,

13:12.960 --> 13:15.236
-not without Maggie's okay.
- He's my husband.

13:15.320 --> 13:16.754
You have to let me see him.

13:16.840 --> 13:18.399
Of course you're going to see him,

13:18.480 --> 13:19.834
but we can't do this today.

13:19.920 --> 13:21.115
So, if not today, when?

13:21.200 --> 13:22.554
I deserve a damn answer.

13:22.640 --> 13:24.313
- Tammy, please. I'm not--
- No. Tell me.

13:24.400 --> 13:26.357
Tell me when I get to see
my damn husband!

13:26.440 --> 13:27.669
Tammy, I'm sorry.

13:27.760 --> 13:29.910
Look, my boy is dead.

13:30.000 --> 13:31.399
My husband is locked up.

13:31.480 --> 13:33.153
Nobody even talks to me anymore

13:33.240 --> 13:35.436
'cause they don't know
what the hell to say.

13:35.520 --> 13:37.716
I don't have much,
but I've still got rights.

13:37.800 --> 13:40.679
Are you gonna take those
away from me, too?

13:40.760 --> 13:42.558
He tried to kill Maggie.

13:42.640 --> 13:44.790
He tried to kill her, Tammy.

13:45.920 --> 13:49.675
Just give her a little bit
to figure it out.

13:49.760 --> 13:51.797
All right. All right.

13:51.880 --> 13:55.157
But you tell her that I am not moving

13:55.240 --> 13:57.151
until she lets me in there.

13:57.240 --> 14:00.471
You go. Go ahead and tell her that.

14:00.560 --> 14:02.153
I got no one else.

14:02.240 --> 14:05.153
I got no place else to be, okay?

14:19.480 --> 14:21.198
Are you gonna talk to her about it?

14:21.280 --> 14:22.998
Maggie?

14:23.080 --> 14:24.798
She'll do what she wants to do.

14:24.880 --> 14:26.200
But what do you think?

14:26.280 --> 14:28.476
I think it's not my call.

14:28.560 --> 14:30.790
But do you agree with it?

14:30.880 --> 14:33.190
[Sighs]

14:33.280 --> 14:35.794
I don't know if
she hanged Gregory for everyone

14:35.880 --> 14:38.793
or for herself or both.

14:38.880 --> 14:40.359
But I'm not against a grieving mother

14:40.480 --> 14:41.595
seeing her husband.

14:41.680 --> 14:43.478
Then you should talk to her.

14:43.560 --> 14:45.631
She trusts you. She listens to you.

14:45.720 --> 14:47.791
And I trust her...

14:47.880 --> 14:50.998
her instincts, if not her every decision.

14:51.080 --> 14:53.310
No one's right all the time,

14:53.400 --> 14:57.030
not her, not me, and not you.

14:57.120 --> 14:59.031
That's why we need to build something

14:59.120 --> 15:00.952
that's bigger than any one of us.

15:27.120 --> 15:28.952
[Chuckles] Yes.

15:29.040 --> 15:31.111
That's her.

15:32.760 --> 15:35.036
You're very talented.

15:39.040 --> 15:41.077

You are one of us.

15:46.520 --> 15:48.477
Thanks to you...

15:48.560 --> 15:50.676
and Rick and Morgan.

15:50.800 --> 15:52.871
You're the ones that reached out to me.

15:52.960 --> 15:55.076
The others-- mnh.

15:55.160 --> 15:57.276
The others will come around.

15:57.360 --> 15:59.636
Nobody trusted me at first, either.

15:59.720 --> 16:03.714
I gave them good reason not to.

16:03.800 --> 16:05.473
Same here.

16:05.560 --> 16:07.278
Believe me.

He's, uh...

16:11.880 --> 16:14.440
He's good like that.

He's not the only one.

Well...

16:31.400 --> 16:35.792
that's my job-- being there.

Maggie: Maybe we can vent that trailer

16:45.440 --> 16:48.558
or move the school outside
till the heat wave's over.

16:48.640 --> 16:50.677
I'll let Bertie know.

from Georgie?

17:02.120 --> 17:06.955
No. I was just reading
one of the old ones she sent.

she's done for us,

17:09.640 --> 17:11.676
how much is still left to do.

17:11.800 --> 17:13.871
You thinking about joining her?

17:13.960 --> 17:16.952
You know she'll never
get tired of asking.

17:17.040 --> 17:19.634
I like her ideas, but not that much.

17:19.720 --> 17:22.394
I'll bet she's got a killer

[Baby cooing]

17:46.800 --> 17:49.030
You think that's unfair?

17:49.120 --> 17:53.000
I think some decisions are
too big for one person to make.

17:53.080 --> 17:54.673
But that's why we used to have laws.

17:54.800 --> 17:56.154
You've been talking to Michonne.

Let 'em clear the camp,
then fire up number two

and none of the guys who
walked off made it back home.

25:29.720 --> 25:32.439
- None of them?
- No. And some of 'em had families.

25:32.520 --> 25:34.830

There's no way they just up and left them.

25:36.160 --> 25:37.719
So, what do you think is going on?

I don't know, but the Sanctuary
group's gettin' worried,

25:39.840 --> 25:41.478
and they're the only ones here
without guns, so...

25:41.600 --> 25:43.671
Yeah, well, we disarmed
Sanctuary for a reason.

Piper Two, this is

25:45.920 --> 25:47.513
There are more of them here
than from anywhere else,

25:47.600 --> 25:48.874
and they're scared.

If they wind up deciding
they're safer back home,

25:51.080 --> 25:52.309

39:32.280 --> 39:33.839
No,no,no,no.

39:33.920 --> 39:35.149
[Laughter]

39:35.240 --> 39:38.995
You still carrying that old ring around?

39:41.320 --> 39:42.549
Oh. Y-Yeah.

39:42.640 --> 39:44.039
Oh, I'm -- I'm not saying yes.

39:44.120 --> 39:45.872
I just thought I'd try it on for a while,

39:45.960 --> 39:48.395
-you know, while you're gone and--
- Whatever you say.

39:48.480 --> 39:50.073
Uh... [Clears throat]

39:50.160 --> 39:51.798
No, d-d-don't. Don't.

39:53.040 --> 39:54.314
Oh, come on.

39:54.400 --> 39:56.710
Don't. I'm not kidding.

39:56.800 --> 39:59.155
But I...

39:59.240 --> 40:01.390
I wrote a speech.

40:02.520 --> 40:04.511
I'm sure you did.

40:04.600 --> 40:07.513
And you can read it to me later.

40:07.600 --> 40:11.833
[Fire crackling]

40:19.360 --> 40:22.910
[Chuckles]

40:23.000 --> 40:25.719
[Conversations continue]

40:29.280 --> 40:31.669
Rick: It was a hard day.

40:35.640 --> 40:38.871
Hardest we've had in awhile.

40:38.960 --> 40:42.351
A man lost his arm.

40:42.440 --> 40:45.000
Project's behind schedule.

40:45.080 --> 40:46.753
[Inhales deeply]

40:46.880 --> 40:51.192
People were at each other's throats.

40:51.280 --> 40:54.989
Thing is, though, bad as it was...

40:55.080 --> 40:58.596
when the day was done...

40:58.680 --> 41:01.593
they came together.

41:01.680 --> 41:07.198
Not all of 'em, but enough.

41:07.280 --> 41:12.195
They chose to be together.

41:12.320 --> 41:16.234
You see what I'm getting at?

41:16.320 --> 41:19.233
No matter what happens,

41:19.320 --> 41:24.599
it's human nature to come together.

41:24.680 --> 41:28.036
That's just what we do.

41:28.120 --> 41:30.031
Negan: [Scoffs]

41:30.120 --> 41:33.954
That's a real pretty picture
you paint there, Rick.

41:35.560 --> 41:37.995
When do I get to see it?

41:38.080 --> 41:40.037
Never.

41:40.120 --> 41:43.112
You're gonna die behind these bars.

41:43.200 --> 41:44.634
You know that.

41:44.720 --> 41:48.873
Well, then, don't I get
some kind of final request?

41:48.960 --> 41:50.439
Why don't you bring me--

41:50.520 --> 41:52.079
Don't you ever get tired

41:52.160 --> 41:54.720
of acting like you're still in charge?

41:54.800 --> 41:57.269
<i>Do you?</i>

41:57.360 --> 42:00.830
You think just 'cause
they had a little weenie roast

42:00.920 --> 42:03.355
that you've got all this on lock?

42:05.960 --> 42:10.272
When it finally goes to shit--
and it will--

42:10.360 --> 42:12.636
you make sure you come back

42:12.720 --> 42:15.439
and you tell me all about that day, too.

42:15.520 --> 42:19.878
We're thriving without you,

42:19.960 --> 42:24.875
building a future,
just like I said we would.

42:24.960 --> 42:27.270
Building it for who?

42:27.360 --> 42:29.590
For Carl?

42:32.960 --> 42:36.430
You don't speak his name.

42:36.520 --> 42:41.469
Your family's gone, Rick, same as mine.

42:41.560 --> 42:45.474
That bridge-- it's not the future.

42:45.560 --> 42:48.712
It's a monument to the dead.

42:50.760 --> 42:53.479
[Sighs]

42:53.560 --> 42:57.599
You're not saving the world, Rick.

42:57.720 --> 43:00.997
You're just gettin' it ready for me.

43:05.080 --> 43:08.118
[Crickets chirping]

43:10.840 --> 43:15.710
[Helicopter blades whirring]

43:43.640 --> 43:46.917
[Crickets chirping]

43:51.080 --> 43:53.549
[Liquid swishing]

44:07.360 --> 44:09.749
[Bottle clinks, thuds]

44:09.840 --> 44:11.831
[Sniffles]

44:11.960 --> 44:14.190
[Twig snaps]

44:14.280 --> 44:18.797
[Metal scrapes]

44:18.880 --> 44:20.917
Christ.
You damn near got yourself killed.

44:21.000 --> 44:22.673
What the hell are you--
