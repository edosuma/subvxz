00:21.396 --> 00:23.982
- I just kept repeating over and over.
- Find her.

00:23.982 --> 00:26.359
I miss him
every single second of every day.

00:26.359 --> 00:27.277
I'm here for you.

00:27.277 --> 00:30.488
What's the Registry gonna do with me
when they find out that I'm pregnant?

00:30.488 --> 00:31.614
Angelina, you're alive?

00:31.614 --> 00:34.242
We always find a way to each other.
We're connected, Cal.

00:34.242 --> 00:35.952
We have absolutely no idea where she is.

00:35.952 --> 00:37.871
It'd be nice if a Calling could help us.

00:37.871 --> 00:40.498
I think I did it. DNA has no anomaly.

00:40.498 --> 00:42.751
[Ben] What little lesson do you think
Daly brought back?

00:42.751 --> 00:45.128
If anything,
we know no one returns empty-handed.

00:45.128 --> 00:46.755
- [Olive] Is that--
- [Cal] Fiona Clarke.

00:46.755 --> 00:48.798
I found her hiding
in a barn by an apple orchard.

00:50.467 --> 00:52.177
[Olive] <i>She returned twice, just like you.</i>

00:52.677 --> 00:55.764

- [Cal] <i>Yeah, but what is it?</i>

00:55.764 --> 00:57.557
[suspenseful music plays]

01:06.775 --> 01:08.651
How could this even happen?

01:09.444 --> 01:11.029
I thought we saved Fiona.

01:12.739 --> 01:13.782
You saved her.

01:15.408 --> 01:16.451
I let her die.

01:17.535 --> 01:20.288
It was on my watch. I fell asleep. I--

01:20.288 --> 01:21.706
Hey. Hey, no.

01:21.706 --> 01:24.834
Ol, if it's anyone's fault, it's mine.

01:24.834 --> 01:27.253
A Calling led me to her to keep her safe.

01:27.253 --> 01:28.546
I failed.

01:29.172 --> 01:32.383
It's just that straw was secure.

01:32.383 --> 01:34.177
I don't know how it fell out.

01:34.177 --> 01:35.178
I don't know.

01:36.554 --> 01:38.765
- I don't know, but we must call someone--
- No. No, no.

01:38.765 --> 01:41.601
We can't. We have to think this through.

01:41.601 --> 01:45.688
Last night, Saanvi said she'd send help.
Let's... Let's just sit tight.

01:46.314 --> 01:48.691
No calls. No risk of unwanted attention.

01:48.691 --> 01:51.319
I wish Dad was here. He'd... He'd be--

01:51.319 --> 01:54.405
Disappointed... in me.

01:56.157 --> 01:57.992
[Eden] Olive? Cal? I'm hungry.

01:57.992 --> 02:00.078

[Ben] I used to sing that to my twins
to wake 'em up in the morning.

02:16.469 --> 02:18.972
It's nice that a flower can't reply
with a groan.

02:18.972 --> 02:21.808
My mama always said,
"Start your day with a song."

02:21.808 --> 02:23.643
So I do that for my flowers.

02:24.144 --> 02:27.939
They seem so alive. It's hard to believe
you grew it in this place.

02:27.939 --> 02:29.149
Managed to get the bulb.

02:30.066 --> 02:32.652
Give it a little light on the yard
every day after breakfast.

02:33.319 --> 02:35.738
Seeing it grow gives me hope.

02:36.322 --> 02:37.157

All righty. The ultrasound is showing
that your amniotic fluid is running low.

03:19.449 --> 03:22.327
It's nothing to worry about,
but let's focus on hydration

03:22.327 --> 03:24.120
and keep this bun in the oven longer.

03:24.120 --> 03:26.289
Sounds easy enough. Thanks.

You're welcome. Baby looks healthy.

[Jared sighs]

03:53.149 --> 03:54.025
Go ahead.

03:55.735 --> 03:57.362
Mick, yesterday, that kiss...

03:58.029 --> 04:00.031
I mean, almost kiss.

04:01.366 --> 04:03.284
- What I'm trying to say here is--
- Hey.

04:04.410 --> 04:05.954
Forget it. It never happened.

04:05.954 --> 04:06.955

Oh my God. Is this Angelina?

04:22.553 --> 04:23.638
Mm-hmm.

04:23.638 --> 04:26.891
I don't understand. Ben thought
he saw her die in the church fire.

04:26.891 --> 04:28.768
She's like a cockroach. Just--

We're gonna find her, Mick.

- Okay, if there's anything I can do, just...
- I'll keep you posted. Promise.

Hey, blue eyes.

04:47.328 --> 04:49.122
[Michaela] Zeke, where have you been?

04:49.998 --> 04:51.958
I have so much to tell you. I'm--

04:54.335 --> 04:56.462
I'm guessing you already know it all.

04:58.256 --> 04:59.590
Is everything okay?

05:00.258 --> 05:02.510
I told you in my vows
we'd never have enough time together,

05:02.510 --> 05:06.639
yet we got more time
than we ever dreamed possible.

05:06.639 --> 05:09.434
The universe is, um, full of surprises.

05:10.184 --> 05:13.521
I live for the moments
where I can just be here with you.

05:18.568 --> 05:21.070
Yeah, maybe we would've had more time
if I would've been stronger.

05:21.070 --> 05:24.991
Zeke, don't say that.
Your big beautiful heart saved Cal's life.

05:24.991 --> 05:27.118
And others. You've helped so many people.

05:27.118 --> 05:30.413
That was my way of redeeming myself
for Chloe, for my parents' heartache.

05:31.706 --> 05:32.790
Piling on the pain.

05:33.958 --> 05:37.545
I couldn't forgive myself. I couldn't meet
my redemption in the middle.

05:38.546 --> 05:39.881
Don't make the same mistake, Mick.

05:41.716 --> 05:43.426
- You did nothing wrong.
- [Zeke] Mick, listen.

05:44.552 --> 05:47.638
- I'll be gone soon, and you have--
- What are you talking about?

05:47.638 --> 05:50.808
You have important work to do.
People who need you.

05:51.476 --> 05:53.644
- The world needs you.
- I need you.

05:54.896 --> 05:57.857
Zeke, you can choose to stay with me.

05:57.857 --> 06:01.903
I wish I could, my love, but I can't.

06:02.487 --> 06:05.281
You need to be out in the world

Wherever it takes you.

06:14.957 --> 06:16.667
It's time to move forward now.

- Without me.
- I don't want to move forward without you.

Zimmer approved your request,
so here's Daly's son.

07:00.128 --> 07:02.713
I don't know why you even bother.
His dad's a killer.

07:02.713 --> 07:04.674
- My guys had families too.
- Okay.

07:07.218 --> 07:09.178
Thank you, Patrick, for coming in.

07:09.178 --> 07:10.805
Didn't exactly have a choice.

07:11.889 --> 07:13.391
I don't understand why I'm here.

07:13.391 --> 07:15.726
Well, uh, Captain Daly,

07:16.477 --> 07:18.479
your dad, he's alive.

07:19.856 --> 07:20.731
And he's here.

07:21.774 --> 07:23.943
- How's that possible?
- [Saanvi] I'm not sure.

07:23.943 --> 07:29.240
But he came back again, and this time...
he brought something with him.

07:29.824 --> 07:30.783
What do you mean?

07:31.742 --> 07:33.786
It's difficult to explain,

07:33.786 --> 07:38.624
but the detention center is experiencing
something like mythological plagues.

07:38.624 --> 07:40.918
And somehow, they come from your dad.

07:41.586 --> 07:43.379
And we've been really lucky so far

07:43.379 --> 07:46.090
because we've been able
to keep it contained it to the building.

07:46.591 --> 07:48.050
Oh. Great.

07:48.050 --> 07:51.387
I wouldn't put you in danger, but I do
think you may be the key to the cure.

07:51.387 --> 07:54.724
Because you and your dad share
the same genetic material,

07:54.724 --> 07:56.851
your healthy stem cells, your bone marrow,

07:56.851 --> 08:00.980
may be the secret sauce
to solve the mystery created by your dad.

08:00.980 --> 08:03.149
And this could be a chance
to save some lives.

08:04.400 --> 08:07.111
Yeah. I still can't believe
he's actually here.

08:09.030 --> 08:09.947
Can I show you?

08:18.039 --> 08:19.832
[Patrick] Jesus Christ.

08:21.209 --> 08:22.043
It is him.

08:25.046 --> 08:29.175
I think if he knew that you were here,
he'd be really grateful.

08:30.218 --> 08:33.054
I've been estranged from my old man
since long before 828.

08:33.930 --> 08:36.182
He hurt my mom, me.

08:37.058 --> 08:38.100
So many people.

The poor woman that he kidnapped
and took on the plane.

08:41.979 --> 08:44.690

that I was better off without him.

[Patrick] Yes.

09:20.434 --> 09:21.727
This must be another plague.

09:21.727 --> 09:23.604
And you think I can help stop this?

09:23.604 --> 09:27.775
I think you're the only one that can help.
I know this is a big ask, but please!

09:28.276 --> 09:29.944

09:45.543 --> 09:48.087
But it can't be. I saw her die, Mick.

09:50.006 --> 09:53.009
It is Angelina. Of course she survives.

09:53.009 --> 09:55.428

that she be gone for good?

Luckily, the guards
were distracted by this--

12:13.899 --> 12:14.859
Blood plague.

12:14.859 --> 12:18.279
I've tested samples from the facility.
They all have Daly's DNA on them.

12:18.279 --> 12:19.822
And Daly, how is he? Is he safe?

12:19.822 --> 12:23.451
I mean, his room's secure,
but his IV fluid turned to blood.

12:23.451 --> 12:25.327
His sedation's gonna start wearing off.

12:25.327 --> 12:28.080
With a mask like that,
he'll be terrified when he wakes up.

12:28.080 --> 12:30.207
Look, I have a jump-start to the cure.

12:30.207 --> 12:33.127
I figured out a way to eliminate Callings
with that serum I made.

12:33.127 --> 12:36.088
Come on. That nearly killed you
when you tried it on yourself.

12:36.088 --> 12:38.758
Right, which is why I've brought him.

12:39.759 --> 12:41.051
Daly's son, Patrick.

12:42.261 --> 12:43.596
- He actually came?
- [Saanvi] Yeah.

12:45.139 --> 12:47.892
He's clearly having a hard time,
but he's agreed to help us.

12:47.892 --> 12:50.019
And with a little bit of luck,
I can modify the serum

12:50.019 --> 12:53.355
to disconnect Daly from, I don't know,
whatever this is and stop the plagues.

12:54.106 --> 12:56.275
And then we can finally get
some answers from Daly.

12:57.568 --> 12:59.987
And maybe give him a chance
to heal the rift with his son.

13:02.114 --> 13:03.240
[sighs]

13:13.793 --> 13:15.586
[Olive] No, no, no, no! Eden, stop.

13:16.754 --> 13:19.089
- You're gonna disturb her.
- I wanna see her.

13:19.673 --> 13:20.925
I'm sorry. Um...

13:21.967 --> 13:23.219
Fiona is really sick.

13:23.803 --> 13:26.555
But I helped her last night.
Just like Olive told me.

13:27.890 --> 13:28.891
What? Uh...

13:30.476 --> 13:32.228
How? Helped her how?

13:32.228 --> 13:36.023
You said the splinter was hurting her
and told me to take it out.

13:36.023 --> 13:38.484
No. No, Eden, I never said that.

13:38.484 --> 13:40.319
Yes. Yes, you did.

13:40.945 --> 13:43.197
You said she'd feel better,
and she's still sick.

13:46.742 --> 13:47.701
[Olive sighs]

13:49.537 --> 13:50.704
I was asleep.

13:51.622 --> 13:52.957
I never spoke to Eden.

13:56.794 --> 13:59.129
Yeah. No, I appreciate it. Thanks.

13:59.129 --> 14:01.006
Nice when agencies collaborate.

14:01.507 --> 14:04.510
It doesn't hurt when our suspect's wanted
for kidnapping and murder

14:04.510 --> 14:06.178
with a fat bounty on her head.

14:06.178 --> 14:08.639
Here we go. Toll cam, eastbound I-80.

14:08.639 --> 14:12.476
It's the same van, same hat,
but the angle's a bit better. Zoom in.

14:13.435 --> 14:14.979
Oh, that is definitely her.

14:14.979 --> 14:16.438
She keeps up this pace,

14:16.438 --> 14:19.984
she'll hit the GW Bridge
in about three hours.

14:20.651 --> 14:22.027
Putting her in New York.

14:22.027 --> 14:24.864
[scoffs] Why is she
running straight into the storm?

14:24.864 --> 14:28.200
Only two reasons. She's running
from something or towards something.

14:29.034 --> 14:31.412
Maybe Eden.
I mean, she's gone after her before.

14:31.412 --> 14:35.749
Let's roll. And it'll give us a chance
to move Fiona to the safe house.

14:37.418 --> 14:39.253
[horn honks]

14:40.713 --> 14:42.715
[mysterious music plays]

14:47.219 --> 14:49.346
[mystical whirring]

15:11.160 --> 15:12.411
That wasn't so bad.

15:12.411 --> 15:15.080
You're gonna be numb
and unable to walk for a while.

15:15.080 --> 15:17.082
- Okay?
- Okay.

15:20.210 --> 15:21.045
[clears throat]

15:22.963 --> 15:23.964
Oh.

15:24.673 --> 15:25.507
What's that?

15:25.507 --> 15:28.928
So this is a needle that I need to use
in order to extract your bone marrow.

15:29.595 --> 15:31.013
It looks more like an ice pick.

15:33.265 --> 15:37.269
Thanks for doing this. I know it can't
be easy seeing your dad like that.

15:37.269 --> 15:42.149
I've had my share of hurt from my dad,
but what he's doing to everyone here...

15:42.149 --> 15:43.651
[Ben] Yeah, I know your dad.

15:43.651 --> 15:47.655
Not well, but enough to know
that he hasn't been a saint.

15:48.864 --> 15:52.451
He's got a lot of guilt around 828,
which wasn't his fault.

15:52.451 --> 15:54.828
And I don't think
these plagues are either.

15:54.828 --> 15:56.997
[Patrick] Wish those were his only sins.

15:56.997 --> 15:58.582
Infidelity, check.

15:58.582 --> 16:01.377
Blaming everyone else
for his problems, always.

16:02.127 --> 16:04.129
And then wash it down
with a bottle of gin.

16:05.673 --> 16:10.594
As a dad who's made
his fair share of mistakes

16:10.594 --> 16:13.472
and who manages to still make more,

16:14.348 --> 16:18.686
I've learned that it's not on my kids
to be my cleanup crew.

16:19.603 --> 16:21.397
I'm trying to be a better dad.

16:23.232 --> 16:25.693
And their forgiveness

16:26.902 --> 16:28.278
means the world to me.

16:28.278 --> 16:31.115
My guess is you haven't pulled
half the stunts he's pulled.

16:32.199 --> 16:35.119
But you're both here now,
so it could be an opportunity to

16:36.245 --> 16:37.287
clear the air.

16:39.832 --> 16:41.083
If you want it to be.

16:42.626 --> 16:43.794
Yeah, I don't know.

16:45.337 --> 16:48.549
- I mean, is it even safe to go in there?
- Sure, with the right precautions.

16:48.549 --> 16:51.010
And once you're stabilized
and able to walk,

16:51.510 --> 16:52.886
we can ask the guard to help.

16:57.182 --> 16:59.059
Yeah, I'll think about it.

17:02.730 --> 17:03.647
[alarm buzzing]

17:03.647 --> 17:05.774
How can they keep me from seeing Dr. Bahl?

17:05.774 --> 17:08.318
Dr. Bahl had something urgent
to do in the lab.

17:08.318 --> 17:11.113
I mean, I was a cop back in the day,
so I do have emergency train--

17:11.113 --> 17:13.115
- You said this wasn't an emergency.
- No.

17:13.115 --> 17:15.701
But the stress you're under
might be causing false labor pain.

17:15.701 --> 17:19.872
Stress! You think? I mean, a bloodbath
wasn't exactly part of my birthing plan.

17:19.872 --> 17:20.831
[chuckles]

17:21.373 --> 17:23.500
You know,
you kind of remind me of my husband.

17:23.500 --> 17:27.963
No matter how much something sucked,
he'd still find a way to make me laugh.

17:30.007 --> 17:32.092
- I'm sorry you lost him.
- [Michaela] Yeah.

17:33.969 --> 17:35.763
Yeah, he was a pretty Zen guy.

17:35.763 --> 17:37.973
- [Polly] Ooh!
- [Michaela] Um...

17:39.308 --> 17:43.103
You know, if he was here right now,
he would say something like, um,

17:43.103 --> 17:45.814
"Smell the flowers
and blow out the candles."

17:46.982 --> 17:50.402
"Go to your happy place.
Uh, think of someone you love."

17:50.402 --> 17:52.988
[screams]

17:55.032 --> 17:56.658
- Okay.
- This baby's coming now.

17:56.658 --> 17:58.952
I need Saanvi. It's too soon!

17:58.952 --> 18:01.288
- Okay. Guards! Guards!
- [Polly] It's too soon!

18:03.040 --> 18:04.416
We need a doctor!

18:05.042 --> 18:06.001
[Polly screams]

18:06.001 --> 18:09.922
[woman over P.A.] <i>All passengers
must return to their quarters immediately.</i>

18:09.922 --> 18:11.632
<i>This is a lockdown.</i>

18:12.257 --> 18:13.425
[alarm buzzing]

18:17.012 --> 18:21.225
I mean, Eden fully believes
that she talked to me about Fiona.

18:21.225 --> 18:23.644
But she didn't, so what the hell happened?

18:23.644 --> 18:26.313
[cartoon music playing]

18:26.313 --> 18:29.691
The baby monitor.
It could have recorded something.

18:29.691 --> 18:31.610
- The app's on my phone.
- Oh.

18:34.321 --> 18:36.031
Should be around here.

18:41.161 --> 18:42.371
<i>A splinter?</i>

18:43.330 --> 18:44.915
What's Eden doing?

18:44.915 --> 18:48.043
I think she's talking to someone.

18:48.043 --> 18:49.711
But there's no one there.

18:56.593 --> 18:58.095
Oh my God, Cal. [gasps]

18:58.095 --> 18:59.972
Eden was talking to someone.

18:59.972 --> 19:02.266
Someone not actually in the room.

19:02.766 --> 19:04.768
- What if it was--
- No. No.

19:05.269 --> 19:08.355
Please don't say Angelina, okay?

19:08.355 --> 19:09.439
She's dead.

19:11.441 --> 19:13.944
What would even make you think
something like that?

19:13.944 --> 19:16.238
The Calling that led me to Fiona.

19:16.238 --> 19:18.615
Angelina was in it. Alive and well.

19:18.615 --> 19:21.743
- It's like she was expecting me.
- Why would you hide something like that?

19:21.743 --> 19:23.453
Angelina thinks we're connected.

19:23.453 --> 19:25.998
Dad thinks we're connected.
I don't want you thinking--

19:25.998 --> 19:30.586
Okay. You and me, we are connected.

19:30.586 --> 19:34.381
Our family, we're connected through love.

19:34.381 --> 19:36.758
Angelina doesn't connect with people.

19:36.758 --> 19:38.594
She manipulates them.

19:38.594 --> 19:40.804
Like she did with Dad and Mick.

19:41.471 --> 19:44.433
But to project herself to Eden... I...

19:45.100 --> 19:46.852
She must have the Omega Sapphire.

19:48.520 --> 19:52.649
Angelina was only a projection,
so she couldn't actually touch Fiona.

19:53.150 --> 19:57.029
So she had Eden do it for her.

19:57.696 --> 20:00.115
We have to protect Eden
from learning the truth

20:00.824 --> 20:03.285
and find Angelina before she kills again.

20:04.453 --> 20:07.247
I used my sapphire to project onto Saanvi.

20:07.247 --> 20:09.958
I could do it again.
This time onto Angelina.

20:09.958 --> 20:12.836
No, Cal, it's way too dangerous.

20:12.836 --> 20:14.671
I think it's the only option we have.

20:16.465 --> 20:19.218
I'm not ready for this yet.
I'm supposed to have six more weeks.

20:19.218 --> 20:20.219
Yep.

20:20.761 --> 20:21.970
[groans]

20:21.970 --> 20:23.430
All right. Okay.

20:24.556 --> 20:25.766
We got this.

20:25.766 --> 20:26.892
[Polly] Ooh.

20:28.560 --> 20:29.895
This pain has to stop.

20:29.895 --> 20:32.981
Not a doctor, but I think the only way
that's happening is if you have a baby.

20:32.981 --> 20:33.982
Mm-hmm.

20:34.900 --> 20:36.777
I used to imagine how my life would go.

20:37.361 --> 20:42.282
You find the right guy, get married.
We would buy a house. [chuckles]

20:42.282 --> 20:45.285
And then you have a baby
in a freakin' hospital.

20:45.827 --> 20:47.829
I didn't peg you for a vision-board type.

20:47.829 --> 20:49.623
I'm not, but...

20:51.500 --> 20:52.626
my boyfriend...

20:53.961 --> 20:56.129
I love him, and he should get
to hold his baby.

20:57.673 --> 20:58.966
I wish he was here.

21:00.592 --> 21:01.927
Believe me, I feel ya.

21:02.427 --> 21:03.512
[knocking]

21:04.346 --> 21:07.057
- Hey.
- Glad you made it past the guards.

21:07.057 --> 21:10.102
No one cares what the janitor's up to.
Perk of the job.

21:10.769 --> 21:14.022
But I heard the guards are looking
for your brother. You seen him?

21:14.022 --> 21:16.733
No, uh, but let me know
if you hear anything.

21:16.733 --> 21:17.818
Of course.

21:20.779 --> 21:21.905
How can I help here?

21:23.240 --> 21:24.783
We actually need some supplies.

21:24.783 --> 21:29.288
We... We need some, um, sheets, towels,
a knife or some scissors,

21:30.580 --> 21:33.333
but the real ask
is that we need some warm--

21:33.333 --> 21:35.585
- Please don't say water.
- [mumbles] Water.

21:37.462 --> 21:39.506
- I'll do what I can.
- [Michaela] Thank you.

21:42.342 --> 21:43.427
[screams]

21:43.427 --> 21:46.138
It's okay. Hold my hand. Squeeze.

21:46.847 --> 21:48.223
- Okay, just take a breath.
- Hmm.

21:48.223 --> 21:50.225
Well, you're a tougher man than me.

21:50.225 --> 21:52.769
I'm sure if your dad
could see you doing this,

21:52.769 --> 21:55.147
he'd be proud
that you wanna help other people.

21:55.147 --> 21:56.898
You're giving me too much credit.

21:56.898 --> 21:59.484
If my leg weren't numb,
I would've run out of here by now.

21:59.484 --> 22:00.902
I don't believe that for a second.

22:01.403 --> 22:04.531
You're a good dad.
Your kids are lucky to have you.

22:04.531 --> 22:06.908
That hasn't always been the case.

22:07.701 --> 22:13.206
But I think walking through the fire,
we're stronger for it today.

22:13.206 --> 22:15.459
You know, my dad had his faults,
but thanks to you,

22:15.459 --> 22:17.669
I'm remembering there were
some good times too.

22:18.628 --> 22:22.257
For my 11th birthday,
he borrowed this little Cessna 150.

22:22.257 --> 22:25.927
We just flew out
over the Atlantic all day.

22:26.762 --> 22:28.555
Watching this whale migration.

22:29.264 --> 22:30.307
Just us.

22:31.516 --> 22:32.684
Sounds incredible.

22:33.310 --> 22:35.062
- I'll never forget it.
- [door closes]

22:38.190 --> 22:41.026
Heard you were in here, Stone.
Why are you out of quarters?

22:41.026 --> 22:44.071
- We're under strict lockdown.
- [Saanvi] No, he's here on my command.

22:44.071 --> 22:46.865
I have full authorization
to do my work on Daly,

22:46.865 --> 22:49.868
which requires the DNA
of an additional male pass--

22:49.868 --> 22:53.121
If Daly makes a move out of line,
I got a permanent way to stop him.

22:53.121 --> 22:55.082
I won't wait for Zimmer to make the call.

22:57.918 --> 23:01.088
Sorry about that. There's been
a lot of tension here recently.

23:01.088 --> 23:05.175
You were right. I don't wanna waste
this chance to see my dad.

23:05.175 --> 23:08.720
- Can I talk to him before it's too late?
- Yes. Hopefully, it'll be safe soon.

23:08.720 --> 23:11.473
Last thing I need is to integrate
your healthy cells into the serum.

23:11.473 --> 23:12.891
- Okay.
- [Saanvi] All right.

23:13.517 --> 23:14.601
[sighs]

23:17.062 --> 23:18.063
[groans]

23:18.063 --> 23:22.317
Hey, stay with me. Stay with me.
Come on. Stay with me. Stay with me.

23:22.317 --> 23:25.237
- I can't do it anymore.
- You absolutely can.

23:25.237 --> 23:28.156
You've defied the odds so far.
You can do this, all right?

23:28.156 --> 23:30.200
You seem to be an expert.
How many do you have?

23:30.200 --> 23:34.329
No, no, no, I just am good under pressure,
I guess, and a pretty cool aunt.

23:35.831 --> 23:37.791
Think you can handle one more nibling?

23:38.458 --> 23:39.835
Cool aunt reporting for duty.

23:43.338 --> 23:45.632
- Sorry, no water.
- [Michaela] It's okay.

23:45.632 --> 23:48.301
- I tried.
- [Michaela] No, you did great. Thank you.

23:50.846 --> 23:51.888
Ready to have a baby?

23:51.888 --> 23:53.682
[sentimental music plays]

24:26.381 --> 24:29.551
[Polly groaning]

24:31.261 --> 24:34.764
You're doing great. I can see the head,
so you just need one more big push.

24:34.764 --> 24:36.975
- I can't.
- [Michaela] You can. You got this.

24:36.975 --> 24:38.059
You can do this. Come on.

24:38.059 --> 24:40.353
On the count of three,
we're gonna do one more.

24:40.353 --> 24:43.106
One, two, three.

24:43.607 --> 24:44.941
[yells]

24:44.941 --> 24:48.403
Good job. Good job. Good job. Good job.
You're doing great. Push. One more.

24:48.403 --> 24:50.155
[yells]

24:50.780 --> 24:53.033
[Michaela] Good job. Towels. Come on.

24:53.575 --> 24:54.409
Good job.

24:56.411 --> 24:57.370
Good job.

24:57.871 --> 24:59.664
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

25:01.708 --> 25:02.751
Okay.

25:07.255 --> 25:08.089
Come on.

25:08.089 --> 25:10.634
Hey, come on. Breathe for me. Come on.

25:10.634 --> 25:12.511
- Is something wrong?
- [Michaela] No, no.

25:12.511 --> 25:14.930
- What's wrong with my baby?
- Nothing. Nothing. Nothing.

25:14.930 --> 25:16.973
Come on. Come on. Come on.

25:16.973 --> 25:18.975
Come on. Come on, breathe for me.

25:19.559 --> 25:22.979
Come on. Come on, sweetie.
Come on. Come on.

25:23.480 --> 25:25.482
[baby cries]

25:27.275 --> 25:28.401
[Michaela sighs]

25:29.569 --> 25:30.946
[sighs]

25:30.946 --> 25:31.863
Okay.

25:32.364 --> 25:34.157
Welcome to the world, little one.

25:34.658 --> 25:38.411
This is your mommy.
Here's Mommy. This is Mommy.

25:38.411 --> 25:39.955
[crying]

25:42.624 --> 25:43.625
Hi.

25:55.470 --> 25:57.472
[suspenseful music plays]

25:58.056 --> 26:01.142
[Olive] Just remember,
if it gets to be too much, you can--

26:01.142 --> 26:02.394
I'll bail. I know.

26:02.894 --> 26:05.397
I just wish I knew
what I was walking into.

26:06.398 --> 26:07.315
Or where.

26:08.900 --> 26:10.443
[Olive] We have our plan.

26:10.443 --> 26:13.280
Just find Angelina and stop her

26:14.114 --> 26:15.574
before she hurts anyone else.

26:20.870 --> 26:22.747
[exhales]

26:25.875 --> 26:27.877
[mystical whirring]

26:33.633 --> 26:35.135
[car horn blares]

26:35.927 --> 26:37.262
[Angelina] I knew you'd come.

26:39.389 --> 26:41.725
You used Eden to murder Fiona.

26:42.267 --> 26:44.811
She's just a child! Why?

26:44.811 --> 26:46.980
Cal, I would never hurt Eden.

26:48.064 --> 26:49.733
Or you. We're on the same side.

26:51.818 --> 26:53.153
I wish that were true.

26:53.820 --> 26:56.281
You were a kind person
when I first met you.

26:56.281 --> 26:58.491
It's not too late
to find that person again.

26:58.491 --> 27:01.286
I haven't changed. I've grown.

27:01.286 --> 27:02.579
So have you.

27:03.413 --> 27:06.583
We're both anointed by God
with the sapphire.

27:06.583 --> 27:08.877
We can help to usher in
the end of this world.

27:08.877 --> 27:13.214
We can lead the chosen
past the Death Date. Start the new world.

27:14.549 --> 27:18.261
I've prayed on it. The answer is clear.
This is a good thing.

27:18.261 --> 27:21.264
The end of the world is
an awful thing to wish for.

27:21.806 --> 27:24.893
Let me help you do the right thing.
Give me the sapphire.

27:26.978 --> 27:28.813
God won't let you take it away.

27:32.275 --> 27:34.110
Think of what we could do together.

27:34.903 --> 27:37.155
Open your eyes to our potential.

27:38.782 --> 27:40.909
There is no "we," Angelina.

27:46.289 --> 27:47.207
Cal!

27:51.753 --> 27:52.629
Cal!

27:58.718 --> 28:01.388
This is not the easiest place
to be pregnant,

28:01.971 --> 28:05.266
but then, when I found out
that the baby was coming today

28:05.266 --> 28:07.894
and without Saanvi, I just--

28:08.395 --> 28:09.854
I can only imagine the fear.

28:10.480 --> 28:11.439
Yeah.

28:11.439 --> 28:14.442
But you stepped in.

28:15.110 --> 28:18.071
Helped bring this precious new life
into the world,

28:18.738 --> 28:22.367
and I... cannot thank you enough.

28:22.367 --> 28:23.868
Well, the baby looks really healthy,

28:23.868 --> 28:26.204
but we'll get her properly checked up
when we can, okay?

28:26.204 --> 28:27.163
Okay.

28:33.336 --> 28:35.213
Guess you got your wish.
Dad made it after all.

28:37.132 --> 28:38.049
You knew?

28:38.049 --> 28:42.095
A detective can sense a tell.
And the look on this man's face right now...

28:42.721 --> 28:45.140
My lips are sealed,
but there's nothing more important

28:45.140 --> 28:47.934
than being around the ones you love,
especially right now.

28:47.934 --> 28:49.269
[sighs]

28:52.522 --> 28:55.900
When Jordan and I found out
we were pregnant, it was just

28:57.652 --> 28:58.653
wonderful.

28:59.612 --> 29:02.365
That was the day
before the passengers got locked up.

29:02.949 --> 29:04.659
[Polly] And he wasn't on the plane, so...

29:05.160 --> 29:06.703
So you guys got separated.

29:07.287 --> 29:08.163
Yeah.

29:09.205 --> 29:11.207
I didn't know if I'd ever see him again.

29:12.333 --> 29:16.129
Then a month later,
I saw this handsome guy mopping the halls.

29:16.129 --> 29:18.381
[Jordan] I got the first job here I could.

29:19.466 --> 29:21.176
No way was I missing this day.

29:24.888 --> 29:25.889
And you didn't.

29:30.393 --> 29:33.480
You guys take all the time you need.
I'm gonna be on lookout, okay?

29:34.230 --> 29:35.273
[mouthing]

29:37.942 --> 29:39.194
You ready to hold her?

29:42.447 --> 29:44.574
All right, time to meet Daddy.

29:49.329 --> 29:52.165
Well, should we still name her...

29:53.750 --> 29:54.626
Chloe.

29:56.127 --> 29:57.045
Chloe.

29:59.130 --> 29:59.964
Yeah.

30:03.551 --> 30:07.347
She didn't just have Omega Sapphire.
It was embedded in her hand.

30:07.347 --> 30:08.556
Like yours.

30:09.682 --> 30:13.353
So, if you're the dragon,
then what does that make her?

30:13.978 --> 30:14.938
Dangerous.

30:14.938 --> 30:16.189
[knocking]

30:17.190 --> 30:18.858
Could that be her already?

30:19.359 --> 30:21.903
- I don't think she needs to knock.
- [knocking]

30:25.240 --> 30:26.908
It's all good, Cal. Friendlies.

30:28.159 --> 30:30.370
Oh, thank goodness you both are safe.
What about Eden?

30:30.370 --> 30:31.538
She's safe.

30:31.538 --> 30:32.831
You have water?

30:33.498 --> 30:36.000
At least the blood plague is confined
to the detention center.

30:36.000 --> 30:40.755
Another plague? Is everything okay?
Where's Dad? Aunt Mick, TJ?

30:40.755 --> 30:42.757
Look, it's rough, but they're safe, okay?

30:45.009 --> 30:48.054
Sadly, we can't say the same.

30:51.599 --> 30:54.269
My God, Fiona! But Saanvi said she was--

30:54.269 --> 30:56.813
She was okay, and then she wasn't.

30:56.813 --> 30:58.356
You should've called right away!

30:58.356 --> 31:00.733
We didn't want anybody else
finding out about this.

31:02.902 --> 31:03.778
All right.

31:04.988 --> 31:06.739
You played it safe. That was smart.

31:07.907 --> 31:08.908
All right.

31:09.701 --> 31:12.996
We'll make this okay.
We'll give her some dignity.

31:15.874 --> 31:19.002
Cal, the blood plague isn't the only thing
we should be worried about.

31:19.502 --> 31:21.713
Angelina's close.
She could be heading here at any minute.

31:21.713 --> 31:22.839
She's already been.

31:22.839 --> 31:25.049
That's impossible.
We've been tracking her progress.

31:25.049 --> 31:27.844
She was here, but not <i>here</i> here, exactly.

31:27.844 --> 31:32.891
She's capable of projecting as anyone
to any passenger or any passenger's child.

31:32.891 --> 31:36.895
She projected to Eden, manipulated her.
That's why Fiona's dead.

31:37.478 --> 31:40.315
So I projected to her,
and I found her in some sort of van.

31:41.149 --> 31:42.191
No, we know the one.

31:43.568 --> 31:46.696
Did you see anything
that can clue us into her whereabouts?

31:46.696 --> 31:49.449
A sign for the Delaware Water Gap.

31:50.116 --> 31:51.659
It said next exit.

31:51.659 --> 31:53.536
That's solid. Um...

31:55.288 --> 31:58.499
Wait. Hold on. I've been here before.
This is I-80.

31:59.083 --> 32:01.252
She was heading eastbound, so that would...

32:02.462 --> 32:04.797
- That'd put her right there.
- Yeah! That's it.

32:04.797 --> 32:07.884
Awesome. I'm on it.
Vance has got you both covered. Stay put.

32:10.219 --> 32:12.889
I wish I had more time to test,
at least make sure it's safe.

32:12.889 --> 32:15.099
I'm afraid time is the one thing
Daly's running out of.

32:15.850 --> 32:17.560
I just hope I got this right.

32:19.562 --> 32:20.563
[device beeping]

32:20.563 --> 32:21.522
[Patrick] Dad.

32:26.819 --> 32:28.613
I can hardly believe it's you.

32:30.490 --> 32:31.699
It's been so long.

32:33.534 --> 32:35.620
Not that you really ever made the effort.

32:37.121 --> 32:39.415
There was always something
more important to do.

32:41.209 --> 32:42.627
But here I am.

32:43.211 --> 32:44.420
And I'm glad I came.

32:46.631 --> 32:48.967
Because there's something
I wanna get off my chest.

32:55.556 --> 32:56.641
Look around, Dad.

32:58.893 --> 33:00.228
All of this...

33:02.063 --> 33:02.981
is your fault.

33:05.858 --> 33:07.694
Since you flew into that storm,

33:08.194 --> 33:12.448
all the passengers' pain
and suffering is on you.

33:13.825 --> 33:18.121
- They're locked up here because of you.
- [device beeping faster]

33:18.121 --> 33:21.916
Tortured by plagues coming from you.

33:24.627 --> 33:26.421
But you've always been rotten.

33:28.506 --> 33:30.049
You cheated on Mom,

33:31.134 --> 33:32.427
abandoned us.

33:33.386 --> 33:34.804
Mom hates you.

33:35.722 --> 33:38.474
I hate you.

33:39.934 --> 33:41.269
The whole world

33:42.603 --> 33:43.730
hates you.

33:43.730 --> 33:44.981
[whimpers]

33:49.318 --> 33:51.237
You deserve to die.

33:53.740 --> 33:55.867
But you know that already, don't you?

33:58.745 --> 34:00.747
[suspenseful action music plays]

34:12.967 --> 34:14.886
My dad! Something's wrong!

34:17.346 --> 34:18.723
Go, go, go, go! Go!

34:18.723 --> 34:20.266
- [beep]
- Daly, stop!

34:20.266 --> 34:24.020
<i>Daly, they are gonna shoot you. Just stop!</i>

34:24.020 --> 34:27.273
[Patrick] That's it.
Keep running, old man.

34:27.273 --> 34:28.566
Run away.

34:29.734 --> 34:31.277
That's what you're good at, right?

34:32.361 --> 34:34.322
Daly! Daly, stop!

34:34.322 --> 34:36.449
- I gotta get to him.
- No.

34:36.449 --> 34:37.492
No.

34:37.492 --> 34:38.409
[Patrick grunts]

34:38.409 --> 34:41.162
[Saanvi] No, come on. Ben's got it.
You're gonna hurt yourself.

34:41.162 --> 34:43.247
[suspenseful music plays]

34:53.132 --> 34:54.050
Go!

34:55.927 --> 34:58.846
But this time, don't come back.

34:59.514 --> 35:00.431
Ever!

35:04.185 --> 35:05.019
Do it.

35:08.606 --> 35:11.109
Get down on the ground.
Down on the ground now!

35:11.109 --> 35:14.237
No, don't shoot! Leave him alone!

35:14.237 --> 35:17.115
Down on the ground, you piece of shit!
Get down!

35:22.662 --> 35:23.871
Hands in the air!

35:24.831 --> 35:25.665
Now!

35:37.426 --> 35:38.636
For once,

35:39.554 --> 35:41.639
stand up for yourself, you coward.

35:45.935 --> 35:48.688
Get up.

35:53.192 --> 35:55.862
- Not another move, piece of shit!
- Do what he says, Bill!

35:55.862 --> 35:58.072
[Quinn] Get back on the ground,
or I'll shoot!

35:58.072 --> 36:00.283
I said get back on the ground!

36:00.283 --> 36:01.200
That's it.

36:03.077 --> 36:03.995
Own it.

36:05.371 --> 36:07.623
- [Quinn] Don't move! Get down!
- [Ben] Listen to him, Bill!

36:07.623 --> 36:08.833
Don't think about it!

36:08.833 --> 36:11.210
Let me talk to him. I can talk to him!

36:12.336 --> 36:13.171
Dad?

36:13.963 --> 36:15.840
[Ben] Please, Bill, stay where you are!

36:15.840 --> 36:18.176
I'm so sorry. Please help me.

36:18.176 --> 36:20.136
[Quinn] One more step, and I'll shoot.

36:22.972 --> 36:24.974
- [gunshot]
- [grunts]

36:24.974 --> 36:26.100
No!

36:27.310 --> 36:28.895
Hands in the air!

36:28.895 --> 36:29.979
Now!

Hands in the air!

36:36.652 --> 36:38.321
[Ben panting]

36:38.321 --> 36:42.158
No, hang in there.
Hang in there, Bill. Help's on the way.

36:43.492 --> 36:44.994
Help's on the way, buddy.

36:46.329 --> 36:49.457
I don't wanna die.

36:50.833 --> 36:51.834
My son...

36:55.087 --> 36:58.049
No, no, no, no, stay with me.
Stay with me, please.

36:59.467 --> 37:00.301
Patrick.

37:01.719 --> 37:03.846
He loves you, all right?

37:03.846 --> 37:05.348
He wants to see you.

37:05.348 --> 37:06.599
He needs you.

37:07.433 --> 37:09.143
Hey. We all need you.

37:12.146 --> 37:13.314
No, no, no.

37:25.284 --> 37:26.661
What the hell did you just do?

37:27.245 --> 37:28.704
The two witnesses are dead.

37:29.205 --> 37:32.250
This world will end, but the chosen
can follow me. They can survive.

37:32.250 --> 37:34.627
You know what? I've heard enough.
You're coming in.

37:36.379 --> 37:41.259
Wait. No. No, I won't go.
I still have work to do. I can save lives!

37:41.259 --> 37:43.552
[Jared] You're under arrest
for the murder of Grace Stone

37:43.552 --> 37:45.221
and the kidnapping of Eden Stone.

37:45.221 --> 37:46.931
Should I go on? Get in.

37:54.855 --> 37:56.774
[line ringing]

37:56.774 --> 37:59.235
[Vance] <i>Made it back.
I'm here with Ben and Saanvi.</i>

37:59.235 --> 38:00.194
Copy.

38:00.194 --> 38:02.154
Tell me you found Angelina.

38:02.154 --> 38:03.531
[Jared] <i>Oh, I got her.</i>

38:03.531 --> 38:04.740
Oh, thank God.

38:04.740 --> 38:09.161
<i>Yeah, she's got this wild theory
that Daly and Fiona are two witnesses?</i>

38:09.161 --> 38:11.998
I just texted over a sum
of Angelina's intel on the DC.

38:13.082 --> 38:15.084
<i>I'm pretty sure Daly was her next target.</i>

38:15.793 --> 38:16.752
He's dead.

38:18.129 --> 38:19.130
Daly's dead.

38:19.839 --> 38:20.715
Damn it!

38:21.507 --> 38:24.135
Cal says she can project as other people
to the passengers,

38:24.135 --> 38:26.220
<i>but how can a projection kill Daly?</i>

38:28.681 --> 38:31.225
Wait. This guard Angelina circled.
I recognize her.

38:32.601 --> 38:34.729
That guard had it out
with the supervisors.

38:34.729 --> 38:37.231
Pretty unceremonious dismissal
a few days ago.

38:37.231 --> 38:39.191
No, she was in my lab today.

38:42.194 --> 38:43.612
What, you didn't see her?

38:43.612 --> 38:45.406
No, it was just you, me, and Patrick.

38:47.992 --> 38:50.202
I think Angelina used me to get to Daly.

38:50.202 --> 38:51.370
[Ben] <i>All right, fill me in.</i>

[Saanvi] <i>Angelina projected herself,</i>

38:53.622 --> 38:56.959
stood right there,
and listened to everything we said.

39:01.422 --> 39:02.965
We can ask the guard to help.

39:07.762 --> 39:08.971
Oh my God.

39:10.056 --> 39:14.518
That's why Daly said "my son" as he died.
He saw Patrick in the room with him.

39:15.394 --> 39:18.397
Angelina used whatever she learned
from Patrick in the lab

39:18.397 --> 39:20.941
to project herself as him
and drive Daly out of the room.

39:20.941 --> 39:22.318
Knowing he'd be shot.

39:23.611 --> 39:24.695
She's diabolical.

39:28.366 --> 39:29.658
Okay, so now what?

39:29.658 --> 39:33.371
We have Angelina,
but we need to shut her down.

39:34.914 --> 39:36.082
For good.

39:42.797 --> 39:44.298
[mystical whir]

39:52.014 --> 39:52.848
[Michaela] Zeke?

39:54.350 --> 39:56.602
Zeke, I'm here. I'm here.

39:57.478 --> 39:58.479
Who are you?

39:59.855 --> 40:02.274
Please remember me. Please.

40:02.274 --> 40:03.484
Remember us.

40:04.026 --> 40:05.277
Did I bring you here?

40:07.071 --> 40:07.988
I feel like I--

40:08.697 --> 40:10.157
Oh, I'm freezing.

40:10.866 --> 40:13.786
Hey, get your jacket.
Come on, put your jacket on.

40:22.420 --> 40:23.337
Oh my God.

40:24.088 --> 40:25.047
The cave.

40:27.425 --> 40:28.592
Zeke, you were right.

40:29.093 --> 40:31.887
You're coming out of the glow,
and you're going into the cave.

40:32.388 --> 40:36.267
That's why you can't remember anything
because you're going back into real life.

40:36.267 --> 40:38.144
Back to 2018.

40:39.770 --> 40:40.896
Before we ever met.

40:43.399 --> 40:44.525
So we haven't met.

40:46.944 --> 40:48.487
You just look so familiar.

40:50.114 --> 40:52.366
But we will. We will meet.

40:53.242 --> 40:55.453
And we're gonna fall hopelessly in love,

40:55.453 --> 40:59.123
and you're gonna cook me fancy dinners,
and you're gonna make me laugh.

40:59.623 --> 41:01.625
You're gonna leave your wet towels
on the floor

41:02.168 --> 41:03.669
and you're gonna make love to me.

41:07.256 --> 41:08.799
This doesn't make any sense.

41:10.384 --> 41:11.635
[rumbling]

41:19.935 --> 41:22.813
I want more time. I don't want you to go.

41:23.856 --> 41:26.358
Let's go together.
You can show me the way.

41:27.401 --> 41:28.319
I can't.

41:28.861 --> 41:31.280
It has to be like this
for us to have what we had, Zeke.

41:32.239 --> 41:35.201
Our story is ending,
but you're going back to the beginning.

41:37.203 --> 41:38.162
I'm sorry.

41:40.080 --> 41:42.875
Zeke, okay, listen.
You have to find the cabin.

41:42.875 --> 41:46.045
It's down the mountain. I will be there.
I will be waiting for you.

41:46.045 --> 41:49.298
I won't know who you are,
but you have to do this for our story.

41:49.298 --> 41:51.217
Please go... go find the cabin.

41:51.217 --> 41:52.885
I don't understand.

[sighs]

41:54.762 --> 41:56.138
Look in your pocket.

42:04.396 --> 42:06.607
Repeat after me, all right? Find her.

42:07.399 --> 42:09.235
Find her. Say it.

42:09.235 --> 42:10.819
Find her.

Find her.
