00:26.660 --> 00:28.030
Yes!
Hello, Sam.

00:28.230 --> 00:29.510
You seem agitated.

00:29.710 --> 00:32.080
I just got accepted
into my summer program.

00:32.280 --> 00:34.300
Oh, summer school. I didn't
realize you were struggling.

00:34.500 --> 00:35.690
But way to not give up.

00:35.890 --> 00:36.740
No.

00:36.940 --> 00:38.260
It's at Columbia.

00:38.460 --> 00:39.480
This is gonna
look really good

00:39.680 --> 00:40.570
on my grad school
application.

00:40.770 --> 00:41.920
Grad school?

00:42.110 --> 00:42.790
Those applications are
a year away.

00:42.990 --> 00:44.140
You have to start early.

00:44.330 --> 00:45.920
It's so competitive
these days.

00:46.120 --> 00:47.310
I think I'll be fine.

00:47.510 --> 00:48.750
Where are you hoping to go?

00:48.950 --> 00:50.270
Caltech.Sheldon,

00:50.470 --> 00:51.750
that's one of the
toughest programs

00:51.950 --> 00:52.970
to get into in the world.

00:53.170 --> 00:54.750
I know, they deserve the best.

00:54.950 --> 00:55.800
Well, if I were you,
I would start

00:56.000 --> 00:57.020
building up my résumé now.

00:57.220 --> 00:58.580
Uh, my résumé's pretty good.

00:58.780 --> 01:00.410
4.0, child prodigy.

01:00.610 --> 01:01.850
Beloved wherever I go.

01:02.050 --> 01:03.890
Are you on any published papers?

01:04.090 --> 01:05.550
No.

01:05.750 --> 01:06.590
Have you presented
at any conferences?

01:06.790 --> 01:08.120
No.

01:08.320 --> 01:10.160
Have you been involved
in any outside projects?

01:10.360 --> 01:12.470
I did develop
a grant research database.

01:12.670 --> 01:13.690
Oh, well that's something.

01:13.890 --> 01:15.590
It failed spectacularly.

Well, hey...

02:24.040 --> 02:25.320

you know.

02:25.520 --> 02:27.110
It's not as easy
as you'd think.

02:27.310 --> 02:29.500
You got to look forward,

department at Columbia.

Oh, she got in, fantastic.Mm-hmm.

02:54.900 --> 02:56.530
I know she was hoping
to spice up

02:56.730 --> 02:57.920
her applications.

02:58.120 --> 02:59.660
Well, I like to think
that I'm all the spice

02:59.860 --> 03:01.190
my applications will need.

03:01.380 --> 03:02.230
You're not.

03:02.430 --> 03:03.750
What are you saying?

03:03.950 --> 03:05.580
Actually, uh...

03:05.780 --> 03:07.150
Hold on,
should I be trying to beef up

03:07.350 --> 03:08.370
my grad school applications?

03:08.570 --> 03:10.410
The competition is fierce.

03:10.610 --> 03:12.070
It takes a lot to stand out.

03:12.260 --> 03:13.940
You're my advisors,
why didn't you

03:14.140 --> 03:15.330
advise me of this?

03:15.530 --> 03:18.160
Sheldon, if I could
offer you some advice...

03:18.360 --> 03:20.250
No thank you.

03:20.450 --> 03:22.120
Sheldon, I have
a recommendation for you.

03:22.320 --> 03:23.120
I have one for you.

03:23.320 --> 03:24.370
Trim your nose hair.

03:25.240 --> 03:26.600
Do you remember that?

03:26.800 --> 03:29.030
I do. It looked like a spider
was living up there.

03:32.860 --> 03:33.910
Hey.

03:34.110 --> 03:35.610
Hey. What are you doing here?

03:35.810 --> 03:37.960
Oh, just looking through
some of my old videotapes.

03:38.160 --> 03:39.750
Oh, cool.

03:39.940 --> 03:41.570
Wait, you didn't find
any of my tapes, did you?

03:41.770 --> 03:43.660
What are your tapes?

03:43.860 --> 03:45.710
Nothing.

03:45.910 --> 03:47.880
Well, mine are from
when I was a weather girl.

03:48.080 --> 03:50.190
Whatcha need 'em for?

03:50.390 --> 03:51.320
Well, the local station's
looking.

03:51.520 --> 03:52.580
I'm gonna apply.

03:53.710 --> 03:55.100
But you're a mom now.

03:56.190 --> 03:57.680
Yeah, so?

03:57.880 --> 03:59.200
Well, I'm just sayin'
don't you kind of have

03:59.400 --> 04:00.800
your hands full with CeeCee?

04:01.980 --> 04:03.600
Well, there's a lot of
family around to help.

04:03.790 --> 04:04.940
Well, I know, but...

04:05.140 --> 04:06.420
And I was always gonna
go back to work.

04:06.620 --> 04:07.690
If it's about money,

04:07.890 --> 04:08.990
we're good.

04:09.190 --> 04:10.730
You live in a garage.

04:10.930 --> 04:12.170
It ain't a garage
if there ain't a car in it.

04:12.370 --> 04:13.690
Yeah, it is.

04:13.890 --> 04:15.430
And it's not about money,
it's about my life.

04:15.630 --> 04:16.960
I want a career.

04:17.160 --> 04:19.440
Well, I-I happen to think
motherhood is a career.

04:19.640 --> 04:21.740
Hmm. What about fatherhood?

04:21.940 --> 04:23.480
You have a job.

04:23.680 --> 04:25.440
That's different.Why?

04:25.640 --> 04:27.050
Because.

04:27.250 --> 04:29.060
There's lots of reasons.

04:29.250 --> 04:31.190
Oh, okay, so you just get
to have a job and a life,

04:31.390 --> 04:32.840
and I have to stay
home with the baby?

04:33.040 --> 04:35.500
Or I have to have a job

04:35.700 --> 04:37.460
and you <i>get</i>to stay home
with the baby.

04:37.650 --> 04:39.800
It's all
about perspective.

04:41.280 --> 04:42.630
SHELDON:
<i>Yes, is this</i>

04:42.830 --> 04:44.770
the Columbia
summer science honors program?

04:44.970 --> 04:46.550
Excellent.

04:46.750 --> 04:49.160
My name is Sheldon Cooper,
perhaps you've heard of me.

04:49.360 --> 04:50.990
Well, now you have.

04:51.190 --> 04:52.990
Anyways, it's recently
come to my attention

04:53.190 --> 04:55.340
that you could be an important
step in my career advancement.

04:55.540 --> 04:58.000
So, good news, I'm available.

04:58.200 --> 05:00.260
Yes, I understand
I've missed the deadline,

05:00.460 --> 05:02.430
but I'm sure
you can make an exception.

05:04.080 --> 05:05.470
But I'm Sheldon Cooper.

05:11.220 --> 05:12.530
And apparently Doctors
Linkletter and Sturgis were

05:12.730 --> 05:13.970
aware that I already
should have been focusing

05:14.170 --> 05:15.580
on my applications.

05:15.780 --> 05:17.230
And they didn't say anything
to you?

05:17.430 --> 05:19.850
Well, they did, but I don't
come off well in that story.

05:20.040 --> 05:22.500
Shelly, how bad could it be?

05:22.700 --> 05:24.940
You started college
when you were 11.

05:25.140 --> 05:26.630
Well, it was impressive
when I was little and cute.

05:26.830 --> 05:29.320
But now that I'm old and cute,
it's just not the same thing.

05:30.370 --> 05:31.990
Well, just 'cause
you look older,

05:32.190 --> 05:33.950
doesn't mean
you're any less special.

05:34.150 --> 05:35.820
Of course.

05:36.020 --> 05:38.430
It's your fault.What?

05:38.630 --> 05:40.000
Well, you've been saying
I'm special my whole life,

05:40.200 --> 05:41.560
so now I'm conditioned
to expect the world

05:41.760 --> 05:43.650
to cater to me
instead of taking initiative.

05:43.850 --> 05:46.430
But you are special, sweetie.

05:47.520 --> 05:49.300
You just can't turn it off,
can you?

05:50.690 --> 05:53.170

05:56.820 --> 05:58.610

right?

06:00.360 --> 06:02.580
Shelly, you want
some mashed potatoes?

06:02.780 --> 06:03.850
See, there you go again,

06:04.050 --> 06:05.280
bringing the mashed potatoes
to me

06:05.480 --> 06:06.670
when I should be going
to the mashed potatoes.

06:06.870 --> 06:08.370
Fine.

06:08.570 --> 06:10.460
What's goin' on?

06:10.660 --> 06:12.070
Years of coddling
have made me complacent,

06:12.270 --> 06:13.810
and now it may cost me my chance

06:14.010 --> 06:15.210
to get into grad school
at Caltech.

06:15.400 --> 06:16.980
I've been sayin' that
since you were born.

06:17.850 --> 06:19.430
And yet you did
nothing to stop her?

06:19.630 --> 06:21.080
If it helps,
I always thought you sucked.

06:21.280 --> 06:22.690
MARY:
Missy.

06:22.890 --> 06:24.390
I talked to Meemaw.
She said if you

06:24.590 --> 06:27.130
come back to work at the video
store, you can bring the baby.

06:27.330 --> 06:29.130
What? I thought
you wanted a job.

06:29.330 --> 06:30.740
No, I said
I wanted a career.

06:30.940 --> 06:32.870
Oh, are you thinkin'

06:33.070 --> 06:34.350
about going back
to work already?

06:34.550 --> 06:35.920
Yeah.

06:36.120 --> 06:37.620
I mean, it's a little earlier

06:37.820 --> 06:39.490
than I thought,
but an opportunity

06:39.690 --> 06:41.060
came up and I'm going for it.

06:41.260 --> 06:43.150
See? Initiative.
Her parents kicked her out,

06:43.350 --> 06:44.540
and look at that gumption.

06:44.740 --> 06:46.450
So what job you goin' for?

06:46.650 --> 06:48.370
Channel 7's looking
for a new weather girl.

06:48.570 --> 06:50.330
Oh, yeah,
she said she quit

06:50.530 --> 06:51.980
because she was
getting married.

06:52.180 --> 06:54.540
Rumor is she got knocked up.
[chuckles]

06:56.890 --> 06:58.380
Which is exciting.

06:58.580 --> 07:00.250
The interview's on Thursday.

07:00.450 --> 07:01.900
What?

07:02.100 --> 07:03.380
You already applied?

07:03.580 --> 07:04.910
I thought we were
gonna talk about it.

07:05.110 --> 07:06.560
We did talk about it.
I said I was gonna

07:06.760 --> 07:08.430
send in a tape
and then I sent it in.

07:08.630 --> 07:10.040
Who's gonna watch CeeCee?

07:10.240 --> 07:11.830
Well, I was hoping

07:12.030 --> 07:13.390
her family would help out.

07:13.590 --> 07:15.220
Of course.

07:15.420 --> 07:16.400
I mean, I do work.

07:16.600 --> 07:17.700
I work, too, George.

07:17.900 --> 07:19.050
<i>We</i>work.

07:19.250 --> 07:20.440
They got a point.

07:20.640 --> 07:21.840
Uh, is the point

07:22.040 --> 07:23.620
that your mom is
a working mother?

07:23.820 --> 07:26.320
Well, I didn't work
when my kids were babies.

07:26.520 --> 07:28.190
That's true, she was
a stay-at-home coddler.

07:28.390 --> 07:30.110
Okay, now you're
being obnoxious.

07:30.310 --> 07:32.110
No one wants to hear
you talk, ass face.

07:32.310 --> 07:34.590
Thanks, I appreciate the help,
but let's keep it clean.

07:34.790 --> 07:35.760
Butt wad?

07:35.960 --> 07:37.890
Better.

07:43.590 --> 07:45.590
Well, that's a look.

07:47.590 --> 07:49.300
That's also a look.

07:49.500 --> 07:51.080
I can't find anything
to wear for my interview.

07:51.280 --> 07:52.950
Well, let's see.

07:53.150 --> 07:54.610
Hmm.

07:54.810 --> 07:56.310
That's pretty cute.

07:56.510 --> 07:57.960
"Can't find" was code

07:58.160 --> 07:59.350
for "can't fit into."

07:59.550 --> 08:00.830
Don't be so hard on yourself,
honey.

08:01.030 --> 08:02.530
You just had a baby.

08:02.730 --> 08:03.920
I'll make sure
to tell them that.

08:04.120 --> 08:05.620
Apparently everyone loves
a working mother.

08:05.820 --> 08:07.620
Is that code for something?

08:07.820 --> 08:09.540
Yeah, your family sucks.

08:09.740 --> 08:11.540
Ooh, sounds like
I missed a good dinner.

08:11.740 --> 08:14.500
Am I a bad mom
because I want a career?Hell no!

08:14.700 --> 08:16.410
And you're teachin' your
daughter that she can grow up

08:16.610 --> 08:18.630
to do something
more than raise kids.

08:18.830 --> 08:19.680
Yeah!

08:19.880 --> 08:20.770
And you're gonna go in there

08:20.960 --> 08:22.110
and you're gonna get this job.

08:22.310 --> 08:22.810
Yeah!

08:23.010 --> 08:24.330
But not in that.

08:24.530 --> 08:26.150
Yeah.

08:27.280 --> 08:28.690
I'm waitin'.
For what?

08:28.890 --> 08:30.730
The "I told you so."

08:30.930 --> 08:32.430
'Cause I coddled

08:32.630 --> 08:35.000
Sheldon and apparently
ruined his life.

08:35.200 --> 08:36.170
Oh.

08:36.370 --> 08:38.220
I'm not gonna say that.

08:38.420 --> 08:41.130
I mean, you did coddle him
and I did tell ya--

08:41.330 --> 08:42.530
All right,
I told you so.

08:42.730 --> 08:44.220
Thanks for not sayin' it.

08:44.420 --> 08:46.310
Well, what does he know?

08:46.510 --> 08:48.010
He's just a dumb teenager.

08:48.210 --> 08:50.360
I guess it is normal
for teenagers

08:50.560 --> 08:52.410
to blame their parents
for stuff.

08:52.600 --> 08:53.750
Sheldon's normal.

08:53.950 --> 08:55.020
That's a shocker.

08:55.220 --> 08:57.190
Great, the one
normal thing he does

08:57.390 --> 08:59.020
is blame me.
[chuckles]
Someday

08:59.220 --> 09:01.680
his kids are gonna tell him
he's ruinin' their lives.

09:01.880 --> 09:02.890
You think?

09:03.090 --> 09:05.060
If he has 'em,
they're gonna say it.

09:06.060 --> 09:08.120
So probably not.

09:08.320 --> 09:10.030
ADULT SHELDON:
<i>Joke's on him.</i>

09:10.230 --> 09:11.640
<i>I did have kids.</i>

09:11.840 --> 09:13.120
<i>And joke's on me.</i>

09:13.320 --> 09:16.030
<i>They say it all the time.</i>

09:18.810 --> 09:20.040
[door opens]

09:20.240 --> 09:22.260
Good morning.

09:22.460 --> 09:24.130
Oh, you're out and about early.

09:24.330 --> 09:25.920
Yeah, got a lot going on today.

09:26.120 --> 09:28.010
Connie's taking me out shopping
and then to the salon

09:28.210 --> 09:29.750
to get ready for my interview.Nice.

09:29.950 --> 09:31.400
A little mommy-daughter day?

09:31.600 --> 09:33.400
Daddy-daughter day.
Here ya go.

09:33.600 --> 09:35.140
I have work.

09:35.340 --> 09:37.710
Well, I like to think
fatherhood is a full-time job.

09:37.910 --> 09:39.150
How am I gonna feed her?

09:39.350 --> 09:41.410
I don't have the...
you know.

09:41.610 --> 09:42.980
Formula's in the bag.

09:43.180 --> 09:44.200
Tag, you're it.

09:44.400 --> 09:45.890
Bye, CeeCee.

09:46.090 --> 09:47.720
[door closes]

09:47.920 --> 09:50.420
Well, looks like
it's just me and you.

09:50.620 --> 09:52.550
Let me give you the tour.

09:52.750 --> 09:54.900
That's Axl Rose.

09:55.100 --> 09:56.730
He's awesome.

09:56.930 --> 09:58.040
That's the weight bench.

09:58.240 --> 09:59.990
That's where Daddy
gets ripped.

10:00.190 --> 10:02.080
Yeah.
And that's the sink

10:02.280 --> 10:03.910
your mom totally peed in once.

10:04.110 --> 10:05.830
It's true.

10:06.030 --> 10:07.180
I know, it's true.

10:07.380 --> 10:09.740
Ooh, Volvo-- safe and flashy.

10:09.940 --> 10:11.700
Like me.
Sheldon...

10:11.900 --> 10:12.830
I haven't had my coffee yet.

10:13.030 --> 10:14.970
I thought you
might say that.

10:15.170 --> 10:17.270
Thank you.I'm not a coffee drinker.

10:17.470 --> 10:18.800
I hope you like seven sugars.

10:19.000 --> 10:20.150
[coughs]

10:20.340 --> 10:22.410
So what's so important
it got you outside?

10:22.610 --> 10:24.500
I had an idea that I think
might be beneficial

10:24.700 --> 10:26.330
to both the university and me.

10:26.520 --> 10:28.240
An exclusive summer program led

10:28.440 --> 10:30.160
by a prestigious scientist
of my choosing.

10:30.350 --> 10:31.940
I've got an idea.

10:32.140 --> 10:34.030
Apply to a school
that already has it,

10:34.230 --> 10:35.550
get in, and go there.

10:35.750 --> 10:37.160
Well, to be honest,

10:37.360 --> 10:39.160
with my current résumé,
I may not get in anywhere,

10:39.360 --> 10:41.250
which is why we need
a program like this.

10:41.450 --> 10:43.730
Sheldon, we don't have the time
or the resources

10:43.930 --> 10:46.300
to create
a brand-new summer program.

10:46.500 --> 10:48.260
Oh, that's just sleepy talk.
Take a few more sips,

10:48.460 --> 10:49.700
let that sugar kick in.

10:49.900 --> 10:52.080
The answer is no.

10:53.520 --> 10:55.950
I knew I should have put
whiskey in that coffee.

10:57.480 --> 11:00.190
[games dinging]

11:00.380 --> 11:01.530
Whose baby?

11:01.730 --> 11:03.010
Mine.

11:03.210 --> 11:05.710
And you brought her
to a gambling room?

11:05.910 --> 11:07.980
Why not? There's flashin'
lights and fun noises.

11:08.180 --> 11:09.630
It's basically Chuck E. Cheese.

11:09.830 --> 11:11.630
Can I touch her head for luck?

11:11.830 --> 11:12.680
No.

11:12.880 --> 11:15.190
Come on, I just washed my hands.

11:16.240 --> 11:17.760
Make it quick.

11:18.980 --> 11:20.290
Come on, baby.

11:20.490 --> 11:22.560
Uncle Wade needs a win.

11:22.750 --> 11:24.770
All right, that's enough.

11:25.810 --> 11:28.200
[beeping, dinging]

11:29.600 --> 11:31.390
That's what I'm talkin' about!

11:31.590 --> 11:34.260
I told you babies is good luck.

11:34.460 --> 11:36.570
Can I touch her head, too?

11:36.770 --> 11:40.010
All right, no one else is
touchin' my baby's head...

11:40.210 --> 11:42.010
for free.

11:42.210 --> 11:43.660
How much?

11:43.860 --> 11:45.190
Five bucks.

11:45.390 --> 11:46.830
Worth it.Sold.

11:56.410 --> 11:57.850
[door slams]
MEEMAW:
Hey, dummy.

11:58.050 --> 11:59.460
We need to talk.

11:59.660 --> 12:02.460
If it's about CeeCee
being here, I can explain.

12:02.660 --> 12:03.730
Where is she?

12:03.930 --> 12:05.370
WADE:
Right here.

12:07.900 --> 12:09.380
[whispers]:
Really?

12:09.580 --> 12:10.560
It's fine.

12:10.760 --> 12:11.600
He's got, like, 15 grandkids.

12:11.800 --> 12:14.220
We'll get back to that.

12:14.420 --> 12:16.090
I have spent my day

12:16.290 --> 12:19.130
listening to Mandy
bitch about you.

12:19.330 --> 12:20.700
Well, I don't suppose
you stuck up for me?

12:20.900 --> 12:22.090
No.

12:22.290 --> 12:23.960
If you really want
to be with that girl,

12:24.160 --> 12:26.140
you will not be the one
to stand in her way.

12:26.340 --> 12:28.230
I'm not trying to.

12:28.430 --> 12:30.750
I just want to do
what's best for CeeCee.

12:32.050 --> 12:32.890
Obviously.

12:33.090 --> 12:34.540
Don't you think she deserves

12:34.740 --> 12:35.890
a mom who's home with her?

12:36.090 --> 12:38.110
I think she deserves
a mom who's happy

12:38.310 --> 12:39.840
and supported by her dad.

12:41.150 --> 12:42.290
Huh.

12:42.490 --> 12:44.590
Why is that woman
touchin' her head?

12:44.790 --> 12:45.640
I'll handle it. Hey!

12:45.840 --> 12:48.020
You got to pay for that.

12:51.770 --> 12:53.420
[sighs]
Come on, Cooper.

12:55.120 --> 12:56.560
See? He's been here
since this morning.

12:56.760 --> 12:58.350
He won't leave.

12:58.550 --> 13:00.780
What do you want me to do?Get him to leave.

13:00.980 --> 13:02.960
Oh, good, you're both here.

13:03.160 --> 13:04.610
This will go faster
with three of us.

13:04.810 --> 13:06.830
Now, do it!
Give him the boot.

13:07.030 --> 13:08.010
[laughs]

13:08.210 --> 13:10.450
Trying to solve
unified field theory?

13:10.650 --> 13:12.190
Yes. Who needs
a summer program

13:12.390 --> 13:14.190
if you can solve what
Albert Einstein couldn't.

13:14.390 --> 13:15.840
Let's see Caltech
say no to this.

13:16.040 --> 13:17.800
Sheldon, you're not
gonna solve this

13:18.000 --> 13:20.190
in an afternoon.Or ever.

13:20.390 --> 13:21.980
Well, I need to do something
to stand out.

13:22.180 --> 13:23.760
I think you're putting
too much pressure

13:23.960 --> 13:25.720
on this summer program.

13:25.920 --> 13:27.810
You can apply next year.

13:28.010 --> 13:28.900
I can't wait a whole
nother year.

13:29.100 --> 13:30.420
I'll fall even further behind.

13:30.620 --> 13:32.380
And then when I'm
applying to Columbia,

13:32.580 --> 13:34.300
Sam will be using
her letter of recommendation

13:34.500 --> 13:36.210
to get into Caltech, and then
when I apply to Caltech,

13:36.410 --> 13:38.560
they'll say, "Oh, you're
from East Texas Tech, too.

13:38.760 --> 13:40.650
"Well, you must know Sam, she's
been here a year longer than you

13:40.850 --> 13:42.160
and you'll never catch up."

13:43.210 --> 13:44.960
I think you need to calm down.

13:45.160 --> 13:46.660
I can't calm down.
I have to keep pushing myself

13:46.860 --> 13:48.220
or I'll fall farther and
farther behind until I'm a...

13:48.420 --> 13:49.960
aging professor
in a small university

13:50.160 --> 13:51.840
with nothing to show
for my work.

13:52.030 --> 13:53.750
Ouch, I think
he's talking about you.

13:53.950 --> 13:55.840
I think he's talking about us.

13:56.040 --> 13:57.540
No.I'm wasting

13:57.740 --> 13:58.840
too much time sleeping at night.

13:59.040 --> 14:00.630
In fact,
where's the coffee machine?

14:00.830 --> 14:02.850
Perhaps it is time I start
chasing the caffeine dragon.

14:03.050 --> 14:04.850
Sheldon, listen to us.Why should I?

14:05.050 --> 14:06.240
You let this happen to me.

14:06.440 --> 14:07.840
You failed as my mentors.

14:10.760 --> 14:12.420
What are you doing?!

14:12.620 --> 14:14.070
You're still the student,
this is still my office,

14:14.270 --> 14:16.070
and it's time for you to leave.

14:17.900 --> 14:19.850
I'm afraid he's right.

14:25.560 --> 14:26.570
[Mandy gasps]

14:26.760 --> 14:29.040
There she is.

14:30.170 --> 14:31.880
Hi!

14:32.070 --> 14:34.270
Um, why does she
smell like smoke?

14:34.470 --> 14:36.400
Oh, she hung out with me
in the gambling room.

14:36.600 --> 14:37.970
What?

14:38.170 --> 14:39.870
She was a hit. Everybody
said she was good luck.

14:40.920 --> 14:42.450
Okay, so I-I guess it went well?

14:42.650 --> 14:44.280
It did.

14:44.480 --> 14:45.760
So, if you get that job,

14:45.960 --> 14:48.100
I'm all for it.

[CeeCee fussing]

14:50.660 --> 14:52.020
Okay, good.

14:52.760 --> 14:54.240
What's wrong?

14:56.630 --> 14:58.510
Today was the longest
I've been away from her,

14:58.710 --> 15:00.600
and it was awful.

15:00.800 --> 15:03.070
So you don't want the job?

15:04.720 --> 15:06.130
I-I don't know.

15:06.330 --> 15:08.770
I think you should
give it a shot.

15:09.820 --> 15:12.390
Really?Well, you were
all excited about it.

15:12.590 --> 15:14.130
And if you get the job,
you can still say no.

15:15.740 --> 15:16.960
Yeah, that's a good point.

I'd love to see you on TV.

I slept with that girl on TV.

the most angst-filled song

15:45.410 --> 15:47.250
I could find
in Mom's record collection.

You wouldn't understand.

Okay, bye.

understand your problems.

Well, you're all I've got.

15:59.680 --> 16:01.360
I always assumed

student in grad school,

to win the Nobel Prize,

I get treated special

16:11.260 --> 16:12.500
because of my age and intellect?

16:12.700 --> 16:16.110
I guess you do get everything
you want all the time.

16:16.310 --> 16:17.110
See?

16:17.310 --> 16:18.850
And whenever you're obnoxious

16:19.050 --> 16:20.640
it's always, "Poor Sheldon,
he doesn't know any better."

16:20.840 --> 16:22.550
Exactly. "Poor Sheldon."

16:22.750 --> 16:25.030
At grad school, everybody's
going to be smart.

16:25.230 --> 16:26.730

how am I gonna stand out?

16:26.930 --> 16:29.820
Sheldon, you're a kid talking
about going to grad school.

16:30.020 --> 16:31.650
You have no problems.

16:31.850 --> 16:33.390
I knew you wouldn't understand.

16:33.590 --> 16:35.520
I do-- instead of
being a kid genius,

16:35.720 --> 16:37.570
you're worried you're just
gonna be a regular genius,

16:37.770 --> 16:40.480
which is a stupid thing for
a genius to worry about.

16:40.680 --> 16:42.270
Well, stupid or not,

16:42.470 --> 16:44.390
I may not get to go
to Caltech until I'm 15.

16:45.430 --> 16:46.970
Wait, this is about
when you move out?

16:47.170 --> 16:48.270
Yes.

16:48.470 --> 16:50.880
I take it back,
this is a big deal.

16:51.080 --> 16:53.970
♪ Because I'm free ♪

16:54.170 --> 16:57.150
♪ Nothing's worrying me. ♪

16:57.350 --> 16:58.280
All right.

16:58.480 --> 16:59.540
So, we're just gonna
put you on tape

16:59.740 --> 17:00.720
and see how it goes.

17:00.920 --> 17:03.420
Okay. Uh, I'm ready.

17:03.620 --> 17:05.160
Okay.

17:05.360 --> 17:06.200
In three...

17:06.400 --> 17:08.500
[mouthing]

17:09.590 --> 17:12.300
All right, let's take a look
at our forecast for tonight.

17:12.500 --> 17:14.520
Winds from the west
are headed our way,

17:14.720 --> 17:18.170
taking temperatures
down to a cool 43 degrees.

17:18.370 --> 17:19.610
But you know what
they say in Texas--

17:19.810 --> 17:22.090
if you don't like the weather,
wait five minutes.

17:22.290 --> 17:23.790
Actually, I've never said that,

17:23.990 --> 17:25.090
but my Aunt Bonnie does.

17:25.290 --> 17:27.220
She's not
wrong though,

17:27.420 --> 17:29.970
because those chilly days
are gonna pass us by,

17:30.170 --> 17:33.490
and by the weekend we're
looking at sunny and 72.

17:33.690 --> 17:35.410
ADULT SHELDON: <i>Mandy was</i>
<i>proving that new mothers</i>

17:35.610 --> 17:37.150
<i>could do anything</i>
<i>anyone else could do.</i>

17:37.350 --> 17:39.710
<i>In fact, they could do more,</i>

17:39.910 --> 17:42.150
<i>like make their own milk,</i>

17:42.350 --> 17:43.760
<i>right there, on camera.</i>

17:43.960 --> 17:46.020
Everything okay?

17:47.320 --> 17:48.900
Not if you live on the coast,

17:49.100 --> 17:51.160
because there is
a storm front building,

17:51.360 --> 17:53.600
so we need to keep
an eye on, uh,

17:53.800 --> 17:54.690
these clouds

17:54.890 --> 17:56.600
right here.

17:56.800 --> 17:58.820
Uh, but there's a low-pressure
system building,

17:59.020 --> 18:00.430
um, over here,

18:00.630 --> 18:02.220
and, uh,

18:02.420 --> 18:03.960
well, then, that could
bring rain to, uh,

18:04.160 --> 18:05.910
to this whole area here.

18:07.170 --> 18:08.350
So, for Channel 7 weather,

18:08.550 --> 18:11.910
I'm Mandy McAllister.
Good night.

18:20.620 --> 18:22.060
And I just wanted to say
I'm sorry for my behavior.

18:22.260 --> 18:24.060
I realized that
I'm going to age out

18:24.260 --> 18:25.940
of being a child prodigy
regardless of your help.

18:26.130 --> 18:27.680
I appreciate that.

18:27.880 --> 18:30.900
It takes maturity to
admit when you're wrong.

18:31.100 --> 18:33.070
I know, even this apology
is grown-up.

18:33.270 --> 18:34.640
Well, this is all a disaster.

18:34.840 --> 18:37.420
Son, it's not. Believe me,
no one is more excited

18:37.620 --> 18:39.340
for you to go to grad school
than I am.

18:39.540 --> 18:41.340
I don't know, you should
talk to my sister.

18:41.540 --> 18:43.260
Anyway, thank you
for hearing me out.

18:43.460 --> 18:46.090
Actually, Sheldon,
I do have some news.

18:46.290 --> 18:47.390
I reached out
to a colleague

18:47.590 --> 18:50.050
who's doing a summer
research program

18:50.250 --> 18:52.270
at the University of Heidelberg,

18:52.470 --> 18:54.400
and I think I can get you in.

18:54.600 --> 18:56.310
Heidelberg, Germany?

18:56.510 --> 18:58.180
A summer program
5,000 miles away.

18:58.380 --> 19:00.100
Only a fool would
say no to that.

19:00.300 --> 19:02.840
Well, that would certainly help
my grad school applications.

19:03.040 --> 19:03.970
STURGIS:
Yes, and they're doing

19:04.170 --> 19:06.630
exciting work on superstrings.

19:06.830 --> 19:09.200
<i>Fantastisch.</i>
That's German for "fantastic."

19:09.400 --> 19:11.280
<i>Ich helfe dir beim packen.</i>

19:11.480 --> 19:13.150
That's German for
"I'll help you pack."
