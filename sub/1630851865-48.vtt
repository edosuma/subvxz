Bleugh! Rain!

00:37.360 --> 00:39.160
Rain again.

00:39.320 --> 00:41.720
Still raining! I wish it would stop,

00:41.879 --> 00:43.839
so we could do something fun today!

00:43.960 --> 00:45.440
I don't know. I like rain.

00:45.559 --> 00:47.599
It gives me the chance
to read a good book.

00:47.720 --> 00:52.280
<i>1001 Expert Tips to Avoid Disaster?</i>

00:52.400 --> 00:55.440
It's the latest book
in the Worried-Cat series! Hmm?

00:56.320 --> 01:00.000
Look, Ollie! It's Dolly and Zoom
calling from New Zealand!

01:00.120 --> 01:01.320
Hey, Dolly! Hey, Zoom!

01:01.440 --> 01:03.000
[broken speech]

01:03.160 --> 01:04.800
Wow. Bad connection.

01:04.959 --> 01:06.800
I can't understand a word they're saying!

01:06.920 --> 01:10.200
-Did you catch anything?
-[copying them perfectly]

01:10.360 --> 01:13.000
That must mean, "Hello, Ollie and Moon".

01:13.160 --> 01:14.360
-Really?
-Uh-huh.

01:14.479 --> 01:17.679
OK. How are you two?

01:17.800 --> 01:21.679
[broken speech]

01:21.800 --> 01:26.759
Wait! "Eee nee elp"
must mean "We need help".

01:26.920 --> 01:30.080
OK. But what about "woo ree atch?"

01:30.240 --> 01:32.759
-Hmm.
-We should call them back.

01:32.880 --> 01:34.720
No need! Let's see...

01:35.280 --> 01:38.520
They're sort of waving
at their sports trophies.

01:38.679 --> 01:40.119
And they live in New Zealand.

01:40.240 --> 01:43.000
And the most popular sport there is rugby!

01:43.160 --> 01:46.839
So "woo ree atch" must mean rugby match!

01:46.960 --> 01:49.080
They need help winning their rugby match!

01:49.240 --> 01:51.720
Brainstorm! Let's go to New Zealand!

01:51.839 --> 01:55.240
Or we could call them back
to make sure that's what they mean.

01:55.360 --> 01:57.119
Our friends need our help, Ollie!

01:57.280 --> 01:58.640
There's no time to waste!

01:58.759 --> 02:01.320
No problem, gals! We're on our way!

02:02.320 --> 02:03.280
-Ollie?
-Yup!

02:03.399 --> 02:06.600
Just looking up how to avoid
brainstorm disasters.

02:12.799 --> 02:14.040
Whoo!

02:15.120 --> 02:16.440
Whee!

02:23.280 --> 02:27.840
<i>Now arriving in New Zealand! Yay!</i>

02:34.920 --> 02:37.560
Oh! Look! Rugby players!

02:37.680 --> 02:40.519
Oh, I'm so excited to show off
my rugby skills.

02:42.640 --> 02:45.000
-You, Ollie?
-[grunting]

02:45.160 --> 02:47.000
-Here we go!
-Just as long as my book

02:47.160 --> 02:49.840
has a chapter on avoiding
rugby disasters...

02:50.519 --> 02:53.239
-Woop! Too late!
-Oh! Uh... hi!

02:53.359 --> 02:55.040
We're looking for Dolly and Zoom.

02:55.200 --> 02:58.760
Sure! This is their big day.

02:58.920 --> 03:02.239
We're on our way to see them
break a world record!

03:02.359 --> 03:04.440
-[groans]
-Uh-oh, Ollie.

03:04.600 --> 03:08.079
I guess "woo ree" wasn't "rugby"
after all.

03:08.239 --> 03:09.920
It must have been "world record".

03:10.079 --> 03:12.120
That's what they wanted us
to help them with.

03:12.239 --> 03:13.560
Ooh, my mistake.

03:13.679 --> 03:16.640
A mistake we could've avoided
by calling them back.

03:17.040 --> 03:19.480
Mistakes can lead to disasters, Moon.

03:19.640 --> 03:23.280
Oh, please!
Mistakes lead to new adventures, Ollie!

03:23.399 --> 03:26.280
I just hope the world record
is for something we're good at!

03:29.959 --> 03:31.480
-Ah!
-Whoa!

03:32.000 --> 03:34.480
-Woo-hoo! Yeah!
-Here we are!

03:34.600 --> 03:38.399
At Dolly and Zoom's world-record
attempt... for knitting!

03:39.799 --> 03:41.119
-Oh, no!
-Knitting?

03:41.239 --> 03:44.399
Dolly and Zoom are so inspiring!

03:46.560 --> 03:51.040
Ollie! Moon! Hooray!
The rest of our team is here!

03:51.160 --> 03:53.600
We have a lot more to knit,
and time is running out!

03:56.480 --> 03:58.280
About that, actually...

03:58.399 --> 04:00.920
Remember that bad connection we had?

04:01.079 --> 04:04.079
We thought you wanted help with rugby.

04:04.239 --> 04:06.920
And... I don't know how to say this...

04:07.079 --> 04:09.600
I do! We have no idea how to knit.

04:09.720 --> 04:12.239
Oh! This is bad!

04:12.399 --> 04:15.079
But we'll be happy to try!
Let's watch and learn, Ollie!

04:15.239 --> 04:17.279
But, Moon, knitting takes practice.

04:17.399 --> 04:19.200
It's really complicated.

04:19.320 --> 04:21.360
A disaster waiting to happen!

04:21.479 --> 04:22.560
[screams]

04:23.760 --> 04:26.080
See? We can help in some other way.

04:26.440 --> 04:30.479
Well, we are down
to our last big ball of yarn.

04:30.640 --> 04:33.360
You could really help us
by going for more supplies.

04:33.560 --> 04:35.440
Here's the kind of yarn we need
and where to get it.

04:35.760 --> 04:39.360
-Big ball of yarn coming up!
-We won't let you down!

04:39.919 --> 04:41.039
[panting]

04:41.159 --> 04:43.280
Hurry, Ollie! We have to get that yarn!

04:43.400 --> 04:46.599
Oh, no! The yarn shop's closed!

04:47.039 --> 04:49.840
"Gone to watch the world
knitting record attempt.

04:50.000 --> 04:52.599
-Back tomorrow."
-This is terrible!

04:52.760 --> 04:54.599
We can't let Dolly and Zoom down!

04:54.760 --> 04:56.919
-We promised we'd help!
-And we will!

04:57.039 --> 04:58.800
If we can't buy the yarn,

04:58.919 --> 05:01.280
we'll have to go out
to the countryside and make it!

05:01.440 --> 05:04.560
Make it? You mean from the wool
that you get from sheep?

05:04.680 --> 05:06.280
Do you even know how to make yarn?

05:06.400 --> 05:08.520
Nope! But how hard could it be?

05:08.640 --> 05:11.760
Look! A bus to the countryside!

05:16.680 --> 05:18.080
There are the sheep.

05:18.360 --> 05:20.880
Now, let's get that wool!

05:21.440 --> 05:22.840
Where's the zipper?

05:23.000 --> 05:24.360
-Zipper?
-Sure!

05:24.520 --> 05:27.080
So we can take off
her wool coat! Is it here?

05:27.520 --> 05:29.200
-Baa!
-How about here?

05:29.359 --> 05:31.919
-Baa!
-Oops! She must be ticklish.

05:32.039 --> 05:35.200
Moon, I don't think sheep have zippers.

05:35.320 --> 05:36.880
Maybe we should check my book

05:37.000 --> 05:40.080
before we make a big mistake
and a bigger disaster!

05:40.200 --> 05:42.760
Say, if it's wool you want, I can help.

05:42.880 --> 05:45.840
All you need is shears
like these to clip it.

05:45.960 --> 05:48.520
Oh! Shears, like at the hairdresser!

05:48.640 --> 05:49.719
Sure! Sure!

05:49.840 --> 05:53.080
You know, I'd be happy
to share my wool with you kids

05:53.240 --> 05:55.719
if you could help me round up the sheep.

05:56.080 --> 05:58.280
-Well...
-Sure! It's a deal!

05:58.440 --> 06:00.200
Moon,
have you herded sheep before?

06:00.359 --> 06:03.120
Nope! But how hard could it be?
All right, sheep!

06:03.280 --> 06:04.760
-Time for haircuts!
-Baa!

06:04.919 --> 06:07.359
-Next customer, step right up!
-Baa!

06:07.479 --> 06:09.800
Free manicure with every haircut!

06:09.919 --> 06:10.760
Baa!

06:10.880 --> 06:12.719
And I'll throw in a deep ear clean!

06:12.840 --> 06:14.080
-Baa!
-Urgh!

06:14.200 --> 06:16.760
These are the pickiest customers
I've ever seen!

06:18.120 --> 06:20.120
Hmm. Ah!

06:20.320 --> 06:22.440
Maybe I should try
speaking their language.

06:22.560 --> 06:25.880
Baa, baa, baa,
baa-baa-baa-baa!

06:26.039 --> 06:27.640
-Baa!
-Uh-oh!

06:27.760 --> 06:29.840
I think you said something
you shouldn't have!

06:30.000 --> 06:31.520
They're upset!

06:31.680 --> 06:34.760
True, but at least now
they're all rounded up in the shed!

06:34.880 --> 06:37.200
Come here, you sheep! Hey, hey!
Get back here!

06:37.359 --> 06:40.880
Oh, don't look at me like that!
It's not that bad. Come on now.

06:41.039 --> 06:43.680
-Oh, you look great, honey!
-Baa!

06:44.640 --> 06:46.479
-Here's your wool!
-Thank you!

06:46.640 --> 06:49.960
-Thanks for your help.
-We did it, Ollie!

06:50.080 --> 06:52.359
Except the world-record attempt is nearly over,

06:52.479 --> 06:55.479
and according to this,
we still have to dye the wool purple!

06:55.599 --> 06:57.719
-On it!
-You know how to dye wool?

06:57.880 --> 06:59.719
Nope! But how hard could it be?

07:00.120 --> 07:02.599
I have a feeling I'm about to find out.

07:04.120 --> 07:06.719
Ooh, yeah... yeah! Mmm! Hmm...

07:07.479 --> 07:09.760
It's a little... off.

07:09.919 --> 07:11.640
Maybe some yellow dye.

07:12.719 --> 07:14.080
And green!

07:14.239 --> 07:17.080
-Nice, right?
-It's not exactly purple.

07:17.239 --> 07:20.039
No. It's better than purple!

07:20.200 --> 07:22.320
Now we just need to spin
the wool into yarn.

07:22.479 --> 07:24.239
With what? We don't have a--

07:24.400 --> 07:25.400
Spinning wheel?

07:26.039 --> 07:27.880
Now, how does this thing work?

07:28.000 --> 07:29.239
There we go!

07:29.359 --> 07:30.599
-Uh-oh!
-Ah!

07:30.760 --> 07:32.120
We don't know how to do this!

07:32.280 --> 07:35.760
We need expert tips to avoid disaster!

07:37.239 --> 07:40.120
I dunno. That oughta work.

07:40.239 --> 07:42.159
See! Look at me go, Ollie!

07:42.320 --> 07:45.919
-Whoa! Too fast! Too fast!
-And done!

07:46.080 --> 07:49.479
-Huh? Ollie? What happened?
-What happened?

07:49.599 --> 07:52.560
What happened is you didn't
give me time to read page 86.

07:52.719 --> 07:55.599
"Giant Yarn Ball Disasters
and How to Avoid Them."

07:55.719 --> 08:00.679
Yeah. There. Now let's go get
this yarn ball to our friends!

08:00.799 --> 08:01.640
-Ta-dah!
-Baa!

08:03.919 --> 08:06.640
What's wrong?
It's the size you wanted, right?

08:06.760 --> 08:09.640
Sure, but everything else is a mistake!

08:09.799 --> 08:12.320
It's not
the right texture or thickness

08:12.479 --> 08:14.359
and the colour doesn't match at all!

08:14.520 --> 08:18.880
Oh, goodbye, world record! It's over.

08:19.039 --> 08:21.599
No! Oh, wow.

08:21.760 --> 08:25.440
You're right, Ollie.
I've let Dolly and Zoom down.

08:25.599 --> 08:27.400
That's what I get
for trying to do things

08:27.560 --> 08:29.400
I don't know the first thing about.

08:29.520 --> 08:32.360
I... I... I failed.

08:32.559 --> 08:34.480
Actually, that's not true, Moon.

08:34.640 --> 08:36.840
You succeeded at new things all day!

08:37.039 --> 08:40.400
The sheep herding,
the yarn dying and the spinning!

08:40.520 --> 08:41.360
Yeah, but...

08:41.559 --> 08:43.600
So what if the yarn's not perfect?

08:43.760 --> 08:45.680
You showed me it's OK to make mistakes.

08:45.800 --> 08:49.240
Which is why I'm not giving up
on this world knitting record!

08:49.400 --> 08:52.319
-But, Ollie, you can't knit!
-Nope.

Ugh! [tutting]

Oh, no, no!
Your knitting is full of mistakes,

09:45.640 --> 09:50.560
lopsided, uneven, unsightly and terrible!

09:50.680 --> 09:55.319
-Aw...
-But there sure is a lot of it.

09:55.439 --> 09:58.480
Ahem! We have a new world record,

09:58.600 --> 10:01.439
but not for the biggest sweater!

10:01.720 --> 10:03.160
-Huh?
-No?

10:03.680 --> 10:07.000
It's for the biggest, weirdest,

10:07.400 --> 10:09.400
and most mismatched sweater...

10:10.120 --> 10:11.319
in the world.

-Hooray!

Uh-oh. Another bad connection?

[broken speech]

10:45.720 --> 10:47.439
Did they just say they need help

10:47.600 --> 10:49.480
with their flying poodle machine?

10:49.640 --> 10:51.360
We should call them back this time.

We should... or we could go
have a new adventure?
