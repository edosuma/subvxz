- What'd you give her?
- Leave him alone.

'Cause you're my daughter,

05:42.943 --> 05:44.376

06:28.989 --> 06:30.455

You ever think about that?

06:30.457 --> 06:32.157

06:32.159 --> 06:33.958
- Fuck you!

06:33.960 --> 06:36.061

talk to you like that?

06:36.063 --> 06:37.462
- Pop, go in the goddamn house!
- Shut up!

06:37.464 --> 06:39.196
- I got this under control!
- For Christ's...

06:39.198 --> 06:41.366
It ain't under control.
And stop using the F-word.

06:41.368 --> 06:42.701
Ray. Stay out of it.

06:42.703 --> 06:44.602

06:44.604 --> 06:46.438
No, Ma, I'm not

06:46.440 --> 06:48.573
I'm having a great fucking
day, as a matter of fact.

06:48.575 --> 06:50.408
My son and I walked into
the lion's den this morning,

06:50.410 --> 06:52.076
and walked out
with the Golden Fleece.

06:52.078 --> 06:53.345
Ain't that right, Ricky?

06:53.347 --> 06:54.612
- That's right.
- That's right.

06:54.614 --> 06:57.581

06:57.583 --> 07:01.352
Hey, put some clothes on, will you?
We're going for custard!

07:01.354 --> 07:03.455
- Richard?
- Yeah, Ma. What, Ma?

07:03.457 --> 07:06.325
- Help your father with the groceries.
- "Golden Fleece"?

07:06.327 --> 07:08.393
Will you tell me
what the fuck that means?

07:08.395 --> 07:11.129
I don't understand
what he says sometimes.

07:17.037 --> 07:18.270
These for the AKs?

07:18.272 --> 07:20.205
Yep.

07:20.207 --> 07:21.676
Why you waste
your time on them?

07:24.378 --> 07:27.746
Say, you pull through the drive-through
and you order a burger, right?

07:27.748 --> 07:29.580
Little girl in the paper hat,

07:29.582 --> 07:31.182
first thing she says to you is,
"Do you want fries with that?"

07:31.184 --> 07:33.051
Now, you didn't pull in
wanting fries,

07:33.053 --> 07:35.354
but now that she's planted the
idea in your head, you think,

07:35.356 --> 07:38.723
"Well, God damn! A burger just don't
taste right without fries, right?"

07:38.725 --> 07:41.460
The next thing
you know, you find yourself

07:41.462 --> 07:44.328
handing out your hard-earned
dollars to buy some fries

07:44.330 --> 07:47.499
that the little girl in
the paper hat ordered for you.

07:47.501 --> 07:50.167
Now, what'd she
just do to you?

07:50.169 --> 07:52.537
She just upsold your ass.

07:52.539 --> 07:55.306
So, you see,
the burger is like the AK.

07:55.308 --> 07:58.046
But the silencer,
that's the fries.

07:59.380 --> 08:02.246
All's we got to do,

08:02.248 --> 08:07.184
is make them believe that they
can't have one without the other.

08:17.530 --> 08:20.097
Rick.

08:20.099 --> 08:22.736

08:23.636 --> 08:27.641

08:29.208 --> 08:33.110

- Leaving? What?

08:33.111 --> 08:35.380
Here the number,
in case you need it.

08:35.381 --> 08:39.354
- Don't go giving it to Dad.
- It's Ty's, isn't it?

08:40.553 --> 08:42.554
Ty ain't got shit, Dawn.

08:42.556 --> 08:45.557

10:13.513 --> 10:15.313

11:26.320 --> 11:29.420

aircraft-grade aluminum.

13:26.873 --> 13:28.405
<i>♪ Shit, goddamn</i>

13:28.407 --> 13:30.674
<i>♪ Get off your ass and jam</i>

13:30.676 --> 13:33.011

13:35.415 --> 13:36.548
<i>♪ Shit, goddamn...</i>

13:36.550 --> 13:38.683
- Cathy!
- Yes.

13:38.685 --> 13:40.785
<i>♪ Shit, goddamn</i>

13:40.787 --> 13:43.487
<i>♪ Get off your ass
and jam... ♪</i>

13:43.489 --> 13:46.391
Better zip up, nigga, unless you
want my brother to cut it off.

13:46.393 --> 13:49.394
- Oh, shit, I'm sorry, bro.
- I'm just fucking with you.

13:51.465 --> 13:53.131
Listen, relax, wood. You ain't the first
to jack the beanstalk to that bitch.

13:54.768 --> 13:57.068
<i>♪ Get off your ass
and jam... ♪</i>

13:57.070 --> 13:59.536
- What up, boy?
- Nugg!

13:59.538 --> 14:02.707
Hey, Ricky!

14:02.709 --> 14:06.377
- Who are those two dudes over there?
- They cops.

14:06.379 --> 14:08.579
The one with the cigar,
that's Jimmy Harris.

14:08.581 --> 14:11.116
That's Cathy's bodyguard.

14:11.118 --> 14:14.051
Cathy's no nigga
from the hood.

14:14.053 --> 14:17.054
- That's Coleman Young's niece.
- Who?

14:17.056 --> 14:19.460
- The mayor!
- Oh!

14:21.094 --> 14:23.995
But don't Johnny
know they cops?

14:23.997 --> 14:26.097
Listen, this Detroit, wood.

14:26.099 --> 14:29.434
If you ain't on the take,
you getting your ass took.

14:31.104 --> 14:33.604
<i>♪ Feel the heat</i>

14:33.606 --> 14:37.074

14:37.076 --> 14:40.812

14:40.814 --> 14:43.481
<i>♪ Get... Get down</i>

14:43.483 --> 14:45.449
<i>♪ Get down ♪</i>

14:45.451 --> 14:47.419
I seen some of the
faces around, but like I said,

14:47.421 --> 14:49.053
I don't know any of them
by name.

14:49.055 --> 14:51.823
They don't go near my shit,
and I don't go near theirs.

14:51.825 --> 14:53.924
What exactly is your shit?

14:53.926 --> 14:56.560
We have you ID'd
at a gun show

14:56.562 --> 14:59.966
- last month in Ohio.
- Yeah. So?

15:01.100 --> 15:02.900
I got my FFL. I'm legit.

15:02.902 --> 15:05.837
You might have a
license to sell firearms, Rick,

15:05.839 --> 15:09.473
but I think we can both agree
that you're not legit.

15:09.475 --> 15:13.144
Frank, I've never sold an unregistered
weapon to anybody. Not knowingly.

15:13.146 --> 15:15.646
And I've got papers
on every piece to prove it.

15:15.648 --> 15:17.915
You got the papers
on the silencers?

15:17.917 --> 15:20.584
'Cause that makes it
manufacturing.

15:20.586 --> 15:23.054
Then you got possession,
you got distribution.

15:23.056 --> 15:27.759
That's a 10-year ticket, Rick. You
want to go away for 10 years?

15:27.761 --> 15:30.527
Come on. You sure
you don't recognize anyone?

15:30.529 --> 15:31.996
Come on, guys, look.

15:31.998 --> 15:33.964
I'm just a dad trying
to do right by his kids.

15:33.966 --> 15:36.000
Two or three years,
I make my stake.

15:36.002 --> 15:37.669
I open up some video stores,

15:37.671 --> 15:40.572
I'm getting the kids out of
here, take 'em someplace nice.

15:40.574 --> 15:43.141
And besides, I live here.

15:43.143 --> 15:45.175
And you don't think
one of these scumbags

15:45.177 --> 15:46.844
will sell you out in a second?

15:46.846 --> 15:49.079
- I don't know any of 'em.
- Why are you protecting them?

15:49.081 --> 15:52.049
- I'm not...
- What about you?

15:52.051 --> 15:53.818
Rick,
go back in your bedroom.

15:53.820 --> 15:55.786
No, guys, leave my
fucking kid out of this.

15:55.788 --> 15:57.020
It's all right.

15:57.022 --> 15:58.823
No, it's not.
Ricky, back to your bedroom.

15:58.825 --> 16:00.123
- Hold on a second.
- Frank.

16:00.125 --> 16:01.492
- Kid.
- Frank.

16:01.494 --> 16:02.863
Come here.

16:07.801 --> 16:11.736
Hi. Let's see if you can
help me out.

16:11.738 --> 16:14.675
Do you know any
of these guys by name?

16:16.109 --> 16:19.513
- No.
- You didn't look.

16:21.715 --> 16:23.684
Take your time.

16:26.519 --> 16:31.191
This guy dead. He's been dead,
like, maybe two months, now.

16:38.998 --> 16:40.567
He's dead, too.

16:45.070 --> 16:48.875
So, that's all you got for me?
Two dead guys.

16:57.950 --> 16:59.720
What about him?

17:02.922 --> 17:04.223
You know him?

17:05.925 --> 17:08.792
- No.
- You sure?

17:08.795 --> 17:11.031
He said he's sure.

17:12.731 --> 17:14.265
I think that's enough
for the day.

17:14.267 --> 17:17.868
Why don't you two
get the fuck out of our house.

17:17.871 --> 17:20.871
You know,
the whole "acting hard" thing,

17:20.873 --> 17:23.641
- doesn't really suit you, Rick.
- It's okay.

17:23.643 --> 17:27.046
We're done.
Thank you both for your time.

17:30.616 --> 17:32.552
Thanks again.

17:41.126 --> 17:43.127
- He said what?
- So crazy.

17:43.129 --> 17:45.295
Steve, the only bad bitch
you know is your auntie,

17:45.297 --> 17:47.698
and that's because she done
been to jail three times.

17:47.700 --> 17:50.634
Three times?
I thought it was twice.

17:50.636 --> 17:52.135
Look, it's all right,
it's all right.

17:52.137 --> 17:54.171
- All of us, all of us fuck up.
- Yo, yo, yo.

17:54.173 --> 17:56.873
Hey, I think there's some shit
under there, bro.

17:56.875 --> 17:58.875
- Yeah?
- I think it... Hey.

17:58.877 --> 18:00.844
- Wait, wait, wait, boy.
- Hold on. Hold on.

18:00.846 --> 18:02.913
- Y'all ready?
- Whatever it is, I'm shooting it.

18:02.915 --> 18:04.284
- Come on.
- The fuck out of here.

18:10.190 --> 18:12.023
Oh!

18:12.025 --> 18:13.256
What happened?

18:13.258 --> 18:14.993
Hey!

18:14.995 --> 18:17.027
No! No!

18:17.029 --> 18:18.362
- Hey!
- Look at the hand, though.

18:18.364 --> 18:20.297
No, fuck the hand!
Look at my shirt!

18:20.299 --> 18:22.135
I got to go fucking change.

19:01.941 --> 19:03.940
It's not a real
strong look, Ricky.

19:03.942 --> 19:05.677
Look, I don't know
where my dad is.

19:05.679 --> 19:07.344
We're not
here to see your dad.

19:07.346 --> 19:09.781
- Why don't you get in the car?
- For what?

19:09.783 --> 19:12.786
I got someone I want you
to meet. Get in the car.

19:14.187 --> 19:16.123
I'm trying to get
the fuck home.

19:20.125 --> 19:22.727
Ricky, this is Jackson.

19:22.729 --> 19:24.795
Detroit PD,
Narcotics Division.

19:24.797 --> 19:26.900
Jackson, Ricky.

19:34.873 --> 19:36.340
Ricky, you know who

19:36.342 --> 19:39.209
the first lady of
the United States is, right?

19:39.211 --> 19:40.948
You know what she says
about drugs?

19:42.114 --> 19:43.814
"Just say no."

19:43.816 --> 19:45.949
That's right.

19:45.951 --> 19:49.920
Problem is we got
too many people saying yes.

19:49.922 --> 19:52.425
- Especially on the East Side.
- You got fries?

19:57.096 --> 19:59.096
You ever use
crack cocaine, Rick?

19:59.098 --> 20:01.234
- No.
- You know what it look like?

20:02.402 --> 20:04.901
- Ketchup.
- There's no ketchup.

20:04.903 --> 20:07.104
Who the fuck buys fries
and no ketchup?

20:07.106 --> 20:08.208
Look.

20:09.808 --> 20:11.775
Here's a pie, okay?

20:11.777 --> 20:13.844
I don't want no fucking pie.
I want ketchup.

20:13.846 --> 20:15.246
Hey, man, fuck the pie
and the ketchup.

20:15.248 --> 20:16.749
Man, just eat
the damn fries.

20:19.384 --> 20:22.152
Get your arm
off the bird.

20:22.154 --> 20:25.022
It's a gift
for my sister, asshole.

20:25.024 --> 20:27.458
Hey, how is
your sister, Ricky?

20:27.460 --> 20:29.360
When was the last time
you saw her?

20:29.362 --> 20:30.928
You don't want to get

20:30.930 --> 20:32.429
the motherfuckers
that sell to your sister?

20:32.431 --> 20:34.265
Yo, stop fucking
playing with me.

20:34.267 --> 20:36.167
You know, fuck this shit.
I'm gone.

20:36.169 --> 20:37.535
Who the fuck you think
you are, you little punk?

20:37.537 --> 20:39.035
Jackson.

20:39.037 --> 20:41.205
- Feed you my fucking fist.
- Jackson.

20:41.207 --> 20:42.873
Let him go. Jackson.

20:42.875 --> 20:45.179
Ricky, we just want to
show you something, okay?

20:47.846 --> 20:50.348
Man, what's up with you people
and photographs?

20:50.350 --> 20:52.416
I supposed to know
who this is?

20:52.418 --> 20:54.951
He was shot twice
in the back of the head.

20:54.953 --> 20:56.956
Think that's news
on the East Side?

20:58.123 --> 21:00.056
We haven't found
the killer yet,

21:00.058 --> 21:01.494
but we did find the weapon.

21:02.362 --> 21:04.294
.40 caliber.

21:04.296 --> 21:05.529
This particular weapon

21:05.531 --> 21:07.965
was purchased at a gun show
earlier this year.

21:07.967 --> 21:09.970
By a licensed dealer.

21:12.538 --> 21:16.573
Your father
is a businessman,

21:16.575 --> 21:19.142
who happens to have
some clients

21:19.144 --> 21:21.211
that are total
fucking scumbags.

21:21.213 --> 21:23.514
But the good news is
the only people who know

21:23.516 --> 21:26.817
about this problem
are sitting in this vehicle.

21:26.819 --> 21:28.287
Which is good for you.

21:35.527 --> 21:37.163
For the moment.

21:38.597 --> 21:40.366
It's really
up to you, though.

21:54.346 --> 21:57.281
<i>You're gonna buy drugs for us.</i>

21:57.283 --> 21:59.917
<i>You're gonna do what
we call controlled buys.</i>

21:59.919 --> 22:02.419
<i>It's gonna help us determine
where the drugs are being sold,</i>

22:02.421 --> 22:03.987
<i>so we can get warrants.</i>

22:03.989 --> 22:05.858
This is fucked up.

22:08.361 --> 22:09.563
So, what's my take?

22:10.864 --> 22:12.630
$200.

22:12.632 --> 22:14.497
Three.

22:14.499 --> 22:17.037
Fine. But
only if you make five buys.

22:17.937 --> 22:19.503
All right.

22:21.173 --> 22:22.372
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Shit!

22:22.374 --> 22:24.475
Hey! No firearms.

22:24.477 --> 22:26.244
- You all got 'em.
- Yeah, 'cause I'm

22:26.246 --> 22:28.112
the motherfucking PD and
they're the motherfucking FBI,

22:28.114 --> 22:29.546
- you little motherfucker.
- Then why don't

22:29.548 --> 22:30.981
the motherfucking PD
and the motherfucking FBI

22:30.983 --> 22:32.385
walk they asses down there?

22:37.556 --> 22:40.027
- We got your back, Rick.
- Blow me.

23:09.055 --> 23:11.255
Let me get two dimes.

23:11.257 --> 23:13.291
You don't look like no smoker.

23:13.293 --> 23:14.527
It's for my sister.

23:15.394 --> 23:16.496
Sister.

23:17.663 --> 23:18.662
She fine?

23:18.664 --> 23:20.564
Why you care if she fine?

23:20.566 --> 23:23.935
Well, if she fine,
she give me a little taste.

23:23.937 --> 23:26.173
Man, fuck you.
Just give me the goddamn rock.

23:49.662 --> 23:52.431
Hope your
sister likes the duck, kid.

23:57.502 --> 24:00.271
Hey, Scarface.

24:00.273 --> 24:01.508
Forget something?

24:06.645 --> 24:08.612
Keep that safety on.

24:08.614 --> 24:11.384
Nighty-night, Rick.

24:20.393 --> 24:22.560
<i>Good to see you again, Frank.</i>

24:22.562 --> 24:24.128
<i>That's it.
I've had it. I'm finished.</i>

24:24.130 --> 24:25.262
<i>- What's wrong?
- I can't take it anymore.</i>

24:25.264 --> 24:26.630
<i>I got to get out.</i>

24:26.632 --> 24:28.064
<i>If I have to go back
to uniform,</i>

24:28.066 --> 24:29.432
<i>I'm going back to uniform.</i>

24:29.434 --> 24:31.035
<i>I can't wait
for Delaney to call,</i>

24:31.037 --> 24:32.570
<i>and I can't
play their game anymore.</i>

24:32.572 --> 24:35.072
<i>I'm right in the middle.
I can't take it.</i>

24:35.074 --> 24:37.108
<i>You mean to say the commissioner
didn't get in touch with you?</i>

24:37.110 --> 24:38.476
<i>No, he didn't get in
touch with me, not a word.</i>

24:38.478 --> 24:39.576
<i>No investigation,
no undercover work!</i>

24:39.578 --> 24:41.512
<i>I had no idea, Frank.</i>

24:41.514 --> 24:43.046
<i>Well, Captain, I think
it's only fair to tell you.</i>

24:43.048 --> 24:44.414
<i>I've been to outside agencies.</i>

24:44.416 --> 24:46.252
<i>I'm-a go to more if I have to.</i>

25:09.709 --> 25:12.308
How I'm supposed to know
where any of this stuff been?

25:12.310 --> 25:14.378
What you care about
where it been at, Boo?

25:14.380 --> 25:16.781
I don't like wearing
other people's shit.

25:16.783 --> 25:18.681
Especially if
I don't know 'em, man.

25:18.683 --> 25:21.151
I... Come on,
what the fuck is that?

25:21.153 --> 25:22.452
Here we go.

25:22.454 --> 25:23.687
Brand-new shit, nigga.

25:23.689 --> 25:25.355
That's for you.
That's for you.

25:25.357 --> 25:27.158
Thank you.

25:27.160 --> 25:30.529
- Say, Boo.
- Try this shit.

25:31.530 --> 25:33.496
Hey, Rick.

25:33.498 --> 25:35.766
What's up?

25:35.768 --> 25:38.502
When you came to the garage
with your little knapsack

25:38.504 --> 25:41.505
full of AKs,
your daddy put you up to it?

25:41.507 --> 25:44.441
Don't be thinking about what
the right answer is, Rick.

25:44.443 --> 25:47.346
- There's only one right answer.
- No.

25:49.614 --> 25:53.316
Me and Leo, our story written.
We can't erase that, but Boo...

25:53.318 --> 25:55.585
Boo's a blank page.
Boo can write his own story

25:55.587 --> 25:57.787
as long as don't nobody
fuck it up.

25:57.789 --> 26:00.091
You understand
what I'm saying?

26:00.093 --> 26:01.691
Boo's my best friend.

26:01.693 --> 26:03.662
I wouldn't do anything
to hurt him.

26:11.571 --> 26:12.870
What you think about that?

26:12.872 --> 26:14.775
- I like the color.
- Yeah, try it on.

26:25.852 --> 26:28.718
Jesus Christ.
Who the fuck died?

26:28.720 --> 26:30.854
Johnny Curry's
getting married.

26:30.856 --> 26:33.189
- Told you weeks ago, remember?
- That's right.

26:33.191 --> 26:34.691
To the mayor's daughter,
right?

26:34.693 --> 26:36.829
- To the niece.
- The niece?

26:38.264 --> 26:39.563
So, where's it at?

26:39.565 --> 26:42.466
- The wedding.
- I don't know.

26:42.468 --> 26:45.602
Fancy place Johnny calls
"The Manure House."

26:45.604 --> 26:49.172
The Manoogian Mansion?
That's the mayor's house.

26:49.174 --> 26:51.208
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

26:51.210 --> 26:53.544
- Damn.
- Yeah.

26:53.546 --> 26:55.446
Say, what do you say
I go with you?

26:55.448 --> 26:57.348
- What?
- I got a friend, Pete Van De Car,

26:57.350 --> 26:58.815
owns a little tux shop
out on the highway.

26:58.817 --> 27:01.854
He could set me up in an hour.
I could meet you there.

27:03.556 --> 27:05.256
That'd be great.

27:05.258 --> 27:08.225
But I think it's one of those
invitation-only deals,

27:08.227 --> 27:09.262
you know?

27:11.463 --> 27:12.862
Yeah. Yeah, right.

Are you watching this?

30:22.054 --> 30:23.422
Nope.

30:26.959 --> 30:28.862
Let me hit that
one more time.

30:34.900 --> 30:36.503
I thought you was dead.

30:37.870 --> 30:39.503
I mean, that's the way
it mostly be

30:39.505 --> 30:43.841
when somebody stop coming
to school, dead, in jail.

30:43.843 --> 30:45.312
I just been busy.

30:46.812 --> 30:48.911
What you been
busy with, Ricky?

30:48.913 --> 30:52.048
- Thinking about you.
- Don't act like you got game.

30:52.050 --> 30:53.852
You know you ain't
never had game.

30:54.987 --> 30:56.120
Science.

30:56.122 --> 30:59.422
- Science?
- Yeah, science.

30:59.424 --> 31:02.461
That's the class we had
together. With Mrs. Halladay.

31:03.929 --> 31:06.796
I used to sit
right behind you in school.

31:06.798 --> 31:09.501
You had all these ribbons
tied in your hair.

31:10.669 --> 31:12.803
All different type of colors.

31:12.805 --> 31:15.008
I used to just look at 'em
all through class.

31:16.741 --> 31:18.108
Must've been pretty bored

31:18.110 --> 31:20.811
to be looking at the back
of my head all class long.

31:20.813 --> 31:23.447
Yeah, I guess.

31:23.449 --> 31:27.016
But they was pretty, though,
the ribbons.

31:27.018 --> 31:29.186
My grandma tied those
in my hair.

31:29.188 --> 31:31.925
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

31:45.805 --> 31:47.970
Don't worry,
we gonna take it slow.

31:47.972 --> 31:50.710
No shit we be
taking it slow.

32:02.688 --> 32:04.822
Fuck if I know.

32:04.824 --> 32:07.757
Look like
a million dollars to me.

32:07.759 --> 32:09.092
All right, look.

32:09.094 --> 32:10.462
There's one other thing.

32:11.697 --> 32:13.800
- What is this?
- Consider it a bonus.

32:15.200 --> 32:17.734
Dude, my dad finds this,
he'll kick my ass.

32:17.736 --> 32:19.535
Just make sure
he doesn't find it, then.

32:19.537 --> 32:20.737
A new jack like
your ass is buying

32:20.739 --> 32:22.672
and you ain't pushing,
word gets around.

32:22.674 --> 32:25.144
First y'all got me buying,
now y'all got me selling?

32:27.512 --> 32:29.179
Listen to Jackson,
all right?

32:29.181 --> 32:31.515
You know what?
Fine. Fuck it.

32:31.517 --> 32:34.250
You know what's in this bag?
Four grand.

32:34.252 --> 32:37.054
Shit, I'll sell it myself.

32:37.056 --> 32:39.726
- I get to bank it? The money?
- All yours.

32:46.164 --> 32:50.100
<i>Break it down to dime rocks.</i>

32:50.102 --> 32:53.135
- <i>Get yourself a crew and offload it.</i>
- Looks good.

32:53.137 --> 32:55.707
<i>Before long,
people'll know you legit.</i>

32:56.909 --> 32:58.641
<i>You legit, you're safe.</i>

32:58.643 --> 32:59.845
Yeah?

33:03.681 --> 33:05.884
He definitely
hooked us up this time.

33:10.288 --> 33:11.723
One.

33:25.170 --> 33:27.537
Her asshole boyfriend's
stepping out on her.

33:27.539 --> 33:29.573
This would not scare me, if I pointed
this at you, would this scare you?

33:29.575 --> 33:31.108
This does not seem scary
to me at all.

33:31.110 --> 33:32.843
Listen, I promise you that'll
scare any man you aim it at,

33:32.845 --> 33:34.544
but if you want something
a little more

33:34.546 --> 33:35.746
visually intimidating and also
has a little more horsepower,

33:35.748 --> 33:36.880
- try that on for size.
- Yes.

33:36.882 --> 33:38.282
Yeah.

33:38.284 --> 33:39.983
Ladies, I do want you to know
that I am about

33:39.985 --> 33:41.250
- responsible gun ownership, okay?
- Yeah, yeah.

33:41.252 --> 33:42.585
I'm not looking
to take him out or anything.

33:42.587 --> 33:44.054
I'm just looking
for an apology.

33:44.056 --> 33:45.689
Okay, I want this one.
How much is this one?

33:45.691 --> 33:47.925
Usually 1,200. I can
give it to you for a grand.

33:47.927 --> 33:49.496
$1,000? Okay.

34:42.746 --> 34:45.315
Those motherfuckers came to
you behind my back, Ricky?

34:45.317 --> 34:48.250
- What?
- I saw you in the car.

34:48.252 --> 34:51.087
And you went along with it?
You're my son.

34:51.089 --> 34:52.888
They was gonna
put your ass in jail.

34:52.889 --> 34:55.859
Then let 'em put
my ass in jail!

34:55.860 --> 34:58.094
That's my box. You been
going through my shit?

34:58.096 --> 34:59.895
Yeah, I've been going
through your shit.

34:59.897 --> 35:01.765
You know how much
goddamn money's in that box?

35:01.767 --> 35:03.667
$9,782.

35:03.669 --> 35:06.402
Now, how's a goddamn
15-year-old boy have $9,782

35:06.404 --> 35:08.739
without his goddamn dad
knowing about it?

35:08.741 --> 35:09.940
You know, you ought to be

35:09.942 --> 35:11.777

35:13.412 --> 35:16.913
Man, fuck it! Keep the money!
You need it more than I do!

35:16.915 --> 35:19.085
Use it to go open up
your fucking movie store!

35:20.419 --> 35:22.855
Dawn's right!
You're a fucking loser!

35:24.189 --> 35:25.825
What happened, Rick?

36:35.393 --> 36:37.359
Double burger.

36:37.361 --> 36:39.965
Boy didn't last
five months.

36:41.500 --> 36:44.237
- Hey.
- The fuck?

36:46.404 --> 36:48.404
- What's with the bird?
- It's for you.

36:48.406 --> 36:50.343
What, you don't like it?

36:52.810 --> 36:54.745
You don't look
so good, Dawn.

36:54.747 --> 36:57.417
Well, fuck you, too.

37:01.220 --> 37:03.420
Ty's an asshole, Dawn.

37:03.422 --> 37:05.922
Maybe you should
think about coming home.

37:05.924 --> 37:07.757
I can't, Ricky.

37:07.759 --> 37:09.426
I can't do that.

37:09.428 --> 37:13.496
- Tyler's fucking you up.
- No, it ain't Ty fucking me up.

37:13.498 --> 37:15.868
Dawn, I need you
to come home.

37:16.502 --> 37:18.237
What's going on?

37:19.471 --> 37:20.803
You into something?

37:20.805 --> 37:22.741
No, it's just I...

37:23.875 --> 37:25.143
I fucking miss you.

37:28.913 --> 37:31.413
You didn't leave the keys
in Grandpa's car, did you?

37:31.415 --> 37:32.451
Oh, fuck me!

37:37.522 --> 37:40.225
- Fuck!
- Shit! I almost got him!

37:41.794 --> 37:43.225
Down!

37:43.227 --> 37:44.960
Drop the firearm!

37:44.962 --> 37:46.395
- Get on the ground.
- Down!

37:46.397 --> 37:48.064
Spread 'em!

37:48.066 --> 37:49.866
I swear to God, I'll blow
your fucking brains out.

37:49.868 --> 37:51.201
- Get your hand back here.
- The fuck are you thinking?

37:51.203 --> 37:52.902
He took my grandfather's car!

37:52.904 --> 37:54.306
Shut the fuck up!

37:56.174 --> 37:59.141
Good seeing you,

38:06.919 --> 38:08.551
What are they
charging me with?

38:08.553 --> 38:10.520
Operating a vehicle
without a license,

38:10.522 --> 38:13.556
carrying a concealed weapon,
assault, attempted murder.

38:13.558 --> 38:15.491
Basically being a total
fucking dumbass, Ricky.

38:15.493 --> 38:16.960
- Murder?
- Yeah.

38:16.962 --> 38:19.228
The guy stole
my grandfather's car.

38:19.230 --> 38:21.431
This is fucking bullshit!

38:21.433 --> 38:24.067
Look, take it easy, okay?
This is what's gonna happen.

38:24.069 --> 38:26.102
The court is gonna
assign you a date.

38:26.104 --> 38:28.038
You're gonna show up,
everyone's gonna be there,

38:28.040 --> 38:29.506
except for
the arresting officer,

38:29.508 --> 38:31.910
so all the charges
are gonna be dropped, okay?

38:33.879 --> 38:36.078
- What about my sister?
- She walked.

38:36.080 --> 38:38.116
We told 'em
the gun was yours.

38:57.102 --> 39:00.203
Where's my Imperial, Ricky?

39:00.205 --> 39:02.371
Where's my goddamn car, Ricky?

39:03.642 --> 39:05.641
I know you can hear me,
you prick.

39:05.643 --> 39:08.210
Get out of the car.

39:08.212 --> 39:11.348
Don't be an asshole on me,
Ricky, every fucking day!

39:11.350 --> 39:14.016
Get out of the car,
talk to me,

39:14.018 --> 39:15.886
and tell me what your...

39:15.888 --> 39:17.486
As you can see, your
grandfather's a tad upset.

39:17.488 --> 39:19.890
Get out of your car
and talk to me!

39:19.892 --> 39:22.160
He's got every right to be.

39:23.495 --> 39:25.629
I didn't steal his car.
I borrowed it.

39:25.631 --> 39:27.631
It was stolen from me.

39:27.633 --> 39:31.268
Well, be that as it may, Rick,
your grandparents are currently

39:31.270 --> 39:33.502
without means
of transportation.

39:33.504 --> 39:36.339
What I'm saying is
there have been consequences

39:36.341 --> 39:38.511
to your actions
of last night.

39:41.078 --> 39:45.218
I understand
how you feel about Dawn.

39:47.252 --> 39:50.085
It's tearing me up, too.

39:50.087 --> 39:51.457
Then why don't you
go get her?

40:05.937 --> 40:08.203
Y'all
niggas is not funny, bro.

40:08.205 --> 40:10.674
Hey, you need to beat
your pastor, your mama

40:10.676 --> 40:13.410

bought you them damn shoes.

40:13.412 --> 40:14.346
What's up, guys?

40:17.549 --> 40:21.654
Rick. Let's talk, man.

40:31.163 --> 40:33.462
What they charge
you with, Rick?

40:33.464 --> 40:35.732
Attempted murder.
Some bullshit. I don't know.

40:35.734 --> 40:37.667
You don't know?

40:37.669 --> 40:40.170
You say that shit
like you ain't even tripping.

40:40.172 --> 40:42.105
You good, Rick,
at talking like a nigga,

40:42.107 --> 40:44.442
but you don't know the first
thing it is to live like one.

40:47.044 --> 40:49.578
What you tell 'em, Rick?

40:49.580 --> 40:52.248
I didn't tell 'em nothing,
Johnny. For real.

40:52.250 --> 40:54.283
I mean, the motherfucker
stole my grandpa's car,

40:54.285 --> 40:56.518
and I was just trying
to stop him from getting away.

40:56.520 --> 40:58.687
You think one of us
shoot up your granddaddy's car,

40:58.689 --> 41:01.257
they let us walk?

41:01.259 --> 41:02.692
Hmm?

41:02.694 --> 41:05.261
If I find out you got Boo
mixed up in this, Rick,

41:05.263 --> 41:07.763
I will personally correct
your ass. You understand?

41:07.765 --> 41:09.665
Mixed up in what?

41:09.667 --> 41:11.937
We know, Rick.

41:13.038 --> 41:15.071
Nobody last
10 years in the game

41:15.073 --> 41:16.672
without knowing
fuck all going on.

41:16.674 --> 41:18.977
We know.

41:21.712 --> 41:23.212
You cop from our houses,

41:23.214 --> 41:24.748
and then you out there
grinding on your own.

41:24.750 --> 41:26.518
You ain't think
we was gonna find out?

41:28.120 --> 41:29.551
I'm sorry, Johnny.

41:29.553 --> 41:31.388
I had no idea
they were your houses.

41:31.390 --> 41:33.123
650 grams, Rick.

41:33.125 --> 41:34.591
That's all it take
to land your ass,

41:34.593 --> 41:36.426
my ass, and all
your buddies out there

41:36.428 --> 41:38.527
on the inside
for the rest of our lives.

41:38.529 --> 41:40.062
Shit, you better off
murdering somebody

41:40.064 --> 41:41.431
in the state of Michigan.

41:41.433 --> 41:43.565
So if you holding
even one fucking gram,

41:43.567 --> 41:46.368
you don't come anywhere near
me or mine, you understand?

41:46.370 --> 41:50.140
They haul your ass,
you doing white time.

41:50.142 --> 41:52.509
They haul any of our asses,
we doing black time.

41:52.511 --> 41:54.544
So don't be reckless
around here.

41:54.546 --> 41:57.316
You want to move weight?
Come to me.

41:59.283 --> 42:01.319
From now on,
stay away from the houses.

42:02.754 --> 42:05.254
Feds always be
watching the houses.

42:05.256 --> 42:07.025
You understand?

42:08.125 --> 42:09.761
Yeah.

42:16.734 --> 42:19.335
Leon, you still owe
what you owe.

42:19.337 --> 42:21.703
This just buy you
a little layaway time.

42:21.705 --> 42:23.739
I understand you, brother.

42:23.741 --> 42:26.509
Like I said,
I'm waiting on one man.

42:26.511 --> 42:29.178
When that one man pay me,
then I pay y'all.

42:29.180 --> 42:31.147
When you boys
get back from Vegas,

42:31.149 --> 42:32.714
we could square it away,
a'ight?

42:32.716 --> 42:34.650
You know my wife coming,
right, Leon?

42:34.652 --> 42:36.652
Hey, I told you
I got you covered, man.

42:36.654 --> 42:38.288
You and your beautiful wife.

42:38.290 --> 42:40.489
Look, everybody on the ropes.

42:40.491 --> 42:42.257
Ringside, man.

42:42.259 --> 42:44.694
I got family that work
for Tommy Hearns' camp.

42:44.696 --> 42:47.696
Tommy Hearns know
you boys coming, man.

42:47.698 --> 42:49.299
Tommy Hearns know we coming?

42:49.301 --> 42:52.167
Hell, yeah.
Tommy Hearns know you coming.

42:52.169 --> 42:53.571
You boys is famous.

42:57.408 --> 43:01.079
Leon, make sure you got
every cent when we get back.

43:19.663 --> 43:21.797
Yo, I've never
seen this before.

43:21.799 --> 43:23.466
And you ready, right?

43:23.468 --> 43:25.638
Are you ready for this city?

43:31.176 --> 43:33.345
Now, God damn it!

44:41.513 --> 44:43.812
Leon Lucas, all right?
He Tommy Hearns' cousin.

44:43.814 --> 44:46.549
Tommy made the arrangements
himself, all right? Ringside.

44:46.551 --> 44:48.551
Sir, I show that
all the VIP seats

44:48.553 --> 44:51.420
have already been claimed.

44:51.422 --> 44:53.989
Now, I'm gonna have
to ask you to step aside.

44:53.991 --> 44:55.725
Ooh, Johnny!

44:55.727 --> 44:57.694
Look like we got
your tickets, Lil Man.

45:04.669 --> 45:06.703
<i>Another right hand!</i>

45:06.705 --> 45:08.337
- For real?
- Yo!

45:08.339 --> 45:09.906
<i>- Hearns turns his back!
- Get your ass up.</i>

45:09.908 --> 45:11.007
<i>- Takes another right!
- Come on, man!</i>

45:11.009 --> 45:12.408
What the fuck?

45:12.410 --> 45:14.277
- No! No!
- Bro, come on!

45:14.279 --> 45:15.812
<i>- Takes another right!</i>
<i>- Don't start bank...</i>

45:15.814 --> 45:16.980
- No!
- <i>Hearns in deep trouble again!</i>

45:16.982 --> 45:18.348
<i>- Hearns is down!
- Damn!</i>

45:18.350 --> 45:19.781
- Fuck!
- Oh, my God!

45:19.783 --> 45:21.484
<i>Tommy Hearns tries
to get up and he...</i>

45:21.486 --> 45:22.986
- They got to stop this fight.
- What the fuck!

45:22.988 --> 45:24.920
I don't know why we going
to this Art Derrick party

45:24.922 --> 45:27.422

the motherfucking fight.

45:27.424 --> 45:29.891
Everybody at the party
gonna been at the fight.

45:29.893 --> 45:32.527
You can drag your ass back
to Detroit tonight, Leo.

45:32.529 --> 45:34.263
I ain't going back
to Detroit tonight.

45:34.265 --> 45:35.732
I'm going to
the fucking party.

45:35.734 --> 45:38.468
And don't act like you didn't
get played by Leon, too.

45:38.470 --> 45:40.339
He made both you niggas
look stupid.

45:51.049 --> 45:53.382
I ain't see
why he hit that fool, man.

45:53.384 --> 45:55.317
That was crazy, man.

45:55.319 --> 45:56.953
That was the best fight ever.

46:09.933 --> 46:11.567
I ain't Artie, man.

46:11.569 --> 46:14.437
Shit! I thought you was
my son for a minute.

46:14.439 --> 46:16.973
- Wait, you're not, are you?
- Hell, no!

46:16.975 --> 46:19.308
- You Art Derrick, right?
- Yeah, last time I checked.

46:19.310 --> 46:21.076
But I'm hopelessly unreliable.

46:21.078 --> 46:22.978
Just ask my last few wives.

46:22.980 --> 46:24.781
Hey, wait a minute.
You're Johnny's boy.

46:24.783 --> 46:26.315
White Boy Rick.

46:26.317 --> 46:27.984
- Yeah, that's right.
- Well, any friend of Johnny's

46:27.986 --> 46:30.553

46:30.555 --> 46:32.654
I'm just fucking with you!
Johnny's solid.

46:32.656 --> 46:34.524
He and Leo are

46:34.526 --> 46:36.558
And you're only as good

46:36.560 --> 46:37.660
Remember that.

46:37.662 --> 46:39.562
Look me up sometime.

46:39.564 --> 46:41.631
Oh, thank you.
But we didn't order this.

46:41.633 --> 46:42.864
It's from the man
by the bar.

46:42.866 --> 46:44.366
Oh, Johnny.

46:44.368 --> 46:46.335
Why you looking all down?

<i>Damion and Frankie Lucas
were here alone,</i>

<i>watching television.</i>

<i>The home is owned
by their uncle, Leon Lucas.</i>

48:34.479 --> 48:37.814
<i>28 shots were fired

48:47.125 --> 48:49.024
<i>Please come
to 3344 Judith Drive.</i>

48:49.026 --> 48:51.194
- <i>I don't know what to do!</i>
- That's right over here.

48:51.196 --> 48:52.995
<i>We have also
learned that Leon Lucas</i>

48:52.997 --> 48:54.029
<i>has a criminal record

49:14.618 --> 49:16.551
Ha! Jesus, Ricky.

49:16.553 --> 49:18.553
Are you trying
to get yourself shot?

49:18.555 --> 49:21.491
I'm looking for a gun.
Grandma keeps hiding mine.

49:21.493 --> 49:24.694
No offense, Dad,
but you look like shit.

49:24.696 --> 49:28.064
I'm old and poor, Rick.
What's your excuse?

49:28.066 --> 49:29.998
When did you get back
from Vegas?

49:30.000 --> 49:31.701
It's a long way to go
to see somebody

49:31.703 --> 49:33.201
get their ass kicked
in three rounds, isn't it?

49:33.203 --> 49:35.103
Well, I actually
didn't catch the fight.

49:35.105 --> 49:37.806
You know, I played a little
blackjack, met a girl.

49:37.808 --> 49:40.643
- A nice Jewish girl.
- Jewish?

49:40.645 --> 49:43.047
Yeah. Seeing as
how you've converted.

49:44.883 --> 49:47.986
The star, Ricky.
It's Jewish.

49:49.620 --> 49:51.520
What the fuck?

49:51.522 --> 49:53.890
How stupid are these guys
you're hanging around with?

49:53.892 --> 49:55.091
How stupid are you?

49:55.093 --> 49:56.859
I mean, at least
they ain't old and poor.

49:56.861 --> 49:58.294
Least they ain't borrowing
money from their parents.

49:58.296 --> 50:01.066
Shit, their parents probably
borrowing money from them.

50:06.703 --> 50:09.140
There's a .38
on top of the vent.

50:14.779 --> 50:16.712
I want you to go
back to school, Ricky.

50:16.714 --> 50:18.517
Hear me?

50:20.183 --> 50:22.118
These guys
you're hanging around with,

50:22.120 --> 50:23.618
you're gonna
get in too deep.

50:23.620 --> 50:25.154
And then they ain't gonna
let you out.

50:25.156 --> 50:27.860
Who, Dad?
The Currys or the cops?

50:34.732 --> 50:36.899
<i>- Have you seen the news?</i>
- Gil, it's been on TV

50:36.901 --> 50:38.968
- all day, man! Of course I seen it!
- <i>Were you there, Johnny?</i>

50:38.970 --> 50:40.268
Hell no!
You know I wasn't there...

50:40.270 --> 50:42.270
<i>You got to clean up your shit.</i>

50:42.272 --> 50:44.006
<i>I can't make this investigation
go away, you know.</i>

50:44.008 --> 50:45.908
<i>Now, you better not have
any AKs laying around, either.</i>

50:45.910 --> 50:47.576
Come on, Gil.
Gil, you know me.

50:47.578 --> 50:49.277
I take care of those
who take care of me. And...

50:49.279 --> 50:51.112
<i>Now, I hear the Feds have
an informant on the street.</i>

50:51.114 --> 50:53.214
<i>Make sure you can trust
everyone around you.</i>

51:11.102 --> 51:14.337
You know how much fucking heat
this gonna bring?

51:14.339 --> 51:17.272
This just ain't no pile of shit
you can kick in the woods.

51:17.274 --> 51:18.940
This is a fucking child.

51:18.942 --> 51:21.009
You know what that mean?

51:21.011 --> 51:23.312
It means somebody black ass
going down for this

51:23.314 --> 51:25.281
whether they did it or not.
They just want a nigga.

51:25.283 --> 51:26.748
Don't matter
if it's the right nigga.

51:26.750 --> 51:28.049
They just want a nigga.

51:28.051 --> 51:29.618
And guess what nigga
it ain't gonna be.

51:29.620 --> 51:32.020
It ain't gonna be me
or any of my goddamn family!

51:32.022 --> 51:34.593
Leon wasn't even
in the motherfucking house!

51:36.861 --> 51:39.261
God damn it!

51:39.263 --> 51:40.632
Shit!

51:44.835 --> 51:46.203
Go.

51:47.238 --> 51:48.973
Go, niggas. Tear your ass!

52:02.787 --> 52:04.786
And don't y'all be
talking to anybody!

52:04.788 --> 52:06.357
You talk, I'll know.

52:24.042 --> 52:26.107
What up, money?
Forget about something?

52:26.109 --> 52:27.843
I ain't forget nothing.

52:27.845 --> 52:29.944
Hey, Ricky.
Something wrong?

52:29.946 --> 52:31.446
Are you fucking kidding me?

52:31.448 --> 52:34.049
We need to talk about
that little boy, Ricky.

52:34.051 --> 52:36.252
What, are you trying to get me
fucking killed?

52:36.254 --> 52:38.788
What's the matter with
you people? I'm done!

52:38.790 --> 52:40.359
Come on, relax.

52:42.426 --> 52:45.062
Fuck it. Let's go.

53:22.366 --> 53:23.969
Here.

53:25.236 --> 53:29.004
- What's this?
- I made you pancakes.

53:29.006 --> 53:31.774
I don't eat pancakes, Ray.

53:31.776 --> 53:33.975
I never ate pancakes.

53:33.977 --> 53:38.147
By the way, you called me
Audrey last night.

53:38.149 --> 53:41.350
You said,
"Good night, Audrey."

53:41.352 --> 53:43.419
I'm not even gonna ask.

53:43.421 --> 53:45.790
I don't know an Audrey.

53:48.158 --> 53:50.993
Ricky, your grandpa
made you pancakes.

53:50.995 --> 53:54.732
I don't like pancakes.
They give me the runs.

54:08.178 --> 54:09.447
Hey, Dad.

54:10.814 --> 54:12.815
Grandpa made some pancakes.

54:12.817 --> 54:15.721
- Thought maybe you'd want some.
- Yeah?

54:16.988 --> 54:18.319
Those all AKs?

54:18.321 --> 54:21.392
Mostly. Got to
get rid of 'em.

54:27.165 --> 54:29.364
Hey, Dad, I'm gonna
do what you said.

54:29.366 --> 54:30.868
I'm gonna go back to school.

54:31.535 --> 54:32.937
Yeah?

54:35.105 --> 54:36.741
Okay.

54:37.975 --> 54:39.341
Oh, listen, by the way,

54:39.343 --> 54:41.410
I made a trade
the other day for a Glock.

54:41.412 --> 54:43.078
Guy threw in a gold dot.

54:43.080 --> 54:45.047
Check him out. He's pretty cool.
Name's Ed.

54:45.049 --> 54:46.051
Ed?

54:58.562 --> 54:59.930
Yo, it's open.

55:02.600 --> 55:04.902
- What up, Nugg?
- What's up, Ricky?

55:06.102 --> 55:08.036
How you doing?

55:08.038 --> 55:10.306
You guys really like
a lot of movies, huh?

55:10.308 --> 55:12.341
Yeah. We're gonna
open up a movie store.

55:12.343 --> 55:13.942
Good.

55:13.944 --> 55:15.277
- You want a soda?
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

55:15.279 --> 55:16.314
I'll take one.

55:18.181 --> 55:21.018
- This your fish?
- My dad's.

55:21.852 --> 55:23.285
What's its name?

55:23.287 --> 55:25.453
- Ed.
- Ed?

55:25.455 --> 55:28.556
- Yeah, Ed.
- It's a nice fish.

55:28.558 --> 55:31.426
- Yeah, I only just met him.
- I'm sorry, dude.

56:03.261 --> 56:05.160
Hey, Frank. Hey.

56:05.162 --> 56:07.328
Where's my goddamn son?
The guys downstairs,

56:07.330 --> 56:08.897
they don't
have him on record.

56:08.899 --> 56:11.065
We have him under a John Doe
for his own protection.

56:11.067 --> 56:12.336
Where the fuck is he?

56:22.580 --> 56:24.913
That's my son?

56:24.915 --> 56:27.015
What the fuck
happened to him?

56:27.017 --> 56:29.150
They say he's gonna make it.

56:29.152 --> 56:32.922
- Who fucking did this?
- We think one of Curry's crew.

56:32.924 --> 56:34.924
I'm gonna kill him.

56:34.926 --> 56:36.292
I'm gonna track him down

56:36.294 --> 56:38.560
and put a bullet through
his scumbag fucking skull.

56:38.562 --> 56:40.995
You got to be careful what
you say in front of us, Rick.

56:40.997 --> 56:42.431
Fuck you, Frank.

56:42.433 --> 56:44.332
You don't think
I got a bullet for you, huh?

56:44.334 --> 56:45.935
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Hey, hey, wait, man.

56:45.937 --> 56:47.335
You, too, you fucking bitch.
And you.

56:47.337 --> 56:48.404
Rick, we're not your enemy.

56:48.406 --> 56:49.939
You're responsible for this.

56:49.941 --> 56:51.973
For the 15-year-old boy
in there.

56:51.975 --> 56:54.710
We've got enough to
bring the Currys in now, Rick.

56:54.712 --> 56:57.011
- Dad? Where's Rick?
- Fuck you.

56:57.013 --> 56:58.980
- Dawn, it's okay now. He's all right.
- Where is he?

56:58.982 --> 57:00.248
I want to see my brother.
I want to see Rick.

57:00.250 --> 57:01.482
- Dawn, hang on.
- I'm going.

57:01.484 --> 57:03.085
- God damn it.
- Get...

57:56.607 --> 57:57.709
Look out, Boo!

57:58.743 --> 58:00.312
Bring Nugg with you.

58:07.451 --> 58:09.150
Damn, where you get

58:09.152 --> 58:11.388
- all that shit from, Johnny?
- You got to know?

58:14.591 --> 58:16.393
Man, they gonna love this.

58:20.131 --> 58:22.167
We'll stay warm
this year, huh?

58:25.803 --> 58:28.370
Lil Man big man now, huh?

58:28.372 --> 58:30.739
- Big man, big man.
- Lil Man big man now.

58:30.741 --> 58:32.473
Big man, big man.

58:47.223 --> 58:49.424
Try 'em on!

58:49.426 --> 58:50.759
Y'all don't know
what to do with 'em.

58:50.761 --> 58:52.393
Y'all don't know what
to do with 'em!

58:52.395 --> 58:53.694
Niggas acting like
they ain't never

58:53.696 --> 58:55.064
seen mink before.

58:55.066 --> 58:56.431
Take your jacket off, man.

58:56.433 --> 58:58.470
You got to take
your jacket off to see.

59:19.089 --> 59:21.656
What you into, Ricky?

59:21.658 --> 59:24.692
They got you listed
under "John Doe."

59:24.694 --> 59:26.597
Who wants you dead so bad?

59:31.468 --> 59:33.570
Least you haven't lost
your looks.

59:34.772 --> 59:37.042
'Cause you never had 'em.

59:40.544 --> 59:43.178
It was good, wasn't it?

59:43.180 --> 59:46.250
When we were kids?
For a little while?

59:50.386 --> 59:52.623
You still are a kid, Rick.

01:00:14.511 --> 01:00:16.814
Hey, Ricky.
How you feeling?

01:00:17.881 --> 01:00:20.181
Brought you a present.

01:00:20.183 --> 01:00:22.754
You might not like
the music, though.

01:00:30.828 --> 01:00:32.730
Who did this to you, Ricky?

01:00:36.167 --> 01:00:38.366
Was it Steve?

01:00:38.368 --> 01:00:39.835
Nugg?

01:00:39.837 --> 01:00:41.469
Was it Boo?

01:00:41.471 --> 01:00:43.437
Boo would've never done this.

01:00:43.439 --> 01:00:44.906
Okay.

01:00:44.908 --> 01:00:47.408
It doesn't really matter
who pulled the trigger,

01:00:47.410 --> 01:00:49.877
because we both know who put
the gun in their hands.

01:00:49.879 --> 01:00:52.681
Johnny knows
we have an informant.

01:00:52.683 --> 01:00:55.417
But it's all worked out
for the best, Ricky.

01:00:55.419 --> 01:00:57.752
We raided one of the houses
you were buying from.

01:00:57.754 --> 01:01:00.888
His crew flipped on him
and sold him out.

01:01:02.225 --> 01:01:04.593
FBI! FBI!

01:01:04.595 --> 01:01:05.861
- Move, move, move!
- Who is that?

01:01:05.863 --> 01:01:07.828
Bedroom, bedroom,
bedroom, bedroom!

01:01:07.830 --> 01:01:10.299
- Johnny!
- Go, go, go, go!

01:01:10.301 --> 01:01:11.632
Back up, back up! Put it down!

01:01:11.634 --> 01:01:13.301
Get down, get down!

01:01:13.303 --> 01:01:15.469
- Get down, get down!
- Get the fuck down,

01:01:15.471 --> 01:01:18.806
or I will fucking put
a bullet in your brain!

01:01:18.808 --> 01:01:21.446
The fuck
off me, man! Shit!

01:01:25.348 --> 01:01:27.582
- Johnny!
- Let's go.

01:01:27.584 --> 01:01:28.685
Freeze!

01:01:29.953 --> 01:01:31.256
Hey!

01:01:36.826 --> 01:01:38.759
- Get off me!
- Hands behind your back.

01:01:38.761 --> 01:01:39.895
Moving out.

01:01:39.897 --> 01:01:41.964
- Chill. I'm going, man.
- Shut up!

01:01:41.966 --> 01:01:43.931
- Are you serious?
- Up on your feet!

01:01:43.933 --> 01:01:45.734
- Come on!
- Let him go!

01:01:45.736 --> 01:01:48.236
- Let's go.
- Take your hands off my little brother!

01:01:48.238 --> 01:01:50.272
He got nothing to do
with nothing!

01:01:50.274 --> 01:01:51.906
Take your hands off him!

01:01:51.908 --> 01:01:55.444
Yeah, your brother can't
help your ass now, huh?

01:01:55.446 --> 01:01:58.580
<i>What happened to you
could just complicate things.</i>

01:01:58.582 --> 01:02:00.716
It's better
if this never happened.

01:02:00.718 --> 01:02:02.750
You understand
what I'm saying?

01:02:02.752 --> 01:02:04.886
Just like it's better
if we forget about

01:02:04.888 --> 01:02:07.692
that little hobby of your
dad's down in the basement.

01:02:21.004 --> 01:02:22.603
Here we go, champ.

01:02:22.605 --> 01:02:24.506
Got to be exciting knowing

01:02:24.508 --> 01:02:26.607
you're gonna be sleeping
in your own bed.

01:02:26.609 --> 01:02:28.844
- Yeah.
- Is Dawn here?

01:02:28.846 --> 01:02:30.312
No.

01:02:30.314 --> 01:02:32.980
Apparently,
Ty flew the coop.

01:02:32.982 --> 01:02:35.783
Good riddance, I say.
But you know women.

01:02:35.785 --> 01:02:37.986
Anyway, we don't,
we don't need her negativity

01:02:37.988 --> 01:02:39.489
around here right now.

01:02:41.457 --> 01:02:44.558
Grandma.

01:02:44.560 --> 01:02:47.696
You just ever
think about moving?

01:02:47.698 --> 01:02:51.366
It's been so long since
anything good has happened.

01:02:51.368 --> 01:02:53.902
Look, Rick, things are
gonna be looking up, you know?

01:02:53.904 --> 01:02:55.837
First off, we're gonna
get you healthy.

01:02:55.839 --> 01:02:58.473
Look at that.
Nice stuff. Come on up.

01:02:58.475 --> 01:03:00.475
You got it?
One step at a time.

01:03:00.477 --> 01:03:04.312
Here we go, here we go.
All right, now.

01:03:04.314 --> 01:03:06.915
You're not even gonna recognize
what's behind this door.

01:03:06.917 --> 01:03:09.417
I got this place
so fucking spick-and-span.

01:03:09.419 --> 01:03:11.786
Hang on.

01:03:11.788 --> 01:03:13.357
Here we go.

01:03:14.558 --> 01:03:15.924
Home sweet home.

01:03:15.926 --> 01:03:17.595
Look at that.

01:03:30.774 --> 01:03:33.040
Hey, champ,
you need a hand there?

01:03:33.042 --> 01:03:35.576
How am I supposed to go
to school like this?

01:03:35.578 --> 01:03:37.011
Ah, well, the thing is...

01:03:37.013 --> 01:03:38.814
And I've been meaning
to tell you...

01:03:38.816 --> 01:03:40.781
They're not gonna
let you go to school.

01:03:40.783 --> 01:03:42.850
Because you got shot.

01:03:42.852 --> 01:03:44.955
They think you're a risk
to the other kids.

01:03:46.489 --> 01:03:48.056
Listen, there's
spares under the sink,

01:03:48.058 --> 01:03:49.957
but what do you say we rinse
that one out? They're, like,

01:03:49.959 --> 01:03:51.960
- three bucks a bag.
- I'm not rinsing this fucking out.

01:03:51.962 --> 01:03:53.462
If you want to save money,
you rinse it out.

01:03:53.464 --> 01:03:54.962
Okay, okay.

01:03:54.964 --> 01:03:56.531
Just asking.

01:03:56.533 --> 01:03:58.734
You know, maybe we'll buy
in bulk next time.

01:03:58.736 --> 01:04:00.569
Bound to be cheaper.

01:04:00.571 --> 01:04:03.437
Here, give me that.
I'll take it for a wash.

01:04:03.439 --> 01:04:06.674
All right?
Whatever you need, champ.

01:04:06.676 --> 01:04:08.345
Whatever you need.

01:04:09.980 --> 01:04:11.413
Hey, Ricky.

01:04:11.415 --> 01:04:13.547
You know, there's a gun show
in a few weeks.

01:04:13.549 --> 01:04:15.049
Maybe you and I
take a road trip,

01:04:15.051 --> 01:04:17.521
- if you're feeling up for it.
- Sounds great.

01:04:29.600 --> 01:04:31.165
<i>The driver was shot in the arm</i>

01:04:31.167 --> 01:04:33.033
<i>during the holdup
and taken to the hospital.</i>

01:04:34.437 --> 01:04:35.603
<i>Police say the gunfire
was staged.</i>

01:04:35.605 --> 01:04:36.640
<i>If found guilty...</i>

01:04:37.707 --> 01:04:39.607
<i>...years in the penitentiary.</i>

01:04:45.982 --> 01:04:47.616
You gonna get yourself shot,

01:04:47.618 --> 01:04:49.850
knocking on a stranger's door
like that, kid.

01:04:49.852 --> 01:04:51.420
You're Ricky Wershe, right?

01:04:51.422 --> 01:04:53.754
- Yeah.
- You've made a baby with my sister.

01:04:53.756 --> 01:04:55.957
- Who?
- Brenda Moore.

01:04:55.959 --> 01:04:58.058
You need to call her
and be a man about it.

01:04:58.060 --> 01:05:00.529
Look, I only been with Brenda,
like, a couple times.

01:05:00.531 --> 01:05:02.129
Only take one time
to make a baby.

01:05:02.131 --> 01:05:04.565
Besides, Keisha damn near
as white as you is.

01:05:04.567 --> 01:05:06.000
Who the fuck Keisha?

01:05:06.002 --> 01:05:08.103
- My niece, your daughter.
- Ricky!

01:05:08.105 --> 01:05:12.174
Shut the fucking door, will you?
Letting all the heat out.

01:05:12.176 --> 01:05:14.542
- Who the hell are you?
- You his daddy?

01:05:14.544 --> 01:05:17.545
- That's right.
- Well, now you a granddaddy.

01:05:17.547 --> 01:05:20.781
Be a man, call my sister.
If you don't, I'll be back.

01:05:20.783 --> 01:05:22.486
And you don't want me
coming back.

01:05:27.191 --> 01:05:28.824
What's he talking about, Rick?

01:05:28.826 --> 01:05:31.963
I don't know.
I chilled with his sister.

01:05:33.497 --> 01:05:34.799
And you didn't wear nothing?

01:05:35.998 --> 01:05:38.069
Ah, fuck, Rick.

01:05:51.547 --> 01:05:53.183
Brenda,
your baby daddy here.

01:05:57.754 --> 01:05:59.855
What's Grandpa doing
sitting out there?

01:05:59.857 --> 01:06:00.925
He drove me.

01:06:06.230 --> 01:06:09.000
- Ricky Wershe.
- Hey, Brenda Moore.

01:06:12.803 --> 01:06:14.538
Oh, Christ.

01:06:16.573 --> 01:06:18.540
What?

01:06:18.542 --> 01:06:21.612
- What's up, Grandpa?
- "What's up, Grandpa?"

01:06:24.614 --> 01:06:26.181
She's so tiny.

01:06:26.183 --> 01:06:28.549
She supposed to be that tiny?

01:06:28.551 --> 01:06:30.785
She only a month and a half.

01:06:30.787 --> 01:06:33.955
She's pretty, just like you.

01:06:33.957 --> 01:06:35.926
Be bad news
if she looked like me.

01:06:37.727 --> 01:06:39.761
I didn't mean that
how it sound.

01:06:39.763 --> 01:06:43.201
She yours, Ricky.
I'm not playing you.

01:06:45.301 --> 01:06:47.104
I mean,
I'm happy she yours.

01:06:55.946 --> 01:06:58.045
Just make sure you
support her head, okay?

01:07:37.955 --> 01:07:39.824
Acting different
around Daddy.

01:07:44.093 --> 01:07:45.095
This is your daddy.

01:07:49.031 --> 01:07:51.001
Ain't no way
that's my son's baby.

01:07:55.038 --> 01:07:57.275
She's way too beautiful.

01:07:59.709 --> 01:08:02.844
Here, son, let me hold her.
Let me show you how it's done.

01:08:02.846 --> 01:08:04.145
Come here, you. Come here.

01:08:04.147 --> 01:08:06.982
There you are. Yeah.

01:08:06.984 --> 01:08:08.382
I used to do this little dance

01:08:08.384 --> 01:08:10.685
with your daddy
and his sister, yeah.

01:08:12.221 --> 01:08:14.888
Yes, ma'am.
It's all brand-new, isn't it?

01:08:14.890 --> 01:08:16.126
You like to dance?

01:08:17.294 --> 01:08:19.194
Yes, ma'am.

01:08:30.106 --> 01:08:31.840
<i>Here, straight talk?</i>

01:08:31.841 --> 01:08:35.710
Your mother and I, we...
We didn't plan on having Dawn.

01:08:35.712 --> 01:08:38.647
I mean, to be honest, we didn't
plan on having you, either.

01:08:38.649 --> 01:08:41.416
But in the end,
things worked out.

01:08:41.417 --> 01:08:45.819
Dad, your daughter is a junkie,
and I'm shitting into a bag.

01:08:45.821 --> 01:08:47.688
Well, what can I say,
you know?

01:08:47.689 --> 01:08:49.626
Glass-half-full kind of guy.

01:09:10.881 --> 01:09:14.051
You're gonna be a great dad.
I know you are.

01:09:15.451 --> 01:09:17.786
You know, I was thinking,
as soon as we get

01:09:17.787 --> 01:09:19.386
this video store
up and running,

01:09:19.388 --> 01:09:22.359
first thing I want to buy
is a new set of wheels.

01:09:27.897 --> 01:09:30.863
I know things haven't
proceeded as anticipated,

01:09:30.866 --> 01:09:33.801
but a good idea, Rick,
is like a fine wine.

01:09:33.803 --> 01:09:35.737
It gets better with time.

01:09:35.738 --> 01:09:37.774
Things aren't gonna
get better, Dad.

01:09:40.944 --> 01:09:43.478
You happy with this?

01:09:43.479 --> 01:09:45.249
You happy with who you are?

01:09:47.950 --> 01:09:50.184
Don't be thinking
what the right answer is.

01:09:50.185 --> 01:09:51.854
There's only one right answer.

01:09:54.024 --> 01:09:55.926
You know how
we can change this.

01:10:02.432 --> 01:10:04.331
No.

01:10:04.333 --> 01:10:06.266
No drugs, God damn it.

01:10:06.268 --> 01:10:08.135
No drugs.

01:10:08.137 --> 01:10:10.104
They're poison, Ricky.

01:10:10.106 --> 01:10:11.872
They kill people.
No fucking way.

01:10:11.874 --> 01:10:14.408
What the fuck do you think
you're selling? Water pistols?

01:10:14.410 --> 01:10:16.478
Ricky, guns are
a constitutional right.

01:10:16.480 --> 01:10:19.380
There's nothing in
the Constitution about drugs.

01:10:19.382 --> 01:10:20.881
The fuck are you
talking about?

01:10:20.883 --> 01:10:22.349
I'm talking about
the goddamn Constitution,

01:10:22.351 --> 01:10:23.885
what this fucking country
was founded on, Ricky.

01:10:23.887 --> 01:10:24.952
Dad!

01:10:24.954 --> 01:10:25.890
Fuck!

01:10:36.999 --> 01:10:40.171
- Uh... You okay?
- Yeah.

01:10:48.912 --> 01:10:50.114
Oh, shit.

01:10:57.454 --> 01:11:00.822
Look at this shit.
Look how we're living.

01:11:00.824 --> 01:11:02.956
We got to do
something, Dad.

01:11:02.958 --> 01:11:05.260
We got to make some money.

01:11:05.262 --> 01:11:08.129
No. No drugs, Ricky.

01:11:08.131 --> 01:11:09.930
- You know I can't do that.
- Fuck, Dad.

01:11:09.932 --> 01:11:12.367
You been selling to the drug
dealers every damn day.

01:11:12.369 --> 01:11:16.237
The only difference is you been
making pennies on the dollar.

01:11:16.239 --> 01:11:19.273
You know, about time we go grab
the dollar, don't you think?

01:11:19.275 --> 01:11:21.275
Hey, come on, Dad.

01:11:21.277 --> 01:11:23.978
I can do this.

01:11:23.980 --> 01:11:25.750
We can do this.

01:11:27.383 --> 01:11:29.516
I mean, I know the players.

01:11:29.518 --> 01:11:32.120
And I know their game.

01:11:32.122 --> 01:11:34.488
Ah, Ricky,
I already lost Dawn.

01:11:34.490 --> 01:11:36.957
I can't lose you, too.

01:11:36.959 --> 01:11:38.893
Dad, we didn't lose Dawn.

01:11:38.895 --> 01:11:40.528
There's just no way she's
coming home the way things are.

01:11:40.530 --> 01:11:43.264
There's just nothing
to come home to.

01:11:43.266 --> 01:11:45.399
Like, ain't nobody
gonna help us.

01:11:45.401 --> 01:11:48.172
We got to do this
before it's too late.

01:11:54.311 --> 01:11:56.514
I've got a daughter, too, now.

01:12:07.524 --> 01:12:08.926
What up, Art?

01:12:10.060 --> 01:12:11.195
Hey, kid.

01:12:12.494 --> 01:12:14.328
What the fuck?

01:12:14.330 --> 01:12:16.199
You told me
to look you up sometime.

01:12:18.101 --> 01:12:19.804
Come in.

01:12:33.949 --> 01:12:36.350
- What's up, bro?
- Give me an eight, man.

01:12:36.352 --> 01:12:37.421
Two.

01:13:41.083 --> 01:13:42.250
Hey, Dawn.

01:13:42.252 --> 01:13:44.288
It's me. Ricky.

01:13:46.155 --> 01:13:48.555
- Ricky?
- Yeah.

01:13:48.557 --> 01:13:51.125
I brought Dad, too.

01:13:51.127 --> 01:13:53.126
We're gonna take you home.

01:13:53.128 --> 01:13:54.629
Why he here?

01:13:54.631 --> 01:13:57.665
I fucking...
Fucking hate him, Ricky.

01:13:57.667 --> 01:14:00.033
You know how much
I hate him.

01:14:00.035 --> 01:14:02.103
We're gonna take you home.

01:14:02.105 --> 01:14:04.372
Nah, I don't want
to go home.

01:14:04.374 --> 01:14:05.706
This my home.

01:14:05.708 --> 01:14:09.344
No, Dawn. You need to
come with us, okay?

01:14:09.346 --> 01:14:11.045
You need to come with us now.

01:14:11.047 --> 01:14:13.715
I got all my stuff here.

01:14:13.717 --> 01:14:16.320
I can't leave my stuff.

01:14:21.156 --> 01:14:22.357
It's all shit, Dawn.

01:14:22.359 --> 01:14:24.024
We'll get you new stuff.

01:14:24.026 --> 01:14:26.426
You'll get me new stuff?

01:14:26.428 --> 01:14:28.097
Whatever you want.

01:14:29.231 --> 01:14:30.667

01:14:32.768 --> 01:14:35.039
I promise.

01:14:41.477 --> 01:14:45.046
- No. No, no, no, no, no, no.
- Come on.

01:14:45.048 --> 01:14:46.447
No, no, no, no, no, no!

01:14:46.449 --> 01:14:48.181
No, no! Don't touch me!

01:14:48.183 --> 01:14:49.449

01:24:36.939 --> 01:24:39.939
Seeing you and Dawn
tonight, Ma and Pa,

01:24:39.941 --> 01:24:42.009
hell, I'm damn near perfect.

01:24:42.011 --> 01:24:43.780
It's just that, uh...

01:24:45.047 --> 01:24:46.279
Just what?

01:24:46.281 --> 01:24:48.681
Well, it's fragile.

01:24:48.683 --> 01:24:51.684
This thing. Family.

01:24:51.686 --> 01:24:53.957
And I don't want it
to come apart, you know?

01:24:55.690 --> 01:24:59.093
I don't want
to break it, again.

01:24:59.095 --> 01:25:01.629
Well, why don't you go in,
and I'll wait for her.

01:25:01.631 --> 01:25:03.799
Eh, she's my watch to keep.

01:25:04.900 --> 01:25:06.166
Same as you.

01:25:06.168 --> 01:25:08.135
I can watch
my own ass, Dad.

01:25:08.137 --> 01:25:09.139
Mmm-hmm.

01:25:11.140 --> 01:25:13.306
Let's not break this, Ricky.

01:25:13.308 --> 01:25:15.009
Let's not get greedy.

01:25:15.011 --> 01:25:17.814
We don't need much more than
we already have right now.

01:25:21.917 --> 01:25:24.654
Yeah. All right, Pops.

01:25:25.655 --> 01:25:27.187
Goddamn.

01:25:27.189 --> 01:25:28.988
Your ass smells
like a whorehouse

01:25:28.990 --> 01:25:31.157
- on New Year's morning.
- For real?

01:25:31.159 --> 01:25:32.826
Yeah, for real.

01:25:32.828 --> 01:25:35.328
Good night, Dad.

01:25:35.330 --> 01:25:36.932
Good night, son.

01:26:16.905 --> 01:26:18.337
The fuck are you doing?

01:26:18.339 --> 01:26:20.873
- I'm shaving.
- Since when do you shave?

01:26:20.875 --> 01:26:22.943
- Since now.
- You ain't got no hair!

01:26:22.945 --> 01:26:25.882
- Oh, yeah?
- No, not the face! That's gonna hurt!

01:26:28.116 --> 01:26:31.117
- Drop the gun!
- Hey! Quiet down, Rick!

01:26:31.119 --> 01:26:33.120
- Quiet down, Rick!
- Get on the ground!

01:26:33.122 --> 01:26:35.322
Get down! You get down
on the goddamn ground!

01:26:35.324 --> 01:26:36.956
Stop resisting! Get down!

01:26:36.958 --> 01:26:39.492
Up against the fucking wall!
Back up! Back the fuck up!

01:26:39.494 --> 01:26:41.995
- Don't move!
- Ricky, what the fuck is going on?

01:26:41.997 --> 01:26:44.732
Hey, don't fucking touch her!
Don't fucking touch her!

01:26:44.734 --> 01:26:45.866
Enough!

01:26:45.868 --> 01:26:47.400
- Get him up.
- Hold on. Let go!

01:26:47.402 --> 01:26:49.470
- Come on. Fuck!
- Ricky! Ricky!

01:26:49.472 --> 01:26:52.171
The fuck you think, Rick, huh? You
think you wasn't gonna get caught?

01:26:52.173 --> 01:26:54.273
I don't know what the fuck
you talking about!

01:26:54.275 --> 01:26:55.509
You don't know what the fuck
I'm talking about?

01:26:55.511 --> 01:26:57.277
Fucker, look at me.
Eight kilos.

01:26:57.279 --> 01:26:59.179
- Keep your fucking hands off of him!
- Eight kilos.

01:26:59.181 --> 01:27:00.980
- Rick!
- You think I'm fucking stupid?

01:27:00.982 --> 01:27:02.148
No, boy, I think you're
fucked, that's what I think!

01:27:02.150 --> 01:27:03.317
Get off of him!

01:27:06.254 --> 01:27:08.221
- Rick!
- Ain't no burgers

01:27:08.223 --> 01:27:09.926
and fries back there,
huh, bitch?

01:27:15.498 --> 01:27:17.167
The fuck is going on?

01:27:29.979 --> 01:27:32.211
This is what
we're up against, gentlemen.

01:27:32.213 --> 01:27:34.947
Okay, I mean, they're making
him out like he's Capone.

01:27:34.949 --> 01:27:36.884
That's the sentiment
in the city.

01:27:36.886 --> 01:27:39.452
The mayor himself has warned
me to stay clear of this.

01:27:39.454 --> 01:27:41.321
Ricky's a leper.

01:27:41.323 --> 01:27:43.823
Look, Bill, it's not like
he killed anyone.

01:27:43.825 --> 01:27:46.393
650 grams, Rick.
That's the law.

01:27:46.395 --> 01:27:48.929
You know how much was
in that box? Eight kilos.

01:27:48.931 --> 01:27:51.264
That's 8,000 grams.
It would be better for Ricky

01:27:51.266 --> 01:27:53.399
- if he had killed someone.
- Where are the Feds

01:27:53.401 --> 01:27:55.001
and the cops on this, right?
They're the ones

01:27:55.003 --> 01:27:56.403
that got him dealing
in the first place.

01:27:56.405 --> 01:27:58.538
- Where the fuck are they?
- Ask yourself this.

01:27:58.540 --> 01:28:00.340
Would you believe
a 15-year-old kid

01:28:00.342 --> 01:28:02.746
was working for
the federal government?

01:28:05.481 --> 01:28:07.250
But he was.

01:28:16.958 --> 01:28:18.891
Listen, Ricky, this...

01:28:18.893 --> 01:28:21.894
This might be our only chance
of cutting a deal.

01:28:21.896 --> 01:28:24.167
So let me do the talking.

01:28:25.167 --> 01:28:26.102
Okay.

01:28:28.070 --> 01:28:30.170
<i>It's not a conspiracy, Rick.</i>

01:28:30.172 --> 01:28:32.406
We just can't say
anything publicly.

01:28:32.408 --> 01:28:34.574
Yeah, but I can.
I go to the press, tell them

01:28:34.576 --> 01:28:36.510
the Feds turned my son
into a drug dealer,

01:28:36.512 --> 01:28:38.178
that's headlines
from now till Sunday.

01:28:38.180 --> 01:28:39.846
That's not a smart move.

01:28:39.848 --> 01:28:41.380
Ricky's in a tough spot.
I appreciate that.

01:28:41.382 --> 01:28:44.050
But we're not here
to negotiate.

01:28:44.052 --> 01:28:45.885
We don't have
a lot of power here.

01:28:45.887 --> 01:28:47.621
This is not a federal case.

01:28:47.623 --> 01:28:51.123
And the Bureau rejects
any narrative that suggests

01:28:51.125 --> 01:28:53.128
we encouraged Ricky
to sell drugs.

01:28:54.396 --> 01:28:56.596
He did that on his own,
and he got caught.

01:28:56.598 --> 01:28:59.465
And now he's facing
a life sentence.

01:28:59.467 --> 01:29:02.336
We want to offer Ricky
an opportunity,

01:29:02.338 --> 01:29:04.203
maybe a way out.

01:29:04.205 --> 01:29:05.941
What's he got to do?

01:29:08.110 --> 01:29:10.644
We'd like to get an agent
on the inside.

01:29:10.646 --> 01:29:14.150
If you can do that,
we can get some convictions...

01:29:15.516 --> 01:29:17.251
Maybe we can
return the favor.

01:29:17.253 --> 01:29:19.586
Those people
ain't gonna talk to me.

01:29:19.588 --> 01:29:22.255
There is someone
you could talk to.

01:29:22.257 --> 01:29:25.992
Her father's close to Gil Hill,
not to mention the mayor.

01:29:25.994 --> 01:29:29.296
Cathy? Cathy's in a bad way.

01:29:29.298 --> 01:29:32.366
- She don't got nobody.
- Look, Rick, just talk to her.

01:29:32.368 --> 01:29:35.402
Let her know that your Miami
connect is coming into town,

01:29:35.404 --> 01:29:38.205
needs protection
for a large shipment.

01:29:38.207 --> 01:29:39.572
You get her to meet him,

01:29:39.574 --> 01:29:41.974
get the introduction
to the father,

01:29:41.976 --> 01:29:43.510
and we'll take it from there.

01:29:43.512 --> 01:29:46.078
You guys are going after
Young, aren't you?

01:29:46.080 --> 01:29:48.114
You're going after the mayor.

01:29:48.116 --> 01:29:50.583
We have no intention
of charging Cathy.

01:29:50.585 --> 01:29:53.586
- She's not our target.
- Just like Boo wasn't?

01:29:53.588 --> 01:29:55.522
Boo ain't do shit,
and y'all still got

01:29:55.524 --> 01:29:57.189
his ass locked up.

01:29:57.191 --> 01:29:59.192
Ricky,
give this a chance, all right?

01:29:59.194 --> 01:30:01.394
Listen up. Now, I understand you
got feelings for this girl.

01:30:01.396 --> 01:30:03.630
But this is about getting guys
like Jackson, all right?

01:30:03.632 --> 01:30:07.233
He's half the reason
we're here in the first place.

01:30:07.235 --> 01:30:10.073
I think it's worth
a shot, Rick.

01:30:11.240 --> 01:30:13.176
What do you think, champ?

01:30:17.680 --> 01:30:20.083
I'll do whatever
you say, Dad.

01:30:28.423 --> 01:30:30.357
Okay.

01:30:30.359 --> 01:30:32.725
We're gonna need something
in writing, all right?

01:30:32.727 --> 01:30:34.396
Some kind of contract.

01:30:35.564 --> 01:30:37.697
I'm sorry,
we can't do that, Rick.

01:30:37.699 --> 01:30:40.634
I mean, if we have anything
on paper, it's gonna look like

01:30:40.636 --> 01:30:43.703
Ricky's just saying whatever he
needs to, to stay out of jail.

01:30:45.140 --> 01:30:46.676
So what the fuck
are you saying?

01:30:51.646 --> 01:30:53.917
I'm saying
you have to trust us.

01:31:13.002 --> 01:31:14.667
What you doing here, Rick?

01:31:14.669 --> 01:31:16.403
You know
I can't be seen with you.

01:31:16.405 --> 01:31:18.705
- I just need a minute, Cath.
- I can't, Rick.

01:31:18.707 --> 01:31:21.977
There's a big shipment,
and I need help, Cath.

01:31:24.445 --> 01:31:26.747
<i>Major news tonight as the FBI</i>

01:31:26.749 --> 01:31:28.748
- <i>makes a public corruption case...</i>
- You bastards.

01:31:28.750 --> 01:31:31.050
- <i>...in the city of Detroit.</i>
- Serves 'em right.

01:31:31.052 --> 01:31:33.754
<i>Eleven police officers,
including Jimmy Harris,</i>

01:31:33.756 --> 01:31:36.555
<i>were brought into the federal
courthouse in handcuffs.</i>

01:31:36.557 --> 01:31:39.326
<i>Six civilians
were also arrested,</i>

01:31:39.328 --> 01:31:42.028
<i>including the mayor's
brother-in-law, Willie Volsan.</i>

01:31:42.030 --> 01:31:43.529
<i>Several law
enforcement sources</i>

01:31:43.531 --> 01:31:45.765
<i>tell us that it was
Rick Wershe Jr.,</i>

01:31:45.767 --> 01:31:50.202
<i>aka White Boy Rick, who vouched
for an undercover agent posing</i>

01:31:50.204 --> 01:31:52.505
<i>as a drug dealer
who wanted to hire cops</i>

01:31:52.507 --> 01:31:54.140
<i>to protect his shipments.</i>

01:31:54.142 --> 01:31:56.609
<i>Sources also tell us
Wershe provided information</i>

01:31:56.611 --> 01:31:58.745
<i>about homicide inspector
Gil Hill</i>

01:31:58.747 --> 01:32:01.148
<i>and bribes paid to cover up
an unrelated shooting.</i>

01:32:01.150 --> 01:32:03.215
- What is this?
- Nah, it's okay, Pop.

01:32:03.217 --> 01:32:05.719
Me and Ricky,
we got it all worked out.

01:32:05.721 --> 01:32:07.687
The Feds got it fixed up
with the judge.

01:32:07.689 --> 01:32:09.822
We're all good.
We're all good.

01:32:09.824 --> 01:32:12.658
<i>Wershe, who has
clearly made powerful enemies,</i>

01:32:12.660 --> 01:32:14.493
<i>now faces a life sentence</i>

01:32:14.495 --> 01:32:17.132
<i>if convicted
of the cocaine charges.</i>

01:32:24.306 --> 01:32:26.339
The court
will come to order.

01:32:26.341 --> 01:32:29.443
That's
what that is right there.

01:32:29.445 --> 01:32:32.345
Has the jury
reached a verdict?

01:32:32.347 --> 01:32:33.747
Yes, we have, Your Honor.

01:32:33.749 --> 01:32:35.581
Please hand it
to my bailiff.

01:32:35.583 --> 01:32:37.083
...lets the judge know that

01:32:37.085 --> 01:32:39.454
we got a deal
for helping out.

01:32:46.395 --> 01:32:48.263
Will the defendant
please rise?

01:32:54.470 --> 01:32:56.336
The People
of the State of Michigan

01:32:56.338 --> 01:32:59.139
find the defendant,
Richard Wershe Jr.,

01:32:59.141 --> 01:33:02.408
guilty of possession
with the intent to distribute

01:33:02.410 --> 01:33:05.679
greater than 650 grams
of a controlled substance,

01:33:05.681 --> 01:33:07.346
which, in the state
of Michigan,

01:33:07.348 --> 01:33:10.317
carries a mandatory
sentence of life

01:33:10.319 --> 01:33:13.319
without the possibility of parole.

01:33:13.321 --> 01:33:15.788
- Rick!
- What is wrong with you people?

01:33:15.790 --> 01:33:17.491
- This boy is 17 years old!
- Juror number one,

01:33:17.493 --> 01:33:19.492
- how do you find?
- Guilty.

01:33:19.494 --> 01:33:21.827
- Ricky!
- Juror number two...

01:33:21.829 --> 01:33:24.130
We're getting
to the bottom of this.

01:33:24.132 --> 01:33:25.564
We're getting to
the bottom of this.

01:33:25.566 --> 01:33:27.166
- Order in the court!
- Ricky? Ricky! Ricky!

01:33:27.168 --> 01:33:28.602
- Rick, baby!
- Stay strong!

01:33:28.604 --> 01:33:31.106
You know what you just did?
You took a life.

01:34:21.356 --> 01:34:23.493
<i>Okay, now,
give me three good squats.</i>

01:34:24.226 --> 01:34:25.425
Two.

01:34:25.427 --> 01:34:27.426
All the way down. Deeper.

01:34:27.428 --> 01:34:28.864
Hold it, hold it.

01:34:30.464 --> 01:34:33.433
Keep your cup and your spoon
with you at all times.

01:34:33.435 --> 01:34:35.268
Come on, this way.

01:34:37.606 --> 01:34:39.872
You'll be allowed
out in the yard by yourself

01:34:39.874 --> 01:34:41.875
one hour each day.

01:34:41.877 --> 01:34:44.211
The remaining 23 hours, you're
gonna be secured in your cell.

01:34:44.213 --> 01:34:45.578
That's for
your own protection.

01:34:45.580 --> 01:34:46.845
There'll be
no communicating

01:34:46.847 --> 01:34:48.415
while you're confined
in your cell.

01:34:48.417 --> 01:34:50.216
If you feel the need
to communicate,

01:34:50.218 --> 01:34:52.885
fill out an inmate request
form, drop it in the box.

01:34:52.887 --> 01:34:54.555
You have any questions?

01:35:03.765 --> 01:35:07.333
Hey. Hey.
I need to talk to you, Alex.

01:35:07.335 --> 01:35:08.867
- Hey, Rick.
- Yeah?

01:35:08.869 --> 01:35:10.903
Listen, I got to be someplace,
but come by the office

01:35:10.905 --> 01:35:12.805
- next week, we'll talk.
- No, no, I came by the office

01:35:12.807 --> 01:35:15.442
- three times this week.
- Yeah. I know.

01:35:15.444 --> 01:35:17.410
Well, what the fuck
happened, Alex?

01:35:17.412 --> 01:35:19.746
What do you want me to say? I
mean, is anything I say gonna

01:35:19.748 --> 01:35:21.680
- make you feel any better?
- No, Ricky did his bit.

01:35:21.682 --> 01:35:24.550
- It's time for you to do yours.
- Okay. We're in a public place,

01:35:24.552 --> 01:35:26.885
so I'm gonna need to ask you
to keep your voice down.

01:35:26.887 --> 01:35:28.555
Okay,
what the fuck happened?

01:35:28.557 --> 01:35:30.357
Okay, let's be clear.
You were promised nothing.

01:35:30.359 --> 01:35:33.326
You were told that the Bureau
would make best efforts

01:35:33.328 --> 01:35:35.028
with the court
to mitigate Ricky's sentence.

01:35:35.030 --> 01:35:37.964
We did that,
the judge was not responsive.

01:35:37.966 --> 01:35:40.266
"The judge was not responsive"?
What the fuck is that?

01:35:40.268 --> 01:35:41.934
That's what you're calling
your best fucking effort?

01:35:41.936 --> 01:35:43.636
That's your answer?

01:35:43.638 --> 01:35:45.305
- No, you told me to trust you.
- I get that.

01:35:45.307 --> 01:35:46.805
You told me to trust you.
You didn't do shit.

01:35:46.807 --> 01:35:48.474
- I have to go. Okay.
- You sold us out.

01:35:48.476 --> 01:35:50.312
- I'm leaving now.
- You sold us fucking out!

01:36:12.967 --> 01:36:15.769
I really prefer
to drink alone, Rick.

01:36:15.771 --> 01:36:17.504
It's okay, Frank.

01:36:17.506 --> 01:36:19.839
We're just a couple of guys
on a day off, right?

01:36:19.841 --> 01:36:21.343
It's not my day off.

01:36:23.744 --> 01:36:25.814
Why's this happen
to my son?

01:36:26.815 --> 01:36:28.681
Just tell me the truth.

01:36:28.683 --> 01:36:31.417
- Why him?
- Well, you deal in narcotics,

01:36:31.419 --> 01:36:33.452
- you get busted.
- It's not true, Frank.

01:36:33.454 --> 01:36:36.355
- God damn it, we had a deal.
- You know...

01:36:36.357 --> 01:36:38.692
I can't really square
that circle for you, Rick.

01:36:38.694 --> 01:36:42.495
Your boy was out. And he
decided to get back in.

01:36:42.497 --> 01:36:46.032
And you were not exactly
an innocent bystander.

01:36:52.507 --> 01:36:54.573
You know,
it's not about Ricky.

01:36:54.575 --> 01:36:56.108
It's not about
his little friends.

01:36:56.110 --> 01:36:59.047
It's not about kids selling
dime bags on the corner.

01:37:00.615 --> 01:37:01.980
We throw
the little ones back,

01:37:01.982 --> 01:37:05.452
but when the big fish
gets away,

01:37:05.454 --> 01:37:08.721
they got to take
what's left in the net.

01:37:08.723 --> 01:37:11.523
So 'cause you don't get
the fucking mayor,

01:37:11.525 --> 01:37:14.062
my kid goes down.

01:37:17.132 --> 01:37:18.933
He's young.

01:37:21.369 --> 01:37:22.704
He'll get out.

01:37:33.013 --> 01:37:36.849
Come on, high five.

01:37:43.658 --> 01:37:44.927
Look, sweetie.

01:37:46.561 --> 01:37:48.795
Look. It's your daddy.

01:37:48.797 --> 01:37:50.729
Remember? From the picture?

01:37:50.731 --> 01:37:53.832
The one we kiss each night
with Mommy?

01:37:53.834 --> 01:37:55.801
Hi, Daddy.

01:37:55.803 --> 01:37:58.604
Grandma misses you.

01:37:58.606 --> 01:38:00.739
Hey, she'd have came,
but, uh...

01:38:00.741 --> 01:38:03.742
Grandpa Ray's
still not better.

01:38:03.744 --> 01:38:06.715
We don't know if he's
gonna get better, so...

01:38:08.949 --> 01:38:10.852
How you doing, Dawn?

01:38:12.087 --> 01:38:14.022
I hate that you're
in here, Ricky.

01:38:15.190 --> 01:38:16.692
I hate it.

01:38:24.165 --> 01:38:26.666
Can I talk to her?

01:38:26.668 --> 01:38:29.739
Hey, want to say, "Hello"?

01:38:30.771 --> 01:38:32.138
- Hello.
- Aw!

01:38:32.140 --> 01:38:34.006
She's tired.

01:38:34.008 --> 01:38:37.042
Well, at least you
haven't lost your looks.

01:38:38.713 --> 01:38:40.683
'Cause you never had 'em.

01:38:43.150 --> 01:38:45.018
- Dawn?
- Yeah?

01:38:45.020 --> 01:38:46.722
That picture.

01:38:50.158 --> 01:38:52.160
Make sure you keep
showing her.

01:38:53.128 --> 01:38:54.530
Yeah.

01:38:57.966 --> 01:38:59.866
Bye.

01:38:59.868 --> 01:39:02.671
Bye-bye.

01:39:04.105 --> 01:39:06.139
Oh!

01:39:06.141 --> 01:39:08.411
Let Grandpa have a go.

01:39:19.154 --> 01:39:21.156
Hey, champ.
Good to see you.

01:39:23.691 --> 01:39:25.190
I got some good news.

01:39:25.192 --> 01:39:28.060
Looks like they might overturn
that 650 Lifer Law.

01:39:28.062 --> 01:39:30.662
I talked to Byrd, and he
said that he and Snyder

01:39:30.664 --> 01:39:32.931
were willing to talk to
the board if it comes to pass.

01:39:32.933 --> 01:39:35.100
And if that happens,
you could be up for parole

01:39:35.102 --> 01:39:37.569
in, like, you know,
six years.

01:39:37.571 --> 01:39:39.906
That is good news.

01:39:39.908 --> 01:39:42.207
They're not gonna
get away with this, Ricky.

01:39:42.209 --> 01:39:44.877
You know, poked the lion
one too many goddamn times.

01:39:44.879 --> 01:39:48.081
- All right, Dad.
- It's like we always talked about, son.

01:39:48.083 --> 01:39:50.282
You got to lose a few battles
to win the war.

01:39:50.284 --> 01:39:53.455
We didn't talk about it.
You did.

01:39:54.522 --> 01:39:55.757
And the war is over.

01:40:01.829 --> 01:40:03.529
No, it's not, son.
Don't say that.

01:40:03.531 --> 01:40:06.034
- It's not over, you hear me?
- Look where I'm at.

01:40:08.235 --> 01:40:11.973
It's like I'm dead in here.
And that's how they want it.

01:40:28.289 --> 01:40:30.825
Eight pounds, 14 ounces.

01:40:32.226 --> 01:40:35.795
That's what you weighed
when you were born.

01:40:35.797 --> 01:40:38.598
Ricky, I remember the first
time I looked in your eyes,

01:40:38.600 --> 01:40:41.233
I knew you were
gonna be bigger than me.

01:40:41.235 --> 01:40:43.937
I knew your life was gonna
be bigger than mine.

01:40:43.939 --> 01:40:47.172
Not just in size, but in life,
in heart, in spirit.

01:40:47.174 --> 01:40:48.774
My life was hard, you know?

01:40:48.776 --> 01:40:51.577
Not yours.
Yours was gonna be easy.

01:40:51.579 --> 01:40:53.948
Gonna be so goddamn easy.

01:41:00.722 --> 01:41:02.124
And I fucked up.

01:41:07.596 --> 01:41:09.098
And I'm sorry.

01:41:15.604 --> 01:41:17.940
I'm so...

01:41:23.210 --> 01:41:25.812
You're my best friend, Rick.

01:41:25.814 --> 01:41:27.650
No, you're my only friend.

01:41:29.016 --> 01:41:31.216
You just remember
you got me and you got Dawn,

01:41:31.218 --> 01:41:32.751
you got your daughter,
all right?

01:41:32.753 --> 01:41:34.153
And we're not going anywhere.

01:41:34.155 --> 01:41:36.292
We're always gonna be
right here. All right?

01:41:38.293 --> 01:41:39.858
Hey, it don't end like this.

01:41:39.860 --> 01:41:41.627
All right?
Don't you give up on me.

01:41:41.629 --> 01:41:43.662
Ricky, hey,
it don't end like this.

01:41:43.664 --> 01:41:45.868
We're lions.
Hear me? We're lions.

01:44:12.280 --> 01:44:14.514
<i>I don't think there's a person</i>

01:44:14.516 --> 01:44:17.219
<i>that works here that
thinks I belong in prison.</i>

01:44:20.789 --> 01:44:23.488
<i>You don't know, having
that life sentence off of you,</i>

01:44:23.490 --> 01:44:26.091
<i>the stress that
it takes off of you</i>

01:44:26.093 --> 01:44:29.461
<i>and the foot that's been on
my chest for all these years.</i>

01:44:29.463 --> 01:44:32.031
<i>This is my thirtieth birthday
in prison,</i>

01:44:32.033 --> 01:44:35.300
<i>and, and it'll be
the best one, so...</i>

01:44:35.302 --> 01:44:39.337
<i>Oh, man, I feel overwhelmed
with joy, man.</i>

01:44:39.339 --> 01:44:41.273
<i>I mean, it's like,
I swear to God, man,</i>

01:44:41.275 --> 01:44:43.175
<i>I feel, like,
10 years younger.</i>

01:44:43.177 --> 01:44:46.946
<i>It's weird, like, so much
weight's been lifted off of me.</i>

01:44:46.948 --> 01:44:50.550
<i>"It's over. You're done.
Michigan paroled you."</i>

01:44:50.552 --> 01:44:52.121
<i>I cried, man.</i>

01:44:54.155 --> 01:44:55.354
<i>I cried.</i>

01:44:56.891 --> 01:44:59.058
<i>And I want to go tell
my grandma and grandpa</i>

01:44:59.060 --> 01:45:01.260
<i>that I made it
out of prison, you know?</i>

01:45:01.262 --> 01:45:04.397
<i>I want to go visit them
at their grave site.</i>

01:45:04.399 --> 01:45:07.201
<i>I got everything
I need in life.</i>
