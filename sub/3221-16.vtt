WEBVTT

00:03.456 --> 00:05.626
- Rufus Turner, the hunter.
- One of your friends?

00:06.092 --> 00:08.282
Good, you're home.
You gotta help me bury a body.

00:08.762 --> 00:12.952
Just something Samuel's been doing.
Catching things, grilling them for info.

00:13.733 --> 00:15.283
Grill? Torture, right?

00:19.039 --> 00:21.319
- You sold us out?
- What are you supposed to be to me?

00:21.808 --> 00:24.438
I'll tell you who I am.
I'm the guy you never wanna see again.

00:24.978 --> 00:28.228
The next time you see me,
I'll be there to kill you.

00:29.349 --> 00:30.839
- Hey.
- Gwen Campbell.

00:31.251 --> 00:34.591
- Third cousin. Grew up in the life, like us.
- I'm thinking you know purgatory.

00:35.255 --> 00:38.005
This is all about opening a door
to let something in.

00:38.558 --> 00:40.108
- What?
- I'm working on it.

00:40.493 --> 00:42.573
- Give us something?
- I got a name. Mother of All.

00:43.029 --> 00:46.369
We have so much to do.
Let's get started.

01:04.584 --> 01:07.334
- Whoa.
- I'm sorry. Did I scare you?

01:11.291 --> 01:13.161
You okay? You look a little...

01:13.593 --> 01:15.433
Well, I could use a ride.

01:20.033 --> 01:20.963
Okay.

01:23.336 --> 01:24.736
So, what's your name, sweetheart?

01:26.006 --> 01:27.966
- Eve.
- Eve. I'm Rick.

01:28.408 --> 01:30.778
- So how far you going, Eve?
- However far you want.

01:38.018 --> 01:41.918
Whoa. Whoa, Eve.
Look, you're very pretty...

01:42.622 --> 01:44.732
but this is not what's right for you.
Trust me.

01:45.191 --> 01:46.271
Then what's right for me?

01:51.431 --> 01:54.771
This emptiness you feel inside,
it's really a hunger for him.

01:55.402 --> 01:56.832
You do know Jesus was just a man?

01:57.203 --> 02:01.013
Sure. But he was also the son of God.
Sent here because he loves us.

02:01.708 --> 02:03.378
- God doesn't care about you.
- He does.

02:03.777 --> 02:06.147
Your father made you
and then abandoned you.

02:06.913 --> 02:09.523
So you pray.

02:11.050 --> 02:13.601
You see signs where there's nothing.
But truth is...

02:14.120 --> 02:16.960
your Apocalypse came and went,
and you didn't even notice.

02:17.924 --> 02:21.114
A mother would never abandon
her children like he did.

02:22.228 --> 02:24.128
- You'll see.
- See what?

02:25.065 --> 02:26.405
Can I tell you a secret?

03:17.417 --> 03:20.287
I been getting blasts from hunters
all week.

03:21.154 --> 03:24.664
Nest of vamps, werewolf dance party.

03:25.325 --> 03:29.105
Shifters, six of them.
Two hunters died taking them out.

03:29.796 --> 03:34.106
Ghouls, ghouls,
ghoul-wraith smorgasbord.

03:34.868 --> 03:37.588
- Is that a straight kick line down I-80?
- Exactly.

03:38.138 --> 03:40.508
Looks to me like
it's a Sherman march monster mash.

03:41.007 --> 03:42.877
Yeah, but where are they marching to?

03:45.078 --> 03:47.538
- What is it?
- Guy bashes in his family's heads.

03:53.853 --> 03:55.933
It's like I told the cops.

03:56.856 --> 03:57.936
I blacked out.

03:58.258 --> 04:00.658
Well, just tell us
what you do remember.

04:01.728 --> 04:05.358
Driving my regular route and then I...

04:06.366 --> 04:08.766
- I woke up in my truck at work.
- Where's work?

04:09.269 --> 04:10.199
Starlight Cannery.

04:11.271 --> 04:15.581
I didn't remember how I got there,
so I called home.

04:17.709 --> 04:21.579
When no one picked up,
I went there and I found...

04:22.849 --> 04:24.549
Anything unusual
before you blacked out?

04:25.385 --> 04:28.895
Sights, smells,
anything off the routine?

04:29.856 --> 04:33.136
Basic night. I was giving some kid
from the truck stop a ride.

04:33.993 --> 04:35.693
She took off.

04:36.796 --> 04:39.286
- I think she took off.
- Anything else?

04:39.799 --> 04:43.049
I swear, I didn't mean to do it, I...

04:44.404 --> 04:45.604
I loved them.

04:49.008 --> 04:51.818
So demon possession or ghosts?
I thought this was a monster thing.

04:52.378 --> 04:53.398
All right, here we go.

04:54.247 --> 04:55.677
Truck stop, night of the murders.

04:58.318 --> 05:00.128
That's him.

05:03.156 --> 05:04.996
Ooh. Hello.

05:08.828 --> 05:10.728
- Freakish nightmare. What was that?
- Bobby?

05:11.164 --> 05:12.834
I've never seen that in my life.

05:13.233 --> 05:15.423
All those vamps and ghouls
out on I-80...

05:15.902 --> 05:18.532
maybe they're coming in
for Mother's Day.

05:21.074 --> 05:22.244
Um...

05:23.309 --> 05:26.029
Heh. Okay, well, if that is Big Mama...

05:26.579 --> 05:29.599
whatever she is,
we got zero on ganking her.

05:30.183 --> 05:32.673
What are we gonna do
if we run into her? Throw salt and hope?

05:33.186 --> 05:35.586
No, we're gonna run
because we're in over our heads.

05:36.089 --> 05:39.079
We'd better get some real info
on this bitch before we do run into her.

05:39.659 --> 05:41.239
Hey, let's go.

05:43.196 --> 05:46.656
- What's the ruckus?
- Guy went postal down at the cannery.

05:47.300 --> 05:49.520
Okay. I'll go, you finish here.

06:00.580 --> 06:01.840
Excuse me.

06:12.825 --> 06:14.905
FBI. Willis. How many in there?

06:15.361 --> 06:16.531
- Six dead.
- What happened?

06:16.863 --> 06:20.843
A guy walks in, pulls a hunting rifle,
just opens fire. Captain, this is Agent...

06:21.601 --> 06:23.681
What, there a fed convention in town
or something?

06:24.137 --> 06:26.067
- I beg your pardon?
- Agent Willis.

06:28.641 --> 06:30.751
- Am I right?
- Agent.

06:31.711 --> 06:36.051
- Wasn't expecting you, yet.
- Well, apparently, you didn't get the call.

06:37.216 --> 06:39.386
Gentlemen, can you excuse us?

06:40.853 --> 06:42.633
What in the high holy
are you doing here?

06:43.056 --> 06:45.106
Same as you,
tracking 31 flavors of crazy...

06:45.558 --> 06:47.488
which led us both
into the middle of this.

06:47.927 --> 06:49.477
Right.

06:50.530 --> 06:51.730
Can we talk to the perp?

06:52.065 --> 06:55.435
Well, we can give it a shot. I don't know
if he's gonna talk back to us, though.

06:56.069 --> 06:58.149
Cops put eight bullets in him.

07:00.039 --> 07:00.999
So...

07:02.508 --> 07:04.698
- So, what?
- So are we partnering on this or not?

07:06.679 --> 07:08.409
Come on, man, it's not rocket surgery.

07:08.815 --> 07:11.065
We're here, let's do this.

07:11.551 --> 07:12.511
Just like old times.

07:13.152 --> 07:15.492
- As long as I get to drive.
- Heh, heh, heh.

07:15.988 --> 07:16.918
Hell, no.

07:25.431 --> 07:29.151
So do you think the Mother of Whatever
the Hell is wrapped up in this, Bobby?

07:29.836 --> 07:32.616
- Looks like.
- These are just guys going berserk...

07:33.172 --> 07:34.722
how's that a monster thing?

07:35.108 --> 07:38.178
I don't know.
That's why we're hacking him open.

07:44.083 --> 07:46.273
Hand me one of those swab things
over there.

07:58.865 --> 08:00.765
What have you got?

08:03.136 --> 08:05.126
That ecto?

08:08.741 --> 08:10.051
That's not ecto.

08:12.211 --> 08:14.051
What the hell is that?

08:14.480 --> 08:17.380
- It's something new.
- New?

08:17.950 --> 08:19.850
No such thing as new, Bobby.

08:20.286 --> 08:21.516
Well, it's something.

08:23.656 --> 08:27.026
Those guys who snapped,
one thing they had in common...

08:27.660 --> 08:30.380
they both worked
at that cannery joint.

08:48.047 --> 08:49.777
I don't even know
why you have a license.

08:50.183 --> 08:52.293
Well, look what the cat dragged in.

08:52.785 --> 08:55.095
- It really is good to see you, Rufus.
- I can believe it.

08:55.588 --> 08:58.898
It must get old, dealing with this
miserable cuss here all by yourselves.

08:59.525 --> 09:02.015
- Ha, ha. Is it that obvious?
- Why don't you get a room?

09:02.528 --> 09:04.778
- All right. We all pack a snack?
- Yeah.

09:05.264 --> 09:06.694
Let's see what we can see.

09:47.773 --> 09:49.503
- Gwen?
- Dean.

09:57.316 --> 09:58.546
Welcome to next time.

09:58.885 --> 10:00.345
- No, hold on.
- I said I'd kill him.

10:00.720 --> 10:01.800
Just a second.

10:05.925 --> 10:08.415
- I take it you know each other.
- He's our grandfather.

10:09.228 --> 10:12.358
Oh, somebody needs a hug.

10:12.965 --> 10:15.595
- Why are you here?
- We're working. You?

10:16.135 --> 10:18.185
- None of your business.
- Take Dean for a walk.

10:18.638 --> 10:21.188
- You gotta be kidding me.
- Look, Dean, it's fine.

10:22.141 --> 10:23.841
How?

10:31.884 --> 10:34.024
- What is wrong with you?
- Maybe he knows something.

10:34.487 --> 10:38.827
- You don't remember what he did. I do.
- I'm not saying don't, I'm saying not yet.

10:50.102 --> 10:52.762
So you're Samuel.

10:53.306 --> 10:55.386
You must be the guy pretending
to be their father.

10:55.841 --> 10:56.981
Well, somebody ought to.

11:00.346 --> 11:01.986
Sam.

11:02.915 --> 11:05.285
- You're looking well.
- Save the small talk, all right?

11:08.054 --> 11:10.244
- You seem different.
- I got my soul back.

11:10.723 --> 11:11.863
No thanks to you, I hear.

11:13.125 --> 11:14.055
You hear?

11:16.562 --> 11:17.552
You don't remember?

11:18.197 --> 11:19.187
I remember enough.

11:20.166 --> 11:23.536
I really hate to break up
this little circle of love...

11:24.170 --> 11:25.660
but why don't we talk shop, huh?

11:26.038 --> 11:28.848
How about you tell us
what it is you're hunting?

11:33.079 --> 11:35.949
Creature from purgatory.
She calls herself Eve.

11:37.216 --> 11:40.236
- Eve?
- Yup, but they call her Mother.

11:40.820 --> 11:43.250
She was here about 10,000 years ago.

11:43.756 --> 11:46.916
Every freak that walks the face
of the earth can be traced back to her.

11:47.727 --> 11:49.917
- And she's back.
- How the hell do you know all that?

11:50.396 --> 11:54.436
You don't know half the things I know.
Until recently, you didn't know about us.

11:55.167 --> 11:57.747
I now know that you'd throw
your own kin to hungry ghouls.

11:58.270 --> 11:59.820
I think I know enough.

12:00.740 --> 12:02.380
- You what?
- Dean lied to the man.

12:02.775 --> 12:05.525
- How about you ask Dean?
- Good idea.

12:14.520 --> 12:15.980
Dean?

12:17.123 --> 12:19.233
- Is it true?
- What?

12:19.692 --> 12:21.182
Did Samuel really try to...?

12:21.560 --> 12:23.580
Kill me? Yes.

12:24.697 --> 12:26.337
He didn't even blink.

12:26.732 --> 12:30.162
- That's the guy you're rolling with.
- He didn't tell me anything about that.

12:30.803 --> 12:32.093
I didn't know.

12:34.573 --> 12:35.503
I know.

12:38.044 --> 12:40.004
Honestly,
there's something I need to tell you.

12:40.446 --> 12:42.316
What?

12:58.531 --> 13:00.961
See if you can plug that hole up,
Bobby.

13:08.307 --> 13:09.737
Come on.

13:10.943 --> 13:11.933
Come on, girl.

13:13.713 --> 13:15.523
Come on.

13:17.116 --> 13:18.076
Come on.

13:19.218 --> 13:20.448
Come on.

13:23.222 --> 13:24.772
She's gone.

13:26.525 --> 13:27.635
Damn it.

13:31.497 --> 13:32.757
I'm sorry.

13:33.466 --> 13:34.756
If you care.

13:35.101 --> 13:36.301
Screw you. I care.

13:43.142 --> 13:44.542
Is she, uh...?

13:46.512 --> 13:47.972
- Where's Dean?
- I couldn't find him.

13:48.347 --> 13:50.517
Whatever got into those guys
must've got into Dean.

13:50.983 --> 13:54.903
Rufus, help Samuel move her
somewhere.

13:55.621 --> 13:58.021
Sam and I will lock down here.

13:58.524 --> 14:00.604
We're gonna wanna find Dean
before he finds us.

14:03.496 --> 14:07.416
We're gonna find him alive, Samuel,
or I'm gonna put a bullet into your head.

15:20.072 --> 15:22.092
Dean, put that damn thing down.

15:25.211 --> 15:27.761
Dean, put it down.

15:28.280 --> 15:30.890
You're the least of my worries
right now, Rufus.

15:31.417 --> 15:34.167
- Hey, hey, hey. Okay, both of you.
- Both of us, my ass.

15:34.720 --> 15:37.910
I'm not in the mood. I just had
a 12-inch harpy crawl out of my ear.

15:38.657 --> 15:40.147
- What?
- You heard me.

15:41.427 --> 15:45.967
I just woke up on the ground
just in time to see this worm thing...

15:46.765 --> 15:49.425
sliding out of my frigging ear
and into that vent.

15:50.769 --> 15:53.869
- So you tell me what's going on.
- You killed Gwen, that's what's going on.

15:56.275 --> 15:59.375
We were just talking out in the hallway.
That's the last thing I remember.

15:59.979 --> 16:02.059
That thing must've jumped me.

16:02.514 --> 16:05.204
So we're talking about,
like, a monster that gets in you?

16:05.918 --> 16:07.408
It's like a Khan Worm on steroids.

16:07.786 --> 16:09.896
You mean like a parasite
that took over your body?

16:10.389 --> 16:14.139
- Worm crawls in, your worm crawls out.
- Monster possession? That's novel.

16:14.827 --> 16:18.047
- What if that thing's still in you?
- It's not.

16:19.498 --> 16:21.368
Check your ear.

16:21.901 --> 16:23.711
What do you mean?
Check my ear for what?

16:24.136 --> 16:27.386
Hey! What...?
Why don't you buy me a drink first?

16:28.007 --> 16:30.227
Second date.
Oh, yeah, we're goo-positive.

16:30.709 --> 16:33.259
- What does that mean?
- Means it was in you, all right.

16:33.779 --> 16:35.239
- Or it still is.
- It's not in me.

16:35.614 --> 16:37.804
Okay. Everybody, give up your guns.

16:38.284 --> 16:40.364
- What?
- Whoa, think about this for a second.

16:40.819 --> 16:44.629
I'm thinking we don't know who is and
who ain't got the worm inside his melon.

16:45.324 --> 16:47.104
- It's not in me.
- I didn't say it was.

16:47.526 --> 16:51.336
Point is, we don't know who it is.
Could be any one of us.

16:53.132 --> 16:54.622
So the best we can do...

16:55.000 --> 16:59.220
is to make it that much harder
for that thing to blow our fool heads off.

17:29.234 --> 17:31.694
You waiting for a handwritten invite,
Campbell?

17:53.092 --> 17:54.702
Okay.

17:55.294 --> 17:57.754
We need some time to breathe.
Make a plan.

17:58.263 --> 17:59.903
A plan?

18:01.533 --> 18:03.783
- Based on?
- I'm gonna make a few phone calls.

18:04.269 --> 18:06.459
See if anybody ever heard
of anything like this.

18:06.939 --> 18:08.929
Hm. Ditto.

18:09.375 --> 18:11.655
I got a few trees I can shake.

18:12.144 --> 18:13.874
Oh, balls, Allard.

18:14.279 --> 18:16.589
Look, I told you that.

18:21.253 --> 18:23.063
Damn it.

18:36.402 --> 18:38.892
Relax. Bathroom break.

18:39.405 --> 18:41.715
So unless you wanna hold it for me...

19:00.492 --> 19:05.032
- Well, I got a dump truck full of bupkis.
- Nothing here either.

19:06.265 --> 19:08.605
- You call Willie?
- Of course, you think I'm an idjit?

19:10.102 --> 19:12.182
- How about Rog?
- Wouldn't talk to me.

19:12.638 --> 19:13.688
Yeah, me neither.

19:14.173 --> 19:17.273
Okay. Plan B.

19:19.812 --> 19:22.152
- Let's just go grab the thing.
- And then what exactly?

19:22.648 --> 19:25.838
Well, we sit on our thumbs
or we go in guns blazing.

19:26.452 --> 19:28.002
Like Omaha?

19:29.855 --> 19:33.195
You know what?
Screw you for bringing up Omaha.

19:33.826 --> 19:34.756
That's just low.

19:53.912 --> 19:55.582
What?

19:56.682 --> 19:59.172
Nothing. I'm just wondering
how you sleep at night.

20:00.018 --> 20:02.798
- Like a baby. Thanks for asking.
- You fed us to Crowley.

20:04.756 --> 20:06.946
True, but what am I gonna do
about it now?

20:07.426 --> 20:11.236
Do I blame you for wanting to kill me?
Of course not, Dean. What I did was...

20:16.135 --> 20:17.215
But I'm not apologizing.

20:18.504 --> 20:21.604
I did what I did.
I don't cry over spilt blood.

20:22.207 --> 20:25.167
So you really can just go on, like...

20:25.744 --> 20:27.614
Just because you're Dr. Jekyll
at the moment...

20:28.046 --> 20:30.676
doesn't mean you can get all mighty.
We spent a year together.

20:31.216 --> 20:33.406
Yeah, we did. We're blood.
And you still sold me out.

20:34.720 --> 20:38.410
Trust me, what I did
pales in comparison to what you did.

20:39.091 --> 20:41.431
- And on more than one occasion.
- Tell me what I did.

20:41.927 --> 20:43.797
No. Sam, come on.

20:45.697 --> 20:48.627
The only reason you're alive right now
is because we're working a job.

20:49.434 --> 20:50.774
The minute we kill this thing...

20:52.404 --> 20:53.454
you're next.

20:57.209 --> 20:59.399
Okay then, we'll just see.

21:10.589 --> 21:13.249
- Heard a shot.
- Samuel.

21:15.427 --> 21:17.327
I'm gonna be needing my gun back now,
Bobby.

21:17.763 --> 21:19.783
- You think?
- Yeah.

21:26.772 --> 21:29.702
Hey, don't feel bad.
You know, it was a good plan.

21:30.776 --> 21:33.466
Except for the part
where a monster would definitely not...

21:34.012 --> 21:36.352
- give up all his weapons.
- Shut up.

21:36.848 --> 21:38.598
We lost him.

21:40.819 --> 21:42.429
- What's the plan?
- We stick together.

21:42.821 --> 21:45.751
We gotta keep track of this thing
and who it's in.

22:01.807 --> 22:03.707
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Hey, hey, hey.

22:04.810 --> 22:06.830
Hold on, look.

22:23.662 --> 22:25.592
Booby trap.

22:26.298 --> 22:28.228
I'll be damned.

22:40.545 --> 22:42.475
Hey! Hey! Whoa.

22:42.914 --> 22:46.104
- Dean.
- Sam. Damn it.

22:49.655 --> 22:50.555
- Son of a bitch.
- Dean?

22:50.856 --> 22:52.526
- Sam?
- I'm gonna go around, okay?

22:52.924 --> 22:55.504
- All right, watch yourself.
- Yeah.

22:58.930 --> 23:00.360
Come on.

23:16.848 --> 23:18.628
Don't move.

23:19.685 --> 23:20.995
Sam.

23:21.353 --> 23:22.433
Put your gun down.

23:24.556 --> 23:26.636
What you gonna do, son?

23:27.859 --> 23:28.939
You're not gonna shoot me.

23:29.861 --> 23:32.051
You got your soul back.
Gonna shoot your own family?

23:32.531 --> 23:35.161
Yeah, I wouldn't go with
the family thing. Try again.

23:36.101 --> 23:38.381
- Mary's still my daughter.
- I said, don't move.

23:38.870 --> 23:41.860
- And you're still named after me.
- I said, don't move.

23:45.377 --> 23:46.687
Appears to be our moment, Sam.

23:48.747 --> 23:50.857
You still wanna know
about your summer vacation?

23:52.417 --> 23:53.677
I'll tell you all about it.

23:54.353 --> 23:55.993
You're dying to know, huh?

23:57.789 --> 23:58.809
Yeah, I am.

24:02.060 --> 24:04.050
- Then let's just put these down and talk.
- Stop.

24:04.496 --> 24:06.246
It's all right, Sam.

24:32.524 --> 24:34.074
Sam?

24:34.526 --> 24:36.106
Sam.

24:38.530 --> 24:40.400
Oh, thank God.

24:45.337 --> 24:47.267
Drop the gun, Sam.

24:57.749 --> 24:59.269
It's me.

24:59.751 --> 25:01.741
Okay. That's great, Sam.

25:02.721 --> 25:07.501
Just gotta cuff you till we can be sure.
Okay?

25:08.326 --> 25:09.586
You understand, right?

25:10.929 --> 25:12.919
- It's in him.
- Are you sure?

25:16.401 --> 25:19.771
- Yeah. Yeah, I think.
- You see anything come out of him?

25:20.505 --> 25:21.435
After he dropped?

25:31.550 --> 25:33.190
Tell me you got something.

25:35.086 --> 25:37.776
- Nothing.
- What?

25:38.757 --> 25:40.927
So you mean he wasn't a monster
when I ganked him?

25:44.062 --> 25:45.872
One way to find out.

25:46.298 --> 25:48.408
Bobby, you got a cranial saw
in the car?

25:48.867 --> 25:50.327
- Course.
- You're not going alone.

25:50.702 --> 25:52.252
Oh, no, he won't. He won't.

25:52.671 --> 25:56.711
We will both go grab some tools and see
about getting some power in this place.

25:57.442 --> 25:59.522
And I want you and you to wa...

25:59.978 --> 26:02.148
Okay, I want you and you
to watch him and him and...

26:02.614 --> 26:05.074
If anything crawls out of anybody,
somebody step on it.

26:05.584 --> 26:09.834
Don't worry. I'll watch Samuel.
Dean will watch me.

26:10.822 --> 26:12.692
Yeah, right.

26:32.077 --> 26:34.067
You did the right thing, you know.

26:35.714 --> 26:40.984
You mean, you think I did.
If it's in him and I'm me.

26:42.420 --> 26:44.320
This thing's playing
three-card monte with us.

26:45.090 --> 26:47.200
Well, I'm just gonna assume
you're you.

26:47.659 --> 26:49.739
You wanna take this off then?

26:52.797 --> 26:55.487
Not until we get that sucker
out of his walnut.

26:57.269 --> 26:58.879
I don't know.

27:00.338 --> 27:03.378
I mean, I barely remember him.
But what I do remember...

27:04.309 --> 27:05.889
it's not good.

27:06.278 --> 27:08.268
And what he did to us...

27:09.748 --> 27:11.938
- But...
- There's a but?

27:13.018 --> 27:15.208
I mean, I just can't help but think...

27:16.354 --> 27:18.404
what would Mom say?

27:21.993 --> 27:24.243
You know what I think
Mom would say?

27:25.630 --> 27:28.760
She'd say, "Just because your blood
doesn't make you family.

27:29.367 --> 27:30.797
You gotta earn that."

27:43.848 --> 27:45.898
All right, let's play operation.

27:49.788 --> 27:51.338
- Wanna take a breather?
- We're good.

27:51.723 --> 27:54.763
We're about to crack open your
grandpa's grapefruit. Take a breather.

28:19.818 --> 28:21.928
What is this,
have you been dumpster diving again?

28:22.387 --> 28:27.277
- What? It still works.
- Yeah, right. I hope so.

28:29.894 --> 28:32.794
- Listen, Rufus, I been thinking...
- Yeah, well wonders never cease.

28:34.599 --> 28:36.909
Shut up a minute,
I'm trying to say something.

28:39.738 --> 28:41.468
It was my fault.

28:42.540 --> 28:44.290
Omaha.

28:45.343 --> 28:47.563
- No, no, it wasn't.
- No, I should've listened to you.

28:48.046 --> 28:50.736
Well, hey, that's categorical, Bobby.

28:51.282 --> 28:54.092
I... Let me just get this out.

28:54.653 --> 28:56.263
We've had this conversation already.

28:56.655 --> 28:59.935
No, we haven't.
I never said I'm sorry, Rufus.

29:00.558 --> 29:02.548
I... You lost her because of me and I...

29:02.994 --> 29:06.334
Bobby, I said
we've had this conversation already.

29:07.298 --> 29:09.608
And you can blabber all day...

29:10.902 --> 29:12.802
and it wouldn't change a thing,
Bobby.

29:18.476 --> 29:22.256
I will never forgive you
for what happened.

29:24.182 --> 29:26.052
You got that?

29:26.951 --> 29:28.651
Never.

29:32.023 --> 29:33.663
So change the subject, Bob.

30:06.558 --> 30:08.198
Dean.

30:37.856 --> 30:40.636
- Rufus. Rufus. Rufus?
- Bobby. Hey, you all right?

30:41.192 --> 30:43.002
- Hey, hey, hey.
- You all right? I got you.

30:43.461 --> 30:44.601
- Come on.
- Come on, come on.

30:44.963 --> 30:46.393
You okay?

30:47.499 --> 30:50.429
This can't be my afterlife
because the three of you are here.

30:52.504 --> 30:55.634
- What happened?
- When we left, he was dead on the table.

30:56.241 --> 30:57.531
Yeah, till he wasn't.

30:58.510 --> 31:00.180
So how did he get double-dead?

31:00.578 --> 31:03.188
Bobby threw him against that.
I guess it was a live wire.

31:03.715 --> 31:07.875
It shorted and he went ape.
Then that thing crawled out of his ear.

31:08.620 --> 31:10.350
So at least we know what tickles it.

31:10.755 --> 31:12.655
- Electricity.
- Yeah.

31:13.091 --> 31:14.581
Now the question is where'd it go?

31:15.293 --> 31:16.403
- You see?
- No.

31:16.728 --> 31:18.398
- You two were down for the count.
- Yeah.

31:18.797 --> 31:22.957
Well, either it bailed
or it's in either one of you.

31:25.503 --> 31:28.223
Or it's in one of you.

31:28.773 --> 31:30.203
No, we were awake.

31:30.575 --> 31:32.595
- Did you have eyes on each other?
- Yes.

31:33.044 --> 31:35.214
One hundred percent of the time?

31:36.781 --> 31:39.441
- Define "a hundred."
- Like I said.

31:40.018 --> 31:43.268
All right, how about a check for goo,
right?

31:50.094 --> 31:51.354
Nothing.

31:55.800 --> 31:57.760
Might just be gone.

31:59.037 --> 32:01.997
No, it might've wised up
and covered its trail.

32:02.574 --> 32:05.264
All right, let's settle this, 100 percent.

32:05.810 --> 32:07.270
How?

32:16.454 --> 32:18.944
- You're live.
- Okay.

32:32.704 --> 32:34.434
All right.

32:43.381 --> 32:44.431
Okay.

32:45.650 --> 32:48.140
I'm not a doctor, but I'm gonna go ahead
and call this one.

32:49.087 --> 32:51.277
Yeah, all right. Who wants to go first?

32:54.325 --> 32:55.345
- Come on.
- Are you sure?

32:55.660 --> 32:57.560
Hurry up, before I start thinking...

33:00.298 --> 33:01.228
Son of a...

33:04.469 --> 33:05.809
Awesome.

33:06.170 --> 33:07.510
Here, you want me to...?

33:15.613 --> 33:17.753
- Let's go.
- Yep.

33:19.918 --> 33:22.088
Whoa, whoa, whoa, no.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I...

33:22.553 --> 33:23.843
No passes, Rufus. Come on.

33:24.188 --> 33:26.678
- I got a damn pacemaker.
- You better hope it's a good one.

33:27.525 --> 33:28.835
Since when you got a pacemaker?

33:29.193 --> 33:31.063
Since Bush Jr., term one.

33:31.829 --> 33:33.469
I'm down three toes too, FYI.

33:35.366 --> 33:36.656
All right, just make it quick.

33:43.341 --> 33:45.681
Damn it. Damn it.

33:46.177 --> 33:49.247
- You okay?
- No, I'm not okay. Give me that.

33:50.949 --> 33:52.819
Okay. All right. My turn.

33:53.785 --> 33:57.005
Well, it ain't inside me,
so go right ahead.

33:58.523 --> 34:00.893
- All right, then just stand still, Bobby.
- Okay, sure.

34:01.392 --> 34:02.762
- We make this quick.
- No problem.

34:03.161 --> 34:05.911
- All right? Let's do this.
- Okay. A second, Rufus.

34:08.065 --> 34:09.846
Just a sec nothing, whatever you are.

34:11.235 --> 34:12.844
- I'm Bobby.
- Bobby, my ass.

34:15.072 --> 34:16.382
Bobby!

34:18.609 --> 34:20.099
Rufus.

34:34.425 --> 34:36.614
Bobby, there are two of us
and one of you.

34:56.848 --> 34:59.158
Well, hey there, you little harpy.

35:05.490 --> 35:07.540
- Why do you keep talking about harpies?
- What?

35:09.260 --> 35:11.040
I don't. Shut up.

35:11.496 --> 35:13.106
Shut up.

35:15.466 --> 35:17.636
Don't even think about shagging ass
out of here...

35:18.102 --> 35:20.622
because we got every crack
in this room sealed.

35:21.139 --> 35:22.069
So get comfy.

35:22.373 --> 35:23.513
I am comfy.

35:24.809 --> 35:26.739
It's nice in here.

35:27.845 --> 35:30.685
And you love this guy, don't you?

35:32.717 --> 35:34.887
You really wanna kill me
and take him with me?

35:36.587 --> 35:40.157
- Haven't you lost enough pals today?
- We'll do what we have to do.

35:41.225 --> 35:44.355
Now, we got some questions for you.
So you can either play ball...

35:45.296 --> 35:47.256
or we can fry a little shrimp
on the barbie.

35:47.999 --> 35:48.989
Ask.

35:49.834 --> 35:51.854
Been waiting for you to ask.

35:52.303 --> 35:54.263
What the hell's
that supposed to mean?

35:54.906 --> 35:57.806
It means I got nothing to hide.

35:58.643 --> 36:01.713
- What are you?
- You haven't got a name for me yet.

36:02.613 --> 36:03.923
I'm new around here.

36:05.316 --> 36:07.776
Eve cooked me up herself.

36:17.728 --> 36:19.718
Who is she, this Eve bitch?

36:20.164 --> 36:22.384
The mother of all of us.

36:23.201 --> 36:25.391
And the end of all of you.

36:25.870 --> 36:27.800
By the time she's done...

36:28.239 --> 36:30.989
there'll be more creatures
than humans.

36:31.843 --> 36:33.803
You'll live in pens.

36:34.245 --> 36:37.145
We'll serve up your young
and call it veal.

36:37.715 --> 36:39.355
What's your deal in all of this?

36:39.750 --> 36:41.770
How's jumping a few truckers
gonna help?

36:42.220 --> 36:46.000
You think I'm here to mess
with a couple of cannery workers?

36:46.691 --> 36:48.651
- We led you here.
- Why?

36:49.393 --> 36:52.353
- She has a message for you.
- Oh, yeah? What's that?

36:53.397 --> 36:55.147
You're all gonna die.

36:56.701 --> 36:58.451
She's pissed.

36:58.870 --> 37:00.950
She's here.

37:01.439 --> 37:06.569
And it's gonna be nothing but pain
for you from here on in.

37:08.613 --> 37:09.923
Well, here's my response.

37:15.786 --> 37:17.956
Dean. Dean.

37:21.792 --> 37:23.632
How much more
do you think he can take?

37:24.061 --> 37:26.281
You can't kill me.

37:26.764 --> 37:28.814
Not without taking him with me.

37:33.437 --> 37:36.917
Well, we'll just have to do
what Bobby would want us to do.

37:51.322 --> 37:53.052
No way out now, Sluggo.

37:57.995 --> 37:59.015
Bobby, hang on in there.

38:19.183 --> 38:21.433
- Bobby?
- Is he...? Hey, hey.

38:27.692 --> 38:28.742
Bobby.

38:29.126 --> 38:30.736
- Bobby. Hey.
- He's not breathing.

38:31.562 --> 38:32.492
Bobby.

38:55.820 --> 38:58.750
I gotta say, I never figured Rufus
for the religious type.

38:59.423 --> 39:01.613
Well, he didn't exactly keep kosher.

39:02.126 --> 39:05.226
He always used to pull the old
"Can't work on the Sabbath" card...

39:05.830 --> 39:07.730
whenever we had to bury a body.

39:14.438 --> 39:16.928
You know, I was just a job.

39:18.342 --> 39:20.712
I was Joe Mechanic.

39:21.879 --> 39:24.249
Then my wife got possessed...

39:25.650 --> 39:27.760
went nuts on me.

39:29.186 --> 39:31.966
I stabbed her, that didn't stop her.

39:33.424 --> 39:37.324
Next thing I knew,
this guy comes busting in.

39:38.229 --> 39:42.239
Soaks her with holy water and sends
that demon straight to hell so fast.

39:45.202 --> 39:46.812
I'd have gone away for killing her.

39:50.608 --> 39:53.798
But Rufus cleaned up everything.

39:56.314 --> 39:58.594
Taught me a thing or two...

39:59.283 --> 40:01.623
about what's really out there.

40:04.088 --> 40:06.168
Pretty soon we were riding together.

40:06.794 --> 40:08.962
Worked like that for years,

40:09.046 --> 40:12.749
kind of like
you two knuckleheads.

40:12.800 --> 40:14.518
So, what happened?

40:17.438 --> 40:19.923
It was Omaha.

40:19.974 --> 40:23.760
It was my fault.

40:23.811 --> 40:25.862
And he never let it go.

40:25.930 --> 40:27.481
Well, he should have.

40:27.565 --> 40:29.032
You don't know
what I did, Dean.

40:29.099 --> 40:30.700
Doesn't matter.

40:30.768 --> 40:32.986
What do you mean, it doesn't...

40:33.070 --> 40:35.939
I mean at the end of the day,
you two are family.

40:35.990 --> 40:39.259
Life's short, and ours
are shorter than most.

40:39.327 --> 40:42.629
We're gonna spend it
wringing our hands?

40:42.713 --> 40:45.882
Something's gonna
get us eventually,

40:45.950 --> 40:48.117
and when my guts
get ripped out,

40:48.169 --> 40:51.054
just so you two know,
we're good.

40:51.121 --> 40:53.473
Blanket apology
for all the crap

40:53.558 --> 40:54.891
that anybody's done
all the way around.

40:54.959 --> 40:56.626
Some of us pulled
a lot of crap, Dean.

40:56.677 --> 40:59.095
Well, clean slate.

41:03.684 --> 41:04.568
Okay.
