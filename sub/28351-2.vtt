00:01.267 --> 00:01.467
.

00:12.267 --> 00:14.267
'The Geordies are back!'

00:14.333 --> 00:15.867
Hello!

00:15.933 --> 00:17.533
'Doing the things we love.'

00:18.367 --> 00:19.533
'But this time...'

00:20.267 --> 00:22.767
'...man's gonna mix things
right up.'

00:26.900 --> 00:28.000
(knocking)
(gasps)

00:28.067 --> 00:29.433
'With four newbies!'

00:29.500 --> 00:31.100
Oh, my God!

00:31.167 --> 00:32.767
It's gonna be fuckin' mint.

00:34.433 --> 00:37.533
'Anna's given the Geordie squad
a naughty facelift.'

00:37.600 --> 00:39.300
'I love a bit of change, me.'

00:40.567 --> 00:42.667
'But some things never change.'

00:45.267 --> 00:47.600
'I love this family.'

00:48.867 --> 00:51.400
(bell rings)
'Ding-fucking-ding, you dicks.'

00:51.467 --> 00:52.700
(cheering)

00:52.767 --> 00:54.767
Take it all in, bitch.

00:55.700 --> 00:58.600
Anna and Scott are sending
newbies.
I'm Tahlia.

00:58.667 --> 01:00.733
Hello?
'It's my best friend, Bethan!'

01:00.800 --> 01:02.133
(screams)

01:02.200 --> 01:04.300
I'm home!
This is my friend Natalie.

01:04.367 --> 01:06.100
'I am fucking buzzing.'

01:07.733 --> 01:10.267
Bethan and Beau
seem to be getting cosy...

01:11.667 --> 01:13.000
'Beau, pick one girl.'

01:14.267 --> 01:15.767
Who's a little girl?

01:15.833 --> 01:18.933
'Since Ivy's arrived,
everything's about her.'

01:19.000 --> 01:21.000
'Me and Chloe barely have sex.'

01:21.067 --> 01:22.867
Did youse get, er...
No.

01:22.933 --> 01:25.600
'Me and Tahlia both need to
get over our exes.'

01:25.667 --> 01:27.400
I was with him such a long time.

01:27.467 --> 01:30.167
'I really hope Nathan will be
OK.'
(sighs)

01:31.733 --> 01:33.633
I'm preened to perfection.

01:33.700 --> 01:35.800
I'm totally crackers, me, like.

01:35.867 --> 01:38.733
I'm a lad who's got more cheek
than a girl with fillers.

01:38.800 --> 01:40.900
Sometimes bubbly, sometimes
bitchy.

01:41.000 --> 01:42.400
I'm all over the place.

01:42.467 --> 01:45.200
I'm that good-looking,
I'd even neck on myself.

01:45.267 --> 01:48.000
I can talk the back legs
off a donkey.

01:48.067 --> 01:50.867
I might dance like a granddad,
but I'm proper radge.

01:50.933 --> 01:53.600
I'm fake, I'm flirty
and I've got double-Fs.

01:53.667 --> 01:57.067
I might look rough and ready,
but I'm a massive softie.

01:57.133 --> 02:00.433
I cannot believe anyone
would put me in charge of this
lot.

02:00.500 --> 02:02.700
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

02:16.767 --> 02:19.367
(Sam) What on Earth happened
when we got home?

02:19.433 --> 02:22.633
Fuck knows.
About Craig, can you remember?

02:22.700 --> 02:24.267
(grunts)
How do you feel now?

02:24.333 --> 02:26.567
I was just upset,
and I was just, like...

02:26.633 --> 02:27.967
I was in a mood.

02:28.033 --> 02:30.567
'Last night was going well
till the drink hit me

02:30.633 --> 02:32.500
and emotions got the better of
me.'

02:32.567 --> 02:35.867
'I wish that I wasn't still
hurting
and I could move on,

02:35.933 --> 02:38.300
but things don't happen
overnight.'

02:38.367 --> 02:41.900
I'd like to say I have my shit
together, but I really don't.

02:41.967 --> 02:45.967
You're in the unknown.
You don't know what's gonna hit
you.

02:46.033 --> 02:47.467
You're in limbo.

02:47.533 --> 02:52.700
I am a 27-year-old sexy,
handsome, strong, 6'5"...

02:52.767 --> 02:54.367
...6'4", sorry, guy.

02:54.433 --> 02:57.133
'There is someone out there
that's gonna love me.'

02:57.200 --> 03:00.467
'Unfortunately,
I haven't met him yet.' (laughs)

03:02.033 --> 03:04.367
In the club,
did you get a three-way neck on?

03:04.433 --> 03:05.600
Oh, aye.

03:05.667 --> 03:10.000
Tahlia, Bethan and Beau
in a three-way kiss? Go on, lad.

03:10.067 --> 03:11.533
So, Beau...

03:11.600 --> 03:14.000
If you had to choose,
who was better?

03:14.067 --> 03:16.633
I think I was kissing myself
more than them two.

03:16.700 --> 03:19.967
I'm loving the attention.
Little bit of flirting, banter.

03:20.033 --> 03:22.533
'If the house is all like this,
bring it on.'

03:22.600 --> 03:24.433
I think with everything going
on,

03:24.500 --> 03:27.200
it's probably safer
that I don't go out.

03:27.267 --> 03:30.467
We should throw a house party.
Yes!

03:30.533 --> 03:33.067
There is no better time
to throw a house party.

03:33.133 --> 03:36.333
We've got all these newbies,
and I need cheering up.

03:36.400 --> 03:39.100
The last time I was single
and having loads of fun

03:39.167 --> 03:42.500
was at Uni, so I think we should
have a fresher's-themed party.

03:42.567 --> 03:45.367
Yes. It looks like a fresher's
pad.
Does it?

03:48.867 --> 03:52.300
Didn't Bethan and Tahlia
have a three-way neck-on?

03:52.367 --> 03:54.967
'I can't believe
they had a three-way neck-on.'

03:55.033 --> 03:57.233
These newbies are right at home
with us.

03:57.300 --> 03:58.533
Do you even like him?

03:58.600 --> 04:00.800
It was only, like, cos he was
there.

04:00.867 --> 04:03.867
I don't want you to worry about
falling out with me.

04:03.933 --> 04:06.867
Cos in the end,
I'd rather neck on with you
anyway.

04:06.933 --> 04:10.067
So, is there no competition?
No, I wouldn't say so.

04:10.133 --> 04:12.767
Last night's kiss was fun,
but that's all.

04:12.833 --> 04:15.833
If Bethan wants to crack on,
I'm not gonna get in the way.

04:15.900 --> 04:17.632
Morning.
Trash.

04:17.700 --> 04:18.833
Hello, Princess.

04:18.899 --> 04:21.067
I'm not enjoying going out.

04:21.132 --> 04:23.533
I don't want to go out
and have a breakdown.

04:23.600 --> 04:26.767
So, I think tonight,
we should have a house party.

04:26.833 --> 04:30.333
(Bethan) Yes! I can't wait to
host
my first-ever house party.

04:30.400 --> 04:31.933
Tonight is gonna be wicked.

04:32.000 --> 04:34.167
So, the theme is fresher's.

04:34.233 --> 04:36.700
I really like that idea, Nathan.
Thank you.

04:36.767 --> 04:39.933
House party!
I'm so excited.

04:50.267 --> 04:51.933
Chloe!
What do you want?

04:52.000 --> 04:53.833
Come here.

04:53.900 --> 04:56.100
We've been in the house
a couple of days,

04:56.167 --> 04:58.567
and I know that Chloe
is missing baby Ivy.

04:58.633 --> 05:00.533
And we need some more girl time.

05:00.600 --> 05:02.767
So I've organised a surprise for
her.

05:02.833 --> 05:04.567
What? Not pregnant, are you?

05:04.633 --> 05:07.167
No. I've got a surprise for you.

05:07.233 --> 05:10.000
What is it?
I'm not telling you. You'll see.

05:10.067 --> 05:11.567
But you're gonna love it.

05:11.633 --> 05:15.533
What possibly could it be?
Chocolate? A sandwich? A prawn?

05:15.600 --> 05:18.633
Are you taking us for a meal?
Even better than that, mate.

05:18.700 --> 05:20.467
(gasps) Shall we get ready?

05:20.533 --> 05:22.900
This surprise for Chloe
is gonna be mint.

05:22.967 --> 05:25.433
No-one's ever surprised us
in this house.

05:25.500 --> 05:26.933
Not even my own boyfriend.

05:31.400 --> 05:33.433
Youse,
I'm so excited for this party.

05:33.500 --> 05:36.767
Gutted if my friends don't come.
Imagine none turn up!

05:36.833 --> 05:38.100
Right, losers!

05:42.000 --> 05:44.200
Bye. Losers!

05:44.267 --> 05:47.900
'Hang on, Bethan's taking Chloe
out?
Shouldn't that be me?'

05:48.667 --> 05:50.867
'This is why me and Bethan
are friends.'

05:50.933 --> 05:54.367
It's not even my birthday,
and she's organised me a
surprise!

05:55.567 --> 05:58.367
(horn honks)
(cheers) We're free, bitches!

06:03.733 --> 06:07.233
I'm very excited, I think this
is
going to be a brilliant day.

06:07.300 --> 06:10.567
I know. This is the best
surprise
I'll ever have for you.

06:10.633 --> 06:11.900
Fuck.

06:14.367 --> 06:16.100
Right. Is that my mam?

06:17.067 --> 06:18.867
Oh, my God. Is that Ivy?

06:18.933 --> 06:20.433
Right, is that a joke?

06:20.500 --> 06:23.033
'Oh, my God, I'm so happy!'

06:23.100 --> 06:24.667
Oh, my God!

06:24.733 --> 06:26.367
Ow, that really hurt my boobs.

06:27.700 --> 06:30.233
Hello! Hello! Hello!

06:30.300 --> 06:32.567
Hello! (makes kissing noises)

06:35.167 --> 06:37.633
Oh, I've missed you so much!
Woof, woof, woof!

06:37.700 --> 06:39.700
Come on, let's go for a walk,
lasses.

06:39.767 --> 06:42.933
And my little girl! Come on,
then!

06:43.000 --> 06:46.567
I have been looking after Ivy.
I've brought them two coffees.

06:46.633 --> 06:49.900
Not one of them have said,
"How're you doing?" Great.

06:50.800 --> 06:53.033
Good girl. Sit.
I have been training her.

06:53.100 --> 06:54.333
Oh, she's done it!

06:54.400 --> 06:56.533
Oh, good girl!

06:56.600 --> 06:59.300
Can you believe Bethan's
in the house! I'm shocked!

06:59.367 --> 07:01.567
My face, I went... (gasps)

07:01.633 --> 07:03.233
She was shocked.
So shocked.

07:03.300 --> 07:06.467
And it's good for me, cos I
haven't
had anyone in the house.

07:06.533 --> 07:07.667
I feel a lot better.

07:07.733 --> 07:09.400
I'm absolutely buzzing

07:09.467 --> 07:12.500
that Chloe feels more
comfortable
now that I'm here.

07:12.567 --> 07:14.100
'What are best mates for?'

07:14.167 --> 07:17.500
So, there's a boy called Beau...
I'll let Bethan explain.

07:17.567 --> 07:20.367
Me and Beau have started
getting on really well.

07:20.433 --> 07:22.733
But I'm just playing it cool.

07:22.800 --> 07:25.000
I've known Bethan
since she was a bairn.

07:25.067 --> 07:28.400
With her, anything to do with
boys,
there'll be trouble.

07:28.467 --> 07:30.267
(makes kissing noises) Kisses.

07:30.333 --> 07:32.467
Oh, bye, baby.

07:32.533 --> 07:34.400
Bethan has done amazing.

07:34.467 --> 07:37.400
'I feel so much better
now I've seen Ivy.'

07:42.533 --> 07:46.133
Wait...
Is that a fucking joke?!

07:46.200 --> 07:48.367
Oh, my God! Scrunchies!
Boater shoe!

07:48.433 --> 07:53.833
I can't fucking wait for
tonight,
cos Fresher's is going off.

07:53.900 --> 07:55.433
Mate, what you doing?

07:55.500 --> 07:58.000
My first party.
I hope my friends can make it.

07:58.067 --> 07:59.800
It's gonna be absolutely nuts.

07:59.867 --> 08:01.867
Hi, baby. I've missed you so
much.

08:01.933 --> 08:05.867
We're having a house party
tonight,
I want you to come.

08:05.933 --> 08:07.467
"Definitely, I'd love to."

08:07.533 --> 08:11.400
I am enjoying being in this
house,
but I'm missing my girlfriend.

08:11.467 --> 08:14.233
Having her at the house party
would make my day.

08:14.300 --> 08:17.033
All right, I love you, baby.
Bye, puppy.

08:17.100 --> 08:19.733
Oh, I love hearing her voice!

08:20.600 --> 08:23.567
Missing you very, very, very,
very, very, very much.

08:23.633 --> 08:25.033
"I miss you, too."

08:25.100 --> 08:27.767
We are having a house party.

08:27.833 --> 08:31.600
Would you like to come to the
party?
"Course, I'd love to come."

08:31.667 --> 08:34.567
My boyfriend's already met
Nathan and Chloe,

08:34.633 --> 08:38.200
but this is the first time
he's gonna be meeting the
family.

08:38.267 --> 08:39.866
Talk about nerve-racking!

08:41.567 --> 08:44.900
We've got the guests, now we
need
to get this fuckin' ready.

08:46.667 --> 08:48.500
Let's party, bitches!

08:49.400 --> 08:51.500
What are these for?

08:51.567 --> 08:54.400
'This is the first house party
I've ever thrown.'

08:54.467 --> 08:56.500
It's gonna go off!

08:56.567 --> 08:58.900
The party has begun, guys.
(cheering)

09:01.967 --> 09:05.633
(Chloe) Go on, then!
Flappin' like a fuckin' bird.

09:06.733 --> 09:09.267
Hello!
(all cheer)

09:09.333 --> 09:11.967
Catch!
(laughter)

09:12.033 --> 09:15.400
Fuckin' hell, Sam. Watch my
filler.
It nearly popped out!

09:15.467 --> 09:17.267
I got to see my dog...
How was she?

09:17.333 --> 09:19.900
Oh, she went mad!
We took her on a walk.

09:19.967 --> 09:22.467
I know Chloe's been sad
cos she hasn't seen Ivy.

09:22.533 --> 09:24.567
Telling how much of a good day
we had,

09:24.633 --> 09:27.633
but Sam's face looks like
he's got a smacked arse.

09:27.700 --> 09:30.300
Hang on.
Why was I not invited to see my
dog?

09:30.367 --> 09:33.433
Ooh! Jealous, are we?
No, I just want to see my dog.

09:33.500 --> 09:35.500
Not only been to see my dog,

09:35.567 --> 09:39.167
but she's took my girlfriend
and used my car?

09:39.233 --> 09:40.867
Is she taking the piss?

09:40.933 --> 09:42.567
What do you think?
Amazing.

09:42.633 --> 09:45.033
Let's get ready.
Get your fuckin' tits out!

09:45.100 --> 09:46.900
Let's get ready for tonight.

09:46.967 --> 09:48.900
House party, bitches!

09:52.367 --> 09:54.633
Being single
isn't as bad as I thought.

09:54.700 --> 09:57.567
Having Jay here made us realise
how much I miss him.

09:57.633 --> 09:58.700
Why am I here?

09:58.767 --> 10:00.567
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

10:03.033 --> 10:03.233
.

10:05.767 --> 10:05.967
.

10:23.300 --> 10:27.467
Tonight is my favourite night
of being in the house: a house
party.

10:31.767 --> 10:35.267
It is going to be good, you
know.
I'm so excited for my first one.

10:35.333 --> 10:37.633
I'm so pumped.
So pumped? Are you American?

10:37.700 --> 10:39.967
This is the newbies'
first house party.

10:40.033 --> 10:42.100
They are not gonna know
what's hit 'em.

10:42.167 --> 10:45.833
She finally admitted today
that she likes Beau.

10:45.900 --> 10:47.400
He is really fit.

10:47.467 --> 10:48.833
What about you, Tal?

10:48.900 --> 10:52.900
I'm looking forward to seeing
other fitties. See who comes in.

10:56.367 --> 10:58.833
(belches)
(Nat) Stop it.

10:58.900 --> 11:00.833
Listen up, class is in session!

11:00.900 --> 11:03.300
Class! Is! In! Session!

11:03.367 --> 11:04.833
What're you dressed as?

11:04.900 --> 11:06.267
The headmaster.

11:06.333 --> 11:08.300
I am feeling this outfit.

11:08.367 --> 11:11.000
If this doesn't say sexy,
I don't know what does.

11:11.067 --> 11:13.600
Listen, I'm excited.
You should be excited.

11:15.067 --> 11:18.800
I am so ready for tonight,
I am literally pumped.

11:18.867 --> 11:22.267
You should be, you're going to
get the sex, looking like that.

11:22.333 --> 11:24.667
You look adorable.
Let's get a drink.

11:25.700 --> 11:27.800
(cheering)

11:27.867 --> 11:31.233
(Chloe) This is the first house
party with the newbies here,

11:31.300 --> 11:35.200
and I cannot wait to show them
how good a Geordie party is.

11:35.267 --> 11:37.533
To the newbies' first house
party.

11:37.600 --> 11:39.567
(all repeat)

11:39.633 --> 11:42.333
Let's get fuckin'...
(all) Mortal!

11:43.767 --> 11:45.900
The Fresher's house party is
ready,

11:45.967 --> 11:48.500
now let's get a degree
and get mortal.

11:50.600 --> 11:52.000
(shrieks)

11:52.067 --> 11:55.667
Yes! My friends have arrived. I
can
tell it's gonna be a wicked
night.

12:00.100 --> 12:03.100
Thank fuck my lass, Abi,
is finally here.

12:03.167 --> 12:04.400
She looks fit.

12:06.567 --> 12:09.367
I can't wait to spend
the rest of the night with her.

12:10.600 --> 12:12.567
(cheers)

12:14.433 --> 12:16.267
I am so glad to see Jay.

12:16.333 --> 12:19.900
And the fact that he's just
grabbed my arse, swung us around

12:19.967 --> 12:23.200
and given us the most amazing
kiss
shows he is a keeper.

12:26.700 --> 12:29.167
Nathan's Fresher's party
is in full swing.

12:29.233 --> 12:31.567
All my friends and family
are around,

12:31.633 --> 12:34.267
and hopefully it goes better
than last night.

12:44.900 --> 12:50.033
'Sophie and Jay are so cute, and
I can tell he's the one for
her.'

13:09.833 --> 13:12.400
Chloe's put Jay in
an awkward situation.

13:12.467 --> 13:16.667
Why would my boyfriend tell her
boyfriend how to treat his girl?

13:34.600 --> 13:37.333
I can't believe Chloe is the one
having a go at me.

13:37.400 --> 13:40.500
She's the one spending all her
time
with Bethan.

13:40.567 --> 13:42.367
It should be me having a go!

14:02.267 --> 14:03.733
Shit. I've pissed Sam off.

14:03.800 --> 14:07.100
I know for a fact I'm not
getting
any more attention tonight.

14:13.433 --> 14:16.000
I couldn't wish for
a better first party.

14:16.067 --> 14:18.400
I'm starting to feel like
I'm fitting in,

14:18.467 --> 14:20.267
and to top it off, I'm mortal.

14:32.967 --> 14:36.333
Having my girlfriend here,
meeting everyone, having a
laugh,

14:36.400 --> 14:38.100
is making my night perfect.

14:56.133 --> 14:58.133
(whoops)

14:58.200 --> 15:00.767
Natalie's girl cannot walk past
without a kiss.

15:00.833 --> 15:02.167
Sam would never do that.

15:14.533 --> 15:18.200
I can't believe this lot are
thrusting relationships in my
face.

15:18.267 --> 15:21.233
Have some fucking empathy,
people,
please!

15:29.367 --> 15:32.267
I don't wanna surround myself
with these lot,

15:32.333 --> 15:34.067
talking about their partners.

15:34.133 --> 15:37.400
This is my bloody party,
and it's full of sausage.

15:37.467 --> 15:40.833
And everyone knows I love
sausage.

15:45.233 --> 15:47.400
Beau is looking fitter than
usual,

15:47.467 --> 15:50.800
and the more time I spend with
the lad, the more I fancy him.

15:56.500 --> 15:58.200
This house party's class!

15:58.267 --> 16:00.533
'Bethan's looking canny fit,
too.'

16:06.767 --> 16:10.667
Everyone's mortal, and I'm
loving
the attention from all the boys.

16:10.733 --> 16:13.767
Maybe being single isn't
as bad as I thought.

16:25.900 --> 16:28.467
Me and Chloe have been together
for a long time,

16:28.533 --> 16:31.700
and she needs to realise
it's not gonna be like the early
days

16:31.767 --> 16:33.500
where we're all over each other.

16:41.233 --> 16:43.933
'Yes, Sam should be giving me
more attention.'

16:44.000 --> 16:46.400
But the way I went about it
was the wrong way.

16:48.300 --> 16:50.767
No-one can resist a lovely
doughnut.

16:54.900 --> 16:56.367
'Oh, look at that face.'

16:56.433 --> 17:00.733
Maybe I do need to give that
lass
a little bit more attention.

17:11.967 --> 17:15.567
'After last night,
it's so nice to see Nathan
happy.'

17:15.633 --> 17:17.400
He's like a giddy schoolgirl.

17:19.833 --> 17:22.700
I love a guy with a beard.
(roars)

17:22.767 --> 17:24.032
Go on, Nathan!

17:24.833 --> 17:30.233
Oh, my God! Nathan is getting it
on
with a lad! Get in there, about
time!

17:31.267 --> 17:33.867
Yes, Nathan! That's my boy.

17:35.833 --> 17:37.433
It might have only been a peck,

17:37.500 --> 17:40.600
but this is the first boy
I've locked lips with since my
ex.

17:40.667 --> 17:42.167
This is a big step.

17:49.167 --> 17:52.133
Right, I'm smashed and horny.

17:52.200 --> 17:54.833
Which one of you lucky boys
wants a lapdance?

17:58.600 --> 18:02.033
(cheering)

18:04.567 --> 18:08.700
Finally, Nathan's took my advice
and is embracing being single.

18:10.533 --> 18:13.200
Enjoy the sausages on the menu,
hun.

18:18.100 --> 18:21.700
This floor is properly slippery.
I can't even walk.

18:21.767 --> 18:23.200
(laughs)

18:26.067 --> 18:27.733
Oops! Beau slipped over.

18:27.800 --> 18:30.067
That's convenient. Not
complaining.

18:40.233 --> 18:43.567
I can now pronounce this
the best house party ever!

18:45.200 --> 18:46.767
Class dismissed.

18:54.633 --> 18:56.700
(Jay) How're you feeling?
I just...

18:56.767 --> 18:59.567
I don't get why I would
let my boyfriend go home.

18:59.633 --> 19:02.333
'Jay's got work
and can't stay for the night,

19:02.400 --> 19:04.400
and it's making me emotional.'

19:04.467 --> 19:07.533
I have loved having Jay here,
but at the same time,

19:07.600 --> 19:09.967
it's making it really hard
to say bye to him.

19:10.033 --> 19:12.567
I've seen you, all I wanna do
is go home with you.

19:12.633 --> 19:14.833
By tomorrow,
you'll wake up and think,

19:14.900 --> 19:19.233
"I'd have loved to go back,"
but you'd have been thinking,

19:19.300 --> 19:22.400
"Fuck, I've just left
all my friends in there."

19:22.467 --> 19:25.267
But in my head,
all that matters is me and you.

19:25.333 --> 19:26.733
Why am I here?

19:26.800 --> 19:29.667
Having Jay here made us realise
how much I love him,

19:29.733 --> 19:31.067
and how much I miss him.

19:31.133 --> 19:32.700
But I've got a job here,

19:32.767 --> 19:35.500
and I'm gonna stay
for the sake of the family.

19:35.567 --> 19:37.567
See youse later.
See you later, mate.

19:37.633 --> 19:39.533
Ta-ra, mate.
Ta-ra.

19:39.600 --> 19:41.833
Don't be upset, all right?
OK. I love you.

19:46.633 --> 19:48.367
Goodnight. Goodnight.

19:48.433 --> 19:51.000
Goodnight, Nathan.
Sophie. Are you all right?

19:51.067 --> 19:52.833
Yeah. Night.

19:52.900 --> 19:55.667
Sophie is my best friend,
inside and outside.

19:55.733 --> 19:58.167
I can tell when she's upset
and needs to talk.

20:01.900 --> 20:04.567
Oh, yah...
Baby.

20:04.633 --> 20:06.200
Hi, doll.

20:06.267 --> 20:09.767
I wanna leave with my boyfriend,
like, right now.

20:09.833 --> 20:11.800
Sophie, I don't judge you for
that.

20:11.867 --> 20:14.167
Sophie is our rock in this
house.

20:14.233 --> 20:16.767
Without her,
who would I get advice from?

20:16.833 --> 20:19.967
I think all I wanna do now
is just ride it out.

20:20.033 --> 20:21.567
If the time comes, it comes.

20:21.633 --> 20:23.633
Don't cry.
Don't... Don't...

20:23.700 --> 20:25.467
Oh, Nathan, don't cry.

20:25.533 --> 20:29.600
Nathan's my best friend in here,
and I don't know how he'd cope

20:29.667 --> 20:31.367
if I wasn't here right now.

20:42.400 --> 20:44.433
Me first house party has been
mint,

20:44.500 --> 20:47.667
but a cheeky cuddle with Bethan
would be the perfect end.

20:47.733 --> 20:50.400
Oh... are you gonna leave me?

20:50.467 --> 20:52.400
One cuddle on the settee.

20:52.467 --> 20:54.267
Is this what you're gonna be
like?

20:54.333 --> 20:56.500
Beau might come across
like a fuckboy,

20:56.567 --> 20:59.000
but the fact he doesn't
want to take it further

20:59.067 --> 21:00.733
makes us like him even more.

21:00.800 --> 21:03.867
I feel like I'm gonna see
in the morning.

21:03.933 --> 21:07.500
I've really enjoyed spending
time
with Beau, but it's time for
bed.

21:13.233 --> 21:17.167
How can Chloe say that I'm not
affectionate? I'm brushing her
teeth!

21:19.300 --> 21:21.900
If that's not affectionate,
I don't know what is!

21:25.300 --> 21:27.267
I might just go to bed,
actually.

21:28.067 --> 21:30.100
I can't wait to spoon my lass
tonight.

21:34.367 --> 21:36.900
'What a party, and what a
night.'

21:36.967 --> 21:39.233
All that's left to do now
is stuff my face

21:39.300 --> 21:42.567
and think of all the hot boys
I've flirted with.

21:42.633 --> 21:44.600
(sighs) I've loved it.

21:52.733 --> 21:54.533
Beep fucking beep.

21:54.600 --> 21:57.000
Tahlia and Beau, neck on.

21:57.067 --> 21:58.867
I'm actually fucking raging.

21:58.933 --> 22:00.933
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

22:03.500 --> 22:03.700
.

22:06.200 --> 22:06.400
.

22:22.000 --> 22:26.133
(Nat) 'I am absolutely
devastated
that Abi has had to go home.'

22:26.200 --> 22:29.833
It is really hard, having a
relationship outside of this
house.

22:29.900 --> 22:32.333
'I don't know when
I'm gonna see her again.'

22:38.100 --> 22:39.733
Morning.

22:39.800 --> 22:42.467
Good morning!
Stop being so loud.

22:42.533 --> 22:44.433
Good morning!
Stop being so loud.

22:44.500 --> 22:47.433
Good morning, light!
You are on borrowed time.

22:47.500 --> 22:50.000
'Normally, I wake up hanging.'

22:50.067 --> 22:54.633
But this morning, I've woke up
and I feel fresh, like a daisy.

22:54.700 --> 22:56.533
So, last night, youse, right...

22:56.600 --> 22:59.333
I did have a... it wasn't a
neck-on,
a cheeky peck.

22:59.400 --> 23:00.567
Boring!
Boring.

23:00.633 --> 23:02.567
Going back to sleep.
Bored of that.

23:02.633 --> 23:05.300
Boring.
This is why I don't tell you.

23:05.367 --> 23:08.700
I'm playing this down because
I don't want to make a big deal.

23:08.767 --> 23:10.000
But it is a big deal!

23:10.067 --> 23:12.300
Not supportive. Freaks.

23:14.733 --> 23:16.800
How'd you feel about Jay being
here?

23:16.867 --> 23:19.433
I had an emotional breakdown
last night.

23:19.500 --> 23:21.433
Cos I just wanted to leave with
Jay.

23:21.500 --> 23:23.267
I just wanted to leave with him.

23:23.333 --> 23:25.733
But I didn't think
it was the right time.

23:25.800 --> 23:27.900
Last night was a rollercoaster.

23:27.967 --> 23:30.300
But I am glad I didn't leave.

23:30.367 --> 23:33.067
I do still love
living with these radgies.

23:33.133 --> 23:37.033
Abi walked through the door,
thought
I was gonna need a
defibrillator.

23:37.100 --> 23:38.833
Did youse do bits?
Nah.

23:38.900 --> 23:40.667
Not even one finger?
Nah.

23:40.733 --> 23:42.700
What about a thumb?
Nah.

23:42.767 --> 23:44.500
Not even a pinkie.

23:53.700 --> 23:54.933
What the fuck?

23:55.033 --> 23:56.167
Oh, God...

23:56.233 --> 23:59.567
What the fuck is that noise
outside?
It sounds like a boat!

23:59.633 --> 24:00.733
(horn blares)

24:00.800 --> 24:03.100
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
What is it?!

24:03.167 --> 24:07.533
Anna wanted to get a bus, so
these
divvies can do Tash On Tours in
it.

24:07.600 --> 24:11.233
Well, Scotty T's went all out.
He's only pulled this out the
bag!

24:11.300 --> 24:12.967
Beep fucking beep.

24:13.033 --> 24:15.267
There's a big bus outside!

24:15.333 --> 24:17.500
Hello, hello, hello, hello!

24:17.567 --> 24:20.433
I mean, I know I'm already
packing a double-decker,

24:20.500 --> 24:22.967
but fucking hell,
this thing is ridiculous!

24:24.133 --> 24:26.733
This is your home away from
home,

24:26.800 --> 24:29.600
so fuckin' respect it,
cos it cost a lot of money.

24:29.667 --> 24:32.000
How long are we gonna be
on the bus for?

24:32.067 --> 24:36.167
You're going today to do work.
You never know when it might
rock up.

24:36.233 --> 24:38.400
Do you wanna have a look on the
bus?

24:38.467 --> 24:41.100
What the...

24:41.867 --> 24:44.167
What the fuck?

24:44.233 --> 24:47.400
Youse! How amazing is this?!
Oh, my God!

24:47.467 --> 24:50.300
Beyonce has got one of these,
Little Mix has got one,

24:50.367 --> 24:52.667
and now Nathan Henry
has got one of these.

24:52.733 --> 24:54.233
Youse, there's ten beds.

24:54.300 --> 24:56.333
They're so comfortable, as well!

24:56.400 --> 25:00.167
We're all gonna be sleeping in
the
same room, this is so nice!

25:00.233 --> 25:01.733
This is great.

25:01.800 --> 25:04.400
This is class.
I can't wait to be a bus wanker.

25:04.467 --> 25:06.233
Youse have got Tash On Tours...

25:07.567 --> 25:10.733
...and today going to work,
Nathan...
I'm OK with that.

25:10.800 --> 25:13.533
...Chloe, Tahlia, and Beau.

25:13.600 --> 25:16.133
Youse are gonna take people
round Newcastle.

25:16.200 --> 25:18.767
(cheering)

25:18.833 --> 25:21.033
I can't believe
I get to work on the bus.

25:21.100 --> 25:23.867
It'll be a good chance to bond
with Chloe and Nathan.

25:23.933 --> 25:26.667
Youse need to put these on...
No, man!

25:26.733 --> 25:28.733
Listen, I dress cool now, I
can't...

25:28.800 --> 25:30.933
Oh, my God, it says his name on.

25:31.000 --> 25:32.467
The rest of youse...

25:32.533 --> 25:35.700
...cos I bet that's a state in
there,
can clean the house.

25:35.767 --> 25:36.767
Oh, mate...

25:38.700 --> 25:40.767
Now that I pecked that boy
last night,

25:40.833 --> 25:43.167
bring on work,
and bring on single Nathan.

25:48.700 --> 25:50.900
Got your Scotty T's on? (laughs)

25:51.733 --> 25:53.200
Come on, come on.

25:53.267 --> 25:54.600
Bye.
Bye!

25:54.667 --> 25:57.233
Come on, let's go. Work time.
Shut up, man.

25:57.300 --> 25:59.000
All set, mate, let's go.

26:00.400 --> 26:02.867
It's like a house, isn't it?
A house on wheels.

26:07.633 --> 26:11.467
So, Anna has got six people at
Jalou,

26:11.533 --> 26:15.233
you're gonna get them on the
bus,
keep 'em entertained, play
games.

26:15.300 --> 26:19.167
The main thing is making sure
the clients have the best time.

26:19.233 --> 26:21.667
Cos at the end of the day,
it's their job.

26:21.733 --> 26:23.367
Don't like it? Fuck off!

26:23.433 --> 26:25.433
What's the craic with work,
Scott?

26:25.500 --> 26:28.067
Keep them happy,
that's the main thing.

26:28.133 --> 26:30.800
There's gonna be cake, balloons,
drink...

26:30.867 --> 26:32.567
(cheering)

26:35.467 --> 26:36.733
Howay, let's go!

26:36.800 --> 26:40.333
Now I'm confident these
dickheads
know what they're doing,

26:40.400 --> 26:43.667
that means my job is done,
so now I'm fucking doing one.

26:43.733 --> 26:44.867
And he's off!

26:44.933 --> 26:47.100
It's a good job
that Scott has fucked off,

26:47.167 --> 26:50.700
because it looks like
the party crew of six has
arrived!

26:50.767 --> 26:53.667
Right, youse!
Happy Birthday, Kieran and
Rhiannon!

26:53.733 --> 26:56.167
(all cheer)

26:56.233 --> 26:59.500
I cannot believe
we're having a party on a bus.

26:59.567 --> 27:01.033
We are fucking legends.

27:01.100 --> 27:03.267
(cheering)

27:07.667 --> 27:09.000
Bring on the party games!

27:11.000 --> 27:14.767
The best way to get this party
started is suck and blow.

27:14.833 --> 27:17.633
And that can only lead
to one thing: necking on.

27:19.467 --> 27:21.700
This is absolutely hilarious.

27:22.667 --> 27:24.000
Don't leave me hanging!

27:24.067 --> 27:26.067
I've necked on with not one...

27:28.100 --> 27:29.133
...not two...

27:31.233 --> 27:33.033
(shouting)

27:34.933 --> 27:38.167
...but three, yes three,
semi-fit lads.

27:38.233 --> 27:42.400
(cheering)

27:42.467 --> 27:44.400
This is the best day I've had
at work.

27:47.400 --> 27:49.300
Don't leave me hanging.

27:49.367 --> 27:52.033
I want everyone
to have as much fun as me,

27:52.100 --> 27:53.833
especially the newbies.

27:53.900 --> 27:56.333
Obviously,
I've necked on with three boys.

27:56.400 --> 27:58.467
So, what I want
to see right now is...

27:58.533 --> 28:00.867
Tahlia and Beau, neck on.

28:00.933 --> 28:05.000
Nathan is pure radge. Why's he
just
dared Beau and Tahlia to neck
on?

28:05.067 --> 28:08.133
He's kind of getting with
Bethan!
What the hell, Nathan?

28:09.233 --> 28:12.467
Oh, seriously...
(chanting)

28:12.533 --> 28:16.133
I didn't realise
we were meant to kiss each
other.

28:16.200 --> 28:17.867
Don't want to let the team down.

28:17.933 --> 28:20.300
(chanting) Beau, Beau, Beau!

28:20.367 --> 28:22.667
Fuck it, go on.

28:24.067 --> 28:26.967
Go on.
It's Tash On Tours, after all.

28:27.033 --> 28:28.867
(laughs)
(cheering)

28:30.100 --> 28:33.833
What the fuck is Beau doing?
I'm actually raging. Pissed off.

28:34.733 --> 28:37.267
I'm sat here.
No-one's mugging my friend off.

28:37.333 --> 28:40.800
I don't know why Chloe's so
upset.
I was doing what I was told.

28:40.867 --> 28:42.167
It's just work.

28:42.233 --> 28:44.500
Anyway... Anyway.
Like, howay.

28:44.567 --> 28:46.067
'This is a nightmare.'

28:46.133 --> 28:48.700
Chloe's pissed off
because Bethan likes Beau.

28:48.767 --> 28:51.233
I thought this was
what we were supposed to do?

28:51.300 --> 28:55.167
It's been nice to get to know
youse,
I hope you've had a great
birthday.

28:55.233 --> 28:57.800
Off you get, go on!
Have a good one!

28:57.867 --> 28:59.300
Bye, party people!

28:59.367 --> 29:02.000
You should've said no.
You made me get with boys.

29:02.067 --> 29:04.000
What the fuck is Chloe upset
for?

29:04.067 --> 29:07.633
She should know, work is work.
Tahlia and Beau are single.

29:07.700 --> 29:12.400
I feel awkward, cos now I'm in
the middle and look like a
bitch.

29:12.467 --> 29:14.700
I'm just trying to fit in, you
know?

29:14.767 --> 29:17.500
I shouldn't have to worry
about what I'm doing.

29:18.267 --> 29:19.567
(sobs)

29:22.567 --> 29:25.500
It doesn't matter about Beau
kissing another girl,

29:25.567 --> 29:29.100
but when he kissed someone
in the house, it's so much
worse.

29:29.167 --> 29:31.600
I have been in that position.
It's not nice.

29:31.667 --> 29:33.600
I'm so in the middle of
everything.

29:33.667 --> 29:36.367
But you di... this isn't your
fault.

29:36.433 --> 29:38.467
But that's the way
she's gonna see it,

29:38.533 --> 29:40.667
cos girls always
blame the other girl.

29:40.733 --> 29:44.567
It's not fair now, cos I know
she's
just gonna scream at me about
it.

29:44.633 --> 29:46.367
And it's not my fault.

29:46.433 --> 29:49.300
But it's not you,
he has pissed us off.

29:49.367 --> 29:52.433
I only pecked her. Did you see?
I didn't put a tongue in.

29:52.500 --> 29:54.900
I dunno...
I dunno what's gonna happen.

29:54.967 --> 29:59.700
I dunno what to do. Do I let him
tell Bethan, or do I tell
Bethan?

30:01.833 --> 30:03.767
Cos I know Bethan does like
Beau.

30:05.133 --> 30:09.000
Let's go inside. I wouldn't
worry
about it, cos it's not your
fault.

30:09.067 --> 30:11.500
I am dreading
getting back to that house.

30:11.567 --> 30:13.633
I hope Bethan doesn't find out.

30:18.200 --> 30:20.267
(all) Hey!

30:20.333 --> 30:22.433
Chloe and Tahlia
have just barged in,

30:22.500 --> 30:24.800
and their faces look like
smacked arses.

30:24.867 --> 30:26.133
Oi-oi!

30:26.200 --> 30:27.400
Come on, tell me all.

30:27.467 --> 30:29.233
That was the best ever.

30:29.300 --> 30:31.967
Nathan necked on with three
boys.
Nathan!

30:32.033 --> 30:34.133
Bethan, can I speak upstairs?
Yeah.

30:36.933 --> 30:39.900
Surprise. Chloe's taken
Bethan straight to the room.

30:39.967 --> 30:42.733
Beau, did you kiss anyone?
He kissed Tahlia.

30:42.800 --> 30:45.400
It was a peck though,
it wasn't anything more.

30:45.467 --> 30:50.467
When you go to work, sometimes
you've gotta impress the guest.

30:51.433 --> 30:52.967
Obviously, today at work,

30:53.033 --> 30:55.433
Beau was playing the games,
which was work.

30:55.500 --> 30:59.400
But last minute, Nathan was
like,
"I dare you to kiss Tahlia."

30:59.467 --> 31:01.667
Like, necked on with her?
It was like...

31:02.367 --> 31:03.600
Right, OK.

31:03.667 --> 31:07.567
It was obvious me and Beau had
chemistry, and he's kissed
Tahlia.

31:07.633 --> 31:10.767
I thought he wasn't a fuckboy,
but now I'm not too sure.

31:10.833 --> 31:14.900
He does nice things, and then
he goes and fucks hisself up.

31:14.967 --> 31:17.467
(sighs)
What's gonna happen when we go
out?

31:19.600 --> 31:22.267
It's so good,
having my girl Abbie here.

31:22.333 --> 31:23.600
It's all kicking off.

31:23.667 --> 31:25.900
Do you fancy him?
Who're you shouting at?!

31:25.967 --> 31:27.967
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

31:30.967 --> 31:31.167
.

31:33.700 --> 31:33.900
.

31:45.467 --> 31:48.433
I've got back from work,
and I am shitfaced.

31:48.500 --> 31:50.000
I can barely stand up.

31:54.133 --> 31:57.633
There's not one bit of me mad at
Tahlia for tashing on at work.

31:57.700 --> 32:00.233
Hopefully,
Beau will explain what happened.

32:00.300 --> 32:02.700
Until then, I'm gonna play it
cool.

32:02.767 --> 32:06.133
You lot take so long to get
ready.
I've gotta hoy my jeans on.

32:06.200 --> 32:09.633
I bet it's good, like, for boys
that just have to put clothes
on.

32:09.700 --> 32:11.167
Good for boys and dykes.

32:12.100 --> 32:15.700
I was so nervous for Chloe
telling
Bethan about what happened.

32:15.767 --> 32:19.933
By the looks of it, she doesn't
seem like she blames me. Thank
God.

32:20.000 --> 32:23.133
What's it like being in
the girls' room, getting ready?

32:23.200 --> 32:24.200
Happy as Larry.

32:24.267 --> 32:27.000
I'm getting ready in the girls'
room
for a change,

32:27.067 --> 32:29.633
so I'm gonna let them
dress me up as a girl.

32:29.700 --> 32:31.833
Natalie,
you need your eyebrows done.

32:31.900 --> 32:34.033
No, I don't. I like 'em.

32:34.100 --> 32:38.867
I know that I'm gonna end up
looking
like something out of White
Chicks.

32:38.933 --> 32:40.733
Wait, wait, turn around...

32:41.733 --> 32:42.933
I know!

32:43.000 --> 32:46.367
Chloe! Chloe! She looks like
you!
What, that bad?

32:46.433 --> 32:50.067
It's amazing what a pair of
eyelashes can do, and a blonde
wig.

32:50.133 --> 32:52.333
Introducing... Natalina!

32:52.400 --> 32:53.933
No!

32:54.000 --> 32:55.533
No, man!

32:55.600 --> 32:57.400
Well, you look fucking stunning.

32:57.467 --> 32:59.167
I think you should keep it on.

32:59.233 --> 33:03.233
Oh, please! Please!
Natalie, come on!

33:03.300 --> 33:04.667
I feel like a right twat.

33:04.733 --> 33:07.267
Get this shit off my face!

33:07.333 --> 33:10.633
I just wasted all that makeup
on you, don't ask us again.

33:10.700 --> 33:13.400
I have spent hours
doing this portrait,

33:13.467 --> 33:16.133
and she's not going out like
this?
I'm fuming.

33:25.433 --> 33:27.100
Chloe, lasses.

33:27.167 --> 33:28.400
Hey-hey!

33:28.467 --> 33:31.667
Everyone is looking mint,
and we're buzzing for tonight.

33:36.700 --> 33:38.033
(gasping)
What?

33:38.100 --> 33:39.367
Oh, my God!

33:39.433 --> 33:42.633
Sophie got emotional
saying bye to her boyfriend.

33:42.700 --> 33:45.867
I've organised a surprise
that'll hopefully cheer her up.

33:45.933 --> 33:47.600
To the surprise!

33:48.700 --> 33:50.433
Right, let's go, come on.

33:50.500 --> 33:55.167
Knowing how drunk Nathan is,
I can't imagine this to be good.

33:56.333 --> 33:59.500
(shouts)
Chloe and Bethan are pissed off.

33:59.567 --> 34:02.433
'I'm not gonna let that
ruin my night.'

34:07.033 --> 34:10.266
'We've just arrived at the club,
and it is bouncing.'

34:10.333 --> 34:12.933
What're we waiting for?
Let's get mortal!

34:23.733 --> 34:27.100
Last night, Chloe said
I don't give her enough
attention.

34:27.167 --> 34:29.367
I'm gonna give her
that much attention,

34:29.433 --> 34:31.533
she won't know what to do with
it.

34:37.467 --> 34:39.933
(whoops)

34:42.067 --> 34:44.933
I don't owe Bethan an apology,
I'm not in the wrong.

34:45.000 --> 34:46.967
But I need to explain myself.

34:57.132 --> 35:00.667
I get where Beau's coming from,
but he's giving us mixed
signals.

35:00.733 --> 35:03.433
If he wants to get with me,
he's got making up to do.

35:12.533 --> 35:15.767
I do like Bethan, I'm glad she
understands what happened.

35:15.833 --> 35:18.067
She's making me work hard
for attention.

35:22.533 --> 35:24.833
It's obvious Beau is
back grafting Bethan,

35:24.900 --> 35:28.133
but after what I've seen today,
she needs to be careful.

35:38.200 --> 35:39.900
Tonight is class.

35:39.967 --> 35:43.333
Everyone's smashed,
and the newbies are doing us
proud.

35:43.400 --> 35:46.200
There's only one thing missing,
the surprise,

35:46.267 --> 35:48.333
and Sophie is gonna love it.

35:50.500 --> 35:54.133
(cheering)

35:55.833 --> 35:57.467
Oh, my God, it's Abbie!

35:57.533 --> 36:00.600
I've missed her so much
since she hasn't been in the
house.

36:02.200 --> 36:04.133
I have missed Nathan and Sophie,

36:04.200 --> 36:07.367
and by their reaction,
they've missed me, too.

36:11.033 --> 36:12.600
Hi! Hi!

36:13.567 --> 36:17.567
I'm meeting the new members,
and one that has caught my eye.

36:17.633 --> 36:19.067
He is a bit of me.

36:37.000 --> 36:39.033
It's so good having Abbie here.

36:39.100 --> 36:42.333
Me and Sophie need to fill her
in
on everything.

36:46.767 --> 36:49.400
Nathan has necked on
with three lads today?

36:49.467 --> 36:53.633
I'm so pleased to see that
Nathan
seems to be moving on from his
ex.

37:08.333 --> 37:12.000
It must be hard for Sophie
in the house without her
boyfriend.

37:12.067 --> 37:15.333
I hope I've come in at the
perfect
time so I can cheer her up.

37:28.333 --> 37:31.733
'Sam's finally taking on board
everything I've been saying.'

37:31.800 --> 37:34.567
At this rate, we're gonna be
shagging on the floor!

37:48.500 --> 37:53.267
Nathan is already dragging me
over to Beau. I'm not
complaining.

37:56.700 --> 37:58.167
Abbie clearly likes Beau,

37:58.233 --> 38:01.267
and I don't know what's going on
between him and Bethan.

38:01.333 --> 38:03.633
If I can get her
a cheeky neck-on tonight,

38:03.700 --> 38:05.733
well, that's what friends are
for.

38:13.200 --> 38:16.333
It's great getting to know
Abbie.
She seems really sound.

38:21.167 --> 38:25.500
Beau is on one tonight.
The boy is smashed.

38:25.567 --> 38:27.700
We'll be able to have some fun
with him.

38:32.667 --> 38:36.267
The last thing I want is for
my friend to get mugged off
again.

38:36.333 --> 38:38.467
Beau should not be dancing
with Abbie.

38:42.733 --> 38:44.300
Abbie's single, Beau is.

38:44.367 --> 38:48.000
Beau's good-looking,
Abbie's good-looking. Duh.

38:48.067 --> 38:49.967
(cheering)

38:52.267 --> 38:53.833
I'm mortal, so why not?

38:56.733 --> 38:58.167
Eh? What is Beau doing?

38:58.233 --> 39:01.567
A minute ago, he was making up
excuses for necking with Tahlia.

39:01.633 --> 39:03.433
Now he's necking on with Abbie.

39:11.633 --> 39:13.667
Shit. What have I done, man?

39:17.667 --> 39:22.000
Last night, Beau literally told
us
he liked us. What is he playing
at?

39:24.267 --> 39:28.233
Why is Chloe and Bethan fuming?
Have I done something?

39:34.900 --> 39:37.367
If you think about it,
Beau is single,

39:37.433 --> 39:39.533
and he's got no ties to anyone.

39:39.600 --> 39:42.133
So he technically
can do what he wants.

39:45.067 --> 39:46.900
No-one messes with my best
friend.

39:46.967 --> 39:50.133
Beau is about to meet Psycho
Chloe.

39:55.133 --> 39:58.867
I'm used to seeing Chloe kick
off,
but she needs to practice her
aim.

39:58.933 --> 40:02.767
Some of that drink has gone on
me,
and now my tan's gonna run.

40:09.800 --> 40:11.533
How has this even become a
thing?

40:11.600 --> 40:15.867
Beau and Bethan have known each
other for two days. Two days!

40:15.933 --> 40:17.733
Am I the only one seeing this?

40:20.767 --> 40:24.167
It's all kicking off, and as
much as
I'd love to stay with Abbie,

40:24.233 --> 40:26.867
we need to get this lot
back to the house.

40:27.800 --> 40:30.867
As much as I would love
to go back with the others,

40:30.933 --> 40:33.733
I've caused enough drama
for one night.

40:41.000 --> 40:43.633
Well...
I am not looking forward to
this.

40:43.700 --> 40:46.900
We're back at the house,
and I just know it's gonna kick
off.

40:50.400 --> 40:53.967
I wanna know what the fuck that
conversation was me and you had.

40:54.033 --> 40:58.300
You said, "Bethan, I like you."
But you know when I turned
around?

40:58.367 --> 40:59.733
You were necking on.

40:59.800 --> 41:02.433
I feel like Beau
is trying to lead me on.

41:02.500 --> 41:04.600
He's grafting us,
but keeps fucking up.

41:04.667 --> 41:07.533
(Sophie) None of youse
are doing anything wrong.

41:07.600 --> 41:10.733
'Why do Sophie and Nathan
not understand why we are mad?'

41:10.800 --> 41:13.900
Telling Bethan he likes her,
then doing the opposite.

41:13.967 --> 41:15.333
Why would I not be angry?

41:15.400 --> 41:17.633
It's fine.
How is it fine?

41:17.700 --> 41:19.967
He's done nothing wrong,
he's single.

41:20.033 --> 41:23.067
But he's turned around,
saying one thing to me...

41:23.133 --> 41:26.000
...and he's saying another thing
with another bird!

41:26.067 --> 41:28.967
He's a single boy,
she's a single girl.

41:29.033 --> 41:31.467
I can't believe I've caused all
this.

41:31.533 --> 41:34.033
You're only say that
cos you fucking fancy him!

41:34.100 --> 41:36.100
Who're you shouting at?!

41:36.167 --> 41:38.800
Is this not the same situation
you went through?

41:38.867 --> 41:41.300
I hate it when
Chloe and Nathan argue.

41:41.367 --> 41:43.733
This needs to calm down, now.

41:43.800 --> 41:47.233
Yeah, it is!
The reason it's different...

41:47.300 --> 41:50.733
And I was there for you every
day.
Every day.

41:50.800 --> 41:55.133
I'm not letting what happened to
you
happen to another girl.

41:55.200 --> 41:59.267
We have been friends for a long
time. He's choosing him over me?

41:59.333 --> 42:02.000
You and me have been friends
since day one!

42:02.067 --> 42:04.967
Exactly, so you should listen
to what I say.

42:05.033 --> 42:08.433
Fuck off, man. No, because
you know what I'm saying.

42:08.500 --> 42:12.033
You know what I'm saying.
Sam, you know what I'm saying.

42:12.100 --> 42:14.267
Hey, I'll tell you something
now.

42:14.333 --> 42:18.367
Selfish people live longer.
That's a fact.

42:27.933 --> 42:30.333
I don't know how,
I was pure akka before,

42:30.400 --> 42:34.100
but Sam has managed to calm me
down
and got us into bed.

42:38.300 --> 42:39.467
Oh, yeah.

42:40.667 --> 42:43.100
Today has just been
one big disaster.

42:46.733 --> 42:49.233
I've got pissed at work,
Tahlia's cried,

42:49.300 --> 42:52.167
Beau's necked on with Tahlia,
then with Abbie,

42:52.233 --> 42:54.433
Abbie got swilled by Chloe,
so did Beau.

42:54.500 --> 42:56.167
Now me and Chloe are arguing.

42:56.233 --> 42:58.733
'Surely, you can't get any worse
than that.'

42:58.800 --> 43:01.533
(squeaking)

43:03.867 --> 43:05.233
Fucking brilliant.

43:09.433 --> 43:12.400
Hey!
It's so nice to see Adam.

43:12.467 --> 43:14.233
You're a big fucker!

43:14.300 --> 43:17.100
Mate...
Woof, woof, you divvies.

43:17.800 --> 43:20.133
Why don't we have pre-drinks
at my house?

43:20.200 --> 43:23.400
(cheering)
Chloe's not inviting me to
drinks?

43:26.667 --> 43:29.067
I am having the best time
of my life.

43:30.067 --> 43:31.467
What the fuck?

43:33.933 --> 43:36.167
Bethan is making me work for
this.

43:36.233 --> 43:40.267
Oh, my God. What is happening?

44:07.467 --> 44:07.667
.
