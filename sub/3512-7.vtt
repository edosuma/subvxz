00:02.000 --> 00:03.067
(Grunts)

00:04.701 --> 00:07.137
Aah! (Glass shatters)

00:12.009 --> 00:13.075
(Whack) Aah!

00:17.480 --> 00:21.283
(Sirens wailing in distance)

00:23.320 --> 00:25.720
(Scrubbing)

00:27.857 --> 00:31.292
(Gun cocks) On the ground! Now!

00:31.327 --> 00:34.429
(Police radio chatter)

00:34.464 --> 00:36.932
(Door creaks) Frank?

00:38.568 --> 00:39.601
Frank?

00:39.635 --> 00:40.969
Take a seat, son.

00:41.003 --> 00:43.304
(Gavel bangs) (Man) Please rise.

00:43.339 --> 00:46.273
Frank Henson, 15 years
ago, you were convicted.

00:46.307 --> 00:48.876
By the commonwealth of Pennsylvania.

00:48.910 --> 00:52.012
For the 1998 murder of Kimberly Tolbert.

00:52.046 --> 00:53.681
You were sentenced to death.

00:53.715 --> 00:56.283
This court has found insufficient evidence.

00:56.317 --> 00:57.818
To grant an emergency stay.

00:57.853 --> 01:01.388
Thus, your execution will
proceed as scheduled.

01:01.422 --> 01:04.858
At midnight three days from today.

01:04.891 --> 01:06.626
Court is adjourned.

01:12.600 --> 01:14.968
John... I am so sorry.

01:15.002 --> 01:17.403
Thank you, Professor. You
folks did everything you could.

01:17.437 --> 01:18.871
I know my brother appreciates it.

01:22.208 --> 01:24.209
Frank... (Handcuffs click)

01:24.243 --> 01:25.844
This can't be it. There's
got to be something more.

01:25.879 --> 01:27.145
We can do. What about the lab work.

01:27.179 --> 01:29.180
We were gonna test again, or what about...

01:29.215 --> 01:31.249
Alexis, we've played every card.

01:31.283 --> 01:34.351
Sometimes the good guys don't win.

01:41.126 --> 01:44.261
(Castle) I am not giving up.

01:44.295 --> 01:47.197
And you know why? Because
it's the best idea ever.

01:47.232 --> 01:50.901
Castle, I am not getting married in space.

01:50.935 --> 01:52.669
Why not? We could be the first.

01:52.703 --> 01:54.404
Commercial space flight is
only a couple years away,

01:54.438 --> 01:57.774
and you said you wanted it to be special.

01:57.808 --> 01:59.108
Yes, because when I was a little girl,

01:59.143 --> 02:02.211
imagining my wedding day being
stuck in a small tin can.

02:02.246 --> 02:03.780
With a thousand tons of rocket fuel.

02:03.814 --> 02:05.915
Strapped to my ass was
exactly what I had in mind.

02:05.949 --> 02:07.382
Then we agree.

02:07.417 --> 02:09.351
If you don't wanna go and look
at wedding venues this weekend,

02:09.384 --> 02:11.353
then just say so.

02:11.387 --> 02:13.622
I don't wanna go look at
wedding venues this weekend.

02:13.657 --> 02:16.025
Too bad. (Cell phone chimes)

02:16.059 --> 02:17.960
(Beep)

02:17.994 --> 02:19.562
- What?
- Nothing.

02:19.596 --> 02:21.296
It's, um, text alert on the project

02:21.330 --> 02:22.564
Alexis has been working on.

02:22.598 --> 02:24.732
- I thought you guys weren't talking.
- We're not.

02:24.767 --> 02:27.602
Rather... she isn't. So
I insulted her boyfriend.

02:27.636 --> 02:29.804
What's the prison sentence on that?

02:29.838 --> 02:31.272
Oh, Castle, just give her some time.

02:31.306 --> 02:33.274
She'll get over it. That's what you think.

02:33.308 --> 02:35.076
Once when she was 3, I
refused to buy her a candy bar.

02:35.110 --> 02:37.411
She held her breath until she passed out.

02:37.446 --> 02:41.615
You have no idea how determined she can be.

02:41.649 --> 02:43.216
Alexis, we went through the
case files like you asked.

02:43.250 --> 02:44.751
I gotta say, there's
nothing in there that says.

02:44.786 --> 02:46.152
This guy's innocent.

02:46.187 --> 02:47.487
What about the swabs from
Kim Tolbert's body.

02:47.521 --> 02:49.422
That we submitted to
the New York trace lab.

02:49.457 --> 02:51.257
For re-testing? I mean, they've
had them for weeks.

02:51.292 --> 02:53.893
Well, we've been calling every
day to move things along,

02:53.927 --> 02:56.161
but it's not in our jurisdiction.

02:56.196 --> 02:57.262
You don't understand.

02:57.297 --> 02:58.898
A man's going to die in three days.

02:58.932 --> 03:00.232
Unless we do something.

03:00.266 --> 03:03.502
Oh, we do understand.
There's just not much that we can do.

03:03.536 --> 03:05.004
What about your dad?

03:05.038 --> 03:06.305
Have you talked to him about this case?

03:06.339 --> 03:09.041
Yeah, maybe he'll spot something
that no one else did.

03:18.350 --> 03:20.518
(Door opens)

03:20.552 --> 03:22.587
(Pencils clatter) Whoa.

03:22.622 --> 03:24.188
Hey.

03:24.223 --> 03:25.723
Hey.

03:25.757 --> 03:27.457
So...

03:27.492 --> 03:29.727
You're here.

03:32.597 --> 03:33.864
I need your help.

03:33.898 --> 03:35.933
But just because I'm asking.

03:35.967 --> 03:38.035
Doesn't mean things are okay between us.

03:38.069 --> 03:39.703
I'm still mad at you, okay?

03:39.738 --> 03:41.371
Okay.

03:41.405 --> 03:44.273
What's up?

03:44.307 --> 03:46.075
I've been working on this
innocence review case.

03:46.110 --> 03:47.350
With my criminal law Professor.

03:47.377 --> 03:49.812
This guy is on death row
for killing his neighbor...

03:49.847 --> 03:51.514
A high school girl... But he didn't do it,

03:51.548 --> 03:53.149
and they're about to execute him for it.

03:53.183 --> 03:54.951
How do you know he didn't do it?

03:54.985 --> 03:56.085
Well, for one thing,

03:56.120 --> 03:57.386
he had rotator cuff
surgery four months before.

03:57.420 --> 03:58.620
He couldn't have swung the fireplace poker.

03:58.655 --> 03:59.821
Used to kill the victim.

03:59.856 --> 04:01.322
Well, under the rush of adrenaline,

04:01.357 --> 04:03.258
you'd be surprised what
people are capable of.

04:03.292 --> 04:04.826
You sound just like the prosecutor.

04:04.861 --> 04:07.062
But there's more.

04:07.096 --> 04:08.830
They found fresh tire tracks in the dirt.

04:08.865 --> 04:10.298
Outside the victim's back door...

04:10.332 --> 04:11.299
Bicycle treads.

04:11.333 --> 04:13.135
And Frank didn't own a bike.

04:13.169 --> 04:16.536
No, he was 24 then. He worked on... cars.

04:16.571 --> 04:18.305
Wait.

04:18.339 --> 04:19.540
How do you know his name?

04:19.574 --> 04:21.308
You just said it.

04:21.341 --> 04:23.210
No. I didn't.

04:23.244 --> 04:25.579
You know about the case.

04:25.613 --> 04:26.647
How?

04:26.682 --> 04:28.983
Yeah... how?

04:29.017 --> 04:32.185
I must have seen the
file on Esposito's desk.

04:32.219 --> 04:33.519
You've been checking up on me.

04:33.554 --> 04:34.587
No! No.

04:34.621 --> 04:36.723
Well, a little, yes.

04:36.757 --> 04:38.725
- You're unbelievable.
- Couldn't help it.

04:38.759 --> 04:40.694
You're my daughter. I'm
interested in your life,

04:40.728 --> 04:42.062
but you won't return my calls.

04:42.096 --> 04:44.230
Okay, so did you find anything in the file?

04:44.264 --> 04:45.964
Anything that can help?

04:45.999 --> 04:47.933
Alexis, he did have priors.

04:47.967 --> 04:50.669
What makes you think he's innocent?

04:50.704 --> 04:52.204
Because I know him, dad.

04:52.238 --> 04:55.040
I've spent time with
him. He's not a killer.

04:55.075 --> 04:58.343
I know what the evidence
says, but he didn't do this.

04:58.377 --> 05:00.946
I need you to come to Pennsylvania with me.

05:00.980 --> 05:04.015
I need you to help me prove it.

05:07.119 --> 05:08.285
No, come on. I get it.

05:08.320 --> 05:09.754
(Castle) It would only
be for a couple of days,

05:09.788 --> 05:11.522
'cause that's pretty much
all the time there is left,

05:11.556 --> 05:13.390
and it's a chance for
Alexis and me to reconnect.

05:13.425 --> 05:14.892
Castle, you don't have to explain.

05:14.927 --> 05:16.961
We can look at venues another day.

05:16.995 --> 05:18.795
- You sure you're all right with this?
- Yes.

05:18.830 --> 05:19.863
I mean, she's practically family.

05:19.897 --> 05:21.932
I care about her, too.

05:21.966 --> 05:24.067
You're pretty great, you know that?

05:24.102 --> 05:27.204
Yeah. Now go spend some
time with your daughter.

05:29.874 --> 05:31.241
- Thanks.
- Good luck.

05:31.275 --> 05:34.643
It has been a long time since
we have taken a road trip together.

05:34.677 --> 05:36.779
(Closes trunk) Remember the time
we went to amish country?

05:36.813 --> 05:41.283
Ended up getting
chased by that cow? (Laughs)

05:41.317 --> 05:45.487
Dad, this isn't a road
trip, and this isn't about fun.

05:45.521 --> 05:46.889
This is about having less than 70 hours.

05:46.923 --> 05:48.624
To save a man from execution.

05:48.658 --> 05:49.824
Let's go.

05:49.859 --> 05:51.059
Right.

05:51.093 --> 05:52.794
Fasten your seatbelt. (Seatbelts click)

05:52.828 --> 05:54.629
Gonna be a bumpy ride.

05:54.663 --> 05:55.964
(Starts engine)

05:59.167 --> 06:02.964
<font color="#ffff00">sync and corrections by dreaMaker7

06:10.594 --> 06:12.295
So...

06:12.330 --> 06:14.064
How is, uh...

06:14.098 --> 06:18.201
How is Pi? Everything still good?

06:18.236 --> 06:20.837
Why are you asking about Pi?

06:20.871 --> 06:22.406
I... just thought.

06:22.440 --> 06:24.480
- We should chat about...
- Dad, I know what you're doing.

06:24.508 --> 06:26.409
What am I doing?

06:26.443 --> 06:27.510
You're trying to bond.

06:27.544 --> 06:29.245
No, I'm not. (Chuckles)

06:29.279 --> 06:31.980
Yes, you are. We haven't talked in weeks,

06:32.015 --> 06:34.450
so now you're trying to make this about us.

06:34.484 --> 06:36.218
No, I wasn't.

06:36.253 --> 06:37.719
(Sighs) I wasn't, so...

06:37.754 --> 06:40.388
And what if I was? Would that be so bad?

06:40.423 --> 06:42.024
I just thought you were here for the case.

06:42.058 --> 06:43.525
I am.

06:43.560 --> 06:44.893
Then how come you haven't
asked a single question about it.

06:44.928 --> 06:47.596
Since we left?

06:47.630 --> 06:48.729
Okay.

06:48.764 --> 06:50.898
Um... so what do I need to know?

06:50.933 --> 06:54.769
Frank Henson... the accused.

06:54.803 --> 06:56.771
We're meeting him at the
prison. He's Pennsylvania blue collar,

06:56.805 --> 06:59.140
struggled through high
school, but he's smart.

06:59.175 --> 07:02.610
He earned his
Automotive Mechanic degree in '95.

07:02.644 --> 07:04.311
He's a little rough around the edges,

07:04.345 --> 07:05.446
but he's got a good heart.

07:05.480 --> 07:06.880
- Okay.
- Oh, and...

07:06.914 --> 07:08.215
And there's Maggie. (Photo rustles)

07:08.249 --> 07:09.216
Who's Maggie?

07:09.250 --> 07:11.185
Maggie Ingram, the love of his life.

07:11.219 --> 07:12.386
She'll be at the prison, too.

07:12.420 --> 07:13.620
Love of his life?

07:13.654 --> 07:15.789
Is it one of those
prison pen pal romance things?

07:15.823 --> 07:18.192
Dad, no. She's his high school sweetheart.

07:18.226 --> 07:20.893
He proposed to her two
weeks before his arrest.

07:20.927 --> 07:22.695
And she stayed with him?

07:22.729 --> 07:24.564
She's been by his side the whole time.

07:24.598 --> 07:26.232
Every hearing, every appeal.

07:26.266 --> 07:27.866
She's the one who wrote
to the innocence review.

07:27.901 --> 07:30.470
Every week for three
years to get us involved.

07:30.504 --> 07:33.439
(File rustles)

07:33.474 --> 07:35.241
You know, Alexis, um...

07:36.775 --> 07:39.711
Th-this is a long
shot. You know that, right?

07:39.745 --> 07:43.715
I mean, it may not work
out the way you hope.

07:43.749 --> 07:45.750
I-I just don't wanna...

07:45.784 --> 07:47.619
Just don't wanna see you hurt.

07:47.653 --> 07:49.287
Dad, I know these people.

07:49.322 --> 07:51.289
I care about them.

07:51.324 --> 07:53.857
It already hurts.

07:57.695 --> 07:59.696
(Buzzer)

08:02.534 --> 08:03.834
(Buzzer)

08:03.868 --> 08:06.237
(Man) You're good.

08:06.271 --> 08:07.471
(Door clanks) Alexis.

08:07.506 --> 08:08.739
Thank God. Mm.

08:08.773 --> 08:10.607
Maggie, this is my dad.

08:10.642 --> 08:11.742
Hi.

08:11.776 --> 08:13.409
Mr. Castle, thanks for coming.

08:13.444 --> 08:16.647
I'd almost given up till Alexis called.

08:17.682 --> 08:19.482
Oh.

08:19.517 --> 08:22.352
(Keys jangle)

08:22.386 --> 08:25.087
(Door clanks in distance)

08:28.291 --> 08:32.028
(Handcuffs clattering)

08:32.062 --> 08:33.428
Hey, baby.

08:33.462 --> 08:34.697
Hey, sunshine.

08:34.731 --> 08:37.866
So what is this, a going away party?

08:37.900 --> 08:40.535
- No. They came back to help.
- Help out?

08:40.570 --> 08:42.636
Lost the appeal. It's over, isn't it?

08:42.672 --> 08:45.339
No. It's not over. Not yet.

08:45.374 --> 08:47.976
This is Mr. Castle, Alexis' father.

08:48.010 --> 08:49.010
Hi.

08:49.045 --> 08:50.779
Nice to meet you, Mr. Castle.

08:50.813 --> 08:52.547
(Handcuffs clatter) Your
girl's one in a million.

08:52.581 --> 08:54.883
- You should be proud.
- Oh, I am.

08:54.917 --> 08:56.950
So are you some kind of lawyer?

08:56.985 --> 08:58.052
Oh, no.

08:58.086 --> 09:00.220
- You a cop?
- No.

09:00.254 --> 09:02.990
I'm a... mystery writer.

09:04.325 --> 09:05.525
He's more than that.

09:05.560 --> 09:08.662
He's helped the NYPD crack
their biggest cases.

09:08.697 --> 09:10.530
Well, I don't... I don't wanna oversell it.

09:10.565 --> 09:12.566
You ever save a guy on death row?

09:12.600 --> 09:14.567
No.

09:14.601 --> 09:17.003
But my dad's a genius at
uncovering the real story.

09:17.037 --> 09:18.557
Frank, I know you've been through this.

09:18.572 --> 09:21.941
More times than you can
stomach, but if you can...

09:21.975 --> 09:24.143
Tell him what happened that night.

09:27.414 --> 09:30.182
Frank.

09:30.216 --> 09:34.152
I was working on my Camaro.

09:34.187 --> 09:39.691
I spent every waking
hour with it back then.

09:39.726 --> 09:41.860
<i>My house alarm went off.</i>

09:41.894 --> 09:43.394
(Alarm beeping)

09:43.429 --> 09:44.529
I was doing some welding,

09:44.563 --> 09:46.083
and the smoke set off the garage alarm.

09:46.098 --> 09:48.866
The code is Stingray 7.

09:48.900 --> 09:50.835
(Beeping continues)

09:50.869 --> 09:51.836
(Beeping stops) It's off now.

09:51.870 --> 09:53.137
Thank you.

09:53.171 --> 09:54.504
(Woman screams in
distance) (Telephone beeps)

09:54.539 --> 09:56.841
<i>That's when I heard the
screams across the street.</i>

09:56.875 --> 10:00.310
<i>I ran over to see what happened.</i>

10:00.345 --> 10:01.410
Hello?

10:01.445 --> 10:02.645
(Doorknob rattling)

10:02.679 --> 10:05.681
Is everyone all right?

10:06.817 --> 10:10.653
<i>Back door was open, so I went inside.</i>

10:12.623 --> 10:13.723
<i>She was lying there.</i>

10:16.227 --> 10:17.860
<i>The blood was, uh...</i>

10:17.894 --> 10:19.862
<i>Whatever happened, i was too late.</i>

10:19.896 --> 10:22.297
<i>(Sirens wailing) I heard
the sirens, and I panicked.</i>

10:22.331 --> 10:24.599
<i>I mean, I knew how it
would look, so I took a rag.</i>

10:24.634 --> 10:26.534
<i>And tried to wipe down all my prints,</i>

10:26.569 --> 10:28.670
<i>but I ran out of time.</i>

10:28.704 --> 10:30.773
I had her blood on me, a police record.

10:30.807 --> 10:33.741
It... went the way you'd expect.

10:33.776 --> 10:35.910
And what about your home security company?

10:35.944 --> 10:37.278
Did they have a record of your call?

10:37.312 --> 10:38.612
(Alexis) Yes.

10:38.647 --> 10:40.882
But the prosecution argued it
still left plenty of time.

10:40.916 --> 10:42.549
How well did you know Kim Tolbert?

10:42.584 --> 10:43.751
Not that well.

10:43.786 --> 10:45.286
I mean, her mom and her
lived there a few years,

10:45.320 --> 10:48.122
and... Kim'd flirt with me a little bit.

10:48.157 --> 10:49.322
I was friendly, but that was it.

10:49.356 --> 10:50.957
They entered her diary into record.

10:50.992 --> 10:53.126
She wrote that she had a crush on Frank,

10:53.161 --> 10:55.762
so the prosecutor made Frank out
to be some kind of predator.

10:55.797 --> 10:58.331
And you didn't... see
anyone as you ran into the house?

10:58.365 --> 11:01.802
No. They must have bolted out
the back before I got there.

11:01.836 --> 11:04.171
Well, what about back then?

11:04.205 --> 11:06.305
Anybody she was having a problem with?

11:08.275 --> 11:11.643
Lyle Gomez, Kim's high
school ex-boyfriend.

11:11.678 --> 11:15.147
They had a very... stormy relationship.

11:15.182 --> 11:19.351
Plus she dumped him a
week before she was killed.

11:19.385 --> 11:20.519
Police talk to him?

11:20.553 --> 11:23.321
Well, they didn't have to. They had me.

11:23.355 --> 11:26.490
Mr. Castle, I've got three
days left on God's earth.

11:26.525 --> 11:29.194
I don't need you to find the real killer.

11:29.228 --> 11:32.463
I just need somebody to prove it wasn't me.

11:40.338 --> 11:41.671
Castle, take it easy. Calm down.

11:41.706 --> 11:42.973
(Lowered voice) Calm down?

11:43.007 --> 11:45.843
You should have seen the
way these people looked at me.

11:45.877 --> 11:47.377
Like I'm some kind of savior.

11:47.411 --> 11:49.479
I-I don't even know if he's innocent.

11:49.513 --> 11:50.680
Okay, how can I help?

11:50.715 --> 11:52.115
<i>I don't even know if i can help.</i>

11:52.150 --> 11:56.919
I mean... what if I can't?
Alexis would never forgive me.

11:56.954 --> 12:00.857
Just do your best,
Castle. I mean, she loves you.

12:00.891 --> 12:04.160
And I'm here... For both of you.

12:04.194 --> 12:06.595
She's coming. I gotta
go. (Cell phone beeps)

12:06.629 --> 12:08.231
(Door closes) Hey.

12:08.265 --> 12:09.831
- Ready to get
started? - Uh-huh.

12:09.866 --> 12:11.366
Let's go.

12:13.569 --> 12:14.903
(Cell phone beeps)

12:16.305 --> 12:19.407
(Crickets chirping)

12:19.441 --> 12:21.476
This is everything
spanning the life of the case.

12:21.510 --> 12:23.011
Well, the least your
Professor could've done.

12:23.045 --> 12:24.712
Is throw in some cliffsnotes.

12:24.747 --> 12:27.514
So what do we know about this
ex-boyfriend of Kim's?

12:27.548 --> 12:28.849
Lyle Gomez.

12:28.884 --> 12:30.550
Uh, was a varsity football player.

12:30.585 --> 12:32.186
Hot and cold relationship with Kim.

12:32.220 --> 12:34.288
Everyone that knew
him said he had a temper.

12:34.322 --> 12:35.622
Do you guys talk to him?

12:35.656 --> 12:37.691
Professor McDonald and
the defense lawyer tried,

12:37.725 --> 12:40.627
but Lyle told them he
didn't want to relive it.

12:40.661 --> 12:41.928
Said it was too painful.

12:41.962 --> 12:43.496
And there's no evidence that indicates.

12:43.530 --> 12:46.099
- He might have done it?
Nothing at all? - Mnh-mnh.

12:47.434 --> 12:50.703
What are all these little
things on the floor around the body?

12:50.737 --> 12:53.306
Charms. They broke off her bracelet
during the struggle.

12:53.340 --> 12:54.507
So before the attack,

12:54.541 --> 12:56.575
there might have been some
pushing and shoving.

12:56.610 --> 12:57.842
Lovers' quarrels can start like that.

12:57.877 --> 12:59.238
Before they turn to something else.

12:59.245 --> 13:00.345
But aside from Maggie's theory,

13:00.380 --> 13:02.915
there's nothing tying Lyle to any of this.

13:02.949 --> 13:07.786
But... maybe you'll
see something we missed.

13:07.820 --> 13:10.155
Hey, so that evidence the innocence review.

13:10.189 --> 13:12.791
Submitted to the trace
lab... How close are they.

13:12.825 --> 13:13.991
To looking at it?

13:14.026 --> 13:15.159
Well, from what we
heard, it's gonna take weeks,

13:15.193 --> 13:18.062
which means they'll
never get to it in time.

13:18.096 --> 13:20.398
(Sighs)

13:20.432 --> 13:22.133
(Exhales deeply)

13:22.167 --> 13:24.135
- What?
- Well, by all accounts,

13:24.169 --> 13:26.503
Kim was a bright and beautiful girl.

13:26.538 --> 13:27.571
Who everyone loved.

13:27.605 --> 13:28.739
She had no enemies to speak of,

13:28.773 --> 13:31.841
and nothing points to
anyone other than Frank.

13:31.875 --> 13:33.476
Because they didn't look at
anyone other than Frank.

13:33.510 --> 13:36.712
Or maybe because... It was Frank.

13:38.549 --> 13:40.516
Look, I'm sorry,
Alexis. It's just sometimes...

13:40.551 --> 13:42.585
Okay, fine. But if it was Frank,

13:42.619 --> 13:43.820
<i>what was his motive?</i>

13:43.854 --> 13:45.321
Right.

13:45.355 --> 13:49.658
Wow. You innocence review
folks just won't give up, will you?

13:49.692 --> 13:52.627
Can I help you, officer... "Lane"?

13:52.662 --> 13:54.196
Kim's murder tore this town apart.

13:54.230 --> 13:55.931
I guess, uh,

13:55.966 --> 13:58.667
we're just wondering what
you all are fighting for.

13:58.701 --> 14:00.869
- Justice.
- Justice?

14:00.903 --> 14:03.304
He had her blood on his
hands when they caught him.

14:03.339 --> 14:05.006
He was holding the shop rag.

14:05.040 --> 14:06.807
That he used to wipe down the crime scene.

14:06.842 --> 14:09.910
You want justice? Let him meet his maker.

14:15.150 --> 14:16.851
Has it been like that the whole time?

14:16.885 --> 14:18.018
Pretty much.

14:20.521 --> 14:22.722
Okay, let's go over this again.

14:22.756 --> 14:25.692
Frank hears a scream.
He runs across the way.

14:25.726 --> 14:27.294
He bangs on the door. It's locked.

14:27.328 --> 14:30.330
- He runs around the back.
- He finds the back door open and goes inside.

14:30.365 --> 14:33.165
Back door was open. Wait.

14:33.200 --> 14:34.666
(Cell phone beeps)

14:34.701 --> 14:37.003
What time of year was
the murder... November?

14:37.037 --> 14:38.871
Yeah, the 13th. Why?

14:38.905 --> 14:43.009
1998. Temperature that night was...

14:43.043 --> 14:44.410
40 degrees.

14:44.444 --> 14:45.978
So?

14:46.013 --> 14:48.180
So that's far too cold for
Kim to have left the door open.

14:48.215 --> 14:49.881
Yet according to Frank, it was open,

14:49.915 --> 14:52.217
presumably because someone
else committed the crime.

14:52.251 --> 14:54.185
Yeah, but everyone thinks he's lying.

14:54.220 --> 14:56.021
Yes, but what they don't see,

14:56.055 --> 14:57.989
what no one sees.

14:58.024 --> 15:01.159
Is that we can prove whether
or not he was lying.

15:01.193 --> 15:03.561
Come on. I'll get the
car. You pay the check.

15:03.595 --> 15:04.996
Wait. Dad?

15:07.132 --> 15:10.434
Come on, dad. Will you
please tell me what you're doing?

15:10.468 --> 15:12.002
If Frank is guilty,

15:12.037 --> 15:16.106
then he would have opened
the back door, which means...

15:16.141 --> 15:17.107
He would have wiped down the doorknob.

15:17.142 --> 15:18.708
To get rid of his fingerprints.

15:18.743 --> 15:20.911
(Files rustling) But if he's
telling the truth and the back door.

15:20.945 --> 15:22.545
<i>Was already open, he
wouldn't have needed to wipe it.</i>

15:22.579 --> 15:24.013
Because he never touched it.

15:24.048 --> 15:25.781
And that would mean someone
else was there that night.

15:25.815 --> 15:27.583
Question is, did CSU

15:27.617 --> 15:30.353
dust that doorknob for fingerprints?

15:30.387 --> 15:31.554
Here it is.

15:31.588 --> 15:33.356
- They did.
- And?

15:33.390 --> 15:36.625
(Closes file) And... it was wiped clean.

15:36.660 --> 15:38.760
Sorry, sweetie. He lied.

15:40.096 --> 15:42.531
- But it doesn't make any sense.
- I know.

15:42.565 --> 15:43.865
I wanted to believe it as much as you.

15:43.899 --> 15:45.700
No, I mean this report.

15:45.734 --> 15:48.170
It says the back
doorknob was totally clean...

15:48.204 --> 15:49.404
No prints, no nothing.

15:49.439 --> 15:51.806
So Frank couldn't have wiped it down.

15:51.840 --> 15:53.600
The shop rag Frank
used was covered in grease.

15:53.608 --> 15:55.543
From working on his car. They
found traces of grease.

15:55.577 --> 15:58.145
In other places where he
wiped down his prints,

15:58.180 --> 16:00.081
but there's no mention
of it on the doorknob.

16:00.115 --> 16:02.116
It isn't in the report.

16:02.150 --> 16:03.650
Dad, if there wasn't any grease...

16:03.685 --> 16:05.386
Then someone else was there,

16:05.420 --> 16:06.954
wiped down the
doorknob before Frank got there,

16:06.988 --> 16:09.589
getting rid of their own prints.

16:09.623 --> 16:10.823
<i>Someone else was there that night.</i>

16:10.857 --> 16:13.426
Sweetie, you were right.

16:13.461 --> 16:15.395
Someone else killed Kim Tolbert.

16:21.433 --> 16:23.000
Yes, Professor, I understand.

16:23.034 --> 16:24.702
Okay. Bye.

16:24.736 --> 16:25.936
(Cell phone beeps)

16:27.070 --> 16:29.272
- What'd he say?
- It's not enough.

16:29.307 --> 16:31.740
But we know someone
else wiped down the doorknob.

16:31.775 --> 16:33.008
Yeah. But he says you can't build a case.

16:33.042 --> 16:34.310
Based on evidence that isn't there.

16:34.344 --> 16:36.645
(Cell phone rings)

16:36.680 --> 16:37.846
It's Beckett. (Cell phone beeps)

16:37.880 --> 16:38.947
Hey.

16:38.981 --> 16:40.081
Hey, how's it going?

16:40.116 --> 16:41.750
I... (Stammers) Not... not so good.

16:41.785 --> 16:44.486
We'd be grasping at straws if we had any.

16:44.521 --> 16:46.087
Well, I might have one for you.

16:46.122 --> 16:48.323
I went to the trace lab last night.

16:48.357 --> 16:50.692
Their people wouldn't
run your case evidence,

16:50.726 --> 16:52.360
but I found someone else that would.

16:52.394 --> 16:53.461
Who?

16:54.831 --> 16:57.165
It's Lanie. Put me on speaker.

16:57.200 --> 16:59.667
Yeah. Um... you're on.

16:59.702 --> 17:02.003
Alexis, why on earth.

17:02.038 --> 17:03.638
Wouldn't you come to me directly?

17:03.672 --> 17:06.173
- Lanie, I didn't know you could do...
- She convinced

17:06.208 --> 17:08.976
a contact at the lab to
run evidence after hours.

17:09.010 --> 17:11.811
Now we re-tested every swab taken.

17:11.847 --> 17:13.814
From Kim's body 15 years ago.

17:13.848 --> 17:16.282
Everything listed in Pennsylvania's report.

17:16.318 --> 17:17.651
Came out in our report,

17:17.685 --> 17:19.653
with the exception of one thing.

17:19.686 --> 17:22.121
We found trace amounts of ammonium nitrate.

17:22.156 --> 17:24.089
That their lab never picked up.

17:24.124 --> 17:25.157
Ammonium nitrate?

17:25.192 --> 17:27.393
It's an oxidizing agent, commonly found.

17:27.426 --> 17:29.795
In cold packs, uh, explosives,

17:29.830 --> 17:31.564
- fertilizer.
- Fertilizer.

17:31.598 --> 17:32.665
Wait.

17:32.699 --> 17:34.033
Lyle Gomez.

17:34.068 --> 17:38.070
Kim's ex-boyfriend. He used
to work at a gardening store.

17:38.104 --> 17:40.805
Dad, it's him. That's why
he wouldn't speak with us.

17:40.840 --> 17:42.875
- We have to go talk to him.
- Wait a minute.

17:42.909 --> 17:44.142
If you guys think someone
out there is involved,

17:44.177 --> 17:45.744
then you need to get ahold of the police.

17:45.778 --> 17:47.913
Yeah, I don't think the police are gonna be

17:47.947 --> 17:49.581
of much help around here.

17:49.615 --> 17:50.849
Castle, if he's your
killer, he's dangerous.

17:50.884 --> 17:52.917
I can't help you if something happens.

17:52.951 --> 17:56.320
Uh, look, Beckett, Frank
Henson has two days to live.

17:56.355 --> 17:59.891
This is our only lead. What
else are we supposed to do?

18:01.927 --> 18:06.364
<i>Okay. Now odds are, Lyle Gomez will not.</i>

18:06.398 --> 18:07.631
Want to speak with us,

18:07.665 --> 18:10.000
<i>but I've got
experience with guys like this,</i>

18:10.034 --> 18:11.601
so you just leave it to me.

18:11.635 --> 18:13.970
(Alexis) Oh, there he is.

18:23.080 --> 18:24.780
All right, that does not bode well.

18:24.814 --> 18:26.382
(Unbuckles seat belt)

18:26.416 --> 18:27.950
Oh, oh, whoa. Where you think you're going?

18:27.984 --> 18:31.253
- To talk to him.
- Whoa. Alexis, no. Absolutely not.

18:31.288 --> 18:32.955
He just gave us a
none-too-subtle hint.

18:32.989 --> 18:34.156
<i>He was looking at you,
dad. He won't talk to you,</i>

18:34.190 --> 18:35.391
but I can reach him.

18:35.425 --> 18:37.359
The man is a possible murder suspect.

18:37.394 --> 18:38.928
He won't do anything with you here.

18:38.962 --> 18:40.528
But what makes you even think.

18:40.562 --> 18:42.230
He's gonna open the door to you?

18:42.264 --> 18:44.265
I'm a teenage girl. I'll remind him of Kim.

18:44.300 --> 18:47.168
- No, I'm not...
- I'm not asking for permission.

18:50.705 --> 18:52.773
I'll be watching you like a hawk.

18:54.410 --> 18:56.609
(Car door closes)

19:00.014 --> 19:02.215
You people need to stay off my property.

19:02.250 --> 19:04.084
I guess Kim was wrong about you.

19:04.118 --> 19:05.485
What do you mean?

19:05.519 --> 19:06.886
I read her diary.

19:06.921 --> 19:09.289
She said you were kind, caring,

19:09.324 --> 19:10.723
made her feel safe.

19:12.492 --> 19:14.093
What else did she say?

19:14.127 --> 19:16.728
How about you let me in?

19:26.639 --> 19:28.806
(Door closes)

19:28.841 --> 19:33.311
Not a day goes by I don't think about her.

19:33.346 --> 19:36.414
You ever been in love so bad, it hurt?

19:36.449 --> 19:38.183
Is that why you don't talk about it?

19:38.217 --> 19:41.886
Where were you when it happened?

19:43.755 --> 19:45.022
Kim called me that night.

19:45.056 --> 19:47.491
She wanted me to pick
her up from Jasper Grove.

19:47.525 --> 19:48.925
Jasper Grove? What's that?

19:48.960 --> 19:51.795
Farmland and woods, east
of town. Kids party there.

19:51.829 --> 19:53.697
She must have gone to
one, which surprised me.

19:53.731 --> 19:55.499
Because she barely ever drank.

19:55.533 --> 19:57.434
But Kim broke up with you, right?

19:57.469 --> 19:58.969
So why'd she call you?

19:59.004 --> 20:02.271
She said I was the only
one that she could trust.

20:02.306 --> 20:03.439
She was upset.

20:03.474 --> 20:04.540
About what?

20:04.574 --> 20:07.943
She didn't say. I figured
somebody hit on her.

20:07.978 --> 20:10.713
Anyway, she asked me to
drive her home, so I did.

20:10.747 --> 20:11.881
What happened then?

20:11.915 --> 20:13.983
I was hoping that her calling meant.

20:14.018 --> 20:17.019
That she'd give me another chance.

20:17.053 --> 20:19.554
(Inhales deeply) So I asked.

20:19.588 --> 20:21.156
- If I could come in.
- And did you?

20:21.190 --> 20:23.492
She wanted to be alone.

20:23.526 --> 20:26.961
She said she had some
decisions she needed to make.

20:26.996 --> 20:30.499
So I decided I needed to get drunk.

20:30.533 --> 20:33.067
So I went and I shoplifted a pint of Jack,

20:33.101 --> 20:35.002
but the shop owner caught me.

20:35.037 --> 20:36.837
He made me pick up every
single piece of litter.

20:36.871 --> 20:38.906
In his parking lot as punishment.

20:38.940 --> 20:40.341
When I heard the sirens,

20:40.375 --> 20:42.510
I thought he was arresting me, too.

20:42.544 --> 20:44.978
Those sirens were for Kim.

20:45.013 --> 20:48.648
When I got to her house, I saw Frank.

20:48.682 --> 20:51.551
I saw her body on the stretcher.

20:51.585 --> 20:55.688
If I had just found a way to stay there,

20:55.722 --> 20:57.390
she'd be alive.

20:57.425 --> 20:59.725
Did you tell this to the police?

20:59.760 --> 21:01.961
They didn't ask. Why would
they? They had the guy.

21:12.238 --> 21:14.339
Why do you think Frank killed her?

21:14.374 --> 21:15.541
Maybe he got jealous.

21:15.575 --> 21:17.909
He didn't like seeing her with other guys.

21:17.944 --> 21:19.411
What other guys?

21:19.446 --> 21:20.678
I didn't ask.

21:20.712 --> 21:22.746
But I know they dropped by her house.

21:22.781 --> 21:25.015
Other boys.

21:25.050 --> 21:27.718
Thanks.

21:27.752 --> 21:29.387
(Gasps)

21:29.421 --> 21:31.055
(Lowered voice) Dad, what are you doing?!

21:31.090 --> 21:32.056
(Door closes)

21:32.091 --> 21:33.291
I was overreacting, maybe.

21:33.325 --> 21:35.093
You were in there a long time.

21:35.127 --> 21:36.793
And I came away with some leads.

21:36.827 --> 21:38.695
Turns out Kim was seeing other boys.

21:38.729 --> 21:41.565
(Footsteps depart)

21:41.599 --> 21:43.266
(Frank) What other boys?

21:43.301 --> 21:44.701
We were hoping you could tell us.

21:44.735 --> 21:46.303
You lived across the street from her.

21:46.337 --> 21:47.817
Do you remember seeing any other guys.

21:47.838 --> 21:49.272
Go to Kim's house?

21:49.307 --> 21:51.141
That was 15 years ago. This
is important, Frank.

21:51.175 --> 21:52.475
One of them may be involved in her death.

21:52.509 --> 21:54.076
That's the only lead you have?

21:54.111 --> 21:55.077
We're also looking.

21:55.112 --> 21:57.113
Into the party Kim went to that night.

21:57.147 --> 21:58.914
We have NYPD checking, seeing if.

21:58.948 --> 22:00.616
Anything was reported in Jasper Grove.

22:00.650 --> 22:01.817
That could connect to her murder.

22:01.851 --> 22:03.252
Try to focus on kids you
saw at Kim's house.

22:03.286 --> 22:06.555
Anything you can
remember... Hair color, cars they drove,

22:06.590 --> 22:09.591
bikes they rode. Not
just that day. Any day.

22:09.625 --> 22:10.891
Try to think.

22:10.926 --> 22:12.994
I'm tired of thinking.

22:13.028 --> 22:17.064
I'm tired all around,
to tell you the truth.

22:17.099 --> 22:19.066
Frank.

22:19.101 --> 22:20.735
It's over, Alexis.

22:20.769 --> 22:21.869
Don't say that.

22:23.272 --> 22:25.472
All these years...

22:25.507 --> 22:27.407
Maggie has been leading this charge.

22:27.442 --> 22:29.809
She's been my rock,

22:29.844 --> 22:31.945
and now I've gotta be hers.

22:31.979 --> 22:34.114
I've got less than two days.

22:34.149 --> 22:36.683
To help her make peace with
what's about to come.

22:36.717 --> 22:39.085
The last thing that she
needs is more false hope.

22:39.120 --> 22:40.886
<i>- This isn't false hope.
- It is false hope.</i>

22:40.920 --> 22:42.321
- It's done.
- This could be what turns everything around!

22:42.356 --> 22:44.390
It's done. Alexis...

22:46.226 --> 22:49.662
Guard.

22:51.398 --> 22:53.032
Listen, I appreciate
everything you've done,

22:53.066 --> 22:54.867
everything you've tried to do.

22:54.901 --> 22:56.368
(Handcuffs rattle)

22:56.402 --> 22:58.870
But it's time to let it go.

22:58.904 --> 23:01.573
(Handcuffs clattering)

23:15.803 --> 23:17.104
Dad, we might be on to something.

23:17.138 --> 23:18.671
How can Frank just give up?

23:18.706 --> 23:21.140
After what he's been
through, I can't blame him.

23:21.174 --> 23:22.742
So you're giving up, too.

23:22.776 --> 23:25.644
Hey, we are gonna follow
every possible lead, but...

23:25.678 --> 23:27.246
(Dialing cell phone) We
can't go back to Frank,

23:27.280 --> 23:28.781
not until we have solid
evidence that he's innocent. (Line rings)

23:28.815 --> 23:30.116
(Line clicks) (Ryan) Hey, Castle.

23:30.150 --> 23:32.852
Hey, Ryan, did you come up with
anything on Jasper Grove?

23:32.886 --> 23:34.186
No police or incident reports.

23:34.221 --> 23:36.021
From the night that Kim Tolbert died.

23:36.056 --> 23:37.789
However, I did find definite signs.

23:37.823 --> 23:38.990
Of trouble in Jasper Grove.

23:39.024 --> 23:40.291
What kind of trouble?

23:40.325 --> 23:42.526
A farmhouse there was foreclosed on.

23:42.561 --> 23:45.206
In '97, stood empty till '99.

23:45.496 --> 23:46.897
That's when a young family bought it,

23:46.932 --> 23:49.099
but as soon as they moved
in, they all got sick.

23:49.133 --> 23:50.834
Turns out the place was contaminated.

23:50.869 --> 23:51.835
With toxic chemicals.

23:51.870 --> 23:53.003
From what?

23:53.038 --> 23:54.737
Uh, high levels of residue.

23:54.772 --> 23:56.906
From methamphetamine
production, which might explain.

23:56.941 --> 23:58.140
Your ammonium nitrate.

23:58.175 --> 23:59.976
Someone was using the
farmhouse to cook meth?

24:00.010 --> 24:01.143
Yeah, and it looks like.

24:01.178 --> 24:02.178
It might have been kids.

24:02.212 --> 24:03.846
What makes you say that?

24:03.881 --> 24:05.682
Photos from the county assessor's office.

24:05.716 --> 24:09.851
Show bicycle tracks in the
dirt all over the property.

24:09.886 --> 24:12.253
Thank you very much,
Ryan. (Cell phone beeps)

24:12.288 --> 24:13.421
Bike tracks.

24:13.456 --> 24:14.590
There were bike tracks outside Kim's house.

24:14.624 --> 24:15.958
Dad, do you realize what this means?

24:15.992 --> 24:17.425
That maybe the party Kim went
to was at that farmhouse.

24:17.460 --> 24:19.327
And she saw kids doing meth.

24:19.361 --> 24:22.864
- Well, not just doing meth. Cooking meth.
- That's why she had to get out of there.

24:22.899 --> 24:25.766
- That's why she told Lyle she had some decisions to make.
- She was thinking about turning them in.

24:25.801 --> 24:27.334
So maybe when she left the party...

24:27.368 --> 24:29.003
One of our teenage meth cookers.

24:29.037 --> 24:31.005
Got worried she'd go to the cops.

24:31.039 --> 24:32.360
- So he went after her.
- On his bike.

24:32.373 --> 24:34.041
Mm-hmm. The tire tracks at her house...

24:34.076 --> 24:36.176
He knew where she lived because
he'd been there before.

24:36.211 --> 24:38.879
He was one of the other
guys Kim was seeing.

24:38.914 --> 24:41.681
(Together) We need to talk to Kim's mother.

24:41.716 --> 24:44.183
Now that was weird.

24:44.218 --> 24:46.019
Usually I do that with Beckett.

24:46.053 --> 24:48.054
Ew.

24:50.324 --> 24:52.391
(Door opens)

24:52.426 --> 24:53.960
Hey, what are you doing here?

24:53.995 --> 24:55.829
Hey. I, um...

24:55.863 --> 24:59.131
Just wanted to... thank
you for all of your help.

24:59.165 --> 25:00.766
With Castle and Alexis.

25:00.800 --> 25:03.936
Seemed like you could have done that
over the phone. (Gloves snap)

25:03.970 --> 25:06.138
All right. (Sighs) Talk to me, girlfriend.

25:06.172 --> 25:09.074
Tell me what's on your mind.

25:10.443 --> 25:12.444
Do you find it odd that Alexis has gone.

25:12.478 --> 25:14.211
To everyone but me on this case?

25:14.246 --> 25:15.479
She hasn't gone to Perlmutter yet.

25:15.514 --> 25:18.116
Yeah, well, no one
does if they can help it.

25:18.150 --> 25:20.518
Well, you can't take it personally.

25:20.552 --> 25:22.720
No, I know. It's just...

25:24.890 --> 25:26.323
Castle and I are about to become a family,

25:26.358 --> 25:29.460
which is weird enough as it is, and...

25:29.494 --> 25:31.628
He and Alexis have this whole history.

25:31.663 --> 25:33.496
That has nothing to do with me,

25:33.531 --> 25:36.700
and it kind of feels like
when it comes to the two of them,

25:36.734 --> 25:38.769
I'm always gonna be on the outside.

25:38.803 --> 25:42.105
Perfect families don't exist.

25:42.140 --> 25:44.374
It's gonna be up to you.

25:44.408 --> 25:46.776
To find a way to make your baggage.

25:46.810 --> 25:48.477
Match their baggage.

25:48.511 --> 25:50.479
It's up to you to make your own history.

25:53.550 --> 25:56.518
(Doorbell rings)

25:56.553 --> 25:59.488
Mrs. Tolbert, we're very sorry to intrude.

25:59.522 --> 26:00.923
You have some nerve.

26:00.957 --> 26:02.791
I know who you are, what
you're trying to do.

26:02.825 --> 26:04.625
Look, whatever you may have heard about us,

26:04.660 --> 26:06.961
we are not here to tell you that
Frank Henson is innocent.

26:06.996 --> 26:08.697
We'd just like to ask you some questions.

26:08.731 --> 26:10.231
Questions no one else can answer.

26:10.265 --> 26:12.200
Otherwise, we would not bother you.

26:12.234 --> 26:14.268
What questions?

26:14.303 --> 26:15.436
Did Kim have problems

26:15.470 --> 26:17.572
with any of the other guys she was seeing?

26:17.606 --> 26:19.873
There was no one else. Just Lyle.

26:19.908 --> 26:21.608
And she'd just broken off with him.

26:21.642 --> 26:23.043
Well, it's just that.

26:23.078 --> 26:25.679
We had heard that some other
boys had stopped by the house.

26:25.714 --> 26:29.083
Some boys? Yeah, she was a tutor.

26:29.117 --> 26:31.284
Some of her students were embarrassed.

26:31.319 --> 26:33.386
That they needed help, so
she kept things quiet.

26:33.421 --> 26:35.221
That's who she was.

26:35.255 --> 26:37.523
Do you remember these students' names?

26:37.557 --> 26:40.860
I'm not about to let you
hang this on one of them.

26:40.894 --> 26:43.362
- Now you need to leave.
- Thank you for your time.

26:43.396 --> 26:45.464
Oh, oh, Ma'am, just one more question.

26:45.498 --> 26:46.766
What subject did Kim tutor?

26:46.800 --> 26:48.901
Chemistry.

26:52.138 --> 26:55.006
- Dad...
- I know. Kim tutored chemistry.

26:55.041 --> 26:57.408
So what if one of her students tricked her.

26:57.443 --> 26:59.111
Into helping him learn how to cook meth?

26:59.145 --> 27:01.426
And when she figured out what
he was doing, he killed her.

27:01.614 --> 27:04.716
No, there's something else.

27:04.751 --> 27:07.417
As soon as Mrs. Tolbert
said "Chemistry," I remembered.

27:07.452 --> 27:09.586
Look at this. Two
identical chemistry books.

27:09.621 --> 27:11.255
Were found at the scene of the crime.

27:11.289 --> 27:13.590
So maybe the other one belonged
to one of her students.

27:13.625 --> 27:15.385
Right, but a textbook
like this is expensive.

27:15.393 --> 27:16.693
If you lost one, you'd have to pay a fine.

27:16.728 --> 27:17.795
You'd want it back.

27:17.829 --> 27:19.196
Unless it would implicate you in a murder.

27:19.231 --> 27:21.065
Dad, if we figure out whose book this is,

27:21.099 --> 27:22.199
we might find our killer.

27:22.234 --> 27:23.367
I don't know if that's possible.

27:23.401 --> 27:24.868
I mean, these books are over 15 years old.

27:24.902 --> 27:26.069
It's worth a shot.

27:26.103 --> 27:28.872
Actually, some of
them are over 20 years old.

27:28.906 --> 27:31.408
But because of budget
cuts, we still use them.

27:31.442 --> 27:34.278
Can you pull up records
all the way back to 1998?

27:34.312 --> 27:36.813
Well, even if I can, I probably shouldn't.

27:36.847 --> 27:38.414
Uh... perhaps.

27:38.448 --> 27:41.150
A generous donation for
new textbooks is in order.

27:41.184 --> 27:44.253
I suppose I could bend the rules.

27:44.288 --> 27:46.756
These are the barcodes from each book.

27:46.790 --> 27:47.856
(Mouse clicking)

27:47.891 --> 27:49.392
Make it out to "Cash."

27:49.426 --> 27:51.160
Hmm. (Clicking continues)

27:51.194 --> 27:54.329
Hmm. Hmm...

27:54.363 --> 27:57.832
Where are ya? Oh, let's see...

27:57.866 --> 28:00.168
Both of them are
actually still in our system.

28:00.202 --> 28:03.738
Loaned out September 8th, 1998.

28:03.773 --> 28:07.108
- Neither was ever returned.
- Any way you can figure out who they belonged to?

28:07.142 --> 28:08.443
Hmm. (Resumes clicking mouse)

28:08.477 --> 28:13.013
Mm. One was Kim
Tolbert's... The poor girl who died.

28:13.047 --> 28:14.147
And the other one?

28:14.182 --> 28:17.651
Uh, looks like it
belonged to one John Henson.

28:17.686 --> 28:19.520
Oh, my God.

28:19.554 --> 28:20.887
That's Frank's younger brother.

28:28.331 --> 28:30.718
The chemistry book puts
John in Kim's house,

28:30.864 --> 28:32.465
but we're gonna need a lot more than that.

28:32.499 --> 28:33.833
To prove he's our killer.

28:33.867 --> 28:35.267
These files are all on Frank.

28:35.302 --> 28:37.436
There's not a lot here on John.

28:37.471 --> 28:40.172
(Cup clatters) How long until
Ryan finishes his background check?

28:40.207 --> 28:41.708
He should be calling any minute.

28:41.742 --> 28:43.275
Have you managed to find anything.

28:43.310 --> 28:44.911
That might link John to the murder.

28:44.945 --> 28:48.080
No, but I did find
something that links John to Kim.

28:48.114 --> 28:50.348
According to this accident report,

28:50.382 --> 28:53.384
Frank was speeding and
got in a car crash in '97.

28:53.419 --> 28:54.586
John was with him.

28:54.621 --> 28:56.855
He was hurt pretty badly.

28:56.889 --> 28:58.223
He had to miss a lot of school.

28:58.257 --> 28:59.825
He was taking chemistry that semester,

28:59.859 --> 29:02.760
which is probably why he
needed tutoring from Kim.

29:02.794 --> 29:04.895
(Cell phone chimes) That'll be Ryan.

29:05.964 --> 29:07.732
"John Henson. Clean record.

29:07.766 --> 29:10.467
No convictions, no arrests." Whoa, wait.

29:10.502 --> 29:13.370
One arrest in '98, 3 months
before Kim was killed,

29:13.404 --> 29:15.472
for possession of a controlled substance.

29:15.507 --> 29:16.841
Meth?

29:16.875 --> 29:18.975
Doesn't say, and the charges were dropped,

29:19.010 --> 29:21.377
but this establishes John
was involved in drugs.

29:21.411 --> 29:22.946
And if Kim had gone to the police.

29:22.980 --> 29:24.313
Saying he was a meth cooker,

29:24.348 --> 29:26.449
he wouldn't have gotten
off with a slap on the wrist.

29:26.483 --> 29:27.851
That's motive for murder.

29:27.885 --> 29:29.352
We need to talk to John.

29:29.386 --> 29:31.320
According to this, he lives in Manhattan.

29:33.157 --> 29:35.624
(Beckett) Thank you for
coming in, Mr. Henson.

29:35.659 --> 29:37.960
Anything for Frank.

29:37.994 --> 29:39.795
Of course, at this
point, he needs a miracle.

29:39.829 --> 29:41.664
(Pen clicks) I've
always supported my brother.

29:41.698 --> 29:43.732
I never wanted to
think he could have hurt Kim,

29:43.767 --> 29:46.001
but if someone else did this,

29:46.036 --> 29:47.602
why haven't they been found by now?

29:47.637 --> 29:49.738
Well, maybe no one was
looking in the right place.

29:49.773 --> 29:51.172
Now how well did you know Kim?

29:51.206 --> 29:52.707
Well, I saw her every day at school.

29:52.741 --> 29:55.043
Anywhere else? Outside of class?

29:55.077 --> 29:57.578
Her house, sometimes. She tutored me.

29:57.612 --> 30:00.081
And were you at her
house the day that she died?

30:00.115 --> 30:01.883
No. Why?

30:01.917 --> 30:03.985
We were just wondering what
your chemistry book.

30:04.019 --> 30:06.087
Was doing at her house.

30:07.855 --> 30:09.923
Well, I must have left
it there... or forgot it.

30:09.957 --> 30:12.325
And you never asked for it
back? I mean, Kim was killed.

30:12.359 --> 30:14.094
Somewhere in the
middle of your school term.

30:14.128 --> 30:15.628
Wouldn't you have needed it?

30:15.663 --> 30:17.463
Well, I might have bought a new one.

30:17.498 --> 30:19.499
It was a long time ago.
I don't really remember.

30:19.533 --> 30:20.901
Why does that matter?

30:20.935 --> 30:22.169
You know, it probably doesn't.

30:22.203 --> 30:23.402
Um... (Paper rustles)

30:23.436 --> 30:24.837
Now in your statement,

30:24.871 --> 30:27.506
you said you were in your
room at the time of Kim's murder,

30:27.540 --> 30:29.108
but you didn't hear her scream.

30:29.142 --> 30:30.676
That's right.

30:30.711 --> 30:33.212
Did you hear any other unusual
sounds that night?

30:33.246 --> 30:35.681
Uh, not that I can think of.

30:35.716 --> 30:37.382
What about the smoke alarm?

30:37.417 --> 30:39.784
Yeah, no, I did hear that.

30:39.819 --> 30:40.919
(Papers rustle)

30:40.953 --> 30:42.754
In Frank's trial testimony,

30:42.788 --> 30:44.589
he never mentioned you coming
down to the garage,

30:44.623 --> 30:46.791
so you were in your room the whole time.

30:46.826 --> 30:49.227
- The alarm was going off?
- Yes, I was.

30:49.261 --> 30:51.996
Now I find that odd, Mr. Henson,

30:52.031 --> 30:55.699
because the security
company logs show the alarm sounded.

30:55.734 --> 30:57.234
For a full two minutes.

30:57.268 --> 30:58.435
And 47 seconds,

30:58.469 --> 31:00.637
but you stayed in your
room that whole time.

31:00.671 --> 31:02.472
Never got up to check and make sure.

31:02.506 --> 31:04.241
That the house wasn't burning down?

31:07.078 --> 31:09.713
You never heard the
alarm going off, did you?

31:09.748 --> 31:10.747
Because you weren't in your house.

31:10.781 --> 31:11.748
What are you saying?

31:11.782 --> 31:13.415
That I killed Kim, that I did it?

31:13.450 --> 31:14.650
Where were you that night?

31:14.684 --> 31:15.818
(Huffs)

31:15.853 --> 31:18.254
I'm not answering any
more of your questions.

31:28.564 --> 31:30.531
What is this, guys? I thought we were done.

31:30.566 --> 31:33.668
Mr. Henson, we've, uh,
uncovered some new evidence...

31:33.702 --> 31:37.639
Evidence that suggests someone
else killed Kim Tolbert.

31:38.941 --> 31:42.510
Who? Frank, I know this
is going to be hard to hear,

31:42.544 --> 31:44.145
but we think it could be John.

31:44.179 --> 31:47.948
No. John? Based on what?

31:47.983 --> 31:50.184
His chemistry book was
found at the crime scene.

31:50.218 --> 31:53.154
His alibi for where he was when
Kim died is falling apart.

31:53.188 --> 31:54.922
What the hell is wrong with you?

31:56.557 --> 31:58.692
I told you to drop it. What do you mean?

31:58.726 --> 32:00.193
Frank, we're really on to something.

32:00.227 --> 32:03.362
And I'm saying get off it.
You leave John out of this.

32:03.397 --> 32:05.665
Honey, what's wrong with
you? If John did this...

32:05.699 --> 32:07.000
He knows.

32:08.669 --> 32:09.836
He knows it was John.

32:15.241 --> 32:17.475
Frank? Is this true?

32:17.510 --> 32:19.011
I...

32:19.045 --> 32:21.646
You knew this whole time?

32:21.681 --> 32:24.183
Why would you do this?

32:24.217 --> 32:26.018
Why would you throw your life away?

32:26.052 --> 32:28.053
Because I threw his away.

32:28.087 --> 32:32.056
Okay? I'm the reason why he killed her.

32:32.090 --> 32:34.192
No. Frank, whatever John
did, it can't be your fault.

32:34.226 --> 32:36.694
You remember that
Camaro I was telling you about?

32:36.728 --> 32:37.728
I rolled that car...

32:37.762 --> 32:39.997
With Johnny in it.

32:40.032 --> 32:41.899
I walked away...

32:41.934 --> 32:43.835
But he didn't.

32:43.869 --> 32:47.403
After the head injury, he
wasn't right for a while.

32:47.438 --> 32:49.072
He started taking drugs.

32:49.106 --> 32:51.041
He got violent.

32:51.075 --> 32:53.343
He'd have these memory lapses.

32:53.377 --> 32:54.845
He wouldn't remember what he did.

32:54.879 --> 32:56.213
(Castle) Frank.

32:57.849 --> 32:59.682
What really happened that night?

32:59.717 --> 33:02.219
My worst nightmare came true.

33:02.253 --> 33:05.054
(Beeping)

33:05.088 --> 33:08.190
It's off now. Thank you.

33:08.225 --> 33:10.759
(Kim screams)

33:10.793 --> 33:14.296
(Sobbing)

33:17.901 --> 33:18.933
Oh, my God.

33:18.968 --> 33:20.335
(Continues sobbing)

33:20.369 --> 33:21.836
What'd you do, John? What'd you do?!

33:23.105 --> 33:25.606
(Both grunting) (Charms clatter)

33:25.640 --> 33:27.242
(Panting) You gotta get out of here.

33:27.276 --> 33:29.244
You hear me? Go back to the house.

33:29.278 --> 33:31.545
Get cleaned up. Go! Now!

33:38.753 --> 33:40.020
(Sirens wailing)

33:40.054 --> 33:42.189
The next thing I knew, the cops were there.

33:42.223 --> 33:44.724
I mean... what was I supposed to do?

33:44.759 --> 33:47.094
- People need to know, Frank.
- No, they don't.

33:47.128 --> 33:49.562
And if they ask me, I'm gonna deny it.

33:49.597 --> 33:51.797
- They're about to kill you.
- I know.

33:51.831 --> 33:53.933
And you're gonna let them, when
it was John who did this.

33:53.967 --> 33:55.868
Maggie, he doesn't remember.

33:55.903 --> 33:58.570
I-it took three, four
times of him coming here.

33:58.605 --> 34:00.239
For me to realize that
he... he doesn't remember

34:00.274 --> 34:02.741
anything from that night.

34:02.776 --> 34:05.077
Look, I always hoped I'd get off.

34:05.112 --> 34:06.745
On some kind of technicality, you know?

34:06.780 --> 34:08.947
Not this.

34:08.981 --> 34:10.415
Never this.

34:10.449 --> 34:12.284
He's built a life.

34:12.318 --> 34:14.085
He's got a wife.

34:14.120 --> 34:15.652
He's got two kids,

34:15.687 --> 34:17.956
and I-I'm not gonna
take that away from him.

34:17.989 --> 34:20.458
(Exhales unevenly) Frank, please...

34:20.492 --> 34:22.327
I'm sorry.

34:22.360 --> 34:24.795
This is the way it's gotta be.

34:26.431 --> 34:29.599
(Gasps and breathes unevenly)

34:36.541 --> 34:38.574
There must be something we can do.

34:38.609 --> 34:40.842
It's not what Frank wants.

34:40.877 --> 34:43.179
But he's innocent,
dad, and he's going to die.

34:43.213 --> 34:44.580
Tomorrow.

34:44.614 --> 34:45.848
I know.

34:45.882 --> 34:49.351
I actually started
believing we could save the guy.

34:49.386 --> 34:51.353
And we almost did.

34:51.388 --> 34:54.190
I know how much he loves Maggie.

34:54.224 --> 34:55.924
If he just had more
time to think about this,

34:55.958 --> 34:58.726
maybe he'd change his mind.

34:58.761 --> 35:01.496
But the clock just ran out.

35:01.530 --> 35:03.065
The clock.

35:04.968 --> 35:07.302
What time was that 911 call again?

35:07.337 --> 35:10.305
Uh, neighbor reported
hearing the scream at 8:04 P.M.

35:10.340 --> 35:12.173
Why? We missed something.

35:12.207 --> 35:13.740
Come take a look at this photo.

35:13.775 --> 35:16.444
This wall decoration could have
fallen down during the struggle.

35:16.478 --> 35:18.312
You mean the solar system thingy?

35:18.347 --> 35:20.114
<i>Not just a solar system thingy.</i>

35:20.148 --> 35:22.216
Our orbiting planets don't
line up like that.

35:22.250 --> 35:23.784
This is a binary clock.

35:23.818 --> 35:26.120
- That's a clock?
- Yeah. For science geeks like Kim.

35:26.154 --> 35:27.887
You count the amount of
planets in each quadrant,

35:27.921 --> 35:31.224
it tells you the time. In this case, 7:32.

35:31.258 --> 35:34.660
7:32? That's a
half-hour before our 911 call.

35:34.695 --> 35:36.335
That's because the scream that Frank heard.

35:36.364 --> 35:39.366
Came from John we he
discovered Kim's body at 8:04.

35:39.400 --> 35:42.235
She'd already been dead for 30 minutes.

35:42.269 --> 35:44.736
Both brothers are innocent.

35:55.429 --> 35:57.363
Hey. I just got off the
phone with Kim's mom.

35:57.397 --> 35:58.864
Whoa. You called Kim's mom?

35:58.898 --> 36:00.166
Desperate times.

36:00.200 --> 36:01.833
- And she didn't hang up on you?
- No.

36:01.868 --> 36:03.035
She mostly yelled.

36:03.070 --> 36:04.303
She wouldn't tell me who Kim tutored,

36:04.337 --> 36:05.704
but she did say that all the checks

36:05.738 --> 36:08.840
Kim got from tutoring went
into her college fund.

36:08.875 --> 36:10.442
So she was paid by check.

36:10.476 --> 36:13.278
That means somewhere
there's a record of who paid her.

36:13.312 --> 36:16.181
Mm-hmm. Ryan and
Esposito are checking banks now.

36:16.215 --> 36:17.348
This is it, dad.

36:17.383 --> 36:19.451
Jasper Grove, meth, the bike tracks...

36:19.485 --> 36:20.886
If it wasn't Frank or John,

36:20.920 --> 36:23.088
it has to be one of those other kids.

36:24.156 --> 36:26.490
You still going through that video?

36:26.524 --> 36:29.594
Yeah. Now that we know
neither Frank or John killed her,

36:29.628 --> 36:31.062
this video plays very differently.

36:31.096 --> 36:32.529
Watch this. (Click)

36:35.067 --> 36:36.901
(Click)

36:38.604 --> 36:39.604
See that?

36:39.638 --> 36:40.838
No. What?

36:40.872 --> 36:42.706
Frank said he found her body on the floor.

36:42.740 --> 36:44.841
Did he ever mention moving her?

36:44.875 --> 36:47.343
No. According to Frank,
he just pulled John away.

36:47.377 --> 36:49.145
Exactly. Breaking the charm bracelet,

36:49.179 --> 36:50.680
spilling the charms on the floor.

36:50.715 --> 36:53.783
But watch as a medical examiner's team.

36:53.818 --> 36:56.152
Moves her body for the first time.

37:03.292 --> 37:04.459
(Click) See it now?

37:04.494 --> 37:06.461
It looks like another
charm from her bracelet.

37:06.496 --> 37:08.697
But if the charm
bracelet broke after she died,

37:08.732 --> 37:11.967
how did the charm end up under her body?

37:14.003 --> 37:16.537
Okay, Castle, we got the
evidence box from the lab.

37:16.571 --> 37:19.040
- What are we looking for?
- Okay, the evidence log says.

37:19.074 --> 37:20.942
There should be a bag containing charms.

37:20.976 --> 37:23.845
- From Kim's broken charm bracelet.
- Got it.

37:23.879 --> 37:25.919
One of those charms should
be shaped like a dolphin.

37:31.252 --> 37:32.452
It's here.

37:32.486 --> 37:33.987
You should have the
rope bracelet there, too.

37:34.022 --> 37:36.556
Thread that dolphin
charm onto the bracelet.

37:36.590 --> 37:38.725
Okay... I'm threading.

37:40.728 --> 37:43.063
Nope. Can't do it. The hole's too small.

37:43.097 --> 37:46.198
It doesn't fit. That's because
it didn't come from Kim's bracelet.

37:46.232 --> 37:47.566
It was left behind by our killer.

37:47.600 --> 37:49.735
Lanie, can you get DNA off that charm?

37:49.770 --> 37:51.937
Maybe, but it won't help unless you have.

37:51.972 --> 37:53.338
Someone to match it to.

37:54.507 --> 37:56.341
We need to know who she was tutoring.

37:58.378 --> 38:00.579
You should call them
again. (Breathing nervously)

38:00.613 --> 38:02.080
I just called them 20 minutes ago.

38:02.114 --> 38:04.883
I don't understand. Why
is it taking so long?

38:04.917 --> 38:07.418
Ryan found the bank where
Kim had her account hours ago.

38:07.452 --> 38:09.387
The account was closed in '98.

38:09.421 --> 38:11.122
The bank has moved three times since then.

38:11.157 --> 38:14.192
- They may not have even kept the files.
- And what if they didn't?

38:14.226 --> 38:16.494
- We're running out of time. We need to go to the judge.
- With what?

38:16.528 --> 38:18.462
Frank will never
admit to covering for John.

38:18.497 --> 38:19.863
That would put John at the crime scene.

38:19.898 --> 38:22.633
So what do we do? Dad, tell me what to do!

38:22.668 --> 38:24.635
Hey, I don't know, but whatever happens,

38:24.670 --> 38:26.170
we're gonna deal with it.

38:26.205 --> 38:27.805
All right?

38:27.839 --> 38:29.106
Together.

38:32.811 --> 38:34.544
I'm sorry I was mad at you.

38:34.579 --> 38:35.978
Oh, no.

38:36.013 --> 38:39.782
I deserved it. I'm sorry.

38:39.817 --> 38:40.917
(Cell phone rings)

38:42.653 --> 38:44.153
(Beep) Yes?

38:44.188 --> 38:45.888
What are the names?

38:45.923 --> 38:47.090
(Gasps)

38:47.124 --> 38:48.225
(Clicks pen)

38:57.166 --> 38:59.768
- (Castle) Chief Lane.
- Can I help you?

38:59.802 --> 39:02.271
No, chief. But we can help you.

39:02.305 --> 39:04.840
This little dolphin pendant.

39:04.874 --> 39:06.508
Was found in Kim Tolbert's living
room the night she died,

39:06.543 --> 39:08.176
underneath her body.

39:08.211 --> 39:09.510
So? (Slides photo)

39:09.545 --> 39:10.612
So it's not hers.

39:10.646 --> 39:12.814
You people are unbelievable.

39:12.849 --> 39:14.649
Officer Lane, how old
were you when Kim died?

39:14.683 --> 39:16.785
- Excuse me?
- You were in her class.

39:16.819 --> 39:18.319
In fact, she tutored you, didn't she?

39:18.354 --> 39:19.821
What's this all about?

39:19.856 --> 39:21.990
Checks you wrote to Kim Tolbert, chief,

39:22.024 --> 39:23.157
to pay for your son's tutoring.

39:23.191 --> 39:24.959
Needed some help keeping his grades up.

39:24.993 --> 39:26.560
Yeah, I bet because of swim team.

39:26.594 --> 39:29.830
You guys took state that
year. It was big news.

39:31.532 --> 39:34.001
Teddy, what's going on here?

39:34.035 --> 39:36.603
The night Kim Tolbert was murdered,

39:36.638 --> 39:38.038
she was in Jasper Grove,

39:38.073 --> 39:40.740
near a farmhouse you had foreclosed
on a year earlier.

39:40.775 --> 39:42.842
That house was later
found to be contaminated.

39:42.877 --> 39:44.343
With methamphetamine residue.

39:44.378 --> 39:47.213
We believe your son was one of
the people who contaminated it.

39:47.248 --> 39:49.849
We also believe he wanted
to be tutored in chemistry.

39:49.884 --> 39:51.751
So he could learn how to cook meth.

39:51.786 --> 39:52.919
This is ridiculous.

39:52.953 --> 39:55.120
(Castle) But Kim caught on to you,

39:55.155 --> 39:57.589
and that was bad for business.

39:57.623 --> 39:59.925
So when she left that
party, you followed her.

39:59.959 --> 40:02.027
(Alexis) We found ammonium
nitrate on her body.

40:02.061 --> 40:04.496
I'd be willing to bet that the tire treads.

40:04.530 --> 40:06.231
Outside the farmhouse are
going to be a match.

40:06.266 --> 40:07.666
To the bike treads behind Kim's house.

40:07.700 --> 40:09.668
The night of her murder.

40:09.702 --> 40:12.503
And then, of course, there's that.

40:14.973 --> 40:17.208
(Castle) Now that's
enough circumstantial evidence.

40:17.242 --> 40:18.676
For a judge...

40:18.710 --> 40:20.845
But it's 2013.

40:20.879 --> 40:23.547
I mean, now we can even take degraded DNA,

40:23.581 --> 40:26.017
have it amplified, tested.

40:26.051 --> 40:28.718
And I'm sure that your evidence storage.

40:28.752 --> 40:32.055
Has kept your dolphin well preserved.

40:37.295 --> 40:38.361
Teddy?

40:38.395 --> 40:40.797
Say something.

40:40.832 --> 40:42.699
Look at me.

40:44.067 --> 40:45.534
Teddy!

40:45.568 --> 40:47.937
(Breathes unevenly)

40:50.307 --> 40:51.640
(Judge) Based on

40:51.674 --> 40:53.809
the overwhelming circumstantial evidence.

40:53.844 --> 40:55.811
And the exculpatory results.

40:55.846 --> 40:58.413
Obtained from post-conviction DNA testing,

40:58.448 --> 41:00.781
the commonwealth of
Pennsylvania hereby vacates

41:00.816 --> 41:03.784
Franklin Thomas Henson's murder conviction.

41:03.819 --> 41:06.988
And sanctions his exoneration.

41:07.022 --> 41:09.623
(Gallery murmuring)

41:09.658 --> 41:10.959
I'm sure you've spent far too many years.

41:10.993 --> 41:12.760
Having judges look down on you,

41:12.794 --> 41:14.562
so I'll come down from
the bench and deliver.

41:14.596 --> 41:17.464
The signed order of dismissal myself.

41:27.876 --> 41:29.676
Thank you.

41:29.710 --> 41:30.777
(Gasps)

41:30.811 --> 41:33.445
(Applause continues)

41:35.315 --> 41:37.183
(Both laugh)

41:37.217 --> 41:40.452
Mm... (Sniffles)

41:41.654 --> 41:43.089
I thought it was you.

41:43.123 --> 41:46.292
All this time, you were protecting me.

41:46.326 --> 41:48.293
(Sobbing) How can you ever forgive me?

41:48.327 --> 41:51.129
Ahh... forgive you? (Sniffles)

41:51.163 --> 41:53.965
I love you.

41:54.000 --> 41:55.834
I'm just ready to live, brother.

41:58.838 --> 42:00.672
What you did here was amazing.

42:02.074 --> 42:03.241
Thank you...

42:04.976 --> 42:06.778
For everything.

42:06.812 --> 42:08.613
Anytime.

42:10.382 --> 42:12.049
You ready?

42:12.083 --> 42:13.918
Don't you want to stay and celebrate?

42:13.952 --> 42:15.620
No.

42:18.156 --> 42:20.189
This is enough.

42:21.626 --> 42:23.593
Besides, there's someone else

42:23.628 --> 42:24.928
I need to thank.
