[theme music playing]

00:28.561 --> 00:30.230
[Bertie's stomach growling]

00:30.330 --> 00:31.264
Hey, Hubie!

00:31.364 --> 00:33.600
I'm... I'm so hungry.

00:33.700 --> 00:35.268
I ain't gonna make it.

00:35.368 --> 00:36.569
Go on without me, Hubie.

00:36.669 --> 00:38.538
I'm done for!

00:38.605 --> 00:40.240
Snap out of it, Bertie.

00:40.340 --> 00:41.608
Snap out of it!

00:41.708 --> 00:43.777
I said I was gonna find us food, didn't I?

00:43.877 --> 00:44.878
Look!

00:47.414 --> 00:48.715
Cheese!

00:50.116 --> 00:52.018
Calm down, calm down!

00:54.888 --> 00:56.556
Look. See?

00:56.623 --> 00:57.857
What did I tell ya?

01:00.727 --> 01:03.763
[shopkeeper] Ah,  mein  perfect cheeses.

01:03.863 --> 01:08.635
Each slice a painstakingly intricate work of art.

01:08.735 --> 01:12.038
Und  that is why I've hired you to look after them

01:12.105 --> 01:13.306
while I go beddy-bye.

01:14.607 --> 01:16.309
Und  you better keep them safe.

01:16.409 --> 01:19.479
When I see any of my perfect cheeses vandalized,

01:19.579 --> 01:21.081
I go crah-zzinphrapin!!!

01:23.249 --> 01:25.251
Looks like we ain't gonna be getting' any cheese

01:25.318 --> 01:27.620
outta that cheese shop with that cat in the way.

01:28.755 --> 01:30.824
What did I do? What did I do?

01:30.924 --> 01:32.425
You talk too much.

01:32.492 --> 01:33.893
Now, listen!

01:33.960 --> 01:37.397
We ain't takin' the cheese out of the cheese shop.

01:37.464 --> 01:38.331
We're not?

01:38.431 --> 01:39.499
Nuh-uh.

01:39.599 --> 01:41.134
We're gonna get rid of that cat, see?

01:41.234 --> 01:42.836
-Huh? -Come here.

01:42.936 --> 01:45.105
Here's what we do. [whispering]

01:46.439 --> 01:48.274
[chuckling] Riot!

02:01.621 --> 02:03.256
[shopkeeper] Claude?

02:03.323 --> 02:05.658
What exactly are you doing, hmm?

02:10.964 --> 02:13.700
So, trying to get a freebie, hey?

02:13.800 --> 02:17.537
I thought I told you to keep my cheeses in perfect condition!

02:17.637 --> 02:20.940
If you so much as scratch one more of my perfect cheeses,

02:21.007 --> 02:23.710
out you go with the rest of the stinky trash!

02:23.810 --> 02:24.677
[door slams]

02:24.777 --> 02:25.945
Come on, Bert.

02:26.012 --> 02:28.648
Time to cause some more mis-cheese.

02:28.715 --> 02:30.350
[Bertie chuckles] Yeah!

02:47.834 --> 02:51.704
[shopkeeper] Claude? Is that you making noise again?

02:54.374 --> 02:56.709
Everything in order?

02:56.809 --> 03:01.214
Hmm... Okay, then. But no more funny stuff!

03:02.348 --> 03:03.416
[door slams]

03:03.516 --> 03:04.684
Phew!

03:17.931 --> 03:19.699
Bring over that Winnimere, Bert.

03:19.766 --> 03:21.067
Yeah, yeah, sure, sure.

03:25.004 --> 03:26.172
Yeow!

03:28.041 --> 03:29.209
Hey, cat!

03:34.047 --> 03:35.114
[clears throat]

04:02.775 --> 04:05.411
Gee, Hubie, you're a natural  artiste.

04:05.478 --> 04:06.546
Hey, thanks.

04:06.613 --> 04:08.581
I learned from watching cartoons!

04:11.818 --> 04:12.785
[Hubie whistles]

04:12.885 --> 04:14.587
[Hubie] Squeak, squeak, squeak!

04:16.756 --> 04:18.224
Squeak, squeak, squeak!

04:21.227 --> 04:22.161
[whistles]

04:22.262 --> 04:23.763
Uh, squeak!

04:33.406 --> 04:34.841
[panting]

04:45.184 --> 04:47.453
Hey, Bert, come here!

04:47.520 --> 04:49.255
Help me turn up the heat!

04:54.761 --> 04:55.662
Phew!

04:58.798 --> 05:00.033
[gasping]

05:02.335 --> 05:03.202
[alarm rings]

05:08.041 --> 05:11.844
[shopkeeper] Claude! What's causing that racket?

05:11.944 --> 05:15.148
Mein  cheeses better be in pristine condition.

05:16.516 --> 05:19.652
Enough! I am coming down there immediately!

05:19.719 --> 05:22.322
Right after I put on my shoes.

05:22.388 --> 05:23.690
Und  my lederhosen!

05:25.224 --> 05:26.693
Just  ein  moment!

05:26.793 --> 05:29.529
I've got a hangnail that's bothering me. [shouts]

05:30.630 --> 05:32.632
Okay, here I am coming!

05:35.868 --> 05:37.537
[panting]

05:37.637 --> 05:40.640
Oh-ho! Taking a nap, hmm?

05:40.707 --> 05:45.712
Well, at least my cheeses are still in perfect shape, I see.

05:45.812 --> 05:48.314
Everything looks in order here, I suppose.

05:48.381 --> 05:50.316
I guess I'll go back to  mein  sleeping.

05:51.250 --> 05:52.218
[shopkeeper] Eh?

05:53.019 --> 05:54.420
What was that?

05:54.520 --> 05:59.092
Claude... what is that you are having in your mouth?

05:59.192 --> 06:01.427
Oh, yes. Open your mouth, now!

06:04.530 --> 06:05.398
[explosion]

06:08.101 --> 06:09.235
That is the last straw!

06:09.335 --> 06:10.770
Out, out, out!

06:14.507 --> 06:17.777
Now then, you are my new guard kitty.

06:17.877 --> 06:22.281
I know you will keep my cheese safe from the mice.

06:23.583 --> 06:27.019
It'd be a real tragedy if some mice got in here.

06:27.086 --> 06:30.256
Yeah. It'd be a darn shame!

06:30.356 --> 06:31.791
[laughs]

06:37.530 --> 06:39.932
[humming]

06:42.402 --> 06:44.537
[police sirens approaching]

06:46.406 --> 06:47.640
[sputtering] Pull over!

06:48.875 --> 06:50.610
[brakes squeal]

06:53.746 --> 06:55.882
What seems to be the problem, Officer?

06:55.948 --> 06:58.551
I'm gonna have to see your driver's license, sir.

06:58.618 --> 07:00.586
Certainly. Here you are.

07:05.391 --> 07:09.662
Um, this is a boating license, sir!

07:09.762 --> 07:10.830
Of course it is!

07:10.930 --> 07:12.165
What do you think I'm drivin' here, buddy?

07:16.636 --> 07:18.271
[whooping]

07:26.412 --> 07:28.481
[theme music playing]

07:40.326 --> 07:43.362
Okay, Cicero, ready to learn how to bowl?

07:43.463 --> 07:47.133
Bowling? More like boring!

07:48.034 --> 07:50.870
Hey, give that back!

07:50.970 --> 07:55.675
No! We won't be playing any virtual games today.

07:55.775 --> 07:58.277
We're here to play a real game.

08:01.814 --> 08:04.984
Come on, Cicero. Just try to have some fun.

08:05.785 --> 08:06.886
[exhales deeply]

08:06.986 --> 08:08.554
Okay.

08:08.654 --> 08:10.723
[chuckles] That's the spirit.

08:10.823 --> 08:12.725
Now, please get me a ball.

08:14.193 --> 08:15.828
[blows raspberry]

08:17.196 --> 08:18.064
[grunting]

08:26.405 --> 08:27.306
[laughing]

08:30.676 --> 08:33.579
Maybe bowling isn't so boring after all.

08:33.679 --> 08:35.882
[laughing]

08:38.184 --> 08:40.920
Cicero, that was not funny.

08:41.020 --> 08:42.421
Sorry, Uncle Porky.

08:42.522 --> 08:45.758
I'll try to be more careful next time.

08:46.526 --> 08:48.361
That's okay, Cicero.

08:48.427 --> 08:50.997
Why don't you have a seat and see how it's done.

08:54.233 --> 08:57.904
First, put your little piggies into the finger holes,

08:58.004 --> 09:02.275
bring the ball to your chest and approach the line.

09:03.876 --> 09:05.711
[baby cooing]

09:08.948 --> 09:09.949
Swing back...

09:11.417 --> 09:12.852
and release the baby.

09:16.856 --> 09:17.957
A baby?!

09:18.758 --> 09:20.126
I got you, baby!

09:22.461 --> 09:23.296
Phew!

09:24.564 --> 09:28.134
That was close... Almost a bad one.

09:29.135 --> 09:29.969
Papa.

09:31.537 --> 09:34.974
What do you think you're doing with my little man?

09:35.074 --> 09:37.410
Oh. [chuckles nervously]

09:37.476 --> 09:40.146
This little man? Oh, I was just...

09:44.650 --> 09:47.320
[Cicero laughing]

09:50.489 --> 09:53.159
Oh, hi, Uncle Pinhead.

09:53.259 --> 09:57.630
Cicero, why did you hand me a baby and not a bowling ball?

09:57.730 --> 09:59.231
I'm sorry, Uncle Porky.

09:59.298 --> 10:02.935
How was I supposed to know you can't bowl with babies?

10:03.002 --> 10:07.006
Well, I suppose that it could be an easy beginner's mistake.

10:07.106 --> 10:09.075
Why don't you just get me another ball, hmm?

10:09.141 --> 10:11.644
Sure thing, my dearest uncle.

10:13.846 --> 10:15.081
Kids these days.

10:15.147 --> 10:17.016
[laughs mischievously] Time for some fun.

10:18.651 --> 10:20.353
This ought to  bee  good.

10:30.796 --> 10:33.599
Is this a good ball, Uncle Porky?

10:33.666 --> 10:35.601
Now, watch closely.

10:35.668 --> 10:39.205
Good form starts with a good grip.

10:39.305 --> 10:42.642
Put the fingers in the holes like this.

10:46.012 --> 10:47.313
[yelps]

10:50.216 --> 10:53.953
I didn't know that you could play bee ball too, Uncle P.

10:55.221 --> 10:56.122
[Porky shrieks]

10:57.490 --> 10:59.892
Great work, Uncle Porky. You got a strike!

11:00.693 --> 11:02.561
[upbeat music playing]

11:05.831 --> 11:07.199
My turn.

11:07.299 --> 11:09.468
I gotta pick out a good one like Uncle Porky said.

11:11.671 --> 11:12.738
Where am I?

11:17.176 --> 11:19.011
Ah! A perfect ball.

11:19.078 --> 11:22.381
I sure wish Uncle Porky were here to see me bowl.

11:22.481 --> 11:23.716
[Porky grunting]

11:23.816 --> 11:25.251
Okay.

11:25.351 --> 11:28.521
Fingers in the finger holes, just like Uncle Porky said.

11:28.587 --> 11:30.923
[groaning]

11:31.023 --> 11:33.325
Bring the ball up to your chest,

11:33.392 --> 11:39.098
walk up to the line, swing back and release.

11:39.198 --> 11:40.399
[Porky shrieking]

11:45.037 --> 11:46.238
All right!

11:46.338 --> 11:49.341
Uncle Porky was right. Bowling is fun.

11:53.746 --> 11:55.381
[neighing]

12:09.729 --> 12:11.430
[bell dinging]

12:11.530 --> 12:13.199
Hey, I won.

12:13.265 --> 12:14.533
[man] Congratulations.

12:14.600 --> 12:16.802
You just bowled the highest score ever.

12:16.902 --> 12:21.974
I present to you our esteemed "Bowler of the Year" award.

12:22.074 --> 12:23.909
Wow, this is great!

12:23.976 --> 12:24.944
Thanks, mister.

12:26.212 --> 12:28.748
Look at this trophy I got, Uncle Porky.

12:28.814 --> 12:30.816
And it's all because of you.

12:30.916 --> 12:33.385
Well, gee, that sure is nice.

12:33.452 --> 12:35.387
Why thank you, Cicero.

12:36.322 --> 12:37.456
What an honor.

12:40.626 --> 12:41.494
[exclaims]

12:43.129 --> 12:44.296
No!

12:44.396 --> 12:47.066
Looks like Uncle P won some bumblebees.

12:47.133 --> 12:48.634
-Get away! -[laughing]

12:56.408 --> 12:58.477
[theme music playing]
