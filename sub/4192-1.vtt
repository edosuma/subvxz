01:08.902 --> 01:13.573
(narrator) The Sarah Siddons Award
is perhaps unknown to you.

01:13.657 --> 01:16.576
It has been spared
the sensational publicity

01:16.660 --> 01:20.079
of such questionable honors
as the Pulitzer Prize

01:20.164 --> 01:25.001
and those awards presented annually
by that film society.

01:25.127 --> 01:29.088
The distinguished-looking gentleman
is an extremely old actor.

01:29.173 --> 01:32.592
Being an actor,
he will go on speaking for some time.

01:32.676 --> 01:35.762
It is not important
that you hear what he says.

01:35.846 --> 01:40.099
However, it is important that you know
where you are and why you are here.

01:40.184 --> 01:43.770
This is the dining hall
of the Sarah Siddons Society.

01:43.854 --> 01:49.358
It is the annual banquet and presentation
of the highest honor our theatre has:

01:49.485 --> 01:53.112
the Sarah Siddons Award for
Distinguished Achievement.

01:53.197 --> 01:56.032
These hallowed walls,
indeed many of these faces,

01:56.158 --> 02:00.286
have looked upon Modjeska,
Ada Rehan and Minnie Fiske.

02:00.370 --> 02:03.623
Mansfield's voice filled this room.

02:03.707 --> 02:07.543
It is unlikely that the windows
have been opened since his death.

02:07.836 --> 02:12.465
The minor awards, as you can see,
have already been presented.

02:12.549 --> 02:16.052
Minor awards are for such
as the writer and director,

02:16.136 --> 02:18.805
since they merely construct a tower

02:18.889 --> 02:22.809
so that the world can applaud
a light which flashes on top of it.

02:22.893 --> 02:27.313
And no brighter light has ever
dazzled the eye than Eve Harrington.

02:27.397 --> 02:30.733
Eve... But more of Eve later.

02:30.859 --> 02:32.985
All about Eve, in fact.

02:33.070 --> 02:35.029
To those who do not read,

02:35.113 --> 02:38.825
attend the theatre,
listen to unsponsored radio programs

02:38.909 --> 02:41.661
or know anything of the world
in which you live,

02:41.745 --> 02:45.164
it is perhaps necessary
to introduce myself.

02:45.249 --> 02:47.416
My name is Addison DeWitt.

02:47.501 --> 02:53.172
My native habitat is the theatre.
In it, I toil not. Neither do I spin.

02:53.257 --> 02:55.758
I am a critic and commentator.

02:55.884 --> 02:58.511
I am essential to the theatre.

02:58.595 --> 03:00.680
This is Karen Richards.

03:00.764 --> 03:05.268
She is the wife of a playwright,
therefore of the theatre by marriage.

03:05.394 --> 03:09.480
Nothing in her background should have
brought her closer to the stage

03:09.565 --> 03:11.816
than Row E.

03:11.900 --> 03:14.485
However,
during her senior year at Radcliffe,

03:14.570 --> 03:16.946
Lloyd Richards lectured on the drama.

03:17.030 --> 03:21.117
The following year
Karen became Mrs. Lloyd Richards.

03:21.243 --> 03:24.954
There are, in general,
two types of theatrical producers.

03:25.038 --> 03:29.542
One has a great many wealthy friends
who will risk a tax-deductible loss.

03:29.626 --> 03:32.044
This type is interested in art.

03:32.129 --> 03:36.549
The other is one to whom each production
means potential ruin or fortune.

03:36.633 --> 03:38.718
This type is out to make a buck.

03:38.969 --> 03:41.137
Meet Max Fabian.

03:41.263 --> 03:43.014
He is the producer of the play

03:43.098 --> 03:47.310
which has won for Eve Harrington
the Sarah Siddons Award.

03:48.145 --> 03:51.814
Margo Channing is a star of the theatre.

03:51.940 --> 03:55.234
She made her first stage appearance at
the age of four

03:55.319 --> 03:57.695
in Midsummer Night's Dream.

03:57.779 --> 04:02.408
She played a fairy and entered,
quite unexpectedly, stark naked.

04:02.492 --> 04:04.994
She has been a star ever since.

04:05.829 --> 04:09.081
Margo is a great star. A true star.

04:09.166 --> 04:13.169
She never was or will be
anything less or anything else.

04:14.755 --> 04:20.509
Having covered in tedious detail not only
the history of the Sarah Siddons Society,

04:20.636 --> 04:22.428
but also the history of acting

04:22.512 --> 04:26.098
since Thespis
first stepped out of the chorus line,

04:26.183 --> 04:30.519
our distinguished chairman has finally
arrived at our reason for being here.

04:30.646 --> 04:36.943
I have been proud and privileged
to have spent my life in the theatre,

04:37.027 --> 04:42.031
a poor player that struts
and frets his hour upon the stage,

04:42.699 --> 04:45.618
and I've been honored to be, for 40 years,

04:45.702 --> 04:49.664
chief prompter
of the Sarah Siddons Society.

04:50.707 --> 04:55.544
39 times have I placed in deserving hands

04:55.671 --> 04:59.298
this highest honor the theatre knows.

04:59.383 --> 05:02.301
Surely no actor is older than I.

05:02.386 --> 05:05.012
I've earned my place out of the sun.

05:05.097 --> 05:06.430
(laughter)

05:06.556 --> 05:12.395
And never before has this award gone to
anyone younger than its recipient tonight.

05:12.521 --> 05:16.691
How fitting that it should
pass from my hands to hers.

05:16.900 --> 05:20.528
Such young hands. Such a young lady.

05:20.904 --> 05:25.533
Young in years, but whose heart
is as old as the theatre.

05:25.909 --> 05:27.994
Some of us are privileged to know her.

05:28.078 --> 05:31.414
We have seen
beyond the beauty and artistry

05:31.498 --> 05:34.750
that have made her name
resound through the nation.

05:34.835 --> 05:38.754
We know her humility, her devotion,

05:38.839 --> 05:40.923
her loyalty to her art,

05:41.049 --> 05:45.594
her love, her deep and abiding love for us,

05:45.721 --> 05:50.433
for what we are
and what we do, the theatre.

05:50.892 --> 05:53.269
She has had one wish,

05:53.395 --> 05:56.105
one prayer, one dream,

05:57.274 --> 05:59.775
to belong to us.

06:00.068 --> 06:02.445
Tonight her dream has come true,

06:02.529 --> 06:06.365
and henceforth
we shall dream the same of her.

06:06.450 --> 06:11.203
Ladies and gentlemen, for distinguished
achievement in the theatre,

06:11.288 --> 06:15.291
the Sarah Siddons Award
to Miss Eve Harrington.

06:39.483 --> 06:40.483
Bravo!

06:55.582 --> 06:59.585
(Addison) Eve.
Eve, the golden girl. The cover girl.

06:59.669 --> 07:04.090
The girl next door, the girl on the moon.
Time has been good to Eve.

07:04.174 --> 07:09.345
Life goes where she goes. She's been
profiled, covered, revealed, reported,

07:09.429 --> 07:12.348
what she eats and what
she wears and whom she knows

07:12.474 --> 07:15.601
and where she was and
when and where she's going.

07:15.685 --> 07:17.520
Eve.

07:17.646 --> 07:20.147
You all know all about Eve.

07:21.149 --> 07:23.692
What can there be to know
that you don't know?

07:24.945 --> 07:27.780
(Karen) When was it? How long?

07:27.864 --> 07:30.533
It seems a lifetime ago.

07:30.617 --> 07:33.285
Lloyd always said that in the theatre
a lifetime was a season

07:33.370 --> 07:35.204
and a season a lifetime.

07:35.288 --> 07:38.999
It's June now. That was early October.

07:40.210 --> 07:42.128
Only last October.

07:44.214 --> 07:47.967
It was a drizzly night.
I remember I asked the taxi to wait.

07:54.516 --> 07:55.975
Where was she?

07:56.059 --> 08:00.729
Strange. I'd become so accustomed
to seeing her there night after night,

08:00.814 --> 08:03.983
I found myself looking for a girl
I'd never spoken to.

08:04.067 --> 08:06.569
Wondering where she was.

08:11.908 --> 08:14.201
Mrs. Richards?

08:15.245 --> 08:17.663
There you are.

08:17.747 --> 08:22.001
It seemed odd, suddenly,
your not being here.

08:22.085 --> 08:25.504
-Why should you think I wouldn't be?
-Why should you be?

08:25.589 --> 08:27.339
Six nights a week for weeks

08:27.424 --> 08:30.259
of watching even Margo Channing
enter and leave a theatre.

08:30.385 --> 08:33.095
-You don't mind my speaking to you?
-Not at all.

08:33.179 --> 08:36.932
I've seen you so often.
It took every bit of courage I could raise.

08:37.017 --> 08:39.602
To speak to just a playwright's wife?

08:39.686 --> 08:42.104
I'm the lowest form of celebrity.

08:42.230 --> 08:46.525
You're Margo Channing's best friend.
You and your husband are always with her.

08:46.610 --> 08:50.446
And Mr. Sampson. What's he like?

08:50.530 --> 08:53.949
Bill Sampson? He's a director.

08:54.034 --> 08:56.285
-He's the best.
-He'll agree with you.

08:56.369 --> 09:01.457
Tell me. What do you do in between
the time Margo goes in and comes out?

09:01.541 --> 09:04.043
Just huddle in that doorway and wait?

09:04.127 --> 09:07.129
Oh, no. I see the play.

09:07.214 --> 09:11.884
You see the play? You've seen
every performance of this play?

09:11.968 --> 09:14.053
Yes.

09:14.137 --> 09:15.471
But don't you find it...

09:15.555 --> 09:18.807
Apart from everything else,
don't you find it expensive?

09:18.934 --> 09:22.061
Standing room doesn't cost much.
I manage.

09:23.980 --> 09:26.315
-I'm gonna take you to Margo.
-Oh, no!

09:26.441 --> 09:30.069
-Oh, yes. She's got to meet you.
-No, I'd be imposing on her.

09:30.153 --> 09:32.238
I'd be just another tongue-tied fan.

09:32.322 --> 09:35.574
There isn't another like you.
There couldn't be.

09:35.659 --> 09:38.410
If I'd known... Some other time.
Looking like this.

09:38.495 --> 09:42.081
You look just fine.
By the way, what's your name?

09:42.165 --> 09:44.250
Eve. Eve Harrington.

09:47.796 --> 09:51.006
-Good evening, Gus.
-Good evening, Mrs. Richards.

09:51.841 --> 09:53.926
-Good night.
-Good night, Gus.

10:13.154 --> 10:15.656
You can breathe it, can't you?

10:16.866 --> 10:19.368
Like some magic perfume.

10:24.624 --> 10:26.959
(laughter from behind the door)

10:27.961 --> 10:30.045
Wait right here. Don't run away.

10:30.130 --> 10:33.465
"If the South had won,
you could write plays about the North."

10:33.550 --> 10:35.884
-Hi.
-Hello!

10:36.011 --> 10:38.804
"I don't think
you can rightly say we lost the war."

10:38.888 --> 10:41.473
"We was more starved out,
you might say."

10:41.558 --> 10:45.561
"I don't understand all these plays
about love-starved Southern women."

10:45.645 --> 10:49.231
"Love is one thing we were
never starved for in the South."

10:49.357 --> 10:51.900
Margo's interview with
a reporter from the South.

10:52.027 --> 10:55.321
When it gets printed, they're
gonna fire on Gettysburg again.

10:55.405 --> 10:59.408
-It was Fort Sumter they fired on.
-I never played Fort Sumter.

11:00.994 --> 11:05.080
Honeychild had a point.
Lloyd, honey, be a playwright with guts.

11:05.165 --> 11:09.501
Write me one about a nice, normal woman
who just shoots her husband.

11:09.586 --> 11:12.087
-You need new girdles.
-Buy some.

11:12.213 --> 11:14.089
-Same size?
-Of course.

11:14.174 --> 11:17.259
I find these wisecracks
increasingly less funny.

11:17.385 --> 11:21.597
-Aged in Wood happens to be a fine play.
-That's my loyal little woman.

11:21.681 --> 11:24.183
The critics thought so.
The audiences think so.

11:24.267 --> 11:27.853
Packed houses, tickets
four months in advance.

11:27.937 --> 11:30.522
I can't see that Lloyd's plays
have hurt you any.

11:30.607 --> 11:34.693
-Easy now.
-Relax, kid, it's just me and my big mouth.

11:34.778 --> 11:37.821
You get me so mad sometimes.

11:37.906 --> 11:40.449
Of all the women
with nothing to complain about...

11:40.533 --> 11:42.701
-Ain't it the truth?
-Yes, it is.

11:42.786 --> 11:45.204
You're talented, famous, wealthy.

11:45.288 --> 11:49.541
People waiting around night after night
just to see you. Even in the rain.

11:49.626 --> 11:52.378
Autograph fiends. They're not people.

11:52.462 --> 11:55.047
Little beasts that run around in packs
like coyotes.

11:55.131 --> 11:57.966
-They're your fans.
-They're nobody's fans.

11:58.093 --> 12:01.887
They're juvenile delinquents.
They're nobody's audience.

12:01.971 --> 12:05.808
They never see a play or a movie.
They're never indoors long enough.

12:05.934 --> 12:09.311
Well, there's one indoors right now.

12:10.313 --> 12:12.898
-I've brought her back to see you.
-You've what?

12:13.316 --> 12:15.818
She's just outside the door.

12:15.944 --> 12:17.903
The heave-ho.

12:17.987 --> 12:20.656
But you can't put her out. I promised.

12:20.740 --> 12:22.699
Margo, you've got to see her.

12:22.784 --> 12:25.494
She worships you.
It's like something out of a book.

12:25.620 --> 12:28.163
That book is out of print.
Those days are gone.

12:28.665 --> 12:31.500
But if you'd only see her.
You're her whole life.

12:31.584 --> 12:35.337
You must have spotted her by now.
She's always there.

12:35.422 --> 12:39.508
Oh, the mousy one with
the trench coat and the funny hat.

12:39.634 --> 12:42.678
How could I miss her?
Every night, every matinee.

12:46.266 --> 12:48.350
Come in, Eve.

12:51.646 --> 12:54.273
-I thought you'd forgotten about me.
-Not at all.

12:54.357 --> 12:56.525
Margo, this is Eve Harrington.

12:56.651 --> 12:59.111
-How do you do, my dear?
-Oh, brother.

12:59.195 --> 13:01.196
-Hello, Miss Channing.
-My husband.

13:01.281 --> 13:03.365
-Hello, Miss Harrington.
-How do you do?

13:03.491 --> 13:06.702
And this is my dear friend
and companion, Miss Birdie Coonan.

13:06.786 --> 13:09.037
-Oh, brother.
-Miss Coonan.

13:09.122 --> 13:11.790
-Oh, brother, what?
-When she gets like this,

13:11.875 --> 13:14.042
she starts playing Hamlet's mother.

13:14.169 --> 13:17.963
I'm sure you must have things
to do in the bathroom, Birdie, dear.

13:18.047 --> 13:21.550
If I haven't, I'll find
something till you get normal.

13:25.138 --> 13:27.806
Won't you sit down, Miss Worthington?

13:27.891 --> 13:28.974
Harrington.

13:29.058 --> 13:32.853
-I'm so sorry. Won't you sit down?
-Thank you.

13:36.316 --> 13:37.399
Would you like a drink?

13:37.484 --> 13:40.235
I was saying how often
you've seen the play.

13:40.320 --> 13:41.820
No, thank you.

13:41.905 --> 13:43.822
Yes, I've seen every performance.

13:43.907 --> 13:48.243
Every performance?
Then am I safe in assuming you like it?

13:48.661 --> 13:53.332
-I'd like anything Miss Channing played in.
-Would you really? How sweet.

13:53.416 --> 13:56.585
I doubt very much that
you'd like her in The Hairy Ape.

13:56.711 --> 13:59.505
Please don't misunderstand me,
Mr. Richards.

13:59.589 --> 14:04.343
I think part of Miss Channing's greatness
lies in her ability to pick the best plays.

14:04.427 --> 14:06.595
Your new play
is for Miss Channing, isn't it?

14:06.679 --> 14:08.597
Of course it is.

14:08.723 --> 14:12.351
-How did you hear about it?
-There was an item in The Times.

14:12.435 --> 14:15.270
I like the title, Footsteps on the Ceiling.

14:15.355 --> 14:17.356
Yes, but let's get back to this one.

14:17.440 --> 14:20.692
-Have you really seen every performance?
-Yes.

14:20.777 --> 14:22.778
Why? I'm curious.

14:22.904 --> 14:28.408
Well, if I didn't come to see the play,
I wouldn't have anywhere else to go.

14:28.576 --> 14:30.369
There are other plays.

14:30.453 --> 14:33.205
Not with you in them. Not by Mr. Richards.

14:33.289 --> 14:36.750
But you must have friends,
a home, family?

14:39.045 --> 14:41.547
Tell us about it, Eve.

14:42.632 --> 14:45.801
-If I only knew how.
-Try.

14:47.303 --> 14:49.471
-Well...
-(door opens)

15:07.824 --> 15:11.076
Well, it started
with the play before this one.

15:11.160 --> 15:13.495
-Remembrance.
-Remembrance.

15:13.580 --> 15:16.582
-Did you see it here in New York?
-San Francisco.

15:17.125 --> 15:20.168
It was the last week. I went one night.

15:20.253 --> 15:23.338
The most important night
of my life, until now.

15:23.423 --> 15:27.509
I found myself going the next night
and the next and the next.

15:27.635 --> 15:29.845
Every performance.

15:29.971 --> 15:33.765
Then, when the show went East,
I went East.

15:34.183 --> 15:38.854
-Eve, why don't you start at the beginning?
-Oh, it couldn't possibly interest you.

15:39.188 --> 15:41.273
Please.

15:41.983 --> 15:46.111
I guess it started back home.
Wisconsin, that is.

15:46.195 --> 15:48.530
It was just Mom and Dad and me.

15:48.656 --> 15:50.407
I was an only child.

15:50.491 --> 15:52.951
I used to make believe a lot
when I was a kid.

15:53.036 --> 15:57.039
Acted out all sorts of things.
What they were isn't important.

15:57.165 --> 16:02.210
But, somehow, acting and make-believe
began to fill up my life more and more.

16:03.004 --> 16:06.048
It got so I couldn't tell
the real from the unreal.

16:06.132 --> 16:09.468
Except that the unreal
seemed more real to me...

16:10.887 --> 16:14.556
-I'm talking a lot of gibberish, aren't I?
-Not at all.

16:15.558 --> 16:20.228
Farmers were poor in those days.
That's what Dad was, a farmer.

16:20.355 --> 16:22.481
I had to help out.

16:22.565 --> 16:30.238
So I quit school, went to Milwaukee,
became a secretary in a brewery.

16:30.323 --> 16:35.577
When you're a secretary in a brewery, it's
hard to make believe you're anything else.

16:35.703 --> 16:37.663
Everything is beer.

16:38.915 --> 16:41.667
It wasn't much fun, but it helped at home.

16:42.418 --> 16:48.090
And there was a little theatre group there,
like a drop of rain on the desert.

16:48.174 --> 16:50.258
That's where I met Eddie.

16:50.343 --> 16:53.261
He was a radio technician.

16:53.346 --> 16:56.056
We played Liliom for three performances.

16:57.225 --> 16:59.685
I was awful.

16:59.769 --> 17:03.355
Then the war came and we got married.

17:03.439 --> 17:05.523
Eddie was in the air force.

17:05.608 --> 17:08.109
They sent him to the South Pacific.

17:09.112 --> 17:12.781
You were with the OWI,
weren't you, Mr. Richards?

17:12.906 --> 17:14.156
That's what Who's Who says.

17:14.909 --> 17:19.287
Well, with Eddie gone,
my life went back to beer.

17:19.372 --> 17:21.623
Except for a letter a week.

17:21.708 --> 17:24.960
One week he wrote me
he had leave coming up.

17:25.086 --> 17:30.382
I'd saved my money and vacation time
and went to San Francisco to meet him.

17:31.718 --> 17:34.302
But Eddie wasn't there.

17:34.429 --> 17:37.305
They forwarded the telegram
from Milwaukee.

17:37.432 --> 17:39.975
The one that came from Washington.

17:40.059 --> 17:42.978
To say that Eddie wasn't coming at all.

17:44.480 --> 17:46.982
That Eddie was dead.

17:52.989 --> 17:55.574
I figured I'd stay in San Francisco.

17:55.658 --> 17:59.119
I was alone.
I couldn't go back without Eddie.

18:00.496 --> 18:03.081
I found a job, and his insurance helped.

18:04.500 --> 18:07.753
And there were theatres in San Francisco.

18:07.837 --> 18:12.507
And then, one night, Margo Channing
came to play in Remembrance,

18:12.592 --> 18:14.676
and I went to see it.

18:17.013 --> 18:18.847
Well...

18:18.973 --> 18:21.099
Here I am.

18:26.689 --> 18:31.276
What a story. Everything but
the bloodhounds snapping at her rear end.

18:31.611 --> 18:36.114
There are some human experiences that
do not take place in a vaudeville house!

18:36.199 --> 18:40.494
And that even a fifth-rate vaudevillian
should understand and respect.

18:41.496 --> 18:46.333
-I want to apologize for Birdie.
-You don't have to apologize for me.

18:49.378 --> 18:54.382
I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings.
It's just my way of talking.

18:54.509 --> 18:57.135
You didn't hurt my feelings, Miss Coonan.

18:57.220 --> 18:59.304
Call me Birdie.

19:00.014 --> 19:02.307
And as for being fifth-rate,

19:02.391 --> 19:06.645
I closed the first half
for eleven years, and you know it.

19:13.236 --> 19:16.154
47 minutes from now my plane takes off
and how do I find you?

19:16.239 --> 19:19.157
-Not ready, looking like a junkyard.
-Thank you so much.

19:19.242 --> 19:22.661
Is it sabotage?
Have you no human consideration?

19:22.745 --> 19:26.581
-Show me a human and I might have.
-Airlines have clocks, even if you don't.

19:26.666 --> 19:29.918
I start shooting a week from Monday.
Zanuck is impatient.

19:30.044 --> 19:32.170
Zanuck, Zanuck!
What are you two? Lovers?

19:32.255 --> 19:35.090
-Only in some ways. You're prettier.
-I'm a junkyard.

19:35.216 --> 19:38.510
-Bill. This is Eve Harrington.
-Hi.

19:38.594 --> 19:43.181
My wonderful junkyard. The mystery
and dreams you find in a junkyard.

19:43.266 --> 19:45.100
Heaven help me.

19:45.226 --> 19:47.269
I love a psychotic.

19:49.063 --> 19:53.024
-Hello. What's your name?
-Eve Harrington.

19:53.109 --> 19:55.694
-You've already met.
-Huh? Where?

19:55.778 --> 19:59.906
-Right here, just a minute ago.
-That's nice.

20:03.286 --> 20:06.121
-You're not going, are you?
-I think I'd better.

20:06.247 --> 20:10.876
It's been... I can hardly find
the words to say how it's been.

20:10.960 --> 20:12.961
No, don't go.

20:13.045 --> 20:18.049
The four of you must have so much to say
to each other with Mr. Sampson leaving.

20:18.968 --> 20:21.386
No, stick around, please.

20:21.470 --> 20:26.725
Tell you what. We'll put Stanislavsky
on his plane, then go somewhere and talk.

20:26.809 --> 20:29.561
Well, if I'm not in the way...

20:29.645 --> 20:31.771
I won't be a minute.

20:35.818 --> 20:37.903
Lloyd, we've got to go.

20:43.159 --> 20:44.826
Good night, Margo.

20:44.952 --> 20:47.829
-I'll call you tomorrow.
-Not too early.

20:51.250 --> 20:55.003
-Good luck, genius.
-Geniuses don't need good luck. I do.

20:56.172 --> 20:59.841
-I'm not worried about you.
-Keep the thought.

21:00.134 --> 21:03.178
Good night, Eve.
I hope I see you again soon.

21:03.262 --> 21:08.266
-I'll be at the old stand tomorrow matinee.
-Not just that way. As a friend.

21:08.351 --> 21:10.435
I'd like that.

21:13.189 --> 21:17.275
-It's been a real pleasure, Eve.
-I hope so, Mr. Richards. Good night.

21:17.360 --> 21:19.694
Good night.

21:19.820 --> 21:21.696
Mrs. Richards?

21:21.864 --> 21:24.699
I'll never forget this night as long as I live.

21:24.825 --> 21:28.203
And I'll never forget you
for making it possible.

21:33.501 --> 21:36.461
(Karen) And I'll never forget you, Eve.

21:36.545 --> 21:39.798
Where were we going that night,
Lloyd and I?

21:39.882 --> 21:42.467
Funny, the things you remember

21:42.551 --> 21:44.386
and the things you don't.

21:53.396 --> 21:56.022
-So you're going to Hollywood?
-Mm-hm.

21:58.234 --> 22:01.236
-Why?
-I just wondered.

22:01.320 --> 22:04.322
-Just wondered what?
-Why?

22:05.074 --> 22:08.535
-Why what?
-Why you have to go out there.

22:09.537 --> 22:13.206
-I don't have to. I want to.
-Is it the money?

22:14.166 --> 22:16.376
80% of it'll go for taxes.

22:16.711 --> 22:21.256
Then why? Why, if you're the most
successful young director in the theatre...

22:21.424 --> 22:23.925
The theatre. The theatre.

22:24.010 --> 22:27.679
What rules say the theatre exists
only within some ugly buildings

22:27.763 --> 22:30.515
crowded into one
square mile of New York City?

22:30.599 --> 22:32.726
Or London, Paris or Vienna?

22:34.770 --> 22:37.355
Listen, Junior, and learn.

22:37.440 --> 22:42.360
Do you wanna know what the theatre is?
A flea circus. Also opera.

22:43.446 --> 22:46.197
Also rodeos, carnivals, ballets,

22:46.282 --> 22:50.535
Indian tribal dances, Punch and Judy,
a one-man band, all theatre.

22:50.619 --> 22:55.623
Wherever there's magic and make-believe
and an audience, there's theatre.

22:56.751 --> 22:59.794
Donald Duck, Ibsen and The Lone Ranger.

22:59.920 --> 23:04.215
Sarah Bernhardt and Poodles Hanneford.
Lunt and Fontanne, Betty Grable.

23:04.300 --> 23:07.427
Rex the Wild Horse, Eleonora Duse,
all theatre.

23:08.054 --> 23:10.972
You don't understand them all.
You don't like them all.

23:11.057 --> 23:12.057
Why should you?

23:12.141 --> 23:16.186
The theatre's for everybody, you included,
but not exclusively.

23:16.270 --> 23:18.897
So, don't approve or disapprove.

23:18.981 --> 23:22.817
It may not be your theatre,
but it's theatre for somebody, somewhere.

23:22.943 --> 23:25.445
I just asked a simple question.

23:26.489 --> 23:29.240
And I shot my mouth off.

23:29.325 --> 23:32.410
Nothing personal, Junior. No offense.

23:32.495 --> 23:37.832
It's just that there's so much bushwa in
this ivory greenroom they call the theatre,

23:37.958 --> 23:40.335
sometimes it gets up around my chin.

23:40.795 --> 23:43.838
But Hollywood.
You mustn't stay out there.

23:44.590 --> 23:47.634
-It's only a one-picture deal.
-So few come back.

23:50.346 --> 23:53.598
I read George Jean Nathan every week.

23:53.682 --> 23:57.102
-Also Addison DeWitt.
-Every day.

23:58.646 --> 24:01.689
-You didn't have to tell me.
-(door opens)

24:01.774 --> 24:03.858
It's the latest thing, one earring.

24:03.943 --> 24:07.946
If it isn't, it's going to be.
I can't find the other one.

24:08.030 --> 24:10.532
Throw that dreary letter away.
It bores me.

24:10.658 --> 24:13.868
-Where do you suppose it could be?
-It'll show up.

24:13.953 --> 24:17.122
Oh, I give up. Look in the wigs.
Maybe it got caught in one.

24:17.206 --> 24:20.041
Real diamonds in a wig.
The world we live in.

24:20.167 --> 24:23.044
-Where's my coat?
-Right where you left it.

24:26.340 --> 24:28.383
The seams.

24:28.884 --> 24:31.886
He can't take his eyes off my legs.

24:31.971 --> 24:34.055
Like a nylon lemon peel.

24:34.140 --> 24:37.308
Byron couldn't have said it
more graciously.

24:37.393 --> 24:39.477
Here we go.

24:40.229 --> 24:42.021
Got any messages?

24:42.106 --> 24:44.149
What do you want me
to tell Tyrone Power?

24:44.233 --> 24:47.569
Just give him my phone number.
I'll tell him myself.

24:48.237 --> 24:50.321
Kill the people.

24:52.074 --> 24:54.576
-You got your key?
-See you at home.

24:59.707 --> 25:03.418
I have a suggestion.
There's really not very much time left.

25:03.544 --> 25:06.254
I mean, you haven't had a minute
alone yet.

25:06.338 --> 25:10.758
And I could take care of everything here
and meet you at the gate with the ticket,

25:10.843 --> 25:12.844
if you'd like.

25:12.928 --> 25:14.846
I think we'd like very much.

25:14.930 --> 25:17.432
-Sure you won't mind?
-Of course not.

25:27.276 --> 25:31.446
-She's quite a girl, this whatshername.
-Eve. I'd forgotten they grew that way.

25:31.572 --> 25:35.617
That lack of pretense, that strange
directness and understanding.

25:35.743 --> 25:38.369
Did she tell you about
the theatre and what it meant?

25:38.454 --> 25:40.872
No, I told her. I sounded off.

25:40.956 --> 25:43.958
All the religions in the world
rolled into one,

25:44.043 --> 25:46.461
and we're gods and goddesses.

25:46.587 --> 25:51.216
Isn’t it silly? Suddenly I've developed
a big, protective feeling toward her.

25:51.300 --> 25:54.052
A lamb loose in our big, stone jungle.

25:59.475 --> 26:03.895
-Take care of yourself out there.
-They have the Indians pretty well in hand.

26:03.979 --> 26:05.146
Bill.

26:05.231 --> 26:08.358
-Don't get stuck on some glamour puss.
-I'll try.

26:08.442 --> 26:12.153
You're not much of a bargain. You're
conceited, thoughtless and messy.

26:12.279 --> 26:17.492
-Everybody can't be Gregory Peck.
-You're a setup for some young babe.

26:17.576 --> 26:20.078
How childish are you gonna get
before you stop it?

26:20.162 --> 26:22.914
I don't wanna be childish.
I'd settle for a few years.

26:22.998 --> 26:25.166
And cut that out right now.

26:25.251 --> 26:28.336
Am I going to lose you, Bill? Am I?

26:28.420 --> 26:30.838
As of this moment, you're six years old.

26:30.965 --> 26:33.675
All ready.

26:49.525 --> 26:51.776
Thanks for your help. Good luck.

26:51.860 --> 26:54.028
Goodbye, Mr. Sampson.

26:54.113 --> 26:57.031
-Knit me a muffler?
-Call me when you get in.

27:12.548 --> 27:14.882
(Bill) Hey, Junior!

27:15.217 --> 27:18.344
Keep your eye on her.
Don't let her get lonely.

27:18.429 --> 27:20.388
She's a loose lamb in a jungle.

27:20.514 --> 27:22.557
Don't worry.

27:36.238 --> 27:41.075
(Margo) That same night, we sent for Eve's
things, her few pitiful possessions.

27:41.201 --> 27:44.704
She moved into the little guest room
on the top floor.

27:47.916 --> 27:50.460
The next three weeks
were out of a fairy tale,

27:50.544 --> 27:53.004
and I was Cinderella in the last act.

27:53.088 --> 27:58.760
Eve became my sister, lawyer, mother,
friend, psychiatrist and cop.

28:00.554 --> 28:02.597
The honeymoon was on.

28:02.890 --> 28:04.599
(inaudible)

28:15.444 --> 28:16.778
(applause)

28:54.775 --> 28:56.150
(cheering)

29:08.831 --> 29:11.332
One more?

29:11.417 --> 29:13.501
From now on it isn't applause,

29:13.585 --> 29:16.921
just something to do
till the aisles get cleared.

29:18.757 --> 29:20.842
What, again?

29:23.679 --> 29:28.141
I could watch you play that last scene
a thousand times, cry every time.

29:28.642 --> 29:32.019
Performance number 1,000 of this one,
if I play it that long,

29:32.146 --> 29:35.481
will take place
in a well-padded booby hatch.

29:38.152 --> 29:42.530
I must say, you can certainly tell
Mr. Sampson's been gone a month.

29:42.614 --> 29:44.699
You certainly can.

29:44.825 --> 29:48.619
Especially if you're me
between now and tomorrow morning.

29:48.704 --> 29:51.956
You bought the new girdles a size smaller.
I can feel it.

29:52.040 --> 29:54.542
Something maybe grew a size larger.

29:54.668 --> 29:58.129
You can get into one of those girdles
and act for two and a half hours.

29:58.213 --> 30:01.841
I couldn't get into the girdle
in two and a half hours.

30:07.681 --> 30:11.225
You haven't noticed my latest bit
of interior decorating.

30:11.310 --> 30:15.062
(Margo) But you've done so much.
What's new?

30:15.147 --> 30:17.648
The curtains. I made them myself.

30:19.735 --> 30:22.570
They're lovely. Aren't they lovely, Birdie?

30:22.696 --> 30:24.071
Adorable.

30:24.198 --> 30:28.326
We now got everything a dressing room
needs except a basketball hoop.

30:28.410 --> 30:30.745
Just because
you can't even work a zipper!

30:30.871 --> 30:34.248
It was very thoughtful of you, Eve.
I appreciate it.

30:34.374 --> 30:37.168
I'll just take this to the wardrobe mistress.

30:37.252 --> 30:39.629
Don't bother.
Mrs. Brown will be along soon.

30:39.713 --> 30:41.589
No trouble at all.

30:47.387 --> 30:50.097
May I be so bold as to say something?

30:50.182 --> 30:53.935
-Have you ever heard of the word "union"?
-Behind in your dues? How much?

30:54.019 --> 30:57.438
-I haven't got a union. I'm slave labor.
-Well?

30:57.564 --> 31:00.691
But the wardrobe women have got one
and, next to a tenor,

31:00.776 --> 31:04.362
a wardrobe woman is the
touchiest thing in show business.

31:04.446 --> 31:05.488
Oh, oh.

31:05.572 --> 31:08.950
She's got two things to do:
carry clothes and press 'em wrong.

31:09.034 --> 31:12.286
And don't let anybody try to muscle in.

31:20.754 --> 31:23.214
Eve.

31:25.968 --> 31:29.303
We'd better let Mrs. Brown
pick up the wardrobe.

31:43.151 --> 31:44.610
(phone rings)

31:57.916 --> 31:59.000
Hello.

31:59.084 --> 32:01.085
We are ready
with your call to Beverly Hills.

32:01.169 --> 32:06.424
-Call? What call?
-Is this Templeton 89970? Miss Channing?

32:06.508 --> 32:08.759
Yes, it is, but I don't understand.

32:08.844 --> 32:12.054
We are ready with the call you placed
for 12 midnight, California time,

32:12.139 --> 32:13.931
to Mr. Sampson.

32:14.016 --> 32:16.851
-I placed?
-Go ahead, please.

32:16.977 --> 32:20.521
(Bill) Margo, what a wonderful surprise.

32:20.647 --> 32:23.941
What a thoughtful, ever-lovin' thing to do.

32:24.026 --> 32:27.612
Bill. Have I gone crazy, Bill?

32:27.696 --> 32:30.364
-You're my girl, aren't you?
-That I am.

32:30.449 --> 32:32.533
Then you're crazy.

32:33.869 --> 32:36.871
-When are you coming back?
-I leave in a week.

32:36.955 --> 32:39.707
The picture's wrapped up.
We previewed last night.

32:39.958 --> 32:42.043
Oh, those previews.

32:42.169 --> 32:46.213
Like opening out of town, but terrifying.
There's nothing you can do.

32:46.340 --> 32:48.466
You're trapped. You're in a tin can.

32:48.967 --> 32:54.221
In a tin can, cellophane or wrapped
in a Navajo blanket, I want you home.

32:54.681 --> 32:59.143
-You in a hurry?
-In a big hurry, so be quick about it.

32:59.853 --> 33:02.146
Goodbye, darling. Sleep tight.

33:02.230 --> 33:05.191
Hey, wait a minute.
You haven't even said it yet.

33:06.068 --> 33:10.237
Oh, now, Bill. You know how much I do,
but over a phone...

33:10.322 --> 33:13.407
Now, really. That's kids' stuff.

33:13.533 --> 33:17.244
Kids' stuff or not. It doesn't happen
every day and I wanna hear it.

33:17.371 --> 33:20.414
-And if you won't say it, you can sing it.
-Sing it?

33:20.540 --> 33:23.417
Sure, like the Western Union boys
used to do.

33:27.589 --> 33:29.715
Bill...

33:30.258 --> 33:32.760
It's your birthday.

33:32.844 --> 33:38.015
And who remembered it?
Who was there on the dot at 12 midnight?

33:38.100 --> 33:40.017
Happy birthday, darling.

33:40.102 --> 33:43.521
The reading could've been better,
but you said it.

33:43.605 --> 33:45.856
Now, "Many happy returns of the day."

33:45.941 --> 33:48.859
Many happy returns of the day.

33:49.778 --> 33:53.948
-I get a party, don't I?
-Of course. Birthday and coming home.

33:54.074 --> 33:57.952
-Who will I ask?
-I know all about the party. Eve wrote me.

34:00.122 --> 34:02.623
-She did?
-She hasn't missed a week since I left.

34:02.749 --> 34:05.459
But you know that.
You probably tell her what to write.

34:05.544 --> 34:08.379
I sent her a list of guests,
so check with her.

34:08.463 --> 34:09.964
Yeah, I will.

34:10.090 --> 34:13.634
-How is Eve? OK?
-OK.

34:13.760 --> 34:16.469
-I love you.
-I'll check with Eve.

34:16.596 --> 34:17.638
Hm?

34:18.264 --> 34:22.059
I love you, too. Good night, darling.

34:22.436 --> 34:24.478
See ya.

35:09.524 --> 35:11.609
-Birdie.
-Hm?

35:12.527 --> 35:14.945
You don't like Eve, do you?

35:15.030 --> 35:17.281
You want an argument or an answer?

35:17.365 --> 35:20.034
-An answer.
-No.

35:20.118 --> 35:22.620
-Why not?
-Now you want an argument.

35:23.705 --> 35:26.874
-She works hard.
-Night and day.

35:26.958 --> 35:31.337
-She's loyal and efficient.
-Like an agent with only one client.

35:33.173 --> 35:35.716
She thinks only of me,

35:36.510 --> 35:38.552
doesn't she?

35:38.678 --> 35:42.139
Well, let's say she thinks
only about ya, anyway.

35:42.224 --> 35:45.226
-How do you mean that?
-I'll tell ya how.

35:46.186 --> 35:47.895
Like...

35:47.979 --> 35:49.980
Like she's studying you.

35:50.065 --> 35:53.234
Like you was a play, or a book,
or a set of blueprints.

35:53.360 --> 35:55.569
How you walk, talk, eat, think...

35:55.654 --> 35:58.739
I'm sure that's flattering.
There's nothing wrong with it.

35:58.824 --> 36:00.366
(knock on door)

36:01.243 --> 36:05.412
Good morning. Well, what do
you think of my elegant new suit?

36:05.539 --> 36:07.915
It looks much better on you
than it did on me.

36:08.041 --> 36:12.837
I can imagine. All it needed was
a little taking in here and letting out there.

36:12.921 --> 36:14.463
Are you sure you won't want it yourself?

36:14.548 --> 36:18.092
Quite sure.
I find it too seventeenish for me.

36:18.176 --> 36:20.511
Come now,
as though you were an old lady.

36:20.595 --> 36:23.097
I'm on my way. Is there anything else?

36:23.181 --> 36:25.599
-That script to take to the Guild.
-I've got it.

36:25.684 --> 36:28.185
And those checks
for the income-tax man.

36:28.270 --> 36:30.396
Right here.

36:30.939 --> 36:34.191
It seems I can't think of a thing
you haven't thought of.

36:34.276 --> 36:37.027
That's my job. See you at teatime.

36:39.614 --> 36:41.031
Eve?

36:41.116 --> 36:46.745
Did you place a call from me to Bill
for midnight California time?

36:47.539 --> 36:51.041
-Golly, I forgot to tell you!
-Yes, dear, you forgot all about it.

36:51.126 --> 36:53.961
I was sure you'd want to,
being his birthday.

36:54.045 --> 36:58.883
You've been so busy lately. Last night
I meant to tell you before you went out.

36:58.967 --> 37:01.552
I guess I was asleep when you got home.

37:01.636 --> 37:04.972
Yes, I guess you were.
It was very thoughtful of you, Eve.

37:05.307 --> 37:09.143
Mr. Sampson's birthday,
I couldn't forget that.

37:09.227 --> 37:10.644
You'd never forgive me.

37:16.985 --> 37:20.613
As a matter of fact,
I sent him a telegram myself.

37:47.515 --> 37:52.102
(Margo) Bill's welcome-home birthday
party, a night to go down in history.

37:52.187 --> 37:56.774
Even before the party started,
I could smell disaster in the air.

37:56.858 --> 38:02.529
I knew it. I sensed it even as I finished
dressing for that blasted party.

38:03.949 --> 38:06.659
-You all put together?
-My back's open.

38:08.036 --> 38:10.704
-Extra help get here?
-There's some characters

38:10.830 --> 38:14.708
dressed as maids and butlers.
Did you call the William Morris Agency?

38:14.793 --> 38:18.045
You're not funny. Actors would cost less.
How about the food?

38:18.171 --> 38:20.798
The caterer had to go back
for the hors d'oeuvres.

38:20.966 --> 38:22.132
Voilà!

38:22.884 --> 38:25.719
That French ventriloquist taught you a lot.

38:25.845 --> 38:28.722
There was nothing he didn't know.

38:33.687 --> 38:35.729
There's a message from the bartender.

38:35.855 --> 38:39.483
"Does Miss Channing know that
she ordered domestic gin by mistake?"

38:39.567 --> 38:42.403
The only thing I ordered
by mistake is the guests.

38:42.487 --> 38:45.489
They don't care what they drink
as long as it burns.

38:45.573 --> 38:48.492
-Where's Bill? He's late.
-Late for what?

38:48.576 --> 38:49.868
Don't be dense. The party.

38:49.953 --> 38:52.830
I ain't dense.
He's been here for 20 minutes.

38:52.914 --> 38:56.917
Well, I certainly think it's odd
he hasn't even come up to...

39:14.519 --> 39:17.187
-(laughter)
-The cameraman said,

39:17.272 --> 39:21.442
"Even DeMille couldn't see anything
looking through the wrong end!" So...

39:21.568 --> 39:24.611
Don't let me kill the point.
Or isn't it a story for grown-ups?

39:24.738 --> 39:27.948
You've heard it. I looked through
the wrong end of the camera.

39:28.033 --> 39:32.119
Remind me to tell you about the time
I looked into the heart of an artichoke.

39:32.245 --> 39:36.707
-I'd like to hear it.
-Some snowy night in front of the fire.

39:36.791 --> 39:39.877
Meanwhile, would you check
about the hors d'oeuvres, Eve?

39:39.961 --> 39:43.297
The caterer forgot them.
The varnish wasn't dry or something.

39:43.381 --> 39:45.466
Of course.

39:56.269 --> 39:58.479
Looks like I'm going to have a fancy party.

39:58.605 --> 40:02.399
-I thought you were going to be late.
-Well, I'm guest of honor.

40:02.484 --> 40:04.568
I had no idea you were even here.

40:04.652 --> 40:07.821
I ran into Eve
and she told me you were dressing.

40:07.906 --> 40:10.407
That's never stopped you before.

40:11.826 --> 40:15.496
She wanted to know about Hollywood.
She seemed so interested...

40:15.580 --> 40:19.666
-She's a girl of so many interests.
-It's a pretty rare quality these days.

40:19.751 --> 40:23.170
-A girl of so many rare qualities.
-So she seems.

40:23.296 --> 40:25.589
So you've pointed out so often.

40:25.673 --> 40:27.674
So many qualities so often.

40:27.801 --> 40:32.096
Her loyalty, efficiency, devotion, warmth
and affection, and so young.

40:32.180 --> 40:34.264
So young and so fair.

40:36.184 --> 40:38.435
I can't believe you're making this up.

40:38.520 --> 40:41.688
It sounds like something
out of an old Clyde Fitch play.

40:41.773 --> 40:45.609
Clyde Fitch, though you may not think so,
was well before my time.

40:45.693 --> 40:48.695
I always deny that
you were in Our American Cousin

40:48.780 --> 40:50.030
the night Lincoln was shot.

40:50.115 --> 40:53.117
-I don't think that's funny.
-Of course it is.

40:53.201 --> 40:55.786
This is all too laughable
to be anything else.

40:55.870 --> 40:58.288
You know what I feel
about your age obsession.

40:58.373 --> 41:01.166
And this getting into a jealous froth

41:01.251 --> 41:03.210
because I spent ten minutes
with a stage-struck kid.

41:03.294 --> 41:05.712
-20!
-30 minutes, 40 minutes. What of it?

41:05.797 --> 41:08.298
Stage-struck.
She's a young lady of qualities.

41:08.383 --> 41:12.386
And I'm fed up with both
the young lady and her qualities.

41:12.470 --> 41:15.889
Studying me as if I were a play
or a blueprint.

41:15.974 --> 41:18.976
How I walk, talk, think, act, sleep.

41:19.060 --> 41:22.896
How can you take offense at a kid
trying to be like her ideal?

41:23.022 --> 41:25.524
Stop calling her a kid.

41:27.360 --> 41:30.821
As it happens, there are
particular aspects of my life

41:30.905 --> 41:35.159
to which I would like to maintain
sole and exclusive rights and privileges.

41:35.410 --> 41:38.495
-For instance, what?
-For instance, you.

41:40.832 --> 41:44.668
This is my cue to take you
in my arms and reassure you.

41:44.752 --> 41:46.587
But I'm not going to. I'm too mad.

41:46.713 --> 41:48.255
-Guilty!
-Mad!

41:48.339 --> 41:51.049
There are certain characteristics
for which you are famous,

41:51.134 --> 41:52.509
on stage and off.

41:52.594 --> 41:57.097
I love you for some and in spite of others.
I haven't let those become too important.

41:57.182 --> 42:01.852
They're part of your equipment for getting
along in what is called "our environment".

42:01.936 --> 42:04.521
You have to keep your teeth sharp,
all right.

42:04.606 --> 42:07.524
But I will not have you
sharpen them on me, or on Eve.

42:07.609 --> 42:12.196
-What about her teeth? Her fangs?
-She hasn't cut them yet and you know it!

42:12.280 --> 42:15.365
So when you start judging
an idealistic, dreamy-eyed kid

42:15.450 --> 42:19.494
by the bar-room, Benzedrine standards
of this megalomaniac society,

42:19.579 --> 42:20.704
I won't have it!

42:20.788 --> 42:24.374
Eve Harrington has never by word,
look, thought or suggestion

42:24.459 --> 42:29.046
indicated anything to me but adoration
for you and happiness at our being in love.

42:29.130 --> 42:30.214
To intimate anything else

42:30.298 --> 42:34.009
spells a paranoiac insecurity
that you should be ashamed of.

42:34.135 --> 42:36.428
Cut. Print it.
What happens in the next reel?

42:36.512 --> 42:39.139
Do I get dragged off to the snake pits?

42:39.224 --> 42:41.308
(Eve) Miss Channing?

42:43.645 --> 42:47.648
The hors d'oeuvres are here.
Is there anything else I can do?

42:51.319 --> 42:55.072
Thank you, Eve. I'd like a martini, very dry.

42:55.156 --> 42:57.282
I'll get it.

42:59.619 --> 43:01.828
-What'll you have?
-A milk shake?

43:02.956 --> 43:05.457
A martini, very dry, please.

43:05.583 --> 43:08.168
(laughter and chatter)

43:09.796 --> 43:12.756
-The party's on the first floor.
-Hi, Bill.

43:12.840 --> 43:15.175
-Hello, Mrs. Richards.
-How are you, dear?

43:15.301 --> 43:18.095
Good evening, Mr. Richards. Mr. Fabian.

43:18.179 --> 43:20.514
-May I have your coat?
-I'll take it up.

43:20.640 --> 43:22.683
-Please.
-Thank you.

43:23.268 --> 43:25.352
-Hi.
-Hi, Margo.

43:25.853 --> 43:28.939
-The house looks lovely.
-I like that girl.

43:29.023 --> 43:31.191
That quality of quiet graciousness.

43:31.276 --> 43:34.111
Among so many quiet qualities.

43:34.195 --> 43:36.113
Shall we?

43:36.489 --> 43:41.368
-It's made me so happy your taking Eve in.
-I'm so happy you're happy.

43:41.494 --> 43:44.955
You haven't been running
a settlement house exactly.

43:45.039 --> 43:46.623
The kid has earned her way.

43:46.708 --> 43:49.376
You had a mixed-up inventory
when she took over.

43:49.502 --> 43:51.795
Merchandise laying all over the shop.

43:51.879 --> 43:55.799
-You mixed Margo up with a five-and-ten.
-Make it Bergdorf Goodman.

43:55.883 --> 43:59.720
Everything on its proper shelf, eh, Max?
All done up in little ribbons.

43:59.846 --> 44:02.806
I could die right now
and nobody'd be confused.

44:02.890 --> 44:05.142
-How about you, Max?
-How about me what?

44:05.226 --> 44:08.395
Suppose you dropped dead.
What about your inventory?

44:08.479 --> 44:12.733
I ain't going to drop dead.
Not with the heat.

44:12.817 --> 44:15.569
This is the most ghoulish conversation.

44:15.695 --> 44:17.821
-Thank you.
-Nothing.

44:17.905 --> 44:19.906
Max! Mon vieux!

44:19.991 --> 44:22.409
Fife!

44:22.493 --> 44:26.913
"The kid" will be down in a minute, unless
you'd like to take her drink up to her.

44:27.040 --> 44:30.834
I can get a fresh one...
Karen, you're a Gibson girl.

44:31.085 --> 44:33.754
The general atmosphere
is very Macbethish.

44:33.838 --> 44:36.923
-What has or is about to happen?
-What is he talking about?

44:37.050 --> 44:40.510
-Macbeth.
-We've seen you like this before.

44:40.595 --> 44:43.096
Is it over or is it just beginning?

44:52.774 --> 44:56.902
Fasten your seat belts.
It's going to be a bumpy night.

44:58.738 --> 45:01.114
-Margo, darling!
-How are you?

45:01.240 --> 45:03.992
Mademoiselle, je vous remercie
pour l'invitation.

45:04.077 --> 45:07.287
Enchantée to you too.

45:07.789 --> 45:11.792
I remember, Addison, crossing you off
my guest list. What are you doing here?

45:11.876 --> 45:16.213
Dear Margo, you were an unforgettable
Peter Pan. You must play it again soon.

45:16.297 --> 45:18.799
-Remember Miss Casswell?
-I do not. How do you do?

45:18.925 --> 45:22.052
-We've never met. Maybe that's why.
-She is an actress.

45:22.136 --> 45:25.472
A graduate of the Copacabana
School of Dramatic Art.

45:26.808 --> 45:28.892
Ah... Eve.

45:28.976 --> 45:32.396
-Good evening, Mr. DeWitt.
-I had no idea you knew each other.

45:32.480 --> 45:35.232
This must be, at long last,
our formal introduction.

45:35.316 --> 45:40.153
-Until now, we've only met in passing.
-That's how you met me. In passing.

45:40.279 --> 45:42.739
Eve, this is an old friend
of Mr. DeWitt's mother.

45:42.824 --> 45:46.243
-Miss Casswell, Miss Harrington.
-How do you do?

45:46.327 --> 45:49.246
I've been wanting you
to meet Eve for the longest time.

45:49.330 --> 45:52.416
Your timidity must have
kept you from mentioning it.

45:52.500 --> 45:55.919
-You know of her interest in the theatre?
-We have that in common.

45:56.003 --> 45:57.921
Then you two must have a long talk.

45:58.005 --> 46:01.007
I'm afraid Mr. DeWitt would find me
boring before too long.

46:01.134 --> 46:04.594
You won't bore him, honey.
You won't even get a chance to talk.

46:04.679 --> 46:06.805
Claudia, come here.

46:08.766 --> 46:11.768
You see that man?
That's Max Fabian, the producer.

46:11.853 --> 46:14.187
Now, go and do yourself some good.

46:14.272 --> 46:17.023
Why do they always look
like unhappy rabbits?

46:17.108 --> 46:20.861
Cos that's what they are.
Now go and make him happier.

46:23.531 --> 46:27.951
Now, don't worry about your little charge.
She'll be in safe hands.

46:38.713 --> 46:40.839
Amen!

46:45.219 --> 46:47.220
("Liebestraum" by Liszt)

47:19.170 --> 47:21.254
(changes to a jaunty tune)

47:23.424 --> 47:27.010
-Liebestraum.
-I just played it.

47:27.094 --> 47:30.347
-Play it again.
-But that was the fourth straight time.

47:30.431 --> 47:32.724
Then this will be five.

47:35.561 --> 47:40.106
Many of your guests are wondering when
they may be permitted to view the body.

47:40.191 --> 47:44.444
-Where has it been laid out?
-It hasn't been laid out.

47:44.529 --> 47:47.781
We haven't finished with the embalming.

47:47.865 --> 47:50.867
As a matter of fact, you're looking at it.

47:50.952 --> 47:53.787
The remains of Margo Channing

47:54.705 --> 47:56.790
sitting up.

47:56.874 --> 48:00.377
It is my last wish to be buried sitting up.

48:00.461 --> 48:02.963
Wouldn't you feel more natural
taking a bow?

48:03.047 --> 48:07.384
You know nothing about feelings,
natural or unnatural.

48:07.468 --> 48:11.137
Your guests were also wondering
whether the music couldn't be

48:11.222 --> 48:14.558
a shade more on the,
shall we say, happier side?

48:14.642 --> 48:16.893
If my guests do not like it here,

48:16.978 --> 48:20.230
I suggest they accompany you
to the nursery

48:20.314 --> 48:24.150
where I'm sure
you will all feel more at home.

48:24.277 --> 48:29.239
Margo, you by any chance haven't got
any bicarbonate of soda in the house?

48:29.323 --> 48:32.659
Poor Max. Heartburn?

48:33.828 --> 48:36.162
It's that Miss Casswell.

48:36.247 --> 48:39.416
I don't see why she hasn't
given Addison heartburn.

48:39.500 --> 48:40.750
No heart to burn.

48:40.835 --> 48:45.171
Everybody has a heart,
except some people.

48:46.257 --> 48:48.508
Of course I've got bicarb.

48:48.593 --> 48:51.094
I've got a box in the pantry.

48:51.178 --> 48:54.764
We'll put your name on it. "Max Fabian."

48:54.849 --> 48:59.269
It will stay there always, just for you.

49:00.354 --> 49:03.773
Let the rest of the world
beat their brains out for a buck.

49:03.858 --> 49:05.942
It's friends that count.

49:06.027 --> 49:10.864
-And I have friends.
-I love you, Max. I really mean it.

49:10.990 --> 49:13.199
I love you.

49:13.326 --> 49:15.619
Come to the pantry.

49:16.287 --> 49:19.372
She loves me like a father.
Also, she's loaded.

49:35.014 --> 49:37.057
There you are, Maxie dear.

49:37.183 --> 49:40.310
One good burp
and you'll be rid of that Miss Casswell.

49:40.394 --> 49:43.980
The situation I'm in ain't the kind
you can belch your way out of.

49:44.065 --> 49:47.484
-I made a promise.
-To Miss Casswell? What?

49:47.568 --> 49:50.236
For an audition
for this part we are replacing.

49:50.363 --> 49:52.405
What's her name? Your sister?

49:52.490 --> 49:54.824
-One?
-No, two, please.

49:54.909 --> 49:57.243
If she can act, she might not be bad.

49:57.370 --> 50:00.497
She looks like she might
burn down a plantation.

50:00.581 --> 50:03.416
Right now, I feel like
there is one burning in me.

50:03.501 --> 50:06.419
-When's the audition?
-A couple of weeks.

50:06.545 --> 50:10.256
Tell you what. Why don't I read with her?

50:10.341 --> 50:14.094
-Would you?
-Anything to help you out, Max.

50:14.178 --> 50:17.180
Now that's cooperation. I appreciate it.

50:17.264 --> 50:21.101
Not at all. And now you
can do me a great favor.

50:21.185 --> 50:23.269
Just name it.

50:23.396 --> 50:26.731
Give Eve Harrington a job in your office.

50:29.485 --> 50:32.946
-(belches)
-You get quick action, don't you?

50:33.072 --> 50:35.949
I wouldn't think of taking
that girl away from you.

50:36.075 --> 50:38.535
You said yourself
my inventory was in shape,

50:38.619 --> 50:40.787
all my merchandise put away.

50:40.913 --> 50:44.457
To keep her here with nothing to do,
I'd be standing in her way.

50:44.583 --> 50:47.460
-And you need her, Max.
-What will she do?

50:47.586 --> 50:50.380
She'd be a great help. She'd read scripts,

50:50.464 --> 50:54.968
interview people you have to see,
get rid of those you don't have to.

50:55.094 --> 50:57.637
You'd be a man of leisure, Maxie.

50:57.763 --> 51:00.140
-Well...
-Think of your health.

51:00.224 --> 51:03.727
More time to relax
in the fresh air at a racetrack.

51:03.811 --> 51:07.397
-I don't think it's such a good idea.
-Promise?

51:07.481 --> 51:09.607
-Promise.
-That's my Max.

51:11.318 --> 51:13.069
Oh, there you both are.

51:13.154 --> 51:15.405
Max, Karen's decided it's time to go.

51:15.489 --> 51:18.074
-Where is she now?
-Up in your room.

51:18.159 --> 51:21.494
If you'll excuse me,
I'll go and tell Miss Casswell.

51:25.332 --> 51:27.834
-Who's left out there?
-Too many.

51:27.960 --> 51:31.421
And, besides, you got a new guest.
A movie star from Hollywood.

51:31.505 --> 51:36.259
Shucks! And I sent
my autograph book to the cleaners.

51:40.264 --> 51:43.099
You disapprove of me
when I'm like this, don't you?

51:43.184 --> 51:47.854
Not exactly. Sometimes, though,
I wish I understood you better.

51:47.980 --> 51:50.482
-When you do, let me in on it.
-I will.

51:52.485 --> 51:56.821
-How's the new one coming?
-The play? Oh, all right, I guess.

51:57.823 --> 52:01.201
Cora. Still a girl of 20?

52:01.327 --> 52:03.369
20-ish. It's not important.

52:03.496 --> 52:06.289
Don't you think it's about time
it became important?

52:06.373 --> 52:09.542
-How do you mean?
-Don't be evasive.

52:09.627 --> 52:12.045
Margo, you haven't got any age.

52:12.171 --> 52:15.799
Miss Channing is ageless.
Spoken like a press agent.

52:15.883 --> 52:18.718
I know what I'm talking about.
They're my plays.

52:18.844 --> 52:20.887
Spoken like an author.

52:21.847 --> 52:25.141
Lloyd, I'm not 20-ish. I'm not 30-ish.

52:25.226 --> 52:28.061
Three months ago I was 40 years old.

52:28.145 --> 52:30.730
40! Four-0.

52:33.484 --> 52:35.276
That slipped out.

52:35.361 --> 52:38.404
I hadn't quite made up my mind
to admit it.

52:40.157 --> 52:44.077
Now I suddenly feel as if
I've taken all my clothes off.

52:47.081 --> 52:50.083
To thousands of people
you're as young as you want.

52:50.167 --> 52:52.919
As young as they want, you mean.

52:53.003 --> 52:56.840
I'm not interested whether thousands
of people think I'm six or 600.

52:56.924 --> 52:59.425
Just one person, isn't that so?

53:02.388 --> 53:04.681
You know what this is all about.

53:04.765 --> 53:07.267
It has little to do with
whether you should play Cora.

53:07.351 --> 53:10.436
It has everything to do with
you having a fight with Bill.

53:10.563 --> 53:13.606
Bill's 32. He looks 32.

53:13.732 --> 53:18.194
He looked it five years ago.
He'll look it 20 years from now.

53:18.279 --> 53:20.405
I hate men.

53:23.075 --> 53:25.869
Don't worry, Lloyd. I'll play your play.

53:25.953 --> 53:30.123
I'll wear rompers and come in
rolling a hoop, if you like.

53:34.128 --> 53:37.922
Who'd show up at this hour?
It's time people went home.

53:40.217 --> 53:42.302
Hold that coat up.

53:43.554 --> 53:44.721
(wolf-whistles)

53:45.306 --> 53:48.641
-Whose is it?
-Some Hollywood movie star.

53:48.726 --> 53:52.061
-Her plane got in late.
-Discouraging, isn't it?

53:52.146 --> 53:55.565
Women with furs like that
where it never even gets cold.

53:55.649 --> 53:57.734
Hollywood.

54:00.237 --> 54:03.823
Tell me, Eve. How are things
going with you? Happy?

54:03.908 --> 54:06.159
There should be a new word for happiness.

54:06.243 --> 54:09.996
Being here with Miss Channing
has been a... I just can't say.

54:10.080 --> 54:13.499
She's been so wonderful,
done so much for me.

54:14.960 --> 54:17.629
Lloyd says Margo compensates for
underplaying on stage

54:17.713 --> 54:20.673
by overplaying reality.

54:21.675 --> 54:25.678
Next to that sable, my new mink
seems like an old bed jacket.

54:25.804 --> 54:31.184
You've done your share, Eve. You've
worked wonders with Margo. Good night.

54:31.310 --> 54:34.103
-Mrs. Richards?
-Karen.

54:34.188 --> 54:36.189
Karen.

54:36.273 --> 54:39.859
Isn’t it awful? I'm about
to ask you for another favor,

54:39.985 --> 54:41.945
after all you've done already.

54:42.029 --> 54:43.947
Nobody's done so much.

54:44.031 --> 54:47.700
Stop thinking of yourself
as one of the hundred neediest cases.

54:47.826 --> 54:51.955
-What is it?
-Miss Channing's affairs are in good shape,

54:52.039 --> 54:55.124
so there isn't enough
to keep me as busy as I should be.

54:55.209 --> 54:58.544
Not that I'd consider anything
that would take me away from her.

54:58.671 --> 55:02.215
But the other day
when Mr. Fabian told Miss Channing

55:02.341 --> 55:06.886
that her understudy was going to have
a baby and they'd have to replace her...

55:06.971 --> 55:11.724
-You wanna be Margo's new understudy?
-I don't let myself think about it even.

55:11.809 --> 55:15.395
But I do know the part so well,
and every bit of the staging,

55:15.479 --> 55:18.398
there'd be no need to break in a new girl.

55:19.525 --> 55:22.235
Suppose I had to go on one night

55:22.319 --> 55:25.571
to an audience that came
to see Margo Channing.

55:25.698 --> 55:29.242
-Oh, no, I couldn't possibly!
-I wouldn't worry too much about that.

55:29.326 --> 55:34.914
Margo just doesn't miss performances.
If she can walk, crawl or roll, she plays.

55:35.040 --> 55:39.502
-The show must go on.
-No, dear. Margo must go on.

55:39.586 --> 55:42.755
I don't see any reason
why you shouldn't be her understudy.

55:42.881 --> 55:46.426
-You think Miss Channing would approve?
-I think she'd cheer.

55:46.552 --> 55:50.888
-But Mr. Richards and Mr. Sampson?
-They'll do as they're told.

55:51.724 --> 55:55.018
Then would you speak
to Mr. Fabian about it?

55:55.102 --> 55:57.895
-Of course.
-You won't forget?

55:58.188 --> 56:00.273
I won't forget.

56:02.609 --> 56:06.446
I seem to be forever
thanking you for something, don't I?

56:14.455 --> 56:17.373
-The bed looks like a dead animal act.
-(Karen chuckles)

56:17.458 --> 56:20.960
-Which one is sable?
-But she just got here.

56:21.045 --> 56:24.630
Well, she's on her way
with half the men in the joint.

56:24.715 --> 56:28.301
-It's only a fur coat.
-What do you expect? Live sable?

56:28.427 --> 56:32.430
Diamond collar, gold sleeves.
You know, picture people.

56:34.058 --> 56:37.393
(Addison) Elder statesmen
of the theatre or cinema

56:37.478 --> 56:41.981
assure the public that actors
and actresses are just plain folks,

56:42.107 --> 56:45.651
ignoring the fact that their greatest
attraction to the public

56:45.778 --> 56:49.405
is their complete lack of resemblance
to normal human beings.

56:49.490 --> 56:52.909
Now there's something
a girl could make sacrifices for.

56:52.993 --> 56:55.495
-And probably has.
-Sable.

56:55.621 --> 56:59.082
-Sable? Did she say sable or Gable?
-Either one.

56:59.166 --> 57:02.335
We all have abnormality in common.

57:02.461 --> 57:06.255
We're a breed apart from the rest
of humanity, we theatre folk.

57:06.340 --> 57:09.592
We are the original
displaced personalities.

57:09.676 --> 57:13.513
You won't have to read his column
tomorrow, Eve. You just heard it.

57:13.639 --> 57:17.934
-I don't agree, Addison.
-That's your particular abnormality.

57:18.018 --> 57:20.770
I admit there's a screwball
element in the theatre.

57:20.854 --> 57:24.941
It sticks out, it's got spotlights
on it and a brass band.

57:25.025 --> 57:30.196
But it isn't basic. It isn't standard.
If it were, the theatre couldn't survive.

57:30.280 --> 57:32.240
Oh, waiter.

57:32.324 --> 57:34.700
That isn't a waiter, my dear.
That's a butler.

57:34.785 --> 57:37.203
Well, I can't yell out "butler", can I?

57:37.287 --> 57:39.872
Maybe somebody's name is Butler.

57:39.957 --> 57:43.543
You have a point.
An idiotic one, but a point.

57:43.669 --> 57:47.630
I don't wanna make trouble.
All I want is a drink.

57:47.714 --> 57:51.509
-Leave it to me. I'll get you one.
-Thank you, Mr. Fabian.

57:52.302 --> 57:57.014
Well done. I can see your career
rising in the east like the sun.

57:59.226 --> 58:03.563
-You were saying?
-The theatre is nine-tenths hard work.

58:04.022 --> 58:08.401
Work done the hard way, by sweat,
application and craftsmanship.

58:08.735 --> 58:12.238
To be a good actor or actress,
or anything in the theatre,

58:12.322 --> 58:15.158
means wanting to be that
more than anything else.

58:15.242 --> 58:17.493
Yes. Yes, it does.

58:17.578 --> 58:21.330
It means a concentration
of desire or ambition and sacrifice

58:21.415 --> 58:23.749
such as no other profession demands.

58:23.834 --> 58:27.670
And the man or woman who accepts
those terms can't be ordinary,

58:27.754 --> 58:29.922
can't be just someone.

58:30.048 --> 58:33.009
To give so much
for almost always so little.

58:33.093 --> 58:35.344
"So little?"

58:35.429 --> 58:37.597
"So little," did you say?

58:38.765 --> 58:42.268
Why, if there's nothing else,
there's applause.

58:42.352 --> 58:45.605
I've listened backstage to people applaud.

58:45.731 --> 58:47.607
It's like...

58:47.733 --> 58:52.612
Like waves of love coming over
the footlights and wrapping you up.

58:52.696 --> 58:58.117
Imagine, to know every night
that different hundreds of people love you.

58:58.202 --> 59:02.371
They smile, their eyes shine,
you've pleased them.

59:02.456 --> 59:05.625
They want you. You belong.

59:07.127 --> 59:10.129
Just that alone is worth anything.

59:23.977 --> 59:28.648
Don't get up. And please stop acting
as if I were the Queen Mother.

59:28.732 --> 59:31.651
-I'm sorry, I didn't...
-Outside of a beehive, Margo,

59:31.777 --> 59:34.904
your behavior
is hardly queenly or motherly.

59:34.988 --> 59:37.073
You're in a beehive, pal.

59:37.157 --> 59:41.827
We're all busy little bees, full of stings,
making honey day and night.

59:41.912 --> 59:43.996
-Aren't we, honey?
-Margo, really.

59:44.331 --> 59:46.999
Please don't play governess, Karen.

59:47.084 --> 59:50.586
I haven't your unyielding good taste.

59:50.671 --> 59:55.341
I wish I could have gone to Radcliffe, too,
but Father wouldn't hear of it.

59:55.425 --> 59:58.177
He needed help behind a notions counter.

59:58.262 --> 01:00:02.348
I'm being rude now, aren't I?
Or should I say, ain't I?

01:00:02.683 --> 01:00:06.435
You're maudlin and full of self-pity.
You're magnificent.

01:00:06.520 --> 01:00:08.938
How about calling it a night?

01:00:09.022 --> 01:00:11.607
And you pose as a playwright.

01:00:11.692 --> 01:00:16.362
A situation pregnant with possibilities,
and all you can think of is "go to sleep."

01:00:16.697 --> 01:00:19.782
-It's a good thought.
-It won't play.

01:00:20.534 --> 01:00:24.787
As a nonprofessional,
I think it's an excellent idea. Excuse me.

01:00:25.539 --> 01:00:28.624
Undramatic, perhaps, but practical.

01:00:28.709 --> 01:00:31.544
-Happy little housewife.
-Cut it out.

01:00:31.670 --> 01:00:36.549
This is my house, not a theatre.
In my house you're a guest, not a director.

01:00:36.675 --> 01:00:40.469
Then stop being a star and treating
your guests as your supporting cast.

01:00:40.554 --> 01:00:43.222
-Let's not get into a big hassle.
-It's time we did.

01:00:43.348 --> 01:00:47.476
Margo has to realize what's attractive
on stage need not be attractive off.

01:00:47.561 --> 01:00:50.062
All right!

01:00:50.188 --> 01:00:52.315
I'm going to bed.

01:00:59.489 --> 01:01:04.076
You be host. It's your party.
Happy birthday. Welcome home.

01:01:04.161 --> 01:01:06.746
And we who are about to die salute you.

01:01:06.872 --> 01:01:08.914
Need any help?

01:01:14.421 --> 01:01:18.382
To put me to bed?
Take my clothes off, hold my head?

01:01:19.259 --> 01:01:22.845
Tuck me in, turn out the lights
and tiptoe out?

01:01:24.556 --> 01:01:26.932
Eve would, wouldn't you, Eve?

01:01:27.059 --> 01:01:29.685
-If you'd like.
-I wouldn't like.

01:01:36.902 --> 01:01:39.779
-Oh, I forgot I had it.
-I didn't.

01:01:47.120 --> 01:01:50.623
Too bad. We're gonna miss the third act.

01:01:50.707 --> 01:01:53.209
They're gonna play it offstage.

01:01:56.213 --> 01:01:58.714
-Coming, Max?
-In a minute.

01:02:01.802 --> 01:02:06.138
Eve, you mustn't mind Margo
too much, even if I do.

01:02:06.264 --> 01:02:09.642
There must be some reason,
something I've done without knowing.

01:02:09.726 --> 01:02:13.646
The reason is Margo and don't try
to figure it out. Einstein couldn't.

01:02:13.730 --> 01:02:16.232
But if I thought I'd offended her,
of all people...

01:02:16.316 --> 01:02:19.819
Eve... I'm fond of Margo, too.

01:02:19.903 --> 01:02:22.029
But I know Margo.
And every now and then,

01:02:22.114 --> 01:02:27.243
there is nothing I wanna do so much
as kick her right square in the pants.

01:02:27.327 --> 01:02:29.912
Well, if she has to pick on someone,

01:02:29.996 --> 01:02:32.498
I'd just as soon it was me.

01:02:35.502 --> 01:02:37.753
-Max is gonna drop us.
-Good night.

01:02:37.838 --> 01:02:40.005
-Good night.
-Good night.

01:02:40.090 --> 01:02:44.927
Mrs. Richards? You won't forget, will you?
What we talked about before?

01:02:45.011 --> 01:02:47.096
No, Eve. I won't forget.

01:03:13.623 --> 01:03:15.541
Why so remote, Addison?

01:03:15.667 --> 01:03:19.211
You should be at the side of
your protégée, lending her moral support.

01:03:19.337 --> 01:03:23.382
Miss Casswell is where I can
lend no support, moral or otherwise.

01:03:23.508 --> 01:03:25.718
In the ladies' shall we say "lounge"?

01:03:25.802 --> 01:03:28.137
Being violently ill to her tummy.

01:03:28.221 --> 01:03:30.639
It's good luck before an audition.

01:03:30.724 --> 01:03:33.893
Miss Casswell got lucky too late.
The audition is over.

01:03:33.977 --> 01:03:37.730
It can't be. I came here to read
with Miss Casswell. I promised Max.

01:03:37.814 --> 01:03:40.316
The audition was at 2.30.
It's now nearly four.

01:03:40.400 --> 01:03:44.153
Is it really? I must start wearing a watch.
I never have, you know.

01:03:44.237 --> 01:03:46.572
Who read with Miss Casswell?

01:03:46.656 --> 01:03:49.241
-Bill? Lloyd?
-No.

01:03:49.367 --> 01:03:53.162
-Well, it can't have been Max. Who?
-Naturally, your understudy.

01:03:53.246 --> 01:03:56.832
It's unnatural to allow a girl
in an advanced state of pregnancy...

01:03:56.917 --> 01:04:01.837
I refer to your new and unpregnant
understudy, Miss Eve Harrington.

01:04:01.922 --> 01:04:04.590
Eve? My understudy?

01:04:04.716 --> 01:04:08.427
-Didn't you know?
-Of course I knew.

01:04:08.553 --> 01:04:10.596
It just slipped your mind?

01:04:14.392 --> 01:04:17.019
How was Miss Casswell?

01:04:17.604 --> 01:04:19.855
Frankly, I don't remember.

01:04:19.940 --> 01:04:22.525
-Just slipped your mind?
-Completely.

01:04:22.609 --> 01:04:25.945
Nor can anyone else present
tell you how Miss Casswell read,

01:04:26.071 --> 01:04:29.031
or whether Miss Casswell read
or rode a pogo stick.

01:04:29.115 --> 01:04:31.367
Was she that bad?

01:04:32.035 --> 01:04:36.038
Margo, I have lived in the theatre
as a Trappist monk lives in his faith.

01:04:36.122 --> 01:04:38.874
I have no other world, no other life.

01:04:38.959 --> 01:04:42.044
Once in a great while,
I experience that moment of revelation

01:04:42.128 --> 01:04:45.214
for which all true believers
wait and pray. You were one.

01:04:45.298 --> 01:04:51.136
Jeanne Eagels another, Paula Wessely,
Hayes. There are others, three or four.

01:04:51.263 --> 01:04:53.556
Eve Harrington will be among them.

01:04:53.640 --> 01:04:55.724
I take it she read well.

01:04:55.809 --> 01:04:58.227
It wasn't a reading, it was a performance.

01:04:58.311 --> 01:05:01.897
Brilliant, vivid,
something made of music and fire.

01:05:01.982 --> 01:05:04.149
How nice.

01:05:04.234 --> 01:05:07.069
In time, she'll be what you are.

01:05:07.153 --> 01:05:09.655
A mass of music and fire.

01:05:10.407 --> 01:05:13.951
That's me.
An old kazoo with some sparklers.

01:05:16.413 --> 01:05:19.999
Tell me, was Bill swept away, too?

01:05:20.125 --> 01:05:22.626
Or were you
too full of revelation to notice?

01:05:22.711 --> 01:05:24.420
Bill didn't say.

01:05:24.504 --> 01:05:27.089
But Lloyd listened to his play

01:05:27.173 --> 01:05:29.508
as if it had been written by someone else,
he said.

01:05:29.593 --> 01:05:32.845
It sounded so fresh,
so new, so full of meaning.

01:05:33.513 --> 01:05:37.850
How nice for Lloyd. How nice for Eve.
How nice for everybody.

01:05:38.476 --> 01:05:42.605
Eve was incredibly modest.
She insisted that no credit was due her.

01:05:42.689 --> 01:05:46.942
That Lloyd felt as he did because she read
his lines exactly as he'd written them.

01:05:47.027 --> 01:05:50.279
The implication being
that I did not read them as written?

01:05:50.363 --> 01:05:54.867
Neither your name nor your performance
entered the conversation.

01:05:54.951 --> 01:05:56.368
(door opens)

01:05:59.831 --> 01:06:03.500
Ah! Feeling better, my dear?

01:06:05.545 --> 01:06:09.965
Like I just swam the English Channel.
Now what?

01:06:10.050 --> 01:06:14.219
Your next move, it seems to me,
should be towards television.

01:06:17.724 --> 01:06:21.560
Tell me this.
Do they have auditions for television?

01:06:21.645 --> 01:06:25.648
That's all television is, my dear.
Nothing but auditions.

01:06:30.403 --> 01:06:32.529
Oh, Margo, darling.

01:06:38.078 --> 01:06:39.119
Mm-hm!

01:06:43.875 --> 01:06:47.836
Terribly sorry I was late.
Lunch was long and I couldn't find a cab.

01:06:47.921 --> 01:06:51.256
-Where's Miss Casswell? Oh, hello, Eve.
-Hello, Miss Channing.

01:06:51.383 --> 01:06:54.009
How are you making out
in Mr. Fabian's office?

01:06:54.094 --> 01:06:57.054
Now, Max, I don't want you
working this child too hard

01:06:57.138 --> 01:06:58.681
just because you promised.

01:06:58.765 --> 01:07:01.850
As you see, I kept my promise, too.

01:07:01.935 --> 01:07:04.269
It's all over.

01:07:04.354 --> 01:07:07.439
-What's all over?
-The audition.

01:07:07.524 --> 01:07:12.194
-Eve read with Miss Casswell.
-Eve? How enchanting.

01:07:12.278 --> 01:07:15.698
How did you get the idea of letting
Eve read with Miss Casswell?

01:07:15.782 --> 01:07:20.035
-Well, she's your understudy.
-Eve? My understudy? I had no idea.

01:07:20.120 --> 01:07:22.371
I thought you knew.
She started a week ago.

01:07:22.455 --> 01:07:24.707
I've never seen her backstage,

01:07:24.791 --> 01:07:28.711
but with so many people loitering about...
Well, well.

01:07:28.795 --> 01:07:31.463
So Eve is not working for Max, after all.

01:07:32.632 --> 01:07:35.134
Max, you sly puss.

01:07:37.303 --> 01:07:42.224
Miss Channing, I can't tell you
how glad I am that you arrived so late.

01:07:42.308 --> 01:07:44.017
Really, Eve? Why?

01:07:44.102 --> 01:07:46.478
Otherwise,
I never would have dared to read.

01:07:46.604 --> 01:07:49.148
-Why not?
-If you'd come in the middle,

01:07:49.232 --> 01:07:51.316
I couldn't have gone on.

01:07:51.401 --> 01:07:55.404
What a pity.
All that fire and music being turned off.

01:07:55.488 --> 01:07:57.990
-What fire and music?
-You wouldn't understand.

01:07:58.116 --> 01:08:00.159
How was Miss Casswell?

01:08:00.285 --> 01:08:02.411
Back to the Copacabana.

01:08:02.495 --> 01:08:05.164
But Eve, Margo. Let me tell you about Eve.

01:08:05.290 --> 01:08:06.999
I was dreadful, Miss Channing.

01:08:07.083 --> 01:08:10.836
I have no right to be anyone's understudy,
much less yours.

01:08:10.962 --> 01:08:13.672
I'm sure you underestimate yourself.
You always do.

01:08:13.757 --> 01:08:15.758
You were about to tell me about Eve.

01:08:15.842 --> 01:08:17.926
-You'd have been proud of her.
-I'm sure.

01:08:18.011 --> 01:08:20.679
-She was a revelation.
-Oh, to you too?

01:08:20.764 --> 01:08:24.099
-What do you mean by that?
-It must have been a revelation

01:08:24.184 --> 01:08:28.103
to have a 24-year-old character
played by a 24-year-old actress.

01:08:28.188 --> 01:08:30.606
-That's beside the point.
-It is the point.

01:08:30.689 --> 01:08:33.024
It must have seemed
so new and fresh to you,

01:08:33.151 --> 01:08:36.444
so exciting, to have your lines
read just as you wrote them.

01:08:36.529 --> 01:08:39.782
-Addison.
-So full of meaning, fire and music.

01:08:41.367 --> 01:08:44.036
You've talked to that
venomous fishwife DeWitt.

01:08:44.162 --> 01:08:46.955
In this case, as trustworthy
as the world almanac.

01:08:47.040 --> 01:08:50.125
You knew when you came in
that Eve was your understudy.

01:08:50.210 --> 01:08:52.711
Playing that childish game
of cat and mouse.

01:08:52.837 --> 01:08:56.048
Not mouse. Never mouse. If anything, rat.

01:08:56.131 --> 01:08:58.884
Your genius for making a bar-room brawl

01:08:58.968 --> 01:09:00.969
out of a perfectly innocent
misunderstanding.

01:09:01.054 --> 01:09:03.805
Perfectly innocent?
Men have been hanged for less.

01:09:03.890 --> 01:09:06.308
I'm lied to, attacked behind my back,

01:09:06.392 --> 01:09:09.560
accused of reading your play
as if it were the holy gospel.

01:09:09.687 --> 01:09:11.479
I never said it was.

01:09:11.564 --> 01:09:15.901
You listen as if someone else had written
your play. Whom do you have in mind?

01:09:16.027 --> 01:09:19.238
Arthur Miller? Sherwood?
Beaumont and Fletcher?

01:09:19.363 --> 01:09:21.865
-May I say a word?
-No!

01:09:22.742 --> 01:09:26.995
You think Miller or Sherwood would stand
for the nonsense I take from you?

01:09:27.080 --> 01:09:31.375
Stick to Beaumont and Fletcher.
They've been dead for 300 years!

01:09:32.167 --> 01:09:35.254
All playwrights should be dead
for 300 years!

01:09:36.089 --> 01:09:40.676
That would solve none of their problems
because actresses never die!

01:09:44.848 --> 01:09:48.392
The stars never die and never change.

01:09:48.725 --> 01:09:51.185
You may change this star
any time you want

01:09:51.270 --> 01:09:55.524
for a new and fresh and exciting one,
fully equipped with fire and music.

01:09:55.608 --> 01:09:59.778
Any time you want,
starting with tonight's performance.

01:09:59.863 --> 01:10:01.947
This is for lawyers to talk about.

01:10:02.031 --> 01:10:05.784
This concerns a contract
that you cannot rewrite or ad-lib.

01:10:05.910 --> 01:10:10.289
Are you threatening me
with legal action, Mr. Fabian?

01:10:10.790 --> 01:10:14.877
-Are you breaking the contract?
-Answer my question.

01:10:14.961 --> 01:10:19.047
-Who am I to threaten? I'm a dying man.
-I don't hear you.

01:10:19.132 --> 01:10:23.051
-I said I'm a dying man!
-Not until the last drugstore

01:10:23.136 --> 01:10:25.888
has sold its last pill.

01:10:25.972 --> 01:10:29.725
I shall never understand the process
by which a body with a voice

01:10:29.809 --> 01:10:32.227
suddenly fancies itself as a mind.

01:10:32.312 --> 01:10:34.813
Just when does an actress decide

01:10:34.939 --> 01:10:38.483
they're her words she's saying
and her thoughts she's expressing?

01:10:38.610 --> 01:10:42.237
Usually at the point
when she has to rewrite and rethink them

01:10:42.322 --> 01:10:44.990
to keep the audience
from leaving the theatre.

01:10:45.074 --> 01:10:49.953
It's about time the piano realized
it has not written the concerto!

01:10:55.001 --> 01:11:01.798
And you, I take it, are the Paderewski
who plays his concerto on me, the piano?

01:11:03.593 --> 01:11:06.178
Where is Princess Fire and Music?

01:11:06.262 --> 01:11:08.764
-Who?
-The kid. Junior.

01:11:14.312 --> 01:11:17.356
-Gone.
-I must have frightened her away.

01:11:17.482 --> 01:11:20.359
I wouldn't be surprised.
Sometimes you frighten me.

01:11:20.485 --> 01:11:23.862
Poor little flower.
Dropped her petals and folded her tent.

01:11:23.988 --> 01:11:27.282
-Don't mix your metaphors.
-I'll mix what I like!

01:11:27.367 --> 01:11:30.535
I'm nothing but a body with a voice.
No mind.

01:11:30.662 --> 01:11:33.121
What a body. What a voice.

01:11:33.873 --> 01:11:37.876
That ex ship-news reporter.
No body, no voice, all mind.

01:11:38.044 --> 01:11:40.921
The gong rang, the fight's over,
calm down.

01:11:41.005 --> 01:11:42.547
I will not calm down.

01:11:42.674 --> 01:11:45.175
Don't calm down.

01:11:47.845 --> 01:11:52.224
-You're being terribly tolerant, aren't you?
-I'm trying terribly hard.

01:11:52.350 --> 01:11:56.812
Well, you needn't be. I will not be
tolerated and I will not be plotted against.

01:11:56.896 --> 01:12:00.148
-Here we go.
-Such nonsense. What do you take me for?

01:12:00.233 --> 01:12:02.109
Little Nell from the country?

01:12:02.193 --> 01:12:04.820
Been my understudy for a week
without me knowing it.

01:12:04.904 --> 01:12:07.990
-Carefully hidden, no doubt.
-Don't get carried away.

01:12:08.074 --> 01:12:11.576
Arrives here for an audition
when everyone knows I will be here,

01:12:11.703 --> 01:12:16.498
-and gives a performance out of nowhere.
-You've been all through that with Lloyd.

01:12:16.582 --> 01:12:20.752
The playwright doesn't make the
performance. It doesn't just happen.

01:12:20.837 --> 01:12:23.755
Full of fire and music and whatnot.

01:12:23.840 --> 01:12:26.258
Carefully rehearsed, I have no doubt.

01:12:26.342 --> 01:12:29.094
Full of those Bill Sampson touches.

01:12:29.178 --> 01:12:32.681
-I am tired of these paranoiac outbursts.
-Paranoiac?

01:12:32.765 --> 01:12:35.851
I didn't know Eve was
your understudy until this afternoon.

01:12:35.935 --> 01:12:37.853
Tell that to Dr. Freud
along with the rest of it.

01:12:37.937 --> 01:12:41.773
No, I'll tell it to you for the last time.

01:12:41.858 --> 01:12:46.361
Cos you've got to stop hurting the two
of us by these paranoiac tantrums.

01:12:46.446 --> 01:12:48.572
That word.
I don't even know what it means.

01:12:48.656 --> 01:12:50.115
It's time you found out.

01:12:50.199 --> 01:12:52.784
-I love you. I love you.
-Hah!

01:12:52.910 --> 01:12:55.954
-You're beautiful and intelligent.
-A body with a voice.

01:12:56.039 --> 01:12:59.791
A beautiful and an intelligent woman,
and a great actress.

01:13:00.918 --> 01:13:05.047
A great actress at the peak of her career.
You have every reason for happiness.

01:13:05.131 --> 01:13:07.049
-Except happiness.
-Every reason.

01:13:07.133 --> 01:13:11.803
But due to some uncontrollable drive,
you permit the slightest action of a kid...

01:13:11.929 --> 01:13:15.807
-A kid!
-...a kid to turn you into a screaming harpy.

01:13:15.933 --> 01:13:18.268
Now, once and for all, stop it.

01:13:36.162 --> 01:13:38.663
It's obvious you're not a woman.

01:13:39.582 --> 01:13:43.668
-I've been aware of that for some time.
-Well, I am.

01:13:43.795 --> 01:13:45.837
I'll say.

01:13:46.339 --> 01:13:48.423
Don't be condescending.

01:13:48.508 --> 01:13:51.009
Come on, get up. I'll buy you a drink.

01:13:51.135 --> 01:13:53.053
I may have seen better days,

01:13:53.137 --> 01:13:56.348
but I'm still not to be had
for the price of a cocktail.

01:13:56.432 --> 01:13:58.517
Like a salted peanut.

01:13:59.644 --> 01:14:04.356
-Margo, let's make peace.
-The terms are too high.

01:14:04.440 --> 01:14:08.860
Just being happy? Just stopping
all this nonsense about Eve?

01:14:08.986 --> 01:14:11.613
-And Eve and me?
-It's not nonsense.

01:14:11.697 --> 01:14:15.992
But if I tell you it is, as I just did,
were you listening to me?

01:14:17.537 --> 01:14:21.373
-Isn’t that enough?
-I wish it were.

01:14:21.499 --> 01:14:24.042
Then what would be enough?

01:14:24.168 --> 01:14:26.461
If we got married?

01:14:26.546 --> 01:14:29.798
I wouldn't want you to marry me
just to prove something.

01:14:29.882 --> 01:14:33.635
You've had so many reasons
for not wanting to marry me.

01:14:34.846 --> 01:14:38.223
Margo, tell me what's behind all this.

01:14:38.307 --> 01:14:40.308
I don't know, Bill.

01:14:40.393 --> 01:14:42.811
It's just a feeling. I don't know.

01:14:42.895 --> 01:14:44.896
I think you do know.

01:14:44.981 --> 01:14:47.691
But you won't or can't tell me.

01:14:49.068 --> 01:14:53.655
I said before it was gonna be
my last try, and I meant it.

01:14:53.739 --> 01:14:57.325
I can't think of anything else to do.
I wish I could.

01:14:58.661 --> 01:15:01.913
We usually wind up screaming
as the curtain comes down.

01:15:02.039 --> 01:15:04.666
Then it comes up again
and everything's fine.

01:15:04.750 --> 01:15:06.877
But not this time.

01:15:08.880 --> 01:15:11.673
No playwright in the world
could make me believe

01:15:11.757 --> 01:15:15.093
this would happen
between two adult people.

01:15:16.429 --> 01:15:18.555
Goodbye, Margo.

01:15:24.604 --> 01:15:26.897
Bill?

01:15:28.566 --> 01:15:31.026
Where are you going?

01:15:31.110 --> 01:15:33.403
To find Eve?

01:15:35.072 --> 01:15:38.617
That suddenly makes
the whole thing believable.

01:15:48.711 --> 01:15:50.212
(sobs)

01:15:56.886 --> 01:15:58.303
(door opens)

01:16:00.932 --> 01:16:02.974
Lloyd.

01:16:03.976 --> 01:16:07.812
-Lloyd, what's happened?
-Up to here, that's where I've got it.

01:16:07.897 --> 01:16:10.649
Of all the star-ridden,
presumptuous, hysterical...

01:16:10.775 --> 01:16:12.651
-Margo again.
-And again and again.

01:16:12.735 --> 01:16:15.904
-Two hours late for the audition.
-That's on time for Margo.

01:16:15.988 --> 01:16:19.908
And then a childish routine about
not knowing Eve was her understudy.

01:16:19.992 --> 01:16:22.327
-It's possible she didn't.
-She knew.

01:16:22.453 --> 01:16:26.498
Addison told her how superbly
Eve had read the part.

01:16:26.582 --> 01:16:30.835
Karen, let me tell you about Eve.
She's got everything. A born actress.

01:16:30.920 --> 01:16:34.256
Sensitive, understanding,
young, exciting...

01:16:34.340 --> 01:16:35.507
You'll run out of adjectives, dear.

01:16:35.633 --> 01:16:39.010
Everything a playwright first thinks
of wanting to write about,

01:16:39.095 --> 01:16:42.097
until his play becomes
a vehicle for Miss Channing.

01:16:42.181 --> 01:16:44.182
Margo hasn't done badly by it.

01:16:44.267 --> 01:16:47.102
Margo's great.
She knows it, that's the trouble.

01:16:47.186 --> 01:16:50.438
She can play Peck's Bad Boy
all she wants and who's to stop her?

01:16:50.523 --> 01:16:54.693
Who's to give her that boot
in the rear she needs and deserves?

01:16:56.153 --> 01:16:58.947
It's gonna be a cozy weekend.

01:16:59.031 --> 01:17:02.117
-What is?
-We're driving to the country tomorrow.

01:17:02.201 --> 01:17:05.537
Just the four of us. Bill, Margo, you and I.

01:17:05.621 --> 01:17:09.457
Well, we've spent weekends
before with nobody talking.

01:17:09.542 --> 01:17:14.170
Just be sure to lock up all blunt
instruments and throwable objects.

01:17:17.300 --> 01:17:18.883
(Karen) Newton, they say,

01:17:18.968 --> 01:17:22.304
thought of gravity
by getting hit on the head by an apple.

01:17:22.388 --> 01:17:24.973
And the man
who invented the steam-engine,

01:17:25.057 --> 01:17:26.891
he was watching a teakettle.

01:17:26.976 --> 01:17:31.646
But not me. My big idea came
to me just sitting on a couch.

01:17:32.732 --> 01:17:36.651
That boot in the rear to Margo.
Heaven knows, she had one coming.

01:17:36.736 --> 01:17:41.072
From me, from Lloyd, from Eve,
Bill, Max and so on.

01:17:41.157 --> 01:17:44.576
We'd all felt those size fives
of hers often enough.

01:17:44.702 --> 01:17:48.246
But how? The answer was
buzzing around me like a fly.

01:17:49.206 --> 01:17:51.249
I had it.

01:17:51.375 --> 01:17:55.587
But I let it go.
Screaming and calling names is one thing,

01:17:55.671 --> 01:17:57.756
but this could mean...

01:17:59.592 --> 01:18:03.928
Why not? "Why," I said to myself, "not?"

01:18:04.013 --> 01:18:06.348
It would all seem perfectly legitimate.

01:18:06.432 --> 01:18:09.184
And only two people in the world
would know.

01:18:09.268 --> 01:18:13.355
Also, the boot would land where it would
do the most good for all concerned.

01:18:13.439 --> 01:18:16.358
After all,
it was no more than a harmless joke

01:18:16.442 --> 01:18:19.527
which Margo herself
would be the first to enjoy.

01:18:19.612 --> 01:18:23.782
And no reason why she shouldn't
be told about it, in time.

01:18:31.791 --> 01:18:36.294
Hello. Will you please call
Miss Eve Harrington to the phone?

01:18:37.713 --> 01:18:39.798
Not at all. I'll wait.

01:18:41.801 --> 01:18:45.553
(Karen) It was a cold weekend,
outside and in.

01:18:45.638 --> 01:18:47.472
Bill didn't come at all.

01:18:47.598 --> 01:18:52.394
Margo didn't know where he was
and didn't care, she kept saying.

01:18:52.478 --> 01:18:54.979
Somehow we staggered through Sunday,

01:18:55.106 --> 01:18:58.900
and by the time we drove Margo
to the station late Monday afternoon,

01:18:58.984 --> 01:19:04.072
she and Lloyd had thawed out
to the extent of being civil to each other.

01:19:04.156 --> 01:19:05.615
What time is it?

01:19:05.699 --> 01:19:08.326
When you asked a minute ago, it was 5.42.

01:19:08.452 --> 01:19:11.579
It is now 5.43.
When you ask again a minute from now...

01:19:11.664 --> 01:19:16.084
I just don't want Margo to miss her train.
As it is, she'll barely make the theatre.

01:19:16.168 --> 01:19:19.921
5.55. We'll be at the station
in plenty of time.

01:19:20.005 --> 01:19:23.758
That little place
"just two hours from New York."

01:19:23.843 --> 01:19:25.760
It's on my list of things
I'll never understand,

01:19:25.845 --> 01:19:29.180
like collecting shrunken Indian heads.

01:19:29.306 --> 01:19:32.684
You should know what it means
to want a little peace and quiet.

01:19:32.810 --> 01:19:35.520
Peace and quiet is for libraries.

01:19:35.646 --> 01:19:37.772
Lloyd. Please.

01:19:37.857 --> 01:19:41.609
Just a little skid, that's all.
This road's like glass.

01:19:41.694 --> 01:19:45.864
-Karen and I just don't want an accident.
-I don't intend to have an accident.

01:19:45.948 --> 01:19:50.201
It isn't important whether you do.
We are wearing long underwear.

01:19:52.371 --> 01:19:54.497
Now what's this?

01:19:59.211 --> 01:20:01.045
(car fails to start)

01:20:10.181 --> 01:20:12.390
But it can't be. We can't be out of gas.

01:20:12.475 --> 01:20:17.145
I filled it myself yesterday. Wasn't it full
when you drove to Brewster this morning?

01:20:17.229 --> 01:20:20.732
I didn't look. You know
I don't pay attention to those things.

01:20:20.858 --> 01:20:22.400
Just incredible.

01:20:22.485 --> 01:20:25.570
-How much time have we got?
-Roughly ten minutes.

01:20:25.696 --> 01:20:28.656
-How far is the station?
-About three or four miles.

01:20:28.741 --> 01:20:33.077
-Any houses where we can borrow gas?
-There's not much along this back road.

01:20:33.162 --> 01:20:36.414
Not many cars either.
Not much chance of a lift.

01:20:36.540 --> 01:20:40.710
No sense in sitting here. I'm gonna
walk up about half a mile, just in case.

01:20:51.388 --> 01:20:53.223
("Liebestraum" by Liszt)

01:20:58.687 --> 01:21:01.439
-You want it on?
-It doesn't matter.

01:21:02.024 --> 01:21:04.275
I detest cheap sentiment.

01:21:05.027 --> 01:21:06.277
(radio off)

01:21:10.616 --> 01:21:13.117
-Karen?
-Mm-hm?

01:21:13.244 --> 01:21:14.369
No, thank you.

01:21:14.453 --> 01:21:19.123
-I haven't been very pleasant this weekend.
-We've all been a little tense lately.

01:21:19.250 --> 01:21:22.168
Come to think of it,
I haven't been very pleasant for weeks.

01:21:22.253 --> 01:21:24.295
For that, I'm truly sorry.

01:21:24.380 --> 01:21:28.299
More than any two people I know, I don't
want you and Lloyd to be angry with me.

01:21:28.425 --> 01:21:32.387
We're never deeply angry.
We just get mad the way you do.

01:21:32.471 --> 01:21:34.556
We know you too well.

01:21:34.640 --> 01:21:37.225
So many people know me.

01:21:37.309 --> 01:21:40.478
I wish I did.
I wish someone would tell me about me.

01:21:40.771 --> 01:21:43.481
You're Margo. Just Margo.

01:21:44.149 --> 01:21:48.987
And what is that? Besides something
spelled out in light bulbs, I mean.

01:21:49.280 --> 01:21:54.867
Besides a temperament, which consists
mostly of swooping about on a broomstick

01:21:54.952 --> 01:21:57.245
and screaming at the top of my voice.

01:21:57.329 --> 01:21:59.831
Infants behave the way I do, you know.

01:21:59.957 --> 01:22:04.335
They carry on and misbehave.
They'd get drunk if they knew how,

01:22:04.420 --> 01:22:07.255
when they can't have what they want.

01:22:07.339 --> 01:22:10.592
When they feel unwanted or insecure or...

01:22:11.468 --> 01:22:13.344
...unloved.

01:22:14.972 --> 01:22:18.349
-What about Bill?
-What about Bill?

01:22:18.475 --> 01:22:20.101
He's in love with you.

01:22:20.185 --> 01:22:25.023
More than anything in this world,
I love Bill. And I want Bill.

01:22:25.107 --> 01:22:27.191
And I want him to want me.

01:22:27.276 --> 01:22:29.360
But me, not Margo Channing.

01:22:30.362 --> 01:22:33.323
And if I can't tell them apart, how can he?

01:22:34.033 --> 01:22:36.534
Well, why should he and why should you?

01:22:36.660 --> 01:22:38.620
Bill's in love with Margo Channing.

01:22:38.704 --> 01:22:41.539
He's fought with her, worked with her,
loved her.

01:22:41.665 --> 01:22:45.960
But ten years from now
Margo Channing will have ceased to exist.

01:22:46.045 --> 01:22:49.672
And what's left will be... What?

01:22:50.716 --> 01:22:54.052
Margo, Bill is all of
eight years younger than you.

01:22:54.136 --> 01:22:59.140
Those years stretch as the years go on.
I've seen it happen too often.

01:22:59.224 --> 01:23:01.476
Not to you, not to Bill.

01:23:01.560 --> 01:23:04.395
Isn’t that what they always say?

01:23:09.234 --> 01:23:12.070
I don't suppose the heater runs
if the motor doesn't.

01:23:12.196 --> 01:23:13.363
Silly, isn't it?

01:23:13.447 --> 01:23:17.742
You'd think they'd fix it so people
could just sit in a car and keep warm.

01:23:18.535 --> 01:23:20.912
About Eve.

01:23:20.996 --> 01:23:24.374
I've acted pretty disgracefully
toward her too.

01:23:25.376 --> 01:23:28.252
-Well...
-Don't fumble for excuses.

01:23:28.379 --> 01:23:31.089
Not here and now with my hair down.

01:23:32.216 --> 01:23:35.927
At best,
let's say I've been oversensitive to...

01:23:36.011 --> 01:23:40.932
Well, to the fact that she's so young,
so feminine and so helpless.

01:23:41.058 --> 01:23:44.268
To so many things I want to be for Bill.

01:23:45.437 --> 01:23:47.146
It's funny, a woman's career.

01:23:47.231 --> 01:23:51.859
The things you drop on your way up
so you can move faster.

01:23:51.944 --> 01:23:55.863
You forget you'll need them again
when you get back to being a woman.

01:23:55.948 --> 01:24:00.868
That's one career all females have
in common, whether we like it or not.

01:24:00.953 --> 01:24:03.037
Being a woman.

01:24:03.122 --> 01:24:05.748
Sooner or later, we've got to work at it.

01:24:06.458 --> 01:24:10.128
No matter how many
other careers we've had or wanted.

01:24:11.547 --> 01:24:15.299
And in the last analysis,
nothing's any good unless you can

01:24:15.384 --> 01:24:17.969
look up just before dinner or

01:24:18.095 --> 01:24:20.722
turn around in bed and there he is.

01:24:20.806 --> 01:24:23.057
Without that, you're not a woman.

01:24:23.142 --> 01:24:28.646
You're something with a French provincial
office or a... A book full of clippings.

01:24:29.982 --> 01:24:32.483
But you're not a woman.

01:24:36.155 --> 01:24:38.489
Slow curtain. The end.

01:24:40.993 --> 01:24:45.830
Margo. Margo, I want you
to know how sorry I am about this.

01:24:46.290 --> 01:24:48.750
-About what?
-This.

01:24:48.834 --> 01:24:51.502
I can't tell you how sorry I am.

01:24:51.628 --> 01:24:54.589
Don't give it a thought.
One of destiny's merry pranks.

01:24:54.673 --> 01:24:59.343
After all, you didn't personally
drain the gasoline tank yourself.

01:25:06.268 --> 01:25:08.519
(Addison) Eve, of course, was superb.

01:25:08.604 --> 01:25:09.771
Many of the audience

01:25:09.855 --> 01:25:13.691
understandably preferred to return
another time to see Margo.

01:25:13.776 --> 01:25:18.279
But those who remained cheered loudly,
lustily and long for Eve.

01:25:18.363 --> 01:25:22.033
How thoughtful of her to call
and invite me that afternoon.

01:25:22.159 --> 01:25:25.536
And what a happy coincidence
that several representatives

01:25:25.621 --> 01:25:28.122
of other newspapers
happened to be present.

01:25:28.207 --> 01:25:30.458
All of us invited that afternoon

01:25:30.542 --> 01:25:33.294
to attend an understudy's performance,

01:25:33.378 --> 01:25:35.213
about which
the management knew nothing

01:25:35.339 --> 01:25:38.883
until they were forced
to ring up the curtain at nine o'clock.

01:25:39.009 --> 01:25:40.384
Coincidence.

01:25:40.511 --> 01:25:42.804
(Bill) You were better than all right.

01:25:42.888 --> 01:25:46.474
You rang a bell. Little things
here and there, but it doesn't matter.

01:25:46.558 --> 01:25:49.143
Be proud of yourself.
You've got a right to be.

01:25:49.228 --> 01:25:51.312
Are you proud of me, Bill?

01:25:51.396 --> 01:25:54.398
I admit I was worried
when Max called. I had my doubts.

01:25:54.691 --> 01:25:58.986
-You shouldn't have had any doubts.
-After all, the other day was one scene.

01:25:59.071 --> 01:26:01.656
The woods
are full of one-scene sensations.

01:26:01.740 --> 01:26:05.576
But you did it. With work and patience,
you'll be a good actress

01:26:05.702 --> 01:26:08.996
-if that's what you wanna be.
-Is that what you want me to be?

01:26:09.081 --> 01:26:13.167
-I'm talking about you and what you want.
-So am I.

01:26:15.087 --> 01:26:18.422
-What have I got to do with it?
-Everything.

01:26:21.009 --> 01:26:25.721
The names I've been called,
but never Svengali. Good luck.

01:26:28.517 --> 01:26:31.185
Don't run away, Bill.

01:26:31.270 --> 01:26:33.771
From what would I be running?

01:26:35.566 --> 01:26:39.443
You're always after truth
on the stage. What about off?

01:26:40.237 --> 01:26:43.573
-I'm for it.
-Then face it. I have.

01:26:43.907 --> 01:26:47.118
Ever since that first night in here.

01:26:47.202 --> 01:26:49.287
I told you
what every actress should know.

01:26:49.413 --> 01:26:53.374
You told me that whatever I became,
it would be because of you.

01:26:53.458 --> 01:26:56.460
-Make-up's a little heavy.
-And for you.

01:26:57.462 --> 01:27:00.464
-You're quite a girl.
-You think?

01:27:00.549 --> 01:27:05.553
-I'm in love with Margo. Hadn't you heard?
-You hear all kinds of things.

01:27:05.637 --> 01:27:09.557
I'm only human, rumors to the contrary,
and I'm as curious as the next man.

01:27:09.641 --> 01:27:12.560
-Find out.
-Only thing:

01:27:12.644 --> 01:27:14.896
what I go after I want to go after.

01:27:14.980 --> 01:27:17.064
I don't want it to come after me.

01:27:23.989 --> 01:27:27.825
Don't cry. Just score it
as an incomplete forward pass.

01:27:47.846 --> 01:27:49.180
(knocking)

01:27:49.932 --> 01:27:52.016
Who is it?

01:27:53.685 --> 01:27:55.811
May I come in?

01:27:56.855 --> 01:27:58.940
Certainly, Mr. DeWitt.

01:28:01.985 --> 01:28:06.113
I expected to find this room
with a theatreful of people at your feet.

01:28:06.198 --> 01:28:10.701
-I'm lucky they didn't throw things.
-Your performance was no surprise to me.

01:28:10.786 --> 01:28:14.205
After the other day, I regarded it
as simply a promise fulfilled.

01:28:14.331 --> 01:28:18.376
You're more than kind. But it's
still Miss Channing's performance.

01:28:18.460 --> 01:28:21.712
I'm the carbon copy you read
when you can't find the original.

01:28:21.838 --> 01:28:27.051
-You're more than modest.
-It's not modesty. I don't try to kid myself.

01:28:27.177 --> 01:28:29.553
A revolutionary approach to the theatre.

01:28:29.638 --> 01:28:34.058
-But if I may make a suggestion...
-Please do.

01:28:34.184 --> 01:28:37.228
I think the time has come
to shed some of your humility.

01:28:37.312 --> 01:28:41.524
It is just as false not to blow your horn
at all as it is to blow it too loudly.

01:28:41.817 --> 01:28:44.652
I don't think I've done anything
to sound off about.

01:28:44.736 --> 01:28:48.823
We come into this world with our little
egos equipped with individual horns.

01:28:48.907 --> 01:28:50.992
If we don't blow them, who else will?

01:28:51.076 --> 01:28:57.498
Even so. One pretty good performance by
an understudy, it'll be forgotten tomorrow.

01:28:58.834 --> 01:29:01.669
It needn't be.

01:29:01.753 --> 01:29:07.425
Even if I wanted to, as you say,
be less humble, blow my own horn,

01:29:08.593 --> 01:29:11.595
how would I do it? I'm less than nobody.

01:29:12.764 --> 01:29:16.183
-I'm somebody.
-You certainly are.

01:29:17.602 --> 01:29:21.230
Leave the door open a bit, so we can talk.

01:29:25.902 --> 01:29:30.448
After you change, if you're not busy
elsewhere, we could have supper.

01:29:30.782 --> 01:29:33.909
I'd love to. Or should I pretend I'm busy?

01:29:34.286 --> 01:29:38.456
Let's have a minimum of pretending.
I shall want to do a column about you.

01:29:38.582 --> 01:29:40.875
I'm not even enough for a paragraph.

01:29:40.959 --> 01:29:42.877
Perhaps more than one.

01:29:42.961 --> 01:29:45.796
There's so much I want to know.
I've heard your story in part.

01:29:45.922 --> 01:29:48.215
Your home in Wisconsin,
your tragic marriage,

01:29:48.300 --> 01:29:50.718
your fanatical attachment to Margo.

01:29:50.802 --> 01:29:53.888
It started in San Francisco, didn't it?

01:29:54.806 --> 01:29:59.226
I say your idolatry of Margo
started in San Francisco, didn't it?

01:29:59.311 --> 01:30:00.478
That's right.

01:30:00.604 --> 01:30:04.482
San Francisco, an oasis of
civilization in the California desert.

01:30:04.608 --> 01:30:08.903
Tell me, do you share
my high opinion of San Francisco?

01:30:08.987 --> 01:30:11.072
Yes, I do.

01:30:11.782 --> 01:30:16.077
And that memorable night when Margo
first dazzled you from the stage,

01:30:16.161 --> 01:30:20.331
what theatre was it in San Francisco?
Was it the Shubert?

01:30:20.415 --> 01:30:22.500
Yes, the Shubert.

01:30:23.085 --> 01:30:26.754
Fine old theatre, the Shubert.
Full of tradition.

01:30:26.838 --> 01:30:30.633
Untouched by the earthquake.
Or should I say fire?

01:30:30.759 --> 01:30:33.511
Tell me, what was your husband's name?

01:30:34.513 --> 01:30:36.597
-Eddie.
-Eddie what?

01:30:40.519 --> 01:30:44.355
I'm about to go into the shower.
I won't be able to hear you.

01:30:44.439 --> 01:30:46.273
Well, it can wait.

01:30:46.358 --> 01:30:49.610
Where would you like to go?
We must make this a special night.

01:30:49.694 --> 01:30:52.947
You take charge.

01:30:53.031 --> 01:30:54.949
I believe I will.

01:31:02.707 --> 01:31:04.375
(shower running)

01:31:09.214 --> 01:31:13.050
(Karen) Some morning papers carried
a squib about Eve's performance.

01:31:13.135 --> 01:31:15.553
Not much, but full of praise.

01:31:15.679 --> 01:31:18.222
I couldn't imagine
how they found out about it.

01:31:18.348 --> 01:31:22.476
But Lloyd said Max's publicity man
probably sent out the story.

01:31:22.561 --> 01:31:25.896
At any rate, I felt terribly guilty
and ashamed of myself

01:31:26.022 --> 01:31:29.400
and wanted nothing so much
as to forget the whole thing.

01:31:29.484 --> 01:31:31.819
Margo and I were having lunch at 21,

01:31:31.903 --> 01:31:34.530
just like girlfriends, with hats on.

01:31:36.575 --> 01:31:38.909
-Has Miss Channing come in?
-Not yet.

01:31:39.035 --> 01:31:41.078
Thank you.

01:31:42.080 --> 01:31:46.500
Oh, Eve! I've heard the most wonderful
things about your performance.

01:31:46.585 --> 01:31:48.961
Relief that I managed
to stagger through it.

01:31:49.045 --> 01:31:50.087
She was magnificent.

01:31:50.172 --> 01:31:52.423
-Then you've heard, too.
-I was there.

01:31:52.507 --> 01:31:55.509
-You were at the play last night?
-A happy coincidence.

01:31:55.594 --> 01:31:59.847
-We're having lunch with a talent scout.
-They certainly don't waste much time.

01:31:59.931 --> 01:32:03.684
-It's nothing definite. Just lunch.
-They'll be wasting their time.

01:32:03.768 --> 01:32:06.854
Eve has no intention
of going to Hollywood.

01:32:06.938 --> 01:32:10.191
By your smart dress,
I take it your companion is a lady?

01:32:10.275 --> 01:32:12.526
-Margo.
-Margo lunching in public?

01:32:12.611 --> 01:32:15.446
It's a new Margo,
but she's just as late as the old one.

01:32:15.572 --> 01:32:18.073
She may be later than you think.

01:32:21.536 --> 01:32:24.288
Why not read my column
to pass the time?

01:32:24.414 --> 01:32:27.208
-The minutes will fly like hours.
-Thank you, Addison.

01:32:27.292 --> 01:32:29.960
Now we must join
our sunburned eager beaver.

01:32:30.045 --> 01:32:32.129
-Goodbye, Karen.
-Goodbye.

01:32:54.986 --> 01:32:57.738
"And so my hat which has,
lo, these many seasons,

01:32:57.822 --> 01:33:01.659
"become firmly rooted about my ears,
is lifted to Miss Harrington.

01:33:01.743 --> 01:33:05.746
"I am available for dancing in the streets
and shouting from the housetops."

01:33:05.830 --> 01:33:09.583
I thought that one went out
with Woollcott. Now listen to this.

01:33:09.668 --> 01:33:14.004
"Miss Harrington had much to tell and
these columns shall report her faithfully

01:33:14.130 --> 01:33:18.008
"about the lamentable practice
in our theatre of permitting

01:33:18.134 --> 01:33:21.011
"mature actresses
to continue playing roles

01:33:21.137 --> 01:33:25.516
"requiring a youth and vigor
of which they retain but a dim memory."

01:33:25.642 --> 01:33:28.769
-I just can't believe it.
-It gets better.

01:33:28.853 --> 01:33:33.357
"About the understandable reluctance
of our entrenched first ladies of the stage

01:33:33.483 --> 01:33:36.277
"to encourage, shall we say,
younger actresses,

01:33:36.361 --> 01:33:39.947
"and Miss Harrington's unsupported
struggle for opportunity."

01:33:40.031 --> 01:33:43.117
-I can't believe Eve said those things.
-In this rat race,

01:33:43.201 --> 01:33:45.953
everybody's guilty till proved innocent.

01:33:46.037 --> 01:33:50.708
One of the differences between
the theatre and civilization.

01:33:50.792 --> 01:33:52.001
What gets me

01:33:52.085 --> 01:33:55.796
is how all the papers happened
to catch that particular performance.

01:33:55.880 --> 01:33:57.965
Lloyd says it's a publicity release.

01:33:58.049 --> 01:34:00.801
The witch
must have sent out Indian Runners,

01:34:00.885 --> 01:34:06.140
snatching critics out of bars, steam rooms
and museums or wherever they hole up.

01:34:06.224 --> 01:34:07.516
She won't get away with it.

01:34:07.600 --> 01:34:09.977
Nor will Addison DeWitt
and his poison pen.

01:34:10.061 --> 01:34:13.731
If Equity or my lawyer can't
or won't do anything about it,

01:34:13.815 --> 01:34:18.777
I shall personally stuff that pathetic little
lost lamb down Mr. DeWitt's ugly throat!

01:34:18.862 --> 01:34:20.237
(footsteps)

01:34:29.748 --> 01:34:34.418
I came as soon as I read that piece of filth.
I ran all the way.

01:34:45.764 --> 01:34:48.182
Bill's here, baby.

01:34:48.266 --> 01:34:50.351
Everything's all right now.

01:34:58.443 --> 01:35:02.112
I guess at this point
I'm what the French call "de trop."

01:35:02.197 --> 01:35:04.907
Maybe just a little around the edges.

01:35:17.629 --> 01:35:21.548
It's Addison from start to finish.
It drips with his brand of venom.

01:35:21.633 --> 01:35:24.301
Taking advantage of a kid,
twisting her words,

01:35:24.386 --> 01:35:27.137
making her say what he wanted her to say.

01:35:27.263 --> 01:35:30.724
-Where did you get all that information?
-Eve.

01:35:30.809 --> 01:35:33.811
-Eve?
-She's been to see me.

01:35:33.937 --> 01:35:37.231
She left just before you came in.
You just missed her.

01:35:37.315 --> 01:35:40.818
-That was a pity.
-Wanted to explain about the interview.

01:35:40.902 --> 01:35:44.655
Wanted to apologize to someone,
and didn't dare face Margo.

01:35:44.781 --> 01:35:48.659
-I wonder why.
-She started talking and couldn't finish.

01:35:48.785 --> 01:35:50.828
She cried so.

01:35:52.414 --> 01:35:56.500
I've been going over our financial position,
if you'll pardon the expression.

01:35:56.626 --> 01:36:01.088
-That's quite a change of subject.
-What with taxes coming up, and,

01:36:01.172 --> 01:36:05.092
since I'm a playwright and not
an oil-well operator, I was thinking...

01:36:05.176 --> 01:36:07.428
I'm trying hard to follow you.

01:36:07.512 --> 01:36:11.265
Instead of waiting until next season
to do Footsteps on the Ceiling,

01:36:11.349 --> 01:36:13.183
which is in pretty good shape,

01:36:13.309 --> 01:36:17.187
and if Margo can be talked into
going on tour with Aged in Wood,

01:36:17.313 --> 01:36:20.441
we could put Footsteps
into production right away.

01:36:20.525 --> 01:36:24.278
-I'm beginning to catch up.
-If we can cast it properly, that is.

01:36:24.362 --> 01:36:26.989
Maybe get some younger actress?

01:36:27.073 --> 01:36:29.199
Someone who'd look the part
as well as play it?

01:36:29.325 --> 01:36:33.954
-You've got to admit, it'd be a novelty.
-Now you're quoting Addison or Eve.

01:36:34.038 --> 01:36:36.457
Eve did mention the play, but in passing.

01:36:36.541 --> 01:36:39.543
She'd never have the nerve
to ask to play a part like Cora.

01:36:39.627 --> 01:36:42.713
Eve would ask Abbott to give her Costello.

01:36:42.839 --> 01:36:46.133
I got the idea myself while
she was talking about the play.

01:36:46.217 --> 01:36:49.052
-With gestures, of course.
-To write something

01:36:49.137 --> 01:36:53.891
and have it realized completely.
For once, not to compromise.

01:36:54.559 --> 01:36:56.435
Lloyd Richards, do not consider

01:36:56.519 --> 01:36:59.146
giving that contemptible little worm
the part of Cora!

01:36:59.230 --> 01:37:04.234
-Now just a minute...
-Margo's not been exactly a compromise.

01:37:04.319 --> 01:37:07.988
Playwrights everywhere would
give their shirts for that compromise.

01:37:08.072 --> 01:37:09.239
Now just a minute...

01:37:09.324 --> 01:37:12.743
Eve's disloyalty and ingratitude
must be contagious.

01:37:12.869 --> 01:37:16.497
All this hysteria because
of an impulsive excited kid

01:37:16.581 --> 01:37:19.500
and a professional
manure-slinger named DeWitt.

01:37:19.584 --> 01:37:23.420
-She apologized, didn't she?
-On her knees, I've no doubt.

01:37:23.546 --> 01:37:26.673
Very touching.
Very Academy of Dramatic Arts.

01:37:26.758 --> 01:37:30.761
That bitter cynicism is something
you've acquired since you left Radcliffe.

01:37:30.887 --> 01:37:35.641
That cynicism I acquired the day I
discovered I was different from little boys.

01:37:35.725 --> 01:37:37.184
(phone rings)

01:37:37.602 --> 01:37:39.269
Hello.

01:37:39.437 --> 01:37:41.772
Oh, hi, Margo.

01:37:42.190 --> 01:37:44.441
No, not at all.

01:37:45.944 --> 01:37:48.695
Karen and I were just chatting.

01:37:48.780 --> 01:37:49.821
Hm?

01:37:51.866 --> 01:37:55.244
Yes, I'm sure we can
and I'm sure we'd love to.

01:37:55.787 --> 01:37:58.455
Right. 11.45ish.

01:38:00.375 --> 01:38:02.459
See you then.

01:38:03.628 --> 01:38:08.966
Margo and Bill want us to meet them
at the Cub Room tonight after the theatre.

01:38:09.050 --> 01:38:11.635
Margo Channing in the Cub Room.

01:38:11.761 --> 01:38:15.222
I couldn't be more surprised
if she'd said Grant's tomb.

01:38:15.306 --> 01:38:19.476
-I'm glad Bill's back.
-They'd die without each other.

01:38:20.478 --> 01:38:23.981
I didn't promise Eve anything.
I said she'd be fine for the part

01:38:24.107 --> 01:38:26.400
but there were practical difficulties.

01:38:26.484 --> 01:38:28.569
-Such as?
-You, for one.

01:38:28.653 --> 01:38:32.823
I told her you wanted Margo to play
the part and I would want your approval.

01:38:32.907 --> 01:38:35.075
That's fine. Fine and dandy.

01:38:35.159 --> 01:38:39.329
Just refer all of Miss Eve Harrington's
future requests to me.

01:38:43.334 --> 01:38:47.921
The so-called art of acting is not one
for which I have a particularly high regard.

01:38:48.006 --> 01:38:51.466
-Hear, hear.
-But you may quote me as follows.

01:38:51.843 --> 01:38:56.096
"Tonight Miss Margo Channing gave
a performance in your cockamamie play,

01:38:56.180 --> 01:39:02.352
"the like of which I have never seen before
and expect rarely to see again."

01:39:02.437 --> 01:39:06.023
-He does not exaggerate. I was good.
-You were great.

01:39:06.107 --> 01:39:11.361
Quite a night. I hear your understudy,
a Miss Harrington, has given her notice.

01:39:11.487 --> 01:39:13.614
-Too bad.
-I'm broken up about it.

01:39:13.698 --> 01:39:16.533
You just can't pick up
champagne and drink it.

01:39:16.659 --> 01:39:19.119
Somebody's got to be
very witty about a toast.

01:39:19.203 --> 01:39:21.288
I shall propose the toast,

01:39:21.372 --> 01:39:24.541
without wit, with all my heart.

01:39:25.543 --> 01:39:27.294
To Margo.

01:39:27.378 --> 01:39:30.505
-To my bride-to-be.
-Glory hallelujah.

01:39:30.715 --> 01:39:32.799
-Margo.
-Drink.

01:39:35.803 --> 01:39:39.806
-When? When are you going to do it?
-Tomorrow we meet at City Hall at ten.

01:39:39.891 --> 01:39:42.643
-And you're going to be on time.
-Yes, sir.

01:39:42.727 --> 01:39:44.978
City Hall, that's for prizefighters
and reporters.

01:39:45.063 --> 01:39:48.065
I see a cathedral, banks of flowers...

01:39:48.191 --> 01:39:52.069
It's only for the license.
There's a three-day wait for blood tests.

01:39:52.153 --> 01:39:55.364
I'll marry you if it turns out
you have no blood at all.

01:39:55.657 --> 01:39:58.575
-What are you going to wear?
-Something simple,

01:39:58.660 --> 01:40:00.661
a fur coat over a nightgown.

01:40:00.745 --> 01:40:05.749
The point is this. In a cathedral,
a ballpark or a penny arcade,

01:40:05.875 --> 01:40:09.753
we want you two beside us,
as our nearest and dearest friends.

01:40:09.879 --> 01:40:13.173
Which we are. Which we'll always be.

01:40:13.257 --> 01:40:18.011
There are very few moments in life
as good as this. Let's remember it.

01:40:18.096 --> 01:40:22.015
To each of us and all of us,
never have we been more close.

01:40:22.100 --> 01:40:24.601
May we never be farther apart.

01:40:27.021 --> 01:40:28.939
-Mrs. Richards?
-Yes.

01:40:29.023 --> 01:40:31.108
-For you.
-Thank you.

01:40:32.276 --> 01:40:35.362
Very indiscreet.
A note in the open like that.

01:40:35.446 --> 01:40:38.699
Next time, tell your lover
to blow smoke rings or tap a glass.

01:40:38.783 --> 01:40:41.118
Lloyd, I want you to be big about this.

01:40:41.202 --> 01:40:44.788
The world is full of love tonight.
No woman is safe.

01:40:44.914 --> 01:40:50.544
Well, this beats all world's records
for running, jumping or standing gall.

01:40:52.213 --> 01:40:55.465
"Forgive my butting in to what
seems such a happy occasion,

01:40:55.550 --> 01:40:57.801
"but it's important that I speak with you.

01:40:57.927 --> 01:41:00.387
"'Please"' and that's underlined,

01:41:00.471 --> 01:41:03.473
"meet me in the ladies' room. Eve."

01:41:04.308 --> 01:41:07.644
I understand she's now
the understudy in there.

01:41:07.770 --> 01:41:10.480
Hand me that empty bottle. I may find her.

01:41:12.734 --> 01:41:15.569
Well, look. There's Rasputin.

01:41:21.242 --> 01:41:22.826
Encore du champagne.

01:41:22.910 --> 01:41:26.580
-More champagne, Miss Channing?
-That's what I said, bub.

01:41:26.664 --> 01:41:28.832
Maybe she just wants to apologize.

01:41:28.916 --> 01:41:31.752
I have no interest in anything she may say.

01:41:31.836 --> 01:41:35.255
But what could she say?
That's what fascinates me.

01:41:35.339 --> 01:41:39.676
-Go on, find out.
-Karen, in all the years of our friendship,

01:41:39.802 --> 01:41:43.346
I have never let you go
to the ladies' room alone.

01:41:43.473 --> 01:41:46.266
Now I must. I am busting to find out

01:41:46.350 --> 01:41:50.854
what's going on in that feverish
little brain waiting in there.

01:41:52.523 --> 01:41:55.650
Well... All right.

01:42:00.698 --> 01:42:02.699
Karen!

01:42:02.825 --> 01:42:04.868
How nice.

01:42:16.380 --> 01:42:19.299
Very effective, but why take it out on me?

01:42:44.367 --> 01:42:46.576
I was wondering
whether you'd come at all.

01:42:46.661 --> 01:42:49.579
Don't get up. And don't act
as if I were the Queen Mother.

01:42:49.705 --> 01:42:51.748
I don't expect you to be pleasant.

01:42:51.874 --> 01:42:54.000
I don't intend to be.

01:42:54.085 --> 01:42:58.088
Can't we sit down just for a minute?
I've got a lot to say and none of its easy.

01:42:58.214 --> 01:43:00.674
-There can't be very much.
-But there is.

01:43:00.758 --> 01:43:04.678
-Easy or not, I won't believe a word of it.
-Why should you?

01:43:05.596 --> 01:43:07.681
Please sit down.

01:43:13.271 --> 01:43:17.023
You know, I've always considered
myself a very clever girl.

01:43:17.108 --> 01:43:20.360
Smart, good head on my shoulders,
that sort of thing.

01:43:20.444 --> 01:43:23.947
Never the wrong word at the wrong time.

01:43:24.031 --> 01:43:26.533
But then I'd never met Addison DeWitt.

01:43:28.870 --> 01:43:31.037
I remember I had a tooth pulled once.

01:43:31.122 --> 01:43:34.374
They gave me some anaesthetic.
I don't remember the name.

01:43:34.458 --> 01:43:36.293
It affected me strangely.

01:43:36.419 --> 01:43:40.130
I found myself saying things
I wasn't even thinking.

01:43:40.214 --> 01:43:44.301
As if my mind was outside of my body
and couldn't control what I did or said.

01:43:44.385 --> 01:43:47.804
-And you felt like that talking to Addison?
-In a way.

01:43:47.889 --> 01:43:50.515
You find yourself
trying to say what you mean,

01:43:50.600 --> 01:43:52.475
but somehow the words change.

01:43:52.560 --> 01:43:54.644
They become his words.

01:43:54.729 --> 01:43:58.982
And suddenly you're not saying
what you mean, but what he means.

01:43:59.108 --> 01:44:01.776
Do you expect me to believe
that you didn't say any of that?

01:44:01.861 --> 01:44:03.486
That they were all Addison?

01:44:03.613 --> 01:44:05.989
I don't expect you to believe anything,

01:44:06.073 --> 01:44:10.160
except that the responsibility
is mine, and the disgrace.

01:44:11.579 --> 01:44:14.080
Let's not get overdramatic.

01:44:15.666 --> 01:44:18.835
You really have a low opinion
of me, haven't you?

01:44:19.670 --> 01:44:22.005
I'll give you some pleasant news.

01:44:22.131 --> 01:44:26.426
I've been told off
in no uncertain terms, all over town.

01:44:26.510 --> 01:44:29.012
Miss Channing should be happy
to hear that.

01:44:29.138 --> 01:44:32.015
To know how loyal her friends are,

01:44:32.141 --> 01:44:36.353
how much more loyal than
she had a right to expect me to be.

01:44:36.437 --> 01:44:39.356
-Eve, don't cry.
-I'm not crying.

01:44:41.192 --> 01:44:45.278
Tell me, how did your luncheon
turn out with the man from Hollywood?

01:44:45.363 --> 01:44:48.114
Some vague promises of a test.

01:44:48.199 --> 01:44:50.617
If a particular part should come along,
one of those things.

01:44:50.701 --> 01:44:55.038
-But the raves about your performance...
-An understudy's performance.

01:44:55.164 --> 01:44:59.960
Well, I think you're painting
the picture a little blacker than it is, really.

01:45:00.044 --> 01:45:04.339
Don't underestimate him.
You have a powerful friend in Addison.

01:45:04.674 --> 01:45:07.217
He's not my friend. You were my friends.

01:45:07.301 --> 01:45:10.220
-He can help you.
-I wish I'd never met him.

01:45:10.304 --> 01:45:12.389
I'd like him to be dead.

01:45:12.473 --> 01:45:14.557
I want my friends back.

01:45:15.476 --> 01:45:20.230
Eve. I don't think
you meant to cause unhappiness.

01:45:20.314 --> 01:45:24.567
But you did. More to yourself perhaps,
as it turned out, than to anyone else.

01:45:24.694 --> 01:45:27.821
-I'll never get over it.
-Oh, yes, you will.

01:45:27.905 --> 01:45:32.492
You theatre people always do.
Nothing is forever in the theatre.

01:45:32.576 --> 01:45:36.913
Whatever it is, it's here, it flares up,
burns hot,

01:45:36.998 --> 01:45:39.082
and it's gone.

01:45:39.583 --> 01:45:43.420
-I wish I could believe that.
-Give yourself time.

01:45:43.504 --> 01:45:46.089
Don't worry too much
about what people think.

01:45:46.173 --> 01:45:48.883
You're very young and very talented.

01:45:50.052 --> 01:45:54.431
And, believe it or not,
if there's anything I can do...

01:45:54.515 --> 01:45:56.933
There is something.

01:45:59.353 --> 01:46:03.940
-I think I know.
-Something most important you can do.

01:46:04.275 --> 01:46:08.570
You wanna play Cora. You want me
to tell Lloyd I think you should play it.

01:46:08.779 --> 01:46:11.865
If you told him so, he'd give me
the part. He said he would.

01:46:11.949 --> 01:46:16.786
After all you've said. Don't you know
that part was written for Margo?

01:46:16.871 --> 01:46:19.622
It might've been 15 years ago.
It's my part now.

01:46:19.749 --> 01:46:25.128
-You talk just as Addison said you did.
-Cora is my part. You've got to tell Lloyd.

01:46:25.463 --> 01:46:27.797
Nothing in the world
will make me say that.

01:46:27.882 --> 01:46:29.632
Addison wants me to play it.

01:46:29.759 --> 01:46:32.886
-Over my dead body.
-That won't be necessary.

01:46:33.262 --> 01:46:36.890
Addison knows how Margo
happened to miss that performance,

01:46:36.974 --> 01:46:42.228
how I happened to know she'd miss it
in time to notify every paper in town.

01:46:42.313 --> 01:46:45.732
It's quite a story.
Addison could make quite a thing of it.

01:46:45.816 --> 01:46:47.942
Imagine how snide
and vicious he could get,

01:46:48.027 --> 01:46:50.153
and still tell nothing but the truth.

01:46:50.321 --> 01:46:52.989
I had a time persuading him.

01:46:54.283 --> 01:46:57.410
You better sit down.
You look a bit wobbly.

01:47:01.832 --> 01:47:06.503
If I play Cora, Addison will never
tell what happened, in or out of print.

01:47:06.629 --> 01:47:09.672
A simple exchange of favors.

01:47:09.799 --> 01:47:13.259
I'm so happy I can do something
for you at long last.

01:47:15.429 --> 01:47:17.597
Your friendship with Margo,

01:47:17.681 --> 01:47:20.308
your deep, close friendship.

01:47:20.684 --> 01:47:22.310
What would happen to it

01:47:22.394 --> 01:47:26.272
if she knew the cheap trick
you played on her for my benefit?

01:47:26.357 --> 01:47:30.151
You and Lloyd, how long,
even in the theatre,

01:47:31.320 --> 01:47:35.490
before people forgot what happened
and trusted you again?

01:47:37.493 --> 01:47:39.202
No.

01:47:40.371 --> 01:47:44.707
It would be so much easier for everyone
concerned if I were to play Cora.

01:47:44.834 --> 01:47:47.335
So much better theatre, too.

01:47:48.170 --> 01:47:50.213
A part in a play.

01:47:51.465 --> 01:47:54.801
You'd do all that just for a part in a play?

01:47:54.885 --> 01:47:57.804
I'd do much more for a part that good.

01:48:21.078 --> 01:48:23.204
Hungry?

01:48:24.999 --> 01:48:28.668
I'm not surprised, after all that humble pie.

01:48:28.752 --> 01:48:32.589
Nothing of the kind.
Karen and I had a nice talk.

01:48:32.673 --> 01:48:34.757
Heart to heart? Woman to woman?

01:48:34.842 --> 01:48:39.512
Including a casual reference to the part
of Cora and your hopes of playing it?

01:48:39.597 --> 01:48:41.764
I discussed it very openly.

01:48:41.849 --> 01:48:44.434
I told her I'd spoken to Lloyd,
and that he was interested.

01:48:44.518 --> 01:48:48.771
And Karen mentioned, of course,
that Margo expects to play the part?

01:48:48.898 --> 01:48:52.692
Oddly enough, she didn't
say a word about Margo.

01:48:52.776 --> 01:48:57.363
Just that she'll be happy to do
what she can to see that I play it.

01:48:58.616 --> 01:49:01.117
Just like that, eh?

01:49:01.243 --> 01:49:03.786
Just like that.

01:49:03.871 --> 01:49:07.749
You know, Eve, sometimes
I think you keep things from me.

01:49:09.084 --> 01:49:12.378
-I don't think that's funny.
-It wasn't meant to be.

01:49:12.463 --> 01:49:16.216
I confide in you and rely on you
more than anyone I've ever known.

01:49:16.300 --> 01:49:19.219
To say a thing like that now,
without any reason,

01:49:19.303 --> 01:49:21.638
when I need you more than ever.

01:49:21.764 --> 01:49:24.307
I hope you mean what you say.

01:49:24.391 --> 01:49:26.893
I intend to hold you to it.

01:49:28.229 --> 01:49:31.314
We have a great deal
in common, it seems to me.

01:49:41.075 --> 01:49:44.827
-Well, what happened?
-Nothing much. She apologized.

01:49:44.954 --> 01:49:46.913
-With tears?
-With tears.

01:49:46.997 --> 01:49:50.917
But not right away. First fight them back,
chin up, stout fellow.

01:49:51.001 --> 01:49:53.503
-Check.
-Very classy. Lots of technique.

01:49:53.587 --> 01:49:58.424
You mean all this time she's done
nothing but apologize? What did you say?

01:49:59.134 --> 01:50:01.177
Not much.

01:50:03.681 --> 01:50:06.599
Groom, may I have a wedding present?

01:50:06.684 --> 01:50:11.104
-What would you like? Texas?
-I want everybody to shut up about Eve.

01:50:11.188 --> 01:50:14.023
Just shut up about Eve. That's all I want.

01:50:14.149 --> 01:50:16.276
Give Karen more wine.

01:50:16.360 --> 01:50:18.444
Never have I been so happy.

01:50:18.529 --> 01:50:21.698
Isn't it a lovely room? The Cub Room.

01:50:21.824 --> 01:50:26.119
What a lovely, clever name.
Where the elite meet.

01:50:26.203 --> 01:50:30.540
Never have I seen so much elite,
all with their eyes on me,

01:50:30.666 --> 01:50:35.128
waiting for me to crack that little
gnome on the noggin with a bottle.

01:50:35.212 --> 01:50:39.632
But not tonight. I'm forgiving tonight.
Even Eve. I forgive Eve.

01:50:40.634 --> 01:50:42.969
There they go.

01:50:44.138 --> 01:50:45.805
There goes Eve.

01:50:45.889 --> 01:50:49.017
Eve Evil, little Miss Evil.

01:50:50.311 --> 01:50:53.229
But "the evil that men do..."
How does that go, groom?

01:50:53.355 --> 01:50:55.815
Something about the good
they leave behind.

01:50:55.899 --> 01:50:58.234
I played it once in rep in Wilkes-Barre.

01:50:58.319 --> 01:51:01.070
You've got it backwards,
even for Wilkes-Barre.

01:51:01.155 --> 01:51:04.824
Do you know why I forgive Eve?
She left good behind.

01:51:05.075 --> 01:51:09.495
The four of us here together,
it's Eve fault. I forgive her.

01:51:10.080 --> 01:51:14.417
And Bill, especially Bill. She did that too.

01:51:14.835 --> 01:51:17.170
You know, she probably
means well after all.

01:51:17.254 --> 01:51:20.715
-She is a louse.
-Never try to outguess Margo.

01:51:21.383 --> 01:51:23.593
-Groom?
-Yes, dear.

01:51:23.719 --> 01:51:26.012
-Do you know what I'm going to be?
-A cowboy?

01:51:26.096 --> 01:51:29.182
-A married lady.
-With a paper to prove it.

01:51:29.266 --> 01:51:33.102
I'm going to look up at six o'clock,
and there he'll be.

01:51:33.771 --> 01:51:36.564
-Remember, Karen?
-I remember.

01:51:37.441 --> 01:51:41.444
-You'll be there, won't you?
-Often enough to keep the franchise.

01:51:41.528 --> 01:51:44.197
No more make-believe, offstage or on.

01:51:44.448 --> 01:51:47.033
Remember, Lloyd? I mean it now.

01:51:47.117 --> 01:51:50.286
Lloyd, will you promise
not to be angry with me?

01:51:50.954 --> 01:51:53.748
-That depends.
-No, I mean deeply angry.

01:51:53.957 --> 01:51:56.209
I don't think I could be.

01:51:56.293 --> 01:51:59.295
Well, I don't want to play Cora.

01:51:59.630 --> 01:52:02.882
-What?
-You're always so touchy about his plays.

01:52:02.966 --> 01:52:07.387
It isn't the part. It's a great part
and a fine play. But not for me anymore.

01:52:07.471 --> 01:52:11.808
Not for a foursquare, upright,
downright, forthright, married lady.

01:52:12.059 --> 01:52:14.394
What's your being married
got to do with it?

01:52:14.478 --> 01:52:17.814
It means I've finally got a life to live.

01:52:17.940 --> 01:52:20.817
I don't have to play parts I'm too old for

01:52:20.943 --> 01:52:24.320
just because I've got
nothing to do with my nights.

01:52:25.239 --> 01:52:27.824
Oh, Lloyd, I'll make it up to you, believe me.

01:52:27.950 --> 01:52:32.829
I'll tour a year with this one, anything.
Only you do understand, don't you?

01:52:39.795 --> 01:52:42.255
-What's so funny?
-Nothing.

01:52:42.673 --> 01:52:46.175
-Nothing?
-Everything. Everything's so funny.

01:52:58.188 --> 01:53:00.857
(Karen) Lloyd never got around to asking

01:53:00.941 --> 01:53:05.027
whether it was all right with me
for Eve to play Cora.

01:53:05.112 --> 01:53:10.199
Bill, oddly enough, refused to direct
the play at first, with Eve in it.

01:53:10.284 --> 01:53:13.035
Lloyd and Max finally won him over.

01:53:13.162 --> 01:53:15.121
Margo never came to rehearsal.

01:53:15.205 --> 01:53:19.208
"Too much to do around the house,"
she said.

01:53:19.334 --> 01:53:23.296
I'd never known Bill and Lloyd
to fight as bitterly and often,

01:53:23.380 --> 01:53:26.048
and always over some business for Eve,

01:53:26.133 --> 01:53:29.552
or a move, or the way she read a speech.

01:53:29.803 --> 01:53:33.556
But I'd never known Lloyd
to meddle as much with Bill's directing,

01:53:33.640 --> 01:53:36.893
as far as it affected Eve, that is.

01:53:37.019 --> 01:53:39.645
Somehow Eve kept them going.

01:53:39.730 --> 01:53:43.232
Bill stuck it out. Lloyd seemed happy.

01:53:47.154 --> 01:53:51.491
And I thought it might be best
if I skipped rehearsals from then on.

01:53:53.202 --> 01:53:57.497
It seemed to me I had known always
that it would happen. And here it was.

01:53:57.581 --> 01:54:02.502
I felt helpless. That helplessness you
feel when you have no talent to offer,

01:54:02.586 --> 01:54:04.837
outside of loving your husband.

01:54:04.922 --> 01:54:08.925
How could I compete?
Everything Lloyd loved about me,

01:54:09.009 --> 01:54:11.093
he'd gotten used to long ago.

01:54:11.178 --> 01:54:12.678
(phone rings)

01:54:16.683 --> 01:54:18.184
Hello?

01:54:18.268 --> 01:54:20.603
Who? Who's calling Mr. Richards?

01:54:20.687 --> 01:54:24.774
My name wouldn't mean anything.
I room across the hall from Eve Harrington.

01:54:24.900 --> 01:54:28.444
She isn't well. She's been crying
all night and she's hysterical.

01:54:28.529 --> 01:54:30.696
She doesn't want a doctor and...

01:54:31.114 --> 01:54:33.199
Who is it? What's it all about?

01:54:33.283 --> 01:54:37.787
-Did Miss Harrington tell you to call?
-Oh, no. Eve didn't say to call him.

01:54:37.913 --> 01:54:41.207
I saw Mr. Richards with her
a couple of times.

01:54:41.291 --> 01:54:43.292
I thought, they being such good friends...

01:54:43.418 --> 01:54:46.546
This is Lloyd Richards.
Where is Eve? Let me talk to her.

01:54:46.630 --> 01:54:49.966
Hello, Mr. Richards.
She's upstairs in her room.

01:54:50.050 --> 01:54:53.803
I really hate to bother you this way,
but the way Eve's been feeling,

01:54:53.929 --> 01:54:57.723
I've been worried sick, what with
her leaving tomorrow for New Haven.

01:54:57.808 --> 01:55:00.893
Tell her not to worry.
Tell her I'll be right over.

01:55:19.454 --> 01:55:22.832
(Addison) To the theatre world,
New Haven, Connecticut,

01:55:22.916 --> 01:55:27.753
is a short stretch of sidewalk between
the Shubert Theatre and the Taft Hotel,

01:55:27.838 --> 01:55:31.340
surrounded by what looks
very much like a small city.

01:55:31.466 --> 01:55:36.429
It is here that managers have
what are called out-of-town openings,

01:55:36.513 --> 01:55:40.808
which are openings for New Yorkers
who want to go out of town.

01:55:41.518 --> 01:55:44.854
What a day. What a heavenly day.

01:55:44.980 --> 01:55:48.024
-D-day.
-Just like it.

01:55:48.150 --> 01:55:50.067
Tomorrow morning,
you will have won your beachhead

01:55:50.152 --> 01:55:52.445
on the shores of immortality.

01:55:52.529 --> 01:55:54.655
Stop rehearsing your column.

01:55:55.616 --> 01:55:57.617
Isn’t it strange, Addison?

01:55:57.701 --> 01:56:01.912
I thought I'd be panic-stricken,
want to run away or something.

01:56:01.997 --> 01:56:06.208
Instead, I can't wait for tonight
to come. To come and go.

01:56:06.376 --> 01:56:08.628
Are you that sure of tomorrow?

01:56:08.712 --> 01:56:11.380
-Aren't you?
-Frankly, yes.

01:56:17.971 --> 01:56:20.056
It'll be a night to remember.

01:56:20.140 --> 01:56:22.892
It'll bring me everything I've ever wanted.

01:56:22.976 --> 01:56:25.645
The end of an old road,
the beginning of a new one.

01:56:25.729 --> 01:56:29.982
-All paved with diamonds and gold?
-You know me better than that.

01:56:30.067 --> 01:56:32.151
Paved with what, then?

01:56:33.070 --> 01:56:35.154
Stars.

01:56:36.239 --> 01:56:38.240
What time?

01:56:38.325 --> 01:56:40.409
Almost four.

01:56:40.994 --> 01:56:43.329
Plenty of time for a nice, long nap.

01:56:43.413 --> 01:56:45.915
We rehearsed most of last night.

01:56:46.041 --> 01:56:48.250
You could sleep now, couldn't you?

01:56:48.335 --> 01:56:51.420
-Why not?
-The mark of a true killer.

01:56:52.381 --> 01:56:55.591
Sleep tight, rest easy
and come out fighting.

01:56:55.676 --> 01:56:58.427
Why did you call me a killer?

01:56:58.512 --> 01:57:02.765
Did I say killer? I meant champion.
I get my boxing terms mixed.

01:57:04.059 --> 01:57:07.436
Addison, come in for a minute, will you?

01:57:07.521 --> 01:57:10.022
I've got something to tell you.

01:57:19.908 --> 01:57:23.202
Suites are for expense accounts.
You're being extravagant.

01:57:23.286 --> 01:57:28.124
Max is paying for it. He and Lloyd
had a terrific row, but Lloyd insisted.

01:57:29.084 --> 01:57:33.879
-Can I fix you a drink?
-With the reluctant compliments of Max?

01:57:33.964 --> 01:57:36.465
Lloyd. I never have any.

01:57:36.550 --> 01:57:39.802
He likes a few drinks after we finish,
so he sent it up.

01:57:39.928 --> 01:57:43.973
Some plain soda. Lloyd must be
expecting a record run in New Haven.

01:57:44.099 --> 01:57:47.560
That's for tonight. You're invited.

01:57:47.644 --> 01:57:50.896
We're having everyone up
after the performance.

01:57:50.981 --> 01:57:52.982
"We are?"

01:57:53.108 --> 01:57:55.151
Lloyd and I.

01:57:56.403 --> 01:57:59.321
I find it odd that Karen
isn't here for the opening.

01:57:59.406 --> 01:58:01.991
-Addison...
-She was always so devoted to Lloyd.

01:58:02.075 --> 01:58:04.285
One would think only death
could keep her...

01:58:04.369 --> 01:58:05.828
Addison.

01:58:05.954 --> 01:58:12.501
I said this would be a night to remember,
that it would bring me all I ever wanted.

01:58:12.586 --> 01:58:14.378
Oh, yes.
Something about an old road ending

01:58:14.463 --> 01:58:17.173
and a new one starting,
all paved with stars.

01:58:17.299 --> 01:58:19.842
I didn't mean just the theatre.

01:58:19.926 --> 01:58:22.011
What else?

01:58:24.765 --> 01:58:27.308
Lloyd Richards.

01:58:27.684 --> 01:58:31.312
He's going to leave Karen.
We're going to be married.

01:58:32.647 --> 01:58:35.608
So that's it. Lloyd.

01:58:35.692 --> 01:58:38.444
Still just the theatre, after all.

01:58:38.528 --> 01:58:40.529
It's nothing of the kind.

01:58:40.614 --> 01:58:42.823
Lloyd loves me. I love him.

01:58:43.033 --> 01:58:44.742
I know nothing of Lloyd's loves.

01:58:44.826 --> 01:58:47.369
I leave those to Louisa May Alcott.
But I know you.

01:58:47.496 --> 01:58:49.205
I'm in love with Lloyd.

01:58:49.289 --> 01:58:52.374
He is a commercially
successful playwright.

01:58:52.709 --> 01:58:56.295
-You have no right to say that.
-And, artistically, very promising.

01:58:56.379 --> 01:58:58.672
Eve, dear, this is Addison.

01:59:00.967 --> 01:59:03.219
Oh, Addison, won't it be just perfect?

01:59:03.303 --> 01:59:06.806
Lloyd and I.
There's no telling how far we can go.

01:59:06.890 --> 01:59:10.476
He'll write great plays for me.
I'll make them great.

01:59:10.560 --> 01:59:13.479
You're the only one who knows,
except Lloyd and me.

01:59:13.563 --> 01:59:15.648
-And Karen.
-She doesn't know.

01:59:15.732 --> 01:59:18.734
-She knows enough not to be here.
-But not all of it.

01:59:18.860 --> 01:59:21.987
-Not that Lloyd and I are gonna be married.
-I see.

01:59:22.405 --> 01:59:25.741
And when was this unholy alliance joined?

01:59:25.826 --> 01:59:29.328
We decided night before last,
before we came up here.

01:59:29.412 --> 01:59:32.665
I trust the setting was properly romantic.

01:59:32.749 --> 01:59:36.418
Lights on dimmers
and gypsy violins offstage.

01:59:36.545 --> 01:59:38.921
The setting wasn't romantic,

01:59:39.047 --> 01:59:41.090
but Lloyd was.

01:59:41.174 --> 01:59:44.510
He woke me up at three o'clock
in the morning, banging on my door.

01:59:44.594 --> 01:59:48.097
He couldn't sleep, he said. He'd left Karen.

01:59:48.223 --> 01:59:52.768
Couldn't go on with the play or anything
else until I promised to marry him.

01:59:52.853 --> 01:59:55.771
We sat and talked until it was light.

01:59:55.856 --> 01:59:58.190
He never went home.

01:59:58.275 --> 02:00:02.695
-You sat and talked until it was light?
-We sat and talked, Addison.

02:00:03.697 --> 02:00:06.240
I want a run-of-the-play contract.

02:00:07.868 --> 02:00:12.037
There never was, and there
never will be, another like you.

02:00:13.290 --> 02:00:15.624
Well, say something. Anything.

02:00:15.709 --> 02:00:18.377
Congratulations. Skål. Good work, Eve.

02:00:25.260 --> 02:00:27.344
What do you take me for?

02:00:27.429 --> 02:00:29.972
I don't know
that I "take you" for anything.

02:00:30.056 --> 02:00:33.225
Is it possible that you've confused me

02:00:33.310 --> 02:00:36.478
with those backward children
you've played tricks on?

02:00:36.563 --> 02:00:39.398
That you have the same contempt
for me as for them?

02:00:39.482 --> 02:00:42.151
I'm sure you mean something,
but I don't know what.

02:00:42.277 --> 02:00:44.820
Look closely, Eve. It's time you did.

02:00:45.322 --> 02:00:49.950
I am Addison DeWitt.
I'm nobody's fool, least of all yours.

02:00:50.243 --> 02:00:54.413
-I never intended you to be.
-Yes, you did, and you still do.

02:00:54.497 --> 02:00:58.167
I don't know what you mean.
But I want to take my nap. It's important...

02:00:58.251 --> 02:01:02.087
-It's important that we talk, killer to killer.
-Champion to champion.

02:01:02.172 --> 02:01:05.174
Not with me, you're no champion.
You're stepping up.

02:01:05.258 --> 02:01:07.968
Please say what you have to say,
plainly and distinctly,

02:01:08.053 --> 02:01:09.595
and then let me take my nap.

02:01:09.679 --> 02:01:15.517
Very well. Although it's unnecessary,
because you know what I'm going to say.

02:01:15.602 --> 02:01:19.438
Lloyd may leave Karen,
but he will not leave Karen for you.

02:01:19.522 --> 02:01:23.859
-What do you mean by that?
-More plainly and more distinctly?

02:01:23.944 --> 02:01:27.529
I have not come to New Haven
to see the play, discuss your dreams,

02:01:27.656 --> 02:01:30.449
or pull the ivy from the walls of Yale.

02:01:30.533 --> 02:01:34.286
I came to tell you that you will
not marry Lloyd, or anyone else,

02:01:34.371 --> 02:01:36.455
because I will not permit it.

02:01:36.539 --> 02:01:39.166
-What have you got to do with it?
-Everything.

02:01:39.501 --> 02:01:42.878
Because after tonight
you will belong to me.

02:01:42.963 --> 02:01:46.382
Belong? To you?

02:01:47.342 --> 02:01:49.385
I can't believe my ears.

02:01:49.511 --> 02:01:51.470
A dull cliché.

02:01:51.554 --> 02:01:53.722
"Belong" to you?

02:01:53.807 --> 02:01:57.059
That sounds medieval.
Something out of an old melodrama.

02:01:57.143 --> 02:02:00.312
So does the history of the world
for the past 20 years.

02:02:00.397 --> 02:02:02.481
I don't enjoy putting it this bluntly.

02:02:02.565 --> 02:02:06.068
I'd hoped that you would have
taken it for granted that you and I...

02:02:06.194 --> 02:02:08.237
"Taken it for granted?"

02:02:08.363 --> 02:02:10.406
"That you and I...?"

02:02:15.495 --> 02:02:18.664
Now remember, as long as you live,
never to laugh at me.

02:02:18.748 --> 02:02:21.750
At anything or anyone else,
but never at me.

02:02:25.255 --> 02:02:29.174
-Get out.
-You're too short for that gesture.

02:02:29.259 --> 02:02:31.760
Besides, it went out with Mrs. Fiske.

02:02:32.929 --> 02:02:36.098
Then if you won't get out,
I'll have you thrown out.

02:02:36.182 --> 02:02:39.184
Don't pick up that phone.
Don't even touch it.

02:02:39.269 --> 02:02:41.770
Something told you to do
what I said, didn't it?

02:02:41.855 --> 02:02:45.691
That instinct is worth millions.
You can't buy it, Eve. Cherish it.

02:02:45.775 --> 02:02:49.236
When that alarm goes off,
go to your battle stations.

02:02:50.447 --> 02:02:55.117
To begin with, your name is not Eve
Harrington. It's Gertrude Slescynski.

02:02:55.201 --> 02:02:56.326
What of it?

02:02:56.411 --> 02:02:59.038
True, your parents were poor,
and still are.

02:02:59.122 --> 02:03:01.373
They would like to know how you are.

02:03:01.458 --> 02:03:03.876
They haven't heard from you
for three years.

02:03:03.960 --> 02:03:06.045
What of it?

02:03:06.713 --> 02:03:08.797
A matter of opinion, granted.

02:03:08.923 --> 02:03:11.383
It's also true you worked in a brewery.

02:03:11.468 --> 02:03:15.137
But life there was not as dull
as you pictured it.

02:03:15.221 --> 02:03:20.059
It got less and less dull, until your boss's
wife had your boss followed by detectives.

02:03:20.143 --> 02:03:24.063
-She never proved a thing!
-But the $500 you got to get out of town

02:03:24.147 --> 02:03:27.399
brought you straight to New York,
didn't it?

02:03:35.658 --> 02:03:38.327
That $500 brought you
straight to New York.

02:03:38.411 --> 02:03:40.329
She was a liar. She was a liar!

02:03:40.413 --> 02:03:44.083
Answer my question.
Weren't you paid to get out of town?

02:03:47.337 --> 02:03:50.839
There was no Eddie, no pilot.
You've never been married.

02:03:51.049 --> 02:03:53.926
That was not only a lie,
it was an insult to dead heroes

02:03:54.010 --> 02:03:56.053
and the women who loved them.

02:03:56.137 --> 02:04:00.349
San Francisco has no Shubert Theatre.
You've never been to San Francisco.

02:04:00.475 --> 02:04:04.103
That was a stupid lie, easy to expose,
not worthy of you.

02:04:04.187 --> 02:04:06.146
I had to get in to meet Margo.

02:04:06.231 --> 02:04:09.358
I had to say something, be somebody.
Make her like me!

02:04:09.442 --> 02:04:11.777
She did like you.
She helped and trusted you.

02:04:11.861 --> 02:04:14.780
-You repaid her by trying to win Bill.
-That's not true!

02:04:14.864 --> 02:04:19.034
I was there. I saw you and heard you
through the dressing-room door.

02:04:19.869 --> 02:04:23.539
You used my name to blackmail Karen
into getting you the part of Cora.

02:04:23.623 --> 02:04:26.708
-You lied to me about it.
-No!

02:04:26.876 --> 02:04:29.628
I had lunch with Karen
not three hours ago.

02:04:29.712 --> 02:04:34.716
As always with women who try to find out
things, she told more than she learnt.

02:04:35.510 --> 02:04:37.010
Now do you want to change your story

02:04:37.095 --> 02:04:39.805
about Lloyd beating at your door
that night?

02:04:39.889 --> 02:04:41.723
Please, please.

02:04:46.312 --> 02:04:51.483
That I should want you at all suddenly
strikes me as the height of improbability.

02:04:51.568 --> 02:04:55.237
But that in itself is probably the reason.

02:04:55.321 --> 02:05:00.159
You're an improbable person, Eve,
and so am I. We have that in common.

02:05:00.243 --> 02:05:04.580
Also a contempt for humanity,
an inability to love and be loved.

02:05:04.664 --> 02:05:08.417
Insatiable ambition and talent.

02:05:08.543 --> 02:05:12.004
We deserve each other.
Are you listening to me?

02:05:14.257 --> 02:05:17.217
-Then say so.
-Yes, Addison.

02:05:17.510 --> 02:05:21.555
And you realize and you agree
how completely you belong to me?

02:05:22.015 --> 02:05:23.599
Yes, Addison.

02:05:24.267 --> 02:05:27.603
Then take your nap,
and good luck for tonight.

02:05:32.775 --> 02:05:34.860
I won't play tonight.

02:05:34.944 --> 02:05:39.531
I couldn't. Not possibly. I couldn't go on.

02:05:39.616 --> 02:05:43.869
"Couldn't go on"?
You'll give the performance of your life.

02:05:58.009 --> 02:05:59.259
(door closes)

02:06:02.555 --> 02:06:05.557
(Addison) And she gave
the performance of her life.

02:06:05.642 --> 02:06:08.393
And it was a night to remember,
that night.

02:06:08.478 --> 02:06:11.104
(applause and cheering)

02:06:18.488 --> 02:06:21.657
Honored members of
the Sarah Siddons Society,

02:06:21.741 --> 02:06:25.160
distinguished guests,
ladies and gentlemen.

02:06:26.496 --> 02:06:28.914
What is there for me to say?

02:06:28.998 --> 02:06:32.501
Everything wise and witty
has long since been said

02:06:32.585 --> 02:06:37.005
by minds more mature
and talents far greater than mine.

02:06:37.131 --> 02:06:40.592
For me to thank you as equals
would be presumptuous.

02:06:40.677 --> 02:06:43.178
I am an apprentice in the theatre,

02:06:43.304 --> 02:06:46.431
and have much to learn from all of you.

02:06:46.516 --> 02:06:50.185
Let me say only that I am proud and happy,

02:06:51.145 --> 02:06:54.189
and that I regard this great honor

02:06:54.274 --> 02:06:57.442
not so much as an award
for what I have achieved,

02:06:57.527 --> 02:07:00.946
but as a standard to hold against
what I have yet to accomplish.

02:07:01.030 --> 02:07:02.698
(applause)

02:07:03.199 --> 02:07:08.203
And, further, that I regard it
as bestowed upon me only in part.

02:07:09.372 --> 02:07:13.875
The larger share belongs
to my friends in the theatre,

02:07:14.002 --> 02:07:16.545
and to the theatre itself

02:07:16.671 --> 02:07:19.548
which has given me all I have.

02:07:21.009 --> 02:07:25.178
In good conscience,
I must give credit where credit is due.

02:07:26.681 --> 02:07:30.309
To Max Fabian. Dear Max.

02:07:30.810 --> 02:07:34.980
Dear sentimental, generous,
courageous Max Fabian,

02:07:35.064 --> 02:07:38.900
who took a chance on
an unknown, untried amateur.

02:07:43.573 --> 02:07:47.159
To my first friend in the theatre,

02:07:47.243 --> 02:07:51.163
whose kindness and graciousness
I shall never forget,

02:07:51.247 --> 02:07:53.749
Karen. Mrs. Lloyd Richards.

02:07:59.922 --> 02:08:03.925
It was Karen who first brought me
to one whom I'd always idolized,

02:08:04.010 --> 02:08:07.346
one who became
my benefactress and champion.

02:08:08.556 --> 02:08:12.392
A great actress and a great woman,

02:08:12.769 --> 02:08:14.311
Margo Channing.

02:08:14.395 --> 02:08:15.729
(cheering)

02:08:19.776 --> 02:08:22.194
To my director,

02:08:22.278 --> 02:08:27.199
who demanded always a little more
than my talent could provide,

02:08:27.283 --> 02:08:30.035
but who taught me patiently and well,

02:08:31.621 --> 02:08:33.080
Bill Sampson.

02:08:33.164 --> 02:08:34.498
(applause)

02:08:36.542 --> 02:08:40.629
And one without whose
great play and faith in me,

02:08:41.297 --> 02:08:44.132
this night could never have been.

02:08:44.217 --> 02:08:46.510
How can I repay Lloyd Richards?

02:08:46.594 --> 02:08:47.928
(applause)

02:08:49.472 --> 02:08:51.807
How can I repay the many others,

02:08:51.933 --> 02:08:54.976
so many,
I couldn't possibly name them all,

02:08:55.103 --> 02:08:58.146
whose help, guidance, and advice

02:08:59.732 --> 02:09:04.820
have made this, the happiest
night of my life, possible.

02:09:09.242 --> 02:09:13.245
Although I am going to Hollywood
next week to make a film,

02:09:13.329 --> 02:09:16.665
do not think for a moment
that I am leaving you.

02:09:16.749 --> 02:09:18.917
How could I?

02:09:19.001 --> 02:09:21.837
My heart is here in the theatre,

02:09:21.963 --> 02:09:26.425
and 3,000 miles are too far
to be away from one's heart.

02:09:26.509 --> 02:09:29.511
I'll be back to claim it, and soon.

02:09:31.264 --> 02:09:35.183
That is, if you want me back.

02:09:41.691 --> 02:09:44.943
Good night to you all,
and to all, a good night.

02:09:52.535 --> 02:09:57.038
For services rendered beyond
whatever it is of duty, darling.

02:10:01.836 --> 02:10:07.132
Come on, I'm the host. I got to get home
before my guests start stealing the liquor.

02:10:09.886 --> 02:10:12.721
-Congratulations, Eve.
-Thank you, Karen.

02:10:16.017 --> 02:10:19.978
-Congratulations, Miss Harrington.
-Oh, thank you so much.

02:10:20.897 --> 02:10:25.650
Nice speech, Eve. But I wouldn't worry
too much about your heart.

02:10:25.735 --> 02:10:29.529
You can always put that award
where your heart ought to be.

02:10:32.033 --> 02:10:34.075
I don't suppose there's a drink left?

02:10:34.202 --> 02:10:36.995
-You can have one at Max's.
-I don't think I'm going.

02:10:37.079 --> 02:10:41.082
-Why not?
-Because I don't want to.

02:10:41.209 --> 02:10:44.753
-I'm so happy for you, Eve.
-Thank you so much.

02:10:46.255 --> 02:10:47.839
Max has gone to a lot of trouble.

02:10:47.924 --> 02:10:51.343
This is going to be an elaborate party
and it's for you.

02:10:51.427 --> 02:10:54.930
No, it isn't. It's for this.

02:10:55.056 --> 02:10:57.766
-It's the same thing, isn't it?
-Exactly.

02:10:59.060 --> 02:11:01.937
Here, take it to the party instead of me.

02:11:02.021 --> 02:11:04.272
You're being very childish.

02:11:04.357 --> 02:11:08.527
-I'm tired. I want to go home.
-Very well. I'll drop you off.

02:11:08.611 --> 02:11:12.280
I shall go to the party alone.
I have no intention of missing it.

02:12:38.826 --> 02:12:40.952
-Who are you?
-Miss Harrington.

02:12:41.037 --> 02:12:44.831
-What are you doing here?
-I... I guess I fell asleep.

02:12:47.960 --> 02:12:52.047
Please don't have me arrested.
I didn't steal anything. You can search me.

02:12:52.131 --> 02:12:56.051
-How did you get in here?
-I hid outside till the maid came in.

02:12:56.177 --> 02:12:58.970
She went out to get something
and left the door open.

02:12:59.055 --> 02:13:03.141
I sneaked in and hid till she'd finished.
Then I just looked around.

02:13:03.225 --> 02:13:06.978
I was afraid someone would notice
the lights were on, so I turned them off.

02:13:07.063 --> 02:13:10.649
-Then I guess I fell asleep.
-You were just looking around?

02:13:10.733 --> 02:13:12.651
-That's all.
-What for?

02:13:12.735 --> 02:13:15.403
-You probably won't believe me.
-Probably not.

02:13:15.529 --> 02:13:17.989
-It was for my report.
-What report? To whom?

02:13:18.074 --> 02:13:20.909
About how you live,
what kind of clothes you wear,

02:13:21.035 --> 02:13:25.163
what kind of perfume
and books, things like that.

02:13:25.247 --> 02:13:29.250
You know the Eve Harrington Club that
they have in most girls' high schools?

02:13:29.377 --> 02:13:33.338
-I've heard of them.
-Ours was one of the first, Erasmus Hall.

02:13:33.422 --> 02:13:37.759
-I'm the president.
-Erasmus Hall. That's in Brooklyn, isn't it?

02:13:37.843 --> 02:13:42.263
Lots of actresses come from Brooklyn.
Barbara Stanwyck and Susan Hayward.

02:13:42.348 --> 02:13:44.766
Of course, they're just movie stars.

02:13:44.850 --> 02:13:47.519
You're going to Hollywood, aren't you?

02:13:47.603 --> 02:13:48.770
Mm-hm.

02:13:48.938 --> 02:13:52.607
From the trunks you're packing,
you must be going to stay a long time.

02:13:52.692 --> 02:13:54.776
I might.

02:13:58.781 --> 02:14:01.700
That spilled drink's gonna ruin your carpet.

02:14:01.784 --> 02:14:04.285
Maid'll fix it in the morning.

02:14:05.204 --> 02:14:08.123
-I'll just clean up the mess.
-Don't bother.

02:14:08.958 --> 02:14:12.043
-How'd you get up here from Brooklyn?
-Subway.

02:14:13.129 --> 02:14:15.380
How long does it take?

02:14:15.464 --> 02:14:18.383
With changing and everything,
a little over an hour.

02:14:18.467 --> 02:14:22.137
It's after one now.
You won't get home till all hours.

02:14:23.973 --> 02:14:26.057
I don't care if I never get home.

02:14:26.142 --> 02:14:27.392
(buzzer)

02:14:28.436 --> 02:14:30.478
That's the door.

02:14:33.607 --> 02:14:35.650
You rest. I'll get it.

02:14:43.826 --> 02:14:46.161
Hello. Who are you?

02:14:46.996 --> 02:14:50.999
Miss Harrington's resting, Mr. DeWitt.
She asked me to see who it is.

02:14:51.125 --> 02:14:53.168
Well, we won't disturb her rest.

02:14:53.294 --> 02:14:58.423
It seems Miss Harrington left her award
in the taxi cab. Will you give it to her?

02:14:59.675 --> 02:15:02.677
Tell me, how did you know my name?

02:15:03.471 --> 02:15:06.181
It's a very famous name, Mr. DeWitt.

02:15:06.265 --> 02:15:08.683
-And what's your name?
-Phoebe.

02:15:09.351 --> 02:15:12.353
-Phoebe?
-I call myself Phoebe.

02:15:13.689 --> 02:15:15.607
And why not?

02:15:15.691 --> 02:15:21.029
Tell me, Phoebe, do you want someday
to have an award like that of your own?

02:15:21.113 --> 02:15:26.534
-More than anything else in the world.
-Then ask Miss Harrington how to get one.

02:15:27.703 --> 02:15:30.622
Miss Harrington knows all about it.

02:15:39.173 --> 02:15:41.299
(Eve) Who was it?

02:15:41.383 --> 02:15:43.551
Just a taxi driver, Miss Harrington.

02:15:43.677 --> 02:15:47.555
You left your award in his cab,
and he brought it back.

02:15:47.640 --> 02:15:51.643
(Eve) Put it on one of the trunks,
will you? I wanna pack it.

02:15:51.727 --> 02:15:53.853
Sure, Miss Harrington.
