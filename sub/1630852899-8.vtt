00:09.052 --> 00:10.662
Previously onFrom...

00:10.793 --> 00:12.360
You can't keep
punishing yourself, Boyd.

00:12.490 --> 00:13.622
She wouldn't have wanted that.

00:13.752 --> 00:16.320
And I wish you had
the luxury of grief,

00:16.451 --> 00:19.062
but you don't.
These people need you.

00:19.193 --> 00:21.369
I knew all about the divorce
and how this whole trip

00:21.499 --> 00:23.023
was just one last hurrah

00:23.153 --> 00:24.763
before you sat us down
to break the news.

00:24.894 --> 00:27.897
Thomas is dead!
You have two other kids!

00:28.028 --> 00:29.725
Why aren't we enough for you?

00:33.772 --> 00:36.645
Hello?
Is anybody out there?

00:42.694 --> 00:45.045
Seriously, man, I don't know why
you keep staring at that thing.

00:45.175 --> 00:47.525
Yeah, there's two pages
stuck together here.

00:49.527 --> 00:50.441
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:55.533 --> 00:57.492
Holy shit.

00:57.622 --> 00:59.276
I have Sara tied up
in the basement of the church.

00:59.407 --> 01:01.278
She showed me this.

01:01.409 --> 01:03.454
Something was
watching me that day,

01:03.585 --> 01:05.065
the same thing that told Sara--

01:05.195 --> 01:07.502
And you think this thing
is trying to help us?

01:07.632 --> 01:09.460
Whatever it is, it's a part
of the fabric of this place.

01:09.591 --> 01:11.810
They're in the house!
They're inside!

01:17.425 --> 01:19.296
Follow protocol!

01:19.427 --> 01:21.385
Find your buddy,
get into the van!

01:21.516 --> 01:22.560
Ellis! We have to
get back in the house!

01:22.691 --> 01:25.085
We have to get inside!
I have an idea. Come on!

01:28.653 --> 01:30.220
Please, please, please, please!

01:30.351 --> 01:31.308
We have to go.

01:31.439 --> 01:33.441
Go where?
Where are we going?

01:33.571 --> 01:35.225
You go first.

01:35.356 --> 01:36.966
I'll follow you down.

01:37.097 --> 01:39.316
We need to get to town.

01:39.447 --> 01:40.665
No. We have to go to the trees.

01:40.796 --> 01:41.971
You're crazy.

01:42.102 --> 01:44.278
You have to get inside.

01:44.408 --> 01:45.714
-The tree? No! No!
-You'll be safe!

01:45.844 --> 01:47.324
-What?
-I promise.

01:47.455 --> 01:48.978
Find your brother.
You have to tell him.

01:49.109 --> 01:50.936
I'll be right behind you!

01:55.637 --> 01:57.900
No!
No, come here!

02:00.598 --> 02:02.252
Stay with me.

02:24.448 --> 02:25.449
Hey, Sheriff?

02:25.580 --> 02:27.147
Yep.

02:28.365 --> 02:30.237
In a sec.

02:37.418 --> 02:38.941
I got, uh--

02:39.071 --> 02:40.682
I got most of the Colony House
residents squared away.

02:40.812 --> 02:43.119
Most people in town aren't
really using their basements,

02:43.250 --> 02:45.556
so each house is
gonna take two or three.

02:45.687 --> 02:47.167
Some are at the clinic and, uh,

02:47.297 --> 02:49.517
the last three are gonna
stay with me and my mom...

02:49.647 --> 02:52.433
and Jade, I guess.

02:52.563 --> 02:54.652
Okay.

02:54.783 --> 02:57.655
Feels like things are starting
to get tense out there.

02:57.786 --> 03:00.223
People are already
boarding up their windows,

03:00.354 --> 03:02.573
and with Colony House and
the town living together now,

03:02.704 --> 03:05.489
I think maybe we should get
everyone gathered together

03:05.620 --> 03:07.709
and, I don't know,
say something?

03:07.839 --> 03:09.537
It's a good idea.

03:09.667 --> 03:12.670
You should do that.

03:13.323 --> 03:16.326
I think it would mean
a lot more coming from you.

03:17.588 --> 03:18.894
Right.

03:19.634 --> 03:21.288
Right.

03:22.506 --> 03:24.682
Are you okay?

03:26.510 --> 03:28.643
He saved my life.
You know that?

03:28.773 --> 03:31.689
Father Khatri,
the night we got into town,

03:31.820 --> 03:34.214
he risked his own life
to make sure that...

03:36.738 --> 03:38.870
-Give everyone my regards.
-Wait. Where are you going?

03:39.001 --> 03:40.089
I got something to do.
It's important.

03:40.220 --> 03:42.047
More important than this?

03:42.700 --> 03:45.399
Sheriff, the people
need you right now.

03:45.529 --> 03:47.096
-They need to hear that--
-What?

03:47.227 --> 03:49.272
They need to hear what?

03:49.403 --> 03:51.231
Everything's gonna be okay?
That God's got a plan.

03:51.361 --> 03:53.581
Look, if you're gonna be
the sheriff when I'm gone,

03:53.711 --> 03:55.713
you're gonna need to start
figuring out how to say things

03:55.844 --> 03:58.803
like that for yourself
and sound halfway convincing.

03:58.934 --> 04:01.719
You'll do fine.

04:05.810 --> 04:16.038
♪

04:23.915 --> 04:26.266
Let's take a walk.

04:36.493 --> 04:41.542
♪

06:42.402 --> 06:43.794
♪ And if I had a boat

06:43.925 --> 06:46.101
-Come on!
-♪ I'd go out on the ocean

06:46.231 --> 06:48.364
-Listen to those lyrics.
-♪ And if I had a pony

06:48.495 --> 06:50.671
Listen to how
peaceful that sounds.

06:50.801 --> 06:54.631
The man is riding
a pony on an ocean.

06:54.762 --> 06:58.461
You know why?
'Cause he has a boat.

06:58.592 --> 07:00.855
Doesn't matter how many times
you listen to the song,

07:00.985 --> 07:02.813
still can't afford
to buy a boat.

07:02.944 --> 07:05.381
Yeah, look, all I'm saying is
if we manage the payments--

07:05.512 --> 07:07.209
Oh, we're gonna
manage the payments?

07:07.339 --> 07:09.820
-Yeah!
-Right.

07:09.951 --> 07:11.735
So, is not paying the payments
one of the management options?

07:11.866 --> 07:14.782
Because that's
the option we'd be taking.

07:14.912 --> 07:16.740
Yeah, I'm pretty sure most
lenders frown on that option.

07:16.871 --> 07:18.873
Yeah, yeah. Listen,
nobody's talking to you.

07:19.003 --> 07:21.789
-All right? Nobody.

07:21.919 --> 07:23.834
You know what they used
to call e in the army, right?

07:23.965 --> 07:25.357
Mr. Fish and Loaves.

07:25.488 --> 07:27.185
That's right!
That's right! That's right!

07:27.316 --> 07:28.796
They'd send me to
any base to set it up,

07:28.926 --> 07:31.451
and no matter what they gave me,
no matter what the resources,

07:31.581 --> 07:33.278
I would make it work.
Yes, sir, that's right.

07:33.409 --> 07:34.584
Mr. Fish and Loaves.

07:34.715 --> 07:35.933
...Loaves.

07:36.064 --> 07:38.370
Yeah, but, you know, didn't
they call mom Iron Abby?

07:38.501 --> 07:40.329
They certainly did.
And don't you forget it.

07:40.460 --> 07:43.114
Yeah, yeah.
I hear you.

07:43.245 --> 07:45.987
The problem with iron is...
rigid.

07:46.117 --> 07:49.512
So, sometimes, you know,
it doesn't know when to bend.

07:49.643 --> 07:50.557
Uh-huh.

07:50.687 --> 07:53.864
Babe... Babe...
all I'm saying,

07:53.995 --> 07:55.953
all I'm saying is, a boat,

07:56.084 --> 07:59.348
you know, wouldn't be
a bad retirement gift.

07:59.479 --> 08:01.481
In case you
needed some ideas

08:01.611 --> 08:05.049
on how to help me, you know,
smooth my transition

08:05.180 --> 08:09.445
from a long and decorated
military career to, you know,

08:09.576 --> 08:11.882
this strange and mysterious
civilian life.

08:12.013 --> 08:14.798
And a boat-- Babe, what are--
what are you looking for?

08:14.929 --> 08:16.887
My-my Chapstick. I can't
find anything in this bag.

08:17.018 --> 08:19.368
Can you hold this for me?

08:19.499 --> 08:21.805
Sure.
What is-- Is--

08:21.936 --> 08:24.808
This--
This looks like a boat key.

08:24.939 --> 08:26.767
-What?
-What?

08:26.897 --> 08:29.509
Yeah, why am I holding
a-a boat key?

08:29.639 --> 08:31.685
-Wait, did you buy the boat?

08:31.815 --> 08:33.469
-Oh, shit.

08:33.600 --> 08:35.819
Of course we
bought you a boat!

08:35.950 --> 08:37.865
-Oh, snap!
-If I had to listen to that man

08:37.995 --> 08:39.867
sing about Tonto and
his pony one more time,

08:39.997 --> 08:41.738
I'd throw myself into traffic.

08:41.869 --> 08:43.392
-Oh, snap!
-Happy retirement, Dad!

08:43.523 --> 08:45.307
You bought me a boat, baby!

08:45.437 --> 08:46.613
-Thank you!
-Dad!

08:46.743 --> 08:48.615
Oh!

08:57.798 --> 08:58.886
Oh, God.

09:05.022 --> 09:07.503
Please,

09:07.634 --> 09:09.897
can you just tell me
where we're going?

09:10.027 --> 09:11.681
Where's Father Khatri?

09:13.901 --> 09:16.599
They used to shriek.
Did you know that?

09:16.730 --> 09:21.038
All night long, they'd shriek.
Drove people crazy.

09:21.691 --> 09:24.433
That all stopped
once we got the talismans.

09:24.564 --> 09:25.739
Then they started to whisper.

09:25.869 --> 09:28.045
I always wondered about that.

09:28.176 --> 09:30.570
Your voices tell you
anything about that?

09:31.832 --> 09:33.355
No.

09:33.485 --> 09:36.271
'Course not. God forbid
they tell you anything useful.

09:37.272 --> 09:39.491
Keep walking.

09:39.622 --> 09:42.277
Not until you
tell me what's going on.

09:42.407 --> 09:43.844
You think you're
gonna stand there

09:43.974 --> 09:45.454
and make demands
after what you did?

09:45.585 --> 09:46.716
Where is Father Khatri?

09:46.847 --> 09:48.762
He's dead!

09:48.892 --> 09:50.285
What?

09:50.415 --> 09:51.895
Those things got
into Colony House.

09:52.026 --> 09:55.464
Father Khatri tried to help.
Now he's dead,

09:55.595 --> 09:57.945
along with a lot
of other people.

09:58.075 --> 10:00.077
Is Ellis okay?

10:02.906 --> 10:05.866
He's fine.
He's scraped up.

10:05.996 --> 10:08.782
He's back at the clinic
with the others.

10:10.131 --> 10:11.872
Oh, now you wanna cry.

10:12.002 --> 10:14.788
You cry like that
for Bing Qian?

10:14.918 --> 10:17.007
You think I'm a monster.

10:17.138 --> 10:19.140
I don't give
two shits what you are.

10:19.270 --> 10:21.838
The only reason you're alive
is because Father Khatri

10:21.969 --> 10:23.492
thought you could
help us all get home.

10:23.623 --> 10:25.059
The second you prove him wrong,

10:25.189 --> 10:28.018
I'm gonna put
a bullet in you myself.

10:28.149 --> 10:30.107
Now, keep walking.

10:32.022 --> 10:33.720
-Where are we going?
-I said keep walking!

10:44.252 --> 10:46.210
So, I'll make up some beds
for you in the basement.

10:46.341 --> 10:48.952
Uh, bathroom's in the back and
feel free to use the kitchen,

10:49.083 --> 10:50.998
but you've gotta
respect the rations.

10:51.128 --> 10:52.956
It won't be the most
comfortable thing in the world,

10:53.087 --> 10:54.523
but we should have Colony House
back up

10:54.654 --> 10:56.003
and running pretty soon, so...

10:56.133 --> 10:58.222
What the fuck is this?

10:58.353 --> 11:00.921
Uh, we're gonna have a few more
house guests for a little while.

11:01.051 --> 11:05.099
And how little
is a little while?

11:05.229 --> 11:07.536
Aren't you the guy that thought
this was a giant escape room?

11:07.667 --> 11:09.451
How'd that work out for you?

11:09.581 --> 11:10.844
-Fuck off.
-Okay.

11:10.974 --> 11:12.672
All right,
this is bullshit, okay?

11:12.802 --> 11:14.369
They chose the flower.
They don't belong here.

11:14.499 --> 11:15.631
Dude, why don't
you just--

11:15.762 --> 11:16.850
All right,
any of you guys know Victor?

11:16.980 --> 11:19.940
All right, where's he squatting?
I need to find him.

11:20.070 --> 11:21.898
I saw him running
towards the woods

11:22.029 --> 11:23.595
with the Matthews
girl last night.

11:23.726 --> 11:25.946
Fantastic.
See what a little intercommunity

11:26.076 --> 11:28.731
cooperation can do?
Kumbay-fucking-ya!

11:30.341 --> 11:31.908
Let's get inside.

11:32.039 --> 11:34.128
That guy's
the fuckin' worst.

11:34.258 --> 11:37.261
I don't--
I don't even understand.

11:37.392 --> 11:39.916
It was like one second everyone
was having such a good time--

11:40.047 --> 11:41.962
How-- How did you
get out of the house?

11:42.876 --> 11:45.530
I was-- I was up in
Victor's room and we--

11:45.661 --> 11:47.750
No. It...

11:47.881 --> 11:49.926
-It wasn't like that. We were...
-Julie...

11:50.057 --> 11:52.015
No, he was stacking
all of these,

11:52.146 --> 11:53.974
and it looked like he was
getting ready to leave.

11:54.104 --> 11:56.106
And then,
when the screaming started,

11:56.237 --> 11:58.674
we climbed out his window,

11:58.805 --> 12:00.545
and he said we had
to go to the forest.

12:00.676 --> 12:03.244
And then, we ran to this tree
and then he pushed me inside--

12:03.374 --> 12:05.072
-Hey.
-And I...

12:05.202 --> 12:06.900
He said it was starting.

12:07.030 --> 12:08.510
What was starting?

12:08.640 --> 12:10.730
I don't know. He...

12:13.820 --> 12:16.083
All I know is, one second,
I was in a tree,

12:16.213 --> 12:18.955
and the next, I was in a
giant cabinet in a root cellar.

12:19.086 --> 12:20.130
How is that possible?

12:20.261 --> 12:22.872
You went through a Farway Tree!

12:23.003 --> 12:25.005
Huh?

12:25.135 --> 12:28.225
Victor said you can
go all sorts of places.

12:28.356 --> 12:32.012
And sometimes people
go to different places.

12:32.142 --> 12:34.101
So, maybe he went
somewhere else.

12:34.231 --> 12:36.059
We have to find him!

12:36.190 --> 12:38.932
One step at a time.
Hey, Julie...

12:41.238 --> 12:42.892
Jules...
Hey, Jules.

12:45.025 --> 12:46.461
Julie...

12:48.115 --> 12:50.987
What's happening to us?
What--?

12:51.118 --> 12:52.946
-Honey...
-What is going on?

12:53.076 --> 12:54.034
What's happening?

12:54.164 --> 12:56.123
We're digging a big hole
in the basement.

12:56.253 --> 12:58.603
We're gonna find out where
the electricity comes from.

12:58.734 --> 13:00.867
Hey, hey. No.

13:02.172 --> 13:03.870
Jules, we're gonna be fine.
Breathe.

13:05.132 --> 13:06.655
I know.
Everything's gonna be okay.

13:06.786 --> 13:08.396
-Yes.
-No! How can you say that?

13:08.526 --> 13:10.659
What part of this is okay?

13:10.790 --> 13:13.053
Honey, oh my God.
Just...

13:13.183 --> 13:16.056
Ah. Good, you're here.
Have you seen Victor?

13:16.186 --> 13:17.797
-Hey!
-One of the squatters

13:17.927 --> 13:19.929
at my house said you ran off to
the woods with him last night!

13:20.060 --> 13:20.974
Ow! Ow!

13:21.104 --> 13:22.149
Hey!
I need to talk to her!

13:22.279 --> 13:25.108
What is wrong with you?!

13:25.239 --> 13:27.154
Do you have any idea
what she has been through?

13:27.284 --> 13:29.112
Look, believe me, I get it.
Times are tough all around.

13:29.243 --> 13:31.506
But I found
something last night!

13:32.986 --> 13:35.989
There is this symbol that
I've been-- I've been seeing.

13:36.119 --> 13:37.686
The same symbol is in this book.

13:37.817 --> 13:39.166
And last night, okay,
last night,

13:39.296 --> 13:40.820
I found this photo!

13:40.950 --> 13:42.256
I don't give a shit
about your questions

13:42.386 --> 13:44.258
and your symbol and your books.

13:44.388 --> 13:46.651
Just stay the fuck away
from my daughter.

13:46.782 --> 13:48.915
You understand me?

13:51.004 --> 13:55.182
Okay, you're doing the whole
protective dad thing.

13:55.312 --> 13:57.053
I respect that.

13:57.184 --> 14:00.143
You dragged me out
into the woods,

14:00.274 --> 14:03.146
have me climb a fuckin' tree
for some stupid idea,

14:03.277 --> 14:05.148
and then you
run off like a psycho

14:05.279 --> 14:07.063
before we even have
a chance to try it.

14:07.194 --> 14:10.588
Yeah, uh,
I'm sorry about that...

14:10.719 --> 14:12.025
It worked.

14:14.331 --> 14:16.246
-Wait. What?
-Yeah.

14:16.377 --> 14:19.989
All I got was some static,
but it worked.

14:23.253 --> 14:25.038
I think if we get it
up over the tree line,

14:25.168 --> 14:26.300
and we get it enough power,

14:26.430 --> 14:28.084
I think we could
get a signal out.

14:28.215 --> 14:29.346
Wait, wait, wait.

14:29.477 --> 14:31.871
How do you propose we
get up over the tree line?

14:33.263 --> 14:35.918
We start by going
to the high ground.

Okay?
There isn't much time.

15:16.785 --> 15:20.354
Now, this is gonna
sound very, very strange,

15:20.484 --> 15:22.138
and you're not
gonna believe me,

15:22.269 --> 15:24.184
and I wouldn't
believe me either. Okay?

more time to explain.

are you doing?

Okay, you have a gun.
That is good.

pointed at me the entire time.

15:40.069 --> 15:43.855
But I am begging you,
please come with me.

15:43.986 --> 15:46.815
Go on.
Drive away. Drive away.

15:46.946 --> 15:48.425
No, no, no, no. Please.

15:51.385 --> 15:54.301
What the hell was that?

15:54.431 --> 15:56.346
That was death,

15:56.477 --> 15:58.958

Please.

gonna hurt you are out there,

16:32.165 --> 16:34.297

make a damn bit of difference

16:34.428 --> 16:35.690

16:35.820 --> 16:41.652
Look, I know you
all have questions.

16:42.479 --> 16:46.483

-Okay.

-All right.
-Yeah.

17:20.430 --> 17:21.910
Just gonna put a sling on here.

Can I help with anything?

17:23.303 --> 17:25.870
Make sure
he doesn't get out of bed. Okay?

17:26.001 --> 17:27.307
I don't want you going anywhere

17:27.437 --> 17:30.005
until I can give you
a solid once-over.

17:30.136 --> 17:31.354
-Yeah.
-All right?

17:32.790 --> 17:34.227
Here we go. You good?

17:36.011 --> 17:37.230
Be back in
a second, okay?

17:37.360 --> 17:39.232
Thank you.

17:39.362 --> 17:41.625
Hey.

17:41.756 --> 17:43.453
Busy day for you.

17:43.584 --> 17:45.238
Uh, yeah, we're
a little short-handed.

17:45.368 --> 17:46.848
What can I do?

17:46.978 --> 17:48.284
Well, I could use some help

17:48.415 --> 17:49.851
getting this place
a bit more secure.

17:49.981 --> 17:51.940
It's gonna be a full house
tonight, given what happened.

17:52.071 --> 17:53.637
-So...
-Yeah, of course.

17:53.768 --> 17:55.987
Oh, I, um...

17:56.118 --> 17:59.382
I, uh...
I finished Chapter 6. It's...

17:59.513 --> 18:01.341
Things are starting
to get interesting.

18:01.471 --> 18:02.342
Yeah, I don't think
it's gonna be

18:02.472 --> 18:04.300
much of a reading
night tonight, but, uh,

18:04.431 --> 18:05.910
yeah, I'll try to check it out.

18:06.041 --> 18:07.216
Cool.

18:10.741 --> 18:12.569
Thanks, Deputy.

18:26.322 --> 18:27.584
Donna.

18:37.594 --> 18:40.423
You got a minute?

18:40.554 --> 18:42.686
How's Julie?

18:42.817 --> 18:45.254
She's okay.

18:45.385 --> 18:46.821
She's, uh...

18:46.951 --> 18:49.345
But that--
that's not why I'm here.

18:49.476 --> 18:51.434
We came because
we need your help.

18:51.565 --> 18:52.479
With what?

18:54.481 --> 18:56.613
We wanna build a tower

18:56.744 --> 18:58.267
and we wanna
put it on the roof.

18:58.398 --> 18:59.355
What?

18:59.486 --> 19:00.791
We think if we can
get it high enough,

19:00.922 --> 19:04.099
we could
broadcast a signal

19:04.230 --> 19:06.362
that anyone else
in the area could hear.

19:06.493 --> 19:09.017
And what area
is that exactly?

19:09.148 --> 19:12.542
Look, whatever
this place is,

19:12.673 --> 19:16.459
wherever this place is,

19:16.590 --> 19:19.506
radio signals work
in ways that we can't.

19:19.636 --> 19:22.335
And we already got a strong
indication that this could work.

19:24.293 --> 19:26.513
Well...
We got a little static.

19:26.643 --> 19:29.472
C--Colony House

19:29.603 --> 19:32.475
is the highest point
on the highest hill.

19:32.606 --> 19:34.695
And if we build a tower
and we put it up there,

19:34.825 --> 19:37.132
we could broadcast out a signal
that could get up over

19:37.263 --> 19:40.875
any interference
from the forest canopy.

19:43.399 --> 19:45.662
Sure.

19:48.143 --> 19:50.189
You're okay with this?

19:50.319 --> 19:53.322
You know how many people
died here last night?

19:54.628 --> 19:56.195
Fourteen.

19:58.588 --> 20:00.634
Those things killed
14 of my people.

20:00.764 --> 20:04.768
There are pieces of them
lying all over this hill.

20:04.899 --> 20:08.337
And I don't think the others
are coming back any time soon.

20:11.645 --> 20:13.951
So, we might as well use
the house for something.

20:17.564 --> 20:19.218
Keep going.

20:23.178 --> 20:24.397
Wait right there.

20:33.493 --> 20:34.929
Let's go.

20:43.546 --> 20:45.113
You're gonna sit tight here.

20:45.244 --> 20:47.811
I'll be back before dark.

20:47.942 --> 20:52.425
I've got a few things in town
to wrap up before we head out.

20:52.555 --> 20:53.774
Head out where?

20:53.904 --> 20:56.472
Find our way home.

20:56.603 --> 20:59.475
You won't need those.

20:59.606 --> 21:02.609
I'm not going anywhere.

21:02.739 --> 21:05.351
I wanna help.

21:06.526 --> 21:09.529
All I've ever
wanted to do is help.

21:09.659 --> 21:11.574

chain you to here anyway.

easier said than done.

23:41.158 --> 23:42.290

looking out for each other,
taking care of each other,

23:57.174 --> 24:00.482

But where do we start?

24:10.884 --> 24:13.364
All right.

24:13.495 --> 24:15.889

everything inventoried,

drawing up a system

25:41.278 --> 25:43.237
It's not
that simple, honey.

25:48.982 --> 25:51.027
Hey. Hey.

-Is it me?
-No.

26:05.259 --> 26:06.739

26:06.869 --> 26:08.915
Oh, God, no.
No, no, no. No.

26:09.045 --> 26:11.787
No, honey, you didn't
do anything wrong. Don't...

26:11.918 --> 26:13.354
No.

26:17.880 --> 26:19.273
Listen.

26:21.101 --> 26:24.800
There are things that
you'll only understand

26:24.931 --> 26:27.411
when you become a parent.

26:27.542 --> 26:31.024
One of those things...

26:31.154 --> 26:33.287
is that you live
for your children.

26:37.030 --> 26:41.687
Your only job is-- is
to love them and protect them.

26:47.083 --> 26:49.695
So when Thomas died...

26:51.958 --> 26:53.786
something inside of me broke.

26:59.008 --> 27:01.097
And I have
no idea how to fix it.

27:07.974 --> 27:10.106
I keep reliving that day.

27:13.022 --> 27:14.763
It was just
such a normal day.

27:16.722 --> 27:19.812
You and Ethan were
in the next room.

27:19.942 --> 27:21.378
Your Dad and I
were in the kitchen,

27:21.509 --> 27:24.643
and Thomas was in his changing
table right between us.

27:37.133 --> 27:38.787
Then the phone rang.

27:41.137 --> 27:42.661
I reached for the diaper

27:42.791 --> 27:44.837
and your father reached
for the phone and...

27:47.187 --> 27:52.018
we just turned for one second...

27:52.148 --> 27:54.542
just one fucking second...

27:54.673 --> 27:57.676
and he rolled off the table.

28:06.032 --> 28:09.165
Your father
is the love of my life.

28:13.213 --> 28:15.432
But sometimes I see him and...

28:18.435 --> 28:22.048
I hear
that fucking phone ring.

28:22.178 --> 28:25.834
Why didn't you tell me that?

28:29.490 --> 28:32.972
Because no matter
how grown up you are,

28:33.102 --> 28:35.714
you're always
gonna be my little girl.

28:39.674 --> 28:41.763
So we pretended...

28:45.071 --> 28:46.855
yeah, that everything was fine.

28:49.510 --> 28:51.730
I think that just made
everything worse.

28:55.995 --> 28:57.736
I'm sorry.

28:59.215 --> 29:02.044
I'm sorry, too.

29:10.357 --> 29:11.967
Let us in!

29:15.231 --> 29:19.061
There's gonna be trouble if you
don't move outta the way!

29:19.192 --> 29:20.628
-Let us in!
-Hey, hey, hey, hey!

29:20.759 --> 29:22.108
What the hell's going on?!

29:23.805 --> 29:24.937
Tom, Eli,
what the hell are you doing?

29:25.067 --> 29:27.156
We got people from Colony House
in our houses,

29:27.287 --> 29:28.897
using our supplies!

29:29.028 --> 29:30.377
If I gotta choose between me

29:30.507 --> 29:32.335
and some asshole from
Colony House raiding this place,

29:32.466 --> 29:35.034
-then it's gonna be me!
-Nobody's raiding anything!

29:35.164 --> 29:36.644
Well, those things weren't
supposed to be able

29:36.775 --> 29:39.429
to get into Colony House either,
and look how that turned out!

29:39.560 --> 29:41.083
-Exactly.
-Alright. So then, you guys--

29:41.214 --> 29:43.042
you just wanna
throw it all away?

29:43.172 --> 29:45.044
Start acting like animals
and make it all worse?

29:45.174 --> 29:47.133
Look, we're gonna
figure this out.

29:47.263 --> 29:50.614
Just-- just go home.

29:50.745 --> 29:53.487
Just go home, please.

30:02.278 --> 30:04.933
They... scared.

30:05.064 --> 30:06.500
Yeah.

30:17.728 --> 30:20.427
Those things come out at night.

30:20.557 --> 30:24.561
They walking around in
the forest during the daytime?

30:24.692 --> 30:27.608
Not as far as we can tell.

30:27.738 --> 30:30.393
There might be
resources out there.

30:30.524 --> 30:32.743
We go scavenging
during the daytime,

30:32.874 --> 30:35.616
never know what
we might find.

30:35.746 --> 30:38.575
Yeah.
Good luck findin' volunteers.

30:38.706 --> 30:42.710
Right.
We'll work on that part.

30:42.841 --> 30:44.494
How long were you
in the military?

30:45.800 --> 30:47.976
Uh, almost 30 years.

30:48.107 --> 30:49.848
Hm.

30:49.978 --> 30:51.675
Set up operations
in some of the biggest,

30:51.806 --> 30:54.678
baddest clusterfucks
on the planet.

30:54.809 --> 30:57.333
And your wife?

30:57.464 --> 30:59.596
Abby was a Marine.

30:59.727 --> 31:02.556
She's the badass
in the family.

31:02.686 --> 31:03.862
Yeah.

31:16.178 --> 31:19.225
Mom, you okay?

31:19.355 --> 31:21.575
Yeah.

31:21.705 --> 31:23.838
Yeah, I'm fine. I...

31:23.969 --> 31:27.102
I was just thinking
about this dream I had

31:27.233 --> 31:28.930
when I was a little girl.

31:29.061 --> 31:30.889
I was...

31:34.022 --> 31:36.329
Never mind.
We should go help your dad.

31:36.459 --> 31:38.200
Lots to do.

31:45.207 --> 31:47.079
Can't go, not now.

31:47.209 --> 31:49.168
Damn near had
a riot at the diner.

31:49.298 --> 31:51.213
But this is exactly
why you said you had to go.

31:51.344 --> 31:53.737
Things are coming apart.
It's already starting to happen.

31:53.868 --> 31:55.739
We lost over a dozen people
last night.

31:55.870 --> 31:58.699
And we'll lose more if...
if they start to panic.

31:58.829 --> 32:00.483
-At least if you--
-Kenny, enough.

32:00.614 --> 32:02.398
I'll stay until
things settle down.

32:02.529 --> 32:04.618
And what if they don't?

32:04.748 --> 32:06.576
What if they don't?

32:06.707 --> 32:07.751
Am I interrupting?

32:07.882 --> 32:09.014
No, come on in.

32:09.144 --> 32:10.102
Sheriff, please--

32:10.232 --> 32:13.583
Kenny, we're done. Okay?

32:13.714 --> 32:16.499
We're not done.

32:18.762 --> 32:20.939
I said, we're not done.

32:22.288 --> 32:24.116
You told me you had to go.

32:24.246 --> 32:26.118
You told me
that I had to step up

32:26.248 --> 32:28.903
and be strong
while you were gone.

32:29.034 --> 32:30.731
You told me we were
running out of time,

32:30.861 --> 32:33.299
and what part
of that's changed? Huh?

32:33.429 --> 32:35.736
We've all been sitting
around the last few months,

32:35.866 --> 32:37.477
acting like those
talismans were a solution.

32:37.607 --> 32:40.349
Like they made us safe?

32:40.480 --> 32:43.744
Well, guess what.
We were never safe.

32:43.874 --> 32:46.181
Those talismans were a Band-Aid,

32:46.312 --> 32:48.749
a-- a temporary reprieve.

32:49.924 --> 32:51.970
Things were never okay here,

32:52.100 --> 32:55.974
and things are never
going to be okay here.

32:58.802 --> 33:03.894
We need to find a way home

33:04.025 --> 33:06.810
or else every
single person here

33:06.941 --> 33:08.769
is gonna end up
exactly like Father Khatri.

33:11.859 --> 33:14.514
There are answers out there,

33:14.644 --> 33:17.473
and you're going to find them.

33:17.604 --> 33:19.214
And in the meantime,

33:19.345 --> 33:21.869
you need to get over
what happened last night.

33:22.000 --> 33:23.218
You need to get
your shit together

33:23.349 --> 33:25.307
and be the scary hard-ass
that you've always been

33:25.438 --> 33:28.354
because that's who people
need you to be right now.

33:28.484 --> 33:32.053
And if we're not gonna fight
like hell to go home,

33:32.184 --> 33:34.664
then we might as well swallow
a fucking bullet right now.

33:36.362 --> 33:38.625
Is that what you want?

33:52.117 --> 33:54.771
I didn't know the little
bastard had that in him.

33:56.860 --> 33:58.601
Now, how about you explain

33:58.732 --> 34:00.864
what the fuck
he was talking about?

34:00.995 --> 34:02.866
Where exactly are you going?

34:02.997 --> 34:06.348
Let's take a walk.
I'll explain on the way.

34:08.089 --> 34:09.264
Come on, man!
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

34:10.918 --> 34:12.833
Come on!
Help me out a little bit here.

34:12.963 --> 34:14.052
Hey!

34:15.357 --> 34:16.924
Look what I found!

34:17.055 --> 34:19.405
Okay, what? Where--
where did you--?

34:19.535 --> 34:22.408
I-- He was about half
a mile out, eating some grass.

34:22.538 --> 34:23.974
There are chickens
out there too.

34:24.105 --> 34:25.802
Tomorrow,
I'm gonna set up some traps.

34:25.933 --> 34:26.847
There's chickens in the forest?

34:26.977 --> 34:28.022
Yep.

34:28.153 --> 34:30.111
Hey, you know what?
Grab some people.

34:30.242 --> 34:32.505
We need to start rebuilding
that, uh, pen outside the barn.

34:32.635 --> 34:33.854
Okay? Hey! Hey!

34:33.984 --> 34:34.898
Hey.

34:35.029 --> 34:36.552
-I found a goat.
-He got a goat.

34:36.683 --> 34:38.032
Yeah, that's great.

34:38.163 --> 34:40.382
Hey, uh, look,
I need to talk to you.

34:40.513 --> 34:42.210
All right. Hey, could you
take him off my hands?

34:42.341 --> 34:43.820
No.

34:43.951 --> 34:45.039
Yeah, no, you got it.
Yeah, yeah.

34:45.170 --> 34:46.606
He's not exactly what
I'd call cooperative,

34:46.736 --> 34:47.607
but just hold the rope.

34:47.737 --> 34:48.608
-Yeah.
-You got it.

34:48.738 --> 34:50.175
-I, uh...
-You believe that?

34:50.305 --> 34:52.481
I knew I was gonna find
something out in those woods.

34:52.612 --> 34:54.831
I ain't think it was gonna be
livestock, but I'll take it.

34:54.962 --> 34:55.919
Who knows what else might be--

34:56.050 --> 34:57.486
You need to stop
going out there.

34:57.617 --> 34:59.009
What?

34:59.140 --> 35:01.447
It's Mom.
She's not doing well. Okay?

35:01.577 --> 35:03.405
I mean, you've been going out
there for weeks now,

35:03.536 --> 35:05.451
and you're not seeing
what's happening here.

35:05.581 --> 35:07.888
I think this place is, like,
starting to get to her.

35:08.018 --> 35:10.325
Okay.

35:10.456 --> 35:13.502
Look, I know you're scared, man.

35:13.633 --> 35:18.333
I'm fricking terrified.
But do me a favor. Look around.

35:18.464 --> 35:21.467
The things we are doing
are working.

35:21.597 --> 35:24.034
There are things out
in those woods that can help us,

35:24.165 --> 35:27.821
things that might even--
All I know, all I know is that

35:27.951 --> 35:31.694
the second we stop looking for
answers, that's when we lose.

35:31.825 --> 35:33.479
Okay, so, then why don't
we just get someone else

35:33.609 --> 35:35.785
to go and look for a while?
Dad, we need you here.

35:35.916 --> 35:37.874
Mom needs you here!

35:38.005 --> 35:42.009
Okay, look, she-- she's not...

35:42.140 --> 35:44.142
You know, sometimes,
I-I see her just standing,

35:44.272 --> 35:46.970
staring off in the middle
of the road, like she's--

35:47.101 --> 35:50.365
Your mom... Your mom is
as tough as they come.

35:50.496 --> 35:52.628
Iron Abby, remember?

35:52.759 --> 35:56.589
Now, I know this is hard,
but this is what we have to do,

35:56.719 --> 35:58.068
at least for now.

35:58.199 --> 36:01.159
You're not even listening
to what I'm saying to you!

36:01.289 --> 36:04.031
Look, look, okay, okay.
Look, look. Look, look.

36:04.162 --> 36:07.034
We got about four hours
of daylight left, right?

36:07.165 --> 36:09.950
Help your mom get everybody
secured, tucked away.

36:10.080 --> 36:12.431
And when I get home
tonight, we will talk.

36:12.561 --> 36:14.215
I promise.

36:15.912 --> 36:17.914
Dad, please...

36:18.045 --> 36:20.352
just stay.

36:20.482 --> 36:23.311
We will talk tonight.

36:23.442 --> 36:24.747
Okay?

36:26.793 --> 36:28.751
Go help your mom.

36:52.601 --> 36:54.386
What are you doin' out here?

36:57.650 --> 37:00.783
Well, you belong to someone.

37:02.481 --> 37:03.917
Someone out here maybe?

37:08.313 --> 37:10.924
You live out here
with someone, buddy?

37:11.054 --> 37:12.621
-It's okay.

37:12.752 --> 37:15.015
It's okay.

37:16.538 --> 37:18.801
It's okay.
I'm not gonna hurt you.

37:18.932 --> 37:20.934
I just wanna get
a closer look.

37:25.547 --> 37:26.896
Hey! Hey! Hey!

37:34.164 --> 37:35.905
Hey!

37:39.300 --> 37:42.347
What the...

37:42.477 --> 37:46.002
♪

37:46.133 --> 37:49.049

38:05.283 --> 38:08.590
Fuck!

38:29.655 --> 38:31.309

38:55.028 --> 38:56.334
What the...

39:46.819 --> 39:57.046
♪

40:22.724 --> 40:24.813
Luck, not skill.

40:27.990 --> 40:30.645
Sheriff Stevens.

40:30.776 --> 40:33.474
Heard you had a rough go of it
last night.

40:36.085 --> 40:39.088
Sorry about Father Khatri.

40:39.219 --> 40:41.221
Oh, I appreciate that.

40:41.351 --> 40:42.788
I, uh...

40:44.877 --> 40:48.663
Not sure if you heard,
but I'm setting off today.

40:48.794 --> 40:50.752
Gonna find us a way
outta this place.

40:50.883 --> 40:53.363
So, in other words, you're about
to go off into the woods

40:53.494 --> 40:56.062
with no idea
what you're looking for.

40:56.192 --> 40:58.543
Because that worked
so well last time.

40:58.673 --> 40:59.587
Hey.

40:59.718 --> 41:01.241
Right?

41:01.371 --> 41:03.635
Fatima, would you
give us a second?

41:03.765 --> 41:05.593
Yeah, of course.

41:05.724 --> 41:07.029
Thank you.

41:15.081 --> 41:17.736
You wanna be angry with me,

41:17.866 --> 41:20.347
you wanna hate me, that's fine.

41:21.130 --> 41:24.351
But I'm gonna say
a couple things and, uh,

41:24.482 --> 41:28.529
and you're gonna listen,
whether you want to or not.

41:30.662 --> 41:32.794
Go ahead.

41:32.925 --> 41:34.317
If something happens
to me out there,

41:34.448 --> 41:38.452
if I don't... make it back,

41:38.583 --> 41:42.151
I never want you to regret
what you didn't say.

41:44.371 --> 41:47.069
I never want you to feel...

41:49.463 --> 41:52.814
I won't be here to
tell you that it's okay.

41:54.860 --> 41:58.690
So, I'm telling you now.

41:58.820 --> 42:02.694
Man, it's okay.

42:02.824 --> 42:06.872
And that you are my son.

42:07.002 --> 42:08.526
Mine.

42:10.092 --> 42:12.834
I love you,

42:12.965 --> 42:16.534
and I am proud of the man
that you have become.

42:18.579 --> 42:22.322
And not a single day goes by
when that hasn't been true.

42:25.455 --> 42:27.109
Okay?

42:31.026 --> 42:32.985
Yeah.

42:33.115 --> 42:35.683
Yeah, it's okay.

42:35.814 --> 42:37.555
Okay.

42:43.473 --> 42:45.127
Okay.

42:55.877 --> 42:58.314
How'd that go?

42:58.445 --> 43:00.752
About as well
as could be expected.

43:00.882 --> 43:03.276
He'll come 'round.

43:05.191 --> 43:06.584
You really going?

43:08.847 --> 43:10.283
Looks like.

43:12.764 --> 43:16.289
You and me, we've had our
differences, but I just, uh...

43:18.160 --> 43:20.380
Thank you...

43:20.510 --> 43:23.339
for looking after him.

43:23.470 --> 43:24.776
You've done
something I couldn't.

43:24.906 --> 43:26.821
You did enough, Boyd.

43:26.952 --> 43:31.086
You did more than anyone
should ever have to.

43:31.217 --> 43:33.567
So, you come back, okay?

43:33.698 --> 43:36.178
Who the hell else
am I gonna argue with?

43:37.440 --> 43:39.138
Sure you'll find someone.

43:39.268 --> 43:40.313
-Fuck off.

43:40.443 --> 43:42.184
-What?
-Come on.

43:44.012 --> 43:45.840
Now, get the fuck outta here

43:45.971 --> 43:49.017
before people start
thinking we're friends.

43:49.148 --> 43:50.279
Yes, ma'am.

44:00.159 --> 44:02.901
I'm gonna say something to you
that might make you hate me,

44:03.031 --> 44:05.294
and if it does, that's okay.

44:07.732 --> 44:10.909
What happened
wasn't your Dad's fault,

44:11.039 --> 44:14.086
and it wasn't yours.
It was this place.

44:14.216 --> 44:18.568
I wasn't here. I may not have
seen it, but I know your Dad.

44:18.699 --> 44:21.006
I know that if
there was anything,

44:21.136 --> 44:23.704
anything else he could've done,
he would've done it.

44:26.011 --> 44:29.667
What happened was so awful...

44:29.797 --> 44:33.888
it's almost inconceivable,
and it fills you with rage,

44:34.019 --> 44:35.673
rage that you needed
to put somewhere.

44:35.803 --> 44:38.414
And this whole time,
your dad let you put it on him

44:38.545 --> 44:41.679
because that's what parents do.

44:41.809 --> 44:44.551
But did you, for a second,
stop to consider

44:44.682 --> 44:47.554
what that day was like for him,

44:47.685 --> 44:52.254
what he's carried every
second of every day since?

44:59.131 --> 45:01.699
If you don't get up
and go after him right now,

45:01.829 --> 45:05.137
you're gonna regret it
for the rest of your life.

45:38.648 --> 45:39.824
What's--

45:41.216 --> 45:42.522
Babe?

45:45.003 --> 45:46.526
Ab?

45:50.008 --> 45:51.792
What's happening, Abs?

45:53.054 --> 45:54.403
What's going on, Abs?

45:58.668 --> 46:00.888
Abs?

46:01.019 --> 46:02.455
Abby?

46:02.585 --> 46:04.326
Oh, God. Oh, God.

46:05.675 --> 46:07.721
Ab--

46:07.852 --> 46:10.898
Please.
Please, why are you doing this?

46:11.029 --> 46:12.552
It's okay.

46:12.682 --> 46:16.077
It's not real.
It's a nightmare.

46:16.208 --> 46:19.559
The only way for us to go home
is to wake everyone up.

46:19.689 --> 46:22.997
It's okay.
You can't die in dreams.

46:23.128 --> 46:24.477
Everything's gonna be okay.

46:24.607 --> 46:26.914
Abby.
Abby, stop! Stop!

46:27.045 --> 46:28.524
S-s-stop.

46:28.655 --> 46:31.527
No. No.

46:31.658 --> 46:34.530
Hey. Hey.
I found something,

46:34.661 --> 46:35.793
s-something I think
is gonna help us.

46:35.923 --> 46:38.099
You didn't come back
before it got dark.

46:38.230 --> 46:39.361
There's no way you could
have survived out there,

46:39.492 --> 46:42.060
not if it was real.

46:42.190 --> 46:43.757
Yeah.

46:43.888 --> 46:47.587
It's time to wake up.
It's time to wake everybody up.

46:47.717 --> 46:50.546

Um...

48:07.623 --> 48:10.322
I've been following you
since you left town.

48:10.452 --> 48:13.412
I've been, um...

48:13.542 --> 48:15.414
I've been trying to find the
courage to say something to you.

48:19.374 --> 48:21.811
Look, last night, when, uh,

48:21.942 --> 48:23.509
those things got inside
of Colony House,

48:23.639 --> 48:27.469
Fatima and I,
we would've died.

48:28.340 --> 48:31.082
I mean, there was no way
that we could've survived that.

48:33.736 --> 48:38.132
But the one thing that saved us,

48:38.263 --> 48:40.308
that saved her...

48:42.310 --> 48:44.269
was the talisman on the door.

48:51.406 --> 48:55.193
I've just been so angry
for a really long time...

48:57.847 --> 49:00.241

49:03.592 --> 49:05.159

didn't do what you did,

if you didn't bring
those talismans back...

49:22.350 --> 49:24.048
It wasn't your fault, Dad.

49:26.659 --> 49:30.184
What Mom did,
it wasn't...

49:30.315 --> 49:32.273
It wasn't your fault.

49:35.755 --> 49:39.237
Look, I'm sorry.
Yeah, I'm so sorry, Dad.

49:39.367 --> 49:40.281
I'm so sorry.

No, no, no, hey.
Hey, no.

49:44.503 --> 49:47.245
It's okay. It's all right.

49:47.375 --> 49:49.203
I just-- I just didn't
want you to leave

49:49.334 --> 49:50.552
without saying goodbye.

49:50.683 --> 49:52.337
This is not goodbye.

49:52.467 --> 49:55.209
Okay? You hear me? Huh?

49:55.340 --> 49:57.429
This is not goodbye.

49:57.559 --> 49:58.430
Okay.

49:58.560 --> 50:00.127
All right.

50:05.393 --> 50:06.394

50:08.614 --> 50:09.919

50:10.050 --> 50:12.574

to take her with me. Okay?

50:12.705 --> 50:14.489
Wait, no, you know
what she tried to do!

50:14.620 --> 50:16.535
No, no, no! Hey, look, look.
I need to take her with me

50:16.665 --> 50:19.581
'cause she might be helpful
for us to find out

50:19.712 --> 50:21.496
what we're looking
for out there, okay?

50:21.627 --> 50:23.585
I will explain everything
to you when I get back.

50:23.716 --> 50:25.326
We'll have a long conversation,

50:25.457 --> 50:27.502
hopefully on our way
outta this place.

50:27.633 --> 50:31.550
But for now, right now, I just
need you to trust me, okay?

50:31.680 --> 50:33.856
Okay, no one can
know she's with me.

50:33.987 --> 50:35.423
Can you do that for me?

50:35.554 --> 50:38.339
Can you trust me?

50:42.648 --> 50:44.389
Just come back.

50:44.519 --> 50:46.782
Yes, sir.

50:46.913 --> 50:49.350
All right.

50:49.481 --> 50:51.787
Go on. Go.

50:51.918 --> 50:53.224
I love you.

50:55.530 --> 50:56.836
I love you, too.

50:56.966 --> 50:59.186
Okay.

51:02.450 --> 51:04.148
Yeah.

51:12.504 --> 51:14.941
Look, we're in a tight spot.

51:15.072 --> 51:17.422
No one's gonna
pretend otherwise.

51:18.118 --> 51:20.642
But Sheriff Boyd
is risking everything for us

51:20.773 --> 51:22.601
out there in the forest.

51:22.731 --> 51:24.994
The least we can do is...

51:25.125 --> 51:27.649
keep ourselves
together while he does.

51:27.780 --> 51:30.261
So that means that we're gonna
do things a little differently

51:30.391 --> 51:31.566
going forwards.

51:31.697 --> 51:34.874
No more Colony House,
no more town.

51:35.004 --> 51:37.659
We're a community, so...

51:37.790 --> 51:40.706
we do this together.

51:40.836 --> 51:43.404
All you Colony House folk,

51:43.535 --> 51:45.754
I don't want any of you
being shitty houseguests.

51:45.885 --> 51:48.888
Now, we're gonna get
the house put back together,

51:49.018 --> 51:50.846
but first of all,

51:50.977 --> 51:53.545
Jim here has an idea about
a way we might be able to get

51:53.675 --> 51:55.590
a signal to folks
back in the world.

51:55.721 --> 51:58.680
So we can either
put our energy towards

51:58.811 --> 52:00.726
boarding up a bunch
of broken windows,

52:00.856 --> 52:03.642
or we can help build
something that gets us all

52:03.772 --> 52:06.340
out of this shithole.

52:06.471 --> 52:07.341
Jim?

52:11.606 --> 52:14.653
Well, we're gonna need supplies,

52:14.783 --> 52:17.569
anything we can get
our hands on.

52:17.699 --> 52:20.441
We're gonna need batteries,
anything with a charge.

52:20.572 --> 52:23.705
But most of all,
we're gonna need people.

52:23.836 --> 52:26.534
The sooner we get this built,

52:26.665 --> 52:28.536
the sooner we can all go home.
