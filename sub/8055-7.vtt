WEBVTT

00:00.287 --> 00:02.338
Okay, everybody.
The Harvest Festival is tomorrow.

00:02.529 --> 00:06.031
And I am so proud of all of you.
You've worked so hard.

00:06.116 --> 00:07.866
You're amazing.
So I have a surprise.

00:07.951 --> 00:10.219
And it is possibly

00:10.286 --> 00:13.322
the best thing
to potentially ever happen

00:13.390 --> 00:14.890
to anyone anywhere

00:14.958 --> 00:16.675
in the history of the Universe.

00:16.743 --> 00:18.260
Ladies and gentlemen,

00:18.327 --> 00:19.528
the world famous
Little Sebastian.

00:19.596 --> 00:20.629
- What?
- Yes!

00:20.697 --> 00:21.964
No way!

00:22.032 --> 00:24.867
Little Sebastian?
Oh, my God!

00:24.934 --> 00:26.535
I never thought
I'd get to meet him.

00:26.603 --> 00:29.188
- It's really him!
- Well done, Leslie.

00:29.272 --> 00:30.856
Well done!

00:30.940 --> 00:32.641
Little Sebastian made his debut

00:32.709 --> 00:34.710
at the last
Harvest Festival in 1987.

00:34.778 --> 00:37.146
And he was an instant phenomenon.

00:37.197 --> 00:38.681
For the next few years,

00:38.748 --> 00:41.150
Sebastian was the number one
boy's name in Pawnee.

00:41.217 --> 00:43.218
And the number three girl's name.

00:43.286 --> 00:45.821
So what am I missing?
What's the deal with the pony?

00:45.889 --> 00:47.823
He's not a pony, man.
He's a mini horse.

00:47.874 --> 00:48.924
There's a big difference.

00:48.992 --> 00:51.060
Well, then why is he so famous?

00:51.127 --> 00:52.428
Does he do something?
What does he do?

00:52.495 --> 00:53.662
Son, this horse

00:53.730 --> 00:55.898
has an honorary degree
from Notre Dame.

00:55.965 --> 00:58.366
We all need to
be very careful, okay?

00:58.418 --> 01:00.869
Remember, this little guy
is 25 now.

01:00.937 --> 01:02.370
And he has cataracts in both eyes

01:02.422 --> 01:03.872
and he has severe arthritis.

01:03.923 --> 01:05.007
Jerry is going to look after him.

01:05.075 --> 01:06.241
Yes, I am.

01:06.309 --> 01:07.676
We are both on the same
diabetes medication.

01:07.744 --> 01:09.244
Are you my Glucotrol buddy?

01:09.312 --> 01:10.679
Are you? Huh?

01:10.747 --> 01:12.398
Isn't it amazing?

01:12.482 --> 01:14.283
Yeah, I just gotta be honest.

01:14.350 --> 01:15.617
I don't know
what the big deal is.

01:15.685 --> 01:18.053
Get out.

01:21.124 --> 01:31.064
<font color="#ec14bd">Sync by honeybunny</font>
<font color="#ec14bd">www.addic7ed.com.</font>

01:38.174 --> 01:39.441
Hmm.

01:39.509 --> 01:41.543
Okay, couldn't you put
Sue's salads here?

01:41.594 --> 01:43.353
On Deep Fried Boulevard?

01:43.473 --> 01:44.446
It's just...

01:44.514 --> 01:46.992
There's so many junk food places
and only one salad stand.

01:47.112 --> 01:50.152
Well, there's a lot of people
that don't consider salad a food.

01:50.905 --> 01:52.527
The Harvest Festival
is the biggest thing

01:52.647 --> 01:53.388
I've ever done in my career.

01:53.508 --> 01:55.791
And if it fails, the Parks
Department will be eliminated.

01:55.859 --> 01:57.623
That's why we're going big.

01:57.867 --> 02:00.279
Seven days,
over 30 different locations.

02:00.363 --> 02:04.099
50,000-plus visitors,
and four hospitality kiosks.

02:04.167 --> 02:06.985
God, I gotta stop
ending on that boring thing.

02:07.070 --> 02:09.170
Clowns!

02:09.239 --> 02:12.043
Man, you are just
knocking these off.

02:12.163 --> 02:15.627
You're like a ninja crossed
with a Jedi, or something.

02:15.712 --> 02:17.946
You're like a nerd mixed
with a dork or something.

02:18.014 --> 02:19.848
Tom, <i>Star Wars</i> is not that nerdy.

02:19.916 --> 02:21.850
No, <i>Star Wars</i> is not that nerdy.

02:21.918 --> 02:22.951
It's not, everyone's see it.

02:23.019 --> 02:24.002
Everyone's seen it.

02:24.087 --> 02:25.020
- Everyone.
- This guy's here.

02:25.088 --> 02:26.922
- Hey, Ken.
- Hi, Leslie.

02:26.973 --> 02:28.507
This is Ben and Tom.

02:28.591 --> 02:30.292
- That's a dope bollo.
- This is Ken Hotate.

02:30.343 --> 02:32.828
He is the tribal leader
of the Wamapoke.

02:35.064 --> 02:37.132
Ah! <i>Wahallo.</i>

02:37.200 --> 02:40.486
Have a seat.
Ken, I know why you're here.

02:40.570 --> 02:42.971
And just let me say
that we really tried.

02:43.022 --> 02:45.374
I'm sorry, Leslie,
but this is a big one.

02:45.441 --> 02:46.975
I'm under a lot of pressure.

02:47.043 --> 02:49.945
I'm gonna need to formally
ask you to move the carnival.

02:49.996 --> 02:52.314
I'm sorry?
What's going on.

02:52.382 --> 02:55.551
The carnival is on the site
of the battle of Indian Hill,

02:55.618 --> 02:58.486
which was an epic seven day
battle that the Wamapoke lost.

02:58.538 --> 03:00.956
Due to the fact that
they didn't have any weapons.

03:01.007 --> 03:03.792
During the battle,
93-year-old chief Wakote

03:03.843 --> 03:06.378
was shot 102 times
by the calvary.

03:06.462 --> 03:07.830
Did he die?

03:07.897 --> 03:09.731
Yes.

03:09.799 --> 03:11.366
And this moment
will be commemorated

03:11.434 --> 03:12.668
for the next seven days

03:12.735 --> 03:15.037
with shooting galleries
and fried dough stands.

03:15.104 --> 03:16.138
Ken, I understand.

03:16.206 --> 03:17.472
But it's the only place in town

03:17.540 --> 03:19.191
that's big enough to
house the carnival rides.

03:19.275 --> 03:20.742
Plus, you know
with Pawnee's history

03:20.810 --> 03:22.678
it's very difficult
to not be offensive.

03:22.745 --> 03:26.014
This is a map of all the
atrocities the Pawnee settlers

03:26.082 --> 03:30.018
inflicted upon
the Wamapoke Indians.

03:30.086 --> 03:32.321
The atrocities are in blue.

03:32.388 --> 03:34.189
We put up a memorial plaque,

03:34.257 --> 03:36.925
and we have a Wamapoke exhibit
in the history tent.

03:36.993 --> 03:38.544
I completely understand you.

03:38.628 --> 03:41.663
But this is sacred burial ground.

03:41.731 --> 03:44.499
And I just hope that
the souls of my ancestors

03:44.567 --> 03:48.536
don't put a curse
on this festival.

03:48.588 --> 03:50.939
There are two things
I know about white people.

03:51.007 --> 03:52.441
They love Matchbox 20,

03:52.508 --> 03:55.277
and they are terrified of curses.

03:55.345 --> 03:56.878
- Hey.
- Hey.

03:56.930 --> 04:00.182
Um, so somebody,
I don't want to say who.

04:00.233 --> 04:01.650
It was totally me.

04:01.717 --> 04:05.020
Got sweetums to donate another
15 cotton candy machines.

04:05.071 --> 04:06.755
- Ah, take that, curse.
- Take that, curse.

04:09.859 --> 04:11.760
- Ouch, ouch, ouch!
- Right in the chest, ooh!

04:11.828 --> 04:13.078
- Ow, ow, ow!
- Bazooka!

04:14.781 --> 04:17.366
Ugh! Get a room.

04:17.416 --> 04:19.750
- All right.
- Okay.

04:19.836 --> 04:21.503
Um, so guys, focus up.

04:21.571 --> 04:24.306
Joan Callamezzo is coming by
with a camera crew,

04:24.374 --> 04:26.458
for an exclusive
last-minute walk through

04:26.542 --> 04:28.710
of the Harvest Festival
before we open tomorrow.

04:28.778 --> 04:30.145
So everything
needs to be perfect.

04:30.213 --> 04:32.514
Joan is always
looking for a scandal.

04:32.582 --> 04:33.916
She's like
an eagle-eyed tiger.

04:33.983 --> 04:35.634
Eagle-eyed tiger!
New band name, I call it!

04:35.718 --> 04:37.319
So everybody gather around.

04:37.387 --> 04:38.987
- Let's grab hands.
- I don't hold hands.

04:39.055 --> 04:42.891
Okay, you're all amazing,
wonderful people.

04:42.942 --> 04:45.227
And I really want you
to have fun today.

04:45.278 --> 04:47.529
And not focus on the fact that
if one thing goes wrong,

04:47.597 --> 04:49.448
- we're all gonna lose our jobs.
- That's not inspiring.

04:49.532 --> 04:50.899
Okay, let's go get 'em everybody!

04:50.950 --> 04:53.068
Yes!

04:53.119 --> 04:56.655
Hey, whatever happened
to you and the bionic man?

04:56.739 --> 04:59.607
Chris?
He broke up with me.

04:59.659 --> 05:01.776
But he did it so nicely that I
didn't even realize he did it.

05:01.828 --> 05:04.246
I've done that to multiple men.

05:04.314 --> 05:06.298
How you doing?
You doing okay?

05:06.382 --> 05:08.616
Thank you so much for asking,
it's been tough, yeah.

05:08.668 --> 05:10.285
Two days ago I was sobbing at

05:10.336 --> 05:12.287
a pizza buffet
and they asked me to leave.

05:12.338 --> 05:14.456
I've been looking at
some dog adoption web sites.

05:14.524 --> 05:16.975
Bought $700 worth of candles
from Anthropologie.

05:17.060 --> 05:18.760
I did this to my hair.

05:18.828 --> 05:21.196
You know, your basic
bottoming out kind of stuff.

05:21.264 --> 05:23.131
Yeah.

05:23.199 --> 05:26.351
Normally, people tell you to
talk about your problems,

05:26.436 --> 05:28.470
I'm gonna recommend you
bottle that noise up.

05:28.521 --> 05:31.340
That's what my mailman said.

05:31.407 --> 05:33.859
Muah-muah-murder.

05:33.943 --> 05:35.310
Murdering the most melons.

05:35.361 --> 05:37.412
Shaquille showered shame
on Shakira's sheets.

05:37.480 --> 05:39.031
- Hello, Joan.
- Hello, Leslie.

05:39.115 --> 05:42.334
Looks like a very
impressive festival.

05:42.418 --> 05:44.319
But we'll see.

05:44.370 --> 05:46.321
We'll see.

05:46.372 --> 05:47.506
- You remember Ben?
- Hi.

05:47.590 --> 05:49.658
It's nice to see you again.

05:49.726 --> 05:52.027
- Let's get started.
- Okay.

05:52.095 --> 05:54.062
Now the festival is spread
throughout the town.

05:54.130 --> 05:55.897
But the centerpiece
is the carnival.

05:55.965 --> 05:59.701
And over here is
Indiana's largest corn maze.

05:59.769 --> 06:00.869
Ah.

06:00.937 --> 06:03.021
Is that Pawnee corn
or Eagleton corn?

06:03.106 --> 06:05.140
Pawnee corn, and it's organic.

06:05.208 --> 06:07.676
Over here we have our
beautiful ferris wheel.

06:07.744 --> 06:08.727
Ah, beautiful.

06:08.811 --> 06:10.312
But deadly.

06:10.363 --> 06:12.147
When was the last time
this giant wheel of death

06:12.215 --> 06:13.398
was inspected?

06:13.483 --> 06:15.017
Actually, twice in the last week.

06:15.084 --> 06:18.653
And everything is
100% up to code.

06:18.721 --> 06:21.189
How many of these
carnies are illegals?

06:21.240 --> 06:24.226
None, they're all U.S. citizens.

06:24.293 --> 06:26.395
Over in this booth, Indiana
basketball legend Larry Bird's

06:26.462 --> 06:28.096
84-year-old
aunt Tilda will be

06:28.164 --> 06:30.599
signing autographs
for two hours on Thursday.

06:30.666 --> 06:32.584
- You got Tilda?
- Yeah.

06:32.668 --> 06:34.870
- Oh.
- We got Tilda.

06:34.937 --> 06:37.422
But the real coup is over there.

06:37.507 --> 06:39.241
Li'l Sebastian.

06:39.308 --> 06:41.943
Are you [bleep] kidding me?

06:42.011 --> 06:45.180
- You got Li'l Sebastian?
- See for yourself!

06:45.231 --> 06:47.482
Oh, wow.
He is so adorable.

06:47.550 --> 06:50.185
Thank you, Joan.
Li'l Sebastian isn't bad either.

06:50.236 --> 06:52.854
- Tom!
- How are you?

06:52.905 --> 06:54.406
- Good.
- Good to see you.

06:54.490 --> 06:56.525
Hold on a second.

06:56.576 --> 06:57.859
Did you get your breasts done?

06:57.910 --> 06:59.961
- You look amazing.
- Yes, thanks for noticing.

07:00.029 --> 07:01.396
Joan, listen to me.

07:01.447 --> 07:03.765
This Harvest Festival,
it's gonna knock your socks off.

07:03.833 --> 07:05.417
And when it does,
I'm gonna be there

07:05.501 --> 07:06.901
to give you a foot massage...
To completion.

07:08.337 --> 07:10.572
Good lord.

07:13.176 --> 07:15.127
God, I swear, it's almost
like they don't want you to win.

07:15.211 --> 07:19.080
Well, you'd better practice.
You gotta win me a Teddy bear.

07:19.132 --> 07:21.550
I'm gonna win you
a million Teddy bears.

07:21.601 --> 07:24.386
Well, I want
a billion Teddy bears.

07:24.437 --> 07:26.555
Well, that's
a little unrealistic.

07:26.606 --> 07:30.826
This is a hard game.
Two million.

07:30.893 --> 07:31.860
Deal.

07:31.927 --> 07:33.562
All right.

07:41.437 --> 07:43.105
Hey, I love you.

07:43.172 --> 07:45.974
Dude, shut up!

07:46.042 --> 07:47.159
That is awesome sauce!

07:50.580 --> 07:51.780
You're such a good boy.

07:51.848 --> 07:53.781
Jerry, stop bothering
Li'l Sebastian.

07:53.833 --> 07:55.617
Leslie said I should
watch him for a little bit.

07:55.685 --> 07:57.419
Perfect, I've gotta go
get him a tail scrunchie.

07:57.470 --> 07:59.471
Most people look
at Li'l Sebastian

07:59.555 --> 08:02.507
and they see a famous mini horse.

08:02.592 --> 08:04.342
I see an advertising
opportunity for my club.

08:04.427 --> 08:06.761
The Snakehole Lounge.

08:06.813 --> 08:08.847
Wow, that is a shockingly
huge mini horse erection.

08:10.366 --> 08:12.434
What about your friend Ben, here?

08:12.485 --> 08:15.470
We all know his story,
one of failure.

08:15.521 --> 08:17.522
Remind us of that failure.

08:17.607 --> 08:21.142
Well, uh, you know, when
I was an 18-year-old mayor,

08:21.194 --> 08:23.478
I tried to build
a winter sports complex

08:23.529 --> 08:26.281
called Ice Town
and it bankrupted the city.

08:26.332 --> 08:27.482
Yikes.

08:27.533 --> 08:29.534
I was also short-stop
on my JV baseball team.

08:29.619 --> 08:30.719
No one ever brings that up.

08:30.786 --> 08:33.121
And now you're involved
with this.

08:33.172 --> 08:36.041
Do I smell another
disaster, hopefully?

08:36.125 --> 08:37.292
Look, Joan, this festival,

08:37.360 --> 08:39.461
thanks to the tireless
efforts of Leslie Knope,

08:39.511 --> 08:41.462
is going to bring people
nothing but happiness.

08:41.514 --> 08:43.631
Not even I could screw that up.

08:43.698 --> 08:46.518
I'm a reporter,
not your therapist.

08:46.602 --> 08:48.270
So any time someone
takes a picture of him,

08:48.337 --> 08:50.038
the Snakehole's logo is in it.

08:50.106 --> 08:52.173
Am I a genius or what?

08:52.225 --> 08:54.543
Hey, Tom.
Where's Li'l Sebastian?

08:58.197 --> 09:01.483
Uh, somebody left the gate
open and he got out, Jerry!

09:01.534 --> 09:03.518
What are you talking about?

09:03.586 --> 09:04.753
Unbelievable.

09:04.820 --> 09:06.371
Another in a long string
of miserable failures.

09:06.455 --> 09:07.656
You lost Li'l Sebastian!

09:07.723 --> 09:09.658
- I wasn't even here!
- Exactly.

09:09.725 --> 09:13.211
You look for him, I'm gonna go
tell everyone what you did.

09:13.296 --> 09:16.081
Harvest starts at 9 AM
tomorrow morning,

09:16.165 --> 09:18.366
and as far as this
reporter is concerned,

09:18.417 --> 09:20.051
it's well worth your time.

09:20.136 --> 09:23.004
Come on down, everyone.
It's gonna be sweet.

09:23.055 --> 09:25.507
It pains me to say this,
but great job here.

09:25.575 --> 09:29.744
Thank you.

09:29.812 --> 09:31.680
- That went well.
- Yeah, it did.

09:31.731 --> 09:34.482
- Take that, curse!
- Take that, curse!

09:34.550 --> 09:36.568
Sorry, what is
this about a curse?

09:36.652 --> 09:37.602
- Hmm?
- Curse?

09:37.687 --> 09:38.920
What?
What, nothing.

09:38.988 --> 09:41.022
- No, no.
- Leslie!

09:41.090 --> 09:42.941
It's Li'l Sebastian.
He's gone.

09:43.025 --> 09:44.892
Jerry let him escape and
we don't know where he is.

09:44.944 --> 09:48.396
Keep those cameras up.
We've got a new intro to do.

09:48.464 --> 09:50.098
Gotcha.

09:50.166 --> 09:52.417
Let's go ahead,
let's get some shots

09:52.501 --> 09:54.619
of chipped paint
and crying babies.

09:54.704 --> 09:56.427
How about some of those
spooky traffic lights.

09:56.547 --> 09:57.523
Okay, you know the drill.

09:58.111 --> 09:59.250
Okay, this is bad, right?

09:59.370 --> 10:00.570
This is way worse than that.

10:00.621 --> 10:01.705
This is a huge government project,

10:01.756 --> 10:03.173
and already a lightning rod.

10:03.240 --> 10:05.862
And then you add
the Wamapoke controversy.

10:05.863 --> 10:06.955
Double lightning rod.

10:06.956 --> 10:09.257
- Plus we lost that little pony.
- It's a mini horse!

10:09.325 --> 10:10.525
And that's
the third lightning rod.

10:10.576 --> 10:11.859
Triple lightning rod!

10:11.911 --> 10:13.528
And then you have the curse,
quadruple lightning rod.

10:13.579 --> 10:14.913
God, now all the vendors
are gonna bail.

10:14.997 --> 10:15.997
And the ticket sales
are gonna go down.

10:16.048 --> 10:17.399
Wait, I'm sorry.

10:17.466 --> 10:19.000
But do people in this town
really believe in curses?

10:19.051 --> 10:20.669
Oh, no.
No.

10:20.720 --> 10:22.921
We all just behave rationally
and believe

10:23.005 --> 10:24.939
we are all in charge
of our own destinies.

10:25.007 --> 10:26.074
Come on.

10:26.142 --> 10:27.359
What the heck are we gonna do?

10:27.426 --> 10:29.778
How did this happen?

10:29.845 --> 10:31.763
Maybe Li'l Sebastian got upset

10:31.847 --> 10:33.264
because he tried to share
his true feelings

10:33.349 --> 10:34.733
with someone
and they didn't reciprocate.

10:34.817 --> 10:36.051
That's not bad.

10:36.118 --> 10:39.120
Or maybe a balloon
popped somewhere,

10:39.188 --> 10:40.855
and it scared him.

10:40.923 --> 10:43.024
Sent him running off.

10:43.075 --> 10:44.359
Okay.

10:44.410 --> 10:47.062
Tom, Jerry, check the field
behind the parking lot.

10:47.129 --> 10:48.730
Andy, April, check the corn maze.

10:48.781 --> 10:51.232
Good idea.
Horses love mazes, come on!

10:51.283 --> 10:52.701
Hey, Leslie?

10:52.752 --> 10:54.569
This big, beefy dude just
came in to the first aid tent

10:54.620 --> 10:55.587
because he was dehydrated.

10:55.671 --> 10:56.871
And then a reporter came in

10:56.922 --> 10:59.207
and asked if it was
because of the curse.

10:59.258 --> 11:00.875
No comment.
Did you say, "no comment?"

11:00.943 --> 11:02.711
- You gotta say, "no comment."
- I did.

11:02.762 --> 11:04.279
Ah, good.
Anne, you're so beautiful.

11:04.346 --> 11:05.547
Beautiful Anne.

11:05.614 --> 11:06.681
All right, well, um,

11:06.749 --> 11:08.016
just treat him and release him

11:08.083 --> 11:09.350
and then don't say
anything to anyone

11:09.418 --> 11:10.852
about anything
for the rest of the month.

11:10.920 --> 11:12.103
- Okay.
- Okay, run, Anne, run!

11:12.188 --> 11:13.421
- Okay.
- Leslie?

11:13.472 --> 11:15.190
- Yeah?
- You gotta see this.

11:15.257 --> 11:16.991
The fact is, this carnival is

11:17.059 --> 11:20.094
being held on top of
an ancient Wamapoke burial site.

11:20.146 --> 11:21.663
Much like the house
in the movie, <i>Poltergeist.</i>

11:21.731 --> 11:22.864
Exactly.

11:22.932 --> 11:25.433
I spoke to Leslie Knope,
of the Parks Department,

11:25.501 --> 11:26.534
about moving the carnival.

11:26.602 --> 11:27.769
And she refused.

11:27.837 --> 11:30.772
We do have exclusive
animation of that event.

11:30.823 --> 11:33.708
Let's take a look.

11:33.776 --> 11:36.077
Oh, I love these things.
Sorry.

11:38.000 --> 11:44.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

11:47.173 --> 11:48.957
Whoa.

11:49.024 --> 11:51.993
Ah-ah-ah!

11:52.061 --> 11:53.962
Is that what happened?

11:54.029 --> 11:55.797
- Perd...
- None of that happened.

11:55.848 --> 11:57.799
That is exactly what happened.

11:57.867 --> 11:59.484
All right, all right.

11:59.568 --> 12:01.536
What we do is
we move the shooting gallery.

12:01.604 --> 12:02.821
That seems to be
their biggest problem.

12:02.905 --> 12:04.272
Maybe that will make them happy.

12:04.340 --> 12:05.807
Check back in
with news Channel 4.

12:05.875 --> 12:09.360
Number one in curse coverage.

12:09.445 --> 12:11.880
You know how Indians
call corn maize?

12:11.947 --> 12:15.283
This is why.
I never knew that.

12:15.334 --> 12:17.502
Oh, my God.
I'm gonna go look by myself.

12:17.586 --> 12:19.370
Hey, are you all right?

12:19.455 --> 12:21.856
You seem super not happy.

12:21.924 --> 12:23.258
I'm fine.

12:23.325 --> 12:24.542
Oh, I forgot to tell you.

12:24.627 --> 12:26.694
I might be going
to Venezuela tomorrow.

12:26.762 --> 12:27.712
Forever.

12:27.797 --> 12:30.131
You're not fine.

12:30.182 --> 12:32.600
Ludgate, something is
upsetting you.

12:32.668 --> 12:35.534
Why don't you just go ahead
and tell me what it is.

12:35.654 --> 12:37.739
I'm not mad at Andy.
Andy's great.

12:37.807 --> 12:39.691
I awesome sauce Andy.

12:39.775 --> 12:41.676
April! Where are you?

12:45.197 --> 12:46.681
Look left.

12:46.749 --> 12:47.816
Look right.

12:47.883 --> 12:49.367
Yeah, okay.

12:49.451 --> 12:51.536
I don't know what's sicker,
me or your body.

12:51.620 --> 12:53.221
You aren't sick.

12:53.289 --> 12:54.889
Maybe you should
check out my abs.

12:54.957 --> 12:56.057
Are you experiencing
abdominal pain?

12:56.125 --> 12:58.209
Every day at the gym.

12:58.294 --> 12:59.878
- Ew.
- Feel.

12:59.962 --> 13:04.249
Oh.

13:04.333 --> 13:05.567
What are you doing tonight?

13:05.634 --> 13:07.886
I think I'm gonna have to pass.

13:07.970 --> 13:10.088
Your loss.

13:12.141 --> 13:14.309
- Are you gonna hit that?
- Him?

13:14.376 --> 13:17.345
He isn't exactly
boyfriend material.

13:17.396 --> 13:19.063
Who said anything
about a boyfriend?

13:19.148 --> 13:23.685
Use him, abuse him, lose him.

13:23.736 --> 13:25.553
Hey, hey, hey.
Did you find him?

13:25.604 --> 13:27.856
Yeah, Jerry.
He's right here in my pocket.

13:27.923 --> 13:30.158
Damn it.
Ground mission failed.

13:30.225 --> 13:34.028
We need a bird's eye view.

13:34.079 --> 13:36.030
You want me to climb
on top of the ferris wheel?

13:36.098 --> 13:39.066
We're extremely confident
that there's no curse.

13:39.118 --> 13:40.869
And everyone's gonna have
a great time tomorrow.

13:40.920 --> 13:41.936
Okay?

13:42.004 --> 13:44.122
Wow, first Ice Town.
Now this.

13:44.206 --> 13:46.207
Bad luck really
follows you around, huh?

13:46.258 --> 13:48.910
Okay, I'd like to
start by addressing

13:48.978 --> 13:51.462
some of the false
rumors about the festival.

13:51.547 --> 13:54.582
First of all,
we have plenty of food.

13:54.633 --> 13:55.884
There's no food shortage.

13:55.951 --> 13:57.635
There are not,
as one reporter suggested,

13:57.720 --> 14:01.105
dozens of escaped convicts
meandering around the carnival.

14:01.190 --> 14:04.642
And, at no time was
any Parks Department quote,

14:04.727 --> 14:06.461
"feasting on
petting zoo animals."

14:06.528 --> 14:09.096
You were in charge of

14:09.148 --> 14:10.315
watching a tiny horse,
and you failed.

14:10.399 --> 14:12.901
Look, I'm only
gonna say this once.

14:12.952 --> 14:16.304
What if Li'l Sebastian
is on this ferris wheel?

14:16.372 --> 14:18.439
How about you
only say that never.

14:18.490 --> 14:20.608
Leslie, how big of a disaster

14:20.659 --> 14:23.945
will this be, on a scale of 9 to 10?

14:23.996 --> 14:26.180
It will not be a disaster.

14:26.248 --> 14:27.281
It will be a success.

14:27.333 --> 14:28.967
And I want to
let everyone know that,

14:29.051 --> 14:30.919
in an attempt to be sensitive
to our Wamapoke friends,

14:30.986 --> 14:34.255
we have moved the shooting
gallery, per their request.

14:34.306 --> 14:35.690
So, yes, Perd?

14:35.758 --> 14:38.026
Yeah, the statement that
this reporter has is a question.

14:38.093 --> 14:40.461
Will that be enough
to lift the curse?

14:40.529 --> 14:44.182
Perd, you know as well as I do
that there no such...

14:44.266 --> 14:46.467
Oh, my God.

14:46.518 --> 14:49.203
Crap on a spatula.

14:49.271 --> 14:50.672
It's the curse.

14:50.739 --> 14:52.106
That's exactly what it is.

14:52.157 --> 14:53.308
You know what?
It is the curse.

14:53.375 --> 14:55.209
Wait, everyone, relax, please.

14:55.277 --> 14:56.811
We'll get this up
and running in no time.

14:56.862 --> 14:57.996
- Oh.
- Whoa!

14:58.080 --> 15:00.848
- Jerry, what the hell?
- I didn't do this.

15:00.916 --> 15:03.284
Jerry's fault.
Jerry's fault.

15:03.335 --> 15:05.954
Jerry's fault!
Jerry's fault!

15:06.005 --> 15:08.823
God.
I cannot catch a break.

15:08.874 --> 15:09.924
Yeah, well, I'll help you out.

15:09.992 --> 15:11.092
- I'm gonna go.
- What?

15:11.159 --> 15:12.210
I think I'm jinxed or something.

15:12.294 --> 15:13.962
What are you talking about?

15:14.013 --> 15:15.964
Look, you were totally fine
until I got involved.

15:16.031 --> 15:18.016
So I feel like I should
probably just go, okay?

15:18.100 --> 15:19.734
I'm really sorry.

15:19.802 --> 15:21.602
I'm the curse, I think.

15:21.670 --> 15:23.838
So I'm gonna, I'm gonna,
I'm gonna get out of here. All right?

15:27.045 --> 15:30.259
If they're missing this long,
they're usually dead.

15:30.379 --> 15:31.198
Well, if that's true,

15:31.199 --> 15:32.266
then you're gonna have to answer

15:32.334 --> 15:33.834
to the whole town.
And God.

15:33.902 --> 15:36.103
Okay, you were the one
who let him out, Tom.

15:36.154 --> 15:38.272
Okay?
Now stop trying to blame me.

15:38.340 --> 15:40.474
Jerry, can you please be quiet?

15:40.542 --> 15:43.711
I can't hear myself
not talking to Andy.

15:43.778 --> 15:45.713
Ron, will you please
tell me why April is mad at me?

15:45.780 --> 15:46.880
Ron, can you please tell Andy...

15:46.948 --> 15:48.782
All of you, be quiet!

15:48.850 --> 15:51.719
Andy, she's mad because
you said "awesome sauce"

15:51.786 --> 15:53.187
instead of,
"I love you, too."

15:53.254 --> 15:55.723
April, he loves you.
Stop being a child.

15:55.790 --> 15:57.991
Tom, you're clearly
at fault here.

15:58.059 --> 16:00.527
Blaming Jerry won't save you.

16:00.595 --> 16:02.796
Jerry, we both know you were
shotgunning funnel cakes

16:02.864 --> 16:05.465
instead of watching
Li'l Sebastian.

16:05.517 --> 16:08.001
So everyone apologize
to everyone else!

16:08.069 --> 16:10.037
- I'm sorry, Tom.
- I'm sorry, Jerry.

16:10.105 --> 16:11.038
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.

16:11.106 --> 16:13.574
I do love you.

16:13.641 --> 16:15.642
You do?

16:15.694 --> 16:17.861
Yeah.

16:17.946 --> 16:21.248
That's what makes
the sauce so awesome.

16:25.036 --> 16:26.486
Aw, Jerry just farted!

16:26.538 --> 16:28.822
I'm very upset, I get nervous.

16:28.890 --> 16:31.508
Hey, Leslie.

16:31.593 --> 16:32.710
Generator's shot.

16:32.794 --> 16:34.661
No! I got the TMK-2500

16:34.729 --> 16:36.764
specifically for
the extra capacity.

16:36.831 --> 16:38.499
Wow, you know your stuff.

16:38.566 --> 16:39.633
You single?

16:39.684 --> 16:41.902
Not now, Ed.
How could that happen?

16:41.970 --> 16:44.438
All those TV crews
plugged in and overloaded it.

16:44.506 --> 16:46.306
Okay, how and where
can I get a new one?

16:46.357 --> 16:48.108
In, like, I don't know, now?

16:48.176 --> 16:50.778
There's only one place in town
that has a generator that size.

16:50.845 --> 16:53.614
You've gotta be kidding me.

16:53.681 --> 16:56.583
So...You need
to borrow a generator.

16:56.651 --> 16:59.153
Ken, I'm coming
to you on my knees.

16:59.220 --> 17:00.821
Begging for help.

17:00.889 --> 17:02.990
Much like the
early settlers of Pawnee

17:03.057 --> 17:04.358
begged the Wamapoke
200 years ago.

17:04.425 --> 17:06.059
- Ah, but that was...
- A trick.

17:06.127 --> 17:08.060
And over 50 Wamapoke
were slaughtered.

17:08.128 --> 17:09.096
I know.

17:09.164 --> 17:10.580
But this is not a trick.

17:10.665 --> 17:12.733
I am prepared to put
the Wamapoke history exhibit

17:12.800 --> 17:14.367
inside the carnival grounds.

17:14.435 --> 17:16.703
Right past
the entrance turnstile.

17:16.755 --> 17:19.473
So that you have to look at it
before you start having fun.

17:19.540 --> 17:21.141
Hm, now that's interesting.

17:21.209 --> 17:24.394
It's been really
awesome looking at you.

17:24.479 --> 17:27.146
Most carnival nurses
are total grenades.

17:27.214 --> 17:28.182
Okay, you're all set.

17:28.233 --> 17:30.918
You are free to go.

17:30.985 --> 17:35.305
Or you could stay here
and make out with h me

17:35.390 --> 17:36.774
until the lights come back on.

17:36.858 --> 17:38.442
Oh, hell yeah.

17:38.526 --> 17:40.978
Beat it, Donna.

17:41.062 --> 17:45.098
Aye, aye, captain.

17:45.166 --> 17:47.000
I'm just trying to do
something good for this town.

17:47.068 --> 17:49.369
And I'm trying to
save my friends' jobs.

17:49.437 --> 17:50.838
Can you help me out here?

17:50.905 --> 17:54.074
A native American tribe making
a deal with the government.

17:54.142 --> 17:56.543
Heh! What could go wrong?

17:56.611 --> 17:58.278
You can have
the generator, Leslie.

17:58.329 --> 17:59.296
Thank you, Ken.

17:59.380 --> 18:00.464
And I'll issue a statement

18:00.548 --> 18:02.850
saying that the curse
has been lifted.

18:02.917 --> 18:04.852
Actually, I have another idea.

18:22.353 --> 18:24.905
With that sacred ceremony,

18:24.972 --> 18:26.607
the Wamapoke curse
has been lifted.

Wow, thank you.
Intense stuff from Ken Hotate.

18:33.814 --> 18:36.983
And in other good news,
he gave us a scare,

18:37.035 --> 18:38.335
but he's back now.

18:38.419 --> 18:41.021
The one, the only,
Li'l Sebastian!

18:47.795 --> 18:49.296
We spotted him from
the top of the ferris wheel

18:49.347 --> 18:51.849
at the center of the corn maze.

18:51.933 --> 18:54.685
After the power came back on,
we went and got him.

18:54.769 --> 18:57.471
It took us four hours
to solve that maze.

18:57.522 --> 18:59.189
It took the horse 15 minutes.

18:59.274 --> 19:01.475
Jerry's still out there.

19:04.145 --> 19:06.346
I suppose I oughta
go look for him.
