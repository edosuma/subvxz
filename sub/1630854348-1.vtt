00:10.958 --> 00:12.625
In centuries past,

00:12.708 --> 00:14.875
when the world was full of mystery,

00:14.958 --> 00:17.541
and traveling was reserved
for the very few,

00:17.625 --> 00:19.833
a new form of collection was born.

00:19.916 --> 00:21.666
The cabinet of curiosities.

00:22.166 --> 00:25.208
Now, this collection
could be lodged in a building,

00:25.875 --> 00:26.708
a chamber,

00:27.666 --> 00:29.083
or a piece of furniture.

00:32.583 --> 00:35.625
In these private collections,
one would find books,

00:35.708 --> 00:40.166
paintings, or specimens
of natural and unnatural history.

00:40.250 --> 00:44.416
A dragon's tooth,
a Fiji mermaid, a unicorn's horn.

00:44.500 --> 00:46.333
And behind each of these,

00:46.416 --> 00:47.250
a story.

00:47.750 --> 00:51.125
One could encounter something
as large as a suit of armor

00:51.708 --> 00:54.166
or as small as a set of keys.

00:55.000 --> 00:57.416
The keys to a storage room.

00:58.041 --> 01:01.750
That old place where
one keeps the past… alive.

01:02.250 --> 01:07.041
The things that remind us
of our deeds, our darkness, our sins.

01:07.541 --> 01:09.541
The story today is Lot 36.

01:10.250 --> 01:11.291
And the director,

01:11.791 --> 01:13.125
Guillermo Navarro.

02:21.291 --> 02:22.875
<i>Just two hours ago,</i>

02:22.958 --> 02:27.625
<i>allied air forces began an attack</i>
<i>on military targets in Iraq and Kuwait.</i>

02:28.541 --> 02:31.333
<i>-These attacks continue as I speak.</i>

02:32.791 --> 02:34.041
<i>We have before us</i>

02:34.125 --> 02:38.458
<i>the opportunity to forge</i>
<i>for ourselves, and for future generations,</i>

02:39.333 --> 02:40.708
<i>a new world order.</i>

02:41.208 --> 02:44.583
<i>A world where the rule of law,</i>
<i>not the law of the jungle,</i>

02:44.666 --> 02:46.791
<i>governs the conduct of nations.</i>

02:47.875 --> 02:50.791
<i>When we are successful, and we will be,</i>

02:51.291 --> 02:53.958
<i>we have a real chance</i>
<i>at this new world order.</i>

02:54.041 --> 02:57.583
<i>An order in which</i>
<i>a credible United Nations</i>

02:57.666 --> 02:59.791
<i>can use its peacekeeping role</i>

02:59.875 --> 03:03.583
<i>to fulfill the promise and vision</i>
<i>of the UN standards.</i>

03:05.083 --> 03:08.666
<i>We have no argument</i>
<i>with the people of Iraq.</i>

03:08.750 --> 03:11.625
<i>Indeed, for the innocents</i>

03:12.208 --> 03:13.625
<i>caught in this conflict,</i>

03:13.708 --> 03:15.375
<i>I pray for their safety.</i>

03:17.250 --> 03:20.333
<i>Our goal</i>
<i>is not the conquest of Iraq.</i>

03:21.208 --> 03:23.125
<i>It is the liberation of Kuwait.</i>

03:23.625 --> 03:28.041
<i>It is my hope that somehow</i>
<i>the Iraqi people can, even now,</i>

03:28.916 --> 03:33.250
<i>convince their dictator</i>
<i>that he must lay down his arms,</i>

03:33.333 --> 03:36.500
<i>leave Kuwait, and let Iraq itself…</i>

03:38.125 --> 03:40.833
<i>…rejoin the family</i>
<i>of peace-loving nations.</i>

03:41.666 --> 03:44.291
<i>Thomas Paine wrote…</i>

03:46.791 --> 03:50.166
<i>…"These are the times</i>
<i>that try men's souls."</i>

03:52.291 --> 03:54.750
<i>Those well-known words</i>
<i>are so very true today.</i>

03:55.875 --> 04:00.958
<i>But even as planes</i>
<i>of the multinational forces attack Iraq,</i>

04:01.666 --> 04:04.583
<i>I prefer to think of peace, not war.</i>

04:05.916 --> 04:10.000
<i>I am convinced</i>
<i>not only that we will prevail,</i>

04:11.083 --> 04:16.083
<i>but that out of the horror of combat</i>
<i>will come the recognition</i>

04:16.166 --> 04:20.500
<i>that no nation can stand</i>
<i>against a world united.</i>

04:23.583 --> 04:26.458
<i>…our land.</i>
<i>We fought for it and won.</i>

04:26.541 --> 04:30.250
<i>These immigrants take and take,</i>
<i>and give nothing back.</i>

04:30.333 --> 04:34.083
<i>Who told them they were welcome here?</i>
<i>Who invited them in?</i>

04:34.916 --> 04:37.583
<i>We made this country,</i>
<i>fought for its freedoms,</i>

04:37.666 --> 04:39.458
<i>and they want to fit right in.</i>

04:39.541 --> 04:41.500
-Fuck yeah.
-<i>Reap the benefits.</i>

04:41.583 --> 04:43.000
<i>Loot the social programs.</i>

04:43.083 --> 04:46.333
<i>Brown rights, Black rights,</i>
<i>well, what about white rights?</i>

04:46.416 --> 04:48.625
<i>Oh no. No, we can't talk about that.</i>

04:48.708 --> 04:49.625
No, we can't.

04:49.708 --> 04:51.208
<i>We're gonna take calls soon.</i>

04:51.291 --> 04:54.125
<i>No self-righteous,</i>
<i>liberal assholes, please.</i>

04:55.083 --> 04:58.625
<i>We've got Fred from Williamsville</i>
<i>on the line. What's on your mind today?</i>

05:28.791 --> 05:29.875
Nice wheels.

05:29.958 --> 05:31.291
My pride and joy.

05:39.291 --> 05:40.916
<i>Good afternoon, everyone.</i>

05:41.875 --> 05:44.166
Don't be shy. Come to Daddy.

05:44.250 --> 05:46.458
Join your brothers and sisters.

05:46.541 --> 05:49.375
I'm Eddie, and you're in the Gold Coast.

05:49.458 --> 05:52.000
For new faces, that's long-term rentals.

05:52.083 --> 05:54.666
Folks who don't trust banks,
who stash gold bricks

05:54.750 --> 05:58.041
inside of old couch cushions,
fur coats in boxes.

05:58.125 --> 06:01.916
For some reason, they leave it all behind,
you know, the three Ds.

06:02.000 --> 06:03.000
Death,

06:03.083 --> 06:05.166
divorce, debt.

06:05.250 --> 06:08.125
Bad luck for them, good luck for you.

06:08.666 --> 06:11.250
But sometimes we roll up the door
praying for a big score

06:11.333 --> 06:13.583
only to find a pile of shit
on the other side.

06:15.083 --> 06:18.416
We're short and sweet today,
starting with lot 36.

06:18.500 --> 06:21.125
This is the one
owned for decades by the same man.

06:21.708 --> 06:26.041
May he rest in peace up there,
down there or wherever he may be.

06:26.125 --> 06:28.625
I'm just covering all the bases.

06:28.708 --> 06:30.958
-Without further ado…

06:38.000 --> 06:39.250
Yeah.

06:51.541 --> 06:53.458
A peek, a whiff.

06:54.333 --> 06:55.666
It's all you get.

07:07.125 --> 07:12.041
Let the bidding begin!

07:13.291 --> 07:14.208
All yours, Bill.

07:15.166 --> 07:16.916
And we are on the block.

07:17.000 --> 07:19.250
On the block, starting with 50.
50 going, 50 goes.

07:19.333 --> 07:20.625
-We got 50 dollars.
-100.

07:20.708 --> 07:22.583
-100 going, do I hear 150?
-150.

07:22.666 --> 07:25.708
-Oooh, one five zero, we got her once!
-175.

07:25.791 --> 07:27.583
-250.
-250 going once--

07:27.666 --> 07:29.500
-350.

07:30.083 --> 07:31.541
Routing out the competition.

07:31.625 --> 07:36.125
I got four bills, four bills I got.
400 going once, twice, three times.

07:36.208 --> 07:39.458
Sold, to the shy man
with the deep pockets.

07:41.541 --> 07:45.416
All right, everybody, start filing out.
Next one's down the hall.

07:48.875 --> 07:50.125
I heard you, Tommy.

07:50.208 --> 07:51.291
<i>Did you, fuck-nut?</i>

07:51.375 --> 07:55.000
<i>I remember telling you not to cross</i>
<i>county lines before settling in full.</i>

07:55.083 --> 07:56.541
-I haven't.
-<i>Oh.</i>

07:57.125 --> 07:59.291
<i>So, my guy eyes on you was lying?</i>

08:00.666 --> 08:05.291
-I'm here to make money, to pay you.
<i>-I want my money now, lying piece of shit.</i>

08:05.375 --> 08:06.583
Pay phone's outside.

08:06.666 --> 08:09.083
<i>-You've gotta give me some room.</i>
<i>-Sure.</i>

08:09.166 --> 08:11.458
-I'm handling it.
-<i> Better have it tonight, motherf--</i>

08:14.541 --> 08:15.875
You got that contract?

08:20.708 --> 08:22.416
Your cut from the last unit.

08:23.375 --> 08:24.750
Did it bear fruit?

08:24.833 --> 08:28.166
Stones were made of glass,
melting the gold yielded some.

08:28.250 --> 08:32.583
-Looks light. What about the wooden canes?
-Replicas. Shitty wooden resin.

08:33.166 --> 08:35.250
That's minus the legwork and gas money.

08:35.333 --> 08:38.791
Guess that's why you got the truck
and I ride a busted moped.

08:43.083 --> 08:47.208
-I'll cut you a check for the unit.
-Get the fuck out of here. A check.

08:47.291 --> 08:48.916
You better get me my money.

08:50.375 --> 08:51.291
A check.

09:05.000 --> 09:08.250
-That's slick.
-Got any idea how much I make an hour?

09:09.000 --> 09:10.041
Got my keys?

09:11.083 --> 09:13.416
Before we get to that,
I wanna show you something.

09:15.250 --> 09:16.166
Here it is.

09:16.250 --> 09:19.666
Check this out. You gotta see.

09:22.666 --> 09:25.083
This is the guy
that owns the one you bought.

09:25.166 --> 09:26.083
Every day,

09:27.000 --> 09:27.916
same guy.

09:28.541 --> 09:29.875
Carrying the same bag.

09:30.458 --> 09:33.166
Stayed in there for an hour,
hour-and-a-half.

09:33.250 --> 09:35.708
-And then…
-What's this got to do with me?

09:35.791 --> 09:36.875
Ain't you curious?

09:36.958 --> 09:40.875
No, I'm not, and I've never been.
Maybe that's why I'm still alive.

09:43.166 --> 09:44.541
You gotta be shitting me.

09:45.125 --> 09:47.375
Guy's had it
since this place opened.

09:47.458 --> 09:49.250
Going back to '45.

09:49.333 --> 09:51.583
Kept mostly to himself, polite,

09:52.166 --> 09:53.958
tighter than a Tupperware lid.

09:54.541 --> 09:55.416
White anger.

09:55.500 --> 09:58.125
White anger…
Am I allowed to say Black anger?

09:59.000 --> 10:00.083
I didn't think so.

10:03.416 --> 10:06.833
Anyway, something special in there,
for him to check on it like this?

10:06.916 --> 10:09.041
Yeah, old clothes and worn-out shoes.

10:09.541 --> 10:12.250
I bought a unit in Palmetto
packed with jars.

10:13.083 --> 10:16.125
Urine, feces, hair, and toenails.

10:16.208 --> 10:20.041
And bags and bags of coupons.
The older we get, the stranger, man.

10:24.250 --> 10:25.125
Now look.

10:25.208 --> 10:27.250
Bag's empty when he comes out.

10:27.333 --> 10:31.333
-Of course, it's a fucking storage unit.
-Yeah, but what was he up to?

10:31.416 --> 10:34.458
He dropped something in there.
Every day for decades.

10:36.208 --> 10:37.791
Here's with the hopping again.

10:39.666 --> 10:40.791
What do you think it is?

10:40.875 --> 10:43.041
I'll dig around.

10:51.458 --> 10:52.791
For your lot 36.

10:54.333 --> 10:55.208
Enjoy.

11:01.250 --> 11:03.208
Remember, I'm the one tipped you off.

11:04.541 --> 11:06.083
Don't forget to spread the love.

11:09.166 --> 11:10.416
Stingy bastard.

11:28.583 --> 11:31.250
<i>The skies over Baghdad</i>
<i>are illuminated tonight</i>

11:31.333 --> 11:34.291
<i>as allied forces</i>
<i>unleash an assault. Another…</i>

11:34.375 --> 11:37.416
Hello, Mr. Eddie. I came to pay my bill.

11:37.500 --> 11:38.875
Two months.

11:40.750 --> 11:43.583
Uh, I thought you left the unit.

11:44.250 --> 11:47.458
Gave it up. We sold it
on the block when we didn't hear from you.

11:47.541 --> 11:49.500
Oh, no, no, no.

11:50.750 --> 11:51.791
Mr. Eddie,

11:53.208 --> 11:55.500
how long I am renting here?

11:55.583 --> 11:58.083
We sent you
an eviction notice, Ms. Amelia.

11:58.166 --> 12:01.541
-Your phone was disconnected.
-I telled you, I moved.

12:02.041 --> 12:03.750
I have a new number.

12:04.375 --> 12:07.958
Maybe you sent the notice
to the older address.

12:08.041 --> 12:10.291
-The wrong one.
-Well, whose fault is that?

12:10.375 --> 12:11.375
You!

12:11.458 --> 12:15.458
I called. I said,
"Please, Mr. Eddie, don't forget."

12:17.166 --> 12:18.125
That was…

12:25.458 --> 12:27.125
You see that guy right there?

12:29.333 --> 12:30.875
His name is Nick Appleton.

12:31.500 --> 12:32.583
He bought your unit.

12:34.458 --> 12:35.500
Go see him.

12:35.583 --> 12:38.333
Maybe you can get
some of your things back.

12:39.083 --> 12:39.958
Hmm.

12:40.708 --> 12:42.708
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

12:42.791 --> 12:43.958
Thank you very much.

12:45.458 --> 12:46.500
I'm sorry.

12:54.375 --> 12:56.000
Eyes on me.

12:59.041 --> 13:00.208
Mr. Appleton?

13:01.708 --> 13:04.166
-Mr. Appleton? Mr. Appleton.
-Whoa!

13:04.250 --> 13:07.458
Sorry. My name is Amelia,
Mr. Eddie said you bought my unit.

13:07.541 --> 13:10.583
-It's on the other side. Number 87.
-What if I did?

13:10.666 --> 13:11.875
They made mistake.

13:12.458 --> 13:15.958
-Who's they? You were evicted, right?
-They send wrong address.

13:16.041 --> 13:19.625
-Talk to the manager.
-No. Mr. Eddie said I speak to you.

13:19.708 --> 13:21.583
Fucker.

13:21.666 --> 13:22.958
Is that right?

13:23.041 --> 13:26.250
-Speak fast, this ear.
-All my family things are there.

13:26.333 --> 13:29.083
Uh, letters, photos,
personal stuff, you know?

13:29.583 --> 13:33.125
Well, I threw a lot of stuff away
and sold some others.

13:33.208 --> 13:37.125
There may be some stuff left in there,
but whatever is in there is mine now.

13:37.208 --> 13:39.791
No, it's not yours.

13:42.166 --> 13:45.250
-Where are you from?
-My name is Amelia, and I am from here.

13:45.333 --> 13:46.625
I took two buses.

13:46.708 --> 13:51.208
Legally, you lost whatever is in there.
I'm sorry, but that's just the way it is.

13:51.291 --> 13:55.125
All my children's pictures.
My mama, my papa's letters.

13:55.208 --> 13:57.500
What good are they to you, Mr. Appleton?

13:57.583 --> 14:00.416
You let me look around
and I bother nobody.

14:00.500 --> 14:03.166
Maybe some things are still there,
and I'll go quick.

14:03.250 --> 14:05.708
I'm sorry for your troubles,
but they're not mine.

14:06.541 --> 14:08.375
You can do nothing for me?

14:11.458 --> 14:14.041
A thousand bucks.
You can have what's left there.

14:14.125 --> 14:16.875
I make this money in a month, cleaning.

14:22.166 --> 14:23.083
Here.

14:25.250 --> 14:28.000
This is yours, I bet you can still use it.

14:33.708 --> 14:35.208
What's that?

14:36.833 --> 14:38.083
Do you speak Spanish?

14:38.166 --> 14:40.166
No. And clearly you don't speak English.

14:40.250 --> 14:44.375
Make an effort when you're in my country
and try and insult me in my own language.

14:44.458 --> 14:45.458
Dumb bitch.

14:46.958 --> 14:48.833
I said I hope you rot in hell!

14:55.083 --> 14:57.000
As usual, it's all on me.

14:57.666 --> 14:58.708
All on me.

14:59.333 --> 15:01.125
Like I don't have enough problems.

15:02.250 --> 15:03.625
I don't need this shit.

15:47.041 --> 15:49.375
-It's always something with this shit.

15:49.458 --> 15:52.875
If it ain't the rain, it's the pipe.
I gotta get a new job.

15:55.666 --> 15:56.833
Hey, Eddie.

15:58.333 --> 16:01.000
The unit I got is a lot smaller than this.

16:01.083 --> 16:05.125
What you talking about? Ain't planning
on getting a discount on account of size?

16:05.208 --> 16:06.875
What made you so cheap, man?

16:06.958 --> 16:10.125
Smaller space, fewer items.
All's I'm saying.

16:10.625 --> 16:12.666
Nothing's up to code in this section.

16:13.750 --> 16:17.416
It was built in the 1940s.
Units were wider, deeper, steeper.

16:17.916 --> 16:19.791
Connected to each other.

16:22.166 --> 16:23.750
I don't know what the fuck is…

16:25.541 --> 16:27.875
Excuse me. I gotta get a mop.

16:30.916 --> 16:32.541
That lady Amelia's sitting outside.

16:32.625 --> 16:35.333
Yeah, thanks for ambushing me
with that, by the way.

16:35.416 --> 16:38.083
Let the lady see if any
of her stuff's left, for Christ's sake.

16:38.166 --> 16:40.416
I'm not buying into
being the bad guy here,

16:40.500 --> 16:41.833
especially not from you.

16:41.916 --> 16:44.000
Don't be a hypocrite like everyone else.

16:44.083 --> 16:46.375
Hey, look. You and me got our thing going?

16:46.458 --> 16:50.500
Okay. I got my stuff on the side, sure,
but this lady? She's too good.

16:50.583 --> 16:53.791
The game has rules.
You win some, you lose some.

16:53.875 --> 16:56.708
Look at me.
I did what I had to for this country.

16:56.791 --> 16:59.583
How the fuck do you bring that
into every conversation?

16:59.666 --> 17:03.666
Because it bears fucking repeating!
The game I played was rigged.

17:03.750 --> 17:07.500
Lost this ear except
for high-pitched ringing day in, day out.

17:07.583 --> 17:09.375
Fine. Wife? Gone.

17:09.458 --> 17:11.583
I'll take all the losses.
But now it's my turn.

17:11.666 --> 17:14.500
You're not the only one
that feels fucked, brother.

17:15.333 --> 17:18.291
Rigged? The front line
is all Black and Brown.

17:18.375 --> 17:21.333
Maybe you didn't recall all
the dark-skinned bodies you stepped over

17:21.416 --> 17:23.250
on your way to take a leak
in the Perfume River.

17:23.333 --> 17:25.541
I bought that unit fair and square.

17:25.625 --> 17:29.250
So fuck you,
fuck her, and fuck this guilt trip!

17:33.166 --> 17:36.916
-And in my unit, everyone was green.

17:38.791 --> 17:39.625
Pfft.

20:48.875 --> 20:50.791
-Fuck me blue!

21:40.166 --> 21:41.750
Twelve K, tomorrow.

21:43.916 --> 21:45.583
You made your fucking point.

21:48.625 --> 21:49.875
Now I made my point.

21:52.833 --> 21:53.833
Fuck.

22:01.916 --> 22:03.333
Dammit.

22:07.125 --> 22:08.333
Shoo!

22:09.833 --> 22:11.083
Shoo!

22:27.958 --> 22:29.041
Fucking hell.

22:34.750 --> 22:35.625
Oh!

22:36.375 --> 22:38.166
The fuck happened to you?

22:38.250 --> 22:40.208
I'm borrowing your first aid kit.

22:43.708 --> 22:46.125
-Maybe you should sit for a minute.
-What?

22:46.833 --> 22:50.250
Why? I'm fine.
I gotta get some shit appraised.

22:51.125 --> 22:54.666
-Must be something good.
-Antique pieces, some gold.

22:57.458 --> 23:00.125
Maybe you should skip
the five-and-dime this time.

23:00.625 --> 23:03.166
Go over to Agatha's joint
on Douglas Drive.

23:07.666 --> 23:08.541
She's good people.

23:08.625 --> 23:11.625
Don't be hostile with your big,
weird eyes, and your bloody head.

23:11.708 --> 23:12.666
Fuck off.

23:14.375 --> 23:16.125
You need a chill pill, Nick.

23:49.666 --> 23:52.666
It's gold, sure,
but I'll only pay scrap for it.

23:53.291 --> 23:55.291
Eddie said you'd do better for us.

23:56.250 --> 23:58.416
Sure, if you guys do better for me.

23:59.708 --> 24:00.708
Look at this.

24:01.291 --> 24:05.083
No certified marks on the metal,
craftsmanship's crude.

24:07.583 --> 24:09.000
Can't even dress it up.

24:11.541 --> 24:12.666
Next, please.

24:12.750 --> 24:15.666
The table and chairs are good.
That inlay is real.

24:16.833 --> 24:18.375
Now those are excellent.

24:22.000 --> 24:23.541
It's a séance table.

24:23.625 --> 24:26.208
Like Ouija-board séance?

24:28.000 --> 24:29.833
A bit more serious than that.

24:38.875 --> 24:40.875
What have we here?

24:46.166 --> 24:47.333
Have you ever seen a--

24:49.416 --> 24:50.541
Yes.

24:52.916 --> 24:55.000
"<i>Liber Primus, Daemonia.</i>"

24:57.541 --> 24:59.125
"<i>Liber Secundus,</i>

24:59.208 --> 25:00.375
<i>Symvolia."</i>

25:05.833 --> 25:07.291
<i>"Liber Tertius,</i>

25:08.000 --> 25:09.416
<i>Perilipsi."</i>

25:12.666 --> 25:13.833
What does it mean?

25:13.916 --> 25:16.500
They're important, right? Valuable, I bet.

25:17.750 --> 25:18.708
Not my province.

25:19.208 --> 25:20.291
Whose then?

25:21.833 --> 25:23.541
I have an associate in mind.

25:30.583 --> 25:31.625
And this…

25:32.416 --> 25:34.625
-I've never seen one like it.
-I have.

25:35.250 --> 25:36.541
Many times.

25:37.583 --> 25:38.916
Feel. She's a beauty.

25:42.750 --> 25:44.666
Gently. It gets brittle.

25:46.583 --> 25:47.791
Try. Touch.

25:51.958 --> 25:53.416
Can you guess the material?

25:55.708 --> 25:56.541
Wool.

25:57.875 --> 25:58.875
Human hair.

25:59.375 --> 26:00.208
Smell.

26:00.291 --> 26:01.958
Yeah. No thanks.

26:03.125 --> 26:05.083
I'll go call my guy about the books.

26:22.375 --> 26:24.833
Roland. It's Agatha.

26:24.916 --> 26:28.166
-Jesus Christ.
-I'm at the store.

26:28.250 --> 26:31.583
I have a client here
with some very interesting items.

26:33.083 --> 26:35.041
Right up your alley, know what I mean?

26:36.458 --> 26:37.333
Come quickly.

26:39.250 --> 26:40.083
Trust me.

26:52.541 --> 26:54.333
<i>Hallo</i>, my dear.

26:54.416 --> 26:55.791
How's it going?

26:55.875 --> 26:56.791
Mmmwah!

26:56.875 --> 26:58.416
This is Nick.

26:58.500 --> 27:00.166
Ah, hello. Hello.

27:00.250 --> 27:02.333
Take a look. What do you think?

27:02.416 --> 27:03.583
Ah…

27:04.833 --> 27:08.166
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Very interesting. Yeah.

27:08.833 --> 27:09.791
This is

27:10.541 --> 27:11.625
indeed

27:12.791 --> 27:14.708
a séance table.

27:15.458 --> 27:18.208
-It's exquisite.
-Nineteenth century Austria.

27:19.250 --> 27:20.416
The wood is

27:21.458 --> 27:24.208
white cedar and sandalwood,

27:24.291 --> 27:25.583
treated in a very…

27:26.833 --> 27:28.166
unique way.

27:28.250 --> 27:33.041
And arranged to facilitate
the summoning of an entity.

27:34.875 --> 27:36.333
-You see?

27:36.416 --> 27:38.708
The reddish tint on the lacquer? Huh?

27:40.291 --> 27:42.166
Guess what went into it? Hey?

27:43.833 --> 27:44.791
Sick fucks.

27:52.291 --> 27:53.166
My God.

27:54.666 --> 27:56.166
I knew you'd be thrilled.

27:56.875 --> 27:57.708
Oh!

28:00.791 --> 28:02.583
Was there a fourth volume?

28:03.500 --> 28:04.708
Not that I saw.

28:04.791 --> 28:07.625
But… it's possible you could have it?

28:07.708 --> 28:10.000
Well,
I've barely touched the unit.

28:10.083 --> 28:12.125
There's a life's worth of crap in there.

28:12.208 --> 28:15.791
The books are extremely rare.

28:15.875 --> 28:17.833
I would say 10,000 for all three.

28:19.000 --> 28:19.916
Well, well.

28:20.875 --> 28:22.208
How much for all four?

28:22.291 --> 28:26.125
If placed at the right auction,
with multiple buyers,

28:27.000 --> 28:30.250
in excess of $300,000.

28:32.166 --> 28:34.833
You see, the fourth volume
is the rarest one.

28:36.000 --> 28:39.583
<i>Liber Quartus Sacramentum.</i>

28:39.666 --> 28:41.666
The most desirable piece.

28:43.000 --> 28:44.583
It's legendary.

28:45.166 --> 28:48.458
Full of symbols and spells
to bind a demon,

28:48.541 --> 28:50.000
to make it earthbound.

28:50.625 --> 28:51.458
<i>Ja?</i>

28:52.083 --> 28:53.208
A demon?

28:53.708 --> 28:57.208
The reason the…
the fourth volume is the rarest

28:58.125 --> 29:02.875
is because it burns down completely
at the end of the transaction

29:03.750 --> 29:05.666
with the purveyor of its favors.

29:06.625 --> 29:08.416
Except when…

29:11.666 --> 29:16.208
-Cut the fuckin' drumroll, will you?
-You've got a tough case here, Rolly.

29:16.291 --> 29:21.375
Except when the demon has been betrayed.
Therefore, unable to collect its debt.

29:23.000 --> 29:25.208
This transaction has to happen tonight.

29:27.291 --> 29:33.166
This is the payment for the candelabra,
the table, and the chairs.

29:33.250 --> 29:37.083
But the wreath I donate to you,
<i>mein liebshe, </i>Agatha.

29:38.125 --> 29:40.166
For the referral, <i>danke schön.</i>

29:40.708 --> 29:41.541
But…

29:42.458 --> 29:44.666
if we find the missing fourth volume,

29:46.458 --> 29:50.125
I will write you a check for $300,000.

29:54.875 --> 29:58.083
My truck's outside.
I'll drive us over there.

30:08.625 --> 30:11.416
Thank you. Thank you.
-Mm.

30:13.041 --> 30:14.500
Thank you very much.

30:17.791 --> 30:18.833
Great.

30:18.916 --> 30:22.500
Now we're getting ass fucked
with rain on top of all this shit.

30:22.583 --> 30:25.708
Did you, uh, hurt your head
on the windshield?

30:26.541 --> 30:28.833
Yeah. When I was rear-ended.

30:30.458 --> 30:33.875
Uh, do you mind closing,
uh, the side window, please?

30:39.166 --> 30:40.333
I, uh…

30:41.333 --> 30:43.458
I have a confession to make.

30:44.041 --> 30:45.166
Jesus, really?

30:46.625 --> 30:49.666
You see, I know all about the family

30:50.416 --> 30:52.500
who owned the unit that you bought.

30:55.125 --> 30:56.625
They were very rich,

30:56.708 --> 30:59.166
made their money from steel in Europe,

30:59.250 --> 31:02.458
and emigrated to America
at the end of World War II.

31:02.541 --> 31:04.208
They made weapons.

31:04.291 --> 31:05.916
Wolfram for tanks.

31:07.916 --> 31:09.208
But for the wrong side.

31:09.291 --> 31:13.166
Yeah, I saw some old war photos
in a photo album in there.

31:13.250 --> 31:14.541
Whoever this guy was.

31:14.625 --> 31:16.875
I hate to disabuse you
on your relative notion

31:16.958 --> 31:17.958
of good and evil,

31:18.041 --> 31:22.208
but this man knew and did evil
on a scale almost absolute.

31:22.708 --> 31:24.250
Well, God's got him now.

31:26.000 --> 31:26.833
Ah, yes.

31:27.416 --> 31:28.333
God.

31:28.416 --> 31:30.041
Silent, strong type

31:30.125 --> 31:33.791
that loves to see us squirm
with free will and other delusions.

31:34.958 --> 31:37.166
But what about his adversary? Huh?

31:37.750 --> 31:39.875
Relentless, feisty even.

31:40.666 --> 31:44.000
You know, whispering in our ears
at every waking moment. Huh?

31:45.166 --> 31:46.166
Something tells me

31:46.250 --> 31:49.875
you traffic in the wrong,
feisty side yourself there, Hans.

31:50.958 --> 31:53.291
Is this relevant to this transaction?

31:59.250 --> 32:01.875
The owner of the unit was a sick man.

32:03.000 --> 32:05.958
Gambled his fortune away,
destroyed his family,

32:06.625 --> 32:08.375
never had enough of anything.

32:09.500 --> 32:11.666
Bottomless appetites.

32:12.833 --> 32:14.125
You understand?

32:14.750 --> 32:16.458
Yeah, another empty asshole.

32:17.625 --> 32:18.541
That's right.

32:19.916 --> 32:24.541
He moved in occult circles
in Berlin and Vienna.

32:26.416 --> 32:28.833
And he invoked an entity.

32:29.583 --> 32:32.041
Offered it a vessel to occupy.

32:32.875 --> 32:33.875
To possess.

32:35.791 --> 32:36.833
His sister.

32:39.583 --> 32:40.583
Dottie Wolmar,

32:41.250 --> 32:42.083
I believe

32:42.791 --> 32:43.666
was her name.

32:45.208 --> 32:46.125
It was…

32:46.625 --> 32:47.791
quite the scandal.

32:48.708 --> 32:50.166
Did they ever find her?

32:50.916 --> 32:53.041
No. They searched but…

32:55.000 --> 32:56.083
it was futile.

32:57.291 --> 32:58.541
All right, enough.

32:58.625 --> 33:01.916
I'm not interested in any
of this creepshow shit you favor, okay?

33:02.000 --> 33:03.083
Anyway, we're here.

33:05.875 --> 33:06.708
Here.

33:07.333 --> 33:09.666
You've gotta be kidding me, put that away.

33:09.750 --> 33:10.583
No, no, no, no.

33:10.666 --> 33:15.083
The molten metal was collected
from a very peculiar source.

33:15.166 --> 33:16.541
Bit by bit.

33:16.625 --> 33:18.166
You see, if we find the book,

33:18.250 --> 33:20.833
the light from the candelabra
will yield protection.

33:20.916 --> 33:23.083
No offense, but shut the fuck up.

33:24.416 --> 33:25.416
Huh.

33:36.166 --> 33:37.583
You take the left side.

33:37.666 --> 33:39.750
We don't leave until we find it.

33:39.833 --> 33:42.291
Books don't spontaneously combust.

34:15.500 --> 34:16.625
Ah<i>, </i>shit!

34:32.625 --> 34:35.250
You take anything
out of here, I'm gonna know.

34:35.333 --> 34:36.708
And there's only one exit.

35:32.208 --> 35:33.375
Yeah, yeah.

35:39.416 --> 35:41.541
Where are you, Dottie Wolmar?

36:20.541 --> 36:21.375
Ah, fuck!

36:22.333 --> 36:23.666
It's hollow.

36:23.750 --> 36:25.000
You heard that?

36:31.541 --> 36:34.333
I knew
these fucking measurements were off.

36:35.291 --> 36:37.166
-Help me with this thing.
-Yes.

36:50.750 --> 36:52.625
You know that book's locked in here.

37:06.791 --> 37:09.291
Now we'll find out
why he came here every day.

37:14.375 --> 37:15.458
Oh!

37:15.541 --> 37:17.708
What is that fucking smell?

37:17.791 --> 37:20.833
-In my field, we call it effluvia.
-Oh, man.

37:20.916 --> 37:24.333
You know, like when a cat
or a dog mark their territory.

37:25.166 --> 37:28.291
Do not touch anything.

37:28.958 --> 37:30.833
Do not say anything.

37:30.916 --> 37:35.041
-Follow my precise instructions, please.
-You platoon leader now?

37:35.125 --> 37:37.958
If anything not from the natural world

37:38.041 --> 37:40.416
is found on the other side
of this threshold,

37:41.041 --> 37:43.166
I have one piece of advice for you.

37:43.875 --> 37:48.875
Do not make eye contact with it,
do not speak with it.

37:48.958 --> 37:51.583
It will sense the dark in you as I do.

37:52.166 --> 37:55.250
It will be greedy for it, hungry.
Do you understand?

37:55.333 --> 37:57.916
I'm pretty sure
that's two pieces of advice,

37:58.000 --> 37:59.666
and you don't know shit about me.

37:59.750 --> 38:00.583
So fuck off.

38:45.541 --> 38:48.166
It fucking smells horrible.

38:48.250 --> 38:49.666
God dammit.

39:05.208 --> 39:06.708
Unbelievable.

39:12.000 --> 39:14.333
Never in my imagination.

39:15.541 --> 39:17.583
He trapped his poor sister.

39:18.500 --> 39:19.541
Must be weak.

39:20.250 --> 39:21.875
Starving. Poor thing.

39:24.125 --> 39:27.125
It was pinned
inside the circle for so long, see?

39:27.625 --> 39:30.625
-The hair is fused to the floor.

39:30.708 --> 39:33.541
Look. Look how the demon writhes.

39:34.666 --> 39:37.625
See, it took her face as a way in.

39:38.833 --> 39:41.541
-There it is.
-Do not cross that line.

39:42.333 --> 39:46.041
-Fuck this, I'm going for the book.
-No, stop, don't!

39:48.375 --> 39:50.875
You have no idea
what you've awakened!

40:15.583 --> 40:17.375
Holy mother of God.

40:17.958 --> 40:18.875
Dottie.

41:23.166 --> 41:24.458
Oh, fucking hell!

41:32.958 --> 41:35.708
Oh, thank God.
Could you please open the door?

41:37.958 --> 41:39.875
Could you open the door, please?

41:41.291 --> 41:42.958
Can you open the door, please?

41:43.041 --> 41:44.958
Open the door, please!

41:45.541 --> 41:46.375
Thank you.

41:50.750 --> 41:52.708
No! No, please!

41:52.791 --> 41:55.458
I'm in danger here, I need your help!

41:55.541 --> 41:57.708
Please! Open the door!

41:57.791 --> 41:58.666
No!

41:58.750 --> 42:02.416
Please! I'll give you whatever you want,
anything you want! Please!

42:03.083 --> 42:05.375
Please! Open the door!

42:06.958 --> 42:09.416
Open the door, please!

42:10.000 --> 42:11.291
Open the door!

42:11.375 --> 42:13.875
Please! Please!

42:49.666 --> 42:52.916
My career as an artist ended
the moment I saw your work.

42:53.500 --> 42:55.041
Do you feel it, Will?

42:55.125 --> 42:56.666
-The fear.

42:56.750 --> 42:59.625
Youse telling me
rats is stealing bodies out of coffins?

43:00.916 --> 43:03.333
I've seen a forest
that takes the dead inside.

43:03.416 --> 43:05.833
-We need to get back there.

43:06.833 --> 43:09.833
-This house gives me the creeps.
-I'm very worried about you!

43:12.041 --> 43:15.416
-I don't think you should use that lotion.
-This is what's gonna fix me!

43:16.125 --> 43:19.083
Tonight, I'm gonna gift you
a singular experience.

43:19.875 --> 43:21.375
What am I gonna find?

43:24.000 --> 43:26.500
Did that just happen?

43:28.000 --> 43:29.083
Oh God!

43:36.208 --> 43:38.583
The darkness has a way
of catching me.
