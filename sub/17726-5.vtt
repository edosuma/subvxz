- Previously on
"Vanderpump Rules"...

00:03.471 --> 00:04.638
- If you were to say
to me right now,

00:04.672 --> 00:06.407
"Katie, I apologize
for calling you a whore,"

00:06.440 --> 00:09.210
I'd be like, "Girl, we're good."
- I don't apologize for that.

00:09.243 --> 00:10.878
I'm sitting here with someone
pretending

00:10.911 --> 00:14.182
that they haven't
had a married boyfriend.

00:14.215 --> 00:16.217
- I don't feel like I've ever
really been able to express

00:16.250 --> 00:18.919
to her
just how much I die inside

00:18.952 --> 00:20.488
when she goes to the dark side.

00:20.521 --> 00:22.223
- Right.
- It kills the Schwartz.

00:22.256 --> 00:25.093
- Are you sure you want
to get married this summer?

00:25.126 --> 00:27.561
- Yeah.

00:27.595 --> 00:30.264
- Hey. Raquel is my girlfriend.

00:30.298 --> 00:31.799
We're in a long-distance
relationship.

00:31.832 --> 00:33.734
She's gorgeous.
She's like a supermodel.

00:33.767 --> 00:35.769
You're just so perfect.

00:35.803 --> 00:38.005
- Hey, you're perfect.
- Oh, no, I'm not.

00:38.038 --> 00:39.973
- Do you want to start
a problem with me

00:40.007 --> 00:41.342
because you hooked up
with me and you--

00:41.375 --> 00:43.244
- No. I didn't hook up
with you ever.

00:43.277 --> 00:45.446
You're gonna get fired,
you dumb f---ing little girl.

00:45.479 --> 00:46.847
- Shut up. He's drunk.

00:46.880 --> 00:49.417
- You turned into,
like, a drunken asshole.

00:49.450 --> 00:52.052
You are not working
for me any longer.

[Dena Deadly's
"Raise Your Glass"]

00:56.424 --> 00:59.960
- * You know
that it's our time *

01:00.128 --> 01:02.396
* These are the best days

01:02.430 --> 01:04.798
* Of our lives

01:04.832 --> 01:08.836
* Just raise
your glasses high *

01:08.869 --> 01:13.974
* This one's
for you tonight *

01:14.007 --> 01:17.678
- * Nothin' is better
than you and I together *

01:17.711 --> 01:20.581
* I just wanna stay

01:20.614 --> 01:22.683
- We're really doing it.
- Finally.

01:22.716 --> 01:26.454
After weeks of planning
and preparation

01:26.487 --> 01:28.456
and phone calls
and emails,

01:28.489 --> 01:31.625
finally, we get to go
to the wedding venue,

01:31.659 --> 01:35.163
and this is the moment
I've been waiting for, mostly.

01:40.468 --> 01:42.570
- Lookit, we could get a limo
and get married right now,

01:42.603 --> 01:44.572
save a ton of money, and then
travel the world with that cash.

01:44.605 --> 01:47.275
- No--but I have a dress.
- Well, I mean,

01:47.308 --> 01:48.942
you could just take it back.

01:51.379 --> 01:52.713
- I can't wait to get there.

01:52.746 --> 01:56.317
I expect it to be blue skies
and smooth sailing

01:56.350 --> 01:58.586
and, you know, make it
the wedding of our dreams.

01:58.619 --> 01:59.920
[laughs]

02:02.323 --> 02:03.824
- Hey guys.
- Hi.

02:03.857 --> 02:04.925
- We chatted with you
on the phone, right?

02:04.958 --> 02:05.959
- Yes. Yeah.
- Okay, cool.

02:05.993 --> 02:07.195
- Hi, Katie.
Nice to meet you all.

02:07.195 --> 02:08.462
- Yeah. Yeah, me too.

02:08.496 --> 02:09.530
- Well, we're so glad
that you're here.

02:09.563 --> 02:10.764
- Yeah. What a gorgeous spot.
- Yeah?

02:10.798 --> 02:12.200
- I've been waiting for this.

02:12.233 --> 02:13.801
Technically, I've been waiting,
like, six years, but--

02:13.834 --> 02:16.804
- If I had it my way,
it'd be another six years.

02:16.837 --> 02:19.840
- Oh, come on.

02:19.873 --> 02:22.710
- No. We're excited.
- Yeah. Great.

02:22.743 --> 02:25.213
- All right. Welcome.
- I'm not getting cold feet.

02:25.246 --> 02:27.080
They're a little chilly,
but they're not cold.

02:27.114 --> 02:29.450
Before today, Katie and I
haven't talked a lot

02:29.483 --> 02:31.018
about our wedding budget.

02:31.051 --> 02:34.288
I'm hoping to keep it in
the $10,000 to $15,000 range.

02:34.322 --> 02:37.725
She seems to think it's gonna
be more like $20,000.

02:37.758 --> 02:39.960
I'm worried Katie
is gonna end up

02:39.993 --> 02:41.962
wanting a Lisa Vanderpump
wedding

02:41.995 --> 02:44.632
on a, you know,
Tom and Katie budget.

02:44.665 --> 02:47.935
- All right. So this is kind
of the forest venue area.

02:47.968 --> 02:49.870
- We're lucky that we don't need
to, like, fill this space.

02:49.903 --> 02:52.039
- We're surrounded by--
- You don't have to go crazy.

02:52.072 --> 02:54.242
- Maybe a few flowers--
maybe a dozen.

02:54.275 --> 02:55.443
- Okay. What--
- Yeah. Never mind.

02:55.476 --> 02:56.677
Let's not get any flowers.

02:56.710 --> 02:58.746
I'm not allowed to make
any decisions like that

02:58.779 --> 03:00.614
or really have any input at all.

03:00.648 --> 03:02.416
- [laughs]

03:04.285 --> 03:05.419
- Hey.
- How are you?

03:05.453 --> 03:07.488
- Good. I'm Katie.
- Welcome.

03:07.521 --> 03:09.823
Nice to meet you, Katie.
- Oh, nice to meet you.

03:09.857 --> 03:11.492
- Trisha can pretty much
take you from here.

03:11.525 --> 03:13.261
- Okay. Thank you.
We'll talk to you soon.

03:13.261 --> 03:15.463
- Yeah.
- Okay, so I just set this up

03:15.496 --> 03:18.098
so you could kind of see, like,
what's included in the package.

03:18.131 --> 03:19.367
- I like the wood thing
in the middle.

03:19.400 --> 03:22.135
- I don't.

03:22.169 --> 03:24.438
I have a bit of
a vision that is--

03:24.472 --> 03:26.807
- She had a vision.
- We're already in the woods.

03:26.840 --> 03:29.577
I don't want too much of,
like, a rustic-ness.

03:29.610 --> 03:33.013
I don't think we need
to incorporate stumps.

03:33.046 --> 03:34.415
- Well, we can get
whatever you want.

03:34.448 --> 03:36.917
It would just be kind of, like,
adding the additional cost.

03:36.950 --> 03:40.288
- Did you say cost?
- Don't worry about him.

03:40.321 --> 03:43.491
Our theme of our wedding
is woodsy elegance.

03:43.524 --> 03:46.093
So it's kind of like mixing
this very elegant type wedding

03:46.126 --> 03:47.828
that would be
in a grand ballroom,

03:47.861 --> 03:49.397
but put it in nature.

03:49.430 --> 03:53.100
- How did you two meet?
- How did we meet?

03:53.133 --> 03:54.435
I don't really--
- He doesn't remember.

03:54.468 --> 03:56.770
- I think we just got drunk
and had sex--

03:56.804 --> 03:58.205
- Okay, Tom, can you make it
a little more roman--

03:58.306 --> 03:59.807
no, that--first of all,

03:59.840 --> 04:01.409
that didn't--it didn't
happen like that anyway.

04:01.442 --> 04:03.143
- Now you're gonna make
a deeper commitment.

04:03.176 --> 04:06.046
- She's always making me
commit to things.

04:06.079 --> 04:07.881
- Do you have an estimated
number of guests

04:07.915 --> 04:09.016
that are gonna be
attending your wedding?

04:09.049 --> 04:11.319
- We figure probably about 100,

04:11.352 --> 04:13.321
give or take,
will actually come.

04:13.321 --> 04:14.955
Yeah, I have--I have--
- I wanted to elope.

04:14.988 --> 04:17.425
So, like, less is more.

04:17.458 --> 04:19.893
I don't want a big wedding.

04:19.927 --> 04:22.195
- How many bridesmaids
are you planning on having?

04:22.229 --> 04:23.497
- Eight.
- You would probably just have

04:23.531 --> 04:25.333
to think about
how you're gonna pair everyone.

04:25.333 --> 04:26.567
- Make Jax walk with all
the girls

04:26.600 --> 04:28.402
he has slept with,
like, at once.

04:28.436 --> 04:30.871
- That would be half of
my bridal party.

04:30.904 --> 04:32.473
- And Jackson will probably
try to sleep with you,

04:32.506 --> 04:34.642
just to give you a heads up.
Just ignore him.

04:34.675 --> 04:37.811
- Oh, my God, stop.
- Okay.

04:37.845 --> 04:42.249
So do you have
any other questions, you think?

04:42.350 --> 04:46.186
- You know, where are we at in
terms of how much we've spent?

04:46.219 --> 04:47.721
- What's the damage?

04:47.755 --> 04:48.822
- With everything we
spoke about,

04:48.856 --> 04:50.358
I would probably say around,

04:50.358 --> 04:54.728
like, the $24,000--yeah,
right around there.

04:54.762 --> 04:56.263
All right.
So it was--

04:56.364 --> 04:59.367
- It's not all right.
It's not right, Trisha.

05:01.369 --> 05:06.674
*

05:06.707 --> 05:08.476
- * 'Cause you want,
'cause you want *

05:08.509 --> 05:10.043
* 'Cause you wanna be young

05:10.077 --> 05:12.179
* Raise your hands to the sky

05:12.212 --> 05:14.515
* Raise 'em up real high

05:16.384 --> 05:18.519
- Your butt looks good.
- Cool.

05:18.552 --> 05:19.887
- This is L.A.

05:19.920 --> 05:23.156
You're surrounded
by actors and models.

05:23.190 --> 05:25.926
So it puts a lot of pressure
on you to kind of make sure

05:25.959 --> 05:28.396
you're not
the worst in-shape dude here.

05:28.396 --> 05:31.765
So got to keep
that beach body on standby.

05:33.033 --> 05:34.602
Hey, what's up, dude?

05:34.635 --> 05:36.136
- Hell, yeah.
You're good at that thing.

05:36.169 --> 05:38.839
- Been doing it since I wrestled
in high school. Thanks, yeah.

05:38.872 --> 05:40.040
- Hi.
- Hey.

05:40.073 --> 05:42.042
- What's up?
I like your workout gear.

05:42.075 --> 05:44.612
- Thanks.
- Very professional.

05:44.645 --> 05:46.980
- Whoo! Feel the stretch.
- Yeah.

05:47.014 --> 05:49.517
- So what's up? How are you?
- Good, man.

05:49.550 --> 05:51.419
Are you in trouble
at all with Lisa and Ken?

05:51.419 --> 05:53.120
- Oh, yeah, I'm in trouble.
- Yeah?

05:53.153 --> 05:54.422
- Yeah.
- What happened?

05:54.455 --> 05:56.424
- I got fired.
- What?

05:56.424 --> 05:57.458
- What?

05:57.491 --> 05:59.693
- Yeah, I got fired
from Sur and Pump.

05:59.727 --> 06:02.229
- Why? Why did you get fired?
- Because, dude, just, like,

06:02.262 --> 06:03.631
you know,
I was drinking at Sur,

06:03.664 --> 06:05.098
and I shouted at Jax,
and I said "F---"

06:05.132 --> 06:06.800
in the restaurant
when I was talking to you.

06:07.501 --> 06:08.769
- Oh, my God.

06:08.802 --> 06:10.237
I can't deal with this
f---ing bullsh--.

06:10.270 --> 06:13.273
- See?
- What? What?

06:16.810 --> 06:18.311
- That's bullsh--, dude.
- I know.

06:18.345 --> 06:19.713
- This time is bullsh--.

06:19.747 --> 06:21.515
I mean, other times--yes,

06:21.549 --> 06:23.984
you've f---ed up other times.

06:24.017 --> 06:27.621
You know, if every time Jax
got me riled up, I lost my sh--

06:27.655 --> 06:31.592
and created a scene, like,
I wouldn't have a job either.

06:31.625 --> 06:35.929
So, wait, does Raquel know
about the GG sh--?

06:35.963 --> 06:37.865
- Yes, dude. I told her.

06:37.898 --> 06:39.099
I told her
that there's this girl

06:39.132 --> 06:41.368
claiming that
I hooked up with her at Sur.

06:41.469 --> 06:43.070
- In April--like,
the beginning of April,

06:43.103 --> 06:45.272
we hooked up.
- Wait.

06:45.305 --> 06:47.475
He's been dating a girl
since New Year's, I thought.

06:47.508 --> 06:48.976
- Yeah.
- Did you hook up with her?

06:49.009 --> 06:51.111
- No, I did not hook up
with f---ing GG.

06:51.144 --> 06:52.646
- Fair enough.
- They're just trying to f---

06:52.680 --> 06:54.147
with you.
- Let them keep f---ing with me.

06:54.181 --> 06:55.883
- Well, you lost
your job over it.

06:55.916 --> 06:58.285
- It's frustrating,
the fact that Jax and GG

06:58.318 --> 06:59.386
made up this f---ing rumor,

06:59.487 --> 07:00.954
which obviously isn't true,

07:00.988 --> 07:03.356
but what's even more frustrating
is the fact that, you know,

07:03.390 --> 07:04.825
I've got my mates
coming up to me

07:04.858 --> 07:06.660
and asking me if it's true.

07:06.694 --> 07:11.298
I have to go out of my way
to make sure that I'm innocent.

07:11.331 --> 07:13.601
I could sit in my room
on my tenth floor,

07:13.634 --> 07:15.836
looking over Beverly Hills,
and just sulk for days.

07:15.869 --> 07:17.170
I'm not gonna do that.

07:17.204 --> 07:18.739
- Sometimes a good jerk off
in the mirror

07:18.772 --> 07:20.007
is good after you get fired.

07:20.040 --> 07:21.775
- The shower's even better.

07:21.809 --> 07:24.144
- Ew. You're gross.

07:26.146 --> 07:31.051
*

07:31.084 --> 07:33.821
- How did everything
come out, ladies?

07:33.854 --> 07:35.556
- Good.
- Everything looks okay?

07:35.589 --> 07:37.357
All right.

07:37.390 --> 07:39.192
- Hey, Lala, everything good?
- Yes.

07:39.226 --> 07:41.261
- How many do you have?
- A lot.

07:41.294 --> 07:42.696
- That's good.
- Can I--do you mind

07:42.730 --> 07:44.264
if I talk to you outside
for just a sec?

07:44.297 --> 07:45.533
- Okay, but hurry,
'cause I'm leaving.

07:45.533 --> 07:47.668
- I'll hurry.
- Okay.

07:47.701 --> 07:50.871
- Ooh, new Rollies.

07:50.904 --> 07:52.706
- Yeah. So what is it?

07:52.740 --> 07:57.811
- Well, I spoke to Katie again,
all about these rumors.

07:57.845 --> 08:00.113
- Is this the one that
they think is married?

08:00.147 --> 08:01.381
- Well, apparently, yes.

08:01.414 --> 08:03.416
- Well, you would know.
- I would know,

08:03.450 --> 08:06.687
and he's definitely not married.

08:06.720 --> 08:09.022
- Are you sure, Lala?
- Yes.

08:09.056 --> 08:11.692
- You look like you're going
a little shade of pink to me.

08:11.725 --> 08:14.562
- I'm not dating a married
human being--absolutely not.

08:14.562 --> 08:19.399
I have a guy who definitely
spoils me rotten,

08:19.432 --> 08:23.303
but he's not the married guy
they're talking about.

08:23.336 --> 08:24.572
- I don't know if the rumors

08:24.572 --> 08:26.940
about Lala dating
a married man are true.

08:26.974 --> 08:29.777
I hope not.
It's not my business,

08:29.810 --> 08:32.913
but something seems
a little off to me.

08:32.946 --> 08:35.849
I mean, I guess the only time
it would be my business

08:35.883 --> 08:38.185
is if the married man
was my husband,

08:38.218 --> 08:39.953
and it's not, thankfully.

08:39.987 --> 08:42.590
You either turn around--you say,
"None of your damn business..."

08:42.590 --> 08:43.924
- Yeah.
- But if you're guilty

08:43.957 --> 08:45.225
of something,
then you better come clean.

08:45.258 --> 08:46.894
- No.
It was touching my nerve about

08:46.927 --> 08:50.297
where I was getting my car
and things like that.

08:50.330 --> 08:52.600
I respect the hell out of Lisa.

08:52.633 --> 08:54.768
So yeah, I'm blushing
and getting nervous.

08:54.802 --> 08:57.470
I mean, it's absolutely
mortifying when rumors

08:57.504 --> 09:00.373
like that are traveling
all the way up to your boss.

09:00.407 --> 09:02.242
- I have to go.
- Okay.

09:02.275 --> 09:03.611
- Yes.
- I'll come with you.

09:03.611 --> 09:04.878
We'll go get a cocktail.

09:04.912 --> 09:06.647
She's a mother figure to us,

09:06.680 --> 09:09.149
so she's not afraid
to call us out,

09:09.182 --> 09:11.819
but I wish she would
also trust me.

09:11.852 --> 09:14.655
- Go back to work.
- Okay, I'm working.

09:17.858 --> 09:20.260
- A month ago, me
and James hooked up.

09:20.293 --> 09:21.962
- A month ago?
- A month ago.

09:26.166 --> 09:26.533
[upbeat music]

09:29.136 --> 09:33.406
*

09:33.440 --> 09:35.242
- What's up, dude?
- What's up, man?

09:35.275 --> 09:37.077
- Got the wedding coming up.
- Oh, no way.

09:37.110 --> 09:39.980
- I'm trying to work
as much as possible.

09:40.013 --> 09:41.782
- What's up?
- Trying to make some skrill.

09:41.815 --> 09:43.216
How you been, man?

09:43.250 --> 09:45.518
- I'm good, dude.
- What are we doing?

09:45.552 --> 09:48.288
- Well, today we're doing
the matching

09:48.321 --> 09:52.159
underwear and socks for Related.

09:52.192 --> 09:53.393
- You're out of your mind.

09:53.426 --> 09:54.928
They are not--
- No?

09:54.962 --> 09:57.030
- I'm not doing that. I'm not
really an underwear model.

09:57.064 --> 09:58.699
I'm honestly
surprised they hired me,

09:58.732 --> 10:02.002
but I'm happy they did, because
I needed to make some cash fast.

10:02.035 --> 10:03.303
- Can you fix your nuts
and make 'em look bigger?

10:03.336 --> 10:04.571
- Yeah.
- Do you need me to stuff 'em?

10:04.604 --> 10:06.573
- No.
- Are you sure?

10:06.606 --> 10:08.909
So you know--I mean, because
we do two pairs of socks,

10:08.942 --> 10:10.377
you can actually use
the other pair of socks

10:10.410 --> 10:11.578
and put 'em where
they need to go.

10:11.611 --> 10:14.114
- Dude, come on.
He's just a little shy.

10:14.147 --> 10:17.851
It's a lot of compression,
and I'm just hanging in there.

10:17.885 --> 10:19.653
It's kind of smushable,
you know?

10:19.687 --> 10:22.355
- Have him put the ball
right above the waistband

10:22.389 --> 10:24.792
so you can see the RLTD
and hide his belly.

10:24.825 --> 10:26.860
- Okay. Go, and go.

10:26.894 --> 10:29.029
- Oh, sh--.

10:29.062 --> 10:31.431
- We need to fix this.
Just stuff that.

10:31.464 --> 10:35.168
Is this somebody's?
Can we use this peach?

10:35.202 --> 10:37.470
- I'm not--I'm not--
- Put the peach in, dude.

10:37.504 --> 10:39.873
- Shoot. Shoot.

10:39.907 --> 10:42.642
How's that moose knuckle?

10:42.676 --> 10:43.877
- I don't know why
it's bunching up so much.

10:43.911 --> 10:45.112
- I don't know
why that is, but--

10:45.145 --> 10:46.880
- When they tell me
to stuff my underwear,

10:46.914 --> 10:49.817
I'm not sure
if it's their way of saying,

10:49.850 --> 10:53.153
"Your package
isn't showing well."

10:53.186 --> 10:55.889
- You're good. You're great.
- These are dope, Tom.

10:55.923 --> 10:57.457
- I still like doing
modeling jobs,

10:57.490 --> 11:00.393
but I like to think I could be
more choosy about them,

11:00.427 --> 11:02.796
but, you know, wedding fast
approaching--

11:02.830 --> 11:04.531
I can't really be
as choosy as I want to be.

11:04.564 --> 11:06.566
- This thing came out amazing.
I really liked it.

11:06.599 --> 11:07.835
It was awesome.
- Was that sarcasm?

11:07.868 --> 11:09.502
- No, man,
and that'll definitely

11:09.536 --> 11:10.738
get you going
for some other stuff,

11:10.738 --> 11:11.805
'cause it worked out perfectly.

11:11.839 --> 11:12.973
- Cool. All right.
- So--

11:13.006 --> 11:14.441
- Well, if you're happy,
then I'm happy.

11:14.474 --> 11:16.309
- That's a wrap.
- That's a wrap.

11:18.611 --> 11:25.385
*

11:25.418 --> 11:26.486
- All right. You enjoy.

11:26.519 --> 11:27.821
Let me know
if you need anything else.

11:30.223 --> 11:31.624
Are we all doing okay
with drinks

11:31.658 --> 11:34.627
and everything at the moment?
It's good?

11:34.661 --> 11:36.196
- It's kind of busy everywhere.
- Well, yeah, I mean--

11:36.229 --> 11:37.798
- I'm, like, running
from post to post.

11:37.831 --> 11:40.367
- We're short a bartender 'cause
Jax is, like, over an hour late.

11:40.400 --> 11:43.303
- Is he an hour late?
- Mm-hmm.

11:43.336 --> 11:44.637
- He's supposed to be
on at 7:00?

11:44.671 --> 11:46.073
- Yeah.
- Has anybody heard from him?

11:46.106 --> 11:48.275
Brooke, have you heard from Jax?

11:48.308 --> 11:49.676
- I haven't seen him.
- You know what?

11:49.777 --> 11:52.780
When you see him, write him up,
just, like, bam.

11:59.820 --> 12:01.354
- Excuse me.
- And then I did overhear

12:01.388 --> 12:03.356
a little, like--
- What the hell?

12:03.390 --> 12:04.792
Why are you an hour late?

12:04.825 --> 12:06.293
You can't just walk
in here an hour late.

12:06.326 --> 12:08.128
They've been under stress.
- I understand.

12:08.161 --> 12:09.496
I got locked out of my place.
I was at the beach.

12:09.529 --> 12:11.198
- I don't care what it is.
- Brittany took my keys.

12:11.231 --> 12:12.432
I got locked out.

12:12.465 --> 12:14.601
- Oh, really, Jax?
So you were locked out?

12:14.634 --> 12:16.703
Last time, it was
you were locked up.

12:16.804 --> 12:18.605
Where have you been, actually?

12:18.638 --> 12:20.473
- Where have you been?
- I was in jail.

12:20.507 --> 12:23.110
- Good excuse--that's actually
your best one yet.

12:23.143 --> 12:24.344
If it's not knocked out,

12:24.377 --> 12:27.314
what's gonna be the next one,
knocked up?

12:27.347 --> 12:29.082
All I know is you're supposed
to be here at 7:00...

12:29.116 --> 12:30.617
- You're right. You're right.
- And you are now here at 8:20.

12:30.650 --> 12:32.820
- Yes. You're right.
- So you need to apologize

12:32.853 --> 12:34.654
to all the other people that
have been picking up your slack.

12:34.687 --> 12:37.825
- I'm sorry for being late.
I'm sorry for being late.

12:37.825 --> 12:39.192
- Don't be cheeky.

12:39.226 --> 12:41.728
Have you washed your hands?
Are you ready to start work?

12:41.829 --> 12:44.231
You have? Well, go on, then.
- Let me catch up a little bit.

12:44.264 --> 12:45.465
Go ahead. I'm sorry.
I'll get out of your way.

12:45.498 --> 12:47.500
- Yeah.
- Am I in your way?

12:47.534 --> 12:49.502
- Don't give him his share
of the tips.

12:49.536 --> 12:52.072
Hit him where it hurts.

12:52.105 --> 12:55.575
* - Yeah, we go,
yeah, we go out *

12:55.608 --> 12:57.110
* We go, yeah, we go out

12:57.144 --> 12:59.847
* We go, yeah, we go out,
whoa-oh, whoa-oh *

12:59.847 --> 13:01.949
- It's the first time
for this, right?

13:01.982 --> 13:04.852
- Not the first time
riding a new bike.

13:07.454 --> 13:09.589
Don't kill me before I get
to eat some enchiladas, okay?

13:09.622 --> 13:11.158
- Okay.
- All right.

13:11.191 --> 13:13.894
Cool.

13:13.927 --> 13:15.528
- How's it going?
- How's it going?

13:15.562 --> 13:17.364
Do you need valet parking,
mister?

13:17.397 --> 13:18.398
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Okay.

13:18.431 --> 13:20.300
- Can you do a little valet?
- Yes.

13:20.333 --> 13:21.935
- All right.
- Thank you.

13:21.969 --> 13:24.371
It's so awesome.

13:26.974 --> 13:29.609
- Ariana's brother
is staying with us now.

13:29.642 --> 13:30.610
- Morning.

13:30.643 --> 13:32.379
- Hey.
- What's up, man?

13:32.412 --> 13:36.216
- And definitely doesn't help
me and Ariana's relationship.

13:36.249 --> 13:37.384
- Welcome to Red O.
My name is Samuel.

13:37.417 --> 13:38.886
I'll be taking care
of you tonight.

13:38.919 --> 13:42.789
- I think it's really important
to have our private time.

13:42.890 --> 13:45.092
- Do you want
to get some ceviche?

13:45.125 --> 13:47.694
- Yeah.
- Cool, cool, cool.

13:47.727 --> 13:50.397
This date's going really well.

13:50.430 --> 13:52.699
Thank you.
- All right. Thank you.

13:52.732 --> 13:55.402
So I wonder how Schwartz
and Katie are doing.

13:55.435 --> 13:57.004
I know they got into it
the other day.

13:57.037 --> 13:59.206
- What about?
- I don't even remember,

13:59.239 --> 14:02.242
and I don't even think,
in the moment, they remember.

14:02.275 --> 14:04.111
A lot of times,
Schwartz gets, like,

14:04.144 --> 14:07.280
a little hint of Katie possibly,
like, going there...

14:07.314 --> 14:09.316
- Exactly.
- And then she goes there.

14:09.349 --> 14:11.218
- And then it's like--
- She starts nasty things

14:11.251 --> 14:12.419
and whatever, and, like, goes--

14:12.452 --> 14:13.921
- It's like
a self-fulfilling prophecy.

14:13.954 --> 14:15.422
- Exactly.

14:15.455 --> 14:17.190
I feel like we're pretty good
at that stuff.

14:17.224 --> 14:18.725
Dodging that sh--.
- Yeah.

14:18.758 --> 14:20.093
- I mean, we definitely have

14:20.127 --> 14:22.229
our moments,
at times, but, dude--

14:22.262 --> 14:23.931
- It's not like we agree
on everything.

14:23.931 --> 14:25.632
I don't want to agree
with you on everything.

14:25.665 --> 14:27.935
- Exactly. I don't either.
That's boring.

14:27.935 --> 14:29.736
- As long as you agree
on the important stuff...

14:29.769 --> 14:31.404
- Mm-hmm.

14:31.438 --> 14:35.308
- Like kids, marriage.

14:36.409 --> 14:37.945
- It's funny to me

14:37.945 --> 14:41.181
that you would be willing
to buy a house with me

14:41.214 --> 14:43.050
and get into a 30-year loan,

14:43.083 --> 14:45.953
which is basically, to me,

14:45.953 --> 14:49.422
way more of a commitment
than marriage.

14:49.456 --> 14:52.125
- Tom and I are still living
in the same apartment.

14:52.159 --> 14:54.627
He's been there for 12 years.

14:54.661 --> 14:56.329
If you're gonna use
the microwave,

14:56.363 --> 14:58.531
you have to make sure

14:58.565 --> 15:01.301
that you're not running the AC
at the same time.

15:01.334 --> 15:03.070
- I know. Is it on high or low?
- High.

15:03.103 --> 15:06.139
- It is?

15:06.173 --> 15:07.540
- This dumb AC--

15:07.574 --> 15:09.977
- I know, man.
- When we move into our house,

15:09.977 --> 15:11.444
can we have central air, please?

15:11.478 --> 15:13.180
- No. I like window units.

15:13.213 --> 15:15.682
- Tom and I are
totally meant to be together.

15:15.715 --> 15:17.350
We do want to buy
a house one day,

15:17.384 --> 15:21.754
but I have personally
never wanted to get married.

15:21.788 --> 15:23.723
I just don't see the point.

15:23.756 --> 15:26.493
I think it's surrendering
to this, like,

15:26.526 --> 15:30.330
societal thing
you're supposed to do.

15:30.363 --> 15:32.032
I don't like that.
We're married.

15:32.065 --> 15:34.667
Whoo. There we go.
We just did it.

15:34.701 --> 15:36.269
- Look, even though
Ariana likes to say

15:36.303 --> 15:39.006
that she doesn't want
to ever get married,

15:39.006 --> 15:41.074
I know that if she were
to ever get married,

15:41.108 --> 15:44.344
I would be that guy,
and vice versa.

15:44.377 --> 15:47.447
I want that whole thing
in your mouth.

15:47.480 --> 15:49.249
[laughs]

15:49.282 --> 15:50.883
Yes.

15:50.917 --> 15:53.753
Married or not, we all know
that she's the one for me.

15:53.786 --> 15:57.790
Oh, my God.
That was f---ing sexy as hell.

15:57.824 --> 16:01.028
- Mm.
- I love you.

16:01.028 --> 16:02.462
- I can't reach you
and kiss you,

16:02.495 --> 16:04.264
but I'm thinking about it.

16:04.297 --> 16:05.665
- I am too.

16:11.938 --> 16:14.041
- It's hot.
- Did you put sun block on?

16:14.041 --> 16:15.575
- I'm allergic to sun block.
- Oh, wow.

16:15.608 --> 16:17.277
- You're allergic?
- Yeah. The sun block--

16:17.310 --> 16:20.180
the only sun block
I can use is, like, $400 a tube.

16:20.213 --> 16:21.481
- Oh, my God.

16:21.514 --> 16:22.815
- This is gonna be
a little tough today.

16:22.849 --> 16:24.251
Tiffany and Ellie,

16:24.284 --> 16:26.486
we have been great friends
since I moved out here.

16:26.519 --> 16:28.288
They've worked at Villa Blanca.

16:28.321 --> 16:29.722
They've worked at Pump.

16:29.756 --> 16:31.058
They've worked at Sur.

16:31.058 --> 16:33.426
- Two steps at a time.
- Two at a time?

16:33.460 --> 16:35.928
- Squeeze your abs.
Squeeze your booty.

16:35.962 --> 16:37.064
- At one point,

16:37.097 --> 16:39.299
Ellie has been friends
with Kristen,

16:39.332 --> 16:40.700
Stassi, Scheana,

16:40.733 --> 16:42.669
all of these unmuzzled bitches,

16:42.702 --> 16:44.871
and she's still cool with me.

16:44.904 --> 16:46.373
Do you guys
have to work tonight?

16:46.406 --> 16:47.540
- Yeah, I do.

16:47.574 --> 16:49.376
- Those two are,
like, my sisters.

16:49.409 --> 16:51.478
I would tell them anything
and everything,

16:51.511 --> 16:54.681
and honesty is a big thing
when it comes to friendships.

16:54.714 --> 16:56.249
- How are you getting along
with the girls?

16:56.283 --> 16:58.318
- I don't feel like I had done
anything to any of them,

16:58.351 --> 17:01.721
and then they hit me in a spot
where I didn't like,

17:01.754 --> 17:04.357
and they started going in on,
like, my relationship.

17:04.391 --> 17:06.759
"If you can't be honest
about where you got your shoes,

17:06.793 --> 17:08.295
how could I trust you
with a friendship?" I'm like--

17:08.328 --> 17:10.097
- Who cares?
- Oh, my God.

17:10.097 --> 17:11.364
- I know. I was like,

17:11.398 --> 17:13.900
"Brittany got boobs
from the man she loves."

17:13.933 --> 17:15.135
- Yeah, exactly.

17:15.168 --> 17:16.203
- I happen to get
shoes from the man that I love.

17:16.236 --> 17:17.504
I went, "Why do you care?"

17:17.537 --> 17:18.438
- Yeah. What's wrong
with that?

17:18.471 --> 17:19.672
- Jax said to me the other day,

17:19.706 --> 17:21.708
"Go suck dick for a Range
Rover," and I was like,

17:21.741 --> 17:25.612
"I'm sucking dick for more
than just a Range Rover, honey."

17:25.645 --> 17:27.447
- I would do it.
Why not, right?

17:27.480 --> 17:29.716
We would do it.
I would do it. Hey.

17:29.749 --> 17:31.484
- You guys are my friends.

17:31.518 --> 17:32.985
I'm obviously going to tell you

17:33.019 --> 17:35.322
about who I'm dating
and what we're doing.

17:35.355 --> 17:37.390
I am
in a committed relationship,

17:37.424 --> 17:40.660
and, yes, he likes to reward me
because I give good dome.

17:40.693 --> 17:43.130
James DJs at Pump tonight,
doesn't he, or Sur?

17:43.130 --> 17:46.699
- No. Lisa told me
yesterday she fired him.

17:46.733 --> 17:47.700
- What?

17:47.734 --> 17:49.536
- Wait, James got fired
from Pump?

17:49.569 --> 17:52.172
- James got fired
from Pump and Sur.

17:53.773 --> 17:55.142
- You don't know what happened?

17:55.142 --> 17:57.877
- Lisa said he'd just been
getting drunk a lot,

17:57.910 --> 18:01.348
so she's like, "I can't--I can't
do this anymore."

18:01.381 --> 18:03.250
- This is really bad.

18:03.283 --> 18:07.354
James was the one friend
that I had at work.

18:07.387 --> 18:09.756
Who is going to have
my back now?

18:09.789 --> 18:12.159
Who's gonna sneak me drinks
while I'm working?

18:12.159 --> 18:14.861
Work is about
to get a lot tougher.

18:14.894 --> 18:16.296
Well, the other night at Sur,

18:16.329 --> 18:19.866
he and the new hostess GG were,
like, screaming at each other.

18:19.899 --> 18:21.834
- You're being unacceptable
and very rude.

18:21.868 --> 18:24.471
- You're always drunk.
You have no talent.

18:24.504 --> 18:27.207
- Why--that's not what you said
when you come to Pump

18:27.240 --> 18:29.209
every f---ing time.

18:29.242 --> 18:30.710
- Why were they screaming
at each other?

18:30.743 --> 18:33.246
- Because GG hooked up
with James

18:33.280 --> 18:34.847
while he was still
with his girlfriend.

18:34.881 --> 18:36.983
- GG's saying that she slept
with James?

18:37.016 --> 18:38.185
- Yeah.

18:38.185 --> 18:39.686
- And doesn't
he have a girlfriend?

18:39.719 --> 18:40.753
- He does have a girlfriend.
- I guess that doesn't stop him.

18:40.787 --> 18:42.822
Ellie knows about that.

18:42.855 --> 18:45.492
- What do you mean, Ellie knows?
- Babe, you know, like,

18:45.525 --> 18:47.260
me and James had
something going on.

18:47.294 --> 18:50.697
- I didn't know about this.
- A month ago, we hooked up.

18:50.730 --> 18:52.399
- A month ago?
- A month ago.

18:52.432 --> 18:53.800
- A month ago?
- I know, and he denies it--

18:53.833 --> 18:55.368
and he denies--
- Because a few days ago,

18:55.402 --> 18:58.938
they just celebrated
their six-month anniversary.

18:58.971 --> 19:00.307
- Well, I can prove you.

19:00.340 --> 19:02.008
We woke up next to each other.

19:02.041 --> 19:03.776
I'm gonna pull up the picture
because I don't want

19:03.810 --> 19:05.478
Lala to think I'm crazy.

19:05.512 --> 19:08.648
Here--us in bed.

19:08.681 --> 19:10.683
- Oh, my gosh.
You guys, what is he doing?

19:10.717 --> 19:13.953
- She took the picture
because she knew--

19:13.986 --> 19:17.056
- James has told me
multiple times

19:17.089 --> 19:19.459
that he has never
cheated on Raquel.

19:19.492 --> 19:22.462
I have heard that you've been
hooking up with GG.

19:22.495 --> 19:24.797
- I have not hooked up with GG.
Who said that?

19:24.831 --> 19:27.334
- But there's the picture
with James

19:27.367 --> 19:28.735
in the bed with Ellie

19:28.768 --> 19:32.239
with a date that clearly states
when it happened.

19:32.272 --> 19:33.640
Holy sh--.

19:33.673 --> 19:34.974
- You can't trust him.
- You're like the CIA.

19:35.007 --> 19:36.509
Good Lord.
- Only because he said,

19:36.543 --> 19:38.878
"I'm gonna make you look bad.
You're crazy."

19:38.911 --> 19:41.248
He tells me,
"We're just f---ing, Ellie.

19:41.248 --> 19:42.815
It's nothing.
I have a girlfriend."

19:42.849 --> 19:44.384
- That's shocking to me.

19:44.417 --> 19:46.519
Ellie, since I'm going
over there...

19:46.553 --> 19:47.620
- Mm-hmm.

19:47.654 --> 19:48.488
- I'll obviously want
to ask him.

19:48.521 --> 19:49.589
Don't just send just the photo.

19:49.622 --> 19:51.324
Screenshot it so that date
is up there.

19:51.358 --> 19:53.326
- Yeah, I just did that.
- You did it? You sent it to me?

19:53.360 --> 19:55.027
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.
- It's not about coming at him

19:55.061 --> 19:56.663
and saying, "I caught you."

19:56.696 --> 19:58.765
I just don't want him
to be blindsided

19:58.798 --> 20:03.270
if someone else shows him
that this exists.

20:03.303 --> 20:05.405
- Should we get going?
- Lily's probably dying.

20:05.438 --> 20:06.939
- Come on, my love.

20:06.973 --> 20:09.476
- Cool, Tom.
Do you want to insult me more?

20:09.509 --> 20:11.010
Talk about how your dick
doesn't work, either.

20:17.617 --> 20:17.984
[upbeat music]

20:21.788 --> 20:25.358
- * We'll go to places
we never been *

20:25.392 --> 20:29.362
* Don't ask why

20:29.396 --> 20:33.800
* 'Cause we ain't got time

20:33.833 --> 20:35.635
- It's not a big deal.
- Hey.

20:35.668 --> 20:37.069
- Hey, what's up? Hey.

20:37.103 --> 20:39.539
- Hey.
- Hi.

20:39.572 --> 20:41.441
Congratulations. I hear you're
a groomsman--groomswoman.

20:41.474 --> 20:43.209
- Thank you, thank you,
thank you.

20:43.242 --> 20:45.044
- I want you to officially
be a groomsman.

20:45.077 --> 20:48.748
- Oh, that's so cool.
- Congratulations.

20:48.781 --> 20:49.882
- I'm starting to feel like

20:49.916 --> 20:51.551
we're on that bus
from "Speed," you know?

20:51.584 --> 20:54.421
Like, "If this wedding
doesn't happen by August 17th,

20:54.454 --> 20:56.055
we're all dead."

21:02.194 --> 21:03.162
- Hi.
- What's up, guys?

21:03.195 --> 21:04.497
We're talking man stuff
over here,

21:04.531 --> 21:06.633
but since you're a groomsman,
I guess--

21:06.666 --> 21:08.601
- Man stuff.
- Yeah, she is a groomsman. So--

21:08.635 --> 21:10.370
- Fart--talk about farts.
Talk about--

21:10.403 --> 21:13.840
- We're talking about pussy.

21:13.873 --> 21:17.209
- What happened the other day
between you and James?

21:17.243 --> 21:19.879
- So there is a new host at Sur.
- [inaudible]

21:19.912 --> 21:21.047
- Yeah, I know.
- GG.

21:21.080 --> 21:22.982
- Jax, you do not give a f---
about that girl.

21:23.015 --> 21:24.351
- But it gives me an
in to, like--

21:24.351 --> 21:25.385
- He wants to prod James.

21:25.418 --> 21:26.653
- It gives me an in
to poke James.

21:26.686 --> 21:28.355
- I know.
- I know.

21:28.388 --> 21:29.956
- That's what it's really about.
- That's exactly what it--

21:29.989 --> 21:31.458
- That's true.
You do poke him a little much.

21:31.491 --> 21:32.992
Even though I don't like the
guy, you prod him a little much.

21:33.025 --> 21:34.527
- He didn't instigate that sh--
with you. You did.

21:34.561 --> 21:35.795
- Yes, he did.
He comes up and starts swearing,

21:35.828 --> 21:37.664
"Jax, make some f---ing
cocktails, bitch."

21:37.697 --> 21:39.699
- No. You provoked it.
- You can't go a day

21:39.732 --> 21:41.067
without getting your ass kicked.

21:41.100 --> 21:42.569
- 'Cause I'm a rock star
and you're a bartender.

21:42.602 --> 21:45.104
- A rock star--anybody can push
"play" on a laptop, you idiot.

21:45.137 --> 21:46.839
I provoked it?

21:46.873 --> 21:49.776
- Jax picks fights,
you know, stirs sh-- up,

21:49.809 --> 21:51.744
and the fact that James let it
get to him--

21:51.778 --> 21:53.480
I feel bad for the guy.

21:53.513 --> 21:54.914
Now he doesn't have a job.

21:54.947 --> 21:55.982
- He talks sh-- about you.

21:56.015 --> 21:57.216
- Just let me finish.
Let me finish.

21:57.249 --> 21:58.385
- I'm sorry. Did you not?

21:58.418 --> 21:59.652
- Let me finish.
- I'm supposed to sit here

21:59.686 --> 22:01.087
and talk about f---ing James?

22:01.120 --> 22:03.923
- Shut up for a second
and let me finish.

22:03.956 --> 22:04.891
- I don't want to hear it.

22:04.924 --> 22:07.927
- He got fired.
- Whoa. Holy sh--.

22:10.597 --> 22:12.399
- Oh, my God, yes.

22:12.399 --> 22:15.502
It just proves that
there is a god and he loves us.

22:17.770 --> 22:19.772
God, I'm so happy.
I'll cheers to it.

22:19.806 --> 22:20.773
I'll cheers this guy.

22:20.807 --> 22:22.409
- Don't celebrate it, Jax.

22:22.409 --> 22:23.776
Like, the guy
literally has nothing.

22:23.810 --> 22:25.612
- He deserves it. Go get a job.

22:25.645 --> 22:27.013
Stop drinking,
and do your thing.

22:27.046 --> 22:28.681
- I say--I say,
even though I hate him--

22:28.715 --> 22:30.483
- Yo, I'm in the mix, yo.

22:30.517 --> 22:33.653
It's DJ James,
f-f-f-f-f--- face.

22:33.686 --> 22:35.187
I have nowhere to play anymore.
Whoa, wait a minute.

22:35.221 --> 22:37.724
Yes, I do. I'm playing
at your local Applebee's.

22:37.757 --> 22:39.191
Come and check me out.

22:39.225 --> 22:42.562
DJ J-J-J-James.
DJ F--- Face.

22:42.595 --> 22:44.797
- Does anyone know
what they're yelling about?

22:44.831 --> 22:45.965
- No.
- [inaudible]

22:45.998 --> 22:49.602
I don't have a drink.

22:49.636 --> 22:51.137
Hi.
- How--wait.

22:51.170 --> 22:52.939
- What's happening?
- What the f---?

22:52.972 --> 22:54.273
What is going on over there?

22:54.306 --> 22:55.508
- Apparently, James got fired
from both places.

22:55.542 --> 22:56.509
- Oh, really?

22:56.543 --> 22:57.510
- Wait, what?
- What?

22:57.544 --> 22:58.811
- Finally?
- Yeah.

22:58.845 --> 23:01.047
- Stop it. No way.
There's no f---ing way.

23:01.080 --> 23:03.315
- According to him,
he said he got fired. So--

23:03.349 --> 23:05.251
- Be off, mother----er.
- Yeah.

23:05.284 --> 23:07.720
- Be off. Hell, yeah.

23:07.754 --> 23:09.255
F--- yes.

23:09.288 --> 23:10.523
Bye, bitch. Later.

23:10.557 --> 23:12.825
See ya. Sayonara.

23:15.361 --> 23:16.696
- But that wasn't the problem.

23:16.729 --> 23:18.965
The problem was--is, like,
Ariana and Tom, like, defending.

23:18.998 --> 23:21.768
It's sort of like,
"Well, did you provoke it?"

23:21.801 --> 23:24.070
No. You're swearing
in a f---ing restaurant.

23:24.103 --> 23:25.071
- Yeah.
- Why?

23:25.104 --> 23:26.473
Why are they defending him? Why?

23:26.473 --> 23:29.375
What world am I living in that
Tom and Ariana are like,

23:29.476 --> 23:31.043
"No, Jax.
Like, you provoked him.

23:31.077 --> 23:32.479
It's all your fault
he got fired."

23:32.479 --> 23:34.280
Like, maybe it's James's fault
he got fired.

23:34.313 --> 23:35.648
I don't know.

23:35.682 --> 23:38.117
- Kristen, Stassi,
and Katie seem to have a problem

23:38.150 --> 23:39.519
with my expressions.

23:39.552 --> 23:41.120
I don't know if I just
have too much Botox,

23:41.153 --> 23:43.990
but they say I--like, I smile
and I don't look, like, nice.

23:44.023 --> 23:45.992
I look, like, bitchy.

23:46.025 --> 23:47.660
[laughter]

23:47.694 --> 23:49.629
I guess I just need to work
on my happy face.

23:49.662 --> 23:52.532
- Or unhinge your jaw.
- Show my veneers.

23:52.565 --> 23:56.135
Speaking of veneers--
your temps look good.

23:56.168 --> 23:59.506
- It's really uncomfortable.
- Doesn't look any different,

23:59.506 --> 24:01.841
which is good--which is good.

24:01.874 --> 24:03.943
- Just stop while you're ahead.

24:03.976 --> 24:05.712
I know that you and Tom

24:05.745 --> 24:07.614
are, like, definitely not
my number one fan.

24:07.647 --> 24:09.616
I know you guys don't
like me, but seriously...

24:09.649 --> 24:11.017
What the f---?

24:11.050 --> 24:13.252
I don't get why
anyone defends James.

24:13.285 --> 24:14.621
I don't. I don't.

24:14.654 --> 24:16.322
Not only for what he's done
to me--the way

24:16.355 --> 24:18.324
he's treated her,
the way he's treated Katie--

24:18.357 --> 24:20.593
- First, like, I could say
the same thing about,

24:20.627 --> 24:22.261
like, you, for example.

24:22.294 --> 24:23.963
You've treated her like sh--.

24:23.996 --> 24:26.232
- You can't compare me
to James Kennedy. James--

24:26.265 --> 24:28.400
- I mean, you've punched
James in the face.

24:28.434 --> 24:29.902
- James, get the f---
out of my face.

24:29.936 --> 24:31.237
- Ow!

24:31.270 --> 24:33.272
- You've punched Schwartz.
- Schwartz, stop it.

24:33.305 --> 24:35.374
Who the f--- are you?

24:35.407 --> 24:37.076
[indistinct screaming]

24:37.109 --> 24:38.377
- Break it up!

24:38.410 --> 24:39.579
- You can't say that.
- Yeah, you punched Tom.

24:39.612 --> 24:41.180
[indistinct screaming]

24:41.213 --> 24:42.715
- Ahh!
- You can't say that.

24:42.749 --> 24:44.083
That's not fair.

24:44.116 --> 24:45.151
- But you have, though.

24:45.184 --> 24:47.153
- He literally is
the worst person.

24:47.186 --> 24:49.756
- I know that you believe that.

24:49.789 --> 24:51.758
If these kind of conversations

24:51.791 --> 24:54.260
are what it means
to be a bridesmaid,

24:54.293 --> 24:56.863
I am glad that I am a groomsman.

24:56.896 --> 24:58.364
I'll be in the same room
with you,

24:58.397 --> 25:03.035
who I've personally witnessed
physically assault other people.

25:03.069 --> 25:04.270
- If James Kennedy
walked in here,

25:04.303 --> 25:06.939
I'd physically
assault him hardcore.

25:12.211 --> 25:16.482
- * You always talk, talk,
baby *

25:16.583 --> 25:19.451
* Feed me lies and sway me

25:19.485 --> 25:20.653
- Enjoy.

25:20.687 --> 25:24.190
- * You always talk, talk,
baby *

25:24.223 --> 25:27.193
* Feed me lies and sway me

25:27.226 --> 25:28.227
- Hey. How's everybody?

25:28.260 --> 25:29.495
- Hi.
- Hey.

25:29.596 --> 25:30.763
- What's that big
old box you've got?

25:30.797 --> 25:32.198
- It's shirts for the waiters.

25:32.231 --> 25:34.166
- When are we getting
new dresses?

25:34.200 --> 25:37.003
- These are the new service
shirts for the summer.

25:37.036 --> 25:38.237
They're great.

25:38.270 --> 25:40.472
Sur's always a work
in progress.

25:40.506 --> 25:44.744
We change the color of the walls
or give the staff new outfits.

25:44.777 --> 25:45.978
There we are.

25:46.012 --> 25:47.246
I've learned,
as a restaurateur

25:47.279 --> 25:48.681
and a businesswoman,

25:48.715 --> 25:51.651
even if it isn't broke,
you've still got to fix it.

25:51.684 --> 25:53.753
- So can I wear that
instead of this?

25:53.786 --> 25:55.655
- Will you stop whining?

25:55.688 --> 25:57.624
- Hey, [inaudible],
have you stopped working out?

25:57.657 --> 25:59.191
- I think so.

25:59.225 --> 26:01.227
- Oh, my goodness.
- That's harassment.

26:01.260 --> 26:03.863
Leave him alone.
- That's so much cuter.

26:03.896 --> 26:06.198
Just saying--it's sexy
and unique.

26:06.232 --> 26:09.669
- Okay, stop messing about.
Listen, I'm going back to work.

26:09.702 --> 26:11.070
- All right.

26:11.103 --> 26:13.740
- Do you want your wine?
- No, no, I'm fine. Okay.

26:13.773 --> 26:15.675
You two, two minutes--
and then go back

26:15.708 --> 26:17.176
to doing what
you're supposed to be doing.

26:17.209 --> 26:18.344
- Yeah.
- Okay.

26:18.377 --> 26:20.012
- I get a two-minute break.
- Two minutes.

26:20.046 --> 26:22.815
- Yes, darling?

26:22.849 --> 26:27.053
- So I found out earlier

26:27.086 --> 26:29.221
that Ellie--apparently,

26:29.255 --> 26:33.726
she was showing Lala photos
that she took of James, like--

26:33.760 --> 26:36.462
when he was sleeping
in his apartment

26:36.495 --> 26:38.464
to try to prove to people

26:38.497 --> 26:41.901
that the two of them
have hooked up recently.

26:41.934 --> 26:43.870
- What?
- Ellie's like, "You know

26:43.903 --> 26:45.772
that I slept with James
a month ago," and she, like--

26:45.805 --> 26:47.674
- A month ago?
- A month ago.

26:47.707 --> 26:49.075
And then she's just, like,

26:49.108 --> 26:50.743
pulling up pictures
that she had taken in bed

26:50.777 --> 26:52.879
with him with the date.

26:52.912 --> 26:54.747
- Oh, I didn't hear about this.
I didn't know they had sex.

26:54.781 --> 26:56.215
- I knew they did, like,
a while back.

26:56.248 --> 26:57.950
- See, I didn't know that.
- I knew they did before

26:57.984 --> 26:59.351
him and Raquel started dating.

26:59.385 --> 27:00.920
- Yeah. Okay, I had no idea.

27:00.953 --> 27:03.756
I mean, I thought Ellie
had higher standards than that,

27:03.790 --> 27:07.694
but, I mean,
James--that's just a new low.

27:07.727 --> 27:09.361
- Aren't you supposed to, like,
hang out with her tomorrow

27:09.395 --> 27:10.596
or something?

27:10.697 --> 27:12.498
- I mean, she texted me to,
like, get coffee.

27:12.531 --> 27:15.868
- To talk about James?
- F---ing probably--

27:15.902 --> 27:18.871
Also, like,
she's older than Kristen.

27:18.905 --> 27:20.707
I mean, there's even
more of an age gap there.

27:20.740 --> 27:23.710
- How old is she, 34?
- What are these, like,

27:23.743 --> 27:26.145
mid-30-year-old women doing

27:26.178 --> 27:28.715
with a f---ing douchebag
24-year-old DJ?

27:28.715 --> 27:30.817
- I don't know.
I don't get it either.

27:32.418 --> 27:34.887
- So where do you
stand with Lala?

27:34.921 --> 27:36.322
- I love Lala.

27:44.330 --> 27:45.131
- * People,
it's taking forever *

27:47.834 --> 27:50.436
* I've tried to connect
with her *

27:50.469 --> 27:52.905
* But now she's gone

27:52.939 --> 27:56.108
- Can I get the goat cheese
salad with no beets?

27:56.142 --> 27:59.078
Thank you.

27:59.111 --> 28:00.747
Hi.

28:00.780 --> 28:03.215
- How are you?
- Good. How are you doing?

28:03.249 --> 28:06.185
- Good.

28:06.218 --> 28:07.653
- Okay, so--

28:07.754 --> 28:10.757
- Oh, God.
- James?

28:11.891 --> 28:13.760
- What?
- I wouldn't brag about it

28:13.760 --> 28:15.227
if I was dating him
either, but--

28:15.261 --> 28:17.329
- Well, first of all,
I didn't tell anyone

28:17.363 --> 28:18.798
because I was so ashamed.

28:18.831 --> 28:20.933
- I feel you on that.

28:20.967 --> 28:22.168
I wouldn't tell anybody.

28:22.201 --> 28:23.770
- So he said he was
dating someone,

28:23.770 --> 28:24.971
but
I thought it was just a joke.

28:25.004 --> 28:26.638
- Well, yeah,
'cause who would date him?

28:26.672 --> 28:29.341
- Yeah, I thought--

28:29.375 --> 28:30.843
- No offense.

28:32.244 --> 28:35.147
- Hey, we're all allowed
to make mistakes, okay?

28:35.181 --> 28:36.949
- One time.

28:36.983 --> 28:41.520
- Well, anyway, so I did--yeah,
I did sleep with him in March,

28:41.553 --> 28:43.856
and while we were in sex,
he said,

28:43.890 --> 28:46.225
"Just so you know, you don't
mean anything to me anymore."

28:46.258 --> 28:48.327
- During sex?
- Yeah.

28:48.360 --> 28:50.696
- So he's, like, literally,
like, having sex with you,

28:50.797 --> 28:52.031
saying, like,
"This means nothing.

28:52.064 --> 28:53.933
This means nothing."
- In the morning, I woke up.

28:53.966 --> 28:56.168
I'm like, "Wow," and I'm like,

28:56.202 --> 28:57.569
"I need to cover myself,
you know?"

28:57.603 --> 28:58.604
- What?
- Oh, my God.

28:58.637 --> 29:00.072
He's gonna make a move.

29:00.106 --> 29:01.974
He's gonna deny this.
I'm like--I was like,

29:02.008 --> 29:04.310
"I'm just gonna take a picture,
just in case."

29:04.343 --> 29:06.712
- Can I see the photo?
I'm really curious, actually.

29:06.813 --> 29:11.683
- March, 8:44 a.m.
- Yeah.

29:11.717 --> 29:13.119
Yeah, it is a little weird

29:13.152 --> 29:15.254
that Ellie took a selfie
in bed with James,

29:15.287 --> 29:17.156
but I kind of see
where she's coming from.

29:17.189 --> 29:19.826
It's like, "You want to call me
a liar? Here's proof I'm not."

29:19.826 --> 29:21.828
- He called me so many names
that I'm like...

29:21.861 --> 29:23.830
- That's--he's good at that.
- "Mother----er,

29:23.830 --> 29:26.232
I'm gonna get you,
just in case."

29:26.265 --> 29:27.566
The reason I told Lala

29:27.599 --> 29:29.836
and I'm telling you now,
I just want to come clean.

29:29.869 --> 29:33.605
- Yeah. So where do you stand
with, like, everyone now?

29:33.639 --> 29:34.874
James, Lala--

29:34.907 --> 29:39.478
- I love Lala.
- Have you met her boyfriend--

29:39.511 --> 29:41.280
her married boyfriend?

29:41.313 --> 29:43.382
- No.
- That's a yes.

29:43.415 --> 29:45.484
I can just see that look
in her eyes

29:45.517 --> 29:47.086
is wanting to say yes

29:47.119 --> 29:49.255
but not wanting to
throw her friend under the bus.

29:49.288 --> 29:51.757
So thank you, Ellie,
for proving me right

29:51.858 --> 29:54.961
and giving me some good ammo
to take back to the girls.

29:54.994 --> 29:58.697
If she doesn't, like, own up
to whoever she's dating,

29:58.730 --> 30:00.933
everyone's just gonna keep
talking about her.

30:00.967 --> 30:02.768
- I know, but why do people
care that much?

30:02.801 --> 30:04.470
- It just proves her character

30:04.503 --> 30:07.739
that much more that
she's a dishonest person

30:07.773 --> 30:10.009
who can't be trusted.

30:10.042 --> 30:13.179
If she was my friend, I would
give her advice and be like,

30:13.212 --> 30:15.414
"This isn't gonna
end well for you."

30:15.447 --> 30:16.949
Like, that's really f---ed up.

30:19.585 --> 30:24.590
*

30:24.623 --> 30:27.059
- I've never been in a Porsche.
- Whoa.

30:27.093 --> 30:29.161
- Wait. Is Lisa coming here?
- No, this is to--

30:29.195 --> 30:31.063
- What?
- 'Cause it--this is my job.

30:31.097 --> 30:32.598
This is what
I'm helping her out with.

30:32.631 --> 30:33.866
I'm helping her out with things
that she can't get to right now

30:33.900 --> 30:35.167
'cause she's a busy lady.

30:35.201 --> 30:37.536
- So every year, I get
another car for the summer.

30:37.569 --> 30:40.572
I know it sounds really spoiled,
but I do spoil myself,

30:40.606 --> 30:41.840
and I can't go.

30:41.874 --> 30:43.442
So maybe you could go there.

30:43.475 --> 30:44.776
They've got two
or three options--

30:44.810 --> 30:46.212
and just send me some pictures.

30:46.245 --> 30:48.147
- Do you need me to,
like, test drive them for you?

30:48.180 --> 30:50.216
- No, I don't.

30:50.249 --> 30:51.283
- Hi.
- Hey. How are you doing?

30:51.317 --> 30:52.351
- I'm Katie, yes.

30:52.384 --> 30:53.485
- Hey. I'm Tom.
- Tom, how are you, man?

30:53.519 --> 30:55.221
- Pleasure to meet you.
- Nice to meet you too.

30:55.254 --> 30:57.656
- Lisa wanted me to come
and check out some cars.

30:57.689 --> 30:59.926
- Yeah. This is what I think
she's gonna love.

30:59.959 --> 31:01.427
- Ooh, that's hot.

31:01.460 --> 31:03.095
What it would be
to, like, lease this?

31:03.129 --> 31:05.497
- With about $20,000 down,

31:05.531 --> 31:07.766
you're probably around
about $4,500 a month.

31:07.799 --> 31:09.335
- Oh, my God.

31:09.368 --> 31:11.237
I'm working on about,
like, $350 a month.

31:11.270 --> 31:12.939
- Yeah.
[laughter]

31:12.939 --> 31:14.173
- Hop in.
- If you say so.

31:14.206 --> 31:15.707
- Are we gonna take it
for a spin?

31:15.741 --> 31:17.609
- It's for Lisa, so don't worry.

31:17.643 --> 31:18.945
- Oh, God.

31:18.978 --> 31:21.580
Purchasing a $175,000 Porsche
to me is,

31:21.613 --> 31:23.649
like, almost in the realm of,
like, fantasy.

31:23.682 --> 31:26.118
- Hop on in.
- This is a beautiful thing.

31:26.152 --> 31:28.320
Like, I feel like I have
as good a chance

31:28.354 --> 31:30.089
as getting a dragon, you know,

31:30.122 --> 31:32.358
and riding it into the sun.

31:32.391 --> 31:36.262
- I'm going to Vegas.
- Bye. Thank you.

31:36.295 --> 31:37.964
- Whoo!
- Whoo-hoo!

31:37.964 --> 31:39.999
Feel that between my legs.

31:40.032 --> 31:41.167
- Yeah, feel it.
- Yeah.

31:41.200 --> 31:43.269
- Hit it. Whoo!

31:45.637 --> 31:47.806
- God, I just had a realization.

31:47.839 --> 31:49.976
If we don't have a wedding,
we can get a Porsche.

31:49.976 --> 31:52.979
- That's nonnegotiable.

31:52.979 --> 31:54.746
- Damn, it just
got real in here.

31:56.548 --> 31:59.986
- You don't even joke about
not having a wedding

31:59.986 --> 32:02.854
to a girl three months away
from her own wedding.

32:02.888 --> 32:07.693
It's rude, and it's low,
and it's just straight mean.

32:07.726 --> 32:09.728
- No, no. That was a joke, Bub.
- But--

32:09.761 --> 32:10.997
- That--you know, I--listen--

32:11.030 --> 32:12.531
- I know, but you've got
to stop joking about that.

32:12.564 --> 32:14.866
Just be considerate.
- I'm very considerate.

32:14.900 --> 32:16.635
I'm considering
getting you a Porsche--

32:16.668 --> 32:18.037
- No, you're not, 'cause you
don't want to have a wedding.

32:18.070 --> 32:20.206
So--
- That was a joke. Look at you.

32:20.239 --> 32:21.773
You're su--you're already
super defensive.

32:21.807 --> 32:23.109
It's just, when you freak out,
you're a different person.

32:23.142 --> 32:24.010
- Don't mock me.
Okay, but don't--

32:24.010 --> 32:25.144
- That's not even you.

32:25.177 --> 32:26.212
- When you turn into being
a callous asshole,

32:26.245 --> 32:27.413
that's not you either.

32:27.446 --> 32:28.714
- The only time I'm ever
a callous asshole--

32:28.747 --> 32:30.016
- It's because I do that.
It's my fault.

32:30.016 --> 32:31.183
- Well, it's--once
you've gone--once you--

32:31.217 --> 32:32.351
- Of course.
Yes, I know. It's my fault.

32:32.384 --> 32:33.752
- She keeps saying
she's gonna change.

32:33.785 --> 32:35.854
She keeps saying she's gonna
break these patterns,

32:35.887 --> 32:37.256
you know, that it's gonna stop.

32:37.289 --> 32:38.657
Have I ever just been
an asshole for no reason?

32:38.690 --> 32:41.027
- It's--it takes two
to tango, Tom.

32:41.027 --> 32:43.229
- It's just that I want her
to do something about it

32:43.262 --> 32:45.364
before we can move forward
with the wedding.

32:45.397 --> 32:46.832
- In those moments,
I'm going crazy

32:46.865 --> 32:47.866
and I'm having a meltdown

32:47.899 --> 32:49.168
because you're not
listening to me.

32:49.201 --> 32:50.569
- No, it's because
you've lost control

32:50.602 --> 32:52.038
of your emotions completely.

32:52.071 --> 32:53.672
- No, it's because you're
not listening to me.

32:53.705 --> 32:55.241
- Katie, I'm--
- Can I--can I grow?

32:55.274 --> 32:56.775
Can I move on from this, please?

32:56.808 --> 32:58.144
Can everyone get over--'cause
I'm ready to get over it.

32:58.177 --> 32:59.378
- That's what I'm saying.
Can you?

33:02.314 --> 33:04.283
- This conversation is over.

33:04.316 --> 33:06.118
Cool, Tom.
Try not to insult me more.

33:06.152 --> 33:07.219
- What are you talking about?

33:07.253 --> 33:08.087
- You're doing a really
good job of it.

33:08.120 --> 33:10.322
- Bubba.
- F---ing stop talking.

33:10.356 --> 33:11.690
You're so rude.

33:11.723 --> 33:15.294
Talk about how
your dick doesn't work, either.

33:15.327 --> 33:17.596
- What? My dick works great.

33:31.577 --> 33:38.550

33:38.584 --> 33:40.386
- Scheana says she's
on her way here.

33:40.419 --> 33:42.388
She says she's got
some good gossip.

33:46.258 --> 33:48.094
- Thanks, Mom.
- Yeah, I love hostessing

33:48.127 --> 33:50.429
and, like, having, like,

33:50.462 --> 33:52.798
a dining room table
that I never use.

33:52.831 --> 33:54.866
I miss having Stassi
as a roommate.

33:54.900 --> 33:57.469
Red Bull and vodka at noon.
And just--can I say,

33:57.503 --> 33:59.871
you are the most fun person
I've ever lived with.

33:59.905 --> 34:01.107
- I'm really--right?
I'm really fun.

34:01.140 --> 34:03.275
- You are.
Maybe I won't get my own home.

34:03.309 --> 34:04.876
- It's because I'm happy.

34:04.910 --> 34:06.578
You know, lucky for me,
I just have to, like,

34:06.612 --> 34:09.881
lure her over
with food and alcohol.

34:09.915 --> 34:11.550
It always works.

34:11.583 --> 34:13.852
- Hi.
- Hi.

34:13.885 --> 34:15.287
- Oh, my God, Sporty Spice.

34:15.321 --> 34:17.556
- Yeah. So I scheduled
my trainer this morning,

34:17.589 --> 34:19.024
and then Ellie wanted
to get breakfast, and then--

34:19.125 --> 34:21.160
- Is that what--is that
the juicy gossip

34:21.193 --> 34:23.462
that I need to know right now?
- Give it to her now.

34:23.495 --> 34:24.930
- The Ellie stuff?
- Yeah.

34:24.963 --> 34:28.234
- Okay, I had no idea
her and James, like, dated.

34:28.267 --> 34:29.501
- What?

34:29.535 --> 34:30.902
- Wait, what?
- Okay, so I'm not the only one.

34:30.936 --> 34:32.138
- No.
- No. I didn't know that.

34:32.171 --> 34:34.005
- Oh, yeah.
She didn't tell anyone, clearly,

34:34.039 --> 34:36.142
because she's ashamed.

34:36.142 --> 34:40.512
- Clearly, I upgraded,
like, huge to Carter.

34:40.546 --> 34:43.449
James, on the other hand,
just keeps,

34:43.482 --> 34:45.617
like, kind of going down
the totem pole, you know?

34:45.651 --> 34:48.354
A lot of skanks--
good job, buddy.

34:48.387 --> 34:49.788
- It was around the holidays.

34:49.821 --> 34:51.323
She said she was really lonely.

34:51.357 --> 34:52.724
Up until March--

34:52.758 --> 34:53.992
- But he was
with his girlfriend.

34:54.025 --> 34:54.893
- Hold on. Hold on.

34:54.926 --> 34:56.428
Yeah. So--

34:56.462 --> 34:58.430
- This is so weird.
- And get this.

34:58.464 --> 35:01.433
She took a photo in his bed

35:01.467 --> 35:03.034
that's just kind of,
like, the side of her face,

35:03.068 --> 35:04.903
but, like, you see that
she's, like, in his bed.

35:04.936 --> 35:06.405
Like, the headboard--like,

35:06.438 --> 35:08.174
if he's gonna say
that she's a liar, she's like,

35:08.174 --> 35:11.243
"Well, I have proof I was
in your bed on March 25th."

35:11.277 --> 35:12.711
- I can't even--this is--

35:12.744 --> 35:14.980
Surprise, surprise.

35:15.013 --> 35:17.816
He cheated on me, lied to me.

35:17.849 --> 35:20.186
I am so glad
I dodged that bullet.

35:20.186 --> 35:22.454
- So then that
conversation kind of ends...

35:22.488 --> 35:24.290
- This is so sick. Okay.
- And then get this.

35:24.323 --> 35:26.358
I was asking her about Lala,
and I'm like, "I'm just curious.

35:26.392 --> 35:29.060
Like, have you met
her married boyfriend?"

35:29.094 --> 35:30.296
And she kind of, like,
laughed and was like,

35:30.329 --> 35:31.730
"No, that's not
who she's dating."

35:31.763 --> 35:33.599
- Okay, we've had confirmation
from people

35:33.632 --> 35:35.066
that don't even know each other.

35:35.100 --> 35:36.202
- And that's what I said too.
- That's what I mean.

35:36.235 --> 35:37.669
It's like two degrees
of separation.

35:37.703 --> 35:39.971
We all have separate--all four
of us have separate sources...

35:40.005 --> 35:41.340
- Separate sources--
- That all said the same thing,

35:41.373 --> 35:43.074
and I don't even know
who any of your sources are.

35:43.108 --> 35:46.278
- Exactly, and I'm like,
"No, there was"--she told A,

35:46.312 --> 35:48.314
then Katie's friend in Utah,

35:48.347 --> 35:50.249
and then I have a friend
who worked on a movie with her.

35:50.282 --> 35:52.351
Like, there are so many,
and we know--

35:52.384 --> 35:53.952
- Also, I found out
yesterday

35:53.985 --> 35:55.454
that the way the wife found out

35:55.487 --> 35:59.225
is she went through his phone
and saw sexting videos of them.

35:59.258 --> 36:02.261
both: No.
- Yes. Yes.

36:02.294 --> 36:04.095
- Ew.
- What?

36:04.129 --> 36:05.831
- That's how I feel.

36:05.864 --> 36:07.366
I know from personal experience

36:07.399 --> 36:09.368
we should stop making
sex tapes.

36:09.401 --> 36:13.805
Women of America, stop recording
yourself having sex.

36:13.839 --> 36:15.474
It always gets out there.

36:15.507 --> 36:17.876
This is my PSA.

36:17.909 --> 36:19.411
Like, I thought that, like,

36:19.445 --> 36:21.247
when I stumbled upon
the info that, like,

36:21.247 --> 36:22.614
she was, like, a sugar baby,

36:22.648 --> 36:24.850
I thought that was, like,
the f---ing golden egg.

36:24.883 --> 36:27.253
Every time I think,
like, shadier sh--

36:27.286 --> 36:30.389
can't get, like,
more shady, it gets worse.

36:30.422 --> 36:32.258
- Yeah.
- Listen, I don't care

36:32.258 --> 36:33.825
about Lala's dating life,

36:33.859 --> 36:36.262
but Lala has been
so cruel to Katie,

36:36.262 --> 36:39.331
and if you're coming after
my best friend, you're done.

36:39.365 --> 36:43.802
- She is straight-up
mother----ing skank trash.

36:45.571 --> 36:47.606
- * Lucky stars

36:47.639 --> 36:49.808
* Catch your lucky,
lucky stars *

36:49.841 --> 36:51.943
* We got life
and a beating heart *

36:51.977 --> 36:56.181
- So those are the things
that we're putting up in Pump.

36:56.282 --> 36:58.284
- Yeah. Ooh.

36:58.284 --> 36:59.618
- And all--look at
all these orchids.

36:59.651 --> 37:01.287
They're beautiful, aren't they?
- Oh, my God.

37:01.287 --> 37:02.788
- Every week,

37:02.821 --> 37:05.624
we go to the flower market
or the florist to choose flowers

37:05.657 --> 37:08.327
for Pump,
Villa Blanca, and Sur.

37:08.360 --> 37:11.630
I've always loved
doing huge flower arrangements.

37:11.663 --> 37:13.732
Unfortunately, now,
I don't get as much time

37:13.765 --> 37:15.501
to do them for everywhere,

37:15.534 --> 37:17.403
but if I get
to the flower market,

37:17.436 --> 37:19.037
I really adore it.

37:19.070 --> 37:21.440
- Look at that
little succulent branch.

37:21.473 --> 37:22.541
- You're getting married.

37:22.574 --> 37:24.443
Your succulent days are over.

37:24.476 --> 37:26.945
You don't have to do
that anymore.

37:26.978 --> 37:28.580
Now these are great.

37:28.614 --> 37:30.349
I actually want
to take some for Pump.

37:30.382 --> 37:31.817
Don't you love
that white and green?

37:31.850 --> 37:33.319
That would look
great with silver.

37:33.319 --> 37:35.220
- Oh, yeah.
- That would look gorgeous.

37:35.321 --> 37:37.088
- And then there was
another flower

37:37.122 --> 37:38.324
that I saw
that was really kind of nice.

37:38.324 --> 37:39.591
It had, like, a bunch of,
like, straight,

37:39.625 --> 37:41.059
like, petals, like that.

37:41.092 --> 37:42.694
- It looks like a daisy?
- No.

37:42.728 --> 37:44.763
It looks almost like a--
if, like,

37:44.796 --> 37:47.666
a carnation wasn't,
like, petals like that.

37:47.699 --> 37:49.735
- Katie doesn't really know
much about flowers.

37:49.768 --> 37:50.969
I don't think she knows
the difference

37:51.002 --> 37:52.638
between a dandelion
and daffodil.

37:52.671 --> 37:55.441
So maybe today I'll give her
a bit of an education.

37:55.474 --> 37:57.175
- I'm trying to see
if maybe--

37:57.208 --> 37:58.710
- I don't know,
but this is lovely.

37:58.744 --> 38:01.547
I think these colors would look
beautiful in the woods. It's--

38:01.580 --> 38:04.215
- Oh, yeah.
- So how's it--

38:04.249 --> 38:05.817
how's it going with Schwartz?

38:05.851 --> 38:08.487
- So yesterday we went
to the Porsche dealership,

38:08.520 --> 38:11.357
and I kind of brought up to him
that it's just hard,

38:11.357 --> 38:14.360
sometimes, when I feel like
he's not hearing me

38:14.360 --> 38:16.728
or he's not listening
or he's def--getting defensive

38:16.762 --> 38:18.397
right away or something
like that that I--

38:18.430 --> 38:19.765
- About what?
What kind of things?

38:19.798 --> 38:21.266
- Just, like, how--where
I go to the dark side

38:21.367 --> 38:24.370
and I sort of take things
further than it needs to go.

38:24.370 --> 38:27.272
- I get it. You know,
when you're married,

38:27.373 --> 38:28.740
there are so many things

38:28.774 --> 38:30.909
that are gonna come your way
that are gonna piss you off

38:30.942 --> 38:33.379
or--you know,
choose your battles.

38:33.379 --> 38:35.514
I hope they're not
turning a blind eye

38:35.547 --> 38:39.284
and not dealing with the essence
of their relationship.

38:39.385 --> 38:40.386
- Give me the benefit
of the doubt,

38:40.419 --> 38:41.853
and give me
the credit I deserve.

38:41.887 --> 38:44.423
- I see problems in the mist.

38:46.124 --> 38:48.694
That's great.
Okay, how much is that?

38:48.727 --> 38:50.729
- Your total comes to $310.76.

38:50.762 --> 38:52.498
- You take that to Sur,

38:52.531 --> 38:55.467
and that I'm gonna try in Pump.
I've got some.

38:55.501 --> 38:58.003
If not, he will live
at Villa Rosa.

38:58.036 --> 39:01.306
How gorgeous that succulent
is there, Katie.

39:20.225 --> 39:23.261

you're on the swag wagon.

39:23.294 --> 39:25.464
- What's up?
- How are you?

39:25.497 --> 39:27.766
- What you got there?

39:27.799 --> 39:29.300
- I was gonna bring you water,

39:29.334 --> 39:31.437
but then I figured
I couldn't be a hypocrite,

39:31.437 --> 39:33.505
because I get in just
as much trouble drinking as you.

39:33.539 --> 39:34.873
- Thank you. Mwah, mwah.

39:34.906 --> 39:36.642
It wasn't about drinking,
was it?

39:38.610 --> 39:40.546
- No, I'm not.

39:40.579 --> 39:42.113
- You sound very drunk.

39:42.147 --> 39:43.649
- Yeah, it was a little bit
about drinking.

39:43.682 --> 39:45.817
- Was it because of
the night with GG?

39:45.851 --> 39:48.353
- It wasn't
because of--no, yeah,

39:48.454 --> 39:50.121
it was that night, but it's
nothing to do with GG, dude.

39:50.155 --> 39:52.458
Why do you keep talking
about that girl?

39:52.458 --> 39:53.959
It's ridiculous.
I didn't f--- GG,

40:00.466 --> 40:02.300
There's only so much cake
to go around.

40:02.468 --> 40:06.304
- I get you, but then,
when I'm on a hike with Ellie

40:06.337 --> 40:08.840
and--do you have something

40:08.874 --> 40:10.676
that you want
to tell me about you two?

40:10.709 --> 40:14.112
- No. Why?
What is she saying now?

40:14.145 --> 40:15.447
- Well, she showed me something.

40:15.481 --> 40:19.384
- What?
- The photo of you two together

40:19.417 --> 40:22.153
in that bed in March.

40:22.187 --> 40:23.555
- She's lying to you.

40:25.390 --> 40:28.093
So let's see it.
I want to see this.

40:30.996 --> 40:34.232
God, this girl, taking pictures
of me when I'm sleeping--

40:34.265 --> 40:36.835
that f---ing means absolutely,
like, nothing.

40:36.868 --> 40:38.236
- You're not worried about it?
- No.

40:38.269 --> 40:40.772
I haven't had sex with Ellie
since December.

40:40.806 --> 40:43.809
I met Raquel
New Year's Eve, 2015,

40:43.842 --> 40:47.746
and my d--- has never been
inside Ellie in 2016.

40:47.779 --> 40:51.416
That was a 2015 smash.
Do you know how easy it is?

You can change f---ing

that she's Photoshopped this?

40:56.888 --> 40:59.090
- Or whatever it is, yeah.
It's all fake, yeah.

40:59.124 --> 41:01.527
It's, like, girl, can you
believe me for a f---ing minute?

41:01.560 --> 41:03.361
"I can show you a photo of you
guys in that bed in March."

41:03.394 --> 41:04.996
- I did not approach it
that way. I--

41:05.030 --> 41:06.732
- It's, like, f--- off.
Get out of here.

41:06.765 --> 41:08.199
It's bullsh--.

we're gonna have a big problem.

41:10.536 --> 41:11.870

41:11.903 --> 41:13.438
- Stop f---ing doing that.
- What are you gonna do then?

41:13.539 --> 41:15.173
- That is how you ruin
friendships,

41:15.206 --> 41:16.575
by threatening and hanging sh--
over someone--

41:16.608 --> 41:17.876

ruin friendships too.

41:38.063 --> 41:40.966
- Do I think the guy's married?
Probably.

41:40.999 --> 41:42.868
If she wants to go ahead and do
that, then that's her business,

41:42.901 --> 41:45.236
but if you're lying to your
enemies and your friends,

41:45.270 --> 41:47.172
it's not exactly building
a good case for you.

41:47.205 --> 41:48.974
- The last time I brought up--
- So he hasn't got a girlfriend

41:49.007 --> 41:51.242
or something
that you need to wait?

41:51.276 --> 41:52.477
- No, that's not it.

41:52.578 --> 41:55.080
- Then why are you being
so secretive?

41:55.113 --> 41:56.815
- It's not that
I'm being secretive--

41:56.848 --> 41:59.918
- You are.
You haven't told one person.

41:59.951 --> 42:02.220
Do you want to put yourself
in that situation, Lala?

42:02.253 --> 42:05.190
Go ahead, but I am not gonna
f---ing sit there and be like,

42:05.223 --> 42:06.992
"I f---ing wish
I was there for you,"

42:07.025 --> 42:08.594
'cause I am here
for you right now.

42:08.627 --> 42:10.662
- I know.
- Then we're done.

42:13.264 --> 42:15.834
- Next time on
"Vanderpump Rules"...

42:15.867 --> 42:17.068
- Yes.
- Ready for Pride?

42:17.102 --> 42:18.403
- Whoo!
- Do it.

42:18.436 --> 42:20.271
- The anticipation is killing
me. What are we wearing?

42:20.305 --> 42:22.240
- Does anybody want
to try this on?

42:22.273 --> 42:24.610
- I don't have underwear on.

42:24.643 --> 42:26.011
- Ariana, she's doing
our cocktails,

42:26.044 --> 42:28.446
but I think I want to talk
to her about possibly, like--

42:28.479 --> 42:30.081
- You can do it together.
- Yeah.

42:30.115 --> 42:33.151
- You're not gonna
take attention away from me.

42:33.184 --> 42:36.087
Don't f---ing roll your eyes,
you little f---ing bitch.

42:37.455 --> 42:38.957
[sirens wailing]

42:38.990 --> 42:41.860
- There's just such a somber
shadow on today

42:41.893 --> 42:45.163
in light of what's happened.
I'm just truly devastated.

42:49.034 --> 42:50.535
- I'm a little freaked out.
- Well, what do we do?

42:50.636 --> 42:54.239
We capitulate?
- It's just so sad.

42:54.272 --> 42:56.007
- To see more
of "Vanderpump Rules,"
