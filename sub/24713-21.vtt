19:47.019 --> 19:47.978
COME ON, GAR.

19:50.731 --> 19:53.567
YOU KNOW THIS GUY?

19:53.567 --> 19:56.278
HE'S BEEN AFTER THIS CATES FOR
A WHILE, I GUESS.

19:56.278 --> 19:58.363
HE'S A LITTLE...INVESTED.

20:02.409 --> 20:04.411
ALL RIGHT, "FATHER,"

20:04.411 --> 20:06.997
YOU'RE TALKING
TO A CATHOLIC SCHOOL KID,

PERSONAL.

20:08.999 --> 20:10.876
SO ADMIT YOU'RE A PHONY NOW,

20:10.876 --> 20:14.296
OR YOU WON'T LEAVE THIS ROOM
WITH YOUR TEETH INTACT.

20:14.296 --> 20:17.549
I GUESS I AM MORE OF A
PRIVATE DO-GOODER, EH?

20:17.549 --> 20:19.843
A PRIVATE DO-GOODER WHO
TAKES SWIPES AT WOMEN?

20:19.843 --> 20:21.511

20:37.444 --> 20:38.987

FRIEND.

20:38.987 --> 20:40.113

20:47.037 --> 20:50.749
ALL RIGHT, LOOK, THE TRUTH --
BUT IT CAN'T GET BACK TO ME.

20:50.749 --> 20:54.211
SHE HAS A BAD HEROIN PROBLEM,
AND SHE WANTS TO QUIT.

20:54.211 --> 20:56.713
BUT SHE'S ASHAMED TO TELL HER
FOLKS,

20:56.713 --> 20:59.216
SO I SAID I'D HELP OUT.
BY RUNNING A CON.

20:59.216 --> 21:00.842
IT WAS HER IDEA.

21:00.842 --> 21:03.178
WHERE ARE WE GOING
TO FIND LUISA?

21:03.178 --> 21:04.638
I JUST SEE HER WHEN I SEE HER.

21:04.638 --> 21:06.306
SO IF THIS WENT ACCORDING
TO PLAN,

21:06.306 --> 21:08.267
YOU WOULD HAVE JUST HELD ON
TO HER GRAND

21:08.267 --> 21:09.977
UNTIL YOU HAPPENED
ON EACH OTHER.

WHERE IS SHE?

21:27.911 --> 21:30.038
SHE'S NOT GOING TO CONFIRM IT.
SHE'LL PUT IT ALL ON ME.

22:18.211 --> 22:21.173
DID HE TOUCH THE PACK
OF CIGARETTES THAT HE ASKED FOR

22:21.173 --> 22:23.175
BEFORE THIS WHOLE THING
WENT DOWN?
YEAH.

22:23.175 --> 22:25.761
HE WAS KNOCKING 'EM
AGAINST HIS PALM,

22:25.761 --> 22:27.262
AND THEN HE SET 'EM DOWN.

22:27.262 --> 22:28.847
ALL RIGHT.

22:28.847 --> 22:30.640
THIS IS A MURDER INVESTIGATION,

22:30.640 --> 22:32.601
SO I DON'T CARE
ABOUT ANYTHING ELSE.

22:32.601 --> 22:35.604
DID YOUR UNCLE BUY STOLEN
CIGARETTES AND RESELL 'EM?

22:35.604 --> 22:37.356
NO.
WE BUY 'EM LEGIT.

25:09.257 --> 25:12.302
LITTLE UPDATE FOR US
FROM COMMUNICATIONS.

25:12.302 --> 25:15.013
GARY DIDN'T MAKE THE 911 CALL
FROM THE DELI.

25:15.013 --> 25:17.766
HE MADE IT FROM A PAY PHONE TWO
BLOCKS DOWN.

25:17.766 --> 25:19.351
SO I RUN GARY.

25:19.351 --> 25:22.437
HE'S ON PROBATION FOR DEALING
COKE TWO YEARS AGO.

25:29.402 --> 25:31.988
I'M ALMOST DONE HERE.

25:31.988 --> 25:34.074
NOW, WHAT HAPPENED AT THE DELI
THIS MORNING, GARY?

25:34.074 --> 25:36.117

TWO BLOCKS AWAY.

25:41.957 --> 25:43.917
OKAY, SO I CALLED FROM DOWN
THE BLOCK

25:43.917 --> 25:45.877
AFTER I CHASED THE GUYS.

25:45.877 --> 25:47.671
IT'S NOT LIKE THERE WASN'T
A LOT GOING ON.

25:57.806 --> 25:59.558
I CHASED THOSE TWO

EYES OFF ME,

SO I DOVE AROUND THE CORNER
AND I RAN OUT THE BACK DOOR.

26:10.610 --> 26:13.238
THAT'S WHEN I HEARD
THE GUNSHOT.

26:13.238 --> 26:15.574

PICKED OUT YOUR BROTHER KELVIN

35:22.537 --> 35:25.039
AS THE GUY KEEPING AN EYE OUT
BY THE DOOR,

35:25.039 --> 35:27.458

WE HAD THE RIGHT GUY.

OR MAYBE THIS ROBBERY WAS
KELVIN'S IDEA,

35:52.024 --> 35:54.569
WHICH MEANS
HE'LL GET EVEN MORE TIME.

35:54.569 --> 35:57.697
WE CAN MAKE THAT HAPPEN, TOO,
IF YOU KEEP SITTING HERE POSING.

HE HAD NOTHING
TO DO WITH THIS.

36:21.345 --> 36:23.139

TOOK OFF.

ABOUT IT.

36:42.325 --> 36:43.743
LEAVE HIM OUT OF THIS.

36:43.743 --> 36:45.161

CONVERSATION?

38:30.224 --> 38:32.101
ABOUT WHAT, YOU AND ME?

38:32.101 --> 38:34.186
WELL, I JUST KNOW WHAT
YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH,

38:34.186 --> 38:38.607
AND YOU CAN TALK TO ME
ABOUT ANYTHING...OR NOT.

38:38.607 --> 38:41.277

'CAUSE I DON'T WANT
TO JINX A GOOD THING.

38:43.279 --> 38:45.072
WELL, THERE'S NOTHING
TO SAY

38:45.072 --> 38:46.782

THING GOING.

38:46.782 --> 38:48.784
I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW MUCH
I'D LIKE THAT TO HAPPEN,

38:48.784 --> 38:52.955
BUT, UM, I KEEP THINKING
ANOTHER SHOE'S GOING TO DROP.

THAT'S WHO I AM.

39:02.173 --> 39:04.717
I'M NOT TRYING TO GET US AHEAD
OF OURSELVES.

39:04.717 --> 39:09.221
HOWEVER LONG THIS LASTS,
I JUST WANT TO ENJOY IT.

39:09.221 --> 39:10.556
THAT'S GOOD FOR ME.

40:16.122 --> 40:21.210
THIRD FLOOR, ONE QUEEN.
YEAH, SOUNDS GOOD.

40:21.210 --> 40:22.545
HERE YOU GO.
THANK YOU.

40:22.545 --> 40:25.089
DAD, YOU COULD PUT ONE IN
YOUR BAG.

40:25.089 --> 40:27.466
I'M NOT GOING TO HAVE ANY ROOM
FOR MY STUFF, THEO.

40:27.466 --> 40:30.678
LOOK, I-I SAID ONE TOY,
BUT IT CAN'T BE THE FIRE TRUCK.

40:30.678 --> 40:33.848
BUT WHAT IF I NEED IT?

40:33.848 --> 40:35.808
THANKS.

40:35.808 --> 40:38.519
I, UH, I'M ON THE FLOOR
BELOW YOU GUYS.

40:38.519 --> 40:40.229
PERFECT.

40:40.229 --> 40:43.941
YOU KNOW...

40:43.941 --> 40:47.611
WHY I'D WANT YOU TO COME
WITH ME IS A NO-BRAINER, BUT...

40:47.611 --> 40:50.156
WHY YOU'D ACTUALLY SAY YES IS
SOMETHING

40:50.156 --> 40:54.118
I-I'M HAVING A HARD TIME
GETTING MY HEAD AROUND.

40:54.118 --> 41:00.249
WHATEVER IT IS I DO FOR YOU,
HOWEVER I MAKE YOU FEEL,

41:00.249 --> 41:03.335
YOU DO THE SAME FOR ME.

41:03.335 --> 41:05.588
I CAN'T IMAGINE HAVING THAT KIND
OF LUCK.

41:05.588 --> 41:10.009
WELL, YOU DON'T HAVE
TO IMAGINE ANYTHING.

41:10.009 --> 41:14.472
IT'S RIGHT HERE.

41:14.472 --> 41:16.974
I NEED SOMEONE BIG TO STAND
ON MY BAG

41:16.974 --> 41:18.809
SO I CAN CLOSE IT.

41:18.809 --> 41:21.228
ALL RIGHT, WHY DON'T WE SEE IF
WE CAN PARE IT DOWN

41:21.228 --> 41:23.481
A LITTLE BIT FIRST,
OKAY, KIDDO?

41:23.481 --> 41:24.690
FINE.

41:26.984 --> 41:30.905
CONNIE, I'M GLAD YOU'RE COMING.

41:30.905 --> 41:33.491
ME TOO.

41:33.491 --> 41:35.201
COME ON.

41:37.745 --> 41:40.831
ALL RIGHT,
LET ME SEE THIS BAG.

41:40.831 --> 41:42.833
THIS IS TOO MUCH, SWEETIE.

41:42.833 --> 41:44.835
WE HAVE TO TAKE THIS OFF
FIRST.

41:44.835 --> 41:46.921
OH! WHOA, WHOA,
WHOA, WHOA.

41:46.921 --> 41:48.964
THEO...

41:59.350 --> 42:02.269
