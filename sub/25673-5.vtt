WEBVTT

00:00.001 --> 00:03.024
- I have feelings for you!
- I have feelings for you, too!

00:03.049 --> 00:04.817
I'm going to break you

00:04.842 --> 00:07.134
and watch you hunt each
other to the death.

00:07.159 --> 00:09.038
Jess! No!

00:09.063 --> 00:11.919
- Where am I?
- Her brains are scrambled!

00:11.943 --> 00:13.150
She thinks she's in college.

00:13.175 --> 00:15.055
I can't be your wife.

00:15.080 --> 00:18.243
I guess today is the first day
of me trying to win you back.

00:19.296 --> 00:20.839
'Sup, Jess?

00:21.025 --> 00:22.692
Brought you a bucket of water.

00:22.717 --> 00:24.448
I thought you might want to hydrate up

00:24.473 --> 00:27.281
before we all get around to
murdering each other tomorrow.

00:27.306 --> 00:29.774
Murder. Why would I say murder?

00:29.799 --> 00:32.019
Oh, my God, Todd. What
is wrong with you?

00:32.043 --> 00:34.099
Just be Todd, all right?

00:34.271 --> 00:37.951
You're a boss and a pimp.
You got this, man.

00:39.928 --> 00:42.755
You and I both know you're the
key to getting out of here.

00:42.780 --> 00:44.920
Please, just tell me how to use you.

00:45.149 --> 00:47.030
If you put it here,
this is where we can

00:47.055 --> 00:48.142
bounce over the wall.

00:48.167 --> 00:49.421
- On a trampoline?
- Yeah.

00:49.446 --> 00:50.226
Where will we get one?

00:50.251 --> 00:51.871
- So, is L.A., like, so crazy?
- That's where she comes in.

00:51.896 --> 00:54.869
- Yeah, I guess.
- That's so crazy.

00:54.894 --> 00:57.276
'Sup, Jess?

00:57.301 --> 00:59.744
Thought you might be thirsty,
so I brought you a bucket

00:59.769 --> 01:02.142
of water from that
weird pipe over there.

01:03.756 --> 01:05.423
Okay.

01:06.950 --> 01:08.617
You remember anything yet?

01:08.642 --> 01:10.509
- Nope.
- Getting closer, though?

01:10.534 --> 01:12.568
No. Why would you think that?

01:12.593 --> 01:14.848
Just thought I saw a little
twinkle in you eyes, that's all.

01:14.873 --> 01:16.322
There's no twinkle.

01:16.347 --> 01:18.489
No twinkle. Got it. Yep.

01:18.722 --> 01:20.664
Well, hey...

01:21.581 --> 01:23.553
let a homey know.

01:24.599 --> 01:26.332
Okay, bye.

01:26.357 --> 01:27.888
Thanks, Todd.

01:28.185 --> 01:29.880
Oh, I'd actually like
a cup of that water.

01:29.905 --> 01:31.170
Oh, my God, totally.

01:31.195 --> 01:32.805
You know, water's, like, so basic,

01:32.830 --> 01:34.271
but it's still so good, right?

01:34.296 --> 01:36.689
I think it's pretty
important to life, yeah.

01:38.748 --> 01:40.680
You're so funny.

01:40.705 --> 01:43.601
Okay. I mean, I guess I'm
sort of funny, yeah.

01:44.221 --> 01:46.346
Holy Mother of God.

01:46.692 --> 01:48.625
Jess has a boner for Pack.

01:48.650 --> 01:52.619
- Synced and corrected by martythecrazy -
- www.addic7ed.com -

01:52.644 --> 01:54.830
It seems like our only chance
to trounce these rich dicks

01:54.855 --> 01:56.521
is tomorrow at the Hunt.

01:56.674 --> 01:58.808
I don't see how, unless
we can find a way

01:58.833 --> 02:01.063
to deactivate these bracelets.

02:01.088 --> 02:03.290
You don't think anyone's gonna
turn on each other, do you?

02:03.315 --> 02:06.224
No. No, they won't.

02:06.546 --> 02:10.115
Not as long as the Dream
Team stays strong.

02:10.250 --> 02:12.165
We're the twisty tie that holds

02:12.190 --> 02:14.392
this whole bag of bread together.

02:14.492 --> 02:17.101
And as long as we don't get
lost on the countertops

02:17.126 --> 02:18.847
or chewed up by a dog

02:18.872 --> 02:21.787
or fall between the
fridge and the wall...

02:21.812 --> 02:24.130
- What are you talking about?
- Yeah, you lost me at the dog thing.

02:24.155 --> 02:26.264
Whoo, that one got away from me there.

02:26.289 --> 02:28.140
Oh, I'm sorry, wow.

02:28.165 --> 02:29.277
Speeches are hard.

02:29.302 --> 02:30.753
You don't get enough credit for that.

02:30.778 --> 02:32.290
Heads up.

02:35.939 --> 02:37.739
Tomorrow is the Hunt.

02:37.765 --> 02:41.233
Most of you will die,
some sooner than others.

02:41.258 --> 02:43.709
But Mr. Stanwick is a gracious man.

02:43.734 --> 02:46.192
He has asked me to take your order.

02:46.217 --> 02:47.216
What order?

02:47.241 --> 02:48.608
For your final meal.

02:48.633 --> 02:51.687
This may be the last time you ever eat.

02:52.090 --> 02:54.757
Collectively, you will choose one meal,

02:54.782 --> 02:56.441
which I will prepare.

02:56.466 --> 02:58.637
Anything your heart desires.

02:58.852 --> 03:01.789
So... what will it be?

03:03.568 --> 03:05.167
We should eat something.

03:05.192 --> 03:08.370
No point in depriving
ourselves of useful calories.

03:08.395 --> 03:09.747
Yeah, yeah, okay, um...

03:09.772 --> 03:11.314
What about pizza? Everyone
loves pizza, right?

03:11.339 --> 03:12.535
- Yeah.
- Oh, my God, yes.

03:12.560 --> 03:13.470
- Pizza.
- Okay.

03:13.494 --> 03:14.531
- I'm happy with pizza.
- Fine by me.

03:14.556 --> 03:15.866
As long as it's got meat on it.

03:15.891 --> 03:18.104
- Yeah.
- Martha, can you do pizza?

03:18.129 --> 03:21.304
Can I top a flat piece of
bread with sauce and cheese?

03:21.329 --> 03:23.290
Yes, I think I can...

03:23.741 --> 03:25.473
"do" pizza.

03:25.498 --> 03:27.365
Oh, man, I love pizza!

03:27.390 --> 03:29.581
Shut up. I love pizza.

03:29.606 --> 03:31.614
- That's so crazy, though, we like the same thing.
- I mean, everybody kind of loves pizza.

03:31.639 --> 03:33.328
Wait!

03:35.339 --> 03:37.228
No pizza.

03:38.108 --> 03:39.311
Why not?

03:39.336 --> 03:41.339
Because it's...

03:42.020 --> 03:46.474
greasy and slimy and soft.

03:46.705 --> 03:48.374
It sucks!

03:48.399 --> 03:49.816
Well, Todd, you have a better idea?

03:49.841 --> 03:51.541
Oh, yeah, I do.

03:51.566 --> 03:53.875
Something that's actually satisfying

03:54.017 --> 03:57.217
and badass, like ribs.

03:58.060 --> 04:01.136
Yeah, big old slab of baby-back ribs.

04:01.161 --> 04:02.362
Nom, nom, nom, nom.

04:02.387 --> 04:04.956
Okay. I'll have to fire up the smoker.

04:04.981 --> 04:07.682
- Fire up that smoker.
- I want a pizza, but ribs is fine.

04:07.707 --> 04:08.487
- I like it.
- Ribs and sauces.

04:08.512 --> 04:11.757
Wait! Not ribs, okay?

04:11.782 --> 04:14.783
At least with pizza, I
could pick the meat off.

04:14.808 --> 04:16.043
If we get to choose our last meal,

04:16.067 --> 04:18.221
we can't just have a slab of ribs.

04:18.245 --> 04:20.052
- That's insane.
- Why not?

04:20.077 --> 04:23.065
Red meat is terrible for
the environment, okay?

04:23.090 --> 04:27.771
And also, you know, goes without
saying... meat is murder.

04:28.656 --> 04:30.747
- Boo!
- Boring!

04:30.772 --> 04:31.836
I don't understand.

04:31.861 --> 04:33.726
Ever since we crashed,

04:33.751 --> 04:36.759
you've been sucking the boar
meat straight off the bone.

04:36.784 --> 04:39.136
I had no other choice. I was starving.

04:39.161 --> 04:40.628
Oh, s-so you're a hypocrite?

04:40.653 --> 04:42.180
I'm not a hypocrite.

04:42.205 --> 04:43.937
I value all life.

04:43.962 --> 04:45.565
Didn't you kill a dude
with a chili pepper?

04:45.590 --> 04:47.255
Okay, you know what?

04:47.280 --> 04:50.349
If I die tomorrow, I die
with my principles intact.

04:50.374 --> 04:53.544
I demand plant-based foods only.

04:53.569 --> 04:54.808
- Ohh, man.
- That sounds horrible!

04:54.833 --> 04:56.251
I want a pizza!

04:56.276 --> 04:58.584
I'm a man. I'm not a rabbit.

04:58.609 --> 05:00.968
Yeah, if I wanted to die
smelling veggie farts,

05:00.993 --> 05:03.235
I would've let that drifter
kill me in Portland, okay?

05:03.260 --> 05:07.053
No, no, no, no. We all need
at least 36 grams of protein.

05:07.078 --> 05:10.527
36 grams? Isn't that gonna
overload your circuit board?

05:10.552 --> 05:12.949
Enough! Don't you see?

05:12.974 --> 05:15.619
This is just another
one of Declan's games.

05:15.644 --> 05:18.309
We're all just prawns
on his chest board.

05:18.334 --> 05:20.197
Ooh, shrimp would be nice.

05:20.222 --> 05:23.288
The only way to beat Declan
is to just not play at all,

05:23.721 --> 05:26.125
which is why I think we
should hunger strike.

05:26.150 --> 05:27.883
Now, who's with me?

05:31.092 --> 05:33.643
No one? Not a single...

05:34.072 --> 05:35.938
Jess. Come on.

05:35.963 --> 05:38.034
We used to always team
up in the old days.

05:38.059 --> 05:39.423
- Really?
- Yeah.

05:39.448 --> 05:41.396
You probably can't remember
'cause of your mushy brain.

05:41.421 --> 05:42.599
Okay, that's rude. Come on.

05:42.624 --> 05:44.380
Do not take advantage of her.

05:44.405 --> 05:47.922
Whatever! Enjoy your food, losers.

05:47.947 --> 05:50.934
Okay, listen up. We're clearly
not getting anywhere.

05:50.959 --> 05:53.281
Somebody needs to just make a decision.
I'll pick.

05:53.306 --> 05:55.200
I'm sorry, who made you leader?

05:55.225 --> 05:56.108
Okay, no...

05:56.133 --> 05:58.538
No one actually made
me the leader, right?

05:58.563 --> 06:00.630
But since no one else ever steps up,

06:00.655 --> 06:03.323
here I am, making the tough decisions.

06:03.348 --> 06:07.016
And I say we go with a classic...
steak dinner.

06:07.041 --> 06:08.746
Oh, great choice!

06:08.771 --> 06:11.057
It's a classic for a reason.

06:11.082 --> 06:12.501
Uh, steak?

06:12.611 --> 06:14.867
Did you not hear anything I just said?

06:14.892 --> 06:17.125
Yeah, but there's gonna
be a bunch of sides.

06:17.150 --> 06:18.273
You know what they say...

06:18.298 --> 06:20.093
With steak, sides make the meal.

06:20.118 --> 06:21.725
Okay. Florence, I can't
please everybody.

06:21.750 --> 06:23.039
I'm not asking you to please everyone.

06:23.064 --> 06:24.603
I'm asking you to support me.

06:24.628 --> 06:26.404
Don't waste your time, bro.

06:26.608 --> 06:29.102
She's gonna get her brains
all scrambled, anyway,

06:29.127 --> 06:30.648
and leave you.

06:30.673 --> 06:31.579
They always do.

06:31.604 --> 06:33.227
Dude, seriously, you need to chill out.

06:33.252 --> 06:34.872
I wasn't even talking about you.

06:37.913 --> 06:39.582
- How do they always do it?
- They always do.

06:39.607 --> 06:41.184
Silence!

06:43.867 --> 06:47.068
What do you want?

06:47.093 --> 06:49.402
- Pizza!
- A steak dinner with a lot of sides.

06:49.427 --> 06:51.046
Olive tapenade.

06:51.071 --> 06:52.636
- I like pizza, though.
- Both of us, because...

06:52.661 --> 06:56.757
Okay! You idiots have one hour
to decide what you're having.

06:56.782 --> 07:01.728
Otherwise, you're eating PB&Js.

07:02.783 --> 07:04.210
- Okay. Yeah.
- Okay.

07:04.235 --> 07:05.370
That's actually a pretty good idea.

07:05.395 --> 07:08.017
And it won't be the fancy PB&Js

07:08.042 --> 07:09.604
with nice bread and stuff.

07:09.629 --> 07:11.249
It'll be the shit ones

07:11.274 --> 07:15.258
with unsalted peanut butter
and not enough jelly.

07:17.000 --> 07:23.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

07:24.234 --> 07:26.348
Okay. Let's try this again.

07:26.373 --> 07:27.889
Sweet and sour pork...

07:27.914 --> 07:30.444
"love it," "hate it," or "eh, fine."

07:30.469 --> 07:31.800
Go.

07:35.878 --> 07:38.900
And feel free to join me
in Hunger Strike Corner.

07:38.925 --> 07:40.298
Still plenty of room.

07:40.323 --> 07:41.224
- Be nice, okay?
- Wait!

07:41.249 --> 07:43.417
I want to use my soft veto.

07:43.442 --> 07:46.058
Seriously? I'm sorry, but
ever since that LFO song,

07:46.083 --> 07:47.615
Chinese food has made me sick.

07:47.640 --> 07:50.015
Okay, we've got one soft veto.
Anyone want to match?

07:50.040 --> 07:52.974
- I'll match that.
- I got you, babe. I'm not your babe.

07:52.999 --> 07:56.940
Then you leave me no choice
but to use my challenge.

07:56.965 --> 07:58.704
You can't challenge a match.

07:58.729 --> 08:00.546
That's the whole point of the match.

08:00.571 --> 08:03.250
Wait, but how many vetoes
can we use this round?

08:03.275 --> 08:06.276
Oh, my God. How many times
do I have to go over this?

08:06.301 --> 08:08.323
You get one hard veto and two soft

08:08.348 --> 08:09.981
unless you successfully
challenge a block,

08:10.006 --> 08:11.607
in which case you get
an extra hard veto

08:11.632 --> 08:12.760
and the option to zig a zag.

08:12.785 --> 08:15.386
It's not that difficult, people!

08:15.411 --> 08:18.946
Soft veto, hard veto...
Who gives a shit?

08:18.971 --> 08:22.952
What we should be talking
about is soft or hard tacos.

08:22.977 --> 08:25.443
Absolutely. I want tacos!

08:25.468 --> 08:26.819
- Wait. What?
- Tacos.

08:26.844 --> 08:28.934
- Oh, man.
- You guys, I'm sorry.

08:28.959 --> 08:31.049
I got to super block tacos.

08:31.074 --> 08:32.506
- No!
- No!

08:32.532 --> 08:34.331
I don't want to have the runs
when we're on the run, okay?

08:34.356 --> 08:35.712
That is disgusting. You're
talking about poop.

08:35.736 --> 08:37.323
What kind of tacos do
you think we're eating?

08:37.349 --> 08:39.073
- Oh, I agree. Eww!
- All right!

08:39.174 --> 08:42.013
Let's just look at what
we have right now, okay?

08:42.038 --> 08:47.083
So far, the meal with the most
points is the turkey sandwich,

08:47.108 --> 08:51.169
in which everyone is an "eh,
fine," except for Pack.

08:51.194 --> 08:53.193
Come on, you guys want
to have a cold sandwich

08:53.218 --> 08:54.405
for your last meal ever?

08:54.430 --> 08:56.052
- Absolutely, we do.
- Sure.

08:56.077 --> 08:57.409
You know what? Fine.

08:57.434 --> 08:59.969
I'm starving, so turkey sandwich it is.

08:59.994 --> 09:01.666
Yay.

09:01.691 --> 09:03.806
Nope! Then I hate it. Oh, my God.

09:03.831 --> 09:04.678
- What?
- What?

09:04.703 --> 09:07.237
- What is happening?
- Okay, friend.

09:07.730 --> 09:11.666
You have been directly
opposed to Pack every vote.

09:11.732 --> 09:14.097
Erratic behavior is an emotional cue.

09:14.122 --> 09:15.539
What is going on?

09:18.292 --> 09:20.893
All right, you want to know
what's going on? Fine.

09:21.360 --> 09:24.520
Pack is using Jess' soupy brain

09:24.545 --> 09:27.371
to trick her into having
feelings for him.

09:27.396 --> 09:31.507
Oh, excuse me for a minute.

09:33.608 --> 09:35.248
- Do you have feelings for me?
- What?

09:35.273 --> 09:38.140
I mean, it's, like, whatever.
Who cares?

09:38.165 --> 09:40.399
I mean, do you like me or whatever?

09:40.424 --> 09:42.859
You see? The dude's trying to
steal her right in front of me.

09:42.884 --> 09:45.152
Well, technically, isn't
she kind of single?

09:45.177 --> 09:46.859
I mean, her memory's still a bit...

09:46.884 --> 09:47.814
- No. No, she's not.
- Yeah.

09:47.839 --> 09:48.847
- Yes.
- Yeah.

09:48.872 --> 09:50.890
My wife is still in there.
I know it. Okay.

09:50.915 --> 09:54.398
Jess, at our Cruise-ifornication
Red Hot Chili Wedding,

09:54.423 --> 09:56.009
we made a sacred vow to each other

09:56.034 --> 09:58.021
to always be partners...

09:58.046 --> 10:00.025
In life, love, and Flip Cup...

10:00.050 --> 10:00.890
- What?
- Beer pong.

10:00.915 --> 10:03.400
No. I didn't make a vow to anyone.

10:03.425 --> 10:05.532
I don't even know you.

10:05.557 --> 10:07.037
All I know is that you're a jerk

10:07.062 --> 10:08.600
and you smell like my dad's friends.

10:08.625 --> 10:09.809
Okay, okay, all right,
all right, all right,

10:09.834 --> 10:11.510
all right, all right, all right.

10:11.535 --> 10:14.446
Todd, listen, man, I'm really
sorry about what's happening.

10:14.471 --> 10:17.545
But... the heart wants
what the heart wants.

10:17.570 --> 10:19.055
Oh, you want to start something, bro?!
Let's do it!

10:19.080 --> 10:20.387
- Let's go!
- Come get me!

10:20.412 --> 10:22.329
- Come on. I'm coming.
- Come get... I'm right here!

10:22.354 --> 10:23.816
- No, you're not.
- I'm not going anywhere!

10:23.841 --> 10:25.308
- You are, though.
- I'd never back down from any man.

10:25.333 --> 10:27.219
You're backing down.
You're moving backwards.

10:27.244 --> 10:29.309
Oh, my God. Guys!

10:29.334 --> 10:31.426
- I'd never move!
- Enough! Save it for tomorrow.

10:31.451 --> 10:33.383
I'm sorry. Save what for tomorrow?

10:33.408 --> 10:35.839
Because we're not hunting
each other, right?

10:35.872 --> 10:37.071
Listen.

10:37.096 --> 10:39.212
We may very well band together

10:39.237 --> 10:40.903
and fight our way off this island.

10:40.928 --> 10:42.846
But it's more likely we're
gonna crack under pressure

10:42.871 --> 10:43.770
and kill each other.

10:43.795 --> 10:45.457
- What!
- What are you talking about?!

10:45.482 --> 10:47.613
Either way, we're gonna need fuel.

10:47.638 --> 10:49.326
So just pick a meal.

10:49.351 --> 10:52.753
So you think you could actually
kill us, your friends?

10:52.778 --> 10:54.045
No, Karen.

10:54.169 --> 10:57.037
Before you say anything,
I want you to take...

10:57.062 --> 10:58.557
- Yes, I could.
- A beat!

10:58.582 --> 11:00.133
- Oh, my God!
- Take a beat, Karen!

11:00.158 --> 11:02.958
It's not even fair! She's like
the Wayne Gretzky of murder.

11:02.983 --> 11:04.222
And we don't even know
how to ice skate.

11:04.247 --> 11:06.151
We're just gonna be flopping around

11:06.176 --> 11:07.315
with our cold dicks!

11:07.340 --> 11:09.041
How could you hunt us?

11:09.066 --> 11:10.653
Well, it's very simple, really.

11:10.678 --> 11:12.974
I'll do anything to get back
to Anthony and the girls.

11:12.999 --> 11:14.465
What?

11:14.490 --> 11:16.667
Who are Anthony and the girls?

11:16.692 --> 11:19.516
My husband and my daughters,
Lydia and Eleanor.

11:21.833 --> 11:23.518
You're straight?

11:25.768 --> 11:28.484
You have a family?!

11:28.509 --> 11:30.424
Of course. I'm of breeding age.

11:30.449 --> 11:32.077
I can't believe this.

11:32.340 --> 11:34.084
We stuck our sex junk into each other.

11:34.109 --> 11:34.783
Ohh.

11:34.808 --> 11:36.273
- What?!
- So what?

11:36.298 --> 11:38.798
So what?! You're married!

11:38.990 --> 11:41.194
You lied to me. You're a liar.

11:41.219 --> 11:45.769
Like Jim Carrey in that movie...
"I Can't Stop Fibbing Man."

11:45.794 --> 11:46.505
What?

11:46.530 --> 11:48.148
Maybe it was the New Zealand title.

11:48.173 --> 11:48.928
- Oh.
- Oh.

11:48.953 --> 11:51.091
Marriage is a holy commitment.

11:51.116 --> 11:53.511
- Amen.
- You can't just toss it aside

11:53.536 --> 11:54.950
like a dirty rag.

11:54.975 --> 11:56.308
Amen?

11:56.333 --> 11:57.964
I would never have
cheated on my ex-wife

11:57.989 --> 11:59.395
when I was married to her.

11:59.420 --> 12:01.062
Now I just feel disgusting!

12:01.087 --> 12:02.584
Wait. You were married?

12:02.609 --> 12:03.933
Yes, I was married.

12:03.958 --> 12:05.427
Not that you'd care, any of you,

12:05.452 --> 12:07.462
'cause none of you give
a shit about Steve!

12:07.487 --> 12:08.634
- Well, mm.
- Mm.

12:08.659 --> 12:10.772
First it's all, "Oh, Steve's weird."

12:10.797 --> 12:11.492
Yeah.

12:11.517 --> 12:13.722
And then it's like, "Oh,
Steve's a murderer!"

12:13.747 --> 12:14.438
- You are, yeah.
- Yeah.

12:14.463 --> 12:16.908
And now, "Steve's hunger
strike is stupid!"

12:16.933 --> 12:21.284
Okay, pal. Just kind of relax,
'cause you're acting insane.

12:21.309 --> 12:23.805
Oh, this is insane, is it?
I don't think so.

12:23.830 --> 12:26.765
You haven't seen insane yet.
This is insane!

12:26.790 --> 12:29.211
Aaah! Whoo! Whoo!

12:29.236 --> 12:32.848
Hyyyah! Aaah!

12:32.873 --> 12:34.929
Caw! Caw!

12:34.954 --> 12:36.576
No, no, no, no!

12:38.298 --> 12:40.125
That was the clean one!

12:40.150 --> 12:42.139
Good night, sweethearts!

12:43.296 --> 12:45.807
Stop!

12:45.832 --> 12:47.178
You okay, Jess?

12:47.203 --> 12:49.203
No! I'm not okay.

12:49.228 --> 12:52.044
I just woke up on this island,
and I'm gonna die tomorrow,

12:52.069 --> 12:54.202
and now everyone won't stop screaming.

12:54.227 --> 12:55.686
I'm sorry.

12:55.711 --> 12:58.286
I'm just, like, really
tired and really hungry.

12:58.755 --> 12:59.954
You know what?

12:59.979 --> 13:02.288
After all Jess has been through,

13:02.313 --> 13:03.929
maybe we should just let
her choose what to eat.

13:03.954 --> 13:05.887
Let her choose what to eat, yep.

13:05.912 --> 13:07.915
I said it, too, so if you
thought that was sweet,

13:07.940 --> 13:09.397
I was sweet, too.

13:09.422 --> 13:11.541
- That's a great idea, Pack.
- And Todd.

13:11.566 --> 13:13.734
Jess, what do you want?

13:18.752 --> 13:20.597
Well...

13:22.486 --> 13:23.885
- What do you guys want?
- Oh, no.

13:23.910 --> 13:25.048
- Oh, no.
- I don't know!

13:25.073 --> 13:26.062
You have to pick it.

13:26.087 --> 13:27.420
Ugh, we were so close!

13:27.445 --> 13:29.940
Screw it! You know what?
I need comfort food.

13:29.965 --> 13:31.544
Let's just... Let's just have

13:31.569 --> 13:33.046
the old classic oatmeal and trout.

13:33.071 --> 13:34.595
- Oatmeal and trout?!
- Eww!

13:34.620 --> 13:36.279
- How about...
- How about chicken?

13:36.304 --> 13:38.581
Everybody loves chicken, right?
I'm sorry. Flo?

13:38.606 --> 13:41.362
Fine with me. I'm willing to
compromise just to finish this.

13:41.387 --> 13:44.161
All right, so, what kind
of chicken do we want?

13:44.186 --> 13:47.583
Do we want nuggs? Do we want wings?
Tikka masala?

13:47.608 --> 13:49.839
Let's keep it simple...
Grilled chicken, huh?

13:49.864 --> 13:53.198
Oh, oh, what about fried, right?
Like Momofuku-good fried?

13:53.223 --> 13:54.212
- Mmm. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Yeah.

13:54.237 --> 13:55.180
One final vote.

13:55.205 --> 13:57.007
Grilled or fried chicken,

13:57.032 --> 13:58.639
and then we're done, okay?

13:58.664 --> 13:59.900
Owen, grilled or fried?

13:59.925 --> 14:01.271
Whichever. I don't care.

14:01.296 --> 14:03.099
You have to care. It's for the vote.

14:03.124 --> 14:04.808
Just pick one. What does it matter?

14:04.833 --> 14:06.365
It's the same thing either way.
It's chicken.

14:06.390 --> 14:07.647
It's like Democrats or Republicans.

14:07.672 --> 14:09.556
Democrats and Republicans
are not the same thing.

14:09.581 --> 14:12.584
Yeah, they are. Okay, guys, maybe
we shouldn't talk about politics?

14:12.609 --> 14:15.153
Either way, it's the upper class
that's ruling everything.

14:15.178 --> 14:16.483
I mean, if you don't think

14:16.508 --> 14:18.323
that we're living in an oligarchy,

14:18.348 --> 14:19.625
you need to wake up.

14:19.650 --> 14:22.122
So which way do you vote?
Oh, I don't vote.

14:22.523 --> 14:24.454
What?!

14:31.612 --> 14:34.200
So, you've never voted, like, ever?

14:34.225 --> 14:36.466
- Uh, no.
- Not even for Obama?

14:36.491 --> 14:39.312
Oh, my God. This is bonkers.

14:39.337 --> 14:40.553
You're bonkers! This is crazy!

14:40.578 --> 14:42.475
I really don't see
what the big deal is.

14:42.500 --> 14:43.439
Clearly you don't.

14:43.464 --> 14:45.038
Okay, even if the whole system

14:45.063 --> 14:46.611
wasn't rigged for the banks...

14:46.636 --> 14:48.612
Which it is... It's just one vote.

14:48.637 --> 14:50.052
It doesn't make a
difference either way.

14:50.077 --> 14:51.945
Every vote matters. That's the
whole point of democracy.

14:51.970 --> 14:53.506
Okay. I have a question for you.

14:53.531 --> 14:56.537
- Um, is it soft?
- Is what soft?

14:56.562 --> 14:59.100
The wool that's been
pulled over your eyes!

14:59.125 --> 15:00.457
- Ohh!
- Ohh!

15:00.482 --> 15:03.021
Okay, okay. I vote we
change the subject.

15:03.046 --> 15:05.249
Right, get it? So, uh, chicken, huh?

15:05.274 --> 15:06.294
- I love...
- Shh!

15:06.319 --> 15:07.675
What about local elections?

15:07.700 --> 15:10.511
Your one vote could decide
where your local taxes go.

15:10.536 --> 15:13.269
Have you thought about that,
or are you too selfish?

15:13.294 --> 15:15.581
Wrong again. I don't pay local taxes.

15:15.606 --> 15:17.262
Yes, you do. We all do.

15:17.287 --> 15:19.294
Not if you live in a van.

15:23.913 --> 15:26.032
You live in a van?

15:26.518 --> 15:28.602
Yeah, I do, okay?

15:28.627 --> 15:30.871
I was traveling so much
as a flight attendant,

15:30.896 --> 15:32.186
it's like, why am I shelling out

15:32.211 --> 15:33.720
for an apartment that I'm never in?

15:33.745 --> 15:37.501
With the van, I save
money on taxes and rent,

15:37.526 --> 15:40.078
and I get to shower at the airline gym.

15:40.103 --> 15:42.600
- Gross.
- Dude. You're homeless?

15:42.625 --> 15:44.625
No, I am a citizen of the world.

15:44.650 --> 15:46.683
Who doesn't vote and sleeps in a car.

15:46.708 --> 15:48.098
It's a van!

15:48.123 --> 15:50.553
This is just classic
white male privilege.

15:50.578 --> 15:53.658
Well, how about that classic
white meat chicken, right?

15:53.683 --> 15:55.886
Okay, if anyone here is
privileged, it's you.

15:55.911 --> 15:57.842
And don't get all high
and mighty with me

15:57.867 --> 16:00.008
just 'cause you voted
for "Obama bin Laden."

16:00.033 --> 16:00.991
- What?!
- Hello!

16:01.016 --> 16:02.750
Excuse me, what are you talking about?

16:02.775 --> 16:04.079
Oh, crack a book.

16:04.104 --> 16:05.924
You know what? I thought
you were a good guy.

16:05.949 --> 16:07.595
But, apparently, that's
just Island Owen,

16:07.620 --> 16:11.496
because the real Owen from back
home is a friggin' dirtbag.

16:11.521 --> 16:13.571
Well, maybe you shouldn't
be with any Owen.

16:13.596 --> 16:15.528
- Fine by me!
- Fine by me!

16:22.227 --> 16:25.982
I can't believe this.

16:26.007 --> 16:27.998
I'm just glad I've got
somebody to talk to.

16:28.023 --> 16:30.592
I hear that, and I hear you.

16:32.545 --> 16:35.608
You know, I really thought that
Todd douche was gonna kill you.

16:36.039 --> 16:37.944
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

16:37.969 --> 16:39.408
I mean, he's not, like,
the biggest guy,

16:39.433 --> 16:41.101
but his arms are pretty buffed.

16:41.126 --> 16:44.537
If he really got to the
point of raging out, yikes.

16:45.737 --> 16:47.537
But whatever. Who cares about him?

16:47.562 --> 16:48.767
- Right.
- Right?

16:48.792 --> 16:51.219
- Who cares?
- Mm-hmm.

16:59.866 --> 17:01.598
Hey, man.

17:01.623 --> 17:05.102
People are starting to
turn on each other.

17:05.127 --> 17:06.848
You know what I think they need?

17:07.492 --> 17:09.980
Classic Owen speech... Rally
the troops, you know?

17:10.005 --> 17:11.476
You know what?

17:11.501 --> 17:14.111
I am done trying to lead these people.

17:14.136 --> 17:16.189
If you want a speech,
Danny, you make it.

17:21.507 --> 17:23.267
Um.

17:23.303 --> 17:24.766
Hi, everyone.

17:24.790 --> 17:26.624
Can I get your attention, please?

17:29.338 --> 17:31.266
Thank you.

17:32.184 --> 17:33.984
I know we're all a bit freaked out

17:34.009 --> 17:38.217
with the whole Hunt
hanging over our heads,

17:39.145 --> 17:42.466
but we got to remember
that we are family,

17:42.949 --> 17:46.318
and every family has its low moments,

17:46.753 --> 17:50.894
whether that's your
parents getting divorced

17:51.827 --> 17:55.336
or your sister blowing up your dad

17:55.361 --> 17:56.829
with a golf cart.

17:58.364 --> 18:02.700
The point is, instead of
dwelling on the lows,

18:02.702 --> 18:05.205
I'd rather focus on the highs.

18:05.580 --> 18:10.045
Like the fact that we've all
made it this far together!

18:10.888 --> 18:13.355
You know, when we
landed on this island,

18:13.380 --> 18:15.259
I had a vision...

18:15.441 --> 18:18.473
of all of us in the future.

18:19.296 --> 18:22.430
It was like the end of one of
those "Fast & Furious" movies

18:22.455 --> 18:25.323
where you can tell that the
crew has been through some shit

18:25.348 --> 18:29.520
but they came out of it together
because they are a family.

18:29.553 --> 18:32.080
Yeah, but that's just a movie.

18:33.151 --> 18:34.684
And we're not a family.

18:34.709 --> 18:36.270
We're just a bunch of strangers

18:36.295 --> 18:39.113
who had the shitty luck of
getting on the same plane.

18:39.683 --> 18:41.474
Maybe we were strangers, but...

18:41.499 --> 18:43.685
If we're not strangers,
what's my last name?

18:45.533 --> 18:47.205
Uhh.

18:47.448 --> 18:49.414
Owen...

18:50.042 --> 18:51.708
Wilson?

18:51.893 --> 18:54.694
You think that my name is Owen Wilson,

18:54.719 --> 18:56.169
like the movie star?

18:56.194 --> 18:58.461
- Wahlberg?
- Wahlburger.

18:58.486 --> 19:00.086
Wallbanger.

19:00.111 --> 19:01.643
Owen Harvey Wallbanger.

19:01.668 --> 19:06.038
Hold up. Does anyone know
any of our last names?

19:09.595 --> 19:11.148
See?

19:11.697 --> 19:13.249
We're no one to each other.

19:17.803 --> 19:20.313
Dinner is served.

19:21.343 --> 19:23.277
We never settled on anything.

19:23.302 --> 19:24.609
I did.

19:25.412 --> 19:27.245
And it's oatmeal and trout.

19:27.270 --> 19:28.593
Are you serious?

19:28.618 --> 19:29.526
- Ugh!
- Ugh!

19:29.551 --> 19:30.970
- What?
- Oatmeal and trout?

19:30.995 --> 19:33.705
You had her make oatmeal
and trout for all of us?

19:33.730 --> 19:36.266
Well, you heard Owen. We're strangers.

19:36.291 --> 19:38.129
So screw you people.

19:38.227 --> 19:39.764
Every man for himself.

19:39.789 --> 19:41.867
- The hell is wrong with you?
- Nobody wants that!

19:44.269 --> 19:47.319
- It's all we've got!
- It's fine. Okay.
