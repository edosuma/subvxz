01:43:47.873 --> 01:43:49.919
I don't...

01:43:50.093 --> 01:43:52.574
What was the food like?

01:43:52.748 --> 01:43:54.445
The food was awful.

01:43:56.230 --> 01:43:57.883
Your father's dead, pal.

01:43:58.057 --> 01:43:59.537
I know.

01:43:59.711 --> 01:44:01.060
How do you know?

01:44:01.235 --> 01:44:02.453
Kids told me.

01:44:02.627 --> 01:44:04.586
They showed it to me
in the paper.

01:44:08.111 --> 01:44:09.721
What did the papers say?

01:44:09.895 --> 01:44:13.943
That he died a while ago.
About me, I mean.

01:44:14.117 --> 01:44:16.075
What did it say about me?

01:44:17.642 --> 01:44:18.948
It's okay.

01:44:20.036 --> 01:44:21.864
Go ahead.

01:44:22.038 --> 01:44:26.390
It said you were arrested.
Mm. Why was I arrested?

01:44:26.564 --> 01:44:29.219
It said you didn't do
what you were supposed to do.

01:44:34.703 --> 01:44:36.313
Look.

01:44:36.487 --> 01:44:38.010
What was done
and what was not done

01:44:38.184 --> 01:44:41.362
was done or not done for
a very good, very real reason.

01:44:41.536 --> 01:44:43.494
All right?
All right.

01:44:43.668 --> 01:44:46.845
And what you have to understand
is that I was not wrong.

01:44:48.934 --> 01:44:50.762
If this is going to work...

01:44:52.242 --> 01:44:53.939
you and me, I mean,

01:44:54.113 --> 01:44:57.203
you're going to have to take
my word for that. All right?

01:44:57.378 --> 01:44:58.292
Okay?

01:45:02.121 --> 01:45:03.340
Okay.

01:45:05.560 --> 01:45:08.954
[ENGINE STARTS]
What was jail like?

01:45:09.128 --> 01:45:11.740
Not really very much fun.

01:45:11.914 --> 01:45:13.785
What was the food like?

01:45:16.701 --> 01:45:18.224
You're getting it.

01:45:20.139 --> 01:45:22.359
Now, let's have that tie.

01:45:22.533 --> 01:45:24.448
Why?
Oh, it's-- Ugh.
