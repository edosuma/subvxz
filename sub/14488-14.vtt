You're all terrible

01:05.400 --> 01:07.527
I resent that.

01:12.657 --> 01:15.076
Wait, I found a loophole
in the mortgage.

01:15.159 --> 01:18.329
If we actually pay it,
we can keep the building.

Remember Fry's idea
to offer free delivery?

If you want to
save this company,

01:58.244 --> 02:00.538
We should become
a commercial airline.

here is a refrigerator.

If we could supercharge her
Freon with a gas compressor,

12:14.360 --> 12:16.987
we might survive the heat
and make it to the cave.

Okay, so we were hot.
I stole Amana's Freon coil

12:59.405 --> 13:01.699

Bender's ass and build a oooler.
