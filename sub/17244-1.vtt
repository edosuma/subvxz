WEBVTT

01:53.947 --> 01:55.149
( gasps )

01:55.816 --> 01:56.884
Beethoven!

01:58.419 --> 02:00.721
- ( burps )
- Come here.

02:00.754 --> 02:03.557
I'm sorry. Beethoven,
what's the matter?

02:03.591 --> 02:05.193
My lunch wasn't enough?

02:10.898 --> 02:13.167
Oh look,
Beethoven.

02:13.201 --> 02:15.403
I guess this
is Quicksilver,

02:15.436 --> 02:16.804
which is in
the middle of--

02:16.837 --> 02:18.306
oh, what's the word?

02:18.839 --> 02:20.874
Nowhere.

02:20.908 --> 02:23.411
I sure hope they have
indoor plumbing.

02:23.444 --> 02:24.912
I know, I know,

02:24.945 --> 02:27.448
we're a long way
from home,

02:27.481 --> 02:29.417
and we've got a long month
ahead of us.

02:31.885 --> 02:34.255
What are we gonna
do all summer?

02:34.288 --> 02:35.423
There's no mall,
no movies,

02:37.391 --> 02:41.229
and we don't know anyone
except Uncle Freddy.

02:41.262 --> 02:43.197
And we haven't seen him
in, like, forever.

02:46.834 --> 02:49.603
You know what this
adds up to?

02:49.637 --> 02:51.772
- Disaster.
- ( Beethoven barks )

02:51.805 --> 02:53.974
Driver:
You watch your step now,
little lady.

02:54.007 --> 02:55.343
Have a nice day.

03:10.458 --> 03:12.960
Somebody meeting
you, hon?

03:12.993 --> 03:15.763
Um, yeah,
my uncle's supposed
to pick me up.

03:15.796 --> 03:19.300
- He should be here any minute.
- How nice.

03:19.333 --> 03:21.469
Maybe I know him.
What's his name?

03:21.502 --> 03:24.372
Freddy.
Freddy Kablinski.

03:24.405 --> 03:26.907
( laughs )
Freddy Kablinski?

03:26.940 --> 03:28.409
( laughs loudly )
Freddy!

03:32.446 --> 03:33.681
( horn blaring )

03:40.921 --> 03:42.390
( siren approaches )

03:49.430 --> 03:51.399
Sara?
Sara Newton?

03:51.432 --> 03:52.833
You're
12 minutes late.

03:55.068 --> 03:56.537
Whoa!
What happened to you?

03:57.705 --> 04:00.541
Last time I saw you,
you were a toddler.

04:00.574 --> 04:04.345
- I was six.
- Well, whatever.
Hey, listen, sorry I'm late.

04:04.378 --> 04:06.580
I was working on this baby
and I kinda lost track
of time.

04:06.614 --> 04:08.682
Here, give me
that bag.

04:08.716 --> 04:11.852
Seems like I've
got to tune it up
every third fire.

04:11.885 --> 04:13.954
Mom didn't tell me
you're a firefighter.

04:13.987 --> 04:16.357
For good reason-- I'm not.
I'm a grease monkey.

04:16.390 --> 04:18.291
A certified mechanic.

04:18.326 --> 04:19.593
Whoa!
Is that the dog?

04:21.462 --> 04:22.896
- ( barks )
- This is Beethoven.

04:25.966 --> 04:27.801
Come on, Beethoven.
Here, Beethoven, come on.

04:27.835 --> 04:30.304
Come to Freddy.
Come on and say hi. Come on.

04:30.338 --> 04:31.939
- ( barks )
- No! Whoa!

04:31.972 --> 04:34.074
Beethoven--

04:34.107 --> 04:36.444
don't lick Uncle Freddy.
You don't know
where he's been.

04:36.477 --> 04:38.979
Have you ever considered
a face lift?

04:39.012 --> 04:41.815
Maybe just shorten these
a little bit? A little tuck?

04:41.849 --> 04:45.919
- Get this wolfhound off me.
- He's a Saint Bernard.

04:45.953 --> 04:49.022
- The drool, please!
Get him off! Come on!
- Come on, Beethoven.

04:51.625 --> 04:55.363
So, Sara, kicked out
of camp, huh?
( chuckles )

04:55.396 --> 04:56.964
Way to go,
I got kicked out
of college twice.

04:56.997 --> 04:58.999
I wasn't
kicked out.

04:59.032 --> 05:01.502
They asked me
to leave.

05:01.535 --> 05:04.438
Oh, excuse me.
Oh, yeah, right,
"asked to leave."

05:04.472 --> 05:07.107
And just exactly
why were you
asked to leave?

05:07.140 --> 05:09.610
They wanted me to use
an outhouse.

05:09.643 --> 05:11.044
Do you know what that is?

05:12.880 --> 05:14.648
A bathroom that's
on the outside?

05:14.682 --> 05:18.452
It's a toilet seat
on a hole in the ground.

05:18.486 --> 05:21.722
So you got sentenced to 30 days
hard time at Camp Freddy, huh?

05:21.755 --> 05:23.691
Uncle Freddy,
do you need glasses?

05:24.725 --> 05:25.793
( groans )

05:28.662 --> 05:30.898
Freddy:
And welcome
to "Camp Freddy."

05:30.931 --> 05:33.434
We got a whole month
together

05:33.467 --> 05:35.135
before your parents
get back from Hawaii.

05:35.168 --> 05:36.904
Sara:
They're in the Bahamas.

05:36.937 --> 05:39.339
Freddy:
Palm trees and coconuts,
close enough.

05:41.842 --> 05:43.911
It's okay, Beethoven,
you can go on in.

05:43.944 --> 05:45.646
Remember to wipe
your feet.

05:48.749 --> 05:50.918
Come on. Grab the mail
for me, would you?

05:50.951 --> 05:51.852
Sure.

05:54.555 --> 05:56.089
Huh? Uncle Freddy,
I didn't do it.

05:58.091 --> 06:00.528
Oh, it's okay.
Go on inside.

06:00.561 --> 06:02.362
Somebody clipped
my mailbox again.

06:03.664 --> 06:06.534
What kind of idiot
can't see a mailbox?

06:06.567 --> 06:08.602
I've got to call
the sheriff about this.

06:10.738 --> 06:12.773
I'd throw his butt in jail
is what I'd do.

06:14.842 --> 06:15.909
Beethoven?

06:16.844 --> 06:17.811
Oh, no!

06:19.012 --> 06:21.114
What have you done?

06:21.148 --> 06:23.016
You've only been here
30 seconds

06:23.050 --> 06:25.018
and you've already
trashed the place!

06:25.653 --> 06:26.720
Beethoven!

06:31.058 --> 06:32.893
We're gonna get
kicked out of here too.

06:32.926 --> 06:33.961
( burps )

06:39.767 --> 06:42.135
Sorry about the kitchen.

06:42.169 --> 06:46.073
- Is something wrong?
- Well, it's kind of a mess.

06:46.106 --> 06:49.209
Oh, yeah, I'm sorry about that,
I should have cleaned up
before you got here.

06:49.242 --> 06:51.445
You mean, you did this,
not Beethoven?

06:54.882 --> 06:57.818
Why, is he a messy dog
or something?

06:57.851 --> 06:59.620
It depends on what
you call messy.

07:00.521 --> 07:02.155
Hey, no big deal.

07:02.189 --> 07:04.658
I'll take care of this.
Just wait here one sec.

07:07.895 --> 07:09.597
Boy, can't wait
to see my room.

07:12.866 --> 07:14.535
Okay, Sara, grab a wall.

07:16.136 --> 07:17.705
Sara:
Oh! Uncle Freddy.

07:18.071 --> 07:18.939
Oh!

07:20.908 --> 07:23.176
I put the linoleum in
so I could do this.

07:23.210 --> 07:25.112
Sara:
Watch out, Beethoven!

07:25.145 --> 07:28.248
This is a side benefit,
I guess, for tuning up
that fire truck.

07:28.281 --> 07:30.117
Uncle Freddy, I already
took a shower!

07:32.520 --> 07:35.489
- Your mom never
thought of this.
- Beethoven, stay back!

07:35.523 --> 07:37.891
Watch out, Beethoven.

07:37.925 --> 07:40.093
And this is how
I do my counters.

07:40.127 --> 07:41.228
Sara:
Beethoven!

07:41.261 --> 07:43.797
Pretty clean, huh?

07:43.831 --> 07:46.233
So, what do you
usually have
for breakfast at home?

07:47.668 --> 07:50.671
Mom says as far
as nutrition
is concerned,

07:50.704 --> 07:52.806
breakfast is the most
important meal of the day.

07:52.840 --> 07:54.908
You've got
to have milk,

07:54.942 --> 07:56.544
and fruit, and protein.

07:58.278 --> 07:59.847
Okay, coming right up.

08:05.018 --> 08:05.986
( barks )

08:08.956 --> 08:10.123
There you go.

08:12.159 --> 08:13.193
This is breakfast?

08:15.596 --> 08:17.998
Fruit, milk, and protein--
just like you asked for.

08:20.701 --> 08:22.603
Uncle Freddy,
it's a banana split.

08:25.272 --> 08:27.741
I think I'll have some
of your bran flakes,
if I may.

08:29.810 --> 08:31.244
Bran flakes--
okay, sure.

08:36.884 --> 08:39.720
I don't see
an expiration date on this,
so it should be okay.

08:46.193 --> 08:47.160
Say when.

08:48.862 --> 08:49.730
When.

08:59.039 --> 09:01.141
It's a shame to see
all that ice cream
go to waste.

09:07.114 --> 09:08.148
Freddy: Mmm.

09:12.686 --> 09:14.655
( laughing )

09:14.688 --> 09:17.224
Hey, look at this.
Who needs a maid?

09:17.257 --> 09:20.594
That floor will never be safe
for trash again.

09:20.628 --> 09:22.663
I should have got a dog
a long time ago.

09:32.372 --> 09:35.042
Freddy:
That's it, that's it, good.

09:35.075 --> 09:36.944
A little to the left,
a little to the left.

09:36.977 --> 09:39.980
Good. Steady, steady.

09:40.013 --> 09:42.015
- Sara: Watch out, Beethoven.
- Freddy: Whoa!

09:44.184 --> 09:46.787
Ahh!
You are a natural.

09:46.820 --> 09:49.256
Don't you have
any work to do?

09:49.289 --> 09:51.959
Well, the great thing
about being your own boss is,

09:51.992 --> 09:53.861
nobody tells you
when to come in,

09:53.894 --> 09:55.829
you can have lunch
whenever you like,

09:55.863 --> 09:58.331
and, best of all,

09:58.365 --> 10:00.834
you can have
creeper races
whenever you want.

10:00.868 --> 10:03.003
- Come on, give it a try.
- I don't know.

10:04.738 --> 10:07.374
Come on, it'll be
fun, try it.

10:07.407 --> 10:10.110
Um... no thanks,
it looks dangerous.

10:10.143 --> 10:12.412
All right,
you know what?

10:12.445 --> 10:14.782
Sometimes you've
got to just jump in
without your floaties.

10:14.815 --> 10:15.749
Watch.

10:18.819 --> 10:21.321
- Watch it, Uncle Freddy!
- ( barking )

10:21.354 --> 10:22.823
Sara: Oh, watch out!

10:26.894 --> 10:28.295
- Freddy!
- Boy: Strike!

10:28.328 --> 10:30.297
( clapping )
I scored that jump a 10.

10:32.299 --> 10:35.335
- Hey, yeah it was, wasn't it?
- Awesome.

10:35.368 --> 10:38.438
- Uncle Freddy are you okay?
- You guys wanna hang out,
or something?

10:38.471 --> 10:41.141
No, I can't. I gotta
put shocks on that
Caddy over there.

10:41.174 --> 10:42.910
But you guys
should definitely
hang out.

10:42.943 --> 10:45.879
- Hi, I'm Garrett.
- Hi, I'm Sara.

10:45.913 --> 10:49.082
You're very tall
for an eight-year-old.

10:49.116 --> 10:51.885
- Eight-year-old?
- Okay, so I was off
a coupla years?

10:51.919 --> 10:54.054
- ( Beethoven growls )
- Hey, is that your dog?

10:54.087 --> 10:57.090
Yeah,
this is Beethoven.

10:57.124 --> 11:00.060
You know, Saint Bernards
are known for their
psychic abilities.

11:00.093 --> 11:01.862
Well, he is
pretty smart.

11:01.895 --> 11:03.997
Aren't you boy?

11:04.031 --> 11:06.166
Hey, kids, you wanna see
something funny?

11:08.201 --> 11:09.837
- ( burps )
- ( both laugh )

11:10.938 --> 11:12.239
Not that.
Watch this.

11:14.007 --> 11:15.943
- Beethoven sit.
- ( can crumples )

11:18.478 --> 11:20.914
Now does that dog
got style or what?

11:20.948 --> 11:24.151
- ( barks )
- Hey, wait, I got an idea.

11:24.184 --> 11:26.453
Why don't you
two kids go grab
some lunch, huh?

11:26.486 --> 11:28.922
Now, Garrett,
you can take
Sara into town

11:28.956 --> 11:31.224
and show her
the sights, okay?

11:31.258 --> 11:33.761
- We have sights?
- I mean, you want a free lunch,
or what?

11:33.794 --> 11:36.229
- ( Beethoven groans )
- Yeah.

11:36.263 --> 11:38.899
I don't think Mom
would want me to go
without you.

11:38.932 --> 11:40.433
Especially
with a stranger.

11:44.004 --> 11:46.373
He may be strange,
but he's not
a stranger, okay?

11:46.406 --> 11:48.776
He's the smartest
kid in town.

11:48.809 --> 11:51.411
- Now go have a good time.
I'll take care of things here.
- Come on, let's go.

11:51.444 --> 11:54.782
- Stay with him, Beethoven.
- I'll stay with Beethoven.

11:54.815 --> 11:57.250
He can help me fix the Caddy,
right Beethoven?

11:57.284 --> 11:59.252
- Oh, you like GM products?
- ( barks )

11:59.286 --> 12:01.488
Quicksilver, huh?

12:01.521 --> 12:03.857
Guess this used to be
a silver mining town.

12:03.891 --> 12:05.759
Um, not really.
Mercury, actually.

12:06.526 --> 12:09.196
- Really?
- Yeah.

12:09.229 --> 12:12.032
It was a surprise
to the miners who
came out here, too.

12:12.065 --> 12:14.902
They were looking
for gold but hit
mercury ore instead.

12:14.935 --> 12:18.271
Quicksilver is
slang for mercury.
You knew that right?

12:18.305 --> 12:19.272
Uh, makes
perfect sense.

12:21.208 --> 12:23.543
But it turns out
mercury's pretty
dangerous.

12:23.576 --> 12:26.213
- It affects the brain's
neural function.
- Like how?

12:26.246 --> 12:27.314
You'll see.

12:30.951 --> 12:32.385
Hello, Owen.
How's it going?

12:34.021 --> 12:35.088
It's dry, too dry.

12:38.091 --> 12:41.194
- Mercury, huh?
- That's Owen Tuttle,
all right.

12:41.228 --> 12:43.496
He thinks
the polar ice caps
are gonna melt

12:43.530 --> 12:45.332
and we'll
have to learn
to live underwater.

12:45.365 --> 12:47.234
He goes to the lake
every day to practice.

12:47.267 --> 12:48.869
Hey, Garrett!
Come in here!

12:50.003 --> 12:52.139
Morning, Phil.

12:52.172 --> 12:55.308
That's Phil Dobson.
He loves gambling,
but always loses.

12:55.342 --> 12:57.110
He owes everyone
in town money.

12:59.112 --> 13:01.314
You want to play
some poker?

13:01.348 --> 13:04.284
Mr. Dobson, Your wife said
I wasn't allowed to play
with you anymore.

13:04.317 --> 13:06.119
She doesn't have to know.
Let me try and win

13:06.153 --> 13:09.089
my computer back from you, okay?
I need it for inventory.

13:09.122 --> 13:11.391
- I promised your wife
I wouldn't play with you.
- That's so unfair.

13:11.424 --> 13:13.526
Hey, what about you?
You're not a local, are you?

13:13.560 --> 13:15.595
You like to gamble?
What's your game?

13:15.628 --> 13:17.530
- No, I don't gamble.
- I'll play anything--

13:17.564 --> 13:20.133
rummy, blackjack,
war, go fish.

13:20.167 --> 13:22.369
I just like a game.
I'll play you for that blender.

13:22.402 --> 13:25.505
- I don't need a blender.
- How about this nice
electric toothbrush?

13:25.538 --> 13:27.474
Okay, I'll play you
one game of Candyland

13:27.507 --> 13:30.143
- for this nice
electric toothbrush.
- No, thanks. Bye!

13:34.547 --> 13:35.582
Uh... hi.

13:37.250 --> 13:38.451
Man:
Never saw her before.

13:38.485 --> 13:40.320
- You?
- Nope. She's not local.

13:42.055 --> 13:45.592
Dresses kind of funny.
Big city, I think.

13:45.625 --> 13:48.161
That's Freddy's niece,
isn't it? She'll come around.

13:48.195 --> 13:50.430
- Yeah, okay. See you later.
- She will.

13:50.463 --> 13:52.032
Phil:
Talk to her, huh?

13:52.065 --> 13:54.067
This town is going
to the dogs.

13:54.101 --> 13:55.936
Getting too uptown
for my likings.

13:59.639 --> 14:02.642
That's the Carter family.
They're just plain weird.

14:02.675 --> 14:04.878
- ( Beethoven barks )
- ( car horn honks )

14:07.080 --> 14:10.183
- Hey, get in, get in!
It's an emergency!
- Where are we going?

14:10.217 --> 14:12.319
Pete called-- the fish
are biting. Come on.

14:14.354 --> 14:15.889
Freddy:
Hey, feel those
new shocks.

14:15.923 --> 14:18.158
It rides like
butter, huh?

14:18.191 --> 14:20.961
Sara:
Uncle Freddy, don't people mind
you borrowing their cars?

14:20.994 --> 14:24.131
Freddy:
I like to think of it
as more of a test drive.

14:24.164 --> 14:25.966
Sara:
Where I come from
it's called "stealing."

14:25.999 --> 14:28.268
Freddy:
Ha-ha, very funny.

14:28.301 --> 14:31.972
- All right, kids,
we're here. Everybody out.
- ( car backfires )

14:32.005 --> 14:34.574
- Follow the leader
and watch your step.
- For what?

14:34.607 --> 14:37.310
- Rattlesnakes and mine shafts.
- Garrett: And ghosts.

14:37.344 --> 14:39.112
( scoffs )
Right.

14:39.146 --> 14:41.448
Hey, everybody knows
these woods are haunted.

14:41.481 --> 14:44.918
Come on, nobody
believes in ghosts.

14:44.952 --> 14:48.121
Freddy:
Oh, everybody knows there's
ghosts out here.

14:48.155 --> 14:51.091
At night, you can hear them
whistling in the mine shafts.

14:51.124 --> 14:53.593
- Whoo-hoo-hoo!
- Uncle Freddy?

14:53.626 --> 14:57.064
- Hmm?
- I think I'm gonna puke.

14:57.097 --> 14:59.599
It's just chicken liver.
Look, it appeals to Beethoven.

15:01.434 --> 15:03.536
Everything appeals
to Beethoven

15:03.570 --> 15:05.672
- even toilet water.
- Whoa!

15:05.705 --> 15:08.075
- Got a bite!
- All right, reel it in.

15:08.108 --> 15:10.477
Is that a fish?

15:10.510 --> 15:12.112
- Whoa.
- I think I've got a big one!

15:12.145 --> 15:13.646
- ( barks )
- Easy does it!

15:13.680 --> 15:16.950
All right, you've got it
Garrett! Don't let it go!

15:16.984 --> 15:19.019
Freddy:
All right,
we got dinner tonight!

15:19.052 --> 15:21.221
- Look at that baby!
- Ee-yew!

15:21.254 --> 15:24.491
- Get it away from me.
- Look at that! Is that
a dandy or what?

15:24.524 --> 15:26.659
Sara:
Ooh, there's no way
I'm eating that.

15:26.693 --> 15:28.661
- Stay away from it,
Beethoven!
- Garrett: Whoa!

15:28.695 --> 15:29.596
Ee-yew!

15:30.763 --> 15:32.465
A genuine
gronas nigrilabris.

15:33.566 --> 15:36.069
Translation:
catfish.

15:36.103 --> 15:38.105
I told you
he was the smartest kid
in Quicksilver.

15:40.607 --> 15:42.475
( screaming )
Uncle Freddy, what is it?

15:45.412 --> 15:47.614
Freddy:
Hey, It's Owen.

15:47.647 --> 15:49.349
Kids, always give
a frogman a hand.

15:52.185 --> 15:54.121
How's the weather
down there?

15:54.154 --> 15:55.355
It's wet. Too wet.

15:57.090 --> 15:58.958
Gosh, we never
would have guessed.

16:05.565 --> 16:08.068
- Is everyone
in this town crazy?
- Both: Not us!

16:11.238 --> 16:12.439
Beethoven!
Come back, boy!

16:15.308 --> 16:18.011
Oh, he's probably off
chasing a rabbit.
Don't worry about it.

16:18.045 --> 16:19.746
Or maybe
he's chasing a ghost?

16:19.779 --> 16:21.548
Yeah, I'll believe it
when I see it.

16:33.060 --> 16:35.028
Garrett:
My grandfather saw
the ghost himself

16:35.062 --> 16:37.030
when he was a kid.

16:37.064 --> 16:39.599
He and his buddies
were camping by the lake

16:39.632 --> 16:41.601
when they came
right at them.

16:41.634 --> 16:44.504
They left so fast,
they forgot the tent.

16:44.537 --> 16:47.074
And when they came back later
it was all shredded up.

16:48.208 --> 16:49.476
Oh, stop it, Garrett.

16:51.144 --> 16:53.213
There's no such thing
as ghosts.

16:53.246 --> 16:55.382
You know, Sara,
sometimes spirits get trapped

16:55.415 --> 16:57.550
in this world
and can't find their way out.

16:57.584 --> 17:01.054
Scientists,
with all their gobbledygook,

17:01.088 --> 17:02.822
they just can't figure
it out either.

17:02.855 --> 17:04.156
( rustling )

17:06.559 --> 17:09.462
- Sara: What was that?
- Freddy: It's Beethoven!

17:09.496 --> 17:13.566
- Freddy: Come here!
Here, boy! Come here!
- Sara: What's he got?

17:13.599 --> 17:16.069
Freddy:
Hey, you gotta
love that dog.

17:16.103 --> 17:17.837
He goes into the woods
and comes back with money!

17:17.869 --> 17:21.407
Anymore where
that came from, boy?

17:21.441 --> 17:24.444
- Can I keep it?
- Yeah, I don't see
why not. It looks old.

17:24.477 --> 17:26.213
Hey, go get us all some
more money, Beethoven.

17:26.246 --> 17:27.814
- Yeah!
- Buckets of it!

17:27.847 --> 17:29.116
- Right?
- Yeah!

17:29.516 --> 17:30.417
Yeah!

17:36.423 --> 17:38.258
- ( toilet flushes )
- ( water running )

17:41.594 --> 17:43.230
- ( hammering )
- ( pipes clanging )

17:50.570 --> 17:51.638
( knocking )

17:55.708 --> 17:57.810
Oh, yeah,
I forgot to mention,

17:57.844 --> 18:01.414
- the bathroom's upstairs.
- Yeah, we heard.

18:01.448 --> 18:03.650
Well, good night.
Don't let the bedbugs bite.

18:05.452 --> 18:06.719
- Uh, Uncle Freddy?
- Yeah?

18:08.688 --> 18:11.124
You don't really have
bedbugs, do you?

18:11.158 --> 18:12.392
No, not anymore.

18:24.837 --> 18:27.507
- Beethoven, this is
gonna be a long month.
- ( barks )

18:36.349 --> 18:38.318
So, I decided at that point
to give up

18:39.386 --> 18:41.288
on a career
with the NBA,

18:41.321 --> 18:43.323
and then I stopped eating
for height

18:43.356 --> 18:45.124
and started eating
for pure girth.

18:46.759 --> 18:48.495
Give me the seven-eights,
would ya?

18:50.297 --> 18:51.264
Thanks.

18:52.665 --> 18:54.767
You know, I think I'm gonna
save a lot of money

18:54.801 --> 18:56.769
on lubrication
with you around here.

18:56.803 --> 18:58.271
( tires screeching )

19:00.973 --> 19:02.409
Three, two, one...

19:03.643 --> 19:06.813
- ( siren wails )
- Right on cue.

19:06.846 --> 19:09.649
That, Beethoven, is the number
one moneymaker in this town:

19:11.518 --> 19:13.386
the speed trap
on Quicksilver Drive.

19:16.323 --> 19:18.858
Out-of-towners think they can
just blast through here
at any speed.

19:18.891 --> 19:20.593
And then they meet
the sheriff.

19:30.437 --> 19:33.373
Nine times out of 10
some yokel's at the wheel

19:33.406 --> 19:35.308
and he'll think
he can handle her
just 'cause she's a woman.

19:35.342 --> 19:36.543
Perfect.
She's a chick.

19:41.381 --> 19:42.949
License
and registration.

19:42.982 --> 19:45.785
Darlin',
what did I do wrong?

19:45.818 --> 19:47.420
It's Sheriff Dempsey.
License?

20:00.032 --> 20:02.602
Well, you gotta hope
that he doesn't start out
by calling her "honey."

20:02.635 --> 20:04.371
Honey,
we can work this out!

20:04.404 --> 20:05.805
Sweet thing like you...

20:07.340 --> 20:09.542
Ow! Ow!
Ow! Ow!

20:09.576 --> 20:11.244
Yes! It's a takedown!
Oh, yeah!

20:11.278 --> 20:12.579
- ( laughs )
- ( barks )

20:13.846 --> 20:15.915
Ohhh!

20:15.948 --> 20:18.385
Don't you scratch
an itch until
I tell you to.

20:18.418 --> 20:21.521
Yes, sir-- ma'am!
I mean, ma'am! Oww!

20:21.554 --> 20:25.392
No, Beethoven, you do not want
to mess with the sheriff.

20:25.425 --> 20:29.596
See that right there?
That's her dad, "The Equalizer!"

20:29.629 --> 20:32.732
Yes, he was the greatest
wrestler to ever mash
a face into the mat.

20:32.765 --> 20:34.000
"The Equalizer!"

20:35.768 --> 20:37.570
Uncle Freddy?
What are you doing?

20:39.672 --> 20:41.941
Just a little wrestling
talk between the guys,

20:41.974 --> 20:43.743
me and Beethoven,
you know, sports fans.

20:43.776 --> 20:45.978
So, what's up?

20:46.012 --> 20:48.648
Um, me and Beethoven wanted
to go check out some
stores nearby.

20:48.681 --> 20:51.284
Good, fine.
Well, have fun.

20:51.318 --> 20:53.686
- And behave yourself.
- We will.

20:53.720 --> 20:55.688
- So long, Beethoven.
- Come on, Beethoven.

20:59.359 --> 21:02.362
Come on, Beethoven.
Let's check this place out.
It looks friendly.

21:06.533 --> 21:08.568
- Get that Bigfoot out of here.
- Sorry.

21:09.869 --> 21:12.839
Come on, boy.
Come on.

21:12.872 --> 21:15.041
Oh, did that big elephant
scare you, Baby Cakes?

21:17.710 --> 21:19.679
You stay here, okay?
I won't be long.

21:23.082 --> 21:25.418
Come back here, Baby Cakes!
Listen to Mommy.

21:41.133 --> 21:43.603
You know, little girl,
this is a locals' store.

21:43.636 --> 21:46.673
And you're no local.
What are you doing
in Quicksilver?

21:46.706 --> 21:48.908
I'm visiting
my Uncle Freddy.

21:48.941 --> 21:51.511
- Freddy Kablinski?
- The grease monkey?

21:51.544 --> 21:52.812
He's a mechanic.

21:54.481 --> 21:55.748
A certified mechanic.

22:16.703 --> 22:19.071
Do you have any samples?

22:19.105 --> 22:21.140
What does
this look like,
Saks Fifth Avenue?

22:21.173 --> 22:24.944
Look, I've got surveillance
cameras all over this place.

22:24.977 --> 22:27.113
So don't even think about
stuffing your pockets.

22:32.051 --> 22:33.920
I guess I can charge
you the "local" price.

22:33.953 --> 22:35.788
- $7.41.
- ( cash register rings )

22:41.928 --> 22:44.764
What do you think,
I was born yesterday?

22:44.797 --> 22:47.033
- What?
- Oh, I see--

22:47.066 --> 22:48.735
The big-city folk are
coming to Quicksilver

22:48.768 --> 22:50.970
to make the local yokels
look silly, right?

22:52.439 --> 22:53.973
This is phony,
counterfeit...

22:55.708 --> 22:57.810
- funny money.
- Really-- I didn't know.

22:59.045 --> 23:01.147
Didn't know?
Hmm.

23:01.180 --> 23:02.815
Everyone knows
that Hamilton
is on the 10s

23:02.849 --> 23:05.051
and Andrew Jackson
is on the 20s.

23:05.084 --> 23:07.086
There it is, Andrew Jackson,
clear as day.

23:07.854 --> 23:09.021
Issued in 1920.

23:10.657 --> 23:11.824
Um-- I'm sorry!

23:13.726 --> 23:16.028
I better
be going now!

23:16.062 --> 23:17.930
I'll bring back
real money. Bye!

23:18.598 --> 23:19.499
1920?

23:23.770 --> 23:24.904
Come on, boy.

23:25.905 --> 23:27.474
Let's get out of here.

23:33.880 --> 23:36.749
So you say Alexander
Hamilton's supposed to be
on the 10, huh?

23:36.783 --> 23:38.751
Uh-uh, and Andrew Jackson's
on the 20.

23:39.819 --> 23:41.654
Hmm, well, we'll
see about that.

23:43.790 --> 23:46.893
Oh, I guess you have to have
money before you can spot
counterfeit bills.

23:46.926 --> 23:49.061
- We better go to the bank.
- Wait.

23:49.095 --> 23:51.097
- Here you go.
- Oh. Thank you, Mr. Gates.

23:53.065 --> 23:54.601
I won it
from Mr. Dobson.

23:54.634 --> 23:57.804
You know, it pains me
to admit that Evie Kling

23:57.837 --> 24:00.573
might be right about anything,
but guess what?

24:00.607 --> 24:03.510
- She is right.
- It was so humiliating.

24:03.543 --> 24:06.212
Maybe we should just
turn this into
the sheriff.

24:06.245 --> 24:08.648
I say, ignore
law enforcement.
Let's keep it.

24:10.016 --> 24:12.118
Yeah. No, no we better
go to the sheriff.

24:14.253 --> 24:17.990
As long as Beethoven
doesn't get in trouble
for passing funny money.

24:18.024 --> 24:20.927
Freddy:
Oh, I don't think they have
room for him in the big house.

24:20.960 --> 24:23.029
Come on, let's go.

24:23.062 --> 24:25.765
Radio:
Central, this is Unit Four...

24:25.798 --> 24:27.600
- Hey, Jim,
is the sheriff in?
- She's right there.

24:27.634 --> 24:28.935
Thank you. Oh, hey!

24:31.103 --> 24:33.773
Oh, hey, Freddy.
This must be your niece,
the counterfeiter.

24:33.806 --> 24:35.675
I didn't know,
honest.

24:35.708 --> 24:37.910
- Sara, this is
Sheriff Dempsey.
- Call me Julie.

24:41.981 --> 24:44.817
- Hey, hey, who's the thief?
- Sara: Beethoven!

24:44.851 --> 24:46.686
- Partners in crime, huh?
- Sorry.

24:48.187 --> 24:50.590
- He's kind of a bottomless pit.
- ( burps )

24:52.792 --> 24:56.295
You can relax, Sara.
You were paying with real money.

24:56.328 --> 24:58.497
- Well, look.
- I know, looks strange.

25:00.299 --> 25:02.268
But come here.
Come here, check this out.

25:03.636 --> 25:06.072
I did a little
web surfing.

25:06.105 --> 25:09.542
You see? There were
Andrew Jackson $10 bills.

25:09.576 --> 25:13.646
- Really?
- It says here, the first ones
rolled off the press in 1914,

25:13.680 --> 25:16.082
and they stopped
sometime in the late '20s.

25:16.115 --> 25:17.650
- Did you say 1920?
- Um-hmm.

25:18.718 --> 25:20.820
This bill
is very rare.

25:20.853 --> 25:23.155
Collectors will pay
anywhere from $50
to $200 a bill.

25:23.189 --> 25:24.591
Let me see that.

25:28.227 --> 25:30.229
Oh, yeah.
There it is right there.

25:30.262 --> 25:32.932
1920 in black
and white.

25:32.965 --> 25:34.701
- Garrett: Whoa.
- I don't get it.

25:34.734 --> 25:36.736
What's the big deal
about the 1920s
anyway?

25:38.370 --> 25:40.573
It it true?
Is it really
"Rita and Moe" money?

25:40.607 --> 25:42.341
That money
is mine.

25:42.374 --> 25:44.744
She snatched it out
of my hand after I agreed

25:44.777 --> 25:47.113
to sell her some
of my finest lip gloss.

25:47.146 --> 25:50.617
- It was in my hand,
issued in the year 1920.
- Where'd it come from?

25:52.685 --> 25:54.320
It wasn't me,
it was him, Beethoven.

25:59.025 --> 26:01.093
- Nice doggie.
- Come here to Mommy.

26:01.127 --> 26:03.696
- Oh, yes.
- Do you want to come home
with Uncle Stu?

26:09.068 --> 26:12.371
Will somebody please
tell me what's going on?

26:12.404 --> 26:15.374
Well, Sara, it's all about
the history of our fair town.

26:15.407 --> 26:18.244
Hiram Berkin's mine produced
more pure mercury

26:18.277 --> 26:20.279
than the rest of
the country put together.

26:20.312 --> 26:22.749
Millions of teeth
have been filled
and temperatures taken

26:22.782 --> 26:25.184
because of our little burg
right here.

26:25.217 --> 26:28.621
You know, the mine
was open until about
15 years ago.

26:28.655 --> 26:32.158
Then those troublemakers
from the FDA started
spreading those lies.

26:32.191 --> 26:35.327
You know it's
a medical urban myth
that mercury is poisonous.

26:35.361 --> 26:37.063
I use it all the time,
I'm fine.

26:39.766 --> 26:43.069
Oh, but our biggest
claim to fame came back in 1926.

26:43.102 --> 26:45.237
We made all
the papers then.

26:45.271 --> 26:46.973
- You know why, Sara?
- Why?

26:47.006 --> 26:48.607
Ah, come here,
I'll show you.

26:51.243 --> 26:53.379
The famous
Moe and Rita Selig.

26:53.412 --> 26:55.915
They were bank robbers
like Bonnie and Clyde.

26:55.948 --> 26:58.184
Well, not exactly
like Bonnie and Clyde.

26:58.217 --> 27:01.220
They were more
accomplished than
Bonnie and Clyde.

27:01.253 --> 27:03.322
They just never
got a movie made
about them.

27:03.355 --> 27:05.291
Rita and Moe,
"The Courteous Crooks."

27:17.770 --> 27:20.940
The Seligs were know as
The Courteous Crooks because

27:20.973 --> 27:23.275
they would always
say "please" right before
they robbed you blind.

27:23.309 --> 27:26.045
- ( laughs )
- And of course there's
the red carnation.

27:27.446 --> 27:29.849
Moe always pulled it
from his lapel

27:29.882 --> 27:31.283
and left it behind
after a heist.

27:31.317 --> 27:33.052
But they never
hurt anyone.

27:33.085 --> 27:35.287
Yeah.
They must have robbed,

27:35.321 --> 27:37.256
I don't know,
12 banks across the Midwest

27:37.289 --> 27:40.827
before the cops ever
caught up with them.
Guess where, Sara?

27:40.860 --> 27:43.696
- Quicksilver!
- Quicksilver, bingo!
That's exactly right.

27:50.302 --> 27:52.905
Cops chased them right into
Quicksilver Lake and...

27:59.011 --> 28:01.213
...they drowned.

28:01.247 --> 28:03.182
It was a black day
for Rita and Moe.

28:07.353 --> 28:11.357
- Harold: Found the car--
- Garrett: But they never
found the stolen money.

28:11.390 --> 28:14.126
Absolutely right, Garrett.
Not that everybody and his
brother didn't look for it.

28:14.160 --> 28:16.262
So you can see
why we're all
going nuts.

28:16.295 --> 28:18.464
It seems like Beethoven
has done what nobody's

28:18.497 --> 28:20.967
been able to do
in the last 80 years.

28:21.000 --> 28:24.070
Do you really think Beethoven
found some of Rita and Moe's
lost loot?

28:24.103 --> 28:27.807
What else could it be?
I mean, how many Jackson
$10 bills

28:27.840 --> 28:30.176
do think are
just lying around
in the middle of the woods?

28:30.209 --> 28:32.912
Yeah. Hey, wouldn't
it be cool

28:32.945 --> 28:34.847
if Beethoven could
find some more?

28:34.881 --> 28:36.849
Yeah, if he's not afraid
of ghosts.

28:38.384 --> 28:40.753
-( growls )
- Oh, come on.

28:40.787 --> 28:43.189
Oh, it's been
rumored for years,
Sara, that the ghosts

28:43.222 --> 28:45.357
of Moe and Rita
haunt those woods,

28:45.391 --> 28:47.827
protecting their money
ever since they drowned.

28:47.860 --> 28:50.096
- It's true.
- Please.

28:50.129 --> 28:53.165
I never believed it
myself, but I gotta
tell you something...

28:53.199 --> 28:56.002
something weird happened to me
out there a few years ago.

28:56.035 --> 28:59.305
I was squirrel hunting
in the woods,

28:59.338 --> 29:02.975
and all of a sudden I knew
that somebody was following me.

29:03.009 --> 29:05.511
And here it was,
the middle of the summer,

29:05.544 --> 29:07.847
and yet this icy wind
blew right through me.

29:10.516 --> 29:11.984
Even my dog started
howling.

29:14.520 --> 29:16.388
But there
was nobody there.

29:16.422 --> 29:18.891
And it's a proven fact
that dogs howl

29:18.925 --> 29:20.993
when ghosts are around.

29:21.027 --> 29:24.330
Dogs also howl
at fire engines.

29:24.363 --> 29:27.399
Well, Harold, we really enjoyed
this little walk through
history, but...

29:27.433 --> 29:29.501
we don't want to take up any
more of your valuable time.

29:29.535 --> 29:31.904
Come on, kids, let's go.

29:31.938 --> 29:34.106
- Thanks a lot, Harold.
- Bye.

29:34.140 --> 29:36.042
- Bye, Mr. Herman.
- Come back anytime.

29:36.075 --> 29:37.543
You too, big fella.

29:37.576 --> 29:39.178
My door is always open.

30:02.601 --> 30:05.404
Sara:
Hurry, let me
out of here.

30:05.437 --> 30:07.406
Ride's over,
you survived.

30:07.439 --> 30:09.541
Next time,
I get the front, okay?

30:09.575 --> 30:12.211
It's just as
creepy up front.

30:12.244 --> 30:14.914
You think it's creepy now,
you should have seen it
when they brought it in.

30:14.947 --> 30:15.915
Come on.

30:19.218 --> 30:22.421
Okay, Beethoven, you get
a good whiff of this 10 spot

30:22.454 --> 30:25.324
and you lead me
to its little brothers
and sisters. Okay, go!

30:26.658 --> 30:29.095
Sara:
Why are we going
at night again?

30:29.128 --> 30:31.563
Freddy:
So no one will see us
looking for the money.

30:31.597 --> 30:34.133
- He's gonna do it.
- He's better than
a lottery ticket.

30:34.166 --> 30:36.468
- Attaboy!
- Freddy: Come on, boy.
Use your smeller, feller.

30:38.670 --> 30:40.539
- ( growling )
- What is it, boy?

30:42.208 --> 30:43.910
Sara:
What's that?

30:43.943 --> 30:46.612
I don't like it,
Uncle Freddy.

30:46.645 --> 30:48.014
Probably just
a possum.

30:51.918 --> 30:53.285
Sara:
That's no possum.

30:53.319 --> 30:54.486
- Stu?
- Freddy?

30:56.555 --> 31:00.092
What are you doing
out here in the middle
of the night?

31:00.126 --> 31:01.928
Oh, just, uh...
enjoying the walk.

31:03.262 --> 31:06.498
With a metal
detector?

31:06.532 --> 31:09.135
Well, you'd be surprised some
of the things you can
find in woods

31:09.168 --> 31:11.037
and tonight I hit
the jackpot.

31:11.070 --> 31:13.039
How about this fork?

31:13.072 --> 31:16.042
You know, you can never,
ever have enough forks.

31:16.075 --> 31:17.676
One buck
and it's yours.

31:17.709 --> 31:20.046
The weird thing is,
I happen to have

31:20.079 --> 31:21.647
more forks than I need
right now, so,

31:21.680 --> 31:23.315
you have a nice
night, okay?

31:24.583 --> 31:26.118
Oh, listen, Freddy--

31:27.719 --> 31:30.056
- I was never here.
- You can count on that.

31:31.958 --> 31:34.493
He is not out here
looking for silverware.

31:34.526 --> 31:36.428
I got a bad feeling
about this, kids.

31:36.462 --> 31:38.630
Beethoven--

31:38.664 --> 31:41.200
- take us to the dough!
- ( barks )

31:41.233 --> 31:44.270
- All right.
- Come on, boy.

31:44.303 --> 31:46.973
Sara:
You don't think this is
a wild goose chase, do you?

31:47.006 --> 31:49.341
Garrett:
No, Saint Bernards
can smell a person

31:49.375 --> 31:51.010
- buried under
20 feet of snow.
- Really?

31:55.381 --> 31:57.349
( growling )

31:57.383 --> 32:00.452
- Freddy?
- Vaughan?

32:00.486 --> 32:04.056
- What are you doing out here?
- I was going to ask you
the same thing.

32:04.090 --> 32:07.393
- We're looking for money--
- Mush-mushrooms!
We're looking for mushrooms.

32:07.426 --> 32:08.660
Come on, kids.
Owen--

32:11.630 --> 32:13.199
You find anything
in the lake?

32:14.233 --> 32:15.501
Water, lots of water.

32:18.670 --> 32:20.339
The lake is mine.
Stay out of it.

32:24.043 --> 32:25.111
( growls )

32:26.545 --> 32:29.181
Who's that girl?
She's not local.

32:29.215 --> 32:31.050
- That's my niece.
- I don't trust her.

32:32.751 --> 32:34.686
- ( Beethoven barks )
- Come on, Carters.

32:37.089 --> 32:39.691
Freddy:
Well, I think this town
could use some non-locals.

32:39.725 --> 32:42.028
You know, spruce up
the gene pool a little?

32:44.696 --> 32:47.299
- Garrett: Now what?
- Freddy is that you?

32:47.333 --> 32:50.636
- Sheriff Julie?
- I heard there was some
treasure hunting going on,

32:50.669 --> 32:52.671
so I figured I'd
better make sure
nobody got hurt.

32:52.704 --> 32:55.241
You got that right.
This place is a real
madhouse tonight.

32:55.274 --> 32:57.776
Actually, I'm glad
I ran into you, Freddy.

32:57.809 --> 33:00.246
My car's been
acting up again.

33:00.279 --> 33:03.082
Twice around
the odometer,
what're you gonna do?

33:03.115 --> 33:05.617
Oh, bring it in.
I'd be happy to give
you a tune up anytime.

33:08.787 --> 33:10.622
Well-- uh, I mean,
I mean your car.

33:12.591 --> 33:15.294
( chuckles )
Right, great.

33:15.327 --> 33:17.496
I'll drop it by first
thing in the morning.
You take care now.

33:17.529 --> 33:19.031
- Sure.
- Uncle Freddy!

33:21.167 --> 33:23.035
I didn't know you were
sweet on Julie.

33:23.069 --> 33:25.504
- Am not.
- He sure is.

33:25.537 --> 33:27.206
Admit it,
you like her.

33:27.239 --> 33:29.075
- Do not.
- Do too.

33:29.108 --> 33:31.643
- Do not.
- Do too.

33:31.677 --> 33:34.413
All right, that's it,
I don't want to discuss this.
Come on, let's go home.

33:34.446 --> 33:36.182
- ( growling )
- Come on, boy.

33:37.849 --> 33:39.451
- ( howls )
- Uh, Uncle Freddy?

33:40.786 --> 33:42.088
Uncle Freddy?

33:45.791 --> 33:47.093
Sara:
What is it?

33:47.593 --> 33:48.660
( screams )

33:51.230 --> 33:54.200
- What's wrong, Sara?
- What is it?

33:54.233 --> 33:57.136
I saw them, the ghosts--
Rita and Moe-- they were
right there.

33:57.169 --> 33:58.770
- What's going on?
- Sara just saw the ghosts.

33:58.804 --> 34:00.272
They're over there!

34:01.140 --> 34:02.208
Beethoven!

34:03.275 --> 34:05.511
Beethoven, come back!

34:05.544 --> 34:07.746
- Freddy: Sara, wait!
- Sara: Somebody get him!

34:10.382 --> 34:12.618
Stay, stay here.
Stay right here.
Don't go anywhere.

34:25.697 --> 34:27.699
- Garrett: It's
Moe's carnation.
- ( howls )

34:27.733 --> 34:29.501
Julie:
Somebody's up to no good.

34:42.547 --> 34:43.748
( door creaking )

34:52.824 --> 34:53.792
( gasps )

34:54.826 --> 34:55.761
Shhh!

34:58.830 --> 35:00.098
( screams )

35:06.305 --> 35:07.573
Maybe camp wasn't
that bad.

35:11.843 --> 35:15.847
Hold on a moment,
there are no ghosts.
You said so yourself.

35:15.881 --> 35:19.218
You said there were--
"Spirits can get trapped
in this world."

35:19.251 --> 35:20.886
Well, I was kidding,
okay?

35:20.919 --> 35:23.489
A little thing
adults do for fun.

35:23.522 --> 35:25.557
Okay, maybe it wasn't
that funny.

35:25.591 --> 35:28.160
But the point is, I mean,
there could be a million reasons

35:28.194 --> 35:30.929
why that carnation was
out in the woods last night.

35:30.962 --> 35:33.499
What? Somebody dropped it
on their way to the prom?

35:35.501 --> 35:37.336
Ooh, a little teenage
attitude here, huh?

35:37.369 --> 35:39.771
It would be if I was a teenager,
but I'm only 12.

35:42.308 --> 35:45.177
Plus, I saw them,
clear as day.

35:45.211 --> 35:47.579
Half the town was in the woods
last night, Sara, come on.

35:47.613 --> 35:49.881
And what about Beethoven?
He was howling.

35:49.915 --> 35:52.684
Dogs howl when they're
around ghosts.

35:52.718 --> 35:55.621
Dogs also howl at fire engines.
Look, the point is

35:55.654 --> 35:57.856
we've got to stay
focused here, Sara.

35:57.889 --> 36:00.792
I mean there is big money
at stake here, and we have
the only key.

36:02.928 --> 36:05.531
Thirds?

36:05.564 --> 36:07.866
Oh, man, you really
are milking it,
aren't you, pal?

36:08.900 --> 36:09.768
Okay.

36:12.504 --> 36:14.973
Sara:
So what's up with you
and Sheriff Julie?

36:15.006 --> 36:16.942
There's
no story there.

36:16.975 --> 36:18.444
She's way out
of my league.

36:19.545 --> 36:21.780
Come on,
that's not true.

36:21.813 --> 36:23.349
You should
ask her out.

36:24.850 --> 36:26.918
- Well, actually, I--
- ( doorbell rings )

36:26.952 --> 36:28.387
Saved by the bell.

36:32.658 --> 36:35.361
Good morning.
Good morning!

36:35.394 --> 36:36.795
Oh, how... shabby.
( laughs )

36:38.897 --> 36:41.567
Hello, dearie, how are you?
Come with me.

36:41.600 --> 36:43.235
I brought a present
for you, dear.

36:43.269 --> 36:45.571
A welcome-to-Quicksilver
present.

36:45.604 --> 36:47.839
That's how we locals are--
friendly.

36:47.873 --> 36:49.641
- Lip gloss galore.
- Oh, thank you.

36:52.411 --> 36:55.681
Where's Beethoven?
I thought he and Baby Cakes
could share some quality time.

36:57.283 --> 37:00.452
They got along
so well the other day.

37:00.486 --> 37:03.889
- Beethoven?
- Oh, yes, of course.
They're just like soul mates.

37:03.922 --> 37:06.892
Baby Cakes would like us all
to take a big long walk
together!

37:09.428 --> 37:10.762
( gasps ) Oh, oh!
( shrieks )

37:12.764 --> 37:15.501
Baby Cakes!
She's just playing hard to get.

37:15.534 --> 37:17.936
Come back, sweetie.
Listen to Mommy.

37:17.969 --> 37:20.439
Sweetheart, come back.
What did Mommy do wrong?

37:24.576 --> 37:27.279
Oh! This isn't
the plan.

37:27.313 --> 37:29.848
Baby Cakes, Beethoven will think
you don't like him.

37:29.881 --> 37:34.353
- Yeah, I can see they
get along just great.
- Baby Cakes!

37:34.386 --> 37:37.356
Freddy:
Okay, so a few people
know about the money.

37:37.389 --> 37:39.525
It's not the end
of the world.

37:39.558 --> 37:42.394
We just have to lay low and not
attract any undue attention.

37:42.428 --> 37:45.664
- Got it? Good boy.
- Greetings, canine!

37:45.697 --> 37:48.900
- Hey, Beethoven!
- Hey, Beethoven,
where's the loot?

37:48.934 --> 37:51.803
- Hey, big dog. Woof, woof!
- Woman: Hey, Beethoven,
you rock!

37:53.972 --> 37:56.475
Oh, brother.
Well, so much for laying low.

37:56.508 --> 37:58.644
Yoo-hoo, Beethoven!
Want to come over
and play?

37:59.778 --> 38:02.514
Oh, yeah.
Beethoven's great, isn't he?

38:02.548 --> 38:05.884
Don't you just love him?

38:05.917 --> 38:08.754
Aren't you Mr. Popular, maybe
you ought to run for mayor.

38:08.787 --> 38:10.656
- Come out and visit!
- Hey, puppy.

38:10.689 --> 38:13.492
Maybe I ought to start drooling
and people would wave at me.

38:13.525 --> 38:14.826
Beethoven,
say "cheese."

38:15.894 --> 38:17.429
- Nice smile.
- ( sighs )

38:24.135 --> 38:26.405
Hey, wait, don't I get
to buy anything here?

38:31.743 --> 38:34.846
- ( barks )
- Oh, good idea, Beethoven.

38:34.880 --> 38:37.483
We'll do a little cleaning.
That'll make Sara happy.

38:49.728 --> 38:51.430
Ahh, finally we agree
on something.

38:59.905 --> 39:01.640
( laughs )
Oh, what was I thinking?

39:05.711 --> 39:07.345
All right,
how's that Beethoven?

39:10.982 --> 39:11.983
( sighs )

39:13.452 --> 39:14.420
Julie.

39:17.088 --> 39:18.957
Okay, look cool,
stay calm, act natural.

39:21.593 --> 39:23.629
I should go over there
and talk to her.

39:23.662 --> 39:25.697
No, she's not going
to want to talk to me.

39:35.941 --> 39:37.108
No, Beethoven.

39:43.582 --> 39:44.516
Stop.

39:50.989 --> 39:52.924
Most people would have
just said hello.

39:54.125 --> 39:55.093
Hello.

39:59.731 --> 40:02.868
- Aw, what a mess!
- I'm sorry.

40:02.901 --> 40:05.804
You'll have to
forgive him, it's his
first time shopping.

40:05.837 --> 40:09.007
So, uh...
when'd you become
a wrestling fan?

40:09.040 --> 40:12.644
Oh, since your dad took down
"Titus the Terminator"
in Houston.

40:12.678 --> 40:14.680
Boy, I mean,
what a takedown.

40:14.713 --> 40:16.582
That was absolutely
brilliant.

40:16.615 --> 40:18.650
"Defy the Equalizer
and be equalized!"

40:20.051 --> 40:21.987
Wow, you really
are a fan.

40:22.020 --> 40:23.822
Yeah, well,
you know.

40:23.855 --> 40:25.957
I nearly cried
when he lost
the championship

40:25.991 --> 40:28.193
to "The Bricklayer"
in Memphis, I mean,
oh, man.

40:28.226 --> 40:30.562
I did not sleep
for a week.

40:30.596 --> 40:32.030
You know it was
all scripted, right?

40:32.063 --> 40:33.932
Yeah, I know,

40:33.965 --> 40:35.601
but I was just
a little kid, you know?

40:35.634 --> 40:37.068
What does a little
kid know?

40:37.102 --> 40:39.104
Oh, remember this?

40:39.137 --> 40:40.839
"The Equalizer
Death Grip."
Yeah!

40:44.275 --> 40:46.878
- Oh that's a good one.
Do you remember this?
- Oh!

40:46.912 --> 40:48.580
- "Gentleman Jim"?
- Yeah.

40:52.283 --> 40:54.986
- Sorry.
- Oh, no, no, no, really.
I was impressed.

40:55.854 --> 40:56.888
- Really?
- Yeah.

40:59.257 --> 41:01.727
- Well, I think maybe--
- ( cell phone ringing )

41:01.760 --> 41:03.529
Oh, sorry,
I've got to get this.

41:04.162 --> 41:05.531
Sheriff. Yeah?

41:11.670 --> 41:13.572
- Julie: Right.
- Nice try, big fella.

41:21.680 --> 41:24.082
It's pretty simple.

41:24.115 --> 41:27.018
One talisman for you,
one for me.

41:27.052 --> 41:29.521
Salt for you,
salt for me.

41:29.555 --> 41:31.089
Nettle for you,
nettle for me.

41:33.692 --> 41:35.260
Pa-kua for you,
pa-kua for me.

41:37.195 --> 41:39.130
We now have maximum
ghost protection.

41:41.266 --> 41:44.703
I don't think Mom
would want me to go.
She'd want me to stay home.

41:44.736 --> 41:47.172
Wait, I forgot
to give you the most
important thing--

41:48.740 --> 41:50.108
"the Peruvian
Crystal."

41:54.079 --> 41:56.982
Wow.
What is it again?

41:57.015 --> 42:00.318
It's the Peruvian Crystal.
It's from the lost city
of Machu Picchu.

42:00.351 --> 42:02.588
Not only does it ward
off ghosts,

42:02.621 --> 42:05.156
it also protects
you against all danger.

42:05.190 --> 42:08.026
Just remember,
it's got to be
on you at all times.

42:08.059 --> 42:09.995
But what if something
goes wrong?

42:10.028 --> 42:11.663
Come on,
you've got to come.

42:12.964 --> 42:14.065
You coming?

42:17.068 --> 42:18.203
We need you.

42:29.380 --> 42:32.651
All right, kids, I've got
your flashlights right here.

42:32.684 --> 42:34.953
- Freddy, what d'you
have for dinner?
- Nothing.

42:34.986 --> 42:37.923
- ( sniffing )
I don't smell anything.
- Yeah, I smell garlic.

42:37.956 --> 42:39.658
- What is that?
- ( growling )

42:39.691 --> 42:42.761
Oh, you big traitor!

42:42.794 --> 42:46.197
Okay, sure, I've got a little
garlic here just as insurance
to keep the ghosts away.

42:46.231 --> 42:48.266
- Come on, let's go.
- I thought you didn't
believe in ghosts.

42:48.299 --> 42:50.268
And, garlic's
for vampires.

42:50.301 --> 42:52.638
They have vampires?

42:52.671 --> 42:54.239
Okay, Beethoven,
get a good whiff of this

42:54.272 --> 42:55.974
and then show me
the money.

42:59.310 --> 43:02.047
Freddy: I'm smelling a Ferrari
and a liquid plasma TV,
come on.

43:02.080 --> 43:03.148
( growls )

43:04.716 --> 43:05.884
Sara:
What is it, boy?

43:06.384 --> 43:07.619
( whines )

43:09.788 --> 43:12.791
- Do you see that?
- Yeah, maybe we ought
to hold on a second.

43:12.824 --> 43:15.727
- And come on back tomorrow.
- Exactly.

43:15.761 --> 43:17.863
- They're coming for us!
- Go, go, go, go!

43:21.800 --> 43:23.134
- ( barking )
- Beethoven!

43:26.004 --> 43:28.139
Beethoven,
get back here!

43:28.173 --> 43:29.607
Beethoven!
Whoa! Oh!

43:30.208 --> 43:31.276
What the...?

43:32.811 --> 43:35.046
Oh, man,
I cannot believe--

43:35.080 --> 43:38.784
Uncle Freddy,
what are you
doing up there?

43:38.817 --> 43:40.919
Oh, I'm just hanging
upside down 'cause I like it.

43:40.952 --> 43:44.389
- Hold on a second.
Don't worry, I got it.
- Get me down!

43:44.422 --> 43:47.025
- I got rope burns on my butt.
- I'll cut you down.

43:47.058 --> 43:48.626
What am I,
a sack of potatoes?

43:49.695 --> 43:51.697
Garrett--
no, no, no.

43:51.730 --> 43:53.198
Garrett, do not cut--

43:53.231 --> 43:54.733
( grunts )
--the rope.

43:56.935 --> 43:59.070
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, fine.

44:00.438 --> 44:02.340
- What's with Beethoven?
- ( barking )

44:03.942 --> 44:04.910
Come on!

44:06.377 --> 44:08.780
Help me! Help!

44:08.814 --> 44:10.949
Come get this tank
off of me!

44:10.982 --> 44:13.351
Come on, Beethoven.
Off, off, off, off.

44:13.384 --> 44:14.419
Here. Cora?

44:16.421 --> 44:19.124
- That's Crazy Cora.
- Cora: Freddy?

44:19.157 --> 44:21.459
- Why is she crazy?
- Cora: Are you out
of your mind?

44:21.492 --> 44:24.229
Those aliens could
abduct that young
little girl

44:24.262 --> 44:26.031
just the way
they did it to me.

44:26.064 --> 44:27.132
Never mind.

44:28.867 --> 44:31.436
Unlike every else,
she's really crazy.

44:31.469 --> 44:33.171
What I want
to know, Cora,

44:33.204 --> 44:35.874
is what's with all
the traps around here?

44:35.907 --> 44:38.209
Did I catch you?

44:38.243 --> 44:41.412
- Oh, maybe you did
and maybe you didn't.
- ( laughs )

44:41.446 --> 44:44.049
Too many people
sneaking around
up here of late.

44:44.082 --> 44:46.351
The wood creatures
don't like it.

44:46.384 --> 44:48.754
They told me so,
telepathically.

44:48.787 --> 44:50.789
Hmm. You know what
I think, Cora?

44:50.822 --> 44:52.758
I think it's you don't
want any people

44:52.791 --> 44:54.793
around here looking
at your still.

44:54.826 --> 44:56.461
What still?

44:56.494 --> 44:58.864
Hey, I was just reading
about stills.

44:58.897 --> 45:01.967
Is it a pot still
or a column still?

45:02.000 --> 45:04.269
Well, I can't confirm
or deny that I have
a still.

45:05.904 --> 45:08.173
But if I did
have a still,

45:08.206 --> 45:10.308
of course it would be
a column still.

45:10.341 --> 45:13.078
Do you single
or double distill?

45:13.111 --> 45:15.446
Well, I don't distill
since I don't have a still.

45:15.480 --> 45:17.883
But, if I did
have a still,

45:17.916 --> 45:19.717
I'd triple distill
for smoothness.

45:21.853 --> 45:25.090
- Now, if you had
a theoretical still--
- Oh, what the hey,

45:25.123 --> 45:27.893
why don't you just come
and have a look at it, kid?

45:27.926 --> 45:30.328
Sara:
What's a still, anyway?

45:30.361 --> 45:32.964
- Garrett: It's kind of a
homemade whiskey warehouse.
- Oh.

45:32.998 --> 45:35.834
- Cora: Business has
b een slow, Freddy.
- Really?

45:35.867 --> 45:37.769
I was hoping you were
a new customer.

45:39.337 --> 45:42.173
So, all these people are
looking for Rita and Moe's cash?

45:44.843 --> 45:47.012
Oh, that's a hoot!

45:47.045 --> 45:49.981
Don't they know Rita and Moe
took it with them?

45:50.015 --> 45:53.251
Cora, you can't take it
with you when you go.

45:53.284 --> 45:56.021
No, they took it
with them-- to Cleveland.

45:56.054 --> 45:58.289
Or maybe it was
Kansas City.

45:58.323 --> 46:01.459
No, no, no,
they drowned right here.

46:01.492 --> 46:03.962
You can't believe what
you read in the papers.

46:03.995 --> 46:06.531
No, my daddy told me--
they got away,

46:06.564 --> 46:08.900
they settled down,
they raised a family...

46:09.968 --> 46:11.436
probably joined the PTA.

46:15.573 --> 46:18.376
Cora:
Yep, Rita and Moe must have
been living on easy street.

46:18.409 --> 46:21.412
- There's no loot?
- But Beethoven found
this $10 bill.

46:21.446 --> 46:22.881
They're long gone.

46:22.914 --> 46:24.049
The Elohim...

46:26.417 --> 46:28.486
the most holy of all
the extraterrestrials.

46:30.889 --> 46:32.157
They saw it all.

46:35.526 --> 46:37.395
And reported it back
to my daddy.

46:41.099 --> 46:43.468
Well, we gotta be
pushing off, Cora.

46:43.501 --> 46:45.303
But I'm sure business
will pick up.

46:47.638 --> 46:49.975
Sara:
Eew, that stinks.

46:50.008 --> 46:51.176
( Cora laughing )

46:58.649 --> 47:01.052
You were right,
Freddy.

47:01.086 --> 47:02.353
Business did just
pick up.

47:05.656 --> 47:08.559
Sara:
Uncle Freddy, you stink.

47:08.593 --> 47:12.163
Smells like you've
been to a few too many
happy hours.

47:12.197 --> 47:13.865
- ( barks )
- ( siren blares )

47:13.899 --> 47:16.567
Oh, no, I do not
believe this.

47:16.601 --> 47:19.004
- What's wrong?
- I can't let Julie
smell me like this.

47:19.037 --> 47:21.239
Okay, somebody else has
gotta be driving this car.

47:21.272 --> 47:24.275
- Garrett, have you got
your license yet?
- I wish. I'm only 12.

47:24.309 --> 47:26.511
Oh, no.
This looks bad.

47:26.544 --> 47:29.014
This looks really bad.
( pulls emergency brake )

47:37.688 --> 47:38.556
Beethoven?

47:41.026 --> 47:44.229
Whoa, Freddy?
What have you been doing?

47:44.262 --> 47:47.065
I can explain.
This is Cora's moonshine.

47:47.098 --> 47:48.566
I can smell that.
Out of the van.

47:50.201 --> 47:51.202
Oh, man.

47:53.438 --> 47:55.506
You ought to be ashamed
of yourself, Freddy.

47:55.540 --> 47:57.575
- With the kids?
- I am not drunk, okay?

47:57.608 --> 48:00.178
- This is all Beethoven's fault.
- Oh, great.

48:00.211 --> 48:03.281
Now you're trying
to blame the dog?
Arms out, eyes closed.

48:03.314 --> 48:05.516
I do not drink
and drive.

48:05.550 --> 48:08.519
- Right forefinger to your nose.
- Is this really necessary?

48:10.688 --> 48:12.357
Left forefinger
to your nose.

48:14.359 --> 48:16.261
- Satisfied?
- Right elbow to your nose.

48:17.195 --> 48:18.296
- What?
- Do it.

48:21.732 --> 48:23.134
It won't reach.

48:26.004 --> 48:27.238
Stand on one foot.

48:29.107 --> 48:30.976
( laughs )

48:31.009 --> 48:32.643
- Can you hop?
- Oh, ha, ha, ha.

48:34.412 --> 48:35.981
All right, all right,
I get it.

48:37.748 --> 48:39.384
- ( laughing )
- Very funny.

48:47.392 --> 48:49.627
So, you found nothing
on the net?

48:49.660 --> 48:51.963
Nothing we didn't
already know.

48:51.997 --> 48:54.599
That's why I thought
we might have to approach it
the old-fashioned way.

48:54.632 --> 48:57.335
It looks normal,
but this is Quicksilver.

48:57.368 --> 48:59.570
- What's the catch?
- Wait till you see inside.

49:05.043 --> 49:07.512
The building was donated
by some lady who was
a feline freak,

49:07.545 --> 49:09.480
and the cats were part
of the deal.

49:14.552 --> 49:16.087
Sara:
Eew, they're stuffed.

49:18.256 --> 49:20.992
Yep, it creates
an interesting atmosphere.

49:21.026 --> 49:23.194
- Interesting isn't the word.
- I know, I know.

49:25.130 --> 49:26.464
It's a very
weird town.

49:27.798 --> 49:29.567
Hey, come on Beethoven,
come on.

49:30.435 --> 49:31.736
Come on, Beethoven.

49:34.239 --> 49:37.708
So-- so far I found
nothing about
the Seligs.

49:37.742 --> 49:40.211
Why don't you try
looking under
"bank robberies"?

49:40.245 --> 49:41.546
Maybe there'll be
a chapter on Rita
and Moe.

49:41.579 --> 49:44.149
- Yeah, good idea.
- Mm-hmm.

49:44.182 --> 49:47.085
- Looking for something?
- Mr. Giles!

49:47.118 --> 49:49.120
We were just
researching
Rita and Moe.

49:49.154 --> 49:50.288
Rita and Moe.

49:52.090 --> 49:54.559
Yeah, y'know,
the bank robbers?

49:54.592 --> 49:57.295
Yes, every
few years or so

49:57.328 --> 49:59.797
I get a little run
on research about them.

49:59.830 --> 50:02.300
This week it's been
like a stampede.

50:02.333 --> 50:04.269
Apparently some
young girl,

50:04.302 --> 50:05.370
not a local,

50:07.072 --> 50:08.473
found an interesting
$10 bill.

50:09.507 --> 50:12.210
Was that you?

50:12.243 --> 50:13.711
Uh, actually
it was my dog,
Beethoven.

50:14.712 --> 50:16.081
So, it is true.

50:19.150 --> 50:22.287
Do you mind if I see
the money for myself?

50:22.320 --> 50:24.422
Actually, it's
at my Uncle Freddy's house.

50:27.158 --> 50:29.660
Exactly where was
this bill found?

50:29.694 --> 50:32.630
Well, we don't know,
but that's why
we're here.

50:32.663 --> 50:35.133
So we can get clues
about Rita and Moe's
last day.

50:36.234 --> 50:38.536
I can't help you.

50:38.569 --> 50:40.338
- Why?
- Everything is checked out.

50:41.706 --> 50:44.175
- Everything?
- Checked out,
for a long time.

50:46.777 --> 50:48.146
Come on, boy.

50:52.683 --> 50:55.586
Hey--
"The Saga of the Seligs."

50:55.620 --> 50:57.522
- Hey, Garrett, this is it!
- This is it!

50:58.556 --> 51:00.225
- I'll take that.
- ( barks )

51:01.892 --> 51:03.161
But, hey--

51:06.597 --> 51:07.632
Let's go.

51:08.866 --> 51:10.335
Come on,
Beethoven.

51:24.849 --> 51:27.318
Garrett:
What's he taking
it up there for?

51:27.352 --> 51:29.820
I don't know,
but I'm gonna find out.

51:29.854 --> 51:32.457
So, what do you know
about Mr. Giles
the librarian?

51:34.425 --> 51:36.694
Giles?
I don't know.

51:36.727 --> 51:39.597
I'll go out on
a limb and say
he likes books.

51:39.630 --> 51:40.765
- You good?
- Uh-huh.

51:43.301 --> 51:45.770
Dealer takes three.

51:45.803 --> 51:47.872
Well, I don't know.
He's been around forever.

51:47.905 --> 51:50.741
He sticks to himself.
Why?

51:50.775 --> 51:54.179
Well, Garrett and I
went up to the library today

51:54.212 --> 51:55.613
and he seemed
a little strange.

51:57.948 --> 52:00.718
You'll get no argument
from me there.
( chuckles )

52:00.751 --> 52:02.753
Your bet.

52:02.787 --> 52:06.157
- Okay, but one question first.
- Mm-hmm.

52:06.191 --> 52:08.793
What do you call it
again when you have
all the same suit

52:08.826 --> 52:10.828
and they're
all in order?

52:10.861 --> 52:12.330
A straight flush?

52:13.631 --> 52:15.200
Oh, yeah.
That's right.

52:18.269 --> 52:19.737
Okay, then,
I bet all of this.

52:24.275 --> 52:25.243
Take it.

52:27.212 --> 52:29.914
You bluffed me!
Oh, man, I can not
believe it.

52:29.947 --> 52:32.183
I learned
from the best.

52:32.217 --> 52:34.452
Torched by a teenager.
I am losing my touch.

52:34.485 --> 52:37.822
- And, to think, I'm only 12.
- Yeah.

52:37.855 --> 52:39.857
- I'm going up to bed.
- Hey, don't eat all those.

52:39.890 --> 52:41.859
- We're playing again tomorrow.
- Okay.

52:44.829 --> 52:46.531
You know,
Camp Freddy's not so bad.

52:47.765 --> 52:49.900
Better than the Bahamas?

52:49.934 --> 52:51.636
Well, I wouldn't go
that far.

52:52.803 --> 52:54.405
- Good night.
- Good night.

52:56.841 --> 52:58.943
Hey, Beethoven,
know what a royal flush is?

53:02.380 --> 53:04.249
Then I'm not playing
you either.

53:11.489 --> 53:12.557
( rustling )

53:41.486 --> 53:42.520
( barks )

54:06.511 --> 54:07.478
( howls )

54:09.780 --> 54:10.848
( barking )

54:21.058 --> 54:22.527
What is it, boy?

54:30.435 --> 54:31.602
What happened?

54:33.103 --> 54:35.406
I think Beethoven
just scared off a burglar.

54:37.608 --> 54:39.677
I heard him howl.

54:39.710 --> 54:41.746
That could've meant
it was the ghosts.

54:41.779 --> 54:45.616
- No, I don't think so.
- Is anything missing?

54:45.650 --> 54:48.319
I don't know, I don't even
know what I have.

54:48.353 --> 54:49.820
Wait a minute,
wait a minute.

54:56.126 --> 54:57.728
The Jackson 10
is missing.

54:59.096 --> 55:01.366
And, look,
they left this in its place.

55:05.536 --> 55:07.605
Julie:
This treasure huntin'
has gotten out of hand.

55:07.638 --> 55:10.575
So, as far as you know,
nothing else was missing?

55:10.608 --> 55:13.878
Well, no...
as far as I know, I think.

55:13.911 --> 55:17.448
The ghost took it.
How else do you
explain the flower?

55:17.482 --> 55:19.617
Julie:
Any idea how they
got in?

55:19.650 --> 55:22.353
Yeah, they got in through
the window, which I left open.

55:24.021 --> 55:26.824
It's a hot night.

55:26.857 --> 55:29.594
Sara:
But what about Beethoven?
He was howling.

55:29.627 --> 55:30.961
Beethoven never howls.

55:32.830 --> 55:34.565
Honey, listen,
don't worry
about this.

55:36.567 --> 55:38.569
I mean, we got
Beethoven here
to protect us,

55:38.603 --> 55:40.471
we got my trusty
Louisville Slugger,

55:40.505 --> 55:42.740
and Sheriff Julie
is only a phone call away.

55:42.773 --> 55:45.543
We're gonna be safe,
don't worry.

55:45.576 --> 55:47.678
I know,
it's just a little
freaky, that's all.

55:50.180 --> 55:52.750
Hey, listen,
don't you worry about it.

55:52.783 --> 55:54.985
If anybody tries
to come in here,

55:55.019 --> 55:57.555
I'll do my very
best Mark McGwire
impersonation, and I'll--

55:58.423 --> 56:00.725
( laughs )

56:00.758 --> 56:02.693
And I will,
at that point,

56:02.727 --> 56:04.729
call Sheriff Julie
to help.

56:04.762 --> 56:07.064
You see, your uncle will
take good care of ya.

56:09.900 --> 56:11.902
- I better get back
to the station.
- Well, I--

56:13.504 --> 56:14.371
I--

56:21.446 --> 56:22.379
Okay.

56:23.180 --> 56:24.415
Uh, Julie?

56:26.617 --> 56:27.885
Uh...
I was wondering...

56:28.853 --> 56:29.754
if...

56:30.588 --> 56:31.722
you... would--

56:33.891 --> 56:36.994
you wanted us to go
to the station with you?

56:37.027 --> 56:39.163
Oh, no.
That won't be necessary,

56:39.196 --> 56:41.098
I have everything I need
for the moment.

56:41.131 --> 56:43.534
Keep up the good work,
Beethoven.

56:43.568 --> 56:45.936
- And I might have
to deputize you.
- ( barks )

56:45.970 --> 56:47.037
He's great.

56:59.517 --> 57:01.185
I know, I know.

57:01.218 --> 57:04.021
I chickened out.

57:04.054 --> 57:06.924
But what's the point?
She's not gonna go out
with a slob like me.

57:08.659 --> 57:10.761
Well, why don't you ask
her out, Mr. Cool.

57:18.636 --> 57:21.171
Hey, no, no, no.
You already had yours.

57:21.205 --> 57:24.008
No, no, no, no, no.
This is mine.

57:24.041 --> 57:26.210
You know,
everyone in town
has a motive

57:26.243 --> 57:27.645
for stealing
that money.

57:27.678 --> 57:29.580
Woman:
You idiot!

57:29.614 --> 57:32.016
What are you gonna
gamble away next?

57:32.049 --> 57:34.685
One of the kids?

57:34.719 --> 57:38.623
And Phil owes
everyone in town money.
That gives him a motive.

57:38.656 --> 57:41.559
And it's obvious Owen
doesn't believe in floods.

57:41.592 --> 57:44.161
I mean, he's probably been
looking for the money
all the time.

57:47.865 --> 57:50.200
And then there's Stu.
We know he'll do anything
for money.

57:51.702 --> 57:52.970
( change jingles )

57:55.740 --> 57:56.907
( phone rings )

57:59.143 --> 58:00.244
( whistles )

58:01.211 --> 58:02.246
And then...

58:03.013 --> 58:04.048
Evie Kling.

58:05.916 --> 58:07.985
There's a good girl,
there's a good girl.

58:08.018 --> 58:10.555
Who can trust anybody
with a dog that irritating?

58:11.589 --> 58:14.024
And then there's Mr. Giles.

58:14.058 --> 58:16.260
I mean, hoarding all
those Rita and Moe books.

58:18.696 --> 58:20.965
And it's always gonna
bother me

58:20.998 --> 58:22.700
that the day
I tell him that we have

58:22.733 --> 58:24.769
the Jackson 10 dollar bill,
it's stolen.

58:26.203 --> 58:28.639
I mean,
what's up with that?

58:28.673 --> 58:31.642
True. Something's
going on there.

58:31.676 --> 58:35.680
- You know what we need,
Uncle Freddy?
- What?

58:35.713 --> 58:39.884
We need a personal tour of that
special collection room of his.

58:39.917 --> 58:42.252
Okay, all right,
here's the deal--

58:42.286 --> 58:44.789
when there's more
of your drool than
my ice cream

58:44.822 --> 58:47.157
in this bowl, it's yours.
You want it?

58:47.191 --> 58:48.225
Okay, fine.

58:49.927 --> 58:52.129
You don't fool me
with that coy thing,
you know?

58:52.162 --> 58:53.898
I saw you looking off,
pretending

58:53.931 --> 58:56.233
that you didn't want it.
I know you wanted it.

59:00.838 --> 59:02.940
Garrett:
Shh, there he is.

59:02.973 --> 59:04.875
Freddy:
12:00 noon,
just like clockwork.

59:07.277 --> 59:10.080
Giles goes for his
chili burger and Rolaids.
Okay, let's go.

59:17.755 --> 59:20.658
- All yours.
- Okay, Julie would kill me
if she saw me doing this.

59:22.392 --> 59:24.361
Where'd you learn how
to pick locks?

59:24.394 --> 59:26.764
I used to be
a locksmith--
something like that.

59:33.738 --> 59:36.173
It's just up
those stairs.

59:36.206 --> 59:39.276
Okay, fine--
now, nobody touch anything.
No one can know we were here.

59:39.309 --> 59:41.846
All right, you two stay
here and keep guard.

59:41.879 --> 59:44.682
Beethoven and I'll go
on a little recon.
Come on, Beethoven.

59:52.322 --> 59:53.658
Keep it down.
Shh.

59:56.060 --> 01:00:00.330
Beethoven-- what part of
"Don't touch anything"
didn't you understand?

01:00:00.364 --> 01:00:01.598
Come here, boy.
Shh.

01:00:10.040 --> 01:00:10.941
Hey!

01:00:12.442 --> 01:00:14.712
Hey, what are
you doing?

01:00:14.745 --> 01:00:15.780
Beethoven,
cut it out.

01:00:19.249 --> 01:00:21.018
Quiet, or the whole town
will be here.

01:00:21.051 --> 01:00:21.952
Shh.

01:00:25.823 --> 01:00:26.791
No, no!

01:00:36.734 --> 01:00:37.902
Oh, no.
Thank you.

01:00:42.707 --> 01:00:46.043
- Uncle Freddy-- what happened
to being quiet?
- Shh!

01:00:46.076 --> 01:00:48.245
Everything's fine.
I got it under control, okay?

01:00:57.187 --> 01:00:58.122
Okay.

01:01:00.490 --> 01:01:01.926
Like the old days.

01:01:03.393 --> 01:01:05.029
- ( alarm ringing )
- Ahh! Ahh!

01:01:10.300 --> 01:01:11.168
Ahh!

01:01:12.169 --> 01:01:13.037
Shh!

01:01:18.809 --> 01:01:20.077
( ringing continues )

01:01:28.085 --> 01:01:29.153
( silence )

01:01:34.759 --> 01:01:36.894
- Yes, sir.
- That's it.

01:01:36.927 --> 01:01:38.262
We're going up,
come on.

01:01:44.501 --> 01:01:47.204
Needless to say,
I didn't last very long
in the security business.

01:01:47.237 --> 01:01:48.939
- Both: Yeah.
- Come on, bird dog.

01:01:51.942 --> 01:01:53.210
Now, this
is very weird.

01:01:55.780 --> 01:01:59.116
Do you really
think our $10 bill's
going to be in here?

01:01:59.149 --> 01:02:01.018
Freddy:
Well, there's only
one way to find out.

01:02:01.051 --> 01:02:02.820
Let's search
the place, come on.

01:02:04.822 --> 01:02:07.124
Whoa--
Rita and Moe!

01:02:07.157 --> 01:02:09.860
This is a little
suspicious.

01:02:09.894 --> 01:02:11.896
Sara:
Hey, the red carnation.
Let's look in here.

01:02:17.101 --> 01:02:19.436
- Find anything, Freddy?
- Nothing from this century.

01:02:25.009 --> 01:02:26.811
- Hey, look.
- What'd you find?

01:02:27.978 --> 01:02:29.046
Negatives.

01:02:31.115 --> 01:02:33.951
Can't tell
what they're of.

01:02:33.984 --> 01:02:35.886
Garrett:
Must be important
if they kept them in here.

01:02:35.920 --> 01:02:37.021
Sara:
Let me see.

01:03:04.982 --> 01:03:06.984
- What's wrong, Beethoven?
- Someone's coming!

01:03:07.017 --> 01:03:08.919
What?

01:03:08.953 --> 01:03:11.288
Don't panic, okay?
Stay calm.

01:03:11.321 --> 01:03:12.957
- Everybody just, we just--
- Or what, go to jail?

01:03:12.990 --> 01:03:14.091
No, no, no.

01:03:15.392 --> 01:03:17.594
Okay. When I tell you,
I want you to run.

01:03:17.627 --> 01:03:19.563
- What, you're gonna time us?
- What? No. Go, go, go, go.

01:03:19.596 --> 01:03:21.065
Out the front door.

01:03:23.934 --> 01:03:25.169
( clock ringing )

01:03:40.550 --> 01:03:41.919
( ringing stops )

01:03:45.923 --> 01:03:48.458
- We should tell Julie.
- I don't think we want
to tell the sheriff.

01:03:48.492 --> 01:03:51.195
We just broke into the library
and trashed the place.

01:03:51.228 --> 01:03:52.963
I mean, I like her,
but the inside of a jail cell

01:03:52.997 --> 01:03:55.332
is not the best way to make
an impression on her.

01:04:07.244 --> 01:04:08.312
( creaking )

01:04:31.168 --> 01:04:33.237
Hey, don't skimp
on the whipped cream.

01:04:33.270 --> 01:04:34.905
Don't worry, I got
a whole case in the garage.

01:04:34.939 --> 01:04:36.006
Beethoven!

01:04:38.275 --> 01:04:39.944
Breakfast time!

01:04:39.977 --> 01:04:41.045
Beethoven?

01:04:42.947 --> 01:04:43.914
Breakfast time!

01:04:47.985 --> 01:04:49.920
That's weird, he never
misses breakfast.

01:04:51.288 --> 01:04:52.322
Beethoven?

01:04:54.124 --> 01:04:56.260
I'll check
around front.

01:04:56.293 --> 01:04:58.395
Beethoven?
( whistles )

01:04:58.428 --> 01:04:59.896
- Beethoven!
- Beethoven!

01:05:01.966 --> 01:05:03.033
Beethoven!

01:05:06.003 --> 01:05:07.071
Breakfast time!

01:05:10.975 --> 01:05:12.042
Beethoven!

01:05:15.212 --> 01:05:16.280
Beethoven!

01:05:20.017 --> 01:05:22.386
Well, thanks for coming by
so quickly, Julie.

01:05:22.419 --> 01:05:24.989
I don't like it.
Somebody's getting

01:05:25.022 --> 01:05:27.324
- a little too serious
about this money.
- Yeah.

01:05:27.357 --> 01:05:30.094
Don't forget to put
those posters up.

01:05:30.127 --> 01:05:31.628
I'll let you know if I get
any leads on Beethoven.

01:05:31.661 --> 01:05:32.596
Okay.

01:05:37.034 --> 01:05:38.202
( starts engine )

01:05:42.739 --> 01:05:45.575
- ( backfires )
- Sara: We'll find him,
right, Uncle Freddy?

01:05:45.609 --> 01:05:48.512
Don't worry, Sara.
We'll get Beethoven back.

01:05:48.545 --> 01:05:50.414
( coughs )
We'd better get inside.

01:06:00.090 --> 01:06:01.391
- He's missing, huh?
- Yeah.

01:06:04.528 --> 01:06:05.996
Well, that's just
too bad.

01:06:08.698 --> 01:06:09.966
( barking )

01:06:22.812 --> 01:06:25.049
Thanks for letting me post
this here, Mr. Herman.

01:06:25.082 --> 01:06:26.650
- Bye.
- Bye, Sara.

01:06:26.683 --> 01:06:28.752
I'm sorry to hear
Beethoven's missing.

01:06:39.263 --> 01:06:40.164
Whoa.

01:06:48.505 --> 01:06:50.707
Missing, huh?

01:06:50.740 --> 01:06:54.311
I'll bet you a 100 bucks
the dog found a collie
and ran off to Vegas.

01:06:54.344 --> 01:06:57.314
- What makes you say that?
- That's what I'd do.

01:06:57.347 --> 01:07:00.084
Hey, how about
50 bucks? 20?

01:07:00.117 --> 01:07:03.187
- C'mon, give me a number.
- Hey, there you are.

01:07:03.220 --> 01:07:06.656
You gotta check this out.
One and one makes three.

01:07:06.690 --> 01:07:08.125
Whoa!
Rita and Moe
had a baby?

01:07:13.730 --> 01:07:15.499
I know...
I know who has
Beethoven!

01:07:24.408 --> 01:07:27.244
Yes?

01:07:27.277 --> 01:07:31.215
Sorry to bother you, Mr. Giles,
but I need to ask you
a few questions.

01:07:31.248 --> 01:07:33.350
- About what, sheriff?
- We're looking for Beethoven.

01:07:33.383 --> 01:07:36.086
Have you seen him?

01:07:36.120 --> 01:07:38.788
I suggest you check
the Central Cemetery in Vienna.

01:07:38.822 --> 01:07:41.225
Look next
to Mozart's tomb.

01:07:41.258 --> 01:07:43.760
Very funny,
Mr. Giles.

01:07:43.793 --> 01:07:46.830
I meant Beethoven, the dog.
Were you home last night?

01:07:46.863 --> 01:07:48.532
No, I was cleaning
the library.

01:07:50.367 --> 01:07:52.102
And blow-drying
some wet cats.

01:07:54.771 --> 01:07:56.573
Sara:
We know who you
really are.

01:07:56.606 --> 01:07:58.508
You are the son
of Rita and Moe Selig.

01:07:59.309 --> 01:08:02.346
That's preposterous!

01:08:02.379 --> 01:08:05.115
- Why are you so sure of this?
- It was Crazy Cora.

01:08:05.149 --> 01:08:07.484
She said that
Rita and Moe got away.

01:08:07.517 --> 01:08:10.520
She also said she was selling
moonshine to aliens.

01:08:10.554 --> 01:08:13.657
But it made me think,
what if they really did
get away?

01:08:13.690 --> 01:08:15.759
It would explain
why they never
found the bodies.

01:08:15.792 --> 01:08:18.562
And Cora also said
that they had a kid.

01:08:18.595 --> 01:08:21.865
Show them the negative
you printed, Garrett.

01:08:21.898 --> 01:08:23.667
That you were hiding,
Mr. Giles.

01:08:25.234 --> 01:08:28.372
But, what really
did it was this--

01:08:28.404 --> 01:08:29.906
the letters I saw
in the store window.

01:08:29.939 --> 01:08:31.207
Giles is...

01:08:32.642 --> 01:08:33.643
Selig...

01:08:34.877 --> 01:08:36.345
spelled backwards.

01:08:37.514 --> 01:08:39.416
Of course.
An anagram.

01:08:39.448 --> 01:08:42.219
What do you say,
Mr. Giles?

01:08:42.252 --> 01:08:44.654
You're a regular little
detective, aren't you, kid?

01:08:49.193 --> 01:08:51.328
It's true.
Mom and Dad survived

01:08:51.361 --> 01:08:53.763
that plunge
into the lake.

01:08:53.796 --> 01:08:56.866
Of course,
they never did get over it.
Scared them to death.

01:08:56.899 --> 01:08:58.468
They escaped to Canada

01:09:00.504 --> 01:09:04.207
and put their bank robbing
days behind them.

01:09:04.241 --> 01:09:07.377
All these years,
everyone's been looking
in the wrong place.

01:09:07.411 --> 01:09:10.279
They'd buried everything
from all their heists

01:09:10.314 --> 01:09:12.316
somewhere in that
old mercury mine.

01:09:12.349 --> 01:09:16.252
They were too scared
to come back to America.

01:09:16.286 --> 01:09:19.555
Well, besides,
the only map to the money went
down with the car in the lake.

01:09:21.691 --> 01:09:24.528
Anyway, after they died,
I came back here

01:09:24.560 --> 01:09:27.264
to see if I could find
the money, and I never
found a thing.

01:09:27.897 --> 01:09:29.332
Why'd you give up?

01:09:30.466 --> 01:09:31.568
I got tired.

01:09:33.303 --> 01:09:35.738
I thought my secret
was safe until...

01:09:35.772 --> 01:09:38.242
this week when your dog
found some of the loot.

01:09:40.377 --> 01:09:42.546
So, are you going
to bring me to the jail?

01:09:46.783 --> 01:09:49.353
What about Beethoven?
Did you take him?

01:09:49.386 --> 01:09:51.755
No, no.
Go ahead and look around.

01:09:51.787 --> 01:09:54.291
- I didn't take him.
- He isn't here.

01:09:54.324 --> 01:09:56.626
It's too neat, believe me.
He'd be hard to hide.

01:09:58.928 --> 01:10:01.598
Well, then,
there's no reason
to arrest you, Mr. Giles.

01:10:01.631 --> 01:10:03.833
You're not your parents.

01:10:03.867 --> 01:10:05.669
So, if he doesn't have
Beethoven--

01:10:06.603 --> 01:10:07.637
who does?

01:10:30.860 --> 01:10:32.696
It's your moment
of truth, mutt.

01:10:34.030 --> 01:10:36.400
Come here, all right.

01:10:36.433 --> 01:10:38.402
Here, I'm gonna show
you something.

01:10:39.869 --> 01:10:41.938
See this?
There--

01:10:41.971 --> 01:10:43.740
my ticket out
of this dump.

01:10:43.773 --> 01:10:46.576
I loathe this place.

01:10:46.610 --> 01:10:49.012
Oh, look at that.
Huh, see that?

01:10:49.045 --> 01:10:51.281
All right, look,
get a whiff of that cash.

01:10:51.315 --> 01:10:52.949
You smell that?
You smell that?

01:10:52.982 --> 01:10:55.051
That's what we're
gonna find tonight, all right?

01:10:55.084 --> 01:10:58.622
Good. Listen,
you take me to that cash,
or I'll bury you right here.

01:10:58.655 --> 01:11:00.924
Come on, now, now.

01:11:00.957 --> 01:11:04.027
Yeah, keep it up,
keep it up.

01:11:04.060 --> 01:11:06.029
Come on, where is it?
Don't lose it now.
Don't lose it now.

01:11:06.062 --> 01:11:08.064
I've been dreaming
about this day.

01:11:08.097 --> 01:11:10.767
You know you can't
even get a decent latte
in this rat hole?

01:11:10.800 --> 01:11:12.902
Just keep going,
come on, come on.

01:11:12.936 --> 01:11:15.305
It's gonna be great.
Whoa!

01:11:15.339 --> 01:11:17.707
Hey, what the...?
What, you think you're smarter?

01:11:17.741 --> 01:11:20.910
Listen, you can't fool me,
all right? Now, come on!

01:11:20.944 --> 01:11:22.846
Wasting my life in a town
where the yokels

01:11:22.879 --> 01:11:24.681
think a Twinkie
is a French pastry...

01:11:27.784 --> 01:11:29.486
Who said you could
take a break?

01:11:31.488 --> 01:11:33.823
Come on,
dog breath.

01:11:33.857 --> 01:11:35.625
- ( barking )
- Whoa! What the...?

01:11:36.626 --> 01:11:38.428
Hey! Hey!
What? Oh my-- what?

01:11:39.028 --> 01:11:41.365
Ow!

01:11:41.398 --> 01:11:43.967
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
No, no, hey, wait a minute!

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:46.035
Hey, hey, wait, wait,
where're you going?

01:11:46.069 --> 01:11:47.871
Ow! Don't--
wait-- where are you--

01:11:49.839 --> 01:11:51.475
come back,
come back here. Hey!

01:11:52.709 --> 01:11:53.777
Hey! Hey!

01:11:57.814 --> 01:11:58.982
Get back here!
Ow!

01:12:11.595 --> 01:12:12.696
( footsteps )

01:12:17.033 --> 01:12:18.602
- Did you hear that?
- Yeah.

01:12:18.635 --> 01:12:19.636
Come on.

01:12:26.410 --> 01:12:27.477
Beethoven!

01:12:29.979 --> 01:12:32.816
- Beethoven!
- What did they do to you?
Here.

01:12:32.849 --> 01:12:34.951
- Is that better, boy?
- Oh, where were you?

01:12:37.053 --> 01:12:38.354
Hey, where are
you going?

01:12:42.426 --> 01:12:45.094
Come here.
Come here, Beethoven.

01:12:45.128 --> 01:12:46.730
Uncle Freddy, he wants us
to follow him.

01:12:46.763 --> 01:12:47.764
Come on.

01:12:48.998 --> 01:12:51.968
We aren't gonna
follow him?

01:12:52.001 --> 01:12:54.438
Things are getting
a little crazy
around here.

01:12:54.471 --> 01:12:56.806
I'd like to get
you home in one
piece, okay?

01:12:56.840 --> 01:12:59.108
Are you telling me
now you believe
in ghosts?

01:12:59.142 --> 01:13:01.845
No, I'm telling you
now maybe I should

01:13:01.878 --> 01:13:03.880
start using
a little common
sense for once.

01:13:05.482 --> 01:13:07.150
I say we get dressed,
get Garrett,

01:13:08.117 --> 01:13:10.420
and find that money.

01:13:10.454 --> 01:13:13.189
Well, what about
the ghosts?

01:13:13.222 --> 01:13:15.091
Y'know, sometimes
you just have
to jump in

01:13:15.959 --> 01:13:17.561
without your floaties.

01:13:20.697 --> 01:13:23.533
Okay, guys, we've been
out here long enough.

01:13:23.567 --> 01:13:26.570
- It's gonna be light soon.
- Come on, Freddy,
just a little longer.

01:13:26.603 --> 01:13:29.072
- We've got to be close.
- Yeah, well, that's what
w orries me.

01:13:29.105 --> 01:13:31.140
We might run into
something we can't handle.

01:13:31.174 --> 01:13:33.109
Sara:
Wait-- I think he's
got something.

01:13:35.745 --> 01:13:39.015
- Who'd I catch tonight?
- Oh, hey, hey! Over here.

01:13:39.048 --> 01:13:40.917
- Over here! Come on.
- Who is that?

01:13:44.754 --> 01:13:45.955
- Harold?
- Cora.

01:13:54.531 --> 01:13:55.632
( Beethoven barks )

01:13:58.234 --> 01:14:00.837
Sara:
I bet it's in there.
Come on, Garrett, let's go.

01:14:03.039 --> 01:14:04.974
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
come back here!

01:14:05.008 --> 01:14:06.810
We don't know
who we're dealing with.

01:14:06.843 --> 01:14:08.978
- Come on, Uncle Freddy.
- Kids, come back.

01:14:11.280 --> 01:14:13.750
Garrett:
Wow, look at this place!

01:14:13.783 --> 01:14:16.620
Don't you know that mine shafts
and kids equal disaster?

01:14:16.653 --> 01:14:17.721
I hate this.

01:14:19.889 --> 01:14:21.224
( flapping )

01:14:21.257 --> 01:14:22.626
What was that?

01:14:24.961 --> 01:14:26.062
( spitting )

01:14:34.804 --> 01:14:37.607
Garrett:
Oh, my gosh,
he's digging-- look!

01:14:37.641 --> 01:14:41.010
Come on, Uncle Freddy.
What is it, boy?

01:14:41.044 --> 01:14:44.113
- Freddy, he's found something.
- Yeah, what are we standing
around for?

01:14:44.147 --> 01:14:46.049
I thought you hated
mine shafts?

01:14:46.082 --> 01:14:48.518
But I love buried treasure.
Come on, let's go.

01:14:48.552 --> 01:14:50.620
Okay, Beethoven--
dig or get out
of the way.

01:14:50.654 --> 01:14:52.488
Come on, Beethoven,
help out here.

01:14:53.089 --> 01:14:54.090
Come on.

01:15:05.702 --> 01:15:09.072
That's it?
That's your shift?

01:15:09.105 --> 01:15:12.308
Oh, man, well, there better
be something down here more
than a bone, Beethoven,

01:15:12.341 --> 01:15:14.611
or I'll tell ya,
I'm gonna be really angry.

01:15:17.213 --> 01:15:19.182
- Hold it, hold it, hold it.
- What is it?

01:15:22.619 --> 01:15:25.989
- This is it. This is it.
- Oh, my God, the money.

01:15:26.022 --> 01:15:28.558
- Come on, help me with this.
- I can't believe it.

01:15:30.093 --> 01:15:32.762
- We are finding pay dirt.
- There's the lid!

01:15:32.796 --> 01:15:34.798
- Hold it. Hold it.
- That's it, come on!

01:15:37.701 --> 01:15:39.603
- ( all gasp )
- Sara: We're rich!

01:15:39.636 --> 01:15:41.237
Uncle Freddy, we're rich!
Garrett!

01:15:41.270 --> 01:15:42.639
It's beautiful.

01:15:45.742 --> 01:15:48.144
Freddy:
Ka-ching, ka-ching.
( laughs )

01:15:48.177 --> 01:15:51.881
- Ohh!
- You are looking
at Moe and Rita's money.

01:15:51.915 --> 01:15:53.983
- Oh, yeah!
- Come on, let's get it.

01:15:54.017 --> 01:15:55.284
Thank you, Beethoven.

01:15:56.786 --> 01:15:59.956
Put it in the bag.

01:15:59.989 --> 01:16:02.992
Kids, I think we're gonna need
the services of a good
financial planner.

01:16:03.026 --> 01:16:04.327
( engine sputtering )

01:16:13.269 --> 01:16:15.839
Garrett:
What's this, a mechanic
whose truck won't start?

01:16:20.376 --> 01:16:22.111
- What's going on?
- Oh, man.

01:16:24.380 --> 01:16:26.850
It looks like
we're gonna need
a ride out of here.

01:16:27.651 --> 01:16:28.818
Hello? Hello?

01:16:31.054 --> 01:16:33.156
Julie, can you hear me?
Yeah, it's Freddy.

01:16:34.357 --> 01:16:36.225
No, no, no,
not Eddie-- Freddy.

01:16:36.259 --> 01:16:38.127
Oh, Freddy,
where are you?

01:16:38.161 --> 01:16:41.130
Listen, somebody cut
the wires to my truck.

01:16:41.164 --> 01:16:44.233
We got the money,
but we're up here about two
miles on Old Lakeview Road.

01:16:44.267 --> 01:16:47.236
- Can you come and get us?
- I can't hear you,
you're breaking up.

01:16:47.270 --> 01:16:50.807
- What did you say?
- Did you-- can you--
Old Lakeview Road--

01:16:50.840 --> 01:16:53.677
- Old Lakeview Road?
- Yeah, come and get us.
Did you hear that?

01:16:53.710 --> 01:16:55.311
- Okay, I'll be right there.
- Hello?

01:17:00.016 --> 01:17:01.617
- Julie's on her way.
- Good.

01:17:02.351 --> 01:17:03.319
I think.

01:17:05.088 --> 01:17:06.622
( barking, howling )

01:17:11.194 --> 01:17:13.196
- He only does that when--
- He hears ghosts.

01:17:15.098 --> 01:17:17.000
Sara:
Beethoven, come back!

01:17:17.033 --> 01:17:19.769
Freddy:
Beethoven, hold it!
Where do you think you're going?

01:17:19.803 --> 01:17:21.671
Sara:
No, boy, no!
Come back! Beethoven!

01:17:23.206 --> 01:17:25.241
Freddy:
Guys, this is
getting out of hand.

01:17:25.274 --> 01:17:27.010
- We've got to wait for Julie.
- Sara: Beethoven!

01:17:27.043 --> 01:17:29.679
Oh, no, not this again.

01:17:29.713 --> 01:17:31.915
Sara:
Come on, you guys!
There's something in here.

01:17:36.786 --> 01:17:38.688
- Garrett: Whoa!
- Sara: It's a ghost.

01:17:40.023 --> 01:17:41.257
It's Rita and Moe!

01:17:43.192 --> 01:17:44.260
( barking )

01:17:48.264 --> 01:17:49.933
- Beethoven!
- No, Beethoven, no!

01:17:54.503 --> 01:17:55.872
What the heck?

01:18:02.812 --> 01:18:03.980
Cora? Oh, man.

01:18:08.985 --> 01:18:11.087
You've got to train
this moose.

01:18:11.120 --> 01:18:13.757
This is the second time
he's knocked me over.

01:18:13.790 --> 01:18:15.759
- Cora, what is all this?
- All what?

01:18:17.961 --> 01:18:20.063
Look, this--
you pretending to be ghosts.

01:18:24.167 --> 01:18:26.936
So, there were
never any ghosts?

01:18:26.970 --> 01:18:29.305
If I didn't
go along with it,
the Genesis 1

01:18:29.338 --> 01:18:32.475
was going to beam me
straight up.

01:18:32.508 --> 01:18:34.778
And I'm not ready
to go, I'll tell
you that now.

01:18:34.811 --> 01:18:37.013
And even when
I am ready to go,

01:18:37.046 --> 01:18:39.115
it sure as heck's
not gonna be to Saturn.

01:18:41.150 --> 01:18:43.987
So, what--
aliens are behind all this?

01:18:44.020 --> 01:18:46.122
Oh, don't be
such a fool.

01:18:46.155 --> 01:18:47.924
It wasn't the aliens.
It was Harold.

01:18:49.192 --> 01:18:51.194
Harold Herman talked
you into this?

01:18:51.227 --> 01:18:54.230
He spoke to the aliens.

01:18:54.263 --> 01:18:57.466
Well, he was the one
who told us dogs howl
when they're around ghosts.

01:18:57.500 --> 01:19:00.336
Howling?
You want howling?

01:19:00.369 --> 01:19:02.071
- ( silent whistle )
- ( howling )

01:19:04.808 --> 01:19:06.943
Harold gave me this
to lure you guys in here.

01:19:06.976 --> 01:19:08.044
The money.

01:19:10.947 --> 01:19:12.015
It's gone!

01:19:17.386 --> 01:19:18.354
No way!

01:19:51.921 --> 01:19:53.422
Beethoven! Beethoven!
Wait up!

01:19:56.059 --> 01:19:57.193
( backfires )

01:20:01.397 --> 01:20:03.032
Oh, come on, come on.
Not again.

01:20:07.536 --> 01:20:08.404
Oh!

01:20:11.140 --> 01:20:12.008
Oh!

01:20:19.582 --> 01:20:21.017
Get off! Get off!

01:20:25.621 --> 01:20:26.522
Yeow!

01:20:28.191 --> 01:20:29.325
I said get off!

01:20:30.359 --> 01:20:31.294
Ahhh!

01:20:39.435 --> 01:20:40.569
Come on!
Get off!

01:20:47.310 --> 01:20:49.913
Harold, are you okay?
You got some explaining to do.

01:20:49.946 --> 01:20:52.348
- Freddy?
- It's him. He's the one
who kidnapped Beethoven.

01:20:52.381 --> 01:20:54.217
- Don't let him get away!
- Hey!

01:21:01.124 --> 01:21:02.258
Come on.
Come on.

01:21:25.148 --> 01:21:26.882
- Harold!
- Give up, Harold!

01:21:40.029 --> 01:21:41.097
( growling )

01:21:42.731 --> 01:21:44.200
Get him, Beethoven!

01:21:51.707 --> 01:21:53.209
Nice takedown,
big guy.

01:21:57.046 --> 01:21:58.614
- Hey, ow!
- That's for taking
my money.

01:21:58.647 --> 01:22:01.117
And that's for taking
my dog.

01:22:01.150 --> 01:22:03.953
"Equalizer Death Grip."
Dad would be proud.

01:22:03.987 --> 01:22:05.989
Meet the ghost
of Moe and Rita.

01:22:06.022 --> 01:22:08.157
I must admit, the carnation
was a nice touch.

01:22:08.191 --> 01:22:10.726
Julie:
Harold Herman,
you're under arrest.

01:22:10.759 --> 01:22:13.196
Dog napping,
reckless driving,

01:22:13.229 --> 01:22:16.232
hit and run,
and that's just
for starters.

01:22:16.265 --> 01:22:18.634
You know what?
You leave me no choice,
Julie, you're fired.

01:22:18.667 --> 01:22:21.704
You can't fire me,
I'm an elected official.

01:22:21.737 --> 01:22:24.740
I'm the President
of the Chamber of Commerce,
I can fire anybody I want!

01:22:24.773 --> 01:22:26.742
- Let's go, Harold.
- I deserve that money.

01:22:26.775 --> 01:22:28.744
Stuck in this dump
all these years only to have

01:22:28.777 --> 01:22:31.280
my ticket out of here
ruined by some...

01:22:31.314 --> 01:22:34.050
- dumb dog and some
stupid teenagers.
- She's not a teenager.

01:22:34.083 --> 01:22:36.452
- I deserve that money!
- She's only 12.

01:22:36.485 --> 01:22:38.121
Howard:
You almost let me go.

01:22:39.388 --> 01:22:41.524
- You're not dumb.
You're a hero.
- Yeah!

01:22:49.732 --> 01:22:52.301
Freddy:
Ah, the new library's really
looking good, isn't it?

01:22:52.335 --> 01:22:54.737
Garrett:
Yeah, Rita and Moe's money
sure went a long way.

01:22:54.770 --> 01:22:57.106
Freddy:
Nothing like being
a good citizen.

01:22:57.140 --> 01:23:00.043
Look at that--
the bus doesn't get
here for 10 minutes.

01:23:00.076 --> 01:23:03.012
Wait a minute,
we're actually early?

01:23:03.046 --> 01:23:05.648
Yeah. Well, don't
be so surprised.
I've been early before.

01:23:05.681 --> 01:23:06.982
- Like when?
- Well--

01:23:08.817 --> 01:23:11.520
just because I can't
think of an example
doesn't mean I'm lying.

01:23:11.554 --> 01:23:13.656
- So, you got everything?
- Um... uh-huh.

01:23:15.291 --> 01:23:16.592
M&M's...

01:23:16.625 --> 01:23:17.693
Walkman...

01:23:18.561 --> 01:23:19.595
ticket...

01:23:22.365 --> 01:23:24.800
- Ticket? Oh, no, ticket.
- ( barks )

01:23:24.833 --> 01:23:26.802
- Uncle Freddy.
- I gave you the ticket.

01:23:26.835 --> 01:23:29.205
- Didn't I?
- No!

01:23:29.238 --> 01:23:33.142
I think I gave you--
oh, did I give you the ticket?

01:23:33.176 --> 01:23:34.577
- Gotcha!
- Oh, that was good.

01:23:36.545 --> 01:23:39.315
That was real good.
I'm impressed, I'm impressed.

01:23:39.348 --> 01:23:42.218
- ( siren sounds )
- Uh-oh, the cops.

01:23:42.251 --> 01:23:44.653
Okay, you kids run,
I'll try to hold them off
with Beethoven.

01:23:48.724 --> 01:23:50.693
Thought I wouldn't
make it in time.

01:23:50.726 --> 01:23:53.496
I don't think so.
In that baby?

01:23:53.529 --> 01:23:55.598
475 horse power,
zero to 60 in 4.8 seconds.

01:23:56.765 --> 01:24:00.069
She's a beauty,
all right.

01:24:00.103 --> 01:24:02.505
And I have one good-looking
courageous treasure seeker
to thank for it.

01:24:02.538 --> 01:24:03.506
Well...

01:24:05.374 --> 01:24:07.210
Don't I, Beethoven?
You're my hero.

01:24:11.680 --> 01:24:13.716
Thank you
for the police
cruiser.

01:24:13.749 --> 01:24:16.452
I suppose Beethoven
just did it all
by himself, huh?

01:24:16.485 --> 01:24:18.221
I'll thank you
at dinner tonight.

01:24:24.893 --> 01:24:27.163
Freddy:
Oh, boy, here it comes.

01:24:27.196 --> 01:24:29.532
It's official, I guess.
Our little party's over.

01:24:33.669 --> 01:24:36.272
Well, let's get this show
on the road.

01:24:36.305 --> 01:24:37.373
It's okay,
I got it.

01:24:37.406 --> 01:24:38.374
Garrett--

01:24:41.644 --> 01:24:43.212
Here's your
Peruvian Crystal.

01:24:46.382 --> 01:24:48.117
Beethoven,
what are you doing?

01:24:50.386 --> 01:24:53.422
I'm sorry, Garrett.

01:24:53.456 --> 01:24:56.525
I guess this is
as good as time as any
to tell you that it's--

01:24:56.559 --> 01:24:58.627
- it's not really
from Machu Picchu.
- It's not?

01:24:59.528 --> 01:25:00.763
It's rock candy.

01:25:02.698 --> 01:25:04.300
Want one?

01:25:04.333 --> 01:25:05.568
( burps, barks )

01:25:07.936 --> 01:25:10.173
- You lied to me.
- Hey, I had to think fast.

01:25:11.807 --> 01:25:14.243
I mean, you were
gonna chicken out

01:25:14.277 --> 01:25:16.111
and miss the adventure
of a lifetime.

01:25:18.381 --> 01:25:19.682
- You mad at me?
- Yeah.

01:25:21.650 --> 01:25:23.719
- Time to go, Sara.
- But I'll get over it.

01:25:26.289 --> 01:25:30.459
Bye, Sara. We're gonna
miss you around here.
You too, Beethoven.

01:25:30.493 --> 01:25:31.760
Bye, Julie.
Bye, Garrett.

01:25:34.297 --> 01:25:36.465
- Well, I wanted--
- I wanted to--

01:25:36.499 --> 01:25:37.866
- I thought I--
- Uncle Freddy, I--

01:25:37.900 --> 01:25:40.236
Wait, wait, okay--
I have something for you.

01:25:46.342 --> 01:25:47.610
Thanks,
Uncle Freddy.

01:25:48.744 --> 01:25:51.180
I was wondering--

01:25:51.214 --> 01:25:53.949
could I make a reservation
at Camp Freddy next summer?

01:25:53.982 --> 01:25:57.420
Well, that depends
on whether or not you're
gonna be beating me at poker.

01:25:58.587 --> 01:25:59.922
I'm gonna
bleed you dry.

01:26:04.293 --> 01:26:05.694
- ( barks )
- Bye, Uncle Freddy.

01:26:08.597 --> 01:26:10.699
Yes, you can come too.

01:26:10.733 --> 01:26:12.668
But you gotta work
on that drooling thing.

01:26:14.403 --> 01:26:15.671
Come on, Beethoven.

01:26:20.976 --> 01:26:23.312
- Bye, Sara.
- Bye, Sara.
See you next summer.

01:26:23.346 --> 01:26:24.513
Bye, Beethoven!

01:26:33.722 --> 01:26:36.492
- Bye!
- Bye Sara! Bye, Beethoven!

01:26:36.525 --> 01:26:39.328
I'll have a banana split
waiting for ya, Sara.

01:26:39.362 --> 01:26:40.963
Sara:
I'm gonna miss
Uncle Freddy.

01:26:46.034 --> 01:26:48.571
And I can't believe
I'm saying this,

01:26:48.604 --> 01:26:51.240
but I'm actually
gonna miss this town,

01:26:51.274 --> 01:26:52.541
as bizarre as it is.

01:27:05.888 --> 01:27:07.456
Duck, quick,
it's Baby Cakes!

01:27:09.658 --> 01:27:10.893
Too late!
Beethoven!

01:27:12.060 --> 01:27:13.662
Sweetheart, stay! Sit!

01:27:15.531 --> 01:27:18.834
Baby Cakes!
Baby Cakes, why?

01:27:18.867 --> 01:27:21.770
No, please, Baby Cakes,
that is not how a lady acts.

01:27:21.804 --> 01:27:22.905
Oh, Baby Cakes!

01:27:26.609 --> 01:27:29.478
Sara:
Looks like somebody's gonna
miss you, Beethoven.

01:27:29.512 --> 01:27:32.448
So, do you think now
that Quicksilver's

01:27:32.481 --> 01:27:34.450
a little richer,
it'll be any less weird?

01:27:36.519 --> 01:27:37.920
I don't think so either.

01:27:46.529 --> 01:27:48.297
( instrumental music playing )
