WEBVTT

00:14.748 --> 00:16.817
Timing, timing.

00:20.487 --> 00:21.887
Excuse me.

00:21.888 --> 00:23.589
Hey, guys.

00:23.590 --> 00:25.424
You gotta be kidding me.

00:25.425 --> 00:26.860
- Fellas.
- Frank.

00:27.894 --> 00:29.795
You must have grown some balls

00:29.796 --> 00:32.398
or you're just fuckin'
plain stupid coming here, son.

00:32.399 --> 00:35.701
Just let me talk to him
for just... just for a second.

00:35.702 --> 00:37.469
Please.

00:37.470 --> 00:40.040
All right, Jack.

00:41.541 --> 00:43.910
But you've just signed
your own death warrant.

00:45.111 --> 00:48.046
You... you don't look
like you came here

00:48.047 --> 00:50.416
<i>to pay me my money.</i>

00:50.417 --> 00:53.886
What?
You want my advice? Huh?

00:53.887 --> 00:58.525
I was... I was kind of hoping
you could help me out.

01:01.995 --> 01:04.830
You know, Jack,

01:04.831 --> 01:06.498
believe me,

01:06.499 --> 01:10.002
this is not the kind of road
you should go down.

01:10.003 --> 01:12.204
You're a fuckin'
card player, Jack,

01:12.205 --> 01:15.742
<i>and not even a good one.</i>

01:27.754 --> 01:29.456
Are you my friend?

01:30.790 --> 01:32.793
Yeah.

How's that Viagra
working out for you?

04:50.857 --> 04:53.759
Hey, Jack.
What are you playing?

04:53.760 --> 04:55.228
I don't know yet.

04:56.829 --> 04:58.765
What are they playing
over there?

05:01.701 --> 05:05.203
<i>That is so out of your zip code.</i>

05:05.204 --> 05:07.626
<i>Come on, Jack. You know
you don't belong there.</i>

05:10.343 --> 05:12.210
What's the buy-in?

05:12.211 --> 05:13.812
204 on a no-limit hold 'em.

05:13.813 --> 05:15.947
Buy starts at 40,000.

05:15.948 --> 05:18.216
Good, I'll take my usual.

05:18.217 --> 05:19.885
Good luck.

05:19.886 --> 05:22.055
Come on, I don't need luck.
You know that.

05:30.229 --> 05:32.364
Usual Jack and coke?

05:32.365 --> 05:34.700
Oh, sweetheart,
do you even need to ask?

05:34.701 --> 05:38.036
- The name's Stacey.
- Right, Stacey.

05:38.037 --> 05:40.906
All right, well, you... you should get
a name tag or something, sweetheart.

05:40.907 --> 05:43.041
I have a name tag.

05:43.042 --> 05:45.911
Sorry.

05:45.912 --> 05:47.648
Thanks, man.

06:04.864 --> 06:08.033
I raise.

06:08.034 --> 06:11.903
<i>Six vodkas. All right,
bring 'em right over.</i>

06:11.904 --> 06:13.772
Ooh. Ooh.

06:13.773 --> 06:15.774
Ms. love, Ms. love.

06:15.775 --> 06:19.878
You know
I got thrown in jail last night?

06:19.879 --> 06:21.880
I'm not surprised.

06:21.881 --> 06:23.315
<i>What happened?</i>

06:23.316 --> 06:25.817
Never mind. Listen,
I was in there a while,

06:25.818 --> 06:27.385
<i>and I was pretty hungry.</i>

06:27.386 --> 06:30.388
When dinner came,
it was roasted duck,

06:30.389 --> 06:33.825
and... no. No, it was a
bologna sandwich and chips.

06:33.826 --> 06:38.430
No pickles, no lettuce, and
no poker chips... just chips.

06:38.431 --> 06:41.133
Plain. I get to my top bunk,
I'm read to eat dinner,

06:41.134 --> 06:43.301
and this giant
black hand comes up,

06:43.302 --> 06:44.936
<i>takes my sandwich.</i>

06:44.937 --> 06:47.439
<i>So I said,
"hey, bro, what's up?"</i>

06:47.440 --> 06:51.109
He said, "I'm eating your sandwich.
That's what's up."

06:51.110 --> 06:52.944
So I said, "what are you
in here for?"

06:52.945 --> 06:55.893
He goes, "attempted murder."
I said, "you want my chips?"

06:56.883 --> 07:00.385
<i>"You can have 'em, man.
I'm not even hungry anymore."</i>

07:00.386 --> 07:02.454
- No doubt.
- "Just please don't beat me to death."

07:02.455 --> 07:05.023
I call. I got the gutter
ball, sweetheart.

07:05.024 --> 07:08.226
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

07:08.227 --> 07:11.931
- You want my chips?
- Fuck you.

07:53.339 --> 07:55.607
Thanks.

07:55.608 --> 07:58.243
You never showed up.

07:58.244 --> 07:59.945
Didn't want to show up.

07:59.946 --> 08:02.480
<i>I saw you
checking out the big boys.</i>

08:02.481 --> 08:04.249
I was waiting for you.

08:04.250 --> 08:06.952
Got to know when to hold 'em,
know when to fold 'em.

08:06.953 --> 08:08.987
That's what Kenny Rogers says.

08:08.988 --> 08:10.088
<i>Do you?</i>

08:10.089 --> 08:11.489
Do I what?

08:11.490 --> 08:13.992
Know when to fold 'em,
when to walk away,

08:13.993 --> 08:15.927
when to run?

08:15.928 --> 08:18.496
I don't know, man. I'm just
trying to get from point "a"

08:18.497 --> 08:21.032
to point "B" without conflict,
you know what I mean?

08:21.033 --> 08:22.901
If only it were that simple.

08:22.902 --> 08:25.871
You play cards a lot.

08:25.872 --> 08:28.006
I play people.

08:28.007 --> 08:31.910
I study 'em, I figure out how I
can use 'em to make some money,

08:31.911 --> 08:35.280
adjust my own behavior
accordingly.

08:35.280 --> 08:37.284
I do the same thing that you do.

08:39.051 --> 08:42.087
Well, I guess we all play each
other to a certain extent.

08:42.087 --> 08:45.223
<i>No, not to a certain extent.</i>

08:45.224 --> 08:48.360
We play people for money.

08:48.361 --> 08:51.496
That what you're doing
right now?

08:51.497 --> 08:53.565
Huh? Is that
what you're doing right now?

08:53.566 --> 08:56.034
- Playing me for money?
- Maybe.

08:56.035 --> 08:58.403
Well, you're shit out of luck.
I don't have any money.

08:58.404 --> 09:00.038
Well, let me ask you something.

09:00.039 --> 09:02.540
How'd you like
to make some dollars?

09:02.541 --> 09:05.076
Enough dollars to keep you
at the adult table

09:05.077 --> 09:07.080
for a long long time.

09:08.581 --> 09:11.017
Here, my card.

09:15.454 --> 09:17.455
Okay, I'll take your card...

09:17.456 --> 09:21.092
And I will give you my card.

09:21.093 --> 09:23.395
You can call me anytime,

09:23.396 --> 09:25.463
day or night.

09:25.464 --> 09:27.100
Okay?

09:34.040 --> 09:35.475
Hold on to it.

09:36.710 --> 09:38.710
And give me a call
if you feel like it.

09:38.711 --> 09:40.045
I'll see around, Jack.

09:40.046 --> 09:43.114
Now wait a minute,
how do you know my name?

09:43.115 --> 09:44.983
Everybody knows your name, Jack.

09:44.984 --> 09:48.054
You're the dude that draws
to a gutshot straight...

09:49.055 --> 09:51.222
And wins.

09:51.223 --> 09:54.060
Call me... or not.

10:04.303 --> 10:06.373
"Duffy."

10:21.687 --> 10:23.154
<i>You back again?</i>

10:23.155 --> 10:24.658
Hey, Jack.

10:39.572 --> 10:41.673
Hey, Carl, good to see you.

10:41.674 --> 10:44.142
I've got some news
for you, Jack.

10:44.143 --> 10:49.214
Paulie trunks'...
Lost all his patience for you.

10:49.215 --> 10:51.150
Well, that's not
really news, is it?

10:52.785 --> 10:56.056
You just give me the rest
of what's left, Jack?

10:58.224 --> 11:00.593
Okay. Okay.

11:01.594 --> 11:03.728
It's right here.

11:03.729 --> 11:06.166
It's right here.
There you go.

11:13.672 --> 11:17.208
<i>Jack, if we come back
for the extra 10 grand,</i>

11:17.209 --> 11:20.714
I think even you're smart enough
to know what's gonna happen.

11:22.581 --> 11:25.051
I'll leave you there
to think about it.

11:47.073 --> 11:49.208
Guys, guys, hey, guys.

11:52.511 --> 11:55.413
I was thinking.

11:55.414 --> 11:58.149
It's strange,

11:58.150 --> 12:01.286
<i>but for fuckin'
some dumb reason,</i>

12:01.287 --> 12:03.288
<I>I like Jack.

12:03.289 --> 12:06.026
And I save him, I save his life.

12:06.859 --> 12:09.227
Now to thank me...

12:09.228 --> 12:11.729
you know me, I got your back.

12:11.730 --> 12:13.731
Yeah.

12:13.732 --> 12:17.769
Well, I'm over here
trying to get some work done.

12:17.770 --> 12:19.838
You gotta just trust me, man.

12:19.839 --> 12:22.507
You know?
It's all about loyalty.

12:22.508 --> 12:24.544
Yeah, now you're talking
my language.

13:01.614 --> 13:04.816
<i>Hello? Are we
going to get to go</i>

13:04.817 --> 13:06.151
- to princess palace this weekend?
- Honey.

13:06.152 --> 13:08.286
- Because I wanna bring...
- honey, give me the phone, okay?

13:08.287 --> 13:10.288
Mom, I want to listen
to what he has to say!

13:10.289 --> 13:12.357
<i>I know, honey. Honey, go...
go wash your face.</i>

13:12.358 --> 13:15.253
<i>- I'll give you the phone in a minute, okay?
- Oh, mom!</i>

13:19.732 --> 13:21.234
Jack...

13:22.535 --> 13:25.904
She's really excited to go to princess
palace with you this weekend.

13:25.905 --> 13:27.939
You have to show up
this time, Jack.

13:27.940 --> 13:31.376
<i>I cannot handle watching her be
disappointed like that again.</i>

13:31.377 --> 13:32.811
<i>I'm serious. If you say
you're gonna do it,</i>

13:32.812 --> 13:35.381
<i>you have to show up
this time, okay?</i>

14:17.256 --> 14:18.858
Morning.

14:20.626 --> 14:22.495
Is that guy coming over again?

14:26.498 --> 14:28.399
Probably not.

14:28.400 --> 14:29.233
Yes!

14:29.234 --> 14:32.338
He's kinda creepy
and smells bad.

14:48.454 --> 14:50.488
<i>Jack Daniel, is it?</i>

14:50.489 --> 14:54.627
Yeah, yeah, I have a cousin named Jim beam.
Isn't that weird?

14:55.761 --> 14:57.362
Sure you do.

14:57.363 --> 14:59.397
Got a nephew named Johnny Walker

14:59.398 --> 15:03.368
and an aunt
named Chevitz with a "T."

15:03.369 --> 15:05.422
- It's not the same.
- It's really cool.

15:07.406 --> 15:08.406
Okay.

15:09.342 --> 15:12.744
Mr. Daniel,
it appears we have a problem.

15:12.745 --> 15:14.579
Yeah, what's the problem, Kelly?

15:14.580 --> 15:19.284
You have an outstanding
amount... past due, actually.

15:19.285 --> 15:21.452
No no, I paid that already.

15:21.453 --> 15:24.324
According to our records,
you have not.

15:26.692 --> 15:29.594
Are you sure it's not
a mistake on your end?

15:29.595 --> 15:31.929
Our records
are very meticulous, sir.

15:31.930 --> 15:33.731
I'm sure they are, yeah.

15:33.732 --> 15:35.933
I'm afraid there is
nothing I can do for you

15:35.934 --> 15:37.403
until that amount is paid.

15:39.505 --> 15:41.374
Kelly.

15:42.374 --> 15:44.976
Let me ask a question.

15:44.977 --> 15:46.846
Do you like dessert?

15:48.480 --> 15:49.881
Of course.

15:49.882 --> 15:51.416
Who doesn't, right?

15:51.417 --> 15:53.751
Well, I know a place
that does this bread pudding,

15:53.752 --> 15:56.554
and they put caramel
all over the top of it,

15:56.555 --> 15:59.457
and they put like,
Cap'n Crunch in there.

15:59.458 --> 16:01.993
And I know it's wild,
but it's delicious.

16:01.994 --> 16:05.763
And I will order that
over and over and over again

16:05.764 --> 16:08.501
till you get full.

16:11.403 --> 16:15.473
If you just make... just
make this loan go through.

16:15.474 --> 16:17.408
I appreciate the offer, sir,

16:17.409 --> 16:19.110
but there's really nothing

16:19.111 --> 16:20.912
I can do until
that amount is paid.

16:20.913 --> 16:23.416
I'll shave.

16:25.351 --> 16:27.420
I'm signing it.

16:28.821 --> 16:31.022
And there he is.
Hey, Chuck.

16:31.023 --> 16:32.123
Hello, sir.

16:32.124 --> 16:34.959
Looks like you owe us
a little money there, Jack.

16:34.960 --> 16:36.461
<i>I can't help you out, man.</i>

16:36.462 --> 16:38.496
Well, it's a tough economy
out there, Chuck.

16:38.497 --> 16:40.064
I gotta ask you to go.

16:40.065 --> 16:41.501
Leave?

16:42.735 --> 16:46.504
<i>- Look, I understand where you're coming from, Chuck.
- No, sir, really.</i>

16:46.505 --> 16:48.072
<i>- Kelly and I were talking...
- sir, you really have to leave.</i>

16:48.073 --> 16:49.942
Sir, you really have to leave.

16:53.011 --> 16:55.113
Sir, I don't want
to tell you again.

16:55.114 --> 16:57.749
You need to leave.
Really, go!

16:57.750 --> 16:59.417
He's a real charmer.

16:59.418 --> 17:01.521
Do you mind if I borrow a pen?

17:08.827 --> 17:13.064
Do you think we should
take Chuck to dessert with us?

17:13.065 --> 17:15.835
I don't think so either.
Ahem.

17:36.555 --> 17:38.456
God damn it.

17:38.457 --> 17:39.824
Hey, excuse me, bud,

17:39.825 --> 17:42.527
do you mind if I borrow your phone
just a second? This one's busted.

17:42.528 --> 17:43.795
I'm in a hurry, man.

17:43.796 --> 17:46.631
Yeah, it's a really important phone call.
Just for one second.

17:46.632 --> 17:47.865
I got ice cream here.

17:47.866 --> 17:50.501
Okay, well, I tell you what.
You a smoker?

17:50.502 --> 17:52.003
Yeah.

17:52.004 --> 17:55.139
How about a pack of smokes
for the phone, 20 seconds?

17:55.140 --> 17:58.176
Quick one.

17:58.177 --> 17:59.811
- All right.
- Oh, you're a gentleman.

17:59.812 --> 18:01.112
Thank you, man.

18:01.113 --> 18:02.682
Thanks.

18:05.551 --> 18:07.919
A lighter.
Yeah, hang on a second.

18:07.920 --> 18:09.754
<i>Yeah?</i>

18:09.755 --> 18:11.722
Yeah. Yeah, Duffy,
it's me, Jack.

18:11.723 --> 18:13.491
You can keep it.
I don't want it.

18:13.492 --> 18:14.826
Jack who?

18:14.827 --> 18:17.695
<i>Jack, we met
at the casino this morning.</i>

18:17.696 --> 18:21.566
Oh. Oh, yeah,
gutshot Jack.

18:21.567 --> 18:24.135
You mentioned something about
an opportunity earlier.

18:24.136 --> 18:25.772
Opportunity?

18:27.502 --> 18:30.608
I don't remember saying anything
about an opportunity, Jack.

18:30.609 --> 18:32.877
You said if I wanted
to some big dollars

18:32.878 --> 18:35.646
and sit at the adult table,
to call you, remember?

18:35.647 --> 18:37.148
Well, I remember that,

18:37.149 --> 18:40.485
but it's not quite
an opportunity.

18:40.486 --> 18:42.487
There's a difference,
you know, son.

18:42.488 --> 18:44.689
<i>Okay, there's a difference.
I'm interested.</i>

18:44.690 --> 18:46.090
You're interested?

18:46.091 --> 18:47.758
Yeah, in making
some big dollars.

18:47.759 --> 18:49.660
That's why
I'm fucking calling you, man.

18:49.661 --> 18:51.729
Well, now you're talking, Jack.

18:51.730 --> 18:53.598
Ice cream.

18:53.599 --> 18:55.633
<i>- You know a joint called déjà-vu?
- Yeah.</i>

18:55.634 --> 18:57.902
All right, gutshot.

Looks like you have
a lot of them, too.

21:41.933 --> 21:44.268

That covers an awful lot
of character flaws.

21:52.444 --> 21:54.845
Well, how can you tell I'm rich?

21:54.846 --> 21:58.883
I can just tell.
It's what I do. It's my job.

21:58.884 --> 22:01.719
You say you play people,
I say I read them.

22:01.720 --> 22:03.389
Okay.

22:04.890 --> 22:06.092
Read me, son.

22:07.325 --> 22:10.361
You have a manicure
and you're not a woman.

22:10.362 --> 22:13.264
You're tan
and it's not summertime.

22:13.265 --> 22:15.866
Your suit certainly didn't come
from men's warehouse.

22:15.867 --> 22:19.770
Chicago-roll timepiece and that
pinky ring's no knock-off.

22:19.771 --> 22:23.240
You're far-sighted. I can tell by the
subtle marks on the bridge of your nose

22:23.241 --> 22:25.342
<i>that you wear reading glasses.</i>

22:25.343 --> 22:28.746
But the one thing that tells me
you've got money the most

22:28.747 --> 22:30.748
is you're comfortable
looking your age,

22:30.749 --> 22:32.950
which is somewhere
approaching 60.

22:32.951 --> 22:36.120
And anyone's that's comfortable
looking your age,

22:36.121 --> 22:38.723

they got a lot of money.

22:41.460 --> 22:44.195

22:44.196 --> 22:46.197
is either in love with their job

22:46.198 --> 22:48.232
or isn't any good
at being married.

22:48.233 --> 22:49.800

22:49.801 --> 22:51.370
You're wrong.

23:02.748 --> 23:05.382
<i>How did I make my money?</i>

23:05.383 --> 23:10.287

I haven't figured it out.

23:10.288 --> 23:13.824
Probably by
fucking everybody else over.

23:13.825 --> 23:16.861
You're wrong on your read.

23:16.862 --> 23:19.997
No, no, I think
I'm right as rain.

23:19.998 --> 23:23.300
Well, that's pretty close.

23:23.301 --> 23:25.202
But who doesn't?

23:25.203 --> 23:27.805
Maybe, maybe.

23:27.806 --> 23:32.478
But I am interested in making some of
these big dollars you keep talking about.

29:02.607 --> 29:04.441

31:38.763 --> 31:41.200
Thanks a lot.
You didn't have to do that.

31:42.934 --> 31:45.569
You're welcome.

31:45.570 --> 31:47.871
Where did captain charming go?

31:47.872 --> 31:49.940
Probably back to sleep.

31:49.941 --> 31:51.375
Would you like me
to get him for you?

31:51.376 --> 31:53.578
<i>Oh, yeah, that'd be great.</i>

31:59.851 --> 32:02.421
I know why he brought you here.

32:08.726 --> 32:11.828
You should put your clothes on

32:11.829 --> 32:14.433
and get out of here
before he wakes up.

32:15.600 --> 32:17.402
Okay.

32:19.570 --> 32:22.407
It was nice to meet you.

32:23.941 --> 32:25.644
Good night, Jack.

32:26.644 --> 32:29.414
Did you dry my underwear too?

32:31.382 --> 32:33.285
Very courageous.

34:07.178 --> 34:09.481
<i>You did a good job.</i>

34:13.050 --> 34:15.454
Think I'm probably
gonna take off, though.

34:18.489 --> 34:20.559
Are you really gonna
lose the bet?

34:22.760 --> 34:27.599
I mean, there are worse ways
in the world to make money.

34:44.649 --> 34:47.418
Come in.

34:49.754 --> 34:52.623
<i>So what are you waiting for?</i>

34:57.595 --> 35:00.630
You're not going to punch me
in the face, are you?

35:00.631 --> 35:02.634
Maybe.

35:06.037 --> 35:08.407
Come in.

35:12.009 --> 35:14.578
No, no thanks.

35:14.579 --> 35:17.614
<i>I think I've been in
enough times already tonight,</i>

35:17.615 --> 35:19.249
know what I mean?

35:19.250 --> 35:22.487
<i>Is that a nice way of saying
I lost my touch?</i>

35:28.960 --> 35:30.629
No.

35:32.163 --> 35:34.800
Hand me my robe?

35:41.539 --> 35:43.742
I'm gonna regret this.

35:47.912 --> 35:49.713
Here.

35:49.714 --> 35:51.016
I'll help you up.

35:58.055 --> 36:02.659
You're evil.

36:02.660 --> 36:04.796
You have no idea.

36:53.344 --> 36:56.012
Looks like you're gonna
win the bet after all.

36:56.013 --> 37:00.283
<i>Always knew you would.
I had you pegged.</i>

37:00.284 --> 37:03.353
- Oh.
- God damn it.

37:03.354 --> 37:05.757
<i>I knew you were in on this shit.</i>

37:06.724 --> 37:08.725
<i>Hey, Jack...</i>

37:08.726 --> 37:10.662
Want to see what
50 grand looks like?

37:16.734 --> 37:19.836
Why don't you fuck her?
Something wrong with your dick?

37:19.837 --> 37:22.872
Come on, Jack,
you're a born opportunist.

37:22.873 --> 37:24.207
Embrace it.

37:24.208 --> 37:27.177
This is not gonna happen.

37:27.178 --> 37:29.212
<i>You're ready to do something
behind my back.</i>

37:29.213 --> 37:31.348
But while I'm standing here,
you won't do me the honor

37:31.349 --> 37:33.617
of doing it in front of me
like a man,

37:33.618 --> 37:35.318
when there's good money
on the line?

37:35.319 --> 37:37.053
Tell me, Jack,
just what is that?

37:37.054 --> 37:39.623
What is that?

37:39.624 --> 37:41.791
<i>Huh?!</i>

37:41.792 --> 37:43.226
Do it!

37:43.227 --> 37:45.730
All right, fuck it.

37:48.032 --> 37:50.734
Yeah?

37:50.735 --> 37:53.004
<i>Just pretend I'm not here.</i>

38:17.128 --> 38:19.829
All right, hold on.

38:19.830 --> 38:22.699
All right, all right,
hang on, hang on a second.

38:22.700 --> 38:25.435
Hang on a second.
Okay.

38:25.436 --> 38:26.803
Hey, hey!

38:26.804 --> 38:28.371
I'm not doing this
with your creepy ass

38:28.372 --> 38:29.939
standing there
with a hand Cannon.

38:29.940 --> 38:33.076
You just became ugly.
Nice to meet you.

38:33.077 --> 38:36.713
Shoot me, shoot me.
Go ahead.

38:36.714 --> 38:39.883
You want it in the back, huh?
Or do you want a knife?

38:39.884 --> 38:42.153
Wanna go in there
and get a kitchen knife?

38:45.156 --> 38:48.159
That's what I thought.

38:52.196 --> 38:53.863
Come here a second.

38:53.864 --> 38:56.132
Hey, Jack, Jack, one more thing.

38:56.133 --> 38:58.703
You remember what I told you
about hard love?

38:59.804 --> 39:03.041
How about this?

39:35.906 --> 39:39.042
You want to fuck with me?

39:39.043 --> 39:41.077
<i>Huh?</i>

39:41.078 --> 39:43.281
<i>- Oh my God.
- Get up!</i>

39:44.915 --> 39:46.251
<i>Get up.</i>

39:48.385 --> 39:50.487
Get the fuck up.

39:50.488 --> 39:52.824
Fuckin' play dead with me.

39:57.027 --> 39:59.929
Better not be playing dead.

39:59.930 --> 40:03.032
Holy shit.

40:03.033 --> 40:05.034
<i>You're my witness.
You saw what happened here now.</i>

40:05.035 --> 40:07.070
- Jack.
- I was just protecting myself.

40:07.071 --> 40:08.304
- Jack.
- He fucking jumped on me.

40:08.305 --> 40:10.807
Listen to me.
Listen to me!

40:10.808 --> 40:13.912
It's gonna be fine.

40:16.725 --> 40:18.515
All right,
don't touch him anymore.

40:18.516 --> 40:20.550
Stop. Get away.

40:20.551 --> 40:23.286
Don't move him. They need to
find him just as this happened.

40:23.287 --> 40:25.288
Nothing happened.
No one was ever here.

40:25.289 --> 40:26.923
Hey, wait wait.
Put those down.

40:26.924 --> 40:28.858
Slow down, slow down now for a minute.
Let's just think.

40:28.859 --> 40:30.460
No, we need to get him
out of here as soon as possible.

40:30.461 --> 40:32.462
No, we need to call
the fucking police!

40:32.463 --> 40:34.931
Do you have any idea the kind
of people we're dealing with?

40:34.932 --> 40:37.233
<i>- Nuh-uh.
- If we call the police,</i>

40:37.234 --> 40:39.936
we are dead.
Do you understand?

40:39.937 --> 40:41.805
Not really.

40:41.806 --> 40:46.177
Please help me
get him out of here.

40:48.012 --> 40:50.181
<i>All right, let's go.</i>

40:54.919 --> 40:56.788
It's okay.

40:58.255 --> 41:01.958
I really don't feel comfortable
leaving you with all this.

41:01.959 --> 41:03.827
We don't really have a choice.

41:03.828 --> 41:06.030
All right.

41:07.898 --> 41:10.200
Oh, honey,
are you going to be sick?

41:10.201 --> 41:11.601
Nnnn...

41:11.602 --> 41:14.038
Oh.
Bathroom's on the right.

41:27.218 --> 41:29.953
Are you okay?

41:29.954 --> 41:31.823
I'm great.

41:34.859 --> 41:38.461
This is probably
not the best time for this,

41:38.462 --> 41:41.464
but I just wanted to thank you.

41:41.465 --> 41:43.968
I was a prisoner
in this house, and...

41:45.302 --> 41:48.250
If you makes you feel any
better, you freed me from that.

41:49.573 --> 41:52.010
Yeah, I feel
a lot better, thanks.

41:54.912 --> 41:57.482
I'm gonna to get you
a glass of water.

44:02.172 --> 44:04.007
How much is it?

44:04.008 --> 44:05.241
$45.80.

44:05.242 --> 44:07.477
Here you go, take it.

44:07.478 --> 44:09.078
What's this?

44:09.079 --> 44:11.214
It's your lucky day, pal.

44:11.215 --> 44:13.479
Thanks, man. You sure
you don't want change?

46:01.225 --> 46:03.226
<i>She's the bet.</i>

46:03.227 --> 46:05.129
You're putting up your life.

46:13.203 --> 46:16.240
<i>I know why he brought you here.</i>

47:09.927 --> 47:13.262
Hey! Can I help you?

47:13.263 --> 47:15.299
Hey man, what's up?

47:18.268 --> 47:20.204
I know you.

47:22.239 --> 47:25.543
You were here, right?

47:27.477 --> 47:29.345
You're a friend of Duffy's.

47:29.346 --> 47:33.282
Yeah. Yeah yeah.
It's been a while.

47:33.283 --> 47:35.518
Yeah, I'm...
I'm saying to myself,

47:35.519 --> 47:36.852
"I"... you know,
"I know this guy.

47:36.853 --> 47:38.854
I've seen him before.
He was here."

47:38.855 --> 47:41.691
You were here.

47:41.692 --> 47:43.459
One of the poker nights, right?

47:43.460 --> 47:46.395
Yeah. Maybe, I...
I don't remember.

47:46.396 --> 47:48.431
Yeah, about a year ago.

47:48.432 --> 47:51.400
A lot of faces, but you...
you were there, yeah?

47:51.401 --> 47:53.269
Yeah, I don't know.

47:53.270 --> 47:55.538
You know how Duffy's parties
are, man, they're crazy.

47:55.539 --> 47:59.644
Yeah yeah, unfortunately I do
know how Duffy's parties are.

48:04.982 --> 48:08.351
So, is that your car?

48:08.352 --> 48:10.820
- Yeah.
- Piece of shit.

48:10.821 --> 48:12.655
What the fuck?

48:12.656 --> 48:15.258
Hey, watch out now.
That's my girl.

48:15.259 --> 48:18.527
Gets me from point "a"
to point "B," you know?

48:18.528 --> 48:20.598
So did you rob me?

48:25.335 --> 48:27.370
I'm sorry?

48:27.371 --> 48:29.440
Did you rob me that night?

48:30.741 --> 48:32.742
You know,
'cause if you robbed me,

48:32.743 --> 48:34.777
I'm not talking to you anymore.

48:34.778 --> 48:38.481
No, as I recall
it was you who robbed me.

48:38.482 --> 48:41.717
Oh no, that wouldn't be me. I'm
usually the sucker at the table.

48:41.718 --> 48:45.756
I'm Lewis, Duffy's brother.

48:53.664 --> 48:55.631
Lewis.

48:55.632 --> 48:58.334
Shit, Lewis. Yeah, man,
I remember you now.

48:58.335 --> 49:00.803
- I'm sorry, Lewis.
- You know my name.

49:00.804 --> 49:04.473
Yeah. Yeah, sometimes I
forget my own name, Lewis.

49:04.474 --> 49:07.443
Oh, hey, yeah,
I know all about that.

49:07.444 --> 49:10.046
So you want to come in
and catch up?

49:10.047 --> 49:12.748
No.

49:12.749 --> 49:14.383
Come on, I got omelets in there.

49:14.384 --> 49:16.752
We got all kinds of fruit,
wines... really good stuff.

49:16.753 --> 49:20.690
No, really I shouldn't. You know,
I was just in the neighborhood,

49:20.691 --> 49:22.358
thought I'd come by and say hi.

49:22.359 --> 49:23.726
You're from out of town?

49:23.727 --> 49:25.796
Yeah, kind of, Lewis.

49:27.564 --> 49:30.399
You want to know
what he was doing in there?

49:30.400 --> 49:31.967
Excuse me?

49:31.968 --> 49:34.438
You want to see her?

49:38.542 --> 49:40.378
Come on.

49:48.919 --> 49:53.456
Is she a killer or what?

49:53.457 --> 49:55.358
I don't know about you,

49:55.359 --> 49:57.560
but I think that's the most
beautiful rear end on an automobile

49:57.561 --> 49:59.497
that I've ever seen.

50:01.144 --> 50:03.566
You should leave.
I'll take care of everything.

50:03.567 --> 50:06.569
I really don't feel comfortable
leaving you here with all this.

50:06.570 --> 50:08.838
But you're not impressed.

50:08.839 --> 50:11.741
It's nice.
It's awesome, yeah.

50:11.742 --> 50:14.845
Yeah. You get in a
fight or something?

50:17.647 --> 50:20.785
You got fresh scratches
on your neck.

50:25.155 --> 50:27.423
Oh man, no.

50:27.424 --> 50:29.392
I was...

50:29.393 --> 50:30.526
She was an animal, right?

50:30.527 --> 50:32.128
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

50:32.129 --> 50:34.029
Yeah, a real tigress.

50:34.030 --> 50:36.899
- Cougar.
- Cougar. That's what... yeah.

50:36.900 --> 50:39.101
Yeah.

50:39.102 --> 50:41.670
You know I...
to tell you the truth,

50:41.671 --> 50:43.806
I don't give
a rat's ass about cars.

50:43.807 --> 50:47.476
You know, as long as it... as it
runs, that's all I care about.

50:47.477 --> 50:51.582
All this is overcompensation
as far as I'm concerned.

50:57.821 --> 51:00.491
Come on, let me
fix you something to eat.

51:03.760 --> 51:06.162
There she is!

51:06.163 --> 51:08.597
Where's the puppy?
Where's the poo-poo?

51:08.598 --> 51:11.600
Come here.

51:11.601 --> 51:13.969
Hey, look at that.

51:13.970 --> 51:15.971
Normally she'd be
barking her head off.

51:15.972 --> 51:18.474
She didn't have any time
for anybody but me and Duffy.

51:18.475 --> 51:21.610
Yeah, this is joy.

51:21.611 --> 51:25.648
Yeah. She's a product
of hard love.

51:25.649 --> 51:27.755
Remember when I told you
about hard love?

51:31.655 --> 51:34.024
Come on.
I'll fix you a drink.

51:37.227 --> 51:41.065
Did, did Duffy tell you
when he'd be back from his trip?

51:47.571 --> 51:49.672
I never knew he left, Lewis.

51:49.673 --> 51:52.508
Me neither.

51:52.509 --> 51:55.679
Great communication, huh?

51:58.615 --> 52:02.218
You know, I... I really shouldn't drink.
I gotta be at work.

52:02.219 --> 52:04.086
I was supposed to be there
right now.

52:04.087 --> 52:05.521
I was just kinda
on my lunch break, you know.

52:05.522 --> 52:07.022
On lunch?

52:07.023 --> 52:09.024
Well here, enjoy the fruit part

52:09.025 --> 52:11.662
of your nutritional pyramid,
my friend.

52:24.975 --> 52:26.977
Sit down.

52:34.184 --> 52:36.654
You're kind of a quiet guy, huh?

52:38.688 --> 52:40.189
No, not really.

52:40.190 --> 52:41.992
What do you say we cut the shit?

52:43.293 --> 52:46.729
You want to know what
the bet is, hot shot?

52:46.730 --> 52:49.066
Did Duffy go back to gambling?

52:50.667 --> 52:52.870
I don't know.

52:55.205 --> 52:56.839
Don't lie to me.

52:56.840 --> 52:58.742
Okay.

53:00.010 --> 53:04.747
Hey, what do you say?
Hey... hey, sweetheart!

53:04.748 --> 53:06.982
Come on down here. There's an
old friend of duff's here.

53:06.983 --> 53:08.684
<i>I want you to meet him.</i>

53:08.685 --> 53:10.953
Did you ever meet her?
No, you wouldn't have.

53:10.954 --> 53:12.990
She's a recent acquisition.

53:15.158 --> 53:18.829
Hey, we're gonna have a drink by the pool.
Come on, join us.

53:20.664 --> 53:22.666
Pool's this way.

53:25.602 --> 53:26.770
Yeah.

53:35.645 --> 53:39.783
So... where did you
and Duffy meet?

53:43.053 --> 53:44.753
Casino.

53:44.754 --> 53:46.355
- Casino.
- Yes.

53:46.356 --> 53:49.409
You know, let's give him a call right now.
What do you say?

53:50.184 --> 53:52.027
<i>How'd you like
to make some dollars?</i>

53:52.028 --> 53:54.063
<i>- Do it!
- Do you have any idea</i>

53:54.064 --> 53:56.231
<i>of the kind of people
we're dealing with?</i>

53:56.232 --> 53:58.867
No. No,
that's not a good idea.

53:58.868 --> 54:02.271
<i>- Yeah, I'm sure he's dying to hear from me.
- No no.</i>

54:02.272 --> 54:04.041
He's probably busy.

54:06.076 --> 54:08.143
Take off that hat.

54:08.144 --> 54:10.748
I feel like
I'm talking to rocky.

54:16.119 --> 54:18.756
Straight to voicemail,
go figure.

54:24.894 --> 54:28.165
So, Jack, refresh my memory.
What is it you do?

54:33.136 --> 54:34.837
That's a good question.

54:34.838 --> 54:36.740
I bet you got a good answer.

54:43.813 --> 54:45.848
How do you know my name, Lewis?

54:45.849 --> 54:48.250
You told me.

54:48.251 --> 54:50.886
Yeah, you did. You told me... you
said, "Jack Daniel, like the drink."

54:50.887 --> 54:52.788
And I said,
"a damn good one at that."

54:52.789 --> 54:55.726
- No, I didn't.
- Yeah, you did.

54:56.793 --> 55:00.831
On poker night, remember?

55:06.202 --> 55:07.838
I think I should go.

55:08.872 --> 55:10.140
Okay.

55:15.045 --> 55:17.314
Thanks for the drink.

55:18.948 --> 55:21.085
Bye bye.

55:23.053 --> 55:25.389
I'll see you around, Jack.

55:32.729 --> 55:35.766
"Out out, brief candle."

55:37.167 --> 55:40.903
Roll down the window.

55:40.904 --> 55:43.906
God damn it.

55:43.907 --> 55:46.809
- Oh my God.
- Sorry.

55:46.810 --> 55:49.278
Why did you come here?

55:49.279 --> 55:51.046
The laundromat
by my house was closed.

55:51.047 --> 55:52.915
You left this.

55:52.916 --> 55:53.982
Oh, jeez, there it is.

55:53.983 --> 55:56.118
I took care of it.

55:56.119 --> 55:58.053
Yeah, how?

55:58.054 --> 56:00.089
I went to the desert yesterday
and I buried him.

56:00.090 --> 56:01.258
Ooh, that's original.

56:02.926 --> 56:04.893
Lewis knows what happened.

56:04.894 --> 56:07.062
I can feel it, Jack.
He has to disappear.

56:07.063 --> 56:08.397
Slow down there, tiger.

56:08.398 --> 56:10.065
You've been watching
too many gangster movies.

56:10.066 --> 56:12.201
No, I'm serious. I'm talking
about our lives here.

56:12.202 --> 56:15.518
You have no idea... the person
that you were just in there with.

56:16.740 --> 56:18.440
What are you doing?

56:18.441 --> 56:20.843
Jack, listen to me.
I buried him for you, okay?

56:20.844 --> 56:22.111
I'm saving your life.

56:22.112 --> 56:26.281
I saved you!
Oh, great, now I owe you?

56:26.282 --> 56:27.950
Shit, I don't even know
you're name.

56:27.951 --> 56:30.185
Listen, Lewis despises me.
He always has, okay?

56:30.186 --> 56:31.787
And he scares me.

56:31.788 --> 56:33.956
If he has any idea
that we have something to do

56:33.957 --> 56:35.357
with the disappearance
of his brother,

56:35.358 --> 56:36.859
there's no telling
what he will do, Jack.

56:36.860 --> 56:38.761
Don't worry about it.

56:38.762 --> 56:41.063
Get out before you get us both killed.
Okay? How about that?

56:41.064 --> 56:43.033
Okay.

56:44.868 --> 56:47.136
What is it, locked?

56:47.137 --> 56:49.972
Oh, man.
You are a piece of work.

56:49.973 --> 56:52.007
You haven't seen anything yet.

56:52.008 --> 56:54.978
All right. You couldn't wipe
your ass with both hands.

56:56.146 --> 56:58.882
Fucking... unbelievable.

57:11.828 --> 57:14.031
Beautiful day for a swim.

57:15.965 --> 57:19.970
Careful out there.
There's no lifeguard on duty.

01:00:40.136 --> 01:00:43.171
Hey, Zeke, there's a chump
on his way up here.

01:00:43.172 --> 01:00:45.240
Give him that card
and let him in, okay?

01:00:45.241 --> 01:00:48.345
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you.

01:01:01.624 --> 01:01:03.627
Would you like to come in?

01:01:05.528 --> 01:01:08.063
It is the only door up here.

01:01:08.064 --> 01:01:10.100
I believe that's for you.

01:01:11.334 --> 01:01:13.502
That's not mine.

01:01:13.503 --> 01:01:16.106
Oh, yeah, it is.
Look at that.

01:01:17.807 --> 01:01:20.010
Come on in, Jack.

01:01:21.310 --> 01:01:23.645
Nice.

01:01:23.646 --> 01:01:27.082
Not nice enough.

01:01:27.083 --> 01:01:29.584
<i>That's bullshit.</i>

01:01:29.585 --> 01:01:33.488
<i>Looks like 99% have been
waiting on a spade.</i>

01:01:33.489 --> 01:01:35.557
Fuckin' serious?

01:01:35.558 --> 01:01:38.560
Oh, yeah. Boy, was I
glad to see that Jack.

01:01:38.561 --> 01:01:41.830
Not you, asshole.
The Jack of spades.

01:01:41.831 --> 01:01:43.632
<i>Are you serious?</i>

01:01:43.633 --> 01:01:47.469
Oh, ay! Oh, ay!
Mr. fuckin' balboa.

01:01:47.470 --> 01:01:50.439
You're about the worst tail
I've ever seen in my life,

01:01:50.440 --> 01:01:52.174
you know that?

01:01:52.175 --> 01:01:54.409
In that car you might as well
be driving a fucking bus.

01:01:54.410 --> 01:01:56.745
Excuse me, gentlemen.

01:01:56.746 --> 01:02:01.116
What'd I tell you
about this stupid hat?

01:02:01.117 --> 01:02:03.285
I don't know.
I wasn't listening.

01:02:03.286 --> 01:02:05.522
I'm just trying
to lighten things up, man.

01:02:07.223 --> 01:02:09.458
So what are
we doing here, Lewis?

01:02:09.459 --> 01:02:13.195
I think the question is
what are you doing here, Jack?

01:02:13.196 --> 01:02:15.297
Well, I think I know.

01:02:15.298 --> 01:02:18.133
You want to know what do and, more
importantly, you want to know what I know.

01:02:18.134 --> 01:02:19.701
Is that right?

01:02:19.702 --> 01:02:22.492
Well, why don't you just ask me, Jack?
What do I know?

01:02:23.473 --> 01:02:25.207
About what happened
to my brother.

01:02:25.208 --> 01:02:27.544
I don't know.
You tell me what happened.

01:02:29.412 --> 01:02:31.613
If you're trying
to protect her, don't.

01:02:31.614 --> 01:02:33.281
I'm not.

01:02:33.282 --> 01:02:34.684
Don't bullshit me.

01:02:40.556 --> 01:02:42.290
They started fighting.
I left.

01:02:42.291 --> 01:02:43.725
I don't know
what happened after that.

01:02:43.726 --> 01:02:47.629
Maybe, maybe somebody else
went over there after I left.

01:02:47.630 --> 01:02:49.231
You ever think of that?

01:02:49.232 --> 01:02:51.299
Somebody went over there
at 5:00 in the fucking morning

01:02:51.300 --> 01:02:53.301
after you left?

01:02:53.302 --> 01:02:56.404
So you think I had something
to do with it? Okay.

01:02:56.405 --> 01:02:59.474
Hang on, hang on. Don't go anywhere.
I wanna show you something.

01:02:59.475 --> 01:03:03.178
These things are amazing.
You got one of these yet?

01:03:03.179 --> 01:03:05.247
It was a gift from a client.

01:03:05.248 --> 01:03:08.250
It seems like
I found the black box.

01:03:08.251 --> 01:03:10.353
You know, the one
from the accident.

01:03:13.289 --> 01:03:16.291
Aw, don't look like that, Jack.

01:03:16.292 --> 01:03:18.193
I suppose
that it could be argued

01:03:18.194 --> 01:03:20.195
in some courts of law
that it was self-defense,

01:03:20.196 --> 01:03:23.465
even if you were
fucking the man's wife.

01:03:23.466 --> 01:03:25.700
The little damsel in distress.

01:03:25.701 --> 01:03:27.802
<i>Well, she can
take care of herself.</i>

01:03:27.803 --> 01:03:31.206
Oh yes, she can, absolutely.
She's proven that.

01:03:31.207 --> 01:03:33.308
The question is, who's going to
take care of little Stephanie?

01:03:33.309 --> 01:03:36.213
<i>That's who I'd be worried
about if I were you, Jack.</i>

01:03:39.248 --> 01:03:41.383
I'm sorry.

01:03:41.384 --> 01:03:45.453
But I know all about you,
your kid, your wife,

01:03:45.454 --> 01:03:47.255
your debts.

01:03:47.256 --> 01:03:50.559
That shit's easy. That's just
a couple of phone calls.

01:03:50.560 --> 01:03:54.563
What exactly is it
that you do, Lewis?

01:03:54.564 --> 01:03:56.932
I paint things
between a hard place

01:03:56.933 --> 01:03:58.200
and a harder place.

01:03:58.201 --> 01:03:59.935
And not to toot my own horn,

01:03:59.936 --> 01:04:01.303
but I'm a regular
fucking Picasso

01:04:01.304 --> 01:04:03.806
and I'm about
to paint my masterpiece.

01:04:05.942 --> 01:04:08.310
<i>- Your hot tea, Lewis.
- Oh, thanks, sweetheart.</i>

01:04:08.311 --> 01:04:10.147
You're welcome.

01:04:18.862 --> 01:04:21.389
- What do you want?
- All right, here's the deal.

01:04:21.390 --> 01:04:23.592
Duff was blood by default.

01:04:23.593 --> 01:04:26.595
He was a selfish prick who
wanted everything for himself.

01:04:26.596 --> 01:04:28.396
Can you believe that?
My own brother?

01:04:28.397 --> 01:04:31.466
<i>You know, actually you
did me a huge favor,</i>

01:04:31.467 --> 01:04:34.869
and I'll bet money that you
did her a nice solid too.

01:04:34.870 --> 01:04:36.938
Well, that's good.

01:04:36.939 --> 01:04:38.807
I did you a favor.
We're even then, right?

01:04:38.808 --> 01:04:40.408
No.
No, we're not even.

01:04:40.409 --> 01:04:42.477
You're gonna do me
another favor.

01:04:42.478 --> 01:04:45.382
Like what?

01:04:46.649 --> 01:04:49.252
You're going to kill the bitch.

01:04:57.793 --> 01:04:59.761
What if I disappear?

01:04:59.762 --> 01:05:03.300
If you can, you should.

01:05:05.117 --> 01:05:07.802
But I gotta tell you,
I got better eyes than you do,

01:05:07.803 --> 01:05:12.375
I got better ears than you do, and
I got one hell of a loyal staff.

01:05:14.877 --> 01:05:18.546
So let me clear up any
lingering doubts you may have.

01:05:18.547 --> 01:05:20.548
If you want to live,

01:05:20.549 --> 01:05:24.753
if you want those
that you care about to live,

01:05:24.754 --> 01:05:26.489
<i>you'll do this.</i>

01:05:29.358 --> 01:05:30.727
Think about it.

01:05:32.428 --> 01:05:34.431
<i>It's a really good deal.</i>

01:05:39.302 --> 01:05:42.305
We'll talk soon.

01:05:52.548 --> 01:05:55.417
<i>Don't lie to me.</i>

01:05:55.418 --> 01:05:57.619
<i>I know all about you.</i>

01:05:57.620 --> 01:05:59.454
<i>I know about your wife.</i>

01:05:59.455 --> 01:06:01.756
<i>I know about your debts.
That shit's easy.</i>

01:06:01.757 --> 01:06:04.757
<i>Question is, who's going to
take care of little Stephanie?</i>

01:06:06.529 --> 01:06:09.214
<i>That's who I'd be worried
about if I were you, Jack.</i>

01:06:09.765 --> 01:06:12.500
<i>I'll be goddamned
if some street-walking whore</i>

01:06:12.501 --> 01:06:14.769
<i>is going to walk away
with my father's fortune.</i>

01:06:14.770 --> 01:06:17.440
<i>If you're trying
to protect her, don't.</i>

01:06:18.541 --> 01:06:20.977
<i>You're going to kill the bitch.</i>

01:06:22.345 --> 01:06:23.912
<i>If you want to live,</i>

01:06:23.913 --> 01:06:27.415
<i>if you want those
that you care about to live,</i>

01:06:27.416 --> 01:06:28.985
<i>you'll do this.</i>

01:07:00.583 --> 01:07:01.751
Come on.

01:07:06.722 --> 01:07:08.423
What are you doing?

01:07:08.424 --> 01:07:09.657
I was letting myself in.

01:07:09.658 --> 01:07:10.792
How'd you do that?

01:07:10.793 --> 01:07:12.660
It was open.
I was worried about you.

01:07:12.661 --> 01:07:15.432
- Are you okay?
- It was open?

01:07:16.599 --> 01:07:18.400
Oh fuck.

01:07:18.401 --> 01:07:20.704
<i>Wasn't smart.</i>

01:07:22.805 --> 01:07:24.441
You know I could've killed you.

01:07:31.147 --> 01:07:33.047
What are you gonna do?

01:07:33.048 --> 01:07:35.817
What, am I going to kill you?

01:07:35.818 --> 01:07:37.554
Should I?

01:07:43.526 --> 01:07:46.029
I just came
to see if you were okay.

01:07:55.004 --> 01:07:58.708
What have you gotten me into?

01:08:04.547 --> 01:08:05.815
Huh?

01:08:29.904 --> 01:08:31.741
<i>It's may.</i>

01:08:33.242 --> 01:08:34.343
My name.

01:08:38.546 --> 01:08:40.715
May.

01:08:40.716 --> 01:08:43.486
That's a pretty name
for a pretty girl.

01:08:45.587 --> 01:08:49.125
So tell me, did you
ever really love Duffy?

01:08:52.127 --> 01:08:54.798
Yes, I did...

01:08:55.798 --> 01:08:57.466
At first.

01:09:01.770 --> 01:09:04.506
He was... charming.

01:09:06.942 --> 01:09:08.877
There was something kind
about him.

01:09:10.912 --> 01:09:13.515
And what happened?

01:09:13.515 --> 01:09:15.084
He changed.

01:09:18.621 --> 01:09:20.721
Started watching
everything I did,

01:09:20.723 --> 01:09:22.689
everywhere I went.

01:09:22.691 --> 01:09:25.962
He said that he made me...

01:09:27.863 --> 01:09:29.566
That he owned me.

01:09:30.566 --> 01:09:32.769
<i>I was afraid of him.</i>

01:09:34.636 --> 01:09:38.541
I'm on wife ♪4.

01:09:41.381 --> 01:09:43.645
<i>You're ready to do something
behind my back.</i>

01:09:43.645 --> 01:09:47.582
Tell me, Jack, just what is that?
What is that?

01:09:47.582 --> 01:09:50.478
Somebody went over there at
5:00 in the fucking morning?

01:09:53.087 --> 01:09:55.256
Go home, may.

01:09:55.257 --> 01:09:58.127
I'm gonna take care of all this.

01:10:02.097 --> 01:10:03.666
How?

01:10:06.869 --> 01:10:09.672
Just go home.
I'll handle it.

01:10:49.645 --> 01:10:52.714
Hey.
Carl around?

01:10:52.715 --> 01:10:54.816
Yeah, he's in the back
in the gym.

01:10:54.817 --> 01:10:56.718
All right, thank you.

01:10:56.719 --> 01:10:58.254
What's up, dude?

01:11:07.963 --> 01:11:10.033
Timing, timing.

01:11:13.402 --> 01:11:16.671
Excuse me.
Hey, guys.

01:11:16.672 --> 01:11:18.239
You gotta be kidding me.

01:11:18.240 --> 01:11:20.710
- Fellas.
- Frank.

01:11:21.498 --> 01:11:23.077
You must have grown some balls

01:11:23.078 --> 01:11:25.815
or you're just plain fucking
stupid coming here, son.

01:11:27.650 --> 01:11:29.151
You've come to buy a car?

01:11:31.353 --> 01:11:33.856
Well, where's my package?

01:11:35.257 --> 01:11:38.363
I don't... I don't have your
money, if that's what you mean.

01:11:39.361 --> 01:11:40.495
This guy, man.

01:11:40.496 --> 01:11:43.097
So you don't have my money,
you don't want to buy a car.

01:11:43.098 --> 01:11:44.783
What the fuck do you want, Jack?

01:11:45.934 --> 01:11:47.969
I want to talk to Paulie.

01:11:47.970 --> 01:11:49.606
You are talking to Paulie.

01:11:50.939 --> 01:11:53.834
Everything that goes through
him has to come through me.

01:11:54.743 --> 01:11:57.745
With all due respect, I...

01:11:57.746 --> 01:12:00.381
I got to talk to him alone.

01:12:00.382 --> 01:12:04.318
All due respect?
All due respect?

01:12:04.319 --> 01:12:07.722
I'll give you some advice, Jack.

01:12:07.723 --> 01:12:09.757
Get the fuck out of here.

01:12:09.758 --> 01:12:11.859
You heard him,
get the fuck out of here.

01:12:11.860 --> 01:12:13.795
And get my money, Jack.

01:12:13.796 --> 01:12:16.731
- Dumb-ass.
- Let's get back to it.

01:12:16.732 --> 01:12:19.734
Carl, please, Carl.

01:12:19.735 --> 01:12:23.438
Let me talk to him for just...
just for a second.

01:12:23.439 --> 01:12:25.173
Please.

01:12:25.174 --> 01:12:27.076
All right, Jack.

01:12:28.377 --> 01:12:31.714
But you've just signed
your own death warrant.

01:12:47.362 --> 01:12:50.131
You know, Jack, I...

01:12:50.132 --> 01:12:51.866
I feel like maybe

01:12:51.867 --> 01:12:55.336
you're not here
to give me my money,

01:12:55.337 --> 01:12:59.273
but you want to talk to me.
I can feel it.

01:12:59.274 --> 01:13:02.944
I'm in a lot of trouble.

01:13:02.945 --> 01:13:05.179
Something terrible has happened.

01:13:05.180 --> 01:13:07.014
Yeah, like what?

01:13:07.015 --> 01:13:11.519
I... put a man
to sleep...

01:13:11.520 --> 01:13:13.020
For good.

01:13:13.021 --> 01:13:16.958
It was a total fucking
accident, I swear.

01:13:16.959 --> 01:13:18.292
<i>- An accident?
- Yeah.</i>

01:13:18.293 --> 01:13:19.527
<i>Shit happens.</i>

01:13:19.528 --> 01:13:21.896
The first time
I fucking killed a guy,

01:13:21.897 --> 01:13:24.332
it was kind of an accident too.

01:13:24.333 --> 01:13:28.469
<i>I was just trying
to talk to this guy, you know?</i>

01:13:28.470 --> 01:13:31.839
And he really wasn't
in the mood to talk,

01:13:31.840 --> 01:13:35.376
and so I had to get
a little bit rough with him.

01:13:35.377 --> 01:13:38.412
And then,

01:13:38.413 --> 01:13:41.916
I guess...

01:13:41.917 --> 01:13:44.852
He passed, you know?

01:13:44.853 --> 01:13:47.088
I had to throw him in the trunk.

01:13:47.089 --> 01:13:50.291
<i>But by me killing
this fucking guy,</i>

01:13:50.292 --> 01:13:53.494
I wasn't following orders.
What'd I do?

01:13:53.495 --> 01:13:57.165
I left this fucking guy
in the trunk

01:13:57.166 --> 01:13:58.933
for a long time.

01:13:58.934 --> 01:14:01.002
That's why they call you
Paulie trunks?

01:14:01.003 --> 01:14:03.805
Yeah. You're quick.
That's right.

01:14:03.806 --> 01:14:07.842
I don't... I don't know
how I got into all this mess.

01:14:07.843 --> 01:14:11.579
A woman.
And what is this woman's name?

01:14:11.580 --> 01:14:13.247
May.

01:14:13.248 --> 01:14:15.183
May? May what?

01:14:15.184 --> 01:14:18.886
I don't...
I don't know, Seglio?

01:14:18.887 --> 01:14:21.758
Seg... Seglo?
Something like that.

01:14:27.329 --> 01:14:30.331
You fucked Duffy's wife?

01:14:30.332 --> 01:14:32.835
Well, no, I...
no, I didn't fuck her.

01:14:32.868 --> 01:14:34.869
I just... we just
messed around a little bit.

01:14:34.870 --> 01:14:36.237
You messed around
with another...

01:14:36.238 --> 01:14:38.406
you know, where we come from,

01:14:38.407 --> 01:14:40.474
that's a death sentence,
you know that?

01:14:40.475 --> 01:14:44.946
I myself would kill anybody
who did that.

01:14:44.947 --> 01:14:46.983
I understand that.

01:14:47.883 --> 01:14:50.484
And that's a good rule.
I get it.

01:14:50.485 --> 01:14:52.887
<i>But you didn't fuck her,</i>

01:14:52.888 --> 01:14:57.091
and Duffy
has a certain propensity

01:14:57.092 --> 01:15:00.895
for doing this kind of shit
to other people.

01:15:00.896 --> 01:15:04.031
Yeah,
his weird-ass brother, too.

01:15:04.032 --> 01:15:05.967
Yeah. Lewis?

01:15:05.968 --> 01:15:10.039
Yeah, now that crazy
motherfucker wants me...

01:15:11.073 --> 01:15:13.943
To kill her for him.

01:15:15.944 --> 01:15:18.446
<i>Madon, madon, madon.</i>

01:15:18.447 --> 01:15:20.181
What about a piece?

01:15:20.182 --> 01:15:21.549
A piece of what?

01:15:21.550 --> 01:15:24.086
You know, you know...

01:15:25.087 --> 01:15:26.220
A thing.

01:15:26.221 --> 01:15:28.089
A thing?

01:15:28.090 --> 01:15:31.959
I got plenty of fucking things.
What kind of thing you want?

01:15:31.960 --> 01:15:35.363
A gun.
I need a fucking gun.

01:15:35.364 --> 01:15:36.998
Oh.

01:15:36.999 --> 01:15:39.066
- You want a gun?
- Yeah.

01:15:39.067 --> 01:15:40.534
You a tough guy now?

01:15:40.535 --> 01:15:42.069
<i>Let me ask you something.</i>

01:15:42.070 --> 01:15:44.941
<i>Do I look like
a fucking pawnbroker to you?</i>

01:15:46.909 --> 01:15:49.412
<i>I got nowhere else to go.</i>

01:15:59.988 --> 01:16:03.057
Make sure you get this

01:16:03.058 --> 01:16:06.093
into Lewis's hands, you hear?

01:16:06.094 --> 01:16:07.962
<i>All right?</i>

01:16:07.963 --> 01:16:12.033
You know, when you
give a piece to somebody,

01:16:12.034 --> 01:16:15.872
you start to then find out
who your real friends are.

01:16:18.440 --> 01:16:20.574
- Are you my friend?
- Yes, sir.

01:16:20.575 --> 01:16:22.044
Yeah.

01:16:40.395 --> 01:16:42.163
I should put it in...

01:16:42.164 --> 01:16:45.032
- no, you might blow your dick off.
- Oh yeah.

01:16:45.033 --> 01:16:48.302
I'll put it
in the back. Right.

01:16:48.303 --> 01:16:51.073
- Get out of here.
- Yes sir. Thank you.

01:17:24.139 --> 01:17:25.339
May, you in here?

01:17:25.340 --> 01:17:27.141
Jack, what are you doing here?

01:17:27.142 --> 01:17:29.343
I told you I'm going
to take care of this.

01:17:29.344 --> 01:17:31.412
I didn't think
you were going to come back.

01:17:31.413 --> 01:17:33.647
Yeah, well, surprise surprise.

01:17:33.648 --> 01:17:36.017
- You going somewhere?
- We're going somewhere.

01:17:36.018 --> 01:17:38.419
- We have to lay low.
- Just stay in your room.

01:17:38.420 --> 01:17:41.655
I told you
I'm gonna handle this shit.

01:17:41.656 --> 01:17:43.459
Just stay there, don't come out.

01:17:55.804 --> 01:17:57.436
You gonna kill me now, asshole?

01:18:03.245 --> 01:18:04.612
Not now, motherfucker.

01:18:04.613 --> 01:18:06.048
You fuckin'...!

01:18:40.715 --> 01:18:42.184
Lewis.

01:18:49.691 --> 01:18:52.228
Fuck you!

01:19:03.271 --> 01:19:05.441
It's... it's over, may.
Put the gun down.

01:19:10.145 --> 01:19:13.547
May, he's unconscious.

01:19:13.548 --> 01:19:16.085
Put the fucking gun down.

01:19:17.486 --> 01:19:19.320
Oh, Jack.

01:19:19.321 --> 01:19:21.388
<i>I'll take it from here.</i>

01:19:21.389 --> 01:19:24.260
I really, truly am sorry.

01:19:25.427 --> 01:19:28.395
Pull the trigger, may.

01:19:28.396 --> 01:19:30.833
You're so pathetic, honey.
Don't beg.

01:19:33.268 --> 01:19:34.536
Goodbye, Jack.

01:19:53.555 --> 01:19:55.391
Holy shit.

01:20:20.215 --> 01:20:21.949
Get rid of this for me.

01:20:21.950 --> 01:20:24.185
What am I, David Copperfield?

01:20:24.186 --> 01:20:25.488
Yeah.

01:20:27.689 --> 01:20:29.924
I'll let you live
under one condition,

01:20:29.925 --> 01:20:31.392
you get the fuck out of here.

01:20:31.393 --> 01:20:33.762
I don't want to see you
again, you understand?

01:20:35.263 --> 01:20:37.366
Do you understand me?

01:20:40.302 --> 01:20:42.303
Yeah, I... I understand.

01:20:42.304 --> 01:20:44.405
All right,
get the fuck out of here.

01:20:44.406 --> 01:20:46.674
- Yeah, yeah.
- You're welcome.

01:20:46.675 --> 01:20:48.409
Thank you.

01:20:48.410 --> 01:20:50.544
I'll take that, Jack.

01:20:50.545 --> 01:20:54.383
And, Jack, don't forget
about that death warrant.

01:21:35.457 --> 01:21:38.892
Okay, killer, stay here
and watch this bag.

01:21:38.893 --> 01:21:41.929
I'm going to go say goodbye
to some old friends, okay?

01:21:41.930 --> 01:21:43.465
I'll be right back.

01:21:50.505 --> 01:21:53.342
How's that Viagra
working out for you?

01:21:54.976 --> 01:21:57.444
Hey, Jack, the usual?

01:21:57.445 --> 01:21:59.348
No.

01:22:00.715 --> 01:22:02.818
No, not today, buddy.

01:22:06.921 --> 01:22:08.924
You know, you look like shit.

01:22:10.959 --> 01:22:13.796
Yeah, look at you.

01:22:18.066 --> 01:22:20.501
I'm not going to be
playing cards anymore, Oscar.

01:22:20.502 --> 01:22:24.405
And I've been asked
to leave town, tonight,

01:22:24.406 --> 01:22:26.707
for good. That's it.

01:22:26.708 --> 01:22:28.944
What are you doing here then?

01:22:31.313 --> 01:22:33.482
I came to say goodbye to you...

01:22:35.450 --> 01:22:37.651
And thank you
for trying to get me

01:22:37.652 --> 01:22:40.022
<i>to quit gambling
all these years.</i>

01:22:41.790 --> 01:22:44.026
I wish I'd listened to you.

01:22:45.927 --> 01:22:48.364
Good luck out there, man.

01:22:52.734 --> 01:22:54.403
Thank you.

01:22:58.840 --> 01:23:00.476
Thanks, man.

01:23:04.646 --> 01:23:07.815
- Stacey, my favorite waitress.
- Jack, what happened to you?

01:23:07.816 --> 01:23:10.519
I was breaking up
a bank robbery.

01:23:12.387 --> 01:23:13.821
This is for you.

01:23:13.822 --> 01:23:16.557
It's for forgetting your name
all these years.

01:23:16.558 --> 01:23:19.393
This is it.

01:23:19.394 --> 01:23:21.528
I'll see you down
the road, okay?

01:23:21.529 --> 01:23:24.431
Sweetie, get me a gin and tonic.

01:23:24.432 --> 01:23:29.103
Jesus, Jack,
what happened to you, man?

01:23:29.104 --> 01:23:31.605
You don't want to hear it.

01:23:31.606 --> 01:23:34.410
Good luck to you, Jack.

01:23:42.851 --> 01:23:45.452
<i>Stephanie, honey, get the door.</i>

01:23:45.453 --> 01:23:47.621
Mom, can you get it?

01:23:47.622 --> 01:23:51.060
<i>No, Stephanie, get the door,
I'm in the middle of something.</i>

01:23:55.597 --> 01:23:58.901
Stephanie, that better be
homework you're doing.

01:24:07.041 --> 01:24:09.845
