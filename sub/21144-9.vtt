WEBVTT

00:01.985 --> 00:02.675
- Hey, guys! I'm Paige.
- I'm Frankie.

00:02.711 --> 00:04.102
Both: And we're Bizaardvark!

00:04.137 --> 00:06.605
Today we are doing
the Multi-Task Challenge,

00:06.640 --> 00:08.309
where we see if we can do
two things at once.

00:08.333 --> 00:10.016
Jumping on a trampoline

00:10.052 --> 00:11.651
while painting a picture
of a dog, go!

00:11.686 --> 00:14.655
Okay. Uh, that's the ears...

00:14.690 --> 00:16.342
I don't know if I made
enough room for the face.

00:16.366 --> 00:18.024
I'm still jumping.

00:18.060 --> 00:19.504
- Okay. There it is!
- (both giggling)

00:19.528 --> 00:21.377
Oh, wow!

00:21.413 --> 00:22.624
Frankie: You can tell
that's a dog, right?

00:22.648 --> 00:24.347
- (bell dings)
- This is hard!

00:24.382 --> 00:26.024
I told you! What are
you trying to make?

00:26.059 --> 00:27.750
That looks like a bird!

00:27.786 --> 00:29.103
It's a giant cat!

00:29.138 --> 00:30.529
(both giggling)

00:30.564 --> 00:31.742
- (both scream)
- (buzzer sounds)

00:31.766 --> 00:33.665
Throwing darts
while Hula-Hooping!

00:33.701 --> 00:35.775
I am going to stand
over here. Come on.

00:35.811 --> 00:37.527
- (buzzer sounds)
- Okay.

00:37.563 --> 00:38.745
- (buzzer sounds)
- Aah!

00:38.780 --> 00:39.780
- No!
- (buzzer sounds)

00:41.600 --> 00:44.709
- Oh!
- (screams)

00:44.745 --> 00:46.231
(buzzer sounds) - Okay, I
just get a little too angry.

00:46.255 --> 00:47.287
You can do... (laughs)

00:47.322 --> 00:48.705
(both laughing)

00:50.843 --> 00:52.659
- (bell dings)
- (cheering)

00:52.694 --> 00:54.044
What?

00:55.523 --> 00:56.988
Dribbling a ball

00:57.023 --> 00:57.797
while putting on a
hooded raincoat.

00:57.833 --> 00:59.166
I'm gonna be over here,

00:59.201 --> 01:01.176
so I am not hurt.

01:01.211 --> 01:02.438
All right, I'm gonna
put my hood on first.

01:02.462 --> 01:04.545
Okay.

01:04.581 --> 01:06.924
You got this, okay.
Now try for the buttoning.

01:06.959 --> 01:08.424
How are you gonna
do the buttoning?

01:08.460 --> 01:09.654
I can't even see the buttons.
Think fast!

01:09.678 --> 01:13.255
(both screaming)

01:13.290 --> 01:14.934
Just gotta... Just gotta...
No, no, no, no, no!

01:14.958 --> 01:16.675
- (screams)
- (buzzer sounds)

01:16.710 --> 01:18.020
Okay, got a button,
got a button, got a button.

01:18.044 --> 01:19.213
- Paige: What?
- Got another button.

01:19.237 --> 01:20.628
Paige: How'd you do it so fast?

01:20.664 --> 01:22.305
Aah! My arm's a little tired.

01:22.340 --> 01:23.548
- I did it!

Frankie: All right,
listen up, people!

02:23.510 --> 02:25.994
As manager of the Vuuugle
softball team,

02:26.029 --> 02:28.130
it's my job to whip you
into shape!

02:28.165 --> 02:29.439
Did you volunteer to be manager

02:29.474 --> 02:30.223
just so you could
boss people around?

02:30.258 --> 02:32.209
No.

02:32.244 --> 02:33.613
I did it because they
gave me this whistle!

02:33.637 --> 02:34.769
(whistle trills)

02:36.882 --> 02:38.798
All right, our first game
is this weekend

02:38.833 --> 02:40.917
against Dave's
Discount Tire Store.

02:40.953 --> 02:43.412
I don't know who this Dave is,

02:43.414 --> 02:46.130
but I shall promptly give him
a funeral at sea!

02:46.166 --> 02:49.184
You're not a real Viking, Scott!

02:49.219 --> 02:51.427
And we know your dad
owns the store.

02:51.463 --> 02:54.789
What kind of man fires
his own son...

02:54.824 --> 02:56.344
(yelling) for yelling
at the customers!

02:57.995 --> 03:00.119
Those tire guys are big hitters.

03:00.155 --> 03:01.988
We're gonna need to hit
a ton of home runs.

03:02.023 --> 03:04.049
And I can't bat every time.

03:04.084 --> 03:06.310
You should bunt

03:06.386 --> 03:08.426
or get hit by a pitch
every time, like we discussed.

03:10.232 --> 03:11.672
We'll see what
the wind situation is.

03:13.576 --> 03:15.018
The weak child
makes a fair point.

03:17.230 --> 03:19.648
We need more muscle
to ensure victory!

03:20.925 --> 03:22.901
(grunts)

03:22.936 --> 03:25.278
And that's how you wheelbarrow
500 pounds of cement

03:25.314 --> 03:28.423
from Las Vegas to Los Angeles!

03:28.459 --> 03:30.909
Another extremely specific dare
completed! Woo!

03:30.944 --> 03:32.810
Woo!

03:32.846 --> 03:36.247
Wait. Dirk's back?

03:36.282 --> 03:38.274
We should ask him
to join our softball team.

03:38.309 --> 03:40.986
Oh, yeah, me and him
in the lineup?

03:41.021 --> 03:42.861
There's gonna be a lot
of trippies and doubies.

03:47.186 --> 03:49.052
Hey, Dirk. Do you wanna
join our softball team?

03:49.087 --> 03:50.596
Are you kidding?

03:50.631 --> 03:52.280
I love softball!

03:52.316 --> 03:53.982
Great, we're just
about to practice.

03:54.017 --> 03:56.393
Yes! Assemble the squadron!

03:58.122 --> 03:59.980
Oh. We're all here.

04:02.968 --> 04:05.026
All right, everyone.
Even though it's raining,

04:05.061 --> 04:06.948
we're not technically allowed
to be playing in here,

04:06.972 --> 04:08.692
- so if anyone asks...
- All: Bernie did it!

04:10.142 --> 04:11.733
Wow, we didn't even
practice that.

04:11.768 --> 04:13.326
And I don't know
why I said it, too.

04:16.681 --> 04:19.107
All right, Dirk's up.
Prepare to be dazzled.

04:19.143 --> 04:20.917
Way ahead of you.

04:39.888 --> 04:41.855
(bat clatters)

05:03.095 --> 05:05.512
This is what my people call...

05:05.547 --> 05:08.564
an awkward situation.

05:08.600 --> 05:11.893
There's no way
he can be on our team.

05:11.895 --> 05:14.988
Well, someone's gonna
have to look Dirk in the eye,

05:15.023 --> 05:17.349
tell him he's off the team,
and completely break his heart.

05:19.094 --> 05:21.919
You guys mind if I do it?

05:21.955 --> 05:26.616
Hey, hey, hang on. I know Dirk's big
and strong, but he's really sensitive.

05:26.693 --> 05:28.237
Remember that time he made
brownies and you said

05:28.261 --> 05:30.269
they were
"a little too chocolatey"?

05:30.305 --> 05:33.490
(crying) She said
they were too chocolatey!

05:35.928 --> 05:37.494
(laughs) He cried.

05:38.938 --> 05:40.521
Dirk's our friend.

05:40.556 --> 05:42.399
I'm gonna tell him the truth,

05:42.434 --> 05:45.877
- but I'm gonna let him down gently.
- Okay.

05:45.912 --> 05:49.406
- Hey, Dirk! Can I just...
- Hey, Paige, thanks again for inviting me.

05:49.441 --> 05:51.958
I've always wanted
to be on a softball team!

05:51.993 --> 05:54.085
Plus, with my best friends!

05:54.120 --> 05:55.578
So when's our first game?

05:55.613 --> 05:59.732
- Uh, actually...
- What is it, Paige?

05:59.767 --> 06:01.559
What is the actually?

06:03.280 --> 06:05.355
- What? Oh, hey!
- (chattering)

06:08.752 --> 06:11.594
So, um...

06:11.629 --> 06:13.997
They're actually canceling
the league this year

06:14.032 --> 06:19.077
because of... something.

06:19.113 --> 06:22.205
Oh, man! It's always something!

06:22.240 --> 06:25.875
That's too bad, because I made a
batch of brownies for the team!

06:27.687 --> 06:29.963
- You wanna try one?
- Sure.

06:29.998 --> 06:32.335
Last time I know you said they
were a little too chocolatey,

06:32.359 --> 06:34.926
so this batch I made
with just beans and raisins!

06:36.871 --> 06:38.263
So good!

06:44.337 --> 06:46.137
Hey, guys, I'm Bernie,
this is Dirk,

06:46.172 --> 06:47.588
and together, we're Birk.

06:47.624 --> 06:48.848
Or Dernie.

06:48.883 --> 06:51.218
Better!

06:51.253 --> 06:53.256
Today, we're gonna be doing
the Human Elephant Challenge,

06:53.280 --> 06:55.672
where we put some tennis balls
in these panty hose.

06:55.707 --> 06:57.406
(laughing)

06:57.442 --> 06:58.841
- Tennis balls! (Laughs)
- I know!

06:58.876 --> 07:01.778
We're gonna attach these to our
heads and swing 'em around

07:01.813 --> 07:03.363
like giant elephant trunks!

07:03.398 --> 07:04.839
Whoever knocks down
the most stuff

07:04.874 --> 07:05.815
with their trunk, wins.

07:05.850 --> 07:08.601
All right, so this is Bernie's
side, this is my side.

07:08.636 --> 07:10.153
Here we go!

07:10.188 --> 07:12.589
Bernie: Three, two, one, go!

07:19.298 --> 07:20.538
- Come here, penguin!
- (quacks)

07:22.701 --> 07:25.410
Yee-haw!

07:25.445 --> 07:26.703
Ow! No! Oh!

07:26.738 --> 07:28.012
Hey, let go!

07:28.047 --> 07:29.138
Quit turnin' em!

07:29.173 --> 07:31.032
- Hey!
- Oh! Oh!

07:31.067 --> 07:32.525
(elephant trumpeting)

07:36.247 --> 07:38.706
(cheering)

07:38.742 --> 07:41.467
- Great win, team!
- Yeah, too bad the umpire ejected you

07:41.503 --> 07:44.062
- after the first pitch.
- That ball was outside!

07:44.097 --> 07:46.217
He deserved everything I said
about his wife and kids.

07:49.102 --> 07:50.747
I should probably go prepare for my
hearing in front of the league board.

07:50.771 --> 07:52.520
Have fun.

07:52.556 --> 07:55.431
I still can't believe
I got five hits.

07:55.467 --> 07:59.552
You got to bat off the tee because
everyone thought you were under 10.

07:59.587 --> 08:04.065
The tee was set
at medium height, though.

08:04.101 --> 08:07.260
I'm just surprised the umpire let
Viking Guy bat with a real axe.

08:07.295 --> 08:09.479
Yes! He truly feared
for his life!

08:10.957 --> 08:12.607
Hey, guys!

08:12.642 --> 08:14.709
Oh!

08:14.745 --> 08:17.269
Hey, Dirk, what are
you doing here?

08:17.305 --> 08:20.473
I thought someone dared you
to stay at home

08:20.508 --> 08:24.010
every Wednesday
from three to five?

08:24.045 --> 08:26.621
No, the only dare I got was to
wear a funny ice cream cone hat!

08:28.316 --> 08:30.432
Dare completed!

08:30.468 --> 08:32.961
(laughs) I regret nothing!

08:35.599 --> 08:38.749
Hey. What's with the uniforms?

08:38.785 --> 08:41.093
I thought the softball league
was canceled?

08:41.129 --> 08:42.537
Were you guys playin'
without me?

08:42.572 --> 08:45.115
What? No! No, no, no.
Of course not.

08:45.150 --> 08:50.061
Um... we were just...

08:51.573 --> 08:53.898
rehearsing for a play.

08:53.934 --> 08:56.642
- Yeah.
- About softball.

08:56.678 --> 08:58.695
- Yeah.
- It's a three-hour-long epic musical!

09:00.757 --> 09:03.391
Well, sweet!
I can't wait to see it!

09:03.426 --> 09:06.060
- When is it?
- Uh... some...

09:06.095 --> 09:08.605
Not for, like, a while, I...

09:08.640 --> 09:10.280
This Saturday at 8:00
p.m., in the lounge!

09:12.443 --> 09:14.494
Awesome!

09:14.529 --> 09:15.809
Save me a seat in the front row.

09:19.660 --> 09:24.053
So now we have to put on
a three-hour-long epic musical?

09:24.088 --> 09:27.056
Good luck. I am
a nightmare to work with.

09:32.997 --> 09:35.581
All right, Frankie and I
spent all night writing

09:35.617 --> 09:38.251
a three-hour-long epic musical.

09:38.287 --> 09:39.814
- You spent all night?
- Uh, well, not all night.

09:39.838 --> 09:43.756
The first two hours were Paige
giving me a presentation

09:43.791 --> 09:46.242
as to why Dirk's feelings matter,
which I now know they...

09:49.823 --> 09:50.823
do.

09:50.849 --> 09:54.942
We only have a couple of days
to pull this all together,

09:54.977 --> 09:57.796
so everybody focus,
and no notes.

09:57.831 --> 10:00.423
I have a note.

10:00.458 --> 10:03.718
What if, instead
of Softball: The Musical,

10:03.754 --> 10:06.638
we call it Amelia: The Musical?

10:09.617 --> 10:12.711
Do we really have to do this?

10:12.746 --> 10:16.330
Like, wouldn't it just be
easier to tell Dirk the truth?

10:16.365 --> 10:19.275
You remind me of a small muskrat
pelt I wore as a child.

10:20.970 --> 10:21.970
Yeah!

10:23.648 --> 10:25.673
Guys, we can't
tell Dirk the truth.

10:25.709 --> 10:28.134
- Hey, tell 'em, Frankie.
- Mm.

10:28.169 --> 10:31.228
Because Dirk is our friend,
and if he finds out the truth,

10:31.264 --> 10:32.372
it will hurt his...

10:34.392 --> 10:37.585
feelings.

10:37.620 --> 10:40.655
Great. Okay, so Amelia,
you're playing the glove.

10:40.690 --> 10:45.209
Bernie, you're the ball,
and Viking Guy, you're the bat.

10:45.244 --> 10:50.039
Guys, bad news. I just found out my
cousin's wedding is on Saturday night.

10:50.074 --> 10:51.994
So I'm not gonna be able
to make it to your play.

10:52.786 --> 10:53.918
I'm really bummed.

10:53.954 --> 10:54.954
Good luck, though.

10:55.822 --> 10:57.271
(silence)

10:58.674 --> 10:59.816
Hold on!

11:01.944 --> 11:04.045
What is it, Viking Guy?

11:04.080 --> 11:06.689
What is the hold on?

11:06.724 --> 11:09.316
We can move up opening
to tomorrow!

11:09.352 --> 11:14.488
Tomorrow? That's the only
night this month I'm free!

11:14.524 --> 11:16.925
I literally would've never
seen your play otherwise!

11:16.960 --> 11:19.293
You're welcome, old friend!
(laughs)

11:22.365 --> 11:24.090
Crisis averted!

11:26.561 --> 11:27.969
Hey, guys! I'm Dirk!

11:28.004 --> 11:29.813
And I'm Bernie.

11:29.889 --> 11:31.684
And today we're doing
the Dizzy Mummy Challenge.

11:31.708 --> 11:33.942
We each get a roll
of toilet paper

11:33.944 --> 11:36.636
and have to spin ourselves
until we're wrapped in it!

11:36.671 --> 11:39.705
Then, we try to walk in a straight
line and pop all of these balloons!

11:39.741 --> 11:41.401
Whoever pops all their
balloons first, wins.

11:41.425 --> 11:43.392
Yeah.

11:43.427 --> 11:46.837
Seems like this is the kind of stupid
thing the Internet was invented for.

11:46.873 --> 11:48.948
- Oh my God!
- Oh! Here we go!

11:50.710 --> 11:52.619
Whoo! Whoo!

11:52.654 --> 11:54.003
Whoo!

11:54.039 --> 11:55.039
I'm gonna win!

11:56.941 --> 11:58.507
So many balloons!

11:58.542 --> 11:59.542
(shouts indistinctly)

12:04.933 --> 12:07.074
- Can't see.
- (bell dings)

12:07.109 --> 12:08.468
Okay, goodbye, Vuuuglers.

12:15.268 --> 12:18.819
Come on, guys! Opening night is
tomorrow and we are not ready at all.

12:18.855 --> 12:21.266
- All right, let's take it from the top, people!
- (whistle trills)

12:21.290 --> 12:25.476
That's how you coach a play.

12:25.511 --> 12:28.629
Hey, Paige? Uh, you said I play the
ball, that's like a small part, right?

12:28.664 --> 12:30.904
No, no, it's the lead. You
have the most lines of anyone.

12:31.651 --> 12:32.651
Oh!

12:34.654 --> 12:36.312
Yeah! Yeah! Cool! Cool! Cool!

12:36.347 --> 12:38.614
Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool.

12:38.649 --> 12:43.061
Oh, I'm a terrible actor!

12:43.096 --> 12:45.324
All right, everyone, let's take it
from the scene where the softball...

12:45.348 --> 12:47.731
I have notes on my character.

12:47.767 --> 12:49.950
I don't find him
to be very likable.

12:49.985 --> 12:51.819
Well, you play the villain.

12:51.855 --> 12:55.106
Well, perhaps if he was
some sort of... Viking.

12:55.141 --> 12:57.583
You're a softball bat.

12:57.618 --> 12:59.702
I want to play a viking bat.

12:59.737 --> 13:01.020
That's not a thing!

13:03.274 --> 13:06.217
All right, let's take it from
after the second intermission.

13:06.252 --> 13:10.321
- The glove is about to...
- (playing dark melody)

13:10.357 --> 13:12.507
No, no, no, Horseface Guy.

13:12.542 --> 13:13.949
We talked about this!

13:13.985 --> 13:16.068
I know you're
classically trained,

13:16.104 --> 13:17.845
but this is a light musical
about softballs.

13:17.880 --> 13:19.104
No dark symphonies!

13:19.140 --> 13:20.715
(cracks knuckles)

13:20.750 --> 13:23.835
(plays "Camptown Races")

13:25.388 --> 13:29.707
Split the difference!

13:29.742 --> 13:32.780
Hey, Paige, so, uh, you said I have a lot
of lines, but I'm not singing, right?

13:32.804 --> 13:34.862
Yes, it's all singin',
and in one scene,

13:34.898 --> 13:36.818
you have to hold a single note
for a full minute.

13:37.600 --> 13:39.375
Oh!

13:39.411 --> 13:41.744
Yeah! Yeah! Cool.

13:41.780 --> 13:44.179
Cool, cool, cool,
cool, cool, cool.

13:44.215 --> 13:49.059
Cool. I can't even hold my
bladder for a full minute!

13:49.095 --> 13:51.870
Hey, Frankie! I finished
makin' all the costumes.

13:51.906 --> 13:54.907
Oh, finally, someone is doing
something helpful around here.

13:54.942 --> 13:57.143
Also, I announced the show
on my channel.

13:57.178 --> 14:00.104
What? Why would you do that?

14:00.139 --> 14:03.049
Amelia Duckworth only
performs for a packed house.

14:03.126 --> 14:05.434
You know the saying,
"If a tree falls in the woods,

14:05.470 --> 14:07.102
"and no one's around to hear it,

14:07.138 --> 14:09.697
will anyone subscribe
to my channel?"

14:09.732 --> 14:12.466
- That's not a saying.
- Sure it is.

14:12.501 --> 14:14.338
What's good for the goose
is good for my channel.

14:14.362 --> 14:16.787
Again, not a saying!

14:16.822 --> 14:19.031
Viking Guy: I've heard it!

14:19.067 --> 14:22.218
Okay. Wait. Uh, how many
people bought tickets?

14:22.253 --> 14:24.045
Oh, we're sold out, honey.

14:24.080 --> 14:24.929
- You know what they say...
- (whistle trills)

14:24.964 --> 14:26.147
Just go rehearse!

14:28.609 --> 14:31.177
Hey, Paige, so, uh...

14:31.212 --> 14:33.179
only Dirk's gonna
see this, right?

14:33.214 --> 14:34.774
Nope. Amelia announced
it on her channel.

14:34.798 --> 14:35.990
It's gonna be a packed house.

14:37.410 --> 14:38.451
Oh.

14:40.530 --> 14:42.738
Yeah. Yeah, cool, cool.

14:42.774 --> 14:45.232
Cool, cool, cool, cool,
cool, cool, cool...

14:45.267 --> 14:47.877
Oh, my life is
a black hole of misery!

14:52.025 --> 14:55.084
Hey, guys. Dirk here with Live
Like a Viking Channel Guy.

14:55.120 --> 14:58.512
And today, we're gonna see
whose voice can get the loudest,

14:58.548 --> 15:01.532
using this decibel meter.

15:01.568 --> 15:03.918
In my village, we determine
the winner based on

15:03.953 --> 15:06.162
how many birds fall
from the treetops.

15:06.197 --> 15:10.524
- I dig you, Viking Guy!
- (chuckling) Likewise, Sir Dirk!

15:10.560 --> 15:11.678
- Shall we get loud?
- Get loud!

15:11.702 --> 15:13.077
Here we go!

15:13.112 --> 15:14.779
Kitten makes me weep!

15:16.666 --> 15:19.558
Kittens make me weep!

15:19.593 --> 15:20.926
I've heard that
from my longhouse!

15:20.962 --> 15:21.786
- (bell dings)
- (both laugh)

15:21.821 --> 15:24.739
Is this organic?

15:24.774 --> 15:28.017
Is this organic?

15:28.053 --> 15:29.455
(bell dings) - That was good.
That was good.

15:29.479 --> 15:31.746
Meatball sandwich!

15:31.781 --> 15:34.031
Meatball sandwich!

15:34.066 --> 15:35.015
- Ooh! You won again!
- (bell dings)

15:35.051 --> 15:36.542
Ooh, hoo-hoo!

15:36.577 --> 15:38.386
My throat hurts!

15:40.340 --> 15:43.741
My throat hurts! (Coughs)

15:43.777 --> 15:44.778
(bell dings) - I think
I got you on that one.

15:44.802 --> 15:47.011
I love romantic comedies!

15:47.046 --> 15:50.314
I love romantic comedies!

15:50.349 --> 15:52.828
- No, I love romantic comedies!
- No, I love romantic comedies!

15:52.852 --> 15:55.377
I love romantic comedies!

15:55.412 --> 15:57.366
(bell dings) - We're both winners.
They're good movies.

15:57.390 --> 15:58.390
Yeah. Good movies.

16:03.546 --> 16:06.739
Okay, vocal exercises.

16:06.774 --> 16:11.002
- Toy boat, toy boat...
- Burn and pillage, burn and pillage!

16:13.063 --> 16:15.715
Music performed
by Horseface Guy?

16:15.750 --> 16:17.859
Oh, he's good.

16:17.894 --> 16:21.688
(instruments tuning)

16:21.764 --> 16:25.149
All right. We threw this
thing together in two days,

16:25.185 --> 16:27.665
so let's just go out there, and
hope it's not a total disaster.

16:29.413 --> 16:31.313
(applause) - Paige:
Ladies and gentlemen,

16:31.349 --> 16:33.065
Softball: The Musical.

16:37.430 --> 16:41.791
Aw, shucks! Another day
of being knocked around.

16:41.826 --> 16:44.902
You know, it stinks
being a softball.

16:44.937 --> 16:48.364
I wish I could be... a hardball.

17:47.808 --> 17:49.208
Do you have any advice?

17:49.243 --> 17:50.518

18:50.930 --> 18:53.405
You're not gonna
knock me around anymore, Bat.

18:53.441 --> 18:56.250
Because this softball
has become a hardball.

18:58.145 --> 19:00.254
You don't listen to me,
do you, Ball?

19:02.125 --> 19:05.917
'Cause, I never meant
to hurt you.

19:05.953 --> 19:07.589
I only wanted to hit you
out of the stadium

19:07.613 --> 19:10.097
so that you could finally
live your dreams.

19:13.001 --> 19:17.029
You mean, this whole time you've...
been trying to help me?

19:17.064 --> 19:20.832
Dirk: Oh my gosh!

19:20.868 --> 19:23.485
But, Glove,
I can't take you with me.

19:23.520 --> 19:28.974
It's okay. You don't need a
glove to catch you anymore.

19:29.009 --> 19:31.410
Because you'll be... soaring.

19:34.390 --> 19:38.275
Thank you, everybody!
I'll always be with you.

20:28.285 --> 20:30.269
Guys! That was incredible!

20:30.304 --> 20:31.896
- (both laughing)
- Thanks, Dirk.

20:31.931 --> 20:33.822
- Did you like the costumes?
- So real.

20:33.858 --> 20:36.467
- Did you like the songs?
- Tearjerkers.

20:36.502 --> 20:38.446
Did you like that we only put on
this musical to spare your feelings

20:38.470 --> 20:40.437
because you're
a horrible softball player?

20:43.000 --> 20:44.358
Now where's the wrap party?

20:46.929 --> 20:49.671
Wait.

20:49.707 --> 20:52.633
That's the reason
you guys did this?

20:52.668 --> 20:54.804
I know I'm bad at softball.
Why didn't you just tell me?

20:54.828 --> 20:56.653
I could've handled it.

20:56.689 --> 21:01.275
Oh. Yeah. Cool.
Cool, cool, cool, cool, cool.

21:01.310 --> 21:03.335
What an epic waste of time!

21:06.816 --> 21:09.283
What I meant was...

21:09.318 --> 21:12.769
We're sorry and we should've
told you the truth.

21:12.805 --> 21:16.740
Yeah. From now on, we're always gonna
be 100 percent honest with you.

21:16.776 --> 21:19.176
Guys! Guys, guys, guys, guys!

21:19.212 --> 21:21.203
Great news! There was a
big-time theater producer

21:21.238 --> 21:24.665
in the audience, and he loved the
show so much, he wants to take it

21:24.700 --> 21:25.958
on a national tour!

21:25.993 --> 21:28.059
(laughing)

21:28.095 --> 21:29.811
Hey, but this time,
Dirk should be in it.

21:29.846 --> 21:30.921
Sweet!

21:30.956 --> 21:32.715
I'm a great singer.

21:36.070 --> 21:40.289
