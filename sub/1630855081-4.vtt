WEBVTT

00:02.877 --> 00:04.838
- Previously, on Ride...

00:04.879 --> 00:06.089
- So does my niece.

00:06.131 --> 00:07.924
She's not your only fan
in the family.

00:07.966 --> 00:10.343
- Thank you.
- I saw Valeria meet up

00:10.385 --> 00:11.594
with Tucker Clarke last night.

00:11.636 --> 00:13.346
You don't find it a little
suspicious?

00:13.388 --> 00:15.223
- Okay, I gotta see these moves.

00:15.265 --> 00:16.808
Come on, cowboy, let's go!

00:16.850 --> 00:18.351
- You must be freezing.

00:18.393 --> 00:19.894
- Oh, thank you.

00:19.936 --> 00:22.480
- Valeria has been promoted
to co-foreman.

00:22.522 --> 00:23.898
- I've never even heard
of that before.

00:23.940 --> 00:25.567
- Well, now you have.

00:25.608 --> 00:27.277
- I told you these
McMurray's were cursed.

00:27.318 --> 00:29.362
- Now, the only curse we're
suffering as far as I can tell

00:29.404 --> 00:31.573
is allowing ourselves
to be judged by people like you.

00:32.907 --> 00:34.659
(birds chirping)

00:36.202 --> 00:38.246
(soft country music)

00:43.084 --> 00:45.587
- Get in, loser.
We're doing chores.

00:49.591 --> 00:50.967
- Chores, huh?

00:51.009 --> 00:53.178
(chuckles)

00:55.805 --> 00:58.099
(rock music)

01:00.685 --> 01:03.355
Wonder if Kenny Bucknam's front
lawn needs some tilling too?

01:03.396 --> 01:04.731
(laughing)

01:04.773 --> 01:07.067
- This is supposed to get
your mind off the Gala.

01:07.108 --> 01:08.443
Focus on something else.

01:09.569 --> 01:10.779
You figured out what
you're gonna do

01:10.820 --> 01:12.238
for your mom's birthday yet?

01:14.282 --> 01:16.368
Oh, you forgot?!
- No, I didn't forget!

01:16.409 --> 01:17.660
(laughing)

01:17.702 --> 01:21.081
No. No, my mom,
she hates her birthday, so...

01:21.122 --> 01:24.084
I never know what to do
when it... pops up.

01:24.125 --> 01:26.211
- "Pops up", huh?
- Yeah.

01:26.252 --> 01:29.381
- Okay, move over, I'm driving
while you brainstorm.

01:33.134 --> 01:35.053
- Still here?

01:35.095 --> 01:37.764
- Oh... hey. Morning.

01:37.806 --> 01:38.932
- I brought you something.

01:38.973 --> 01:41.184
- Mmm, read my mind.

01:41.226 --> 01:42.519
Okay, shh...

01:42.560 --> 01:44.020
- You left the light on
all night.

01:44.062 --> 01:47.107
- Oh. Well, Goldie's about
to give birth.

01:47.148 --> 01:49.984
- You always said a watched mare
never foals.

01:50.026 --> 01:52.028
- Yeah, well, she lost
her last one

01:52.070 --> 01:55.115
and I'm not gonna
let that happen again.

01:55.156 --> 01:57.033
- If you're worried,
you should call the vet.

01:57.075 --> 01:58.618
- No, he's out of town.

01:58.660 --> 02:00.995
Look, I got this.

02:01.037 --> 02:02.914
She's waxing,
I checked her milk,

02:02.956 --> 02:04.791
she should be ready to go
in 24 hours.

02:04.833 --> 02:08.294
- And you're just gonna stay up
with her 'til she delivers?

02:08.336 --> 02:11.047
- I was up for three straight
days with you.

02:11.089 --> 02:12.966
And that's when I was
in the hot seat.

02:13.008 --> 02:15.010
No pain meds either.

02:15.051 --> 02:16.386
- Is that why I'm the favourite?

02:16.428 --> 02:17.971
- You're all my favourites.

02:18.013 --> 02:19.681
(chuckling)

02:21.016 --> 02:23.268
Okay, alright, sweetie.

02:23.309 --> 02:25.520
(phone rings)

02:27.689 --> 02:28.898
- Oh.

02:30.108 --> 02:31.359
Oh good, it's you.

02:31.401 --> 02:33.319
- Wish everyone answered
my calls like that.

02:33.361 --> 02:35.280
- Oh, I'm convinced every time
my phone rings

02:35.321 --> 02:37.198
that it's Frontier,
cutting me loose.

02:37.240 --> 02:38.450
- On a Saturday?

02:38.491 --> 02:39.909
- Yeah, you're right,
I probably got like,

02:39.951 --> 02:41.286
39 more hours.

02:41.327 --> 02:43.163
- They're not gonna fire you.

02:43.204 --> 02:45.623
You're all over their social
media in a killer promo.

02:45.665 --> 02:47.667
- Yeah, but not doing
the trick they sent out

02:47.709 --> 02:49.127
a film crew to shoot.

02:49.169 --> 02:50.337
- Your riding is still
impressive.

02:50.378 --> 02:52.589
Which is why I was wondering,

02:52.630 --> 02:54.007
do you do lessons?

02:54.049 --> 02:55.342
- For you?

02:55.383 --> 02:57.010
- No, for my niece, Sophie.

02:57.052 --> 02:58.386
She's been begging.

02:58.428 --> 03:00.388
- Oh, that's sweet.

03:00.430 --> 03:02.349
I mean, I'm okay with it
if you don't mind

03:02.390 --> 03:03.808
getting a couple dirty looks.

03:03.850 --> 03:06.269
- If I get to spend the day
with you on the ranch...

03:06.311 --> 03:07.395
- Hey, family meeting.

03:07.437 --> 03:08.897
- I'm gonna have
to call you back.

03:08.938 --> 03:10.607
(line cutting)
- Hello?

03:11.316 --> 03:12.942
- Well done.
- Oh!

03:12.984 --> 03:14.861
(scoffs)
- And where's Cash?

03:14.903 --> 03:16.154
- I don't know!

03:16.196 --> 03:17.238
(upbeat music)

03:17.280 --> 03:19.157
(cheering)

03:19.199 --> 03:20.533
(Valeria): Yee-haw!

03:20.575 --> 03:21.618
(laughing)

03:21.659 --> 03:23.912
Hang on!
(Cash): Alright, hey, easy!

03:23.953 --> 03:26.373
Hey, easy, whoa!

03:27.123 --> 03:29.376
Woo-hoo!

03:29.834 --> 03:31.127
Oh!

03:31.169 --> 03:33.713
(laughing)

03:33.755 --> 03:36.007
Yeah, as far as things that put
the fear of God in me,

03:36.049 --> 03:37.634
your driving's got Bullet beat.

03:37.676 --> 03:39.177
(laughing)
God!

03:39.219 --> 03:40.679
- Oh shoot, we should...
We should get back,

03:40.720 --> 03:42.597
I don't want the other
ranch hands to see me.

03:43.264 --> 03:44.849
- Since when do you care
what they think?

03:44.891 --> 03:46.726
- Uh, since I became their boss.

03:46.768 --> 03:50.021
- Shouldn't you care less?
- Okay, spoken like a true dude.

03:52.941 --> 03:55.360
What? Cash?

03:55.402 --> 03:57.862
- There are many ways to
be a boss and...

03:57.904 --> 03:59.114
Look, I've seen you in action

03:59.155 --> 04:00.240
and you choose the more,
you know,

04:00.281 --> 04:02.117
business-like, very serious.

04:02.158 --> 04:04.994
I mean, even your voice
dropped down.

04:05.036 --> 04:06.538
(growls)

04:06.579 --> 04:07.622
(laughing)

04:07.664 --> 04:09.791
- What, so I should be
more like Steve?

04:09.833 --> 04:12.168
- No, gosh no.

04:12.210 --> 04:14.421
Uh... be more like you.

04:15.797 --> 04:18.299
- I don't even know
who that is exactly.

04:21.428 --> 04:23.013
- A cool, fun person.

04:24.848 --> 04:27.267
- Even when I'm putting
the fear of God in ya?

04:27.308 --> 04:28.935
- Because you put the fear
of God in me.

04:28.977 --> 04:30.228
(laughing)

04:30.270 --> 04:31.688
(phone notification)

04:31.730 --> 04:33.064
- Alright.

04:35.442 --> 04:37.402
- Tuck says he needs us
at the stables.

04:37.444 --> 04:39.779
- She hasn't slept at all?
- Not a lick.

04:39.821 --> 04:41.448
She's running on coffee
and adrenaline.

04:41.489 --> 04:42.782
- Hey, what's up?
(Valeria laughing)

04:42.824 --> 04:44.242
- Shh...
- Oh.

04:44.284 --> 04:45.577
- Where are you two coming from?

04:45.618 --> 04:47.454
- Uh, ranch tours.
(clears throat)

04:47.495 --> 04:50.290
- Uh, let me guess, this is
about mom's birthday?

04:50.331 --> 04:52.417
- You remembered?
- Remembered, reminded...

04:52.459 --> 04:53.918
- Your mom pulled
an all-nighter.

04:53.960 --> 04:56.504
- And probably will again
if Goldie doesn't deliver.

04:56.546 --> 04:58.965
- Well, maybe tomorrow,
we force her to relax.

04:59.007 --> 05:00.383
It could be the best birthday
present ever.

05:00.425 --> 05:01.718
- I don't know about that.

05:01.760 --> 05:03.386
She's never liked celebrating
her birthday

05:03.428 --> 05:04.971
and last year...

05:05.013 --> 05:06.681
...and last year, she didn't
even get out of bed.

05:06.723 --> 05:08.808
- Yeah, that was...
right after.

05:08.850 --> 05:11.186
- You know, she's always
celebrating everyone else.

05:11.227 --> 05:12.854
Maybe we should celebrate her.

05:12.896 --> 05:15.106
- My mom always had wild
last-minute requests

05:15.148 --> 05:16.483
for her birthday,
so I got pretty good

05:16.524 --> 05:18.151
at throwing things together.
- Perfect!

05:18.193 --> 05:19.986
We'll do like a little shindig.

05:20.028 --> 05:22.489
- Oh yeah, great, so she can
live out her nightmare scenario?

05:22.530 --> 05:24.324
- Okay, we'll keep it small,
low-key.

05:24.366 --> 05:26.242
- Mom's not gonna leave
Goldie's side.

05:26.284 --> 05:27.535
- I could call
Cody the farrier.

05:27.577 --> 05:29.496
Bet you he could get her
out of the stall.

05:29.537 --> 05:30.663
- Great! Okay, well,
I'll get decorations.

05:30.705 --> 05:32.415
- And I'll get a cake.
- Yeah!

05:32.457 --> 05:34.334
- A low-key cake.
- Yeah...

05:34.376 --> 05:35.960
- Wait, what about Poker Sunday?

05:36.002 --> 05:37.337
- What's Poker Sunday?

05:37.379 --> 05:39.339
- Oh, it's this tradition
that they started.

05:39.381 --> 05:41.341
- That we started
when you left.

05:41.383 --> 05:42.634
- We could just do it after.

05:42.676 --> 05:44.177
- Hey!
(clears throat)

05:44.219 --> 05:45.345
What in the world
are y'all doing?

05:45.387 --> 05:47.347
- We, uh...
- Uh...

05:47.389 --> 05:49.599
- Uh, nothing, just checking up
on you and Goldie.

05:49.641 --> 05:50.892
- Well...

05:50.934 --> 05:53.728
You've seen us, now go
back to whatever it is.

05:54.479 --> 05:55.855
Off with you.

05:55.897 --> 05:57.148
- Okay.
- Alright.

05:57.190 --> 05:58.191
- Okay, yeah, sorry.

05:58.233 --> 06:01.444
(soft country music)

06:02.362 --> 06:04.197
Thank you!

06:04.239 --> 06:06.491
- Head up, eyes forward, honey.

06:06.533 --> 06:09.119
Oh! Looks like someone special
is having a birthday.

06:10.870 --> 06:11.788
Lucky lady.

06:13.289 --> 06:14.916
(sighing)
- Hi, Mom.

06:14.958 --> 06:16.876
(chuckling)

06:17.711 --> 06:19.170
(**)

06:23.133 --> 06:25.927
Thanks.
(clears throat)

06:27.262 --> 06:31.516
So, uh...
Is the diner busy as usual?

06:31.558 --> 06:33.768
- Yeah. Yeah,
coffee's just as bad.

06:34.936 --> 06:36.688
So, how has Isabel been?

06:37.313 --> 06:39.399
- She's good.

06:39.441 --> 06:41.568
- I haven't seen her in ages.

06:42.277 --> 06:43.945
Since the funeral, I think.

06:43.987 --> 06:45.739
- Mmm. Yeah, well...

06:45.780 --> 06:49.284
We just wanted to make
things festive.

06:49.325 --> 06:52.078
You know, considering...
Nothing big, just...

06:52.120 --> 06:53.830
a small gathering, just family.

06:56.666 --> 07:00.003
If you... wanna come,
it's tomorrow night.

07:00.045 --> 07:02.714
- Those dirt roads
do a number on my car.

07:03.214 --> 07:04.716
- Right.

07:05.633 --> 07:07.677
- I heard you on that
Desiree radio show.

07:07.719 --> 07:09.054
That was quite something.

07:09.846 --> 07:11.181
- Thanks.

07:11.222 --> 07:12.265
- At least, all that
pageant training

07:12.307 --> 07:13.433
didn't go to waste.

07:13.475 --> 07:15.810
(scoffs)
- Oh, it didn't.

07:16.895 --> 07:19.439
- Honey, why on earth are you
still on that ranch?

07:19.481 --> 07:21.024
- Mom, please--
- No, I'm just asking.

07:21.066 --> 07:23.360
I mean, I don't know anything
about your life,

07:23.401 --> 07:24.652
what you're doing,
if you have any plans...

07:24.694 --> 07:26.446
- Of course, I have plans.

07:26.488 --> 07:28.281
But because they don't
involve techniques

07:28.323 --> 07:29.991
on how to keep
a swimsuit on me on stage,

07:30.033 --> 07:31.576
I figured you didn't
want to hear them.

07:31.618 --> 07:32.994
- I wanna hear them.

07:34.913 --> 07:37.123
- Okay. Um...

07:37.165 --> 07:39.459
I'm coaching Cash.

07:39.501 --> 07:41.294
- Coaching Cash on what?

07:41.336 --> 07:43.004
- Bull riding.
(sighing)

07:43.046 --> 07:44.339
It's basically what
I did for Austin.

07:44.381 --> 07:45.632
- Yeah, and look
where that got you.

07:45.674 --> 07:46.966
- What is that supposed to mean?

07:47.008 --> 07:48.927
- I just don't want you
to repeat my mistakes.

07:48.968 --> 07:50.595
Throw away your life
on another cowboy

07:50.637 --> 07:52.389
that's just gonna
break your heart.

07:52.430 --> 07:54.683
- Austin didn't
break my heart, Mom.

07:54.724 --> 07:56.601
He died.

07:56.643 --> 07:58.978
And he was nothing like Dad.

07:59.020 --> 08:01.523
- Yeah, well they're both
still gone, aren't they?

08:02.649 --> 08:04.693
(soft music)

08:06.778 --> 08:09.656
- And you wonder why I never
come around anymore.

08:10.615 --> 08:12.659
- Missy, I just want
what's best for you

08:12.701 --> 08:14.411
and I wish you could see that.

08:14.452 --> 08:17.038
- Yeah. Me too.

08:19.708 --> 08:21.918
Thanks for the coffee.

08:24.295 --> 08:26.589
(sighing)

08:32.637 --> 08:34.806
- You're preparing for poker
or the apocalypse?

08:34.848 --> 08:37.642
- Monthly poker games
are sacred around here.

08:37.684 --> 08:40.186
Keep making jokes
and you might lose your invite.

08:40.228 --> 08:41.855
(scoffing)

08:41.896 --> 08:45.275
- So, am I finally gonna meet
the famous Valeria?

08:45.316 --> 08:47.861
- No, she's not invited.

08:47.902 --> 08:51.031
I went to go to apologize to her
after what she said...

08:51.072 --> 08:53.825
I found four fake IDs
in her stuff.

08:53.867 --> 08:55.452
- Are you gonna talk
to her about it?

08:55.493 --> 08:58.747
- Why? She won't tell us where
she disappeared to for a year,

08:58.788 --> 09:01.791
she lied about Tucker Clarke,
she'll just lie about this too.

09:01.833 --> 09:04.210
- So?
- So our family deserves to know

09:04.252 --> 09:05.420
what she's been up to.

09:05.462 --> 09:07.672
- Just give her time.

09:07.714 --> 09:09.966
It can be complicated
going home.

09:10.717 --> 09:13.261
- Is it complicated for you?

09:13.303 --> 09:16.306
- I came here to be around
the best of the best.

09:16.348 --> 09:18.058
To train as hard as I can.

09:18.099 --> 09:19.601
- You sound like Cash.

09:19.642 --> 09:21.311
- Well, broncs are different
from bulls,

09:21.353 --> 09:23.104
but when you come
from a small town,

09:23.146 --> 09:24.731
there's always pressure.

09:24.773 --> 09:28.234
But at least, you have
each other, family to lean on.

09:28.276 --> 09:29.944
And Valeria's part of that.

09:29.986 --> 09:32.530
So, just think before you go...

09:32.572 --> 09:34.616
blowing it up.

09:34.657 --> 09:38.244
'Cause I wish I had
half as much as you do.

09:38.286 --> 09:42.374
- Well... at least for now,

09:42.415 --> 09:44.250
you have me.

09:44.292 --> 09:46.628
(phone notification)

09:48.463 --> 09:51.299
The farrier's here.
You wanna...

09:51.341 --> 09:53.176
- I'll put this stuff away.

09:53.218 --> 09:54.969
- I should... yeah.

09:56.471 --> 09:58.348
(soft music)

09:59.766 --> 10:01.976
Yeah, you'll be fine...
But, Cody...

10:02.018 --> 10:03.311
(clears throat)

10:05.480 --> 10:08.274
- Cody?
- Howdy, ma'am.

10:08.316 --> 10:11.194
- I don't remember having any
shoeings booked for today.

10:11.236 --> 10:13.196
- Uh, I called him.

10:13.238 --> 10:15.448
Samson's gait seems off.

10:15.490 --> 10:17.158
- Yeah, I took a peek.

10:17.200 --> 10:18.618
I think he's uh...

10:18.660 --> 10:20.328
he's swivelling through
the hocks.

10:20.370 --> 10:22.122
- I hadn't noticed anything.

10:22.163 --> 10:24.708
Um... didn't you just
shoe him last week?

10:24.749 --> 10:27.168
- It couldn't hurt
to double-check? Right?

10:28.211 --> 10:29.379
- Uh, yeah, Isabel,

10:29.421 --> 10:30.672
I can't in good conscience

10:30.714 --> 10:32.924
leave without you
taking a look first.

10:33.633 --> 10:36.219
(sighing)
- Okay.

10:36.261 --> 10:37.804
- I got it.

10:43.184 --> 10:45.478
- So, you were a football player
before you were a bullfighter?

10:45.520 --> 10:48.440
- Mm-hmm.
All state, three years running.

10:48.481 --> 10:49.899
Could have gone pro.

10:49.941 --> 10:53.361
- That was lucky for me.
He saved my life 31 times.

10:53.403 --> 10:55.363
- No, no, 32.
- 32!

10:55.405 --> 10:57.490
- Wait, wait, wait, hold on.

10:57.532 --> 10:58.825
You were in the marines too?

10:58.867 --> 11:00.368
- That's where we met.

11:00.410 --> 11:02.829
Couple of ranchers
from Colorado

11:02.871 --> 11:04.539
sharing a foxhole
halfway across the world.

11:04.581 --> 11:05.999
- I found out he was a McMurray,

11:06.041 --> 11:08.668
I knew exactly what I wanted
my next gig to be.

11:08.710 --> 11:11.338
I've dodged linebackers,
bullets...

11:11.379 --> 11:12.839
- Fists!

11:12.881 --> 11:14.632
- Let's just say bulls
don't scare me that much.

11:14.674 --> 11:15.842
(grunting)

11:15.884 --> 11:17.218
- How many lives you've lived,
Nic?

11:17.260 --> 11:18.970
- I can't tell you that.

11:19.012 --> 11:20.680
Let's just say, the CIA
would have my neck.

11:20.722 --> 11:22.557
(sighing)

11:22.599 --> 11:24.225
- CIA?

11:25.643 --> 11:27.937
(laughing)

11:27.979 --> 11:29.814
- Dang, he's gone gullible!

11:29.856 --> 11:31.691
- Guys, there's like a lot
of work to be done here.

11:31.733 --> 11:33.109
You wanna help out?

11:33.151 --> 11:35.028
- Yeah, Cash, what are you
working on there?

11:35.070 --> 11:38.823
(sighing)
- Now, this is a gift for Mom.

11:38.865 --> 11:41.993
A little, you know,
outdoor rest and relaxation.

11:42.035 --> 11:43.536
- We still playing
poker tomorrow?

11:43.578 --> 11:45.205
- Oh, uh... of course.

11:45.246 --> 11:47.165
I got my eyes on these
new pairs of chaps

11:47.207 --> 11:49.084
and based off the way
you fellas play,

11:49.125 --> 11:50.377
I'm gonna have them.
(chuckling)

11:50.418 --> 11:52.420
- You got a pretty face,
not a poker face, bud.

11:52.462 --> 11:53.755
(chuckling)
- Thank you.

11:53.797 --> 11:55.674
- So, do you need
a formal invite

11:55.715 --> 11:56.883
to this poker game?

11:56.925 --> 12:00.345
- Uh... sure, sure, yeah.

12:00.387 --> 12:01.680
- Hmm...
(clears throat)

12:01.721 --> 12:03.473
- Do you know how to play?

12:03.515 --> 12:05.225
(laughing)

12:05.809 --> 12:07.811
(country music)

12:07.852 --> 12:10.271
- Come on, buddy.
There you go.

12:11.272 --> 12:12.691
Yeah.

12:12.732 --> 12:14.776
- His footfall looks fine.

12:14.818 --> 12:17.404
- Yeah, so it is. Yeah.

12:17.445 --> 12:19.656
- You know, uh... Cody,

12:19.698 --> 12:21.324
I've been working
with you for decades

12:21.366 --> 12:23.743
and you've never once
misdiagnosed anything.

12:23.785 --> 12:25.120
- It's a pretty great
track record.

12:25.161 --> 12:27.080
Write me a Yelp review
with that?

12:27.122 --> 12:29.249
- Mm-hmm.
- Anyway, the fact that I'm here

12:29.290 --> 12:31.209
anyway... put me to work.

12:31.251 --> 12:33.086
Maybe I can check in
on Goldie or something.

12:33.128 --> 12:35.588
- Did a certain son of mine
put you up to this?

12:35.630 --> 12:37.507
- What? Well...
(scoffing)

12:37.549 --> 12:39.384
- Cody. Come on.

12:39.426 --> 12:40.760
(horse neighing)

12:40.802 --> 12:43.596
- Listen, if Tuff asks,
I didn't say nothing.

12:43.638 --> 12:45.765
- If I needed help,
I would ask for it.

12:45.807 --> 12:47.600
- No, you wouldn't.
(scoffs)

12:47.642 --> 12:49.519
Listen, I know you've been
up all night,

12:49.561 --> 12:51.062
so how about I get you
some coffee?

12:51.104 --> 12:52.355
I've been hungry
for scones anyway--

12:52.397 --> 12:54.482
- You know what,
if you bring me back a scone,

12:54.524 --> 12:55.984
I swear on my life,

12:56.026 --> 12:58.778
you'll never shoe another horse
on this ranch.

12:58.820 --> 13:00.989
- Fine, then.
Blueberry muffins it is!

13:01.031 --> 13:02.198
- No, I--
- Alright, yeah,

13:02.240 --> 13:03.992
I'll figure out
something for next time!

13:04.034 --> 13:05.827
- Yah!
(indistinct chatter)

13:05.869 --> 13:07.912
(horses neighing)

13:07.954 --> 13:10.457
Yeah, get in there, come on!

13:10.498 --> 13:12.292
Get in there, come on!

13:12.334 --> 13:14.002
- First time.
You'll get the hang of it.

13:14.044 --> 13:16.004
- Oh, at least one of us
is riding well.

13:16.838 --> 13:18.757
The arena's out my window.
(clears throat)

13:18.798 --> 13:20.967
- Yeah, okay.

13:21.009 --> 13:22.844
Still not in time
for Frontier, though.

13:22.886 --> 13:25.430
- Well, at least you didn't make
a public spectacle

13:25.472 --> 13:26.639
of yourself at a gala.

13:26.681 --> 13:27.891
- Yeah, that was pretty epic.

13:27.932 --> 13:29.768
- Yeah, that way back
when I used to think

13:29.809 --> 13:31.561
I could rely on my
killer riding moves.

13:31.603 --> 13:33.188
(bull bellowing)

13:33.229 --> 13:35.398
- The bulls are kind of
knocking my confidence.

13:35.440 --> 13:36.775
- Stop, you're fine.

13:36.816 --> 13:38.109
Seriously.

13:39.194 --> 13:40.737
(bull bellowing)

13:40.779 --> 13:42.906
- Hey, where did you go,
end of the night?

13:43.823 --> 13:46.242
- Uh... I went for a walk.

13:46.284 --> 13:47.660
You?

13:47.702 --> 13:49.245
- Yeah, same.

13:51.706 --> 13:52.999
- Okay. Yeah.
- Yeah.

13:53.041 --> 13:55.126
- I should, uh... get going.
- Yeah, yeah.

13:55.168 --> 13:57.379
Uh, hey, don't stress, today.

13:57.420 --> 13:59.214
You'll settle.
- Yeah.

14:01.383 --> 14:03.510
- I mean, if I were them
and you showed up

14:03.551 --> 14:05.845
with a six pack and some money
burning a hole in your pocket,

14:05.887 --> 14:07.263
I would be impressed.

14:07.305 --> 14:09.891
And if they're not,
that's their problem.

14:10.433 --> 14:12.268
- Hmm.

14:12.310 --> 14:13.645
Now, that is cake.

14:13.687 --> 14:17.357
- I know, I wanted it to feel
like a celebration.

14:18.191 --> 14:20.402
Though, I did invite my mother.

14:20.443 --> 14:21.861
- Oh.

14:21.903 --> 14:23.279
(laughing)
- I ran into her

14:23.321 --> 14:25.031
outside of Eloise's,
and it was so awkward,

14:25.073 --> 14:27.575
I just blurted out
the invitation.

14:28.326 --> 14:31.079
Though, I highly doubt
she's gonna show up.

14:31.121 --> 14:33.123
(scoffing)
- I don't know.

14:33.164 --> 14:35.083
Connie is full of surprises.

14:35.125 --> 14:37.877
- We had coffee afterwards
and it did not go well.

14:37.919 --> 14:42.007
She says I'm wasting my life
on another McMurray boy.

14:42.799 --> 14:44.884
- Wait, she thinks
you're with Cash?

14:44.926 --> 14:47.012
- What? No. She just...

14:47.053 --> 14:48.805
She thinks that
I'll never move on.

14:48.847 --> 14:51.182
Argh, she just...
she gets under my skin.

14:51.224 --> 14:54.436
She's never cared what I wanted.

14:55.311 --> 14:57.731
- Hmm.
- Oh.

14:57.772 --> 14:59.065
Sorry, I shouldn't have...

14:59.107 --> 15:01.359
- No, look, just 'cause
I didn't have a mom,

15:01.401 --> 15:03.945
doesn't mean you can't
vent about yours.

15:04.946 --> 15:07.991
I hate to say this,
but she might have a point.

15:08.033 --> 15:10.744
You're so busy taking care
of these McMurrays.

15:10.785 --> 15:12.454
You're allowed
to focus on you too.

15:13.288 --> 15:15.081
- Right.

15:15.123 --> 15:18.209
- I'm gonna stash these
in the barn.

15:18.251 --> 15:20.462
- Okay, here,
put these in there.

15:22.422 --> 15:25.050
- I'mma take this with me.
(laughing)

15:26.551 --> 15:28.636
(soft music)

15:33.683 --> 15:35.143
(Gus): Hello?
- Hey.

15:35.185 --> 15:37.395
- Oh, hey.
- Um, how's tomorrow?

15:37.437 --> 15:38.730
For you and Sophie.

15:43.109 --> 15:45.445
(owl hooting in distance)

15:50.950 --> 15:54.704
- Three, two, one...

15:54.746 --> 15:56.039
- Oh!
(laughs)

15:56.081 --> 15:57.624
Oh, is it midnight already?

15:57.665 --> 15:59.000
- Happy birthday, Mama.

15:59.042 --> 16:01.670
- Oh... Tuff.
(sighing)

16:01.711 --> 16:03.588
What did you do?

16:05.882 --> 16:08.134
Sleepytime Tea?
Very funny.

16:08.176 --> 16:09.219
- There's also three pounds

16:09.260 --> 16:10.887
of Whole Bean Coffee
waiting for you,

16:10.929 --> 16:12.222
but you're not getting any of it

16:12.263 --> 16:13.682
'til you get a full
night's sleep.

16:13.723 --> 16:15.183
- No.

16:15.225 --> 16:17.811
I haven't had a full
night's sleep in over a year

16:17.852 --> 16:19.437
so this isn't gonna do squat.

16:19.479 --> 16:21.272
(sighing)

16:21.314 --> 16:24.734
I suppose Cody was also
a gift of yours?

16:26.152 --> 16:28.363
I don't want gifts,
you know that.

16:28.405 --> 16:30.198
- You do so much for all of us.

16:30.240 --> 16:31.783
- Well, that's a mama's job.

16:31.825 --> 16:33.660
- And at some point,
it's our job

16:33.702 --> 16:34.953
to take care of you too.

16:34.994 --> 16:36.246
- Are you saying I'm old?

16:36.287 --> 16:38.915
- No, I'm not saying you're old.

16:38.957 --> 16:40.500
It's not about age.

16:41.334 --> 16:43.128
We just...

16:43.169 --> 16:45.213
want you to know how much
we appreciate you.

16:45.255 --> 16:48.842
- Well, thank you,
but I don't need gifts for that.

16:48.883 --> 16:51.761
- Maybe not.
- I just need my Goldie

16:51.803 --> 16:53.388
over here to have
a healthy child.

16:54.514 --> 16:56.641
Foal.
(laughing)

16:56.683 --> 16:58.059
Wow.

16:59.602 --> 17:00.979
You know what I mean.

17:01.021 --> 17:02.689
(sighs)

17:02.731 --> 17:04.691
(soft country music)

17:04.733 --> 17:06.276
(bellowing)

17:07.402 --> 17:10.030
(metal squeaking)

17:12.615 --> 17:14.701
- Alright, that was better.

17:15.702 --> 17:18.413
You still got time for a run
and some circuits before lunch.

17:20.040 --> 17:22.042
- Hey, guys, take five.

17:23.960 --> 17:25.337
I uh...

17:25.378 --> 17:26.796
I thought we were gonna
do that together.

17:26.838 --> 17:28.131
- Yeah, I just...

17:28.173 --> 17:29.966
I got something to do today.

17:30.008 --> 17:32.010
But hey, don't let
yesterday's ride spook you.

17:32.052 --> 17:33.887
You're in good shape.

17:33.928 --> 17:35.847
- Missy!

17:35.889 --> 17:37.724
- Hi!

17:37.766 --> 17:39.017
- Sorry to interrupt.

17:39.059 --> 17:40.894
Someone insisted
we get here early.

17:40.935 --> 17:42.437
- Welcome to the McMurray ranch.

17:42.479 --> 17:43.855
Are you ready
for some trail riding?

17:43.897 --> 17:45.190
- Mm-hmm!
- Okay, let's go look

17:45.231 --> 17:46.608
at the horses this way.

17:46.649 --> 17:48.026
(chuckling)

17:48.068 --> 17:49.944
- It's a trail ride, huh?

17:49.986 --> 17:51.988
Are you still
scoping our land, Gus?

17:52.655 --> 17:54.866
- Don't worry, today is not
about business.

17:54.908 --> 17:56.409
It's just pleasure.

17:57.619 --> 17:59.746
- Gus is here?
- Yeah.

17:59.788 --> 18:02.248
- You can't tell me that's
Missy's birthday gift to Mom.

18:02.290 --> 18:05.460
- She wants to give him
and his niece riding lessons.

18:06.252 --> 18:08.588
- Listen, speaking
of "fake covers"...

18:08.630 --> 18:10.382
- Oh, so you do think
it's a cover?

18:10.423 --> 18:13.051
- I mean, you're not buying
the riding lesson thing either.

18:13.093 --> 18:14.552
- I'm not. No.

18:14.594 --> 18:16.346
You figure out what
we're gonna tell Mom

18:16.388 --> 18:18.223
about why she doesn't have
to cook dinner tonight?

18:18.264 --> 18:20.642
- Not yet. But I am glad
we're doing something.

18:20.684 --> 18:23.728
Last night, she called
Goldie's fowl a "child".

18:23.770 --> 18:25.313
- Ah...

18:25.355 --> 18:27.982
- This horse's name is Sunny.

18:28.024 --> 18:30.068
Here, you put your palm
out flat.

18:30.110 --> 18:31.778
Yeah, just like that.

18:33.571 --> 18:35.198
There we go.

18:35.240 --> 18:37.325
Now you guys are best friends!

18:39.119 --> 18:41.705
- Can we buy a ranch like this,
uncle Gus?

18:41.746 --> 18:43.373
- Believe me, I'm trying, kiddo.

18:43.415 --> 18:46.084
I'm kidding.
(laughing)

18:46.126 --> 18:47.752
- You are going to love it here.

18:47.794 --> 18:49.129
We have a whole bunch of cows.

18:49.170 --> 18:51.089
We have a whole field of sheep.

18:51.131 --> 18:53.383
- Wow.
- And, best part,

18:53.425 --> 18:55.427
we have a treehouse
by the river.

18:55.468 --> 18:57.804
I used to play there so much,
I used to call it home.

18:57.846 --> 18:59.305
- Did you ever sleep in it?

18:59.347 --> 19:00.765
- All the time.
It was terribly uncomfortable.

19:00.807 --> 19:02.100
(laughing)

19:02.142 --> 19:03.977
That's how much
I love this ranch.

19:04.019 --> 19:05.562
You and uncle Gus
are ready to ride?

19:05.603 --> 19:06.813
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

19:06.855 --> 19:09.691
- Yeah! Here, let's get
that helmet on you.

19:09.733 --> 19:11.401
(soft music)

19:12.527 --> 19:14.446
First, we're gonna
follow the river.

19:14.487 --> 19:16.948
It's a big straight line,
and then to the left

19:16.990 --> 19:18.658
is that treehouse
I told you about.

19:19.743 --> 19:22.579
- Uncle Gus, it's so pretty!

19:22.620 --> 19:24.289
- It sure is, kiddo.

19:26.666 --> 19:28.418
(**)

19:33.798 --> 19:35.884
- So at that point, we'd been
separated from our unit

19:35.925 --> 19:37.469
for three whole days.

19:37.510 --> 19:39.054
- That's right.
We were so thirsty,

19:39.095 --> 19:40.388
we would have done anything
for some water.

19:40.430 --> 19:41.639
- Yeah, well speak for yourself,

19:41.681 --> 19:42.766
I could've used a beer.

19:42.807 --> 19:43.933
- How's this?

19:45.560 --> 19:47.729
Mind if I join?

19:47.771 --> 19:49.522
- No, no, of course not.

19:50.065 --> 19:53.818
- Thanks. Hi, I'm Val.

19:53.860 --> 19:54.819
- Hey, I'm Julian.

19:55.904 --> 19:58.073
- Oh, you're that hunky
bronc rider

19:58.114 --> 19:59.532
I've heard so much about.

19:59.574 --> 20:01.326
- I've heard a lot
about you as well.

20:02.077 --> 20:03.661
- Hmm.

20:04.204 --> 20:05.789
- So, how do we do this?

20:06.664 --> 20:08.249
- You don't know
how to play poker?

20:08.291 --> 20:11.169
- No, but I did watch
some games online.

20:11.211 --> 20:12.837
It looks like a lot of fun.

20:12.879 --> 20:15.548
(scoffing)
- Sure is.

20:16.049 --> 20:17.676
So what are we playing, boys?

20:17.717 --> 20:18.927
- Five card draw.

20:18.968 --> 20:20.220
- Cool, who's dealing?

20:20.261 --> 20:21.554
- It's all you.

20:23.848 --> 20:25.308
- Hmm.

20:26.559 --> 20:28.061
(sighing)

20:28.103 --> 20:29.437
Alright.

20:29.479 --> 20:32.607
How about a no limit bet,
winner takes all.

20:32.649 --> 20:34.651
You can check, but only if
there are no bets on the table.

20:34.693 --> 20:36.820
And if you call,
you gotta match the bet.

20:37.612 --> 20:40.907
And just for fun, deuces wild.

20:40.949 --> 20:42.033
- Dang, girl!

20:42.075 --> 20:44.327
(chuckling)

20:45.578 --> 20:47.247
(horse neighing)

20:48.623 --> 20:50.875
- Can I give Sunny
something to eat?

20:50.917 --> 20:53.962
- For sure. Why don't you give
one to Whisky and Pepper too

20:54.004 --> 20:55.588
so they don't get jealous?

20:55.630 --> 20:56.923
(chuckles)

20:59.217 --> 21:01.219
- She's in heaven right now.

21:01.261 --> 21:03.638
- Yeah, I remember
being that age.

21:03.680 --> 21:06.099
Horses were magical back then.

21:06.141 --> 21:08.268
I guess I still
kinda think they are.

21:08.309 --> 21:10.228
- That must be nice.

21:10.270 --> 21:12.605
Finding out what you're
passionate about so young.

21:12.647 --> 21:14.941
- Yeah, it wasn't
without its bumps.

21:14.983 --> 21:17.694
My mom, she hated horses.

21:17.736 --> 21:20.864
She wanted me
to dazzle on a stage.

21:20.905 --> 21:22.866
- Oh, so you're a rebel, then.

21:22.907 --> 21:24.951
I should take a page
out of your playbook.

21:24.993 --> 21:27.245
- Ah!
- My parents hate the idea

21:27.287 --> 21:28.997
of me buying a ranch.

21:29.039 --> 21:30.582
They want me in a corner office,

21:30.623 --> 21:33.418
but... sometimes,
knowing what you don't want

21:33.460 --> 21:35.086
helps you figure out
what you do.

21:35.128 --> 21:38.256
That's what I'm hoping.
- Mm-hmm.

21:38.298 --> 21:40.508
- So, what was it about
trick riding

21:40.550 --> 21:42.344
that made you fall
in love with it?

21:42.385 --> 21:44.554
- Oh, it's just something
about...

21:44.596 --> 21:47.015
...that rush of adrenaline
you get

21:47.057 --> 21:48.933
from dragging off
a galloping horse.

21:48.975 --> 21:51.644
- So, you're a rebel
and an adrenaline junkie.

21:51.686 --> 21:53.229
- Yeah, that makes me sound
a little more excited

21:53.271 --> 21:54.439
than I actually am.

21:54.481 --> 21:57.650
- Um, I can see why
Sophie's enamored.

21:58.026 --> 22:00.403
(soft music)

22:01.071 --> 22:02.781
Where is Sophie?

22:02.822 --> 22:05.200
- I don't know. Sophie?

22:05.241 --> 22:06.785
- Sophie?

22:09.329 --> 22:11.373
- Cash, I've never seen
you fold so fast.

22:11.414 --> 22:13.208
What are you pinching
your pennies for?

22:13.249 --> 22:14.542
- Maybe he's got himself
a little lady friend?

22:14.584 --> 22:16.044
- I did hear sparks were flying

22:16.086 --> 22:17.837
when he danced
with Barbara Sutton.

22:17.879 --> 22:19.297
(laughing)

22:19.339 --> 22:20.590
- I'm just trying to be focused.

22:20.632 --> 22:21.716
I got my eyes
on this sponsorship.

22:21.758 --> 22:23.301
- Are you sure
you're a bull rider?

22:23.343 --> 22:25.136
(laughing)
- Or maybe I like to keep

22:25.178 --> 22:26.471
my options open.

22:26.513 --> 22:28.515
Huh? I got a great poker face.

22:32.852 --> 22:35.480
- Call or bet?
What's it gonna be?

22:35.522 --> 22:37.732
- Just give me a second.

22:37.774 --> 22:39.484
(laughing)

22:39.526 --> 22:41.152
- Guess now would be
a bad time to mention

22:41.194 --> 22:42.529
I never lose at poker.

22:42.570 --> 22:44.280
- Yeah, I don't know
if I believe that.

22:44.322 --> 22:46.199
- Neither did the guy
I played in Utah.

22:46.241 --> 22:47.575
- Why were you in Utah?

22:47.617 --> 22:49.327
- When I ran out of gas,

22:49.369 --> 22:51.454
the only way I could get home
was to win some cash

22:51.496 --> 22:53.164
in a game of five card draw.

22:53.206 --> 22:54.499
I played this cowboy,

22:54.541 --> 22:56.084
cleaned him out
but he refused to pay up.

22:56.126 --> 22:58.169
Insisted I was cheating.

22:58.211 --> 22:59.713
- So what did you do?

22:59.754 --> 23:03.216
- Well, man was 6'6 and 290.
Nothing I could do.

23:03.258 --> 23:04.843
'Til I got to the parking lot

23:04.884 --> 23:06.636
where he had parked
his brand new dually

23:06.678 --> 23:08.555
that he conveniently
just filled up.

23:08.596 --> 23:10.015
- You siphoned it?
- Gas fumes are horrible

23:10.056 --> 23:11.224
for your lungs.

23:11.266 --> 23:13.351
- Oh please, I'm a lady.

23:13.393 --> 23:14.894
I siphoned it using two hoses.

23:14.936 --> 23:16.855
A quick puff into one,
pressurized the tank

23:16.896 --> 23:18.940
and the gas flows
right on out the other.

23:18.982 --> 23:20.191
- I've never heard of that.

23:20.233 --> 23:21.776
- You've never heard
of a lot of things.

23:21.818 --> 23:23.570
(laughing)
- It's just science, dude.

23:23.611 --> 23:25.405
Anyway, it didn't cover
what he owed me,

23:25.447 --> 23:27.907
but it did get me to Salt Lake
for my next barrel race.

23:30.410 --> 23:32.203
- Funny how you can know someone
your whole life

23:32.245 --> 23:33.663
and they still surprise you.

23:36.458 --> 23:38.084
I'm all in.

23:38.126 --> 23:39.085
- Oh, oh, oh!
(whistles)

23:39.127 --> 23:40.754
- Big spender!
- Alright.

23:41.921 --> 23:43.882
(Tuff clears throat)

23:43.923 --> 23:46.051
- Call.
- Whoa!

23:46.092 --> 23:47.761
Four of a kind.

23:48.636 --> 23:50.263
- Look at that.
- Flush!

23:50.305 --> 23:51.848
Womp, womp...

23:51.890 --> 23:54.059
(chuckles)
- Aww...

23:54.100 --> 23:56.019
Don't look so glum, Tuff.

23:56.061 --> 23:58.688
I'll take my winnings

23:58.730 --> 24:00.899
and everyone out here
for a beer.

24:00.940 --> 24:02.859
(cheering)

24:02.901 --> 24:04.569
- Love you, Val!

24:06.529 --> 24:08.114
- Sophie!
- Sophie!

24:09.657 --> 24:11.451
- This isn't funny!

24:12.535 --> 24:14.329
Come out if you're hiding!

24:14.371 --> 24:15.830
Sophie!

24:18.124 --> 24:19.584
- She's not here.

24:25.215 --> 24:26.591
- I should have kept
a closer eye.

24:26.633 --> 24:28.551
- No, I distracted you.
- We got lost on this ranch

24:28.593 --> 24:30.345
all the time as kids
and we always got home safe.

24:30.387 --> 24:32.514
- Yeah, and Nic and the other
ranchers are already looking.

24:32.555 --> 24:33.765
- Okay, look, we'll find her.

24:33.807 --> 24:35.266
The important thing
is that we don't panic.

24:35.308 --> 24:36.476
- Okay, stick to your buddy

24:36.518 --> 24:37.977
and go in your assigned
directions.

24:38.019 --> 24:39.521
- Okay, I'll go back
to the stables,

24:39.562 --> 24:41.022
just in case she turns up there
and everyone,

24:41.064 --> 24:42.774
just remember to keep
your phones on.

24:42.816 --> 24:44.609
- And we were worried
about Mom's birthday

24:44.651 --> 24:46.861
being triggering without her
having to search for a lost kid.

24:46.903 --> 24:48.780
- Maybe we should
cancel the shindig?

24:48.822 --> 24:49.864
- What, shindig?

24:50.990 --> 24:52.617
(sighing)

24:53.368 --> 24:54.869
(sighing)

25:03.545 --> 25:05.672
- Hey, I come in peace.
- Hi...

25:05.714 --> 25:07.966
- Check my pockets, not a single
baked good on me.

25:08.008 --> 25:09.509
- Uh...

25:09.551 --> 25:11.011
- What's wrong?

25:11.052 --> 25:13.013
- There's a little girl
lost on the ranch.

25:13.054 --> 25:14.764
And...

25:14.806 --> 25:17.934
Ugh, I said I'd stay here
in case she came this way.

25:17.976 --> 25:20.061
- Well, I got Trigger
in the trailer and I can cover

25:20.103 --> 25:21.771
a lot of ground.
- No, no, no, there's already

25:21.813 --> 25:23.982
a bunch of people out there
looking for her. It's...

25:24.024 --> 25:25.692
(sighs)

25:25.734 --> 25:29.446
- Alright, I'll sit back here
with you.

25:29.487 --> 25:31.614
After all, you've got
a pregnant mare in there.

25:31.656 --> 25:33.241
Not that you can't handle it.

25:34.492 --> 25:36.327
- Alright, well...

25:36.369 --> 25:38.038
As long as you distract me.

25:39.205 --> 25:40.790
(sighing)

25:43.335 --> 25:45.045
There's a million places
she could be.

25:45.086 --> 25:47.589
And the river is sky high
this time of year.

25:47.630 --> 25:49.215
- You know, there's still
a lot of time,

25:49.257 --> 25:50.550
there's plenty of light left.

25:50.592 --> 25:52.302
Don't worry,
they're gonna find her.

25:52.344 --> 25:54.137
(sighing)

25:56.139 --> 25:58.183
- You know, ranch life is...

25:58.224 --> 26:00.060
not for the faint of heart.

26:02.187 --> 26:06.232
It's just... it gets to me
sometimes more than others.

26:06.274 --> 26:07.901
- It's understandable.

26:09.903 --> 26:11.404
- And my kids!

26:11.446 --> 26:15.033
My kids... think that
I'm overworked,

26:16.159 --> 26:20.705
half-crazed, so they planned
this shindig...

26:20.747 --> 26:22.457
(indistinct chatter)

26:22.499 --> 26:24.876
Shindig, I don't know...
- Isabel, wait...

26:24.918 --> 26:26.670
Is it your birthday? It is!
- Oh! Oh, no.

26:26.711 --> 26:28.171
Come on, not you too!

26:28.213 --> 26:29.631
- What's wrong with
acknowledging your birthday?

26:29.673 --> 26:31.049
- A lot!
- Really?

26:31.091 --> 26:32.217
- Yes.

26:32.258 --> 26:34.177
- You know, all I know...

26:34.219 --> 26:35.720
...is that...

26:35.762 --> 26:37.806
you know, the bad times,

26:37.847 --> 26:39.808
they make the good times better.

26:41.351 --> 26:43.436
This is really just
about your kids.

26:43.478 --> 26:45.230
They wanna celebrate you.

26:45.271 --> 26:46.815
(scoffing)

26:49.442 --> 26:50.985
- Sophie!
- Sophie!

26:52.153 --> 26:54.864
- I know you think
I shouldn't say anything,

26:54.906 --> 26:56.991
that I should maintain
the peace...

26:58.034 --> 27:00.328
I'm not feeling very
peaceful right now.

27:00.370 --> 27:03.540
The more I get to know Valeria,
the more I realize...

27:03.581 --> 27:05.583
I don't know anything about her.

27:05.625 --> 27:08.086
Poker, swindling that guy...

27:08.128 --> 27:10.422
And now she's all buddy-buddy
with Cash.

27:10.463 --> 27:13.508
- You really are
the family bullfighter.

27:13.550 --> 27:16.094
Have to protect everyone.

27:16.136 --> 27:17.929
But no one asked you.

27:18.805 --> 27:20.765
Except to help look
for this little girl.

27:22.017 --> 27:23.393
- Sophie!

27:23.435 --> 27:24.853
- Sophie!

27:26.187 --> 27:27.480
- She's not in here.

27:27.522 --> 27:28.440
(sighing)

27:28.481 --> 27:29.941
She's gonna be fine.

27:29.983 --> 27:32.110
One time, Austin and me
were out here for days

27:32.152 --> 27:33.945
and no one sent
a search party after us.

27:33.987 --> 27:36.031
- Well, she didn't grow up
on this ranch.

27:36.072 --> 27:37.824
- Right. She grew up
in a mansion with a maid

27:37.866 --> 27:39.284
serving her breakfast.

27:39.325 --> 27:41.077
- Okay, she didn't ask
to be born into that life.

27:41.119 --> 27:43.163
And she's not prepared
for whatever's out here.

27:47.500 --> 27:49.127
- I feel sick about this.
- Missy--

27:49.169 --> 27:51.546
- No, I was blabbing
on and on because--

27:51.588 --> 27:53.089
- I should have mentioned
something to you.

27:53.131 --> 27:55.091
Sophie hasn't been having
an easy time at home.

27:55.133 --> 27:57.010
My sister Laura,
she's been dating somebody

27:57.052 --> 27:59.179
for about six months and now
they're talking marriage.

27:59.220 --> 28:00.805
That's part of why
I wanted to bring her out

28:00.847 --> 28:02.265
to the ranch today.

28:02.307 --> 28:04.601
I don't know, she seems
to love it here so much,

28:04.642 --> 28:06.186
maybe she doesn't wanna leave.

28:07.854 --> 28:10.106
- The treehouse. Wait,
I was telling Sophie

28:10.148 --> 28:12.192
about the treehouse
that I used to sleep in

28:12.233 --> 28:13.443
when I would run away.

28:13.485 --> 28:15.195
You stay here,
in case I'm wrong.

28:16.029 --> 28:17.989
Come one.
(tongue clicking)

28:18.031 --> 28:19.366
Let's go.

28:21.368 --> 28:23.161
(fast-paced music)

28:26.206 --> 28:27.832
Sophie!

28:29.417 --> 28:31.461
Sophie!
(tongue clicking)

28:31.503 --> 28:33.213
Whoa, whoa.

28:36.091 --> 28:37.634
Sophie?

28:37.676 --> 28:39.469
Come here, boy, come here.

28:41.012 --> 28:44.182
Sophie, if you're up there,
just stay put, okay? I'm coming.

28:44.224 --> 28:46.267
- I'm up here!

28:46.309 --> 28:47.977
(soft music)

28:49.688 --> 28:51.690
- There you are!

28:51.731 --> 28:53.441
You had us all worried,
little miss!

28:53.483 --> 28:55.276
Are you hurt?

28:55.318 --> 28:56.986
No?

28:57.028 --> 28:58.863
I gotta get you back home, Soph.

28:58.905 --> 29:01.116
- I don't wanna go home.

29:03.451 --> 29:05.495
- You know...

29:05.537 --> 29:07.247
Your uncle Gus,

29:07.288 --> 29:09.541
he told me that your mom
is getting married.

29:09.582 --> 29:11.167
It's excited.

29:11.209 --> 29:12.502
- Not for my dad.

29:13.920 --> 29:15.797
- Yeah, I know it's hard.

29:15.839 --> 29:18.008
My parents split up too,
you know?

29:18.049 --> 29:20.093
And I loved both my mom and dad,

29:20.135 --> 29:22.846
but they just didn't seem to
like each other all that much.

29:25.473 --> 29:27.809
The thing about parents

29:27.851 --> 29:31.438
is that they need you
as much as you need them.

29:31.938 --> 29:33.815
And running away...

29:33.857 --> 29:37.569
That only makes them scared
and if you run away a lot,

29:37.610 --> 29:41.114
that scared feeling
might never go away.

29:43.658 --> 29:46.286
- I don't want them
to be scared.

29:46.953 --> 29:49.456
- Yeah, I know you don't.

29:54.336 --> 29:56.296
(**)

29:56.338 --> 29:58.506
(indistinct mumbling)

29:58.548 --> 30:00.508
- Be safe, be safe...
- Uncle Gus!

30:00.550 --> 30:03.386
- You, come here!
Oh my gosh!

30:03.428 --> 30:05.263
I'm so glad you're safe.

30:05.305 --> 30:07.891
Made me worried sick. Ah!

30:07.932 --> 30:09.684
Thank you.
- Yeah, of course.

30:09.726 --> 30:11.561
- I'm sorry.
- No, don't be.

30:11.603 --> 30:12.896
I had a good time.

30:12.937 --> 30:14.647
Given the circumstances.

30:14.689 --> 30:16.191
- Yes, so did I.

30:17.609 --> 30:20.528
I'd like to see you again.
If you're okay with that.

30:21.529 --> 30:22.822
- Oh, thank God!

30:22.864 --> 30:24.866
Oh, are you okay?

30:24.908 --> 30:27.869
We were so worried about you.
Where did you go?

30:27.911 --> 30:29.788
- To the treehouse!
(laughing)

30:29.829 --> 30:32.415
- Hey! Missy,
glad you found her.

30:32.457 --> 30:33.500
Goldie foaled.

30:33.541 --> 30:35.794
- I should get Sophie back.

30:35.835 --> 30:37.629
- I'm gonna--
- I'll be there in a second.

30:37.671 --> 30:39.464
- Let's go.
- Uh, hey.

30:39.506 --> 30:41.508
Um...

30:41.549 --> 30:45.011
I would be okay
seeing you again.

30:45.804 --> 30:48.264
(chuckling)

30:48.306 --> 30:50.350
- Did you hear that?
(Sophie laughing)

30:51.726 --> 30:53.395
I say, you hear that?!

30:53.436 --> 30:55.188
(soft music)

30:57.607 --> 30:59.150
- See?

30:59.192 --> 31:01.736
Sometimes, doing nothing's
the best thing you can do.

31:01.778 --> 31:05.323
- Yeah. I know.

31:06.533 --> 31:07.867
Mmm.

31:09.869 --> 31:11.287
But I am not getting
in the hammock anytime soon.

31:11.329 --> 31:14.207
- I got it covered.
(laughing)

31:14.249 --> 31:16.251
- At least someone's
enjoying it.

31:16.292 --> 31:18.128
- I...

31:18.169 --> 31:20.213
I don't believe we've met.

31:20.255 --> 31:24.968
- Mom, this is Julian.
Julian, this is my mother.

31:25.010 --> 31:26.720
- Happy birthday, Mrs. McMurray.

31:26.761 --> 31:28.388
- You can call me Isabel.

31:30.724 --> 31:32.350
- Alright, should we start
figuring out

31:32.392 --> 31:34.269
what we're gonna do about--
- No, I don't want anything.

31:34.310 --> 31:36.604
No presents or nothing.
- I just meant food.

31:36.646 --> 31:37.939
- Food, Mom.
(clears throat)

31:37.981 --> 31:39.524
- Oh. Okay.
(laughing)

31:39.566 --> 31:41.317
Well, let me see what I have.

31:41.359 --> 31:43.403
- I can always eat.

31:45.905 --> 31:48.825
- Ah, this day,
such a crazy day.

31:48.867 --> 31:52.370
(singing together):
Happy birthday to you!

31:52.412 --> 31:55.457
Happy birthday to you!

31:55.498 --> 31:56.875
- Stop, stop, stop singing!

31:56.916 --> 31:58.585
I can handle the cake,
just not the song.

31:58.626 --> 32:00.462
- Okay, but at least
make a wish.

32:00.503 --> 32:02.130
- Make it a good one.

32:04.215 --> 32:05.383
- Mmm.

32:09.679 --> 32:11.056
(cheering)

32:11.097 --> 32:12.724
- You must have wished
for flowers!

32:12.766 --> 32:14.142
These are from all of us.

32:14.184 --> 32:16.144
- And there's plenty
of food too.

32:16.186 --> 32:18.772
- I wish you didn't do this.

32:18.813 --> 32:22.192
But I am glad you did. I...
- Aww...

32:22.233 --> 32:24.861
- Thank you.
- Happy birthday, Mama.

32:24.903 --> 32:27.489
- To the best mom
anyone could ask for.

32:27.530 --> 32:29.866
- To the woman who taught me
how to ranch, how to hunt,

32:29.908 --> 32:31.409
how to be stubborn.
- Oh yeah.

32:31.451 --> 32:33.912
- And to the woman who gave me
the best home I ever had.

32:33.953 --> 32:35.497
(chuckling)
- Cheers!

32:35.538 --> 32:37.707
- Hey, happy birthday, Mom.
- Thank you.

32:37.749 --> 32:39.292
Connie.

32:46.925 --> 32:49.678
(laughing, indistinct chatter)
- Yeah, it was a hard drive.

32:49.719 --> 32:51.179
Great party.

32:51.221 --> 32:52.472
Happy birthday.

32:52.514 --> 32:54.391
- It's been a long time, Connie.

32:54.432 --> 32:57.477
It's nice of you to stop by.

32:57.519 --> 33:00.271
- Glad my daughter invited me
to the ranch for once.

33:02.482 --> 33:04.359
- You know,
you're always welcome.

33:04.401 --> 33:06.111
- Yeah, that's what
she kept saying.

33:06.152 --> 33:08.154
(Valeria): Want to bring
those balloons over here?

33:08.196 --> 33:10.156
- Look at her.
She's still standing strong

33:10.198 --> 33:11.449
after all this time.

33:11.491 --> 33:13.535
After all she's been through.

33:13.576 --> 33:15.537
You must have done
something right.

33:16.454 --> 33:18.540
- You're sure that was me,
not you?

33:19.582 --> 33:23.294
- Come on, now. We both know
how hard it is to be a mom.

33:23.336 --> 33:25.422
No need to keep score.

33:25.463 --> 33:27.924
- Easy to say when
you're the one who's winning.

33:29.843 --> 33:31.970
- Alright, look. Um...

33:32.012 --> 33:34.222
Can I offer you a beer?
Come on in.

33:34.264 --> 33:36.224
- Uh, white wine.

33:37.225 --> 33:38.685
- Uh, okay.

33:40.020 --> 33:42.355
(indistinct chatter)

33:42.397 --> 33:44.733
- Isabel. Isabel, I'm so sorry,

33:44.774 --> 33:46.568
I did not think she was gonna--
- It's fine!

33:46.609 --> 33:48.903
- It's not fine. I didn't mean
to ruin your birthday

33:48.945 --> 33:51.698
more than I already have.
- You didn't ruin anything.

33:51.740 --> 33:54.534
And neither did she.
Look, it's nice that she came.

33:54.576 --> 33:58.371
Besides, a little birdie told me
it's good to let people

33:58.413 --> 34:00.540
do nice things for you
every once in a while

34:00.582 --> 34:03.501
Here. Go talk to your mama.

34:03.543 --> 34:05.545
- She's not coming over here
to talk to me.

34:05.587 --> 34:08.089
- Somebody needs to make
the first move.

34:08.131 --> 34:09.716
Go. Go.

34:09.758 --> 34:10.967
(sighing)

34:12.886 --> 34:14.387
- Mom.

34:14.429 --> 34:16.181
Hey.

34:16.222 --> 34:17.766
I'm glad you came.

34:19.267 --> 34:20.894
- You never were
very good at fibbing.

34:20.935 --> 34:23.021
- I'm not fibbing.

34:24.105 --> 34:25.732
You don't think I miss you?

34:25.774 --> 34:27.400
- Darling, you've been trying
to run away from me

34:27.442 --> 34:29.110
since you were
old enough to walk.

34:29.152 --> 34:31.571
- Just because I ran
to this ranch,

34:31.613 --> 34:33.740
doesn't mean I was
running away from you.

34:33.782 --> 34:35.950
- I poured everything
I had into you.

34:36.868 --> 34:38.995
I gave you every option.
- Except for this one.

34:39.037 --> 34:40.622
- Except for this one.

34:40.663 --> 34:42.415
- And that's the problem, Mom.

34:42.457 --> 34:44.501
You can't just love 99 % of me.

34:44.542 --> 34:47.462
You have to love all of me
or it doesn't feel like love.

34:47.504 --> 34:49.506
- Of course I love all of you.

34:50.507 --> 34:52.092
(sighing)
When you married Austin,

34:52.133 --> 34:53.635
I kept my mouth shut.

34:53.677 --> 34:55.178
When he died,
I went to the funeral

34:55.220 --> 34:56.638
and I kept my mouth shut.

34:57.972 --> 35:01.518
No parent wants to see
their kid in that much pain.

35:02.310 --> 35:04.437
I just wanted
to be there for you.

35:06.815 --> 35:09.651
And you cried
on Isabel's shoulder.

35:10.318 --> 35:12.445
- Mom, I...

35:12.487 --> 35:14.656
I don't know what to say.

35:14.698 --> 35:16.866
We were both grieving Austin.

35:16.908 --> 35:18.702
She had just lost her child.

35:20.120 --> 35:21.830
- Yeah.

35:21.871 --> 35:24.082
And there's no worse pain.

35:27.627 --> 35:29.796
I should go. Long drive back.

35:29.838 --> 35:34.092
- Oh. Oh, okay,
I'll walk you out.

35:34.134 --> 35:36.011
- I need a car wash
and a realignment

35:36.052 --> 35:37.762
every time I make this trip.

35:37.804 --> 35:39.931
- Yeah, that's why
God invented trucks.

35:39.973 --> 35:41.558
(scoffing)
- Yeah.

35:42.642 --> 35:45.478
I know you don't want my advice,
but as long as you're here,

35:45.520 --> 35:47.439
I am worried that you're always

35:47.480 --> 35:48.982
gonna be in the shadow
of a McMurray.

35:50.108 --> 35:51.693
- Mom.

35:51.735 --> 35:53.028
I...

36:00.910 --> 36:02.037
Drive safe.

36:02.078 --> 36:04.622
(soft music)

36:10.170 --> 36:12.714
(engine starting)

36:13.757 --> 36:17.552
- About what I said at poker,
I'm...

36:18.386 --> 36:20.013
I'm not keeping my options open.

36:20.055 --> 36:23.099
I mean, it's not like
I have a girl in every town.

36:24.267 --> 36:25.852
- That's cool, I mean,
you can if you want.

36:25.894 --> 36:27.270
No one's stopping you.

36:27.312 --> 36:28.605
- I don't like that look
in your eyes.

36:28.646 --> 36:31.191
- She's got her hooks in him.

36:31.232 --> 36:32.776
- Her hooks?

36:32.817 --> 36:34.152
- I can't help it.

36:36.321 --> 36:38.490
I'll be right back.
- Tuff.

36:39.491 --> 36:41.785
(indistinct chatter, laughing)

36:44.162 --> 36:46.081
- That's why I like them.
- Carrots?

36:46.122 --> 36:49.542
(laughing)
- Anyway. Hmm...

36:49.584 --> 36:52.087
- Well. I guess I should be
hitting home.

36:52.128 --> 36:55.882
- Oh. Uh,
thank you for everything.

36:55.924 --> 36:58.009
Um... And you were right.

36:58.051 --> 37:00.095
I did need a distraction.

37:01.262 --> 37:02.806
- I think I needed one too.

37:04.766 --> 37:07.143
Well...

37:07.185 --> 37:08.311
Happy birthday, Isabel.

37:08.353 --> 37:09.813
- Thanks.

37:11.439 --> 37:13.358
- You know what? Um...

37:13.400 --> 37:15.235
I think I'll follow you out.

37:15.276 --> 37:17.904
- Just gonna check on Goldie.
I know what you're doing.

37:17.946 --> 37:19.406
- Yes, I am. Yes, I am!

37:19.447 --> 37:20.740
- You don't have
to explain yourself.

37:20.782 --> 37:22.742
- I know, I know, I just...

37:22.784 --> 37:24.327
I um...

37:24.369 --> 37:27.330
I'm not usually very good at...

37:27.372 --> 37:30.083
(sighing)

37:30.125 --> 37:32.293
I like to have fun.

37:32.335 --> 37:33.920
I like to laugh.

37:33.962 --> 37:35.672
(laughing)

37:35.714 --> 37:37.716
- Yeah, I like to laugh too.

37:40.010 --> 37:43.346
- So yeah, I think we should,
you know,

37:43.388 --> 37:45.306
we should go mud-bogging again.

37:45.348 --> 37:47.350
- Okay. Let's go mud-bogging.

37:47.392 --> 37:49.436
- Val, it's time we talk.

37:49.477 --> 37:53.481
- Uh, can it wait?
- No, it can't.

37:53.523 --> 37:55.650
- Just, you know,
a little later, Tuff.

37:59.738 --> 38:02.115
What are... What are these?

38:02.157 --> 38:03.742
Fake IDs? What is...

38:04.659 --> 38:06.286
- You had no right
to go through my stuff.

38:06.327 --> 38:08.288
- Yeah, maybe not.

38:08.329 --> 38:10.665
But we've been through too
much for me not to do everything

38:10.707 --> 38:12.959
I can to protect this family.

38:13.001 --> 38:15.003
(tense music)

38:20.884 --> 38:22.302
- Hey, Tuff.
- She lied to us

38:22.344 --> 38:24.679
about Tucker Clarke,
you won't believe a word I say,

38:24.721 --> 38:26.473
what am I supposed to do?

38:26.514 --> 38:28.558
A whole year and she won't
say one word

38:28.600 --> 38:30.643
about where she's been
and now this?

38:30.685 --> 38:32.145
She owes us an explanation.

38:32.187 --> 38:34.606
- An explanation about what?
- What's going on?

38:34.647 --> 38:37.567
- Nothing. This is between
Cash, Valeria and I.

38:37.609 --> 38:39.986
- No, she should hear this.
You all should.

38:40.028 --> 38:41.946
I mean, I left you all
in the lurch, right?

38:41.988 --> 38:44.282
Least I could do
is give you an explanation.

38:49.996 --> 38:52.749
I was in dept to Tucker Clarke.

38:53.458 --> 38:56.169
- Tucker Clarke?
- What kind of dept?

38:56.211 --> 38:58.296
- Gambling, I...

38:58.338 --> 38:59.923
Poker.

39:01.049 --> 39:02.676
He was getting angry.
That's why I had to leave

39:02.717 --> 39:03.927
the way that I did.

39:03.968 --> 39:06.221
- Why didn't you just
tell us, V?

39:07.222 --> 39:09.057
- I was ashamed.

39:09.099 --> 39:12.644
- Why fake IDs?
- Wait, fake IDs?

39:12.686 --> 39:14.562
- Look, I used them
on the road, okay?

39:14.604 --> 39:16.106
I didn't want Tucker to find me

39:16.147 --> 39:18.400
before I could get
the cash to pay him back.

39:19.567 --> 39:21.736
- Okay, well,
are you still in debt?

39:22.570 --> 39:24.656
- No. No, I...

39:25.365 --> 39:27.867
I spent the last year
earning enough to pay him.

39:29.703 --> 39:32.872
Look, I only play
for beer money, now, I swear.

39:34.165 --> 39:36.209
- Alright.

39:36.251 --> 39:38.169
- I'm sorry that you felt

39:38.211 --> 39:40.255
like you had to hide
all this from us.

39:41.172 --> 39:44.259
And I'm sorry that it had
to come out this way.

39:48.179 --> 39:49.931
Everything's out
in the open now.

39:51.933 --> 39:54.644
It's okay, it's okay, come here.

39:54.686 --> 39:56.896
(breathing shakily)

39:59.232 --> 40:01.776
(soft music)

40:18.209 --> 40:19.502
(maid): Estella!

40:19.544 --> 40:20.670
Miss Estella!

40:20.712 --> 40:22.297
- Coming!

40:26.760 --> 40:29.304
(soft piano music)

40:49.866 --> 40:51.701
- She's ready to see you.

40:51.743 --> 40:53.828
(sighing)

40:54.871 --> 40:57.457
(**)

41:13.515 --> 41:15.183
- I love you, Mommy.

41:15.975 --> 41:18.019
- I love you too, mija.

41:18.978 --> 41:21.231
(crying softly)

41:23.525 --> 41:25.568
(**)

41:31.658 --> 41:34.869
(sighing)

41:36.788 --> 41:38.873
(soft piano music)

41:38.915 --> 41:41.543
Subtitling: difuze
