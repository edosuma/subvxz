- NO, I THINK I'M GOOD.

00:13.400 --> 00:15.767
- OH, I HAVE A QUESTION, DOC.
- OKAY, EMMA.

00:16.000 --> 00:18.166

MAGGIE'S DELIVERY

00:18.200 --> 00:20.567
IS THAT THERE BE, UM--

MINIMAL VAGINAL DESTRUCTION.

00:23.600 --> 00:26.567
BECAUSE SOMEONE ONCE TOLD ME
THAT BEFORE LABOR,

00:26.600 --> 00:30.000
YOUR VAGINA LOOKS LIKE,
YOU KNOW, LIKE A NEW ROSE WITH--

00:30.033 --> 00:32.033
OPENING TO THE MORNING SUN.

00:32.066 --> 00:33.467
- OH, LIKE THE ROSE
FROM BEAUTY AND THE BEAST...

00:33.500 --> 00:34.767
- EXACTLY.

00:35.000 --> 00:36.300
- WHERE JUST, LIKE,
ONE PETAL FALLS OFF AT A TIME.

00:36.333 --> 00:38.633
- YEAH, "TALE AS OLD AS TIME,
SONG AS OLD AS RHYME,"

00:38.667 --> 00:41.467

IT CAN LOOK LIKE THAT PLANT

00:43.233 --> 00:44.667
- OKAY, THAT'S NOT TRUE.
- YEAH.

00:44.700 --> 00:46.734
THAT IS TRUE, AND IT'S REAL,

OBVIOUSLY, IT IS NEVER MY GOAL

00:55.100 --> 00:56.333

00:56.367 --> 00:58.133
- THAT'S GREAT.
- THAT'S GOOD TO HEAR.

00:58.166 --> 01:00.467

SERVED FOCUSING ON THE FACT THAT

01:00.500 --> 01:02.400
THE BABY COULD COME
AT ANY TIME NOW.

01:02.433 --> 01:05.233
- I'M SORRY,
WHAT DO YOU--WHAT?

01:05.266 --> 01:07.200
- WE'RE AT THE 37TH WEEK
OF PREGNANCY,

01:07.233 --> 01:10.367
WHICH MEANS THE BABY COULD
SAFELY ARRIVE AT ANY MOMENT.

01:10.400 --> 01:14.066
- OKAY, BUT I'LL PROBABLY GO TO,
LIKE, 40 OR 41 WEEKS, RIGHT?

01:14.100 --> 01:18.467
- WELL, MAYBE, MAYBE NOT.

01:18.500 --> 01:20.200

RODRIGUEZ GRAND PLAN, YOU KNOW?

07:43.166 --> 07:45.734
MARRIED BY 23,
ON THE FORCE BY 25,

07:45.767 --> 07:47.500
PAINT, WIPE, TRIM,
PAINT, TRIM--

07:47.533 --> 07:49.367
- IT'S WIPE, TAPE, PRIME,
TRIM, AND THEN PAINT!

07:49.400 --> 07:51.200
- ALL RIGHT, WELL, YOU KNOW
WHAT, I JUST PAINT, OKAY?

07:51.233 --> 07:52.467
I DON'T NEED
ANY OF THAT OTHER BUSINESS!

07:52.500 --> 07:54.066
- OKAY, THEN LET'S JUST DO IT
YOUR WAY THEN!

07:54.100 --> 07:55.567
- GREAT! THAT'D BE GREAT.
- LET'S JUST DO IT YOUR WAY.

07:55.600 --> 07:56.567
- WE'LL JUST
START PAINTING HERE.

07:56.600 --> 07:57.667
- OH, SEE?
THAT LOOKS REALLY GOOD.

07:57.700 --> 07:58.667
- AND THEN WE'LL JUST
PAINT HERE.

07:58.700 --> 07:59.667
- CAN I HELP?

07:59.700 --> 08:00.734
- OH, BY ALL MEANS,
PLEASE HELP!

08:00.767 --> 08:02.266
- YEAH, HOW ABOUT THAT?
DOES THAT WORK?

08:02.300 --> 08:03.600
- LET'S JUST GO HERE!
YEAH, WE'RE JUST PAINTING AWAY.

08:03.633 --> 08:04.600
- YEAH!
- PAINTING AWAY!

08:04.633 --> 08:08.266
- [gasps]

08:08.300 --> 08:10.367
WHAT?

08:17.500 --> 08:18.633
MAGGIE, MAGGIE, WE'RE--
- MAGGIE--

08:18.667 --> 08:20.333
- NO, NO, NO, NO
NO WORDS FROM YOU!

08:20.367 --> 08:22.567
- WE WERE JUST--
- [shushing]

08:22.600 --> 08:24.066
NOT A PEEP!

08:24.100 --> 08:25.533
- I JUST--
- YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SICK OF?

08:25.567 --> 08:28.567
IS ALL
YOUR JABBER-JABBER, OKAY?

08:28.600 --> 08:30.700
BOTH OF YOU NEED
TO GET OVER IT ALREADY!

08:30.734 --> 08:32.333
MAKE UP!
NOBODY CARES!

08:32.367 --> 08:33.767
- OKAY, ALL RIGHT.

08:34.000 --> 08:35.367
- I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU'RE GONNA
GET THIS WHOLE HOUSE PAINTED

08:35.400 --> 08:38.033
IF YOU DON'T DO THAT!
- WAIT, THE WHOLE HOUSE?

08:38.066 --> 08:40.066
- IN ONE WEEKEND?
THAT'S TOO MUCH, EVEN FOR VILA!

08:40.100 --> 08:42.266
- WELL, I DON'T CARE, OKAY?

08:42.300 --> 08:45.066
YOU HAVE TO,
'CAUSE THIS BABY IS COMING,

08:45.100 --> 08:47.200
AND SHE CAN'T BE IN THIS
HOUSE IF THERE'S PAINT FUMES,

08:47.233 --> 08:49.400
AND I NEED TO LIVE IN THE HOUSE
WHERE MY BABY LIVES!

08:49.433 --> 08:52.500
I WANT MY BABY TO HERE WITH ME
IN MY HOUSE, WHERE I LIVE!

08:52.533 --> 08:55.166
- OKAY, MAGGIE, WE'RE GOING TO
PAINT THE WHOLE HOUSE.

08:55.200 --> 08:56.300
- ABSOLUTELY.

08:56.333 --> 08:58.367
YEAH, I LOOK FORWARD
TO THE CHALLENGE.

08:58.400 --> 09:00.166
- WELL, GET ON THE GETS!

09:01.767 --> 09:04.467
- AND AFTER PACKING THE ROOM
AND CLEARING THE WORK AREA,

09:04.500 --> 09:07.166
SO TO SPEAK, LET'S NOT FORGET
THE FIVE-STEP PROCESS

09:07.200 --> 09:09.233
OF WIPE, TAPE, PRIME,

09:09.266 --> 09:10.734
TRIM, AND THEN--
- [snoring]

09:10.767 --> 09:13.734
SORRY, WHAT?
I'M SORRY.

09:13.767 --> 09:15.200
- LET'S JUST KEEP IT TIDY.

09:15.233 --> 09:17.734
- CAN I SAY A FEW WORDS?
- YEAH.

09:17.767 --> 09:20.400
- I JUST WANT TO THANK EVERYBODY
FOR BEING HERE, 'CAUSE IT--

09:20.433 --> 09:21.734
- OKAY.
- I'M SORRY.

09:21.767 --> 09:23.467
- WHY ARE WE CRYING?

09:23.500 --> 09:25.700
- IT'S JUST MY DREAM IS REALLY
COMING TRUE RIGHT NOW,

09:25.734 --> 09:27.333
'CAUSE EVERYBODY'S COMING
TOGETHER.

09:27.367 --> 09:28.333
- I KNOW.

09:28.367 --> 09:30.166
- WHAT THE HELL IS SHE SAYING?

09:30.200 --> 09:32.066
- SOMETHING ABOUT DREAMS,
AND THAT IT TAKES A VILLAGE--

09:32.100 --> 09:34.467
- FOR THE LOVE OF THE BABY.

09:34.500 --> 09:36.266
- FOR THE LOVE OF THE BABY--
- IT REALLY--

09:36.300 --> 09:37.734
- IT MEANS A LOT TO YOU,
I KNOW, I KNOW.

09:37.767 --> 09:40.033
OKAY, SO DID WE GET THAT,
EVERYONE?

09:40.066 --> 09:42.033
ALL RIGHT, THANK YOU, VILLAGE.
ALL RIGHT.

09:42.066 --> 09:43.066
LET'S GET TO WORK.

09:43.100 --> 09:44.567
- AND, TO REITERATE: WIPE,
TAPE--

09:44.600 --> 09:45.567
- OH, MY GOD.

09:45.600 --> 09:47.033
- PRIME, TRIM--
- I CAN'T.

09:47.066 --> 09:50.033
I CAN'T.
- AND THEN PAINT.

09:50.066 --> 09:52.533
- MAGGIE, ARE YOU SURE YOU WANT
TO DO THIS?

09:52.567 --> 09:55.600
- PUT A BABY MONITOR
IN THE NURSERY?

09:55.633 --> 09:57.567
YES, MR. NAJIANI,
I AM SURE.

09:57.600 --> 10:00.333
SO COULD YOU JUST PUT THIS
CAMERA IN THE BABY'S ROOM,

10:00.367 --> 10:02.734
AND THEN IT SHOULD COME UP
ON MY COMPUTER IN HERE.

10:02.767 --> 10:04.467
- OKAY, BUT YOU'RE CREATING

10:04.500 --> 10:06.667
SOME VERY UNHEALTHY HABITS
IN YOUR CHILD'S LIFE.

10:06.700 --> 10:08.767
- HOW'S THAT?

10:09.000 --> 10:11.400
- IT'S ALWAYS GOING TO EXPECT TO
BE LOOKED AT AND LISTENED TO.

10:11.433 --> 10:14.400
THAT'S HOW.

10:14.433 --> 10:19.200
HELLO!
CAN YOU HEAR ME?

10:19.233 --> 10:20.767
- OKAY, YES,
I CAN HEAR YOU, MR. NAJIANI,

10:21.000 --> 10:23.066
BUT ONLY BECAUSE
YOU'RE SHOUTING.

10:23.100 --> 10:24.467
- OH.
HOW ABOUT NOW?

10:24.500 --> 10:27.000
I'M MAGGIE'S BABY.
[screams like a baby]

10:27.033 --> 10:28.533
- OH, YES, IT'S WORKING.
IT'S WORKING!

10:28.567 --> 10:30.166
- GOOD.

10:30.200 --> 10:33.400
NOW YOU CAN SEE ALL THE WAYS
YOUR BABY CAN INJURE HERSELF.

10:33.433 --> 10:35.600
LOOK AT ME.
I'M MAGGIE'S BABY.

10:35.633 --> 10:38.633
I'M GOING TO PUT MY WET FINGER
INSIDE AN ELECTRICAL OUTLET.

10:38.667 --> 10:40.166
[screams]

10:40.200 --> 10:42.133
- OKAY, WELL, OBVIOUSLY,
I HAVEN'T--

10:42.166 --> 10:45.133
I HAVEN'T BABY-PROOFED
YET, OKAY?

10:45.166 --> 10:47.000
- OH, MY EYEBALL!
WHERE'S MY EYEBALL?

10:47.033 --> 10:48.433
- OKAY, THANK YOU,
MR. NAJIANI.

10:48.467 --> 10:49.734
I GET IT.

10:49.767 --> 10:52.734
- I CAN'T HEAR YOU!
ARE THERE SCISSORS IN MY EAR?

10:52.767 --> 10:55.567
[screams]

11:06.333 --> 11:08.600
- I'M ALMOST DONE WITH THE
TAPERED BRUSH IF YOU NEED IT.

11:08.633 --> 11:11.166
- THANKS.

11:11.200 --> 11:13.166
NICE WORK ON THOSE CORNERS,
BY THE WAY.

11:13.200 --> 11:16.066
- OH, THANKS.
IF I HADN'T TAPED IT UP

11:16.100 --> 11:18.767
LIKE YOU SAID,
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A REAL MESS.

11:19.000 --> 11:22.333
- THAT TAPE'S A...
VERY IMPORTANT TOOL.

11:22.367 --> 11:25.033
- REALLY IS AN IMPORTANT TOOL.

11:25.066 --> 11:28.033
IMPORTANT TOOL OF THE TRADE.

11:30.633 --> 11:32.700
- YOU KNOW, I WOULD HAVE GONE
TO CHINA WITH YOU.

11:32.734 --> 11:36.300
- WHAT?

11:36.333 --> 11:39.066
- YOU JUST NEVER ASKED.

11:39.100 --> 11:42.166
- WAIT, WHY DIDN'T YOU EVER
SAY ANYTHING?

11:42.200 --> 11:44.633
- WELL, BECAUSE I ASKED YOU
TO MARRY ME,

11:44.667 --> 11:46.300
AND THEN YOU LEFT TOWN
THE NEXT DAY,

11:46.333 --> 11:47.533
AND NEVER CALLED ME AGAIN,

11:47.567 --> 11:48.667
SO IT SEEMED LIKE YOU
DIDN'T WANT TO TALK.

11:48.700 --> 11:50.133
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

11:50.166 --> 11:51.734
YOU--YOU NEVER WOULD HAVE
LEFT THIS PLACE.

11:51.767 --> 11:53.233
YOU ALWAYS SAID THAT PINEBROOK
WAS IT FOR YOU.

11:53.266 --> 11:55.367
- YOU WERE IT FOR ME.

11:55.400 --> 11:59.066
THAT--AT THE TIME.

11:59.100 --> 12:01.066
IT'S FINE NOW.

12:01.100 --> 12:03.066
- I JUST THOUGHT--
- YEAH, SEE, THAT'S THE PROBLEM,

12:03.100 --> 12:06.467
IS YOU THOUGHT, YOU NEVER ASKED,
SO DON'T PAINT ME AS A PERSON

12:06.500 --> 12:08.600
WHO'S NOT OPEN TO, YOU KNOW,
OTHER EXPERIENCES.

12:08.633 --> 12:10.367
OBVIOUSLY, IT ALL
WORKED OUT FOR THE BEST,

12:10.400 --> 12:12.000
BUT JUST TO LET
THE RECORD SHOW.

12:12.033 --> 12:14.700
- NO, OBVIOUSLY, IT WORKED
OUT FOR THE BEST.

12:17.467 --> 12:18.700
I'M SORRY, OKAY?

12:18.734 --> 12:21.767
- WAIT, WHAT?

12:22.000 --> 12:25.233
- YOU HEARD ME.

12:25.266 --> 12:26.667
- I'M SORRY,
I HAVE TO GRAB THIS.

12:26.700 --> 12:31.066
I GOTTA GET COMFORTABLE.
- ARE YOU DONE?

12:31.100 --> 12:33.633
- NO, BECAUSE THIS...
THIS IS A REAL MOMENT,

12:33.667 --> 12:36.333
AND I'M GOING TO HAVE TO HEAR
YOU SAY IT AGAIN.

12:38.700 --> 12:39.667
- I'M SORRY.
AHEM.

12:39.700 --> 12:42.433
- WHAT?
I COULDN'T HEAR YOU.

12:42.467 --> 12:43.633
- I'M SORRY.

12:43.667 --> 12:45.734
- ONE MORE TIME.
I'M GOING TO HAVE TO SAVOR THIS.

12:45.767 --> 12:50.133
- YOU'RE REALLY CLOSE TO MY FACE
RIGHT NOW, JUST SO YOU KNOW.

12:50.166 --> 12:51.734
- I BROUGHT MY FAMOUS
PROTEIN WRAPS!

12:51.767 --> 12:53.533
- TINA!
- TINA!

12:53.567 --> 12:55.100
- HEY, EVERYBODY,
IT'S MY WIFE, TINA!

12:55.133 --> 12:56.433
- HEY, GIRL!
- HEY!

12:56.467 --> 12:58.100
- OH, MY GOODNESS,
LOOK AT THIS!

12:58.133 --> 12:59.633
OH, THESE ARE THE BEST
WRAPS EVER, BABE.

12:59.667 --> 13:01.633
BEST WRAPS EVER MADE.
- IS THIS THE COUPON MEAT?

13:01.667 --> 13:03.300
- THESE ARE GREAT! MMM.
- MMM.

13:14.266 --> 13:19.433
- YOU, UM,
YOU NEED TO WEAR IT HIGHER UP,

13:19.467 --> 13:21.533
ESPECIALLY WHEN YOUR LAMP
IS A NEWBORN.

13:21.567 --> 13:23.433
- OH.
- [laughs]

13:23.467 --> 13:25.066
- HOW DO YOU KNOW
ALL THIS STUFF?

13:25.100 --> 13:26.734
- OH, YOU KNOW
"THE BABYSITTER CLUB" BOOKS?

13:26.767 --> 13:28.033
- UH-HUH.

13:28.066 --> 13:29.567
- THOSE ARE LOOSELY BASED
ON MY LIFE.

13:29.600 --> 13:31.233
- OH, TINA, WHAT?

13:31.266 --> 13:33.600
- NO, THE KRISTY CHARACTER WAS
BASED ON ME, ALTHOUGH I ALWAYS

13:33.633 --> 13:36.367
THOUGHT OF MYSELF AS MORE OF
A NON-ASIAN CLAUDIA KISHI.

13:36.400 --> 13:37.567
- UH-HUH.

13:37.600 --> 13:39.133
- I WOULD HAVE SUED,
BUT, YOU KNOW, I WAS 14

13:39.166 --> 13:41.500
AND RUNNING A SMALL
CHILD CARE EMPIRE.

13:41.533 --> 13:42.700
[both laugh]

13:42.734 --> 13:44.400
BUT YOU'VE BABYSAT BEFORE,
RIGHT?

13:44.433 --> 13:46.667
- OH, NOT REALLY.
- OH.

13:46.700 --> 13:48.734
I WAS GOING TO SAY
THAT IT'S GOOD EXPERIENCE,

13:48.767 --> 13:50.433
BUT I GUESS
IT'S TOO LATE FOR THAT.

13:50.467 --> 13:51.767
[chuckles]
- YEP.

13:52.000 --> 13:53.033
[both laugh]

13:53.066 --> 13:54.100
- NOW THAT WE HAVE FIXED
YOUR PROBLEM,

13:54.133 --> 13:56.166
CAN I ASK YOU A QUESTION?

13:56.200 --> 13:57.166
- YEAH, WHAT IS IT?

13:57.200 --> 13:59.500
- DOES EMMA NOT LIKE ME?

13:59.533 --> 14:02.100
- WHAT? NO!
NO, NO, NO, NO.

14:02.133 --> 14:04.033
- SHE'S ALWAYS SO WEIRD
AROUND ME.

14:04.066 --> 14:05.300
- OH, WELL, THAT'S NOT YOU.

14:05.333 --> 14:08.033
THAT'S JUST AWKWARDNESS
BETWEEN HER AND MARK,

14:08.066 --> 14:09.700
YOU KNOW, 'CAUSE OF WHEN
THEY WERE ENGAGED.

14:09.734 --> 14:11.700
- THEY WEREN'T ENGAGED.
- OH, RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT.

14:11.734 --> 14:13.500
NOT TECHNICALLY,
'CAUSE SHE NEVER SAID "YES,"

14:13.533 --> 14:16.266
'CAUSE SHE HOPPED TOWN
TO GET ON THE GET.

14:16.300 --> 14:19.600
- MARK PROPOSED TO EMMA?
- YEAH--

14:19.633 --> 14:22.133
OH, NO.
- MARK?

14:22.166 --> 14:24.433
- TINA? OH!

14:24.467 --> 14:26.066
- I'M ROLLING THE PAINT ON

14:26.100 --> 14:28.100
IN THAT "W" FORMATION
LIKE YOU WANTED,

14:28.133 --> 14:30.300
BUT I JUST WANT TO MAKE
SURE I'M DOING IT CORRECTLY.

14:30.333 --> 14:32.533
- OH.
- [laughs]

14:32.567 --> 14:34.333
- IS THAT A LOUD ENOUGH
"SORRY" FOR YOU?

14:34.367 --> 14:35.400
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

14:35.433 --> 14:36.734
- WELL, 'CAUSE I CAN MAKE IT
BIGGER.

14:36.767 --> 14:38.734
- MARK?

14:38.767 --> 14:41.333
WHY DID YOU NEVER TELL ME
THAT YOU PROPOSED TO EMMA?

14:41.367 --> 14:43.700
- I--HOW DID YOU--

14:51.033 --> 14:52.533
- IT JUST NEVER CAME UP!
LET'S TALK ABOUT IT NOW!

14:52.567 --> 14:54.633
- I CAN'T EVEN!
- I CAN'T--

14:54.667 --> 14:56.600
IT HAPPENED SO LONG AGO!
TINA!

14:56.633 --> 14:58.033
I MOSTLY FORGOT ABOUT IT!

14:58.066 --> 14:59.233
- [screams]
[glass shatters]

14:59.266 --> 15:00.533
- TINA?
- BIRD BONES!

15:00.567 --> 15:01.700
- SHE'S FINE!
SHE'LL BE FINE!

15:01.734 --> 15:03.567
EVERYTHING WILL BE FINE!

15:03.600 --> 15:05.066
- OH, MY GOD.
OH, MY GOD.

15:05.100 --> 15:06.600
- I'M SORRY.
I DIDN'T KNOW SHE DIDN'T KNOW.

15:06.633 --> 15:08.200
- I KNOW.
IT'S SO MUCH WORSE THAN THAT,

15:08.233 --> 15:09.467
BECAUSE THE FIRST TIME
SHE CAME IN,

15:09.500 --> 15:10.567
WE WERE STANDING LIKE THIS.

15:10.600 --> 15:12.066
- WAIT, THIS CLOSE?
WHY?

15:12.100 --> 15:14.033
- BECAUSE HE WAS TELLING ME
THAT IF I HAD ASKED HIM,

15:14.066 --> 15:16.500
HE WOULD HAVE COME
TO CHINA WITH ME.

15:16.533 --> 15:17.633
- OKAY--
- I KNOW!

15:17.667 --> 15:20.533
- HONESTLY, RIGHT NOW, NO!
- BUT YES.

15:20.567 --> 15:22.767
- WE'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO HAVE
ANY SECRETS BETWEEN US.

15:23.000 --> 15:24.033
- I KNOW.
I JUST NEED YOU TO--

15:24.066 --> 15:25.233
IT'S NOT REALLY EVEN A SECRET.

15:25.266 --> 15:26.700
BABY, PLEASE!
I DIDN'T TELL YOU

15:26.734 --> 15:28.100
BECAUSE IT WASN'T
A BIG DEAL!

15:28.133 --> 15:29.700
- HOW MANY PEOPLE KNEW ABOUT
THIS, MARK, HUH?

15:29.734 --> 15:32.300
I MEAN, DID THE WHOLE TOWN KNOW
THAT YOU PROPOSED TO EMMA?

15:32.333 --> 15:33.700
- HE DIDN'T TELL ME.

15:33.734 --> 15:36.433
- HE TOLD ME.
- ME, TOO.

15:36.467 --> 15:39.100
- IS THERE NO ROOM IN THIS HOUSE
WHERE WE CAN GET SOME PRIVACY?

15:39.133 --> 15:40.767
- SWEETIE, NO.
LISTEN, OKAY, BABE, BABE, BABE,

15:41.000 --> 15:43.200
BABE, BABE, BABE--

15:43.233 --> 15:44.500
- MAGS, I FEEL TERRIBLE.

15:44.533 --> 15:45.767
I'M THE REASON THEY'RE
FIGHTING RIGHT NOW.

15:46.000 --> 15:47.233
- OKAY, IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT
HE NEVER TOLD HER.

15:47.266 --> 15:48.467
THAT'S ALL ON HIM, BUDDY.

15:48.500 --> 15:50.000
- I KNOW, BUT MAYBE I SHOULD
GO OUT THERE.

15:50.033 --> 15:51.633
YOU KNOW, JUST, LIKE,
CLEAR THE AIR?

15:51.667 --> 15:53.133
- OKAY, YOU DEFINITELY
SHOULDN'T DO THAT.

15:53.166 --> 15:54.433
- I'M DEFINITELY GONNA DO THAT.
- OKAY, NO, NO, NO.

15:54.467 --> 15:57.300
UGH!

15:57.333 --> 16:01.367
- WHERE'D THEY GO?
[indistinct arguing on laptop]

16:01.400 --> 16:03.200
- I THOUGHT THAT WE HAD
A RELATIONSHIP...

16:03.233 --> 16:05.734
- ARE YOU GUYS WATCHING THE FEED
FROM THE BABY MONITOR?

16:05.767 --> 16:07.433
- IT WAS SANGAR'S IDEA!

16:07.467 --> 16:09.367
- THANKS FOR NOTHING,
GWENDOLYN.

16:09.400 --> 16:11.000
- OH, HUSH,
IT'S JUST GETTING GOOD!

16:11.033 --> 16:12.467
- GUYS, THIS IS SO NOT RIGHT.

16:12.500 --> 16:13.734
- BABE, JUST--PLEASE,
JUST TALK TO ME.

16:13.767 --> 16:15.500
- I THOUGHT WE HAD
A RELATIONSHIP BUILT ON TRUST!

16:15.533 --> 16:19.567
- OKAY, SQUEEZE OVER.
JUST GOTTA GET IN HERE.

16:19.600 --> 16:21.667
- WE DO.
THIS DOESN'T CHANGE THAT.

16:21.700 --> 16:23.433
- YES, IT DOES, BECAUSE WHAT
ELSE HAVEN'T YOU TOLD ME?

16:23.467 --> 16:25.333
- NOTHING!
I TELL YOU EVERYTHING!

16:25.367 --> 16:27.000
IT WAS, LIKE,
A MILLION YEARS AGO.

16:27.033 --> 16:28.500
AND I MARRIED YOU!

16:28.533 --> 16:30.767
- BECAUSE YOU COULDN'T GET WHAT
YOU ACTUALLY WANTED!

16:31.000 --> 16:32.233
I MEAN, I'M LIKE
THE NASTY PANTIES

16:32.266 --> 16:34.066
IN THE BARGAIN BIN
AT LOEHMANN'S!

16:34.100 --> 16:35.500
- YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU KNOW WHY I DIDN'T TELL YOU?

16:35.533 --> 16:36.734
I DIDN'T TELL YOU BECAUSE
I KNEW YOU WOULDN'T REACT

16:37.000 --> 16:39.166
LIKE A NORMAL PERSON.
- WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

16:39.200 --> 16:40.433
- IF I FOLD A BATH TOWEL WRONG,
YOU GO RUNNING OFF

16:40.467 --> 16:41.567
TO YOUR HOARDER'S CLOSET.

16:41.600 --> 16:44.033

- TINA, I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT
YOU DON'T HAVE TO FEEL

16:50.734 --> 16:52.300
THREATENED BY ME.

16:52.333 --> 16:54.300
- OH, I'M NOT THREATENED BY YOU,
OKAY?

16:54.333 --> 16:56.100
I MEAN, LOOK AT YOU.
YOU'RE A DISASTER.

16:56.133 --> 16:57.467
- OKAY, THAT'S A LITTLE HURTFUL.

16:57.500 --> 16:59.233
- I KNOW THIS IS REALLY HARD
FOR YOU TO UNDERSTAND

16:59.266 --> 17:02.333
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, EVERYTHING
IS ALWAYS ALL ABOUT EMMA.

17:02.367 --> 17:06.000
BUT THIS HAS ABSOLUTELY
NOTHING TO DO WITH YOU!

17:06.033 --> 17:07.300
- OKAY, I THINK IT HAS
SOMETHING TO DO WITH ME.

17:07.333 --> 17:08.467
I MEAN, TWO MINUTES AGO, HE SAID

17:08.500 --> 17:10.133
HE WOULD HAVE GONE TO CHINA
WITH ME, BUT--

17:10.166 --> 17:14.533
- WHY WOULD YOU SAY THAT,
OUT LOUD, IN THE WORLD?

17:14.567 --> 17:17.433
- OKAY, WE'RE CLOSING IT DOWN
AND WE'RE SHUTTING IT UP, OKAY?

17:17.467 --> 17:20.467
I GOTTA GET UP THERE.
EXCUSE ME.

17:25.433 --> 17:27.734
- WHAT DOES IT MATTER?
IT WAS NEVER GONNA WORK OUT.

17:27.767 --> 17:30.033
I MEAN, DO YOU REALLY SEE ME
MARRIED TO "MONSTER MASH"?

17:30.066 --> 17:32.500
- WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT!
WHO IS "MONSTER MASH?"

17:32.533 --> 17:33.700
- OH, NO.

17:33.734 --> 17:37.467
- NO, NO, NO, MAGGIE,

17:37.500 --> 17:40.033
SOMEONE TELL ME
WHO "MONSTER MASH" IS,

17:40.066 --> 17:41.600
AND DO NOT SAY IT'S ME.

17:41.633 --> 17:43.200
- IT'S YOU.
- TINA--

17:43.233 --> 17:44.633
- THAT'S YOUR NICKNAME.

17:44.667 --> 17:46.367
THAT'S WHAT WE CALLED YOU BEHIND
YOUR BACK IN HIGH SCHOOL.

17:46.400 --> 17:50.300
- WHAT?
IS THAT TRUE?

17:50.333 --> 17:53.367
- OKAY, WELL, YOU KNOW HOW
PEOPLE CALLED ME "STRING BEAN",

17:53.400 --> 17:55.333
AND TINA "BIRD BONES"?

17:55.367 --> 17:58.467
WELL...THEY CALLED YOU
"MONSTER MASH".

17:58.500 --> 18:00.333
- WHAT? WHY?

18:00.367 --> 18:01.600
BECAUSE I'M
AN EMOTIONAL MONSTER,

18:01.633 --> 18:04.266
OR 'CAUSE I MASH
PEOPLE'S FEELINGS?

18:04.300 --> 18:06.266
- NO, 'CAUSE OF THAT TAP-DANCE
THAT YOU DID

18:06.300 --> 18:09.100
AT THE EIGHTH-GRADE TALENT SHOW,

A GRAVEYARD SMASH ♪

18:16.667 --> 18:19.266
- IT WASN'T A SMASH.

18:19.300 --> 18:20.700
- BUT I WAS WEARING
THAT WEREWOLF MASK,

18:20.734 --> 18:23.066
AND MY DAD'S LAB COAT.

18:23.100 --> 18:25.100
I GOT A STANDING OVATION
FOR THAT.

18:25.133 --> 18:27.734
- FROM YOUR DAD.

18:34.000 --> 18:36.734
HOW FUNNY

18:36.767 --> 18:38.600
- FUNNY?
- DO YOU SEE ME LAUGHING?

18:38.633 --> 18:40.166

IT'S FUNNY AT ALL!

18:40.200 --> 18:42.333

19:22.233 --> 19:24.200
NOTHING HAPPENED!
- IT WAS NO BIGGIE.

19:24.233 --> 19:25.667
- THIS IS A HUGE BIGGIE,
JUST FYI!

19:25.700 --> 19:28.133
- I'M SORRY,
WHY EXACTLY IS THAT

19:28.166 --> 19:29.533
