WEBVTT

00:07.050 --> 00:09.183
<i>Previously</i> <i>
on</i> Star Trek: Discovery...

00:09.226 --> 00:11.794
All those in favor
of peaceful efforts

00:11.837 --> 00:15.058
at first contact,
please raise a hand.

00:15.102 --> 00:18.105
Those in favor of striking
the anomaly, do not.

00:18.148 --> 00:19.410
Why do you care
so much about this?

00:19.454 --> 00:22.152
The power source
that controls the device,

00:22.196 --> 00:24.546
I need it to go home.

00:24.589 --> 00:27.723
We have received word
that the DMA is now days away

00:27.766 --> 00:30.073
from Ni'Var, Titan and Earth.

00:30.117 --> 00:33.381
- What happens now?
- We're fast-tracking the first contact mission.

00:33.424 --> 00:37.037
Whatever we think we know about
Species Ten-C, we're wrong.

00:37.080 --> 00:40.040
<i>However we think first contact</i> <i>
will go, it won't.</i>

00:40.083 --> 00:41.780
So that's the hyperfield.

00:41.824 --> 00:44.914
There is a planet about
two light-years away from it.

00:44.957 --> 00:47.656
I really think we should
check it out once we get closer.

00:47.699 --> 00:49.397
What do you think we'll find?

00:49.440 --> 00:51.529
I have no idea.

00:53.140 --> 00:57.970
<i>
Captain's log,</i> <i>
stardate 865783.7.</i>

00:58.014 --> 01:01.931
<i>We have less than 29 hours
before United Earth and Ni'Var</i>

01:01.974 --> 01:05.543
<i>start getting hit</i> <i>
by debris from the DMA.</i>

01:05.587 --> 01:09.199
<i>29 hours, billions of lives.</i>

01:10.374 --> 01:13.334
<i>Until I figure out how to get us</i> <i>
in front of the Ten-C,</i>

01:13.377 --> 01:16.119
<i>there is nothing we can do</i> <i>
to stop this.</i>

01:16.163 --> 01:18.121
<i>They live inside</i> <i>
of a hyperfield,</i>

01:18.165 --> 01:20.776
<i>and right now I have no idea</i> <i>
how to get in,</i>

01:20.819 --> 01:24.606
<i>what we'll find once we do,</i> <i>
how to communicate with them,</i>

01:24.649 --> 01:26.521
<i>what they even look like.</i>

01:26.564 --> 01:29.741
<i>As a xenoanthropologist, I've</i> <i>
never had less to work with.</i>

01:29.785 --> 01:34.616
<i>And as a captain,
I have never been more afraid.</i>

01:34.659 --> 01:38.620
<i>Our only hope is the dead
planet we're orbiting right now.</i>

01:38.663 --> 01:42.493
<i>It was a gas giant until a
series of massive asteroids hit</i>

01:42.537 --> 01:43.973
<i>and burned the gas away.</i>

01:44.016 --> 01:46.280
<i>Its star is surrounded</i> <i>
by Dyson rings</i>

01:46.323 --> 01:49.413
<i>made from the same rare material</i> <i>
as the DMA controller,</i>

01:49.457 --> 01:51.720
<i>and my gut tells me</i> <i>
there has to be a connection.</i>

01:51.763 --> 01:55.289
<i>That this planet must have been
the Ten-C's home at some point.</i>

01:55.332 --> 01:58.248
<i>And the ruins down there can</i> <i>
tell us how they lived,</i>

01:58.292 --> 02:00.163
<i>what's important to them.</i>

02:00.207 --> 02:05.125
<i>Cultural context,</i> <i>
a way to begin communicating.</i>

02:05.168 --> 02:07.127
<i>If I'm wrong, we'll have no way</i>

02:07.170 --> 02:10.130
<i>to make up the time</i> <i>
we spend down there.</i>

02:10.173 --> 02:13.698
<i>And the DMA will be
that much closer to our homes.</i>

02:13.742 --> 02:16.484
Hey, um, fly good.

02:16.527 --> 02:18.181
You got it.

02:20.618 --> 02:23.534
But if I'm right, and something
we find can help us

02:23.578 --> 02:26.537
<i>connect with the Ten-C,</i> <i>
then maybe we have a shot</i>

02:26.581 --> 02:28.844
<i>at stopping this</i> <i>
before it's too late.</i>

02:28.887 --> 02:31.325
<i>I have to be right.</i>

02:31.368 --> 02:33.240
<i>I have to.</i>

02:36.330 --> 02:38.027
Scan it again.

02:38.070 --> 02:40.638
- There has to be a way in.
- A new scan won't tell us

02:40.682 --> 02:42.336
anything the last dozen hasn't.

02:42.379 --> 02:44.860
Any chance the DMA could be
powered from somewhere else?

02:44.903 --> 02:46.470
No.

02:47.776 --> 02:51.867
We get in, we find the power
source, we shut it down.

02:51.910 --> 02:53.651
Everybody wins.

02:53.695 --> 02:56.350
We just need to get in.

02:56.393 --> 02:58.221
If I know Michael,
she'll find a way

02:58.265 --> 03:00.092
into the hyperfield
before we do.

03:00.136 --> 03:03.879
Kick me while I'm down,
why don't you?

03:04.706 --> 03:06.490
Maybe if we stay cloaked

03:06.534 --> 03:08.492
and keep close to <i>Discovery,</i>
we can slip in behind them.

03:08.536 --> 03:13.628
I'll go one better:
we hitch a ride with <i>Discovery.</i>

03:13.671 --> 03:17.327
There's an animal on Kwejian...

03:17.371 --> 03:19.242
Uh, was an animal.

03:20.156 --> 03:22.202
- The Kowolian nightsprey.
- Mm-hmm.

03:22.245 --> 03:24.552
To survive, it nested
on the back of a jajtspat.

03:24.595 --> 03:27.076
So we attach like a parasite.
Yeah, that's a good idea.

03:27.119 --> 03:28.556
No. Not like a parasite.

03:28.599 --> 03:32.168
The nightsprey takes nothing,
brings no harm.

03:32.212 --> 03:34.214
The jajtspat
can't even tell it's there.

03:34.257 --> 03:36.999
It's a tonal difference,
I get it, but still,

03:37.042 --> 03:39.262
it's probably safe
to assume the jajtspat

03:39.306 --> 03:41.264
didn't have
a sentient supercomputer

03:41.308 --> 03:43.266
monitoring
all of its perimeters.

03:43.310 --> 03:45.573
- You don't seem worried.
- Oh, there's nothing I love

03:45.616 --> 03:48.053
more than a problem to solve.

03:49.272 --> 03:50.621
Okay.

03:50.665 --> 03:52.275
I can create a patch.

03:53.929 --> 03:55.670
It'll numb the sensors
on a section

03:55.713 --> 03:58.542
of <i>Discovery's</i> hull, just big
enough to attach your ship

03:58.586 --> 04:01.241
- without Zora realizing it.
- Like a blind spot.

04:01.284 --> 04:04.418
Well, with Zora's new sentience,
she'll pick up on it eventually,

04:04.461 --> 04:07.290
but with any luck, we'll have
nightspreyed ourselves

04:07.334 --> 04:09.031
into the hyperfield
before that happens.

04:09.074 --> 04:11.425
- There's just one catch.
- I don't like the sound of that.

04:11.468 --> 04:13.949
Well, you're not gonna
like this, either.

04:13.992 --> 04:16.343
Patch has to be
installed manually.

04:16.386 --> 04:18.388
You want to go on board?

04:18.432 --> 04:20.303
No, in fact, that's
the last thing I want to do.

04:20.347 --> 04:22.610
But the access point I need
is in Engineering.

04:22.653 --> 04:24.089
I'm going with you.

04:24.133 --> 04:26.135
I can move faster on my own.

04:26.178 --> 04:27.876
You don't know the ship
half as well as I do.

04:27.919 --> 04:29.312
And what if you see Michael?

04:29.356 --> 04:33.447
One wrong move,
and it's over for both of us.

04:33.490 --> 04:36.450
We're doing this together, okay?

04:36.493 --> 04:38.278
End of story.

04:48.723 --> 04:50.290
Captain.

04:54.511 --> 04:56.644
When we agreed
to survey the planet,

04:56.687 --> 04:59.342
I didn't expect <i>Discovery</i>
would be losing her captain

04:59.386 --> 05:01.170
and her first officer.

05:01.213 --> 05:04.347
Nilsson has the conn;
you are in excellent hands.

05:04.391 --> 05:05.653
I'm sure we are.

05:05.696 --> 05:07.698
And while a xenoanthropologist

05:07.742 --> 05:11.049
is understandably the best
choice to lead this mission,

05:11.093 --> 05:15.358
is Captain Saru's presence
truly necessary?

05:16.316 --> 05:18.883
Mr. Saru can speak
over a hundred languages

05:18.927 --> 05:22.017
and his sensory capabilities
dwarf ours.

05:22.060 --> 05:25.150
He might see something
that I can't.

05:25.194 --> 05:26.630
And every minute
that we spend on that planet,

05:26.674 --> 05:29.894
the DMA is that much closer
to killing billions.

05:31.069 --> 05:34.116
I have to make that time count.

05:34.899 --> 05:36.379
Understood.

05:38.076 --> 05:39.687
What about the others?

05:39.730 --> 05:40.949
Do they understand?

05:40.992 --> 05:43.430
As you said,
a lot at stake here.

05:44.605 --> 05:45.910
Madam President,

05:45.954 --> 05:48.260
General, Doctor.

05:48.304 --> 05:50.959
I appreciate you seeing us off. Captain.

05:51.002 --> 05:53.004
I cannot express
a greater need for urgency

05:53.048 --> 05:54.876
than you must already feel.

05:55.920 --> 05:58.706
Please, all of you,
travel safely.

05:58.749 --> 06:01.317
May you find answers,
in whatever form they take,

06:01.361 --> 06:02.797
and quickly.

06:02.840 --> 06:04.929
In other words,
make the trip count;

06:04.973 --> 06:07.279
don't screw it up.

06:11.806 --> 06:13.155
Captain Burnham,

06:13.198 --> 06:15.418
I must voice my dismay
at this decision.

06:15.462 --> 06:19.814
We left delegates behind
because time is of the essence.

06:19.857 --> 06:22.338
On behalf of the citizens
of United Earth,

06:22.382 --> 06:25.689
whose lives are in danger
in this very moment,

06:25.733 --> 06:28.692
I ask that you reconsider,
so that we might better commit

06:28.736 --> 06:30.607
the precious time
that they have left

06:30.651 --> 06:34.437
to actually attempting
to communicate with the Ten-C.

06:34.481 --> 06:35.786
We have much to convey,

06:35.830 --> 06:38.441
and no idea how long
it will take to do so.

06:38.485 --> 06:40.356
I hear you, General.

06:40.400 --> 06:42.402
I do.

06:42.445 --> 06:45.492
Both Earth and Ni'Var

06:45.535 --> 06:47.102
are home to me.

06:47.145 --> 06:50.192
Whatever we might find
down on that planet,

06:50.235 --> 06:52.716
it could cut
our communication time in half.

06:52.760 --> 06:56.285
"Might." "Could."

06:56.328 --> 06:59.114
This is quite the gamble
for so much uncertainty.

06:59.157 --> 07:03.292
I am certain that first contact
will not go well

07:03.335 --> 07:07.383
if we show up to the Ten-C
knowing nothing about them.

07:10.342 --> 07:13.345
I will find something
down there.

07:15.304 --> 07:17.001
I promise.

07:27.229 --> 07:28.535
We ready?

07:28.578 --> 07:30.101
- Aye, Captain.
- Aye, Captain.

07:39.937 --> 07:41.983
Captain Burnham?

07:43.201 --> 07:44.942
Good luck.

09:32.920 --> 09:35.183
Disco Zero Nine to <i>Discovery,</i>

09:35.226 --> 09:37.315
we're about
to enter the ionosphere.

09:37.359 --> 09:39.622
Losing comms from there.

09:39.666 --> 09:41.319
<i>
Understood, Commander.</i>

09:41.363 --> 09:43.931
<i>Good luck. Hope you find</i> <i>
what you're looking for.</i>

09:45.410 --> 09:46.890
Protective shielding deployed.

09:46.934 --> 09:48.588
It's good to know
that the laws of physics

09:48.631 --> 09:50.720
still apply outside of
our galaxy.

09:50.764 --> 09:53.549
Hang on. Ride'll smooth out
in a minute.

09:53.593 --> 09:56.204
Scans show
numerous impact craters,

09:56.247 --> 09:58.554
presumably caused
by the asteroids.

09:58.598 --> 10:01.905
Uh, based on the rate
of atmospheric dissipation,

10:01.949 --> 10:04.865
these would have occurred
approximately 1,000 years ago.

10:04.908 --> 10:07.998
Around the time the hyperfield
itself was constructed.

10:08.042 --> 10:10.479
Well, that makes sense.
Given how advanced they are,

10:10.522 --> 10:12.394
the Ten-C would've had some idea

10:12.437 --> 10:14.222
of what was coming
and evacuated beforehand.

10:14.265 --> 10:15.702
Take a look at these ruins.

10:15.745 --> 10:17.704
The way
the buildings have collapsed.

10:17.747 --> 10:19.401
I cannot think of any materials

10:19.444 --> 10:21.229
that could withstand
the extreme pressures

10:21.272 --> 10:24.058
at the core of a gas giant.
It seems rather impossible

10:24.101 --> 10:26.582
for biological entities,
as well.

10:26.626 --> 10:28.584
The Ten-C must've lived
in the gas layers.

10:28.628 --> 10:30.238
But how?

10:30.281 --> 10:32.849
They must be unlike any species
we've ever encountered.

10:32.893 --> 10:34.503
Well, there has to be
something down there

10:34.546 --> 10:36.026
to help us
communicate with them.

10:36.070 --> 10:38.594
Oh, one structure looks
like it's still intact.

10:38.638 --> 10:40.857
Perhaps it was reinforced
in some way?

10:40.901 --> 10:43.817
- But why?
- We're about to find out.

11:06.448 --> 11:08.406
Any life signs?

11:08.450 --> 11:10.017
None whatsoever.

11:10.060 --> 11:11.801
One less thing to worry about.

11:11.845 --> 11:14.935
Oh, well, apologies.
I-I should have clarified.

11:14.978 --> 11:19.635
I do not read any life signs,
including ours.

11:19.679 --> 11:23.030
So we might not be alone.

11:23.073 --> 11:25.380
Make sure they're set to stun.

11:57.194 --> 11:58.805
We're under attack! Take cover!

11:58.848 --> 12:00.371
Oh.

12:09.250 --> 12:10.860
Mr. Saru. It's okay.

12:10.904 --> 12:12.862
Breathe.

12:19.434 --> 12:21.392
Are you all right?

12:21.436 --> 12:23.873
I... I am fine. Just, uh...

12:23.917 --> 12:25.788
disoriented.

12:25.832 --> 12:29.400
- Are you sure?
- I said I am fine, Commander.

12:31.315 --> 12:34.405
It must have been vertigo,

12:34.449 --> 12:38.366
a... a glint of light
coming off of that.

12:41.238 --> 12:42.805
What is that?

12:42.849 --> 12:44.981
If I'm not mistaken,
we're looking at the cusp

12:45.025 --> 12:47.767
of an extremely large bone.

12:49.420 --> 12:51.161
<i>
Scans show their shuttle went</i>

12:51.205 --> 12:52.380
<i>all the way down</i> <i>
to the surface.</i>

12:52.423 --> 12:54.164
<i>Discovery's</i> not going anywhere

12:54.208 --> 12:56.210
while part of their crew's gone,

12:56.253 --> 12:58.908
but who knows
how much time that buys us.

13:00.475 --> 13:04.784
These'll camouflage our biosigns
from Zora's sensors.

13:08.222 --> 13:09.963
Listen,
if you're not all-in on this,

13:10.006 --> 13:11.921
you need to level with me
right now.

13:11.965 --> 13:15.142
Because if you lose focus, and
we're still on board <i>Discovery</i>

13:15.185 --> 13:16.839
when that shuttle gets back...

13:16.883 --> 13:19.668
These people--

13:19.711 --> 13:22.497
they've become family to me.

13:22.540 --> 13:24.499
Your conscience,

13:24.542 --> 13:28.503
versus the billions of lives
that are at stake.

13:28.546 --> 13:30.766
You can't have everything.

13:31.941 --> 13:35.031
I know it's complicated,
especially with Michael,

13:35.075 --> 13:37.164
but the lives we're trying
to save include hers,

13:37.207 --> 13:41.777
and everyone else over there,
whether or not they realize it.

13:57.662 --> 14:00.578
- Is that a Kwejian thing?
- No.

14:00.622 --> 14:02.798
I just like having a torso.

14:08.064 --> 14:09.196
On my mark.

14:09.239 --> 14:11.328
Three, two...

14:12.939 --> 14:15.028
- Aah!
- Shh. Hey.

14:15.071 --> 14:17.117
A little more clarity next time.

14:17.160 --> 14:19.380
Seriously?

14:27.910 --> 14:29.869
Engineering's this way.

14:30.957 --> 14:32.741
Let's stay alert.

14:32.784 --> 14:34.482
Dr. Culber,
what are your scans telling you?

14:34.525 --> 14:36.397
Well, it looks like

14:36.440 --> 14:38.747
the bone structure is of
unusually low density.

14:38.790 --> 14:41.532
Before it was fossilized,
it would've been flexible,

14:41.576 --> 14:43.795
almost like cartilage.

14:45.710 --> 14:49.062
Their physiology
was perfectly adapted

14:49.105 --> 14:50.890
for floating in gas layers.

14:50.933 --> 14:53.370
What do you think
all the blue dust is?

14:53.414 --> 14:58.898
It's not soil. It's some kind
of complex hydrocarbon compound.

14:58.941 --> 15:00.943
No idea what, though.
It's...

15:00.987 --> 15:03.467
It's not
in Federation databases.

15:03.511 --> 15:05.513
Check this out.

15:10.866 --> 15:12.650
A mass grave?

15:12.694 --> 15:15.131
The way
they're all gathered, it's...

15:15.175 --> 15:17.829
like they were
bracing themselves.

15:17.873 --> 15:19.744
Scans date these bones
to the same time

15:19.788 --> 15:21.050
as the fragment strikes.

15:21.094 --> 15:23.487
So they didn't all escape.

15:23.531 --> 15:24.619
Even with all their tech.

15:24.662 --> 15:27.274
A full-planet evacuation
was impossible.

15:28.623 --> 15:30.886
It would be for anyone.

15:34.194 --> 15:35.630
We need to get
into that building,

15:35.673 --> 15:36.848
figure out who they are

15:36.892 --> 15:39.112
and how to talk to them.
Let's go.

15:47.555 --> 15:49.513
- Saru?
- Hmm?

15:49.557 --> 15:51.689
What's going on for you?

15:51.733 --> 15:53.778
I apologize, Captain.

15:53.822 --> 15:55.911
I seem to be feeling things

15:55.955 --> 15:58.000
I have not felt
for quite some time.

15:58.044 --> 16:00.394
What are you feeling?

16:00.611 --> 16:03.745
The coming... of death.

16:19.108 --> 16:21.850
Ah, a puzzle.

16:21.893 --> 16:24.070
Altonian?

16:24.113 --> 16:26.072
Ancient Earth.

16:26.115 --> 16:28.770
Dr. Kovich introduced me to it.

16:28.813 --> 16:30.380
Oh.

16:30.424 --> 16:35.081
I need "an act which a person
is bound to complete."

16:35.124 --> 16:36.604
"Mission."

16:36.647 --> 16:40.086
Exactly what I'd like
to discuss, in fact.

16:40.129 --> 16:42.088
"Mission" is seven letters.

16:42.131 --> 16:44.003
This is ten. Fifth letter: "G."

16:44.046 --> 16:47.615
We need to talk
about your bedside manner.

16:47.658 --> 16:50.574
The bluntness with which
you spoke to the captain today

16:50.618 --> 16:52.837
was not entirely appropriate.

16:52.881 --> 16:55.492
And you saw how
it affected General Ndoye.

16:56.493 --> 17:01.063
I am doing everything
in my power

17:01.107 --> 17:03.935
to contain the delegates'
stress and panic.

17:03.979 --> 17:06.373
I need you to help me.

17:06.416 --> 17:08.679
Whether they worry
about tomorrow or not,

17:08.723 --> 17:10.768
it'll arrive all the same.

17:10.812 --> 17:13.075
I'm not sure how we can help

17:13.119 --> 17:15.077
with their lack
of perspective on that.

17:15.121 --> 17:20.300
While I admire your commitment
to the long view,

17:20.343 --> 17:24.434
my concern is for those
who are struggling right now.

17:24.478 --> 17:28.699
They need to feel supported
in order to do their best work.

17:30.005 --> 17:33.139
So, moving forward,

17:33.182 --> 17:37.621
I would like you
to exercise a bit more tact,

17:37.665 --> 17:39.710
starting upon our return

17:39.754 --> 17:42.844
to first contact planning
in ten minutes.

17:49.807 --> 17:51.635
Okay, we're at the mess hall.

17:51.679 --> 17:54.377
If it's empty, we could
drop down and take a shortcut.

18:04.387 --> 18:07.303
- It was worth a shot. Come on.
- Wait.

18:07.347 --> 18:09.436
<i>
If I were home,</i> <i>
at least I could be helping</i>

18:09.479 --> 18:12.091
<i>with evacuations</i> <i>
or mounting a defense.</i>

18:12.134 --> 18:13.962
We still have time, General.

18:14.005 --> 18:15.485
Captain Burnham's mission...

18:15.529 --> 18:17.139
Is a waste of that time.

18:17.183 --> 18:20.316
The DMA could destroy both
of our worlds within days.

18:20.360 --> 18:22.101
How can you be so calm?

18:22.144 --> 18:25.321
Ni'Var's emergency protocols
are well defined.

18:25.365 --> 18:27.845
I trust my vice president
is doing everything

18:27.889 --> 18:29.108
according to our plans.

18:29.151 --> 18:31.632
The math doesn't lie.
There are too many.

18:31.675 --> 18:33.764
Most will not be saved.

18:33.808 --> 18:37.855
We are here
to prevent such catastrophe.

18:37.899 --> 18:40.771
This is where
we can best serve our people.

18:40.815 --> 18:44.035
If we act. We could be meeting
with the Ten-C even now,

18:44.079 --> 18:46.647
<i>demanding they turn off</i> <i>
their bloody device.</i>

18:46.690 --> 18:49.563
<i>
We cannot communicate
if we know nothing about them.</i>

18:49.606 --> 18:52.609
Opportunities multiply
as they are seized.

18:53.958 --> 18:56.178
We should have gone directly
into the hyperfield.

19:01.140 --> 19:03.403
That was tense.

19:05.187 --> 19:07.407
Let's go.

19:48.926 --> 19:51.015
I thought his extreme
fear response was lost

19:51.059 --> 19:53.366
- after <i>Vahar'ai.</i>
- So did I.

19:53.409 --> 19:54.976
But his cortisol
and adrenaline levels

19:55.019 --> 19:56.543
are dangerously elevated.

19:56.586 --> 19:58.240
See if you can stabilize him.

19:58.284 --> 20:00.634
- I'll continue with Detmer.
- Yes, Captain.

20:00.677 --> 20:02.244
Mr. Saru?

20:04.028 --> 20:06.422
Come on.
Let's get you checked out.

20:28.009 --> 20:30.577
What do you think this was?

20:30.620 --> 20:32.056
Meeting space,

20:32.100 --> 20:34.755
worship area,

20:34.798 --> 20:36.670
maybe an arena.

20:36.713 --> 20:38.889
Community structures are common
in a large variety of cultures.

20:38.933 --> 20:42.458
Maybe we'll find something
that'll tell us.

20:42.502 --> 20:44.460
We're looking
for technology, artifacts,

20:44.504 --> 20:46.854
anything that can provide
cultural context.

20:46.897 --> 20:49.248
Got it.

20:52.163 --> 20:54.209
Easy there.

20:54.253 --> 20:56.298
Something is wrong here.

20:56.342 --> 20:59.867
Something is causing me
to feel this.

20:59.910 --> 21:01.651
I don't think so.

21:01.695 --> 21:05.220
Our EV suits protect us
from any external elements.

21:05.264 --> 21:06.482
Here.

21:15.796 --> 21:17.537
Do you understand now?

21:18.929 --> 21:21.236
I do.

21:27.242 --> 21:30.027
Deck's empty. We're okay.

21:30.071 --> 21:32.465
Okay.
We're right below Engineering.

21:32.508 --> 21:35.424
Three biosigns.

21:35.468 --> 21:38.035
We have to create a diversion
to pull them away long enough

21:38.079 --> 21:39.428
for me to install the patch.

21:39.472 --> 21:42.388
Once your ship is invisible
to Zora...

21:42.431 --> 21:44.520
What? You're looking at me
like you have something to say.

21:44.564 --> 21:46.696
I have an idea
for a slight change of plans.

21:46.740 --> 21:49.699
- How slight?
- I want to ask General Ndoye to help us.

21:49.743 --> 21:52.876
Well, that sounds like a great
idea. They put us in the brig.

21:52.920 --> 21:54.356
And I'd prefer
not spend any more years

21:54.400 --> 21:56.358
- under someone else's thumb.
- I know it's a risk.

21:56.402 --> 21:58.839
But if she could give us intel
about <i>Discovery's</i> plans,

21:58.882 --> 22:02.146
we could get right in front
of any issues, adapt.

22:02.190 --> 22:04.366
She voted in support
of our plans at the assembly,

22:04.410 --> 22:06.237
and you heard
what she just said.

22:06.281 --> 22:07.804
She needs this
as much as we do.

22:07.848 --> 22:09.415
Her planet's
running out of time.

22:09.458 --> 22:12.896
I think that she'll see
the best way to stop the DMA

22:12.940 --> 22:15.072
and save lives is
to take control of this.

22:15.116 --> 22:17.031
The shuttle could be back
any minute.

22:17.074 --> 22:18.337
I'll talk fast.

22:20.382 --> 22:23.080
I put in the patch,
you track down Ndoye.

22:23.124 --> 22:24.691
See you back on my ship.

22:24.734 --> 22:26.736
Hey, Book?

22:26.780 --> 22:28.347
Be convincing.

22:52.022 --> 22:53.720
Room's empty, Captain.

22:53.763 --> 22:56.113
No cultural relics.

22:56.157 --> 22:58.159
Nothing on the walls.

22:59.595 --> 23:01.118
I...

23:01.162 --> 23:03.686
Do you want me to take Mr. Saru
back to the shuttle?

23:03.730 --> 23:05.949
I've never seen him like this.

23:05.993 --> 23:07.995
No. Let's see
if Culber can help him.

23:08.038 --> 23:09.910
We don't have any data yet.

23:09.953 --> 23:11.955
I have
to make this mission count.

23:11.999 --> 23:14.958
It's not all on you, Captain.

23:15.002 --> 23:18.309
We're all here to help.

23:22.705 --> 23:25.012
- Captain?
- No.

23:25.055 --> 23:26.230
Stand back.

23:29.364 --> 23:31.497
Stay back!

23:31.540 --> 23:32.846
Captain?

23:32.889 --> 23:34.978
Your biometrics
are elevating rapidly.

23:35.022 --> 23:37.894
- Something's wrong.
- Hallucinations?

23:39.287 --> 23:41.637
What's happening
to Saru is happening to me.

23:41.681 --> 23:43.770
And now, you.
Shadows, lights?

23:43.813 --> 23:45.554
Screaming.
Our fear responses

23:45.598 --> 23:48.339
are being triggered
to an exceptional degree.

23:49.297 --> 23:51.299
Except Commander Detmer.

23:51.342 --> 23:53.823
Her biosigns
haven't changed at all.

23:53.867 --> 23:56.086
- Yet.
- How is it

23:56.130 --> 23:58.088
that we're experiencing
the same visions?

23:58.132 --> 24:00.003
Something must be affecting
our minds

24:00.047 --> 24:03.485
and causing
these physiological responses.

24:06.662 --> 24:09.796
There's no evidence
of psionic energy or infrasound.

24:11.972 --> 24:14.322
Our suits filter out
environmental factors.

24:14.365 --> 24:17.499
No fluctuations in magnetic
or electrical fields, either.

24:17.543 --> 24:20.937
So whatever's doing this
is doing it some other way.

24:23.723 --> 24:25.376
Five minutes.

24:25.420 --> 24:29.424
We will retrace our steps
and figure out what's going on.

24:30.469 --> 24:33.036
Detmer, you stay back
and keep safe, okay?

24:33.080 --> 24:36.344
This mission comes first.

24:37.650 --> 24:40.174
If we're not able to fix this,
we're gonna need you to go back

24:40.217 --> 24:42.437
to the shuttle
and contact <i>Discovery.</i>

24:43.743 --> 24:46.572
Alone.

25:04.067 --> 25:06.026
<i>Triple-brewed raktajino.</i>

25:06.069 --> 25:08.507
Hot as hell, hold the nutmeg.

25:11.031 --> 25:13.120
<i>You want one?</i>

25:13.163 --> 25:13.903
Mm...

25:13.947 --> 25:15.339
Suit yourself.

25:15.383 --> 25:17.733
Those puppies saved me
on the <i>Hiawatha.</i>

25:17.777 --> 25:20.736
When you have to power through,
nothing beats the bitter elixir

25:20.780 --> 25:23.043
of Klingon warriors.

25:27.613 --> 25:30.137
Oh, that's my head.

25:30.180 --> 25:32.792
There must be something
pretty damn interesting in there

25:32.835 --> 25:34.924
to upstage Klingon warriors.

25:34.968 --> 25:38.449
I'm sorry.

25:38.493 --> 25:41.801
Um, just thinking
about Commander Detmer.

25:41.844 --> 25:44.194
Oh, I see.
When Gray's away...

25:44.238 --> 25:47.502
Okay, no, not like that. I...

25:47.546 --> 25:49.243
I just,

25:49.286 --> 25:53.552
uh, sometimes wish that I could
be a little bit more like her.

25:53.595 --> 25:55.597
Confident and, um,

25:55.641 --> 25:57.643
you know, able to go
on a mission without worrying

25:57.686 --> 26:00.559
about all of the ways
that I could screw it up.

26:00.602 --> 26:04.432
I think it's pretty safe
to assume that everyone,

26:04.475 --> 26:07.087
no matter what calm veneer
they present,

26:07.130 --> 26:09.263
is kind of a mess.

26:09.306 --> 26:12.309
I've just never seen her flinch.

26:12.353 --> 26:14.616
You know, she's always really
got it together.

26:14.660 --> 26:16.444
Ask her how she was

26:16.487 --> 26:19.534
after we flew out
of a wormhole and crashed.

26:21.014 --> 26:24.191
No one's always okay, kid.

26:24.234 --> 26:26.628
It takes a hell of a lot
of strength

26:26.672 --> 26:28.630
to admit when you're not.

26:28.674 --> 26:31.807
Which, I guess makes Detmer,

26:31.851 --> 26:34.244
in fact, the shit.

26:36.377 --> 26:39.336
If you admire her so much,
why don't you get to know her?

26:39.380 --> 26:41.295
Have you ever had
a conversation?

26:41.338 --> 26:44.298
Not, like,
just us in the same...

26:44.341 --> 26:45.821
I-I wouldn't really know

26:45.865 --> 26:47.518
how to... how to start that.

26:47.562 --> 26:49.825
Pro tip--

26:49.869 --> 26:52.001
don't start with
"I want to be you."

26:52.045 --> 26:53.829
It's kind of creepy.

26:55.657 --> 26:57.485
You'll figure it out.

27:13.936 --> 27:17.070
Well, Saru was touching my arm
right before it happened.

27:17.113 --> 27:21.378
But neither of us were
touching Captain Burnham

27:21.422 --> 27:22.989
when she became affected.

27:25.165 --> 27:28.472
And-and I was outside

27:28.516 --> 27:30.387
when the symptoms hit.

27:30.431 --> 27:32.476
And you and the captain
were inside.

27:36.350 --> 27:38.744
Could our suits be
malfunctioning?

27:39.658 --> 27:42.051
Detmer, are your settings
any different than ours?

27:42.095 --> 27:44.837
No. They're all the same.

27:44.880 --> 27:46.926
There's no reason
I should be fine.

27:46.969 --> 27:50.016
This doesn't make any sense.

27:51.060 --> 27:52.758
Is there any chance...

27:54.803 --> 27:57.937
...it could be the dust?

28:01.636 --> 28:06.597
There-there was a patch
of ground, unstable.

28:06.641 --> 28:09.078
I recall stepping through it

28:09.122 --> 28:11.080
just before
the hallucinations began.

28:11.124 --> 28:12.952
It was filled with dust.

28:12.995 --> 28:16.477
Yes, and I... I knelt in it
when I was treating you.

28:16.520 --> 28:19.262
And I touched it when I was
examining the trichome.

28:19.306 --> 28:21.264
And I haven't come
into direct contact with it.

28:21.308 --> 28:24.267
Okay.

28:24.311 --> 28:26.617
The hydrocarbons
that you analyzed earlier--

28:26.661 --> 28:29.751
they weren't found in any
of the Federation databases.

28:29.795 --> 28:32.580
So maybe our suits wouldn't
know how to block them.

28:32.623 --> 28:34.234
An unknown substance
could get through

28:34.277 --> 28:37.280
if its structure was
unusual enough.

28:42.764 --> 28:44.113
Here, let me recalibrate

28:44.157 --> 28:46.768
the programmable-matter
filtering system.

28:46.812 --> 28:48.770
There.

29:02.653 --> 29:05.091
So glad you were paying
attention in those EV trainings.

29:06.788 --> 29:08.877
Mr. Saru,

29:08.921 --> 29:11.793
your respiration
is still somewhat elevated.

29:11.837 --> 29:15.623
Oh, I'm all right, Doctor.

29:15.666 --> 29:17.799
It is just...

29:17.843 --> 29:21.281
I had forgot
the sensation of fear.

29:22.064 --> 29:25.198
Brings back... memories.

29:26.547 --> 29:28.549
It is nothing.
It'll... it'll pass.

29:29.985 --> 29:33.597
But I must say,
Commander Detmer,

29:33.641 --> 29:36.818
you remained remarkably calm as
we struggled with the unknown.

29:36.862 --> 29:39.255
PTSD therapy came in handy.

29:39.299 --> 29:41.344
Plus, the way I grew up.
I'm sort of

29:41.388 --> 29:43.869
the queen of putting things
in boxes.

29:45.653 --> 29:47.698
Take a look at this.

29:47.742 --> 29:49.962
Think I got something.

29:51.528 --> 29:54.096
Through the archway.
Look at that.

29:54.140 --> 29:57.099
It appears the Ten-C left
something behind after all.

29:58.622 --> 30:00.581
Let's go find out what.

30:04.977 --> 30:08.154
Shield upgrade means increasing

30:08.197 --> 30:10.156
nominal system output.
You get that, right?

30:10.199 --> 30:11.635
- Of course, Commander.
- Yes, Commander.

30:11.679 --> 30:14.856
Commander Reno,
I require some assistance.

30:14.900 --> 30:16.727
I live to serve.

30:16.771 --> 30:18.947
What do you need?

30:18.991 --> 30:22.037
The deck six tech-hub replicator
is malfunctioning.

30:22.081 --> 30:24.431
- What? I was just there.
- I'm receiving similar reports

30:24.474 --> 30:27.434
from decks two and three.
And just now,

30:27.477 --> 30:31.525
on deck five, it started
making steamed bananas.

30:31.568 --> 30:34.615
Okay, every word
of that is bad news.

30:34.658 --> 30:37.357
Get moving. If we lose
replicators out here,

30:37.400 --> 30:40.316
we starve to death.
No pressure.

31:04.819 --> 31:06.777
President T'Rina?

31:06.821 --> 31:08.779
You wished to speak further.

31:08.823 --> 31:11.913
Hello?

31:14.742 --> 31:16.962
President T'Rina?

31:20.530 --> 31:21.792
That message was from you?

31:21.836 --> 31:23.925
I need you to listen.

31:23.969 --> 31:25.971
How the hell are you even here?

31:26.014 --> 31:27.494
My ship is nearby, cloaked.

31:27.537 --> 31:29.017
And this is blocking
Zora's sensors for the moment,

31:29.061 --> 31:31.280
- but we don't have much time.
- Give me one reason

31:31.324 --> 31:33.152
why I shouldn't
call security right now.

31:33.195 --> 31:36.459
Because I'm here to help, but
to do that, I need your help.

31:36.503 --> 31:40.289
Two minutes.
That's all I ask.

31:47.340 --> 31:49.037
United Earth is now in the path

31:49.081 --> 31:51.692
of a more powerful DMA,
thanks to you.

31:51.735 --> 31:55.130
If we succeeded, you and your
home would be safe right now.

31:55.174 --> 31:56.958
Everyone would be.

31:57.002 --> 31:59.221
That was my goal then,
it's my goal now.

32:00.919 --> 32:02.659
You have one minute left.

32:02.703 --> 32:04.574
I've lost my home.

32:04.618 --> 32:06.359
You're about to lose yours.

32:06.402 --> 32:10.015
I know what it's like to feel
there's nothing you can do,

32:10.058 --> 32:12.582
when all you want
to do is take action.

32:12.626 --> 32:14.976
We can, General.

32:15.020 --> 32:18.197
We can end the DMA for good.

32:19.415 --> 32:22.375
If you have a plan,
I'll need every detail.

32:22.418 --> 32:25.030
Right now, one of <i>Discovery's</i>
shuttles is down on that planet.

32:25.073 --> 32:27.902
They're looking for something to
help with first contact, right?

32:27.946 --> 32:29.556
That was the intent.

32:29.599 --> 32:31.297
Is it Michael down there?

32:32.646 --> 32:34.169
She'll get what they need.

32:34.213 --> 32:35.997
Once she does,
my ship will enter

32:36.041 --> 32:38.043
into the hyperfield attached
to <i>Discovery.</i>

32:38.086 --> 32:40.784
Tarka will find the DMA's
power source and disable it.

32:40.828 --> 32:43.178
That'll stop the DMA.

32:43.222 --> 32:44.701
Earth will be safe.

32:44.745 --> 32:48.009
If you believe so firmly
in Captain Burnham's abilities,

32:48.053 --> 32:50.881
why not simply trust
that first contact will succeed?

32:50.925 --> 32:53.101
I have faith in Michael,
not the Ten-C.

32:53.145 --> 32:55.843
I can't let the lives
of billions of people hang

32:55.886 --> 32:57.976
on a hope that they'll be
sympathetic. Can you?

33:03.111 --> 33:05.722
How do I fit into all of this?

33:05.766 --> 33:07.246
Stay in contact. That's it.

33:07.289 --> 33:08.943
Tell us what she's planning

33:08.987 --> 33:10.727
so we can do what we need to do
without putting <i>Discovery</i>

33:10.771 --> 33:12.251
or anyone on it at risk.

33:12.294 --> 33:15.776
What you're asking already
involves significant risk.

33:15.819 --> 33:18.953
So I must insist
that it be a backup plan only.

33:18.997 --> 33:20.955
You need
to give diplomacy time to work.

33:20.999 --> 33:24.002
If the Ten-C capitulate before
United Earth is in the red zone,

33:24.045 --> 33:26.178
you and Mr. Tarka
must stand down.

33:26.221 --> 33:29.920
You have my word on that,
General. Do I have yours?

33:35.665 --> 33:37.798
It can't be coincidence

33:37.841 --> 33:39.626
that you all had
the same hallucinations.

33:39.669 --> 33:43.369
It's not. Somehow
the hydrocarbons let us see

33:43.412 --> 33:44.848
and hear what they did,

33:44.892 --> 33:46.981
what it was like
when their planet was destroyed.

33:47.025 --> 33:49.462
How is that even possible?

33:49.505 --> 33:50.985
I don't know yet.

33:51.029 --> 33:52.987
I may have something.

33:53.031 --> 33:53.901
Mr. Saru?

33:53.944 --> 33:55.903
Uh, this hydrocarbon

33:55.946 --> 33:57.122
is markedly different

33:57.165 --> 33:59.124
than the variety
we initially encountered.

33:59.167 --> 34:01.691
I fail to see why
that should be the case.

34:01.735 --> 34:04.477
Captain, over here.

34:05.304 --> 34:09.308
These pillars contain traces of
what I presume is their DNA--

34:09.351 --> 34:12.659
it matches the bones outside--
but based on the differences

34:12.702 --> 34:15.140
in methylation profiles,

34:15.183 --> 34:17.490
the DNA inside of here

34:17.533 --> 34:19.622
would have belonged to infants.

34:21.885 --> 34:24.801
This must be a cocoon
of some kind.

34:28.936 --> 34:30.677
This room was a nursery.

34:30.720 --> 34:32.766
That must be why
the structure was reinforced--

34:32.809 --> 34:35.334
to protect their young.

34:35.377 --> 34:40.295
Which means these beings
prioritize children.

34:40.339 --> 34:42.384
They value life.

34:42.428 --> 34:44.169
Cultural context.

34:44.212 --> 34:46.214
I wonder...

34:50.914 --> 34:53.134
Monitor my biosigns.

34:57.007 --> 34:58.313
What... what are you doing?

34:58.357 --> 35:00.881
I'm gonna let it in.

35:27.255 --> 35:28.909
It feels like love.

35:49.799 --> 35:51.932
It's peaceful.

35:52.715 --> 35:54.587
It feels...

35:54.630 --> 35:56.806
safe.

35:57.720 --> 36:01.333
I remember feeling this
with my parents.

36:03.987 --> 36:06.120
Commander,

36:06.164 --> 36:08.209
are you all right?

36:10.037 --> 36:12.953
Yeah, I've just never felt...

36:17.175 --> 36:19.177
My dad.

36:22.180 --> 36:24.617
He wasn't well.

36:24.660 --> 36:28.316
There was a disconnect
between him and reality.

36:28.360 --> 36:31.145
After my mom died,

36:31.189 --> 36:33.974
it was just
the two of us, so...

36:37.195 --> 36:38.979
Oh, Detmer.

36:40.981 --> 36:43.070
I, too,

36:43.113 --> 36:46.813
am a stranger
to some of these feelings.

36:46.856 --> 36:51.644
I do not believe I knew
an easy breath on Kaminar.

36:51.687 --> 36:55.300
I was ashamed

36:55.343 --> 36:58.172
when I felt afraid again today.

37:00.305 --> 37:02.307
But I was not alone.

37:03.525 --> 37:05.223
Neither are you.

37:08.182 --> 37:12.795
We're feeling love
and safety here in the nursery,

37:12.839 --> 37:14.841
but outside,
where so many of them died,

37:14.884 --> 37:18.758
we experienced panic and fear,
like they must have.

37:18.801 --> 37:20.760
I mean, Kelpien
and human biology

37:20.803 --> 37:22.501
are significantly different,

37:22.544 --> 37:26.026
but these hydrocarbons are
affecting us almost identically.

37:26.069 --> 37:28.594
Maybe some emotions
are universal.

37:28.637 --> 37:34.687
If true, that would connect us
all in quite a profound way.

37:34.730 --> 37:37.951
But I do not yet see
how we might make use

37:37.994 --> 37:40.562
of this for first contact.

37:40.606 --> 37:42.477
Neither do I.

37:42.521 --> 37:45.001
But there is something here.

37:46.394 --> 37:50.050
Let's reset our EV suit filters,

37:50.093 --> 37:51.704
finish scans
and get some samples.

37:51.747 --> 37:53.880
We can talk while we work.

37:53.923 --> 37:55.664
We've got to get back
to <i>Discovery.</i>

38:04.020 --> 38:05.674
Installing the patch now.

38:05.718 --> 38:07.763
Hull sensors will go numb
in five.

38:07.807 --> 38:09.504
What's your status with Ndoye?

38:09.548 --> 38:11.332
<i>
We're good.</i>

38:11.376 --> 38:13.682
<i>I'll fill you in</i> <i>
when we're back on board.</i>

38:13.726 --> 38:16.468
<i>LINUS</i> <i>
There must be some reason</i> <i>
for the malfunction.</i>

38:16.511 --> 38:19.166
Got to go.
It almost feels deliberate.

38:20.167 --> 38:22.691
What kind of idiot would
pull a practical joke

38:22.735 --> 38:24.693
in the middle
of an existential threat?

38:24.737 --> 38:26.304
<i>
I don't know.</i>

38:26.347 --> 38:28.741
Well, then, get off comms
and get me an answer.

38:28.784 --> 38:30.569
<i>Aye, Commander.</i>

38:34.268 --> 38:36.009
Who's here?

38:36.052 --> 38:41.275
If someone's screwing around,
today is not the day.

38:42.102 --> 38:46.236
Please tell me
I just spoiled a surprise party.

38:47.803 --> 38:49.544
Okay, we know

38:49.588 --> 38:52.025
the hydrocarbons
convey different emotions.

38:52.068 --> 38:54.941
But how? And why?

38:54.984 --> 38:58.466
Well, a number of chemicals
correspond to emotional states.

39:00.207 --> 39:03.253
Norepinephrine,
serotonin, dopamine.

39:03.297 --> 39:05.212
And there are also
numerous species

39:05.255 --> 39:08.868
whose means of expression
are entirely chemical.

39:08.911 --> 39:12.828
Uh, for instance,
the Plim of Asp 27 communicate

39:12.872 --> 39:15.440
by changing the scent
of their breath.

39:15.483 --> 39:17.398
Chemicals in the air.

39:17.442 --> 39:19.922
But you have
to be with someone.

39:19.966 --> 39:22.925
Is there a chemical
for not with someone?

39:22.969 --> 39:24.405
Like, when I was a kid,

39:24.449 --> 39:26.320
I didn't need to be
in the same room as my dad

39:26.364 --> 39:27.974
to know
that he was in a dark place.

39:28.017 --> 39:30.759
I could just... feel it.

39:30.803 --> 39:35.590
A lot of Earth species-- uh,
bees, wolves-- use pheromones.

39:35.634 --> 39:38.419
Which are often
hydrocarbon chains.

39:38.463 --> 39:41.857
Maybe these hydrocarbons are
the pheromones of the Ten-C.

39:41.901 --> 39:44.512
A way for them
to communicate with one another.

39:44.556 --> 39:47.428
Hmm.

39:47.472 --> 39:50.866
What if...

39:50.910 --> 39:55.175
this is our Rosetta stone?

39:55.218 --> 39:57.873
Are you are referring
to the ancient Earth artifact?

39:57.917 --> 40:00.876
It provided context
that was crucial

40:00.920 --> 40:02.443
to deciphering
Egyptian hieroglyphs.

40:02.487 --> 40:04.619
No one could understand them
before that.

40:04.663 --> 40:07.361
And you think these hydrocarbons
can do that for us?

40:07.405 --> 40:10.190
Help us find a way
to communicate with the Ten-C?

40:10.233 --> 40:13.411
Their emotions tell a story,
give us context.

40:13.454 --> 40:15.456
Well, we need more pieces
to the puzzle, but,

40:15.500 --> 40:18.720
yeah, I think
that's exactly what they can do.

40:21.201 --> 40:23.464
Nice work, all of you.

40:23.508 --> 40:25.335
This is what we came for.

40:25.379 --> 40:27.555
Let's get this back to the team.

40:51.405 --> 40:53.494
Disco Zero Nine to <i>Discovery,</i>

40:53.538 --> 40:55.975
we're back in comms range
and on our way home.

40:56.018 --> 40:57.455
<i>
Glad to hear it, Commander.</i>

40:57.498 --> 40:59.718
<i>See you all soon.</i>

41:04.070 --> 41:06.289
Captain?

41:07.682 --> 41:11.512
Back in the nursery, I...
I just want to apologize

41:11.556 --> 41:13.993
for letting my personal issues
compromise the...

41:14.036 --> 41:18.954
If you finish that sentence,
I will demote you to ensign.

41:19.738 --> 41:22.697
It's okay to not be in control
for five minutes.

41:24.569 --> 41:27.049
For as much as we would like

41:27.093 --> 41:30.183
to bury certain emotions,
perhaps it is...

41:30.226 --> 41:33.839
freeing to acknowledge
that we would not be who we are

41:33.882 --> 41:37.016
had we not experienced
all that we did.

41:37.059 --> 41:40.846
Maybe that's why the Ten-C
created the hyperfield--

41:40.889 --> 41:43.631
to protect themselves.

41:43.675 --> 41:45.590
So they would never again have

41:45.633 --> 41:47.983
to experience that kind
of fear and pain.

41:48.027 --> 41:51.334
The thing I can't reconcile is,
they understand

41:51.378 --> 41:53.511
what it's like to have
their home destroyed, and

41:53.554 --> 41:56.557
now they're doing the same
to us.

41:56.601 --> 41:58.211
If they can feel,
they can connect.

41:58.254 --> 42:00.343
If we can make them aware
of what the DMA is doing,

42:00.387 --> 42:03.042
we have every reason to believe
that they'll stop it.

42:03.085 --> 42:05.044
I regret to say, Doctor, it is

42:05.087 --> 42:08.787
equally possible
that they already know

42:08.830 --> 42:11.441
and simply do not care.

42:17.665 --> 42:20.233
We sent DOTs down
to the planet's surface

42:20.276 --> 42:22.583
to scan for more
of the hydrocarbons.

42:22.627 --> 42:25.673
They recovered 16
unique compounds,

42:25.717 --> 42:28.415
including the two
that you interacted with today.

42:28.458 --> 42:32.419
We've begun testing.
Initial results indicate

42:32.462 --> 42:35.814
that each corresponds with
a different emotional state.

42:35.857 --> 42:37.380
Fascinating.

42:37.424 --> 42:40.253
Of course, the Rosetta stone
required two languages

42:40.296 --> 42:42.560
to understand the third.

42:44.083 --> 42:47.390
However, uh,
this is still an excellent

42:47.434 --> 42:49.654
starting point
for communication.

42:49.697 --> 42:51.743
Good job.

42:51.786 --> 42:54.093
Well done.

42:54.136 --> 42:55.747
Nice work, Captain.

42:55.790 --> 42:57.879
And Mr. Saru.

42:59.228 --> 43:03.058
I'll have my crew set course
for the hyperfield immediately.

43:08.498 --> 43:12.111
Mr. Saru,
if you could use a moment

43:12.154 --> 43:14.287
of respite
after the challenges of the day,

43:14.330 --> 43:17.595
you are welcome to join me
for a stroll on the holodeck.

43:20.249 --> 43:23.688
I would enjoy that immensely.

43:29.128 --> 43:31.826
DMA hits in 25 hours.

43:31.870 --> 43:36.657
Take whoever you need to assist
with testing the chemicals.

43:36.701 --> 43:38.224
This data, Captain,

43:38.267 --> 43:40.966
changes everything.

43:41.009 --> 43:43.229
For the first time
in a long time,

43:43.272 --> 43:45.623
I feel hope.

43:46.841 --> 43:48.495
Like we can really do this.

43:48.538 --> 43:51.803
We can really find a way
to communicate with them.

43:51.846 --> 43:54.719
Thank you.

43:54.762 --> 43:57.286
It was all of us.

43:58.287 --> 44:01.987
And it will continue to be,
moving forward.

44:02.030 --> 44:05.686
So, thank you.

44:25.532 --> 44:26.838
General Ndoye?

44:26.881 --> 44:29.014
<i>
What is it?</i>

44:31.277 --> 44:33.975
It was good to see her.

44:37.239 --> 44:39.546
Thank you for letting me know
she was back.

44:39.589 --> 44:42.157
<i>You're welcome.</i>

44:56.868 --> 44:58.913
Hi.

44:58.957 --> 45:02.612
I heard about the hydrocarbons.

45:03.962 --> 45:06.660
Game changer.

45:06.704 --> 45:08.967
Yeah, I'm glad.

45:09.010 --> 45:12.013
So, how-how are you doing?

45:13.232 --> 45:16.148
It was... a tough day.

45:16.191 --> 45:18.541
Good, but tough.

45:18.585 --> 45:21.414
If you want to be alone,
that-that's totally cool.

45:21.457 --> 45:25.200
I just, um, thought maybe
if you... if you wanted company,

45:25.244 --> 45:27.637
I was just gonna hang
around here for a little bit.

45:27.681 --> 45:29.248
Company sounds good.

45:29.291 --> 45:31.554
Okay. Um...

45:33.426 --> 45:35.210
All right.

45:35.254 --> 45:36.908
Oh, by the way, um,

45:36.951 --> 45:40.215
I did fly good today,
so thank you for that.

45:40.259 --> 45:43.523
Yes. We maybe
just don't even ever have

45:43.566 --> 45:45.394
to mention that,
like, ever again.

45:45.438 --> 45:48.615
Or we could mention it every day
for the rest of your life.

45:48.658 --> 45:50.660
Okay.

45:50.704 --> 45:52.924
Good.

45:56.797 --> 45:59.495
You asked to see me?

45:59.539 --> 46:02.194
Please sit.

46:11.029 --> 46:13.248
Is this mavi?

46:19.211 --> 46:20.952
It tastes like home.

46:20.995 --> 46:23.998
I'm glad
the replicator got it right.

46:27.306 --> 46:31.136
I saw you lingering
in the nursery.

46:31.179 --> 46:34.052
When we were leaving.

46:34.095 --> 46:36.663
It was nice.

46:37.664 --> 46:40.754
To feel
those few moments of peace...

46:42.364 --> 46:43.626
I just wished I could

46:43.670 --> 46:46.804
stay in that a little longer.

46:48.283 --> 46:50.024
You know, a while ago, uh,

46:50.068 --> 46:54.768
Dr. Kovich told me
to take some time for myself,

46:54.812 --> 46:58.119
and I've tried... but, uh...

47:01.731 --> 47:04.560
...it seems
I've got deeper work to do.

47:08.347 --> 47:11.219
I'm not okay.

47:11.263 --> 47:13.526
How could you be,

47:13.569 --> 47:15.833
with everything you're facing?

47:15.876 --> 47:17.443
I mean, with everything
we're facing,

47:17.486 --> 47:19.445
I don't think anyone is okay.

47:19.488 --> 47:21.534
I keep thinking
about how we felt

47:21.577 --> 47:24.450
what the Ten-C felt today.

47:24.493 --> 47:27.714
Their fear, their love.

47:27.757 --> 47:30.499
And they destroyed Kwejian

47:30.543 --> 47:33.241
and Radvek Five.

47:33.285 --> 47:36.941
Sometimes empathy
can be uncomfortable.

47:36.984 --> 47:41.423
And it's the only way
to connect,

47:41.467 --> 47:44.078
to find common ground

47:44.122 --> 47:46.167
for communication.

47:46.211 --> 47:48.082
What if Saru was right?

47:48.126 --> 47:50.780
What if they know
what they've done,

47:50.824 --> 47:53.348
and they don't care?

47:53.392 --> 47:58.005
I mean, how do we connect
with a species like that?

47:58.049 --> 48:00.660
We'll find a way.

48:11.584 --> 48:13.586
The patch worked like a charm.

48:13.629 --> 48:14.979
We're attached to the hull,

48:15.022 --> 48:16.589
and Zora's sensors
don't have a clue.

48:16.632 --> 48:18.591
Well done.

48:18.634 --> 48:20.375
Got some news about the mission
to their planet.

48:20.419 --> 48:22.900
They're hoping to strike.

48:23.770 --> 48:25.293
Nothing like coming home

48:25.337 --> 48:27.339
to an unexpected hostage.
Am I right?
