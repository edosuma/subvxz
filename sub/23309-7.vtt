Learn the unknown English words
of this movie at www.skeebdo.com

00:13.276 --> 00:14.627
- Shalom.
- Shalom.

00:14.690 --> 00:16.158
Will you be dining
alone, sir?

00:16.226 --> 00:17.626
Uh, no, actually,
I'm expecting

00:17.693 --> 00:20.029
my wife and daughter
any minute now.

00:20.096 --> 00:23.265
Uh, two Cabernets
and a lemonade, please.

00:23.332 --> 00:24.799
Of course.

00:41.021 --> 00:42.690
Never a dull moment.

00:43.935 --> 00:45.505
Thank you.

01:04.909 --> 01:06.760
Miss, are you okay?

01:09.070 --> 01:10.789
We need some help here.

01:10.968 --> 01:13.070
Help! She needs help!

01:24.718 --> 01:26.047
Liad Meidar,

01:26.256 --> 01:28.791
a brilliant Israeli-American
nuclear physicist

01:28.860 --> 01:30.796
who disappeared 29 years ago

01:30.865 --> 01:32.562
after a café bombing
in Tel Aviv.

01:32.721 --> 01:34.456
Long presumed dead,

01:34.531 --> 01:35.898
but he may have
just been located

01:35.967 --> 01:38.069
in North Korea.
How do we know?

01:38.138 --> 01:40.974
Because the North Koreans
were just dumb enough

01:41.043 --> 01:42.929
to send out his picture
in this propaganda photo

01:42.998 --> 01:44.834
from their latest
ICBM test launch.

01:44.912 --> 01:46.780
None of those guys
look very Israeli.

01:46.863 --> 01:49.172
Yeah, so thought
the North Koreans, Mills.

01:50.425 --> 01:52.760
More Israeli
than Korean now, no?

01:53.298 --> 01:55.406
The DNI believes
it's Liad Meidar.

01:55.572 --> 01:57.673
They believe he's been
held captive all these years

01:57.742 --> 02:00.078
and forced to work for
the DPRK's nuclear program.

02:00.180 --> 02:02.148
- That's horrible.
- Horrible, right?

02:02.215 --> 02:03.687
I mean, just...
Just gut-wrenching.

02:03.756 --> 02:05.689
Bright young thinker like that

02:05.758 --> 02:09.922
co-opted by a hostile and
disgracefully inept government.

02:10.086 --> 02:11.892
Forced to do its...

02:12.031 --> 02:13.898
Excuse me...
High-end dirty work.

02:14.363 --> 02:17.265
Meidar would be an invaluable
intelligence asset.

02:17.495 --> 02:19.265
He was a rising star
in the '80s.

02:19.334 --> 02:20.701
His biggest breakthrough

02:20.793 --> 02:22.358
was with miniaturized warheads.

02:22.427 --> 02:24.616
Which the North Koreans recently
developed for themselves.

02:24.685 --> 02:26.724
Exactly,
which means he might've just

02:26.793 --> 02:29.257
outlived his usefulness...
To them, anyway.

02:29.328 --> 02:31.497
We need to know
everything he knows.

02:31.564 --> 02:33.666
I don't know, 29 years?

02:33.897 --> 02:36.194
You sure this guy's
working against his will?

02:36.491 --> 02:38.171
Look, if Meidar
had wanted North Korea

02:38.238 --> 02:39.571
to have miniaturized warheads,

02:39.638 --> 02:41.007
they would've had them
20 years ago.

02:41.086 --> 02:42.546
All right,
so then we just

02:42.615 --> 02:44.650
waltz into North Korea
and pull this guy out.

02:44.719 --> 02:46.187
Without anyone
knowing it's us.

02:46.265 --> 02:48.468
This whole thing
is a nuclear tinderbox.

02:48.537 --> 02:49.929
To be clear, okay,

02:49.998 --> 02:52.032
we're talking about
the most isolated, secretive,

02:52.254 --> 02:54.624
and uniform society
on the entire planet,

02:54.693 --> 02:56.293
and one of you
is a 6'2" white dude,

02:56.545 --> 02:58.513
so failure is
very much an option.

02:58.582 --> 03:00.538
If you are caught,
we're on our own.

03:00.607 --> 03:02.074
The DNI will deny you exist.

03:02.169 --> 03:03.505
But on the off chance
you succeed,

03:03.574 --> 03:04.610
the DNI will take
all the credit,

03:04.679 --> 03:06.514
so I mean, you know,
you'll always have that.

03:06.815 --> 03:08.757
Can I count
on you two for this?

03:10.851 --> 03:12.718
- How do we find this guy?
- Already did.

03:12.866 --> 03:16.314
I took an old photo
of Meidar from August '89

03:16.383 --> 03:19.100
and I aged it up to produce
this approximate image

03:19.197 --> 03:20.670
of what he would
look like today.

03:20.781 --> 03:23.397
- Ajna did that?
- No, Ajna didn't do that.

03:23.466 --> 03:24.499
That-That's my own code.

03:24.568 --> 03:26.429
All Ajna did was
take this new image

03:26.476 --> 03:29.835
to cough up geo-coordinates
of Meidar's latest location,

03:29.904 --> 03:31.271
which really,
to hear myself say it,

03:31.340 --> 03:32.474
is kind of impressive.

03:32.543 --> 03:34.111
What I can't tell you, however,

03:34.180 --> 03:36.703
is how to sneak the Odd Couple

03:36.772 --> 03:38.429
across the border safely.

03:38.874 --> 03:40.718
Hmm, backpack
and some hiking boots.

03:41.007 --> 03:42.983
Only way in
is a bus from China.

03:43.156 --> 03:44.958
I know a spy who knows a guy.

03:45.856 --> 03:46.890
Let's go.

03:50.116 --> 03:51.383
Supreme Adventures.

03:51.598 --> 03:53.842
They take brave
and/or idiotic travelers

03:53.911 --> 03:56.046
on heavily regulated tours
of North Korea.

03:56.211 --> 03:57.712
My money's on idiotic.

03:59.097 --> 04:02.046
No phones,
no weapons on the tour.

04:02.115 --> 04:03.850
Not really feeling
this plan yet.

04:03.919 --> 04:05.029
What's the matter, Mills?

04:05.098 --> 04:07.241
Can't survive two hours
without your cell phone?

04:07.310 --> 04:08.777
No, I got reading material.

04:08.863 --> 04:10.532
North Korean children's books...

04:10.601 --> 04:12.735
Quickest way to grasp
an unfamiliar culture.

04:12.804 --> 04:13.874
That's great, Mills.

04:13.943 --> 04:16.084
Reading at a sixth grade
reading level, well done.

04:16.196 --> 04:17.130
Kidding.

04:17.713 --> 04:19.202
Hello.

04:21.709 --> 04:23.399
Are you guys looking
for a little adventure?

04:23.484 --> 04:25.987
Uh, we think so.
Is the tour safe?

04:26.054 --> 04:27.989
Safe? Of course.
It's totally safe.

04:28.056 --> 04:29.557
North Korea
just has a bum rap.

04:29.624 --> 04:31.558
Well, didn't someone die
on one of these things?

04:31.625 --> 04:32.850
Uh, no,

04:32.919 --> 04:34.530
someone got arrested
on the tour

04:34.599 --> 04:36.561
then later died
of natural causes, so...

04:36.914 --> 04:38.348
In a North Korean jail cell.

04:38.417 --> 04:41.538
It'll be totally safe
if you obey the laws.

04:42.489 --> 04:44.218
You guys wanna book
this tour or what?

04:44.287 --> 04:46.780
Um, yeah, yeah, okay.

04:46.849 --> 04:48.716
Uh, two tickets
on today's bus, please.

04:48.961 --> 04:50.444
- Today's?
- Mm.

04:50.600 --> 04:52.200
Honey, the paperwork
takes at least a week.

04:52.455 --> 04:54.741
Um, "honey,"
that's... that's sweet.

04:54.835 --> 04:57.179
You know what? Let me...
Let me talk to you for a minute.

04:57.255 --> 04:59.524
Um, now, I have proof

04:59.570 --> 05:01.305
that you've been
using this bus

05:01.372 --> 05:03.875
to smuggle Hollywood bootlegs
into North Korea...

05:03.942 --> 05:05.976
Capital offense
in that backwards-ass country.

05:06.043 --> 05:08.112
And that soldier
is gonna find out

05:08.179 --> 05:09.914
unless you put us
on that bus

05:09.981 --> 05:11.548
and inform the driver
that we have a new first stop.

05:11.615 --> 05:13.017
There you go.

05:13.084 --> 05:14.351
We'd hate to see you
get arrested.

05:14.418 --> 05:16.007
Okay, I'll make it work.

05:16.134 --> 05:17.702
You know,
I can redirect the bus,

05:17.777 --> 05:19.543
but it's gonna be
impossible to get off.

05:19.612 --> 05:21.069
That soldier's gonna be
riding with us.

05:21.138 --> 05:23.897
Don't worry.
I'll think of something.

05:24.399 --> 05:25.749
Thank you so much.

05:25.818 --> 05:27.352
Thanks.

05:38.050 --> 05:40.097
I'm starting to detect
somewhat of a theme

05:40.166 --> 05:41.769
in these children's books.

05:43.449 --> 05:44.982
So many perfect
little woods creatures

05:45.049 --> 05:47.352
living under the constant threat
of the malicious savages

05:47.419 --> 05:48.654
outside the forest.

05:51.022 --> 05:53.230
Hey, our stop is coming up.

05:53.299 --> 05:54.832
We're almost
at Meidar's location.

06:00.366 --> 06:01.466
Not a word.

06:04.566 --> 06:06.701
Don't worry.
It's totally safe.

06:07.813 --> 06:10.183
Needles just got
a bum rap, right?

06:11.847 --> 06:15.027
We were never here,
you understand?

06:25.674 --> 06:27.642
Oh, my God.
Stop the bus!

06:27.814 --> 06:29.876
I told him
I'd think of something.

06:35.892 --> 06:37.814
He'll be fine
in five minutes.

06:55.485 --> 06:58.273
The roof will be the best way
to avoid detection.

06:59.760 --> 07:01.394
You're not afraid
of heights, are you?

07:01.524 --> 07:03.826
Not if I'm being shot at.

07:04.935 --> 07:06.570
Okay.

07:06.639 --> 07:10.074
Three, two, one.

07:29.963 --> 07:31.430
Meidar's last known location

07:31.499 --> 07:33.336
isn't the hellscape
I was expecting.

07:33.445 --> 07:34.471
I've seen worse,

07:34.540 --> 07:36.406
but this is definitely
a prison.

07:36.936 --> 07:40.071
Fenced perimeter,
armed guards on the quad.

07:48.092 --> 07:49.993
And would you look at that?

07:52.537 --> 07:54.102
It's really him.

07:55.598 --> 07:58.234
Alive and well. Huh.

08:00.215 --> 08:01.945
What is this place?

08:02.830 --> 08:04.585
How do we get him
out of it?

08:10.030 --> 08:13.997
<font color=#FF00FF>*TAKEN*</font>
<font color=#00FF00>Season 02   Episode 07</font>
Title: <font color=#FFFF00>"Invitation Only"</font>

08:22.521 --> 08:24.786
How's our pothead
of a tour guide doing?

08:24.855 --> 08:26.289
Still foaming at the mouth?

08:26.519 --> 08:28.278
Nah, the bus is long gone.

08:28.349 --> 08:31.436
All right,
we are officially stranded

08:31.505 --> 08:33.106
in enemy territory.

08:43.486 --> 08:45.288
This is a pleasant surprise.

08:45.465 --> 08:47.146
Smuggled my satphone
in my backpack.

08:47.698 --> 08:49.566
I don't recall
authorizing that.

08:49.758 --> 08:51.028
I mean,
I figured it's better to...

08:51.097 --> 08:53.199
ask for forgiveness
than permission.

08:53.439 --> 08:55.374
Here's Mills, all right?
Hold on.

09:06.241 --> 09:07.396
Meidar's alive.

09:07.512 --> 09:09.739
He's living in some sort
of residential prison compound.

09:09.818 --> 09:10.888
It's gated and guarded.

09:10.957 --> 09:13.739
And Meidar isn't
the only white guy.

09:16.778 --> 09:17.928
See?

09:17.997 --> 09:20.146
Sounds like he's living
in one of North Korea's

09:20.279 --> 09:21.936
invitation-only zones.

09:22.005 --> 09:24.723
It's these communities
of kidnapped foreigners

09:24.792 --> 09:26.358
that sprouted up
in the late '70s

09:26.427 --> 09:28.721
during a state-sponsored
mass abduction campaign.

09:28.841 --> 09:31.157
Yeah, there were potentially
hundreds of kidnappings.

09:31.224 --> 09:32.825
Many of them were
Japanese teenagers,

09:32.892 --> 09:35.527
but North Korea took citizens
from any number of countries,

09:35.594 --> 09:37.325
like Italy and Thailand.

09:37.409 --> 09:39.278
That fence looks electrified.

09:39.642 --> 09:41.143
How many of these places
are there?

09:41.234 --> 09:43.403
Unclear. They were
longtime open secrets

09:43.470 --> 09:44.646
in the intelligence community.

09:44.715 --> 09:45.733
Yeah, man, where you been?

09:45.802 --> 09:47.172
They've been mainstream
since 2015.

09:47.241 --> 09:48.630
You gotta get yourself
on Reddit.

09:48.699 --> 09:50.341
All right,
the lady in the red shirt...

09:50.559 --> 09:53.195
That's Keiko Hanami.

09:53.544 --> 09:55.341
She disappeared
from a Japanese beach

09:55.410 --> 09:58.099
during a family vacation
in 1979.

09:58.168 --> 10:00.130
I'm literally reading
her obituary as we speak.

10:00.199 --> 10:02.100
How is a place like this
allowed to exist?

10:02.310 --> 10:03.552
It's a failure of diplomacy.

10:03.621 --> 10:05.271
Yeah, that,
and nobody discovered

10:05.381 --> 10:07.751
a million barrels of oil
buried beneath the quad.

10:07.820 --> 10:09.419
How soon can you
get to Meidar?

10:09.540 --> 10:10.677
Not until after sundown.

10:10.746 --> 10:11.948
But what then?

10:12.064 --> 10:13.817
We just leave
the others behind?

10:14.419 --> 10:15.886
I'm sorry, Bryan, but...

10:16.091 --> 10:18.394
that's the best
we're gonna do for today.

10:18.547 --> 10:20.364
- How soon can we have the exfil?
- Sit tight.

10:20.440 --> 10:21.582
I'm gonna talk
with my contact.

10:21.621 --> 10:23.100
Wait, that could be her
right now.

10:23.309 --> 10:24.737
Hello?
What if I told you

10:24.806 --> 10:27.005
I smuggled in
a second satphone?

10:33.052 --> 10:34.419
Are your people
still alive?

10:34.486 --> 10:36.155
As promised.

10:36.349 --> 10:38.289
They're almost ready
for their ride home,

10:38.403 --> 10:40.472
anytime after sundown
tonight.

10:41.456 --> 10:43.131
I told you
I would do this, but...

10:43.200 --> 10:45.036
No, no, no.

10:45.131 --> 10:47.398
We are beyond this part
of the conversation.

10:47.465 --> 10:49.068
But the risk is considerable.

10:49.135 --> 10:50.970
No one outside
of Chinese intelligence

10:51.037 --> 10:53.502
- is aware this asset exists.
- No one beyond this bench

10:53.571 --> 10:55.180
can know my team
is in the country.

10:55.250 --> 10:56.454
On any normal mission,

10:56.523 --> 10:58.426
I would have
three contingencies.

10:58.795 --> 11:01.141
But this isn't a normal
mission, is it, Kai?

11:01.316 --> 11:03.016
You gave me your word.

11:06.505 --> 11:08.094
You owe me your life.

11:10.006 --> 11:12.542
Okay.
I'll send the helicopter.

11:12.757 --> 11:16.219
But, Christina,
it has to start before sundown.

11:21.962 --> 11:24.464
Every night at 8:00 p.m.,
the state requires

11:24.531 --> 11:26.641
North Koreans
to turn on their TVs

11:26.710 --> 11:29.243
for a report from Dear Leader.

11:29.312 --> 11:32.477
It's a sort
of dystopian fireside chat.

11:32.743 --> 11:34.805
All eyes will be
on those screens,

11:34.874 --> 11:37.509
which means you two
can move out in daylight

11:37.578 --> 11:39.524
a full seven minutes
before sundown.

11:39.593 --> 11:41.469
They're making sure
all the TVs are on.

11:41.608 --> 11:43.454
Talk about
a captive audience.

11:43.541 --> 11:45.055
At 8:15,
a helicopter

11:45.124 --> 11:48.102
will be making its weekly
delivery to the docks.

11:48.211 --> 11:50.297
It'll be flown
by a Chinese asset.

11:50.680 --> 11:52.614
I wouldn't be angry
if you smuggled an M4

11:52.683 --> 11:53.782
inside that snack pack.

11:54.061 --> 11:55.129
Next time.

11:55.198 --> 11:57.232
You need to be
on that chopper

11:57.301 --> 11:59.070
when it lifts off at 8:20.

11:59.139 --> 12:00.750
You cannot be late.

12:05.638 --> 12:08.551
China will not risk
exposing its asset.

12:09.650 --> 12:10.984
Am I clear?

12:12.941 --> 12:14.668
Easy, easy.

12:15.426 --> 12:16.782
Liad Meidar?

12:16.933 --> 12:18.451
Nuclear physicist?

12:18.683 --> 12:21.074
Abducted 29 years ago
in a café in Tel Aviv?

12:21.175 --> 12:22.625
Just nod if I'm correct.

12:24.785 --> 12:26.058
Who are you?

12:26.274 --> 12:28.475
It's Bryan Mills.
This is Santana.

12:28.643 --> 12:29.777
We're Americans, Liad.

12:29.853 --> 12:30.930
We're here
to bring you home, sir.

12:30.999 --> 12:32.368
We have to move extremely fast.

12:32.437 --> 12:34.790
We have to be out of that door
in less than five minutes.

12:36.990 --> 12:39.524
Okay, I just need
to collect some papers.

12:39.593 --> 12:41.555
It's critical intelligence.

12:46.400 --> 12:48.101
We have to move, Liad.

12:54.585 --> 12:55.885
These are nothing...

12:55.954 --> 12:57.021
To-do lists.

13:02.700 --> 13:04.172
Who did you call?

13:06.083 --> 13:08.180
Who did you call, Liad?

13:09.109 --> 13:10.469
Security.

13:15.313 --> 13:16.347
Why would you call security?

13:16.735 --> 13:18.244
Because I praise Dear Leader

13:18.313 --> 13:19.815
and hate the vile Americans.

13:22.892 --> 13:24.392
If this is another
loyalty test,

13:24.467 --> 13:26.368
I think I just passed
with flying colors.

13:26.576 --> 13:28.243
This isn't a test.

13:28.970 --> 13:29.871
Look.

13:29.946 --> 13:31.719
Your daughter, Rachel,

13:31.788 --> 13:33.789
in 1989 when she was
three years old.

13:33.985 --> 13:36.368
This is her last month
in Rockville, Maryland,

13:36.437 --> 13:39.165
with your grandsons,
Lincoln and Dean.

13:42.535 --> 13:44.637
And if you ever
wanna meet them,

13:44.774 --> 13:47.977
you need to send the guards away
as soon as they get here.

13:48.442 --> 13:50.860
Forgive me.
They've tested me before.

13:50.929 --> 13:52.563
We're on the clock, Liad.

13:52.992 --> 13:55.180
We have to leave the second
you send those guards away.

13:55.249 --> 13:56.407
And how do I know
we won't be killed?

13:56.476 --> 13:58.278
Listen, they find
two Americans in your house,

13:58.347 --> 13:59.571
we are all dead.

14:02.287 --> 14:04.788
Mills!

14:06.999 --> 14:08.066
Stop.

14:08.135 --> 14:09.161
It's okay.

14:09.230 --> 14:10.833
These people are friends.

14:11.066 --> 14:13.223
Please be gentle.
He's my son.

14:14.233 --> 14:15.817
Is his mother in this house?

14:17.770 --> 14:19.637
You hear that?
It's the helicopter.

14:19.706 --> 14:21.208
It's the weekly delivery
for our store.

14:21.294 --> 14:22.637
It's our ride out of here.

14:22.706 --> 14:25.254
Leaves in ten minutes
with or without us.

14:25.583 --> 14:27.901
Liad, it's security.

14:33.878 --> 14:36.653
I'm okay.
False alarm. Thank you.

14:46.862 --> 14:48.575
Do we have a problem, Liad?

14:50.841 --> 14:51.908
Chopper just landed.

14:51.975 --> 14:53.114
Where's Mills?

14:53.183 --> 14:54.484
Two men.

14:54.678 --> 14:56.083
AK-47s.

14:56.180 --> 14:58.015
It was a false alarm.

14:58.419 --> 15:00.809
You make telephone call
by accident?

15:01.285 --> 15:02.752
That's correct.

15:11.498 --> 15:13.565
That's my son's bedroom.
Stop.

15:13.922 --> 15:17.090
I am the lead scientist
for your nuclear program.

15:17.159 --> 15:18.723
You disrespect me in my home,

15:18.792 --> 15:21.160
I'll see to it
you pay a price.

15:25.067 --> 15:26.701
That's enough.

15:26.885 --> 15:28.122
Let's go.

15:38.492 --> 15:40.140
We need more time.

15:40.246 --> 15:42.297
We can try,
but don't expect it.

15:44.594 --> 15:45.927
Are you okay, Joon?

15:45.996 --> 15:48.008
What is happening?

15:48.077 --> 15:49.289
Hey, come here.
I know.

15:49.358 --> 15:50.592
We need to go.

15:50.661 --> 15:51.629
Now.

15:51.720 --> 15:53.921
We'll leave when he's ready.

15:56.243 --> 15:57.777
They're here to take us
someplace different,

15:57.846 --> 15:59.164
someplace better.

15:59.233 --> 16:00.430
But we need to leave
right away, okay?

16:00.499 --> 16:01.867
But I do not want to leave.

16:02.010 --> 16:03.797
We are not allowed to leave.

16:04.540 --> 16:06.320
Remember when you
were little...

16:06.389 --> 16:08.524
The bedtime stories
I read to you?

16:08.684 --> 16:10.785
Boston Tea Party,
the Statue of Liberty,

16:10.937 --> 16:13.008
Princess Rachel
from the land of Tel Aviv?

16:13.077 --> 16:14.311
Fairy tales.

16:14.472 --> 16:15.907
Pretend stories.

16:15.976 --> 16:17.360
Those places
and those things,

16:17.429 --> 16:20.031
they're all real, Joon,
and if we leave right now,

16:20.100 --> 16:21.805
we can go see them.

16:22.078 --> 16:23.938
It's what your mother
always wanted.

16:25.582 --> 16:28.252
Guys, it's now or never.

16:28.734 --> 16:29.867
What do you say, Joon?

16:29.936 --> 16:31.516
Would you like to meet Rachel?

16:35.222 --> 16:36.989
Okay, great, let's go.

16:37.066 --> 16:38.570
Oh, wait.

16:38.955 --> 16:40.430
As chief scientist,

16:40.499 --> 16:42.625
I have special privileges

16:42.703 --> 16:44.274
with trust and access.

16:45.396 --> 16:47.335
I wasn't kidding about
the critical intelligence.

16:47.404 --> 16:48.913
Where's the fastest way
to the docks?

16:48.982 --> 16:50.828
I know a way.
Come on.

16:54.630 --> 16:55.764
Leaving now.

16:56.068 --> 16:57.466
Five minutes.

16:57.651 --> 17:00.349
Hurry, I was only able
to get you 60 more seconds.

17:01.818 --> 17:03.085
What's in the case?

17:03.207 --> 17:04.342
Every vulnerability

17:04.411 --> 17:06.044
in the North Korean
nuclear program.

17:06.113 --> 17:07.747
Enough to set them back years.

17:07.825 --> 17:09.215
I would've done it myself,

17:09.285 --> 17:10.560
but they would've
killed my son.

17:10.628 --> 17:12.654
Thank you for saving him.

17:13.089 --> 17:15.193
Oh, you can thank me
when we're in the air.

17:17.179 --> 17:19.147
Come on.
Move, move, move.

17:21.535 --> 17:22.973
Hold on.

17:23.117 --> 17:25.465
All right, as soon
as they clear out,

17:25.535 --> 17:26.590
we make our move.

17:26.660 --> 17:27.992
30 yards to the chopper.

17:28.061 --> 17:30.131
Then we're home. Okay?

17:30.203 --> 17:32.154
Hey, Joon,
it's all right.

17:32.223 --> 17:33.466
You're gonna love it
in America.

17:33.535 --> 17:36.004
When I say go, we run.

17:36.226 --> 17:37.607
You ready?

17:37.676 --> 17:38.888
All right.

17:39.311 --> 17:40.716
Hey!
Hey, Joon!

17:40.800 --> 17:42.005
Joon!

17:42.803 --> 17:44.003
Take this
and get on the chopper.

17:44.072 --> 17:45.272
Tell Hart I need
another minute.

17:45.341 --> 17:46.747
Hey, I am not leaving
without you.

17:46.816 --> 17:48.536
This case is more important
than any of us.

17:48.605 --> 17:50.507
You get it to safety now.

17:50.607 --> 17:52.701
Go! Now!

18:07.290 --> 18:09.102
He won't talk to me.

18:09.417 --> 18:12.653
I offer my son a chance
at a better life, at freedom,

18:12.962 --> 18:15.102
and he ran the other way
because he doesn't believe me.

18:15.171 --> 18:17.739
He trusts state propaganda more
than he trusts his own father.

18:17.808 --> 18:19.079
No.

18:19.708 --> 18:21.454
He's just afraid.

18:23.413 --> 18:24.735
Why wouldn't he be?

18:24.804 --> 18:26.170
This is all he's ever known.

18:26.618 --> 18:27.883
You're right.

18:28.033 --> 18:30.797
His entire existence
is based on lies...

18:30.931 --> 18:32.533
Lies I told him.

18:32.655 --> 18:34.579
To protect him
from an awful truth.

18:34.712 --> 18:35.946
You want an awful truth?

18:36.032 --> 18:39.032
My 16-year-old son has
no idea what freedom is.

18:39.191 --> 18:41.102
He's never seen real beauty.

18:41.274 --> 18:44.243
That's not a life.
That's a facsimile of a life.

18:44.671 --> 18:46.383
A life not worth living.

18:48.747 --> 18:50.448
I'm gonna go talk to him.

18:56.501 --> 18:57.852
Hey, Joon.

18:58.008 --> 19:00.915
I'm Santana. We never got
a chance to officially meet.

19:01.911 --> 19:03.645
It's all right.
I get it.

19:04.056 --> 19:05.491
She's cute.

19:05.668 --> 19:07.360
I can see why she'd
be hard to leave.

19:11.666 --> 19:13.165
I read some of these.

19:13.571 --> 19:14.749
But you know what, Joon?

19:14.818 --> 19:16.852
The world is a lot
bigger and better

19:16.921 --> 19:18.076
than those books
will ever say,

19:18.145 --> 19:19.614
and I can prove it.

19:23.934 --> 19:24.944
Check it out.

19:25.013 --> 19:27.803
That's the Statue of Liberty.
See?

19:27.891 --> 19:30.092
It's not just a fairy tale.
It's a real place.

19:30.161 --> 19:32.831
And America 
stands for freedom.

19:33.044 --> 19:35.764
And anybody's allowed to visit
from anywhere in the world.

19:36.314 --> 19:38.325
You know how sometimes
you lose electricity?

19:38.463 --> 19:40.974
That doesn't happen
everywhere else.

19:41.444 --> 19:42.577
And what about this?

19:42.692 --> 19:44.357
That's nighttime in America.

19:44.480 --> 19:46.015
That's New York City,

19:46.125 --> 19:48.560
where people can be
anything they wanna be.

19:48.629 --> 19:51.513
These are pictures
on a telephone.

19:51.706 --> 19:53.274
Why should I believe you?

19:53.343 --> 19:54.997
Because I used to live there.

20:02.208 --> 20:05.052
North Korean kids are raised
to hate Americans,

20:05.121 --> 20:07.355
so I told you
I grew up in Israel.

20:07.424 --> 20:09.529
The truth is,
I'm a citizen of both.

20:09.598 --> 20:12.333
I didn't tell you sooner
because I was protecting you.

20:12.495 --> 20:14.786
I wanted you to think
your life was normal.

20:14.956 --> 20:16.625
Maybe it was a mistake,

20:16.694 --> 20:19.261
but I only lied to you
because I love you.

20:25.475 --> 20:26.622
30 years ago,

20:26.691 --> 20:29.927
I was taken from my old life
and forced to live here.

20:30.310 --> 20:33.080
It wasn't easy,
but I survived.

20:33.162 --> 20:35.755
You and Mom
made it easier for me.

20:36.247 --> 20:38.646
But I sure wouldn't mind
going back home.

20:39.026 --> 20:40.654
I think you'd
really like it there.

20:40.755 --> 20:42.599
What about everybody else?

20:43.053 --> 20:44.591
What about Ji-su?

20:44.891 --> 20:46.889
We just leave,

20:46.958 --> 20:49.163
and she never gets
to see all that?

20:50.952 --> 20:53.318
It's big of you
to even ask that, Joon.

20:53.684 --> 20:55.118
It is a good question.

20:55.473 --> 20:57.115
How do you help
an entire country

20:57.184 --> 20:58.986
understand
they're being lied to?

20:59.055 --> 21:01.716
I know they've seen hints
of the truth, just like you...

21:01.871 --> 21:04.286
TV and movies smuggled in
on thumb drives...

21:04.355 --> 21:06.310
But not enough
to make any sense of it.

21:06.725 --> 21:09.591
I have no idea
how to help these people.

21:10.210 --> 21:11.614
I have an idea.

21:11.683 --> 21:14.482
What if there was a way

21:14.845 --> 21:17.079
for those pictures
to be seen by everyone, Joon?

21:17.148 --> 21:18.451
How?

21:18.520 --> 21:19.786
You have your own car
for work

21:19.855 --> 21:21.482
with driving privileges,
right?

21:21.551 --> 21:24.732
We saw a radio tower
on the outside of town.

21:25.493 --> 21:28.091
If we could broadcast
those pictures to everybody,

21:29.135 --> 21:30.870
would you leave with us
for America?

21:32.434 --> 21:33.801
It's okay that you're scared,

21:33.870 --> 21:35.771
but we're gonna
keep you safe, Joon.

21:35.947 --> 21:37.919
I want to see Ji-su

21:38.392 --> 21:39.425
one last time.

21:39.494 --> 21:40.863
I meet her at lunch.

21:40.932 --> 21:42.232
I'm sorry, kid.
It's too dangerous.

21:42.301 --> 21:45.171
You want my trust.
I'm asking for yours.

21:45.240 --> 21:46.407
We can't risk that.

21:46.476 --> 21:47.919
I think we should.

21:50.414 --> 21:53.317
I do trust you.
Okay, Joon?

21:54.936 --> 21:57.685
Okay, well, for that to work,
we need to split up.

21:57.754 --> 21:59.200
Your dad and I
will go to the tower.

21:59.269 --> 22:02.172
Santana will stay here
while you meet up with Ji-su.

22:02.402 --> 22:04.552
Then we'll all meet up
for a rendezvous.

22:05.619 --> 22:07.152
Everyone okay with that?

22:07.221 --> 22:08.513
Absolutely not.

22:08.582 --> 22:10.516
I took a big risk
sending you that helicopter,

22:10.585 --> 22:11.622
and your team failed me

22:11.691 --> 22:13.513
by running
in the opposite direction.

22:13.906 --> 22:16.365
As far as I'm concerned,
we're even.

22:16.435 --> 22:18.357
There must be
something you want.

22:18.784 --> 22:20.357
There is.

22:20.923 --> 22:22.365
But you won't like it.

22:24.649 --> 22:25.731
Yusup Tursun.

22:25.800 --> 22:27.301
Yusup Tursun,

22:27.580 --> 22:30.622
the leader of the Eastern
Turkistan Islamic Movement?

22:31.068 --> 22:34.049
Right, he's responsible for six
terrorist attacks in China.

22:34.148 --> 22:35.333
We want him.

22:35.433 --> 22:37.033
The United States
doesn't have him.

22:37.108 --> 22:38.950
Perhaps you have
a piece of software

22:39.019 --> 22:40.763
that can help China
locate him.

22:43.179 --> 22:46.052
The U.S. hasn't put him
on a kill list yet either.

22:46.213 --> 22:48.529
Do you want
your people back or not?

22:56.138 --> 22:58.052
Can I ask you
about Joon's mother?

22:59.267 --> 23:01.036
Li-Hua Chen.

23:01.259 --> 23:04.154
She was just a beautiful woman.

23:04.485 --> 23:07.357
They forced us into a marriage
so we could have a child.

23:07.470 --> 23:10.052
Someone they could kill
if you ever tried to leave.

23:11.477 --> 23:13.774
But love finds a way,
you know?

23:14.443 --> 23:15.727
We were just...

23:15.927 --> 23:17.829
everything to each other.

23:18.853 --> 23:20.274
But she died of TB

23:20.343 --> 23:22.977
because they wouldn't pay
for her antibiotics.

23:23.703 --> 23:25.055
I'm sorry.

23:25.542 --> 23:28.143
The thing I always
wonder about is,

23:28.429 --> 23:29.758
why me?

23:30.005 --> 23:31.751
Why did they choose me?

23:32.037 --> 23:33.872
Did they know I was weak?

23:33.955 --> 23:35.798
Did they know I would cave?

23:36.262 --> 23:38.001
Because I did.

23:38.957 --> 23:41.092
But I didn't
make it easy for them.

23:41.831 --> 23:43.946
I held out for seven years.

23:44.795 --> 23:46.173
They beat me.

23:46.242 --> 23:47.798
They starved me.

23:48.169 --> 23:50.688
They locked me in a room.

23:51.415 --> 23:54.274
But eventually I did crack.

23:54.904 --> 23:57.508
I went to work
in their nuclear lab.

23:57.577 --> 24:00.133
You made the most
of an impossible situation.

24:00.202 --> 24:02.204
That's what you did.

24:02.327 --> 24:05.227
You fell in love.
You had a son.

24:05.296 --> 24:07.164
You built a life for yourself.

24:07.308 --> 24:08.805
I want you to know

24:08.954 --> 24:10.391
that every step of the way,

24:10.460 --> 24:12.665
I sabotaged
their nuclear program.

24:12.734 --> 24:14.670
I replicated every setback

24:14.790 --> 24:16.735
anybody had ever documented.

24:18.309 --> 24:20.110
That makes you a hero.

24:22.059 --> 24:23.193
And when we leave here,

24:23.268 --> 24:24.969
people are gonna
know the truth.

24:27.356 --> 24:29.391
You seeing that, Kilroy?
Yeah, loud and clear.

24:29.544 --> 24:31.044
Did you get your laptop
in a sync circuit?

24:31.113 --> 24:32.758
Meidar did.

24:33.292 --> 24:35.055
What's your read
on the security?

24:35.124 --> 24:37.423
Uh, light,
maybe a couple of guards,

24:37.492 --> 24:40.133
but your access point is on
the west side of the bridge.

24:40.202 --> 24:42.399
Meidar's gonna patch me
into the tower, yes?

24:42.553 --> 24:44.079
- Yeah.
- Okay, let me talk to him.

24:44.148 --> 24:45.555
Let me walk him
through the procedure.

24:45.672 --> 24:48.395
- He wants to talk to you.
- Hello?

24:48.464 --> 24:50.059
Okay, Meidar,
we don't have a lot of time.

24:50.179 --> 24:51.947
I-I need you
to listen very closely

24:52.016 --> 24:53.762
and do exactly as I say.

25:32.059 --> 25:33.394
Hey.

25:33.463 --> 25:35.216
How you feeling?

25:36.160 --> 25:38.095
I'm leaving forever

25:38.172 --> 25:40.864
and was not allowed
to say good-bye.

25:41.612 --> 25:43.047
And I did not.

25:43.458 --> 25:45.527
You had a nice hug, though.

25:46.222 --> 25:47.880
You were watching?

25:48.430 --> 25:50.216
I didn't think
that unmarried couples

25:50.285 --> 25:51.583
were allowed to hug
in North Korea.

25:51.652 --> 25:53.950
Was that the first time
you did that?

25:55.756 --> 25:56.923
It...

25:56.992 --> 25:58.434
just happened.

25:58.900 --> 26:00.100
All right.

26:00.169 --> 26:01.551
Um...

26:01.620 --> 26:03.169
go pack up your stuff, okay?

26:03.238 --> 26:04.614
We're gonna leave early.

26:15.055 --> 26:16.422
Come on.

26:49.387 --> 26:51.053
Drop it.

26:58.853 --> 27:00.521
Speak to me.

27:01.066 --> 27:03.033
Nothing no problem.

27:12.660 --> 27:13.758
Just had a run-in
with a guard,

27:13.827 --> 27:14.900
so he might've got off
an alert.

27:14.969 --> 27:15.986
You seeing any movement?

27:16.055 --> 27:17.079
No, right now,
you're all alone,

27:17.148 --> 27:18.650
but I wouldn't dillydally.

27:29.766 --> 27:34.119
Father, I'm worried about Joon.

27:42.897 --> 27:44.566
Radio tower, come in.

27:45.481 --> 27:47.082
Radio tower, come in.

27:53.510 --> 27:56.603
We might
have a problem at the tower.

27:59.382 --> 28:00.583
How's Mills?

28:00.652 --> 28:02.486
Halfway through
a suicide mission.

28:02.555 --> 28:03.845
Why don't you tell me?

28:04.443 --> 28:06.779
Can you run this name
through Ajna, please?

28:08.158 --> 28:09.806
Yusup Tursun.

28:10.058 --> 28:11.650
Sounds like
a Uyghur separatist

28:11.728 --> 28:13.408
or a rebel pilot
from "Rogue One."

28:13.477 --> 28:14.556
Why's he important?

28:14.625 --> 28:16.314
Just run the name, please.

28:18.053 --> 28:20.456
He's... he is a Uyghur
separatist, isn't he?

28:21.386 --> 28:22.586
Wanted by the Chinese.

28:22.655 --> 28:24.435
You want me to track him down
so you can trade his life

28:24.504 --> 28:25.619
for a new exfil plan.

28:25.688 --> 28:27.728
Um, this might come
as some surprise to you,

28:27.797 --> 28:29.892
seeing as how I'm enchained
and everything,

28:29.961 --> 28:31.681
but I've never actually
killed anybody before.

28:31.750 --> 28:34.697
I am just asking you
to find somebody.

28:34.766 --> 28:36.308
Yeah, who's gonna be dead
by the weekend.

28:36.377 --> 28:37.408
Perhaps, but if you don't,

28:37.477 --> 28:40.033
maybe Mills and Santana
don't make it to sundown.

28:43.025 --> 28:45.697
Look, as an anarchist, okay,

28:45.766 --> 28:48.034
I'm not particularly
excited by the idea

28:48.103 --> 28:51.409
of playing executioner
for a nation-state, all right?

28:51.478 --> 28:52.767
But as a Homo sapiens,

28:52.836 --> 28:55.142
I-I'm really
uncomfortable playing God.

28:55.211 --> 28:56.650
Tursun is a butcher

28:56.726 --> 28:59.423
with the lives of 37 innocent
civilians on his hands.

28:59.492 --> 29:02.048
I have been given the
opportunity to trade his life

29:02.117 --> 29:03.634
for the life of our teammates.

29:03.703 --> 29:04.813
Teammates,
bit of a stretch,

29:04.882 --> 29:05.962
but okay, I'm listening.

29:06.031 --> 29:08.197
Look, people are
gonna die either way,

29:08.266 --> 29:09.534
that's a fact,

29:09.696 --> 29:11.712
so don't think of it
as deciding who to kill.

29:11.790 --> 29:13.712
Think of it
as deciding who to save.

29:13.851 --> 29:15.782
And if that's what you call
playing God, Kilroy,

29:15.851 --> 29:17.071
then so be it,
but you know what?

29:17.140 --> 29:18.853
It's not always
gonna be this easy.

29:57.136 --> 29:58.706
- How we doing?
- I don't know.

29:58.775 --> 30:00.386
Maybe five more minutes?

30:06.580 --> 30:07.408
Yeah.

30:07.477 --> 30:08.854
There's a vehicle
on the approach,

30:08.923 --> 30:11.573
and I got a million bucks
that says it's not Amazon Prime.

30:12.449 --> 30:14.058
I'm on it.

30:16.150 --> 30:17.750
Keep working.

30:32.257 --> 30:34.605
Go in! I got him.

30:59.838 --> 31:01.307
You okay?

31:03.435 --> 31:05.036
I'm not done yet.

31:05.627 --> 31:08.129
There's no shame
in leaving now, Liad.

31:11.115 --> 31:14.049
No, just another minute.

31:15.243 --> 31:16.777
Okay.

31:21.404 --> 31:22.799
Definitely not Amazon.

31:22.868 --> 31:24.010
Mills, get the hell
out of there.

31:24.079 --> 31:25.292
You got three military trucks
six miles out

31:25.361 --> 31:26.895
with no regard for speed limit,
all right?

31:26.964 --> 31:29.292
You gotta get the hell
out of there.

31:29.948 --> 31:31.315
How we doing there, Liad?

31:31.383 --> 31:32.573
Almost.

31:32.642 --> 31:34.135
'Cause we have
a situation outside

31:34.204 --> 31:35.939
and we need to leave right now.

31:36.093 --> 31:37.929
I'm almost done.

31:38.783 --> 31:40.050
I'll call you back.

31:47.874 --> 31:49.181
We got about five minutes

31:49.250 --> 31:51.253
before more guys
show up with guns.

31:51.666 --> 31:54.001
Whenever you wanna go,
I got your back,

31:54.070 --> 31:55.878
but we should probably go.

31:56.534 --> 31:58.964
I made a promise to my son.

31:59.129 --> 32:02.198
Do you wanna know
why they chose you, Liad?

32:02.414 --> 32:04.456
It's because
you're exceptional.

32:04.630 --> 32:07.455
You crippled the North Korean
nuclear program

32:07.650 --> 32:10.575
for two decades
and never got caught.

32:11.424 --> 32:13.552
And that was the hard part.

32:13.804 --> 32:16.865
Now you just gotta
connect an antenna.

32:17.924 --> 32:19.659
You can do this.

32:24.054 --> 32:26.221
You can do this, Liad.

32:44.960 --> 32:47.474
- Okay.
- Wait, it's electric!

32:50.104 --> 32:51.584
Hey!

32:53.427 --> 32:56.397
Where are you going?

32:56.914 --> 32:58.749
You heard me.

32:59.159 --> 33:01.543
Where is your father?

33:01.698 --> 33:02.766
Huh?

33:04.164 --> 33:06.200
You can tell me.

33:06.475 --> 33:08.009
Joon, move!

33:14.414 --> 33:15.781
It's okay.

33:15.850 --> 33:17.420
Don't worry, Joon, all right?

33:17.489 --> 33:19.928
Funnest part is gonna be
stealing that car.

33:19.997 --> 33:21.435
Okay.

33:22.294 --> 33:23.591
Let's go.

33:26.949 --> 33:29.320
Yusup Tursun's
last known location

33:29.389 --> 33:30.781
as of 19 minutes ago.

33:30.890 --> 33:33.031
Pleasure doing business.

33:41.959 --> 33:43.458
You good to go?

33:43.574 --> 33:45.075
Thank you.

33:46.195 --> 33:47.763
How we looking out there,
Kilroy?

33:47.832 --> 33:48.833
Well, the good news is,

33:48.902 --> 33:50.201
I got the radio tower
signal here.

33:50.270 --> 33:51.474
If Meidar
installed it properly,

33:51.543 --> 33:53.576
they won't discover
the hack until we use it,

33:53.803 --> 33:56.560
so I'll able to broadcast after
you're, uh, you know, killed.

33:57.187 --> 33:58.787
Copy that.

34:04.796 --> 34:06.801
You trained in
the Israeli military, right?

34:07.009 --> 34:08.344
That was a long time ago.

34:08.413 --> 34:10.348
Well, it ain't
rocket science.

34:26.661 --> 34:28.206
Gun.

34:28.732 --> 34:29.899
You drive.

34:40.196 --> 34:41.696
Start the car!

34:45.513 --> 34:47.414
Go! Go! Go!

34:49.900 --> 34:51.222
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

34:51.385 --> 34:53.393
Reverse, reverse.

34:54.208 --> 34:55.525
When I say "now," brake

34:55.594 --> 34:57.150
and turn right
as hard as you can.

34:57.220 --> 34:58.659
Now!

35:08.496 --> 35:09.806
Bryan?

35:22.042 --> 35:23.399
Bryan!

35:25.233 --> 35:26.734
Bryan!

35:28.924 --> 35:30.522
Stay straight, Liad!

35:30.591 --> 35:32.326
He's not slowing down.

35:37.779 --> 35:40.081
Do not stop!
Do not turn!

35:41.182 --> 35:42.749
You need to shoot!

35:42.816 --> 35:44.751
Stay the course, Liad.

35:44.818 --> 35:46.219
Stay the course.

35:46.286 --> 35:48.105
Easy.

35:59.254 --> 36:01.056
You wanna go home?

36:01.297 --> 36:02.897
It's on my to-do list.

36:05.958 --> 36:07.825
Good.
Good.

36:09.251 --> 36:11.011
Hart's contact
is sending a mini sub.

36:11.080 --> 36:12.191
Should be here
in a few minutes.

36:12.260 --> 36:13.980
- We gotta make this fast.
- Yeah.

36:16.871 --> 36:19.183
Do we need to worry
about him?

36:20.257 --> 36:22.126
Kid's having a hard time.

36:23.980 --> 36:25.548
Do you mind
if I talk to him?

36:25.617 --> 36:26.752
Go ahead.

36:37.154 --> 36:39.489
I know this is all
a lot to take in,

36:39.596 --> 36:41.676
but what your dad
did today for you

36:41.745 --> 36:43.191
and for the people
of North Korea

36:43.260 --> 36:45.261
is one of the bravest
things I've ever seen.

36:45.942 --> 36:47.783
And the reason he did it
is the same reason

36:47.852 --> 36:49.910
he does everything else
in his life...

36:51.733 --> 36:53.957
'cause he loves you.

37:01.843 --> 37:03.699
Can I ask for your help,
Joon?

37:07.605 --> 37:10.340
This briefcase has
the name and picture

37:10.409 --> 37:11.902
of every foreigner
in North Korea

37:11.971 --> 37:13.506
being held against their will.

37:14.106 --> 37:15.347
If you're ready,

37:15.416 --> 37:18.218
I think you should be the one
to turn over the files.

37:20.416 --> 37:22.049
Only if you're ready.

37:25.946 --> 37:27.815
I'm ready, Dad.

37:36.284 --> 37:38.144
Let's go.

37:39.525 --> 37:40.941
You got a minute, Kilroy?

37:41.010 --> 37:43.177
Oh, want me
to kill somebody else?

37:44.536 --> 37:46.113
No, I was hoping you could

37:46.182 --> 37:48.308
send me that photo-aging
code that you wrote.

37:48.478 --> 37:50.449
Oh, sure thing, you can...

37:50.660 --> 37:52.054
You can age up the Earth,

37:52.123 --> 37:54.090
watch... watch the whole thing
just melt away.

37:54.197 --> 37:56.032
It's very disturbing.

37:56.261 --> 37:58.030
Something else?

37:59.652 --> 38:01.118
What you did for us
this week...

38:01.246 --> 38:03.182
Oh, no, are you arresting me?

38:04.748 --> 38:06.883
Thought maybe we should
set that bitch free.

38:06.974 --> 38:08.160
What, this guy right here?

38:08.229 --> 38:09.277
Mm-hmm.

38:09.346 --> 38:10.686
Oh, that's
a very lovely gesture.

38:10.755 --> 38:12.707
I actually hacked it
two weeks ago.

38:15.103 --> 38:18.506
Look, I'm not saying
that I like you guys.

38:18.921 --> 38:21.379
Uh, because, you know, I don't.

38:21.598 --> 38:24.933
But, uh, I-I am saying
that I think...

38:25.089 --> 38:27.082
I think you're interesting,

38:27.378 --> 38:28.894
if not a little,

38:28.963 --> 38:30.824
you know, insane.

38:32.146 --> 38:34.238
Just don't forget
to send me the code.

40:23.319 --> 40:24.639
"Kilroy was here?"

40:24.716 --> 40:25.950
Seriously?

40:26.019 --> 40:27.587
Never even left the SCIF.

40:27.656 --> 40:29.625
We should be thankful
it wasn't porn.

40:30.977 --> 40:32.845
It's Meidar's family.

40:32.990 --> 40:34.271
Heads up.

40:35.064 --> 40:36.332
Hello, sunshine.

40:36.485 --> 40:38.319
I'm sorry I didn't call.

40:43.855 --> 40:45.287
Hey, baby girl.

40:45.390 --> 40:47.412
Have I got a story for you.

40:52.529 --> 40:55.365
This is Joon, your brother.

40:55.573 --> 40:57.326
Joon, this is Rachel,

40:57.425 --> 40:59.225
the princess of Tel Aviv.

41:10.119 --> 41:11.643
Nice work, you guys.

41:13.745 --> 41:16.534
Yeah, it's gonna look great
on the DNI's résumé.
