WEBVTT

00:16.475 --> 00:20.105
We are under attack. There are creatures.

00:20.229 --> 00:22.527
I don't even think they're human.
We can't stop them.

00:22.606 --> 00:25.701
The clock is broken. He's coming.

00:25.776 --> 00:27.904
Did you hear what I said?

00:29.279 --> 00:32.783
Listen to me.
There is a man coming to Versailles.

00:32.866 --> 00:36.291
He has watched over me my whole life
and he will not desert me tonight.

00:36.411 --> 00:38.505
What are you talking about? What man?

00:38.580 --> 00:41.504
The only man, save you, I have ever loved.

00:41.625 --> 00:45.220
No, don't look like that. There's no time.
You have your duties.

00:45.295 --> 00:48.014
I am your mistress. Go to your queen.

00:49.967 --> 00:52.641
Are you there? Can you hear me?

00:54.054 --> 00:58.434
I need you now, you promised.
The clock on the mantel is broken.

00:58.517 --> 01:00.064
It is time.

01:00.143 --> 01:02.396
Doctor! Doctor!

01:55.157 --> 01:59.913
It's a spaceship. Brilliant!
I got a spaceship on my first go.

01:59.995 --> 02:02.293
Looks kind of abandoned.
Anyone on board?

02:02.372 --> 02:05.046
Nah, nothing here.
Well, nothing dangerous.

02:05.167 --> 02:07.295
Well, not that dangerous.

02:08.586 --> 02:10.806
You know what? Iâ€™ll just have a quick scan.

02:10.881 --> 02:13.760
In case there's anything dangerous.

02:13.842 --> 02:17.016
So, what's the date? How far have we gone?

02:17.095 --> 02:19.848
About 3,000 years into your future,
give or take.

02:21.725 --> 02:23.648
51st century.

02:24.478 --> 02:27.607
The Dagmar Cluster,
you're a long way from home, Mickey!

02:27.689 --> 02:29.191
Two and a half galaxies.

02:29.274 --> 02:31.868
Mickey Smith, meet the universe.

02:32.903 --> 02:35.122
See anything you like?

02:35.197 --> 02:36.915
It's so realistic!

02:37.074 --> 02:41.921
Dear me, had some cowboys in here.
Been a ton of repair work going on.

02:44.206 --> 02:48.962
Now that's odd, look at that.
All the warp engines are going.

02:50.504 --> 02:52.097
Full capacity.

02:53.048 --> 02:56.769
There's enough power running through
this ship to punch a hole in the universe

02:56.885 --> 02:59.138
and we're not moving.

02:59.262 --> 03:00.764
So where's all that power going?

03:00.847 --> 03:02.770
Where'd all the crew go?

03:02.849 --> 03:04.851
Good question. No life readings on board.

03:04.935 --> 03:08.360
Well, we're in deep space.
They didn't just nip out for a quick fag.

03:08.438 --> 03:10.611
No, I've checked all the smoking pods.

03:12.526 --> 03:14.824
- You smell that?
- Yeah. Someone's cooking.

03:14.903 --> 03:16.371
Sunday roast, definitely.

03:22.536 --> 03:26.632
Now, there's something you don't see
in your average spaceship.

03:27.666 --> 03:30.385
18th century. French.

03:30.877 --> 03:32.254
Nice mantel.

03:33.714 --> 03:35.341
Not a hologram.

03:36.633 --> 03:41.230
Not even a reproduction. This actually is
an 18th-century French fireplace.

03:41.304 --> 03:43.398
Double-sided.
There's another room through there.

03:43.473 --> 03:45.771
It can't be. That's the outer hull
of the ship. Look.

03:45.851 --> 03:47.945
- Hello.
- Hello?

03:48.019 --> 03:50.488
- What's your name?
- Reinette.

03:50.564 --> 03:52.862
Reinette. That's a lovely name.

03:52.983 --> 03:55.657
Can you tell me where you are
at the moment, Reinette?

03:55.736 --> 03:57.329
In my bedroom.

03:57.738 --> 04:00.116
And where's your bedroom?
Where do you live, Reinette?

04:00.198 --> 04:02.701
- Paris of course.
- Paris. Right.

04:03.410 --> 04:06.414
Monsieur, what are you doing
in my fireplace?

04:06.496 --> 04:10.421
Oh, it's just a routine... fire check.

04:10.500 --> 04:12.002
Can you tell me what year it is?

04:12.085 --> 04:15.339
Of course I can. 1727.

04:15.464 --> 04:18.091
Right, lovely, one of my favourites.

04:18.591 --> 04:21.141
August is rubbish, though. Stay indoors.

04:21.219 --> 04:24.098
Okay, that's all for now.
Thanks for your help.

04:24.181 --> 04:26.525
Hope you enjoy the rest of the fire.
Night-night.

04:26.600 --> 04:28.352
Good night, monsieur.

04:28.477 --> 04:30.104
You said this was the 51st century.

04:30.187 --> 04:33.428
I also said this ship was generating enough
power to punch a hole in the universe.

04:33.523 --> 04:35.571
I think we just found the hole.

04:35.650 --> 04:38.403
- Must be a spatio-temporal hyperlink.
- What's that?

04:38.528 --> 04:42.374
No idea, just made it up.
Didn't want to say "magic door".

04:42.491 --> 04:47.213
And on the other side of the "magic door"
it's France in 1727?

04:47.329 --> 04:50.674
Well, she was speaking French.
Right period French, too.

04:50.749 --> 04:52.422
She was speaking English, I heard her.

04:52.501 --> 04:54.299
That's the Tardis, translates for you.

04:54.377 --> 04:56.175
- Even French?
- Yep.

04:57.047 --> 04:58.924
- Got you.
- Doctor!

05:25.534 --> 05:29.630
It's okay. Don't scream.
It's me. It's the fireplace man, look.

05:33.542 --> 05:36.011
We were talking. just a moment ago.
I was in your fireplace.

05:36.086 --> 05:39.681
Monsieur, that was weeks ago.
That was months.

05:39.798 --> 05:42.176
Really? Hmm.

05:45.595 --> 05:49.441
Must be a loose connection.
Need to get a man in.

05:49.516 --> 05:52.315
Who are you and what are you doing here?

05:55.605 --> 05:58.905
- Okay. That's scary.
- You're scared of a broken clock?

05:58.984 --> 06:01.282
Just a bit scared, yeah.
Just a little tiny bit.

06:01.403 --> 06:04.452
'Cause, you see, if this clock's broken,

06:04.573 --> 06:07.122
and it's the only clock in the room,

06:09.619 --> 06:11.496
then what's that?

06:14.541 --> 06:17.420
'Cause, you see, that's not a clock.

06:17.502 --> 06:20.426
You can tell by the resonance. Too big.

06:22.841 --> 06:27.142
Six feet, I'd say. Size of a man.

06:27.846 --> 06:29.769
What is it?

06:29.848 --> 06:31.566
Now let's think.

06:31.641 --> 06:34.269
If you were a thing that ticked
and you were hiding in someone's bedroom,

06:34.394 --> 06:35.896
first thing you do, break the clock.

06:36.021 --> 06:39.195
No one notices the sound
of one clock ticking, but two?

06:41.359 --> 06:44.533
You might start to wonder
if you're really alone.

06:47.657 --> 06:49.910
Stay on the bed. Right in the middle.

06:49.993 --> 06:53.042
Don't put your hands or feet over the edge.

07:18.021 --> 07:21.150
Reinette, don't look round.

07:22.859 --> 07:25.282
You stay exactly where you are.

07:31.701 --> 07:33.749
Hold still, let me look.

07:35.872 --> 07:38.295
You've been scanning her brain!

07:39.417 --> 07:41.377
You've crossed two galaxies
and thousands of years

07:41.378 --> 07:43.005
just to scan a child's brain?

07:43.088 --> 07:46.718
What could there be in a little girl's mind
worth blowing a hole in the universe?

07:46.800 --> 07:48.643
I don't understand.

07:48.718 --> 07:50.220
It wants me?

07:51.137 --> 07:52.639
You want me?

07:53.348 --> 07:55.692
Not yet. You are incomplete.

07:55.767 --> 07:58.771
Incomplete?
What does that mean, incomplete?

07:58.853 --> 08:02.574
You can answer her, you can answer me.
What do you mean, incomplete?

08:07.445 --> 08:09.197
Monsieur, be careful!

08:09.280 --> 08:11.400
It's just a nightmare, Reinette.
Don't worry about it.

08:11.449 --> 08:13.497
Everyone has nightmares.

08:13.576 --> 08:17.080
Even monsters from under the bed
have nightmares. Don't you, Monster?

08:17.163 --> 08:19.507
What do monsters have nightmares about?

08:19.582 --> 08:20.879
Me. Ha!

08:23.586 --> 08:24.929
Doctor!

08:37.433 --> 08:39.152
Excellent. Ice gun.

08:39.269 --> 08:40.566
Fire extinguisher.

08:40.687 --> 08:42.655
- Where did that thing come from?
- Here.

08:42.772 --> 08:44.149
So why is it dressed like that?

08:44.274 --> 08:47.118
Field trip to France.
Some kind of basic camouflage protocol.

08:47.235 --> 08:49.988
Nice needlework. Shame about the face.

08:51.281 --> 08:54.751
Oh, you are beautiful!

08:56.119 --> 08:59.623
No, really, you are. You're gorgeous.
Look at that!

08:59.789 --> 09:02.508
Space age clockwork. I love it.
I've got chills!

09:02.584 --> 09:04.086
Listen, seriously,

09:04.169 --> 09:06.547
I mean this from the heart,
and by the way, count those,

09:06.629 --> 09:10.725
it would be a crime,
it would be an act of vandalism,

09:10.800 --> 09:12.643
to disassemble you.

09:13.428 --> 09:14.975
But that won't stop me.

09:20.769 --> 09:23.192
Short-range teleport. Can't have got far.
Could still be on board.

09:23.313 --> 09:25.736
- What is it?
- Don't go looking for it.

09:25.815 --> 09:28.238
- Where are you going?
- Back in a sec.

09:34.699 --> 09:37.669
- He said not to look for it.
- Yeah, he did.

09:43.416 --> 09:45.464
Now you're getting it.

09:50.006 --> 09:51.349
Reinette?

09:52.467 --> 09:54.390
Just checking you're okay.

10:06.231 --> 10:08.108
Oh. Hello!

10:10.527 --> 10:14.748
I was just looking for Reinette.
This is still her room, isn't it?

10:15.448 --> 10:18.042
I've been away, not sure how long.

10:18.118 --> 10:20.496
Reinette? We're ready to go!

10:20.578 --> 10:23.923
Go to the carriage, Mother,
I will join you there.

10:27.127 --> 10:29.801
It is customary, I think,
to have an imaginary friend

10:29.879 --> 10:32.223
only during one's childhood.

10:32.382 --> 10:35.056
You are to be congratulated
on your persistence.

10:35.135 --> 10:36.512
Reinette.

10:38.388 --> 10:40.311
Well...

10:40.390 --> 10:41.983
Goodness, how you've grown.

10:42.058 --> 10:45.358
And you do not appear
to have aged a single day.

10:45.854 --> 10:48.152
That is tremendously impolite of you.

10:48.231 --> 10:50.575
Right, yes, sorry. Um...

10:52.777 --> 10:56.623
Listen, lovely to catch up
but better be off, eh?

10:56.739 --> 10:59.868
Don't want your mother finding you
up here with a strange man, do we?

10:59.951 --> 11:02.500
Strange?
How could you be a stranger to me?

11:02.579 --> 11:04.923
I have known you
since I was seven years old.

11:05.081 --> 11:09.052
Yeah, I suppose you have.
I came the quick route.

11:13.923 --> 11:17.018
You seem to be flesh and blood at any rate,
but this is absurd.

11:17.093 --> 11:19.642
Reason tells me you cannot be real.

11:19.762 --> 11:22.766
Oh, you never want to listen to reason.

11:23.933 --> 11:26.903
Mademoiselle?
Your mother grows impatient.

11:26.978 --> 11:28.400
A moment!

11:29.856 --> 11:32.780
So many questions. So little time.

11:43.953 --> 11:46.081
Mademoiselle Poisson!

11:57.550 --> 11:58.893
Poisson?

12:00.803 --> 12:03.181
Reinette Poisson. No!

12:03.890 --> 12:06.734
No, no, no, no! No way! Reinette Poisson.

12:06.809 --> 12:09.107
Later Madame d'Etioles.
Later still, mistress of Louis XV,

12:09.187 --> 12:10.939
uncrowned Queen of France!

12:11.022 --> 12:14.652
Actress, artist, musician,
dancer, courtesan.

12:14.734 --> 12:16.532
Fantastic gardener.

12:18.404 --> 12:20.782
Who the hell are you?

12:20.865 --> 12:25.041
I'm the Doctor.
And I just snagged Madame de Pompadour.

12:29.624 --> 12:30.796
Rose!

12:32.710 --> 12:36.556
Mickey! Every time. Every time!
It's rule one. Don't wander off.

12:36.631 --> 12:38.804
I tell them, I do. Rule one.

12:38.883 --> 12:41.636
There could be anything on this ship!

13:01.030 --> 13:03.032
Are you looking at me?

13:06.077 --> 13:07.875
Look! Look at this!

13:11.040 --> 13:14.044
That's an eye in there. That's a real eye.

13:31.728 --> 13:33.526
What is that?

13:33.604 --> 13:37.325
What's that in the middle there?
Looks like it's wired in.

13:37.400 --> 13:39.323
It's a heart, Mickey.

13:40.987 --> 13:42.864
It's a human heart.

13:45.658 --> 13:46.910
Rose?

13:53.583 --> 13:56.928
Will you stop following me?
I'm not your mother.

14:01.424 --> 14:04.268
So this is where you came from,
eh, horsey?

14:10.683 --> 14:13.311
Oh, Katherine, you are too wicked.

14:15.063 --> 14:16.485
Oh, speaking of wicked,

14:16.564 --> 14:20.068
I hear Madame de Chateauroux is ill
and close to death.

14:20.151 --> 14:23.826
- Yes, I am devastated.
- Oh, indeed.

14:23.905 --> 14:26.749
I, myself, am frequently inconsolable.

14:28.284 --> 14:31.254
The King will therefore
be requiring a new mistress.

14:31.329 --> 14:32.831
You love the King, of course.

14:32.914 --> 14:36.168
He is the King
and I love him with all my heart.

14:36.709 --> 14:39.212
And I look forward to meeting him.

14:42.924 --> 14:45.222
Is something wrong, my dear?

14:45.802 --> 14:47.349
Not wrong, no.

14:49.305 --> 14:51.728
Every woman in Paris
knows your ambitions.

14:51.808 --> 14:53.810
Every woman in Paris
shares them.

14:53.893 --> 14:56.574
You know, of course, that the King
is to attend the Yew Tree Ball...

15:03.319 --> 15:06.664
- Maybe it wasn't a real heart.
- Of course it was a real heart.

15:08.741 --> 15:11.711
Is this like, normal for you?
Is this an average day?

15:11.828 --> 15:15.082
Life with the Doctor, Mickey,
no more average days.

15:15.206 --> 15:17.959
It's France again. We can see France.

15:19.168 --> 15:22.012
I think we're looking through a mirror.

15:23.548 --> 15:25.221
Blimey, look at this guy!

15:25.299 --> 15:27.552
- Who does he think he is?
- King of France.

15:27.635 --> 15:30.935
- Oh, here's trouble. What you been up to?
- Oh, this and that.

15:31.013 --> 15:33.294
Became the imaginary friend
of a future French aristocrat,

15:33.349 --> 15:34.942
picked a fight with a clockwork man.

15:36.477 --> 15:38.104
Oh, and I met a horse.

15:38.187 --> 15:40.531
What's a horse doing on a spaceship?

15:40.606 --> 15:42.779
Mickey, what's pre-revolutionary France
doing on a spaceship?

15:42.859 --> 15:44.406
Get a little perspective.

15:44.485 --> 15:47.989
See these?
They're all over the place, on every deck.

15:48.156 --> 15:50.079
Gateways to history.

15:50.616 --> 15:54.041
But not just any old history. Hers.

15:54.704 --> 15:56.627
Time window.

15:56.706 --> 15:59.835
Deliberately arranged
along the life of one particular woman.

15:59.917 --> 16:04.718
A spaceship from the 51st century
stalking a woman from the 18th.

16:05.006 --> 16:07.179
- Why?
- Who is she?

16:07.258 --> 16:09.932
Jean-Antoinette Poisson.
Known to her friends as Reinette.

16:10.011 --> 16:11.971
One of the most accomplished women
who ever lived.

16:12.054 --> 16:13.977
So has she got plans
for being the queen, then?

16:14.056 --> 16:17.902
No, he's already got a queen.
She's got plans on being his mistress.

16:17.977 --> 16:21.322
Oh, I get it. Camilla!

16:23.232 --> 16:25.826
I think this is the night they met.

16:25.902 --> 16:27.779
The night of the Yew Tree Ball.

16:27.862 --> 16:30.702
In no time flat, she'll get herself
established as his official mistress

16:30.740 --> 16:33.084
with her own rooms at the palace,
even her own title.

16:33.159 --> 16:35.002
Madame de Pompadour.

16:40.208 --> 16:42.210
The Queen must have loved her.

16:42.293 --> 16:44.762
No, she did. They got on very well.

16:44.837 --> 16:46.760
The King's wife and the King's girlfriend?

16:46.881 --> 16:49.009
France. It's a different planet.

16:55.139 --> 16:58.518
How long have you been standing there?
Show yourself!

17:02.813 --> 17:04.815
Hello, Reinette, hasn't time flown!

17:04.941 --> 17:06.909
Fireplace man!

17:14.200 --> 17:17.704
- What's it doing?
- Switching back on. Melting the ice.

17:17.787 --> 17:20.882
- And then what?
- Then it kills everyone in the room.

17:20.957 --> 17:24.928
Focuses the mind, doesn't it?
Who are you? Identify yourself.

17:25.962 --> 17:27.635
Order it to answer me.

17:27.797 --> 17:29.219
Why should it listen to me?

17:29.298 --> 17:32.097
I don't know,
but it did when you were a child.

17:32.176 --> 17:34.679
Let's see if you've still got it.

17:35.012 --> 17:36.889
Answer his question.

17:37.932 --> 17:40.936
Answer any and all questions put to you.

17:44.855 --> 17:46.357
I am Repair Droid 7.

17:46.482 --> 17:48.576
And what happened to the ship, then?

17:48.651 --> 17:50.904
There was a lot of damage.

17:50.987 --> 17:53.581
[on storm. 82% systems failure.

17:53.656 --> 17:56.956
That ship hasn't moved in over a year.
What's taken you so long?

17:57.034 --> 17:59.253
We did not have the parts.

18:00.621 --> 18:03.249
Always comes down to that, doesn't it?
The parts.

18:03.332 --> 18:05.209
What's happened to the crew?
Where are they?

18:05.293 --> 18:07.045
We did not have the parts.

18:07.128 --> 18:10.132
There should've been over 50 people
on your ship. Where did they go?

18:10.214 --> 18:11.761
We did not have the parts.

18:11.841 --> 18:14.845
Fifty people don't just disappear, where...

18:16.095 --> 18:17.221
Oh.

18:19.056 --> 18:22.356
You didn't have the parts
so you used the crew.

18:23.185 --> 18:24.528
The crew?

18:26.397 --> 18:29.071
We found a camera with an eye in it.

18:29.483 --> 18:33.454
And there was a heart
wired into machinery.

18:34.739 --> 18:37.492
It's just doing what it was programmed to.

18:37.575 --> 18:41.546
Repairing the ship any way it can
with whatever it can find.

18:42.121 --> 18:44.419
No one told it
the crew weren't on the menu.

18:44.498 --> 18:47.547
What did you say
the flight deck smelled of?

18:48.711 --> 18:50.429
Someone cooking.

18:50.504 --> 18:52.222
Flesh plus heat.

18:53.299 --> 18:54.642
Barbecue.

18:56.218 --> 18:57.936
But what are you doing here?

18:58.054 --> 19:00.807
You've opened up time windows,
that takes colossal energy.

19:00.890 --> 19:03.734
Why come here?
You could've gone to your repair yard.

19:03.809 --> 19:06.813
Instead you come to 18th-century France?
Why?

19:06.896 --> 19:08.773
One more part is required.

19:13.527 --> 19:16.030
Then why haven't you taken it?

19:16.113 --> 19:17.911
She is incomplete.

19:19.450 --> 19:21.248
What? So that's the plan, then?

19:21.327 --> 19:23.830
Just keep opening up
more and more time windows,

19:23.913 --> 19:26.792
scanning her brain,
checking to see if she's done yet?

19:26.874 --> 19:28.376
Why her?

19:30.419 --> 19:34.925
You've got all of history to choose from,
why specifically her?

19:35.591 --> 19:37.685
We are the same.

19:37.760 --> 19:40.263
We're not the same.
We are in no sense the same!

19:40.388 --> 19:42.607
- We are the same.
- Get out of here.

19:42.682 --> 19:45.105
- Get out of here this instant.
- Reinette, no.

19:45.643 --> 19:48.692
It's back on the ship! Rose, take Mickey
and Arthur, get after it, follow it.

19:48.771 --> 19:50.364
Don't approach it, just watch what it does.

19:50.439 --> 19:52.032
- Arthur?
- Good name for a horse.

19:52.108 --> 19:56.329
- No, you're not keeping the horse.
- I let you keep Mickey. Now go, go, go!

19:59.740 --> 20:02.664
You're going to have to trust me. I need
to find out what they're looking for.

20:02.743 --> 20:06.122
There's only one way I can do that.
Won't hurt a bit.

20:09.166 --> 20:10.759
Fireplace man.

20:11.252 --> 20:13.380
You are inside my mind.

20:13.462 --> 20:15.260
Oh, clear, Reinette.

20:15.840 --> 20:17.808
You've had some cowboys in here.

20:18.467 --> 20:21.641
- So, that Doctor, eh?
- What are you talking about?

20:21.762 --> 20:25.437
Well! Madame de Pompadour,
Sarah Jane Smith.

20:25.599 --> 20:28.068
- Cleopatra...
- Cleopatra! He mentioned her once!

20:28.144 --> 20:30.943
- Yeah, but he called her Cleo.
- Mickey!

20:40.239 --> 20:43.493
You are in my memories.
You walk among them.

20:43.576 --> 20:45.336
If there's anything
you don't want me to see,

20:45.411 --> 20:48.631
just imagine a door and close it.
I won't look.

20:50.332 --> 20:53.336
Oh, actually, there's a door just there,
you might want to close...

20:53.419 --> 20:55.421
Oh. Actually, several.

20:57.465 --> 21:00.469
To walk among the memories
of another living soul.

21:00.551 --> 21:03.771
- Do you ever get used to this?
- I don't make a habit of it.

21:03.846 --> 21:06.975
- How can you resist?
- What age are you?

21:07.057 --> 21:10.687
So impertinent a question
so early in the conversation.

21:11.645 --> 21:14.273
- How promising.
- Not my question. Theirs.

21:14.356 --> 21:18.532
You're 23. And for some reason
that means you're not old enough.

21:18.611 --> 21:22.582
Sorry. You might find old memories
reawakening. Side effect.

21:22.865 --> 21:24.742
Oh, such a lonely childhood.

21:24.825 --> 21:26.873
It'll pass. Stay with me.

21:27.953 --> 21:32.629
Oh, Doctor. So lonely. So very, very alone.

21:32.708 --> 21:36.463
What do you mean, alone?
You've never been alone in your life.

21:36.545 --> 21:38.798
When did you start calling me Doctor?

21:38.881 --> 21:41.054
Such a lonely little boy.

21:41.133 --> 21:43.431
Lonely then and lonelier now.

21:45.221 --> 21:48.225
- How can you bear it?
- How did you do that?

21:49.225 --> 21:53.401
A door once opened
may be stepped through in either direction.

21:54.605 --> 21:56.073
Oh, Doctor.

21:56.899 --> 21:58.651
My lonely Doctor.

22:01.487 --> 22:03.080
Dance with me.

22:03.531 --> 22:04.703
I can't.

22:04.782 --> 22:06.659
Dance with me.

22:06.742 --> 22:08.790
This is the night you dance with the King.

22:08.869 --> 22:10.997
Then first I shall make him jealous.

22:11.080 --> 22:13.378
- I can't.
- Doctor.

22:15.251 --> 22:16.719
Doctor who?

22:19.880 --> 22:22.679
It's more than just a secret, isn't it?

22:23.300 --> 22:25.348
What did you see?

22:26.679 --> 22:29.683
That there comes a time, Time Lord,

22:29.765 --> 22:32.939
when every lonely little boy
must learn how to dance.

22:45.865 --> 22:49.039
What is this? What's going on? Doctor?

22:49.118 --> 22:50.620
Rose?

22:52.371 --> 22:54.251
They're going to chop us up.
Just like the crew!

22:54.290 --> 22:57.260
They're going to chop us up and stick us
all over their stupid spaceship.

22:57.334 --> 22:59.757
And where's the Doctor?
Where's your precious Doctor now?

22:59.837 --> 23:03.717
He's been gone for ï¬‚ipping hours,
that's where he is!

23:03.799 --> 23:05.642
You are compatible.

23:07.261 --> 23:10.561
Well, you might want to think about that.

23:10.973 --> 23:14.523
You really, really might
because me and Mickey,

23:15.311 --> 23:17.689
we didn't come here alone, no, no.

23:17.813 --> 23:21.909
And trust me, you wouldn't want to mess
with our designated driver.

23:27.114 --> 23:30.163
Ever heard of the Daleks? Remember them?

23:30.659 --> 23:32.536
They had a name for our friend.

23:32.661 --> 23:36.165
They had myths about him and a name.
They called him the...

23:36.290 --> 23:40.170
â™ª I could have danced all night

23:40.252 --> 23:42.675
They called him...

23:42.796 --> 23:46.676
â™ª And still have begged for more

23:47.009 --> 23:50.183
â™ª I could have spread my wings
And done a... â™ª

23:50.304 --> 23:52.432
Have you met the French?

23:52.514 --> 23:55.939
My God, they know how to party!

23:56.018 --> 23:59.443
Oh, look at what the cat dragged in.
The Oncoming Storm.

23:59.563 --> 24:01.315
You sound just like your mother.

24:01.398 --> 24:03.366
What have you been doing?
Where have you been?

24:03.442 --> 24:05.536
Well, among other things,

24:05.611 --> 24:09.536
I think I just invented the banana daiquiri
a couple of centuries early.

24:09.657 --> 24:12.536
Do you know,
they'd never even seen a banana before?

24:12.618 --> 24:15.497
Always take a banana to a party, Rose.

24:15.579 --> 24:19.709
Bananas are good. Oh, brilliant.

24:20.042 --> 24:21.965
It's you!

24:22.044 --> 24:24.342
You're my favourite, you are.

24:24.421 --> 24:26.423
You are the best. Do you know why?

24:26.507 --> 24:29.181
'Cause you're so thick.

24:29.426 --> 24:32.475
You're Mr Thick Thick Thicketty Thick-face

24:32.554 --> 24:34.898
from Thick-town, Thickania.

24:35.891 --> 24:38.064
And so is your dad.

24:38.185 --> 24:41.564
Do you know what they were scanning
Reinette's brain for?

24:41.689 --> 24:45.739
Her milometer.
They want to know how old she is.

24:45.985 --> 24:50.240
Know why? 'Cause this ship is 37 years old.

24:50.364 --> 24:54.335
And they think when Reinette is 37,
when she's complete,

24:54.410 --> 24:56.959
then her brain will be compatible.

24:57.705 --> 25:00.254
'Cause that's what you're missing,
isn't it, hmm?

25:00.374 --> 25:02.752
Command circuit, your computer.

25:02.876 --> 25:07.177
Your ship needs a brain.
And for some reason, God knows what,

25:07.256 --> 25:10.726
only the brain
of Madame de Pompadour will do.

25:11.760 --> 25:14.263
The brain is compatible.

25:14.346 --> 25:15.814
Compatible?

25:16.765 --> 25:21.111
If you believe that, you probably
believe this is a glass of wine.

25:29.194 --> 25:32.448
Multi-grade anti-oil. If
it moves, it doesn't.

25:38.454 --> 25:42.800
Right, you two, that's enough lying about.
Time we got the rest of the ship turned off.

25:42.875 --> 25:44.969
- Those things safe?
- Yep, safe.

25:45.085 --> 25:46.678
Safe and thick. The way I like them.

25:46.795 --> 25:48.638
Okay, all the time windows
are controlled from here.

25:48.714 --> 25:52.639
Need to close them all down.
Zeus plugs. Where are my Zeus plugs?

25:52.760 --> 25:54.512
Had them a minute ago.
I was using them as castanets.

25:54.595 --> 25:57.144
Why didn't they just open a time window
to when she was 37?

25:57.222 --> 25:59.896
Amount of damage to these circuits,
they did well to hit the right century.

25:59.975 --> 26:02.069
Trial and error after that.

26:02.144 --> 26:04.738
The windows aren't closing.
Why won't they close?

26:06.356 --> 26:08.609
- What's that?
- I don't know.

26:08.692 --> 26:10.740
- Incoming message?
- From who?

26:10.819 --> 26:12.446
Report from the field.

26:12.529 --> 26:14.489
One of them must still be out there
with Reinette.

26:14.490 --> 26:17.790
That's why I can't close the windows.
There's an override.

26:23.499 --> 26:25.467
That was a bit clever.

26:29.171 --> 26:32.675
Right.
Many things about this are not good.

26:34.510 --> 26:37.559
Message from one of your little friends?
Anything interesting?

26:37.638 --> 26:39.857
She is complete. It begins.

26:44.269 --> 26:45.896
What's happening?

26:45.979 --> 26:47.822
One of them must have found
the right time window.

26:47.898 --> 26:49.366
It's time to send in the troops.

26:49.483 --> 26:51.656
And this time
they're bringing back her head.

27:04.706 --> 27:06.253
Madame de Pompadour.

27:06.333 --> 27:09.052
Please don't scream or anything,
we haven't got a lot of time.

27:09.169 --> 27:11.968
We've come to warn you
that they'll be here in five years.

27:12.047 --> 27:13.469
Five years?

27:13.549 --> 27:16.143
Sometime after your 37th birthday.

27:16.969 --> 27:21.270
I, um, I can't give you an exact date,
it's a bit random.

27:21.390 --> 27:24.189
But they're coming. It's gonna happen.

27:25.352 --> 27:28.322
In a way, for us, it's already happening.

27:29.731 --> 27:33.531
I'm sorry, it's hard to explain.
The Doctor does this better.

27:33.610 --> 27:35.738
Then be exact and I will be attentive.

27:35.821 --> 27:38.745
- There isn't time.
- There are five years.

27:38.824 --> 27:41.077
For you. I haven't got five minutes.

27:41.160 --> 27:43.083
Then also be concise.

27:45.914 --> 27:47.416
Urn...

27:48.458 --> 27:51.587
There's a vessel.

27:51.920 --> 27:56.266
A ship. A sort of sky ship.
And it's full of...

27:57.467 --> 27:59.515
Well, you.

27:59.595 --> 28:02.974
Different bits of your life
in different rooms. All jumbled up.

28:03.098 --> 28:05.897
I told you it was complicated, sorry.

28:06.435 --> 28:09.609
There is a vessel in your world

28:09.688 --> 28:11.816
where the days of my life
are pressed together

28:11.940 --> 28:13.817
like the chapters of a book

28:13.901 --> 28:17.451
so that he may step from one to the other
without increase of age

28:17.571 --> 28:20.370
while I, weary traveller,

28:20.449 --> 28:22.827
must always take the slower path.

28:22.910 --> 28:24.912
He was right about you.

28:26.079 --> 28:29.379
So in five years these creatures will return.
What can be done?

28:29.458 --> 28:31.131
The Doctor says keep them talking.

28:31.210 --> 28:34.510
They're kind of programmed
to respond to you now.

28:34.630 --> 28:38.260
You won't be able to stop them,
but you might be able to delay them a bit.

28:38.342 --> 28:41.221
- Until?
- Until the Doctor can get there.

28:41.303 --> 28:43.726
- He's coming, then?
- He promises.

28:44.223 --> 28:47.227
But he cannot make his promises
in person?

28:48.477 --> 28:51.981
He'll be there when you need him.
That's the way it's got to be.

28:52.064 --> 28:54.487
It's the way it's always been.

28:54.900 --> 28:57.153
The monsters and the Doctor.

28:57.778 --> 29:00.372
It seems you cannot have one
without the other.

29:00.447 --> 29:02.495
Tell me about it.

29:04.201 --> 29:07.956
The thing is,
you weren't supposed to have either.

29:08.622 --> 29:11.000
Those creatures are messing with history.

29:11.124 --> 29:13.172
None of this was ever
supposed to happen to you.

29:13.252 --> 29:16.176
Supposed to happen?
What does that mean?

29:17.089 --> 29:21.014
It happened, child.
And I would not have it any other way.

29:21.802 --> 29:25.432
One may tolerate a world of demons
for the sake of an angel.

29:28.809 --> 29:31.028
Rose? Rose!

29:32.854 --> 29:34.231
Rose!

29:34.356 --> 29:38.862
The time window where she's 37.
We've found it, right under our noses.

29:42.322 --> 29:45.701
No, you can't go in there.
The Doctor will go mad.

29:52.874 --> 29:54.751
So this is his world.

29:57.254 --> 29:59.006
What was that?

29:59.089 --> 30:01.467
The time window.
The Doctor fixed an audio link.

30:01.550 --> 30:04.850
Those screams. Is that my future?

30:05.512 --> 30:07.310
Yeah, I'm sorry.

30:07.389 --> 30:09.812
Then I must take the slower path.

30:09.891 --> 30:12.770
Are you there? Can you hear me?

30:12.853 --> 30:16.903
I need you now. You promised. The clock
on the mantel is broken. It is time!

30:16.982 --> 30:18.234
That's my voice.

30:18.358 --> 30:20.736
Rose, come on, we've got to go.
There's a problem.

30:20.819 --> 30:22.537
Give me a moment.

30:29.828 --> 30:31.546
- You okay?
- No.

30:32.247 --> 30:34.045
I'm very afraid.

30:34.124 --> 30:37.173
But you and I both know, don't we, Rose?

30:37.252 --> 30:39.755
The Doctor is worth the monsters.

30:47.137 --> 30:49.265
Doctor! Doctor!

31:06.782 --> 31:08.079
Doctor!

31:08.450 --> 31:11.329
We must go! No one is coming to help us.

31:20.379 --> 31:22.802
You are complete. You will come.

31:32.307 --> 31:33.729
You found it, then?

31:33.809 --> 31:36.278
They knew I was coming,
they've blocked it off.

31:36.353 --> 31:39.323
- Where are we going?
- The teleport has limited range.

31:39.398 --> 31:42.026
We must have proximity to the time portal.

31:42.150 --> 31:45.120
Your words mean nothing. You are nothing.

31:47.656 --> 31:50.284
- How come they got in there?
- They teleported.

31:50.367 --> 31:52.247
As long as the ship
and the ballroom are linked,

31:52.327 --> 31:53.874
their short-range teleports
will do the trick.

31:53.954 --> 31:57.003
- We'll go in the Tardis.
- We can't. We're part of events now.

31:57.082 --> 31:58.504
Can't we just smash through?

31:58.583 --> 32:00.631
Hyperplex this side, plate glass the other.
We'd need a truck.

32:00.710 --> 32:02.633
- We don't have a truck.
- I know!

32:02.712 --> 32:04.134
We've got to try something!

32:04.214 --> 32:05.841
No. Smash the glass,
smash the time windows.

32:05.924 --> 32:07.642
There'd be no way back.

32:07.717 --> 32:11.517
Could everyone just calm down!

32:12.180 --> 32:13.932
Please!

32:14.057 --> 32:17.186
Such a commotion. Such distressing noise.

32:17.310 --> 32:21.031
Kindly remember that this is Versailles.

32:21.231 --> 32:24.656
This is the Royal Court and we are French.

32:30.073 --> 32:32.041
I have made a decision.

32:32.659 --> 32:34.957
And my decision is no.

32:35.036 --> 32:37.880
I shall not be going with you today.

32:37.956 --> 32:41.961
I have seen your world and
I have no desire to set foot there again.

32:43.086 --> 32:45.384
We do not require your feet.

32:56.099 --> 33:00.229
You think I fear you,
but I do not fear you even now.

33:01.396 --> 33:05.742
You are merely
the nightmare of my childhood,

33:05.817 --> 33:07.990
the monster from under my bed.

33:08.069 --> 33:10.447
And if my nightmare
can return to plague me,

33:10.530 --> 33:13.249
then rest assured, so will yours.

33:47.442 --> 33:50.742
Madame de Pompadour.
You look younger every day.

33:51.613 --> 33:53.786
What the hell is going on?

33:53.907 --> 33:57.582
Oh. This is my lover, the King of France.

33:58.119 --> 34:00.918
Yeah? Well, I'm the Lord of Time.

34:03.833 --> 34:05.927
And I'm here to fix the clock.

34:08.547 --> 34:10.264
Forget it. It's over.

34:11.800 --> 34:13.427
For you and for me.

34:15.053 --> 34:17.556
Talk about seven years' bad luck.

34:18.848 --> 34:20.475
Try 5,000.

34:27.023 --> 34:28.991
What happened?

34:29.109 --> 34:32.909
Where did the time window go?
How's he gonna get back?

34:50.672 --> 34:53.221
The link with the ship is broken.
No way back.

34:55.010 --> 34:57.138
You don't have the parts.

34:58.722 --> 35:02.352
How many ticks left
in that clockwork heart, huh?

35:02.475 --> 35:04.523
A day? An hour?

35:06.021 --> 35:09.025
It's over. Accept that.

35:10.650 --> 35:12.652
I'm not winding you up.

35:28.043 --> 35:29.670
Are you all right?

35:31.755 --> 35:33.883
What's happened to them?

35:34.966 --> 35:36.718
They've stopped.

35:38.178 --> 35:40.272
They have no purpose now.

35:51.358 --> 35:54.032
We can't fly the Tardis without him.

35:54.402 --> 35:55.949
How's he gonna get back?

36:13.171 --> 36:15.765
You know all their names, don't you?

36:16.216 --> 36:18.560
I saw that in your mind.

36:18.635 --> 36:20.558
The name of every star.

36:20.637 --> 36:22.264
What's in a name?

36:22.389 --> 36:25.268
Names are just titles.
Titles don't tell you anything.

36:25.350 --> 36:27.273
Like "the Doctor"?

36:27.435 --> 36:29.608
Like "Madame de Pompadour".

36:32.399 --> 36:35.744
I have often wished to see those stars
a little closer.

36:35.819 --> 36:37.821
Just as you have, I think.

36:37.946 --> 36:39.744
From time to time.

36:40.490 --> 36:43.118
In saving me, you trapped yourself.

36:43.410 --> 36:45.458
Did you know that would happen?

36:45.537 --> 36:47.631
Hmm, pretty much.

36:47.789 --> 36:49.791
Yet still you came.

36:49.874 --> 36:53.549
Yeah, I did, didn't I?
Catch me doing that again.

36:55.588 --> 36:58.808
There were many doors
between my world and yours.

36:58.883 --> 37:01.102
Can you not use one of the others?

37:01.177 --> 37:02.554
When the mirror broke,

37:02.637 --> 37:04.798
the shock would've severed
all the links with the ship.

37:04.848 --> 37:09.399
There'll be a few more broken mirrors
and torn tapestries around here I'm afraid,

37:09.477 --> 37:11.650
wherever there was a time window.

37:11.730 --> 37:14.654
I'll pay for any damage.

37:16.609 --> 37:18.828
That's a thought, I'm gonna need money.

37:18.903 --> 37:20.997
I've always been a bit vague about money.

37:22.031 --> 37:24.375
Where do you get money?

37:24.451 --> 37:26.124
So here you are.

37:27.162 --> 37:29.164
My lonely angel.

37:29.789 --> 37:32.167
Stuck on the slow path with me.

37:32.292 --> 37:34.169
Yep. The slow path.

37:35.712 --> 37:37.305
Here's to the slow path.

37:42.969 --> 37:47.190
It's a pity.
I think I would have enjoyed the slow path.

37:48.016 --> 37:50.269
Well, I'm not going anywhere.

37:51.227 --> 37:52.854
Oh, aren't you?

37:54.731 --> 37:56.278
Take my hand.

38:18.213 --> 38:20.807
It's not a copy. It's the original.

38:21.800 --> 38:25.145
I had it moved here
and was exact in every detail.

38:26.721 --> 38:28.314
The fireplace.

38:31.309 --> 38:33.778
The fireplace from your bedroom.

38:36.272 --> 38:39.242
- When did you do this?
- Many years ago.

38:40.443 --> 38:44.744
In the hope that a door once opened
may someday open again.

38:46.950 --> 38:49.999
One never quite knows
when one needs one's doctor.

38:52.539 --> 38:55.509
It appears undamaged.
Do you think it will still work?

38:55.583 --> 38:57.677
You broke the bond with the ship
when you moved it.

38:57.752 --> 38:59.925
Which means it was off-line
when the mirror broke.

39:00.004 --> 39:01.927
That's what saved it.

39:03.216 --> 39:04.433
But...

39:05.885 --> 39:10.015
the link is basically physical
and it's still physically here,

39:12.225 --> 39:15.104
which might just mean, if I'm lucky,

39:15.186 --> 39:17.985
if I'm very, very, very,
very, very lucky...

39:20.149 --> 39:21.651
- Aha!
- What?

39:21.776 --> 39:23.699
Loose connection!

39:23.778 --> 39:25.655
Need to get a man in!

39:27.866 --> 39:30.540
- Wish me luck.
- No.

39:35.957 --> 39:37.800
Madame de Pompadour!

39:39.627 --> 39:41.220
Still wanna see those stars?

39:41.296 --> 39:44.140
- More than anything.
- Give me two minutes. Pack a bag.

39:44.215 --> 39:45.558
Am I going somewhere?

39:45.633 --> 39:48.477
Go to the window. Pick a star. Any star.

40:01.691 --> 40:03.910
- How long did you wait?
- Five and half hours.

40:03.985 --> 40:06.113
Great! Always wait five and half hours.

40:06.195 --> 40:07.321
Where've you been?

40:07.405 --> 40:10.454
Explain later. Into the Tardis.
With you in a sec!

40:10.533 --> 40:11.910
Reinette.

40:13.661 --> 40:15.538
Are you there, Reinette?

40:27.508 --> 40:28.851
Reinette?

40:30.678 --> 40:32.351
Oh, hello.

40:33.640 --> 40:35.517
You just missed her.

40:36.517 --> 40:39.396
- She'll be in Paris by 6:00.
- Oh.

40:42.690 --> 40:44.067
Good Lord!

40:45.276 --> 40:46.869
She was right.

40:47.862 --> 40:50.661
She said you never looked a day older.

40:51.282 --> 40:55.753
So many years since I saw you last,
but not a day of it on your face.

41:06.881 --> 41:09.134
She spoke of you many times.

41:10.969 --> 41:13.392
Often wished you'd visit again.

41:14.138 --> 41:16.106
You know how women are.

41:29.153 --> 41:30.951
And there she goes.

41:31.656 --> 41:34.409
Leaving Versailles for the last time.

41:36.244 --> 41:38.167
Only 43 when she died.

41:39.914 --> 41:41.336
Too young-

41:42.667 --> 41:44.089
Too young-

41:45.920 --> 41:48.218
Illness took her in the end.

41:49.382 --> 41:51.760
She always did work too hard.

41:58.307 --> 42:00.059
What does she say?

42:10.695 --> 42:12.117
Of course.

42:13.489 --> 42:14.957
Quite right.

42:34.510 --> 42:36.103
Why her?

42:37.346 --> 42:39.348
Why did they think
they could repair the ship

42:39.432 --> 42:41.730
with the head of Madame de Pompadour?

42:41.809 --> 42:43.937
We'll probably never know.

42:44.020 --> 42:46.364
There's massive damage
in the computer memory decks.

42:46.439 --> 42:48.692
Probably got confused.

42:48.775 --> 42:51.028
The Tardis can close down
the time windows

42:51.152 --> 42:53.405
now the droids have gone.

42:53.488 --> 42:56.458
Should stop it causing any more trouble.

42:59.994 --> 43:01.496
You all right?

43:02.705 --> 43:04.628
I'm always all right.

43:10.671 --> 43:15.017
Come on, Rose, it's time you showed me
round the rest of this place.

43:34.695 --> 43:37.824
My dear Doctor,

43:37.907 --> 43:42.629
the path has never seemed more slow
and yet I fear am nearing its end.

43:43.579 --> 43:47.254
Reason tells me that you and I
are unlikely to meet again,

43:47.375 --> 43:50.345
but I think I shall not listen to reason.

43:50.503 --> 43:55.430
I have seen the world inside your head
and know that all things are possible.

43:56.050 --> 43:58.303
Hurry, though, my love.

43:58.386 --> 44:01.560
My days grow shorter now
and I am so very weak.

44:02.473 --> 44:04.771
Godspeed, my lonely angel.

45:13.586 --> 45:14.803
So this is London.

45:14.879 --> 45:16.722
An alternative to our world
where everything's the same

45:16.797 --> 45:18.299
but a little bit different.

45:18.382 --> 45:20.726
We're in some sort of no place.

45:20.801 --> 45:23.600
All those people
disappearing off the streets,

45:23.679 --> 45:25.431
it's been going on for months.

45:26.849 --> 45:29.568
- What are they all doing?
- It's the earpieces.

45:30.603 --> 45:33.447
The prototype
has passed every test, sir.

45:33.522 --> 45:35.320
It's working.

45:35.399 --> 45:37.322
I've seen them before.

45:37.401 --> 45:39.119
What are they?

45:39.195 --> 45:43.575
Skin of metal and
a body that will never age.

45:43.658 --> 45:44.830
Cybers.
