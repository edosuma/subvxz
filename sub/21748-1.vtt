WEBVTT

00:06.256 --> 00:08.633
[man] So you said let's do the show
about the horse,

00:08.717 --> 00:11.010
-but this time without the horse.
-[woman] I know, I'm sorry.

00:11.094 --> 00:13.054
[man] And I said,
"That's a terrible idea."

00:13.138 --> 00:15.598
And you said, "I got someone
even better." I got...

00:15.682 --> 00:19.352
-What's this asshole's name again?
-Vincent D'Onofrio.

00:19.436 --> 00:22.021
-And here we are.
-[director] Okay. Action!

00:23.440 --> 00:26.317
Hey, Zoe. Hey, Zelda.

00:26.401 --> 00:29.779
-I forgot my boombox.
-And your deodorant.

00:29.863 --> 00:31.823
-Pee-yew, mister.
-[audience laughs]

00:31.906 --> 00:35.285
-Zoe, that's no way to get adopted.
-Adopted, by me?

00:35.368 --> 00:37.620
Children, I'm a single
breakdancing instructor

00:37.704 --> 00:39.456
who can barely take care of himself.

00:39.539 --> 00:43.126
Plus, I'm too rad to be a dad.

00:43.209 --> 00:44.836
[rhythmic grunting] Ooh!

00:44.919 --> 00:47.130
And shake it up. Hah!

00:47.213 --> 00:48.798
-[man coughs]
-Cut!

00:48.882 --> 00:49.758
[klaxon blares]

00:49.841 --> 00:53.928
It's fine, Katrina. If I didn't randomly
wander into doors all the time,

00:54.012 --> 00:56.556
I never would have ended up
co-piloting the very plane

00:56.639 --> 00:58.099
that brought me to Los Angeles.

00:58.183 --> 01:01.644
Excuse me, didn't you see
the flashing red light outside the door?

01:01.728 --> 01:04.105
Of course. That's why I stopped...

01:04.189 --> 01:06.024
what I was doing to come inside.

01:06.107 --> 01:07.108
[laughing]

01:07.192 --> 01:10.487
Ooh, are you filming a sitcom?
I love sitcoms!

01:10.570 --> 01:12.947
You should have a character say,
"Talk to the hand."

01:13.031 --> 01:13.865
[laughter]

01:13.948 --> 01:16.534
The hand! Not the face,
where the ears are.

01:16.618 --> 01:18.578
-Newsflash: hands can't hear.
-[laughter and applause]

01:18.661 --> 01:21.414
What do you mean the character
needs to be more likable?

01:21.498 --> 01:24.250
They don't teach likability
at the American Stanislavski Theatre.

01:24.334 --> 01:25.877
Look, this is not about your acting.

01:25.960 --> 01:28.171
You don't want an actor,
you want a blank canvas

01:28.254 --> 01:32.425
upon which to project your own
mawkish notions of goodness.

01:32.509 --> 01:35.345
Some man for all seasons
up for a bit of anything--

01:35.428 --> 01:37.680
cheerful, optimistic, indomitable.

01:37.764 --> 01:40.809
I assure you no such man exists.

01:40.892 --> 01:43.019
But you're welcome to keep looking.

01:43.102 --> 01:45.730
This D'Onofrio has had enoughfrio.

01:45.814 --> 01:46.898
-Hah hah!
-Hmm.

01:46.981 --> 01:49.317
But my favorite scenes
are when a character

01:49.400 --> 01:52.946
is completely oblivious to something
really important going on behind him.

01:53.029 --> 01:56.491
That, dear friends, is where the sit
truly hits the com.

01:56.574 --> 01:58.451
-Excuse me.
-Kind of in the middle of something.

01:58.535 --> 02:00.703
-He's yakking away, tension's building...
-Hey, you, sir.

02:00.787 --> 02:02.497
...the audience is like,
"Hey, turn around."

02:02.580 --> 02:04.499
Maybe the person behind him
even interrupts him--

02:04.582 --> 02:06.626
-Can we talk to you for a second?
-Just like that.

02:06.709 --> 02:10.380
And then, when it would be ridiculous
to go on even one second longer...

02:10.463 --> 02:12.298
-My name is David Chase.
-Do you mind?

02:12.382 --> 02:15.051
Only then does he say,
exasperated,

02:15.135 --> 02:17.095
"What? What do you want?"

02:17.178 --> 02:20.849
I want your face on billboards,
you beautiful nonsensical clown prince.

02:20.932 --> 02:23.977
-Doggie-doggie what now?
-[laughter and applause]

02:24.060 --> 02:29.190
Kid, how'd you like to be the star of
"Untitled <i>Horsin' Around</i> Knockoff"?

02:29.274 --> 02:33.653
Me, a star? But I have
no experience, no formal training.

02:33.736 --> 02:36.698
Hey, you, you don't need
any of those things.

02:36.781 --> 02:38.950
You got "it."

02:39.033 --> 02:41.286
Ohh...

02:41.369 --> 02:43.371
[theme music playing]

03:37.383 --> 03:40.303
[Diane] <i>Hey, BoJack, it's me again.</i>

03:40.386 --> 03:42.472
[yawns] Hmm?
[groans]

03:42.555 --> 03:44.807
<i>I haven't heard from you</i>
<i>in, like, three months,</i>

03:44.891 --> 03:48.853
<i>so I'm calling again</i>
<i>to make sure you're okay.</i>

03:48.937 --> 03:49.979
[overlapping chatter]

03:50.063 --> 03:51.397
<i>What's new with me?</i>

03:51.481 --> 03:52.440
<i>Well...</i>

03:52.523 --> 03:56.778
Monocle? No, I think
you're thinking of Mr. Peanut.

03:56.861 --> 03:58.029
[Diane] <i>I don't know if you heard</i>

03:58.112 --> 04:00.698
<i>but Mr. Peanutbutter</i>
<i>is running for governor, kind of.</i>

04:00.782 --> 04:04.244
I want a comprehensive crisscross
of cold calls to Contra Costa County.

04:04.327 --> 04:06.162
I mean, Christ, people, get me signatures.

04:06.246 --> 04:09.249
<i>First, they need to get Woodchuck</i>
<i>Coodchuck-Berkowitz recalled,</i>

04:09.332 --> 04:11.251
<i>which is basically impossible.</i>

04:11.334 --> 04:13.836
<i>So that actually makes it really easy</i>
<i>for me to be supportive.</i>

04:13.920 --> 04:15.171
-[smooching]
-[chuckles]

04:15.255 --> 04:17.590
-How's the recall effort?
-Stupendous!

04:17.674 --> 04:21.344
Uh, no. We're about 4,000 signatures shy
of stupendous,

04:21.427 --> 04:22.845
and the deadline's in a week.

04:22.929 --> 04:25.932
Even if you don't get all the signatures,
I'll still be proud of you.

04:26.015 --> 04:26.891
Maybe even more so.

04:26.975 --> 04:28.977
But when we do get
the signatures we need--

04:29.060 --> 04:31.312
-please note I said "when," not "if"...
-Noted.

04:31.396 --> 04:34.941
...then the campaign will begin in...
oh, where did you say again, Katrina?

04:35.024 --> 04:38.444
Earnest. When we get the signatures,
the campaign will begin in earnest.

04:38.528 --> 04:40.613
Right. Earnest, California.

04:40.697 --> 04:43.658
Earnest is not a city in Cal--
Why do I try?

04:43.741 --> 04:45.702
Looks like you two
have everything worked out.

04:45.785 --> 04:48.162
Just please note
that I am being supportive.

04:48.246 --> 04:49.080
Noted!

04:49.163 --> 04:51.249
[Diane] <i>Most women wouldn't like</i>
<i>having their husband's ex-wife</i>

04:51.332 --> 04:53.876
<i>hanging around all the time,</i>
<i>but I'm totally cool with it</i>

04:53.960 --> 04:56.170
<i>because she makes me look</i>
<i>super chill by comparison.</i>

04:56.254 --> 04:57.922
Oh, uh-- okay.

04:58.006 --> 05:00.008
Anyway, call me back.

05:00.091 --> 05:03.553
This is Diane, by the way.
Nguyen, obviously.

05:06.055 --> 05:08.057
You sure you wouldn't rather
just play a governor

05:08.141 --> 05:09.809
in a movie or TV show?

05:09.892 --> 05:11.728
I could attach Tommy Schlamme
to direct.

05:11.811 --> 05:14.272
Tommy Schlamme, shmommy Schlamme.

05:14.355 --> 05:16.399
This is bigger than all that.
Don't you recall?

05:16.482 --> 05:19.152
-Recall what?
-The governor. We need signatures.

05:19.235 --> 05:21.612
Oh, sure.
Where do you stand on the issues?

05:21.696 --> 05:25.825
Oh, he doesn't stand anywhere on issues
because he's not running for governor yet.

05:25.908 --> 05:29.245
I'm mainly for people right now
and also for the future.

05:29.329 --> 05:32.206
[groans]
Listen, I'm not feeling so hot.

05:32.290 --> 05:34.667
Why don't you go get
signatures downstairs.

05:34.751 --> 05:37.754
Jennifer Garner's in the lobby.
She'll sign on to anything.

05:37.837 --> 05:40.089
Judah! Can I get your John Wilkes Hancock?

05:40.173 --> 05:43.342
Oh, I never developed a signature.
I find them unnecessarily ostentatious.

05:43.426 --> 05:45.303
But I can print my name legibly.

05:45.386 --> 05:47.805
Thank you, Rain Man-bun.
That'll do nicely.

05:47.889 --> 05:50.600
-Okay.
-[groaning]

05:50.683 --> 05:51.893
Ralph dropped this off for you.

05:51.976 --> 05:57.482
"I always make a beeline
to see my feline." Aww!

05:57.565 --> 06:01.569
Also, you wanted me to remind you about
FX's <i>American Dead Girl</i> miniseries.

06:01.652 --> 06:04.947
Oh, that's right! What train wreck
are we rubbernecking at this year?

06:05.031 --> 06:06.866
They're doing the Sarah Lynn story

06:06.949 --> 06:09.702
and they're looking
for someone to play BoJack.

06:09.786 --> 06:12.872
Oh! [retching, coughing]

06:12.955 --> 06:15.375
Well, as I was saying, FX is looking
for a BoJack Horseman--

06:15.458 --> 06:17.335
[retching, clearing throat] Ugh!

06:17.418 --> 06:19.504
-Horseman-- Ho--
-[retching]

06:19.587 --> 06:22.215
-[moaning]
-So, as we discussed earlier,

06:22.298 --> 06:24.801
is this one of the moments
where you would want privacy?

06:27.220 --> 06:30.223
You know what I'd do
if I had eight million dollars?

06:30.306 --> 06:32.433
-Yeah, you'd give it to the waitress.
-Oh, no, no, no.

06:32.517 --> 06:34.977
I mean, if I had
eight million dollars now,

06:35.061 --> 06:38.648
I'd start a company that makes
remote-controlled drones.

06:38.731 --> 06:42.068
But these drones have a seat
hanging from the bottom

06:42.151 --> 06:43.903
so you can fly around in it.

06:43.986 --> 06:47.657
A drone with a throne.
A drone throne.

06:47.740 --> 06:50.409
But if you're in it, isn't it not a drone?

06:50.493 --> 06:53.329
I feel like you're getting
really hung up on labels.

06:53.413 --> 06:55.164
Well, anyways,
with my eight million dollars

06:55.248 --> 06:58.668
I'm starting a new dating app
just for firemen

06:58.751 --> 07:00.586
and redheaded women named Emily.

07:00.670 --> 07:03.339
Aww, you don't need an app,
just hang out with me.

07:03.422 --> 07:05.091
Todd, you're great.

07:05.174 --> 07:06.717
What a way to end a sentence.

07:06.801 --> 07:10.388
But I want a boyfriend who isn't asexual.

07:10.471 --> 07:12.306
Whoa. Why did you call me that?

07:12.390 --> 07:14.809
No, no, it's not bad.
I didn't mean it negatively.

07:14.892 --> 07:18.438
-I was just, like, stating it.
-I'm not-- that word doesn't describe--

07:18.521 --> 07:20.982
Okay, okay, I'm sorry,
whatever you call yourself,

07:21.065 --> 07:22.984
you're my friend and I support you.

07:23.067 --> 07:26.195
But sometimes labels can be helpful.

07:26.279 --> 07:30.616
Wow. Well, I would label
this conversation "rough".

07:30.700 --> 07:32.368
Here's the check.

07:32.452 --> 07:35.580
And this cow likes getting tipped.

07:38.166 --> 07:41.294
[Diane] <i>Hey, BoJack, it's me again,</i>
<i>voicemail number 17.</i>

07:41.377 --> 07:43.045
<i>Did I tell you I'm working at a blog?</i>

07:43.129 --> 07:45.423
<i>I wrote a story about</i>
<i>an all-girl refugee kickball league.</i>

07:45.506 --> 07:48.176
<i>It didn't get as many clicks as Gillian's</i>
<i>story about how in certain pictures</i>

07:48.259 --> 07:50.094

<i>but, you know, we're all contributing</i>
<i>in our own ways.</i>

07:52.805 --> 07:55.725
Anyway, it's weird not having you around.

07:55.808 --> 07:58.769
I hope you're okay, wherever you are.

with my favorite little adult cat."

08:07.361 --> 08:08.654
Oh! I love it.

08:08.738 --> 08:10.114
I'm sorry I couldn't make it

08:10.198 --> 08:13.159
to the <i>Paul Blart 3: Till Death</i>
<i>Do Us Blart</i> premiere last night.

08:13.242 --> 08:14.494
I had a doctor's appointment.

08:14.577 --> 08:17.121
-Whoa. Is everything okay?
-Yeah, yeah, it's fine.

08:17.205 --> 08:20.291
I don't like not knowing where you are,
especially when we live three freeways

08:20.374 --> 08:22.376
and an unprotected left turn
away from each other.

08:22.460 --> 08:25.379
I was thinking, what if you move
somewhere closer to me,

08:25.463 --> 08:26.964
like into my house?

08:27.048 --> 08:28.674
Oh. [stammers] Wow!

08:28.758 --> 08:30.927
Would you, could you, with a mouse?

08:31.010 --> 08:34.555
I-- I could, and I would,
but it's not a good time.

08:34.639 --> 08:35.848
Oh, okay.

08:35.932 --> 08:38.392
-I'm sorry.
-No, no, it's fine. There's no hurry.

08:38.476 --> 08:41.020
-We're still young, right?
-Oh, yeah, I'm super young.

08:41.103 --> 08:43.606
Blake Lively accidentally
called me Mommy yesterday,

08:43.689 --> 08:47.026
but I'm sure she does that
to other young women all the time.

09:04.877 --> 09:06.212
Whoa, whoa!

09:06.295 --> 09:08.339
Okay, Todd. Whoa!

09:08.422 --> 09:10.007
Oh, God, today's the day.

09:10.091 --> 09:12.260
I haven't been this nervous
since Diane was vacuuming

09:12.343 --> 09:13.844
during a thunderstorm
on the Fourth of July,

09:13.928 --> 09:16.138
I had to take a bath,
and there was a stranger in our yard.

09:16.222 --> 09:18.808
There's no need to be nervous,
or calm for that matter

09:18.891 --> 09:20.059
because you've already lost.

09:20.142 --> 09:23.437
We're 1,600 signatures short
and the clock runs out at 9:00 AM.

09:23.521 --> 09:25.398
So it's gonna take a miracle, huh?

09:25.481 --> 09:26.816
[buzzer blaring]

09:26.899 --> 09:28.442
Oh, no! It's over.

09:28.526 --> 09:31.195
Everyone can get out of my house now.

09:31.279 --> 09:33.489
Ooh, tough break, kid.
We're all in shock.

09:33.573 --> 09:35.741
McG! Are you still looking for a star

09:35.825 --> 09:38.953
for your transgender Teddy Roosevelt
<i>Planes, Trains and Automobiles</i> reboot,

09:39.036 --> 09:40.997
<i>Plans, Trans, A Man, A Canal, Panama?</i>

09:41.080 --> 09:42.873
Because someone just became available.

09:42.957 --> 09:44.250
Whoa! Whoa!

09:44.333 --> 09:46.252
I don't understand what happened.

09:46.335 --> 09:49.547
Let me put it in terms
your dumb dog brain can comprehend.

09:49.630 --> 09:52.717
All your life people have been
throwing you bones

09:52.800 --> 09:54.010
because they like you,

09:54.093 --> 09:56.429
but everyone has a ceiling
to their likability.

09:56.512 --> 10:01.475
This is a bone you can't have,
because people just don't like you enough.

10:03.311 --> 10:06.105
-I'm sorry, Mr. Peanutbutter.
-You know, it's funny.

10:06.188 --> 10:09.233
Personally I like Woodchuck
and he's a fine governor,

10:09.317 --> 10:12.445
but for some reason, even though
I have zero qualifications,

10:12.528 --> 10:14.947
I honestly thought I would have made
an even better governor.

10:15.031 --> 10:18.576
-Well, what matters is you tried.
-But I would have been good, right?

10:18.659 --> 10:21.370
Now that there's no chance
you will ever be governor,

10:21.454 --> 10:23.080
I can tell you honestly...

10:23.664 --> 10:25.958
-Yes. You would have been great.
-[chuckles]

10:26.042 --> 10:28.586
Stop. But seriously, though, elaborate.

10:28.669 --> 10:31.589
You care about people,
you follow your heart.

10:31.672 --> 10:33.966
Those are important qualities
you should never give up on.

10:34.050 --> 10:36.135
So what you're saying is
I shouldn't give up?

10:36.218 --> 10:38.804
-On those qualities.
-Yeah. Never concede.

10:38.888 --> 10:40.931
-Stick it out, stay in the race.
-Uh-- no--

10:41.015 --> 10:43.309
Uh, maybe we should get
Katrina's two cents on this.

10:43.392 --> 10:45.478
-Katrina?
-Race. That's it, Diane!

10:45.561 --> 10:47.313
You diabolical Thin Mint.

10:47.396 --> 10:52.068
You, and only you, are responsible
for the great thing I am about to do.

10:52.735 --> 10:54.612
Katrina?

10:54.695 --> 10:57.531
-[applause]
-[deep breath]

10:57.615 --> 10:58.658
Thank you, thank you.

10:58.741 --> 11:02.620
Moments ago I found myself
in what seemed to be a no-win situation.

11:02.703 --> 11:05.915
But it turns out
it was a "Nguyen situation."

11:05.998 --> 11:09.210
I'm referring of course
to my supportive wife Diane Nguyen,

11:09.293 --> 11:12.254
-who told me to never give up!
-[groans]

11:12.338 --> 11:16.133
And that's why I am challenging
Woodchuck Coodchuck-Berkowitz

11:16.217 --> 11:19.136
-to a ski race down Devil's Mountain.
-What?

11:19.220 --> 11:21.722
No more petitions
or fancy ballot initiatives,

11:21.806 --> 11:25.434
just a mano a mano,
no-holds-barred slippery slalom

11:25.518 --> 11:26.685
down an ice-covered peak.

11:26.769 --> 11:29.480
Winner gets to be governor,
loser goes home.

11:29.563 --> 11:31.524
Your move, Governor.
Mic drop!

11:31.607 --> 11:33.317
-[feedback squeal]
-[cheers and applause]

11:33.401 --> 11:35.778
-Aaah!
-[cheering]

11:35.861 --> 11:37.905
[Woodchuck]
What the hell is he talking about?

11:37.988 --> 11:41.617
It sounds like he's challenging you
to a ski race down Devil's Mountain.

11:41.700 --> 11:44.578
What an absurd conceit.
Do I even need to respond to this?

11:44.662 --> 11:45.496
No, sir.

11:45.579 --> 11:48.958
Because I'd rather focus
on my drought relief optimization

11:49.041 --> 11:53.587
using geohydration technology,
or DROUGHT plan.

11:53.671 --> 11:57.299
If I know anything, this story
will go away in a couple of days.

11:58.717 --> 12:02.972
Now Mr. Peanutbutter, you challenged
Woodchuck to a ski race a month ago.

12:03.055 --> 12:05.933
Not just any ski race, a high-stakes dash
down Devil's Mountain

12:06.016 --> 12:08.936
-for the governorship itself.
-But still no comment from the governor.

12:09.019 --> 12:11.897
Why won't he race you?
That's what I want to know.

12:11.981 --> 12:13.482
You and me both, friendo.

12:13.566 --> 12:17.236
But this isn't an us-ocracy,
it's a dem-ocracy.

12:17.319 --> 12:19.822
-[audience] Ooh!
-So let's ask "dem" what "dey" think.

12:19.905 --> 12:22.616
-[cheers and applause]
-Any questions for the governor, folks?

12:22.700 --> 12:25.703
[audience chants]
Why won't Woodchuck race?

12:25.786 --> 12:30.332
So, to be clear, my DROUGHT plan
is actually a drought relief plan.

12:30.416 --> 12:33.043
I see now how that's confusing.
Any other questions?

12:33.127 --> 12:34.879
Are you going to race Mr. Peanutbutter?

12:34.962 --> 12:37.715
Any questions about the DROUGHT plan?

12:38.716 --> 12:40.426
To ski or not to ski?

12:40.509 --> 12:42.928
That was the question
posed by William Shakespeare

12:43.012 --> 12:45.347
and it's perhaps even more relevant today.

12:45.431 --> 12:48.809
Of course, there <i>are </i>reasons
why a gubernatorial election

12:48.893 --> 12:50.561
should not be decided by a ski race,

12:50.644 --> 12:53.022
but are there also reasons
why it should?

12:53.105 --> 12:54.732
For the sake of "fairness"

12:54.815 --> 12:57.318
we've brought in two experts
with opposite opinions

12:57.401 --> 12:59.820
who will now have equal time
to just say those opinions

12:59.904 --> 13:02.281
because that's what news is.

13:02.364 --> 13:04.783
You think they'll really race
down Devil's Mountain?

13:04.867 --> 13:08.329
What do I care? As long as I've got
my giant bag of kettle corn,

13:08.412 --> 13:10.372
that's the only thing that concerns me.

13:10.456 --> 13:11.499
-[Todd grunts]
-[gasps]

13:11.582 --> 13:14.668
-What the?
-Drone Throne strikes again! Ha ha!

13:14.752 --> 13:16.170
Get back here with my kettle corn!

13:16.253 --> 13:18.839
You can't call it a drone
if you're riding on it.

13:18.923 --> 13:20.716
Suckers! Hooray!

13:20.799 --> 13:22.176
Ha ha! Oh-- oh, no!

13:23.302 --> 13:24.720
Aw, man.

13:24.803 --> 13:27.348
I was hoisted by my own petard,

13:27.431 --> 13:31.185
the one petard I thought
would never hoist me.

13:31.894 --> 13:33.812
[Woodchuck] Unprecedented poppycock.

13:33.896 --> 13:35.773
This poppycock has no precedent.

13:35.856 --> 13:38.734
Maybe it's time to make a statement.

13:38.817 --> 13:39.985
Madeline, no.

13:40.069 --> 13:42.696
This outlandish buffoonery
is beneath the office of the governor.

13:42.780 --> 13:45.407
I can't defile the legacy
of my predecessors

13:45.491 --> 13:48.661
who built the Golden Gate Bridge,
irrigated the Central Valley,

13:48.744 --> 13:50.955
and played Mr. Freeze in a Batman movie.

13:51.038 --> 13:54.416
Can't you see this thing
is eating you alive?

13:54.500 --> 13:58.212
Do it for us, Woodcharles.
Do it for us.

13:58.295 --> 13:59.380
[groans]

14:00.089 --> 14:05.970
And so this ski race would be both
undemocratic and unconstitutional,

14:06.053 --> 14:10.891
which is why I will not be racing
Mr. Peanutbutter down Devil's Mountain.

14:10.975 --> 14:13.769
What if the state constitution
were changed to allow it?

14:13.852 --> 14:17.231
-Then would you race Mr. Peanutbutter?
-I... [sighs]

14:17.314 --> 14:20.651
Fine. If a state senator
wanted to waste everybody's time

14:20.734 --> 14:23.362
by sponsoring an amendment
to the constitution,

14:23.445 --> 14:25.948
and the motion got two-thirds majority
in both houses

14:26.031 --> 14:29.535
so as to allow
a democratically-elected governor

14:29.618 --> 14:32.705
to accept a ski race challenge
for his office,

14:32.788 --> 14:36.458
then yes, I would race Mr. Peanutbutter.

14:36.542 --> 14:38.460
Well, I guess that puts
that idea to bed, right?

14:38.544 --> 14:40.588
-Hmm.
-Right?

14:40.671 --> 14:42.923
-Hmm... [chuckles]
-Right?!

14:46.886 --> 14:50.931
You want me to sponsor a ski race
amendment to the constitution?

14:51.015 --> 14:53.934
Or you could sponsor the amendment
that has a hidden rider

14:54.018 --> 14:56.562
doubling farm subsidies in your district.

14:56.645 --> 15:00.024
-Inglewood could use some farms.
-That's right.

15:00.107 --> 15:02.902
I do have these campaign donors--
uh, I mean, constituents

15:02.985 --> 15:05.654
who really care about babies' access
to vaping devices.

15:05.738 --> 15:07.489
-[coughing]
-Uh-huh.

15:07.573 --> 15:11.035
I've always wanted to drive across
a bridge to Hawaii.

15:11.118 --> 15:13.037
-Can we do that?
-You got it.

15:13.120 --> 15:14.538
Aloha! [giggles]

15:14.622 --> 15:16.832
Hoo hoo hoo hoo! Whoo!

15:17.499 --> 15:20.252
[chuckles] It tickles.

15:21.754 --> 15:23.672
[sighs]

15:23.756 --> 15:27.092
I'm astounded that it has come to this.

15:27.176 --> 15:29.678
But since the exorbitantly expensive

15:29.762 --> 15:34.642
and astonishingly titled I Love California
amendment is now law,

15:34.725 --> 15:38.646
I formally accept Mr. Peanutbutter's
challenge to a ski race.

15:38.729 --> 15:40.397
It happens that I'm an excellent skier

15:40.481 --> 15:43.150
who won numerous medals in the sport
when I raced for Dartmouth

15:43.233 --> 15:45.653
but, again, I am shocked
that fact is relevant

15:45.736 --> 15:48.238
in the matter of selecting
our state's governor.

15:48.322 --> 15:53.452
Mr. Peanutbutter, I will see you
on Devil's Mountain.

15:54.370 --> 15:55.996
-Whoa!
-This is insane.

15:56.080 --> 15:58.874
You could actually become governor
by winning a race.

15:58.958 --> 16:00.292
Yeah. Wow.

16:00.376 --> 16:03.170
You know, it's days like this
I wish I knew how to ski.

16:04.338 --> 16:07.383
-You don't ski?
-Never really got into it, no.

16:07.466 --> 16:11.553
Then why did you challenge the governor
to a ski race?

16:11.637 --> 16:13.347
[chuckles] I didn't think
it would get this far.

16:13.430 --> 16:15.474
You gotta admit, this is pretty out there.

16:15.557 --> 16:18.394
Well, I guess that's it. Oh, well.
Tough break. Bye forever, Katrina.

16:18.477 --> 16:21.689
No, this is not over.
This is just beginning.

16:21.772 --> 16:25.317
Mr. Peanutbutter,
you're going to ski school.

16:25.401 --> 16:27.611
Doggie-doggie what now?

16:27.695 --> 16:29.780
[Diane] <i>Hey, BoJack, it's me again.</i>

16:29.863 --> 16:30.990
<i>Where are you, I'm worried,</i>

16:31.073 --> 16:32.616
<i>hope you're not dead,</i>
<i>etc... you get it.</i>

16:32.700 --> 16:35.953
<i>Anyway, things are even crazier</i>
<i>around here lately.</i>

16:36.036 --> 16:39.415
<i>Don't know if you've seen the news,</i>
<i>but I really wish you were here for this.</i>

16:39.498 --> 16:42.459
Well, I'm off to ski school
so I can learn how to ski,

16:42.543 --> 16:43.961
so I can become the governor.

16:44.044 --> 16:45.421
[Diane] Y<i>ou'd say something like,</i>

16:45.504 --> 16:47.506
<i>"That's the dumbest thing</i>
<i>I've ever heard."</i>

16:47.589 --> 16:49.258
Sounds great, sweetheart.

16:49.341 --> 16:51.969
But as the old saying goes,
that's politics.

16:52.052 --> 16:54.638
[Diane] <i>Then you'd probably say,</i>
<i>"A, that's not an old saying</i>

16:54.722 --> 16:58.183
<i>and, B, that's not politics!</i>
<i>Nothing about that is politics."</i>

16:58.267 --> 17:00.102
This is so great!

17:00.185 --> 17:01.603
<i>Then you would be so overwhelmed</i>

17:01.687 --> 17:03.772
<i>by the unbearable ludicrousness</i>
<i>of the situation</i>

17:03.856 --> 17:06.108
<i>that you would get in your car</i>
<i>and drive to Hawaii,</i>

17:06.191 --> 17:08.110
<i>which is also a thing you could do now</i>

17:08.193 --> 17:10.904
<i>because of a new bill</i>
<i>that cost our state billions of dollars.</i>

17:10.988 --> 17:12.614
<i>It's all so great!</i>

17:14.533 --> 17:18.579
[sighs] <i>You know, it's funny,</i>
<i>because the last time I saw you</i>

17:18.662 --> 17:21.790
you <i>told </i>me <i>that you needed me</i>
<i>in your life,</i>

17:21.874 --> 17:23.333
<i>and then you just disappeared.</i>

17:23.417 --> 17:25.085
<i>So how do you think</i>
<i>that makes me feel?</i>

17:25.961 --> 17:29.381
<i>Well, wherever you are,</i>
<i>I hope you're happy.</i>

17:29.465 --> 17:31.717
<i>I really do, BoJack.</i>

17:31.800 --> 17:34.511
<i>Also, I haven't seen Todd in a while.</i>
<i>He's not with you, is he?</i>

17:36.472 --> 17:38.057
[munching]

17:38.140 --> 17:40.017
Oh, simple kettle corn.

17:40.100 --> 17:44.063
Between the worlds of the sweet
and the savory.

17:44.146 --> 17:47.858
Not quite popcorn, not quite candy.

17:47.941 --> 17:50.402
-What are we?
-[cawing]

17:50.486 --> 17:52.446
Hey, get away! Get, get!

17:52.529 --> 17:53.781
[gasping, choking]

17:57.326 --> 17:59.703
Wow, my first day at ski academy.

17:59.787 --> 18:02.122
What collegiate shenanigans
will befall me?

18:02.206 --> 18:05.542
There will be no shenanigans
on my watch.

18:05.626 --> 18:06.877
Professor Thistlethorpe,

18:06.960 --> 18:09.838
the famously humorless yet somehow
also lovable ski instructor?

18:09.922 --> 18:13.592
Peanutbutter, is it?
Everything about you disgusts me.

18:13.675 --> 18:14.510
Uh...

18:14.593 --> 18:18.555
And yet, there might be
something in you after all.

18:18.639 --> 18:19.890
You really mean it?

18:19.973 --> 18:22.643
This shall be my greatest challenge.

18:22.726 --> 18:25.270
Meet me on the summit
tomorrow at daybreak.

18:25.354 --> 18:27.981
Well, it is daybreak
and here we are at the summit.

18:28.065 --> 18:30.901
First lesson, break your skis in half.

18:30.984 --> 18:33.320
Oh, I don't have skis.
Was I supposed to bring skis?

18:33.403 --> 18:36.240
-You didn't say that.
-No bother. They shan't be required.

18:36.323 --> 18:39.451
Instead, read this book of poetry.

18:39.535 --> 18:42.204
I'll see you in the classroom.

18:42.955 --> 18:45.833
Ah, there you are.
Did you read the book of poetry?

18:45.916 --> 18:47.626
No! I forgot to.

18:47.709 --> 18:49.753
-Excellent.
-I'm sor-- Excellent?

18:49.837 --> 18:51.630
My assignment was a test.

18:51.713 --> 18:54.091
Skiing isn't about reading old books.

18:54.174 --> 18:56.718
-It's about speaking truth to power...
-Oh!

18:56.802 --> 18:59.304
...and you have spoken it eloquently.

18:59.388 --> 19:02.349
You are my finest student.

19:02.432 --> 19:04.268
I love you.

19:04.351 --> 19:05.561
[coughing]

19:05.644 --> 19:07.896
-Are you okay, professor?
-Just a cough.

19:07.980 --> 19:11.441
I'm sure it's nothing. You can come by
tomorrow for your diploma.

19:13.443 --> 19:16.280
I can't believe ski school
is already over.

19:16.363 --> 19:18.699
Professor Thistlethorpe?
Professor Thistlethorpe!

19:18.782 --> 19:22.911
[weakly] Remember everything
I taught you.

19:22.995 --> 19:23.996
I will.

19:24.079 --> 19:27.040
Also, if you have any tips for skiing,
that would be really helpful.

19:27.124 --> 19:30.627
The most important part of skiing

19:30.711 --> 19:35.299
is to keep your legs ben...

19:36.675 --> 19:39.052
[sobbing]

19:39.761 --> 19:41.346
Who's Ben?

19:53.525 --> 19:56.695
Devil's Mountain is the place,
skiing is the sport.

19:56.778 --> 19:58.864
I'm uncomfortable.
It's cold out.

19:58.947 --> 20:01.325
Tell me, who do you think
will win today's bout

20:01.408 --> 20:03.327
and what does it mean
for the future of California?

20:03.410 --> 20:04.870
I hate winter sports.

20:04.953 --> 20:07.122
I want to go inside and drink a cider.

20:07.206 --> 20:08.790
-[starter's pistol firing]
-And they're off!

20:08.874 --> 20:11.251
[grunts, yelling]

20:12.336 --> 20:14.087
[Tom] Woodchuck, off to a great start.

20:14.171 --> 20:16.548
Mr. Peanutbutter seems to be employing

20:16.632 --> 20:19.968
some sort of awkwardly
falling down technique.

20:20.052 --> 20:22.721
-Any sign of them?
-Nothing yet.

20:22.804 --> 20:25.265
-Oh! I made you a card.
-You did?

20:25.349 --> 20:27.809
[chuckles] Oh, wow, it's sparkly.

20:27.893 --> 20:29.895
Sorry, I went a little overboard
with the glitter

20:29.978 --> 20:31.563
and a little underboard with the glue.

20:31.647 --> 20:34.691
[Ralph] "Let's move in together.
I think I'm ready now."

20:34.775 --> 20:36.944
This is great.
Are you sure, though,

20:37.027 --> 20:39.696
because last time you seemed
a little hesitant.

20:39.780 --> 20:42.699
-No, I was just a little pregnant.
-Oh!

20:42.783 --> 20:43.992
I was gonna tell you, really,

20:44.076 --> 20:46.787
but then before I could tell you
there was nothing to tell you.

20:46.870 --> 20:47.996
Oh.

20:48.080 --> 20:52.042
I'm so sorry. I still wish
you would've told me.

20:52.125 --> 20:55.587
I have a card for that. On the front
it says, "Life isn't fairage."

20:55.671 --> 20:59.549
I'm sorry. I just felt dumb
because all my life I've wanted a family.

20:59.633 --> 21:02.511
But I didn't want it to happen
just because I got pregnant by accident

21:02.594 --> 21:04.846
-and then you got stuck with me.
-Okay, first of all,

21:04.930 --> 21:07.683
if I get stuck to something,
you're the prettiest glue trap I ever saw.

21:07.766 --> 21:09.935
-You know what I mean.
-Second, if that's how you feel,

21:10.018 --> 21:12.938
maybe you shouldn't get pregnant
by accident.

21:13.021 --> 21:14.773
-Well, I didn't try to!
-No.

21:14.856 --> 21:17.651
I'm saying maybe we should
get you pregnant on purpose.

21:17.734 --> 21:19.069
-Really?
-Yeah.

21:19.152 --> 21:21.697
We love each other,
and we enjoy having sex with each other--

21:21.780 --> 21:23.573
and we're good
at having sex with each other.

21:23.657 --> 21:26.535
And also, I think you'd be
an amazing mother.

21:26.618 --> 21:29.871
-[sighs]
-Even Blake Lively thinks so.

21:29.955 --> 21:31.915
Ah, still got it.

21:34.668 --> 21:35.669
Yes!

21:35.752 --> 21:36.920
[grunting, yelling]

21:37.004 --> 21:38.338
Whoa! Whoa-ho-ho!

21:40.173 --> 21:42.009
Ohh! Get control.

21:42.092 --> 21:44.720
Woodchuck in the lead,
still in the lead.

21:44.803 --> 21:47.264
Woodchuck remains
very much in the lead.

21:48.098 --> 21:49.891
Goodbye, dear friend.

21:49.975 --> 21:51.810
You served me well.

21:51.893 --> 21:54.396
[gasps] Okay, all right, here we go.

21:55.105 --> 21:56.565
Mr. Peanutbutter?

21:56.648 --> 21:58.775
Ohh! [yelling]

21:59.943 --> 22:02.237
[grunting, gasping]

22:03.363 --> 22:05.073
[yelling]

22:05.157 --> 22:07.534
[gasping]

22:07.617 --> 22:08.910
[panting]

22:08.994 --> 22:10.078
I see Woodchuck!

22:10.162 --> 22:11.580
Yes!

22:11.663 --> 22:14.207
Go, Woodcharles!

22:14.291 --> 22:16.460
Oh... whoa... [grunts] Whoa!

22:16.543 --> 22:17.377
Oh, my God.

22:19.254 --> 22:22.049
Todd forever!

22:22.132 --> 22:23.759
Whaa!

22:23.842 --> 22:26.344
-[crowd gasping]
-Ow, ow, ow, ow! [grunts]

22:27.804 --> 22:30.265
-[crowd cheering]
-Invictus!

22:30.348 --> 22:32.851
-[groaning, grunts]
-Ooh! Ooh.

22:32.934 --> 22:35.729
-[moaning]
-Oh... ohh.

22:35.812 --> 22:37.898
-Did I win?
-Come on, honey.

22:37.981 --> 22:39.316
Let's go home.

22:39.399 --> 22:41.109
-[applause]
-Well, I hope that settles it.

22:41.193 --> 22:44.029
We can finally put an end
to this nonsense.

22:44.112 --> 22:47.657
Sir, the rules are clear: the first person
to cross the finish line becomes governor,

22:47.741 --> 22:50.952
and, well, a strange boy
fell out of the sky

22:51.036 --> 22:52.579
and crossed the line first.

22:52.662 --> 22:54.164
They're swearing him in now.

22:54.247 --> 22:57.876
-So help me Todd.
-Congratulations, Governor Chavez.

22:57.959 --> 22:59.336
[cheers and applause]

22:59.419 --> 23:02.506
You know, ever since
I first became governor

23:02.589 --> 23:04.800
I've thought,
"I don't want to be governor"

23:04.883 --> 23:06.635
and that's where I am now.

23:06.718 --> 23:08.845
So, can I not be governor?

23:08.929 --> 23:09.971
[groaning and gasping]

23:10.055 --> 23:11.306
You'd like to resign?

23:11.389 --> 23:14.226
Yeah. I'm just really not
into labels right now.

23:14.309 --> 23:17.813
Maybe after some soul searching
I'll be ready to really know what I am.

23:17.896 --> 23:21.733
But for right now,
I think I speak for all Californians

23:21.817 --> 23:24.861
when I say, "I ate too much kettle corn

23:24.945 --> 23:29.324
while drifting through the sky
on an out of control drone throne."

23:29.407 --> 23:32.327
Okay, is this charade over?
Can I be governor again?

23:32.410 --> 23:35.163
Sir, we live in a society of laws.

23:35.247 --> 23:38.291
When a governor resigns,
that triggers a special election.

23:38.375 --> 23:41.128
Until which, the governor's seat
shall remain vacant.

23:41.211 --> 23:43.421
-[all gasping]
-Election, you say?

23:43.505 --> 23:45.966
Mr. Peanutbutter, will you run?

23:46.049 --> 23:48.885
-You bet I will, and you know why?
-No, tell me.

23:49.553 --> 23:51.972
Because this whole ski race was a joke.

23:52.055 --> 23:54.975
Of course Woodchuck was gonna beat me.
He went to Dartmouth.

23:55.058 --> 23:57.727
So where's the candidate
for regular schmoes like me,

23:57.811 --> 24:00.313
-who went to Northwestern?
-Is he serious right now?

24:00.397 --> 24:03.024
You know, Governor Woodchuck
Coodchuck-Berkowitz

24:03.108 --> 24:05.902
thinks he's better than us,
but is he better than us?

24:05.986 --> 24:08.071
-[crowd] No!
-Uh, if I could say a few words--

24:08.155 --> 24:09.656
He thinks the race is over.

24:09.739 --> 24:12.367
Well, I say it's just starting.

24:12.450 --> 24:15.787
And he wants me to sit and stay
and roll over?

24:15.871 --> 24:19.541
-No!
-I say California's tired of rolling over.

24:19.624 --> 24:21.585
What do you say?

24:21.668 --> 24:23.211
-[crowd] Yeah!
-[woman] I'm tired.

24:23.295 --> 24:26.464
I say it's time for me
to stand up and speak.

24:26.548 --> 24:28.341
-[cheering]
-Diane-Diane what now?

24:28.425 --> 24:31.136
So loud as you can,
let me hear what you want.

24:31.219 --> 24:34.055
[chanting] Peanutbutter!
Peanutbutter!

24:34.139 --> 24:36.141
-Uh, citizens--
-I can't hear you!

24:36.224 --> 24:39.311
Peanutbutter!
Peanutbutter!

24:39.394 --> 24:40.729
-Peanutbutter!
-[nervous chuckle]

24:40.812 --> 24:43.940
-Peanutbutter!
-Friends, some decorum, please.

24:44.482 --> 24:47.819
-Peanutbutter! Peanutbutter!
-[grunts] Ah! [panting]

24:47.903 --> 24:51.448
Peanutbutter! Peanutbutter!

24:51.531 --> 24:53.491
Peanutbutter!
Peanutbutter!
