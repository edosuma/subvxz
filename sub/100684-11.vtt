39:53.216 --> 39:56.655
It would make me sad
every time I looked at it.

39:59.527 --> 40:01.529
Yeah, I get that.

40:04.314 --> 40:06.316
Okay.

40:20.766 --> 40:22.898
We did a good job.

40:22.942 --> 40:24.900
It's gonna be okay.

40:24.944 --> 40:26.946
Where do we go?

40:29.078 --> 40:31.516
My parents have
a cabin in Aspen.

40:31.559 --> 40:33.692
We can hide out
there for a while.

40:33.735 --> 40:35.955
We can't go anywhereNia's people could find us.

40:35.998 --> 40:38.827
I say we drive as far away
from here as possible

40:38.871 --> 40:40.873
and figure it out
on the road.

40:42.918 --> 40:44.442
I have to go home first.

40:44.485 --> 40:45.747
Oh, good idea.

40:45.791 --> 40:47.749
No one'll be looking
for us there.

40:47.793 --> 40:49.751
I have to get Pretzel.

40:49.795 --> 40:51.797
I'm not leaving without him.

40:56.584 --> 40:58.586
Okay.

40:58.630 --> 41:00.022
[engine starts]

41:10.685 --> 41:13.514
Whoa, hey, hang on.Someone broke in.

41:13.558 --> 41:14.820
What?

41:14.863 --> 41:16.865
Oh, it was me.
I kicked the door in.

41:16.909 --> 41:18.693
You're such an idiot.[laughs]

41:18.737 --> 41:21.870
Well, you wouldn't talk to me,
so what was I supposed to...

41:27.659 --> 41:29.356
What?

41:29.399 --> 41:31.532
JOSIAH:
You...

41:31.576 --> 41:33.534
promised me drugs.

41:37.582 --> 41:39.540
Where are my drugs?
