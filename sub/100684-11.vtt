[laughs]

00:26.896 --> 00:29.290
Oh, my God.What?

00:29.333 --> 00:32.815
We literally didn't leave
the room all day.

Well, I know. Why would we?

00:34.556 --> 00:35.687
[both laugh]

What are you doing?

01:04.151 --> 01:06.762
Oh, I started
my stupid period

01:06.805 --> 01:08.242
and I don't have a tampon,
so I was just seeing

01:08.285 --> 01:11.114
if you have one.

01:11.158 --> 01:12.942
And now I realize
that it looks like

01:12.985 --> 01:15.988
I'm going through
your stuff. Sorry.

01:16.032 --> 01:18.426
Sorry.It's okay. You can go
through my stuff.

01:18.469 --> 01:21.124
I don't think I have one,but you can check.

01:21.168 --> 01:23.039
Okay.

01:25.998 --> 01:28.131
Oh, boy. Okay, you don't.

01:28.175 --> 01:29.437
I'll be right back.

01:29.480 --> 01:31.003
Uh, babe, I don't think

01:31.047 --> 01:33.310
that little market
stays open past, like, 7:00.

01:33.354 --> 01:34.746
Right.

01:34.790 --> 01:38.228
There is a 24-hour grocery store
off the highway,

01:38.272 --> 01:39.577

how did you even get here?

04:11.512 --> 04:13.862
Okay, you need to
listen to me. Um...

04:13.905 --> 04:17.692
Murphy is-is turning on Nia,
and Nia just found out.

And-and we have
to warn her.

How do you...?

How do you know about Nia?

Okay, I really,
I really don't have time

04:29.181 --> 04:30.879

so, Jess, please...

04:30.922 --> 04:35.231
Wait, how-how do you know
about Nia?

04:37.059 --> 04:39.714
I was, um,
I was working for her.

04:39.757 --> 04:44.675
Just, like, keeping tabs
on things, and, um...

04:44.719 --> 04:46.329
That's why I ran
away with you,

04:46.373 --> 04:49.550
so that we could
actually be together.

04:49.593 --> 04:52.988

that was all real.

she was gonna kill her, right?

out of here. Look around.

we're very grateful

Honestly I'm amazed, but, um,I think you should probably go,

10:25.450 --> 10:27.757
because we don't want to ropeyou into this any further, okay?

10:27.801 --> 10:28.932

Okay, yeah,
we're not roping

10:28.976 --> 10:30.804

Jess is the reason.FELIX:Okay, guys,I don't think

10:51.825 --> 10:52.782
this matters right now.

10:52.826 --> 10:53.827
What are we doing?

10:53.870 --> 10:55.524
I'm gonna go
to the police.

10:55.567 --> 10:57.700
I can explain everything.

10:57.744 --> 11:00.529
I'm gonna tell them that
Jess did it to save me.

11:01.748 --> 11:04.576
No. No, no, no.
I don't think the cops

11:04.620 --> 11:06.709
are gonna believe that we were
just innocent in all this.

11:06.753 --> 11:08.537
Dude, we can't
just cover this up.

11:08.580 --> 11:10.191
Well, what do you suggest we do?

11:10.234 --> 11:13.020
I say we just leave the bodies
here and don't say anything.

11:13.063 --> 11:14.935
Okay? Ben's a drug addict.Nia is a drug dealer.

11:14.978 --> 11:16.850
We have Ben's gun here.It would just look like

11:16.893 --> 11:18.547
he robbed Nia and shot her,

11:18.590 --> 11:20.462
then overdosed.STERLING:We can't,

11:20.505 --> 11:22.290
because Murphy's blood is
literally all over the floor.So then we

11:22.333 --> 11:23.900
clean it up.And then there will
be evidence that we were

11:23.944 --> 11:25.859
trying to hide something.Yeah, she's right, she's right.

11:25.902 --> 11:28.122
If you leave the bodies, there'sgonna be an investigation.

11:28.165 --> 11:29.253
If there's an investigation,

11:29.297 --> 11:31.038
they will find out
that we were here.

11:31.081 --> 11:33.083
Well, then we just leave
Ben's body here, just O.D.'d.

11:33.127 --> 11:34.737
That would make sense, right?No!

11:34.781 --> 11:36.608
Why not?Because I don't want Chelsea

11:36.652 --> 11:38.132

and finding

11:38.175 --> 11:40.090
her dead brother's body
on the floor.JESS: All right!

11:44.138 --> 11:46.880
We're getting them out of here.

11:46.923 --> 11:48.751
Both of them.

11:48.795 --> 11:51.232
I am the one
who pulled the trigger,

11:51.275 --> 11:53.930
and I say
we are cleaning it up.

11:58.282 --> 11:59.893
How much time do we have?

in five hours.

cover and... this.

12:10.555 --> 12:12.557

I can.

13:32.333 --> 13:34.335
AUTOMATED VOICE:
Call from Josh.[phone buzzing]

13:35.336 --> 13:36.903
Call from Josh.

13:36.946 --> 13:38.252
Oh, my God.

13:38.295 --> 13:40.123
It's fine.It's fine?Then why is he

13:40.167 --> 13:41.298
calling you
in the middle of the night?

13:41.342 --> 13:43.300
Does he know where you are?No.

13:43.344 --> 13:45.302
No, I just... I was supposed
to go back over there.

13:45.346 --> 13:46.347
Then all this happened.

13:46.390 --> 13:48.479
Missed call from Josh.

13:48.523 --> 13:50.003
Murphy.

13:50.046 --> 13:52.135
You have to call him back,pretend like everything is okay,

13:52.179 --> 13:54.137
'cause he cannot comelooking for you.
No, Felix.

13:54.181 --> 13:57.140
Just do it, please.

14:00.187 --> 14:01.884
Fine.

14:03.146 --> 14:05.148
[sighs]

14:05.192 --> 14:06.584
Call Josh.

14:09.370 --> 14:10.893
Hey, it's me.

14:10.937 --> 14:12.634
Uh... I'm so sorry.

14:12.677 --> 14:13.896
I must have, um...

14:13.940 --> 14:15.202
I must have fallen asleep.

14:15.245 --> 14:16.986
I-- my stomach was
feeling super weird,

14:17.030 --> 14:19.162
and then I laid down
for a second, and...

14:19.206 --> 14:21.512
and, yeah, I guess
I-I fell asleep, so...

14:21.556 --> 14:23.166
Oh, no, no, no, you don't...

14:23.210 --> 14:24.559
you don't have to come over.
No, I'm fine.

14:24.602 --> 14:26.126
I-I think I just needto, like, sleep

14:26.169 --> 14:28.606
a little bit, but...I'll call you tomorrow.

14:29.694 --> 14:32.219
Yeah, me, too.
[laughs softly]

14:32.262 --> 14:33.785
Okay.

14:33.829 --> 14:35.222
Bye.

14:35.265 --> 14:36.614
Did he buy it?

14:36.658 --> 14:38.486
Yeah.

14:38.529 --> 14:39.791
Good.

14:39.835 --> 14:41.358
Where's Jess?

14:41.402 --> 14:42.882
MAX:
She's in the bathroom.

14:51.325 --> 14:53.327
[sighing]

15:04.207 --> 15:05.426
Hey.

15:08.864 --> 15:09.996
Hey.

15:10.039 --> 15:12.389
I just needed
a minute.

15:21.050 --> 15:22.573
[groans softly]

15:24.401 --> 15:25.620
[sniffs]

15:26.882 --> 15:28.405
[sighs]

15:37.240 --> 15:38.938
Are you okay?

15:40.765 --> 15:42.942
I don't know.

15:45.640 --> 15:47.424
[whispers]:
Are you okay?

15:49.078 --> 15:51.428
I'm fine.

15:51.472 --> 15:53.953
You're the one that hadto decide to pull that trigger.

15:55.432 --> 15:57.608
It wasn't a decision.

16:01.395 --> 16:04.093
I would never...

16:04.137 --> 16:07.967
ever let anything happen to you.

16:09.577 --> 16:11.927
Ever.

16:14.843 --> 16:17.454
â™ª

16:17.498 --> 16:19.456
[line ringing]

16:19.500 --> 16:21.632
[sighs]

16:21.676 --> 16:23.112
DEAN:
Nia, it's me, again.

16:23.156 --> 16:25.288
Did you guys get the stuff
out of Guiding Hope?

16:25.332 --> 16:27.464
Look, I told you,
I need my payment today,

16:27.508 --> 16:30.511
so if you need to call me back, I'll be up.

16:36.517 --> 16:37.561
Looks good.

16:37.605 --> 16:39.172
MAX:
Yeah. Like nothing happened.

16:39.215 --> 16:40.521
[light switch clicks]

16:42.871 --> 16:45.395
Uh, Jess,where's your car?

16:45.439 --> 16:48.137
They're not gonna fit in my car.

16:48.181 --> 16:50.183
We can take Sam's.

16:50.226 --> 16:51.532
Okay.

16:51.575 --> 16:54.926
You're not coming with us.

16:54.970 --> 16:56.537
All right,
look, Jess,

16:56.580 --> 16:58.147
you're gonna have to put
whatever it is

16:58.191 --> 16:59.540
you're feeling about me aside

16:59.583 --> 17:01.368
if you want any chance
of getting away with this.

17:04.762 --> 17:08.114
I will pull Sam's car
around to the back.

17:12.901 --> 17:16.470
[door opens, closes]

17:31.180 --> 17:33.139
Max, what are you doing?

17:33.182 --> 17:35.402
Just throwing out
the broken bottles and stuff.

17:35.445 --> 17:38.492
We have to bury everythingwith the bodies. Let's go.

17:44.585 --> 17:46.021
[knocking]

17:53.637 --> 17:56.423
They outsmarted me, Dean.
I couldn't bust 'em.

17:56.466 --> 17:57.728
What?

17:57.772 --> 17:59.034
The Guiding Hope kids.

17:59.078 --> 18:01.123
I know, I know.
I been up all night.

18:01.167 --> 18:02.820
Can I come in?

18:04.822 --> 18:06.259
[sighs]

18:07.651 --> 18:09.871
What's the
temperature outside?

18:14.354 --> 18:16.269
35 degrees.

18:16.312 --> 18:18.097
The ground shouldn't
be frozen.

18:18.140 --> 18:20.490
We can bury the bodies
in the woods.

18:21.839 --> 18:23.276
Uh...
[stammers]

18:23.319 --> 18:24.973
in daylight?

18:25.016 --> 18:26.975
Well, they can't
stay in the car.

18:27.018 --> 18:29.151
Just trust me, I'll
find a secluded spot.

18:29.195 --> 18:30.631
Digging's gonna take forever.

18:30.674 --> 18:33.242
Well, unless you have
a bucket of acid handy,

18:33.286 --> 18:34.809
it's kind of our only option.

18:34.852 --> 18:36.419
But...Just listento her.

18:36.463 --> 18:37.812
No. No, we can't, um...

18:37.855 --> 18:39.640
we-we can't-we can'tjust dump Ben

18:39.683 --> 18:41.990
in a place wherehe'll never be found.

18:42.033 --> 18:43.818
We have to.

18:43.861 --> 18:45.994
Chelsea will have to live
the rest of her life

18:46.037 --> 18:47.300
not knowing
what happened to him.

18:47.343 --> 18:48.866
We can't let that happen.Can't we just

18:48.910 --> 18:51.173
drop him off
at the hospital or something?No, that'll

18:51.217 --> 18:53.306
tip off the cops,
and Ben wasthere,

18:53.349 --> 18:55.656
so it could lead
back to you guys.

18:55.699 --> 18:57.788
Well...
Jess may have killed Nia,

18:57.832 --> 18:58.963
but I killed Ben.MURPHY:
Oh, Felix...

18:59.007 --> 19:00.704
I-I'm the one
that gave him the drugs,

19:00.748 --> 19:02.880
so I think
I should have a say in this.

19:02.924 --> 19:04.882
It wasn't your fault.Yes, it was,

19:04.926 --> 19:06.928
Murphy.Dude, you were the one
who didn't want

19:06.971 --> 19:08.538
to leave him
at the bar for her to find.

19:08.582 --> 19:10.323
Now you want her to find him?
Make him your mind.No!

19:10.366 --> 19:12.281
No, I... I don't know!
I just feel responsible,

19:12.325 --> 19:15.241
and I don't think it's okay
to just dump Ben in the middle

19:15.284 --> 19:18.200
of the woods where he'snever gonna be found! Please!Oh, God.

19:18.244 --> 19:19.636
Fine.

19:19.680 --> 19:21.595
We'll take Ben to a hospital

19:21.638 --> 19:23.336
after we're done
dealing with Nia.

19:23.379 --> 19:24.641
Murphy...STERLING:I really...

19:24.685 --> 19:26.600
I don't think that's...That's what we're doing.

19:28.079 --> 19:29.385
Thank you.

19:32.475 --> 19:34.738
We're gonna haveto get shovels.

19:34.782 --> 19:36.914
STERLING:
Well, we can't buy them.

19:36.958 --> 19:38.655
You don't want to be seen
on security cameras.

19:38.699 --> 19:39.743
MURPHY:We can go

19:39.787 --> 19:41.005
to my parents' house.

19:41.049 --> 19:43.747
They have a bunch of shovels
in the garage.

19:43.791 --> 19:46.794
If we get there quick,
they'll probably be asleep.

19:46.837 --> 19:49.623
GENE:I searched that entireGuiding Hope truck.

19:49.666 --> 19:51.799
Not even a trace of heroin.

19:52.800 --> 19:54.758
Were any of Nia's
guys there?

19:54.802 --> 19:56.847
Maybe they got
to it first.Impossible.

19:56.891 --> 19:58.284
I sat out there.

19:58.327 --> 20:00.373
No one came in or out
except for Max Parish,

20:00.416 --> 20:02.418
Felix Bell and Murphy Mason.

20:02.462 --> 20:04.768
I just...

20:04.812 --> 20:07.206
Can I have one of those?

20:08.294 --> 20:11.253
[sighs]
They're Chloe's, but...

20:11.297 --> 20:14.561
So anyway, I'm thinkingthat they got tipped off

20:14.604 --> 20:15.779
and had someone grab
all the drugs

20:15.823 --> 20:17.085
while I was pulling them over.

20:17.128 --> 20:18.260
I mean, that'sthe only thing that makes sense.

20:19.479 --> 20:20.784
Well, what makes you think

20:20.828 --> 20:22.395
they're not still
in Guiding Hope?

20:22.438 --> 20:24.310
'Cause I searched it.

20:24.353 --> 20:25.746
You got a warrant?

20:26.790 --> 20:28.618
No. No, I...

20:28.662 --> 20:31.317
I took a page out of
the old Dean Riley handbook.

20:31.360 --> 20:33.841
[chuckles] You know,sometimes you got to...

20:33.884 --> 20:36.583
you got to break the rules
to get a little justice.

20:36.626 --> 20:38.846
But, um...

20:38.889 --> 20:41.283
I didn't find nothing
in there, either.

20:41.327 --> 20:44.678
Anyway, I think that wasjust, like, a really,

20:44.721 --> 20:45.983
really long-winded way of saying

20:46.027 --> 20:48.029
I'm sorry I couldn't
get your job back.

20:48.072 --> 20:49.987
Well,

20:50.031 --> 20:51.772
I guess there's nothing left
to do but...

20:51.815 --> 20:54.296
[mumbles]

20:57.343 --> 20:59.301
[exhales]

21:00.824 --> 21:02.435
Sure you don'twant some, bud?

21:02.478 --> 21:04.306
Kind of early.

21:04.350 --> 21:07.091
[chuckles]For real.

21:14.577 --> 21:18.102
My mom keeps her, uh,
gardening stuff in here.

21:18.146 --> 21:20.148
Okay.

21:22.150 --> 21:24.108
Oh, got 'em.Yeah?

21:24.152 --> 21:26.633
Yeah.Uh, okay. And we shouldprobably get some gloves, too.

21:26.676 --> 21:28.983
'Cause I-I know she... I knowshe has a bunch of extra pairs.

21:29.026 --> 21:30.419
Okay, I'll help you find them.

21:30.463 --> 21:32.073
Let me just run these out
to the car really fast.

21:32.116 --> 21:34.118
Okay.

21:36.512 --> 21:38.514
Oh.

21:41.865 --> 21:43.824
JOY:
Murphy?

21:45.826 --> 21:48.481
What in the world
are you doing here?

21:55.444 --> 21:57.141
What happened to your face?

21:57.185 --> 21:59.143
Oh, my God. Come here.

21:59.187 --> 22:01.363
Oh, I'm fine, Mom.I... I'm f... It's fine.

22:01.407 --> 22:04.671
I just... I slipped on some icethis morning at Guiding Hope.

22:04.714 --> 22:06.368
Ice?

22:06.412 --> 22:08.022
You're sure
that's how that happened?

22:08.065 --> 22:10.720
Yeah, it was just some ice.

22:10.764 --> 22:13.375
What were you doing at work
at the crack of dawn?

22:14.420 --> 22:17.205
We have a...this fundraiser, uh, later,

22:17.248 --> 22:20.556
so I-I'm helping set up,and I need that table

22:20.600 --> 22:22.863
that you have for, like,cookies and stuff.

22:22.906 --> 22:25.039
Oh, why didn't you just call me?

22:25.082 --> 22:26.562
I don't know. 'Cause I f...

22:26.606 --> 22:28.477
I felt bad asking you.

22:28.521 --> 22:32.263
I just kind of feel weirdabout everything still.Oh, stop. No, no, no.

22:32.307 --> 22:34.614
I hate to admit it,
but we're actually...

22:34.657 --> 22:37.573
kind of enjoying this time off.

22:38.618 --> 22:41.403
Yeah? That's good.It's really good.

22:41.447 --> 22:43.057
And you can invite us
to these fundraisers.

22:43.100 --> 22:44.275
You know, I can help you.

22:44.319 --> 22:45.581
I've done a
million of them.

22:45.625 --> 22:47.888
No, I-I know. I, uh...It's just the one...

22:47.931 --> 22:49.629
The fundraiser tonight...Oh, no, we can't go tonight.

22:49.672 --> 22:51.108
No. Uh, your dad has

22:51.152 --> 22:54.068
a poker game,
and Aunt Karen is turning 60,

22:54.111 --> 22:56.897
so all the sisters
are going out to Allesandro's.

22:56.940 --> 22:58.768
That sounds fun.Yeah.

22:58.812 --> 23:01.336
Well, Judy's gonna be there.
You know how that goes.

23:01.380 --> 23:04.426
Yeah. Uh, okay, I...

23:04.470 --> 23:06.820
I... I do... I should get going,though, 'cause I...

23:06.863 --> 23:08.778
We have a lot of stuff to do.

23:08.822 --> 23:11.172
All right.
If someone would have told me

23:11.215 --> 23:12.652
you were gonna be up
at 6:00 a.m.

23:12.695 --> 23:15.785
to pick up tables
for a fundraiser...

23:15.829 --> 23:17.787
I'm so proud of you.

23:22.052 --> 23:24.011
Thanks.

23:25.055 --> 23:26.666
Well, here, let me

23:26.709 --> 23:28.494
grab the tables for you.

23:28.537 --> 23:30.060
Oh, that's okay.I'll walk this out.

23:30.104 --> 23:32.498
How-How'd you get here?Uh, a bunch of us drove.

23:32.541 --> 23:34.630
But I-I got it, Mom. It's okay.[scoffs]

23:34.674 --> 23:36.197
Nonsense, nonsense.

23:36.240 --> 23:37.720
All right.

23:43.073 --> 23:45.032
[chuckles]:Hey,

23:45.075 --> 23:46.860
Joy. How are you? Hey.

23:46.903 --> 23:49.123
Oh, I see thisis still happening.

23:49.166 --> 23:51.473
Yep, still happening.

23:51.517 --> 23:52.692
Oh, wow!

23:52.735 --> 23:53.997
The whole gang's here.

23:54.041 --> 23:56.391
Hi! Hi, sweetie.

23:56.435 --> 23:58.045
Hi!Hi.

23:58.088 --> 23:59.699
Hi, Felix.

23:59.742 --> 24:01.744

think we met.

24:01.788 --> 24:03.790
I'm Joy Mason. I'm the cofounderof Guiding Hope.

24:03.833 --> 24:05.487
Oh, it's so nice to meet you.

24:05.531 --> 24:06.967
I'm the kennel tech.

24:08.011 --> 24:09.143
Well, what happened to Victor?

24:09.186 --> 24:12.146
He got a job at Starbucks.

24:12.189 --> 24:13.974
We really got to be going.Yeah.

24:14.017 --> 24:15.323
Yeah. It's sort of late.JESS:Yeah.

24:15.366 --> 24:16.759
Okay, you busy, busy bees.

24:16.803 --> 24:18.021
I'll just, uh,

24:18.065 --> 24:19.327

Okay. Perfect.

24:32.558 --> 24:33.863
Bye.Bye-bye.

24:33.907 --> 24:35.517
I'll just tell your
dad you said hi.

24:35.561 --> 24:36.823
Bye, Mom.

24:36.866 --> 24:38.999
Oh, nice car.

24:39.042 --> 24:41.044
â™ª

25:00.411 --> 25:02.196
Think this is good.

25:02.239 --> 25:05.939
Um, I thought we were drivinginto the middle of the woods.

25:05.982 --> 25:08.028
We are. But it's gonna
be a lot of work,

25:08.071 --> 25:09.508
so we're gonna have
to take shifts.

25:09.551 --> 25:11.553
Whoever's not digging should
stay here and keep watch.

25:11.597 --> 25:13.555
Just make sure you're not
visible from the road.JESS: Cool,

25:13.599 --> 25:15.339
I'll go first.STERLING:Um, you should bring

25:15.383 --> 25:18.081
a phone so that you can
warn us if someone's coming.

25:18.125 --> 25:19.692
You can take mine.

25:19.735 --> 25:21.868
STERLING:Just-just text Felix and get...I got it.

25:21.911 --> 25:23.565
[door opens]

25:24.610 --> 25:27.047
â™ª

25:55.292 --> 25:56.903
How far in did we drive?

25:56.946 --> 25:58.295
Um, I think it was...

25:58.339 --> 26:00.820
Uh, I wasn't asking you.Couple miles.

26:13.397 --> 26:16.357
We can start digging here.

26:16.400 --> 26:19.012
We should bury the evidence
and the trash and stuff

26:19.055 --> 26:20.709
at least a mile away.

26:25.540 --> 26:28.282
You guys want to...
you want to help or...?

26:29.675 --> 26:31.241
All right,give me your hand.

26:31.285 --> 26:32.721

Okay.Dig right there.

26:40.599 --> 26:42.557
It's freezing.
[sniffles]

26:42.601 --> 26:44.559
Hope Jess is warm enough.

26:44.603 --> 26:47.649
Shut up. Stop acting like
you care about Jess.

26:47.693 --> 26:50.434
I do care about her.MURPHY:Oh, you do?

26:50.478 --> 26:53.046
If you did, you wouldn't havelied to her every single day.Oh, my God.

26:53.089 --> 26:55.657
You guys also lied to her
every single day.

26:55.701 --> 26:56.832
We were protecting her.

26:56.876 --> 26:58.573
I don't even know
what you were doing.

26:58.617 --> 27:00.096
I was doing my job.

27:00.140 --> 27:01.445
Your job?

27:01.489 --> 27:03.839
You think that was your...Having sex with Jess

27:03.883 --> 27:06.755
and then getting her to fallin love with you was your job?

27:06.799 --> 27:08.931
Okay, sure, dude.You want to talk about jobs?

27:08.975 --> 27:11.542
All you guys were supposed to dowas launder some money,

27:11.586 --> 27:14.023
and then you did allof this stuff that led to this.

27:14.067 --> 27:15.459
You-You're saying
this is my fault?

27:15.503 --> 27:17.113
It is absolutely your fault.MAX:
Okay. Uh, guys?

27:17.157 --> 27:18.288
Okay, okay, guys?MURPHY: Did you tell Jessit was my fault?

27:18.332 --> 27:19.463
Guys, guys, stop.

27:19.507 --> 27:21.465
Sterling,

27:21.509 --> 27:23.772
why don't you go burythe trash and stuff.

27:23.816 --> 27:25.818
Cool. Fine.

27:29.996 --> 27:31.650
Dude, I can't do this.

27:34.348 --> 27:36.176
DEAN:
Well, it's been

27:36.219 --> 27:38.744
about a half an hour. Why
don't you give another try.

27:39.832 --> 27:41.834
All righty.

Yeah.Finally.

28:00.374 --> 28:01.854
[clears throat]

28:01.897 --> 28:03.725
Those badass pancakesyou made me

28:03.769 --> 28:05.205

28:05.248 --> 28:07.294
Glad to hear it.

Well...

28:12.255 --> 28:14.214
Come here.

28:16.259 --> 28:17.608
Don't be a stranger, okay?

28:17.652 --> 28:19.262
Okay.All right.

28:20.307 --> 28:21.961
All right.

28:22.962 --> 28:25.399
The lean, mean Dean machine.

28:31.013 --> 28:33.015
Chloe, honey?

28:34.713 --> 28:35.975
What's going on?

28:36.018 --> 28:37.759
I just, uh,I just got called into work,

28:37.803 --> 28:39.761
so I'm gonna be gonefor a few hours, okay?

28:39.805 --> 28:43.156
You couldn't have
texted me that?

28:54.167 --> 28:56.169
Oh, my God.

29:02.915 --> 29:04.220
STERLING:Hey.

29:04.264 --> 29:06.396
Is it my turn to dig?

29:06.440 --> 29:08.050
No, not yet. I...

29:08.094 --> 29:09.443
I came to
check on you.

29:09.486 --> 29:11.401
Take my hat.
It's-it's pretty warm.

29:11.445 --> 29:13.229
You must be cold.

29:15.231 --> 29:17.538
Jess, come on. I just
walked, like, 30 minutes.

29:17.581 --> 29:19.018
Oh, oh!

29:19.061 --> 29:22.064
Oh, you walked 30 whole minutes?

29:22.108 --> 29:24.632
Oh, wow.
You know, in that case, I...

29:24.675 --> 29:26.895
I-I forgive you for everything.

29:26.939 --> 29:29.115
Okay, listen, I...Okay, you know what?

29:29.158 --> 29:30.769
No, you listen.I have about a million

29:30.812 --> 29:31.900
other things I haveto worry about right now.

29:31.944 --> 29:34.250
You are not one of them.Please go.

29:34.294 --> 29:35.904
I'm not going anywhere.Okay, well, you know what?

29:35.948 --> 29:37.123
Do whatever you want.I don't care. [scoffs]

29:49.657 --> 29:51.833
Hey, where the hell is Nia?

29:51.877 --> 29:53.443
I can't get ahold of her.

29:53.487 --> 29:55.141
She's gone.

30:01.669 --> 30:03.105
Who did it?

30:06.892 --> 30:08.632
You just let her shoot Nia?I didn't have a weapon.

30:08.676 --> 30:10.721
[knocking]

30:24.387 --> 30:27.260
Where's Nia?

30:27.303 --> 30:28.609
What's it to you?

30:28.652 --> 30:29.915
We have a deal.

30:29.958 --> 30:31.090
She owes me money.

30:31.133 --> 30:32.656
Five percent
of the cartel shipment.

30:32.700 --> 30:34.136
That's not happening.

30:35.137 --> 30:36.269
Drugs are missing.

30:36.312 --> 30:37.618
What?

30:37.661 --> 30:40.490
That Guiding Hope
junkie hid everything

30:40.534 --> 30:43.798
before he offed himself.

30:43.842 --> 30:45.800
I want to talk to Nia.

30:45.844 --> 30:47.106
She's dead.

30:49.151 --> 30:50.326
Wait.

30:50.370 --> 30:52.459
The Guiding Hope kidskilled her, too.

30:52.502 --> 30:54.156
Got nothing for you.

30:54.200 --> 30:55.941

31:19.051 --> 31:20.400
MURPHY:
What's that?

31:21.662 --> 31:23.142
It's time for me to
switch off with Jess.

31:44.903 --> 31:46.078
When Nia was, you know...

31:46.121 --> 31:48.167
Stop. It's okay.

31:48.210 --> 31:50.734
Way worse things

33:09.639 --> 33:10.945

34:57.182 --> 34:59.184
Um, wait, wait, wait.
Um...

35:03.797 --> 35:07.540
What?She's not the only one
going in here.

35:07.583 --> 35:09.846
What?

35:09.890 --> 35:11.370
Sh...

35:11.413 --> 35:13.546
It's just, um...

35:13.589 --> 35:15.548
It's gonna be...

35:15.591 --> 35:18.203
probably safer if-if we putboth of 'em in there.

35:18.246 --> 35:19.421
It makes
sense.

35:20.422 --> 35:21.728
No!

35:21.771 --> 35:23.512
We all agreed to take him
to the hospital.

35:23.556 --> 35:24.992
We all agreed on that.

35:29.431 --> 35:31.129
Oh, you were never
gonna take him.

35:32.565 --> 35:34.262
We knew you wouldn't
do this if we...

35:34.306 --> 35:38.223
I wouldn't do this.
Inever would do this, ever.

35:41.269 --> 35:42.749
Do whatever you want.

35:42.792 --> 35:44.359
You're going to anyway.

35:44.403 --> 35:46.796
I'll go get Sterling.She can help. I'm done.

35:58.460 --> 36:01.289
What we needis to get the drugs.

36:01.333 --> 36:03.291
We need to get justice for Nia.

36:03.335 --> 36:06.207
I know you wantto kill those Guiding Hope kids.

36:06.251 --> 36:08.862
But if they promiseda stash to Josiah

36:08.905 --> 36:10.646
and they didn't deliver,

36:10.690 --> 36:13.040
he'll take care of them.Our hands are clean.

36:13.083 --> 36:14.302
No.

36:14.346 --> 36:16.304
I'll get them myself.

36:16.348 --> 36:19.177
But I actually
wasn't talking about them.

36:23.703 --> 36:27.228
They're not the only ones
responsible for Nia's death.

36:27.272 --> 36:29.317

I'll move your carsaway from the Linsmore.

38:38.228 --> 38:40.013

38:40.056 --> 38:41.667
Thanks for the car.

that off without you, so...

39:12.175 --> 39:14.569
so, thank you.

39:15.918 --> 39:17.659

39:17.703 --> 39:19.487
I don't care about you,but I do...

39:19.531 --> 39:22.142
I know you care about me.

39:23.317 --> 39:25.667
I'm really sorry.

39:27.365 --> 39:29.367
I know that, too.

39:46.645 --> 39:48.603

39:48.647 --> 39:50.910
Um.... here.

39:50.953 --> 39:53.173
No, no, no, keep it.

39:53.216 --> 39:56.655
It would make me sad
every time I looked at it.

39:59.527 --> 40:01.529
Yeah, I get that.

40:04.314 --> 40:06.316
Okay.

40:20.766 --> 40:22.898
We did a good job.

40:22.942 --> 40:24.900
It's gonna be okay.

40:24.944 --> 40:26.946
Where do we go?

40:29.078 --> 40:31.516
My parents have
a cabin in Aspen.

40:31.559 --> 40:33.692
We can hide out
there for a while.

40:33.735 --> 40:35.955
We can't go anywhereNia's people could find us.

40:35.998 --> 40:38.827
I say we drive as far away
from here as possible

40:38.871 --> 40:40.873
and figure it out
on the road.

40:42.918 --> 40:44.442
I have to go home first.

40:44.485 --> 40:45.747
Oh, good idea.

40:45.791 --> 40:47.749
No one'll be looking
for us there.

40:47.793 --> 40:49.751
I have to get Pretzel.

40:49.795 --> 40:51.797
I'm not leaving without him.

40:56.584 --> 40:58.586
Okay.

40:58.630 --> 41:00.022
[engine starts]

41:10.685 --> 41:13.514
Whoa, hey, hang on.Someone broke in.

41:13.558 --> 41:14.820
What?

41:14.863 --> 41:16.865
Oh, it was me.
I kicked the door in.

41:16.909 --> 41:18.693
You're such an idiot.[laughs]

41:18.737 --> 41:21.870
Well, you wouldn't talk to me,
so what was I supposed to...

41:27.659 --> 41:29.356
What?

41:29.399 --> 41:31.532
JOSIAH:

41:31.576 --> 41:33.534
promised me drugs.

41:37.582 --> 41:39.540
Where are my drugs?
