00:00.578 --> 00:01.710
Previously on The Fosters...

00:01.746 --> 00:04.114
- That was Liam.
- Foster brother you told me about?

00:04.148 --> 00:05.315
He forced me to have sex with him.

00:05.349 --> 00:08.018
It wasn't my choice, it wasn't my fault.

00:08.052 --> 00:12.655
11-99, officer down! 663 Coronado Street!

00:12.690 --> 00:15.260
I get that it's forbidden
for foster kids to hook up

00:15.262 --> 00:16.554
with the other kids they live with,

00:16.555 --> 00:17.555
but it's not like they're keeping you.

00:17.578 --> 00:19.562
If you're into Brandon, then go for it.

00:19.597 --> 00:22.532
We chose you, and you chose us.

00:22.566 --> 00:24.634
DNA doesn't make a family, love does.

00:24.872 --> 00:27.640
But you don't think your daughter
has a right to marry Lena?

00:27.675 --> 00:30.610
I believe that marriage is
between a man and a woman.

00:30.644 --> 00:34.380
- Will you marry me?
- I thought you'd never ask.

00:38.452 --> 00:40.119
More?

00:40.154 --> 00:42.255
Come on, it's not like I'm
running a sweatshop here.

00:42.289 --> 00:45.225
I just don't understand why you want
to use all this dirty old silverware.

00:45.259 --> 00:48.261
I like the history, I
like the story behind it.

00:48.295 --> 00:51.931
Like, I wonder if someone died from
the black plague after using this knife?

00:51.966 --> 00:54.100
- We washed it!
- Don't knock the old stuff, kid.

00:54.134 --> 00:55.969
You'll be old yourself before you know it.

00:56.003 --> 00:57.637
You tell him, grandma.

00:57.671 --> 00:59.505
Ok, here we go.

00:59.540 --> 01:01.607
Stef, give me that!

01:01.625 --> 01:03.676
- What?
- You're not supposed to be lifting anything heavy...

01:03.711 --> 01:05.645
It's not heavy. It's been
weeks. Honey, I'm fine.

01:05.679 --> 01:08.414
When I said we need to haul these
old photos out, I meant me, not you.

01:08.449 --> 01:09.716
You're going to have to
let me do something...

01:09.750 --> 01:11.434
I'm going nuts in this house.

01:11.485 --> 01:13.553
When are you going back to work?

01:13.587 --> 01:16.623
I... we're not sure.

01:16.657 --> 01:19.125
Just as soon as I'm cleared, I guess.

01:19.159 --> 01:22.178
The only thing you have to
do is walk down the aisle.

01:22.229 --> 01:24.113
We're not even doing that, so come on!

01:24.164 --> 01:26.165
- You know what I mean.
- You're not?

01:26.200 --> 01:28.101
Your dads aren't giving you away?

01:28.135 --> 01:30.036
No, no. Lena's dad got
ordained on the Internet

01:30.070 --> 01:31.938
so he going to perform
the ceremony, so he's out,

01:31.972 --> 01:35.074
and dad hasn't responded to the invitation.

01:35.109 --> 01:36.215
I mean, come on.

01:36.216 --> 01:38.525
Two women walking down the aisle? Really?

01:38.612 --> 01:40.613
Who's waiting at the other end?

01:40.648 --> 01:42.582
Why are we being given away?

01:42.616 --> 01:45.551
To whom are we being given to?

01:45.586 --> 01:47.620
It's kind of silly, don't you think?

01:47.655 --> 01:51.257
I don't know if it's silly, exactly, but...

01:51.292 --> 01:54.193
- Yeah, it's not us, that's true.
- Yeah.

01:57.264 --> 01:58.331
Oh, Brandon...

02:00.000 --> 02:01.968
- No, no, no. No...
- Mom, I can do it.

02:02.002 --> 02:03.736
Let me do it. Let me do it.

02:03.770 --> 02:05.805
I came early to help, let me help.

02:05.839 --> 02:06.889
Oh, help me.

02:09.943 --> 02:12.962
See? I'm not the only one who gets
tense when her mother's around.

02:13.013 --> 02:14.308
It's not just her.

02:14.309 --> 02:16.333
I mean, she's going to
drive me to an early grave.

02:16.617 --> 02:18.701
Just not looking forward
to the conversation

02:18.702 --> 02:19.702
we have to have with Callie this morning.

02:19.820 --> 02:23.389
- Morning, slug-a-bug.
- Hi.

02:27.744 --> 02:30.363
Hey Callie, can we talk to you for a sec?

02:30.397 --> 02:31.647
Sure. What's up?

02:31.682 --> 02:34.450
It's about Liam.

02:35.652 --> 02:37.453
Yeah.

03:23.016 --> 03:27.437
Hey. So, I guess Brandon
and Talya are back on?

03:27.488 --> 03:31.056
- How'd that happen?
- I don't know. It just did.

03:31.075 --> 03:34.160
- That's too bad.
- It's for the best.

03:34.194 --> 03:36.446
If you say so.

03:36.497 --> 03:39.449
I actually came over to say goodbye.

03:39.500 --> 03:41.200
What do you mean?

03:41.234 --> 03:44.203
Well, since we lost the house,
my mom's been freaking out.

03:44.237 --> 03:46.122
So, she decided that we should go back and

03:46.173 --> 03:49.408
live with my grandparents
for a while. In Indiana.

03:49.426 --> 03:53.112
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

03:53.147 --> 03:56.149
Yeah, this is not one of my weird
attempts at a joke that you never got.

03:58.318 --> 04:00.420
Wow...

04:00.454 --> 04:03.356
So, my mom left with
the u-haul last weekend,

04:03.390 --> 04:07.160
I'm driving out on Sunday with the car.

04:07.194 --> 04:10.113
This sucks.

04:10.147 --> 04:12.097
It kind of does.

04:13.033 --> 04:15.267
I'm really...

04:15.285 --> 04:17.370
really going to miss you.

04:19.072 --> 04:20.406
Me, too.

04:36.173 --> 04:37.456
I don't know what to get your moms.

04:37.474 --> 04:40.059
And you want me to go shopping?

04:40.093 --> 04:42.395
Yes. Tomorrow night.

04:42.429 --> 04:45.181
Ok.

04:45.232 --> 04:47.316
Thank you.

04:50.303 --> 04:53.406
Hey, I'm going to go
talk to Callie real quick.

04:53.440 --> 04:56.325
Ok. You should ask her if
she wants to come with us.

04:56.360 --> 04:58.945
Ok, I'll do that.

05:03.283 --> 05:05.051
You ok?

05:07.387 --> 05:10.223
- What's going on?
- Nothing.

05:12.259 --> 05:17.029
I have to decide today if I want
to go through with the pretrial.

05:18.866 --> 05:20.066
Ok.

05:20.100 --> 05:23.636
Your mom said it's going to
come down to my word against his.

05:23.670 --> 05:26.706
Those kind of things don't
usually go my way, you know.

05:27.975 --> 05:29.909
I mean, Sarah's safe, right?

05:29.943 --> 05:34.680
She's out of the house... you
know, wasn't that the real goal?

05:36.717 --> 05:41.087
What you did for Sarah is great.

05:42.389 --> 05:46.025
But what about what he did to you?

05:46.059 --> 05:49.161
Don't you think you deserve some justice?

05:54.134 --> 05:56.035
I got to get to class.

06:15.059 --> 06:19.029
Sorry, I didn't mean to
make you self-conscious.

06:19.063 --> 06:20.964
Well, I'm fine.

06:20.999 --> 06:23.717
I'm not the one who's bothered by it.

06:23.768 --> 06:25.376
I'm not bothered by it. It's just...

06:25.677 --> 06:27.124
it's a constant reminder, you know?

06:27.639 --> 06:28.889
I do.

06:28.923 --> 06:32.609
It's not just what happened it's...

06:32.644 --> 06:36.413
You'll probably be going back
to work soon and it makes me...

06:36.447 --> 06:38.448
I know.

06:38.483 --> 06:39.616
I can't stay home forever, love.

06:43.288 --> 06:46.223
I can't believe you kept this wallpaper.

06:46.257 --> 06:49.193
- You picked it out.
- In 1982.

06:49.227 --> 06:51.328
And I was wearing Holly Hobbie dresses,

06:51.362 --> 06:53.964
and scrunch socks with high tops.

06:55.934 --> 06:58.235
Did you hear about Kim and Darryl?

06:58.269 --> 07:00.804
She's having an affair with her stepson.

07:00.839 --> 07:02.276
Ain't that the craziest
thing you ever heard?

07:03.277 --> 07:04.604
Well, this is dead.

07:04.876 --> 07:06.201
Speaking of crazy,

07:06.202 --> 07:09.975
did you know that Lena's father is
performing the ceremony on Saturday?

07:09.988 --> 07:11.971
Got ordained online or something...

07:11.972 --> 07:13.653
Church of the three stooges.

07:13.671 --> 07:15.839
Can you imagine if they
had that in our day?

07:15.873 --> 07:18.508
We wouldn't have had to go to Vegas.

07:18.542 --> 07:21.611
It doesn't matter who does it,
it's going to be a lovely afternoon.

07:21.645 --> 07:23.056
The kids are so excited.

07:23.057 --> 07:24.770
They're happy you're coming.

07:25.255 --> 07:26.441
You are coming, aren't you?

07:26.584 --> 07:28.652
I'm just assuming since it's
your only daughter's wedding,

07:28.686 --> 07:31.254
that you will be there, right?

07:31.289 --> 07:34.324
You know, I can't believe I'm
using these words, but Sharon,

07:34.359 --> 07:37.500
- you got something to say, then say it.
- Fine.

07:37.521 --> 07:40.030
You need to let go of
whatever's preventing you from

07:40.048 --> 07:42.099
RSVPing to your daughter's wedding.

07:42.133 --> 07:44.101
God, politics, I don't care.

07:44.135 --> 07:46.937
Unless you want to risk losing her forever,

07:46.971 --> 07:49.906
like we almost did last
month might I remind you,

07:49.941 --> 07:54.978
then you need to get over
yourself and put on a nice shirt

07:54.996 --> 07:59.599
and haul your saggy ass to
that wedding on Saturday.

08:11.596 --> 08:13.613
So, I was thinking...

08:13.648 --> 08:17.067
do you want to, you know...

08:17.101 --> 08:19.169
again?

08:19.203 --> 08:21.004
Wait. What?

08:21.039 --> 08:22.720
I was just wondering if, you know,

08:22.721 --> 08:24.350
you wanted to have sex again.

08:24.876 --> 08:26.276
Whoa, whoa... Lexi.

08:26.310 --> 08:28.912
I thought we agreed we weren't
going to do this again right now.

08:28.946 --> 08:31.915
We're not even supposed to
be alone in my room like this.

08:31.949 --> 08:35.018
I know, I just want to
feel close to you again.

08:35.053 --> 08:38.554
I'm confused. I feel like this is a test,

08:38.589 --> 08:40.590
or a trick question or something...

08:41.909 --> 08:44.494
You know what, forget it.

08:44.529 --> 08:46.630
Forget I said anything.

08:46.664 --> 08:49.366
I'm going to go. I have
homework I need to do.

08:49.400 --> 08:51.218
Wait, Lexi, come on.

08:51.252 --> 08:54.137
Come on yourself, Jesus.

08:59.143 --> 09:01.211
So, here's the truth.

09:01.245 --> 09:03.914
There's no way this case is
ever getting in front of a jury.

09:03.948 --> 09:05.097
The judge is going to throw it out,

09:05.098 --> 09:06.517
as sure as I'm sitting here.

09:07.051 --> 09:08.218
There's no direct evidence.

09:08.252 --> 09:11.738
It's been, what, almost
two years since it happened?

09:11.789 --> 09:13.957
And it's just you.

09:13.991 --> 09:17.561
And with your record,
everything in your file...

09:17.595 --> 09:19.680
I mean, I told you when
we first arrested him,

09:19.681 --> 09:20.681
that this was a long shot.

09:22.633 --> 09:25.535
It's not fair. I'm sorry.

09:30.208 --> 09:35.345
On the other hand, if the sex
with Liam had been consensual...

09:35.379 --> 09:37.147
that would be a different story.

09:37.181 --> 09:39.082
But it wasn't. It was not.

09:39.117 --> 09:42.119
If it was consensual, well,
based on your age difference,

09:42.153 --> 09:44.855
that would be statutory rape.

09:44.889 --> 09:47.991
And Liam might just go
to jail for up to a year.

09:53.531 --> 09:56.961
So, you're saying that
nobody will believe that

09:56.962 --> 09:57.962
he forced me to have sex,

09:58.569 --> 10:01.471
but they might believe that
I did it 'cause I wanted to?

10:01.506 --> 10:03.273
And that Liam would go to jail for that?

10:03.307 --> 10:06.476
Yes. That's exactly what I'm saying.

10:15.538 --> 10:18.540
- Hey Mike, thanks.
- Hey.

10:18.575 --> 10:20.576
No, no. You supervise, ok?

10:20.610 --> 10:23.779
Ok. Between you, Lena and my
mother, I'm going to go nuts.

10:23.813 --> 10:26.298
What's new?

10:26.332 --> 10:29.268
So, you going to go back to work?

10:29.319 --> 10:31.620
- Nope.
- What?

10:31.654 --> 10:35.290
They're hanging me out to dry, Stef.

10:35.325 --> 10:38.193
Ana's saying her boyfriend dropped the gun,

10:38.228 --> 10:41.997
he had his hands up.
You know, in surrender.

10:42.065 --> 10:44.249
- That's not true.
- What?

10:47.270 --> 10:51.807
He didn't put his hands up, Mike. I saw it.

10:51.841 --> 10:53.809
You told I.A. that...

10:53.843 --> 10:55.978
That I was unconscious
or in shock or something.

10:56.012 --> 10:57.946
I didn't want to contradict you in case

10:57.981 --> 11:00.616
- you said something in your statement...
- Whoa, hold on, wait.

11:00.650 --> 11:02.551
So, you thought I might be lying?

11:02.585 --> 11:05.621
He dropped the gun,
Mike. Before you shot him.

11:05.655 --> 11:08.423
You sure?

11:10.360 --> 11:12.294
Mike, listen, you heard gunshots,

11:12.328 --> 11:14.429
you were amped on adrenaline
and I was lying on the ground.

11:14.464 --> 11:17.082
Of course you thought
that he still had the gun.

11:17.116 --> 11:19.067
- But he didn't.
- No, he dropped it.

11:19.102 --> 11:22.037
But he did not have his hands up.
You did exactly the right thing.

11:26.843 --> 11:29.812
I'm going to talk to Roberts
and change my statement today.

11:29.846 --> 11:31.046
- Absolutely not.
- Yes.

11:31.064 --> 11:32.781
- No, Stef.
- No, Mike...

11:32.816 --> 11:34.716
They're going to think
you're lying to cover my ass.

11:34.751 --> 11:37.553
Or worse, they're going to
figure out you lied before.

11:37.587 --> 11:38.358
You know what that means?

11:38.359 --> 11:40.343
They'll fire you as soon as look at you.

11:40.523 --> 11:43.525
No, you've got the family to think about.

11:43.560 --> 11:45.244
Look, I might lose my job.

11:45.295 --> 11:47.529
But you do that, you'll
definitely lose yours.

11:47.564 --> 11:49.498
Absolutely not.

11:54.237 --> 11:56.104
Come on, you're not supposed to do that.

11:56.139 --> 11:57.990
I'm not letting you do everything, Mike.

12:02.278 --> 12:04.112
Mind if I?

12:09.002 --> 12:12.788
So? How'd it go?

12:12.822 --> 12:14.523
Not great.

12:14.557 --> 12:15.724
Well, what happened?

12:15.758 --> 12:19.528
Like they were ever going to believe me.

12:19.562 --> 12:22.364
What, the A.D.A. said
they didn't believe you?

12:22.398 --> 12:24.700
No, he said a jury wouldn't.

12:27.604 --> 12:30.539
Well, I'm sure it's going
to work out. Somehow.

12:30.573 --> 12:33.041
- Sometimes, you know...
- No.

12:33.076 --> 12:38.347
No, you do not get to
say those things to me.

12:38.381 --> 12:42.050
I'm not you. I don't
live in this magical world

12:42.085 --> 12:45.053
where everything always works out, ok?

12:45.088 --> 12:47.898
So, stop. Stop with the pep-talks

12:47.899 --> 12:49.530
and telling me everything's gonna be ok,

12:49.592 --> 12:50.993
'cause you know what
they want me to do next?

12:51.027 --> 12:53.562
They want me to lie.

12:53.596 --> 12:55.797
They said that the only way

12:55.832 --> 12:58.700
to get a jury to believe that
I'm telling the truth is if I lie.

12:58.735 --> 13:00.402
And how is that ok?

13:08.444 --> 13:11.480
Look who I found! Reverend and Mrs. Adams.

13:11.514 --> 13:13.282
Mom! Daddy!

13:15.285 --> 13:17.085
Oh, the ministry looks good on you.

13:17.120 --> 13:19.087
Thanks. Cost me 29.99.

13:19.122 --> 13:21.189
- Oh, yes. Hello, beautiful.
- Hey, mommy.

13:21.207 --> 13:24.192
- Oh, you look tired.
- It's good to see you, too.

13:24.227 --> 13:25.894
Who needs a glass of wine?

13:25.929 --> 13:28.730
- Me, please.
- Me, too.

13:28.765 --> 13:30.699
Your mother was, unsurprisingly,

13:30.733 --> 13:32.701
doing a little backseat driving
on the way from the airport.

13:32.735 --> 13:34.903
I was not. I was doing
passenger seat driving.

13:34.938 --> 13:36.805
I'm back!

13:36.839 --> 13:39.408
Hey, look who's here!

13:39.442 --> 13:40.976
- Hello!
- Good to see you.

13:41.010 --> 13:42.002
What took you so long?

13:42.003 --> 13:43.657
I thought you were just picking up
a few things at the grocery store?

13:44.247 --> 13:46.648
Well, I decided I'd stop by the mall

13:46.683 --> 13:50.519
to see if I could find myself something a
little special for the wedding on Saturday,

13:50.553 --> 13:55.290
and I think I may have
found something for you, too.

13:55.325 --> 13:58.226
- For what?
- The ceremony.

13:58.261 --> 14:01.263
I already know what I'm
wearing for the ceremony, mom.

14:01.297 --> 14:04.866
Don't just dismiss it before
you've even seen it, Stefanie.

14:04.901 --> 14:06.902
I also stopped by your father's.

14:06.936 --> 14:09.604
That got sorted out. He
will be at the wedding.

14:10.807 --> 14:12.841
That's great. Thanks, mom.

14:12.875 --> 14:15.744
Oh, boy. Wine, yum.

14:15.778 --> 14:18.847
Oh, speaking of the wedding...

14:20.416 --> 14:21.516
I'm running this show, right?

14:21.551 --> 14:24.586
- Mmhm.
- And I assume we're not doing the traditional,

14:24.620 --> 14:26.605
"in sickness and in health" mumbo jumbo.

14:26.639 --> 14:29.224
- No.
- So...

14:30.259 --> 14:32.127
Have you ladies written your vows?

14:32.161 --> 14:34.296
- Yes.
- We're not doing vows... are we?

14:38.101 --> 14:40.902
Well, without vows, it's really just
a bunch of people standing around

14:40.877 --> 14:42.711
looking at you two for
no good reason, isn't it?

14:43.980 --> 14:48.483
No, I just... you have a
very good point, Reverend.

14:48.518 --> 14:52.421
Well, I think you two have
too much on your plates,

14:52.455 --> 14:54.656
and you simply must let
Sharon and me pitch in.

14:54.691 --> 14:57.259
Yes, that would give us something to do.

14:57.293 --> 14:59.561
And you guys could just sit back and relax.

14:59.595 --> 15:03.465
Yeah, that's unlikely to happen.

15:08.204 --> 15:11.273
But if you and Sharon would like to

15:11.307 --> 15:16.778
take care of the flowers and the
decorations, that would be great.

15:18.848 --> 15:20.649
- Great.
- Great.

15:25.672 --> 15:26.888
Can't sleep?

15:26.923 --> 15:28.724
No.

15:30.660 --> 15:33.395
I can't stop thinking about tomorrow.

15:36.532 --> 15:41.370
I have no idea what you're
going through, you know.

15:41.404 --> 15:45.040
But I do know a lot about lying.

15:48.177 --> 15:53.615
One lie turns into all these other lies.

15:53.649 --> 15:56.554
And before you know it,

15:56.588 --> 15:59.791
things are just...

15:59.825 --> 16:02.460
you know?

16:02.494 --> 16:06.564
Look, whatever you decide,

16:06.598 --> 16:10.068
you know we've got you, right?

16:11.236 --> 16:12.971
I do.

16:21.313 --> 16:24.716
But I really want you
to put that bastard away.

16:32.925 --> 16:35.626
So, at the time of the
incident, how old were you?

16:35.661 --> 16:37.662
Just turned 15.

16:37.696 --> 16:40.465
- You had just turned 15?
- Yes.

16:40.499 --> 16:44.202
And how old was Mr. Olmstead
at the time of the incident?

16:44.236 --> 16:46.104
Nineteen.

16:47.339 --> 16:52.010
And how would you describe
what happened that night?

16:52.044 --> 16:54.946
Would you say it was consensual?

17:05.491 --> 17:07.558
I know what you want me to say.

17:09.528 --> 17:15.165
You want me to say, "yes, it was
consensual. Yes, I agreed to it."

17:15.200 --> 17:18.102
Because then you can get
Liam on a technicality,

17:18.137 --> 17:22.040
and he'll get a little bit of
punishment for the wrong crime.

17:22.074 --> 17:26.911
And you'll feel good about that because,
really, that's more than I should expect.

17:29.214 --> 17:34.802
I want him to go to jail, believe me. I do.

17:34.837 --> 17:37.688
But, in order to make that happen,

17:37.723 --> 17:42.727
I would have to give away
the only thing I have left.

17:45.397 --> 17:48.366
The truth.

17:58.243 --> 17:59.758
You know what you did to me.

18:00.523 --> 18:02.039
I know what you did to me.

18:02.981 --> 18:05.049
So, I'm not going to lie about it.

18:07.052 --> 18:09.954
No, it was not consensual.

18:09.988 --> 18:11.722
No.

18:12.825 --> 18:14.759
He raped me.

18:40.338 --> 18:42.856
I still feel like we should've cancelled.

18:42.890 --> 18:45.759
Having this giant party when Callie
just went through all of that.

18:45.793 --> 18:47.044
Hey, listen. I checked in with her.

18:47.095 --> 18:49.780
She's grateful for the
distraction, all right?

18:49.814 --> 18:51.008
She's such a good kid.

18:51.009 --> 18:52.903
She deserves a lot better
than what she got today.

18:52.934 --> 18:54.703
I was so proud of her,

18:54.704 --> 18:57.749
and so sure the judge was
going to see it her way...

18:57.772 --> 19:01.475
- It's not how it works.
- Yeah, well, that sucks.

19:01.509 --> 19:06.446
Yeah, it does. But she did the right thing.

19:06.481 --> 19:09.262
Hopefully, someday, somehow,

19:09.763 --> 19:10.263
something good will come out of it.

19:10.485 --> 19:13.186
It was everything I could do
to not just stand up and shout,

19:13.221 --> 19:15.422
"this girl is not her file."

19:15.456 --> 19:17.324
I can't imagine how
awful that must feel to be

19:17.358 --> 19:20.460
reduced to a few sentences about
every mistake you ever made.

19:20.495 --> 19:23.363
That girl just needs a break.

19:29.037 --> 19:31.038
Hey.

19:31.072 --> 19:33.140
What's wrong?

19:33.174 --> 19:34.908
Nothing.

19:34.942 --> 19:37.711
Please. Girl, is it my brother?

19:37.745 --> 19:39.062
No.

19:39.097 --> 19:41.999
Well, not exactly.

19:42.033 --> 19:44.668
My abuelita in Honduras is sick.

19:44.719 --> 19:47.571
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- It's not that.

19:47.622 --> 19:48.622
I mean, I never even met her.

19:50.323 --> 19:52.075
But my parents are talking about

19:52.560 --> 19:54.528
going back to see her.

19:54.562 --> 19:57.564
How can you do that
since you're, you know...

19:57.598 --> 19:59.549
My dad says he has a way
to get us there and back.

19:59.690 --> 20:01.658
Wow.

20:03.377 --> 20:05.378
Don't tell Jesus, ok?

20:06.264 --> 20:07.564
Why not?

20:07.598 --> 20:11.251
I just... I don't want to worry him.

20:11.285 --> 20:14.054
I mean, it's probably
not even going to happen.

20:14.105 --> 20:15.205
Promise?

20:17.208 --> 20:19.042
Ok.

20:21.212 --> 20:24.214
I mean, that's awfully pretty,
but it's just, I don't know...

20:24.248 --> 20:27.818
it's a wedding, it's a
party, it's a celebration.

20:27.852 --> 20:29.753
It just seems to me like, you know,

20:29.787 --> 20:33.890
something like that
would be a lot more fun.

20:33.925 --> 20:35.725
Well, I do like that,

20:35.760 --> 20:39.463
but I can't help feeling that what
would make the day really special

20:39.497 --> 20:41.565
is something a little more sophisticated.

20:41.599 --> 20:44.468
- Sophisticated.
- I didn't mean...

20:44.502 --> 20:46.336
No, of course you didn't.

20:46.370 --> 20:50.073
I didn't realize that "sophisticated"
actually meant "stick up your ass".

20:50.107 --> 20:52.042
Hey, how's it going?

20:52.076 --> 20:54.177
- Just great...
- Perfect, terrific.

20:54.212 --> 20:57.948
I think I'll take a little break.

20:57.982 --> 21:00.917
I think you should have your wife-to-be
talk a little sense into her mother.

21:00.952 --> 21:02.118
- Dana, perhaps it would be best...
- Stewart.

21:02.153 --> 21:04.821
Sharon, who's a lovely woman,

21:04.856 --> 21:07.791
has, and I mean this in
the best possible way,

21:07.825 --> 21:09.860
somewhat questionable taste.

21:09.894 --> 21:13.663
And so we therefore now find ourselves
at an impasse regarding the flowers.

21:13.698 --> 21:16.366
- Mom, it's flowers. How bad can it be?
- Daisies.

21:16.400 --> 21:19.236
She wants daisies. Multi-colored daisies.

21:19.270 --> 21:20.286
So no, honey, it's not that bad,

21:20.287 --> 21:21.287
if you don't mind having a clown wedding.

21:21.672 --> 21:23.507
Ok, mom, let's just take a breath.

21:23.541 --> 21:25.509
There's no need to be so judgmental.

21:25.543 --> 21:27.244
I'm not being judgmental.

21:27.278 --> 21:30.113
I am trying to give you a beautiful day.

21:30.147 --> 21:32.115
- And I appreciate that.
- I don't think that you do.

21:32.149 --> 21:37.020
- Dana, she didn't...
- Well, her gratitude is overwhelming.

21:40.658 --> 21:42.792
Calla lilies? Calla lilies?

21:42.826 --> 21:44.661
What does she think,
we're having a funeral?

21:44.695 --> 21:46.563
"They're sophisticated," she said.

21:46.597 --> 21:48.532
I don't know what to tell you, mom.

21:48.566 --> 21:52.335
Tell me you'll wear this dress.

21:52.370 --> 21:54.604
Oh, we have been through this, mom.

21:54.639 --> 21:57.240
- You're wearing pants.
- Yes.

21:57.275 --> 22:00.310
- Really, stefanie, pants?
- Yes.

22:00.344 --> 22:03.079
- At your wedding? Really?
- Mom, it has been decided.

22:03.114 --> 22:05.382
- Let it go!
- Fine.

22:05.416 --> 22:07.434
- Thank you.
- You're so stubborn.

22:07.468 --> 22:09.319
You are just like your father.

22:09.353 --> 22:14.291
Ok, why am I stubborn because I want to
wear what I want to wear on my wedding day?

22:14.325 --> 22:17.861
And you wanted to take care of
the flowers, so take care of them.

22:17.895 --> 22:23.667
I don't care if we have white calla
lilies or day-glo gerber daisies.

22:23.701 --> 22:27.837
I just want this day to be here so we
don't have to talk about it anymore.

22:33.578 --> 22:36.296
Mom... mother. Oh, the hand.

22:36.347 --> 22:38.381
I got the hand. Ok.

22:43.154 --> 22:44.254
It's not just me, right? They're crazy.

22:44.288 --> 22:46.156
- They're crazy-making.
- No, it's not just you.

22:46.190 --> 22:48.191
- Thank you.
- No, thank you for not being crazy.

22:48.225 --> 22:51.928
All of this fuss over some stupid wedding!

22:55.032 --> 22:59.135
Is there a reason you insist on
referring to it as a "stupid wedding?"

23:00.871 --> 23:03.974
- No, it's just...
- Because ever since you proposed to me,

23:04.008 --> 23:06.610
you've been making cracks
about how "dumb" it is,

23:06.644 --> 23:08.478
and how "silly" these traditions are,

23:08.512 --> 23:11.481
and you've been downright hostile
towards anything as "ridiculous" as

23:11.515 --> 23:14.451
walking down the aisle, or wearing
a dress, or even writing vows!

23:14.485 --> 23:17.554
Don't do me any favors. If you don't
want to get married, let's just not.

23:17.588 --> 23:20.223
Let's just not get married.

23:25.566 --> 23:26.980
Thank God. I thought it was your mother.

23:26.981 --> 23:28.469
No, it's just me.

23:28.971 --> 23:31.139
Come on in. Have a seat.
You want a sandwich?

23:31.173 --> 23:33.058
No, no. I'm good.

23:33.092 --> 23:35.730
Mm. So, why the drop by?

23:35.731 --> 23:37.193
I already told your mother
I was coming tomorrow.

23:37.163 --> 23:39.848
Yeah, I know about that.

23:39.882 --> 23:42.751
I think mom forced your hand
on that and that's not what I...

23:42.785 --> 23:46.688
Well, don't blame your
mother. She can't help herself.

23:53.629 --> 23:55.764
I've been really embarrassed
about this wedding.

23:55.798 --> 24:01.436
I haven't been able to enjoy
one single solitary second of it.

24:01.470 --> 24:05.407
This voice in my head keeps telling
me it's not right what we're doing.

24:05.441 --> 24:07.442
Two women standing up in
front of friends and family

24:07.476 --> 24:09.344
promising to love each
other forever. That's wrong.

24:12.915 --> 24:14.282
How screwed up is that?

24:14.317 --> 24:16.851
I'm embarrassed by my own
wedding? How is that even possible?

24:16.886 --> 24:22.724
I love Lena and my... family,

24:22.758 --> 24:25.694
more than I have loved
anything ever in my life.

24:27.596 --> 24:30.632
How can I possibly be even
the slightest bit uncomfortable

24:30.666 --> 24:33.501
putting that out in the world to see?

24:33.536 --> 24:39.341
And I realized that voice, that
voice it's not mine. It's yours, dad.

24:39.375 --> 24:41.543
It's yours, and I'm done.

24:41.577 --> 24:45.113
I'm done listening to it.

24:45.147 --> 24:49.150
And I don't want that voice at my
wedding, dad. I don't want it there.

24:49.185 --> 24:51.920
And I don't...

24:51.954 --> 24:53.888
I don't want you there.

25:00.763 --> 25:05.600
There shouldn't be anyone there who
is not 100 percent happy to be there.

25:05.634 --> 25:07.614
So, if you can't get behind this wedding

25:07.615 --> 25:11.015
and I mean really, really behind it, dad...

25:15.411 --> 25:18.146
then I don't think you
should come and that's...

25:39.701 --> 25:41.936
We missed you at dinner.

25:41.971 --> 25:45.640
Yeah, I had some stuff I needed
to take care of for the wedding.

25:54.350 --> 25:56.151
I'm sorry I snapped at you, mom.

25:56.185 --> 25:59.287
And I know I didn't turn out to
be the daughter you dreamed of,

25:59.321 --> 26:02.057
but I can't wear a dress
just because you want me to.

26:02.091 --> 26:04.159
I can't believe you'd even say that.

26:04.193 --> 26:06.895
I got caught up in the hullabaloo.

26:06.929 --> 26:11.066
I don't care if you wear a bikini,
or overalls, or a flak jacket, really.

26:13.969 --> 26:17.806
But you're right about one thing,
you're not the daughter I dreamed of.

26:19.775 --> 26:22.444
You're better.

26:57.813 --> 26:59.814
Of course I want to marry you.

27:02.952 --> 27:05.620
I'd be crazy not to.

27:19.135 --> 27:20.401
Are we sure about this?

27:25.241 --> 27:27.876
Then I want to tell them. Today.

27:27.910 --> 27:30.245
I don't want them to come
to the wedding not knowing.

27:33.983 --> 27:36.885
So, we've already spoken with
Brandon and the twins about this,

27:36.919 --> 27:40.755
but there's something
we'd like to ask you guys.

27:40.789 --> 27:44.759
We would like to know
how you would feel about

27:44.793 --> 27:48.496
making this a more permanent arrangement?

27:48.531 --> 27:50.331
You mean, like adopt us?

27:50.366 --> 27:54.469
We think you deserve a home,
and we'd like it to be ours.

27:59.208 --> 28:01.042
Are you guys ok with this?

28:04.079 --> 28:05.980
There's enough to go around.

28:11.820 --> 28:12.987
- So, is that a yes?
- Yeah.

28:13.022 --> 28:14.889
- Yes?
- Yes!

28:14.924 --> 28:17.825
Yes, they said yes!

28:31.407 --> 28:33.725
Hey, can I talk to you a sec?

28:33.776 --> 28:36.377
Sure, what's up?

28:44.253 --> 28:46.321
You better open that or people
will think we're having sex.

28:46.355 --> 28:50.191
Which, you know, we're not. So...

28:52.077 --> 28:53.394
So, why didn't you tell me?

28:54.463 --> 28:56.331
About Honduras, dummy.

28:56.365 --> 28:59.300
I'm going to kill your sister.

28:59.335 --> 29:01.970
I didn't want to worry
you if it didn't happen,

29:02.004 --> 29:04.138
but it looks like we're going.

29:04.173 --> 29:06.007
My grandma's getting worse.

29:06.041 --> 29:09.677
I can't promise that I won't be worried.

29:09.712 --> 29:13.514
But I'll be waiting here till you get back.

29:16.485 --> 29:17.785
You're not going to forget about me?

29:17.820 --> 29:20.371
I can never forget about you.

29:30.466 --> 29:32.333
I wanted to thank you.

29:32.368 --> 29:33.309
For what?

29:33.310 --> 29:35.956
You were kind of yelling at
me last time we were alone.

29:36.205 --> 29:40.008
Yeah, I know...

29:40.042 --> 29:44.078
I wanted to thank you for believing in me

29:44.113 --> 29:46.080
when I didn't believe in myself.

29:46.115 --> 29:48.082
Any time.

29:49.718 --> 29:53.921
You know, I might not have
gotten the outcome I wanted.

29:53.956 --> 29:56.591
With the trial, I might not have
gotten the justice I deserve,

29:56.625 --> 30:01.729
but I know what I deserve now. So...

30:03.832 --> 30:05.667
Do you?

30:07.503 --> 30:11.439
Because you do. You deserve to be happy.

30:12.508 --> 30:17.378
You are amazing, and kind,

30:17.413 --> 30:22.884
and smart, and beautiful...

30:24.253 --> 30:26.854
and you deserve to be happy.

30:27.990 --> 30:30.108
You deserve to have everything you want.

30:32.761 --> 30:33.961
Don't you?

30:42.438 --> 30:43.637
Hi, Mrs. Elkin.

30:43.656 --> 30:45.473
Hi there, Talya! How are you?

30:45.491 --> 30:47.342
I'm good. Have you seen your grandson?

30:47.376 --> 30:49.477
Brandon, let me see. He was...

30:49.511 --> 30:52.230
he was right there a minute ago.

30:52.281 --> 30:53.581
Ok, thanks.

31:19.942 --> 31:22.026
Hey!

31:22.061 --> 31:24.712
What are you doing back here? Come on.

31:28.941 --> 31:29.897
Jude, stop!

31:30.244 --> 31:31.945
Why do you have to ruin everything?

31:31.979 --> 31:34.013
I like it here, they were going to keep us.

31:34.031 --> 31:36.833
I'll never do it again.
Ok, Jude? I promise.

31:36.884 --> 31:38.184
Yes, you will,

31:38.219 --> 31:40.954
or you'll find some other
way to ruin everything,

31:40.988 --> 31:42.689
because that's what you do.

31:42.723 --> 31:43.924
You can't ever just let things be,

31:43.958 --> 31:45.792
'cause you don't know how to do that.

31:45.826 --> 31:47.961
- Jude.
- But you don't just ruin things for you,

31:47.995 --> 31:51.598
you ruin them for me, too.
'Cause we're a package deal.

31:51.632 --> 31:52.866
You know they're not going to separate us.

31:52.900 --> 31:56.603
You act like you care about
me so much, but you don't,

31:56.637 --> 31:59.306
you only care about
yourself. You're selfish.

32:04.645 --> 32:07.547
We always knew she'd
recover like a trouper.

32:07.581 --> 32:12.319
All I know is, I'm so glad she's
coming back to work next week.

32:17.224 --> 32:20.827
I was waiting until after
the wedding to tell you.

32:23.164 --> 32:25.832
- Will you excuse us for a minute?
- Certainly.

32:31.639 --> 32:33.907
Lena... Lena.

32:33.941 --> 32:36.676
What are you doing? Lena, what are you...

32:44.652 --> 32:48.254
I'm making my peace with it.

32:48.289 --> 32:50.390
If I'm going to marry you,
I'm going to marry all of you.

32:52.259 --> 32:55.161
The scar, the bullet, and the cop.

32:57.465 --> 32:59.999
Welcome friends.

33:00.017 --> 33:03.236
Now that the Supreme Court
has finally seen fit...

33:06.040 --> 33:09.876
It has finally seen fit to
recognize that all people

33:09.910 --> 33:14.047
are entitled to equal
protection under the law

33:14.081 --> 33:19.919
and have the right to the
same challenges and triumphs,

33:19.954 --> 33:25.458
benefits and burdens, as everybody else.

33:25.493 --> 33:29.396
I'm very proud to welcome
you here to the marriage

33:29.430 --> 33:33.333
of my daughter, Lena Elizabeth Adams,

33:33.367 --> 33:38.405
to stefanie Marie Foster.

33:38.439 --> 33:43.877
And we're honored that
you are here to witness

33:43.911 --> 33:45.211
this magical event.

33:45.246 --> 33:49.783
The moment when two souls
declare that they have become one.

33:49.817 --> 33:53.853
Let us not to the marriage of true minds

33:53.888 --> 33:57.090
admit impediments. Love is not love

33:57.124 --> 34:00.760
which alters when it alteration finds,

34:00.795 --> 34:02.529
or bends with the...

34:02.563 --> 34:07.500
And as a very wise woman by the
name of Erma Bombeck once said...

34:08.835 --> 34:11.571
"Marriage has no guarantees.

34:11.605 --> 34:15.475
If that's what you're looking
for, go live with a car battery."

34:17.445 --> 34:19.145
I'm sorry.

34:23.984 --> 34:27.187
Stefanie Marie Foster.
You are a piece of work.

34:28.989 --> 34:31.224
But you're my piece of work.

34:31.257 --> 34:33.993
I accept you.

34:34.027 --> 34:36.795
Every single thing that
makes you who you are,

34:36.831 --> 34:41.000
from now until the end
of time... I love you.

34:41.034 --> 34:44.670
You're the person I've been
waiting for my whole life...

34:45.773 --> 34:49.775
And I am so proud

34:49.810 --> 34:51.744
to be standing up here

34:51.779 --> 34:54.313
in front of our friends and family

34:54.348 --> 34:58.551
to make sure they know just how
lucky I feel to have found you...

35:00.454 --> 35:02.455
and just how much I love you.

35:06.427 --> 35:08.228
May we have the rings, please?

35:13.200 --> 35:14.934
Thank you.

35:22.843 --> 35:24.611
Thank you.

35:38.409 --> 35:39.626
It's the wrong one.

35:43.197 --> 35:45.532
Never get that on my finger.

35:51.271 --> 35:53.039
Thank you.

35:55.342 --> 35:58.945
Well I think it's high time that
somebody kissed somebody, don't you think?

36:26.574 --> 36:29.475
- It's ok, mi amor.
- I know.

36:29.510 --> 36:33.646
But she's going to be devastated when
she finds out we aren't coming back.

36:39.253 --> 36:41.287
I'm sorry he didn't come.

36:43.240 --> 36:46.426
Me, too. For him. I'm sorry for him.

36:49.196 --> 36:53.233
Mike doesn't seem like
himself. It's not us, is it?

36:55.836 --> 36:58.738
No, it's not us.

37:04.878 --> 37:06.813
So, you're right.

37:06.847 --> 37:09.816
I've been selfish. I'm sorry.

37:11.652 --> 37:14.587
I'm not going to be selfish
anymore, ok? I promise.

37:19.410 --> 37:20.627
Excuse me, everybody.

37:23.230 --> 37:26.165
I want to dedicate this song to my moms.

37:27.401 --> 37:30.069
I hope you know how much I love you.

38:15.416 --> 38:18.384
"Man, that's gay" gets dropped on the daily
