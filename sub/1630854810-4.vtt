WEBVTT

00:25.483 --> 00:26.526
Marisol.

00:28.945 --> 00:29.779
Hello?

00:33.116 --> 00:33.950
<i>¿Mamá?</i>

00:38.496 --> 00:39.998
Ruben!

00:40.081 --> 00:43.043
Ruben! You okay? Daddy!

00:53.011 --> 00:54.721
I'm never gonna finish on time,

00:54.804 --> 00:58.433
and everything for Mom's memorial ceremony
needs to be perfect.

00:58.516 --> 01:00.268
Day of the Dead is the most important…

01:00.351 --> 01:01.978
…day of the year.

01:04.898 --> 01:06.316
Tastes more like dos leches.

01:06.399 --> 01:08.902
Thank you for helping with the cake,
but go work on the flowers.

01:08.985 --> 01:11.279
-Do you want them arranged a certain way?
-However you want.

01:13.073 --> 01:14.449
No, no, no! Not like that.

01:14.532 --> 01:16.159
-Maybe you can…

01:16.242 --> 01:18.078
…catch a ride to school with Rusty.

01:23.833 --> 01:25.668
Trash, meet the trash.

01:27.170 --> 01:28.004
Here.

01:29.464 --> 01:31.091
What is that?

01:31.174 --> 01:34.552
Homemade mystic mayo to keep all the evil
away until we can find this Mariluna.

01:34.636 --> 01:36.805
I don't want
any of those premonitions coming true.

01:36.888 --> 01:38.181
You're still on that?

01:38.264 --> 01:40.391
The premonition about the box came true.

01:40.475 --> 01:43.978
She said I was trying to solve something
that was broken, the curse.

01:44.062 --> 01:47.315
But in order to solve my problem,
something must be broken to be fixed,

01:47.398 --> 01:49.818
the box, which is where
I found that weird invitation.

01:49.901 --> 01:51.945
-You're reading into it too much.

01:52.028 --> 01:53.363
It's been five weeks.

01:53.446 --> 01:56.324
If we have a curse or a ghost,
then why am I getting a second shot

01:56.407 --> 01:58.660
at breaking the bent arm hang record?

01:58.743 --> 02:01.246
Shouldn't my life be falling apart,
not coming together?

02:01.329 --> 02:02.747
It's the calm before the storm.

02:02.831 --> 02:05.333
If ghosts are real, where was
the ghost last night on Halloween?

02:05.416 --> 02:08.169
-Halloween is offensive to ghosts.

02:08.253 --> 02:10.755
It was created by Hollywood
and candy corporations

02:10.839 --> 02:13.216
trying to push their agendas.
It's spiritual appropriation.

02:13.299 --> 02:16.386
-Whatever it is or was, it's gone.

02:16.970 --> 02:20.682
I can't spend time
talking about not real ghosts anymore.

02:20.765 --> 02:22.433
I have very real things to do.

02:22.517 --> 02:26.229
Right. You need to make things
for your dead ghost mother to enjoy.

02:26.312 --> 02:27.730
Exactly. It's tradition.

02:27.814 --> 02:29.566
-Okay, who is blowing you up?

02:29.649 --> 02:32.110
Andre. After bonding
over our Cam frustrations,

02:32.193 --> 02:35.738
we realized we both track our feelings
via numerology and moon phases.

02:35.822 --> 02:38.366
So, short story long,
I'm now his unofficial cohost.

02:39.450 --> 02:42.162
Shit. Podcast duty calls. I gotta go.

02:46.541 --> 02:48.168
Tonight, there's a waning moon,

02:48.251 --> 02:52.297
so I think today's podcast should focus
on releasing toxic energy and curses.

02:52.380 --> 02:54.674
And releasing relationship grudges
that no longer serve you.

02:54.757 --> 02:57.927
Yes, that's so waning moon. Love it.

02:58.011 --> 02:59.053
Love what?

02:59.137 --> 03:01.431
You. And today's podcast topic,

03:01.514 --> 03:03.391
releasing toxic energy.

03:03.474 --> 03:04.309
Oh, not for me.

03:04.392 --> 03:05.894
We're totally about you.

03:05.977 --> 03:07.937
Baby, this is the show
you should finally listen to

03:08.021 --> 03:10.523
so you can release that negativity
and hurt you're holding onto.

03:10.607 --> 03:13.526
I'm feeling better about my teacher
now that he wears underwear with shorts.

03:13.610 --> 03:16.696
What about that person you're hung up on
and scarred by? We can release them.

03:16.779 --> 03:18.615
Or you could talk about

03:18.698 --> 03:20.825
releasing your hang-up
on why you're so hung up on mine.

03:20.909 --> 03:24.162
-Tell Cam he needs to listen to the show.
-Cam should honor his truth.

03:24.245 --> 03:26.539
He's been fairly open
about how he doesn't support the arts.

03:26.623 --> 03:30.084
Fact. If I listen to your podcast,
I gotta go listen to someone's bad DJ set

03:30.168 --> 03:32.795
or see a friend of a friend's
terrible improv group.

03:32.879 --> 03:34.923
Next thing you know,
I'm booked Monday through Sunday.

03:35.006 --> 03:36.132
Let's lighten up on Cam.

03:36.216 --> 03:39.260
He's not as sensitive as us,
and that's okay.

03:39.969 --> 03:42.847
I'm not as sensitive?
You really wanna go there?

03:43.890 --> 03:48.102
Uh, actually,
where I wanna go right now is home,

03:48.186 --> 03:50.563
because I forgot my… Bye!

03:54.776 --> 03:57.070
Looks like she also forgot
the direction of her apartment.

03:57.695 --> 03:58.529
Yep.

03:59.614 --> 04:01.866
-What's up with you and Demi?
-Nothing.

04:03.201 --> 04:04.869
Well, maybe something.

04:04.953 --> 04:06.871
As a self-aware, natural avoider,

04:06.955 --> 04:09.207
I'm glad I don't have to have
the awkward convo with her,

04:09.290 --> 04:12.418
but knowing she's a boundary pusher,
I'm annoyed she's not pushing me.

04:17.340 --> 04:19.592
You see how her back is hella straight?

04:20.510 --> 04:23.137
See, I think you've been arching
your back too much when we practice.

04:23.221 --> 04:24.973
And that's probably throwing you off.

04:25.056 --> 04:28.434
But if I don't arch my back,
I'm not able to use my shoulders as much,

04:28.518 --> 04:30.436
and you know my traps
are stronger than my bi's.

04:30.520 --> 04:34.732
But maybe if I slightly utilized my tri's
and clenched my butt, that'll give me--

04:34.816 --> 04:37.360
You are overthinking.
Hey, don't overthink it.

04:37.443 --> 04:39.821
Agreed. When I overthink,
I loosen my grip.

04:40.822 --> 04:43.700
-I know the bent arm hang is stupid.
-Stop. It's not stupid.

04:43.783 --> 04:45.702
You are working
to be the best at something.

04:45.785 --> 04:49.330
And you're doing it for yourself.
Hey, that's what it's all about.

04:49.414 --> 04:51.874
I also want my props
and my picture in <i>The LA Times.</i>

04:52.458 --> 04:53.584
I think you can do it.

04:53.668 --> 04:55.837
I don't need your pep talk. I know I can.

04:55.920 --> 04:56.921
That's why I like you.

04:57.005 --> 04:58.006
What?

04:59.924 --> 05:02.468
Um, do you have a minute
to go over the grocery list

05:02.552 --> 05:04.804
that your father left for Tonio,
who left it for me?

05:05.305 --> 05:06.389
I'm hitting up Costco later,

05:06.472 --> 05:09.350
and there's a specialty item
that needs more, um,

05:10.101 --> 05:11.185
clarification.

05:11.728 --> 05:15.356
It, uh, deals
with stuff I don't deal with.

05:15.440 --> 05:17.900
Tampons. Fragrance-free and cardboard.

05:17.984 --> 05:21.112
I prefer plastic, but I care more
about the environment than my cooch.

05:22.739 --> 05:25.450
-Not that I don't care about my coo--
-No, got it. Thank you.

05:25.533 --> 05:27.660
Hey, if you're free tonight,

05:27.744 --> 05:29.662
you should come
to my boy's Day of the Dead party.

05:29.746 --> 05:30.747
He said bring a friend.

05:31.664 --> 05:33.166
So, we're friends now?

05:34.667 --> 05:35.501
Yeah.

05:36.586 --> 05:40.381
Um, and I do need you out of the house
from 6:30 to 10:00.

05:40.465 --> 05:42.258
Your uncle did rent it out to a film crew.

05:42.342 --> 05:43.968
Again? No, sorry.

05:44.052 --> 05:46.846
I can't go to the party,
but I'll be out of the house

05:46.929 --> 05:48.473
at the cemetery honoring my mom.

05:49.057 --> 05:51.392
It's an all-night thing,
but thanks for the invite.

05:59.400 --> 06:01.486
I'm so happy you got
AV room access at lunch,

06:01.569 --> 06:03.112
'cause I wanna help Gloria after school.

06:03.196 --> 06:04.614
Such a big day for her.

06:04.697 --> 06:07.367
And us!
I can't wait to talk about moon phases.

06:07.450 --> 06:09.827
And I can't wait to talk about
what you're avoiding.

06:10.661 --> 06:11.871
Ta-da!

06:11.954 --> 06:15.792
Today, Cam is our guest,
and we're gonna clear the air on the air.

06:19.712 --> 06:22.173
I have a great idea
for the graveside ceremony tonight.

06:22.256 --> 06:25.718
So, when we were going through Mom's stuff
in the garage a few weeks ago,

06:25.802 --> 06:28.137
I found that big box
of Precious Moments figurines

06:28.221 --> 06:29.055
that Mom loved.

06:29.138 --> 06:31.307
What if we bring 'em
and set 'em up all around her grave?

06:31.391 --> 06:35.686
I love that idea. I really do,
but Mom actually hated those figurines.

06:35.770 --> 06:37.522
But she had them all around the house.

06:37.605 --> 06:40.775
For Grandma. They were gifts from her.
Mom thought they were tacky.

06:40.858 --> 06:44.028
She also thought Grandma was tacky,
but don't tell Dad.

06:44.112 --> 06:45.363
Uh, okay.

06:45.446 --> 06:49.492
Uh, what if we go to our fave
Italian restaurant after the cemetery?

06:49.575 --> 06:50.743
Mom hated that place.

06:50.827 --> 06:53.746
It only became <i>our</i> favorite place
after she died.

06:53.830 --> 06:56.624
But keep up the ideas.
One will eventually land.

07:00.002 --> 07:02.338
It's about to be
a "Brand New Dre" for you two.

07:03.297 --> 07:04.924
Come on, it's a podcast.

07:05.633 --> 07:08.052
Okay, since no one can see
how uncomfortable you both are,

07:08.136 --> 07:09.303
I'll just set the scene.

07:09.387 --> 07:12.265
Cam looks clammy,
and Demi is a mix of distraught

07:12.348 --> 07:14.475
and on the verge of saying something
she's gonna regret.

07:14.559 --> 07:16.769
We only have
ten minutes left of lunch, so…

07:16.853 --> 07:18.813
Fine. Let's get off the topic
of your silence

07:18.896 --> 07:19.981
and on the topic of talking.

07:20.064 --> 07:22.442
Specifically talking about
what you're both avoiding.

07:22.525 --> 07:25.361
You know what I never avoid? Fabric!

07:26.988 --> 07:29.657
What? Who doesn't love fabric?
Fabric is the fabric of our lives.

07:29.740 --> 07:33.202
And the foundation for our aspirational
corporate sponsor, Freeridge Textiles.

07:33.286 --> 07:35.830
-They make fabrics to die for.

07:35.913 --> 07:36.998
All right, back to our show.

07:37.081 --> 07:39.625
So, our show today
is all about the waning moon

07:39.709 --> 07:42.753
and releasing relationship grudges
that no longer serve you.

07:43.254 --> 07:45.423
Cam, it's time we give you
an emotional facial.

07:45.506 --> 07:48.551
We gotta dig out that dirt
and cleanse the pores of your soul

07:48.634 --> 07:50.470
so you can love again.

07:51.053 --> 07:54.140
Baby, tell us what happened.
Who scarred you?

07:54.640 --> 07:56.893
I don't feel comfortable naming names.

07:56.976 --> 07:59.854
We're wasting time.
That situation was forever ago.

07:59.937 --> 08:02.815
Let's leave the past in the past.
It probably wasn't a big deal.

08:02.899 --> 08:04.650
It actually was a big deal.

08:04.734 --> 08:06.527
Mm, own your truth, baby.

08:08.154 --> 08:09.739
So this is what happened.

08:10.698 --> 08:13.784
When I was 12,
before I came out to my friends as bi,

08:13.868 --> 08:15.620
a friend that I was hung up on said

08:15.703 --> 08:19.373
she could never be with a guy
who had been with a guy.

08:19.457 --> 08:21.876
That biphobic bitch.

08:21.959 --> 08:25.004
And this friend
was someone you were in love with?

08:27.006 --> 08:29.008
-Yeah.
-Demi!

08:29.717 --> 08:32.512
You were friends with Cam back then.
Did you witness this?

08:32.595 --> 08:33.679
Oh yeah. She was there.

08:33.763 --> 08:36.182
Was I there? Because I don't remember.

08:36.265 --> 08:39.227
I would remember hearing that,
but I don't.

08:39.310 --> 08:40.937
-That's convenient.
-No, it's not.

08:41.020 --> 08:42.939
It's more like
I don't think anyone said that.

08:43.022 --> 08:44.440
-They did.
-I don't think they did.

08:44.524 --> 08:45.358
Okay, let's--

08:45.441 --> 08:48.653
I'm not trying to negate you, Cam,
but that didn't happen.

08:48.736 --> 08:50.404
Okay, well, no disrespect, Demi,

08:50.488 --> 08:52.281
but the comment
cut to the core of my identity.

08:52.365 --> 08:54.534
So I think my recollection
might be better than yours.

08:54.617 --> 08:55.868
-Agree to disagree.
-Okay.

08:55.952 --> 08:58.287
No, this is not a gray area.
It's black and white.

08:58.371 --> 08:59.497
Unlike sexuality.

08:59.580 --> 09:03.584
Which I agree with and why I'm contesting
this incident even happened.

09:03.668 --> 09:05.920
-Maybe you didn't hear it.
-Maybe I just don't believe it.

09:06.003 --> 09:07.463
It doesn't matter what you believe.

09:07.547 --> 09:10.424
This is what I experienced,
and you aren't respecting it.

09:11.467 --> 09:13.553
I guess this scar isn't ready to heal.

09:14.679 --> 09:19.100
Thanks for the uncomfortable conversation.
I hope it makes for a great show.

09:20.935 --> 09:22.186
Call you, babe.

09:22.812 --> 09:24.689
And that's our show.

09:41.664 --> 09:43.749
6:45 p.m.,
give or take a few minutes.

09:43.833 --> 09:45.751
We should be wrapping up
the year's updates

09:45.835 --> 09:48.546
and moving on to the duet
of Mom's favorite Depeche Mode song.

09:49.130 --> 09:52.466
Oh, I forgot to tell you.
The duet is actually no longer a duet.

09:52.550 --> 09:53.467
It's gonna be a solo

09:53.551 --> 09:56.971
since you have a track record of singing
too loud and forgetting the lyrics.

09:57.555 --> 10:00.683
I feel like this year might be the year
to honor Mom with your silence.

10:00.766 --> 10:03.060
Why don't I just honor her
with my absence?

10:03.144 --> 10:04.770
You wanna sit in the car?

10:04.854 --> 10:06.856
No, I'm not going.

10:07.607 --> 10:11.027
Rusty invited me to a party,
so I'm gonna go to that.

10:12.570 --> 10:15.781
-Oh. He invited you too?
-He actually invited me first.

10:15.865 --> 10:17.700
And now that you don't need me
for the ceremony,

10:17.783 --> 10:19.160
I'm definitely getting my party on.

10:19.243 --> 10:21.537
-Dad's never gonna let you.
-He already did.

10:21.621 --> 10:25.291
We were texting while you were going over
the prayers you're gonna say at 6:13 p.m.

10:25.374 --> 10:26.250
I'm calling Dad.

10:26.834 --> 10:29.337
-Gloria, everything okay?

10:29.420 --> 10:32.673
No. Did you tell Ines
she can go to a party

10:32.757 --> 10:34.342
instead of going to the cemetery tonight?

10:34.425 --> 10:37.803
-<i>Yes.</i>
-But we go together as a family.

10:37.887 --> 10:39.055
It's tradition.

10:39.138 --> 10:42.183
<i>Mi hijita</i>, I tried calling you earlier.
I'm at the cemetery now

10:42.266 --> 10:45.311
because I promised Lucia I'd go
to a charity event with her tonight.

10:45.394 --> 10:49.273
-Something she's worked on for months.
-Lucia? You're ditching me for Lucia?

10:49.357 --> 10:52.151
<i>Pero,</i> I didn't even know
the event was tonight until this morning.

10:52.234 --> 10:55.404
Go with Ines to the party if you want,
and we'll all go to the cemetery tomorrow.

10:55.488 --> 10:57.823
Going tomorrow
isn't even an option for me.

10:57.907 --> 11:01.410
You know, it's called Day of the Dead,
not Day After the Day of the Dead.

11:01.494 --> 11:03.954
Gloria, not going today
doesn't ruin the tradition.

11:04.038 --> 11:04.872
It does for me.

11:04.955 --> 11:07.583
If life has taught me anything,
it's that traditions can change.

11:07.667 --> 11:08.751
You should be open to that.

11:08.834 --> 11:11.587
Dad, the definition of tradition
is that it doesn't change.

11:11.671 --> 11:13.756
Are you a dummy? I mean, are you?

11:13.839 --> 11:17.218
I know you're very disappointed right now,
so I'm gonna disregard your disrespect.

11:17.802 --> 11:20.513
And are you a dummy? Are you?
'Cause you're talking to your dad.

11:20.596 --> 11:22.556
I might learn to forgive,
but I'll never forget.

11:22.640 --> 11:24.642
<i>Enjoy your sidepiece, Javi.</i>

11:24.725 --> 11:27.019
That's what I wanted to say to him,
but I didn't.

11:27.103 --> 11:28.688
That line deserves a live audience.

11:28.771 --> 11:30.981
Speaking of audiences,
I'm just letting you know

11:31.065 --> 11:34.402
I am so mad at Cam for the major shade
he threw at me on Andre's podcast.

11:34.485 --> 11:35.486
Shade about what?

11:35.569 --> 11:38.739
Cam's mad at me for something
I apparently said when I was 12.

11:38.823 --> 11:41.909
-I have no idea what he's talking about.
-What was said? Maybe I remember?

11:41.992 --> 11:43.077
I… uh…

11:43.577 --> 11:44.620
It's so silly.

11:44.704 --> 11:47.581
I don't even remember
what I don't remember. I mean, I was 12.

11:47.665 --> 11:50.668
What did I even know back then?
I'd never even seen porn.

11:53.045 --> 11:56.424
We need to know what you know
about my mother haunting you.

11:57.091 --> 11:58.050
What?

11:58.134 --> 12:00.678
We think we saw…
Granny… at the cemetery.

12:02.096 --> 12:06.016
Carrots and garlic
are good natural spirit cleansers.

12:06.100 --> 12:07.768
-Where did you learn that?
-Reddit.

12:07.852 --> 12:09.562
-Where did you read it?
-Reddit.

12:10.187 --> 12:11.230
I know. Where?

12:11.313 --> 12:12.606
I read it on Reddit.

12:12.690 --> 12:14.233
<i>¡Mira! </i>

12:14.316 --> 12:18.779
As you can see, this is an invitation,
but not just any invitation.

12:18.863 --> 12:22.324
It's a 50th <i>Lethal Weapon-</i>themed birthday.

12:22.408 --> 12:24.869
And after researching <i>Lethal Weapon,</i>

12:24.952 --> 12:26.787
I discovered it's a movie
about a cop on the--

12:26.871 --> 12:28.497
I know the movie.

12:28.581 --> 12:30.583
Well, it's clearly
something Mariluna loved,

12:30.666 --> 12:33.919
along with this guy Henry,
who she threw the party for.

12:34.003 --> 12:36.213
Look at this note
from Mariluna to Marisol.

12:36.297 --> 12:39.967
"Marisol, please come. I miss you."

12:40.551 --> 12:41.635
What do you think it means?

12:41.719 --> 12:46.098
I think my mom, Marisol, was invited,
and Mariluna missed her.

12:47.183 --> 12:48.309
But who is Mariluna?

12:48.392 --> 12:50.144
That is the question!

12:50.227 --> 12:53.773
Marisol. Mariluna. Sun. Moon.

12:53.856 --> 12:55.524
They're probably related.

12:55.608 --> 12:57.526
-My mother only had brothers.
-Are you sure?

12:57.610 --> 12:59.987
There was not a lot
I didn't know about my mom.

13:00.070 --> 13:01.155
She was a sharer.

13:01.238 --> 13:03.908
A lot of TMI in our house.

13:03.991 --> 13:06.368
Oh, so you know
she was in the Guerra Sucia?

13:07.703 --> 13:11.081
That is not public knowledge.
How did you know that?

13:11.165 --> 13:14.084
-Her memorial website.
-What memorial website?

13:16.086 --> 13:19.256
No, I had no idea
Jamal made this weird website.

13:19.340 --> 13:21.592
Do you think your son
had a secret romance with Marisol?

13:21.675 --> 13:22.968
-Maybe.
-Maybe.

13:23.052 --> 13:27.014
-My mother did not date a teenage boy.
-They were inappropriately close.

13:27.097 --> 13:29.099
-Best friends.
-That's pretty unconventional.

13:29.183 --> 13:33.562
Not for Jamal. The kid's got a lot of, uh,
strange hobbies and even stranger secrets.

13:35.231 --> 13:38.359
-He found the RollerWorld money.
-Bullshit. RollerWorld?

13:38.442 --> 13:40.027
There's no buried cash in our hood.

13:40.110 --> 13:41.821
It's real. And my kid found it.

13:41.904 --> 13:45.658
Excuse me, with help from his friends
and my mother-in-law.

13:45.741 --> 13:47.451
What did they do with all the money?

13:47.535 --> 13:51.413
According to Jamal, Marisol reburied it
for the kids to find again.

13:51.497 --> 13:54.041
And she left them a map.
A map that she embroidered.

13:57.711 --> 13:58.754
Like this?

13:58.838 --> 14:02.967
Yes, like that, but finished.
This one just gets you to CVS.

14:03.050 --> 14:06.345
-If Jamal and Marisol were hooking up--
-They were not hooking up!

14:06.428 --> 14:08.514
Whatever, touching with clothes on.

14:09.098 --> 14:11.600
I bet Jamal knows who Mariluna is.

14:12.434 --> 14:14.937
-Is there any way to talk to your son?
-There is.

14:15.563 --> 14:16.522
But it's

14:17.815 --> 14:18.691
annoying.

14:21.819 --> 14:25.573
No, honey, it's front, front, front,
side, back, side, front.

14:25.656 --> 14:26.740
That's what I'm doing.

14:26.824 --> 14:30.452
No, you're confusing the sides
and the front. You gotta turn it around.

14:30.536 --> 14:32.371
It's a cube. It's confusing.

14:32.454 --> 14:34.874
This is why it's so annoying
to get a hold of Jamal.

14:35.457 --> 14:38.836
He works for Noel Aroma, and apparently
phones don't work in the biosphere.

14:38.919 --> 14:40.004
Biodome.

14:40.087 --> 14:43.215
-Here. Take this before I crush it.
-It looks like you just did a triple side.

14:43.299 --> 14:44.592
No, that was a triple front.

14:44.675 --> 14:47.469
Are you sure? Because if you
turn it around, that's the back.

14:49.013 --> 14:49.847
Give it to me.

14:54.393 --> 14:56.228
-<i>Hello.</i>
-Jamal, honey?

14:56.312 --> 14:58.105
-<i>Mom.</i>
Why does he sound like a robot?

14:58.188 --> 15:02.192
<i>Because the yeti voice setting</i>
<i>is still in beta testing. Who are you?</i>

15:02.276 --> 15:04.904
Hi, I'm Demi. I just have a quick question

15:04.987 --> 15:07.072
that your parents are trying
to help me answer.

15:07.156 --> 15:10.951
Do you know a woman your late
ex-girlfriend Marisol knew named Mariluna?

15:11.035 --> 15:12.119
<i> No.</i>

15:12.202 --> 15:13.913
-Did Marisol have a sister?
-<i>Yes.</i>

15:13.996 --> 15:17.041
That cube is lying.
My mom did not have a sister.

15:17.124 --> 15:20.544
<i>Before she died,</i>
<i>Abuelita told me she had a twin.</i>

15:20.628 --> 15:23.714
That's why they look alike.
Marisol is Mariluna's twin.

15:23.797 --> 15:27.718
<i>I mean, Sun, Moon…</i>
<i>Make sense? Is that all?</i>

15:27.801 --> 15:31.138
One more question.
Jamal, did you date my mom?

15:31.221 --> 15:35.601
<i>Mr. Martinez, I am not going</i>
<i>to dignify that question with a response.</i>

15:35.684 --> 15:37.937
-That's a no, right?

15:38.604 --> 15:40.773
She's an evil twin.

15:41.273 --> 15:42.524
Surprise, surprise.

15:42.608 --> 15:46.528
The ghost I never really believed
was a ghost isn't a ghost,

15:46.612 --> 15:49.114
because, as I suspected,
it's a real person,

15:49.198 --> 15:52.159
hence proving that ghosts don't exist.

15:52.242 --> 15:54.828
Believers 0, Gloria 1.

15:54.912 --> 15:56.622
Why be an asshole about it?

15:56.705 --> 15:59.917
Because this is an extremely important day
for my family, Demi.

16:00.000 --> 16:02.002
I can't deal with this crap.

16:02.086 --> 16:04.213
Please don't insult me
by calling my stuff crap.

16:04.296 --> 16:06.215
I just don't understand
why you believe in it.

16:06.298 --> 16:10.260
You don't have to understand it. You just
have to respect it, which you don't.

16:12.554 --> 16:16.433
And I don't, because I've been doing
the same thing to Cam.

16:17.309 --> 16:19.019
Oh shit. I gotta go.

16:22.189 --> 16:24.358
-Change! Mom wouldn't like that outfit.

16:24.441 --> 16:26.652
Well, that doesn't matter,
because, A, she's dead,

16:26.735 --> 16:30.239
and, B, she won't see it because I'm still
not going to the cemetery tonight.

16:30.322 --> 16:32.783
You're still choosing a party over Mom?

16:32.866 --> 16:36.161
-No, I'm choosing a party over you.
-You are so selfish.

16:36.245 --> 16:39.873
You can't even spend one evening
focusing on someone other than you.

16:39.957 --> 16:43.711
No, <i>you </i>can't. If it's not on your terms,
then you can't be bothered.

16:43.794 --> 16:46.338
This is textbook baby sister victim shit.

16:46.422 --> 16:49.883
Yep, that's me, all right.
Once again, Gloria knows everything.

16:49.967 --> 16:52.678
I know everything because I do everything.

16:52.761 --> 16:54.263
Because you don't let me help.

16:54.346 --> 16:56.515
What you do is the opposite of help.

16:56.598 --> 16:59.935
I'm doing the best that I can!
What else do you want from me?

17:00.019 --> 17:01.353
I want you to be better

17:01.437 --> 17:06.150
and to maybe spend some time caring about
the incredible woman who birthed you.

17:09.194 --> 17:12.614
You may get to tell me
how to clean the kitchen or make a cake

17:12.698 --> 17:14.450
or who I can go to parties with,

17:14.950 --> 17:17.661
but you don't get to tell me
how to grieve my mom!

17:18.328 --> 17:19.830
I'm gonna wait outside for Rusty.

17:20.330 --> 17:22.750
Oh, now I get it.

17:23.250 --> 17:24.793
This is about Rusty.

17:24.877 --> 17:27.963
Oh my God!
This has nothing to do with Rusty!

17:28.047 --> 17:29.339
But since we're on the subject,

17:29.423 --> 17:31.675
just because you don't like him
doesn't mean that I can't.

17:31.759 --> 17:34.595
I don't not like him.
I actually do like him.

17:34.678 --> 17:38.640
I mean, he's not unpleasant to be around.
Like, he's not totally worthless.

17:40.350 --> 17:41.226
That's messed up.

17:41.310 --> 17:43.645
You're right.
He's actually not worthless at all.

17:43.729 --> 17:47.524
No, what's messed up is
that you've only known Rusty a few weeks,

17:47.608 --> 17:49.902
and you're giving him more credit
than you've ever given me.

17:52.738 --> 17:54.865
Ines, you're not going.

17:54.948 --> 17:56.116
Yes, I am.

17:56.784 --> 17:58.077
You're not my mother.

17:59.036 --> 18:03.207
So the ghost is actually the dead lady's
evil twin sister and not a ghost.

18:03.290 --> 18:05.292
-Crazy, right?
-Demi, why are you here?

18:05.375 --> 18:08.420
To share the big news
about the ghost slash not ghost.

18:08.504 --> 18:12.049
Great, it's been shared.
Now I need to attend to a breakup.

18:12.132 --> 18:13.675
You're breaking up with Andre tonight?

18:13.759 --> 18:17.179
No, not Andre.
Tonight's hometowns on <i>The Bachelor.</i>

18:19.139 --> 18:20.432
Andre and I are actually good.

18:21.350 --> 18:24.228
I turned a corner on him and realized
that he has a lot of great qualities

18:24.311 --> 18:27.481
that include not being a liar.

18:30.567 --> 18:31.443
Good night.

18:33.195 --> 18:34.321
It's cold out here.

18:37.074 --> 18:37.991
It's, like, 70 degrees.

18:38.075 --> 18:41.203
No, I mean,
it's cold on the outside of you.

18:42.830 --> 18:45.415
I want back in. So I'm sorry.

18:46.542 --> 18:48.252
You're sorry because you're uncomfortable?

18:48.335 --> 18:52.631
And I'm also sorry I'm not respecting
what we're disagreeing about.

18:53.715 --> 18:57.136
I'm really sorry that situation happened
to you and that you think I said it.

18:57.219 --> 19:00.222
I don't <i>think </i>that you said it.
I know you did.

19:00.305 --> 19:03.142
Cam, that's not something I would say.

19:03.684 --> 19:05.060
I don't even believe that.

19:05.144 --> 19:08.188
I don't find you any less attractive
because you're also with guys.

19:09.940 --> 19:11.233
I was 12.

19:11.316 --> 19:13.735
Like, what the hell
did I know about sexuality?

19:14.570 --> 19:19.116
I'm so sorry some dumb thing
I can't remember saying hurt you.

19:19.199 --> 19:20.576
The problem is it wasn't dumb.

19:21.827 --> 19:23.078
It was devastating.

19:25.122 --> 19:28.333
And now your apology isn't even about me.
It's about you.

19:29.543 --> 19:32.880
You don't like how uncomfortable you feel,
but imagine being me.

19:35.132 --> 19:36.550
You crushed me that day.

19:37.759 --> 19:41.013
And I've never been able to fully recover,
because that thing that you said,

19:41.096 --> 19:43.432
that you won't own,
made me question everything,

19:44.016 --> 19:47.603
my confidence, my self-esteem,
my best friend.

19:48.187 --> 19:51.148
-Why?
-Because you were supposed to be safe.

19:52.024 --> 19:53.942
And accepting. And you weren't.

19:54.026 --> 19:56.111
You made me feel like I was gross.

19:57.738 --> 19:58.697
Don't you get it?

19:59.531 --> 20:01.200
If you can't accept me for who I am,

20:01.283 --> 20:03.785
what chance do I have
that the rest of the world will?

20:12.502 --> 20:13.712
Fuck off, Demi.

20:30.229 --> 20:32.231
-Hey, have you seen Ines?
-Hm-mm.

20:32.314 --> 20:33.482
No.

20:33.565 --> 20:35.025
-What's up?
-Hey, what's up?

20:44.910 --> 20:46.036
You wanna go home?

20:47.621 --> 20:48.538
Yes.

20:50.290 --> 20:51.250
And no.

20:51.833 --> 20:55.879
I feel bad that I'm missing
my mom's graveside ceremony, but…

20:57.839 --> 20:59.967
I'm so pissed at Gloria,

21:01.176 --> 21:03.262
because she thinks
that today is only important to her,

21:03.345 --> 21:06.056
but it's actually
really important to me too.

21:06.765 --> 21:09.268
-Well, did you tell her?
-There's no point.

21:10.352 --> 21:12.229
She doesn't listen, and she won't get it.

21:12.813 --> 21:13.981
Hey, I'm listening.

21:16.900 --> 21:19.778
It's not that I don't want
to think about my mom.

21:20.362 --> 21:21.863
I think about her every day.

21:21.947 --> 21:26.910
It's just this whole day
is about remembering her, and I…

21:28.328 --> 21:29.162
I don't.

21:29.746 --> 21:33.625
And it kills me trying to figure out
the things that she would love today.

21:33.709 --> 21:35.877
Like, her favorite flowers
and taste in restaurants.

21:35.961 --> 21:39.464
And then being reminded
that I have no idea.

21:40.048 --> 21:40.966
My own mom.

21:42.175 --> 21:43.510
I don't remember her.

21:46.346 --> 21:48.432
And I hate how mean I was to Gloria.

21:48.932 --> 21:50.517
I mean, I always am.

21:52.728 --> 21:53.687
And she's right.

21:55.314 --> 21:56.732
I'm not helpful.

21:56.815 --> 21:59.568
I even forgot to put sugar
in the tres leches.

22:00.902 --> 22:02.904
Gloria just wants me to be better.

22:04.614 --> 22:05.907
And I wanna be.

22:07.659 --> 22:09.036
I just don't know how.

22:10.912 --> 22:11.788
Hey.

22:13.332 --> 22:16.543
All that matters is that you keep trying.

22:31.516 --> 22:34.936
Well, that was supposed to be when
Ines body rolls and throws it back to me,

22:35.020 --> 22:36.188
but it's all good.

22:36.271 --> 22:39.483
We're a little off schedule,
but I'm feeling really good about life

22:39.566 --> 22:41.485
and how things are going. Whoo!

22:48.700 --> 22:51.995
I can't lie to you, Mom.
Everything is crap.

22:57.793 --> 23:00.921
Dad is dating a new woman

23:01.004 --> 23:03.340
and not making time
for the things he used to,

23:03.423 --> 23:05.592
which could be the cancer talking.

23:05.675 --> 23:08.470
And cancer!
That's some scary shit right there.

23:08.553 --> 23:11.223
I pretend to be all brave,
but I am terrified.

23:11.306 --> 23:14.684
I mean, what if we lose Dad?
I barely survived losing you.

23:14.768 --> 23:17.729
I don't think I could handle
all the responsibility,

23:17.813 --> 23:23.068
especially now that Ines has found
a true calling as a pain in my ass.

23:30.742 --> 23:32.119
I'm tired.

23:33.203 --> 23:35.372
And I'm tired of being tired.

23:37.207 --> 23:40.168
I just wanna be a kid again.

23:40.252 --> 23:42.879
A kid for once.

23:43.964 --> 23:48.301
I need you, Mom, and you're not here.

23:50.470 --> 23:51.513
I'm here.

23:55.392 --> 23:56.226
<i>¿Mamá?</i>

23:56.309 --> 24:00.730
Oh, Glo, I'm so sorry I'm not there
to hold you and remind you

24:00.814 --> 24:03.150
that you are my brave, strong girl.

24:04.568 --> 24:09.865
I don't feel very brave
or strong right now.

24:09.948 --> 24:11.741
But you are… …my love.

24:12.325 --> 24:16.037
No, I'm barely holding it together,

24:16.663 --> 24:20.792
and I have all this anger in my heart

24:20.876 --> 24:26.298
towards Dad and Ines and you for dying.

24:26.381 --> 24:27.549
That's okay.

24:27.632 --> 24:31.470
Those feelings are normal.
Don't be so hard on yourself.

24:31.553 --> 24:34.014
I'm failing with Ines.

24:34.598 --> 24:38.101
She's so disrespectful
and unappreciative--

24:38.185 --> 24:41.438
And maybe so are you?

24:41.521 --> 24:42.522
What?

24:42.606 --> 24:47.027
You need to stop being her mother
and start being her sister.

24:47.611 --> 24:50.614
Find ways to like her
as much as you love her.

24:51.907 --> 24:53.450
Try being her friend.

24:54.367 --> 24:55.827
Maybe she'll become yours.

24:57.871 --> 24:58.747
How?

24:59.247 --> 25:02.918
-How can I do this without you?
-I'm always with you, baby.

25:04.169 --> 25:05.712
You just have to believe.

25:08.131 --> 25:09.132
But I don't.

25:09.799 --> 25:11.134
Then why am I here?

25:12.469 --> 25:13.762
Gloria?

25:24.606 --> 25:25.524
You good?

25:26.274 --> 25:27.108
Why are you here?

25:27.692 --> 25:29.903
When I dropped your sister off,
you weren't home.

25:29.986 --> 25:32.948
I, uh, came to see if you were okay?

25:40.705 --> 25:41.581
I will be.

26:28.920 --> 26:31.548
One sister will be
the downfall of the other.

26:32.507 --> 26:34.009
Someone's gonna die.
