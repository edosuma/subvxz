WEBVTT

00:02.168 --> 00:03.420
{\an8}- MIKE! MIKE!

00:03.503 --> 00:04.921
{\an8}- THERE'S THREE CRAZY GIRLS
IN THE FRONT RIGHT NOW.

00:05.004 --> 00:07.382
{\an8}- MIKE BROUGHT HOME
THESE CREATURES

00:07.465 --> 00:08.925
{\an8}THAT HE DIDN'T
WANT TO HANG OUT WITH.

00:09.008 --> 00:10.135
{\an8}SO WHEN
I TELL 'EM TO LEAVE,

00:10.218 --> 00:11.553
{\an8}THIS ONE GIRL STARTS
CHARGING ME

00:11.636 --> 00:12.762
{\an8}LIKE A [bleep] HIPPO.

00:12.846 --> 00:15.682
{\an8}[overlapping shouts]

00:15.765 --> 00:17.183
{\an8}- YO, YO, YO!

00:17.267 --> 00:18.601
{\an8}- NOW MY FACE
IS [bleep] UP AGAIN.

00:18.685 --> 00:20.019
{\an8}I AM DONE WITH MIKE'S [bleep].

00:20.103 --> 00:22.188
{\an8}I AM DONE WITH HIM
BRINGING THESE GIRLS HERE.

00:22.272 --> 00:23.982
{\an8}- THIS IS VINNY.
THAT'S MY SISTER.

00:24.065 --> 00:25.191
{\an8}- HI.
- HI.

00:25.275 --> 00:25.900
{\an8}- I BEEN TALKIN'
TO THE SITUATION'S SISTER.

00:25.984 --> 00:28.153
{\an8}SHE'S A CUTE GIRL,

00:28.236 --> 00:31.072
{\an8}AND SHE GREW ON ME
A LITTLE BIT.

00:31.156 --> 00:33.199
{\an8}- VINNY KNOWS
NOT TO PUSH IT TOO FAR,

00:33.283 --> 00:35.034
{\an8}OR I'M GONNA THROW HIM
IN MY TRUNK.

00:35.118 --> 00:36.745
{\an8}- EVERYONE'S HAVING
A GOOD TIME,

00:36.828 --> 00:39.247
{\an8}AND I SEE SAMMI AND RONNIE
ONCE AGAIN SECLUDED,

00:39.330 --> 00:41.249
{\an8}AND IT'S REALLY, LIKE,
GETTING TO ME.

00:41.332 --> 00:42.876
{\an8}YOU AND RONNIE
NEED TO LIVE IT UP.

00:42.959 --> 00:44.419
{\an8}HONESTLY,
THAT'S HOW WE ALL FEEL.

00:44.502 --> 00:45.545
{\an8}WE TALKED ABOUT IT.

00:45.628 --> 00:46.629
{\an8}- SNOOKI SAYS THAT
EVERYBODY IN THE HOUSE

00:46.713 --> 00:47.714
{\an8}THINKS THAT ME AND RONNIE
DON'T GO OUT,

00:47.797 --> 00:49.799
{\an8}WHICH IS NOT TRUE AT ALL.

00:49.883 --> 00:51.801
{\an8}THAT PISSES ME OFF.
I'M ALWAYS OUT.

00:51.885 --> 00:53.970
{\an8}- WE JUST ALL NEED TO HAVE,
LIKE, A FAMILY MEETING

00:54.053 --> 00:56.389
{\an8}AND SAY WHAT THE [bleep]
WE WANT TO SAY.

00:58.183 --> 01:00.059
{\an8}- I'M NOT FROM STATEN ISLAND,
BRO, ACTUALLY.

01:00.143 --> 01:01.644
{\an8}I KNEW THAT THE GUY
WANTED TO FIGHT,

01:01.728 --> 01:03.480
{\an8}AND SAMMI WAS JUST, LIKE,
ANTAGONIZING IT.

01:03.563 --> 01:04.647
{\an8}- WHAT'S WRONG?
- STOP!

01:04.730 --> 01:07.567
{\an8}- FIRST OF ALL,
IF YOUR [bleep]--

01:07.650 --> 01:09.068
{\an8}WHEN RONNIE PUSHED ME,
IT JUST WENT DOWNHILL.

01:09.152 --> 01:12.447
{\an8}- [indistinct] [bleep]!

01:12.530 --> 01:14.282
{\an8}- RONNIE JUST GOT
INTO A FIGHT ON THE BOARDWALK?

01:14.365 --> 01:15.325
{\an8}- COME ON.
- HELP!

01:15.408 --> 01:16.826
{\an8}- WHAT HAPPENED?

01:16.910 --> 01:17.660
{\an8}RONNIE LOOKS [bleep]ED UP.
HIS EYE'S SWOLLEN.

01:17.744 --> 01:19.662
{\an8}- WHERE'S SAM?

01:19.746 --> 01:20.622
{\an8}- I DON'T GIVE A [bleep].

01:20.705 --> 01:22.540
{\an8}- RONNIE, STOP!

01:22.624 --> 01:24.000
{\an8}APPARENTLY, I CAUSED THIS,

01:24.083 --> 01:25.335
{\an8}WHISH IS [bleep],
'CAUSE I DIDN'T.

01:25.418 --> 01:26.294
{\an8}[tearfully]
YOU JUST TRAUMATIZED ME.

01:39.224 --> 01:40.058
{\an8}- I DON'T CARE?

01:40.141 --> 01:40.517
{\an8}DID YOU JUST SEE
WHAT I DO FOR YOU?

01:40.600 --> 01:42.435
{\an8}LOOK AT MY FACE.

01:42.519 --> 01:43.686
{\an8}I DID NOT MEAN
TO PUSH YOU, SAM.

01:43.770 --> 01:46.981
{\an8}- NO MAN WILL EVER
TOUCH ME LIKE THAT EVER TWICE.

01:47.065 --> 01:49.359
{\an8}- BUT WHY--
- YOU KNOW WHAT?

01:49.442 --> 01:51.486
{\an8}- WHY DID YOU HAVE TO SAY
SOMETHING TO HIM?

01:51.569 --> 01:53.029
{\an8}- I AM SORRY YOUR FACE
LOOKS LIKE THIS.

01:53.112 --> 01:54.489
{\an8}I WILL NEVER BE TOUCHED

01:54.572 --> 01:56.366
{\an8}THE WAY I WAS TOUCHED
TONIGHT EVER.

01:56.449 --> 01:57.992
{\an8}WHY DO YOU THINK
I WALKED AWAY?

01:58.076 --> 01:59.452
{\an8}YOU PUSHED ME.

01:59.536 --> 02:01.538
{\an8}- I'M SORRY I TOUCHED YOU.

02:01.621 --> 02:04.624
{\an8}- I'M SORRY.

02:04.707 --> 02:05.750
{\an8}- I'M SORRY, TOO.

02:05.834 --> 02:07.335
{\an8}I NEVER MEANT
TO TOUCH YOU, SAM.

02:07.418 --> 02:08.586
{\an8}- I FORGAVE RONNIE,

02:08.669 --> 02:11.047
{\an8}AND IF HE WANTS TO PUNCH
SOMEBODY THEN PUNCH SOMEBODY,

02:11.131 --> 02:12.423
{\an8}AS LONG AS IT'S NOT ME.

02:13.842 --> 02:16.010
{\an8}- ARE YOU ALL RIGHT, GIRL?

02:16.094 --> 02:17.762
{\an8}- YEAH.
- OH, MY GOD.

02:17.846 --> 02:19.681
{\an8}- ADMITTEDLY,
IT WAS THAT BASTARD

02:19.764 --> 02:21.683
{\an8}IN THE [bleep] BAR,
AND I WENT OFF.

02:21.766 --> 02:23.309
{\an8}- THAT'S WHY I ALWAYS
TRY TO HAVE EVERYBODY

02:23.393 --> 02:25.144
{\an8}STAY TOGETHER IF WE CAN,
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

02:25.228 --> 02:27.397
{\an8}I WOULD NEVER THOUGHT
YOU AND SAM

02:27.480 --> 02:29.858
{\an8}WOULD HAVE GOT INTO A FIGHT
WITH ANOTHER COUPLE.

02:29.941 --> 02:31.317
{\an8}- 30 YEARS OLD.
30-YEAR-OLD COUPLE, BRO.

02:31.401 --> 02:32.944
{\an8}- LET ME TELL YOU
ONE MORE THING.

02:33.027 --> 02:35.029
{\an8}IS THERE A PROBLEM, LIKE,
ME HANGING OUT WITH RONNIE?

02:35.113 --> 02:37.407
{\an8}- IS THERE A PROBLEM?
- NO.

02:37.490 --> 02:40.159
{\an8}- 'CAUSE SNOOK SAID THAT
WE NEED A FAMILY MEETING

02:40.243 --> 02:42.370
{\an8}BECAUSE PEOPLE IN THIS HOUSE

02:42.453 --> 02:44.247
{\an8}FEEL LIKE ME AND RONNIE
DON'T GO OUT,

02:44.330 --> 02:45.540
{\an8}AND WE HANG OUT TOGETHER.

02:45.623 --> 02:46.916
{\an8}APPARENTLY, I'M
UNDER THE IMPRESSION

02:47.000 --> 02:47.917
{\an8}EVERYBODY IN THIS HOUSE

02:48.001 --> 02:49.252
{\an8}HAS SOMETHING WRONG
WITH ME AND RONNIE.

02:49.335 --> 02:50.378
{\an8}- FROM WHO?

02:50.461 --> 02:51.421
{\an8}- SNICK IS TELLING ME
EVERYBODY IN THIS HOUSE

02:51.504 --> 02:53.214
{\an8}GOT A PROBLEM
WITH ME AND RONNIE.

02:53.298 --> 02:54.924
{\an8}IS THERE A PROBLEM?

02:55.008 --> 02:57.844
{\an8}- ALL RIGHT, I'M GONNA
BE HONEST WITH YOU RIGHT NOW.

02:57.927 --> 03:00.388
{\an8}THE ONLY THING WE CARE ABOUT
IS GETTIN' GIRLS.

03:00.471 --> 03:02.223
{\an8}GETTIN' GIRLS
AND GOIN' TO THE GYM.

03:02.307 --> 03:03.266
{\an8}- [laughs]

03:03.349 --> 03:05.476
{\an8}EVERYBODY'S LIKE,
"I HAVE NO PROBLEMS."

03:05.560 --> 03:07.729
{\an8}SO I'M KINDA LIKE,
"WHAT'S GOIN' ON HERE?"

03:07.812 --> 03:08.938
{\an8}- I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW

03:09.022 --> 03:10.440
{\an8}WHO THE [bleep]
IS TALKIN' [bleep].

03:10.523 --> 03:12.734
{\an8}- THERE IS NO WAY I WAS GOIN'
TO SLEEP THAT NIGHT

03:12.817 --> 03:13.443
{\an8}WITHOUT HEARIN'
FROM SNOOKI.

03:13.526 --> 03:15.111
{\an8}- FAMILY MEETING, SNICK.

03:15.194 --> 03:16.905
{\an8}REMEMBER YOU WANTED
TO HAVE IT, WE'RE HAVIN' IT.

03:16.988 --> 03:19.073
{\an8}- I HAVE A FAMILY MEETING
RIGHT NOW.

03:19.157 --> 03:21.284
{\an8}- COME ON, SNICK, BEFORE I YANK
THE [bleep] DUCK OUT THE WALL.

03:25.705 --> 03:26.915
{\an8}WHO'S SAYIN'
THAT THEY HAVE A PROBLEM

03:26.998 --> 03:29.334
{\an8}WITH ME AND SAM, LIKE.

03:33.212 --> 03:34.964
{\an8}- I DIDN'T SAY EVERYBODY.
I DIDN'T SAY EVERYBODY.

03:35.048 --> 03:36.174
{\an8}- YES, YOU DID!

03:36.257 --> 03:37.258
{\an8}- YOU SAID HALF THE HOUSE.

03:37.342 --> 03:38.635
{\an8}SO HALF THE HOUSE
IS SLEEPING.

03:38.718 --> 03:39.928
{\an8}SO IS IT J.LO?

03:40.011 --> 03:41.137
{\an8}- WE WANT TO HANG OUT
WITH EVERYBODY.

03:41.220 --> 03:42.388
{\an8}IT'S THE LAST, LIKE,
TWO WEEKS.

03:42.472 --> 03:45.141
{\an8}WE FEEL LIKE EVERYONE'S
[bleep] WIMPING OUT.

03:45.224 --> 03:46.768
{\an8}- WHO'S WE, THOUGH?
WHO'S WE?

03:46.851 --> 03:47.810
{\an8}- EVERYONE IN THE HOUSE.

03:47.894 --> 03:49.312
{\an8}LIKE, YOU TWO
ARE HANGING OUT,

03:49.395 --> 03:50.647
{\an8}LIKE, VIN'S ALONE,

03:50.730 --> 03:51.981
{\an8}ME AND J.
AND, LIKE, YOU TWO.

03:52.065 --> 03:53.024
{\an8}- SO IT'S YOU AND J.?

03:53.107 --> 03:55.068
{\an8}- THERE'S ONLY--
WE'RE JUST SAYING--

03:55.151 --> 03:56.319
{\an8}LIKE, WE'RE NOT TALKING--
SHUT THE [bleep] UP.

03:56.402 --> 03:58.488
{\an8}WE'RE NOT TALKING
ABOUT ANYBODY.

03:58.571 --> 04:00.490
{\an8}WE'RE JUST SAYING THERE'S
TWO MORE WEEKS.

04:00.573 --> 04:01.824
{\an8}WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?

04:01.908 --> 04:03.368
{\an8}WE DON'T WANT TO BREAK UP
ANYMORE.

04:03.451 --> 04:05.328
{\an8}WE ALL WANT EVERYONE
TO HANG OUT TOGETHER.

04:05.411 --> 04:06.329
{\an8}- THAT'S UNDERSTANDABLE,

04:06.412 --> 04:08.122
{\an8}AND SAM TOOK IT
OUT OF CONTEXT

04:08.206 --> 04:10.124
{\an8}AND WAS MAD
AT ME AND PAULY.

04:10.208 --> 04:11.209
{\an8}- I'D COME TO THE CONCLUSION

04:11.292 --> 04:12.585
{\an8}MY ROOMMATES
ARE TALKIN' [bleep].

04:12.669 --> 04:13.753
{\an8}- JEN FEELS THE SAME WAY.

04:13.836 --> 04:15.004
{\an8}LIKE, WE TALKED
ABOUT IT.

04:15.088 --> 04:16.505
{\an8}ALL RIGHT, SO NEXT TIME
I HAVE A MEETING,

04:16.589 --> 04:18.091
{\an8}I'LL SAY ME AND JEN
FEEL THIS WAY.

04:18.173 --> 04:19.425
{\an8}- YOU SHOULD HAVE
SAID IT BEFORE.

04:19.509 --> 04:20.802
{\an8}- 'CAUSE YOU [bleep] TOLD ME
EVERYBODY IN THIS HOUSE

04:20.885 --> 04:22.303
{\an8}WAS TALKING ABOUT ME
AND HATED ME.

04:22.387 --> 04:24.138
{\an8}- I WAS KIND OF GETTING,
LIKE, ANNOYED WITH SAMMI,

04:24.222 --> 04:26.474
{\an8}BECAUSE, LIKE, THE WAY, LIKE,
SHE, LIKE, TALKS SOMETIMES,

04:26.557 --> 04:28.476
{\an8}LIKE, SHE CAN BE
A REAL BITCH,

04:28.559 --> 04:29.811
{\an8}AND SHE DOESN'T EVEN,
LIKE, REALIZE IT.

04:29.894 --> 04:31.354
{\an8}IT'S LIKE I WANT TO
[bleep] HANG OUT WITH YOU,

04:31.437 --> 04:33.147
{\an8}AND IF YOU'RE GONNA BE PISSED
OFF AT THE FACT

04:33.231 --> 04:34.023
{\an8}THAT I'M PISSED OFF
THAT YOU GUYS LEAVE, SO BE IT.

04:34.107 --> 04:36.526
{\an8}- WE'RE NOT PISSED OFF.

04:36.609 --> 04:37.902
{\an8}- WHEN YOU SAY [bleep]
LIKE THAT,

04:37.986 --> 04:38.486
{\an8}YOU'RE STARTIN' A COMMOTION,

04:38.569 --> 04:40.279
{\an8}LIKE, THEN JUST SAY,

04:40.363 --> 04:40.780
{\an8}YOU KNOW, MAYBE WE SHOULD ALL
START HANGIN' OUT MORE.

04:40.863 --> 04:42.657
{\an8}DON'T BE, LIKE,

04:42.740 --> 04:43.866
{\an8}"PEOPLE IN THE HOUSE THINK
THAT..."

04:43.950 --> 04:44.993
{\an8}- LIKE I CAN'T [bleep] JUGGLE

04:45.076 --> 04:45.785
{\an8}EVERYONE
IN THIS [bleep] HOUSE!

04:45.868 --> 04:46.995
{\an8}I AM NOT USED TO THIS
AT ALL!

04:47.078 --> 04:49.497
{\an8}I'M NOT USED TO IT.

04:49.580 --> 04:52.375
{\an8}- NO ONE'S YELLING AT YOU.
NO ONE'S PUTTIN' YOU DOWN.

04:52.458 --> 04:53.918
{\an8}- THIS IS CRAZY.

05:08.307 --> 05:09.350
{\an8}- I SAY LET'S HATE
THEM, TOO.

05:13.396 --> 05:15.189
{\an8}I THINK SNOOKI
OR JENNI'S JEALOUS.

05:15.273 --> 05:17.233
{\an8}'CAUSE I HANG OUT WITH RONNIE
AND HAVE A GOOD THING GOING.

05:17.316 --> 05:18.359
{\an8}JUST GIRL DRAMA
THAT I DON'T EVEN LIKE,

05:18.443 --> 05:20.570
{\an8}THAT I DON'T EVEN INVOLVE
MYSELF IN.

05:22.780 --> 05:24.657
{\an8}- IT WAS JUST LIKE, YOU KNOW,
I GET UP IN THE MORNING,

05:24.741 --> 05:25.700
{\an8}AND I CONFRONT J.LO
IN THE BACK.

05:25.783 --> 05:28.244
{\an8}YO, SNICK IS JUST
SAYIN' THAT

05:28.327 --> 05:29.245
{\an8}EVERYONE'S GOT A PROBLEM
WITH ME AND SAM

05:29.328 --> 05:30.413
{\an8}SPENDIN' SO MUCH TIME
TOGETHER,

05:30.496 --> 05:32.206
{\an8}AND EVERYONE IN THE HOUSE
IS GETTIN' MAD.

05:32.290 --> 05:34.250
{\an8}SHE'S LIKE,
"WHO SAID IT?"

05:34.334 --> 05:35.585
{\an8}AND THEN SHE WAS LIKE,

05:35.668 --> 05:37.253
{\an8}"WELL, THE ONLY PEOPLE
THAT WOULD SAY IT IS EITHER MIKE

05:37.336 --> 05:38.588
{\an8}AND, YOU KNOW,
OR [bleep] JENNI,

05:38.671 --> 05:39.922
{\an8}BECAUSE, YOU KNOW,
PAULY DOESN'T TALK.

05:40.006 --> 05:41.591
{\an8}- I'M GLAD SNOOKI
DID WHAT SHE DID.

05:41.674 --> 05:44.260
{\an8}RON DID A 180
BEING WITH SAM.

05:44.343 --> 05:46.554
{\an8}AND I THINK SAM JUST, LIKE,
DRILLS IT IN HIS HEAD,

05:46.637 --> 05:48.389
{\an8}"ME, ME, ME, ME, ME,"
LIKE ABOUT ME.

05:48.473 --> 05:50.892
{\an8}'CAUSE THE FIRST TWO WEEKS,
ME AND RON WERE COOL AS [bleep].

05:50.975 --> 05:52.602
{\an8}SHE TOLD ME
WE NEED A FAMILY MEETING,

05:52.685 --> 05:54.604
{\an8}BUT I TOLD HER LAST NIGHT,
WALKING HOME, I SAID,

05:54.687 --> 05:57.648
{\an8}"WE SHOULD BE ABLE
TO DO OUR OWN THING."

05:57.732 --> 05:59.233
{\an8}YOU TWO ARE A COUPLE.
WHO CARES?

05:59.317 --> 06:01.360
{\an8}- SO SNICK WAS STIRRING
[bleep] UP, MAN.

06:01.444 --> 06:03.780
{\an8}- ALL SHE SAID WAS,
"WE NEED A FAMILY MEETING.

06:03.863 --> 06:04.906
{\an8}WE NEED A FAMILY MEETING."

06:04.989 --> 06:06.157
{\an8}- ALL RIGHT,
SO IT'S HER THEN.

06:06.240 --> 06:07.909
{\an8}I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE
OF THAT, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

06:07.992 --> 06:08.993
{\an8}AND IT WAS SNICKERS
THE WHOLE TIME,

06:09.077 --> 06:11.579
{\an8}JUST HER DRUNK ASS
JUST CAUSING PROBLEMS.

06:17.585 --> 06:18.753
{\an8}- I DON'T CONFIDE IN NOBODY.

06:18.836 --> 06:21.130
{\an8}JENNI AND SNOOK
ARE ACTING SHADY.

06:21.214 --> 06:22.423
{\an8}I DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S GOING ON,

06:22.507 --> 06:24.050
{\an8}BUT IT'S LIKE,
"DON'T PLAY GAMES WITH ME."

06:27.970 --> 06:29.013
{\an8}AT ALL.

06:33.518 --> 06:35.812
{\an8}- SAM?
- YEAH, I'M UP HERE.

06:35.895 --> 06:38.606
{\an8}- I'M SO SORRY IF I MADE YOU
UPSET LAST NIGHT.

06:38.689 --> 06:39.565
{\an8}- IT'S OKAY.

06:39.649 --> 06:40.817
{\an8}- LIKE, YOU UNDERSTAND.

06:40.900 --> 06:42.276
{\an8}I REALIZE THAT WE
HAVE TWO WEEKS LEFT.

06:42.360 --> 06:44.153
{\an8}I JUST WANT
EVERYONE TO HANG OUT.

06:44.237 --> 06:46.197
{\an8}- IT WAS KIND OF LIKE YOU AND
JENNI WERE THE ONLY TWO LEFT.

06:46.280 --> 06:47.615
{\an8}YOU GUYS WERE TALKIN'
MAD [bleep].

06:47.698 --> 06:50.159
{\an8}- NO, IT STARTED LIKE--
WE DON'T TALK [bleep].

06:50.243 --> 06:51.494
{\an8}ALL I WANTED TO SAY
TO SAMMI AND RONNIE

06:51.577 --> 06:54.288
{\an8}WAS, YOU KNOW, WE ONLY HAVE
A COUPLE OF WEEKS LEFT,

06:54.372 --> 06:55.957
{\an8}AND I WANT TO HANG OUT
WITH YOU GUYS--THAT'S ALL.

06:56.040 --> 06:58.000
{\an8}AND I GUESS I SAID
THE WRONG [bleep].

06:58.084 --> 06:58.835
{\an8}WE'RE JUST SAYING, LIKE--

06:58.918 --> 07:00.336
{\an8}- ME, YOU, AND JENNI
SHOULD TALK.

07:00.419 --> 07:03.631
{\an8}LIKE, HONESTLY,
LET'S--ALL THREE OF US.

07:03.714 --> 07:04.924

{\an8}PRETTY MUCH I WAS, LIKE,
ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO DOWN

07:06.384 --> 07:07.760
{\an8}AND SAY IT
IN FRONT OF JENNI, TOO.

07:07.844 --> 07:08.511
{\an8}DON'T JUST SAY IT
IN FRONT OF ME.

07:08.594 --> 07:10.346
{\an8}I DON'T TRUST ANYBODY.

07:10.429 --> 07:11.180
{\an8}LIKE, YOU HAVE TO
GAIN YOUR TRUST WITH ME.

07:11.264 --> 07:12.807
{\an8}YOU DON'T JUST GET IT.

07:12.890 --> 07:15.643
{\an8}- I'M JUST FREAKIN' OUT
'CAUSE WE HAVE TWO WEEKS.

07:15.726 --> 07:17.979
{\an8}I'M STARTING TO, LIKE,
REALLY LOVE ALL OF YOU,

07:18.062 --> 07:19.021
{\an8}AND I JUST WANT TO,
LIKE, HANG OUT.

07:19.105 --> 07:20.648
{\an8}YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

07:20.731 --> 07:22.608
{\an8}IF I SAID IT THE WRONG WAY,
MADE YOU UPSET, I'M SORRY.

07:22.692 --> 07:24.193
{\an8}- YOU DID.
I WAS FUMING.

07:24.277 --> 07:25.194
{\an8}- I'M SORRY.

07:25.278 --> 07:27.530
{\an8}I JUST FEEL LIKE THEM LEAVING
ALL THE TIME

07:27.613 --> 07:28.739
{\an8}AND JUST BEING TOGETHER

07:28.823 --> 07:31.033
{\an8}THAT THEY'RE MISSING
THIS WHOLE EXPERIENCE.

07:31.117 --> 07:33.244
{\an8}LIKE, I UNDERSTAND
YOU LIKE EACH OTHER,

07:33.327 --> 07:35.037
{\an8}BUT FOR NOW,
HANG OUT WITH THE WHOLE GROUP

07:35.121 --> 07:36.372
{\an8}AND LET'S JUST GO WILD.

07:36.455 --> 07:38.082
{\an8}LIKE, LET'S JUST
BLOW IT OUT OF THE WATER.

07:38.166 --> 07:39.876
{\an8}- YOU WERE SAYING [bleep]
ABOUT JENNI, LIKE,

07:39.959 --> 07:41.878
{\an8}WHEN IT WASN'T
EVEN LIKE...

07:41.961 --> 07:44.297
{\an8}"WE NEED FAMILY MEETING"?
WHAT IS THIS?

07:44.380 --> 07:45.548
{\an8}- NO, I JUST WANTED TO TALK
TO EVERYBODY, THAT'S ALL.

07:45.631 --> 07:47.675
{\an8}- YOU MADE IT SEEM LIKE
EVERYBODY HAD SOMETHING TO SAY.

07:47.758 --> 07:51.053
{\an8}- YEAH, I KNOW, I'M AN IDIOT.
I'M SORRY.

07:51.137 --> 07:52.555
{\an8}- IT'S OVER WITH.

07:52.638 --> 07:53.890
{\an8}- I'M SORRY.

07:57.768 --> 08:00.313
{\an8}- THIS GIRL'S BANGIN' MIKE
IN THE HOT TUB.

08:00.396 --> 08:00.479
{\an8}- HEY!

08:02.982 --> 08:05.234
{\an8}- ONCE HE WALKS THROUGH
THAT DOOR, I'M PUNCHIN' HIM.

08:05.318 --> 08:06.444
{\an8}- I'M LIKE, "DO IT."

08:06.527 --> 08:08.446
{\an8}- OHH!

08:18.789 --> 08:23.211
{\an8}- TONIGHT, PAULY D IS DOING
A SPECIAL GUEST APPEARANCE.

08:23.294 --> 08:25.880
{\an8}PAULY'S SPINNIN',
THE MUSIC'S AWESOME,

08:25.963 --> 08:27.256
{\an8}SO EVERYBODY'S

{\an8}VINNY'S HOOKIN' UP

08:30.968 --> 08:32.178
{\an8}I'M HOOKIN' UP WITH MY GIRL,
WE'RE HAVIN' FUN.

08:32.260 --> 08:34.138
{\an8}AWESOME NIGHT.

08:37.892 --> 08:40.561
{\an8}- THIS IS THE THIRD TIME
I HUNG OUT WITH TANYA,

08:40.645 --> 08:42.480
{\an8}AND IT WAS KIND OF
A BIGGER ISSUE

08:42.563 --> 08:43.773
{\an8}THE FIRST TIME I MET TANYA

08:43.856 --> 08:45.483
{\an8}BECAUSE DANNY WAS
CHILLIN' WITH HER THAT NIGHT,

08:45.566 --> 08:47.610
{\an8}AND EVERYBODY WAS
BOTHERING ME

08:47.693 --> 08:49.111
{\an8}FOR HANGIN' OUT WITH HER,

08:49.195 --> 08:50.696
{\an8}'CAUSE THEY FELT THAT I
TOOK HER FROM DANNY'S ARMS.

08:50.780 --> 08:52.740
{\an8}- YOU WERE SAYIN', LIKE,
HOW HOT I WAS.

08:57.536 --> 08:57.870
{\an8}LIKE, I REALLY DON'T CARE.

09:10.883 --> 09:11.592
{\an8}- I MEET THIS GUY
AT THE BAR.

09:11.676 --> 09:13.886
{\an8}FIRST OFF,
I SEE MUSCLES,

09:13.970 --> 09:15.638
{\an8}SO I'M, LIKE, OKAY, LIKE,
THIS GUY'S MY TYPE,

09:15.721 --> 09:17.598
{\an8}BUT HE'S, LIKE, IRISH,

09:17.682 --> 09:18.683
{\an8}AND HE TALKS LIKE A COWBOY.

09:18.766 --> 09:19.517
{\an8}I ALWAYS GO
FOR THE ITALIAN GUYS,

09:19.600 --> 09:20.851
{\an8}SO IT'S WEIRD FOR ME
TO LIKE HIM.

09:23.521 --> 09:26.482
{\an8}I JUST WANT TO BE
A VETERINARIAN,

09:26.565 --> 09:28.484
{\an8}HAVE MY OWN PRACTICE,
AND THAT'S WHAT I WANT.

09:29.902 --> 09:30.820
{\an8}- PAULA WAS MY DATE.

09:30.903 --> 09:32.280
{\an8}SHE WAS REALLY CUTE.

09:32.363 --> 09:35.574
{\an8}I HAD MET PAULA THE WEEK
OR SO BEFORE AT KARMA.

09:35.658 --> 09:36.492
{\an8}GIRL CAN SHAKE IT.

09:36.575 --> 09:39.287
{\an8}DROP IT
LIKE IT'S HOT, GIRL.

09:39.370 --> 09:41.289
{\an8}- [indistinct], BABY.

09:42.748 --> 09:43.082
{\an8}- ALL RIGHT, ONE KISS.

09:43.165 --> 09:45.251
{\an8}ALL RIGHT.

09:45.334 --> 09:46.294
{\an8}- WHERE WE GOIN'?

09:51.924 --> 09:53.467
{\an8}- ONCE WE LEFT THE BAR,

09:53.551 --> 09:54.302
{\an8}ON THE WALK HOME,

09:54.385 --> 09:56.470
{\an8}I BELIEVE
WE WERE PRETTY CUTE,

09:56.554 --> 09:59.640
{\an8}AND WE MIGHT HAVE BEEN
HOLDIN' HANDS POSSIBLY.

09:59.724 --> 10:00.850
{\an8}I WILL GIVE YOU
A TOWEL.

10:00.933 --> 10:03.311
{\an8}DO YOU NEED SHORTS, A SHIRT?
WHAT DO YOU NEED?

10:03.394 --> 10:06.355
{\an8}- I JUST NEED TO BE UP
BY 7:00 TOMORROW MORNING.

10:06.439 --> 10:08.691
{\an8}- AND I GRABBED
THE CHAMPAGNE

10:08.774 --> 10:09.317
{\an8}AND JUMPED IN THE JACUZZI.

10:09.400 --> 10:11.652
{\an8}- MY HAIR'S SO--
[laughs]

10:11.736 --> 10:12.820
{\an8}- I GOTTA WAKE YOU UP.

10:12.903 --> 10:14.030
{\an8}- [laughing]

10:18.743 --> 10:20.369
{\an8}- IF YOU LOOK AT ME,

10:20.453 --> 10:21.579
{\an8}YOU THINK I'M,
LIKE, A STUCK-UP BITCH,

10:21.662 --> 10:22.163
{\an8}BUT YET,

10:22.246 --> 10:24.081
{\an8}LIKE THAT'S MY ZONE.

10:24.165 --> 10:26.792
{\an8}LIKE, I [bleep],
LIKE, SAVE ANIMALS.

10:26.876 --> 10:28.169
{\an8}LIKE, THAT'S WHAT I DO.

10:28.252 --> 10:29.962
{\an8}LIKE, I THINK ABOUT SCHOOL,
AND I'M LIKE, "OH!"

10:30.046 --> 10:31.339
{\an8}LIKE, I COME
TO THE JERSEY SHORE

10:31.422 --> 10:32.882
{\an8}AND PARTY WHENEVER THE [bleep]
I WANT.

10:32.965 --> 10:36.344
{\an8}BUT THE FACT THAT I'M MISSING
MY LAST SEMESTER FOR THIS?

10:36.427 --> 10:38.054
{\an8}IT'S REALLY [bleep]
IRRITATING ME.

10:38.137 --> 10:41.766
{\an8}- THE BIGGEST RISK IN LIFE
IS NOT TAKING A RISK.

10:41.849 --> 10:42.892
{\an8}- HE'S A NICE GUY.

10:42.975 --> 10:44.602
{\an8}HE'S LIKE A GUY
THAT I DESERVE.

10:44.685 --> 10:46.103
{\an8}I DON'T DESERVE
A JERK-OFF.

10:46.187 --> 10:50.566
{\an8}I'VE BEEN WITH GOATS,
SHEEP, COWS, HORSES, THAT'S ALL.

10:50.649 --> 10:53.652
{\an8}I DELIVERED A FRIGGIN' CALF
FROM A COW.

10:53.736 --> 10:55.237
{\an8}- HEY, I PRAISE
YOU FOR THAT.

10:55.321 --> 10:56.989
{\an8}HOW MANY GUIDOS
CAN DO THAT?

10:57.073 --> 10:59.367
{\an8}- I'M NOT A GUIDO.
I'M A GUIDETTE.

11:11.962 --> 11:13.589
{\an8}- ARE YOU MAKIN' OUT
WITH OTHER GIRLS?

11:13.673 --> 11:14.590
{\an8}- LIKE YOU? NO.

11:14.673 --> 11:14.799
{\an8}NO, NO, NOT REALLY.

11:19.053 --> 11:20.471
{\an8}- LIKE, RIGHT NOW?

11:20.554 --> 11:22.014
{\an8}- NO, LIKE, I'VE NEVER
LAID ON A HAMMOCK WITH A GIRL,

11:22.098 --> 11:23.682
{\an8}LIKE, BROUGHT
A GIRL BACK TO THE--

11:23.766 --> 11:25.851
{\an8}I DON'T THINK I'VE EVER
HAD A GUEST BACK TO THE HOUSE.

11:25.935 --> 11:27.770
{\an8}'CAUSE I'M NOT,
LIKE, A MAN-WHORE,

11:27.853 --> 11:31.732
{\an8}LIKE, BRINGIN' HOME
GIRLS LIKE THAT.

11:31.816 --> 11:33.984
{\an8}- YEAH, I REALLY DON'T NEED
ANOTHER MAN-WHORE IN MY LIFE.

11:36.487 --> 11:38.781
{\an8}- I LOOK OVER
AND THIS GIRL'S BANGIN' MIKE

11:38.864 --> 11:38.948
{\an8}IN THE HOT TUB.

11:44.286 --> 11:45.204
{\an8}- I DON'T KNOW IF THIS GIRL

11:45.287 --> 11:46.705
{\an8}IS USIN'
ANY [bleep] PROTECTION.

11:46.789 --> 11:48.165
{\an8}LIKE, IT'S BAD.

11:48.249 --> 11:51.210
{\an8}- OH, WHAT THE [bleep]?

11:51.293 --> 11:52.294
{\an8}HEY!

11:53.462 --> 11:55.673
{\an8}EW! WHAT ARE YOU DOIN'?

11:56.882 --> 11:57.800
{\an8}- YOU KNOW WHAT,

11:57.883 --> 12:00.428
{\an8}SNOOKI JUST COMES
OUT OF THE WOODWORK.

12:00.511 --> 12:02.346
{\an8}I'M LIKE, "DUDE, COME ON."

12:02.430 --> 12:02.972
{\an8}THIS IS TOTALLY
RUINING MY NIGHT RIGHT NOW.

12:04.348 --> 12:06.058
{\an8}[thud]

12:09.228 --> 12:12.648
{\an8}- [laughing]

12:12.731 --> 12:15.109
{\an8}OH, MY GOD!

12:15.192 --> 12:16.152
{\an8}- HEY, THAT'S COOL.

12:16.235 --> 12:18.279
{\an8}- DO YOU REALLY
WANT TO LAY DOWN RIGHT NOW?

12:18.362 --> 12:19.613
{\an8}- I'M FOLLOWING YOU
RIGHT NOW.

12:19.697 --> 12:20.739
{\an8}- YOU WANT TO SNUGGLE?

12:20.823 --> 12:21.198
{\an8}- [kiss]

12:21.282 --> 12:23.534
{\an8}- I LIKE YOU.

12:23.617 --> 12:24.952
{\an8}I GOT TO KNOW KEITH.
HE'S A NICE FRICKIN' GUY.

12:25.035 --> 12:27.329
{\an8}LIKE, HE WOULD DO ANYTHING
FOR A GIRL.

12:27.413 --> 12:28.998
{\an8}- YOU LIKE TO GET
YOUR WAY, DON'T YOU?

12:29.081 --> 12:30.374
{\an8}- MAYBE.

12:30.458 --> 12:32.334
{\an8}- MAYBE?

12:32.418 --> 12:33.919
{\an8}- ME AND KEITH
START MAKING OUT.

12:34.003 --> 12:35.045
{\an8}WE DIDN'T HAVE SEX.
I DON'T KNOW WHY.

12:35.129 --> 12:37.298
{\an8}[laughs]

12:37.381 --> 12:39.925
{\an8}BUT IF I HAD TO HAVE SEX
WITH ONE PERSON HERE,

12:40.009 --> 12:41.135
{\an8}IT WOULD PROBABLY BE HIM,

12:41.218 --> 12:42.470
{\an8}BECAUSE I KNOW
HE'S A NICE GUY.

12:42.553 --> 12:43.345
{\an8}HE'S GOTTA BE CLEAN.

12:43.429 --> 12:46.265
{\an8}- YOU ALWAYS GET YOUR WAY,
DON'T YOU?

12:46.348 --> 12:48.934
{\an8}UH-HUH.

12:49.018 --> 12:50.561
{\an8}- DO YOU NEED ANYTHING?

12:53.230 --> 12:55.024
{\an8}- PAULA
IS REALLY, REALLY CUTE,

12:55.107 --> 12:59.862
{\an8}AND JUST BECAUSE THERE WAS
A SITUATION IN THE JACUZZI,

12:59.945 --> 13:01.655
{\an8}THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS
DOWN AT THE SHORE.

13:01.739 --> 13:01.947
{\an8}WILD.

13:14.376 --> 13:20.049
{\an8}[pounding at door]

13:20.132 --> 13:22.134

{\an8}I WAS LIKE, IT'S EITHER
THE POLICE FOR ME...

13:24.220 --> 13:24.970

{\an8}THIS IS
EITHER SOME LAWYER...

13:27.223 --> 13:28.849
{\an8}[pounding at door]

13:28.933 --> 13:30.851
{\an8}OR SOMEBODY'S DAD,
SOMEBODY'S BROTHER.

13:30.935 --> 13:32.061
{\an8}I WAS LIKE, OH, MAN.

13:37.650 --> 13:39.818
{\an8}- HEY. IS PAULA HERE?

13:39.902 --> 13:41.070

13:46.408 --> 13:47.743
{\an8}- YOU HAVE NO GAME AT ALL.

13:47.826 --> 13:48.786
{\an8}- THAT'S NOT WHAT
YOUR SISTER THINKS.

13:48.869 --> 13:49.745
{\an8}- [laughing]

13:49.828 --> 13:50.955
{\an8}- CAN I HAVE A ROLL, PLEASE?

13:51.038 --> 13:53.707
{\an8}- DON'T WORRY.

13:53.791 --> 13:53.958
{\an8}- YOU'RE A [bleep], BRO.

14:02.341 --> 14:05.094
{\an8}[pounding at door]

14:05.177 --> 14:07.555
{\an8}- I SLOWLY GOT UP,
AND I WAS LIKE,

14:07.638 --> 14:10.015
{\an8}"SOMEBODY'S KNOCKIN'
ON OUR DOOR."

14:10.099 --> 14:12.309
{\an8}- JUST WAKIN' UP, I HEAR,
LIKE, A NOISE, LIKE A POUNDING,

14:12.393 --> 14:14.812
{\an8}AND I THOUGHT SOMEBODY
WAS MOVING THE FURNITURE

14:14.895 --> 14:15.938
{\an8}OR COUCH OR SOMETHING.

14:16.021 --> 14:16.772
{\an8}I REALIZED SOMEBODY'S
POUNDING ON THE DOOR.

14:16.855 --> 14:19.191
{\an8}- IS PAULA HERE?

14:19.275 --> 14:20.943
{\an8}- SHE'S ASKIN' FOR PAULA,

{\an8}- YO.

14:36.292 --> 14:36.792
{\an8}- YOU MISSED
YOUR FIRST DAY AT WORK.

14:36.875 --> 14:37.793
{\an8}- NO, I KNOW.

14:37.876 --> 14:40.629
{\an8}- SO YOU DECIDED

14:40.713 --> 14:41.922

14:48.721 --> 14:50.848
{\an8}- MY CAR'S OVER AT KARMA.

14:50.931 --> 14:52.308
{\an8}- YOU TOLD YOUR MOM YOU WERE
GONNA BE GONE FOR AN HOUR

14:52.391 --> 14:54.476
{\an8}AND YOU WEREN'T DRINKING,
PAULA.

14:54.560 --> 14:55.311
{\an8}- YEAH, I THOUGHT THAT,

14:55.394 --> 14:56.895
{\an8}THEN I WOKE UP,
LIKE, [bleep] IT.

14:56.979 --> 14:58.814
{\an8}- WELL, CAN WE GO GET
YOUR [bleep]?

14:58.897 --> 14:59.940
{\an8}I TOLD YOUR MOM
I WASN'T LEAVING WITHOUT YOU.

15:00.024 --> 15:01.275
{\an8}SO CAN WE DO THIS,
PLEASE?

15:01.358 --> 15:02.901
{\an8}- YEAH.

15:02.985 --> 15:04.737
{\an8}- WHERE YOU GOIN', BRO?

15:04.820 --> 15:05.529
{\an8}- SHOWER.

15:05.613 --> 15:06.530
{\an8}I WAS LIKE,
"OH, [bleep], MAN.

15:06.614 --> 15:08.616
{\an8}I DON'T WANT TO HEAR
THIS DRAMA RIGHT NOW,"

15:08.699 --> 15:10.367
{\an8}SO I IMMEDIATELY WENT UPSTAIRS
IN THE SHOWER.

15:10.451 --> 15:12.077
{\an8}- YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU HAVE?

15:12.161 --> 15:14.330
{\an8}- NO, I HAD MY CLOTHES.

15:14.413 --> 15:14.997
{\an8}- WHO WAS IN HERE
WITH YOU?

15:19.668 --> 15:21.003
{\an8}- YOU SURE
THEY'RE IN THIS ROOM?

15:21.086 --> 15:22.254
{\an8}YOU DON'T WANT
YOUR CLOTHES?

15:22.338 --> 15:25.966
{\an8}YOU'RE JUST GONNA LEAVE
YOUR CLOTHES IN THEIR HOUSE?

15:26.050 --> 15:27.217
{\an8}OKAY.

15:27.301 --> 15:29.053
{\an8}- I DON'T FEEL BAD.
IT'S NOT MY PROBLEM.

15:29.136 --> 15:30.179
{\an8}I DON'T EVEN GIVE A [bleep].

15:30.262 --> 15:32.556
{\an8}- I JUST WANTED TO KNOW
WHO THE [bleep]

15:32.640 --> 15:33.515
{\an8}WAS BANGIN'
ON MY DOOR LIKE THAT.

15:33.599 --> 15:35.643
{\an8}- THAT'S MIKE'S PROBLEM.
HE TOOK HER HOME.

15:35.726 --> 15:36.852
{\an8}- [laughing]

15:36.935 --> 15:38.145
{\an8}WOW!

15:38.228 --> 15:39.480
{\an8}[Pauly laughing]

15:39.563 --> 15:41.065
{\an8}- TOO FUNNY, BRO.

15:41.148 --> 15:44.443
{\an8}- CAN YOU WRITE DOWN
YOUR CELL PHONE NUMBER?

15:44.526 --> 15:45.653
{\an8}- YOU GOT A PENCIL AND PAPER?

15:45.736 --> 15:46.612
{\an8}- YOU'RE NOT GONNA FIND
ANOTHER GUY LIKE KEITH

15:46.695 --> 15:48.906
{\an8}AT THE JERSEY SHORE,

15:48.989 --> 15:51.116
{\an8}SO I'M NOT GONNA FALL
IN LOVE AT THE JERSEY SHORE

15:51.200 --> 15:52.201
{\an8}UNLESS IT'S WITH KEITH.

15:52.284 --> 15:54.787
{\an8}I DO WANT TO HAVE SEX
WITH HIM.

15:54.870 --> 15:57.414
{\an8}I'M SAVING MYSELF
FOR COWBOY.

16:02.586 --> 16:05.798
{\an8}- YO, RONNIE, TANYA
IS GETTING PAULY

16:05.881 --> 16:06.965
{\an8}TO SPIN THAT BAMBOO.

16:07.049 --> 16:07.966
{\an8}- THOSE ARE THE KIND OF GIRLS

16:08.050 --> 16:09.468
{\an8}I BRING HOME, BRO.
- OHH!

16:09.551 --> 16:10.928
{\an8}- IF YOU'RE GONNA WATCH ME
THE WHOLE TIME

16:11.011 --> 16:12.805
{\an8}WHILE I'M IN THE JACUZZI
WITH SOME GIRL.

16:12.888 --> 16:15.057
{\an8}DID YOU GO IN THE SHOWER
AFTERWARDS

16:15.140 --> 16:16.058
{\an8}AND PLAY WITH YOURSELF?

16:16.141 --> 16:17.101
{\an8}THERE WAS SOME CREEPERS,
BELIEVE IT OR NOT.

16:17.184 --> 16:19.561
{\an8}I HEARD VINNY
WAS ON THE HAMMOCK

16:19.645 --> 16:20.646
{\an8}OR SOMEWHERE
MOST OF THE TIME.

16:20.729 --> 16:23.107
{\an8}VINNY JUST WISHES
HE WAS ME.

16:23.190 --> 16:24.066
{\an8}IT'S JUST A LITTLE CREEPY

16:24.149 --> 16:26.151
{\an8}THAT YOU STAYED THERE
AND WATCHED ME.

16:26.235 --> 16:28.445
{\an8}- I WAS ON THE [bleep] HAMMOCK!

16:28.529 --> 16:29.446
{\an8}WHAT'D YOU WANT ME
TO GET UP AND LEAVE?

16:29.530 --> 16:30.739
{\an8}BRO, I COULDN'T
[bleep] GET UP!

16:30.823 --> 16:33.575
{\an8}SHE'S RIDIN' YOU LIKE
A [bleep] DONKEY RIDE, BRO!

16:33.659 --> 16:36.120
{\an8}- YOU ARE JUST SEXUALLY
FRUSTRATED, AND IT'S OKAY.

16:36.203 --> 16:37.246
{\an8}LET IT OUT
IN THE SHOWER.

16:37.329 --> 16:38.956
{\an8}- BRO, YOU'RE
[bleep] 27 YEARS OLD.

16:39.039 --> 16:40.999
{\an8}I WOULD NEVER WANT TO BE
LIKE YOU WHEN I'M 27.

16:41.083 --> 16:43.252
{\an8}- REALLY?
- YEAH.

16:43.335 --> 16:44.795
{\an8}- THEN YOU HAVE NO GAME AT ALL.

16:44.878 --> 16:46.088
{\an8}- REALLY? THAT'S
NOT WHAT YOUR SISTER THINKS.

16:46.171 --> 16:49.425
{\an8}- OH, STOP.
- YOU KNOW WHAT, MY SISTER--

16:49.508 --> 16:50.217
{\an8}I DID THE INTRODUCTION.

16:50.300 --> 16:52.469
{\an8}I PUT IN, LIKE,
THE GOOD WORD

16:52.553 --> 16:53.512
{\an8}TO SAY THAT YOU WERE
A GOOD KID.

16:53.595 --> 16:55.389
{\an8}I DIDN'T REALIZE THAT
YOU'RE SUCH A [bleep].

16:55.472 --> 16:59.184
{\an8}- [laughing]

16:59.268 --> 17:00.728
{\an8}- REALLY.

17:11.821 --> 17:12.948
{\an8}- WE'RE GONNA GET
THE PARTY STARTED AT KARMA.

17:13.031 --> 17:15.325
{\an8}MIKE'S SISTER,
MELISSA, IS HERE,

17:15.409 --> 17:17.118
{\an8}HANGIN' OUT WITH US
FOR THE SECOND TIME.

17:17.202 --> 17:20.497
{\an8}I THINK THAT SHE MIGHT
HAVE A CRUSH ON ME, SO...

17:24.417 --> 17:26.336
{\an8}MUSIC'S PUMPIN',
WE'RE DANCIN',

17:26.420 --> 17:27.671
{\an8}WE'RE DRINKIN',

17:27.755 --> 17:28.589
{\an8}AND IT'S GONNA BE
A WILD NIGHT.

17:37.514 --> 17:38.640
{\an8}- I WAS HAVING FUN,
LIKE, ON MY OWN,

17:38.724 --> 17:41.518
{\an8}BUT I DEFINITELY, LIKE,
WANTED TO, LIKE, FIND RONNIE,

17:41.602 --> 17:42.853
{\an8}AND, LIKE,
SEE WHAT HE WAS DOING.

17:45.898 --> 17:48.901
{\an8}BUT RONNIE'S NOWHERE
TO BE FOUND.

17:48.984 --> 17:50.360
{\an8}I COULDN'T FIND HIM,

17:50.444 --> 17:52.196
{\an8}AND THEN I'M, LIKE,
A LITTLE WORRIED ABOUT HIM.

17:52.279 --> 17:56.742
{\an8}- I KIND OF NOTICED THAT RONNIE
WAS TALKIN' TO A GIRL.

17:56.825 --> 17:57.785
{\an8}I DON'T THINK IT WOULD BE
A BAD THING

17:57.868 --> 18:00.287
{\an8}IF SAM SAW THAT,
BUT, UM, I GUESS WE'LL FIND OUT.

18:00.370 --> 18:01.538
{\an8}[laughs]

18:20.015 --> 18:22.851
{\an8}- I SEE RONNIE
TALKING UP SOME GIRL.

18:22.935 --> 18:25.521
{\an8}I WAS LIKE,
"WHAT'S GOING ON?"

18:25.604 --> 18:26.480
{\an8}LIKE, I WAS PISSED.

18:31.610 --> 18:32.319
{\an8}I DON'T LIKE TO BE PLAYED.

18:32.402 --> 18:34.363
{\an8}I DON'T LIKE TO BE,
LIKE...

18:34.446 --> 18:36.031
{\an8}LIKE, THINKING I'M A FOOL,
'CAUSE I'M NOT.

18:41.912 --> 18:43.622
{\an8}- THE WHOLE RONNIE
AND SAM SITUATION

18:43.705 --> 18:45.082
{\an8}MAY BE CRUMBLING
AS WE SPEAK.

18:45.165 --> 18:46.583
{\an8}IT'S ONLY A MATTER OF TIME
BEFORE SHE'S GONNA

18:46.667 --> 18:48.460
{\an8}PULL THE EJECT BUTTON.

18:54.174 --> 18:55.509
{\an8}WERE YOU?

19:17.155 --> 19:18.657
{\an8}- MIKE IS, UM...
HE'S A CREEPY [bleep].

19:18.740 --> 19:19.867
{\an8}I MEAN, AT THIS POINT,

19:19.950 --> 19:21.368
{\an8}YOU'RE LUCKY I DON'T CRACK YOU
IN YOUR FACE RIGHT NOW.

19:33.881 --> 19:35.591
{\an8}MIKE NEEDS TO GET OVER IT,

19:35.674 --> 19:36.925
{\an8}BECAUSE HE THINKS THAT
SAM IS STILL FAIR GAME,

19:37.009 --> 19:38.802
{\an8}AND THAT HE STILL HAS
A CHANCE,

19:38.886 --> 19:41.054
{\an8}AND IT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN.

19:57.863 --> 20:00.574
{\an8}- I MET THIS REAL, REAL,
REAL HOT ISRAELI GIRL, DANIELLE.

20:00.657 --> 20:03.160
{\an8}SHE SEEMS TO BE, LIKE,
A REALLY COOL CHICK,

20:03.243 --> 20:04.536
{\an8}SO, I MEAN, I DON'T KNOW.

20:04.620 --> 20:05.412
{\an8}I'M UP FOR ANYTHING
JUST TO SEE HOW IT GOES.

20:20.802 --> 20:23.805
{\an8}- I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE?

20:23.889 --> 20:24.890
{\an8}MELISSA DEFINITELY
LIKES ME.

20:24.973 --> 20:27.309
{\an8}AND THE FACT
THAT SHE'S MIKE'S SISTER

20:27.392 --> 20:28.477
{\an8}JUST MAKES IT
SO MUCH BETTER,

20:28.560 --> 20:30.395
{\an8}'CAUSE ON TOP OF IT,
ME AND MIKE HAVE

20:30.479 --> 20:31.980
{\an8}A LITTLE BIT OF TENSION
BETWEEN US,

20:32.064 --> 20:33.899
{\an8}SO THE FACT THAT I HAVE
HIS SISTER UNDER MY ARM?

20:33.982 --> 20:34.733
{\an8}[bleep] IT'S THE [bleep]
FUNNIEST THING.

20:34.816 --> 20:36.860
{\an8}[laughing]

20:45.994 --> 20:48.538
{\an8}THEN I NOTICE
TANYA WALKS IN,

20:48.622 --> 20:50.582
{\an8}AND THIS IS A LITTLE BIT
OF A BAD SITUATION.

20:56.964 --> 20:59.257
{\an8}I PRETTY MUCH LEFT
MIKE'S SISTER

20:59.341 --> 21:01.843
{\an8}TO HANG OUT WITH TANYA.

21:06.098 --> 21:07.391
{\an8}- WHY DID YOU LEAVE WITHOUT
WAITIN' FOR ME TODAY?

21:14.272 --> 21:15.440
{\an8}- YOU KNOW WHAT? I FEEL
A LITTLE UPSET WITH VINNY,

21:15.524 --> 21:16.942
{\an8}BECAUSE
MY BABY SISTER'S THERE,

21:17.025 --> 21:19.820
{\an8}AND SHE'S, LIKE, NUMBER ONE
IN MY LIFE NO MATTER WHAT,

21:19.903 --> 21:22.239
{\an8}AND I NEED TO SAY SOMETHIN'
TO VINNY.

21:27.244 --> 21:29.329
{\an8}- MIKE, YOU WATCHIN'?

21:31.707 --> 21:32.874
{\an8}- HE NEEDS TO GET HIS [bleep]
HANDED TO HIM.

21:32.958 --> 21:34.835
{\an8}- OHH!

21:50.642 --> 21:52.060
{\an8}- VINNY'S ON MY LIST.

21:52.144 --> 21:53.895
{\an8}I'M A LITTLE PISSED AT HIM
BECAUSE HE'S NOT, LIKE,

21:53.979 --> 21:55.313
{\an8}TAKING CARE OF MY SISTER.

21:55.397 --> 21:55.939
{\an8}ALL RIGHT.

21:58.900 --> 22:00.402
{\an8}- WAIT, WHAT?

22:14.374 --> 22:16.793
{\an8}- VINNY KNOWS THAT I HAVE
A SHORT FUSE.

22:16.877 --> 22:18.420
{\an8}THAT I'M GONNA FLIP OUT.

22:18.503 --> 22:20.255
{\an8}HE KNOWS THAT I'M
THE MAN OF THE HOUSE

22:20.338 --> 22:21.715
{\an8}AND THAT NOT TO PUSH IT
TOO FAR.

22:21.798 --> 22:24.217
{\an8}[laughter]

22:39.775 --> 22:42.027
{\an8}- GET OVER HERE.

22:42.110 --> 22:43.361
{\an8}MIKE'S SISTER WAS
DEFINITELY A "FOR SURE" THING,

22:43.445 --> 22:46.656
{\an8}SO I THINK THAT'S WHY
I CHOSE THAT ROUTE.

22:46.740 --> 22:48.700
{\an8}[indistinct].
GET OVER HERE.

22:48.784 --> 22:50.869
{\an8}WHERE'S YOUR CREEPY BROTHER?

22:50.952 --> 22:51.953
{\an8}- NOTHING.
I'M SITTING ON YOUR LAP.

22:52.037 --> 22:52.412
{\an8}WHAT AM I DOING?
NOTHING.

22:55.665 --> 22:57.459
{\an8}- STOP! YOU'RE TICKLING ME.

23:00.629 --> 23:02.005
{\an8}- OOH! MIKE, YOU WATCHING?

23:02.089 --> 23:04.966
{\an8}- WHAT THE [bleep]
IS GOING ON OUT THERE?

23:05.050 --> 23:05.509
{\an8}- CAN I HAVE ANOTHER KISS
ON THE CHEEK?

23:05.592 --> 23:06.426
{\an8}- MWAH!

23:06.510 --> 23:08.970
{\an8}- YOU SHOULD COME SEE
THE HOLY LAND.

23:09.054 --> 23:09.930
{\an8}IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

23:10.013 --> 23:10.847
{\an8}- I'LL GET BEAT UP.

23:10.931 --> 23:13.517
{\an8}- IT'S JERUSALEM, DUDE.

23:13.600 --> 23:14.935
{\an8}- I'M CATHOLIC, DUDE.

23:15.018 --> 23:18.647
{\an8}- I LOVE MY--
I LOVE BEING JEWISH,

23:18.730 --> 23:20.148
{\an8}SO I'M JUST NOT
GONNA ANSWER IT.

23:20.232 --> 23:20.982
{\an8}- I DON'T EVEN UNDERSTAND
THAT RELIGION, WHAT IT IS.

23:21.066 --> 23:23.068
{\an8}I JUST WANT TO
GET TO THE BUSINESS.

23:26.571 --> 23:28.657
{\an8}- PAULY D...

23:30.117 --> 23:33.161
{\an8}- [man singing in Hebrew]

23:33.245 --> 23:34.287
{\an8}- IT'S ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE
TO HOOK UP WITH THIS GIRL.

23:34.371 --> 23:37.207
{\an8}I LOVE A CHALLENGE,
SO IF I DO THAT,

23:37.290 --> 23:37.916
{\an8}THAT'LL BE MY ACCOMPLISHMENT
FOR THE SUMMER.

23:42.295 --> 23:45.215
{\an8}- EXPLAIN TO HER, BRO, PLEASE.
- IT'S COOL.

23:46.383 --> 23:47.551
{\an8}- NO.

23:47.634 --> 23:51.221
{\an8}COME ON, HONESTLY, MIKE,
TELL HER THE TRUTH, BRO.

23:51.304 --> 23:53.223
{\an8}- DID YOU TELL ME RONNIE
WAS TALKING TO A GIRL TONIGHT?

23:53.306 --> 23:54.432
{\an8}- I'M GONNA TELL YOU
THE TRUTH.

23:54.516 --> 23:56.309
{\an8}IT WAS LIKE [bleep],
LIKE, 50 YARDS AWAY.

23:56.393 --> 23:58.603
{\an8}IT COULD'VE BEEN
A GROUP OF PEOPLE.

23:58.687 --> 23:59.813
{\an8}- OH, MY GOD.

23:59.896 --> 24:00.647
{\an8}- MIKE PRETTY MUCH SAID
THAT HE SAW ME

24:00.730 --> 24:03.108
{\an8}FLIRTING WITH ANOTHER GIRL,

24:03.191 --> 24:03.692
{\an8}AND WHEN ME AND SAM
CONFRONTED HIM ABOUT IT,

24:03.775 --> 24:05.068
{\an8}HE FROZE UP.

24:05.152 --> 24:07.529
{\an8}AND HE WAS LIKE, "UHHH,
I MIGHT'VE SAW IT.

24:07.612 --> 24:09.573
{\an8}I DON'T KNOW--THERE WAS
A LOT OF PEOPLE THERE."

24:09.656 --> 24:12.242
{\an8}SO I THINK HE WAS JUST FULL OF
[bleep] TO BE HONEST WITH YOU.

24:12.325 --> 24:13.660
{\an8}- SHE WAS UPSET IN THE CLUB.

24:13.743 --> 24:14.828
{\an8}- THEN I GO, "WHERE'S RONNIE,
WHERE'S RONNIE?"

24:14.911 --> 24:17.497
{\an8}- SHE WAS UPSET.
SHE WAS VERY UPSET.

24:17.581 --> 24:18.290
{\an8}AND I ACTUALLY TRIED TO
CALM HER DOWN

24:18.373 --> 24:19.457
{\an8}AND SHE DIDN'T EVEN WANT TO--

24:19.541 --> 24:21.084
{\an8}SHE DIDN'T EVEN WANT TO
TALK TO ME.

24:21.168 --> 24:22.878
{\an8}- I MEAN,
AT THIS POINT, MIKE,

24:22.961 --> 24:23.712
{\an8}I'M JUST KIND OF
LIKE, "WHATEVER."

24:23.795 --> 24:25.547
{\an8}I'M NOT FRIENDS
WITH FAKE PEOPLE,

24:25.630 --> 24:27.382
{\an8}SO I MEAN, YOU KNOW,

24:27.465 --> 24:29.050
{\an8}HE KIND OF SUNK HIS OWN SHIP
WITH THAT ONE.

24:36.725 --> 24:38.393
{\an8}- BECAUSE WE WERE FAR AWAY.

24:43.899 --> 24:45.442
{\an8}- THE SITUATION
IS GOING TO SLEEP.

24:45.525 --> 24:47.152
{\an8}- CAN YOU TELL HER
SHE'S PERFECTLY FINE

24:47.235 --> 24:49.154
{\an8}TO SLEEP OVER THERE?

24:49.237 --> 24:50.405
{\an8}- SLEEP OVER WHERE?
- IN SAM'S BED.

24:50.488 --> 24:53.533
{\an8}- OH, SAM SAID IT'S ALL GOOD.
IT'S ALL GOOD IN THE HOOD.

25:01.750 --> 25:03.251
{\an8}[Pauly chuckles]

25:03.335 --> 25:05.212
{\an8}I DON'T WANT HER SLEEPING
DOWNSTAIRS WITH VINNY.

25:05.295 --> 25:07.339
{\an8}I MEAN, COME ON NOW.
NO, THAT'S NOT HAPPENING.

25:22.354 --> 25:24.481
{\an8}- WHERE THE [bleep]
IS VINNY AT RIGHT NOW?

25:24.564 --> 25:25.273
{\an8}BETTER NOT BE
WITH MY SISTER.

25:25.357 --> 25:26.233
{\an8}- JUST SHUT THE [bleep] UP

25:26.316 --> 25:27.609
{\an8}'CAUSE NO ONE LIKES YOU

DRASTIC TO HERSELF.

{\an8}- NO, HE TOTALLY, LIKE, RUINED
THIS WHOLE THING.

33:03.189 --> 33:05.191

IN HIGH SCHOOL.

{\an8}I JUST GOT OVER IT,
LIKE, A YEAR AGO.

33:06.984 --> 33:09.696
{\an8}I HAD TO GO TO [bleep] THERAPY
FOR IT,

33:09.779 --> 33:11.698
{\an8}AND NOW IT'S BROUGHT UP AGAIN.

33:11.781 --> 33:12.865
{\an8}- SNOOKI DOESN'T EVEN WANT
TO EAT.

33:12.949 --> 33:15.118
{\an8}NOW SHE FEELS
LIKE HER WEIGHT'S A PROBLEM.
