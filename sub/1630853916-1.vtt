WEBVTT

00:29.166 --> 00:30.583
-Hey.
-Hey.

00:32.041 --> 00:34.916
I missed you this morning.
You were up and gone before00.

00:35.000 --> 00:37.500
Did the mega loop
twice today. Yeah.

00:37.583 --> 00:38.541
-Mmm.
-Mmm.

00:39.416 --> 00:42.500
-Once this morning, again just now.
-Ten miles? You're driven.

00:43.083 --> 00:44.333
You know who you married.

00:45.833 --> 00:46.666
Yeah.

00:52.416 --> 00:54.541
Leni, it's your sister calling.

00:55.500 --> 00:56.791
Again.

00:56.875 --> 00:59.625
I'm sure
I'm just being neurotic,

00:59.708 --> 01:02.166
but can you please give me a call today?

01:02.708 --> 01:06.916
Uh, in between mucking stalls or shoeing
horses, whatever it is that you do.

01:07.458 --> 01:10.291
But today. Call me. Okay, please?

01:10.958 --> 01:13.750
I am on my way
to that marketing meeting, you know,

01:13.833 --> 01:16.208
where they all smile
like they were taught how.

01:16.291 --> 01:18.291
They'll need me
to choose one of these covers

01:18.375 --> 01:20.166
and I have no idea, per usual.

01:20.250 --> 01:21.875
So, call me.

01:44.750 --> 01:46.250
-Good morning.
-Morning.

01:46.333 --> 01:48.250
-Everyone's gathered.
-Great. Thanks.

01:48.333 --> 01:49.375
-Coffee.
-You.

01:49.458 --> 01:51.666
Clearly not caffeinated enough.

01:53.333 --> 01:54.166
Mmm.

01:54.750 --> 01:55.708
Thank you.

01:55.791 --> 01:56.708
Morning!

01:57.500 --> 01:59.166
Hello, everyone.

01:59.708 --> 02:00.791
Good morning.

02:01.291 --> 02:03.375
Thank you for these cover comps.

02:03.458 --> 02:05.750
They are perfect.

02:06.666 --> 02:07.791
Really.

02:08.375 --> 02:09.291
Uh…

02:10.458 --> 02:11.500
But the book…

02:13.166 --> 02:14.000
is not perfect.

02:14.083 --> 02:18.750
And the woman at the center
is a fucking mess.

02:19.583 --> 02:21.000
Let's make a fucking mess.

02:23.291 --> 02:24.291
Shall we?

02:24.375 --> 02:26.583
A glorious collage. Go.

02:26.666 --> 02:27.750
You. You.

02:27.833 --> 02:31.208
Together, right? Rip them up.
Let's put them together.

02:32.708 --> 02:34.125
That's it. Give me that one.

02:34.666 --> 02:37.625
<i>Okay, Leni. I pulled it off</i>
<i>at the publisher's.</i>

02:37.708 --> 02:38.958
-Cheers.

02:39.041 --> 02:42.541
<i>I dealt with the movie people,</i>
<i>though we were supposed to talk first.</i>

02:43.958 --> 02:46.041
<i>But I'm starting to lose it a little.</i>

02:46.125 --> 02:48.041
<i>It's been 36 hours.</i>

02:49.041 --> 02:52.166
So where are you, all right?
I really need to…

02:54.333 --> 02:55.250
Shit.

02:55.333 --> 02:57.416
It's always unnerving
when there's more than one.

02:57.500 --> 02:59.541
Her voicemail is full. It's never full.

02:59.625 --> 03:01.250
Uh, is it possible that you filled it?

03:01.333 --> 03:04.166
Charlie, I can't shake this feeling
something's happened.

03:04.250 --> 03:06.291
-Darling.
-I've called Jack five times.

03:06.375 --> 03:09.250
-He hasn't returned my calls.
-Jack never returns your calls

03:09.333 --> 03:12.750
because he feels you bring
your LA drama to his quiet, Virginia life.

03:15.000 --> 03:15.833
What the hell?

03:16.625 --> 03:18.416
Did you leave
your office window open again?

03:18.500 --> 03:19.333
No.

03:20.500 --> 03:21.625
Maybe.

03:29.125 --> 03:30.375
-Charlie?
-Stay back.

03:39.666 --> 03:40.833
-What the…

03:45.041 --> 03:45.916
Jesus.

03:47.250 --> 03:48.958
It's like a raccoon house party.

03:50.250 --> 03:52.583
They just moved the fuck in.

03:54.125 --> 03:56.458
What are you doing
with all these maps of Lake Tahoe?

03:56.541 --> 03:57.375
What?

03:58.958 --> 04:02.541
Uh, for the birthday trip. Hiking trails.

04:02.625 --> 04:03.833
You hate hiking.

04:03.916 --> 04:05.708
I just thought for Jack and Leni.

04:05.791 --> 04:08.041
Well, these are all of the lake.

04:22.250 --> 04:23.166
Jack.

04:23.250 --> 04:26.583
Gina, hey. Something's happened.

04:28.375 --> 04:29.750
Leni's missing.

04:30.416 --> 04:31.791
What do you mean "missing"?

04:32.291 --> 04:34.750
<i>There was a break in</i>
<i>at the stables.</i>

04:34.833 --> 04:36.125
The police are here.

04:38.458 --> 04:40.583
They think she may have given chase or…

04:42.125 --> 04:43.416
she may have been taken.

04:50.125 --> 04:52.625
<i>Leni, I am losing my mind.</i>

04:53.666 --> 04:55.000
<i>Where are you?</i>

04:56.125 --> 04:57.166
<i>What happened?</i>

04:58.000 --> 05:00.375
<i>I knew something was wrong. I knew it.</i>

05:02.583 --> 05:04.916
<i>But no call from you?</i>
<i>Nothing in the diary.</i>

05:05.000 --> 05:07.250
<i>Jack's working</i>
<i>the colt today.</i>

05:07.333 --> 05:08.791
<i>So I'm coming home.</i>

05:11.833 --> 05:12.875
<i>Will I find you there?</i>

05:15.166 --> 05:16.833
<i>Will we ever be us again?</i>

05:19.583 --> 05:20.541
<i>I need you.</i>

05:24.166 --> 05:26.666
<i>I have to find you. We have to be okay.</i>

05:30.500 --> 05:31.375
<i>We have to.</i>

05:36.958 --> 05:40.000
<i>There's no world for me without you.</i>

07:12.958 --> 07:14.875
Samida! Liss!

07:14.958 --> 07:15.833
-Oh, Gina.
-Oh.

07:16.416 --> 07:17.791
What the hell is happening?

07:19.458 --> 07:22.416
Where's the search party?
Are Dad and Jack up in the hills?

07:22.500 --> 07:25.000
-Yes. They're still out.
-Where's Meg?

07:26.583 --> 07:28.125
-What?
-She's not here.

07:28.833 --> 07:30.458
What do you mean she's not here?

07:30.958 --> 07:32.416
But she's Leni's best friend.

07:34.208 --> 07:36.708
If she's not here,
who's looking after Mattie? Huh?

07:37.291 --> 07:39.416
-Uh…

07:44.375 --> 07:45.958
Hello? It's Gina.

07:48.833 --> 07:49.708
Wow.

07:51.666 --> 07:52.750
Trippy.

07:53.625 --> 07:55.041
Who the hell are you?

07:55.125 --> 07:56.333
Oh, Natasha.

07:56.416 --> 07:57.666
And why are you here?

07:58.208 --> 07:59.666
I'm Mattie's babysitter.

08:00.166 --> 08:01.916
Mattie doesn't have a babysitter.

08:02.000 --> 08:03.833
I work for Jack.

08:04.458 --> 08:05.750
Since when?

08:06.375 --> 08:08.166
A while. A few months.

08:10.958 --> 08:12.416
I'm gonna go see Mattie.

08:12.500 --> 08:16.375
Well, she's taking a nap.
You can come back later.

09:31.500 --> 09:32.583
Mommy?

09:32.666 --> 09:33.541
No.

09:35.333 --> 09:37.083
It's Auntie Gina, Mattie.

09:38.541 --> 09:39.875
I'm sorry, sweetheart.

09:41.250 --> 09:42.541
But I'm here.

09:43.458 --> 09:46.416
I'm here now, baby.
We're going to find your mom.

09:47.500 --> 09:48.916
Hey, they're back!

09:49.000 --> 09:50.083
Search party's back!

09:51.416 --> 09:52.500
Maybe they found her.

10:05.875 --> 10:08.750
Hey, sweetheart. Hey, how are you?

10:08.833 --> 10:10.125
You doing okay?

10:14.375 --> 10:16.375
Why don't you go inside with Natasha?

10:16.458 --> 10:18.583
I'll be in soon. We'll have some dinner.

10:18.666 --> 10:20.375
-Okay.
-Jack.

10:21.750 --> 10:23.125
What is going on?

10:23.708 --> 10:26.791
-Where the hell is Leni?
-Oh, God. I wish I knew, Gina.

10:27.625 --> 10:30.333
-I told you. I'll keep you in the loop.
-I couldn't stay away.

10:30.416 --> 10:33.541
-She's my everything. You know that.
-Okay, I get it.

10:33.625 --> 10:36.125
Just please, none of your usual.

10:38.458 --> 10:39.291
Jack.

10:43.083 --> 10:45.750
Look, she been talking to you?
Same as always?

10:46.541 --> 10:48.458
-Yeah.
-Has she said anything?

10:49.083 --> 10:51.083
What have y'all been talking about?

10:51.166 --> 10:55.583
She told me about breaking the new horse.
Last weekend. Going riding the new colt.

10:55.666 --> 10:57.375
Last week?

10:58.083 --> 10:59.083
What?

10:59.666 --> 11:03.083
-That new colt was a month ago.
-No, she just posted it.

11:03.875 --> 11:05.166
Daddy, are you coming?

11:06.791 --> 11:08.666
-What? Jack.
-Not right now.

11:08.750 --> 11:10.208
Gotta fix dinner.

11:13.541 --> 11:14.458
Gina!

11:15.083 --> 11:16.708
Gina, hey there.

11:17.333 --> 11:19.500
Louise Floss, it's sure been a while.

11:19.583 --> 11:20.875
Yeah, I remember. Deputy.

11:20.958 --> 11:23.333
Well, it's Sheriff Floss now.

11:23.416 --> 11:25.125
Believe it or not.

11:25.750 --> 11:27.250
It's been a few years, right?

11:27.333 --> 11:30.291
We used to run into each other
quite a bit back in the day.

11:30.375 --> 11:33.458
Oh, I'm sorry,
this here is Deputy Martinez.

11:33.541 --> 11:34.791
You can call me Paula.

11:34.875 --> 11:36.875
Why have you stopped searching?

11:36.958 --> 11:39.500
Well, we're starting
to lose the light, aren't we?

11:39.583 --> 11:41.375
Especially up on the trail.

11:41.458 --> 11:43.833
Have electric lights
not come to Mount Echo?

11:43.916 --> 11:45.875
Helicopters? The discovery of fire?

11:45.958 --> 11:48.375
Yeah, we got all that. Sure. And more.

11:48.458 --> 11:52.166
But this terrain,
it's rough and the vegetation's thick.

11:52.875 --> 11:54.875
I would think that you'd remember that.

11:55.541 --> 11:59.625
Gina had an adventure or two of her own
as a young person, as I recall.

11:59.708 --> 12:01.291
What the hell happened to Leni?

12:01.375 --> 12:03.000
Now that's the puzzle, isn't it?

12:03.083 --> 12:06.166
We got the bolts cut on the stables,

12:06.250 --> 12:08.416
the gates open, the horses released,

12:09.208 --> 12:11.583
and the stables office has been ransacked.

12:11.666 --> 12:12.583
Jesus Christ.

12:12.666 --> 12:16.250
Jack wasn't able to identify
anything missing in the office.

12:16.333 --> 12:21.541
But there is evidence
of at least one intruder on the premises.

12:21.625 --> 12:24.166
-Footprints, size 13.
-What?

12:24.958 --> 12:26.500
Do you think someone has her?

12:26.583 --> 12:28.166
We try not to hypothesize.

12:28.250 --> 12:30.791
Right, the detective
shouldn't have a theory of the crime,

12:30.875 --> 12:32.833
especially if it might be a kidnapping.

12:32.916 --> 12:35.333
Well, it can't be ruled out.

12:36.416 --> 12:39.625
But her saddle and bridle are missing,
along with her horse.

12:39.708 --> 12:41.125
Does that mean she took Prince out?

12:41.208 --> 12:42.291
Seems that way.

12:42.375 --> 12:44.208
Best case scenario,

12:44.291 --> 12:47.333
the intruders released the horses
as a distraction

12:47.416 --> 12:51.750
and she might have tried to round them up
and gotten lost or hurt.

12:52.541 --> 12:55.666
Your best case scenario
she's lying in a ravine somewhere

12:55.750 --> 12:57.750
and you're standing here
munching on apples?

12:59.333 --> 13:01.166
Finished the apple now, haven't I?

13:02.541 --> 13:05.375
-We keep doing everything we can, hon.
-Right, yeah.

13:07.083 --> 13:08.541
Must be hard to be back here.

13:09.416 --> 13:11.250
All that history.

13:12.083 --> 13:13.416
How you left.

13:14.125 --> 13:16.791
No, what's hard is my sister is missing.

13:16.875 --> 13:19.708
And it's almost dark
and no one is looking for her.

13:21.625 --> 13:23.500
Small town police work at its finest.

13:31.208 --> 13:33.750
Thanks everybody. You all right?

13:33.833 --> 13:35.958
Yeah. They just look identical, though.

13:36.041 --> 13:38.625
You get used to it.
It's harder when it's a friend, though.

13:38.708 --> 13:41.625
I don't think Leni would
call me a friend. She's been really nice.

13:41.708 --> 13:43.208
Not clique-y like the rest.

13:43.291 --> 13:45.375
That Gina though, she seems tougher.

13:45.458 --> 13:47.208
Yeah. Well, she's the troubled one.

13:47.958 --> 13:51.125
-Troubled one?
-Well, that's the story.

13:51.208 --> 13:54.625
Of course, there's more than one story.

13:55.291 --> 13:56.250
Huh.

14:04.500 --> 14:08.750
Good deal of sadness
around that family. Always has been.

14:13.666 --> 14:14.500
Hmm.

14:26.166 --> 14:29.458
I don't remember seeing him
at the search party. Do you?

14:32.125 --> 14:35.958
Uh, no, but there were
a lot of people there I didn't see.

14:36.041 --> 14:37.833
-You want to go back?
-Nah.

14:38.500 --> 14:40.958
Let's just remember
that vehicle, shall we?

14:48.208 --> 14:51.833
Hey, Meg. It's, uh, Gina.

14:52.875 --> 14:54.125
Uh, long time.

14:55.208 --> 14:58.833
Look, I'm in town for the search.
I thought I might see you there today.

15:01.250 --> 15:04.041
You know, I know you two
are such good friends. It just…

15:04.916 --> 15:08.583
It feels like there's something wrong.

15:08.666 --> 15:11.166
I mean, clearly wrong.

15:13.833 --> 15:15.208
I'll give you a call later.

15:34.083 --> 15:35.000
Gina.

15:35.791 --> 15:36.625
Daddy.

15:41.791 --> 15:42.750
Been too long.

15:53.875 --> 15:57.208
But did you see anything out there
today that gave you hope?

15:58.083 --> 16:00.750
We covered
all the open ground. She didn't…

16:02.625 --> 16:06.583
<i>They</i> didn't. Whoever it was,
they must have moved off the main trail.

16:07.416 --> 16:08.750
I'm so worried about her.

16:08.833 --> 16:10.708
Then you join the search tomorrow?

16:11.625 --> 16:12.500
Of course.

16:13.291 --> 16:15.291
Then maybe you could take his place.

16:15.958 --> 16:19.541
I told him not to go out today,
but he ignored me like he always does.

16:19.625 --> 16:21.625
You think I'm not gonna search
for my own daughter?

16:21.708 --> 16:23.000
But the doctor said that…

16:23.541 --> 16:24.916
What did the doctor say?

16:28.333 --> 16:31.666
-You know it's too stressful at your age.
-My age?

16:31.750 --> 16:34.541
I can do twice
what most hands on this farm can do.

16:35.208 --> 16:37.791
And I'll keep doing
until they put me in the ground.

16:37.875 --> 16:39.416
What did the doctor say, Dad?

16:44.500 --> 16:47.333
-What is going on here?
-Nothing. Nothing is going on.

16:49.541 --> 16:50.625
Is Jack okay?

16:52.833 --> 16:54.416
He was very strange with me.

16:54.500 --> 16:57.166
-His wife is missing--
-He's been under some stress.

16:58.375 --> 17:00.958
-What kind of stress?
-None of your business, is it?

17:01.041 --> 17:04.250
Our sister is missing, Claudia.
Can we put aside our grievances?

17:04.333 --> 17:05.958
Put aside our grievances?

17:06.041 --> 17:08.166
I don't know, Gina. I suppose you can.

17:08.250 --> 17:10.916
I'm sure you understand
why it's a bit harder for me.

17:12.375 --> 17:13.208
At the moment,

17:14.833 --> 17:16.458
I think we all want the same thing.

17:16.541 --> 17:17.541
Agreed.

17:20.541 --> 17:25.458
I mean, I'm blessed
to have you both with me. So, please…

17:41.875 --> 17:43.750
I'm a little jet lagged, Dad.

17:54.250 --> 17:55.833
<i>Back in this house,</i>

17:56.458 --> 17:59.833
<i>where I'm Bad Gina</i>
<i>and everything I do is wrong.</i>

18:02.125 --> 18:03.166
<i>And missing you.</i>

18:06.625 --> 18:08.375
-I like this game!

18:12.291 --> 18:14.125
It's okay. I'm okay. Sorry.

18:15.125 --> 18:16.583
Hey, y'all ready?

18:16.666 --> 18:18.166
Ready for the surprise?

18:19.333 --> 18:21.666
You remember the story
of the night you were born?

18:21.750 --> 18:23.500
Leni the Lion first.

18:23.583 --> 18:25.166
Leni the Lion first.

18:27.000 --> 18:29.041
Followed by Gina the Dove.

18:31.208 --> 18:34.000
As the moon and the night stars sang.

18:36.500 --> 18:37.750
The beautiful moon?

18:38.750 --> 18:39.833
That's right.

18:43.000 --> 18:45.291
I want you girls to wear these, okay?

18:45.375 --> 18:47.250
And I will always be with you.

18:48.291 --> 18:49.791
You two girls, you have something.

18:51.416 --> 18:54.125
You have something
no one else in the world has.

18:54.208 --> 18:55.583
Just the two of you.

18:56.708 --> 18:58.416
And you'll never lose it.

18:59.708 --> 19:03.375
As long as you love each other
and you hold each other.

19:04.250 --> 19:05.583
Always and forever.

19:07.666 --> 19:09.291
Just the two of you, okay?

20:10.583 --> 20:12.500
-Who did this?
-What?

20:12.583 --> 20:13.708
Who tore my doll apart?

20:16.208 --> 20:17.291
Was it you?

20:17.375 --> 20:18.916
Why would I do that? And how?

20:20.375 --> 20:22.000
Who else goes into that room?

20:22.083 --> 20:24.833
Well, Jack goes in there,
you know, from time to time

20:24.916 --> 20:27.583
to get little things for Mattie and…
and Leni.

20:27.666 --> 20:28.875
I mean, it's her room.

20:29.458 --> 20:32.291
That new girl was playing
with Mattie in there last week.

20:32.375 --> 20:36.166
Natasha was in my room?
What else has she done around here?

20:36.250 --> 20:39.666
I thought Leni told you everything.
I thought you spoke every day.

20:39.750 --> 20:40.791
We do.

20:40.875 --> 20:43.500
Clearly she doesn't tell you everything.

20:45.208 --> 20:49.500
-I'm gonna go stay at the Riverside.
-No, no, no. Gina, we're family.

20:49.583 --> 20:52.041
No. Daddy, I think it's…

20:53.041 --> 20:54.375
It's better for everyone.

20:55.875 --> 20:57.166
<i>Something's wrong here.</i>

20:57.250 --> 21:00.625
Someone tore up the doll
like it was a message.

21:00.708 --> 21:02.541
Old dolls fall apart?

21:02.625 --> 21:03.833
Might've been the nanny.

21:04.791 --> 21:07.750
There's a nanny
with a belly piercing who Jack hired.

21:08.333 --> 21:10.375
-That's not great.
<i>-Right.</i>

21:11.041 --> 21:13.625
And then Leni moved Mattie's bedroom
down the hall.

21:13.708 --> 21:16.833
And Meg's not speaking to Leni
and it's her best friend.

21:17.416 --> 21:19.625
She didn't tell me anything
about any of it.

21:19.708 --> 21:22.250
-None of it.
<i>-She should have told you. You're angry.</i>

21:22.333 --> 21:24.291
But is anger maybe easier
than fear right now?

21:24.375 --> 21:26.291
Are you seeing things
through a lens of anxiety?

21:26.375 --> 21:29.041
No, I'm seeing things
through a lens of "shit is fucked up."

21:29.125 --> 21:30.291
I can hear your voice.

21:30.375 --> 21:32.541
Please do not be my therapist right now.

21:32.625 --> 21:36.875
This is your husband telling you
to get some sleep because I love you,

21:36.958 --> 21:38.375
<i>not as a prescription. Okay?</i>

21:41.500 --> 21:42.458
<i>-Gina?</i>
-Yeah.

21:43.750 --> 21:44.625
I love you too.

21:45.333 --> 21:46.583
<i>-All right.</i>

22:50.166 --> 22:51.000
Cold.

23:03.416 --> 23:07.083
Who do I turn to now? It's always you.

23:07.708 --> 23:08.541
Us.

23:10.375 --> 23:12.041
I can't stop thinking

23:13.625 --> 23:16.958
about you out there in the cold and dark.

23:18.958 --> 23:21.125
Are you in a ditch somewhere, bleeding?

23:23.291 --> 23:25.541
Jesus, Leni.
Come back safe.

23:29.208 --> 23:33.625
And maybe you'll hear this someday

23:33.708 --> 23:38.208
and we'll laugh
about how I went off the deep end.

23:40.125 --> 23:44.166
But I am going off the deep end.

23:45.875 --> 23:48.208
If you get this, if you can somehow,

23:49.666 --> 23:51.750
I'm in room 11 at the Riverside Inn.

24:00.333 --> 24:02.833
<i>I'm getting lost</i>
<i>in memory lately.</i>

24:03.375 --> 24:07.125
<i>Maybe it's the time of year,</i>
<i>the apple trees budding.</i>

24:07.833 --> 24:11.125
<i>You know, reminds me of better days.</i>

24:13.125 --> 24:17.291
<i>I cannot wait to give you</i>
<i>your birthday present,</i>

24:17.375 --> 24:20.000
<i>but for now back to work. 12-hour days.</i>

24:20.083 --> 24:22.375
<i>We got a lot to get ready for. Okay?</i>

24:22.458 --> 24:24.125
<i>I love you. Bye.</i>

24:28.291 --> 24:29.291
<i>…work. 12-hour days.</i>

24:29.375 --> 24:31.833
<i>We got a lot to get ready for. Okay?</i>

24:31.916 --> 24:33.500
<i>I love you. Bye.</i>

24:36.291 --> 24:38.041
<i>I love you. Bye.</i>

25:19.291 --> 25:22.416
Now we are headed
into treacherous terrain today.

25:22.500 --> 25:26.041
Jack and Victor know this area
better than anyone,

25:26.125 --> 25:29.000
so we are gonna follow their lead.

25:29.083 --> 25:30.333
We're gonna move quickly

25:30.416 --> 25:33.958
so that we can cover
as much area as possible…

25:34.041 --> 25:36.416
-…in as little time as possible.

25:36.500 --> 25:38.166
-Excuse me.

25:38.250 --> 25:39.791
Prince. Prince. Whoa, whoa.

25:46.083 --> 25:47.916
What are you thinking there, Jack?

25:51.166 --> 25:52.833
There's blood. Some cuts.

25:53.333 --> 25:54.625
Human blood?

25:54.708 --> 25:57.583
We got a horse, bloody. No rider.
We need to move.

25:57.666 --> 26:01.125
We have a potential victim
in need of urgent medical attention.

26:08.583 --> 26:10.125
Do you think it was her blood?

26:10.791 --> 26:11.708
I don't know.

26:12.583 --> 26:13.708
But what do you think?

26:14.333 --> 26:17.125
I think I don't want to think about it
until I know something.

26:18.083 --> 26:20.416
Was something wrong between you two?

26:22.416 --> 26:23.750
What would be wrong, Gina?

26:23.833 --> 26:26.625
The last message she posted to the diary,
it was sentimental.

26:26.708 --> 26:28.500
Like she knew something was wrong.

26:29.000 --> 26:31.791
What do you mean? What did she say to you?

26:31.875 --> 26:34.708
No, it wasn't the words
as much as the tone.

26:34.791 --> 26:37.541
But, why? What words would matter, Jack?

26:37.625 --> 26:39.791
-Hey! They found something!

26:39.875 --> 26:41.416
-Over here!
-Come on.

26:44.083 --> 26:46.166
-Excuse me, Jay.
-Excuse me.

26:47.000 --> 26:47.916
Excuse me.

26:51.500 --> 26:52.625
Holy shit.

26:55.125 --> 26:56.125
Oh, my God.

26:57.541 --> 26:58.583
What does it mean?

27:00.333 --> 27:01.166
I don't know.

27:01.750 --> 27:04.041
Jack, you know horses.

27:04.125 --> 27:06.666
Maybe you can come down here,
give us a consult.

27:06.750 --> 27:07.625
Yup.

27:20.500 --> 27:21.708
Shit.

27:21.791 --> 27:24.666
Damn shame. This one belong to you?

27:25.708 --> 27:27.875
She's not one of ours, but we board her.

27:27.958 --> 27:32.625
Hmm. Poor thing. Looks like
someone shot her in the head.

27:33.583 --> 27:34.500
Huh.

27:34.583 --> 27:36.750
-My thoughts exactly. "Huh."

27:40.666 --> 27:42.708
I guess she fell and then, you know…

27:43.875 --> 27:46.541
-Whoever found her just--
-Yeah, indeed, "whoever."

27:46.625 --> 27:49.750
You know what?
I checked to see if she was chipped,

27:49.833 --> 27:52.958
because a microchip might
lead us to the "whoever,"

27:53.041 --> 27:55.375
or at least point us to the owner.

27:55.458 --> 27:58.791
But it's the strangest thing.
It was cut out.

28:01.083 --> 28:02.250
And not recently, either.

28:02.333 --> 28:05.708
Now, look, I am just… I am just
not a horse person, you know that.

28:07.041 --> 28:08.750
But doesn't that seem odd to you?

28:09.750 --> 28:11.791
I mean we board all kinds at the farm.

28:11.875 --> 28:12.958
-Uh-huh.
-I…

28:13.041 --> 28:14.416
I can't check every single one.

28:14.500 --> 28:16.666
Yeah, but you must keep records,
I imagine.

28:16.750 --> 28:19.500
Receipt with the name
of the owner on it, at least?

28:20.291 --> 28:23.416
Yeah, back at the office.
I can have someone look for it.

28:23.500 --> 28:25.625
I would think that would be a good idea.

28:29.000 --> 28:31.083
Yeah. Yeah, let's do that. Right away.

28:31.916 --> 28:32.750
All right.

28:40.375 --> 28:41.875
Dad, what is going on?

28:44.291 --> 28:45.125
Not here.

28:51.791 --> 28:53.916
Paula, I need you to come up here

28:54.000 --> 28:56.125
and tape off a crime scene, please.

28:56.208 --> 28:57.458
<i>Ten-four.</i>

28:57.541 --> 28:58.916
Hey, Gina.

29:00.291 --> 29:02.333
We never got a chance
to catch up last night.

29:02.416 --> 29:03.958
How about we do that now?

29:04.625 --> 29:07.083
Yeah. Let's go for a walk.

29:10.541 --> 29:12.833
I don't pretend to know
everything about everybody,

29:12.916 --> 29:16.250
but I've lived in Mount Echo a long time.

29:17.125 --> 29:21.083
And Jack,
he's a good man from a good family.

29:21.166 --> 29:24.875
He's not likely to get involved
in criminal activity.

29:24.958 --> 29:26.916
But if he was, then…

29:27.583 --> 29:30.833
Well, your sister being who she is,
she would know about it.

29:30.916 --> 29:34.458
Being who she is, she wouldn't let him
get involved in the first place.

29:34.541 --> 29:35.833
Well, hell.

29:37.125 --> 29:41.791
If I had a sister, I sure hope
she'd say the same thing about me.

29:42.583 --> 29:46.458
All I know is that my sister is missing
and possibly dead.

29:48.041 --> 29:50.000
Wouldn't we have found a body by now?

29:50.500 --> 29:51.875
This terrain's tricky.

29:52.666 --> 29:55.750
Or somebody might have her.

29:57.250 --> 29:58.833
Or she's just run away.

29:59.500 --> 30:00.583
Run away from what?

30:01.541 --> 30:03.291
That'd be the question.

30:06.041 --> 30:09.958
You know, it occurs to me
that there are things,

30:10.625 --> 30:11.708
private things,

30:12.958 --> 30:16.416
that are only shared inside of a family.

30:18.208 --> 30:22.250
So, if any of those things
should come up while you're here--

30:22.333 --> 30:23.958
I should come to you.

30:26.541 --> 30:30.333
Because your sister's life
might depend on it.

30:39.000 --> 30:42.083
She's asking for paperwork.
I can't just date something like that.

30:44.875 --> 30:46.166
I'll call you back, all right?

30:50.875 --> 30:52.791
-You following me?
-No.

30:52.875 --> 30:53.916
What, Gina?

30:54.000 --> 30:54.875
Jack.

30:56.375 --> 30:57.375
It's me.

30:58.375 --> 30:59.416
Okay?

31:23.166 --> 31:25.416
It hurts for me too,
you know.

31:29.375 --> 31:31.500
I just want us to be here for each other.

31:32.208 --> 31:34.458
Always here for you guys,
always on your side,

31:34.541 --> 31:37.166
whatever is going on.

31:41.541 --> 31:42.875
It's hard to look at you.

31:49.166 --> 31:53.833
You asked me
what we had been talking about.

31:53.916 --> 31:55.833
-What exactly--
-Just anything.

31:55.916 --> 31:58.125
Where her head was at, maybe.

31:58.208 --> 32:00.666
-Didn't you know?
-Come on, Gina.

32:01.583 --> 32:04.666
Does anyone really know
with either of you?

32:05.875 --> 32:07.208
She said she was tired

32:07.291 --> 32:09.666
because you guys
have been working 12-hour days.

32:10.583 --> 32:11.458
She said that?

32:12.458 --> 32:13.625
Yes, what?

32:14.250 --> 32:17.750
She hadn't been working 12-hour days.
She's barely around.

32:19.041 --> 32:20.666
In and out, at all hours.

32:21.666 --> 32:22.500
Doing what?

32:23.833 --> 32:25.500
I was hoping you could tell me.

32:28.416 --> 32:30.750
-So you hired Natasha.
-I needed the help.

32:31.416 --> 32:32.375
In the office.

32:33.541 --> 32:34.458
With our daughter.

32:34.541 --> 32:36.208
-So you have been busy.
-I have.

32:36.791 --> 32:39.625
Yeah. I'm trying
to make ends meet around here.

32:39.708 --> 32:42.250
But business is booming.
You're boarding horses.

32:42.333 --> 32:46.000
Yeah. Yeah, business is fine, Gina.
Everything's fine.

32:50.166 --> 32:51.000
We done?

32:53.000 --> 32:55.375
Do you mind if I go lay down in the house?

32:55.958 --> 32:57.375
I'm just so jet lagged.

32:57.916 --> 32:59.583
-Go on then.
-Okay.

33:13.083 --> 33:15.958
<i>I've been thinking</i>
<i>of the day of the funeral.</i>

33:17.083 --> 33:18.541
<i>When we ran away together.</i>

33:19.875 --> 33:22.458
<i>Promised to take care</i>
<i>of each other always.</i>

33:23.875 --> 33:27.791
<i>Just me and you until the end.</i>

33:37.500 --> 33:38.916
Momma, I've come back--

33:39.000 --> 33:40.083
Hey, sweetheart.

33:42.583 --> 33:44.125
Hey, Auntie Gina.

33:44.208 --> 33:45.083
You, uh…

33:47.291 --> 33:49.416
got a new room since I was here last.

33:51.458 --> 33:53.333
More room for your new dollhouse?

33:54.750 --> 33:56.208
Your mom didn't tell me.

33:56.291 --> 33:57.583
She's been missing.

33:57.666 --> 34:00.500
I know, honey. But before that?

34:01.291 --> 34:02.833
She's been missing before.

34:04.125 --> 34:05.416
But not for this long.

34:06.000 --> 34:08.416
She goes away and misses dinner sometimes.

34:08.916 --> 34:11.166
Natasha has dinner with Daddy and me.

34:15.083 --> 34:16.500
What's going on there?

34:17.250 --> 34:18.625
The mom is dead.

34:18.708 --> 34:19.916
Really?

34:21.458 --> 34:25.875
I think she just had too much to drink
and now she's having a nap.

34:26.916 --> 34:28.125
That's called drunk.

34:29.250 --> 34:30.708
How do you know about that?

34:31.416 --> 34:34.541
The priest in town sleeps on a bench
behind the church sometimes,

34:34.625 --> 34:37.416
and when I asked Mommy about it,
that's what she said.

34:38.041 --> 34:40.166
That's one thing I love about your mom.

34:40.916 --> 34:42.666
Calls it like she sees it.

34:44.083 --> 34:45.833
But Mommy's
dead now, right?

34:45.916 --> 34:47.166
No, she's not, honey.

34:48.875 --> 34:49.875
How do you know?

34:50.708 --> 34:51.583
Because.

34:53.333 --> 34:54.666
Because we're connected.

34:56.958 --> 34:59.083
Connected in a way
that other people are not.

34:59.166 --> 35:01.375
We're special that way. Do you understand?

35:01.875 --> 35:03.000
Twins.

35:04.000 --> 35:05.958
I know when things happen to her.

35:07.791 --> 35:11.291
And she knows my heart
like no one else in the world.

35:13.750 --> 35:15.833
I wish I had a twin.

35:19.625 --> 35:21.083
Mom will be home soon.

35:27.125 --> 35:28.875
<i>What are all these secrets you're keeping?</i>

35:29.875 --> 35:31.458
<i>What have you gotten us into?</i>

36:20.083 --> 36:21.125
Hey, love.

36:21.208 --> 36:22.958
Hi. Any news?

36:23.041 --> 36:24.666
It's not good.

36:24.750 --> 36:27.583
<i>Her horse came back from the hills</i>
<i>covered in blood.</i>

36:27.666 --> 36:28.708
Jesus.

36:29.583 --> 36:31.208
Jesus, and she's been out there…

36:32.041 --> 36:33.541
Are they moving fast enough?

36:33.625 --> 36:35.666
Do they have enough people
in the search party?

36:35.750 --> 36:37.000
Yeah, no and no.

36:38.541 --> 36:42.208
-I don't know what else to do, Charlie.
-Okay. What else have you found out?

36:42.291 --> 36:43.125
Nothing.

36:43.958 --> 36:47.166
Jack's not talking.
My dad knows something he's not saying.

36:47.250 --> 36:48.666
What do the police think?

36:48.750 --> 36:50.416
They think she's into something.

36:52.541 --> 36:54.291
-All right, I'm on a plane.
<i>-No, Charlie.</i>

36:54.375 --> 36:57.500
There is clearly a situation unfolding.
I don't want you to be alone.

36:57.583 --> 36:59.833
No. I need another day.

37:01.208 --> 37:03.166
Or two. To sort it out, okay?

37:04.416 --> 37:06.125
I need to be able to handle this.

37:06.208 --> 37:07.708
Gina, we ask for help.

37:08.416 --> 37:09.458
I will.

37:10.208 --> 37:11.875
I promise. But no one's talking.

37:11.958 --> 37:13.875
They already think
I'm Bad Gina from Hollywood.

37:13.958 --> 37:15.208
You know how this town is.

37:15.291 --> 37:16.708
I don't, really.

37:19.500 --> 37:22.000
-Look, just keep me posted. Okay?
-I will.

37:23.875 --> 37:26.166
-I love you.
-Love you.

38:05.000 --> 38:06.541
She thought it was you, Gina!

38:06.625 --> 38:07.875
But it was you, Leni!

38:07.958 --> 38:10.125
Gina. Leni.

38:10.208 --> 38:12.375
Leni the Lion first.

38:12.458 --> 38:14.208
Followed by Gina the dove.

39:41.500 --> 39:42.333
Leni.

39:44.208 --> 39:45.041
Hey.

39:51.333 --> 39:52.416
It's Gina, Jack.

39:53.083 --> 39:55.916
It's… It's me. I'm sorry.

39:58.666 --> 39:59.541
Did you hear me?

40:01.541 --> 40:02.583
Yes.

40:16.833 --> 40:18.875
I'm sorry.

40:20.333 --> 40:21.541
You shouldn't be here.

41:08.291 --> 41:09.166
Hello?

41:13.583 --> 41:14.708
Leni?

41:21.375 --> 41:23.916
It's fine. It's going to be fine.

41:24.750 --> 41:25.750
Do you trust me?

41:40.208 --> 41:41.541
What the fuck?

41:44.291 --> 41:45.958
Here. Switch with me.

41:46.958 --> 41:48.125
Switch dresses.

41:51.416 --> 41:53.958
Gina, you have to switch with me.

41:54.041 --> 41:55.833
You have to switch with me now!

42:54.458 --> 42:56.666
Enjoy your year in Los Angeles, Gina.

42:57.375 --> 42:59.458
Have fun in Mount Echo, Leni.

43:00.083 --> 43:02.958
Until we switch again next year in Tahoe?

43:03.041 --> 43:03.916
It's a date.

43:18.875 --> 43:20.125
<i>"Choose"?</i>

43:20.666 --> 43:22.958
<i>Gina, how the hell can I choose?</i>

43:24.041 --> 43:26.833
<i>I don't understand.</i>
<i>Why are you doing this?</i>

44:03.250 --> 44:04.250
<i>I've made it home.</i>

44:05.250 --> 44:06.791
<i>Hypothermic and dehydrated.</i>

44:06.875 --> 44:08.958
<i>Broken nails. Bruises on my right temple.</i>

44:09.041 --> 44:11.416
<i>Oh, it's convincing.</i>

44:14.291 --> 44:16.708
<i>Even though</i>
<i>I haven't played this part in a year.</i>

44:35.125 --> 44:35.958
Mommy?

44:38.500 --> 44:40.000
Mommy!

44:44.083 --> 44:45.541
Mommy!

44:46.333 --> 44:48.166
Baby! Oh, God.

44:51.458 --> 44:53.625
I'm home, baby. I'm back.

44:53.708 --> 44:55.666
<i>So, okay, Gina.</i>

44:55.750 --> 44:57.208
<i>I'll go back to being Leni.</i>

44:57.833 --> 44:58.666
<i>To being me.</i>

44:58.750 --> 45:00.375
Everything's going to be okay.

45:01.083 --> 45:03.208
<i>So I can find out</i>
<i>what you've done here.</i>

45:03.916 --> 45:04.958
<i>To both of us.</i>
