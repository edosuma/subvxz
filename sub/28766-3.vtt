00:06.005 --> 00:08.546
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

00:08.630 --> 00:10.588
THE LAME PLAN

00:10.671 --> 00:12.338
THE CRAZY PLAN

00:12.421 --> 00:14.963
THE BOOTY PLAN

00:15.046 --> 00:16.921
THE HOOK-UP PLAN

00:27.171 --> 00:28.713
Come on, reply...

00:28.796 --> 00:29.796
Girls?

00:30.255 --> 00:31.421
Shall I text again?

00:32.088 --> 00:33.088
No!

00:35.588 --> 00:38.713
She's waiting for the man-whore to reply.
What do we do now?

00:38.796 --> 00:42.130
I don't know.
I'm no expert in couples, as you know.

00:44.380 --> 00:47.588
Maybe Jules would be OK
with sending her a free text.

00:48.380 --> 00:51.338
Nice but to the point:
"Sorry, it's not going to work out."

00:51.921 --> 00:53.255
Want her to top herself?

00:55.005 --> 00:57.921
I don't get it. My plan was pure genius.

00:58.005 --> 01:01.213
No, it was pure shit.
Sex is not the answer to everything.

01:01.296 --> 01:03.838
How would you know?
You're, like, 40-months pregnant.

01:03.921 --> 01:07.755
Quite the opposite, actually.
Antoine and I have non-stop sex.

01:08.171 --> 01:09.463
Can you wait for me?

01:10.755 --> 01:13.046
I think I'm having
an anxiety heart attack.

01:15.255 --> 01:18.505
The guy is totally ghosting me.
I'm pathetic.

01:19.088 --> 01:21.546
He should be the one pining for a reply.

01:21.630 --> 01:25.755
-It's not your fault!
-It is! I'm the problem, he must pity me.

01:25.838 --> 01:28.505
I'm not even mad at him,
at least he was polite.

01:31.296 --> 01:32.880
Come on, reply!

01:44.130 --> 01:45.463
-Hello.
-Hello.

01:45.546 --> 01:48.588
-Can I help you, sir?
-Leave it, I'll serve him.

01:48.671 --> 01:49.671
Sir? Bûche du Poitou.

01:54.505 --> 01:56.421
Sorry, we sold out this morning.

01:56.963 --> 01:59.088
From the same region...

01:59.588 --> 02:02.421
I have a delicious Chabichou.

02:02.505 --> 02:05.296
Just outside, in the van.

02:06.546 --> 02:09.213
I'll be right back! Follow me. Sorry.

02:17.796 --> 02:18.796
Come on!

02:31.005 --> 02:33.505
Other people's lives are so much better.

02:34.171 --> 02:35.838
Mine just sucks...

02:35.921 --> 02:37.921
-Hang on, are you on Instagram?
-Yeah.

02:38.005 --> 02:41.796
Great move. Best remedy for depression.
Why not visit Gisele's profile?

02:43.630 --> 02:44.630
The aquarium?!

02:47.296 --> 02:49.380
Max and his whore went to the aquarium?

02:49.463 --> 02:52.671
-Stop stalking them!
-But I'm the one who loves sharks!

02:53.046 --> 02:54.338
It's so sexy.

02:54.755 --> 02:57.005
I bet they couldn't wait to have sex.

02:57.088 --> 03:00.796
I bet they did it by the dolphin tank
and it was amazing...

03:00.880 --> 03:02.130
Whoa, stop!

03:02.213 --> 03:03.296
Stop.

03:03.380 --> 03:05.796
Remember showing us his cum face?
It was awful.

03:05.880 --> 03:06.880
Oh, yeah.

03:09.713 --> 03:10.880
All right, enough.

03:15.838 --> 03:17.296
-Three skims!
-Honestly...

03:17.755 --> 03:18.880
"Littttttlebird."

03:19.838 --> 03:23.921
"Passionately curious." So fake.
Loser's version of Brangelina.

03:24.005 --> 03:26.380
To me, it means, "I suck dicks."

03:26.963 --> 03:28.171
-Yeah, totally.
-Yeah.

03:32.838 --> 03:34.338
-Three skims, for real.
-Yes.

03:35.546 --> 03:37.463
-Oh, fuck.
-What?

03:38.505 --> 03:39.505
What's up? They're engaged.

03:43.755 --> 03:45.588
-Max and Gaïa.
-What?!

03:45.671 --> 03:46.505
No...

03:47.005 --> 03:50.671
She was supposed to be a one-night stand,
not his future wife.

03:50.755 --> 03:53.630
-Elsa, stop!
-Hey, babe...

03:54.338 --> 03:59.088
He'll cheat on her, too, poor girl.
Men don't change.

03:59.171 --> 04:02.838
Absolutely, and that ring?
Seriously, it's gross.

04:02.921 --> 04:04.921
I bet it's from Target...

04:05.880 --> 04:06.880
How do you...

04:10.421 --> 04:12.005
How long have you known?

04:13.630 --> 04:16.171
-Not long, like, a week.
-Yeah.

04:16.255 --> 04:18.255
-A month, max.
-Less, less. Yeah, like, totally less.

04:21.338 --> 04:22.421
Elsa, wait!

04:22.505 --> 04:23.630
Elsa, we're sorry.

04:25.046 --> 04:27.255
Am I that pathetic for you not to tell me?

04:27.338 --> 04:30.171
-It's not just us, everyone knew.
-What?

04:30.255 --> 04:32.255
Matt's a groomsman,
he could have told you.

04:32.338 --> 04:33.838
You know what? Go fu...

04:34.755 --> 04:35.880
Shit, Elsa!

04:36.338 --> 04:37.505
Are you OK?

04:37.921 --> 04:40.671
-Elsa?
-Leave me alone!

04:43.588 --> 04:44.588
Do you hate us?

04:45.880 --> 04:46.713
Yes.

04:46.796 --> 04:48.171
Come on, sweetie.

04:51.213 --> 04:52.838
I'm screwed, anyway.

04:53.505 --> 04:55.338
No point in toning my ass.

04:58.963 --> 04:59.963
Call the man-whore.

05:04.338 --> 05:07.921
-This is the work of a psychopath.
-All right!

05:13.380 --> 05:15.421
Fuck. Obviously, it's the most expensive.

05:16.588 --> 05:17.755
What a pain.

05:17.838 --> 05:21.588
Please. I had to take Gaïa and her nephew
to the aquarium this morning.

05:22.130 --> 05:25.046
No, no, no. He kept trying
to punch me in the balls.

05:25.130 --> 05:28.755
And ended up being sick on me.
Look, I had to buy a new shirt.

05:29.671 --> 05:32.338
Don't laugh, it cost me 26 euros.

05:33.255 --> 05:34.796
I bet he did it on purpose, too.

05:35.755 --> 05:38.880
-Kids are a pain.
-You're going to be a good godfather!

05:39.546 --> 05:43.088
When are we seeing their lawyers?
I don't care if it's the weekend!

05:44.755 --> 05:45.755
OK.

05:47.046 --> 05:48.338
Well, tell them that.

05:49.005 --> 05:51.088
OK, great. Yeah.

05:52.005 --> 05:55.463
Keep me posted.
OK, Philippe, thanks a lot.

05:55.546 --> 05:58.630
-What's up?
-Nothing, just a fuck-up at work.

06:00.755 --> 06:02.588
-Oh, fuck.
-What?

06:03.213 --> 06:04.630
Elsa knows about the wedding.

06:05.921 --> 06:08.588
Well, at least now she knows.

06:09.630 --> 06:11.421
-How did she take it?
-I don't know.

06:13.880 --> 06:14.880
Poor girl.

06:15.796 --> 06:17.171
Hey, it's cool.

06:17.255 --> 06:18.755
I think she's met someone.

06:22.213 --> 06:23.213
Oh, cool.

06:37.338 --> 06:38.463
Crazy, right?

06:39.338 --> 06:42.755
The guy texts me
just as I'm giving up on life.

06:45.255 --> 06:46.755
"What about tonight?"

06:47.463 --> 06:49.588
See, he was just thinking
about what to say.

06:53.380 --> 06:56.005
Sorry, girls, I'm such a pain.

06:56.463 --> 06:59.588
-Whatever, shall we go?
-Wanna climb up?

06:59.671 --> 07:02.505
-Is it serious with this new guy?
-No idea.

07:04.463 --> 07:08.046
She might stop stalking me
and sending me nudes at 5 a.m.

07:08.838 --> 07:11.921
-It will give Gaïa and me a break.
-That's cool, right?

07:12.713 --> 07:13.713
Totally.

07:14.755 --> 07:17.421
No, the stroller's on us.

07:18.296 --> 07:19.588
-Really?
-Yeah.

07:20.005 --> 07:22.213
-You don't have to, guys.
-Of course we do.

07:22.296 --> 07:24.630
Gift from the godparents.
It's a thing, right?

07:24.713 --> 07:25.963
-A grand?
-Yeah.

07:27.005 --> 07:28.630
Come on, pull out the Infinite.

07:33.546 --> 07:36.338
Shit! I forgot it at the hotel.
Can you lend me the money?

07:38.171 --> 07:39.421
-Yeah.
-Shit.

07:39.505 --> 07:40.588
Sorry.

07:40.671 --> 07:44.213
-Thanks so much, guys.
-You're welcome, man. Really.

07:45.046 --> 07:48.796
-How far is your hotel? We could...
-I'll pay you back, don't worry!

07:48.880 --> 07:49.880
I'm not worried. I'm not worried.

07:52.005 --> 07:56.046
Just seeing their expression,
it moves me, you know?

07:56.130 --> 07:59.421
All this cheese!
It must have cost you a fortune, darling!

07:59.505 --> 08:04.546
Not at all, it's a gift from a client.
A cheesemonger whose accounts I did.

08:04.963 --> 08:07.171
You must have done some really good work.

08:07.255 --> 08:09.713
I told Angèle you were self-employed.

08:10.296 --> 08:13.380
-She was really impressed.
-Thanks, Mom.

08:13.463 --> 08:15.963
-You're not working too much?
-I keep telling him.

08:16.296 --> 08:20.630
Evenings, weekends, he doesn't stop.
His work rhythm... He's a beast.

08:21.505 --> 08:25.796
Oh, darling. Your dad would be
so proud of you in this beautiful suit.

08:26.296 --> 08:29.046
Such beautiful fabric.
It can't have been cheap.

08:29.755 --> 08:31.046
I'm glad you like it.

08:31.963 --> 08:33.796
-Anita, some Chabichou?
-Right!

08:33.880 --> 08:36.630
No, I'll go for some bûche du Poitou.

08:36.713 --> 08:37.838
It's been a while.

08:38.296 --> 08:39.296
And you, sweetie?

08:41.213 --> 08:42.046
No.

08:43.921 --> 08:47.171
Guys, you're crazy!
Thanks so much for the stroller.

08:47.255 --> 08:48.921
That's what godparents are for.

08:49.338 --> 08:52.005
-And Matthieu is loaded!
-Stop it.

08:52.588 --> 08:55.880
It's true, though. What's a grand to you?
An hour's work?

08:56.630 --> 08:58.130
Nice gesture, we appreciate it.

08:58.213 --> 09:01.588
For some, earning money isn't
a source of Judeo-Christian shame.

09:01.963 --> 09:02.963
Hand me the list. That's...

09:06.380 --> 09:07.380
What's this thing?

09:07.796 --> 09:10.005
It says it right there. A breast pump.

09:10.421 --> 09:12.796
It's manual
so it doesn't damage your breasts.

09:13.755 --> 09:14.838
It wasn't on the list.

09:15.171 --> 09:17.213
It's for <i>after</i> you give birth.

09:17.296 --> 09:18.588
Who said I'd breastfeed?

09:18.671 --> 09:21.546
I'm not a cow! For fuck's sake.
Do I look like a cow?

09:22.380 --> 09:23.380
-No.
-No...

09:24.505 --> 09:25.338
So?

09:25.421 --> 09:27.630
-Milou, are you OK?
-No, I'm not OK!

09:28.130 --> 09:29.963
You want us to eat the placenta, too?

09:30.046 --> 09:33.296
We're not in LA. Let's all eat placenta!

09:33.380 --> 09:36.380
Welcome. Placenta dinner party.
Placenta for everyone!

09:36.463 --> 09:37.880
I think we're going to leave.

09:37.963 --> 09:41.046
How can you not follow an Excel list?

09:41.463 --> 09:43.463
-We're off now.
-Thanks, guys.

09:43.546 --> 09:45.171
-Bye!
-Thanks for the stroller!

09:45.921 --> 09:46.921
It's beautiful.

09:48.088 --> 09:49.255
It's OK, I'll handle it.

09:51.046 --> 09:54.921
How can you go from Barack Obama
to Donald Trump so quickly?

09:55.005 --> 09:56.005
Physically?

09:57.255 --> 09:59.671
I mean, personality-wise.

09:59.755 --> 10:03.255
She's living with a watermelon
in her belly, I'd be bad-tempered too.

10:03.921 --> 10:05.796
-Happy to see you.
-Stop it!

10:06.296 --> 10:07.838
But you love it, buddy.

10:08.796 --> 10:10.713
-Not in the lift.
-Happy to see you.

10:10.796 --> 10:12.838
-Stop!
-It's tight in here.

10:12.921 --> 10:16.171
<i>Tonight, at the station bar</i>
<i>Igor is down, feeling blue</i>

10:16.255 --> 10:18.713
<i>Always having a brew</i>

10:18.796 --> 10:21.546
<i>As his Katie, his pretty Katie</i>

10:21.630 --> 10:24.463
<i>She just chucked him out</i>
<i>His Katie chucked him out</i>

10:24.546 --> 10:25.796
<i>And he's drawn a blank</i>

10:25.880 --> 10:28.088
<i>This old grand duke with his schemes...</i>

10:28.671 --> 10:30.796
They just love me singing Boby Lapointe.

10:30.880 --> 10:31.880
I know.

10:32.921 --> 10:35.046
Hey, Mom, for the bills.

10:35.130 --> 10:36.838
-Thank you!
-I'll put it here.

10:36.921 --> 10:39.546
So sweet of you, darling, thank you.

10:41.255 --> 10:44.130
Here, don't forget the <i>pica pau,</i>
your dad's recipe.

10:44.213 --> 10:46.046
Yes, and we'll finish it.

10:46.130 --> 10:49.463
Well, if there are any leftovers,
just invite some friends over.

10:51.046 --> 10:53.421
-Or a girlfriend.
-Well played, Inspector.

10:53.505 --> 10:56.755
At this rate,
I'm not getting any grandkids.

10:56.838 --> 10:58.755
I'll give you loads of grandkids, Anita.

10:58.838 --> 11:00.838
-New girlfriend?
-Every day.

11:01.880 --> 11:04.630
-But I want him to get a girlfriend!
-Mom...

11:05.755 --> 11:07.130
-We're off.
-Bye, darlings.

11:07.213 --> 11:09.630
Thanks, Anita, for the thing.

11:09.963 --> 11:11.796
-See you soon, bye!
-See you soon!

11:12.963 --> 11:13.963
Bye, Mom.

11:16.713 --> 11:19.713
Liars!
There are no 5-mm screws in this box!

11:24.505 --> 11:29.088
The guy who invented this thing has to be
a Swedish kitten-killing psychopath!

11:29.713 --> 11:30.713
You talking to me?

11:32.130 --> 11:34.296
No. Not specifically.

11:35.963 --> 11:37.838
I didn't know we were talking again.

11:41.130 --> 11:42.755
Wood floor or carpet upstairs?

11:44.380 --> 11:47.671
You might have to tell Charlotte
you want her room back first.

11:48.171 --> 11:50.505
Why me? She's your sister.

11:50.588 --> 11:53.171
But she's your bestie
and it's your parents' flat.

11:53.921 --> 11:57.755
We have enough space as it is
and we'll be co-sleeping anyway.

11:58.130 --> 12:00.171
-Co-what?
-Co-sleeping.

12:01.005 --> 12:02.088
Sleeping with the baby.

12:02.921 --> 12:03.921
No way.

12:04.713 --> 12:06.963
Babies make little noises,
shit themselves.

12:07.046 --> 12:08.255
Separate bedrooms.

12:09.171 --> 12:10.171
OK.

12:10.671 --> 12:11.796
Where are you going?

12:11.880 --> 12:12.880
To work.

12:13.546 --> 12:15.421
Or is that too degrading for you?

12:16.588 --> 12:17.588
Yeah... OK...

12:27.546 --> 12:30.713
You can't be a Real Madrid supporter.
We're in France!

12:30.796 --> 12:34.130
-Liberté, égalité, PSG.
-But they're so much more technical!

12:34.213 --> 12:37.171
Red Stars are the most technical.
But that's another level!

12:38.088 --> 12:39.213
I can't wear this.

12:39.921 --> 12:41.505
I'll look like his mother.

12:41.963 --> 12:45.963
You'll be wearing contacts. And looking
like his mom could be a turn-on.

12:46.046 --> 12:48.796
Was there not a Greek perv
who wanted to screw his mom?

12:49.338 --> 12:52.963
Yes, Oedipus. But he only found out
after screwing her that she was his mom.

12:53.046 --> 12:57.088
He poked out his eyes. Moral of the story:
be careful of who you sleep with.

12:57.671 --> 12:59.005
That was ages ago.

12:59.338 --> 13:01.421
I checked, Jules isn't your mom.
Go for it.

13:03.713 --> 13:04.880
Try this one on?

13:06.463 --> 13:07.463
-This?
-Yeah. Can I help you?

13:16.421 --> 13:17.713
No, I don't think so.

13:42.588 --> 13:44.046
I can see you.

13:45.463 --> 13:49.046
Have you seen this? It might have
been worn by someone ugly. Or dead.

13:49.380 --> 13:50.921
Be grateful I'm even interested.

13:51.505 --> 13:52.921
<i>That's</i> a fair price.

13:54.838 --> 13:57.838
And have you seen
what that dress does to my BFF?

14:00.505 --> 14:03.630
Let's get out of here,
I'll let you hire my clothes.

14:03.713 --> 14:05.630
-This place is lame.
-Hire your clothes?

14:05.713 --> 14:07.505
Times are hard, honey.

14:07.588 --> 14:08.630
OK, bye!

14:09.046 --> 14:10.046
Hey!

14:11.921 --> 14:13.296
Sorry, I...

14:13.380 --> 14:16.046
I'll pay for the dress and her top.

14:16.630 --> 14:18.213
I'll just go get my things.

14:18.296 --> 14:19.380
I should hope so.

14:35.046 --> 14:36.713
CORPORATE LAWYERS

14:44.130 --> 14:45.130
Come on!

15:13.630 --> 15:14.796
Cheers to hormones!

15:21.421 --> 15:22.421
One... two...

15:25.463 --> 15:27.505
There's some left. Sorry!

15:28.171 --> 15:29.463
-I'm sorry.
-Stop.

15:30.088 --> 15:34.213
What's crazy about clownfish is that,
when they're born...

15:34.755 --> 15:36.130
they're all born male.

15:36.838 --> 15:39.338
You know, male...

15:39.421 --> 15:40.796
like...

15:41.921 --> 15:42.921
with a willy.

15:43.296 --> 15:47.130
And so, you basically have
this male-only family.

15:47.213 --> 15:52.671
What's really amazing
is that all these fish you can see,

15:52.755 --> 15:58.171
they're from different species
but all end up in the same microcosm...

15:59.630 --> 16:00.838
in order to...

16:04.380 --> 16:07.130
Did I freak you out
with my clownfish obsession?

16:07.546 --> 16:11.171
-You're not saying anything, are you OK?
-Yeah, fine.

16:16.171 --> 16:17.171
It's my dress. It's too much.

16:20.171 --> 16:21.921
Not at all, you look pretty.

16:22.796 --> 16:24.380
Everyone else is underdressed.

16:27.421 --> 16:30.713
Look, they're pretty comfortable
with their style.

16:31.713 --> 16:34.838
-True, they're pretty sexy.
<i>-You're</i> sexy.

16:35.463 --> 16:37.546
What I want is to see you lose the dress.

16:46.130 --> 16:48.171
Want to take a photo with the jellyfish?

16:48.963 --> 16:51.088
-Yeah.
-Let's do that.

16:51.796 --> 16:54.380
-OK...
-Jellyfish are amazing because...

16:55.588 --> 16:56.838
there's a whole system.

16:57.213 --> 16:59.796
Hang on, sorry. There we go.

16:59.880 --> 17:01.421
Watch out, I'm poisonous.

17:02.755 --> 17:04.130
-Stupid.
-My hand like that?

17:04.213 --> 17:06.380
-Yep, a bit closer?
-All right.

17:06.463 --> 17:07.880
-Smile!
-OK.

17:08.505 --> 17:10.880
-It looks great. Smile?
-You like it?

17:14.838 --> 17:16.171
It's great.

17:16.713 --> 17:17.880
-Cool.
-Yeah.

17:17.963 --> 17:24.380
It would be great if we could shock people
like jellyfish when someone pisses us off.

17:25.630 --> 17:27.588
-My parents met like that.
-Oh, yeah?

17:27.671 --> 17:30.630
Yeah, on a deserted beach.
In southern Portugal.

17:30.713 --> 17:34.088
-My mum got stung by a jellyfish and--
-Your dad peed on her?

17:35.213 --> 17:38.463
No. He removed the tentacles with a shell.

17:39.630 --> 17:42.463
-It's so... It's so romantic.
-Yeah...

17:42.546 --> 17:45.046
My dad met my mum through his psoriasis.

17:45.838 --> 17:47.963
-Oh, yeah?
-It's much less...

17:49.380 --> 17:51.630
-Well, at least, they met.
-Yeah...

17:51.713 --> 17:53.046
And so you're here.

17:55.088 --> 17:56.088
And so...

18:11.546 --> 18:14.046
Sorry, I just really want you.

18:15.005 --> 18:16.838
-OK.
-I really, really want you.

18:16.921 --> 18:18.171
Yeah, me too.

18:18.880 --> 18:20.505
-Come.
-OK.

19:36.921 --> 19:39.630
Dude, I've never seen you
drink this much. You OK?

19:39.713 --> 19:40.880
Yes, I'm OK!

19:40.963 --> 19:44.963
Why is everyone asking me that today?
I should have stayed in London.

19:45.796 --> 19:47.046
What got into me?

19:47.796 --> 19:50.713
You're supporting me for once
and you took a good decision.

19:50.796 --> 19:52.255
-A good decision?
-Yes.

19:52.671 --> 19:56.005
I paid him to fuck her and dump her.
It's awful.

19:56.880 --> 20:00.463
-We'll figure it out before it's too late.
-Can you drop the "we"?

20:03.171 --> 20:04.963
Fate sometimes plays tricks on us.

20:05.671 --> 20:08.421
I wish I had never met you.
At least not now.

20:08.838 --> 20:12.463
I've been transferred.
Far. Very far. Too far.

20:13.171 --> 20:16.463
I can't say no.
You can't say no to Mulhouse.

20:17.921 --> 20:18.880
What?

20:19.213 --> 20:20.463
Those are his lines.

20:23.796 --> 20:26.171
My lines. I'm basically Shakespeare.

20:26.255 --> 20:28.671
Yes, OK, calm down. Yeah!

20:29.088 --> 20:32.046
-See?
-Yeah! Yeah...

20:33.088 --> 20:34.296
Yeah... Yes!

20:36.505 --> 20:37.505
Yes! Come on! Yeah!

20:48.130 --> 20:51.255
-I like this proposition.
-It's not even a proposition.

20:51.338 --> 20:52.963
OK, fine, whatever.

20:53.046 --> 20:56.880
-He changed sides.
-Don't you think Matthieu is acting weird?

20:57.421 --> 21:01.088
-He left really early. He seems on edge.
-Nonsense!

21:02.338 --> 21:04.338
He just digs his hotel.

21:04.421 --> 21:05.921
-Yeah?
-Yes. -Good night!
-Good night.

21:09.046 --> 21:10.588
-See you tomorrow!
-See you.

21:19.130 --> 21:19.963
Stop!

21:20.046 --> 21:21.130
Where are they?

21:23.713 --> 21:25.380
What are you doing here?

21:25.463 --> 21:27.421
-Shush!
-Oh, yeah, shush!

21:27.505 --> 21:28.588
Shush, I said!

21:33.755 --> 21:35.255
Shush! I did shush!

21:37.380 --> 21:38.213
Quiet!

21:44.338 --> 21:47.088
I'll have to charge for the night.
What about your hotel?

21:48.713 --> 21:50.588
Don't you have a life in London?

21:50.671 --> 21:54.838
A business? Snobby English friends?
A girlfriend? Girlfriends?

21:55.838 --> 21:57.338
Can I sleep here or not?

21:58.630 --> 21:59.463
Yes.

22:00.255 --> 22:03.130
But just a few days.
Don't get too comfortable.

22:04.088 --> 22:04.921
OK.

22:05.005 --> 22:06.005
OK? Nice view.

22:21.380 --> 22:22.380
You OK?

22:26.088 --> 22:27.338
This isn't my place.

22:30.796 --> 22:31.796
I lied to you.

22:32.880 --> 22:35.338
I've been living here
since the breakup but...

22:36.546 --> 22:39.546
It was my childhood bedroom,
now it's my dad's waiting room.

22:42.046 --> 22:43.880
It was supposed to be temporary

22:43.963 --> 22:45.005
but I never left.

22:53.213 --> 22:56.755
And at work, I feel totally useless.

22:57.338 --> 23:01.255
I work at City Hall but in a basement
and my desk is smaller than this bed.

23:01.671 --> 23:03.546
And I snore.

23:03.630 --> 23:06.338
I snore a lot,
especially after drinking red wine,

23:06.421 --> 23:10.671
and I follow Titi the Turtle on Instagram
and Celine Dion makes me hysterical.

23:10.755 --> 23:15.130
And I'm allergic to prawns.
I get a massive rash... on my bum.

23:15.213 --> 23:19.213
Telling you all this
is so embarrassing but I don't want...

23:22.338 --> 23:23.755
anymore lies between us.

23:24.421 --> 23:25.421
I hate lies.

23:31.796 --> 23:33.088
When I was little... I used to stand here...

23:36.338 --> 23:40.755
and imagine leaving on a spaceship
through the streets of Paris.

23:46.505 --> 23:47.880
-Are you mad at me?
-No.

23:49.713 --> 23:50.713
Of course not. Everybody lies.

24:00.296 --> 24:02.171
I kept something from you, too.

24:02.921 --> 24:03.921
What?

24:08.005 --> 24:10.505
Fate sometimes plays tricks on us.

24:13.171 --> 24:14.171
Shit...

24:14.630 --> 24:15.880
Listen.

24:15.963 --> 24:18.338
-I have to leave.
-What?

24:18.755 --> 24:20.713
I've been offered a job in Mulhouse.

24:21.713 --> 24:22.838
Oh, right, like...

24:23.546 --> 24:25.588
like East? Far?

24:26.380 --> 24:27.380
Far.

24:27.880 --> 24:29.796
Thanks, Department of Education.

24:31.505 --> 24:33.171
It's just better if we end it now.

24:34.088 --> 24:35.213
For both of us.

24:37.880 --> 24:38.880
I'm sorry.

24:48.380 --> 24:49.796
Oh, right, I...

24:50.505 --> 24:51.505
I...

24:52.963 --> 24:54.171
I understand, we...

24:54.755 --> 24:56.880
we hardly know each other, I understand.

24:59.338 --> 25:00.463
It was great.

25:01.088 --> 25:02.088
Really.

25:03.838 --> 25:04.880
I wanted you to know.
