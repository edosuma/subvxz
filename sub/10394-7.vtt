00:53.187 --> 00:55.355
A whole new crayon

00:55.356 --> 00:56.423
That was it for me.

00:56.424 --> 00:59.326
From then on, there was no
putting the pieces back

No going home.

Coming into focus, the
man across the table.

02:31.319 --> 02:34.787
He looks familiar.

Right.

Andy Ricker.

02:48.603 --> 02:51.204
The white guy who cooks
awesome Thai food.

02:51.205 --> 02:52.639
Pretty spicy?

02:52.640 --> 02:56.976
Put that in there.

02:56.977 --> 03:00.613
Andy has made a name for
himself faithfully reproducing

03:00.614 --> 03:02.549
the cuisine of
northern Thailand.

The good stuff comes
from places like here.

03:11.425 --> 03:16.896
Rice country.

03:16.897 --> 03:23.636
Chiang Mai province.

03:23.637 --> 03:25.638
In this part of the world, you

03:25.639 --> 03:33.639
live and die by the harvest.

03:34.415 --> 03:36.449
Thai food is intensely regional.

03:36.450 --> 03:40.019
In northern Thailand in

03:40.020 --> 03:42.054
particular, has many
distinctive features.

03:42.055 --> 03:45.091
This is a world of fresh,

03:45.092 --> 03:50.963
delicious, spicy, meaty,
salty, sour, sweet, bitter.

03:50.964 --> 03:55.034
Often with a just-picked
herby dimension.

03:55.035 --> 03:57.937
And always the most vital thing,

03:57.938 --> 04:02.375
giver of life, sticky rice.

04:02.376 --> 04:04.010
Andy here is constantly back and

04:04.011 --> 04:06.446
forth from America to Thailand,

04:06.447 --> 04:09.316
for nearly 25 years now, looking

04:09.317 --> 04:12.819
for recipes, techniques, digging

04:12.820 --> 04:15.955
deeper and deeper into an
amazingly complex and widely

04:15.956 --> 04:23.195
misunderstood cuisine.

04:23.196 --> 04:25.565
And getting his ass chastised by

04:25.566 --> 04:26.300
a few aunties as he goes.

04:26.301 --> 04:31.871
Okay.

04:31.872 --> 04:35.141
On this trip, Andy's working on

04:35.142 --> 04:37.377
a new book, investigating the

04:37.378 --> 04:40.647
eating and drinking
culture of the region.

04:40.648 --> 04:42.214
Which might be why he thought of

04:42.215 --> 04:45.852
me and why we're drinking
shine for breakfast.

04:45.853 --> 04:50.923
Where there's food, there's
also going to be booze.

04:50.924 --> 04:52.058
And likely, a lot of it.

04:52.059 --> 04:58.064
That's good.

04:58.065 --> 05:01.534
We make chili paste with

05:01.535 --> 05:06.739
chilies, garlic, shallot,
shrimp paste and tomatoes.

05:06.740 --> 05:14.740
Then you mix it with pork.

05:15.048 --> 05:15.282
Okay.

05:15.283 --> 05:20.953
Oh, yeah.

05:20.954 --> 05:21.221
Awesome.

05:21.222 --> 05:25.091
Isn't it delicious?

05:25.092 --> 05:27.460
This rice is grown
here in the village.

05:27.461 --> 05:29.462
You just kind of make a little

05:29.463 --> 05:30.263
spoon-shaped ball with it.

05:30.264 --> 05:33.500
Now, what's the famous agreeing?

05:33.501 --> 05:35.267
Is it have you eaten yet
or have you had rice?

05:35.268 --> 05:36.302
It's both.

05:36.303 --> 05:37.904
Literally it means have
you eaten rice yet.

05:37.905 --> 05:40.473
What it literally means
is how's it going.

05:40.474 --> 05:42.074
It is assumed that if you
haven't eaten yet, things are

05:42.075 --> 05:43.910
not going well.

05:43.911 --> 05:45.778
If you have eaten, rice is such

05:45.779 --> 05:50.550
a fundamental component...
Eating is synonymous with

05:50.551 --> 05:51.151
eating rice.

05:51.152 --> 05:56.122
To eat a meal without rice
would be unthinkable.

05:56.123 --> 06:01.794
What makes their
whiskey special?

06:01.795 --> 06:03.563
Because of the flavoring
that they add to it.

06:03.564 --> 06:05.565
Conveniently, our hosts in

06:05.566 --> 06:06.266
addition to having provided us

06:06.267 --> 06:08.100
with a fine meal, just so happen

06:08.101 --> 06:10.302
to run a distillery out back.

06:10.303 --> 06:12.138
They use a spice mixture they

06:12.139 --> 06:13.906
add to the yeast balls, let it

06:13.907 --> 06:15.508
ferment for five days, then she

06:15.509 --> 06:19.178
smashes it with a wood mallet.

06:19.179 --> 06:24.350
Thai rice whiskey, bucket of

06:24.351 --> 06:26.352
hootch, whatever you want to

06:26.353 --> 06:28.287
call it, this tastes delightful

06:28.288 --> 06:30.022
and smoother, apparently,
the more you drink.

06:30.023 --> 06:35.294
There you go.

06:35.295 --> 06:40.500
Well... and then fried fish.

06:40.501 --> 06:48.501
I believe it's called Nile
tilapia or Nile carp.

06:49.209 --> 06:54.714
Salt the hell out of
it and deep fry it.

06:54.715 --> 06:56.849
Good stuff.

06:56.850 --> 07:04.850
Mm.

07:06.794 --> 07:09.028
Guy's trying to kill us.

07:09.029 --> 07:09.262
Yeah.

07:09.263 --> 07:12.966
Okay, okay.

07:14.134 --> 07:15.735
For your uncle, yes.

07:15.736 --> 07:17.203
69 years old.

07:17.204 --> 07:18.038
He looks good.

07:18.039 --> 07:20.206
He drinks half a bottle a day.

07:20.207 --> 07:21.708
It's pretty much the Keith

07:21.709 --> 07:23.175
Richards health and
preservation plan.

07:23.176 --> 07:23.544
All right.

07:23.545 --> 07:24.911
I want to get healthy, too.

07:24.912 --> 07:30.216
The whiskey, I have to
say, is taking hold.

07:30.217 --> 07:33.252
In some clinically
fascinating ways.

07:33.253 --> 07:39.526
Funny.

07:39.527 --> 07:41.027
I lost the plot.

07:41.028 --> 07:47.066
Oh, that's okay.

07:47.067 --> 07:55.067
It all comes back to me as
the world shifts and tilts.

07:59.346 --> 08:00.913
Although I had been looking out

08:00.914 --> 08:02.081
a lot of hotel windows these

08:02.082 --> 08:04.517
days struggling to figure out

08:04.518 --> 08:06.919

08:06.920 --> 08:08.955
back shots of rice whiskey with

ancient Latta people.

08:32.445 --> 08:33.712
Welcome to Chiang Mai province,

08:33.714 --> 08:36.381
tucked up near the borders of

Burma, China, Laos,
India not too far away.

08:39.587 --> 08:42.422
All of them have left
their Mark on the food.

08:46.594 --> 08:48.595
Here's the local hooch.

08:48.596 --> 08:50.963
If you're eating here,
chances are, you're also

08:50.964 --> 08:54.066
drinking.

08:54.067 --> 08:59.471
Compared to the stuff we
had this morning, this is

08:59.472 --> 09:01.173
substantially more
harsh, I would say.

09:01.174 --> 09:07.146
And less fragrant.

09:07.147 --> 09:12.184
The village of may yon.

09:12.185 --> 09:13.953
This place is called Hin tang.

09:13.954 --> 09:15.121
How did you find this place?

09:15.122 --> 09:16.488
We're in the middle of nowhere.

09:16.489 --> 09:18.124
It's a very popular place.

09:18.125 --> 09:19.491
A restaurant showcasing one

09:19.492 --> 09:21.027
of the distinguishing elements

09:21.028 --> 09:22.795
of northern Thai cuisine, the

09:22.796 --> 09:25.431
heavy use of animal protein.

09:25.432 --> 09:28.467
You see the local people,
they're lining up.

09:28.468 --> 09:32.038
Here in northern Thailand,
pig reigns supreme.

09:32.039 --> 09:35.174
Most of the stuff we're eating
here is made out of pig.

09:35.175 --> 09:35.843
What did you order?

09:35.844 --> 09:39.311
Grilled pig tail.

09:39.312 --> 09:41.047
That sounds superb.

09:41.048 --> 09:43.515
Yep.

09:43.516 --> 09:45.885
Then we ordered northern
Thai herbal pork sausage.

09:45.886 --> 09:48.655
Oh, yeah, I'm on that.

09:48.656 --> 09:48.922
Brain.

09:48.923 --> 09:53.793
Some pig's brain.

09:53.794 --> 09:54.027
Yeah.

09:54.028 --> 09:57.864
I'm not a big brain fan.

09:57.865 --> 10:00.566
A custardy sort of texture,

10:00.567 --> 10:03.402
coupled with this
sort of nutty taste.

10:03.403 --> 10:05.337
Frankly, I would sooner grab a

10:05.338 --> 10:12.178
big handful of nut
sack, so to speak.

10:12.179 --> 10:13.545
I-'mixed with a curry paste and

10:13.546 --> 10:15.882
some herbs and stuff, thrown

10:15.883 --> 10:18.217
into a banana leaf
and then grilled.

10:18.218 --> 10:19.086
It's like eating scrambled eggs.

10:19.087 --> 10:23.355
You'll love it.

10:23.356 --> 10:25.057
Then we ordered raw blood soup.

10:25.058 --> 10:25.558
Raw.

10:25.559 --> 10:26.559
What do you mean,
they don't cook it?

10:26.560 --> 10:28.394
They do not cook the blood.

10:28.395 --> 10:29.029
They put it into a hot soup.

10:29.030 --> 10:31.097
No.

10:31.098 --> 10:31.531
This is raw blood.

10:31.532 --> 10:37.704
Really.

10:37.705 --> 10:40.072
There's two kinds that
you can get here.

10:40.073 --> 10:46.445
One is the addition of young...

10:46.446 --> 10:49.081
It's basically the partially

10:49.082 --> 10:55.187
digested juice that's made
from when a cow eats grass.

10:55.188 --> 10:56.089
Oh, geez.

10:56.090 --> 10:59.358
Oh, no.

10:59.359 --> 11:01.961
I did not order that.

11:01.962 --> 11:02.730
We're not having that.

11:02.730 --> 11:03.296
Okay.

11:03.296 --> 11:04.097
We're not having that.

11:04.098 --> 11:05.597
We're not having that.

11:05.598 --> 11:06.966
I'm thinking we'll stick to

11:06.967 --> 11:08.367
the plain blood soup,
thank you very much.

11:08.368 --> 11:10.269
The way they make it is they

11:10.270 --> 11:12.104
take the raw blood and they

11:12.105 --> 11:14.406
scrunch it with lemon
grass for a long time.

11:14.407 --> 11:15.275
Right.

11:15.276 --> 11:17.476
Because that kind of kills

11:17.477 --> 11:19.378
the gamey flavor of the blood,

11:19.379 --> 11:21.613
helps with the coagulation
and adds flavor.

11:21.614 --> 11:29.614
Then they actually
make chopped laarb.

11:30.257 --> 11:30.991
That goes in.

11:30.992 --> 11:35.295
Bunch of deep-fried innards.

11:43.771 --> 11:47.073
Here it is.

11:47.074 --> 11:50.309
You're not kidding.

11:50.310 --> 11:52.812
That's like a horror movie.

11:52.813 --> 11:54.480
Like "CSI" soup.

11:54.481 --> 12:01.287
I'm eating out of an open wound.

12:01.288 --> 12:02.155
Actually, that's
completely delicious.

12:02.156 --> 12:05.157
Utterly delicious.

12:05.158 --> 12:10.830
That makes you look
like a vampire.

12:10.831 --> 12:11.664
It's quite spicy.

12:11.665 --> 12:12.965
You can taste the chili.

12:12.966 --> 12:15.634
It doesn't really
taste like blood.

12:15.635 --> 12:17.203
It just kind of tastes
sweet and rich.

12:17.204 --> 12:21.774
Let's see if we can change
your mind about brains.

12:21.775 --> 12:22.209
Delicious.

12:22.210 --> 12:24.310
I'm not lying.

12:24.311 --> 12:25.045
This is delicious.

12:25.046 --> 12:26.178
Anyone would
completely love this.

12:26.179 --> 12:28.347
You eat too much of
it, you'll go blind.

12:28.348 --> 12:32.051
That's what they think.

12:32.052 --> 12:34.453
It has to do with parasites
and all kinds of stuff.

12:34.454 --> 12:34.955
Huh?

12:34.956 --> 12:37.023
Can I tell you some stories.

12:37.024 --> 12:38.657
Whoa, back up there.

12:38.658 --> 12:38.926
Parasites?

12:38.927 --> 12:43.629
Two or three years ago, a
whole family in nan province,

12:43.630 --> 12:45.531
all seven of them died.

12:45.532 --> 12:47.666
You probably should have told

12:47.667 --> 12:51.503
me that during the
appetizer course, okay?

12:51.504 --> 12:54.040
Honestly, best food I ever
had in Thailand, ever.

12:54.041 --> 12:57.543
I'm super happy to hear that.

12:57.544 --> 12:58.811
I would eat it out of a

12:58.812 --> 13:00.479
jockstrap on a hot summer's day.

13:00.480 --> 13:03.482
This is CNN.

13:03.483 --> 13:04.717
Oh, god.

13:22.903 --> 13:27.173
In Chiang Mai you can
move in and out.

13:27.174 --> 13:31.743
From the quiet green of the

13:31.744 --> 13:33.445
countryside to just a few miles

13:33.446 --> 13:36.348
away, the madness and
chaos of Chiang Mai city.

13:36.349 --> 13:42.354
Second largest in Thailand.

13:42.355 --> 13:43.455
Spirituality, reflection, the

13:43.456 --> 13:48.194
serene beauty of the rice
paddy, village life.

13:48.195 --> 13:48.929
Maybe next episode.

13:48.930 --> 13:52.764
This time, it's all about

13:52.765 --> 13:53.433
consuming medically inadvisable

13:53.434 --> 13:55.968
amounts of food and drink.

13:55.969 --> 13:58.604
If Thailand is one of the best

13:58.605 --> 14:02.108
countries to eat in, in Chiang

14:02.109 --> 14:03.575
Mai it's a particularly good

14:03.576 --> 14:06.612
city to find yourself hungry.

14:06.613 --> 14:07.047
That's the frog.

14:07.048 --> 14:10.116
That's the frog.

14:10.117 --> 14:15.454
It's basically taking that frog,

14:15.455 --> 14:19.258
grill him first, hack it up, fry

14:19.259 --> 14:24.931
the living bollocks out
of it with garlic.

14:24.932 --> 14:25.965
Mm.

14:25.966 --> 14:28.267
There's almost an inverse
relationship, like the more

14:28.268 --> 14:30.802
hideous looking the dish,
the more delicious it is.

14:30.803 --> 14:32.138
As you probably noticed by

14:32.139 --> 14:36.275
now, the food here is not pad

14:36.276 --> 14:37.910
Thai or green curry chicken.

14:37.911 --> 14:39.912
There are complex layers of

14:39.913 --> 14:45.851
flavor, sophisticated balances,

14:45.852 --> 14:53.852
spicy, sour, a little
bitter, salty, herby.

14:56.163 --> 15:00.366
Color and texture are important.

15:00.367 --> 15:03.602
Crispy, soft, cold, hot.

15:03.603 --> 15:06.205
It's exactly this interplay
between elements that makes

15:06.206 --> 15:11.210
northern Thai food so
thrilling and so addictive.

15:11.211 --> 15:18.350
This place is called
la gouchung cha.

15:18.351 --> 15:19.618
What is that curry material?

15:19.619 --> 15:22.221
That's one of the many
stomachs of the cow.

15:22.222 --> 15:26.025
Might be the third stomach.

15:26.026 --> 15:26.859
Mine's bitter.

15:26.860 --> 15:30.062
Means it has a
little bit of bile.

15:30.063 --> 15:38.063
The gentleman over there,
uncle, he's the laarb master.

15:39.839 --> 15:40.807
He wins competitions.

15:40.808 --> 15:47.046
The woman that just took
the order, her family, the

15:47.047 --> 15:49.215
uncle's... when it gets really

15:49.216 --> 15:57.216
busy, the rest of the
family comes and helps.

15:59.759 --> 16:02.161
You famously said you
hate the word authentic.

16:02.162 --> 16:03.063
What does that word mean?

16:03.064 --> 16:04.730
Depends on the context.

16:04.731 --> 16:07.333
If you're in the United States
and you say traditional

16:07.334 --> 16:09.735
authentic Thai restaurant, to me

16:09.736 --> 16:11.837
that has come to mean a standard

16:11.838 --> 16:12.904
Thai restaurant in America.

16:12.905 --> 16:13.506
That menu.

16:13.507 --> 16:15.007
When you come here,
authentic is different.

16:15.008 --> 16:16.508
You're the daughter of the woman

16:16.509 --> 16:17.743
who made this, then to you this

16:17.744 --> 16:20.446
is the most authentic
version of that dish.

16:20.447 --> 16:23.749
If you are from nan province,

16:23.750 --> 16:26.218
you still make laarb but it
doesn't taste like this.

16:26.219 --> 16:30.622
Little bit different.

16:30.623 --> 16:38.623
This laarb is amazing.

16:40.700 --> 16:43.102
Friday night and Chiang
Mai comes alive.

16:43.103 --> 16:43.636
Thailand, we will come.

16:43.637 --> 16:46.772
We love you!

place to the other until we

16:53.980 --> 16:56.415
simply can't take it no more.

16:56.416 --> 16:58.150
Next stop, it ain't flavor town.

16:58.151 --> 16:59.318
It's some place
beyond that, man.

16:59.319 --> 17:03.622

I am not an alcoholic.

If I'm not working, I'm
not hanging out in bars.

17:26.346 --> 17:28.280
But if I was an alcoholic, and I

17:28.281 --> 17:31.016
did hang in bars, I
would hang here.

17:31.017 --> 17:33.419
Some karaoke, maybe?

17:33.420 --> 17:34.820
Even though the very mention

17:34.821 --> 17:42.821
of karaoke makes my blood
run cold with fear.

Things go just a little wrong, I

19:04.411 --> 19:10.349
go off the rails, this would

to Thailand first?

21:40.867 --> 21:43.201
I believe it was 1987.

21:43.202 --> 21:45.103
And I came as a backpacker.

21:45.104 --> 21:46.938
It was all about smoking dope on

21:46.939 --> 21:48.774
the beach, eating mushrooms,

21:48.775 --> 21:50.376
chasing girls and drinking beer.

21:50.377 --> 21:51.843
I had a three-month ticket and

22:06.893 --> 22:08.727
where they just said okay, my

22:08.728 --> 22:09.761
previous life is not going to be

22:09.762 --> 22:10.962
enough for me anymore, you know?

22:10.963 --> 22:12.931
There's a particular mushroom.

22:12.932 --> 22:13.965
They make soup out of it.

22:13.966 --> 22:16.435
It was unlike anything I
had ever had in my life.

22:16.436 --> 22:17.769
When I first came out to this

22:17.770 --> 22:21.740
part of the world, noodles.

22:21.741 --> 22:23.809
I knew right then.

22:23.810 --> 22:25.110
I'm not joking.

22:25.111 --> 22:27.579
It wasn't the girls,
it wasn't the beaches.

22:27.580 --> 22:30.549
The noodles, the greasy bottle

22:30.550 --> 22:34.119

where you realize I
can't share this.

been serving this.

Slowly stewed pork.

23:17.698 --> 23:20.566
She cooks it in a master sauce.

23:20.567 --> 23:22.568
It probably goes back
at least a generation.
