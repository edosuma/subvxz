01:41.782 --> 01:45.274
And now, the conclusion of
Judgment From Outer Space.

02:44.111 --> 02:47.808
One of the primitives is trying
to activate Andros' key control.

02:47.881 --> 02:49.212
Let her, Gorel.

02:49.583 --> 02:51.414
If the correct signal isn't sent...

02:51.485 --> 02:54.921
the satellite would automatically
destroy their planet.

02:55.422 --> 02:57.083
We won't have to bother.

03:35.762 --> 03:39.220
General, I just received a report
of an unidentified submarine.

03:39.299 --> 03:40.926
A PBY spotted it this morning.

03:41.001 --> 03:43.492
I checked AtCom
and none of our subs are in that area.

03:43.570 --> 03:46.164
It could be the way of getting Andros
out of the country.

03:46.239 --> 03:48.571
Red alert the anti-sub patrol
immediately...

03:48.642 --> 03:50.974
and get every available PBY in the air.

03:51.044 --> 03:54.013
I want that craft identified and seized.

03:54.114 --> 03:55.979
We've got to get Andros back.

04:26.513 --> 04:29.141
The Nazi humans
now have Andros prisoner...

04:29.216 --> 04:31.377
and are taking him to their homeland.

04:31.651 --> 04:34.916
How much more must we see
before the judgment is made?

05:46.793 --> 05:49.318
Please, if you hear me...

05:50.564 --> 05:52.054
wherever you are...

05:52.699 --> 05:54.826
Andros has been captured by the Nazis...

05:54.901 --> 05:58.234
and he needs whatever strength
and powers that you can give him.

05:58.905 --> 06:01.066
He told me about his mission
here on Earth.

06:01.141 --> 06:03.974
There are good people here,
people worth saving.

06:04.044 --> 06:06.376
People who right now
are risking their lives...

06:06.880 --> 06:09.781
to try to save a stranger like Andros.

06:11.351 --> 06:13.182
If you can hear me...

06:14.421 --> 06:17.288
please help.

06:20.727 --> 06:24.322
I still say all humans are alike
and not worth saving.

06:24.397 --> 06:27.889
It is Andros' mission to decide that.

06:28.068 --> 06:31.037
We cannot leave him without hope
as you would wish it.

06:31.104 --> 06:33.004
Then leave him the spacecraft.

06:33.239 --> 06:34.866
If he can gain his freedom...

06:34.941 --> 06:37.501
and if his humans are civilized enough
to help him...

06:37.577 --> 06:39.875
why, then, he's proved his point.

06:40.146 --> 06:41.670
Otherwise...

06:41.848 --> 06:45.249
Let him die? Alone, among savages?

06:45.318 --> 06:47.286
Andros chose the test.

06:48.355 --> 06:49.982
I call a vote.

07:16.082 --> 07:18.380
As the Council has decided.

07:27.761 --> 07:31.424
We've been searching all sections
of the north and south Atlantic...

07:31.498 --> 07:32.988
for two weeks now.

07:33.066 --> 07:36.968
We have to assume
that they've gotten away with Andros.

07:37.037 --> 07:39.631
I think we should proceed immediately
on the information...

07:39.706 --> 07:41.697
Prime Minister Churchill gave you.

07:41.975 --> 07:45.467
Yes, Mr. President.
I'll implement the plan immediately.

07:48.014 --> 07:50.983
Churchill has told the President
that British Intelligence...

07:51.051 --> 07:54.680
knows of a heavily secured
enemy intelligence interrogation center.

07:54.754 --> 07:57.222
We feel sure that's
where they'll take Andros.

07:57.290 --> 08:00.657
It's heavily guarded
and extremely difficult to penetrate.

08:00.727 --> 08:02.354
But not impossible.

08:02.662 --> 08:04.152
I'd like to volunteer to try.

08:04.230 --> 08:06.596
- How soon can you leave for London?
- Tonight.

08:06.666 --> 08:08.827
Diana can look after the office
while I'm gone.

08:08.902 --> 08:10.096
Of course, sir.

08:10.170 --> 08:13.003
I'll secure full cooperation
from the British.

08:13.573 --> 08:16.337
This interrogation center, what's it called?

08:16.409 --> 08:17.967
Schloss Markheim.

08:32.625 --> 08:36.686
- I trust you will be comfortable.
- No matter, Mr. Bjornsen.

08:36.763 --> 08:39.424
If you like you may wash, change clothes.

08:39.499 --> 08:41.659
Dinner will be black tie in one hour.

08:41.735 --> 08:43.327
And I'm invited?

08:43.403 --> 08:45.496
You are the honored guest, Doctor.

08:53.413 --> 08:55.040
Guest, of course.

09:04.224 --> 09:06.249
Even given me a black tie.

09:21.741 --> 09:23.902
- General Clewes.
- Yes.

09:23.977 --> 09:25.774
You're admirably prompt, Major Trevor.

09:25.845 --> 09:27.142
I had a good flight, sir.

09:27.213 --> 09:30.842
Yes, and God willing, an equally good one
over the Schwarzwald.

09:33.319 --> 09:37.187
I'd like to have you meet Evan Mallory.

09:37.924 --> 09:39.789
- Steve Trevor.
- My pleasure.

09:39.859 --> 09:40.985
Thank you.

09:41.060 --> 09:44.928
Mallory is going to guide you
to the Nazi Interrogation Center...

09:45.031 --> 09:47.397
Located at Schloss Markheim.

09:47.467 --> 09:50.300
You see, I have a very solid
false identity...

09:50.370 --> 09:53.032
as a Nazi officer just returned
from the Russian front.

09:53.106 --> 09:56.439
You'll have papers identifying you
as a technical aide on the mission.

09:56.509 --> 09:58.340
Sounds like you've got everything set up.

09:58.411 --> 10:00.242
- British efficiency.
- British!

10:00.313 --> 10:02.577
Dear, no, my friend.

10:02.749 --> 10:04.148
I'm Welsh.

10:05.151 --> 10:07.381
It's a temporary alliance
against the Nazis, eh?

10:07.453 --> 10:10.616
Welsh madman. But then, all the Welsh
are a bit mad.

10:13.059 --> 10:16.358
That's possibly why
he's a most efficient secret agent.

10:18.131 --> 10:20.691
- You're in good hands.
- I'm sure of it.

10:21.000 --> 10:23.560
- When do we leave?
- Now. Within the hour.

10:24.871 --> 10:26.862
- Good luck, sir.
- Thank you, General.

11:09.782 --> 11:11.613
You're the busy one.

11:11.684 --> 11:14.244
Got a lot of things to clear up
before this weekend.

11:14.320 --> 11:16.185
That's what I wanted to talk to you about.

11:16.256 --> 11:18.747
The weekend. I thought maybe we could...

11:18.825 --> 11:21.555
go down to the beach
and splash in the water...

11:21.628 --> 11:23.323
lie on the sand...

11:23.396 --> 11:25.023
maybe drum up a little interest.

11:25.098 --> 11:27.828
I'd love to, but I've already
made plans for the weekend.

11:27.901 --> 11:29.459
Really? What're you gonna do?

11:29.535 --> 11:32.163
Well, you might say I'm going hunting.

11:32.805 --> 11:36.002
Hunting? Diana, you couldn't hurt a fly.

11:36.276 --> 11:38.574
I'm not going hunting to hurt anything.

11:38.678 --> 11:40.839
I'm going to find something.

11:42.148 --> 11:43.479
Hopefully.

12:06.105 --> 12:09.097
You have no idea
of how this mechanism works?

12:09.175 --> 12:12.303
Only that it connects
to some power source, sir.

12:12.378 --> 12:15.438
I trust Dr. Graebner will soon tell us more.

12:16.382 --> 12:18.213
We will begin analysis at once.

12:18.284 --> 12:20.946
Question: This Andros will cooperate?

12:22.155 --> 12:24.385
I think I can persuade him.

12:24.457 --> 12:26.254
And if you cannot...

12:27.860 --> 12:30.192
I have experts who can.

12:41.808 --> 12:44.641
"Lieutenant Felzer. " Good papers.

12:44.911 --> 12:46.105
The best.

12:46.446 --> 12:49.108
There really is a Lieutenant Felzer.

12:49.282 --> 12:51.716
He's on the Eastern front.
He'd better stay there.

12:51.784 --> 12:54.116
If he comes back, we will both be shot.

13:24.817 --> 13:27.285
Dr. Andros, welcome to Markheim!

13:27.353 --> 13:30.288
May I introduce Colonel-General
Heinrich Von Dreiberg.

13:30.356 --> 13:33.883
- Dr. Andros.
- No "Doctor," please. Just Andros.

13:34.293 --> 13:37.592
On my planet, we've given up
the custom of using titles.

13:38.531 --> 13:42.023
I'm Professor Graebner
of the Ministry of Science.

13:42.468 --> 13:45.266
And you, Dr. Andros, are you...

13:45.471 --> 13:48.304
an alien from outer space?

13:48.541 --> 13:50.975
I'm precisely what I claim to be.

13:52.145 --> 13:54.636
But you are involved in atom research?

13:54.781 --> 13:57.841
No, we completed
our atomic research long ago.

13:57.984 --> 14:00.976
Now our children learn
atomic and sub-atomic physics...

14:01.120 --> 14:04.681
in primary school much as
your children learn primitive fire making.

14:07.226 --> 14:08.989
Very interesting, Doctor.

14:09.062 --> 14:13.226
But let us leave serious talk for later.
Now, dinner.

14:13.332 --> 14:16.130
May I introduce Fräulein Engel.

14:17.537 --> 14:19.095
Shall we go in?

14:25.278 --> 14:26.267
Bjornsen.

14:30.349 --> 14:32.044
He is impertinent.

14:32.285 --> 14:35.777
And the ridiculous cover story
about an alien from outer space.

14:35.855 --> 14:39.757
Gentlemen, he has already admitted
his connection to atom research.

14:40.293 --> 14:44.457
We are convinced he is a key scientist
in the Allied scientific establishment...

14:44.530 --> 14:46.498
but like many scientists, he is naive.

14:46.632 --> 14:49.863
I think I can persuade him
to join our cause.

14:50.136 --> 14:51.797
And if you can't?

14:52.638 --> 14:55.732
Sir, perhaps Fräulein Engel can.

15:29.976 --> 15:32.137
I promised you, Andros...

15:32.578 --> 15:35.570
that we'd have a chance
to talk more privately.

15:35.648 --> 15:37.138
And more pleasantly.

15:37.216 --> 15:38.843
Well, I'm flattered.

15:42.889 --> 15:44.254
Thank you.

15:50.196 --> 15:51.185
Prosit.

15:55.868 --> 15:57.802
It's beautiful, bubbly.

15:59.205 --> 16:00.502
It's alive.

16:02.041 --> 16:04.737
It's too bad the sparkle
is so short-lived...

16:05.912 --> 16:07.436
and then it's dead.

16:08.481 --> 16:09.846
Tell me something.

16:10.583 --> 16:13.211
Why do you let yourself be used like this?

16:13.719 --> 16:15.516
A charming object...

16:15.721 --> 16:18.019
sent off to seduce a stranger.

16:20.059 --> 16:21.651
Love isn't a commodity.

16:22.528 --> 16:24.496
It is at least, a gift...

16:25.164 --> 16:26.893
at best, a sharing.

16:29.168 --> 16:31.728
You remember when you were a little girl?

16:32.471 --> 16:35.406
The ocean sunrises over Wesermunde.

16:36.876 --> 16:40.505
The golden dreams
of a knight come riding.

16:42.215 --> 16:44.012
How did you know?

16:44.083 --> 16:47.610
And the girl who knew she was beautiful.

16:53.159 --> 16:54.148
No!

16:56.729 --> 16:58.196
Touching.

17:03.469 --> 17:06.131
I see you've decided
to communicate with me again.

17:06.204 --> 17:09.402
You do have faith
in these primitives, Andros.

17:10.476 --> 17:12.944
It is a quality the Council needs.

17:14.380 --> 17:16.507
I'm exercising my privilege.

17:16.983 --> 17:20.612
I'm canceling the Judgment's survey
and bringing you back.

17:21.686 --> 17:23.382
And this planet Earth?

17:23.756 --> 17:25.314
Destroyed, of course.

17:25.925 --> 17:26.914
No.

17:27.792 --> 17:29.727
Andros, you must realize...

17:29.795 --> 17:32.855
your romantic faith
in these humans is false.

17:33.499 --> 17:36.127
They've captured you. They will kill you.

17:36.469 --> 17:38.630
No, they're not all savages.

17:39.672 --> 17:41.799
I'm an anachronism, Gorel.

17:42.408 --> 17:45.241
I'm a romantic. I still have faith.

17:45.645 --> 17:47.044
You're wrong.

17:47.480 --> 17:49.539
These people are savages.

17:50.449 --> 17:52.679
And if they kill you, Andros...

17:53.519 --> 17:55.510
I will lose a friend.

17:56.122 --> 17:59.023
And their planet will be destroyed
in any case.

18:31.357 --> 18:34.622
You have quite a remarkable collection
of artworks.

18:35.361 --> 18:39.092
An example
of our historic culture, Andros.

18:43.202 --> 18:44.567
Seize her!

18:47.239 --> 18:48.297
Come on, I'll get you out.

18:48.374 --> 18:50.365
No, wait!

18:51.143 --> 18:53.304
Wonder Woman, I can't leave yet.

18:53.379 --> 18:56.041
There's much to learn here
before I make a judgment.

18:56.115 --> 18:59.050
They're holding you prisoner!
They are Nazis.

18:59.452 --> 19:01.215
Yes, they are Nazis.

19:01.287 --> 19:03.448
Your friends
are Republicans and Democrats.

19:03.522 --> 19:06.958
The Russians are Communists.
All different, all human.

19:07.126 --> 19:10.527
I told you, I intend to meet
the leaders of humankind.

19:10.696 --> 19:12.755
- Including the Nazis?
- Yes.

19:23.175 --> 19:25.006
You brought me here by force...

19:25.077 --> 19:27.238
but I would stay
of my own will and necessity...

19:27.313 --> 19:30.111
- if you do not harm Wonder Woman.
- Of course.

19:30.950 --> 19:33.316
We'll make you a good Nazi yet, Andros!

19:33.386 --> 19:35.877
At the very least,
you are an honored guest.

19:38.090 --> 19:41.924
And you are quite a different kind of guest.

19:44.063 --> 19:45.690
Take them away.

19:52.571 --> 19:55.972
There is no doubt she is an Allied agent,
this Wonder Woman.

19:56.175 --> 19:58.575
So why do we play games, Bjornsen?

19:59.612 --> 20:02.172
Take her below and have her questioned.

20:02.248 --> 20:04.773
Questioned scientifically.

20:05.651 --> 20:08.085
With all due respect, I disagree.

20:08.154 --> 20:10.588
This Wonder Woman has been involved...

20:10.656 --> 20:13.318
in some very curious episodes in the past.

20:13.392 --> 20:16.555
There are reports
of extraordinary physical strength...

20:16.629 --> 20:19.120
- speed...
- Utter nonsense.

20:19.231 --> 20:20.721
She is a woman!

20:23.068 --> 20:24.865
An unusual woman?

20:30.009 --> 20:32.375
I suspect an experimental agent.

20:32.945 --> 20:37.405
Perhaps the result of scientific processing.

20:40.085 --> 20:43.054
Connected with this Dr. Andros?

20:43.489 --> 20:44.717
Very possibly.

20:44.790 --> 20:48.157
So I have arranged to leave them together.

20:49.428 --> 20:50.793
Privately...

20:51.130 --> 20:52.563
so to speak.

20:56.402 --> 20:57.926
I don't understand...

20:59.138 --> 21:02.471
how you can be friendly with the Nazis
when they've taken you prisoner!

21:02.541 --> 21:04.202
So did the Americans.

21:04.276 --> 21:07.336
But that was different,
for temporary security.

21:07.913 --> 21:12.179
Americans don't make arbitrary arrests
or use concentration camps.

21:13.085 --> 21:17.112
I think you better explain that
to Americans of Japanese descent.

21:19.391 --> 21:22.588
Democracies are not perfect.
I mean, there are...

21:24.296 --> 21:27.891
mistakes made
but not warfare against civilians.

21:28.133 --> 21:30.033
Not deliberate torture.

21:30.369 --> 21:33.395
Distinctions, not necessarily differences.

21:34.240 --> 21:38.472
I'm not interested in national squabbles.
I am here to study humanity.

21:39.144 --> 21:40.668
Or inhumanity.

21:40.913 --> 21:43.814
And you have no feelings,
one way or the other?

21:43.883 --> 21:46.010
I have very strong feelings.

21:46.485 --> 21:49.682
That's why I cannot indulge them,
believe me.

21:50.656 --> 21:52.851
I'm as vulnerable as you are.

21:53.225 --> 21:54.214
No.

21:55.694 --> 21:59.289
You're a guest of Bjornsen,
and his Nazi masters!

21:59.365 --> 22:02.198
Bjornsen is a Nazi
but all Germans are not Nazis.

22:02.368 --> 22:06.361
I cannot judge him, or his beliefs
until I understand them both.

22:07.740 --> 22:12.006
I am a prisoner, and thanks to you,
they have my Belt and my Lasso...

22:12.177 --> 22:13.940
so I am as helpless as you.

22:14.013 --> 22:17.244
Or else you would be
trying to tear this castle to pieces.

22:17.316 --> 22:18.305
Yes.

22:19.084 --> 22:21.416
Who would be waging warfare then?

22:24.690 --> 22:28.820
A few more days,
and he will be on our side.

22:30.729 --> 22:31.718
Good.

22:32.064 --> 22:35.795
I will need his help. I must confess...

22:36.302 --> 22:41.137
as of yet I don't understand the scientific
principles behind his mechanism...

22:41.707 --> 22:45.575
or the devices of that woman agent.

22:45.644 --> 22:47.544
Andros will cooperate.

22:47.713 --> 22:49.613
As for Wonder Woman...

22:50.249 --> 22:51.238
No.

22:52.217 --> 22:53.548
Nothing...

22:54.553 --> 22:56.316
will happen to her.

22:57.656 --> 23:01.183
Until she gives us
the information we want.

23:01.460 --> 23:03.257
I'll be careful.

23:15.574 --> 23:17.667
All in order, Captain Braun.

23:19.278 --> 23:22.736
But your case is slightly different,
Lieutenant Felzer.

23:23.082 --> 23:24.344
In what way?

23:24.416 --> 23:27.681
Your papers indicate you have recently
served on the Eastern front...

23:27.753 --> 23:30.483
- von Paulus' command.
- Yes. So?

23:30.589 --> 23:34.525
As it happens, we have another man
just back from the Eastern front...

23:34.994 --> 23:39.488
Lieutenant Berghoff, also served
under von Paulus, also in headquarters.

23:41.934 --> 23:44.334
You two must have known each other.

23:45.671 --> 23:48.572
Of course, it's possible, Captain Grau.

23:48.874 --> 23:50.637
I'd like to meet him.

23:50.709 --> 23:52.506
- Lieutenant Felzer.
- Sir?

23:52.578 --> 23:54.705
You have forgotten,
your social life must wait...

23:54.780 --> 23:57.476
until after we have delivered
the dispatches.

23:58.584 --> 24:01.280
Your General von Dreiberg
is waiting for them personally.

24:01.353 --> 24:02.945
If they are delayed...

24:03.322 --> 24:06.485
Lieutenant Felzer will undoubtedly
return to the Eastern front.

24:06.558 --> 24:09.322
- And we will accompany him.
- I apologize, sir!

24:10.062 --> 24:12.394
Of course we can't have delays...

24:12.564 --> 24:16.398
but I had Berghoff notified,
he was eager to meet an old comrade.

24:16.702 --> 24:18.329
Some other time.

24:21.807 --> 24:24.002
Dispatches for General von Dreiberg.

24:24.443 --> 24:25.933
Thank you, Captain.

24:38.223 --> 24:41.556
I'm only asking
for a few simple explanations.

24:42.294 --> 24:44.956
We realize, of course,
that these devices are connected...

24:45.030 --> 24:47.396
to your American atom research.

24:47.666 --> 24:48.997
Nonsense.

24:49.902 --> 24:52.302
I expected you to be stubborn.

24:53.706 --> 24:57.540
But you, Dr. Andros,
I'm sure you can give us some details?

24:58.677 --> 25:01.612
Do the Americans
have an atom bomb yet?

25:02.347 --> 25:05.043
Herr Bjornsen, I'm here
to meet with your leaders.

25:05.117 --> 25:07.642
Not discuss dangerous toys.

25:09.555 --> 25:11.989
You call the most powerful
explosive device...

25:12.057 --> 25:14.753
known to scientific theory a toy?

25:15.594 --> 25:18.358
I'm sorry,
I don't mean to be condescending.

25:18.430 --> 25:20.523
But my people discovered basic atomics...

25:20.599 --> 25:22.760
some thousands of your years ago and...

25:23.702 --> 25:24.999
we experimented with it...

25:25.070 --> 25:28.335
and then outgrew
the uses of such power, such weapons.

25:28.774 --> 25:33.108
We developed other uses: More effective,
less clumsy and polluting.

25:33.612 --> 25:36.604
- Enough of this other-world nonsense!
- Please.

25:37.149 --> 25:38.810
Let him continue.

25:40.018 --> 25:43.579
We know planets where
atomic explosives were discovered...

25:43.655 --> 25:46.283
leading to war and destruction...

25:46.825 --> 25:51.159
and the planets did not survive.
Earth is entering the atomic age...

25:51.830 --> 25:55.960
and if you do not outgrow
your emotional primitivism...

25:56.835 --> 25:59.736
you'll destroy yourselves, and others.

26:01.607 --> 26:04.735
It is that we cannot allow.

26:15.954 --> 26:19.082
Where's Felzer? Sorry.

26:19.358 --> 26:24.125
I'm Lieutenant Berghoff. Felzer and I
were pretty close on the Eastern front.

26:24.496 --> 26:26.225
Berghoff, too bad!

26:27.065 --> 26:30.796
You just missed him.
He just went through a few minutes ago.

26:30.869 --> 26:33.963
Then, perhaps, I can see him
when he comes out.

26:34.072 --> 26:37.530
He still has a uniform of mine
that he borrowed...

26:37.943 --> 26:39.740
and I'd like to get it back.

26:40.078 --> 26:43.104
It must have been
a very loose fit on you, Lieutenant.

26:43.916 --> 26:45.713
No, as a matter of fact...

26:45.784 --> 26:48.514
it's just about the best-fitting
uniform I own.

26:48.654 --> 26:51.680
But you can't be more than 5'9", 5'10"...

26:52.724 --> 26:55.192
Felzer's at least 6'2", 6'3".

26:56.795 --> 26:58.285
Georg Felzer?

26:59.097 --> 27:02.965
Impossible. He and I are
exactly the same height!

27:04.403 --> 27:06.428
- Are you sure?
- Positive.

27:07.706 --> 27:11.005
Whoever he is, that man's an imposter.

27:16.114 --> 27:19.572
Get me Oberst Bjornsen at once.
Emergency!

27:21.954 --> 27:23.148
I see.

27:24.556 --> 27:27.389
Thank you, Captain Grau. We'll handle it.

27:40.639 --> 27:42.539
General Von Dreiberg.

27:43.442 --> 27:46.343
Major Trevor, how nice to see you again.

27:50.983 --> 27:52.450
Disarm them!

28:03.028 --> 28:04.893
Wonder Woman, you, too?

28:06.498 --> 28:09.956
I came to free Andros.
But he doesn't want to be freed.

28:11.136 --> 28:14.071
Dr. Andros has become friendly.

28:15.307 --> 28:17.400
But I think, Doctor, the time has come...

28:17.476 --> 28:21.003
for you to give us a concrete
demonstration of that friendship.

28:22.948 --> 28:24.347
To be specific:

28:24.983 --> 28:28.544
We know you're a key scientist
in the American atom program.

28:30.355 --> 28:31.822
We've been patient.

28:32.224 --> 28:36.251
Those colorful stories of alien space.

28:36.995 --> 28:38.758
But now: Facts.

28:39.264 --> 28:41.926
- I told you.
- You told us charming fairytales!

28:42.000 --> 28:45.663
The Third Reich is at war.
We need weapons. Atomic weapons.

28:45.971 --> 28:46.995
No.

28:50.542 --> 28:52.635
I think you're confused, Doctor.

28:53.312 --> 28:55.280
I'm not asking you politely.

28:55.547 --> 28:58.311
I have the top American female agent...

28:59.117 --> 29:02.280
the head of
an American Intelligence operation...

29:02.921 --> 29:05.981
and the leading British spy
in the Third Reich!

29:06.291 --> 29:09.158
I have them! And you will see them die!

29:11.029 --> 29:15.625
- You don't understand! Why don't you...
- It is you who does not understand.

29:16.601 --> 29:18.262
The talk is over!

29:19.638 --> 29:22.129
Take them down. For questioning.

29:48.467 --> 29:50.458
I'd get nightmares like this.

29:50.535 --> 29:53.299
But I wasn't lucky enough
to have you in them, Princess.

29:53.372 --> 29:57.069
This leads to the wine cellar,
which we have enlarged.

29:57.376 --> 30:01.642
This whole section of the foundation
was carved out of living rock.

30:01.780 --> 30:05.181
It took us a year
and a good deal of forced labor.

30:05.984 --> 30:09.249
The ultimate plague:
Man's inhumanity to man.

30:09.488 --> 30:12.048
Rather the strong's use of the weak.

30:12.457 --> 30:15.221
Not pretty, Dr. Andros,
but the truth behind...

30:15.293 --> 30:17.625
all power, all governments: Strength.

30:17.896 --> 30:20.990
The strength of a frightened, evil child...

30:22.267 --> 30:24.895
too terrified to trust in gentleness.

30:27.039 --> 30:30.600
Only in paradise, Wonder Woman.

30:31.243 --> 30:32.642
I hope not.

30:37.716 --> 30:40.981
You will see we have modernized it a bit.

30:48.193 --> 30:50.024
Have them cover all exits.

30:51.229 --> 30:52.890
Put them in there.

30:55.000 --> 30:57.093
We'll go to the laboratory.

30:57.636 --> 30:58.796
Get your hands off...

30:58.870 --> 31:01.998
Don't confuse heroism with stupidity.

31:02.074 --> 31:04.872
You are a hundred meters down in
the heart of the mountain.

31:04.943 --> 31:06.877
You have very few options.

31:07.012 --> 31:09.139
He's right, Steve, for now.

31:10.282 --> 31:12.682
Look, you, the war isn't over yet.

31:13.852 --> 31:15.843
But don't worry, Colonel.

31:15.954 --> 31:19.788
I'll notify you when we've won.
If you're still alive.

31:35.006 --> 31:38.100
Professor Graebner has been
examining your devices.

31:39.044 --> 31:43.504
And I must admit, up till now
I've made very little progress.

31:43.582 --> 31:47.416
This is clearly a control mechanism
of some kind...

31:47.486 --> 31:50.649
operating on electronic principles.

31:51.690 --> 31:54.386
These artifacts...

31:55.660 --> 31:57.184
They are gifts.

31:57.963 --> 31:59.726
But what do they do?

32:00.098 --> 32:03.556
How do they function?
I want detailed technical data.

32:04.069 --> 32:05.331
There are none.

32:05.504 --> 32:08.496
- You're being stubborn.
- And stupid!

32:09.107 --> 32:13.237
Let us start with your device,
Dr. Andros. You will explain it.

32:13.879 --> 32:15.904
Even if I were willing,
it would be impossible.

32:15.981 --> 32:18.381
You don't have the scientific knowledge.

32:18.450 --> 32:19.917
It's not a machine.

32:20.218 --> 32:23.016
It's part of my mind,
perhaps, part of my soul.

32:23.088 --> 32:26.615
That is mystic nonsense, and I want facts!

32:26.758 --> 32:28.123
I'm sorry. No.

32:29.027 --> 32:31.359
I'm disappointed, Andros.

32:32.164 --> 32:33.688
Let me be clear.

32:34.099 --> 32:36.727
If you refuse to cooperate...

32:37.002 --> 32:39.562
- You'll use force on me?
- No.

32:42.040 --> 32:43.268
On her.

32:45.010 --> 32:47.171
While you watch.

32:52.517 --> 32:54.144
They are savages.

32:56.888 --> 32:58.788
They have convinced me.

32:59.124 --> 33:00.614
You are right.

33:02.394 --> 33:05.522
I am a terrible threat to your planet,
and yet you are here...

33:05.597 --> 33:07.758
at risk of life, to help me...

33:07.933 --> 33:10.868
and so is Major Trevor, and Evan Mallory.

33:11.102 --> 33:13.229
The Americans, the Allies...

33:13.305 --> 33:16.968
they have human virtues, human flaws...

33:18.009 --> 33:22.173
- but the Nazis...
- I don't need a lecture on ethics!

33:22.414 --> 33:24.541
Nor would you understand it.

33:26.151 --> 33:28.915
You spoke to me
of your cultural inheritance.

33:29.120 --> 33:33.454
Your inheritance is in a direct line
with Genghis Khan, Attila.

33:33.592 --> 33:36.618
You celebrate the darkness
in the human soul.

33:37.329 --> 33:38.819
Start on her!

33:41.700 --> 33:42.689
Gorel!

34:17.101 --> 34:18.091
Stop her!

34:39.591 --> 34:42.889
If we could break up this bunk
we could use it as a battering ram.

34:43.527 --> 34:45.688
Lock all the exits, stop Wonder Woman.

35:49.194 --> 35:51.822
Whatever happened, my dear princess...

35:53.465 --> 35:57.367
your coming here to help me
has renewed my faith in humankind.

36:01.706 --> 36:03.799
I'm stripped of my powers.

36:06.244 --> 36:10.408
The only way I can return to my spacecraft
safely is with human help.

36:11.516 --> 36:13.780
And I will have made a point.

36:14.519 --> 36:15.781
If I'm killed...

36:16.287 --> 36:19.051
Then it would prove we aren't civilized.

36:19.724 --> 36:21.282
And then Earth...

36:22.527 --> 36:23.619
Would end.

36:26.698 --> 36:28.962
And you have risked your life for us.

36:29.100 --> 36:31.193
No, for what I believe in.

36:32.337 --> 36:34.271
I don't risk my life:

36:35.140 --> 36:37.904
My life is what I believe in.

37:09.741 --> 37:12.301
Too bloody well-made,
bloody perfectionists.

37:40.205 --> 37:41.467
Go after them.

37:55.487 --> 37:56.476
That way!

38:27.318 --> 38:28.307
Go on.

38:42.800 --> 38:45.098
No, she's here to help us.

38:45.169 --> 38:48.002
- How do you know you can trust her?
- Andros knows.

38:48.940 --> 38:53.377
I don't care about the rest of you
but I won't see him killed!

38:53.678 --> 38:54.667
This way.

39:15.033 --> 39:17.058
A secret exit. In case of heavy bombing.

39:17.135 --> 39:20.798
You can break the door, there's a
tunnel that leads past the security points.

39:20.872 --> 39:21.861
Thank you.

39:24.609 --> 39:26.600
- Thank you, Lisa.
- Don't.

39:27.712 --> 39:29.942
- I don't even know why.
- I do.

39:30.582 --> 39:34.245
And when that knight comes riding
he'll know, too.

39:50.068 --> 39:51.797
I'm no longer important...

39:51.869 --> 39:55.498
but Wonder Woman is. Surely
by now you've seen the potential...

39:55.640 --> 39:56.971
for good in humans.

39:57.041 --> 39:59.737
Wonder Woman is the hope
of the human race.

39:59.811 --> 40:03.076
The hope of this entire misguided planet.

40:03.581 --> 40:06.482
Grant me back my powers
that I may help her.

40:16.494 --> 40:18.428
Do you have your powers back?

40:18.830 --> 40:20.798
Yes, because of you.

40:34.278 --> 40:36.838
- Has the decision been reached, Andros?
- Yes.

40:38.049 --> 40:40.244
We found war, violence...

40:40.652 --> 40:43.280
injustice and torture.

40:43.354 --> 40:48.018
Your planet is troubled.
Humankind is flawed with self-destruction.

40:48.292 --> 40:49.987
But that is only a flaw.

40:50.194 --> 40:52.719
It's the disease of racial childhood.

40:52.864 --> 40:54.263
I found a balance.

40:54.632 --> 40:57.294
And I remember how you gave me back
my power:

40:57.368 --> 40:59.427
Freely, ethically.

41:00.171 --> 41:02.298
Then the Earth won't be destroyed?

41:02.407 --> 41:05.865
No, the spirit be thanked.
I won a vote in the Council.

41:09.547 --> 41:11.777
Fifty of your years, Princess.

41:13.151 --> 41:15.984
I am empowered to grant you that:
50 years.

41:17.121 --> 41:19.316
And you'll have atomic power...

41:19.390 --> 41:21.119
you'll begin to explore space...

41:21.192 --> 41:25.253
- I hope you discover answers.
- We will.

41:28.166 --> 41:30.930
No, we may.

41:33.071 --> 41:34.504
It's a question.

41:35.306 --> 41:39.299
Perhaps the next 50 years
will give us something of an answer.

41:39.944 --> 41:43.038
I can answer in regards to you, Princess.

41:43.247 --> 41:45.647
And I can offer you an invitation.

41:46.684 --> 41:48.151
Come with me.

41:49.353 --> 41:52.117
- Into space?
- Yes, to the real world.

41:52.190 --> 41:56.024
A planet of water,
and a civilization of dolphins...

41:56.794 --> 42:01.026
a planet of gardens,
where you can meet plant intelligences...

42:01.265 --> 42:04.234
a planet where
the gravity allows you to fly.

42:04.368 --> 42:06.563
There are thousands of worlds...

42:06.637 --> 42:09.902
you can see them,
you can even taste them if you wish.

42:10.808 --> 42:12.742
Then spend some time with me.

42:14.045 --> 42:15.034
Us.

42:17.281 --> 42:18.612
On my home.

42:19.884 --> 42:23.513
I can't. Andros, I'm pledged as well...

42:24.355 --> 42:25.720
to my Earth...

42:26.691 --> 42:28.784
humanity and my destiny.

42:29.494 --> 42:30.859
Of course.

42:34.465 --> 42:35.989
It's only 50 years.

42:38.603 --> 42:43.404
In 1992, I'll be back and renew my offer.

44:04.455 --> 44:05.649
Hi, Diana.

44:07.425 --> 44:09.791
The General still in with Steve?

44:12.396 --> 44:14.387
I know that look.

44:15.533 --> 44:16.864
Who's the fella?

44:17.301 --> 44:19.360
I'm sorry, I didn't hear what you said.

44:19.437 --> 44:21.564
I said you were thinking about a guy.

44:21.639 --> 44:25.268
And I want to hear all about it,
in minute detail.

44:25.476 --> 44:28.877
As a matter of fact,
I was thinking about someone...

44:29.347 --> 44:32.783
- but by this time he is very far away.
- Overseas?

44:33.751 --> 44:35.116
You might say so.

44:35.319 --> 44:37.981
Don't worry, he'll be back.

44:38.055 --> 44:42.082
I'm not worried. He'll come back,
I know, he promised.

44:42.159 --> 44:44.559
And he seems to be a man of his word.

44:46.964 --> 44:51.094
The White House just called. The President
wants your final report on Andros.

44:51.569 --> 44:52.797
Final report?

44:53.337 --> 44:55.498
The man's vanished
from the face of the earth...

44:55.573 --> 44:58.201
that's about the only final report
I can make.

45:00.645 --> 45:01.907
The General's right.

45:01.979 --> 45:05.471
How do we know it's a final report
if we can't find a trace of Andros?

45:05.549 --> 45:09.383
From what you told me, Andros was
the most honest man you'd ever met...

45:09.654 --> 45:12.885
he said he was going back
to his own planet, why doubt him?

45:12.957 --> 45:13.946
I don't.

45:14.692 --> 45:17.718
I guess I'm just a little jealous,
that's all.

45:18.963 --> 45:21.830
I saw the way Wonder Woman
looked at him...

45:22.133 --> 45:24.966
and just wanted to make 100% sure
he is gone.

45:25.036 --> 45:28.062
I don't think you have
anything to worry about.

45:28.606 --> 45:30.699
No matter how much Andros
would have wanted...

45:30.775 --> 45:32.709
Wonder Woman to go back with him...

45:32.777 --> 45:35.610
I'm sure she'd rather stay here with you.

45:36.213 --> 45:37.475
With us.

46:37.508 --> 46:38.497
