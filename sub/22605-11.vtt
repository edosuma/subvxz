WEBVTT

00:04.948 --> 00:06.349
- Hi.
- Hey.

00:06.350 --> 00:07.773
Thanks, Richard.

00:07.774 --> 00:09.975
Thanks for coming. It's a really big help.

00:09.976 --> 00:11.543
Oh. Hey, no problem.

00:11.544 --> 00:13.688
So, uh,

00:13.689 --> 00:15.457
what am I, uh, helping with?

00:15.458 --> 00:17.859
Henry and I suddenly
decided to go to the movies,

00:17.860 --> 00:19.127
and Stevie's working late,

00:19.128 --> 00:21.296
so you are here to help watch the kids.

00:21.297 --> 00:22.530
- Oh. Great.
- Hi.

00:22.531 --> 00:23.690
What movie are you gonna see?

00:23.691 --> 00:25.525
We're not. That's the story.

00:25.526 --> 00:28.595
It reinforces that you're here
as a friend, not as a CIA agent.

00:28.596 --> 00:30.564
Oh, well, good thing your kids are grown.

00:30.565 --> 00:32.424
I couldn't really pull
off the baby-sitting cover.

00:32.424 --> 00:34.463
- All right, what have you got?
- The bank account

00:34.464 --> 00:36.937
number that Nadine gave
you in Caracas is registered

00:36.938 --> 00:38.371
to a dummy corporation.

00:38.372 --> 00:40.573
âKliborne Oil and Gas.â

00:40.574 --> 00:41.875
Who has access to it?

00:41.876 --> 00:43.243
Three signatories.

00:43.244 --> 00:47.013
âLouis Donald, Carlotta
Taniston and Marie Porter.â

00:47.014 --> 00:48.494
All pseudonyms?

00:48.495 --> 00:50.183
Couldn't get a positive
I.D. on any of them.

00:50.184 --> 00:51.551
So there's no way to find out how much

00:51.552 --> 00:52.752
Secretary Marsh had in the account.

00:52.753 --> 00:53.887
Or how it got there.

00:53.888 --> 00:55.822
Well, not unless you know one of 'em.

00:55.823 --> 00:57.357
Why do I have the feeling

00:57.358 --> 00:59.692
you're about to show off some
bad-ass analytical skills?

00:59.693 --> 01:03.563
There was an English
student at Cornell in 1984

01:03.564 --> 01:05.298
who did her senior thesis
under the supervision

01:05.299 --> 01:07.867
of Dr. Malcolm Taniston, a world-renowned

01:07.868 --> 01:10.036
scholar on Victorian literature.

01:10.037 --> 01:12.672
Her thesis was on
Charlotte Bronte. Charlotte.

01:12.673 --> 01:15.408
Carlotta. Taniston.

01:15.409 --> 01:18.177
That is a stretch.

01:18.178 --> 01:21.314
Not considering who that student was.

01:21.315 --> 01:22.548
Nadine Tolliver.

01:22.549 --> 01:24.250
Your chief of staff wasn't

01:24.251 --> 01:27.253
completely forthcoming on
her knowledge of the account.

01:27.254 --> 01:28.921
So Nadine can get us into the account.

01:28.922 --> 01:30.890
Only if you're willing
to trust her that far.

01:30.891 --> 01:32.658
Don't have much choice.

01:32.659 --> 01:34.861
Okay, but even if you get her on board,

01:34.862 --> 01:37.263
her account is only accessible in person.

01:37.264 --> 01:38.865
Biometrics,

01:38.866 --> 01:41.366
fingerprints, iris scans.

01:44.203 --> 01:46.038
We're going to Caracas.

01:46.039 --> 01:47.406
- What?
- What?

01:47.407 --> 01:49.308
I'm supposed to go on a goodwill tour

01:49.309 --> 01:50.930
of South America, and we've been debating

01:50.931 --> 01:52.856
about whether or not Venezuela
should be on the list,

01:52.857 --> 01:54.444
- and this settles it.
- There's so many things

01:54.445 --> 01:55.367
wrong with that idea.

01:55.368 --> 01:56.649
Yeah, yeah, he's right.

01:56.650 --> 01:58.718
Starting with, President
Suarez hates the United States

01:58.719 --> 02:00.853
and will loudly and publicly
refuse to receive you.

02:00.854 --> 02:04.023
I will change his opinion
with my irrepressible

02:04.024 --> 02:05.391
diplomatic charm.

02:05.392 --> 02:08.193
What, and go snooping around
some money-laundering bank?

02:08.195 --> 02:09.428
I'm gonna start the campaign

02:09.429 --> 02:11.297
- to get in President Suarez's good graces.
- Wait.

02:11.298 --> 02:12.712
Someone's got to put the brakes on here...

02:12.713 --> 02:13.776
- what are we doing?
- We agreed.

02:13.777 --> 02:16.201
We all said that we were
gonna see this through.

02:16.202 --> 02:17.603
No, we agreed to embark.
I reserve the right

02:17.604 --> 02:19.538
- to say when we've done...
- You're the one that said

02:19.539 --> 02:21.273
that it was important to know
what we were dealing with.

02:21.274 --> 02:24.408
Our only form of protection,
remember? You said that.

02:27.134 --> 02:28.514
Well, you're not going without me.

02:28.515 --> 02:31.450
Great. Find a sub and get on my plane.

02:31.451 --> 02:34.286
Okay, we gotta find
someone to watch the kids.

02:34.287 --> 02:36.054
I only do fake baby-sitting.

02:36.055 --> 02:37.890
We'll figure that one out.

02:37.891 --> 02:39.057
Listen, while I'm away,

02:39.058 --> 02:41.393
I want you to run some
Intel on Russell Jackson.

02:41.394 --> 02:43.684
I can't believe you can look
that guy in the face every day.

02:43.685 --> 02:45.397
Oh, I can't, not knowing

02:45.398 --> 02:47.966
if he and the president
were behind Marsh's murder.

02:47.967 --> 02:51.203
Okay, done. Shouldn't you two
pretend to go to the movies now?

02:51.204 --> 02:52.704
Oh, yeah.

02:52.705 --> 02:54.272
All right, okay, uh, can we pretend

02:54.273 --> 02:55.807
to go to an action movie?

02:55.808 --> 02:58.677
I'm not pretending to go to some
period piece... English accent,

02:58.678 --> 02:59.911
the whole, like, the subtitle...

02:59.912 --> 03:02.152
- Right, right, okay.
- Bye.

03:04.149 --> 03:06.751
So, about this goodwill
trip to South America.

03:06.752 --> 03:09.020
- What about it?
- It's exciting.

03:09.021 --> 03:11.523
We're gonna be having fun in the sun.

03:11.524 --> 03:14.125
Spreading cheer in the hemisphere.

03:14.126 --> 03:16.161
Feeling fine below the line.

03:16.162 --> 03:17.662
Well...

03:17.663 --> 03:19.331
Venezuela is actually north of the equator.

03:19.332 --> 03:22.100
Wait, I thought Venezuela
was off the table.

03:22.101 --> 03:23.335
Well, apparently, it's back on.

03:23.336 --> 03:24.469
Didn't you read the memo?

03:24.470 --> 03:27.105
Yes...

03:27.106 --> 03:28.406
You were saying?

03:28.407 --> 03:30.408
Did you get one of these?

03:30.409 --> 03:31.810
Mm...

03:31.811 --> 03:35.213
It's the DS-760, and if we both sign it,

03:35.214 --> 03:38.683
it just states that we're
in a mutually satisfactory

03:38.684 --> 03:40.251
and non-coercive relationship.

03:40.252 --> 03:43.488
So that no one files a harassment claim.

03:43.489 --> 03:45.657
That... that is one way of looking at it.

03:45.658 --> 03:47.525
The other is

03:47.526 --> 03:51.229
that it lets us be together
in a bigger hotel room

03:51.230 --> 03:53.298
- while traveling.
- Oh.

03:53.299 --> 03:55.700
Talking king-size suite, matching robes.

03:55.701 --> 03:56.601
Mm-hmm.

03:56.602 --> 03:57.669
Porn on demand.

03:57.670 --> 04:00.305
- Oh.
- I mean art films on demand.

04:00.306 --> 04:01.673
Dirty art films.

04:01.674 --> 04:04.275
I think my non-coerced
heart just skipped a beat.

04:04.276 --> 04:07.011
Well, if we both sign,
we'll travel in style.

04:07.012 --> 04:09.580
Look, I only broke off my
engagement two weeks ago.

04:09.581 --> 04:12.083
And I don't want to sign some official form

04:12.084 --> 04:14.185
that everyone in HR gets to see.

04:14.186 --> 04:18.954
Okay. Maybe I'll give you
a chance to read it over.

04:22.360 --> 04:23.794
No big surprise,

04:23.795 --> 04:26.264
President Suarez has
refused our request to visit.

04:26.265 --> 04:27.698
Straight up or with a twist?

04:27.699 --> 04:28.933
According to the Consular Office,

04:28.934 --> 04:30.267
his exact words were,

04:30.268 --> 04:32.670
âYour imperialist propaganda
is not welcome here.â

04:32.671 --> 04:34.205
Pretty definitive.

04:34.206 --> 04:36.073
This is diplomacy. Nothing is definitive.

04:36.074 --> 04:38.042
Except that Venezuela is a hot mess

04:38.043 --> 04:40.711
right now... anti-government
protests, 15 opposition leaders

04:40.712 --> 04:42.313
placed under house arrest.

04:42.314 --> 04:44.215
The economy is in crisis.

04:44.216 --> 04:47.051
President Suarez is amping
up his anti-American rhetoric.

04:47.052 --> 04:48.463
It's going to be tough, persuading him.

04:48.464 --> 04:49.620
President Suarez is talking about

04:49.621 --> 04:51.655
cancelling the upcoming election.

04:51.656 --> 04:53.457
And you want

04:53.458 --> 04:54.491
to talk him out of it?

04:54.492 --> 04:55.793
I want to try.

04:55.794 --> 04:57.586
But I got to get through the door first.

04:57.587 --> 04:59.029
Well, we could pare back the language

04:59.030 --> 05:01.210
in your official South
American tour statement.

05:01.211 --> 05:02.199
Make it less threatening.

05:02.200 --> 05:04.468
No, I want to be absolutely
clear about our intentions.

05:04.469 --> 05:06.170
Then you have to sweeten the pot.

05:06.171 --> 05:07.938
Without caving on policy.

05:07.939 --> 05:10.774
So, are we at crazy ideas?

05:10.775 --> 05:12.876
- Always.
- We can try

05:12.877 --> 05:13.944
celebrity diplomacy.

05:13.945 --> 05:15.946
Suarez craves fame and adoration.

05:15.947 --> 05:17.247
And he also happens

05:17.248 --> 05:19.283
to love baseball.

05:19.284 --> 05:20.918
Right. He's a fanatic.

05:20.919 --> 05:22.949
Personally coaches the
Venezuelan national team.

05:22.950 --> 05:23.821
I give you

05:23.822 --> 05:25.455
Manny Azucco,

05:25.456 --> 05:27.457
one of the greatest ballplayers ever.

05:27.458 --> 05:29.760
Fifteenth on the list of all-time hitters.

05:29.761 --> 05:31.528
Eleven trips to the All-Star Game,

05:31.529 --> 05:34.531
three World Series rings,
and he is easy on the eyes.

05:34.532 --> 05:35.632
- Oh, yes.
- Right?

05:35.633 --> 05:37.501
- We get it.
- I think it's a great idea.

05:37.502 --> 05:38.769
He's big in the U.S.,

05:38.770 --> 05:41.171
but he's a God in
Venezuela, where he was born.

05:41.172 --> 05:42.739
Exactly. He just retired,

05:42.740 --> 05:44.574
- and he's hotter than ever.
- Okay.

05:44.575 --> 05:45.442
Well, he is.

05:45.443 --> 05:47.344
Ma'am, we get Manny Azucco

05:47.345 --> 05:49.312
to come along, El
Presidente might go for it.

05:49.313 --> 05:50.981
You think you can pull this off, Daisy?

05:50.982 --> 05:53.450
I took the liberty of
contacting his people.

05:53.451 --> 05:55.051
He's very open to the idea.

05:55.052 --> 05:58.321
All right, let's make the official call.

05:58.322 --> 06:01.291
Get Mr. Azucco on board, see
if President Suarez responds.

06:01.292 --> 06:03.225
Thank you, everyone.

06:04.361 --> 06:05.562
- Matt?
- Yeah.

06:05.563 --> 06:07.430
- Hang back for a minute.
- Okay.

06:07.431 --> 06:10.433
I know you have your meeting
coming up with Jackson.

06:10.434 --> 06:13.737
- Oh, yeah, that meeting.
- Right.

06:13.738 --> 06:15.872
How are you feeling?

06:15.873 --> 06:19.008
Ma'am, I never give him
anything but the official line.

06:19.009 --> 06:20.643
Things you'd tell him yourself.

06:20.644 --> 06:22.579
I know.

06:22.580 --> 06:23.980
And with all due respect,

06:23.981 --> 06:26.449
how much longer do I
need to keep doing this?

06:26.450 --> 06:27.984
Being your double agent guy?

06:27.985 --> 06:30.053
A little bit longer.

06:30.054 --> 06:31.654
We need to up the game.

06:31.655 --> 06:33.122
As in...?

06:33.123 --> 06:35.058
Give him some real information.

06:35.059 --> 06:37.193
Something I wouldn't
normally tell him about.

06:37.194 --> 06:38.728
What would that be?

06:38.729 --> 06:40.663
It has to do with my recent meeting

06:40.664 --> 06:41.864
with the Israeli delegation...

06:41.865 --> 06:45.301
a private conversation I
had with Ambassador Dori.

06:45.302 --> 06:47.270
Okay.

06:47.271 --> 06:51.207
Tell him we met, you overhead
something about Dubai.

06:51.208 --> 06:53.442
- Dubai?
- Yeah.

06:53.443 --> 06:54.610
That's it?

06:54.611 --> 06:57.447
- Just Dubai?
- Yeah.

06:57.448 --> 07:00.616
Nothing in particular about Dubai?

07:00.617 --> 07:02.518
No.

07:02.519 --> 07:04.353
Okay, fine.

07:04.354 --> 07:06.622
Um, what if he asks questions?

07:06.623 --> 07:08.190
That's all you know.

07:08.191 --> 07:10.393
That's really good,
because that is all I know.

07:10.394 --> 07:12.762
- I know.
- Great.

07:12.763 --> 07:16.165
If confusion is an
asset, then I am your man.

07:16.166 --> 07:17.632
You are.

07:18.868 --> 07:20.002
Thanks, Matt.

07:20.003 --> 07:21.804
Oh.

07:25.875 --> 07:29.277
Madam Secretary, you wanted to see me?

07:30.045 --> 07:32.047
This name...

07:32.048 --> 07:34.415
mean anything to you?

07:37.820 --> 07:39.521
Should it?

07:39.522 --> 07:42.256
Are you Carlotta Taniston?

07:42.925 --> 07:45.394
Yes.

07:45.395 --> 07:47.563
Did you help set up that bank account?

07:47.564 --> 07:49.198
You engaged

07:49.199 --> 07:52.568
in a financial transaction
using a false identity.

07:52.569 --> 07:54.837
Do you have any idea

07:54.838 --> 07:59.508
how many U.S. and international
fraud laws you've broken?

07:59.509 --> 08:02.144
Yes. I lost my mind.

08:02.145 --> 08:03.436
I thought I was in love. I...

08:03.437 --> 08:05.837
This isn't about you and your
broken heart anymore, Nadine.

08:05.838 --> 08:06.606
I...

08:06.607 --> 08:09.040
You need to tell me
everything you know right now.

08:11.720 --> 08:15.023
I went with Vincent on
every trip down to his ranch.

08:15.024 --> 08:17.025
Obviously not the last one.

08:17.026 --> 08:18.960
On the trip before that, he asked me

08:18.961 --> 08:21.063
to make a deposit at a private bank.

08:21.064 --> 08:23.699
This was one that required
not just a passport,

08:23.700 --> 08:26.601
but also fingerprints and an eye scan.

08:26.602 --> 08:31.206
I was to sign it using our
code name, Carlotta Taniston.

08:31.207 --> 08:33.674
Ma'am...

08:33.676 --> 08:35.409
I'm sorry.

08:35.410 --> 08:36.711
You didn't think there was

08:36.712 --> 08:38.780
anything weird about this transaction?

08:38.780 --> 08:41.283
- I mean, what were you thinking?
- Well, I wasn't thinking!

08:41.284 --> 08:44.152
But he said, âOh, this is money for us.

08:44.153 --> 08:45.620
It's for after the divorceâ.

08:45.621 --> 08:46.830
And this was so that

08:46.831 --> 08:48.999
his wife wouldn't know about
it and couldn't access it.

08:49.000 --> 08:51.659
She's an attorney, and she
had a lot of reach, and...

08:51.660 --> 08:55.196
Ma'am...

08:55.197 --> 08:57.732
when you changed the
itinerary to include Venezuela,

08:57.733 --> 08:59.701
this is why, isn't it?

08:59.702 --> 09:01.235
Yes.

09:02.403 --> 09:06.474
But you and I are the only two
people who are gonna know that.

09:06.475 --> 09:09.310
Thank you.

09:09.311 --> 09:12.680
And now you need me to access the account.

09:12.681 --> 09:16.416
Might be the only way we
ever find out the truth.

09:18.086 --> 09:21.087
I will help you find it.

09:23.091 --> 09:25.093
Madam Secretary, Mr. Jackson is...

09:25.094 --> 09:26.694
You going to Venezuela?

09:26.695 --> 09:29.029
Uh... that's the plan.

09:30.431 --> 09:33.534
I was going to tell you
when it was made official.

09:33.535 --> 09:36.471
Their hostility to the
U.S. is only outmatched

09:36.472 --> 09:38.606
by their dedication to corruption.

09:38.607 --> 09:40.308
What on earth are you hoping to achieve?

09:40.309 --> 09:44.478
Damage repair, superficial engagement,

09:44.479 --> 09:46.714
stop bad from going to worse.

09:47.849 --> 09:49.917
Vincent Marsh always seemed

09:49.918 --> 09:51.719
a little too interested in that place.

09:51.720 --> 09:53.821
It's not just that he
had property down there.

09:53.822 --> 09:55.623
He was friendly with the oil companies,

09:55.624 --> 09:57.758
even held meetings with
some of the local oil barons.

09:57.759 --> 10:00.661
So, Marsh was in bed
with Suarez's opponents?

10:00.662 --> 10:03.097
Not surprising

10:03.098 --> 10:05.299
El Presidente is hostile towards us.

10:05.300 --> 10:09.136
Well, I'm just saying, tread carefully.

10:09.137 --> 10:12.239
Suarez is a lunatic, but Venezuela

10:12.240 --> 10:14.141
is still a major source for petroleum.

10:14.142 --> 10:16.510
I'll do my best to keep you informed.

10:16.511 --> 10:19.846
I'm sure you will.

10:20.414 --> 10:22.383
You know, the manifest

10:22.384 --> 10:25.352
said Marsh was on his way to
Caracas on his last flight.

10:25.353 --> 10:27.054
Maybe you can finish what he started.

10:27.055 --> 10:28.589
What's that?

10:28.590 --> 10:30.124
Actually land.

10:30.125 --> 10:33.827
I really don't appreciate
your sense of humor.

10:33.828 --> 10:37.330
Have a safe trip.

10:40.734 --> 10:43.504
Then we wrap up our Venezuelan
trip with a press conference,

10:43.505 --> 10:44.738
where you will stand

10:44.739 --> 10:47.174
between Secretary McCord
and President Suarez.

10:47.175 --> 10:48.976
In a literal representation

10:48.977 --> 10:51.745
of baseball as a bridge
between our nations.

10:51.746 --> 10:53.380
Or as common ground.

10:53.381 --> 10:54.882
I defer all metaphors to our

10:54.883 --> 10:56.350
illustrious speechwriter.

10:56.351 --> 10:57.985
Oh, and don't worry about your speech.

10:57.986 --> 10:59.853
Matt can talk to you on the plane

10:59.854 --> 11:01.421
and draft something that's heartfelt.

11:01.422 --> 11:03.523
Anything you need, we'll be there.

11:03.524 --> 11:05.759
Well, you guys got all
the bases covered, huh?

11:07.028 --> 11:08.662
Is that a baseball reference I hear?

11:08.663 --> 11:09.730
Madam Secretary.

11:09.731 --> 11:11.598
Mr. Azucco, thank you so much

11:11.599 --> 11:13.033
for stepping up to the plate for us.

11:13.034 --> 11:15.402
Oh, I'm happy to be in the lineup.

11:15.403 --> 11:17.537
We can do this all day, can't we?

11:17.538 --> 11:19.439
But you are not just any teammate.

11:19.440 --> 11:21.374
.340 average in the postseason

11:21.375 --> 11:23.543
and 472 career home runs...

11:23.544 --> 11:25.912
- wow!
- So you're a fan, huh?

11:25.913 --> 11:28.448
Actually, I know virtually
nothing about baseball,

11:28.449 --> 11:30.584
but I am smart enough to
be briefed by people who do,

11:30.585 --> 11:32.786
like my assistant Blake.

11:32.787 --> 11:34.154
The irony is I know even less.

11:34.155 --> 11:35.455
Quick study.

11:36.524 --> 11:38.525
Well, I just hope I can deliver.

11:38.526 --> 11:41.428
No American Cabinet member has
made an official state visit

11:41.429 --> 11:43.096
to Venezuela this century,

11:43.097 --> 11:44.731
so you have already hit
it out of the ballpark.

11:44.732 --> 11:47.400
I... okay, I'm out of control.

11:48.602 --> 11:49.936
- Thank you.
- You're very welcome.

11:49.937 --> 11:52.438
Okay,

11:52.439 --> 11:54.607
you are all set, food-wise,

11:54.608 --> 11:55.942
and if you guys want to order a pizza,

11:55.943 --> 11:57.710
- I'm going to leave you...
- I have cash.

11:57.711 --> 11:59.279
I think we're going to survive, Mom.

11:59.280 --> 12:00.913
Well, do I have to say no parties?

12:00.914 --> 12:02.548
Apparently.

12:02.549 --> 12:03.783
No boyfriends.

12:03.784 --> 12:05.451
We're not 12.

12:05.452 --> 12:07.553
Well, you were a shorter
time ago than you think.

12:07.554 --> 12:09.022
That doesn't even make sense.

12:09.023 --> 12:10.223
It will when you have kids.

12:10.224 --> 12:12.525
I doubt our kids will
have a security detail

12:12.526 --> 12:14.527
waiting outside to make
sure we don't throw a kegger.

12:14.528 --> 12:16.696
Well, hey, you never know.

12:16.697 --> 12:17.964
But you make a good point.

12:17.965 --> 12:21.100
Thank you for coming home to do this.

12:21.101 --> 12:22.435
I know I'm not exactly your

12:22.436 --> 12:24.770
favorite person in the world right now.

12:24.771 --> 12:25.705
I'm here for Ali.

12:25.706 --> 12:28.174
Okay, understood. That's good.

12:28.175 --> 12:30.142
Okay, barring any disasters,

12:30.143 --> 12:32.645
Jason will be on his
Killington trip the whole time.

12:32.646 --> 12:34.513
- We're all set. Glasses.
- Okay.

12:34.514 --> 12:36.282
No boyfriends. No parties.

12:36.283 --> 12:38.077
- Roger that. - Got it?
- I just said that.

12:38.078 --> 12:38.996
- Bye.
- Okay, you ready?

12:38.997 --> 12:39.967
- Yes, I am.
- Let's go.

12:39.968 --> 12:41.287
- Okay.
- Bye, girls.

12:41.288 --> 12:43.805
Bye, darling.

12:43.806 --> 12:45.508
- Hey, your good, everybody.
- Bedtime is 9:00 p.m.

12:45.509 --> 12:46.641
Yes. Where are my glasses?

12:46.642 --> 12:48.212
On your face. On your face.

12:48.213 --> 12:49.065
All right.

12:49.144 --> 12:51.778
Does the secretary suspect anything?

12:51.779 --> 12:53.814
No.

12:53.815 --> 12:55.883
I-I mean, I don't think so.

12:55.884 --> 12:57.818
I'm still in the loop.

12:57.819 --> 12:59.419
Tell me about it.

12:59.420 --> 13:01.889
The loop.

13:01.890 --> 13:03.490
I don't know.

13:03.491 --> 13:06.759
We're conducting the diplomatic
business of the nation.

13:10.497 --> 13:13.700
There was one thing a couple weeks ago.

13:13.701 --> 13:16.336
She, um, she brought in
the Israeli ambassador

13:16.337 --> 13:18.071
and his delegation on short notice.

13:18.072 --> 13:19.539
Why?

13:19.540 --> 13:20.313
No idea.

13:20.314 --> 13:22.008
But she cleared her schedule to do it.

13:22.009 --> 13:23.942
She must have had a reason.

13:24.544 --> 13:26.813
I saw her talk to Ambassador Dori.

13:26.814 --> 13:28.548
About what?

13:30.585 --> 13:33.453
Well, she was being
pretty private about it.

13:33.454 --> 13:37.857
But I think I heard her say, âDubai.â

13:37.858 --> 13:40.293
Dubai?

13:40.294 --> 13:42.429
Yeah.

13:42.430 --> 13:44.798
What about it?

13:44.799 --> 13:48.867
That's... that's all I heard.

13:53.640 --> 13:55.675
You can pull over here.

13:55.676 --> 13:58.044
Have a pleasant trip.

13:58.045 --> 14:00.647
Keep your ears open down there.

14:00.648 --> 14:03.015
Right.

Secretary McCord.

14:32.067 --> 14:34.369
Welcome to our humble paradise.

14:34.370 --> 14:36.104
President Suarez.

14:36.105 --> 14:38.740
Dr. McCord. Nice to meet you.

14:38.741 --> 14:40.174
My beautiful wife, Sylvia.

14:40.175 --> 14:41.605
- Nice to meet you, Sylvia.
- You, too.

14:41.606 --> 14:43.243
- Sylvia.
- Hello.

14:43.244 --> 14:45.724
Thank you, President Suarez, for having us.

14:45.725 --> 14:47.215
Mrs. El Presidente

14:47.216 --> 14:49.484
is mucho mucho.

14:49.485 --> 14:51.666
Miss Universe 2002.

14:51.667 --> 14:52.475
Breathe, Matt.

14:52.476 --> 14:54.540
Venezuela has the most
Miss Universe winners

14:54.541 --> 14:56.741
besides the United States.

14:56.742 --> 14:59.376
Gotta love our homegrown talent.

15:00.378 --> 15:02.418
Now, let us not pretend

15:02.419 --> 15:05.221
about why you're here, Madam Secretary.

15:05.222 --> 15:06.922
Spreading democracy?

15:06.923 --> 15:08.391
Free elections?

15:08.392 --> 15:11.060
Uh... Manny?

15:11.061 --> 15:13.061
You're up.

15:20.903 --> 15:22.905
We're in.

15:22.906 --> 15:25.541
Game on.

15:43.058 --> 15:46.795
Okay, I was finally able to
pry Suarez away from Manny,

15:46.796 --> 15:48.497
and I'm not saying mission accomplished,

15:48.498 --> 15:51.333
but El Presidente just agreed
to look over the joint statement.

15:51.334 --> 15:53.102
Big Sugar knocks in a run.

15:53.103 --> 15:55.737
Yeah, except do you see
what I'm seeing over here?

15:57.874 --> 15:59.408
Is she touching his butt?

15:59.409 --> 16:01.243
Okay...

16:01.244 --> 16:02.611
ballplayers do do that.

16:02.612 --> 16:03.912
Not like that.

16:03.913 --> 16:05.147
Okay, she cannot run those bases.

16:05.148 --> 16:06.315
What are you gonna do about it?

16:06.316 --> 16:07.549
Run interference.

16:07.550 --> 16:09.117
First of all, you can't
mix sports metaphors.

16:09.118 --> 16:10.586
Second of all,

16:10.587 --> 16:11.953
what kind of interference?

16:11.954 --> 16:14.523
Ew. Why did you just go there?

16:14.524 --> 16:15.891
What am I supposed to think?

16:15.892 --> 16:17.825
You didn't sign those papers.

16:19.761 --> 16:21.430
Hi, guys.

16:21.431 --> 16:22.731
How you doing?

16:22.732 --> 16:24.999
Is everything good?

16:28.770 --> 16:30.539
Our heroine.

16:30.540 --> 16:33.108
International incident averted.

16:33.109 --> 16:36.510
Yeah, if only she didn't
seem to enjoy it so much.

16:40.081 --> 16:42.550
El Presidente's people say

16:42.551 --> 16:46.388
he's approved the âopen to
considering electionsâ language.

16:46.389 --> 16:48.089
Well, who'd-a thunk?

16:48.090 --> 16:50.859
Real progress on our fake trip.

16:50.860 --> 16:53.294
We've called the press
conference for tomorrow noon.

16:53.295 --> 16:54.829
And our other business?

16:54.830 --> 16:58.867
Well, I should have a few
hours free in the morning.

16:58.868 --> 17:00.767
Can I see that passport?

17:07.075 --> 17:09.377
Marsh ever tell you where he had this made?

17:09.377 --> 17:10.877
No. But no one questioned it

17:10.878 --> 17:13.114
when I was made a signator to the account.

17:13.115 --> 17:14.281
Well, they wouldn't.

17:14.282 --> 17:16.584
Fine piece of tradecraft.

17:16.585 --> 17:19.654
Definitely get you through
the first layer of security.

17:19.655 --> 17:21.589
After that, they'll scan biometrics.

17:21.589 --> 17:24.058
Ma'am, I am not accustomed
to doing this kind of thing.

17:24.059 --> 17:25.460
I know, but you'll be fine, Nadine.

17:25.461 --> 17:27.627
Yeah, thanks.

17:27.628 --> 17:30.898
I'll give you the advice
my first handler gave me.

17:30.899 --> 17:32.700
Get in, get out,

17:32.701 --> 17:35.269
say as little as possible.

17:35.270 --> 17:36.804
Eloquent.

17:38.106 --> 17:41.641
Yeah, I wasn't very impressed either.

17:42.276 --> 17:44.111
Good night, ma'am.

17:44.112 --> 17:46.580
Good night.

17:52.553 --> 17:54.188
Well played, Dr. McCord.

17:54.189 --> 17:55.890
You're not the only one
in this marriage capable

17:55.891 --> 17:57.258
of a charm offensive.

17:57.259 --> 17:58.959
- Oh.
- The steak is cold.

17:58.960 --> 18:00.895
It's perfect.

18:00.896 --> 18:02.096
How's Nadine?

18:02.097 --> 18:03.864
She's okay.

18:03.865 --> 18:06.200
She wants to know the truth
about Marsh as much as I do.

18:06.201 --> 18:07.501
What about you?

18:07.502 --> 18:08.869
I'm hungry.

18:08.870 --> 18:11.005
But you know what I
want to do before we eat?

18:11.006 --> 18:12.273
I know what I want to do.

18:12.274 --> 18:13.641
Call the kids.

18:13.642 --> 18:15.576
That's exactly what I was thinking.

18:20.448 --> 18:21.744
- We got to call the kids.
- Call the kids.

18:21.745 --> 18:23.282
Oh, my God.

18:25.953 --> 18:28.321
Here we go.

18:28.956 --> 18:30.124
Mom, everything is fine.

18:30.125 --> 18:31.492
Stevie just had to go out.

18:31.493 --> 18:33.060
What do you mean she went out?

18:33.061 --> 18:35.329
This-this late? What?

18:35.330 --> 18:37.064
- We were out of milk.
- Milk?

18:37.065 --> 18:40.134
Since when does anybody other
than Jason care about milk?

18:40.135 --> 18:42.135
Oh, wait, she's here.

18:42.136 --> 18:44.137
- Do you want to talk to her?
- Yeah, I want to...

18:44.138 --> 18:45.305
I love you, Ali.

18:46.808 --> 18:49.076
- Hi, Mom.
- Stevie,

18:49.077 --> 18:51.678
what do you mean you were out getting milk?

18:51.679 --> 18:54.680
Soy milk. I can't have the real stuff.

18:55.315 --> 18:56.750
Since when?

18:56.751 --> 18:59.419
I, uh, decided not to drink dairy anymore.

18:59.420 --> 19:01.054
Um, is it really that
big of a deal, though?

19:01.055 --> 19:03.156
I mean, I was only gone for ten minutes.

19:03.157 --> 19:04.424
No, but I...

19:04.425 --> 19:06.426
No-no more going out.

19:06.427 --> 19:08.962
The whole point of having you there was...

19:08.963 --> 19:10.330
having you there.

19:10.331 --> 19:11.732
Okay, I promise.

19:11.733 --> 19:13.366
Talk to you tomorrow.

19:13.367 --> 19:15.667
Okay, wait, Stevie...

19:16.536 --> 19:20.106
Okay, something is
definitely going on there.

19:20.107 --> 19:21.841
Mm, yeah,

19:21.842 --> 19:23.643
but we have a whole team of
agents to look out for them.

19:23.644 --> 19:25.445
- What could they possibly be up to?
- Right.

19:25.446 --> 19:26.913
But I mean, you think that maybe they could

19:26.914 --> 19:29.015
slip a kegger past the detail?

19:29.016 --> 19:30.984
Well, y... no.

19:30.985 --> 19:32.319
No. Come on.

19:32.320 --> 19:34.754
One conspiracy at a time, okay?

19:34.755 --> 19:37.435
Okay.

19:37.857 --> 19:39.993
So, did the security guys suspect anything?

19:39.994 --> 19:41.628
Who do you think you're dealing with here?

19:41.629 --> 19:44.030
Even that tall guy,
always asking questions?

19:44.031 --> 19:45.131
Relax.

19:45.132 --> 19:46.733
I signed James in, I put my arm around him.

19:46.734 --> 19:48.101
Tall guy didn't blink.

19:48.102 --> 19:49.469
Thank you so much.

19:49.470 --> 19:51.204
You should thank Mom.

19:51.205 --> 19:53.965
Why are you so mad at her anyways?

19:56.676 --> 19:58.478
Do you really care?

19:58.479 --> 20:00.011
Nope.

20:06.886 --> 20:08.421
Hey there.

20:08.422 --> 20:10.957
Expecting someone else?

20:10.958 --> 20:13.259
What part of âhey thereâ says that?

20:13.260 --> 20:14.660
Your tone.

20:14.661 --> 20:16.028
Like you were hoping for Big Sugar.

20:16.029 --> 20:17.730
Oh, stop.

20:23.536 --> 20:25.538
Manny, uh, what is it?

20:25.539 --> 20:28.540
What do you want it to be?

20:29.342 --> 20:32.178
Wow. Uh, anything but what I think it is.

20:32.179 --> 20:34.380
And what's that?

20:34.381 --> 20:35.781
Okay.

20:35.782 --> 20:37.149
Done with 20 questions.

20:37.150 --> 20:38.584
You need to go back to your room.

20:38.585 --> 20:40.786
Or maybe you need to let me in.

20:40.787 --> 20:42.188
Hmm?

20:42.189 --> 20:45.558
Has anyone ever said no to
you in your entire adult life?

20:45.559 --> 20:46.759
Not that I recall.

20:46.760 --> 20:47.893
Then listen up.

20:47.894 --> 20:49.895
No.

20:49.896 --> 20:51.664
Playing hard to get, huh?

20:51.665 --> 20:53.732
I'm not playing. Period.

20:53.733 --> 20:55.601
- But we're on vacation.
- I'm working.

20:55.602 --> 20:57.536
You're funny.

20:57.537 --> 21:00.272
Wow, you can't even comprehend
being told the word no, can you?

21:00.273 --> 21:03.307
All right, let me try one other thing.

21:11.116 --> 21:13.485
Pardonnez-moi, guys.

21:13.486 --> 21:15.087
Ali, come here.

21:15.088 --> 21:18.089
Babe, just give me a sec.

21:19.992 --> 21:21.527
So, what do you want to do?

21:21.528 --> 21:22.895
I don't know... his parents think

21:22.896 --> 21:25.264
he's at Eddie Jankowski's
place for the night.

21:25.265 --> 21:26.598
Okay.

21:26.599 --> 21:28.934
So maybe he can stay?

21:28.935 --> 21:32.037
Maybe as in you want him to stay or not?

21:32.038 --> 21:36.675
It's after 1:30, so if I'm going
to drive him home, this is it.

21:36.676 --> 21:39.144
I don't know.

21:39.145 --> 21:41.179
I think he may be the one.

21:41.180 --> 21:44.249
And he has, you know, protection.

21:44.250 --> 21:45.917
Good.

21:45.918 --> 21:48.186
And Mom and Dad will never know?

21:48.187 --> 21:50.055
I signed him in.

21:50.056 --> 21:51.823
Tall security guy thinks he's with me.

21:51.824 --> 21:53.658
- You're in the clear.
- You're the best.

21:53.659 --> 21:55.660
- Thank you.
- Whatever.

21:55.661 --> 21:57.195
See you in the morning.

21:57.196 --> 21:59.463
James, let's go upstairs.

22:00.498 --> 22:02.900
Twist my arm.

22:10.542 --> 22:11.810
Wait.

22:11.811 --> 22:14.479
Wait, wait. James, no.
I'm gonna drive you home.

22:14.480 --> 22:15.981
What? You just said he could stay.

22:15.982 --> 22:18.515
Well, now I'm saying that he can't.

22:19.384 --> 22:20.785
Come on.

22:20.786 --> 22:22.352
Now.

22:44.375 --> 22:46.176
Right thumbprint.

23:24.181 --> 23:26.417
Five minutes, ladies and gentlemen.

23:26.418 --> 23:29.687
Comenzamos en cinco
minutos, seńoras y seńores.

23:29.688 --> 23:32.690
We agreed on new guidelines for U.S.
oil companies sharing drilling rights,

23:32.691 --> 23:35.092
and he's not saying one way
or another on free elections,

23:35.093 --> 23:38.128
- which means he's not ruling them out.
- Well, I found some

23:38.129 --> 23:40.731
great baseball allusions for
Madam Secretary's introduction.

23:40.732 --> 23:42.399
I mean, there's this
whole extended metaphor

23:42.400 --> 23:44.268
about fielding... which I see she's cut,

23:44.269 --> 23:45.603
probably for time.

23:45.604 --> 23:47.270
Yeah, I'm sure that was it.

23:54.878 --> 23:57.881
The week before Secretary Marsh's death

23:57.882 --> 24:01.752
the account contained
40 million U.S. dollars.

24:01.753 --> 24:04.621
Any names of depositors?

24:04.622 --> 24:07.424
Just numbers. But the money is gone.

24:07.425 --> 24:10.093
The account has been emptied out.

24:10.094 --> 24:11.995
By Marsh?

24:11.996 --> 24:13.230
No.

24:13.231 --> 24:18.000
The money was withdrawn
the day after he died.

24:26.918 --> 24:29.384
Do the bank records show
who withdrew the money?

24:29.385 --> 24:31.385
It's a name I didn't recognize.

24:31.386 --> 24:35.189
She signed in as the
corporation's recording secretary.

24:35.190 --> 24:37.191
Marie Porter.

24:37.192 --> 24:40.127
Do you know who that is?

24:40.128 --> 24:41.629
No.

24:41.630 --> 24:44.431
But I know it's a pseudonym.

24:45.199 --> 24:47.767
Like Carlotta Taniston.

24:48.369 --> 24:49.904
Well,

24:49.905 --> 24:52.807
you'll need to find out who she is.

24:52.808 --> 24:56.643
And what the hell Vincent Marsh was doing.

24:57.878 --> 25:00.113
Thank you, Nadine.

25:01.515 --> 25:04.250
I swear I'm glad he's dead.

25:06.187 --> 25:07.922
Madam Secretary,

25:07.923 --> 25:09.456
we're ready to start.

25:16.096 --> 25:17.331
Hi.

25:17.332 --> 25:18.632
Hi.

25:18.633 --> 25:20.100
We need to talk.

25:20.101 --> 25:21.435
Do we?

25:21.436 --> 25:24.471
I'm sorry for last night.

25:24.472 --> 25:25.873
Water under the bridge.

25:25.874 --> 25:29.009
Whoa... so you're not gonna tell anyone?

25:29.010 --> 25:30.811
Of course not.

25:30.812 --> 25:33.447
Well, listen.

25:33.448 --> 25:36.283
It's really important
that I can count on you.

25:36.284 --> 25:37.918
Mm-hmm.

25:37.919 --> 25:40.988
You must worry a lot about
protecting your image.

25:40.989 --> 25:43.462
Maybe you should worry a little more

25:43.463 --> 25:44.892
about the people that look up to you.

25:44.893 --> 25:47.394
What does that mean?

25:47.395 --> 25:50.130
You are on a diplomatic mission,

25:50.131 --> 25:52.666
representing a country
where you have the right

25:52.667 --> 25:55.427
to live the way you want to.

25:56.403 --> 25:58.537
Think hypocrisy.

26:00.474 --> 26:02.008
James isn't responding to my texts.

26:02.009 --> 26:03.410
Because you didn't sleep with him?

26:03.411 --> 26:05.378
- Because you made him go home.
- Wow,

26:05.379 --> 26:07.180
sounds like you picked
a real winner there, Al.

26:07.181 --> 26:09.983
- Don't even. James is awesome.
- Maybe you should

26:09.984 --> 26:11.585
Snapchat him a shot of your boobs.

26:11.586 --> 26:14.139
- That might get a response.
- You've ruined everything.

26:14.140 --> 26:15.155
I know.

26:15.156 --> 26:17.057
I'm sure that you losing it to James

26:17.058 --> 26:19.459
would have been just
like you always dreamed.

26:19.460 --> 26:21.027
That's none of your business.

26:21.028 --> 26:22.529
Actually, it is. I was only gonna

26:22.530 --> 26:24.297
let him stay to get back at Mom.

26:24.298 --> 26:25.332
So why didn't you?

26:25.333 --> 26:27.467
Because I didn't want to do that to you.

26:27.468 --> 26:30.010
I liked it so much better without you here.

26:30.011 --> 26:30.737
Don't worry,

26:30.738 --> 26:33.440
as soon as Mom and Dad
are back, I'm so out.

26:33.441 --> 26:35.608
Today marks the beginning
of a new relationship

26:35.609 --> 26:37.143
between our two countries.

26:37.144 --> 26:39.546
Finding a way to work
through our differences,

26:39.547 --> 26:41.915
and to celebrate our common ground.

26:41.916 --> 26:44.584
As a shining example,

26:44.585 --> 26:46.452
I would like to introduce another guest

26:46.453 --> 26:48.087
of President Suarez,

26:48.088 --> 26:50.857
someone I know you all want to hear from,

26:50.858 --> 26:53.860
who'd like to express his
gratitude in his own words.

26:53.861 --> 26:56.796
Manny Azucco.

26:56.797 --> 27:00.733
Thank you, Madam Secretary.

27:04.438 --> 27:07.306
My name is Emmanuel Azucco.

27:07.307 --> 27:10.009
I'm the proud son of a Venezuelan mother,

27:10.010 --> 27:14.080
and a proud citizen of the United States.

27:14.081 --> 27:15.414
I'm here...

27:15.415 --> 27:18.217
as a representative of my
country, the United States,

27:18.218 --> 27:20.386
and the freedoms it stands for.

27:20.387 --> 27:22.255
Freedom of speech,

27:22.256 --> 27:24.090
of assembly,

27:24.091 --> 27:25.858
freedom to vote...

27:25.859 --> 27:27.860
to choose.

27:27.861 --> 27:30.096
To choose to be who you are

27:30.097 --> 27:31.897
and speak your truth.

27:31.898 --> 27:35.967
So I cannot stand here...

27:36.802 --> 27:38.237
...and not tell the truth.

27:38.238 --> 27:40.873
And that is that I...

27:40.874 --> 27:42.808
Manny Azucco...

27:42.809 --> 27:44.410
am gay.

27:46.813 --> 27:48.380
I am gay,

27:48.381 --> 27:50.983
Venezuelan-American,

27:50.984 --> 27:52.585
and proud.

28:15.107 --> 28:16.147
How bad is it?

28:16.148 --> 28:17.963
Suarez is canceling the rest of the visit,

28:17.964 --> 28:19.637
disavowing everything we've agreed upon.

28:19.638 --> 28:21.264
We have an hour before
he puts us on a plane.

28:21.265 --> 28:23.048
Wait, all because Manny
stole the spotlight?

28:23.049 --> 28:24.650
He feels the insult was deliberate.

28:24.651 --> 28:26.084
We weren't aware of this
before, but apparently,

28:26.085 --> 28:28.987
there were rumors in the last election.

28:28.988 --> 28:30.811
Stories that Suarez had a little fun

28:30.812 --> 28:32.558
with other cadets when he
was back in the barracks.

28:32.559 --> 28:34.244
What does that have to do
with anything? I don't...

28:34.245 --> 28:34.991
Nothing confirmed,

28:34.992 --> 28:36.595
but they were attacks on his machismo.

28:36.596 --> 28:39.031
So now we get to deal
with a brutal dictator

28:39.032 --> 28:41.433
- who's always touchy.
- How did this happen?

28:41.434 --> 28:43.468
Did no one see this coming?

28:43.469 --> 28:47.005
Manny may have opened up
to me about his sexuality,

28:47.006 --> 28:50.075
and I may have said
something about hypocrisy.

28:50.076 --> 28:51.276
Madam Secretary...

28:51.277 --> 28:53.879
the president would like to meet with you

28:53.880 --> 28:56.246
and your chief of staff.

28:57.549 --> 28:59.651
Maybe he's reconsidering.

28:59.652 --> 29:01.785
Yep. Yep.

29:04.189 --> 29:07.459
President Suarez, I can honestly tell you

29:07.460 --> 29:10.695
- there was no intention on anyone's...
- No more talking.

29:10.696 --> 29:12.831
It is I, Suarez, who will
make the terms to you,

29:12.832 --> 29:13.865
the United States.

29:13.866 --> 29:15.367
I want a full public apology,

29:15.368 --> 29:17.235
also an apology from Seńor Azucco,

29:17.236 --> 29:18.403
and a retraction.

29:18.404 --> 29:22.038
Mr. Azucco can hardly take back being gay.

29:22.039 --> 29:23.233
You want to humiliate me

29:23.234 --> 29:24.434
and the people of Venezuela,

29:24.435 --> 29:26.595
then I will humiliate you... Colonel?

29:26.870 --> 29:28.305
This is Colonel Lionel Fuentes

29:28.306 --> 29:30.407
of the Policía National.

29:30.408 --> 29:31.675
Show them.

29:31.676 --> 29:33.844
This was delivered by the
Financial Intelligence Unit,

29:33.845 --> 29:35.512
who brought it to our
president's attention.

29:35.513 --> 29:37.049
The account you accessed,
Seńorita Tolliver,

29:37.050 --> 29:38.381
is one of a number of accounts

29:38.382 --> 29:39.683
being monitored by the unit

29:39.684 --> 29:41.651
on suspicion of being
used to conceal profits

29:41.652 --> 29:44.087
from drug dealing, funds for illegal arms,

29:44.088 --> 29:45.789
and money laundering of all kinds.

29:45.790 --> 29:47.590
What will the world say, Madam,

29:47.591 --> 29:49.592
when they see that your
chief of staff got caught,

29:49.593 --> 29:50.593
is perhaps arrested,

29:50.594 --> 29:52.996
for doing business with a dirty bank?

29:52.997 --> 29:55.265
I will set the terms... no talk

29:55.266 --> 29:57.333
of free elections; you
will make a public statement

29:57.334 --> 30:00.270
supporting my government;
and that you, Madam Secretary,

30:00.271 --> 30:03.705
would be happy if Suarez
chooses to be President for Life.

30:06.676 --> 30:09.078
You need to time to prepare your statement?

30:09.079 --> 30:12.015
Very well. I will give you that time.

30:12.016 --> 30:15.250
We should go, ma'am.

30:20.757 --> 30:21.891
Well?

30:21.892 --> 30:24.260
At least El Presidente was very clear.

30:24.261 --> 30:27.563
We've got to figure out
a way to be just as clear.

30:27.564 --> 30:28.965
Jay.

30:28.966 --> 30:31.000
- Ma'am?
- No more incentives.

30:31.001 --> 30:33.636
We got to beat him at his own game.

30:33.637 --> 30:36.372
What do we have on currency conversion?

30:36.373 --> 30:37.206
Currency conversion?

30:37.207 --> 30:39.108
It's risky...

30:39.109 --> 30:40.977
but it's a good idea.

30:40.978 --> 30:41.911
All right.

30:41.912 --> 30:44.479
Get Treasury on the phone.

30:46.249 --> 30:48.917
We're in this together.

31:07.058 --> 31:09.759
Thank you for meeting
like this, Ambassador Dori.

31:09.760 --> 31:12.262
Under such informal circumstances,

31:12.263 --> 31:13.796
it's like I'm back

31:13.797 --> 31:16.166
being a regular civilian.

31:17.234 --> 31:20.036
You were never a regular at anything, Lior.

31:20.037 --> 31:22.372
You have a question?

31:22.373 --> 31:26.242
You and our Secretary of
State had a private discussion

31:26.243 --> 31:27.610
couple weeks ago.

31:27.611 --> 31:30.246
I'm wondering if you can
fill me in on the details.

31:30.247 --> 31:33.283
It's your State Department...
why won't you ask her yourself?

31:33.284 --> 31:36.552
Or aren't the White House and
Foggy Bottom on speaking terms?

31:36.553 --> 31:39.622
Perhaps I wasn't clear.

31:39.623 --> 31:41.290
This is me...

31:41.291 --> 31:43.326
asking on behalf of the president

31:43.327 --> 31:45.962
what you talked about
with Elizabeth McCord.

31:45.963 --> 31:47.230
Forgive me,

31:47.231 --> 31:48.564
but I'm a foreign national.

31:48.565 --> 31:51.166
I don't have to answer...
he's not my president.

31:54.036 --> 31:57.940
Was it about an incident that
took place in the Persian Gulf

31:57.941 --> 32:00.243
11 years ago?

32:00.244 --> 32:02.578
When you were head of Mossad,

32:02.579 --> 32:07.350
and what looked like an accident
killed an enemy of Israel?

32:07.351 --> 32:08.818
You seem to know all about it.

32:08.819 --> 32:10.485
What more can I tell you?

32:12.021 --> 32:14.956
Sorry I couldn't be more helpful.

32:18.828 --> 32:20.830
You may have helped...

32:20.831 --> 32:23.464
just enough.

32:28.571 --> 32:30.706
President Suarez,

32:30.707 --> 32:34.176
you and I differ on many
fundamental issues, but...

32:34.177 --> 32:37.246
I think on this one we can agree...

32:37.247 --> 32:38.714
you are a clever man.

32:38.715 --> 32:40.749
You have uncovered the fact that

32:40.750 --> 32:44.219
we are not here solely
on a diplomatic mission.

32:44.220 --> 32:45.821
I came here to indict you.

32:45.822 --> 32:48.757
You? Indict me?

32:48.758 --> 32:50.592
Even after your chief of staff got caught

32:50.593 --> 32:53.095
trying to withdraw funds
from a dirty account?

32:53.096 --> 32:55.163
She wasn't trying to withdraw money.

32:55.164 --> 32:57.533
She was gathering information on my behalf

32:57.534 --> 32:59.434
for a broader investigation

32:59.435 --> 33:02.337
headed by the U.S. Department of Justice.

33:02.338 --> 33:04.439
What kind of investigation?

33:04.440 --> 33:06.875
Into the lax security procedures

33:06.876 --> 33:09.745
at certain Venezuelan
banks under your regime.

33:09.746 --> 33:11.747
Some might argue that

33:11.748 --> 33:14.850
your own security forces had
been monitoring such banks,

33:14.851 --> 33:17.052
not in the interest of enforcement,

33:17.053 --> 33:19.454
but for blackmail.

33:19.455 --> 33:22.524
The U.S. Treasury Department
has expressed its concern,

33:22.525 --> 33:23.959
so much so that it's

33:23.960 --> 33:26.962
considering a proposal to
ban all future transactions

33:26.963 --> 33:29.764
in U.S. dollars carried
out by Venezuelan banks.

33:29.765 --> 33:32.701
A measure they'll likely take,
if you declare yourself dictator

33:32.702 --> 33:35.637
and deny free elections...
an action which would

33:35.638 --> 33:39.474
cripple your national economy
and erase whatever recovery

33:39.475 --> 33:41.476
it's made under your presidency.

33:41.477 --> 33:44.746
I know that you inherited
this banking situation.

33:44.747 --> 33:46.781
I'm willing to advocate

33:46.782 --> 33:49.451
on your behalf with the Justice Department,

33:49.452 --> 33:52.487
assure them that you
find these circumstances

33:52.488 --> 33:55.455
as reprehensible as we do.

33:58.393 --> 34:00.662
Let us say I come around
to your way of thinking.

34:00.663 --> 34:02.497
There's still the matter of damage control

34:02.498 --> 34:04.132
after today's press conference.

34:04.133 --> 34:06.568
Yes, we've thought of that, too.

34:06.569 --> 34:08.835
We've been tracking Twitter
and other social media.

34:08.837 --> 34:11.105
Manny's blowing up,
especially here in Venezuela.

34:11.106 --> 34:13.775
An overwhelming majority
of your country's population

34:13.775 --> 34:17.277
still view Manny Azucco as
a hero and national treasure.

34:17.279 --> 34:19.679
And it turns out that Mr. Azucco

34:19.681 --> 34:22.317
is interested in returning to baseball.

34:22.318 --> 34:25.152
Only this time, he wants
to play on a bigger stage.

34:25.154 --> 34:28.556
He wants to play in a true World Series.

34:28.556 --> 34:31.958
The World Baseball
Classic this coming March,

34:31.960 --> 34:35.062
as a member of your national team.

34:35.063 --> 34:38.899
Even going into retirement,
his stats were pretty good.

34:38.900 --> 34:40.635
He'd wipe the diamond
with your competition.

34:40.636 --> 34:43.437
The highest Venezuela
ever placed was third,

34:43.438 --> 34:45.606
back in 2009.

34:45.607 --> 34:47.742
This could put your team
back on top and garner

34:47.743 --> 34:51.844
world attention, as well as national pride.

35:01.655 --> 35:03.324
Colonel Fuentes...

35:03.325 --> 35:05.559
I wonder if I might ask a favor,

35:05.560 --> 35:09.530
as one enemy of corruption to another.

35:09.531 --> 35:12.600
I'm listening.

35:12.601 --> 35:15.636
I'm interested in any information you have

35:15.637 --> 35:18.504
on the other signatories on that account.

35:21.175 --> 35:24.011
I will deliver the
results to you personally.

35:24.012 --> 35:26.746
I really appreciate it. Thank you.

35:28.816 --> 35:30.117
At 12:15

35:30.118 --> 35:33.120
this afternoon, Ambassador
Dori and Russell Jackson

35:33.121 --> 35:35.656
each went off their official
schedules for half an hour.

35:35.657 --> 35:37.224
Given what you fed Jackson...

35:37.225 --> 35:38.825
That's no coincidence.

35:38.826 --> 35:41.228
It doesn't mean Jackson was
involved in killing Marsh.

35:41.229 --> 35:43.662
Well, it looks really bad.

35:44.565 --> 35:46.567
So tell me what I'm looking at.

35:46.568 --> 35:48.535
That's a surveillance photo obtained

35:48.536 --> 35:51.371
from the Venezuelan National Police.

35:51.372 --> 35:55.308
That's the last person to make
a withdrawal on Marsh's account.

35:55.309 --> 35:57.844
Signed herself in as...

35:57.845 --> 35:59.880
Marie Porter.

35:59.881 --> 36:01.014
Took out $40 million

36:01.015 --> 36:04.117
the day after Marsh's plane crashed.

36:04.118 --> 36:06.486
You think there's enough for a facial I.D.?

36:06.487 --> 36:08.288
Well, let's see what comes up.

36:08.289 --> 36:09.589
I'll let you know.

36:09.590 --> 36:11.957
Thanks.

36:19.699 --> 36:21.501
You got a minute?

36:23.371 --> 36:24.671
You scared me.

36:24.672 --> 36:27.007
I thought we might have a talk.

36:27.008 --> 36:30.677
You want to know about
what went on in Venezuela?

36:30.678 --> 36:32.812
Yes.

36:32.813 --> 36:35.515
And about the secret investigation

36:35.516 --> 36:36.983
you've been conducting

36:36.984 --> 36:40.018
into Vincent Marsh's death.

36:51.844 --> 36:53.413
I thought I'd seen it all,

36:53.414 --> 36:56.616
just how far it was
possible for you to go...

36:56.617 --> 36:58.351
the arrogance!

36:58.352 --> 37:00.253
Naive behavior! The contempt!

37:00.254 --> 37:03.456
- I don't feel contempt, Russell.
- Then what do you call it?

37:03.457 --> 37:05.325
Did you think I wouldn't
see, wouldn't know?

37:05.326 --> 37:07.160
Nothing gets by me!

37:07.161 --> 37:09.762
Do you understand that?

37:09.763 --> 37:11.231
Yeah.

37:11.232 --> 37:13.867
You thought I wouldn't notice
you questioning the NTSB report?

37:13.868 --> 37:15.702
That says conclusively

37:15.703 --> 37:19.505
Secretary Vincent Marsh
died in an accident.

37:19.506 --> 37:23.409
You didn't think I-I'd
find out you talked to Dori?

37:23.410 --> 37:24.610
About an identical accident,

37:24.611 --> 37:26.446
same plane,

37:26.447 --> 37:28.681
in the Middle East... in the Persian Gulf?

37:28.682 --> 37:30.550
Except that some people
think it wasn't an accident,

37:30.551 --> 37:33.486
that it was staged, most
likely by the Israelis,

37:33.487 --> 37:35.555
to murder someone on their enemies list.

37:35.556 --> 37:38.191
What am I supposed to think about that?

37:38.192 --> 37:41.393
That I don't believe that
Marsh's death was an accident.

37:42.728 --> 37:44.230
You think it was murder.

37:44.231 --> 37:45.998
It was.

37:45.999 --> 37:48.767
But you somehow fail to
share your suspicions.

37:50.903 --> 37:52.171
Not suspicions.

37:52.172 --> 37:54.440
Well, you don't share it
with the people you work with.

37:54.441 --> 37:56.676
With the people supposedly on your team...

37:56.677 --> 38:00.011
myself and the president
of the United States.

38:01.614 --> 38:04.817
So what am I supposed to think? Hmm?

38:04.818 --> 38:07.153
What possible reason could there be...

38:07.154 --> 38:10.321
except you think I had him killed.

38:12.892 --> 38:16.061
Thought you might have
knowledge of it, yes.

38:16.062 --> 38:19.231
You seriously think that I...

38:19.232 --> 38:21.500
and the president... are assassins?

38:21.501 --> 38:24.169
No.

38:24.170 --> 38:25.671
Not anymore.

38:25.672 --> 38:28.140
Wow.

38:28.141 --> 38:29.775
When'd you change your mind?

38:29.776 --> 38:31.610
Just now.

38:31.611 --> 38:34.346
You didn't just find out

38:34.347 --> 38:36.515
about my conversation with Dori.

38:36.516 --> 38:38.517
I led you to it.

38:38.518 --> 38:40.786
I fed you that information

38:40.787 --> 38:43.055
and you went for it.

38:43.056 --> 38:44.823
Now you're showing me your hand

38:44.824 --> 38:47.192
and that tells me everything.

38:47.193 --> 38:49.728
A guy like you, Russell?

38:49.729 --> 38:52.364
With your resources? You
could've covered this up,

38:52.365 --> 38:54.933
throw me off the scent,

38:54.934 --> 38:58.737
probably create false trails of evidence...

38:58.738 --> 39:03.974
everything but what you're doing right now.

39:16.888 --> 39:19.623
Bravo.

39:20.559 --> 39:24.663
I didn't want to be right
about you and the president.

39:24.664 --> 39:27.065
Can I assume he's not involved?

39:27.066 --> 39:28.932
Of course you can.

39:29.567 --> 39:32.327
My God, all this time...

39:34.706 --> 39:36.941
How could you just...

39:36.942 --> 39:39.076
go about your business?

39:43.615 --> 39:45.949
That's what I was trained for.

40:01.866 --> 40:03.767
Tell me everything.

40:05.136 --> 40:06.970
That could take awhile.

40:17.181 --> 40:18.950
I've got all night.

40:29.695 --> 40:32.296
Oh, it is good to have you back.

40:32.297 --> 40:35.532
I'm not back... I just
did you a favor, remember?

40:37.034 --> 40:38.803
So did you start the discussion yet?

40:38.804 --> 40:40.972
- I was waiting for you.
- Wait...

40:40.973 --> 40:42.907
there's a discussion? Really?

40:42.908 --> 40:45.176
You're gonna punish me for helping you out?

40:45.177 --> 40:47.878
It's not punishment. We
just have some questions.

40:47.879 --> 40:49.080
Okay, so, an interrogation, then?

40:49.081 --> 40:51.515
Look, I checked with
security when I came in.

40:51.516 --> 40:53.117
Apparently you signed in a visitor

40:53.118 --> 40:55.085
around 10:00 p.m. the other night.

40:55.086 --> 40:57.054
Someone named James Montgomery?

40:57.055 --> 40:59.523
And he didn't check out until 1:45 a.m.?

40:59.524 --> 41:01.325
Yeah. So?

41:01.326 --> 41:02.760
Stevie...

41:02.761 --> 41:05.196
a guy we don't know,
with Alison in the house?

41:05.197 --> 41:07.331
Oh, come on, he's a guy that I know.

41:07.332 --> 41:10.834
From the restaurant. He
just wanted to drop by.

41:10.835 --> 41:12.736
So late?

41:12.737 --> 41:14.571
It's not late for people my age.

41:14.572 --> 41:17.374
He just wanted to come
by, hang out and talk,

41:17.375 --> 41:19.777
which is all we did.

41:19.778 --> 41:22.312
Is it really that big of a problem?

41:22.313 --> 41:24.114
I'm sorry that I lied,

41:24.115 --> 41:26.716
okay? I just didn't want to worry you.

41:27.885 --> 41:29.453
Going forward...

41:29.454 --> 41:32.790
I would rather that you
worry us than lie to us.

41:32.791 --> 41:36.659
Okay. Lesson learned. I'm sorry.

41:37.127 --> 41:38.695
So you're not really

41:38.696 --> 41:41.365
off of real milk?

41:41.366 --> 41:42.499
No.

41:42.500 --> 41:46.103
Good.

41:46.104 --> 41:47.571
I'm making pancakes.

41:47.572 --> 41:49.306
Okay.

41:49.307 --> 41:52.576
Thank you for staying

41:52.577 --> 41:54.443
and doing that.

41:58.181 --> 42:00.582
No problem.

42:07.891 --> 42:09.392
Yeah,

42:09.393 --> 42:12.662
Isabelle, talk to me.

42:12.663 --> 42:14.698
I got an I.D. on Marie Porter.

42:14.699 --> 42:17.699
You're not gonna like who she works for.

42:19.235 --> 42:21.838
The last person to take
money out of the account

42:21.839 --> 42:24.774
in Caracas was an Iranian national.

42:24.775 --> 42:26.209
She signed in as Marie Porter,

42:26.210 --> 42:29.479
but her real name is Samila Mahdavi.

42:29.480 --> 42:32.482
She's a known affiliate of VEVAK.

42:32.483 --> 42:35.318
The Iranian Foreign Intelligence Ministry.

42:35.319 --> 42:37.320
So the lead goes overseas.

42:37.321 --> 42:39.589
And straight to the government of Iran.

42:39.590 --> 42:42.292
And there go the peace talks.

42:43.661 --> 42:46.429
It's time for you to hand this off, Bess.

42:46.430 --> 42:48.361
To the people who really
should be handling it...

42:48.362 --> 42:49.399
Munsey.

42:49.400 --> 42:50.934
The CIA.

42:50.935 --> 42:52.935
And the president?

42:52.936 --> 42:54.804
You already stopped him from starting
