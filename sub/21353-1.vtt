01:15.200 --> 01:17.828
(indistinct radio chatter)

01:32.175 --> 01:33.768
<i>(Indi) My father always said</i>

01:33.844 --> 01:37.189
<i>that you could never trust a person
that needed something from you.</i>

01:37.431 --> 01:38.523
(Grunts)

01:40.851 --> 01:43.855
<i>But he also said he'd never met anyone</i>

01:43.895 --> 01:47.024
<i>who didn't need something from someone.</i>

01:49.234 --> 01:52.078
<i>Perhaps that's why he
never showed his hurt.</i>

01:53.363 --> 01:56.708
<i>Maybe why he ran away
from all of his problems.</i>

01:59.786 --> 02:04.963
<i>All I know is that somewhere along the path
he lost his purpose.</i>

02:06.710 --> 02:10.055
<i>Which is why I traveled
to the ends of the universe.</i>

02:11.882 --> 02:13.384
<i>To find him again.</i>

02:56.802 --> 02:58.349
(Thunder rumbling)

03:02.641 --> 03:04.143
(Wind howling)

03:06.269 --> 03:09.443
<i>Dad's accident happened
on an earlier combat mission</i>

03:09.523 --> 03:11.116
<i>he led in the Trinity system.</i>

03:11.149 --> 03:12.947
- (Jet whooshing)
- (Explosion)

03:12.984 --> 03:14.611
<i>His mistake was simple,</i>

03:14.653 --> 03:15.779
<i>but resulted in the death</i>

03:15.862 --> 03:18.365
<i>of nearly all of his crew.</i>

03:19.658 --> 03:24.004
<i>On his return to Earth, Dad was accused
of negligence through substance abuse,</i>

03:25.330 --> 03:27.674
<i>but the findings were inconclusive.</i>

03:29.960 --> 03:33.305
<i>Due to his decorated
career as a fighter pilot</i>

03:33.338 --> 03:35.511
<i>- he was pardoned of the case.
- (Engine humming)</i>

03:35.632 --> 03:37.054
<i>But it didn't matter.</i>

03:38.135 --> 03:40.229
<i>He was never the same.</i>

03:40.303 --> 03:42.305
<i>Our family was never the same.</i>

03:46.059 --> 03:48.403
<i>(Kane) You know, you decided
to come out here, remember'?</i>

03:48.478 --> 03:50.151
<i>You wanted to come here.</i>

03:50.188 --> 03:52.657
I didn't come to come here,
I wanted to see you.

03:54.484 --> 03:55.576
Well...

03:56.987 --> 03:59.661
I'm seeing you now, right?

04:05.829 --> 04:07.376
Do you miss home?

04:10.250 --> 04:11.422
This is home.

04:11.501 --> 04:13.048
No, I mean real home.

04:14.671 --> 04:15.763
Earth.

04:18.007 --> 04:19.055
No.

04:20.844 --> 04:22.016
No, I love it out here.

04:22.512 --> 04:24.514
Mom says you're just running away.

04:28.351 --> 04:30.711
Yeah, well, I haven't spoken
to your mother for a long time.

04:31.897 --> 04:33.207
She doesn't know what's going on out here.

04:33.231 --> 04:34.278
True.

04:36.193 --> 04:38.171
(Kane) It's not every day you get to be
part of something new.

04:38.195 --> 04:39.538
I'm making history out here.

04:41.865 --> 04:44.288
We're building an entirely new world
from the ground up.

04:45.035 --> 04:46.787
Pretty crappy world so far.

04:51.416 --> 04:53.589
(Kane) All right, you know what?
Let's take a detour.

04:53.710 --> 04:55.132
Got something I think you'll like.

05:01.134 --> 05:02.574
(Kane) I say we call that one a hit.

05:02.886 --> 05:05.264
No way, Dad. One more, I can do it.

05:05.388 --> 05:07.116
We don't have time.
We've gotta get moving. We're late.

05:07.140 --> 05:08.392
Come on. One more, please.

05:08.433 --> 05:10.060
- Last one?
- Last one.

05:10.143 --> 05:11.395
(Flies buzzing)

05:11.478 --> 05:12.570
OK, hand it over.

05:13.396 --> 05:15.036
Then we've got to go inspect this bunker.

05:15.065 --> 05:17.238
Does this bunker have visor games,

05:17.275 --> 05:19.744
or a hot tub or maybe a bowling alley?

05:19.820 --> 05:22.073
It's a bunker. It's got supplies and food.

05:22.823 --> 05:24.075
That would be boring.

05:24.157 --> 05:26.080
God, I hate these flies.

05:27.744 --> 05:28.984
Know what we call 'em out here?

05:30.580 --> 05:32.958
Spies. You know why?

05:33.583 --> 05:34.630
Enlighten me.

05:35.418 --> 05:37.011
Cos they're space flies.

05:37.087 --> 05:38.430
(Chuckles)

05:40.257 --> 05:45.479
Get it? Exor brought 'em out
on a cargo ship and they're in space...

05:45.595 --> 05:48.157
Why do we even need safety bunkers
when everything's already safe?

05:48.181 --> 05:50.604
Oh, it's just Exor protocol.

05:51.810 --> 05:55.656
You know, sometimes, there's an accident

05:55.772 --> 05:57.500
or something unexpected
and we need a safe place

05:57.524 --> 05:59.276
to get the General and the dignitaries.

05:59.317 --> 06:00.944
Why are they so important?

06:01.319 --> 06:03.617
Because in times of crisis,
we need leadership.

06:03.697 --> 06:05.165
(Flies continue buzzing)

06:06.867 --> 06:08.494
Otherwise, it just becomes anarchy.

06:09.119 --> 06:11.713
- Anarchy?
- Yeah. You know, chaos.

06:12.622 --> 06:13.794
Disorder.

06:15.792 --> 06:16.884
People going crazy.

06:16.960 --> 06:19.304
- Oh, like zombies.
- Yeah, kind of like zombies.

06:23.300 --> 06:24.677
- Got it?
- Yeah.

06:25.218 --> 06:27.471
- Keep that shoulder relaxed.
- Yep.

06:28.138 --> 06:30.357
- Focus on your breathing.
- Mmm-hmm.

06:31.182 --> 06:33.560
- Which way did you miss last time?
- Right.

06:33.685 --> 06:35.232
So, which way you gonna aim this time?

06:35.687 --> 06:37.030
(Indi) A little left.

06:37.856 --> 06:40.029
- What's the wind doing?
- I... I got it.

06:40.150 --> 06:41.868
You got it?

06:41.985 --> 06:43.362
You sure?

06:43.987 --> 06:44.988
- Squeeze it...
- (Fires)

06:45.488 --> 06:46.489
(Kane) Whoa!

06:48.825 --> 06:50.498
Ha-ha! That's my girl!

06:50.535 --> 06:52.333
- Whoo!
- Whoo! Good shot.

06:52.412 --> 06:54.335
Best... shot... ever.

06:54.414 --> 06:55.711
Best teacher ever.

06:58.209 --> 06:59.586
OK, next stop, bunker.

06:59.669 --> 07:03.014
And then I have to drop you back in the
city. Got Rominja coming to stay with you.

07:03.048 --> 07:04.721
Dad, I don't need a nanny.

07:05.342 --> 07:07.845
Why can't I stay up in
the Flotilla with you?

07:07.886 --> 07:10.389
(Kane) Because the Flotilla
is a military base.

07:10.513 --> 07:12.393
And trust me, it's even
less fun than a bunker.

07:13.600 --> 07:14.897
But I'll be back in a week.

07:15.518 --> 07:17.278
And you know you can call me
any time, right?

07:17.687 --> 07:19.968
I'm just gonna be up there in the clouds,
right above you.

07:24.861 --> 07:26.863
(Men shouting indistinctly)

07:26.905 --> 07:29.033
(Indi) Do all those
prisoners get paid to work?

07:29.115 --> 07:31.243
(Kane scoffs) Paid? No.

07:32.077 --> 07:33.679
No, they don't get paid.
It's called reform.

07:33.703 --> 07:35.705
They work to pay back
their debt to society.

07:35.789 --> 07:37.391
(Indi) How do you know
when they've done enough?

07:37.415 --> 07:40.715
(Kane) Those types of people,
they could never do enough.

07:43.421 --> 07:44.798
(Thunder cracking)

07:44.881 --> 07:46.804
<i>(Man on radio)
Anybody! Can anybody hear me?</i>

07:46.883 --> 07:49.056
<i>It's coming toward us
and the prison is breached!</i>

07:49.094 --> 07:50.596
<i>It's out of control!</i>

07:50.720 --> 07:53.314
<i>Whatever these things are,
they killed everything in their path!</i>

07:53.473 --> 07:54.565
(Creature roaring)

07:58.603 --> 07:59.650
(Growls)

08:09.614 --> 08:11.082
(Roaring)

08:17.747 --> 08:19.420
Travek, what's the time?

08:19.457 --> 08:21.004
- (Travek) Time to get up.
- (Groans)

08:21.126 --> 08:22.423
(Jets whooshing)

08:27.924 --> 08:29.016
<i>Good morning, Lieutenant.</i>

08:29.134 --> 08:30.181
(Snaps fingers)

08:33.679 --> 08:34.772
(Groans)

08:37.683 --> 08:38.775
(Coffeemaker beeps)

08:38.809 --> 08:39.857
(Coffee pouring)

08:44.149 --> 08:45.275
(Lights powering up)

08:45.316 --> 08:46.943
Oh no, no. Down.

08:48.111 --> 08:49.613
<i>(Travek) Rise and shine.</i>

08:49.654 --> 08:50.951
Down.

08:50.989 --> 08:52.115
(Powers down)

08:52.198 --> 08:55.623
<i>I am reading higher than normal
alcohol levels in your bloodstream, sir.</i>

08:57.871 --> 08:59.765
<i>- You have seven infrastructure reports...
- (Sighs)</i>

08:59.789 --> 09:01.132
<i>to go through.</i>

09:01.875 --> 09:03.877
<i>And you have three new messages.</i>

09:03.960 --> 09:05.303
Play messages.

09:05.503 --> 09:07.471
<i>Location, Flotilla.</i>

09:07.505 --> 09:08.691
(Secretary Millan) Sommerville.

09:08.715 --> 09:11.514
<i>I heard you snuck down
to the outpost last night.</i>

09:12.302 --> 09:14.350
<i>I'm just wondering why you
never think to invite me?</i>

09:14.471 --> 09:15.848
Cos you're an asshole.

09:15.972 --> 09:18.284
<i>Anyway man, I got that stuff you wanted
but it's gonna cost double.</i>

09:18.308 --> 09:19.493
- Delete message.
- So, <i>give</i> me a <i>call.</i>

09:19.517 --> 09:21.144
<i>(Travek) Location, Earth.</i>

09:21.186 --> 09:22.997
<i>(April) Kane, the deal with Indi
going out there</i>

09:23.021 --> 09:25.740
<i>was that you actually spend
quality time with her.</i>

09:25.815 --> 09:29.160
<i>And taking her shooting while you're
at work is not what I'm talking about.</i>

09:29.194 --> 09:30.241
Next message.

09:30.320 --> 09:32.072
<i>(Travek) Location, Osiris.</i>

09:32.197 --> 09:33.323
<i>(Indi) Hey, Dad.</i>

09:33.406 --> 09:37.331
<i>I called in late because I thought
you might be in, but obviously not.</i>

09:37.869 --> 09:39.337
<i>(Rominja) Evening, Mr Sommerville.</i>

09:39.704 --> 09:42.753
<i>Oh, we picked some of these ourselves
from the greenhouse.</i>

09:43.083 --> 09:45.506
<i>- (Rominja) Oh, they're good, right?
- Yeah, delish.</i>

09:46.169 --> 09:49.218
<i>We have an excursion that I've been
trying to get your indent on</i>

09:49.339 --> 09:51.592
<i>and if I don't by tomorrow
I'm going to miss out.</i>

09:51.674 --> 09:55.269
<i>Which kinda sucks, unless you want me
to keep having no friends at all.</i>

09:56.721 --> 09:58.894
<i>(Rominja) It's just to
the Sentient Ranges, uh,</i>

09:59.015 --> 10:02.189
<i>just for the day, and I
have all the details</i>

10:02.227 --> 10:06.027
<i>but I know you want to sign off on
everything, so, we waited for you.</i>

10:06.064 --> 10:07.532
<i>(Indi) She waited for you.</i>

10:09.025 --> 10:11.699
<i>(Rominja) Oh, and I think your new
neighbours are moving in.</i>

10:11.736 --> 10:13.613
<i>I heard somebody in there yesterday.</i>

10:13.696 --> 10:17.451
<i>They have a young boy.
So, that should be quite fun for Indi.</i>

10:17.534 --> 10:19.536
- (Indi) <i>Boys</i> are so annoying.
- That's my girl.

10:20.120 --> 10:22.464
<i>Oh, and Dad, Mom also called.</i>

10:22.539 --> 10:25.543
<i>She wanted to talk to you about some
Europe trip her and her new boyfriend,</i>

10:25.583 --> 10:27.130
<i>Todd, are thinking of.</i>

10:27.210 --> 10:28.450
(Feed scrambles and terminates)

10:29.379 --> 10:31.052
Who the hell is Todd?

10:31.089 --> 10:33.091
<i>(Travek) I can't answer that, sir.</i>

10:33.216 --> 10:35.059
Travek, restore the feed. Now.

10:35.093 --> 10:36.219
<i>I</i> cannot.

10:36.302 --> 10:37.622
<i>All communications to the surface</i>

10:37.720 --> 10:40.223
<i>- have been temporarily disrupted.
- (Sighs)</i>

10:40.265 --> 10:43.235
That is helpful.

10:43.935 --> 10:45.621
We have an ETA
on when they're coming back up?

10:45.645 --> 10:47.568
<i>Not at this time, Lieutenant.</i>

10:47.605 --> 10:49.073
<i>But I assure you</i>

10:49.149 --> 10:51.902
<i>we are doing our very best
to rectify the problem.</i>

10:51.943 --> 10:53.160
Yeah, I bet you are.

10:54.904 --> 10:57.783
Travek, send an Ingram to my daughter
as soon as you can.

10:57.907 --> 11:00.956
Tell her, of course, she has my permission
to go on the excursion

11:01.327 --> 11:03.580
and you will forward my indent today.

11:04.247 --> 11:07.127
Travek, do we have any more information
on the disturbance at the prison?

11:07.417 --> 11:09.010
<i>Not at this time, sir.</i>

11:09.794 --> 11:10.920
Travek?

11:11.004 --> 11:12.176
<i>Yes, Lieutenant.</i>

11:15.258 --> 11:17.761
Find out everything you can
on this Todd guy.

11:17.802 --> 11:18.974
<i>Yes, Lieutenant.</i>

11:26.769 --> 11:30.273
<i>(Indi) In the race to colonize
new planets,</i>

11:30.315 --> 11:33.034
<i>Exor was the undisputed leader.</i>

11:33.109 --> 11:37.455
<i>Trusted by the hundreds of millions
who lived and worked under its rule.</i>

11:38.698 --> 11:41.952
<i>Which is why the General
could never let them know</i>

11:41.993 --> 11:44.792
<i>of the project she'd
been assigned to oversee</i>

11:44.871 --> 11:46.794
<i>in the prison far below.</i>

11:47.624 --> 11:49.977
- (Automated voice) Secure <i>line playback.</i>
- (Recording plays)

11:50.001 --> 11:52.104
(Man) <i>It's coming toward us
and the prison is breached.</i>

11:52.128 --> 11:53.630
<i>It's out of control!</i>

11:53.671 --> 11:56.345
<i>Whatever these things are,
they've killed everything in their path.</i>

11:56.466 --> 11:58.027
<i>I don't know what the
hell is happening here,</i>

11:58.051 --> 11:59.644
<i>but the goddamned prisoners are out.</i>

11:59.677 --> 12:02.521
<i>They are out. These things are everywhere!</i>

12:02.639 --> 12:03.640
(Man screams)

12:03.806 --> 12:05.524
<i>(Automated voice) End transmission.</i>

12:07.227 --> 12:09.229
<i>(Indi) In the only time I ever met her,</i>

12:09.312 --> 12:12.907
<i>she told me my name reminded her
of the state she grew up in.</i>

12:14.067 --> 12:15.159
Indiana.

12:16.653 --> 12:21.409
<i>I should have known then that she was more
concerned with her own place in the universe</i>

12:21.491 --> 12:23.914
<i>than the people who actually lived in it.</i>

12:28.498 --> 12:31.217
(Colonel Michaels)
General, the outer cities are gone.

12:31.334 --> 12:34.713
These creatures are going to
kill everything on the surface

12:34.837 --> 12:36.680
and this is our responsibility now.

12:37.382 --> 12:38.679
We created them.

12:39.175 --> 12:42.600
This is coming to the point
where we won't be able to turn back.

12:46.015 --> 12:50.020
If you were in my position, Colonel,
how would you resolve this?

12:50.728 --> 12:51.854
Ethically?

12:52.021 --> 12:55.241
We save as many people as we can

12:55.358 --> 12:56.530
and then tell the truth.

12:56.567 --> 12:59.195
If our involvement in
this were known it would

12:59.237 --> 13:00.739
cripple the company.

13:02.198 --> 13:06.419
The fallout would destroy
generations of sacrifice and legacy.

13:07.787 --> 13:10.256
How long can we honestly maintain
this Comms blackout?

13:11.124 --> 13:13.593
Command won't get wind of it
for a couple of days.

13:14.877 --> 13:17.881
By then, we should
have the situation resolved.

13:17.964 --> 13:19.056
Resolved?

13:20.425 --> 13:22.723
This isn't a maintenance issue here.

13:22.802 --> 13:24.725
It's a population in the hundreds
of thousands.

13:24.762 --> 13:26.560
Our people have families down there.

13:26.597 --> 13:30.101
Millions of lives are at stake

13:30.226 --> 13:33.230
if public outrage shuts down this company.

13:33.271 --> 13:36.241
If we're found out,
what's the worst they can hit us with?

13:36.316 --> 13:37.659
Genocide.

13:40.236 --> 13:42.455
And, while that would be
only one of the charges,

13:43.406 --> 13:46.910
(Inhales) it would be the one
that sticks forever.

13:46.993 --> 13:49.997
The one that our grandchildren
remember us by.

13:57.253 --> 13:59.756
We must not fail.

14:01.758 --> 14:02.805
Of course.

14:04.927 --> 14:06.474
(Exhales)

14:06.763 --> 14:08.310
Call the meeting.

14:11.017 --> 14:12.439
(Wind howling)

14:14.354 --> 14:16.197
(General Lynex) I regret to report

14:17.190 --> 14:20.535
that we are now considering
that the prison has been breached.

14:22.278 --> 14:26.033
The prisoners are in possession
of a lethal Etholanide virus.

14:27.658 --> 14:30.832
We've been informed that any attempt
by us to intervene in any way

14:30.953 --> 14:34.298
or extract any person
or persons from the surface

14:34.374 --> 14:37.969
will be met with the release of the
pathogen into the Capital, Osiris.

14:40.046 --> 14:41.514
(Kane) Sommerville, Kane.

14:41.631 --> 14:43.554
<i>- (Travek) You sound distressed.
- Listen to me.</i>

14:43.633 --> 14:46.807
I need to get a message to Indi
by whatever means possible. Can I do it?

14:46.844 --> 14:48.471
<i>Not at this time, sir.</i>

14:49.555 --> 14:53.526
I want a tag on every single person
at this table for the next 23 hours.

14:54.310 --> 14:56.233
Any unusual movement, isolate them.

14:58.022 --> 14:59.148
Colonel.

15:01.317 --> 15:02.739
This could work.

15:06.656 --> 15:09.468
(Kane) Here's what I need. I need a marked
timeline on all incident reports

15:09.492 --> 15:12.712
from the Capital and the prison every day
for the last seven days. Can I do that?

15:13.413 --> 15:15.711
<i>(Travek) That information
is now classified.</i>

15:16.582 --> 15:18.209
Classified under what jurisdiction?

15:18.334 --> 15:19.881
(Door alarm beeping)

15:24.507 --> 15:26.885
(indistinct announcement over PA)

15:29.595 --> 15:31.689
For the sake of our friendship,

15:31.722 --> 15:32.866
I'm going to tell you the truth.

15:32.890 --> 15:34.016
After that, it's on you.

15:35.393 --> 15:37.441
Most of what you just heard was a lie.

15:37.520 --> 15:38.737
There is no virus.

15:41.274 --> 15:45.279
The prisoners are in possession
of a lethal Etholanide virus.

15:45.361 --> 15:46.505
(Secretary Millan) That's preposterous.

15:46.529 --> 15:49.032
Etholanide is comparable
to a grade-six bioweapon.

15:49.699 --> 15:53.545
It can't even be certified to transport
here, let alone be housed inside a prison.

15:53.578 --> 15:56.206
The prison facility
has a classified research arm

15:56.289 --> 15:58.587
to help fight and prevent disease
on emerging planets.

15:58.708 --> 16:01.211
- So, we grew it here?
- Yes, we grew it.

16:02.211 --> 16:05.611
Five years ago, we did build a facility inside
the prison, but it wasn't for research.

16:06.048 --> 16:08.142
We were breeding a beast called a Ragged.

16:08.759 --> 16:11.729
The idea was to contain these beasts
until there were enough of them

16:11.804 --> 16:14.408
and ship them out of there and use them
in the creation of new colonies

16:14.432 --> 16:16.810
to kill or assimilate indigenous species.

16:18.269 --> 16:21.148
Our prisoners have commandeered
three local supply freighters

16:21.230 --> 16:23.608
and are demanding safe passage
out of the system.

16:24.567 --> 16:28.663
That virus has the potential
to kill all colonies in this galaxy.

16:28.905 --> 16:32.250
By duty of order,
a stage-six threat must invoke

16:32.658 --> 16:34.410
Protocol 84.

16:35.077 --> 16:38.422
Protocol 84 requires
an entire decimation of colony.

16:39.290 --> 16:41.588
However, when the prisoners become aware

16:41.667 --> 16:43.761
of our obligation to invoke the protocol,

16:43.836 --> 16:45.509
I believe we will have

16:45.588 --> 16:49.263
a strong position to negotiate
a more favourable outcome.

16:49.342 --> 16:50.969
There is no hostage situation.

16:51.093 --> 16:52.766
Eight hours ago,

16:52.803 --> 16:56.478
the Raggeds broke free from the enclosure,
and there's carnage in the city.

16:56.599 --> 16:59.352
They're moving toward the Capital.
Kane, it's out of control.

16:59.435 --> 17:02.029
Have they supplied us with a deadline?

17:02.104 --> 17:04.448
We have 23 hours, 11 minutes.

17:06.776 --> 17:08.503
- (Colonel Michaels) It's a cover up.
- (Watch beeping)

17:08.528 --> 17:11.327
<i>In 23 hours, we're gonna blow the reactors.</i>

17:12.615 --> 17:14.288
To them it's just collateral damage.

17:14.367 --> 17:16.790
A mining strip, couple
of cities and a prison.

17:16.868 --> 17:19.792
Every single person on that surface
is there because we put them there.

17:19.829 --> 17:21.173
Because of this organization.

17:21.290 --> 17:24.310
- The General is well aware of the situation...
- (General Lynex) Lieutenant.

17:24.335 --> 17:27.305
I'm aware you have a little girl
alone in the Capital.

17:27.338 --> 17:28.635
You moved me out here

17:28.673 --> 17:30.971
and you knew all along
that this was going on?

17:31.050 --> 17:33.770
The chances of this happening are
so minute, I'm not even going to...

17:33.803 --> 17:36.532
- (Shouts) You let me move my family here!
- I'm not going to argue, OK?

17:36.556 --> 17:39.309
Trust me when I tell you
that we're looking at every angle here.

17:40.351 --> 17:43.025
And I believe that we are gonna
come out of this just fine,

17:43.145 --> 17:44.897
as will your families

17:44.981 --> 17:47.325
and all the other folks down there
on the surface.

17:47.400 --> 17:49.994
They're going to lock down the hangar bay
in the next 20 minutes

17:50.069 --> 17:52.322
at which point no one
can get on or off the station.

17:52.989 --> 17:55.492
<i>(Genera Lynex) But we have to stay calm.
Have a little faith.</i>

17:56.534 --> 17:57.831
We will endure.

17:59.996 --> 18:01.669
We will endure.

18:03.165 --> 18:04.965
(Colonel Michaels)
You're her only hope, Kane.

18:05.418 --> 18:07.512
I just hope you're still
the pilot I remember.

18:11.090 --> 18:13.218
- (Missile explodes)
- (Jet whooshing)

22:04.114 --> 22:05.161
Who are you?

22:07.493 --> 22:08.961
Doesn't matter who I am.

22:10.037 --> 22:12.085
You got a gun pointed at you.

22:12.164 --> 22:14.337
So, why don't you tell
me what you're doing,

22:14.416 --> 22:16.293
cos I just saw you fall from the sky.

22:18.379 --> 22:19.596
(Groans softly)

22:26.929 --> 22:28.055
I was escaping.

22:32.184 --> 22:34.232
Prison's down here.

22:34.311 --> 22:35.563
Not up there.

22:37.356 --> 22:39.074
I'm not a prisoner, but I am a dead man.

22:40.359 --> 22:42.361
If you keep sitting here
like this, so are you.

22:42.486 --> 22:44.409
Now, am I supposed to
take that as a threat?

22:44.488 --> 22:47.037
No, it's not a threat. It's a fact.

22:48.158 --> 22:51.287
We've got just under 22 hours
before this place becomes a dead zone.

22:51.829 --> 22:53.109
You talking about the creatures?

22:54.415 --> 22:55.667
What creatures?

22:57.626 --> 23:00.175
You tell me your problems,
I'll consider telling you mine.

23:03.382 --> 23:05.476
There's a hostage situation at the prison.

23:06.594 --> 23:08.488
The inmates have control
of the nuclear reactors.

23:08.512 --> 23:09.792
They're threatening to blow 'em.

23:10.139 --> 23:12.267
If they do, it's going
to happen in 22 hours.

23:13.434 --> 23:14.981
Is that what they told you up there?

23:17.521 --> 23:19.944
Cos I was there when that riot happened.

23:21.400 --> 23:23.368
Sector 2 Ward Nurse.

23:23.444 --> 23:26.072
Now, I know for a fact
that there's no one left in that prison.

23:26.155 --> 23:28.954
So, either they're lying to you,
or you are lying to me.

23:32.995 --> 23:34.497
I am no threat to you.

23:34.580 --> 23:36.308
So, how about we forget
this ever happened...

23:36.332 --> 23:37.584
Sit down!

23:38.876 --> 23:40.378
You can't make it on your own.

23:41.670 --> 23:43.547
Not with those things out there.

23:43.631 --> 23:44.803
Well then help me!

23:46.342 --> 23:48.811
Because sitting here
getting to know each other isn't working.

23:48.886 --> 23:50.103
You want my help?

23:50.179 --> 23:51.647
What can you do for me?

23:51.722 --> 23:53.158
Why don't you tell me
what exactly is out there?

23:53.182 --> 23:54.502
Why don't you offer me something?

23:57.102 --> 23:59.104
We have 22 hours left

23:59.188 --> 24:01.065
before they blow up this entire planet.

24:01.148 --> 24:02.946
You said that. Good luck.

24:04.109 --> 24:05.201
You're gonna need it.

24:09.448 --> 24:10.950
I have to save my daughter!

24:12.493 --> 24:14.996
She's 11 years old,
and she's alone in the Capital.

24:17.456 --> 24:18.582
Help me!

24:20.501 --> 24:23.175
If I don't get there, she will die.

24:29.718 --> 24:31.891
And I guarantee that no one
up there gives a shit

24:31.971 --> 24:33.723
about anybody down here.

24:46.652 --> 24:48.074
And?

24:50.280 --> 24:53.159
I have access to a military grade
safety bunker.

24:54.118 --> 24:55.540
You help me get to the Capital,

24:56.537 --> 24:58.039
you help me find my daughter,

25:00.290 --> 25:01.633
I will give you refuge.

25:04.378 --> 25:06.096
How's that for an offer?

25:08.841 --> 25:10.889
You're gonna have to trust me on that.

25:12.136 --> 25:13.308
It's tough down here.

25:15.681 --> 25:17.274
Trust has to be earned.

25:22.604 --> 25:23.696
I don't have time for that.

25:23.772 --> 25:24.989
(Sy) Hey.

25:26.066 --> 25:27.113
Hey!

25:29.653 --> 25:31.075
You want the Capital, right?

25:35.159 --> 25:36.581
Osiris is that way.

25:40.372 --> 25:41.419
You need to go east.

25:48.380 --> 25:49.472
OK.

25:58.015 --> 25:59.107
Nice jacket.

26:11.153 --> 26:13.673
(Warden Mourdain over PA)
Your <i>life</i> ended the <i>day</i> you were sentenced-

26:13.697 --> 26:16.325
<i>You are no longer a person.</i>

26:16.408 --> 26:19.958
<i>You are no longer valued by the human race.</i>

26:22.581 --> 26:24.424

<i>and serve</i>

26:30.172 --> 26:34.097

26:34.635 --> 26:37.730
(indistinct announcement over PA)

26:38.388 --> 26:43.394
Every day, I find one of these hairs

26:43.477 --> 26:44.899
in my meal.

26:46.105 --> 26:49.325
And I know where it comes from.
I know the Warden

26:50.192 --> 26:52.991
he goes into the kitchen

26:53.070 --> 26:55.414
and he takes one of his hairs

26:55.489 --> 26:58.038
and he puts it in my food.

26:58.742 --> 27:00.744
You see that? You see that, Vim?

27:01.662 --> 27:02.754
Always.

27:04.039 --> 27:05.211
(Vim) All clear.

27:06.500 --> 27:07.547
All right.

27:08.001 --> 27:10.174
Carmel's serving solitary. He has the key.

27:10.921 --> 27:12.649
You guys remember his drawing
from last week, right?

27:12.673 --> 27:13.890
Yeah.

27:13.966 --> 27:15.434
The only part missing

27:15.509 --> 27:18.683
is getting the hexon filament,
divert it from the emergency release.

27:19.054 --> 27:21.352
You actually understood all of that?

27:22.141 --> 27:25.486
Didn't he say we needed a conduit
of some kind?

27:25.561 --> 27:27.780
Yeah. That part's simple.

27:28.105 --> 27:30.403
Our socks. The cotton fibres.

27:31.150 --> 27:33.118
- That's it?
- Any one of us could do it.

27:33.193 --> 27:37.619
Carmel also lost his mind
on that last stint in solitary.

27:37.698 --> 27:41.703
Gentlemen, we need to question
the validity of this information.

27:41.785 --> 27:44.709
He might have been jacking off
onto that lamp post for all we know.

27:44.788 --> 27:46.085
Quiet.

27:49.126 --> 27:53.176
Besides, we can't even
get inside the spectral tubing.

27:53.255 --> 27:54.677
It's pressure sealed.

27:54.756 --> 27:56.929
We can't even get to the filament.

27:57.009 --> 28:00.263
We can't get to it. So, why are
we even talking about this, huh?

28:00.345 --> 28:02.143
Carmel's already gotten into one.

28:03.515 --> 28:04.687
Undetected.

28:05.517 --> 28:07.110
- Bullshit.
- No.

28:07.186 --> 28:09.063
That's why we need to move. Now.

28:09.146 --> 28:10.614
Before they discover that.

28:11.398 --> 28:12.490
Which Cell?

28:14.026 --> 28:15.118
He doesn't know.

28:15.652 --> 28:17.120
(Laughing)

28:18.488 --> 28:20.240
He doesn't know. They all look alike.

28:20.324 --> 28:22.622
- He doesn't know?
- (Charles) Of course he doesn't know.

28:22.701 --> 28:23.998
He's insane.

28:25.245 --> 28:26.337
(Plate clatters)

28:29.625 --> 28:32.549
Insanity is a very common affliction
around these parts.

28:33.337 --> 28:34.634
(Sy) This is our only shot.

28:35.672 --> 28:37.970
We just need every solitary cell full.

28:38.050 --> 28:40.553
It's the only way to ensure
that one of us is in the right one.

28:41.345 --> 28:42.392
Then we get free.

28:43.138 --> 28:45.687
Get access to the system via the guard post

28:45.766 --> 28:48.690
and trigger the emergency release
to all the cells.

28:50.479 --> 28:52.072
Is Bostok's group still in?

28:54.650 --> 28:55.697
(Sniffs)

29:03.784 --> 29:06.082
They remain decidedly undecided.

29:06.161 --> 29:08.255
(Kreat laughing) Of course, of course!

29:08.330 --> 29:11.880
Cos any way you think on
it, it's a suicide run.

29:11.959 --> 29:14.382
You hear that? Suicide.

29:14.461 --> 29:15.883
They just want more time.

29:16.755 --> 29:19.178
(Kreat muttering)
More time, more time. More time for what?

29:20.467 --> 29:24.472
(Warden Mourdain)
Well, well, well, Mr Carmel.

29:25.555 --> 29:27.774
What is it about solitary

29:27.849 --> 29:31.103
that you love so much, hmm?

29:33.689 --> 29:35.032
Is this yours?

29:38.527 --> 29:41.030
Looks like you're already
ahead of the game.

29:41.697 --> 29:44.496
I find, in here many turn to God

29:44.783 --> 29:48.833
in a desperate realization that their life
has no meaning any more.

29:50.998 --> 29:53.342
So, they pray to a fictitious idol

29:53.417 --> 29:55.761
and tell themselves they're forgiven

29:56.211 --> 29:59.431
as a way to deal with the guilt
of what they've done.

30:00.465 --> 30:02.012
But that's all up here.

30:02.718 --> 30:04.516
Because in reality

30:04.594 --> 30:07.973
if there's a heaven, there
must be a hell, too.

30:09.099 --> 30:10.817
And while I don't believe in any of that

30:12.811 --> 30:15.280
it's still my job to make
good on the idea of it.

30:16.106 --> 30:17.278
So, have faith.

30:18.400 --> 30:23.702
Have faith that this place will become
your own personal hell.

30:25.574 --> 30:26.996
(Laughing)

30:34.124 --> 30:37.754
Maybe you think this is my first stint
in a place like this.

30:39.004 --> 30:42.725
My first time dealing

30:42.799 --> 30:47.305
with a limp-dick loudmouth like you.

30:50.599 --> 30:51.691
I do.

30:54.936 --> 30:56.438
(Chuckles derisively)

30:58.732 --> 31:02.236
Because there's nothing like this place
anywhere else.

31:03.653 --> 31:06.076
We don't even exist under UNSI law...

31:06.156 --> 31:09.251
Am I supposed to care

31:09.326 --> 31:10.623
about any of this?

31:10.702 --> 31:11.749
(Exhales)

31:13.413 --> 31:14.756
Yes, you are.

31:15.957 --> 31:17.004
But you don't.

31:19.378 --> 31:21.676
And that's why you're here.

31:22.506 --> 31:26.431
There'll be no more solitary
for you, Mr Carmel.

31:31.056 --> 31:32.148
Do you understand?

31:39.606 --> 31:41.199
(Groaning)

31:44.236 --> 31:46.580
You think I didn't have a hard life?

31:47.656 --> 31:50.500
You think I didn't have
the same choices you did?

31:51.410 --> 31:53.458
- (Groans)
- Get him up!

31:55.247 --> 31:57.124
The next time you see me,

31:57.999 --> 32:00.798
you show me some goddamn respect!

32:01.420 --> 32:02.592
- (Grunting)
- (Groaning)

32:02.671 --> 32:04.389
Get this maggot out of here!

32:04.464 --> 32:06.091
Straight to the lower cages.

32:11.346 --> 32:12.518
(Chuckles)

32:17.227 --> 32:21.152
You know how many guys go into solitary
and they don't come back?

32:21.731 --> 32:23.779
How many boys we lost, huh?

32:24.484 --> 32:27.408
How many boys don't come back?

32:27.529 --> 32:29.009
But, Kreat, let me ask you something.

32:29.156 --> 32:30.624
How long is your sentence?

32:31.408 --> 32:32.830
Fifty-seven years left.

32:34.286 --> 32:35.913
In this place.

32:37.247 --> 32:39.170
Look, brother,
you're never getting out of here.

32:40.375 --> 32:42.002
Vim and I,

32:42.085 --> 32:43.678
we're never getting out of here.

32:44.754 --> 32:46.347
Unless we do something about it.

32:48.967 --> 32:50.093
(Vim) It's now or never.

32:50.218 --> 32:51.686
It's dark and day.

32:51.761 --> 32:53.263
It's the same

32:53.346 --> 32:54.939
shit stinking soul.

32:56.099 --> 32:57.146
Kreat?

32:58.685 --> 33:00.028
Please.

33:02.063 --> 33:03.189
Bostok's in.

33:05.484 --> 33:06.701
Are you in, Vim?

33:08.195 --> 33:10.072
Let's burn this place to the ground.

33:11.531 --> 33:12.999
(Laughs)

33:14.034 --> 33:16.002
(Sy) I need you two to rally the troops.

33:16.620 --> 33:17.963
Don't leave me hanging.

33:26.922 --> 33:27.969
- (Thuds)
- (Grunting)

33:28.465 --> 33:29.967
(Inmates clamouring)

33:32.177 --> 33:34.155
<i>(Genera Lynex on speaker)
Good day to you, Warden Mourdain.</i>

33:34.179 --> 33:35.396
And you, General Lynex.

33:35.472 --> 33:37.825
<i>I was just hoping to get
your thoughts on the latest report.</i>

33:37.849 --> 33:39.897
<i>This progress seems quite astounding.</i>

33:39.976 --> 33:42.729
Well, we are dealing
with some exceptional source material.

33:42.812 --> 33:46.282
And my staff are extremely passionate
about making this work.

33:46.858 --> 33:49.657
<i>Photosynthetic skin shrouds.
Regenerative limbs.</i>

33:50.946 --> 33:54.416
<i>At this rate, we'll be looking at our first
deployment in a matter of months.</i>

33:55.075 --> 33:59.455
There are certain qualities that seem
evident in the top spectrum of the report.

34:02.165 --> 34:03.792
(Clamouring continues)

34:10.297 --> 34:13.141
<i>Confident you can maintain
this level of success?</i>

34:13.385 --> 34:14.931
(Alarm blaring)

34:15.554 --> 34:16.851
<i>Is there a problem, Warden?</i>

34:17.764 --> 34:19.107
Nothing I can't handle.

34:19.891 --> 34:21.688
We'll chat soon. Bye-bye.

34:56.428 --> 34:57.680

I just wanted to come down here

We're going to have to sedate you.

hurt yourself down here.

Not on foot, we won't.

40:07.030 --> 40:08.407
Am I missing something?

40:10.950 --> 40:13.954
(Kane) Just beyond those mountains
is a contraband outpost.

40:14.412 --> 40:16.460
(Sy) What's your plan once we get there?

40:16.539 --> 40:18.416
(Kane) Figure that out when we get there.

40:19.834 --> 40:22.212

43:40.493 --> 43:42.040
(Bill) And that is your opener!

43:42.703 --> 43:44.296
- (Kane) You find that?
- (Grunts)

43:44.705 --> 43:46.252
Not in the moments that count.

43:50.169 --> 43:51.967
Well, you're a better man than me.

43:53.172 --> 43:54.389
Maybe.

43:56.008 --> 43:57.134
(Man whistling)

43:57.218 --> 43:59.058
(Bill) What you doin'?
Let's have another game.

44:00.304 --> 44:01.601
Ah, come on.

44:01.889 --> 44:02.936
Does he not listen?

44:04.058 --> 44:05.355
- Best of five.
- Hey!

44:05.685 --> 44:06.937
- Hey!
- (Sniffs) Mmm.

44:07.937 --> 44:09.280
That your bus parked out front?

44:09.355 --> 44:11.733
(Stammering) We're in the middle
of something here, huh?

44:11.816 --> 44:13.534
I need a ride to Osiris.

44:13.609 --> 44:14.735
I need to leave now.

44:14.902 --> 44:16.870
(Laughs) You're funny, man!

44:16.946 --> 44:18.118
(Gyp) Real fuckin' funny.

44:18.614 --> 44:19.786
(Kane grunts)

44:21.033 --> 44:22.125
(Grunting continues)

44:22.535 --> 44:25.084
- See?
- I ask her to do that to me every night.

44:26.122 --> 44:27.419
What you all lookin' at?

44:27.498 --> 44:29.045
I said, what you all lookin' at?

44:29.792 --> 44:31.965
Play your little domino weirdo game.

44:32.295 --> 44:34.844
(Whistles) Buddy, back to your game.

44:35.631 --> 44:37.099
- Play the music.
- (Glass shatters)

44:37.175 --> 44:38.392
Music! Play!

44:38.467 --> 44:39.684
<i>(♪ Rock music)</i>

44:41.929 --> 44:43.031
You might wanna go help him.

44:43.055 --> 44:44.773
Think we're a little taxi service?

44:44.891 --> 44:46.108
Is that what you think we are?

44:47.018 --> 44:48.361
What's your name, abdominal?

44:49.270 --> 44:50.442
My name is Kane.

44:50.521 --> 44:53.365
Kane?
Nah, you're not from around here, huh?

44:53.608 --> 44:54.985
I may need you to top that off.

44:57.445 --> 44:59.948
No, right now, I'm a very,
very long way from home.

45:00.448 --> 45:01.791
Which is why I need a ride.

45:02.617 --> 45:04.164
Me and my buddy at the bar.

45:06.746 --> 45:08.623
(Bill) Goddamn, look at you, man!

45:08.831 --> 45:11.550
I'm on my knees for you, man.
You're a perfect guy!

45:11.709 --> 45:12.756
(Gyp grunts)

45:12.835 --> 45:13.927
(Exclaims)

45:14.503 --> 45:15.880
You make the perfect couple.

45:18.132 --> 45:19.812
You belong on a magazine cover, don't you?

45:20.801 --> 45:22.223
But you don't belong out here, huh?

45:22.303 --> 45:23.725
Don't be shy now.

45:23.804 --> 45:25.852
- Come on over.
- Come play.

45:25.932 --> 45:27.479
(Gyp) Bill, I wanna take him home.

45:27.600 --> 45:28.817
(Bill) Oh, no, no, no.

45:28.893 --> 45:31.112
You take the bar lady home.
You don't take him home.

45:33.439 --> 45:35.237
I'm sorry about my friend here.

45:35.316 --> 45:36.738
Mmm-hmm. Thank you very much.

45:36.817 --> 45:37.943
It's that time of the month.

45:38.277 --> 45:39.403
Take a seat.

45:39.737 --> 45:41.910
Good cop over here knows how to do it.

45:41.989 --> 45:43.709
That's all you had to do. Bring me a drink.

45:44.492 --> 45:45.664
By the looks of it,

45:46.911 --> 45:48.254
you're military, right?

45:48.955 --> 45:50.252
(Kane panting)

45:50.331 --> 45:51.611
I'll pay you 10 grand one way...

45:52.250 --> 45:53.376
That ain't worth spit.

45:53.542 --> 45:54.885
You got a knife to your throat

45:55.836 --> 45:57.554
and you're still trying to talk turkey?

45:58.673 --> 46:00.141
Mmm-mmm, mmm-mmm.

46:00.341 --> 46:01.809
He's a defector of Exor.

46:02.343 --> 46:05.643
He's just trying to get back to his family
before they come after him.

46:06.097 --> 46:07.314
(Gyp) Mmm-hmm.

46:08.432 --> 46:09.479
Is that true?

46:10.851 --> 46:11.898
Yes, it is.

46:17.191 --> 46:18.613
- Cut his throat.
- No!

46:18.943 --> 46:21.867
You wanna pay me 10 grand for that?

46:22.029 --> 46:24.202
- Ten fuckin' grand?
- No, no, no, no, no!

46:24.615 --> 46:26.162
He's lyin' like a tombstone.

46:26.242 --> 46:27.869
I thought I heard him say 20.

46:28.244 --> 46:29.461
He did say 20.

46:32.873 --> 46:34.090
(Softly) Twenty.

46:34.166 --> 46:35.383
Twenty grand?

46:35.584 --> 46:37.712
<i>- I'll</i> give you 20 grand.
- Whoo-hoo!

46:37.795 --> 46:39.843
- (Gyp) Ah-
- Yeah! Let him go.

46:41.007 --> 46:43.260
- That's a whole big load of straw.
- (Gyp cheering)

46:43.342 --> 46:45.970
- Hey, that bus outside looks modified.
- (Bill) Mmm-hmm.

46:46.053 --> 46:47.350
Is that armour up to spec?

46:47.430 --> 46:49.728
Why you askin'? We gonna get shot at?

46:49.807 --> 46:51.059
We like to travel safe.

46:51.350 --> 46:53.569
I mean, we're talkin' about
no old prison bus here.

46:53.644 --> 46:57.239
We're talkin' about Gracie, aka...

46:57.898 --> 46:59.821
(Grunts) "My Momma." (Laughs)

47:00.318 --> 47:01.570
Yeah.

47:01.652 --> 47:04.747
You can come inside my Momma,
and she will take care of ya.

47:05.406 --> 47:08.501
Twenty grand. One way. Got a deal?

47:10.328 --> 47:11.545
Mmm...

47:11.620 --> 47:12.746
(Kane) Let's go.

47:13.164 --> 47:14.586
Not yet.

47:15.708 --> 47:17.130
You wanna ride with me?

47:18.002 --> 47:19.424
Wanna ride in my Momma?

47:19.795 --> 47:21.889
You gotta take a kiss on this.

47:22.048 --> 47:23.300
(Bill) Take a knee.

47:24.425 --> 47:25.642
OK.

47:26.594 --> 47:27.891
Lasts 20 seconds.

47:29.055 --> 47:31.308
You get the knife on the board,

47:31.807 --> 47:33.650
then we got ourselves a deal.

47:36.645 --> 47:38.192
(Inhales deeply)

47:45.154 --> 47:46.576
That'll make you dizzy.

47:51.702 --> 47:52.749
(Grunts)

47:53.454 --> 47:54.751
(Man whistles)

47:56.499 --> 47:57.842
(Woman) Oh, yeah!

47:58.626 --> 48:00.003
(Woman cheering)

48:00.086 --> 48:01.633
(Gyp) Well, look at you, Sparky.

48:03.005 --> 48:05.178
Got a bit of snap in that garter, huh?

48:07.635 --> 48:08.887
You got talent.

48:09.387 --> 48:11.560
Got yourself a deal! Whoo!

48:11.680 --> 48:12.760
We're gonna need some guns.

48:12.807 --> 48:14.409
- (Bill) Guns?
- So, we are gonna get shot at?

48:14.433 --> 48:16.401
Just like I said, we like to travel safe.

48:17.269 --> 48:19.863
- So, we can stop by Hopper and Mandel.
- (Chuckles)

48:19.939 --> 48:21.566
- But it'll cost ya.
- Cost ya.

48:22.775 --> 48:24.961
How far is this place?
How far to the Hopper and Mandel place?

48:24.985 --> 48:26.737
Oh, no, no, it's not that far.

48:26.821 --> 48:29.165
It's like about 30 minutes there and back.
Close enough.

48:29.240 --> 48:30.708
(GYP) Yeah.

48:32.118 --> 48:34.371
You wanna keep swapping spit
or should we hit the road?

49:00.438 --> 49:01.655
(Gagging)

49:01.772 --> 49:02.898
(coughing)

49:15.536 --> 49:16.879
(Metal clangs)

49:19.790 --> 49:21.792
(Door whirring)

49:23.002 --> 49:25.300
(Snarling and growling)

49:25.379 --> 49:26.722
(Metal clanging)

49:27.006 --> 49:28.599
(Snarling)

49:30.676 --> 49:32.678
(Footsteps approaching)

49:33.387 --> 49:35.139
(Growling)

49:37.433 --> 49:39.231
(Gasping)

49:41.812 --> 49:43.314
(Growling)

49:44.732 --> 49:46.530
(Sniffing)

49:55.284 --> 49:57.332
- (Roaring)
- (Screaming)

50:00.331 --> 50:01.958
(Distant screaming)

50:03.626 --> 50:05.299
(Breathing heavily)

50:10.216 --> 50:11.718
(Grunting)

50:14.762 --> 50:16.355
(Ragged roaring)

50:18.015 --> 50:21.064
(Warden Mourdain) Do you know
what terraforming is, Mr Lombrok?

50:23.103 --> 50:26.232
It's the act of making
a hostile environment

50:27.024 --> 50:28.697
habitable for humans.

50:29.860 --> 50:31.237
(Ragged roars)

50:31.320 --> 50:36.076
Unfortunately, many planets have indigenous
species that refuse to cooperate.

50:36.367 --> 50:40.417
We needed a more cost-effective way
of exterminating them.

50:41.997 --> 50:45.592
I'm telling you this
because I need you to understand,

50:46.085 --> 50:47.257
very clearly,

50:48.796 --> 50:51.470
what you have a chance to be a part of.

50:51.882 --> 50:53.054
(Roaring continues)

50:53.133 --> 50:56.307
Our friend next door
just met one of our all-star team.

50:57.805 --> 50:59.773
(Vim screaming)

51:00.349 --> 51:02.477
- (Continues screaming)
- (Ragged growling)

51:03.727 --> 51:06.071
Many of them your former prison inmates.

51:07.856 --> 51:08.982
And hopefully,

51:09.817 --> 51:12.366
his constitution withstanding,

51:12.444 --> 51:14.287
he'll soon be able to join them

51:15.406 --> 51:18.501
and become something he was unable to do

51:18.576 --> 51:20.453
as an inferior human.

51:21.745 --> 51:23.247
- (Roaring)
- (Screaming)

51:24.123 --> 51:26.376
(Screaming continues)

51:27.376 --> 51:29.845
A being capable of evolution...

51:30.421 --> 51:31.798
(Ragged growling)

51:31.880 --> 51:33.382
Adaptation,

51:34.717 --> 51:37.436
even in the hardest of environments.

51:38.554 --> 51:39.931
(Grunting)

51:40.180 --> 51:41.602
(Growling)

51:42.558 --> 51:46.233
I've seen what it takes
to survive the change.

51:47.229 --> 51:48.401
Don't fight it.

51:49.106 --> 51:50.232
Don't fear it.

51:52.443 --> 51:55.492
Allow yourself to be the manifestation

51:56.196 --> 52:00.793
of the monster that I know
lives inside your soul.

52:01.869 --> 52:03.212
(Footsteps approaching)

52:03.746 --> 52:05.419
Surviving this next period

52:05.497 --> 52:08.626
will push your mind further
than it's ever gone before.

52:10.878 --> 52:14.178
And that's when you need
to remember that this

52:14.256 --> 52:15.599
is a second chance.

52:19.303 --> 52:21.101
Take solace in that.

52:24.433 --> 52:25.480
(Gasping)

52:28.354 --> 52:29.526
Guards!

52:34.610 --> 52:35.907
- Bostok?
- (Sighs)

52:35.986 --> 52:37.203
- You did it!
- We gotta move.

52:38.405 --> 52:39.591
- (Sy) ls this everything?
- (Bostok) Yeah.

52:39.615 --> 52:41.413
- Where are the IDs?
- Here.

52:41.492 --> 52:43.586
- Got you a special one.
- Nurse?

52:43.661 --> 52:45.305
You don't want to know
what I did to get that.

52:45.329 --> 52:46.706
(Kreat) I opened the cells!

52:46.789 --> 52:48.211
(Cackling)

52:48.290 --> 52:51.214
- There were these other doors and... And...
- What?

52:51.293 --> 52:53.011
(Stuttering)

52:53.087 --> 52:54.885
(Gasping)

52:54.963 --> 52:56.180
- What?
- What?

52:58.425 --> 53:01.725
I let the devil loose.

53:02.805 --> 53:04.603
- (Growling)
- (Screaming)

53:09.395 --> 53:10.647
Guards! Report back.

53:10.771 --> 53:12.569
- (Growling)
- Go, go, go!

53:14.024 --> 53:16.152
(Men screaming)

53:17.194 --> 53:18.241
Go!

53:19.196 --> 53:20.743
(Growling)

53:21.740 --> 53:23.913
- (Growling)
- (Men screaming)

53:33.752 --> 53:36.152
(Bostok) You're telling me Vim's gonna
turn into one of them?

53:36.797 --> 53:39.346
(Kreat) All I know
is what I saw on the monitors.

53:40.134 --> 53:42.057
(Bostok) We've got to
get to Osiris before dark.

53:42.136 --> 53:43.479
Come on, let's go.

53:44.096 --> 53:45.473
I can't go with you guys.

53:47.307 --> 53:48.399
What?

53:49.977 --> 53:51.854
What are you talking about, man?

53:52.855 --> 53:54.198
We gotta stay together.

53:54.565 --> 53:56.192
(Growling)

53:58.444 --> 54:01.243
Easy. Easy, easy.

54:03.699 --> 54:04.916
Easy, boy.

54:04.992 --> 54:06.710
What you gonna do, huh?

54:08.036 --> 54:10.380
Where you gonna go, Sy?

54:11.331 --> 54:13.333
- I'm going to the opera.
- (Laughs)

54:13.709 --> 54:14.756
The what?

54:15.127 --> 54:18.802
No, baby Sy, you don't wanna go to
the opera. They sing at the opera.

54:19.214 --> 54:21.808
Don't you turn your back to me, Sy.

54:23.802 --> 54:24.894
(Sy) Good luck.

54:26.680 --> 54:28.273
Let him go. You and me.

54:29.933 --> 54:31.276
You're gonna die out there.

54:32.853 --> 54:34.105
(Growls)

54:34.188 --> 54:35.440
(Warden Mourdain) I made you.

54:36.356 --> 54:38.074
I made you.

54:38.358 --> 54:39.860
(Growling)

54:40.486 --> 54:41.533
- (Screams)
- (Growls)

54:42.446 --> 54:44.574
(Distant roaring)

54:47.826 --> 54:48.873
Bye, Vim.

54:48.952 --> 54:50.545
(Distant clamouring)

54:50.621 --> 54:51.793
Bye, Vim.

55:00.631 --> 55:01.803
(Helicopter blades whirring)

55:12.434 --> 55:15.278
<i>(Lamar) Normally you'd get 20 years
in a local secure max.</i>

55:16.897 --> 55:18.319
Maybe out in 15.

55:21.443 --> 55:22.911
But <i>I</i> highly doubt that.

55:26.740 --> 55:28.208
Despite

55:28.283 --> 55:30.377
all our best efforts

55:30.452 --> 55:32.546
they're going to paint
you as being a monster.

55:34.414 --> 55:36.712
They're gonna emphasize the breach of code,

55:37.501 --> 55:41.051
betrayal of trust that the public grants
to someone in your position.

55:42.673 --> 55:44.641
They're going to make
an example out of this.

55:44.716 --> 55:47.185
Eye for an eye, and all that.

55:49.137 --> 55:50.730
I wish I had better news.

55:52.641 --> 55:54.018
It doesn't matter.

55:55.644 --> 55:57.066
Nothing does any more.

56:04.987 --> 56:07.035
(Metal clinking)

56:23.088 --> 56:24.180
(Kane) Hey.

56:27.092 --> 56:28.264
These guys reliable?

56:30.429 --> 56:31.521
Nope.

56:34.182 --> 56:36.310
(Beeping)

56:46.778 --> 56:47.870
Who's paying?

56:48.906 --> 56:49.998
Me.

56:50.449 --> 56:53.043
(Hopper) Not too happy
about that Exor jacket.

56:53.118 --> 56:55.041
We don't much like your kind.

56:55.579 --> 56:56.671
How much?

57:09.885 --> 57:11.478
Mandel says no deal.

57:12.638 --> 57:13.685
Fuck.

57:18.268 --> 57:20.270
Well, how about you ask Mandel

57:20.729 --> 57:22.902
exactly what number's
gonna make him happy?

57:35.744 --> 57:36.996
Thirty Gs.

57:39.206 --> 57:40.253
(Gun cocks)

57:44.711 --> 57:46.008
Thirty's fair.

57:47.547 --> 57:48.719
Thirty. Deal.

57:48.799 --> 57:49.846
Deal.

57:52.135 --> 57:53.182
(Chuckles)

57:54.680 --> 57:55.727
(Beeps)

57:57.724 --> 57:58.771
(Chimes)

58:01.770 --> 58:04.319
May I ask where you're all headed
with this kind of hardware?

58:06.149 --> 58:07.366
Yeah, you can ask.

58:08.360 --> 58:09.862
I was just being polite!

58:09.945 --> 58:11.447
(Both laugh)

58:11.530 --> 58:12.656
(Kane) You got nice friends.

58:16.284 --> 58:19.413
- (Laughs)
- That was a really good transaction, man.

58:19.746 --> 58:21.669
<i>- Oh</i>

58:24.459 --> 58:26.302
We made some serious money!

58:26.378 --> 58:28.426
(Both laughing)

58:28.505 --> 58:30.428
Hey! Ow! Ow! Ow!

58:31.341 --> 58:33.514
<i>- (♪ Rock music)

58:43.979 --> 58:47.779

58:47.858 --> 58:52.534

58:55.490 --> 58:59.996

59:03.790 --> 59:05.292
Thirty Gs.

59:05.542 --> 59:07.590
(Chuckling)

59:11.256 --> 59:12.303
Hmm...

59:12.466 --> 59:13.843
(Whirring)

59:18.138 --> 59:19.981
(Distant roaring)

59:26.855 --> 59:27.902
(Hopper) Mandel!

59:30.442 --> 59:31.489
(Grunts)

59:33.570 --> 59:34.787
Get the hell over here!

59:36.281 --> 59:38.454
(Laughing)

59:38.533 --> 59:39.659
Come on.

59:39.743 --> 59:41.416
<i>♪ Sweet juice ♪</i>

59:41.495 --> 59:43.418
(Laughing)

59:43.497 --> 59:44.965
What is that?

59:45.207 --> 59:46.333
What's that?

59:51.129 --> 59:53.223
(Hopper) I swear I just saw something.

01:00:00.806 --> 01:00:02.979
(Door creaking)

01:00:27.624 --> 01:00:29.297
(Flies buzzing)

01:00:34.381 --> 01:00:36.258
(Metal creaking)

01:00:52.649 --> 01:00:54.322
(Growling)

01:01:02.742 --> 01:01:04.836
(Roaring)

01:01:12.419 --> 01:01:14.672
(All roaring)

01:01:20.093 --> 01:01:21.094
(Grunts)

01:01:25.015 --> 01:01:26.267
(Hopper) Check the back!

01:01:27.517 --> 01:01:29.190
(All roaring)

01:01:29.769 --> 01:01:30.861
(Breathing shakily)

01:01:31.104 --> 01:01:33.152
(Growling)

01:01:39.487 --> 01:01:40.613
They're everywhere!

01:01:41.698 --> 01:01:43.496
(Sniffing)

01:01:43.617 --> 01:01:45.119
(Hopper) Where are the shock rockets?

01:01:46.453 --> 01:01:47.670
You mean we sold them?

01:01:47.787 --> 01:01:49.835
(Growling)

01:01:49.956 --> 01:01:51.299
(Roaring)

01:01:51.333 --> 01:01:53.051
- (Screaming)
- (Machine guns firing)

01:01:57.464 --> 01:01:59.057
(Hopper) They're not going down!

01:02:00.467 --> 01:02:01.639
Reloading!

01:02:01.718 --> 01:02:03.311
(Screaming)

01:02:06.306 --> 01:02:07.523
Got one!

01:02:07.641 --> 01:02:09.143
Yeah!

01:02:12.896 --> 01:02:14.193
(Screaming)

01:02:14.314 --> 01:02:15.907
(Distant screaming)

01:02:15.982 --> 01:02:17.529
- (Gunfire)
- (Screaming)

01:02:19.653 --> 01:02:21.997
(Screaming)

01:02:22.072 --> 01:02:23.494
(Growls)

01:02:23.531 --> 01:02:25.249
- (Screaming)
- (Explodes)

01:02:34.834 --> 01:02:36.336
(Gyp) So, what you're saying is

01:02:37.587 --> 01:02:41.012
in less than 12 hours,
this whole place could be wiped.

01:02:43.843 --> 01:02:45.015
Every living thing.

01:02:51.434 --> 01:02:52.686
We'll all be dead.

01:03:03.196 --> 01:03:04.448
Yeah, that's right.

01:03:04.781 --> 01:03:06.842
(Bill) Throw in those damn monsters
you're describing,

01:03:06.866 --> 01:03:09.186
this place don't look anything
like it did in the brochure.

01:03:10.704 --> 01:03:12.877
(Sy) You ever wonder
how you end up where you do?

01:03:15.125 --> 01:03:16.422
You have all these plans...

01:03:18.628 --> 01:03:20.756
Make so many plans and yet...

01:03:22.090 --> 01:03:23.387
Here we are.

01:03:24.050 --> 01:03:26.724
No, not really. I know
exactly how I got here.

01:03:28.138 --> 01:03:30.061
Talking about fate, Sy?

01:03:31.474 --> 01:03:33.226
Talking about astrology and shit?

01:03:33.393 --> 01:03:34.485
I don't believe in fate.

01:03:35.395 --> 01:03:36.442
<i>Just consequence.</i>

01:03:36.563 --> 01:03:38.611
(Bill) Oh, that's right, square jaw.

01:03:39.065 --> 01:03:41.488
Live with no regrets. Can't ever go back.

01:03:41.735 --> 01:03:43.908
Hindsight's only to help you move forward.

01:03:44.321 --> 01:03:46.744
Well, I regret coming to
this shithole planet.

01:03:46.823 --> 01:03:47.915
(Chuckles)

01:03:49.576 --> 01:03:51.078
What's so funny about that?

01:03:51.411 --> 01:03:52.503
I love it here.

01:03:53.163 --> 01:03:56.167
That makes two of us,
my cherry pie with cream on top.

01:03:57.125 --> 01:03:59.127
Got wide open spaces, clean air.

01:03:59.419 --> 01:04:01.439
- Food that don't come from a laboratory now.
- Mmm.

01:04:01.463 --> 01:04:02.680
That's paradise.

01:04:02.756 --> 01:04:04.929
Momma used to say people don't change.

01:04:06.343 --> 01:04:08.141
Only their version of the past does.

01:04:10.472 --> 01:04:13.191
I say "Give a man a match,
he'll be warm for a minute.

01:04:13.266 --> 01:04:15.578
"Light him on fire,
he'll be warm for the rest of his life."

01:04:15.602 --> 01:04:16.603
Right.

01:04:16.686 --> 01:04:17.778
That's right.

01:04:19.356 --> 01:04:21.984
What about you, Abdominal?

01:04:22.108 --> 01:04:23.325
(Beeping)

01:04:23.443 --> 01:04:25.366
You dig this place? You dig the frontier?

01:04:27.155 --> 01:04:28.953
I liked it a lot better 24 hours ago.

01:04:29.282 --> 01:04:30.374
(Bill chuckling)

01:04:30.450 --> 01:04:32.373
But it's a fresh start and
that's what I needed.

01:04:35.789 --> 01:04:37.869
That, and I couldn't get
any further away from Earth.

01:04:40.335 --> 01:04:41.632
Bet they pay you well up there.

01:04:42.796 --> 01:04:44.469
In that... In that Sky fleet.

01:04:45.632 --> 01:04:46.804
Yeah, it pays okay.

01:04:48.802 --> 01:04:51.146
Mind you, for that career I...

01:04:51.554 --> 01:04:53.397
I got a failed marriage

01:04:53.473 --> 01:04:57.478
I got a shoulder that is never gonna heal,
and I got daughter that I hardly know.

01:04:58.728 --> 01:04:59.848
But yeah, the money's great.

01:05:02.190 --> 01:05:03.692
Well, our folks kicked us out.

01:05:03.817 --> 01:05:06.912
So, we had no choice
but to do something a little drastic.

01:05:07.654 --> 01:05:08.826
Your folks?

01:05:10.240 --> 01:05:11.492
You guys

01:05:11.574 --> 01:05:12.666
are related?

01:05:12.742 --> 01:05:13.868
That's right.

01:05:13.993 --> 01:05:15.495
She's my little stepsister.

01:05:16.079 --> 01:05:17.205
Mmm-hmm.

01:05:17.414 --> 01:05:19.007
That's why we don't look the same.

01:05:19.874 --> 01:05:21.592
(Gyp) That's why we don't kiss the same.

01:05:22.836 --> 01:05:24.930
Ooh, Sparky, that's turning you on.

01:05:26.172 --> 01:05:27.719
My little sugar Kane.

01:05:30.093 --> 01:05:31.515
What's your area up there?

01:05:32.011 --> 01:05:33.058
What do you mean?

01:05:33.179 --> 01:05:34.522
What do you do up there?

01:05:35.181 --> 01:05:37.183
I was in charge of infrastructure.

01:05:38.601 --> 01:05:40.854
Overseeing the growth
of the cities and surrounds.

01:05:41.855 --> 01:05:43.778
Everything. You know, like, uh,

01:05:43.857 --> 01:05:45.200
Capital,

01:05:45.233 --> 01:05:46.576
the mines, prison.

01:05:46.860 --> 01:05:48.703
You mean slave labour camps.

01:05:49.904 --> 01:05:52.908
Prison colonies changed
deep space exploration forever.

01:05:53.199 --> 01:05:57.124
The only way these frontiers grew so fast
is through mandatory labour.

01:05:58.121 --> 01:05:59.418
We wouldn't be here otherwise.

01:05:59.539 --> 01:06:01.883
That might be
a good talking point at one of your

01:06:01.958 --> 01:06:03.301
weekly meetings up there...

01:06:04.419 --> 01:06:05.887
But those prisoners,

01:06:06.880 --> 01:06:08.553
beyond what I personally thought of them,

01:06:09.591 --> 01:06:11.093
they came to me wrecked.

01:06:12.385 --> 01:06:15.059
Worked way beyond any humane point.

01:06:16.055 --> 01:06:18.774
We used to drive for the prison
when we first got here.

01:06:20.101 --> 01:06:21.899
What we saw was pretty bad.

01:06:22.896 --> 01:06:24.398
Least they're doing something useful.

01:06:25.315 --> 01:06:26.737
Prison's supposed to be hard.

01:06:27.817 --> 01:06:28.989
It's punishment, right?

01:06:30.904 --> 01:06:33.908
It's a big choice to turn your back
on everything you once stood for.

01:06:36.743 --> 01:06:37.995
You got a family, Sy?

01:06:39.579 --> 01:06:41.252
You got a family? You got kids?

01:06:45.168 --> 01:06:46.294
(Exhales)

01:06:47.420 --> 01:06:48.672
Then you wouldn't understand.

01:06:51.674 --> 01:06:52.971
(Bill) I gotta say it.

01:06:53.301 --> 01:06:55.520
Phew! What if your
daughter ain't there, huh?

01:06:57.597 --> 01:06:58.769
Huh?

01:06:59.265 --> 01:07:00.357
She'll be there.

01:07:01.935 --> 01:07:04.438
And then you take us to the bunker
and we'll be safe there?

01:07:04.521 --> 01:07:05.864
One hundred percent?

01:07:08.775 --> 01:07:10.027
Yeah, you have my word.

01:07:10.818 --> 01:07:12.695
Just as soon as my daughter is safe.

01:07:12.779 --> 01:07:13.951
Even if she ain't.

01:07:16.449 --> 01:07:17.792
Yeah, even if she ain't.

01:07:18.993 --> 01:07:21.121
Well, we gonna be one big happy family.

01:07:21.788 --> 01:07:22.880
I'm gonna be an uncle.

01:07:23.831 --> 01:07:25.299
It's gonna be fun. (Chuckles)

01:07:36.302 --> 01:07:38.475
(Sy) Hey, Bill, how long till Osiris?

01:07:38.555 --> 01:07:41.116
(Bill) Ah, it's probably gonna be
a couple more hours, square jaw.

01:07:41.140 --> 01:07:44.485
But don't worry, we got plenty of time
to shoot us some critters.

01:07:44.519 --> 01:07:47.648
No one messes with old Billy boy.
Gonna be fun!

01:07:50.233 --> 01:07:52.361
(Explosions)

01:07:58.324 --> 01:07:59.701
- (Growls)
- (Gasps)

01:07:59.826 --> 01:08:03.205
Holy shit! There's a huge
snapping turtle attacking Momma.

01:08:03.329 --> 01:08:04.581
(Growling)

01:08:05.206 --> 01:08:06.332
(Gunfire)

01:08:06.416 --> 01:08:07.508
(Crackling and hissing)

01:08:07.542 --> 01:08:08.759
(Gunfire)

01:08:08.918 --> 01:08:10.638
My apartment's right above us. Third floor.

01:08:11.337 --> 01:08:13.055
Damn, stop hitting my goddamn bus!

01:08:13.172 --> 01:08:15.234
Bill and Gyp, you protect Momma.
Sy, you come with me.

01:08:15.258 --> 01:08:16.350
(Bill) You gotta go!

01:08:17.510 --> 01:08:20.184
(Bill) All right boys! It's now or never.
Let's get going!

01:08:20.345 --> 01:08:21.438
Whoo-hoo!

01:08:22.223 --> 01:08:24.942
Hey, you know there's a chance
she's not up there or worse.

01:08:25.100 --> 01:08:27.220
If that happens, we're straight back here.
You got it?

01:08:27.937 --> 01:08:29.029
Yeah, I got it.

01:08:31.107 --> 01:08:32.529
Kane, I hope you find her.

01:08:32.734 --> 01:08:34.452
Go get your daughter, Abdominal.

01:08:34.527 --> 01:08:37.576
All right, we'll cover you.
Let's go, Gyp. Move!

01:08:38.197 --> 01:08:40.291
(Growling)

01:08:41.117 --> 01:08:42.868
- (Bill) Let's go, Gyp!
- Go, go, go!

01:08:42.952 --> 01:08:45.046
Get your asses out here, boys! Come on!

01:08:46.747 --> 01:08:48.375
(Gunfire)

01:08:48.457 --> 01:08:49.550
(Growling)

01:08:49.751 --> 01:08:50.877
Let's go!

01:08:55.381 --> 01:08:56.724
Get the door! Go!

01:08:58.718 --> 01:09:00.560
- (Grunts)
- Power's out. Use the stairs.

01:09:02.220 --> 01:09:03.894
(indistinct)

01:09:07.894 --> 01:09:09.237
- (Gunshot)
- (Screams)

01:09:09.812 --> 01:09:12.314
- (Man) You stay out of our stairwell.
- (Alarm blaring)

01:09:12.398 --> 01:09:13.819
Ozmin, is that you?

01:09:13.899 --> 01:09:15.072
(Ozmin) What?

01:09:15.151 --> 01:09:16.653
Ozmin, it's Kane from upstairs.

01:09:16.736 --> 01:09:18.238
How do I know that?

01:09:19.613 --> 01:09:22.457
Oh, it's Kane from 38!

01:09:22.575 --> 01:09:23.997
You seen Indi, or Rominja?

01:09:24.952 --> 01:09:26.578
Well, uh, I checked.

01:09:26.621 --> 01:09:29.670
There was no answer.
They haven't come through this way.

01:09:29.749 --> 01:09:32.093
Whole damned world's near gone mad.

01:09:32.126 --> 01:09:33.729
I have someone with me.
We're gonna come up, okay?

01:09:33.752 --> 01:09:35.426
Well, it's not my stairwell.

01:09:35.462 --> 01:09:36.930
You pay rent, too.

01:09:37.799 --> 01:09:38.970
(Kane) That's very kind.

01:09:39.509 --> 01:09:40.600
(Sy) Keep safe.

01:09:41.260 --> 01:09:42.352
And aim lower.

01:09:45.098 --> 01:09:46.145
Come on!

01:09:46.265 --> 01:09:48.313
- (Growls)
- Aha! Got you, little turtle!

01:09:48.434 --> 01:09:49.685
(Shrieks)

01:09:50.435 --> 01:09:51.483
(Laughs)

01:09:52.689 --> 01:09:53.781
Damn!

01:09:55.441 --> 01:09:57.034
Shit! (Grunts)

01:10:05.868 --> 01:10:06.960
(Kane) Indi!

01:10:07.787 --> 01:10:09.004
Stand back!

01:10:09.122 --> 01:10:10.123
(Gunshots)

01:10:12.458 --> 01:10:13.505
(Grunting)

01:10:15.128 --> 01:10:17.301
(Distant gunfire)

01:10:31.519 --> 01:10:32.566
Kane.

01:10:36.232 --> 01:10:37.324
(Indi) Dad?

01:10:40.027 --> 01:10:41.324
Dad, I'm here!

01:10:41.404 --> 01:10:43.247
- Dad, I'm here!
- Honey!

01:10:43.322 --> 01:10:44.744
(Gasping) I love you.

01:10:45.158 --> 01:10:47.661
- (Indi sobbing)
- You OK?

01:10:47.744 --> 01:10:50.139
Rominja told me to hide in there
and not come out until you came.

01:10:50.163 --> 01:10:51.380
Oh, honey.

01:10:51.664 --> 01:10:52.836
Where's Rominja?

01:10:53.166 --> 01:10:54.213
Uh...

01:10:55.501 --> 01:10:56.593
She's gone home.

01:10:57.170 --> 01:10:58.763
- She's not here.
- OK.

01:10:58.838 --> 01:11:00.181
(Indi sobs)

01:11:00.882 --> 01:11:02.008
Kane, we gotta go.

01:11:02.049 --> 01:11:03.517
- Yeah.
- Who's that?

01:11:03.593 --> 01:11:06.437
(Kane) That's our friend, Sy.
He's a good man. He's gonna help us.

01:11:06.512 --> 01:11:07.764
But you have to come with us.

01:11:07.847 --> 01:11:09.690
You need to stay right next to me, OK?

01:11:09.766 --> 01:11:11.860
And we're gonna be fine
but we have to run now.

01:11:12.602 --> 01:11:13.728
(Sobbing)

01:11:13.853 --> 01:11:15.696
- (Growling)
- Kane!

01:11:17.398 --> 01:11:19.526
We gotta go. Go, go, go! Come on!

01:11:21.068 --> 01:11:22.365
(Ozmin shouting)

01:11:22.445 --> 01:11:23.788
(Indi) What is that?

01:11:23.863 --> 01:11:24.910
(Growling)

01:11:26.616 --> 01:11:27.708
(Gunfire)

01:11:28.201 --> 01:11:29.293
Move, move!

01:11:29.786 --> 01:11:31.914
(Gyp sobbing)

01:11:37.585 --> 01:11:38.962
(Door opens)

01:11:49.055 --> 01:11:51.057
(Gyp) Bill, where do we keep the meds?

01:11:51.808 --> 01:11:53.105
(Sobbing)

01:12:00.566 --> 01:12:02.409
No! No, no, no!

01:12:03.945 --> 01:12:05.288
(Sobbing)

01:12:05.404 --> 01:12:07.122
(Grunting)

01:12:07.824 --> 01:12:09.576
(crying)

01:12:53.619 --> 01:12:54.666
Go, go, go!

01:12:55.454 --> 01:12:57.766
(Indi) Dad, Dad, where are we going?
There's nowhere to go!

01:12:57.790 --> 01:12:58.962
- Now what?
- (Gunfire)

01:12:59.041 --> 01:13:00.964
I don't know. Let me think. Indi!

01:13:01.002 --> 01:13:02.128
Indi!

01:13:02.295 --> 01:13:04.013
- (Growls)
- (Thuds on door)

01:13:04.130 --> 01:13:05.222
'Dad!
'(Growling)

01:13:05.298 --> 01:13:07.141
Dad, there's a bus down there!

01:13:07.174 --> 01:13:08.642
We can make it.

01:13:09.635 --> 01:13:10.727
Gotta jump.

01:13:11.012 --> 01:13:12.059
Hey!

01:13:12.138 --> 01:13:14.140
- Come here.
- No! No, it's too high! Sy!

01:13:14.223 --> 01:13:15.566
- (Indi screams)
- Sy!

01:13:18.311 --> 01:13:19.358
(Grunts)

01:13:23.065 --> 01:13:24.237
(Yells)

01:13:24.483 --> 01:13:25.826
(Grunts)

01:13:25.860 --> 01:13:27.362
- Give me your hand.
- (Yells)

01:13:27.486 --> 01:13:28.658
(Sy) Kane, come here.

01:13:34.035 --> 01:13:35.161
(Grunting)

01:13:35.828 --> 01:13:37.748
Indi, come here.
Come here, come here, come here.

01:13:38.414 --> 01:13:40.142
- Stay down, stay down, stay down.
- Bill! Gyp!

01:13:40.166 --> 01:13:41.668
- (Banging)
- Open the hatch!

01:13:41.834 --> 01:13:43.006
Open it!

01:13:45.004 --> 01:13:46.426
(whimpering)

01:13:47.006 --> 01:13:48.849
"(Growling) 'Open it!

01:13:49.091 --> 01:13:50.559
Open the door!

01:13:51.010 --> 01:13:52.387
- (Indi shrieks)
- (Sy) Open it!

01:13:53.346 --> 01:13:54.518
Open the hatch!

01:13:54.889 --> 01:13:56.186
(Beeping)

01:13:58.684 --> 01:13:59.776
(Kane) Come on. Come on.

01:14:00.019 --> 01:14:01.111
- Get her.
- Got her.

01:14:01.187 --> 01:14:02.359
(Kane) Grab her. Take her!

01:14:02.438 --> 01:14:03.735
(Sy) Got her! (Grunts)

01:14:03.856 --> 01:14:05.278
Got her. Stay here.

01:14:06.400 --> 01:14:07.902
All right, I'm in! Let's go!

01:14:08.277 --> 01:14:09.574
You okay? You okay?

01:14:09.695 --> 01:14:11.868
- Let's go! Stay down.
- (Indi sobbing)

01:14:12.406 --> 01:14:13.532
Drive!

01:14:17.119 --> 01:14:18.245
Gyp!

01:14:18.788 --> 01:14:20.415
Gyp, we've gotta move now!

01:14:21.040 --> 01:14:22.587
(Engine starting)

01:14:53.072 --> 01:14:54.883
(Kane) You understand
everything I've just told you

01:14:54.907 --> 01:14:57.251
about the creatures,
about the people I worked for.

01:14:57.410 --> 01:14:59.333
About everything that's
happening out there.

01:14:59.829 --> 01:15:01.752
This is important to me.

01:15:02.248 --> 01:15:04.250
I do, Dad. I understand.

01:15:07.086 --> 01:15:10.010
I'm sorry for being the crappiest,

01:15:11.090 --> 01:15:12.433
crappiest father.

01:15:14.427 --> 01:15:16.771
And I'm sorry that things
didn't work out with your mother.

01:15:17.972 --> 01:15:19.269
I loved her.

01:15:20.433 --> 01:15:22.026
I loved her so much. I still love her.

01:15:23.769 --> 01:15:26.192
And I'm sorry that
I wasn't there for you growing up.

01:15:27.023 --> 01:15:29.776
And I'm sorry that I didn't get
to come to your games.

01:15:30.276 --> 01:15:31.778
Your softball games,

01:15:32.611 --> 01:15:35.285
and your soccer games
and your singing practice.

01:15:36.615 --> 01:15:37.707
It's OK.

01:15:37.783 --> 01:15:40.502
I'm so sorry I never came
to any of that, because I think

01:15:41.454 --> 01:15:42.797
you are amazing.

01:15:47.126 --> 01:15:48.378
(Sniffling)

01:15:48.461 --> 01:15:50.213
I need to know you forgive me.

01:15:50.963 --> 01:15:52.681
(Whimpering) Of course.

01:15:53.132 --> 01:15:54.384
(Signs)

01:15:55.134 --> 01:15:57.307
If we get through this,
it's gonna be different.

01:15:58.804 --> 01:16:00.681
I promise you, it's gonna be different.

01:16:02.808 --> 01:16:05.027
(Breathing heavily)

01:16:26.332 --> 01:16:29.006
(Kane) Gyp, about a mile up the road,
we're gonna take a right.

01:16:29.168 --> 01:16:31.421
The bunker's in an old
abandoned mine shaft.

01:16:32.004 --> 01:16:34.257
And stay alert.
Those creatures could be anywhere.

01:16:35.674 --> 01:16:38.598
There's a code on the door. It is 14286.

01:16:39.220 --> 01:16:41.723
- Sy, you get that?
- 14286.

01:16:41.847 --> 01:16:43.520
- Gyp?
- Got it.

01:16:43.599 --> 01:16:46.193
- Say it.
- 14286!

01:16:48.354 --> 01:16:50.027
14286. Got it.

01:16:50.189 --> 01:16:51.782
14286.

01:16:57.238 --> 01:17:00.242
<i>(Computer on PA) Protocol 84. Commencing.</i>

01:17:02.201 --> 01:17:06.251
<i>General, scanners indicate there is a bus
headed for Apex Ridge bunker.</i>

01:17:12.920 --> 01:17:15.264
(Beeping)

01:17:18.592 --> 01:17:20.390
(Whooshing)

01:17:30.604 --> 01:17:31.730
Dad.

01:17:36.443 --> 01:17:38.741
Sy! Company, three o'clock.

01:17:38.779 --> 01:17:41.060
- Stay down here, OK? Just stay there.
- What's happening?

01:17:43.075 --> 01:17:45.874
- What's it doing?
- It's watching us to see where we're headed.

01:17:47.121 --> 01:17:49.419
Gyp, keep going straight.
Don't take the turn.

01:17:49.623 --> 01:17:52.303
- (Sy) We don't have time for that.
- (Kane) We don't have a choice.

01:17:54.420 --> 01:17:56.263
But, Dad... Dad, what's happening?

01:17:56.297 --> 01:17:58.220
Indi, stay down, please!

01:17:58.591 --> 01:18:01.069
That thing needs at least four minutes
to get to a safe distance.

01:18:01.093 --> 01:18:02.613
It's too small to withstand the blast.

01:18:04.597 --> 01:18:06.065
When it leaves, we turn back.

01:18:06.307 --> 01:18:07.433
How much time have we got?

01:18:07.933 --> 01:18:09.276
Four fifteen.

01:18:09.310 --> 01:18:10.607
<i>Four fifteen'?</i>

01:18:10.811 --> 01:18:11.937
That's pushing it.

01:18:12.062 --> 01:18:13.314
What if it doesn't leave?

01:18:14.273 --> 01:18:16.073
Then we've got nothing
to worry about, right?

01:18:21.071 --> 01:18:23.915
- Dad!
- Stay down, OK? Listen to me.

01:18:23.949 --> 01:18:25.451
Wrap yourself up.

01:18:25.492 --> 01:18:28.291
Be like a ball, okay? A very small ball.

01:18:28.329 --> 01:18:30.081
Stay as low as you can, you understand?

01:18:31.582 --> 01:18:32.754
How's your daughter?

01:18:33.125 --> 01:18:34.297
She's scared.

01:18:38.130 --> 01:18:40.007
(Kane) Sy, where is it? Can you see it?

01:18:40.507 --> 01:18:41.679
It's going over us.

01:18:44.637 --> 01:18:46.264
- It's leaving.
- Turn!

01:18:49.308 --> 01:18:50.651
(Indi shrieks)

01:18:56.815 --> 01:18:57.941
Indi, you OK?

01:18:57.983 --> 01:18:59.109
Yeah.

01:19:00.819 --> 01:19:02.036
Go. Turn.

01:19:06.825 --> 01:19:09.305
You line it up with that mountain peak
and give her everything.

01:19:12.289 --> 01:19:13.791
Are we gonna make it?

01:19:14.541 --> 01:19:16.134
We're gonna try.

01:19:19.171 --> 01:19:20.388
(Sy) Almost there!

01:19:20.839 --> 01:19:21.965
I see the junkyard!

01:19:22.007 --> 01:19:24.055
- (Kane) Remember the way to the bunker?
- Uh-huh.

01:19:24.176 --> 01:19:26.349
(Kane) Stay down here
and when we get there, you run.

01:19:28.305 --> 01:19:29.352
(Sy) Kane!

01:19:31.558 --> 01:19:32.684
Kane!

01:19:35.020 --> 01:19:36.488
(Tyres screeching)

01:19:36.855 --> 01:19:38.528
(Guns clicking)

01:19:39.149 --> 01:19:40.696
- Dive!

<i>(Indi) There was no goodbye.</i>

01:21:20.626 --> 01:21:22.299
<i>No final words.</i>

01:21:25.297 --> 01:21:29.143
<i>And I knew the moment I
stepped off that bus</i>

01:21:29.468 --> 01:21:31.846
<i>I would never see his face again.</i>

01:21:35.974 --> 01:21:37.146
(Indi) My Dad!

01:21:37.184 --> 01:21:38.310
Stay with me, Indi.

01:21:38.352 --> 01:21:39.820
(Sobbing)

01:21:41.146 --> 01:21:43.444
- I want my Dad!
- I know.

01:21:48.320 --> 01:21:49.867
<i>(Indi) I didn't want to leave him.</i>

01:21:51.490 --> 01:21:55.836
<i>And yet, a convicted murderer
serving life would not allow it.</i>

01:21:57.162 --> 01:22:01.133

was now pushing him forward</i>

They're here!

01:22:08.715 --> 01:22:09.841
Go, Indi!

01:22:09.967 --> 01:22:11.014
Go!

01:22:12.302 --> 01:22:14.555
<i>(Indi) But no matter how far you run...</i>

01:22:16.807 --> 01:22:17.854
This way!

01:22:19.351 --> 01:22:20.978
<i>Or how well you hide...</i>

01:22:21.019 --> 01:22:22.191
- Which way?
- That way!

01:22:24.022 --> 01:22:26.195
<i>(Indi) You can't escape destiny.</i>

01:22:27.317 --> 01:22:28.819

01:22:34.533 --> 01:22:36.035
(Gasps)

01:22:36.535 --> 01:22:38.082
(Roaring)

01:22:38.745 --> 01:22:40.747
Go! Go! Go! Go!

01:22:41.498 --> 01:22:42.670
Hurry, Indi!

01:22:43.167 --> 01:22:44.544
14286, Indi.

01:22:44.668 --> 01:22:45.760
<i>I got it!</i>

01:22:46.086 --> 01:22:47.212
(Groans)

01:22:47.379 --> 01:22:49.006
Six! Come on! Come on!

01:22:49.590 --> 01:22:50.716
Go, Indi!

01:22:50.841 --> 01:22:52.514
(Roars echoing)

01:22:54.094 --> 01:22:56.062
(Grunting)

01:22:58.390 --> 01:23:00.734
<i>(Computer on PA) Plutonium core exposed.</i>

<i>Meltdown commencing.</i>

01:23:08.901 --> 01:23:10.699
(Powering up)

01:23:11.361 --> 01:23:12.408
Ten...

We're out of time! Come on!

01:23:22.789 --> 01:23:24.257
One.

01:23:29.880 --> 01:23:32.053
- (Rumbling)
- (Groaning, coughing)

01:23:33.425 --> 01:23:34.597
Sy!

01:23:40.432 --> 01:23:42.901
Sy, what's happening to you?

01:23:42.935 --> 01:23:45.779
(Slurring) I'm becoming one of them, Indi.

01:23:46.438 --> 01:23:47.735
What do I do?

01:23:48.065 --> 01:23:49.567
You're not safe with me here.

01:23:49.942 --> 01:23:51.285
Tell me, what do I do?

01:23:51.443 --> 01:23:52.569
(Yells)

01:23:52.611 --> 01:23:53.783
Tell me!

01:23:53.820 --> 01:23:56.073
Find... Find me something sharp.

01:24:00.160 --> 01:24:01.628
Hurry! Scissors...

01:24:03.121 --> 01:24:04.498
Bring it to me.

01:24:06.124 --> 01:24:07.842
Yes. Yes! Yes!

01:24:07.960 --> 01:24:09.400
What are you going to do with these?

01:24:09.503 --> 01:24:11.301
You're not safe with me here.

01:24:12.631 --> 01:24:14.349
Bring 'em here! Come on.

01:24:14.675 --> 01:24:15.972
(Gasping)

01:24:18.428 --> 01:24:19.520
No!

01:24:21.807 --> 01:24:23.775
I can't do this by myself.

01:24:25.018 --> 01:24:26.520
I need you to help me.

01:24:27.980 --> 01:24:29.778
I need you to help me. Come on.

01:24:30.482 --> 01:24:32.280
No, I can't. No.

01:24:32.317 --> 01:24:34.285
You're gonna protect me,
just like Dad said.

01:24:34.319 --> 01:24:35.491
No!

01:24:35.529 --> 01:24:38.328
I can't do this on my own!

01:24:40.158 --> 01:24:41.284
Sy!

01:24:41.326 --> 01:24:43.124
You're all I've got!

01:24:44.329 --> 01:24:45.501
No!

01:24:47.040 --> 01:24:48.633
(Screaming)

01:24:55.340 --> 01:24:56.637
(Woman) Charlton Hospital.

01:24:57.175 --> 01:24:58.472
Directing you now.

01:25:00.721 --> 01:25:01.973
<i>(Antonio) Nurse Lombrok.</i>

01:25:02.222 --> 01:25:04.691
<i>What'd you do wrong
to get back on this shift?</i>

01:25:05.684 --> 01:25:06.731
How're you feeling?

01:25:08.895 --> 01:25:10.897
Right now, there's people in that bar

01:25:11.189 --> 01:25:12.907
enjoying a nice single malt.

01:25:13.317 --> 01:25:15.411
I'm wondering why the hell
I'm not one of them.

01:25:17.988 --> 01:25:19.410
- Incoming?
- Two vehicle collision.

01:25:19.531 --> 01:25:21.204
- Three persons involved.
- ETA?

01:25:21.241 --> 01:25:22.413
Right now.

01:25:22.826 --> 01:25:24.203
How was the opera tonight?

01:25:24.578 --> 01:25:26.501
- First time you've been, right?
- Mmm-hmm.

01:25:26.580 --> 01:25:28.002
It's so over the top.

01:25:28.373 --> 01:25:30.613
This is the mother of a young girl
who died at the scene.

01:25:30.709 --> 01:25:33.758
Incoming is a 24-year-old male
who caused the accident.

01:25:33.879 --> 01:25:36.348
He's highly intoxicated,
but in stable condition.

01:25:36.381 --> 01:25:37.849
Going to theatre one!

01:25:38.759 --> 01:25:39.885
(Sy) Kiara,

01:25:40.344 --> 01:25:41.721
Kai, they loved it.

01:25:42.095 --> 01:25:43.847
They really loved it.

01:25:44.598 --> 01:25:45.895
It was nice.

01:25:47.225 --> 01:25:49.193
That's what family time's all about.

01:25:49.853 --> 01:25:51.571
Well, do it while you can.

01:25:51.897 --> 01:25:54.195
(Distant sirens)

01:26:04.785 --> 01:26:07.208
- Blood pressure being taken.
- (Nurse) Immediate casualties.

01:26:07.245 --> 01:26:08.389
Suspected pelvic,
abdominal and pelvic trauma.

01:26:08.413 --> 01:26:09.585
It's gonna be...

01:26:16.421 --> 01:26:17.593
Kiara...

01:26:17.714 --> 01:26:19.874
(Nurse 2) She's haemorrhaging.
Call the surgeon's team.

01:26:21.093 --> 01:26:22.265
Kiara.

01:26:22.386 --> 01:26:23.433
(Beeping)

01:26:24.096 --> 01:26:25.448
(Nurse 3) We have a situation here.

01:26:25.472 --> 01:26:27.033
(Dr Curruthers) Nurse Lombrok,
please leave the room.

01:26:27.057 --> 01:26:29.606
Stay with me. Stay with me.
Baby, stay... Stay with us.

01:26:29.643 --> 01:26:30.769
Stay with us.

01:26:31.395 --> 01:26:33.489
It's my wife. Can you hear me?

01:26:33.605 --> 01:26:36.626
(Dr Curruthers) We will do everything we
can to save her, but you can't be here.

01:26:36.650 --> 01:26:38.948
- (Jandi) Sy...
- (Sy) Keep breathing. Keep breathing.

01:26:39.069 --> 01:26:40.412
(Jandi) You have to come with me.

01:26:40.570 --> 01:26:43.915
(Whimpering) I love you.
I love you so much.

01:26:45.242 --> 01:26:46.334
I love you.

01:26:46.493 --> 01:26:47.804
(Dr Curruthers)
We have some haemorrhaging here.

01:26:47.828 --> 01:26:49.421
- Sy, you have to go.
- (Gasps)

01:26:49.454 --> 01:26:51.307
If you can hear me, sweetheart,
squeeze my hand.

01:26:51.331 --> 01:26:52.503
Squeeze his hand.

01:26:53.333 --> 01:26:54.459
Please, honey.

01:26:57.796 --> 01:27:00.116
- (Dr Curruthers) We're losing her.
- (EKG beeping rapidly)

01:27:02.801 --> 01:27:04.849
Where's my daughter? Where...

01:27:05.804 --> 01:27:07.147
ls she the one that...

01:27:08.306 --> 01:27:10.434
ls she the fatality, too?

01:27:12.144 --> 01:27:14.488
- I'm so sorry...
- Where's my daughter, Jandi?

01:27:14.688 --> 01:27:15.814
Where's Kai?

01:27:15.856 --> 01:27:17.216
Where's my baby girl? Where's Kai?

01:27:17.315 --> 01:27:18.817
I'm so sorry.

01:27:21.194 --> 01:27:23.117
Let me go get someone to talk to you.

01:27:27.033 --> 01:27:29.456
(Beeping)

01:27:31.163 --> 01:27:32.665
(Gasps) No.

01:27:32.789 --> 01:27:34.883
(Dr Curruthers) Asystole! Commencing CPR!

01:27:37.669 --> 01:27:38.841
On, baby.

01:27:52.517 --> 01:27:54.565
<i>They're gonna make an example out of this.</i>

01:27:55.020 --> 01:27:56.363
Eye for an eye,

01:27:57.314 --> 01:27:58.406
and all that.

01:28:03.737 --> 01:28:05.330
- (Thuds)
- (Grunting)

01:28:17.918 --> 01:28:19.716
- (Taser Zapping)
- (Groans)

01:28:33.892 --> 01:28:37.066
(Indi) <i>My father always said
that you could never trust a person</i>

01:28:37.187 --> 01:28:39.406
<i>that needed something from you.</i>

01:28:40.565 --> 01:28:43.409
<i>But he also said he'd never met anyone</i>

01:28:43.735 --> 01:28:45.362
<i>who didn't need something</i>

01:28:45.737 --> 01:28:47.080
<i>from someone.</i>

01:28:48.740 --> 01:28:51.414
<i>I say we are what we are</i>

01:28:53.245 --> 01:28:54.588
when we need to be.

01:28:54.704 --> 01:28:57.082
(Man) Well, there's the beacon.

01:29:03.421 --> 01:29:04.798
Do you recognize that?

01:29:05.465 --> 01:29:07.263
(Woman) Looks like an old model.

01:29:18.728 --> 01:29:20.401
(Man) Must have been manually activated.

01:29:21.481 --> 01:29:23.074
There's gotta be someone here.

01:29:23.733 --> 01:29:25.920
(Woman) That means we're gonna
have to do this the hard way.

01:29:25.944 --> 01:29:28.618
(Man) Well, there's a bunker close by.
Let's start there.

01:29:28.905 --> 01:29:31.909
- (Woman) I'm going to go and get the kit.
- (Man) Yeah, okay.

01:29:32.993 --> 01:29:34.119
(Woman) Whitmore.

01:29:34.578 --> 01:29:35.795
(Whitmore) Yeah?

01:29:39.791 --> 01:29:41.418
It's a kid.

01:29:42.127 --> 01:29:44.425
(Woman) Stay there. We'll come and get you.

01:29:44.796 --> 01:29:46.798
- (Thuds)
- (Groaning)

01:29:48.633 --> 01:29:49.634
(Growling)

01:29:52.137 --> 01:29:53.980
(Roaring)

01:30:05.942 --> 01:30:06.989
(Taps on helmet)

01:30:21.875 --> 01:30:23.468
There was a large ship.

01:30:23.877 --> 01:30:25.129
The Flotilla.

01:30:25.545 --> 01:30:27.343
It used to orbit here.

01:30:27.547 --> 01:30:28.890
Where has it gone?

01:30:29.633 --> 01:30:33.137
It's en route to Earth.

01:30:33.178 --> 01:30:36.182
It was recalled after the disaster.

01:30:36.723 --> 01:30:39.021
Tell me what they said happened here.

01:30:39.976 --> 01:30:41.978
(whimpering)

01:30:43.188 --> 01:30:45.691
They... They just said that

01:30:48.151 --> 01:30:52.657
the prisoners revolted
and they sabotaged the reactors.

01:30:54.866 --> 01:30:56.539
There was a meltdown.

01:30:58.411 --> 01:31:00.505
How many survivors were there?

01:31:01.873 --> 01:31:03.170
None.

01:31:04.334 --> 01:31:06.086
At least, that's what we thought.

01:31:08.922 --> 01:31:10.720
Do you want to die out here?

01:31:12.342 --> 01:31:14.891
I don't wanna... I don't wanna die.

01:31:15.887 --> 01:31:18.390
Then you will take us to the Flotilla.

01:31:18.431 --> 01:31:22.061
You will ensure that we
enter undetected, or...

01:31:22.769 --> 01:31:25.067
It will cost you your life.

01:31:25.355 --> 01:31:26.732
(Growls)

01:31:29.901 --> 01:31:31.073
All right.

01:31:31.903 --> 01:31:33.029
OK.

01:32:28.626 --> 01:32:30.128
(Engine starting)

01:32:39.095 --> 01:32:40.142
Sy.

01:32:41.473 --> 01:32:42.850
We're going home.

01:32:55.320 --> 01:32:56.663
Goodbye, Dad.
