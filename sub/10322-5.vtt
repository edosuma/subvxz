My name is Earl.

00:04.004 --> 00:07.708
[ Earl Narrating ]
Some things are so amazing, you
have to capture 'em on film.

00:07.775 --> 00:09.710
Like U.F.O.s or bigfoot.

00:09.777 --> 00:12.012
[ Shutter Clicks ]

00:12.080 --> 00:13.981
Cherry, bucket.

00:14.048 --> 00:16.584
[ Earl Narrating ]
Joy had recently gotten
in trouble with the law,

00:16.650 --> 00:18.819
and her deaf lawyer
thought it might help
sway a jury...

00:18.886 --> 00:21.822
if she could prove
that she was a givin'
member of society.

00:21.889 --> 00:23.891
Hey, Earl,
get this on film.

00:23.957 --> 00:26.260
I'm gettin' ready to hug one
of these old coots in a second.

[ Man ]
Hey, is that Earl Hickey?

00:29.697 --> 00:32.100
[ Earl Narrating ]
I recognized that voice
as soon as I heard it.

00:32.166 --> 00:34.902
It was Tom Sparks.
Number 50 on my list--

00:34.968 --> 00:37.405
kicked the lead singer
out of my band.

00:37.471 --> 00:40.708
Sometimes great things
just happen by accident.

00:40.774 --> 00:44.312
Like the way peanut butter
and chocolate came together.
Or Mount Rushmore.

00:44.378 --> 00:46.914
Or how we started our band.

[ Earl Narrating ]
The lead singer's the most
important person in a band.

02:03.591 --> 02:06.294
The Stones have Jagger,
The Who have Daltrey,

02:06.360 --> 02:11.332

who looked older than
both of 'em put together.

Hey, it's my band!
Here, let me get my glasses
to get a good look at you.

02:18.372 --> 02:20.341
[ Earl Narrating ]
After a couple of rehearsals,

02:20.408 --> 02:22.676
we booked a gig
at the Crab Shack
for 20 bucks each,

02:22.743 --> 02:25.145
but we weren't doin' it
for the money.

02:26.113 --> 02:28.216
Hey, ladies.
We're rock stars.

02:28.282 --> 02:30.150
You can tell from
our rock star pants.

02:30.218 --> 02:32.853
See all the zippers?
Guess what's in that zipper.

02:34.655 --> 02:37.591
- Licorice.
- Maybe I'll see what's
in the other zippers.

02:37.658 --> 02:40.093
- More licorice.

02:52.706 --> 02:55.876
Ew! If I wanted to
get hit on by an old guy,
I'd move back home.

02:55.943 --> 02:58.446
Let's go.

03:00.614 --> 03:02.416
[ Earl Narrating ]
The fact that Tom was
scarin' away the chicks...

03:02.483 --> 03:04.485
was a bit unpopular
with the guys.

03:04.552 --> 03:07.521
All in favor of kickin'
the old guy out of the band.

03:10.057 --> 03:15.195
Now all in favor of keepin'
the old guy who's creepin'
out all the chicks, man.

03:17.698 --> 03:21.201
- Sorry, Tom, you're out.
- Oh, yeah?

03:21.269 --> 03:24.438
Well, maybe
the three of you are out.
Did you ever think about that?

03:24.505 --> 03:28.909
Hey, man, whatever makes you
feel better about leavin' as
fast as possible, all right?

03:28.976 --> 03:31.345
- Fine.
- [ Earl Narrating ]
It was tough.

03:31.412 --> 03:35.015
But Ralph was right.
Tom was holdin' us back.

Could one of you guys give me
a ride home? I'm not allowed
to drive after sunset.

So in keeping with
true rock star fashion,
after the show,

03:55.969 --> 04:00.040
we took the chicks
back to Ralph's mom's house
and partied in our underwear.

After explaining my list to Tom,

04:12.420 --> 04:16.690
I apologized and offered him
the 20 bucks he would have made
from the gig.

04:16.757 --> 04:19.627
Don't want your 20 bucks.
Want to be back in the band.

04:19.693 --> 04:22.496
Sorry to tell you, Tom,
but there is no band.

04:22.563 --> 04:27.335
We played one gig, got drunk,
got laid and sold our
instruments to get more beer.

04:27.401 --> 04:29.269
Well, at least you had
the one night.

04:29.337 --> 04:33.607
You got to experience
the thrill of the show.
The party with the chicks.

04:33.674 --> 04:38.111
See, everybody in here's got,
you know, one great memory
they can look back on.

04:38.178 --> 04:41.349
You know, like, how
they climbed a mountain.
How they fought in a war.

04:41.415 --> 04:44.985
I once tongue kissed
a Jamaican woman.

04:45.052 --> 04:47.488
See?
Everybody's got somethin'.

04:47.555 --> 04:49.623
What do I got?
Nothin'.

04:49.690 --> 04:53.093
You took away my one shot
at bein' a-- a rock star.

04:53.160 --> 04:55.563
You know what, Tom?

04:55.629 --> 05:00.768
I don't think I can make you
a rock star, but I can sure
give you one hell of a memory.

05:00.834 --> 05:03.070
I think it's time to get
the band back together.

05:03.136 --> 05:05.706

After rentin' some
second-hand instruments...

05:05.773 --> 05:08.876
and explaining my situation
to the guys, everybody agreed.

05:08.942 --> 05:12.380
It was time for Phish Tahko
to feed its fans once again.

All right, guys, remember,
when one of us stops playin',
we all stop playin',

05:15.449 --> 05:17.284
'cause that means
the song's over.

05:17.351 --> 05:19.820

that means the next song's
startin'.

in here.

you out of the band before,

05:25.859 --> 05:28.762
It's cool.
No, man.
I was young and immature,

05:28.829 --> 05:31.031

have much of a father figure,

05:31.098 --> 05:33.734

his extra energy.

discuss with another man,

I slept with your dad."

I'm really sorry you had to
find out that way.

even before I started my list.
I feel awful.

between us, given that we're

didn't touch me with the same
hand that defiled my mother.

gotta be another way, man.

he would listen to.

It is why my brother
killed my father.
Do you have to leave town?

Why don't we just kill Ralph?
That'd keep him from
killin' you.

That's no good.
Then his spirit will
haunt your dreams.

you get to haunt his dreams,
so you win.

if I want to win like that.

I figured I better get out of
town until Ralph calmed down.

take till forever,

And that's how I got married
to Ralph's mom.

So me and Ralph's mom

I guess you wouldn't call it
a shotgun wedding.

[ Earl Narrating ]
Gettin' suddenly married
to your best friend's mom...

13:48.661 --> 13:51.464
so he won't kill you
can have an unsettling effect.

[ Earl Narrating ]
Just like that,
I was a family man again.

14:37.577 --> 14:40.380
So far, this marriage was better
than my last one.

14:40.447 --> 14:44.484
My wife cooked,
and at least one of my kids
was a blood relation to me.

14:52.692 --> 14:56.163
And compared to all the sirens
and the loud hooker fights
at the motel,

14:56.229 --> 14:58.398
livin' here was peaceful
and homey.

14:58.465 --> 15:01.634
And we actually
spent time together
like a real family.

15:08.641 --> 15:12.379
And I found it was easier
puttin' these boys to bed
than my last two.

15:12.445 --> 15:16.783
Mainly 'cause these boys
drank themselves to sleep
before story time.

15:16.849 --> 15:21.188
And I know it might sound crazy,
but as far as
forced marriages go,

15:21.254 --> 15:23.490
this one was turnin' out
pretty nice.

15:23.556 --> 15:27.194
I guess bein' married to
Ralph's mom was somethin'
I could get used to.

15:27.260 --> 15:29.997
And at least I could have
if not for one thing.

15:30.063 --> 15:34.334

who expected me to fulfill
my husbandly duties.

And every night that week,
after the boys went to bed,

to avoid my husbandly duties.

The worst part of

19:23.563 --> 19:25.865
was that it
sobered me up a little.

So after the annulment,
her and Tom continued
