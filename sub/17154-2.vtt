-Yeah.

-Nobody told me.
-You should know.

for their anniversary tomorrow?"

"Oh, no, I totally forgot.

And then I say to him, "Psych!"

"Not cool."

OK, stop.
I'm caught up.

It's Dad's birthday. Duh!

-Guys, check this out.

Do you guys think your mom
will like this for her birthday?

Besides, that's the ugliest
sweater I've ever seen.

01:29.000 --> 01:31.709
You would never buy that for our mom.
Look at it.

01:31.917 --> 01:33.917
OK, fine.
You win.

01:34.000 --> 01:36.750
I would never get her that.
What I really got her

10:25.458 --> 10:27.875
That's not a bowl!
That's a colander.

10:27.959 --> 10:30.250
-What's a colander?
-Something only you guys

10:30.333 --> 10:31.875
would call a mysterious
bottomless bowl.

10:31.959 --> 10:34.125
A colander has holes in the bottom.

10:35.333 --> 10:37.375
-Uh-oh.
-[Joe] Oh... whoa.

10:39.750 --> 10:41.709
We need... we need towels! Hurry!

10:46.458 --> 10:47.750
What is that smell?

10:48.875 --> 10:51.333
-Someone left the cooktop on!
-Fire extinguisher!

10:51.417 --> 10:52.792
[screams]

11:00.417 --> 11:02.667
Oh, tell me that's not what I think it is.

11:03.458 --> 11:05.041
-All our home movies.
-Oh, no.

11:05.125 --> 11:08.333
-We killed them.
-["Taps" playing]

11:08.417 --> 11:11.333
-What is going on here?
-Oh, I don't know. I just got here.

11:13.041 --> 11:15.542
Are those our home movies?

11:15.959 --> 11:17.750
-We're so sorry.
-Mom.

11:17.834 --> 11:19.709
You're sorry?!

11:19.792 --> 11:23.250
-Mom, I--
-How can you be so irresponsible?

11:23.333 --> 11:25.917
-But, Mom, we can explain.
-How can you explain

11:26.000 --> 11:27.917
ruining all of our memories?

11:28.000 --> 11:29.834
-But--
-Those are our home movies.

11:29.917 --> 11:32.500
And now they're gone forever.
[crying]

11:38.667 --> 11:40.542
We're very disappointed in you boys.

11:57.792 --> 12:00.083
This... this is great broccoli, honey.

12:00.166 --> 12:02.208
[boys]
Awesome. Really. Love it.

12:02.291 --> 12:04.917
-It's some of your best work.
-[watch beeping]

12:05.000 --> 12:07.250
Oh, well, it's been another
five minutes, boys.

12:07.333 --> 12:09.458
Time to apologize to your mother again.

12:09.542 --> 12:11.208
-Go ahead, Nick.
-Mom...

12:12.333 --> 12:14.542
we feel horrible about
ruining the home movies.

12:14.625 --> 12:16.542
I know you do.

12:16.625 --> 12:19.709
-We are so sorry.
-I know you are.

12:19.792 --> 12:23.166
Apparently, a colander is some
kind of bowl with holes in it.

12:24.166 --> 12:25.750
I know it is.

12:25.834 --> 12:28.333
And I love you boys more
than anything in the world.

12:34.750 --> 12:38.208
Why does she have to make it so hard?

12:42.000 --> 12:46.834
We batter, burn and foam all her memories
and she forgives us?!

12:46.917 --> 12:51.458
Yeah, and she'll never mention it again.
She'll be all sweet and loving.

12:51.542 --> 12:54.917
-It's going to be torture.
-We should just move out.

12:55.000 --> 12:56.959
Let 'em raise Frankie in peace.

12:58.041 --> 13:00.500
Wait a minute.
I've got an idea.

13:01.458 --> 13:04.875
We can't save the videotapes,
but we can save the memories.

13:04.959 --> 13:06.750
Kevin, it sounds like
you've got a scheme in mind

13:06.834 --> 13:08.834
and we're supposed to ask you what it is.

13:11.625 --> 13:13.417
Oh, right, me. OK.

13:13.500 --> 13:16.000
Um, we get a camera,
we build some sets,

13:16.083 --> 13:17.792
we have Stella help us out
with some costumes,

13:17.875 --> 13:19.875
we reenact our home movies

13:19.959 --> 13:22.750
-and then we videotape 'em.
-Genius.

13:23.875 --> 13:27.208
And I thought it was going to be
something completely ridiculous.

13:31.375 --> 13:32.542
I'm proud of you.

13:32.875 --> 13:34.417
Stop hugging me now.

13:34.750 --> 13:36.458
No, all right.

13:48.041 --> 13:49.291
[Kevin]
Cut, cut, cut!

13:51.083 --> 13:52.625
Just, something doesn't feel right.

13:52.709 --> 13:55.208
You're playing too good.
And you need to dance

13:55.291 --> 13:58.500
-like you need to go to the bathroom.
-But I don't have to go to the bathroom.

13:58.583 --> 14:01.583
[clock ticking]

14:01.667 --> 14:04.291
OK, I really gotta go now.
Do this.

14:04.375 --> 14:06.750
Perfect. Action!

14:13.959 --> 14:15.000
Cut!

14:17.792 --> 14:20.375
[Joe]
All right. Action, Kevin.

14:21.792 --> 14:23.375
Nice.

14:23.458 --> 14:25.500
Did you have those boots
on in the original movie?

14:25.583 --> 14:27.250
I do now!

14:27.333 --> 14:30.083
[Joe]
Kevin with lasso, take one.

14:34.583 --> 14:35.709
[loud crash]

14:36.542 --> 14:39.417
-That's not it.
-[Joe] Kevin with lasso, take two.

14:39.500 --> 14:41.208
-[shattering]
-[Joe] Take six.

14:42.792 --> 14:44.250
-[grunts]
-[Joe] Take ten.

14:44.333 --> 14:46.000
-Here we go.
-[loud crash]

14:46.083 --> 14:48.792
-[cat screeches]
-[Joe] Kevin with lasso, take 13.

14:50.333 --> 14:52.083
Are you gonna count every single take?

14:52.166 --> 14:54.542
[Joe] Are you going to miss
every single take?

14:56.041 --> 14:58.000
That's right.
Here we go.

15:02.500 --> 15:04.208
[Joe]
Cut. Print.

15:06.458 --> 15:08.125
All right.
[clears throat]

15:08.208 --> 15:09.834
All right, good.

15:11.792 --> 15:13.917
All right, action.

15:14.625 --> 15:16.917
Trick or...

15:18.000 --> 15:20.625
-Trick or...
-It's trick... trick or treat.

15:20.709 --> 15:22.250
Everybody says trick or treat.

15:22.333 --> 15:24.375
I want to take my character
in a new direction.

15:24.458 --> 15:28.417
You're a Halloween cowboy.
There are no other directions to take it.

15:28.500 --> 15:30.041
What about a zombie cowboy?

15:30.166 --> 15:34.792
A zombie cowboy would say,
"trick or brains!"

15:34.875 --> 15:37.709
I can't work under these conditions!

15:37.792 --> 15:41.458
-Dude, I was just kidding, man.
-You want to go see a play?

15:41.542 --> 15:43.333
[Joe] Let's do this, people!

15:43.667 --> 15:44.709
Lights.

15:48.291 --> 15:50.375
-Snow.
-Whoo...

15:50.458 --> 15:51.959
Stella.

15:56.959 --> 15:59.208
Perfect. OK, grab the eggnog.

16:04.000 --> 16:05.792
OK, I'm not doing this.

16:05.875 --> 16:07.625
What?

16:07.709 --> 16:09.792
We all know what's gonna happen.
I drink the eggnog,

16:09.875 --> 16:11.417
my headgear makes it spill
down the front of me

16:11.542 --> 16:13.625
and I get a rash on Christmas.

16:14.000 --> 16:15.417
Will you talk to her?

16:15.500 --> 16:19.959
Stella, this is one of our mom's
most cherished memories.

16:23.917 --> 16:25.333
Roll 'em.

16:25.834 --> 16:28.000
All right, here we go.
Here we go, here we go.

16:28.542 --> 16:30.792
[all] Merry Christmas!

16:30.875 --> 16:32.792
-[Kevin] Yeah! Whoo!
-[Nick] Whoa!

16:32.875 --> 16:36.000
-Whoa! Cut, cut! What are you doing?
-My mouth is bigger now. I'm sorry.

16:36.083 --> 16:38.583
Why do you hate our mother?

16:40.500 --> 16:42.583
-Roll 'em.
-[Joe] OK, let's do this.

16:42.667 --> 16:46.875
-Here we go, here we go.
-[all] Merry Christmas!

16:51.208 --> 16:53.750
-Awesome!
-Happy?

16:53.834 --> 16:55.917
-I think I could see that again?
-You know, I just don't

16:56.000 --> 16:57.000
think it was good enough.
I think we need a second take.

16:57.083 --> 16:57.959
Back to one.

16:58.041 --> 17:01.792
-[Joe] Sorry, just wasn't good enough.
-Ew...

17:04.000 --> 17:06.542
OK, here's the scene:
Nick's second birthday,

17:06.625 --> 17:09.750
the candles...
Wow, that's a very large high chair.

17:09.834 --> 17:12.250
OK. Um, the camera's over here...

17:12.333 --> 17:14.083
Where's the camera?

17:14.166 --> 17:15.333
-Joe?
-I didn't touch it.

17:15.417 --> 17:17.625
That has everything we shot on it.

17:18.375 --> 17:19.500
Find it!

17:32.041 --> 17:34.417
[light jazz playing]

17:34.500 --> 17:37.083
[shutter clicking]

17:44.792 --> 17:46.166
[grunts]

18:11.667 --> 18:14.417
-Not it.
-We've ruined the original home movies

18:14.500 --> 18:16.792
and then we lose the new ones.
We're incredible.

18:20.583 --> 18:22.583
Frankie, where is it?

18:22.667 --> 18:24.750
-Where's what?
-The video camera.

18:24.834 --> 18:27.458
Silver and black about this big?

18:27.542 --> 18:30.583
-That's the one.
-OK, I got about $16.

18:30.667 --> 18:32.583
Joe, Nick, what do you got?

18:32.667 --> 18:35.166
-I don't want money.
-What do you want?

18:35.250 --> 18:37.000
I want to be in the movies.

18:37.083 --> 18:39.041
But you weren't born yet.

18:39.125 --> 18:40.834
Well, I'm born now.

18:53.041 --> 18:54.333
What's going on?

18:55.208 --> 18:56.417
Mom...

18:57.792 --> 18:59.959
We know how upset you are
about the home videos.

19:00.041 --> 19:03.291
-I'm not upset.
-Boys, your mom is not upset.

19:03.375 --> 19:07.500
-[no dialogue]
-Mom, you are killing us with kindness.

19:07.583 --> 19:10.458
-All right, I'm upset.
-[boys] Thank you.

19:10.542 --> 19:13.667
But what good does it do
to take it out on my boys?

19:13.750 --> 19:17.458
You didn't mean to...
cut out a mother's heart.

19:20.375 --> 19:23.667
Well, we realized we can
never replace the home videos

19:23.750 --> 19:25.959
-that Joe destroyed.
-Me?! You poured the batter!

19:26.041 --> 19:28.417
-You got the bowl with the holes in it.
-It's a "colynder"!

19:28.500 --> 19:30.583
-It's a calendar.
-It's a colander!

19:30.667 --> 19:32.959
Guys, what's this all about?
We've got guests coming any minute.

19:33.041 --> 19:35.125
[Nick]
Mom, we redid the home movies.

19:36.792 --> 19:38.625
[piano music playing]

19:45.208 --> 19:47.291
[banging]

19:48.709 --> 19:51.041
[laughing]
I don't believe it.

19:51.417 --> 19:53.250
<i>Trick or...</i>

19:55.250 --> 19:57.583
<i>Trick or...</i>

19:57.667 --> 19:58.792
[laughs]

20:04.000 --> 20:06.291
<i>Oh, I was so...</i>
[grunts]

20:06.375 --> 20:08.166
I can't believe you did this!

20:08.250 --> 20:10.125
-[Stella] <i>Dinner!</i>
-[boys] <i>Turkey!</i>

20:10.208 --> 20:12.792
[shouting]

20:15.208 --> 20:16.667
[Stella]
<i>Sit down. Please sit down.</i>

20:16.750 --> 20:19.125
-[boys humming]
-[indistinct] <i>Boys!</i>

20:29.375 --> 20:31.834
Is that me?
Is that me? Hold on.

20:31.917 --> 20:33.875
[all]
<i>Happy thanksgiving!</i>

20:35.709 --> 20:38.583
-Uh-oh.
-Sad crying?

20:40.166 --> 20:42.083
Happy crying?

20:43.500 --> 20:44.917
Proud crying?

20:47.333 --> 20:48.750
You guys are amazing.

20:48.834 --> 20:51.542
-I love you so much.
-Thank you.

20:51.625 --> 20:55.875
This is absolutely the best
birthday present I have ever had.

20:56.166 --> 20:59.083
And you know what?
I think I may even

20:59.166 --> 21:01.208
like the new home movies
better than the old ones.

21:01.291 --> 21:03.125
[all chuckle]

21:03.208 --> 21:05.333
I can't wait to see what
you guys ruin next year.

21:06.709 --> 21:08.667
Please don't ruin anything next year.

21:13.834 --> 21:17.250
-What's this?
-Frankie wanted to direct.

21:26.250 --> 21:28.041
Do I have great boys or what?

21:28.125 --> 21:30.375
Yeah, you've got
the best boys in the world.

21:30.458 --> 21:32.667
OK, everyone,
it's actually not over quite yet.

21:32.750 --> 21:35.417
We have a special feature to show you.

21:35.500 --> 21:37.125
What?
What special feature?

21:37.208 --> 21:38.917
-Oh, you'll see.
-[chuckles]

21:39.000 --> 21:40.500
Very special.

21:40.583 --> 21:44.458
-[clicks]
-[whimsical music playing]

21:44.709 --> 21:46.500
-[all] Awww!
-No, no, no, no!

21:46.583 --> 21:47.458
[laughing]

21:49.667 --> 21:53.083
[Stella] Oh... that was my mom's dress.
I love that dress.

21:53.166 --> 21:55.500
It's too bad it doesn't fit me.

21:55.583 --> 21:57.667
-Too small?
-[sighs]

21:57.750 --> 22:00.041
-Too big.
-Ah.

22:00.125 --> 22:03.250
[Stella] Wait a minute.
I told my mom to erase this tape.

22:03.333 --> 22:07.166
Maybe somebody made a copy.

22:08.250 --> 22:09.500
Oh, no, you didn't.

22:12.166 --> 22:13.583
Yeah, you better run.

22:15.500 --> 22:17.000
-Oh boy.
-Oh!

22:20.583 --> 22:22.917
-I'm wearing heels!
-[thuds]

22:23.000 --> 22:24.333
[Joe screams]
