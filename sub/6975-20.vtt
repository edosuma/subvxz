We call it the miracle of life.

00:09.890 --> 00:14.054
Conception:
a union of perfect opposites--

00:14.094 --> 00:17.359
essence transforming
into existence--

00:17.431 --> 00:20.696
an act without which
mankind would not exist

00:20.767 --> 00:24.066
and humanity cease to exist.

00:24.104 --> 00:26.698
Or is this just nostalgia now?

00:26.773 --> 00:28.741
An act of biology commandeered

00:28.775 --> 00:31.505

and technology?

implant, inseminate...

00:35.949 --> 00:38.543

00:38.618 --> 00:40.711
But has our ingenuity
rendered the miracle

00:40.787 --> 00:42.755
into a simple trick?

00:42.823 --> 00:44.415
In the artifiice
of replicating life

00:44.491 --> 00:46.652
can we become the creator?

00:46.727 --> 00:48.752
Then what of the soul?

00:48.829 --> 00:51.024
Can it, too, be replicated?

00:51.098 --> 00:53.862
Does it live
in this matter we call DNA?

00:53.934 --> 00:55.959
Or is its placement
the opposite of artifiice

01:03.977 --> 01:07.037
Is it the product of a union?

Or the work of a divine hand?

01:09.916 --> 01:11.850
An answered prayer?

A true miracle?

For the past ten years

28:39.731 --> 28:42.029
I've been working
as a research scientist

28:42.100 --> 28:43.658

human clones--

28:43.702 --> 28:47.365
long before the media circus
with sheep and cows.

28:47.439 --> 28:52.206
The work was painstaking,
largely unsuccessful

28:52.244 --> 28:56.305
but there was a lot of interest
and a lot of money.

28:56.381 --> 28:58.713
Money from who?

28:58.784 --> 29:01.218
Orders came from government men.

29:01.286 --> 29:04.813
But they're all dead now.

29:05.057 --> 29:07.821
But the work continued.

29:08.060 --> 29:10.551
We were surprisingly successful

29:10.595 --> 29:14.031
with a clone from a human egg
and alien DNA.

29:14.099 --> 29:15.430

29:15.467 --> 29:17.458
since 1947.

more than a couple of days

is what we were after

29:41.493 --> 29:44.053
