<i>I'LL SEE WHAT WE CAN DO.</i>
<i>[ DOOR CLOSES ]</i>

39:18.756 --> 39:21.358
IMPACT STATEMENTS
COME FROM VICTIMS.

39:21.360 --> 39:23.193
I'M NOT A VICTIM.

39:23.195 --> 39:25.528
[ SIGHS ]

39:25.530 --> 39:27.130
STROH TRIED TO KILL YOU.

39:27.132 --> 39:29.733
HE HIT YOU IN THE HEAD
WITH A SHOVEL.

39:29.735 --> 39:31.334
HE PUSHED YOU INTO A CANYON.

39:31.336 --> 39:34.003
HE SLICED YOUR LEG OPEN
WITH A KNIFE.

39:34.005 --> 39:36.039
AND THAT'S ALL
ATTEMPTED MURDER.

39:37.241 --> 39:39.609
RIGHT.
RIGHT.

39:39.611 --> 39:41.578
I SEE.

39:41.580 --> 39:43.947
AND YOU'RE SAYING THAT
EMMA WANTS ME

39:43.949 --> 39:45.749
TO WRITE ABOUT STROH
BECAUSE...

39:45.751 --> 39:47.884
SHE DOESN'T WANT THE DEAL
TO GO FORWARD.

39:47.886 --> 39:50.887
NO MATTER WHAT INFORMATION COMES
THROUGH THE SPECIAL MASTER,

39:50.889 --> 39:53.490
EMMA STILL THINKS STROH
SHOULD GO TO TRIAL

39:53.492 --> 39:54.724
FOR MURDER IN THE FIRST

39:54.726 --> 39:57.627
WITH SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES
ATTACHED.

39:57.629 --> 40:01.097
DID SHE EVER ACTUALLY TELL YOU
OTHERWISE?

40:03.834 --> 40:07.036
NO. UM...
[ BREATHES SHARPLY ]

40:07.038 --> 40:10.073
I FEEL LIKE SUCH AN IDIOT. UH...
MNH-MNH.

40:11.175 --> 40:13.276
LAWYERS ARE SO...

40:15.579 --> 40:17.247
I'M SORRY, I JUST, LIKE --
NO.

40:17.249 --> 40:20.583
EMMA SHOULD HAVE BEEN CLEARER
WITH YOU ABOUT HER INTENTIONS.

40:20.585 --> 40:23.420
I'LL TALK TO HER
ABOUT THAT.

40:23.422 --> 40:25.755
BUT...DEAL OR NO DEAL,

40:25.757 --> 40:27.524
SOMETIME
IN THE NEXT TWO WEEKS,

40:27.526 --> 40:30.260
THIS PHILLIP STROH BUSINESS
IS COMING TO A HEAD NOW.

40:30.262 --> 40:32.061
JUST SO YOU KNOW.

40:33.264 --> 40:35.198
THANK YOU, ANDREA.

40:36.767 --> 40:39.602
UM, YEAH, THANK YOU.
THANK YOU, ANDREA.

40:39.604 --> 40:41.471
I DO APPRECIATE THE TRUTH.

40:41.473 --> 40:43.039
I DO.

40:46.243 --> 40:47.877
[ DOOR CLOSES ]

40:48.913 --> 40:50.413
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK?

40:50.415 --> 40:54.250
I MEAN, SH-SHOULD I WRITE
THE IMPACT STATEMENT OR NOT?

40:56.754 --> 40:59.055
IT'S A CHOICE

40:59.057 --> 41:02.892
BETWEEN PUTTING SOMEONE
IN AN INSTITUTION FOR LIFE,

41:02.894 --> 41:05.462
OR PUTTING THEM TO DEATH
BECAUSE THEY ARE IN SOME WAY

41:05.464 --> 41:08.865
A DANGER, AND LACK THE MENTAL
CAPACITY FOR CHANGE.

41:10.367 --> 41:13.136
IT'S AN AWFUL THING
TO HAVE TO CONSIDER.

41:14.939 --> 41:17.273
BUT YOU'VE BEEN GIVEN
A VOICE HERE,

41:17.275 --> 41:19.409
IF NOT THE LAST WORD.

41:20.711 --> 41:22.712
IF IT WERE UP TO
RUSTY BECK,

41:22.714 --> 41:24.614
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN

41:24.616 --> 41:27.283
TO SOMEONE
LIKE PHILLIP STROH?
