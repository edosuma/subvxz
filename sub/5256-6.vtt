02:43.063 --> 02:45.097

03:05.019 --> 03:06.151
<i>And he's got a beard.</i>

03:06.153 --> 03:07.819
<i>And they're like,</i>
<i>I bought this lithograph</i>

03:07.821 --> 03:10.322
<i>For, like, a bunch of money,</i>
<i>and it's a joke now</i>

03:10.324 --> 03:14.126
<i>Because he's got a blank face,</i>
<i>he's got a shaved face.</i>

03:14.128 --> 03:16.795
<i>And milton bradley's like,</i>
<i>I've spent all my ink</i>

03:16.797 --> 03:18.964
<i>On all these</i>
<i>garbage lithographs.</i>

03:18.966 --> 03:22.034
<i>So he burns them all,</i>
<i>and he's completely done for.</i>

03:22.036 --> 03:24.236
<i>So he's like, I have</i>
<i>this lithograph machine.</i>

03:24.238 --> 03:25.704
<i>It's, like, this big</i>
<i>hunk of junk.</i>

03:25.706 --> 03:28.674
<i>I don't even have</i>
<i>a good picture to print.</i>

03:28.676 --> 03:29.408
<i>What am I gonna do?</i>

03:32.479 --> 03:35.113
<i>And they're playing</i>
<i>this, like, puritan game.</i>

03:35.115 --> 03:36.248
<i>It's, like, really boring.</i>

03:36.250 --> 03:37.516
<i>So he realized</i>
<i>during the game,</i>

03:37.518 --> 03:40.185
<i>I could make a game</i>
<i>better than this.</i>

03:40.187 --> 03:41.220
<i>I could come up with a game</i>

03:41.222 --> 03:45.591
<i>That people who aren't</i>
<i>all puritan-minded would enjoy,</i>

03:45.593 --> 03:49.061
<i>And he calls his game</i>
<i>the checkered game of life.</i>

03:49.063 --> 03:50.529
<i>The checkered game of life!</i>

03:50.531 --> 03:52.431
<i>And george was like,</i>
<i>a new game to play.</i>

03:52.433 --> 03:54.032
Like, they didn't have
anything else

03:54.034 --> 03:55.734
To entertain themselves,
you know?

03:55.736 --> 03:56.668
<i>And milton bradley's like,</i>

03:56.670 --> 03:59.004
<i>Every other square</i>
<i>has, like, a thing on it.</i>

03:59.006 --> 04:00.572
<i>You know,</i>
<i>and the goal is to reach</i>

04:00.574 --> 04:01.907
<i>The ripe old age of 50.</i>

04:01.909 --> 04:03.875
<i>And the not goal</i>
<i>is to reach ruin</i>

04:03.877 --> 04:06.211
<i>And have complete</i>
<i>destruction in your life.</i>

04:06.213 --> 04:09.248
<i>And in the middle,</i>
<i>there was suicide.</i>

04:09.250 --> 04:10.816
<i>Well, good night.</i>

04:10.818 --> 04:12.217
<i>So, he goes to new york</i>
<i>with the game,</i>

04:12.219 --> 04:14.953
<i>And he's like, hey, everybody,</i>
<i>I got this new game.</i>

04:14.955 --> 04:16.054
<i>It's, like, american.</i>

04:16.056 --> 04:17.322
<i>It's not just puritan.</i>

04:17.324 --> 04:19.024
<i>It's, like, [bleep] cool.</i>

04:19.026 --> 04:20.125
<i>And everyone's buying it.</i>

04:20.127 --> 04:23.595
<i>He sells 40,000 copies</i>
<i>in one weekend.</i>

04:23.597 --> 04:27.466
And then he's dumb because
the civil war happened,

04:27.468 --> 04:28.500
<i>Like, the next day.</i>

04:28.502 --> 04:30.302
<i>Everyone's like,</i>
<i>we're only doing war.</i>

04:30.304 --> 04:31.970
<i>We don't--</i>
<i>we don't play games.</i>

04:31.972 --> 04:35.140
<i>And then because he's so smart,</i>
<i>milton bradley's like,</i>

04:35.142 --> 04:37.509
<i>Soldiers have a lot</i>
<i>of downtime.</i>

04:37.511 --> 04:39.845
<i>I'm gonna make these games</i>
<i>really tiny</i>

04:39.847 --> 04:41.546
<i>So soldiers can have them</i>
<i>in their pocket,</i>

04:41.548 --> 04:43.949
<i>And then the second they're</i>
<i>bored, they can play it.</i>

04:43.951 --> 04:45.484
<i>And so he takes the game,</i>

04:45.486 --> 04:48.520
And he squishes it
into, like, small.

04:48.522 --> 04:52.824
<i>And on this board,</i>
<i>you can play checkers and chess</i>

04:52.826 --> 04:55.861
<i>And backgammon and</i>
<i>the checkered game of life.</i>

04:55.863 --> 04:57.629
<i>And all these charities</i>
<i>were like,</i>

04:57.631 --> 04:59.264
<i>We're gonna buy these</i>
<i>for a dollar,</i>

04:59.266 --> 05:00.532
<i>And we're gonna give them</i>
<i>to soldiers,</i>

05:00.534 --> 05:02.234
<i>And the soldiers</i>
<i>will have something to do.</i>

05:02.236 --> 05:03.435
<i>And all the soldiers</i>
<i>were like,</i>

05:03.437 --> 05:05.904
<i>This is so cool,</i>
<i>like someone thought of us.</i>

05:05.906 --> 05:09.341
<i>And they would play</i>
<i>the game in their downtime.</i>

05:09.343 --> 05:10.208
- That must have been nice.

05:10.210 --> 05:11.843
- It was really fun for them,
and they were like,

05:11.845 --> 05:13.745
<i>We're so happy</i>
<i>we have a thing to do.</i>

05:13.747 --> 05:15.447
<i>It's not just</i>
<i>look at each other</i>

05:15.449 --> 05:17.683
<i>While we wait</i>
<i>to shoot somebody.</i>

05:17.685 --> 05:18.483
<i>Milton bradley's like,</i>

05:18.485 --> 05:21.253
<i>Yes, I came up</i>
<i>with a cool idea again.</i>

05:21.255 --> 05:22.287
<i>Everyone likes it.</i>

05:22.289 --> 05:25.257
<i>And so the war ends,</i>
<i>and everyone was like,</i>

05:25.259 --> 05:27.659
<i>We have time now,</i>
<i>we can play games.</i>

05:27.661 --> 05:28.493
<i>We want more games.</i>

05:28.495 --> 05:30.796
<i>So, he starts printing out</i>
<i>the checkered game of life.</i>

05:30.798 --> 05:32.431
<i>And he made other games,</i>
<i>and he was selling them,</i>

05:32.433 --> 05:33.799
<i>And they were</i>
<i>really popular.</i>

05:33.801 --> 05:34.900
<i>And then</i>
<i>milton bradley started</i>

05:34.902 --> 05:37.336
<i>The milton bradley company,</i>
<i>and they make all the games.</i>

05:37.338 --> 05:41.473
<i>I mean, like, candyland,</i>
<i>jenga, guess who?,</i>

05:41.475 --> 05:42.974
<i>Battleship, twister.</i>

05:42.976 --> 05:46.478
And board games are still
18x18 inches,

05:46.480 --> 05:48.714
<i>Because that's the size</i>
<i>of the cardboard</i>

05:48.716 --> 05:50.782
<i>That fit into</i>
<i>the lithograph machine,</i>

05:50.784 --> 05:52.317

Hello.

Cheers.

07:01.288 --> 07:03.121
<i>So, 1942,</i>

07:03.123 --> 07:06.057
<i>Fiorello henry la guardia,</i>

07:06.059 --> 07:07.426
<i>Mayor of new york, goes,</i>

07:07.428 --> 07:10.996
<i>You know what,</i>
<i>this pinball thing is evil.</i>

07:10.998 --> 07:14.966
<i>We're gonna ban</i>
<i>[bleep] pinball, dude.</i>

07:14.968 --> 07:16.401
<i>Not gonna ball around.</i>

07:16.403 --> 07:18.336
<i>You know, just it's a game.</i>

07:18.338 --> 07:20.472
<i>We're gonna ban it.</i>
<i>Why pinball?</i>

07:20.474 --> 07:23.475
Because pinball is
a game of chance.

07:23.477 --> 07:25.877
It's a [bleep] game, dude.

07:25.879 --> 07:26.445
- Yeah.

07:26.447 --> 07:29.080
- All right,
so, the new york police

07:29.082 --> 07:31.149
<i>Start raiding restaurants.</i>

07:31.151 --> 07:32.951
<i>Oh, you got</i>
<i>a pinball machine here.</i>

07:32.953 --> 07:36.087
<i>So, it's okay</i>
<i>if we [ bleep] it up.</i>

07:36.089 --> 07:37.155
<i>The new york police department</i>

07:37.157 --> 07:39.591
<i>Confiscated</i>
<i>the pinball machines.</i>

07:39.593 --> 07:41.193
<i>La guardia smashed them,</i>

07:41.195 --> 07:44.062
<i>And then pushed them</i>
<i>into the hudson river.</i>

07:44.064 --> 07:46.531
<i>A lot of smaller cities</i>
<i>around america</i>

07:46.533 --> 07:47.933
<i>Would follow</i>
<i>what new york did.</i>

07:47.935 --> 07:52.137
<i>So all around america,</i>
<i>yeah, pinball is illegal.</i>

07:52.139 --> 07:54.940
<i>Cut to decades later</i>
<i>in the early '70s,</i>

07:54.942 --> 07:57.209
<i>There's this guy</i>
<i>roger sharpe.</i>

07:57.211 --> 07:59.878
<i>Roger sharpe is this writer.</i>

07:59.880 --> 08:02.113

<i>in his off time</i>

08:02.115 --> 08:04.115
<i>Is he plays pinball.</i>

08:04.117 --> 08:06.852
<i>But he has to do it, like,</i>
<i>under the radar,</i>

08:06.854 --> 08:09.221
<i>Because pinball</i>
<i>is still illegal.</i>

08:09.223 --> 08:10.222
<i>You know, roger sharpe.</i>

08:10.224 --> 08:12.491
<i>He's one of the best</i>
<i>in the world.</i>

08:12.493 --> 08:15.627
<i>He's like, hey,</i>
<i>I'm good at this.</i>

08:15.629 --> 08:18.497
<i>I know how to make</i>
<i>this pinball move,</i>

08:18.499 --> 08:23.101
And it's not chance,
it's not gambling.

08:23.103 --> 08:24.503
So, in the mist--

08:24.505 --> 08:26.538
In the--
in the midst--

08:26.540 --> 08:29.674
In the midst--mist--mist--

08:29.676 --> 08:30.275
- Mid--

08:30.277 --> 08:32.077
- Midst.
Is there a d in there?

08:32.079 --> 08:33.812
Midst, right?
- Mm-hmm.

08:33.814 --> 08:35.247
-<i> I'm serious. Midst?</i>
- Mm-hmm.

08:35.249 --> 08:36.781
- In the midst of all this,

08:36.783 --> 08:40.185
<i>The american music</i>
<i>& amusement association,</i>

08:40.187 --> 08:41.052
<i>Which is kind of like</i>

08:41.054 --> 08:44.356
<i>The pinball manufacturers</i>
<i>of america, was like,</i>

08:44.358 --> 08:48.059
<i>All right, look, pinball</i>
<i>was declared illegal, right?</i>

08:48.061 --> 08:50.929
<i>That's crazy.</i>
<i>That's [bleep] crazy.</i>

08:50.931 --> 08:55.000
<i>We have to do something.</i>
<i>We have to save our industry.</i>

08:55.002 --> 08:56.301
[belches]

08:56.303 --> 08:57.302
- Jeez.

08:57.304 --> 09:02.841
- So, the american music
& music association

09:02.843 --> 09:04.743
<i>Call roger sharpe</i>
<i>and they're like,</i>

09:04.745 --> 09:06.511
<i>Hey, we're [bleep] here.</i>

09:06.513 --> 09:07.579
<i>You've gotta help us out.</i>

09:07.581 --> 09:11.283
<i>And he goes, okay, I gotta do</i>
<i>what I gotta do.</i>

09:11.285 --> 09:13.518
<i>So, they bring roger sharpe</i>

09:13.520 --> 09:15.954
<i>In front of</i>
<i>the new york city council</i>

09:15.956 --> 09:19.090
<i>To try to get</i>
<i>pinball legalized.</i>

09:19.092 --> 09:22.427
<i>The news media is there.</i>
<i>This is a big deal.</i>

09:22.429 --> 09:24.930
<i>This is 1976.</i>

09:26.599 --> 09:27.632
I'm [bleep] up.

09:27.634 --> 09:30.001
<i>So there's kinda like</i>
<i>this moment where he's like,</i>

09:30.003 --> 09:31.603
<i>You know what, look,</i>

09:31.605 --> 09:33.238
<i>If I'm good enough at pinball,</i>

09:33.240 --> 09:34.372
<i>I can succeed at pinball.</i>

09:34.374 --> 09:36.441
<i>I'm not just--</i>
<i>this isn't just gambling.</i>

09:36.443 --> 09:38.443
<i>This is like, you know,</i>
<i>I'm having fun.</i>

09:38.445 --> 09:41.446
<i>This is--</i>
<i>this is a game of skill.</i>

09:41.448 --> 09:43.682
<i>Does that make sense?</i>

09:43.684 --> 09:46.551
<i>[belches]</i>

09:46.553 --> 09:47.519
<i>- Jeez.</i>

09:47.521 --> 09:50.121
-<i> All right, so roger sharpe</i>

09:50.123 --> 09:53.158
<i>Steps up to</i>
<i>the el dorado machine.</i>

09:53.160 --> 09:54.092
<i>He's playing on it.</i>

09:54.094 --> 09:56.294
<i>He's just, you know,</i>
<i>banging the ball around</i>

09:56.296 --> 09:57.829
<i>On this el dorado machine.</i>

09:57.831 --> 09:58.797
<i>But then there's one prick</i>

09:58.799 --> 10:01.666
<i>On the [bleep] board</i>
<i>of the city council who's like,</i>

10:01.668 --> 10:04.169
<i>No, no, no, no,</i>
<i>no, no, no, no, no.</i>

10:04.171 --> 10:06.237
<i>You guys are trying</i>
<i>to pull a fast one.</i>

10:06.239 --> 10:08.340
<i>This machine</i>
<i>is probably set up</i>

10:08.342 --> 10:10.241
<i>So he could try</i>
<i>to impress us.</i>

10:10.243 --> 10:12.544
<i>I want him to play</i>
<i>the backup machine,</i>

10:12.546 --> 10:14.045
<i>Which is bank shot.</i>

10:14.047 --> 10:14.713
<i>[dramatic music]</i>

10:14.715 --> 10:17.882
Now, roger sharpe had never
played that other machine.

10:17.884 --> 10:20.485
He'd never even--
like, not even one quarter.

10:20.487 --> 10:21.920
He had never played it.

10:21.922 --> 10:23.822
But he's like,
I'll play it.

10:23.824 --> 10:26.191
<i>I'll play bank--bank shot?</i>

10:26.193 --> 10:28.793
<i>But I will show you</i>
<i>mother[bleep]</i>

10:28.795 --> 10:30.762
<i>That this is a game of skill.</i>

10:30.764 --> 10:34.132
<i>Roger sharpe goes over</i>
<i>to the bank shot machine.</i>

10:34.134 --> 10:36.368
<i>He plays it</i>
<i>for a few minutes,</i>

10:36.370 --> 10:37.936
And he's, like,
mastering it, right?

10:37.938 --> 10:40.105
He's, you know,
batting the ball around.

10:40.107 --> 10:41.539
<i>Still nobody's impressed.</i>

10:41.541 --> 10:42.807
<i>They're like, eh, whatever.</i>

10:42.809 --> 10:46.611
<i>He looks at everybody</i>
<i>in the city council</i>

10:46.613 --> 10:47.545
And no [bleep],

10:47.547 --> 10:50.649
Straight out
of babe ruth's book,

10:50.651 --> 10:54.486
<i>He goes, listen up,</i>
<i>I'm gonna call my shot.</i>

10:54.488 --> 10:55.620
<i>See the ball?</i>

10:55.622 --> 10:57.689
<i>I'm gonna pull</i>
<i>this plunger back</i>

10:57.691 --> 10:59.224
<i>A certain distance,</i>

10:59.226 --> 11:00.291
<i>I'm gonna launch the ball,</i>

11:00.293 --> 11:04.162
<i>And that ball is gonna</i>
<i>go into that center slot.</i>

11:04.164 --> 11:06.197
<i>Everyone's like,</i>
<i>yeah, whatever.</i>

11:06.199 --> 11:09.067
<i>So the pressure</i>
<i>is on this dude's shoulders.</i>

11:09.069 --> 11:13.238
<i>He pulls back the plunger</i>
<i>just enough, lets it go,</i>

11:13.240 --> 11:17.308
<i>And the pinball goes up</i>
<i>the playfield</i>

11:17.310 --> 11:20.045
<i>And lands right in</i>
<i>that middle slot</i>

11:20.047 --> 11:21.913
<i>Where he says</i>
<i>it's gonna go.</i>

11:21.915 --> 11:23.014
<i>Right at that moment,</i>

11:23.016 --> 11:25.550
<i>One of the councilmen</i>
<i>just grabbed his gavel,</i>

11:25.552 --> 11:30.021
Smacked the--
smacked the, you know...

11:30.023 --> 11:32.123
<i>Whatever he smacks and goes,</i>

11:32.125 --> 11:34.392
<i>Pinball is now legal.</i>

11:34.394 --> 11:38.530
<i>Across america, all the cities</i>
<i>who just kowtowed</i>

11:38.532 --> 11:40.832
<i>To whatever new york did</i>
<i>were like,</i>

11:40.834 --> 11:42.701
<i>Yeah, okay,</i>
<i>pinball is legal</i>

11:42.703 --> 11:44.102
<i>And blah, blah, blah, blah.</i>

11:44.104 --> 11:46.004
<i>So it really did</i>
<i>all come down</i>

11:46.006 --> 11:47.806
<i>To that one called shot.</i>

11:47.808 --> 11:50.542
This is not a guy
that's regularly--

11:50.544 --> 11:52.777
Regul--

11:52.779 --> 11:56.681
Regulated to the anals
of history.

11:56.683 --> 11:57.849
<i>Roger sharpe was a dude</i>

11:57.851 --> 12:01.352
<i>Who was asked to show off</i>
<i>his skills</i>

12:01.354 --> 12:05.223
<i>In order to save</i>
<i>an entire industry,</i>

12:05.225 --> 12:06.424
Which he did.

12:06.426 --> 12:08.059
-<i> Two balls!</i>

12:09.795 --> 12:11.463
<i>Nine ball.</i>

12:11.465 --> 12:12.697
- This is sad.

12:12.699 --> 12:14.933
- All right, I'm gonna
shoot it from here

12:14.935 --> 12:16.801
-<i> The four ball!</i>
- To the middle.

12:16.803 --> 12:18.269
Ready?

12:18.271 --> 12:19.904
- Wow.
- I called it, dude.

12:19.906 --> 12:22.974
- Roger sharpe.
Games.

12:22.976 --> 12:24.409
What would we do
without games?

12:24.411 --> 12:27.045
We'd actually have
to communicate.

12:30.916 --> 12:31.816
-<i> I think virtual reality</i>

12:31.818 --> 12:33.985
<i>Will be the biggest thing</i>
<i>starting next year.</i>

12:33.987 --> 12:34.586
- Okay.

12:34.588 --> 12:36.254
- You can step into
the device.

12:36.256 --> 12:39.124
Your body will be
completely tracked.

12:39.126 --> 12:40.291
Okay.

12:40.293 --> 12:41.760
- [groans]

12:41.762 --> 12:42.994
[grunting]

12:42.996 --> 12:45.363
Can you do this move, like--

12:45.365 --> 12:45.930
Oh!

12:45.932 --> 12:49.634
Wait, now I can't--
is anybody around me?

12:49.636 --> 12:51.302
[grunting]

12:51.304 --> 12:52.203
This is how you walk

12:52.205 --> 12:54.806
When you're trying not
to [bleep] in your pants.

12:54.808 --> 12:55.540
- [laughs]

12:55.542 --> 12:58.109
-<i> Stay on the path.</i>
- I'm trying.

12:58.111 --> 13:01.379
Whoa-ah!
[yells]

13:01.381 --> 13:04.015
My life!

13:04.017 --> 13:06.217
Let's cheers
to bobby fischer, yeah?

13:06.219 --> 13:08.419
- Here's the bobby b.

13:08.421 --> 13:09.454
F.

13:09.456 --> 13:10.688
- Check.

13:10.690 --> 13:11.923
- Mate.

13:11.925 --> 13:13.124
- [chuckles]

13:13.126 --> 13:14.492
- Hello.

13:14.494 --> 13:15.293
I'm rich fulcher,

13:15.295 --> 13:18.429
And today we're gonna talk
about bobby fischer,

13:18.431 --> 13:22.667
King of the chess people.

13:22.669 --> 13:24.602
<i>It's 1972.</i>

13:24.604 --> 13:27.138
<i>Bobby fischer is, like,</i>
<i>29 years old,</i>

13:27.140 --> 13:31.409
<i>And at the time, he had won</i>
<i>the u.S. Open championship</i>

13:31.411 --> 13:35.013
<i>And was</i>
<i>an international grandmaster.</i>

13:35.015 --> 13:37.682
<i>But he wasn't just</i>
<i>a normal chess player.</i>

13:37.684 --> 13:42.520
<i>He was going,</i>
<i>put, put, put, put, put, check!</i>

13:42.522 --> 13:44.823
<i>Woot, woot, woot, checkmate!</i>

13:44.825 --> 13:47.859
That was when he felt
most comfortable in life.

13:47.861 --> 13:52.030
And yet, russia had won
the world championship

13:52.032 --> 13:53.765
For the last 24 years.

13:53.767 --> 13:59.003
<i>Like, russia, russia,</i>
<i>russia, russia,</i>

13:59.005 --> 14:00.638
<i>Can--russia!</i>

14:00.640 --> 14:04.809
And russia used that
as sort of a pr campaign,

14:04.811 --> 14:06.845
<i>Like, we are the kings.</i>

14:06.847 --> 14:08.313
<i>We are not only communists,</i>

14:08.315 --> 14:11.182
<i>But we are</i>
<i>the intellectuals of the world</i>

14:11.184 --> 14:13.585
<i>Because we do chess.</i>

14:13.587 --> 14:16.421
<i>The world championships</i>
<i>are in iceland,</i>

14:16.423 --> 14:20.692
<i>And boris spassky, backed by</i>
<i>the russian government,</i>

14:20.694 --> 14:25.330
<i>Was like, bobby fischer</i>
<i>is too young and inexperienced</i>

14:25.332 --> 14:30.335
<i>For someone like me,</i>
<i>the world champion.</i>

14:30.337 --> 14:34.239
<i>Here's the thing,</i>
<i>fischer hated russians,</i>

14:34.241 --> 14:37.809
<i>And he called them</i>
<i>filthy pigs.</i>

14:37.811 --> 14:41.746
<i>So it was much more</i>
<i>than just a chess match.</i>

14:41.748 --> 14:44.515
<i>The cold war is happening.</i>

14:44.517 --> 14:48.887
Life<i> magazine called it</i>
<i>the match of the century,</i>

14:48.889 --> 14:52.156
And in the retrospect it was,

14:52.158 --> 14:55.793
Because it was the match
of the century.

14:55.795 --> 14:58.563
<i>And then</i>
<i>fischer didn't show up.</i>

14:58.565 --> 15:01.799
<i>He was still in,</i>
<i>uh, new york, and he said,</i>

15:01.801 --> 15:03.935
<i>I don't want to play</i>
<i>in this match</i>

15:03.937 --> 15:07.171
<i>'cause it's not enough</i>
<i>prize money.</i>

15:07.173 --> 15:08.706
<i>It's not enough!</i>

15:08.708 --> 15:10.008
<i>He was all talk.</i>

15:10.010 --> 15:13.444
<i>He wasn't, like,</i>
<i>ready to perform</i>

15:13.446 --> 15:14.979
<i>For, like, magic people.</i>

15:14.981 --> 15:21.152
<i>But he gets a phone call</i>
<i>from henry [bleep] kissinger,</i>

15:21.154 --> 15:24.322
<i>The secretary of state,</i>
<i>and he said,</i>

15:24.324 --> 15:28.593
<i>Uh...Hi, this is ken--</i>

15:28.595 --> 15:30.395
<i>This is henry kissinger</i>

15:30.397 --> 15:36.200
<i>Saying that you need to get</i>
<i>your butt over to iceland now.</i>

15:36.202 --> 15:38.569
<i>So he finally shows up</i>
<i>in iceland,</i>

15:38.571 --> 15:43.474
<i>And spassky's like, fine,</i>
<i>great, let's get started.</i>

15:43.476 --> 15:48.980
<i>But fischer was like,</i>
<i>there's too many cameras.</i>

15:48.982 --> 15:52.650
<i>There's, uh--</i>
<i>the audience is too close.</i>

15:52.652 --> 15:55.853
<i>The chess board is too shiny.</i>

15:55.855 --> 15:57.789
<i>The lights are shiny.</i>

15:57.791 --> 16:00.658
<i>But fischer</i>
<i>finally agreed to play,</i>

16:00.660 --> 16:04.595
<i>And in america</i>
<i>it was shown on bars</i>

16:04.597 --> 16:06.331
<i>Throughout the country.</i>

16:06.333 --> 16:08.466
<i>So you would go</i>
<i>into a bar,</i>

16:08.468 --> 16:13.271
You'd see chess and not
the new york mets,

16:13.273 --> 16:18.142
Not the...Klondike...Bars.

16:18.144 --> 16:20.912
- But what would you do
for a klondike?

16:20.914 --> 16:24.515
- I would do anything
for a klondike bar,

16:24.517 --> 16:29.854
Except wikipedia my dingus.

16:29.856 --> 16:32.190
- [laughs]

16:32.192 --> 16:34.625
- And so,
the world championship

16:34.627 --> 16:37.628
<i>Was a best out of 24 match.</i>

16:37.630 --> 16:39.063
<i>The first game was weird</i>

16:39.065 --> 16:42.000
<i>Because there's</i>
<i>cameras everywhere.</i>

16:42.002 --> 16:45.470
[whimpering gibberish]

16:45.472 --> 16:47.405
<i>It was like,</i>
<i>they're too close!</i>

16:47.407 --> 16:49.874
<i>And fischer made</i>
<i>a rookie move,</i>

16:49.876 --> 16:53.978
<i>Like, he went and got</i>
<i>an outlier pawn</i>

16:53.980 --> 16:54.812
<i>With his bishop,</i>

16:54.814 --> 16:59.384
<i>And spassky surrounded it</i>
<i>with his bishops.</i>

16:59.386 --> 17:00.451
<i>Whoa.</i>

17:00.453 --> 17:02.820
<i>And he lost big time.</i>

17:02.822 --> 17:07.725
<i>The second match came around,</i>
<i>and spassky was there,</i>

17:07.727 --> 17:09.527
<i>And he goes, where is he?</i>

17:09.529 --> 17:12.997
<i>Fischer was staying</i>
<i>in his room and saying,</i>

17:12.999 --> 17:17.368
<i>I will not go out</i>
<i>unless the cameras change.</i>

17:17.370 --> 17:20.772
<i>And he was thinking</i>
<i>that they would do it,</i>

17:20.774 --> 17:22.407
<i>But they didn't.</i>

17:22.409 --> 17:27.745
<i>And then fischer</i>
<i>forfeits the match.</i>

17:27.747 --> 17:28.980
<i>Hrrump!</i>

17:28.982 --> 17:30.615
<i>That's how they did it.</i>

17:30.617 --> 17:34.085
And he's down two-nothing,

17:34.087 --> 17:39.424
<i>Which is pretty [bleep] bad.</i>

17:39.426 --> 17:41.325
Pfft-pfft-pfft.

17:45.264 --> 17:47.565
- Why is all the ice gone?
Where did all the ice go?

17:47.567 --> 17:49.133
- I just want some free flowers.
What?

17:49.135 --> 17:52.236
- All the ice was put
into the cooler.

17:52.238 --> 17:54.172
- Let me tell you
about the ice.

17:54.174 --> 17:57.575
You just gotta mix it up!

17:57.577 --> 17:58.876
- Jeez.

17:58.878 --> 18:00.344
- Here's the thing.

18:00.346 --> 18:02.346
The thing is--
- here's the thing.

18:02.348 --> 18:05.550
- No, but what
the thing is, is, um,

18:05.552 --> 18:08.986
I have a flaming dick disease.

18:08.988 --> 18:10.154
[laughter]

18:10.156 --> 18:14.125
No, I was trying to say
that to be behind two-nothing

18:14.127 --> 18:16.494
Is a big deal
in these matches.

18:16.496 --> 18:18.830
<i>And then finally</i>
<i>for the third game</i>

18:18.832 --> 18:22.467
<i>Fischer said, look,</i>
<i>let's go to a back room</i>

18:22.469 --> 18:24.669
<i>With no cameras, please.</i>

18:24.671 --> 18:26.571
<i>And spassky said yes.</i>

18:26.573 --> 18:30.708
<i>Fischer felt comfortable</i>
<i>and won.</i>

18:30.710 --> 18:31.676
<i>He won!</i>

18:31.678 --> 18:36.013
<i>The first time he'd ever</i>
<i>beaten fas--fassko--</i>

18:36.015 --> 18:37.482
<i>No, spassky.</i>

18:37.484 --> 18:40.418
Once he won,
it just changed.

18:40.420 --> 18:41.486
<i>It's like a turnaround.</i>

18:41.488 --> 18:44.822
<i>It's like</i>
<i>a blip, blah, aghhhh.</i>

18:44.824 --> 18:45.890
<i>It's like a shhh.</i>

18:45.892 --> 18:48.426
<i>It's like a pup.</i>
<i>It's like a poosh.</i>

18:48.428 --> 18:52.163
<i>It's like a boo-laah!</i>

18:52.165 --> 18:54.065
<i>Like a put-chi-sha-sha-snoot!</i>

18:54.067 --> 18:55.099
<i>It happened.</i>

18:55.101 --> 18:57.668
<i>So fischer won</i>
<i>the third game,</i>

18:57.670 --> 18:59.770
<i>The fifth game,</i>
<i>the sixth game,</i>

18:59.772 --> 19:02.640
<i>The eighth game,</i>
<i>the tenth game.</i>

19:02.642 --> 19:04.408
It was so brilliant,

19:04.410 --> 19:06.611
Spassky actually stood up,

19:06.613 --> 19:08.880
<i>He gave a standing ovation.</i>

19:08.882 --> 19:10.748
<i>Thank you, thank you.</i>

19:10.750 --> 19:12.617
<i>And after the 13th game,</i>

19:12.619 --> 19:15.119
<i>The soviets were like,</i>
<i>what do we do?</i>

19:15.121 --> 19:17.522
<i>They went to the officials</i>
<i>and said,</i>

19:17.524 --> 19:22.560
<i>Bobby fischer is using</i>
<i>electronic devices</i>

19:22.562 --> 19:26.030
<i>To wane spassky's energy</i>

19:26.032 --> 19:28.432
<i>Through electronic</i>
<i>zappage.</i>

19:28.434 --> 19:32.937
<i>So the reykjavik police</i>
<i>from iceland</i>

19:32.939 --> 19:35.373
<i>Came in and took apart</i>
<i>everything.</i>

19:35.375 --> 19:38.709
<i>They took apart</i>
<i>bobby fischer's chair,</i>

19:38.711 --> 19:41.679
<i>Bobby fischer's, uh...</i>

19:41.681 --> 19:44.315
<i>Peanuts.</i>

19:44.317 --> 19:45.349
<i>Peanuts.</i>

19:45.351 --> 19:46.384
<i>And they were thinking,</i>

19:46.386 --> 19:48.186
<i>Oh, this is gonna</i>
<i>fluster fischer,</i>

19:48.188 --> 19:52.156
<i>Because fischer's very,</i>
<i>you know, tumultuous.</i>

19:52.158 --> 19:54.225
<i>It didn't at all.</i>

19:54.227 --> 19:55.426
<i>He loved it.</i>

19:55.428 --> 19:57.962
<i>And he won after that,</i>

19:57.964 --> 19:59.197
<i>And won and won,</i>

19:59.199 --> 20:03.067
<i>And pretty much</i>
<i>after the 21st match,</i>

20:03.069 --> 20:06.270
<i>It became</i>
<i>mathematically impossible</i>

20:06.272 --> 20:07.838
<i>For spassky to win.</i>

20:07.840 --> 20:11.142
<i>And it was like, oh, my god!</i>

20:11.144 --> 20:13.844
<i>Fischer wins!</i>
<i>Fischer wins!</i>

20:13.846 --> 20:14.779
<i>And it's--he--</i>

20:14.781 --> 20:17.381
<i>He's, like,</i>
<i>the world chess champion,</i>

20:17.383 --> 20:19.217
<i>And he's from the u.S.</i>

20:19.219 --> 20:21.152
<i>He walks out in reykjavik,</i>

20:21.154 --> 20:22.954
<i>There's people everywhere.</i>

20:22.956 --> 20:24.055
<i>He's mobbed.</i>

20:24.057 --> 20:26.190
<i>Fischer was huge,</i>

20:26.192 --> 20:28.859
<i>And he became</i>
<i>a cold war hero,</i>

20:28.861 --> 20:31.095
<i>And he felt like...</i>
