00:07.841 --> 00:09.610
‐ There's always a crisis.

00:09.643 --> 00:10.811
‐ I want him to be happy.

00:10.844 --> 00:13.013
‐ I've lost my love.
My job.

00:13.046 --> 00:15.616
‐ I know your code.
One I never should've broken
'cause of what it did to us.

00:15.649 --> 00:16.517
‐ My reflection.

00:16.550 --> 00:17.584
‐ You de‐vamped him?

00:17.618 --> 00:18.752
‐ I want a fresh start.

00:18.785 --> 00:20.821
‐ I've been meaning to
introduce myself. I'm Nicole.

00:20.854 --> 00:23.023
‐ I‐I owe you.
‐ Buy me that cup of coffee?

00:23.056 --> 00:23.924
I mean it.

00:25.058 --> 00:26.293
‐ I swear

00:26.326 --> 00:29.663
to be bound to the Ghost River
Triangle for all of my days.

00:29.696 --> 00:32.099
Everything I love
is already here.

00:32.132 --> 00:33.233
‐ You gonna marry me
or what?

00:33.267 --> 00:34.501
‐ Yes, please.

00:34.535 --> 00:35.602
‐ Let's have ourselves
a wedding!

00:37.671 --> 00:42.976
(slow 1950's style rock music)

00:43.010 --> 00:44.244
(woman whimpers)

00:44.278 --> 00:46.947
(she breathes heavily)

00:48.882 --> 00:51.385
(groaning)

00:51.418 --> 00:54.221
‐ What... what did you do?

00:54.254 --> 00:56.390
(screaming)

00:56.423 --> 00:57.457
(squelching)

00:57.491 --> 00:58.659
(soft thud)

01:07.401 --> 01:08.669
(gasping)

01:08.702 --> 01:09.570
(music stops)

01:09.603 --> 01:12.272
(bells ringing)

01:19.112 --> 01:22.316
(Waverly): It's here!
And just in time!

01:23.483 --> 01:25.285
(inhaling): Oh!

01:26.920 --> 01:28.956
My wedding dress!

01:33.160 --> 01:35.562
‐ You're getting married!
‐ I'm getting married!

01:35.596 --> 01:37.164
(both squeal)

01:37.197 --> 01:41.501
(theme music)

01:41.535 --> 01:44.705
♪ Cause I gave you
all I got to give ♪

01:44.738 --> 01:46.607
I know that ain't no way
to live ♪

01:46.640 --> 01:52.245
♪ I told that devil
to take you back ♪

01:52.279 --> 01:57.217
♪ I told that devil
to take you back ♪

01:58.151 --> 02:01.555
(pop music)

02:07.461 --> 02:10.263
(Wynonna): I knew it.
It's buttercream!

02:10.297 --> 02:13.567
Nicole? Does this look like
buttercream to you?

02:13.600 --> 02:15.435
‐ Which answer's gonna
make you less crazy?

02:15.469 --> 02:17.070
‐ The bride‐to‐be is vegan.
‐ Yep.

02:17.104 --> 02:18.305
(Wynonna): Buttercream's
not vegan.

02:18.338 --> 02:19.640
‐ Nope.

02:19.673 --> 02:21.208
‐ Ergo, Waverly can't eat
her own wedding cake!

02:21.241 --> 02:23.410
Meh. What if
we just didn't tell her?

02:23.443 --> 02:25.445
‐ This isn't
a secret wife, Nicole.

02:25.479 --> 02:28.181
This is the
matrimonial icing!

02:28.215 --> 02:30.684
(sighing): Wynonna, I know that

02:30.717 --> 02:33.353
you want everything to be
perfect but it's not gonna be.

02:33.387 --> 02:34.955
That's okay!
That's our brand!

02:34.988 --> 02:36.056
‐ Not today!

02:36.089 --> 02:40.360
‐ Look, this is us.
Trying to pull off a wedding.

02:40.394 --> 02:41.595
At the Homestead.

02:42.996 --> 02:45.732
‐ Both of Waverly's
dads died here.

02:46.400 --> 02:47.701
‐ Save something for
the wedding toast.

02:47.734 --> 02:49.336
(Waverly): Hi!

02:49.369 --> 02:53.173
‐ Hey, Waverly Earp.
I can't wait to be your wife.

02:53.206 --> 02:57.544
‐ Aw, I can't wait
to be your wife.

02:59.579 --> 03:01.481
‐ Nicole was gonna serve you
buttercream.

03:01.848 --> 03:04.418
‐ Huh?
‐ I was joking.

03:04.451 --> 03:05.986
It's basically hamburger.

03:06.019 --> 03:07.387
‐ There's vegan cupcakes
in the freezer.

03:07.421 --> 03:09.856
I made 'em yesterday.
Just in case.

03:09.890 --> 03:12.125
It'll be fine, sis.

03:12.159 --> 03:13.827
‐ Nicole gonna wear her hair
like that?

03:15.429 --> 03:17.297
(Nedley): You all packed?

03:17.330 --> 03:19.499
‐ I got my clothes, my pillow.

03:19.533 --> 03:20.801
‐ Have you thought
about your lures?

03:21.435 --> 03:26.807
‐ Nasty boys for pike and
jig spin for walleye.

03:26.840 --> 03:30.677
‐ Ah, we don't waste time on
walleye on my boat, little lady.

03:30.711 --> 03:33.380
‐ Honestly, I'll be happy
if I land a minnow.

03:33.413 --> 03:35.215
God, fishing!

03:35.248 --> 03:37.617
‐ You know I'm glad
you're excited.

03:37.651 --> 03:40.387
The only thing Chrissy
ever caught was mono.

03:40.420 --> 03:41.354
(blowing out air loudly)

03:41.388 --> 03:42.723
(magical chiming)

03:44.791 --> 03:46.460
(Wynonna): Oh my god.

03:53.834 --> 03:55.569
It's beautiful.

04:03.076 --> 04:05.112
What even would it feel like?

04:07.581 --> 04:11.451
(creaking and loud thud)

04:11.485 --> 04:13.553
It's summer, who needs doors?

04:13.587 --> 04:16.623
(suspenseful music)

04:18.959 --> 04:20.627
(frantically): Grab the crystal
water glasses off the cart

04:20.660 --> 04:21.795
before they break.

04:21.828 --> 04:24.264
Forget the glasses,
water the arbour!

04:25.265 --> 04:27.234
(grunting): That's definitely
not vegan!

04:30.403 --> 04:31.438
(loud knock)

04:31.471 --> 04:33.140
(panting)

04:37.944 --> 04:42.215
(magical, soft music)

04:42.249 --> 04:43.450
Little help?

04:48.054 --> 04:51.024
and it was jus

04:51.057 --> 04:53.360
‐ And I...
‐ You had put it on.

04:53.393 --> 04:56.096
Your sister's wedding dress.
On the day of her wedding.

04:57.631 --> 04:59.900
‐ And now I can't get it off.

05:01.268 --> 05:04.104
‐ Here's something to
help us brainstorm.

05:06.940 --> 05:08.275
(Wynonna sighs)

05:09.910 --> 05:11.878
Mmm, okay.

05:11.912 --> 05:13.914
Wedding speech not going well?

05:17.017 --> 05:18.118
(Doc): Oh.

05:19.753 --> 05:21.721
Sometimes it is hard to
find the right words.

05:21.755 --> 05:23.723
‐ If we don't get me
out of this dress,

05:23.757 --> 05:25.258
there won't be a wedding.

05:25.292 --> 05:29.162
‐ Getting you out of your
clothes used to be my specialty.

05:44.845 --> 05:46.847
Nary a zipper to be found.

05:48.882 --> 05:50.217
I could cut it along
this seam.

05:50.250 --> 05:52.052
Sew it back together and
no one would be the wiser.

05:52.085 --> 05:53.687
‐ You can sew?

05:53.720 --> 05:56.223
‐ Wynonna, some of my clothes
are 150 years old.

05:58.792 --> 06:00.160
‐ You look different.

06:08.168 --> 06:10.737
‐ These threads are enchanted.
I cannot cut through.

06:10.770 --> 06:11.805
(loud sob)

06:11.838 --> 06:12.973
(car horn honking)

06:13.006 --> 06:14.274
‐ Oh my god.
Someone's coming.

06:16.810 --> 06:17.978
Close the door!

06:25.418 --> 06:27.020
Waverly!

06:27.420 --> 06:28.955
(Waverly): Hey!

06:28.989 --> 06:31.324
‐ Shouldn't you be getting
ready for your nuptials?

06:31.358 --> 06:33.326
‐ Just running a few
little errands first.

06:33.360 --> 06:35.495
‐ So to what do I owe
the honour of this visit?

06:35.528 --> 06:37.097
(grunting softly)

06:40.400 --> 06:41.935
‐ Wyatt Earp's saddle.

06:42.836 --> 06:45.005
(Waverly): It took a while
to get it properly restored

06:45.038 --> 06:49.342
but... I should've given it
to you years ago.

06:49.376 --> 06:51.378
John Henry Holliday.

06:51.411 --> 06:53.813
You are a good person.

06:53.847 --> 06:58.818
Not perfect, but trying,
every day to be better.

06:59.619 --> 07:02.923
And that makes you the
best man I have ever known.

07:02.956 --> 07:04.491
And so...

07:04.524 --> 07:07.260
I'd like you to be mine.

07:07.294 --> 07:09.062
Today.

07:09.095 --> 07:10.230
My best man!

07:11.264 --> 07:12.432
‐ What about Wynonna?

07:12.465 --> 07:15.502
‐ Oh. She's standing up
for Nicole.

07:15.535 --> 07:17.537
Apparently, they're
best friends now.

07:17.570 --> 07:21.207
‐ I do not know what I did to
deserve your kindness.

07:21.241 --> 07:23.310
‐ Just say yes?

07:23.343 --> 07:25.145
I still have so much to do.

07:26.012 --> 07:28.748
‐ It would be my joy to stand by
your side

07:28.782 --> 07:30.784
and watch you marry
that formidable woman.

07:30.817 --> 07:32.752
‐ Yay!

07:33.820 --> 07:36.122
Okay. Then I'll see you
in a couple of hours.

07:36.156 --> 07:38.058
Can you believe
I'm getting married?

07:38.458 --> 07:42.095
Okay. Oops!
(Wynonna): Psssst!

07:44.664 --> 07:46.866
Ask her where she got the dress!

07:46.900 --> 07:49.069
‐ Oh, uh, Waverly!

07:49.102 --> 07:50.570
‐ Yeah?

07:50.603 --> 07:52.238
‐ Where did you buy
your wedding gown?

07:52.272 --> 07:54.908
Jeremy and I are looking to
procure matching cummerbunds.

07:54.941 --> 07:58.511
‐ Aw! I got it at this adorably
quaint little boutique

07:58.545 --> 08:00.213
down on
Hogback Road.

08:00.246 --> 08:02.882
‐ Did she say quaint or taint?

08:02.916 --> 08:05.018
‐ She does love her vintage.

08:09.289 --> 08:11.024
(clinking)

08:11.057 --> 08:14.928
(bird honking loudly)

08:14.961 --> 08:16.162
You're so goth.
We get it.

08:20.266 --> 08:21.868
(Doc sniffs)

08:39.819 --> 08:41.454
‐ Boo.
(Wynonna shrieks)

08:41.488 --> 08:42.455
Oh.

08:42.489 --> 08:44.958
I see my gown found you.

08:44.991 --> 08:46.459
‐ Yeah, my pee found your gown.

08:46.493 --> 08:48.428
‐ What are you supposed to be?

08:48.461 --> 08:51.131
Some kind of knight
in shining armour?

08:51.164 --> 08:53.166
A cowboy?

08:53.199 --> 08:56.836
‐ I am a gunslinger‐
‐ Okay, nobody cares.

08:57.270 --> 08:58.938
But you.
(Wynonna): Hm?

08:59.539 --> 09:04.577
‐ You are the perfect mark.

09:04.611 --> 09:06.413
‐ I am nobody's mark.

09:06.446 --> 09:08.281
I am Wynonna goddamn Earp.

09:08.314 --> 09:10.950
And you are gonna get this gown
off me

09:10.984 --> 09:13.253
before he blows your brains

09:13.286 --> 09:15.055
all over this bleak freak
boutique.

09:15.088 --> 09:17.457
‐ The dress will do its work,

09:17.490 --> 09:19.859
regardless of what you do to me.

09:21.227 --> 09:22.862
‐ Alright, just give
us the evil spiel.

09:22.896 --> 09:26.466
(ding! Ding!)
(singing in operatic voice)

09:26.499 --> 09:32.238
‐ When the wedding bells chime,

09:32.272 --> 09:37.544
the slaughter will begin.

09:37.577 --> 09:40.113
At the hand...

09:40.146 --> 09:41.881
‐ What is happening?
‐ ...of the one.

09:41.915 --> 09:48.154
(Doc): Slaughter?
‐ ...who wears it.

09:48.188 --> 09:49.322
‐ What I think she's saying is

09:49.355 --> 09:51.024
I'm gonna kill everyone at
the wedding.

09:51.057 --> 09:54.527
Well, bing bang boom,
we won't ring the bells.

09:54.561 --> 09:57.030
‐ Don't be so literal.

09:57.063 --> 09:58.331
It's gauche.

09:58.364 --> 10:00.967
‐ Oh, don't you gauche me
out of this. Now.

10:01.000 --> 10:06.005
‐ Oh! Only a Bombyx mori can
undo the thread it has spun.

10:07.407 --> 10:09.943
‐ Bombyx mori.
Silkworm.

10:09.976 --> 10:12.912
‐ Yeah, you know the one that
has the same pattern on its back

10:12.946 --> 10:14.147
as that one.

10:14.180 --> 10:15.415
‐ We're on the clock here

10:15.448 --> 10:17.250
I'm just gonna shoot you
and see how it goes.

10:17.283 --> 10:20.053
‐ Killing me won't stop
the coming bloodshed.

10:21.054 --> 10:22.489
‐ So how do we kill the dress?

10:22.522 --> 10:23.990
‐ You can't.

10:24.023 --> 10:28.061
Not without killing the
person who wears it.

10:29.095 --> 10:32.232
‐ Alrighty then.
(sighing)

10:32.265 --> 10:34.667
‐ Well, I guess we gotta find
some bugs and save a wedding.

10:34.701 --> 10:36.069
Bring it on.

10:36.102 --> 10:38.404
‐ I found the cake topper.

10:38.438 --> 10:40.106
(door opens)

10:40.140 --> 10:41.074
‐ Oh.

10:41.107 --> 10:42.142
(door closes)

10:42.175 --> 10:44.544
Oh.
‐ Mmm. Lesbian wedding.

10:44.577 --> 10:46.379
‐ Uh, guys?

10:46.412 --> 10:48.615
I misted this before I left!

10:48.648 --> 10:50.450
Why is everything frigged up?

10:50.483 --> 10:52.585
‐ Yeah. Things have kinda
gotten... Earped?

10:52.619 --> 10:54.554
‐ Yeah. Yeah,
it appears that way.

10:54.587 --> 10:58.224
‐ Well, who...
or what did this?

11:02.128 --> 11:03.229
‐ Don't worry, brides.

11:03.263 --> 11:05.765
I will get to the
bottom of this.

11:05.798 --> 11:09.369
‐ Didn't the barn used
to have a door? Look!

11:10.303 --> 11:13.473
(sighing)
Baby! Of all the days!

11:13.506 --> 11:16.142
‐ You really thought we wouldn't
know, didn't you?

11:16.176 --> 11:17.243
‐ Uh. What?

11:17.277 --> 11:20.413
‐ Hm. Damon, really?
Isn't that a little on the nose?

11:20.446 --> 11:21.381
‐ What nose?

11:21.414 --> 11:22.982
(sighing): Oh my gosh.

11:23.016 --> 11:25.585
This is a wedding. A day when
we celebrate love not...

11:25.618 --> 11:27.120
this.

11:27.153 --> 11:28.254
‐ Wow.

11:28.288 --> 11:29.389
‐ Wynonna?

11:30.990 --> 11:32.759
‐ Not here.
(Waverly gasps)

11:32.792 --> 11:35.128
‐ Neither is my wedding dress!

11:35.161 --> 11:37.263
Wait. I don't even like
that dress.

11:37.297 --> 11:39.666
‐ And everything wedding‐y
is trashed.

11:40.667 --> 11:42.769
(both): Haunted wedding dress!

11:42.802 --> 11:44.304
(whispering): I know
your secret.

11:44.337 --> 11:46.306
‐ It's not a secret, man.

11:46.339 --> 11:48.074
(chuckling): Okay, great.

11:48.107 --> 11:49.175
Can we just have one day

11:49.209 --> 11:51.511
where your kind isn't being
shoved in our faces?

11:51.544 --> 11:52.612
‐ My kind?

11:52.645 --> 11:54.280
‐ Yeah.
Damon.

11:54.314 --> 11:56.683
‐ So, you'd prefer no gays at
the gay wedding

11:56.716 --> 11:58.284
which you of all people
are officiating.

11:58.318 --> 12:01.254
‐ Oh my god, okay, let me guess,
you were born that way?

12:01.287 --> 12:03.423
Yeah, demon. Wait.
Sorry, gay demon?

12:03.456 --> 12:06.826
‐ Demon? Alright, I'm gonna
go away from you

12:06.859 --> 12:09.495
while you sort out whatever it
is you need sorting out.

12:09.529 --> 12:12.131
And you don't get any pinwheels.

12:12.165 --> 12:15.501
‐ Hey! The second I saw you
I had a feeling in my crotch!

12:16.536 --> 12:18.538
‐ For Waverly!
‐ Okay.

12:20.406 --> 12:22.308
‐ Ooh, mama!

12:27.814 --> 12:28.815
Did you get it?

12:32.552 --> 12:37.023
‐ Well, if by "it"
you mean E. Coli, then probably.

12:40.960 --> 12:43.696
You know it is entirely
possible

12:43.730 --> 12:48.167
that there are no silkworms in
the entire Ghost River Triangle.

12:49.435 --> 12:52.405
Where did you, uh...
Wynonna.

12:54.741 --> 12:56.242
‐ Are you serious
with this shit?

12:56.809 --> 12:59.178
‐ The fog is gone.
Amon is gone.

12:59.212 --> 13:03.483
BBD is no longer a threat and
I am back to being just a man.

13:05.385 --> 13:06.419
‐ Just?

13:07.553 --> 13:09.188
‐ You're skipping town

13:09.222 --> 13:10.757
and you were gonna tell me
in a fucking note?

13:19.332 --> 13:21.267
actually has a buttload of
weddings

13:21.301 --> 13:22.268
that ended
in bloodshed.

13:22.302 --> 13:24.704
‐ When your town has forty times

13:24.737 --> 13:26.806
the murder rate of
a normal borough,

13:26.839 --> 13:30.143
you don't always
connect the dots.

13:30.176 --> 13:32.045
Here's another one. 1968.

13:32.078 --> 13:35.081
The bride axed her groom to
death on the foot of the chapel

13:35.114 --> 13:37.016
right after she'd‐‐
‐ Just axed her family to death?

13:40.286 --> 13:41.721
Then killed herself?

13:41.754 --> 13:43.690
‐ Slit her throat.
‐ With the axe!

13:43.723 --> 13:45.224
‐ Wanna see her
beautiful wedding dress?

13:45.258 --> 13:46.225
‐ Ooh, wait, don't tell me.

13:46.259 --> 13:50.263
Vintage lace, inlaid
sapphires in a heart?

13:50.296 --> 13:50.997
‐ Bingo.

13:51.030 --> 13:52.932
‐ We know the dress is
haunted,

13:52.965 --> 13:54.701
so it's gotta be the
dressmaker, right?

13:55.134 --> 13:57.370
‐ There's an old wedding
announcement. Check this out.

13:59.005 --> 14:00.840
"The bride will be wearing
a creation

14:00.873 --> 14:02.709
from Cursey's Bridal Boutique,

14:02.742 --> 14:05.845
designed by
Ms. Brigitte Hogback.

14:05.878 --> 14:08.514
‐ That's definitely the weirdo
who sold me the dress.

14:08.548 --> 14:10.149
Also!

14:12.952 --> 14:15.288
First wedding massacre, 1922.

14:15.321 --> 14:17.423
Ah! A Miss H,

14:17.457 --> 14:20.360
left at the altar,
killed her guests.

14:20.393 --> 14:23.029
‐ Well, that is a terrible
way to be dunked on.

14:23.062 --> 14:24.731
‐ Awful enough to want to

14:24.764 --> 14:26.833
destroy every future wedding
in town?

14:26.866 --> 14:29.335
‐ Baby, if you left me at
the altar, I would fuck shit up.

14:29.369 --> 14:30.536
I might kill Nedley.

14:30.570 --> 14:33.172
‐ Nicole!
‐ I'm kidding.

14:33.206 --> 14:34.507
I think.

14:34.540 --> 14:38.077
‐ What else would you do
to keep me around?

14:40.346 --> 14:43.549
‐ You cut and run on Wyatt.
You cut and run on Kate.

14:43.583 --> 14:44.884
God, her shit's still
in your car!

14:44.917 --> 14:46.419
‐ That is your shit.

14:46.452 --> 14:47.754
‐ I guess I shouldn't be
surprised

14:47.787 --> 14:48.921
you'd cut and run
on me too.

14:48.955 --> 14:50.223
On us.

14:51.524 --> 14:52.825
‐ Look, if you could park your
temper for even one minute‐‐

14:52.859 --> 14:54.861
‐ Why, so you can explain?

14:54.894 --> 14:57.530
We count on you. And you were
just gonna drive off in Charlene

14:57.563 --> 14:58.998
and go find a new family?

14:59.031 --> 15:00.833
‐ You think so little of me?

15:00.867 --> 15:02.201
‐ Yeah, well, that's the thing
with you, right?

15:02.235 --> 15:04.036
You get us all to believe
you can be better.

15:04.070 --> 15:07.907
That you're better.
And you're just a coward.

15:07.940 --> 15:09.809
‐ A coward would stay.

15:09.842 --> 15:12.245
Instead of admitting it is
high time to let go of the past

15:12.278 --> 15:13.913
and get to living.

15:13.946 --> 15:16.182
And as far as dastards go,
you are one to talk.

15:16.215 --> 15:17.984
‐ What is that supposed
to mean?

15:18.017 --> 15:20.019
‐ In war, you are
the truest hero

15:20.052 --> 15:22.822
I ever fought
alongside of.

15:22.855 --> 15:26.025
But in love, Wynonna,
you are a coward.

15:30.129 --> 15:31.097
You don't know me.

15:31.130 --> 15:35.401
‐ I know you as sure
as I know my own heart.

15:38.271 --> 15:41.007
And I wasn't just gonna
leave a letter.

15:41.040 --> 15:43.309
I was just trying to find
the right words to say.

15:48.815 --> 15:50.216
Prove me wrong.

15:52.351 --> 15:53.419
Come with me.

15:56.456 --> 15:57.990
We don't have time
for this shit.

15:58.024 --> 15:59.926
If we don't get me out of
this dress,

15:59.959 --> 16:00.960
it'll be
"here comes the scythe".

16:02.161 --> 16:03.529
So that's that?

16:04.464 --> 16:07.300
Shut up and help me
paint some grubs.

16:07.333 --> 16:08.100
‐ Hello?

16:08.134 --> 16:10.169
(Waverly): Oh! Crap!
‐ Oh, my God!

16:10.203 --> 16:12.939
Guys, for the last time,
nobody wants to see this.

16:12.972 --> 16:14.006
‐ Sorry, Jer.

16:14.040 --> 16:15.975
We figured out what happened and
then we sort of...

16:16.008 --> 16:17.276
‐ The spirit took us.

16:17.310 --> 16:19.145
‐ Oh, okay.
So you know about the‐

16:19.178 --> 16:20.646
(both): Haunted wedding dress?

16:20.680 --> 16:23.182
‐ Wh‐‐ Uh, no.
You mean the demon caterer?

16:23.216 --> 16:24.851
‐ Uh, no.

16:24.884 --> 16:25.918
(Nicole exhales loudly)
Check the murder‐board.

16:25.952 --> 16:28.287
‐ Yeah, but if you're talking
about our caterer,

16:28.321 --> 16:30.456
his name's Damon
and he's pretty great.

16:30.490 --> 16:31.624
‐ Super hot, right?

16:31.657 --> 16:35.294
‐ Yes. Definitely hot.
And gay!

16:35.328 --> 16:36.262
‐ It went that well, huh?

16:36.295 --> 16:37.997
‐ Ugh, No!

16:38.030 --> 16:39.632
‐ Sorry, Jerbear!

16:39.665 --> 16:43.536
(sighing contentedly)
I gotta go.

16:43.569 --> 16:45.538
‐ Hey, baby.
Heads up.

16:45.571 --> 16:47.406
‐ You sure you got this?

16:47.440 --> 16:49.342
‐ I'll make sand out
of that witch!

16:49.375 --> 16:50.543
‐ Nice one.

16:53.212 --> 16:54.480
‐ Bye.

16:55.381 --> 16:58.518
(Nicole): Oof!
Okay.

16:58.551 --> 17:01.020
‐ Are you sure he's not
a demon?

17:03.155 --> 17:05.858
‐ I gotta fix my hair.
Again.

17:08.694 --> 17:10.129
‐ They're in here?

17:10.162 --> 17:12.632
‐ Your cup runneth over
with silkworms.

17:12.665 --> 17:15.935
‐ But how? They're not endemic
to the region.

17:15.968 --> 17:18.604
‐ Amazon Prime same day, baby.
Now de‐dressify me.

17:23.209 --> 17:25.044
‐ Oh! Common Earth worms.

17:25.077 --> 17:27.647
(chuckling): Did you even try?

17:27.680 --> 17:29.649
‐ Have you painted a bug before?

17:29.682 --> 17:33.553
‐ If this is your best effort,
I'd rather not see what's next.

17:33.586 --> 17:35.187
‐ Now, listen here, ma'am.

17:35.221 --> 17:38.991
Yes, that is a tumbler of grubs
covered in nail polish.

17:39.025 --> 17:40.560
But it is symbolic of
the great effort

17:40.593 --> 17:43.095
that Wynonna puts into
keeping her family safe.

17:43.129 --> 17:44.363
‐ Hm.
That's actually kinda sweet.

17:44.397 --> 17:48.034
‐ What you have here
is a cup of love.

17:48.067 --> 17:50.002
‐ Scratch that.

17:50.036 --> 17:54.607
‐ Well, love is not enough to
stop your descent

17:54.640 --> 17:56.976
into a murderous fever.

17:57.009 --> 18:02.081
Your failure has
sealed... your fate.

18:02.114 --> 18:05.251
‐ Failure is never irreversible
and I'm living proof of that.

18:05.284 --> 18:07.453
And if I have to paint every
damn maggot on the continent

18:07.486 --> 18:11.157
to give Waverly the perfect
wedding day then I will.

18:11.190 --> 18:14.226
‐ Sorry, um, whose
wedding day is this?

18:16.729 --> 18:18.130
‐ Hi, guys!

18:18.164 --> 18:20.266
(both women screaming
indistinctly)

18:20.299 --> 18:21.400
Wynonna!

18:21.434 --> 18:22.535
‐ What is she doing here?

18:22.568 --> 18:23.970
‐ Do you think she saw
the dress?

18:24.003 --> 18:24.971
(screaming)

18:25.004 --> 18:27.506
‐ That was such a rush!

18:27.540 --> 18:29.175
‐ That was remarkably easy.

18:29.208 --> 18:31.077
‐ I cannot believe that I jumped
into a swamp

18:31.110 --> 18:32.778
when we could have
just done that.

18:32.812 --> 18:38.284
‐ I was bested by regular silk
and a standard removal spell.

18:38.317 --> 18:39.452
‐ So can I shoot her now?

18:39.485 --> 18:41.153
‐ No!
‐ I agree with the new girl.

18:41.187 --> 18:44.256
‐ No killing on my wedding day!

18:44.290 --> 18:45.257
‐ It's your wedding day?

18:45.291 --> 18:46.292
‐ Yeah.

18:47.660 --> 18:49.462
Are you two lesbians?

18:49.495 --> 18:52.765
‐ Bisexual.
‐ No, we are sisters.

18:52.798 --> 18:53.766
Oh, and you're getting married?

18:53.799 --> 18:54.967
(both): No!

18:54.967 --> 18:58.104
(sighing): She is marrying
the Sheriff, who is a lesbian.

18:58.137 --> 19:02.341
‐ Then why was the aggressive
one in your wedding dress?

19:02.375 --> 19:06.712
‐ You know what,
great question, silk witch.

19:06.746 --> 19:08.648
‐ Because it was a magic dress.
Tell 'em, Hogback.

19:08.681 --> 19:11.384
‐ No, the dress does not choose.

19:11.417 --> 19:13.386
The chooser chooses.

19:14.654 --> 19:16.222
‐ Throw me a frickin' bone, man.

19:16.255 --> 19:18.057
‐ As long as the chooser
is in love.

19:18.090 --> 19:19.392
‐ Really?

19:19.425 --> 19:23.329
‐ I saw the dress hanging in
the barn and I know it's stupid.

19:23.362 --> 19:25.164
But just for a minute,

19:25.197 --> 19:28.234
I wanted to pretend I could be
that kind of normal

19:28.267 --> 19:31.771
and have
that kind of... love.

19:34.206 --> 19:37.643
‐ We have a...
complicated history.

19:37.677 --> 19:40.212
‐ Okay. You want to know
complicated?

19:41.113 --> 19:44.150
This woman was left
at the altar.

19:44.650 --> 19:47.753
I'm so sorry that happened
to you, Brigitte.

19:48.688 --> 19:50.523
Everyone deserves love.

19:55.361 --> 19:56.629
(Wynonna): Mama's dress.

19:56.662 --> 19:58.230
‐ Feels right,

19:59.598 --> 20:02.168
with a few
Waverly modifications.

20:02.201 --> 20:03.335
‐ Hm.

20:04.770 --> 20:06.539
‐ Do you think Mama
would approve?

20:06.572 --> 20:08.708
‐ I think Mama's banging
her way through Turkey.

20:09.442 --> 20:11.510
Postcards have gotten
real graphic.

20:11.544 --> 20:13.145
(Waverly): Hm.

20:13.179 --> 20:15.214
(Wynonna exhales at length)

20:15.247 --> 20:16.749
‐ Wynonna?
‐ Hm?

20:19.518 --> 20:20.553
‐ What is it?

20:20.586 --> 20:22.688
‐ Oh, you know.

20:22.722 --> 20:24.490
My baby sister's
getting married.

20:38.804 --> 20:40.606
(knocking at the door,
door opens)

20:40.639 --> 20:42.875
‐ Oh, hi.

20:43.876 --> 20:48.414
‐
Wow. I never knew a woman could
look so beautiful in a suit.

20:48.447 --> 20:50.883
‐ Took some work to get the
barn sex out of my hair, but...

20:50.916 --> 20:52.518
‐ Hm.

20:52.551 --> 20:54.520
‐ Sorry.

20:54.553 --> 20:56.856
Turns out, I'm a little nervous.

20:56.889 --> 21:00.292
‐ I... know I'm not supposed to
interrupt the bride

21:00.326 --> 21:01.160
while she's getting ready

21:01.193 --> 21:03.729
but I thought this might
come in handy.

21:03.763 --> 21:04.663
‐ Ah.

21:06.565 --> 21:07.800
Thank you.

21:09.368 --> 21:10.536
But I need one more thing.

21:10.569 --> 21:12.371
‐ Okay.

21:14.440 --> 21:15.941
Will you walk me down the aisle?

21:17.910 --> 21:22.581
It would just really help
if you would walk beside me,

21:24.750 --> 21:27.386
like you've been doing
for most of my life.

21:27.820 --> 21:30.890
(soft music)

21:30.923 --> 21:32.358
‐ It would be my honour.

21:37.663 --> 21:40.666
Now, pull it together, Sheriff,

21:42.701 --> 21:44.603
let's go get you hitched.

22:36.689 --> 22:38.657
‐ You're the best of
us, baby girl.

22:39.391 --> 22:41.327
‐ I love you too, sis.

22:51.003 --> 22:52.571
‐ You look so beautiful.

22:52.605 --> 22:54.673
‐ Haught as hell.

22:55.975 --> 22:57.509
Please be seated.

23:02.681 --> 23:05.551
We are here today to celebrate
the union of

23:05.584 --> 23:06.986
Waverly Earp and
Nicole Haught.

23:07.019 --> 23:08.654
Two elements,

23:08.687 --> 23:14.193
maybe working in a bar or
small town police department,

23:14.226 --> 23:18.397
just minding their own business
when one day, boom:

23:18.430 --> 23:19.665
they connect.

23:19.698 --> 23:22.368
And if the right amount of
magic is involved,

23:22.401 --> 23:25.004
they become something stronger
than they were before.

23:25.804 --> 23:27.673
They become love.

23:27.706 --> 23:30.709
Please hold hands
and say your vows.

23:40.119 --> 23:41.720
(Jeremy, sighing): Nicole?

23:42.554 --> 23:44.123
‐ My beautiful angel.

23:44.156 --> 23:50.729
You are the smartest, and
the kindest person I know.

23:51.830 --> 23:57.937
I promise to stand by your side
for all of life's adventures,

23:57.970 --> 24:00.873
and always pack a safety
harness, just in case.

24:00.906 --> 24:02.741
(giggling)

24:03.575 --> 24:05.811
I promise to hold your hand

24:05.844 --> 24:07.780
when the firelight grows dim

24:09.815 --> 24:11.784
and that my love never will.

24:13.118 --> 24:14.586
I love you.

24:15.154 --> 24:16.522
(sighing)

24:23.896 --> 24:25.030
‐ Waverly?

24:27.700 --> 24:32.738
Nicole, I thank goodness
every day

24:32.771 --> 24:34.773
for that
bullet‐proof vest.

24:34.807 --> 24:36.575
Without it,

24:36.608 --> 24:42.481
I would never have known
a love so strong...

24:42.514 --> 24:44.483
and mighty.

24:45.684 --> 24:47.619
I promise to love you.

24:49.121 --> 24:51.657
I promise to stand beside you,

24:52.858 --> 24:53.959
as equals,

24:55.894 --> 24:58.097
for the rest of our lives.

25:16.148 --> 25:19.952
‐ Waverly, do you promise to
love and respect Nicole

25:19.985 --> 25:22.154
for as long as
you both shall live?

25:22.187 --> 25:23.288
‐ I do.

25:23.322 --> 25:26.992
‐ Nicole, do you promise to love
and respect Waverly

25:27.026 --> 25:29.028
for as long as
you both shall live?

25:29.061 --> 25:30.629
‐ I do.

25:31.764 --> 25:35.501
‐ Then I now pronounce
you, wife and wife.

25:35.534 --> 25:37.669
You may now kiss the bride.

25:40.305 --> 25:41.140
‐ Opa!

25:41.173 --> 25:44.009
(all): Opa!

25:48.881 --> 25:50.549
Hey!

25:53.218 --> 25:54.653
Whoo!

25:55.187 --> 25:57.689
‐ Um. I've never been to
a wedding before.

25:59.058 --> 26:02.628
I hadn't done a lot of things,
before I met you...

26:02.661 --> 26:04.096
heroes.

26:05.631 --> 26:08.167
And now I feel like
I can do anything.

26:08.200 --> 26:11.837
But this is about
Waverly and Nicole.

26:11.870 --> 26:13.872
I didn't know what
to get you guys,

26:13.906 --> 26:16.175
so I got you this.

26:16.208 --> 26:19.845

(chuckling)

27:14.900 --> 27:15.767
My ginger bitch!

27:15.801 --> 27:16.969

I'm so glad you finally found
someone worthy of you.

‐ Yeah.

27:36.288 --> 27:38.123
Um, so...
‐ Maybe?

27:38.157 --> 27:40.125
‐ Wow.

27:40.159 --> 27:42.794
You two work out this whole
presentation ahead of time?

27:42.828 --> 27:43.962
‐ Please, Randy?

27:43.996 --> 27:46.899
(sighing): Okay. He can come.

27:46.932 --> 27:48.066
But...

27:50.302 --> 27:52.771
there's only gonna be
one kind of tent we're pitching

27:52.804 --> 27:53.539

28:50.395 --> 28:51.530
(he snaps his fingers)

28:51.563 --> 28:53.098
I just wanna apologize.

28:53.131 --> 28:54.166
‐ For trying to out me?

28:54.199 --> 28:56.902
Or for accusing me of being
some sort of demon?

28:56.969 --> 28:58.337
‐ Yes?

28:58.370 --> 29:01.873
‐ Okay, well, grab the other
side of this.

29:03.308 --> 29:04.810
I didn't say stop?

29:07.312 --> 29:10.349
‐ Look, I wasn't gonna out you.

29:10.382 --> 29:11.984
‐ I'm already out.

29:12.017 --> 29:13.385
‐ Oh, cool, same.

29:13.418 --> 29:15.487
I'm in the same out‐ness
as you.

29:15.520 --> 29:16.955
(Damon chuckles)

29:16.989 --> 29:20.392
‐ You share the same terrible,
demonic secret?

29:20.425 --> 29:22.294
‐ Yeah. Enthusiastically.

29:23.328 --> 29:26.498
‐ Well, obviously something was
weird here today,

29:26.531 --> 29:28.367
but apology accepted.

29:28.400 --> 29:31.036
I'm Bunny Loblaw's nephew.
‐ Ah.

29:31.069 --> 29:32.771
‐ My forgiveness muscle
is taut as hell.

29:32.804 --> 29:33.472
(chuckles)

29:34.406 --> 29:37.009
‐ Cool, well, uh,
it's great to meet you.

29:37.042 --> 29:39.177
Gay you... later.

29:39.211 --> 29:40.512
‐ Wait.
‐ Yeah?

29:40.545 --> 29:42.014
‐ What was that thing about you

29:42.047 --> 29:44.049
feeling something in your crotch
when you saw me?

29:44.082 --> 29:47.085
‐ No, uh, no, that's
like a long story.

29:47.119 --> 29:49.388
No, not that long.
Just like average size.

29:49.421 --> 29:50.389
(cell phone ringtone)

29:50.422 --> 29:52.291
‐ Relax.

29:52.324 --> 29:53.759
You had me at enthusiastic.

29:55.527 --> 29:56.962
Why don't we start over?

29:56.995 --> 29:59.231
Drinks?
Tomorrow night?

29:59.264 --> 30:00.165
‐ Uh.

30:00.198 --> 30:02.367
‐ You should probably
actually get that.

30:02.401 --> 30:04.536
‐ Yeah, sorry.

30:04.569 --> 30:07.072
Hello, what is so
goddamn important?

30:07.105 --> 30:09.875
(woman): Deputy Chief Chetri?
‐ No, it's Agent Chetri.

30:09.908 --> 30:11.043
‐ Not anymore.

30:11.076 --> 30:12.077
Black Badge needs you back

30:13.478 --> 30:14.413
and running the whole
Ghost River Triangle.

30:14.980 --> 30:15.614
First thing Monday.

30:15.647 --> 30:20.452
‐ I, um, I can't do Monday.

30:20.485 --> 30:21.853
I have a date.

30:23.889 --> 30:25.991
‐ Well, congratulations.

30:26.024 --> 30:28.794
On all of it.
See you Tuesday.

30:38.804 --> 30:40.806
‐ Alright, we get it.

30:40.839 --> 30:42.841
You're a good poker player.

30:45.143 --> 30:47.446
Starting to think you're
not bluffing.

30:48.413 --> 30:51.616
‐ I have to move forward.
My spurs are covered in dust.

30:55.821 --> 30:58.156
Besides I wanna see the
Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

31:00.225 --> 31:02.861
‐ What do you w‐‐ do
you want me to beg?

31:05.430 --> 31:07.599
‐ That is beneath us both.

31:10.902 --> 31:12.237
Maybe a little.

31:22.180 --> 31:24.483
I told you a lie when
we first met.

31:25.884 --> 31:28.854
All those years at the
bottom of a well.

31:28.887 --> 31:31.390
Yes, vengeance drove
my thinking.

31:31.423 --> 31:33.592
Kept me alive, and
gave me a purpose.

31:34.659 --> 31:37.696
But when it was dark and I was
scared,

31:37.729 --> 31:42.100
and I have been scared
for a long time, Wynonna,

31:44.336 --> 31:46.204
I mostly thought about love.

31:49.007 --> 31:50.175
They say life is short.

31:50.208 --> 31:52.644
But it is long.
And it is lonely.

31:52.677 --> 31:55.914
So if you manage to find a group
of souls who will tolerate you

31:57.382 --> 31:59.184
and elevate you,

32:01.052 --> 32:02.387
Oh, and one...

32:04.389 --> 32:07.225
and one who will especially
love you.

32:08.593 --> 32:10.929
Well, that is all it's about.

32:12.531 --> 32:14.266
That is what the fight
is really for.

32:14.299 --> 32:16.001
‐ Please.

32:22.040 --> 32:24.042
I can't leave her.

32:30.115 --> 32:32.451
‐ Then you do know
of what I speak.

32:35.086 --> 32:37.622
‐ I keep telling you
we're the same.

32:41.059 --> 32:43.094
You are without a doubt
the best Earp

32:43.128 --> 32:46.298
that I have ever
had the privilege of calling...

32:46.331 --> 32:47.566
friend.

32:52.204 --> 32:56.241
(soft music)

32:59.277 --> 33:00.946
‐ Doc!

33:06.284 --> 33:07.953
I'm sorry.

33:09.354 --> 33:11.223
For all the ways I hurt you.

33:14.192 --> 33:17.095
‐ We only ever really hurt
ourselves, Wynonna.

33:19.464 --> 33:21.633
I wouldn't have changed a note.

33:47.225 --> 33:48.093
‐ I did.

33:48.126 --> 33:49.394
‐ To Doc Holliday.

33:49.427 --> 33:50.595
The Doc Holliday.

33:50.629 --> 33:52.631
Was he not wearing his hat?

33:52.664 --> 33:54.566
‐ He has changed.

33:54.599 --> 33:56.535
But also done some like
terrible things.

33:56.568 --> 33:58.637
(Rachel): So have you. To Doc.
‐ Yes, I know,

33:58.670 --> 34:00.071
but I don't
have to sleep with him.

34:00.105 --> 34:01.039
(Rachel and Jeremy): Have to?

34:01.072 --> 34:02.974
‐ Guys, it's for the best.
(Nicole): Yeah.

34:03.008 --> 34:04.676
You two have always been‐‐
‐ Extremely hot.

34:04.709 --> 34:05.677
‐ Fraught.

34:06.978 --> 34:08.113
Toxic?

34:08.146 --> 34:10.048
‐ My fourth favourite
Britney song.

34:10.081 --> 34:12.350
What are we talking about?

34:12.384 --> 34:14.686
Whoa! You better hurry,
you're gonna miss him!

34:15.554 --> 34:17.255
‐ Wynonna turned Doc down.

34:17.289 --> 34:18.223
‐ Doc Holliday?

34:18.256 --> 34:19.591
‐ I am the Earp heir.

34:19.624 --> 34:21.726
I'm the only one who
can wield Peacemaker.

34:21.760 --> 34:23.728
I can't leave the
Ghost River Triangle.

34:23.762 --> 34:26.264
‐ Uh, the fuck you can't.

34:26.298 --> 34:27.532
‐ Ow! Waverly!

34:27.566 --> 34:28.700
‐ Don't you "ow" me.

34:28.733 --> 34:30.235
And you lot.

34:30.268 --> 34:33.672
Letting Wynonna mess up
her life, again, for us!

34:33.705 --> 34:36.408
Fuck you, fuck you,
fuck you, fuck you!

34:36.441 --> 34:37.342
Not you, sweetie pie.

34:37.375 --> 34:38.410
‐ Waverly.
‐ Nope!

34:38.443 --> 34:42.280
‐ Ow, ow, ow, okay, ow!

34:42.948 --> 34:46.384
Ow, ow, ow, ow!

34:46.418 --> 34:48.086
‐ What do we got here?

34:48.119 --> 34:49.187
‐ What are you doing?

34:49.220 --> 34:50.255
‐ Okay.

34:50.288 --> 34:51.389
‐ What're you in my nick‐nacks
for?

34:51.423 --> 34:55.327
How do you have like 72 bras and
one pair of panties?

34:55.360 --> 34:57.495
‐ Waverly. I am... not going.

34:59.030 --> 34:59.764
‐ Wynonna Earp.

34:59.798 --> 35:01.333
Do you want to go?

35:02.500 --> 35:05.670
‐ I want to protect you.
(Waverly scoffs)

35:05.704 --> 35:07.639
‐ No. Do not put this
on me.

35:07.672 --> 35:08.573
‐ Waverly‐‐

35:09.407 --> 35:11.409
(sighing): You need to
stop thinking

35:11.443 --> 35:13.578
you're the only person
who can handle this place.

35:13.612 --> 35:16.648
You need to stop acting
like you're alone!

35:17.282 --> 35:20.151
And you need to stop
punishing yourself.

35:22.621 --> 35:24.756
Okay.
‐ But, Peacemaker.

35:24.789 --> 35:26.458
And...
‐ Put them on.

35:26.491 --> 35:29.327
‐ The whole...
the whole thing.

35:29.361 --> 35:32.797
‐ Nicole is the Angel's Shield
and the Sheriff.

35:32.831 --> 35:35.367
She's gonna do things
differently this time.

35:35.400 --> 35:38.570
Humans, demons

35:38.603 --> 35:42.173
we all have to figure out a way
to live here together.

35:43.475 --> 35:45.477
Oh, and Jeremy's the new

35:45.510 --> 35:47.646
Deputy Director of
Black Badge now!

35:47.679 --> 35:49.581
(softly): Wow. Go Jer.

35:50.682 --> 35:52.150
‐ We'll be okay, Wynonna.

35:54.686 --> 35:57.322
‐ Henry and I are not
always good together.

35:57.355 --> 35:59.524
‐ Yeah, it's been messy.

36:01.726 --> 36:02.794
But you love him.

36:04.596 --> 36:07.065
‐ Oh fuck, I do.

36:12.237 --> 36:15.774
‐ That cowboy became
a cow‐man for you.

36:16.775 --> 36:17.776
He's tried.

36:19.044 --> 36:20.645
Now, it's your turn,
Wynonna.

36:23.481 --> 36:27.519
My biggest fear
used to be that you'd...

36:28.386 --> 36:30.255
(voice trembling): ...that
you'd never come back.

36:32.357 --> 36:35.060
That you'd never get
to know the real me.

36:36.728 --> 36:40.331
But now I know, you always
will, Wynonna.

36:40.365 --> 36:43.601
Not only because you're
the fucking hero we need.

36:43.635 --> 36:46.171
When we need you.

36:46.204 --> 36:48.573
But because this is your home.

36:49.741 --> 36:52.077
It says so, right out there
on the mailbox.

37:00.385 --> 37:04.189
‐ You're my whole heart,
Waverly.

37:06.291 --> 37:09.127
‐ We have cell phones,
ding dong.

37:11.296 --> 37:13.298
‐ Yeah! Yes!
(cheering)

37:13.331 --> 37:15.333
‐ Okay, I can give you
a police escort!

37:15.366 --> 37:18.169
‐ Well, I'm more worried
about...

37:18.903 --> 37:21.506
(truck rumbling)

37:21.539 --> 37:23.241
Perfect timing, old girl.

37:23.274 --> 37:24.476
‐ No!

37:24.509 --> 37:25.677
‐ Jeremy! Less screaming!

37:25.710 --> 37:27.312
Nedley! Get the jumper cables!
‐ Alright!

37:27.345 --> 37:29.347

He's almost at the border!

37:31.316 --> 37:32.684
‐ You installed a tracker
on Doc's phone?

37:32.717 --> 37:35.253
‐ Yeah! I didn't want to miss
when he posts his first TikTok.

37:35.286 --> 37:36.788
Plus I worry that
he drives too fast.

37:37.655 --> 37:38.757

60 in a 55 zone.

that I loved about this,

44:49.654 --> 44:51.656
the way it was written,

44:51.656 --> 44:53.658

you might think that

Waverly would have been the one

who was fretting,

of the episode,

because it's, like, funny

but it's also just,
first of all, unexpected that

45:14.545 --> 45:16.781
Wynonna would be the one
freaking out, but also,

45:16.781 --> 45:18.716

bad there, and so

everything must go perfectly.

Like, take no chances.

for her. It's, like,

45:47.245 --> 45:50.014
someone who probably never
pictured being married at all,

45:50.014 --> 45:52.416
and then in that moment,
just takes that dress

45:52.416 --> 45:55.286

It's so vulnerable.

Jeremy is really excited
to move on.

that he even entertains
dating somebody else. Thanks.

46:17.775 --> 46:19.377
It's really tough
for him, I think,

46:19.377 --> 46:21.345
'cause he felt a lot of guilt
about the whole thing.

46:21.345 --> 46:23.581
I mean, that's all he was racked
with the whole time.

46:23.581 --> 46:26.717
And for him to want to go
on a date with somebody else

46:26.717 --> 46:28.119
just hints at the,

46:28.119 --> 46:29.453
you know, he's ready to move on

46:29.453 --> 46:31.455

in some capacity.

46:33.057 --> 46:34.859
Maybe not completely, but...

46:34.859 --> 46:36.427
but that he's willing to.

46:36.427 --> 46:38.896
So it was a really hopeful,
nice moment.

46:38.896 --> 46:40.398
