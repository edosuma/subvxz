I'd hammer a nail through my skull
if he asked me to.

15:02.556 --> 15:04.547
WILLARD:
The witness is dismissed.

15:08.362 --> 15:09.420
I tried to look mean.

15:09.830 --> 15:11.889
A little more work, you'll have it.

15:13.801 --> 15:17.794
You seem to have some loyal people
working with you, Judge Stone.

15:17.972 --> 15:20.964
I would like to think
that I earned their respect, Your Honor.

15:21.141 --> 15:24.076
Well, it appears that you have,
Judge Stone.

15:24.812 --> 15:27.781
You've done a real
crummy job here, Willard.

15:28.215 --> 15:29.705
Thank you, sir.

15:30.284 --> 15:35.244
In my opinion, Harold T. Stone
is more than qualified to carry on...

15:35.422 --> 15:36.446
WILLARD:
Your Honor.

15:36.624 --> 15:41.084
The prosecution
has one more witness to introduce.

15:41.262 --> 15:45.255
Knowing full well that he would be
appearing before this review board today...

15:45.432 --> 15:49.732
...Harold Stone flagrantly disregarded
his position as a judge...

15:49.904 --> 15:55.365
...when two days ago,
he openly consorted with a prostitute.

15:55.809 --> 15:57.834
Now we're cooking.

15:58.412 --> 16:00.039
Call Carla Bouvier.

16:00.881 --> 16:02.974
Carla. What's going on here?

16:03.150 --> 16:06.142
To put it simply, Saturday night,
you and this woman, a hooker...

16:06.320 --> 16:09.448
...spent the night in your apartment.
Do you deny it?

16:10.057 --> 16:11.354
You must have followed me.

16:11.525 --> 16:13.959
You sat outside my apartment
all night in the rain...

16:14.128 --> 16:16.096
...to dig up a little piece of dirt on me?

16:16.530 --> 16:18.896
I got time and a half.

16:19.600 --> 16:21.500
You don't have to tell them anything.

16:21.669 --> 16:24.137
Oh, yes, you do, Miss Bouvier.
You're under subpoena.

16:24.305 --> 16:26.705
- Miss Bouvier, please take a seat.
- No.

16:26.874 --> 16:28.671
Did he say no?

16:28.842 --> 16:32.073
You have no right
to pry into my personal life or hers.

16:32.246 --> 16:34.771
None of this has to do
with my competency at the bench.

16:34.949 --> 16:37.144
I think we should let a court decide that.

16:37.318 --> 16:40.116
Uh, you are the court, sir.

16:40.521 --> 16:43.012
Say, that's convenient, isn't it?

16:43.490 --> 16:46.391
If this is gonna have bearing
on the outcome of this hearing...

16:46.560 --> 16:48.790
...l'll save you all the trouble.

16:49.563 --> 16:51.360
I quit.

Yeah?

17:15.489 --> 17:17.616
- Your Honor.
- Hey, Mac.

17:18.659 --> 17:20.354
I, uh...

17:20.694 --> 17:22.888
I found your dribble glass.

17:24.198 --> 17:27.098
It was in the, uh, guards' lounge.

17:30.004 --> 17:31.801
You keep it.

17:34.341 --> 17:35.968
Well, thanks, Your Honor.

17:36.143 --> 17:39.112
Every time Bull drools, I'll think of you.

17:39.713 --> 17:42.614
You know, you can cut the "Your Honor,"
I'm just Harry now.

17:43.717 --> 17:46.811
Well, I prefer "Your Honor."

- Listen, I'd rather be alone now, huh?
- No problem.

17:57.297 --> 17:59.561
I'm afraid the judge
can't take visitors now, sir.

17:59.733 --> 18:01.325
Let me be the judge of that.

You a Shriner, Stone?

18:14.448 --> 18:16.973
No, I picked that up at the
Goodwill in the Village.

18:17.151 --> 18:20.279
That's where I got
my Captain Video helmet.

18:20.721 --> 18:24.122
- You've got a Captain Video helmet?
- You didn't invent whimsy, you know.

18:24.291 --> 18:27.488
I'm not senile, Stone.
I've been like this for 50 years.

18:27.661 --> 18:31.427
So even if I do become senile,
people will never know.

18:32.366 --> 18:35.267
Come to think of it,
I won't know either, will I?

18:36.770 --> 18:38.032
- Listen, judge...
- Shut up.

18:38.205 --> 18:40.867
I'm old. I can talk as long as I want.

18:41.809 --> 18:43.333
Stone...

18:43.510 --> 18:47.776
...when I saw you,
I saw me 30 years ago.

18:48.282 --> 18:50.375
You were a breath of fresh air...

18:50.551 --> 18:52.314
...but you disappointed me.

18:52.486 --> 18:55.114
You had potential, but you screwed up.

18:55.722 --> 18:56.746
I quit.

18:57.491 --> 19:01.393
That, in my book, is screwing up.

19:01.795 --> 19:03.592
What are you, nuts?

19:03.764 --> 19:05.925
Are you seeing anybody else, sir?

19:06.100 --> 19:09.160
- You can't quit your job.
- I just told him.

19:09.336 --> 19:11.327
This is my fault.
I wanna straighten it out.

19:11.505 --> 19:13.666
I already told you,
that is out of the question.

19:13.841 --> 19:17.140
You can't tell me what to do anymore.
You're not a judge, remember?

19:17.311 --> 19:20.542
She's got you
by the statutes there, Stone.

19:21.048 --> 19:24.677
Uh, young lady, mmm,
why don't you tell me the story?

19:24.852 --> 19:26.683
Well, perhaps I'd better be going.

19:27.054 --> 19:29.682
Harry Stone is the sexiest man I know.

19:29.857 --> 19:31.916
The truth is
I would love to sleep with him.

19:32.092 --> 19:34.287
I guess I have a minute.

19:36.196 --> 19:38.721
The point is I didn't, and I won't.

19:38.899 --> 19:41.663
I don't wanna lose what we have.

19:44.571 --> 19:47.768
See, sometimes
I work this corner uptown.

19:47.941 --> 19:50.307
It's not the greatest neighborhood,
but it's okay.

19:50.477 --> 19:54.914
- Carla, you really don't have to.
- Ignore him. Continue.

19:55.449 --> 19:59.442
Anyway, a couple of nights ago,
these cops picked me up...

19:59.620 --> 20:04.353
...and I figured, well, I'm on the way back
to see Judge Stone again...

20:04.525 --> 20:06.823
...but they said
they weren't there to bust me.

20:06.994 --> 20:09.963
They needed me to identify a body...

20:10.130 --> 20:13.293
...so they drove me to the morgue.

20:13.600 --> 20:15.033
Someone you knew?

20:15.769 --> 20:17.498
Marie.

20:18.272 --> 20:19.796
Uh...

20:19.973 --> 20:22.669
We worked the same corner sometimes.

20:24.678 --> 20:29.775
All those times I'd seen her around,
I never knew her last name.

20:30.117 --> 20:33.553
But when I looked down at the body...

20:34.555 --> 20:36.386
...all I could see was myself.

20:38.358 --> 20:41.623
I'd never felt so alone
or so scared in my life.

20:44.164 --> 20:45.791
So you went to see Judge Stone.

20:47.067 --> 20:48.898
He's a friend.

20:49.069 --> 20:52.402
He didn't preach.
He didn't talk down to me.

20:52.573 --> 20:54.370
He just listened.

20:54.541 --> 20:56.600
And then he held me...

20:57.010 --> 20:59.274
...and he just let me cry all night.

21:01.481 --> 21:04.143
He's the only person I know...

21:04.551 --> 21:07.850
...who ever made me feel like
I was worth anything.

21:10.958 --> 21:14.291
See? It was easy.

21:15.862 --> 21:17.853
Of course it was.

21:22.736 --> 21:26.797
I don't think it's fair that I didn't get to
present these facts at the hearing.

21:26.974 --> 21:29.670
I have done research
and found precedent after precedent...

21:29.843 --> 21:31.538
...in support of Judge Stone's case.

21:31.712 --> 21:34.340
These accusations of impropriety
are totally unfounded...

21:34.514 --> 21:37.483
...and I demand that
the charges be dropped immediately.

21:38.385 --> 21:40.182
Agreed.

21:42.556 --> 21:44.148
Well, good.

or the way I presented it?
