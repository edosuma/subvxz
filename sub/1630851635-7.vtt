[tense music]

00:21.896 --> 00:28.862
* *

00:28.903 --> 00:30.196
[knocking]

00:30.238 --> 00:33.366
- I have good news.
Principal Gupta called.

00:33.408 --> 00:35.618
The disciplinary committee
finished their investigation

00:35.660 --> 00:37.203
into the cheating
accusations,

00:37.245 --> 00:38.788
and they didn't find
any wrongdoing.

00:38.830 --> 00:41.332
Finally, we can put all
of this behind us

00:41.374 --> 00:43.710
and focus on your future.

00:45.420 --> 00:49.382
So how's the Yale essay?
Did you want me to read it?

00:49.424 --> 00:51.051
- It's not really ready yet.

00:51.092 --> 00:54.554
- Bronwyn, the early action
deadline is this Saturday.

00:54.596 --> 00:57.307
Sweetheart, I understand
that you are upset about Nate.

00:57.349 --> 00:58.975
And I am truly sorry
he didn't end up being

00:59.017 --> 01:00.310
who you wanted him to be.

01:00.352 --> 01:03.063
- Mom, he didn't do it!
I mean, an anonymous tip?

01:03.104 --> 01:04.689
And why would he keep
the EpiPens?

01:04.731 --> 01:06.107
- Because EpiPens
are expensive.

01:06.149 --> 01:07.442
Maybe he needed the money.

01:07.484 --> 01:10.779
And he was fleeing to Mexico.
Who does that?

01:12.197 --> 01:14.491
Sweetheart, there isn't
anything you can do about it.

01:14.532 --> 01:16.409
It's time to move forward.

01:16.451 --> 01:18.953
Everything you have
worked so hard for

01:18.995 --> 01:20.413
is still within your reach

01:20.455 --> 01:23.792
if you focus on
getting back on track.

01:23.833 --> 01:26.586
Hey.

01:26.628 --> 01:29.422
That could start
with your personal statement.

01:31.424 --> 01:33.718
- No, you're right.

01:33.760 --> 01:36.262
- Sweetheart.

01:36.304 --> 01:40.892
* *

01:40.934 --> 01:44.938
I love you,
and I am really proud of you.

01:44.979 --> 01:51.903
* *

02:08.211 --> 02:10.630
- Fuck this.

02:10.672 --> 02:17.595
* *

02:28.231 --> 02:30.984
* When I ain't with you *

02:31.026 --> 02:32.193
* I wonder what you do *

02:32.235 --> 02:33.611
[phone buzzes]

02:33.653 --> 02:35.530
* When I ain't home *

02:35.572 --> 02:38.366
* I don't know what to do *

02:38.408 --> 02:40.702
* When I ain't with you *

02:40.744 --> 02:41.995
[knocking]

02:42.037 --> 02:43.329
- Tagged all of Rob Calhoun's
articles, okay?

02:43.371 --> 02:44.706
I want you to read them,

02:44.748 --> 02:46.499
see what kind of questions
he asks

02:46.541 --> 02:48.043
so that you're prepared
for your interview.

02:48.084 --> 02:49.878
- Dad, don't you think
maybe we should postpone?

02:49.919 --> 02:51.212
Just saying,
with Nate and everything,

02:51.254 --> 02:52.714
is this really--

02:52.756 --> 02:54.507
- Oh, hell no, man.
This guy is a kingmaker.

02:54.549 --> 02:56.217
All right, he knows you're
only going to be there

02:56.259 --> 02:58.011
to talk about baseball.

02:58.053 --> 02:59.721
All right?
- Mm-hmm.

02:59.763 --> 03:01.723
- If he asks you about Simon,
just, you let him know

03:01.765 --> 03:04.059
that the police have
their man now, okay?

03:04.100 --> 03:05.393
And that you're innocent.

03:05.435 --> 03:07.562
Also, if he brings up the photo

03:07.604 --> 03:09.606
of the four
of you guys together,

03:09.647 --> 03:11.316
tell him that Nate
just tried to drag you guys

03:11.358 --> 03:13.943
down with him,
but you didn't let him.

03:18.281 --> 03:21.242
Hey, listen.

03:21.284 --> 03:22.744
If we have to,

03:22.786 --> 03:26.373
we use this whole shitshow
to our advantage

03:26.414 --> 03:30.210
[tense music]

03:30.251 --> 03:34.130
This is your moment,
Cooperstown.

03:34.172 --> 03:37.175
* *

03:37.217 --> 03:39.636
Yeah?

03:39.678 --> 03:41.971
Read up.

03:42.013 --> 03:48.978
* *

03:59.531 --> 04:01.116
- Sorry I'm late.

04:01.157 --> 04:03.618
I'm not used to this
whole media circus thing.

04:03.660 --> 04:06.121
I barely made it
out of the car.

04:06.162 --> 04:08.748
My boss says this shirt's
no good for camera,

04:08.790 --> 04:10.333
something about the stripes.

04:10.375 --> 04:11.918
- You want to trade outfits?

04:11.960 --> 04:14.462
I wouldn't want
to make you look bad.

04:14.504 --> 04:16.589
- Haven't lost your sense
of humor.

04:16.631 --> 04:21.386
That's good, yeah,
and I have more good news.

04:21.428 --> 04:23.596
They offered you a plea deal.

04:23.638 --> 04:25.015
If you plead guilty
to taking the EpiPens,

04:25.056 --> 04:26.474
they'll reduce

04:26.516 --> 04:28.476
the charges to
involuntary manslaughter.

04:28.518 --> 04:30.020
- What's the sentence
for that?

04:30.061 --> 04:31.646
- Six years.

04:31.688 --> 04:33.648
But with good behavior,
he could be out in four.

04:33.690 --> 04:36.026
- Nate, that's
just like college.

04:36.067 --> 04:37.694
- It's a good deal.

04:37.736 --> 04:40.155
If we go to trial,
you could get life.

04:40.196 --> 04:42.365
* *

04:42.407 --> 04:43.867
- What about the others?

04:43.908 --> 04:46.036
- You sign this,
the case is closed.

04:46.077 --> 04:48.079
If we go to trial,
go through discovery,

04:48.121 --> 04:49.497
who knows what else

04:49.539 --> 04:50.999
the police could
drag up about them?

04:51.041 --> 04:54.210
* *

04:54.252 --> 04:56.546
- I'll think about it.

04:56.588 --> 04:58.548
- What's there
to think about?

04:58.590 --> 05:01.134
Look, we have 72 hours
to respond,

05:01.176 --> 05:03.887
and then
the deal goes away.

05:03.928 --> 05:08.516
* *

05:08.558 --> 05:10.018
- What I don't get is why
someone put one pen

05:10.060 --> 05:11.311
in my locker

05:11.353 --> 05:12.604
and all the rest
on Nate's bike.

05:12.645 --> 05:14.522
- Maybe it was a distraction.

05:14.564 --> 05:16.232
Or they were trying
to frame you, too.

05:16.274 --> 05:17.567
- So are you one of us now?

05:17.609 --> 05:21.112
- Okay, it was my best friend
who was murdered.

05:21.154 --> 05:23.281
Also, Bronwyn invited me.

05:23.323 --> 05:25.700
- Okay, Nate's in jail.
We have to get him out.

05:25.742 --> 05:27.369
So we need
all the help we can get.

05:27.410 --> 05:30.288
- Absolutely.
So what's the plan?

05:30.330 --> 05:31.498
- Ms. Avery.

05:31.539 --> 05:33.458
We know the cops
weren't looking at her

05:33.500 --> 05:34.793
because they thought
she had no motive,

05:34.834 --> 05:36.378
but now we know
that she did

05:36.419 --> 05:38.463
'cause Simon had something
on her.

05:38.505 --> 05:40.048
- Do you think she was
sleeping with a student?

05:40.090 --> 05:42.258
- Wait, who would she
possibly be sleeping with?

05:42.300 --> 05:44.135
- Just saying, that is
always the teacher's secret.

05:44.177 --> 05:45.845
- Whatever it is, we just
need to get her talking.

05:45.887 --> 05:47.389
We bluff.

05:47.430 --> 05:48.556
We tell her we know
what she did.

05:48.598 --> 05:50.850
and then we record a response.

05:50.892 --> 05:52.185
- Yeah, who's gonna do that?

05:52.227 --> 05:54.229
- Someone who could
have believably heard it

05:54.270 --> 05:55.522
from Simon.

05:55.563 --> 05:59.651
* *

05:59.693 --> 06:01.528
- So that's why she's here.

06:01.569 --> 06:03.071
- Sorry, what?

06:03.113 --> 06:06.116
- Do you want to know what
really happened to Simon?

06:06.157 --> 06:10.245
[bell rings]

06:10.286 --> 06:17.210
* *

06:25.010 --> 06:27.846
- Ms. Avery?

06:27.887 --> 06:30.098
Was wondering
if you had a minute to talk.

06:30.140 --> 06:32.517
- Regarding?

06:32.559 --> 06:34.978
- Simon.

06:47.490 --> 06:50.994
So they arrested Nate,
but I--

06:51.036 --> 06:53.621
- But you don't think
he did it.

06:53.663 --> 06:56.458
You made that pretty clear
at the homecoming dance.

06:56.499 --> 06:59.169
- Yeah, right.

07:00.712 --> 07:04.758
I have some information
that could help Nate,

07:04.799 --> 07:06.468
but if I go to the police
with it,

07:06.509 --> 07:08.136
it could be hurting
someone else

07:08.178 --> 07:11.014
- Who?

07:11.056 --> 07:13.224
- You.

07:13.266 --> 07:14.976
* *

07:15.018 --> 07:17.604
I know Simon was going
to write about you,

07:17.645 --> 07:20.648
which gives you as much motive
as anyone else in that room.

07:20.690 --> 07:23.151
- I don't know
what you're talking about.

07:23.193 --> 07:24.861
- I could go to the cops,

07:24.903 --> 07:27.781
but I wanted to give you
a chance to explain

07:27.822 --> 07:31.159
because you've always been one
of my favorite teachers.

07:31.201 --> 07:33.078
- Are you giving me
a chance to explain,

07:33.119 --> 07:34.996
or are you fishing
for me to say something

07:35.038 --> 07:36.831
because you have
an outlandish theory

07:36.873 --> 07:38.083
but nothing to back it up?

07:38.124 --> 07:42.337
- I can back it up.
Simon texted me about it.

07:42.379 --> 07:43.713
- Can you show me?

07:43.755 --> 07:50.887
* *

07:59.729 --> 08:01.189
May I take a closer look?

08:01.231 --> 08:04.275
- I might not get straight A's,
but I'm not stupid.

08:04.317 --> 08:06.027
- But you think I am.

08:06.069 --> 08:08.571
Why should I believe that
that was really from Simon?

08:08.613 --> 08:10.740
- Because it is.

08:10.782 --> 08:16.538
* *

08:16.579 --> 08:17.872
- Nice try, Janae.

08:17.914 --> 08:19.749
But I think
we're done here

08:19.791 --> 08:25.463
* *

08:25.505 --> 08:28.550
Close the door
on your way out.

08:28.591 --> 08:32.262
* *

08:32.303 --> 08:33.805
I could lose my job,

08:33.847 --> 08:35.557
my teaching license,
my whole life!

08:35.598 --> 08:37.892
- I know.
- And you don't care.

08:37.934 --> 08:39.269
- If I didn't care,

08:39.310 --> 08:40.895
I would've posted it
by now, but--

08:40.937 --> 08:41.813
- I have a confession,
Mr. Kelleher.

08:41.855 --> 08:43.565
I understand why you want

08:43.606 --> 08:45.442
to expose the hypocrisy
around us.

08:45.483 --> 08:47.694
In my mind, I've justified
that you took a hammer

08:47.736 --> 08:49.070
to your fellow students' lives

08:49.112 --> 08:50.655
because some
of them deserved it,

08:50.697 --> 08:52.198
and all of them
have so much time ahead

08:52.240 --> 08:54.075
of them to glue
the pieces back together.

08:54.117 --> 08:55.368
But I don't.

08:55.410 --> 08:56.911
What I did doesn't
make me a hypocrite.

08:56.953 --> 08:58.121
I don't deserve this.

08:58.163 --> 08:59.914
So why are you
doing this to me?

08:59.956 --> 09:02.709
- Just do something for me
in exchange,

09:02.751 --> 09:04.919
and nobody has to know.

09:04.961 --> 09:06.421
- So you're
blackmailing me?

09:06.463 --> 09:09.341
- I'm giving you a choice.

09:09.382 --> 09:12.385
I thought you of all people
would appreciate that.

09:12.427 --> 09:14.179
Choice.

09:14.220 --> 09:21.144
* *

09:25.440 --> 09:26.941
- You okay?

09:26.983 --> 09:28.693
- She knew the text was fake,

09:28.735 --> 09:30.779
and I think she guessed
I was recording.

09:30.820 --> 09:33.656
- Great, she's smart,
smart enough

09:33.698 --> 09:35.367
that the could've
planned the whole thing.

09:35.408 --> 09:37.577
- We still don't have proof.

09:37.619 --> 09:40.747
- I don't know
if she was bluffing.

09:40.789 --> 09:42.332
Okay, I'll meet you there.

09:42.374 --> 09:44.084
- Did you hear that?
- We have to follow her.

09:44.125 --> 09:45.418
- What?
- Where's your car?

09:45.460 --> 09:47.087
- No, no!

09:47.128 --> 09:48.505
- Yeah.

09:48.546 --> 09:52.801
* *

09:52.842 --> 09:54.135
- Now what?

09:54.177 --> 09:55.553
- We need to see
who she's meeting.

09:55.595 --> 09:56.721
- It's probably
her accomplice.

09:56.763 --> 09:58.223
- Great, so now
we're not just spying

09:58.264 --> 09:59.307
on one murderer but two?

09:59.349 --> 10:00.850
- Cool.
You have a better plan?

10:00.892 --> 10:02.477
- Well, maybe the person
she's meeting's coming here.

10:02.519 --> 10:04.813
- So we wait.

10:04.854 --> 10:06.815
- Sure, a car double parked

10:06.856 --> 10:08.316
with the five of us is
not suspicious at all.

10:08.358 --> 10:10.443
- Is this a stakeout?
Can we put the top up?

10:10.485 --> 10:12.445
- Yeah, can we park somewhere?
- There's nowhere.

10:12.487 --> 10:14.781
- Never happened
to Ryan Gosling in "Drive."

10:14.823 --> 10:16.825
* *

10:16.866 --> 10:19.327
None of you
have seen "Drive?"

10:19.369 --> 10:20.912
- Look.

10:20.954 --> 10:24.833
* *

10:24.874 --> 10:27.210
- Wait, is that...

10:27.252 --> 10:33.174
* *

10:38.680 --> 10:39.764
- I knew Vanessa was a bitch.

10:39.806 --> 10:41.057
I didn't know
she was actually evil.

10:41.099 --> 10:42.517
- Look, we don't know
how involved she was.

10:42.559 --> 10:43.601
- She took that picture of us

10:43.643 --> 10:45.103
at homecoming,
and she's been, like,

10:45.145 --> 10:48.064
gleefully posting about us
being murder suspects,

10:48.106 --> 10:50.608
maybe to cover her own ass.

10:50.650 --> 10:54.362
* *

10:54.404 --> 10:56.656
Do you think
they were having an affair?

10:56.698 --> 10:58.450
- Addy, not everyone's gay.

10:58.491 --> 11:00.201
- It's always
the teacher's secret.

11:00.243 --> 11:01.870
- Okay, but do you
really think that Vanessa

11:01.911 --> 11:03.705
would go for Ms. Avery?

11:03.747 --> 11:06.374
- I mean, no, no, not really.

11:06.416 --> 11:09.586
But I feel like I
don't know anyone anymore.

11:09.627 --> 11:11.421
Turns out everyone's been
hiding all these different

11:11.463 --> 11:15.175
sides of themselves
this whole time.

11:15.216 --> 11:17.093
- You don't do that?

11:17.135 --> 11:18.553
- There's different sides
to me,

11:18.595 --> 11:20.972
but I wasn't hiding them.

11:21.014 --> 11:23.933
I didn't even know
they were there.

11:23.975 --> 11:28.146
I guess that's the upside
to all of this.

11:28.188 --> 11:29.981
- I like these new
sides of you.

11:33.234 --> 11:35.695
- I'll try talking to Vanessa.

11:35.737 --> 11:36.946
Maybe there's a side of me

11:36.988 --> 11:40.742
that knows how
to get her to spill.

11:40.784 --> 11:45.789
And I like
the new Cooper, too.

11:45.830 --> 11:48.249
He seems happier.

11:57.175 --> 11:59.803
What are you doing here?

11:59.844 --> 12:01.513
- Your mom let me in.

12:01.554 --> 12:04.683
I didn't...

12:04.724 --> 12:06.768
Look, I just wanted
to continue the conversation

12:06.810 --> 12:10.355
that we started at homecoming.

12:10.397 --> 12:11.648
Listen, Addy,

12:11.690 --> 12:13.149
I know that you've been
through a lot lately,

12:13.191 --> 12:15.985
and I haven't been there
for you, and...

12:16.027 --> 12:17.654
- You asked me if I did it.

12:17.696 --> 12:20.156
- And that was awful of me.

12:20.198 --> 12:25.286
But it's just--you were
my whole world, Ads,

12:25.328 --> 12:29.749
And he love of my life,
so to find out that you've...

12:29.791 --> 12:31.626
with one of my best friends,

12:31.668 --> 12:36.047
I just--I was so hurt

12:38.425 --> 12:41.845
- Jake, I never meant
to hurt you.

12:41.886 --> 12:46.516
- I just I want my Ads back.

12:46.558 --> 12:51.062
- I miss you, too,
but I don't miss her.

12:52.355 --> 12:54.649
I was always so,
so scared of losing you

12:54.691 --> 12:56.735
that I felt like
I was walking on eggshells,

12:56.776 --> 12:58.862
and if I did anything
that you didn't like,

12:58.903 --> 13:00.030
you'd break up with me.

13:00.071 --> 13:00.989
- That is not how I wanted
you to feel.

13:01.031 --> 13:02.949
- Hey, let me finish.

13:02.991 --> 13:07.495
* *

13:07.537 --> 13:11.207
- Jake, my whole world
ended when we broke up.

13:11.249 --> 13:12.834
I was so scared
of losing you,

13:12.876 --> 13:14.586
and then
I didn't just lose you.

13:14.627 --> 13:15.879
I lost my best friends.

13:15.920 --> 13:17.297
And I became
a murder suspect.

13:17.339 --> 13:19.382
And you know
what I realized?

13:19.424 --> 13:21.551
Jake, I realized
I can handle it.

13:21.593 --> 13:23.345
I may not have a choice,

13:23.386 --> 13:25.972
but you know how good it feels

13:26.014 --> 13:28.141
to not be
so careful all the time?

13:28.183 --> 13:30.018
* *

13:30.060 --> 13:31.519
You know?

13:31.561 --> 13:34.856
I haven't had to take Xanax
in I don't know how long.

13:34.898 --> 13:36.399
That's good, isn't it?

13:36.441 --> 13:38.401
- Are you kidding me?
That's great, that's great.

13:38.443 --> 13:41.529
That's so good.
I'm so proud of you, Addy.

13:41.571 --> 13:43.239
* *

13:43.281 --> 13:46.743
And look,
believe it or not, I do.

13:46.785 --> 13:48.912
I like this new you.

13:48.953 --> 13:52.874
You know, she's hot.

13:52.916 --> 13:54.417
I mean, a little intimidating,

13:54.459 --> 13:57.712
but, I mean,
I could get into it.

13:57.754 --> 14:00.548
- Yeah.
- I'm malleable.

14:00.590 --> 14:02.967
Yeah, I mean,
I'm not the same guy

14:03.009 --> 14:04.803
that I was
two months ago either.

14:04.844 --> 14:08.139
I don't think he would've
gotten us tickets for--

14:08.181 --> 14:10.600
- The ice cream pop-up.
How did you--

14:10.642 --> 14:14.104
- Well, you know,
tomorrow's our anniversary?

14:14.145 --> 14:16.815
Four years.

14:16.856 --> 14:18.400
- You didn't want to go.

14:18.441 --> 14:21.027
- No, but you did,
and it sounds fun.

14:21.069 --> 14:23.905
What do you say?
You got plans?

14:23.947 --> 14:27.742
* *

14:27.784 --> 14:31.162
I know you're still hanging
out with Bronwyn and Janae.

14:31.204 --> 14:33.164
Your mom told me.

14:33.206 --> 14:35.792
* *

14:35.834 --> 14:40.171
Why can't we just wake up
from this nightmare

14:40.213 --> 14:44.300
and just go back to normal,
please?

14:44.342 --> 14:46.344
You know, there's some people
that still think that you

14:46.386 --> 14:48.555
and your murder club
did it together.

14:48.596 --> 14:50.765
* *

14:50.807 --> 14:52.392
- But we didn't.

14:52.434 --> 14:55.061
- No, of course,
I know that, Addy.

14:55.103 --> 14:56.146
I know that
it was just Nate.

14:56.187 --> 14:57.522
But I'm just saying.

14:57.564 --> 14:59.315
- What?

14:59.357 --> 15:03.028
- Jake, Nate didn't
do it either.

15:03.069 --> 15:04.738
Fuck.

15:04.779 --> 15:08.783
- I don't understand.
You said so yourself.

15:08.825 --> 15:12.162
- That was before I knew him.

15:12.203 --> 15:14.122
Jake, we can't just pretend

15:14.164 --> 15:17.000
that these past
two months didn't happen

15:17.042 --> 15:19.085
- Would that be so wrong?

15:19.127 --> 15:22.005
To just go
on a date tomorrow?

15:22.047 --> 15:24.674
- I'll think about it.

15:24.716 --> 15:30.055
* *

15:30.096 --> 15:32.223
- Okay.

15:32.265 --> 15:39.272
* *

15:39.314 --> 15:42.192
I really hope you say yes.

15:42.233 --> 15:49.449
* *

15:49.908 --> 15:53.411
- Look, Nate's not perfect.
He has a lot of problems.

15:53.453 --> 15:55.955
Personally, I suffer
from bipolar disorder,

15:55.997 --> 15:59.125
and I haven't always
had it under control.

15:59.167 --> 16:00.794
And that wasn't easy
for Nathaniel.

16:00.835 --> 16:02.712
I mean, no wonder
he started dealing drugs

16:02.754 --> 16:04.214
because he had
to support himself

16:04.255 --> 16:08.843
I mean,
his dad--can we go back?

16:08.885 --> 16:11.554
What I mean is--what
I meant to say was--

16:11.596 --> 16:14.099
- I'm sorry, kid.
You were screwed yesterday.

16:14.140 --> 16:16.142
But today you're fucked.

16:16.184 --> 16:18.228
From a legal perspective,

16:18.269 --> 16:21.314
I think you should
take the plea.

16:21.356 --> 16:22.649
- We've been offered
a plea deal,

16:22.691 --> 16:25.276
and we're considering
taking it, yeah.

16:25.318 --> 16:26.820
- I need to talk to him.

16:26.861 --> 16:28.321
He needs to know
we're close with Ms. Avery.

16:28.363 --> 16:30.073
- Well did you know
that Avery's not here today?

16:30.115 --> 16:31.574
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

16:31.616 --> 16:34.452
- She's literally never had
a sub before.

16:34.494 --> 16:37.288
She knows we're onto her.
We have to find her.

16:37.330 --> 16:39.332
- What, and just, like,
show up at her house?

16:39.374 --> 16:40.750
You're gonna cut class?

16:40.792 --> 16:42.544
- Yes, I am.

16:42.585 --> 16:43.628
- Cool.

16:43.670 --> 16:50.593
* *

16:52.262 --> 16:53.680
- Hey!

16:53.722 --> 16:55.223
- Oh, my God.

16:55.265 --> 16:58.018
- We need to talk.

16:58.059 --> 16:59.519
- What about it?

16:59.561 --> 17:01.354
- I wanted to give you
a chance to explain

17:01.396 --> 17:02.939
before I show this
to the police.

17:02.981 --> 17:04.566
- I needed help with physics.

17:04.607 --> 17:06.234
- You don't care
about your grades.

17:06.276 --> 17:07.694
And if you did,
your parents would hire you

17:07.736 --> 17:09.154
a private tutor from NASA
or something.

17:09.195 --> 17:10.822
- Okay, you don't know me
nearly as well

17:10.864 --> 17:12.449
as you think you do, Addy.

17:12.490 --> 17:13.783
So why don't you and your
little Nancy Drew friends

17:13.825 --> 17:15.243
stay the fuck
out of my business.

17:15.285 --> 17:16.661
- Vanessa!

17:16.703 --> 17:21.666
* *

17:21.708 --> 17:24.669
- Hey!
We had a deal, asshole.

17:24.711 --> 17:26.129
- Why past tense?

17:26.171 --> 17:28.214
- You weren't supposed to come
after me or my friends.

17:28.256 --> 17:29.424
Good luck trying
to find someone else

17:29.466 --> 17:30.800
to bring you dirt.

17:30.842 --> 17:32.427
Hope you enjoy trying
to hack into their DMs.

17:32.469 --> 17:34.095
- I won't use your name.

17:34.137 --> 17:37.557
- Okay, but you'll...

17:37.599 --> 17:40.477
you'll use Ms. Avery's?

17:40.518 --> 17:44.147
Okay, go ahead, Simon.
Post about me.

17:44.189 --> 17:46.316
Just don't take
her down with me.

17:46.358 --> 17:48.318
- I won't.

17:48.360 --> 17:49.611
I just need her

17:49.652 --> 17:51.279
to do something
for me in exchange

17:51.321 --> 17:53.365
- [scoffs]

17:53.406 --> 17:56.368
Wow, look at you.

17:56.409 --> 17:58.370
You started
so holier-than-thou,

17:58.411 --> 18:00.163
and now you're basically
the bastard child

18:00.205 --> 18:04.209
of a TMZ hack
and a mob intern.

18:04.250 --> 18:05.794
I can't wait for one
of your victims

18:05.835 --> 18:09.297
to wipe the fucking smirk
off your face forever.

18:09.339 --> 18:14.886
* *

18:14.928 --> 18:17.347
- Vanessa!

18:17.389 --> 18:19.683
- Ugh, get off my back!

18:19.724 --> 18:21.643
Ah!

18:21.685 --> 18:22.852
[groans]

18:22.894 --> 18:24.729
Ow, Addy, what the fuck?

18:24.771 --> 18:27.065
- Oh, fuck.
Ow, that hurts.

18:27.107 --> 18:29.192
- Oh, shit.
Ads, You gotta go to the nurse.

18:29.234 --> 18:32.487
- No, I'm fine.

18:32.529 --> 18:35.073
Oh, fuck, Vanessa.

18:35.115 --> 18:37.867
I know you didn't
kill Simon.

18:37.909 --> 18:39.786
But I know that he had
something on Ms. Avery.

18:39.828 --> 18:42.539
And I know that it had
something to do with you.

18:42.580 --> 18:46.042
I'm literally
on my bloody knees begging you.

18:46.084 --> 18:48.503
I know we're not
friends anymore,

18:48.545 --> 18:50.505
but Nate is my friend now,
and I don't want him

18:50.547 --> 18:52.716
to go to jail
for something he didn't do.

18:55.593 --> 18:56.970
- Ads, get off your knees.

18:57.012 --> 18:59.723
Everyone already thinks
you're a slut.

18:59.764 --> 19:02.642
- Fuck.

19:06.604 --> 19:08.982
- Well, at least she's not
already in Tijuana.

19:09.024 --> 19:11.026
- No, not yet.

19:15.363 --> 19:17.240
- Is she--

19:17.282 --> 19:24.414
* *

19:26.041 --> 19:28.251
- Can I offer you some tea?

19:28.293 --> 19:31.504
* *

19:31.546 --> 19:33.548
- Give us one good reason

19:33.590 --> 19:35.175
why we shouldn't show
this picture to the police.

19:35.216 --> 19:37.927
- You really have no idea
what you're doing, do you?

19:37.969 --> 19:40.180
- We know exactly what
we're doing

19:40.221 --> 19:41.848
because we know
you killed Simon

19:41.890 --> 19:43.516
so that he wouldn't tell
on you and Vanessa,

19:43.558 --> 19:45.268
and now you're running away
because we're onto you.

19:45.310 --> 19:46.936
- That's quite
an elaborate hypothesis,

19:46.978 --> 19:49.230
but I fear you haven't
properly tested it.

19:49.272 --> 19:51.941
It's not very scientific
of you.

19:51.983 --> 19:55.612
Now I see why you found
chemistry so difficult.

19:55.653 --> 19:57.781
- Okay then,
what's with the suitcase?

19:57.822 --> 19:59.616
And why was Vanessa here
in the first place?

19:59.657 --> 20:03.036
- So you admit you don't know.

20:03.078 --> 20:05.372
- She was just helping me.

20:05.413 --> 20:09.376
- Right, with physics.

20:09.417 --> 20:16.508
* *

20:20.679 --> 20:23.973
- I had an abortion, Addy.

20:24.015 --> 20:26.101
- What?
- Mm-hmm

20:26.142 --> 20:29.646
And Ms. Avery was there for me
because she's a good person.

20:29.688 --> 20:32.649
She's like the opposite
of a killer.

20:32.691 --> 20:35.026
I mean,
unless you're my parents.

20:35.068 --> 20:36.444
If they found out,

20:36.486 --> 20:38.947
they would say
we're both baby killers

20:38.988 --> 20:40.949
- I know what you
all think of me,

20:40.990 --> 20:43.326
but I'm not a monster.

20:43.368 --> 20:46.329
I do actually care
about my students.

20:46.371 --> 20:50.583
- Vanessa, I'm so sorry.

20:50.625 --> 20:52.085
- She caught me trying to skip,

20:52.127 --> 20:54.504
and I told her
I had a doctor's appointment,

20:54.546 --> 20:57.382
so she thought I was lying

20:57.424 --> 21:00.552
because, you know,
I usually am.

21:00.593 --> 21:03.013
And she said she had
to call my parents

21:03.054 --> 21:06.558
to check my story,
so I panicked.

21:06.599 --> 21:10.895
I completely broke down,
and I told her everything.

21:10.937 --> 21:13.023
- I helped Vanessa
when she needed it,

21:13.064 --> 21:16.026
and in doing so,
I violated school rules.

21:16.067 --> 21:17.777
- What school rules?

21:17.819 --> 21:19.571
- She helped me make
an appointment

21:19.612 --> 21:21.948
with a good doctor.

21:21.990 --> 21:24.409
And then she
drove me there.

21:24.451 --> 21:28.079
And she held my hand
while I waited.

21:28.121 --> 21:29.539
She even paid for it,

21:29.581 --> 21:32.042
so my parents
would never find out.

21:32.083 --> 21:34.210
- We're talking
about the same Ms. Avery?

21:34.252 --> 21:35.628
- Mm-hmm.

21:35.670 --> 21:38.298
Even total bitches
have feelings, Addy.

21:38.340 --> 21:39.716
You should know.

21:39.758 --> 21:42.594
Look, I'm not ashamed
about what I did.

21:42.635 --> 21:45.055
I just really don't want
Ms. Avery

21:45.096 --> 21:47.724
to get punished
for being nice to me.

21:47.766 --> 21:49.684
- Simon said he wouldn't
post about it

21:49.726 --> 21:52.020
if I did something for him.

21:52.062 --> 21:54.189
* *

21:54.230 --> 21:56.733
He had me give you
all detention that day

21:56.775 --> 21:58.902
because he wanted
to be alone with you.

21:58.943 --> 22:00.487
- How do we know that
you didn't take

22:00.528 --> 22:02.197
that opportunity
to kill him yourself?

22:02.238 --> 22:04.908
Make sure that your job
and your secret stayed safe?

22:04.949 --> 22:07.744
- How could I?
I wasn't even in the room.

22:07.786 --> 22:09.412
I was dealing
with the streakers.

22:09.454 --> 22:14.292
* *

22:14.334 --> 22:16.336
- I won't ask about the dad.

22:16.378 --> 22:19.756
- Bitch, you just did.
No!

22:19.798 --> 22:21.591
Are you kidding?
Why would I tell you?

22:21.633 --> 22:24.094
You've been, like,
the worst best friend ever.

22:24.135 --> 22:25.428
- What about you?

22:25.470 --> 22:26.888
You treated me like shit,

22:26.930 --> 22:28.765
humiliated me
in front of everyone,

22:28.807 --> 22:30.141
called me a murderer.

22:30.183 --> 22:31.935
- Maybe I didn't mind
the spotlight

22:31.976 --> 22:34.604
being on someone else for once

22:34.646 --> 22:36.648
and as far away
from Ms. Avery as possible.

22:40.026 --> 22:46.574
Ads, you cannot tell
anyone about her.

22:46.616 --> 22:48.201
- I don't think
she did it, guys.

22:48.243 --> 22:50.954
- Okay, even if Vanessa's
telling the truth,

22:50.995 --> 22:52.580
it doesn't mean that Avery is.

22:52.622 --> 22:53.957
She could've totally
put the peanut oil

22:53.998 --> 22:55.291
in his cup and then left, easy.

22:55.333 --> 22:56.793
- How could she have known
that the streakers

22:56.835 --> 22:59.170
would be there
at that exact moment?

22:59.212 --> 23:01.798
- Is it possible that they
were supposed to be there?

23:01.840 --> 23:03.258
Like it was part
of the plan?

23:03.299 --> 23:05.301
I mean, if she got us
all into detention

23:05.343 --> 23:07.637
so she could kill Simon
and blame it on us,

23:07.679 --> 23:09.055
then maybe she orchestrated
for the streakers

23:09.097 --> 23:11.891
to be there, too,
so she'd have an alibi?

23:11.933 --> 23:13.018
We need to go to the police.

23:13.059 --> 23:14.811
Maybe they can
find the streakers.

23:14.853 --> 23:16.896
- But what if Vanessa's right?

23:16.938 --> 23:18.523
What is Ms. Avery is innocent?

23:18.565 --> 23:19.983
If we go to the police,

23:20.025 --> 23:22.277
we would be destroying both
their lives for nothing.

23:22.318 --> 23:23.778
- They were from Laguna, right?

23:23.820 --> 23:25.113
You guys know anyone there

23:25.155 --> 23:27.782
that could help us
track them down?

23:27.824 --> 23:29.993
- I have a friend
who went there.

23:30.035 --> 23:33.079
He graduated last year,
but he might be able to help.

23:33.121 --> 23:34.497
- That's great.

23:34.539 --> 23:36.166
[phone buzzes]

23:36.207 --> 23:38.668
* *

23:38.710 --> 23:40.879
I'm gonna get to see Nate.

23:40.920 --> 23:42.505
I'm going to get him
to not sign that plea deal,

23:42.547 --> 23:44.424
but we gotta move fast.

23:44.466 --> 23:47.260
- What friend?
Do I know him?

23:47.302 --> 23:48.678
Is this a boyfriend?

23:48.720 --> 23:50.305
- No, no, he's just a friend.

23:50.347 --> 23:53.058
He's not just a friend,
but he's also not official.

23:53.099 --> 23:54.434
But I also don't think
I would've gotten through

23:54.476 --> 23:57.520
all this without him,
so yeah, maybe a boyfriend.

23:57.562 --> 23:59.314
Only he doesn't know it yet.

23:59.356 --> 24:00.857
So yeah.

24:00.899 --> 24:03.777
- That sounds confusing
but good.

24:10.575 --> 24:17.749
* *

24:22.587 --> 24:23.838
- What are you doing here?

24:23.880 --> 24:25.548
- Your mom gave me her spot.

24:25.590 --> 24:27.467
It was really nice of her.

24:27.509 --> 24:29.761
- Yeah, she was really nice
to that reporter, too,

24:29.803 --> 24:31.471
great interview.

24:31.513 --> 24:32.972
- Listen to me.
You can't take the plea deal.

24:33.014 --> 24:34.182
We think we know who did it.

24:34.224 --> 24:36.059
Ms. Avery had motive
this whole time.

24:36.101 --> 24:37.227
It was her.

24:37.268 --> 24:38.561
Cooper and I actually went
to her house.

24:38.603 --> 24:39.813
And we talked--
- Wait, you went to her house?

24:39.854 --> 24:41.564
And you think
she's a murderer?

24:41.606 --> 24:42.691
- Well, we had
to confront her.

24:42.732 --> 24:44.317
- Bronwyn, just stop!

24:44.359 --> 24:47.362
The plea's only four years
with good behavior.

24:47.404 --> 24:50.532
If I take it,
it's over for all of us.

24:50.573 --> 24:51.950
You can go back to your life.

24:51.991 --> 24:55.036
- I don't want to.
What if we make bail?

24:55.078 --> 24:57.997
- Don't even think about it.
- You can't give up.

25:02.127 --> 25:04.713
- You remember that
fourth grade nativity play

25:04.754 --> 25:07.382
at St. Pius?

25:07.424 --> 25:08.800
You were playing Mary,

25:08.842 --> 25:10.927
and that same morning,
baby Jesus disappeared.

25:10.969 --> 25:13.513
You had to carry the bag
wrapped in the blanket

25:13.555 --> 25:15.348
for the entire thing.

25:15.390 --> 25:18.059
That was me.

25:18.101 --> 25:20.937
Sorry I stole Jesus from you.

25:20.979 --> 25:23.273
- Why did you do it?

25:23.314 --> 25:26.276
- Because I wanted you
to see me,

25:26.317 --> 25:29.362
even if that meant
you'd be angry at me.

25:29.404 --> 25:31.197
Then I saw how angry you got,

25:31.239 --> 25:34.909
and I realized I'd ruined
the whole play for you.

25:34.951 --> 25:38.329
Because that's what I do.

25:38.371 --> 25:40.832
I'm not worth it, Rojas.
- No, no.

25:40.874 --> 25:42.375
- Go get ready
for the Ivy League,

25:42.417 --> 25:43.710
and I'll be doing whatever
the opposite of that is.

25:43.752 --> 25:46.796
- No, no, please!

25:46.838 --> 25:48.757
Just give me some time!
Please!

25:48.798 --> 25:54.054
* *

26:00.060 --> 26:02.771
- Okay, are you sure that
car is Hunter's, you said?

26:02.812 --> 26:04.981
- Mm-hmm, yeah, I'm positive.

26:05.023 --> 26:07.442
You don't forget that asshole
driving that asshole car

26:13.531 --> 26:15.283
Okay, don't freak out,

26:15.325 --> 26:16.618
but I think
you've been recognized.

26:16.659 --> 26:18.536
- Shit.

26:18.578 --> 26:19.913
- It's fine.

26:19.954 --> 26:22.457
Just act
like a perfectly normal,

26:22.499 --> 26:25.418
yet excessively cute couple
taking pictures.

26:25.460 --> 26:27.420
Ooh, we look good.

26:27.462 --> 26:31.257
- Are we?
A couple, I mean.

26:31.299 --> 26:36.012
- I don't know.
You tell me.

26:36.054 --> 26:37.889
Only time you've asked
to see me outside of my dorm

26:37.931 --> 26:39.224
is so that I can help you

26:39.265 --> 26:43.186
ID an unwitting accomplice
to murder for you.

26:43.228 --> 26:46.314
- Yeah, you know,
I've been thinking

26:46.356 --> 26:48.024
about all the different sides
of myself

26:48.066 --> 26:49.984
that I try to keep separate.

26:50.026 --> 26:51.736
You know, like,
there's Baseball Cooper.

26:51.778 --> 26:54.114
And there's School Cooper.
And there's At Home Cooper.

26:54.155 --> 26:55.782
And then there's
Murder Suspect Cooper.

26:55.824 --> 26:57.325
And then there's
Goes-to-his-stupid-

26:57.367 --> 26:58.910
Homecoming-Dance-
with-Keely-but-wishes-he-

26:58.952 --> 27:00.537
was-with-you Cooper.

27:00.578 --> 27:03.998
No, look, I'm serious.

27:04.040 --> 27:07.794
God, there's only one
Cooper who's happy.

27:07.836 --> 27:10.422
That's the one
who's with you.

27:10.463 --> 27:12.215
I want to be with you

27:12.257 --> 27:15.468
outside of your dorm room, too.

27:15.510 --> 27:18.263
I want to be all those Coopers
at the same time.

27:18.304 --> 27:20.432
I mean,
minus the murder suspect one,

27:20.473 --> 27:21.891
but you know what I mean.

27:21.933 --> 27:24.561
[soft music]

27:24.602 --> 27:29.774
- * Ooh, all I want to do
is dance with you *

27:29.816 --> 27:32.944
* Ooh *

27:32.986 --> 27:36.281
- Ooh, that's a good one.
I look good.

27:36.322 --> 27:39.784
- You look good.

27:39.826 --> 27:41.953
Wait, is that him?

27:41.995 --> 27:43.496
- Oh, my God, yeah.

27:43.538 --> 27:45.623
- Yeah?
- Yes.

27:45.665 --> 27:46.958
- Hunter.

27:47.000 --> 27:48.626
- Oh, fuck.

27:48.668 --> 27:51.755
[tense music]

27:51.796 --> 27:53.757
- Hey, hey!

27:53.798 --> 27:56.676
* *

27:56.718 --> 27:59.387
Hunter, Hunter, stop!

27:59.429 --> 28:01.431
* *

28:01.473 --> 28:03.391
Damn it, stop!

28:03.433 --> 28:05.894
Ah!

28:05.935 --> 28:08.229
Yo, hey, hey, hey!

28:08.271 --> 28:10.231
Hey, not my arm!
- Don't move!

28:10.273 --> 28:11.983
You're that star pitcher,
right?

28:12.025 --> 28:13.234
You want to keep it
that way,

28:13.276 --> 28:14.569
you leave me
the fuck alone

28:14.611 --> 28:16.780
- No, you leave him
the fuck alone.

28:16.821 --> 28:18.948
Back off.

28:18.990 --> 28:20.575
Never leave the house
without pepper spray

28:20.617 --> 28:21.993
when you're hanging out
with Hunter.

28:22.035 --> 28:23.536
Little tip I learned
from the girls

28:23.578 --> 28:24.871
I went to school with.

28:24.913 --> 28:26.164
- Kris, what the fuck
is happening?

28:26.206 --> 28:27.540
I didn't do anything,
all right?

28:27.582 --> 28:28.458
He's the dangerous one.

28:28.500 --> 28:29.459
- What are you
talking about?

28:29.501 --> 28:31.336
- You killed that kid.
- What?

28:31.378 --> 28:33.046
- All four of you,
you did it together.

28:33.088 --> 28:34.297
And now that they arrested
the drug dealer,

28:34.339 --> 28:35.215
you're trying
to cover your tracks,

28:35.256 --> 28:36.675
so you're not next, right?

28:36.716 --> 28:38.885
- No, not at all!

28:38.927 --> 28:41.346
- I swear
I haven't said a word.

28:41.388 --> 28:42.764
I'll give you
your money back, too.

28:42.806 --> 28:45.266
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.

28:45.308 --> 28:48.269
Did somebody pay you to streak
on the first day of school?

28:48.311 --> 28:49.813
- It wasn't you?
- No!

28:49.854 --> 28:52.107
And I think whoever it was
probably killed Simon,

28:52.148 --> 28:55.568
so I really need you
to tell me who hired you.

28:55.610 --> 28:57.862
- We answered a Reddit post,

28:57.904 --> 28:59.489
first day of school prank.

28:59.531 --> 29:01.533
They paid us on Venmo.
I never got a name.

29:01.574 --> 29:02.951
I just assumed
it was one of you.

29:02.992 --> 29:03.910
- Wait, you didn't go
to the police?

29:03.952 --> 29:05.078
- I didn't want them to know

29:05.120 --> 29:07.580
that I had anything
to do with it

29:07.622 --> 29:10.542
Look.

29:10.583 --> 29:13.712
That's the payment.
That's all I know, I swear.

29:13.753 --> 29:19.551
* *

29:19.592 --> 29:22.053
- Oh, my God, it's Simon!

29:22.095 --> 29:23.263
- Simon?
- Yeah.

29:23.304 --> 29:26.891
Anarchi$k, S-K.
It was his gamer tag.

29:26.933 --> 29:29.060
- So Simon wanted us
all in detention,

29:29.102 --> 29:30.854
and he hired the streakers?

29:30.895 --> 29:32.105
- I'm confused.

29:32.147 --> 29:33.481
Why would Simon want
to create a distraction?

29:33.523 --> 29:34.899
- To get Ms. Avery out
of her room.

29:34.941 --> 29:36.526
She was telling the truth.

29:36.568 --> 29:38.862
- The cup.
He left the cup on the table.

29:38.903 --> 29:40.321
And then he went to the window.

29:40.363 --> 29:41.698
That's when one of us could've
put the peanut oil in it.

29:41.740 --> 29:42.907
- What?

29:42.949 --> 29:44.159
- Without the streakers,

29:44.200 --> 29:45.201
none of us could
have had access to the cup.

29:45.243 --> 29:46.536
They were there to frame us.

29:46.578 --> 29:48.246
That was the plan.
He wanted to frame us.

29:48.288 --> 29:49.497
- Okay,
but why would he do that?

29:49.539 --> 29:52.334
- Because he hated us.
- No, not all of you.

29:52.375 --> 29:53.752
We actually felt bad for you.

29:53.793 --> 29:56.296
Even he thought you
deserved better than Jake.

29:56.338 --> 29:58.298
- If Simon orchestrated
this whole thing,

29:58.340 --> 30:00.967
then that means that...

30:01.009 --> 30:02.761
Janae, do you think...

30:02.802 --> 30:04.596
did Simon ever talk
about killing himself?

30:04.637 --> 30:05.764
- No, no.

30:05.805 --> 30:07.849
He would never do that.
That's not Simon.

30:07.891 --> 30:09.309
- Okay, if there's any chance

30:09.351 --> 30:10.685
that he could've done this
to himself,

30:10.727 --> 30:12.145
we have to tell the cops.

30:12.187 --> 30:13.980
Nate can't be jail for murder
if it wasn't murder.

30:14.022 --> 30:18.109
- Bronwyn, fuck off, okay?
I've had enough.

30:18.151 --> 30:20.070
You knew him, right?

30:20.111 --> 30:22.614
So you know
he wouldn't do that.

30:22.655 --> 30:24.532
Right?

30:24.574 --> 30:26.451
- Maeve?

30:26.493 --> 30:27.786
Maeve?

30:27.827 --> 30:30.622
Maeve, say something.

30:30.663 --> 30:32.290
You don't need to zoom.

30:32.332 --> 30:33.875
- I do need to zoom.

30:33.917 --> 30:35.168
- You didn't have to.

30:35.210 --> 30:37.462
- Oh, my God.

30:37.504 --> 30:39.381
How does it feel
to be the new poster boy

30:39.422 --> 30:41.549
for Bayview's
conservative youth?

30:41.591 --> 30:43.468
- [laughs]

30:43.510 --> 30:47.138
- Well,
this is just the beginning.

30:47.180 --> 30:51.017
Gonna be TV ads,
campaign events,

30:51.059 --> 30:52.811
smiling to be the perfect son

30:52.852 --> 30:55.230
for the perfect mayor
in this perfect town.

30:55.271 --> 30:58.149
And it's all a lie.

30:58.191 --> 31:02.070
I just can't wait to leave.

31:02.112 --> 31:03.822
Never come back.

31:03.863 --> 31:05.865
- I get that.

31:05.907 --> 31:08.868
But I actually had a disease.

31:08.910 --> 31:10.995
So I try not
to wish time away,

31:11.037 --> 31:13.665
even when things are shitty.

31:13.707 --> 31:16.126
- Are you trying to guilt me
with your cancer card?

31:16.167 --> 31:19.004
- Okay, it's literally
the only card I have.

31:19.045 --> 31:22.674
And I mean, come on.

31:22.716 --> 31:26.469
I'm sure there'd be
some things you'd miss

31:28.263 --> 31:31.349
- Maybe.
I do hate a lot of things.

31:31.391 --> 31:32.767
- Yeah, do you now?
- Yeah.

31:32.809 --> 31:35.520
- Mm, okay.
Then you'd miss hating them.

31:35.562 --> 31:39.149
I mean, hating on things
can be a lot of fun.

31:39.190 --> 31:43.820
I hate boats and boat people.

31:43.862 --> 31:47.240
- Sailors is what some
people would say but yeah.

31:47.282 --> 31:51.077
I hate milk alternatives.

31:51.119 --> 31:54.330
- Facebook moms.
- Keto diets.

31:54.372 --> 31:56.207
- I hate people who wear
puffy vests in the summer.

31:56.249 --> 31:57.375
Like, what is that?

31:57.417 --> 31:59.878
- Ripped jeans.
I hate ripped jeans.

31:59.919 --> 32:01.880
- Top 40 music.
- Mm, yes.

32:01.921 --> 32:03.256
- The worst.

32:06.509 --> 32:08.511
- I don't hate hating
things with you though.

32:12.098 --> 32:14.142
I think I'd miss that

32:14.184 --> 32:20.774
* *

32:20.815 --> 32:23.151
- I think that...

32:23.193 --> 32:26.738
* *

32:26.780 --> 32:30.867
I don't know.

32:30.909 --> 32:34.079
Maybe I didn't know him
like I thought I did.

32:34.120 --> 32:37.540
* *

32:37.582 --> 32:38.541
- Janae--

32:38.583 --> 32:39.584
- You're all fucking
wrong then.

32:39.626 --> 32:41.461
- Janae!

32:41.503 --> 32:45.173
Fuck.

32:45.215 --> 32:47.175
- You know
what we have to do.

32:47.217 --> 32:50.428
* *

32:50.470 --> 32:52.180
I mean,
it happened too fast.

32:52.222 --> 32:53.598
How could Nate have known

32:53.640 --> 32:55.183
that Simon was going
to create that distraction,

32:55.225 --> 32:56.810
and how could he put
the capsule in the cup

32:56.851 --> 32:58.436
in the few seconds
it took from the streakers

32:58.478 --> 33:00.230
to getting here
to us getting to the window?

33:00.271 --> 33:01.439
I mean, it was a setup.

33:01.481 --> 33:03.108
You can confirm with Ms. Avery.

33:03.149 --> 33:04.484
- We definitely will.

33:04.526 --> 33:06.444
- Will she get in trouble?

33:06.486 --> 33:08.613
- There could be civil
consequences, I'm sure.

33:08.655 --> 33:10.615
Maybe Vanessa's parents
could decide to sue.

33:10.657 --> 33:12.742
- Okay, but is it enough
to free Nate?

33:15.453 --> 33:17.455
- Is it enough to free Nate?

33:17.497 --> 33:19.124
- I mean,
if he killed himself, then--

33:19.165 --> 33:20.333
- No, we've ruled out suicide.

33:20.375 --> 33:22.460
We know he didn't kill himself.

33:22.502 --> 33:23.920
You might be surprised
to hear this,

33:23.962 --> 33:25.463
but there's actually parts
of this investigation

33:25.505 --> 33:26.923
you don't know about.

33:26.965 --> 33:28.383
I got people working on it
around the clock.

33:28.425 --> 33:30.051
I don't need your help.

33:30.093 --> 33:32.053
The only thing you did here
was get your teacher fired.

33:32.095 --> 33:34.139
Or worse.

33:34.180 --> 33:35.807
- But what about Nate?

33:35.849 --> 33:37.809
* *

33:37.851 --> 33:39.811
- If he's smart,
he's gonna take the plea deal.

33:39.853 --> 33:41.813
And if you're smart,
you're going to stand back

33:41.855 --> 33:43.064
and let me do my job

33:43.106 --> 33:44.816
before you cause
any more damage

33:44.858 --> 33:47.110
or get charged
with obstruction of justice

33:47.152 --> 33:50.321
and wind up with Nate in jail.

33:50.363 --> 33:52.115
We're done here.

33:52.157 --> 33:58.705
* *

34:10.008 --> 34:11.509
- That's our fault.

34:11.551 --> 34:13.345
Detective Wheeler's right.
We're making things worse.

34:13.386 --> 34:15.472
- Maybe we can figure out
who was stalking us.

34:15.513 --> 34:17.307
It has to be the same
person who framed Nate.

34:17.349 --> 34:18.350
- Bronwyn, the police said
there are things

34:18.391 --> 34:19.559
that we don't know.

34:19.601 --> 34:20.518
Maybe they have
more evidence against him.

34:20.560 --> 34:21.770
- Are you serious?

34:21.811 --> 34:23.563
- We've been wrong before,
Bronwyn,

34:23.605 --> 34:25.482
about a lot of things
at this point.

34:25.523 --> 34:27.442
- And I don't want
to be charged with obstruction.

34:27.484 --> 34:31.071
[phone dings]

34:31.112 --> 34:32.614
Shit, I have to go

34:32.655 --> 34:34.532
- Seriously,
you're just gonna go?

34:34.574 --> 34:36.326
- What else do you
want me to do?

34:36.368 --> 34:37.827
Look, Hunter almost
broke my arm today.

34:37.869 --> 34:40.038
I got lucky, but this is
my whole fucking future.

34:40.080 --> 34:41.456
- You think
I don't know what it's like

34:41.498 --> 34:42.874
to put everything on the line?

34:42.916 --> 34:45.043
I've been skipping classes,
missing exams.

34:45.085 --> 34:46.753
I have a fucking
personal statement for Yale

34:46.795 --> 34:48.588
to turn in,
and I haven't even started.

34:48.630 --> 34:49.923
- Maybe you should
get started then.

34:49.964 --> 34:51.424
Look, we've tried everything
that we can.

34:51.466 --> 34:53.259
I'm sorry, Bronwyn.

34:53.301 --> 34:56.221
[soft music]

34:56.262 --> 35:00.433
* *

35:00.475 --> 35:02.560
- Didn't you say it before,

35:02.602 --> 35:03.687
that Nate wouldn't want us

35:03.728 --> 35:06.940
to throw away
everything for him?

35:06.981 --> 35:09.234
I'm sorry

35:09.275 --> 35:16.366
* *

35:38.638 --> 35:40.348
- All right.
- I'll hook you up Sunday, man.

35:40.390 --> 35:42.308
- You good, man?
- Yeah, no worries.

35:42.350 --> 35:44.269
- Hey.

35:44.310 --> 35:46.896
- Hey.

35:46.938 --> 35:49.024
- You okay?

35:49.065 --> 35:51.860
* *

35:51.901 --> 35:55.196
- Really sorry we missed
the ice cream pop-up.

35:55.238 --> 35:58.450
- It's okay.

35:58.491 --> 36:02.746
- Jake, can we go home?

36:02.787 --> 36:04.039
- Does that mean you're done

36:04.080 --> 36:08.168
with all this
Scooby Doo stuff then?

36:08.209 --> 36:11.171
- Yeah.

36:11.212 --> 36:14.549
Yeah, I'm done

36:14.591 --> 36:16.426
- Come here.

36:16.468 --> 36:18.428
Come here, come here.

36:18.470 --> 36:25.560
* *

36:51.086 --> 36:54.047
- Dad, I'm sorry.
- You're too late.

36:54.089 --> 36:56.883
Traffic's too bad.
I already canceled.

36:56.925 --> 36:59.344
- You can't--why'd you--we
can reschedule though, right?

36:59.386 --> 37:00.595
I'm sorry!

37:00.637 --> 37:02.764
I just--I was playing
basketball

37:02.806 --> 37:03.890
with some of the guys,
I lost track of time.

37:03.932 --> 37:05.225
- You were just
playing basketball?

37:05.266 --> 37:06.643
- Yeah.

37:06.685 --> 37:08.853
- When are you gonna
stop lying to me?

37:08.895 --> 37:10.021
- What?

37:14.192 --> 37:17.195
- Is this who you were
playing basketball with?

37:17.237 --> 37:18.697
He tagged you in this photo.

37:18.738 --> 37:20.657
That means all of your
followers can see it.

37:20.699 --> 37:23.243
Recruiters, college teams,

37:23.284 --> 37:27.080
the reporter you were
supposed to meet with.

37:27.122 --> 37:31.292
- Wait, Dad,
is that why you canceled?

37:31.334 --> 37:33.086
- Just when this whole
Simon thing is starting

37:33.128 --> 37:35.088
to die down, right,
just when we can finally talk

37:35.130 --> 37:37.966
about baseball again,
you go on and pull this.

37:38.008 --> 37:39.217
- Dad, I'm sorry!

37:39.259 --> 37:40.552
I didn't know
that that would happen.

37:40.593 --> 37:42.595
- You are blowing it!

37:42.637 --> 37:45.765
We are this close, Coop.

37:45.807 --> 37:48.435
You gotta keep your head
in the game.

37:48.476 --> 37:49.853
That's if you still want it.

37:49.894 --> 37:55.442
- Of course I want it, Dad,
now more than ever.

37:55.483 --> 37:58.445
But you know what?

37:58.486 --> 38:02.490
* *

38:02.532 --> 38:05.326
I want to be myself, too.

38:05.368 --> 38:09.372
* *

38:09.414 --> 38:11.833
- Kiddo.

38:11.875 --> 38:15.754
I'm not trying
to tell you not to be you.

38:15.795 --> 38:20.884
I'm just--I'm trying
to tell you how things work.

38:20.925 --> 38:27.015
Tell your friend to take
the photo down, please.

38:27.057 --> 38:29.559
- Dad.

38:29.601 --> 38:32.020
He's not my friend.

38:32.062 --> 38:34.814
He's my boyfriend.

38:34.856 --> 38:37.484
And I am not telling him
to take it down.

38:37.525 --> 38:39.402
You want me to stop lying?

38:39.444 --> 38:42.280
This is where I stop lying.

38:42.322 --> 38:44.449
I want to play baseball.

38:44.491 --> 38:47.577
And I want to be out
while I do it.

38:47.619 --> 38:51.164
I think I'm that good.

38:51.206 --> 38:53.208
- Nobody's that good.

38:53.249 --> 38:58.004
* *

38:58.046 --> 38:59.756
- Alright.

38:59.798 --> 39:02.759
Well, I guess we'll find out.

39:02.801 --> 39:09.849
* *

39:09.891 --> 39:12.143
- I finished
my personal statement.

39:12.185 --> 39:13.770
Do you guys want to hear?

39:13.812 --> 39:15.897
- Of course we do.

39:17.857 --> 39:20.318
- In 11th grade, I faced one
of the biggest challenges

39:20.360 --> 39:23.905
I could imagine at the time,
AP chemistry.

39:23.947 --> 39:26.616
No matter how hard I worked,
how much I studied,

39:26.658 --> 39:29.285
I still found myself with a C.

39:29.327 --> 39:30.870
For as long as I can remember,

39:30.912 --> 39:33.790
I have defined myself
by my academic success.

39:33.832 --> 39:35.500
If I wasn't
a straight A student,

39:35.542 --> 39:37.210
I didn't know who I was.

39:37.252 --> 39:39.337
I was so desperate
to maintain my identity

39:39.379 --> 39:42.132
as a perfect student
that I stole exam questions

39:42.173 --> 39:44.384
from my Chemistry teacher,
and it worked.

39:44.426 --> 39:45.885
I got an A.

39:45.927 --> 39:48.054
So what did I learn
from the experience?

39:48.096 --> 39:51.224
How dangerous it is
to define yourself so rigidly.

39:51.266 --> 39:54.102
There are more sides to me
than just being a good student.

39:54.144 --> 39:56.855
I am brave.
I am determined.

39:56.896 --> 39:58.940
And I stand up for the people
I believe in,

39:58.982 --> 40:01.401
like my good friend Nate
who is currently in jail

40:01.443 --> 40:02.944
for a crime he didn't commit.

40:02.986 --> 40:05.780
And I know admitting all
of this is not gonna get me

40:05.822 --> 40:07.907
admitted into Yale,
but I've also learned

40:07.949 --> 40:09.451
that there are
more important things,

40:09.492 --> 40:12.120
like getting Nate out of jail.

40:12.162 --> 40:13.329
- Bronwyn, I--

40:13.371 --> 40:14.706
- Why did you write that?

40:14.748 --> 40:16.291
- Because it's the truth,

40:16.332 --> 40:20.045
and because I can't focus
on writing anything else

40:20.086 --> 40:22.380
while I know
Nate is sitting in jail.

40:22.422 --> 40:24.632
Maybe if we bailed him out?

40:24.674 --> 40:26.468
- So that's what this is about?

40:26.509 --> 40:29.137
- Okay, we only have to put up
10% of the whole bail,

40:29.179 --> 40:30.597
and I know there's way more
than that

40:30.638 --> 40:31.973
in my college fund--please.

40:32.015 --> 40:33.933
- Bronwyn, we've already
talked about this.

40:33.975 --> 40:35.435
There's still people
out there

40:35.477 --> 40:37.354
that think the four
of you were working together

40:37.395 --> 40:40.273
So no.
I'm sorry.

40:40.315 --> 40:42.942
- You have raised me
to stand up

40:42.984 --> 40:45.111
for what I believe in
and to never give up.

40:45.153 --> 40:46.780
Those were qualities
you admired

40:46.821 --> 40:49.032
when what I wanted was
to go to Yale.

40:49.074 --> 40:50.825
And I'm telling you what is
most important for me

40:50.867 --> 40:54.287
right now is helping Nate

40:54.329 --> 40:58.291
because I love him

40:58.333 --> 41:00.627
and because it's
the right thing to do

41:00.669 --> 41:02.754

41:02.796 --> 41:08.718
["The Office" theme playing]

41:11.805 --> 41:15.725

41:20.105 --> 41:23.400
Cool if I play RDR for a bit?

41:23.441 --> 41:26.027
- Cool if I fall asleep
while you play?

41:26.069 --> 41:27.946
- Only if you drool on me.

41:27.987 --> 41:30.240
- Oh, you missed it!
Admit it.

41:30.281 --> 41:32.826

41:34.452 --> 41:37.205
- Should we get tickets
to that thing some other time?

41:40.750 --> 41:43.503
You still want to go, right?

41:43.545 --> 41:47.507
- The ice cream thing.
Yeah, of course, of course.

41:47.549 --> 41:49.634
Soon, soon.

- Good evening.
How we doing?

42:23.251 --> 42:24.878
- Amazing,
I'm about to sign a deal

42:24.919 --> 42:27.172
admitting to a crime
I didn't commit.

42:27.213 --> 42:30.884
- So that means you don't
want to accept bail?

42:30.925 --> 42:32.719
- Sorry, what?

42:32.761 --> 42:34.721
- They didn't tell you?

42:34.763 --> 42:36.806
- Shit.

42:36.848 --> 42:38.933
- Not the reaction
I was expecting.

42:38.975 --> 42:41.311
But the deal's still
on the table regardless.

42:41.353 --> 42:44.439
Do you want to sign it,
or do you want to fight this?

42:44.481 --> 42:47.359
- Fucking Rojas.

42:47.400 --> 42:50.362
[dramatic music]

42:50.403 --> 42:57.327
* *

43:02.457 --> 43:06.086
- * Welcome
to your nightmare *

43:06.127 --> 43:09.923
* You're swimming
in some murky water *

43:09.964 --> 43:14.094
* It's coming out
of thin air *

43:14.135 --> 43:17.972
* Keep guessing, yeah,
you're getting hotter *

43:18.014 --> 43:20.850
* This is the beginning
of the end *

43:20.892 --> 43:28.024
* *

43:36.658 --> 43:39.577
* This is the beginning
of the end *

43:41.663 --> 43:48.586
* *
