Power and firebending
come from the breath,

He must be over
a hundred years old by now.

He's had a century
to master the four elements.

than basic firebending to defeat him.

that you show no fear

Isn't there someone
in your tribe who can teach you?

No. You're looking at the only waterbender
in the whole South Pole.

This isn't right.

up there, right?

who could teach you.
