NARRATOR:
Previously on Supernatural:

00:02.169 --> 00:03.587
Sammy.

00:03.671 --> 00:06.882
Take your brother outside
as fast as you can. Go!

00:10.845 --> 00:11.971
DEAN:
Dad's on a hunting trip.

00:12.221 --> 00:13.973
And he hasn't been home
in a few days.

00:16.934 --> 00:18.102
DEAN:
This is Dad's book.

00:18.310 --> 00:20.730
I think he wants us to pick up
where he left off.

00:20.938 --> 00:22.815
You know, saving people,
hunting things.

00:23.023 --> 00:24.191
The family business.

00:24.400 --> 00:26.986
I gotta find Dad.
It's the only thing I can think about.

00:36.746 --> 00:38.873
MAN (ON TV):
It's coming across the bridge.

00:39.165 --> 00:42.084
Hurry. Hurry!

00:49.592 --> 00:51.093
(CREAKING)

00:54.597 --> 00:56.557
(DOOR OPENING AND CLOSING)

01:23.000 --> 01:24.043
(RUSTLING)

01:45.981 --> 01:48.025
Ah! No! No!

01:48.317 --> 01:50.486
(SCREAMING)

01:55.783 --> 01:59.245
WOMAN: I know you're just doing your
job, but police have been here all week.

01:59.453 --> 02:01.914
I don't see why we have to
go through this again.

02:02.122 --> 02:05.000
The more he tells the story,
the more he believes it's true.

02:05.209 --> 02:06.669
Mrs. McKay...

02:07.711 --> 02:09.839
...we know you spoke
with local authorities.

02:10.047 --> 02:14.051
But this seems like a matter
for the state police. So....

02:14.260 --> 02:16.095
Don't worry how crazy it sounds, Evan.

02:16.345 --> 02:18.055
You just tell us what you saw.

02:18.722 --> 02:22.685
I was up late watching TV...

02:22.977 --> 02:25.479
...when I heard this weird noise.

02:26.522 --> 02:31.485
-What did it sound like?
-It sounded like a monster.

02:34.280 --> 02:37.283
Tell the officers
what you were watching on TV.

02:37.491 --> 02:39.493
Um...

02:39.743 --> 02:40.995
...Godzilla vs. Mothra.

02:41.245 --> 02:42.288
(DEAN CHUCKLING)

02:42.705 --> 02:44.373
That's my favorite Godzilla movie.

02:44.915 --> 02:47.918
-So much better than the original, huh?
-Totally.

02:48.127 --> 02:49.837
Yeah. He likes the remake.

02:50.254 --> 02:52.298
-Yuck.
-That's what I--

02:52.381 --> 02:54.091
(CLEARS THROAT)

02:55.634 --> 02:58.429
Evan, did you see
what this thing was?

02:58.846 --> 03:02.099
No. But I saw it grab Mr. Jenkins.

03:02.308 --> 03:05.185
-It pulled him underneath the car.
-Then what?

03:07.187 --> 03:08.397
It took him away.

03:10.149 --> 03:12.484
EVAN:
I heard the monster leaving.

03:12.943 --> 03:16.238
It made this really scary sound.

03:16.655 --> 03:18.115
What did it sound like, Evan?

03:19.283 --> 03:22.912
Like this whining growl.

03:26.206 --> 03:27.416
Thanks for your time.

03:32.338 --> 03:35.174
So the local police
have not ruled out foul play.

03:35.257 --> 03:37.593
Apparently, there were signs
of a struggle.

03:37.676 --> 03:40.346
You know, they could be right.
Could just be a kidnapping.

03:40.554 --> 03:42.556
Maybe this isn't our kind of gig.

03:42.681 --> 03:44.099
Yeah, maybe not.

03:44.183 --> 03:47.519
Except for this.
Dad marked the area, Dean.

03:47.686 --> 03:50.314
Possible hunting grounds
of a phantom attacker.

03:50.481 --> 03:52.107
Why would he even do that?

03:52.191 --> 03:54.193
Well, he found a lot of local folklore...

03:54.443 --> 03:56.820
...about a dark figure
that comes out at night...

03:57.071 --> 04:00.324
...grabs people, then vanishes.
He found this too:

04:00.950 --> 04:04.787
This county has more missing persons
per capita than anywhere in the state.

04:06.288 --> 04:08.624
-That is weird.
-Yeah.

04:08.832 --> 04:11.919
Don't phantom attackers usually
snatch people from their beds?

04:12.127 --> 04:13.837
Jenkins was taken from a parking lot.

04:14.088 --> 04:17.132
Well, there are all kinds.
Spring Heeled Jacks, phantom gassers.

04:17.216 --> 04:19.093
They take people anywhere, any time.

04:19.218 --> 04:21.470
I don't know
if this is our kind of gig either.

04:21.637 --> 04:24.348
Yeah, you're right.
We should ask around more tomorrow.

04:24.556 --> 04:26.016
Right.

04:27.184 --> 04:29.186
I saw a motel about five miles back.

04:29.395 --> 04:32.356
Whoa, whoa, easy.
Let's have another round.

04:33.190 --> 04:34.650
We should get an early start.

04:34.858 --> 04:38.028
You really know how to have fun,
don't you, Grandma?

04:39.363 --> 04:41.156
All right.

04:41.532 --> 04:44.201
I'll meet you outside.
I gotta take a leak.

05:07.558 --> 05:08.976
(RUSTLING)

05:28.370 --> 05:29.872
(SCREECHING)

06:30.224 --> 06:31.266
(CHATTERING)

06:31.517 --> 06:32.726
Hey. Hey.

06:32.935 --> 06:36.355
You guys been outside around here
in, like, the last hour or so?

06:37.231 --> 06:38.649
Sam!

06:41.485 --> 06:43.278
Sammy?

07:01.713 --> 07:03.340
Sam.

07:16.019 --> 07:18.814
WOMAN: So, what can we do for you,
Officer Washington?

07:19.022 --> 07:20.607
I'm working a missing persons.

07:21.024 --> 07:24.027
Didn't know the Jenkins case
was being covered by state police.

07:24.278 --> 07:26.822
Uh, no. No. This is someone else.

07:26.905 --> 07:28.407
Actually, it's my cousin.

07:28.490 --> 07:31.493
We were having a few last night
at this bar by the highway.

07:31.702 --> 07:32.870
I haven't seen him since.

07:33.620 --> 07:36.665
-Your cousin have a drinking problem?
-Sam?

07:36.874 --> 07:39.126
Two beers, and he's doing karaoke.

07:39.334 --> 07:40.794
He wasn't drunk. He was taken.

07:44.006 --> 07:46.091
All right. What's his name?

07:46.300 --> 07:47.926
Winchester.

07:48.886 --> 07:50.554
Sam Winchester.

07:50.804 --> 07:53.891
-Like the rifle?
-Like the rifle.

08:00.814 --> 08:02.649
WOMAN:
"Samuel Winchester."

08:02.858 --> 08:07.321
So you know that his brother,
Dean Winchester, died in St. Louis...

08:08.238 --> 08:11.074
...and was suspected of murder?

08:11.325 --> 08:13.535
Yeah, Dean.

08:13.744 --> 08:16.038
Kind of the black sheep of the family.

08:16.371 --> 08:18.749
-Handsome, though.
-Uh-huh.

08:22.377 --> 08:24.338
He's not showing up
in current reports.

08:24.546 --> 08:26.924
Oh, I already have a lead.

08:27.090 --> 08:28.800
I saw a surveillance camera
out by the highway.

08:28.884 --> 08:31.803
-Uh-huh. County traffic cam?
-Right. Yeah.

08:32.012 --> 08:35.891
I'm thinking the camera picked
up whatever took him. Or whoever.

08:37.476 --> 08:41.230
Well, I have access to the cam footage
down at the County Works Department.

08:41.939 --> 08:45.067
But, well, in the meantime,
let's do this the right way.

08:45.275 --> 08:50.781
Why don't you
fill out a missing persons report...

08:54.368 --> 08:56.745
...and sit tight over here?

08:56.954 --> 09:00.916
Officer, look, he's family.

09:01.333 --> 09:02.376
I kind of....

09:03.001 --> 09:05.921
I kind of look out for the kid.
You gotta let me go with you.

09:07.005 --> 09:08.757
I'm sorry. I can't do that.

09:10.384 --> 09:11.802
Well, tell me something.

09:12.010 --> 09:14.596
Your county has its fair share
of missing persons.

09:14.805 --> 09:16.932
Any of them come back?

09:18.350 --> 09:19.935
Sam's my responsibility.

09:20.102 --> 09:23.230
And he's coming back.
I'm bringing him back.

09:28.568 --> 09:30.028
(GASPING)

10:10.694 --> 10:13.822
Greg. I think we got something.

10:15.073 --> 10:17.492
These traffic cams take an image
every three seconds.

10:17.701 --> 10:19.453
It's part of the Amber Alert program.

10:19.661 --> 10:22.956
These images were all taken
around the time your cousin disappeared.

10:24.958 --> 10:28.378
-This really isn't what I'm looking for.
-Just wait. Wait. Next one.

10:28.587 --> 10:31.131
This one was taken
right after Sam left the bar.

10:31.381 --> 10:33.842
Look at the back end of that thing.

10:35.052 --> 10:36.636
Now look at the plates.

10:39.806 --> 10:42.017
The plates look new.
It was probably stolen.

10:42.142 --> 10:45.145
So whoever's driving that rust bucket
must be involved.

10:45.228 --> 10:47.105
(ENGINE SCREECHING)

10:52.861 --> 10:55.739
-Hear that engine?
-Yeah.

10:56.073 --> 10:59.117
Kind of a whining growl, isn't it?

10:59.659 --> 11:01.119
WOMAN:
Sure.

11:04.081 --> 11:05.624
I'll be damned.

11:18.136 --> 11:19.179
(GROANING)

11:20.889 --> 11:22.557
You're alive?

11:23.100 --> 11:24.684
-Huh?
-Hey, you okay?

11:25.018 --> 11:27.104
Does it look like I'm doing okay?

11:28.730 --> 11:31.775
-Where are we?
-I don't know.

11:32.067 --> 11:35.529
The country, I think.
Smells like the country.

11:36.154 --> 11:39.199
-You're Alvin Jenkins, aren't you?
-Yeah.

11:41.034 --> 11:42.577
Wow. I was looking for you.

11:42.786 --> 11:44.663
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah.

11:44.871 --> 11:48.083
Well, no offense,
but this is a piss-poor rescue.

11:48.583 --> 11:52.045
My brother's out there right now too.
He's looking for us. So....

11:52.254 --> 11:54.131
So he's not gonna find us.

11:54.214 --> 11:56.091
We're in the middle of nowhere...

11:56.216 --> 11:59.136
...waiting for them to come back
and do God knows what to us.

11:59.302 --> 12:03.098
-What are they? Have you seen them?
-What are you talking about?

12:03.306 --> 12:04.933
Whatever grabbed us.
What do they look like?

12:05.183 --> 12:06.226
(DOOR OPENING)

12:06.393 --> 12:07.519
See for yourself.

12:26.163 --> 12:29.958
Leave me alone. Don't you touch me.
You leave me alone!

12:46.975 --> 12:48.643
I'll be damned.

12:51.980 --> 12:54.524
-They're just people.
-Yeah.

12:54.733 --> 12:56.234
What did you expect?

12:57.235 --> 13:00.197
-How often do they feed you?
-Once a day.

13:00.405 --> 13:03.283
They use that thing over there
to open the cage.

13:04.576 --> 13:06.328
And that's the only time
you see them?

13:06.536 --> 13:08.663
So far. But I'm waiting.

13:09.164 --> 13:11.958
-Waiting for what?
-Ned Beatty time, man.

13:12.792 --> 13:15.337
-I think that's the least of your worries.
-Oh, yeah?

13:15.545 --> 13:18.089
-Yeah.
-What do you think they want, then?

13:18.298 --> 13:20.133
Depends on who they are.

13:20.342 --> 13:23.261
They're a bunch of psycho,
hillbilly rednecks, you ask me.

13:23.345 --> 13:26.181
Looking for love in all the wrong places.

13:30.310 --> 13:31.269
SAM:
Aah!

13:40.028 --> 13:42.489
Okay. The next traffic cam...

13:42.697 --> 13:45.700
...is 50 miles from here
and your pickup didn't pass that one.

13:45.909 --> 13:48.036
-So....
-It must have pulled off somewhere.

13:48.245 --> 13:50.247
I don't see any other roads here.

13:50.455 --> 13:54.251
A lot of these backwoods properties
have their own private roads.

13:54.793 --> 13:56.169
Great.

13:56.419 --> 13:57.879
(BEEPING)

14:09.182 --> 14:11.810
-So, Gregory?
-Yeah.

14:12.018 --> 14:13.270
I ran your badge number.

14:13.478 --> 14:16.147
It's routine when working a case
with state police...

14:16.356 --> 14:18.149
...for accounting purposes,
and what have you.

14:18.358 --> 14:19.192
Mm-hm.

14:19.401 --> 14:22.195
And, they just got back to me.

14:25.240 --> 14:26.908
Says here your badge was stolen.

14:28.326 --> 14:32.205
And there's a picture of you.

14:36.418 --> 14:39.713
I lost some weight. And I got
that Michael Jackson skin disease.

14:39.921 --> 14:42.299
Okay. Would you
step out of the car, please?

14:42.382 --> 14:44.426
Look, look, look.

14:45.260 --> 14:47.095
You want to arrest me? That's fine.

14:47.304 --> 14:49.306
I'll cooperate, I swear.

14:49.514 --> 14:52.892
But first, please, let me find Sam.

14:53.101 --> 14:54.561
I don't even know who you are.

14:54.769 --> 14:56.563
Or if this Sam person is missing.

14:56.771 --> 14:59.190
Look in my eyes and tell me
I'm lying about this.

14:59.399 --> 15:02.068
Identity theft?
You're impersonating an officer.

15:03.778 --> 15:05.363
Here's the thing.

15:05.488 --> 15:07.407
When we were young...

15:07.741 --> 15:09.701
...I pretty much pulled him from a fire.

15:11.870 --> 15:14.372
And ever since then,
I've felt responsible for him.

15:14.664 --> 15:18.251
You know, like it's my job
to keep him safe.

15:21.004 --> 15:24.174
I'm just afraid
if we don't find him fast....

15:26.343 --> 15:27.719
Please.

15:28.553 --> 15:30.347
He's my family.

15:32.390 --> 15:34.476
I'm sorry.

15:34.684 --> 15:36.102
You've given me no choice.

15:36.686 --> 15:39.272
I have to take you in.

15:52.952 --> 15:54.913
After we find Sam Winchester.

15:59.042 --> 16:02.128
ALVIN: What's your name again?
-It's Sam.

16:02.337 --> 16:05.465
Why don't you give it up, Sammy.
There's no way out.

16:05.548 --> 16:09.552
Don't call me Sammy.

16:10.970 --> 16:12.389
(COUGHING)

16:13.598 --> 16:15.016
What is it?

16:19.521 --> 16:20.939
It's a bracket.

16:21.147 --> 16:24.150
Oh, thank God, a bracket.
Now we got them, huh?

16:27.362 --> 16:29.322
Must have been a short.

16:32.367 --> 16:34.869
Maybe you knocked something loose.

16:38.748 --> 16:41.167
-I think you should get back in, Jenkins.
-What?

16:41.584 --> 16:44.379
-This isn't right.
-Don't you want to get out of here?

16:45.088 --> 16:47.048
Yeah, but that was too easy.

16:47.257 --> 16:49.884
I'm gonna get out of here.
Gonna send help. Don't worry.

16:50.093 --> 16:52.053
No. I'm serious. Jenkins.

16:52.262 --> 16:53.430
This might be a trap.

16:53.847 --> 16:55.473
Bye, Sammy.

16:56.182 --> 16:57.976
Jenkins!

17:37.432 --> 17:39.434
Thank you.

17:52.447 --> 17:54.240
(MAN LAUGHING)

18:30.860 --> 18:32.445
ALVIN:
Aah!

18:39.327 --> 18:40.495
(MAN LAUGHING)

19:04.602 --> 19:06.479
(SCREAMING)

19:13.319 --> 19:15.071
Okay, officer.

19:15.154 --> 19:18.950
-Look, I don't mean to press my luck.
-Your luck is so pressed.

19:19.158 --> 19:20.952
Right.

19:21.160 --> 19:25.039
I was wondering, why are you
helping me out anyway?

19:25.248 --> 19:26.624
Why don't you just lock me up?

19:29.002 --> 19:32.130
My brother Riley disappeared
three years ago.

19:32.338 --> 19:33.798
A lot like Sam.

19:34.757 --> 19:38.344
We searched for him, but nothing.

19:39.596 --> 19:44.267
I know what it's like to feel responsible
for someone, and for them....

19:47.312 --> 19:49.981
Come on. Let's keep at it.

19:53.484 --> 19:56.362
DEAN: Wait, wait, wait.
Pull over here. Pull over.

20:07.290 --> 20:09.834
This is the first turn-off
I've seen so far.

20:10.877 --> 20:13.671
-You stay here. I'll check it out.
-No way.

20:13.880 --> 20:15.298
Hey.

20:15.965 --> 20:20.386
You're a civilian. And a felon, I think.
I'm not taking you with me.

20:21.596 --> 20:23.056
You're not going without me.

20:26.392 --> 20:27.560
All right.

20:27.769 --> 20:31.689
You promise you won't get involved?
You'll let me handle it.

20:32.231 --> 20:34.859
-Yeah. I promise.
-Shake on it.

20:39.697 --> 20:41.449
Oh, come on.

20:42.867 --> 20:44.994
This is ridiculous.

20:45.203 --> 20:47.205
Kathleen, I think
you're gonna need my help.

20:47.288 --> 20:49.791
I'll manage, thank you.

20:54.212 --> 20:56.923
I gotta start carrying paperclips.

21:27.870 --> 21:29.455
Hello?

21:32.417 --> 21:34.502
Is anybody home?

21:49.475 --> 21:51.352
Hi.

21:52.061 --> 21:53.730
How are you?

21:59.485 --> 22:00.903
Who are you?

22:01.362 --> 22:06.659
I'm Kathleen, I'm a deputy.
What's your name?

22:07.326 --> 22:08.953
Missy.

22:09.287 --> 22:11.914
Missy. That's a pretty name.

22:12.123 --> 22:13.499
Missy, is your mom home?

22:14.250 --> 22:16.252
She's dead.

22:16.753 --> 22:18.880
I'm sorry. What about your dad?

22:20.965 --> 22:22.383
No?

22:24.385 --> 22:26.345
Can I come in for a minute?

22:27.764 --> 22:29.891
I just want you to look at a picture.

22:30.099 --> 22:32.351
You seen that guy?

22:34.771 --> 22:36.314
Look at that picture.

22:39.192 --> 22:42.278
-What?
-That's gonna hurt.

22:46.115 --> 22:47.408
Missy, sweetheart...

22:47.658 --> 22:49.660
...go tell your brothers
I wanna see them.

25:29.320 --> 25:30.488
Damn, it's good to see you.

25:32.657 --> 25:35.159
How did you get out of the cuffs?

25:35.826 --> 25:37.495
I know a trick or two.

-I don't know.

They let Jenkins go,
but that was some sort of trap.

26:06.023 --> 26:07.525
It doesn't make any sense to me.

26:07.775 --> 26:09.402
Yeah, well, that's the point.

You know, with our usual playmates,
there's rules. There's patterns.

26:16.617 --> 26:18.703
See anything else out there?

26:18.953 --> 26:22.915
Uh, there's a dozen junked cars out back.
Plates from all over.

26:23.124 --> 26:25.543

they take their car too.
