WEBVTT

00:02.036 --> 00:04.405
RUSH: This is what Destiny
 intended from the moment
 it entered the star system.

00:04.438 --> 00:08.176
YOUNG: That ship
 is the best chance
 we have of getting home.

00:08.209 --> 00:11.745
Are we done?
 We'll never be done.

00:11.779 --> 00:13.214
WRAY: You shouldn't have
 left him on the planet.

00:13.247 --> 00:15.149
YOUNG: You think
 I don't know that?

00:15.183 --> 00:16.750
CHLOE: Everyone thinks
 we're safe.

00:16.784 --> 00:18.919
They think that
 they'll never find us again.

00:18.952 --> 00:20.754
Why did you take
one of our people prisoner?

00:20.788 --> 00:22.223
(SNARLS)

00:22.256 --> 00:23.924
CHLOE: We're not safe,
 are we?

00:23.957 --> 00:25.993
TELFORD: They're coming!
 Who's coming?

00:26.026 --> 00:27.595
Lucian Alliance,
 they're coming to
 take Destiny.

00:27.628 --> 00:28.762
RUSH: There's only one way
 this is going to end
 if we wait.

00:28.796 --> 00:31.765
YOUNG: I'm not surrendering
 this ship.

00:31.799 --> 00:34.268
WRAY: They actually
 built this planet?

00:34.302 --> 00:37.004
ELI: That would make them
 the number-one all-time
 advanced civilization.

00:37.037 --> 00:38.739
SCOTT: Some of the people
 have decided

00:38.772 --> 00:40.941
that they would
 like to stay behind
 on the planet.

00:40.974 --> 00:43.244
CAINE: Whoever
 created this planet
 will provide for us.

00:43.277 --> 00:45.713
They are our best chance
 of getting back home.

00:45.746 --> 00:48.249
YOUNG: I am leaving
 the damaged shuttle behind.

00:48.282 --> 00:50.118
You can use it
 for shelter and power.

00:50.151 --> 00:52.886
All military personnel
 will return with me.

00:52.920 --> 00:54.222
My skin's changing.

00:54.255 --> 00:56.690
It's coarse.
 And it's growing.

00:56.724 --> 00:58.759
JOHANSEN:
 Our baby is still alive.

00:58.792 --> 01:01.129
Just because you want
 something to be true
 it doesn't mean it is, T.J.

01:07.435 --> 01:10.104
MORRISON: Hmm,
 not much to look at, is it?

01:10.138 --> 01:14.041
Well... Well,
 it depends what you see.

01:14.074 --> 01:17.445
I see a sign of
 intelligence that cannot
 possibly have been there

01:17.478 --> 01:20.448
by any current
 description of the universe,
 and yet, there it is.

01:22.816 --> 01:24.985
I see the greatest
 mystery of all time.

01:26.254 --> 01:27.821
Really?

01:27.855 --> 01:28.922
Look, if you can't
 fix that thing,

01:28.956 --> 01:30.158
I don't know what
we're doin' here.

01:30.191 --> 01:31.292
Keep your pants on.

01:33.794 --> 01:35.363
BRODY: Okay,
I got it this time.

01:40.268 --> 01:41.802
What?

01:41.835 --> 01:42.870
Nothing. Cheers.

01:49.042 --> 01:51.044
Brody, looks like we
 just came out of FTL.
 What's going on?

01:52.146 --> 01:53.914
This is Volker.

01:53.947 --> 01:56.250
Brody had to fix the still,
 so we switched shifts.

01:56.284 --> 01:57.418
I know you hate that.

01:57.451 --> 01:59.920
I don't care. Speak.

01:59.953 --> 02:01.855
Okay,
 well, we've got a couple of
 gate addresses popping up.

02:01.889 --> 02:03.724
Holy cow, do you see that?

02:06.394 --> 02:07.961
Yeah, I do.

02:12.566 --> 02:14.168
It looks like our shuttle.

02:14.202 --> 02:16.504
Yes, it does.

02:16.537 --> 02:18.906
Rush, this is Young.
Meet me on the bridge. Now.

02:25.579 --> 02:27.381
What's it doing?

02:27.415 --> 02:30.884
Nothing. It's just matching
our velocity off
the right side.

02:30.918 --> 02:32.220
Where did that thing
 come from?

02:32.253 --> 02:34.788
I don't know.
One minute it wasn't there,
the next minute it was.

02:34.822 --> 02:36.857
What's happened?

02:36.890 --> 02:37.758
It just came
out of nowhere.

02:39.827 --> 02:41.161
Is that the shuttle?

02:41.195 --> 02:42.763
YOUNG: Yeah,
 seems like it.

02:44.432 --> 02:46.166
(SNIFFS)

02:46.200 --> 02:48.436
No, I wasn't drinking,
 I was fixing it.

02:50.170 --> 02:55.576
CAINE OVER RADIO: Hello?
 Can anyone hear me? Hello?

02:55.609 --> 02:57.911
That sounds like Caine.

02:57.945 --> 02:58.846
Caine's more
monotone than that.

02:58.879 --> 03:00.248
He's also
 in another galaxy.

03:00.281 --> 03:01.915
Hello? This is Robert Caine.

03:04.084 --> 03:06.420
We can see the Destiny.
 What should we do?

03:06.454 --> 03:07.455
How?

03:13.361 --> 03:15.396
This is Colonel Young.
 As far as we know,

03:15.429 --> 03:18.031
Dr. Caine and a number
 of other people

03:18.065 --> 03:20.568
are on a planet thousands
 of light years away.

03:20.601 --> 03:24.037
CAINE: And as far as
 we remember, Colonel,
 that was where we still were

03:24.071 --> 03:25.939
when we went to sleep
 last night.

03:25.973 --> 03:28.041
Look, the shuttle
 we left you

03:28.075 --> 03:30.043
wasn't capable of
leaving the atmosphere,

03:30.077 --> 03:32.012
let alone fly
 between galaxies.

03:32.045 --> 03:35.583
We understand
 that, Dr. Rush,
 but here we are.

03:35.616 --> 03:36.950
YOUNG: The others
 are with you?

03:36.984 --> 03:39.186
Yes, all of us.

03:39.219 --> 03:41.955
Which brings me
 back to "how?"

03:43.991 --> 03:47.295
Honestly? I have no idea.

04:06.179 --> 04:07.381
Lieutenant Scott,
 report to the bridge.

04:07.415 --> 04:08.882
Yes, sir.

04:08.916 --> 04:10.451
How could they have
 known when or where

04:10.484 --> 04:12.320
we were going to
 come out of FTL?

04:12.353 --> 04:15.589
Or for that matter,
 drop them right beside us?
 This is impossible.

04:15.623 --> 04:17.958
There they are.
If it's them.

04:17.991 --> 04:19.293
YOUNG: That's
 a fair question.

04:19.327 --> 04:20.661
Do you think that
we could electronically

04:20.694 --> 04:22.330
compare the voice
we are getting

04:22.363 --> 04:23.997
from the shuttle to
 an old Kino recording
 of Caine?

04:24.031 --> 04:27.067
Okay, trust me,
 these aliens built
 a planet from scratch

04:27.100 --> 04:29.303
and can just throw a shuttle
 between galaxies.

04:29.337 --> 04:32.139
I'm pretty sure
 they could impersonate
 Caine if they wanted to.

04:32.172 --> 04:33.341
Boone used to do
 a pretty good Caine.

04:33.374 --> 04:34.508
I thought it was
 the other way around.

04:34.542 --> 04:36.577
So, what, we take them
 for their word?

04:36.610 --> 04:38.646
They are who
 they say they are,
 and ignore the possibility

04:38.679 --> 04:41.315
that this could be a ruse
 to get by our defenses?

04:41.349 --> 04:43.317
Like a Trojan horse?

04:43.351 --> 04:44.585
Well, the truth is,
 with aliens that can
 do this,

04:44.618 --> 04:46.654
defenses are meaningless.

04:46.687 --> 04:49.423
Wouldn't mind having
 a working shuttle again.

04:49.457 --> 04:52.259
There is that.
 I suggest we invite them

04:52.292 --> 04:54.962
on board and take
 every precaution.

04:58.031 --> 05:00.368
Sorry for the delay,
 Dr. Caine.

05:00.401 --> 05:02.135
I've asked Lieutenant Scott
 to come and help

05:02.169 --> 05:04.204
talk you through
 the docking procedure.

05:04.237 --> 05:06.039
CAINE: I don't
 even drive a car.

05:06.073 --> 05:07.975
BRODY: Just what
 a Trojan would say.

05:08.008 --> 05:09.109
The guys in
 the horse were Greek.

05:09.142 --> 05:10.210
Well, why is it
 "Trojan" horse, then?

05:10.243 --> 05:11.311
Because that's what...

05:11.345 --> 05:12.380
They're from Troy.

05:12.413 --> 05:14.047
YOUNG: Are you guys done?

05:14.081 --> 05:15.649
Don't worry, Dr. Caine,
 we'll take it nice and slow.

05:23.090 --> 05:24.692
This is Greer.
 Ready and standing by.

05:25.593 --> 05:27.227
I am on my way.

05:27.260 --> 05:28.962
Is it them?
 I just ran into Eli.

05:28.996 --> 05:31.164
Well, Eli's got a big mouth.
 You don't need to be here.

05:31.198 --> 05:32.466
Try and stop me.
 Listen to me, T.J.,

05:32.500 --> 05:34.502
I know what you
 must be thinking...
 You should have told me...

05:34.535 --> 05:36.069
What you experienced
 was a simulation,
 we know that.

05:36.103 --> 05:38.572
No, you know that.

05:38.606 --> 05:41.742
Look, I'm just saying,
 if they can send
 our people back to us,

05:41.775 --> 05:43.577
don't you think
 it's possible they could
 save our daughter?

05:43.611 --> 05:45.646
Nobody mentioned a child.

05:45.679 --> 05:47.114
I don't want you
 to set yourself up.

05:48.115 --> 05:49.249
I need to know.

05:56.256 --> 05:58.592
All right, Dr. Caine,
 what we want now

05:58.626 --> 06:02.062
is one short burst
 from the forward
 maneuvering thrusters

06:02.095 --> 06:04.565
just to set her down,
 and we are home.

06:04.598 --> 06:05.699
Just a kiss, now.

06:08.636 --> 06:12.105
All right, good.
 Good job. You got it.

06:12.139 --> 06:14.575
I can lock
you down from here.
Stand by for egress.

06:14.608 --> 06:15.976
(WHIRRING)

06:18.145 --> 06:19.713
Docking clamps
 in place, sir.

06:19.747 --> 06:20.981
Thank you, Lieutenant.

06:35.496 --> 06:36.497
Hi.

06:37.831 --> 06:40.133
Colonel Young.

06:40.167 --> 06:42.470
This must be just as much
 a surprise to you.

06:42.503 --> 06:44.638
You have no idea.

06:44.672 --> 06:47.641
You will exit the shuttle
 one person at a time.

06:47.675 --> 06:51.311
Sergeant Greer and members
of his team will escort you
to a holding area.

06:51.344 --> 06:55.616
Move quickly,
talk to no one,
touch nothing.

06:55.649 --> 06:59.319
I don't understand.
 You know us.
 We're not a threat.

06:59.352 --> 07:01.489
And I'm glad to hear that.
 Sergeant.

07:01.522 --> 07:03.691
After you. Sir.

07:09.497 --> 07:11.098
One at a time, please.

07:20.340 --> 07:21.374
Peter!

07:22.710 --> 07:23.711
Val!

07:45.733 --> 07:47.067
You all right?

07:48.569 --> 07:49.670
I'm fine.

08:02.583 --> 08:03.817
I'm losing Chloe.

08:08.522 --> 08:14.261
I mean, she's losing herself,
 and we can't stop it.

08:16.429 --> 08:17.765
(DOOR OPENING)

08:19.533 --> 08:21.468
Hi.
 Hey.

08:21.501 --> 08:23.671
Did you hear the news?

08:23.704 --> 08:26.540
Dr. Caine and the bunch
 that stayed back

08:26.574 --> 08:27.775
on that planet,
 they came back.

08:29.276 --> 08:31.211
How?
 Hell if I know.

08:31.244 --> 08:34.615
They don't even know.
 I guess we'll find out.

08:37.551 --> 08:39.720
We've got
 a shuttle again, though,
 so you gotta like that.

08:43.624 --> 08:44.925
Can I get you anything?

08:44.958 --> 08:46.293
No.
 Okay.

08:50.363 --> 08:53.266
You're trying so hard,

08:53.300 --> 08:55.468
but every time
 I look at your face,
 you can't hide it.

08:56.704 --> 08:57.871
What?

08:57.905 --> 09:00.407
That you're not
 looking at me anymore,

09:00.440 --> 09:02.776
at least not as
 the person I used to be.

09:02.810 --> 09:04.411
You see the other.
 Chloe...

09:04.444 --> 09:10.217
No, it's just your
 inability to lie, Matthew.

09:12.319 --> 09:16.757
It's one of
 the best things about you,
 but I know what you see.

09:18.258 --> 09:19.459
I see it, too.

09:23.496 --> 09:25.398
This is new this morning.

09:27.635 --> 09:28.969
We're gonna fix this.

09:29.002 --> 09:30.303
I don't even know
 if I want you to.

09:30.337 --> 09:31.438
Yeah, you do.

09:31.471 --> 09:34.742
I'm hardly
 blacking out anymore.

09:34.775 --> 09:37.945
The new part
 of me is just there,
 in the foreground.

09:39.613 --> 09:40.948
I'm not afraid
of it anymore.

09:40.981 --> 09:41.949
You have to fight it.

09:44.685 --> 09:45.686
I think we're past that.

09:48.689 --> 09:49.923
YOUNG: So that's the last
 thing you remember,

09:49.957 --> 09:51.558
going to sleep
 in the shuttle?

09:51.591 --> 09:54.828
And that it was cold,
 it was winter.

09:54.862 --> 09:56.897
We were using it
as a shelter.

09:56.930 --> 09:59.432
I remember closing my eyes,

09:59.466 --> 10:05.639
and then we
 were delivered here
 by a greater power.

10:05.673 --> 10:07.841
YOUNG: The aliens
 who created the planet,
 you mean.

10:07.875 --> 10:09.943
Or by Providence.

10:09.977 --> 10:12.512
Are you suggesting
 that God did this?

10:12.545 --> 10:13.446
Is that you, Camile?

10:14.314 --> 10:15.683
Yes.

10:15.716 --> 10:17.918
It's nice
 to hear your voice.

10:17.951 --> 10:21.621
Well, of course
 there's no way of knowing
 His will,

10:21.655 --> 10:25.793
but I do know that
 I prayed every night
 before I went to sleep

10:25.826 --> 10:27.427
that He would keep us safe.

10:27.460 --> 10:29.429
So, magic then.

10:29.462 --> 10:31.699
You have to admit
 that our arrival here

10:31.732 --> 10:34.634
is nothing less
 than miraculous, Eli.

10:34.668 --> 10:36.536
"Any sufficiently
 advanced technology

10:36.569 --> 10:37.705
"is indistinguishable
 from magic,"

10:37.738 --> 10:39.306
Arthur C. Clarke.

10:39.339 --> 10:40.974
"Turn the mic back on."
 Winston Churchill.

10:42.009 --> 10:42.910
Really?

10:45.679 --> 10:46.680
Are you going
 to keep us here?

10:46.714 --> 10:48.048
We haven't done anything.

10:48.081 --> 10:49.449
Try to be patient.

10:49.482 --> 10:50.784
You'll be released
 once you've all undergone

10:50.818 --> 10:52.585
a physical examination
 one at a time.

10:54.321 --> 10:56.023
But we're perfectly fine.

10:56.056 --> 10:58.692
Well, forgive me
 if I don't take your word
 for that.

10:58.726 --> 11:01.729
The more answers we have,
 the less precautions
 we'll have to take.

11:01.762 --> 11:02.730
Let's keep an eye on them.

11:08.401 --> 11:09.336
What do you think?

11:11.371 --> 11:13.340
Well, it appears to have been
 completely restored.

11:13.373 --> 11:14.908
Brand spankin' new,
 more like it.

11:14.942 --> 11:16.977
Every part, every system,

11:17.010 --> 11:19.379
every square inch
 of this thing is in
 perfect factory condition.

11:19.412 --> 11:20.881
Even has that
 new shuttle smell.

11:21.882 --> 11:24.651
Again, how?

11:24.684 --> 11:27.420
Well, I don't know,
 but it could be invaluable
 to the mission.

11:27.454 --> 11:29.089
So, nothing to be
 concerned about?

11:29.122 --> 11:31.424
No ticking time bombs?
 Alien transmissions?

11:31.458 --> 11:33.293
No, sir.
 At least not yet, anyway.

11:34.127 --> 11:35.395
Let's keep looking.

11:38.732 --> 11:40.067
They're all
 in perfect health.

11:40.100 --> 11:42.535
No trace of disease
or malnutrition.

11:42.569 --> 11:44.537
Just like the day
we left them.

11:44.571 --> 11:46.106
What are the odds of that?

11:46.139 --> 11:47.941
Eight adults
 who've been through
 what they've been through?

11:47.975 --> 11:51.011
You know, not one of them
remembers a damn thing
about the planet,

11:51.044 --> 11:52.545
or how they got here.

11:52.579 --> 11:54.047
Well, Caine believes
 that's God's way

11:54.081 --> 11:55.883
of telling them
 they've been reborn.

11:55.916 --> 11:59.352
Was that before or after
 He gave them amnesia?

11:59.386 --> 12:02.790
The others think that maybe
the aliens discovered them

12:02.823 --> 12:04.691
and returned them to us
 as an act of benevolence.

12:04.724 --> 12:06.693
Well, that's nice.

12:06.726 --> 12:07.961
You're not buying it?

12:07.995 --> 12:09.797
No, these aliens
 are too damn powerful.

12:09.830 --> 12:12.599
I mean, building planets,
 rebuilding shuttles?
 They could...

12:12.632 --> 12:14.401
They could squash us
 like ants if they wanted to.

12:16.003 --> 12:17.805
That scares you?
Yes.

12:17.838 --> 12:19.372
But what scares me
 even more is the feeling

12:19.406 --> 12:20.640
I got when I looked him
 in the eye.

12:20.673 --> 12:22.042
I thought it was just me.

12:22.075 --> 12:23.343
I should be welcoming them
 with open arms,

12:23.376 --> 12:26.914
but I can't be in
a room with any of them
for more than a minute

12:26.947 --> 12:28.481
before I want to
 get the hell away.

12:28.515 --> 12:29.783
Why?

12:29.817 --> 12:30.951
I don't know,
but I want to find out.

12:33.854 --> 12:34.788
ELI: Go ahead.

12:36.123 --> 12:38.458
Okay. Um...

12:40.961 --> 12:44.798
I don't know how
 much longer I'm going
 to be me.

12:44.832 --> 12:47.000
It's kind of hard
 to explain...

12:47.034 --> 12:49.102
ELI: You don't have to.
 Everybody understands.

12:50.203 --> 12:51.504
So I should just do this?

12:51.538 --> 12:52.439
ELI: Yeah.

12:54.441 --> 12:56.009
Who should I start with?

12:56.043 --> 12:58.778
Somebody easy.
 I'm right here.
 Start with me.

13:00.180 --> 13:01.448
Okay.

13:06.553 --> 13:10.723
Eli, you've been the most...

13:14.194 --> 13:18.031
Wait, what do you mean
 start with someone easy?

13:18.065 --> 13:20.133
You're the hardest
 to say goodbye to
 out of everyone!

13:20.167 --> 13:24.571
ELI: Okay, okay,
 pick somebody else. Chloe?

13:26.974 --> 13:27.740
Chloe!

13:30.677 --> 13:33.546
YOUNG: You can all return
 to your original quarters.

13:33.580 --> 13:35.682
You will be given
 a list of duties
 to help carry your weight

13:35.715 --> 13:37.851
as members of this crew.

13:37.885 --> 13:39.719
Is this as close
 as we're going to get
 to "welcome aboard"?

13:39.752 --> 13:41.855
Yeah, it is.
 Right now I don't have

13:41.889 --> 13:43.823
any reason to treat you
like prisoners.

13:43.857 --> 13:45.725
Thank you.
Don't give me a reason.

14:13.286 --> 14:15.022
Hey. (CHUCKLES)

14:16.924 --> 14:19.993
Young finally let us out.

14:20.027 --> 14:22.963
Yeah, that's good.
 I've got a shift
 in hydroponics.

14:25.565 --> 14:26.699
What's wrong?

14:27.567 --> 14:28.902
Don't touch me.

14:32.539 --> 14:34.774
What was that all about?

14:34.807 --> 14:37.110
I see
 you haven't spent time
 with the new arrivals.

14:38.278 --> 14:40.080
No.

14:40.113 --> 14:44.784
GREER: Eight science types,
no survival skills.

14:44.817 --> 14:47.620
I've seen a lot of people
 go in my time

14:47.654 --> 14:49.789
and I know
 I'm going to see more
 before I'm done here.

14:51.992 --> 14:56.796
I have never seen
anyone come back.
Until now.

14:58.831 --> 15:00.633
Okay, you're being
 too deep again.

(INDISTINCT CHATTERING)

Hi.

15:13.680 --> 15:15.949
Hey. Good morning.

15:15.983 --> 15:18.051
We were just remarking
 at how different

15:18.085 --> 15:19.852
the food tastes
 here than on Eden.

15:22.155 --> 15:24.824
That's what
 we called the planet.

15:24.857 --> 15:26.126
I hope you stayed away
 from the apples.

15:26.159 --> 15:27.794
Right.

15:27.827 --> 15:30.663
We're actually
 growing more and more
 of our own food.

15:30.697 --> 15:33.166
If you like,
 I could show you.

15:33.200 --> 15:34.634
Yeah.

15:38.005 --> 15:39.672
Incredible.

15:39.706 --> 15:41.608
JOHANSEN: It's a start.

15:41.641 --> 15:44.011
Soon it'll
 be a garden.

15:44.044 --> 15:47.647
I wanted to talk to
 you about something.
 I... I have a memory.

15:48.315 --> 15:49.616
Well, lucky you.

15:50.984 --> 15:54.087
A vivid memory
 that I visited you

15:54.121 --> 15:57.224
on the planet
with my daughter.

16:00.027 --> 16:02.029
Your daughter?

16:02.062 --> 16:04.331
When we first
 arrived at the planet,
 I was pregnant, remember?

16:05.298 --> 16:07.600
I do remember.

16:07.634 --> 16:10.870
It was winter,
 and you were living
 in cabins.

16:10.903 --> 16:12.005
You told me that
 they were provided

16:12.039 --> 16:14.374
by the aliens
 who created the planet.

16:14.407 --> 16:16.276
I told you?

16:16.309 --> 16:20.780
And that
 my daughter was safe,

16:20.813 --> 16:21.914
and you would
 take care of her.

16:26.086 --> 16:29.922
I don't remember
 anything like that,
 Tamara. I'm sorry.

16:30.857 --> 16:31.991
I wish I did.

16:33.726 --> 16:34.861
It was so real.

16:41.068 --> 16:42.669
How about the day
 before that?

16:42.702 --> 16:44.804
Let's say in the morning
 when you woke up.

16:44.837 --> 16:47.374
Was it raining, snowing?

16:47.407 --> 16:48.775
I don't know.

16:50.410 --> 16:53.846
Doesn't it bother you that
you don't remember anything

16:53.880 --> 16:55.182
but the most
 generic things

16:55.215 --> 16:57.084
from your experience
 on that planet?

16:57.117 --> 17:00.753
Just gathering
 food and fuel?

17:00.787 --> 17:04.090
Maybe that's all we did.

17:04.124 --> 17:07.627
Oh, come on, Peter.
 You have to remember
 more than that.

17:08.795 --> 17:10.196
You were there for months.

17:14.467 --> 17:16.336
I could show you
 some of the others,

17:16.368 --> 17:18.271
but the conversation
 is more or less the same.

17:18.305 --> 17:21.840
So you think their memories
have been tampered with?

17:21.874 --> 17:24.911
I guess it could be
 a side effect of
 whatever mechanism

17:24.944 --> 17:25.978
transported them here,

17:27.314 --> 17:29.449
but I'm starting
 to think that maybe

17:29.482 --> 17:32.885
the aliens
 didn't want our people
 to remember something.

17:32.919 --> 17:35.255
The whole thing to me
feels like a damn
science experiment.

17:36.889 --> 17:38.891
They're still our people.

17:38.925 --> 17:41.861
They don't creep you out?
 Even a little?

17:41.894 --> 17:44.030
Well, a lot of people
 creep me out a little,

17:44.063 --> 17:45.898
so I'm not
 the best person to ask.

17:46.933 --> 17:48.435
Really?
 A little.

17:50.170 --> 17:51.138
Me?

17:52.139 --> 17:54.040
Not as much now.

17:54.073 --> 17:57.110
Hmm, that's good. Progress.

17:57.144 --> 17:59.179
Well, keep at it.
They've got to
remember something.

 go see Chloe?

Go.

All right, look,
 she's alone in there
 all damn day.

18:40.487 --> 18:42.489
The only time
 she's got company
 is when I come to see her.

18:42.522 --> 18:44.857
That must be hard for her.

18:44.891 --> 18:47.126
I'm just sayin'
 it wouldn't hurt, you know,
 if people went to see her.

18:47.160 --> 18:49.829
She's alone for a reason.

18:49.862 --> 18:52.365
I mean, whether you want
 to admit it or not,

18:52.399 --> 18:54.834
there's a freak
show going on in there.

18:54.867 --> 18:56.269
You are outta line, Greer.

18:56.303 --> 18:58.805
No, sir, I'm not,
 because it is part
 of my job

as a Master Sergeant
 to see to it

Okay, Master Sergeant,
 you tell me

19:18.325 --> 19:20.026
what is so wrong with
 giving that girl comfort

19:20.059 --> 19:21.494
in what might be
 her last few days?

19:21.528 --> 19:24.063
Because you don't know
 when that day's gonna be.

19:24.096 --> 19:25.398
You don't know how much
 I care about her.

19:25.432 --> 19:30.470
I think I do,
 and you're not
 the only one.

19:30.503 --> 19:33.540
I pray for her
every single night,

19:33.573 --> 19:36.276
but that girl is
 turning into the enemy.

 it's coming back.

 memory came back to me

Yes, we have.

In search of a message
 from the moment of creation.

 about "message."

a better word.

 may have had a hand
 in all of this.

(SCOFFS) I don't
 know about that either,
 I'm afraid. I'm a scientist.

 as to call it evidence

of an intelligence
 having existed

prior to its own
potential to exist.

 yourself to call it

 to hear more.

Call it God's will
 and you needn't give
 it another thought.

22:58.077 --> 23:01.047
He must have brought us
 here for a reason.

23:01.080 --> 23:03.015
He must have
 saved us for a reason.

23:03.049 --> 23:08.120
Yeah, saved from what?
 Do you remember?

23:08.154 --> 23:10.189
I mean, the burning bush
 spoke to Moses?

23:10.222 --> 23:13.726
Gabriel, was it,
 spoke to Abraham, yet you,

23:13.760 --> 23:15.528
you were returned here
 with no proof

23:15.562 --> 23:17.063
of your savior
 one way or the other.

23:19.766 --> 23:21.000
I'll leave you
 to your work.

23:25.505 --> 23:27.373
Let me ask you...

23:27.406 --> 23:31.043
The shuttle was restored
 to its original condition

23:31.077 --> 23:32.479
by the aliens
 who sent you here,

23:32.512 --> 23:34.614
better than
 it was before, even.

23:34.647 --> 23:38.084
Well, that sounds
 to me more like the work
 of God than aliens.

23:38.117 --> 23:40.052
Well, if this shuttle
 has been restored
 so perfectly,

23:40.086 --> 23:42.388
then why weren't
 all of you?

23:42.421 --> 23:45.391
I mean, Norris wasn't born
 with astigmatism, was he?

23:45.424 --> 23:47.760

had a full head of hair
at one time.

23:49.496 --> 23:51.698
All of you
 have enormous gaps
 in your memory.

23:52.665 --> 23:54.266
What's your point?

23:54.300 --> 23:56.503
Well, either
 He's lost his touch,

23:56.536 --> 23:58.437
or God's got nothing
 to do with this.

24:00.206 --> 24:02.041
Rush, this is Young.
 Is Caine with you?

24:03.375 --> 24:05.411
Yeah, go ahead.

24:05.444 --> 24:06.679
Tell him to come
 to the infirmary.
 Val is dead.

24:12.318 --> 24:13.620
JOHANSEN: It was
 a severe head trauma,

24:13.653 --> 24:15.588
as bad as if she was struck
 with a sledgehammer.

24:15.622 --> 24:17.790
There's nothing
 anyone could've done.

24:17.824 --> 24:20.126
What happened?
 YOUNG: Nothing.

24:20.159 --> 24:22.461
She just grabbed her head,
 and her nose started
 to bleed.

24:22.495 --> 24:24.363
Are you sure?

24:24.396 --> 24:26.332
She was just
 talking with Eli in
 the observation room.

24:26.365 --> 24:27.834
There were witnesses.

24:27.867 --> 24:30.136
YOUNG: She was already dead
 when we got there.

24:30.169 --> 24:33.105
And still there's
 evidence of skull fracture,
 hemorrhage, brain swelling.

24:33.139 --> 24:35.508
I don't understand.
YOUNG: Neither do we.

24:35.542 --> 24:39.546
Something caused this.
 A blunt force injury doesn't
 happen spontaneously.

24:39.579 --> 24:41.380
Something that
happened on the planet?

24:44.651 --> 24:48.187
I don't know.
 I wish I did, I swear.

24:48.220 --> 24:49.889
Look, this might be
a long shot,

24:49.922 --> 24:52.391
but I'd like to put you
and the others

24:52.424 --> 24:54.393
from the shuttle
 under hypnosis.

24:54.426 --> 24:56.829
See if I can
stimulate memories
from your subconscious.

24:56.863 --> 24:58.665
The IOA teach you that?

24:58.698 --> 25:00.332
Yeah, they did.

25:00.366 --> 25:01.901
Anything else
 I should know about?

25:01.934 --> 25:03.770
That I was a little
 overqualified for HR?

25:05.905 --> 25:06.839
I say we do it.

25:08.440 --> 25:10.777
I'd like to tell the others
about Val first.

25:11.778 --> 25:12.845
Yeah, of course.

25:15.748 --> 25:18.250
In the meantime,
 I'll take a shot
 at an autopsy.

25:18.284 --> 25:19.719
Maybe I missed something
 in the observation.

25:19.752 --> 25:21.654
I don't think
 you missed anything.

25:21.688 --> 25:24.523
I don't think so either,
 but I don't really know
 what else I can do.

25:24.557 --> 25:26.458
Hey, listen,
 you're doing good.

25:27.627 --> 25:28.728
Actually, I'm not.

25:36.603 --> 25:38.270
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

25:38.871 --> 25:39.806
Come in.

25:47.279 --> 25:48.147
How are you?

25:49.582 --> 25:52.251
Still me. Mostly, anyway.

25:53.820 --> 25:55.521
Good to know.

25:55.554 --> 25:57.790
Once I've
 changed completely,

25:57.824 --> 26:00.727
the Colonel
 will see me as a threat,
 won't he?

26:02.494 --> 26:03.663
I think so.

26:05.564 --> 26:06.666
What will he do?

26:08.300 --> 26:09.168
Remove the threat.

26:11.503 --> 26:12.839
One way or another.

26:13.673 --> 26:14.841
Will it be you?

26:15.975 --> 26:18.911
Yes, ma'am. I think so.

26:23.816 --> 26:24.917
I'm sorry.
 Don't be.

26:27.419 --> 26:28.688
I couldn't let
 it be anyone else.

26:31.523 --> 26:32.759
Is that what
 you came to tell me?

26:34.794 --> 26:36.428
I came to ask
 for your forgiveness,

26:38.831 --> 26:40.532
for when the time
 does come.

26:42.434 --> 26:43.736
Of course.

26:43.770 --> 26:45.471
If I could
please hear you say it.

26:48.675 --> 26:49.976
I forgive you, Ronald.

26:52.478 --> 26:53.780
Thank you.

26:55.815 --> 26:57.283
That's important.

27:00.687 --> 27:02.521
Take care of Matt.

27:02.554 --> 27:04.991
You don't even have
 to ask me to say it.

27:05.024 --> 27:07.694
I already tried once
to keep him from comin'
to see you,

27:07.727 --> 27:09.796
but you know
how stubborn he is.

27:14.366 --> 27:15.768
I could tell him
 to stay away.

27:15.802 --> 27:17.970
That might be a good idea.

27:18.004 --> 27:19.305
I mean, for him.

27:22.675 --> 27:25.611
Will I see you again?

27:25.644 --> 27:27.646
It would be better for me
 if I said goodbye now.

27:28.981 --> 27:30.016
Okay.

27:35.387 --> 27:36.255
I'm sorry,

27:39.425 --> 27:40.727
but I can't do that.

27:42.428 --> 27:43.730
Goodbye.

27:44.897 --> 27:46.498
Goodbye, Miss Armstrong.

28:02.014 --> 28:06.285
I love you, Matt.
 Know that.

28:08.687 --> 28:14.761
I wish that I could have
shown you off to my friends
and hear you say

28:14.794 --> 28:16.796
"dang" in front of my mom.

28:18.865 --> 28:22.769
I wish we could
 have grown old together
 and had a family,

28:25.471 --> 28:27.740
but I'm grateful
for what we had.

28:32.611 --> 28:34.313
Please take care
 of everyone.

28:35.982 --> 28:38.350
You're far more important

28:38.384 --> 28:39.886
to holding this place
 together than you know.

28:41.754 --> 28:44.891
Take care of Eli,

28:44.924 --> 28:46.658
because he's going
 to take care of you
 in his own way.

28:49.561 --> 28:50.830
And forgive Ronald.

28:53.465 --> 28:56.468
He did what he had to do,
and if it was going
to be anyone,

28:56.502 --> 28:58.004
I am glad it was him.

29:00.472 --> 29:01.507
Okay?

29:05.511 --> 29:06.345
I love you.

29:09.816 --> 29:13.419
WRAY: Just relax.
 Breathe deeply, slowly.

29:14.987 --> 29:17.089
You're on the planet now.
 Eden.

29:17.123 --> 29:17.990
Yes.

29:19.859 --> 29:22.461
What do you feel?

29:22.494 --> 29:26.132
There's a nip in the air.
 I can see my breath.

29:26.165 --> 29:27.599
It's morning.

29:27.633 --> 29:29.601
Yes, the sun is out.

29:29.635 --> 29:30.837
Tell me what you see.

29:34.040 --> 29:37.043
The lake outside camp.
 It's beautiful.

29:39.145 --> 29:39.946
Val is here.

29:42.681 --> 29:43.950
What is Val saying?

29:44.783 --> 29:46.785
She's just smiling.

29:49.822 --> 29:53.092
We spent the night together
under the stars.

29:53.125 --> 29:55.995
The others don't know.
 It's our secret.

29:57.063 --> 29:58.130
Where are the others now?

29:59.565 --> 30:00.166
Working.

30:03.069 --> 30:04.703
We're always working.

30:04.736 --> 30:08.507
CAINE: It's just
too late in the season.
It's a waste of time.

30:08.540 --> 30:11.543
Well, we need to try.

30:11.577 --> 30:14.146
And we will, okay?
 We'll try again
 in the spring.

30:14.180 --> 30:16.148
For now we should just
gather what we can.

30:16.182 --> 30:18.184
PETER: We've picked
 most of this area clean.

30:18.217 --> 30:20.486
CAINE: Well then,
 at least gather
 some firewood.

30:20.519 --> 30:22.788
All right?

30:22.821 --> 30:25.691
I mean, there's no way
 of knowing how long
 this winter will last.

30:25.724 --> 30:26.758
It's just getting
colder every night.

30:32.899 --> 30:33.732
He's afraid.

30:34.266 --> 30:35.734
Who is?

30:35.767 --> 30:38.170
Caine. Winter is coming.

30:39.872 --> 30:43.775
All right. It's another day.
 The afternoon.

30:45.077 --> 30:46.078
Yes.

30:46.112 --> 30:47.213
Where are you now?

30:47.246 --> 30:48.114
In the forest.

30:50.216 --> 30:51.884
Chopping trees for firewood.

30:51.918 --> 30:53.619
With Caine?
No.

30:55.221 --> 30:56.455
No.

30:57.556 --> 30:58.457
Val!

30:59.591 --> 31:01.060
No...
 Peter...

31:01.093 --> 31:02.661
Val! Val...

31:02.694 --> 31:03.729
Peter, what's happening?

31:03.762 --> 31:04.796
(GRUNTING)

31:07.766 --> 31:09.068
She died on the planet.

31:09.101 --> 31:10.202
Are you sure?

31:10.236 --> 31:11.837
I remember now.

31:11.870 --> 31:14.941
It was before winter came.
 I was falling a tree.

31:14.974 --> 31:16.909
I didn't see her coming.

31:16.943 --> 31:18.744
She couldn't
 get out of the way.

31:18.777 --> 31:21.547
I saw her die! Months ago!

31:21.580 --> 31:23.882
How is that...

31:23.916 --> 31:25.117
(GROANING)
 Peter!

31:26.652 --> 31:27.853
(GRUNTING)

31:27.886 --> 31:29.788
This is Wray!
 I have a medical emergency!

31:30.923 --> 31:31.958
JOHANSEN: Make a hole!

31:53.845 --> 31:57.716
This time the symptoms are
 consistent with dehydration
 and hypothermia.

31:57.749 --> 32:00.219
You said
 the hypnosis was working.
 He was starting to remember.

32:00.252 --> 32:03.122
Yeah, the last thing
 he remembered was
 Val died on the planet.

32:03.155 --> 32:05.091
Well, based on
 the condition of his body,

32:05.124 --> 32:07.059
I would say Peter died
 on the planet, too,

32:07.093 --> 32:08.827
from extreme exposure.

32:08.860 --> 32:11.930
But he said
 Val died months ago,
 before the winter.

32:11.964 --> 32:13.132
Months ago?

32:16.835 --> 32:17.869
What if
 they're dying again?

32:18.971 --> 32:19.838
In order?

32:23.609 --> 32:26.112
Lieutenant Scott,
 I need you to
 locate Dr. Caine

32:26.145 --> 32:28.080
and the other members
 of the shuttle

32:28.114 --> 32:29.815
and escort them
 to the infirmary now.

32:30.716 --> 32:32.084
(KNOCKING)

32:32.118 --> 32:33.552
Rachel,
open the door, please.

32:41.293 --> 32:42.828
Please help me.

32:44.230 --> 32:46.265
We're going to help you.

32:46.298 --> 32:48.300
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
 maybe you shouldn't
 touch her.

32:48.334 --> 32:49.701
I don't want to die.

32:49.735 --> 32:50.236
We're gonna get you
 to the infirmary.

32:55.041 --> 32:56.108
She was like this
 when we found her.

32:56.142 --> 32:57.176
Put her over here.

32:59.245 --> 33:01.613
Strip down and get
your ass into decon.
This could be anything.

33:01.647 --> 33:02.748
I told him.
 JOHANSEN: Go!

33:04.650 --> 33:06.718
(GASPING) Please help me.

33:19.231 --> 33:21.233
Hey.

33:21.267 --> 33:22.668
I want to know what
 the hell's going on.

33:23.369 --> 33:24.903
I swear I don't know.

33:24.936 --> 33:26.405
Well, you're going
 to sit down with Wray

33:26.438 --> 33:28.074
until you figure it out,
 or I swear to God...

33:28.107 --> 33:29.875
We are members of your crew.

33:29.908 --> 33:32.244
No, you're former members.
 You left by choice!

33:32.278 --> 33:34.380
And if what's
 happening to you people
 spreads to the rest of us,

33:34.413 --> 33:35.981
you're going
to be dropped off
on the next planet!

33:36.014 --> 33:37.049
Sir, it's not his fault.

33:37.083 --> 33:38.750
None of this
 would be happening

33:38.784 --> 33:39.985
if Caine had not
talked those people

33:40.018 --> 33:41.253
into staying
 on that planet.

33:41.287 --> 33:42.221
I wanted to stay, too.

33:42.254 --> 33:43.889
And that's what would have
 happened to you.

33:46.092 --> 33:48.927
Camile, this is Young.
 Dr. Caine is your
 next volunteer.

33:48.960 --> 33:50.229
Colonel...
 Go. Now.

34:02.741 --> 34:03.875
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

34:11.817 --> 34:12.818
Chloe?

34:16.322 --> 34:17.322
Chloe.

34:20.792 --> 34:23.129
I thought you should know
 what's goin' on with those
 folks from the shuttle...

34:23.161 --> 34:24.429
Go away, Matt.
 What?

34:24.463 --> 34:26.331
I said leave. Now.

34:31.770 --> 34:34.906
I'll come back later, then.
 All right?

34:46.752 --> 34:49.087
All right, everyone,
 we know we're fighting
 hypothermia here,

34:49.121 --> 34:50.121
so let's keep their
 core temperatures up.

34:52.090 --> 34:53.324
What do you see?

34:58.864 --> 34:59.965
Snow is falling.

35:08.307 --> 35:10.041
The shuttle is our
 only shelter now.

35:14.446 --> 35:15.481
It's so cold.

35:18.450 --> 35:21.287
We lost power days ago.

35:21.320 --> 35:24.490
Something vital is broken
 and none of us know
 how to fix it.

35:24.523 --> 35:26.858
It's airtight,
so we have to leave

35:26.892 --> 35:30.362
the door ajar
or we'll suffocate.

35:30.396 --> 35:34.833
We still have some food,
 and Peter has
 made some candles

35:35.467 --> 35:36.835
to keep us warm.

35:39.205 --> 35:40.739
They provide
 enough light to read

35:42.508 --> 35:44.075
and share our evening meal.

35:46.412 --> 35:47.846
Peter is still with you?

35:51.250 --> 35:52.751
In his heart,
 he's already left us.

35:55.487 --> 35:56.788
I try to tell him...

35:56.822 --> 35:57.856
It'll be all right, Peter.

36:00.326 --> 36:04.896
No, it won't be all right.
 Nothing will be all right.

36:04.930 --> 36:06.532
But by morning, he's gone.

36:13.839 --> 36:14.940
Okay. Um...

36:20.246 --> 36:21.880
It's the last night.

36:21.913 --> 36:26.318
The night before you woke up
 inside the shuttle
 and Destiny was there.

36:26.352 --> 36:29.154
Yes. I remember.

36:29.187 --> 36:30.088
Tell me what you see.

36:32.291 --> 36:34.092
It's very dark.

36:34.125 --> 36:35.927
There's no pain. Just...

36:35.961 --> 36:37.195
Just the cold.

36:37.229 --> 36:38.397
Who else is there with you?

36:38.430 --> 36:39.865
(GROANS)

36:41.066 --> 36:42.100
What?

36:42.133 --> 36:43.235
They're all dead. Frozen.

36:48.274 --> 36:49.140
I'm alone.

36:50.609 --> 36:51.577
What are you doing?

36:51.610 --> 36:53.412
CAINE: There's nowhere
 for me to go.

36:57.916 --> 36:59.551
Nothing to do now but pray.

37:05.324 --> 37:08.026
The next thing I remember
is waking up on the shuttle

37:08.059 --> 37:09.995
and seeing Destiny
out the window.

37:12.664 --> 37:13.999
Is that all?

37:16.167 --> 37:17.903
I wish I had more
 answers for you.

37:19.938 --> 37:22.974
Me, too.

37:23.008 --> 37:26.478
But you won't have
 to drop me off at
 the next planet, Colonel.

37:26.512 --> 37:29.381
I expect I'll be dead
 before you come back
 out of FTL.

37:29.415 --> 37:30.516
You don't know that.

37:31.650 --> 37:35.654
Yes, I do.

37:35.687 --> 37:41.026
Because now
 I remember something
 that no one ever should.

37:44.663 --> 37:46.097
I'm already dead.

37:48.099 --> 37:51.069
Eli, did you leave
 this in the shuttle?

37:51.102 --> 37:52.471
No. Why?

37:52.504 --> 37:53.605
Well, somebody did.

38:04.215 --> 38:05.451
They all died
 in their sleep.

38:07.285 --> 38:09.187
With symptoms of
 severe exposure?

38:09.220 --> 38:11.022
Yeah.

38:11.056 --> 38:14.360
But I'm guessing
 whatever the aliens did
 to bring you back,

38:14.393 --> 38:16.027
it was only temporary.

38:16.061 --> 38:17.496
You're all just
 reverting back

38:17.529 --> 38:19.531
to the state they probably
 found you in.

38:22.401 --> 38:25.571
I'm sorry. I did everything
 I could think of.

38:26.705 --> 38:28.006
It's not your fault.

38:33.311 --> 38:34.580
How much time
do I have left?

38:36.482 --> 38:39.284
Not much.

38:39.317 --> 38:41.620
May I be allowed
 to see the stars
 one last time?

38:41.653 --> 38:43.689
Yeah, of course. Go ahead.

38:47.393 --> 38:49.661
I would like very much
 not to be alone.

39:05.777 --> 39:08.380
Wow. I forgot how
 beautiful this view was.

39:10.215 --> 39:11.483
Maybe they were
 just giving you

39:11.517 --> 39:12.951
the chance to see it
 one more time,

39:14.219 --> 39:17.022
or to say goodbye
 to all of us.

39:19.458 --> 39:23.495
This isn't me.
 At least not the man
 I was.

39:23.529 --> 39:25.697
That's what Dr. Rush
 was trying to tell me
 in his own way.

39:26.698 --> 39:28.299
I just didn't believe him.

39:32.303 --> 39:34.239
This body's nothing
but a shadow,

39:37.142 --> 39:40.078
not reborn, but reanimated,

39:41.480 --> 39:43.515
and not by God,

39:43.549 --> 39:46.284
but by beings who can
 rebuild a man's body,

39:47.786 --> 39:49.054
but not his soul.

39:53.158 --> 39:55.461
Maybe that's what you
 and Colonel Young
 were sensing.

39:59.465 --> 40:00.666
I don't feel that way now.

40:05.170 --> 40:06.472
That's kind of you to say.

40:10.175 --> 40:15.481
But even though
 I have his thoughts
 and some of his memories,

40:15.514 --> 40:17.516
I'm not the Robert Caine
 that God made.

40:21.753 --> 40:23.689
After all of this,
 you still believe?

40:25.356 --> 40:26.625
That is faith, T.J.

40:28.627 --> 40:31.597
I believe that my soul
 has already moved on,

40:31.630 --> 40:35.767
and is looking down
even now marveling

40:35.801 --> 40:38.303
at how kind you are
 to comfort a shadow.

40:50.148 --> 40:53.852
You have to believe
 with all of your heart
 that your daughter

40:53.885 --> 40:55.487
is in a better place.

40:58.490 --> 41:01.392
The greatest gift
 that you can give her,

41:03.829 --> 41:09.300
and to all of us,
 is to live your life,

41:09.334 --> 41:14.472
to fulfill Destiny's mission
 and have faith in each other.

41:35.561 --> 41:38.730
CAINE: If anyone's
 listening, help us.

41:40.599 --> 41:44.402
Help us. Please.

41:46.538 --> 41:47.773
I don't want to die.

41:51.710 --> 41:52.711
Help us...

41:56.582 --> 41:57.583
Please...
