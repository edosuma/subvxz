00:38.960 --> 00:44.000
Dear reader,
I've a naughty little tale to tell,

00:44.080 --> 00:46.720
plucked from the pages of history.

00:46.800 --> 00:48.800
Tarted up, true,

00:48.880 --> 00:53.000
but guaranteed to stimulate the senses.

00:53.080 --> 00:55.680
The story of Mademoiselle Renard,

00:55.760 --> 00:59.720
a ravishing, young aristocrat
whose sexual proclivities...

00:59.800 --> 01:03.280
ran the gamut from winsome to bestial.

01:04.720 --> 01:08.720
Who doesn't dream of indulging
every spasm of lust,

01:08.800 --> 01:11.440
feeding each depraved hunger?

01:13.280 --> 01:15.280
Owing to her noble birth,

01:15.360 --> 01:19.800
Mademoiselle Renard was granted
full immunity to do just that -

01:19.880 --> 01:23.920
inflicting pain and pleasure
with equal zest.

01:24.000 --> 01:26.640
Until one day...

01:29.440 --> 01:32.440
Mademoiselle found herself
at the mercy of a man...

01:32.480 --> 01:36.080
every bit as perverse as she.

01:37.760 --> 01:40.880
A man whose skill in the art of pain...

01:40.960 --> 01:43.600
exceeded her own.

02:16.800 --> 02:21.080
How easily, dear reader,

02:21.160 --> 02:25.120
one changes from predator...

02:25.200 --> 02:27.920
to prey.

02:28.000 --> 02:32.440
And how swiftly pleasure is
taken from some...

02:32.520 --> 02:34.360
and given to others.

02:36.400 --> 02:39.200
There goes another one.

04:05.000 --> 04:09.480
Your linens, please.

04:14.040 --> 04:16.839
- Move yourself.
- We're going outside.

04:20.160 --> 04:22.600
Good morning.

04:22.680 --> 04:25.280
- I'm going outside.
- Go on.

04:25.400 --> 04:28.960
Stop doing that. Everybody up.

04:31.440 --> 04:34.240
Your linens, please.

04:37.240 --> 04:39.960
Psst.

04:40.000 --> 04:43.560
It's me.

04:52.640 --> 04:55.120
Careful.
The ink's still wet.

05:02.560 --> 05:04.240
Now, hurry.

05:15.680 --> 05:18.400
That you, Maddie ?

05:20.160 --> 05:23.960
Yes, Mother.
Here are the dirty ones for you.

05:25.920 --> 05:27.920
Just, uh-

05:28.000 --> 05:30.640
Just taking the bleached ones out to dry.

05:46.360 --> 05:48.840
Aren't you gonna give us a hand then ?

06:11.000 --> 06:13.000
Bouchon!

06:15.640 --> 06:17.960
Remember your manners.

06:41.720 --> 06:45.160
Here it is.
It's the last chapter.

06:45.240 --> 06:47.880
Monsieur Masse says he'd like another
manuscript quick as he please.

06:47.960 --> 06:52.080
- He can't print them fast enough.
- I'll pass the word on.

06:52.120 --> 06:54.960
I'll pay you another visit with
a share of the profits once it's sold.

06:55.000 --> 06:59.160
- I'll be waiting.
- Perhaps, one day, you'll tell me your name.

07:15.400 --> 07:17.400
All right, we're all clear.

07:22.280 --> 07:24.440
- Thank you.
- Marquis de Sade's Justine.

07:24.520 --> 07:27.960
Latest edition, straight
from the printer's. Justine.

07:28.040 --> 07:30.040
Marquis de Sade.
Justine.

07:30.120 --> 07:34.360
Our story concerns
a nymph named Justine,

07:34.440 --> 07:37.560
as pretty a maid as ever
entered the nunnery,

07:37.640 --> 07:40.880
- with a body so firm and ripe...
- Come on, boy.

07:40.920 --> 07:44.240
it seemed a shame
to commit it to God.

07:44.280 --> 07:49.040
One morning, the bishop placed
his hand upon her thigh.

07:49.080 --> 07:51.600
"Holy Father," cried she,

07:51.680 --> 07:57.040
"I've come to confess my sins,
not commit them anew."

07:57.080 --> 08:01.360
Heedless, the old priest
turned her over on his knee...

08:01.400 --> 08:04.560
and lifted her skirts
high above her hips,

08:04.600 --> 08:09.040
exposing the pink flesh
of her backside.

08:09.080 --> 08:12.400
There between the orbs
of her dimpled ass...

08:12.440 --> 08:15.120
lay a blushing rosebud...

08:15.160 --> 08:19.600
begging to be... plucked.

08:19.640 --> 08:22.760
Before Justine could wrestle
from his grasp,

08:22.840 --> 08:27.080
this most ungodly man
took a communion wafer,

08:27.160 --> 08:30.440
the body of our Lord,
Jesus Christ,

08:30.520 --> 08:34.440
and placed it on the girl's
twitching orifice.

08:34.520 --> 08:37.919
Must I, Your Majesty ?

08:40.200 --> 08:43.799
As he loosened his manhood
from beneath his robes,

08:43.880 --> 08:46.720
the bishop muttered
a Latin prayer...

08:46.760 --> 08:49.120
and then,
with a mighty thrust,

08:49.160 --> 08:53.720
drove it into her very entrails.

08:55.080 --> 08:58.680
The novel's lewd subject matter
and its overripe style...

08:58.760 --> 09:01.400
reveal it to be the work
of the Marquis de Sade.

09:01.480 --> 09:04.720
He composes his prose
from inside a madhouse.

09:04.800 --> 09:07.960
Enough !
Seize every copy !

09:08.040 --> 09:12.320
We'll torch them all on the palace
lawn in full public view !

09:14.880 --> 09:17.080
As for the author, shoot him.

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
A note of caution, Sire.

09:25.080 --> 09:29.280
We all remember what happened
to Robespierre, Danton.

09:29.320 --> 09:34.160
Put the marquis to death and history
might even regard you as a despot.

09:34.240 --> 09:36.080
But I am history.

09:36.160 --> 09:38.480
Of course, Your Majesty.

09:38.560 --> 09:42.680
Nevertheless,
cure the Marquis de Sade,

09:42.760 --> 09:44.760
succeed where countless...

09:44.840 --> 09:48.480
physicians and priests
have failed-

09:48.560 --> 09:51.000
No one can fault Napoleon...

09:51.080 --> 09:54.920
for bringing a man to his senses.

09:55.000 --> 09:56.920
Might I suggest...

09:56.960 --> 10:00.440
an appraisal at the asylum of Charenton

10:00.520 --> 10:03.160
and the rather notorious inmate
in her care?

10:03.240 --> 10:05.200
I have the perfect candidate
for the job,

10:05.280 --> 10:07.800
Dr. Royer-Collard,

10:07.880 --> 10:11.440
a distinguished alienist
who's a staunchly moral man...

10:11.520 --> 10:13.880
of impeccable character...

10:13.960 --> 10:16.600
and iron resolve.

10:24.680 --> 10:27.520
My colleagues have called me
old-fashioned.

10:27.560 --> 10:29.920
Even barbaric.

10:34.240 --> 10:38.000
But here at the Hotel Dieu, we favour
an aggressive course of treatment.

10:38.080 --> 10:39.920
Quite.

10:40.000 --> 10:44.200
I do not seek popularity or renown,
Monsieur Delbené. Mine is a higher mission.

10:46.240 --> 10:49.360
To take God's tiny blunders
and those He has forsaken...

10:49.440 --> 10:52.720
and condition them with
the same force, the same rigor...

10:52.800 --> 10:56.880
one would employ to train
a feral dog or a wild stallion.

10:56.960 --> 11:00.080
This may not be pretty,

11:00.160 --> 11:02.960
but it is mercy just the same.

11:03.040 --> 11:06.920
A few more months of this,
and he'll be fine.

11:07.000 --> 11:10.160
It is the emperor's hope...

11:10.240 --> 11:12.880
that you bring your expertise,
your proficiency...

11:12.960 --> 11:15.080
- to the asylum at Charenton.
- I'm much better now.

11:15.160 --> 11:19.280
Charenton ? The administrator there
is quite well-loved, isn't he ?

11:19.360 --> 11:22.640
He's young, an idealist.
You'll have to be politic.

11:22.720 --> 11:26.000
Do you know how
I define idealism ?

11:26.080 --> 11:28.400
Youth's final luxury.

11:43.920 --> 11:48.160
Not so hard. Don't force it.

11:48.240 --> 11:50.720
Let the quill guide you.

11:51.920 --> 11:53.920
Good.

11:54.000 --> 11:55.960
Slowly.

11:56.000 --> 11:58.720
We mustn't just copy the words.

11:58.800 --> 12:02.240
It's important that we know
what they mean.

12:02.320 --> 12:07.040
St. Augustine tells us that angels and
demons walk among us on the Earth...

12:07.120 --> 12:12.000
and that sometimes they jointly
inhabit the soul of a single man.

12:13.520 --> 12:15.640
Then how can we know...

12:15.720 --> 12:19.640
who is truly good and who is evil ?

12:19.720 --> 12:23.520
Well, we can't.

12:23.600 --> 12:27.520
All we can do is guard
against our own corruption.

12:34.240 --> 12:37.400
So you'll practice reading
tonight on your own for me ?

12:38.960 --> 12:43.800
And so the professor lifted
Colombe's skirt...

12:43.840 --> 12:45.880
high above her waist.

12:48.080 --> 12:52.280
"Let me be your tutor" said he,
"in the ways of love."

12:52.320 --> 12:56.600
With that, he slid her...
pantalettes down,

12:56.640 --> 12:59.320
down, down over her knees.

12:59.360 --> 13:01.760
And there, nestled between her legs,

13:01.840 --> 13:04.080
as pink as a tulip,

13:04.160 --> 13:06.040
as slick as an eel...

13:06.080 --> 13:08.520
We oughtn't to be reading
his nasty stories.

13:08.600 --> 13:12.080
No one's forcing you to listen.

13:13.280 --> 13:15.480
He gazed upon her Venus mound,

13:18.720 --> 13:22.840
her flaxen quim,
the winking eye of God.

13:25.280 --> 13:29.000
You've been in his quarters,
haven't you ?

13:30.840 --> 13:32.720
Once or twice.

13:32.800 --> 13:36.760
I hear he's got a whetstone and a chisel,
that he uses to sharpen his teeth.

13:36.800 --> 13:39.160
He's a writer, not a madman.

13:39.200 --> 13:41.600
- What's he doing in here then ?
- Murder.

13:45.080 --> 13:47.680
That's not so.

13:50.200 --> 13:52.680
He writes books so wicked,
so black with evil,

13:52.760 --> 13:54.600
that one man killed his wife
after reading them.

13:54.680 --> 13:56.560
And two young mothers
miscarried their babies.

13:56.640 --> 13:59.720
I'd say that's murder enough.

13:59.800 --> 14:03.240
If you're going to slander him, you
don't deserve to hear his stories.

14:03.320 --> 14:06.920
I believe she's sweet on him.
That's what I think.

14:07.000 --> 14:11.320
It's not the marquis she's sweet on,
is it, Madeleine ?

14:36.560 --> 14:40.160
They've no right sending someone
to sit on your shoulder.

14:40.720 --> 14:44.000
I work for you.
I won't take orders from a stranger.

14:44.040 --> 14:46.200
You needn't worry.

14:46.280 --> 14:49.400
It's administrative,
nothing more.

14:51.080 --> 14:53.720
Please don't eat
the paint, Pasqual.

14:53.760 --> 14:56.640
Ah, bravo, Dauphin.

14:56.680 --> 15:00.280
It's far better to paint fires
than to set them, isn't it ?

15:00.360 --> 15:02.240
Yes.

15:02.280 --> 15:04.160
Wonderful.

15:06.040 --> 15:18.200
Fresh linens.

15:22.560 --> 15:24.880
I'm hungry for a proper visit.

15:24.920 --> 15:27.880
- Don't start.
- Go ahead. You've a key.

15:27.960 --> 15:31.280
Slip it through my tiny hole.

15:55.880 --> 15:57.800
Marquis ?

16:11.960 --> 16:14.960
Where did you get to then ?

17:21.760 --> 17:23.599
Marquis ?

17:29.440 --> 17:32.560
Well? Did I frighten you ?

17:32.600 --> 17:38.160
Frighten me ? That's a good one.
I'm twice as quick as you are.

17:38.200 --> 17:41.160
I suppose you want to know
about that silly book of yours.

17:41.240 --> 17:43.440
What about my book ?

17:44.800 --> 17:47.760
It sold like the devil.

17:47.840 --> 17:50.960
Then they started burning it.

17:51.040 --> 17:55.280
That's the peril of composing
such incendiary prose.

17:57.360 --> 18:02.560
If only these coins purchased
your other talents too.

18:02.640 --> 18:05.280
There's something else
I want from you.

18:05.360 --> 18:08.720
You've already stolen my heart...

18:08.800 --> 18:13.840
as well as another prominent organ
south of the equator.

18:13.880 --> 18:17.200
Your publisher says I'm not to leave
without another manuscript.

18:17.280 --> 18:19.440
I've just the story.

18:22.640 --> 18:25.760
Inspired by these very surroundings.

18:31.600 --> 18:36.840
The unhappy tale
of a virginal laundry lass,

18:36.920 --> 18:40.040
a darling of the lower wards where
they entomb the criminally insane.

18:40.080 --> 18:42.280
- Is it awfully violent ?
- Most assuredly.

18:42.320 --> 18:45.200
- Is it terribly erotic ?
- Fiendishly so.

18:45.280 --> 18:49.120
But it comes with a price.

18:49.200 --> 18:51.920
A kiss for each page.

18:53.680 --> 18:56.520
Must I administer them directly
or might I blow them ?

18:56.560 --> 19:01.520
The price, my coquette,
is every bit as firm... as I am.

19:01.600 --> 19:04.080
Oh, you.

19:04.160 --> 19:06.960
You talk the same as you write.

19:35.000 --> 19:37.000
Hello.

19:48.880 --> 19:50.720
So what are we today, Cleante ?

19:50.800 --> 19:53.120
Is it bullfinch or nightingale ?

19:53.200 --> 19:57.640
- There's but one kind of bird
in a madhouse, Abbé.
- Oh, don't tell me.

19:57.680 --> 19:59.560
A loon !

19:59.600 --> 20:03.360
Sorry, I've heard that one before.

20:06.680 --> 20:10.120
It's a long story, this one.

20:10.160 --> 20:13.080
The climax comes at a higher cost.

20:13.160 --> 20:15.160
You must sit on my lap.

20:15.240 --> 20:18.960
You demand a lot from your readers.

20:19.000 --> 20:23.000
The story's thrilling conclusion
comes at a premium.

20:23.080 --> 20:25.080
- What's that then ?
- Your maidenhead.

20:25.160 --> 20:27.960
And then you must sew it up
as tightly as the day you were born,

20:28.040 --> 20:32.320
and come back to me renewed
so I can deflower you a second time.

20:32.400 --> 20:34.520
Some things belong on paper...

20:34.600 --> 20:36.600
others in life.

20:36.680 --> 20:39.160
Blessed fool who can't tell
the difference-

20:41.000 --> 20:43.840
Mademoiselle LeClerc.

20:43.920 --> 20:47.800
You're in the nick of time.

20:47.880 --> 20:50.360
This old letch forgot himself.

20:50.440 --> 20:52.920
He thought I was a character
in one of his nasty stories.

20:53.000 --> 20:56.440
- Madeleine.
- Yes, Abbé ?

20:56.520 --> 20:59.760
The next time you feel
the urge to visit the marquis...

20:59.840 --> 21:02.960
I hope you'll come
to confession instead.

21:03.040 --> 21:06.040
Care for a splash
of wine, Abbé ?

21:09.400 --> 21:11.400
It's not even noon.

21:11.480 --> 21:14.640
Conversation, like certain portions
of the anatomy,

21:14.680 --> 21:16.600
always runs more smoothly
when it's lubricated.

21:18.040 --> 21:22.920
This is a rare vintage from
an obscure village in Bordeaux.

21:23.000 --> 21:27.880
Rather than crush the grape underfoot,
they place it on the belly of a bride,

21:27.960 --> 21:32.640
and reap its juices when the young
husband steers his vessel into port.

21:34.200 --> 21:38.400
Full-bodied flavor,
just a hint of wantonness.

21:41.880 --> 21:43.760
Bottoms up.

21:52.600 --> 21:56.840
It's from our own cellar.
I recognize the taste.

21:56.880 --> 22:00.560
I should have told you
it was the blood of Christ.

22:00.600 --> 22:03.440
You'd believe that, wouldn't you ?

22:06.640 --> 22:10.560
We treat you well enough here,
don't we, Marquis ?

22:10.640 --> 22:13.640
Your very own feathered bed
in lieu of a straw mat.

22:13.680 --> 22:16.320
Your antique writing desk,
all the way from La Coste.

22:16.400 --> 22:18.240
Enough quills to feather an ostrich-

22:18.320 --> 22:21.200
Yes, yes, yes, dear heart, it's true.
You spoil me pink.

22:21.280 --> 22:25.440
And in exchange, we ask only
that you follow the rules.

22:25.520 --> 22:28.320
You know as well as I do, you're not
to entertain visitors in your quarters.

22:28.400 --> 22:30.240
I'm entertaining you now, aren't I ?

22:30.320 --> 22:34.320
Yes, but I'm not a beautiful,
young prospect ripe for corruption.

22:34.400 --> 22:36.320
Don't be so sure.

22:41.840 --> 22:45.240
Take your pen in hand, Marquis.

22:45.320 --> 22:48.440
Purge these wicked thoughts
of yours on paper.

22:48.520 --> 22:51.520
Maybe they'll govern you less in life.

22:51.600 --> 22:55.320
I'll fill page after page,
my cherub.

22:55.400 --> 22:58.040
I promise.

23:11.800 --> 23:14.720
We're here, Doctor.
Mind your step, sir.

23:17.080 --> 23:20.360
Good day, sir.
We've been expecting you.

24:21.160 --> 24:23.360
Good. Very good.

24:25.320 --> 24:28.360
Dr. Royer-Collard,
welcome to Charenton.

24:28.440 --> 24:32.000
This may feel a little awkward, my friend,

24:32.040 --> 24:34.080
but it needn't be.

24:34.120 --> 24:37.960
I've come merely to oversee your
work here. Understood ?

24:38.040 --> 24:41.120
- Of course.
- It's a formality. Truly.

24:41.200 --> 24:45.280
Well, you're a man of science,
and I'm a man of God.

24:45.320 --> 24:48.200
Charenton stands to profit
from us both, I'm certain.

24:48.240 --> 24:52.000
I shall need an office on the grounds,
somewhere to store my things.

24:52.040 --> 24:54.120
- This way.
- If you don't mind my asking,

24:54.200 --> 24:58.080
why has the emperor taken
such sudden interest in my-

24:58.160 --> 25:01.040
in our affairs ?

25:01.120 --> 25:06.640
It seems a particular patient of
yours... has captured his fancy.

25:10.720 --> 25:14.960
I understand he practices the very
crimes he preaches in his fiction.

25:15.040 --> 25:16.880
Certainly not here.

25:16.960 --> 25:20.760
- There were a few indiscretions in his youth.
- Indiscretions ?

25:20.840 --> 25:23.600
Abbé, please,
I have read his case history.

25:23.680 --> 25:27.040
At 16, he violated
a servant girl with a crucifix.

25:27.080 --> 25:30.440
After six months in a dungeon,
he mutilated a prostitute,

25:30.520 --> 25:35.320
carving her flesh with a razor and
cauterizing the wounds with hot wax.

25:35.400 --> 25:37.280
I hope you'll judge him
by his progress here,

25:37.360 --> 25:39.280
- No !
- not his past reputation.

25:39.360 --> 25:43.280
I can't go on like this.
Why should this be happening to me ?

25:43.360 --> 25:45.680
Once again, gentlemen.

25:45.760 --> 25:48.240
I'm just a lowly cobbler.

25:48.320 --> 25:50.640
I have been all my life.

25:50.720 --> 25:55.400
And with this shoe,
I'm asking you to be a cobbler's wife.

25:55.440 --> 26:00.680
It's a dreadful play, a festering pustule
on the face of literature.

26:00.720 --> 26:03.680
Why, the parchment it's written upon
isn't worthy to wipe my ass.

26:06.200 --> 26:10.720
But you need not make it worse.
Say your lines with conviction,
my happy little shoemaker.

26:10.800 --> 26:14.720
- Like a true actor.
- But I'm not an actor. I'm a dyspeptic.

26:14.800 --> 26:17.560
Just seduce her, you goon !

26:17.640 --> 26:20.360
He's actually made a great success
of our little theater.

26:20.400 --> 26:24.680
There's seldom an empty seat,
not to mention its therapeutic value.

26:24.720 --> 26:26.600
Playing dress-up with cretins...

26:26.640 --> 26:29.480
sounds like a symptom
of madness, not a cure.

26:29.520 --> 26:32.640
Homo perversio:
a species that thrives in captivity.

26:32.720 --> 26:35.680
Marquis, this is Dr. Royer-Collard.
He's joining us here in-

26:35.760 --> 26:38.280
An advisory capacity.

26:38.360 --> 26:40.960
Welcome to our humble madhouse, Doctor.

26:41.040 --> 26:44.120
I trust you'll find yourself at home.

26:44.200 --> 26:46.440
There he is, the new doctor.

26:46.480 --> 26:50.280
Tell me, Abbé, why is he in your care
and not a proper prison ?

26:50.320 --> 26:53.240
- His wife's influence.
- "His wife's" ?

26:53.320 --> 26:57.000
Better to have an insane spouse
than a criminal one.

26:57.080 --> 27:00.120
And he has never once
tried to escape ?

27:00.200 --> 27:04.440
A man of his notoriety? He wouldn't last
a day on the streets without capture.

27:04.520 --> 27:08.440
Besides, every wholesome thing
he might desire, he has at Charenton,

27:08.520 --> 27:11.000
a library filled with the world's
great books,

27:11.080 --> 27:13.680
music lessons, watercolor exercises.

27:13.760 --> 27:17.080
What effect have all these amenities
had on his psyche ?

27:17.160 --> 27:19.560
He no longer roars or spits.

27:19.640 --> 27:23.080
He no longer taunts the guards
or molests his fellow wards.

27:23.160 --> 27:25.720
And his writing ?

27:25.800 --> 27:27.960
- Ah, yes, that.
- Well ?

27:28.040 --> 27:32.120
It's essential to his recovery,
a purgative for the toxins in his mind.

27:32.240 --> 27:34.680
Do you favor its publication ?

27:34.760 --> 27:37.560
- For sale ? To the general public ?
- Yes. Yes.

27:37.640 --> 27:40.040
No, certainly not. It's unprintable.

27:56.120 --> 28:00.160
All France is aghast at this book,
yet you've never heard of it.

28:00.240 --> 28:02.120
Oh, dear God.

28:03.800 --> 28:08.520
Silence the marquis, or Charenton will
be shut down by order of the emperor.

28:08.560 --> 28:12.080
Shut down ? But he's one
among some 200 wards.

28:12.160 --> 28:14.560
You could try my calming chair on him.

28:14.640 --> 28:17.000
Or, perhaps,
try bleeding him with leeches.

28:17.080 --> 28:19.880
Or maybe flog him at the stake.

28:19.920 --> 28:22.440
Why ? So he'll learn
to fear punishment...

28:22.520 --> 28:25.640
rather than to see virtue
for its own rewards ?

28:25.720 --> 28:29.600
Doctor, let me take up this matter
with the marquis myself.

28:29.640 --> 28:32.600
- Chariton's my life's work.
- I am not without a heart.

28:32.680 --> 28:37.320
But this book is a profound insult
to decent people everywhere.

28:37.400 --> 28:40.200
Can you personally guarantee
this won't happen again ?

28:40.240 --> 28:42.640
You have my word.

28:52.320 --> 28:56.360
- What is it, Abbé ?
- The marquis has embarrassed us.

28:56.440 --> 28:59.880
- From Napoleon himself.
- Why ? What's he done ?

28:59.960 --> 29:02.760
He's been slipping manuscripts
to a publisher.

29:02.840 --> 29:05.800
- He has ?

29:07.000 --> 29:09.480
I placed my trust
too carelessly, Madeleine.

29:18.560 --> 29:21.960
- This is a complete and utter...
- Oh.

29:22.040 --> 29:24.080
disappointment.

29:24.160 --> 29:26.040
Yes, it is.

29:26.120 --> 29:28.040
The paper's cheap.
The type's too small.

29:28.120 --> 29:31.400
What did you do,
bribe one of the guards ?

29:31.440 --> 29:35.520
But you implored me to write
for curative purposes,
to stave off my madness.

29:35.600 --> 29:37.960
But you've no right
to publish...

29:38.000 --> 29:40.360
behind my back
without my sanction.

29:40.440 --> 29:44.160
Have you truly read it,
or did you run straightaway
to the dog-eared pages ?

29:44.200 --> 29:47.200
Oh, enough to discern
its tenor.

29:47.240 --> 29:49.280
And ?

29:50.760 --> 29:53.040
It's not even a proper novel.

29:53.120 --> 29:56.640
It's nothing but an encyclopedia
of perversions.

29:56.720 --> 29:59.160
Frankly, it even fails
as an exercise in craft.

29:59.240 --> 30:02.360
Characters are wooden.
The dialogue is inane.

30:02.440 --> 30:07.520
Not to mention the endless repetition
of words like "nipple" and "pikestaff."

30:07.560 --> 30:09.440
There I was taxed,
it's true.

30:09.480 --> 30:11.680
And such puny scope.

30:11.720 --> 30:13.880
Nothing but the very worst
in man's nature.

30:13.960 --> 30:16.320
I write of the great
eternal truths...

30:16.360 --> 30:19.840
that bind together all mankind
the whole world over.

30:19.880 --> 30:23.360
We eat, we shit, we fuck,
we kill and we die.

30:23.400 --> 30:25.280
But we also fall in love.

30:25.320 --> 30:28.320
We build cities,
we compose symphonies
and we endure.

30:28.360 --> 30:30.280
Why not put that
in your books as well ?

30:30.360 --> 30:33.280
It's a fiction,
not a moral treatise.

30:33.360 --> 30:36.320
But isn't the duty of art
to elevate us above the beasts ?

30:36.400 --> 30:39.560
I'd have thought that was
your duty, Abbé, not mine.

30:39.640 --> 30:42.720
One more trick like this...

30:42.800 --> 30:45.200
and I'll be forced
to revoke all your liberties.

30:47.000 --> 30:50.320
It's that doctor fellow,
isn't it ?

30:50.400 --> 30:53.520
He's come to usurp
your place here, hasn't he ?

30:53.600 --> 30:57.320
Marquis, more than
your writing's at stake.

30:57.400 --> 30:59.240
The ministry has threatened us
with closure.

30:59.320 --> 31:02.080
Ah, they can't be serious !

31:02.120 --> 31:04.520
Our future lies
in the stroke of your pen.

31:04.600 --> 31:07.000
Mightier than the sword,
indeed.

31:07.080 --> 31:09.880
Put yourself in my place. I have
your fellow patients to consider.

31:09.960 --> 31:14.400
If Charenton folds, they have
no place to go, no manner
to clothe or feed themselves.

31:14.440 --> 31:18.640
Fuck them ! They're half-wits !
Let them die on the streets
as nature intended !

31:18.720 --> 31:21.200
You among them ?

31:24.440 --> 31:28.280
If ever I showed you
a kind hand, Marquis,

31:28.360 --> 31:30.440
if ever I granted you
walking privileges
on a spring day...

31:30.520 --> 31:32.840
or slipped an extra pillow
beneath your door,

31:32.920 --> 31:38.160
if ever I shared your wine,
laughed at your vulgarities
or humored you with argument,

31:38.240 --> 31:40.520
then you will oblige me now...

31:40.600 --> 31:43.600
for your sake...
and for all Charenton.

31:43.680 --> 31:46.720
You've a touch
of the poet too.

31:46.760 --> 31:48.640
Perhaps you should
take up the quill.

31:48.680 --> 31:54.240
- Do I have your word ?
- Honestly, you cut me to the core.

31:54.280 --> 31:56.800
What's the point of all your
valiant attempts at rehabilitation...

31:56.840 --> 32:00.960
if, when I finally succumb,
when at long last I pledge
myself to righteous conduct,

32:01.000 --> 32:05.560
you regard me
with nothing but suspicion ?

32:05.640 --> 32:09.440
Have you no faith
in your own medicine ?

32:13.320 --> 32:15.360
My, my.

32:16.960 --> 32:20.800
At Charenton,
even the walls have eyes.

32:20.840 --> 32:22.720
Don't they ?

32:27.960 --> 32:29.840
Well ?

32:29.920 --> 32:33.320
Well, I spoke to him
with reason and compassion,

32:33.400 --> 32:35.360
the tools which
serve us best here.

32:35.400 --> 32:38.280
- And ?
- He's sworn to obedience.

32:38.360 --> 32:42.040
He's more than a patient, Doctor.
The marquis is my friend.

32:42.120 --> 32:44.400
You keep strange
company, Abbé.

32:44.480 --> 32:46.800
If you have the matter here
truly in hand,

32:46.880 --> 32:50.320
- I have.
- then I have a friend
of my own to visit.

32:55.840 --> 32:58.600
- Ah, Doctor.
- I've come for my bride.

32:58.680 --> 33:02.080
- Oh, yes.

33:02.160 --> 33:04.560
We've not expected you
for some time.

33:04.640 --> 33:07.280
Simone has not yet
come of age.

33:07.360 --> 33:09.360
I've taken a new post
at Charenton.

33:09.440 --> 33:13.160
- I need the succor
only a wife can provide.
- Mmm, yes.

33:15.360 --> 33:18.560
Simone...

33:18.600 --> 33:21.800
you remember Dr. Royer-Collard.

33:21.840 --> 33:24.000
I'd not forget the man
to whom I was promised.

33:24.040 --> 33:26.560
He's come to collect you.

33:26.640 --> 33:30.280
Today ? This minute ?

33:33.120 --> 33:35.520
I apologize, mademoiselle.

33:35.600 --> 33:38.440
I had no time to write.

33:49.320 --> 33:51.600
Be grateful, child.

33:51.680 --> 33:55.200
In my experience, poor girls
who are orphaned never wed.

33:55.240 --> 33:58.880
They wind up spinsters
or, worse still, nuns.

33:58.920 --> 34:01.440
- Thank God that fortune
has spared you...

34:01.520 --> 34:03.520
from such a fate.

34:06.480 --> 34:08.639
Good-bye, Simone.

34:08.679 --> 34:10.280
God bless you, Simone.

34:17.840 --> 34:19.400
Let's move it !

35:05.640 --> 35:09.640
The emperor wishes to assure
your comfort while at Charenton.

35:09.720 --> 35:11.960
Consider the chateau a gift,

35:12.040 --> 35:15.840
provided you're willing
to finance the necessary repairs.

35:18.120 --> 35:23.360
Monsieur Prouix is the court's
most promising young architect.

35:23.400 --> 35:25.400
He's at your disposal.

35:35.800 --> 35:38.840
Of course, the place hasn't been
occupied since the Terror.

35:38.920 --> 35:42.920
It has possibilities, yes ?

35:43.000 --> 35:45.000
Simone ?

35:45.080 --> 35:48.360
I am to live here ?

35:48.440 --> 35:51.760
It belonged to the Duke du Blangie,
a avowed monarchist.

35:51.840 --> 35:55.080
The Jacobins were most unforgiving.

35:55.160 --> 35:57.800
His wife tried to escape.

35:59.080 --> 36:01.960
They caught her here on the stairs.

36:02.040 --> 36:05.480
Set about her with bayonets.

36:05.560 --> 36:09.440
There but for the grace
of God, eh, Doctor ?

36:09.520 --> 36:14.080
I shed no tears for the past,
Mr Delbené. I look to the future.

36:14.120 --> 36:16.520
Monsieur Prouix.

36:18.040 --> 36:22.120
We should quarry fresh marble,
don't you think ?

36:22.200 --> 36:24.360
You must humor my wife
in all things.

36:24.440 --> 36:26.600
If she wants Venetian glass,
she shall have it.

36:26.680 --> 36:30.280
Italian tile, Dutch velvet-
Spare no expense.

36:30.360 --> 36:35.680
But in her bedroom, see to it that
the door locks from the outside...

36:35.720 --> 36:38.560
and on her windows are iron grates.

36:38.600 --> 36:40.480
Bars, sir ?

36:40.520 --> 36:44.560
In the convent, Simone was spared
the world's temptations.

36:44.640 --> 36:48.000
I will not allow her
to fall prey to them now.

36:48.040 --> 36:50.240
She is a rare bird.

36:50.280 --> 36:53.480
I intend to keep her caged.

37:38.520 --> 37:40.400
Perhaps the sisters...

37:40.440 --> 37:44.080
failed to instruct you...

37:44.120 --> 37:47.440
in the ways of marriage.

37:47.480 --> 37:50.480
The nightly duty...

37:50.560 --> 37:55.920
of a wife... to her husband.

38:14.200 --> 38:16.920
- No.
- It's a scandal, truly.

38:17.000 --> 38:19.600
He's a doctor pretending
to be a God-fearing man.

38:19.640 --> 38:23.280
And that's not all. He's far too old
to marry her, and she's far too young.

38:23.320 --> 38:26.360
- Hasn't finished her schooling.
- Whisked away with barely a word.

38:26.440 --> 38:29.520
- And that's not all.
- Tell me more.

38:29.560 --> 38:32.720
The sweet little thing is barely 16.

38:32.760 --> 38:37.400
I say she's even younger,
only a child.

38:37.480 --> 38:39.920
- That's not all the nuns told us.
- Tell me more.

38:39.960 --> 38:42.120
Listen to this.

38:42.200 --> 38:45.480
No.

38:48.720 --> 38:50.960
- And that's not all.
- What else ?

38:51.000 --> 38:53.840
She's not a coquette.
She's meant to be a nun.

38:53.880 --> 38:55.760
I swear.

38:55.800 --> 39:00.040
- Tell me more.
- She came with a statue of the Virgin Mary.

39:04.880 --> 39:09.360
She arrived with a statue of the
Virgin Mary and a crucifix around
her neck from a convent.

39:09.440 --> 39:11.760
Hmm. Tell me more.

39:11.800 --> 39:14.560
He's old enough to have
fathered her twice over.

39:14.640 --> 39:16.560
The hypocrite.

39:16.600 --> 39:19.920
This has all the makings of a farce.

39:35.280 --> 39:37.600
Abbé de Coulmier, you rascal.

39:37.680 --> 39:40.640
Your comedies are becoming quite the
rage. I had to claw my way to a ticket.

39:40.720 --> 39:42.560
- I can hardly take-
- So expertly acted.

39:42.640 --> 39:44.960
That charming young man
in last week's comedy-

39:45.040 --> 39:47.320
I had no idea he was an imbecile.

39:47.400 --> 39:49.240
Everyone has talents
if we look for them.

39:49.320 --> 39:51.160
- Yes, yes, I'm sure.
- Oh.

39:51.240 --> 39:53.760
Isn't that the new doctor?
How thrilling for you.

39:53.840 --> 39:57.440
- A renowned expert
right here at Charenton.
- Yes, indeed.

39:57.520 --> 40:01.280
I will say one thing for him.
He has a beautiful daughter.

40:18.560 --> 40:20.480
Enough of this bilge!

40:20.560 --> 40:23.000
We're better than this.

40:25.680 --> 40:29.400
Remember, gentlemen,
inside each of your... delicate minds,

40:29.440 --> 40:32.240
your distinctive bodies,

40:32.280 --> 40:35.280
art is waiting to be born !

40:35.360 --> 40:41.040
So let's give the doctor a performance
tonight I hope he'll remember forever.

41:05.880 --> 41:09.080
That's Madame Bouginal
and Mademoiselle Clairel.

41:09.120 --> 41:11.120
And in front of them,
the marquis' wife.

41:12.160 --> 41:13.480
Indeed.

41:21.240 --> 41:23.240
Begging your pardon,
it's time to begin.

41:28.200 --> 41:31.240
You ! You're the north wind.

41:31.320 --> 41:34.040
Mesdames et Messieurs,

41:34.120 --> 41:38.480
there's been a change
in tonight's program.

41:38.520 --> 41:42.040
We will not be performing
The Happy Shoemaker.

41:42.120 --> 41:44.080
Instead,

41:44.160 --> 41:47.280
we'd like to premiere a new play...

41:47.360 --> 41:50.840
in honor of the newly appointed
Dr. Royer-Collard...

41:50.920 --> 41:53.400
and his lovely bride.

41:53.480 --> 41:56.320
A comedy entitled-

41:59.000 --> 42:02.520
- Crimes of Love.
- The Crimes of Love.

42:02.600 --> 42:06.400
Written by one of Charenton's
very own wards,

42:06.480 --> 42:10.360
the Marquis de Sade !

42:41.000 --> 42:44.520
- Wait. Statue, statue.
- There you are.

42:55.040 --> 42:57.240
Sister Senfone,
whither do we go,

42:57.320 --> 43:00.120
passing over rivers,
canyons and snow ?

43:00.200 --> 43:03.160
Hurry Eugenie,
for we must not tarry.

43:03.240 --> 43:06.560
I deliver you now
to the man you shall marry.

43:08.440 --> 43:10.320
When you have rested,
at your leisure,

43:10.360 --> 43:12.800
he will coach you
in the ways of pleasure.

43:16.440 --> 43:22.000
At last, she arrives,
my hard-won bride.

43:26.040 --> 43:28.000
Hurry, my child,
and scurry inside.

43:28.080 --> 43:32.080
There you'll find
such treasures await you.

43:32.120 --> 43:36.080
Marzipan and meringue
to sate you.

43:36.120 --> 43:39.280
Such gallantry in men
is sadly a rarity.

43:39.320 --> 43:42.440
How lucky I am
to receive his charity.

43:45.440 --> 43:48.000
Thank you, dear sister,
for abetting me so,

43:48.080 --> 43:50.640
- bringing her here
to this secluded chateau.
- Quickly.

43:50.680 --> 43:54.000
- Stand still and be quiet.
- Was that good ?

43:54.040 --> 43:58.080
Little does she know
that terror's in store...

43:58.160 --> 44:02.640
when I tutor her in
Les crimes...

44:02.720 --> 44:04.480
de l'amour.

44:10.840 --> 44:14.200
Take this side of the curtain.
One, two, three-

44:38.400 --> 44:42.200
Quickly, my suckling,
out of your clothes.

44:42.280 --> 44:45.040
My scepter awaits.
How solid it grows.

44:45.120 --> 44:47.960
Stop it, I beg you.
Have pity I say.

44:48.040 --> 44:50.720
You're not my lover.
You're a monstrous roué.

44:50.760 --> 44:54.840
Do as you're told.

44:54.880 --> 44:58.000
- Stick your legs in the air.
- Leave at once.

44:58.080 --> 45:00.280
- But it's just begun.
- Do as I say.

45:00.320 --> 45:02.560
Madame.

45:04.640 --> 45:06.960
It's true, I'm a pig.

45:10.080 --> 45:12.440
And you've truffles down there.

45:14.720 --> 45:16.720
Oh, God !
Oh, God, what's this ?

45:16.800 --> 45:18.640
Such a wicked sensation.

45:18.720 --> 45:21.520
A feeling somewhere
between shame and elation.

45:21.600 --> 45:24.080
Oh, God !

45:24.160 --> 45:28.920
Use your tongue like a wand in much
the same manner as Sister Semfone.

45:28.960 --> 45:32.560
Leaving already ?
Of course, you've seen it all before.

45:34.600 --> 45:38.520
I had a suspicion
the sister was sapphic.

45:38.600 --> 45:40.560
I'd tell you more,
but it's simply too graphic.

45:40.640 --> 45:42.800
Suffice it to say
she's a preference for lasses.

45:42.880 --> 45:45.560
Even at Vespers,
she always made passes.

45:47.000 --> 45:52.440
My darling Eugenie, dainty morsel,
get on your back. Let's try it dorsal !

45:54.680 --> 45:57.840
I won't escape. He wants to take me
in every way.

45:57.920 --> 46:01.680
I'll plunder every lovely pore
till you're weak and cry "No more!"

46:01.760 --> 46:03.840
No, more, more !

46:03.920 --> 46:07.160
Give me this !
More ! More !

46:07.200 --> 46:10.840
Everybody, come forward quietly
for the next bit.

46:10.880 --> 46:13.560
Then to prove you're truly mine,
I'll plunder you, darling,
from behind !

46:13.600 --> 46:16.200
Yes, yes, yes,
let's do it.

46:16.280 --> 46:20.120
And what of my lips ?
Will you soil them too ?

46:20.160 --> 46:21.800
When you've broken
every other taboo ?

46:22.880 --> 46:25.440
I'll fill every slippery hollow.

46:25.480 --> 46:29.880
If you're obliging,
then you'll swallow!

46:43.600 --> 46:46.520
Manners !

46:49.280 --> 46:51.400
- Now that my body is broken and swollen,
- Yes !

47:12.920 --> 47:16.040
Take him to the infirmary.
Maddie ?

47:17.720 --> 47:22.240
- Has he hurt you ?
- No. His breath made my eyes run,
that's all.

47:22.880 --> 47:24.720
It's all right.

47:24.800 --> 47:27.200
Madeleine ?

47:27.280 --> 47:30.720
Do you mean to take us
all down with you ?

47:30.960 --> 47:33.400
Don't be absurd.

47:33.480 --> 47:35.800
Disgraceful!

47:35.840 --> 47:37.840
It's only a play.

47:45.560 --> 47:48.080
That play was filthy.

47:49.080 --> 47:51.600
It's disgusting.

48:00.320 --> 48:04.920
I wonder who's to blame,
the author or his muse ?

48:08.000 --> 48:09.880
- It was fiction, of course.
- Of course.

48:09.920 --> 48:12.440
- It was not inspired by circumstance.
- It certainly was not.

48:12.480 --> 48:14.360
You ought to be ashamed, Abbé,

48:14.400 --> 48:17.880
exploiting these pathetic cretins
for financial gain.

48:17.920 --> 48:19.800
This is not our intention.

48:19.840 --> 48:22.280
It was a freak show for tourists
and curiosity seekers.

48:22.360 --> 48:24.920
Charenton is a sanatorium,
not a circus !

48:24.960 --> 48:27.280
The theater is henceforth closed.

48:27.360 --> 48:29.360
Closed ?

48:29.440 --> 48:31.400
As for your friend,
playwright emeritus of the madhouse-

48:31.480 --> 48:34.040
I'll do everything in my power-

48:34.080 --> 48:37.080
Do more, or I shall be forced
to inform the ministry...

48:37.120 --> 48:40.120
that the inmates are,
indeed, running the asylum.

48:54.200 --> 48:56.360
Mmm. Mmm.

48:56.440 --> 49:00.840
Well, I hope you're satisfied.

49:00.920 --> 49:03.560
He shut down our theater.

49:03.640 --> 49:05.480
He can't do that to me.

49:05.560 --> 49:09.800
How can one man be so selfish ?

49:11.000 --> 49:12.840
We merely held up a mirror.

49:12.920 --> 49:14.880
Apparently,
he didn't like what he saw.

49:20.280 --> 49:24.120
- What the devil are you
doing with my quills ?
- You've left me no choice.

49:24.160 --> 49:27.080
I kept my promise. I didn't publish.

49:28.640 --> 49:31.280
Perhaps, in time,
you can earn them back.

49:31.360 --> 49:33.240
You can't.

49:33.320 --> 49:35.600
I've all the demons of hell in my head.

49:35.680 --> 49:38.040
My only salvation
is to vent them on paper.

49:38.120 --> 49:40.040
Try reading for a change.

49:40.120 --> 49:42.120
The writer who produces more
than he reads-

49:42.200 --> 49:45.440
A sure mark of an amateur.

49:45.520 --> 49:47.400
Here.

49:47.480 --> 49:49.320
Start with the Bible.

49:49.400 --> 49:53.160
It's cheerier and more artfully written.

49:53.240 --> 49:56.040
This monstrous God of yours ?

49:56.120 --> 49:58.640
He strung up His very own son
like a side of veal.

49:58.720 --> 50:02.040
I shudder to think what He'd do to me.

50:08.440 --> 50:11.040
Why are you doing this to me ?

50:11.120 --> 50:13.360
Stop it.

50:13.440 --> 50:15.960
I'll die of loneliness.

50:16.040 --> 50:18.600
I've no company but the characters I create.

50:18.680 --> 50:21.400
Whores and pederasts !

50:21.480 --> 50:23.360
You're better off without them.

50:24.760 --> 50:27.400
- I have a proposition.
- You always do.

50:27.480 --> 50:30.440
Madeleine. She's besotted with me.

50:30.520 --> 50:33.560
She'd do anything I asked.
She could pay you a midnight visit.

50:33.640 --> 50:37.560
I don't know who you insult more,
her or me.

50:37.640 --> 50:39.960
- Part the gates of heaven, as it were.
- That's enough !

50:40.040 --> 50:42.800
You're too tense, darling. You could
do with a long, slow screw.

50:44.160 --> 50:47.120
Good night, Marquis.

50:47.200 --> 50:52.040
Then bugger me !
Goddamn you, Abbé !

50:52.120 --> 50:54.440
Have you no true sense
of my condition ?

50:54.520 --> 50:56.360
Of its gravity ?

50:56.440 --> 51:00.040
My writing is involuntary,
like the beating of my heart.

51:00.120 --> 51:02.600
My constant erection !

51:12.600 --> 51:15.720
I've done just as you bade me.

51:15.800 --> 51:20.200
I've paid a visit to the craftsmen.

51:20.280 --> 51:22.560
He laughed and called me a whore.

51:22.640 --> 51:24.480
Took my money just the same.

51:26.080 --> 51:27.920
I don't know which
gives you greater pleasure:

51:28.000 --> 51:29.840
the objects themselves...

51:29.920 --> 51:34.760
or the humiliation I endure
procuring them on your behalf.

51:36.320 --> 51:38.160
And last, but not least,

51:38.240 --> 51:41.000
I brought you some aniseed drops...

51:41.080 --> 51:43.680
and some chocolate pastilles.

51:46.800 --> 51:49.040
Did you now, madame ?

51:51.560 --> 51:55.520
They're filled with cream, yes ?

51:57.240 --> 52:00.480
You know I shan't touch them
unless they're positively...

52:00.560 --> 52:03.200
bursting,

52:03.240 --> 52:06.560
erupting with cream.

52:08.800 --> 52:11.520
What else have you brought
that I might nibble upon ?

52:11.560 --> 52:14.080
- Donatien, you mustn't.
- Hmm ?

52:14.120 --> 52:17.440
Tell me. What other little treats ?

52:17.480 --> 52:20.040
Shame on you, truly.

52:20.120 --> 52:24.160
For fuck's sake, woman.
Bonbons ?

52:24.240 --> 52:26.680
Am I to sit here gorging myself
on useless trifles,

52:26.760 --> 52:28.640
sucking on your little sweetmeats,

52:28.680 --> 52:30.880
when what I truly require,
what I truly need...

52:30.920 --> 52:35.200
are a few quill pens,
perhaps a pot of ink ?

52:35.240 --> 52:38.560
- Forgive me. I beg you.
- Don't you see ?

52:38.600 --> 52:40.840
I've been raped.

52:40.920 --> 52:45.320
- Far more egregiously than any
of my wretched characters.
- How was I to know, darling ?

52:45.400 --> 52:48.400
How was I to tell you,
by writing a letter ?

52:48.480 --> 52:50.440
With what, my asinine bride ?

52:50.520 --> 52:52.520
I beg you, Donatien,

52:52.600 --> 52:56.200
as your wife, your only ally,
you must stop making a monstrous
spectacle of yourself!

52:56.280 --> 53:00.000
- You have come to lecture me ?
- To flaunt your deviance
in public upon a stage ?

53:00.080 --> 53:02.000
They have put you up to this,
haven't they ?

53:02.080 --> 53:04.040
You should court the doctor's favor,
not his contempt.

53:04.120 --> 53:08.480
The doctor ? I ought to
carve my name into his backside
and fill the wounds with salt !

53:10.080 --> 53:15.120
You're here, safe,
surrounded by brick and mortar.

53:15.200 --> 53:18.640
My prison is far crueler.
It has no walls.

53:18.720 --> 53:21.440
Everywhere I go,
they point and whisper.

53:21.520 --> 53:23.680
At the opera, they hiss at me
when I take my box.

53:23.760 --> 53:26.160
When I went to church, the priest
refused to even hear my confession.

53:26.240 --> 53:28.080
He said I was already damned.

53:28.160 --> 53:30.320
Why must I suffer for your sins ?

53:30.400 --> 53:34.000
That's the way
of all martyrs, isn't it ?

53:34.080 --> 53:36.880
Give me back my anonymity.
That's all I ask.

53:36.960 --> 53:38.840
Let me be invisible again.

53:38.920 --> 53:42.320
You tell me, have you ever done anything
to secure my release ? No.

53:42.400 --> 53:44.160
Have you petitioned the courts ? Never !

53:44.240 --> 53:48.560
- Sought an audience with the emperor ?
- How ? He refuses to see me !

53:48.640 --> 53:50.520
It's a convenience
having your husband locked away.

53:50.600 --> 53:53.120
You no longer have to hold your tongue
or hoist your skirts...

53:53.200 --> 53:56.960
or crack your mouth so I can
put it to its one pleasurable use.

53:57.040 --> 54:00.640
You're not my wife, no! You're one of
my many jailors. Aren't you?

54:00.720 --> 54:03.000
- What in God's name ?
- Take this cow away !

54:03.080 --> 54:05.320
I can't look at her !

54:05.400 --> 54:08.640
Perhaps you'll find a place for her
in the west wing among the hysterics !

54:08.720 --> 54:12.640
Lock her up as well
so she knows how it feels !

54:12.720 --> 54:16.960
The sow !

54:30.280 --> 54:34.560
For a woman of humble origin,
your wife has refined tastes.

54:34.640 --> 54:38.720
When I suggest granite for the foyer,
she's quick to counter
with Peruvian marble.

54:38.800 --> 54:41.080
Peruvian marble.
It costs a fortune to import.

54:41.120 --> 54:43.800
Whatever her heart desires,
Monsieur Prouix.

54:43.880 --> 54:47.280
I would like nothing better than
to grant her every wish, sir,

54:47.360 --> 54:49.680
but on the modest sum
you have accorded me-

54:49.760 --> 54:52.040
I'm an architect, not a magician.

54:52.120 --> 54:54.040
I must see the doctor at once.

54:54.120 --> 54:56.440
It's a matter of dire urgency.

54:56.480 --> 54:59.160
It is customary to write
and request an appointment.

54:59.240 --> 55:02.680
Desperation has driven me past
etiquette, all the way to frenzy.

55:02.760 --> 55:05.080
My schedule is not subject
to the whim of lunatics.

55:05.120 --> 55:08.480
I beg to differ, Doctor.
You work in a madhouse.

55:08.560 --> 55:12.600
Your every waking moment
is governed by the insane.

55:12.680 --> 55:14.680
I pray you, be succinct.

55:14.720 --> 55:16.600
You're new to Charenton, yes ?

55:16.640 --> 55:20.880
Perhaps you're not yet familiar
with my husband and his unusual case.

55:20.960 --> 55:23.000
With all due respect, madame,

55:23.080 --> 55:25.480
all France is familiar with your husband.

55:25.560 --> 55:29.080
Would you grant me a moment alone,
please, Monsieur Prouix ?

55:29.120 --> 55:31.160
Certainly sir. Your servant, sir.

55:31.240 --> 55:33.160
Uh, gentlemen.

55:33.240 --> 55:35.560
Madame, please.

55:43.480 --> 55:45.320
Good morning, madame.

55:45.400 --> 55:48.800
I assume you've come here to plead for
clemency on your husband's behalf.

55:48.880 --> 55:50.760
You do, do you ?

55:50.800 --> 55:53.000
It's my dearest hope, Doctor,

55:53.080 --> 55:56.720
that he remain entombed forever.

55:56.800 --> 55:59.480
And that when at last he perishes in
the dank bowels of your institution,

55:59.560 --> 56:02.920
that he be left as carrion
for the rodents and the worms.

56:03.000 --> 56:06.160
I stand corrected, madame.

56:06.240 --> 56:08.800
If you can't cure him...

56:08.880 --> 56:12.000
truly cure him...

56:12.040 --> 56:17.640
then at least, I beg you, harness the
beast that rages in his soul.

56:17.720 --> 56:21.960
That is not easily done, madame.

56:22.040 --> 56:25.240
You are aware, are you not,
that it costs a great deal...

56:25.320 --> 56:27.280
to house your husband at Charenton ?

56:27.360 --> 56:30.720
I pay his stipend every month,
far more dutifully than I should.

56:30.800 --> 56:33.560
But that barely covers
the cost of his room...

56:33.640 --> 56:38.080
with nary a penny left over
for appropriate treatments:

56:38.160 --> 56:41.160
opiates to quell his temper,

56:41.240 --> 56:45.360
restraints to chasten him
when he misbehaves.

56:45.440 --> 56:49.360
Perhaps, if you could buttress your
entreaties with the means to oblige them-

56:49.440 --> 56:51.560
I'm not a wealthy woman.

56:51.640 --> 56:53.760
You have a pension, haven't you ?

56:53.800 --> 56:57.280
- From the sale of his books ?
- It's tainted money, Doctor.

56:59.480 --> 57:01.640
- What a beautiful thought.
- What thought is that ?

57:01.720 --> 57:07.040
That the ill-gotten funds
born of his degeneracy...

57:07.120 --> 57:09.920
might now affect his salvation.

57:11.280 --> 57:14.440
It's beyond perversity...

57:14.520 --> 57:18.800
that honor should carry a price tag.

57:18.880 --> 57:20.760
Imagine...

57:20.840 --> 57:25.680
old friends deigning
to kiss your hand again.

57:29.200 --> 57:32.960
"Why, Marquise, enchanted to see
you again."

57:33.000 --> 57:37.440
"Welcome back from your long,
dark descent into the abyss of infamy."

57:37.520 --> 57:41.680
Don't toy with me, Doctor.

57:43.200 --> 57:47.400
Now is the time to secure your epitaph:

57:47.440 --> 57:49.640
"The benevolent Marquise,

57:49.720 --> 57:53.400
Charenton's most revered
philanthropist"...

57:55.960 --> 57:58.080
or "Satan's bride."

57:58.120 --> 58:00.520
Rest assured, Marquise,

58:00.600 --> 58:04.960
your generosity will speed your
husband ever faster towards a cure.

58:05.000 --> 58:07.840
The Peruvian marble,
without question.

58:11.080 --> 58:14.760
- I'm eternally in your debt.
- And I in yours, Marquise.

58:14.840 --> 58:19.320
Doctor, can I impart to you
his cruelest trick ?

58:19.400 --> 58:21.520
Of course.

58:21.600 --> 58:24.480
Once, long ago...

58:24.520 --> 58:27.280
in the folly of youth...

58:27.360 --> 58:30.680
he made me love him.

58:51.520 --> 58:56.360
Madeleine, my sweet, can you
smuggle me a quill and some ink ?

58:56.440 --> 58:58.280
I don't dare.

58:58.360 --> 59:01.240
The doctor's got his eye on you
sharper than ever now.

01:00:10.600 --> 01:00:14.160
Dr. Montalivet was,
politely put, diminutive.

01:00:14.240 --> 01:00:18.520
When flaccid, his member
was little more than a bobbin.

01:00:18.600 --> 01:00:22.440
And when inflamed,
it towered a mere four inches.

01:00:22.520 --> 01:00:27.320
To compensate, he strove to impress his
ladylove with a host of other endowments:

01:00:27.400 --> 01:00:31.680
fine wine, fresh game and a house as
large as his other fortunes were small.

01:00:31.720 --> 01:00:37.000
We've ceiling beams en route from
Provence.

01:00:37.080 --> 01:00:42.080
And next week,
a muralist from Paris arrives...

01:00:42.160 --> 01:00:45.080
to paint a trompe l'oeil
in the ballroom.

01:00:46.280 --> 01:00:49.440
- Doesn't that please you ?
- Very much.

01:00:51.560 --> 01:00:54.000
I would prefer brandy in the salon...

01:00:54.080 --> 01:00:58.160
where we can sit side by side
before the fire.

01:01:00.360 --> 01:01:02.240
I'd rather read, thank you.

01:01:04.680 --> 01:01:06.640
You prefer a book
to your husband's company ?

01:01:08.480 --> 01:01:12.640
Well, no wonder.
I'm only flesh and blood.

01:01:12.680 --> 01:01:17.440
That's no match, is it,
for the printed page, hmm ?

01:01:19.360 --> 01:01:23.200
Good evening then.
Enjoy your solitude.

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.840
Your linens, please.

01:01:37.480 --> 01:01:40.640
Your linens.

01:01:43.640 --> 01:01:46.440
Now or never.

01:01:46.520 --> 01:01:48.360
Voila !

01:02:03.760 --> 01:02:05.640
Well, if you won't read it
to your own mother,

01:02:05.680 --> 01:02:08.680
perhaps you ought not
to be reading it at all.

01:02:08.760 --> 01:02:10.640
It's not your cup of tea, Mother.

01:02:10.720 --> 01:02:15.480
Oh, go on, darling, give it a read.

01:02:19.760 --> 01:02:22.720
"Monsieur Bouloir was a man
whose erotic appetites...

01:02:22.760 --> 01:02:27.040
"might discreetly be described
as... postmortem.

01:02:27.120 --> 01:02:31.680
"A habitué of cemeteries,

01:02:31.760 --> 01:02:33.600
"his proudest conquest
was a maid...

01:02:33.680 --> 01:02:37.920
"six decades his senior,
deceased a dozen years."

01:02:37.960 --> 01:02:40.040
That's terrible.

01:02:40.120 --> 01:02:42.120
Oh, that's too, too terrible.

01:02:44.440 --> 01:02:46.600
Well, go on.

01:02:52.800 --> 01:02:55.000
"The vigor with which
he made love...

01:02:55.080 --> 01:02:57.160
Mm-hmm.

01:02:57.240 --> 01:02:59.200
"caused her bones to dislodge.

01:02:59.280 --> 01:03:00.640
"Still...

01:03:00.720 --> 01:03:05.400
"he granted her the highest compliment
he accorded any woman."

01:03:05.440 --> 01:03:07.840
Yes ?

01:03:07.880 --> 01:03:11.400
"Well worth the dig."

01:03:28.360 --> 01:03:30.200
You asked my name once.

01:03:32.600 --> 01:03:34.440
It's Madeleine.

01:03:35.520 --> 01:03:38.360
Sweet then, like the pastry.

01:03:39.840 --> 01:03:41.680
Haven't you a name yourself?

01:03:43.040 --> 01:03:46.720
Ride away with me someday.
Perhaps I'll tell you.

01:04:13.520 --> 01:04:18.680
Your mother may be blind,
but you have a keen pair of eyes.

01:04:18.720 --> 01:04:22.200
My mother is blind on account of
the lye in the laundry kettles.

01:04:22.280 --> 01:04:25.960
Soaking sheets for lunatics
has cost this woman her sight.

01:04:26.040 --> 01:04:28.600
- This could cost her far more.
- You'll get more from her
with kindness than-

01:04:28.640 --> 01:04:31.600
What could cause
a tincture like this ?

01:04:31.680 --> 01:04:34.520
- I'm only a laundress, not a detective.
- Now is not the time-

01:04:34.560 --> 01:04:36.880
Perhaps your kettles
are stained with rust.

01:04:36.960 --> 01:04:39.680
Or maybe the lye is rancid.

01:04:39.760 --> 01:04:43.080
Or maybe, just maybe...

01:04:43.160 --> 01:04:46.760
these sheets once belonged
to our friend the marquis.

01:04:49.680 --> 01:04:53.400
We've over 200 beds.
They could have been anybody's.

01:04:53.440 --> 01:04:57.320
With such a fine thread count,
decorated in his very own script ?

01:04:57.400 --> 01:05:00.840
She's lying. It shows on her face.

01:05:06.720 --> 01:05:11.000
We're clearing everything out.

01:05:11.080 --> 01:05:13.760
- Almost done, sir.
- Remember, anything
he could fashion as a quill.

01:05:13.840 --> 01:05:15.680
His entire room stripped bare.

01:05:15.760 --> 01:05:19.200
So the doctor cracks his whip
and you dance !

01:05:19.280 --> 01:05:21.840
My bed, gone.
Am I to freeze to death ?

01:05:21.920 --> 01:05:23.760
Go on, take his rug.

01:05:25.920 --> 01:05:28.240
- Take it.
- That's a Turkish weave, you idiot.

01:05:28.320 --> 01:05:30.200
It costs more than
you'll earn in a lifetime.

01:05:30.240 --> 01:05:34.960
- His chair.
- Fine. Take it. Take it all.

01:05:35.040 --> 01:05:36.880
- Here.
- There you go.

01:05:39.360 --> 01:05:41.240
And this-
Careful, it's slippery.

01:05:41.280 --> 01:05:43.160
You've no idea where it's been.

01:05:43.200 --> 01:05:45.400
Let's not forget Mary. Sweet Mary,

01:05:45.440 --> 01:05:47.800
the Jewish whore. God's little harlot.

01:05:47.840 --> 01:05:51.920
Virgin birth ? An entire religion
built on an oxymoron.

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:53.840
His wine.

01:05:56.960 --> 01:05:59.760
From now on, nothing but water
at every meal.

01:05:59.840 --> 01:06:02.320
- Water ?
- And your meat shall be deboned.

01:06:02.400 --> 01:06:05.640
- Why this sudden torture ?
- Because your writing continues unchecked.

01:06:05.720 --> 01:06:09.600
- I didn't create this world of ours.
I only record it.
- Its horrors, perhaps.

01:06:09.680 --> 01:06:11.680
Its darkest nightmares.
And to what end ?

01:06:11.760 --> 01:06:15.320
- Nothing but your own morbid gratification.
- No, I write what I see:

01:06:15.360 --> 01:06:17.280
the endless procession
to the guillotine.

01:06:17.360 --> 01:06:21.080
We're all lined up,
waiting for the crunch of the blade.

01:06:21.120 --> 01:06:25.480
The rivers of blood are flowing
beneath our feet, Abbé.

01:06:25.560 --> 01:06:27.640
I've been to hell, young man.

01:06:27.680 --> 01:06:30.440
You've only read about it.

01:06:34.240 --> 01:06:37.000
I'm sorry, Marquis, truly.

01:06:37.080 --> 01:06:40.240
These chastity vows of yours-
How strict are they ?

01:06:40.320 --> 01:06:43.920
Suppose you only put it
in their mouth ?

01:06:48.800 --> 01:06:50.720
Pious little worm.

01:06:51.960 --> 01:06:55.800
In conditions of adversity,
the artist flourishes.

01:07:08.520 --> 01:07:10.400
Curious, aren't you ?

01:07:10.440 --> 01:07:14.600
If I can pleasure myself,
I can pleasure you too.

01:07:14.680 --> 01:07:17.720
You don't know
what you're missing, darling.

01:07:25.480 --> 01:07:28.840
I'm in search of a book.
Perhaps you know it.

01:07:32.280 --> 01:07:34.560
I've only got one copy left.

01:07:34.640 --> 01:07:38.560
Rescued it meself from the bonfire.

01:07:38.640 --> 01:07:43.160
Please hurry.
My husband locks the door at dusk.

01:07:43.200 --> 01:07:46.200
Sweet little thing like you...

01:07:46.240 --> 01:07:49.120
shouldn't be reading such filth anyway.

01:07:49.200 --> 01:07:51.600
I grew up in a convent, sir.

01:07:51.680 --> 01:07:53.800
Everything I know in the world,
I owe to books.

01:08:18.720 --> 01:08:20.960
To the young maidens of the world,

01:08:21.040 --> 01:08:24.120
wrest yourselves free
from the tyranny of virtue...

01:08:24.200 --> 01:08:27.279
and taste without shame
the pleasures of the flesh.

01:08:27.359 --> 01:08:30.120
Male power lies in the clench of a fist,

01:08:30.200 --> 01:08:32.880
but a woman's power lies elsewhere:

01:08:32.960 --> 01:08:36.200
in the velvet cavity
betwixt her thighs.

01:08:36.279 --> 01:08:39.000
It's late, Simone, darling.

01:08:39.040 --> 01:08:41.120
Put your poems aside.

01:09:43.880 --> 01:09:45.720
Breakfast.

01:09:49.359 --> 01:09:52.000
Madeleine, I beg you-

01:09:52.080 --> 01:09:55.440
What have they done to you now ?

01:09:55.520 --> 01:09:59.400
Tortures so ugly, so medieval...

01:09:59.480 --> 01:10:02.080
even I haven't the words
to describe them.

01:10:02.160 --> 01:10:06.000
If you have an ounce
of pity in your heart,

01:10:06.080 --> 01:10:08.760
you'll throw caution aside...

01:10:08.840 --> 01:10:11.200
and unlock my door.

01:10:12.840 --> 01:10:15.640
God help me.

01:10:15.720 --> 01:10:18.840
- I don't dare.
- Don't be a dunce, child.
I have a surprise for you.

01:10:18.920 --> 01:10:20.760
Now open the friggin' door.

01:10:37.560 --> 01:10:39.600
My newest book.

01:10:41.320 --> 01:10:43.680
It starts at my left cuff...

01:10:43.760 --> 01:10:46.880
and continues right across my back.

01:10:46.960 --> 01:10:49.680
The longest sentence, you'll notice,

01:10:49.720 --> 01:10:52.760
runs the entire length of my inseam.

01:10:52.840 --> 01:10:56.200
And it all completes itself...

01:10:56.280 --> 01:10:59.120
at the base of my right shoe.

01:11:08.600 --> 01:11:10.600
- Oh, my. "Pikestaff" ?
- Yes.

01:11:12.600 --> 01:11:15.080
- Yes.

01:11:17.080 --> 01:11:20.600
- "Naked on a plate" ?
- Yes.

01:11:20.680 --> 01:11:24.840
"One hundred unhurried tongues" ?

01:11:24.920 --> 01:11:26.760
Yes.

01:11:26.840 --> 01:11:28.720
- You're a genius !
- Yes !

01:11:28.760 --> 01:11:30.640
Shh !

01:11:33.320 --> 01:11:36.160
Go quickly...

01:11:36.240 --> 01:11:38.840
so you won't be blamed
for my  misbehavior.

01:11:38.920 --> 01:11:43.680
Maddie, you traffic with the devil,
you'll pay the devil's price.

01:11:43.760 --> 01:11:46.160
- Sorry.
- Guards !

01:11:46.240 --> 01:11:48.760
- Guards !
- Yes !

01:11:48.840 --> 01:11:52.120
- Shh !
- You'll pay ! Guards !

01:11:54.200 --> 01:11:57.880
Look what I've brought you,
my darlings.

01:11:57.960 --> 01:12:02.320
- There's something written.
- Two chapters, one for each cheek.

01:12:10.640 --> 01:12:15.840
My writing lives !

01:12:25.200 --> 01:12:30.080
Take this beast back to his cage !

01:12:30.160 --> 01:12:33.080
Don't tell me.
You've come to read my trousers.

01:12:33.160 --> 01:12:37.040
Don't keep me in suspense. What will it
be, 50 lashes ? A night on the rack ?

01:12:38.520 --> 01:12:42.320
I won't sully my hands with him.

01:12:42.360 --> 01:12:44.960
Nor should you. That's the first
rule of politics, isn't it ?

01:12:45.040 --> 01:12:48.400
The man who orders the execution
never drops the blade !

01:12:50.360 --> 01:12:52.560
You're fortunate
they've forced me to punish you.

01:12:52.600 --> 01:12:55.040
If it were up to the doctor,
you'd be flayed alive.

01:12:55.120 --> 01:12:57.760
Well, the doctor is a man
after my own heart.

01:12:57.840 --> 01:13:00.160
What in God's name
am I to do with you ?

01:13:00.240 --> 01:13:02.400
The more I forbid,
the more you're provoked.

01:13:04.600 --> 01:13:06.360
Strip.

01:13:42.200 --> 01:13:44.920
Your britches as well.

01:13:46.960 --> 01:13:50.080
You started this little game...

01:13:50.160 --> 01:13:52.600
you finish it.

01:13:52.680 --> 01:13:54.640
Or haven't you the courage ?

01:13:58.200 --> 01:14:00.040
I thought not.

01:14:19.080 --> 01:14:23.400
It's a potent aphrodisiac,

01:14:23.480 --> 01:14:26.560
isn't it, dumpling ?

01:14:26.640 --> 01:14:30.840
Having power over another man.

01:14:35.480 --> 01:14:37.800
Your wig.

01:14:56.400 --> 01:15:00.160
You'll no longer
spread your insidious gospel.

01:15:00.240 --> 01:15:02.560
From now on,

01:15:02.640 --> 01:15:06.960
you will not even write
your own ignominious name.

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:09.080
Are your convictions
so fragile,

01:15:09.160 --> 01:15:11.560
they cannot stand
in opposition to mine ?

01:15:11.640 --> 01:15:16.720
Is your God so flimsy, so weak ?
For shame !

01:15:18.320 --> 01:15:20.880
Don't flatter yourself, Marquis.

01:15:20.920 --> 01:15:23.440
You're not the Antichrist.

01:15:23.520 --> 01:15:27.640
You're nothing but a malcontent
who knows how to spell.

01:15:36.880 --> 01:15:39.240
I saw her with my own eyes.

01:15:39.280 --> 01:15:42.600
She put the key in the latch
just as proud as she pleased.

01:16:03.440 --> 01:16:06.600
Free her now !

01:16:06.640 --> 01:16:08.560
Leave her duly strung.

01:16:14.160 --> 01:16:16.200
Maddie.

01:16:20.240 --> 01:16:22.520
If only blood will appease you,

01:16:25.840 --> 01:16:28.080
then shed mine !

01:16:29.360 --> 01:16:31.560
- Abbé, no.
- Go on.

01:16:31.600 --> 01:16:34.600
Now !

01:16:34.640 --> 01:16:36.760
That won't be necessary.

01:16:38.280 --> 01:16:40.560
If you're going to
martyr yourself, Abbé,

01:16:40.640 --> 01:16:43.520
do it for God, not a chambermaid.

01:16:47.480 --> 01:16:50.520
Now put your clothes back on.

01:17:04.320 --> 01:17:07.520
Had I known your taste in novels,

01:17:07.600 --> 01:17:10.280
I never would have taught you to read.

01:17:10.320 --> 01:17:12.360
Don't say that.

01:17:12.440 --> 01:17:15.160
Reading's my salvation.

01:17:15.240 --> 01:17:19.440
But why must you indulge
in his pornography ?

01:17:19.480 --> 01:17:21.720
It's a hard day's wages,
slaving away for madmen.

01:17:21.800 --> 01:17:24.480
What I've seen in life,

01:17:24.560 --> 01:17:28.080
it takes a lot to hold my interest.

01:17:35.120 --> 01:17:38.120
I put myself in his stories.

01:17:38.200 --> 01:17:40.680
I play the parts.

01:17:40.720 --> 01:17:44.200
- Each strumpet, each murderess.
- Oh, Maddie-

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:49.600
If I wasn't such a bad woman
on the page,

01:17:49.680 --> 01:17:53.720
I'll hazard I couldn't be
such a good woman in life.

01:18:07.840 --> 01:18:10.760
This is no place for a child like you.

01:18:10.800 --> 01:18:14.280
I'm sending you away from here.

01:18:15.640 --> 01:18:18.240
And then we take the whole den
till up there.

01:18:18.320 --> 01:18:20.560
Now this is not good enough.
You understand ?

01:18:20.640 --> 01:18:23.040
I refuse to pay-

01:18:23.120 --> 01:18:25.840
We could line the walls
with Chinese silks.

01:18:25.880 --> 01:18:30.160
Or, if you prefer,
a Florentine tapestry.

01:18:31.920 --> 01:18:35.880
- Are you a literary man ?
- Excuse me ?

01:18:35.920 --> 01:18:40.080
I do so admire men
with an appetite for...

01:18:41.680 --> 01:18:44.440
books.

01:18:53.680 --> 01:18:57.840
Madame, how could you ?

01:18:59.440 --> 01:19:01.520
Have you actually read this volume ?

01:19:03.280 --> 01:19:05.160
I've memorized it.

01:19:11.280 --> 01:19:14.520
There comes a time
in a young lady's life...

01:19:14.600 --> 01:19:16.440
when she must cast books aside...

01:19:16.520 --> 01:19:20.080
and learn from experience.

01:19:21.360 --> 01:19:23.560
That, monsieur...

01:19:23.600 --> 01:19:25.480
requires a teacher.

01:19:56.160 --> 01:19:59.240
Oh, yes, come on. We'll have some fun.

01:20:10.480 --> 01:20:14.040
Maddie, what are you-

01:20:15.600 --> 01:20:17.480
Is something wrong ?

01:20:19.280 --> 01:20:24.080
Abbé, don't send me away, I beg you.

01:20:24.160 --> 01:20:26.880
I shouldn't refuse your kindness...

01:20:26.960 --> 01:20:29.960
but my heart's held fast here.

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:33.520
By whom ? The marquis ?

01:20:35.840 --> 01:20:38.960
Mother's not half so blind as you.

01:20:42.240 --> 01:20:44.240
Oh, Madeleine.

01:20:48.240 --> 01:20:53.680
There are certain feelings...
we must not voice.

01:20:53.760 --> 01:20:56.120
Why not ?

01:20:56.200 --> 01:20:58.640
They incite-

01:20:58.720 --> 01:21:01.200
They incite us to act...

01:21:01.280 --> 01:21:03.480
in ways...

01:21:03.560 --> 01:21:05.400
we should not.

01:21:08.080 --> 01:21:09.960
No.

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:13.480
What have I done ?

01:21:13.520 --> 01:21:15.720
Go. Go back to your room quickly.

01:21:15.760 --> 01:21:18.360
You'll hate me now, won't you ?

01:21:18.440 --> 01:21:21.680
No. I love you, Madeleine...

01:21:21.720 --> 01:21:23.600
as a child of God.

01:21:27.560 --> 01:21:30.320
Forgive me.

01:21:42.840 --> 01:21:45.640
Madeleine.

01:22:02.960 --> 01:22:05.480
Maddie.

01:22:05.520 --> 01:22:08.520
You don't fear the marquis' sway on me.

01:22:08.560 --> 01:22:11.560
You fear your own.

01:22:11.600 --> 01:22:17.000
If you'd grant me a final favor,
I'd like to explain myself.

01:22:19.120 --> 01:22:22.840
Don't come any closer, Abbé.
God's watching.

01:22:26.960 --> 01:22:28.840
Maddie-

01:22:33.800 --> 01:22:37.480
"Most esteemed Dr. Royer-Collard,

01:22:37.520 --> 01:22:40.760
"At long last your chateau is complete.

01:22:40.840 --> 01:22:43.920
"You will find everything
in its assigned place:

01:22:43.960 --> 01:22:47.320
"the chintz draperies,
the English bell pulls,

01:22:47.400 --> 01:22:50.200
"even the ivory doorstops.

01:22:50.280 --> 01:22:55.480
"Only one detail is missing-

01:22:59.240 --> 01:23:01.240
"Your wife."

01:23:05.920 --> 01:23:08.440
Tell him I'm no fool.

01:23:08.480 --> 01:23:10.360
A prison is still a prison,

01:23:10.400 --> 01:23:13.080
even with Chinese silks
and chandeliers.

01:23:13.120 --> 01:23:16.080
"By the time you read this,
we'll be long gone.

01:23:16.160 --> 01:23:19.480
"Bound for England
or points beyond."

01:23:19.520 --> 01:23:22.200
Tell him if he discovers
our whereabouts,

01:23:22.240 --> 01:23:25.760
you'll slit your wrist with a razor and
I'll plunge a hat pin through my heart.

01:23:25.840 --> 01:23:30.760
You'd do that...
rather than forsake our love ?

01:23:30.840 --> 01:23:34.400
No... but tell him I would.

01:23:37.080 --> 01:23:40.040
Sign it... quickly.

01:23:40.120 --> 01:23:44.920
Then you can ravish me again on
linens for which he so dearly paid.

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:47.800
And then, I beg you,

01:23:47.840 --> 01:23:51.080
on the bearskin rug in his study.

01:23:51.160 --> 01:23:55.640
And finally, as a crowning gesture,

01:23:55.720 --> 01:24:00.040
we'll leave puddles of love
on the Peruvian marble.

01:24:14.640 --> 01:24:16.480
Simone !

01:24:16.560 --> 01:24:20.520
Simone ! Simone ?

01:24:20.600 --> 01:24:22.760
Simone ?

01:24:56.880 --> 01:25:00.280
Stop !

01:25:00.360 --> 01:25:02.280
Stop ! I beg you !

01:25:02.360 --> 01:25:05.800
I'll write dainty stories,
odes to virtue.

01:25:05.880 --> 01:25:07.960
Children's verse. I promise !

01:25:10.920 --> 01:25:13.960
It excites you, doesn't it,
to hurt me thus ?

01:25:14.040 --> 01:25:17.000
Look, you're solid as bone,
straining your trousers.

01:25:21.160 --> 01:25:25.560
Don't you see,
you self-righteous fuck ?

01:25:25.640 --> 01:25:27.480
The longer you continue
your vexations,

01:25:27.560 --> 01:25:30.600
the deeper you root
my principles in my heart !

01:25:51.640 --> 01:25:54.160
Haven't you seen...

01:25:54.200 --> 01:25:58.160
a man naked before ?

01:26:04.680 --> 01:26:06.680
The abbe's sending me away.

01:26:06.760 --> 01:26:09.240
Yes.

01:26:09.320 --> 01:26:11.200
Of course he is.

01:26:11.280 --> 01:26:13.640
Marquis...

01:26:17.160 --> 01:26:19.080
tell me one little story.

01:26:27.360 --> 01:26:30.000
How do you propose I do that ?

01:26:30.080 --> 01:26:32.200
With dust upon the air ?

01:26:32.280 --> 01:26:35.120
Whisper it to me now.

01:26:35.160 --> 01:26:37.520
Child, that's far too dangerous.

01:26:37.560 --> 01:26:39.440
I may never see you again.

01:26:39.480 --> 01:26:42.320
Let me transcribe it for you,
something to remember you by.

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:48.080
This is neither the time
nor the place.

01:26:48.120 --> 01:26:50.120
We've lost.

01:26:54.080 --> 01:26:56.000
I never thought I'd see you defeated.

01:26:56.080 --> 01:26:57.920
There are thousands of stories...

01:26:58.000 --> 01:26:59.840
I would dearly love to tell.

01:26:59.920 --> 01:27:02.400
Then tell me one.

01:27:11.800 --> 01:27:13.640
Perhaps I can.

01:27:14.800 --> 01:27:16.600
Tonight, place yourself
in the linen pantry...

01:27:16.640 --> 01:27:18.640
with a bottle of ink and a quill.

01:27:18.680 --> 01:27:21.560
And then you shall have a story...

01:27:21.640 --> 01:27:24.440
that will make the angels weep...

01:27:24.480 --> 01:27:26.720
and the saints all gasp for air.

01:27:52.680 --> 01:27:55.200
Psst, she's here.

01:27:57.720 --> 01:27:59.840
Dauphin. Dauphin.

01:28:01.320 --> 01:28:03.160
Dauphin.

01:28:04.880 --> 01:28:07.840
Cleante. Cleante.

01:28:07.920 --> 01:28:10.520
Psst, Cleante, are you ready ?

01:28:10.600 --> 01:28:12.920
- Are you ready ?
- Marquis, is that you ?

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:16.160
For fuck's sake, who else would it be ?
Have you alerted the others ?

01:28:16.240 --> 01:28:18.960
I'm no longer a man.

01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:21.520
I awoke to discover I turned into
a sparrow.

01:28:21.600 --> 01:28:25.240
Is that so ?

01:28:25.320 --> 01:28:27.560
Well, I awoke to discover
I'd turned into a cat !

01:28:27.640 --> 01:28:31.160
If you don't do as I say, I'll sink my
little fangs into your drumsticks...

01:28:31.240 --> 01:28:33.160
and suck the marrow
straight out of your bones !

01:28:33.240 --> 01:28:35.840
Have you got that, little bird ?

01:28:37.440 --> 01:28:40.400
At your service, Count.

01:28:41.840 --> 01:28:44.520
To my beloved reader,

01:28:44.600 --> 01:28:47.400
prepare yourself
for the most impure tale...

01:28:47.480 --> 01:28:50.320
ever to spring from the mind of man.

01:28:51.280 --> 01:28:52.160
Off your hump.

01:28:56.320 --> 01:28:59.680
Dauphin. To my beloved reader,

01:28:59.760 --> 01:29:02.280
prepare yourself for the most...

01:29:02.360 --> 01:29:04.480
impure tale ever told.

01:29:07.960 --> 01:29:10.120
To my beloved reader,

01:29:10.200 --> 01:29:13.960
prepare yourself for an impure tale.

01:29:17.160 --> 01:29:19.680
- Psst, Bouchon.
- Huh ?

01:29:19.760 --> 01:29:22.040
To my beloved reader, prepare yourself.

01:29:22.120 --> 01:29:25.360
I have an impure tale to tell.

01:29:26.960 --> 01:29:30.360
Prepare yourself.

01:29:30.440 --> 01:29:33.160
Bouchon ?

01:29:33.240 --> 01:29:36.760
What did you say ?

01:29:36.800 --> 01:29:41.560
Prepare yourself.
I've a tale, an impure tale.

01:29:44.600 --> 01:29:47.320
Our story concerns
the prostitute, Fauchau,

01:29:47.400 --> 01:29:49.680
whom nature had equipped...

01:29:49.720 --> 01:29:54.200
with a tight and tiny fissure
between her thighs...

01:29:54.240 --> 01:29:58.520
and the most finely
cleft ass ever molded...

01:29:58.560 --> 01:30:00.840
by the hand of God.

01:30:02.840 --> 01:30:05.400
Fauchau was a prostitute...

01:30:05.440 --> 01:30:09.600
with a tight and downy fissure...

01:30:09.680 --> 01:30:12.840
between her thighs and-

01:30:12.920 --> 01:30:14.800
The most finely cleft ass !

01:30:14.880 --> 01:30:18.200
The most finely cleft ass.

01:30:18.280 --> 01:30:22.840
My glorious prose filtered
through the minds of the insane.

01:30:22.920 --> 01:30:25.080
Who knows, they might improve it.

01:30:25.120 --> 01:30:28.120
It's about a harlot named Fauchau.

01:30:28.200 --> 01:30:30.080
It's about a harlot...

01:30:30.160 --> 01:30:33.600
named Fauchau with a downy fissure.

01:30:33.680 --> 01:30:37.600
One day, Fauchau's first client
was a surgeon.

01:30:37.680 --> 01:30:41.240
He ran his fingers across her
naked skin,

01:30:41.320 --> 01:30:43.640
pulling apart folds of flesh.

01:30:43.720 --> 01:30:46.360
He ran his fingers
across her naked skin,

01:30:46.440 --> 01:30:49.560
pulling apart folds of flesh.

01:30:49.640 --> 01:30:53.240
Pulling at her folds and-

01:30:53.320 --> 01:30:56.120
He ran his fingers
over her naked skin,

01:30:56.160 --> 01:30:58.360
pulling at her folds.

01:30:58.400 --> 01:31:02.720
Feeling over her naked skin.

01:31:02.800 --> 01:31:05.080
Her naked skin.

01:31:05.120 --> 01:31:09.480
- Naked-
- Yes, I've got that bit.

01:31:09.560 --> 01:31:11.520
"What shall I make ready ?"
asked Fauchau.

01:31:11.600 --> 01:31:13.880
"My mouth, my ass...

01:31:13.960 --> 01:31:17.080
or my succulent oyster ?"

01:31:17.160 --> 01:31:19.080
What shall I make ready ?

01:31:19.160 --> 01:31:22.040
My ass or my succulent oyster ?

01:31:22.120 --> 01:31:25.120
"None !" cried the surgeon,
brandishing his scalpel.

01:31:25.200 --> 01:31:29.040
- Yes ?
- Which hole ?

01:31:29.120 --> 01:31:33.840
My mouth, my ass or my succulent-

01:31:33.880 --> 01:31:36.280
succulent oyster.

01:31:36.360 --> 01:31:41.200
"For I'll carve new orifices
where there were none before."

01:31:41.280 --> 01:31:43.400
- None-
- Cried the surgeon.

01:31:43.480 --> 01:31:49.120
I'll carve new-new-new orifices
where there were none before.

01:31:49.200 --> 01:31:53.960
With that, Fauchau expelled a scream
so extravagantly pitched...

01:31:54.040 --> 01:31:57.360
that the surgeon was obliged
to tear out her tongue.

01:31:57.440 --> 01:32:01.120
Fauchau expelled a scream
of such extravagant pitch-

01:32:01.200 --> 01:32:03.240
With that, the extravagant bitch-

01:32:03.320 --> 01:32:05.720
- screamed so loud-
- She screamed...

01:32:05.800 --> 01:32:07.960
so long and so loud-

01:32:08.040 --> 01:32:12.200
She screamed, so he felt
he should- He ought-

01:32:12.280 --> 01:32:15.880
- To seal the wound,
he took a poker from the fire.
- A poker !

01:32:15.960 --> 01:32:18.360
To tear out her tongue.

01:32:18.440 --> 01:32:22.240
-He took a poker from the fire.
-From the fire. From the fire !

01:32:23.680 --> 01:32:26.840
He took a poker from the fire.

01:32:26.880 --> 01:32:30.920
From the fire.
From the fire.

01:32:31.040 --> 01:32:34.680
He took a poker from the fire.

01:32:34.760 --> 01:32:37.120
From the fire.

01:32:39.600 --> 01:32:42.000
- Dauphin.
- From the fire.

01:32:42.080 --> 01:32:44.760
- What's the next bit ?
- Bouchon, the words ?

01:32:44.840 --> 01:32:48.520
- Tell me the words.
- Fire.

01:32:55.480 --> 01:32:58.160
Dauphin ?

01:32:58.240 --> 01:33:00.080
Dauphin ?

01:33:00.160 --> 01:33:02.200
- Fire !
- What's the next bit ?

01:33:02.280 --> 01:33:06.200
- Fire ! Fire.
- What's the next bit ?

01:33:06.280 --> 01:33:09.840
- Fire ! Fire !
- Tell me the next bit !

01:33:09.920 --> 01:33:12.680
You must tell me the words.

01:33:12.760 --> 01:33:17.160
Fire !

01:33:17.240 --> 01:33:21.440
Open all the doors !
Let the patients out!

01:33:21.480 --> 01:33:24.640
Get some water !
Hurry ! Come on !

01:33:24.720 --> 01:33:27.440
Get some water !

01:33:27.520 --> 01:33:30.280
Jesus ! What the hell have you done ?

01:33:39.400 --> 01:33:42.240
Where's that water ?

01:33:42.280 --> 01:33:45.480
Get the beds ! Stomp them out!

01:33:45.560 --> 01:33:53.160
Fire ! Fire !

01:33:53.240 --> 01:33:55.400
Fire !

01:33:57.160 --> 01:33:59.400
Where are you going with that ?

01:34:02.760 --> 01:34:05.000
Bouchon ?

01:34:09.560 --> 01:34:11.640
Bouchon ?

01:34:12.840 --> 01:34:15.400
Remember your manners, Bouchon.

01:34:15.480 --> 01:34:17.320
Don't-

01:34:17.400 --> 01:34:20.080
- No ! No ! No !
- Madeleine.

01:34:20.160 --> 01:34:22.920
Madeleine !

01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:25.200
- Madeleine !
- Madeleine !

01:34:25.280 --> 01:34:27.120
- Madeleine!
- Madeleine !

01:34:27.200 --> 01:34:29.480
Madeleine!

01:34:29.560 --> 01:34:32.920
- Madeleine!
- Madeleine.

01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:36.200
Madeleine! Madeleine!

01:34:36.280 --> 01:34:38.280
Madeleine!

01:34:39.640 --> 01:34:43.080
Madeleine! Madeleine!

01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:54.920
Maddie ?

01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:58.040
Madeleine !

01:35:06.360 --> 01:35:08.280
- Maddie !
- It's awful !

01:35:08.360 --> 01:35:10.880
The devil's unleashed himself
upon us !

01:35:10.920 --> 01:35:12.800
It's her fault !

01:35:15.160 --> 01:35:16.960
Up the stairs !

01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:20.480
No! No! No!

01:35:28.200 --> 01:35:30.160
No ! No ! No !

01:35:30.240 --> 01:35:31.920
Maddie !

01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:35.680
Madeleine ! Madeleine !

01:35:39.520 --> 01:35:43.880
We must save Charenton!
Keep the chain going !

01:35:43.960 --> 01:35:47.960
We've got to stop it
before it gets to those beams !

01:35:52.160 --> 01:35:54.640
Get him off of me !

01:35:54.720 --> 01:35:56.560
Pitou !

01:36:00.960 --> 01:36:02.960
- Madeleine !
- Madeleine !

01:36:07.840 --> 01:36:11.040
Guards ! Guards !

01:36:11.080 --> 01:36:12.960
Guards !

01:36:14.560 --> 01:36:16.880
Brigitte. Are you all right ?

01:36:21.160 --> 01:36:27.760
Madeleine !

01:36:28.960 --> 01:36:31.640
Go ! Quickly !

01:36:31.720 --> 01:36:34.000
Madeleine !

01:36:37.120 --> 01:36:39.280
Where are you, Maddie ?

01:36:51.920 --> 01:36:53.800
"She screamed...

01:36:53.840 --> 01:36:56.920
so he felt he ought
to tear out her tongue."

01:37:00.720 --> 01:37:02.560
Bouchon, wait !

01:37:06.800 --> 01:37:10.560
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Abbé.
I couldn't help it.

01:37:13.120 --> 01:37:14.960
No.

01:37:15.040 --> 01:37:17.600
Oh, my God.

01:37:17.680 --> 01:37:19.680
No.

01:37:27.600 --> 01:37:31.480
Oh, no.

01:38:19.440 --> 01:38:21.320
Madeleine!

01:38:53.840 --> 01:38:57.000
Now, now, don't be shy.

01:38:57.040 --> 01:39:00.240
We've a nice surprise
just waiting for you.

01:39:00.320 --> 01:39:03.080
There's a good boy.

01:39:03.120 --> 01:39:05.080
Huh ?

01:39:13.440 --> 01:39:16.840
Huh ! There's a good boy.

01:39:16.880 --> 01:39:18.760
Huh ?

01:39:20.080 --> 01:39:22.280
I'm sorry. Wait.

01:39:22.320 --> 01:39:24.520
I promise I won't do it again.

01:39:24.560 --> 01:39:26.440
I promise.

01:39:27.760 --> 01:39:29.960
Of course, we mustn't blame Bouchon.

01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:33.160
He is merely one of nature's
experiments gone awry.

01:39:33.200 --> 01:39:36.680
No discipline, no conscience, no morality.

01:39:36.720 --> 01:39:39.240
In fact, it is our duty...

01:39:39.280 --> 01:39:42.920
to provide such things on his behalf.

01:39:42.960 --> 01:39:45.240
Is it not ?

01:39:45.320 --> 01:39:47.960
As you say, Doctor.

01:39:48.040 --> 01:39:50.840
He was so impressed
by the marquis' tale...

01:39:50.920 --> 01:39:55.320
that he chose to reenact it, yes ?

01:39:55.400 --> 01:39:58.920
Upon a certain chambermaid.

01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:04.280
Perhaps you would be so kind
as to remind me of her name.

01:40:04.360 --> 01:40:07.640
I beg you, Doctor, don't make me
say it.

01:40:07.720 --> 01:40:10.200
Her name, Abbé.

01:40:11.880 --> 01:40:13.880
Madeleine.

01:40:15.400 --> 01:40:17.720
Tell me, Abbé,

01:40:17.800 --> 01:40:20.080
when you are called before God,

01:40:20.160 --> 01:40:24.680
how will you answer
for Madeleine's death ?

01:40:34.480 --> 01:40:39.280
Murderer.

01:40:43.840 --> 01:40:45.800
Your words-

01:40:45.880 --> 01:40:48.080
Your words drove Bouchon to-

01:40:48.120 --> 01:40:50.120
Oh, for fuck's sake, Abbé !

01:40:50.200 --> 01:40:54.000
Suppose one of your precious inmates
attempted to walk on water and drowned ?

01:40:54.040 --> 01:40:57.640
Would you condemn the Bible ?
I think not.

01:40:57.680 --> 01:41:01.160
An innocent child is dead.

01:41:01.240 --> 01:41:03.600
So many authors are denied
the gratification...

01:41:03.640 --> 01:41:06.600
of a concrete response to their work.

01:41:06.680 --> 01:41:10.240
I'm blessed, am I not ?

01:41:11.960 --> 01:41:13.880
It's no secret that you loved her.

01:41:13.960 --> 01:41:17.320
I wanted to fuck her, that's all.

01:41:17.400 --> 01:41:21.360
- And did you ?
- It's not your province to ask.

01:41:21.440 --> 01:41:24.520
- Why was it you never
took her by force ?
- Who's to say I did not ?

01:41:24.600 --> 01:41:26.600
- Was it impotence ?
- Never !

01:41:26.680 --> 01:41:30.000
Then... it must have been love.

01:41:30.040 --> 01:41:32.920
I fucked her countless times...

01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:37.200
and all the while she pleaded for more.

01:41:37.280 --> 01:41:39.600
We inspected the body.

01:41:42.480 --> 01:41:45.200
She died a virgin.

01:42:23.400 --> 01:42:27.240
Give her... a proper burial...

01:42:27.320 --> 01:42:30.080
in the churchyard...

01:42:30.160 --> 01:42:32.000
at my expense.

01:42:33.200 --> 01:42:35.080
Do not inter...

01:42:35.120 --> 01:42:38.320
her sweet body...

01:42:38.400 --> 01:42:40.840
in the same ground...

01:42:40.880 --> 01:42:44.400
as the devils who inhabit
this accursed place.

01:42:45.920 --> 01:42:50.160
Your terrible secret revealed.

01:42:50.240 --> 01:42:52.080
You're a man after all.

01:43:06.080 --> 01:43:07.920
I've opium to numb the pain.

01:43:09.200 --> 01:43:11.280
Our intention is punitive.

01:43:11.360 --> 01:43:13.720
If we numb the pain,
what's the point ?

01:43:21.760 --> 01:43:24.240
Abbé de Coulmier.

01:43:24.320 --> 01:43:26.160
I'm here.

01:43:29.040 --> 01:43:32.080
Would that I were so easily silenced.

01:43:34.160 --> 01:43:36.400
There's a good boy.

01:44:23.680 --> 01:44:26.960
My, my.

01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:29.680
You have exceeded my expectations.

01:44:29.720 --> 01:44:34.840
Have I ? I'm not the first man God
has asked to shed blood in His name.

01:44:36.120 --> 01:44:38.160
I will not be the last.

01:44:39.480 --> 01:44:41.480
And will you sleep soundly tonight ?

01:44:41.560 --> 01:44:44.080
No, sir.

01:44:44.120 --> 01:44:46.800
Plainly put,

01:44:46.840 --> 01:44:50.160
I never expect to sleep again.

01:47:20.880 --> 01:47:24.120
Don't send me away, Abbé.

01:47:27.320 --> 01:47:29.760
Abbé. Abbé.

01:47:29.840 --> 01:47:32.560
Abbé-

01:47:32.600 --> 01:47:40.320
Abbé. Abbé.

01:47:40.400 --> 01:47:43.960
Abbé! Abbé!

01:47:47.800 --> 01:47:51.080
You best come quick, Abbé !

01:47:51.160 --> 01:47:53.160
He's written all over the walls.

01:47:55.160 --> 01:47:57.120
Used his own filth.

01:47:57.200 --> 01:48:00.760
- Made him self a kind of paint.
- Dear God.

01:48:02.040 --> 01:48:04.560
The stench !

01:48:08.200 --> 01:48:10.680
- Free his mouth.
- You mustn't do that, sir.

01:48:10.760 --> 01:48:15.440
I must grant him his last rites.
Give me your dagger.

01:48:15.480 --> 01:48:17.720
Leave us.

01:48:41.760 --> 01:48:45.520
Shh.

01:48:45.560 --> 01:48:49.240
I failed to save your soul in life.

01:48:49.320 --> 01:48:51.800
I won't fail in death.

01:48:53.800 --> 01:48:56.120
Dear Heavenly Father,

01:48:56.200 --> 01:48:58.840
prove Your infinite mercy...

01:48:58.920 --> 01:49:00.840
and open Your gates to this man,

01:49:00.920 --> 01:49:04.720
no less Your child than any other.

01:49:06.240 --> 01:49:09.040
There is...

01:49:09.080 --> 01:49:11.440
in each of us...

01:49:11.480 --> 01:49:13.400
such beauty...

01:49:13.440 --> 01:49:15.560
and such abomination.

01:49:15.640 --> 01:49:18.240
No man is exempt.

01:49:19.640 --> 01:49:22.480
Forgive him.

01:49:24.200 --> 01:49:27.480
Forgive us all.

01:49:29.720 --> 01:49:31.920
Kiss the cross.

01:49:35.800 --> 01:49:38.160
Marquis !

01:49:41.240 --> 01:49:43.120
Marquis !

01:49:58.360 --> 01:50:01.400
No !

01:50:11.320 --> 01:50:12.700
Welcome to Charenton, Abbé.

01:50:13.980 --> 01:50:15.120
I'm pleased to have
the new post, sir.

01:50:15.200 --> 01:50:18.360
Are you ? Thank you.

01:50:18.440 --> 01:50:21.400
I'm afraid our endowment
has shriveled to a mere pittance.

01:50:21.480 --> 01:50:24.600
We are the laughingstock
of all France.

01:50:24.680 --> 01:50:27.480
However, on a happier note,

01:50:27.560 --> 01:50:31.280
the hospital is now in my sole command.

01:50:31.360 --> 01:50:36.600
My policy here is that
each man must earn his keep.

01:50:36.680 --> 01:50:40.280
The Charenton Press, Abbé.

01:50:40.360 --> 01:50:44.920
We produce books for the
discriminating collector.

01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:49.080
The compulsive inmates
set the type.

01:50:52.960 --> 01:50:56.440
The listless ones do the binding
and prepare the ink.

01:50:56.520 --> 01:50:58.480
It's remarkable, Doctor.

01:50:58.560 --> 01:51:01.520
The patients are
so subdued, so docile.

01:51:01.600 --> 01:51:03.440
Yes, they are at peace.

01:51:03.520 --> 01:51:08.560
They have the satisfaction that only
a hard day's labor can provide.

01:51:10.080 --> 01:51:12.240
I don't believe it.

01:51:12.320 --> 01:51:16.080
The Marquis de Sade ? You're actually
publishing his novels ?

01:51:16.160 --> 01:51:19.280
Yes. Ever since
his unfortunate death,

01:51:19.360 --> 01:51:22.000
there's been a surge
of interest in his works.

01:51:22.080 --> 01:51:27.000
Of course, I will use the profits to
restore Charenton to its former glory.

01:51:27.080 --> 01:51:28.920
Oh, Doctor.

01:51:30.400 --> 01:51:32.840
We have a meeting
with Herr Becker at 4:00.

01:51:32.920 --> 01:51:34.880
He wants to publish
a Swiss edition...

01:51:34.960 --> 01:51:38.160
on gilded paper bound in calfskin.

01:51:38.240 --> 01:51:40.880
- Thank you, Charlotte.
- My pleasure.

01:51:40.960 --> 01:51:45.520
Have a look at page 205.
I turned the corner down.

01:51:59.920 --> 01:52:04.240
Come on, move.
On your left. Come on.

01:52:04.320 --> 01:52:07.360
Next one. Go on.
Get these books onboard.

01:52:07.440 --> 01:52:09.280
Come on! Those boxes over there !

01:52:09.360 --> 01:52:12.480
Move yourself. Right.

01:52:12.560 --> 01:52:16.640
Right, old mate, that's it !
See you next week !

01:52:16.720 --> 01:52:20.160
Of course, everything is not
quite as harmonious as it seems.

01:52:20.240 --> 01:52:22.720
I hope you have a strong constitution.

01:52:22.800 --> 01:52:27.480
My years tending lepers steeled me
for life's grisliest offerings.

01:52:27.600 --> 01:52:30.720
We still have a few lone incurables...

01:52:30.800 --> 01:52:34.240
prone to violence and perversion.

01:52:35.920 --> 01:52:37.920
So...

01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:40.320
you're my successor, yes ?

01:52:40.400 --> 01:52:42.240
Successor ?

01:52:43.400 --> 01:52:45.240
Oh.

01:52:46.960 --> 01:52:50.720
Listen to me... Abbé,

01:52:50.800 --> 01:52:52.920
and listen well.

01:52:54.880 --> 01:52:57.320
I've stared into the face of evil...

01:52:58.720 --> 01:53:01.720
and I've lived to tell the tale.

01:53:01.760 --> 01:53:05.560
Now, I beg you, for your sake,
let me write it down.

01:53:05.640 --> 01:53:08.080
Gibberish, my friend.
He rants and he raves.

01:53:08.160 --> 01:53:10.160
If you've an ounce of Christian charity,

01:53:10.240 --> 01:53:14.120
then you'll bring me parchment,
ink and a quill.

01:53:14.200 --> 01:53:19.520
You'll do no such thing. This patient
poses a grave danger to himself and others.

01:53:29.600 --> 01:53:31.960
Are you all right, sir ?

01:53:34.200 --> 01:53:39.800
Do you not see, Abbé ?

01:53:39.880 --> 01:53:43.640
Some men are beyond redemption.

01:53:44.800 --> 01:53:47.480
No. Wait. Please.

01:53:47.560 --> 01:53:50.240
Please bring mea quill. Please ?

01:53:50.320 --> 01:53:53.400
Wait. I'm sorry.

01:53:53.480 --> 01:53:57.320
Goddamn you, Abbé ! A quill !

01:54:04.760 --> 01:54:07.080
A quill.

01:54:23.320 --> 01:54:25.480
Use it well.

01:54:25.560 --> 01:54:28.200
You owe her that.

01:54:44.520 --> 01:54:46.600
Beloved reader,

01:54:46.680 --> 01:54:50.720
I leave you now with a tale
penned by the Abbé de Coulmier,

01:54:50.760 --> 01:54:55.160
a man who found freedom
in the unlikeliest of places -

01:54:55.240 --> 01:54:57.600
at the bottom of an inkwell,

01:54:57.640 --> 01:54:59.880
on the tip of a quill.

01:55:09.480 --> 01:55:11.680
However, be forewarned,

01:55:11.720 --> 01:55:14.200
its plot is blood-soaked,

01:55:14.240 --> 01:55:16.960
its characters depraved,

01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:21.400
and its themes... unwholesome at best.

01:55:21.480 --> 01:55:23.440
But in order to know virtue,

01:55:23.520 --> 01:55:26.720
we must acquaint ourselves
with vice.

01:55:26.760 --> 01:55:30.080
Only then can we know
the full measure of man.

01:55:31.720 --> 01:55:33.720
So come.

01:55:33.800 --> 01:55:36.160
I dare you.

01:55:36.200 --> 01:55:38.680
Turn the page.
