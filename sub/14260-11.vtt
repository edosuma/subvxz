Oh, man, what's taking
Michelangelo so long?

01:19.446 --> 01:20.879
I'm starving.

01:20.881 --> 01:22.781
Steady, Raphael.

01:22.783 --> 01:25.516
Remember, a ninja
is always patient.

01:28.087 --> 01:29.754
[Michelangelo]
Whoa, hang on, dudes.

01:29.756 --> 01:31.123
Here comes the cavalry,

01:31.125 --> 01:35.026
bringing marshmallow, octopus,
and chili pepper pizza.

01:35.028 --> 01:36.427
[Raphael]
All right!

01:36.429 --> 01:39.197
At last we can do
some serious deep-dishing.

01:39.199 --> 01:42.267
[Donatello]
Not so fast,
fellow pizza-lovers.

01:42.269 --> 01:43.968
This is a perfect
opportunity

01:43.970 --> 01:47.672
for me to demonstrate
my latest invention:

01:47.674 --> 01:50.508
the automatic pizza-slicer.

01:50.510 --> 01:53.645
Whoa, it looks more
like a pizza shredder.

01:53.647 --> 01:56.514
Face it, it just looks
like Shredder, period.

01:56.516 --> 01:59.150
It'll carve up those pizzas
in the blink of an eye.

01:59.152 --> 02:03.288
Uh, Donatello, are you sure
this is such a good idea?

02:03.290 --> 02:06.891
Hey, have you ever known
one of my inventions to fail?

02:08.693 --> 02:10.527
Uh, never mind,
don't answer that.

02:10.530 --> 02:11.896
[whirring]

02:14.900 --> 02:16.735
Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa!

02:21.240 --> 02:22.707
Turn it off!

02:26.412 --> 02:28.980
Uh, I'll--
I'll handle this.

02:32.351 --> 02:34.819
[machine turns off]

02:34.821 --> 02:36.354
Oh, no,

02:36.356 --> 02:38.156
that was my favorite bow.

02:38.158 --> 02:39.857
Nice going, boy genius.

02:39.859 --> 02:41.993
You just turned our lunch
into wallpaper.

02:41.995 --> 02:43.295
I think that machine of yours

02:43.297 --> 02:45.997
is a little over-engineered,
Donatello.

02:47.200 --> 02:49.900
Uh, gee, guys,
I'm really sorry.

02:49.902 --> 02:53.004
Well, dudes, looks like
we're heading up to Vinnie's.

02:53.006 --> 02:55.973
Yeah, for some
unshredded pizza.

03:08.454 --> 03:10.121
Donatello!

03:10.123 --> 03:11.689
What happened here?

03:11.691 --> 03:15.226
Gee, sensei, another one
of my inventions backfired.

03:15.228 --> 03:17.362
It's the third time
this week.

03:17.364 --> 03:20.665
The only way one learns
is by making mistakes.

03:20.667 --> 03:24.502
Although I admit this was
a particularly messy mistake.

03:24.504 --> 03:25.937
I don't know, sensei.

03:25.939 --> 03:28.139
I mean, I'm supposed
to be the brainy one,

03:28.141 --> 03:30.775
yet all I seem to do
lately is goof up.

03:30.777 --> 03:34.079
There is no dishonor
in failure, my student.

03:34.081 --> 03:37.382
You must learn
to turn your failures
into victories.

03:37.384 --> 03:40.051
I'd like to turn this thing
into scrap metal.

03:40.053 --> 03:41.886
Do not be hasty,
Donatello.

03:41.888 --> 03:43.455
Before this day is over,

03:43.457 --> 03:46.724
you may yet understand
the meaning of what
I have told you.

03:56.535 --> 03:59.637
Hoo, what a job,
cleaning up that mess.

03:59.639 --> 04:02.640
I deserve to watch
a little TV.

04:02.642 --> 04:04.775

04:20.293 --> 04:23.361
All right! Score one
for the good guys!

04:23.363 --> 04:24.595
[Vernon]
Not only will it protect

04:24.597 --> 04:27.532
numerous endangered species
of our turtle friends,

04:27.534 --> 04:29.668
but it will help

04:29.670 --> 04:32.403

Dirty, smelly reptiles, huh?

04:49.456 --> 04:52.090
Why, that overblown
windbag!

04:52.092 --> 04:54.458
He can't talk that way
about our species!

04:54.460 --> 04:56.027
I'm going down to Channel 6

04:56.029 --> 04:59.264
and give that Vernon
a piece of my green mind!

04:59.266 --> 05:02.500
<i>This is April O'Neil</i>

05:02.502 --> 05:05.370

<i>the appearance</i>

05:16.883 --> 05:19.584
<i>of a large, vicious turtle!</i>

05:19.586 --> 05:23.154
A large, vicious turtle
flying a spaceship?

05:23.156 --> 05:26.391
That almost sounds
like-- like Slash,

05:26.393 --> 05:28.760
the evil turtle
from Dimension X.

05:28.762 --> 05:29.994
Nah, couldn't be.

05:29.996 --> 05:32.330
That Slash character
was as dumb as mud.

05:39.204 --> 05:42.240
That UFO must have landed
around here somewhere.

05:42.242 --> 05:45.142
[chatter]

05:45.144 --> 05:48.513
"Police barricade--
do not pass."

05:48.515 --> 05:50.648
Aw, that just means humans.

05:55.521 --> 05:58.055
Oh, no. I don't believe it!

05:58.057 --> 05:59.590
It's the Space Scow.

05:59.592 --> 06:02.927
That's the ship Slash
made his getaway in
the last time we met!

06:02.929 --> 06:05.129
He really must be back.

06:05.131 --> 06:07.598
[crash]
Uh-oh. Trouble!

06:15.507 --> 06:17.142
All right, Slash!

06:17.144 --> 06:19.444
[rustling]

06:19.446 --> 06:21.746
[growling]

06:21.748 --> 06:23.314
Binky.

06:23.316 --> 06:26.217
Why would a rock-stupid
shellback like you

06:26.219 --> 06:29.086
be interested
in complicated electronic
gear like this?

06:29.088 --> 06:30.788
My dear fellow,

06:30.790 --> 06:34.492
I needed to complete
my Trans-Frequency
Flux Oscillator.

06:34.494 --> 06:36.827
And you, I'm afraid,
are in my way.

06:39.732 --> 06:42.099
Whoa!

06:42.101 --> 06:44.235
Whatever happened
to the old, lovable,

06:44.237 --> 06:46.704
stupid-as-a-sea-slug Slash?

06:46.706 --> 06:48.640
No use trying to hide,
old chap.

06:48.642 --> 06:50.441
Your meager wits
don't stand a chance

06:50.443 --> 06:52.644
against my super-intelligence.

06:52.646 --> 06:54.979
Well, you may now be
some kind of a brainiac,

06:54.981 --> 06:57.615
but-- but are your muscles
still in shape?

06:57.617 --> 06:59.349
Yaah!
[growling]

06:59.351 --> 07:02.353
Argh! Whoa!

07:02.355 --> 07:05.089
Well, I guess
that answers that.

07:05.091 --> 07:07.458
I've both brains and brawn,
my dear fellow.

07:07.460 --> 07:10.695
If I've calculated
the trigonometric angles
correctly,

07:10.697 --> 07:12.096
you're about to be squashed.

07:23.909 --> 07:25.509
Whoa!

07:27.446 --> 07:30.114
Now, I'm afraid, we must
end this little soirée.

07:30.116 --> 07:31.649
I have much work to do.

07:31.651 --> 07:34.552
Well, he's still
as mean as ever.

07:37.423 --> 07:39.557
Oh, some things never change.

07:44.629 --> 07:47.131
They sure don't build cars
like they used to.

07:49.101 --> 07:52.403
I intend to be
the supreme turtle
in this town.

07:52.405 --> 07:55.272

Whoa!

07:55.274 --> 07:56.708
20 to the power of 9

07:56.710 --> 07:58.676
plus a factor of 5
across stress

07:58.678 --> 08:00.011
plus minus 12 of gravity.

08:00.013 --> 08:02.780
[high-pitched sound]

08:02.782 --> 08:04.148
[rumbling]

Whoa!

08:05.284 --> 08:06.116
Uh-oh.

08:07.986 --> 08:10.922
I knew I should have
worn a hard hat.

08:13.892 --> 08:15.326
Uh-oh.

08:19.698 --> 08:23.567
Oh, wouldn't you know it,
and I just had my shell waxed!

08:23.569 --> 08:25.403
One down
and three to go.

08:25.405 --> 08:28.205
Now, on to Channel 6
for the equipment I'll need

08:28.207 --> 08:30.975
to complete
my Trans-Frequency
Flux Oscillator.

08:30.977 --> 08:33.544
[Leonardo]
Where could Donatello
have disappeared to?

08:33.546 --> 08:36.214
[sighing]
I'll try and reach him
on the TurtleCom.

08:36.216 --> 08:38.682
Donatello, where are you?

08:38.683 --> 08:40.717
[Donatello]
Uh, under a pile
of girders,

08:40.720 --> 08:42.352
somewhere in
the mid-town area.

08:42.354 --> 08:43.554
<i>[Leonardo]</i>
<i>Do you need help?</i>

08:43.556 --> 08:46.257
Does Michelangelo
like pizza?

08:51.697 --> 08:54.398
Now to make certain
no one gets out or in.

09:02.241 --> 09:04.308
Whom do you wish
to see, sir?

09:04.310 --> 09:06.644
Your broadcasting antenna
on the roof.

09:06.646 --> 09:08.746
I'm sorry,
but that's impossible.

09:08.748 --> 09:10.681
[chuckling]
Nothing is impossible

09:10.683 --> 09:13.917
to someone with an
anti-gravitational beam.

09:13.919 --> 09:15.620
Aah!

09:17.990 --> 09:21.092
Hey, buster, you can't
come up here without a pass.

09:21.094 --> 09:23.728
[Slash]
I don't need
no stinking pass.

09:23.730 --> 09:26.430
My own invention,
an immobilizer ray.

09:28.534 --> 09:30.735
Hey, you're not
allowed back here!

09:30.737 --> 09:33.504
As they express it so crudely
on your primitive planet,

09:33.506 --> 09:35.339
chill out.

09:35.341 --> 09:37.909
Aah!
Aah!

09:39.545 --> 09:41.044
Are you in there,
Donatello?

09:41.046 --> 09:43.614
[Donatello]
What's left of me.

09:43.616 --> 09:45.049
Whoa, dude.

09:45.051 --> 09:48.286
Looks like somebody
got the drop on you
big time!

09:48.288 --> 09:52.056
Yeah. Hard to believe
it was Slash!

09:52.058 --> 09:53.524
Slash?

09:53.526 --> 09:55.493
You're dissin' us,
right dude?

09:55.495 --> 09:57.695
You were beaten
by the dumbest turtle

09:57.697 --> 09:59.630
this side
of Moe's Pet Shop?

09:59.632 --> 10:03.167
Somehow he's turned
into a super-genius.

10:03.169 --> 10:04.568
All right.

10:04.570 --> 10:06.471
Yeah, sure, right.

10:06.473 --> 10:08.472
Hey, he said he was
going to Channel 6.

10:08.474 --> 10:10.074
You can see for yourselves.

10:13.612 --> 10:15.213
[beeping]

10:15.215 --> 10:16.914
[Chief]
Up and at 'em, Vernon.

10:16.916 --> 10:19.683
The story of the century
is right under our noses.

10:19.685 --> 10:21.986
Uh, what story
is that, Chief?

10:21.988 --> 10:24.488
Some kind of alien turtle
is on the loose!

10:24.490 --> 10:26.991
[scoffs]
Not another turtle!

10:26.993 --> 10:29.293
I've done enough turtle
stories for one day.

10:29.295 --> 10:32.029
From the looks of it,
he's out to conquer the world,

10:32.031 --> 10:33.731
starting with Channel 6!

10:33.733 --> 10:36.567
What? He's here?
In the building?

10:36.569 --> 10:37.869
Yes,

10:37.871 --> 10:40.604
and we're going to get
the exclusive story.

10:41.840 --> 10:43.207
There it is!

10:43.209 --> 10:45.576
[Michelangelo]
Whoa, why is
the Channel 6 building

10:45.578 --> 10:47.644
glowing like that?
[Donatello]
You'll see.

10:47.646 --> 10:49.147
[zapping]
[all]
Oh, ouch!

10:49.149 --> 10:50.814
What was that?

10:50.816 --> 10:53.017
Our dumb as a brick friend

10:53.019 --> 10:54.852
has used
his super-intelligence

10:54.854 --> 10:57.454
to create an impenetrable
force field!

10:57.456 --> 10:59.557
It only goes halfway
up the building.

10:59.559 --> 11:01.124
Maybe we could
climb over it.

11:03.595 --> 11:05.829
Yeah, it's worth a try.

11:07.399 --> 11:08.366
Bingo!

11:08.368 --> 11:11.168
We next add 1 pound sugar,

11:11.170 --> 11:12.936
a shake of nutmeg,

11:12.938 --> 11:14.405
3 cups of lard,

11:14.407 --> 11:16.173
and a quart of chicken fat,

11:16.175 --> 11:17.842
and bring it all to a boil.

11:17.844 --> 11:18.876
Then we--

11:20.946 --> 11:24.248
Eeh! Run for your lives!

11:25.383 --> 11:27.118
Ha ha ha ha!

11:27.120 --> 11:28.452
These ridiculous earthlings.

11:28.454 --> 11:31.122
It takes so little
to send them into a panic.

11:31.124 --> 11:33.390
Soon, thanks to my
intellectual genius,

11:33.392 --> 11:36.093
this entire city
will be turtlized!

11:36.095 --> 11:39.129
[Slash]
There will be turtle
cooking shows...

11:40.232 --> 11:43.300
And next, you add
3 cups of turtle food,

11:43.302 --> 11:45.603
then 5 cups
of turtle food,

11:45.605 --> 11:48.873
then a dozen more
cups of turtle food.

11:49.908 --> 11:51.709
[Slash]
Turtle news shows...

11:51.711 --> 11:53.344
Disaster was averted today

11:53.346 --> 11:55.747
when the turtle police
rescued three citizens

11:55.749 --> 11:59.417
who had accidentally
rolled over onto their backs.

12:00.618 --> 12:02.920
[Slash]
Turtle home shopping
channels.

12:02.922 --> 12:04.455
Folks, I got to tell you,

12:04.457 --> 12:07.124
these plastic palm trees are
going like hotcakes-- ouch!

12:07.126 --> 12:07.992
So call in now.

12:09.528 --> 12:11.662
[Slash]
Even a turtle
weather channel.

12:11.664 --> 12:13.397
Weatherwise, it looks
like it's gonna be

12:13.399 --> 12:15.332
an absolutely perfect day

12:15.334 --> 12:17.201
for sunning yourself
out on a rock.

12:17.203 --> 12:19.370
And I shall be...

12:19.372 --> 12:21.606
the turtle supreme!

12:21.608 --> 12:24.308
From here, you look more
like a turkey supreme!

12:24.310 --> 12:27.044
Okay, Slash,
your time is up.

12:27.046 --> 12:29.213
Ah, my earthling enemies.

12:29.215 --> 12:31.381
You've arrived
precisely on schedule.

12:31.383 --> 12:33.684
I calculated it
to the nanosecond.

12:33.686 --> 12:34.585
[all]
Huh?

12:34.587 --> 12:37.955
Guys, I told you.
He's changed.

12:37.957 --> 12:40.391
Okay, so he
sounds smart.

12:40.393 --> 12:42.159
But is he really smart?

12:42.161 --> 12:44.895
Smart enough to have
invented this little gadget.

12:49.067 --> 12:50.168
Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa!

12:50.170 --> 12:51.535
Look out!

12:53.705 --> 12:55.206
I'm beginning
to see the light.

12:55.208 --> 12:58.275
And now I shall
destroy you utterly.

12:58.277 --> 12:59.843
Whoa, now, whoa, whoa
time out. Easy, easy.

12:59.845 --> 13:01.478
Let's, uh,
let's discuss this.

13:01.480 --> 13:04.015
Well, now that I have
such an incredible vocabulary,

13:04.017 --> 13:06.184
discussing things
is my strong point.

13:06.186 --> 13:07.618
Then answer us this.

13:07.620 --> 13:09.954
How did you get so smart
all of a sudden?

13:09.956 --> 13:12.556
I was wondering when
someone would ask me that.

13:12.558 --> 13:15.392
It happened while I was
drifting through space...

13:16.828 --> 13:19.129
which was entirely
your doing, I might add.

13:19.131 --> 13:22.132
[Michelangelo]
Yeah, I remember,
episode 74.

13:22.134 --> 13:23.067
[Slash]
At any rate,

13:23.069 --> 13:25.602
I happened to crash land
on this alien world...

13:28.439 --> 13:29.873
which turned out
to be inhabited

13:29.875 --> 13:32.443
by a race of
hyper-intelligent beings.

13:32.445 --> 13:35.579
Seeing that I was something
of a...underachiever--

13:35.581 --> 13:36.781
[Raphael]
Try no-brainer.

13:36.783 --> 13:39.450
They took pity on me,
and increased my intelligence

13:39.452 --> 13:42.253
beyond the wildest dreams
of mere mortals,

13:42.255 --> 13:43.854
or even turtles.

13:46.324 --> 13:47.625
From that moment on,

13:47.627 --> 13:50.094
I became a turtle
with a mission...

13:51.796 --> 13:55.566
to return to Earth
and become the number 1
supreme turtle

13:55.568 --> 13:58.769
by turtlizing
the entire planet.

13:58.771 --> 14:01.038
And just how do you
plan to do that?

14:01.040 --> 14:02.540
By using my animalizer ray

14:02.542 --> 14:05.476
to turn every single
human being on Earth
into a turtle.

14:05.478 --> 14:07.011
No way, dude.

14:07.013 --> 14:09.880
There's no such thing
as an animalizer ray.

14:09.882 --> 14:13.617
That's why I used my
super-intelligence genius
to invent one.

14:13.619 --> 14:16.621
There's that creature.
Get some footage of him.

14:16.623 --> 14:18.155
Me?

14:18.157 --> 14:20.391
[gulping]
What if he attacks me?

14:20.393 --> 14:22.326
I can dream, can't I?

14:22.328 --> 14:24.795
[door thumps]
Ah, two ideal subjects.

14:27.466 --> 14:30.367
Huh? What's happening?

14:30.369 --> 14:33.638
I knew I should have
called in sick today!

14:33.640 --> 14:34.771
Chief!

14:34.773 --> 14:36.974
You-- You're a turtle.

14:36.976 --> 14:40.077
Well, have you
taken a good look
at yourself lately?

14:40.079 --> 14:41.912
I don't believe it.

14:41.914 --> 14:45.082
That animalizer gadget
actually works.

14:45.084 --> 14:47.218
I've had enough
of you, Slash.

14:47.220 --> 14:48.419
You're giving
a bad name

14:48.421 --> 14:50.687
to law-abiding
turtles everywhere!

14:51.957 --> 14:54.991
And Slash fights
with brain power.

14:54.993 --> 14:57.061
[all]
Whoa!

14:58.997 --> 15:00.697
I think I liked
that guy better

15:00.699 --> 15:02.332
when he was
a blithering idiot.

15:02.334 --> 15:05.636
Now, let's examine
the situation logically.

15:05.638 --> 15:08.973
Since I can't be supreme turtle
with you four around,

15:08.975 --> 15:10.975
I'll
just have to put you on ice.

15:10.977 --> 15:14.712
And the weatherman
said it would be sunny
and m-m-m-mild today!

15:14.714 --> 15:16.580
Oh!

15:21.052 --> 15:23.654
Sorry to give you
the cold shoulder,

15:23.656 --> 15:25.923
but I've got a world
to turtlize.

15:30.429 --> 15:33.931
And I'll take my first two
loyal subjects with me.

15:33.933 --> 15:36.567
Uh, w-whatever
you say, boss.

15:36.569 --> 15:38.769
Hey, hey, hey!
I'm your boss.

15:38.771 --> 15:41.038
Maybe so, but he's
bigger than you are.

15:47.779 --> 15:51.048
Ah, the new
ultra-heterodyne antenna,

15:51.050 --> 15:53.984
Just what I need to complete
my Trans-Frequency
Flux Oscillator,

15:53.986 --> 15:57.755
and turn everyone in the city
into my turtle minions.

15:57.757 --> 15:58.989
If I didn't know better,

15:58.991 --> 16:01.459
I'd say he's bent
on world domination.

16:01.461 --> 16:03.193
He's bent all right,

16:03.195 --> 16:05.329
especially in the area
of the brain.

16:05.331 --> 16:07.364
Reverse polarity
of the flux indicators,

16:07.366 --> 16:11.835
bridges passages
at the audion sequencer
transmismodifier...

16:11.837 --> 16:15.539
Phew, being a genius
is certainly hard on
my neuron endings.

16:15.541 --> 16:17.374
Where'd everybody go?

16:17.376 --> 16:19.676
[gasping]
Guys!

16:21.212 --> 16:23.647
What happened?
Who did this to you?

16:23.649 --> 16:25.849
Mmm!
Oh, sorry.

16:25.851 --> 16:27.718
I didn't realize
you can't talk.

16:27.720 --> 16:29.453
I'll get you
out of there somehow.

16:29.455 --> 16:32.123
Just keep cool.

16:36.495 --> 16:38.262
[Vernon]
We've got to get
out of here

16:38.264 --> 16:39.396
and warn the world.

16:39.398 --> 16:41.032
Maybe we can
tip this box over.

16:41.034 --> 16:44.068
Good thinking.
You push, I'll supervise.

16:44.070 --> 16:46.570
Oh, come on, Chief,
give me a hand.

16:46.572 --> 16:48.205
I-I mean, flipper.

16:48.207 --> 16:50.574
Ooh, all right.

16:53.678 --> 16:55.445
[both grunting]

16:55.447 --> 16:58.015
We did it!
Let's get
to that stairway.

16:58.017 --> 16:59.116
Hurry!

16:59.118 --> 17:02.052
Hurry? I'm a turtle,
remember?

17:03.754 --> 17:05.489
Hang on, guys,

17:05.491 --> 17:06.624
I'll get you thawed out.

17:09.060 --> 17:11.328
I have a feeling we're
not going to make it.

17:11.329 --> 17:14.799
Don't be ridiculous.
Of course we will.

17:14.800 --> 17:16.733
You go first.

17:18.303 --> 17:21.538
[both]
Ooh, ooh, ow!

17:23.907 --> 17:25.075
Oh, Chief,

17:25.077 --> 17:27.411
I've fallen
and I can't get up!

17:27.413 --> 17:30.381
All right, Vernon,
don't get your shell
bent out of shape.

17:30.383 --> 17:33.383
Come on, we've got
to get help.

17:33.385 --> 17:35.286
Almost there.

17:35.288 --> 17:37.488
Ooh, thanks, April.

17:37.490 --> 17:39.457
You're a warm
and wonderful human being.

17:39.459 --> 17:41.992
Hey, after all those times
you've rescued me,

17:41.994 --> 17:43.760
it was the least I could do.

17:43.762 --> 17:46.463
Now we've got to find out
where Slash has gone.

17:46.465 --> 17:47.665
He's on the roof!

17:47.667 --> 17:51.168
Chief? Vernon?
Is that you?

17:51.170 --> 17:53.571
Why, you're...
talking turtles!

17:53.573 --> 17:55.639
That turtle freak
friend of yours

17:55.641 --> 17:58.275
is doing something
to the station's
new antenna.

17:58.277 --> 17:59.476
You've
got to stop him.

17:59.478 --> 18:01.378
That thing
cost me a fortune.

18:01.380 --> 18:04.781
I wonder what Slash wants
with a broadcasting antenna.

18:04.783 --> 18:06.249
I've got it.

18:06.251 --> 18:09.219
Slash can't turn everyone
in the city into a turtle

18:09.221 --> 18:11.722
with that little handheld
animalizer ray of his,

18:11.724 --> 18:14.158
so he's going
to amplify its power

18:14.160 --> 18:15.759
with the station's
antenna.

18:15.761 --> 18:17.995
Come on, then.
We've got to stop him.

18:17.997 --> 18:19.196
Wait!

18:19.198 --> 18:21.131
You're not going
to leave us here,
are you?

18:21.133 --> 18:23.067
You've got to
return us to normal.

18:23.069 --> 18:27.104
You know, Vernon,
after the rotten things
you said about turtles,

18:27.106 --> 18:29.206
we should just
leave you that way.

18:29.208 --> 18:31.775
Oh, oh, p-please.
I'm sorry.

18:31.777 --> 18:32.909
I take back everything

18:32.911 --> 18:34.778
I've ever said to anyone
about anything!

18:34.780 --> 18:37.480
Oh, all right.

18:43.354 --> 18:45.255
There. It's finished!

18:46.591 --> 18:48.959
And so are you,
Slash!

18:48.961 --> 18:51.228
<i>Arrivederci!</i>

18:51.230 --> 18:52.896
<i>Bonjour!</i>

18:52.898 --> 18:53.830
<i>Adios!</i>

18:53.832 --> 18:55.832
And <i> sayonara!</i>

18:55.834 --> 18:57.868
Man, what a show-off.

18:57.870 --> 19:01.105
The dude makes an exit
in four different languages.

19:01.107 --> 19:02.540
Look where he's heading.

19:02.542 --> 19:04.774
[Leonardo]
The Trumpet Tower
apartment building.

19:04.776 --> 19:06.543
The tallest structure
in the city.

19:06.545 --> 19:09.312
Sure, he wants to get
the maximum range

19:09.314 --> 19:12.316
out of his
animalizer ray.

19:12.318 --> 19:13.883
[Vernon]
Oh, where are we going?

19:13.885 --> 19:15.919
I've got to get something
from the lair.

19:15.921 --> 19:19.122
But what about us?
You've got to get us
back to normal.

19:19.124 --> 19:22.126
Keep your shell on, Vernon,
I'll get you fixed up.

19:24.629 --> 19:26.463
There. It's ready.

19:26.465 --> 19:30.066
Now to turtlize
this entire city.

19:30.068 --> 19:33.237
You're the one who's gonna
get turtlized, Slash!

19:33.239 --> 19:35.872
By the Teenage Mutant
Ninja Turtles.

19:37.642 --> 19:39.510
I suppose you consider that
some sort of honor?

19:39.512 --> 19:40.743
[beeps]

19:41.947 --> 19:43.246
[Leonardo]
All right, fellas,

19:43.248 --> 19:44.815
let's take him!

19:48.486 --> 19:49.786
Whoa, hot stuff!

19:49.788 --> 19:51.589
Whoo, cool it, already.

19:51.591 --> 19:54.892
En garde, you hunk of junk!

19:54.894 --> 19:55.992
Touchy, touchy.

19:58.396 --> 20:00.397
Farewell, you ignoramuses--

20:00.399 --> 20:01.932
or to be more
grammatically correct,

20:01.934 --> 20:03.334
ignoramusi.

20:03.336 --> 20:05.202
[door opening]
Farewell, yourself!

20:07.138 --> 20:08.439
Donatello!

20:08.441 --> 20:11.108
All right, you've come
to rescue us!

20:11.110 --> 20:13.610
I brought this
to dismantle the antenna,

20:13.612 --> 20:15.779
but I've got
a better use for it.

20:15.781 --> 20:18.014
We're about to go
bungee jumping
without a rope,

20:18.016 --> 20:20.850
and you bring your dumbest
invention of all time?

20:20.852 --> 20:23.487
[Donatello]
Hey, I'm just following
Master Splinter's advice

20:23.489 --> 20:26.056
and turning a failure
into a victory.

20:31.596 --> 20:33.664
[beeping]

20:33.666 --> 20:35.098
[Raphael]
Well, what do you know.

20:35.100 --> 20:37.601
That pizza-slicer was good
for something after all.

20:37.603 --> 20:39.869
You might have saved
your shells for the moment,

20:39.871 --> 20:42.739
but you can't stop me
from turtlizing this city.

20:42.741 --> 20:44.674
You know, Slash,
you think you're so smart,

20:44.676 --> 20:46.910
but you're actually
pretty stupid.

20:46.912 --> 20:50.280
Exactly what did you mean
by that disparaging remark?

20:50.282 --> 20:53.183
You never thought of using
your animalizer ray on us.

20:53.185 --> 20:56.720
You could set that thing
to change us into humans,

20:56.722 --> 20:59.923
and then you'd be
the only mutant turtle
in town.

20:59.925 --> 21:02.593
Hm, a most intelligent plan.

21:02.595 --> 21:04.394
I'm surprised I didn't
think of it myself.

21:08.066 --> 21:10.333
[Donatello]
It's just what
I was hoping.

21:11.602 --> 21:15.139
Oh, I'm human again!
I'm normal.

21:15.141 --> 21:18.508
Human, yes. Normal?
No, no, no, no, no.

21:18.510 --> 21:19.643
You tricked me!

21:19.645 --> 21:21.679
And here comes the treat!

21:26.084 --> 21:27.684
[grunting]

21:28.653 --> 21:30.988
You've destroyed
my animalizer.

21:30.990 --> 21:33.089
And now, I'll destroy you!

21:33.091 --> 21:35.159
Annihilate, decimate,

21:35.161 --> 21:37.694
demolish, pulverize!

21:37.696 --> 21:39.163
[Raphael]
I think we get the idea.

21:39.165 --> 21:42.932
Aah!
Aah!
Aah!

21:42.934 --> 21:45.102
Hang on, compadres!

21:47.905 --> 21:51.108
Cowabunga!

21:51.110 --> 21:53.810
Phew, everybody okay?

21:53.812 --> 21:57.448
We're all fine,
but what about Slash?

21:57.450 --> 21:58.915
[rumbling]

22:02.753 --> 22:05.555
Come on, dude, upsy-daisy.

22:05.557 --> 22:07.090
[chuckling]
Duh, hey.

22:07.092 --> 22:10.760
Tell me again
about the turtles, George.

22:10.762 --> 22:11.728
I think
that crash landing

22:11.730 --> 22:14.764
made him his old
stupid self again.

22:14.766 --> 22:15.999
Come on, Slash.

22:16.001 --> 22:18.468
We're gonna take you
back to your spaceship.

22:18.470 --> 22:23.073
Oh, goodie. I like
riding in spaceships.

22:23.075 --> 22:25.408
[Leonardo]
I've got to hand it
to Donatello.

22:25.410 --> 22:29.079
He outsmarted Slash
and his alien
super-intelligence.

22:29.081 --> 22:31.715
Yeah, but there's
just one thing
that's bugging me.

22:31.717 --> 22:33.116
Nothing blew up.

22:33.118 --> 22:34.384
And this bugs you?

22:34.386 --> 22:36.853
Well, you know
how when we defeat
the bad guys,

22:36.855 --> 22:39.956
there's always,
like, this big,
humongous explosion?

22:39.958 --> 22:41.358
Yeah? So?

22:41.360 --> 22:45.229
Well, so we defeated Slash,
but nothing blew up.

22:45.231 --> 22:46.630
Ahem.

22:46.632 --> 22:50.000
Since I am once again
the inventive genius
of this group,

22:50.002 --> 22:51.768
Here's my latest
creation:

22:51.770 --> 22:54.571
the automatic
cheese grater!

22:54.573 --> 22:56.807
[groaning]
See, you put
the parmesan here,

22:56.809 --> 22:58.642
and presto!

22:58.644 --> 23:00.611
[explosion]

23:02.380 --> 23:03.580
You happy now?

23:03.582 --> 23:06.483
When am I gonna learn
to keep my big beak shut?
