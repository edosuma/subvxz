'Why is light given to those in misery

00:40.392 --> 00:42.756
'and life to the bitter of soul?

00:45.811 --> 00:49.025
'To those who long for death that does not come?

00:49.724 --> 00:52.448
'Who search for it more than for hidden treasure?

01:03.574 --> 01:05.881
'Who are filled with gladness

01:05.903 --> 01:07.688
'and rejoice when they reach the grave?

01:20.099 --> 01:22.586
'For sighing comes to me instead of food.

01:23.598 --> 01:26.183
'My groans pour out like water.

01:57.548 --> 02:00.008
'What I feared has come upon me

02:00.918 --> 02:03.290
'what I dreaded has happened to me.

02:04.790 --> 02:06.383
'I have no peace, no quietness,

02:07.251 --> 02:08.704
'I have no rest, but only turmoil.'

02:09.247 --> 02:12.412
Faithlessness is the only natural disaster.

02:15.905 --> 02:18.832
Sugar is evil. Cast away that pop!

02:18.875 --> 02:20.550
Safe haven, right?
That's what you said.

02:21.608 --> 02:23.940
Well, I left my baby here, and now I want him back!

02:24.808 --> 02:28.311
You call this a safe haven?!
Dr Lockhart, Purdy can't sleep.

02:28.337 --> 02:29.882
Give me my baby!

02:29.918 --> 02:33.233
Ok, I'll be with you in a minute, Mrs Gaines.
Thank you, doctor.

02:33.298 --> 02:36.641
How much longer I got to wait?
Come on, sir, I'm taking you in.

02:40.178 --> 02:42.583
Paul Traylor, 34.
GSW to the chest.

02:42.615 --> 02:45.800
Shot by an intruder in his apartment.
Ok, I'm Dr Lockhart.

02:46.236 --> 02:48.521
Some dumb kids. Made a mistake.

02:48.638 --> 02:51.183
Tachy at 120, BP's good.
Wait. Hold up, hold up, hold up.

02:51.216 --> 02:53.242
Sats down to 89.
It's getting harder to breathe.

02:53.306 --> 02:55.122
Ok. Hemostat.
What?

02:55.136 --> 02:58.580
Just give me the clamp, quick now.
Repent sin, lest ye be stricken.

02:58.605 --> 03:00.991
What are you doing?

03:01.005 --> 03:03.603
Reidy, you gotta know that covering a penetrating chest wound

03:03.635 --> 03:09.281
creates a one-way valve causing a tension pneumo.

03:09.625 --> 03:11.710
Then the reckoning will commence!

03:11.806 --> 03:13.032
Thanks.
No problem.

03:13.077 --> 03:15.201
Welcome to the end of the world.

03:15.256 --> 03:18.543
Today... everything changes!

03:19.585 --> 03:21.673
Today? Really?
I thought that was next week.

03:29.895 --> 03:32.330
On my count.
One, two, three.

03:32.527 --> 03:35.252
Can you call St David's Academy?
No exit wound on the back.

03:35.275 --> 03:37.010
Tell them I won't be coming in?
We'll get on it.

03:37.065 --> 03:38.810
Nothing below the waist.
What do you do?

03:38.838 --> 03:40.813
Tutor and run the sports program.

03:40.835 --> 03:43.222
Axilla's clear.
Ok. Get him back down.

03:43.278 --> 03:45.312
Gates, you get started on the chest tube.
All right, boss.

03:45.335 --> 03:48.533
Haleh, can you call for c-spine, chest and belly films?

03:48.602 --> 03:49.134
Uh-huh.
I'll do that.

03:49.316 --> 03:52.152
No, you're supposed to let me do the grunt work while you supervise.

03:52.176 --> 03:54.352
Oh, that's true.
So, how did this happen?

03:54.405 --> 03:56.473
Stayed at my girlfriend's last night.

03:56.606 --> 03:58.591
When I got back, a bunch of kids were there.

03:58.615 --> 04:01.401
In your place?
They were partying or something.

04:01.508 --> 04:03.993
Told them to leave. Things got out of hand.

04:04.415 --> 04:06.492
One of them had a gun.
How'd they get in?

04:06.506 --> 04:09.023
I don't know.
All right, a little pinch.

04:09.466 --> 04:12.472
So, does being the attending feel different?
No, not really.

04:13.888 --> 04:15.311
Yeah, a little bit.

04:15.705 --> 04:19.233
Sorry, guys. I got hung up with the intussusception kid. What do you got?

04:19.366 --> 04:22.331
GSW to the chest, no exit.
BP and sats are good.

04:22.376 --> 04:24.410
All right, slight pressure here.

04:26.167 --> 04:29.552
200cc's on the floor.
That's my blood?

04:29.576 --> 04:31.383
That's pretty normal
for a gunshot wound.

04:31.435 --> 04:33.601
Type and cross for six.
Morris, excuse me.

04:33.638 --> 04:36.222
We have an attending here.
Right. Of course.

04:36.356 --> 04:39.503
I told them family only, but they wouldn't take no for an answer.

04:40.026 --> 04:42.230
Coach, you ok?
How'd this happen?

04:42.895 --> 04:44.793
Thanks for showing up, guys.

04:45.117 --> 04:48.730
You got morning drills and school.
We ain't practicing without you.

04:48.775 --> 04:50.602
Call me when
you get the films back.

04:50.678 --> 04:51.823
Excuse me.

04:55.596 --> 04:56.830
You ok?

04:57.315 --> 04:59.292
Had a run of double shifts.

04:59.527 --> 05:02.320
Oh, why don't you take a couple days off?
He won't stop working.

05:02.377 --> 05:05.201
Yeah, the interns are all in procedure lab,

05:05.215 --> 05:07.300
and we're already stretched thin without Greg.

05:09.266 --> 05:11.742
Have you met the new,uh, chief yet...

05:12.165 --> 05:13.603
Banfield? No, not yet.

05:13.618 --> 05:15.260
Soon enough.
She's on today.

05:15.315 --> 05:17.842
Dr Morris, I got two kids here with possible gastro.

05:17.878 --> 05:19.770
I'll take it. Why don't you take a break?

05:21.255 --> 05:24.061
This is Mrs Weddington with her sons, Larry and Curly.

05:24.427 --> 05:25.713
Oh. Where's Mo?

05:30.905 --> 05:33.890
No Mo. Ok. Uh... Larry?

05:34.465 --> 05:37.231
That's Curly.
Right. Right.

05:37.298 --> 05:40.490
They were up all night vomiting,
but they seem to be better now.

05:40.718 --> 05:42.250
Probably had too much cake.

05:42.307 --> 05:44.371
We were at a bowling party all day yesterday.

05:44.665 --> 05:47.652
Sam, I thought you went upstairs.
Ah, they said it might

05:47.676 --> 05:49.190
take a while, so I might as well work.

05:50.376 --> 05:53.341
They're making her go in front of some stupid
disciplinary board.

05:53.437 --> 05:56.542
How come?
She left a heplock in a patient.

05:56.616 --> 05:58.610
Ok, why don't we fluid-challenge these guys?

05:58.638 --> 06:00.341
Give them some popsicles, see how they do.

06:00.566 --> 06:03.512
Oh, excuse me? Um, I was wondering, um...

06:08.188 --> 06:11.423
My boys are getting to the age where they need to know

06:11.478 --> 06:14.821
about certain things, and I'm sure they have questions...

06:16.067 --> 06:17.522
Oh, sex.

06:18.025 --> 06:19.101
Drugs.

06:19.746 --> 06:21.030
Rock and roll.

06:21.526 --> 06:23.462
Yeah. Could you maybe talk to them?

06:25.805 --> 06:28.863
Uh... yeah, sure.
Oh, great. Thank you so much.

06:28.905 --> 06:30.802
Sure. I'll be back here in a little while.
Ok.

06:30.836 --> 06:33.513
I'll just... I'll catch up with them.
Great. Ok.

06:39.007 --> 06:40.371
You look pretty.

06:41.148 --> 06:42.782
Are you stoned?

06:44.105 --> 06:47.193
So, I just, uh, heard a rumor.
Is it true?

06:48.026 --> 06:49.561
This kid's here to see his coach.

06:49.876 --> 06:51.111
Yeah. He's, uh...

06:51.305 --> 06:52.611
he's right through there.

06:52.868 --> 06:54.830
Some of your friends are already with him.

06:59.048 --> 07:00.550
What's the rumor?

07:01.286 --> 07:03.782
You got a job at Mass General.

07:03.827 --> 07:05.872
That you're moving to Boston.

07:08.016 --> 07:09.270
Who told you that?

07:10.068 --> 07:12.531
Girl who works in HR told a scrub nurse.

07:12.577 --> 07:17.003
Oh, really? Is this the same girl that said that
Chuny was pregnant with Crenshaw's love child?

07:18.815 --> 07:20.551
I'm happy for you.

07:20.638 --> 07:24.282
I really am. I'm happy for you and Luka and Joe,

07:25.138 --> 07:29.131
even if it kills me to think that you
won't be working here anymore.

07:29.276 --> 07:31.053
You'll be living far away.

07:32.515 --> 07:34.250
But I wish you would have told me.

07:36.788 --> 07:38.370
Well, what for? What?

07:38.417 --> 07:40.672
So you could plan some embarrassing party?

07:44.177 --> 07:46.441
Because I'm your friend.

07:52.945 --> 07:55.762
Well, we're still going to be friends, aren't we?

07:59.525 --> 08:02.623
Well, first shift as an attending, last shift at County.

08:02.675 --> 08:04.382
It's quite a day.
Yeah.

08:05.087 --> 08:07.092
How soon are you leaving?
Tonight.

08:09.295 --> 08:10.491
Tonight?!

08:12.457 --> 08:15.232
Abby!
I'm sorry, I know, but can you
just please not tell anybody?

08:15.278 --> 08:18.683
Cos it's just... it's too weird, and I'll... I'll figure out

08:19.107 --> 08:21.221
a way to do it... later.

08:23.337 --> 08:25.330
Rule of today... no crying, right?

08:27.378 --> 08:29.951
Hey!I got two guys coming in... fight at a synagogue.

08:34.905 --> 08:37.613
Oy vey! Couple of feisty jews, huh?

08:38.835 --> 08:40.923
Hmm?
I don't know. The gloves are off today.

08:41.147 --> 08:42.273
What the hell is this?

08:42.317 --> 08:45.212
Oh, Frank's learning to tango for
his 30th wedding anniversary.

08:45.295 --> 08:48.671
I promised Connie that I would
dance with her at the party.

08:51.417 --> 08:53.303
Keep your head up, Frank.
I can't.

08:53.318 --> 08:56.182
Then I can't see where to put my damn feet!

08:56.715 --> 08:59.971
32-year-old male, lip versus fist, vitals stable.

09:00.036 --> 09:01.930
You're not a mohel, you're a butcher!

09:01.970 --> 09:04.333
The baby is fine, Sheldon.
A little blood is normal!

09:04.371 --> 09:07.004
You were sloppy! You were sloppy with my baby's penis!

09:07.018 --> 09:10.242
End of conversation.
Crazy. I'm done with brises!

09:10.279 --> 09:12.112
Who needs the aggravation?

09:12.948 --> 09:15.423
Hey, do I know you?
I don't know. Do you?

09:16.167 --> 09:18.300
I performed your wedding ceremony.

09:18.545 --> 09:20.321
It's Abigail, right?

09:21.865 --> 09:23.771
Um... Yeah. Abby, actually. It's Abby.

09:23.817 --> 09:27.220
So, how's the first year of married life been?

09:27.237 --> 09:30.541
Oh, well, you know. Has its ups and its downs.

09:30.576 --> 09:32.463
What? He's a slob?

09:32.635 --> 09:35.260
Leaves the toilet seat up, never does
the dishes, that sort of thing?

09:35.306 --> 09:36.743
Something like that. Yeah.

09:36.877 --> 09:39.411
Listen, the ceremony was meshuga.

09:39.695 --> 09:41.512
Those are the ones that last.

09:45.047 --> 09:47.482
Here. Keep this on it.

09:49.965 --> 09:51.530
It was nice to see you again.

09:51.577 --> 09:53.941
Don't worry, it'll get easier.

09:54.306 --> 09:55.672
Shalom to that.

09:58.427 --> 10:00.013
Guys, where's your mom?

10:01.357 --> 10:03.752
Ok, uh, here we go.

10:04.678 --> 10:11.093
I sometimes talk to kids about, you know...stuff.

10:11.117 --> 10:14.043
So why don't we just go right over here?

10:15.377 --> 10:18.612
And if you have any questions

10:20.315 --> 10:23.720
about... sex or drugs or alcohol, you can just shoot.

10:26.345 --> 10:29.061
I know it's hard for kids your age to talk about this stuff,

10:29.117 --> 10:31.050
 but I think it's import...
We can ask you anything?
Yes.

10:31.346 --> 10:34.510
Is it true that if you sneeze with
your eyes open, they'll pop out?

10:34.535 --> 10:36.040
Can vampires get AIDS?

10:36.106 --> 10:37.971
If you put a penny on the El Track, will the train crash?

10:38.017 --> 10:39.972
Why can't we wear pajamas in the daytime?

10:40.017 --> 10:42.310
Our brother got a girl pregnant, but he won't marry her.

10:42.335 --> 10:44.410
Why do you think he won't?
Ok. Am I...?

10:44.436 --> 10:47.492
Am I being punk'd?
Crit's dropping in two.

10:47.845 --> 10:51.172
You guys, stay right there.
How do blimps fly?!

10:51.227 --> 10:53.652
What about chest and belly films?
Haven't done it yet.

10:53.678 --> 10:55.622
What's taking so long?
Processor's down.

10:55.676 --> 10:58.460
That's ridiculous.
550 out of the chest tube,

10:58.477 --> 11:00.833
hemoglobin's dropped to 11.
All right, hang o-neg,

11:00.876 --> 11:03.250
call for type specific...

11:03.306 --> 11:07.603
This is Lily.
His fiancee.

11:05.215 --> 11:07.603
He's gonna be ok, right?
That's the plan.

11:07.898 --> 11:10.152
Sats only 83.
All right... 

11:10.406 --> 11:12.932
Deep breaths for me.
Put him on a non-rebreather.

11:12.957 --> 11:15.832
Let's set up for intubation.
Etomidate and sux... 8-0.

11:15.875 --> 11:18.092
Paul, we're gonna have to put
another tube in to help you breathe.

11:18.116 --> 11:20.170
You're not gonna be able to speak.
All right.

11:20.397 --> 11:21.472
Zeke...

11:22.706 --> 11:24.401
it's not your fault, ok?

11:24.647 --> 11:26.092
I don't blame you.

11:26.336 --> 11:27.673
Hear me?

11:29.508 --> 11:31.341
Say you hear me.

11:32.018 --> 11:33.253
I hear you.

11:35.286 --> 11:37.402
Pushing the meds.
Uh, no, oh, no!

11:37.436 --> 11:38.911
All the bulbs are out.

11:39.668 --> 11:41.571
Ok, folks, give it to me straight.

11:41.636 --> 11:43.243
GSW to the chest.

11:43.278 --> 11:45.622
First unit is up.
First unit? That's all?

11:45.677 --> 11:48.003
Hemodynamically stable five minutes ago.

11:48.306 --> 11:51.401
Ok, get this crowd out of here.
This is his girlfriend.

11:52.186 --> 11:54.412
All right, just the globetrotters.

11:54.477 --> 11:56.821
All right, you guys, you're gonna have
to step out while we work, ok?

11:56.877 --> 11:58.871
No way!
We're not gonna leave until you guys...

11:58.905 --> 12:01.090
Hey, meadowlark, did you hear what the lady said?

12:02.526 --> 12:05.191
I prefer to give blood products before the vitals take a dive.

12:05.218 --> 12:07.990
It works out much better that way. I don't like to transfuse

12:08.018 --> 12:11.211
without a clear reason.
Oh, like being shot in the chest?

12:11.898 --> 12:13.210
Where's the bullet?

12:16.316 --> 12:19.021
Oh, what's the CT show?
- CT takes an hour.

12:19.036 --> 12:20.352
Oh, please.

12:20.415 --> 12:22.012
Our patients don't need the radiation

12:22.046 --> 12:24.133
and a thousand dollar bill for an unnecessary scan.

12:24.206 --> 12:28.373
Oh, yes, the victim complex... "It's all so hard here at County,

12:28.718 --> 12:30.950
"boo-hoo, takes so long, nothing works."

12:31.078 --> 12:34.343
You think this is tough, kiddies?
Try a cinderblock hut in Malaysia.

12:34.376 --> 12:36.723
I'll call radiology again.
Look, I know you're like

12:36.778 --> 12:40.191
Tsunami Mary or something, but we really
don't need the war stories right now, ok?

12:40.215 --> 12:42.603
I don't believe we've been properly introduced.

12:44.666 --> 12:46.603
I'm Cate Banfield.
Abby Lockhart.

12:46.618 --> 12:48.680
You're a baby attending, flying blind here.

12:48.717 --> 12:51.553
Take my help if you want to stick around.
Otherwise, feel free to use the door.

12:51.576 --> 12:55.090
And I'm talking about the big picture. So, there are your options.

12:57.016 --> 12:58.542
I'll keep that in mind.

13:02.925 --> 13:04.402
Who wants to intubate?

13:07.577 --> 13:10.293
Hemoglobin's stable, 11.1.

13:10.578 --> 13:12.641
That might be a sign that the bleeding is slowing down.

13:12.708 --> 13:13.951
Not necessarily.

13:15.356 --> 13:16.950
Hang another unit.

13:17.705 --> 13:18.932
Introducer.

13:18.976 --> 13:21.892
Let Gates finish that, I need you to run the board.

13:26.888 --> 13:28.922
Call me when the films are ready.
All right.

13:30.488 --> 13:32.580
He said they were from the neighborhood.

13:32.615 --> 13:34.663
He did?
What, you didn't hear
what Coach told the cops?

13:34.675 --> 13:38.082
I don't know who they are!
You guys, settle down. Try to stay out of the way, ok?

13:38.118 --> 13:42.020
They live in your building, don't they?
Dr Lockhart! She's so blue.

13:42.225 --> 13:44.750
Can you give her something?
I'm not a vet, and

13:44.856 --> 13:47.860
cats aren't allowed in the ER.
Is there anything else I could do for you?

13:47.918 --> 13:52.888
Oh, my water pill. I need a refill, please.

13:50.536 --> 13:54.503
You know what? This has got to stop.
You have to get yourself a real doctor.

13:54.995 --> 13:56.882
You're not a real doctor?

13:57.655 --> 13:59.853
Mrs Gaines, you know what I mean.

14:00.796 --> 14:02.793
I'm not gonna be here forever.

14:03.358 --> 14:06.061
You have such a dark perspective.

14:06.348 --> 14:10.570
I'm drawn to you, dear.
So... so sue me.

14:10.606 --> 14:12.462
Can you hang on a minute? I'll be right back.

14:12.517 --> 14:15.250
Hey! At least you don't sneeze anymore!

14:15.536 --> 14:17.802
Yeah, I take antihistamines when I see you coming!
Aah!

14:18.756 --> 14:20.702
What are you doing? I thought you were taking a break.

14:23.167 --> 14:25.031
Ever been at a crossroads?

14:26.096 --> 14:27.793
Who do you think you're talking to?

14:29.176 --> 14:30.572
That's how I feel,

14:31.718 --> 14:34.321
like something's changing, but I don't know what it is.

14:35.386 --> 14:37.460
It gets easier once you get used to it.

14:39.127 --> 14:41.050
I keep thinking about what he said.

14:44.708 --> 14:47.003
The last words of Greg Pratt were,

14:47.886 --> 14:50.071
"Don't screw it up, Morris."

14:55.596 --> 14:56.893
You won't.

14:59.965 --> 15:02.920
If I were in trouble, Archie, I would call for you.

15:05.928 --> 15:07.271
I would.

15:08.008 --> 15:09.693
I would trust you with anything.

15:14.105 --> 15:16.752
And I didn't always feel that way, but I do now.

15:20.685 --> 15:23.341
Actually, why don't you get up and come with me?

15:25.315 --> 15:27.670
Can you die from eating pop rocks and soda?

15:27.707 --> 15:30.473
If I hold in a fart, will I explode?
Why don't you try to find your mom.

15:30.505 --> 15:32.143
Check the front desk.

15:32.357 --> 15:36.790
Dr Morris, this is Roxanne Gaines. She's on captopril, lasix,

15:36.815 --> 15:40.571
Ambien and glyburide. She comes
in around once a month for refills,

15:40.606 --> 15:43.293
sometimes more often when she
shares her meds with her cat.

15:43.316 --> 15:45.670
Yeah, well, Purdy has insomnia.

15:44.806 --> 15:47.970
Ma'am, you can do all of this
at your primary physician's office...

15:47.985 --> 15:50.712
No, wait, Morris, please, can you just do this for me?

15:51.197 --> 15:53.743
What?
If I'm ever not here, Roxanne,

15:53.775 --> 15:55.752
ask for Dr Morris.
Abby...

15:55.937 --> 15:57.360
Look, just do it.

15:57.698 --> 15:59.061
I'm trusting you.

15:59.636 --> 16:02.561
Got films on your guy in two.
Maybe you guys should chat.

16:01.486 --> 16:04.220
Get to know each other.

16:05.966 --> 16:08.792
A little kooky, but I love her.

16:09.346 --> 16:10.293
Yeah.

16:10.587 --> 16:12.033
Join the club.
Mmm.

16:13.705 --> 16:15.402
What's going on with the heplock?

16:15.817 --> 16:17.933
I got duped... the guy used it to OD.

16:18.256 --> 16:20.482
Well, that's a calculated risk... we've all done it.

16:20.518 --> 16:22.482
What, are they gonna put a letter in your file?

16:22.536 --> 16:25.530
Nursing supervisor called me, said to be prepared.

16:25.847 --> 16:28.081
What, they gonna fire you?
I don't know.

16:28.117 --> 16:30.622
Screw 'em. I can always find another job.

16:32.628 --> 16:34.682
Oh, come on, you don't really want that, do you?

16:45.435 --> 16:48.293
Got your films. Blood gas looks good.

16:50.578 --> 16:53.301
Where's Cruella De Ville?
Covering for you, we hear.

16:53.336 --> 16:55.762
And real happy about it.

16:57.218 --> 16:59.173
Bullet's in the belly... call surgery.

17:00.336 --> 17:02.531
And you threaded the subclavian into the neck.

17:03.097 --> 17:04.501
Crap.
Yeah.

17:05.325 --> 17:07.152
How's the board look, doctor?

17:08.637 --> 17:11.383
Um, clear with a white frame, lots of writing on it.

17:11.417 --> 17:14.191
If you put pressure on the clavicular fossa

17:14.218 --> 17:17.670
as you're threading in the subclavian, it
prevents if from going up into the jugular.

17:17.974 --> 17:20.700
Cool.
You know what that's called?
The "finger in the fossa" trick.

17:20.715 --> 17:22.913
Points to the new lady for stealing the punch line.

17:23.616 --> 17:24.853
Nice pickup.

17:27.297 --> 17:29.460
Go next door and see what's going on.

17:29.565 --> 17:31.513
Ok, you know, as much as I enjoy being your bitch, I...

17:31.537 --> 17:34.402
Dr Gates has been duly schooled, we'll take it from here.

17:36.265 --> 17:38.271
Get set up to fix your line.

17:42.307 --> 17:44.593
Hey. Hey, hey, hey!
You did this, man! It's your fault!

17:44.615 --> 17:47.741
Can I get some help in here?!
Why? Why'd you guys do it?!

17:48.038 --> 17:50.173
Guys, knock it off!
Guys! Come on, guys!

17:50.286 --> 17:54.112
You did this! 
It's his fault! He got Coach messed up!

17:54.145 --> 17:56.403
Let's go.
Come on. Let's go.

17:56.406 --> 17:58.762
It's his fault Coach is in here!
Outside.

18:00.326 --> 18:03.290
Get off me. Get off me!
Hey, I'm trying to help you.

18:04.228 --> 18:05.443
Come here.

18:06.748 --> 18:08.710
Sit down.
Sit down.

18:11.937 --> 18:13.542
Hold this on it.
What for?

18:13.577 --> 18:14.752
Just do it.

18:20.775 --> 18:22.263
Is Coach ok?

18:22.586 --> 18:24.083
He's gonna be.

18:25.145 --> 18:26.852
It's not my fault.

18:28.907 --> 18:30.623
Why would it be your fault?

18:32.108 --> 18:33.900
I just said it's not.

18:36.777 --> 18:38.830
I didn't even think
he'd be there.

18:40.437 --> 18:42.080
Where, his apartment?

18:45.808 --> 18:47.631
Coach knows how it is.

18:48.208 --> 18:51.200
He's been through his own rough times and got past it.

18:51.238 --> 18:52.901
That's what he teaches us.

18:54.845 --> 18:56.641
That's a good thing to teach.

18:57.526 --> 18:59.401
I think you're gonna need some stitches.

19:04.395 --> 19:07.663
Zeke...
Why?! It's... it's not like they say.

19:08.047 --> 19:12.492
He would give you anything
you needed! You know that!

19:13.356 --> 19:14.982
I'm sorry.

19:15.527 --> 19:17.020
I'm sorry!

19:17.078 --> 19:19.551
Oh, Lily, you're gonna have to step out, ok?
You know that!

19:19.608 --> 19:22.420
Haleh, can you bring her back in there?

19:22.475 --> 19:25.990
Then I'm gonna need some 4-0 prolene... and a 1% lido.
Ok.

19:30.875 --> 19:32.503
Abby...
Lucien, have you seen a kid running around?

19:32.518 --> 19:35.262
He's about 15, like yay high?
No, not that I know.

19:35.276 --> 19:37.391
I thought you were working at a surgi-center somewhere.
Well, I was-I wa...

19:37.606 --> 19:40.620
Haleh, you seen that kid, Zeke?
Not since you were with him.

19:40.635 --> 19:41.992
I'm getting your lido.
Thanks.

19:42.015 --> 19:45.741
I told myself, you know, I could walk
away and never think twice, but...

19:45.776 --> 19:48.510
Frank, if you see any of my basketball
kids roaming around, let me know?
Okey-dokey.

19:49.536 --> 19:52.001
This is County.
Is, um, is Frank dancing?

19:52.037 --> 19:53.400
Yep. Keep your head up, Frank.

19:53.438 --> 19:56.372
Well, it turns out I can't imagine working anyplace else.

19:58.206 --> 20:00.890
You can't?
No, I can't. Can you?

20:02.318 --> 20:05.263
Well, I mean, it wouldn't... wouldn't be easy,

20:05.306 --> 20:08.670
but I think for the right reasons, yeah.
Is there something you're not telling me?

20:09.235 --> 20:10.470
No.
Come on.
Yeah.

20:12.015 --> 20:14.321
Luka and I are moving to Boston.
What?!
Don't tell anybody.

20:14.322 --> 20:15.322
Really?
Yeah.
Oh...

20:15.615 --> 20:17.430
I can't go there cos that'll just get me started.
Right, right, right.

20:17.478 --> 20:20.303
There's your lido.
Thanks.
Ok. Well, then no problem.

20:20.826 --> 20:24.211
Wow. Ok, so we'll talk later, then.
So I have to find this kid. All right.

20:26.335 --> 20:29.681
Why do monkeys love bananas?
What's a douche bag?

20:29.705 --> 20:32.433
Where the hell is their mother?
I wanted to talk to you about my future.

20:32.475 --> 20:35.882
Yeah, you know what, Grady? I'm not
the right person cos I'm a short-timer.

20:35.918 --> 20:38.473
You are? Yeah. 
How short?
Really short.

20:39.305 --> 20:41.583
Today's my last shift. Don't tell anybody.

20:41.877 --> 20:45.152
But I was just about to say what a
great mentor you've been and ask you...

20:45.326 --> 20:47.342
I find this pretty upsetting. Look, you're good. 

20:47.378 --> 20:51.113
You don't need me anymore. You don't.
Abby, he's on the roof.

20:59.835 --> 21:02.081
Hey, Zeke, I didn't get a chance

21:02.125 --> 21:04.861
to finish dressing your cut.
Don't come over here.

21:07.356 --> 21:09.041
Hey, you know, these things, they don't, 

21:09.076 --> 21:12.691
don't usually work out the way we think they're going to,

21:14.458 --> 21:16.082
cos it's, uh... you know,

21:17.447 --> 21:21.650
it's the middle of the day, it's a crowded street,

21:23.108 --> 21:24.383
and you'll probably end up...

21:25.066 --> 21:26.880
landing on a bunch of tourists.

21:35.426 --> 21:37.220
Hey, what are we doing up here?

21:45.517 --> 21:50.392
After Jamal got shot... out in Tinley,

21:52.005 --> 21:55.553
Coach told us if we ever needed a place to go...

21:57.196 --> 21:59.333
to be safe or just chill...

22:02.875 --> 22:05.693
he left his key in one of those little magnet boxes 

22:06.398 --> 22:08.372
behind the radiator.

22:12.206 --> 22:17.081
Those kids hassle me... all the time.

22:18.966 --> 22:21.820
I told them I could take them to a place,

22:22.107 --> 22:24.910
where we could just party,

22:25.558 --> 22:28.140
hang out, do whatever we wanted there.

22:31.197 --> 22:34.160
After Coach came in, everything got crazy.

22:35.507 --> 22:37.353
I couldn't stop them.

22:38.865 --> 22:41.601
I promise I'm going to fix up your coach, if you'll just please,

22:41.636 --> 22:43.981
 please, just come back away from there, ok?

22:44.627 --> 22:46.061
I...
All right, listen.

22:28.882 --> 22:47.750
I'm gonna...

22:50.976 --> 22:54.190
Look at this. Come here, look at
this, just look at this, all right?

22:54.648 --> 22:56.052
You take it?

22:59.385 --> 23:02.320
I don't live up to my end of the
deal, you inject that into your vein

23:02.376 --> 23:04.341
and your heart will stop beating.

23:05.436 --> 23:07.430
I'm not stupid.
I'm not kidding.

23:09.476 --> 23:12.103
It's called a fatal arrhythmia.
And if I don't live up to my part,

23:12.136 --> 23:15.253
 you could take the syringe and you
could do with it whatever you want.

23:15.805 --> 23:17.773
Are you nuts or something?

23:22.897 --> 23:25.863
I just know what it's like to be out on a ledge.

23:28.126 --> 23:30.113
And, yeah... I'm nuts.

23:32.866 --> 23:36.083
So why don't you just please,
just please come back here, ok?

23:37.128 --> 23:38.181
Come on.

23:40.415 --> 23:42.580
Come on, Zeke. Come here, come on.

23:58.166 --> 23:59.330
It's ok.

24:05.698 --> 24:08.680
Listen to me, we have a man bleeding
out. Another unit on the rapid infuser.

24:08.716 --> 24:11.701
We are bringing the GSW now.

24:11.805 --> 24:14.803
Switch to the portable, we're going.
Can someone tell me what's going on?

24:14.836 --> 24:16.840
He is losing blood faster than we can replace it.

24:16.876 --> 24:19.212
The surgeons need to get in there and repair the injury.

24:19.278 --> 24:21.363
Seems too red.
Run of six!

24:21.537 --> 24:23.542
All right, let's roll. He's still got a pulse.

24:23.576 --> 24:26.670
If we send him upstairs with a crappy BP
and intermittent v-tach, he's gonna arrest.

24:05.361 --> 24:29.180
The longer we argue about it,
the greater the chance of that.

24:29.218 --> 24:31.070
She's right about that. Well, we're much more
equipped 

24:31.115 --> 24:33.112
to handle a code down here, trust me.

24:34.638 --> 24:38.183
Abby...
He's in v-tach. All right, loss of pulse.

24:38.207 --> 24:40.252
Thorocotomy tray.
Starting compressions. Charging to 360.

24:40.277 --> 24:42.841
Sterile 7s and a 10 blade.
What are you doing?

24:42.875 --> 24:44.801
We have to open his chest.
Abby, look at this.

24:51.905 --> 24:53.570
Look at the left hemi-diaphragm, the edge is obscured.

24:53.607 --> 24:56.003
Yeah, it's a hemothorax.
It happens. Clear!

24:57.577 --> 24:59.050
Still in v-tach.

24:59.278 --> 25:01.330
All right, Haleh, prep the chest.

25:01.395 --> 25:03.382
You slowed us down enough to make this inevitable.

25:03.416 --> 25:06.240
360 again. Stand by with epi.
Isn't it possible that the chest tube 

25:06.276 --> 25:09.072
went through the diaphragm?
You can see the tip of the tube right there. Clear!

25:09.806 --> 25:13.273
Yeah, well, maybe it only looks like the tip.
The end is obscured by blood, see?

25:13.306 --> 25:16.010
Back in sinus.
Strong radial pulse.

25:16.035 --> 25:18.720
All right, let's get him to the OR before this happens again.

25:20.818 --> 25:22.182
All right. 
Wait.
No. No.

25:22.215 --> 25:23.550
Grady's right.

25:26.177 --> 25:29.790
That is highly unlikely, and we can't prove it here.

25:29.898 --> 25:31.901
Maybe we can see it with the ultrasound.

25:31.936 --> 25:34.981
Here, let me see that. We did an ultrasound an hour ago.
Yeah, but it's easy to miss.

25:35.007 --> 25:37.271
A dislodged clot in the spleen could have caused...

25:37.307 --> 25:40.380
Could have caused a precipitous
arterial bleed to drain out the chest tube.

25:41.048 --> 25:42.282
Get out of the way.

25:43.106 --> 25:45.121
Yeah, I can't get a good view.

25:45.365 --> 25:48.950
Haleh, call down to the pharmacy and
have them deliver some fibrin glue.

25:49.015 --> 25:50.803
Dr Lockhart... Fibrin what?
It's a tissue adhesive.

25:50.836 --> 25:53.200
It can be used for splenic hemostasis.

25:53.238 --> 25:55.621
I think the dose is 2,000 units, but you'd better check.

25:55.675 --> 25:57.600
Stop. Enough. We are done.

25:57.626 --> 26:00.033
He is a green resident, and you're a newbie attending.

26:00.076 --> 26:01.671
And we're not messing around on that kind of hunch.

26:01.706 --> 26:04.452
But wait, just hold on, hold on!
I know it's my first day.

26:04.475 --> 26:08.312
You don't know anything about me or my clinical judgment, but it's not really
my first day.

26:08.346 --> 26:12.792
I've been here almost ten years,
and I know when I know something.

26:13.685 --> 26:17.081
And you've been here for a week.
So just... Can you just give me this?

26:24.578 --> 26:26.611
Your five minutes are up.
Almost there.

26:26.635 --> 26:28.592
Over a litre out now.
I'm so sorry, 

26:28.617 --> 26:30.292
we were stuck with a grade five liver.

26:30.316 --> 26:33.450
Put him in Trendelenburg.
Ok, here we go.

26:33.636 --> 26:35.830
How long does it take to clot?
How long does what take?

26:35.976 --> 26:38.252
Fibrin glue.
Couple seconds, I think.

26:38.277 --> 26:40.172
We think the chest tube's actually in the spleen.

26:40.187 --> 26:42.762
You think?
Yeah, no scan, we can't see anything.

26:42.777 --> 26:46.382
So how'd you come up with this plan?
Grady. He was paying attention.

26:49.737 --> 26:53.553
Seems to have worked.
Oh, God, thank you...

26:56.105 --> 26:58.153
Systolic's up to 90.

26:58.397 --> 27:00.602
Ok, clamp the tube.
Let's get him out of here.

27:00.638 --> 27:03.483
Can I go with him?
No, it's better if you wait down here.

27:07.118 --> 27:08.603
Impressive.

27:11.095 --> 27:13.502
Well... I'm a skilled practitioner and an excellent teacher.

27:13.517 --> 27:15.180
It's just getting too hard to deny it.

26:46.559 --> 27:17.833
Well, I've never heard of using fibrin glue this way.

26:49.519 --> 27:23.390
Yeah, to tell you the truth, I have absolutely no idea where that
came from.

27:23.417 --> 27:26.212
Just lodged in here somewhere.
Well, it's a good job it was,

27:26.237 --> 27:28.460
and I see you've met our new chief.

27:28.977 --> 27:31.081
Hmm? She's not the chief of me.

27:34.215 --> 27:36.452
Lucien's waiting for us in OR 1.
Ok.

27:41.635 --> 27:44.380
Zeke, you can't be up here. Go do your thing.

27:44.556 --> 27:46.653
What are you doing?
Where's the nurse I left you with?

27:46.918 --> 27:49.892
He... he looks bad.
He's pale from blood loss. 

27:49.918 --> 27:51.791
But the surgeons are gonna fix that.

27:52.746 --> 27:54.941
If he doesn't make it...

27:56.428 --> 27:58.943
Hey, hey. Now I kept my end
of the deal so far, right?

28:00.057 --> 28:02.771
All right, now you have to keep yours

28:02.805 --> 28:04.480
and just go down there and wait with the nurse.

28:06.048 --> 28:09.103
Zeke, this is going to be all right.

28:11.197 --> 28:13.253
You just have to keep telling yourself that.

28:14.765 --> 28:16.660
All right,
I'll see you later.

28:20.707 --> 28:22.500
A little more traction here.
Coker.

28:22.517 --> 28:26.313
End tidal looks good.
All right, into the peritoneum.

28:27.528 --> 28:29.932
You guys are gonna bring this home for me, right?

28:34.066 --> 28:36.051
Splenic artery's sheared off.

28:36.316 --> 28:39.901
You know, we get tired of hearing how you
guys had to come in and clean up our messes...

28:39.915 --> 28:42.822
We can autotransfuse what's left
back through the splenic vein.

28:44.066 --> 28:46.572
But the fact is, sometimes you do.

28:46.788 --> 28:49.371
VBG's 7.38.
Ok, pickups.

28:51.905 --> 28:55.311
Oh, let's make this
one more for the road, huh?

28:58.015 --> 29:00.400
Here's our bullet. Right.

29:06.917 --> 29:10.261
Curved clamp to Neela. Splenorenal ligament is isolated and...

29:10.896 --> 29:13.593
And cut. Excellent.

29:13.618 --> 29:15.320
Looking up, Abby.

29:16.396 --> 29:17.480
Great.

29:18.638 --> 29:20.053
That is great.

29:20.186 --> 29:23.802
Okay, Bovie. Let's watch out for the...
Gastroepiploic artery. I see it.

29:23.858 --> 29:26.851
Ok, bullet completely spared the stomach and liver.

29:27.855 --> 29:30.363
You guys are so good at this.

29:30.446 --> 29:33.903
I mean, just really, really good...

29:34.206 --> 29:36.811
Systolic's holding at 98.
Oh-silk. Oh-silk.

29:39.517 --> 29:41.810
And I love what you've done up here.

29:42.918 --> 29:45.693
This new observation deck is very comfortable.

29:45.716 --> 29:48.210
Nicely lit, nice, big window.

29:48.746 --> 29:51.333
Way to go. Posterior margin's free.

29:51.435 --> 29:52.753
Mobilize it.

29:52.807 --> 29:54.762
Curved clamp.
Clamp to Lucien.

29:55.666 --> 29:57.863
And you know, you two are like...

29:58.936 --> 30:01.410
like yin and yang. Have you ever thought about...

30:01.435 --> 30:03.800
I don't know, dating?

30:05.776 --> 30:07.791
I mean, why ask, what if, right?

30:10.546 --> 30:13.173
Ok, I'm gonna go tell them he's out of the woods.

30:13.247 --> 30:15.840
Yes, why don't you do that?
Yeah, we're fine here.

30:15.876 --> 30:18.372
And I'm going to be punching out soon, so...

30:23.836 --> 30:25.041
Thank you for this.

30:28.706 --> 30:30.451
I'll see you sometime.

30:34.027 --> 30:35.352
Be good.

30:50.688 --> 30:52.603
They're almost done.
It's going well.

30:53.188 --> 30:54.372
Good.

30:54.515 --> 30:57.290
His people are in the family room. I'll update them.

30:58.177 --> 31:01.711
You know, you won't really have
me to beat up on after tonight.

31:03.125 --> 31:05.201
So I understand.

31:06.128 --> 31:10.031
You know, despite some obvious issues with authority,

31:10.107 --> 31:12.003
I'm wondering why you're leaving.

31:12.385 --> 31:13.721
For my family.

31:13.946 --> 31:17.101
I have a husband and a little boy. We just need a fresh start.

31:18.997 --> 31:21.391
How old is your son?
A little over two.

31:23.627 --> 31:25.201
That's a great age.

31:25.717 --> 31:27.600
I love that age.

31:31.605 --> 31:33.792
Well... the shift's almost over.

31:34.815 --> 31:36.760
Nice knowing you.

31:37.725 --> 31:39.431
Good luck here.

31:52.517 --> 31:54.692
Can you give us a minute?
Sure.

31:58.645 --> 32:00.600
I want my syringe back.

32:02.068 --> 32:03.801
He's ok?
Mm-hmm.

32:06.856 --> 32:09.653
And you're gonna have to talk to some
doctors to make sure you're ok, too.

32:13.566 --> 32:15.591
I know you think you're a bad person.

32:16.147 --> 32:18.903
We all think that about ourselves sometimes. But you're not.

32:20.276 --> 32:22.200
You just did a bad thing.

32:22.315 --> 32:24.500
Don't make the same mistake again, ok?

32:32.135 --> 32:35.601
You would have never let me use that thing, would you?

32:38.097 --> 32:41.001
You know what? I really hadn't thought that far ahead.

32:45.776 --> 32:47.251
See you later.

32:50.868 --> 32:52.271
Dr Lockhart!

32:52.635 --> 32:55.172
Dr Lockhart, oh dear, you made me so nervous,

32:55.227 --> 32:57.432
I just, I just had to come back.
What's the matter, Roxanne?

32:57.725 --> 33:00.882
You're sick, aren't you?
No, not anymore.

33:02.337 --> 33:05.961
No? Well, but the way you were talking,
is something bad gonna happen?

33:06.006 --> 33:08.763
No, something good.
Hey, Sam, are you going up now?

33:08.806 --> 33:10.930
Dead nurse walking. I want to talk to you.

33:10.977 --> 33:13.990
Will I see you next time?
Ask for Dr Morris.

33:16.155 --> 33:19.412
So you have to do some stupid monkey
dance for a bunch of cheap suits

33:19.457 --> 33:21.913
to try to justify how we navigate through a broken system,

33:21.946 --> 33:24.950
which is the problem that they
should be looking at in the first place.

33:25.035 --> 33:27.440
You're very articulate today.
I know.

33:29.876 --> 33:32.053
Nurse Taggart, it'll be
a few more minutes still.

33:32.106 --> 33:33.890
Are you kidding me?
It's ok.

33:33.916 --> 33:36.301
No, it's not ok. She's working, all right?

33:36.325 --> 33:40.311
She can't keep bouncing up and down like
some kind of registered yo-yo.
Abby...

33:41.515 --> 33:45.511
Hi. I'm sorry, but don't you think this is kind of ass?

33:45.537 --> 33:48.022
Excuse me.
Who are you?

33:48.036 --> 33:51.420
Abby Lockhart. I used to be a nurse in the ER. I am now an attending
physician as of today.

33:51.475 --> 33:53.582
You'll have to be on the agenda if you want to...

33:53.617 --> 33:56.812
Yeah, right.
Let me break it down for you. What
we do is take care of the patients

33:56.836 --> 33:59.460
that nobody else wants to deal with, all right?

33:59.516 --> 34:03.332
The homeless alcoholics, drug addicts, psychotics.

34:03.378 --> 34:09.190
All of us, especially the nurses,
put ourselves at risk every day.

34:09.835 --> 34:12.871
Every day. And when the wards don't want to go over

34:12.918 --> 34:15.692
the nurse-to-patient ratio 

34:15.717 --> 34:18.801
guess who sucks up the surplus? The ER does.

34:18.838 --> 34:21.620
And never mind that that means
having admitted patients parked

34:43.954 --> 34:46.313
on gurneys in the hallway for days,

34:24.237 --> 34:28.331
and that our nurses have
to cover three times as many patients
as anybody else,

34:28.417 --> 34:30.242
we're the safety net.

34:30.456 --> 34:33.811
We do not have the luxury of abiding by the rules

34:33.897 --> 34:36.420
because we don't kick patients out on the streets.

34:37.337 --> 34:40.949
So, we get creative. And yes, it's against the rules

34:40.976 --> 34:44.422
to send a patient home with an IV because
worst-case scenario, he'll do something stupid,

34:44.476 --> 34:48.491
but Sam Taggart is not a worst-
case-scenario kind of person.

34:49.397 --> 34:52.581
But none of us are, because to work down there,

34:52.616 --> 34:57.132
you have to have some sort of faith in
people and in your ability to help them.

34:58.986 --> 35:02.250
She didn't inject the drugs into the IV, the patient did.

35:02.306 --> 35:06.521
And what would you have her do? Deny
a potentially lifesaving treatment

35:06.577 --> 35:09.791
because the guy maybe might do something stupid later?

35:09.818 --> 35:11.632
She's an excellent nurse.

35:18.896 --> 35:21.351
And she did what almost anybody else would do,

35:21.377 --> 35:24.313
and she should not be punished because
a patient made a bad choice.

35:26.456 --> 35:29.593
I mean, we have so many things working against us.

35:29.835 --> 35:31.913
Don't be another one of them.

35:43.747 --> 35:45.742
And they all deserve a raise.

35:49.347 --> 35:51.441
Don't make me come back here.

36:08.998 --> 36:11.483
Have you journeyed to the springs of the sea...

36:15.838 --> 36:18.611
...or walked in the recesses of the deep?

36:40.468 --> 36:42.233
What are you doing with that?

36:43.637 --> 36:44.901
Souvenir.

36:46.826 --> 36:48.513
You come with me.

37:08.328 --> 37:10.463
Some we had to put up for them.

37:10.667 --> 37:12.861
Dr Greene, Greg.

37:14.565 --> 37:17.630
You're the only one who's ever gotten to do two.

37:25.326 --> 37:27.242
I don't see Carter up there.

37:28.416 --> 37:32.773
He wouldn't do it. He said it was
defacing government property.

37:47.247 --> 37:51.170
We're gonna miss you so damn much.

37:57.407 --> 38:00.213
Have the gates of death been shown to you?

38:03.006 --> 38:05.011
Hey! I was looking for you.

38:06.067 --> 38:08.001
Do I have to go up there and apologize?

38:08.037 --> 38:11.620
No. Um, I got a week's suspension,

38:11.677 --> 38:14.741
no pay, but it could have been a lot worse, so...

38:15.887 --> 38:17.182
Thank you.

38:18.635 --> 38:20.460
Nurses got to stick together, right?

38:25.337 --> 38:27.640
All right, I gotta run the catch.

38:29.875 --> 38:32.352
What is the way to the abode of light?

38:35.367 --> 38:38.062
And where does darkness reside?

38:46.248 --> 38:49.360
Frank, passion, intensity!

38:49.405 --> 38:51.692
It's a dance of immigrants stuck between two worlds.

38:51.718 --> 38:55.580
Yeah, well, I'd better get better at
it by Saturday, or I'll be deported.

38:55.837 --> 38:57.453
What, is Connie gonna kick you out?

38:57.478 --> 39:00.261
Worse. She'll make me buy her something expensive.

39:03.487 --> 39:05.073
Hold on a second.

39:05.096 --> 39:06.572
Let me show you.

39:11.197 --> 39:12.612
Apilado.

39:18.047 --> 39:20.272
Now la cadencia.

39:21.555 --> 39:24.730
Five, six, seven, eight.

39:49.267 --> 39:51.602
I've been stumbling around here all day!

39:51.655 --> 39:53.632
What were you waiting for?

39:55.557 --> 39:58.380
Where is everybody?
There's a double run coming in.

40:00.358 --> 40:02.393
I'm taking this.
I'm not here.

40:02.416 --> 40:03.752
Me neither.

40:05.005 --> 40:09.682
Hey, tell that big Croat to bring you
back for a visit sometime.

40:11.095 --> 40:12.983
Keep your head up, Frank.

40:24.296 --> 40:26.992
I guess I let the cat out of the bag, huh?

40:32.878 --> 40:32.878
This kind of group thing, I was sort of hoping to avoid,

40:36.667 --> 40:38.552
but, um, Luka's picking me up, but since you're all here,

40:38.578 --> 40:41.280
I just, I want to say it's been a great decade.

40:43.548 --> 40:44.850
Excuse me?

40:45.977 --> 40:48.743
What the hell?
She's leaving, Archie.

40:50.185 --> 40:52.770
When?
Now, you idiot.

40:53.966 --> 40:55.291
What?!

40:56.157 --> 40:57.842
You are?
Yeah.

40:58.277 --> 41:00.400
She... You are?

41:03.378 --> 41:06.442
Oh, you never said anything.
Well, I just, I...

41:08.065 --> 41:12.580
I kind of thought you got the idea.
I didn't! I didn't!

41:13.666 --> 41:15.631
Oh... I... Well, I'm, well...

41:18.356 --> 41:23.540
You know, Archie, it's amazing that you've managed
to make my last moment here about you.

41:23.578 --> 41:26.043
 I love that.
I love you, too.

41:35.258 --> 41:44.322
I'm gonna miss you guys.
We'll be thinking about you. So long.

41:44.805 --> 41:46.200
Bye, Abby.

42:22.015 --> 42:25.483
Have you comprehended the vast expanses of the earth?

42:32.887 --> 42:35.692
Tell me if you know all this.
