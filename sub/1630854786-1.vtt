[wind whooshing]

00:36.720 --> 00:40.280
[hammer clanking]

00:40.400 --> 00:42.840
[rubble clatters]

00:42.960 --> 00:45.280
[eerie music]

00:55.440 --> 00:56.600
- Azaan,

00:56.720 --> 00:58.600
hold the lantern up higher.

00:58.720 --> 01:00.840
[eerie music]

01:00.960 --> 01:02.360
There it is.

01:02.480 --> 01:04.200
The sarcophagus.

01:05.600 --> 01:08.560
I've finally gone one
better than Ivan Makepeace.

01:10.280 --> 01:11.880
- [Azaan] Who is this Makepeace?

01:12.000 --> 01:14.000
- Oh, he's a rival of mine.

01:15.240 --> 01:16.080
He's good.

01:16.200 --> 01:18.600
[eerie music]

01:18.720 --> 01:19.600
Very good.

01:19.720 --> 01:22.280
[eerie music]

01:22.400 --> 01:23.760
That sarcophagus contains

01:23.880 --> 01:26.640
the mummified remains
of Khenmetptah.

01:27.440 --> 01:29.480
A Second Dynasty princess.

01:30.200 --> 01:32.600
Over 4,000 years old.

01:32.720 --> 01:35.440
[eerie music]

01:35.560 --> 01:36.960
- Then let us hurry.

01:37.080 --> 01:38.960
There's nothing to fear here.

01:39.080 --> 01:42.880
- No, wait, I want to translate
these hieroglyphs first.

01:43.000 --> 01:45.360
[eerie music]

01:45.480 --> 01:48.200
Now, that's 10.

01:50.520 --> 01:51.800
10 hundred.

01:52.480 --> 01:55.120
1,000. That's it now.

01:56.120 --> 01:58.040
What's this figure here doing?

01:58.160 --> 01:59.920
He's touching it.

02:00.040 --> 02:01.720
- It's so beautiful.

02:01.840 --> 02:03.800
- Don't rush, Azaan.

02:03.920 --> 02:05.680
- We are so close.

02:05.800 --> 02:08.320
[eerie music]

02:08.440 --> 02:11.120
- These old tombs
are often built with

02:11.240 --> 02:13.600
[Azaan gasps]

02:15.640 --> 02:16.360
death traps.

02:16.480 --> 02:19.400
[eerie music]

02:19.520 --> 02:21.240
Ivan Makepeace.

02:22.440 --> 02:23.440
- Are you sure?

02:23.560 --> 02:25.240
- Oh, yes.

02:25.360 --> 02:27.320
I'd recognize that
face anywhere.

02:29.960 --> 02:31.600
I told you not to hurry, Azaan.

02:32.920 --> 02:34.120
Now just a moment.

02:34.240 --> 02:35.280
I think I've got this.

02:35.400 --> 02:36.120
[eerie music]

02:36.240 --> 02:40.280
That symbol is death.

02:43.760 --> 02:45.840
Death by a thousand
terrors awaits

02:45.960 --> 02:48.480
anyone who touches
the sarcophagus.

02:48.600 --> 02:49.240
Azaan, wait.

02:49.360 --> 02:52.080
[dramatic music]

02:57.080 --> 02:58.360
It's too late.

02:58.480 --> 03:01.080
[dramatic music]

03:04.360 --> 03:07.080
[dramatic music]

03:43.480 --> 03:46.160
[dramatic music]

04:27.280 --> 04:30.000
[dramatic music]

04:35.560 --> 04:38.080
[man grunting]

04:45.840 --> 04:46.840
- Mr. Rudolph.

04:48.760 --> 04:49.760
- Mr. Sykes.

04:53.280 --> 04:54.600
I don't suppose you could put

04:54.720 --> 04:56.440
that bag back on
my head, could you?

04:56.560 --> 04:58.840
The view was a lot
better in there, you see.

05:00.560 --> 05:02.040
- Very funny, Everett.

05:03.480 --> 05:07.680
I always admire a man who can
laugh in the face of danger.

05:07.800 --> 05:09.280
- Mr. Sykes, what's
all this about?

05:09.400 --> 05:12.000
- You know exactly
what this is about.

05:12.120 --> 05:14.080
The 10 pounds you
borrowed off me last month

05:14.200 --> 05:18.320
for what you termed as
a solid gold investment

05:18.440 --> 05:20.720
from which I've yet
to see any return.

05:21.640 --> 05:22.720
- Oh, that.

05:22.840 --> 05:23.960
- Yeah. That.

05:24.640 --> 05:26.120
So what was it all about?

05:27.320 --> 05:29.040
- You see, I had a tip

05:29.160 --> 05:32.560
that someone needed to offload
some jewelry in a hurry.

05:32.680 --> 05:33.680
- Stolen, was it?

05:33.800 --> 05:35.520
- Nah, nothing like that.

05:36.760 --> 05:38.320
This old girl,

05:38.440 --> 05:40.600
she'd recently lost her husband.

05:40.720 --> 05:44.560
And well, she wanted a few
extra pennies for the funeral.

05:45.760 --> 05:48.200
Anyway, it turned out
pickings were a bit richer

05:48.320 --> 05:49.320
than I thought.

05:50.160 --> 05:51.480
10 pounds just wasn't enough.

05:51.600 --> 05:52.800
So I...

05:54.520 --> 05:55.480
- Yeah?

05:56.960 --> 05:58.600
- Went down the horse track.

05:58.720 --> 05:59.720
- And?

05:59.840 --> 06:02.000
[eerie music]

06:03.520 --> 06:04.480
- Lost the lot.

06:06.520 --> 06:07.280
- Oh, well.

06:09.240 --> 06:10.080
Now, let's see.

06:11.600 --> 06:13.680
That's 10 pounds.

06:13.800 --> 06:18.320
The daily rate of 100%
compound interest over 30 days.

06:19.320 --> 06:21.240
Let's just say you
owe me a lot of money.

06:22.560 --> 06:25.080
Do you have a lot of
money on you at present?

06:25.200 --> 06:26.000
- Not on me at present.

06:26.120 --> 06:27.560
- No, I didn't think so.

06:29.080 --> 06:31.080
Got something to
show you, Everett.

06:31.200 --> 06:33.920
[fire crackling]

06:37.920 --> 06:41.200
This is Alice.
[dramatic music]

06:44.840 --> 06:47.200
Now, she borrowed money
off me, just like you did.

06:48.560 --> 06:49.720
Half a crown.

06:50.680 --> 06:53.120
Only she did it to feed
her little children,

06:53.240 --> 06:55.280
rather than waste it
down at the horse track.

06:57.680 --> 06:58.920
And just like you,

06:59.040 --> 07:01.320
she always had a excuse
for not paying her debt.

07:02.520 --> 07:06.480
Well, I guess those children
are going hungry now.

07:07.480 --> 07:09.480
- You killed her
over half a crown?

07:09.600 --> 07:11.680
- We did more than
that, Everett.

07:11.800 --> 07:15.120
The lads here had their
way with her beforehand.

07:16.960 --> 07:19.320
And then again, afterwards.

07:21.320 --> 07:23.480
You see, this is a lesson

07:23.600 --> 07:26.160
in what happens to
people who owe me money

07:26.280 --> 07:27.520
and then fail to pay up.

07:29.720 --> 07:32.240
But we're not at
that stage just yet.

07:33.320 --> 07:36.000
Little pain will help
the message sink in.

07:36.120 --> 07:38.200
Nobby, get the clamp.

07:38.320 --> 07:39.720
- No, you don't have to do that.

07:39.840 --> 07:41.480
You don't need the clamp.

07:41.600 --> 07:43.080
Don't, don't. No!

07:44.200 --> 07:46.400
[metal creaking]

07:46.520 --> 07:48.240
No! Check my pocket.

07:48.360 --> 07:50.320
I'm about to come
into a fortune.

07:50.440 --> 07:52.120
- Pull the other one, Everett.

07:52.240 --> 07:53.240
Give it another turn.

07:55.560 --> 07:57.400
- There's a telegram
in my pocket.

07:57.520 --> 07:59.960
[metal creaks]

08:00.080 --> 08:01.400
- Which pocket?

08:01.520 --> 08:03.000
- Inside pocket, the jacket.

08:03.120 --> 08:04.440
Left side.

08:04.560 --> 08:05.200
Ah!

08:05.320 --> 08:07.960
[fire crackling]

08:13.360 --> 08:18.360
- Dr. Felix Randolph requests
your presence at eight o'clock

08:19.600 --> 08:22.280
on Thursday the 12th
to discuss the matter

08:24.440 --> 08:26.120
of your inheritance.

08:26.240 --> 08:27.280
- Yeah. I told you.

08:28.720 --> 08:30.920
- What's this all about?

08:31.040 --> 08:33.960
- It's my Uncle Felix Randolph.

08:34.080 --> 08:35.200
You might have heard of him.

08:35.320 --> 08:38.760
- Isn't he some sort
of treasure hunter?

08:38.880 --> 08:39.640
- So they say.

08:41.520 --> 08:43.680
- This is all very
interesting, Everett.

08:44.640 --> 08:46.440
- Thought you might
say that, Mr. Sykes.

08:46.560 --> 08:50.280
- This telegram
says eight o'clock

08:50.400 --> 08:52.520
and you are still sat here.

08:52.640 --> 08:53.840
Shouldn't you be
seeing your uncle?

08:53.960 --> 08:57.360
- Well, it may have escaped
your attention, Sykes,

08:57.480 --> 09:00.720
but I'm currently somewhat
being forcibly detained.

09:02.280 --> 09:03.240
- All right.

09:04.280 --> 09:05.280
Let him go, Charlie.

09:07.000 --> 09:09.680
[metal creaks]

09:10.960 --> 09:12.240
- Much obliged.

09:13.960 --> 09:15.560
Well, I'll let you
know how it goes, then.

09:15.680 --> 09:17.040
- Hold on.

09:17.160 --> 09:19.880
[fire crackling]

09:20.920 --> 09:22.720
You'll do more than
that, Mr. Randolph.

09:22.840 --> 09:24.800
[eerie music]
[fire crackling]

09:24.920 --> 09:27.560
I wanna know exactly what
you stand to inherit.

09:28.680 --> 09:30.640
And when you expect
to receive it.

09:32.560 --> 09:36.080
Because whatever
it is, it's mine.

09:37.120 --> 09:40.440
[dramatic music]

09:40.560 --> 09:42.000
- Everett.

09:42.120 --> 09:43.880
He's coming here?

09:44.000 --> 09:45.840
- Well, he should be.

09:45.960 --> 09:48.520
I sent him a telegram two days
ago requesting his presence

09:48.640 --> 09:49.720
by eight o'clock.

09:51.280 --> 09:53.320
But you can never be too
sure with Everett, can you?

09:54.640 --> 09:56.280
- Well, it's nearly eight now.

09:58.760 --> 10:01.040
You were going to tell
me what happened to Azaan

10:01.160 --> 10:02.480
in the pyramid.

10:02.600 --> 10:04.840
- Ever the curious one, Archie.

10:04.960 --> 10:07.560
I'm pleased to see that some
of my spirit of adventure

10:07.680 --> 10:09.040
has rubbed off on you.
[gentle music]

10:09.160 --> 10:11.120
You certainly didn't
get it from your father.

10:12.520 --> 10:14.880
And the less said about my
other brother, the better.

10:15.000 --> 10:15.840
And his wife.

10:18.000 --> 10:20.680
But look at me now.

10:20.800 --> 10:22.400
I've outlived the lot of them.

10:22.520 --> 10:25.160
[knuckles tapping]
[gentle music]

10:25.280 --> 10:26.560
- That'll be Everett.

10:26.680 --> 10:28.240
- It's all right.

10:28.360 --> 10:29.960
Nancy will see to him.

10:30.080 --> 10:32.520
[gentle music]

10:32.640 --> 10:35.640
[knuckles tapping]

10:38.160 --> 10:39.200
- [Archie] You were
going to tell me

10:39.320 --> 10:40.440
what happened in the pyramid.

10:41.520 --> 10:43.840
- Nothing happened
in the pyramid.

10:45.000 --> 10:47.920
It was hours later that
the curse came into effect.

10:48.800 --> 10:51.400
- You really believe in
ancient Egyptian curses?

10:53.120 --> 10:55.280
- I believe in what I saw.

10:56.920 --> 11:00.200
The curse promised death
by a thousand terrors.

11:00.320 --> 11:03.200
[gentle music]

11:03.320 --> 11:06.920
And by next morning,
Azaan was dead.

11:10.280 --> 11:11.800
And the look on his face...

11:16.000 --> 11:17.720
- Uncle Felix.

11:17.840 --> 11:19.120
So good to see you.

11:20.720 --> 11:22.600
I mean, it's been too long.

11:23.520 --> 11:26.120
- Well, you're always
so busy, Everett.

11:26.240 --> 11:28.960
- This is true,
uncle. This is true.

11:29.080 --> 11:31.160
Lots of irons in the
fire, as they say.

11:31.920 --> 11:34.760
Oh and you, good old-

11:34.880 --> 11:35.720
- Archie.

11:35.840 --> 11:37.320
- Archie.

11:37.440 --> 11:39.720
Good old cousin Archie.

11:39.840 --> 11:41.040
You must be a doctor now.

11:41.160 --> 11:42.720
- Ah, not quite.

11:42.840 --> 11:44.240
Still studying.

11:44.360 --> 11:46.640
Uncle Felix is letting
me use his workshop

11:46.760 --> 11:48.840
while I do my research projects.

11:48.960 --> 11:50.360
- Sounds fascinating.

11:50.480 --> 11:53.680
- Could you get these gentlemen
a drink please, Nancy?

11:54.520 --> 11:56.320
- And one for yourself, uncle?

11:56.440 --> 11:57.840
- No, no, no.

11:59.160 --> 12:01.880
That's part of the
issue, I'm afraid.

12:05.480 --> 12:08.800
[melancholy music]

12:08.920 --> 12:13.680
As you know, gentlemen, I've
always lived an active life.

12:13.800 --> 12:16.080
Be it carving ice
caves in Mongolia

12:16.200 --> 12:19.320
or wading through
marshes and darkest Peru.

12:20.040 --> 12:22.240
Nothing has ever held me back.

12:22.360 --> 12:25.400
Not even the disapproval of
most of the Randolph family.

12:27.000 --> 12:29.040
But these last few months,

12:29.160 --> 12:31.360
I've been finding things
haven't been as easy

12:31.480 --> 12:32.600
as they used to be.

12:33.920 --> 12:37.040
I get breathless just
walking up the stairs

12:37.160 --> 12:38.160
here in this house.

12:39.520 --> 12:41.960
So last week, I
asked a medical man

12:42.080 --> 12:43.560
to come and give
me the once over.

12:43.680 --> 12:44.680
- You could have
asked me, uncle.

12:44.800 --> 12:46.040
- I know, Archie.

12:47.080 --> 12:49.680
But a man likes to keep
some things to himself

12:50.880 --> 12:53.240
until the time is right.
[melancholy music]

12:53.360 --> 12:55.200
And he has put his
affairs in order.

12:57.960 --> 12:59.400
The fact is, gentlemen,

13:00.640 --> 13:04.880
that my old ticker
is on the way out.

13:05.000 --> 13:07.080
[melancholy music]

13:07.200 --> 13:09.920
He tells me that as long
as I keep to my bed,

13:10.040 --> 13:13.920
avoid over exertion,
strong drink, rich foods,

13:14.040 --> 13:15.840
then it should last
until Christmas.

13:17.360 --> 13:21.120
But not beyond.
[melancholy music]

13:22.000 --> 13:23.080
And this is where the matter

13:23.200 --> 13:25.200
of your inheritance
comes into play.

13:27.400 --> 13:30.320
I've spent my life
traveling the world,

13:30.440 --> 13:34.360
collecting rare artifacts
and valuable antiquities.

13:34.480 --> 13:38.040
My collection to date includes
all the major civilizations.

13:39.080 --> 13:41.520
Solid gold coins
from ancient Rome,

13:41.640 --> 13:44.640
beautiful vases from
Ming dynasty China,

13:44.760 --> 13:46.520
and an original da Vinci print

13:46.640 --> 13:48.880
that I found in a
junk shop in Venice.

13:50.840 --> 13:54.960
And all of these things,
with one exception,

13:56.360 --> 14:00.600
I have bequeathed to
the British Museum.

14:00.720 --> 14:03.760
[melancholy music]

14:03.880 --> 14:06.320
- So, what, you're just
gonna give it all away?

14:06.440 --> 14:09.400
- Artifacts such as these
should be seen by everyone,

14:09.520 --> 14:11.480
not to be hoarded
away by an old man

14:11.600 --> 14:12.920
in search of profit.

14:13.040 --> 14:14.400
- I think it's an
excellent gesture.

14:14.520 --> 14:16.440
Is that what all the
commotion was yesterday?

14:16.560 --> 14:17.920
- Yes. Yes.

14:18.040 --> 14:20.400
It took six carriages
to get everything away.

14:21.520 --> 14:24.040
- But you said
with one exception.

14:25.080 --> 14:28.040
- Yes.
[melancholy music]

14:28.160 --> 14:32.080
There is one item so dangerous

14:33.240 --> 14:35.120
it must never see
the light of day.

14:36.680 --> 14:39.720
The sarcophagus of Khenmetptah.

14:39.840 --> 14:42.320
- It's here, in the house?

14:42.440 --> 14:44.600
- Downstairs in the basement,

14:44.720 --> 14:46.800
where it will stay.

14:46.920 --> 14:48.200
I intend to have
it interred there,

14:48.320 --> 14:50.120
bricked up so it can
never be seen again.

14:50.240 --> 14:51.200
- Sorry.

14:52.880 --> 14:53.880
What is a sarcophagus?

14:54.000 --> 14:55.640
[eerie music]

14:55.760 --> 14:58.320
- It's an ancient Egyptian
burial receptacle.

14:58.440 --> 15:00.240
- And what does it look like?

15:00.360 --> 15:03.600
- It's a life-size
solid gold humanoid

15:03.720 --> 15:06.040
covered in precious jewels.

15:06.160 --> 15:07.120
- Can I see it?

15:08.640 --> 15:10.920
- I don't think that's
such a good idea, Everett.

15:11.040 --> 15:13.320
- It sounds so beautiful, uncle.

15:13.440 --> 15:14.280
- Indeed.

15:15.720 --> 15:16.520
It is.

15:17.960 --> 15:19.080
- Well, if it's just
gonna get bricked up,

15:19.200 --> 15:20.680
I probably won't get
another chance, will I?

15:20.800 --> 15:22.320
Oh, come on, uncle, please.

15:23.600 --> 15:25.320
- Yes, of course.

15:25.440 --> 15:27.160
Nancy will show you the way.

15:27.280 --> 15:29.080
[eerie music]

15:29.200 --> 15:30.480
Just one thing.

15:32.640 --> 15:37.480
Whatever you do, do
not lay a finger on it.

15:37.600 --> 15:40.360
[eerie music]

15:40.480 --> 15:42.320
- You hear that, did you?

15:42.440 --> 15:43.360
He's giving it all away.

15:43.480 --> 15:44.440
He's mad. He's mad.

15:47.240 --> 15:48.960
- Was that wise, uncle?

15:50.240 --> 15:52.200
- How much trouble
can he get up to?

15:53.360 --> 15:56.040
Besides, I wanted to
talk to you alone.

15:57.560 --> 16:01.040
I've seen the way that you
and Nancy look at each other.

16:02.080 --> 16:03.440
- Oh.

16:03.560 --> 16:06.000
- No need to be ashamed.

16:06.120 --> 16:09.600
A young man must be allowed
to sow his wild oats.

16:09.720 --> 16:11.800
Just don't get her into trouble,

16:11.920 --> 16:12.960
whatever you do.

16:13.080 --> 16:16.040
- Well, it's a bit
more serious than that.

16:16.160 --> 16:18.040
- Oh, you haven't already
got her into trouble.

16:18.160 --> 16:18.920
- No, no.

16:20.720 --> 16:22.920
I mean, my feelings for her.

16:23.040 --> 16:27.080
[melancholy music]
[rain pattering]

16:27.200 --> 16:29.040
- Your mother wouldn't
have approved.

16:30.360 --> 16:34.920
You're a Randolph, Archie,
carrying on with the maid.

16:35.040 --> 16:36.960
- Well, she's
awfully intelligent.

16:37.080 --> 16:39.680
She's been helping
me with my research.

16:39.800 --> 16:40.920
Just because she's
a maid does not-

16:41.040 --> 16:44.280
- I said your mother
wouldn't have approved,

16:44.400 --> 16:45.400
not that I didn't.

16:46.960 --> 16:48.680
And it won't affect my decision.

16:51.280 --> 16:53.800
- What decision?
[melancholy music]

16:53.920 --> 16:55.960
- I haven't got a lot, Archie.

16:57.280 --> 17:01.640
The treasures that I spent my
life pursuing are all gone.

17:02.840 --> 17:05.840
And the family fortune,
such as it was,

17:05.960 --> 17:10.000
gambled away by
Everett's father.

17:12.160 --> 17:14.280
But I do have this house,

17:16.680 --> 17:20.320
and for what it's worth,
it's yours, Archie.

17:20.440 --> 17:23.240
[melancholy music]

17:23.360 --> 17:26.120
[door rumbling]

17:32.400 --> 17:33.160
- Is this it?

17:34.440 --> 17:36.200
- Dr. Randolph told
me never to touch it.

17:43.720 --> 17:46.080
[eerie music]

17:48.600 --> 17:50.760
[wood creaking]

17:50.880 --> 17:54.680
- Well, I don't
know what to say.

17:54.800 --> 17:58.320
- All I ask is that you
brick up the basement,

17:58.440 --> 17:59.200
as I've said.

17:59.320 --> 18:00.560
- Well, of course.

18:00.680 --> 18:03.800
- Beyond that, you can
stay exactly as you are.

18:05.040 --> 18:08.560
I wouldn't want your
research to be interrupted

18:08.680 --> 18:11.520
by you having to up sticks
and move somewhere else

18:11.640 --> 18:12.920
when I kick the bucket.

18:14.400 --> 18:18.520
- Actually, uncle, there's
something I wanted to tell you.

18:18.640 --> 18:21.640
[eerie music]

18:21.760 --> 18:24.360
[wood rattling]

18:26.280 --> 18:27.840
[eerie music]

18:27.960 --> 18:29.200
- [Everett] Look at that.

18:30.920 --> 18:32.640
- The problem is
with your heart?

18:33.480 --> 18:34.920
- So I'm told.

18:36.240 --> 18:39.600
It appears that I have been
overworking it all these years.

18:40.760 --> 18:43.320
I suppose, in the end, one
always has to pay the piper.

18:45.280 --> 18:48.000
- There are things that
can be done, uncle.

18:48.120 --> 18:49.120
I've read up on it.

18:50.200 --> 18:52.240
Even in my own research.

18:52.360 --> 18:53.880
Currently it's on rats,

18:54.000 --> 18:57.200
but I have successfully
restarted the
heart of an animal.

18:57.320 --> 18:58.800
And there was a
case in Luxembourg-

18:58.920 --> 19:00.520
- Stop, Archie.

19:00.640 --> 19:05.360
I know you mean well, but
I've accepted my condition.

19:06.480 --> 19:08.680
- But your doctor said
there was a chance.

19:08.800 --> 19:13.280
- So long as I stay in
bed, avoid over exertion,

19:13.400 --> 19:17.240
strong drink, rich food,
et cetera, et cetera.

19:18.240 --> 19:20.360
Archie, does that sound
like any kind of life?

19:26.240 --> 19:28.080
I have something
else for you here.

19:31.000 --> 19:32.080
- What's that for?

19:32.200 --> 19:34.480
[eerie music]

19:34.600 --> 19:35.920
- Oh.

19:36.040 --> 19:36.960
The pistol.

19:38.600 --> 19:40.360
Force of habit, I'm afraid

19:41.200 --> 19:43.800
When you sleep
anywhere in the Orient,

19:43.920 --> 19:46.480
it's a good idea to
be close to a weapon.

19:47.520 --> 19:49.800
No, this is what I
want you to have.

19:51.440 --> 19:54.920
It's my journal of
my time in Egypt.

19:55.760 --> 19:58.320
Perhaps you can make
something of it.

19:58.440 --> 20:03.080
Solve the mystery of
the cursed sarcophagus.

20:03.200 --> 20:05.400
[eerie music]
[rain pattering]

20:05.520 --> 20:06.280
I never could.

20:09.480 --> 20:11.680
- It's even more beautiful
than I ever imagined.

20:13.680 --> 20:14.880
It's gold.

20:15.000 --> 20:16.760
It's real gold.

20:16.880 --> 20:18.680
Well, this must be
worth a fortune.

20:18.800 --> 20:20.760
[eerie music]

20:20.880 --> 20:22.920
And he wants to brick
it up down here?

20:24.960 --> 20:26.880
I'll have to see about that.

20:27.000 --> 20:29.560
[eerie music]

20:32.760 --> 20:36.360
Well, uncle, it's been
an absolute pleasure,

20:36.480 --> 20:38.920
but must get back
into town, you know?

20:39.040 --> 20:41.200
Places to be, people
to see and all that.

20:41.320 --> 20:43.720
- Archie, could you
show Everett out please?

20:44.400 --> 20:46.080
I'm a little tired, I think.

20:46.200 --> 20:47.880
- Yes, of course.

20:48.000 --> 20:50.480
[rain pattering]

20:56.480 --> 20:58.680
- Well, it's an
impressive building,

20:58.800 --> 21:00.000
I'll give you that, Archie.

21:03.680 --> 21:05.880
Not sure about these
floor tiles though.

21:06.000 --> 21:09.360
Oh, and this wall here
is gonna have to go.

21:09.480 --> 21:10.600
I mean, these old buildings

21:10.720 --> 21:12.240
are full of these little
rooms, aren't they?

21:12.360 --> 21:14.560
Not really great for
dinner parties, Archie.

21:15.840 --> 21:17.440
- Actually, Everett,

21:17.560 --> 21:19.360
Uncle Felix said he's
leaving the house to me.

21:19.480 --> 21:21.480
[thunder rumbles]

21:21.600 --> 21:22.560
- He said what?

21:23.920 --> 21:27.240
- Well, I'm here for the
summer for my research project.

21:27.360 --> 21:29.800
And he didn't want
to turf me out,

21:29.920 --> 21:31.600
if the worst were to happen.

21:32.680 --> 21:36.680
- And what about that
thingumajig in the basement?

21:36.800 --> 21:38.600
- The sarcophagus?

21:38.720 --> 21:40.800
Well, I suppose
that'll be mine too,

21:41.560 --> 21:43.240
if it's to stay in the basement.

21:45.640 --> 21:47.400
- That's nice, isn't it?

21:47.520 --> 21:49.840
I mean, he writes me to tell
me about this inheritance

21:49.960 --> 21:52.400
and then sends me away packing
with nothing in my pocket.

21:53.160 --> 21:55.040
Typical. Typical of this family.

21:55.160 --> 21:57.560
Always treated me like
a second class relative.

21:58.480 --> 21:59.880
- Well, I'm sorry, Everett.

22:00.000 --> 22:01.680
I don't quite know what to say.

22:06.160 --> 22:07.760
- That's all right, Archie.

22:07.880 --> 22:10.280
You've always been a good lad.

22:10.400 --> 22:13.600
Now tell me more about
this research stuff.

22:13.720 --> 22:15.120
- Well, it's rather
hard to explain

22:15.240 --> 22:16.480
without going into detail.

22:17.840 --> 22:20.400
I could show you, if you like.

22:20.520 --> 22:23.480
[eerie music]
[thunder rumbling]

22:23.600 --> 22:25.680
Medical school is
closed for the summer,

22:25.800 --> 22:28.960
so this is where I've been
conducting my research.

22:29.920 --> 22:30.840
- Not bad, Archie.

22:32.240 --> 22:34.840
[rat squeaking]

22:34.960 --> 22:36.600
What've you got in there?

22:36.720 --> 22:37.520
- Rats.

22:37.640 --> 22:38.800
- Ah.

22:38.920 --> 22:41.440
[rat squeaking]

22:45.200 --> 22:45.960
Very nice.

22:47.720 --> 22:50.400
Yeah. This should do me
for the night, I think.

22:50.520 --> 22:51.880
- Sorry, what?

22:52.000 --> 22:53.200
- You don't mind, do you,

22:53.320 --> 22:55.440
if I bunk down here with you?

22:57.320 --> 22:59.080
- It's just that
there's only one bed.

23:01.120 --> 23:02.240
- That's all right.

23:03.320 --> 23:05.040
You'll be all right on
the floor, won't you?

23:06.840 --> 23:09.920
- It's just I thought you
needed to get back into town.

23:12.240 --> 23:13.000
- No rush.

23:14.400 --> 23:16.120
Thought I might stick
around for a bit.

23:16.240 --> 23:18.800
You know, keep an eye on things.

23:18.920 --> 23:20.040
Watch out for you, Archie.

23:20.960 --> 23:21.920
- Me?

23:23.040 --> 23:26.000
- Yeah, well,
[thunder rumbles]

23:26.120 --> 23:27.960
family is family.

23:28.080 --> 23:31.280
And what with you being the
sole heir and everything.

23:31.400 --> 23:35.400
I mean, it'd be tragic if
anything happened to you.

23:35.520 --> 23:40.320
[suspenseful music]
[rain pattering]

23:41.400 --> 23:44.520
That sarcophi...

23:44.640 --> 23:45.520
- Sarcophagus.

23:45.640 --> 23:46.240
- Yeah.

23:48.120 --> 23:52.200
Did Uncle Felix say
they actually buried
people inside them?

23:52.320 --> 23:54.920
- Yes. Well, only
important people.

23:55.040 --> 23:56.600
Kings and such like.

23:56.720 --> 23:58.640
[suspenseful music]
[rain pattering]

23:58.760 --> 24:02.640
They would mummify the
remains to preserve them,

24:04.040 --> 24:06.360
stick them inside a sarcophagus,

24:08.400 --> 24:09.160
and bury them.

24:11.200 --> 24:13.560
That one, I believe,
belongs to a princess.

24:15.840 --> 24:16.760
- Princess?

24:17.720 --> 24:19.440
- Well, what's left of one.

24:21.160 --> 24:23.560
It's not my area of expertise.

24:23.680 --> 24:25.400
There's more
information in here.

24:25.520 --> 24:27.040
- And what's that?

24:27.160 --> 24:28.520
- Uncle Felix's journal.

24:34.840 --> 24:37.680
According to the available
translated writing,

24:37.800 --> 24:41.120
Princess Khenmetptah was
mummified using a unique process

24:41.240 --> 24:43.880
to perfectly preserve
the body as if in life.

24:45.760 --> 24:48.840
Unusually, the princess
was interred fully intact.

24:49.960 --> 24:52.800
Whereas, in most cases of
Egyptian mummification,

24:53.760 --> 24:56.000
a cut is made on the
left side of the abdomen

24:56.120 --> 24:59.360
and the intestines, liver,
stomach, and lungs are removed

25:00.680 --> 25:02.240
and a hooked instrument was used

25:02.360 --> 25:04.880
to remove the brain
through the nose.

25:05.000 --> 25:05.880
- Bloody hell.

25:06.000 --> 25:07.360
Leave it out, Archie.

25:07.480 --> 25:10.120
[suspenseful music]

25:11.560 --> 25:12.920
- Apologies.

25:13.040 --> 25:15.200
I forget people are
squeamish about these things.

25:15.320 --> 25:16.680
- Yeah, well you'd be
bloody squeamish too

25:16.800 --> 25:19.240
if you'd seen the
stuff I'd seen today.

25:19.360 --> 25:21.080
- What's that?

25:21.200 --> 25:22.520
- Don't worry about it.

25:22.640 --> 25:24.720
I'm gonna get some shut eye.

25:24.840 --> 25:26.600
Probably have bloody
nightmares now.

25:33.600 --> 25:38.400
[thunder rumbling]
[eerie music]

25:39.280 --> 25:43.600
[rain pattering]
[eerie music]

25:50.400 --> 25:55.200
[Everett snoring]
[rain pattering]

26:04.760 --> 26:07.760
[ominous music]

26:07.880 --> 26:12.840
[man groaning]
[ominous music]

26:17.240 --> 26:20.240
[Everett screaming]

26:22.760 --> 26:23.680
- Everett?

26:25.280 --> 26:30.440
[woman murmuring]
[eerie music]

26:32.840 --> 26:35.080
- No! No, no, please, no!

26:35.200 --> 26:37.240
Please! Please!

26:37.360 --> 26:41.360
[eerie music]
[creature growling]

26:41.480 --> 26:42.680
- Khenmetptah!

26:43.880 --> 26:47.440
[creature growling]
[eerie music]

26:47.560 --> 26:50.760
[Everett screaming]

26:51.880 --> 26:56.880
[creature growling]
[eerie music]

26:59.040 --> 27:02.040
The curse has come
for me at last!

27:04.880 --> 27:09.240
[creature growling]
[eerie music]

27:09.360 --> 27:11.600
[men panting]
[rain pattering]

27:11.720 --> 27:13.600
- It wanted to take my heart.
It wanted to take my heart.

27:13.720 --> 27:14.640
- What did?

27:15.880 --> 27:17.400
[woman screams]

27:17.520 --> 27:20.240
[suspenseful music]

27:25.680 --> 27:28.320
[thunder rumbles]

27:30.080 --> 27:32.640
[eerie music]

27:33.880 --> 27:34.840
He's dead.

27:35.920 --> 27:38.360
Dear God, look at
his expression.

27:38.480 --> 27:40.320
[eerie music]

27:40.440 --> 27:41.920
It's almost as if...

27:42.040 --> 27:43.680
- He was scared to death.

27:47.640 --> 27:48.400
- Bloody hell.

27:50.440 --> 27:51.200
What's happened?

27:53.000 --> 27:54.920
- Did you touch it?
[suspenseful music]

27:55.040 --> 27:56.080
- What?

27:56.200 --> 27:57.920
- The sarcophagus.
Did you touch it?

27:58.040 --> 28:00.960
[suspenseful music]

28:01.080 --> 28:01.720
- I...

28:01.840 --> 28:04.840
[suspenseful music]

28:12.040 --> 28:12.960
- I knew it.

28:16.680 --> 28:18.880
He specifically told
you not to touch it!

28:19.000 --> 28:20.120
- I only wanted to have a look.

28:20.240 --> 28:21.760
- It's cursed, Everett.

28:23.160 --> 28:24.120
- Sorry, what?

28:26.480 --> 28:27.320
- Hold the lamp.

28:30.720 --> 28:32.880
- Wait, what are you doing?

28:33.000 --> 28:35.320
- Why do you think he
told you not to touch it?

28:35.440 --> 28:37.320
- Probably thought
I was gonna nick it.

28:38.120 --> 28:38.960
- Were you?

28:39.080 --> 28:42.160
[suspenseful music]

28:43.520 --> 28:45.680
- What's all this about a curse?

28:46.920 --> 28:50.080
- Anyone who touches
the sarcophagus

28:50.200 --> 28:53.320
is doomed to a death
by a thousand terrors.

28:53.440 --> 28:56.440
[suspenseful music]

28:57.760 --> 29:00.600
Something scared the hell out
of you just now, didn't it?

29:00.720 --> 29:02.200
- Just a dream, that's all.

29:02.320 --> 29:03.080
- Was it?

29:04.560 --> 29:06.640
You were screaming and
thrashing on that bed.

29:07.800 --> 29:10.160
I've never seen
anything like it.

29:12.720 --> 29:16.080
If Uncle Felix suffered
the same experience as you,

29:17.120 --> 29:19.000
no wonder his heart gave out.

29:19.120 --> 29:21.000
- That's nonsense.

29:21.120 --> 29:24.960
I mean, yeah, I touched
the sarcophagus.

29:25.080 --> 29:26.040
Uncle Felix didn't.

29:27.120 --> 29:28.960
So how comes he's
dead and I'm not?

29:31.240 --> 29:33.120
- You might have been

29:33.240 --> 29:34.840
if I hadn't have woken you.

29:34.960 --> 29:35.720
- Come on, Archie.

29:37.240 --> 29:38.960
I mean, you're supposed
to be a scientist, right?

29:40.000 --> 29:41.680
Surely you don't
believe in curses.

29:43.280 --> 29:46.280
[suspenseful music]

29:57.120 --> 29:59.840
[birds chirping]

30:08.640 --> 30:11.120
- Archie, are you all right?

30:11.240 --> 30:12.320
- Yes.

30:12.440 --> 30:13.720
A little tired.

30:14.760 --> 30:16.480
Did you manage to sleep much?

30:16.600 --> 30:17.480
- No.

30:18.720 --> 30:19.480
- Me neither.

30:21.040 --> 30:21.680
- Where's...

30:21.800 --> 30:23.160
- Everett?

30:23.280 --> 30:24.640
He was out at the crack of dawn.

30:24.760 --> 30:26.360
Said he had things to do.

30:27.360 --> 30:28.640
- I brought you some tea.

30:30.040 --> 30:31.040
- Nancy.

30:31.160 --> 30:32.480
[gentle music]

30:32.600 --> 30:33.880
You don't have to
do that anymore.

30:34.000 --> 30:37.240
You were employed by my
Uncle Felix, not by me.

30:37.360 --> 30:40.080
You don't have to be a
maid for anyone anymore.

30:40.200 --> 30:41.640
- Well, that's all very
well and good, Archie,

30:41.760 --> 30:44.080
but it also means
I'm out of a job now.

30:44.200 --> 30:45.840
And you don't have one either.

30:45.960 --> 30:47.200
So what will we do?

30:48.440 --> 30:50.840
- Well, don't worry.

30:50.960 --> 30:52.440
As soon as I'm
qualified as a doctor,

30:52.560 --> 30:55.600
we'll be able to open up a
practice far away from here

30:55.720 --> 30:57.640
where I'll just be Dr. Randolph

30:57.760 --> 30:58.400
and you'll just
be Mrs. Randolph.

30:58.520 --> 30:59.760
[uplifting music]

30:59.880 --> 31:01.440
No one will know
your background so...

31:03.800 --> 31:06.320
Why are you looking
at me like that?

31:06.440 --> 31:08.720
- Mrs. Randolph?

31:08.840 --> 31:10.880
Are you asking me
to marry you Archie?

31:12.200 --> 31:17.360
- Oh, well I suppose I am.
[uplifting music]

31:19.480 --> 31:21.160
Well, is that a yes then?

31:21.280 --> 31:22.840
- Of course it is.

31:23.840 --> 31:25.880
You know, deep down
I always wondered

31:26.000 --> 31:27.600
if your feelings
for me were real.

31:28.480 --> 31:30.000
- Of course they are.

31:30.120 --> 31:31.960
- Real enough, I mean.

31:32.080 --> 31:34.360
Compared to what you
might have to sacrifice.

31:36.120 --> 31:38.920
- What are you talking about?

31:39.040 --> 31:40.640
- You know what
I'm talking about.

31:42.880 --> 31:44.400
A Randolph shouldn't
marry someone like me

31:44.520 --> 31:45.680
and you know it.

31:47.000 --> 31:48.960
- Well, I am a Randolph

31:50.240 --> 31:53.200
and I get to say whether
I should marry you or not.

31:54.280 --> 31:55.600
And I say that I should.

31:57.600 --> 32:00.720
[Everett coughs]

32:00.840 --> 32:01.720
- [Everett] Oh, tea.

32:01.840 --> 32:02.600
Very nice.

32:09.040 --> 32:11.000
- You were out
early this morning.

32:11.120 --> 32:12.240
- Yeah.

32:12.360 --> 32:13.680
I wanted to get to
the newspaper office.

32:13.800 --> 32:14.600
See, I've got a pal in there

32:14.720 --> 32:16.040
that can get a story out quick.

32:17.080 --> 32:18.160
Look at that.

32:22.480 --> 32:23.360
- Obituaries.

32:26.640 --> 32:28.440
- Dr. Felix Randolph.

32:32.320 --> 32:34.280
Oh, I've registered the
death over at the town hall

32:34.400 --> 32:37.520
and I've arranged the
undertakers to collect the body.

32:37.640 --> 32:40.520
- You certainly don't
waste any time, do you?

32:41.800 --> 32:43.800
- I'm just thinking
of you, Archie.

32:45.680 --> 32:47.600
Probate is a slow process

32:48.680 --> 32:51.720
and I don't suppose
this research brings

32:51.840 --> 32:53.480
in much money, does it?

32:53.600 --> 32:55.320
- Well, one day it will.

32:56.960 --> 32:58.280
One day I'll be able to prevent

32:58.400 --> 33:01.000
what happened to Uncle Felix.

33:01.120 --> 33:02.680
- You're working on a cure
for death now, are you?

33:02.800 --> 33:04.200
- Not exactly.

33:05.320 --> 33:08.120
But restarting the heart
after a major trauma.

33:10.280 --> 33:11.200
It can be done, Everett.

33:11.320 --> 33:12.880
It's entirely possible.

33:13.640 --> 33:15.680
There was a case in Luxembourg

33:15.800 --> 33:18.160
where a patient had been
pronounced dead for 30 minutes

33:18.280 --> 33:20.960
before being
successfully revived.

33:21.080 --> 33:24.360
And I'm replicating
this process on my rats.

33:25.440 --> 33:26.760
- Do you know there's
a lot of people in town

33:26.880 --> 33:29.240
that make a lot of money
out of killing rats.

33:29.360 --> 33:31.920
And there you are, trying to
bring the buggers back to life.

33:32.040 --> 33:34.080
- Well, all I'm trying to do now

33:34.200 --> 33:36.640
is figure out this
curse business.

33:37.960 --> 33:40.280
It's my understanding that
these ancient Egyptians

33:40.400 --> 33:41.840
were rather advanced

33:41.960 --> 33:45.360
with their pharmacological
and medical knowledge.

33:45.480 --> 33:46.800
- Fascinating, I'm sure.

33:47.440 --> 33:50.160
[eerie music]

33:50.280 --> 33:52.920
- I've been meaning to ask you,

33:55.000 --> 33:57.040
what exactly was it
that you experienced?

34:00.640 --> 34:01.840
- Nothing.

34:01.960 --> 34:03.520
It was just a dream.
[eerie music]

34:03.640 --> 34:06.400
Probably brought on by all
that talk of extracting organs.

34:06.520 --> 34:07.320
- Yes.

34:07.440 --> 34:08.640
Organs.

34:08.760 --> 34:10.240
You said it wanted your heart.

34:11.560 --> 34:12.440
What did?

34:12.560 --> 34:14.960
[eerie music]

34:20.400 --> 34:24.160
- Well, it was like nothing
I'd ever seen before.

34:26.720 --> 34:28.200
She had bandages,

34:30.360 --> 34:32.640
head to toe in bandages.

34:32.760 --> 34:33.840
- A woman?

34:33.960 --> 34:35.400
- She was, once.

34:35.520 --> 34:37.160
- The Princess Khenmetptah.

34:37.280 --> 34:39.000
- Nonsense.

34:39.120 --> 34:41.520
And even if it was
some sort of curse,

34:41.640 --> 34:43.080
then how comes it only
affected Uncle Felix

34:43.200 --> 34:44.440
and not the rest of you?

34:46.280 --> 34:47.720
- I don't know.

34:49.240 --> 34:51.280
- What was the name of
that princess again?

34:52.280 --> 34:53.120
- Khenmetptah.

34:53.240 --> 34:54.560
- How do you spell that?

35:01.280 --> 35:06.320
- K-H-E-N-M-E-T-P-T-A-H.

35:10.720 --> 35:12.840
- Lovely. Thank you very much.

35:12.960 --> 35:14.760
- Why did you want to know that?

35:15.760 --> 35:16.800
- Just interested.

35:16.920 --> 35:19.960
[silly bright music]

35:22.520 --> 35:23.800
[bells clanging]

35:23.920 --> 35:26.920
[hooves clattering]

35:31.600 --> 35:34.280
[suspenseful music]

35:42.360 --> 35:44.360
- Knobby, get the clamp.

35:44.480 --> 35:47.480
[suspenseful music]

35:50.600 --> 35:51.960
What's this?

35:52.080 --> 35:54.440
- It's my hand, Sykes.

35:54.560 --> 35:56.360
You know, for the clamp.

35:56.480 --> 35:58.760
- We're a bit beyond
that stage, Mr. Randolph.

36:00.080 --> 36:02.280
There's something
else you've got two of

36:02.400 --> 36:05.280
that we're gonna be
putting in the clamp today.

36:05.400 --> 36:06.360
Get his pants off, lads.

36:06.480 --> 36:07.600
- Wait, wait, wait a minute.

36:07.720 --> 36:08.880
- You were supposed
to come and see me

36:09.000 --> 36:10.320
after your little meeting.

36:11.240 --> 36:12.360
- I was just on my way.

36:12.480 --> 36:13.400
- You were heading in
the wrong direction.

36:13.520 --> 36:14.800
- No, I was just-

36:14.920 --> 36:15.960
- Get him on the table, lads.

36:16.080 --> 36:18.240
- I had to sort out
a few things, okay?

36:18.360 --> 36:19.440
Take care of business.

36:19.560 --> 36:20.560
- Take care of what?

36:22.200 --> 36:24.120
When are you getting
this inheritance?

36:26.400 --> 36:28.280
- Obituaries. The back page.

36:28.400 --> 36:33.360
[suspenseful music]
[fire crackling]

36:36.920 --> 36:40.640
- Noted Explorer Felix Randolph.

36:43.000 --> 36:43.960
He's dead?

36:46.680 --> 36:47.760
- Died last night.

36:48.680 --> 36:50.480
- Well, that was bloody quick.

36:51.880 --> 36:54.040
Did you have something
to do with this?

36:54.160 --> 36:55.240
- He had a weak heart.

36:56.920 --> 36:58.560
Yeah.

36:58.680 --> 37:00.800
I might have helped things
move along a bit. Yeah.

37:02.240 --> 37:03.000
- Well, well.

37:04.720 --> 37:07.200
I've got to say, I'm
impressed, Everett.

37:07.320 --> 37:09.360
I never thought you had the
balls to do something like that.

37:09.480 --> 37:11.400
- Well, if it's all
the same to you, Sykes,

37:11.520 --> 37:14.560
I'd very much like
to keep hold of them.

37:15.840 --> 37:17.160
- All right.

37:17.280 --> 37:18.160
Let him go.

37:21.320 --> 37:22.800
- Much obliged.

37:23.880 --> 37:25.960
- So what can we expect to
receive from your late uncle?

37:26.080 --> 37:27.120
- Oh, it's beautiful, Sykes.

37:27.240 --> 37:28.840
It really is.

37:28.960 --> 37:33.240
I mean, it's gold, jewel
encrusted, 4,000 years old.

37:33.360 --> 37:34.960
I mean, it's priceless.

37:35.080 --> 37:38.920
Your share of it will certainly
clear my debt with you.

37:42.600 --> 37:44.080
- My share of it?

37:45.920 --> 37:47.600
You do make me laugh, Everett.

37:47.720 --> 37:51.480
I mean, whoever said
anything about shares?

37:53.480 --> 37:57.200
You see, the plan is
I get the inheritance.

37:59.440 --> 38:00.200
And you?

38:01.880 --> 38:04.280
You get to avoid what happened
to Alice happening to you.

38:04.400 --> 38:07.040
- At least I'm not
a woman, Sykes, eh?

38:07.160 --> 38:09.480
- Well, these labs
aren't fussy, Everett.

38:10.720 --> 38:13.640
They've done long stretches
inside. You know how it is.

38:13.760 --> 38:16.920
[suspenseful music]

38:17.040 --> 38:18.560
If I don't see
some hard evidence

38:18.680 --> 38:22.240
of all this money you're gonna
make by the end of tomorrow,

38:22.360 --> 38:23.200
you'll be a dead man.

38:24.400 --> 38:25.480
All right?

38:25.600 --> 38:28.600
[suspenseful music]

38:29.640 --> 38:32.720
[mystical music]

38:35.280 --> 38:36.520
- [Felix Voiceover] Having
exhausted the writings

38:36.640 --> 38:38.280
on the wall of the tomb,

38:39.640 --> 38:41.720
I began to research further
into the life and death

38:41.840 --> 38:43.200
of the princess.

38:44.480 --> 38:47.840
Why had such a prominent person
died at such a young age?

38:50.440 --> 38:52.880
What I discovered
shocked me to my core.

38:53.000 --> 38:54.720
[birds chirping]

38:54.840 --> 38:56.040
- What are you reading?

38:56.800 --> 38:59.680
- This is Uncle Felix's journal.

38:59.800 --> 39:02.760
I'm trying to figure
out this curse business.

39:02.880 --> 39:04.200
According to the journal,

39:04.320 --> 39:06.560
it's only those who've had
direct physical contact

39:06.680 --> 39:09.080
with the sarcophagus
who've fallen victim to it.

39:09.200 --> 39:11.360
- Well, Everett certainly did.

39:11.480 --> 39:12.760
Rubbed his hand all over it

39:12.880 --> 39:14.760
like he was in love with it.

39:14.880 --> 39:17.560
- In love with the gold and
the jewels, I should imagine.

39:17.680 --> 39:20.320
[eerie music]

39:20.440 --> 39:21.760
Which hand did he use?

39:24.480 --> 39:26.040
- His right, I think.

39:29.440 --> 39:31.880
- The same one he used to
shake hands with Uncle Felix.

39:32.000 --> 39:33.640
[eerie music]

39:33.760 --> 39:34.560
I wonder...

39:38.760 --> 39:41.520
[bright suspenseful music]

39:41.640 --> 39:43.280
[bell rings]

39:43.400 --> 39:46.040
[clocks ticking]

39:51.200 --> 39:52.880
- Everett Randolph.

39:54.200 --> 39:56.280
Did you manage to pick up
that jewelry I told you about?

39:56.400 --> 39:58.080
- I'm sorry, Ivy.

39:58.200 --> 40:00.480
Just couldn't get
the cash in time.

40:00.600 --> 40:01.400
- Can't win 'em all.

40:01.520 --> 40:02.720
Maybe next time, eh?

40:03.520 --> 40:06.920
- I've actually got
something for you.

40:07.040 --> 40:08.400
[clocks ticking]

40:08.520 --> 40:09.480
- Let's have a look at it then.

40:09.600 --> 40:11.280
- Well, it's not with me.

40:11.400 --> 40:12.520
It's a bit big.

40:13.680 --> 40:16.200
I need to cash it in quick.

40:16.320 --> 40:17.160
It's in your line.

40:17.280 --> 40:18.880
- What is it? An antique?

40:19.000 --> 40:20.680
- Yeah, you could say that.

40:20.800 --> 40:23.520
4,000 years old, to be exact.

40:25.440 --> 40:27.960
[door rattles]

40:33.280 --> 40:35.320
- What are you going to do?

40:35.440 --> 40:37.760
- Well, we've got
to open her up.

40:37.880 --> 40:38.920
Have a closer look at it.

40:39.040 --> 40:40.000
- Are you sure?

40:41.600 --> 40:42.680
- Don't worry.

40:42.800 --> 40:44.120
I'll be careful.

40:45.640 --> 40:46.400
[wood creaking]

40:46.520 --> 40:48.400
- Oh, you wait till you see it.

40:48.520 --> 40:50.960
I mean, it's beautiful.

40:51.080 --> 40:51.960
It's gold.

40:52.080 --> 40:53.080
It's as big as a person.

40:53.200 --> 40:55.360
It's priceless.

40:55.480 --> 40:58.920
And actually buried an
Egyptian princess inside it.

40:59.040 --> 41:01.920
[clocks ticking]

41:03.760 --> 41:05.000
Khenmetptah.

41:05.120 --> 41:06.840
[eerie music]

41:06.960 --> 41:07.600
You've heard of her, yeah?

41:07.720 --> 41:09.680
- Of course I have.

41:09.800 --> 41:12.680
It's the one Felix
Randolph dug up, isn't it?

41:12.800 --> 41:15.680
- Well, you see
Felix was my uncle

41:16.760 --> 41:18.720
and he died last night,

41:18.840 --> 41:20.480
which is how I managed
to get my hands on it.

41:20.600 --> 41:22.160
[eerie music]
[clocks ticking]

41:22.280 --> 41:23.800
- Poor old Felix Randolph.

41:24.880 --> 41:27.200
Finally caught up
with him in the end.

41:27.320 --> 41:29.240
- What did?

41:29.360 --> 41:32.360
- The curse from
that sarcophagus.

41:32.480 --> 41:37.320
[clocks ticking]
[eerie music]

41:44.160 --> 41:45.800
- I thought so.

41:45.920 --> 41:49.160
There's a layer of oil
coating the sarcophagus.

41:49.280 --> 41:50.480
I'll need to take a sample.

41:50.600 --> 41:52.080
- Be careful, Archie.

41:52.200 --> 41:53.200
- Not to worry.

41:53.320 --> 41:54.920
I'm wearing gloves.

41:55.040 --> 41:57.960
- So you've heard about
this curse then, have you?

41:58.080 --> 42:00.240
- Everybody knows about it.

42:00.360 --> 42:02.680
Everybody in the trade, anyway.

42:02.800 --> 42:05.080
Randolph had to charter his
own ship to bring it to London.

42:05.200 --> 42:06.560
No bugger would touch it.

42:06.680 --> 42:08.000
- It's all nonsense, Ivy.

42:08.120 --> 42:11.080
- And I heard
someone on the ship

42:11.200 --> 42:12.920
thought he'd have a butchers.

42:13.040 --> 42:14.680
And it sent him mad.

42:14.800 --> 42:16.560
He threw himself overboard.

42:16.680 --> 42:18.920
- Ivy, it's not that bad.

42:19.040 --> 42:20.440
I touched it.

42:20.560 --> 42:21.680
I'm not dead.

42:21.800 --> 42:22.720
- You what?

42:25.040 --> 42:25.800
Get out.

42:27.520 --> 42:29.400
And don't you dare bring
that sarcophagus in here.

42:29.520 --> 42:30.920
I don't wanna be
anywhere near it.

42:31.040 --> 42:32.200
- Fine.

42:32.320 --> 42:34.000
I'll take it over to
Irish Bob's place then.

42:34.120 --> 42:36.080
- He'll tell you the
same thing I did.

42:36.200 --> 42:38.360
Anyone in the trade will.

42:38.480 --> 42:40.000
That thing's not priceless.

42:40.120 --> 42:41.440
It's worthless.

42:41.560 --> 42:42.800
[eerie music]
[clocks ticking]

42:42.920 --> 42:45.440
You couldn't pay anyone
to take it off your hands.

42:47.440 --> 42:48.200
Now go on.

42:50.000 --> 42:51.000
Get out.

42:51.120 --> 42:56.040
[eerie music]
[clocks ticking]

42:58.800 --> 43:01.960
[birds chirping]

43:02.080 --> 43:05.320
[suspenseful music]

43:05.440 --> 43:06.720
- What are you doing?

43:06.840 --> 43:07.880
- I have a theory

43:10.840 --> 43:13.840
that this curse is
more pharmacological

43:13.960 --> 43:15.000
than it is supernatural.

43:19.240 --> 43:21.760
Everett used his right hand
to touch the sarcophagus,

43:21.880 --> 43:24.520
acquiring a thin coating of oil.

43:24.640 --> 43:26.200
And then he shook
hands with Uncle Felix,

43:26.320 --> 43:27.440
passing it on to him.

43:28.520 --> 43:31.000
I'm doing the same
to one of my rats.

43:31.120 --> 43:33.840
[suspenseful music]

43:38.160 --> 43:41.440
[rats squeaking]

43:41.560 --> 43:42.840
There are certain
chemicals known

43:42.960 --> 43:44.560
to have a psychotropic effect

43:44.680 --> 43:46.240
when they enter the bloodstream.

43:47.640 --> 43:48.960
- [Nancy] Which means?

43:50.680 --> 43:53.800
- It makes you see
things. Drives you insane.

43:54.960 --> 43:57.280
Seems very possible to me

43:57.400 --> 43:58.880
that these clever
Egyptians created

43:59.000 --> 44:02.200
some form of powerful
psychotropic formula

44:03.240 --> 44:06.880
and then mixed it with
something, like ground thorns.

44:07.000 --> 44:08.840
Something sharp enough
to pierce the skin,

44:08.960 --> 44:11.520
but small enough that
you'd never feel it.

44:11.640 --> 44:14.320
And then they coated
the sarcophagus with it.

44:14.440 --> 44:15.320
- But-

44:15.440 --> 44:17.240
- Wait, listen.

44:17.360 --> 44:19.520
[rat squeaking]

44:19.640 --> 44:21.440
He's becoming agitated.

44:22.600 --> 44:24.280
I think it's working.

44:24.400 --> 44:26.040
[rat squeaking]

44:26.160 --> 44:27.320
- It's horrible.

44:27.440 --> 44:28.120
Poor thing.

44:28.240 --> 44:29.520
- Yes.

44:29.640 --> 44:31.880
Right now he's
experiencing pure terror

44:32.000 --> 44:33.600
and then his body will
release adrenaline,

44:33.720 --> 44:35.720
too much for the
heart to cope with.

44:35.840 --> 44:37.640
It's only a matter
of time before

44:43.960 --> 44:46.920
[suspenseful music]

44:52.240 --> 44:53.120
he's dead.

44:53.240 --> 44:55.240
[suspenseful music]

44:55.360 --> 44:57.480
- Is that what happened
to Dr. Randolph?

44:57.600 --> 44:58.240
- I'm afraid so.

45:01.640 --> 45:03.040
Now we've just got to...

45:05.640 --> 45:06.240
- What is it?

45:06.360 --> 45:09.520
[suspenseful music]

45:10.600 --> 45:11.920
- Oh God.

45:12.040 --> 45:14.720
I am so stupid.
So bloody stupid.

45:14.840 --> 45:15.560
- What is it, Archie?

45:15.680 --> 45:17.360
- The oil.

45:17.480 --> 45:20.080
If it can penetrate the skin,
it can penetrate leather.

45:20.200 --> 45:23.000
[suspenseful music]

45:26.520 --> 45:31.400
[bright suspenseful music]
[bells clanging]

45:34.280 --> 45:35.360
- I'm dead.

45:36.680 --> 45:38.400
- Spare any change, mister?

45:39.200 --> 45:40.120
- You what?

45:40.240 --> 45:41.760
- Spare any change?

45:41.880 --> 45:43.600
- Does it look like
I've got money to waste?

45:43.720 --> 45:45.600
- Looks like you
got more than me.

45:45.720 --> 45:47.680
Least you ain't
begging in the streets.

45:47.800 --> 45:49.920
- Yeah, well, give it time.

45:50.040 --> 45:51.920
I might be by tomorrow.

45:53.040 --> 45:54.760
- Come on, mister, just a penny.

45:55.640 --> 45:57.160
I'll work for it.

45:57.280 --> 45:58.760
I'll do anything for a penny.

45:58.880 --> 46:00.640
- All right, I'll
think about it.

46:01.640 --> 46:03.200
- I'm always here, mister.

46:03.320 --> 46:04.760
Day or night.

46:04.880 --> 46:06.520
Just ask around for Shelly.

46:06.640 --> 46:08.520
[suspenseful music]

46:08.640 --> 46:11.000
- That's it, Nancy.
As tight as you can.

46:12.600 --> 46:15.840
If I start thrashing around,
I'm liable to injure myself.

46:15.960 --> 46:17.080
- What else can I do?

46:18.080 --> 46:19.400
- Just watch over me.

46:19.520 --> 46:21.200
[suspenseful music]

46:21.320 --> 46:24.280
If I go into a trance,
you'll have to wake me.

46:24.400 --> 46:25.280
- How?

46:25.400 --> 46:26.880
- Do whatever it takes.

46:27.000 --> 46:29.480
It won't be easy, but it's
the only way to save my life.

46:30.600 --> 46:32.600
You'll need to wake me before
the adrenaline in my system

46:32.720 --> 46:34.840
starts to overstimulate
my heart and...

46:36.080 --> 46:37.040
Nancy?

46:39.200 --> 46:40.280
Oh God.

46:41.360 --> 46:42.720
Okay.

46:42.840 --> 46:45.840
Whatever you see,
Archie, it is not real.

46:45.960 --> 46:47.920
[suspenseful music]

46:48.040 --> 46:50.840
[creature growling]

46:50.960 --> 46:53.960
[suspenseful music]

46:57.640 --> 46:58.880
Oh Lord!

46:59.000 --> 47:03.680
[suspenseful music]
[creature growling]

47:05.680 --> 47:07.680
No!

47:07.800 --> 47:09.680
No, no, no, my heart! No!

47:10.680 --> 47:11.640
No!

47:12.680 --> 47:14.200
No, not my heart.

47:15.160 --> 47:18.200
[Archie panting]

47:19.800 --> 47:20.880
- Are you alright?

47:22.400 --> 47:24.440
- I think so.
[uplifting music]

47:24.560 --> 47:25.840
My heart is pounding.

47:27.040 --> 47:28.720
- You make me feel the same way.

47:28.840 --> 47:31.920
[uplifting music]

47:32.040 --> 47:33.480
- You did it, Nancy.

47:34.320 --> 47:35.960
You saved my life.

47:36.080 --> 47:38.920
[uplifting music]

47:44.120 --> 47:45.520
- I knew it.
[bright suspenseful music]

47:45.640 --> 47:48.640
I knew there was something
going on between the two of you.

47:48.760 --> 47:51.040
I didn't have you down
as the kinky sort though.

47:51.160 --> 47:52.640
You oughta watch her, Archie.

47:52.760 --> 47:54.080
She'll have you wearing
her dresses next.

47:54.200 --> 47:55.440
I know the type.

47:55.560 --> 47:57.320
- Shut up and come
and help untie me.

47:57.440 --> 47:58.640
I've just been through

47:58.760 --> 48:00.600
the same thing you
and Uncle Felix have.

48:00.720 --> 48:02.400
- [Everett] You've
been cursed or what?

48:02.520 --> 48:04.080
- It's not a curse.

48:04.200 --> 48:07.040
[melancholy music]

48:07.840 --> 48:09.640
It's a psychotropic chemical.

48:11.920 --> 48:13.960
It gets under your skin

48:14.080 --> 48:17.160
and it makes you see things.

48:18.240 --> 48:19.720
Terrible things.

48:21.080 --> 48:22.960
And then your body starts
to produce adrenaline,

48:23.080 --> 48:24.440
too much for the
heart to cope with.

48:24.560 --> 48:28.440
And you die unless someone
can snap you out of it.

48:28.560 --> 48:30.320
- And how did you work that out?

48:30.440 --> 48:31.800
- Science.

48:32.480 --> 48:34.080
Science and research.

48:34.200 --> 48:37.640
It's what I do. And
Nancy assists me.

48:37.760 --> 48:38.720
- I bet she does.

48:38.840 --> 48:41.160
[uplifting music]

48:41.280 --> 48:42.880
- [Archie] This is the stuff.

48:43.000 --> 48:44.880
- Oh, be careful, Archie.

48:45.000 --> 48:47.120
- I've never seen
anything quite like it.

48:48.120 --> 48:50.200
This could be a very
valuable discovery.

48:50.320 --> 48:51.560
[uplifting music]

48:51.680 --> 48:52.440
- Valuable?

48:53.360 --> 48:55.760
- To the scientific community.

48:55.880 --> 48:57.920
A valuable source of knowledge.

48:59.040 --> 49:00.280
- And there was me thinking

49:00.400 --> 49:02.560
that maybe we could
bottle it up and sell it.

49:02.680 --> 49:03.600
[uplifting music]

49:03.720 --> 49:05.040
Bloody hell, Archie,

49:05.160 --> 49:06.160
there's gotta be
some way of getting

49:06.280 --> 49:07.680
some sort of value
out of this thing.

49:07.800 --> 49:10.360
[uplifting music]

49:13.920 --> 49:16.200
Look, I'm gonna level
with you, Archie.

49:17.280 --> 49:19.960
I need to find a way of
making some money fast.

49:21.560 --> 49:24.920
- Well, we'll have to
sell the house eventually.

49:25.040 --> 49:25.680
- No, no, no.

49:25.800 --> 49:27.320
Not eventually, Archie.

49:27.440 --> 49:28.760
Now. Okay?

49:28.880 --> 49:31.520
See, I owe a lot of money.

49:31.640 --> 49:35.320
And if I don't find a way of
making this money by tomorrow,

49:37.480 --> 49:41.120
I'm dead.
[melancholy music]

49:41.240 --> 49:44.520
- Look, I don't
know what to say.

49:46.720 --> 49:49.760
Making money has never
really been my strong suit.

49:50.400 --> 49:51.720
Even Nancy and I are worried

49:51.840 --> 49:54.400
about how we'll manage
with Uncle Felix gone.

49:54.520 --> 49:58.200
- You're bloody useless.
The pair of you are useless.

49:58.320 --> 49:59.720
I don't even know why
I'm talking to you.

49:59.840 --> 50:02.480
[melancholy music]

50:09.480 --> 50:10.240
What this?

50:11.920 --> 50:16.040
Live on show tonight,
the Hottentot Venus.

50:16.160 --> 50:17.760
- I've heard about that.

50:17.880 --> 50:19.200
It's terribly cruel.

50:19.320 --> 50:22.200
Some poor African woman they've
put on show half undressed

50:22.320 --> 50:23.480
for people to gawk at.

50:23.600 --> 50:26.720
- Tickets are
thruppence a piece.

50:27.680 --> 50:29.160
They've gotta be raking it in,

50:29.280 --> 50:31.840
just to see this African woman

50:32.720 --> 50:34.360
- I've seen her actually.

50:36.120 --> 50:37.080
- You have?

50:37.800 --> 50:40.560
- Oh, it was with the Academy.

50:40.680 --> 50:45.240
All of us went for
educational purposes.

50:45.360 --> 50:46.600
- [Nancy] It's no more
than a freak show.

50:46.720 --> 50:49.240
- She has very unusual
physical characteristics.

50:49.360 --> 50:50.880
- That's a polite
way of saying it.

50:52.760 --> 50:54.160
I've got to get the dinner on.

50:59.720 --> 51:04.560
[rain whooshing]
[suspenseful music]

51:17.680 --> 51:18.920
- What are you thinking?

51:21.240 --> 51:22.440
- If they're willing
to play thruppence

51:22.560 --> 51:24.800
to see some woman from Africa,

51:26.480 --> 51:27.720
what would they
be willing to pay

51:27.840 --> 51:30.560
to see an actual ancient
Egyptian princess?

51:32.280 --> 51:36.920
- Everett, you can't put
a dead body on display.

51:37.040 --> 51:39.760
Even if it is a
thousand-year-old dead princess.

51:40.720 --> 51:44.200
- I'm not talking
about a dead princess.

51:44.320 --> 51:45.800
I'm talking about a live one.

51:48.320 --> 51:49.360
- I'm sorry? What?

51:49.480 --> 51:51.040
- Think about it, Archie.

51:51.160 --> 51:55.440
A living, breathing historical
artifact from far-off Egypt.

51:56.320 --> 51:57.400
I mean, forget thruppence.

51:57.520 --> 51:58.880
We could charge a pound pop

51:59.000 --> 52:01.000
and they'll still be
lining the streets outside.

52:02.600 --> 52:04.560
It's possible to
restart a heart, yeah?

52:04.680 --> 52:07.720
You said that someone
over in Finland did it.

52:07.840 --> 52:08.400
- Luxembourg.

52:10.200 --> 52:12.600
And in that case, the patient
had been dead for 30 minutes,

52:12.720 --> 52:14.400
not 4,000 years.

52:14.520 --> 52:15.880
- What difference does it make?

52:16.000 --> 52:17.000
Yeah, dead is dead.

52:17.120 --> 52:19.360
As long as all the
parts are in good nick.

52:20.440 --> 52:22.480
- This is ridiculous.
It's unthinkable.

52:22.600 --> 52:24.680
- But it worked with
the rats, didn't it?

52:24.800 --> 52:25.560
How did you do that?

52:28.560 --> 52:31.240
- Well, I gave them a
large shot of adrenaline.

52:32.480 --> 52:35.880
But rats are much simpler
beings than humans.

52:36.000 --> 52:38.400
There's the higher brain
function to consider.

52:38.520 --> 52:41.400
Even if we could
get her body going,

52:41.520 --> 52:44.040
who's to say what condition
the mind would be in.

52:44.160 --> 52:44.920
- I mean, you've gotta admit,

52:45.040 --> 52:46.400
it's an intriguing idea.

52:50.320 --> 52:51.520
And if it worked,

52:52.640 --> 52:54.960
it would definitely make
your name as a doctor.

52:56.160 --> 52:58.000
I mean, Archie, you'd
be world famous.

52:58.120 --> 52:59.400
The man that conquered death!

53:01.240 --> 53:04.120
And you and Nancy would
never need to worry

53:04.240 --> 53:05.600
about money ever again.

53:05.720 --> 53:07.320
[rain whooshing]
[suspenseful music]

53:07.440 --> 53:09.680
- And neither would
you, I suppose.

53:09.800 --> 53:11.840
- I'd only want my
fair share, Archie.

53:11.960 --> 53:14.360
- And how much is
your fair share,

53:14.480 --> 53:17.080
considering I'd be
doing most of the work?

53:17.200 --> 53:18.680
- So you are considering it?

53:19.920 --> 53:22.920
- Look, Everett,
it's not that simple.

53:23.040 --> 53:25.000
The body ought to be
perfectly preserved,

53:25.120 --> 53:28.800
but what if the mummification
processes failed?

53:28.920 --> 53:32.160
Or the organs, what if
they're all putrified?

53:33.200 --> 53:35.520
- Let's get her out and
have a proper look then.

53:35.640 --> 53:36.800
- Right now?

53:36.920 --> 53:38.680
- There's no time like
the present, Archie.

53:39.800 --> 53:42.200
And I did say that I was
in a bit of a hurry, so...

53:42.320 --> 53:44.360
[eerie music]
[rain whooshing]

53:44.480 --> 53:46.840
- All right, but we
have to do this quickly.

53:47.960 --> 53:49.640
I don't want Nancy to
know about any of this.

53:49.760 --> 53:51.440
She'd be appalled at the idea.

53:51.560 --> 53:52.640
- How do you know?

53:52.760 --> 53:55.040
- Because I'm
appalled at the idea.

53:55.160 --> 53:58.640
- But you are intrigued by
the possibility, aren't you?

53:58.760 --> 54:00.600
- Against my better judgment.

54:01.880 --> 54:04.800
It must be that sense
of adventure Felix
always spoke about.

54:06.240 --> 54:09.000
[rain whooshing]

54:10.280 --> 54:12.760
[door rumbling]

54:16.720 --> 54:19.440
I dunno why I keep closing this.

54:19.560 --> 54:21.600
I only end up opening
it back up again.

54:22.480 --> 54:24.160
- Do you want a hand with it?

54:24.280 --> 54:25.640
- Grab the chisel.

54:25.760 --> 54:27.440
[bright suspenseful music]

54:27.560 --> 54:29.920
[wood creaks]

54:46.400 --> 54:48.440
And now for the fun part.

54:56.040 --> 54:57.960
Let's crack it open.

54:58.080 --> 55:00.000
[bright suspenseful music]

55:00.120 --> 55:02.800
[chisel tapping]

55:06.240 --> 55:08.920
[metal clanks]

55:10.040 --> 55:14.240
[bright suspenseful music]

55:14.360 --> 55:16.640
- Come on then, let's
have a proper look at her.

55:17.760 --> 55:20.320
Too dark to see anything
in that basement.

55:20.440 --> 55:22.240
- I wouldn't get your
hopes up, Everett.

55:23.600 --> 55:24.960
[eerie music]

55:25.080 --> 55:25.840
- Giddy aunt.

55:29.880 --> 55:31.360
You know, I'm starting to think

55:31.480 --> 55:33.440
that people'd actually pay
just to see her like this.

55:34.520 --> 55:36.800
- Well, she won't stay
like this for long.

55:37.840 --> 55:39.760
See, the sarcophagus
was sealed airtight.

55:39.880 --> 55:41.640
Now that she's
out in the oxygen,

55:41.760 --> 55:44.200
her body's going
to start to atrophy

55:44.320 --> 55:46.000
unless I can get
her blood moving.

55:46.120 --> 55:46.880
And then...

55:49.640 --> 55:50.600
- What?

55:52.520 --> 55:53.560
- It's no use, Everett.

55:53.680 --> 55:55.440
This is never going to work.

55:56.520 --> 55:57.800
In the case in Luxembourg,

55:57.920 --> 55:59.920
the patient had only
been dead for 30 minutes.

56:00.040 --> 56:01.480
- But I thought
we agreed that...

56:01.600 --> 56:03.200
- The purpose of blood
is to carry oxygen

56:03.320 --> 56:05.000
to all of the internal organs.

56:05.120 --> 56:06.800
- If you say so.

56:06.920 --> 56:09.560
- Blood is oxygenated from the
lungs breathing in and out.

56:09.680 --> 56:12.440
Well, after 4,000
years in a sarcophagus,

56:12.560 --> 56:14.640
any blood that
remains in her body,

56:15.640 --> 56:18.160
well, it's not going to
have any oxygen in it.

56:20.360 --> 56:21.520
Before we start her heart,

56:21.640 --> 56:23.480
we're going to have to
do a blood transfusion.

56:23.600 --> 56:24.840
[eerie music]
[rain whooshing]

56:24.960 --> 56:26.600
- What's that mean?

56:26.720 --> 56:28.560
- It means we're
going to need blood.

56:29.760 --> 56:34.720
Fresh blood from a living,
breathing human volunteer.

56:35.600 --> 56:36.600
- Well, don't look at me.

56:36.720 --> 56:38.640
- Well, do you want
to do this or not?

56:38.760 --> 56:39.960
- Yeah, of course.

56:40.080 --> 56:41.000
- Then we need to
do it by tonight,

56:41.120 --> 56:42.640
before the body starts to decay.

56:48.800 --> 56:49.920
- I've got an idea.

56:50.040 --> 56:51.240
[suspenseful music]
[rain whooshing]

56:51.360 --> 56:52.760
Have you got a
penny I can borrow?

56:58.760 --> 57:01.560
- Whatever for?
[coin clinks]

57:01.680 --> 57:03.040
- Wait and see, Archie.

57:03.160 --> 57:04.800
Wait and see.

57:04.920 --> 57:06.560
Look, I need to nip out.

57:06.680 --> 57:08.400
I'll be back later tonight.

57:08.520 --> 57:09.320
- You're going out?

57:09.440 --> 57:10.560
But we need to open her up.

57:10.680 --> 57:12.120
We need to check the
condition of her organs.

57:12.240 --> 57:15.400
- Oh Christ. You don't need
me to help you with that.

57:15.520 --> 57:17.280
- No, I suppose not.

57:18.720 --> 57:20.680
But it is going
to take some time.

57:20.800 --> 57:24.120
I have to put everything back
exactly where I found it.

57:24.240 --> 57:28.800
- Well, you better get on
with it then, hadn't you?

57:31.200 --> 57:32.160
I'll

57:34.520 --> 57:35.720
see you later.

57:39.400 --> 57:42.480
[rain pattering]

57:42.600 --> 57:47.520
[thunder rumbles]
[rain whooshing]

57:52.480 --> 57:53.200
- [Archie] I'm sorry-

57:53.320 --> 57:54.280
- It doesn't matter.

57:54.960 --> 57:57.280
- No, I mean about Everett.

57:59.160 --> 58:02.240
Everett's always
been a bit difficult.

58:02.360 --> 58:04.800
[melancholy music]

58:04.920 --> 58:06.560
But having seen the way the
family have treated him,

58:06.680 --> 58:08.800
I can hardly blame him.

58:08.920 --> 58:11.200
- I can hardly believe the
two of you are related.

58:13.240 --> 58:15.920
- Well, we might
not be actually.

58:17.040 --> 58:20.080
Rumor at the time was that
Everett's father, my uncle,

58:21.480 --> 58:23.960
was not actually his father,

58:24.080 --> 58:25.600
if you know what I mean.

58:27.600 --> 58:29.960
It was a big
scandal at the time.

58:30.080 --> 58:31.720
Tarnished the family name.
[melancholy music]

58:31.840 --> 58:33.840
So the entire family
shunned Everett.

58:36.040 --> 58:37.480
- I see.

58:37.600 --> 58:40.200
- Plus his father was
an inveterate gambler.

58:41.200 --> 58:43.240
He lost fortunes at
the card tables so

58:45.760 --> 58:48.000
Everett had to make his
own way in the world.

58:49.120 --> 58:53.400
- And is the family name
still important to you?

58:55.080 --> 58:57.280
- What do you mean?
[melancholy music]

58:57.400 --> 59:00.160
- If people found
out about you and me,

59:01.720 --> 59:03.120
would you be ashamed of me?

59:04.800 --> 59:06.560
- No. Of course not.

59:06.680 --> 59:09.480
[melancholy music]

59:09.600 --> 59:11.120
But you know how people are.

59:12.960 --> 59:17.480
- It still feels funny sitting
at this table with you,

59:17.600 --> 59:19.560
instead of eating by
myself in the kitchen.

59:21.200 --> 59:23.240
I do miss Dr. Randolph,

59:23.360 --> 59:26.160
but it's so nice just to
be myself around the house

59:26.280 --> 59:28.280
instead of keeping
everything secret.

59:28.400 --> 59:31.240
[melancholy music]

59:32.640 --> 59:34.200
What is it, Archie?

59:34.320 --> 59:35.040
Is something wrong?

59:38.800 --> 59:41.440
- I have never kept
secrets, Nancy.

59:41.560 --> 59:42.600
Not from you, I mean.

59:42.720 --> 59:44.200
- I know that, Archie.

59:45.840 --> 59:48.560
- So if I asked you to
trust me, would you?

59:50.480 --> 59:53.760
- What are you getting at?
[melancholy music]

59:53.880 --> 59:56.360
- Me and Everett, we're
working on something.

59:56.480 --> 59:59.320
- Oh no. What has
he talked you into?

59:59.440 --> 1:00:02.160
- It's something that
could be incredible.

1:00:02.920 --> 1:00:04.440
It could be fantastic.

1:00:05.800 --> 1:00:08.160
It could solve all
of our problems.

1:00:09.800 --> 1:00:10.760
Or...

1:00:12.560 --> 1:00:14.640
- Or what?

1:00:14.760 --> 1:00:17.320
- Or it could be a
horrible nightmare.

1:00:18.840 --> 1:00:21.040
And for that reason,
after dinner, Nancy,

1:00:21.160 --> 1:00:24.520
I want you to go to your room
and stay there until morning.

1:00:24.640 --> 1:00:26.520
Do not come out, no
matter what you hear.

1:00:26.640 --> 1:00:28.640
- What on earth are
you talking about?

1:00:28.760 --> 1:00:30.440
- Please, Nancy.

1:00:30.560 --> 1:00:31.800
Promise me.

1:00:31.920 --> 1:00:33.920
- But what if you
get into trouble?

1:00:34.040 --> 1:00:36.280
Is it something to do
with that sarcophagus?

1:00:37.760 --> 1:00:39.520
- No. No.
[suspenseful music]

1:00:39.640 --> 1:00:41.240
We won't be going
near that again.

1:00:42.520 --> 1:00:43.880
- I still don't like
the sound of this.

1:00:44.000 --> 1:00:45.440
[suspenseful music]
[rain pattering]

1:00:45.560 --> 1:00:46.920
- I know.

1:00:47.040 --> 1:00:48.240
And I knew you wouldn't,

1:00:49.880 --> 1:00:51.120
but I have to try this.

1:00:52.360 --> 1:00:54.200
And if it does work,

1:00:55.920 --> 1:00:58.080
we'd never have to
worry about money again.

1:01:01.640 --> 1:01:02.640
- All right, Archie.

1:01:03.440 --> 1:01:04.440
I trust you.

1:01:05.280 --> 1:01:07.080
But I don't trust your cousin.

1:01:07.200 --> 1:01:08.400
- Neither do I.

1:01:09.520 --> 1:01:12.520
But I don't think I can
do this without him.

1:01:12.640 --> 1:01:15.880

1:01:19.600 --> 1:01:20.560
Remember what I said.

1:01:22.200 --> 1:01:24.120
Stay in your room tonight.

1:01:24.240 --> 1:01:26.160
We'll know if we've
succeeded by the morning.

1:01:26.280 --> 1:01:28.360
- It isn't something
dangerous, is it?

1:01:28.480 --> 1:01:29.200
- I don't know.

1:01:29.320 --> 1:01:30.000
I don't think so.

1:01:31.600 --> 1:01:34.240
- And you're sure Everett
isn't forcing you?

1:01:34.360 --> 1:01:36.800
- I'll admit, he can
be very persuasive.

1:01:40.440 --> 1:01:43.880
If at any time I don't feel
like I'm doing the right thing,

1:01:44.000 --> 1:01:45.360
I'll put a stop to it.

1:01:45.480 --> 1:01:46.400
All right?

1:01:49.840 --> 1:01:53.240
[bright suspenseful music]

1:02:09.600 --> 1:02:11.560
Why did they do this to you?

[bright suspenseful music]

- [Felix Voiceover]
So there it was,

1:03:21.680 --> 1:03:23.360
the truth about Khenmetptah.

1:03:26.040 --> 1:03:28.720
There was no other such
case in recorded history,

1:03:31.240 --> 1:03:33.960
making my find
absolutely unique.

1:03:35.760 --> 1:03:38.440
Unique, and yet so grim

1:03:38.560 --> 1:03:41.840
I feared no museum would
ever dare exhibit it.

1:03:43.640 --> 1:03:48.640

1:03:51.000 --> 1:03:53.400

1:03:56.880 --> 1:03:58.400
- This is a nice house.

1:03:58.520 --> 1:03:59.440
Is it yours?

1:04:00.080 --> 1:04:02.320
- No.

1:04:02.440 --> 1:04:03.440
Not yet.

[eerie music]
[rain whooshing]

1:04:06.720 --> 1:04:09.840
- What is it that you
want me to do then?

1:04:11.840 --> 1:04:13.560
- Look, I've already said.

1:04:13.680 --> 1:04:15.480
It's hard to explain.

1:04:15.600 --> 1:04:20.440
[eerie music]
[rain pattering]

1:04:27.240 --> 1:04:30.000
Archie, this is Shelly.

1:04:30.120 --> 1:04:32.480
Our healthy volunteer.

1:04:32.600 --> 1:04:33.920
- Pleased to meet you, Archie.

1:04:34.040 --> 1:04:35.720
- Thank you for
agreeing to come.

1:04:35.840 --> 1:04:37.560
- So how's it going?

1:04:38.720 --> 1:04:39.640
- Fine.

1:04:40.760 --> 1:04:41.920
- How were the innards?

1:04:43.400 --> 1:04:44.640
- Fine.

1:04:44.760 --> 1:04:47.480
Well, rather
extraordinary, actually.

1:04:47.600 --> 1:04:49.280
- So we're in business then.

1:04:49.400 --> 1:04:50.520
- Look, Everett,

1:04:50.640 --> 1:04:52.280
I've been reading
Uncle Felix's journal.

1:04:52.400 --> 1:04:54.320
There's some more information
here regarding our-

1:04:54.440 --> 1:04:55.760
- It sounds beautiful.

1:04:55.880 --> 1:04:57.440
Maybe you could tell
me about that later.

1:04:57.560 --> 1:04:59.760
- Sorry to interrupt
you two gentlemen,

1:05:01.040 --> 1:05:03.280
but what is it exactly
that you wanted me to do?

1:05:05.440 --> 1:05:08.080
- You haven't told
her why she's here?

1:05:08.200 --> 1:05:10.720
- Well, I thought it would
be better coming from you.

1:05:10.840 --> 1:05:11.520
- God.

1:05:11.640 --> 1:05:12.520
All right.

1:05:12.640 --> 1:05:13.480
Shelly, is it?

1:05:16.120 --> 1:05:17.880
Why don't you lay on the bed?

1:05:18.840 --> 1:05:21.400
[bright suspenseful music]

1:05:21.520 --> 1:05:22.320
- I knew it.

1:05:23.400 --> 1:05:25.480
With the two of
you at once, is it?

1:05:25.600 --> 1:05:27.000
- No, no, no, no, no.

1:05:27.120 --> 1:05:28.880
- You got me here
under false pretenses.

1:05:29.000 --> 1:05:30.640
- You did say that you would
do anything for a penny.

1:05:30.760 --> 1:05:32.200
- I didn't mean that.

1:05:32.320 --> 1:05:35.760
I might be a beggar,
but I'm not a whore!

1:05:35.880 --> 1:05:39.560
- If I may, all we need
is some of your blood.

1:05:39.680 --> 1:05:43.200
[bright suspenseful music]

1:05:47.080 --> 1:05:48.640
- What the bleeding
hell is this?

1:05:48.760 --> 1:05:49.600
- Look, we can explain.

1:05:49.720 --> 1:05:52.120
- Help. Help! Police!

1:05:52.240 --> 1:05:53.000
Murder!

1:05:53.880 --> 1:05:54.920
Let me go!

1:05:55.040 --> 1:05:56.560
Get off me! Let me go!

1:05:56.680 --> 1:05:58.040
- Calm down!

1:05:59.080 --> 1:06:01.640
- Get off me! Get off
of me, you murderers!

1:06:01.760 --> 1:06:03.640
[blow thuds]

1:06:03.760 --> 1:06:06.640
[rain whooshing]

1:06:08.360 --> 1:06:11.480
- Well, this is just great.

1:06:11.600 --> 1:06:12.360
- Hold on.

1:06:14.720 --> 1:06:16.600
It's all right.

1:06:16.720 --> 1:06:18.040
She's just out cold.

1:06:18.160 --> 1:06:19.720
- This is not right, Everett.

1:06:19.840 --> 1:06:20.920
This is awful.

1:06:21.040 --> 1:06:21.880
- Come on.

1:06:22.000 --> 1:06:22.760
Help me get her up on the bed.

1:06:22.880 --> 1:06:24.200
- I promised Nancy that if,

1:06:24.320 --> 1:06:25.920
at any point, I felt
uncomfortable with this,

1:06:26.040 --> 1:06:27.400
I would put a stop to it.

1:06:27.520 --> 1:06:28.640
- Oh yeah?

1:06:28.760 --> 1:06:30.880
- In any case, the girl
will never agree to it.

1:06:31.000 --> 1:06:32.840
- Well, she doesn't
have to now, does she?

1:06:32.960 --> 1:06:35.840
You can just do your thing.

1:06:35.960 --> 1:06:38.160
- While she's unconscious?

1:06:38.280 --> 1:06:40.720
That is entirely unethical.

1:06:40.840 --> 1:06:42.760
Nevermind dangerous!

1:06:42.880 --> 1:06:45.240
How would we know if we've
taken too much blood?

1:06:45.360 --> 1:06:47.160
This whole thing is
becoming intolerable.

1:06:47.280 --> 1:06:50.400
[suspenseful music]

1:06:52.400 --> 1:06:53.280
- Is it?

1:06:54.240 --> 1:06:56.240
- Yes, it is.

1:06:57.240 --> 1:06:59.880
And I haven't even told
you the worst of it.

1:07:00.000 --> 1:07:01.440
Has it never even
occurred to you

1:07:01.560 --> 1:07:04.200
as to why the princess was
interred at such a young age?

1:07:04.320 --> 1:07:05.440
How she died?

1:07:05.560 --> 1:07:07.680
- No, Archie, it
didn't occur to me.

1:07:07.800 --> 1:07:10.440
And, what's more, I don't care.

1:07:10.560 --> 1:07:13.080
But if you are thinking
of backing out on me,

1:07:13.200 --> 1:07:14.880
I got news for you.

1:07:15.760 --> 1:07:17.440
While I was out,

1:07:17.560 --> 1:07:19.320
I popped in to see my pal
over at the newspaper.

1:07:20.400 --> 1:07:22.400
He was delighted when I
gave him this little tip

1:07:22.520 --> 1:07:25.880
about this young heir
from a well-to-do family

1:07:26.000 --> 1:07:28.360
who's been caught having his
wicked way with the maid.

1:07:29.560 --> 1:07:32.320
You know how much the
press love a scandal.

1:07:33.360 --> 1:07:35.120
Especially when it
involves a Randolph.

1:07:36.360 --> 1:07:38.000
- They're going to print that?

1:07:39.280 --> 1:07:40.880
- Not if I put a stop to it. No.

1:07:43.040 --> 1:07:43.600
- What?

1:07:45.320 --> 1:07:46.520
- They call it a
dead-man's switch, Archie.

1:07:46.640 --> 1:07:47.800
Every day I go into the office,

1:07:47.920 --> 1:07:49.200
I tell 'em to put an
hold on the story.

1:07:49.320 --> 1:07:51.920
But when that day comes that
I don't show up, well...

1:07:52.760 --> 1:07:53.960
It goes to print.

1:07:54.080 --> 1:07:57.080
[suspenseful music]

1:07:57.200 --> 1:07:59.840
We're doing this, Archie,
whether you like it or not.

1:07:59.960 --> 1:08:02.960
[suspenseful music]

1:08:03.960 --> 1:08:07.760
[thunder rumbling]
[rain whooshing]

1:08:07.880 --> 1:08:10.520
[eerie music]

1:08:17.600 --> 1:08:19.040
- There.

1:08:19.160 --> 1:08:20.720
The transfusion has begun.

1:08:22.520 --> 1:08:24.720
- So how long is
this gonna take then?

1:08:24.840 --> 1:08:26.560
- Well, the average person

1:08:26.680 --> 1:08:28.360
has about eight pints
of blood in their body.

1:08:28.480 --> 1:08:31.280
Now, that's what carries
oxygen to all of the organs.

1:08:31.400 --> 1:08:33.600
Naturally, we can't
take all eight pints.

1:08:33.720 --> 1:08:34.480
- Why's that?

1:08:36.440 --> 1:08:37.200
- She would die.

1:08:38.280 --> 1:08:40.800
- Right.

1:08:40.920 --> 1:08:42.400
- All we need is enough

1:08:42.520 --> 1:08:43.880
to get the heart pumping
the blood around the body.

1:08:44.000 --> 1:08:45.840
And then once the
organs start to work,

1:08:45.960 --> 1:08:47.120
the princess's body will start

1:08:47.240 --> 1:08:48.880
to generate its
own blood supply.

1:08:49.000 --> 1:08:52.680
- And how do we know when
we've got enough blood?

1:08:54.320 --> 1:08:56.280
- I have no idea.

1:08:56.400 --> 1:08:57.640
To be honest, this
is all guesswork.

1:08:57.760 --> 1:08:59.080
- Guesswork?

1:08:59.200 --> 1:09:00.440
I thought you was
meant to be a doctor.

1:09:00.560 --> 1:09:02.920
- This isn't exactly
what doctors do, Everett.

1:09:04.480 --> 1:09:07.160
- So what happens
after this blood trans-

1:09:07.280 --> 1:09:09.360
- Well, there comes
the hard part.

1:09:09.480 --> 1:09:11.000
We need adrenaline.

1:09:11.120 --> 1:09:13.360
I've only ever
done that on rats.

1:09:13.480 --> 1:09:14.200
- Done what?

1:09:14.320 --> 1:09:15.600
- Extracted it.

1:09:15.720 --> 1:09:16.480
Pure adrenaline.

1:09:18.080 --> 1:09:21.960
4,000-year-old heart, it's
going need a rather large dose.

1:09:22.080 --> 1:09:24.800
Now the body only creates
it under certain conditions.

1:09:27.320 --> 1:09:28.920
- When they're scared, right?

1:09:29.040 --> 1:09:30.760
See, I was listening.

1:09:30.880 --> 1:09:33.560
- And I was never exactly
sure on how we were going to-

1:09:34.480 --> 1:09:37.040
[woman gasping]

1:09:39.960 --> 1:09:42.120
- Is she waking up?

1:09:42.240 --> 1:09:44.200
- No, she looks too weak.

1:09:44.320 --> 1:09:45.600
[woman gasping]

1:09:45.720 --> 1:09:47.520
Shelly, Shelly, wake up!

1:09:47.640 --> 1:09:48.600
Shelly!

1:09:49.560 --> 1:09:51.720
[woman groans]

1:09:51.840 --> 1:09:52.640
- [Everett] What are you doing?

1:09:52.760 --> 1:09:53.400
- She's losing too much blood.

1:09:53.520 --> 1:09:54.960
I've got to turn it off.

1:09:55.080 --> 1:09:56.720
- What if it's not enough
blood to wake up the princess?

1:09:56.840 --> 1:09:58.320
- Everett, she's going to die.

1:09:58.440 --> 1:10:00.560
- Leave it a bit longer.

1:10:00.680 --> 1:10:03.480
[Shelly gasping]
[suspenseful music]

1:10:03.600 --> 1:10:05.720
I said leave it.

[Shelly gasping]

1:10:08.560 --> 1:10:11.120
[ominous music]

1:10:22.920 --> 1:10:23.480
- She's dead.

1:10:27.040 --> 1:10:28.440
This is over.

1:10:28.560 --> 1:10:30.920
- Nah, it's not over
until I say it is.

1:10:31.040 --> 1:10:32.760
- A girl has died.
[dramatic music]

1:10:32.880 --> 1:10:35.720
- Well better her than me.

1:10:35.840 --> 1:10:38.760

[men grunting]
[suspenseful music]

1:10:40.360 --> 1:10:41.160
- What's going on?

1:10:43.200 --> 1:10:44.280
- Nancy, I told you
not to come down.

1:10:44.400 --> 1:10:46.400
- How could I stay upstairs

1:10:46.520 --> 1:10:48.560
with all the crashing
and the screaming and...

1:10:48.680 --> 1:10:49.520
Get back.

1:10:51.600 --> 1:10:54.120
Archie, what's going on?

1:10:54.240 --> 1:10:56.280
- It's okay, Nancy.

1:10:56.400 --> 1:10:57.520
It's over now.

1:10:57.640 --> 1:10:59.880
[suspenseful music]

1:11:00.000 --> 1:11:02.160
[Nancy gasps]

1:11:03.800 --> 1:11:05.960
- It's not over, Archie.

1:11:06.080 --> 1:11:07.520
Not by a long shot.

1:11:09.200 --> 1:11:12.360
Now, we've got Egyptian
princess over there

1:11:12.480 --> 1:11:13.480
full of fresh blood.

1:11:14.520 --> 1:11:16.520
And you are gonna
restart her heart.

1:11:16.640 --> 1:11:17.320
[suspenseful music]

1:11:17.440 --> 1:11:19.040
- Everett, I can't.

1:11:19.160 --> 1:11:21.360
Not now that Shelly's dead.

1:11:21.480 --> 1:11:23.520
I can't extract
adrenaline from a corpse.

1:11:23.640 --> 1:11:25.400
I need a working adrenal gland.

1:11:26.520 --> 1:11:29.080
- I suppose we're gonna
need a new volunteer.

1:11:29.200 --> 1:11:30.440
- No, no, I won't do it.

1:11:30.560 --> 1:11:32.200
I don't care if
you blackmail me.

1:11:32.320 --> 1:11:33.640
- Well, if you don't do it,

1:11:33.760 --> 1:11:37.000
then your little maid here
is gonna get a little bullet

1:11:37.120 --> 1:11:38.760
in the back of her little head.

1:11:38.880 --> 1:11:41.880
[suspenseful music]

1:11:43.600 --> 1:11:44.560
There's a chair.

1:11:45.600 --> 1:11:47.600
Now tie her up nice and tight.

1:11:47.720 --> 1:11:50.680
[suspenseful music]

1:11:53.040 --> 1:11:55.160
- I'm so sorry, Nancy.

1:11:55.280 --> 1:11:56.920
- Don't worry, Archie.

1:11:57.040 --> 1:11:57.760
I'm not scared.

1:11:59.600 --> 1:12:01.760
- You say you're not scared, eh?

1:12:01.880 --> 1:12:03.920
Well I just won't do, will it?

1:12:04.040 --> 1:12:06.640
That won't get the old
adrenaline pumping.

1:12:06.760 --> 1:12:09.360
But luckily I've got something

1:12:09.480 --> 1:12:11.320
that will help us
along with that.

1:12:11.440 --> 1:12:13.960
[suspenseful music]

1:12:14.080 --> 1:12:16.240
- [Archie] No!
It's too dangerous.

1:12:16.360 --> 1:12:17.520
- But it works, doesn't it?

1:12:17.640 --> 1:12:19.200
You said so yourself.

1:12:19.320 --> 1:12:20.480
A little bit of this
on the skin will soon

1:12:20.600 --> 1:12:22.200
get those glands
working overtime.

1:12:22.320 --> 1:12:23.280
- Use me instead.

1:12:23.400 --> 1:12:24.080
Put it on me.

1:12:24.200 --> 1:12:25.520
Use my adrenaline.

1:12:25.640 --> 1:12:26.400
- That's very
commendable, that, Archie.

1:12:26.520 --> 1:12:30.000
But who's gonna extract it?

1:12:30.120 --> 1:12:32.280
[suspenseful music]
[rain pattering]

1:12:32.400 --> 1:12:33.440
Get outta the way.

1:12:34.840 --> 1:12:36.520
Just a little bit, Nancy.

1:12:36.640 --> 1:12:37.560
We don't want you
having a attack

1:12:37.680 --> 1:12:39.600
before we're ready now, do we?

1:12:39.720 --> 1:12:41.560
[Nancy gasps]

1:12:41.680 --> 1:12:44.480
[suspenseful music]
[rain pattering]

1:12:44.600 --> 1:12:46.560
- Listen, Nancy,
whatever you see,

1:12:46.680 --> 1:12:48.760
just remember it isn't real.

1:12:48.880 --> 1:12:50.240
- Haven't you got work to do?

1:12:53.720 --> 1:12:54.720
- Jesus!

1:12:54.840 --> 1:12:58.760
[suspenseful music]
[rain pattering]

1:12:58.880 --> 1:13:00.000
- What are you
doing? What's that?

1:13:00.120 --> 1:13:01.640
- An anatomy book.

1:13:01.760 --> 1:13:03.360
I've never done this
on a human before.

1:13:03.480 --> 1:13:04.800
I need to get the location

1:13:04.920 --> 1:13:06.600
of the adrenal
gland exactly right.

1:13:06.720 --> 1:13:10.120
[suspenseful music]

1:13:10.240 --> 1:13:15.200
[Nancy gasping]
[suspenseful music]

1:13:15.760 --> 1:13:16.720
God, it's starting!

1:13:22.240 --> 1:13:24.040
Come over here and
help me, damn it!

1:13:24.160 --> 1:13:25.280
Hold her still.

1:13:25.400 --> 1:13:28.080
[dramatic music]

1:13:46.960 --> 1:13:47.920
- Do it.

1:13:48.040 --> 1:13:50.560
[dramatic music]

1:13:55.600 --> 1:13:58.160
[Archie shouts]

1:14:02.280 --> 1:14:05.000
[syringe squelching]

1:14:05.120 --> 1:14:07.600
[rain pattering]

1:14:23.040 --> 1:14:24.240
- It didn't work.

1:14:28.000 --> 1:14:28.760
- What?

1:14:30.800 --> 1:14:32.520
- It didn't work, Everett.

1:14:35.120 --> 1:14:37.480
There was only ever
a small chance.

1:14:41.360 --> 1:14:42.320
- A small chance?

1:14:42.440 --> 1:14:46.040
[rain pattering]

1:14:46.160 --> 1:14:47.040
[Archie shouts]

1:14:47.160 --> 1:14:48.480
[body thuds]

1:14:48.600 --> 1:14:51.120
A small chance?
[suspenseful music]

1:14:51.240 --> 1:14:53.840
This was life or
death for me, Archie.

1:14:53.960 --> 1:14:55.320
And you knew that.

1:14:58.800 --> 1:15:01.360
You Randolphs are all the same.

1:15:01.480 --> 1:15:03.600
Always treated me like dirt
on the bottom of your shoe.

1:15:05.160 --> 1:15:08.480
Denied me of my,
my, inheritance!

1:15:08.600 --> 1:15:10.920
[Princess Khenmetptah gasps]

1:15:11.040 --> 1:15:13.200
Now you've utterly ruined me!

1:15:15.880 --> 1:15:17.520
What are you looking at?

1:15:17.640 --> 1:15:20.280
[dramatic music]

1:15:20.400 --> 1:15:25.040
[Everett gasps]
[ominous music]

1:15:25.160 --> 1:15:26.560
What's she doing?

1:15:26.680 --> 1:15:27.640
- I tried to tell you, Everett.

1:15:27.760 --> 1:15:30.560
She's a killer, a murderer!

1:15:30.680 --> 1:15:32.400
They didn't mummify
her because she died.

1:15:32.520 --> 1:15:34.560
She was buried alive!

1:15:36.880 --> 1:15:39.080
[creature growls]

1:15:39.200 --> 1:15:41.920
[dramatic music]

1:15:46.080 --> 1:15:48.840
[creature growls]

1:15:52.360 --> 1:15:53.080
No!

1:15:56.920 --> 1:15:57.960
No!

1:16:20.680 --> 1:16:23.680
[suspenseful music]

1:16:27.720 --> 1:16:31.240
- [Felix Voiceover] There
is one item so dangerous

1:16:31.360 --> 1:16:33.240
it must never see
the light of day.

1:16:35.960 --> 1:16:38.320
The sarcophagus of Khenmetptah.

1:16:38.440 --> 1:16:40.400
[melancholy music]

1:16:40.520 --> 1:16:43.480
[hammer thudding]

1:16:44.200 --> 1:16:47.120
[melancholy music]

1:17:03.160 --> 1:17:07.160
[birds chirping]
[melancholy music]

1:17:07.280 --> 1:17:09.920
- It's a shame to have to
say goodbye to the old place.

1:17:11.240 --> 1:17:13.080
- We've no choice, Archie.

1:17:13.200 --> 1:17:15.800
Not since they printed
that news story.

1:17:15.920 --> 1:17:20.680
- I love you, Nancy, and
I don't care who knows.

1:17:21.560 --> 1:17:23.000
- That's easy for you to say,

1:17:23.120 --> 1:17:24.720
I'd rather not have people
pointing and whispering

1:17:24.840 --> 1:17:27.160
every time I go into
town to get groceries.

1:17:27.280 --> 1:17:29.960
- We would've had to have
moved sooner or later.

1:17:30.080 --> 1:17:33.000
I can't keep a house like
this, not on a doctor's salary.

1:17:34.240 --> 1:17:36.240
- What did you do
with it in the end?

1:17:37.400 --> 1:17:38.720
- With what?

1:17:38.840 --> 1:17:40.320
- You know what.

1:17:40.440 --> 1:17:42.360
That thing.

1:17:44.240 --> 1:17:47.160
- Exactly as Uncle
Felix requested,

1:17:47.280 --> 1:17:48.960
I've moved it back
down to the basement.

1:17:49.080 --> 1:17:52.000
And there's a group of
builders coming this afternoon

1:17:52.120 --> 1:17:53.480
to seal it with brick.

1:17:53.600 --> 1:17:55.560
[melancholy music]

1:17:55.680 --> 1:17:58.040
- I don't think I'll
ever fully get over it.

1:17:58.160 --> 1:17:59.320
What I saw that night.

1:18:01.960 --> 1:18:03.400
- You will, Nancy.

1:18:04.080 --> 1:18:05.840
When we're far away from here.

1:18:06.960 --> 1:18:09.240
I hear the houses in
Coventry are cheap

1:18:09.360 --> 1:18:11.640
and there's an urgent
shortage of doctors.

1:18:13.000 --> 1:18:17.480
Best of all, they've never
even heard of a Randolph.

1:18:18.280 --> 1:18:20.480
[melancholy music]

1:18:24.480 --> 1:18:25.880
- What's that?

1:18:26.000 --> 1:18:27.040
- Front door key
for the builders.

1:18:28.120 --> 1:18:29.080
- Who are they?

1:18:31.120 --> 1:18:33.640
- Some company in town.

1:18:33.760 --> 1:18:34.880
Sykes or something.

1:18:35.000 --> 1:18:38.120
[melancholy music]

1:18:50.680 --> 1:18:53.240
[eerie music]

1:18:55.960 --> 1:18:57.000
- Well, well.

1:18:59.280 --> 1:19:01.720
Looks like poor Everett
was being honest after all.

1:19:03.080 --> 1:19:05.120
Christ, it's even
bigger than I imagined.

1:19:07.320 --> 1:19:09.440
Nobby, pass us a hammer.

1:19:09.560 --> 1:19:12.160
[eerie music]

1:19:14.280 --> 1:19:15.480
Here we go, lads.
