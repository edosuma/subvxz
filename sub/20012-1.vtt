02:48.768 --> 02:49.635
- hey.

02:49.637 --> 02:50.637
- Hi.

02:51.905 --> 02:53.505
- Thanks for coming over,

02:53.507 --> 02:55.340
ugh, I need a tap out.

02:55.342 --> 02:57.876
- Yeah, I don't doubt it.

02:57.878 --> 03:00.679
- He's been on a
bender since Tuesday.

03:00.681 --> 03:00.679
- Have they talked at all?

03:00.681 --> 03:04.383
- No, they haven't
talked, he's just a mess.

03:04.385 --> 03:05.717
- Are his parents here?

03:05.719 --> 03:07.719
- No, they're out of town.

03:07.721 --> 03:09.354
You got the place
all to yourself.

03:09.356 --> 03:10.956
- Oh, yeah, no, I'm not
staying inside all day

03:10.958 --> 03:12.824
with captain Morgan.

03:14.460 --> 03:16.762
- It's good to see your face.

03:16.764 --> 03:20.899
We should hang out more,
like the good old days.

03:22.535 --> 03:24.336
Alright, good to see you.

03:24.338 --> 03:25.737
- Yeah, you too.

03:50.263 --> 03:51.263
Miles?

03:55.301 --> 03:56.301
Miles?

04:05.378 --> 04:08.347
- Becca, what are
you doing here?

04:08.349 --> 04:10.616
- Nice to see you too, miles.

04:10.618 --> 04:10.616
- It's been forever.

04:10.618 --> 04:14.953
- Yeah, well, you really
mastered the art of laying low.

04:14.955 --> 04:17.389
- Well, the last
few months have been

04:17.391 --> 04:19.324
really crazy for me.

04:19.326 --> 04:20.791
- Is this your old room?

04:20.793 --> 04:22.561
It's looks different.

04:22.563 --> 04:25.864
- Yeah, my parents turned
it into a guest room.

04:25.866 --> 04:27.699
- It's very Hilton-esque.

04:27.701 --> 04:28.900
- Thanks.

04:28.902 --> 04:30.402
- I mean that in
like, a nice way.

04:30.404 --> 04:32.437
Like an upscale Hilton.

04:33.473 --> 04:35.774
You know, not like
a Hilton express.

04:35.776 --> 04:38.277
Okay, dude, time to get up.

04:39.345 --> 04:40.345
- Ah!

04:41.681 --> 04:41.680
What are you doing?

04:41.682 --> 04:45.884
- You look pathetic,
so we need to go outside.

04:45.886 --> 04:45.884
- I'm not going anywhere.

04:45.886 --> 04:49.421
- Yeah, you are,
'cause I'm in charge

04:49.423 --> 04:49.421
of making sure you
don't kill yourself

04:49.423 --> 04:54.826
and there's lots of sharp
objects and pills everywhere,

04:55.962 --> 04:57.663
so, let's go.

04:57.665 --> 04:59.031
- Becca, I appreciate the love,

04:59.033 --> 05:01.333
but I'm not in the mood.

05:02.702 --> 05:04.503
- You got 10 minutes.

05:04.505 --> 05:05.537
- I'm not going.

05:05.539 --> 05:06.571
- Yes, you are.

05:06.573 --> 05:06.571
- I'm not.

05:06.573 --> 05:09.608
- Dude, stop feeling
sorry for yourself.

05:09.610 --> 05:11.543
This room fucking stinks
and you look like shit,

05:11.545 --> 05:14.079
so put some pants
on and let's go.

05:14.081 --> 05:16.815
- Becca, I love you, fuck off.

05:21.688 --> 05:21.687
- You know what you need?

05:21.689 --> 05:25.424
- For you to leave me alone?

05:25.426 --> 05:28.727
- You need some happy sad music.

05:28.729 --> 05:28.727
- What?

05:28.729 --> 05:32.831
- Happy sad music,
musically it's uplifting

05:32.833 --> 05:35.767
and lyrically, it makes you
want to rip your heart out.

05:35.769 --> 05:38.770
It makes you feel
better about being sad.

05:38.772 --> 05:41.773
Really miles,
"un-break my heart"?

05:46.012 --> 05:47.679
Ooh, here you go.

05:57.858 --> 05:59.358
- Stop.

06:03.063 --> 06:05.430
- get up, get up,
get up, get up.

06:05.432 --> 06:06.631
- Stop.

06:06.633 --> 06:08.133
- Get up.

06:10.503 --> 06:12.637
Okay, you are wearing pants.

06:55.815 --> 06:57.416
- Cathy's?

06:57.418 --> 06:59.684
- Mimosa actually sounds
pretty good about now.

06:59.686 --> 07:00.552
Is this your car?

07:00.554 --> 07:01.820
- Yep.

07:03.656 --> 07:04.890
- You getting in?

07:04.892 --> 07:06.458
- Nope.

07:06.460 --> 07:07.793
- Nobody walks anywhere.

07:07.795 --> 07:09.828
- Exactly.

07:09.830 --> 07:10.929
- I don't wanna walk.

07:10.931 --> 07:12.898
- Dude, it's five blocks.

07:12.900 --> 07:14.800
- I'm still
hungover from last night.

07:14.802 --> 07:16.835
- Whiner.

07:16.837 --> 07:20.572
- Are you fuckin'
serious with this parking job?

07:20.574 --> 07:23.008
Probably should walk,

07:23.010 --> 07:24.010
wait up!

07:26.479 --> 07:28.447
- Do you remember the
day we met, miles?

07:28.449 --> 07:30.115
- Can I buy a vowel, I
think I'm still hungover

07:30.117 --> 07:31.917
from last night.

07:31.919 --> 07:33.218
- It was the
first day of school.

07:33.220 --> 07:33.218
- Right.

07:33.220 --> 07:35.720
- You remember what
we did, Bueller?

07:35.722 --> 07:37.489
- Oh my god, stop doing that.

07:37.491 --> 07:39.991
We ditched school, we walked
around, we went bowling.

07:39.993 --> 07:41.760
- Exactly, well, we're gonna
do the same thing today.

07:41.762 --> 07:41.760
- Not in the mood to go bowling.

07:41.762 --> 07:41.760
- Well, I'm not
talking about going,

07:41.762 --> 07:46.565
well, actually, I
could go bowling later,

07:46.567 --> 07:47.833
I don't have any socks with me,

07:47.835 --> 07:47.833
it's not the point.

07:47.835 --> 07:47.833
- What's the point?

07:47.835 --> 07:52.471
- The point is,
we're gonna take the day,

07:52.473 --> 07:54.873
walk around and
talk our shit out.

07:54.875 --> 07:58.143
- Our shit, what's your
shit, I know my shit.

07:58.145 --> 07:59.244
- You first.

08:01.781 --> 08:01.780
- The woman I was
planning on spending

08:01.782 --> 08:01.780
the rest of my life
with just told me

08:01.782 --> 08:01.780
she cheated on me and we're
supposed to get married

08:01.782 --> 08:07.085
in two weeks and
now I don't know

08:07.087 --> 08:08.520
what the fuck I'm going to do.

08:08.522 --> 08:09.888
Can you top that?

08:09.890 --> 08:11.857
- Not this year.

08:11.859 --> 08:12.891
- Didn't think so

08:12.893 --> 08:12.891
- Yeah.

08:12.893 --> 08:14.626
- What's your shit?

08:14.628 --> 08:15.628
- My shit.

08:17.763 --> 08:20.699
I think I might
move to New York.

08:20.701 --> 08:20.699
- That's crazy, why?

08:20.701 --> 08:23.702
- I know, well, do you
remember my friend Erin?

08:23.704 --> 08:23.702
- Yeah.

08:23.704 --> 08:23.702
- Her and I have been
planning this community

08:23.704 --> 08:28.206
art gallery since college,

08:28.208 --> 08:29.975
we'll sell our own
art, we'll sell other

08:29.977 --> 08:31.643
people's art, we'll give classes

08:31.645 --> 08:34.913
and we'll do like a
community art project thing.

08:34.914 --> 08:34.913
I don't know, we've
been working on it

08:34.914 --> 08:34.913
for a long time and
we've both been saving,

08:34.914 --> 08:38.917
so, now is the time.

08:39.684 --> 08:41.753
I think I'm gonna do it.

08:41.755 --> 08:44.823
- You do realize how insane
of an idea that is, right?

08:44.825 --> 08:46.591
- Thanks, miles.

08:46.593 --> 08:48.059
- I mean, the only, the
one percent are even

08:48.061 --> 08:51.162
spending any money on art,
it's not community art.

08:51.164 --> 08:51.162
Where would you even live?

08:51.164 --> 08:51.162
- You sound like my father.

08:51.164 --> 08:55.667
- Well, I'm glad somebody
else is on the same page.

08:55.669 --> 08:56.835
- Oh and I have to let
her know by tomorrow

08:56.837 --> 08:56.835
if I'm in or not.

08:56.837 --> 08:56.835
- This is not the
kind of decision you

08:56.837 --> 09:00.038
wanna rush into.

09:00.806 --> 09:00.805
- I'm not rushing into it,

09:00.807 --> 09:03.542
we've been working on
it for over a year.

09:03.544 --> 09:05.043
We just found the perfect place

09:05.045 --> 09:06.778
and we have to let
them know by tomorrow

09:06.780 --> 09:08.813
if we want to do the
down payment, so.

09:08.815 --> 09:10.682
- Yeah, 'cause there's
like a real lack of rundown

09:10.684 --> 09:12.584
commercial space in New York.

09:12.586 --> 09:14.553
- Wow, why do you care
if I move to New York?

09:14.555 --> 09:15.854
- I don't care.

09:17.557 --> 09:17.556
I mean, I do, I do.

09:17.558 --> 09:20.191
It would be weird
not having you here.

09:20.193 --> 09:22.093
- Sweet.

09:22.095 --> 09:24.663
- So, now I have to figure
out my life's course

09:24.665 --> 09:24.663
with my cheating fiance
because some slum lord

09:24.665 --> 09:29.868
in Brooklyn said I need
my money by tomorrow?

09:30.770 --> 09:32.203
- What is that?

09:32.205 --> 09:32.203
- What?

09:32.205 --> 09:32.203
- What is that accent?

09:32.205 --> 09:37.242
- It was just slumlord.

09:37.244 --> 09:38.810
- Yeah, pretty much.

09:38.812 --> 09:38.810
- Yeah, whatever,
my head's spinning,

09:38.812 --> 09:41.846
I'm gonna go to
sleep, wake me up when

09:41.848 --> 09:43.315
you know your life's course.

09:43.317 --> 09:45.317
- What is this,
what's happening?

09:45.319 --> 09:47.218
This isn't the miles I know.

09:47.220 --> 09:50.655
- The miles you know
had a really rough week.

10:06.806 --> 10:08.707
- Do you remember why that
day was so awesome, miles?

10:08.709 --> 10:09.708
- No.

10:09.710 --> 10:09.708
- Because it was a day when
everything in our lives

10:09.710 --> 10:09.708
was about to change and
instead of freaking out

10:09.710 --> 10:17.710
about new teachers and
classes and new friends,

10:18.918 --> 10:21.886
we just, we hit pause
and walked around

10:21.888 --> 10:26.224
and we talked shit out
and we took it all in.

10:26.226 --> 10:27.125
- Went bowling.

10:27.127 --> 10:27.125
- We went bowling.

10:27.127 --> 10:28.827
- Played skee ball.

10:28.829 --> 10:30.028
- Yes.

10:30.030 --> 10:30.895
- God, I miss playing skee ball.

10:30.897 --> 10:30.895
- Right?

10:30.897 --> 10:33.365
- The app's not, it
doesn't feel the same.

10:33.367 --> 10:33.365
- It's not the same.

10:33.367 --> 10:37.869
Life was still there
for us 24 hours later.

10:37.871 --> 10:38.871
- It was.

10:40.239 --> 10:44.275
- It's a different day, but
it's the same situation.

10:44.277 --> 10:44.275
- I don't know, lady,
I'm not feeling it.

10:44.277 --> 10:48.313
- Come on, do it today,
today, me and you, today,

10:48.315 --> 10:50.115
come on, are you in?

10:50.117 --> 10:51.182
Are you in?

10:52.351 --> 10:53.351
Are you in?

10:54.221 --> 10:55.420
- One second.

10:57.923 --> 10:58.923
Hi.

10:58.925 --> 11:01.693
- Miles, honey, I've
called Sam's parents

11:01.695 --> 11:03.762
and we've set up a pow-wow
for tomorrow evening

11:03.764 --> 11:06.264
so we can all just sit down
and sort this out together.

11:06.266 --> 11:08.033
- A pow-wow?

11:08.035 --> 11:09.134
You're not supposed
to be back from

11:09.136 --> 11:09.134
vacation until next week.

11:09.136 --> 11:09.134
- Yeah, well, that was
before we found out

11:09.136 --> 11:15.073
that the wedding we've
already invested $20,000 in

11:15.075 --> 11:16.841
might be cancelled.

11:16.843 --> 11:21.146
- Yeah, um, I'm sorry,
I just, I don't know

11:21.148 --> 11:22.747
how I feel right now.

11:22.749 --> 11:25.850
- Miles, this is not
about you anymore,

11:25.852 --> 11:28.887
so if you're splitting, we
need to remove the emotion.

11:28.889 --> 11:28.887
- Mom!

11:28.889 --> 11:28.887
- Okay, money's involved.

11:28.889 --> 11:28.887
- Seriously?

11:28.889 --> 11:34.359
- Your father and I are
coming back for this, alright?

11:34.361 --> 11:36.895
We're a team, we'll
work it out together.

11:36.897 --> 11:38.263
- Alright, mom, mom, I just-

11:38.265 --> 11:39.464
- okay, no more
arguments, alright?

11:39.466 --> 11:41.466
No more arguments, we love you,

11:41.468 --> 11:44.769
we're here for you,
we'll see you tomorrow.

11:44.771 --> 11:45.771
- Okay.

11:52.478 --> 11:53.344
- Everything okay?

11:53.346 --> 11:54.346
- Amazing.

11:57.450 --> 11:58.450
- So are you in?

11:58.452 --> 12:00.151
- No.

12:00.153 --> 12:00.151
- Are you in?

12:00.153 --> 12:03.254
Are you in, are you in,
are you in, are you in?

12:03.256 --> 12:05.256
- Stop tickling me.

12:05.258 --> 12:06.725
Yeah, I'm in.

12:06.727 --> 12:09.861
- Really.

12:11.297 --> 12:13.031
Okay, here are the rules.

12:13.033 --> 12:14.132
- Really, there's rules?

12:14.134 --> 12:14.999
You always do that.

12:15.001 --> 12:14.999
- What?

12:15.001 --> 12:14.999
- You get me
to decide on something

12:15.001 --> 12:14.999
and then you tell me the rules.

12:15.001 --> 12:20.271
You need to tell me the
rules before I decide on it.

12:20.273 --> 12:22.941
- Well, you
already agreed, so sorry.

12:22.943 --> 12:24.743
- This is so fucking stupid,

12:24.745 --> 12:24.743
what are the rules?

12:24.745 --> 12:27.245
- Okay, the rules are,
we do everything the way

12:27.247 --> 12:28.947
that we did them in high school.

12:28.949 --> 12:30.482
- I'm not wearing cargo shorts.

12:30.484 --> 12:31.816
- Thank god.

12:31.818 --> 12:31.816
No, I mean, we didn't
drive in high school,

12:31.818 --> 12:35.987
we didn't have cars, so
there's no driving today.

12:35.989 --> 12:35.987
- Can we get rides?

12:35.989 --> 12:35.987
- Did we get rides
in high school?

12:35.989 --> 12:40.125
- That's a loaded question,
you got rides in high school.

12:40.127 --> 12:42.994
- Shut up.

12:42.996 --> 12:44.429
Then yes, we can get rides.

12:44.431 --> 12:46.231
- Is that it?

12:46.233 --> 12:48.099
- Uh, no cellphones.

12:49.902 --> 12:49.901
- Fuck no.

12:49.903 --> 12:52.537
- Dude, we're not checking
them all day, come on.

12:52.539 --> 12:52.537
- You first.

12:52.539 --> 12:55.273
- Same time.

12:56.776 --> 12:57.909
- What about my iPod?

12:57.911 --> 12:58.943
- Your iPod?

12:58.945 --> 13:00.044
- Yeah.

13:00.046 --> 13:01.179
- You have an iPod?

13:01.181 --> 13:01.179
- Yes.

13:01.181 --> 13:01.179
- That's what this is for.

13:01.181 --> 13:01.179
- I don't keep my music on mine.

13:01.181 --> 13:01.179
- Oh my god, alright,
as much as I'd love

13:01.181 --> 13:08.052
to see you rock a boombox
on your shoulder all day,

13:08.054 --> 13:11.456
your second iPhone will be fine.

13:11.458 --> 13:13.124
- You're a match.

13:17.062 --> 13:18.363
- You wanna talk about it?

13:18.365 --> 13:19.365
- No.

13:21.367 --> 13:25.370
- Cool, so what else is
going on in your life?

13:28.073 --> 13:32.076
- Um, she gets home from
work on Tuesday night

13:32.078 --> 13:34.212
and I had already
had like a suspicion

13:34.214 --> 13:37.282
that she had been
reading my diary.

13:38.918 --> 13:40.351
What?

13:40.353 --> 13:41.419
- You have a diary?

13:41.421 --> 13:42.421
- Yeah.

13:44.557 --> 13:46.124
Are you trying to
make me feel better?

13:46.126 --> 13:46.124
- Sorry.

13:46.126 --> 13:46.124
- Anyway, I always put
the bookmark in the back

13:46.126 --> 13:50.128
by the spine and a
couple times I saw it

13:50.130 --> 13:51.596
in the middle.

13:51.598 --> 13:54.532
- Wow, Nancy drew
is on the case.

13:55.501 --> 13:57.068
What, were you
fighting or something?

13:57.070 --> 13:57.068
- I mean, most days we're cool,

13:57.070 --> 13:59.938
but some days, it just
seemed like she was

13:59.940 --> 13:59.938
just kind of like
looking right through me.

13:59.940 --> 14:03.541
I just didn't think
anything had gone that far.

14:03.543 --> 14:05.243
- Right, so it's weird
'cause she's being distant.

14:05.245 --> 14:06.377
- Yeah, yeah, but
I just didn't think

14:06.379 --> 14:08.112
it had gotten extreme.

14:08.114 --> 14:10.048
- So what happened?

14:10.050 --> 14:13.251
- She denied that
she read my journal

14:14.854 --> 14:16.454
and I told her she was lying.

14:16.456 --> 14:17.322
- Ah, that's bold.

14:17.324 --> 14:18.489
- Yeah.

14:18.491 --> 14:18.489
- How did you know
she was lying?

14:18.491 --> 14:18.489
- 'Cause I knew she was
lying and then she just

14:18.491 --> 14:23.561
laces into me about how
like, I can't trust her

14:23.563 --> 14:25.129
and how fucked up
that is that I can't

14:25.131 --> 14:25.129
trust the person I'm
gonna be spending

14:25.131 --> 14:25.129
the rest of my life with
and that all my insecurities

14:25.131 --> 14:29.934
drive her crazy and then
she decides to tell me

14:29.936 --> 14:32.871
that she's, that
she cheated on me.

14:32.873 --> 14:35.340
- Holy shit.

14:35.342 --> 14:36.908
- Yeah, fucking sucked.

14:36.910 --> 14:38.142
I was blown away and I'm like,

14:38.144 --> 14:38.142
there's no way
you cheated on me,

14:38.144 --> 14:40.278
you're lying about that.

14:40.280 --> 14:40.278
- Well, how did
you know that she,

14:40.280 --> 14:44.949
wait, how did you know
she read your diary?

14:45.551 --> 14:48.019
- 'Cause I read her diary.

14:50.022 --> 14:51.022
- Miles.

14:53.158 --> 14:53.157
- Alright, let me know if you

14:53.159 --> 14:53.157
need something, sweetie.

14:53.159 --> 14:57.228
- So, did she write anything
about his guy in the diary?

14:57.230 --> 14:58.897
- No.

14:58.899 --> 15:00.098
- Can I get
you something to drink?

15:00.100 --> 15:01.299
- Coffee, please.

15:01.301 --> 15:01.299
- Okay.

15:01.301 --> 15:05.103
- Yeah, and can I have
a coffee and a water.

15:05.105 --> 15:05.970
- Yep.

15:05.972 --> 15:07.639
- And a diet coke?

15:07.641 --> 15:08.940
- Okay.

15:08.942 --> 15:11.342
- And a chocolate milkshake.

15:12.311 --> 15:13.444
- Okay.

15:13.446 --> 15:15.280
- And a mimosa.

15:15.282 --> 15:18.683
Just bring 'em all
out as they're ready.

15:22.354 --> 15:25.590
- So, what'd you do when she
told you she cheated on you?

15:25.592 --> 15:28.593
- Freaked out, I mean, it's
like all my worst fears

15:28.595 --> 15:29.928
coming true.

15:29.930 --> 15:29.928
My whole life I just
wanted a relationship

15:29.930 --> 15:34.465
like my parents, you know,
like they fight, they bicker,

15:34.467 --> 15:37.302
like everybody else,
but underneath it all,

15:37.304 --> 15:39.437
there's like this
love and respect

15:39.439 --> 15:42.273
and like a genuine friendship,

15:42.275 --> 15:45.209
I don't know if
we ever had that.

15:46.312 --> 15:48.379
So, I left the apartment

15:48.381 --> 15:51.115
and I've been home ever since.

15:52.151 --> 15:53.551
- And you haven't talked to her?

15:53.553 --> 15:56.187
- She called, but she
didn't leave a message.

15:56.189 --> 15:57.655
- You didn't call her back?

15:57.657 --> 15:58.523
- I don't know if I'm
ready to talk to her.

15:58.525 --> 15:59.991
- Miles.

16:03.963 --> 16:03.962
- No.

16:03.964 --> 16:03.962
- Can I please
have my phone back?

16:03.964 --> 16:03.962
- No, it's against the
rules, I'm not gonna look.

16:03.964 --> 16:08.967
Trust me, it's for the best.

16:08.969 --> 16:08.967
- Whatever.

16:08.969 --> 16:11.636
- It is, you didn't
seem too thrilled

16:11.638 --> 16:13.104
about whoever it was
you were talking to

16:13.106 --> 16:14.672
on the way over
here, who was that?

16:14.674 --> 16:15.674
- My mom.

16:16.475 --> 16:18.276
- Oh, how's she doing?

16:18.278 --> 16:20.745
- She and my dad are coming
home from vacation early,

16:20.747 --> 16:22.680
tomorrow, and they've
already had a talk with

16:22.682 --> 16:25.984
Sam's parents and we're having
a pow-wow to talk it out.

16:25.986 --> 16:29.120
- Wow, that's a thing
that's gonna happen?

16:29.122 --> 16:29.120
- I tried to talk her out of it,

16:29.122 --> 16:32.490
but she had a lot of
money had been invested

16:32.492 --> 16:37.495
in the wedding and it was about
more than just me and Sam.

16:37.497 --> 16:39.530
- Damn, those Jews
know how to guilt.

16:39.532 --> 16:42.533
- Yeah, oh, perfect timing.

16:42.535 --> 16:46.037
Champagne, morning
beverage of life, cheers.

16:46.039 --> 16:47.138
- L'Chaim.

16:47.140 --> 16:49.007
- Thanks, my coffee?

16:50.676 --> 16:50.675
- Just tell me who called.

16:50.677 --> 16:55.146
- No, trust me, it's
better this way.

16:55.148 --> 16:56.714
- I'm gonna go
pee outta my dick.

16:56.716 --> 16:58.583
- Is there any other way?

16:58.585 --> 16:59.751
- Outta my butt?

16:59.753 --> 17:02.553
- That's gross and unnecessary.

17:05.656 --> 17:05.656
- Interscope, we're throwing

17:05.657 --> 17:05.656
a party for Kanye tonight,

17:05.657 --> 17:11.462
so I could put you on the
VIP guest list if you want.

17:11.464 --> 17:13.297
- Yeah, you
wanna come pick me up?

17:13.299 --> 17:13.297
- I could
do that, where do you live?

17:13.299 --> 17:13.297
- Well, I have a
herpes support group

17:13.299 --> 17:18.269
on San Vincente, but
I'll be finished around

17:18.271 --> 17:20.471
eight o'clock, so you
can pick me up there.

17:20.473 --> 17:20.471
- That's really funny.

17:20.473 --> 17:20.471
- No, no, you don't
have to be worried,

17:20.473 --> 17:24.474
I haven't had a breakout
in like, a week.

17:24.477 --> 17:24.474
Valtrex really works, you know?

17:24.477 --> 17:27.278
- Great, yeah, I see

17:27.280 --> 17:28.179
what's going on here.

17:28.181 --> 17:28.179
- Yeah.

17:28.181 --> 17:28.179
- Take care.

17:28.181 --> 17:34.519
- Don't be silly,
protect your Willy.

17:37.189 --> 17:39.057
Thanks for brunch, miles.

17:39.059 --> 17:41.559
- Thanks for
getting me out of the house.

17:41.561 --> 17:43.461
- So, I have
to stop by the gallery

17:43.463 --> 17:46.064
to pick up my check, can
you find something there

17:46.066 --> 17:46.064
to keep busy for a minute?

17:46.066 --> 17:50.501
- Ugh, art, sounds depressing.

17:51.638 --> 17:55.440
- Miles, it's Sam, your fiance,

17:56.608 --> 17:59.177
um, look I really fucked up,

18:01.080 --> 18:02.613
please call me, I
don't know why you're

18:02.615 --> 18:04.682
not answering my phone calls,

18:04.684 --> 18:08.219
but it's really
important that we talk.

18:26.105 --> 18:27.171
- Yo.

18:27.173 --> 18:27.171
- Hey.

18:27.173 --> 18:29.707
- Good call on the happy
sad music, it works.

18:29.709 --> 18:29.707
- What are you listening to?

18:29.709 --> 18:33.244
- NWA, "I ain't the one".

18:33.246 --> 18:34.479
Did you do what you had to do?

18:34.481 --> 18:36.247
- Yeah, my boss is such a bitch.

18:36.249 --> 18:37.515
- Why?

18:37.517 --> 18:40.118
- She's cutting
like, half my shifts.

18:40.120 --> 18:41.686
- New York's looking
good about now.

18:41.688 --> 18:43.688
- Better every second.

18:45.624 --> 18:47.291
What do you think it's called?

18:47.293 --> 18:49.527
- Fuck you, bitch.

18:49.529 --> 18:49.527
- Emphasis on the you.

18:49.529 --> 18:53.564
- Definitely,
definitely, I mean it's

18:53.566 --> 18:56.901
obvious the artist came
home from a vacation

18:56.903 --> 18:59.303
in a fancy European castle
he took his girl to,

18:59.305 --> 19:01.272
she was like a bitch
the entire time,

19:01.274 --> 19:03.908
they ended up breaking up and
then he came home to America.

19:03.910 --> 19:05.910
He painted the castle.

19:08.547 --> 19:12.683
- It's called "so this
is love" and it is

19:12.685 --> 19:15.520
sleeping beauty's
castle at Disneyland,

19:15.522 --> 19:18.890
which is literally the
happiest place on earth.

19:18.892 --> 19:21.792
- Hmm, so you're
looking at the painting.

19:21.794 --> 19:25.296
See, I'm kind of looking
beyond the painting,

19:25.298 --> 19:26.430
at the subtext.

19:26.432 --> 19:28.332
- Subtext, right, yeah.

19:28.334 --> 19:30.568
What about this one?

19:30.570 --> 19:32.403
- Hmm, it's vagina.

19:34.473 --> 19:34.472
It's a closed vagina.

19:34.474 --> 19:36.841
It's a vagina he's
never gonna have again

19:36.843 --> 19:39.443
and this girl cheated on him,

19:39.445 --> 19:41.779
he's left, he's over it

19:41.781 --> 19:46.250
and now it's just a dusty,
locked away closed vag.

19:48.720 --> 19:51.856
- Uh, this one is
called "Donazione"

19:52.791 --> 19:54.392
and it is Michelangelo
the day before

19:54.394 --> 19:55.960
he starts painting
the Sistine chapel.

19:55.962 --> 19:58.629
It represents, you know,
possibilities are endless,

19:58.631 --> 20:00.831
with a open heart,
the masterpiece that

20:00.833 --> 20:03.201
you can create with love.

20:03.203 --> 20:05.269
- I don't see Michelangelo.

20:05.271 --> 20:08.873
- He's right there in the
middle, holding a paint can.

20:08.875 --> 20:11.475
- Eh, once again, the subtext.

20:11.477 --> 20:12.343
Oh, what about this one?

20:12.345 --> 20:12.343
- We should go.

20:12.345 --> 20:13.878
- He's being sarcastic.

20:13.880 --> 20:13.878
- Yeah.

20:13.880 --> 20:13.878
- No, there should be
like a exclamation point

20:13.880 --> 20:20.451
or like a happy face
or something, you know?

20:30.262 --> 20:32.597
- This is where
I hide on my lunch break.

20:32.599 --> 20:34.332
- It's all so subjective,

20:34.334 --> 20:35.499
like who decides what's good art

20:35.501 --> 20:37.501
and what's bad art?

20:37.503 --> 20:39.003
- We do.

20:39.005 --> 20:40.605
- Maybe you do, working in that

20:40.607 --> 20:42.540
fancy schmancy gallery, not me.

20:42.542 --> 20:47.011
- No, I mean, you decide
whether you like it or not.

20:47.013 --> 20:48.813
Just because it's in
a museum or a gallery,

20:48.815 --> 20:51.782
it doesn't mean that
it's good or bad.

20:51.784 --> 20:54.518
You have to decide if
you like it for yourself.

20:54.520 --> 20:56.420
- Yeah, but it's
not about talent.

20:56.422 --> 20:57.655
It's like more important to be

20:57.657 --> 20:59.590
a good salesman
than a good artist.

20:59.592 --> 21:02.660
- Isn't that true
about everything in life?

21:02.662 --> 21:06.731
- I hope not, I
suck at selling myself.

21:08.767 --> 21:10.935
- No, I
don't care, I don't care.

21:10.937 --> 21:13.471
Tell that bitch mother of yours

21:13.473 --> 21:15.840
to get here, I
don't care, traffic,

21:15.842 --> 21:18.309
we know there's traffic
in Los Angeles, sweetie.

21:18.311 --> 21:20.811
We know that, but I
need you here now.

21:20.813 --> 21:23.814
Now, I've got a meeting with
Zack Efron in 10 minutes, baby.

21:23.816 --> 21:26.284
No, no you can't meet him!

21:27.286 --> 21:28.486
- That's the exactly
the reason I never

21:28.488 --> 21:29.754
want to be good
at selling myself.

21:29.756 --> 21:31.455
Guy's a complete douche.

21:31.457 --> 21:32.523
- Yeah, I know, that's
why I don't wanna

21:32.525 --> 21:32.523
live in la anymore.

21:32.525 --> 21:34.558
- Yeah, but that
guy's not from la.

21:34.560 --> 21:36.360
He's a transplant.

21:36.362 --> 21:38.829
People from la
are actually cool.

21:38.831 --> 21:38.829
It's all these douches
that move out here

21:38.831 --> 21:42.733
after watching too much
swimming with sharks

21:42.735 --> 21:44.568
and entourage, they think
you have to be a complete

21:44.570 --> 21:46.337
asshole to make it in
la, but really they're

21:46.339 --> 21:46.337
just ruining it for
the people who actually

21:46.339 --> 21:51.742
have like a, vision and
a decent moral compass.

21:52.544 --> 21:53.744
- Isn't Sam from la?

21:53.746 --> 21:54.746
- So?

21:56.648 --> 21:58.816
- She's really cool,
miles, have you thought

21:58.818 --> 22:01.752
about maybe trying
to work it out?

22:03.689 --> 22:03.688
It's just a thought.

22:03.690 --> 22:03.688
- Yeah, of course
I've thought about it.

22:03.690 --> 22:08.826
I've thought about everything,
I can't stop thinking,

22:08.828 --> 22:09.860
the problem is, I
don't know what I want

22:09.862 --> 22:11.095
and I haven't spoken to her,

22:11.097 --> 22:11.095
so I don't know what she wants

22:11.097 --> 22:15.533
and honesty, I don't even
know if I care what she wants.

22:15.535 --> 22:16.734
I kinda wanna know what I want

22:16.736 --> 22:19.003
before I talk to her.

22:19.005 --> 22:20.638
- It makes sense.

22:25.078 --> 22:25.943
- You can't answer it.

22:25.945 --> 22:27.545
- Don't want to.

22:28.747 --> 22:31.749
- Hello, hey, there you are,

22:31.751 --> 22:35.753
this is dad, uh, boy
am I sorry that I

22:35.755 --> 22:38.856
screamed at you so much
on the phone earlier.

22:38.858 --> 22:40.624
I didn't mean to be that loud,

22:40.626 --> 22:41.992
I just was a little
bit more than surprised

22:41.994 --> 22:43.728
that you were suddenly
gonna move to New York

22:43.730 --> 22:45.896
and leave your job here,

22:45.898 --> 22:47.598
so anyway, just
give me a call back

22:47.600 --> 22:48.966
and we can discuss, sorry,

22:48.968 --> 22:52.370
it just doesn't make
a lot of sense to me.

22:52.372 --> 22:53.372
So, bye.

22:58.044 --> 23:02.847
- Shouldn't we be
a little more low profile?

23:02.849 --> 23:04.682
- Always a
sketcher in every group.

23:04.684 --> 23:04.682
- What?

23:04.684 --> 23:08.152
- You know, it's like the
first rule of smoking weed

23:08.154 --> 23:09.954
is every group has
somebody who completely

23:09.956 --> 23:12.656
bugs out, I knew it
wasn't gonna be me.

23:12.658 --> 23:14.658
- I'm just saying, we're not
even pretending to hide it.

23:14.660 --> 23:16.694
- But that's what
they expect you to do.

23:16.696 --> 23:19.730
You know, if you're just like,
walking around in public,

23:19.732 --> 23:21.532
in the middle of the
day smoking weed,

23:21.534 --> 23:21.532
no one's gonna see it, because
they're not expecting it,

23:21.534 --> 23:24.902
but if you're like, you know,
hiding behind a dumpster,

23:24.904 --> 23:28.773
like tucked down in some
shrub, it looks shady,

23:28.775 --> 23:30.441
plus it's practically legal.

23:30.443 --> 23:32.676
- I can't believe
you're a teacher.

23:32.678 --> 23:33.878
- Believe it.

23:36.948 --> 23:39.083
- We need a new mission.

23:42.087 --> 23:44.688
- How about we go
around Los Angeles

23:44.690 --> 23:46.123
and we try and find the
most beautiful thing

23:46.125 --> 23:47.958
we've never seen.

23:47.960 --> 23:49.760
- Way too upbeat
for me right now.

23:49.762 --> 23:51.829
- Okay, I'll look
for the most beautiful

23:51.831 --> 23:55.566
thing and you look
for the ugliest.

23:55.568 --> 23:57.968
- Now we're cookin' with gas

23:58.703 --> 24:01.439
this is for both of us, thanks.

24:13.853 --> 24:14.853
- Oh, man.

24:17.122 --> 24:17.121
- Just 'cause he can't hear us

24:17.123 --> 24:21.058
doesn't mean we can't
smell your fart.

24:21.060 --> 24:23.160
I actually can't
smell it anymore.

24:24.831 --> 24:26.030
Just kidding.

24:26.865 --> 24:28.466
What's his name?

24:29.634 --> 24:31.602
- Uh, his name is Eric
Abrams, but his friends

24:31.604 --> 24:33.103
call him Gabrams.

24:34.072 --> 24:34.071
- Occupation?

24:34.073 --> 24:38.742
- Oh, he does valet
down at the Biltmore,

24:38.744 --> 24:41.212
but he's an aspiring BARISTA.

24:41.214 --> 24:42.947
- Place of origin?

24:43.882 --> 24:45.683
- Duh, Florida.

24:45.685 --> 24:47.151
- Let's check it out.

24:47.153 --> 24:48.586
- No!

24:49.921 --> 24:52.056
- Where you from?

24:52.058 --> 24:53.023
- Huh?

24:53.025 --> 24:53.891
- Where you from?

24:53.893 --> 24:54.758
- Houston.

24:54.760 --> 24:56.227
- Oh, that's cool.

24:56.229 --> 24:57.229
- Is it?

24:57.963 --> 24:59.630
- Uh, I guess not.

25:01.766 --> 25:03.901
- Do we have any
other questions?

25:03.903 --> 25:06.237
- What are you listening to?

25:06.239 --> 25:08.606
- Dude, you really care?

25:08.608 --> 25:10.007
- Are they good?

25:11.176 --> 25:12.176
- Yeah.

25:14.679 --> 25:15.913
- Nice fart by the way.

25:15.915 --> 25:17.548
- Thank you.

25:20.186 --> 25:23.687
- Oh god, it's so
gorgeous out today.

25:23.689 --> 25:26.023
- Are you really ready to move?

25:26.025 --> 25:27.825
New York's freezing.

25:27.827 --> 25:29.527
Everybody just complains
about the weather there,

25:29.529 --> 25:29.527
it's like how we
complain about traffic.

25:29.529 --> 25:33.297
- I know, I know, but
I've been talking about it

25:33.299 --> 25:36.100
forever and I feel like
if I don't actually do it

25:36.102 --> 25:38.002
I'm just gonna
always be a talker.

25:38.004 --> 25:39.303
- You gotta be smart about it,

25:39.305 --> 25:40.871
you can't be like,
I have to decide

25:40.873 --> 25:40.871
in one day kind of decision.

25:40.873 --> 25:44.208
- I am miles, I've been
talking about it forever.

25:44.210 --> 25:47.545
- So then what's
the debate about?

25:47.547 --> 25:51.815
- Honestly, my dad and you
guys, you know, my friends.

25:52.884 --> 25:55.085
- What'd your dad say?

25:55.087 --> 25:55.085
- Ah, same shit you did,

25:55.087 --> 25:58.689
what about your savings,
where are you gonna live,

25:58.691 --> 26:02.760
blah blah blah, it's just,

26:02.762 --> 26:05.596
you know, he's never say it
but he'd be lonely without me,

26:05.598 --> 26:07.164
you know, I take care of him.

26:07.166 --> 26:08.799
- Does he ever get out?

26:08.801 --> 26:10.868
- Yeah, he's gone
on a few dates,

26:10.870 --> 26:14.104
I don't know, I think it's
hard for him, you know

26:14.106 --> 26:18.676
because it feels like
he's cheating on my mom.

26:18.678 --> 26:19.877
- That sucks.

26:21.179 --> 26:22.913
- Yeah, it's hard.

26:25.317 --> 26:30.020
Sometimes he calls me
by her name by accident.

26:30.022 --> 26:32.222
- How are you holding up?

26:33.725 --> 26:37.161
- Depends, sometimes
I wake up and I forget

26:37.163 --> 26:39.129
that she's gone.

26:43.134 --> 26:45.269
Can we talk about
something else?

26:45.271 --> 26:47.004
- Oh, yeah, sorry.

26:48.006 --> 26:51.609
It's still really not
proper stoner talk.

26:52.644 --> 26:56.013
Ugliest thing in la,
let's go, found it.

26:57.916 --> 27:00.017
Ugliest thing I've
never seen in la,

27:00.019 --> 27:01.151
Nickelback at the Wiltern.

27:02.822 --> 27:04.021
- I wonder how
Beck feels about that,

27:04.023 --> 27:05.856
he's playing on Friday.

27:05.858 --> 27:07.825
- Probably the same way
gene Kelly, frank Sinatra,

27:07.827 --> 27:09.860
Judy garland feel,
they're all rolling over

27:09.862 --> 27:11.662
in their graves.

27:11.664 --> 27:13.797
They used to run this
street back in the day.

27:13.799 --> 27:15.366
All the Hollywood big wigs,
they lived around here.

27:15.368 --> 27:17.901
My dad grew up around here.

27:18.903 --> 27:20.337
Quality time with
my dad would be him

27:20.339 --> 27:22.172
taking me around all
the neighborhoods,

27:22.174 --> 27:24.775
explaining the history,
the architecture.

27:24.777 --> 27:28.312
That and watching Rogers
and Hammerstein musicals.

27:28.314 --> 27:29.747
- You must have
tried with all your might

27:29.749 --> 27:29.747
not to go gay.

27:29.749 --> 27:33.917
- Wasn't easy,
still doubt it sometimes.

27:33.919 --> 27:33.917
You know, when I'm in the car,

27:33.919 --> 27:36.720
singing alone to
Whitney Houston.

27:36.722 --> 27:36.720
- Early Whitney?

27:36.722 --> 27:40.391
- "How will I know", "I
wanna dance with somebody".

27:40.393 --> 27:40.391
- Oh yeah, you can't
not sing along to

27:40.393 --> 27:44.828
the late, great
Whitney Houston, rip.

27:46.798 --> 27:50.034
What was down here,
wasn't it the ams-thing.

27:50.036 --> 27:50.034
- Ambassador.

27:50.036 --> 27:52.336
- And the coconut girl, right?

27:52.338 --> 27:52.336
- Yeah.

27:52.338 --> 27:52.336
- They tore those down?

27:52.338 --> 27:57.241
- Yeah, they built a 600
million dollar high school.

27:57.243 --> 27:57.241
- 600 million?

27:57.243 --> 28:00.177
- Yeah, yeah, let's
just tear down a really

28:00.179 --> 28:02.279
important piece of la history,

28:02.281 --> 28:04.682
lay off thousands of
teachers during a depression

28:04.684 --> 28:08.318
and built a 600 million
dollar high school.

28:08.320 --> 28:09.386
We love it!

28:13.291 --> 28:15.759
Where bing Crosby first sang,

28:15.761 --> 28:17.361
where Marilyn Monroe
first signed a contract

28:17.363 --> 28:21.165
to become a model, where Robert
Kennedy was assassinated.

28:21.167 --> 28:24.268
Now the most expensive school
in the history of America.

28:24.270 --> 28:26.203
- That building
better be able to fly.

28:26.205 --> 28:26.203
- It's like, how many
teachers could you pay

28:26.205 --> 28:30.741
for 600 million dollars,
our system is so fucked.

28:30.743 --> 28:34.211
- Bet the sloppy Joe's
are off the chain.

28:38.383 --> 28:41.985
- Whatever, I'm
just a cog in the wheel.

28:41.987 --> 28:43.821
I stopped practicing
law because I actually

28:43.823 --> 28:46.390
wanted to try and
help people but,

28:46.392 --> 28:48.759
sometimes I feel like
teaching's no better.

28:48.761 --> 28:50.394
- What, your kids
love you, miles.

28:50.396 --> 28:52.429
- Yeah, but they can't fire
the old shitty teachers,

28:52.431 --> 28:54.465
which is why I might not
have a job next year.

28:54.467 --> 28:54.465
These are the same
teachers that like,

28:54.467 --> 28:59.103
ream out a kid if they're
two seconds late for class,

28:59.105 --> 29:00.471
but they won't just
pull him aside,

29:00.473 --> 29:03.107
have a conversation
if he's flunking.

29:03.109 --> 29:03.107
- You might get laid off?

29:03.109 --> 29:07.211
- They fired everyone under
me, so I would be next.

29:07.213 --> 29:09.813
- Oh, god, I know it's hard.

29:10.815 --> 29:10.814
You gotta stick
with it, you know?

29:10.816 --> 29:13.417
It's really important
that there's teachers

29:13.419 --> 29:15.152
who actually care.

29:16.287 --> 29:16.286
- Yeah, but I don't
understand why you would ever

29:16.288 --> 29:19.356
get into teaching if you
don't like kids, you know?

29:19.358 --> 29:21.525
I mean, I feel like sometimes,

29:21.527 --> 29:24.762
my kids are the only
people I believe in.

29:24.764 --> 29:25.963
- What's up, fag?

29:25.965 --> 29:27.297
- Fuck you, you little shit.

29:27.299 --> 29:28.799
- Too bad your
girlfriend doesn't know

29:28.801 --> 29:30.000
that you're a fag.

29:30.002 --> 29:32.136
- Too bad I'm not
his girlfriend.

29:32.138 --> 29:34.438
- She does know he's a fag.

29:36.274 --> 29:37.307
- Couldn't you have
been my girlfriend

29:37.309 --> 29:37.307
for like two seconds?

29:37.309 --> 29:43.046
- Oh, sorry, I can be your
girlfriend for two seconds.

29:44.048 --> 29:46.083
- Whatever, I take it
back, fuck kids too.

29:46.085 --> 29:48.185
- Yeah, fuck kids.

29:48.187 --> 29:50.187
Man, you held your own though.

29:52.258 --> 29:52.256
I have bad news.

29:52.258 --> 29:56.326
Even though Nickelback at
the Wiltern is hideous,

29:56.328 --> 29:59.196
it can't be used for the
ugliest thing in Los Angeles.

29:59.198 --> 29:59.196
- Why not?

29:59.198 --> 29:59.196
- Because you've seen
a hundred shitty bands

29:59.198 --> 30:03.233
at the Wiltern, it has
to be something you've

30:03.235 --> 30:05.002
never seen before.

30:05.004 --> 30:06.136
- That sucks.

30:06.138 --> 30:07.938
- Game's still on.

30:13.178 --> 30:14.411
- It's weird, how many
people do you think

30:14.413 --> 30:14.411
live on this street
have any idea

30:14.413 --> 30:17.848
what kind of crazy shit
used to go down here?

30:17.850 --> 30:19.249
- Um, not a lot.

30:20.952 --> 30:22.186
- It's like this entire
area has had it's history

30:22.188 --> 30:24.555
completely erased,
does anybody care?

30:24.557 --> 30:27.491
- Jesus, miles,
yes, people care.

30:28.893 --> 30:31.061
Do the people of Koreatown
care, no, probably not.

30:31.063 --> 30:31.061
The people in Koreatown
are worried about

30:31.063 --> 30:35.365
putting food on the
table and cheap rent.

30:35.367 --> 30:36.967
- Koreans and
Mexicans don't care

30:36.969 --> 30:39.069
about history and culture, wow,

30:39.071 --> 30:43.006
there's nothing worse than a
well intentioned white person.

30:43.008 --> 30:45.442
- I'm just saying,
not everyone in la

30:45.444 --> 30:48.011
grew up with a dad who was
trying to turn them gay.

30:48.013 --> 30:49.279
- You know, I'm just
saying, why make history

30:49.281 --> 30:52.015
if no one's gonna remember it?

30:52.017 --> 30:53.383
- Do you need a hug?

30:53.385 --> 30:54.618
I feel like you need a hug.

30:54.620 --> 30:57.387
- I do, a hug would be nice.

30:59.457 --> 31:02.426
- Miles, it's not up to you
or I to save history today.

31:02.428 --> 31:05.128
Let's leave that up
to the la conservancy,

31:05.130 --> 31:07.231
they can be pissed about it.

31:07.233 --> 31:10.133
We've got too much
on our plates.

31:11.469 --> 31:13.403
- I'm a member of
the la conservancy.

31:13.405 --> 31:17.074
- Oh, of course you are.

31:41.133 --> 31:42.532
- Eric is calling?

31:42.534 --> 31:44.334
- Interesting.

31:44.336 --> 31:45.502
- I'll let you answer
it if you let me

31:45.504 --> 31:46.570
check my messages.

31:46.572 --> 31:48.138
- No phones today.

31:48.140 --> 31:49.273
- Who is he?

31:50.141 --> 31:51.608
- Just a guy that I was seeing.

31:51.610 --> 31:53.210
- What happened?

31:54.145 --> 31:55.145
- Nothing,

31:55.147 --> 31:58.682
uh, I don't know, I kind of
flaked on him a few times

31:58.684 --> 32:01.318
and he was really nice about it

32:01.320 --> 32:01.318
and said that I didn't
seem that into it

32:01.320 --> 32:05.589
and I should give him a
call when I wanted to rock.

32:05.591 --> 32:07.090
- He actually told
you to call him

32:07.092 --> 32:08.325
when you wanted to rock?

32:08.327 --> 32:10.260
That's awesome.

32:10.262 --> 32:11.461
Did you call him?

32:11.463 --> 32:13.196
- No, I respect the move though.

32:13.198 --> 32:14.464
- I respect the move,
I wanna call him

32:14.466 --> 32:14.464
and tell him I wanna rock.

32:14.466 --> 32:18.135
- It's all about the
timing, you know?

32:18.137 --> 32:20.337
Sometimes if things are
a few months earlier

32:20.339 --> 32:21.939
or a few months later,

32:21.941 --> 32:23.707
everything would
turn out differently,

32:23.709 --> 32:26.610
but, if the timing's off,
then the timing's off.

32:26.612 --> 32:28.211
- Did you see
Jeremy this morning?

32:28.213 --> 32:30.347
- Yeah, I saw him for a minute.

32:30.349 --> 32:30.347
- How'd that go?

32:30.349 --> 32:35.052
- Oh, god, we're fine,
whatever, it's cool.

32:37.956 --> 32:40.057
- He still talks
about you a lot.

32:40.059 --> 32:42.426
- Well, good for him.

32:42.428 --> 32:45.495
This morning he said, "we
should hang out like old times."

32:45.497 --> 32:46.964
- Wow.

32:46.966 --> 32:46.964
- Yeah.

32:46.966 --> 32:50.133
- You're not still
interested are you?

32:50.135 --> 32:50.133
- The guy who cheated on me?

32:50.135 --> 32:53.136
Yeah, I can't wait
to have his babies.

32:53.138 --> 32:55.372
- How'd you forgive him?

32:55.374 --> 32:56.606
- The first time?

32:56.608 --> 32:56.606
- Yeah.

32:56.608 --> 33:01.345
- The first time I pretended
like it never happened.

33:01.347 --> 33:03.613
- Yikes, that's hard.

33:03.615 --> 33:05.716
- The second time,
I dumped his ass

33:05.718 --> 33:09.186
and had sex with someone
with a much bigger dick.

33:09.188 --> 33:10.988
- So, I have to find a
woman with like a much

33:10.990 --> 33:11.989
bigger vagina?

33:11.991 --> 33:13.357
- No, opposite.

33:14.125 --> 33:15.058
- It doesn't work.

33:15.060 --> 33:16.259
- Tighter.

33:16.261 --> 33:16.259
- That's what I
was going to say.

33:16.261 --> 33:19.629
- Tighter is more revenge.

33:19.631 --> 33:21.999
- The tighter the better.

33:25.670 --> 33:27.371
- Hey, he doesn't
know that you're the one

33:27.373 --> 33:30.140
who told me that he was
cheating on me, right?

33:30.142 --> 33:33.543
- God, no, I hope
not, I mean, I never told him.

33:33.545 --> 33:33.543
- I don't remember what I said,

33:33.545 --> 33:37.614
oh, I said I could
see it in your eyes.

33:37.616 --> 33:39.149
I just stared at them and
said it like four times

33:39.151 --> 33:41.551
until he started to cry.

33:41.553 --> 33:43.186
He thinks I have esp.

33:43.188 --> 33:45.155
- He totally does, that's it.

33:45.157 --> 33:47.057
He keeps telling
me that he knows

33:47.059 --> 33:48.692
that you know that
he's thinking about you

33:48.694 --> 33:48.692
and then when you're ready,

33:48.694 --> 33:51.094
you're gonna come back.

33:51.096 --> 33:55.465
- Stop it.

33:55.467 --> 33:58.268
Tool.

34:24.562 --> 34:25.629
- Have any other
guys in your life

34:25.630 --> 34:27.764
other than rockin' Eric?

34:29.067 --> 34:30.766
- No, not really.

34:30.768 --> 34:33.637
You know,
relationship's are hard.

34:33.639 --> 34:36.206
- Tell me about it,
women are crazy.

34:36.208 --> 34:37.474
- Not what I meant.

34:37.476 --> 34:39.376
- Oh, well, it's true.

34:39.378 --> 34:43.612
- Nice, what did you mean
Becca, oh, thank you miles.

34:43.614 --> 34:47.384
What I meant was I'm
super picky, you know,

34:47.386 --> 34:49.085
and I know pretty quickly if I'm

34:49.088 --> 34:49.085
interested in someone or not

34:49.088 --> 34:54.123
and if I'm not, I don't wanna
waste their time or mine.

34:54.126 --> 34:54.123
Too many people get
into a relationship

34:54.126 --> 34:58.361
because it's convenient
or they're lonely.

34:58.363 --> 35:00.497
I don't want that to be me.

35:00.499 --> 35:03.400
- So you knew that
you weren't into Eric?

35:03.402 --> 35:05.368
- No, no, not necessarily.

35:05.370 --> 35:05.368
- So, you're not really
giving yourself a chance.

35:05.370 --> 35:08.505
- Yes, miles I'm giving
myself the chance.

35:08.507 --> 35:10.607
- Here you have a guy
who says the most awesome

35:10.609 --> 35:13.477
thing ever, call me
when you wanna rock,

35:13.479 --> 35:15.245
and you don't call him,
he obviously like you

35:15.247 --> 35:18.248
and this is the same guy you
just said two seconds ago

35:18.250 --> 35:19.883
you didn't know if
you liked him or not,

35:19.885 --> 35:22.152
so how's that giving
yourself a chance?

35:22.154 --> 35:23.620
- I don't know miles, you know,

35:23.622 --> 35:25.388
I've got a lot on
my plate right now.

35:25.390 --> 35:27.457
I'm moving to New York
maybe and I'm dealing

35:27.459 --> 35:29.826
with my dad, I just
feel like it went from

35:29.828 --> 35:31.528
taking care of my mom
to taking care of my dad

35:31.530 --> 35:33.196
and I don't have the
time or energy to

35:33.198 --> 35:35.532
take care of somebody
else right now.

35:35.534 --> 35:35.532
- A relationship
shouldn't be about

35:35.534 --> 35:35.532
taking care of somebody else,

35:35.534 --> 35:35.532
it should be about
the two of you

35:35.534 --> 35:40.704
taking care of each other.

35:40.706 --> 35:43.373
- Really, relationship advice?

35:43.375 --> 35:46.843
- Yeah, I guess I should talk.

35:46.845 --> 35:48.745
- I hear what you're
saying, I get it,

35:48.747 --> 35:50.814
it's just, I don't know,

35:50.816 --> 35:53.917
a relationship seems daunting.

35:53.919 --> 35:56.853
- I haven't been single
long, that seems daunting.

35:56.855 --> 36:00.490
- Do me a favor, if you
get back together with Sam,

36:00.492 --> 36:04.294
just don't do it because
you're afraid of being alone.

36:04.296 --> 36:06.429
I mean, you just turned 30,
your values going way up,

36:06.431 --> 36:09.733
mine's going in the
opposite direction.

36:14.705 --> 36:16.439
- Your aura's off.

36:17.441 --> 36:19.309
- Yeah, I've had kind of
like a rough week, so.

36:19.311 --> 36:20.677
- Not you, her.

36:21.812 --> 36:22.946
- Oh, you're talking about her?

36:22.948 --> 36:24.681
I agree.

36:24.683 --> 36:26.316
- What's wrong with my aura?

36:26.318 --> 36:27.284
- Beets.

36:27.286 --> 36:27.284
- What?

36:27.286 --> 36:31.221
- Beets, you need
to eat more beets.

36:31.223 --> 36:32.589
They're magical.

36:32.591 --> 36:33.591
- Beets.

36:34.592 --> 36:35.458
- Beets.

36:35.460 --> 36:36.526
- Thank you.

36:36.528 --> 36:38.261
- What about mine?

36:39.430 --> 36:41.631
- You're cool, man, good vibes.

36:41.633 --> 36:43.333
- Thanks, man.

36:43.335 --> 36:44.467
- Ugh.

36:44.469 --> 36:44.467
- He's the expert.

36:44.469 --> 36:48.238
- Yeah, I don't know
about that, thank you.

36:48.240 --> 36:48.905
- Beets.

36:48.907 --> 36:49.907
- Beets.

36:56.881 --> 36:58.682
Where are we headed?

36:58.684 --> 37:00.483
- The beet store, obviously.

37:00.485 --> 37:01.485
- Blow me.

37:06.390 --> 37:07.757
Where'd you go?

37:08.926 --> 37:12.495
- It's weird, it's
like, she was the one,

37:12.497 --> 37:14.364
she was the one I was
going to spend the

37:14.366 --> 37:16.466
rest of my life with, you know?

37:16.468 --> 37:17.934
A couple weeks ago,
everything was fine,

37:17.936 --> 37:21.871
now, it's not like I
think there's one person

37:23.641 --> 37:25.742
out of six billion that
I could be happy with,

37:25.744 --> 37:26.977
there's not a lot
of girls out there

37:26.979 --> 37:28.712
that aren't crazy.

37:29.914 --> 37:32.682
- Everybody's crazy, miles.

37:32.684 --> 37:35.919
People who aren't a little
bit crazy are boring.

37:35.921 --> 37:38.388
You just have to find someone
who's your type of crazy.

37:38.390 --> 37:40.523
- Sam was my kind of crazy.

37:40.525 --> 37:41.525
- How so?

37:43.261 --> 37:44.861
- She can like, shotgun
a beer faster than I can,

37:44.863 --> 37:47.797
she could speak
intelligently about every

37:47.799 --> 37:50.767
proposition in the
upcoming election.

37:50.769 --> 37:53.270
She knew every word
to "regulators".

37:53.272 --> 37:54.838
She makes me laugh.

37:56.307 --> 37:58.441
- So, the question is then,

37:58.443 --> 38:00.543
can you still trust her?

38:01.479 --> 38:02.812
- I don't know.

38:03.814 --> 38:06.750
- That's what you
gotta figure out.

38:15.993 --> 38:17.827
- I'm pathetic.

38:17.829 --> 38:17.827
- Why?

38:17.829 --> 38:22.465
- I read her fucking diary,
like, how sad is that?

38:22.467 --> 38:23.800
If I just didn't do that,

38:23.802 --> 38:26.770
everything would
be fine right now.

38:26.772 --> 38:28.305
- It's not your
finest moment, miles,

38:28.307 --> 38:29.906
but, we've all
done stupid things.

38:29.908 --> 38:31.308
I mean, you had a feeling
that something was wrong

38:31.310 --> 38:32.942
and you were right.

38:34.345 --> 38:35.545
- I gotta give her credit,

38:35.547 --> 38:36.413
she puts up with
a lot of my shit,

38:36.415 --> 38:36.413
I'm not clean.

38:36.415 --> 38:36.413
I get wasted with the boys,

38:36.415 --> 38:40.717
I come home and I
wake her up for sex,

38:40.719 --> 38:42.952
sweat profusely, I've got hair.

38:42.954 --> 38:44.654
- Okay, okay, okay, you're
literally describing

38:44.656 --> 38:46.489
every non-homosexual
man there is,

38:46.491 --> 38:49.326
so, let's not give her
props for liking men, okay?

38:49.328 --> 38:49.993
- Yeah, but she's like...

38:49.995 --> 38:49.993
- miles!

38:49.995 --> 38:53.530
You're amazing,
whoever you choose

38:53.532 --> 38:55.065
is gonna be incredibly lucky,

38:55.067 --> 38:56.466
whether it's Sam or not.

38:56.468 --> 38:58.601
You're smart, you're confident,

38:58.603 --> 39:01.638
you're really good
with kids and animals.

39:01.640 --> 39:03.473
You're an incessantly
positive person,

39:03.475 --> 39:05.809
you have an amazing
outlook on life,

39:05.811 --> 39:07.777
although maybe not
the last three days.

39:07.779 --> 39:10.080
You're, what else,
you're hilarious

39:10.082 --> 39:13.883
and you're sweet and
you're so talented.

39:13.885 --> 39:16.353
- Keep going, this is
great, I'm enjoying this.

39:16.355 --> 39:18.888
- I don't know, I'm just saying.

39:18.890 --> 39:21.124
Stop being such a bitch.

39:38.909 --> 39:42.779
- I'm actually surprised
we never hooked up.

39:43.681 --> 39:43.680
- Really?

39:43.682 --> 39:46.950
- I don't know, I don't
wanna make it awkward.

39:46.952 --> 39:48.485
- What did you mean to make it?

39:48.487 --> 39:50.787
- I just mean like,
considering all the

39:50.789 --> 39:53.390
drunken nights we spent
together in the last 15 years,

39:53.392 --> 39:54.457
you'd think, yeah, maybe
something like that

39:54.459 --> 39:55.959
could've happened.

39:55.961 --> 39:58.762
- We proved "when Harry
met Sally" wrong, go us.

39:58.764 --> 39:59.629
- Fist bump.

39:59.631 --> 40:00.631
- Hey.

40:03.868 --> 40:06.503
We did kiss one time though.

40:06.505 --> 40:11.174
I mean, it wasn't a big
deal, you were blackout.

40:11.176 --> 40:13.176
It was the summer
before senior year,

40:13.178 --> 40:16.579
we went up to Santa Barbara
for the flaming lips, remember?

40:16.581 --> 40:18.548
Jeremy and Nicole went
back into the bedroom

40:18.550 --> 40:21.918
to smoke pot and you
said, "if I spoke pot, I'm

40:21.920 --> 40:25.622
"gonna throw up all
over the world," so.

40:25.624 --> 40:25.622
I stayed out on the
balcony with you

40:25.624 --> 40:30.093
and then, you looked at
me and you gave me that

40:30.095 --> 40:33.096
same shit-eating grin that
you're doing right now

40:33.098 --> 40:37.033
and you said, "if we
kiss, then neither of us

40:38.469 --> 40:41.971
"would ever throw up again
for our entire lives,"

40:41.973 --> 40:43.973
and then you kissed me.

40:43.975 --> 40:43.973
- I wished I had been right.

40:43.975 --> 40:48.478
- Oh, my god, me too,
you threw up everywhere,

40:48.480 --> 40:50.880
over the balcony onto that woman
who was a few stories down,

40:50.882 --> 40:52.849
oh man, she was so pissed.

40:52.851 --> 40:52.849
- And I passed out and you
went back into the hotel

40:52.851 --> 40:57.987
into Jeremy's room and you
guys started dating after that.

40:57.989 --> 40:59.789
- Yeah, crazy night.

41:01.125 --> 41:01.991
- Can I tell you something?

41:01.993 --> 41:02.993
- Always.

41:04.595 --> 41:06.663
- I wasn't blacked out.

41:07.998 --> 41:09.999
- Dude, you were fucking gone.

41:10.001 --> 41:12.869
- But I wasn't blacked out.

41:12.871 --> 41:14.204
- You shit.

41:14.206 --> 41:16.706
- I had a crush on you.

41:16.708 --> 41:17.708
- What?

41:20.211 --> 41:20.210
You were dating Nicole.

41:20.212 --> 41:23.813
- Yeah, but that train was
coming to it's last stop,

41:23.815 --> 41:27.617
you know, we broke up
like four days later.

41:28.619 --> 41:29.953
- Why didn't you
ever say anything?

41:29.955 --> 41:31.488
- I was nervous.

41:31.490 --> 41:33.690
- No, miles, you were
not a nervous guy.

41:33.692 --> 41:35.091
- It's weird to take
something from the friend zone

41:35.093 --> 41:37.193
into the romantic zone.

41:37.195 --> 41:39.496
- Alright, well, good
to know that doesn't

41:39.498 --> 41:41.097
bother you anymore.

41:47.171 --> 41:52.041
- I don't know, whatever, it
was like a bunch of years ago,

41:52.043 --> 41:55.111
you know, I'm over it, you know.

41:55.113 --> 41:57.847
You remember that time,
it was like a few days

41:57.849 --> 41:59.749
before that trip where
you came over to my house?

41:59.751 --> 42:00.750
- Yeah.

42:00.752 --> 42:03.553
- Yeah, I made you that
bean dip and you said

42:03.555 --> 42:05.922
you had something
important to tell me?

42:05.924 --> 42:08.191
- I told you that I
had a crush on Jeremy.

42:08.193 --> 42:12.662
- Thought you were gonna tell
me you had a crush on me.

42:13.697 --> 42:16.299
- Oh, miles, I'm sorry.

42:16.301 --> 42:18.301
- Oh, my god, it was 13
years ago, I'm over it.

42:18.303 --> 42:21.704
- You always treated me like
I was your little sister.

42:21.706 --> 42:23.273
You used to give me noogies.

42:23.275 --> 42:25.808
- Yeah, it was total friend
zone back then, you know,

42:25.810 --> 42:27.577
but you grew on me.

42:29.213 --> 42:32.315
- Well, when did
you start liking me?

42:32.317 --> 42:34.684
- Middle of junior year,
I went to your house,

42:34.686 --> 42:36.085
I knocked on the door,
no one came to the door,

42:36.087 --> 42:38.021
so I just kind of walked around

42:38.023 --> 42:38.021
and looked in your window

42:38.023 --> 42:42.692
and I saw you just
painting, listening to music

42:42.694 --> 42:46.729
and I just watched for
like an hour and a half.

42:50.034 --> 42:51.968
- Creep, taxi!

42:51.970 --> 42:53.102
- Hilarious.

42:54.972 --> 42:55.972
- Wow.

42:56.807 --> 42:57.807
- Crazy.

42:58.842 --> 43:00.176
- That is crazy.

43:01.979 --> 43:05.648
I had a crush on you since
like the day I met you

43:05.650 --> 43:07.684
until I started dating Jeremy.

43:07.686 --> 43:07.684
- No way.

43:07.686 --> 43:10.954
- Way, of course I
had a crush on you,

43:10.956 --> 43:12.188
I've always had a crush on you.

43:12.190 --> 43:12.188
- No way.

43:12.190 --> 43:16.125
- Miles, I was the new
girl and you were the dorky

43:16.127 --> 43:19.596
funny guy who made me feel
at home, like right away,

43:19.598 --> 43:21.064
what wasn't there to like?

43:21.066 --> 43:22.365
- I'm not disagreeing with you,

43:22.367 --> 43:23.800
other than the dorky part.

43:25.270 --> 43:27.270
You know, I never knew.

43:27.272 --> 43:29.806
- I wasn't gonna tell you.

43:29.808 --> 43:29.806
- Crazy.

43:29.808 --> 43:32.609
- See, this is what
I mean, if our timing

43:32.611 --> 43:35.979
was a little
different, who knows?

43:35.981 --> 43:35.979
- Yeah, you could
have been the one

43:35.981 --> 43:38.281
cheating on me, I
could have been walking

43:38.283 --> 43:40.283
around with Sam all day.

43:40.285 --> 43:41.285
- Shut up.

43:45.656 --> 43:48.358
- In the world of affairs,
we live in our own age

43:48.360 --> 43:51.027
in books we live in all ages.

43:52.630 --> 43:55.932
La central library,
actually just named it

43:55.934 --> 43:58.968
the Richard Riordan library,

43:58.970 --> 44:01.738
could have called it the ray
Bradbury central library,

44:01.740 --> 44:01.738
I mean, he spent his
entire teenage years

44:01.740 --> 44:05.908
teaching himself
to write in here.

44:06.910 --> 44:10.980
Fahrenheit 451 versus
an old balding ex-mayor.

44:10.982 --> 44:12.315
Tough decision.

44:13.651 --> 44:15.351
- I like the la
central library best.

44:15.353 --> 44:18.021
- So do I, Riordan's
not even dead yet.

44:18.023 --> 44:19.288
You shouldn't be able
to have a building

44:19.290 --> 44:21.090
named after you
unless you're dead.

44:21.092 --> 44:22.925
- What if you're super awesome?

44:22.927 --> 44:22.925
- Well, then you would
know you're super awesome

44:22.927 --> 44:26.829
and you wouldn't need a fucking
building to tell you that.

44:26.831 --> 44:30.199
- I think I need a
building to tell me that.

44:30.201 --> 44:33.870
- Oh, for you, I shall
make an exception.

46:07.132 --> 46:08.765
- I love all the
light posts in la.

46:08.767 --> 46:10.767
- Yeah, they're pretty sweet.

46:10.769 --> 46:12.502
- They're so charming, you know?

46:12.504 --> 46:14.036
Each one's so
different and cool.

46:14.038 --> 46:15.505
- I've never really noticed.

46:15.507 --> 46:17.106
- You should start
noticing them.

46:17.108 --> 46:17.106
- Yeah, okay, I think I will.

46:17.108 --> 46:20.910
Can't use it as your most
beautiful thing though, right,

46:20.912 --> 46:20.910
you've already seen it.

46:20.912 --> 46:20.910
- I didn't say it was
my most beautiful thing.

46:20.912 --> 46:20.910
- Alright, just saying.

46:20.912 --> 46:26.349
- I'm just saying,
well, you should take

46:26.351 --> 46:28.451
care of yourself and
find your ugliest thing.

46:28.453 --> 46:30.386
- Okay, alright, I think I will.

46:30.388 --> 46:31.420
You're pretty ugly.

46:31.422 --> 46:32.288
- Nice.

46:32.290 --> 46:33.156
- Could be that.

46:33.158 --> 46:34.023
- You're uglier.

46:34.025 --> 46:35.025
Oh, burn.

46:36.493 --> 46:36.492
Ladies and gentlemen,

46:36.494 --> 46:41.464
it's a beautiful day
for a beautiful day.

46:41.466 --> 46:43.966
How you doin', sir?
- Wanna watch?

46:43.968 --> 46:46.469
Sit over here in the
mezzanine, c'mon.

46:46.471 --> 46:47.904
Who wants to dance?

46:47.906 --> 46:49.438
Who wants to dance?

46:49.440 --> 46:49.438
You wanna dance, sir?

46:49.440 --> 46:54.877
Come on, come on, bring
it back, bring it back.

46:56.079 --> 46:57.814
- Great seats.

46:57.816 --> 47:01.083
- There we go, there we go, ho!

47:01.085 --> 47:01.083
Improvised dance party.

47:01.085 --> 47:01.083
- He's pretty good actually.

47:01.085 --> 47:04.887
- He's really good.

47:05.889 --> 47:07.456
- You like men, you
like women, I'm looking

47:07.458 --> 47:10.459
for some ladies, but I
don't care, I don't care

47:10.461 --> 47:12.895
who's going down on me anymore.

47:12.897 --> 47:14.463
I used to care, not anymore,
I use my imagination

47:14.465 --> 47:17.867
and just imagine it's
a 20 year old girl

47:17.869 --> 47:21.537
that I met in telemcula
and then it's, boom!

47:22.372 --> 47:23.840
- She's on your cock.

47:23.842 --> 47:24.507
- Boom.

47:24.509 --> 47:24.507
- In and out.

47:24.509 --> 47:27.410
- Even though it's a
guy, it don't matter.

47:27.412 --> 47:28.911
It don't matter.

47:28.913 --> 47:30.112
- Is he coming?

47:30.114 --> 47:30.112
- Is he coming over here?

47:30.114 --> 47:30.112
- Is he coming?

47:30.114 --> 47:32.849
Yeah.

47:32.851 --> 47:34.150
- And he's here.

47:34.152 --> 47:35.084
- Hold this please.

47:35.086 --> 47:35.084
What time is it?

47:35.086 --> 47:38.621
Oh, I don't, maybe like 4:30?

47:40.524 --> 47:41.624
- I'm late.

47:49.366 --> 47:49.365
- Should we go?

47:49.367 --> 47:49.365
- Should we follow him?

47:49.367 --> 47:53.035
- Yeah, we should go.

48:03.580 --> 48:06.582
- What do you think
he's late for?

48:08.285 --> 48:10.486
Good with families and children,

48:10.488 --> 48:12.622
bad with parking meters.

48:36.046 --> 48:38.614
That's the ugliest thing in la.

48:39.483 --> 48:41.450
- More sad than ugly.

48:52.596 --> 48:53.596
Let's go.

49:03.273 --> 49:03.272
It's sad though, you
know, none of us are

49:03.274 --> 49:06.275
really that far from
sleeping on the street.

49:06.277 --> 49:07.543
- Speak for yourself,
I'm not conversing

49:07.545 --> 49:09.445
with a parking meter.

49:09.447 --> 49:12.348
- You've never talk to
an inanimate object?

49:12.350 --> 49:13.950
We all hear voices
in our head, miles.

49:13.952 --> 49:16.085
Crazy people just say
what they hear out loud,

49:16.087 --> 49:18.321
trying to keep them quiet.

49:18.323 --> 49:21.090
- Wow, I was not expecting
you to say something

49:21.092 --> 49:22.625
so profound, I actually
need a moment to like,

49:22.627 --> 49:23.960
process that.

49:23.962 --> 49:23.960
- Take your time.

49:23.962 --> 49:28.230
- Another difference
is they smell.

49:28.232 --> 49:30.666
- Did you not smell
yourself this morning?

49:30.668 --> 49:33.402
Have a little compassion.

49:33.404 --> 49:35.137
Ugh, my feet hurt.

49:36.606 --> 49:40.242
- Aw, poor baby, you
want, want me to,

49:40.244 --> 49:43.646
come on, come on, oh my god, ah,

49:43.648 --> 49:45.481
see how compassionate I'm being?

49:50.554 --> 49:53.556
- Where are we
going, do you know?

49:54.992 --> 49:58.461
- No, I don't,
I kinda like that.

49:58.463 --> 50:00.496
- Yeah, me too, I guess.

50:00.498 --> 50:00.496
- It's nice, being able

50:00.498 --> 50:00.496
to just like, enjoy the journey

50:00.498 --> 50:05.001
and not worry about
the destination.

50:05.003 --> 50:06.302
- You should
put that on a t-shirt.

50:06.304 --> 50:08.404
- We should.

50:08.406 --> 50:10.139
- Easier said than done.

50:10.141 --> 50:11.440
- No, I think we
could if we wanted to.

50:11.442 --> 50:11.440
- Yeah?

50:11.442 --> 50:11.440
- Yeah, like in Italy,
when I was living there,

50:11.442 --> 50:15.144
those people know how to live.

50:15.146 --> 50:15.144
- Tell me.

50:15.146 --> 50:15.144
- Priorities are
completely different.

50:15.146 --> 50:20.049
It starts out with
family then health

50:20.051 --> 50:23.152
then work, here it's
complete opposite.

50:23.154 --> 50:24.553
- Okay, so like, if
we were living today

50:24.555 --> 50:27.123
based solely on
Italian principles,

50:27.125 --> 50:27.123
what would today be like?

50:27.125 --> 50:27.123
- That's a good question.

50:27.125 --> 50:30.526
We'd move back in
with our parents.

50:30.528 --> 50:30.526
- Okay.

50:30.528 --> 50:30.526
- We'd watch a lot more soccer.

50:30.528 --> 50:30.526
We'd dress more fashionably.

50:30.528 --> 50:30.526
- Speak for yourself.

50:30.528 --> 50:37.767
- We would start using
olive oil instead of butter,

50:37.769 --> 50:38.701
drink more red wine.

50:38.703 --> 50:38.701
- Yeah.

50:38.703 --> 50:38.701
- You know, just
generally have more fun.

50:38.703 --> 50:42.705
- Yeah, that sounds awesome.

50:42.707 --> 50:42.705
- Right, Si, Si.

50:42.707 --> 50:48.144
- Si, I gotta move
in with your parents though.

51:37.594 --> 51:39.728
- Ready to give all
this up for New York?

51:39.730 --> 51:41.230
- I don't know, this
place is amazing.

51:41.232 --> 51:42.865
It's like the OG food court.

51:42.867 --> 51:45.267
- It's the best, this
whole street's the best.

51:45.269 --> 51:45.267
- What, Broadway?

51:45.269 --> 51:45.267
- Yeah, you can buy
stuff on Broadway for

51:45.269 --> 51:49.705
the same price they
sell for in Mexico.

51:49.707 --> 51:49.705
- Really?

51:49.707 --> 51:52.508
- Yeah, three hats, 10 bucks.

51:52.510 --> 51:54.110
- Are they made of flour?

51:54.112 --> 51:56.312
- Corn, actually.

51:56.314 --> 51:58.214
This whole place used
to be carne asada,

51:58.216 --> 52:00.616
pig heads, butcher
shops, now there's

52:00.618 --> 52:02.751
like a hipster juice bar.

52:02.753 --> 52:04.753
I hate hipsters.

52:04.755 --> 52:06.789
- Hate is a strong word, miles.

52:06.791 --> 52:08.691
- Don't give me your
bullshit compassion.

52:08.693 --> 52:10.659
These hipsters come in
and they like take over

52:10.661 --> 52:12.862
our authentic la, now
there's a urban outfitters

52:12.864 --> 52:15.898
and an Ace hotel on Broadway.

52:15.900 --> 52:18.868
- Would you rather the property
sits empty and languishes?

52:18.870 --> 52:22.605
- No, but they just think
they're so fucking cool.

52:22.607 --> 52:24.607
- You think you're
so fucking cool.

52:24.609 --> 52:25.674
- Yeah, but I can
just be cool by like

52:25.676 --> 52:28.177
showing people I'm cool,

52:28.179 --> 52:31.647
I don't need like
a fucking mustache.

52:31.649 --> 52:31.647
- Whatever miles,
you have a uniform

52:31.649 --> 52:33.849
the same as everybody else.

52:33.851 --> 52:34.850
- Do I?

52:34.852 --> 52:38.621
- Yeah, you shop at penguin,
you wear lucky jeans,

52:38.623 --> 52:40.523
you like ball caps and
you wear white t-shirts,

52:40.525 --> 52:42.158
I can name three guys
that dress just like you.

52:42.160 --> 52:43.459
- Please don't.

52:43.461 --> 52:45.728
- Just saying,
you're not special.

52:45.730 --> 52:48.697
- Wow, single tear
rolling down my cheek

52:48.699 --> 52:50.766
for the next three hours.

52:50.768 --> 52:52.568
- People who wear one
uniform, they love to look

52:52.570 --> 52:54.336
down on people who
wear another uniform,

52:54.338 --> 52:55.704
it's the human race.

52:55.706 --> 52:55.704
I know really cool hipsters,

52:55.706 --> 52:55.704
and I know super
douche hipsters,

52:55.706 --> 52:59.842
I know really cool guys
that dress like you,

52:59.844 --> 53:02.912
and I know super douches
that dress like you.

53:02.914 --> 53:02.912
That's the cool thing about la,

53:02.914 --> 53:06.315
it's like, no matter
what your uniform is,

53:06.317 --> 53:07.716
there's a neighborhood for you.

53:07.718 --> 53:09.451
- Yeah, but some
uniforms still suck.

53:09.453 --> 53:10.586
- Like what?

53:11.354 --> 53:13.189
- The Nazi uniform?

53:14.357 --> 53:16.592
- I don't know, guess I've
never met a cool Nazi,

53:16.594 --> 53:18.894
but uh, there's still time.

53:18.896 --> 53:21.830
- Ah, you like to
push my buttons.

53:21.832 --> 53:25.701
What's your uniform,
Ms. know-it-all.

53:25.703 --> 53:27.903
- I don't have a uniform.

53:31.575 --> 53:31.574
Oh!

53:31.576 --> 53:31.574
- There's your uniform.

53:31.576 --> 53:35.211
There's your uniform.

53:36.346 --> 53:38.581
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

54:57.662 --> 54:58.827
- I don't think there's
a song in it with whistling

54:58.829 --> 55:00.562
that I don't like,

55:00.564 --> 55:02.865
"Sittin' on The dock
of the bay", classic.

55:02.867 --> 55:04.400
- "Don't worry
be happy", classic.

55:04.402 --> 55:07.503
- "Stranger", Billy Joel.

55:07.505 --> 55:10.739
- "Daydream", lovin' spoonful.

55:10.741 --> 55:12.841
- There's more.

55:14.411 --> 55:14.410
- "Patience", guns n' roses.

55:14.412 --> 55:18.580
- Genius, no,
there's more, there's more.

55:18.582 --> 55:22.985
There's a, what's the
one, do do do do do do do.

55:22.987 --> 55:22.985
- What?

55:22.987 --> 55:28.457
- You know the one
that goes do do do do do do do.

55:29.426 --> 55:30.426
- Oh yeah, that
one, right, uh-huh.

55:30.428 --> 55:32.094
- I hate you.

55:32.096 --> 55:32.094
- No, you don't.

55:32.096 --> 55:34.496
- No, I do, kinda hate you.

55:34.498 --> 55:36.365
- No, you love me.

55:36.367 --> 55:36.365
- I'm pretty sure I hate you.

55:36.367 --> 55:36.365
By the way, I've seen a
lot of beautiful things

55:36.367 --> 55:42.838
in Los Angeles today, when
are we crowning a champion?

55:42.840 --> 55:44.006
- Oh, I saw the most
beautiful thing,

55:44.008 --> 55:45.641
like, an hour ago.

55:45.643 --> 55:45.641
- You didn't show me anything.

55:45.643 --> 55:45.641
- That wasn't part of
the rules, we said you

55:45.643 --> 55:49.945
had to find it,
you assume that we

55:49.947 --> 55:49.945
had to share with each other.

55:49.947 --> 55:52.481
- That's so lame, of
course we have share

55:52.483 --> 55:53.882
it with each other.

55:53.884 --> 55:55.617
You didn't see anything.

55:55.619 --> 55:57.086
- Yes, I did.

55:57.088 --> 55:58.487
- What did you see?

55:58.489 --> 55:58.487
- Not sure if I wanna tell you.

55:58.489 --> 56:01.390
- You didn't see shit.

56:03.660 --> 56:07.429
- I saw an older lady sitting
in a flimsy folding chair

56:07.431 --> 56:11.633
in the middle of the sidewalk
knitting herself a scarf.

56:11.635 --> 56:12.635
- And?

56:14.037 --> 56:16.038
- And, you wonder why I don't
wanna tell you anything.

56:16.040 --> 56:17.639
- I'm listening.

56:17.641 --> 56:22.010
- She was just sitting there,
not waiting for anything,

56:22.012 --> 56:26.382
not the bus, not the Metro,
she was just sitting,

56:26.950 --> 56:29.385
knitting, doing her thing.

56:30.587 --> 56:32.721
- Why is that beautiful?

56:33.556 --> 56:34.623
- I thought it was peaceful.

56:34.625 --> 56:35.624
- How so?

56:35.626 --> 56:40.129
- She was just doing
something for herself.

56:40.131 --> 56:44.600
She was doing something to
bring herself some peace.

56:44.602 --> 56:46.468
I thought it was beautiful.

56:46.470 --> 56:48.670
- I get it, I get it.

56:48.672 --> 56:52.941
I mean, I don't think it
wins the day, but I get it.

56:59.549 --> 56:59.548
- Thank you.

56:59.550 --> 57:02.718
- You ever see
a pbr tallboy in a can?

57:02.720 --> 57:02.718
- What am I, an infant?

57:02.720 --> 57:05.821
- It's a thing of beauty.

57:05.823 --> 57:06.823
Cheers.

57:13.096 --> 57:15.531
- How are your folks?

57:15.533 --> 57:16.799
- They're great,
yeah, they've been up

57:16.801 --> 57:18.700
to my aunt's house
in San Francisco.

57:18.702 --> 57:21.103
- Oh, that's so cool, they're
always doing fun stuff.

57:21.105 --> 57:23.872
- Yeah, they literally had
a water fight the other day.

57:23.874 --> 57:23.872
- That's so awesome.

57:23.874 --> 57:27.042
- Yeah, the relationship
kind of simultaneously

57:27.044 --> 57:28.710
makes me feel like
a failure in love

57:28.712 --> 57:31.213
but also that you know,
there's hope that somebody

57:31.215 --> 57:32.748
I'll have what they have.

57:32.750 --> 57:35.184
- You will, it's
all gonna work out.

57:35.186 --> 57:36.452
- Will it?

57:36.454 --> 57:38.220
- I think it will.

57:38.222 --> 57:39.488
- I mean, there's a chance that

57:39.490 --> 57:39.488
it doesn't work out, right?

57:39.490 --> 57:42.090
That's a possibility.

57:42.092 --> 57:45.727
- Yes, there's a possibility
that it won't work out.

57:45.729 --> 57:47.229
- It's weird, it's like
when we tell people

57:47.231 --> 57:49.765
it'll all work out,
how do we know?

57:49.767 --> 57:52.868
- We don't, you just
lie to them to make them

57:52.870 --> 57:54.570
feel better about it,
but I'm not talking about

57:54.572 --> 57:56.472
the situation, I'm
talking about you

57:56.474 --> 57:59.708
because I know you,
you're a survivor.

58:00.743 --> 58:03.879
Shit's gonna get thrown
at us our whole lives.

58:03.881 --> 58:03.879
You gotta deal with it.

58:03.881 --> 58:07.916
You take it in and you
laugh, you cry, you learn

58:07.918 --> 58:10.586
what you can and you move on.

58:16.693 --> 58:19.495
- Is that the lamp from
"a Christmas story"?

58:19.497 --> 58:21.029
That is the most
beautiful thing in la.

58:21.031 --> 58:23.765
- Okay, that can be
your most beautiful thing.

58:23.767 --> 58:24.900
- It's so much better than

58:24.902 --> 58:25.767
your most beautiful thing.

58:25.769 --> 58:27.069
- Oh, whatever.

58:33.676 --> 58:35.177
What am I gonna do miles?

58:35.179 --> 58:37.112
- What am I gonna do?

58:40.684 --> 58:41.684
Waterfall?

58:43.186 --> 58:44.820
- What did you just say?

58:44.822 --> 58:44.820
- Waterfall?

58:44.822 --> 58:47.789
- Oh, man, I haven't
done a waterfall...

58:47.791 --> 58:49.925
- I feel like we
need a waterfall.

58:49.927 --> 58:50.926
- Really?

58:50.928 --> 58:50.926
- I'm prepared to go
against everything

58:50.928 --> 58:56.098
tlc taught me and start
chasing me some waterfalls.

58:56.100 --> 58:57.100
Waterfall!

59:49.052 --> 59:50.719
- oh, whoa, whoa, whoa,
let me help you guys

59:50.721 --> 59:52.087
out here with these.

59:52.089 --> 59:52.087
- Bro, don't touch me bro.

59:52.089 --> 59:57.225
- Don't touch me, bro.

59:58.227 --> 01:00:00.329
Sam's calling, do
you wanna answer it?

01:00:00.331 --> 01:00:01.597
- Nah, fuck it.

01:00:01.599 --> 01:00:02.931
- You sure?

01:00:02.933 --> 01:00:04.266
- Yeah.

01:00:07.370 --> 01:00:08.971
- Why don't we skip anymore?

01:00:08.973 --> 01:00:11.006
- Oh, guys don't skip,
guys don't skip, okay?

01:00:11.008 --> 01:00:12.908
We freestyle walk.

01:00:12.910 --> 01:00:12.908
- Freestyle walk?

01:00:12.910 --> 01:00:18.780
- Yeah, freestyle walk,
check it, look at this.

01:00:18.782 --> 01:00:18.780
You like that?

01:00:18.782 --> 01:00:22.618
- Wow, bravo,
bravo, yeah, I see.

01:00:23.886 --> 01:00:25.387
Not any woman could
do a sport like that,

01:00:25.389 --> 01:00:27.289
it takes the strength, right?

01:00:27.291 --> 01:00:28.624
- Oh yeah, no, I've been
working on my leg muscles

01:00:28.626 --> 01:00:28.624
for years.

01:00:28.626 --> 01:00:31.326
- Luckily, I am not any woman.

01:00:31.328 --> 01:00:32.361
- Wait, are you gonna?

01:00:32.363 --> 01:00:32.361
Are you gonna?

01:00:32.363 --> 01:00:35.130
Do it at your own risk.

01:00:35.132 --> 01:00:36.131
I can't promise you're not gonna

01:00:36.133 --> 01:00:37.299
get seriously injured.

01:00:37.301 --> 01:00:38.634
- Alright, ready?

01:00:38.636 --> 01:00:39.901
- Oh, god.

01:00:39.903 --> 01:00:40.903
- Oh.

01:00:42.238 --> 01:00:44.006
- Toe tap?

01:00:44.008 --> 01:00:45.173
- Just the toe tap.

01:00:45.175 --> 01:00:45.173
- That's amateur hour.

01:00:45.175 --> 01:00:47.643
- What, I didn't see you do it.

01:00:47.645 --> 01:00:48.910
- I didn't wanna
show you anything

01:00:48.912 --> 01:00:50.245
you couldn't handle.

01:00:50.247 --> 01:00:51.413
- Oh, anything I
can't handle, right?

01:00:51.415 --> 01:00:51.413
- Yeah.

01:00:51.415 --> 01:00:51.413
- Alright, why don't you show me

01:00:51.415 --> 01:00:51.413
something I can's handle.

01:00:51.415 --> 01:00:51.413
- Oh, you wanna see
something you can't handle?

01:00:51.415 --> 01:00:51.413
- Yeah.

01:00:51.415 --> 01:00:57.319
- Back up a little bit.

01:00:57.321 --> 01:00:58.920
- Oh, excuse me.

01:01:00.056 --> 01:01:00.989
- Oh.

01:01:00.991 --> 01:01:00.989
- Oh why...

01:01:00.991 --> 01:01:02.958
- Oh, my nuts!

01:01:02.960 --> 01:01:05.193
Oh, fuck you, meter!

01:01:05.195 --> 01:01:05.193
Fuck you.

01:01:05.195 --> 01:01:09.364
- Now, who's yelling
at the parking meters?

01:01:09.366 --> 01:01:11.033
Are you alright?

01:01:11.035 --> 01:01:13.402
Oh, that hurt my nuts.

01:01:13.404 --> 01:01:16.204
- What is this, what
is happening, this is awesome.

01:01:16.206 --> 01:01:19.775
- This is art walk,
wait, the vice-mayor of la

01:01:19.777 --> 01:01:19.775
has never been to art walk?

01:01:19.777 --> 01:01:22.277
- I've always wanted to
come down to art walk,

01:01:22.279 --> 01:01:23.211
I've just never made it.

01:01:23.213 --> 01:01:24.880
This is awesome.

01:01:24.882 --> 01:01:24.880
- Welcome.

01:01:24.882 --> 01:01:24.880
- Have you ever
had anything shown here?

01:01:24.882 --> 01:01:24.880
- Nope.

01:01:24.882 --> 01:01:30.152
- Oh, so you're
gonna move to New York

01:01:30.154 --> 01:01:30.152
to open up a gallery, when
you could just do it here?

01:01:30.154 --> 01:01:32.254
- That is the dilemma.

01:01:32.256 --> 01:01:33.955
- What's the dilemma?

01:01:33.957 --> 01:01:36.892
- Well, imagine
this but everyday,

01:01:36.894 --> 01:01:39.761
not just once a month,
that is New York.

01:01:39.763 --> 01:01:41.697
- This could be everyday.

01:01:41.699 --> 01:01:42.931
This could be
everyday, it would just

01:01:42.933 --> 01:01:44.099
take a little bit
of time, you know,

01:01:44.101 --> 01:01:45.133
but you'd be part of something.

01:01:45.135 --> 01:01:46.201
- Yeah!

01:01:46.203 --> 01:01:47.069
- Yeah!

01:01:47.071 --> 01:01:47.069
- Yeah!

01:01:47.071 --> 01:01:49.471
- Be the soundtrack.

01:01:49.473 --> 01:01:51.940
- You got the iPod, DJ Tanner.

01:01:51.942 --> 01:01:53.008
Turn it up.

01:02:44.294 --> 01:02:45.227
- follow me?

01:02:45.229 --> 01:02:46.762
- Oh my gosh, hi.

01:02:46.764 --> 01:02:46.762
What are you doing here?

01:02:46.764 --> 01:02:50.232
- What am I doing here,
these are my photos.

01:02:50.234 --> 01:02:53.235
- No way, aw, these
are beautiful.

01:02:53.237 --> 01:02:53.235
- Thanks yeah, I
called you earlier

01:02:53.237 --> 01:02:58.340
to invite you out, glad
you decided you wanna rock.

01:02:58.342 --> 01:03:02.778
- Yeah, I'm glad
I'm here too, actually.

01:03:04.046 --> 01:03:07.783
I'm here with miles, my oldest
friend from high school.

01:03:07.785 --> 01:03:07.783
Miles!

01:03:07.785 --> 01:03:07.783
- Pleasure to meet you, miles.

01:03:07.785 --> 01:03:07.783
- Miles!

01:03:07.785 --> 01:03:12.521
- Hey, nice to meet you, man.

01:03:12.523 --> 01:03:14.055
Really cool work.

01:03:14.057 --> 01:03:15.423
- Yeah, thanks.

01:03:16.526 --> 01:03:16.525
- I'm gonna go to the bathroom,

01:03:16.527 --> 01:03:18.927
you guys want
something to drink or?

01:03:18.929 --> 01:03:18.927
- Oh, wine?

01:03:18.929 --> 01:03:23.932
- Yeah, none for me,
no drinking on the job.

01:03:27.103 --> 01:03:29.471
- Uh, when did you do Higby's?

01:03:29.473 --> 01:03:31.039
- When did you get so sexy?

01:04:35.404 --> 01:04:35.403
- There you are.

01:04:35.405 --> 01:04:35.403
I couldn't find you,
I was looking for you,

01:04:35.405 --> 01:04:39.241
then you disappeared.

01:04:39.243 --> 01:04:41.543
- I just wanted to get
a breath of fresh air.

01:04:41.545 --> 01:04:43.144
- You ready to go?

01:04:43.146 --> 01:04:44.880
- Yeah, I'll go, I
mean, I don't wanna

01:04:44.882 --> 01:04:47.282
get in the way of
whatever you guys.

01:04:47.284 --> 01:04:48.450
- Oh yeah, no, not at all.

01:04:48.452 --> 01:04:50.185
We're gonna get coffee tomorrow.

01:04:50.187 --> 01:04:53.922
I had no idea his stuff
was so good, loved it.

01:04:53.924 --> 01:04:54.924
- Cool.

01:05:07.036 --> 01:05:09.337
Wish we could just get on
the trolley and go home.

01:05:09.339 --> 01:05:09.337
The trolley used
to run all the way

01:05:09.339 --> 01:05:09.337
from downtown to the beach.

01:05:09.339 --> 01:05:13.575
- Yeah, relax miles, I
saw "Roger rabbit" too.

01:05:13.577 --> 01:05:14.577
- What is that?

01:05:16.946 --> 01:05:20.248
- Oh, that is the
new-ish catholic church.

01:05:20.250 --> 01:05:20.248
- That's it?

01:05:20.250 --> 01:05:22.450
- That's it.

01:05:22.452 --> 01:05:24.452
- Jesus, that's ugly.

01:05:24.454 --> 01:05:26.588
- I don't know,
it's not that bad.

01:05:26.590 --> 01:05:26.588
- Catholic architecture's
supposed to

01:05:26.590 --> 01:05:30.492
make you feel like, closer
to god or something?

01:05:30.494 --> 01:05:31.559
- Yeah, I think that was
the original intention

01:05:31.561 --> 01:05:33.595
in the middle ages, yeah.

01:05:33.597 --> 01:05:35.297
- It makes me wanna
closer to home depot,

01:05:35.299 --> 01:05:36.932
did they even finish sanding it?

01:05:36.934 --> 01:05:39.401
- Be nice, I read that
it's gorgeous inside.

01:05:39.403 --> 01:05:39.401
- Be nice?

01:05:39.403 --> 01:05:39.401
Do you think I should be
nice to the catholic church,

01:05:39.403 --> 01:05:39.401
I'm not allowed to be nice
to the catholic church,

01:05:39.403 --> 01:05:47.042
they're basically the biggest
organized crime syndicate

01:05:47.044 --> 01:05:49.611
in the Atlantic,
they're worse than fifa.

01:05:49.613 --> 01:05:51.012
- You're just shitting
on the architecture

01:05:51.014 --> 01:05:52.080
because it's a catholic church.

01:05:52.082 --> 01:05:54.215
- No, no, it's also ugly.

01:06:20.643 --> 01:06:24.546
- I thought it was
peaceful in there.

01:06:24.548 --> 01:06:28.049
I mean, I agree, the
outside kind of, is weird,

01:06:28.051 --> 01:06:30.518
but I liked it inside.

01:06:30.520 --> 01:06:32.087
- It's so ugly.

01:06:34.090 --> 01:06:34.089
- I don't mind it not being

01:06:34.091 --> 01:06:38.493
so flashy on the
outside, you know?

01:06:38.495 --> 01:06:40.128
I think that's what
true religion is,

01:06:40.130 --> 01:06:41.463
you don't have to flaunt
it on the outside,

01:06:41.465 --> 01:06:43.098
you just be beautiful
on the inside.

01:06:43.100 --> 01:06:44.265
- Right, 'cause that's
the catholic church's mo,

01:06:44.267 --> 01:06:46.301
not flaunting it.

01:06:46.303 --> 01:06:50.572
- I think in this case,
yeah, that's the way it is.

01:06:53.409 --> 01:06:54.776
I wanna get something
from the gift shop,

01:06:54.778 --> 01:06:57.245
do you want a drink?

01:06:57.247 --> 01:06:59.714
- Gift shop, yep,
it's a perfect example

01:06:59.716 --> 01:07:01.649
of how the catholic church
really cares about people's

01:07:01.651 --> 01:07:04.052
inner spirituality.

01:07:04.054 --> 01:07:05.353
- Jesus, miles.

01:07:05.355 --> 01:07:07.288
- My thoughts exactly.

01:07:07.290 --> 01:07:09.290
- You're being a dick.

01:07:09.292 --> 01:07:10.458
- I'm sorry, did
you wanna buy like a

01:07:10.460 --> 01:07:12.460
four dollar bottle of water?

01:07:12.462 --> 01:07:15.263
Do you wanna buy like
a $300 chintzy cross?

01:07:15.265 --> 01:07:17.665
Fuckin' go for it, they
buy that shit on Broadway.

01:07:17.667 --> 01:07:17.665
That's what organized
religion does,

01:07:17.667 --> 01:07:20.435
they buy it over there,
and they bring it in here

01:07:20.437 --> 01:07:22.037
and they mark it up.

01:07:22.039 --> 01:07:22.037
They sell it to suckers,

01:07:22.039 --> 01:07:22.037
don't get mad at me 'cause
I buy my shit on Broadway.

01:07:22.039 --> 01:07:22.037
- I'm mad at you
because you're being

01:07:22.039 --> 01:07:28.710
completely insensitive
and close-minded.

01:07:28.712 --> 01:07:30.445
- Since when did you
become a fucking apologist

01:07:30.447 --> 01:07:32.047
for the organization
that caused more wars

01:07:32.049 --> 01:07:33.448
than anybody else in
the history of the world

01:07:33.450 --> 01:07:36.284
and fucking protects pedophiles?

01:07:36.286 --> 01:07:37.719
- I'm not an apologist, miles.

01:07:37.721 --> 01:07:40.355
Have you ever heard
of mother Teresa?

01:07:40.357 --> 01:07:42.424
She was catholic and
she's fucking real.

01:07:42.426 --> 01:07:43.491
- Oh my god, how
can you buy into the

01:07:43.493 --> 01:07:45.727
catholic church's line of BS?

01:07:45.729 --> 01:07:48.730
When did you become
so religious?

01:07:48.732 --> 01:07:48.730
- I'm not religious, miles,

01:07:48.732 --> 01:07:52.267
but I respect other
people who are.

01:07:52.269 --> 01:07:52.267
It's called respecting
other people's

01:07:52.269 --> 01:07:55.503
beliefs and opinions, even if
they're different from yours.

01:07:55.505 --> 01:07:56.638
- Yeah, but you have
to be a fucking moron

01:07:56.640 --> 01:07:58.373
to buy into their line of BS.

01:07:58.375 --> 01:08:00.208
You know what, if
your bullshit meter

01:08:00.210 --> 01:08:02.844
is like that faulty, then,
maybe you should just

01:08:02.846 --> 01:08:05.180
start rethinking
everything, 'cause I don't

01:08:05.182 --> 01:08:05.180
think you're gonna
survive in New York.

01:08:05.182 --> 01:08:05.180
Like, if you can get
duped by a bunch of

01:08:05.182 --> 01:08:09.150
70 year old white guys in Rome,

01:08:09.152 --> 01:08:10.485
I don't think any
new yorker is gonna

01:08:10.487 --> 01:08:12.487
pay shit for your art.

01:08:14.356 --> 01:08:18.193
- Maybe you should
rethink everything, miles.

01:08:18.194 --> 01:08:18.193
'Cause you know
everything there is

01:08:18.194 --> 01:08:18.193
to know about la, right,

01:08:18.194 --> 01:08:22.564
but you don't know
shit about yourself.

01:08:22.566 --> 01:08:25.200
Wah, wah, wah, my fiance
is cheating on me,

01:08:25.202 --> 01:08:26.701
I hate being a teacher,
I'm gonna go cry

01:08:26.703 --> 01:08:28.236
in my mom's bed for three days.

01:08:28.238 --> 01:08:31.372
You know what, I
don't have that.

01:08:31.374 --> 01:08:34.274
I don't have mommy's
shoulder to cry on.

01:08:34.277 --> 01:08:36.243
Do you ever hear me
complaining about life ever?

01:08:36.246 --> 01:08:37.645
No, because I'm too
busy fucking taking

01:08:37.647 --> 01:08:37.645
care of everybody else, miles.

01:08:37.647 --> 01:08:41.316
I take care of my mom, and
then I took care of my dad

01:08:41.318 --> 01:08:43.751
and now I'm here fucking
taking care of you,

01:08:43.752 --> 01:08:47.322
when do I ever have time
to take care of myself,

01:08:47.323 --> 01:08:48.723
and yeah, I might go
to New York and I might

01:08:48.725 --> 01:08:50.390
fucking fall on my ass,

01:08:50.393 --> 01:08:51.392
but you know what,
at least I'll know

01:08:51.394 --> 01:08:51.392
that I fucking tried.

01:08:51.394 --> 01:08:51.392
I can look myself in the
mirror at the end of the day

01:08:51.394 --> 01:08:55.697
and say, at least I'm
not a giant fucking pussy

01:08:55.698 --> 01:08:58.899
like miles, at least
I fucking tried.

01:09:00.402 --> 01:09:04.439
- I didn't fucking ask
for you to come today.

01:09:04.441 --> 01:09:06.441
I didn't ask for any of this.

01:09:06.443 --> 01:09:06.441
- Miles.

01:09:06.443 --> 01:09:08.176
- No, game's over.

01:09:08.178 --> 01:09:09.178
Fuck it.

01:09:10.679 --> 01:09:12.447
- Miles.

01:09:12.448 --> 01:09:14.249
- Fuck off.

01:09:15.718 --> 01:09:20.188
- Please, can we
just, go, please, together?

01:10:02.799 --> 01:10:03.665
- give me my phone.

01:10:03.667 --> 01:10:03.665
- No.

01:10:03.667 --> 01:10:03.665
- Becca, give me my
phone, game's over.

01:10:03.667 --> 01:10:08.536
- Now you wanna talk to her?

01:10:09.471 --> 01:10:09.470
- You did not just do that.

01:10:09.472 --> 01:10:11.873
You did not just throw
my phone into the lake.

01:10:11.875 --> 01:10:14.509
- Go fish it out and see.

01:10:14.511 --> 01:10:14.509
- Okay.

01:10:14.511 --> 01:10:17.378
- No, no, no, don't.

01:10:20.250 --> 01:10:21.716
You're gonna feel
like shit for that.

01:10:21.718 --> 01:10:21.716
- You know what, it's impossible

01:10:21.718 --> 01:10:26.621
to feel any shittier than
you're making me feel right now.

01:10:26.623 --> 01:10:27.822
Last thing I wanted
to do was burden

01:10:27.824 --> 01:10:29.457
anybody with my problems, okay?

01:10:29.459 --> 01:10:31.960
Remember, you came to me today,

01:10:31.962 --> 01:10:33.261
I didn't ask for you,

01:10:33.263 --> 01:10:34.729
I didn't ask for this day

01:10:34.731 --> 01:10:37.599
and I'm still not asking for it.

01:10:48.310 --> 01:10:49.777
- Miles, it's me.

01:10:51.247 --> 01:10:55.383
Look, I cheated but I
didn't have sex with him,

01:10:55.385 --> 01:10:57.518
we just got drunk in
a bar and made out

01:10:57.520 --> 01:10:59.387
with some guy, I
don't even know.

01:10:59.389 --> 01:11:01.656
It was really stupid
and I was really drunk

01:11:01.658 --> 01:11:03.324
and I'm so sorry.

01:11:04.827 --> 01:11:07.428
I know we can work this out.

01:11:08.530 --> 01:11:12.500
Call me back because I
love you so much, bye.

01:11:30.019 --> 01:11:31.753
- There's something
that I never,

01:11:31.755 --> 01:11:34.355
I've never told anyone, but,

01:11:38.627 --> 01:11:41.963
my mom wasn't very
religious, you know?

01:11:41.965 --> 01:11:45.433
But, at the end of
the last few months

01:11:46.302 --> 01:11:48.303
right before she died,

01:11:50.572 --> 01:11:53.441
she started talking to a priest.

01:11:56.612 --> 01:11:58.446
In Bolvo, she was at her weakest

01:11:58.448 --> 01:12:00.581
from the chemotherapy and

01:12:03.319 --> 01:12:05.386
she was in so much pain

01:12:06.388 --> 01:12:09.824
and she was withering
away before my eyes.

01:12:13.529 --> 01:12:17.799
It's the only thing that
gave her a sense of hope.

01:12:21.704 --> 01:12:23.805
So maybe it's bullshit,
miles, maybe it's bullshit,

01:12:23.807 --> 01:12:25.540
I don't know, but,

01:12:26.975 --> 01:12:30.011
it made her feel
better about dying

01:12:34.016 --> 01:12:37.652
and for that I will
always be grateful.

01:12:37.654 --> 01:12:41.489
- I'm sorry, sorry
about everything I said.

01:12:51.633 --> 01:12:54.902
Sam wanted to get
married at that church.

01:12:54.904 --> 01:12:55.904
I said no.

01:13:04.780 --> 01:13:06.581
Ah, well, we've
bussed, we've walked,

01:13:06.583 --> 01:13:08.683
we've subwayed
all over the city,

01:13:08.685 --> 01:13:09.884
you know one thing
we haven't done?

01:13:09.886 --> 01:13:09.884
- What?

01:13:09.886 --> 01:13:13.054
- Paddle boat, paddle boat.

01:13:14.790 --> 01:13:15.790
How nice is this?

01:13:18.027 --> 01:13:19.394
My dad grew up
right around here.

01:13:19.396 --> 01:13:19.394
- Where?

01:13:19.396 --> 01:13:21.829
- Angelino heights.

01:13:21.831 --> 01:13:22.697
- Oh yeah?

01:13:22.699 --> 01:13:24.132
- Yeah.

01:13:24.134 --> 01:13:26.701
It's where the house
from charmed is.

01:13:26.703 --> 01:13:28.436
- You watched charmed?

01:13:36.545 --> 01:13:40.047
- Ah, Angelino heights,
I've got porch envy already.

01:13:40.049 --> 01:13:40.047
- Porch envy?

01:13:40.049 --> 01:13:40.047
- Yeah, I love porches.

01:13:40.049 --> 01:13:40.047
- Since when?

01:13:40.049 --> 01:13:40.047
- Remember my
apartment in college?

01:13:40.049 --> 01:13:45.520
2414, great porch,
people would just stop by

01:13:45.522 --> 01:13:50.591
and barbecue, drink beers,
porches bring people together.

01:13:50.593 --> 01:13:50.591
- Interesting.

01:13:50.593 --> 01:13:53.094
- My dad grew up
right around this corner,

01:13:53.096 --> 01:13:54.729
wanna check it out?

01:13:54.731 --> 01:13:56.097
- Yeah.

01:14:01.438 --> 01:14:02.870
Ooh, this looks
like a cool party,

01:14:02.872 --> 01:14:02.870
sounds like they have a band.

01:14:02.872 --> 01:14:02.870
- Come on, my dad's
house is a couple down.

01:14:02.872 --> 01:14:02.870
- Screw your
dad, let's go dance.

01:14:02.872 --> 01:14:07.875
- We don't know
anybody in there.

01:14:07.877 --> 01:14:09.076
- So?

01:14:10.112 --> 01:14:11.813
- Hipsters.

01:14:11.815 --> 01:14:15.983
- Come on, it
sounds like robot gangbang.

01:14:44.647 --> 01:14:47.181
- these hipsters fucking rock.

01:14:55.491 --> 01:14:56.624
- holy shit.

01:14:56.626 --> 01:14:57.925
- What?

01:14:57.927 --> 01:15:00.027
- Houston, it's Houston.

01:15:01.630 --> 01:15:03.498
- Holy shit.

01:15:10.874 --> 01:15:12.507
- Houston!

01:15:12.509 --> 01:15:13.509
- Houston!

01:15:15.611 --> 01:15:18.145
You remember us, from the bus?

01:15:19.548 --> 01:15:22.783
- Oh, yeah, sorry
I was being a dick,

01:15:24.720 --> 01:15:26.120
I just had to take a shit.

01:15:26.122 --> 01:15:26.120
- It's all good.

01:15:26.122 --> 01:15:29.190
- It's all good now, yeah.

01:15:29.192 --> 01:15:31.792
So, who do you guys
know over here?

01:15:31.794 --> 01:15:31.792
- You.

01:15:31.794 --> 01:15:34.929
- Yeah, let's party, yeah!

01:15:48.177 --> 01:15:51.078
- you, you are
adorbs, oh my god,

01:15:51.947 --> 01:15:54.682
your hair is amazing, so soft.

01:15:55.651 --> 01:15:57.752
It smells like cotton
candy, I love it.

01:15:57.754 --> 01:15:58.819
Can we make out?

01:15:58.821 --> 01:15:58.819
- Maybe later.

01:15:58.821 --> 01:16:03.658
- Oh my god, I'm gonna
be your best friend.

01:16:05.961 --> 01:16:05.960
- I hope you weren't planning on

01:16:05.962 --> 01:16:08.563
talking to your
friend much tonight,

01:16:08.565 --> 01:16:08.563
looks like girl fell in love.

01:16:08.565 --> 01:16:12.266
- It's all good, I think
she needs a miles break.

01:16:12.268 --> 01:16:13.601
- I'm Sarah.

01:16:13.603 --> 01:16:14.936
- I'm miles.

01:16:14.938 --> 01:16:16.103
- I kinda got that.

01:16:53.742 --> 01:16:55.142
- Sarah is gonna show
me where the drinks are,

01:16:55.144 --> 01:16:56.277
you want one?

01:16:56.279 --> 01:16:57.612
- Yeah, get me one.

01:16:57.614 --> 01:16:59.313
- I'll be right back.

01:17:10.225 --> 01:17:10.224
- so you're really from here?

01:17:10.226 --> 01:17:13.160
- Yeah, born and raised.

01:17:13.162 --> 01:17:14.662
- Wow, I don't think I've ever

01:17:14.664 --> 01:17:17.231
actually met someone from la?

01:17:17.233 --> 01:17:17.231
- My dad grew up a
couple houses down,

01:17:17.233 --> 01:17:21.769
that's actually why
I was walking by.

01:17:21.771 --> 01:17:23.170
- Thanks for the beer, miles.

01:17:23.172 --> 01:17:24.872
- Becca, ah fuck, sorry.

01:17:24.874 --> 01:17:24.872
- It's okay.

01:17:24.874 --> 01:17:27.041
- Oh, I'll go grab you one.

01:17:27.043 --> 01:17:28.275
- Oh, thanks.

01:17:31.279 --> 01:17:32.313
What a day.

01:17:38.654 --> 01:17:42.323
- How do you know if you
actually know someone?

01:17:42.325 --> 01:17:45.326
- Um, I think you
just kinda know.

01:17:47.429 --> 01:17:49.230
- Isn't it kinda like terrifying

01:17:49.232 --> 01:17:51.198
to think that, you
know, that you think

01:17:51.200 --> 01:17:54.368
you might know someone
but you really don't?

01:17:54.370 --> 01:17:56.971
- What if we come
up with a test?

01:17:56.973 --> 01:17:58.172
- Is that possible?

01:17:58.174 --> 01:17:58.172
- So you'll know,
like foolproof.

01:17:58.174 --> 01:18:00.808
- Is that possible, how?

01:18:00.810 --> 01:18:02.176
- Uh, okay, how about this?

01:18:02.178 --> 01:18:03.411
What color are my eyes?

01:18:03.413 --> 01:18:04.413
- Becca.

01:18:05.447 --> 01:18:07.114
- Miles, what color are my eyes?

01:18:07.116 --> 01:18:09.684
- I'm like a dude, I don't
know my mom's eye color.

01:18:09.686 --> 01:18:13.220
- What, I saw you 15 years,
dude, what color are my eyes?

01:18:13.222 --> 01:18:14.855
- It's a trick question.

01:18:14.857 --> 01:18:15.856
- How so?

01:18:15.858 --> 01:18:20.828
- 'Cause your eyes change
color with the light.

01:18:23.865 --> 01:18:24.865
- Yeah.

01:18:24.867 --> 01:18:27.034
- My god, I was
worried for a second.

01:18:27.036 --> 01:18:27.034
- Why?

01:18:27.036 --> 01:18:29.970
- Maybe your eyes didn't
change color with the light?

01:18:33.942 --> 01:18:37.812
- Night's like tonight make
me feel happy to be alive.

01:18:37.814 --> 01:18:39.980
Like, if we could just
look out into the stars

01:18:39.982 --> 01:18:42.116
and as the smoke clears
and we see everything

01:18:42.118 --> 01:18:43.384
that's going on.

01:18:43.386 --> 01:18:46.754
- Taco Tuesday, roll out!

01:18:46.756 --> 01:18:47.888
- Oh yeah.

01:18:47.890 --> 01:18:49.123
- What is that?

01:18:49.125 --> 01:18:50.257
- We night bike around la.

01:18:50.259 --> 01:18:52.026
It gets kinda crazy.

01:18:52.028 --> 01:18:52.026
- Oh, that sounds fun.

01:18:52.028 --> 01:18:56.864
- I gotta couple bikes
if you guys wanna join.

01:18:56.866 --> 01:18:58.132
- Yeah.

01:20:31.493 --> 01:20:33.260
- I'm dead.

01:20:36.865 --> 01:20:41.135
- Oh, my legs are like,
what the hell are you doing?

01:20:46.575 --> 01:20:51.045
All of la's light poles, all
in one place, just for you.

01:20:52.380 --> 01:20:53.514
- Thank you.

01:20:55.617 --> 01:20:57.484
- I woke up this
morning, I had no idea

01:20:57.486 --> 01:20:58.986
today would be like this.

01:20:58.988 --> 01:21:00.387
- Me neither.

01:21:00.389 --> 01:21:01.322
- Honestly, I just
thought we were gonna bowl

01:21:01.324 --> 01:21:02.990
and play area 51.

01:21:03.859 --> 01:21:04.859
- Still time.

01:21:04.861 --> 01:21:05.960
- It's one.

01:21:06.895 --> 01:21:08.095
- Rain check.

01:21:12.434 --> 01:21:17.238
- Is life still on pause
or do we have to hit play?

01:21:17.240 --> 01:21:21.242
- I think we have a few
minutes left on pause.

01:21:22.210 --> 01:21:24.144
- I think you should
go to New York,

01:21:24.146 --> 01:21:26.280
it's dark in la.

01:21:26.282 --> 01:21:27.348
Just do it.

01:21:29.985 --> 01:21:30.651
- Really?

01:21:30.653 --> 01:21:32.319
- Yeah.

01:21:32.321 --> 01:21:33.187
- Really?

01:21:33.189 --> 01:21:34.189
- Yeah.

01:21:37.559 --> 01:21:38.559
- Yes!

01:21:49.537 --> 01:21:51.538
What are you gonna do?

01:21:54.142 --> 01:21:55.676
- I'm gonna swing.

01:22:55.971 --> 01:22:58.105
- What are you gonna do?

01:22:59.107 --> 01:22:59.106
- I've got to get
together with Sam

01:22:59.108 --> 01:23:04.144
and just figure out if
there's anything still there.

01:23:04.146 --> 01:23:05.646
- What about the family meeting?

01:23:05.648 --> 01:23:08.582
- No pow-wow, I'm
calling my mom and saying

01:23:08.584 --> 01:23:13.053
this is about me and Sam,
it's nobody else's business.

01:23:14.122 --> 01:23:15.422
- Good for you.

01:23:18.593 --> 01:23:21.996
Hey, you're probably
gonna need this.

01:23:23.298 --> 01:23:24.999
- What is that?

01:23:25.001 --> 01:23:27.201
I saw you throw
that in the lake.

01:23:27.203 --> 01:23:29.069
- It was my compact.

01:23:29.671 --> 01:23:29.670
- I don't have a compact,

01:23:29.672 --> 01:23:33.107
I threw your phone in the lake.

01:23:33.109 --> 01:23:36.643
- I told you you were
gonna feel like shit.

01:23:36.645 --> 01:23:38.379
It's just a phone.

01:23:43.051 --> 01:23:45.019
Besides, at least
now you're even.

01:23:45.021 --> 01:23:46.687
- What's that supposed to mean?

01:23:46.689 --> 01:23:46.687
- Sam left a couple voicemails,

01:23:46.689 --> 01:23:50.424
she didn't have sex with
that guy, they just kissed.

01:23:50.426 --> 01:23:52.092
- You checked my voicemail?

01:23:52.094 --> 01:23:54.695
- At least you have your phone.

01:23:54.697 --> 01:23:56.430
Look, I'm not saying that
you should get back together,

01:23:56.432 --> 01:23:59.166
but, at least now you're even.

01:24:00.735 --> 01:24:03.303
- You really are something.

01:24:04.739 --> 01:24:06.106
- Well, if you're
ever in New York,

01:24:06.108 --> 01:24:07.641
you can always
crash on my couch.

01:24:07.643 --> 01:24:08.709
- Couch?

01:24:08.711 --> 01:24:10.711
- Yeah, buster, couch.

01:24:10.713 --> 01:24:11.812
- What makes you
think you're gonna

01:24:11.814 --> 01:24:13.080
have room for a couch?

01:24:14.305 --> 01:24:20.318
