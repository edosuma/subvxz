SOME MAGIC CLUE *

00:26.160 --> 00:30.398
* INSIDE THESE GENTLE WALLS *

00:30.464 --> 00:33.734

WHOA. HUNK ALERT.

01:33.026 --> 01:34.928
THAT'S STEVE WEBSTER.

01:34.995 --> 01:36.096
YOU KNOW HIM?

01:36.164 --> 01:38.932
YOU'VE ACTUALLY SEEN
THOSE LIPS MOVE?

01:38.999 --> 01:42.136
STEVE'S MY LOAN OFFICER
AT THE BANK.

01:42.203 --> 01:45.206
HE MADE ALL THIS POSSIBLE,
SO TREAT HIM KINDLY.

01:46.974 --> 01:47.608
HI.

01:47.675 --> 01:48.676
HELLO, RACHEL.

01:48.742 --> 01:52.480
CONGRATULATIONS.
THE PLACE, IT LOOKS GREAT.

01:52.546 --> 01:53.847
THANK YOU.

01:53.914 --> 01:55.649
WHO'S THIS
LOVELY YOUNG LADY?

01:55.716 --> 01:57.084
THIS IS MY NIECE LAURA.

01:57.151 --> 01:59.653
LAURA, THIS IS
STEVE WEBSTER.

01:59.720 --> 02:00.988
NICE TO MEET YOU.

02:01.054 --> 02:02.890
IT SURE IS.

02:04.858 --> 02:06.660
THESE ARE FOR YOU.

02:06.727 --> 02:09.197
OH, THANK YOU.

02:09.263 --> 02:10.898
OH, STEVE,
THEY'RE BEAUTIFUL.

02:10.964 --> 02:13.767
COMPARED TO YOU,
THEY'RE JUST
A BUNCH OF WEEDS.

02:15.303 --> 02:16.904
WHAT A NICE THING
TO SAY.

02:16.970 --> 02:20.308
LAURA, WOULD YOU PUT THESE
IN SOME WEED WATER?

02:21.775 --> 02:22.743
SURE.

02:26.614 --> 02:28.649
I DID THAT
ON PURPOSE.

02:33.954 --> 02:37.525
IT WAS REALLY SWEET
OF YOU TO COME BY
LIKE THIS.

02:37.591 --> 02:39.427
DO LOAN OFFICERS
ALWAYS VISIT

02:39.493 --> 02:40.961
THE BUSINESSES
THEY FINANCE?

02:41.028 --> 02:45.199
I JUST DIDN'T
HAVE THE GUTS
TO SAY THIS BY PHONE.

02:45.266 --> 02:46.767
TELL ME WHAT?

02:46.834 --> 02:50.604
YOU DIDN'T READ
THE FINE PRINT
IN THE LOAN PAPERS.

02:50.671 --> 02:52.072
FINE PRINT?

02:52.139 --> 02:53.140
MM-HMM.

02:53.207 --> 02:55.008
THIS IS SO TYPICAL.

02:55.075 --> 02:57.311
YOU BANK PEOPLE
ARE REAL PIRANHAS.

02:57.378 --> 02:59.880
DOES MY INTEREST
RATE DOUBLE AFTER
THE FIRST YEAR?

02:59.947 --> 03:01.382
RELAX, RELAX.

03:01.449 --> 03:03.917
THE CLAUSE I'M
REFERRING TO STATES,

03:03.984 --> 03:07.621
"THE BORROWER IS REQUIRED,
WITHIN ONE WEEK
OF THE GRAND OPENING,

03:07.688 --> 03:11.559
TO HAVE DINNER
WITH THE LOAN OFFICER
OF SAID DOCUMENT."

03:13.327 --> 03:15.996
WELL, NOW,
THAT IS FINE PRINT.

03:16.063 --> 03:18.031
VERY FINE PRINT.

03:18.098 --> 03:21.302
HOW ABOUT FRIDAY
AT 8:00?

03:21.369 --> 03:23.337
LOOK, STEVE,
I BARELY KNOW YOU.

03:23.404 --> 03:25.205
BESIDES, I'M NOT SURE
IT'S GOOD

03:25.273 --> 03:27.641
TO MIX BUSINESS
WITH PLEASURE.

03:29.209 --> 03:30.944
I SEE.

03:32.813 --> 03:34.648
7:30 WOULD BE BETTER.

03:34.715 --> 03:36.550
GREAT!

03:37.851 --> 03:39.720
UNTIL FRIDAY.

03:48.629 --> 03:49.697
HARRIET, HARRIET.
RICHIE'S GONE.

03:49.763 --> 03:51.198
I CAN'T FIND MY SON ANYWHERE.

03:51.265 --> 03:52.633
RACHEL--

03:52.700 --> 03:55.135
HE'S NOT UPSTAIRS OR DOWNSTAIRS.
NOT INSIDE OR OUTSIDE.

03:55.202 --> 03:56.036
SO CALL THE POLICE.

03:56.103 --> 03:57.971
RACHEL!
WHAT?

03:58.038 --> 04:00.941
PEEK-A-BOO!

04:01.008 --> 04:04.712
OH, I DIDN'T KNOW WHERE
YOU WERE. MOMMY WAS WORRIED

04:04.778 --> 04:07.014
LITTLE RICHIE AND I WERE JUST
READING THE PAPER TOGETHER.

04:08.749 --> 04:11.819
RACHEL, I'M GOING TO GET YOU
AN INTERCOM SYSTEM.

04:11.885 --> 04:14.955
YOU CAN KEEP AN EAR ON HIM
NO MATTER WHERE HE IS.

04:15.022 --> 04:19.393
THANKS, HARRIET. AND WHEN STEVE
GETS HERE ENTERTAIN HIM.

04:19.460 --> 04:21.962
OKAY, BABY.

04:25.399 --> 04:28.001
CAN'T WE WATCH
A SESAME STREET TAPE?

04:28.068 --> 04:31.839
I DON'T THINK SO, SWEETHEART,
YOU'RE UNCLE CARL WORE IT OUT.

04:52.826 --> 04:55.162
I-I'M COLD.

04:55.228 --> 04:57.130
STEVE, WHAT'S WRONG?

04:57.197 --> 04:58.532
I...

04:58.599 --> 05:02.202
O-O-ORGANIZED
TH-THE F-F-FREEZER.

05:02.269 --> 05:03.604
OH, YOU POOR BABY.

05:03.671 --> 05:05.539
HOW LONG WERE YOU
IN THERE?

05:05.606 --> 05:09.009
L-L-LONG ENOUGH
TO GET ICICLES
ON MY NOSE HAIR.

05:09.076 --> 05:10.544
LOOK.

05:11.512 --> 05:14.247
I'LL JUST TAKE YOUR WORD
FOR IT.

05:14.314 --> 05:16.216
STEVE, THANK YOU
SO MUCH

05:16.283 --> 05:17.351
FOR ORGANIZING
THE FREEZER.

05:17.418 --> 05:20.020
THAT WAS
VERY ENTERPRISING.

05:20.087 --> 05:21.054
YOU KNOW WHAT?

05:21.121 --> 05:23.824
YOU ARE A VERY
SPECIAL PERSON.

05:23.891 --> 05:26.660
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
I'D DO WITHOUT YOU.

05:33.266 --> 05:34.968
HELLO, EDDO.

05:36.404 --> 05:38.972
EDDIE WINSLOW,
YOU ARE A SLIME BUCKET.

05:39.039 --> 05:40.441
SO LONG, EDDO.

05:42.876 --> 05:43.911
JOLENE!

05:43.977 --> 05:47.180
IS IT TRUE
YOU ASKED OUT
SIMONE EDWARDS?

05:47.247 --> 05:49.116
WHAT?

05:49.182 --> 05:51.985
YOU'RE THE ONLY GIRL
FOR ME.

05:52.986 --> 05:55.188
DID YOU ASK HER OUT
OR NOT?

05:55.255 --> 05:57.458
WELL, YEAH.

05:59.259 --> 06:01.662
THE GOOD NEWS IS
SHE SAID NO.

06:01.729 --> 06:05.399
THAT'S IT.
WE'RE THOUGH,
EDDIE--HISTORY.

06:07.935 --> 06:10.003
HOO HOO HOO!

06:12.706 --> 06:15.042
UH, EDDIE, IS THIS
A BAD TIME?

06:15.108 --> 06:18.078
STEVE,
I JUST GOT DUMPED.

06:18.145 --> 06:20.881
OH, GOOD.
THEN YOU'RE FREE.

06:22.650 --> 06:25.218
I NEED YOUR OPINION
ON SOMETHING, EDDIE.

06:25.285 --> 06:26.420
I'M STARTING
TO SEE SIGNS

06:26.487 --> 06:29.490
THAT A CERTAIN GIRL
LIKES ME.

06:29.557 --> 06:31.925
WHAT KIND OF SIGNS?

06:31.992 --> 06:33.561
WELL, FOR ONE THING,

06:33.627 --> 06:36.497
SHE'S ALWAYS
COMPLIMENTING ME.

06:36.564 --> 06:39.332
COMPLIMENTING IS GOOD.

06:39.399 --> 06:42.002
OH. SHE TOUCHES ME
A LOT.

06:42.069 --> 06:43.270
SHE--YEAH, YEAH.

06:43.336 --> 06:44.271
HUGGING...

06:44.337 --> 06:46.073
PATTING...

06:46.139 --> 06:48.842
OOH--AND RUBBING.

06:50.343 --> 06:52.646
RUBBING IS REAL GOOD.

06:52.713 --> 06:54.848
IT MIGHT BE
MY IMAGINATION.

06:54.915 --> 06:58.051
THE CONCEPT OF A GIRL
ACTUALLY ENJOYING
MY PRESENCE

06:58.118 --> 07:01.021
IS ALL BRAND-NEW TO ME.

07:01.088 --> 07:04.658
ARE THERE ANY OTHER
SIGNS TO LOOK OUT FOR?

07:04.725 --> 07:06.960
WELL, I CAN TELL YOU
HOW I FOUND OUT

07:07.027 --> 07:10.864
THAT JOLENE HAD FALLEN
FOR THE EDSTER.

07:10.931 --> 07:12.800
WHO?

07:12.866 --> 07:14.935
ME.

07:15.002 --> 07:16.604
OH. PLEASE, GO ON.

07:16.670 --> 07:19.907
ONE DAY I HAD
WALKED BY HER
IN STUDY HALL.

07:19.973 --> 07:23.844
SHE WAS DOODLING MY NAME
OVER AND OVER.

07:23.911 --> 07:25.212
WOW!

07:26.880 --> 07:31.084
THANKS, PAL. IF YOU
EVER NEED ANYTHING,
JUST SAY THE WORD.

07:31.151 --> 07:32.853
THANKS.
BRING ME A BURGER.

07:32.920 --> 07:35.956
SORRY. THIS ISN'T
MY STATION.

07:47.434 --> 07:49.703
"RACHEL LOVES STEVE."

07:59.513 --> 08:02.550
OKAY, LET'S SEE.

08:02.616 --> 08:05.118
BETTER ADD ZUCCHINI
TO THAT SHOPPING LIST.

08:08.288 --> 08:10.758
Z-U-K--

08:10.824 --> 08:12.359
NOPE.

08:12.425 --> 08:13.060
OH.

08:13.126 --> 08:16.296
Z-O-O-K--

08:16.363 --> 08:18.065
UH-UH.

08:18.799 --> 08:21.535
LET'S GET CORN INSTEAD.

08:25.005 --> 08:27.407
OKAY, RICHIE,

08:27.474 --> 08:29.376
THE INTERCOM IS ALL READY.

08:29.442 --> 08:31.244
HERE'S HOW IT WORKS.

08:31.311 --> 08:32.646
THE TRANSMITTER
STAYS HERE,

08:32.713 --> 08:34.447
AND THE RECEIVER GOES
IN THE LIVING ROOM.

08:34.514 --> 08:37.350
IF YOU TALK HERE,
I CAN HEAR YOU THERE.

08:37.417 --> 08:38.652
BUT HOW?

08:38.719 --> 08:42.389
WELL, IF YOU--
THIS COMES--IF--

08:42.455 --> 08:44.625
LET'S JUST TRY IT OUT.

08:44.692 --> 08:47.027
OKAY.
YOU GO IN THERE,

08:47.094 --> 08:49.062
AND I'LL SAY HI.

08:49.129 --> 08:50.598
DEAL.

08:50.664 --> 08:52.833
HERE WE GO NOW.

08:56.303 --> 08:59.039
THIS IS SO MUCH FUN.

09:02.409 --> 09:03.611
SHH!

09:08.448 --> 09:09.482
[HIGH-PITCHED SCREAM]

09:09.549 --> 09:10.884
AAH!

09:20.227 --> 09:21.094
HEY, EVERYBODY.

09:21.161 --> 09:21.962
HI, RACHEL.

09:22.029 --> 09:22.830
CAN WE TALK?

09:22.896 --> 09:24.131
WE'RE GOING TO THE STORE.

09:24.197 --> 09:27.067
IT'S ABOUT A MAN.

09:31.238 --> 09:34.174
JUDY, GO GET
THE DICTIONARY
AND LOOK UP ZUCCHINI.

09:34.241 --> 09:36.744
OH, I NEVER GET TO HEAR
THE GOOD STUFF.

09:40.981 --> 09:43.951
OKAY, YOU WANT TO TALK TO US
ABOUT A MAN?

09:44.017 --> 09:47.354
ANY CHANCE THIS MAN
COULD BE STEVE WEBSTER?

09:47.420 --> 09:48.989
YES!

09:49.056 --> 09:52.325
WELL, YOU KNOW WE HAD
DINNER THE OTHER NIGHT.

09:52.392 --> 09:54.327
WE HAD A GREAT TIME.

09:54.394 --> 09:56.496
WE GOT THE HINT
WHEN YOU WALKED
THROUGH THE DOOR

09:56.563 --> 09:59.466
AND DID A CARTWHEEL.

09:59.532 --> 10:02.703
WELL, YOU KNOW, STEVE
IS SMART, CHARMING,
AND FUNNY.

10:02.770 --> 10:05.973
AND HE ASKED ME OUT AGAIN.

10:06.039 --> 10:06.840
BUT...

10:06.907 --> 10:10.110
BUT HE'S A LITTLE...

10:10.177 --> 10:12.379
YOUNG.

10:12.445 --> 10:13.781
YOU KNOW HOW PEOPLE TALK

10:13.847 --> 10:16.850
WHEN A MATURE WOMAN
DATES A YOUNGER MAN.

10:16.917 --> 10:20.654
THE STORY OF MY LIFE.

10:20.721 --> 10:22.956
I FELT LIKE EVERYONE
WAS STARING AT US

10:23.023 --> 10:25.225
BECAUSE OF
OUR AGE DIFFERENCE.

10:25.292 --> 10:27.527
RACHEL,
YOU'RE ONLY 35.

10:27.594 --> 10:30.230
WELL...HE'S 28.

10:30.297 --> 10:31.899
HERE'S HOW I SEE IT.

10:31.965 --> 10:34.768
THERE'S
ONLY THREE THINGS
IMPORTANT IN A MAN--

10:34.835 --> 10:37.504
THAT HE'S SINGLE,
OVER 21,

10:37.570 --> 10:40.607
AND BRINGS
HIS OWN TOOTHBRUSH.

10:40.674 --> 10:43.711
OOH! YOU OUGHT TO QUIT!

10:43.777 --> 10:46.880
GEE, OFFICER, I'M REALLY
SORRY I WAS SPEEDING.

10:46.947 --> 10:48.916
DO WE HAVE TO GO
TO THE POLICE STATION?

10:48.982 --> 10:52.085
YEP. BUT FIRST YOU HAVE
TO STOP FOR DOUGHNUTS.

10:52.152 --> 10:53.721
YEAH!

10:53.787 --> 10:56.123
MY KIND OF COP.

10:58.759 --> 10:59.727
HI, BIG GUY.

10:59.793 --> 11:02.029
HI.
HI.

11:03.230 --> 11:06.166
CARL, I BROUGHT THE NOTES
TO GO OVER WITH LAURA.

11:06.233 --> 11:07.267
SHE'S IN THE SHOWER.

11:07.334 --> 11:09.737
THANKS.

11:10.738 --> 11:12.372
I ALMOST GOT YOU THERE.

11:12.439 --> 11:15.042
CUTE.
I'LL TELL HER.

11:15.108 --> 11:17.477
COME ON, RICHIE.
I NEED BACKUP.

11:17.544 --> 11:20.247
10-4!

11:23.450 --> 11:24.918
MAYBE YOU'RE RIGHT.

11:24.985 --> 11:27.620
I MEAN, THE AGE DIFFERENCE
DOESN'T REALLY MATTER.

11:27.687 --> 11:31.725
WHAT DOES MATTER
IS THE WAY STEVE
MAKES ME FEEL.

11:34.394 --> 11:37.030
I MEAN, STEVE
HAS CHANGED MY WHOLE LIFE.

11:37.097 --> 11:41.068
IF IT WEREN'T FOR HIM,
I WOULDN'T HAVE
RACHEL'S PLACE.

11:41.134 --> 11:44.805
AND THERE ARE SO MANY
WONDERFUL THINGS
ABOUT HIM.

11:44.872 --> 11:47.074
HE'S HANDSOME.

11:49.509 --> 11:52.079
HE'S A GREAT DRESSER.

11:53.613 --> 11:57.350
AND HE IS ONE
OF THE SEXIEST MEN
I'VE EVER MET.

12:01.254 --> 12:02.890
YOU REALLY LIKE HIM.

12:02.956 --> 12:05.092
LIKE HIM?
OH, HARRIETTE,

12:05.158 --> 12:08.896
I'M FALLING
HEAD-OVER-HEELS
IN LOVE WITH HIM.

12:20.941 --> 12:24.277
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M GOING TO INVITE STEVE

12:24.344 --> 12:28.181
TO A ROMANTIC DINNER
AT THE RESTAURANT
ON SUNDAY.

12:28.248 --> 12:29.416
CANDLELIGHT...

12:29.482 --> 12:31.985
THE TWO OF US ALL ALONE.

12:32.052 --> 12:33.854
WHOO...
WHOO...

12:33.921 --> 12:36.323
EEE!
EEE!

12:39.692 --> 12:41.394
OH, HI, STEVE.

12:41.461 --> 12:42.462
OH!

12:42.529 --> 12:43.463
HOW ARE YOU?

12:43.530 --> 12:44.764
I'M FINE!

12:46.466 --> 12:47.667
STEVE, WOULD YOU MIND

12:47.734 --> 12:50.703
COMING OVER
TO THE RESTAURANT
ON SUNDAY ABOUT 7:30?

12:50.770 --> 12:53.540
WHAT?
HUH, WH-WH-WH-WHAT?

12:53.606 --> 12:55.042
WELL, I'M
PLANNING A DINNER

WELL, YOU SEE,
I HAVE REASON TO BELIEVE

14:16.423 --> 14:20.227
THAT A CERTAIN WOMAN
IS FALLING IN LOVE WITH ME.

14:20.293 --> 14:23.663
WELL, WE CAN BE SURE
IT'S NOT LAURA.

14:23.730 --> 14:25.032

SHE'S BEEN THE ONLY
GIRL FOR ME SINCE
WE MET IN KINDERGARTEN

14:51.758 --> 14:53.893
AND SHE MADE ME
EAT MY PLAY-DOH.

14:55.795 --> 15:00.367
WELL, STEVE, MAYBE YOU
SHOULD GIVE THIS OTHER
GIRL A CHANCE.

15:00.433 --> 15:04.837
I MEAN, IT DOESN'T LOOK
LIKE LAURA'S GOING
TO FALL INTO YOUR ARMS

15:04.904 --> 15:07.707
ANY TIME THIS CENTURY.
