Yes.

00:53.762 --> 00:55.889
You know,
you wrote this song for her.

00:57.557 --> 00:58.850
You sure.

00:59.559 --> 01:02.645
There is something romantic.

01:05.397 --> 01:07.150
You sure.

01:08.276 --> 01:11.738
"Baby, I wrote this song
if fucking"

01:15.950 --> 01:18.495
Because you've never played that for me.

01:20.413 --> 01:22.290
I had not finished bunny.

01:22.791 --> 01:24.667
Wanted it to be super good.

01:25.001 --> 01:26.086
- Did you like?
- Si.

01:27.253 --> 01:28.213
- Yes?
- Si.

- Si.

01:36.513 --> 01:37.305

01:37.347 --> 01:38.306
Where did you get that?

01:40.558 --> 01:42.519
I do not know, I think I
found in the grass.

01:43.269 --> 01:46.314
We're leaving.

01:50.500 --> 01:51.400
Yes.

02:29.774 --> 02:31.109
Yes.

02:36.698 --> 02:39.033
Bunny, honey, where are you?

02:50.420 --> 02:52.213
Yes.

02:53.882 --> 02:56.885
My God. Sweetie

03:04.392 --> 03:07.145
Baby, you're so bad.

03:07.146 --> 03:08.479
I know.

03:33.171 --> 03:35.048
God.

03:38.927 --> 03:42.555
No, no, God.

03:58.196 --> 04:00.490
Thou soul stays with me.

04:18.091 --> 04:21.094
FIELDS OF THE DEAD

05:31.122 --> 05:33.791
fucking hate  Lions.

05:34.625 --> 05:36.085
This is a shock.

05:36.627 --> 05:40.757
Trent
could not have found a research site.

05:41.424 --> 05:43.676
Yeah, where is that is this place?

05:44.010 --> 05:47.096
Is an abandoned farm that
university purchased 10 years ago.

05:47.722 --> 05:49.057
In fact, they got it very cheap.

05:49.474 --> 05:50.391
- Yes? .
- Yes

05:50.433 --> 05:52.268
Well, probably
there is a reason for that.

05:53.853 --> 05:59.400
Was it the killer boyfriend, a slaughter of Indians
,

05:59.442 --> 06:00.193
not forget the fucking death cult.

06:00.234 --> 06:02.945
Someone must have spent some time on the Internet
last night.

06:03.529 --> 06:06.657
Yeah, well I had time to look
things more interesting than that.

06:07.367 --> 06:08.910
What, boobs and vaginas?

06:09.285 --> 06:10.536
In the account. All right.

06:10.870 --> 06:12.163
Hey guys, need to start behaving
.

06:12.497 --> 06:13.831
You were the ones who pointed
for research.

06:14.207 --> 06:15.666
Yes
because it is mandatory for graduation.

06:16.125 --> 06:17.835
Coercion?

06:18.711 --> 06:21.130
And you who are, pre-lawyer?

06:21.422 --> 06:23.883
Yeah, well mom fawning
playing for you, Trent.

06:24.550 --> 06:26.010
- All right.
- Burned.

06:26.011 --> 06:27.387
Look, going to be a difficult journey know.

06:27.804 --> 06:29.013
But we can also have fun.

06:29.430 --> 06:32.141
We do our research,
our work during the day...

06:32.600 --> 06:33.768
and had a fun night.

06:34.143 --> 06:35.895
Do not let it bother you,
affection. It will be a good week.

06:36.312 --> 06:37.397
Thank you.

06:37.939 --> 06:39.857
The best week!

06:55.790 --> 06:56.791
Thank you.

06:57.291 --> 06:58.292
God, this weighs.

06:59.335 --> 07:00.837
That's a gay bag.

07:03.965 --> 07:05.007
Thank you.

07:10.638 --> 07:12.140
Well, my bag.

07:16.436 --> 07:17.603
Ashley!

07:21.357 --> 07:23.609
Cheryl, are you ready for the filets
store?

07:24.360 --> 07:26.279
Here. Thank you.

07:26.737 --> 07:27.905
Want to help me with this please?

07:28.614 --> 07:31.701
Thanks for the help, these things always get
problems.

07:32.493 --> 07:33.661
No problem.

07:34.120 --> 07:36.372
Also, this should come
my share of the rent.

07:36.873 --> 07:39.000
I'm sorry, your rent?

07:39.584 --> 07:40.960
Yes, roommate.

07:41.419 --> 07:43.754
I do not think so.

07:44.672 --> 07:47.717
Moreover, do not you want a room with Ashley
?

07:49.218 --> 07:53.139
Ashley is not the kind of woman he wanted
to cohabit.

07:58.352 --> 08:00.605
Would you want a room with Ashley?

08:01.063 --> 08:02.607
No, decidedly not.

08:03.024 --> 08:04.692
Well, I think that settles it.

08:05.109 --> 08:07.528
Actually
Linda and I share the store.

08:08.488 --> 08:10.573
Well, that is fine,
I do not mind sharing.

08:13.743 --> 08:15.786
- Shop, Cheryl.
- Si.

08:16.162 --> 08:17.580
God, do not imagine things.

08:18.206 --> 08:20.374
's Actually quite logical when you think about it.

08:21.042 --> 08:24.253
I mean, Trent and
Randy, obviously. Linda and me.

08:25.338 --> 08:26.255
Obvious.

08:27.131 --> 08:28.174
Josh and you.

08:28.175 --> 08:29.217
Course.

08:29.884 --> 08:32.345
Ashley
has his own shop so... we are complete.

08:34.472 --> 08:37.850
Yes, I guess that covers it.

08:38.799 --> 08:39.970
Yes.

08:41.812 --> 08:43.856
So much so, no!

08:53.533 --> 08:56.202
I have three days to take her to bed.

08:58.704 --> 09:01.207
Hey, knucklehead,
what the fuck do I do with this?

09:02.708 --> 09:04.919
Sit up.

09:05.461 --> 09:07.880
Is not funny.

09:08.381 --> 09:11.050
All this corn was infected by this disease
earlier this year.

09:11.467 --> 09:13.177
Yes, you can see there.

09:13.928 --> 09:17.473
Let the barn. Gather and prepare all
,

09:17.765 --> 09:18.641
we go early in the morning.

09:18.975 --> 09:20.476
Early?

09:20.726 --> 09:22.019
Very early.

09:22.979 --> 09:24.522
Remember, I'm useless before seven.

09:25.189 --> 09:28.359
Useless opposed to... porcelain.

09:28.360 --> 09:29.944
Hey, no shower.

09:32.321 --> 09:33.781
No shower out here.

09:33.915 --> 09:37.159
All right. Well, I have to shower
at least once daily.

09:37.660 --> 09:39.412
Seriously, we're one week.

09:39.787 --> 09:41.539
I know,
a week without a shower, that's disgusting.

09:42.039 --> 09:44.417
We are there.

09:46.127 --> 09:47.962
It's okay. Good luck with that.

09:50.840 --> 09:53.175
Go find a shower. All right.

10:06.439 --> 10:10.067
So
I'm not interrupting anything here, right?

10:10.943 --> 10:12.320
No.

10:13.279 --> 10:15.865
is a little cloudy in here, yes?

10:17.617 --> 10:21.996
I care little, but do not let Trent
see this.

10:22.330 --> 10:25.791
I say, he acts quite great,
trying to be okay with you ..

10:27.084 --> 10:28.628
But this is her thesis project.

10:29.170 --> 10:30.713
Yes this is fucked
is capable of killing someone.

10:34.717 --> 10:36.344
So what touches me something?

10:51.942 --> 10:54.070
That's disgusting.

10:54.654 --> 10:56.155
It's not so bad.

10:57.531 --> 10:59.742
What am I going to do?
I have to be clean.

11:00.660 --> 11:02.078
You know, I ha
