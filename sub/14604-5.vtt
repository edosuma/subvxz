00:07.728 --> 00:08.861
Can I help you?

00:08.895 --> 00:10.129
Hi, sir.
I'm Dorrit's boyfriend.

00:10.163 --> 00:11.630
What the hell is going on?
If I didn't meet your dad,

00:11.665 --> 00:12.932
he'd never let you
out of the house again.

00:12.966 --> 00:15.367
That wasn't your call.
It was mine.

00:15.402 --> 00:16.869
You pretend to be above
the idea of commitment,

00:16.903 --> 00:19.472
but the truth is,
you're just afraid to connect.

00:19.506 --> 00:20.906
I'm not afraid of commitment.

00:20.941 --> 00:22.741
I'm sure the girls at
your school are all over you.

00:22.776 --> 00:24.243
Not the one that matters.

00:24.277 --> 00:25.611
How about you,
my budding literary lion?

00:25.645 --> 00:27.012
How's the pitch coming?

00:27.047 --> 00:28.781
Well, I think I've finally
narrowed it down to Adam Weaver.

00:28.815 --> 00:29.982
The young playwright
I've been reading about

00:30.016 --> 00:31.250
in Arts & Leisure?

00:31.284 --> 00:32.918
Some of us are headed
to McSorley's to grab a drink.

00:32.953 --> 00:35.387
You wanna come?
Yeah, I'd love to.

00:35.422 --> 00:37.656
You get me a juicy interview,
and I will publish it.

00:37.691 --> 00:40.192
- This is definitely off the record.
- Definitely.

00:58.111 --> 01:00.479
Yes, I-I wanna be

01:00.513 --> 01:03.115
Uh, but not the objective,
detached kind. Mm-hmm.

01:03.149 --> 01:04.449
I wanna use my own voice.

01:04.483 --> 01:06.585
You know, let people know
I've been there and seen it.

01:06.619 --> 01:08.353
Ah. You're a Gonzo.

01:08.388 --> 01:09.955
- Gonzo?
- Hunter Thompson.

01:09.989 --> 01:11.156
Gonzo journalism.

01:11.190 --> 01:13.191

with Gonzo the Great...

01:13.226 --> 01:15.460

Mm-hmm.

01:18.464 --> 01:20.629
In love with, uh...

01:20.749 --> 01:22.183
Camilla the chicken.

01:22.217 --> 01:23.284
Yes.

01:23.318 --> 01:25.253
But anyway,
back to Hunter Thompson.

01:25.287 --> 01:26.654
- Right.
- You're out of cups.

01:26.688 --> 01:28.156
And this wine is cheaper
than my press-on nails.

01:28.190 --> 01:29.357

01:44.406 --> 01:45.773
Wow. She is a character.

01:45.807 --> 01:47.275
Oh, she sure is.

01:47.309 --> 01:49.677
You know, all these... all these

01:54.016 --> 01:55.149
Mm-hmm.

01:55.183 --> 01:56.384
That's, like, his uniform.

01:56.418 --> 01:59.520
He inspired my short play
"The Fishy Detective."

01:59.554 --> 02:01.388
Oh!

02:01.423 --> 02:02.490
- Right?

It's not a little diary!

02:39.427 --> 02:41.562
It's a sophisticated journal.

02:41.596 --> 02:42.729
And just for the record,

02:42.764 --> 02:44.164
there are plenty
of heavyweight writers

02:45.733 --> 02:47.568
Virginia Woolf, Joan Didion...

02:47.602 --> 02:50.237
Franz Kafka. I know.
 I know.

02:50.271 --> 02:52.506
My favorite cockroach owes
his existential existence

02:52.540 --> 02:53.674
to a journal.

02:53.708 --> 02:55.442
I tried a typewriter.

02:55.476 --> 02:58.011
I just wanna be able to write
whenever the mood strikes,

02:58.046 --> 03:00.047
so I just carry my journal
everywhere.

03:00.081 --> 03:01.515
Ugh. I'm jealous.

03:01.549 --> 03:03.283
I haven't seen daylight
in weeks

03:03.317 --> 03:06.086
because I'm chained to
my typewriter.

03:06.120 --> 03:07.921
At least it's...
it's paying off.

03:07.955 --> 03:10.724
I just finished the first act
of my play.

03:10.758 --> 03:11.892
You did?

03:11.926 --> 03:13.393
- Mm-hmm.
- That's amazing.

03:13.427 --> 03:15.395
- Can I read it?
- Oh, no way.

03:16.664 --> 03:17.998
It's not personal.

03:18.032 --> 03:20.700
No, I never let anyone read
my work until it's finished.

03:20.735 --> 03:23.603
Writing is... is a-a sacred thing.
Private.

03:23.638 --> 03:25.171
I totally respect that.

03:25.206 --> 03:26.973
I would never let anyone read
my journal.

03:27.008 --> 03:29.809
It's just...
It's way too intimate.

03:29.844 --> 03:32.078
See, and I love
dating a writer, too.

03:32.113 --> 03:33.380
You get me.

03:33.414 --> 03:35.515
You think of me as a writer?

03:36.817 --> 03:39.686
I love that.

03:39.720 --> 03:42.288
So can you at least tell me what
your new play is about?

03:42.323 --> 03:43.456
Of course.

03:43.491 --> 03:44.991
My ex-girlfriend Katja.

03:45.025 --> 03:47.327
Who cares? It's not
like he's sleeping with her.

03:47.361 --> 03:49.295
It's like we're both sleeping
with her.

03:49.330 --> 03:51.631
Like she's right there
in the room with us.

03:51.665 --> 03:53.500
I knew a Katja once.
She was hot.

03:53.534 --> 03:54.868
Not helping.

03:54.902 --> 03:56.569
I thought listening to
the clacking of his typewriter

03:56.604 --> 03:58.705
as I fell asleep was romantic.

03:58.739 --> 04:01.140
Little did I know
those clacks were conjuring up

04:01.175 --> 04:03.910
some tall, hot vixen named
<i>Katja.</i>

04:03.944 --> 04:05.578
Sounds like a three-way
without the fun.

04:05.613 --> 04:08.181
If your man brings a bombshell
into the bedroom named Katja,

04:08.215 --> 04:09.782
you might as well get
some good sex out of it.

04:09.817 --> 04:11.751
Thankfully,
we haven't had sex yet.

04:11.785 --> 04:13.152
What?

04:13.187 --> 04:14.721
You and Weaver still haven't
had sex?

04:14.755 --> 04:16.189
Well, pretty much as close to it
as you can get.

04:16.223 --> 04:18.324
What are you waiting for?
A rich arab?

04:18.358 --> 04:21.094
Never fake your virginity
with an arab, by the way.

04:21.128 --> 04:24.130
They have ways
to suss it out of you.

04:24.164 --> 04:25.431
It was dreadful.

04:25.466 --> 04:28.034
I was thinking of faking
the opposite with Weaver...

04:28.068 --> 04:30.670
Pretending I'm not a virgin.

04:30.704 --> 04:32.171
You haven't
told him you're a virgin?

04:32.206 --> 04:33.873
No, and I don't plan on it.

04:33.907 --> 04:36.108
I made such a big deal out of it
with Sebastian.

04:36.143 --> 04:38.311
I mean, it was just a mess.

04:38.345 --> 04:40.446
I don't want
my lingering virginity

04:40.480 --> 04:42.581
to put pressure on
my relationship with Weaver.

04:42.616 --> 04:43.916
So if you have sex with Weaver,

04:43.950 --> 04:45.951
how do you plan on faking
your non-virginity?

04:45.986 --> 04:49.121
Well, I figure pain and pleasure
sound sort of the same.

04:49.156 --> 04:51.190
Grunting is grunting.
Just don't scream "Ow."

04:51.224 --> 04:53.859
Anyway, I'm not even sure I want
to have sex with someone

04:53.894 --> 04:56.262
who's still intimately involved
with his ex.

04:56.296 --> 04:58.697
I mean, even if it is
just in his imagination.

04:58.732 --> 04:59.865
When you're in
a new relationship,

04:59.900 --> 05:01.400
you have to mentally
and physically

05:01.434 --> 05:02.568
cut all ties with exes.

05:02.602 --> 05:05.170
I don't know.
I mean, maybe in some cases,

05:05.205 --> 05:07.873
it is possible to be friends
with an ex?

05:07.908 --> 05:09.308
Like you and Sebastian?

05:09.342 --> 05:11.277
No, not like me and Sebastian.

05:11.311 --> 05:14.046
We are the opposite case.

05:14.080 --> 05:17.249
There's just too much pain
and wreckage between us.

05:17.284 --> 05:19.918
We're respectful, yet distant.

05:19.953 --> 05:21.687
Like when we pass
in the hallways,

05:21.721 --> 05:24.757
we just keep our heads down,
nod ever so slightly,

05:24.791 --> 05:26.191
and keep walking.

05:26.226 --> 05:27.793
I remember how awkward it was
in high school

05:27.827 --> 05:29.428
when you run into an ex.
I had to quit Spanish

05:29.462 --> 05:33.065
after sleeping with Señor Gomez,
and English and history.

05:33.099 --> 05:34.533
High school was just full
of opportunities.

05:34.567 --> 05:35.701
Yes, it is.

05:35.735 --> 05:37.336
But not to sleep
with the faculty...

05:37.370 --> 05:38.670
To prove yourself.

05:38.705 --> 05:41.673
That is why I am president
of the Homecoming Committee.

05:41.708 --> 05:43.408
It's not my thing,
but I will put up with

05:43.443 --> 05:45.811
a bunch of idiot cheerleaders
with pom-poms

05:45.845 --> 05:47.846
to beef up with college apps.

05:47.880 --> 05:49.281
All this talk of pom-poms
reminds me

05:49.315 --> 05:52.117
I have to go display mine
at my new job.

05:53.319 --> 05:55.954
There's nothing like
getting paid to be naked.

05:55.989 --> 05:57.289
See you later, girls.

05:57.323 --> 05:58.757
Bye.
See you.

06:01.260 --> 06:02.761
Do you think
she's a call girl?

06:02.795 --> 06:03.929
Stripper.

06:03.963 --> 06:05.297
Yeah.

06:05.331 --> 06:07.599
<i>Most people find being naked</i>
<i>in front of others</i>

06:07.633 --> 06:10.101
<i>to be an intimate act.</i>

06:10.136 --> 06:11.570
<i>Some, like, Samantha,</i>
<i>find being naked</i>

06:11.604 --> 06:14.139
<i>as matter of fact as</i>
<i>shaking hands.</i>

06:14.173 --> 06:16.374
Since you took over
as the artist model,

06:16.409 --> 06:18.577
enrollment in my class
has tripled.

06:18.611 --> 06:20.779
The arts student league
is suddenly the place to be.

06:20.813 --> 06:23.315
Honey, this is nothing.
Once word of mouth hits,

06:23.349 --> 06:24.683
you'll have to rent
grand central station

06:24.717 --> 06:26.584
to fit all the artists who want.

06:30.990 --> 06:34.216
<i>While nothing was too intimate</i>
<i>for Samantha,</i>

06:34.336 --> 06:37.986
Sebastian was feeling uncomfortably
close to his mom.

06:38.464 --> 06:40.432
So what's this about, Ma?

06:42.101 --> 06:44.803
Can't I just have lunch
with my handsome son?

06:44.837 --> 06:47.438
This isn't something
we ever do.

06:47.473 --> 06:48.606
And you hate
coming to this house,

06:48.641 --> 06:50.375
so I'm pretty sure
there's a point to it.

06:51.844 --> 06:54.512
I do have some wonderful news
I want to share with you.

06:54.546 --> 06:58.182
Lucas and I are
getting married.

06:58.217 --> 07:00.918
Married?

07:00.953 --> 07:02.920
To the tennis instructor?

07:02.955 --> 07:04.455
Mm. Look at my ring.

07:04.490 --> 07:06.424
He picked it out himself.

07:06.458 --> 07:08.760
Did he pay for it himself?

07:08.794 --> 07:10.161
Now that's just cruel.

07:10.195 --> 07:13.164
Don't do that.
It doesn't suit you.

07:13.198 --> 07:15.533
I just...
I worry about you, mom.

07:15.567 --> 07:17.201
Mm. You shouldn't.

07:17.236 --> 07:19.804
Lucas makes me so happy.

07:19.838 --> 07:22.707
We have so many
common interests.

07:22.741 --> 07:25.343
We travel.
We work out together.

07:25.377 --> 07:26.644
He's 24.

07:26.678 --> 07:29.146
Age doesn't matter.

07:29.181 --> 07:30.948
Don't you want me to be happy?

07:30.983 --> 07:32.683
Yeah, of course I do, but...

07:32.718 --> 07:34.218
No "Buts".

07:34.253 --> 07:35.720
If you love me,

07:35.754 --> 07:39.023
you'll want to celebrate
my marriage to Lucas.

07:39.057 --> 07:40.291
A toast?

07:45.831 --> 07:48.332
Doesn't Mr. Byrne look like
the monster Grendel?

07:48.366 --> 07:50.234
Totally.
He looks like a troll.

07:50.268 --> 07:51.836
Who looks like a troll?

07:51.870 --> 07:53.838
Miller.
What are you doing here?

07:53.872 --> 07:55.506
I just wanted to see
my girlfriend,

07:55.540 --> 07:57.975
and I couldn't wait
till 4:00.

07:58.009 --> 07:59.543
See you in class, Dorrit.

07:59.578 --> 08:00.845
See ya.

08:02.113 --> 08:03.113
Who was that?

08:03.148 --> 08:05.783
I don't like him.
He was checking you out.

08:05.817 --> 08:07.017
Gabe Levitt?

08:07.052 --> 08:09.587
Are you kidding?
He's a geek from my trig class.

08:09.621 --> 08:11.388
You don't know guys, Dorrit.

08:11.423 --> 08:12.656
You need to stay away from him.

08:12.691 --> 08:14.058
The next time
he gives me his notes

08:14.092 --> 08:16.060
on the Law of Cosines,
I'll be sure to say "No."

08:16.094 --> 08:18.228
He offers you
his notes.

08:18.263 --> 08:19.830
He's totally hitting on you.

08:19.864 --> 08:21.165
Please do not tell me

08:21.199 --> 08:22.933
you came here to talk about
some nerd in my math class.

08:22.967 --> 08:24.168
So you know how

08:24.202 --> 08:26.703
my whole house is a dust pit
covered in plastic?

08:26.738 --> 08:28.105
My 'rents decided to bail,

08:28.139 --> 08:29.773
so I have the whole place
to myself.

08:29.808 --> 08:31.108
Okay.

08:31.142 --> 08:32.842
You can stay the whole week.

08:32.876 --> 08:35.445
I can't sleep out
on a school night.

08:35.480 --> 08:36.613
Just say you have, like,

08:36.648 --> 08:38.582
a project with Audrey
you have to finish.

08:38.616 --> 08:40.918
So we can hang around
in a construction site?

08:40.952 --> 08:42.251
A couple weeks ago,

08:42.287 --> 08:45.255
you would've slept in a dumpster
just to be alone with me.

08:45.290 --> 08:47.858
I gotta get to class.
I'll call you later, okay?

08:47.892 --> 08:49.926
Yeah, okay.

08:49.961 --> 08:52.429
I'll be
at the record store, so...

08:52.463 --> 08:54.698
Call me.

08:56.100 --> 08:58.034
You got yourself a smotherer.

08:58.069 --> 08:59.436
What? No, he's not.

08:59.470 --> 09:01.471
He just really likes
spending time with me.

09:01.506 --> 09:03.373
A guy who hangs all over you?

09:03.407 --> 09:05.408
At first,
it's all sweet and romantic.

09:05.443 --> 09:06.576
And then one day you're like,

09:06.611 --> 09:08.979
"Help! He's trying
to suffocate me!"

09:09.013 --> 09:10.146
Ring true?

09:10.181 --> 09:12.315
<i>And while</i>
<i>my sister was wondering</i>

09:12.350 --> 09:15.719
<i>if Miller was getting</i>
<i>too close...</i>

09:15.753 --> 09:19.189
<i>I was making sure my ex didn't.</i>

09:20.791 --> 09:22.792
<i>We each stayed</i>
<i>our separate course,</i>

09:22.827 --> 09:25.028
<i>like ships passing</i>
<i>in the night.</i>

09:25.062 --> 09:26.296
<i>But following the rules</i>

09:26.330 --> 09:28.531
<i>never had been</i>
<i>Sebastian's strong point.</i>

09:28.566 --> 09:30.400
Carrie, can I talk to you
for a minute?

09:30.434 --> 09:33.303
Uh, yeah. S-sure.

09:39.361 --> 09:41.193
I'm sorry to
come up and bother you.

09:41.313 --> 09:43.881
No, it's... it's no bother.
It's no big deal.

09:43.915 --> 09:45.316
So what's up?

09:45.350 --> 09:46.550
So this is awkward.

09:46.585 --> 09:48.419
No, it's not awkward.
It's...

09:48.453 --> 09:50.621
Okay. Maybe... maybe a little.

09:50.655 --> 09:52.923
Well, I meant
what I have to ask you.

09:52.958 --> 09:54.725
Oh.  Right.

09:54.759 --> 09:56.460
But this is awkward, too.

09:56.495 --> 09:59.330
Yeah, and I just made it
that much more so.

09:59.364 --> 10:02.333
Um, so what is it
you wanted to ask me?

10:02.367 --> 10:04.168
I was hoping I could
talk to your dad.

10:04.202 --> 10:06.704
Is everything okay?

10:06.738 --> 10:07.938
Are you in trouble?

10:07.973 --> 10:09.440
Believe it or not,
I am not in trouble.

10:09.474 --> 10:10.808
It's my mom.

10:10.842 --> 10:13.444
She's marrying
that tennis instructor.

10:13.478 --> 10:16.380
Wow. That's...

10:16.414 --> 10:19.683
Embarrassing. Awful.
Potentially tragic.

10:19.718 --> 10:21.852
I'm sorry. Are you okay?

10:21.886 --> 10:23.787
Pretty sure I blacked out
when she started talking about

10:23.822 --> 10:26.156
giving me a baby brother
or sister.

10:26.191 --> 10:29.159
I-I don't even know
what to say.

10:29.194 --> 10:31.695
I didn't think she could
surprise me, but...

10:31.729 --> 10:34.164
Well...
Whatever you need.

10:34.199 --> 10:35.666
I was hoping your dad could
give me some advice

10:35.700 --> 10:37.201
to make sure
my mom's protected.

10:37.235 --> 10:40.504
Yeah, of course. I know
he'd be happy to help you.

10:40.788 --> 10:42.189
Thanks.

10:42.223 --> 10:44.391
Mm-hmm.

10:44.425 --> 10:46.526
I thought you weren't talking
to Sebastian.

10:46.561 --> 10:48.028
I'm not.

10:48.062 --> 10:49.829
Carrie!

10:49.864 --> 10:52.299
You can't just open the door
to an ex.

10:52.333 --> 10:54.868
You give an ex an inch,
he'll take a mile.

10:54.902 --> 10:57.537
It's nothing like that.
Sebastian's...

10:57.571 --> 10:59.773
going through something.
I can't get into it.

10:59.807 --> 11:02.575
And I'm just helping him...
as a friend.

11:02.610 --> 11:03.910
I thought you said

11:03.944 --> 11:06.112
you and Sebastian
couldn't be friends.

11:06.147 --> 11:08.148
And you're keeping secrets with him now?

11:08.182 --> 11:09.315
This is worse than I thought.

11:09.350 --> 11:11.551
We both agreed you can't
be involved with him.

11:11.585 --> 11:12.585
I'm not.

11:12.620 --> 11:15.088
I just talked to him
in the hallway.

11:15.122 --> 11:17.924
I-I'm not writing about him
or involved with an ex,

11:17.958 --> 11:19.225
like some people.

11:19.260 --> 11:21.261
Still tormented by Katja?

11:21.295 --> 11:22.662
Mm. Completely.

11:22.696 --> 11:25.598
You know, I get that I'm not
allowed to read Weaver's play.

11:25.633 --> 11:27.033
But suddenly,

11:27.067 --> 11:28.668
I feel like there's all this
stuff that I should know about.

11:28.702 --> 11:30.637
Like how he felt about her?

11:30.671 --> 11:32.672
Yeah.
How he <i>feels</i> about her.

11:32.706 --> 11:33.940
I mean, for all I know...

11:33.974 --> 11:37.010
He's still pining, and I'm just
some pale substitute

11:37.044 --> 11:39.012
keeping Katja's space warm
in the bed

11:39.046 --> 11:41.514
until he can win her back.

11:41.548 --> 11:45.585
Wouldn't it be so weird
if you looked like her?

11:45.619 --> 11:47.820
Like one of those creepy
Hitchcock movies.

11:47.855 --> 11:48.988
Ha ha.

11:49.022 --> 11:50.590
I'm sure he's gonna bludgeon me
in the shower

11:50.624 --> 11:52.959
or have birds attack me.

11:52.993 --> 11:55.194
Just ask him about her.

11:55.229 --> 11:56.529
If Weaver was hiding something,

11:56.563 --> 11:58.464
he wouldn't have brought her up
in the first place.

11:58.498 --> 12:00.032
You're right.

12:00.067 --> 12:02.201
I'll do that.
I'll just ask him.

12:02.236 --> 12:06.205
But if you look like her,
I'd run for the hills.

12:06.239 --> 12:07.673
I have to go.

12:07.708 --> 12:10.509
West promised me he'd give me
feedback on my Homecoming float!

12:10.544 --> 12:12.011
Oh, poor West.

12:12.045 --> 12:16.182
So? What did you think?
Isn't it beautiful?

12:16.216 --> 12:17.483
Yeah. It... it looked good.

12:17.517 --> 12:19.185
Good? That's it?

12:19.219 --> 12:21.487
Didn't you love
the color ochre I picked?

12:21.521 --> 12:22.655
Sure.

12:22.689 --> 12:24.824
Sure?
It's awesomely autumnal.

12:24.858 --> 12:26.459
I guess.

12:26.493 --> 12:27.693
Just say it.

12:27.727 --> 12:29.728
You obviously don't like
the float.

12:29.763 --> 12:31.197
No, I do.

12:31.231 --> 12:33.232
It's just that it could a little
bit of... glitter or something.

12:33.266 --> 12:35.568
Glitter? I hate glitter.

12:35.602 --> 12:38.203
Glitter is messy and expensive

12:38.238 --> 12:40.139
and an insufficient use
of funds.

12:40.173 --> 12:42.007
Oh, my God. It's almost time.

12:42.042 --> 12:43.776
Countdown to the Homecoming King
and Queen results.

12:43.810 --> 12:45.110
I'm <i>dying.</i>

12:45.145 --> 12:47.146
I need to prepare
for my photo op.

12:47.180 --> 12:49.548
Blue mascara wand now.

12:49.582 --> 12:51.483
Wait. Who the hell are you?

12:51.518 --> 12:52.651
I'm Jen.

12:52.685 --> 12:54.887
What... what happened
to the other Jen?

12:54.921 --> 12:57.689
Her parents moved,
and actually, I prefer "Jenny."

12:57.724 --> 12:59.124
Actually...

12:59.159 --> 13:00.359
No, you don't.

13:03.296 --> 13:05.898
Homecoming monarchy
is so stupid.

13:05.932 --> 13:08.433
Why do we perpetuate
such archaic, empty figureheads

13:08.468 --> 13:10.235
to be filled by empty people?

13:10.270 --> 13:12.037
I move to abolish.

13:12.071 --> 13:14.606
<i> Class of 1986,</i>

13:14.641 --> 13:15.974
<i>hold on to your hats.</i>

13:16.009 --> 13:18.910
<i>Your Homecoming Queen is</i>
<i>the lovely Donna Ladonna!</i>

13:18.945 --> 13:20.112
Ohh!

13:20.146 --> 13:21.113
<i>And your Homecoming King...</i>

13:21.147 --> 13:23.382
<i>Star athlete and scholar</i>

13:23.416 --> 13:24.549
<i>Thomas West!</i>

13:25.752 --> 13:28.754
Did they just say
Thomas West? As in you?

13:28.788 --> 13:30.355
Yeah,
I think they did.

13:30.389 --> 13:32.424
Congratulations.

13:32.458 --> 13:35.961
You're meeting me at the gym,
right? To finish the float.

13:35.995 --> 13:37.662
Yeah. I-I'll try.

13:43.135 --> 13:45.337
Are you exhausted?

13:45.371 --> 13:48.206
Posing all day
must be so tiring.

13:48.241 --> 13:49.474
It's invigorating.

13:49.508 --> 13:50.942
Lounging around naked,
being admired

13:50.977 --> 13:52.611
is one of my favorite pastimes.

13:52.645 --> 13:55.213
Getting paid for
it's icing on the cake.

13:55.247 --> 13:56.414
And the best part of the deal

13:56.449 --> 13:57.982
is living here in the studio
at night.

13:58.017 --> 13:59.250
Thank you.

13:59.285 --> 14:03.154
Oh, I'm so glad
you're enjoying it.

14:03.189 --> 14:04.456
It's clean and it's spacious,

14:04.490 --> 14:07.158
and all the art depicts
a subject I love...

14:07.193 --> 14:09.194
my own nude form.

14:09.228 --> 14:10.762
This is Bob's work.

14:10.796 --> 14:12.263
He's got talent.

14:12.298 --> 14:14.866
See his use
of color and shadow?

14:14.900 --> 14:16.234
All I can see is how
he perfectly captured

14:16.268 --> 14:18.002
my fabulous bod.

14:19.772 --> 14:22.540
What the hell is this?!

14:22.575 --> 14:24.709
It's a broken heart.

14:24.743 --> 14:27.779
Obviously, Gordon sees
something in you...

14:27.813 --> 14:30.682
Something sad and wounded.

14:30.716 --> 14:32.784
There's no sadness in me.

14:32.818 --> 14:34.218
What a load of crap.

14:34.253 --> 14:37.088
In the divorce, my dad
had to pay a pretty penny,

14:37.122 --> 14:39.290
and I wanna make sure no one
can take that away from her.

14:39.324 --> 14:41.659
Well, and someday, that money
should be yours, Sebastian.

14:41.693 --> 14:42.794
I don't care about that.

14:42.828 --> 14:44.796
I only care
about protecting my mom.

14:44.830 --> 14:46.964
You are a great kid.

14:46.999 --> 14:49.100
My first impression about you
was way off,

14:49.134 --> 14:50.468
and I'm sorry about that.

14:50.502 --> 14:53.337
Well, no apology necessary.

14:53.372 --> 14:54.505
Your first impression of me

14:54.540 --> 14:56.073
was that I'd been
thrown out of school

14:56.108 --> 14:58.442
for having an affair
with my teacher.

14:58.477 --> 14:59.744
Not my finest moment.

14:59.778 --> 15:02.079
You were a kid that
got taken advantage of,

15:02.114 --> 15:03.547
and I should have
recognized that.

15:03.582 --> 15:05.416
Hey, I get it.

15:05.450 --> 15:07.318
If I had a daughter
like Carrie,

15:07.352 --> 15:08.886
I'd probably wouldn't
let any guy near her.

15:08.920 --> 15:11.422
Yeah. Carrie's something.

15:11.456 --> 15:13.591
Yes, she is.

15:13.625 --> 15:15.926
Well, I'd like to help you
myself, Sebastian,

15:15.961 --> 15:17.928
but I don't practice
family law.

15:17.963 --> 15:20.498
What I <i>can</i> do is give you
a list of excellent lawyers

15:20.532 --> 15:22.233
who specialize in prenups.

15:22.267 --> 15:23.501
That would be great.

15:23.535 --> 15:25.002
I'm sorry you have to deal
with this.

15:25.036 --> 15:26.670
It's a heavy burden to carry.

15:26.705 --> 15:29.573
Hey, as long as my mom's okay,
I'm all right.

15:29.608 --> 15:32.009
I'll, uh, I'll just run upstairs
and get you those phone numbers.

15:32.043 --> 15:34.878
- Okay?
- All right. Thanks, Mr. Bradshaw.

15:39.084 --> 15:40.517
Oh.

15:40.552 --> 15:42.853
Um... I-I knew
you were coming over.

15:42.887 --> 15:45.255
I-I just... I thought
you'd be gone by now.

15:45.290 --> 15:46.957
I hope I'm not intruding.

15:46.991 --> 15:48.392
Oh, it's okay.
We're pretty much done.

15:48.426 --> 15:49.960
And your dad was very helpful.

15:49.994 --> 15:51.795
Good. I'm glad.

15:51.830 --> 15:53.230
Why do you look like

15:53.264 --> 15:54.698
you've been finger-painting
with kindergartners?

15:54.732 --> 15:55.966
Oh.

15:56.000 --> 15:58.302
Yeah, I was helping Mouse
finish the float.

15:58.336 --> 15:59.570
And my painting skills

15:59.604 --> 16:01.238
are pretty much
at the kindergarten level.

16:01.272 --> 16:03.607
You're covered.

16:03.641 --> 16:05.709
You got paint in your hair.

16:09.781 --> 16:11.982
Hey, Carrie.

16:12.016 --> 16:13.150
Hello?

16:13.184 --> 16:14.451
Um, I-I was only helping out

16:14.485 --> 16:17.354
because West was too busy
with his Homecoming King duties.

16:17.388 --> 16:20.190
But I'm guessing Mouse
must be regretting

16:20.224 --> 16:21.658
asking me to pitch in.

16:21.693 --> 16:22.993
I bet not.

16:23.027 --> 16:24.728
Carrie, it's for you.
It's some guy named Weaver.

16:24.762 --> 16:26.396
Weaver?

16:27.465 --> 16:29.366
Uh...

16:29.400 --> 16:31.434
Oh, I see you found Sebastian.

16:31.469 --> 16:33.370
Yes, I did find Sebastian.

16:33.404 --> 16:36.139
Um, if you'll both excuse me
a second,

16:36.174 --> 16:38.308
I-I have to take
this... this call.

16:38.342 --> 16:40.410
Uh, it's from a friend.

16:40.444 --> 16:41.811
Weaver from work.

16:41.846 --> 16:43.113
He's a work friend.

16:43.147 --> 16:44.714
Ah. Is he a new hire
at "Interview"?

16:44.749 --> 16:46.316
You never mentioned him.

16:46.350 --> 16:48.885
Oh, um, sort of. He...

16:48.919 --> 16:50.320
He freelances.

16:52.490 --> 16:53.623
Weaver?

16:53.658 --> 16:55.492
- Hi.
- Hey.

16:55.526 --> 16:56.793
Can you hold on a minute?

16:56.827 --> 16:59.629
Uh, sure. Yeah, I think I've got
a few more quarters.

16:59.663 --> 17:01.231
Carrie, you're...
You're tied up, literally.

17:01.265 --> 17:02.932
I'm just gonna take off.
Okay?

17:02.967 --> 17:04.666
Um, yeah. Sure.

17:04.702 --> 17:06.502
I'll... I'll see you
at school.

17:06.537 --> 17:08.605
Night, Bradshaw.

17:08.638 --> 17:10.607
Night, Kydd.

17:13.042 --> 17:14.844
Hi.

17:14.878 --> 17:17.113
Sorry. Um, I can talk now.

17:17.146 --> 17:19.147
Great. Hey, who was that?

17:19.183 --> 17:21.017
Oh, that was just, um...

17:21.050 --> 17:22.352
One of my dad's clients.

17:22.386 --> 17:25.021
I've heard of doctor
house calls, but lawyers?

17:25.055 --> 17:26.955
I think this is a first.

17:26.991 --> 17:29.158
Yes, his... his clients...
they just pop in.

17:29.193 --> 17:30.326
He's... he's a lawyer

17:30.361 --> 17:31.928
who's extremely close
with his clients.

17:31.962 --> 17:33.396
Well, good for them.

17:33.430 --> 17:34.731
So I was thinking
maybe it might be fun

17:34.765 --> 17:37.300
to have an adventure in the city
Saturday.

17:37.334 --> 17:39.035
You and me.
Would you be up for that?

17:39.069 --> 17:40.403
A date?

17:40.437 --> 17:41.871
Saturday?

17:41.905 --> 17:43.039
Yes.

17:43.073 --> 17:45.308
Sure.
Yes, it's... it's a date.

17:45.342 --> 17:47.743
That was redundant,
wasn't it?

17:47.778 --> 17:49.345
- Kind of.
- Well, anyway,

17:49.379 --> 17:50.880
I'll... I'll just...
I'll see you then.

17:50.914 --> 17:52.415
Yeah, see you, Carrie.

17:55.052 --> 17:56.585
<i>They say the most intimate</i>
<i>thing you can do</i>

17:56.620 --> 17:58.287
<i>is lie with a man.</i>

17:58.322 --> 17:59.855
<i>I wasn't quite sure</i>
<i>what they would say</i>

17:59.890 --> 18:01.624
<i>about lying to two men.</i>

18:01.658 --> 18:03.826
<i>But it was starting to seem</i>
<i>like a problem.</i>

18:05.000 --> 18:11.074

18:12.481 --> 18:14.616
Sebastian was at your house?

18:14.650 --> 18:15.850
No, it's not what you think.

18:15.884 --> 18:17.752
He was there to talk to my dad

18:17.786 --> 18:19.621
about that thing
that he's going through

18:19.655 --> 18:21.489
that I can't tell you about.

18:21.523 --> 18:22.857
But then we started talking,

18:22.891 --> 18:25.727
and then he brushed paint chips
out of my hair.

18:25.761 --> 18:27.829
I warned you
not to open that door!

18:27.863 --> 18:29.664
Well, I just opened
my <i>real</i> door,

18:29.698 --> 18:31.032
not the metaphorical one.

18:31.066 --> 18:32.767
In this case,
there's no difference.

18:32.801 --> 18:34.502
I smell disaster.

18:34.536 --> 18:37.605
It's going to sabotage
your relationship with Weaver.

18:37.639 --> 18:39.106
I know it was a mistake.

18:39.141 --> 18:41.476
But I only opened the door
a crack. I can still fix it.

18:41.510 --> 18:42.877
Yes, you can.

18:42.911 --> 18:45.012
Just <i>slam</i> that door shut.

18:45.047 --> 18:47.148
I will.
The next time I see Sebastian,

18:47.182 --> 18:49.951
I'm just going back
to my lowered head nod thing.

18:49.985 --> 18:52.353
Good. And I'm going back
to finishing my float

18:52.387 --> 18:54.255
while my boyfriend is
off gallivanting

18:54.289 --> 18:56.490
with that dragon Donna Ladonna.

18:56.525 --> 18:58.092
Wait.
You don't actually care

18:58.126 --> 19:00.685
that Donna is Queen
to West's King, do you?

19:00.913 --> 19:02.280
Why should I care?

19:02.314 --> 19:03.748
They're only off getting their
photos taken with the mayor,

19:03.782 --> 19:04.916
while I'm slaving away,

19:04.950 --> 19:07.418
making this stupid float
for them to stand on.

19:07.452 --> 19:09.554
What girl wouldn't want her
boyfriend playing puppet monarch

19:09.588 --> 19:12.156
with a pouty sexpot?

19:12.191 --> 19:13.658
It's like a nightmare
come true.

19:13.692 --> 19:15.092
Come on, Mouse.

19:15.127 --> 19:17.361
You know West would never be
attracted to someone like Donna.

19:17.396 --> 19:20.631
He's so much cooler than that.

19:20.666 --> 19:22.366
Well, it's still annoying.

19:22.401 --> 19:24.435
And apparently West is so cool,

19:24.469 --> 19:27.271
he's the most popular boy
in school.

19:27.305 --> 19:28.639
Yeah, he is.

19:33.011 --> 19:35.946
<i>♪ He was born</i>
<i>in the summer ♪</i>

19:35.981 --> 19:38.516
<i>♪ of his 27th year</i>

19:38.550 --> 19:40.684
You know, when I first heard
this song,

19:40.719 --> 19:43.754
I started thinking that Grace
and I should move to Colorado.

19:43.788 --> 19:45.823
It just made the rockies
seem so magical.

19:45.857 --> 19:47.258
<i>♪ Behind him</i>

19:47.292 --> 19:48.792
oh. Hey.

19:48.827 --> 19:50.594
Surprise!
Hey!

19:50.629 --> 19:52.496
I invited Miller to dinner.

19:52.530 --> 19:53.797
His house is
under construction.

19:53.832 --> 19:55.599
How did you even know
about that?

19:55.634 --> 19:57.134
Well, he stopped by
this morning

19:57.168 --> 19:59.503
to give me this album...
John Denver...

19:59.537 --> 20:01.705
And, uh, we, uh,
we got to talking.

20:01.740 --> 20:03.374
Maybe I should leave you
to talking.

20:03.408 --> 20:05.209
Seems like you really enjoy
each other's company.

20:05.243 --> 20:06.477
Wouldn't want to get
in the way.

20:06.511 --> 20:08.078
I know
I'm the third wheel here.

20:08.113 --> 20:09.613
It's just nice
having someone around

20:09.647 --> 20:11.548
who appreciates my music.

20:11.583 --> 20:13.517
Didn't realize
you were into folk music.

20:13.551 --> 20:14.885
Didn't you tell me

20:14.919 --> 20:17.521
the banjo was the most annoying
instrument ever invented?

20:17.555 --> 20:19.156
I like all music.

20:19.190 --> 20:21.158
And besides, it was
really cool of your dad

20:21.192 --> 20:24.127
to rescue me from another night
of fruity pebbles.

20:24.162 --> 20:25.629
You know what?

20:25.663 --> 20:27.397
There is no reason you should
have to suffer like that

20:27.432 --> 20:29.967
for another week.
Why don't you stay with us?

20:30.001 --> 20:31.168
Huh? As long as it's okay
with your parents.

20:31.202 --> 20:33.403
Well, they'll be
totally okay with it.

20:33.438 --> 20:35.639
I'm sure they'll be thrilled
to get me out of that dust pit.

20:35.673 --> 20:37.341
Are you serious?

20:37.375 --> 20:40.577
You're actually inviting my
boyfriend to stay in our house?

20:40.611 --> 20:42.212
This is just freaky.

20:42.246 --> 20:44.915
Miller can stay with rules,
of course.

20:44.949 --> 20:48.251
He sleeps on the sofa.
Doors are kept open.

20:48.286 --> 20:50.787
See, Dorrit? Your dad's not
quite as square as you think.

20:50.822 --> 20:52.289
Huh? So what do you say?

20:52.323 --> 20:53.623
That would be rad.

20:53.658 --> 20:55.125
Besides,
with our busy schedules,

20:55.159 --> 20:57.260
it'll be nice to get
some time together.

20:57.295 --> 21:00.864
Welcome to the Bradshaw Hotel.

21:00.898 --> 21:02.198
Did you see the look
on the mayor's face

21:02.233 --> 21:04.935
when you shook his hand?
I think you crushed it.

21:04.969 --> 21:06.303
I guess I have
a strong handshake.

21:06.337 --> 21:08.605
I love a man with strong hands.

21:08.639 --> 21:09.839
Hey, babe.
How's the float coming?

21:09.874 --> 21:11.041
What is that?

21:11.075 --> 21:13.543
Are your eyes impaired
along with your brain?

21:13.577 --> 21:15.578
It's a pumpkin
for the front of the float.

21:15.613 --> 21:18.181
Pumpkins signify autumn,
the harvest.

21:18.215 --> 21:20.784
Pumpkins signify just one thing
to me... the hideous color orange.

21:20.818 --> 21:22.352
Orange clashes
with my complexion.

21:22.386 --> 21:26.823
I'm best in cool colors...
blues, violet, pale green.

21:26.857 --> 21:30.093
Trash the pumpkin and make
some grapes or something.

21:30.127 --> 21:31.528
I will not trash the pumpkin.

21:31.562 --> 21:33.429
I'm your Queen,
and...

21:33.464 --> 21:35.098
I command you to trash it.

21:35.132 --> 21:37.333
You are going to ride
an orange float and like it.

21:37.368 --> 21:39.102
I refuse to ride
on a drab float.

21:39.136 --> 21:40.403
At least spruce it up
with some glitter.

21:40.437 --> 21:42.538
<i>Glitter?</i>

21:44.108 --> 21:46.943
You both love glitter so much,
why don't you finish the float?

21:49.346 --> 21:50.947
Commoners can be so touchy.

21:50.981 --> 21:52.648
Mouse, what's wrong?

21:52.683 --> 21:54.117
There's nothing wrong!

21:54.151 --> 21:56.252
What makes you think
there's anything wrong?

21:56.286 --> 21:58.955
You've been edgy ever since
the whole Homecoming King thing.

22:01.058 --> 22:02.391
Are you jealous of Donna?

22:02.426 --> 22:05.261
You think I'd be jealous of that
empty-headed blow-up doll?

22:05.295 --> 22:06.829
But you're obviously upset.

22:06.864 --> 22:10.032
Look...

22:10.067 --> 22:13.502
I know I'm not popular.

22:13.537 --> 22:16.138
I know most people
don't like me.

22:16.173 --> 22:17.540
Mouse, that's crazy.

22:17.574 --> 22:19.408
I love you,
and so do your friends.

22:21.211 --> 22:22.345
That amounts to

22:22.379 --> 22:25.381
all of around
four people on earth,

22:25.415 --> 22:28.484
plus my parents, who are
essentially forced to love me.

22:28.518 --> 22:31.687
So... that doesn't count.

22:31.721 --> 22:32.922
The number doesn't matter.

22:32.956 --> 22:34.890
Hey, math genius.

22:36.593 --> 22:38.294
Numbers always matter.

22:47.804 --> 22:49.438
<i>And there he was...</i>

22:49.472 --> 22:51.707
<i>The ex who had become too close.</i>

22:51.741 --> 22:54.777
<i>I was determined to return</i>
<i>to our post-mating dance...</i>

22:54.811 --> 22:57.179
<i>The ritual that ensured</i>
<i>our separateness.</i>

22:57.213 --> 22:59.515
<i>Just two ships</i>
<i>passing in the night.</i>

22:59.549 --> 23:02.918
<i>But a wave of concern</i>
<i>unexpectedly washed over me,</i>

23:02.952 --> 23:04.720
<i>and suddenly I was shipwrecked.</i>

23:04.754 --> 23:06.422
Hey.

23:06.456 --> 23:08.090
You okay?

23:08.124 --> 23:09.892
Yeah.

23:09.926 --> 23:12.728
I know you,
and you're not okay.

23:16.166 --> 23:18.967
I got in a fight with my mom.

23:19.002 --> 23:21.236
I tried to talk to her
about a prenup.

23:21.271 --> 23:22.437
Did not go well.

23:22.472 --> 23:24.139
She gave me an ultimatum...

23:24.173 --> 23:25.307
either I show up at her wedding

23:25.341 --> 23:27.175
or she'll cut me out
of her life.

23:27.210 --> 23:28.844
Mm. What are you gonna do?

23:28.878 --> 23:30.746
Show up, stand there,

23:30.780 --> 23:34.349
and watch my mother make
this huge mistake.

23:34.384 --> 23:36.284
This is why you're supposed
to have siblings,

23:36.319 --> 23:38.820
so you don't have to go through
this kind of hell alone.

23:38.855 --> 23:40.989
Do you want me to go with you?

23:41.023 --> 23:43.291
Oh, yeah, no.
You don't have to do that.

23:43.326 --> 23:45.327
I wasn't fishing for an offer.

23:45.361 --> 23:47.295
No, I know.
I'd really like to go.

23:47.330 --> 23:49.931
I-I don't mean I'd really like
to go because it sounds fun.

23:49.966 --> 23:51.132
I mean, it sounds awful.

23:51.167 --> 23:55.604
I just... I'd like
to be there for you.

23:55.638 --> 23:57.572
Okay. Well...

23:57.607 --> 24:00.008
if you mean it,
I'd love the company.

24:00.042 --> 24:02.544
Yeah, of course.

24:02.578 --> 24:04.379
Um, when is it?

24:04.413 --> 24:07.215
This weekend. My mom doesn't
believe in waiting.

24:07.249 --> 24:09.017
Saturday?

24:09.051 --> 24:10.285
Yeah, Saturday night.

24:10.319 --> 24:12.454
I-I totally get it
if you have other plans.

24:12.488 --> 24:13.621
Don't worry about it.

24:13.656 --> 24:14.789
Oh. Uh...

24:14.824 --> 24:17.225
Well, I have to be in the city
during the day.

24:17.259 --> 24:18.793
Uh, just for work.

24:18.828 --> 24:21.162
But, um, I can be there.

24:21.197 --> 24:22.530
Yeah. Yeah, I'll be there.

24:22.565 --> 24:24.399
Are you sure?

24:24.433 --> 24:26.134
Totally sure.

24:26.168 --> 24:27.969
Yeah, one thing's during
the day, the other's at night.

24:28.003 --> 24:29.971
It... it's no problem.

24:30.005 --> 24:32.106
All right, thanks, Carrie.

24:34.143 --> 24:37.879
<i>I'd meant to close the door on</i>
<i>my relationship with Sebastian.</i>

24:37.913 --> 24:41.215
<i>Instead, I'd opened</i>
<i>a can of worms.</i>

24:47.182 --> 24:49.588
I've never walked across
a bridge before.

24:49.708 --> 24:52.488
The Brooklyn bridge is one of
my favorite spots in the city.

24:52.608 --> 24:55.107
It's got an awesome history.

24:55.227 --> 24:56.810
It's so beautiful.

24:56.844 --> 24:59.012
It's like magic
that it even exists.

24:59.046 --> 25:00.213
All those wires and concrete.

25:00.247 --> 25:02.649
And the bridge was a beast
to build.

25:02.683 --> 25:05.785
The... the first builder
crushed his foot and died,

25:05.820 --> 25:07.320
so then his son took over.

25:07.354 --> 25:08.822
But then his son got
decompression sickness

25:08.856 --> 25:10.824
from working
in the submerged towers,

25:10.858 --> 25:12.058
so his wife trained
as an engineer

25:12.092 --> 25:13.393
to execute his plans.

25:13.427 --> 25:15.461
I mean, so much happened,
but in the end,

25:15.496 --> 25:16.663
the bridge turned out to be

25:16.697 --> 25:19.566
six times stronger
than it needed to be.

25:19.600 --> 25:21.301
Are you still in love
with Katja?

25:21.335 --> 25:24.170
What? No.

25:24.404 --> 25:27.073
It's just, you're writing
a play about her.

25:27.107 --> 25:29.509
And I know I can't read it,
which is fine.

25:29.543 --> 25:31.544
But you're spending
all your time

25:31.578 --> 25:33.613
thinking about some other girl,

25:33.647 --> 25:35.881
and all I know is
her name is Katja.

25:35.916 --> 25:38.951
That's... kind of
worrying me.

25:38.986 --> 25:40.086
Are you still into her?

25:40.120 --> 25:41.253
<i>No.</i>

25:41.288 --> 25:43.823
No. Katja is
a psycho bitch.

25:43.857 --> 25:44.991
Oh!

25:45.025 --> 25:46.359
Thank God.

25:46.393 --> 25:48.027
I mean, I'm sorry.

25:48.061 --> 25:50.296
But... sort of relieved.

25:50.330 --> 25:51.597
No, I was, uh,

25:51.631 --> 25:54.200
look, I was in a bad place
when I was dating Katja.

25:54.234 --> 25:56.802
Staying up late, partying,

25:56.837 --> 25:58.604
not being productive.

25:58.638 --> 25:59.972
Writing about Katja is

26:00.006 --> 26:02.408
my way of letting go of
that painful time in my life.

26:02.442 --> 26:04.243
I totally get that.

26:04.277 --> 26:06.278
That relationship is a lot like
the Brooklyn bridge.

26:06.313 --> 26:09.081
You know, a lot of people went
through a lot to build it,

26:09.115 --> 26:13.252
but now there's
this magical bridge.

26:13.286 --> 26:14.420
You're the bridge.

26:14.454 --> 26:16.455
I'm the bridge?

26:16.489 --> 26:19.758
Strong
yet incredibly beautiful.

26:19.793 --> 26:22.127
Oh, you really are gifted with words.

26:22.162 --> 26:23.529
Hey, hey.

26:23.563 --> 26:26.765
I promise, Katja is nothing
to be upset about.

26:26.800 --> 26:28.367
Okay, it's not like I'm still
in contact with her.

26:28.401 --> 26:30.369
If I was,
that would be a problem.

26:30.403 --> 26:32.638
It would?

26:32.672 --> 26:34.173
Yeah.

26:34.207 --> 26:36.909
You can't move on while you're
still entangled with an ex.

26:36.943 --> 26:39.411
It's just too tricky.

26:39.445 --> 26:41.213
Yeah. So...

26:41.247 --> 26:44.149
H-hypothetically,
it would be a problem for you

26:44.183 --> 26:46.218
if I was still close to an ex?

26:46.252 --> 26:47.586
Yeah.

26:50.657 --> 26:52.324
Oh, no!

26:52.358 --> 26:56.061
Hey, here. Come on.

27:03.503 --> 27:06.138
It's lucky that your parents
live so close to the bridge.

27:06.172 --> 27:09.441
And even luckier that they're
out of town, since I hate them.

27:10.710 --> 27:12.978
Here. Here's some clothes
if you wanna change.

27:13.012 --> 27:15.413
Bathroom's down the hall.

27:15.448 --> 27:17.382
It's... they're not
Carrie Bradshaw chic,

27:17.416 --> 27:18.617
but at least they're dry.

27:18.651 --> 27:20.418
Thank you.

27:20.453 --> 27:22.320
Oh, and there should be
one towel in there.

27:22.355 --> 27:23.688
Um, I'll go hunt for some more.

27:23.723 --> 27:26.191
Okay. Can you also hunt
for some food?

27:26.225 --> 27:27.192
I'm starving.

27:27.226 --> 27:28.393
They've been gone for weeks.

27:28.427 --> 27:30.662
I doubt there's anything
but some stale crackers.

27:30.696 --> 27:32.964
No worries. I always have
emergency fruit.

27:32.998 --> 27:35.200
Can you go upstairs and grab
the banana from my purse?

27:35.234 --> 27:36.601
Wait. I-I'm sorry. You...

27:36.635 --> 27:38.336
You carry fruit in your purse?

27:38.370 --> 27:39.871
Yeah. That's how
my mother raised me.

27:39.905 --> 27:42.340
Oh. That way, I always
have a provision

27:42.374 --> 27:43.975
in case of an emergency.

27:44.009 --> 27:46.311
You know,
like a sudden rainstorm

27:46.345 --> 27:47.512
in the middle of a date.

27:47.546 --> 27:49.480
But doesn't... doesn't the fruit
get smooshed?

27:49.515 --> 27:51.683
Not if you wrap it neatly
in a napkin.

27:51.717 --> 27:53.651
Oh.
Which reminds me,

27:53.686 --> 27:56.220
please bring down my banana
and my napkin.

27:56.255 --> 27:58.790
- At your service.
-  - Thanks.

27:58.824 --> 28:01.559
All right, time's up for today.

28:01.593 --> 28:04.662
So I'll see you all in class
on Monday.

28:10.035 --> 28:12.036
You're Gordon, aren't you?

28:12.071 --> 28:13.571
Yeah.

28:13.605 --> 28:15.406
Your work's very intense.

28:15.441 --> 28:19.010
I bet you're <i>intense</i> about
a lot of things.

28:29.655 --> 28:31.155
Ugh!

28:31.189 --> 28:32.965
My feet are killing me.

28:34.059 --> 28:36.861
I thought being queen was gonna
be about handmaidens serving <i>me,</i>

28:36.895 --> 28:38.863
but instead <i>I'm</i> serving
the unwashed masses

28:38.897 --> 28:40.231
like Mother Frickin' Theresa.

28:40.265 --> 28:42.499
Come on.
You know you love it.

28:42.534 --> 28:46.604
Well, it is
what I was born to do.

28:46.638 --> 28:49.106
So how's it going
with the smotherer?

28:50.608 --> 28:52.443
You might've been right
about him.

28:52.477 --> 28:53.610
How far has it gotten?

28:53.645 --> 28:55.379
Is he showing up at your house
unannounced?

28:55.413 --> 28:58.248
Worse. He got my dad to let him
move <i>into</i> my house.

28:58.283 --> 29:00.751
Ugh. This <i>is</i> a bad case.

29:00.785 --> 29:02.286
He wasn't always like this.

29:02.320 --> 29:03.987
It seems like once I started
school and got busy,

29:04.022 --> 29:05.155
he got clingy-er.

29:05.190 --> 29:06.590
Classic progression.

29:06.624 --> 29:08.091
And what's so weird

29:08.126 --> 29:09.927
is that I was in love with him,
like, a week ago.

29:09.961 --> 29:11.628
I loved the songs he wrote.

29:11.663 --> 29:14.398
And it's not just his stupid
songs that make me wanna puke.

29:14.432 --> 29:16.600
Even the color of his lips
are barfy.

29:16.634 --> 29:18.068
He curdled.

29:18.102 --> 29:20.404
All men have expiration dates,
like milk.

29:20.438 --> 29:22.639
Once they've turned,
they've gotta be tossed.

29:22.674 --> 29:23.907
I don't know
if Miller's curdled

29:23.942 --> 29:25.542
or if it's having him
in the midst of my family

29:25.576 --> 29:26.777
that's making me sick.

29:26.811 --> 29:28.745
Go home and double-check.

29:28.780 --> 29:32.616
If he's gone sour, you'll know.

29:32.650 --> 29:33.784
Much better,

29:33.818 --> 29:36.353
though these sweatpants are
a wee bit too long.

29:36.387 --> 29:37.788
Did you find my banana?

29:40.925 --> 29:43.126
That's not my banana.
That's my journal.

29:43.161 --> 29:44.261
What are you doing?

29:52.540 --> 29:54.141
You're reading my journal?

29:54.175 --> 29:56.510
It... it was right there
next to the banana, and I...

29:56.544 --> 29:59.646
What, and you felt compelled
to open it up and... and read it?

29:59.681 --> 30:02.216
You, who lectured me
on how writing is sacred?

30:02.250 --> 30:04.051
I know. It's... it's...
It's a total double standard.

30:04.085 --> 30:05.219
I don't know what came over me.

30:05.253 --> 30:06.453
Okay, I've... I've...

30:06.488 --> 30:08.555
I've never done anything
like this before, ever.

30:08.590 --> 30:12.159
I mean, some... something
about you, I-I lose my senses.

30:12.193 --> 30:13.494
Ugh. Don't try that on me.

30:13.528 --> 30:15.162
You can't flatter your way
out of this one. I'm not.

30:15.196 --> 30:17.397
I just... I-I wanna know
everything about you,

30:17.432 --> 30:19.233
everything you're thinking.

30:19.267 --> 30:22.436
Every thought in... in that...
that beautiful, crazy,

30:22.470 --> 30:24.104
interesting head of yours,
and it was...

30:24.138 --> 30:27.007
it was right there,
like, beckoning me, okay?

30:27.041 --> 30:28.241
And I...

30:29.444 --> 30:30.844
Ugh. I-I...

30:32.080 --> 30:34.114
It's no excuse.

30:34.148 --> 30:35.649
I'm so sorry.

30:35.683 --> 30:38.118
You should be.

30:38.152 --> 30:40.120
But in a way,
I'm almost glad I did,

30:40.154 --> 30:42.722
because we... we clearly have
a lot to talk about.

30:44.592 --> 30:46.927
Yeah. Uh, I guess...

30:46.961 --> 30:48.161
We do.

30:50.398 --> 30:52.566
I-I've tried to tell you.

30:52.600 --> 30:54.601
I just...
I don't know how.

30:54.635 --> 30:56.102
You just say it.

30:56.137 --> 30:57.704
Be honest.

30:57.738 --> 30:58.872
Look, it's more complicated
for me

30:58.906 --> 31:00.106
because we go to
high school together...

31:00.141 --> 31:02.309
There's nothing complicated
about being a virgin.

31:02.343 --> 31:03.977
It's not something
you should feel weird about,

31:04.011 --> 31:05.712
but it's kind of something
I should know.

31:05.746 --> 31:07.647
What?

31:07.682 --> 31:09.416
Oh.

31:09.450 --> 31:11.618
Wow. Right.

31:11.652 --> 31:13.787
I mean, why... why would you
keep that from me?

31:13.821 --> 31:17.057
I just didn't want to make it
seem important.

31:17.091 --> 31:19.659
I did that once before,
and... and it blew up in my face.

31:19.693 --> 31:21.461
It <i>is</i> important.

31:21.495 --> 31:25.064
Having sex for the first time
is a big deal.

31:25.099 --> 31:28.801
I mean, look,
things have been great

31:28.836 --> 31:30.103
and heading in
a certain direction,

31:30.137 --> 31:32.805
at least, I hope.

31:32.840 --> 31:34.140
But if I'm gonna be your first,

31:34.174 --> 31:35.508
I want it to mean something.

31:35.542 --> 31:37.543
Yeah. I know.

31:37.578 --> 31:40.780
I-I just don't want it
to become this big thing

31:40.814 --> 31:42.248
that just takes over.

31:42.282 --> 31:45.952
I get it. But I want you
to be open with me.

31:45.986 --> 31:50.223
I... I really like you,
Carrie.

31:50.257 --> 31:52.692
So much.

31:52.726 --> 31:55.661
And you... your first time
should be special.

31:55.696 --> 31:57.964
Hopefully, it can... it can
be special with me.

32:02.703 --> 32:05.371
- Carrie...
- No, don't talk.

32:05.405 --> 32:06.539
But are you sure?

32:06.573 --> 32:08.174
Really sure. I'm ready.

32:08.208 --> 32:09.842
<i>- Sure</i> sure?
- Totally sure.

32:11.411 --> 32:12.712
Ow!

32:12.746 --> 32:14.413
- Are you okay?
-  - Oh. Yeah, I just...

32:14.448 --> 32:17.383
I hit my elbow
on the foosball table.

32:23.724 --> 32:26.192
Miller!

32:26.226 --> 32:27.693
We have to talk.

32:32.799 --> 32:36.468
Do you know you're like
a Greek goddess?

32:36.503 --> 32:39.538
Making love to you is like
floating in a dream.

32:40.807 --> 32:42.775
Well, your dream is about to
become a nightmare.

32:42.809 --> 32:44.209
Put your pants on and get out.

32:44.244 --> 32:45.911
W-what? What... what happened?

32:45.979 --> 32:47.613
What happened is,
I only had sex with you

32:47.647 --> 32:49.214
to prove what a bad artist
you are.

32:49.249 --> 32:50.382
You depicted me as

32:50.417 --> 32:52.584
a pathetic sad sack
with a broken heart.

32:52.619 --> 32:54.153
I couldn't possibly have
a broken heart

32:54.187 --> 32:56.889
because as you know now,
I don't have a heart.

32:56.923 --> 32:59.258
That wasn't your heart
in the painting. It was mine.

32:59.292 --> 33:00.993
What are you talking about?

33:01.027 --> 33:02.728
<i>My</i> heart is broken.

33:02.762 --> 33:04.897
My girlfriend just dumped me.

33:04.931 --> 33:06.098
I'm in so much pain,

33:06.132 --> 33:07.599
I don't know what to do
with my feelings.

33:07.634 --> 33:09.268
My shrink
told me to pour it into my art.

33:09.302 --> 33:10.536
This isn't happening.

33:10.570 --> 33:12.070
Alice left me
for a chiropractor.

33:12.105 --> 33:13.238
Can you believe that?

33:13.273 --> 33:15.207
He drives
a station wagon

33:15.241 --> 33:17.009
and lives in Scarsdale.

33:17.043 --> 33:19.678
Dude, you need to grow a pair.

33:22.115 --> 33:23.649
Miller, I did love you so much,

33:23.683 --> 33:25.417
but I just don't feel it
anymore.

33:25.451 --> 33:27.085
I'm sorry. It's over.

33:27.120 --> 33:29.621
What, you're...
Breaking up with me?

33:29.655 --> 33:32.457
Yeah. That's what
"It's over" means.

33:32.492 --> 33:34.593
I don't understand what I did.

33:34.627 --> 33:35.761
Well, for starters,

33:35.795 --> 33:36.928
you weaseled your way
into staying at my house

33:36.963 --> 33:40.198
by working my dad,
which is just gross.

33:40.233 --> 33:42.834
Well, I thought you'd be happy
about my staying here.

33:42.869 --> 33:44.136
You thought wrong.

33:44.170 --> 33:46.037
Dorrit, you can't break up
with me.

33:46.072 --> 33:47.606
I'm still in love with you.

33:47.640 --> 33:49.941
You're just in love
with the idea of me.

33:49.976 --> 33:51.643
You'll get over it.

33:51.677 --> 33:53.678
I just wrote a new love song
for you.

33:53.713 --> 33:55.880
Just let me get my guitar.
I'll play it.

33:55.915 --> 33:58.116
Miller,
don't embarrass yourself.

33:58.150 --> 34:00.318
You should go. Now.

34:02.421 --> 34:05.023
<i>It was nothing like</i>
<i>I'd imagined.</i>

34:05.057 --> 34:07.759
<i>It was on a couch</i>
<i>in a rec room.</i>

34:07.793 --> 34:09.994
<i>No rose petals or champagne.</i>

34:10.029 --> 34:11.629
Mmm.

34:11.664 --> 34:13.164
<i>But it was perfect.</i>

34:13.199 --> 34:14.933
How are you feeling?

34:14.967 --> 34:17.302
I feel good.

34:18.904 --> 34:20.905
We're getting married tonight,
right?

34:20.940 --> 34:22.907
Mm, of course.

34:22.942 --> 34:24.775
Oh, what time is it?

34:24.810 --> 34:28.112
Hey, we'd better hurry
before the chapel closes.

34:29.581 --> 34:31.583
What?

34:31.617 --> 34:32.817
Oh, no.

34:32.851 --> 34:35.152
- Oh!
- There isn't really a chapel.

34:35.187 --> 34:36.387
No, I-I-I know. It's...

34:36.422 --> 34:38.856
What time is it?
Uh, it's... it's 6:00.

34:38.891 --> 34:40.091
6:00?!

34:40.125 --> 34:42.159
Hey, what's wrong?

34:42.194 --> 34:43.995
I-I-I'm supposed
to be somewhere.

34:45.164 --> 34:47.130
Oh, crap!

34:57.276 --> 35:00.511
Sebastian?
What are you doing out here?

35:00.546 --> 35:02.680
You're not trying to delay
the wedding in protest, are you?

35:02.714 --> 35:04.248
No. I'm just waiting
for a friend.

35:04.283 --> 35:05.783
Well, come inside.

35:05.817 --> 35:07.551
You don't want to be late
for your mother's wedding.

35:07.586 --> 35:09.253
I'll be in in a minute.
Promise.

35:21.433 --> 35:24.602
Mouse?
What are you doing here?

35:24.636 --> 35:26.270
Carrie's been trying
to reach you.

35:26.304 --> 35:28.806
There's no answer
at your house.

35:28.840 --> 35:31.976
She missed her train and asked
me to be here in her place.

35:32.010 --> 35:35.246
Oh. Well, you didn't
have to come, Mouse.

35:35.280 --> 35:38.048
But thanks. It means a lot.

35:38.083 --> 35:39.717
You bet.

35:54.277 --> 35:56.868
Ohh. That was the best
grilled cheese sandwich

35:56.988 --> 35:58.222
I have ever tasted.

35:58.256 --> 35:59.657
It's the bacon
that makes it, right?

35:59.691 --> 36:01.225
Totally.

36:01.259 --> 36:03.861
The bacon was like...
Mmm, heaven.

36:03.895 --> 36:05.029
Hey, you gotta love
New York delis.

36:05.063 --> 36:06.196
I mean, where else can you get

36:06.231 --> 36:08.799
greasy food delivered
around the clock?

36:09.901 --> 36:13.871
I need to talk to you
about something.

36:13.905 --> 36:15.973
You were really honest
with me about Katja,

36:16.007 --> 36:18.609
and I haven't been
fully upfront with you.

36:18.643 --> 36:20.777
Okay.

36:20.812 --> 36:24.014
I have been in close contact
with my ex.

36:24.048 --> 36:26.283
How close?

36:26.317 --> 36:28.185
Just as friends.

36:28.219 --> 36:32.623
But I-I was going to go with him
to his mom's wedding tonight.

36:32.657 --> 36:36.059
Which is why you were so upset
you missed your train.

36:36.094 --> 36:37.961
Yes.

36:37.996 --> 36:40.530
But the truth is,
I'm glad I missed it.

36:40.565 --> 36:43.767
This is where I wanna be,
with you,

36:43.801 --> 36:46.069
and I'm going to shut the door
with him

36:46.104 --> 36:49.673
and lock it
so it can't be opened.

36:53.244 --> 36:55.912
I recommend dead bolts...

36:55.947 --> 36:57.581
And a chain.

36:57.615 --> 36:58.748
And one of those crazy bars

36:58.783 --> 37:01.084
that goes between the door
and the floor.

37:01.118 --> 37:03.086
I'm sorry I didn't
tell you everything earlier.

37:03.120 --> 37:04.821
It's okay.

37:04.855 --> 37:05.989
I mean, after all,

37:06.023 --> 37:08.758
I am the schmuck
who read your journal today,

37:08.793 --> 37:10.226
so we're more than even.

37:10.261 --> 37:12.262
Thank you.

37:18.502 --> 37:20.804
Is, uh, is it too soon?

37:20.838 --> 37:23.006
I don't think so.

37:30.514 --> 37:32.448
Oh, hey.

37:32.483 --> 37:34.183
Dorrit...

37:34.218 --> 37:36.486
I'm really sorry things
didn't work out with Miller.

37:36.520 --> 37:38.488
I'm not.

37:38.522 --> 37:40.757
Oh!

37:40.791 --> 37:43.660
He forgot
his stones t-shirt.

37:43.694 --> 37:45.828
It's his favorite shirt.

37:45.863 --> 37:47.930
Should I try and get
it back to him? No.

37:49.166 --> 37:51.667
We had some killer
jam sessions.

37:53.804 --> 37:55.772
Dad...

37:55.806 --> 37:58.441
Never, ever become friends
with one of my boyfriends again.

37:58.475 --> 38:00.977
Okay. Got it.

38:09.786 --> 38:11.387
Hey.

38:11.421 --> 38:13.522
Hey. You skipped out
on Homecoming.

38:13.557 --> 38:15.024
I know.

38:15.058 --> 38:16.459
I know you weren't psyched
that I was Homecoming King,

38:16.493 --> 38:18.561
but you didn't need
to miss out on your float.

38:18.595 --> 38:19.996
It got raves.

38:20.030 --> 38:22.531
Everyone loved the pumpkin.

38:22.566 --> 38:25.134
West, I didn't miss it
because you were king.

38:25.168 --> 38:27.203
I missed it because
Sebastian needed me,

38:27.237 --> 38:28.637
and I knew you'd be fine.

38:28.672 --> 38:31.373
His mom married the tennis pro
from the club.

38:31.408 --> 38:33.409
Whoa. Is he okay?

38:33.443 --> 38:36.479
I'm glad I could be there
for him.

38:36.513 --> 38:38.380
You're a great friend,

38:38.415 --> 38:40.382
and I can't think of anything
more important than that.

38:40.417 --> 38:42.184
It's not how many people
like you.

38:42.219 --> 38:43.819
It's the quality
of those relationships.

38:43.853 --> 38:46.088
I know. You're right.

38:46.122 --> 38:48.490
Wow. Did you actually just
admit that I was right?

38:48.525 --> 38:49.992
I might need this in writing.

38:50.026 --> 38:52.494
This is a date
for the record books.

38:53.697 --> 38:55.030
Well, enjoy it while you can

38:55.065 --> 38:57.533
because it's not likely
to happen again soon.

38:57.567 --> 39:00.202
And I hope you enjoy this.

39:00.236 --> 39:03.172
I'm sorry I missed
your coronation.

39:03.206 --> 39:05.808
I thought I could make it up
to you by crowning you myself.

39:05.842 --> 39:08.343
Used tons of extra glitter.

39:08.378 --> 39:11.213
Thanks. And you're right.
Glitter is a sticky mess.

39:11.247 --> 39:13.248
Yeah.

39:19.656 --> 39:22.357
<i>Intimacy is a mysterious thing.</i>

40:19.748 --> 40:20.949
Carrie!

40:20.983 --> 40:22.617
Did you get a facial
at that place Mario Badescu

40:22.651 --> 40:24.018
Larissa told us about?

40:24.053 --> 40:26.120
Your skin is glowing.
I know that glow,

40:26.155 --> 40:27.789
and that's not from a facial.

40:30.025 --> 40:31.159
Did you really do it?!

40:31.193 --> 40:33.027
Yes.

40:33.062 --> 40:34.662
Ha! Thank God.

40:34.697 --> 40:36.965
How was it?

40:36.999 --> 40:41.035
It was lovely and special
and totally unexpected.

40:41.070 --> 40:43.237
Hopefully not so unexpected
that you were unprepared.

40:43.272 --> 40:44.338
Oh, gosh, no. No.

40:44.373 --> 40:46.841
We used... protection,
of course.

40:46.875 --> 40:49.177
Did it hurt?
Because when I first did it,

40:49.211 --> 40:51.646
it hurt more than having
my wisdom teeth removed,

40:51.680 --> 40:53.047
which was excruciating.

40:53.081 --> 40:56.751
So? How bad was it?

40:56.785 --> 40:58.753
I-I don't think I'm ready

40:58.787 --> 41:01.422
to talk about the intimate
details of the deed.

41:01.456 --> 41:03.057
No fair!

41:03.091 --> 41:04.625
We've waited this long
to hear the good stuff.

41:04.660 --> 41:07.161
I kinda wait to keep
the good stuff to myself,

41:07.195 --> 41:08.329
if that's okay.

41:08.363 --> 41:10.164
Party pooper.

41:10.198 --> 41:11.799
But you're happy?

41:11.833 --> 41:14.168
Really happy.

41:14.202 --> 41:16.671
<i>Some milestones are so special,</i>

41:16.705 --> 41:20.074
