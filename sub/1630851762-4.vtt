Yeah, we got

00:27.235 --> 00:28.820
There's volleyball
over there.

00:28.903 --> 00:30.447
And... we got food comin'.

00:30.530 --> 00:32.991
Don't worry.
I know y'all hungry.
There's food comin'.

00:33.074 --> 00:34.367
Aight.

00:36.202 --> 00:37.370
Ah, shit.

00:37.454 --> 00:38.663
It's two already?

00:38.747 --> 00:40.373
This my third coat
of sunscreen.

00:40.457 --> 00:43.918
You know you missin'
your whole backside, right?

00:44.002 --> 00:46.421
I'm always facin'
the sun, though.

00:46.504 --> 00:49.132
- Well, you need to put
some on, too,

00:49.215 --> 00:52.010
'fore you out here
lookin' like a strawberry.

00:52.093 --> 00:53.845
- Yeah, you right.
Gimme some of that.
- Yeah.

00:53.928 --> 00:56.389
Yo, this was a good idea.

00:56.473 --> 00:58.141
Folks straight-up
frolickin' out here.

00:58.224 --> 00:59.976
I, I didn't even
know we frolicked.

01:00.059 --> 01:02.103
Shit, I was
frolickin' yesterday.

01:02.187 --> 01:05.231
Ah, well, they frolickin'
on a empty stomach.

01:05.315 --> 01:07.609
Ah, Suge was
supposed to bring
the meat for the grill,

01:07.692 --> 01:08.943
and he still ain't here.

01:09.027 --> 01:10.987
Typical Suge.

01:11.070 --> 01:12.781
The princess is here.

01:12.864 --> 01:16.493
- Ayeee! What's up, girl?
- What's up, y'all?

01:16.576 --> 01:19.454
- Aric, I see you got
yo' boobs out today.

01:19.537 --> 01:21.623
-'Bout time you got here.
- What's the problem?

01:21.706 --> 01:23.374
It's not like
I was gonna help anyway.

01:23.458 --> 01:25.376
- You want sunscreen?
- What's this?

01:26.836 --> 01:28.588
This just
regular-ass Aveeno.

01:31.132 --> 01:33.426

01:40.141 --> 01:41.976
Girl, there's niggas
in bulk out here.

01:42.060 --> 01:43.812
It's like Costco.

01:43.895 --> 01:45.522
I don't know how
we gon' find this party.

01:45.605 --> 01:47.398
All the Blacks
had the same idea.

01:47.482 --> 01:48.650
Damn, we are a monolith.

01:48.733 --> 01:50.693
I think that might
be Nathan's group
over there.

01:50.777 --> 01:53.154
Niggas to the North
and the South?

01:53.238 --> 01:55.198
Girl, the options
is lookin' good, too.

01:55.281 --> 01:57.367
- Caught one bee on Bumble,

01:57.450 --> 01:59.202
- and the bitch is back.

01:59.285 --> 02:01.496
First of all,
I said the date was good.

02:01.579 --> 02:04.499
The sex...
I fuck weird now.

02:04.582 --> 02:07.252
I need to get more
reps in with somebody who
knows what they're doin'.

02:07.335 --> 02:09.546
Oh, someone who knows
what they're doin'?
That would be me.

02:09.629 --> 02:11.881
You know what?
I might be on my
spiritual shit,

02:11.965 --> 02:13.132
but I'm here
to support you.

02:13.216 --> 02:14.592
- And you.
- Ooh.

02:14.676 --> 02:16.010
Are we open
for business?

02:16.094 --> 02:17.428
Ahh!

02:17.512 --> 02:21.266
Okay, yes, Tag Team!
I love that for y'all.

02:21.349 --> 02:22.559
I'mma go try
to talk to Nathan,

02:22.642 --> 02:24.936
and not cry
in his mouth.

02:25.019 --> 02:27.355
Should ask him what
my tears taste like.

02:27.438 --> 02:29.315
- I know they salty.
Didn't he walk out

02:29.399 --> 02:31.025
on you in the middle
of the night?

02:31.109 --> 02:32.360
Like my Dad.

02:33.486 --> 02:36.322
Girl, it's been a week.
Still nothing?

02:36.406 --> 02:39.200
I mean, we texted,
but not about that.

02:39.284 --> 02:41.202
We both been
super busy, though.

02:41.286 --> 02:42.787
All right then,
maybe just like,

02:42.871 --> 02:44.372
ease into it.

02:44.455 --> 02:46.374
Take your time.

02:46.457 --> 02:48.418
- That's what I would do.
- Do y'all see this?

02:48.501 --> 02:50.753
I knew as soon as I announced

02:50.837 --> 02:52.213
this Nothing But Water deal

02:52.297 --> 02:53.256
he'd have some
shit to say.

02:53.339 --> 02:55.174
Don't even trip
off of him, okay?

02:55.258 --> 02:56.801
He can have all
the emoji fingers he wants,

02:56.885 --> 02:58.511
but his stuff sold out
because of who?

02:58.595 --> 03:02.181
Mm, that part.
Everybody wants to be
successful on Etsy,

03:02.265 --> 03:04.350
but not everybody's
ready for the fame.

03:04.434 --> 03:05.476
Y'all right.

03:05.560 --> 03:07.061
I ain't--
Let me stay
off this shit.

03:07.145 --> 03:08.313
I am not
about to argue
with someone

03:08.396 --> 03:10.231
who went
to Scared Straight
for high school.

03:11.733 --> 03:13.109
I didn't know
he went there, too.

03:14.277 --> 03:16.613
Man, I've tried
to get into juicin',

03:16.696 --> 03:18.489
but they say you
still can't juice meat.

03:19.324 --> 03:20.700
This--

03:20.783 --> 03:22.493
- Hey!
- Hey! Hey.

03:22.577 --> 03:24.662
- Thanks for comin'.
- Yeah, great. And you?

03:25.747 --> 03:27.582
You didn't ask.

03:27.665 --> 03:29.083
How are you doing?

03:29.167 --> 03:31.502
I'm just tryin'
to get my host on.

03:31.586 --> 03:32.629
That's dope.

03:32.712 --> 03:35.006
Every party needs a GHB.

03:35.089 --> 03:37.175
That's,
"Great Host Boiii."

03:37.258 --> 03:39.302
And this party's got you.

03:39.385 --> 03:41.387
Thanks.
- Killin' it since...

03:42.847 --> 03:45.308
before we got here.

03:45.391 --> 03:47.226
- Yeah, thanks.

03:47.310 --> 03:48.937
We would love some alcohol.

03:49.020 --> 03:50.813
I say, what's happenin'?
I'm Aric.

03:50.897 --> 03:51.940
I got y'all.

03:52.023 --> 03:53.274
I got, got drinks
right over here.

03:53.358 --> 03:54.359
- All right.
- Okay.

03:54.442 --> 03:55.526
Yeah.

03:57.111 --> 03:58.780
The weather turned
out great, right?

03:58.863 --> 04:00.490
What is it, like 74?

04:00.573 --> 04:03.785
Nah, it's probably,
like 81, actually.

04:03.868 --> 04:05.954
What you think it is?

04:06.037 --> 04:09.415
Oh, shit.
I should probably--

04:09.499 --> 04:11.334
- You good?
- Mm-hm.

04:16.839 --> 04:21.177
Excuse me, rainbow girl.
Can you throw it back?

04:21.260 --> 04:23.554
So, he's definitely
mad at me.

04:23.638 --> 04:25.306
He's bein' so weird, right?

04:25.390 --> 04:26.599
I mean, I don't know
his baseline.

04:26.683 --> 04:28.351
I always thought
he was a weird nigga.

04:28.434 --> 04:29.602
I thought that
was the draw.

04:29.686 --> 04:31.145
We should've
talked earlier.

04:31.229 --> 04:33.648
- Maybe I shouldn't have come.
- You want us to leave?

04:33.731 --> 04:36.025
- And make things more weird?
- It might not be to him.

04:36.109 --> 04:38.778
But then again,
I don't know his baseline.

04:38.861 --> 04:40.321
Wait, Kelli,
you're drinkin'?

04:40.405 --> 04:42.156
No! Booze is on snooze

04:42.240 --> 04:43.366
until a bitch
is enlightened.

04:43.449 --> 04:45.618
This is for you.

04:45.702 --> 04:47.078
Loosen up.

04:47.912 --> 04:49.747
You right, thanks.

04:51.749 --> 04:54.544
Is Aric swipe right
or swipe left?

04:54.627 --> 04:55.878
Well, let's not
choose just yet.

04:55.962 --> 04:57.255
Everybody's still
in the runnin'

04:57.338 --> 04:59.549
until they
disqualify themselves.

04:59.632 --> 05:01.884
- Yes!
- Hoo-hoo! She back!

05:01.968 --> 05:03.386
Yo! Who tryin'
to get busy

05:03.469 --> 05:05.304
on the Spades table, though?

05:05.388 --> 05:08.307
Oh, Spades!

05:08.391 --> 05:10.601
Wait, is that like Pitty Pat?
I'll play if y'all teach me.

05:10.685 --> 05:15.815
The cut-off is 16.
Ain't nobody teachin' you
Spades at your big age.

05:15.898 --> 05:17.358
They said
I can't play.

05:17.442 --> 05:20.028
- Guys against girls.
- Let's go.

05:24.741 --> 05:29.495
<i>♪ Didn't wanna eat it,

05:29.579 --> 05:32.040

05:36.878 --> 05:39.338
I mean, I'm just,
I'm just, I'm ju--
Ahh! Bam!

05:39.422 --> 05:42.050
Ahh!

05:42.133 --> 05:43.426
We gon' take those.

05:43.509 --> 05:45.219
Oh, I am gonna
take those.

05:47.722 --> 05:50.266
You know what?
You gon' go 'head
and call us the librarians.

05:50.349 --> 05:52.143
Why?
'Cause we got books!

05:52.226 --> 05:54.020
- Read 'em!

05:57.356 --> 05:58.566
They fuckin'.

06:01.652 --> 06:04.322
Oh, no.
They not fuckin'.

06:09.243 --> 06:11.412
But they fuckin'.

06:16.000 --> 06:18.211
Y'all lucky y'all
not some niggas,
'cause these size 14s

06:18.294 --> 06:19.712
would be all up in yo' ass.

06:19.796 --> 06:22.715
Mmm, size 14s, huh?

06:22.799 --> 06:25.593
- Noted.
- Aric, what your feet
be lookin' like?

06:25.676 --> 06:27.553
Probably drier than a bitch.

06:27.637 --> 06:29.806
Barbers be the ashiest ones.

06:29.889 --> 06:32.558
Damn, why you
comin' for me?

06:32.642 --> 06:34.644
Don't worry 'bout it, baby.
I got cocoa butter.

06:34.727 --> 06:36.104
I wear a size nine.

06:36.187 --> 06:37.271
Why you proud of that?

06:37.355 --> 06:38.940
Also, round up,
nigga, round up

06:39.023 --> 06:40.775
in public, shit!

06:42.110 --> 06:45.196
Is that Issa?
Hey, Issa!

06:47.532 --> 06:49.617
Resha! Hey!

06:49.700 --> 06:51.619
- You look so good.
- Oh, you too!

06:51.702 --> 06:53.204
I almost didn't recognize you

06:53.287 --> 06:55.581
outside of your smock.

06:55.665 --> 06:57.583
You think the water
looks cool?
It looks hella cold.

06:57.667 --> 06:59.460
It looks real warm to me.

06:59.544 --> 07:01.712
Say less.
Y'all comin'?

07:02.672 --> 07:05.216
Go! Woo!

07:07.176 --> 07:10.930
I bet she doesn't even
have to learn how
to swim with those.

07:11.013 --> 07:12.390
She could just float.

07:13.266 --> 07:14.725
That's Resha.

07:17.019 --> 07:19.772
So, I just wanted
to check in.

07:19.856 --> 07:21.357
Are we cool?

07:23.860 --> 07:25.695
Nothin's changed for me.

07:26.654 --> 07:28.614
Okay...

07:28.698 --> 07:30.575
so we're still friends?

07:32.493 --> 07:33.828
Yep.

07:35.746 --> 07:37.790
Aye, the wait is over!

07:38.916 --> 07:40.418
Ah, shit.

07:40.501 --> 07:43.254
Man, what happened
to the burgers

07:43.337 --> 07:44.964
and the hot dogs you
was supposed to bring?

07:45.047 --> 07:47.550
- I got all this mustard.
- I said I was bringin' food.

07:47.633 --> 07:49.635
I ain't say nothin'
about no barbecue.

07:49.719 --> 07:51.971
Now take this Domino's,
Nathaniel.

07:57.435 --> 07:59.353
Oh, this a big one!

08:00.438 --> 08:02.148
- You okay?
- Yeah, you?

08:02.231 --> 08:03.441
I'm okay, too.

08:03.524 --> 08:07.361
We made it.
We're bonded for life now.

08:07.445 --> 08:08.946
Why the fuck would
you drop the pizza?

08:09.030 --> 08:11.407
- It was a earthquake.
- What's that gotta
do with your hands?

08:11.490 --> 08:14.035
- Yo, relax.
<i>Please evacuate the beach.</i>

08:14.118 --> 08:16.204
<i>We're shutting down
in case of a tsunami.</i>

08:16.287 --> 08:17.997
- Are you serious?
- Tsunami?

08:18.080 --> 08:20.082
I can't be
in another
tsunami, y'all.

08:20.166 --> 08:21.500
I basically died.

08:21.584 --> 08:22.752
<i>I repeat, please</i>

08:22.835 --> 08:24.712
<i>-evacuate the beach.</i>
- I did, too.

08:24.795 --> 08:27.131
Fuck a tsunami.
I'm just gettin' started.

08:33.679 --> 08:36.098
Hold up, y'all! Y'all!

08:36.182 --> 08:40.102
Let's hit a bar nearby!
Drinks on the shop!

08:40.186 --> 08:41.437
Y'all wanna go
somewhere else?

08:41.520 --> 08:43.022
'Cause we don't have
to go with them.

08:43.105 --> 08:44.106
Um...

08:45.650 --> 08:46.943
I'm still narrowin'
it down.

08:47.026 --> 08:49.487
These niggas
is neck-and-neck
to see me nekked.

08:51.322 --> 08:52.782
- Let's go.
- Okay.

08:52.865 --> 08:54.200
<i>Please evacuate the beach.</i>

08:54.283 --> 08:56.661
<i>We're shutting down
in case of a tsunami.</i>

09:00.915 --> 09:02.750
Hey, real talk,
I think I sensed that

09:02.833 --> 09:04.126
earthquake before it hit.

09:04.210 --> 09:05.795
I mean, I got chills,

09:05.878 --> 09:08.673
- and then, five
minutes later, boom.

09:08.756 --> 09:11.801
Oh, shit.
Aye, you at lot 10 right now?

09:11.884 --> 09:14.178
Yeah, we had to leave 'cause...

09:14.262 --> 09:16.931
yeah... yeah,
that's my bad, man.

09:17.014 --> 09:20.393
We rollin' to Sharkeez, though.
You should come through.

09:21.560 --> 09:23.688
Aight, bet.

09:23.771 --> 09:26.732
Hey, Nate,
you think your girl's
homegirl was feelin' me?

09:26.816 --> 09:28.859
Maybe. Ain't Johnny
tryin' to get at her?

09:28.943 --> 09:30.444
Man, she wasn't
staring at Johnny.

09:30.528 --> 09:34.740
Them big, sexy eyes
talkin' all that shit
with them sexy lips.

09:34.824 --> 09:37.952
Damn. Wouldn't it
be a trip if I started
datin' your girl's girl?

09:38.035 --> 09:39.203
Not my girl.

09:39.287 --> 09:41.539
- She all over the place.
- What you mean?

09:41.622 --> 09:44.417
She basically called
me over last week...

09:44.500 --> 09:45.584
to cuddle.

09:45.668 --> 09:47.044
Did somebody die?

09:47.128 --> 09:48.713
Shit, I don't know.

09:48.796 --> 09:51.215
We been friends over
the last year because

09:51.299 --> 09:54.135
that's what she wanted,
and then, she pulled this shit.

09:54.218 --> 09:55.511
Then she
show up today,

09:55.594 --> 09:57.096
legs all out,
all oiled up,

09:57.179 --> 09:59.056
talkin' about,
"We still friends?"

09:59.140 --> 10:01.142
Women always quick
to friendzone you,

10:01.225 --> 10:04.228
and then, want you to spoon
'em like y'all been fuckin',
but you haven't.

10:04.312 --> 10:06.814
Exactly! Haven't!

10:06.897 --> 10:09.025
And then, she started crying.

10:09.108 --> 10:11.193
- Wait, what?
- So, somebody did die.

10:11.277 --> 10:12.820
I didn't wanna do
that shit all night,

10:12.903 --> 10:14.155
so I bounced.

10:14.238 --> 10:15.656
Man, there must be
a reason she felt

10:15.740 --> 10:17.908
comfortable cryin' on you.

10:17.992 --> 10:20.036
- What you mean?
- You do have that,

10:20.119 --> 10:23.539
"Let me cry
on your shoulder"
energy.

10:23.622 --> 10:26.375
You let her
friendzone you, bro.

10:27.793 --> 10:30.338
Man, she don't know
what she want.

10:30.421 --> 10:33.215
Bruh, she is rollin'
to the next spot.

10:33.299 --> 10:34.258
She wants somethin'.

10:34.342 --> 10:36.761
And, trust me,
it ain't no haircut.

10:36.844 --> 10:37.720
Facts.

10:37.803 --> 10:39.180
Aye, I can't
wait to shake

10:39.263 --> 10:40.806
Molly's fine ass up.

10:40.890 --> 10:42.558
Hit it from the back.
Spin her around.

10:42.641 --> 10:44.935
Give her a little part.

10:45.019 --> 10:48.481
Get that scalp wet.
Slap that neck.

10:48.564 --> 10:50.191
Aight, okay.

10:50.274 --> 10:52.443

That was no earthquake.

10:59.950 --> 11:03.704
See, the government's
tryin' to test out

11:03.788 --> 11:06.665
Right! But like,
when the Earth was shakin'...

11:06.749 --> 11:08.250
I was already shook.

11:09.335 --> 11:12.254
Are you fuckin' kiddin' me?

11:12.338 --> 11:16.133
Oh, girl, I am so hot
right now, I'm leakin'.

11:16.217 --> 11:17.635
I had to step outside.

11:17.718 --> 11:20.513
Right? Like, what the fuck?
Now I'm a fraud?

11:20.596 --> 11:22.598
You know this nigga
was born in the Valley.

11:22.681 --> 11:25.476
Suburbia niggas.
So, what you want me to do?

11:25.559 --> 11:27.895
You know I can buzz down on him.
I'm in the hive.

11:27.978 --> 11:29.563
You know what?
Don't even worry about it.

11:29.647 --> 11:30.981
We good over here, baby.

11:31.065 --> 11:33.776
We on salary now,
we gettin' money.

11:33.859 --> 11:34.777
<i>Girl, you right.</i>

11:34.860 --> 11:35.694
But you let me know

11:35.778 --> 11:37.196
if you wanna start trippin'.

11:37.279 --> 11:39.198
My bags stay packed--
Oh.

11:39.281 --> 11:40.491
Oh, shit.

11:40.574 --> 11:42.743
<i>Okay, bye.</i>

11:42.827 --> 11:44.662
That's why I buy a new
phone every other week.

11:44.745 --> 11:48.707
Switch it up.
Shock the system.
Stay off the grid.

11:48.791 --> 11:50.376
I call it
the three S's.

11:52.253 --> 11:54.505
I wish the fourth S
was "silence."

11:55.714 --> 11:57.758
I know I didn't
really die,

11:57.842 --> 11:59.635
but it still made me
wanna look inward.

11:59.718 --> 12:00.970
And then, you know
what I found out?

12:01.053 --> 12:02.555
I got a lotta shit
goin' on inside.

12:02.638 --> 12:04.223
- Ain't that part of the journey?
Mm-hm.

12:04.306 --> 12:05.349
It's like, at the end
of the day,

12:05.433 --> 12:06.600
don't we all just
wanna be okay?

12:06.684 --> 12:08.144
You know what?
Those are good questions.

12:08.227 --> 12:08.978
Oh, shit.

12:09.061 --> 12:10.729
I got a podcast
about questions.

12:10.813 --> 12:11.814
You tryna be a guest?

12:11.897 --> 12:13.441
Ooh, I love
existential shit.

12:13.524 --> 12:15.943
Girl, I minored
in philosophy
before beauty school,

12:16.026 --> 12:18.446
so I stay askin' questions
and turnin' over stones.

12:18.529 --> 12:20.114
- Even heavy ones.
Oh, shit, honey.

12:20.197 --> 12:23.367
My papa was
a rollin' stone.
I gotta unpack that.

12:28.164 --> 12:29.582
Hey, Resha.
Quick question.

12:29.665 --> 12:31.625
What's up?
- You fuckin' Nathan?

12:31.709 --> 12:34.587
What? Girl, no.
That's like my brother.

12:34.670 --> 12:35.671
My blood.

12:35.754 --> 12:37.006
But I bet he
could fuck good.

12:37.089 --> 12:38.841
Are you tryin' to smash?
'Cause I could set that up.

12:38.924 --> 12:40.593
I'll circle back
if I need you.

12:40.676 --> 12:42.720
- Sounds good.
So, anyway, like

12:42.803 --> 12:44.513
when my neighbor's
cat died,

12:44.597 --> 12:46.098
it was like it,
it was mine.

12:46.182 --> 12:47.391
- You know what I mean?
I feel you.

12:47.475 --> 12:48.934
And I still see his ghost.

12:49.018 --> 12:50.603
That's so deep.
You know what
I'm sayin'?

12:50.686 --> 12:51.854
And I'm just like,
what does that mean?

12:51.937 --> 12:52.980
If your pussy a ghost,

12:53.063 --> 12:55.149
- is my pussy a ghost?
Wow.

12:55.232 --> 12:57.651
Like, put that together.
You know what I mean?

12:57.735 --> 12:58.777

14:05.761 --> 14:09.265
- Nah--

leave me like that?

14:09.932 --> 14:12.393

14:13.686 --> 14:17.356
I mean, the taco trucks

What'd you want
me to do, Iss?

14:24.738 --> 14:28.534
I guess I just expected you

14:30.202 --> 14:34.373
I ain't know we
had expectations
for each other.

14:39.795 --> 14:42.006
I probably shouldn't
have kissed you.

14:42.089 --> 14:43.382
That was my bad.

14:44.508 --> 14:45.884
No, no.
It's, it's my fault.

14:45.968 --> 14:49.221
Uh, 'cause I shouldn't have
asked you to spend the night.

14:49.305 --> 14:50.764

14:53.642 --> 14:55.394

15:11.452 --> 15:12.911

15:14.163 --> 15:15.164

15:34.266 --> 15:35.601
- Yeah.

15:35.684 --> 15:38.228
Might end up on the back
of a milk carton.

15:38.312 --> 15:40.022
That's funny.

15:40.105 --> 15:42.316

15:51.158 --> 15:52.493
How did I not

15:52.576 --> 15:55.329
Yeah, man, I, I stayed
with them for a minute,

15:55.412 --> 15:58.165
before I moved in
with Andrew.

15:58.248 --> 16:00.834
How about we catch up
to y'all with them shots?

16:10.094 --> 16:12.721
Houston people
really claim
Paul Wall like that?

16:12.805 --> 16:14.765
Hell yeah, we used
to see Chamillionare

16:14.848 --> 16:16.225
and him at the club
all the time.

16:16.308 --> 16:18.852
Yo, remember when
we drove to South By
to see them?

16:18.936 --> 16:21.438
And that one nigga
sold us them t-shirts,
but they said--

16:21.522 --> 16:23.982
"Calamari-onaire."

16:24.066 --> 16:25.818
That sounds delicious.

16:25.901 --> 16:28.153
Every-fuckin'-body
was at that party.

16:28.237 --> 16:30.864
There was like
after-parties
in the parkin' lot.

16:30.948 --> 16:33.826
- Wow!
- That was my whole
college soundtrack.

16:33.909 --> 16:36.036
I even got a grill
'cause of them,
but it didn't fit,

16:36.120 --> 16:38.455
so I kind of just
had to suck on it.

16:38.539 --> 16:41.041
- Anyway, I know y'all had fun.
- We did...

16:41.125 --> 16:43.085
until Nathan
abandoned my ass.

16:43.168 --> 16:47.005
Oh, shit. Here he go.
I done apologized for this
so many times.

16:47.089 --> 16:49.800
- Wait, what happened?
- This nigga just
ran off into the night.

16:49.883 --> 16:51.844
He swore he was gonna
be their tour manager.

16:51.927 --> 16:54.930
- I had to hitchhike home.
- Yeah, that sound like Nathan.

16:55.013 --> 16:56.265
He be gone
with the wind,

16:56.348 --> 16:57.808
like a little
light-skin leaf.

16:57.891 --> 17:00.769
- Ooh.
- You do be wearin' leaf colors.

17:00.853 --> 17:03.439
Look at him!
About to blow away.

17:07.609 --> 17:10.028
Well, I'm so glad
the wind blew him my way,

17:10.112 --> 17:11.864
'cause I used to be
all over the place,

17:11.947 --> 17:15.159
but he inspired me
to put down roots.

17:15.242 --> 17:18.537
Turn me into a whole tree.

17:18.620 --> 17:20.497
'Cause you had said leaf--
I was buildin'--

17:20.581 --> 17:22.332
- It was an analogy--
- We got it.

17:22.416 --> 17:25.836
Ah, shit.

But you should come through.
Mr. Jingles is cool.

18:31.985 --> 18:34.780
Kelli
I had this dream,
and my Mom was in it,

18:34.863 --> 18:37.407
and she was a hamster
on a wheel, right?

18:37.491 --> 18:40.202
And I ain't have no food,
so I ate her.

18:40.285 --> 18:41.328
So what does that mean?

18:41.411 --> 18:43.330
You know,
like my past
is inside of me.

18:43.413 --> 18:45.040
I don't know.

18:48.919 --> 18:50.254
No!
That's what I'm sayin'.

18:50.337 --> 18:51.672

18:51.755 --> 18:54.800
Nah, nah, nah.
You never, ever
beat me, bruh.

18:54.883 --> 18:56.760
What?!
I was givin'
you the business

18:56.844 --> 18:57.970
on the court
every time.

18:58.053 --> 19:00.097
You mean the summer
I broke my shootin' arm?

19:00.180 --> 19:01.306
I was shootin'
with my off hand!

19:01.390 --> 19:03.141
Man, both your
hands been off.

19:05.310 --> 19:08.355
Nah, I'm, I'm glad
we here kickin' it
again, man.

19:08.438 --> 19:10.482
Finally.
Been a minute since

19:10.566 --> 19:11.984
I felt like
this was home.

19:12.067 --> 19:13.360
Yeah, it's been too long.

19:13.443 --> 19:15.696
Yeah.

19:24.997 --> 19:26.248
You dribble
with both hands.

19:26.331 --> 19:27.791
You always
double dribble.

19:27.875 --> 19:30.711
Nathan
I dribble with both hands.

19:32.379 --> 19:34.590
You got tattoos?

19:34.673 --> 19:37.092
Okay, so what's
this one mean?

19:37.175 --> 19:39.386
The Chinese symbol
for good dick.

19:40.137 --> 19:43.015
Oh, okay.

19:52.024 --> 19:53.150
Fuck!

19:54.985 --> 19:57.613
Fuck, I love this song.

20:00.157 --> 20:02.117
I don't know the words,
but...

20:04.828 --> 20:07.372
<i>♪ She got around, now she's
fuckin' the whole squad ♪</i>

20:07.456 --> 20:11.168
<i>♪ That pussy lookin' like
the sign of the cross on God ♪</i>

20:11.251 --> 20:14.588
<i>♪ Leanin' to the side,
it's spillin' water ♪</i>

20:14.671 --> 20:16.506
<i>♪ Smashed, then passed ♪</i>

20:16.590 --> 20:19.635
<i>♪ Fuck niggas, always
tryna take my shit ♪</i>

20:19.718 --> 20:22.387
Look, I know you said not
to bring people, man, but...

20:24.765 --> 20:26.475
I brought people.

20:26.558 --> 20:27.601
Is this gonna
be a problem?

20:27.684 --> 20:30.270
I ain't never been
no problem, baby.

20:30.354 --> 20:32.564
Bruh, bruh, bruh.

20:33.398 --> 20:34.775
Hey, gimme one sec.

20:39.196 --> 20:41.531
- He's workin' on it.
- He better work faster.

20:41.615 --> 20:42.950
That's Derulo
in there.

20:43.033 --> 20:44.993
I'm tryna fight,
tryna tussle.

20:45.077 --> 20:47.162
Yo, this is
Hollywood as shit.
We ain't gon' get in.

20:47.245 --> 20:48.664
Aric know everybody.

20:48.747 --> 20:49.915
We gettin' in, all right?

20:55.337 --> 20:56.797
Girl, you good?

20:56.880 --> 20:58.131
Yeah, just some work shit.

20:58.215 --> 20:59.925
No big deal.
I handled it.

21:00.008 --> 21:01.426
Oh, okay.

21:01.510 --> 21:06.181
Hey, listen, so,
I think Aric and I
are a match, so...

21:06.264 --> 21:09.685
- should I fuck him?
If you want to.

21:09.768 --> 21:11.061
What that nani say?

21:12.104 --> 21:13.355
"It's a yes from me, dawg."

21:14.898 --> 21:16.733
- Oh, here he come.
Ooh.

21:16.817 --> 21:19.987
- Aye, yo, the party's
at capacity.
- No!

21:20.070 --> 21:23.365
And I can only get
one person in, so...

21:24.616 --> 21:27.577
- Molly.
Oh.

21:27.661 --> 21:30.539
Um, I'll try and sneak
you in from the back.

21:30.622 --> 21:32.499
- Girl, I'll text you.
- Okay.

21:33.542 --> 21:36.378
<i>Jason Derulo.</i>

21:48.140 --> 21:49.850
Girl, I can't believe
we've been standin'
in this line

21:49.933 --> 21:51.309
for over an hour.

21:51.393 --> 21:53.603
And my camel toe
is kickin'.

21:55.439 --> 21:58.442
How y'all feelin'?
I mean, if this
don't work out,

21:58.525 --> 22:00.110
I heard Sharkeez
still poppin'.

22:00.193 --> 22:02.029
Wait, Molly
found a door.

22:02.112 --> 22:04.031
She said come around back,
but hurry because Jason

22:04.114 --> 22:05.615
just started doin'
close-up magic.

22:05.699 --> 22:08.285
Oh, I sure as shit
ain't missin' that.

22:08.368 --> 22:12.247
Wait, Moe! Moe!

22:16.334 --> 22:17.502
Thomas!

22:18.462 --> 22:19.755
Thomas!

22:19.838 --> 22:22.090
- You comin'?
- I think I'mma head home.

22:22.174 --> 22:23.925
My Lyft will be here
in a few minutes.

22:24.009 --> 22:26.094
Lyft?
When you order a Lyft?

22:26.178 --> 22:29.014
When your boy
started tearin' up
over not gettin' in.

22:31.725 --> 22:34.269
Well, I mean,
I ain't gonna abandon you.

22:34.352 --> 22:35.771
If that's what
you're worried about.

22:35.854 --> 22:37.689
No, man.
I'm old now.

22:37.773 --> 22:39.733
I don't have
your energy.

22:39.816 --> 22:42.944
Aight.
I know Velma got you
on a tight leash.

22:43.028 --> 22:44.362
Nah, she wanted
me to come out.

22:44.446 --> 22:46.656
- She happy we hangin' again.
- You ain't gotta cover for her.

22:46.740 --> 22:49.910
- I know she don't fuck with me.
- No, Velma loves you, man.

22:49.993 --> 22:51.745
That's why she
kicked me out?

22:51.828 --> 22:54.331
- No place to go.
- Come on, man.

22:54.956 --> 22:56.333
I'm lyin'?

22:57.751 --> 22:59.961
That wasn't on Velma.

23:00.045 --> 23:01.296
What you mean?

23:01.379 --> 23:02.798
Look, we don't have
to get into this tonight.

23:02.881 --> 23:04.549
Nah, I mean,
we in it, bro.

23:07.677 --> 23:09.137
To be honest...

23:09.221 --> 23:12.766
I'm the one who
didn't feel comfortable
havin' you around.

23:12.849 --> 23:15.143
I mean, you showed up
with practically no warnin'.

23:15.227 --> 23:16.812
Then you'd be gone
for days on end,

23:16.895 --> 23:18.605
or come home
in the middle
of the night.

23:18.688 --> 23:20.607
You'd leave
the door unlocked.

23:20.690 --> 23:22.984
I got kids, man.

23:23.068 --> 23:25.362
That ain't me
no more, man.

23:26.530 --> 23:28.949
I'm sorry...

23:29.032 --> 23:32.285
I'm sorry I didn't
tell you straight-up.
I just...

23:32.369 --> 23:34.830
didn't really know
how to handle it,
or what to say.

23:34.913 --> 23:38.458
And Velma thought
it'd be easier if we
just put it on her.

23:41.336 --> 23:44.256
I gotta go.
We should keep talkin'.

23:44.339 --> 23:46.383
I'll call you, okay?

23:58.103 --> 23:59.020
Oh, he left?

23:59.104 --> 24:00.522
Well, Molly's
gettin' us in.

24:00.605 --> 24:03.859
Oh, Moe's inside
already, obviously.

24:05.110 --> 24:08.405
Uh, yeah, I need a minute.

24:08.488 --> 24:11.324
Oh... okay.

24:35.891 --> 24:37.392
You okay?

24:44.149 --> 24:49.070
I was manic when
I lived with them.

24:49.154 --> 24:50.989
And I ain't know it
at the time.

24:53.116 --> 24:54.701
And you haven't
told him yet?

24:56.286 --> 24:59.372
Nah, I ain't
talked to them
since I moved out.

25:00.707 --> 25:05.962
I just wanted him to see
I got my life together.

25:10.842 --> 25:12.552
But fuck it.

25:12.636 --> 25:14.679
Can't change how
nobody see me.

25:16.973 --> 25:18.391
Yeah.

25:19.351 --> 25:21.353
I get that.

25:23.480 --> 25:26.358
Can't change how
you see me either.

25:26.983 --> 25:29.027
What? Me?

25:32.405 --> 25:34.282
Me crying wasn't about you.

25:34.366 --> 25:37.244
It caught me off guard, too.

25:41.122 --> 25:43.333
I guess I was
just overwhelmed.

25:44.501 --> 25:48.380
Last year was
a lot for me.

25:51.508 --> 25:55.387
And now, I feel like
I'm just always waiting
for the other shoe to drop.

26:01.059 --> 26:03.395
I'm scared to get my hopes up.

26:04.229 --> 26:05.563
And I...

26:06.815 --> 26:08.608
I know I've been
afraid to admit it

26:08.692 --> 26:11.319
because I don't wanna
look stupid, but...

26:13.571 --> 26:16.324
I don't wanna just
be friends with you.

26:21.037 --> 26:23.331
I don't wanna be friends
with you either.

26:42.559 --> 26:46.396
- You felt that?
- Yeah, I felt that.
