WEBVTT

02:27.481 --> 02:28.683
Shh.

02:29.584 --> 02:31.318
We're in the Bay of Silence.

02:31.351 --> 02:33.387
Oh, that's right.

02:44.966 --> 02:48.770
Now, my child,
what is your confession?

02:48.803 --> 02:50.738
I lied yesterday.

02:50.772 --> 02:54.509
I see. Do you often lie,
my child?

02:55.576 --> 02:58.579
If I say no,
will you believe me?

02:58.613 --> 02:59.947
Yes, absolutely.

03:02.650 --> 03:05.620
And what is your confession,
my boy?

03:05.653 --> 03:08.288
Well, I have been having
these impure thoughts

03:08.321 --> 03:10.357
about a woman.

03:11.759 --> 03:14.294
A very fascinating widow.

03:14.896 --> 03:16.396
A famous artist.

03:16.964 --> 03:18.465
How impure?

03:48.295 --> 03:49.831
I wanna live here one day.

03:51.331 --> 03:52.900
- We'll fix it up.
- Mmm.

03:52.934 --> 03:54.669
Well, I can fix up anything.

03:54.702 --> 03:58.906
Um, old bicycles,
broken hearts, anything.

04:00.975 --> 04:03.978
Do you know what they call
this in French?

04:04.011 --> 04:05.780
<i>Moule.</i>

04:05.813 --> 04:07.615
But you know what it means?

04:07.648 --> 04:09.282
Mussel. A mussel.
It's a mussel.

04:09.316 --> 04:11.552
Mm, what else does it mean?

04:11.586 --> 04:14.822
- No idea. No, no, no, no.
- Yeah.

04:14.856 --> 04:16.423
- Really?
- <i>C'est la moule.</i>

04:16.456 --> 04:19.060
- Can I have it?
- That's my moule!

04:19.093 --> 04:21.461
I know. Now it's mine.

04:21.495 --> 04:23.931
You ate my moule!

05:01.869 --> 05:03.838
- Please don't.
- Sorry.

05:06.808 --> 05:08.408
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

05:09.476 --> 05:10.678
I'm fine.

05:16.717 --> 05:17.718
Ah.

05:36.671 --> 05:37.705
Will?

05:41.509 --> 05:42.577
Will?

05:48.783 --> 05:49.784
Will?

05:50.218 --> 05:51.451
Will!

05:51.484 --> 05:52.620
Argh!

05:53.154 --> 05:54.421
Ah!

05:55.623 --> 05:57.658
- Don't do that.
- I... I'm sorry!

05:57.692 --> 05:59.627
- Don't do it.
- I didn't mean to scare you.

06:01.529 --> 06:03.798
Please...
gimme your hand.

06:09.203 --> 06:10.972
Please, say yes.

06:12.907 --> 06:15.442
Have to consult the twins.

06:15.475 --> 06:17.410
We'll get
a proper one later. Okay?

06:42.737 --> 06:43.738
Come on.

06:43.771 --> 06:46.040
What? No! Oh, my God,
you'll break your back!

06:46.073 --> 06:47.842
But we need
to do this right.

06:47.875 --> 06:49.543
But I'm so heavy.

06:49.577 --> 06:51.746
No, you're not!
I'm strong for God sakes.

06:51.779 --> 06:53.681
Look!

06:55.448 --> 06:56.951
Here we are.

06:59.787 --> 07:01.856
My God. Look at this!

07:01.889 --> 07:03.057
Can you work here?

07:03.090 --> 07:04.091
Yeah.

07:05.893 --> 07:07.061
Come... Come.

07:07.094 --> 07:08.529
Yeah, yeah.

07:11.065 --> 07:12.099
Ow...

07:12.133 --> 07:13.834
Oh, are you okay?

07:13.868 --> 07:16.237
- All right?
- It's okay, it's just a twinge.

07:16.270 --> 07:17.571
Ooh.

07:17.605 --> 07:19.206
Mummy! Mummy!

07:21.676 --> 07:24.011
Mummy! Mummy!

07:24.045 --> 07:25.478
Wait, will ya?

07:26.113 --> 07:27.949
Candy kept saying fuck.

07:27.982 --> 07:29.216
Because we got lost.

07:29.250 --> 07:31.819
Yeah, well the GPS
said to drive into the canal.

07:33.220 --> 07:35.488
Fuck me it's big!

07:36.657 --> 07:38.025
You wanna go
check out the kitchen?

07:38.059 --> 07:39.560
You mean,
shall I make some tea?

07:39.593 --> 07:40.761
Yes, come on.

07:40.795 --> 07:41.829
- Hey, girls.
- Hi, Will.

07:41.862 --> 07:43.064
- Hi, Will.
- Hi Candy.

07:44.265 --> 07:46.567
Oh, my gosh,
it's huge!

07:51.706 --> 07:53.741
This is so nice.

07:53.774 --> 07:54.976
It's heaven.

07:56.777 --> 07:58.079
I'll check out the bath.

08:01.649 --> 08:02.950
There's no milk!

08:04.085 --> 08:06.520
- Let's bury Will!
- Yeah, let's.

08:06.554 --> 08:07.955
No.

08:07.989 --> 08:10.024
- Lie down, Will.
- No!

08:11.258 --> 08:13.493
Oh, no, not in my ear!

08:15.663 --> 08:18.132
Do you think Mummy'll have
twins like us?

08:18.165 --> 08:20.968
- We want a baby each, so it'll be fair.
- Oh, do you?

08:21.402 --> 08:22.837
Baby each!

08:22.870 --> 08:26.007
Baby each! Baby each!

08:27.808 --> 08:30.011
Baby each! Baby each!

08:30.044 --> 08:32.513
Hey, Will!
Lift your head up.

08:37.084 --> 08:39.120
Hey, Ros, careful.

08:39.153 --> 08:41.655
Careful!
No, Ros, no!

08:53.968 --> 08:56.303
- What's happening?
- Excuse me.

08:56.337 --> 08:57.605
Will.

08:57.638 --> 09:00.041
Drift you off to sleep now.

09:02.209 --> 09:03.644
What's wrong?

09:05.312 --> 09:08.082
- Suction...
- More suction.

09:10.684 --> 09:12.286
- What's wrong?
- You need to leave now.

09:12.319 --> 09:13.921
Tell me what's wrong,
please?

09:30.938 --> 09:32.273
He's a lucky lad.

09:33.874 --> 09:36.043
Had quite a shock
with that fall.

09:36.077 --> 09:38.712
Didn't expect to be born
so soon, did he?

09:47.188 --> 09:49.223
He's sleeping.

09:49.256 --> 09:50.825
And he's beautiful.

09:52.426 --> 09:53.994
Where is the other one?

09:54.829 --> 09:56.897
I had twins, didn't I?

09:57.665 --> 09:58.899
One died.

09:58.933 --> 10:01.735
No! No, no, no, no, darling.

10:01.769 --> 10:04.305
Just one beautiful boy.
And he needed help breathing,

10:04.338 --> 10:06.340
- but he's very much alive.
- No.

10:06.373 --> 10:09.110
No. I had twins again,
I saw.

10:10.244 --> 10:11.745
They took him out?

10:11.779 --> 10:13.781
Hey. Let it heal.
Let it heal.

10:17.785 --> 10:19.954
You let them take my baby?

10:22.289 --> 10:23.657
Try... Try and
get some rest.

10:23.691 --> 10:24.992
Try and sleep,
Ros, okay?

10:25.025 --> 10:27.361
Why did you let them
take my baby?

10:46.147 --> 10:47.948
Why didn't you
just name him Jesus?

10:47.982 --> 10:49.283
It's not religious, Mum.

10:49.316 --> 10:51.418
Amadeo means
"loved by God".

10:51.452 --> 10:53.254
He needed all the help
he could get.

10:53.287 --> 10:55.356
And it's Italian.
Thought you'd like it.

10:55.389 --> 10:58.192
Vivian, with that name he can play
for any European football team.

10:58.225 --> 11:01.428
It's just our family has always
had such normal names.

11:01.462 --> 11:03.464
Johnny, Tommy, Bertie.

11:03.497 --> 11:05.833
Oh, yeah.
Really normal.

11:06.734 --> 11:08.335
You look tired.

11:08.369 --> 11:09.737
Everything all right?

11:09.770 --> 11:10.871
I'm fine.

11:12.072 --> 11:14.808
Ah, Raul!

11:14.842 --> 11:16.911
He's an ex-matador.
Raul...

11:16.944 --> 11:18.179
- You okay, honey?
- I'm good.

11:18.212 --> 11:19.346
- Fine?
- Yeah.

11:19.380 --> 11:20.481
Take him for a bit.

11:20.515 --> 11:22.183
Hello, my darling.

11:26.787 --> 11:27.988
Hi, Marcia.

11:28.022 --> 11:30.090
- Fancy party.
- Fancy wife.

11:31.258 --> 11:32.293
And that's Will's boss.

11:32.326 --> 11:33.961
- Hey.
- Hey.

11:33.994 --> 11:35.095
So, did you bring...

11:35.129 --> 11:37.298
No, no.
Let's not go there.

11:37.331 --> 11:38.165
There you are!

11:38.199 --> 11:41.001
Oh, is Vivian's ex
still managing Ros?

11:41.035 --> 11:42.336
Yeah, they're cool.

11:42.369 --> 11:43.370
Mm.

11:46.040 --> 11:47.942
Rosalind, my darling.

11:47.975 --> 11:49.710
More radiant than ever.

11:51.212 --> 11:52.446
So...

11:52.479 --> 11:54.748
When do I get
my percentage?

11:54.782 --> 11:55.916
Sorry?

11:55.950 --> 11:59.220
Well, 10% of you, my darling,
means 5% of this bubala.

11:59.253 --> 12:01.422
Milton, you might have
to run that by me.

12:02.557 --> 12:04.959
Happy to negotiate. Ooh...

12:04.992 --> 12:06.460
Let me
take him, honey.

12:06.493 --> 12:08.128
Here.

12:11.999 --> 12:13.167
Open the box.

12:16.370 --> 12:19.073
Oh, my God!

12:19.106 --> 12:21.775
Milton, I think he would have
been happier with a rattle.

12:23.877 --> 12:27.147
Now, this is my bit.

12:28.148 --> 12:30.384
Right... here.

12:30.417 --> 12:32.086
You're spoiling her, Milton.

12:32.119 --> 12:33.254
Oh, well.

12:38.025 --> 12:39.493
- I'm so sorry.
- Milton!

12:39.527 --> 12:41.228
Just go upstairs
and get a T-shirt.

12:42.896 --> 12:44.131
Sorry about that.

12:44.431 --> 12:45.432
Mmm.

12:45.466 --> 12:47.368
Better get out of this wet shirt.

12:47.636 --> 12:48.836
Okay.

12:51.839 --> 12:53.474
Is he okay, honey?

12:53.508 --> 12:54.975
Yeah, he's fine.

12:55.009 --> 12:56.810
Ooh.

12:56.844 --> 12:58.479
You know, it might be
the flowers.

12:58.513 --> 12:59.813
Sure.

13:02.149 --> 13:03.183
It's okay.

13:03.217 --> 13:04.852
Here we are,
my dear Lena.

13:08.922 --> 13:11.091
- It's all name value.
- Sorry?

13:11.125 --> 13:13.027
Market is tribal.

13:13.060 --> 13:14.928
Real artists don't
have a hope.

13:14.962 --> 13:17.164
Well, my wife's work
is selling as well as ever.

13:17.197 --> 13:19.466
I graduated in anthropology
three years ago.

13:19.501 --> 13:23.003
It qualifies me for babysitting
and table dancing.

13:25.573 --> 13:28.342
- A dark room.
- Erm, please, that's private.

13:29.943 --> 13:32.279
We have these
at the Red Velvet.

13:32.313 --> 13:34.315
The club where I dance.

13:34.348 --> 13:36.216
Can I ask you
to go out, please?

13:38.653 --> 13:40.522
Should come and see me
some time.

13:42.323 --> 13:43.457
Careful.

13:45.025 --> 13:46.460
To be continued.

13:46.493 --> 13:48.162
No, no. Go on!

13:48.195 --> 13:50.030
No, no, no,
it's time to sleep.

13:50.064 --> 13:52.132
- Please!
- No, no, no, no, no.

13:52.166 --> 13:54.368
Time to sleep.
Good night. Good night.

13:56.003 --> 13:57.237
Tickle?

13:57.271 --> 13:58.305
Tickle?

14:00.274 --> 14:03.578
Tickle! Tickle! Tickle!

14:03.611 --> 14:06.480
- All right.
- Tickle! Tickle!

14:06.514 --> 14:07.881
You ready?

14:08.683 --> 14:09.883
Ready?

14:16.624 --> 14:18.058
Stop that!

14:19.627 --> 14:21.228
They need to go to sleep.

14:24.365 --> 14:25.999
All right.

14:26.033 --> 14:27.401
Sleep tight, girls.

15:05.673 --> 15:07.107
Hey, you.

15:11.078 --> 15:12.580
Why are you awake?

15:14.148 --> 15:16.083
Why you not sleeping?

15:25.359 --> 15:26.493
Ros?

15:34.034 --> 15:35.235
Ros...

15:35.269 --> 15:36.604
He's crying.

15:36.638 --> 15:38.405
And I need to get
him out.

15:41.375 --> 15:42.443
Ros...

15:44.445 --> 15:46.514
Honey, come back to bed.

15:49.249 --> 15:50.552
You're dreaming.

15:51.686 --> 15:54.354
Come back
to bed, honey. Come.

16:02.362 --> 16:03.531
Is Ros still upstairs?

16:03.565 --> 16:06.166
Yeah, she needs
a bit of rest, I think.

16:07.535 --> 16:09.303
Good morning, Amadeo.

16:22.149 --> 16:23.250
Morning.

16:27.154 --> 16:28.590
Will...

16:28.623 --> 16:31.158
I got a call from
Newcastle City Council.

16:31.191 --> 16:32.594
Mmm-hmm.

16:32.627 --> 16:35.597
If we win this bid, we won't have
to worry for the next three years.

16:35.630 --> 16:36.664
That's great.

16:36.698 --> 16:39.032
I'm making you project leader.
You know that.

16:39.066 --> 16:40.502
Yeah, that's fine. Fine.

16:40.535 --> 16:43.805
Hey, it's good.
It's all we worked for. Well done!

16:43.838 --> 16:47.040
You know, my sister
had godawful depression

16:47.074 --> 16:48.308
after her second child.

16:48.342 --> 16:49.777
She's tired. That's all.

16:49.811 --> 16:51.245
It's gonna be fine.

16:59.086 --> 17:00.153
<i>Hey, Will.</i>

17:00.187 --> 17:02.422
She's taken Amadeo for a
check-up at the hospital.

17:02.456 --> 17:03.625
<i>He's not due.</i>

17:04.124 --> 17:05.527
Is something wrong?

17:05.560 --> 17:06.694
<i>He's fine!</i>

17:22.677 --> 17:23.811
Ros.

17:27.782 --> 17:30.083
They're all
nameless babies.

17:30.117 --> 17:31.218
See?

17:33.655 --> 17:36.123
This is where
they buried his twin.

17:37.157 --> 17:38.526
You're lying to me.

17:38.560 --> 17:40.460
Ros...
No one is lying.

17:42.396 --> 17:44.331
Everyone lies.

17:45.265 --> 17:46.701
All the time.

17:58.913 --> 18:00.414
Milton...

18:02.884 --> 18:04.786
I need to talk to you.

18:05.485 --> 18:07.555
About Ros.

18:07.589 --> 18:10.390
She's a bit stressed
after the birth.

18:10.424 --> 18:13.226
Well, no surprise there.

18:14.394 --> 18:16.664
Dr. Muller's good.

18:16.698 --> 18:20.233
She's been seeing him
on and off for years.

18:20.267 --> 18:22.302
More of a specialist really.

18:22.336 --> 18:23.738
My job to know.

18:26.574 --> 18:28.342
Lugano is in Switzerland.

18:29.309 --> 18:31.278
She's a well-travelled girl.

18:31.311 --> 18:32.479
He Skypes.

18:34.281 --> 18:37.250
My GP might as well
be in Switzerland.

18:37.284 --> 18:40.420
The time it takes to get an
appointment's a bloody disgrace.

18:41.789 --> 18:43.223
Here you are.

18:43.256 --> 18:44.324
Thank you.

18:46.527 --> 18:48.462
Oh. Do they work?

18:50.330 --> 18:51.365
Some.

18:52.734 --> 18:54.434
Collector's dispensation.

18:55.903 --> 18:58.773
And that's my service pistol.
On the right there.

18:58.806 --> 19:00.575
I could never
see you in the Army.

19:00.608 --> 19:04.378
Military intelligence.
Beats business school.

19:07.481 --> 19:10.518
Ros, aged 14.

19:10.551 --> 19:13.755
Photographed by
the august John Birtram Raven,

19:13.788 --> 19:17.825
CBE, RA, FRPS,
the list goes on.

19:17.859 --> 19:19.861
Bertie or JB
as I knew him.

19:19.894 --> 19:21.328
Vivian's brother.

19:21.361 --> 19:22.897
Uh, step brother.

19:22.930 --> 19:24.766
75 Gs on that wall.

19:25.432 --> 19:26.634
Uh-huh.

19:27.669 --> 19:29.904
"Bel Reve, France."

19:29.937 --> 19:30.772
Seaside place.

19:30.805 --> 19:33.808
Viv inherited from him
when he died.

19:33.841 --> 19:35.777
Place is a wreck.
She never goes.

19:36.844 --> 19:38.813
You know,
I'm in a position to help.

19:38.846 --> 19:39.947
Financially. Whatever.

19:39.981 --> 19:42.550
Milton, I can
look after us.

19:42.583 --> 19:44.251
Don't be too proud, Will.

20:01.002 --> 20:02.369
What?

20:02.402 --> 20:03.604
Nothing.

20:04.839 --> 20:07.608
All the things
you don't say.

20:14.048 --> 20:16.349
Why are you looking at me
like that?

20:18.986 --> 20:21.421
I went to see Milton

20:22.790 --> 20:24.491
about your depression.

20:25.492 --> 20:26.928
But I'm not depressed.

20:26.961 --> 20:30.464
Will, I'm not depressed and you
should talk to me when it's about me.

20:30.497 --> 20:32.399
Honey, can I show you
something?

20:34.502 --> 20:36.303
Let me see your hand.

20:41.776 --> 20:43.578
Do you know
how this happened?

20:47.048 --> 20:49.984
Do you know why our brand
new wallpaper's all shredded?

20:52.754 --> 20:55.489
You did it.
In your sleep.

20:56.758 --> 20:58.358
You were sleepwalking.

21:26.453 --> 21:28.990
Shh, shh, shh. What are you doing?

21:30.490 --> 21:32.794
Hey, you. Bye-bye.

21:35.395 --> 21:37.732
Uh, I'm back from
Newcastle tomorrow night.

21:37.765 --> 21:40.001
Please remember to pick the
girls up from swimming, okay?

21:40.034 --> 21:41.368
Sure.

21:42.036 --> 21:43.470
Bye, Lena.

21:47.775 --> 21:49.076
Rosalind Pallister?

21:49.110 --> 21:50.611
Oh, sure.

21:59.520 --> 22:00.855
No, because
we're good at this.

22:00.888 --> 22:02.557
We are good at this.

22:02.590 --> 22:05.860
Now, how much time do you
need for the final specs?

22:05.893 --> 22:08.361
Three, four days?

22:08.395 --> 22:10.765
I can't believe they need
one more bridge here.

22:10.798 --> 22:11.899
I know.

22:11.933 --> 22:13.400
City Center, please.

22:26.614 --> 22:27.682
Ros?

23:11.092 --> 23:12.994
Ros, what's going on?
Where are the kids?

23:13.027 --> 23:14.595
Call me, please?

23:16.197 --> 23:17.899
Candy, are you
with Ros?

23:17.932 --> 23:19.499
Please ask her
to call me.

23:56.938 --> 23:58.471
Oh, for fuck's sake!

23:58.506 --> 23:59.874
Bloody hell!

24:00.608 --> 24:02.610
How did you get in?

24:03.443 --> 24:05.980
My dear boy,
you left the door open.

24:09.684 --> 24:11.786
Milton, what's going on?
Where are they?

24:11.819 --> 24:14.522
I don't know.

24:14.555 --> 24:16.958
She called yesterday to
say that she was leaving.

24:18.993 --> 24:21.028
I tried to talk her
out of it, of course.

24:21.996 --> 24:23.864
What happened
between you two?

24:23.898 --> 24:26.067
Nothing.
Absolutely nothing. Why?

24:26.100 --> 24:27.735
Well, she was so angry.

24:27.768 --> 24:29.870
So determined to leave.

24:31.038 --> 24:32.540
I'm gonna call the police.

24:32.573 --> 24:34.575
- What can they do?
- She took the passports

24:34.608 --> 24:36.844
and she took my son
maybe out of the country.

24:36.877 --> 24:39.213
Calm down.
Take a breath.

24:40.881 --> 24:44.085
She's not well, Milton.
She's not well.

24:45.886 --> 24:46.921
I know.

24:49.790 --> 24:51.592
Let me just
try her again.

24:56.998 --> 25:00.067
<i>Hi, Ros here.
Leave a message. Bye.</i>

25:00.101 --> 25:02.203
Ros, it's me. Again.

25:02.236 --> 25:06.540
Listen whatever this is,
whatever you think this is,

25:06.574 --> 25:09.010
we can work it out.
I'm sure.

25:09.043 --> 25:10.277
We can fix it.

25:11.746 --> 25:13.981
Please, call me.

25:14.015 --> 25:15.282
Come home.

27:33.954 --> 27:35.823
<i>Do you have
any of his portraits?</i>

27:35.856 --> 27:37.458
Unfortunately not.

27:37.491 --> 27:41.295
His last 20 years were dedicated
to travel and landscapes.

27:41.328 --> 27:43.464
He could make a tree knot
look subversive.

27:43.497 --> 27:44.698
Mmm-hmm.

27:44.732 --> 27:48.736
I predict a 15% rise in market
value within five years.

27:48.769 --> 27:50.070
He had a place
in France, right?

27:50.104 --> 27:52.373
Normandy. His early work
is very hard to get.

27:52.406 --> 27:54.041
I would say impossible.

28:41.288 --> 28:43.857
Hi, Milton, it's Will.

28:43.891 --> 28:48.429
Did she mention that a parcel
came that day from Normandy?

28:48.462 --> 28:50.431
Please gimme
a call back.

29:19.460 --> 29:21.095
Hello?

29:22.997 --> 29:25.032
Hello? Hello?

29:25.065 --> 29:27.001
<i>Please ask him
to come.</i>

29:28.035 --> 29:30.037
Girls, is that,
is that you?

29:30.070 --> 29:31.805
<i>We need him
right now.</i>

29:31.839 --> 29:34.174
<i>Someone has to come
put Mummy in the pram.</i>

29:34.208 --> 29:35.809
What do you mean
"Mummy in the pram"?

29:35.843 --> 29:37.512
Is Mummy there?
Can you put her on, please?

29:39.213 --> 29:40.881
Hello? Girls?

30:28.929 --> 30:29.963
Fuck.

30:31.533 --> 30:34.134
<i>I got your text
about JB's beach house.</i>

30:34.168 --> 30:35.570
- <i>Did someone want to buy?</i>
- Where is it?

30:35.603 --> 30:38.238
<i>Larenguebec. No one's been
there for years.</i>

30:38.272 --> 30:41.241
<i>I wouldn't be surprised if it had
fallen off the edge of the cliff.</i>

30:42.142 --> 30:43.243
<i>Everything all right?</i>

31:23.551 --> 31:27.488
<i>Bonjour.</i> Um, I'm looking
for this woman.

31:27.522 --> 31:29.957
Have you seen her?
Do you speak English?

31:31.693 --> 31:33.661
What do you want?

31:33.695 --> 31:37.297
I'm, uh, I'm looking for,
for this woman.

31:38.432 --> 31:39.466
Have you seen her?

31:40.968 --> 31:42.504
- No.
- Sure?

31:42.537 --> 31:43.538
Aye.

31:44.639 --> 31:46.641
It's my wife.
My children.

31:49.143 --> 31:50.177
No.

32:24.011 --> 32:25.212
Ros!

32:27.147 --> 32:28.248
Ros!

32:30.050 --> 32:31.218
Candy!

32:33.420 --> 32:34.522
Ros!

32:46.300 --> 32:48.335
I had it first!

32:50.170 --> 32:51.506
It's mine!

32:53.808 --> 32:55.142
Stop!

32:56.410 --> 32:59.146
Not fair! Give it back!

32:59.179 --> 33:00.715
Girls!

33:00.748 --> 33:02.416
Ow! That hurt!

33:02.449 --> 33:04.218
Girls, stop fighting! Stop!

33:04.251 --> 33:06.253
Stop, stop, stop, stop!
What are you fighting for?

33:06.286 --> 33:08.055
Wha... Stop.

33:08.088 --> 33:09.256
What's going on?

33:10.491 --> 33:13.393
You all right?
I've been worried.

33:13.427 --> 33:14.629
Where's Mummy?

33:14.662 --> 33:18.098
She doesn't come out anymore.
She has to stay in the dark.

33:19.433 --> 33:21.468
What d'you mean?

33:21.503 --> 33:23.470
Where's Candy
and Amadeo?

33:23.505 --> 33:26.240
They're for Amadeo
to get better.

33:28.843 --> 33:30.712
Is... Is he not well?

33:32.079 --> 33:33.413
What's wrong with him?

33:34.281 --> 33:36.049
Has Candy
called a doctor?

33:36.551 --> 33:38.385
She fell in the sea.

33:38.418 --> 33:40.622
She did not.
She went to get help!

33:40.655 --> 33:42.590
Did... Did she call a doctor?
Please, girls?

33:42.624 --> 33:44.258
She was too scared.

33:44.291 --> 33:46.093
She was not!
She wouldn't leave us!

33:46.126 --> 33:47.494
Girls.
No, no, no, no!

33:50.665 --> 33:52.700
Let's go back now.

33:52.734 --> 33:54.702
See if we can
find them. Right?

33:57.371 --> 33:58.840
Come on.
Let's find Amadeo and...

33:58.873 --> 34:01.441
- We'll push it.
- No, I'll push it. It's far too heavy.

34:01.475 --> 34:03.110
We'll push it!

34:10.117 --> 34:12.654
Hurry! Hurry up!
Mummy needs a doctor!

34:12.687 --> 34:14.288
We'll leave Amadeo outside.

34:14.321 --> 34:16.791
Stop! Stop! Girls, girls,
girls, stop. Please.

34:17.692 --> 34:20.360
Please, no more games.

34:20.394 --> 34:22.296
We're not playing, Will.

35:47.749 --> 35:51.753
Girls, I, I need you to go
and stay with Mummy now.

35:52.654 --> 35:53.821
Okay?

35:53.855 --> 35:55.056
You just go
and stay with Mummy.

35:55.089 --> 35:57.859
I'm gonna, I'm gonna run down
and try and get some help.

35:57.892 --> 35:59.060
Don't leave us!

35:59.093 --> 36:01.863
I need to get some help.
Please go and stay with Mummy.

36:01.896 --> 36:03.330
We're not grown up!

36:03.363 --> 36:04.632
Please, girls.

36:12.305 --> 36:14.307
Need some help.

36:15.275 --> 36:16.644
Need some help.

37:55.910 --> 37:56.944
Ros.

38:00.447 --> 38:01.649
What happened?

38:04.886 --> 38:09.056
It's me. It's Will.

38:13.094 --> 38:14.729
Ros...

38:17.064 --> 38:21.035
Amadeo, what
happened to him?

38:38.786 --> 38:41.856
Please...
It's me. It's Will.

38:42.990 --> 38:44.025
Please.

38:45.392 --> 38:47.427
You need to tell me
what happened.

38:49.697 --> 38:51.632
Please stop it!
Stop, stop!

38:51.666 --> 38:53.668
Where is Candy?

38:55.603 --> 38:57.505
Please.

38:57.538 --> 39:00.440
No, Will, stop! No!

39:00.473 --> 39:01.976
Better!

39:02.009 --> 39:03.611
No, no, no.

39:16.791 --> 39:17.859
Will?

39:19.894 --> 39:20.928
Will!

39:22.663 --> 39:24.364
Will, it's you.

39:24.932 --> 39:26.801
Ah, it's Will.

39:32.874 --> 39:34.575
Ah, we need rest.

39:35.710 --> 39:37.678
That's all I want is rest.

39:38.813 --> 39:40.413
Get some rest.

39:40.848 --> 39:42.083
Oh...

40:39.740 --> 40:42.843
Hello? Police?
Ambulance?

40:44.578 --> 40:45.813
Hello?

40:49.650 --> 40:50.685
Um...

40:51.285 --> 40:52.520
<i>Hello?</i>

40:55.589 --> 40:57.024
<i>Hello?</i> Monsieur?

44:51.825 --> 44:53.427
We're hungry.

44:53.460 --> 44:56.864
We'll get something on the
road when we're packed.

44:56.897 --> 44:59.200
Should we take Amadeo
to the beach?

45:02.336 --> 45:05.239
Girls...

45:05.272 --> 45:07.908
do you remember when
we found that baby bird

45:07.942 --> 45:09.877
that had fallen
from its nest?

45:09.910 --> 45:11.979
Who couldn't hold
his head up.

45:12.012 --> 45:13.447
Yes. We buried him.

45:13.480 --> 45:16.450
Put a stone to remember him
by, to keep him safe.

45:16.483 --> 45:18.385
So he could go
to Heaven.

45:19.153 --> 45:21.488
Yeah. That's right.

45:21.523 --> 45:23.390
Is Mummy going
to heaven, too?

45:23.424 --> 45:25.527
Mummy will be fine.

45:25.560 --> 45:27.194
We just need
to help her.

45:29.496 --> 45:31.265
Just take it easy.

45:31.298 --> 45:33.234
It's fine, it's fine.

45:33.267 --> 45:35.503
We're just going
up to the car.

45:35.537 --> 45:37.104
All right. Come on.

45:38.405 --> 45:40.874
Come on, you can do it.
It's all right.

45:41.842 --> 45:44.311
Hey. Is she okay?

45:44.345 --> 45:47.481
Yeah, she's fine, thank you.
I'm just taking her home.

45:47.515 --> 45:48.916
She's well,
no problem.

45:48.949 --> 45:50.284
Thank you. Thank you.

45:52.286 --> 45:54.188
Take it easy, honey.
Take it easy. Take it easy.

45:54.221 --> 45:56.457
Come on,
we're getting into the car.

46:04.832 --> 46:06.900
Can I, can I ask you...
Please let go of her.

46:06.934 --> 46:08.902
Come on, darling,
we need to go.

46:08.936 --> 46:11.272
Darling, darling,
come on.

46:12.373 --> 46:13.541
- Yes, thank you.
- Doctor.

46:13.575 --> 46:14.808
- Thank you.
- Doc... understand?

46:14.842 --> 46:16.377
Thank you, I understand.
Thank you.

46:19.514 --> 46:22.082
Just need to get
in the car. Come on.

47:49.637 --> 47:51.405
I came as quickly as I could.

47:54.308 --> 47:56.243
She was off her medication?

47:56.276 --> 47:57.444
She's stabilized now.

48:02.249 --> 48:03.250
Where's that Candy?

48:04.451 --> 48:06.353
Being useful with the baby
for once, I hope?

48:06.387 --> 48:08.623
We need to talk.

48:08.656 --> 48:12.660
She hasn't had an episode in...
three years.

48:12.694 --> 48:13.994
Not since she met you.

48:15.630 --> 48:18.031
Milton told me
how worried you are.

48:18.065 --> 48:20.134
That he gave you
Dr. Muller's number.

48:21.068 --> 48:22.169
Yes, that's right.

48:22.202 --> 48:25.540
But before that I'd never heard
your name. Not once.

48:25.573 --> 48:28.242
It's printed on the medication.

48:28.275 --> 48:31.245
- Well, that's for migraine.
- That's what she told you?

48:31.278 --> 48:32.547
How could you not know?

48:32.580 --> 48:33.715
It's not uncommon.

48:33.748 --> 48:37.351
Even if she wanted to tell you,
she probably couldn't.

48:37.384 --> 48:40.320
Dissociative memory loss
is a well know side effect

48:40.354 --> 48:41.589
of a schizophrenic breakdown.

48:44.391 --> 48:45.560
She's schizophrenic?

48:50.598 --> 48:53.000
And... And when did she
come here the first time?

48:55.402 --> 48:57.539
- When she was 14.
- 14!

49:02.544 --> 49:03.711
It was, um...

49:04.679 --> 49:07.047
JB's summer assistant,

49:08.148 --> 49:09.551
Pierre Laurent.

49:09.584 --> 49:11.385
They say it was rape.

49:13.220 --> 49:14.254
He got the maximum.

49:14.288 --> 49:16.089
Milton's lawyers
made sure of it.

49:16.123 --> 49:18.025
Of course, the villagers
took his side.

49:18.058 --> 49:20.662
Village...
where I found her?

49:20.695 --> 49:22.597
God knows why
she went back there.

49:25.065 --> 49:26.133
Is this him?

49:32.674 --> 49:34.509
He forgives her?

49:34.542 --> 49:36.410
He destroyed her childhood!

49:38.245 --> 49:39.480
Where did you get this?

49:39.514 --> 49:41.281
I was too late, Vivian.

49:41.315 --> 49:43.183
I mean, if only you'd
told me when she couldn't,

49:43.217 --> 49:44.351
but you didn't.

49:44.384 --> 49:46.654
If only I'd known,
none of this would have happened.

49:46.688 --> 49:47.988
None of it.

49:54.796 --> 49:56.196
You buried him?

49:56.230 --> 49:58.131
I tried to save her, Vivian.

49:58.165 --> 49:59.466
I tried to save us all.

49:59.501 --> 50:00.802
Candy was missing,

50:00.835 --> 50:03.671
and every scenario ended up
with Ros being blamed.

50:06.173 --> 50:08.442
I was in shock
for fuck's sake!

50:13.615 --> 50:16.283
I have to face up.
Go to the authorities.

50:16.316 --> 50:19.019
No. She's my daughter.
You don't think that...

50:21.255 --> 50:24.559
- You can't think that she...
- I don't think anything.

50:25.660 --> 50:27.227
My son is dead.

50:28.328 --> 50:30.497
Amadeo is dead.

50:37.271 --> 50:40.073
Is there anything else
I need to know, Vivian?

50:42.810 --> 50:45.613
Go. Find Candy.

50:47.214 --> 50:50.384
I'll look after my daughter
and my grandchildren.

50:50.417 --> 50:53.086
But please,
think of them first.

51:04.766 --> 51:07.735
A Mrs. Joy Williams.

51:07.769 --> 51:10.705
I'm looking
for her sister Candy.

51:10.738 --> 51:13.541
Have you got
a forwarding address, please?

51:14.408 --> 51:15.510
Or a number?

51:17.177 --> 51:18.813
All right.

51:18.846 --> 51:20.515
Thank you.

52:26.413 --> 52:27.381
Yes?

52:27.414 --> 52:28.248
<i>Is that Mr. Pallister?</i>

52:28.281 --> 52:30.518
- Walsh.
- <i>Rosalind's husband right?</i>

52:30.551 --> 52:32.319
- Yes.
- <i>Love her work.</i>

52:32.920 --> 52:35.188
<i>About the car accident.</i>

52:35.222 --> 52:36.557
<i>Can you confirm
where it happened?</i>

53:23.604 --> 53:26.007
Sooner or later, every man
has something to hide.

53:26.040 --> 53:28.308
I need to tell the truth, Mil.

53:28.341 --> 53:29.777
Oh, you buried the truth.

53:29.811 --> 53:32.013
I'm not saying
it was the wrong decision,

53:32.046 --> 53:34.214
but you do have to think
how it might look.

53:35.817 --> 53:38.418
I kept it simple.
Car accident abroad.

53:38.452 --> 53:39.954
But, but this guy
and her past...

53:39.987 --> 53:41.522
I've been checking regularly.

53:41.556 --> 53:42.690
No one's picked it up.

53:42.724 --> 53:44.491
A journalist has been
calling the house.

53:44.525 --> 53:46.728
- I mean, I'm being followed.
- Will...

53:46.761 --> 53:48.629
You have to get a grip.

53:48.663 --> 53:51.999
Look, French death certificate

53:52.033 --> 53:53.534
police accident report,

53:53.568 --> 53:55.737
all verified
by the French Consulate.

53:55.770 --> 53:58.371
- How?
- I'll settle for a thank you.

53:58.405 --> 53:59.439
Plus...

54:01.509 --> 54:03.644
- Please...
- It'll tide you over.

54:05.680 --> 54:08.415
Priorities.
Rosalind and the twins.

54:08.448 --> 54:10.383
- Hmm.
- We wait for Rosalind to improve.

54:10.417 --> 54:11.853
When she talks,
then we decide.

54:11.886 --> 54:13.888
- Not before.
- And what about Candy?

54:13.921 --> 54:15.623
Well, Candy's disappearance

54:15.656 --> 54:16.724
points to guilt,
wouldn't you say?

54:16.758 --> 54:18.492
Even more reason
to go to the police.

54:18.526 --> 54:21.361
Oh, no, let's leave the
police out of it for now.

54:21.394 --> 54:22.897
Milton, I need to know.

54:22.930 --> 54:25.533
I need to find out
how he died.

54:39.914 --> 54:40.915
Thank you.

54:41.549 --> 54:43.518
Uh, I'm looking for Becca.

54:44.484 --> 54:46.319
Becca, does she work here?

54:57.497 --> 55:00.668
Please tell her a friend
was in a car accident.

55:00.701 --> 55:01.803
Thank you.

55:47.447 --> 55:51.853
99.9 percent certain these are
from the lost Normandy series,

55:51.886 --> 55:53.420
<i>In the Garden of Good
and Evil.</i>

55:53.453 --> 55:55.122
And no one else
could have taken them?

55:55.156 --> 55:56.489
Oh, I don't think so.

55:58.025 --> 55:59.060
Where did you get them?

56:00.094 --> 56:02.063
Private collection.

56:02.096 --> 56:03.998
You know his assistant
was jailed for rape?

56:04.031 --> 56:06.399
- Yes, yes.
- They found incriminating photos

56:06.433 --> 56:08.401
of the underage victim
in his home.

56:08.435 --> 56:09.937
He claimed that
he was framed.

56:09.971 --> 56:12.106
- That the photos...
- Were Raven's, I know, yeah.

56:12.139 --> 56:14.441
Well, he was
a celebrated photographer.

56:14.474 --> 56:16.409
The assistant
didn't stand a chance.

56:17.578 --> 56:19.947
But surely
the victim must have...

56:19.981 --> 56:22.049
Too traumatized to testify.

56:22.083 --> 56:23.383
Allegedly.

56:25.019 --> 56:26.486
Think it was her?

56:40.935 --> 56:42.003
How is she?

56:42.770 --> 56:44.404
She's, um...

56:46.173 --> 56:47.742
She's coming home.

56:48.876 --> 56:49.877
Soon.

56:52.647 --> 56:54.414
Will, what happened
out there?

56:58.219 --> 57:00.487
My wife is coming home
in a couple of days,

57:02.256 --> 57:04.191
and I don't know
how to deal with it.

57:07.862 --> 57:08.963
I wish I did.

57:12.667 --> 57:16.570
Oh, Lena,
they look so wonderful.

57:21.909 --> 57:25.846
I was so sad to hear
about the accident.

57:25.880 --> 57:28.249
Everything that happened.

57:30.017 --> 57:32.620
Lena, thank you
for all your help.

57:32.653 --> 57:34.522
Ros really needs to rest now.

57:34.555 --> 57:37.091
You go to bed.
I made borscht.

57:37.124 --> 57:38.993
Borscht is fine.

57:40.995 --> 57:43.097
I miss the twins.

57:43.130 --> 57:44.699
They're fine
with your mother.

57:44.732 --> 57:46.233
- It's gonna be all right.
- Yeah.

58:50.364 --> 58:51.799
Hi.

58:51.832 --> 58:52.833
Hi.

59:04.011 --> 59:05.846
I don't remember
making these.

59:11.986 --> 59:14.221
Mum says there was
a car accident...

59:15.389 --> 59:16.891
and our baby died.

59:19.894 --> 59:22.129
Which is why
I was ill for so long.

59:26.033 --> 59:27.301
I know I had a baby,

59:29.937 --> 59:32.339
but I can't find
any of his things.

59:34.942 --> 59:36.277
I packed them up.

59:36.944 --> 59:37.945
Why?

59:42.283 --> 59:43.784
Guess it hurt.

59:46.287 --> 59:47.588
I was angry.

59:49.090 --> 59:51.959
- Angry?
- Yes.

59:51.992 --> 59:54.829
Ros, can you please try
and make me understand?

59:55.996 --> 59:57.698
Talk me through
what happened.

1:00:05.706 --> 1:00:09.009
Listen, I know, I...
Maybe I should have asked, but...

1:00:11.212 --> 1:00:14.381
Why didn't you tell me that
you needed those prescriptions?

1:00:20.020 --> 1:00:21.989
Why did you stop
taking your pills?

1:00:38.272 --> 1:00:40.841
- <i>We miss you, Mummy!</i>
- I miss you, too.

1:00:40.875 --> 1:00:43.277
Hi, girls. All good?

1:00:43.310 --> 1:00:44.445
<i>We're gonna leave now.</i>

1:00:44.478 --> 1:00:47.014
<i>To the mountains with ponies.</i>

1:00:47.047 --> 1:00:48.349
And then home.

1:00:48.382 --> 1:00:50.084
<i>When Mummy's better.</i>

1:00:50.117 --> 1:00:54.155
Oh, but, I am better.
Aren't I, Lena?

1:00:54.188 --> 1:00:58.025
We see you
very soon, darlings.

1:00:58.058 --> 1:01:01.362
<i>Bye.</i>

1:01:12.339 --> 1:01:13.474
Hey, excuse me.

1:01:13.508 --> 1:01:16.110
Can you help me?
I'm looking for a girl called Becca.

1:01:16.143 --> 1:01:18.112
I think she works here.

1:01:18.145 --> 1:01:19.446
Perhaps she's
got a different name here.

1:01:19.480 --> 1:01:20.714
- I mean...
- Fuck off, will you?

1:01:20.748 --> 1:01:21.749
Hey. I'm just...

1:01:23.851 --> 1:01:25.085
Take it easy.

1:02:38.359 --> 1:02:39.960
Let's just leave the city.

1:02:41.061 --> 1:02:42.564
Go to the sun.

1:02:42.597 --> 1:02:45.199
Find an old house on a cliff.

1:02:45.232 --> 1:02:48.269
You know, like the one
in Sestri you love so much.

1:02:48.302 --> 1:02:49.803
Are you asking me
to marry you?

1:02:51.305 --> 1:02:54.008
See, my memory's
getting better.

1:02:56.076 --> 1:02:58.879
You know, the girls
can go to a local school.

1:02:58.912 --> 1:03:01.849
I can work remotely,
or get something local.

1:03:01.882 --> 1:03:04.885
- I mean ev...
- If we had a car accident,

1:03:04.918 --> 1:03:07.254
how come we still have
the same car?

1:03:35.382 --> 1:03:36.850
I remember.

1:03:39.253 --> 1:03:40.522
I remember

1:03:41.955 --> 1:03:44.559
I didn't want
to take my pills anymore.

1:03:46.093 --> 1:03:49.363
When I felt him
in my belly, growing,

1:03:51.198 --> 1:03:53.167
because I didn't
want to hurt him.

1:03:56.303 --> 1:03:57.304
Go on.

1:04:00.007 --> 1:04:01.208
And, er,

1:04:01.942 --> 1:04:03.243
I remember...

1:04:04.579 --> 1:04:07.214
hands pulling me
through the window.

1:04:08.382 --> 1:04:10.184
The twins crying.

1:04:15.623 --> 1:04:18.025
Was that the accident
Mum told me about?

1:04:21.629 --> 1:04:23.964
That was no car accident.

1:04:29.236 --> 1:04:31.004
Amadeo died.

1:04:32.439 --> 1:04:34.208
And we don't know why.

1:05:24.726 --> 1:05:25.959
Hey.

1:05:26.994 --> 1:05:28.328
What are you
doing with that?

1:05:28.362 --> 1:05:31.131
Mr. Milton tell me he
want me to give it to him.

1:05:31.599 --> 1:05:32.600
Milton?

1:05:32.634 --> 1:05:35.169
He said it's okay with
you and Miss Rosalind.

1:05:36.638 --> 1:05:38.540
How did you even know
where to find it?

1:05:41.175 --> 1:05:42.309
Give it to me.

1:05:42.342 --> 1:05:43.977
Give it to me!

1:05:45.245 --> 1:05:46.346
What's going on?

1:05:53.320 --> 1:05:56.156
What are you doing
with this case?

1:05:56.190 --> 1:05:57.224
Let's wait with this one.

1:05:57.257 --> 1:05:58.726
- Let's, let's, let's...
- Wait, wait. Is this...

1:06:03.798 --> 1:06:05.432
Have you got a key
to our house?

1:06:06.433 --> 1:06:08.469
I'm taking Rosalind
for tea.

1:06:08.503 --> 1:06:09.671
Isn't that right, Ros?

1:06:11.138 --> 1:06:13.006
To er,
to talk about this?

1:06:14.576 --> 1:06:16.043
You opened it.

1:06:16.076 --> 1:06:17.077
Why?

1:06:17.377 --> 1:06:19.313
Ask him.

1:06:19.346 --> 1:06:21.215
- I've never opened it.
- No.

1:06:21.248 --> 1:06:22.784
Well, let's wait
till you're better.

1:06:22.817 --> 1:06:24.251
Oh, no, I am better.

1:06:24.284 --> 1:06:25.452
You don't know that.

1:06:26.688 --> 1:06:28.021
The doctor says I'm better.

1:06:28.055 --> 1:06:29.323
I... I feel better.

1:06:29.356 --> 1:06:31.693
I look better.
I'm better.

1:06:33.661 --> 1:06:35.295
I'm fucking better, okay?

1:06:35.329 --> 1:06:36.664
Then why are you yelling?

1:06:37.431 --> 1:06:38.633
Because it's you.

1:06:38.666 --> 1:06:40.200
You made this place
a morgue.

1:06:40.234 --> 1:06:42.135
Ros, it is a morgue.

1:06:42.169 --> 1:06:44.238
Our son is dead.
You took him and he died.

1:06:44.271 --> 1:06:45.305
- Stop it, Will.
- How dare you?

1:06:45.339 --> 1:06:47.140
- How dare you?
- Your memory

1:06:47.174 --> 1:06:48.643
- is so convenient, isn't it?
- Let me go!

1:06:48.676 --> 1:06:50.210
You're hurting...

1:06:50.244 --> 1:06:51.579
- No!
- Amadeo.

1:06:51.613 --> 1:06:52.680
- Remember?
- No.

1:06:52.714 --> 1:06:53.748
- No? No.
- No. No.

1:06:53.781 --> 1:06:54.682
- Enough!
- So convenient, isn't it?

1:06:54.716 --> 1:06:56.784
- I don't remember.
- Outside, Will. Outside!

1:06:56.818 --> 1:06:58.185
I don't remember!

1:06:59.086 --> 1:07:00.153
Wait.

1:07:06.761 --> 1:07:08.796
I've worked out
why you're so desperate

1:07:08.830 --> 1:07:11.064
for those missing photos.

1:07:11.098 --> 1:07:13.066
To save your precious
Raven's arse!

1:07:13.100 --> 1:07:14.468
I won't let you
unravel this.

1:07:14.502 --> 1:07:15.637
Fuck you!

1:07:15.670 --> 1:07:17.204
It needs to disappear.

1:07:17.237 --> 1:07:18.405
Stay buried.

1:07:18.438 --> 1:07:22.777
Nothing can be gained from
Rosalind reliving this trauma.

1:07:22.810 --> 1:07:26.179
You want the twins
taken away from her? Hmm?

1:07:26.213 --> 1:07:28.448
Taken away from you?
Is that what you want?

1:07:30.852 --> 1:07:33.186
We have to protect
the ones we love.

1:07:48.536 --> 1:07:50.838
<i>♪ Happy birthday to you ♪</i>

1:08:03.417 --> 1:08:05.419
<i>You let them
take my baby.</i>

1:08:13.393 --> 1:08:15.295
<i>You love your wife.</i>

1:08:18.365 --> 1:08:19.601
<i>She's my daughter.</i>

1:08:19.634 --> 1:08:20.802
<i>You don't think that...</i>

1:08:20.835 --> 1:08:22.737
<i>You can't think that she...</i>

1:08:22.770 --> 1:08:25.640
<i>Is there anything else
I need to know, Vivian?</i>

1:08:30.410 --> 1:08:33.681
<i>Mummy says that
he has to stay in the light.</i>

1:09:08.516 --> 1:09:10.484
<i>Hey, it's Becca.</i>

1:09:14.656 --> 1:09:17.592
- So...
- I haven't seen her in weeks.

1:09:17.625 --> 1:09:19.594
She's off Facebook,
Instagram,

1:09:19.627 --> 1:09:20.895
her phone just rings.

1:09:20.928 --> 1:09:22.429
Becca.

1:09:22.462 --> 1:09:25.833
Please, help me.

1:09:25.867 --> 1:09:28.503
I really need to find
out where she is.

1:09:29.103 --> 1:09:30.505
Have you tried
her mum?

1:09:30.538 --> 1:09:32.305
- Yes. Yes.
- Her sister?

1:09:34.474 --> 1:09:36.443
Look, I read
about the car crash.

1:09:36.476 --> 1:09:38.445
I'm so sorry.

1:09:38.478 --> 1:09:40.682
No, Becca, listen. Can we...

1:09:45.485 --> 1:09:46.587
I'll be next door.

1:09:47.454 --> 1:09:49.524
So now what?
You're gonna blackmail me?

1:09:49.557 --> 1:09:50.892
Not if you listen.

1:09:58.132 --> 1:09:59.901
So those videos...

1:09:59.934 --> 1:10:01.301
That was you?

1:10:02.537 --> 1:10:05.472
<i>Amadeo, you should
lie down, darling.</i>

1:10:05.506 --> 1:10:06.874
<i>You need to rest.</i>

1:10:08.009 --> 1:10:09.544
<i>You okay, darling?</i>

1:10:10.912 --> 1:10:12.647
<i>Are you a bit hot?</i>

1:10:12.680 --> 1:10:13.715
<i>Yeah.</i>

1:10:13.748 --> 1:10:14.682
So he was sick?

1:10:14.716 --> 1:10:16.851
It seemed like a summer cold.
That's all.

1:10:20.521 --> 1:10:22.322
The villagers hated us.

1:10:22.355 --> 1:10:23.858
We'd throw those crabs out.

1:10:23.891 --> 1:10:25.560
In the morning
they'd be back.

1:10:26.594 --> 1:10:27.762
Stank.

1:10:28.462 --> 1:10:30.832
Made Ros mad.

1:10:30.865 --> 1:10:32.700
She yelled at them
in the bar.

1:10:35.469 --> 1:10:37.337
She was having
problems before we left.

1:10:38.873 --> 1:10:40.340
She rang Milton.

1:10:40.373 --> 1:10:41.542
Screamed and yelled at him.

1:10:41.576 --> 1:10:44.011
Then started packing.

1:10:44.045 --> 1:10:46.681
She kept saying everything
was her fault.

1:10:48.015 --> 1:10:51.384
She was obsessed with finding
the guy that sent the parcel.

1:10:51.819 --> 1:10:53.286
Who is he?

1:10:53.320 --> 1:10:54.622
She wouldn't say.

1:10:54.655 --> 1:10:56.724
The night on the beach,
I saw them.

1:10:56.758 --> 1:10:58.659
That night just sent her
over the edge.

1:11:01.629 --> 1:11:02.630
<i>Ros.</i>

1:11:07.434 --> 1:11:08.368
- <i>Don't make a noise.</i>
- <i>You're scaring them.</i>

1:11:08.401 --> 1:11:11.304
<i>No,
we have to hide. No.</i>

1:11:11.338 --> 1:11:12.974
<i>No, put them back on!</i>

1:11:13.007 --> 1:11:14.509
<i>Put them back on!</i>

1:11:14.542 --> 1:11:15.910
Somebody's
stolen his twin.

1:11:15.943 --> 1:11:17.545
We had to protect Amadeo.

1:11:17.578 --> 1:11:19.412
<i>Get out!</i>

1:11:19.446 --> 1:11:22.016
<i>Get out of here!</i>

1:11:22.049 --> 1:11:25.787
She locked his bedroom
door and wouldn't let anyone in.

1:11:27.922 --> 1:11:29.456
The next morning...

1:11:31.092 --> 1:11:32.560
<i>Amadeo?</i>

1:11:35.530 --> 1:11:36.631
<i>Ros!</i>

1:11:37.899 --> 1:11:39.967
I got scared and ran.

1:11:41.636 --> 1:11:43.805
I'm sorry.

1:11:43.838 --> 1:11:44.906
I loved him.

1:11:45.973 --> 1:11:47.975
But so did Ros.

1:12:27.081 --> 1:12:28.683
How did I get here?

1:12:29.650 --> 1:12:30.751
Mmm...

1:12:34.822 --> 1:12:37.058
Ah, these are not mine.

1:12:38.092 --> 1:12:39.994
Mild sedative.

1:12:40.027 --> 1:12:41.529
Doctor's orders.

1:12:58.946 --> 1:13:00.548
I want the twins.

1:13:01.015 --> 1:13:02.617
In good time.

1:13:09.023 --> 1:13:11.525
Please, let me sleep.

1:13:27.541 --> 1:13:28.576
Ros?

1:13:31.679 --> 1:13:34.615
Milton, let me in
for God's sake!

1:13:36.884 --> 1:13:38.953
Milton!

1:13:40.988 --> 1:13:42.823
Milton!

1:13:44.992 --> 1:13:46.493
Police?

1:13:47.628 --> 1:13:49.630
Milton!

1:13:49.664 --> 1:13:51.198
Open the door!

1:13:53.734 --> 1:13:55.603
Milton, let me in!

1:13:56.237 --> 1:13:57.838
Please! Five minutes!

1:14:00.942 --> 1:14:02.677
Open the door!

1:14:26.767 --> 1:14:29.603
Milton! Open the
God damn door!

1:14:30.938 --> 1:14:32.540
Milton!

1:15:04.038 --> 1:15:05.072
You.

1:15:05.106 --> 1:15:06.674
I just want to help you.

1:15:07.008 --> 1:15:08.009
Okay?

1:15:09.610 --> 1:15:11.112
You're Pierre Laurent.

1:15:11.145 --> 1:15:12.847
Tell me what
you know about my son.

1:15:12.880 --> 1:15:14.281
I know nothing
about your son.

1:15:20.654 --> 1:15:23.691
At the trial they called me
photographer's assistant.

1:15:24.725 --> 1:15:28.562
I was not.
I was doing everything,

1:15:28.596 --> 1:15:30.131
but touch a camera, never.

1:15:31.932 --> 1:15:36.070
<i>One night, she came to me
carrying a camera case.</i>

1:15:36.103 --> 1:15:37.671
<i>She wanted a place
to hide it.</i>

1:15:40.841 --> 1:15:44.612
<i>She asked me to wait
while she buried it.</i>

1:15:44.645 --> 1:15:46.347
<i>And when she's done,
she starts running.</i>

1:15:51.318 --> 1:15:52.353
<i>But when I touch her,</i>

1:15:52.386 --> 1:15:54.221
<i>she starts screaming.</i>

1:15:58.092 --> 1:16:01.095
<i>For years, I expected
the prison door to open</i>

1:16:01.128 --> 1:16:03.631
<i>and see her
standing there,</i>

1:16:03.664 --> 1:16:05.266
<i>saying she was sorry.</i>

1:16:07.701 --> 1:16:09.670
You know,
after I came out,

1:16:09.703 --> 1:16:11.272
I searched
for that hiding place.

1:16:12.807 --> 1:16:14.608
It had been 20 years.
I found it.

1:16:18.012 --> 1:16:19.713
But why send them
to her now?

1:16:21.082 --> 1:16:22.083
Raven's dead.

1:16:23.184 --> 1:16:24.285
But Milton is not.

1:16:32.359 --> 1:16:33.727
Look at the ring
on his finger.

1:16:44.805 --> 1:16:45.806
You want her?

1:16:46.307 --> 1:16:47.308
I want him.

1:17:16.170 --> 1:17:19.073
<i>Milton,
I know it was you.</i>

1:17:19.106 --> 1:17:20.841
You don't know
what you're talking about.

1:17:20.875 --> 1:17:22.343
<i>I have proof.</i>

1:17:22.376 --> 1:17:25.012
<i>But I'll leave you alone
if you let me take my wife.</i>

1:19:03.210 --> 1:19:04.211
Stay still.

1:20:05.072 --> 1:20:06.273
I'm a quiet man.

1:20:07.509 --> 1:20:08.510
Hate fuss.

1:20:11.613 --> 1:20:12.813
Work hard.

1:20:14.315 --> 1:20:15.449
People rely on me.

1:20:20.187 --> 1:20:21.589
After all
I've done for you.

1:20:21.623 --> 1:20:22.657
Where is she?

1:20:22.691 --> 1:20:26.126
Rosalind's always understood
what she was doing.

1:20:26.160 --> 1:20:28.128
- You just don't get it.
- You know that's a lie.

1:20:30.665 --> 1:20:33.100
That signet ring
you're so proud of.

1:20:35.002 --> 1:20:36.170
It's there.

1:20:36.203 --> 1:20:38.205
In every picture.

1:20:39.541 --> 1:20:43.010
You know, it really
is a tight-knit,

1:20:43.043 --> 1:20:45.613
self-preserving
little community at the top.

1:20:47.515 --> 1:20:49.116
I could have you
put away for life.

1:20:50.184 --> 1:20:52.587
You screwed it up
all by yourself.

1:20:52.620 --> 1:20:55.122
Buried him in some
misguided belief

1:20:55.155 --> 1:20:56.423
you were saving
the woman you love.

1:20:56.457 --> 1:20:57.625
You're a sick person.

1:20:57.659 --> 1:20:59.126
No.

1:20:59.159 --> 1:21:00.595
I was different
from JB.

1:21:01.629 --> 1:21:02.630
I just loved her.

1:21:03.531 --> 1:21:05.432
I adored her.

1:21:13.073 --> 1:21:14.241
I own her.

1:21:15.710 --> 1:21:17.044
I always have.

1:21:28.455 --> 1:21:29.657
What did I ever
do to you?

1:21:31.291 --> 1:21:33.360
Please, stop.
I beg you.

1:21:33.394 --> 1:21:35.095
Did you stop
when I begged you?

1:21:35.462 --> 1:21:36.497
No, please!

1:21:37.431 --> 1:21:40.267
You said Pierre
did those things to me.

1:21:42.236 --> 1:21:43.237
He was my friend.

1:21:48.175 --> 1:21:49.176
Why?

1:21:51.513 --> 1:21:52.514
I want to know.

1:21:53.615 --> 1:21:54.649
I want your love.

1:21:55.315 --> 1:21:56.917
That's all
I ever wanted.

1:21:59.654 --> 1:22:00.655
Ros.

1:22:03.157 --> 1:22:04.458
Ros.

1:22:04.491 --> 1:22:05.492
I need you.

1:22:09.196 --> 1:22:10.565
The twins need you.

1:22:12.734 --> 1:22:13.934
Don't.

1:24:06.146 --> 1:24:07.147
Careful, girls.

1:24:08.583 --> 1:24:10.150
Hatty!
Hatty, come back.

1:24:12.620 --> 1:24:13.621
You'll need your towel.

1:24:17.391 --> 1:24:18.626
Where are you going?

1:24:18.660 --> 1:24:19.661
Where are you going?

1:24:33.741 --> 1:24:35.208
<i>Uno.</i>

1:24:35.242 --> 1:24:37.311
- <i>Due.</i>
- <i>Due.</i>

1:24:37.344 --> 1:24:39.413
- <i>Tre.</i>
- <i>Tre.</i>

1:24:39.446 --> 1:24:41.181
- <i>Quattro.</i>
- <i>Quattro.</i>

1:24:41.214 --> 1:24:42.550
What comes next?

1:24:44.184 --> 1:24:45.419
What?

1:24:51.258 --> 1:24:52.359
What about the toes?

1:24:52.392 --> 1:24:54.161
We already
covered your feet.

1:24:54.194 --> 1:24:55.563
Did you?

1:24:55.597 --> 1:24:56.598
I can see them.

1:24:57.230 --> 1:24:59.634
Oh, I just
covered them.

1:25:00.233 --> 1:25:01.234
Cheeky.

1:25:03.705 --> 1:25:04.739
Are you gonna
leave me here?

1:25:10.612 --> 1:25:11.613
I can't move.

1:25:47.347 --> 1:25:48.783
We're in
the Bay of Silence.
