WEBVTT

01:05.232 --> 01:07.359
  I have always loved the old.

01:09.028 --> 01:12.198
  I have loved them for almost
as long as I have been alive.

01:13.407 --> 01:16.202
  Since I was first aware
of their hands around mine.

01:24.126 --> 01:25.169
  I love them still.

01:26.337 --> 01:28.798
  It is my work, it is my joy.

01:29.840 --> 01:30.883
  It is my purpose.

01:38.974 --> 01:39.975
  Vali.

01:40.434 --> 01:42.353
-Vali.

01:42.770 --> 01:45.689
  But we are all here.
And Nani loves the scarf.

01:45.815 --> 01:46.732
  Okay, listen, listen.

01:46.816 --> 01:48.359
  Your nieces have a question for you.

01:48.484 --> 01:51.779
  Is it true the patients
call you Dr Valentine?

01:52.071 --> 01:53.155
  Haan,   they do.

01:53.906 --> 01:55.699
  Why, when it's not your name?

01:55.783 --> 01:57.451
Because nobody knows how to say

01:57.535 --> 01:58.869
Valinder Singh Vashisht.

02:05.334 --> 02:07.670
-  Bye!
-  Bye!

02:08.170 --> 02:09.755
  Love you. Miss you.

02:12.466 --> 02:14.093
Good morning, Dr Valentine.

02:14.260 --> 02:16.345
Oh, erm, my grandmother loved the scarf.

02:16.470 --> 02:19.348
Oh! Well, said you couldn't go wrong
with fuchsia, didn't I?

02:20.266 --> 02:22.017
You're a bit earlier than usual,
aren't you?

02:22.309 --> 02:23.686
The television crew are coming.

02:23.853 --> 02:25.688
About the campaign to save the hospital.

02:26.063 --> 02:28.399
 Oh, well,
glad someone's taking up the cudgels.

02:29.066 --> 02:31.402
In the meantime, you'd best
head through to Mr Jessop.

02:32.111 --> 02:33.529
Oh, has he
taken a turn for the worse?

02:33.863 --> 02:34.780
Worse.

02:35.698 --> 02:37.700
-No, but he was fine...
-I spoke to the goddaughter.

02:37.825 --> 02:40.202
She was of the view
that cremation would be favoured.

02:57.595 --> 02:58.554
Minister.

02:59.555 --> 03:02.141
Thanks. He's in the, erm, The Bethlehem.

03:02.224 --> 03:05.144
Oh, or The Beth, as they call it up there.

03:06.729 --> 03:09.398
Yeah, well, you know
all these small places

03:09.481 --> 03:11.650
are earmarked for closure,
one way or another.

03:11.942 --> 03:14.278
It's policy. Your policy.

03:14.361 --> 03:15.404
I advised you on it.

03:17.448 --> 03:20.409
Yeah, well, that, er...
that won't be difficult.

03:21.118 --> 03:24.413
Its, er, failings will be legion.

03:24.997 --> 03:27.708
Good morning to you.
Good morning

03:27.791 --> 03:29.209
I see Bouncing Betty's

03:29.293 --> 03:30.794
-back on shift again.

03:35.257 --> 03:36.884
Morning, good morning

03:39.261 --> 03:40.095
-Morning.
-Morning.

03:40.179 --> 03:41.513
Good morning to you

03:42.848 --> 03:45.643
I hope that girl remembers I have a cup.

03:46.310 --> 03:47.478
Not a beaker.

03:49.229 --> 03:51.273
They only give you a beaker in The Royal

03:51.357 --> 03:52.608
if you're terminal.

03:53.400 --> 03:55.986
You're not in The Royal now,
Lucille, you're in The Beth.

03:58.280 --> 03:59.949
This is chipped.

04:01.158 --> 04:03.827
No wonder the government
are going to close you down.

04:06.330 --> 04:08.207
You know the way
we do it, Ambrose.

04:08.457 --> 04:10.876
Dr Jones and I have seen
to the two certificates.

04:11.293 --> 04:13.671
And this will remain in situ
till the undertaker comes.

04:13.754 --> 04:17.007
So, fare thee well, Mr Jessop,

04:18.008 --> 04:19.301
who died in the night.

04:19.760 --> 04:20.761
As people do.

04:21.387 --> 04:22.638
It's rather rude of him.

04:23.347 --> 04:25.182
Doesn't he realise there's a queue?

04:28.310 --> 04:30.229
I've just cleared out Mr Jessop's locker.

04:30.646 --> 04:32.106
I thought nippy work were in order,

04:32.189 --> 04:33.565
since we're under pressure bed-wise.

04:33.649 --> 04:35.526
Well, we're always
under pressure bed-wise.

04:36.151 --> 04:36.986
It's been twice as bad

04:37.069 --> 04:38.862
since they shut down
Barbara Cartland Ward.

04:39.571 --> 04:41.240
He didn't really have anyone
to bring him things.

04:41.657 --> 04:42.950
Goddaughter's in Southampton.

04:44.451 --> 04:45.411
Infirmary.

04:46.120 --> 04:48.914
I'm delighted to inform you
we've a free bed at The Beth.

04:49.790 --> 04:50.708
In the men's bay.

04:52.376 --> 04:54.420
No, I'm afraid I can't oblige you
on the women's side.

04:55.212 --> 04:57.214
We have just moved a lady
on to Snowdrop Court,

04:57.339 --> 04:59.425
but her space has gone
to an ankle from The Royal.

05:01.176 --> 05:02.970
Well, maybe they're nicer
to me than you are.

05:04.972 --> 05:06.181
Do you want the men's bed or not?

05:07.766 --> 05:08.809
Yes, thought so.

05:11.186 --> 05:12.396
There's a pair of glasses.

05:16.567 --> 05:18.819
I'll put them in the box
for the Africa appeal.

05:24.491 --> 05:26.368
What do you mean,
you're calling about helium balloons?

05:27.536 --> 05:30.247
Well, I don't care if they are
for a Sister Gilpin's party.

05:30.330 --> 05:31.999
This is a busy hospital department,

05:32.082 --> 05:33.459
and I am Sister Gilpin!

05:36.503 --> 05:37.796
Helium balloons.

05:38.714 --> 05:39.882
Well, they're in your honour, Alma.

05:40.591 --> 05:41.967
You've won a prize.

05:43.510 --> 05:45.471
My service has been acknowledged.

05:45.596 --> 05:47.931
There's no call
for the purchase of party novelties.

05:50.267 --> 05:52.561
-No, soft toys on the right.
-Like this?

05:52.770 --> 05:54.855
- That's nice.
-Right.

05:55.022 --> 05:58.525
How about this
from a standing start, Dr Valentine?

05:58.609 --> 06:00.402
-Marks out of ten?
-Twenty.

06:00.527 --> 06:02.362
The Friends of The Beth
aren't just volunteers.

06:02.821 --> 06:04.531
We're like the little ships of Dunkirk,

06:04.656 --> 06:06.408
poised to mobilise in her hour of need.

06:06.492 --> 06:08.285
We sent a round robin out
about the tabards.

06:08.368 --> 06:10.412
And the sweatshirts.
People were getting sloppy.

06:10.496 --> 06:12.539
Yeah, well, we can't have that
if we're going on television.

06:14.750 --> 06:15.667
Excuse me, gentlemen.

06:15.793 --> 06:17.252
Are you the team from Pennine People?

06:17.336 --> 06:19.546
-Yes.
-Oh. I am Dr Valentine.

06:19.713 --> 06:20.881
We have spoken on the telephone.

06:20.964 --> 06:21.799
Hi. I'm Abdul.

06:22.424 --> 06:23.258
How do?

06:24.051 --> 06:25.552
Well, thank you for supporting our cause.

06:26.011 --> 06:28.222
The notice of closure
came as something of a shock.

06:28.388 --> 06:31.433
Mm. We're a local programme.
This is a local institution.

06:32.059 --> 06:33.685
Founded 1897?

06:33.811 --> 06:36.522
The year Queen Victoria
celebrated her Diamond Jubilee

06:36.605 --> 06:39.233
and coincidentally, aspirin was invented.

06:40.025 --> 06:41.485
Wow, here?

06:42.069 --> 06:43.320
No, in Germany, I believe.

06:43.904 --> 06:45.781
Germany won't play on Pennine People.

06:46.698 --> 06:48.325
I'm sorry. An ambulance is just arriving.

06:50.452 --> 06:51.453
Right, steady on.

06:51.954 --> 06:53.831
Right, you go and park.
I'll go with Mother.

06:56.542 --> 06:58.168
Ambulance. The Royal.

06:58.585 --> 07:00.504
A night on a trolley. Another ambulance.

07:00.838 --> 07:02.381
-All present and correct.

07:02.965 --> 07:04.800
We even had a little singsong
along the ring road.

07:04.883 --> 07:07.219
It's all right, Mother. I'm here now.

07:07.302 --> 07:09.721
It was my house!

07:09.805 --> 07:10.639
Oh, is it any wonder

07:10.722 --> 07:11.932
she don't know which way is up?

07:12.015 --> 07:13.976
All is well, my love. All is well.

07:14.101 --> 07:15.102
We will look after you.

07:25.070 --> 07:26.530
Greetings, Shirley Bassey Ward.

07:26.613 --> 07:28.824
We've got a treat lined up
for all of you today.

07:29.158 --> 07:32.202
Gorgeous Gerald, the physio,
will be paying us a call.

07:32.327 --> 07:33.245
Ooh, that's it.

07:33.495 --> 07:36.081
I'm definitely wearing my shorty nightie.

07:36.456 --> 07:38.834
Well, there'll be some singing first
to open up your lungs,

07:38.917 --> 07:41.461
and then he'll get to work
with his magic hands.

07:41.587 --> 07:45.591
Well, last time, he said
my knee would take priority.

07:46.216 --> 07:48.343
I'm a more interesting case.

07:48.677 --> 07:52.389
He gives me tissue massage
on my lymphomania.

07:52.472 --> 07:54.266
Oh, it's your lymphoedema, Hazel.

07:54.975 --> 07:55.934
And please be advised

07:56.018 --> 07:57.895
he'll be doing my neck first. Come on.

07:58.228 --> 08:01.481
You're not a patient, that's incestuous.

08:02.608 --> 08:04.693
Alma, I'm just giving Mary a freshen-up.

08:05.068 --> 08:06.195
She needs everything clean on.

08:06.278 --> 08:07.529
Well, pop it in her notes.

08:10.616 --> 08:12.075
Do you want the toilet, Molly?

08:13.327 --> 08:14.953
Come on, then. Come on, love.

08:20.876 --> 08:23.962
I take it you're the, er...
the Pennine People people?

08:24.421 --> 08:26.506
-Morning.
-Yes. Abdul. Kieran.

08:26.590 --> 08:27.674
Are you the Chair?

08:28.342 --> 08:29.885
-Chairman of the Board.
-Yeah.

08:29.968 --> 08:31.678
Executive or non-executive?

08:32.137 --> 08:35.057
Well, non-executive.
It's an honorary position.

08:35.307 --> 08:37.684
You can't fill a crucial role
like this with a hired hand.

08:37.768 --> 08:39.645
No, the bureaucrats administrate,

08:40.145 --> 08:41.355
I champion. Yeah.

08:41.772 --> 08:43.440
No, this isn't just a hospital.

08:43.941 --> 08:45.067
It's The Beth.

08:45.567 --> 08:47.110
And The Beth is the people.

08:47.611 --> 08:53.408
Yours till the stars lose their glory

08:54.701 --> 08:59.706
Yours till the birds fail to sing

09:00.707 --> 09:05.712
Yours to the end of life's story

09:06.588 --> 09:12.469
This pledge to you, dear, I bring

09:13.553 --> 09:17.015
Here or on far distant shores

09:19.893 --> 09:22.437
You have a lovely voice, Mrs Maudsley.

09:22.688 --> 09:25.065
She sang in concert halls
as a little girl.

09:25.899 --> 09:26.984
And on the wireless.

09:27.818 --> 09:30.237
They called her the Pudsey Nightingale.

09:30.946 --> 09:32.614
A soprano, unless I'm mistaken.

09:33.115 --> 09:34.449
There is definite recognition

09:34.616 --> 09:36.034
when we go through her scrapbook with her.

09:36.201 --> 09:39.788
And her memory for the lyrics
is immaculate.

09:40.080 --> 09:42.624
Oh, people with dementia
can sometimes sing

09:42.749 --> 09:43.917
even when they cannot talk.

09:44.293 --> 09:46.461
The more mobile can even dance
when they hear music.

09:46.837 --> 09:47.754
I wouldn't push it.

09:48.463 --> 09:50.674
She bust her ankle
just trying to get off the commode.

09:51.466 --> 09:53.593
This is Mr Hunsley, Dr Valentine.

09:53.677 --> 09:55.554
He's to wait in here
until his bed's ready.

09:56.638 --> 09:57.472
Sir.

09:57.681 --> 10:00.183
Dr Valentine will come
and see you, Mr Hunsley.

10:01.893 --> 10:03.312
You're in good hands.

10:04.354 --> 10:07.733
Meanwhile, I have a berth
ready and waiting

10:07.816 --> 10:10.068
for a Blanche Alice Maudsley.

10:10.152 --> 10:12.070
Transferred from The Royal A & E.

10:12.237 --> 10:14.573
This is the lady, and this is her family.

10:15.490 --> 10:17.743
I believe we have a recruit
for music therapy.

10:18.327 --> 10:19.786
Mrs Maudsley is a soprano.

10:20.203 --> 10:21.038
How nice.

10:21.496 --> 10:22.956
I'll come and examine her on the ward.

10:23.206 --> 10:24.124
Right.

10:25.375 --> 10:27.878
Would Mother like to be called
Blanche or Mrs Maudsley

10:27.961 --> 10:28.962
while she's with us?

10:30.672 --> 10:32.341
-Oh, I think Mrs Maudsley.
-Yes.

10:32.632 --> 10:34.760
I favour formal terms. Is she continent?

10:34.968 --> 10:36.219
It's all relative.

10:37.012 --> 10:38.388
It was my house.

10:41.433 --> 10:42.351
Mm.

10:45.187 --> 10:46.104
Hmm?

10:46.688 --> 10:49.691
You know, I thought you might like to film
my interview in here.

10:50.359 --> 10:53.487
The background illustrates
the history of the hospital.

10:54.154 --> 10:55.697
Meanwhile, I, as Chairman,

10:55.781 --> 10:57.449
represent its essential essence.

10:57.657 --> 11:00.369
There's a picture of you
here in a dress.

11:00.911 --> 11:02.746
No, I'm in costume.

11:03.163 --> 11:04.498
As Queen Victoria.

11:04.664 --> 11:05.707
It is what one does

11:05.791 --> 11:08.085
-when a hospital has to be supported.

11:08.168 --> 11:10.796
Look, er, I happened to be Mayor as well

11:11.004 --> 11:12.506
-when that was taken.
- Hmm.

11:12.798 --> 11:14.091
-You're a busy man.
-Yeah, well...

11:14.174 --> 11:18.428
I've been Mayor twice.
It's a woman currently.

11:19.054 --> 11:20.514
First time for everything, eh?

11:21.515 --> 11:26.561
Meanwhile, we at The Beth
are fighting for our right to care

11:26.645 --> 11:28.480
from the cradle to the grave.

11:29.189 --> 11:30.190
Are we ready to...

11:30.690 --> 11:31.650
Gentlemen.

11:32.275 --> 11:33.610
I am sorry to have been delayed.

11:33.819 --> 11:36.571
We've made very satisfactory
strides in your absence.

11:37.114 --> 11:39.282
I think we can trust the team
to represent us well.

11:39.699 --> 11:42.077
My hope is that
we can represent the people well.

11:42.285 --> 11:44.871
-We've been through all that.
-The old people. The patients.

11:45.372 --> 11:47.040
This is their refuge and their right.

11:48.208 --> 11:49.251
Without The Beth,

11:50.210 --> 11:51.795
I don't like to think
where they will have to go.

11:53.338 --> 11:54.256
Oh.

11:55.841 --> 11:57.968
I don't know why your school
have even sent you here.

11:58.427 --> 12:00.971
We don't offer work experience in nursing.

12:01.138 --> 12:02.806
I shall have to attach you to the porters.

12:03.181 --> 12:05.976
I asked Careers for Computing,
but I applied too late.

12:06.768 --> 12:08.270
I've brought him some theatre pants

12:08.395 --> 12:10.772
and an occupational therapist top half.

12:11.022 --> 12:12.732
-Right.
-It's all I could find in a medium.

12:15.402 --> 12:16.236
What's this?

12:16.695 --> 12:18.738
Well, we endeavour to rise
above leisurewear, Andy.

12:19.197 --> 12:20.991
Helps the old folks keep their bearings.

12:22.868 --> 12:24.578
I hope those trainers are wipe clean.

12:24.786 --> 12:26.204
They'll be getting urine on them.

12:27.664 --> 12:28.498
Come on.

12:47.851 --> 12:48.977
Take me to The Beth.

12:51.396 --> 12:52.522
I can tell you're local.

12:53.523 --> 12:55.775
Some people coming from down south
like to have the window open.

12:56.109 --> 12:57.569
They reckon they can smell the moors.

12:58.320 --> 13:00.363
All I can smell is the past.

13:01.323 --> 13:04.826
You made me love you

13:05.243 --> 13:09.122
And all the time you knew it
I guess you always knew it

13:09.498 --> 13:15.629
You made me happy sometimes
You made me glad

13:15.754 --> 13:16.963
Lovely!

13:17.547 --> 13:21.009
But there were times when

13:21.384 --> 13:23.887
You made me feel so bad

13:24.054 --> 13:26.890
Now remember
who we're going to be singing this for.

13:27.224 --> 13:31.895
Lovely, lovely Sister Gilpin
at her medal presentation.

13:32.020 --> 13:33.188
Yes, we are.

13:33.939 --> 13:37.692
I want some love that's true

13:37.901 --> 13:40.904
Yes, I do, 'deed I do
You know I do

13:41.571 --> 13:45.492
Gimme, gimme, gimme,
gimme what I cry for

13:45.742 --> 13:47.035
-You know you've got
-Lovely big breath in

13:47.118 --> 13:48.453
-for that massive finish!
-The brand of kisses

13:48.578 --> 13:49.871
That I'd die for

13:49.955 --> 13:50.914
Thanks.

13:53.708 --> 13:55.126
-Save The Beth. Save The Beth.
-Yeah.

13:55.961 --> 13:58.713
Fiver a strip to win a week in Cleethorpes

13:59.256 --> 14:01.049
or guess the name of the teddy
for a pound.

14:01.132 --> 14:03.134
Or you can sponsor me to do a skydive.

14:03.718 --> 14:06.429
Pledge now, pay later. Every little helps.

14:06.513 --> 14:08.848
We're not unaware
we're David against Goliath.

14:09.349 --> 14:12.978
But, really, after nigh
on 122 years' service,

14:13.228 --> 14:15.230
they can't expect us
to go down without a fight.

14:15.313 --> 14:16.856
I'm looking for Dusty Springfield.

14:17.065 --> 14:17.983
In person?

14:20.110 --> 14:21.319
Dusty Springfield Ward.

14:21.903 --> 14:24.072
Straight down, first right, second left.

14:24.531 --> 14:25.448
Thanks.

14:28.577 --> 14:31.162
Neville, are you going to
join in the filming?

14:31.413 --> 14:33.415
Not if I'm the only bloody bloke.

14:34.082 --> 14:36.918
Well, I'm a bloke. And so is Ambrose.

14:37.085 --> 14:38.253
Ambrose don't count.

14:38.336 --> 14:40.171
He always got his headphones on.

14:40.672 --> 14:42.799
Where the other one? Glasses.

14:43.258 --> 14:45.302
-Oh, you mean Mr Jessop?
- Mm.

14:45.385 --> 14:47.137
-He's gone.
-Gone where?

14:47.721 --> 14:48.888
Rattled his clack.

14:49.598 --> 14:50.599
In the night.

14:51.057 --> 14:52.934
He was very obese.

14:53.101 --> 14:55.437
Well, he shall be missed in the choir.

14:55.979 --> 14:56.813
He was a bass.

14:56.896 --> 14:58.857
Yeah, well, maybe he was a bass
because he was obese.

14:59.733 --> 15:01.443
And it's not a choir, it's music therapy.

15:03.737 --> 15:06.323
You can't start filming yet.

15:07.490 --> 15:10.577
I'm still busy whitening the sepulchre.

15:10.660 --> 15:11.870
Er, no, no, don't worry.

15:11.953 --> 15:13.997
We're doing a group interview first,

15:14.080 --> 15:15.832
just so I can get to know everybody.

15:16.207 --> 15:18.209
Then we're hoping to talk
to you one at a time

15:18.293 --> 15:20.837
and ask some quick-fire questions.

15:22.005 --> 15:23.214
I can't hear you.

15:23.632 --> 15:26.426
You've still got
your headphones on.

15:28.345 --> 15:29.429
What's the matter, Molly?

15:30.221 --> 15:31.139
Do you need toilet?

15:32.515 --> 15:34.643
All right. But they're trying
to make a film.

15:35.018 --> 15:36.353
Will you let me mind your tray for you?

15:36.436 --> 15:37.771
-Love, don't bang it...
-What's all this?

15:38.938 --> 15:40.940
She never wallops that tray
for no reason, you know.

15:41.524 --> 15:43.985
You all right, Molly?
You come with me, love.

15:44.235 --> 15:46.237
We'll work our way through the checklist.

15:46.863 --> 15:47.697
Come on.

15:50.283 --> 15:51.618
No, you can have it back when you've been.

15:51.701 --> 15:53.286
I know it's important to you, Molly.

15:53.912 --> 15:55.497
If you're the new registrar,

15:55.622 --> 15:57.832
we have a policy
of nothing below the wrist.

15:58.625 --> 16:00.126
Your watch. You'll have to take it off.

16:00.502 --> 16:01.920
I'm a visitor. Not a doctor.

16:02.003 --> 16:04.047
Oh, yes, of course, the T-shirt.

16:04.172 --> 16:05.799
Still, it's a fine line these days.

16:06.091 --> 16:09.010
If this is Dusty Springfield,
I'm looking for Joe Colman.

16:09.886 --> 16:11.346
Might I ask if you're a relative?

16:11.638 --> 16:12.597
Mm-hm. His son.

16:13.556 --> 16:15.558
The son that works
for the Health Minister?

16:17.143 --> 16:20.021
No. Just the one
who works in his department.

16:20.689 --> 16:22.440
I'm an independent management consultant.

16:22.774 --> 16:25.068
Hmm. Nevertheless,
he's told us all about you.

16:25.819 --> 16:28.405
Your chauffeur-driven car,
your bank holiday at Chequers.

16:28.488 --> 16:29.572
That was purely social.

16:30.990 --> 16:33.034
Right, well, I shall escort you
to the office.

16:33.159 --> 16:36.287
I'll come back and take Molly
to the lavatory. Stay here.

16:36.830 --> 16:37.664
Right, come on.

16:40.542 --> 16:41.459
Mrs Maudsley?

16:42.460 --> 16:43.294
Blanche?

16:43.753 --> 16:45.630
I need to examine your eyes, Blanche.

16:45.922 --> 16:47.257
Just to rule out any anaemia.

16:48.717 --> 16:50.051
It was my house.

16:51.386 --> 16:52.512
They took it from me.

16:54.347 --> 16:55.348
How is her appetite?

16:56.349 --> 16:57.600
She eats like a navvy.

16:57.851 --> 17:00.353
I have her on a full low-fat diet

17:00.520 --> 17:02.522
ever since she was diagnosed
with gallstones.

17:02.605 --> 17:03.440
Mine.

17:04.315 --> 17:06.276
They're no better than thieves!

17:06.776 --> 17:08.486
Is she usually confused?

17:09.154 --> 17:10.780
No. I mean, catch her on a good day,

17:10.905 --> 17:12.240
she's... she's bright as a button.

17:14.242 --> 17:16.453
She might benefit
from some of the activities

17:16.536 --> 17:17.579
we have in the day room.

17:18.079 --> 17:19.247
Singing, for example.

17:19.372 --> 17:21.166
I'm sorry.

17:22.292 --> 17:25.670
Is this a hospital,
or is it Butlin's bandstand?

17:26.129 --> 17:28.006
She doesn't want entertaining.

17:28.256 --> 17:29.257
I'm telling you now,

17:29.382 --> 17:31.342
you do not want her entertaining you.

17:32.177 --> 17:33.303
Pudsey Nightingale.

17:33.386 --> 17:34.387
Mitchell!

17:36.890 --> 17:38.892
Do you know?
You've a lovely manner with her.

17:39.601 --> 17:40.602
I like old people.

17:40.769 --> 17:44.063
Rubbish. Even old people
don't like old people.

17:44.189 --> 17:46.024
So, what's the survival rate?

17:48.276 --> 17:49.319
Survival rate?

17:50.653 --> 17:51.780
Your mother is 92.

17:52.697 --> 17:54.824
Well, yes, I know,
but we wouldn't want to lose her.

17:55.366 --> 17:56.910
Erm... Er...

17:57.911 --> 17:58.828
Yet.

17:59.162 --> 18:00.079
Look,

18:01.080 --> 18:01.956
she's ill.

18:02.499 --> 18:03.541
You're a hospital.

18:04.209 --> 18:05.084
Cure her!

18:05.919 --> 18:08.880
I'm afraid there's no cure,
as such, for old age, sir.

18:09.756 --> 18:11.132
We can't offer long-term care.

18:12.300 --> 18:14.260
It's a bloody good job she's so far gone.

18:15.386 --> 18:16.971
She'd want to know
what she paid her stamp for

18:17.055 --> 18:18.139
for all those years.

18:19.307 --> 18:20.809
-Are you rolling?
-Rolling.

18:23.061 --> 18:27.357
Sir, can I ask you your name,
and what you did in life?

18:27.941 --> 18:31.194
My name is Ambrose Hammersley.

18:31.694 --> 18:35.406
In life, as you put it,
I was a schoolmaster.

18:36.074 --> 18:40.370
Now I'm in a wheelchair
due to osteo-arthritis

18:40.453 --> 18:44.332
and the regulation issue fall.

18:44.541 --> 18:47.085
I've got osteo-arthritis too.

18:48.044 --> 18:51.130
Yes, I... I push his chair sometimes.

18:51.256 --> 18:52.632
We've a lot in common.

18:52.841 --> 18:55.510
Take no notice of this lady.
She's confused.

18:56.010 --> 18:58.137
-We're engaged.
-Oh, bugger off.

18:58.263 --> 18:59.597
Oh, language!

18:59.681 --> 19:01.641
What... Don't you "language" me.

19:01.891 --> 19:03.309
I taught language.

19:03.476 --> 19:04.686
Fratch, fratch, fratch.

19:05.144 --> 19:08.064
Can't we show a bit more support
to these nice young gentlemen?

19:08.731 --> 19:11.150
Er, Lucille, tell them about your life.

19:12.235 --> 19:13.069
Well,

19:13.695 --> 19:15.488
-I was a housewife.

19:15.780 --> 19:17.448
And I brought up a son.

19:17.991 --> 19:19.534
Who emigrated to Australia.

19:20.118 --> 19:21.411
That's an achievement in itself.

19:22.120 --> 19:26.499
Also, my father had a chain
of confectioners shops.

19:26.583 --> 19:30.003
Oh! Did he do vanilla slices?

19:30.253 --> 19:32.505
I don't recall.

19:32.964 --> 19:34.757
Oh, can't be much of a confectioner

19:34.841 --> 19:37.343
if he didn't do vanilla slices.

19:38.553 --> 19:41.222
I had a wild side.

19:42.140 --> 19:44.767
But nobody has ever
interviewed me about it.

19:44.851 --> 19:46.603
I think you should talk to Neville next.

19:48.855 --> 19:49.939
Tell us about yourself, Neville.

19:50.690 --> 19:53.443
Even just tell us why you're in The Beth.

19:54.319 --> 19:55.695
Because I old.

19:55.820 --> 19:57.071
Well, we're all old.

19:57.280 --> 19:59.282
What's the matter with you besides?

19:59.574 --> 20:00.909
Did you have a fall?

20:01.075 --> 20:03.912
Not everybody falls, Mavis.

20:04.829 --> 20:07.290
I'm here because of my dizzy dos.

20:07.999 --> 20:10.251
By rights, I ought
to be a private patient.

20:10.335 --> 20:12.545
Oh. What does that matter?

20:13.296 --> 20:16.633
Dead, we're all on a slab
in our birthday suits.

20:17.008 --> 20:19.010
I used to work in a factory.

20:20.386 --> 20:21.971
I had 10 men under me.

20:22.597 --> 20:24.223
So did I on a good day.

20:34.525 --> 20:35.443
Am I still here?

20:35.777 --> 20:37.320
We haven't sent you back to The Rowans,

20:37.403 --> 20:38.488
if that's what you mean.

20:39.405 --> 20:40.990
The Rowans is a shithole.

20:41.741 --> 20:42.784
Your son's come.

20:43.952 --> 20:44.869
Hello, Dad.

20:46.245 --> 20:47.246
I'm not your dad.

20:48.289 --> 20:49.248
You my son?

20:50.041 --> 20:51.918
My son wears a suit.

20:52.001 --> 20:53.002
He doesn't recognise me.

20:53.419 --> 20:55.797
Well, they can be like that
when they've got an infection.

20:56.589 --> 20:59.050
There again,
perhaps he hasn't seen you in a while.

21:01.427 --> 21:02.512
You're nice and dry.

21:02.929 --> 21:04.305
I'm always nice and dry.

21:05.139 --> 21:06.474
It's my party piece.

21:08.977 --> 21:10.269
Well, you're not that far gone, then.

21:12.188 --> 21:14.607
I tell people you're...

21:14.899 --> 21:16.192
you're chauffeur driven.

21:21.656 --> 21:23.825
Jesus, Dad.

21:24.742 --> 21:27.161
Your chest sounds like wet gravel.

21:28.371 --> 21:30.289
What would you know about wet gravel?

21:31.124 --> 21:32.625
You never went down the pit.

21:33.543 --> 21:34.377
No,

21:35.378 --> 21:36.754
Mam didn't want me to.

21:38.339 --> 21:41.050
I didn't want you coming here in a pink

21:42.802 --> 21:46.931
singlet, looking like a Nancy.
But you did.

21:48.808 --> 21:51.519
It's not that
I was a naughty girl.

21:52.437 --> 21:54.397
You do understand, I'm sure.

21:54.897 --> 21:56.649
Those amongst you who have lived.

21:59.360 --> 22:00.445
Anyway, erm...

22:01.320 --> 22:03.156
-Mary.
-Oh, shh, shh.

22:04.991 --> 22:05.867
What's the matter?

22:06.367 --> 22:07.535
Haven't they asked you to join in?

22:08.411 --> 22:09.537
I don't want to join in.

22:11.164 --> 22:12.498
I don't have a lot to say.

22:12.749 --> 22:14.375
Comes from working in a library.

22:16.044 --> 22:17.712
You know, I have a passion for books, too.

22:17.837 --> 22:20.089
Oh, I didn't have a passion
for books.

22:20.840 --> 22:22.592
I just worked with them,
I kept them in order.

22:23.634 --> 22:25.053
With books, that's all that's required.

22:25.136 --> 22:26.345
They're not like people.

22:28.806 --> 22:30.975
I can still go in and introduce you.

22:31.434 --> 22:32.268
The men from the television

22:32.351 --> 22:33.936
would like to hear about your past career.

22:34.353 --> 22:36.397
No, if you push yourself forward,
you get seen.

22:36.731 --> 22:38.691
I thought,
as you were standing by the door...

22:39.192 --> 22:40.443
I'm not standing by the door.

22:41.778 --> 22:43.446
I've seen people standing by the door.

22:44.030 --> 22:46.574
They're either trying to escape,
or they're waiting for their mothers.

22:47.658 --> 22:49.952
Oh, I never stand by a door.
I make a point of it.

22:50.703 --> 22:54.248
Anyway, I went on
to marry three times,

22:54.332 --> 22:57.210
although I didn't enjoy
any of those marriages,

22:57.335 --> 22:58.294
not really.

23:05.301 --> 23:06.385
Have you brought me owt?

23:08.805 --> 23:09.639
No.

23:10.181 --> 23:11.265
Not even a grape?

23:11.349 --> 23:12.683
I couldn't think of what you'd want.

23:15.728 --> 23:16.771
A clean vest.

23:17.939 --> 23:19.273
When I was in once before,

23:19.398 --> 23:20.900
that's what your mam used to bring.

23:22.068 --> 23:23.111
And grapes.

23:24.445 --> 23:25.613
She was a good 'un.

23:27.907 --> 23:29.033
Yeah, she was.

23:30.493 --> 23:32.453
Until she put me in The Rowans.

23:32.578 --> 23:35.456
No, Dad. I put you in The Rowans.

23:36.374 --> 23:37.667
It's nowt to boast about.

23:37.792 --> 23:39.043
Well, you're forgetting, Dad.

23:39.127 --> 23:41.254
After Mam died,
you couldn't look after yourself.

23:41.420 --> 23:42.630
Or else you wouldn't.

23:43.673 --> 23:45.842
You didn't wash. You didn't eat.

23:46.759 --> 23:48.010
Used to wander the streets.

23:48.094 --> 23:50.596
I had the Miners' Benevolent
calling me up in London.

23:51.305 --> 23:52.849
I used to wander the streets?

23:55.309 --> 23:57.979
You were the one
who used to wander the sodding streets.

23:58.187 --> 23:59.689
Didn't get you put in a home.

24:00.356 --> 24:01.649
Should have got you arrested.

24:03.734 --> 24:05.111
It's what killed your mam.

24:16.247 --> 24:17.081
Er...

24:24.672 --> 24:26.549
Pills and potions to pop down 'em.

24:26.883 --> 24:28.467
-Mm-hm.
-Then I'm off.

24:29.969 --> 24:31.387
I don't know how you do it, Alma.

24:32.096 --> 24:33.055
Chopping and changing

24:33.181 --> 24:34.640
your earlies with your night shifts.

24:35.224 --> 24:37.602
I can't leave the cat
for a 12-hour stretch.

24:38.144 --> 24:39.979
I like being here both ends of the day.

24:40.563 --> 24:42.315
They're our most important times.

24:42.857 --> 24:44.609
You didn't write up that Mary Moss

24:44.692 --> 24:46.319
had an episode of incontinence.

24:46.527 --> 24:47.445
I asked you to.

24:48.237 --> 24:49.071
I'm sorry.

24:49.614 --> 24:51.199
I were hoping it were a one-off.

24:51.407 --> 24:52.867
It was certainly her first offence.

24:53.242 --> 24:54.744
Urine or faeces?

24:55.745 --> 24:56.621
Urine.

24:57.246 --> 24:58.414
With a little bit of faeces.

24:59.040 --> 25:01.918
Hmm. Well, I need to be
fully aware of these things.

25:02.043 --> 25:03.211
I run a clean ward.

25:03.419 --> 25:05.338
And a clean ward starts with a dry one.

25:06.505 --> 25:08.507
I'm sorry. She cried.

25:09.133 --> 25:11.594
When they're like that,
they're just like babies.

25:11.969 --> 25:13.930
Babies don't cry
when they mess themselves.

25:14.013 --> 25:15.139
Babies don't care.

25:16.349 --> 25:17.975
When old people don't care, do you cry?

25:19.185 --> 25:20.102
No.

25:21.896 --> 25:23.940
I think of them
running home from school.

25:25.399 --> 25:27.902
I think of them smiling
for their wedding photographs.

25:30.363 --> 25:32.114
From the cradle to the grave...

25:33.199 --> 25:35.451
...we have been the net
that holds them all.

25:36.661 --> 25:39.997
The playground falls,
the industrial injuries,

25:41.165 --> 25:43.501
their traffic accidents,
and their cancers.

25:44.627 --> 25:46.796
Even now, we fight the tide
on their behalf.

25:54.679 --> 25:57.890
They open their mouths
like birds, or children.

25:59.016 --> 26:00.935
They ask no questions about the dose.

26:01.852 --> 26:03.604
They do not query the side effects.

26:05.189 --> 26:06.899
We have promised them sleep,

26:07.233 --> 26:09.402
or peace of mind, or ease from pain.

26:10.611 --> 26:12.905
All the things they once
enjoyed without a thought,

26:13.030 --> 26:14.740
simply because they were not old.

26:16.367 --> 26:17.410
-And they believe us.
-

26:19.036 --> 26:20.121
That is our blessing.

26:21.497 --> 26:22.790
And if we should fail them,

26:24.208 --> 26:26.085
-it becomes their curse.

26:28.462 --> 26:30.548
It was my house.

26:32.425 --> 26:35.219
She was
in show business, apparently.

26:36.220 --> 26:38.389
You'd think she'd be more refined.

26:42.977 --> 26:45.730
Do you know? I sometimes think
this is my favourite time of the day.

26:46.522 --> 26:48.816
With you all tucked up and tidy,

26:49.483 --> 26:50.860
lathered in talcum.

26:51.360 --> 26:52.528
When everyone's asleep,

26:52.611 --> 26:54.739
you can hear the wind
on the moors from here.

26:56.240 --> 26:57.992
Did we have mince today?

26:58.326 --> 26:59.452
Turkey mince, aye.

27:00.411 --> 27:01.704
Keeps rifting up.

27:02.913 --> 27:04.123
Feel a bit wanny.

27:04.290 --> 27:05.958
I'll fetch you some
peppermint water and a bowl.

27:06.459 --> 27:07.460
I'll be back, Molly.

27:14.800 --> 27:15.718
Hello, stranger.

27:15.926 --> 27:17.887
It's only been a day, George.

27:19.138 --> 27:19.972
Hotel okay?

27:20.056 --> 27:21.891
Er, yeah, it's nice.

27:21.974 --> 27:23.476
They've put me in the wedding suite,

27:23.559 --> 27:26.103
which is, er, novel.

27:26.187 --> 27:27.605
How's your dad?

27:28.272 --> 27:30.232
Er, I've no idea how he is.

27:30.775 --> 27:32.568
Half dead, but keeps forgetting.

27:33.694 --> 27:35.780
I don't know what's good or bad
once they get to this age.

27:36.197 --> 27:37.990
Or how much he's putting it on.

27:39.075 --> 27:40.868
-And how's the hospital?
-Oh...

27:41.869 --> 27:42.703
It's like him.

27:42.787 --> 27:44.330
Half dead, but keeps forgetting.

27:45.623 --> 27:47.917
You will give your dad my love, won't you?

27:49.502 --> 27:50.544
Yeah, of course.

27:52.254 --> 27:53.881
He never knew what the hell
to do with mine.

28:06.977 --> 28:08.187
Excuse me, mate.
Are those grapes?

28:09.438 --> 28:11.023
-Yes.
-Get them in shot, the grapes.

28:11.690 --> 28:13.609
Hi, mate. Do you mind coming in again

28:13.734 --> 28:15.152
and holding the grapes a bit higher?

28:16.862 --> 28:18.948
It's just we need
a shot of visitors coming in,

28:19.031 --> 28:20.658
and the grapes look really good.

28:20.783 --> 28:22.743
What do you need a shot
of visitors arriving for?

28:23.452 --> 28:25.329
I'm sorry. Abdul, Pennine People.

28:25.413 --> 28:26.747
We're making a short documentary...

28:26.831 --> 28:28.207
-Mr Colman?
-Yeah.

28:29.125 --> 28:30.543
Apologies for my tardiness

28:30.668 --> 28:32.503
in offering you a personal welcome.

28:33.295 --> 28:36.215
I've arranged for coffee
to be served in the boardroom.

28:37.049 --> 28:40.302
So, a news and documentary
segment for Pennine People

28:40.386 --> 28:42.012
on the Save The Beth campaign.

28:42.138 --> 28:44.181
Well, I'll have to inform the Minister.

28:44.432 --> 28:46.183
Well, we are out to raise awareness.

28:46.642 --> 28:48.060
And they're lapping it up locally.

28:48.811 --> 28:50.521
This hospital isn't funded locally.

28:51.689 --> 28:53.357
Well, we are in control of our own money.

28:54.108 --> 28:55.484
Where do you get that money from?

28:56.068 --> 28:59.655
Spiritually? Aneurin Bevan, circa 1947.

28:59.947 --> 29:02.867
And fiscally, Whitehall, circa now.

29:03.159 --> 29:04.243
Until we say stop.

29:04.368 --> 29:06.203
No, people aren't gonna let you say stop.

29:06.912 --> 29:09.123
You've been dismembering
this hospital for years,

29:09.415 --> 29:11.375
limb by separately amputated limb.

29:11.584 --> 29:13.961
They have to go to Doncaster
for cataracts now.

29:14.336 --> 29:17.798
And Pontefract for audiology.
And that's a complicated bus.

29:18.048 --> 29:21.343
People voted this government in.

29:21.635 --> 29:24.597
They can skydive out of
as many planes as they like.

29:24.680 --> 29:27.099
They chose this. They chose efficiency.

29:27.683 --> 29:29.935
They chose centres of excellence.

29:30.019 --> 29:31.645
The Beth delivers neither.

29:31.729 --> 29:34.940
We could be a centre
of excellence for geriatrics.

29:35.399 --> 29:36.692
But you're trying to shut us down.

29:36.817 --> 29:39.361
Effective management is target focused,
outcome driven.

29:39.445 --> 29:41.030
You set a goal, and you go for it.

29:41.113 --> 29:43.491
Geriatrics is a waiting game.

29:43.616 --> 29:46.869
It's ungovernable, open-ended,
resource-intensive.

29:46.952 --> 29:50.623
-It makes zero economic sense.

29:50.831 --> 29:51.707
I disagree.

29:52.958 --> 29:54.585
The future is old age.

29:55.336 --> 29:56.170
Everybody knows that.

29:56.253 --> 29:58.631
The people running raffles
in the foyer know that.

29:59.590 --> 30:00.716
They want The Beth.

30:01.258 --> 30:04.678
They want small-scale, local, caring care.

30:04.803 --> 30:07.223
They want something that's over.

30:08.349 --> 30:09.266
Gone.

30:09.850 --> 30:11.185
Because it didn't work.

30:11.268 --> 30:14.063
And if they keep dragging us backwards,

30:14.563 --> 30:17.191
there will be no progress.

30:18.359 --> 30:20.903
  What do you think
is the most important thing in The Beth?

30:22.112 --> 30:23.489
-The patients

30:25.074 --> 30:26.033
  and the coffee machine.

30:28.244 --> 30:30.371
  Yeah, definitely the coffee machine.

30:32.206 --> 30:33.499
  Non-slip flooring.

30:33.874 --> 30:36.252
  As a physio, I just don't really think
you can put a price on that,

30:37.711 --> 30:38.879
  if I'm completely honest.

30:39.421 --> 30:42.007
  Oh, well, the most important thing isn't,

30:42.299 --> 30:44.802
  er, isn't really a thing, is it? It's a...

30:45.261 --> 30:47.304
  It's a spirit. An essence. It's, er...

30:47.596 --> 30:49.974
  Maybe if you try
to say that in just one word.

30:52.226 --> 30:53.060
  Erm...

30:54.228 --> 30:55.104
  Pluck.

30:55.980 --> 30:56.855
  The grub.

30:57.648 --> 31:00.192
  A lovely big bath, with handles.

31:00.943 --> 31:02.069
  The volunteers.

31:02.820 --> 31:04.863
  -Are we allowed to say that?
-

31:05.906 --> 31:06.865
  In one word?

31:08.242 --> 31:09.159
  The exit.

31:10.244 --> 31:12.871
  Although, if we're being punctilious,
that's two.

31:13.789 --> 31:16.041
  -I like him.

31:17.543 --> 31:18.460
  The smell.

31:19.670 --> 31:21.964
  Or, to be more precise, the lack of one.

31:29.221 --> 31:30.472
Dr Valentine.

31:31.890 --> 31:32.725
Yes, Mary?

31:34.476 --> 31:36.854
I wasn't entirely transparent

31:38.147 --> 31:41.734
when we had our discourse about passion.

31:44.278 --> 31:46.780
There was something
about books that excited me.

31:48.115 --> 31:49.199
Marginalia.

31:51.076 --> 31:51.910
Marginalia?

31:53.746 --> 31:57.041
The things that readers write
at the edges of the page.

31:57.207 --> 32:00.711
They make little notes
about things that strike them.

32:00.794 --> 32:03.130
Words that have meaning, or weight.

32:04.465 --> 32:08.719
Sometimes a cross is deemed
sufficient to mark the spot,

32:08.802 --> 32:09.887
but not always.

32:11.930 --> 32:14.391
I was supposed to rub them out
if they were in pencil.

32:16.226 --> 32:18.604
But sometimes, I left them.

32:20.898 --> 32:22.149
They might be there still.

32:24.610 --> 32:26.028
That is rather a nice thought.

32:27.279 --> 32:30.032
Hmm. Might be a wicked one,
for all you know.

32:34.119 --> 32:35.496
There are too many Marys.

32:36.455 --> 32:39.792
Pushed to the margins,
not part of the story,

32:39.875 --> 32:42.503
doomed to be rubbed out,
to leave no trace.

32:44.588 --> 32:45.881
I want them to matter.

32:46.757 --> 32:48.842
I want them to get the best from us.

32:49.551 --> 32:51.595
For us to deliver what we promise.

32:52.721 --> 32:53.722
What they need.

32:55.391 --> 32:56.392
And every day,

32:57.434 --> 32:58.852
I fear that we are failing.

33:01.021 --> 33:04.441
I don't think Sister Gilpin
is gonna like this at all.

33:04.525 --> 33:07.444
The bonbons are bordering
on the froufrou.

33:08.070 --> 33:11.073
And she's got extremely hard hands.

33:11.323 --> 33:13.283
Well, I think
she's going to love everything.

33:13.784 --> 33:16.286
The banners, the balloons,
the cake, and the singing.

33:16.745 --> 33:18.288
The Beth has been her life.

33:18.372 --> 33:21.875
She's done nothing whatsoever
to deserve the singing.

33:22.960 --> 33:26.088
Well, I don't sing for her anyway.

33:26.505 --> 33:27.673
I sing for you.

33:27.756 --> 33:31.009
And I've done absolutely
nothing to deserve it either.

33:31.093 --> 33:35.013
Well, you wouldn't say that
if I was Dorothy Squires.

33:35.097 --> 33:38.267
I'd say that if you were
Kiri Te fucking Kanawa!

33:38.475 --> 33:39.560
That's terrible!

33:39.768 --> 33:42.187
Well, it's a tmesis.

33:42.271 --> 33:44.314
Sounds all right in his accent.

33:44.940 --> 33:47.192
What is a tmesis, Ambrose?

33:47.276 --> 33:50.028
Er, it's a grammatical construction.

33:50.529 --> 33:53.532
"Abso-fucking-lutely"
would be another example.

33:53.866 --> 33:55.284
You're not to put that on your film.

33:55.492 --> 33:57.661
Come and do a close-up of the handicrafts.

33:57.995 --> 33:59.997
-Ambrose, would, erm...
-Hmm.

34:00.831 --> 34:04.501
..."fish 'n' chips" and "rock 'n' roll"

34:04.918 --> 34:07.004
also be examples of this grammar?

34:07.087 --> 34:10.466
No, they would be examples of an enclitic.

34:10.716 --> 34:12.718
-A shortened version of "and".
-Mm-hm.

34:14.011 --> 34:15.929
And the other is tmesis?

34:16.180 --> 34:17.014
Tmesis, yes.

34:17.097 --> 34:19.141
Are you studying for an examination?

34:20.684 --> 34:21.852
It's, er, an interview.

34:22.770 --> 34:24.688
I have applied for UK nationality.

34:25.481 --> 34:27.941
-And English is like medicine.
-Ah.

34:28.066 --> 34:29.443
There is always something new to learn.

34:44.708 --> 34:46.043
I hope they're seedless.

34:47.336 --> 34:49.922
Pips get stuck underneath me plate.

34:51.715 --> 34:52.591
Hello, Dad.

34:53.550 --> 34:54.510
Did you sleep well?

34:55.511 --> 34:57.971
I kept having to ring
the buzzer for the lav.

34:59.640 --> 35:01.183
But I'm in the Sister's good books,

35:01.308 --> 35:03.143
because I sing out. Yeah.

35:04.061 --> 35:06.522
Urination's a religion with her.

35:06.939 --> 35:07.773
Oh.

35:08.524 --> 35:09.525
You do look better.

35:10.567 --> 35:12.653
It... It's deceptive.

35:17.199 --> 35:19.785
I'm not better enough
to go back to The Rowans.

35:27.501 --> 35:29.586
Did you stay with your Auntie Violet?

35:30.754 --> 35:32.589
No. She's been dead three years.

35:34.007 --> 35:36.426
Well, I... I can't remember everything.

35:36.510 --> 35:37.344
No.

35:41.932 --> 35:43.392
I stayed at a new hotel.

35:44.518 --> 35:45.519
York House.

35:47.688 --> 35:48.522
That...

35:49.565 --> 35:51.483
used to be a bank.

35:53.610 --> 35:54.695
I remember that.

35:59.992 --> 36:01.201
I've just found this

36:02.077 --> 36:03.704
underneath my mother's bedspread.

36:05.247 --> 36:07.875
We have discussed the fact
that your mother is incontinent.

36:09.877 --> 36:11.169
It's Angel Delight.

36:11.420 --> 36:12.838
Butterscotch, by the looks of it.

36:13.005 --> 36:14.214
Complete with spoon.

36:14.631 --> 36:16.633
Now when my mother
starts squirrelling away food,

36:16.717 --> 36:18.302
it means she's upset.

36:18.552 --> 36:20.804
And what I want to know
is why is she upset?

36:21.096 --> 36:22.723
Possibly because she's incontinent,

36:22.806 --> 36:25.017
and confused, and has gallstones.

36:25.559 --> 36:27.060
No, she's upset because you've put her

36:27.144 --> 36:29.438
in a geriatric ward, that's why!

36:29.605 --> 36:30.981
Every patient on my ward

36:31.106 --> 36:32.649
is much the same age as your mother.

36:34.067 --> 36:36.028
And as it happens, we've several younger.

36:37.112 --> 36:39.406
Well, they obviously haven't
looked after themselves.

36:39.740 --> 36:42.451
Or been looked after
by somebody who cares.

36:45.203 --> 36:46.038
We care.

36:48.582 --> 36:49.541
Constantly.

36:53.712 --> 36:55.339
No, I've no news on beds.

36:56.089 --> 36:57.758
This is the middle of a working day.

37:07.351 --> 37:10.479
A whole camera, hidden inside there?

37:10.562 --> 37:12.898
Yeah, you can take
still pictures, or a video.

37:12.981 --> 37:14.399
And, as I've explained,

37:14.816 --> 37:16.944
then the filmmakers might use your footage

37:17.027 --> 37:18.028
in their documentary.

37:19.237 --> 37:21.531
It's no thicker than a monthly periodical.

37:23.617 --> 37:25.452
-Has it got a mouse?

37:25.827 --> 37:27.120
You don't need a mouse, Mary.

37:27.245 --> 37:29.873
Everything is operated
via the touch screen.

37:29.957 --> 37:33.293
Now, swipe on the icon,
like we did before.

37:33.377 --> 37:35.629
With greater gentleness
as though you've seen

37:35.712 --> 37:38.966
a speck of dust and wish to brush it away.

37:40.926 --> 37:41.927
-Oh.
-Ah!

37:42.010 --> 37:43.512
You'll put us all out of a job.

37:44.096 --> 37:45.263
I said that to my computer

37:45.347 --> 37:47.557
the day they digitalised the library.

37:48.225 --> 37:50.394
I was at the forefront of modernisation.

37:52.646 --> 37:54.898
What... What do you wish me to record?

37:55.941 --> 37:57.401
Well, the filmmakers say

37:57.567 --> 37:59.277
they simply want your point of view.

38:00.195 --> 38:02.781
For you to record what you see,

38:02.864 --> 38:05.158
to tell them what your life is like.

38:08.161 --> 38:09.955
I could tell you something
about that chair.

38:10.622 --> 38:11.581
Only I won't.

38:19.256 --> 38:20.090
Come here.

38:34.646 --> 38:36.940
-You caught me red-handed.

38:37.065 --> 38:39.234
Two hours to turn around
before my night shift,

38:39.401 --> 38:40.944
tucking into sweet and sour pork.

38:41.445 --> 38:42.279
Shocking.

38:42.362 --> 38:43.947
Oh, why shouldn't you treat yourself?

38:44.489 --> 38:46.700
Mine is a deep fried tofu
in black bean sauce.

38:46.783 --> 38:48.744
-Ooh.
-Hmm.

38:49.911 --> 38:51.913
Do you know, I get
substantial discount over there.

38:52.247 --> 38:55.167
I saw their granddad through
a rather nasty gastric cancer.

38:55.333 --> 38:56.585
Oh. How... How did he do?

38:56.835 --> 38:58.003
Deceased. Yeah.

38:58.712 --> 39:00.130
Well, he was lucky we found him a bed.

39:00.213 --> 39:03.216
I mean, at his age, he'd either
choke on his own blood at The Royal

39:03.300 --> 39:05.010
or be bussed off to some council home

39:05.093 --> 39:06.553
where they've no knack with the morphine.

39:06.636 --> 39:07.471
-Hmm.
-Hmm.

39:09.097 --> 39:10.390
I mean, all these managers,

39:10.849 --> 39:13.101
all they ever think about
is movement, isn't it?

39:13.935 --> 39:17.064
Like the hospital system
is just some giant bowel

39:17.147 --> 39:19.024
that has to keep pumping out shit.

39:20.317 --> 39:21.693
-But it isn't, is it, Dr Val?
-Hmm.

39:23.278 --> 39:25.739
It's about getting the patient
to the right place, at the right time.

39:28.033 --> 39:28.992
And to the best,

39:29.117 --> 39:31.119
most appropriate bed that can be found.

39:31.953 --> 39:33.914
Don't talk to me about beds.

39:34.372 --> 39:35.999
I deal in beds the way some other folk

39:36.083 --> 39:37.209
deal in used hatchbacks.

39:38.418 --> 39:40.796
-Well, I dream about beds.
-Ah.

39:40.921 --> 39:42.881
Yeah, sometimes they're just
beds that I want to lie in

39:42.964 --> 39:44.007
and go to sleep for days,

39:44.091 --> 39:46.510
but mostly, they are for other people.

39:47.094 --> 39:50.013
For people who need them,
to be healed in, or to die.

39:50.597 --> 39:51.431
Hmm.

39:52.265 --> 39:54.601
-Empty?
-Oh, they're always empty

39:55.268 --> 39:56.103
'cause I am dreaming.

40:02.609 --> 40:04.277
Dr Val, can I share a worry with you?

40:06.863 --> 40:07.948
Most certainly. Yeah.

40:10.033 --> 40:12.953
It's about my speech, you know,
for the medal presentation.

40:15.914 --> 40:18.416
I don't know what to put.
I don't know what to say.

40:19.501 --> 40:21.837
I'm a woman of deeds,
not a woman of words.

40:23.922 --> 40:27.092
Well, I would advise you
to speak from the heart.

40:29.803 --> 40:30.679
Oh.

40:33.014 --> 40:34.641
All I can think of to say is,

40:36.184 --> 40:37.811
"Don't leave it too late to die."

40:49.406 --> 40:50.574
All right, twat face?

40:51.283 --> 40:52.159
How is it going?

40:52.659 --> 40:54.911
Yeah. Dad will pull through.

40:55.996 --> 40:57.205
The hospital won't.

40:57.289 --> 40:59.708
Although I'm struggling
to convince the Chair of that.

41:00.000 --> 41:01.209
Hmm, that's not like you.

41:01.960 --> 41:05.589
I tried.
But he got the best cups out.

41:07.382 --> 41:09.342
And something
about the place is working.

41:10.135 --> 41:11.261
Must be, otherwise my dad

41:11.344 --> 41:13.054
wouldn't have developed a pantomime cough

41:13.180 --> 41:14.848
out of terror they'll discharge him.

41:16.099 --> 41:18.977
Yet there are less beds than ever,

41:19.060 --> 41:21.271
and money is still swirling down the pan.

41:22.355 --> 41:23.481
You sound tired.

41:23.607 --> 41:25.192
Yes, George.

41:26.276 --> 41:28.904
I am tired. Bloody tired.

41:29.738 --> 41:30.572
I love you.

41:31.990 --> 41:32.949
I know you do.

41:36.119 --> 41:37.579
There are other responses.

41:41.166 --> 41:42.083
All right.

41:43.877 --> 41:45.879
You too, you too.

42:00.352 --> 42:02.604
I may well have
24 beds under my jurisdiction,

42:02.687 --> 42:04.856
and every single one of them is occupied.

42:06.983 --> 42:08.860
It's carnage incarnate down The Royal,

42:08.944 --> 42:10.153
and now at the Infirmary.

42:10.570 --> 42:11.738
Begging for beds again?

42:11.821 --> 42:14.741
Hmm, they're failing to hit
their targets, apparently.

42:15.909 --> 42:18.453
Oh, I'll have to give
Snowdrop Court a ring again,

42:18.536 --> 42:19.913
see if we can move somebody there.

42:20.789 --> 42:22.999
Or throw myself on the mercy
of Green Lawns.

42:23.166 --> 42:25.293
Green Lawns? Is it that bad?

42:26.711 --> 42:28.380
I need a black coffee. Two sugars.

42:45.230 --> 42:46.356
What's on the trolley?

42:48.733 --> 42:49.693
You got any cigs?

42:51.111 --> 42:52.570
I've got large-print books.

42:53.029 --> 42:54.155
It's no smoking in here.

42:55.448 --> 42:56.366
Live a little.

42:57.033 --> 42:58.159
I'm on work experience.

42:58.243 --> 43:00.870
And I've been assigned
to wheel you to the shower later.

43:00.954 --> 43:03.206
They'd have had you down a coal mine once.

43:04.874 --> 43:06.876
Have you had sexual intercourse yet?

43:09.045 --> 43:10.297
Yeah, loads of times.

43:10.380 --> 43:11.631
What do you reckon to it?

43:13.174 --> 43:14.009
It's all right.

43:15.093 --> 43:16.678
Do you want to feel my feet?

43:18.972 --> 43:20.181
It wouldn't be top of my list.

43:20.974 --> 43:23.310
Not in a mucky way. In a medical way.

43:23.393 --> 43:24.519
They keep swelling up.

43:25.145 --> 43:26.604
Oh, well, they look all right from here.

43:27.981 --> 43:30.608
Improvement is not in my best interest.

43:33.570 --> 43:35.030
It's Mr Colman, isn't it?

43:36.281 --> 43:37.449
May I join you?

43:38.241 --> 43:39.117
Yeah.

43:42.954 --> 43:45.081
I was with your father earlier.

43:45.832 --> 43:46.958
He's very proud of you.

43:49.502 --> 43:50.587
That's news to me.

43:52.130 --> 43:53.006
That's fathers.

43:56.259 --> 43:58.970
Mr Colman, may I show you something?

44:01.222 --> 44:02.932
They closed this ward six months ago.

44:04.642 --> 44:07.062
Closure was financially appropriate.

44:07.896 --> 44:08.730
Look at this.

44:09.773 --> 44:10.648
Tell me what you see.

44:13.360 --> 44:14.235
A bed.

44:15.779 --> 44:18.156
It's a way out of A & E
when somebody has fallen.

44:20.200 --> 44:21.534
It comes with oxygen,

44:21.785 --> 44:25.121
with intravenous pain relief
for broken bones.

44:25.955 --> 44:29.125
It comes equipped with hoists,
with air flow mattresses,

44:29.250 --> 44:32.379
a hook for catheters,
a bell to summon help.

44:34.130 --> 44:37.634
It carries on its shoulders
care assistants, porters, nurses,

44:38.593 --> 44:43.056
anaesthetists, junior doctors,
housemen, a consultant.

44:43.973 --> 44:44.808
And stretching ahead

44:44.891 --> 44:47.018
are all the possibilities
recovery entails.

44:47.894 --> 44:48.770
Such as?

44:49.104 --> 44:51.398
Occupational therapists and dieticians.

44:52.148 --> 44:55.068
Physios and phlebotomists.
District nurses.

44:56.903 --> 44:58.071
When somebody gets a bed,

44:58.446 --> 45:00.615
they get so much more
than a piece of furniture.

45:01.908 --> 45:03.159
They get everything we are.

45:05.578 --> 45:06.830
Well, if you put it that way.

45:08.540 --> 45:09.499
But at what cost?

45:10.875 --> 45:14.546
The cost is not exorbitant.
The cost is nothing.

45:14.671 --> 45:16.423
Money isn't exactly your strong suit,

45:17.257 --> 45:18.299
is it, Dr Valentine?

45:20.510 --> 45:22.011
It isn't the thing I think of first.

45:29.769 --> 45:30.770
What you up to, Joe?

45:32.480 --> 45:34.732
Trying to get these the right way round.

45:36.484 --> 45:37.569
I was, er,

45:38.445 --> 45:41.072
a banksman at the pit.

45:41.239 --> 45:43.700
I'd give the men their tally
afore they went down,

45:43.783 --> 45:46.161
and they'd hand them back
when they came up safe.

45:47.162 --> 45:48.246
I remember them as much

45:48.371 --> 45:50.415
by their numbers as by their names.

45:51.291 --> 45:52.167
Joe, love.

45:53.168 --> 45:56.671
Dr Valentine thinks it might be better
if we took your wedding ring off.

45:58.631 --> 45:59.591
Better for who?

46:00.300 --> 46:01.134
Well, you.

46:01.718 --> 46:02.760
Your fingers keep puffing up

46:02.844 --> 46:04.637
because your circulation's not behaving.

46:06.055 --> 46:06.890
I'm...

46:07.599 --> 46:09.309
I'm on tablets for that.

46:09.642 --> 46:11.978
Yeah, and if they work,
you can have your ring back.

46:12.312 --> 46:13.605
I'll just need to nip it in half

46:14.189 --> 46:15.482
with a little pair of pliers.

46:16.274 --> 46:18.109
You bloody don't!

46:18.443 --> 46:21.070
Stopping where it is.
Where it's always been.

46:21.488 --> 46:24.324
I have never, ever taken it off. Never.

46:25.825 --> 46:27.243
It's for the good of your health, Joe.

46:27.410 --> 46:30.997
You can sod off with your sodding pliers.

46:31.122 --> 46:32.081
Leave me be.

46:32.415 --> 46:33.249
All right.

46:34.083 --> 46:35.126
Shower time.

46:42.050 --> 46:43.092
Jesus wept.

46:49.265 --> 46:51.267
Right, first,
I'm gonna take your trousers off.

46:52.018 --> 46:53.853
I bet you've said that a few times.

46:54.020 --> 46:56.356
I've got no interest in your penis.

46:57.273 --> 46:58.691
You're not in any danger.

46:59.108 --> 47:00.401
These days, it's swelling

47:00.485 --> 47:02.737
-the ranks of the unemployed.

47:02.904 --> 47:04.906
Oh, sorry. I'm just looking for my father.

47:09.369 --> 47:11.412
He has no interest in my penis either.

47:15.041 --> 47:17.210
Nobody told me
Joan Collins was a bathroom.

47:18.002 --> 47:19.754
Sister Face Ache says
you're to go back in,

47:20.004 --> 47:21.506
sit in a corner and make small talk

47:21.589 --> 47:22.840
because nobody likes to feel

47:22.924 --> 47:24.342
they cause revulsion in a loved one.

47:24.425 --> 47:26.844
It's not revulsion. It's pity.

47:27.470 --> 47:28.346
Is that better?

47:39.524 --> 47:40.900
-He's back.

47:42.652 --> 47:45.738
You're gonna mark the floor
with those shoes.

47:46.281 --> 47:48.324
And I'm not having anyone
saying it was me.

47:49.117 --> 47:51.786
I don't leave marks. I'm a very clean man.

47:51.869 --> 47:54.080
And you'll be all the cleaner
when I've finished with you.

47:54.789 --> 47:56.708
Are you suggesting I do it in my trousers?

47:56.791 --> 47:57.917
Because I never do.

47:58.751 --> 48:00.712
I always sing out when I need to go.

48:01.462 --> 48:02.839
- You're a model.
-Yes.

48:02.922 --> 48:04.299
Otherwise
you'd be on me blacklist.

48:05.091 --> 48:05.967
Now...

48:06.801 --> 48:07.719
Now, is that better?

48:08.720 --> 48:09.679
I smell better.

48:10.972 --> 48:11.848
So, what do you say?

48:12.724 --> 48:14.851
We don't say anything. It's your job.

48:15.435 --> 48:16.269
Dad!

48:16.686 --> 48:18.062
Oh, it speaks.

48:20.732 --> 48:22.650
His feet look swollen.

48:23.610 --> 48:25.028
That's inactivity.

48:25.820 --> 48:26.904
We've a remedy for that.

48:33.870 --> 48:34.829
Right, stop there.

48:44.297 --> 48:45.840
Right, let's get you vertical.

48:46.215 --> 48:47.091
Eh?

48:47.175 --> 48:49.844
He can't stand up.
Dad, you know you can't.

48:53.348 --> 48:54.182
Come towards me.

48:55.475 --> 48:58.227
You're pushing on an open door
with a bossa nova.

48:59.312 --> 49:01.522
You know, sometimes,
even when people can't walk,

49:01.606 --> 49:02.482
they can dance.

49:03.399 --> 49:04.692
We presume it's the music.

49:05.902 --> 49:09.405
Unlocking some long-lost
pattern in the brain.

49:10.073 --> 49:10.990
Wait...

49:11.157 --> 49:13.368
Wait till I tell
Gorgeous Gerald about this.

49:14.786 --> 49:15.620
That's it.

49:18.247 --> 49:20.958
Slow. Quick, quick, slow.

49:25.588 --> 49:26.422
Hey,

49:26.881 --> 49:28.591
you're champion at this, you are.

49:30.051 --> 49:32.261
Well, not an actual champion.

49:32.512 --> 49:35.807
I was an actual champion, with his mam.

49:36.933 --> 49:38.142
We won a cup once

49:38.976 --> 49:41.854
at a holiday camp in Filey.

49:42.021 --> 49:43.690
-Ooh!
-It was Scarborough.

49:44.691 --> 49:45.817
Can you dance too?

49:46.651 --> 49:47.485
No.

49:48.236 --> 49:50.905
-He sings.
- I used to.

49:51.906 --> 49:53.908
You had the voice of an angel.

49:56.035 --> 49:57.120
All right. Come on.

49:57.537 --> 49:58.371
Hang on a minute.

50:00.707 --> 50:02.166
-There we go.

50:04.752 --> 50:05.586
Go on...

50:06.003 --> 50:06.963
-...sing.

50:08.131 --> 50:10.091
I can't remember any songs.

50:11.050 --> 50:13.970
Give us  Blow the Wind Southerly.

50:14.220 --> 50:15.430
Bring the house down.

50:16.806 --> 50:17.640
No.

50:20.351 --> 50:23.604
Well, that's your
entertainment over and out

50:25.773 --> 50:28.067
because I've finished
performing for one day.

50:29.152 --> 50:30.570
And I need the lav.

50:31.112 --> 50:31.946
Come on.

50:32.447 --> 50:33.656
And it was Filey.

50:35.074 --> 50:35.992
Scarborough.

50:39.871 --> 50:43.249
Mavis, do you remember eyebrows?

50:44.917 --> 50:45.835
Vaguely.

50:46.919 --> 50:48.379
Where do you suppose they go?

50:49.422 --> 50:52.175
They take up residence inside men's ears.

50:52.467 --> 50:53.301
Oh.

50:54.844 --> 50:57.388
I was sat next to Ambrose
in choir the other day,

50:57.472 --> 50:59.432
and you've never seen so much hair

50:59.515 --> 51:01.184
as he's got down his lughole.

51:02.393 --> 51:04.061
What are you playing at, Mary?

51:05.688 --> 51:08.274
I'm familiarising myself with the iPad.

51:09.734 --> 51:12.445
The young men are keen
to receive my impressions

51:13.154 --> 51:14.322
for their documentary.

51:14.906 --> 51:16.282
I've got carte blanche

51:17.408 --> 51:19.577
as long as I've got something
sensible on my feet.

51:29.295 --> 51:31.547
Signal's best if you go round the kitchen
and stand on the bins.

51:32.965 --> 51:33.841
All right.

51:34.592 --> 51:35.968
No, I was just heading off, actually.

51:40.223 --> 51:41.349
Thanks for what you're doing for my dad.

51:42.892 --> 51:43.810
That doesn't look easy.

51:45.978 --> 51:47.021
I'll be out of here next week.

51:47.647 --> 51:48.523
Huh.

51:49.774 --> 51:50.691
What are you looking at?

51:52.985 --> 51:53.945
It's your bike.

51:55.112 --> 51:56.155
Well, it's a rubbish bike.

51:57.698 --> 51:59.283
Rubbish? No.

52:00.743 --> 52:01.911
I had one just like that once.

52:02.995 --> 52:04.288
You're in my good books today.

52:05.206 --> 52:07.667
A very nice bit of self-directed physio

52:08.000 --> 52:09.877
and some immaculate bladder management.

52:10.002 --> 52:11.254
When...

52:11.546 --> 52:14.173
When was I in your bad book?

52:14.549 --> 52:15.466
Well, you haven't been yet.

52:16.551 --> 52:18.636
That said, I do keep tabs on people.

52:20.721 --> 52:21.848
I had

52:23.307 --> 52:25.309
tabs on people once.

52:29.105 --> 52:31.816
I used to be a tally man down the pit.

52:34.402 --> 52:36.529
Every shift I'd... I'd... I'd...

52:36.779 --> 52:39.490
I'd count the men down and, er,

52:41.200 --> 52:42.326
I'd count them up again.

52:44.495 --> 52:45.454
I had the list.

52:46.747 --> 52:47.748
And the... And the list

52:48.708 --> 52:50.334
could mean the difference between

52:50.710 --> 52:53.796
life and the reverse.

52:53.963 --> 52:54.797
Well, come along.

52:54.922 --> 52:56.132
You've done enough for one day.

52:56.424 --> 52:58.426
Save the past for reminiscence therapy.

53:13.608 --> 53:14.483
What job do you do?

53:16.152 --> 53:17.486
I'm a management consultant.

53:19.530 --> 53:20.573
What, is that computers?

53:21.657 --> 53:23.409
Eh. Yes and no.

53:25.369 --> 53:26.287
They're just a tool.

53:28.956 --> 53:29.916
What's London like?

53:33.628 --> 53:34.462
Better.

53:35.129 --> 53:37.214
Better. Better clubs and all that?

53:37.715 --> 53:39.216
Yeah, better clubs and all that.

53:40.217 --> 53:43.179
Better food. Better weather.
Better prospects.

53:43.930 --> 53:46.307
Worse traffic, but can't have everything.

53:51.062 --> 53:51.979
You should try it.

53:53.272 --> 53:54.106
Go.

53:55.066 --> 53:56.359
Just for a week, a day.

54:00.321 --> 54:01.155
I might.

54:04.367 --> 54:05.201
I did.

54:17.004 --> 54:17.880
Mr Colman?

54:20.174 --> 54:23.094
Nurse Pinkney said you were unhappy
about having your wedding ring removed?

54:26.138 --> 54:28.599
I was unhappy about having it cut off.

54:29.934 --> 54:32.311
A ring is round,

54:32.395 --> 54:33.604
it has no end. If you...

54:34.021 --> 54:35.439
If you cut it off, it's finished.

54:36.941 --> 54:37.942
May I see it?

54:42.947 --> 54:44.115
Your fingers are swollen, Joe.

54:45.491 --> 54:46.534
This will fluctuate,

54:46.617 --> 54:48.494
but my worry is that
should things get worse,

54:48.577 --> 54:51.080
rather than better,
you could be in real pain.

54:52.748 --> 54:54.333
The ring may cut off your blood flow.

54:58.587 --> 54:59.964
It were never that comfy.

55:00.631 --> 55:02.758
I'll soldier on with it.

55:05.011 --> 55:06.220
I brought some grease.

55:06.887 --> 55:08.639
Will you let me try
and remove it that way?

55:11.684 --> 55:12.601
I fell.

55:13.060 --> 55:15.021
I know, love. You fractured your ankle.

55:17.064 --> 55:18.190
It was mine.

55:19.275 --> 55:20.735
It's gonna feel a little bit numb

55:20.818 --> 55:22.028
until the boot comes off.

55:25.156 --> 55:27.158
It was my house.

55:28.617 --> 55:30.828
But we can start you with the physio soon.

55:30.911 --> 55:33.622
You'll like him.
We call him Gorgeous Gerald.

55:35.541 --> 55:36.417
Come on, sweetheart.

55:37.668 --> 55:38.794
Come on. Up we come.

55:53.184 --> 55:54.018
All done.

55:56.896 --> 55:57.772
There.

55:59.106 --> 55:59.940
Oh.

56:02.568 --> 56:03.444
Thank you.

56:04.695 --> 56:05.613
All gone.

56:07.239 --> 56:08.115
Lovely job.

56:13.162 --> 56:14.997
All together, everybody.

56:15.289 --> 56:17.666
Good morning, good morning

56:18.042 --> 56:20.002
We've danced
the whole night through

56:20.086 --> 56:22.922
Good morning,
good morning to you

56:23.005 --> 56:23.881
Lovely.

56:24.173 --> 56:25.341
Deep breaths now.

56:25.674 --> 56:28.427
Now, see if you can move your arms.

56:29.095 --> 56:30.471
Wonderful, Mavis.

56:30.554 --> 56:32.348
Good morning to you

56:32.431 --> 56:36.852
And remember, everyone,
we're being our best selves.

56:37.019 --> 56:38.312
The moon was shining bright

56:38.729 --> 56:40.981
Now the milkman's on his way

56:41.190 --> 56:42.566
It's too late to say goodnight

56:42.650 --> 56:44.819
Lively, Mary. Think sunshine.

56:44.902 --> 56:45.945
Good morning

56:46.070 --> 56:48.114
Sunbeams will soon shine through

56:48.239 --> 56:52.576
Good morning,
good morning to you

56:52.660 --> 56:54.161
-  Lovely.

56:54.245 --> 56:55.204
- Oh.

56:55.788 --> 56:58.415
All she had to do
was stay alive.

56:59.416 --> 57:01.127
All you had to do was keep her that way!

57:01.210 --> 57:03.754
Well, I...
I think you're mistaking my position.

57:04.380 --> 57:05.256
Thanks.

57:06.215 --> 57:08.217
Chairman of the Board is, erm,

57:09.135 --> 57:11.554
well, it's an honorary role.

57:11.887 --> 57:14.181
Alive. For three more months.

57:14.932 --> 57:17.434
I'm... I'm told your mother was,

57:17.852 --> 57:19.145
well, 92.

57:19.228 --> 57:20.437
Yeah. Well,

57:21.355 --> 57:24.400
the  Express   says that 90 is the new 70.

57:26.068 --> 57:27.403
We want a post mortem.

57:27.653 --> 57:28.571
-Oh, er...

57:29.280 --> 57:30.739
Sorry, you said
we could film in here today...

57:30.823 --> 57:32.074
Oh. No, no, no, not just now. No, erm...

57:32.158 --> 57:34.743
Look, you're intruding on...
on private grief.

57:34.827 --> 57:37.496
Actually... Actually,
they can come right in.

57:37.663 --> 57:39.665
There'll be nothing private about my grief

57:39.832 --> 57:41.625
when The Beth's had up in court!

57:41.834 --> 57:43.586
-Oh, please, please!

57:43.919 --> 57:45.629
These people are heartbroken!

57:46.046 --> 57:47.673
Oh. Your mother's physician.

57:48.007 --> 57:49.550
Hey, erm...

57:49.633 --> 57:53.929
Dr Valentine will be able
to answer your questions.

57:55.764 --> 57:58.893
It's entirely natural,
upon losing a loved one,

57:59.018 --> 58:01.812
to ask, well, why.

58:02.479 --> 58:03.814
Not "why?"

58:04.607 --> 58:05.482
Why?

58:06.442 --> 58:08.527
Why, after you got your hands on her,

58:08.611 --> 58:11.113
did an old lass in perfectly good nick

58:11.280 --> 58:12.823
suddenly peg out, huh?

58:14.575 --> 58:15.409
Huh?

58:16.827 --> 58:19.121
Well, according to Sister Gilpin,

58:19.205 --> 58:20.915
she had gallstones, you know, and...

58:21.457 --> 58:23.918
and she was, of course, incontinent.

58:24.084 --> 58:25.628
-Oh, God.
-Oh. Well, yeah.

58:26.378 --> 58:28.339
I may not know much about medicine,

58:28.422 --> 58:31.759
but even I know that you
don't die of wet knickers.

58:33.510 --> 58:35.512
Your mother slept through
the ending of her life.

58:36.055 --> 58:37.473
In time, if not today,

58:37.556 --> 58:39.016
you will come to see it as a blessing.

58:39.099 --> 58:40.059
Ha!

58:41.352 --> 58:42.895
Sister Gilpin was at the helm,

58:42.978 --> 58:45.773
and, well, she is one of our finest.

58:46.649 --> 58:48.943
She's about to be awarded
the Bywater Medal.

58:49.026 --> 58:52.529
I don't care if she's about
to be awarded the V-bloody-C!

58:52.613 --> 58:53.697
Oh, sir, tmesis.

58:56.033 --> 58:56.909
Shut up!

58:58.035 --> 59:00.204
We shall be
pushing for an inquiry.

59:00.371 --> 59:03.332
With a... With a view to compensation.

59:03.457 --> 59:04.833
You have lost your mother.

59:05.501 --> 59:07.878
Surely no amount of money
can compensate for that?

59:08.963 --> 59:11.298
It can compensate us for inheritance tax.

59:12.258 --> 59:14.093
She made that house over to us

59:14.260 --> 59:17.638
six years, eight months and 25 days ago.

59:19.556 --> 59:21.225
In three months, it would have been ours.

59:27.731 --> 59:28.691
Boys!

59:29.942 --> 59:31.318
Do you want any? Come on, Dad.

59:33.946 --> 59:35.990
Am I disturbing you, Ambrose?

59:36.240 --> 59:37.491
No. I...

59:38.033 --> 59:41.412
Although I will have
to curtail a conversation

59:41.537 --> 59:42.997
if my visitor arrives.

59:45.082 --> 59:50.254
It's always such a pleasure
to chat with a former student.

59:50.337 --> 59:51.380
Well, I...

59:51.839 --> 59:53.966
I come to you as a student today.

59:54.341 --> 59:55.175
Ah!

59:55.509 --> 59:57.469
I am returning the book of  Modern Poetry.

59:57.886 --> 59:59.596
-Uh-huh.
-I enjoyed it very much.

01:00:00.055 --> 01:00:02.057
All the help you have given me
with my English

01:00:02.141 --> 01:00:03.767
is most appreciated.

01:00:04.476 --> 01:00:06.312
Ah, yeah, did you read them aloud,

01:00:07.271 --> 01:00:09.023
or just in your head?

01:00:09.231 --> 01:00:11.900
I always said to my pupils,

01:00:12.860 --> 01:00:16.947
"Verse does not live unless it is spoken."

01:00:18.365 --> 01:00:19.700
I did not read them out aloud.

01:00:23.912 --> 01:00:25.289
Page 44.

01:00:25.664 --> 01:00:28.250
Or, er, possibly 49.

01:00:32.296 --> 01:00:33.922
"Ten Types of Hospital Visitor"?

01:00:34.715 --> 01:00:36.717
Read the sixth.

01:00:37.384 --> 01:00:38.886
The sixth is ideal.

01:00:40.387 --> 01:00:42.181
"The sixth visitor says little,

01:00:43.057 --> 01:00:46.226
Breathes reassurance,
Smiles securely,

01:00:46.685 --> 01:00:48.729
Carries no black passport of grapes

01:00:48.812 --> 01:00:49.980
And visa of chocolate..."

01:00:51.398 --> 01:00:53.067
"...has a clutch
Of clean washing,

01:00:53.150 --> 01:00:55.736
Unobtrusively stows it
In the locker,

01:00:55.819 --> 01:00:56.987
Searches out more.

01:00:57.571 --> 01:00:59.281
Talks quietly to the Sister

01:00:59.365 --> 01:01:01.992
Out of sight, out of earshot,
of the patient,

01:01:02.618 --> 01:01:04.370
Arrives punctually as a tide,

01:01:04.661 --> 01:01:06.288
Does not stay for the whole hour.

01:01:07.206 --> 01:01:08.332
When she has gone

01:01:08.624 --> 01:01:10.417
The patient seems to sense her there:

01:01:11.126 --> 01:01:12.711
An upholding Presence"

01:01:17.007 --> 01:01:17.966
Oh, thank you.

01:01:18.258 --> 01:01:19.510
Thank you very much. Thank you.

01:01:24.556 --> 01:01:26.517
Now the last verse.

01:01:27.643 --> 01:01:28.685
It's very short.

01:01:29.978 --> 01:01:31.271
No, Ambrose. I...

01:01:32.648 --> 01:01:33.816
"The last visitor

01:01:35.734 --> 01:01:38.529
Is not generally named"

01:01:39.488 --> 01:01:40.697
It says tenth here.

01:01:43.492 --> 01:01:45.619
We...
We both know what it means.

01:01:53.627 --> 01:01:55.546
Are you going to move me on?

01:01:57.089 --> 01:02:00.217
Not unless we can find
you somewhere better. Okay?

01:02:27.035 --> 01:02:28.829
I don't wanna feed the ducks.

01:02:29.163 --> 01:02:31.373
Feeding the ducks is for kiddies.

01:02:32.082 --> 01:02:33.876
You'll hurt
the volunteers' feelings.

01:02:34.543 --> 01:02:36.420
They went out of their way
to find us something for them.

01:02:36.837 --> 01:02:38.589
Well, it's only
a bit of stale bread.

01:02:39.256 --> 01:02:40.174
All right, then.

01:02:40.591 --> 01:02:42.843
How about the sensory garden?

01:02:44.303 --> 01:02:45.637
It's for blind people.

01:02:48.474 --> 01:02:51.602
This is no way for grown men
to spend their time.

01:02:53.020 --> 01:02:54.563
You could always join that choir.

01:02:58.484 --> 01:03:00.360
Do you remember the strike, Colin?

01:03:02.237 --> 01:03:03.238
Just about.

01:03:04.239 --> 01:03:05.407
What made you think of that?

01:03:05.741 --> 01:03:06.700
Stale bread.

01:03:07.951 --> 01:03:11.288
You'd think it would be
the sound of truncheons on a riot shield,

01:03:11.371 --> 01:03:14.625
or voices raised in anger,
that reminded me.

01:03:14.708 --> 01:03:16.293
Not bloody stale bread.

01:03:18.128 --> 01:03:21.131
Your mam trying to feed us
with nothing in her purse.

01:03:21.298 --> 01:03:23.133
Yeah, the strike was a long time ago, Dad.

01:03:23.217 --> 01:03:24.885
Nobody's picketing any more.

01:03:26.303 --> 01:03:27.387
Nowt to picket.

01:03:30.057 --> 01:03:31.183
Do you know what I remember most?

01:03:32.768 --> 01:03:34.937
Just how bloody dreary it was.

01:03:36.104 --> 01:03:37.397
-Dreary?
-The talk.

01:03:37.981 --> 01:03:40.651
Endless, endless talk, all of the time.

01:03:41.818 --> 01:03:44.655
Though being egged on to hate
Mrs Thatcher was exciting,

01:03:44.738 --> 01:03:45.572
I'll give you that.

01:03:46.490 --> 01:03:48.534
Didn't last long with you, though, did it?

01:03:48.825 --> 01:03:49.826
Dad, I was a kid.

01:03:50.619 --> 01:03:53.455
If you push a kid too far one way,
they do end up going the other.

01:03:54.206 --> 01:03:55.457
I didn't push you.

01:03:56.708 --> 01:03:58.502
You had me rattling collection tins.

01:03:59.503 --> 01:04:01.797
You dragged me to the rallies,
put me on your shoulders.

01:04:02.005 --> 01:04:05.509
You made me sing
at Miners' Benefit concerts.

01:04:06.009 --> 01:04:07.886
There would be pound notes in the hat

01:04:07.970 --> 01:04:09.930
when you sang  Blow the Wind Southerly.

01:04:13.392 --> 01:04:14.393
Where are you taking me now?

01:04:14.476 --> 01:04:16.645
The sensory garden,
before the bloody ducks

01:04:16.728 --> 01:04:18.188
die of a Mother's Pride overdose.

01:04:23.277 --> 01:04:24.903
I've got to head back soon, Dad.

01:04:25.737 --> 01:04:27.489
What, to that bank hotel?

01:04:27.906 --> 01:04:28.740
To London.

01:04:29.199 --> 01:04:31.994
The Minister needs his hand-holding.

01:04:32.286 --> 01:04:33.745
He's not one as well, is he?

01:04:35.205 --> 01:04:37.207
No, he's not. It's...

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:39.918
It's a figure of speech, Dad.

01:04:54.600 --> 01:04:55.726
There's a threat of a strike.

01:04:57.728 --> 01:04:59.229
He's losing his nerve.

01:04:59.980 --> 01:05:01.607
Who's fighting for what?

01:05:01.690 --> 01:05:05.235
Doctors. For better
work conditions and pay.

01:05:07.070 --> 01:05:09.364
There is no more noble cause.

01:05:11.241 --> 01:05:12.951
I'm on the other side, Dad.

01:05:14.161 --> 01:05:15.287
I forget.

01:05:16.079 --> 01:05:17.331
I don't think you do.

01:05:18.206 --> 01:05:21.251
Your mam used to say
you had the voice of an angel.

01:05:24.087 --> 01:05:25.464
I don't forget that.

01:05:27.257 --> 01:05:30.010
Blow the wind southerly

01:05:30.135 --> 01:05:33.263
Southerly, southerly

01:05:33.972 --> 01:05:39.019
Blow, bonny breeze,
my lover to me

01:05:40.729 --> 01:05:42.898
-They told me last night

01:05:42.981 --> 01:05:45.817
There were ships in the offing

01:05:46.818 --> 01:05:51.823
And I hurried down
to the deep rolling sea

01:05:52.574 --> 01:05:55.744
But my eye could not see it

01:05:56.578 --> 01:05:59.247
Wherever might be it

01:06:01.083 --> 01:06:04.461
The barque that is bearing

01:06:04.628 --> 01:06:10.884
My lover to me

01:06:22.688 --> 01:06:23.647
Lad.

01:06:24.648 --> 01:06:25.482
What?

01:06:26.692 --> 01:06:29.820
Just because a thing has gone,

01:06:31.196 --> 01:06:32.864
doesn't mean it was never good.

01:06:34.116 --> 01:06:35.283
Well, what was never good?

01:06:36.451 --> 01:06:38.203
What went before and

01:06:39.204 --> 01:06:40.288
won't come back.

01:06:42.749 --> 01:06:43.667
The pit.

01:06:45.585 --> 01:06:46.878
Your mam.

01:06:50.090 --> 01:06:51.550
We've still got our memories, Dad.

01:06:51.717 --> 01:06:53.051
-Yeah.

01:06:53.719 --> 01:06:56.805
Right now, I'd settle for memory itself.

01:07:04.396 --> 01:07:05.439
And the lavatory!

01:07:06.523 --> 01:07:07.441
Giddy up!

01:07:11.778 --> 01:07:13.613
-Get off.
-Dad!

01:07:14.698 --> 01:07:16.199
Everybody kisses now.

01:07:16.783 --> 01:07:18.243
Not round here, they don't.

01:07:18.994 --> 01:07:20.245
It doesn't mean anything.

01:07:21.538 --> 01:07:22.539
So why do it?

01:07:26.918 --> 01:07:27.878
Bye, Dad.

01:07:29.588 --> 01:07:30.422
Son.

01:07:31.757 --> 01:07:32.591
Yes?.

01:07:33.633 --> 01:07:34.843
When you stopped

01:07:35.969 --> 01:07:37.429
wandering the streets,

01:07:38.972 --> 01:07:41.558
was it because you found
what you were looking for?

01:07:42.142 --> 01:07:45.061
I... I don't know what you mean.

01:07:45.437 --> 01:07:46.271
You do.

01:07:47.314 --> 01:07:48.148
Wig fella.

01:07:49.316 --> 01:07:50.275
The law man.

01:07:52.277 --> 01:07:53.153
George.

01:07:55.155 --> 01:07:56.656
So I forgot his name.

01:08:01.912 --> 01:08:02.829
I don't know.

01:08:17.761 --> 01:08:19.137
Still expecting your visitor?

01:08:20.013 --> 01:08:22.474
Oh, er, well, he's not been.

01:08:23.308 --> 01:08:24.309
That's good, though, isn't it?

01:08:25.936 --> 01:08:26.978
The important thing

01:08:27.145 --> 01:08:28.980
is always have something
to look forward to.

01:08:29.523 --> 01:08:32.484
Oh, I would look forward
to slipping away like Mr Jessop,

01:08:32.567 --> 01:08:34.528
or Mrs Maudsley,

01:08:34.611 --> 01:08:36.613
but I fear I'm not
going to be so fortunate.

01:08:37.155 --> 01:08:41.034
Life has one in its jaws,

01:08:41.159 --> 01:08:43.203
and it doesn't give one up
without a struggle.

01:08:43.453 --> 01:08:46.248
They... They talk about the jaws of death.

01:08:46.957 --> 01:08:48.792
It's not death that has jaws.

01:08:49.751 --> 01:08:50.752
It's life.

01:08:54.756 --> 01:08:57.717
Now, here comes pain with its gull's beak.

01:08:59.386 --> 01:09:01.555
I'll tell Dr Val
your dose needs adjusting.

01:09:09.271 --> 01:09:10.105
Are you choking?

01:09:11.481 --> 01:09:13.859
No, I'm bursting for a bloody bottle.

01:09:15.443 --> 01:09:17.612
There's one there, but I can't reach it.

01:09:17.821 --> 01:09:19.030
You've already gone in it.

01:09:19.239 --> 01:09:21.074
I know. I need to go again.

01:09:21.741 --> 01:09:23.243
Well, I might break the rules
and give it you,

01:09:23.326 --> 01:09:24.578
but you have to ask me nicely.

01:09:26.246 --> 01:09:27.581
Go on, say "please".

01:09:27.706 --> 01:09:29.749
You little sod!

01:09:29.833 --> 01:09:32.210
-I'm bloody bursting!
-Aw.

01:09:32.627 --> 01:09:34.254
I hope I never live to be your age.

01:09:34.588 --> 01:09:36.047
Help.

01:09:37.048 --> 01:09:37.883
Help.

01:09:38.341 --> 01:09:39.175
Nurse!

01:09:39.426 --> 01:09:40.343
What's all this?

01:09:40.635 --> 01:09:42.721
I don't care for raised voices on my ward.

01:09:42.804 --> 01:09:44.264
It means something's gone awry.

01:09:47.851 --> 01:09:49.227
-He's pissed himself.
-Go.

01:09:50.979 --> 01:09:52.355
It's always hard the first time.

01:09:52.981 --> 01:09:54.107
And you were doing so well.

01:09:55.483 --> 01:09:56.443
I sang out.

01:09:57.611 --> 01:09:59.446
I did. I sang out.

01:10:00.488 --> 01:10:02.115
But nobody would listen.

01:10:03.283 --> 01:10:05.368
It was
when an elderly lady came in,

01:10:05.535 --> 01:10:06.620
and she was afraid.

01:10:07.120 --> 01:10:08.371
So I said to her,

01:10:08.580 --> 01:10:10.457
  "Everything is going to be all right.

01:10:11.374 --> 01:10:12.459
  "You're in hospital,

01:10:13.585 --> 01:10:14.878
  "but you are in The Beth."

01:10:16.046 --> 01:10:18.673
  I gave birth to my son here.

01:10:20.050 --> 01:10:22.135
  I got put on the pill here.

01:10:25.597 --> 01:10:28.642
  They brought me a cup of tea
when somebody died.

01:10:32.187 --> 01:10:33.813
  I think it was my husband.

01:10:35.649 --> 01:10:38.109
  Our work
is other people's lives.

01:10:39.611 --> 01:10:41.696
I don't quite know
what happens to our own.

01:10:44.282 --> 01:10:45.116
What should I do with this?

01:10:45.200 --> 01:10:46.159
We eat on the run.

01:10:46.409 --> 01:10:47.827
Oh, there'll be a bin somewhere.

01:10:47.911 --> 01:10:49.120
-It's a beauty spot.

01:10:51.206 --> 01:10:52.832
We're always tired.

01:10:54.876 --> 01:10:56.670
Sometimes we are lonely.

01:10:58.254 --> 01:11:00.090
-Come on. I'll race you.

01:11:05.011 --> 01:11:07.097
And sometimes, somehow,

01:11:08.556 --> 01:11:09.474
we make friends.

01:11:10.725 --> 01:11:11.935
You never call me Alma.

01:11:13.770 --> 01:11:15.730
Hey, why did you choose nursing?

01:11:17.107 --> 01:11:17.983
Oh, I didn't.

01:11:18.400 --> 01:11:19.484
Oh, it chose you?

01:11:20.902 --> 01:11:22.445
It was my mother led me to it.

01:11:23.405 --> 01:11:25.865
She ran a sideline
in caring for the elderly

01:11:26.449 --> 01:11:28.576
in the days when the elderly
weren't farmed out.

01:11:30.203 --> 01:11:32.497
There'd come a time
when somebody's daughter,

01:11:32.580 --> 01:11:34.124
and it was always a daughter,

01:11:34.666 --> 01:11:37.002
would sit in my mother's kitchen weeping,

01:11:37.961 --> 01:11:41.589
saying, "And now I have
to do everything for them."

01:11:42.507 --> 01:11:45.051
Whereupon my mother,
being of a practical bent,

01:11:45.427 --> 01:11:46.511
would shoulder that burden

01:11:46.594 --> 01:11:49.014
and pocket whatever cash
was offered in exchange.

01:11:50.098 --> 01:11:51.641
Money was always persuasive

01:11:52.308 --> 01:11:53.935
because there was no Mr Gilpin.

01:11:56.104 --> 01:11:57.731
I became her assistant over time.

01:11:58.690 --> 01:11:59.983
Washing and wiping.

01:12:01.276 --> 01:12:02.235
Learning to say,

01:12:02.902 --> 01:12:04.904
"Don't fret, love. It comes to us all."

01:12:06.322 --> 01:12:07.824
And then it came to my mother.

01:12:09.993 --> 01:12:10.827
How?

01:12:11.786 --> 01:12:13.121
Long story.

01:12:13.788 --> 01:12:14.706
How?

01:12:18.752 --> 01:12:22.047
She were my first patient.
I kept her spotless.

01:12:22.964 --> 01:12:25.550
I pretty much did Mother
instead of A-levels.

01:12:26.301 --> 01:12:28.053
Maybe that is your speech, Sister.

01:12:28.678 --> 01:12:30.680
How life taught you what you had to give.

01:12:31.890 --> 01:12:34.017
Well, I'm not convinced
it did, as a matter of fact.

01:12:36.019 --> 01:12:38.229
Many's the day I've wondered
what it's all been for.

01:12:38.605 --> 01:12:40.523
You must know, in your soul.

01:12:40.940 --> 01:12:43.193
Or you could not have stayed
so long, and served so well.

01:12:44.944 --> 01:12:48.156
Maybe I just found something
other people couldn't do.

01:12:49.115 --> 01:12:49.991
Or wouldn't.

01:12:51.284 --> 01:12:52.285
I was good at it.

01:12:53.411 --> 01:12:55.330
I even excelled at certain aspects.

01:12:57.082 --> 01:12:58.416
It made me necessary.

01:12:58.917 --> 01:12:59.751
To the patients?

01:13:02.796 --> 01:13:03.671
To The Beth.

01:13:04.464 --> 01:13:06.174
You know, I love The Beth.

01:13:07.717 --> 01:13:09.886
Love complicates matters.

01:13:10.970 --> 01:13:12.013
I see it all the time.

01:13:13.306 --> 01:13:15.642
Middle-aged children
with tears in their eyes,

01:13:16.351 --> 01:13:17.227
pleading.

01:13:18.186 --> 01:13:20.480
"I love them. Oh, I love them. But..."

01:13:22.398 --> 01:13:23.858
And I have to bite my tongue.

01:13:25.193 --> 01:13:28.947
Because if they love them,
why do they put them away?

01:13:57.725 --> 01:13:58.643
Coat on.

01:13:59.644 --> 01:14:00.687
Are you not stopping?

01:14:01.813 --> 01:14:02.856
Just arrived.

01:14:05.525 --> 01:14:06.359
What...

01:14:06.484 --> 01:14:09.320
-What are you doing?
-Oh, just checking.

01:14:10.321 --> 01:14:11.739
It was a one-off.

01:14:14.659 --> 01:14:17.287
When it comes to incontinence,
there are no one-offs.

01:14:17.704 --> 01:14:19.372
Only inaugural incidents.

01:14:20.790 --> 01:14:24.085
You're on the list now.
And you know about lists.

01:14:30.091 --> 01:14:32.218
-We've had the Infirmary on the phone.
-Oh.

01:14:32.427 --> 01:14:33.887
Seven trolleys in the corridor.

01:14:33.970 --> 01:14:36.264
Oh! I bet they're all falls.

01:14:36.890 --> 01:14:38.224
There are a couple of hips.

01:14:38.600 --> 01:14:40.059
No hips.

01:14:40.685 --> 01:14:42.228
The minute we admit a fractured femur,

01:14:42.312 --> 01:14:44.105
we kiss goodbye to that bed
for eight weeks.

01:14:45.190 --> 01:14:47.233
-They were pleading.
-Right.

01:14:52.030 --> 01:14:52.864
Colin?

01:14:55.867 --> 01:14:57.577
My dearest

01:14:57.827 --> 01:15:02.624
We will leave Paris forever

01:15:03.625 --> 01:15:07.420
Life will be happy

01:15:07.629 --> 01:15:11.174
Me there beside you

01:15:11.466 --> 01:15:14.969
Sadness will vanish

01:15:15.386 --> 01:15:18.556
Now we're together

01:15:19.557 --> 01:15:22.769
Our lives will prosper

01:15:23.144 --> 01:15:25.104
All will be well

01:15:25.188 --> 01:15:26.856
Jesus Christ.

01:15:32.820 --> 01:15:33.738
You better be dying.

01:15:34.280 --> 01:15:35.406
If I was dying, I...

01:15:35.740 --> 01:15:37.200
I wouldn't be phoning you, would I?

01:15:38.243 --> 01:15:40.662
Dad...   (sighs)  I'm at the opera.

01:15:41.246 --> 01:15:42.914
When did you start liking opera?

01:15:43.915 --> 01:15:44.749
I don't.

01:15:45.917 --> 01:15:47.126
I'm with the Health Secretary.

01:15:47.543 --> 01:15:48.711
And before you ask,

01:15:49.128 --> 01:15:51.965
no, he doesn't like opera either.

01:15:53.967 --> 01:15:56.219
-Dad...
-Colin, I'm on the list.

01:15:56.511 --> 01:16:01.766
And lists make the difference
between life and the reverse.

01:16:01.933 --> 01:16:02.767
What?

01:16:03.309 --> 01:16:06.896
My bladder turned on me. And then she did.

01:16:08.481 --> 01:16:09.399
Who did?

01:16:10.024 --> 01:16:11.025
She might be listening.

01:16:13.695 --> 01:16:16.990
She said she'd put me on the list.

01:16:19.075 --> 01:16:21.953
But nobody's got my tally.

01:16:22.620 --> 01:16:24.497
All right, Dad,
you're... you're not...

01:16:25.957 --> 01:16:27.041
Look, I'll call you in the morning.

01:16:27.208 --> 01:16:29.627
-I can hear a bit of it.

01:16:30.420 --> 01:16:31.296
What, the opera?

01:16:33.089 --> 01:16:34.007
You've, er...

01:16:36.426 --> 01:16:38.511
You've gone far, Colin.

01:16:42.432 --> 01:16:43.725
I'll come and see you soon, yeah?

01:16:44.976 --> 01:16:45.893
Good night.

01:17:13.004 --> 01:17:14.505
Are you on the prowl again?

01:17:15.840 --> 01:17:18.051
I don't prowl, Joe. I patrol.

01:17:19.052 --> 01:17:20.470
You ought to be in bed
at this hour, really,

01:17:20.553 --> 01:17:21.637
not sitting up.

01:17:22.347 --> 01:17:25.266
I have to sit up when I'm in bed.

01:17:26.017 --> 01:17:28.978
I can't remember the last time
me chest let me lay down.

01:17:30.146 --> 01:17:31.272
I brought you some hot milk,

01:17:33.232 --> 01:17:34.233
if you fancy it.

01:17:36.027 --> 01:17:37.153
Oh, and a bit of good news.

01:17:37.236 --> 01:17:38.071
Oh, aye?

01:17:39.238 --> 01:17:40.698
Your infection's cleared up.

01:17:41.824 --> 01:17:42.742
You're getting better.

01:17:44.035 --> 01:17:45.244
How's that good news?

01:17:45.912 --> 01:17:47.622
You can go back to The Rowans
in the morning.

01:17:48.498 --> 01:17:50.083
The Rowans is a dustbin.

01:17:51.709 --> 01:17:53.169
Who gets my bed here then?

01:17:54.921 --> 01:17:55.963
A sick person.

01:17:56.714 --> 01:17:57.590
I'm sick.

01:17:59.133 --> 01:17:59.967
I'm old.

01:18:01.219 --> 01:18:03.346
But your infection's better, Joe.

01:18:03.763 --> 01:18:05.306
You're one of my success stories.

01:18:08.059 --> 01:18:09.644
I can't tell you
how good it feels, you know,

01:18:10.269 --> 01:18:11.896
to wave people off, thinking,

01:18:12.772 --> 01:18:14.065
"That's it. They've gone.

01:18:14.982 --> 01:18:16.776
And I have done my very best for them."

01:18:19.570 --> 01:18:20.613
Oh, come on, now.

01:18:37.296 --> 01:18:38.214
I liked it

01:18:39.507 --> 01:18:40.633
when we danced.

01:18:43.302 --> 01:18:44.178
So did I.

01:18:49.100 --> 01:18:51.936
Don't look so sad

01:18:54.897 --> 01:18:57.608
I know it's over

01:19:00.528 --> 01:19:02.405
But life goes on

01:19:03.156 --> 01:19:05.032
And this old world

01:19:06.075 --> 01:19:08.411
Will keep on turning

01:19:09.996 --> 01:19:11.831
I'll miss you getting your medal.

01:19:11.914 --> 01:19:14.208
-Don't say a word
- Mm.

01:19:14.292 --> 01:19:16.294
About tomorrow...

01:19:16.878 --> 01:19:18.963
Oh, it's all something and nothing.

01:19:19.839 --> 01:19:21.048
Just hoo-ha, really.

01:19:21.799 --> 01:19:24.177
That said, I will be getting
a blow dry in the morning.

01:19:26.345 --> 01:19:28.306
And I'll be back in The Rowans

01:19:30.016 --> 01:19:31.809
staring at four walls.

01:19:38.524 --> 01:19:39.775
You will be missed, Joe.

01:19:41.611 --> 01:19:43.404
I miss people all the time.

01:19:45.072 --> 01:19:46.240
You get over it.

01:19:47.116 --> 01:19:50.495
I'll get along

01:19:52.830 --> 01:19:55.750
You'll find another

01:19:56.751 --> 01:19:58.169
Oh, your milk's cold now.

01:20:00.713 --> 01:20:02.006
Would you take the lid off it?

01:20:02.089 --> 01:20:04.467
I... I don't drink out of beakers.

01:20:09.180 --> 01:20:10.056
Here you go.

01:20:13.809 --> 01:20:15.770
I don't know whether I want it or...

01:20:17.313 --> 01:20:18.147
or I don't.

01:20:21.234 --> 01:20:22.109
Well...

01:20:24.111 --> 01:20:25.238
It's there if you do.

01:20:25.947 --> 01:20:26.864
Hmm.

01:20:28.866 --> 01:20:29.742
Good night.

01:20:31.077 --> 01:20:31.953
God bless.

01:20:39.460 --> 01:20:42.046
Yeah, bit lower.
Just... Just there.

01:20:42.129 --> 01:20:43.673
Yeah, that's right. That's good.

01:20:43.798 --> 01:20:44.632
-That's it?
-Yeah.

01:20:46.133 --> 01:20:47.760
And the other side.

01:20:51.264 --> 01:20:52.723
And... And the same height.

01:20:52.932 --> 01:20:54.559
They... They have to be the same height.

01:20:55.142 --> 01:20:56.519
They're not the same height.

01:20:58.604 --> 01:20:59.730
Will you sign my form?

01:21:00.606 --> 01:21:01.857
You haven't done anything yet.

01:21:03.025 --> 01:21:05.695
And I understand you've extra duties
lined up this morning,

01:21:05.778 --> 01:21:06.737
at the do.

01:21:07.363 --> 01:21:08.281
Will you please sign it?

01:21:08.364 --> 01:21:10.491
I mean, Sister Gilpin
keeps ticking "poor".

01:21:10.700 --> 01:21:11.534
I'm better than poor.

01:21:11.617 --> 01:21:12.743
She should be ticking "average".

01:21:17.665 --> 01:21:20.751
You asked me
to cast my eye over The Beth.

01:21:22.086 --> 01:21:22.920
I did.

01:21:23.337 --> 01:21:25.923
And I saw things I didn't expect.

01:21:28.843 --> 01:21:29.677
It's loved.

01:21:32.263 --> 01:21:33.264
It's believed in.

01:21:35.057 --> 01:21:35.975
And it does its best.

01:21:37.560 --> 01:21:38.769
And I know none of those things

01:21:38.894 --> 01:21:39.854
fit into any of your policies,

01:21:39.937 --> 01:21:42.106
or even my strategic advice.

01:21:42.231 --> 01:21:44.191
Your strategic advice was to shut it down.

01:21:44.275 --> 01:21:45.985
Yeah, I know it was. But...

01:21:48.487 --> 01:21:49.614
It's not what people want.

01:21:50.197 --> 01:21:53.534
Three days up North
and he's preaching democracy.

01:21:55.411 --> 01:21:57.455
Yeah, I was up North
for a lot longer than three days.

01:21:57.580 --> 01:21:58.664
You offered it up

01:21:58.914 --> 01:22:00.750
as a guiding principle of management.

01:22:00.833 --> 01:22:03.002
Success doesn't like small.

01:22:03.336 --> 01:22:06.213
Small's expensive.
Small's a poor investment.

01:22:06.756 --> 01:22:07.590
Small lacks scope.

01:22:07.673 --> 01:22:10.843
Yeah, but nothing about the NHS is small.

01:22:11.427 --> 01:22:12.970
-Everything connects.

01:22:13.054 --> 01:22:15.181
Every single bed links through to someone,

01:22:15.389 --> 01:22:17.099
or something that's part of an entity

01:22:17.266 --> 01:22:19.727
so much bigger,
we can scarcely comprehend it.

01:22:19.810 --> 01:22:20.978
An entity which will soon be gone.

01:22:21.103 --> 01:22:22.355
Yeah, yeah... But that doesn't mean

01:22:22.438 --> 01:22:23.564
it was never any good!

01:22:24.857 --> 01:22:29.111
The NHS was the biggest idea
this country has ever had.

01:22:29.195 --> 01:22:31.447
And you will dismantle it at your peril,

01:22:31.656 --> 01:22:34.116
because people will not forget.

01:22:34.992 --> 01:22:37.078
-Where are you going?
-Oh, I'm going back to The Beth.

01:22:38.537 --> 01:22:40.081
But in a private capacity.

01:22:50.049 --> 01:22:50.883
Aw.

01:23:03.104 --> 01:23:04.271
-Oh, Mary.

01:23:04.355 --> 01:23:06.357
I was watching a video of my nieces.

01:23:06.440 --> 01:23:07.274
Do you want to see it?

01:23:07.608 --> 01:23:08.442
Presently, perhaps.

01:23:08.526 --> 01:23:10.486
But first, I want to show you this.

01:23:10.611 --> 01:23:12.488
Oh, no, you don't have to show me
what you've been filming.

01:23:12.571 --> 01:23:13.948
You just give it to the filmmakers.

01:23:14.365 --> 01:23:19.245
I fear they are not familiar
with the concept of marginalia.

01:23:19.870 --> 01:23:22.748
The importance of things
recorded at the edges.

01:23:26.836 --> 01:23:27.670
Morning.

01:23:28.212 --> 01:23:29.422
Look what I've brought.

01:23:52.695 --> 01:23:53.571
All gone.

01:23:54.655 --> 01:23:55.531
Lovely job.

01:23:58.826 --> 01:24:00.369
Would you take the lid off it?

01:24:00.453 --> 01:24:02.413
I... I don't drink out of beakers.

01:24:06.667 --> 01:24:07.668
Here you go.

01:24:15.050 --> 01:24:16.761
Have I acted appropriately?

01:24:16.844 --> 01:24:18.053
-Dr Valentine.

01:24:19.180 --> 01:24:21.724
We're having trouble waking Joe Colman.

01:24:22.683 --> 01:24:23.976
Yes, you have.

01:25:14.902 --> 01:25:16.403
What do you mean, he died in his sleep?

01:25:17.655 --> 01:25:18.864
Mr Colman,
when you get to us...

01:25:18.948 --> 01:25:20.533
No. All right. Listen to me.

01:25:22.159 --> 01:25:24.411
You leave my father
exactly where he is. Okay?

01:25:24.495 --> 01:25:26.038
I... I... I don't want him touched,

01:25:26.121 --> 01:25:27.957
and I don't want him moved.

01:25:28.040 --> 01:25:29.792
I was... I was already on my way!

01:25:30.501 --> 01:25:31.836
Mr Colman, when you get to us...

01:25:31.961 --> 01:25:33.796
When I get to you, I've got questions!

01:25:33.879 --> 01:25:35.548
And I... I want them answered!

01:25:40.469 --> 01:25:42.763
Ah! I finished
my speech at the salon

01:25:42.888 --> 01:25:43.931
as the rollers were coming out.

01:25:45.432 --> 01:25:47.560
I suddenly knew exactly what to say.

01:26:08.038 --> 01:26:09.331
Greeting the Mayor, hmm?

01:26:17.590 --> 01:26:18.632
All gone.

01:26:19.383 --> 01:26:20.342
Lovely job.

01:26:26.557 --> 01:26:28.017
It's a geriatric ward.

01:26:29.226 --> 01:26:30.811
Death is in the scheme of things.

01:26:32.354 --> 01:26:34.565
Beakers of milk and morphine

01:26:34.648 --> 01:26:35.983
aren't in the scheme of things.

01:26:36.567 --> 01:26:39.069
Joe Colman drank his of his own accord.

01:26:40.154 --> 01:26:42.573
Mrs Maudsley couldn't do
anything of her own accord.

01:26:43.032 --> 01:26:43.949
Well...

01:26:45.492 --> 01:26:47.745
I always helped them
if they were that far gone.

01:26:49.788 --> 01:26:50.664
Always?

01:27:11.894 --> 01:27:12.978
How many were there, Alma?

01:27:20.945 --> 01:27:21.987
How many, Alma?

01:27:25.950 --> 01:27:27.368
I had targets to meet.

01:27:30.079 --> 01:27:31.163
Beds to find.

01:27:33.415 --> 01:27:34.708
Folk to make grateful.

01:27:36.418 --> 01:27:38.379
If you could have seen even one of them,

01:27:38.879 --> 01:27:39.838
just one of them.

01:27:41.131 --> 01:27:42.549
The way they relaxed.

01:27:43.509 --> 01:27:45.386
The way their faces softened.

01:27:46.387 --> 01:27:48.305
All the pain and confusion gone.

01:27:50.432 --> 01:27:51.558
In a single moment,

01:27:52.434 --> 01:27:55.646
I'd accomplished something
no administrator ever could,

01:27:55.729 --> 01:27:56.981
and no doctor either.

01:27:58.440 --> 01:27:59.358
Not even you.

01:28:01.694 --> 01:28:04.405
The Beth had fulfilled
its obligation to the system,

01:28:06.115 --> 01:28:08.075
and I had ended someone's suffering.

01:28:10.577 --> 01:28:12.621
I used to think
you were so good with them.

01:28:13.831 --> 01:28:14.915
I was good.

01:28:16.291 --> 01:28:17.459
But you were lovely.

01:28:21.505 --> 01:28:24.299
Lights, camera, action.
The Mayor's taken her seat.

01:28:38.647 --> 01:28:42.109
The Bywater Medal was established in 1930.

01:28:42.985 --> 01:28:43.986
I like to think

01:28:44.403 --> 01:28:47.031
that the first nurses who won it, and I,

01:28:47.364 --> 01:28:48.615
have something in common.

01:28:49.575 --> 01:28:52.411
Just as we have with Florence Nightingale,

01:28:52.494 --> 01:28:54.038
who founded our profession.

01:28:54.955 --> 01:28:57.124
You'd take one look at all of us

01:28:57.708 --> 01:28:59.460
and think we were old-fashioned.

01:29:02.129 --> 01:29:04.298
We do the things
that have had to be done,

01:29:04.882 --> 01:29:06.508
since time immemorial.

01:29:07.926 --> 01:29:09.428
Since the world was young.

01:29:11.055 --> 01:29:12.639
I have done what they did.

01:29:13.932 --> 01:29:15.768
I have sought to be efficient.

01:29:17.227 --> 01:29:18.562
I tended the sick.

01:29:19.938 --> 01:29:21.732
I consoled the afflicted.

01:29:23.400 --> 01:29:26.070
I comforted the dying.

01:29:28.655 --> 01:29:30.074
I have cared.

01:29:41.335 --> 01:29:42.461
Oh, Lady Mayoress...

01:29:56.100 --> 01:29:59.061
Forget your troubles
Come on, get happy

01:29:59.436 --> 01:30:02.022
We're gonna chase
all your cares away

01:30:02.523 --> 01:30:05.484
Sing allelujah
Come on, get happy

01:30:05.776 --> 01:30:08.529
Get ready
for the Judgement Day

01:30:15.244 --> 01:30:18.497
It's all so peaceful

01:30:18.747 --> 01:30:20.999
On the other side

01:30:21.208 --> 01:30:23.877
Forget your troubles
Come on, get happy

01:30:24.461 --> 01:30:26.713
We're gonna chase
all your cares away

01:30:27.256 --> 01:30:30.259
Sing allelujah
Come on, get happy

01:30:30.342 --> 01:30:33.053
Get ready for the Judgement Day

01:30:33.137 --> 01:30:34.763
Get ready

01:30:34.888 --> 01:30:36.181
Get ready

01:30:36.265 --> 01:30:38.600
Get ready

01:30:38.684 --> 01:30:41.937
For the Judgement Day

01:30:42.062 --> 01:30:43.313
-Allelujah!

01:31:39.411 --> 01:31:40.537
- It's all right.

01:31:41.955 --> 01:31:42.831
It's all right.

01:31:57.804 --> 01:31:58.889
He was meant to be getting better.

01:31:59.848 --> 01:32:00.766
But he was terrified.

01:32:00.849 --> 01:32:03.018
I wanna know who was he terrified of,

01:32:03.101 --> 01:32:03.977
and why?

01:32:08.232 --> 01:32:10.192
We find ourselves
obliged to, er,

01:32:11.610 --> 01:32:12.569
apprise you of

01:32:14.363 --> 01:32:15.405
some developments.

01:32:26.166 --> 01:32:27.042
In the back, please.

01:32:28.460 --> 01:32:30.462
Mary's film
was shown in court.

01:32:31.838 --> 01:32:33.757
Sister Gilpin was jailed for life.

01:32:36.260 --> 01:32:37.386
The Beth closed down.

01:32:44.643 --> 01:32:46.228
Our patients were dispersed.

01:32:47.938 --> 01:32:49.982
And I went to work at another hospital.

01:32:56.530 --> 01:32:58.115
The Beth did not die.

01:32:59.324 --> 01:33:01.743
It was always just a bricks and mortar box

01:33:01.868 --> 01:33:03.078
for the things that mattered.

01:33:03.161 --> 01:33:04.538
I can take a look, thank you.

01:33:04.621 --> 01:33:05.580
And they matter still.

01:33:06.415 --> 01:33:09.668
They pulse on through the system
like blood.

01:33:11.420 --> 01:33:14.464
Care without question,
cost without counting.

01:33:14.965 --> 01:33:17.718
Belief in beds
without boundaries or limits,

01:33:17.843 --> 01:33:19.177
in spite of pandemics.

01:33:21.138 --> 01:33:23.056
I will always love the old.

01:33:24.141 --> 01:33:27.686
I will love them for as long
as they are here to be loved,

01:33:27.769 --> 01:33:30.314
to be nursed, to be encouraged.

01:33:31.982 --> 01:33:33.317
The virus, meanwhile,

01:33:34.359 --> 01:33:35.444
shows no mercy.

01:33:36.945 --> 01:33:38.405
-Ambrose?

01:33:38.488 --> 01:33:39.698
Do you remember me?

01:33:39.781 --> 01:33:40.699
No air.

01:33:42.326 --> 01:33:44.703
I know, my friend.
We are gonna help with that.

01:33:49.207 --> 01:33:53.086
Not generally named.

01:33:53.795 --> 01:33:55.213
Who is not generally named?

01:33:58.175 --> 01:34:00.135
Last visitor.

01:34:33.210 --> 01:34:35.504
We can
make unforgivable mistakes.

01:34:37.464 --> 01:34:38.965
Yes, we are stretched.

01:34:39.049 --> 01:34:40.467
Yes, we stumble.

01:34:40.550 --> 01:34:42.594
Yes, our reach exceeds our grasp.

01:34:43.470 --> 01:34:45.889
But please don't make the perfect
the enemy of the good.

01:34:48.308 --> 01:34:50.310
Don't dismiss us for what we cannot do.

01:34:51.520 --> 01:34:52.562
Don't tear us down

01:34:52.646 --> 01:34:55.982
and use our rubble
to rebuild your other empires.

01:34:56.066 --> 01:34:57.776
Profit will not profit you.

01:35:03.156 --> 01:35:05.826
We may buckle, but we do not waver.

01:35:06.576 --> 01:35:08.620
We are tested, but we do not flinch.

01:35:09.287 --> 01:35:10.956
We are here when night falls,

01:35:11.039 --> 01:35:13.417
here when darkness eases into dawn.

01:35:13.500 --> 01:35:15.168
We are here for your first cry,

01:35:15.252 --> 01:35:16.378
for your last breath,

01:35:16.461 --> 01:35:18.255
when you are broken, when you bleed,

01:35:18.338 --> 01:35:20.465
when others recoil or reject you.

01:35:20.549 --> 01:35:22.259
We will be here when you're old.

01:35:22.884 --> 01:35:24.010
And we would die for you.

01:35:28.682 --> 01:35:29.808
We are love itself.

01:35:30.642 --> 01:35:33.061
And for love, there is no charge.
