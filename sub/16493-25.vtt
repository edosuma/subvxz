you are destined

01:34.166 --> 01:39.166
to be the greatest middle school
safety inspector of all time.

01:39.249 --> 01:40.915
[alarm beeping]

01:46.790 --> 01:48.874
- [cell phone ringing]
- Elliot here. Over.

01:48.957 --> 01:50.665
Mr. Decker.
This is Principal Milder.

01:50.749 --> 01:52.291
Hello, ma'am. I was just
making the rounds

01:52.373 --> 01:54.874
downtown, taping foam rubber
on pointy objects.

01:54.957 --> 01:56.540
Is this about my resume? Over.

01:56.623 --> 01:57.957
Indeed, Mr. Decker.

01:58.041 --> 02:00.207
You've been selected as
our first candidate

02:00.291 --> 02:02.124
for middle school
safety inspector.

02:02.207 --> 02:04.457
We've been forced to
hire from within,

02:04.540 --> 02:06.957
and since you're our
volunteer crossing guard...

02:07.041 --> 02:10.207
Yes! Advancing through
bureaucracy! I'll take it!

02:10.291 --> 02:12.707
The giant mystic crash
test dummy was right!

02:16.582 --> 02:18.498
[bicycle bell rings]

02:18.582 --> 02:22.915
Okay, Elliot you've got this. Safety is my
life. Safety is my middle name.

02:22.999 --> 02:25.498
- I eat safety for breakfast...
- Good morning, Mr. Decker.

02:25.582 --> 02:29.041
Your assignment is to inspect and correct
any safety violations.

02:29.124 --> 02:31.041
At the end of the day,
if the school grounds

02:31.124 --> 02:35.332
conform to code and there are no major
problems, the job is yours.

03:03.124 --> 03:05.041
[Principal Milder] Mr. Decker?
Is everything okay out there?

03:05.124 --> 03:06.291
Help me! Hey!

03:08.124 --> 03:09.457
Did you just say something?

03:09.540 --> 03:12.582
Yes, uh, have a helpy day!

03:12.665 --> 03:15.540
"Helpy"?
It's "help" as an adjective.

03:21.166 --> 03:23.124
Principal Milder said
we could use the music room

03:23.207 --> 03:25.957
in exchange for never walking
past her office again.

03:26.041 --> 03:27.124
Well, can you blame her?

Sure. Whenever we sit
