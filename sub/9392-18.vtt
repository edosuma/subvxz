ANNOUNCER: Need to move?

00:36.804 --> 00:37.803
No problem.

00:37.805 --> 00:39.605
Take it yourself with U-Haul.

00:39.607 --> 00:41.173
But I've never driven
a truck before.

00:41.175 --> 00:42.374
ANNOUNCER: <i>No problem.</i>

00:42.376 --> 00:44.777
<i>U-Haul lets anyone drive</i>
<i>a giant truck,</i>

00:44.779 --> 00:48.180
<i>even though it's dangerous,</i>
<i>because, hey, you're moving.</i>

00:48.182 --> 00:51.150
(horns honking,
tires screeching)

00:51.152 --> 00:54.920
Sorry, I'm making a go
of it in a new city.

00:54.922 --> 00:56.989
All right, I'll see you
guys in a couple of days.

00:56.991 --> 00:58.190
Where are you going?

00:58.192 --> 01:00.092
I'm off to take pictures
of lesbian butts.

01:00.094 --> 01:01.326
What?

01:01.328 --> 01:03.495
Joe and Quagmire and I are
making a coffee table book

01:03.497 --> 01:05.664
called <i>Lesbian Butts</i>
<i>in '80s Jeans.</i>

01:05.666 --> 01:08.033
I already got the first
chapter right here.

01:08.035 --> 01:09.968
Where'd you take
all these pictures?

01:09.970 --> 01:12.204
You know, coffee houses,
Chevy dealerships,

01:12.206 --> 01:13.639
all the usual places.

01:13.641 --> 01:14.640
Peter, you're not
doing that.

01:14.642 --> 01:16.041
I got a ton
of errands to run,

01:16.043 --> 01:17.776
and I need your help
around here.

01:17.778 --> 01:19.344
Well, fine, if I
can't do the book

01:19.346 --> 01:21.046
I'm gonna hurt
something you love.

01:22.348 --> 01:26.118
(grunting)

01:26.120 --> 01:27.152
(coughing)

01:27.154 --> 01:28.754
You happy now?

01:28.756 --> 01:30.789
Maybe we should discuss this
in the other room.

01:30.791 --> 01:32.324
I don't like fighting
in front of the kids.

01:32.326 --> 01:34.093
No, I want to fight
in front of the kids.

01:34.095 --> 01:35.994
I feed off the excitement
of an audience.

01:35.996 --> 01:37.763
Peter, for once
you're going to stay here

01:37.765 --> 01:38.931
and help
around the house.

01:38.933 --> 01:41.200
Now, I need you to watch
Stewie till I get back.

01:42.936 --> 01:45.437
Whoever did this, thank you.

01:49.976 --> 01:51.110
All right, Stewie,
since Lois says

01:51.112 --> 01:52.144
I got to keep
an eye on you,

01:52.146 --> 01:54.480
we might as well have
some father-son time,

01:54.482 --> 01:55.747
so I'm gonna measure
your penis

01:55.749 --> 01:57.316
and then I'm gonna
measure my penis,

01:57.318 --> 01:59.084
and we're gonna see
whose is bigger.

01:59.086 --> 02:00.119
Doesn't really
seem fair.

02:00.121 --> 02:02.187
All right, let's see
what you got.

02:02.189 --> 02:04.623
Stupid game anyway.

02:04.625 --> 02:06.125
ANNOUNCER:
Hey, kids, coming up next,

02:06.127 --> 02:08.594
it's the <i>Jolly Farm Revue</i>
<i>marathon.</i>

02:08.596 --> 02:09.761
No, no, don't
switch it.

02:09.763 --> 02:10.762
I want to watch
<i>Jolly Farm.</i>

02:10.764 --> 02:14.766
I got to spend the rest of the
day watching stupid kid shows.

02:14.768 --> 02:16.535
I'd rather watch paint dry.

02:17.504 --> 02:19.571
(sexy music playing)

02:26.880 --> 02:28.947
Nice.

02:32.118 --> 02:33.919
Wakey, wakey.

02:33.921 --> 02:36.088
ALL:
Good morning, Mother Maggie.

02:36.090 --> 02:37.322
Heh, who's this?

02:37.324 --> 02:38.323
I like this lady.

02:38.325 --> 02:39.691
Hey, do you think
Mother Maggie

02:39.693 --> 02:40.926
is married to
Father Fa...?

02:40.928 --> 02:42.427
Oh, probably not.

02:42.429 --> 02:43.829
MOTHER MAGGIE:
And the unicorn slid

02:43.831 --> 02:46.665
down the rainbow
to a field of jellybeans

02:46.667 --> 02:49.001
where she
and the other villagers decided

02:49.003 --> 02:51.837
it had been the best day ever.

02:51.839 --> 02:53.772
Oh, look, it's Pengrove Pig,

02:53.774 --> 02:56.341
and he's sharing
his apples nicely, isn't he?

02:56.343 --> 02:58.443
Like a champ he is.

02:58.445 --> 03:02.915
♪ Head, shoulders, knees,
and toes, knees and toes. ♪

03:02.917 --> 03:06.485
And that's how you make a duck
out of an oatmeal container.

03:06.487 --> 03:09.488
This is the greatest show
in the history of television.

03:09.490 --> 03:12.457
Mother Maggie, you are
a kindred spirit.

03:12.459 --> 03:14.526
This must be how twins
who are separated at birth

03:14.528 --> 03:16.395
feel when they first meet.

03:20.700 --> 03:22.701
Trade house keys,
bang each other's wives?

03:22.703 --> 03:24.770
Yep.

03:29.142 --> 03:31.944
I can't dissect
this pig, Mr. Kingman.

03:31.946 --> 03:33.178
It's against
my religion.

03:33.180 --> 03:34.580
Believe me, Neil,
it's no thrill

03:34.582 --> 03:36.148
for the pig to
touch a Jew either.

03:36.150 --> 03:37.983
Okay, how about you,
Meg, how are you doing?

03:37.985 --> 03:39.618
Pretty good.

03:39.620 --> 03:42.454
It's, it's kind of cool
cutting something that's not me.

03:42.456 --> 03:44.523
Wow, that's some
very impressive work.

03:44.525 --> 03:47.526
It's easy for Meg to dissect
a pig because she is a pig.

03:47.528 --> 03:48.627
(laughs)

03:48.629 --> 03:50.028
Hey!

03:50.030 --> 03:51.630
All right,
I'll let that one slide.

03:51.632 --> 03:53.298
Meg, you have some
real potential.

03:53.300 --> 03:55.100
Have you ever thought
about becoming a doctor

03:55.102 --> 03:58.337
I always just assumed
I'd work on the docks.

03:58.339 --> 03:59.838
Don't limit
yourself, Meg.

03:59.840 --> 04:01.607
Doctors wear a mask
most of the time,

04:01.609 --> 04:03.342
so this isn't
an issue.

04:03.344 --> 04:05.043
If you're interested
the school has a program

04:05.045 --> 04:06.778
where you can shadow
a real doctor

04:06.780 --> 04:08.513
and learn more about
the medical field.

04:08.515 --> 04:10.682
Yeah, wow, I'd love
to check that out.

04:10.684 --> 04:11.917
Great, I'll
set it up.

04:11.919 --> 04:13.752
I didn't know a pig
could be a doctor.

04:13.754 --> 04:14.753
Hey!

04:14.755 --> 04:17.155
You get
just a few more of those.

04:19.993 --> 04:23.428
MOTHER MAGGIE:
Now, children, we're going
to learn who wears a hat.

04:23.430 --> 04:25.264
Can a fireman wear
a hat?

04:25.266 --> 04:27.099
KIDS: Yes.
No? Yes.

04:27.101 --> 04:29.001
Can a policeman
wear a hat?

04:29.003 --> 04:30.002
KIDS: Yes.
No way.

04:30.004 --> 04:30.936
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yes.

04:30.938 --> 04:32.271
Yes, he can, I knew that.

04:32.273 --> 04:35.807
Now, you at home, tell me,
who else wears a hat?

04:35.809 --> 04:37.476
A very formal horse?

04:37.478 --> 04:39.011
Very good.

04:39.013 --> 04:43.115
Even a bowling ball can wear a
hat if you use your imagination.

04:43.117 --> 04:45.917
(laughing):
A bowling ball wearing a hat?

04:45.919 --> 04:48.620
This is what high-def
was invented for.

04:48.622 --> 04:50.789
Peter, what the hell
are you doing?

04:50.791 --> 04:52.190
Being a good dad
like you asked.

04:52.192 --> 04:53.959
I've been watching
<i>Jolly Farm</i> with Stewie

04:53.961 --> 04:55.127
for the last
three hours.

04:55.129 --> 04:58.030
That's not Stewie,
that's a pineapple.

04:58.032 --> 05:00.032
Oh, my God, where is Stewie?

05:00.034 --> 05:01.333
I don't know, but
I'm sure he's fine.

05:01.335 --> 05:02.334
Peter, he's a baby.

05:02.336 --> 05:03.969
You can't leave him alone.

05:03.971 --> 05:05.871
Come on, it's good to
have some alone time.

05:05.873 --> 05:07.973
You know, I spent a year
alone on a desert island

05:07.975 --> 05:09.975
with nothing but a monkey
to keep me company.

05:09.977 --> 05:12.678
You're saved, sir, we're going
to get you back to civilization.

05:12.680 --> 05:14.479
And how about we bring along
your monkey pal?

05:14.481 --> 05:15.580
Okay.

05:15.582 --> 05:16.982
Yeah, we can teach
him sign language

05:16.984 --> 05:18.283
and he can
tell us stories

05:18.285 --> 05:20.285
about what you two did
on the island together.

05:20.287 --> 05:22.988
No, n-no, no, no, let's, let's
not, let's not bring the monkey.

05:22.990 --> 05:25.424
Um, I have a peanut M&M
up my nose

05:25.426 --> 05:28.093
and it's now further up
than my finger can reach.

05:28.095 --> 05:30.329
I am ready to farm
this out to someone.

05:30.331 --> 05:32.197
Oh, Stewie, there you are.

05:32.199 --> 05:35.033
Peter, I asked you to do one
simple thing-- watch the baby--

05:35.035 --> 05:36.768
and you couldn't even do that.

05:36.770 --> 05:38.170
Come on, Stewie.

05:38.172 --> 05:40.172
Geez, why's she got
to be such a nag?

05:40.174 --> 05:42.140
I wish she was more
like Mother Maggie.

05:42.142 --> 05:45.043
Mother Maggie has an
announcement, lads and lasses.

05:45.045 --> 05:47.746
I've had such fun playing
and learning with you

05:47.748 --> 05:50.315
these last few years, but now,

05:50.317 --> 05:54.753
just as bees must leave the
hive, I must leave Jolly Farm--

05:54.755 --> 05:57.155
not that you asked, but to have
fertility treatments--

05:57.157 --> 06:01.126
so this will be our last episode
of <i>Jolly Farm.</i>

06:01.128 --> 06:02.260
What? No.

06:02.262 --> 06:04.029
They can't cancel <i>Jolly Farm.</i>

06:04.031 --> 06:05.997
Peter, it's just a
stupid kids' show.

06:05.999 --> 06:07.766
Just a stupid
kids' show?

06:07.768 --> 06:10.335
What about Pengrove Pig
and the Lollipop Luau?

06:10.337 --> 06:11.837
I-I-I don't know.

06:11.839 --> 06:13.004
This is going
to leave a void,

06:13.006 --> 06:14.773
and somebody's got
to fill it.

06:14.775 --> 06:16.007
I think you're
overreacting.

06:16.009 --> 06:17.209
You don't understand,
Brian.

06:17.211 --> 06:19.311
What am I supposed to do
without <i>Jolly Farm?</i>

06:19.313 --> 06:22.114
I'll be like an Italian mom
without bad kids.

06:22.116 --> 06:26.017
Hey, hey, hey, what the hell
is all the commotion in here?

06:26.019 --> 06:26.918
We're not doing anything.

06:26.920 --> 06:28.453
You getting
fresh with me?

06:28.455 --> 06:30.589
I'm tired of bailing both
of youse out of prison.

06:30.591 --> 06:31.823
We're both
in college

06:31.825 --> 06:33.325
and we consistently make
the dean's list.

06:33.327 --> 06:34.793
I'm telling
your father.

06:34.795 --> 06:36.094
Good.

06:39.198 --> 06:41.299
Where the hell
is our food?

06:41.301 --> 06:42.868
Yeah, where are
Mom and Dad?

06:42.870 --> 06:44.636
And where's
that awesome finger painting

06:44.638 --> 06:45.637
Stewie did this morning?

06:45.639 --> 06:46.638
Oh, here it is.

06:46.640 --> 06:47.806
Thank you for bringing it up.

06:47.808 --> 06:49.107
I wasn't going to bring it up.

06:49.109 --> 06:50.809
Well, what's
going on?

06:50.811 --> 06:51.810
You haven't
eaten yet?

06:51.812 --> 06:52.778
No.

06:52.780 --> 06:53.979
Where's your father?

06:53.981 --> 06:55.847
He was supposed to put
the lasagna in the oven.

06:55.849 --> 06:58.617
I ask him to do one thing
while I'm at yoga.

06:58.619 --> 07:00.118
You go to an intro class

07:00.120 --> 07:02.087
and it's not even
at the yoga studio.

07:02.089 --> 07:03.088
It's in someone's living room.

07:03.090 --> 07:04.623
And that's not even a yoga mat.

07:04.625 --> 07:06.858
That's the old pee pad
from my crib.

07:06.860 --> 07:09.327
Uh, Lois, you might want
to check this out.

07:09.329 --> 07:12.130
What is it, Brian?
Take a look.

07:12.132 --> 07:17.102
PETER: And now, boys and girls,
it's time for <i>Petey's Funhouse.</i>

07:17.104 --> 07:20.105
(children cheering)

07:20.107 --> 07:23.108
♪ It's gonna be fun
and we'll have lots of yuks ♪

07:23.110 --> 07:25.477
♪ And maybe learn some stuff
but not definitely ♪

07:25.479 --> 07:29.014
♪ It's the <i>Petey's Funhouse</i>
<i>show. ♪</i>

07:29.016 --> 07:31.616
Ugh, another
Aaron Sorkin show

07:31.618 --> 07:33.885
that's way over
everyone's head.

07:39.025 --> 07:41.927
How the hell did you even get
a TV show, Peter?

07:41.929 --> 07:43.762
I just answered an
ad off Craigslist,

07:43.764 --> 07:46.798
and after several hours of
sexual torture, I had a show.

07:46.800 --> 07:47.799
(phone rings)

07:47.801 --> 07:48.800
Don't answer that.

07:48.802 --> 07:50.502
I gave out that
number under duress.

07:50.504 --> 07:52.971
Lois, Peter's show is on the
local public access channel.

07:52.973 --> 07:54.139
Anyone can have one.

07:54.141 --> 07:56.007
Yeah, <i>Petey's Funhouse</i>
<i>is actually replacing</i>

07:56.009 --> 07:58.109
<i>The Bad Audio Basement Show.</i>

07:58.111 --> 08:02.113
(distorted):
And once the hot glue dries,
your birdhouse will be complete.

08:02.115 --> 08:03.915
Peter, you already do
nothing around the house

08:03.917 --> 08:06.351
and now you're wasting
more time with this nonsense.

08:06.353 --> 08:08.687
Geez, you're still getting
on my hump about this?

08:08.689 --> 08:09.988
I help out
around here.

08:09.990 --> 08:11.623
Just this morning I
changed Meg's diaper

08:11.625 --> 08:12.924
and I sent her
off to school.

08:12.926 --> 08:15.927
Boy, can she kick, but
she left here spotless.

08:19.799 --> 08:22.000
Dr. Hartman, thanks for
letting me shadow you.

08:22.002 --> 08:24.035
I just know I'm going
to learn so much.

08:24.037 --> 08:26.605
It's my pleasure, Meg,
and you're in good hands.

08:26.607 --> 08:28.106
You see that diploma?

08:28.108 --> 08:29.374
Yale Medical School.

08:29.376 --> 08:31.209
Wow, that's
impressive.

08:31.211 --> 08:33.912
Thank you, I work very hard
on my calligraphy.

08:33.914 --> 08:36.314
So, how about we take a little
stroll around the hospital?

08:36.316 --> 08:38.450
This area is known
as a hallway.

08:38.452 --> 08:39.651
Don't worry,
you'll pick up

08:39.653 --> 08:42.287
on all the technical
doctor jargon pretty soon.

08:42.289 --> 08:45.257
Hey, is it prescription
or perscription?

08:45.259 --> 08:46.758
I think
it's prescription.

08:46.760 --> 08:49.928
Prescription... that just
feels weird in my mouth.

08:49.930 --> 08:52.497
Perscription is better.

08:52.499 --> 08:54.032
Oh, and there's the E.R.

08:54.034 --> 08:56.868
Don't go in there unless you
want everyone to yell at you.

09:03.042 --> 09:05.677
Hi, kids, I'm Petey Griffin.

09:05.679 --> 09:07.112
ALL: Hi, Petey!

09:07.114 --> 09:09.848
We're going to have so much fun
on   <i>Petey's Funhous</i>today,

09:09.850 --> 09:14.019
but before we begin, your friend
Petey wants to sing you a song.

09:14.987 --> 09:17.355
♪ What makes you
so special? ♪

09:17.357 --> 09:20.125
♪ The fact
that you are special ♪

09:20.127 --> 09:22.527
♪ But if everybody's
special ♪

09:22.529 --> 09:25.196
♪ That kinda
waters it down ♪

09:25.198 --> 09:27.999
♪ So some of you
ain't special ♪

09:28.001 --> 09:30.702
♪ I can tell you
who is special ♪

09:30.704 --> 09:33.038
♪ Like you and you
ain't special. ♪

09:33.040 --> 09:35.040
And you are
and you're not.

09:36.809 --> 09:40.645
Okay, kids, it's story time here
on <i>Petey's Funhouse.</i>

09:40.647 --> 09:44.249
Today's story is
<i>Lesbian Butts in '80s Jeans.</i>

09:44.251 --> 09:46.184
Ooh, that's a classic.

09:46.186 --> 09:49.854
Once upon a time, some chick in
a leather jacket in front of me

09:49.856 --> 09:52.157
in the parking lot walked
into Home Depot,

09:52.159 --> 09:54.993
and her butt looked like this.

09:54.995 --> 09:56.428
Everybody see this?

09:56.430 --> 09:58.763
Everybody see
how shapeless this is?

09:58.765 --> 10:02.167
She walked out of there with
a bag of soil on each shoulder.

10:02.169 --> 10:03.969
Now, before I show you
this next one,

10:03.971 --> 10:07.505
has anyone here ever heard
of the Sturgis Motorcycle Rally?

10:09.308 --> 10:12.110
I know we have a lot of yuks
here on <i>Petey's Funhouse,</i>

10:12.112 --> 10:14.746
but one thing
that's not fun is a bully.

10:14.748 --> 10:17.515
Now, how many of you kids out
there have ever gotten bullied?

10:18.417 --> 10:19.584
Aw, come on up here

10:19.586 --> 10:21.686
and tell us
about it, champ.

10:21.688 --> 10:26.658
Well, my name is Winston,
and I'm quite fond of ballet.

10:26.660 --> 10:28.960
One time I tried out
for Little League

10:28.962 --> 10:31.296
in my ballet shoes,
and the other kids made

10:31.298 --> 10:33.932
so much fun of me,
I wet my pants.

10:33.934 --> 10:35.433
What, wait,
what, like pee?

10:35.435 --> 10:37.135
How old were you?
Eight.

10:37.137 --> 10:40.438
Too old to be peeing yourself,
Baby Pee Pants.

10:40.440 --> 10:42.507
All right,
you kids finish him off.

10:47.013 --> 10:47.946
Hey, what do you
got there?

10:47.948 --> 10:49.814
Oh, I'm just playing
with some Lee Logs.

10:49.816 --> 10:51.116
What the hell
are Lee Logs?

10:51.118 --> 10:53.018
A little something I
created-- Lee Logs.

10:53.020 --> 10:54.152
Robert E. Lee.

10:54.154 --> 10:56.121
You know, you got Lincoln
Logs, you got Lee Logs.

10:56.123 --> 10:57.956
I don't get it, can,
can you build a house?

10:57.958 --> 10:59.524
You can build
quarters.

10:59.526 --> 11:00.959
And people live there?

11:00.961 --> 11:03.128
They live there if you
tell 'em to live there.

11:03.130 --> 11:04.929
I don't know if I like
the idea of Lee Logs.

11:04.931 --> 11:06.665
Yeah, they're not
selling very well.

11:06.667 --> 11:08.299
Peter, dinner!

11:08.301 --> 11:09.601
No dinner for
me tonight, Lois.

11:09.603 --> 11:11.936
I have to go work on
a bit for tomorrow's show.

11:11.938 --> 11:13.972
If I can kill 25
butterflies in a minute,

11:13.974 --> 11:16.007
I won't have to show
the audience my balls.

11:16.009 --> 11:18.109
Peter, this is the
fourth night in a row

11:18.111 --> 11:20.345
you've skipped out on us
to work on your show.

11:20.347 --> 11:22.614
Once again, I'm gonna be stuck
cleaning up the kitchen,

11:22.616 --> 11:25.016
helping out with homework,
and bathing Stewie.

11:25.018 --> 11:26.985
You know, I'd lay off
the nagging if I was you.

11:26.987 --> 11:28.319
I'm a children's TV star now.

11:28.321 --> 11:30.155
I can have any three-year-old
girl I want.

11:30.157 --> 11:31.756
Just know that, Lois.

11:31.758 --> 11:33.992
Peter, I'm only asking
you to do your share.

11:33.994 --> 11:35.026
Well, it's getting
on my nerves.

11:35.028 --> 11:36.127
Like, right now,

11:36.129 --> 11:37.429
you are the most
annoying thing

11:37.431 --> 11:39.998
in my life, with the
possible exception of Evite.

11:40.000 --> 11:41.966
What's this?
It's this Web site
you can use

11:41.968 --> 11:43.134
to invite people
to stuff.

11:43.136 --> 11:45.203
Does it have to be
a significant event?

11:45.205 --> 11:46.705
No. Not at all!

11:46.707 --> 11:48.139
Well, do you just
get the invitation,

11:48.141 --> 11:49.441
and that's the end of it?

11:49.443 --> 11:51.476
No, it'll remind you
about it constantly!

11:51.478 --> 11:53.978
Is there any way
I can customize this

11:53.980 --> 11:56.815
to showcase my personality
through familiar clip art?

11:56.817 --> 11:57.982
Yes!

11:57.984 --> 11:59.651
And what about
those replying?

11:59.653 --> 12:01.686
Can they demonstrate
their sense of humor

12:01.688 --> 12:03.021
through hilarious replies?

12:03.023 --> 12:05.457
Yes, yes, yes to
everything you're saying!

12:05.459 --> 12:07.959
I'm so excited
to get started!

12:07.961 --> 12:10.095
You do that while
I jump out this window!

12:10.097 --> 12:11.930
(glass shatters)

12:11.932 --> 12:15.100
ANNOUNCER: <i>Evite. Tell a friend</i>
<i>and then kill yourself.</i>

12:18.037 --> 12:19.871
And then when you
get a little older,

12:19.873 --> 12:21.372
stuff will come out.

12:21.374 --> 12:23.141
(old-timey car horn honks)

12:23.143 --> 12:24.576
Uh-oh!

12:24.578 --> 12:27.412
Sounds like my cranky
new neighbor just got home.

12:27.414 --> 12:29.080
I hope she doesn't
come over here

12:29.082 --> 12:30.615
and give me the business.

12:30.617 --> 12:31.783
(knocking)

12:31.785 --> 12:32.984
Peter!

12:32.986 --> 12:35.086
Oh, hi, Saggy Naggy.

12:35.088 --> 12:36.821
Never mind with "hi!"

12:36.823 --> 12:40.091
It sounds like someone's
having fun over here!

12:40.093 --> 12:42.127
You know I don't
like that!

12:42.129 --> 12:44.429
Hey, kids.
Meet Saggy Naggy.

12:44.431 --> 12:46.598
Real nice lady, huh?

12:46.600 --> 12:47.966
AUDIENCE: No!

12:47.968 --> 12:49.834
What can I do for you,
Saggy Naggy?

12:49.836 --> 12:51.336
You can stop having fun!

12:51.338 --> 12:54.172
But we like fun,
don't we, kids?

12:54.174 --> 12:55.440
AUDIENCE: Yes!

12:55.442 --> 12:56.775
Well, too bad,

12:56.777 --> 12:58.143
'cause you're all gonna
eat your vegetables,

12:58.145 --> 13:00.512
listen to long stories
about my cousins,

13:00.514 --> 13:02.847
and help me
fold sheets!

13:02.849 --> 13:05.016
And you! You're gonna
help around the house,

13:05.018 --> 13:06.184
take out the garbage,

13:06.186 --> 13:08.319
and give Stewie
his bottle!

13:08.321 --> 13:09.988
Yeah, I heard it.
They say my name

13:09.990 --> 13:12.290
on TV all the time;
calm down, bitch.

13:12.292 --> 13:14.159
Make me dinner,
and go rent <i>Twilight,</i>

13:14.161 --> 13:16.027
and do mouth
stuff on me,

13:16.029 --> 13:18.363
even though it's been
a day-and-a-half
since I've showered,

13:18.365 --> 13:21.099
and I've used several public
bathrooms in the interim!

13:21.101 --> 13:23.701
Sounds like this could
go on for a while, kids.

13:23.703 --> 13:24.936
Hey, Saggy Naggy,

13:24.938 --> 13:26.805
I know what'll cheer you up.

13:26.807 --> 13:28.039
Do you like pie?

13:28.041 --> 13:29.474
I guess.

13:29.476 --> 13:31.409
Well, how does this taste?

13:31.411 --> 13:34.445
(audience cheers)

13:34.447 --> 13:35.914
Well, I guess she thought

13:35.916 --> 13:38.082
it was a no-pies-in-the-face
kind of neighborhood.

13:38.084 --> 13:41.986
Wrong assessment
of the neighborhood, sweetheart!

13:45.591 --> 13:47.025
And how are you today, Mr....

13:47.027 --> 13:48.359
Pa-ti-ent?

13:48.361 --> 13:49.994
My last name is Saunders.

13:49.996 --> 13:51.930
That's an interesting
pronunciation.

13:51.932 --> 13:53.665
This is Meg; she's
shadowing me today.

13:53.667 --> 13:55.800
And boy, could she put
the applesauce away

13:55.802 --> 13:57.769
in the commissary.
Hi.

13:57.771 --> 13:59.671
Little tip, Meg:
The inside of this folder

13:59.673 --> 14:01.673
has a diagram
of the human body.

14:01.675 --> 14:03.007
Kind of a cheat sheet.

14:04.310 --> 14:06.978
Now see, right now,
I'm listening for cancer.

14:06.980 --> 14:09.080
Do you mean
his heartbeat?

14:09.082 --> 14:11.416
Maybe. Here,
you take a turn.

14:12.585 --> 14:14.853
Wow, your heartbeat
sounds a little fast.

14:14.855 --> 14:16.955
Do you smoke?
Actually, I do.

14:16.957 --> 14:18.990
Ah, me, too.
Isn't it great?

14:18.992 --> 14:20.291
Well, that's
bad for you.

14:20.293 --> 14:21.426
You shouldn't do it.

14:21.428 --> 14:22.760
It raises your heart rate

14:22.762 --> 14:24.495
and can lead
to emphysema or cancer.

14:24.497 --> 14:26.497
That's impressive, Meg.
It's no big deal.

14:26.499 --> 14:28.466
It's just stuff
I learned in health class.

14:28.468 --> 14:30.201
Well, you're clearly
a bright, young lady.

14:30.203 --> 14:32.136
And you've got quite a...

14:32.138 --> 14:34.138
head on your...

14:34.140 --> 14:35.106
shoulders.

14:35.108 --> 14:36.407
Thanks.

14:36.409 --> 14:38.943
Dr. Hartman, you just got
this urgent message.

14:38.945 --> 14:40.411
Oh, dear.
Prilosec, huh?

14:40.413 --> 14:41.746
No, it's below that.

14:41.748 --> 14:43.014
Oh.

14:43.016 --> 14:44.115
Oh, my God.

14:44.117 --> 14:45.083
Meg, I'm afraid
my brother

14:45.085 --> 14:46.684
just tried to kill
himself in prison.

14:46.686 --> 14:47.952
I-I have to go.

14:47.954 --> 14:50.021
You're gonna have to take
things from here, I guess.

14:50.023 --> 14:51.489
What?! What are you
talking about?

14:51.491 --> 14:53.791
Well, you now know
about as much as I do

14:53.793 --> 14:55.093
about this whole
doctor thing.

14:55.095 --> 14:56.361
But I have no formal
medical training.

14:56.363 --> 14:58.696
Ah, you'll be fine.
I think that book
on the shelf

14:58.698 --> 15:00.131
has most of the
stuff in there.

15:00.133 --> 15:03.101
And don't forget
the cheat sheet if
you need a helping...

15:03.103 --> 15:05.236
hand.

15:09.608 --> 15:10.909
Are we really
buying fish

15:10.911 --> 15:13.244
at the same place
we buy tires?

15:13.246 --> 15:15.513
And, w-what... "Fazio"?

15:15.515 --> 15:17.982
What, is that a brand
of Blu-ray player?

15:17.984 --> 15:20.418
Stewie, this sweatshirt
is so sophisticated.

15:20.420 --> 15:22.353
Look, it says New York.

15:22.355 --> 15:24.422
People will think
I'm from there.

15:24.424 --> 15:25.890
(children laughing)

15:27.126 --> 15:29.861
Put your phone away;
we're at a funeral!

15:29.863 --> 15:31.296
Oh, my God.

15:31.298 --> 15:32.931
(laughs)
Look!

15:32.933 --> 15:34.465
It's Saggy Naggy.

15:34.467 --> 15:35.600
GROUP:
Boo!

15:35.602 --> 15:36.701
You're mean.

15:36.703 --> 15:38.303
I don't like you,
Saggy Naggy.

15:38.305 --> 15:40.171
You stink, Saggy Naggy.

15:40.173 --> 15:41.906
My goodness, that's
a very rude thing

15:41.908 --> 15:43.174
to say to someone.

15:43.176 --> 15:44.842
Calling them Saggy...

15:44.844 --> 15:46.144
(all laugh)

15:46.146 --> 15:47.578
What the hell?!

15:47.580 --> 15:49.747
Young man, what do
you think you're...

16:02.995 --> 16:05.096
Lois, I just saw
Jessica Alba on
television.

16:05.098 --> 16:06.597
We've got 90 seconds;
let's go!

16:06.599 --> 16:07.932
Peter, I'm not
in the mood!

16:07.934 --> 16:09.200
That's okay. We can
do it anyway.

16:09.202 --> 16:11.703
Peter, I was assaulted
in public because of you!

16:11.705 --> 16:13.237
Oh, my God, what happened?!

16:13.239 --> 16:14.505
I'll tell you
what happened.

16:14.507 --> 16:16.674
A group of kids
attacked me at Costmart

16:16.676 --> 16:18.609
because you portrayed
me on your show

16:18.611 --> 16:20.311
as a raging
puppet bitch!

16:20.313 --> 16:21.612
Writers take
from their lives.

16:21.614 --> 16:23.982
You married a creative type.
You knew this was a risk.

16:23.984 --> 16:25.416
What's that
supposed to mean?

16:25.418 --> 16:28.086
Well, the last few weeks,
you've been nagging the
hell out of me.

16:28.088 --> 16:29.787
Peter, you think
I like nagging you?

16:29.789 --> 16:32.023
One of us needs to be
an adult in this marriage,

16:32.025 --> 16:33.524
and it's clearly not you.

16:33.526 --> 16:35.827
Is this about me wetting
the bed just now?

16:35.829 --> 16:37.095
Peter, don't
you understand

16:37.097 --> 16:38.930
that I'm just looking
out for this family?

16:38.932 --> 16:40.098
Besides, without
my nagging,

16:40.100 --> 16:42.100
you'd probably
get yourself killed.

16:42.102 --> 16:44.836
Or laid. Right,
frat house?

16:44.838 --> 16:46.971
Yeah!
(cheering and whooping)

16:46.973 --> 16:49.907
(laughs)
Those knuckleheads
should be studying.

16:49.909 --> 16:51.909
Okay, you know what?
Fine, Peter, that's it.

16:51.911 --> 16:53.911
From now on, I'm not
nagging you anymore.

16:53.913 --> 16:54.979
You're not?

16:54.981 --> 16:56.447
No, you're on your own.

16:56.449 --> 16:59.150
I'm done with it.
I'm done with all of it!

16:59.152 --> 17:01.786
Well, great, I should
probably get some sleep.

17:01.788 --> 17:04.022
Tomorrow on Petey's Funhouse,
we're doing who's on first.

17:04.024 --> 17:05.156
I'm gonna play
Costello,

17:05.158 --> 17:07.925
and Abbott is gonna
be played by live puma.

17:07.927 --> 17:10.361
Peter, that sounds
really d...

17:10.363 --> 17:12.330
you know what?
Sounds great.

17:12.332 --> 17:13.598
Have fun.

17:13.600 --> 17:16.334
Thanks, Lois.
Good night.

17:16.336 --> 17:19.504
Lois? Other families
fight, too, right?

17:19.506 --> 17:20.972
Not this much.

17:20.974 --> 17:22.840
Do you think maybe
we should think about

17:22.842 --> 17:24.242
getting a...
It is what it is.

17:24.244 --> 17:25.843
Let's just get Stewie to
college and go from there.

17:29.581 --> 17:31.182
Sir, if you're gonna
want me to examine

17:31.184 --> 17:32.750
where you're
having an issue,

17:32.752 --> 17:34.986
you're gonna have to be more
specific than "thingee".

17:34.988 --> 17:37.655
Okay. It's not
the front thingee.

17:37.657 --> 17:39.357
What's going on in here?

17:39.359 --> 17:40.858
Where's Dr. Hartman?

17:40.860 --> 17:43.261
He had a family emergency.
I'm not really a doctor

17:43.263 --> 17:45.129
but I've been sort of
filling in for him.

17:45.131 --> 17:46.297
You what?!

17:46.299 --> 17:48.866
Well, I think I want
to go into medicine,

17:48.868 --> 17:50.268
so I was shag
Dr. Hartm.

17:50.270 --> 17:51.969
I've actually
been learning a l,

17:51.971 --> 17:53.971
but then he just left me here!

17:53.973 --> 17:55.173
Well, you don't belong here!

17:55.175 --> 17:57.275
This is a professional
medical institution

17:57.277 --> 17:59.677
with standards
and regulations to adhere to!

17:59.679 --> 18:00.678
But, but I...

18:00.680 --> 18:02.480
I'm gonna have to
ask you to leave.

18:02.482 --> 18:04.982
I'm sorry.
I'll go.

18:06.952 --> 18:08.352
(bottle clinks)

18:09.688 --> 18:12.323
My issue has
resolved itself.

18:15.527 --> 18:17.028
PETER:
And don't go anywhere, kids,

18:17.030 --> 18:19.197
'cause coming up,
we got some classic comedy

18:19.199 --> 18:20.965
with me and a puma.

18:20.967 --> 18:22.767
Is Dad really gonna do this?

18:22.769 --> 18:24.936
I told your father I was
gonna leave him alone.

18:24.938 --> 18:27.004
Saggy Naggy is
keeping out of this.

18:27.006 --> 18:28.439
Is the puma ready?

18:28.441 --> 18:30.007
Maybe we should
poke him with the

18:30.009 --> 18:32.777
"is-the-Puma-ready?"
stick.

18:32.779 --> 18:35.513
(roars loudly)

18:35.515 --> 18:37.682
Oh, my god, I can't
let him do this!

18:37.684 --> 18:40.151
Come on, kids! We got to get
down to that TV studio!

18:40.153 --> 18:42.086
Okay, yeah, just step
on the coloring book.

18:42.088 --> 18:43.187
That's cool.

18:44.022 --> 18:45.523
(brakes screech)

18:48.293 --> 18:50.661
I'm asking you
who's on first?

18:50.663 --> 18:53.264
(screaming)

18:53.266 --> 18:54.332
(audience screams)

18:54.334 --> 18:56.033
Oh, my God! Peter!

18:56.035 --> 18:57.335
Cut the camera! Cut it!

18:57.337 --> 18:59.437
Roll a
"Petey Learn-A-Long Song"!

18:59.439 --> 19:00.438
(screams)

19:00.440 --> 19:01.973
(screams continue)

19:01.975 --> 19:03.274
(to tune
of "The Farmer in the Dell")

19:03.276 --> 19:05.109
PETER: ♪ Kentucky is a state

19:05.111 --> 19:07.111
♪ Kentucky is a state

19:07.113 --> 19:09.514
♪ All the people there
are dicks ♪

19:09.516 --> 19:12.350
♪ Kentucky is a state.

19:12.352 --> 19:14.285
Oh, he's hurt bad.
Someone call 911!

19:14.287 --> 19:15.520
He's bleeding too much!

19:15.522 --> 19:17.021
He needs attention now!

19:17.023 --> 19:19.323
Somebody help him!
Do something!

19:19.325 --> 19:21.125
Now she's nagging everyone.

19:21.127 --> 19:22.927
Does anyone have
any medical training?!

19:22.929 --> 19:24.962
It looks like his
jugular is severed.

19:24.964 --> 19:26.664
I learned this
at the hospital.

19:26.666 --> 19:29.033
Mr. Swanson, find me
a first-aid kit!

19:29.035 --> 19:30.968
Mom, hand me those towels.

19:30.970 --> 19:34.005
Did I hold on to the ball?

19:34.007 --> 19:35.106
Hang in there, Dad.

19:35.108 --> 19:36.574
I'm gonna get you fixed up.

19:45.150 --> 19:46.484
You can do it, Meg.

19:46.486 --> 19:49.020
Come on, Meg.
You've got to save him!

19:49.022 --> 19:52.423
(quietly):
Peter, you need to let go.

20:03.702 --> 20:06.003
L-Lois?

20:06.005 --> 20:07.271
Oh, Peter, thank God!

20:07.273 --> 20:08.573
You're okay.

20:08.575 --> 20:10.975
I guess you were right
about that puma.

20:10.977 --> 20:12.476
I don't know what
I was thinking.

20:12.478 --> 20:14.111
I should've
listened to you.

20:14.113 --> 20:16.113
Peter, I don't
care about that.

20:16.115 --> 20:18.849
I acted like a real jerk,
and I'm sorry, Lois.

20:18.851 --> 20:20.618
I know you just
get on my case

20:20.620 --> 20:22.153
'cause you're
looking out for me.

20:22.155 --> 20:23.287
I am, Peter.

20:23.289 --> 20:24.956
And it's only becae
I love you

20:24.958 --> 20:27.592
and I want the best for yu
and our family.

20:27.594 --> 20:29.393
I love you, too, Lois.

20:31.597 --> 20:33.297
Isn't anybody
gonna thank me?

20:33.299 --> 20:35.666
Yeah, I'll have a water
if you're getting one.

20:35.668 --> 20:38.002
Mr. Griffin,
you have a visitor.

20:38.004 --> 20:39.103
Hey.

20:39.105 --> 20:40.671
Hey. I get it now.

20:40.673 --> 20:42.473
"Who" is the man's <i>name.</i>

20:42.475 --> 20:44.609
Aha, ah!
