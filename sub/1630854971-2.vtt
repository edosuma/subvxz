00:01.479 --> 00:03.046
<i>Previously on
"Superman Lois"...</i>

00:03.046 --> 00:05.440
- Pregnant?
- There's still some blood work

00:05.440 --> 00:07.181
she has to do, but...
there's a pretty good chance.

00:07.181 --> 00:09.748
Whatever happens, we'll...
we'll figure it out.

00:09.748 --> 00:11.881
- I care about you, Sarah.
- I care about you, too,

00:11.881 --> 00:13.317
Jordan, but as a friend.

00:13.317 --> 00:14.753
Lana, you need
to put those funds

00:14.753 --> 00:16.407
back where you found them.

00:16.407 --> 00:18.627
You can't be messing around in
things you don't understand.

00:18.627 --> 00:19.845
<i>Henry Miller?</i>

00:19.845 --> 00:22.718
You have powers?
- Just like you!

00:26.548 --> 00:28.419
Henry... just tell me
who did this to you.

00:28.419 --> 00:30.247
I can help you.
- No one can help me.

00:32.902 --> 00:35.165
There aren't any bullets.

00:35.165 --> 00:36.297
<i>Hey, Dr. Irons.</i>

00:36.297 --> 00:37.689
<i>We can rule out pregnancy.</i>

00:37.689 --> 00:39.300
<i>I'd like to run
some more tests,</i>

00:39.300 --> 00:41.476
<i>figure out
what's causing all this.</i>

01:54.592 --> 01:57.204
What? But we don't even
have class today.

01:57.204 --> 01:58.553
Yeah, Principal Balcomb

01:58.553 --> 02:00.032
said school's out for,
like, a week.

02:00.032 --> 02:02.339
Yeah, for mold remediation,
not spring break.

02:02.339 --> 02:03.645
You still have to study.

02:03.645 --> 02:05.734
Your mom and I
are in agreement.

02:05.734 --> 02:07.649
Yeah, absolutely.

02:07.649 --> 02:10.347
Okay. Well,
do we have to study here?

02:10.347 --> 02:12.088
Bro, any excuse
to take the car.

02:12.088 --> 02:14.482
Oh, says the guy who jumps
at every chance he can to fly.

02:14.482 --> 02:15.787
Yeah, to save lives.

02:15.787 --> 02:17.137
All right, all right!

02:17.137 --> 02:18.964
You can go.
Please go.

02:18.964 --> 02:21.010
Hey, the moment it gets dark,

02:21.010 --> 02:23.752
that truck better be parked
back in the driveway.

02:23.752 --> 02:25.667
- Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:30.585 --> 02:31.803
You okay?

02:31.803 --> 02:33.196
- Yeah.
- How was your thing

02:33.196 --> 02:35.155
with your dad this morning?

02:35.155 --> 02:37.244
You know my dad.

02:38.810 --> 02:40.682
Look, I know
we haven't really

02:40.682 --> 02:42.771
had a chance to talk about what
happened with the pregnancy.

02:42.771 --> 02:44.686
- Clark--
- We both got excited.

02:44.686 --> 02:46.470
It didn't happen,
but if it's something

02:46.470 --> 02:48.907
that we really want,
then we can always try.

02:48.907 --> 02:52.259
It was fun to imagine
for a couple of days.

02:52.259 --> 02:53.521
But that's all it was--
a fantasy.

02:53.521 --> 02:55.131
Our lives are full enough already.

02:55.131 --> 02:56.654
You sure?

02:56.654 --> 02:58.874
I'm sure.

02:58.874 --> 03:00.919
Okay.

03:00.919 --> 03:03.357
Well, in that case,
did you know that Tal

03:03.357 --> 03:05.228
also has a villa in Bali?

03:05.228 --> 03:07.578
- Mmm.
- And home spa,

03:07.578 --> 03:10.451
three-tier Infinity Pool
overlooking the ocean.

03:10.451 --> 03:12.366
Rumor is he bought it
off Michael Bay.

03:12.366 --> 03:14.716
That is not a selling point.

03:14.716 --> 03:15.891
Okay.

03:15.891 --> 03:17.632
Actually, we should
go to "The Gazette."

03:17.632 --> 03:20.287
Chrissy said she had a lead
in the Henry Miller case.

03:20.287 --> 03:21.592
Okay.

03:29.383 --> 03:31.036
<i>Come on.
I know that's not true.</i>

03:31.036 --> 03:34.039
You must have had at least
one crush in your old world.

03:34.039 --> 03:35.563
Why does it even matter?

03:35.563 --> 03:37.260
Because we basically
have a free skip day,

03:37.260 --> 03:38.348
and I didn't think
we'd actually

03:38.348 --> 03:40.220
spend it doing homework.

03:40.220 --> 03:42.265
Plus, what if he
exists here, too?

03:42.265 --> 03:45.268
It could be like Romeo and
Juliet, but with other worlds,

03:45.268 --> 03:47.270
and nobody has to die.

03:47.270 --> 03:48.793
Ugh, okay, fine.

03:48.793 --> 03:52.014
There was this one guy
who was kind of cute.

03:52.014 --> 03:53.233
Travis Michaels.

03:55.365 --> 03:57.237
Oh, my God. He is cute.

03:57.237 --> 03:58.368
What, you actually
found him?

03:58.368 --> 04:00.022
And he's throwing a party.

04:00.022 --> 04:01.545
Nat, his house is insane!

04:01.545 --> 04:04.548
We have to go to this party.
It's, like, meant to be.

04:04.548 --> 04:07.072
We can't just
go to Metropolis.

04:07.072 --> 04:08.248
Why not?
I have a car.

04:08.248 --> 04:10.162
Your mom will
be okay with that?

04:10.162 --> 04:11.425
She's busy with
marriage stuff.

04:11.425 --> 04:13.862
She won't even notice I'm gone.

04:13.862 --> 04:15.255
Come on.

04:15.255 --> 04:17.213
I am making a sacred vow
of friendship

04:17.213 --> 04:19.520
to be your wing woman.

04:19.520 --> 04:21.435
Come on. You can finish
your homework tomorrow.

04:21.435 --> 04:23.175
Oh, no, no, I'm doing
a project for the DOD.

04:23.175 --> 04:24.829
Okay. close your laptop.

04:24.829 --> 04:27.571
We're definitely
going to that party.

04:27.571 --> 04:29.617
Okay. I'll pick you up in 30?

04:30.792 --> 04:32.489
Hey, guys.

04:32.489 --> 04:34.404
Hey.
We were just leaving,

04:34.404 --> 04:36.058
so you guys can take our seat.

04:36.058 --> 04:39.322
Oh, um, what are you
guys doing later?

04:39.322 --> 04:41.106
Not-not, like,
asking you to hang out,

04:41.106 --> 04:43.805
but if you want to,
we can, but, uh...

04:43.805 --> 04:46.024
- Well, actually, we're--
- It's kind of a girl thing.

04:46.024 --> 04:47.287
Sorry!

04:49.158 --> 04:51.029
Bye, guys!

04:54.685 --> 04:56.644
<i>Riddle me this.</i>

04:56.644 --> 04:59.299
Why would a judge
deny Henry Miller's

04:59.299 --> 05:01.126
petition for release
three times,

05:01.126 --> 05:02.476
only to change her mind?

05:02.476 --> 05:04.042
Who's the judge?

05:04.042 --> 05:06.654
Tara Reagan,
former public defender,

05:06.654 --> 05:09.221
youngest judge ever appointed
to her district court.

05:09.221 --> 05:10.658
Any shady dealings
in her past?

05:10.658 --> 05:12.747
Well, you can ask her yourself.

05:12.747 --> 05:16.141
She agreed to an interview with
you about judiciary reform.

05:16.141 --> 05:17.882
Ah, so we're ambushing her.

05:17.882 --> 05:20.624
Well, technically,
Lois is ambushing her,

05:20.624 --> 05:22.060
which I didn't think
that she would mind,

05:22.060 --> 05:23.627
because, well, she's Lois.

05:23.627 --> 05:25.673
Great.
I'm going to head out now

05:25.673 --> 05:27.283
before she leaves for the day.
Nice work.

05:27.283 --> 05:30.242
Oh, you mean literally
right at this exact moment?

05:30.242 --> 05:33.333
Before giving me notes
on our editor's column?

05:33.333 --> 05:36.118
Yeah, I'm sure it's great.
Run it.

05:38.686 --> 05:42.124
Uh, hey,
maybe I could go with you?

05:42.124 --> 05:44.126
I can handle a judge, Clark.

05:44.126 --> 05:45.519
I completely agree with you.

05:45.519 --> 05:47.042
But don't you think
this calls for

05:47.042 --> 05:50.045
a classic Lois Lane,
Clark Kent team up?

05:50.045 --> 05:51.699
Like the time we took down
those guys

05:51.699 --> 05:53.353
at the Green Horse Inn
for money laundering?

05:53.353 --> 05:54.484
Oh, you mean
the time you forgot

05:54.484 --> 05:55.746
to turn the tape
recorder on?

05:55.746 --> 05:58.053
One time.
One time, that happened.

05:58.053 --> 06:01.839
Come on. I can shave hours
off your commute.

06:01.839 --> 06:03.885
Fine.
But let's get moving.

06:07.236 --> 06:09.673
Where are the paperweights?

06:11.283 --> 06:12.459
<i>Metropolis?</i>

06:12.459 --> 06:13.938
Just for today.

06:13.938 --> 06:14.939
But it's our night.

06:14.939 --> 06:16.550
I'm making your
favorite tortellini.

06:16.550 --> 06:17.638
Maybe I can have
some when I get back?

06:17.638 --> 06:19.466
It's just, there's this party.

06:19.466 --> 06:22.077
Ah. Ha.
Yeah, shoulda guessed

06:22.077 --> 06:24.122
you weren't dressed up
for pasta night.

06:24.122 --> 06:26.081
I'm not that dressed up.

06:26.081 --> 06:29.040
All right.
Tell me about the party.

06:29.040 --> 06:30.215
Will there be boys there?

06:30.215 --> 06:32.043
- Uh, yes.
- Alcohol?

06:32.043 --> 06:34.350
Maybe.
But I won't be drinking any.

06:34.350 --> 06:35.612
- Who's driving?
- Sarah.

06:35.612 --> 06:37.005
And she won't be
drinking any either.

06:37.005 --> 06:38.572
And how would you
rate her willpower

06:38.572 --> 06:40.008
on a scale of one to ten?

06:40.008 --> 06:41.966
Look, Dad,
you said you wanted me

06:41.966 --> 06:44.186
to hang out with
high school kids, okay?

06:44.186 --> 06:45.579
This is what they do.

06:45.579 --> 06:47.102
They go to high school parties.

06:49.974 --> 06:50.845
All right.

06:50.845 --> 06:53.456
Just, uh, be home by midnight.

06:53.456 --> 06:55.240
Okay?
- Okay.

06:55.240 --> 06:57.547
Save me some leftovers.

07:04.598 --> 07:06.208
Mom, I'm heading out.

07:06.208 --> 07:07.557
Where are you going?

07:07.557 --> 07:09.603
Uh, over to Nat's.

07:09.603 --> 07:11.561
We're going to have
a movie marathon.

07:11.561 --> 07:13.607
Oh, that's fun.
What movies?

07:13.607 --> 07:15.957
Um, you know,
just the classics.

07:15.957 --> 07:17.001
Mmm.

07:18.307 --> 07:20.614
Oh, God, why is
George Dean calling me?

07:20.614 --> 07:22.572
Oh, you should
probably get that.

07:22.572 --> 07:24.444
I'll see you later?

07:27.272 --> 07:29.318
- Hello, George.
<i>- Lana--oh, thank God.</i>

07:29.318 --> 07:30.885
<i>I need you to listen to me.</i>

07:30.885 --> 07:33.627
<i>Please, please listen.</i>
- George, slow down.

07:33.627 --> 07:34.889
What's going on?

07:34.889 --> 07:36.717
I made a big mistake!

07:38.588 --> 07:40.329
George, what is that noise?

07:40.329 --> 07:42.462
Aah!

07:45.334 --> 07:46.944
<i>George?</i>

07:48.163 --> 07:49.860
Stop right there!

07:49.860 --> 07:52.428
George, can you hear me?

07:52.428 --> 07:55.213
<i>Lana,
you have to understand!</i>

07:55.213 --> 07:58.478
<i>It was always about
the pride of Smallville!</i>

07:58.478 --> 08:00.784
George?
What's happening?

08:05.659 --> 08:06.964
George?

08:06.964 --> 08:09.880
George, are you okay?
Can you hear me?

08:09.880 --> 08:11.099
<i>George!</i>

08:12.709 --> 08:13.928
<i>Hello?</i>

08:13.928 --> 08:16.191
<i>George, are you okay?</i>

08:17.192 --> 08:19.368
<i>Oh, God, answer.</i>

08:19.368 --> 08:23.372
<i>George, where are you?
Are you okay?</i>

08:23.372 --> 08:26.114
<i>George, answer me!</i>

08:26.114 --> 08:28.769
<i>George! Please--</i>

08:38.605 --> 08:40.171
How much longer
is the judge

08:40.171 --> 08:41.477
gonna make us wait?
- It's kinda fun being back

08:41.477 --> 08:43.044
in our old stomping grounds.

08:43.044 --> 08:45.742
Oh, do you think Harry still
has that early bird special?

08:45.742 --> 08:49.398
I don't know.

08:49.398 --> 08:51.400
Are you sure nothing happened
with your dad this morning?

08:51.400 --> 08:53.881
He didn't say something
that upset you, or--

08:53.881 --> 08:55.883
You want to know
what's upsetting me?

08:55.883 --> 08:59.234
The fact that some lunatic
we put behind bars years ago

08:59.234 --> 09:03.194
was back on the streets
with superpowers.

09:03.194 --> 09:04.631
Where is this judge?

09:04.631 --> 09:05.936
Apologies, Ms. Lane.

09:05.936 --> 09:08.852
You arrived earlier
than expected.

09:08.852 --> 09:10.811
My assistant tells me
that you're doing

09:10.811 --> 09:12.856
a story on judicial reform.

09:12.856 --> 09:14.510
Actually, we want to
ask you a few questions

09:14.510 --> 09:16.164
about Henry Miller.

09:18.383 --> 09:21.386
Dude, you're not
going to believe this.

09:21.386 --> 09:24.564
Eliza just texted me
about some crazy party

09:24.564 --> 09:26.174
going down in Metropolis.

09:26.174 --> 09:27.741
There's going to be
like 500 kids, too.

09:27.741 --> 09:29.090
We should go.

09:29.090 --> 09:30.395
We're not driving
to Metropolis right now.

09:30.395 --> 09:31.962
We will not make
it back by dark.

09:31.962 --> 09:32.920
You heard Mom.

09:32.920 --> 09:35.270
I know. But we can fly.

09:36.619 --> 09:38.926
You mean, like, I carry you?

09:38.926 --> 09:41.842
Jordan, what else
are you going to do today?

09:41.842 --> 09:44.975
Mope around in your room
and play Stumble Guys?

09:44.975 --> 09:47.282
Seriously...
you need to, like,

09:47.282 --> 09:50.241
forget about Sarah
and, like, move forward.

09:50.241 --> 09:52.635
Why is Eliza even
texting you about a party?

09:52.635 --> 09:53.897
Didn't she dump you?

09:53.897 --> 09:56.726
Yes. And it sucked.

09:56.726 --> 09:58.249
But I moved on, okay?

09:58.249 --> 09:59.860
And she texted me last
week, happy birthday,

09:59.860 --> 10:01.122
and we're cool again.

10:01.122 --> 10:02.993
It's not that easy
for everyone else

10:02.993 --> 10:04.778
to be friends with their ex.
- Well, you know what would

10:04.778 --> 10:06.388
actually make that easier?

10:06.388 --> 10:08.564
Is if you actually try to
get over Sarah

10:08.564 --> 10:11.045
by actually
talking to another girl.

10:11.045 --> 10:12.829
And you know where
there's going

10:12.829 --> 10:14.788
to be tons of other girls?

10:14.788 --> 10:17.312
- Metropolis party.
- Metropolis party.

10:17.312 --> 10:18.922
That's right.

10:20.663 --> 10:22.709
Eternals, right?

10:25.668 --> 10:28.192
Any idea what happened?

10:28.192 --> 10:30.760
You know, when we
got here, it was just, um...

10:30.760 --> 10:33.371
just Dean's body...

10:33.371 --> 10:35.243
dead on the hood of his car.

10:35.243 --> 10:40.117
You know, he had, um, shotgun
wounds to the stomach area.

10:40.117 --> 10:43.904
But, uh, we haven't been
able to find any pellets.

10:43.904 --> 10:48.169
I dunno, it's... seems like
they disappeared or something.

10:50.432 --> 10:53.740
I did not think that I'd be
reporting on a murder today.

10:57.918 --> 11:00.311
You know, I remember when Dean
first got elected.

11:00.311 --> 11:02.705
Yeah, he came into
my third-grade class

11:02.705 --> 11:05.273
to teach us about civic duty.

11:05.273 --> 11:08.058
I literally thought
his first name was Mayor.

11:08.058 --> 11:11.758
You were, uh, you were in
the third grade then, huh?

11:13.847 --> 11:16.284
I...guess we just skipped
right past the, uh,

11:16.284 --> 11:19.679
whole getting to know each
other formalities, huh?

11:19.679 --> 11:21.985
Hi, Mrs. Mayor.

11:21.985 --> 11:23.508
Hey.

11:23.508 --> 11:24.858
Thank you for your time,

11:24.858 --> 11:26.729
Chief Cushing.
- Yeah, sure.

11:27.817 --> 11:29.427
How are you holding up?

11:29.427 --> 11:31.516
It's been a lot.

11:31.516 --> 11:32.866
But I'm fine.

11:32.866 --> 11:34.955
If you need to talk,
I-I'm here.

11:34.955 --> 11:36.608
I appreciate it, Kyle.

11:36.608 --> 11:39.089
Right now, I just
need to get Sarah.

11:39.089 --> 11:43.354
This is going to be
such a big shock for her.

11:43.354 --> 11:47.489
Her and George Jr.
used to be so close.

11:54.235 --> 11:56.585
<i>Nat, this party's insane!</i>

11:56.585 --> 11:59.196
Yeah, I'm not sure
about the vibe, though.

11:59.196 --> 12:02.373
Come on, let's find Travis!

12:04.724 --> 12:07.074
- 12 o'clock!
- Where?

12:08.815 --> 12:11.295
No, Sarah!

12:11.295 --> 12:13.123
Who cares about
the finish?

12:13.123 --> 12:15.038
It's just that the
windows aren't tinted.

12:15.038 --> 12:17.998
The rims are standard--
- But it's a new car.

12:17.998 --> 12:20.087
I got a watch for
my 16th birthday.

12:20.087 --> 12:22.437
Yeah, okay, that's gonna
be a hard pass.

12:22.437 --> 12:24.526
I mean,
it doesn't sound great,

12:24.526 --> 12:26.702
but maybe it was just
something out of context?

12:26.702 --> 12:28.573
Oh.
Context of that one's

12:28.573 --> 12:29.879
pretty clear.
- Yeah.

12:29.879 --> 12:33.665
Uh, well, maybe
there's other cute guys.

12:33.665 --> 12:36.843
Yo, I think
I swallowed a bug.

12:36.843 --> 12:38.627
I told you to
close your mouth.

12:38.627 --> 12:40.847
John? You made it!

12:40.847 --> 12:42.805
Hey, Eliza.

12:43.806 --> 12:45.286
Hey.

12:47.984 --> 12:50.770
And you brought your brother.

12:50.770 --> 12:54.774
You wouldn't mind if we talk
alone for a minute, do you?

12:54.774 --> 12:57.994
Sure.
Uh, listen.

12:57.994 --> 13:01.041
I will be right in.

13:01.041 --> 13:03.347
You just go talk to a girl.

13:03.347 --> 13:05.741
Okay? Any girl.

13:05.741 --> 13:08.309
You got this.

13:10.659 --> 13:12.400
Sorry about Travis.

13:12.400 --> 13:13.488
Maybe it's for the best.

13:13.488 --> 13:15.316
He did look like
a terrible kisser.

13:15.316 --> 13:16.970
Look, I just feel
kind of stupid.

13:16.970 --> 13:18.493
We should go home.
- No!

13:18.493 --> 13:20.625
As your wing woman,
that's like not an option.

13:20.625 --> 13:22.627
Today's about fun!

13:22.627 --> 13:24.499
Oh, my God, don't look now,

13:24.499 --> 13:27.850
but that guy's
totally staring at you.

13:27.850 --> 13:29.721
He's kinda cute, right?

13:29.721 --> 13:31.854
I mean, yeah, I guess,

13:31.854 --> 13:34.204
knowing absolutely
nothing about him.

13:34.204 --> 13:35.684
On it.

13:35.684 --> 13:37.555
- No, Sarah--
- Get off!

13:41.908 --> 13:43.300
See my friend?

13:45.737 --> 13:48.523
- Are you sure?
- Yeah. Come on.

13:54.268 --> 13:56.357
Uh, Matteo,
this is Natalie.

13:56.357 --> 13:58.011
Nat, this is Matteo.

14:00.622 --> 14:03.973
Feel free to say hi
to each other.

14:03.973 --> 14:05.975
So, uh, ha...
your friend tells me

14:05.975 --> 14:07.847
that she's your wing woman.

14:07.847 --> 14:09.109
Oh, my God.

14:09.109 --> 14:10.458
No, it's cool, it's cool.

14:10.458 --> 14:12.286
I was actually
working up the nerve

14:12.286 --> 14:13.591
to come over and talk to you.

14:13.591 --> 14:16.856
She just sort of forced
my hand a little.

14:16.856 --> 14:18.509
Really?

14:18.509 --> 14:20.860
Wing woman out.

14:22.470 --> 14:28.476
So, uh, she's definitely,
like... not afraid.

14:28.476 --> 14:33.046
No, she's... she's
kind of the best.

14:39.791 --> 14:42.925
Hi, um, I'm Jordan.

14:50.454 --> 14:52.369
Yes!

14:54.806 --> 14:57.026
Oh!

14:57.026 --> 14:59.724
Oh-oh, my God!
I am so sorry!

14:59.724 --> 15:02.640
This better come out,
or I'm gonna beat your ass.

15:02.640 --> 15:05.121
I-I'm really sorry.

15:07.080 --> 15:08.690
Jordan?

15:14.304 --> 15:16.437
I have nothing more to say.

15:16.437 --> 15:18.047
We just wanna give
you a chance to tell

15:18.047 --> 15:19.353
your side of the story.

15:19.353 --> 15:20.832
I told you.

15:20.832 --> 15:22.530
I recalled Henry Miller's
sentence,

15:22.530 --> 15:24.488
because he had
a terminal brain tumor.

15:24.488 --> 15:27.274
Are you aware that Henry
Miller not only survived

15:27.274 --> 15:29.015
months after his release

15:29.015 --> 15:31.234
but had also
displayed superpowers?

15:32.801 --> 15:34.020
What?

15:34.020 --> 15:35.586
He was the one fightingSuperman

15:35.586 --> 15:37.153
in Hob's Bay.

15:37.153 --> 15:40.156
The damage he caused
is in the tens of millions.

15:46.858 --> 15:49.470
Your Honor,
are you all right?

15:50.862 --> 15:53.256
I've said all I can.

15:53.256 --> 15:55.563
Did someone pressure you
to release him?

15:57.695 --> 15:59.045
I can handle this.

15:59.045 --> 16:00.785
Who the hell are you?

16:00.785 --> 16:02.483
This interview's over.

16:06.661 --> 16:09.098
Oh, wait--okay.
No need to get physical.

16:09.098 --> 16:11.274
Get your hands off me.

16:11.274 --> 16:13.363
I have a message for you.

16:14.886 --> 16:17.498
What's on that phone?
Who do you work for?

16:17.498 --> 16:18.934
You need to leave.

16:18.934 --> 16:21.284
Don't touch me.

16:29.901 --> 16:32.382
Were you ever
gonna tell me?

16:33.601 --> 16:34.732
About what?

16:34.732 --> 16:35.995
Harry's closed.

16:35.995 --> 16:37.822
It's a smoothie place now.

16:37.822 --> 16:39.911
Here, I got you
a banana bedlam.

16:39.911 --> 16:41.522
Great, thanks.

16:42.740 --> 16:44.481
What did you think
I was talking about?

16:44.481 --> 16:46.135
Nothing.
No, I'm just...

16:46.135 --> 16:48.703
trying to figure out
who sent that fixer.

16:50.139 --> 16:53.708
Lois, I know
something's bothering you,

16:53.708 --> 16:55.014
and it's not just this case.

16:55.014 --> 16:57.016
I know-I know
you're in work mode, okay?

16:57.016 --> 16:58.582
I get that.

16:58.582 --> 17:00.497
But whenever, if ever,

17:00.497 --> 17:02.195
you're ready to talk about it,

17:02.195 --> 17:04.197
I'm here for you.

17:05.285 --> 17:07.504
- I know you are.
- I mean it.

17:07.504 --> 17:09.506
We're a team.

17:09.506 --> 17:11.595
Best one I know.

17:15.643 --> 17:17.471
Clark, there he is!
Follow him.

17:17.471 --> 17:20.343
We have to find out
who he works for.

17:20.343 --> 17:21.605
What are you going to do?

17:21.605 --> 17:23.042
I'm gonna wait
for Judge Reagan.

17:23.042 --> 17:24.608
She was about to
tell us something.

17:24.608 --> 17:25.783
Go!

17:28.221 --> 17:31.093
I cannot believe
I just told you that.

17:31.093 --> 17:32.573
No, it's okay.

17:32.573 --> 17:34.836
"Slaughter Cab" used to
give me nightmares, too.

17:34.836 --> 17:35.967
When I was 11.

17:35.967 --> 17:38.405
Oh, you are brutal!

17:38.405 --> 17:40.320
The car was terrifying,
and you know it.

17:40.320 --> 17:42.104
Have you seen "The Bus Stop"?

17:42.104 --> 17:44.324
Have I seen "The Bus Stop"?
Yes, I've seen "Bus Stop."

17:44.324 --> 17:46.021
Did I like "Bus Stop"?
- Also yes!

17:46.021 --> 17:48.763
It completely reinvented the
psychological horror genre.

17:48.763 --> 17:50.504
I mean, the scene
where Gina realizes

17:50.504 --> 17:52.288
the bus stop
is literally purgatory

17:52.288 --> 17:54.464
is one of the most cinematic--

17:55.422 --> 17:57.119
Too much?

17:57.119 --> 17:58.729
No.

17:58.729 --> 18:00.557
No, not at all.

18:00.557 --> 18:03.256
It's just, um...

18:03.256 --> 18:05.780
I really wish
you never left Met High.

18:05.780 --> 18:07.390
What?

18:07.390 --> 18:10.263
When your friend saw me
staring at you earlier,

18:10.263 --> 18:13.266
it's because I recognized you.

18:13.266 --> 18:15.398
- I was only there for a day.
- I know.

18:15.398 --> 18:17.052
I know, and I asked
around about you.

18:17.052 --> 18:19.794
But you never came back.

18:19.794 --> 18:21.752
You just became
this mystery girl

18:21.752 --> 18:23.841
I never thought
I'd see again.

18:23.841 --> 18:26.627
Oh. Well, I...

18:28.542 --> 18:30.674
I'm here now.

18:30.674 --> 18:33.329
I don't have to be
a mystery anymore.

18:34.548 --> 18:36.332
What do you want to know?

18:36.332 --> 18:37.638
<i>What's this?</i>

18:37.638 --> 18:40.380
Like a belated
birthday present?

18:40.380 --> 18:42.382
Yes. And an apology

18:42.382 --> 18:44.949
for ending our relationship
the way I did.

18:44.949 --> 18:46.473
It was no big deal.

18:46.473 --> 18:48.562
No, it was a mistake.

18:48.562 --> 18:51.565
One I've been thinking
about a lot lately.

18:54.698 --> 18:59.007
Wow, Eliza,
this is... really nice.

18:59.007 --> 19:01.836
I know.
I'm glad you like it.

19:03.185 --> 19:05.535
There's one more thing.
Follow me.

19:19.506 --> 19:20.768
Thanks.

19:26.208 --> 19:28.167
I wasn't avoiding you.

19:28.167 --> 19:31.170
I...I didn't even know
you were here.

19:31.170 --> 19:32.954
And I wanted to
give you space.

19:32.954 --> 19:34.303
Jordan, you don't--

19:34.303 --> 19:36.740
you don't need
to give me space. I--

19:36.740 --> 19:39.700
Look, you're the first guy
I've ever dated

19:39.700 --> 19:42.659
that I've wanted
to stay friends with.

19:42.659 --> 19:44.574
This is completely
new for me, too,

19:44.574 --> 19:46.359
and I'm really sorry
if I made you feel like

19:46.359 --> 19:48.317
you have to walk
on eggshells around me.

19:49.318 --> 19:51.364
I mean, it's not
your fault.

19:51.364 --> 19:53.975
I'm kinda
that way around everybody.

19:53.975 --> 19:56.107
But not around your
close friends, and that's...

19:56.107 --> 19:58.153
that's what I want to be.

19:58.153 --> 19:59.937
Best friend.

19:59.937 --> 20:01.548
Same here.

20:02.070 --> 20:03.027
Great.

20:03.027 --> 20:05.378
Then it's settled.

20:09.991 --> 20:11.514
All right, so...

20:11.514 --> 20:12.950
what are we doing now?

20:12.950 --> 20:15.736
Oh, uh...

20:21.611 --> 20:23.004
Didn't you drive here?

20:23.004 --> 20:24.658
Yeah, but I bet these
Metropolis bros

20:24.658 --> 20:26.050
won't mind us
playing water cups

20:26.050 --> 20:29.402
if we put
a little money on the line.

20:32.100 --> 20:34.276
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

20:40.587 --> 20:41.849
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

20:43.764 --> 20:45.896
Yes!

20:50.771 --> 20:52.163
Ohh!

20:52.163 --> 20:53.861
- Yes!
<i>- Sarah's in Metropolis?</i>

20:53.861 --> 20:55.428
I'm sorry.

20:55.428 --> 20:57.256
I thought she had
your permission.

20:57.256 --> 21:00.650
No! She fed me some lie
about a movie marathon.

21:00.650 --> 21:03.784
Okay. if it helps, I told
Nat to be home by midnight.

21:03.784 --> 21:05.786
No, it doesn't.
I need her back now.

21:07.309 --> 21:09.093
I'm sorry, um...

21:09.093 --> 21:10.617
this is not your problem.

21:10.617 --> 21:12.314
No, hey, wait, look.
I, um...

21:12.314 --> 21:14.403
I just finished cooking, okay?

21:14.403 --> 21:16.275
If you're hungry...

21:16.275 --> 21:18.451
I've, uh,
bothered you enough.

21:18.451 --> 21:20.191
No, no, actually,
you'll be doing me a favor.

21:20.191 --> 21:23.064
Nat caught me by surprise
with this Metropolis trip,

21:23.064 --> 21:26.589
and I'd already prepped
the wild mushroom tortellini.

21:32.073 --> 21:34.554
<i>Up there!</i>

21:34.554 --> 21:36.991
<i>She's gonna jump!</i>
- Judge Reagan.

21:42.562 --> 21:44.259
Your Honor?

21:44.259 --> 21:46.305
You shouldn't
have followed me.

21:48.350 --> 21:51.135
Why don't you step down,
and we can go back inside.

21:51.135 --> 21:53.790
I went to work
this morning

21:53.790 --> 21:56.880
like it was just
another normal day.

21:56.880 --> 22:00.928
Then you asked me
about Henry Miller.

22:00.928 --> 22:03.844
And I knew it was the day
I was going to die.

22:12.548 --> 22:14.550
<i>The judge won't be
a problem, sir.</i>

22:14.550 --> 22:16.857
And Lois Lane?

22:16.857 --> 22:18.249
She's got nothing.

22:28.434 --> 22:29.913
Sir.

22:29.913 --> 22:32.351
I apologize. I--

22:32.351 --> 22:34.614
We'll revisit
this later, Mr. Orr.

22:38.226 --> 22:39.749
<i>Superman!</i>

22:47.191 --> 22:49.672
What do you want?

22:56.940 --> 22:59.769
What are you doing
in my neighborhood?

23:02.119 --> 23:05.471
Why'd you have Henry Miller
released from prison?

23:05.471 --> 23:07.342
Is that an accusation?

23:07.342 --> 23:09.213
Just a question.

23:09.213 --> 23:12.608
Why does Superman care about
someone like the Atom Man?

23:12.608 --> 23:14.218
Well, because when
I faced him a week ago,

23:14.218 --> 23:15.916
he had superpowers--

23:15.916 --> 23:17.700
something
he didn't have before.

23:17.700 --> 23:20.790
So you're threatened 'cause
someone else has powers?

23:23.140 --> 23:25.099
Still don't see
what that's got to do with me.

23:25.099 --> 23:28.581
You had Henry Miller
released from prison.

23:29.277 --> 23:31.410
Got proof?

23:31.410 --> 23:33.499
My whole life,
people have been accusing me

23:33.499 --> 23:34.978
of things I haven't done.

23:34.978 --> 23:36.980
Like being
the head of Intergang?

23:36.980 --> 23:38.939
It's a rumor that never dies,

23:38.939 --> 23:43.726
no matter how many times
I try to kill it.

23:43.726 --> 23:46.729
Did you give
Henry Miller powers?

23:46.729 --> 23:50.037
You're the one who dragged
him into my backyard,

23:50.037 --> 23:53.432
destroying things I built
for my community.

23:53.432 --> 23:56.086
And now you stand here
in my home,

23:56.086 --> 23:59.089
accusing me of what?

23:59.089 --> 24:00.439
Playing Dr. Frankenstein?

24:00.439 --> 24:02.528
I still haven't
heard you deny it.

24:05.182 --> 24:08.142
Every few years,
people like Lois Lane

24:08.142 --> 24:12.015
come snooping around Hob's Bay,
trying to make me the villain.

24:13.147 --> 24:15.018
But that story?

24:15.018 --> 24:17.107
Never sticks.

24:17.107 --> 24:19.022
You know why?

24:21.547 --> 24:25.812
Because here,
in my part of Metropolis,

24:25.812 --> 24:29.206
I'm the hero--not you.

24:29.206 --> 24:31.557
I know you're not
the bad guy here.

24:31.557 --> 24:33.515
You don't understand.

24:33.515 --> 24:35.822
Then talk to me.

24:35.822 --> 24:38.868
Make me understand.

24:38.868 --> 24:41.915
I thought if someone like
me could become a judge,

24:41.915 --> 24:44.918
then maybe this world
could become a better place.

24:46.180 --> 24:48.225
Maybe become more fair.

24:48.225 --> 24:52.142
But then I found out how
much the system's rigged.

24:52.142 --> 24:54.275
That's why you
need to fight back.

24:55.755 --> 24:59.498
Whoever did this,
don't let him win.

25:01.108 --> 25:04.241
I can protect you.
We can stop them.

25:06.896 --> 25:08.855
Some people
are just unstoppable.

25:08.855 --> 25:10.944
No, please!
Don't give up!

25:10.944 --> 25:13.337
Please let me help you!

25:15.383 --> 25:17.820
I can't believe
this is vegan.

25:17.820 --> 25:20.127
Mm-hmm. When you, um...

25:20.127 --> 25:22.651
when you have a very
principled 15-year-old,

25:22.651 --> 25:24.305
you learn your substitutions.

25:26.916 --> 25:28.178
Thanks.

25:28.178 --> 25:30.224
I needed that.

25:31.617 --> 25:33.793
I have been so overwhelmed
with work lately,

25:33.793 --> 25:37.274
I didn't even notice
Sarah was lying to me.

25:37.274 --> 25:39.233
And getting that call...

25:40.539 --> 25:43.411
I was on the phone
with him, John.

25:43.411 --> 25:45.544
I heard it happen.

25:45.544 --> 25:47.458
Uh,

25:47.458 --> 25:50.244
that would rattle anyone.

25:50.244 --> 25:52.246
He was so afraid.

25:53.595 --> 25:56.772
He was saying something about...

25:56.772 --> 25:59.906
the pride of Smallville.

25:59.906 --> 26:03.649
I think he was telling me
that that's how...

26:03.649 --> 26:06.216
he wanted to be remembered.

26:07.304 --> 26:08.958
The pride of Smallville?

26:08.958 --> 26:11.613
Have you heard that
anywhere before?

26:13.659 --> 26:15.182
No.

26:15.182 --> 26:17.576
Not that I can think of.

26:17.576 --> 26:19.099
Hmm...

26:20.361 --> 26:21.841
But I have read it.

26:21.841 --> 26:26.410
The town seal in my office--

26:26.410 --> 26:27.760
"the Pride of Smallville."

26:27.760 --> 26:30.589
Let's go.

26:35.376 --> 26:37.596
I really missed this.

26:38.553 --> 26:40.599
Sitting here talking to you.

26:40.599 --> 26:42.078
Yeah.

26:42.078 --> 26:43.950
It's cool to be
hanging out again.

26:49.303 --> 26:53.176
Wait, I've-I've-I've
got a girlfriend.

26:53.176 --> 26:56.179
But you've been texting
me this whole week.

26:56.179 --> 26:58.181
And you drove all the way
to Metropolis to see me.

26:58.181 --> 27:01.532
Well, yeah, because I
thought we were friends.

27:01.532 --> 27:03.360
Seriously?

27:03.360 --> 27:05.145
We've never been just friends.

27:07.016 --> 27:09.845
I won't tell anyone, if that's
what you're worried about.

27:12.892 --> 27:14.720
I made a mistake.

27:17.505 --> 27:19.681
I'm so sorry.

27:22.510 --> 27:23.467
- Yeah!
- Yay!

27:23.467 --> 27:25.078
- Yes!
- Uhh!

27:25.078 --> 27:26.427
Ah... lost again.

27:26.427 --> 27:27.820
Pay up.

27:33.869 --> 27:36.698
God, Metropolis money
just spends better.

27:36.698 --> 27:38.352
You two aren't even drinking,

27:38.352 --> 27:40.920
and now you wanna
run your mouth?

27:40.920 --> 27:43.183
I don't even know you.
What are you doing here?

27:43.183 --> 27:44.793
Just trying to
have a good time.

27:44.793 --> 27:46.447
Wait, are you
wearing her flannel?

27:46.447 --> 27:48.188
He's probably gonna
borrow her panties next.

27:48.188 --> 27:50.016
Say that again.

27:50.016 --> 27:51.408
Hey, come on, Sarah.

27:51.408 --> 27:52.845
Hey, you still owe me
a drink from earlier.

27:52.845 --> 27:54.368
Why don't you go
fetch me a beer?

27:54.368 --> 27:56.196
Yeah, you could
be our beer bitch.

27:56.196 --> 27:58.372
He's not
getting you crap.

27:59.852 --> 28:02.376
Hey, hey, what's going on?

28:03.116 --> 28:04.683
Get moving, beer bitch.

28:04.683 --> 28:06.206
Ooh!

28:06.206 --> 28:08.077
You never had
a boyfriend?

28:08.077 --> 28:10.689
Okay, your standards must be
like through the roof then.

28:10.689 --> 28:13.430
I mean, maybe
a little above average.

28:13.430 --> 28:14.649
Come on!

28:14.649 --> 28:16.129
I mean, you're smart, funny,

28:16.129 --> 28:19.567
and, like, model-level
gorgeous.

28:19.567 --> 28:23.310
I mean, you must be turning
guys down left and right.

28:23.310 --> 28:24.615
Well, I...

28:24.615 --> 28:27.706
I wouldn't turn down
every guy who asked me out.

28:27.706 --> 28:28.924
Really?

28:28.924 --> 28:30.404
- Get moving, beer bitch.
- Uh...

28:30.404 --> 28:31.710
- Ooh!
- Ooh!

28:31.710 --> 28:33.320
Screw you,
you privileged prick!

28:33.320 --> 28:36.758
Uh, I have to go.
Just don't move.

28:37.803 --> 28:40.240
I said, get me a beer,

28:40.240 --> 28:42.068
or you and your
hillbilly girlfriend

28:42.068 --> 28:45.158
can get the hell outta here.

28:45.158 --> 28:48.335
Oh, you want a beer?
You want a beer?

28:48.335 --> 28:49.510
Mm-hmm.

28:50.076 --> 28:52.643
- Oh!
- Ooh!

28:52.643 --> 28:54.341
Here's your beer, bitch.

28:56.299 --> 28:59.607
- Get the hell outta my house!
- And we'd better go!

28:59.607 --> 29:01.827
Those jerkoffs deserve way
more than beer in their face.

29:01.827 --> 29:03.480
I got an idea.
I got an idea.

29:06.701 --> 29:08.921
The Pride of Smallville.

29:08.921 --> 29:10.879
You think there's
something behind there?

29:10.879 --> 29:13.752
Yeah, let's, uh...
let's see.

29:29.637 --> 29:31.595
Any idea what could
be on that?

29:31.595 --> 29:32.858
Not a clue.

29:32.858 --> 29:35.774
But we can look.

29:48.917 --> 29:50.005
What's-what's going on?

29:50.005 --> 29:51.572
It's what I heard

29:51.572 --> 29:53.313
right before Dean was killed!

29:54.662 --> 29:55.881
John!

30:03.932 --> 30:04.977
Who the hell is that?

30:04.977 --> 30:06.979
Aah!

30:08.894 --> 30:10.330
Get down!

30:33.570 --> 30:35.834
Ah...

30:54.548 --> 30:55.549
You okay?

30:57.856 --> 31:01.381
You know what they called
this area when I was a kid?

31:03.513 --> 31:05.254
The suicide slums.

31:07.126 --> 31:10.042
'Cause people around
here started to lose hope,

31:10.042 --> 31:13.001
and they started
taking their own lives.

31:14.263 --> 31:16.918
I had a front-row seat.

31:16.918 --> 31:19.051
I'd watch people
like Lex Luthor

31:19.051 --> 31:22.663
and Morgan Edge
become billionaires

31:22.663 --> 31:24.883
while my community was choked.

31:29.844 --> 31:34.327
I learned at a very early age,

31:34.327 --> 31:37.243
no one was gonna
come here to save us.

31:39.332 --> 31:42.596
So I became the
person they looked to.

31:42.596 --> 31:45.599
I transformed this community.

31:45.599 --> 31:47.601
I gave my people hope.

31:48.950 --> 31:50.734
I made real change.

31:50.734 --> 31:53.041
I didn't just put out fires.

31:54.303 --> 31:56.697
That's what you think I do?

31:56.697 --> 32:00.396
The whole time
you've been on this planet,

32:00.396 --> 32:03.312
you haven't changed
a damn thing.

32:04.661 --> 32:06.489
I save people's lives.

32:08.970 --> 32:11.451
Not here, you didn't.

32:13.366 --> 32:16.456
No, please, don't give up!

32:19.546 --> 32:22.244
I don't have
any other choice!

32:29.164 --> 32:31.471
There is always
another choice.

32:33.168 --> 32:35.127
Not this time.

32:35.127 --> 32:37.129
<i>It's too late to save me.</i>

32:38.782 --> 32:40.045
See?

32:40.045 --> 32:42.090
Another fire.

32:43.570 --> 32:45.180
We're not done.

32:45.180 --> 32:48.618
Oh... we're done.

32:50.011 --> 32:52.318
And never stepped foot
in my house again,

32:52.318 --> 32:55.147
acting like
you're better than me.

33:00.630 --> 33:02.632
We can get through this
together, Judge Reagan.

33:02.632 --> 33:06.985
I promise you we can
get you some help.

33:06.985 --> 33:08.725
There's no helping me now.

33:08.725 --> 33:11.641
What's coming for me--

33:11.641 --> 33:13.513
it's uncontrollable.

33:15.863 --> 33:17.778
I know what that feels like.

33:19.910 --> 33:21.782
Facing something uncontrollable.

33:25.003 --> 33:27.353
Not knowing whether there's
anything you can do

33:27.353 --> 33:30.182
that will ultimately
even make a difference.

33:32.184 --> 33:34.012
I understand that fear.

33:34.012 --> 33:36.623
How could you possibly
understand that?

33:36.623 --> 33:40.670
Because I'm facing
something uncontrollable, too.

33:49.070 --> 33:51.159
I just found out
I have cancer...

33:54.684 --> 33:56.512
And it's aggressive.

33:58.036 --> 34:02.040
And all day, I've been
trying to hang on to hope,

34:02.040 --> 34:05.217
but it's really hard,
because I'm really scared.

34:07.523 --> 34:10.352
But what I know
or what I believe

34:10.352 --> 34:15.836
is that the only way
to take back control

34:15.836 --> 34:18.273
is to fight.

34:19.492 --> 34:21.755
If I can do it,
you can do it, too.

34:24.932 --> 34:28.109
You're much stronger
than you think you are.

35:02.622 --> 35:05.451
Help her inside.
I'll be right there.

35:37.004 --> 35:39.441
<i>I didn't have a lump.</i>

35:39.441 --> 35:41.139
I'm young.
The swelling could've been

35:41.139 --> 35:43.358
a dozen different things.

35:43.358 --> 35:45.665
And since I couldn't give
my full family history,

35:45.665 --> 35:47.928
'cause of my mom,

35:47.928 --> 35:51.366
Dr. Irons wanted to be sure,
and she expedited the biopsy.

35:58.939 --> 36:01.550
I have inflammatory
breast cancer.

36:04.510 --> 36:06.990
It's rare and aggressive,
and it's hard to detect,

36:06.990 --> 36:09.341
but they did,
so there's that.

36:12.605 --> 36:14.172
I should have told you sooner.

36:14.172 --> 36:15.956
What? No.

36:17.218 --> 36:19.177
You have nothing
to apologize for.

36:21.353 --> 36:23.572
I just wanted to
process it on my own.

36:25.313 --> 36:27.228
I didn't want to scare you.

36:29.535 --> 36:32.364
And I didn't want you to
look at me like I was sick.

36:32.364 --> 36:34.366
Come here, come here.

36:40.459 --> 36:44.724
You are the strongest
person I know.

36:47.292 --> 36:52.427
I promise you, I will never
look at you any other way.

36:52.427 --> 36:55.038
I'm not ready for
everything to change.

36:55.038 --> 36:56.910
Come here.

36:59.782 --> 37:02.916
We are gonna
get through this together.

37:02.916 --> 37:05.832
You're not gonna go to any
more doctor's visits alone.

37:08.095 --> 37:11.272
You're gonna beat this thing.

37:11.272 --> 37:13.318
There's not a doubt in my mind.

37:21.456 --> 37:23.328
Now that the
adrenaline's worn off,

37:23.328 --> 37:26.766
I should probably apologize
for ruining everyone's day.

37:26.766 --> 37:28.768
Apologize?

37:28.768 --> 37:31.640
Dude, that was the coolest
thing I've ever seen.

37:31.640 --> 37:33.555
Good.

37:33.555 --> 37:35.340
Nat, did you at least
get Matteo's number?

37:35.340 --> 37:37.646
There'll be other guys.

37:37.646 --> 37:38.995
Aw.

37:51.704 --> 37:53.053
And?

37:55.882 --> 37:57.840
You froze his car?

37:57.840 --> 37:59.799
- That's awesome!
- Oh my God!

38:05.108 --> 38:06.458
Sarah, what's wrong?

38:11.767 --> 38:13.682
How long has he
been like this?

38:13.682 --> 38:15.249
24 hours.

38:15.249 --> 38:16.946
It's only getting worse.

38:16.946 --> 38:19.035
Enough!

38:40.405 --> 38:42.842
I told you
it wasn't going to work.

38:42.842 --> 38:46.367
I'm not done.
That was only one trial.

38:46.367 --> 38:48.630
Something happened
in Smallville.

38:48.630 --> 38:51.198
- Idiot mayor.
- Not him. He's dead.

38:51.198 --> 38:53.374
But John Henry Irons isn't.

38:53.374 --> 38:55.420
You killed him.

38:55.420 --> 38:57.770
I know.

39:01.904 --> 39:03.341
Mom, are you okay?

39:03.341 --> 39:04.864
Yeah, I'm fine.

39:04.864 --> 39:08.650
Sir Irons is putting in
a new security system for us.

39:08.650 --> 39:10.783
Look, I'm really sorry.

39:10.783 --> 39:12.611
No, we will talk
about that later.

39:12.611 --> 39:14.439
You're hurt.

39:14.439 --> 39:16.266
No, I'm--
I'll be all right.

39:16.266 --> 39:18.356
I'll come back later and
get everything else set up,

39:18.356 --> 39:20.183
but you should be
good for the night.

39:20.183 --> 39:23.839
My sensors detect anything,
I'll be here in seconds.

39:23.839 --> 39:25.624
Great.

39:25.624 --> 39:27.234
Come on.
We should get home.

39:27.234 --> 39:29.628
Oh, I can--
I can show 'em out.

39:32.021 --> 39:33.371
John?

39:35.416 --> 39:37.070
Thank you.

39:43.946 --> 39:47.385
<i>- Are they still awake?
- Yeah they're in the kitchen.</i>

39:47.385 --> 39:49.909
Hey,

39:49.909 --> 39:51.737
just tell them you got
turned around again.

39:51.737 --> 39:54.392
Bro, pretty sure that
excuse only works once.

40:02.269 --> 40:04.663
What's going on?

40:04.663 --> 40:06.404
Boys, you need to sit down.

40:08.231 --> 40:10.190
Guys, your mom has something
she wants to tell you,

40:10.190 --> 40:12.932
but before she does,
I just want you both to know

40:12.932 --> 40:16.979
that we are going to get
through this as a family.

40:25.771 --> 40:27.250
I was just diagnosed

40:27.250 --> 40:29.818
with stage-three
inflammatory breast cancer.

41:48.680 --> 41:50.638
Brett, move your head.
