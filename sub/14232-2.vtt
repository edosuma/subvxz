00:44.778 --> 00:46.712
I like red,
I like hoodies.

00:46.714 --> 00:48.280
So I bought
a dozen of them.

00:48.282 --> 00:49.782
JUSTIN: Hey,
it's that magic girl!

00:49.784 --> 00:51.283
( indistinct chattering )

00:51.285 --> 00:52.317
LARRY: Hey,
what's up, Star?

00:52.319 --> 00:54.553
Hi, new friends.
Hi!

00:54.555 --> 00:56.321
Everyone's
so cool here, Marco.

00:56.323 --> 00:59.625
had tossed me out
of the castle years ago.

00:59.627 --> 01:01.860
Oh, you haven't even met
the coolest guys.

01:01.862 --> 01:03.695
<i>Alfonzo and Ferguson.</i>

01:03.697 --> 01:05.731
Quick,
here she comes.

01:05.733 --> 01:07.232
Hey, hey.
Are those books?

01:07.234 --> 01:08.267
Where are you going
with those books?

01:08.269 --> 01:09.568
Do you like to read?

01:10.603 --> 01:12.237
Oh, dear.

01:12.239 --> 01:13.672
They're usually cooler.

01:13.674 --> 01:16.275
I need to fix
Ferguson up.

01:16.277 --> 01:17.609
No.

01:19.345 --> 01:20.646
( gasps )

01:20.648 --> 01:23.649
Jackie Lynn Thomas!

01:23.651 --> 01:25.284
Hey, Star Butterfly.

01:25.286 --> 01:26.718
Hi, Jackie!

01:28.788 --> 01:30.722
I need to fix you up.

01:30.724 --> 01:31.723
What?

01:31.725 --> 01:33.292
Oh, come on.

01:33.294 --> 01:34.593
I'm almost as good
at matchmaking

01:34.595 --> 01:35.794
as I am with magic.

01:38.298 --> 01:39.598
I'm good.

01:42.268 --> 01:44.636
Look, look, look, look,
look! It's my name.
It's my name.

01:44.638 --> 01:46.805
With a star
inside of a butterfly

01:46.807 --> 01:49.675
and two hearts and a spider.

01:51.711 --> 01:53.612
As you can see, class,

01:53.614 --> 01:56.682
most of you have
done a pathetic job.

01:56.684 --> 01:58.650
Not me!

01:58.652 --> 02:01.420
I got an "F"
for fantastic!

02:01.422 --> 02:03.789
That's an "F" for fail.

02:03.791 --> 02:05.324
Huh?

02:05.326 --> 02:07.693
What? You don't have
tests on Mewni?

02:07.695 --> 02:09.728
Uh...

02:09.730 --> 02:11.296
So what grade
did you get?

02:11.298 --> 02:13.398
Only the best grade
you can get.

02:13.400 --> 02:15.868
A-plus,
with a smiley face.

02:17.403 --> 02:20.305
Ooh, I want
the best one, too.

02:20.307 --> 02:21.740
Wait, don't!

02:21.742 --> 02:23.809
Oh, Miss Skullnick!

02:25.345 --> 02:26.778
( grunting )

02:26.780 --> 02:29.348
Hey, Skullzie!

02:29.350 --> 02:32.351
Can you please
do me a teeny favor

02:32.353 --> 02:34.353
and turn my "F"
into an "A"?

02:34.355 --> 02:36.255
You're whining
about a lousy grade?

02:36.257 --> 02:38.390
I'd finally got
a guy with a boat,

02:38.392 --> 02:40.325
and he left me
at the dock.

02:40.327 --> 02:41.793
A dock?

02:41.795 --> 02:43.395
The dock isn't
the important part.

02:44.664 --> 02:46.732
I guess I'm doomed
to dry land.

02:46.734 --> 02:48.400
I got it!

02:48.402 --> 02:50.736
I'll cast a spell to
get you the perfect guy,

02:50.738 --> 02:52.804
and you can give me
the perfect grade.

02:52.806 --> 02:54.339
What?
Man--

02:54.341 --> 02:55.807
Wait!
Left arm!

02:57.744 --> 02:59.344
( gasps )

02:59.346 --> 03:01.346
Star,
what did you do?

03:01.348 --> 03:03.849
I think I turned her
into a troll.

03:05.385 --> 03:07.352
Star Butterfly rules!

03:07.354 --> 03:09.288
( cheering )

03:09.290 --> 03:10.389
( screaming )

03:10.391 --> 03:12.291
I'm hideous!

03:12.293 --> 03:13.759
Quick!
Change her back.

03:13.761 --> 03:15.327
Oh, okay...
yeah, right...

03:16.262 --> 03:17.296
Okay, yeah.

03:17.298 --> 03:18.430
Lightning Change Back!

03:26.839 --> 03:28.373
Where are we?

03:28.375 --> 03:29.808
You just zapped us
back to the house!

03:31.444 --> 03:33.345
I wish I knew
how I did that.

03:33.347 --> 03:35.380
It could really come
in handy if I don't feel

03:35.382 --> 03:36.782
like using my legs.

03:47.860 --> 03:50.329
Ludo, Master.

03:50.331 --> 03:53.732
Star Butterfly has come home
from school early today

03:53.734 --> 03:56.368
and she seems distracted.

03:57.770 --> 03:59.504
Distracted?

03:59.506 --> 04:01.373
Excellent!

04:01.375 --> 04:03.775
This is the moment
I've been waiting for.

04:03.777 --> 04:08.480
No one's at their best
when they're distracted!

04:11.417 --> 04:12.818
Finally!

04:12.820 --> 04:15.520
I'll get my hands
on that glorious wand!

04:15.522 --> 04:18.757
When it transforms,
it will match my hat.

04:18.759 --> 04:20.826
And I'll get my big boy body.

04:22.395 --> 04:23.428
Kick down the tower.

04:23.430 --> 04:25.330
Zip, zap, zip, zip.

04:25.332 --> 04:26.865
And I'm a lifeguard.

04:26.867 --> 04:28.767
One, two, three...

04:30.370 --> 04:31.837
Is that CPR?

04:31.839 --> 04:33.538
Silence!

04:33.540 --> 04:36.441
Yes, unfortunately,
I was too late.

04:38.444 --> 04:40.445
Please don't cry,
Miss Skullnick.

04:40.447 --> 04:42.381
Star, we can't
keep stalling.

04:42.383 --> 04:43.548
You're gonna have
to call your mom.

04:43.550 --> 04:45.784
She'll know how
to reverse the spell.

04:45.786 --> 04:47.786
No!
I can't ask for help.

04:47.788 --> 04:50.856
If my parents
find out about this,
they're gonna send me to...

04:50.858 --> 04:54.559
<i>Saint Olga's Reform School</i>
<i>for Wayward Princesses.</i>

04:54.561 --> 04:56.461
<i>It's a terrible,</i>
<i>horrible place</i>

04:56.463 --> 04:58.497
<i>and no one who goes there</i>
<i>ever comes out the same!</i>

04:58.499 --> 04:59.831
( screaming )

05:02.602 --> 05:03.802
Is it all out yet?

05:03.804 --> 05:04.903
Almost.

05:06.839 --> 05:10.375
Okay, I'm done.
Look, Star, you just
need to get the information

05:10.377 --> 05:12.311
without letting her know
what's going on.

05:12.313 --> 05:14.546
You know,
dance around the truth.

05:14.548 --> 05:17.349
I'm a great dancer.

05:21.487 --> 05:23.488
Mirror,
Mirror on the wall...

05:23.490 --> 05:24.556
Call Mom.

05:24.558 --> 05:25.857
<i>MIRROR: Calling Tom.</i>

05:26.859 --> 05:28.827
Star!
No. No.

05:28.829 --> 05:30.495
Oh, wait.
You're here. I'm here--

05:30.497 --> 05:32.564
I said, call Mom,
not Tom.

05:32.566 --> 05:34.433
No, Star.
Don't hang up.

05:35.501 --> 05:37.502
I really got to delete
him off my mirror.

05:37.504 --> 05:40.372
Oh, Star, darling,
what a pleasant surprise!

05:40.374 --> 05:41.573
So, Mom.

05:41.575 --> 05:43.575
Let's just say that
someone accidentally

05:43.577 --> 05:45.377
turned someone
into a troll with a wand.

05:45.379 --> 05:47.379
Not that
I would do that, no,

05:47.381 --> 05:48.847
because that would be
completely irresponsible--

05:48.849 --> 05:49.915
( thud )

05:51.317 --> 05:52.384
Star,
what is going on?

05:52.386 --> 05:54.319
Got to go, bye.
What happened?

05:54.321 --> 05:55.921
She jumped
out the window.

05:58.858 --> 06:01.360
Wow,
good job, Marco.

06:01.362 --> 06:03.862
LUDO: Wow,
good job, Marco.

06:03.864 --> 06:05.864
Ludo, what are you
doing here?

06:05.866 --> 06:10.302
Catching you
at your most distracted!
What?

06:10.304 --> 06:12.437
I have been way more
distracted than this.

06:12.439 --> 06:15.507
I don't know,
you seem pretty distracted.

06:15.509 --> 06:16.875
Nah, not really.

06:16.877 --> 06:18.477
Oh, well...

06:18.479 --> 06:19.544
What's that over there?

06:19.546 --> 06:20.545
What?
Where?

06:20.547 --> 06:21.646
Get her!

06:32.492 --> 06:35.427
Dagger Crystal
Heart Attack!

06:35.429 --> 06:36.962
Feel the love.

06:39.665 --> 06:42.300
I'm obligated
to warn you,

06:42.302 --> 06:44.503
I'm a green belt
with a stripe.

07:07.527 --> 07:08.660
Rainbow Blast!

07:26.345 --> 07:27.612
Narwhal Blast!

07:27.614 --> 07:28.713
Narwhal Blast!

07:31.651 --> 07:33.552
Narwhal blast.

07:34.687 --> 07:38.323
Well, uh, I should
probably be getting back.

07:38.325 --> 07:41.693
Kids ain't gonna fight
themselves, you know.

07:41.695 --> 07:43.728
Maybe I'll see you
around sometime.

07:48.501 --> 07:50.335
Hey, Marco, you can
handle this for a minute

07:50.337 --> 07:51.336
on your own, right?

07:51.338 --> 07:52.471
Oh, yeah, no problem.

07:52.473 --> 07:54.406
Cool, thanks!

07:54.408 --> 07:55.507
Wait...

07:58.377 --> 08:00.378
Oh, Miss Skullnick!

08:00.380 --> 08:01.480
What?

08:01.482 --> 08:02.647
See that monster
over there?

08:06.452 --> 08:07.586
He thinks you're cute.

08:07.588 --> 08:09.454
Really?

08:09.456 --> 08:11.656
Ooh, what should I do?
Wait right here.

08:11.658 --> 08:14.726
Hey there, Monster Guy.
See that troll over there?

08:18.664 --> 08:19.698
Star!

08:19.700 --> 08:21.433
Get him!
Get him!

08:21.435 --> 08:23.568
Hey, guys!
I think you forgot something.

08:24.670 --> 08:26.438
Get the wand!

08:27.507 --> 08:30.542
Turbo Nuclear
Butterfly Blast!

08:32.545 --> 08:34.446
Not again!

08:48.461 --> 08:51.563
Get up! Get up!

08:53.633 --> 08:56.468
Told you
I wasn't distract--

08:56.470 --> 08:58.470
Wait, did I just
kill that guy?

08:58.472 --> 09:00.438
No, he's not dead.

09:00.440 --> 09:02.641
He's probably just
bleeding internally

09:02.643 --> 09:04.609
and being a total
baby about it.

09:06.579 --> 09:09.447
Open--

09:09.449 --> 09:10.715
Get up you, dipsticks.

09:16.489 --> 09:18.657
MISS SKULLNICK:
Ooh, you're so muscle-y.

09:22.395 --> 09:26.364
So now that I hooked
you up, how about that "A"?

09:26.366 --> 09:30.602
I'd give you an "A plus"
if I was still a teacher.

09:30.604 --> 09:33.705
I'm setting sail
with Captain Triceps here.

09:36.642 --> 09:38.376
What about my "A"?

09:38.378 --> 09:39.678
Try studying.

09:43.549 --> 09:46.451
So anyway,
long story short,

09:46.453 --> 09:48.386
Skullnick ran off with
this weird man-bull-guy thing

09:48.388 --> 09:49.421
to another dimension.

09:49.423 --> 09:52.357
And now
she is gone forever!

09:52.359 --> 09:54.359
Star Butterfly rules!

09:54.361 --> 09:55.460
( cheering )

09:58.431 --> 10:00.665
Wow, Star,
that is so rad, girl.

10:00.667 --> 10:04.469
Thanks,
but actually it's Marco

10:04.471 --> 10:07.405
who deserves
all the credit.

10:07.407 --> 10:08.440
Really?

10:08.442 --> 10:09.708
That's awesome!

10:21.487 --> 10:25.490
Miss Skullnick?
He dumped me, I think.
I don't know.

10:25.492 --> 10:27.525
I couldn't understand
a word he was saying.

10:27.527 --> 10:29.561
Welcome back,
Skullzers.

10:29.563 --> 10:32.530
Get ready
for the worst pop quiz

10:32.532 --> 10:34.399
of your lives!

10:34.401 --> 10:35.500
TOGETHER: Oh, man.

10:42.441 --> 10:46.645
Sorry, Marco.
I didn't mean to embarrass
you in front of Jackie.

10:46.647 --> 10:50.482
Are you kidding?
That's the most
she's ever talked to me!

10:52.418 --> 10:55.353
Then that means
I'm even better

10:55.355 --> 10:57.489
at matchmaking
than I am with magic.

11:05.631 --> 11:08.366
STAR: Oh, my gosh.
I can't wait. I can't wait.

11:08.368 --> 11:10.402
My very first pep rally.

11:10.404 --> 11:12.604
I am so excited.

11:12.606 --> 11:13.672
When aren't
you excited?

11:13.674 --> 11:15.507
Shh.

11:15.509 --> 11:17.509
And now, Brittany Wong,

11:17.511 --> 11:19.477
who became head cheerleader
on her own

11:19.479 --> 11:23.348
and not because her dad
made a generous
donation to the school.

11:23.350 --> 11:25.650
TOGETHER:
Go, Echo Creek!
Let's try not to get beat!

11:25.652 --> 11:28.553
Go, Echo Creek!
Let's try not to get beat!

11:28.555 --> 11:30.722
Go, go, go, go, yeah!

11:33.526 --> 11:34.626
Make some noise
if you love

11:34.628 --> 11:36.494
the Awesome Opossums!

11:36.496 --> 11:38.630
I love opossums.

11:38.632 --> 11:41.433
They carry their babies
on their backs.

11:41.435 --> 11:43.635
You know she's talking
about our football team, right?

11:43.637 --> 11:46.471
We're going up against
the Warriors.

11:46.473 --> 11:49.641
Warriors?
Our rivals
from Silver Hill Prep.

11:49.643 --> 11:52.577
Every year
their team slaughters our guys.

11:52.579 --> 11:55.513
It's gonna be
a bloodbath.

11:56.716 --> 11:58.616
That's terrible!

11:58.618 --> 12:00.385
We must do something!

12:00.387 --> 12:02.487
Well, you could
join the Spirit Committee.

12:02.489 --> 12:03.788
Those kids are relentless

12:03.790 --> 12:04.723
when it comes
to supporting the team.

12:04.725 --> 12:06.691
Opossums!

12:08.627 --> 12:10.428
Relentless.

12:10.430 --> 12:11.563
What a great idea.

12:11.565 --> 12:13.598
We better pick up
some supplies.

12:13.600 --> 12:17.602
As fun as that sounds,
you can go without me.

12:17.604 --> 12:18.703
Okay.

12:20.573 --> 12:22.540
Hey, Sculzy, what's
your favorite weapon?

12:22.542 --> 12:23.641
Battle axe.

12:25.578 --> 12:27.445
And now,
our new mascot,

12:27.447 --> 12:30.582
that I never approved of,
the Awesome Opossum.

12:30.584 --> 12:32.383
All right!

12:32.385 --> 12:34.519
Come on, Opossum--
No.

12:34.521 --> 12:35.720
Where's
the real possum?

12:35.722 --> 12:37.655
Did the Warriors
steal it again?

12:37.657 --> 12:41.826
Those jerks.
Sadly, the real possum
wasn't playing possum.

12:45.498 --> 12:49.501
I hiss, I bite,
I shake my tail like that!

12:49.503 --> 12:51.503
Hey, that's Ferguson!

12:51.505 --> 12:54.706
He's our new mascot.
Oh, no!

12:54.708 --> 12:57.475
That means the Warriors
are gonna steal him!

12:57.477 --> 12:59.377
Oh, that's silly.

12:59.379 --> 13:00.512
The only thing
that's silly

13:00.514 --> 13:01.713
is how the Warriors
are gonna look

13:01.715 --> 13:03.748
when they try
to steal my friend!

13:11.724 --> 13:17.562
So many brave young men,
so many tragic losses.

13:27.439 --> 13:29.440
Alpha Team One,
commencing security sweep

13:29.442 --> 13:30.608
for the Warriors, over.

13:35.581 --> 13:37.448
Oh, Marco.

13:38.717 --> 13:43.388
How can we prevent another
tragic loss to our team?

13:43.390 --> 13:46.524
Well, if I knew
anything about football,
I'd use the element of surprise.

13:46.526 --> 13:48.459
Of course,
of course, of course.
Surprise them.

13:48.461 --> 13:50.428
Bring out
the kitty cat outfits.
Yes!

13:50.430 --> 13:53.398
Maybe even throw
a couple of big bombs.
Bombs!

13:53.400 --> 13:54.599
Yeah, I've got to go tell
that to the Spirit Committee.

13:54.601 --> 13:55.667
Bye.

13:57.736 --> 13:58.770
We have an all clear.

13:58.772 --> 14:01.472
Move! Move! Move!

14:01.474 --> 14:03.474
This is not
the respect a guy

14:03.476 --> 14:05.710
in a possum suit deserves.

14:05.712 --> 14:08.413
<i>BRITTANY:</i>
<i>Don't worry, Sabrina.</i>

14:08.415 --> 14:09.747
<i>The spirit boys</i>
<i>are gonna catch you.</i>

14:09.749 --> 14:11.482
Grow some pom-poms.

14:15.621 --> 14:16.654
What the--

14:16.656 --> 14:17.822
Do these explode?

14:24.396 --> 14:26.431
We're kind of
in the middle of something.

14:26.433 --> 14:28.700
You're the leader?
What's the plan?

14:29.768 --> 14:32.470
This year,
we have a secret weapon.

14:32.472 --> 14:33.605
We're gonna distract them

14:33.607 --> 14:35.707
with our booty-shaking
dance moves.

14:36.775 --> 14:38.776
Do you know
nothing of combat?

14:38.778 --> 14:41.746
No Warrior's gonna be distracted
by Chandelle's booty.

14:41.748 --> 14:44.782
What?
Lucky for you,
my mom assigned

14:44.784 --> 14:47.552
the Royal Guards
as my babysitters.

14:47.554 --> 14:49.454
You know
you've done it right,

14:49.456 --> 14:51.456
when you hear the neck snap.

14:53.459 --> 14:55.460
Yay!

14:56.729 --> 14:58.763
I know
on planet Moo-ni,

14:58.765 --> 15:00.431
or wherever
it is you're from,

15:00.433 --> 15:02.567
it may be okay
to be stupid,

15:02.569 --> 15:05.737
but no pesky magical foreigner
is gonna question my leadership.

15:05.739 --> 15:08.606
You are officially banned
from the Spirit Committee.

15:08.608 --> 15:11.542
Fine.
It looks like
it's all up to me.

15:12.544 --> 15:14.512
Okay,
thanks for coming out.

15:14.514 --> 15:15.713
Come back never!

15:15.715 --> 15:18.416
Okay, if a Warrior
tries to kidnap you,

15:18.418 --> 15:21.619
blow on this stranger
danger whistle.
This is ridiculous.

15:21.621 --> 15:24.756
I just wanted to dress up like
a possum to pick up on ladies.

15:24.758 --> 15:27.492
Hey, this whistle's
gonna save your life!

15:27.494 --> 15:28.660
Put it in your mouth!
Do it!

15:28.662 --> 15:29.727
No!
Blow it!

15:29.729 --> 15:30.695
Never!
You get it away from me.

15:30.697 --> 15:31.763
Let me hear you blow.

15:34.600 --> 15:37.669
You guys ready to be
part of my kitty cat offense?

15:40.739 --> 15:42.540
Oh, fine.

15:42.542 --> 15:45.743
Then I guess we got
to do this the hard way.

15:45.745 --> 15:46.811
Kitty!

15:51.583 --> 15:52.650
I got you now!

15:57.790 --> 15:59.624
Why can't I go home?

15:59.626 --> 16:01.726
Dude, it's Taco Wednesday,
it's a day

16:01.728 --> 16:03.761
we eat all the leftovers
from Taco Tuesday!

16:03.763 --> 16:05.596
Because your house
would be the first place

16:05.598 --> 16:07.632
the Warriors would look
when they try to kidnap you!

16:07.634 --> 16:09.767
It kind of feels
like you're trying to kidnap me.

16:09.769 --> 16:11.536
I'd watch that talk

16:11.538 --> 16:13.504
if you ever want to see
your parents again!

16:16.475 --> 16:19.610
Hey, Marco, do you have
any highly flammable liquids?

16:19.612 --> 16:21.546
I don't know.
Check the garage.

16:21.548 --> 16:22.747
Cool.
Thanks.

16:24.550 --> 16:26.751
All right--
Man, I bet I could
get a lot of action

16:26.753 --> 16:27.785
if I had
a real prehensile tail.

16:27.787 --> 16:29.487
Oh, yeah.

16:29.489 --> 16:30.822
Hey, ladies,
you care for a drink?

16:38.697 --> 16:40.765
Two, four, six,
eight, distract them

16:40.767 --> 16:42.567
with our booty shake.

16:42.569 --> 16:43.668
Oh, oh.

16:55.748 --> 16:58.649
It's almost game
time and thanks to me,

16:58.651 --> 17:00.752
no Warriors have even
gotten close to you.

17:02.755 --> 17:06.524
Who's ready for a bloody,
bloody, bloodbath?

17:09.261 --> 17:11.229
What's with that
crazed look in your eyes?

17:11.231 --> 17:12.530
What do you mean?

17:12.532 --> 17:13.698
Watch, Ferguson.

17:13.700 --> 17:14.932
I need to talk
to Princess Cuckoo Pants.

17:18.804 --> 17:20.772
FERGUSON: Stranger danger.
Stranger danger!

17:20.774 --> 17:22.807
( whistling )

17:22.809 --> 17:24.809
Okay, Star,
what are you up to?

17:24.811 --> 17:26.677
Exactly what you said.

17:28.247 --> 17:29.647
I booby-trapped
the battlefield.

17:29.649 --> 17:30.882
What?

17:35.788 --> 17:39.690
Star, the Warriors weren't
actually going to kill our team,

17:39.692 --> 17:41.793
they were just gonna
beat them in football,

17:41.795 --> 17:43.761
which is a game!

17:45.264 --> 17:46.631
Oh...

18:11.323 --> 18:13.891
Oh, no.
Everything's going
according to plan.

18:29.708 --> 18:32.376
Let me guess,
the kitty cat offense?

18:35.647 --> 18:36.781
We have to do something!

18:51.797 --> 18:54.365
All right.
Dude, you're awesome!

18:54.367 --> 18:56.367
Thanks, bro.

18:56.369 --> 18:57.702
( screaming )

19:00.305 --> 19:01.405
Marco!

19:01.407 --> 19:02.907
No, no, no. No!

19:07.312 --> 19:08.646
Mending Heart Hurricane!

19:16.755 --> 19:19.390
Out of my way.
I'm too pretty to die.

19:27.699 --> 19:29.367
Mending Heart Hurricane!

19:44.449 --> 19:47.451
Nuclear Heart
Healing Hurricane!

19:53.692 --> 19:56.360
Come on, fellas,
can't we discuss this
man to possum?

20:01.266 --> 20:03.367
Hey, Marco, you were right,

20:03.369 --> 20:05.303
they were trying to kidnap me!

20:05.305 --> 20:07.805
Ferguson,
get off the field!
What?

20:07.807 --> 20:09.874
I can't hear you through
all the explosions.

20:11.443 --> 20:13.344
Ferguson!

20:13.346 --> 20:14.412
No, buddy!

20:14.414 --> 20:15.780
I'm sorry.

20:15.782 --> 20:17.281
I failed you.

20:17.283 --> 20:18.783
Look at me.

20:18.785 --> 20:21.252
Dude!
I was just playing possum!

20:21.254 --> 20:22.286
Huh?

20:22.288 --> 20:23.721
It's what we do!

20:23.723 --> 20:26.424
You're alive!

20:26.426 --> 20:29.760
This is why you only
have two friends.

20:43.408 --> 20:45.743
I really messed up.

20:45.745 --> 20:48.279
You mean,
we really messed up.

20:48.281 --> 20:50.348
I should have been
watching out for you.

20:51.350 --> 20:53.384
Let's get out of here!

20:57.522 --> 21:00.424
Hey, they just forfeited.

21:00.426 --> 21:01.559
We win!

21:01.561 --> 21:03.861
TOGETHER: Yeah!

21:11.803 --> 21:13.804
Why do I have
this weird feeling

21:13.806 --> 21:15.439
I'm forgetting something.

21:15.441 --> 21:18.843
( screaming and cheering )

21:18.845 --> 21:20.411
That was it.
