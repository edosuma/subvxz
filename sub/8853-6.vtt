What the hell is wrong with you guys?
It's middle of July.

00:32.906 --> 00:34.859
- Are you drunk or something?
- We're just trying to spread

00:34.979 --> 00:36.522
some holiday cheer, man.

00:36.782 --> 00:38.590
Where's your half-Christmas spirit?

00:38.710 --> 00:40.980
And yeah, we're a little but drunk, dude.

00:41.100 --> 00:42.800
Deal with it.
Okay?

00:42.860 --> 00:43.900
Let's take it from the top.

01:10.960 --> 01:15.030
I think you should stop
getting pets.

01:15.100 --> 01:16.460
Look, I'm gonna have
to let you go.

01:16.530 --> 01:19.800
Someone just dropped
three turds off in my office.

01:21.570 --> 01:23.440
Alice, query.
We...

01:23.510 --> 01:25.410
- Alice, I heard
something about turds.

01:25.470 --> 01:26.470
Is there a poop in here?

01:26.540 --> 01:28.210
Is that something
Oscar handles,

01:28.280 --> 01:30.110
or is there a special
poop janitor I should call?

01:38.820 --> 01:40.190
What the hell
are you guys wearing?

01:40.260 --> 01:41.320
Here's the deal.

01:41.390 --> 01:43.820
We are your top earners
this month,

01:43.890 --> 01:47.160
and we've been here over a year
without a vacation.

01:47.230 --> 01:48.530
Yeah, which we don't even mind,

01:48.600 --> 01:52.000
'cause we love working
for such a multi-talented

01:52.070 --> 01:55.070
lady of the evening
such as yourself.

01:55.140 --> 01:57.100
But we were wondering

01:57.170 --> 01:58.670
if maybe we could get
two days off

01:58.740 --> 02:00.140
to celebrate half-Christmas.

02:00.210 --> 02:02.710
It's a bit of a tradition
in our household, so...

02:02.780 --> 02:03.940
Yeah.

02:04.010 --> 02:05.480
It started,
like, four years ago.

02:05.550 --> 02:06.780
Blake went out to get some beer

02:06.850 --> 02:08.180
and he came home
with a keg full of eggnog.

02:08.250 --> 02:10.050
We call it a keg-nog.

02:10.120 --> 02:11.890
We call it a keg-nog.

02:11.950 --> 02:15.490
Yeah, but we just drank
that thick nectar of the gods.

02:15.560 --> 02:17.020
We sang, and it got wild,

02:17.090 --> 02:18.160
and Adam actually ended up

02:18.230 --> 02:20.930
fighting our neighbor's
cleaning lady.

02:21.000 --> 02:22.460
It was a good scrap.
It was a good scrap.

02:22.530 --> 02:24.500
That's how
half-Christmas was born.

02:24.570 --> 02:26.070
So...

02:26.130 --> 02:27.700
So what do you say?

02:27.770 --> 02:29.570
Alice.

02:29.640 --> 02:31.110
What?

02:31.170 --> 02:33.110
Well, she pretty much
just talk to the handed us.

02:33.180 --> 02:34.610
Yeah, I definitely agree,

02:34.680 --> 02:36.340
but I don't think that's
what they call it anymore.

02:36.410 --> 02:37.680
No, she talk to the handed us.

02:37.750 --> 02:39.050
Dude, it's a phrase.
It's a topical phrase.

02:39.110 --> 02:40.480
People say it.

02:40.550 --> 02:42.250
Guys, we can't let
that grinch's negativity

02:42.320 --> 02:44.150
split us apart
just 'cause we're stuck here.

02:44.220 --> 02:46.990
You want to know why?

02:47.060 --> 02:48.690
'Cause the spirit
of half-Christmas

02:48.760 --> 02:51.490
lives on in all of us.

02:51.560 --> 02:53.230
Just like a little baby alien.

02:53.300 --> 02:54.560
Aah.

02:54.630 --> 02:57.000
Let's...let's just
get some party supplies

02:57.070 --> 02:58.270
and do it up in the office.

02:58.330 --> 03:00.070
Sure.
It worked for fake easter.

03:00.140 --> 03:01.370
- Yes, it did.
- Yeah.

03:01.440 --> 03:02.600
Although if I wake up

03:02.670 --> 03:04.240
and my balls
are died purple this time,

03:04.310 --> 03:05.570
I will get Norwegian on you.

03:07.710 --> 03:09.340
- Whoa.
- Scary.

03:09.410 --> 03:10.240
It means
"I'm gonna eat."

03:10.310 --> 03:11.650
Cool.

03:11.710 --> 03:13.010
Well, what do you say
we go get some decorations

03:13.080 --> 03:15.020
and turn this little office

03:15.080 --> 03:17.320
into a magical, half-Christmas
winter wonderland?

03:17.390 --> 03:19.950
Ooh, let's
talk to the handed this office.

03:20.020 --> 03:21.790
I'm serious.
I don't think anyone says that.

03:21.860 --> 03:25.460
- No, they say it.
- Who?

03:25.530 --> 03:28.530
Wrapping paper.
Popcorn and string.

03:28.600 --> 03:29.960
Got it. Got it.

03:30.030 --> 03:30.930
Wrapping paper.

03:31.000 --> 03:32.330
I just said I got it.

03:32.400 --> 03:33.900
I know, I'm just
checking it twice, homie,

03:33.970 --> 03:35.900
'cause I plan on being naughty.

03:35.970 --> 03:36.940
Hell no! We won't go!

03:37.010 --> 03:38.240
Wow, what do we got here?

03:38.310 --> 03:39.740
We're on strike for more pay,

03:39.810 --> 03:40.740
better hours, insurance.

03:40.810 --> 03:41.910
What?

03:41.980 --> 03:43.010
Let me get this straight,

03:43.080 --> 03:44.280
all you guys do
is stand out here,

03:44.350 --> 03:45.510
yell at people,
while not working?

03:45.580 --> 03:47.410
Do I smell barbecue?

03:47.480 --> 03:49.320
Because I am not mad at that.

03:49.380 --> 03:50.550
Can we go?

03:50.620 --> 03:52.050
Unlike these freeloaders,
no offense,

03:52.120 --> 03:53.090
we got a job to get back to.

03:53.150 --> 03:55.660
Whoa, look at this guy, huh?

03:55.720 --> 03:58.160
Old Saint dick.

03:58.230 --> 03:59.960
It's a pun.

04:00.030 --> 04:01.100
I'm good at those.

04:01.160 --> 04:02.630
Look, my dad
had a plastics factory.

04:02.700 --> 04:04.160
When they went on strike,
my family went on hard times.

04:04.230 --> 04:05.470
Yep, here we go.

04:05.530 --> 04:07.200
We had to leave
the country club in '95.

04:07.270 --> 04:08.770
I went from Clay court
to ghetto court.

04:08.840 --> 04:09.840
Ha. Ghetto court.

04:09.910 --> 04:11.210
I'd definitely watch that show.

04:11.270 --> 04:13.710
Quiet in the court!
You goin' to prison!

04:13.780 --> 04:15.280
Get out of my court.

04:15.340 --> 04:16.540
Cut it out.

04:16.610 --> 04:17.980
I don't have time
for this chicanery.

04:18.050 --> 04:19.480
Careful, ders.
They prefer "hispanic."

04:19.550 --> 04:21.180
Don't be racist, man.

04:21.250 --> 04:23.120
Dude, you got to join a
book club or read or something.

04:23.180 --> 04:24.490
Oh, I've got to join
a book club?

04:24.550 --> 04:25.990
- Please do.
- I just finished <i>goosebumps.</i>

04:26.050 --> 04:28.090
R.L. Stine. I basically
read the whole series.

04:28.160 --> 04:29.890
And I'm pretty sure
it ends with all the kids

04:29.960 --> 04:31.760
getting on a boat, sailing off,

04:31.830 --> 04:33.660
and saying,
"strikes are awesome!"

04:33.730 --> 04:35.100
Yeah!

04:35.160 --> 04:36.530
I don't know, ders.

04:36.600 --> 04:38.370
I think I'm gonna have
to side with Adam on this one.

04:38.430 --> 04:40.470
Strikes are frickin' cool!

04:42.470 --> 04:43.600
Can we just get
what we came to get

04:43.670 --> 04:44.610
and get out of here, please?

04:44.670 --> 04:45.510
- Sure.
- Thank you.

04:45.570 --> 04:46.610
Excuse me. Pardon me.

04:46.680 --> 04:48.410
Ah, make room.
Going to a store.

04:48.480 --> 04:51.180
I'm so sorry.
That was rude.

04:51.250 --> 04:52.880
Should have asked you guys.

04:52.950 --> 04:55.480
Wrapping paper?
Aisle six? Aisle seven?

04:55.550 --> 04:58.420
Where's it at?

04:58.490 --> 04:59.890
This is good, right?

04:59.960 --> 05:01.560
Peter north pole?

05:01.620 --> 05:03.160
It's like a candy cane.

05:06.390 --> 05:08.000
Hi, guys.

05:08.060 --> 05:12.330
Look, um, I know that you're
big fans of the dollar store,

05:12.400 --> 05:13.930
but you're gonna have
to take all of this down.

05:14.000 --> 05:15.500
You're distracting
the entire office.

05:15.570 --> 05:17.040
How so?

05:17.110 --> 05:20.110
Next stop...

05:20.180 --> 05:21.680
Work town.

05:24.810 --> 05:27.310
You have ten minutes
to take this dumb [Bleep] Down.

05:27.380 --> 05:29.480
Why're you being
such a scrooge mcduck?

05:29.550 --> 05:31.320
Oh, I'm being a scrooge mcduck?

05:36.060 --> 05:40.430
Because there is no such thing
as half-Christmas.

05:46.700 --> 05:48.670
Fine, Alice.
You leave us no choice.

05:48.740 --> 05:50.270
We're gonna go on strike.

05:50.340 --> 05:53.670
Nobody disses
half-Christmas!

05:53.740 --> 05:55.140
We're going on strike.

05:55.210 --> 05:57.340
You with us, ders?

05:57.410 --> 05:59.280
No, thanks.
I'm gonna keep my job.

05:59.350 --> 06:03.120
Oh, I should have
figured you to be a traitor.

06:03.180 --> 06:05.950
Bene-dick Arnold,
over here.

06:06.020 --> 06:07.450
You could have said
"Benedict Anders."

06:07.520 --> 06:08.890
That might have been funnier.

06:08.960 --> 06:09.860
Yeah, fine.
I'll do that.

06:09.920 --> 06:12.090
Bene-dick Arnold.

06:12.160 --> 06:13.830

06:13.900 --> 06:15.500
- Anyways.
- Ar...Anders.

06:15.560 --> 06:20.000
We're gonna be outside.
Should you need us.

Whoo!

06:35.680 --> 06:37.080
When's this Turkey
gonna be done, Carl?

06:37.150 --> 06:38.480
Oh, man, so far so good.

06:38.550 --> 06:40.950
Oh, yeah.
That is cold as ice.

06:41.020 --> 06:42.590
Well, it's got to cook
all the way through, man.

06:42.660 --> 06:43.820
- Yeah, okay.
- Yeah.

06:43.890 --> 06:45.090
Guess I don't know
how turkeys work.

06:45.160 --> 06:46.460
No, you obviously don't.

06:46.530 --> 06:48.290
Gonna take it to the roof
and use the sun's heat.

06:48.360 --> 06:50.230
It's probably gonna be done
in about two days or so.

06:50.300 --> 06:52.030
Oh, that's...
that works, I guess.

06:52.100 --> 06:53.400
Um, but I got burgers.

06:53.470 --> 06:55.100
Yeah, we do.

06:55.170 --> 06:56.500
Woke up the burger wolf.

06:56.570 --> 06:57.670
- Burger wolf.
- The burger wolf.

06:57.740 --> 06:59.370
Woof.

06:59.440 --> 07:00.770
Man, I'm so glad
we're not working.

07:00.840 --> 07:02.480
I'd be wearing
one of those stupid headsets

07:02.540 --> 07:05.780
instead of...
This cool, leather cowboy hat.

07:05.850 --> 07:07.880
Ooh, cowboy hat.

07:07.950 --> 07:08.880
Where'd you get that at?

07:08.950 --> 07:10.350
Trash can, bro.

07:10.420 --> 07:11.880
- Resourceful.
- Not bad.

07:13.020 --> 07:15.320
- Whoa. Hello.
- Oh, <i>mamacita.</i>

07:15.390 --> 07:16.690

Hey, guys.

07:20.690 --> 07:22.030
What are you striking for?

07:22.100 --> 07:24.760

Truly a pleasure.

Okay. Okay.

It's good to meet you.

Yeah. Yes. Yeah.

08:24.420 --> 08:25.490
- Good.
- I can handle that.

08:25.560 --> 08:28.860
But what about,
um, Adam and Blake?

08:28.930 --> 08:30.330
What about them?

08:30.400 --> 08:32.669
As far as I'm concerned,
they quit.

08:32.730 --> 08:36.070
Craigslist
casual encounters is blocked?

08:36.140 --> 08:38.440
What is this?
[Bleep] North Korea?

08:45.180 --> 08:48.450
My oldest son
is a methodist minister.

08:48.520 --> 08:52.520
Now, his son plays
on the church softball team.

08:52.590 --> 08:54.290
Jer, if we could just
plse keep it

08:54.350 --> 08:55.590
to what we were
talking about...

08:55.660 --> 08:56.820
You didn't let me finish,
Anders.

08:56.890 --> 08:58.760
It's pronounced "on-ders."

08:58.830 --> 09:00.030
I think that's what he said.

09:00.090 --> 09:01.790
- No, it wasn't.
- I did, Anders.

09:01.860 --> 09:03.600
Go ahead, Jer.
Take her home.

09:03.660 --> 09:07.570
So, uh, in this softball
league that he plays on,

09:07.630 --> 09:09.440
it's run by lutherans.

09:09.500 --> 09:10.670
Because the funny thing...

09:10.740 --> 09:12.100
Jillian. Jillian.

09:12.170 --> 09:13.570
Can you talk to me
right now about anything?

09:13.640 --> 09:14.740
What's going on with Alice?

09:14.810 --> 09:16.440
Nope. No. Busy.

09:16.510 --> 09:17.940
Okay, I'm not busy.

09:18.010 --> 09:19.680
But I hate that guy's face.

09:19.750 --> 09:22.980
And that guy smells
like Boston market.

09:23.050 --> 09:24.720
When do we get our break?

09:24.780 --> 09:26.650
I really need
to call my sponsor.

09:26.720 --> 09:28.550
This office has a lot
of triggers, Anders.

09:28.620 --> 09:30.820
It's "on-ders."
Okay?

09:30.890 --> 09:33.360
"On-ders."
It's not "An-ders."

09:33.430 --> 09:35.590
It never was. I don't know why
you guys keep saying it.

09:35.660 --> 09:36.860
It's "on-ders."

09:36.930 --> 09:38.830
I have an "on"
at the beginning of my name.

09:38.900 --> 09:41.370
I have a hard "on."

09:41.430 --> 09:43.270
Is it supposed to be chunky?

09:43.340 --> 09:44.470
I don't know.

09:44.540 --> 09:45.640
Wish we had a shot
to drop in here.

09:45.710 --> 09:47.370
Call it an egg Nagasaki bomb.

09:47.440 --> 09:49.170
- Ugh.
- That'd be good.

09:49.240 --> 09:51.040
I'd do it.
I'd do it.

09:51.110 --> 09:53.110
News copters covering
the strike, probably, dude.

09:53.180 --> 09:54.280
Yeah.
Or Iraq attacking.

09:54.350 --> 09:56.020
- Yeah.
- Ooh.

09:56.080 --> 09:59.020
Dudes, got some bad news.

09:59.090 --> 10:00.420
Didn't tell you
the bad news yet.

10:00.490 --> 10:02.690
It's my new strike thing.
It's pretty good.

10:02.760 --> 10:04.460
Go again.
You've been replaced.

10:04.520 --> 10:05.760
Yeah, there's two
massive choads

10:05.830 --> 10:07.530
sitting in your seats upstairs.

10:07.590 --> 10:08.960
I suggest you just go inside,

10:09.030 --> 10:10.200
tell Alice you're sorry,

10:10.260 --> 10:11.230
and beg for your job back.

10:11.300 --> 10:12.560
Alice can't replace us.

10:12.630 --> 10:15.100
Does she know
we're irreplaceable?

10:15.170 --> 10:17.770
No, you've been replaced.
It's already happened.

10:17.840 --> 10:20.810
You're getting
your final paychecks on Friday.

10:20.870 --> 10:22.540
Oh, that one was kind of real.

10:22.610 --> 10:24.910
Hey, ders,
the Turkey's almost done, man.

10:24.980 --> 10:26.050
Carl.

10:26.110 --> 10:27.310
Hell, no!
We won't go!

10:27.380 --> 10:28.750
Hey, bag dude.

10:28.820 --> 10:30.750
Just wanted to shank you
from the bottom of our hearts,

10:30.820 --> 10:31.750
'cause we lost our jobs.

10:31.820 --> 10:33.150
The advice you gave us,

10:33.220 --> 10:35.690
it was, um, well,
it was pretty loose butthole.

10:35.760 --> 10:37.020
It was the loosest butthole.

10:37.090 --> 10:38.060
It was so loose.

10:38.120 --> 10:39.490
Yeah. I got this.

10:39.560 --> 10:42.130
Listen, this whole situation
we're in right now,

10:42.200 --> 10:44.500
we want to get it
back to that...

10:44.560 --> 10:46.070
Tight butthole area.
Mm-hmm.

10:46.130 --> 10:47.200
You get it?

10:47.270 --> 10:48.530
Well, you want to go on strike,

10:48.600 --> 10:49.870
what does your local
union boss say?

10:49.940 --> 10:51.340
- Huh?
- What?

10:51.400 --> 10:53.110
- The who?
- Your local union boss.

10:53.170 --> 10:55.040
Union boss.

10:55.110 --> 10:58.410
Well, we haven't
contacted him yet.

10:58.480 --> 11:00.710
Secondly, what's a union?

11:00.780 --> 11:03.220
Yeah, it's just,
uh, me, this dude,

11:03.280 --> 11:04.680
and my friend Carl
and his rape van, so...

11:04.750 --> 11:05.920
Yeah, it's a good crew.

11:05.990 --> 11:07.190
- Yeah, tight crew.
- Real tight crew.

11:07.250 --> 11:08.690
- We're cool.
- Yeah, we're having fun.

11:08.760 --> 11:10.090
We're having fun out there.
Eggnog.

11:10.160 --> 11:11.660
- Little gang.
- Yeah, little keg-nog.

11:11.730 --> 11:12.890
Well, you want to go on strike?

11:12.960 --> 11:13.990
Get your coworkers
on your side.

11:14.060 --> 11:15.290
Then you'll get what you want.

11:15.360 --> 11:17.460
- Oh, okay.
- Oh, coworkers.

11:17.530 --> 11:19.160
Cool, coworkers.
Good plan, dude.

11:19.230 --> 11:21.170
All right, crossing the line.
Going shopping.

11:21.230 --> 11:24.300
Yeah. Does anybody want
a powerade while we're in there?

11:24.370 --> 11:26.110
Anything under $5, I got you.

11:26.170 --> 11:27.170
- Huh?
- No?

11:27.240 --> 11:29.940
Croissant?
From the bakery?

11:30.010 --> 11:31.240
What's up, Jillian?

11:31.310 --> 11:32.580
Oh, hey.
Nothing.

11:32.650 --> 11:34.550
J-bell, do you feel
that you're satisfied

11:34.610 --> 11:36.280
with everything here
at telemericorp?

11:36.350 --> 11:38.680
All I'm saying is we need
some new leads, man.

11:38.750 --> 11:42.150
You know, I got a 25-foot
pontoon boat I got to pay off.

11:42.220 --> 11:44.990
You know...
♪ we be smackin' bass ♪

11:45.060 --> 11:46.130
Hey, well,
then it's official, right?

11:46.190 --> 11:47.690
You're striking with us, huh?

11:47.760 --> 11:50.160
I want $500,000.

11:50.230 --> 11:52.700
I don't know. Stock options?
Is that a thing?

11:52.770 --> 11:54.400
There's no way of knowing,

11:54.470 --> 11:56.740
but if it is, we'll put some up
around the office.

11:56.800 --> 11:58.170
I want to go to the zoo.

11:58.240 --> 11:59.440
More ashtrays?

11:59.510 --> 12:00.410
We can do that.

12:00.470 --> 12:02.510
Great. Great.

12:03.710 --> 12:05.910
My dog died.

12:05.980 --> 12:07.710
Bring my dog back.

12:07.780 --> 12:09.580
I can't promise anything,

12:09.650 --> 12:11.180
but, yes, I guarantee it.

12:11.250 --> 12:13.250
Appreciate it.

12:19.560 --> 12:21.390
And that's my
granddaughter Margaret.

12:21.460 --> 12:23.590
She's a champion archer.

12:23.660 --> 12:25.900
Also she makes soup.

12:25.960 --> 12:28.300
Wow,
that's a riveting story, Jer.

12:28.370 --> 12:31.240
She makes all kinds of soup.

12:31.300 --> 12:33.810
Chicken noodle.
Uh, beef noodle.

12:33.870 --> 12:35.710
Pig's feet soup.

12:35.770 --> 12:38.240
She m...fish.
Fish soup.

12:38.310 --> 12:41.610
She has won prizes
with her soup.

12:41.680 --> 12:44.350
Is that your family?

12:44.420 --> 12:45.350
You could say that.

12:45.420 --> 12:48.450
Your wife is beautiful.

12:48.520 --> 12:49.490
Yeah.

12:49.560 --> 12:50.460
Holmvic.

12:50.520 --> 12:51.490
Yes.

12:51.560 --> 12:52.990
It's time to step it up.

12:53.060 --> 12:54.730
I need you mobile.

12:54.790 --> 12:58.300
Whoa.
Bluetooth jawbone thinker?

12:58.360 --> 13:00.130
With noise-assassin
technology?

13:00.200 --> 13:01.130
Yeah, that's right.

13:01.200 --> 13:02.130
Good deal.

13:02.200 --> 13:03.270
Just wanted to thank you

13:03.340 --> 13:05.240
for still being
a part of the team.

13:05.300 --> 13:08.370
You know, I think you're
a regular Derek jeter,

13:08.440 --> 13:10.880
or some sports [Bleep].

13:17.020 --> 13:20.380
You know, guys,
some say that luck

13:20.450 --> 13:22.850
is preparation
meeting opportunity.

13:22.920 --> 13:28.130
I say luck is for nerds
without bluetooths.

13:28.190 --> 13:30.030
Ah ha.

13:30.100 --> 13:32.130
We're not gonna
take it anymore, guys!

13:32.200 --> 13:34.400
We need to tell corporate
to suck it!

13:34.470 --> 13:36.570
Suck it!

13:36.640 --> 13:39.040
Oh, sorry. I thought everybody
was gonna do that.

13:39.100 --> 13:40.510
No, we totally should.

13:40.570 --> 13:41.940
Suck our dicks!

13:42.010 --> 13:44.280
Yeah!

14:02.560 --> 14:04.930
Hell no, we won't go...

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
Back outside.

14:07.070 --> 14:09.400
Hell no! We won't go!

14:09.470 --> 14:11.670
Back outside!
Hell no!

Get down! You get...!

14:13.440 --> 14:14.470
Get down!

14:14.540 --> 14:15.840
Hell no!
We won't go!

14:15.910 --> 14:17.340
I'm a martyr!
I am a martyr!

14:17.410 --> 14:19.440
Move!
You're going outside!

14:19.510 --> 14:21.210

Uh, yes, she is,
but can you please hold?

14:28.820 --> 14:29.820
Great. Thank you.

14:29.890 --> 14:31.690
Hi, Alice Murphy's office.

14:31.760 --> 14:33.020
No, she's not.
Can you please hold?

14:33.090 --> 14:34.930
Thank you.

14:34.990 --> 14:37.430
Hi.
Alice Murphy's office.

14:37.500 --> 14:38.730
Yes, Mr. Benson.

14:38.800 --> 14:41.070
Just a moment.
Please hold.

14:41.130 --> 14:44.870
Hey, Alice, it's Mr. Benson
on line one from corporate.

14:44.940 --> 14:46.470
Oh, wonderful.

14:46.540 --> 14:49.970
Hey, uh, buddy, why don't
you stay on the line

14:50.040 --> 14:51.910
and then you can see
how them big dicks "swang."

14:51.980 --> 14:54.380
Okay. Swang!

14:54.450 --> 14:55.750
Just a second.
I'll put him through.

14:55.810 --> 14:56.880
All right.

14:56.950 --> 14:58.780
Yeah, you can
go ahead through. Okay.

14:58.850 --> 15:01.550
Hello.
Hi, Mr. Benson.

15:01.620 --> 15:03.590
Yes, everything is just fine.

15:03.660 --> 15:06.190
No, no, no,
it's not a real strike.

15:06.260 --> 15:11.160
Yeah, because they have no idea
what a real strike is.

15:11.230 --> 15:12.830
No, this is, um...

15:12.900 --> 15:15.900
This is not about
the do not call list.

15:15.970 --> 15:17.400
Yeah, because they
haven't even seen it.

15:17.470 --> 15:19.000
Look, half of these people

15:19.070 --> 15:20.840
haven't even graduated
high school, okay?

15:20.910 --> 15:23.570
They're barely
functioning alcoholics.

15:23.640 --> 15:25.810
Yeah, okay.
Give my best to Ruth.

15:25.880 --> 15:27.510
Okay.

15:34.650 --> 15:36.190
Hey, buddy.

15:36.250 --> 15:38.520
So, um,
just between you and me,

15:38.590 --> 15:41.630
we're gonna keep all that
do not call list stuff

15:41.690 --> 15:43.890
on the hushety hush, right?

15:43.960 --> 15:46.700
Isn't it kind of illegal
to use the do not call list

15:46.770 --> 15:48.470
to call people?

15:48.530 --> 15:50.230
Yeah.

15:50.300 --> 15:54.340
Listen, do you or do you not

15:54.410 --> 15:57.340
want to run with the big dogs?

15:57.410 --> 15:59.180
I want to run
with the big dogs.

15:59.240 --> 16:00.440
Yeah, you do.

16:00.510 --> 16:02.410
And sometimes
when you're a big dog

16:02.480 --> 16:04.680
you got to learn
how to wear a muzzle.

16:04.750 --> 16:05.850
Okay?

16:05.920 --> 16:08.050
- Mm-hmm.
- We hearing each other?

16:08.120 --> 16:09.890
Yeah. Well,
you're not hearing me,

16:09.960 --> 16:10.890
'cause I got a muzzle on.

16:10.960 --> 16:12.590
All right.

16:12.660 --> 16:13.660
That's what I like to hear.

16:13.730 --> 16:15.330
- Yeah.
- Good work.

16:15.390 --> 16:17.030
Zip it, lock it,
keep it in my pocket.

16:21.730 --> 16:24.300
Morning, scab.

16:24.370 --> 16:26.600
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

16:26.670 --> 16:30.240
I'm sorry, Anders,
but tricks are for kids.

16:30.310 --> 16:31.540
And union workers.

16:31.610 --> 16:33.140
Those aren't even tricks.

16:33.210 --> 16:34.450
No, they're the imitation kind

16:34.510 --> 16:37.010
that you brought
at traitor Joe's.

16:37.080 --> 16:38.220
What?

16:38.280 --> 16:39.850
Traitor!

16:39.920 --> 16:41.550
You know, you could
have said traitor ders.

16:41.620 --> 16:43.250
Been funnier.

16:43.320 --> 16:45.090
What now? Traitor!

16:45.160 --> 16:46.860
You are a traitor!
You're a traitor!

16:46.930 --> 16:48.990
Aah!

16:49.060 --> 16:50.160
Ow, dude.

16:50.230 --> 16:51.660
- Take a walk.
- Dude, my rotator cuff.

16:51.730 --> 16:54.030
Go back to sniffing
Alice's ass, dude.

16:54.100 --> 16:55.600
Go!
And also give us a ride.

16:55.670 --> 16:56.570
So we're coming.

16:56.640 --> 16:57.900
We're following you right now.

16:57.970 --> 17:00.200
You can go ahead
and drop us off right here.

17:00.270 --> 17:03.110
- Thank you.
- Stop.

17:03.180 --> 17:04.940
Thanks for the ride, derrs.

17:05.010 --> 17:08.109
Strike! Strike!
Strike! Strike!

17:08.180 --> 17:10.720
Turn your vehicle around, sir.

17:10.780 --> 17:14.319
Do not let this communist
bitch cross this line!

17:14.390 --> 17:16.220
Get off my hood.
I'm not a communist.

17:16.290 --> 17:17.660
Communists support unions.

17:17.720 --> 17:19.589
That's why it's called
the Soviet union.

17:19.660 --> 17:20.690
Is that true?

17:20.760 --> 17:22.990
I don't know.
Commie scab!

17:23.060 --> 17:25.000
Commie scab!

17:25.060 --> 17:26.800
Get out of my way!
Waymond, move!

17:26.869 --> 17:29.830
- Commie scab!
- Move.

17:29.900 --> 17:31.100
He's a witch!
Burn him!

17:31.170 --> 17:32.700
Get away from me.

17:32.770 --> 17:34.510
Wish it didn't have
to be like this, ders.

17:34.570 --> 17:35.640
Breaks my heart.

17:35.710 --> 17:37.640
On half-Christmas Eve,
of all days.

17:37.710 --> 17:39.680
I hope you're all
proud of yourselves.

17:39.750 --> 17:41.350
You're all filthy animals!

17:41.410 --> 17:43.750
Fire in the hole!

17:43.820 --> 17:45.620
Nice try.

17:50.360 --> 17:51.820
You know, honestly,
I would have...no!

17:51.890 --> 17:54.960
Commie scab!
Commie scab!

17:57.130 --> 17:58.360
Here. I want you
to give their friends

17:58.430 --> 17:59.860
their last paychecks.

17:59.930 --> 18:01.900
Show 'em what team
you're rooting for, big dog.

18:01.970 --> 18:03.300
Be my pleasure.

18:03.370 --> 18:05.640
Hey, you're being groomed.

18:05.700 --> 18:07.610
Your path to the top
is gonna be littered

18:07.670 --> 18:10.240
with losers like them,
"An-ders."

18:10.310 --> 18:13.380
"An-ders."

18:23.720 --> 18:26.850
Six paid personal days
off per year.

18:26.920 --> 18:28.520
Option to buy into company
health insurance?

18:28.590 --> 18:29.760
Boring.

18:29.820 --> 18:32.960
One milkshake water fountain?
Awesome.

18:33.030 --> 18:34.590
Psst.
No-bra Friday.

18:34.660 --> 18:37.230
Jillian.

18:37.300 --> 18:38.360
Yes, that's a great idea.

18:38.430 --> 18:39.830
No-bra Fridays.

18:39.900 --> 18:41.300
We're not gonna wear bras
on Fridays.

18:41.370 --> 18:42.440
Nope.

18:42.500 --> 18:45.000
And one legit
half-Christmas party

18:45.070 --> 18:47.610
to be paid for by the company.

18:47.670 --> 18:48.840
Yeah.

18:48.910 --> 18:50.610
It's kind of the reason
for the season.

18:50.680 --> 18:52.810
I'm really blown away.

18:52.880 --> 18:55.110
No, seriously, I think you guys

18:55.180 --> 18:58.420
did an amazing job
on this list.

18:58.490 --> 19:01.320
I'll tell you what
we should do.

19:01.390 --> 19:04.020
I think you should
chop off your [Bleep],

19:04.090 --> 19:08.560
and then park them
inside your buttholes.

19:08.630 --> 19:11.130
Okay, we'll use that
and then negotiate from there.

19:11.200 --> 19:12.160
- Negotiate.
- Negotiate.

19:12.230 --> 19:13.370
- Negotiate.
- Negotiations.

19:13.430 --> 19:14.870
As you can see behind me,

19:14.940 --> 19:16.870
I have a new dream team.

19:18.470 --> 19:21.170
Anders, I want you
to escort them out the building.

19:21.240 --> 19:23.540
I don't think that's
gonna be happening.

19:23.610 --> 19:26.150
Did Jamie foxx
and Gabrielle union

19:26.210 --> 19:27.450
just walk in the door?

19:27.510 --> 19:30.420
Because someone's
breaking all the rules.

19:36.820 --> 19:38.020
Where did you get this?

19:38.090 --> 19:40.830
From the tightest
butthole on the block.

19:40.890 --> 19:41.960
Anders!

19:42.030 --> 19:43.300
He's got a hard "on."

19:43.360 --> 19:44.530
Yeah, he does.

19:44.600 --> 19:46.370
And I love
milkshake water fountains.

19:46.430 --> 19:48.370
Well, this isn't
gonna matter, anyway.

19:48.440 --> 19:50.840
Well, why don't you
try to explain how you have

19:50.900 --> 19:52.410
all your employees
calling people

19:52.470 --> 19:54.640
on the do not call list,
mister?

19:54.710 --> 19:58.110
I was just following orders
to protect my job, okay?

19:58.180 --> 20:00.610
Those numbers
came directly from corporate.

20:00.680 --> 20:04.450
Well then, who's
gonna protect our jobs, Alice?

20:04.520 --> 20:07.250
Fine, I will give you
your jobs back,

20:07.320 --> 20:10.290
but you are only getting
two paid personal days a year.

20:10.360 --> 20:12.860
How do you say,
"I don't think so," in Chinese?

20:14.900 --> 20:16.230
Fine.

20:16.300 --> 20:18.360
You can have the rest of the day
for your stupid party.

20:21.940 --> 20:23.200
What about health insurance?

20:23.270 --> 20:24.700
My husband has lupus.

20:24.770 --> 20:26.740
Okay, don't ruin this
for everyone, Beverly.

20:26.810 --> 20:27.810
You've got yourself a deal.

20:29.110 --> 20:30.710
Ew. God, how have you
ever gotten laid?

20:30.780 --> 20:32.350
College was a very drunk time

20:32.410 --> 20:34.150
in three girls' lives.

20:34.210 --> 20:36.480
Ho!
Boom!

20:36.550 --> 20:38.580
Look, everyone.
It's snowing.

20:38.650 --> 20:40.650
It's a white half-Christmas.

20:40.720 --> 20:41.620
- God.
- Whoo!

20:41.690 --> 20:44.360
Beautiful.

20:44.420 --> 20:47.730
Heads up, guys.
Cleaning my grill.
