00:12.079 --> 00:15.681
ALEX: I'm heading back up
towards my tent at Deadman Lake,

00:15.749 --> 00:17.950
it's a few miles from here.

00:18.018 --> 00:20.218
I've just been
down by the river,

00:20.221 --> 00:23.022
and as I'm going up I'm, uh,

00:23.090 --> 00:27.359
I'm not hunting anything
specifically but I'm kind of,

00:27.428 --> 00:29.228
kind of hunting everything.

00:29.964 --> 00:33.432
I want to get to know this area
and all the different seasons

00:33.434 --> 00:36.301
'cause I, I've been
here in the winter,

00:36.303 --> 00:37.770
I've been here in the spring.

00:37.838 --> 00:39.371
But this is my first fall here.

00:39.373 --> 00:42.007
And fall's an important
time for, for hunting.

00:45.029 --> 00:48.113
It's when the bears are,
the bears are at their fattest.

00:49.716 --> 00:52.317
If I can get a bear before they
go into hibernation that would

00:52.319 --> 00:53.986
be a great way to start winter.

00:55.056 --> 00:57.256
A bear would be a
lot better than grouse.

00:57.324 --> 01:00.893
But, you know, naturally, I
don't know what I'm gonna find.

01:02.730 --> 01:04.329
Oh, there goes some grouse.

01:07.468 --> 01:08.600
You know, I could just
kind of have my head down and

01:08.669 --> 01:11.870
just hike right up to my
tent and not pay attention,

01:11.872 --> 01:16.408
but if I wanna subsist off
this land here I gotta build a

01:16.410 --> 01:17.543
library of knowledge.

01:18.946 --> 01:21.012
Look here and here.

01:21.015 --> 01:23.949
This it's, it's kind of melted,
it looks like a lynx track.

01:24.752 --> 01:26.952
If there's lynx around that
means there's small game around,

01:26.954 --> 01:28.220
and that's good eatin'.

01:28.489 --> 01:30.689
One more little piece
of data I'm gathering.

01:30.691 --> 01:32.624
When you live this lifestyle,

01:32.626 --> 01:34.093
you don't
necessarily go hunting,

01:34.161 --> 01:35.694
you're kind of
always hunting, you know,

01:35.762 --> 01:38.230
'cause anytime you
walk out your door there

01:38.298 --> 01:40.432
could be something right there.

01:40.434 --> 01:42.434
That's tough walking.

01:42.436 --> 01:44.203
Might be better to
go through the woods.

01:44.972 --> 01:46.771
To me that
feels normal, you know.

01:46.774 --> 01:49.341
It sure looks a lot different when
it's not covered in snow and ice.

01:50.577 --> 01:52.577
If I have to get a job and
build a career in the city,

01:52.580 --> 01:54.112
doesn't feel normal.

01:54.115 --> 01:57.516
Right in here, it
looks like a blop of snow,

01:57.584 --> 01:59.851
it's actually a
little snowshoe rabbit.

01:59.854 --> 02:02.788
Uh, right now's a great time
of year for hunting them because

02:02.856 --> 02:05.624
they've turned white, but,
you know, it's still green.

02:07.328 --> 02:10.195
Real slow and careful, I'm
gonna take off my backpack,

02:10.264 --> 02:13.198
dig inside, get
some bird shot out.

02:13.267 --> 02:16.001
If I can get my shotgun loaded
and he doesn't spook, well,

02:16.003 --> 02:17.236
then I'll have a nice dinner.

02:19.540 --> 02:21.406
Fresh meat is everything
out here, you know.

02:21.675 --> 02:22.808
That's what it's all about.

02:24.211 --> 02:25.611
Give myself two shots.

02:37.892 --> 02:39.258
(gunshot)

02:40.611 --> 02:42.828
(clicking)

02:45.566 --> 02:47.065
ALEX: Okay, he's dead.

02:48.169 --> 02:50.168
Nice.

02:50.171 --> 02:52.571
Look at that, here's
a nice, beautiful rabbit.

02:52.907 --> 02:54.573
You know, that's
a dinner, dinner and a half.

02:55.176 --> 02:57.576
He's all white fur, so he
was all ready for winter.

02:58.245 --> 03:01.179
But, uh, but this
will be his last.

03:01.182 --> 03:02.648
He'll be my dinner tonight.

03:03.651 --> 03:05.383
I respect the rabbit, but, uh,

03:05.386 --> 03:07.852
it's just the
game of life and...

03:07.855 --> 03:09.120
Okay.

03:09.123 --> 03:10.455
This could get me
through the next couple days,

03:10.524 --> 03:12.824
till I get my
next opportunity, you know?

03:17.931 --> 03:20.265
JESSI: When you hunt and fish
and live a subsistence lifestyle

03:20.267 --> 03:23.134
in Alaska you've gotta
go where the animals are.

03:23.137 --> 03:24.803
You gotta kinda be nomadic.

03:25.872 --> 03:28.873
Right now is time to hunt
and fish and get out there.

03:29.143 --> 03:30.742
And get our pantry stocked,

03:30.811 --> 03:33.011
'cause we need enough to
last through the winter.

03:34.081 --> 03:36.915
CHRIS: Look at that.
JESSI: Oh goodness.

03:39.153 --> 03:40.352
Let's get some fish.

03:42.556 --> 03:45.691
Wow, this looks amazing.

03:47.027 --> 03:49.094
The water's still open,
look at how icy it is.

03:49.096 --> 03:51.162
CHRIS: Look right here,
see that big rock?

03:51.165 --> 03:53.899
And you see how the water kinda
pulls in and makes a little eddy?

03:53.967 --> 03:55.167
JESSI: Yeah.

03:55.235 --> 03:57.236
CHRIS: I feel like we might do
some good fishing down there.

03:57.304 --> 03:59.504
I'm just worried about that ice.

03:59.506 --> 04:00.872
JESSI: Gosh.

04:03.310 --> 04:06.845
During summer and fall, fishing
at the Cosna is fantastic.

04:06.847 --> 04:07.846
The thing is...

04:07.914 --> 04:09.114
Ooh, how deep is that?

04:09.182 --> 04:10.182
CHRIS: I don't know.

04:10.250 --> 04:12.584
JESSI: The rivers are
starting to ice over.

04:12.653 --> 04:13.785
CHRIS: Okay.

04:13.854 --> 04:16.288
JESSI: All right, seems solid?
CHRIS: Yeah. That's good.

04:17.391 --> 04:19.324
JESSI: The fish aren't
in the Cosna anymore.

04:19.326 --> 04:21.059
They've come down
to bigger waters and

04:21.128 --> 04:22.828
so Chris and I have
done the same thing.

04:24.731 --> 04:27.065
CHRIS: Careful, the ice
is only two inches deep.

04:27.134 --> 04:28.834
Step on the rocks.

04:35.142 --> 04:36.408
It's not bad.

04:37.210 --> 04:39.144
JESSI: So between
me and these rapids?

04:39.212 --> 04:40.412
CHRIS: Is deep.
JESSI: Yeah.

04:40.414 --> 04:41.280
CHRIS: That's what
it looks like to me.

04:41.348 --> 04:42.414
JESSI: Okay.

04:44.018 --> 04:45.417
CHRIS: I'm gonna
head around the corner.

04:45.485 --> 04:46.685
JESSI: Let me
know what you find.

04:51.825 --> 04:55.427
All right, so I
wanna hit a deep spot that

04:55.429 --> 04:59.764
doesn't have
quite as fast of water.

04:59.767 --> 05:01.900
When it widens out like this,

05:01.968 --> 05:04.302
usually it slows down
and the fish, you know,

05:04.305 --> 05:06.738
they don't wanna be in
the current all the time.

05:08.308 --> 05:10.976
They wanna rest a little bit.

05:15.716 --> 05:17.582
CHRIS: Ooh.

05:17.651 --> 05:19.451
That is not thick.

05:19.453 --> 05:21.386
Let's see how deep it is here.

05:24.925 --> 05:26.591
It's shallow.

05:26.593 --> 05:28.993
I was hoping for a
nice deep eddy here.

05:28.996 --> 05:30.795
I was gonna bring the lines
in and just drop 'em down with

05:30.798 --> 05:33.332
a little bit of bait
and do some jiggin'.

05:33.400 --> 05:35.434
But this is not deep.

05:37.537 --> 05:39.871
JESSI: This is just
proving to be more difficult

05:39.940 --> 05:42.607
than I was hoping, but.

05:42.609 --> 05:45.410
CHRIS: How's it going?

05:45.479 --> 05:47.746
JESSI: Hey!

05:47.814 --> 05:48.813
CHRIS: Any nibbles?

05:48.816 --> 05:51.483
Any bites? Any fish?

05:51.485 --> 05:54.018
JESSI: Not yet.

05:54.021 --> 05:56.988
I keep getting
stuck up on this ice shelf.

05:58.358 --> 06:00.559
I don't think we're
gonna get anything here.

06:00.627 --> 06:02.961
Let's, uh, head up
to those lakes and

06:03.029 --> 06:04.696
maybe we'll have
better luck there.

06:04.698 --> 06:06.231
CHRIS: Yeah.
JESSI: Yeah.

06:10.103 --> 06:11.636
JOHNNY: Out here in
the arctic every day,

06:11.705 --> 06:15.374
life is a constant challenge,
and I'm super grateful that

06:15.442 --> 06:18.443
I can just step outside
my cabin door and just

06:18.512 --> 06:20.712
have an immediate
adventure waiting for me.

06:27.320 --> 06:30.655
JOHNNY: A lot of
work goes into hunting.

06:30.657 --> 06:33.592
A lot of work goes
into hauling meat around.

06:34.728 --> 06:38.263
When you bring it back to camp,
the work doesn't stop there.

06:39.600 --> 06:44.068
Living in this giant freezer
allows me to hang up meat,

06:44.071 --> 06:45.804
and keep it there all winter.

06:47.074 --> 06:48.874
These guys feel a lot
heavier when they're frozen.

06:50.611 --> 06:55.480
The cold is my friend,
but the cold can be an enemy.

06:57.217 --> 07:00.218
If you leave the meat
hanging up in the wind,

07:00.287 --> 07:03.221
it's gonna get all
dried out from this cold air,

07:03.290 --> 07:05.824
so you have to take
your time and process it.

07:07.428 --> 07:09.895
If you process
the meat properly,

07:09.963 --> 07:15.500
you're gonna have a nice supply
of meat through the winter.

07:16.703 --> 07:18.103
That's what I'm after.

07:18.839 --> 07:23.908
The fat of the, the caribou will
actually spoil if you don't get

07:23.911 --> 07:26.778
it out of the animal
and render it down.

07:26.780 --> 07:29.881
So, I like to get all
the fat off the animal.

07:31.651 --> 07:34.052
That way I have
some jars of, of fat,

07:34.054 --> 07:38.123
because if I don't eat the fat
then I can get sick just eating meat,

07:38.191 --> 07:39.691
and that fat is super vital.

07:41.995 --> 07:43.128
Little start.

07:46.466 --> 07:49.467
There's a lot of fat
in these caribou skulls.

07:49.470 --> 07:51.536
You just gotta look
in the right places.

07:57.277 --> 07:58.676
Boom.

07:58.679 --> 08:01.813
So right behind the
eye is all this fat.

08:06.553 --> 08:10.956
It's very, very delicious,
and the texture is just,

08:11.024 --> 08:15.060
it's like a, it's
almost like a dough.

08:16.230 --> 08:18.063
Get this tongue out of here.

08:20.968 --> 08:22.868
The tongue is
just loaded with fat.

08:27.240 --> 08:28.640
Here come the gray jays.

08:28.976 --> 08:30.408
(whistles)

08:31.245 --> 08:33.778
Little guy's hungry.

08:33.780 --> 08:35.313
It's funny, he
goes right for the fat.

08:36.917 --> 08:38.984
The predators out
here eat everything.

08:40.721 --> 08:43.521
So, if you utilize head-to-toe,

08:43.524 --> 08:46.190
that's how you get all the
nutrition from the animal.

08:46.793 --> 08:49.794
So, I'm gonna get the brain out,

08:49.863 --> 08:51.796
the brain is
packed with vitamins,

08:51.865 --> 08:54.199
packed with minerals,
packed with nutrients.

08:54.267 --> 08:56.268
And it's stuff I need
to keep going out here,

08:56.336 --> 08:59.471
so I'm gonna cut this skull
open and get that brain out.

09:01.741 --> 09:03.675
The texture of this is, uh,

09:03.743 --> 09:06.277
almost like
cottage cheese or something,

09:06.280 --> 09:08.947
and right now it's gonna
be a little bit more frozen,

09:09.015 --> 09:10.315
like ice cream.

09:11.284 --> 09:15.420
But you fry some
meat in some eyeball fat,

09:15.422 --> 09:16.555
you know, now we're talking.

09:17.958 --> 09:21.559
What about you, huh?
What's your favorite part?

09:21.562 --> 09:22.961
All of it.

09:23.029 --> 09:24.495
You're like me.

09:24.498 --> 09:25.697
I love it all.

09:27.567 --> 09:29.768
Another step done at meat camp.

09:31.438 --> 09:33.038
And, uh, there's
still a lot more to do.

09:35.709 --> 09:40.045
CHEVIE: You're not born
with the instincts to survive.

09:40.113 --> 09:41.980
It's not like
something you read in a book.

09:42.515 --> 09:44.516
It's something that
you learn as you're ready.

09:46.587 --> 09:49.120
CHEVIE: Everything is getting
ready for winter, including us.

09:49.122 --> 09:50.388
SONTA: Yeah.

09:50.390 --> 09:51.923
It's not super frozen yet,

09:51.992 --> 09:53.324
but we only have
like a matter of days.

09:53.327 --> 09:55.260
Really until it
gets super frozen.

09:55.328 --> 09:57.195
CHEVIE: Yep, it's crazy
how you can watch the water

09:57.263 --> 09:59.197
like kinda get heavy.

09:59.265 --> 10:02.200
Sonta and I and the baby are
gonna head out to our cabin.

10:02.202 --> 10:04.269
The goal is to start
building a steam bath.

10:05.338 --> 10:07.472
SONTA: I'm super excited about
just the ability to spend more

10:07.474 --> 10:11.142
time out here, having a steam bath
will really allow us to stay clean...

10:11.144 --> 10:12.076
CHEVIE: Yep.

10:12.079 --> 10:13.278
SONTA: And that's
really the great way,

10:13.346 --> 10:15.814
sometimes cleaner than a
shower will get you, really.

10:15.882 --> 10:16.848
CHEVIE: Yep.

10:19.286 --> 10:22.687
My only obstacle, I
wanna get this done before

10:22.689 --> 10:24.055
this river freezes up.

10:27.560 --> 10:29.293
SONTA: What do
you think, Chevelle?

10:29.296 --> 10:31.696
Wanna check it out?

10:31.765 --> 10:32.964
CHEVIE: All right.

10:32.966 --> 10:36.367
Let's break some ground
on this project before

10:36.370 --> 10:38.336
it gets any colder out here.

10:39.840 --> 10:42.306
SONTA: Well the next step
of just kinda figuring out

10:42.309 --> 10:44.175
where to put the steam bath.

10:44.244 --> 10:46.578
CHEVIE: Yeah.
SONTA: Yeah.

10:46.646 --> 10:50.649
CHEVIE: It's gonna be eight
feet wide, by 16 feet long, and so

10:50.717 --> 10:53.985
we were thinking the front of
the door kinda facing the cabin.

10:54.054 --> 10:55.720
SONTA: Sure, and
that way also, you know,

10:55.722 --> 10:57.655
we talked about
having some windows there,

10:57.658 --> 11:00.725
a nice look out to the river,
or look out to the flat.

11:00.794 --> 11:02.661
(crying)

11:02.729 --> 11:04.195
Well, the baby's
starting to cry.

11:04.197 --> 11:05.797
I'm gonna go and
leave you to it.

11:05.865 --> 11:06.864
CHEVIE: All right.

11:06.867 --> 11:08.066
SONTA: But I'll
come out when I can.

11:08.134 --> 11:09.134
CHEVIE: Sounds good.

11:13.540 --> 11:16.407
I need to start getting into
the foundation stuff before

11:16.410 --> 11:18.343
the ground gets
any more frost in it.

11:19.079 --> 11:21.079
'Cause you don't
wanna take any shortcuts.

11:21.081 --> 11:25.150
It's a long process, you
just gotta, uh, do it right.

11:27.154 --> 11:30.555
All right, time to get my, uh,

11:30.557 --> 11:33.158
four-by-four beams
to run across the top,

11:33.226 --> 11:36.360
get stuff a little righter
and tighter, and, uh,

11:36.363 --> 11:37.729
start building the floor.

11:42.369 --> 11:46.304
I just need your straight
eyeball on where you want that

11:46.306 --> 11:48.590
edge of the house to be.

11:48.642 --> 11:49.774
SONTA: Well,
here's the thing, okay.

11:49.776 --> 11:52.977
So, you're, you're in the
steam bath, and whatever.

11:52.979 --> 11:55.313
You're like changing
and you're looking out and

11:55.381 --> 11:57.048
you're gonna see the outhouse.

11:57.050 --> 11:58.717
Probably. Right?

11:58.785 --> 11:59.984
CHEVIE: I don't know,
I don't think so.

12:00.053 --> 12:03.254
SONTA: If it went more this way,
you'd at least get more of that,

12:03.323 --> 12:05.389
if it's not a huge deal.

12:05.392 --> 12:06.591
CHEVIE: (bleep).

12:06.593 --> 12:08.993
SONTA: But that's really
nothing though, really.

12:08.995 --> 12:10.395
Right? Is it,
is it, does it matter?

12:10.463 --> 12:11.729
CHEVIE: Oh,
it's nothing, you know.

12:11.732 --> 12:14.999
(bleep) I'll shovel
and chop all day.

12:15.802 --> 12:17.068
Chevelle's learning how to...

12:17.070 --> 12:19.203
SONTA: She's learning how to
be the assistant on the job.

12:19.206 --> 12:20.471
CHEVIE: Start
praying for her husband.

12:20.474 --> 12:21.539
(laughs)

12:21.608 --> 12:24.342
SONTA: Yeah.
CHEVIE: All right. Love you.

12:24.410 --> 12:25.944
Back to the manual labor.

12:30.817 --> 12:31.816
ALEX: To live a
lifestyle like this,

12:31.885 --> 12:34.152
you gotta be able to,
as they say in the Army,

12:34.220 --> 12:35.687
endure the suck.

12:35.755 --> 12:37.488
Alaska's a pretty rough place.

12:37.491 --> 12:39.290
You gotta work to
get any comfort here.

12:39.292 --> 12:40.592
It doesn't come easy.

12:43.830 --> 12:46.164
ALEX: This is kinda the way
I wanted to live out here.

12:46.166 --> 12:48.032
It's kinda the way
I like it, ya know?

12:48.101 --> 12:49.901
No sense of time.

12:49.903 --> 12:51.836
No sense of distance.

12:51.838 --> 12:53.838
You know, I'm just
trying to get the meat,

12:53.907 --> 12:55.306
trying to get dinner.

12:55.308 --> 12:58.243
And when I get it, all
questions are answered,

12:58.311 --> 12:59.911
and when I don't,
I keep looking.

12:59.979 --> 13:01.146
(laughs)

13:02.916 --> 13:05.116
It's getting colder now
that the day's about to end.

13:05.185 --> 13:07.385
So, I'm looking to
make a fire, warm up,

13:07.453 --> 13:09.988
and then dress this
rabbit up, cook him,

13:10.056 --> 13:11.456
have a good night.

13:15.261 --> 13:17.562
So, this is my camp
just up ahead here.

13:18.799 --> 13:21.466
I've got a, uh,
canvas wall tent.

13:21.534 --> 13:24.068
Same style, you know,
gold-miners and stuff used to bring,

13:24.137 --> 13:26.537
just big enough so you
have some quality of life but

13:26.540 --> 13:28.973
also small enough
you can keep it warm.

13:31.678 --> 13:33.044
Uh-oh.

13:35.014 --> 13:37.415
I can see the
backside of the tent,

13:37.417 --> 13:39.484
and I see a door.

13:39.552 --> 13:41.202
There's no door on the
back side of the tent.

13:47.427 --> 13:50.261
♪ ♪

13:56.452 --> 14:01.389
♪ ♪

14:01.391 --> 14:02.757
ALEX: Someone's been in here.

14:04.394 --> 14:05.927
It's a lot
messier than I left it.

14:06.730 --> 14:08.263
Let's take a look inside.

14:09.332 --> 14:10.732
That's gotta be a bear.

14:13.670 --> 14:15.403
Damn, he trashed it.

14:15.405 --> 14:18.406
He just basically shoved his
head and just busted these buckles.

14:20.210 --> 14:23.945
Uh, so I gotta get this place cleaned
up before I go to sleep, and, uh,

14:24.013 --> 14:26.748
and then I'll focus on
fixing this thing so it's ready

14:26.816 --> 14:30.218
for winter and then also, uh,
do something to protect myself

14:30.286 --> 14:32.286
'cause I don't
wanna be in here when

14:32.289 --> 14:34.189
a bear shoves his face
in at night, ya know?

14:36.025 --> 14:37.491
I didn't leave any food in here.

14:37.494 --> 14:39.160
Otherwise, it
would've been a lot worse.

14:39.629 --> 14:42.363
But yeah, I got my
work cut out for me.

14:44.568 --> 14:46.334
Yeah, this bear
kinda ruined my evening.

14:48.705 --> 14:51.773
JOHNNY: I think that
it's in our DNA to know,

14:51.841 --> 14:54.976
how to survive and
thrive in this environment.

14:55.044 --> 14:57.845
And I think that we
all know how to do it.

14:57.847 --> 15:00.415
We just all haven't been
given an opportunity to try it.

15:05.722 --> 15:07.522
JOHNNY: The first
season I was up here,

15:07.590 --> 15:09.958
the flies were just
laying eggs all over the meat.

15:11.327 --> 15:13.795
That's when I learned
if you smoke the meat,

15:13.863 --> 15:16.731
it creates a
film on the outside.

15:17.200 --> 15:19.667
Like a natural, plastic, wrap.

15:19.736 --> 15:21.236
Nothing can really penetrate it.

15:24.073 --> 15:27.542
I like using tarp because I
can make this smoker air-tight

15:27.610 --> 15:31.412
without expending a bunch of energy
trying to build something out of logs.

15:31.481 --> 15:34.749
It's just so much easier to
fashion something fast, quick,

15:34.817 --> 15:36.985
and just make a bush smoker.

15:39.088 --> 15:42.757
The hardest part is trying to
keep that fire under control.

15:42.759 --> 15:45.493
Because I don't
wanna cook the meat.

15:45.561 --> 15:49.297
And I don't want the fire to
be a blaze and burn my tarp,

15:49.365 --> 15:51.966
but in order to
get a lot of smoke,

15:52.035 --> 15:54.569
you gotta start off
with a lot of coals.

15:55.438 --> 15:56.504
That's pretty sealed up.

15:56.572 --> 15:59.107
I'm gonna toss some
snow around the edges here,

15:59.175 --> 16:01.709
and just guarantee that
final seal around the outside.

16:03.847 --> 16:08.783
While that smoker's going,
I've got all this fat to render.

16:08.851 --> 16:11.219
I'm gonna take this inside
and do a little rendering.

16:14.591 --> 16:16.657
Java. Wanna eat some fat?

16:16.660 --> 16:17.692
Come on.

16:21.464 --> 16:24.065
JESSI: I feel like the weather
changes every 15 minutes.

16:24.067 --> 16:26.067
Alaskan weather is
its own kind of person.

16:26.135 --> 16:29.737
It's like a different character,
with like, bipolar disorder.

16:33.209 --> 16:37.879
(gusting winds)

16:39.949 --> 16:42.216
CHRIS: Got a lot of
really hard snow on top,

16:42.285 --> 16:44.085
which is gonna
add to the strength.

16:44.087 --> 16:45.253
JESSI: Good.

16:48.425 --> 16:49.891
All right, that looks deep.

16:49.959 --> 16:51.225
CHRIS: All right, I
didn't hit water and

16:51.294 --> 16:54.028
I got a good
three inches of lake ice,

16:54.097 --> 16:56.764
plus three inches
of hard crust on top.

16:56.833 --> 16:59.367
I'm gonna push out a
little ways and test it.

17:00.903 --> 17:03.104
JESSI: Oh, right in the face!

17:03.106 --> 17:04.839
Damn.

17:04.907 --> 17:06.440
(sighs)

17:06.443 --> 17:08.109
It's like getting sandblasted.

17:08.111 --> 17:09.577
(bleep).

17:11.647 --> 17:12.914
Holy crap.

17:14.250 --> 17:16.250
CHRIS: I got water!
And it's six inches!

17:16.252 --> 17:17.385
JESSI: Great.

17:17.453 --> 17:19.320
CHRIS: Nice and solid, I'm
gonna go towards the middle

17:19.389 --> 17:20.455
and check it out.

17:20.990 --> 17:22.590
JESSI: You want me to
go get the chainsaw or

17:22.592 --> 17:24.792
are you gonna
just do it with that?

17:24.794 --> 17:26.460
Ow.

17:26.463 --> 17:29.530
CHRIS: With this wind our
chainsaw will freeze really fast.

17:29.599 --> 17:32.433
JESSI: Oh, you're right.
I didn't think about that.

17:34.871 --> 17:36.137
CHRIS: It's gonna get wet.

17:36.139 --> 17:37.305
JESSI: Okay.

17:38.274 --> 17:39.807
CHRIS: There we go,
we're hitting water.

17:39.876 --> 17:41.943
Maybe we're gonna get lucky.

17:42.011 --> 17:43.711
JESSI: Okay.

17:44.947 --> 17:46.881
Oh, jeez.

17:46.949 --> 17:49.083
This is even worse than
it was down at the river,

17:49.085 --> 17:50.885
but the fish are probably here,

17:50.953 --> 17:52.387
so we're still
gonna give it a shot.

17:54.090 --> 17:55.223
Chris likes to dirt bike.

17:55.291 --> 17:56.891
He likes to get on machines,

17:56.893 --> 18:00.828
and he likes to go
out and see things.

18:00.830 --> 18:04.498
I like to pull things out of black
holes in the middle of the lake.

18:04.501 --> 18:06.000
(laughs)

18:09.172 --> 18:12.106
I've never gotten
a fish this way.

18:12.175 --> 18:15.176
I have fished many times
in a hole through the ice,

18:15.178 --> 18:18.012
and I have never brought one up.

18:20.450 --> 18:23.718
Oh. Oh. Uh. Uh.

18:24.320 --> 18:26.053
He's biting.

18:26.055 --> 18:28.389
Did, did he stop?

18:28.458 --> 18:29.957
CHRIS: Are you getting hit?
JESSI: Yep.

18:33.263 --> 18:35.062
I think I'm hitting on grayling,

18:35.131 --> 18:36.798
just because it's
a real soft tug.

18:36.866 --> 18:40.067
Just a little bit,
just ee, ee, eeeee,

18:40.069 --> 18:41.202
just a little bit.

18:41.204 --> 18:43.204
CHRIS: Jess, oh Jess.

18:43.272 --> 18:45.006
JESSI: Did you get, don't
you dare get a fish before me.

18:45.074 --> 18:46.741
CHRIS: Jess. Get that net.
Come on, Jess.

18:46.809 --> 18:49.143
JESSI: The net. Okay.
I was getting bites too though.

18:49.145 --> 18:50.077
I'm coming!

18:50.146 --> 18:51.012
I'm coming. I'm coming.

18:51.080 --> 18:51.879
CHRIS: Come on, Jess!
JESSI: I'm coming!

18:51.948 --> 18:52.813
CHRIS: I'm gonna
lose it, come on!

18:52.816 --> 18:54.482
JESSI: I'm coming!
I got it. I got it.

18:54.484 --> 18:55.683
Here, right here.
I'm right here.

18:55.751 --> 18:56.717
Oh my gosh.

19:01.875 --> 19:03.807
'T believe
you got a fish before I did.

19:03.810 --> 19:04.875
CHRIS: Get it. Get it.
Get it. Get it. Get it.

19:04.878 --> 19:08.012
JESSI: Ha! Fishes!

19:08.080 --> 19:11.582
CHRIS: Look at that rainbow.
What a beautiful fish.

19:12.552 --> 19:14.485
Yeah, keep it
away from that hole.

19:14.554 --> 19:16.020
All right.

19:16.022 --> 19:18.823
Thank you, fish,
even though you're small.

19:18.891 --> 19:20.024
We'll still enjoy you.

19:20.026 --> 19:23.427
JESSI: Oh, my gosh, I
can't believe that, argh!

19:23.496 --> 19:25.829
You got what one before me.

19:25.832 --> 19:28.866
I'm jealous! Woo!

19:29.636 --> 19:31.769
I have never been
in winds like this.

19:31.837 --> 19:37.108
I have very little luck being
out on ice doing ice fishing, but...

19:37.176 --> 19:39.577
CHRIS: Whoa!
JESSI: I'm willing to stay here.

19:39.579 --> 19:40.911
(laughs)

19:40.914 --> 19:44.382
JESSI: The next fish
has Jessi's name on it.

19:44.450 --> 19:45.983
CHRIS: Oh, there he is.

19:46.052 --> 19:47.985
Fish on! Fish on!

19:47.987 --> 19:49.520
Get the net! Fish on!

19:49.522 --> 19:51.189
JESSI: Okay! I'm coming!

19:51.257 --> 19:52.456
Fish are biting.

19:52.492 --> 19:53.991
I'm coming.
I'm coming. I'm coming.

19:54.060 --> 19:54.992
And I'm happy.

19:55.061 --> 19:56.327
CHRIS: Come on, Jess!

19:56.395 --> 19:59.063
JESSI: Even though this is probably
one of the rougher experiences

19:59.065 --> 20:00.264
I've ever had fishing.

20:00.333 --> 20:01.532
CHRIS: I just had it up.

20:01.534 --> 20:02.567
I'm losing him.

20:03.870 --> 20:06.270
Here he comes.
Here he comes.

20:06.339 --> 20:07.805
Hang on. Hang on.
Hang on. Hang on.

20:07.873 --> 20:09.407
And now. Now.

20:09.475 --> 20:10.541
Oh! Right!

20:10.543 --> 20:13.344
JESSI: Yay! Good job, Chris!

20:14.414 --> 20:15.613
At least we're
getting something.

20:18.017 --> 20:20.952
ALEX: If you're someone
who's keen on being comfortable,

20:21.020 --> 20:23.020
this isn't the
lifestyle for you.

20:23.022 --> 20:26.957
If you just eliminate the
possibility of quitting from your mind,

20:26.960 --> 20:28.893
then you start
finding ways to adapt.

20:34.701 --> 20:37.301
ALEX: So, this just demonstrates
the kinda brute strength of a bear.

20:37.303 --> 20:38.970
This is like
really thick, strong fabric.

20:39.038 --> 20:41.239
It's hard to cut,
even with a knife.

20:41.307 --> 20:43.173
You know you can take
a sharp knife at it and,

20:43.176 --> 20:44.976
and really have to
work to get it to cut.

20:45.044 --> 20:47.378
He just put his claws right
in there and shredded it.

20:49.515 --> 20:50.914
I view this as a warning shot.

20:50.917 --> 20:52.583
Okay.

20:52.652 --> 20:55.519
My first priority is to
get this place fortified.

20:57.456 --> 20:59.874
Because the bear
could come back tonight.

21:00.326 --> 21:02.126
I'll just clean
these branches up.

21:02.194 --> 21:05.329
I already got the
metal frame on the tent.

21:05.331 --> 21:09.933
I think I can bolster the
frame using spruce poles,

21:09.936 --> 21:13.003
make this place a little
bit more like a fortress.

21:13.406 --> 21:15.873
All righty. There we go.

21:16.942 --> 21:19.010
And less like a thin t-shirt.

21:21.281 --> 21:22.413
That's good.

21:22.481 --> 21:24.048
I'll saw 'em to
length as I need.

21:26.552 --> 21:29.620
Mostly this is what my life is:

21:29.622 --> 21:32.290
cutting down trees,
hauling 'em in a sled.

21:35.561 --> 21:37.027
First thing I'm gonna do:

21:37.030 --> 21:38.829
expose the frame,

21:38.831 --> 21:41.765
clear my junk out, get
a nice, clear workspace.

21:41.768 --> 21:46.070
And, uh, and then
I'll get to work.

21:47.840 --> 21:48.973
Three critical things:

21:49.041 --> 21:51.709
I gotta have shelter, warmth,
and I have to have food.

21:51.711 --> 21:53.977
My shelter has been threatened.

21:53.980 --> 21:56.013
So I gotta
prioritize this one task.

21:58.117 --> 22:00.784
That'll be enough space to work.

22:00.787 --> 22:03.454
I'll get these spruce
poles and put 'em in here.

22:03.456 --> 22:05.322
Tie 'em off.

22:05.325 --> 22:07.458
Put one along the
bottom to make it rigid and

22:07.460 --> 22:10.928
that will make this place a
little bit, a little bit safer.

22:10.930 --> 22:13.831
Just a little bit, but
every little bit counts.

22:16.536 --> 22:19.070
Never, never really pictured
myself making a fortress to

22:19.138 --> 22:21.639
defend from bears,
but here I am.

22:25.077 --> 22:29.413
Here's the last one, but it
won't do anything yet because

22:29.415 --> 22:31.349
the bottom is, uh, insecure.

22:32.285 --> 22:34.485
So, he can just push right in.

22:34.487 --> 22:36.554
My tent's kinda back in action,

22:36.622 --> 22:38.956
but now I still got a
few finishing touches.

22:41.094 --> 22:43.961
CHEVIE: In the winter,
everything's fogged up, frosty.

22:44.029 --> 22:45.563
Visibility is really limited.

22:45.631 --> 22:47.164
It's cold. It's rough.

22:47.233 --> 22:50.434
You've gotta be able to work through
those types of weather conditions,

22:50.503 --> 22:52.370
and come out
with a finished product.

22:53.439 --> 22:56.006
(saw humming)

22:58.778 --> 23:00.244
CHEVIE: Floor joists cut.

23:00.246 --> 23:03.714
And then I just need two,
four rim joists, and, uh,

23:03.783 --> 23:08.619
we'll put together, I, Sonta
and I will put together a floor.

23:10.523 --> 23:13.657
The goal is to, uh, start
building the steam bath.

23:13.726 --> 23:16.927
So we can use this steam bath
throughout the whole winter,

23:16.996 --> 23:19.263
but we got about a week.

23:19.265 --> 23:21.398
'Til the river
starts really flowing ice,

23:21.401 --> 23:23.734
where it's unsafe
to take a boat on it,

23:23.803 --> 23:26.237
so let's start
putting together a floor.

23:30.610 --> 23:32.276
Right now, time
is of the essence.

23:33.946 --> 23:36.547
If I don't build it now, I
really can't start building it

23:36.615 --> 23:37.982
until next year.

23:42.822 --> 23:44.955
SONTA: Cool, Chev,
this is looking awesome.

23:45.024 --> 23:46.824
CHEVIE: Well, I missed
one screw right there.

23:46.826 --> 23:48.092
SONTA: I was, just had
my eye on that actually.

23:48.160 --> 23:49.093
CHEVIE: I know.

23:49.161 --> 23:50.627
I thought I'd talk
about it before you did.

23:50.630 --> 23:52.029
SONTA: This is great.

23:52.097 --> 23:54.565
There's nothing like seeing
it up off the ground now.

23:54.567 --> 23:55.699
CHEVIE: Yep.

23:55.701 --> 23:58.569
It's good to be working
up off the ground now, finally.

23:58.637 --> 24:00.704
So, I'm assuming that you're
gonna have that little bit

24:00.706 --> 24:02.840
bigger window
over here because...

24:02.908 --> 24:04.708
SONTA: Because we have the view.

24:04.777 --> 24:05.843
CHEVIE: Not of
the outhouse either.

24:05.845 --> 24:07.644
SONTA: Not the
outhouse though, no.

24:07.647 --> 24:10.581
CHEVIE: It's all about setting
the moon, mood in the steam bath.

24:10.649 --> 24:12.316
SONTA: Mm-hmm.
Really nice, Chev.

24:12.384 --> 24:13.451
It's looking good.

24:15.454 --> 24:18.589
CHEVIE: All right, I gotta, uh,
mill up the last bit of my logs.

24:18.591 --> 24:21.258
I know I'm gonna need
'em for my six-foot walls

24:21.260 --> 24:24.194
for my, uh, steam bath.

24:24.197 --> 24:27.665
It's a long process,
but it's got to,

24:27.733 --> 24:30.000
it's got to get done and, uh,

24:30.002 --> 24:32.069
I'm the only one
that's here to do it.

24:32.538 --> 24:34.171
Get this thing warming up.

24:37.810 --> 24:39.143
Start milling logs again.

24:43.749 --> 24:46.116
I've been using this
mill for a lot of years.

24:48.888 --> 24:51.622
Motor's a little tired on her.

24:51.624 --> 24:54.358
She's, uh, sputtering and
popping a little bit more than

24:54.360 --> 24:58.896
she did ten years ago, but, uh,

24:58.898 --> 25:00.698
it's built me a beautiful house,

25:00.766 --> 25:02.499
a place for my
kids to stay warm.

25:02.502 --> 25:04.101
We've built a lot
of stuff in its time.

25:05.438 --> 25:07.538
And it's here gonna finish
building me a steam bath.

25:10.709 --> 25:11.442
(clinks)

25:11.510 --> 25:12.910
(motor stops)

25:12.978 --> 25:14.245
(bleep).

25:19.535 --> 25:21.401
♪ ♪

25:21.404 --> 25:23.137
CHEVIE: That's the first
time that's ever happened.

25:25.875 --> 25:30.010
The, uh, blade was
frozen to the wheels

25:30.079 --> 25:35.449
and so when it to, went
to turn it just popped off.

25:37.954 --> 25:39.553
If I can't cut these logs,
if something goes down

25:39.555 --> 25:45.359
with this mill there may not be
enough time to get this steam bath done.

25:46.695 --> 25:50.898
Because the ice is gonna start
moving in this river sooner than later.

25:50.966 --> 25:54.301
So, you get a new blade on it...

25:54.303 --> 25:56.036
(grunts)

25:56.038 --> 25:57.437
Get back after it.

25:57.440 --> 25:58.906
(engine turning)

25:58.908 --> 26:00.641
Come on, baby.

26:00.709 --> 26:02.175
(engine starts)

26:02.178 --> 26:03.410
Oh, yeah.

26:05.848 --> 26:07.915
See if this blade
stays on this time.

26:11.921 --> 26:14.922
All right, one down, ten to go.

26:16.592 --> 26:21.061
Got ten, 12 logs I need to get
milled up today to ensure that

26:21.130 --> 26:23.063
I've got enough logs
to build this wall.

26:25.935 --> 26:28.869
So we got one window there, then
we're gonna do another one here,

26:28.938 --> 26:30.738
stove's gonna be right here.

26:32.274 --> 26:35.809
We'll get these walls up,
with the wood stove in,

26:35.878 --> 26:38.379
put the roof on, be ready to go.

26:39.615 --> 26:42.650
But for now we're
gonna keep on moving.

26:46.088 --> 26:48.689
JOHNNY: To live this
far away from everything,

26:48.691 --> 26:51.892
that's a lot of different
occupations that I hold.

26:51.894 --> 26:54.662
It's really crucial
to survival of the wild.

27:00.569 --> 27:01.602
(smooches)

27:03.505 --> 27:04.872
JOHNNY: Got some
fat to render, girl.

27:06.108 --> 27:08.509
You get to eat all the crusties
once it's done rendering.

27:10.446 --> 27:15.316
Mission right now is to take
all this fat, render it down

27:15.384 --> 27:19.687
until it's all melted down
from a solid to a liquid.

27:21.657 --> 27:24.258
So, to sort of render
this big pot of fat,

27:24.326 --> 27:25.993
I gotta get the
stove cranking hot.

27:28.797 --> 27:33.000
I stay busy with meat camp
for days if not weeks,

27:33.068 --> 27:35.402
but that's why I'm here.

27:35.404 --> 27:38.805
You know, I can spend all my time working
and then just buy food on the shelf,

27:38.808 --> 27:41.075
and that's,
that's a way of life.

27:41.143 --> 27:45.879
But instead, I choose to spend
my time working on my own food

27:45.948 --> 27:47.314
that I find and that I harvest.

27:54.957 --> 27:56.823
So while the fat's goin',

27:56.826 --> 27:59.159
it's time to bust out
myself a little treat,

27:59.228 --> 28:04.831
a little delicacy,
and that's gonna be

28:04.834 --> 28:06.567
good old brains.

28:06.835 --> 28:08.769
(sizzling)

28:08.837 --> 28:10.837
Listen to it sizzle.

28:10.840 --> 28:15.042
Just so wild to think that this
matter right here is what gives

28:15.110 --> 28:17.244
me the intelligence
to be able to cook this.

28:17.913 --> 28:19.613
It's kind of
interesting to think about.

28:23.519 --> 28:24.952
Don't wanna think
too hard about it.

28:26.589 --> 28:27.921
It's going to be delicious.

28:28.257 --> 28:31.058
You can kinda just scramble
these up almost like eggs,

28:31.126 --> 28:33.193
that's really
what the texture is.

28:33.195 --> 28:34.595
They're good in
the morning, you know?

28:34.663 --> 28:37.798
Fry up a little bit
of meat and then, um,

28:37.800 --> 28:39.867
kinda have like a scramble.

28:39.935 --> 28:41.201
Brain scramble and meat.

28:42.671 --> 28:44.371
You can just taste all
of the nutrition in there.

28:45.207 --> 28:47.141
And they're creamy, it's, uh,

28:47.209 --> 28:48.342
nice to have these
textures out here.

28:48.410 --> 28:51.678
I don't have
creamy texture, just the meat.

28:51.747 --> 28:53.647
It's just nice for my pallet.

28:56.218 --> 28:57.484
Want some brain?

28:57.686 --> 28:59.186
Oh, yeah.

29:01.957 --> 29:04.925
This must have been a smart caribou 'cause
these are some of the better brains I've had.

29:09.098 --> 29:12.566
We got a beautiful
liquid in here right now.

29:12.568 --> 29:15.702
Game bag works
really well to strain it,

29:15.704 --> 29:17.571
leaves me with a beautiful fat.

29:21.110 --> 29:22.776
It almost looks like honey.

29:26.315 --> 29:28.181
It's three jars
of fat right here.

29:28.717 --> 29:30.183
That right there
is a good start,

29:30.186 --> 29:32.586
it's good start
going into the winter.

29:32.588 --> 29:34.254
It's not going to last me
through the whole winter,

29:34.256 --> 29:35.689
but it's a really,
really good start.

29:39.261 --> 29:43.063
JESSI: If you wanna live
a subsistence lifestyle,

29:43.132 --> 29:44.398
knowledge is power.

29:44.466 --> 29:47.134
Knowledge is money
and every day out here

29:47.136 --> 29:48.936
that I'm learning
how to fish better,

29:49.004 --> 29:50.571
that's more money in my bank.

29:51.407 --> 29:54.374
CHRIS: Whoa!

29:55.277 --> 29:56.877
Damn wind today.

29:58.080 --> 30:01.815
JESSI: All right, soon as that
fish pulls this is gonna go like

30:01.817 --> 30:04.885
that and, up goes the flag.

30:04.887 --> 30:06.353
So that's what we're gonna try.

30:06.822 --> 30:08.889
Keep our eye on this.

30:08.891 --> 30:11.091
I just need you to
get more fish than Chris.

30:11.160 --> 30:14.094
All right, I'm gonna
go take my spot back.

30:17.433 --> 30:20.367
We've been out here for a couple
days and we only got two fish.

30:20.435 --> 30:23.303
I'm kinda worried about not
having fish for the winter.

30:23.305 --> 30:25.305
CHRIS: Come on, fishy.

30:25.374 --> 30:28.508
JESSI: It's something
that my body needs.

30:28.511 --> 30:30.978
I mean one day I'd like
to know how to do it all.

30:31.046 --> 30:32.712
I mean, I'm starting small and

30:32.715 --> 30:34.381
I'm starting with a
little bit of ice fishing.

30:34.449 --> 30:38.452
It's a trial and error,
and you gotta make mistakes.

30:38.520 --> 30:41.989
The thing is, is the opportunity
is right beneath my butt.

30:42.057 --> 30:44.591
Right here, all
the stinking fish.

30:46.061 --> 30:47.928
CHRIS: We got something.

30:47.996 --> 30:49.429
It's big.

30:51.000 --> 30:52.799
I guess not, it was
just an angry fish!

30:53.802 --> 30:54.801
All right!

30:54.803 --> 30:55.936
JESSI: Look at him.

30:55.938 --> 30:57.137
Gosh darn it!

30:57.139 --> 30:58.739
CHRIS: Woo-hoo!

30:58.807 --> 31:00.374
They might be small
but they're stacking up.

31:02.878 --> 31:05.012
JESSI: I'm not a
good ice fisher.

31:05.080 --> 31:07.948
I'm just not, but, you know,
the only way to get better

31:08.016 --> 31:11.051
at ice fishing is to ice fish.

31:16.091 --> 31:17.557
Do I still have him?

31:17.560 --> 31:19.226
Oh, he let go.

31:19.294 --> 31:20.694
It was a good bite though.

31:20.696 --> 31:22.162
That means he's
still down there.

31:24.299 --> 31:26.033
CHRIS: It's a fighter, ah!

31:26.101 --> 31:28.168
All right! Jess!

31:28.237 --> 31:30.770
JESSI: Chris! Dang it!
CHRIS: Woo-hoo!

31:30.773 --> 31:32.372
JESSI: Oh!

31:32.441 --> 31:33.874
Oh, I'm so frustrated.

31:35.110 --> 31:37.177
CHRIS: Oh, that little (bleep).

31:37.179 --> 31:39.213
I bet he got my bait.

31:40.249 --> 31:43.584
JESSI: Oh, there it is!

31:43.652 --> 31:46.286
I got him! Ah, look!

31:47.856 --> 31:48.989
(laughs)

31:48.991 --> 31:52.859
I got him! I got the fish!

31:52.861 --> 31:56.663
Look at him! He's gorgeous!

31:56.665 --> 31:59.866
Almost got out of
my net, look at that!

31:59.935 --> 32:01.334
Woo!

32:01.337 --> 32:04.004
CHRIS: All right.
JESSI: Mine's down!

32:04.006 --> 32:06.406
We're getting there,
that's all that matters.

32:06.475 --> 32:08.808
Progress is progress.

32:08.811 --> 32:10.277
I'm gonna go put
this fish away and

32:10.345 --> 32:12.079
then I'm coming
right back to this hole.

32:12.147 --> 32:13.413
Yeah!

32:15.951 --> 32:16.817
All right.

32:16.885 --> 32:17.884
CHRIS: Good looking fish, love.

32:17.953 --> 32:21.989
JESSI: Oh, no!
I didn't lay it down!

32:26.295 --> 32:27.160
CHRIS: Ah, man.

32:33.352 --> 32:36.353
CHRIS: Something
knocked it down.

32:36.421 --> 32:38.155
JESSI: Was it a fish?

32:38.223 --> 32:40.223
Did the fish just
pull it right in there?

32:40.292 --> 32:43.693
CHRIS: I don't know, this
thing got kicked over and,

32:43.696 --> 32:46.096
I mean it didn't
blow it I don't think.

32:46.098 --> 32:48.482
JESSI: Oh, crap,
you can see it, Chris.

32:48.534 --> 32:49.366
CHRIS: Can you?

32:49.368 --> 32:50.701
JESSI: You can
see it right there.

32:50.769 --> 32:52.235
CHRIS: If I see it I'll get a
treble hook and I'll get it back.

32:52.237 --> 32:53.903
JESSI: Look at it...
CHRIS: I can see it!

32:53.906 --> 32:55.038
JESSI: You can see it,
you can see all of it.

32:55.107 --> 32:56.773
CHRIS: Ah, I'm gonna
get a big treble hook and

32:56.775 --> 32:58.108
I'm gonna try to fish that out.

32:58.110 --> 32:59.509
Holy (bleep)!

32:59.511 --> 33:00.844
(laughs)

33:00.912 --> 33:04.114
JESSI: Well, I
guess these did not, uh,

33:04.116 --> 33:06.583
serve their purpose but
you can see it right there.

33:06.651 --> 33:08.118
You can see the whole thing.

33:08.186 --> 33:13.457
The flag is up, I'm
glad it's bright orange.

33:13.525 --> 33:15.125
Wow.

33:15.127 --> 33:16.893
You're gonna have to
get it in that corner.

33:21.199 --> 33:25.001
CHRIS: I can't get it
over to where it's at.

33:25.004 --> 33:26.903
It's gonna take all day
to pick it out of here.

33:29.674 --> 33:31.775
Oh, come on wind.

33:32.210 --> 33:33.343
Feels heavy.

33:34.012 --> 33:35.746
Oh, oh.

33:35.814 --> 33:37.631
Whoa, Jess! I got it!

33:39.952 --> 33:42.219
JESSI: Great.
CHRIS: Ha-ha!

33:42.287 --> 33:45.488
Fixing problems for 15 years!

33:45.491 --> 33:46.956
JESSI: Amazing.

33:46.959 --> 33:50.327
Hopefully we'll get some fish
instead of fishing for our gear.

33:53.565 --> 33:54.898
ALEX: I have to
respect the bear,

33:54.966 --> 33:58.101
'cause I moved into his home.

33:58.120 --> 33:59.903
If he comes back and, uh,

33:59.905 --> 34:02.639
doesn't respect the respect
that I'm giving him, uh,

34:02.707 --> 34:03.774
then I'll shoot him and eat him.

34:07.513 --> 34:09.913
ALEX: Now I gotta sew
up the big hole I think.

34:09.981 --> 34:12.582
Get that done before I
move all my stuff in and

34:12.584 --> 34:14.551
then I'll be, uh,
kind of back to normal.

34:16.321 --> 34:18.521
Okay, um...

34:18.524 --> 34:21.191
I've never
actually sewed, you know,

34:21.193 --> 34:23.193
some of my clothes
got holes in them,

34:23.195 --> 34:26.129
but not so bad that I
ever needed to sew, so.

34:28.800 --> 34:29.733
I knew someday
I'd have to do it,

34:29.801 --> 34:32.602
but I was kinda dreaded
it 'cause, like, ugh.

34:32.604 --> 34:34.571
Sewing.

34:36.675 --> 34:39.342
I was hoping I could make it to
my death without having to do it but,

34:39.411 --> 34:43.647
unfortunately this is
not a job duct tape can do.

34:45.484 --> 34:48.151
You know, life out
here is, it's simple,

34:48.220 --> 34:50.153
but it's not easy.

34:50.155 --> 34:52.355
Simple means that
I can understand it.

34:52.424 --> 34:53.890
I'm just a regular guy and so

34:53.892 --> 34:57.260
if I'm able to do
it then it's simple.

34:58.697 --> 35:00.763
That's not bad, I
mean it's kind of a,

35:00.766 --> 35:03.166
you know, I don't know if
my mother's gonna be proud

35:03.168 --> 35:05.735
but I did it.

35:07.706 --> 35:10.507
An Alaskan winter's no joke.

35:10.509 --> 35:14.044
Every little advantage
I can get I try to take.

35:15.647 --> 35:18.381
Uh, I just got my
wool blankets here,

35:18.383 --> 35:21.718
and I just kinda stuff
'em up into the, uh, frame here.

35:21.720 --> 35:24.254
And this, just this little bit
of insulation makes it to where

35:24.322 --> 35:25.722
I can burn much
less wood in here.

35:25.790 --> 35:28.091
And, you know, just a little
fire and it stays toasty warm.

35:29.861 --> 35:32.862
I can solve my
problems on my own,

35:32.865 --> 35:34.397
but that doesn't mean a
lot of times I don't know

35:34.466 --> 35:37.134
what the best
decision to make is.

35:37.202 --> 35:38.869
In my time in the army,

35:38.937 --> 35:41.004
someone else was
making the big decisions.

35:41.273 --> 35:42.805
Okay.

35:42.808 --> 35:44.607
Out here in the
middle of the woods alone

35:44.610 --> 35:45.808
I have to make
all of the decisions.

35:45.811 --> 35:47.144
Every decision.

35:47.212 --> 35:51.148
This can be part of my bed roll.

35:53.018 --> 35:54.751
But I don't want to always
know what's gonna happen.

35:56.087 --> 36:00.123
I want for nature to
compel me to keep growing.

36:02.761 --> 36:05.828
CHEVIE: You just never know
what's going to be tossed our way,

36:05.831 --> 36:08.831
but you gotta constantly be
a step or two ahead of yourself.

36:09.234 --> 36:12.369
You can't predict everything,
but if you can predict most of

36:12.437 --> 36:14.371
the things
you're gonna be ahead.

36:19.044 --> 36:21.311
CHEVIE: North wind's blowing
like a sun of a bitch today.

36:23.915 --> 36:28.051
And, uh, when the north wind
starts blowing like this.

36:28.119 --> 36:30.487
Cold weather
comes right behind it.

36:34.125 --> 36:35.792
Got a, my wood
stove for the sauna,

36:35.811 --> 36:37.994
I got my ladder
to put my roof on.

36:38.730 --> 36:40.997
Insulation for the
floor and the ceiling,

36:41.066 --> 36:44.801
all the final to things to, uh,
insure that this steam bath

36:44.869 --> 36:48.538
throws as much
heat as possible, so.

36:49.007 --> 36:54.277
The obstacle's gonna
be trying to get this, uh,

36:54.279 --> 36:57.981
wood stove up
this bank somewhere.

36:59.351 --> 37:02.085
Need to be working on
the roof of my steam bath,

37:02.087 --> 37:07.023
not playing games with this, but
on the other hand steam bath's

37:07.092 --> 37:09.425
not much of a steam bath
without a wood stove in it.

37:09.428 --> 37:11.294
So, gotta get it there.

37:11.363 --> 37:14.564
So I'm gonna pull my boat
as far as I can up there.

37:14.566 --> 37:17.100
Can't run it too far or else
water will come in the back of

37:17.168 --> 37:18.868
the boat and you
don't want that right now.

37:20.038 --> 37:23.240
Thor sitting in here
like he's watching something.

37:23.308 --> 37:25.075
He's making me
more nervous than ever.

37:29.180 --> 37:30.713
Just don't wanna be
fishing it out of a slew or

37:30.716 --> 37:32.249
some (bleep), you know.

37:34.052 --> 37:38.121
I'm really down to the last
few days of getting this done.

37:38.189 --> 37:40.657
So I hope it just goes smoothly,

37:40.659 --> 37:42.826
I don't have time for
any setbacks right now.

37:52.004 --> 37:53.036
(thuds)

37:59.427 --> 38:02.295
: Well, that didn't
work out quite as planned.

38:08.436 --> 38:11.705
I didn't break any windows,
so we're winning.

38:11.773 --> 38:15.875
I'll get it back up there,
get it sucked up that bank.

38:18.113 --> 38:20.981
It's not a super,
super heavy stove but, uh,

38:21.049 --> 38:22.616
it's a lot of steel.

38:23.986 --> 38:26.920
There's no way I can get it
up the bank by myself without

38:26.988 --> 38:29.289
some sort of
mechanical advantage.

38:30.659 --> 38:32.626
We use these chains
that have winches a lot.

38:36.264 --> 38:40.533
I'm just gonna re-hook
it to itself like that,

38:40.602 --> 38:42.836
take it slow, start pulling it
up and see what she looks like.

38:51.546 --> 38:54.047
Chainsaw winch was
the way to do it today.

39:04.693 --> 39:07.427
SONTA: So we're getting a huge
stove and a tiny steam bath.

39:08.630 --> 39:10.096
CHEVIE: Perfect height,
right waist height to put

39:10.098 --> 39:11.497
wood in like that.

39:11.500 --> 39:13.232
It's pretty sweet.

39:13.502 --> 39:15.135
Let's get it up these stairs.

39:16.504 --> 39:17.637
SONTA: Well, that's not bad.

39:17.639 --> 39:19.839
Shoot, we could have brought
it up the bank like this.

39:19.841 --> 39:22.442
Why'd we do all
that chainsaw winching?

39:22.444 --> 39:25.378
CHEVIE: Damn, you're tough.
SONTA: I know.

39:26.248 --> 39:27.414
Been working out.

39:33.588 --> 39:34.854
Nice.

39:34.856 --> 39:36.589
So we just scoot it?

39:37.859 --> 39:39.859
Whoo, it's awesome.

39:39.861 --> 39:41.027
CHEVIE: Let's
get a roof on here.

39:43.398 --> 39:44.797
SONTA: You gotta
go a little bit up.

39:45.467 --> 39:48.935
CHEVIE: I got ice in the river,
it's 18 degrees this morning.

39:48.937 --> 39:51.671
SONTA: It's not quite
over it, just gotta eyeball it.

39:51.740 --> 39:55.208
CHEVIE: I know that winter's
coming, and with winter, snow.

39:57.079 --> 39:58.812
SONTA: Little loud for baby,
if you could just keep it down.

40:00.549 --> 40:01.614
CHEVIE: Sorry, Chevelle.

40:01.683 --> 40:02.949
(laughs)

40:04.152 --> 40:05.852
CHEVIE: It's kind of like
the fourth quarter, man.

40:07.022 --> 40:09.489
Three minutes left,
it's grind time.

40:10.291 --> 40:11.491
I want to get this done.

40:15.630 --> 40:17.630
JOHNNY: The meat's
been in here overnight.

40:19.034 --> 40:21.501
It's looking pretty good, I'm
gonna take it out into the light

40:21.569 --> 40:22.769
and get a better look.

40:23.105 --> 40:26.973
(gusting winds)

40:27.041 --> 40:28.708
And it snowed last night, too.

40:36.251 --> 40:39.052
This is exactly
what I'm looking for.

40:39.120 --> 40:43.723
It's nice and dry, it's not like
tacky wet meat on the outside.

40:43.792 --> 40:46.459
Again, I'm not
trying to cook the meat.

40:46.461 --> 40:49.462
All I'm trying to
do is put this natural

40:49.464 --> 40:53.800
kind of butcher paper
feel to the outside,

40:53.802 --> 40:58.738
and this is just one more layer of
added protection against the frost.

40:58.740 --> 41:01.207
Uh, even against the birds
if they were to pick through,

41:01.276 --> 41:03.042
they kinda hit
this hard outside.

41:05.947 --> 41:08.281
I'm gonna go hang
it up in the cache and

41:08.349 --> 41:09.649
start doing the rest of 'em.

41:10.752 --> 41:11.751
Javs?

41:11.820 --> 41:13.153
Come on, wanna help?

41:17.425 --> 41:19.492
You know, I don't
ever just put meat up,

41:19.494 --> 41:25.097
put fat up, sit back and
relax and think I'm done 'cause

41:25.100 --> 41:26.666
that's just not
how it works out here.

41:30.172 --> 41:32.238
CHRIS: Do you need to scoop
out your hole or anything?

41:32.307 --> 41:33.807
JESSI: I think it's okay.

41:36.311 --> 41:39.779
I think if I had to
choose between the winds or

41:39.848 --> 41:42.615
the wet snow I'd
choose the wind.

41:43.918 --> 41:45.051
CHRIS: Oh, something
just took my bait.

41:45.119 --> 41:46.853
I saw him down there.

41:46.921 --> 41:48.121
Come back, buddy.

41:49.524 --> 41:51.190
Ha-ha!

41:51.193 --> 41:52.058
Oh, right.

41:52.060 --> 41:54.127
JESSI: Are you?
CHRIS: Yeah.

41:54.195 --> 41:55.662
Look at that.

41:55.730 --> 41:57.129
What a pretty fish.

41:57.132 --> 41:59.532
JESSI: You know, it's
gonna get one before me.

41:59.534 --> 42:01.601
(laughs)

42:01.603 --> 42:03.937
Me versus the polar tip
up since I already lost,

42:04.005 --> 42:06.172
it's like the losers bracket.

42:07.408 --> 42:09.208
CHRIS: Got one!
JESSI: Are you kidding me?

42:09.211 --> 42:10.677
CHRIS: Oh, fish on! Fish on!

42:10.745 --> 42:12.679
Hot dog!

42:12.747 --> 42:15.481
JESSI: If Chris gets another
fish I'm stealing his spot.

42:17.018 --> 42:19.686
Living off the land is
more than just a lifestyle.

42:19.754 --> 42:22.488
I don't think my family gets it
and I don't think my friends do.

42:22.490 --> 42:24.090
CHRIS: Got a fish!
Got a fish, got it!

42:24.158 --> 42:25.625
JESSI: Oh my,
okay I'm taking it.

42:25.627 --> 42:27.060
I'm going over there.

42:27.095 --> 42:28.027
Nope.

42:28.029 --> 42:30.230
To be out here and
to get your water and

42:30.298 --> 42:32.899
to get your house together
and to get all of your food.

42:32.967 --> 42:35.501
All right, gosh darn it.

42:35.503 --> 42:39.572
When you live off the land, you
become intimate with everything

42:39.574 --> 42:43.142
that it takes to live and you
become a totally different person.

42:44.846 --> 42:48.381
ALEX: This is nice, this is the
most organized I've been out here.

42:48.383 --> 42:51.117
So I'm feeling really good
about this, uh, you know,

42:51.185 --> 42:55.121
kind of turn this place into a
little bit more of a fortress

42:55.123 --> 42:57.590
so I can sleep a
little easier at night.

42:58.326 --> 43:00.726
Celebrate all this hard work
I've done with that rabbit

43:00.729 --> 43:02.128
I got the other day.

43:03.197 --> 43:04.997
Okay.

43:05.000 --> 43:07.934
I've kind of learned a long
time ago when I was young and

43:07.936 --> 43:09.936
getting started in the Army.

43:10.004 --> 43:11.537
I kinda made a little
mantra where I'd tell myself

43:11.606 --> 43:14.006
this is just my life.

43:14.009 --> 43:17.543
I thought about like,
the guys at Valley Forge,

43:17.545 --> 43:20.012
they're in the
Revolutionary War.

43:20.015 --> 43:21.681
They like didn't have boots
and their feet were freezing,

43:21.749 --> 43:24.884
but they just kept going and
I figured they probably weren't

43:24.886 --> 43:27.086
sitting around complaining
about the lack of boots because

43:27.088 --> 43:28.888
there just wasn't boots.

43:28.890 --> 43:31.024
And so that's what
I kinda told myself.

43:31.092 --> 43:32.692
I just have to do
whatever I gotta do.

43:33.361 --> 43:34.694
JESSI: Bite it, my friend.

43:35.363 --> 43:36.763
ALEX: And then I wasn't thinking
about quitting, you know?

43:37.699 --> 43:39.432
SONTA: Let's go
see how warm it is.

43:39.434 --> 43:40.833
Test out the steam.

43:42.036 --> 43:43.436
ALEX: Then I was just
thinking about adapting.

43:45.040 --> 43:46.372
JOHNNY: Hey man,
this ain't a blanket.

43:46.441 --> 43:49.642
ALEX: My lifestyle here is
continuing to do what I was used to.

43:51.646 --> 43:53.846
JESSI: Got him.

43:53.915 --> 43:55.715
Oh, goodness sakes.

43:55.717 --> 43:58.318
ALEX: Have a rough lifestyle
where I just go from meal to meal.

43:58.386 --> 44:00.320
I don't cook a lot
but that's probably

44:00.388 --> 44:03.323
a good solid 20 grams
of protein right there.

44:03.358 --> 44:07.526
When you're alone out here, when
you gotta do all the work yourself.

44:07.529 --> 44:09.662
SONTA: That's what we wanna see.

44:09.664 --> 44:10.930
ALEX: You can't be a defeatist,

44:10.999 --> 44:13.466
you gotta always look
for the silver lining.

44:13.468 --> 44:15.268
It's never not
going to help you.

44:18.139 --> 44:20.406
Mm, that's very nice.
