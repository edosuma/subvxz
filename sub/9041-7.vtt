WEBVTT

00:06.033 --> 00:08.000
- OH, HEY, GUYS.
- HEY, DEBRA.

00:08.000 --> 00:09.267
- HEY, GLAD YOU'RE HERE.

00:09.267 --> 00:10.633
ARE EITHER ONE OF YOU
FREE TONIGHT?

00:10.633 --> 00:12.333
- DEBRA,
THIS IS A LITTLE UNCOMFORTABLE.

00:12.333 --> 00:15.867
I MEAN, RIGHT IN FRONT OF RAY?
- NO, SERIOUSLY.

00:15.867 --> 00:18.167
RAY AND I ARE GOING TO A PLAY
WITH SOME FRIENDS TONIGHT.

00:18.167 --> 00:19.200
WE HAVE AN EXTRA TICKET.

00:19.200 --> 00:22.533
- IS THERE NUDITY?

00:22.533 --> 00:24.500
- ALL RIGHT, COME ON!
GIANNI.

00:24.500 --> 00:27.133
IT'S AN EXTRA TICKET
THAT'S GONNA GO TO WASTE, HUH?

00:27.133 --> 00:28.700
IT'S JUST ME, RAY,
AND AMY.

00:28.700 --> 00:30.100
- ROBERT'S AMY?

00:30.100 --> 00:31.500
- NO, IT'S JUST AMY.

00:31.500 --> 00:33.500
SHE DROPPED THE "ROBERT"
WHEN THEY BROKE UP.

00:33.500 --> 00:35.133
ALL RIGHT, YOU KNOW WHAT?
FORGET IT.

00:35.133 --> 00:37.567
I'LL JUST GIVE THE EXTRA TICKET
TO ONE OF MY GIRLFRIENDS.

00:37.567 --> 00:40.533
- OH, NO,
THREE WOMEN AND ME AT A PLAY?

00:40.533 --> 00:42.167
GIANNI, PLEASE GO.
COME ON.

00:42.167 --> 00:43.267
I'LL BUY YOU DINNER.

00:43.267 --> 00:44.300
- ALL RIGHT, I'LL GO.

00:44.300 --> 00:45.833
- GIANNI'S GOING!

00:45.833 --> 00:47.367
- ALL RIGHT.
- GOOD, GOOD.

00:47.367 --> 00:48.933
SEE, THIS IS WHAT
A TRUE FRIEND IS FOR.

00:48.933 --> 00:50.233
YOU SAVED ME.

00:50.233 --> 00:55.333
- IF YOU GET ONE
WITH NUDITY, I'M IN!

00:59.000 --> 01:00.767
- HEY.
- HEY.

01:00.767 --> 01:03.600
- HEY, WHAT'S THE CHANCES OF YOU
WHIPPING ME UP ON OMELET?

01:03.600 --> 01:06.633
[laughing]

01:06.633 --> 01:08.733
- OH, HEY, WHAT ARE YOU DOIN'?

01:08.733 --> 01:10.633
RAY, WE DIDN'T EVEN
EAT BREAKFAST YET.

01:10.633 --> 01:11.633
- YOU WERE LAUGHING.

01:11.633 --> 01:16.200
I THOUGHT
YOU WERE IN A GOOD MOOD.

01:16.200 --> 01:17.433
- GOOD MORNING.

01:17.433 --> 01:20.067
- HEY, ROBERT.
- HEY.

01:20.067 --> 01:22.533
- SO WHAT ARE YOU DOIN'?

01:22.533 --> 01:26.100
- I'M HOPING THE PRIZE IN HERE
IS AN OMELET.

01:29.233 --> 01:31.700
- SO I HEARD YOU
WENT ON A LITTLE DOUBLE DATE

01:31.700 --> 01:33.267
WITH AMY AND GIANNI.

01:33.267 --> 01:34.567
- IT WASN'T A DATE.

01:34.567 --> 01:36.400
HOW'D YOU KNOW
ABOUT THAT, ANYWAY?

01:36.400 --> 01:37.933
- WHAT, ARE YOU FORGETTING
I'M A COP?

01:37.933 --> 01:41.967
I GOT EYES
ALL OVER THE CITY, BABY.

01:41.967 --> 01:43.233
- YEAH, ANY OF THOSE EYES

01:43.233 --> 01:47.233
WATCH YOU GET DRESSED
THIS MORNING?

01:47.233 --> 01:49.100
- THAT'S FUNNY.
THAT'S A KEEPER.

01:49.100 --> 01:50.100
VERY FUNNY.

01:50.100 --> 01:51.600
[chuckles]

01:51.600 --> 01:55.967
SO DID THEY SIT NEXT
TO EACH OTHER IN THE THEATER?

01:55.967 --> 01:57.733
- WHO? AMY AND GIANNI?

01:57.733 --> 02:00.200
YEAH, THOSE ARE THE SEATS
THAT WE HAD.

02:00.200 --> 02:01.333
- AH, THE ASSIGNED SEATS.

02:01.333 --> 02:02.367
YEAH, GOOD FOR YOU.

02:02.367 --> 02:04.200
THAT'S THE WAY TO GO.

02:09.067 --> 02:10.567
OH, MY.

02:10.567 --> 02:14.067
LOOKIN' LIKE WE'RE GONNA
GET A LITTLE RAIN TODAY.

02:14.067 --> 02:15.367
- NAH, REALLY?

02:15.367 --> 02:19.467
- YEAH, LITTLE BIT.
LITTLE BIT.

02:20.933 --> 02:21.967
SO WHAT DO THEY HAVE THERE?

02:21.967 --> 02:23.900
SEATS WITH ARMRESTS?

02:23.900 --> 02:26.333
- YEAH.

02:26.333 --> 02:27.800
- DID THEY SHARE ONE?

02:27.800 --> 02:29.400
DID THEY SHARE AN ARMREST?

02:29.400 --> 02:32.067
- ROBERT, THIS ISN'T
BOTHERING YOU, IS IT?

02:32.067 --> 02:34.433
'CAUSE IT'S BEEN QUITE A WHILE
SINCE YOU BROKE UP WITH AMY,

02:34.433 --> 02:37.200
AND YOU SEEMED SO EAGER
TO DATE OTHER PEOPLE.

02:37.200 --> 02:39.433
- [stuttering]
YEAH, YEAH. I-I-I-I-I...

02:39.433 --> 02:41.733
IT'S...

02:41.733 --> 02:45.800
I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE
THAT SHE'S NOT GETTING HURT.

02:45.800 --> 02:47.567
- GETTIN' HURT?
- YEAH.

02:47.567 --> 02:49.433
YOU KNOW WHAT GIANNI
IS LIKE, RAYMOND,

02:49.433 --> 02:51.100
WHEN IT COMES TO THE WOMEN.

02:51.100 --> 02:52.633
- WHAT?
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

02:52.633 --> 02:55.100
- OH, YOU DON'T HAVE
TO PLAY DUMB, RAYMOND.

02:55.100 --> 02:56.367
YOU'RE THE ONE
ALWAYS BEGGIN' HIM

02:56.367 --> 03:00.067
TO TELL HIS LATEST
EROTIC ESCAPADE.

03:09.267 --> 03:11.133
- WHAT ARE YOU LYIN' FOR,
LIAR?

03:11.133 --> 03:12.567
WHAT ARE YOU--

03:12.567 --> 03:18.133
DON'T DRINK OUR COFFEE
AND LIE LIKE THAT.

03:18.133 --> 03:19.800
- NICE TRY.

03:19.800 --> 03:22.200
LOOK, I KNOW YOU'RE CONCERNED
ABOUT AMY, ROBERT,

03:22.200 --> 03:23.767
BUT SHE'S AN ADULT,

03:23.767 --> 03:26.133
AND SHE'S NOT GONNA LET ANYBODY
TAKE ADVANTAGE OF HER.

03:26.133 --> 03:28.633
- YEP, YOU'RE RIGHT.

03:28.633 --> 03:29.667
YOU'RE RIGHT.

03:29.667 --> 03:31.167
SHE CAN HANDLE HERSELF.

03:31.167 --> 03:32.700
WELL, I SHOULD BE
GETTING OUT OF HERE

03:32.700 --> 03:33.800
BEFORE THAT RAIN STARTS.

03:33.800 --> 03:35.433
THAT'S REALLY
ALL I WAS WORRIED ABOUT.

03:35.433 --> 03:37.633
I MEAN, SHE IS FREE TO DATE
WHOEVER SHE WANTS,

03:37.633 --> 03:41.300
AND IF THAT'S A LADIES' MAN
LIKE GIANNI, SO BE IT.

03:41.300 --> 03:42.900
I HOPE THEY'RE HAPPY.

03:42.900 --> 03:44.600
I REALLY DO.

03:50.467 --> 03:52.367
[exhales]

04:02.600 --> 04:03.600
- [laughs]

04:03.600 --> 04:04.633
HOLY COW.

04:04.633 --> 04:06.300
I'VE NEVER SEEN HIM
LIKE THIS.

04:06.300 --> 04:08.800
- ALL RIGHT, DON'T LAUGH.
DON'T LAUGH.

04:08.800 --> 04:09.900
- WHAT?

04:09.900 --> 04:11.800
WE'RE BROTHERS.

04:11.800 --> 04:13.167
I BROKE MY PINKIE ONCE.

04:13.167 --> 04:15.700
HE LAUGHED FOR THREE DAYS.

04:16.900 --> 04:18.100
- HI, RAYMOND.

04:18.100 --> 04:19.133
- OH, HI, MA.

04:19.133 --> 04:20.667
- WHERE'S DEBRA, DEAR?

04:20.667 --> 04:22.467
- SHE'S UPSTAIRS,
BUT SHE WANTED ME TO ASK YOU

04:22.467 --> 04:27.367
IF YOU COULD MAKE ME
SOME EGGS.

04:27.367 --> 04:28.967
- SURE, SURE. SIT DOWN.

04:28.967 --> 04:30.567
- ALL RIGHT.

04:35.167 --> 04:38.333
- I JUST SAW ROBERT LEAVE.

04:38.333 --> 04:40.933
HE--HE LOOKED ANGRY
AND UPSET.

04:40.933 --> 04:42.200
IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

04:42.200 --> 04:43.467
- YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
HE'S FINE.

04:43.467 --> 04:45.067
COULD YOU MELT
SOME CHEESE IN THERE?

04:45.067 --> 04:46.667
- OF COURSE.

04:46.667 --> 04:48.500
SO WHAT'S THE MATTER
WITH ROBERT?

04:48.500 --> 04:50.500
DOES IT HAVE
TO DO WITH AMY?

04:50.500 --> 04:52.667
- YEAH.
HOW'D YOU KNOW THAT?

04:52.667 --> 04:54.767
- WELL, HE WAS OVER THE HOUSE
FOR BREAKFAST,

04:54.767 --> 04:57.900
AND I HAPPENED TO MENTION
THAT GIANNI WENT WITH AMY

04:57.900 --> 04:59.667
TO THE PLAY LAST NIGHT.

04:59.667 --> 05:01.833
- OF COURSE.
THAT'S HOW HE KNEW.

05:01.833 --> 05:04.200
"EYES ALL OVER THE CITY."

05:04.200 --> 05:05.800
- HI, MARIE.

05:05.800 --> 05:08.567
- HEY, WHY'D YOU TELL MY MOTHER
ABOUT AMY AND GIANNI?

05:08.567 --> 05:10.067
- WHAT?

05:10.067 --> 05:11.233
I DON'T KNOW.

05:11.233 --> 05:12.767
WE TOOK THE KIDS
TO THE DENTIST,

05:12.767 --> 05:13.867
AND WE WERE TALKING.

05:13.867 --> 05:14.867
IT JUST CAME UP.

05:14.867 --> 05:17.667
- OH.

05:17.667 --> 05:20.967
BUT YOU TOOK THE KIDS
TO THE DENTIST TWO DAYS AGO.

05:20.967 --> 05:22.500
- YEAH, SO WHAT?

05:22.500 --> 05:26.067
- SO WE DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT
GIANNI UNTIL YESTERDAY.

05:26.067 --> 05:28.767
- YEAH. YOU KNOW, WHATEVER.

05:28.767 --> 05:29.900
OKAY, I'M LATE.

05:29.900 --> 05:31.100
- NO, NO, NO.

05:31.100 --> 05:32.633
WAIT A MINUTE.
WAIT A MINUTE.

05:32.633 --> 05:34.300
HOW COULD YOU TELL MY MOM
TWO DAYS AGO

05:34.300 --> 05:35.800
ABOUT GIANNI AND AMY

05:35.800 --> 05:38.767
WHEN YOUR FRIEND
DIDN'T CANCEL TILL YESTERDAY?

05:38.767 --> 05:40.133
- I DON'T KNOW, RAY.
I'M LATE.

05:40.133 --> 05:41.700
WHO CARES WHEN I TOLD HER?

05:41.700 --> 05:44.567
- OH, MY GOD, THERE WAS NO
CANCELED TICKET, WAS THERE?

05:44.567 --> 05:46.667
HUH?
YOU PLANNED THIS WHOLE THING.

05:46.667 --> 05:47.700
- WHAT THING?

05:47.700 --> 05:51.133
- THIS--
THIS "GET ROBERT JEALOUS" THING.

05:51.133 --> 05:52.867
- PLEASE.

05:52.867 --> 05:54.333
WHY WOULD I DO THAT?

05:54.333 --> 05:56.667
- BECAUSE--
BECAUSE AMY'S YOUR FRIEND,

05:56.667 --> 05:58.267
AND ROBERT BROKE UP
WITH HER,

05:58.267 --> 06:00.833
AND THIS WILL MAKE HIM
RUN BACK TO HER,

06:00.833 --> 06:02.233
AND MEN ARE BAD,

06:02.233 --> 06:04.067
AND WOMEN
HAVE TO STICK TOGETHER

06:04.067 --> 06:07.600
SO ONE DAY
THEY CAN BE PRESIDENT!

06:13.900 --> 06:16.967
- LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING.

06:16.967 --> 06:18.700
THE FACT THAT ROBERT GOT JEALOUS

06:18.700 --> 06:22.133
ONLY MEANS
HE STILL HAS FEELINGS FOR HER.

06:22.133 --> 06:26.867
- YOU DID DO IT.

06:26.867 --> 06:31.333
AND THE GENIUS PART OF IT ALL
WAS LEAKING IT TO MY MOTHER.

06:31.333 --> 06:32.433
BECAUSE YOU KNEW--

06:32.433 --> 06:36.233
OH, YOU KNEW
THAT TELLING HER

06:36.233 --> 06:39.200
WAS JUST LIKE WHISPERING IT
INTO ROBERT'S EAR.

06:39.200 --> 06:41.133
UNBELIEVABLE.

06:41.133 --> 06:42.567
YOU BELIEVE THAT, MA?

06:42.567 --> 06:43.533
SHE PLAYED YOU.

06:43.533 --> 06:47.467
SHE PLAYED YOU
LIKE A FIDDLE.

06:47.467 --> 06:49.067
- MOM.

06:56.733 --> 07:00.233
MOM?

07:00.233 --> 07:01.967
- YOUR EGGS ARE READY,
RAYMOND.

07:01.967 --> 07:03.667
- OH, MY GOD!

07:03.667 --> 07:04.933
YOU'RE IN ON IT!

07:04.933 --> 07:06.967
THIS IS--IT'S SICK!

07:06.967 --> 07:08.367
WHO ELSE IS IN ON IT, HUH?

07:08.367 --> 07:10.267
AMY AND GIANNI
IN ON THE WHOLE THING, TOO?

07:10.267 --> 07:13.067
- ALL I NEEDED
WAS DEBRA.

07:13.067 --> 07:14.433
- IT WAS YOUR IDEA?

07:14.433 --> 07:16.400
- YES, IT WAS,
AND IT'S A GOOD ONE.

07:16.400 --> 07:18.100
ROBERT NEEDED THIS
TO HAPPEN TO HIM

07:18.100 --> 07:19.600
SO HE COULD REALIZE

07:19.600 --> 07:22.500
WHAT AMY MEANT TO HIM
BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.

07:22.500 --> 07:24.200
- YEAH, BUT YOU CAN'T DO THIS!

07:24.200 --> 07:26.333
YOU'RE TRYING
TO CREATE FATE!

07:26.333 --> 07:28.067
YOU CAN'T CREATE FATE.

07:28.067 --> 07:29.333
THEN IT'S NOT FATE.

07:29.333 --> 07:32.633
THEN IT'S LIKE VOODOO.

07:36.233 --> 07:39.433
THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE.

07:39.433 --> 07:43.567
THE TWO OF YOU
ARE FINALLY WORKING TOGETHER.

07:43.567 --> 07:44.800
HUH?

07:44.800 --> 07:46.267
I'M TELLING ROBERT.

07:46.267 --> 07:47.833
- HEY, WAIT A MINUTE.
LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING.

07:47.833 --> 07:49.933
YOU WANT ROBERT TO BE ALONE
FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE?

07:49.933 --> 07:51.333
- NO, NO, BUT STILL--

07:51.333 --> 07:53.133
- DON'T YOU THINK ROBERT
DESERVES TO BE HAPPY

07:53.133 --> 07:54.533
AND TO HAVE A FAMILY?

07:54.533 --> 07:57.433
- YES, BUT IT'S JUST
SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN.

07:57.433 --> 08:00.167
YOU'RE EVIL.
I'M TELLING ROBERT.

08:00.167 --> 08:02.633
- YOU HOLD IT RIGHT THERE,
RAYMOND.

08:07.333 --> 08:10.900
YEARS AGO, I GAVE BIRTH
TO TWO BEAUTIFUL BOYS.

08:10.900 --> 08:15.067
AND I WANTED NOTHING MORE
THAN TO SEE THEM GROW UP,

08:15.067 --> 08:16.100
GET MARRIED,

08:16.100 --> 08:18.367
AND GIVE ME GRANDCHILDREN.

08:18.367 --> 08:21.333
NOW, IF YOU WANT TO TAKE
THAT DREAM AWAY FROM ME,

08:21.333 --> 08:26.667
BY ALL MEANS,
YOU GO AND TELL THAT TO ROBERT.

08:26.667 --> 08:29.167
AND I'LL JUST BE BACK
ACROSS THE STREET

08:29.167 --> 08:31.167
LIVING OUT
THE REST OF MY LIFE

08:31.167 --> 08:34.900
AS BEST I CAN...

08:34.900 --> 08:38.433
WITH A HOLE IN MY HEART.

09:03.767 --> 09:07.867
- SO YOU'VE MADE ME
AN ACCOMPLICE.

09:07.867 --> 09:11.700
YOUR SOUL IS AS BLACK AS NIGHT.

09:11.700 --> 09:13.333
[knock on door]

09:13.333 --> 09:14.900
- HEY, GUYS.
- HEY, GIANNI.

09:14.900 --> 09:16.133
- HEY, HEY, LISTEN.

09:16.133 --> 09:17.533
WE'RE GOING GOLFING
TOMORROW.

09:17.533 --> 09:19.067
I'M TAKING YOU
TO MAKE UP FOR LAST NIGHT.

09:19.067 --> 09:21.067
- WE BETTER GOLF.
THAT PLAY WAS BRUTAL.

09:21.067 --> 09:22.500
LISTEN, I JUST STOPPED BY
REAL QUICK

09:22.500 --> 09:24.700
TO ASK IF YOU GUYS WANT
TO HAVE DINNER AGAIN TONIGHT

09:24.700 --> 09:25.800
WITH ME AND AMY.

09:25.800 --> 09:27.900
- WHAT?

09:27.900 --> 09:29.767
- YEAH, WE REALLY HIT IT OFF.
SHE'S GREAT.

09:29.767 --> 09:33.833
WE'RE GOING OUT AGAIN TONIGHT.
YOU GUYS WANT TO COME?

09:33.833 --> 09:36.967
- [chuckles]

09:36.967 --> 09:39.433
YEAH, YEAH.

09:39.433 --> 09:41.700
YEAH,
THAT WOULD BE NICE.

09:41.700 --> 09:43.467
YEAH.

09:43.467 --> 09:47.667
AHH,
LOOK AT WHAT YOU DID.

09:52.867 --> 09:55.267
- HELLO, RAYMOND.
- HEY.

09:55.267 --> 09:56.567
- WHERE'S DEBRA, DEAR?

09:56.567 --> 09:57.633
- UPSTAIRS.

09:57.633 --> 10:01.200
WHAT,
ARE YOU WORKING ON PLAN "B"?

10:01.200 --> 10:03.767
- DON'T BE SILLY.

10:12.233 --> 10:14.767
- SO WHAT THE HELL
HAPPENED HERE?

10:14.767 --> 10:17.167
- ROBERT FOUND OUT
AMY WENT TO A PLAY WITH GIANNI,

10:17.167 --> 10:19.167
AND HE PULLED OFF
THE DOORKNOB.

10:19.167 --> 10:22.067
- [chuckles]

10:22.067 --> 10:25.033
POOR BASTARD.

10:25.033 --> 10:27.833
HE GETS THAT FROM ME.

10:27.833 --> 10:29.500
- WHAT?
- THE JEALOUSY.

10:29.500 --> 10:32.967
YOU KNOW,
THIS KNOB IS NOTHING.

10:32.967 --> 10:35.000
I WAS ONCE SO JEALOUS
OVER YOUR MOTHER

10:35.000 --> 10:39.167
THAT I PUT MY FIST
THROUGH A DESOTO.

10:39.167 --> 10:41.300
- YOU PUNCHED A CAR?

10:41.300 --> 10:43.833
- YEAH, YOUR MOTHER AND I
WERE STILL DATING

10:43.833 --> 10:49.233
WHEN SHE STARTED TO TURN
THE SCREWS ON ME TO GET ENGAGED.

10:49.233 --> 10:50.867
BUT THERE WERE STILL
PLENTY OF FISH IN THE SEA,

10:50.867 --> 10:53.533
AND I WASN'T READY
TO HANG UP MY TACKLE BOX.

10:57.200 --> 10:58.700
THEN I HEAR
THROUGH THE GRAPEVINE

10:58.700 --> 11:03.200
SHE'S GONNA MAKE DINNER
FOR CHUCK PECORELLA.

11:05.133 --> 11:06.300
LONG STORY SHORT,

11:06.300 --> 11:07.733
I SPENT THE NIGHT
IN THE HOSPITAL

11:07.733 --> 11:11.100
TRYING TO PULL HIS HEADLIGHT
OUT OF MY KNUCKLE.

11:11.100 --> 11:13.133
- YOU GOT THAT WAY OVER MOM?

11:13.133 --> 11:15.767
- YEAH, I DON'T KNOW.

11:15.767 --> 11:20.367
WHEN YOUR MOTHER COOKS,
IT'S SOMETHING...

11:20.367 --> 11:22.800
WHAT DO YOU CALL IT?

11:22.800 --> 11:25.733
SPECIAL.

11:25.733 --> 11:29.167
I DIDN'T WANT HER DOING THAT
FOR SOME OTHER GUY.

11:29.167 --> 11:31.200
THEY STITCHED UP MY HAND.

11:31.200 --> 11:34.300
I WENT STRAIGHT TO HER HOUSE,

11:34.300 --> 11:38.533
AND FROM THEN ON,
SHE COOKS ONLY FOR ME.

11:38.533 --> 11:41.500
- WOW, I DIDN'T KNOW
THAT'S HOW IT ALL STARTED.

11:41.500 --> 11:43.300
THAT'S A NICE STORY, DAD.

11:43.300 --> 11:44.800
- YEAH,
I DON'T LIKE TO TELL IT,

11:44.800 --> 11:48.233
'CAUSE IT DOESN'T
HAVE A HAPPY ENDING.

11:54.067 --> 11:55.133
[doorbell rings]

11:55.133 --> 11:59.067
- I GOT IT.

11:59.067 --> 12:00.933
HEY, YOU TWO.
- HI.

12:00.933 --> 12:02.733
- HI.
HEY, GIANNI.

12:02.733 --> 12:04.467
RAY'S IN THE KITCHEN
WITH HIS FATHER.

12:04.467 --> 12:08.567
- OH, YEAH?
LET ME GO SAY HELLO TO MR. B.

12:08.567 --> 12:11.900
- ISN'T THAT CUTE HOW GIANNI
CALLS FRANK "MR. B"?

12:11.900 --> 12:13.700
- YEAH.

12:13.700 --> 12:16.367
SO ANYWAY...

12:16.367 --> 12:18.400
YOU KNOW, AMY, I DON'T KNOW
WHY I WAS WONDERING THIS,

12:18.400 --> 12:20.467
BUT HAVE YOU HEARD
FROM ROBERT LATELY?

12:20.467 --> 12:22.333
- ROBERT?
NO, NOT IN A WHILE.

12:22.333 --> 12:23.767
YEAH, BUT IT'S OKAY.

12:23.767 --> 12:25.733
YOU KNOW,
I NEVER KNEW THAT GIANNI AND RAY

12:25.733 --> 12:26.900
DELIVERED FUTONS TOGETHER.

12:26.900 --> 12:28.533
- OH, YEAH.

12:28.533 --> 12:30.967
THAT'S BACK WHEN THEY WERE
SWINGIN' BACHELORS.

12:30.967 --> 12:32.433
NOT MUCH HAS CHANGED
FOR GIANNI.

12:32.433 --> 12:36.100
HE'S STILL SWINGIN'.

12:36.100 --> 12:37.500
- I GOT TO TELL YOU,

12:37.500 --> 12:39.767
I CAN SEE WHY HE'S POPULAR
WITH THE GIRLS.

12:39.767 --> 12:41.500
HE'S SO CUTE.

12:41.500 --> 12:44.800
- YEAH.

12:44.800 --> 12:46.800
- OH, AMY!

12:46.800 --> 12:48.467
- OH, MARIE!

12:48.467 --> 12:50.900
- OH!

12:50.900 --> 12:52.933
- YOU LOOK GREAT!

12:52.933 --> 12:54.900
- THANK YOU.

12:54.900 --> 12:57.333
YOU'RE NOT WEARING HEELS?

12:57.333 --> 13:01.200
DO YOU MISS THAT?

13:01.200 --> 13:02.467
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

13:02.467 --> 13:05.400
- WELL,
I MEAN, GIANNI IS SO...

13:05.400 --> 13:08.700
HERE.

13:08.700 --> 13:09.800
- HEY, MRS. B.

13:09.800 --> 13:12.367
- HELLO, LITTLE GIANNI.

13:15.267 --> 13:18.100
- ALL RIGHT.
LET'S GO.

13:18.100 --> 13:19.600
ALL ABOARD THE LOVE TRAIN.

13:19.600 --> 13:21.267
- NO, WAIT, RAYMOND.

13:21.267 --> 13:23.700
I BARELY HAD A CHANCE
TO VISIT WITH AMY.

13:23.700 --> 13:25.400
- ACTUALLY,
WE HAVE AN 8:00 RESERVATION,

13:25.400 --> 13:26.800
SO WE PROBABLY SHOULD GET GOING.

13:26.800 --> 13:28.233
- YEAH, LET'S GO.

13:28.233 --> 13:30.167
- NO, CAN'T YOU WAIT
JUST TWO MINUTES MORE?

13:30.167 --> 13:31.433
- NO, MA,
WE GOT A HOT DOUBLE DATE.

13:31.433 --> 13:32.867
- YEAH,
BUT WHAT'S THE RUSH, RAY?

13:32.867 --> 13:34.167
YOUR MOM AND AMY
WERE CHATTING.

13:34.167 --> 13:35.633
- AND I'M SURE
IT WAS FASCINATING.

13:35.633 --> 13:37.667
LET'S GO.

13:53.667 --> 13:55.667
- HELLO, ROBERT.

13:55.667 --> 13:57.167
- AMY.

13:57.167 --> 13:59.633
- HEY, MAN.

14:03.433 --> 14:06.467
- [in a deep voice]
GIANNI.

14:10.067 --> 14:11.667
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

14:11.667 --> 14:13.233
- MA CALLED.
TOLD ME TO COME OVER.

14:13.233 --> 14:14.767
SAID SHE SMELLED GAS.

14:22.900 --> 14:26.200
- NO ONE ELSE SMELLS IT?

14:26.200 --> 14:28.267
- LISTEN, ROBERT,
THIS IS A LITTLE WEIRD FOR ME.

14:28.267 --> 14:29.733
- NO, NO,
NO REASON FOR YOU TO FEEL WEIRD.

14:29.733 --> 14:31.533
YOU'RE NOT THE ONE
WATCHING YOUR GIRLFRIEND

14:31.533 --> 14:33.800
GO OUT
WITH ONE OF HIS BUDDIES.

14:33.800 --> 14:34.833
- WAIT A MINUTE, ROBERT.

14:34.833 --> 14:36.467
I'M NOT YOUR GIRLFRIEND.

14:36.467 --> 14:38.233
- I NEVER THOUGHT
YOU WERE LIKE THIS, AMY.

14:38.233 --> 14:39.833
- WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

14:39.833 --> 14:44.400
- [sing-song] SOUNDS LIKE
SOMEONE STILL CARES FOR YOU.

14:44.400 --> 14:46.067
- HEY, IF YOU'RE INTERESTED,

14:46.067 --> 14:48.467
I GOT A LOT OF SINGLE BUDDIES AT
THE PRECINCT THAT I'M CLOSE TO.

14:48.467 --> 14:49.867
YOU WANT
THEIR PHONE NUMBERS, TOO?

14:49.867 --> 14:51.267
- LOOK, ROBERT, I DIDN'T KNOW--

14:51.267 --> 14:52.600
- NO, NO, NO, GIANNI.
IT'S OKAY.

14:52.600 --> 14:54.267
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO EXPLAIN ANYTHING.

14:54.267 --> 14:55.733
DEB, WE'LL MEET YOU
AT THE CAR.

14:55.733 --> 14:57.733
- MAYBE WE SHOULD JUST--
- NO, NO! IT'S OKAY.

14:57.733 --> 14:58.833
I'LL BE OUT IN A MINUTE.

14:58.833 --> 15:00.533
GO AHEAD, GIANNI, PLEASE.

15:10.367 --> 15:13.333
DID YOU WANT
TO SAY ANYTHING ELSE?

15:21.067 --> 15:22.433
NOTHING?

15:28.733 --> 15:30.500
I DIDN'T THINK SO.

15:58.667 --> 16:02.267
- WHAT DID I DO?

16:02.267 --> 16:04.600
- HEY, DON'T BE SO HARD
ON YOURSELF, ROBERT, OKAY?

16:04.600 --> 16:07.667
THE TRUTH IS,
THESE TWO OVER HERE--OOH!

16:14.767 --> 16:16.100
- BELIEVE ME, ROBERT,

16:16.100 --> 16:19.167
I KNOW EXACTLY
HOW YOU'RE FEELING.

16:19.167 --> 16:21.267
- I WAS JUST
SUCH A JERK TO AMY.

16:21.267 --> 16:23.067
- NO, YOU WEREN'T.

16:23.067 --> 16:26.133
I THINK SHE KNOWS
YOU WERE JOKING.

16:28.533 --> 16:31.167
- WHAT IS WRONG WITH ME?
WHY DID I DO THAT?

16:31.167 --> 16:32.833
- YOU LOVE HER?

16:32.833 --> 16:34.267
- HEY, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

16:34.267 --> 16:37.433
HOLD ON, YOU MANIAC, OKAY?

16:37.433 --> 16:39.967
NO GUY WANTS TO SEE HIS EX
GO OUT WITH A FRIEND.

16:39.967 --> 16:43.067
JUST 'CAUSE HE FREAKED OUT
DOESN'T MEAN HE LOVED HER.

16:43.067 --> 16:45.500
OKAY? DON'T YOU TWO THINK
YOU'VE DONE ENOUGH?

16:45.500 --> 16:48.200
ROBERT, LET ME TELL YOU
WHAT THEY DID, OKAY?

17:08.167 --> 17:11.967
- ROBBIE, I THINK THIS IS PROOF

17:11.967 --> 17:14.600
THAT YOU AND AMY
BELONG TOGETHER.

17:14.600 --> 17:17.667
NOW, I KNOW YOU WEREN'T TRYING
TO HURT HER FEELINGS.

17:17.667 --> 17:20.667
YOU JUST COULDN'T
CONTAIN YOUR PASSION.

17:23.300 --> 17:27.200
YOU MAY HAVE SAID
THE WRONG THING,

17:27.200 --> 17:29.533
BUT THERE'S A WAY
TO FIX THIS.

17:29.533 --> 17:32.633
IT'S NOT TOO LATE
FOR YOU TO GO AFTER AMY

17:32.633 --> 17:37.133
AND TELL HER
WHAT IS TRULY IN YOUR HEART.

17:37.133 --> 17:38.700
- WAIT A MINUTE!

17:45.933 --> 17:49.067
THEY SET THIS WHOLE THING UP,
ROBERT, TO GET YOU JEALOUS.

17:49.067 --> 17:51.100
THEY PUT AMY
AND GIANNI TOGETHER.

17:51.100 --> 17:52.867
IT WAS A BIG SCHEME.

17:52.867 --> 17:55.367
DON'T YOU GO BACK OUT WITH AMY
BECAUSE OF WHAT JUST HAPPENED.

17:55.367 --> 17:56.933
YOU THINK ABOUT HOW YOU FEEL

17:56.933 --> 17:58.567
AND NOT HOW THEY SAY
YOU FEEL.

17:58.567 --> 18:01.667
THEY'RE THROWIN'
THE VOODOO AT YOU!

18:01.667 --> 18:03.367
AND LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED,
HUH?

18:03.367 --> 18:04.567
PEOPLE ARE STARTING TO GET HURT.

18:04.567 --> 18:06.333
WELL, LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING,
LADIES,

18:06.333 --> 18:08.333
YOU'RE NOT GONNA STOP ME
FROM DOING WHAT'S RIGHT,

18:08.333 --> 18:11.533
BECAUSE YOU CANNOT
MANUFACTURE LOVE!

18:24.100 --> 18:26.900
- MA.

18:26.900 --> 18:28.733
MA, IS THIS TRUE?

18:28.733 --> 18:31.667
- IT WAS DEBRA'S IDEA.

18:31.667 --> 18:34.700
- IT WAS NOT!

18:34.700 --> 18:36.967
- OH, MY GOD,
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.

18:36.967 --> 18:38.600
YOU SET ME UP?

18:38.600 --> 18:41.600
- WE WERE JUST
TRYING TO HELP YOU, ROBBIE.

18:41.600 --> 18:42.500
- HELP ME?

18:42.500 --> 18:44.067
- ALL RIGHT,
WHAT DID I MISS?

18:44.067 --> 18:47.067
I THINK I BLACKED OUT
FOR A MINUTE.

18:47.067 --> 18:48.333
- YES, JUST HELP YOU,
ROBERT.

18:48.333 --> 18:49.833
WE THOUGHT
THIS WAS WHAT YOU NEEDED.

18:49.833 --> 18:52.500
- YEAH, BECAUSE THEY KNOW
WHAT EVERY GUY NEEDS.

18:52.500 --> 18:53.533
- SHUT UP, RAY!

18:53.533 --> 18:54.933
- OH,
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO TO ME?

18:54.933 --> 18:57.367
I'M NUMB FROM HERE DOWN!

19:00.500 --> 19:02.633
- HOW CAN THIS HELP OUT
ANY RELATIONSHIP?

19:02.633 --> 19:05.333
THIS IS SICK!
IT'S SICK!

19:05.333 --> 19:06.567
- I'M SORRY, ROBERT.

19:06.567 --> 19:08.133
WE DIDN'T MEAN IT
TO GO THIS FAR.

19:08.133 --> 19:10.333
- OH, REALLY?
HOW WAS IT SUPPOSED TO GO, HUH?

19:10.333 --> 19:12.433
- WELL, I'LL TELL YOU.

19:15.800 --> 19:19.233
BACK WHEN YOUR FATHER
AND I WERE SEEING EACH OTHER,

19:19.233 --> 19:21.133
HE FOUND OUT THAT I HAD A DATE

19:21.133 --> 19:24.067
WITH A MAN
CALLED CHUCK PECORELLA.

19:24.067 --> 19:27.600
AND FRANK CAME
RUNNING BACK TO ME.

19:27.600 --> 19:29.067
IT WAS SO SWEET.

19:29.067 --> 19:33.200
IT WAS THE FIRST TIME HE EVER
EXPRESSED HIS TRUE EMOTIONS.

19:33.200 --> 19:34.867
- YEAH, MA,
THOSE WERE HIS TRUE EMOTIONS

19:34.867 --> 19:35.900
'CAUSE IT WASN'T A SCHEME.

19:35.900 --> 19:36.933
IT JUST HAPPENED.

19:36.933 --> 19:40.467
- DON'T BE NAIVE, RAYMOND.

19:40.467 --> 19:42.733
- WHAT? WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

19:42.733 --> 19:46.233
- CHUCK PECORELLA WAS GAY.

19:50.767 --> 19:52.200
- WHAT?

19:52.200 --> 19:53.833
- YOUR FATHER
DIDN'T NEED TO KNOW THAT.

19:53.833 --> 19:56.500
ALL HE NEEDED TO KNOW
WAS WHAT HE WAS FEELING.

19:56.500 --> 19:58.933
- ALL RIGHT,
THE KNOB'S FIXED.

19:58.933 --> 20:02.133
BUT GO EASY ON IT,
'CAUSE IT AIN'T GIANT-PROOF.

20:05.533 --> 20:07.067
- I THINK I'M GOING TO GO HOME

20:07.067 --> 20:10.667
AND WORK MY WAY
THROUGH A CARTON OF HO HOs.

20:10.667 --> 20:12.000
- YOU KNOW WHAT, DEAR?

20:12.000 --> 20:14.400
TOMORROW MAYBE YOU AND I
CAN PICK UP AMY

20:14.400 --> 20:16.467
AND DROP BY ROBERT'S APARTMENT,

20:16.467 --> 20:19.067
AND THEN THE FOUR OF US
CAN WORK THIS WHOLE THING OUT.

20:19.067 --> 20:22.067
- YOU STAY AWAY FROM ME...

20:22.067 --> 20:24.567
WOMEN!

20:27.033 --> 20:29.200
I'M STARTING TO THINK
THAT MAYBE CHUCK PECORELLA

20:29.200 --> 20:31.267
HAS THE RIGHT IDEA.

20:35.667 --> 20:37.767
- WHAT? CHUCK PECORELLA?

20:37.767 --> 20:38.767
- NEVER MIND, FRANK.

20:38.767 --> 20:40.033
- THAT GUY OWES ME.

20:40.033 --> 20:42.633
I'M SERVING
HIS LIFE SENTENCE!

20:48.000 --> 20:52.500
- EXCELLENT WORK.

20:52.500 --> 20:53.833
- COME ON.
THEY'RE OUT THERE.

20:53.833 --> 20:56.967
WE GOT TO GO.

20:56.967 --> 20:59.233
ARE YOU COMING?

20:59.233 --> 21:03.300
- YOU NEVER LISTEN TO ME,
CAN YOU?

21:03.300 --> 21:06.433
[huffing and puffing]

21:13.567 --> 21:17.067
BOY, AMY AND GIANNI REALLY GOT
SOMETHING GOING, DON'T THEY?

21:17.067 --> 21:19.267
- ALL RIGHT, RAY, I SAW.

21:19.267 --> 21:22.167
- I'M JUST SAYING, THEY
WERE REALLY DIGGING EACH OTHER.

21:22.167 --> 21:25.567
- OKAY, RAY.

21:25.567 --> 21:28.067
YOU WERE RIGHT.

21:34.667 --> 21:36.400
- I WAS RIGHT.

21:37.900 --> 21:41.067
- SHOULD'VE LEARNED MY LESSON
THE FIRST TIME.

21:41.067 --> 21:42.633
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
THE FIRST TIME?

21:42.633 --> 21:44.067
- AH, IT WAS NOTHING.

21:44.067 --> 21:45.467
I HAD THIS BOYFRIEND IN COLLEGE,

21:45.467 --> 21:47.767
AND, YEAH,
HE WAS REALLY SOMETHING,

21:47.767 --> 21:49.067
AND WHEN HE BROKE UP WITH ME,

21:49.067 --> 21:51.067
I HAD THIS WHOLE PLAN
TO GET HIM BACK.

21:51.067 --> 21:52.233
- WHAT'D YOU DO?

21:52.233 --> 21:55.067
- I MARRIED YOU.
