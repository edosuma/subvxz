WEBVTT

00:06.207 --> 00:08.809
That was astounding.
You ate your sandwich,

00:08.842 --> 00:11.079
my sandwich,
and Bobby's sandwich.

00:11.112 --> 00:12.746
Hey, I'm eating for two.

00:12.780 --> 00:14.348
...hundred people.

00:14.382 --> 00:17.151
The waiters and I have
a bet going to see how much

00:17.185 --> 00:18.852
you can put away.
See, a few of the guys

00:18.886 --> 00:21.222
thought you'd quit
after the yam fries.

00:21.255 --> 00:22.990
But I know you better than that.

00:23.023 --> 00:25.059
Attagirl.

00:25.093 --> 00:26.827
And it's great to see you
feeding that baby

00:26.860 --> 00:28.329
growing inside you.

00:28.362 --> 00:29.930
Yeah, great for you. We're
the ones that have to stop

00:29.963 --> 00:32.200
at Burger Barn on the
way home for round two.

00:32.233 --> 00:35.403
Classic Bob. Always
quick with a quip.

00:35.436 --> 00:39.373
I'm looking forward to more of
that fun banter tomorrow night.

00:40.074 --> 00:41.409
Tomorrow night?

00:41.442 --> 00:43.344
Tomorrow night's guy's night,
did you invite him?

00:43.377 --> 00:44.412
I did.

00:44.445 --> 00:45.946
Wha... why?

00:45.979 --> 00:46.947
Every Friday night,

00:46.980 --> 00:48.582
the girls and I do our thing

00:48.616 --> 00:51.119
and you guys do your thing and
I feel like Lowell's left out.

00:51.152 --> 00:53.287
It'd be nice to include him.
What's the big deal?

00:53.321 --> 00:55.589
The big deal is that
guy's night is for dudes.

00:55.623 --> 00:56.857
Yeah.

00:56.890 --> 00:59.193
Yeah, and Lowell's
not really a dude.

00:59.227 --> 01:02.196
He's got a penis;
how is he not a dude?

01:02.230 --> 01:05.699
Yogurt panna cotta
with stewed rhubarb

01:05.733 --> 01:08.236
showered with pansies.

01:10.271 --> 01:12.473
Boy, sometimes
you ask a question

01:12.506 --> 01:14.675
and the universe
gives you an answer.

01:28.256 --> 01:32.726
For the last time:
you have 13 items.

01:32.760 --> 01:35.463
I have nine items.

01:35.496 --> 01:38.566
Coffee, wine, pickles, bacon,
tampons, chocolate, onions,

01:38.599 --> 01:40.634
condoms and frosting.

01:40.668 --> 01:43.237
You have five onions.

01:43.271 --> 01:46.274
And I don't even want to count
how many condoms you have.

01:47.141 --> 01:49.610
Yeah? Well,
I'm safe and popular,

01:49.643 --> 01:51.845
so scan me through.

01:51.879 --> 01:54.615
Hi... Arthur.

01:54.648 --> 01:56.450
Hi.

01:57.951 --> 02:00.954
Wha... You're
scanning her through?

02:00.988 --> 02:02.523
What happened to
12 items or less?

02:02.556 --> 02:05.959
It's like she's shopping
for a hurricane.

02:05.993 --> 02:07.761
Oh, my God. Is this
an express lane?

02:07.795 --> 02:09.697
I had no idea,
I am so sorry.

02:09.730 --> 02:11.632
It's okay,
honest mistake.

02:12.733 --> 02:14.202
Oh, I get it.

02:14.235 --> 02:15.636
It's happening again.

02:15.669 --> 02:17.104
What's happening again?

02:17.137 --> 02:19.173
You're getting special
treatment 'cause you're hot.

02:19.207 --> 02:21.309
Excuse me?

02:21.342 --> 02:23.277
You're hot. You're very hot,
you know you're hot.

02:23.311 --> 02:24.812
That leads people
to give you things,

02:24.845 --> 02:27.114
because gorgeous people get
things that other people don't.

02:27.147 --> 02:29.483
Okay, I am a little
hurt by that.

02:29.517 --> 02:32.520
Oh, my God, do you need me
to call a manager?

02:32.553 --> 02:35.789
Manager on register two,
manager on register two.

02:35.823 --> 02:37.391
It's okay,
Arthur, thank you.

02:37.425 --> 02:39.327
Thank you,
I got this.

02:39.360 --> 02:40.461
People are nice to me

02:40.494 --> 02:41.895
because I'm nice to them.

02:41.929 --> 02:44.031
It's true, she's enchanting.

02:44.064 --> 02:46.700
I hope you get demoted
to the regular lane.

02:46.734 --> 02:50.504
I cannot believe
you went there.

02:54.842 --> 02:56.744
Hi, Wanda.

02:56.777 --> 02:57.978
Andi,

02:58.011 --> 03:00.314
look at you, you're glowing.

03:00.348 --> 03:02.550
Oh, it's sweat.

03:02.583 --> 03:04.918
I ate three burritos.
I got the meat sweats.

03:06.119 --> 03:08.155
I'm disgusting.

03:08.188 --> 03:09.990
No, you pregnant.
Hm.

03:10.023 --> 03:12.660
Anyway, I'm surprising Bobby
with lunch.
- All right,

03:12.693 --> 03:14.828
Mrs. Gilbert needs
to come back in six
months. And tell her

03:14.862 --> 03:17.931
I know those things aren't
getting up there by accident.

03:17.965 --> 03:19.533
Hi, Will.

03:19.567 --> 03:21.201
Hey, Andi.

03:22.436 --> 03:23.704
Who's that?

03:23.737 --> 03:25.539
Oh, that's Raquel.

03:25.573 --> 03:26.574
She's gorgeous.

03:26.607 --> 03:28.342
She's the Playmate
of the Year.

03:28.376 --> 03:30.444
Oh, my God, you have
a Playmate patient?

03:30.478 --> 03:32.045
She's not my patient,
she's Bobby's.

03:32.079 --> 03:33.847
Oh, my God, for how long?

03:33.881 --> 03:35.516
Couple years.

03:35.549 --> 03:37.285
Oh, my God, what is she in for?

03:37.318 --> 03:39.820
Just the standard vagina stuff.

03:41.422 --> 03:43.190
Andi, what
a great surprise.

03:43.223 --> 03:45.025
Raquel, I'm ready
for you.

03:45.058 --> 03:48.429
You can go on inside and get
undressed, I'll be right in.
Thank you.

03:49.830 --> 03:51.399
Whoa.

03:51.432 --> 03:53.401
Somebody smells
like burritos.

03:54.735 --> 03:56.704
I'll meet you
in the office after?

03:56.737 --> 03:57.871
What are you doing?

03:57.905 --> 03:59.973
Oh, just warming up my hands.

04:07.915 --> 04:10.150
Like I said, when you're nice to
people, they're nice in return.

04:10.183 --> 04:11.819
Try it and you'll see.
Fine,

04:11.852 --> 04:14.388
I will be incredibly pleasant,
and because I'm not

04:14.422 --> 04:17.658
all of that, it will not make
a bit of difference.

04:19.092 --> 04:20.294
Hi, Arthur.

04:20.328 --> 04:21.729
Don't know if you remember me.

04:21.762 --> 04:23.931
Oh, the tampon-onion-condom
lady.

04:26.334 --> 04:28.902
Look, I-I think we got off
on the wrong foot yesterday,

04:28.936 --> 04:30.604
and I want to apologize.

04:31.439 --> 04:32.973
All right, I am listening.

04:33.006 --> 04:36.444
I didn't mean to devalue you
or the rules of the supermarket.

04:36.477 --> 04:37.611
And I like your vest.

04:37.645 --> 04:39.747
The blue really
matches your eyes.

04:39.780 --> 04:43.717
They're actually
green, but compliment taken.

04:44.952 --> 04:46.520
Would you like
a Mylar balloon

04:46.554 --> 04:48.522
that we normally
only give to toddlers?

04:48.556 --> 04:50.824
Oh, no, that's o...
Okay, thank you.

04:50.858 --> 04:54.261
Well, a smile is the raincoat
you wear in the sunshine.

04:54.294 --> 04:56.364
Wow, what a thing to say.

04:56.397 --> 04:58.932
Would you care to donate
to children in need?

04:58.966 --> 05:00.267
I would love to.

05:00.300 --> 05:01.602
Great, just
enter the amount

05:01.635 --> 05:03.136
you would care to
give on the keypad.

05:03.170 --> 05:05.005
Okay.

05:05.038 --> 05:09.543
Shoot, uh, I-I meant to press
five, but I punched in 50.

05:09.577 --> 05:11.311
All right, $50 it is.
No-no-no.

05:11.345 --> 05:12.513
No, I meant to press five,

05:12.546 --> 05:14.382
so you just need
to give me back $45.

05:14.415 --> 05:18.486
You want to take $45 away
from the children?

05:18.519 --> 05:20.220
No, I'm not
taking anything away,

05:20.253 --> 05:22.322
I never meant to give that much.
Have you

05:22.356 --> 05:24.124
seen these children?

05:24.157 --> 05:27.027
Do you know what
they've been through?

05:27.060 --> 05:28.596
They don't have a balloon.

05:29.597 --> 05:31.399
They can have my balloon.

05:31.432 --> 05:33.734
And I'll take my $45,

05:33.767 --> 05:37.371
so just open the drawer
and give me the money.
Is this a robbery?

05:37.405 --> 05:39.973
Yes, it's a robbery, you are
stealing my money...
Okay, we're leaving.

05:40.007 --> 05:41.775
We're leaving.

05:43.677 --> 05:45.379
I don't get it,
what did I do wrong?

05:45.413 --> 05:47.548
You should have told me
you had a Playmate patient.

05:47.581 --> 05:49.316
I never discuss my patients.

05:49.349 --> 05:51.218
Plus, I don't think
of her as a Playmate.

05:51.251 --> 05:52.319
I'm a gynecologist.

05:52.352 --> 05:54.422
A vagina is a vagina
is a vagina.

05:54.455 --> 05:56.156
Okay, but you look
at the magazine.

05:56.189 --> 05:58.392
Well, yeah, that's
just me being a guy.

05:58.426 --> 06:01.762
Okay, so which part of you is
the "gy," and which part
of you is the "necologist?"

06:01.795 --> 06:03.664
Andi, this is crazy.
I'm a doctor.

06:03.697 --> 06:05.399
What, are you gonna
have a problem

06:05.433 --> 06:07.034
with every Playmate
patient I have?

06:07.067 --> 06:08.869
There are others?

06:09.603 --> 06:11.539
Yeah, well, you get February,

06:11.572 --> 06:13.006
February tells November,

06:13.040 --> 06:15.042
November's like, "Hey, October."

06:16.977 --> 06:18.779
So how many are there?

06:18.812 --> 06:21.014
I don't know... six.

06:21.048 --> 06:22.249
Six.

06:22.282 --> 06:23.884
...teen, 16.

06:23.917 --> 06:27.187
16? There's only
12 months in the year.

06:27.220 --> 06:29.890
Yeah, well,
sometimes it's twins.

06:34.161 --> 06:35.929
So Lowell is joining us
for guy's night.

06:35.963 --> 06:37.531
Yeah, well,

06:37.565 --> 06:38.632
you know, I thought about it,
and Andi had a good point

06:38.666 --> 06:39.867
about him being left out.

06:39.900 --> 06:41.368
And she saw Raquel.

06:41.401 --> 06:43.471
Just trying to make
my life easier.

06:43.504 --> 06:46.373
So, what's on tap
for tonight?

06:46.406 --> 06:47.541
Oh, just a little

06:47.575 --> 06:51.144
something called
red velvet cupcakes!

06:51.178 --> 06:53.413
Ah...

06:53.447 --> 06:56.484
Cupcake, I cannot wait
to put you inside me.

06:59.820 --> 07:01.421
Too far?

07:03.824 --> 07:05.225
Oh, it's getting
ready to start.

07:05.258 --> 07:06.594
Here we go.
All right.

07:09.429 --> 07:10.330
G'day, lads!

07:10.363 --> 07:11.732
Hey!
Hey!
Here we go.

07:11.765 --> 07:14.468
Oh, I thought the girls
were out tonight.

07:15.936 --> 07:17.004
They are.

07:17.037 --> 07:18.839
Then what's with
the wine and the cupcakes?

07:20.040 --> 07:21.942
And what are you
watching?

07:22.843 --> 07:25.178
The Good Wife.

07:27.047 --> 07:28.248
It's a good show.

07:28.281 --> 07:30.450
What kind
of dude's night is this?

07:30.484 --> 07:32.319
What are you gonna do later,
braid each other's hair

07:32.352 --> 07:34.888
and cut pictures of boys
out of magazines?

07:36.289 --> 07:38.492
First of all...

07:38.526 --> 07:40.093
this is a red
velvet cupcake

07:40.127 --> 07:41.495
with buttercream
frosting.

07:41.529 --> 07:43.664
And it pairs beautifully
with this Pinot Grigio.

07:43.697 --> 07:45.633
What?
No, boys, come on.

07:45.666 --> 07:47.167
I thought we'd
start drinking here,

07:47.200 --> 07:48.201
then we'd go
to a bar

07:48.235 --> 07:49.302
and we'd drink
some more,

07:49.336 --> 07:50.604
and then we'd come back here

07:50.638 --> 07:52.139
and keep bloody drinking.

07:52.172 --> 07:55.108
Duh.
I mean...
Of course.

07:55.142 --> 07:56.376
You misunderstood us.

07:56.409 --> 07:57.778
We-we like to start
with the cupcakes

07:57.811 --> 07:59.279
to line our stomachs
for the bourbon

07:59.312 --> 08:00.948
and-and
the whiskey.
Right.

08:00.981 --> 08:03.183
Bourbon is whiskey, Bob.

08:04.484 --> 08:06.286
Obviously.

08:06.319 --> 08:07.320
We're testing you.

08:07.354 --> 08:08.889
Give me that.

08:08.922 --> 08:10.558
There it is.

08:15.896 --> 08:16.964
Oh...

08:16.997 --> 08:18.098
burns.

08:19.733 --> 08:20.834
Burns...

08:27.507 --> 08:29.877
Just admit I'm right
and you're wrong.

08:29.910 --> 08:32.212
I was nice and he still
didn't ring me up.

08:32.245 --> 08:33.547
Okay, you weren't nice.

08:33.581 --> 08:35.515
You tried to steal money
from starving children.

08:35.549 --> 08:37.718
I went through
this with Arthur,

08:37.751 --> 08:39.753
I went through this
with store security,

08:39.787 --> 08:42.690
I'm not gonna go
through it with you.

08:42.723 --> 08:45.158
You are never
gonna believe

08:45.192 --> 08:46.694
who Bobby's
patient is.

08:46.727 --> 08:49.897
Raquel Pomplun,
Playmate of the Year.

08:49.930 --> 08:51.198
No!
Really?

08:51.231 --> 08:53.166
Yes. And not just her,
there are other Playmates

08:53.200 --> 08:55.836
and actresses
and, like, five supermodels.

08:56.870 --> 09:00.173
Bobby's had his hands
on supervag?

09:00.207 --> 09:01.675
I know.

09:01.709 --> 09:03.543
This whole time I thought
that he was examining

09:03.577 --> 09:05.613
ordinary, run-of-the-mill
women all day.

09:05.646 --> 09:08.381
I thought I was his supervag.

09:08.415 --> 09:10.684
First of all,
Bobby worships you.

09:10.718 --> 09:12.352
Second of all,
a pretty face

09:12.385 --> 09:14.187
does not necessarily
mean a pretty vag.

09:14.221 --> 09:15.555
It's true.

09:15.589 --> 09:19.627
For all we know, this
one's is a horror show.

09:21.228 --> 09:23.296
Okay, mine...
is very pretty.

09:23.330 --> 09:24.865
And nice.

09:24.898 --> 09:26.299
But it's true.

09:26.333 --> 09:27.635
Gorgeous women
can have gross ones,

09:27.668 --> 09:29.202
and gross women
can have gorgeous ones.

09:29.236 --> 09:30.638
Remember
Suzette DiPrima?
Yes.

09:30.671 --> 09:32.205
Stunning face.

09:32.239 --> 09:34.775
They called her
flapjacks.

09:36.076 --> 09:39.379
You know, because there
was sort of a...
Yes, we got it.

09:39.412 --> 09:40.981
Thank you.

09:42.415 --> 09:44.551
Maybe I'm just
getting in my head.

09:44.584 --> 09:46.219
I'm sure mine is just as great

09:46.253 --> 09:48.088
as Bobby's gorgeous patients.

09:48.121 --> 09:50.791
Well...
Eh...

09:50.824 --> 09:52.292
What?

09:52.325 --> 09:55.262
We've seen you
in the sauna.

09:55.295 --> 09:56.596
And?

09:56.630 --> 09:58.165
Let's just say

09:58.198 --> 10:00.233
the garden's
gotten a little...

10:00.267 --> 10:02.135
overgrown.
Yeah.

10:03.637 --> 10:06.339
When was the last time
you got a wax?

10:06.373 --> 10:07.407
I don't know.

10:07.440 --> 10:09.009
Who keeps track of these things?

10:09.042 --> 10:10.477
Most women.

10:10.510 --> 10:12.312
Forgive me if,
in my current state,

10:12.345 --> 10:14.748
I don't want to get naked
in front of some stranger.

10:14.782 --> 10:16.083
You don't have
to go to a stranger.

10:16.116 --> 10:18.285
There are at-home
waxing kits.
Yeah.

10:18.318 --> 10:19.352
I'll buy one
for you,

10:19.386 --> 10:20.587
and you can hack
through it

10:20.620 --> 10:22.890
in the privacy of
your own home.

10:24.357 --> 10:25.625
I mean, really?

10:25.659 --> 10:26.927
Do you want your baby
to enter the world

10:26.960 --> 10:29.797
through
that haystack?

10:34.167 --> 10:37.104
I feel horrible.

10:41.141 --> 10:43.610
Why is it so dark?

10:43.643 --> 10:48.215
'Cause your hand
is covering your face.

10:48.248 --> 10:50.617
Rise and shine, boys.

10:50.650 --> 10:52.052
Lowell, are you not hungover?

10:52.085 --> 10:54.654
Oh, yeah, I've never been
in more pain in my life.

10:54.688 --> 10:56.824
Pancakes?

11:00.728 --> 11:04.631
Why are my underwear
in my pocket?

11:04.664 --> 11:06.734
That's my underwear.

11:09.002 --> 11:10.704
How do you reckon
we got back here?

11:10.738 --> 11:12.873
'Cause I don't remember anything
after Bobby threw up

11:12.906 --> 11:15.876
and we got kicked out
of that taxi.

11:15.909 --> 11:19.713
I remember break-dancing
in the mall for money.

11:24.084 --> 11:25.252
I remember bikes.

11:25.285 --> 11:26.386
I remember bikes.

11:26.419 --> 11:27.821
Did we buy bikes?

11:27.855 --> 11:30.423
Did we steal bikes?

11:31.291 --> 11:33.293
Not just any bikes.

11:38.431 --> 11:39.833
Police bikes!

11:39.867 --> 11:42.035
We stole police bikes!

11:42.069 --> 11:44.204
From the police.

11:49.142 --> 11:51.011
Oh, my God!
Shh!

11:51.044 --> 11:52.880
Andi and Charlie
are still sleeping.

11:52.913 --> 11:54.681
And panicking
doesn't help anyone.

11:54.714 --> 11:55.682
Who's panicking?

11:55.715 --> 11:57.985
This is bloody awesome!

11:59.152 --> 12:01.855
Nothing like a prank
to bring the boys together, eh?

12:01.889 --> 12:03.891
It's not a prank.
It's a crime.

12:03.924 --> 12:07.961
We stole police bikes.
From the police.

12:07.995 --> 12:10.230
Okay, I'm sure
if we just take them back

12:10.263 --> 12:12.699
and explain to the police,
they'll understand.

12:12.732 --> 12:14.367
Oh, yeah, sure.
'Cause if there's one thing

12:14.401 --> 12:18.738
the LAPD is famous for,
it's their understanding.

12:21.274 --> 12:22.609
We could go to jail.

12:22.642 --> 12:26.713
Cupcakes and The Good Wife
just weren't enough for you.

12:26.746 --> 12:28.048
Don't put this on me.

12:28.081 --> 12:29.382
You guys said you go drinking
all the time.

12:29.416 --> 12:32.085
Clearly we were lying!
All right, all right.

12:32.119 --> 12:34.554
Look, let's not point
fingers, all right?

12:34.587 --> 12:37.390
We all know this
is Lowell's fault.
What?

12:37.424 --> 12:38.926
All right, look,

12:38.959 --> 12:40.828
we need a game plan, all right?
We got to have these bikes

12:40.861 --> 12:42.395
out of here
before Andi wakes up,

12:42.429 --> 12:46.599
and the police station
is seven blocks away...

12:46.633 --> 12:48.001
And?

12:48.035 --> 12:51.471
Sorry. I thought
I was gonna throw up again.

12:52.840 --> 12:54.174
We take
the bikes

12:54.207 --> 12:55.809
through side streets and alleys
Yeah.

12:55.843 --> 12:58.846
and we do what any responsible
adult would do...

12:58.879 --> 13:01.348
leave 'em at the police station
and run away.

13:02.649 --> 13:06.653
Excuse me, miss, could you
go a little faster, please?

13:06.686 --> 13:09.356
I'm trying not
to draw attention to us.

13:09.389 --> 13:12.359
We're going so slow
my bike keeps tipping over.

13:12.392 --> 13:13.593
Cops!

13:13.626 --> 13:14.661
What? What? Where?
Where are the cops?

13:14.694 --> 13:17.965
It's us. We are the cops.

13:19.967 --> 13:22.836
Bet you these are the kids
that egged Mr. Kaplan's car.

13:22.870 --> 13:25.873
I mean, sure, Kaplan's
a douche, but still...

13:25.906 --> 13:28.008
Hi, Officers. We weren't
doing anything. I swear.

13:28.041 --> 13:31.144
Actually we're not...
We're not
gonna arrest you this time.

13:31.178 --> 13:36.549
But we're gonna be watching you,
you little sons of bitches.

13:37.817 --> 13:39.519
Now step away from that stuff!

13:40.587 --> 13:43.790
Yeah. Or else we'll...
shoot you.

13:43.823 --> 13:46.459
What?
No, we're not
gonna shoot them.

13:46.493 --> 13:48.628
But we will arrest you.

13:48.661 --> 13:50.230
Please don't.
My parents will kill me.

13:50.263 --> 13:53.833
Well, lucky for you,
we're feeling generous today.

13:53.867 --> 13:55.635
We'll let you off
with just a warning.

13:55.668 --> 13:58.371
Stay in school
and don't do drugs.

13:59.339 --> 14:01.241
Now get out of here,
you little perps.

14:01.274 --> 14:02.409
Go on. Get!

14:05.545 --> 14:07.814
That was awesome.
Right?

14:07.847 --> 14:09.549
How badass were we just then?

14:09.582 --> 14:10.683
And you
with the American accent.

14:10.717 --> 14:11.919
"Perps"? Where'd you learn that?

14:11.952 --> 14:15.355
Jules loves Law & Order.
Chung-chung.

14:16.023 --> 14:18.758
Well, we had
our fun here.

14:18.791 --> 14:20.894
I think we all know
what we need to do now.

14:54.161 --> 14:55.895
All right,
the wax is almost ready.

14:55.929 --> 15:00.067
30 seconds
till the deforestation begins.

15:00.100 --> 15:02.469
I can't believe I'm doing this.
I mean, the best part

15:02.502 --> 15:06.039
of being married, you guys, is
that you get to let yourself go.

15:06.073 --> 15:09.809
What about love,
companionship, intimacy?

15:14.781 --> 15:16.716
Anyway, you're not doing this
for Bobby.

15:16.749 --> 15:18.051
You're doing this for you.

15:18.085 --> 15:19.386
And us. Seriously,

15:19.419 --> 15:21.421
going to the beach with you
is traumatizing.

15:21.454 --> 15:22.990
Andi,

15:23.023 --> 15:24.724
you're gonna have to trim first.
Do you have scissors?

15:24.757 --> 15:25.925
I do.

15:25.959 --> 15:27.160
Okay, well,

15:27.194 --> 15:29.997
let's not set the
scissors up to fail.

15:33.866 --> 15:37.204
Now go give that
kitty a crew cut.

15:39.172 --> 15:41.241
Well, we cleaned up
the streets

15:41.274 --> 15:44.677
of this upper
middle-class neighborhood.

15:44.711 --> 15:47.280
Maybe time
to return these bad boys.

15:48.781 --> 15:50.117
One more lap?

15:50.150 --> 15:52.085
Just to make sure
everything's safe.

15:52.119 --> 15:54.354
To protect and serve.

15:54.387 --> 15:55.955
Boom!

15:55.989 --> 15:57.290
All right.

15:59.859 --> 16:01.028
Cops!

16:13.006 --> 16:15.942
Hi, Officers.
Yeah, I know

16:15.975 --> 16:17.510
how this looks,
but, actually,

16:17.544 --> 16:20.013
we can explain.
You see, last night...
I stole the bikes.

16:20.047 --> 16:21.814
What?
Bob,

16:21.848 --> 16:23.783
you're a dad and
you're a doctor, mate.

16:23.816 --> 16:25.518
All right, you got
too much to lose.

16:25.552 --> 16:28.721
Look, I got really drunk last
night. I made a stupid mistake.

16:28.755 --> 16:31.324
My friends were just helping
me return the bikes. So...

16:31.358 --> 16:35.262
if you're gonna arrest
anyone, it should be me.

16:38.665 --> 16:42.135
Well, it seems like you feel
pretty bad about it. Uh...

16:42.169 --> 16:44.704
how 'bout you take the bikes
back down to the station.

16:44.737 --> 16:46.573
We'll, uh, forget
the whole thing.

16:46.606 --> 16:48.141
Really? Officers,

16:48.175 --> 16:50.243
thank you so much.
This'll never happen again.
Thank you.

16:50.277 --> 16:53.046
Thank you! Have a good day!

16:53.080 --> 16:57.184
Think we should've told
'em we were strippers?

17:04.957 --> 17:07.360
I'm hot.
Yes, exactly,

17:07.394 --> 17:10.930
you're hot. That's why the world
gives you things.

17:10.963 --> 17:14.067
No, I mean I'm physically warm.

17:14.101 --> 17:15.835
And my eye is all itchy.

17:15.868 --> 17:18.171
Guys, the wax
isn't getting hard.

17:18.205 --> 17:20.707
It's still
all sticky.

17:20.740 --> 17:21.941
What happened?

17:21.974 --> 17:23.876
I knocked stuff
off the counter. Oh, no.

17:23.910 --> 17:27.547
Now a toothbrush
is stuck on there.

17:28.415 --> 17:30.383
Nope, got it off.

17:30.417 --> 17:32.752
Don't tell Will.

17:33.886 --> 17:36.923
Well, the wax
should be hard by now.

17:36.956 --> 17:40.193
Well, it's not. Can you read
the instructions, please?
Okay.

17:40.227 --> 17:42.695
"Apply wax to desired area."

17:42.729 --> 17:44.431
It's all over
the desired area.

17:44.464 --> 17:48.535
And it's dripping
into some very undesired areas.

17:48.568 --> 17:51.938
"Immediately use fabric strips
to remove."

17:51.971 --> 17:53.306
There are
no fabric strips.

17:53.340 --> 17:56.776
"Fabric strips sold separately."

17:56.809 --> 17:58.311
What? What'd you just say?

17:58.345 --> 18:00.813
Get your stuff, get your stuff.
We're going.

18:00.847 --> 18:03.316
Guys? Guys?

18:03.350 --> 18:05.218
Um, I think we have a problem.

18:05.252 --> 18:07.820
Yeah, no kidding
we have a problem.
Guys?

18:07.854 --> 18:10.056
No, no, no, no, no. I touched
the wax and then touched my eye,

18:10.089 --> 18:11.958
and I think I'm having
an allergic reaction.

18:11.991 --> 18:13.326
Does it look bad?

18:13.360 --> 18:15.795
You know, I think the
swelling's going down.

18:15.828 --> 18:18.165
Really?

18:18.198 --> 18:21.501
No, your eye looks like
a sideways vagina.

18:22.835 --> 18:25.238
Look, I'm sorry I didn't check
if the wax had paraben in it.

18:25.272 --> 18:27.607
I can't keep track of
everything you're allergic to.

18:27.640 --> 18:31.644
Paraben. Paraben is
the only thing I'm allergic to.

18:31.678 --> 18:33.413
You know what?
I just want to get my Benadryl

18:33.446 --> 18:35.315
and my calamine
and my ice creams.

18:35.348 --> 18:37.417
And I just want to go home.

18:40.119 --> 18:42.755
I'm sorry, that is clearly

18:42.789 --> 18:44.157
more than 12 items.

18:44.191 --> 18:46.259
Oh, no, Arthur, it's me.

18:46.293 --> 18:47.460
The nice girl from yesterday.

18:47.494 --> 18:48.995
I just, I had
an allergic reaction.

18:49.028 --> 18:50.830
And I'm in a bit
of a rush, so...

18:50.863 --> 18:52.098
Oh, interesting.

18:52.131 --> 18:54.133
Anyone else here
in a bit of a rush?

18:54.167 --> 18:56.669
Wait, I'm confused.

18:56.703 --> 18:59.306
When she was in before, you
let her sail right through.

18:59.339 --> 19:02.141
Hmm, I wonder
what's different?

19:02.175 --> 19:03.443
Arthur.

19:03.476 --> 19:05.612
You're not dissing me
because of this?

19:05.645 --> 19:06.813
No.

19:08.181 --> 19:10.350
I'm dissing you because
you have more than 12 items.

19:10.383 --> 19:14.287
This... is God's problem.

19:14.321 --> 19:16.456
Oh, you know what, Arthur?

19:16.489 --> 19:18.124
Why don't you take
that smile raincoat

19:18.157 --> 19:19.392
and shove it up your...

19:19.426 --> 19:21.394
We're going.

19:23.530 --> 19:24.697
They ran away.

19:24.731 --> 19:28.134
They both ran away
and I had to deal with it.

19:28.167 --> 19:30.203
I had to use one
of Charlie's dinosaur toys

19:30.237 --> 19:31.904
to scrape it off.

19:31.938 --> 19:35.007
Well, why were you in that
situation in the first place?

19:35.041 --> 19:37.410
Because I wanted to be
pretty down there.

19:37.444 --> 19:40.713
What with all the vaginal glory
you stare at all day.

19:40.747 --> 19:43.483
Oh, my God, is that what
this is about-- Raquel?

19:43.516 --> 19:46.018
I can't compete with Playmates.

19:46.052 --> 19:48.221
Ever since I had Charlie,
whenever I sneeze,

19:48.255 --> 19:50.423
a little pee comes out.

19:50.457 --> 19:52.659
You don't have to compete.

19:52.692 --> 19:55.027
No one's comparing
you to them but you.

19:55.061 --> 19:57.930
Andi, I think you're the sexiest
woman in the whole world.

19:57.964 --> 19:59.666
Really?
Yes.

19:59.699 --> 20:01.768
And in my professional
and personal opinion,

20:01.801 --> 20:03.670
your vagina's perfect.

20:03.703 --> 20:05.572
Thank you.

20:05.605 --> 20:06.573
I love you.

20:06.606 --> 20:07.807
I love you, too.

20:19.419 --> 20:20.587
What?

20:21.554 --> 20:23.590
Nothing.

20:32.665 --> 20:36.636
Okay, The Good Wife
is fantastic.

20:36.669 --> 20:39.906
Julianna Margulies is strong,
yet she's so vulnerable.

20:39.939 --> 20:41.040
Right?

20:41.073 --> 20:42.442
She lights up the screen.

20:42.475 --> 20:43.209
Cheers!

20:43.242 --> 20:44.777
Cheers!

20:46.178 --> 20:48.981
Oh... top off my Pinot
for me, will you?

20:53.185 --> 20:54.721
Hello?
- Eat it, you douche.

20:56.255 --> 20:57.990
Bulls-eye!

21:03.330 --> 21:05.732
Those little sons of bitches.
