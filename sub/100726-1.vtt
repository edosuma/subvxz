00:23.357 --> 00:25.190
<i>You know those
teen vampire movies</i>

00:25.192 --> 00:27.292
<i>that feel like the horny
soap opera fever dreams</i>

00:27.294 --> 00:29.096
<i>of a sentient
eight-grade diary?</i>

00:31.431 --> 00:33.166
<i>Here's how this one ended.</i>

00:35.435 --> 00:37.037
<i>Here's how mine began.</i>

00:58.258 --> 01:01.194
Thank you for this.
Thank you.

01:02.864 --> 01:04.296
I love you.

01:04.298 --> 01:05.399
I love you too.

01:07.401 --> 01:08.701
What about sunlight?

01:08.703 --> 01:10.636
No,
it will make you sick

01:10.638 --> 01:12.337
and it's blinding,
but it won't hurt you.

01:12.339 --> 01:13.806
- Uh, garlic?
- No.

01:13.808 --> 01:15.173
- Uh, crosses?
- No!

01:15.175 --> 01:16.676
No, not sticks,
nor holy water,

01:16.678 --> 01:18.578
or anything like that
can hurt you.

01:18.580 --> 01:20.211
The only thing
we need to worry about...

01:20.213 --> 01:21.214
Is me.

01:23.317 --> 01:24.318
Duke, don't!

01:31.793 --> 01:32.858
Hold her down.

01:42.604 --> 01:44.872
You poor thing!

01:46.541 --> 01:47.740
I bet you thought
you were the hero

01:47.742 --> 01:49.842
of your own little movie.

01:49.844 --> 01:52.243
Finally, you've been bitten
by the radioactive spider

01:52.245 --> 01:54.214
confirming what you've
always suspected.

01:54.782 --> 01:56.116
That you are, in fact,

01:56.818 --> 01:58.686
a special center
of the universe.

02:02.790 --> 02:03.791
I love him!

02:04.692 --> 02:05.793
No!

02:12.299 --> 02:14.232
But you're not special,

02:14.234 --> 02:16.902
and life isn't
a fucking movie.

02:16.904 --> 02:19.406
Except sometimes you do meet
the bad guys.

02:39.426 --> 02:41.461
You're going to
kill me now, too?

02:42.697 --> 02:44.164
Why would I do that?

02:50.872 --> 02:52.372
You messed up is all.

02:53.007 --> 02:54.474
And for a good reason.

02:55.009 --> 02:56.276
Love.

02:57.779 --> 02:59.614
The heart wants
what it wants, right?

03:01.949 --> 03:03.983
One year in the hole.

03:03.985 --> 03:05.853
I'm sorry, but you got to
learn to respect the rules.

03:07.287 --> 03:10.390
No fucking boys.

03:21.602 --> 03:22.702
<i>All right, everybody,</i>

03:22.704 --> 03:25.671

03:25.673 --> 03:28.841
<i>of Central Oregon High!</i>

03:49.329 --> 03:51.429
You don't think they're
gonna fuck right here, do you?

03:51.431 --> 03:52.633
God, I hope so.

03:53.868 --> 03:55.568
Why do we even come
to these things?

03:55.570 --> 03:56.971
We don't.

03:58.606 --> 04:00.273
She better come up
for air.

04:02.810 --> 04:04.977
There it is.

04:04.979 --> 04:06.879
I wish somebody would burp
in my face like that.

04:06.881 --> 04:09.717
Same.

04:10.752 --> 04:12.618
Fucking same.

04:12.620 --> 04:16.021
<i>♪ Graduation, whoo! ♪</i>

04:16.023 --> 04:17.759
Uh-huh.

04:19.093 --> 04:20.959
Uh, look, I got something
I wanna tell you.

04:20.962 --> 04:22.027
Is that okay?

04:22.029 --> 04:23.629
- Yeah.
- Okay, okay.

04:23.631 --> 04:25.631
Um...

04:25.633 --> 04:26.932
I just wanna say...

04:26.934 --> 04:27.833
I wanna say,

04:27.835 --> 04:29.802
"Hey, what you've done
is just so cool."

04:29.804 --> 04:31.103
- So cool, you know?
- Uh-huh.

04:31.105 --> 04:32.605
Like, seriously, I just...

04:32.607 --> 04:36.509
I want to let you to know
that I really admire you.

04:36.511 --> 04:38.476
- It's so cool.
- Thanks.

04:38.478 --> 04:40.613
Okay, thank you for that.

04:40.615 --> 04:42.648
Hey, Laurel, come
check this out real quick.

04:42.650 --> 04:43.816
Yeah, no problem.

04:43.818 --> 04:45.753
Hey, can, can I...

04:47.722 --> 04:50.423
- Better keep in touch when you're down there.
- I will.

04:51.659 --> 04:52.525
You're gonna go down there

04:52.527 --> 04:54.093
and meet all these
interesting people

04:54.095 --> 04:55.293
and you're gonna forget
all about me.

04:55.295 --> 04:57.763
And I'm gonna have to live
vicariously through your snaps.

04:57.765 --> 04:59.865
I'm only gonna be gone
a couple months.

04:59.867 --> 05:01.502
You're never coming back here.

05:03.938 --> 05:05.838
That's what happens.

05:05.840 --> 05:07.072
Friends you make
in high school

05:07.074 --> 05:08.607
are just the people
you're stuck with.

05:08.609 --> 05:10.709
They're friends
by forced proximity.

05:10.711 --> 05:12.747
You're ridiculous,
you know that?

05:17.685 --> 05:19.151
You can come visit me.

05:19.153 --> 05:20.721
Well, maybe I will.

05:25.059 --> 05:26.959
Give Mark my love.

05:26.961 --> 05:28.160
Feel free to send me pics

05:28.162 --> 05:30.729
if you should maybe happen
to catch him in his underwear.

05:30.731 --> 05:32.565
Ew! That's my brother.

05:32.567 --> 05:33.701
It's what keeps us apart.

05:34.802 --> 05:35.803
Whatever.

05:37.572 --> 05:39.006
Just don't drift away.

05:40.741 --> 05:41.976
I won't.

05:45.646 --> 05:46.848
I need you, kid.

05:52.954 --> 05:54.555
Oh, get off of me.

05:59.961 --> 06:01.994
- Is that everything?
- Yup.

06:01.996 --> 06:04.597
Okay. Watch your gages now.

06:04.599 --> 06:06.532
Lots of cars overheat
on those roads coming into LA.

06:06.534 --> 06:07.766
I know.

06:07.768 --> 06:09.602
All right, I put a couple of
jugs of water in the back.

06:09.604 --> 06:11.371
Just in case. You're welcome.

06:11.806 --> 06:12.907
Thank you.

06:16.577 --> 06:18.010
Come on, she's going away
for the summer,

06:18.012 --> 06:19.111
she's not moving to Japan.

06:19.113 --> 06:20.813
I know. I know.

06:20.815 --> 06:24.016
Remember, be safe.

06:24.018 --> 06:26.919
- If you feel tired, pull over and rest.
- I will.

06:26.921 --> 06:29.555
Yes, but keep those
goddamn doors locked.

06:29.557 --> 06:31.523
Oh, my God, guys.
I'm gonna be fine.

06:31.525 --> 06:32.758
I want you to call me
every time you stop.

06:32.760 --> 06:34.459
And if you forget,
I'm buying a ticket

06:34.461 --> 06:35.761
and coming down there
to kill you.

06:35.763 --> 06:36.996
- I know.
- Don't ignore your mom.

06:36.998 --> 06:38.063
I won't.

06:38.065 --> 06:39.965
- She'll do it.
- I know she will.

06:39.967 --> 06:42.601
And for Pete's sake,
don't spend your time

06:42.603 --> 06:43.836
hovered over your computer

06:43.838 --> 06:46.471
or your phone
like you do here, all right?

06:46.473 --> 06:49.642
You're 18. Go and get in
some trouble.

06:49.644 --> 06:51.478
- Bill?
- What?

06:52.479 --> 06:54.113
You know what I mean.

06:54.115 --> 06:56.481
Your father and I
want to tell you

06:56.483 --> 06:59.854
we know it's been a hard year,
few years, but

07:00.688 --> 07:04.025
we're so proud of you.
Right, Bill?

07:04.892 --> 07:06.258
Thanks.

07:06.260 --> 07:08.594
Really, we mean it.

07:08.596 --> 07:11.096
- Go have fun. Be safe.
- I will.

07:11.098 --> 07:12.765
- I love you.
- I love you too.

07:12.767 --> 07:14.001
Okay.

07:15.236 --> 07:16.804
- Bye, guys.
- Bye.

07:17.738 --> 07:19.138
- Be safe.
- I will.

07:19.140 --> 07:20.906
- I love you.
- I love you too.

07:23.110 --> 07:24.512
Bye!

07:31.752 --> 07:33.953
Well, she's gone.

07:33.955 --> 07:35.890
Should we go have sex?

08:11.225 --> 08:12.624
<i>Where you at now?</i>

08:12.626 --> 08:15.627
Um, something like,
Pencildicktown.

08:15.629 --> 08:18.030
I think it's like Bakersfield,
or some shit.

08:18.032 --> 08:19.131
I don't know.

08:19.133 --> 08:21.333
<i>Did you hear?
Candice is crackhead.</i>

08:21.335 --> 08:23.569
What the fuck?

08:23.571 --> 08:24.972
<i>Can you believe
that shit?</i>

08:26.073 --> 08:27.575
Mmm-hmm.

08:29.610 --> 08:31.577
Okay, Andy,
I'm gonna call you back.

08:31.579 --> 08:35.014
I'm gonna need a greasy-ass cheeseburger
and I'm gonna stuff it in my face.

09:25.900 --> 09:27.301
Wake up, nerd.

09:30.738 --> 09:32.740
You scared me, jerk.

09:37.044 --> 09:38.811
How was the drive?

09:38.813 --> 09:40.179
The first six hours were great.

09:40.181 --> 09:41.380
Yeah.

09:41.382 --> 09:42.981
I feel like shit, though.

09:42.983 --> 09:45.252
Like I stepped out of
an elephant's mouth.

09:47.788 --> 09:49.788
I've only been asleep
for three hours?

09:49.790 --> 09:51.356
Plenty of time.

09:51.358 --> 09:53.926
Just
a little bit more, please.

09:53.928 --> 09:54.993
- No!
- Please.

09:54.995 --> 09:56.895
No, we got places to go.

09:56.897 --> 09:57.996
So, get fancy, all right?

09:57.998 --> 10:00.334
And call Mom. She's pissed.

10:01.102 --> 10:02.367
Of course she is.

10:02.369 --> 10:05.206
Bathroom. Kitchen. My room.

10:06.107 --> 10:07.842
Yeah, make yourself at home.

10:08.342 --> 10:09.875
Where are we going?

10:09.877 --> 10:11.877
Yago, Death Valley Girls.

10:11.879 --> 10:13.278
Fuck, yes.

10:13.280 --> 10:15.447
Wait, one problem.
What's your ID sitch?

10:15.449 --> 10:18.016
- Works fine now.
- Okay, cool.

10:18.018 --> 10:21.253
If not, we'll send your ass back,
but I think we'll be golden.

10:21.255 --> 10:24.156
I'll stab the doorman
if I have to.

10:24.158 --> 10:26.191
I got some friends
I think are coming.

10:26.193 --> 10:28.127
They're not gonna be all
patronizing, are they?

10:28.129 --> 10:30.462
'Cause I'm really
not in the mood.

10:30.464 --> 10:32.733
People aren't like that here,
as much.

10:34.468 --> 10:35.868
Right, so listen,

10:35.870 --> 10:37.236
I know Mom sent you down
with some money,

10:37.238 --> 10:38.303
and you saved up
a little yourself...

10:38.305 --> 10:41.173
And I know she gave you some
for me to stay here.

10:41.175 --> 10:44.810
But I think
you should look for a job.

10:44.812 --> 10:46.245
I mean, I know
you're on vacation

10:46.247 --> 10:47.913
before you decide to do

10:47.915 --> 10:50.749
whatever it is you gonna do
with your life,

10:50.751 --> 10:51.817
but I think you're gonna
wanna stay here.

10:51.819 --> 10:52.951
With you?

10:52.953 --> 10:54.920
Yeah. Why not?

10:54.922 --> 10:57.189
I mean, you'd
move out eventually, I hope.

10:57.191 --> 10:59.260
Or go to college, I guess.

11:02.196 --> 11:04.196
All right, take a shower,
go get ready.

11:04.198 --> 11:05.731
Whatever you gotta do,
chop-chop.

11:05.733 --> 11:07.134
Let's go.

11:15.876 --> 11:17.843
Yo, hurry up.

11:17.845 --> 11:19.144
They're gonna be here
any minute.

11:19.146 --> 11:20.347
All right, just a sec.

12:18.105 --> 12:19.106
Okay.

12:33.287 --> 12:35.523
Yeah, uh, this is
out of state, so...

12:39.226 --> 12:41.228
- Sorry.
- What's the hold up?

12:42.463 --> 12:43.497
Uh, they were just, uh...

12:50.404 --> 12:51.805
Looks fine to me.

12:53.941 --> 12:55.209
Looks fine to me.

12:56.143 --> 12:57.311
Next, guys.

13:02.116 --> 13:04.785

15:04.004 --> 15:05.103
Oh, they canceled.

15:05.105 --> 15:07.172
It's something you got to get
used to around here.

15:07.174 --> 15:09.109

seeing the Death Valley Girls?

15:42.242 --> 15:43.343
Thanks.

15:55.289 --> 15:56.457
Hi.

15:58.793 --> 16:00.492
Hey.

16:00.494 --> 16:04.463
What's with the hamburger
and shoestring?

16:04.465 --> 16:06.666
Uh, it's a conversation starter.

16:06.668 --> 16:09.269
I like that, clever.

16:09.737 --> 16:11.470
I thought so.

16:11.472 --> 16:13.472
- What's your name?
- Laurel.

16:13.474 --> 16:16.241
- Izzy.
- Nice to meet you, Izzy.

16:16.243 --> 16:17.411
You're not from here, are you?

16:19.413 --> 16:21.716
- How can you tell?
- I just can.

16:23.083 --> 16:24.584
That's depressing.

16:24.586 --> 16:29.488
No, no. It's just
you're so enthusiastic.

16:29.490 --> 16:32.357
People live here long enough
and they get all self-conscious

16:32.359 --> 16:34.627
and jaded, it's so whack.

16:34.629 --> 16:36.495
This is actually
my first night here.

16:36.497 --> 16:38.564
- At the Yago?
- In LA.

16:38.566 --> 16:40.733
Oh, where are you from?

16:40.735 --> 16:43.335
- Oregon.
- You just moved here?

16:43.337 --> 16:44.639
No. Well...

16:46.240 --> 16:48.473
Maybe. I'm staying
with my brother.

16:48.475 --> 16:49.476
He's over there.

16:52.847 --> 16:56.248
Oh! Cool!

16:56.250 --> 16:58.149
Yeah, and, um...

16:58.151 --> 17:00.118
Tell your friend thanks,
by the way,

17:00.120 --> 17:01.554
for throwing her weight around
back there.

17:01.556 --> 17:02.757
Oh, Duke.

17:04.692 --> 17:06.026
She seems intense.

17:09.696 --> 17:10.765
She is.

17:14.134 --> 17:15.568
Hey, we're going to

17:15.569 --> 17:17.167
an afterhours party
in downtown,

17:17.170 --> 17:18.204
if you want to come.

17:19.339 --> 17:21.339
Oh, um...

17:25.680 --> 17:27.512
You don't have to
if you don't feel comfortable.

17:27.515 --> 17:30.083
No, uh, I'd love to.

17:30.552 --> 17:31.617
K.

17:31.619 --> 17:33.653
- K?
- Yeah.

17:33.655 --> 17:35.287
Is that something
people say here?

17:35.289 --> 17:37.155
Nah, just me and my friends.

17:37.157 --> 17:39.491
Oh, well... K.

17:39.493 --> 17:40.695
Hmm.

17:51.639 --> 17:54.141
- Don't go.
- Let go of me.

17:54.542 --> 17:55.643
Let go!

18:26.908 --> 18:29.341
Hey, I'm gonna
talk to them,

18:29.343 --> 18:30.442
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

18:30.444 --> 18:31.613
I'll just be a second.

19:27.568 --> 19:29.502
- You all right?
- Yeah.

19:29.504 --> 19:31.403
Uh, what is this place?

19:31.405 --> 19:33.506
Well, it used to be
a jewelry manufacturer.

19:33.508 --> 19:36.709
Then it became a place for bands
to rent out for rehearsal space.

19:36.711 --> 19:39.346
And now, it's our secret
party palace.

19:39.947 --> 19:42.548
- Who owns it?
- We do.

19:42.550 --> 19:44.917
- Crazy.
- Can I show you the best part?

19:44.919 --> 19:45.920
Sure.

19:54.962 --> 19:56.796
Ten goes straight to hustle.

19:56.798 --> 19:57.832
Yeah, no kidding.

19:58.766 --> 20:00.434
You got reamed.

20:02.269 --> 20:03.671
All right, let's see it.

20:05.640 --> 20:08.507
Come on, them's the rules, kid.

20:08.509 --> 20:10.277
- Kid?
- Son.

20:13.648 --> 20:16.416
Fine, fine.
Better give the lady what she wants.

20:20.021 --> 20:21.587
Not bad.

20:21.589 --> 20:24.557
Come on, don't act
like you're not impressed.

20:24.559 --> 20:26.559
You got enough blood in you
to work that thing?

20:26.561 --> 20:27.927
What?

20:27.929 --> 20:29.762
If I take you upstairs,
you're not gonna get all

20:29.764 --> 20:31.431
stage frighty on me, are you?

20:32.133 --> 20:33.868
No, uh, I... I don't think so.

20:36.537 --> 20:38.438
No, no. Definitely not.

20:38.973 --> 20:41.542
All right. Let's go.

20:43.911 --> 20:45.312
You can come too.

20:46.881 --> 20:48.315
Everyone out by 4:00.

20:52.920 --> 20:53.988
Boo.

21:31.626 --> 21:34.392
Is it corny that I'm looking
for the Hollywood sign?

21:34.394 --> 21:35.694
No.

21:35.696 --> 21:37.330
But you can't see it form here.

21:38.132 --> 21:40.300
Feels like
I'm in a fricking movie.

21:41.102 --> 21:42.670
You guys live here?

21:43.104 --> 21:45.538
Sometimes.

21:45.540 --> 21:49.407
Okay, so are you all like
bank robbers or something?

21:49.409 --> 21:51.110
I don't mean
to be rude, but like,

21:51.112 --> 21:53.712
how do you afford this?
Who are you?

21:53.714 --> 21:55.147
We're supervillains.

21:56.751 --> 21:58.451
You meant like
an app or something?

21:59.720 --> 22:00.788
No.

22:02.489 --> 22:03.558
What do you do?

22:05.760 --> 22:07.061
Sorry, is that rude?

22:07.662 --> 22:09.795
No, it's cool.

22:09.797 --> 22:11.697
I direct music videos.

22:11.699 --> 22:13.464
Oh!

22:13.466 --> 22:15.601
Anything I've seen?

22:15.603 --> 22:18.537
Uh, lots of Bay Area hip-hop.

22:18.539 --> 22:20.039
Like underground stuff.

22:20.041 --> 22:21.439
How did you get into that?

22:21.441 --> 22:23.909
Well, I liked photography
in high school

22:23.911 --> 22:26.912
and then I was lucky enough
to get my hands on a camera,

22:26.914 --> 22:29.615
so I started filming my
friends skateboarding and shit.

22:29.617 --> 22:32.718
Editing that with some music,
and I put it online

22:32.720 --> 22:33.919
and it took off from there.

22:33.921 --> 22:35.020
That's so cool.

22:35.022 --> 22:36.755
Uh, um...

22:36.757 --> 22:39.191
I keep saying cool,
like a jackass.

22:39.193 --> 22:42.728
Uh, but it is, like,
really cool and interesting.

22:42.730 --> 22:45.130
I wish I was that accomplished.

22:45.132 --> 22:48.636
It is cool, I guess.
What do you wanna do?

22:49.837 --> 22:51.973
- With, like, my life?
- Yeah.

22:53.207 --> 22:54.842
I have no idea.

22:55.843 --> 22:57.912
What do you love?

23:01.148 --> 23:02.748
I don't know.

23:02.750 --> 23:04.583
Every time I feel like
I get into something,

23:04.585 --> 23:06.484
it's really easy for me
to lose interest.

23:06.486 --> 23:08.486
Like, what's the point,
you know?

23:08.488 --> 23:09.757
Mmm-hmm.

23:11.491 --> 23:13.692
Like, a complete
anhedonia sometimes.

23:13.694 --> 23:16.797
Whoo! Dropping expensive words
on me.

23:17.665 --> 23:19.800
No, but I get
what you mean though.

23:23.137 --> 23:25.971
I think I'd like to work
with people in some way, though.

23:25.973 --> 23:27.740
Like a social worker?

23:27.742 --> 23:32.511
Maybe more just helping people
through tough shit.

23:32.513 --> 23:34.115
Whatever job that is.

23:41.122 --> 23:43.658
So, why are you sitting
so far away?

23:50.197 --> 23:52.264
I didn't want
to just show you the roof.

23:52.266 --> 23:54.635
I hope that's not a bad thing.

23:56.270 --> 23:57.872
No, um...

23:58.806 --> 24:00.039
No, I guess I'm just nervous.

24:00.041 --> 24:03.443
Too nervous to
scoot over here a little bit?

24:07.214 --> 24:08.516
No.

24:28.903 --> 24:30.004
Shit.

24:39.714 --> 24:42.717
What a shame.
I thought you'd be ready.

24:44.585 --> 24:45.684
I, uh...

24:45.686 --> 24:47.822
I guess you're just
gonna have to watch first.

25:23.824 --> 25:24.992
What the fuck, man?

25:28.796 --> 25:31.096
What the fuck? Jimmy!

25:31.098 --> 25:32.533
Jimmy! Jimmy, come on, man!

25:34.635 --> 25:35.903
Jimmy, come on, man!

25:37.271 --> 25:39.605
Come on! Got to wake up, dude!

25:39.607 --> 25:41.108
Jimmy is dead as fuck, yo.

25:42.176 --> 25:43.911
What the fuck did you just do?

25:45.746 --> 25:48.113
I drank his blood.

25:48.115 --> 25:50.716
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

25:50.718 --> 25:52.317
Poor Jimmy.

25:52.319 --> 25:54.655
His only mistake was
keeping shitty company.

25:55.289 --> 25:56.957
You, on the other hand...

25:58.993 --> 26:00.859
That thing that you did.

26:00.861 --> 26:02.828
The thing that you hoped that
no one would find about,

26:02.830 --> 26:04.863
the thing you thought
you got away with,

26:04.865 --> 26:06.567
it's precisely why you're here.

26:07.401 --> 26:08.602
What?

26:10.004 --> 26:11.639
Do you want me
to say her name?

26:13.674 --> 26:15.808
How do you know that?

26:15.810 --> 26:18.712
My super sexy
vampire power, silly.

26:20.347 --> 26:22.214
It's Claire, by the way.

26:22.216 --> 26:24.783
Unless you thought
it was a lucky guess.

26:24.785 --> 26:27.119
What the hell is going on?

26:27.121 --> 26:30.155
You know, I really wouldn't
sweat the details, Todd.

26:30.157 --> 26:32.357
So right now you got exactly
the length of this cigarette

26:32.359 --> 26:36.095
to come to terms with the fact
that for once in your life,

26:36.097 --> 26:38.099
it's just not gonna
work out for you.

26:50.845 --> 26:53.278
Not a lot of stars.

26:53.280 --> 26:56.014
That's the one good thing
about where I come from.

26:56.016 --> 26:58.152
You can see the whole damn
Milky Way at night.

27:00.054 --> 27:01.222
You hungry at all?

27:04.091 --> 27:05.691
My first night in LA,

27:05.693 --> 27:07.228
and it's already
the best night of my life.

27:08.996 --> 27:10.429
I'm not trying to be weird.

27:10.431 --> 27:12.931
God, I hope that didn't sound
too dramatic.

27:12.933 --> 27:14.466
No.

27:14.468 --> 27:17.236
But if we can make it
more special,

27:17.238 --> 27:20.005
if you had one night here,
one night only,

27:20.007 --> 27:21.375
what else would you wanna do?

27:23.210 --> 27:26.912
Probably wanna see
the sunrise at the ocean.

27:26.914 --> 27:29.915
The sun sets in the west.
It doesn't rise.

27:29.917 --> 27:33.387
- Fuck.
- But we can still go.

27:35.456 --> 27:38.993
So, not to sound all emo,

27:39.561 --> 27:41.729
but can I see you again?

27:45.466 --> 27:48.867
I think this is more just
like a one-night thing.

27:48.869 --> 27:50.169
Oh...

27:50.171 --> 27:52.873
- I'm sorry.
- No, no. Um...

27:56.043 --> 27:58.110
It has nothing to do with you.

27:58.112 --> 28:00.179
It's fine.
You don't have to explain yourself.

28:00.181 --> 28:02.049
It's not the first time...

28:04.151 --> 28:05.753
...you know...

28:32.479 --> 28:33.914
That's enough.

28:46.493 --> 28:48.128
I like this one.

28:50.164 --> 28:52.433
She reminds me
of somebody I used to know.

28:56.036 --> 28:58.038
In case
you haven't figured it out...

29:04.979 --> 29:08.280
Shoveled a lot of shit
in your life, haven't you?

29:08.282 --> 29:11.085
How would you like to hold the
keys to the kingdom for a change?

29:13.387 --> 29:15.521
Do you know
what it is I'm asking?

29:15.523 --> 29:18.524
Duke, are you sure?

29:18.526 --> 29:20.828
Why don't we give you
some time to think about it?

29:21.996 --> 29:23.130
If you survive.

29:28.002 --> 29:29.136
Shit.

31:10.938 --> 31:12.505
Laurel, where the fuck
have you been?

31:12.507 --> 31:14.005
I've been calling you all night.

31:14.007 --> 31:16.308
And you still
haven't called Mom by the...

31:16.310 --> 31:17.510
Jesus fucking Christ,
what happened?

31:17.512 --> 31:19.044
Nothing.

31:19.046 --> 31:20.948
- Did somebody do this to you?
- No.

31:21.716 --> 31:24.650
- Laurel.
- I'm fine.

31:24.652 --> 31:27.087
- It's just, stupid...
- What?

31:28.021 --> 31:31.223
- I fell.
- What?

31:31.225 --> 31:34.493
I was drunk
and I didn't sleep enough

31:34.495 --> 31:36.428
and I fell.

31:36.430 --> 31:38.564
I woke up, everyone was gone.

31:38.566 --> 31:41.569
- You fell?
- I fell, Mark.

31:51.378 --> 31:53.180
Wait, your friends
just up and bailed on you?

31:54.582 --> 31:55.983
I guess.

31:57.217 --> 31:59.351
Probably didn't know what to do

31:59.353 --> 32:00.487
and booked it.

32:01.656 --> 32:03.323
Why the fuck didn't you call me?

32:04.425 --> 32:07.125
Because I smashed my phone.

32:07.127 --> 32:08.226
Well, that's fucking great.

32:08.228 --> 32:09.697
Please don't tell Mom.

32:18.005 --> 32:19.707
Hey, do I need to take you
to the hospital?

32:21.074 --> 32:24.044
Mmm-mmm. I just need to rest.

32:25.647 --> 32:27.247
You wanna take my bed?

32:27.782 --> 32:30.716
No, I'm just

32:30.718 --> 32:33.353
gonna pass out right here,
if that's all right.

32:36.558 --> 32:38.524
Could you close
the blinds though?

32:38.526 --> 32:40.060
It's fucking bright in here.

32:41.763 --> 32:43.665
Hey, you gotta do me
a favor, though.

32:44.298 --> 32:46.064
Call Mom.

32:46.066 --> 32:48.202
Tell her you dropped your phone
in the toilet or something.

32:49.169 --> 32:50.971
- Okay?
- Mmm-hmm.

33:25.439 --> 33:27.709
- What time is it?
- 7:00.

33:28.308 --> 33:29.376
Oh.

33:30.244 --> 33:32.580
It feels like
I've been asleep forever.

33:33.380 --> 33:34.582
It's Sunday.

33:36.483 --> 33:37.619
Holy shit.

33:39.721 --> 33:41.288
You hungry?

33:42.824 --> 33:45.156
Not really.

33:45.158 --> 33:46.794
You should
eat something anyway.

33:58.372 --> 34:00.773
You know what? I'm okay.

34:00.775 --> 34:02.276
Just eat it.

34:19.793 --> 34:22.262
Whoa! Hey!

34:28.636 --> 34:31.103
Lolo, you okay in there?

34:34.876 --> 34:36.376
What's going on with you?

34:37.911 --> 34:39.512
Jesus.

34:39.514 --> 34:41.813
You sure you don't need
to go to the hospital?

34:41.815 --> 34:44.686
No. I'm fine.

34:46.286 --> 34:48.155
- Laurel.
- I'm fine!

35:00.902 --> 35:02.202
Okay.

35:18.720 --> 35:20.420
Ah.

36:48.275 --> 36:49.476
Fuck.

36:53.848 --> 36:55.848
Hi, can I help you guys
with something?

36:55.850 --> 36:57.550
Is Laurel home?

36:57.552 --> 36:59.051
It's a bit late.

36:59.053 --> 37:00.420
Is it?

37:04.759 --> 37:06.794
Are you gonna
let us in or what?

37:07.995 --> 37:09.429
Yeah, sure.

37:11.632 --> 37:12.633
Hey, kid.

37:14.769 --> 37:17.004
- Nice boxers.
- Yeah, thanks.

37:20.641 --> 37:21.909
How are you feeling?

37:23.878 --> 37:25.578
I'm fine.

37:25.580 --> 37:27.515
You were supposed to
meet us, remember?

37:28.816 --> 37:31.382
Yeah, sorry about that.

37:31.384 --> 37:32.885
Sorry about the other night.

37:32.887 --> 37:34.053
I'm glad you're okay.

37:34.055 --> 37:35.554
Whoa, whoa, wait.

37:35.556 --> 37:37.792
Are these the fucking assholes
who ditched you?

37:42.964 --> 37:44.832
No, they're not.

37:46.399 --> 37:48.768
Thought we'd stop by
and see if you're still down.

37:48.770 --> 37:51.637
Glad we found the place.
You weren't answering your phone.

37:51.639 --> 37:54.405
Okay, why's everyone
talking so cryptically?

37:54.407 --> 37:56.677
And why's she sorry
about the other night?

37:57.712 --> 38:00.012
Mark, can you just...

38:00.014 --> 38:01.580
Can you just go
put on some pants?

38:01.582 --> 38:02.984
He's fine the way he is.

38:03.951 --> 38:05.718
Oh, how fucking rude of me

38:05.720 --> 38:07.485
to be in my living room
in boxers

38:07.487 --> 38:09.755
at, the middle
of the fucking night?

38:09.757 --> 38:11.291
Mark!

38:15.930 --> 38:17.064
Okay.

38:20.067 --> 38:22.902
Yeah, just, um...

38:22.904 --> 38:24.605
Just give me a second
to get ready.

38:24.939 --> 38:26.007
Okay.

38:37.518 --> 38:39.685
- So, are you guys like...
- Vampires?

38:39.687 --> 38:40.755
Yup.

38:43.958 --> 38:45.858
Am I a vampire now?

38:45.860 --> 38:47.726
Do you wanna be?

38:47.728 --> 38:48.930
I don't know.

38:51.098 --> 38:53.032
Can vampires get drunk?

38:53.034 --> 38:55.102
Bitch, you can get
as lit as you want.

39:02.442 --> 39:03.878
Were you gonna kill me?

39:06.413 --> 39:07.615
Does that scare you?

39:08.583 --> 39:09.784
Not really.

39:10.585 --> 39:11.586
Why not?

39:14.487 --> 39:16.858
My life's already kind of
been like a horror movie.

39:17.892 --> 39:19.861
Most of it. So...

39:23.064 --> 39:24.532
Fuck it.

39:47.755 --> 39:50.591
Careful, that's the last one.

39:52.026 --> 39:53.192
What is it?

39:53.194 --> 39:54.727
The cure.

39:54.729 --> 39:55.995
If you take it
before you feed,

39:55.997 --> 39:57.632
you'll turn back
into your old self.

40:00.668 --> 40:02.637
Now would be the time
for any questions.

40:03.938 --> 40:05.571
Do you guys kill people?

40:05.573 --> 40:06.607
Indiscriminately.

40:07.842 --> 40:09.143
Innocent people?

40:10.044 --> 40:12.077
Say it's like 80/20.

40:12.079 --> 40:14.513
You know, we try
to target the trolls,

40:14.515 --> 40:16.916
the privileged and their
apathetic trust fund kids,

40:16.918 --> 40:20.152
but we're not a movement.

40:20.154 --> 40:21.956
We're a terrorist
organization, at best.

40:24.025 --> 40:25.760
So, you were gonna kill me.

40:26.694 --> 40:27.862
Yes.

40:29.196 --> 40:31.030
Why?

40:31.032 --> 40:33.100
People you're attracted to
taste better.

40:35.169 --> 40:36.804
I don't wanna kill people.

40:37.605 --> 40:38.804
Too bad.

40:38.806 --> 40:40.207
Knock it off.

40:42.877 --> 40:45.177
The world's a meatgrinder, kid.

40:45.179 --> 40:46.679
Especially if you're a woman.

40:46.681 --> 40:49.848
I don't think you need a Power Point
presentation to know that one's true.

40:49.850 --> 40:53.919
We're politically, socially,
and mythologically fucked.

40:53.921 --> 40:56.021
Our roles are secondary.

40:56.023 --> 41:00.059
Our body's suspect,
alien, other.

41:00.061 --> 41:03.862
We're made to be monsters,
so let's be monsters.

41:03.864 --> 41:06.065
Let's be gods.

41:06.067 --> 41:09.902
What we offer here is not
the chance to join a group,

41:09.904 --> 41:12.472
but the chance to
truly be an individual.

41:15.643 --> 41:17.078
That's the pitch.

41:23.617 --> 41:24.817
What about my family?

41:24.819 --> 41:26.151
What about them?

41:26.153 --> 41:28.456
Izzy directs music videos and
visits her brother all the time.

41:30.124 --> 41:32.992
Frog does tattoos out of her
dad's shop in Eagle Rock.

41:32.994 --> 41:34.061
And Roya...

41:34.829 --> 41:35.894
has a cat.

41:35.896 --> 41:37.763
Mister Kitty.

41:37.765 --> 41:39.499
We stick together
because we want to.

41:40.167 --> 41:42.001
Because it's safer.

41:42.003 --> 41:43.702
But you can do
whatever you want,

41:43.704 --> 41:45.804
just don't break the rules.

41:45.806 --> 41:47.606
All right, what are the rules?

41:47.608 --> 41:48.907
Glad you asked.

41:48.909 --> 41:50.209
The first rule of Bite Club...

41:50.211 --> 41:51.577
Bite Club?

41:51.579 --> 41:52.913
Juggalos was taken.

41:53.881 --> 41:55.247
We don't actually have a name.

41:55.249 --> 41:57.149
I just... I was trying
to sound cool.

41:57.151 --> 41:58.250
What about Bit Girls?

41:58.252 --> 42:00.319
Nah, sounds like we're
part of STEM or something.

42:00.321 --> 42:01.822
Anyway...

42:03.057 --> 42:05.124
Rule number one,

42:05.126 --> 42:07.760
you never glamour
another vampire.

42:07.762 --> 42:09.361
Okay? You never
invade their minds

42:09.363 --> 42:10.598
to affect their decisions.

42:12.700 --> 42:13.901
Rule number two.

42:14.835 --> 42:15.903
You kill what you eat.

42:16.871 --> 42:18.037
Otherwise it turns,

42:18.039 --> 42:20.606
and we're not ready for
that kind of expansion yet.

42:20.608 --> 42:22.975
All potential recruits are decided by
me, and me alone,

42:22.977 --> 42:24.278
but we all have veto power.

42:26.213 --> 42:30.017
Which brings me to our final,
and most important rule.

42:31.919 --> 42:34.021
You never, ever, turn a man.

42:35.056 --> 42:36.323
It's off limits.

42:37.191 --> 42:39.391
Men can't handle power.

42:39.393 --> 42:41.695
They have it already and look
at what they've done with it.

42:44.732 --> 42:45.833
What about me?

42:47.935 --> 42:49.737
Never crossed my mind.

42:56.377 --> 42:58.911
So, what do you say, ladies?

42:58.913 --> 43:01.816
All those in favor of Laurel
joining the V-Squad.

43:02.817 --> 43:03.884
Yup.

43:04.251 --> 43:05.252
Yeah.

43:08.789 --> 43:09.924
All right.

43:11.392 --> 43:12.660
K.

43:34.782 --> 43:38.050
This is Jacob.

43:38.052 --> 43:39.885
When Jacob isn't listening
to Joe Rogan

43:39.887 --> 43:42.955
prat along about ayahuasca,
he's on Twitter

43:42.957 --> 43:45.224
under the user name,
shitlordshaman89

43:45.226 --> 43:46.358
where he tells young women

43:46.360 --> 43:48.827
they deserve to be
raped to death.

43:48.829 --> 43:51.296
He also spends his time
growing conspiracy molds

43:51.298 --> 43:54.233
about the deep state and the
vile petri dish of subreddits

43:54.235 --> 43:56.168
with other
like-minded fucksticks.

43:56.170 --> 43:58.904
However,
one of these conspiracies

43:58.906 --> 44:01.273
involves the idea
that there's a secret cabal

44:01.275 --> 44:04.309
of female vampires
that stalk Los Angeles.

44:04.311 --> 44:06.347
Broken clocks, am I right?

44:07.381 --> 44:09.748
So, Jacob and his buddies,

44:09.750 --> 44:11.183
they get together
and they share stories

44:11.185 --> 44:13.018
and they fancy themselves
vampire hunters.

44:13.020 --> 44:15.053
Don't you, Jacob?

44:15.055 --> 44:16.390
Don't you, Jacob?

44:18.425 --> 44:21.793
Luckily for us,
Jacob is also on Tinder

44:21.795 --> 44:24.429
where he goes by his full
name, Jacob Oflinger,

44:24.431 --> 44:26.832
and, yes, he's posing
with a fish he caught.

44:26.834 --> 44:31.504
He describes himself as
old-fashioned and a bit fashy.

44:31.506 --> 44:33.939
All it took Frog was a few
choice photos to lure him out

44:33.941 --> 44:35.409
of whatever baby cave
he was holed up in.

44:40.247 --> 44:42.247
Crunch time, kid.

44:42.249 --> 44:43.982
This is the part
where you take the red pill

44:43.984 --> 44:45.350
and kick it in wonderland,

44:45.352 --> 44:47.388
or go back home to Kansas.

45:00.100 --> 45:01.168
That's it.

45:04.371 --> 45:06.373
You're nothing but a cat
with its prey.

45:15.382 --> 45:16.383
Do it!

45:19.554 --> 45:21.755
I'm sorry. I can't.

45:22.256 --> 45:23.390
I can't do it.

45:26.460 --> 45:28.160
No. You just need more time.

45:28.162 --> 45:30.028
Duke, what are you doing?
Let go of me.

45:30.030 --> 45:31.332
- Duke!
- Let go!

45:32.933 --> 45:35.000
- She's made up her mind.
- I know what I'm doing.

45:35.002 --> 45:36.868
Let me go! Help!

45:36.870 --> 45:40.272
- Let her go.
- Help me! Help!

45:40.274 --> 45:41.909
Help!

45:49.350 --> 45:50.550
What do we do now?

45:50.552 --> 45:52.417
- Nothing.
- What?

45:52.419 --> 45:53.954
We let her go.

45:54.556 --> 45:56.991
She'll learn. She'll feed.

45:58.959 --> 46:00.227
As for you...

46:18.212 --> 46:19.378
What's so fucking funny?

46:19.380 --> 46:21.081
We got you bitches in hell.

47:23.444 --> 47:25.143
What are you doing, man?
Fucking waste 'em.

47:25.145 --> 47:26.211
Yeah, hurry the fuck up!

47:26.213 --> 47:27.214
Come on.

47:28.949 --> 47:29.950
Ahhh!

47:32.654 --> 47:34.121
Not so fucking fast.

47:37.191 --> 47:38.524
You'll put...

47:38.526 --> 47:39.925
the flamethrower...

47:39.927 --> 47:40.994
down.

47:42.463 --> 47:43.629
Your mental bullshit

47:43.631 --> 47:46.198
ain't gonna work on me,
snowflake.

47:46.200 --> 47:47.600
I'm linked to the master.

47:47.602 --> 47:49.334
I want the code...

47:49.336 --> 47:50.402
to the vault.

47:50.404 --> 47:51.405
Go fuck yourself.

47:52.306 --> 47:53.405
Ahhh!

47:54.441 --> 47:57.109
Smoke me, motherfucker!
I'm not giving you shit.

47:57.111 --> 47:58.310
You don't understand.

47:58.312 --> 47:59.579
He promised me.

47:59.581 --> 48:01.012
He promised.

48:01.014 --> 48:02.582
So, if you want
your little friend to live

48:02.584 --> 48:03.649
you will release him!

48:03.651 --> 48:05.551
I will never release him.

48:05.553 --> 48:07.419
I could give two shits
and a fuck what you'll do.

48:07.421 --> 48:08.353
Even if I did,

48:08.355 --> 48:10.088
he wouldn't give you what
you wanted anyway.

48:10.090 --> 48:12.090
Release him! God damn it!

48:12.092 --> 48:13.659
Or else I'll barbeque
all of you.

48:13.661 --> 48:15.661
- Do it.
- Release him now.

48:50.665 --> 48:51.666
Argh!

49:20.394 --> 49:22.628
I'd ask how you were doing,
but...

49:22.630 --> 49:24.597
frankly, you seem
to be doing pretty well.

49:24.599 --> 49:26.331
All things considered.

49:28.068 --> 49:29.169
How is she?

49:29.737 --> 49:30.738
Frog?

49:32.139 --> 49:33.140
She'll live.

49:35.175 --> 49:36.176
You?

49:40.113 --> 49:42.249
Did you come up here
to give me a speech?

49:43.183 --> 49:44.351
Don't flatter yourself.

49:45.753 --> 49:47.054
This is my thinking roof.

49:52.827 --> 49:54.061
What was all that?

49:55.730 --> 49:57.530
Maybe not right now, all right?

49:57.532 --> 49:59.032
No, fuck that.
I wanna know everything.

50:00.400 --> 50:01.401
You owe me that.

50:03.203 --> 50:04.204
I guess I do.

50:08.643 --> 50:11.211
Part of the reason we stick
together is because we have to.

50:13.815 --> 50:15.148
Those two young guys...

50:16.316 --> 50:17.417
were vampire hunters.

50:20.120 --> 50:21.255
That old man...

50:23.123 --> 50:24.391
he was a Familiar.

50:26.528 --> 50:28.295
Something that vampires
used to have.

50:28.696 --> 50:30.262
Well...

50:30.264 --> 50:32.397
one vampire used to have.

50:32.399 --> 50:34.101
Someone to do
his dirty laundry.

50:34.702 --> 50:36.201
Literally,

50:36.203 --> 50:37.737
his dirty laundry,

50:37.739 --> 50:40.472
file his taxes, whatever.

50:40.474 --> 50:43.176
In exchange for the promise that
one day he would turn them.

50:44.812 --> 50:46.079
But he would never turn them.

50:49.283 --> 50:50.284
Who was he?

50:53.320 --> 50:54.321
Vlad...

50:55.757 --> 50:56.758
Manfred...

50:58.225 --> 50:59.326
Castaneda.

51:01.261 --> 51:02.427
The Master.

51:13.440 --> 51:14.441
And?

51:15.877 --> 51:17.077
I'm getting there.

51:21.683 --> 51:23.618
In this world, it takes
a tremendous...

51:24.619 --> 51:26.384
amount of guts,

51:26.386 --> 51:29.154
for some people to merely exist.

51:29.156 --> 51:32.223
Much less,
be who they truly are.

51:32.225 --> 51:35.493
And back when I was a little
bit younger than you are now...

51:35.495 --> 51:38.165
to be who I wanted to be,
I had to run away from home.

51:40.702 --> 51:43.136
I won't bother you with
what fucking farm I came from.

51:43.871 --> 51:46.171
But when I was 15...

51:46.173 --> 51:48.275
I knew exactly where
I had to get to.

51:49.677 --> 51:51.144
<i>New York City.</i>

52:03.691 --> 52:05.292
<i>But this was New York
in the '70s.</i>

52:06.293 --> 52:07.627
<i>A shithole.</i>

52:09.797 --> 52:12.297
<i>And I didn't have a dime
to my name or a pot to piss in.</i>

52:12.299 --> 52:13.433
<i>But I didn't care.</i>

52:14.636 --> 52:16.267
<i>Because I was free.</i>

52:23.210 --> 52:25.711
<i>So I did what I had to do.</i>

52:29.951 --> 52:31.416
<i>Whatever I had to do.</i>

52:39.226 --> 52:40.227
<i>And I fought...</i>

52:42.429 --> 52:43.698
<i>and I scraped.</i>

52:50.270 --> 52:52.004
<i>And I learned how to survive.</i>

52:59.013 --> 53:00.447
<i>Until finally...</i>

53:06.921 --> 53:08.455
<i>I learned how to thrive.</i>

53:10.658 --> 53:12.892
<i>I'd found my home.</i>

53:12.894 --> 53:14.560
<i>And I'd even found my people.</i>

53:20.367 --> 53:22.935
<i>I was exactly who I
wanted to be.</i>

53:26.040 --> 53:27.307
<i>And nobody...</i>

53:29.010 --> 53:30.511
<i>I mean nobody...</i>

53:31.445 --> 53:33.246
<i>was ever going to take
that away from me.</i>

53:43.057 --> 53:44.757
<i>And that's when I met him.</i>

53:48.495 --> 53:49.564
<i>He was beautiful.</i>

53:50.565 --> 53:51.666
<i>Magnificent.</i>

53:53.300 --> 53:54.602
<i>Like an archangel.</i>

53:56.369 --> 53:57.638
<i>I was mesmerized.</i>

53:58.773 --> 54:00.541
<i>But I knew that
couldn't be right.</i>

54:02.744 --> 54:06.311
<i>I mean, I'm a full-blown,
fucking dyke.</i>

54:06.313 --> 54:08.381
<i>And here I was
drooling over this...</i>

54:08.850 --> 54:09.851
<i>man.</i>

54:12.319 --> 54:13.588
<i>I couldn't help myself.</i>

54:18.492 --> 54:19.660
<i>Because I wasn't really me.</i>

54:23.064 --> 54:24.431
<i>I was a slave.</i>

54:26.466 --> 54:27.769
<i>I was one of his brides.</i>

54:29.804 --> 54:31.572
<i>There to serve
his every depravity.</i>

54:33.406 --> 54:34.909
<i>And it was like that...</i>

54:36.409 --> 54:37.444
<i>for decades.</i>

54:43.483 --> 54:44.819
<i>It was like being trapped
inside myself.</i>

54:46.721 --> 54:49.289
<i>I was aware of who I was,
who I used to be.</i>

54:51.626 --> 54:53.460
<i>But I could do nothing
about it.</i>

54:56.030 --> 54:57.031
<i>He could shapeshift.</i>

55:00.433 --> 55:01.569
<i>Turn to mist.</i>

55:06.140 --> 55:08.009
<i>I don't know exactly,
how old he was.</i>

55:09.010 --> 55:10.477
<i>But we're talking centuries.</i>

55:12.412 --> 55:14.882
<i>And when you live that long,
the days turn to hours.</i>

55:16.017 --> 55:17.752
<i>Decades in to evenings.</i>

55:19.554 --> 55:20.822
<i>When you can never OD.</i>

55:21.689 --> 55:22.690
<i>When you can never...</i>

55:23.291 --> 55:24.892
<i>be hungover or get sick.</i>

55:28.763 --> 55:30.865
<i>The only thing you can
become addicted to...</i>

55:32.099 --> 55:33.501
<i>is the lifestyle.</i>

55:38.172 --> 55:39.574
<i>He started losing his grip.</i>

56:01.562 --> 56:02.964
<i>And that's when I took my shot.</i>

56:15.910 --> 56:17.543
<i>She was the first bride.</i>

56:17.545 --> 56:19.013
<i>The oldest and strongest of us.</i>

56:20.815 --> 56:23.082
<i>He'd saved her from some
14th century mud hut</i>

56:23.084 --> 56:24.950
<i>where her dad and uncles
fucked the goat</i>

56:24.952 --> 56:26.587
<i>when they were too drunk
to bother with her.</i>

56:29.523 --> 56:30.890
<i>But she truly loved him.</i>

56:30.892 --> 56:32.126
<i>But she knew I was right.</i>

56:33.628 --> 56:34.896
<i>His heart refused to burn...</i>

56:36.898 --> 56:38.065
<i>so I locked it away.</i>

56:40.034 --> 56:41.068
<i>And consume him...</i>

56:42.069 --> 56:43.070
<i>piece by piece.</i>

56:52.713 --> 56:53.714
Why do you do that?

56:56.083 --> 56:57.852
Because it gives me
a taste of his power.

57:00.521 --> 57:02.056
It makes him my fucking slave.

57:03.925 --> 57:05.126
So, why not just eat the heart?

57:06.894 --> 57:07.895
I can't.

57:10.164 --> 57:12.867
Whenever I take from him I can
feel him kicking around in my head.

57:15.002 --> 57:17.038
I'm afraid of what will happen
if I take too much.

57:20.174 --> 57:22.176
So that's why we never glamour
another vampire.

57:24.645 --> 57:26.781
And why no man will ever be
a vampire again.

57:29.250 --> 57:30.549
Make no mistake,

57:30.551 --> 57:32.618
given enough time
and the chance,

57:32.620 --> 57:34.887
they would all do what he did.

57:34.889 --> 57:35.923
If they had the power to.

57:38.092 --> 57:39.694
If they knew they wouldn't
be held accountable.

57:43.698 --> 57:44.699
Tell me I'm wrong.

57:47.902 --> 57:49.236
I don't know that I can.

57:54.608 --> 57:56.811
I picture a world where
every woman is a vampire.

57:59.714 --> 58:02.149
Let men be the ones who are
afraid to fucking jog at night.

58:06.887 --> 58:07.888
Hey.

58:09.256 --> 58:10.257
Wanna see something cool?

58:12.660 --> 58:14.261
I don't know how much more
I can take tonight.

58:16.797 --> 58:17.798
No.

58:18.332 --> 58:19.633
This you'll like.

58:20.768 --> 58:21.869
This everyone likes.

58:24.071 --> 58:25.072
Take my hand.

58:29.310 --> 58:30.511
Okay.

58:36.617 --> 58:37.618
Think happy thoughts.

58:38.285 --> 58:39.553
Oh, shit.

58:47.828 --> 58:48.829
Trust me.

59:04.178 --> 59:06.847
Focus on your stomach
and try to pull me in to you.

59:23.831 --> 59:25.764
- Whoa, slow down.
- I can't.

59:35.076 --> 59:37.711
Holy shit, I can fucking fly.

59:38.279 --> 59:40.112
You now know kung fu too.

59:40.114 --> 59:41.749
- Really?
- No.

59:43.384 --> 59:45.719
This is fucking amazing!

59:48.389 --> 59:50.889
All right, all right, Jesus.

59:50.891 --> 59:54.693
You know what? Let's get out of the sky before
someone sees us and we end up on the news.

59:54.695 --> 59:56.297
I have to ask you
something else first.

59:56.997 --> 59:58.664
Shoot.

59:58.666 --> 59:59.667
It's about the first bride.

01:00:01.135 --> 01:00:02.136
What about her?

01:00:11.278 --> 01:00:13.846
That usually doesn't happen
so fast.

01:00:13.848 --> 01:00:16.248
I cannot fucking believe it.

01:00:16.250 --> 01:00:18.152
I'm a goddamn vampire!

01:00:18.752 --> 01:00:19.918
I know,

01:00:19.920 --> 01:00:22.387
but we can't stay here
much longer.

01:00:22.389 --> 01:00:24.593
- We must leave here now.
- Oh, okay.

01:00:30.431 --> 01:00:31.799
Thank you, for this.

01:00:32.399 --> 01:00:33.400
Thank you.

01:00:35.169 --> 01:00:36.401
I love you.

01:00:36.403 --> 01:00:37.404
I love you too.

01:00:40.774 --> 01:00:41.940
Duke, no.

01:00:55.990 --> 01:00:58.090
This is the hole.

01:00:58.092 --> 01:00:59.660
This is where you go
if you break the rules.

01:01:00.494 --> 01:01:01.829
Which one did she break?

01:01:02.963 --> 01:01:03.964
The important one.

01:01:05.299 --> 01:01:08.300
So, how was she...

01:01:08.302 --> 01:01:10.269
The only thing that can kill
a vampire...

01:01:10.271 --> 01:01:11.803
is fire.

01:01:18.078 --> 01:01:19.346
And you have to burn the heart.

01:01:26.120 --> 01:01:27.986
How long is she
going to be down there?

01:01:27.988 --> 01:01:29.290
As long as it takes.

01:01:30.891 --> 01:01:32.226
And she's all alone?

01:01:33.294 --> 01:01:34.862
Can you imagine?

01:01:37.532 --> 01:01:38.732
No.

01:01:39.333 --> 01:01:40.334
Good.

01:01:41.368 --> 01:01:42.369
So don't fuck up.

01:01:52.514 --> 01:01:53.714
So, uh...

01:01:54.014 --> 01:01:55.080
you...

01:01:55.082 --> 01:01:56.784
trying to go home tonight?

01:02:29.450 --> 01:02:30.451
What's with you?

01:02:31.586 --> 01:02:32.786
Are you kidding?

01:02:35.590 --> 01:02:36.790
It's too easy.

01:02:38.459 --> 01:02:39.891
So?

01:02:39.893 --> 01:02:41.161
So that's the problem.

01:02:42.396 --> 01:02:43.397
It's not me.

01:02:43.998 --> 01:02:45.063
Um...

01:02:45.065 --> 01:02:46.066
I don't think it is.

01:02:48.869 --> 01:02:50.237
I don't know. How do you do it?

01:02:50.605 --> 01:02:51.805
I just do.

01:02:57.244 --> 01:02:58.812
I mean, you were going
to do it to me.

01:03:00.615 --> 01:03:01.815
Glad I didn't.

01:03:02.216 --> 01:03:03.516
I'm serious.

01:03:05.486 --> 01:03:07.419
You're still hung up
on that shit?

01:03:07.421 --> 01:03:08.621
You know...

01:03:08.623 --> 01:03:10.291
Maybe, I don't want
it to be easy.

01:03:14.428 --> 01:03:15.429
Were you given a choice?

01:03:16.030 --> 01:03:17.031
Yeah.

01:03:18.198 --> 01:03:19.433
Why did you do it?

01:03:21.636 --> 01:03:22.836
You don't know?

01:03:24.271 --> 01:03:26.271
Agency, I guess?

01:03:26.273 --> 01:03:28.175
Kicks? I mean,
I don't really think about it.

01:03:30.110 --> 01:03:31.111
That's the other thing.

01:03:32.880 --> 01:03:35.316
I get we don't age,
that we stay the same, but...

01:03:37.151 --> 01:03:39.053
what if people start
asking questions?

01:03:40.154 --> 01:03:42.287
Yeah, I mean,
you got a few years.

01:03:42.289 --> 01:03:43.591
People just think
you're aging well.

01:03:45.492 --> 01:03:49.562
Christ, I'm going to be
18 forever.

01:03:49.564 --> 01:03:53.499
There are worse fates,
than eternal youth and glamour.

01:03:53.501 --> 01:03:56.170
In fact, I'm pretty sure that's why
Frog signed up in the first place.

01:03:58.972 --> 01:03:59.973
Just think on it like this,

01:04:00.874 --> 01:04:03.275
if science and medicine
keep progressing,

01:04:03.277 --> 01:04:06.011
the logical endgame wouldn't
just be to just prolong life

01:04:06.013 --> 01:04:08.380
but to stop death
and preserve youth, so...

01:04:08.382 --> 01:04:09.617
we leapfrogged ahead.

01:04:17.091 --> 01:04:19.157
<i>Lolo, where are you?</i>

01:04:19.159 --> 01:04:21.694
<i>You're ignoring me,
you're ignoring Mom.</i>

01:04:21.696 --> 01:04:24.264
<i>I'm getting calls from Andy 'cause
you won't answer his calls either.</i>

01:04:25.366 --> 01:04:26.367
<i>Call me back.</i>

01:04:32.540 --> 01:04:34.039
<i>Yes, Mom.</i>

01:04:34.041 --> 01:04:36.208
I'm fine, I'm having fun.

01:04:36.210 --> 01:04:38.379
- Well... Bill, say hi to your daughter.
- Hi, honey.

01:04:39.079 --> 01:04:40.080
<i>Hi, Daddy.</i>

01:04:41.949 --> 01:04:43.217
You sound so tired.

01:04:45.119 --> 01:04:45.984
I am.

01:04:45.986 --> 01:04:47.553
<i>Is your brother
being nice to you?</i>

01:04:47.555 --> 01:04:49.488
Yes, Mom.

01:04:49.490 --> 01:04:51.091
We don't have anything to worry
about, do we?

01:04:51.526 --> 01:04:53.024
<i>No.</i>

01:04:53.026 --> 01:04:54.126
I know.

01:04:54.128 --> 01:04:55.195
Yes.

01:04:57.464 --> 01:04:59.333
Hold on a second,
let me grab something.

01:05:07.040 --> 01:05:08.242
Honey, what's up?

01:05:15.750 --> 01:05:16.950
Nothing.

01:05:18.185 --> 01:05:19.186
You promise?

01:05:20.020 --> 01:05:21.453
Yes. I just...

01:05:21.455 --> 01:05:22.755
I haven't gotten a lot of sleep

01:05:22.757 --> 01:05:24.659
the past couple of nights
and I...

01:05:25.627 --> 01:05:26.927
guess it's caught up to me.

01:05:29.463 --> 01:05:31.997
Look, we know you're
experimenting and all and

01:05:31.999 --> 01:05:34.433
we did the same thing
when we were your age, but

01:05:34.435 --> 01:05:36.769
<i>you're staying away from
the hard drugs, right?</i>

01:05:36.771 --> 01:05:38.771
Yes, Mom.

01:05:38.773 --> 01:05:40.107
<i>And you're not drinking
and driving?</i>

01:05:40.542 --> 01:05:42.073
No, Mom.

01:05:42.075 --> 01:05:43.377
You can tell me if something
is wrong.

01:05:44.111 --> 01:05:45.112
You know that?

01:05:45.547 --> 01:05:46.548
I know.

01:05:50.585 --> 01:05:51.751
Okay.

01:05:51.753 --> 01:05:52.953
I'll stop.

01:05:55.623 --> 01:05:56.722
Well, I guess I'll just

01:05:56.724 --> 01:05:58.056
let you go then.

01:05:58.058 --> 01:05:59.625
<i>You know you can come back
home anytime you want, right?</i>

01:05:59.627 --> 01:06:00.628
I know.

01:06:01.629 --> 01:06:02.630
You can.

01:06:04.532 --> 01:06:05.533
All right.

01:06:06.266 --> 01:06:07.332
<i>Love you, honey.</i>

01:06:07.334 --> 01:06:08.335
I love you too, Mom.

01:06:09.303 --> 01:06:11.071
- <i>Bye.</i>
- Bye.

01:06:13.808 --> 01:06:15.240
Hey, you talked to Mom?

01:06:15.242 --> 01:06:16.809
- Yeah.
- Cool.

01:06:16.811 --> 01:06:18.376
Well, guess who I have
here for you?

01:06:18.378 --> 01:06:20.378
It's Andy. He's been trying
to get a hold of you.

01:06:20.380 --> 01:06:21.616
Yo, here she is.
I caught her ass.

01:06:22.617 --> 01:06:24.082
Hey.

01:06:24.084 --> 01:06:25.419
<i>Hey, bitch, why have you
been ducking me?</i>

01:06:26.153 --> 01:06:27.587
Yeah.

01:06:27.589 --> 01:06:29.488
I'm sorry. I really am.

01:06:29.490 --> 01:06:31.058
It's just,
things have been really,

01:06:31.492 --> 01:06:33.358
insane.

01:06:33.360 --> 01:06:36.796
I don't think I would know how
to explain it, even if I could.

01:06:36.798 --> 01:06:38.764
<i>Just do it in person.
Did Mark tell you?</i>

01:06:38.766 --> 01:06:39.732
Tell me what?

01:06:39.734 --> 01:06:41.603
<i>I am going to come
visit you next week.</i>

01:06:42.269 --> 01:06:43.571
<i>Already bought my ticket.</i>

01:06:47.809 --> 01:06:49.009
<i>What?</i>

01:06:51.311 --> 01:06:53.313
I don't know if that's
such a good idea.

01:06:55.717 --> 01:06:56.718
<i>Okay.</i>

01:06:57.652 --> 01:06:58.653
<i>You just...</i>

01:07:00.588 --> 01:07:01.589
<i>Why not?</i>

01:07:02.489 --> 01:07:03.490
It's just...

01:07:04.626 --> 01:07:05.793
I'm going through...

01:07:06.493 --> 01:07:07.793
something.

01:07:07.795 --> 01:07:09.094
<i>So am I.</i>

01:07:09.096 --> 01:07:10.765
I'm sorry, I really am.

01:07:12.399 --> 01:07:15.267
<i>Fucking classic, I knew
this shit was gonna happen.</i>

01:07:15.269 --> 01:07:17.770
Andy, it has nothing
to do with you, I promise.

01:07:17.772 --> 01:07:18.773
It's just...

01:07:22.544 --> 01:07:23.545
Andy?

01:08:16.496 --> 01:08:17.497
Boo.

01:08:35.247 --> 01:08:37.283
Inland fucking empire.

01:08:37.852 --> 01:08:38.951
Ew.

01:08:38.953 --> 01:08:40.153
Of course they'd be here.

01:08:48.563 --> 01:08:49.929
Oh, shit.

01:08:49.930 --> 01:08:52.965
We've prepared for this, everyone stay frosty.

01:08:52.966 --> 01:08:55.433
Right, captain fucking
20 year old.

01:08:55.435 --> 01:08:57.268
Get the chargers
and napalm ready.

01:08:57.270 --> 01:09:00.337
We blow these bitches to kingdom
come, if they step foot in here.

01:09:00.340 --> 01:09:02.374
We know they aren't
impervious to bullets

01:09:02.376 --> 01:09:04.408
and we know fire kills them.

01:09:04.411 --> 01:09:06.444
This is our moment.

01:09:06.446 --> 01:09:07.479
All in.

01:09:07.481 --> 01:09:08.781
I told you, we should
get the fuck out of here.

01:09:08.783 --> 01:09:12.652
Mind your surroundings and stand
tight now, we're safe together.

01:09:20.761 --> 01:09:22.862
Why do they always think
we don't have weapons?

01:09:30.971 --> 01:09:32.203
I gotta go.

01:09:32.205 --> 01:09:34.774
- Wait, you just fucking got here.
- I know, I've got plans.

01:09:34.776 --> 01:09:36.441
Oh... I see.

01:09:36.443 --> 01:09:37.910
Shadows me my whole life,

01:09:37.912 --> 01:09:40.845
steals my taste in music, worships
at my feet but now I'm the lame one.

01:09:40.848 --> 01:09:42.548
Look...

01:09:42.550 --> 01:09:46.952
Oh, no, it's cool, it's cool. I'd be hanging
out at spice world too, if I was you.

01:09:46.953 --> 01:09:48.756
Hey, you sure they wouldn't wanna
just come hang out with us here?

01:09:49.090 --> 01:09:50.589
I'm sure.

01:09:50.591 --> 01:09:51.591
Okay, fine.

01:09:52.593 --> 01:09:53.594
- Love you.
- Yup.

01:09:56.731 --> 01:09:57.732
<i>Call of Duty?</i>

01:09:59.734 --> 01:10:00.833
Your new digs.

01:10:02.103 --> 01:10:03.303
Go nuts.

01:10:04.605 --> 01:10:05.606
Thanks.

01:10:07.340 --> 01:10:08.341
Welcome home.

01:10:10.611 --> 01:10:11.612
What? No coffin?

01:10:14.549 --> 01:10:15.815
Why would we do that?

01:10:15.817 --> 01:10:17.850
Uh, 'cause it's dope.

01:10:30.665 --> 01:10:32.698
Layman.

01:10:32.700 --> 01:10:34.867
Honestly, I don't, I don't
think it could be described

01:10:34.869 --> 01:10:37.572
for the layman. That was...
That was the chemistry...

01:10:40.675 --> 01:10:41.843
Guy's an idiot.

01:10:52.720 --> 01:10:54.486
I wouldn't call myself
a feminist.

01:10:54.488 --> 01:10:56.522
And not because I don't agree,
of course...

01:10:56.524 --> 01:10:57.992
I agree with feminism.

01:11:04.565 --> 01:11:06.599
I just think that by
saying I'm a feminist

01:11:06.601 --> 01:11:07.767
implies that I'm already there.

01:11:07.769 --> 01:11:10.403
That I have the answers and I...
I have done all the work.

01:11:27.588 --> 01:11:30.455
And I don't think honestly a man
can be a feminist.

01:11:30.457 --> 01:11:32.392
Men right now, I think they need
to step out of the way.

01:11:34.427 --> 01:11:36.463
They need to step out of the way
and they need to what?

01:11:37.464 --> 01:11:38.531
Listen.

01:13:08.990 --> 01:13:10.756
You know,
you gonna have to feed.

01:13:25.539 --> 01:13:26.607
Sooner or later.

01:13:38.786 --> 01:13:39.787
You all right?

01:13:41.155 --> 01:13:42.156
I am fine.

01:13:43.057 --> 01:13:44.857
I'm just, uh...

01:13:44.859 --> 01:13:46.394
I'm waiting for my Uber.

01:13:49.830 --> 01:13:51.096
Uh...

01:13:51.098 --> 01:13:52.533
Hey, oh, what's your name?

01:13:54.235 --> 01:13:55.668
Laurel.

01:13:55.670 --> 01:13:57.036
I'm Cici.

01:13:57.038 --> 01:13:58.039
Like two C's...

01:13:58.739 --> 01:13:59.740
C-C together.

01:14:01.676 --> 01:14:02.677
Yeah, I got it.

01:14:04.679 --> 01:14:08.047
Hey, you wouldn't happen
to have a cigarette, would you?

01:14:08.049 --> 01:14:10.983
- Oh, um...
- Um... let me.

01:14:10.985 --> 01:14:12.153
Oh, if you would...

01:14:13.988 --> 01:14:16.456
There we go, I got one.

01:14:19.160 --> 01:14:20.628
- Hmm.
- Here.

01:14:39.146 --> 01:14:40.748
Ah, thank you.

01:14:45.086 --> 01:14:48.120
- Hello.
- Oh, huh. You're welcome.

01:14:48.122 --> 01:14:51.323
- Um... have a good night.
- Yeah, here's your lighter back.

01:14:51.325 --> 01:14:54.061
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:15:01.702 --> 01:15:02.703
- Help!
- Shit!

01:15:02.970 --> 01:15:03.971
Ahhh.

01:15:11.746 --> 01:15:14.313
- What the hell are you doing?
- What are you doing here?

01:15:14.315 --> 01:15:16.081
Making sure you don't do
anything stupid.

01:15:16.083 --> 01:15:18.083
- You are watching me?
- Yeah.

01:15:18.085 --> 01:15:20.119
And good thing I was too.

01:15:20.121 --> 01:15:23.722
I'm so profoundly bored
by your crisis of conscience.

01:15:23.724 --> 01:15:25.624
I'm gonna need you to get
with the fucking program.

01:15:25.626 --> 01:15:26.925
Well, you said I could
do whatever.

01:15:26.927 --> 01:15:28.162
Not if it's going
to get you killed.

01:15:29.163 --> 01:15:31.296
Or better yet, get us killed.

01:15:31.298 --> 01:15:32.698
You wanna be trigger shy?

01:15:32.700 --> 01:15:34.099
Fine.

01:15:34.101 --> 01:15:36.137
The longer you fight the hunger,
the bigger the mistake you'll make.

01:15:36.704 --> 01:15:37.838
Trust me.

01:15:38.105 --> 01:15:39.206
Come on.

01:16:17.178 --> 01:16:18.777
What's going on?

01:16:18.779 --> 01:16:20.014
Andy tried to kill himself.

01:16:20.714 --> 01:16:22.214
What?

01:16:22.216 --> 01:16:23.751
He swallowed
a bottle of aspirin.

01:16:24.218 --> 01:16:25.751
He's not dead.

01:16:25.753 --> 01:16:28.856
His liver is fucked and he's in
intensive care, but he's gonna be fine.

01:16:30.791 --> 01:16:31.926
He left a note, I guess.

01:16:32.561 --> 01:16:33.828
No idea what it says, but...

01:16:35.696 --> 01:16:36.862
Yeah.

01:16:36.864 --> 01:16:38.330
I'm sorry.

01:16:38.332 --> 01:16:40.234
I wanted to tell you in person.

01:16:43.204 --> 01:16:44.605
- Why didn't he...
- Call you?

01:16:45.940 --> 01:16:47.808
Nobody's been able to get a hold
of you at all.

01:16:58.152 --> 01:16:59.753
I think I need some help.

01:17:03.257 --> 01:17:04.258
No.

01:17:05.025 --> 01:17:06.026
No.

01:17:06.961 --> 01:17:08.360
Not this time.

01:17:08.362 --> 01:17:10.131
I can't do this anymore.

01:17:11.398 --> 01:17:13.999
Do what anymore?

01:17:14.001 --> 01:17:16.702
Why the fuck do you think
I moved so far away, huh?

01:17:16.704 --> 01:17:19.338
I don't know...
To be an actor, I guess.

01:17:19.340 --> 01:17:21.942
Which you haven't once
asked me about, by the way.

01:17:22.977 --> 01:17:24.044
But, no, that's not it.

01:17:28.782 --> 01:17:30.017
To get away from me?

01:17:30.951 --> 01:17:31.952
Yes.

01:17:32.820 --> 01:17:34.321
Why? Do I embarrass you?

01:17:35.756 --> 01:17:36.989
No.

01:17:36.991 --> 01:17:37.992
No, fuck you.

01:17:38.792 --> 01:17:39.927
I was never embarrassed.

01:17:40.261 --> 01:17:41.426
Ever!

01:17:41.428 --> 01:17:43.929
Don't you dare try
and accuse me of that.

01:17:43.931 --> 01:17:45.764
I always stuck by you.

01:17:45.766 --> 01:17:47.500
Through all the fighting
and the family therapy

01:17:47.502 --> 01:17:50.302
and every time you tried to
swallow a fucking bottle of pills.

01:17:50.304 --> 01:17:52.938
Through every emotional
goddamn ringer.

01:17:52.940 --> 01:17:55.841
I was always there and I
always stood up for you.

01:17:55.843 --> 01:17:57.144
Especially to Mom and Dad.

01:17:57.579 --> 01:17:58.977
And I'm so glad

01:17:58.979 --> 01:18:02.447
that everything's all peachy keen
between you all now, I really am.

01:18:02.449 --> 01:18:05.751
But I'm sick of being involved
in your drama.

01:18:05.753 --> 01:18:08.521
My life is not
defined by you anymore.

01:18:08.523 --> 01:18:12.257
You know when people call me, the
first thing they ask is if you're okay?

01:18:12.259 --> 01:18:14.226
"How's Laurel? Is she okay?"

01:18:14.228 --> 01:18:16.428
"Poor thing,
I hope she's doing better."

01:18:16.430 --> 01:18:18.363
Nobody ever asks if I'm okay.

01:18:18.365 --> 01:18:20.399
But guess what? I'm not,

01:18:20.401 --> 01:18:21.733
and neither was your friend.

01:18:21.735 --> 01:18:24.403
And maybe if you weren't out
kicking ass with the cheetah girls,

01:18:24.405 --> 01:18:26.405
you'd have fucking noticed.

01:18:26.407 --> 01:18:29.074
Don't you for a second
blame this on me.

01:18:29.076 --> 01:18:31.478
I never stood in the way
of you becoming who you are.

01:18:32.146 --> 01:18:34.112
But it turns out who you are

01:18:34.114 --> 01:18:35.316
is a selfish bitch.

01:18:43.457 --> 01:18:44.892
Mark.

01:18:45.292 --> 01:18:46.327
Shit.

01:18:51.865 --> 01:18:53.767
Fuck! Come on, Mark.

01:18:54.068 --> 01:18:55.135
Come on.

01:18:57.838 --> 01:18:58.872
Mark!

01:18:59.974 --> 01:19:00.975
Mark...

01:19:03.177 --> 01:19:04.245
Mark...

01:19:12.286 --> 01:19:13.320
- Come on.
- Ugh.

01:19:16.924 --> 01:19:17.925
Help me!

01:19:18.392 --> 01:19:19.393
Help!

01:19:20.894 --> 01:19:21.895
Help me!

01:19:23.397 --> 01:19:24.398
You're gonna be okay.

01:19:25.533 --> 01:19:26.599
Help!

01:19:26.601 --> 01:19:28.200
You're gonna be fine.

01:19:28.202 --> 01:19:29.203
Help me!

01:19:32.072 --> 01:19:34.942
What the fuck are you guys
just looking at? Help me!

01:19:38.912 --> 01:19:40.112
Duke!

01:19:40.114 --> 01:19:41.413
Duke, I'm so sorry.

01:19:41.415 --> 01:19:43.015
What have you done?

01:19:43.017 --> 01:19:44.149
I messed up.

01:19:44.151 --> 01:19:45.518
Is that who I think it is?

01:19:46.588 --> 01:19:48.186
Laurel, no.

01:19:48.188 --> 01:19:51.189
He hasn't fed yet too, please,
I just need the cure.

01:19:51.191 --> 01:19:53.526
- Please, I'll do anything.
- The cure?

01:19:53.528 --> 01:19:58.030
You can throw me in the hole for however long,
five years, 10 years. I don't give a fuck.

01:19:58.032 --> 01:19:59.300
Just, please.

01:20:05.339 --> 01:20:07.105
You mean this cure?

01:20:07.107 --> 01:20:08.974
God, thank you.

01:20:08.976 --> 01:20:11.443
It's an aeroplane bottle of Everclear,
with the label scratched off.

01:20:11.445 --> 01:20:12.446
What?

01:20:16.250 --> 01:20:17.985
There is no fucking cure.

01:20:19.887 --> 01:20:20.988
We were just gonna kill you.

01:20:24.391 --> 01:20:25.926
Tough titties, kid.

01:20:26.594 --> 01:20:27.595
No.

01:20:28.530 --> 01:20:30.395
I'm sorry, but you brought
this on yourself.

01:20:30.397 --> 01:20:32.931
Duke, don't you fucking touch
my brother.

01:20:34.101 --> 01:20:35.102
Laurel.

01:20:35.770 --> 01:20:37.971
Either you kill him or I do.

01:20:39.239 --> 01:20:40.240
What's going on?

01:20:41.576 --> 01:20:43.344
You have about five seconds
to decide.

01:20:44.978 --> 01:20:46.514
Okay, just... back off.

01:20:47.414 --> 01:20:48.415
Give me some space.

01:20:49.450 --> 01:20:50.451
Laurel.

01:20:53.087 --> 01:20:54.088
Laurel.

01:20:55.557 --> 01:20:56.558
Run.

01:21:07.267 --> 01:21:08.869
Fuck.

01:21:15.710 --> 01:21:17.344
What are you gonna do?
Kill us all?

01:21:18.680 --> 01:21:20.513
When are you going to grow up?

01:21:20.515 --> 01:21:22.147
Look around you.

01:21:22.149 --> 01:21:24.617
How long are you gonna remain
a fucking teenager?

01:21:24.619 --> 01:21:26.320
I never got to be one.

01:21:27.254 --> 01:21:28.523
He took it from me.

01:21:29.390 --> 01:21:30.391
Get over it.

01:21:38.065 --> 01:21:39.066
Let's go, okay?

01:22:26.748 --> 01:22:29.584
And what were all you ladies
bickering about?

01:22:34.221 --> 01:22:35.222
Mark...

01:22:36.156 --> 01:22:37.559
Laurel, huh?

01:22:39.159 --> 01:22:40.693
Stop the car.

01:22:40.695 --> 01:22:42.095
We're not stopping
the fucking car.

01:22:43.130 --> 01:22:45.065
Stop the car.

01:22:45.600 --> 01:22:47.365
Okay.

01:22:47.367 --> 01:22:48.368
I don't know
any of you.

01:22:52.139 --> 01:22:54.141
But I know you know who I am.

01:22:56.511 --> 01:22:57.712
And I know what
you've been told.

01:23:00.815 --> 01:23:03.585
How dare you sit
in judgment of me.

01:23:06.086 --> 01:23:08.121
What was that line
from that movie?

01:23:09.591 --> 01:23:12.993
Most people will never have
to know what they're capable of.

01:23:14.662 --> 01:23:16.662
Once, I was benevolent.

01:23:16.664 --> 01:23:18.298
Once, I was heroic.

01:23:19.701 --> 01:23:22.436
Once, I was charitable.
Once, I was cruel.

01:23:24.572 --> 01:23:26.171
Once, I was cruel

01:23:26.173 --> 01:23:28.576
and once, I was decadent.

01:23:29.644 --> 01:23:31.142
All these things,

01:23:31.144 --> 01:23:33.646
I have been and more
and yet you insist

01:23:33.648 --> 01:23:36.183
on painting me
with one single brush.

01:23:36.751 --> 01:23:38.452
Just because I what?

01:23:40.420 --> 01:23:41.723
Made you feel love?

01:23:43.357 --> 01:23:46.358
Plucked you from obscurity
and gave you eternal life?

01:23:46.360 --> 01:23:48.028
How horrible.

01:23:49.496 --> 01:23:50.532
Rule number one.

01:23:52.432 --> 01:23:55.570
No glamouring another vampire,
that's the way you have it, right?

01:23:57.371 --> 01:23:58.372
Yet...

01:24:00.508 --> 01:24:03.410
I can feel my glamour
in the air.

01:24:06.480 --> 01:24:07.749
Did you ever tell them?

01:24:11.686 --> 01:24:13.721
You all had no idea, did you?

01:24:16.791 --> 01:24:18.758
Oh, it's subtle

01:24:18.760 --> 01:24:20.327
to be sure, but it's there.

01:24:22.329 --> 01:24:23.497
She's in your heads.

01:24:25.265 --> 01:24:26.634
Nudging your decisions.

01:24:28.570 --> 01:24:31.706
Using my stolen power,
to influence your lives.

01:24:33.575 --> 01:24:34.642
It isn't true.

01:24:36.811 --> 01:24:37.812
Hey.

01:24:38.746 --> 01:24:40.913
Who am I to judge?

01:24:40.915 --> 01:24:43.583
Whatever makes you attractive,
right? Well...

01:24:43.585 --> 01:24:45.285
all that's over now.

01:24:47.321 --> 01:24:48.388
Is that true?

01:24:50.457 --> 01:24:51.458
Tell them.

01:24:53.460 --> 01:24:54.461
Duke.

01:24:58.198 --> 01:25:01.368
I did it, to make it easier
to help you.

01:25:03.203 --> 01:25:04.471
And there we have it.

01:25:05.840 --> 01:25:08.108
Don't be too harsh
on her though, girls.

01:25:21.522 --> 01:25:22.523
You know...

01:25:24.191 --> 01:25:27.660
it's been so long,
I think I need to celebrate.

01:25:27.662 --> 01:25:30.328
A night on the town,
what do you think?

01:25:30.330 --> 01:25:32.197
Maybe,

01:25:32.199 --> 01:25:33.868
dress you up all nice and foxy.

01:25:36.738 --> 01:25:37.739
Mmm.

01:25:39.907 --> 01:25:40.908
On the other hand...

01:25:44.979 --> 01:25:47.214
I think I'd rather
just kill you.

01:26:04.766 --> 01:26:06.433
Who do we have here?

01:26:24.752 --> 01:26:26.587
I suppose,
it is the new millennium.

01:26:31.291 --> 01:26:32.958
A-ha.

01:26:32.960 --> 01:26:35.495
Not sure you've been
paying attention, but...

01:27:24.512 --> 01:27:25.513
Laurel.

01:27:30.785 --> 01:27:32.754
I suppose you'll reconsider
my brother.

01:27:33.654 --> 01:27:34.856
He'll turn cruel.

01:27:35.690 --> 01:27:37.690
You watch and learn.

01:27:37.692 --> 01:27:39.927
Maybe you need some time
to think about it then.

01:27:51.873 --> 01:27:54.008
So, what do you guys say
we come up with some new rules?

01:27:55.643 --> 01:27:57.410
<i>So... vampires, huh?</i>

01:27:59.479 --> 01:28:01.714
- Yeah.
- Great.

01:28:01.716 --> 01:28:02.717
I'm sorry.

01:28:05.052 --> 01:28:06.386
This is so fucked.

01:28:07.420 --> 01:28:08.788
I don't want this.

01:28:08.790 --> 01:28:09.891
I don't wanna
even be a vampire.

01:28:10.758 --> 01:28:12.124
Neither did I.

01:28:12.126 --> 01:28:14.529
Life's full of shit you never think should happen.

01:28:15.997 --> 01:28:17.495
And it does.

01:28:17.497 --> 01:28:18.564
You should just kill me.

01:28:18.566 --> 01:28:19.565
No.

01:28:19.567 --> 01:28:21.967
I don't want to drink
fucking blood, Laurel.

01:28:21.969 --> 01:28:23.869
Then, don't.

01:28:23.871 --> 01:28:25.540
We'll figure this out,
we've got time.

01:28:26.941 --> 01:28:27.942
What if she's right?

01:28:28.776 --> 01:28:30.743
What if I turn... cruel?

01:28:30.745 --> 01:28:32.511
Fuck that.

01:28:32.513 --> 01:28:35.781
Look, just 'cause you're a dude doesn't mean
you have an excuse to become a shithead.

01:28:35.783 --> 01:28:37.618
Control your goddamn behavior
and you'll be fine.

01:28:38.753 --> 01:28:39.754
Or what?

01:28:41.622 --> 01:28:42.755
Or...

01:28:42.757 --> 01:28:43.758
else.

01:28:48.529 --> 01:28:49.831
Mark, I'm sorry.

01:28:50.698 --> 01:28:51.699
For everything.

01:28:53.433 --> 01:28:56.401
We can do this together.

01:28:56.403 --> 01:28:58.906
I've got your back, I will do
my best to never let you down.

01:29:00.842 --> 01:29:02.944
You know, maybe we have a chance
to do something here.

01:29:04.779 --> 01:29:05.780
Like what?

01:29:06.180 --> 01:29:07.380
I don't know.

01:29:08.916 --> 01:29:13.085
I picture a world where
everyone's a vampire.

01:29:13.087 --> 01:29:16.524
'Cause then we'd all be forced to deal with
each other until we figure our shit out.

01:29:20.161 --> 01:29:21.596
I'm fucking scared, Lolo.

01:29:22.930 --> 01:29:23.931
It's gonna be okay.

01:29:28.836 --> 01:29:29.837
So what do we do now?

01:29:32.006 --> 01:29:35.042
Maybe what everyone with power
should do and never does.

01:29:36.744 --> 01:29:37.745
Share it.

01:30:20.788 --> 01:30:21.822
Who's next?

01:30:33.834 --> 01:30:35.067
<i>Well, that was fun,</i>

01:30:35.069 --> 01:30:38.070
<i>I hope they make more of these
and I promise there's no way</i>

01:30:38.072 --> 01:30:39.907
<i>I'd get pregnant
in the fourth one.</i>
