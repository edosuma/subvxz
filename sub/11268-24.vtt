        Cheers <i>is filmed</i>        
 <i>before a live studio audience.</i> 

00:06.072 --> 00:07.506
     Afternoon, everybody.      

00:07.574 --> 00:08.807
              ALL:              
             Norm!              

00:08.875 --> 00:11.110
        Hey, Mr. P. How's       
         life in the big city?  

00:11.177 --> 00:13.946
     Hey, what'd I tell you     
     about those fat jokes?     

00:16.649 --> 00:18.817
    Uh, what's                  
in the box there, Norm?         

00:18.885 --> 00:20.719
    Only my brand-new           
     Turbo Flex Airmasters      

00:20.787 --> 00:22.287
    with the custom pump fit    

00:22.355 --> 00:24.289
         and the night reflector
                  racing stripe.

00:24.357 --> 00:25.624
                 Ah, whoa!      

00:25.692 --> 00:27.192
Ooh, look at that!              

00:27.260 --> 00:28.794
    Major shoe.                 

00:28.862 --> 00:31.330
            And check out the   
                 reflector, huh?

00:31.398 --> 00:34.166
      Wow, shines like          
    the Northern Lights.        

00:34.234 --> 00:35.668
                            Yep.

00:35.735 --> 00:37.569
                 Get this-- they
              utilize a patented

00:37.637 --> 00:39.204
                 ergonomic lever
              propulsion design.

00:39.272 --> 00:42.307
            Uses your body's own
Achilles tendon as a fulcrum.   

00:42.375 --> 00:43.709
        I read in <i>Runner's World</i>

00:43.777 --> 00:46.145
      that they can improve your
vertical leap by ten percent.   

00:46.212 --> 00:47.479
                  Try 12%, babe.

00:47.547 --> 00:49.214
                Ooh.            

00:49.282 --> 00:52.451
Ah, that's more than            
a shoe there, Normie,           
that's a god.                   

00:52.519 --> 00:54.353
                 And now, if you
          gentlemen will just...

00:54.421 --> 00:55.988
                      stand back
                 for a second...

00:57.924 --> 01:00.526
                ...I'm gonna try
              these puppies out.

01:03.196 --> 01:04.663
         And we're off!         

01:05.865 --> 01:07.633

02:19.706 --> 02:22.374
        Okay, Paulie, at 7:00 we
    go over to Gary's, right?   

02:22.442 --> 02:23.776
Oh, wait a minute,              

02:23.843 --> 02:25.878
     wait a minute, you're      
going over to Gary's bar?       

02:25.945 --> 02:27.579
                    Well, Sammy,
                 big heavyweight
                 fight tonight--

02:27.647 --> 02:29.481
            he's got a satellite
                dish, you don't.

02:29.549 --> 02:32.117
You're deserting me             
for that snake?                 

02:32.185 --> 02:33.619
You're gonna give money         
to the one guy I hate           

02:33.753 --> 02:34.953
more than anyone else           
in the whole world?             

02:35.021 --> 02:36.188
      'Course not, Sammy.       

02:36.256 --> 02:37.723
      I'm gonna run a tab.      

02:39.893 --> 02:42.594
Sammy, we wouldn't go anywhere  
if you had a satellite dish.    
                    Mm-hmm.     

02:42.662 --> 02:44.897
     All right, all right,      
 if it means that much to you,  

02:44.964 --> 02:46.432
I will look into it, all right? 

02:46.499 --> 02:49.034
      I, for one, am filled with
        a sense of foreboding   

02:49.102 --> 02:51.103
          when I contemplate the
             future of a culture

02:51.171 --> 02:53.238
                whose primary   
            source of recreation

02:53.306 --> 02:56.175
            is watching more and
    more mindless television.   

02:56.242 --> 02:57.643
    Don't you agree, Frasier?   

02:57.711 --> 03:00.446
Now, why is Gilligan magnetized?

03:04.451 --> 03:06.752
                  Because he was
            struck by lightning.

03:06.820 --> 03:09.455
Every time this episode airs,   
          you ask that question.

03:11.524 --> 03:12.825
              Sam?              

03:12.892 --> 03:14.927
Damn it, now, why is Cliff      

03:14.994 --> 03:17.863
    having his personal mail    
        sent to my bar?         

03:17.931 --> 03:20.099
Well, when you've been harassed 
    by as many agents           

03:20.166 --> 03:22.334
of the government as Cliff has, 
     you naturally develop      

03:22.402 --> 03:24.803
a reluctance to give them       
    your own return address.    

03:24.871 --> 03:26.705
                     Ah, Cliffie
                    got a letter

03:26.773 --> 03:28.273
          from <i>The Tonight Show</i> 
                  in California.

03:28.341 --> 03:30.876
Is he still trying              
to sell jokes                   
to Johnny Carson?               

03:30.944 --> 03:33.012
When's that poor guy            
gonna give up.                  

03:33.079 --> 03:35.147
  He is-- I hear he's leaving   
  the show at the end of May.   

03:39.185 --> 03:40.552
        Hey, everybody.         

03:40.620 --> 03:42.388
Hey, Cliffie!                   
                      Hey.      

03:42.455 --> 03:44.556
          Sam, pour me          
      a cold one, will ya?      

03:44.624 --> 03:45.991
     It's been a long day.      

03:46.059 --> 03:47.860
    What's the problem, bub?    

03:47.927 --> 03:49.461
         Eh, hard to say, I, uh,

03:49.529 --> 03:52.297
          just seem to have lost
          the spring in my step.

03:52.365 --> 03:55.868
      Well, just pull one       
    out of your head.           

03:55.935 --> 03:57.736
        Oh, hey, you got        
    a letter from NBC.          

03:57.804 --> 04:00.172
        Aw, forget it--         
  it's just another rejection.  

04:00.240 --> 04:02.541
    Oh, come on, now,           
     how do you know that?      
                      Aw, Sammy,

04:02.609 --> 04:03.742
      I'm just a plaything      

04:03.810 --> 04:05.944
     of that fickle maiden      
     known as Miss Comedy.      

04:07.614 --> 04:11.417
     Last night I went down     
  to The Laugh Tureen to gig.   

04:11.484 --> 04:13.385
Well, they wouldn't             
let me go on.                   

04:13.453 --> 04:15.921
It was amateur night--          
they said I wasn't ready.       

04:15.989 --> 04:18.156
            Cliff, you're not   
            going to give up.   

04:18.224 --> 04:20.091
          With the current sorry
             state of the world,

04:20.160 --> 04:22.060
              we need your humor
             now more than ever.

04:22.128 --> 04:23.862
          Well, yeah, thank you 
            very much, Lilith.  

04:23.930 --> 04:26.331
  You know, you've always been  
    my number one fan.          

04:26.399 --> 04:28.934
            In fact,            
    you've been my only fan.    

04:29.002 --> 04:31.437
                (laughing)      

04:31.504 --> 04:32.705
  (Lilith continues laughing)   

04:32.839 --> 04:33.939
        I wasn't joking.        

04:35.108 --> 04:36.642
                  Oh. I'm sorry.

04:36.710 --> 04:40.045
It must have been the way you   
  instinctively time everything.

04:40.113 --> 04:41.880
You can't learn that, you know. 

04:43.216 --> 04:44.583
    Save your breath.           

04:44.651 --> 04:46.552
Nothing's gonna do me any good. 

04:46.619 --> 04:48.821
Aw, Cliff, why don't            
you just go on back             

04:48.888 --> 04:50.589
and lie down                    
on the pool table.              

04:50.657 --> 04:53.092
I think there's                 
a game going on.                

04:54.494 --> 04:57.129
         Everybody's a comedian.

04:57.197 --> 04:59.331
            Everybody except me.

05:00.633 --> 05:01.900
REBECCA:                        
Carla,                          

05:01.968 --> 05:03.469
            you hurt him.       

05:03.536 --> 05:05.704
    Oh, thanks.                 

05:05.772 --> 05:07.940
Well, I'll tell you             
what I'm gonna do,              

05:08.008 --> 05:09.608
I-I'm just gonna                
open this letter.               

05:09.676 --> 05:11.076
Maybe it is good news.          

05:11.144 --> 05:13.946
I'm just so sick and tired      
of everybody in this bar        

05:14.014 --> 05:15.514
having such                     
a negative attitude.            

05:15.582 --> 05:17.983
I mean, you know,               
good things do happen.          

05:18.051 --> 05:19.685
So, did they buy his joke?      

05:19.753 --> 05:22.321
        (scoffs):               
    Yeah, what do <i>you</i> think?    

05:23.423 --> 05:24.923
                    "Mr. Clavin,
             thank you very much

05:24.991 --> 05:26.692
            "for your submission
            to <i>The Tonight Show.</i>

05:26.760 --> 05:28.460
        "We will not be using   
                  your material.

05:28.528 --> 05:30.129
                     Enclosed is
            your submission."   

05:30.196 --> 05:31.697
Hey, what was it this time?     

05:31.765 --> 05:35.300
Let me put my beer down--       
I don't want it coming          
through my nose.                

05:38.905 --> 05:40.239
        "Today is               
Doc Severinsen's birthday.      

05:40.306 --> 05:43.142
"You know, Doc is so old,       
    when he was a kid           

05:43.209 --> 05:45.577
"he never blew out candles      
     on his birthday cake.      

05:45.645 --> 05:47.680
  They didn't have fire yet."   

05:47.781 --> 05:49.948
                      (laughing)

05:51.017 --> 05:52.251
     Lilith!                    

05:52.318 --> 05:54.987
You can't possibly be laughing  
at that terrible joke.          

05:55.055 --> 05:59.158
            You don't find humor
             in the exaggeration
        of a contemporary man   

05:59.225 --> 06:03.495
        predating an event which
    took place 45,000 years ago?

06:03.563 --> 06:09.201
Well, had Cliff phrased it      
like that, sure, hellzapoppin.  

06:09.269 --> 06:12.471
          Poor Cliffie. I really
         kind of hate to see him
            suffering like this.

06:12.539 --> 06:13.839
CARLA:                          
You know,                       

06:13.907 --> 06:18.177
         I think it's about time
      we had Cliff put to sleep.

06:19.713 --> 06:22.614
              What? He had a lot
                  of good years.

06:24.284 --> 06:26.085
        There is one way        
    to cheer him up--           

06:26.152 --> 06:28.320
you know, we could change       
    this letter of rejection    

06:28.388 --> 06:30.122
          to look like          
    a letter of acceptance.     

06:31.458 --> 06:32.825
 It'd be pretty easy, actually. 

06:32.892 --> 06:34.460
                 So are you just
                gonna dismiss   

06:34.527 --> 06:35.694
                 my putting-him-
                  to-sleep idea?

06:37.297 --> 06:40.399
                  We're not even
            gonna <i>talk</i> about it?

06:40.467 --> 06:43.802
  You know, all we have to do is
just white-out the word "not"   

06:43.870 --> 06:47.573
        and... it looks like,   

06:47.640 --> 06:51.377
    "we <i>will</i> be using           
    your submission."           

06:51.444 --> 06:54.146
    You're pretty good          
with that white-out stuff.      

06:54.214 --> 06:56.849
         Sammy, I used          
      to be an accountant.      

06:58.952 --> 07:01.954
  Many is the time this stuff   
  kept me out of Leavenworth.   

07:03.156 --> 07:05.124
    I don't know, gentlemen.    

07:05.191 --> 07:09.028
Should we really encourage Cliff
in these flights of fancy?      

07:09.095 --> 07:12.331
     I cite for an example      
 his Kennedy conspiracy theory. 

07:12.399 --> 07:14.066
          I, for one,           
      have never believed       

07:14.134 --> 07:15.834
the Beatles were involved.      

07:19.072 --> 07:21.173
        Give the guy a break.   
                 Okay? For once.

07:21.241 --> 07:23.075
Cliffie! Cliffie come out here. 
                        Yeah?   

07:23.143 --> 07:24.877
We opened your letter           
from <i>The Tonight Show.</i>          

07:24.944 --> 07:25.944
Johnny loves the joke.          

07:26.012 --> 07:27.146
They're going                   
to use it on the show.          

07:27.213 --> 07:28.280
             Oh, you're kidding.

07:28.348 --> 07:30.649
Read it. Go ahead.              

07:30.717 --> 07:32.051
              (muttering)       

07:32.118 --> 07:34.086
                  Hey! I did it!
Ha-ha!                          

07:34.154 --> 07:37.389
I did it! I, uh, I sold         
a joke to Johnny Carson!        

07:37.457 --> 07:38.891
                      (laughs)  

07:38.958 --> 07:41.293
Oh, this is the happiest        
moment of my life!              

07:41.361 --> 07:42.561
Well, take your                 

07:42.629 --> 07:44.697
 last look at Clifford Clavin,  
        letter carrier.         

07:44.764 --> 07:47.166
    Yeah, when my joke          
    hits the airwaves,          

07:47.233 --> 07:48.634
 I'm gonna start a new career.  

07:48.702 --> 07:51.837
     Yep, it's going to be      
  Cliff Clavin, joke meister.   

07:51.905 --> 07:53.972
Doctor of Ha-Ha, the funny man. 

07:54.040 --> 07:55.841
Yeah,                           

07:55.909 --> 07:57.009
 I'm going to be hanging around 

07:57.077 --> 07:58.844
     with a whole new group     
          of friends:           

07:58.912 --> 08:00.946
        Oscar and Emmy.         

08:02.749 --> 08:04.616
             Ciao.              

08:05.719 --> 08:08.587
Carla, what was your plan again?

08:08.655 --> 08:12.024
      Okay, so we tell him      
he's getting a flu shot...      

08:18.998 --> 08:20.699
Hey, Sammy, look at this.       

08:20.767 --> 08:22.468
     Here it is right here      
    in the classified.          

08:22.535 --> 08:24.770
You can buy a used              
satellite dish                  

08:24.838 --> 08:27.473
for 300 bucks,                  
install it yourself.            

08:27.540 --> 08:30.042
  I don't know anything about   
  installing a satellite dish.  

08:30.110 --> 08:31.710
Oh, come on, Sam,               
what's the big deal?            

08:31.778 --> 08:32.811
You clamp it to the roof        

08:32.879 --> 08:34.645
and you run                     
a few wires down.               

08:34.714 --> 08:36.081
WOODY:                          
I don't know, Carla.            

08:36.149 --> 08:38.116
My Uncle Skyler                 
tried to do that                

08:38.183 --> 08:40.652
with a milking machine right    
before an electrical storm.     

08:42.688 --> 08:44.623
 Cows never forgave him for it. 

08:45.992 --> 08:47.559
    It was worth it, though.    

08:47.627 --> 08:48.961
We had cottage cheese sandwiches

08:49.029 --> 08:50.295
          for a month,          
        I'm telling you.        

08:52.198 --> 08:54.500
        Hey, everybody.         
          Guess what.           

08:54.567 --> 08:55.734
      Cliff Clavin is off       

08:55.802 --> 08:57.169
  to the entertainment capital  
         of the world--         

08:57.237 --> 08:58.404
    the dream factory,          

08:58.471 --> 09:01.273
    the land of glitz,          
glamour and make-believe.       

09:01.341 --> 09:03.375
    What, you're going          
    to Chucky Cheese?           

09:03.443 --> 09:05.110
        No, Woody.              

09:05.178 --> 09:07.546
Going to Hollyweird, California.

09:07.614 --> 09:09.114
             Yeah, I've got some
                nonrefundable   

09:09.182 --> 09:11.216
tickets here in my hand; they're
    going to take me to Burbank.

09:11.284 --> 09:13.619
And, uh, when Johnny Carson     
delights America with my joke,  

09:13.687 --> 09:16.021
me and Ma are going to be       
sitting there watching it live. 

09:16.089 --> 09:17.389
                        NORM:   
                    You know,   

09:17.457 --> 09:19.058
             they write an awful
            lot of jokes, Cliff.

09:19.125 --> 09:21.026
                 Uh, just 'cause
            they bought yours   

09:21.094 --> 09:22.961
        doesn't necessarily mean
        they're gonna use it.   

09:23.029 --> 09:26.632
Aw, geez, Norm, uh,             
I'm a little confused here.     

09:26.700 --> 09:29.001
I guess you're the one          
who is currently employed       

09:29.069 --> 09:31.670
as a writer for <i>The Tonight Show</i>
 starring Johnny Carson.        

09:33.573 --> 09:35.341
            You're right, Cliff.

09:35.408 --> 09:37.543
    I'm just saying you could   
          be setting yourself up

09:37.610 --> 09:38.844
            for a big fall here.

09:38.912 --> 09:40.379
(laughs):                       
Norm.                           

09:40.447 --> 09:42.781
The only question is is whether 
Johnny is going to invite me    

09:42.849 --> 09:44.883
to sit up there                 
on the couch next to him.       

09:44.951 --> 09:46.218
                        Oh, hey,

09:46.286 --> 09:47.486
      I'd better call Ma.       

09:47.554 --> 09:48.620
      She'll be thrilled.       

09:49.723 --> 09:51.623
You've got to do something, man.

09:51.691 --> 09:53.058
This has gone far enough.       

09:53.126 --> 09:54.560
        I can't, Sammy.         

09:54.694 --> 09:56.095
I'm no good at giving bad news. 

09:56.162 --> 09:57.796
Oh, what are you talking about? 

09:57.864 --> 10:00.232
You told Vera about losing      
     all those jobs, right?     

10:00.300 --> 10:02.768
     I'm gonna get to that,     
    when the time is right.     

10:02.836 --> 10:04.370
              All right, I will.

10:04.437 --> 10:06.038
        I will. I will.         

10:06.106 --> 10:08.407
          Uh, oh, boy.          
          I was right.          

10:08.475 --> 10:09.942
     She was tickled pink.      

10:10.010 --> 10:12.077
      Yeah, the two places      
     she most wants to see      

10:12.145 --> 10:15.581
  before she goes to the great  
 beyond is Formosa and Burbank. 

10:15.648 --> 10:17.082
                        Cliffie,

10:17.150 --> 10:18.717
            there's something   
      I have to tell you, buddy.

10:18.785 --> 10:20.052
Oh, wait.                       
Norm, there's something         

10:20.120 --> 10:21.353
I got to tell you first.        

10:21.421 --> 10:23.155
                         Well...
        When I was              
      at the travel agency,     

10:23.223 --> 10:26.759
 I got, uh, <i>three</i> nonrefundable 
      tickets to Burbank.       

10:26.826 --> 10:28.894
      And guess whose name      
      is on the third one.      

10:28.962 --> 10:31.263
             Please don't let it
            be Norm Peterson.   

10:31.331 --> 10:33.265
Norm Peterson!                  

10:34.334 --> 10:36.101
        I'm going to California!

10:36.169 --> 10:37.403
(Norm and Cliff cheering)       

10:43.209 --> 10:44.677
              ¶ ¶               

11:13.606 --> 11:15.507
              ¶ ¶               

12:05.959 --> 12:08.727
             I love working with
    my hands, don't you, Sam?   

12:08.795 --> 12:10.129
    Yeah, Woody, I do.          

12:10.196 --> 12:14.233
          But not with          
     any mechanical stuff.      

12:14.300 --> 12:17.202
Hey, do you have any idea       
  how a satellite dish works?   

12:17.270 --> 12:19.505
You mean you don't?             

12:19.572 --> 12:21.874
         Well, to be honest, no.

12:21.941 --> 12:24.243
        Well, you've got        
     a satellite up there.      

12:24.310 --> 12:25.911
    How far up there?           

12:25.979 --> 12:29.682
Oh, about 72 million miles,     
give or take a few light years. 

12:29.749 --> 12:31.183
And it's got                    

12:31.251 --> 12:34.987
a gizmo up there so when you    
send your TV stuff up there     

12:35.055 --> 12:38.090
it shoots it right back         
down here to this baby.         

12:38.158 --> 12:41.760
    Boy, you sure know a lot    
     about the world, Sam.      

12:41.828 --> 12:45.264
 Oh, Woody, I'm an avid reader. 

12:45.331 --> 12:48.901
     When you look up there     
    at all those stars          

12:48.968 --> 12:50.569
and all those galaxies...       

12:52.939 --> 12:55.674
    you realize just how big    
 this satellite dish really is. 

13:01.014 --> 13:02.915
    Boy, oh, boy.               

13:02.982 --> 13:04.283
This is something,              
isn't it, Ma?                   

13:04.351 --> 13:05.617
Who would have believed it?     

13:05.685 --> 13:07.686
There it is, the couch,         
the desk and the curtains.      

13:07.754 --> 13:09.621
                    Huh? Huh?   

13:09.689 --> 13:11.790
              Listen, Cliff, um,
                before Johnny   

13:11.858 --> 13:12.991
        starts his monologue,   

13:13.059 --> 13:14.593
             there's something I
        really want to tell you.

13:14.661 --> 13:16.762
Oh, suddenly it's               
Johnny, huh, Norm?              

13:16.830 --> 13:18.364
I mean, I work with the man     

13:18.431 --> 13:20.099
and I don't even get            
to call him Johnny.             

13:20.166 --> 13:22.001
            Anyway, before he   
            starts the monologue

13:22.068 --> 13:23.535
            I'd like to tell you
                something, okay?

13:23.603 --> 13:25.404
     Hey, uh, Cliff Clavin.     

13:25.472 --> 13:26.538
        I'm from Boston.        

13:26.606 --> 13:28.474
          I, uh, wrote          
      tonight's monologue.      

13:28.541 --> 13:29.641
Really?                         

13:29.709 --> 13:30.876
Then you know Johnny?           

13:30.944 --> 13:34.413
              Well, does anybody
             really know Johnny?

13:36.383 --> 13:38.717
Hey, there's those people       
        we met in line.         

13:38.785 --> 13:40.452
      I'm going to go over      
    and say howdy-do.           

13:42.622 --> 13:45.424
Norman, I want to thank you.    

13:45.492 --> 13:46.658
                 For what?      

13:46.726 --> 13:49.928
Well, I know Clifford           
doesn't have many friends.      

13:49.996 --> 13:52.698
I remember that surprise        
birthday party I organized      

13:52.766 --> 13:55.501
for him and you were            
the only one who showed up.     

13:55.568 --> 13:56.735
                     Yeah.      

13:56.803 --> 13:57.803
         Where were you, anyway?

13:57.871 --> 14:01.140
    I just forgot.              

14:01.207 --> 14:04.076
             Mrs. Clavin, I have
        a confession to make.   

14:04.144 --> 14:05.844
What do you mean?               

14:05.912 --> 14:09.181
         <i>The Tonight Show</i> didn't
     really accept Cliff's joke.

14:09.249 --> 14:11.450
              I got ahold of the
                rejection letter

14:11.518 --> 14:14.720
        and I sort of changed it
          around to make it look
         as if they accepted it.

14:14.788 --> 14:16.722
    Oh, my Lord.                

14:16.790 --> 14:18.157
I wanted to tell him earlier,   

14:18.224 --> 14:20.392
        but it's been so long   
    since I've had a vacation   

14:20.460 --> 14:21.860
                  and Lord knows
                I've needed one.

14:21.928 --> 14:26.131
Norman, you are a               
naughty, naughty boy.           

14:26.199 --> 14:27.700
                      I'm sorry.

14:27.767 --> 14:29.034
You're his best friend.         

14:29.102 --> 14:32.037
You've got to do something      
or suffer the consequences.     

14:32.105 --> 14:34.640
                    Okay.       

14:34.708 --> 14:37.509
              All right, uh, let
        me see what I can do.   

14:41.281 --> 14:43.649
                 (clears throat)

14:43.717 --> 14:44.750
            Excuse me, buddy.   

14:44.818 --> 14:46.118
             Uh, could I talk to
            you for a minute?   

14:46.186 --> 14:48.454
What do you need?               

14:48.521 --> 14:51.390
    Um, how would you like to   
    make a couple hundred bucks?

14:51.458 --> 14:54.226
What are you talking about?     

14:54.294 --> 14:55.728
                A friend of mine
                wrote this joke,

14:55.795 --> 14:57.329
             and I was wondering
            if you could, uh,   

14:57.397 --> 14:59.732
            sort of slip it into
      Johnny Carson's monologue.

14:59.799 --> 15:01.333
Oh, sure,                       
we do it all the time.          

15:01.401 --> 15:02.668
Most of Johnny's jokes          

15:02.736 --> 15:04.336
come from folks                 
just like yourself              

15:04.404 --> 15:06.572
in the audience                 
who offer us money.             

15:08.675 --> 15:10.676
                I admit it's,   
                it's a bad joke,

15:10.744 --> 15:13.579
            but the guy's entire
    existence is riding on this.

15:13.646 --> 15:15.280
This is a bad joke?             

15:15.348 --> 15:17.016
I mean a sure clunker?          

15:17.083 --> 15:19.018
Johnny will definitely bomb     
with this?                      

15:19.085 --> 15:20.519
            I'm afraid so, yeah.

15:20.587 --> 15:23.789
Well, I'm out of work           
in a month anyway.              

15:23.857 --> 15:26.592
Jay Leno has                    
his own people.                 

15:26.659 --> 15:27.693
Let me see the joke.            

15:27.761 --> 15:30.229
                Oh, great, thank
                    you so much.

15:30.296 --> 15:31.663
                  How much can I
                  give you, huh?

15:31.731 --> 15:32.664
Ah, don't worry about it.       

15:32.766 --> 15:35.000
Just buy me a beer              
after the show.                 

15:36.069 --> 15:38.604
                Wherever you go,
            people are the same.

15:42.676 --> 15:43.809
                  Well, Woody, I
                think we did it.

15:43.877 --> 15:45.577
                  I think we got
             this thing working.

15:45.645 --> 15:46.712
              Sam.              

15:46.780 --> 15:48.080
             Yeah?              

15:48.148 --> 15:50.015
You think there's a reason      

15:50.083 --> 15:52.985
      for all these stars       
  and all these planets and...  

15:54.788 --> 15:57.790
  ...for all of us being here   
         where we are?          

15:57.857 --> 16:00.726
              Yeah, Woody, I do.

16:00.794 --> 16:03.262
     Well, would you happen     
  to know what that reason is?  

16:04.397 --> 16:06.598
  Come on, man, I'm just proud  

16:06.666 --> 16:09.635
        of myself for installing
            this satellite dish.

16:09.703 --> 16:11.503
Do you think I'm supposed       
      to marry Kelly, Sam?      

16:11.571 --> 16:13.906
      I mean, do you think      
that's what the plan is for me? 

16:13.973 --> 16:15.774
 You getting cold feet, buddy?  

16:15.842 --> 16:18.277
          Well, yeah,           
 it is a little chilly up here, 

16:18.345 --> 16:20.879
         but I'm trying         
     to talk philosophical.     

16:20.947 --> 16:22.281
         Yeah, I think          
     you should marry her.      

16:22.349 --> 16:23.982
You guys are in love, man.      

16:24.050 --> 16:25.250
             That's the best.   

16:25.318 --> 16:26.919
                 (sighs)        

16:26.986 --> 16:29.655
     You know, sometimes I don't
think I'll ever find someone.   

16:29.723 --> 16:33.425
    I thought Diane was going   
        to be the one, but...   

16:33.493 --> 16:35.027
                    it turns out
                     she wasn't.

16:35.095 --> 16:37.096
          Which was lucky for me
         because if she had been

16:37.163 --> 16:39.264
            I just would have   
            ended up killing her

16:39.332 --> 16:41.967
                and dying in the
                 electric chair.

16:44.037 --> 16:47.206
That is lucky.                  

16:47.273 --> 16:49.074
                    And Rebecca.

16:49.142 --> 16:51.110
              Well, we wanted to
        have a baby together,   

16:51.177 --> 16:54.546
         but that's no reason to
    get serious about anyone.   

16:57.083 --> 16:58.784
             You know, I used to
            think I had it made.

16:58.852 --> 17:01.954
            You know, I-I got   
             my freedom, my bar,

17:02.022 --> 17:04.323
             goes without saying
             I'm a love machine,

17:04.391 --> 17:08.827
         but recently, you know,
        when I've been alone,   

17:08.895 --> 17:10.762
                    I kind of   
                    feel lonely.

17:10.829 --> 17:14.299
Well, Sam, uh, you know,        
Kelly and I are probably going  

17:14.367 --> 17:17.403
to have a big,                  
beautiful house someday         

17:17.470 --> 17:19.570
with, uh, you know,             

17:19.638 --> 17:22.675
a garden and swimming pool      
and lots of servants,           

17:22.742 --> 17:24.943
and when you get too old        
to take care of yourself,       

17:25.011 --> 17:26.444
you can come live               
with us.                        

17:26.512 --> 17:28.614
          Aw, that's sweet, man,
             but I think I'll...

17:28.682 --> 17:30.516
                    (chuckling):
                 ...I think I'll
              be able to manage.

17:34.354 --> 17:37.423
                     Would I get
                    my own room?

17:37.524 --> 17:41.760
And now, he-ere's Johnny.       

17:41.861 --> 17:43.262
        (applause)              
    Thank you, folks.           

17:43.329 --> 17:45.698
     Please don't suck up;      
 I'm leaving everything to Doc. 

17:45.765 --> 17:47.666
             I don't know if you
            know this or not,   

17:47.734 --> 17:49.335
          but today is          
Doc Severinsen's birthday.      

17:49.402 --> 17:51.603
        (applause)              

17:53.540 --> 17:55.107
 You really dressed up tonight. 

17:55.175 --> 17:56.875
         Yeah, a little         
    something special.          

17:56.976 --> 17:58.143
          If you think          
      that's in bad taste,      

17:58.211 --> 18:00.245
      you ought to see him      
in his real birthday suit.      

18:00.347 --> 18:02.348
        (laughter)              

18:02.449 --> 18:03.482
        Doc is so old...        

18:03.550 --> 18:04.550
Oh, my God,                     
here it comes.                  

18:04.784 --> 18:06.452
ALL:                            
How old is he?                  

18:06.519 --> 18:07.853
     Yes.                       
                      ...when he
                    was a kid   

18:07.921 --> 18:09.988
he never blew out candles       
      on a birthday cake.       

18:10.056 --> 18:11.023
They didn't have fire yet.      

18:11.091 --> 18:12.024
    (audience groans)           

18:12.092 --> 18:13.926
                            Ooh,

18:13.993 --> 18:15.861
      stay where you are.       

18:15.929 --> 18:17.629
      Fortunately, folks,       
in a situation like this,       

18:17.697 --> 18:19.631
    the, uh, the band           
 has instructions to come over  

18:19.699 --> 18:21.700
    and form a human barrier    
      in front of a star.       

18:21.768 --> 18:24.536
        How did that line get   
        on the cue cards anyway?

18:24.604 --> 18:25.804
  I should have done that joke  

18:25.872 --> 18:28.440
with one of those big blue dots 
    covering my face.           

18:28.508 --> 18:29.875
                  Who wrote that
                    joke anyway?

18:30.043 --> 18:31.377
I-I wrote that joke             

18:31.444 --> 18:32.711
and it was great.               

18:32.879 --> 18:34.713
        Pardon me?              

18:34.781 --> 18:36.849
The problem wasn't the joke,    
the problem was you.            

18:36.916 --> 18:37.916
        You botched it.         

18:37.984 --> 18:40.019
      You botched my joke,      
         Johnny Carson!         

18:41.755 --> 18:42.955
Sit down, please.               
      I'm not going to sit down!

18:43.023 --> 18:44.089
              I wrote that joke.

18:44.190 --> 18:45.391
     Get your hands off me.     

18:45.458 --> 18:47.926
Is this the way you treat       
     your talent, Carson?!      

18:49.262 --> 18:51.697
     Ladies and gentlemen,      
     the president of NBC.      

18:51.765 --> 18:54.233
        (applause)              

18:56.736 --> 18:58.337
    Excuse me.                  

18:58.405 --> 19:00.272
With all due respect,           
Mr. Carson,                     

19:00.340 --> 19:02.675
you didn't tell                 
my son's joke correctly.        

19:02.742 --> 19:03.676
    You're his mother?          

19:03.743 --> 19:04.777
Yes.                            

19:04.878 --> 19:06.679
And I want you                  
to tell it again                

19:06.746 --> 19:09.648
and this time                   
put a little life into it.      

19:11.051 --> 19:12.551
    Audience, can you stand     
    to hear this joke again?    

19:12.619 --> 19:13.585
        (applause)              

19:17.490 --> 19:19.591
        Doc is so old...        

19:19.659 --> 19:21.527
              ALL:              
         How old is he?         

19:21.594 --> 19:22.961
      ...when he was a kid      
he never blew out candles       

19:23.129 --> 19:24.063
      on a birthday cake.       

19:24.130 --> 19:25.798
They didn't have fire yet.      

19:25.865 --> 19:27.266
      (audience groaning)       

19:27.367 --> 19:31.203
No, no, now tell it again and   
this time hit the word "have."  

19:31.271 --> 19:35.240
And it wouldn't kill you        
to turn on the applause sign.   

19:35.308 --> 19:36.508
 Hit, hit, hit the word "have"? 

19:36.576 --> 19:37.543
Have.                           

19:40.080 --> 19:42.548
        Doc is so old...        

19:42.615 --> 19:44.717
              ALL:              
         How old is he?         

19:44.784 --> 19:46.151
      ...when he was a kid      
he never blew out candles       

19:46.319 --> 19:47.319
      on a birthday cake.       

19:47.387 --> 19:48.387
They didn't <i>have</i> fire yet.      

19:48.455 --> 19:49.388
(cheering                       
and applause)                   

20:00.767 --> 20:02.901
You see, they heard that joke   
three times                     

20:02.969 --> 20:04.169
and they still laughed.         

20:04.237 --> 20:06.905
Now, don't tell me              
my son doesn't know comedy.     

20:06.973 --> 20:08.140
             You-You're a pretty
            funny lady yourself.

20:08.208 --> 20:10.509
         Would you like         
to come down and join me?       

20:10.610 --> 20:12.578
Ooh, I'd love that.             
    (cheering and applause)     

20:12.645 --> 20:14.046
Here, hold my purse.            

20:17.417 --> 20:20.152
    Oh, this is so exciting.    

20:20.220 --> 20:22.154
     (giggles)                  

20:24.891 --> 20:28.060
                          CLIFF:
         Oh, yeah, there'll be a
    lawsuit, that's for sure.   

20:28.128 --> 20:29.695
                 In a year, this
                  is going to be

20:29.763 --> 20:31.997
                      the Clavin
        Broadcasting Company.   

20:32.065 --> 20:33.966
        Yep, his name is        
        in the computer.        

20:34.034 --> 20:37.202
      And here's a flash--      
     he's a postal worker.      

20:37.270 --> 20:38.604
    I can take your torture.    

20:38.738 --> 20:40.506
                  I'm not scared
                    of you guys.

20:40.607 --> 20:41.740
(applause over television)      
  My poor mother's out there.   

20:41.808 --> 20:42.875
            CARSON:             
      Thank you very much.      

20:42.942 --> 20:44.877
        She had to watch        
her only son being dragged off. 

20:44.944 --> 20:46.879
     You've probably broken     
    that old woman's spirit.    

20:46.980 --> 20:48.213
    Johnny, I want to give you  
         a little advice.       

20:48.281 --> 20:49.381
                         Mm-hmm.

20:49.449 --> 20:51.216
         When you retire,       
    get dressed every morning.  

20:51.317 --> 20:52.484
  You don't want to sit around  

20:52.619 --> 20:54.353
    all day in your pajamas.    

20:54.421 --> 20:56.221
     You lose some dignity.     
                             Ah,

20:56.289 --> 20:57.856
    thank you, Mrs. Clavin.     

20:57.924 --> 21:00.292
Oh, please,                     
call me Esther.                 

21:00.360 --> 21:03.195
         (whispering):          
    Ma's with Johnny.           

21:03.263 --> 21:06.365
            CARSON:             
  Esther, how did your son get  
this joke on in the first place?

21:06.433 --> 21:08.334
     A friend of Clifford's     
         arranged that.         

21:08.401 --> 21:10.369
            Mm-hmm.             
In fact                         
he's here tonight.              

21:10.437 --> 21:14.273
Norman, come on down,           
and bring my purse.             

21:16.509 --> 21:19.411
     (applause and cheering     
        over television)        

21:26.252 --> 21:28.187
Listen, come on,                
let's get out of here.          

21:28.254 --> 21:30.756
                Ah, in a minute,
              Norm, in a minute.

21:30.857 --> 21:32.891
     Normie, right here...      

21:32.959 --> 21:34.326
                this is where   
             Johnny did my joke.

21:34.394 --> 21:35.594
     Yeah.                      
                (chuckles)      

21:35.695 --> 21:37.529
        Yeah... this is probably
     just the beginning, though.

21:37.597 --> 21:38.797
              I mean, who knows?

21:38.865 --> 21:41.266
      You know, Leno may see it,
        uh, hire me as a writer,

21:41.334 --> 21:45.537
 in a few years, retire himself,
    name me as his successor.   

21:45.605 --> 21:47.906
Come on, Cliffie, let's...      
come on.                        

21:47.974 --> 21:49.408
                Go on, I'll meet
                    you outside.
Come on.                        

21:50.443 --> 21:52.745
        (clears throat)         

21:52.812 --> 21:53.846
     Ladies and gentlemen,      

21:53.913 --> 21:57.282
    he-ere's Cliffie.           

22:03.256 --> 22:05.624
Feels, uh, feels good,          
doesn't it?                     

22:05.725 --> 22:07.259
             (breathing heavily)

22:07.327 --> 22:09.561
          Sure does, Mr. Carson.

22:09.629 --> 22:11.697
Now, get the hell out of here   
before I call security.         

22:13.867 --> 22:18.170
Esther, does Spago's Restaurant 
          sound okay?           

22:18.238 --> 22:21.306
                Nobody knows for
             sure, Woody, but...

22:21.408 --> 22:23.976
             that's what I think
        happens when you die.   

22:26.046 --> 22:28.213
Well, that's great, Sam,        

22:28.281 --> 22:31.917
especially the part about       
the Snickers for breakfast.
