Official business that wasn't
on your agenda, Ada.

14:25.920 --> 14:27.968
An informant told us

14:28.040 --> 14:31.965
that six years ago, Luca Changretta
came from New York to Birmingham

14:32.040 --> 14:33.963
to be best man at his cousin's wedding.

14:34.040 --> 14:36.611

Reid and Dunn on Broadgate

14:36.680 --> 14:37.920
for the photographs.

14:38.000 --> 14:39.729
The photographer kept the negatives.

14:39.800 --> 14:42.167
I persuaded him to give us copies.

14:42.640 --> 14:44.483
And to enlarge this one.

14:46.160 --> 14:49.243
That is Luca Changretta.

TOMMY: I've seen his face,
so I could pick him out.

14:52.120 --> 14:54.805
Half the men in the photograph
are Changrettas,

14:54.880 --> 14:57.884
which means the chances are
they are the men who come to kill us.

14:58.400 --> 15:02.041
We need to get both these photographs
into pubs and on street corners.

15:02.120 --> 15:04.930
Then we put it about
that there's a reward for information.

15:08.200 --> 15:12.922
We also propose that we give a copy
of this photograph to Mr Aberama Gold.

15:13.880 --> 15:18.283
We need to forget the idea that it
has to be Arthur that pulls the trigger.

15:18.360 --> 15:19.805
Tradition willjust fuck us up.

15:20.920 --> 15:22.081
We should wait for Arthur.

15:22.160 --> 15:23.924
Arthur's not here, Ada.

15:24.680 --> 15:28.048
We need Luca Changretta dead. That's it.

John was a good boy.

57:27.360 --> 57:28.771
Arthur tries.

57:30.680 --> 57:32.489
Tommy's different.

57:33.920 --> 57:37.049
You take Tommy.
Spare the rest.

57:42.200 --> 57:43.690
You know,

57:44.880 --> 57:47.406
my mother used to say this about you.

57:49.200 --> 57:51.601
She said,
"That Polly Gray,

57:52.960 --> 57:56.043
"that child would never
let go of a grievance."

58:00.440 --> 58:02.363
And she loves to dance.

58:06.840 --> 58:08.490
What do you say, huh?

58:09.840 --> 58:11.729
You want to dance?

58:17.520 --> 58:19.363
I don't dance any more.

58:21.360 --> 58:23.203
Well, that's a shame.

58:30.680 --> 58:32.284
'Cause you're dancing with me.

58:39.400 --> 58:41.402

with a red right hand #</i>
