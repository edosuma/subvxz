WEBVTT

00:01.502 --> 00:02.673
PREVIOUSLY ON "REVENGE"...

00:02.673 --> 00:04.175
DADDY!
 (Emily) WHEN I WAS A CHILD,

00:04.175 --> 00:06.137
MY FATHER WAS FRAMED
FOR A CRIME HE DIDN'T COMMIT.

00:06.137 --> 00:08.039
YOU'RE MAKING A MISTAKE!
AMANDA!

00:08.039 --> 00:09.340
AMANDA CLARKE
NO LONGER EXISTS.

00:09.340 --> 00:12.012
BEFORE HE DIED,
HE LEFT A ROAD MAP FOR REVENGE

00:12.012 --> 00:14.585
THAT LED ME TO THE PEOPLE
WHO DESTROYED OUR LIVES.

00:14.585 --> 00:16.286
LYDIA'S IN A COMA.

00:16.286 --> 00:18.119
(Conrad) FRANK WAS TRYING
TO KILL HER, VICTORIA.
 (Lydia) AAH!

00:18.119 --> 00:20.020
WHOSE IDEA WAS IT
TO MAKE THE VIDEO?

00:20.020 --> 00:22.393
TELL ME I'M ALONE IN THIS,
AND I WON'T BOTHER YOU AGAIN.

00:22.393 --> 00:25.226
I'M SEEING DANIEL.
I'M SO SORRY, JACK.

00:25.226 --> 00:27.027
GET OFF ME!

00:27.027 --> 00:28.299
UHH!

00:28.299 --> 00:30.131
I THINK WE'RE ALL BEING SET UP.

00:34.034 --> 00:36.107
(Emily) AS HAMLET SAID
TO OPHELIA,

00:36.107 --> 00:38.269
"GOD HAS GIVEN YOU ONE FACE,

00:38.269 --> 00:41.572
AND YOU MAKE YOURSELF ANOTHER."

00:41.572 --> 00:44.675
THE BATTLE BETWEEN
THESE TWO HALVES OF IDENTITY...

00:44.675 --> 00:46.217
(clicks)

00:46.217 --> 00:49.049
WHO WE ARE AND WHO WE PRETEND
TO BE,IS UNWINNABLE.

00:49.049 --> 00:51.051
CONRAD, COULD YOU PLEASE TAKE
VICTORIA'S HAND

00:51.051 --> 00:52.553
IN THIS NEXT SHOT?

00:52.553 --> 00:55.055
AND, VICTORIA, CAN YOU PLEASE
SHOW US THE RING?

00:56.387 --> 00:57.388
(click)

00:57.388 --> 00:59.760
BEAUTIFUL. THANK YOU.

00:59.760 --> 01:02.093
SO IF YOU HAD TO SUM UP YOUR
QUARTER CENTURY OF MARRIAGE,

01:02.093 --> 01:04.165
WHAT EXACTLY WOULD YOU SAY
IS YOUR SECRET?

01:04.165 --> 01:05.495
(click)

01:05.495 --> 01:07.768
WHAT KEEPS YOU TWO TOGETHER?

01:07.768 --> 01:10.201
LOVE AND RESPECT.

01:10.201 --> 01:11.272
MM.

01:11.272 --> 01:12.773
IF YOU KEEP THAT IN MIND,

01:12.773 --> 01:14.505
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE
NOT TO GO THROUGH 25 YEARS

01:14.505 --> 01:16.247
WITHOUT EXPERIENCING
CERTAIN THINGS

01:16.247 --> 01:18.379
THAT BOND YOU

01:18.379 --> 01:20.481
AND MAKE YOU STRONGER.

01:20.481 --> 01:22.683
(click)

01:22.683 --> 01:26.817
WHAT'S THE ONE THING THAT HAS
BONDED YOU TWO FOREVER?

01:26.817 --> 01:30.521
I WOULD SAY THE BIRTH
OF OUR SON DANIEL.

01:30.521 --> 01:32.693
OH, AND CHARLOTTE,
OF COURSE.

01:32.693 --> 01:34.295
(click)

01:34.295 --> 01:36.297
AND YOU'LL BE VERY HAPPY TO HEAR
THAT MY EDITOR

01:36.297 --> 01:39.500
HAS PROMISED ME THE FRONT PAGE
OF THE LIFE & LEISURE SECTION,

01:39.500 --> 01:40.771
ABOVE THE FOLD.

01:40.771 --> 01:41.772
(click)

01:41.772 --> 01:43.274
THE 25th YEAR IN THE MARRIAGE

01:43.274 --> 01:45.806
OF THE HAMPTONS'
MOST PERFECT COUPLE.

01:45.806 --> 01:47.478
(click)
 ASHLEY.

01:47.478 --> 01:49.480
WOULD YOU MIND GIVING
MS. ANDETSON

01:49.480 --> 01:51.182
A TOUR OF THE GARDEN
BEFORE BRUNCH?

01:51.182 --> 01:52.843
OF COURSE.

01:52.843 --> 01:54.515
I'LL BE ALONG
IN JUST A MINUTE.

01:54.515 --> 01:55.686
THANK YOU.

01:55.686 --> 01:57.248
(man) LET'S WRAP IT UP.
LET'S GO.

01:57.248 --> 01:58.819
(woman) OKAY.

01:58.819 --> 02:01.422
THE HAMPTONS'
MOST PERFECT COUPLE.

02:01.422 --> 02:03.424
I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH MORE
OF THIS I CAN STOMACH.

02:03.424 --> 02:06.227
THE TIMING IS...
LESS THAN IDEAL,

02:06.227 --> 02:08.229
BUT THE BEST THING WE CAN DO
IS GO ABOUT OUR LIVES

02:08.229 --> 02:09.800
AS THOUGH NOTHING'S HAPPENED.

02:09.800 --> 02:12.233
SOMETHING HAS HAPPENED.

02:12.233 --> 02:14.265
LYDIA WAS ALMOST KILLED,

02:14.265 --> 02:15.736
AND WE DON'T KNOW WHERE
FRANK IS OR WHAT HE'S UP TO.

02:15.736 --> 02:19.240
WHAT WE DO KNOW IS THAT FRANK
CASHED HIS SEVERANCE CHECK.

02:19.240 --> 02:21.542
HOPEFULLY, THAT MEANS THAT'S
THE LAST WE'VE HEARD OF HIM.

02:21.542 --> 02:24.275
AND WHAT ABOUT LYDIA?

02:24.275 --> 02:26.277
WELL, I STATIONED A GUARD
AT HER BEDSIDE.

02:26.277 --> 02:28.319
AND WHEN SHE WAKES UP,

02:28.319 --> 02:30.321
WE'LL BE THE FIRST
TO KNOW.

02:30.321 --> 02:32.683
(chuckles)

02:32.683 --> 02:34.355
(inhales)

02:45.236 --> 02:46.697
HELLO.

02:48.339 --> 02:50.301
MAY I SEE
SOME IDENTIFICATION?

02:50.301 --> 02:51.302
(Nolan)
IT'S OKAY, BIG ED.

02:51.302 --> 02:53.374
SHE'S JUST A FORMER FRIEND.

02:53.374 --> 02:56.347
OH, YOU CAN TAKE FIVE,

02:56.347 --> 02:59.410
JUST DON'T GO TOO FAR.

03:01.652 --> 03:03.354
YOU HIRED A BODYGUARD?

03:03.354 --> 03:06.357
YOU WOULD, TOO, IF FRANK HAD
ALMOST BLOWN YOUR KNEECAPS OFF.

03:06.357 --> 03:08.759
BUT AS PECULIAR
AS IT MAY SOUND,

03:08.759 --> 03:10.221
I HAPPEN TO LIKE MY LIFE.

03:10.221 --> 03:12.263
OH, AND SO DID MY FATHER,

03:12.263 --> 03:13.664
UNTIL THE GRAYSONS STOLE IT.

03:13.664 --> 03:15.366
WHERE'S YOUR LOYALTY
TO HIM?

03:15.366 --> 03:16.867
PERHAPS I COULD STEP BACK

03:16.867 --> 03:19.300
INTO MORE
OF A CONSULTING ROLE.

03:19.300 --> 03:20.571
FINE.

03:20.571 --> 03:22.933
I NEED YOU TO HACK INTO
THE HOSPITAL'S COMPUTER FILES.

03:22.933 --> 03:24.305
LYDIA'S OUT OF
CRITICAL CONDITION,

03:24.305 --> 03:25.536
BUT SHE'S STILL COMATOSE.

03:25.536 --> 03:27.338
I COULDN'T HELP MYSELF.

03:27.338 --> 03:28.879
GOOD.

03:28.879 --> 03:31.242
THAT BUYS US SOME TIME
TO GET BACK ON TRACK.

03:31.242 --> 03:32.883
AND WHAT HORRIBLE FATE
DO YOU HAVE IN STORE

03:32.883 --> 03:34.385
FOR YOUNG DANIEL?

03:34.385 --> 03:35.886
DANIEL'S NOT A TARGET.

03:35.886 --> 03:37.418
YOU KNOW THAT.
 HMM.

03:37.418 --> 03:39.520
YOU KNOW HOW MUCH EASIER
YOUR LIFE WOULD BE

03:39.520 --> 03:42.222
IF YOU JUST DROPPED ALL THIS

03:42.222 --> 03:45.556
AND WENT TO GO LIVE
HAPPILY EVER AFTER

03:45.556 --> 03:47.658
WITH JACK?

03:47.658 --> 03:49.360
UNLESS...

03:49.360 --> 03:51.632
OF COURSE...

03:51.632 --> 03:54.435
YOU'RE ACTUALLY
FALLING FOR DANIEL?

03:54.435 --> 03:55.936
(sighs)

03:55.936 --> 03:58.609
YOU'RE JUST A CONSULTANT,
REMEMBER?

04:02.613 --> 04:05.616
SO WHICH PARENT
SPOILS YOU THE MOST?

04:05.616 --> 04:07.348
EASY. MY DAD.

04:07.348 --> 04:08.949
(chuckles)
THAT'S AN UNDERSTATEMENT.

04:08.949 --> 04:10.020
(all laugh)

04:10.020 --> 04:11.452
AND WHAT ABOUT YOUR BROTHER?

04:11.452 --> 04:13.554
IS THERE ANY
SIBLING RIVALRY THERE?

04:13.554 --> 04:15.726
MY BROTHER
GETS AWAY WITH MURDER.

04:15.726 --> 04:18.689
NOTICE HIS ABSENCE
THIS MORNING?

04:18.689 --> 04:20.029
MM. HE REALLY SHOULD'VE
BEEN HERE BY NOW.

04:20.029 --> 04:21.531
I CAN'T IMAGINE
WHAT'S KEEPING HIM.

04:21.531 --> 04:23.033
DANIEL'S BEEN DOING
SOME CHARITY WORK

04:23.033 --> 04:25.466
DOWN AT THE DOCKS
IN MONTAUK.

04:25.466 --> 04:28.299
TYLER BARROL,
DANIEL'S HARVARD FRIEND.

04:28.299 --> 04:30.471
MELISSA ANDETSON.
WITH THE "TIMES."

04:30.471 --> 04:32.473
TYLER'S BEEN STAYING
WITH US FOR THE SUMMER.

04:32.473 --> 04:34.905
IN FACT, HE'S PRACTICALLY
A MEMBER OF THE FAMILY.

04:34.905 --> 04:36.707
(all chuckle)
 YOU SHOULD REALLY COME

04:36.707 --> 04:38.549
TO THE ANNIVERSARY DINNER
TOMORROW NIGHT.

04:38.549 --> 04:39.850
OF COURSE.

04:39.850 --> 04:41.412
SO YOU'RE GOING TO BE HAVING
AN INTIMATE DINNER

04:41.412 --> 04:43.884
RATHER THAN ONE OF
YOUR LEGENDARY SOIREES?

04:43.884 --> 04:46.457
OH, WELL, IT'S BECOME KIND OF
A TRADITION ON ITS OWN,

04:46.457 --> 04:48.589
JUST CLOSE FRIENDS
AND FAMILY.

04:48.589 --> 04:52.923
NOT TO OVERSTEP, BUT MAY I
BRING ASHLEY AS MY DATE?

04:52.923 --> 04:54.495
OH, TYLER,
I'M SURE THE GRAYSONS

04:54.495 --> 04:56.367
ALREADY HAVE ENOUGH PEOPLE.

04:56.367 --> 04:58.399
MM. IT'S A LOVELY IDEA.

04:58.399 --> 04:59.570
(Charlotte) GREAT.

04:59.570 --> 05:01.301
THEN I'LL BRING
A DATE, TOO.

05:01.301 --> 05:03.974
LAST I HEARD, YOU AND ADAM
HAD BROKEN UP.

05:03.974 --> 05:06.377
LET'S KEEP IT TO TRADITION.

05:16.847 --> 05:18.989
HEY, BUD.

05:18.989 --> 05:21.452
WELL, LOOK WHAT
THE CAT DRAGGED IN.

05:21.452 --> 05:23.454
YOUR MOTHER
IS READY TO KILL YOU.

05:23.454 --> 05:25.325
SHE'S NOT ALONE,
BY THE WAY.

05:25.325 --> 05:26.997
I KNOW. I KNOW. I GOT
THIS STUPID INTERVIEW,

05:26.997 --> 05:28.499
WHICH I...

05:28.499 --> 05:30.361
HOLD ON.

05:30.361 --> 05:31.832
WHY ARE YOU MAD AT ME?

05:31.832 --> 05:34.465
(sighs) YOU HONESTLY
DON'T REMEMBER?

05:34.465 --> 05:36.707
OH, MY GOD.

05:36.707 --> 05:37.908
DID I DO THAT?

05:37.908 --> 05:39.840
YOU SLAMMED MY HEAD
INTO A WALL, DANNY.

05:39.840 --> 05:41.372
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

05:41.372 --> 05:44.114
T-TY, I-I DON'T REMEMBER
A THING FROM LAST NIGHT.

05:44.114 --> 05:46.477
WHAT--WHAT HAPPENED?
 WELL, APPARENTLY, I CAN'T
MENTION EMILY'S NAME

05:46.477 --> 05:48.519
WITHOUT YOU GOING BALLISTIC
ON ME.

05:48.519 --> 05:50.621
WHAT ABOUT ME?

05:50.621 --> 05:52.983
NOTHING. NOTHING.
ROUGH NIGHT.

05:52.983 --> 05:54.785
SO I HEARD.

05:54.785 --> 05:56.657
IS THAT WHY YOU'VE BEEN
IGNORING MY CALLS?

05:56.657 --> 06:00.030
(Daniel) I'M SORRY. THE NIGHT
KIND OF GOT AWAY FROM ME,

06:00.030 --> 06:02.593
AND I ENDED UP CRASHING AT WORK.
 (beep)

06:02.593 --> 06:04.865
COULD WE GET
A LITTLE PRIVACY, TYLER?

06:04.865 --> 06:06.697
YEAH, OF COURSE.

06:06.697 --> 06:07.868
(cell phone rings)

06:07.868 --> 06:09.700
AH, PERFECT TIMING.

06:09.700 --> 06:11.442
HEY, MOM. HOW'S RIO?

06:11.442 --> 06:12.803
I'M SORRY.

06:12.803 --> 06:14.475
THE "TIMES" IS DOING A PROFILE
OF MY MOM AND DAD,

06:14.475 --> 06:16.647
AND I GOTTA SIT DOWN
WITH THE REPORTER.

06:16.647 --> 06:18.779
HEY, WHY DON'T YOU JOIN ME?
 MM.

06:18.779 --> 06:20.881
I HATE THESE THINGS.
 NO MORE THAN I DO.

06:20.881 --> 06:23.654
I'VE NEVER TRUSTED REPORTERS.
THEY CAN...

06:23.654 --> 06:25.486
twist your words to sell
any story they want.

06:25.486 --> 06:26.487
(Daniel) Mm-hmm.

06:26.487 --> 06:27.818
CALL YOU WHEN IT'S OVER.

06:27.818 --> 06:29.089
MM.

06:29.089 --> 06:31.622
If it's okay, I'd rather
you not mention me.

06:31.622 --> 06:34.024
Yeah. No problem.

06:50.641 --> 06:52.813
(Frank)
YOU LOOKING FOR THIS?

06:55.916 --> 06:58.949
THIS IS SOME SERIOUS FIREPOWER,
MS. THORNE.

07:01.552 --> 07:03.594
SEEMS UNNECESSARY.

07:03.594 --> 07:05.856
WELL, THAT DEPENDS ON
WHAT I'M UP AGAINST.

07:05.856 --> 07:07.598
YOU WORK FOR THE GRAYSONS,
DON'T YOU?

07:07.598 --> 07:09.429
NO, NOT ANYMORE.

07:09.429 --> 07:11.431
LOST MY JOB...

07:11.431 --> 07:14.004
DUE TO SOME STRANGE EVENTS.

07:14.004 --> 07:15.666
THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF THAT
GOING AROUND

07:15.666 --> 07:17.167
SINCE YOU CAME TO TOWN--

07:17.167 --> 07:18.669
YOU AND YOUR PAL
NOLAN ROSS.

07:18.669 --> 07:21.812
YOU SHOULD LEAVE
BEFORE I CALL THE POLICE.

07:23.544 --> 07:25.175
GO AHEAD.

07:26.677 --> 07:27.948
THOUGH I SUSPECT

07:27.948 --> 07:29.720
THAT YOU DON'T WANT 'EM
NOSING AROUND, DO YOU?

07:29.720 --> 07:32.953
TWO YEARS AT
ALLENWOOD JUVENILE DETENTION,

07:32.953 --> 07:35.626
CONVICTION FOR ASSAULT
WITH A DEADLY WEAPON.

07:35.626 --> 07:36.927
THOSE FILES WERE SEALED.

07:36.927 --> 07:39.229
AT GREAT EXPENSE,
NO DOUBT.

07:39.229 --> 07:40.761
I WAS JUST A KID.

07:40.761 --> 07:42.563
I'M NOT THAT GIRL ANYMORE.

07:42.563 --> 07:43.934
WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT?

07:43.934 --> 07:45.596
YOU CAN CLEAN YOURSELF UP,

07:45.596 --> 07:48.539
BUT ZEBRAS
DON'T CHANGE THEIR STRIPES.

07:48.539 --> 07:51.471
HOW MUCH DO YOU WANT?

07:51.471 --> 07:54.875
YEAH, IT'S ALWAYS ABOUT MONEY
WITH YOU PEOPLE, ISN'T IT?

07:54.875 --> 07:59.049
AT FIRST, I THOUGHT VICTORIA
WAS JUST PARANOID ABOUT YOU,

07:59.049 --> 08:01.051
BUT NOT ANYMORE.

08:01.051 --> 08:04.214
THERE'S MORE TO YOUR STORY,
LITTLE LADY.

08:04.214 --> 08:07.487
AND I'M GONNA FIND OUT
WHAT IT IS.

08:14.595 --> 08:16.226
(keys clink)

08:25.175 --> 08:29.179
(dialing)

08:29.179 --> 08:30.510
(telephone rings)

08:30.510 --> 08:32.511
(ring)

08:32.511 --> 08:34.544
(click)

08:34.544 --> 08:37.618
(man) Warden, I have
Amanda Clarke on the line.

08:41.592 --> 08:42.993
AMANDA.

08:42.993 --> 08:45.556
I WAS HOPING NEVER
TO HAVE TO TAKE THIS CALL.

08:45.556 --> 08:48.528
I was hoping I'd never
have to make it.

08:48.528 --> 08:51.632
BUT I HAVE A FEELING
I'M GONNA NEED YOUR HELP...

08:51.632 --> 08:56.737
AGAIN.

08:56.737 --> 08:59.740
♪♪♪

09:08.579 --> 09:09.920
AND FUNNILY ENOUGH, I'M ACTUALLY
ENJOYING IT. (chuckles)

09:09.920 --> 09:12.623
BARTENDING? REALLY?

09:12.623 --> 09:13.924
YEAH,
IT'S BEEN REALLY HUMBLING.

09:13.924 --> 09:15.255
THE FAMILY
THAT OWNS THE STOWAWAY

09:15.255 --> 09:17.257
HAVE POURED THEIR HEARTS
AND SOULS INTO THE BUSINESS.

09:17.257 --> 09:19.559
I'VE GOT NOTHING
BUT RESPECT FOR THEM.

09:19.559 --> 09:21.231
YOU KNOW, DANIEL, I WAS
REREADING THE INTERVIEW

09:21.231 --> 09:22.763
THAT WE DID LAST SUMMER.

09:22.763 --> 09:24.765
YOU WERE
QUITE THE PARTY BOY THEN.

09:24.765 --> 09:27.798
UGH. YOU KNOW,
PEOPLE CHANGE.

09:27.798 --> 09:29.139
I'VE CHANGED,

09:29.139 --> 09:31.571
AND JUST IN TIME.

09:31.571 --> 09:32.703
IN TIME FOR WHAT?

09:32.703 --> 09:33.874
(sighs) I...

09:33.874 --> 09:35.706

39:35.804 --> 39:37.746
YEAH, I, UH...

39:37.746 --> 39:39.808
I HUNG IT IN MY CLOSET
TO REMIND ME

39:39.808 --> 39:41.850
THAT UNPREDICTABLE MOMENTS
CAN CHANGE YOUR LIFE

39:41.850 --> 39:44.112
IF YOU'RE READY FOR THEM.

39:47.686 --> 39:49.658
I'M READY.

39:53.962 --> 39:56.094
I'M FALLING IN LOVE
WITH YOU, TOO.

40:09.978 --> 40:12.981
JUST AS THERE ARE TWO SIDES
TO EVERY STORY,

40:12.981 --> 40:16.585
THERE ARE TWO SIDES
TO EVERY PERSON.

40:23.051 --> 40:25.454
ONE THAT WE REVEAL
TO THE WORLD,

40:25.454 --> 40:29.157
AND ANOTHER
WE KEEP HIDDEN INSIDE.

40:29.157 --> 40:30.699
A DUALITY GOVERNED

40:30.699 --> 40:34.032
BY THE BALANCE
OF LIGHT AND DARKNESS.

40:34.032 --> 40:35.734
(groans)

40:35.734 --> 40:39.568
(monitor beeping steadily)

40:40.609 --> 40:42.110
(groans)

40:44.012 --> 40:46.174
CONRAD.

40:55.183 --> 40:57.185
WITHIN EACH OF US
IS THE CAPACITY

40:57.185 --> 41:00.028
FOR BOTH GOOD AND EVIL.

41:00.028 --> 41:02.591
(knock on door)

41:02.591 --> 41:04.793
BUT THOSE WHO ARE ABLE TO BLUR
THE MORAL DIVIDING LINE

41:04.793 --> 41:07.566
HOLD THE TRUE POWER.

41:09.197 --> 41:11.670
(voice breaks) OH, GOD.
IT'S REALLY YOU.

41:17.646 --> 41:19.708
AMANDA CLARKE?

41:24.653 --> 41:26.815
THE WAY THEY'VE BEEN
TALKING ABOUT YOU,

41:26.815 --> 41:28.917
I EXPECTED SOMEONE...

41:28.917 --> 41:30.619
BIGGER.

41:31.890 --> 41:34.963
NOT AFRAID OF ME?

41:34.963 --> 41:35.964
(grunts)

41:35.964 --> 41:37.596
YOU SHOULD BE.

41:37.596 --> 41:38.767
(grunts)

41:38.767 --> 41:40.028
(both grunt)

41:40.028 --> 41:41.530
(pants)

41:41.530 --> 41:43.932
(pants) YOU OBVIOUSLY
KNOW WHO I AM.

41:43.932 --> 41:45.674
WHO ARE YOU?

41:45.674 --> 41:47.005
EMILY.

41:47.005 --> 41:48.537
EMILY WHAT?

41:48.537 --> 41:49.708
EMILY THORNE.

41:49.708 --> 41:51.680
WE'VE GOT A PROBLEM.

41:51.680 --> 41:54.042
SOME GUY NAMED FRANK
FIGURED OUT WE SWITCHED NAMES.

41:54.042 --> 41:55.744
WHERE IS HE?

41:55.744 --> 41:58.146
DON'T WORRY.
I TOOK CARE OF HIM.

41:58.146 --> 41:59.748
(cell phone rings)
 THIS IS HIS PHONE.

41:59.748 --> 42:01.890
VICTORIA GRAYSON
KEEPS CALLING.

42:01.890 --> 42:04.092
(grunts)

42:04.092 --> 42:06.795
(ring)

42:06.795 --> 42:08.827
You've reached Frank.
Leave a message.

42:08.827 --> 42:10.058
(beep)

42:10.058 --> 42:12.861
Frank, it's Victoria.

42:12.861 --> 42:14.663
You officially have me worried.

42:14.663 --> 42:17.836
Please call me back
as soon as you get this.

42:17.836 --> 42:21.009
What do you mean Emily Thorne
is not who she claims to be?
