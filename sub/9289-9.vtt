00:13.957 --> 00:15.333
Tell me about Ron Wieland.

00:15.417 --> 00:18.378
- He's going public with the rumour.
- About the bomb?

00:18.461 --> 00:22.841
We're holding him at the OC.
When the crisis passes I'll let him go.

00:22.924 --> 00:24.300
You better come out here.

00:24.384 --> 00:26.719
What I find most troubling is that

00:26.803 --> 00:30.640
our president knows about this threat
and is saying nothing.

00:30.723 --> 00:34.060
- Who was controlling that room?
- Armus.

00:34.144 --> 00:35.395
I want to see him now.

00:37.230 --> 00:38.773
Kim, I'm scared!

00:38.857 --> 00:41.776
Where are you taking her?
She can't go back to LA.

00:41.860 --> 00:44.279
I checked you out.
Your father does work for CTU.

00:44.362 --> 00:48.658
Now you tell me, what did he tell you
was gonna happen today in LA?

00:48.742 --> 00:50.785
It's a nuclear bomb.

00:52.620 --> 00:55.123
What's my father's connection to all this?

00:55.206 --> 00:59.335
He wrote a cheque to Syed Ali for $475,000

00:59.419 --> 01:01.671
in return for consulting services.

01:01.755 --> 01:03.339
Maybe they were doing business.

01:03.423 --> 01:06.468
Syed Ali's only business
is bankrolling terrorists.

01:06.968 --> 01:11.181
I'm a consultant for the CIA.

01:18.271 --> 01:19.314
Let's go!

01:21.149 --> 01:24.527
Nina, how big is the bomb?

01:25.779 --> 01:26.946
What did he tell you?

01:27.030 --> 01:28.990
- Everything.
- No!

01:30.366 --> 01:31.409
We're losing him!

01:31.493 --> 01:33.870
- Jack...
- Secure her!

01:33.953 --> 01:35.497
I know where the bomb is.

01:51.513 --> 01:56.601
I was illegally detained inside the
president's retreat for the last six hours.

01:56.684 --> 01:59.896
That tells you how much he did not
want this information come out.

01:59.979 --> 02:01.106
No, Karen.

02:01.189 --> 02:04.192
- That does me no good.
- What am I looking for?

02:04.275 --> 02:08.405
Wieland has a source inside of this
administration, and I need to know who.

02:08.488 --> 02:10.615
- I'm on it.
- Fine.

02:10.698 --> 02:13.952
Then you get back to me with that. OK.

02:14.035 --> 02:17.372
No, I need the information. Good.

02:20.667 --> 02:22.961
- What's going on?
- You tell me.

02:23.044 --> 02:27.382
- What does that mean?
- Wieland's been contained for six hours.

02:27.465 --> 02:29.884
After you met with him,
someone let him out.

02:29.968 --> 02:32.053
And you think it was me?

02:33.138 --> 02:36.683
Even if I had the resources, which I don't,

02:36.766 --> 02:41.312
why in God's name would I want to see
Wieland cause a panic, especially today?

02:41.396 --> 02:46.317
- I don't know.
- David, I had nothing to do with this.

02:47.402 --> 02:50.822
I swear on the lives of our children!

02:52.365 --> 02:54.617
Mr President...

02:54.701 --> 02:56.536
Wait here.

03:00.498 --> 03:04.085
You find Armus yet?
I wanna know how Wieland got past him.

03:04.169 --> 03:06.254
Take a look.

03:07.297 --> 03:09.340
What's this?

03:09.424 --> 03:12.635
A digital playback from
the surveillance feeds at OC.

03:12.719 --> 03:15.513
That's Armus.

03:15.597 --> 03:18.057
This happened 25 minutes ago.

03:22.437 --> 03:24.731
- Armus let him out?
- Yeah.

03:25.899 --> 03:27.901
- Where is he?
- We haven't found him.

03:27.984 --> 03:31.654
Mr President, if Armus is
working covertly against you...

03:31.738 --> 03:34.365
It's not covert now! It's in my face!

03:34.449 --> 03:37.368
- We will find him, sir.
- We'd better.

03:37.452 --> 03:41.664
Because whomever he's working for
is trying to keep me from finding this bomb!

03:52.217 --> 03:55.345
- How long till we go down?
- Any minute.

03:55.428 --> 04:00.308
The pilots found us a place to crash land.
I've gotta get the coordinates to George.

04:10.735 --> 04:13.071
- George?
- Jack, what's happening?

04:13.154 --> 04:16.408
We're going down.
The pilots don't know what's going on.

04:16.491 --> 04:20.536
It felt like some kind of explosion.
We're losing all kinds of power.

04:20.620 --> 04:23.164
They think they can make
a safe crash landing

04:23.248 --> 04:26.543
on a soft riverbed located in sector J.

04:26.626 --> 04:30.922
The coordinates are 34-30-44 north,

04:31.005 --> 04:34.050
119-0-niner-0-5 west.

04:34.134 --> 04:36.344
- Did you get that?
- Yeah, we got it.

04:37.303 --> 04:40.890
Nina, there's a chance we're
not gonna make it through this.

04:40.974 --> 04:44.102
We need to know the location
of the bomb now!

04:47.564 --> 04:50.775
We've given you everything
you've asked for! Please!

04:50.859 --> 04:51.901
Can she hear me?

04:51.985 --> 04:54.404
Hold on, I'll put you on speaker.

04:56.781 --> 05:00.660
Nina, you got your pardon from the
president. What more do you want?

05:00.744 --> 05:03.621
Even if I survive this,
Jack's gonna kill me.

05:03.705 --> 05:07.834
- Phillips is there to protect you.
- He can't protect me from Jack!

05:07.917 --> 05:12.172
Nina, all I want is the
location of the bomb.

05:13.298 --> 05:17.051
I give you my word,
I will not harm you in any way!

05:17.135 --> 05:18.762
I don't believe you!

05:20.513 --> 05:23.433
- Where is the bomb?
- Rick, holster your weapon!

05:23.516 --> 05:27.812
- Do one last good thing with your life!
- Phillips, what is going on?

05:27.896 --> 05:31.232
Phillips, that's an order! Take your seat!

05:35.862 --> 05:39.866
This is the captain. We're not
going to make it to the riverbed.

05:39.949 --> 05:43.828
Everyone assume crash position
and get ready for impact.

05:47.082 --> 05:50.668
George, we're going down!
We're not gonna make the riverbed.

05:50.752 --> 05:54.172
The coordinates I gave you,
they're going to be off...

06:03.598 --> 06:09.104
Get the crash-site coordinates from ATC
and send in search and rescue.

06:09.187 --> 06:12.148
ATC, this is CTU.
I need the exact coordinates.

06:13.817 --> 06:18.154
I'll prepare a statement in the next hour.
In the meantime, let's find Armus.

06:18.238 --> 06:19.781
Yes, sir.

06:34.129 --> 06:38.883
Sherry... I owe you an apology.

06:40.510 --> 06:43.471
Why? What did Mike say to you?

06:43.555 --> 06:46.099
Richard Armus was the one
who let Wieland go.

06:46.182 --> 06:50.395
But Armus doesn't have his own agenda.
He must be working for someone else.

06:50.478 --> 06:52.564
We're looking into it now.

06:53.857 --> 06:56.443
I'm sorry I jumped to the wrong conclusion.

06:59.237 --> 07:00.739
It's all right.

07:00.822 --> 07:07.162
I don't expect you to change
your attitude towards me overnight.

07:07.954 --> 07:09.831
Apology accepted.

07:12.375 --> 07:14.461
David...

07:16.671 --> 07:18.882
What are you gonna do?

07:18.965 --> 07:21.050
Talk to the press.

07:21.134 --> 07:26.097
I'm not sure how, but I may have to
go after Ron's credibility.

07:27.974 --> 07:29.851
- Ron's credibility?
- Yes.

07:29.934 --> 07:32.437
Make it look like his report was motivated

07:32.520 --> 07:36.441
by personal dislike,
that it's not based in fact.

07:36.524 --> 07:39.402
Yes, but it is based in fact.

07:39.486 --> 07:43.073
- Believe me, I wish there was another way.
- Maybe there is.

07:46.618 --> 07:51.623
Why don't you just tell the truth, David?
It's what you do best.

07:52.207 --> 07:56.961
I mean, you pulled it off with Keith,
with our divorce.

07:57.045 --> 08:00.548
You've earned the public's trust.
Just use it.

08:03.760 --> 08:05.845
What?

08:06.805 --> 08:10.141
I'm just wondering if you've really changed,

08:10.225 --> 08:13.728
or if you've just gotten
better at pretending.

08:13.812 --> 08:16.898
- Sir?
- Yes, what is it?

08:16.981 --> 08:20.026
We just got word from CTU in Los Angeles.

08:20.110 --> 08:24.114
The plane Jack Bauer was returning in
just went down.

08:24.197 --> 08:25.657
It crashed?

08:25.740 --> 08:28.618
We're still waiting for details.

08:28.701 --> 08:30.453
Oh, my God!

09:34.517 --> 09:36.770
Rick. Rick!

09:38.480 --> 09:40.190
Rick!

09:55.080 --> 09:57.123
Myers...

09:57.207 --> 10:00.293
I haven't found her.
I don't even know if she made it.

10:00.376 --> 10:03.004
Find her...

10:03.088 --> 10:06.174
I'm gonna find her. You gotta hang in there.

10:10.428 --> 10:13.765
Hang in there. Search and rescue
will be here any minute.

10:13.848 --> 10:17.018
Just hang in there. I'll be right back.

11:05.525 --> 11:07.485
Come on, come on.

12:02.457 --> 12:07.128
These images were taken around the time
the pilot reported the explosion.

12:11.925 --> 12:15.804
- They were shot down.
- By some kind of ground-to-air missile.

12:19.307 --> 12:23.770
Compile a list of anybody that might
have had access to their flight plan.

12:23.853 --> 12:29.776
If Nina didn't die in the crash,
whoever it was will want to finish the job.

12:29.859 --> 12:32.195
I have search and rescue scrambling now.

12:32.278 --> 12:36.074
Make sure they're well armed.
Get me their ETA as soon as you have it.

12:38.493 --> 12:43.331
George, Richards told me you had Warner
and Naiyeer transferred to room seven.

12:43.415 --> 12:46.209
- That's right.
- I separated them for a reason.

12:46.292 --> 12:51.089
It's not working, so let's put them together
and play them off each other.

12:51.172 --> 12:54.092
One minute you're trying
to save your own ass,

12:54.175 --> 12:56.886
then you act like you give
a damn about anybody...

12:56.970 --> 12:59.431
- Back off!
- No, I'm not gonna back off.

12:59.514 --> 13:02.809
Not today. Now, what's going on?

13:06.688 --> 13:09.899
Remember the warehouse
in Panorama City?

13:09.983 --> 13:13.528
Weapons-grade plutonium,
airborne in the fire fight.

13:13.611 --> 13:16.448
- You were exposed?
- Yeah.

13:17.282 --> 13:20.910
Said I'd be lucky
if I made it through tomorrow.

13:23.621 --> 13:26.332
I don't know what to say, George.

13:28.126 --> 13:30.211
I'm sorry.

13:31.129 --> 13:32.964
Me too.

13:34.924 --> 13:37.093
Does anybody else know about this?

13:37.177 --> 13:41.306
Just Jack. You. Can we keep it that way?

13:44.309 --> 13:48.480
Do you need anything?
Is there something I can do?

13:48.563 --> 13:52.776
Just do you job. Let me do mine.

14:11.294 --> 14:13.713
So you both claim not to know Syed Ali.

14:13.797 --> 14:16.674
- It's not a claim. It's the truth.
- Sit down.

14:16.758 --> 14:19.427
- I'd rather stand.
- Sit down!

14:26.726 --> 14:30.563
Where the hell do you think you are?
Wake up!

14:31.356 --> 14:36.194
A cache of weapons-grade plutonium was
found in a warehouse in Panorama City!

14:36.277 --> 14:40.365
A nuclear weapon was assembled there
and it's set to be detonated today.

14:40.448 --> 14:41.658
A nuclear bomb?

14:41.741 --> 14:46.329
We also found this in the warehouse.
What do you make of that, guys?

14:53.420 --> 14:55.839
This is a bill of lading from our company.

14:55.922 --> 14:58.425
For a container sent to Syed Ali,

14:58.508 --> 15:02.303
which means at least one of you
is lying right now.

15:02.387 --> 15:05.598
I'll let you two work that out
between yourselves.

15:06.808 --> 15:10.562
Whoever talks first gets immunity.

15:10.645 --> 15:14.774
It's a one-time offer.
It expires in ten minutes.

15:22.699 --> 15:26.494
- They're gonna come for us soon.
- What's taking them so long?

15:26.578 --> 15:28.663
I don't know, but they'll be here.

15:30.665 --> 15:33.501
- We're leaving soon.
- Where are we going?

15:33.585 --> 15:37.005
- Central booking.
- LAPD? That's downtown.

15:37.088 --> 15:39.174
- I know where it is.
- Aw, man.

15:39.257 --> 15:41.676
What did I tell you? I don't believe this.

15:41.760 --> 15:45.638
Someone from CTU is supposed to pick
us up. Can you call George Mason?

15:45.722 --> 15:48.933
Captain says it's out of their jurisdiction.

15:49.017 --> 15:52.061
Look, you're both suspects
in a capital crime.

15:52.145 --> 15:55.148
- We told you why we can't go back to LA.
- The bomb.

15:56.107 --> 15:57.817
- Yes.
- I checked it.

15:57.901 --> 16:01.362
There's been no departmental alert
or elevated threat status.

16:01.446 --> 16:04.657
They do not want the entire city
to panic at once.

16:04.741 --> 16:08.536
Do you think we're making this up?
Call CTU. They'll tell you.

16:08.620 --> 16:11.122
I'm a cop. I have my orders, OK?

16:13.291 --> 16:16.503
I'll sign you two out
before I take you back to the city.

16:19.172 --> 16:22.554
I don't believe this.
We can't go back to LA.

16:22.954 --> 16:25.303
When my dad finds out, he'll fix things.

16:25.386 --> 16:28.223
We shouldn't be counting on your father.

16:28.306 --> 16:33.853
No offense, but you were right
when you said how messed up he is.

16:33.937 --> 16:37.148
Everything I've said about my father
is because I was angry

16:37.232 --> 16:40.193
and I blamed him for
what happened to my mom.

16:40.276 --> 16:42.987
- Maybe you were right.
- No.

16:43.071 --> 16:46.825
No, listen, it wasn't his fault,
and he did the best he could.

16:49.244 --> 16:51.413
It just all turned out wrong.

16:55.542 --> 16:58.503
No, this is crazy.

17:01.548 --> 17:04.843
How can they keep us here
without letting us see a lawyer?

17:07.345 --> 17:09.222
Huh?

17:10.473 --> 17:12.767
- What are we gonna do?
- Nothing.

17:12.851 --> 17:15.854
Because nothing we say
will make any difference.

17:15.936 --> 17:18.314
They'll make it look like we're involved.

17:18.397 --> 17:20.887
With a nuclear bomb?
I've done anything wrong!

17:20.977 --> 17:24.028
This is crazy! I have nothing to hide!

17:28.783 --> 17:32.495
- What about you, Bob?
- What about me?

17:33.663 --> 17:37.876
- You got anything to hide?
- Of course not. No.

17:37.959 --> 17:40.044
You made the authorisation to Ali.

17:40.128 --> 17:42.672
- No, I didn't.
- Then who did?

17:42.756 --> 17:46.009
Don't interrogate me.
That's exactly what they want.

17:46.092 --> 17:49.596
Yeah? I'm not asking for them.

17:51.639 --> 17:53.975
If you didn't make the authorisation...

17:54.058 --> 17:58.396
Naiyeer's levels are even.
Warner's spiking all over.

17:58.480 --> 18:04.235
They also said...
that you work for the CIA.

18:05.820 --> 18:11.034
I let the CIA pass information through
our distribution network a couple of times.

18:11.117 --> 18:13.119
- That's it.
- Why didn't you tell me?

18:13.203 --> 18:17.957
- Because it is none of your concern!
- I think it concerns me now!

18:18.041 --> 18:22.504
I think a nuclear bomb pretty much
concerns everyone! Don't you?

18:27.008 --> 18:29.219
You know what I'm thinking, Bob?

18:30.678 --> 18:34.682
I'm thinking that all your generosity

18:34.766 --> 18:38.103
and acceptance is just a load of crap.

18:39.771 --> 18:42.315
Reza, you better sit down and shut up

18:42.398 --> 18:47.070
before you say something you will
regret for the rest of your life.

18:48.113 --> 18:50.198
You lied to me.

19:06.131 --> 19:07.966
I can track the shipping order!

19:08.049 --> 19:12.637
Bob's code signature will show that
he authorised the transaction order!

19:12.720 --> 19:16.099
- Get off of me.
- No, just stop it.

19:18.852 --> 19:22.772
The database is at the office.
I'll take you there.

19:22.856 --> 19:25.358
Step outside.

19:25.442 --> 19:29.779
- I'm not taking the fall for you, Bob.
- Come on. Take it easy.

19:31.573 --> 19:33.450
All right, all right.

19:49.382 --> 19:52.260
- Hey, where's George?
- With Naiyeer. He broke.

19:53.636 --> 19:58.224
Could you tell him the search and rescue
is about 12 minutes from the crash site?

19:58.308 --> 20:00.018
OK.

20:00.101 --> 20:02.604
- Tony.
- Yeah?

20:03.855 --> 20:06.941
- What's going on with George?
- As far as what?

20:07.025 --> 20:09.235
He's sick, isn't he?

20:11.404 --> 20:15.492
He's got some kind of
radiation poisoning, doesn't he?

20:15.575 --> 20:17.660
Where'd you get that?

20:19.162 --> 20:24.000
Hazmat's all over the warehouse he
raided this morning, so it's gotta be hot.

20:24.084 --> 20:28.630
His nose was bleeding, and Shipler told me
he was throwing up in the bathroom.

20:28.713 --> 20:31.549
And it doesn't take a
doctor to figure it out.

20:33.093 --> 20:36.387
Besides, I can read your face
pretty well by now.

20:39.933 --> 20:44.062
Look, he doesn't want
anybody else to know, OK?

20:44.145 --> 20:47.023
- How bad?
- Pretty bad.

20:49.776 --> 20:52.445
Can he run things in his condition.

20:52.529 --> 20:55.490
- Yeah, I think so.
- That's not good enough.

20:55.573 --> 20:58.910
If he's compromised mentally
or physically, we can't...

20:58.993 --> 21:00.578
He can do his job, Michelle.

21:00.662 --> 21:05.041
He wants to do his job like I've never seen.
He's determined to stop this bomb.

21:05.125 --> 21:08.503
So am I, which is why I think
he should step down.

21:08.586 --> 21:14.342
I'll keep an eye on him. And the second he
misses a step, I'll make sure he backs off.

21:14.426 --> 21:19.681
- No, you can't baby-sit him.
- I'm not baby-sitting him, Michelle.

21:19.764 --> 21:22.350
Now, you gotta trust me on this.

21:28.731 --> 21:31.860
Can I see that information
as soon as you get it?

21:31.943 --> 21:34.654
I made some notes on David's speech.

21:34.738 --> 21:37.824
I thought maybe you might
want to incorporate them.

21:37.907 --> 21:40.994
I haven't even shown that
to the president yet.

21:41.077 --> 21:44.164
- Jenny showed me a draft.
- She shouldn't have.

21:44.247 --> 21:48.209
She's known me for a long time, Lynne.
She knows what I have to offer.

21:49.711 --> 21:52.297
Mrs Palmer, the president believes

21:52.380 --> 21:56.092
that you can be an asset to him
during this time of crisis.

21:56.176 --> 22:00.847
That's why you're here. He did not give you
license to insinuate yourself into...

22:00.930 --> 22:04.017
Wait, wait, wait.
Put your back down, Lynne.

22:05.477 --> 22:10.064
I am not here to trespass on your territory.
I am here to help.

22:10.148 --> 22:15.236
That's why I'm coming to you first
before I go directly to David.

22:15.320 --> 22:18.406
Mrs Palmer, that sounds like a threat to me.

22:19.741 --> 22:23.453
Unless David's speech is pitch-perfect,
which it is not,

22:23.536 --> 22:27.123
Wieland's allegations might
bring down this presidency.

22:27.207 --> 22:29.542
I don't need you to tell me
how important this is.

22:29.626 --> 22:32.796
Then you owe it to David
to look at my revisions.

22:54.692 --> 22:56.778
Give me your hand.

23:00.407 --> 23:02.492
Come on.

23:17.048 --> 23:19.217
We got a survivor here.

23:21.010 --> 23:24.389
This doesn't look like search and rescue.

23:26.933 --> 23:30.228
- Who are they? Are they coming for you?
- I don't know!

23:35.358 --> 23:37.777
Don't even think about it! Keep going!

23:39.446 --> 23:41.948
Go, go!

23:58.381 --> 24:00.967
Keep going! Keep going!

24:02.719 --> 24:04.804
Take cover in the creek bed.

24:10.268 --> 24:15.023
There's too many of them for me to handle.
I need your help. Give me your hands.

24:15.607 --> 24:18.860
I need you to run recon for me
and handle the ammunition.

24:18.943 --> 24:22.280
You screw with me now, and we both die.
Do you understand?

24:22.363 --> 24:26.076
Jack, we need to get to higher ground
so I can spot for you.

24:26.159 --> 24:28.703
Take the ammunition. Go. Go!

25:07.867 --> 25:11.996
Would you like some water, Kate?
Maybe some tea?

25:18.211 --> 25:21.589
- How do you know my name?
- I know more than that.

25:21.673 --> 25:24.801
I know you are 29 years old, unmarried.

25:24.884 --> 25:28.346
I know you have an economics degree
from Stanford.

25:33.435 --> 25:35.520
Who are you?

25:41.234 --> 25:43.737
My name is Syed Ali.

25:46.865 --> 25:49.617
You know who I am?

25:50.702 --> 25:53.371
I've heard your name mentioned.

25:55.540 --> 25:58.960
What else have you heard about me?

25:59.043 --> 26:01.171
Nothing.

26:05.008 --> 26:09.053
Kate, what have you found
in your father's files?

26:11.556 --> 26:16.019
You were looking in places you do not
belong. You must have seen some things.

26:17.520 --> 26:19.856
I don't know what you're talking about.

26:22.317 --> 26:24.402
Really?

26:29.699 --> 26:32.535
Let go of me! Let go of me!

26:33.870 --> 26:38.750
I told you, I don't know what you are
talking about. You got the wrong guy.

26:38.833 --> 26:42.670
Paul? Oh, my God. What are you doing?

26:42.754 --> 26:47.258
He tells us your father works for the CIA.
This is not new information.

26:47.342 --> 26:49.636
Tell us what you saw and who you told.

26:49.719 --> 26:53.681
We didn't tell anyone
because we didn't see anything!

26:53.765 --> 26:57.102
He's telling you the truth!
Please don't do this!

26:57.185 --> 27:00.772
Listen to me. Nothing can get
in the way of this sacred day.

27:00.855 --> 27:05.193
- Tell us what you saw and who you told.
- We didn't see anything, I swear!

27:05.276 --> 27:08.822
- The files deleted themselves...
- Don't lie to me, Kate!

27:08.905 --> 27:10.865
- I'm not lying!
- She's not lying!

27:10.949 --> 27:14.119
They were self-deleting files!
We don't know anything!

27:14.202 --> 27:17.038
- What are you...
- No! Stop it!

27:17.122 --> 27:20.417
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

27:50.155 --> 27:52.031
Jack, I can spot you from here.

27:59.914 --> 28:01.541
I'm set. Where are they?

28:01.624 --> 28:05.044
11 o'clock, 90 metres, moving left.

28:14.804 --> 28:16.890
- I'm out!
- Last pack, Jack.

28:21.811 --> 28:25.148
- Where are they?
- Ten o'clock, within 50 metres.

28:37.702 --> 28:40.205
That's it!

28:43.333 --> 28:46.795
- Where are they now?
- Ten o'clock, two o'clock, higher ground.

28:57.472 --> 29:00.975
It's a CTU chopper!
They're gonna make a sweep! Stay down!

29:14.989 --> 29:17.283
Stay down!

29:34.717 --> 29:38.930
Drop it, Jack. I said drop it!

29:42.809 --> 29:46.980
I don't wanna shoot you just yet,
but I will if I have to!

29:50.900 --> 29:53.486
Drop the gun! Drop it! It's over!

29:54.779 --> 29:58.616
Stand down! Stand down or he's dead!

30:01.077 --> 30:05.749
Stand down! She's the only one
who can get us to the bomb!

30:08.501 --> 30:11.129
I wanna talk to the president!

30:13.673 --> 30:15.842
Now!

30:28.521 --> 30:30.774
Megan.

30:39.783 --> 30:40.992
Megan!

30:42.494 --> 30:43.828
- Come here.
- Kim!

30:43.912 --> 30:45.747
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

30:48.041 --> 30:49.876
- I'm scared.
- I know.

30:49.959 --> 30:52.712
- It's scary, but you're doing so good.
- Let's go.

30:52.796 --> 30:54.839
Wait. Where are you taking her?

30:54.923 --> 30:57.133
Do you know where you're going, baby?

30:58.927 --> 31:02.013
Aunt Emily. She's my mom's sister.

31:05.141 --> 31:07.727
Do you know where she lives?

31:08.895 --> 31:12.857
- Santa Barbara.
- Santa Barbara?

31:14.818 --> 31:17.404
Santa Barbara. That's so good.

31:20.949 --> 31:24.953
- Why can't you come with me?
- Oh...

31:25.036 --> 31:28.373
Oh, I will soon, OK?

31:29.207 --> 31:32.001
- I don't wanna go.
- I know.

31:35.422 --> 31:39.426
OK, let's go. Your aunt's waiting.

31:39.509 --> 31:43.680
Go on, OK? You can go now.

31:44.973 --> 31:47.517
Go on. Go on. Don't cry.

31:47.600 --> 31:51.646
No, no, shh. I'm gonna see you soon, OK?

31:59.487 --> 32:04.576
Santa Barbara, that's like, what,
50 miles outside of LA?

32:04.659 --> 32:07.787
- It's more like a hundred.
- Oh, God.

32:07.871 --> 32:10.915
She's gonna be OK.

32:36.733 --> 32:39.235
- Mr Mason, Tony.
- Yeah.

32:44.365 --> 32:48.995
Jack's alive. Seven hostiles were killed,
but there's a complication.

32:49.079 --> 32:51.706
- What?
- Nina Myers took Jack hostage.

32:51.790 --> 32:55.376
She's demanding to speak to the president.

32:55.460 --> 32:59.422
Have Richards and Maccabee
take him to Bob Warner's office.

33:03.343 --> 33:06.471
- Let me talk to her.
- She'll be here when you get back.

33:06.554 --> 33:11.935
We were supposed to get married in an hour.
Just let me explain everything to her.

33:14.562 --> 33:17.565
You have one minute.
Watch him. I'm gonna make a call.

33:17.649 --> 33:21.152
- What did they do to you?
- They just asked me questions.

33:21.236 --> 33:23.863
- Everything's fine.
- Are you sure?

33:23.947 --> 33:28.535
Larry is on his way with a criminal lawyer.
He's one of the top guys in the city.

33:28.618 --> 33:32.831
I'm not gonna need a lawyer.
But your father might.

33:32.914 --> 33:35.250
I don't understand.

33:37.168 --> 33:39.796
Reza, what's going on?

33:42.632 --> 33:45.427
It's your father, Marie.

33:45.510 --> 33:49.055
They think that he might have
something to do with Syed Ali.

33:51.182 --> 33:53.560
My father?

33:54.477 --> 33:58.690
- Yeah, he tried to use me.
- Used you how?

33:58.773 --> 34:03.903
To do business with Ali, who they
say is part of this terrorist group.

34:03.987 --> 34:07.449
- My father? Part of a terrorist group?
- They have proof.

34:07.532 --> 34:12.536
They have this transaction
that's connecting one of us to Ali.

34:13.580 --> 34:15.873
And I know I didn't write it.

34:18.168 --> 34:22.088
I'm sorry to put you in
this impossible situation.

34:28.803 --> 34:34.100
I love you, and I wanna be with you.

34:34.184 --> 34:38.438
But right now, something really bad
might happen if I don't help them.

34:39.522 --> 34:43.860
After everything he's done for you,
to turn on my father...

34:43.943 --> 34:47.112
He turned on me. He turned on us.

34:48.572 --> 34:51.117
What else was I supposed to do?

34:52.744 --> 34:54.329
Marie...

35:00.210 --> 35:02.796
- Come on, let's go.
- Marie.

35:20.438 --> 35:23.191
We have a secured line ready.

35:23.274 --> 35:25.402
That's Nina Myers.

35:26.945 --> 35:29.406
Mike, you should talk to her first.

35:29.489 --> 35:33.993
I don't want to give her access to me
until she gives us something in return.

35:38.456 --> 35:44.629
Miss Myers... this is Mike Novick.
I'm the president's Chief of Staff.

35:44.712 --> 35:49.134
- I asked to speak with the president.
- He's not available.

35:49.217 --> 35:52.011
Do you wanna stop this nuclear bomb or not?

35:52.095 --> 35:55.974
- Of course we do.
- Then put the president on.

35:56.057 --> 35:59.018
I'm authorised to negotiate on his behalf.

36:00.812 --> 36:03.940
What I want is nonnegotiable.

36:04.899 --> 36:07.360
What do you want?

36:07.444 --> 36:11.781
I'll tell you where the bomb is
in exchange for immunity.

36:13.366 --> 36:16.661
The president's already
granted you a total pardon.

36:16.745 --> 36:20.915
Except this is a crime
I haven't committed yet.

36:20.999 --> 36:23.626
What crime?

36:23.710 --> 36:26.087
The murder of Jack Bauer.

36:31.926 --> 36:35.221
Add that to my pardon,
and I'll tell you where the bomb is.

36:36.222 --> 36:37.891
And if we don't comply?

36:39.100 --> 36:41.186
We don't have a choice.

36:41.269 --> 36:44.898
- Is that you, Mr Bauer?
- Yes.

36:44.981 --> 36:49.861
Please tell the president that he has
no other choice but to accept her deal.

36:55.283 --> 36:58.161
- Is CTU on a secured line?
- Yes. This is George Mason.

36:58.244 --> 37:03.416
We're on a designated channel.
Except Michelle Dessler and Tony Almeida.

37:04.959 --> 37:07.587
Do you have alternatives
to what she's asking?

37:07.670 --> 37:10.173
Any weaknesses that we can exploit?

37:11.800 --> 37:15.345
None. She's a survivor, sir.
She knows Bauer.

37:15.428 --> 37:21.017
She knows if she doesn't kill him now,
he'll hunt her down and find her later.

37:24.312 --> 37:30.360
So, in your assessment, Nina Myers
is our best chance to stop this bomb?

37:31.694 --> 37:34.489
Sir, she may be our only chance.

37:55.009 --> 37:59.848
- Ms Myers, this is President Palmer.
- I'm listening.

38:00.723 --> 38:04.269
- Is Jack Bauer there?
- Yes, Mr President. I'm here too.

38:08.690 --> 38:13.695
Ms Myers... if the information you provide

38:13.778 --> 38:18.116
culminates in the successful interception
of the nuclear device,

38:18.199 --> 38:21.453
you will get everything you asked for.

38:26.040 --> 38:29.919
You will be pardoned in advance
for the murder of Jack Bauer.

38:31.838 --> 38:33.798
I can live with that.

38:34.883 --> 38:37.594
Start talking, Nina.

38:39.179 --> 38:42.766
The bomb will be detonated
by a man named Syed Ali.

38:42.849 --> 38:45.518
We know about Ali.
We need to know where he is.

38:45.977 --> 38:49.939
He's at a house in Chatsworth,
on Starling Court.

38:50.023 --> 38:52.442
18 Starling Court.

38:53.735 --> 38:57.030
Contact the local law enforcement
to set up a perimeter.

38:57.113 --> 39:00.241
Coordinate among the relevant agencies.

39:01.326 --> 39:07.040
Ms Myers, you're not to take any action
until we put our hands on this bomb.

39:07.123 --> 39:09.209
Agreed.

39:12.796 --> 39:15.882
- Jack?
- Yes, sir.

39:17.592 --> 39:20.804
Is there anything you want me to do?

39:20.887 --> 39:24.599
Please make sure that
my daughter is safe, sir.

39:27.060 --> 39:30.313
- Tell her that I love her.
- I'll do that.

39:31.356 --> 39:33.900
Thank you, Mr President.

39:37.862 --> 39:41.157
- Jack?
- Mr President...

39:41.241 --> 39:44.577
Please, you don't need to say anything, sir.

39:44.661 --> 39:49.332
There was only one right choice to make,
and you made it.

39:53.628 --> 39:56.005
I'm sorry, Jack.

39:57.340 --> 40:01.219
He's right, Mr President.

40:01.302 --> 40:05.181
It's the only way we're going to
find this nuclear device...

40:06.641 --> 40:08.935
before it's too late.

40:14.107 --> 40:16.192
Sir...

40:22.073 --> 40:24.451
The press corps is waiting.

40:55.064 --> 40:57.776
- You've made some changes.
- Yes, sir.

40:59.486 --> 41:02.697
- It's better.
- Thank you, sir.

41:20.715 --> 41:22.425
For God's sake, stop it!

41:23.134 --> 41:27.097
What do you want?
I don't know what you want!

41:29.474 --> 41:31.267
Yes, you do.

41:32.185 --> 41:36.356
We didn't see anything.
We didn't tell anyone anything!

41:36.439 --> 41:42.153
I swear! I don't know anything!
How can I tell you what I don't know?

41:48.159 --> 41:50.245
I believe you.

42:02.799 --> 42:05.802
If she knew anything,
she would have told us. Kill her.

42:38.501 --> 42:41.713
It won't take them long to find Ali.

42:42.881 --> 42:46.384
This isn't how you thought
it would end, is it, Jack?

42:52.307 --> 42:54.976
This isn't over yet.

42:55.305 --> 43:01.171
