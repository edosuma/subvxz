high-water rescues,

them from their own homes.

29:22.894 --> 29:25.797
{\an3}- Our house just filled
so, so fast.

29:25.864 --> 29:28.099
Once the water entered
the house, it was over.

29:28.166 --> 29:29.501
{\an3}With two kids,
you're thinking...

29:29.567 --> 29:31.402
- Yeah.
- "What are we gonna do?

29:31.469 --> 29:33.037
{\an3}Like, we--we're not gonna have
a way to get the kids out."

29:33.104 --> 29:34.772
{\an1}- No power.
No one could get to us

29:34.839 --> 29:36.374
to help us.
- Before the water could

29:36.441 --> 29:38.943
{\an3}get up over our heads,
we took the kids,

29:39.010 --> 29:41.713
{\an3}got out to the road,
waded through some water.

29:41.779 --> 29:43.414
- With the babies.
- With a baby.

29:43.481 --> 29:44.616
{\an1}- We didn't have a choice
but to wade through it.

29:44.682 --> 29:46.017
- Yeah.
- I mean, if we would've

29:46.084 --> 29:47.485
stayed, I would have
had to swim my kids out,

29:47.552 --> 29:48.786
so it was...
- That would've been

29:48.853 --> 29:50.355
impossible.
- Then or not at all.

29:50.421 --> 29:53.024
- I would really like
to get a lighthouse.

29:53.091 --> 29:55.627
That's what's guiding me home.
- Yeah.

29:55.693 --> 29:56.928
- But at the same time,

29:56.995 --> 29:59.397
{\an1}I want there to be rough waters
around it.

29:59.464 --> 30:01.032
- As a volunteer firefighter,

30:01.099 --> 30:04.936
{\an3}my main job was to wade
through waters that were,

30:05.003 --> 30:07.038
{\an3}you know, chest-deep,
or neck-deep in some cases,

30:07.105 --> 30:10.441
and carrying people
to the rescue boats.

30:10.508 --> 30:11.910
- How tall are you?
- 6'7".

30:11.976 --> 30:15.079
{\an1}- So most people would
be completely underwater.

30:15.146 --> 30:17.081
{\an3}- Absolutely.
It was a nightmare.

30:17.148 --> 30:19.484
- What would you like
to get tattooed today?

30:19.551 --> 30:21.386
{\an3}- My Saint Florian,
who's the patron saint

30:21.452 --> 30:23.821
{\an3}of firefighters.
He's lending his hand

30:23.888 --> 30:26.391
and controlling the elements.
- Right.

30:26.457 --> 30:27.892
- You ready to see
what I created for you?

30:27.959 --> 30:29.827
- I'm ready to see it, Mike.
- Yes.

30:29.894 --> 30:31.596
{\an3}- Wow.

30:31.663 --> 30:32.864
Oh, and the boat...

30:32.931 --> 30:34.566

{\an1}- The lighthouse looks
so good too.

30:36.935 --> 30:38.403

of the park for sure.

30:40.038 --> 30:42.006

30:47.779 --> 30:50.715
{\an3}and then it actually
