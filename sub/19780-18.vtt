Come here, buddy.

00:31.918 --> 00:34.328
Come on.

01:22.782 --> 01:25.816
I've always secretly
wanted a shotgun wedding.

01:26.182 --> 01:27.239
What?

01:27.264 --> 01:28.930
Yeah, St. Catherine's tradition.

01:30.569 --> 01:31.581
Okay, all right.

01:31.606 --> 01:33.584
Well, let's, uh, let's talk honeymoon.

01:33.616 --> 01:34.893
We're headed to the Millbrook Inn.

01:34.918 --> 01:35.808
I thought this was our honeymoon.

01:35.833 --> 01:37.685
No, baby, this is our wedding night.

01:37.742 --> 01:38.875
Oh.

01:38.900 --> 01:41.852
This is just the... just the beginning.

01:41.877 --> 01:44.892
So what about Paris?

01:44.917 --> 01:46.107
Too cold.

01:46.132 --> 01:47.564
I want the beach.

01:47.589 --> 01:48.889
Mm.

01:48.914 --> 01:51.347
And you know I've always
wanted to go to Bali.

01:51.372 --> 01:53.939
- Yeah? Bali, Indonesia, huh?
- Mm-hmm.

01:53.993 --> 01:56.827
Hey, buddy, what do you think
about a 23-hour plane ride, huh?

01:56.861 --> 01:59.411
No?

02:00.299 --> 02:02.999
Okay, we'll just dose him
with Gravol and scotch.

02:04.215 --> 02:05.949
Bali it is.

02:09.806 --> 02:12.597
- Hello?
- Charlie. Alex.

02:12.622 --> 02:13.807
Guys, I didn't wanna have to do this,

02:13.832 --> 02:14.972
but we're kind of out of options.

02:14.997 --> 02:16.628
Hey, I want all those extra
beds lining the hallway

02:16.653 --> 02:17.870
for the overflow patients.

02:17.895 --> 02:19.042
Did you hear about the pile-up?

02:19.067 --> 02:20.697
No. Do you need us to come back in?

02:20.722 --> 02:22.930
No, that's not why I'm calling.
There's another problem.

02:22.955 --> 02:23.884
City's in gridlock.

02:23.908 --> 02:25.789
Almost every ambulance is
tied up on the highway.

02:25.830 --> 02:28.314
Rosa, can you go to the
lab and get all the O-neg

02:28.339 --> 02:30.359
and plasma that they have? Thank you.

02:30.384 --> 02:32.194
Listen, dispatch called.

02:32.219 --> 02:33.952
Passenger van lost
control and overturned.

02:33.977 --> 02:35.674
They want us to send someone to buy time

02:35.699 --> 02:37.658
until an ambulance frees up.

02:38.357 --> 02:40.483
The accident is on your way up north.

02:40.508 --> 02:42.663
Guys, listen.

02:42.688 --> 02:44.320
The van is full of kids.

02:44.345 --> 02:46.625
Oh. We have to.

02:46.650 --> 02:49.151
- Text us the address.
- Okay. Thank you.

02:49.176 --> 02:53.340
Oh. And hey, love birds, I heard
the news. Congratulations.

02:54.224 --> 02:56.491

02:56.516 --> 02:58.429
I'm stuck!

03:00.486 --> 03:03.052
I'm stuck! Hello?

03:03.077 --> 03:04.893
I'm in here!

03:04.918 --> 03:07.704
Hang tough. Right back.

03:07.729 --> 03:09.304
Mm-hmm.

03:10.786 --> 03:12.578
Help!

03:16.293 --> 03:18.617
Somebody, please help!

03:18.642 --> 03:20.909
Hey. You okay?

03:21.992 --> 03:24.526
I'm stuck.

03:24.551 --> 03:25.487
Can you help him?

03:25.512 --> 03:27.546
Yeah, just, uh, keep
talking to me, all right?

03:27.571 --> 03:29.394
- Okay.
- What are your names?

03:29.419 --> 03:33.362
Joseph Woods and that's Mr. Hines. Ryan.

03:33.387 --> 03:35.026
Hey, where ya... where
ya comin' from, Joe?

03:35.794 --> 03:39.948
Sudbury. We're supposed to be
singing at this charity thing.

03:39.973 --> 03:41.549
Joe?

03:41.675 --> 03:43.075
Oh, my God.

03:43.100 --> 03:46.477
Okay, honey, Mommy's gonna step
out just for a second, okay?

03:46.800 --> 03:47.966
Okay.

03:50.016 --> 03:51.862
Hey.

03:51.887 --> 03:53.276
Hey.

03:53.840 --> 03:56.847
My name is Alex. I'm a doctor.
I'm gonna try to help you, okay?

03:56.872 --> 03:58.205
Do you mind if I have a look?

03:58.230 --> 04:00.253
Okay.

04:00.278 --> 04:02.089
All right, I'm gonna
need to stabilize this

04:02.114 --> 04:04.018
and I have to put pressure on it.
Are you ready?

04:04.043 --> 04:05.425
- Mm-hmm.
- Here we go.

04:05.450 --> 04:07.034
- Aah!
- I know.

04:07.059 --> 04:09.081
Come on.

04:09.247 --> 04:12.003
All right.

04:12.028 --> 04:13.424
It's not his fault.

04:13.449 --> 04:14.808
Okay.

04:14.833 --> 04:17.997
All right, Ryan, head over
to the other shoulder.

04:18.022 --> 04:20.175
♪ Knees and toes, knees and toes ♪

04:20.200 --> 04:23.764
There's another doctor there.
Her name's Alex. Go to her.

04:24.538 --> 04:28.010
Okay, Joe. Coming in.

04:29.715 --> 04:31.573
Ah!

04:31.598 --> 04:34.331
Uh, can I get a little
help over here, please?

04:34.356 --> 04:35.818
Okay, I need you to take your hands

04:35.843 --> 04:38.487
and put some pressure down.
Keep it firm.

04:43.080 --> 04:45.612
Excuse me, sir. Can you hear me?

04:56.155 --> 04:58.040
- Hey, Joe. Look at me.
- Uh...

04:58.065 --> 04:59.587
Look at me, Joe.

04:59.612 --> 05:01.728
Okay, I'm an orthopedic surgeon.

05:01.753 --> 05:04.138
Okay, I can fix that. Piece of cake.

05:04.163 --> 05:06.223
Right now, we just need
to get you out of here.

05:06.251 --> 05:08.267
Stay with me, okay?

05:10.334 --> 05:12.667
Charlie! You need to get out!

05:12.692 --> 05:14.212
Three!

05:14.237 --> 05:16.358
Ow. Aah!

05:18.751 --> 05:20.550
Charlie!

05:20.575 --> 05:24.116
Get out of the van! Now! Come on!

05:24.615 --> 05:27.290
Come on.

05:30.831 --> 05:32.226
Compound fracture in his right tibia,

05:32.251 --> 05:34.095
but his vitals are stable.

05:36.673 --> 05:38.423
Okay, just lean in right here.

05:38.448 --> 05:40.090
Yeah, right here.

05:42.868 --> 05:45.111
Here we go. Help is on its way.

05:45.135 --> 05:46.524
Help is here.

05:46.550 --> 05:48.650
You'll be all right. You'll be okay.

05:48.675 --> 05:51.689
Charlie.

05:58.581 --> 05:59.887
Oh.

06:01.929 --> 06:03.251
Hey, buddy.

06:03.276 --> 06:05.329
We're gonna go now, all right?

06:05.354 --> 06:07.829
Next stop, Bali.

06:07.854 --> 06:09.285
Mmm.

06:09.310 --> 06:11.087
Paradise...

06:11.364 --> 06:13.456
here we come.

06:18.849 --> 06:20.173

06:31.548 --> 06:33.481
He's waking up.

06:36.886 --> 06:38.853
Hey, buddy.

06:38.878 --> 06:40.190
How you doin'?

06:40.215 --> 06:41.853
Is it over?

06:42.617 --> 06:44.148
Did he get my liver?

06:44.173 --> 06:45.697
No.

06:45.817 --> 06:48.117
We, uh, we had to stop the surgery.

06:48.244 --> 06:50.250
You had an allergic
reaction to the anesthesia.

06:50.275 --> 06:53.080
Oh, oh, easy, Jackson. You're okay.

06:53.276 --> 06:54.970
What about Randy?

06:54.995 --> 06:57.704
Sorry, Dr. Bishop,

06:57.729 --> 06:59.259
But I'm under orders to clear the OR

06:59.284 --> 07:00.454
and get you down to Emerg.

07:00.479 --> 07:02.713
They're slammed.

07:03.102 --> 07:05.923
Hey, it's not over for Randy yet.

07:05.948 --> 07:07.970
We both know that's not true.

07:09.148 --> 07:10.972
Okay, everybody, listen up.

07:10.997 --> 07:13.149
If you are here with your loved
ones and you are not injured,

07:13.174 --> 07:15.126
I need you to go back out
into the waiting room.

07:15.151 --> 07:17.118
That goes for anybody
non-emerge as well.

07:17.143 --> 07:18.133
We need space to work.

07:18.158 --> 07:19.744
We will come to you when we are ready.

07:19.768 --> 07:22.995
Dr. Kinney, fire kid
from the van accident.

07:23.020 --> 07:23.908
On it.

07:23.933 --> 07:27.406
Abdominal lacerations. I
think they run pretty deep.

07:27.776 --> 07:30.159
Please, let us stay together.

07:30.184 --> 07:31.704
Yeah. It's gonna be okay.

07:31.729 --> 07:33.996
Dr. Scott, get this girl up to the OR.

07:36.500 --> 07:38.166
Billy.

07:38.191 --> 07:39.993
Go on.

07:40.018 --> 07:43.454
Lopez, she's yours. Move!

07:51.090 --> 07:54.658
Hey, you know those doctors
from the accident?

07:54.683 --> 07:56.509
Well, they're like a
couple of superheroes.

07:56.534 --> 07:58.352
- You know?
- Okay, just, uh, just breathe deeply.

08:00.846 --> 08:02.986
Okay, someone get me Dawn Bell.

08:03.011 --> 08:05.269
No offense, but you guys don't
look like your typical choir.

08:05.294 --> 08:06.415
Oh, we're not.

08:06.440 --> 08:10.392
These kids, it's either
show tunes or juvie.

08:12.035 --> 08:14.134
Crap.

08:14.159 --> 08:15.634
Hey, get these kids out
of here right now.

08:15.659 --> 08:18.368
I need that defib!

08:18.393 --> 08:21.335
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

08:22.551 --> 08:24.140
What's the charge?

08:24.165 --> 08:25.384
300.

08:25.409 --> 08:28.134
Like a little allergic
reaction's gonna keep me away.

08:28.423 --> 08:30.800
I missed you. Clear!

08:31.948 --> 08:34.347
Got more incoming!

08:34.629 --> 08:36.962
Come on! Let's go, people!

08:36.988 --> 08:38.851
Excuse me, guys. Can
we get through here?

08:38.876 --> 08:41.438
Thank you. Thank you.

08:41.688 --> 08:43.134
She's unresponsive and tachycardic.

08:43.159 --> 08:45.267
- So what have we got?
- She's unresponsive and tachycardic.

08:45.292 --> 08:46.945
Alex!

08:47.785 --> 08:49.556
We need a large bore I.V. with ringers!

08:49.581 --> 08:51.680
And more hands out here!
All hands, right now!

08:51.705 --> 08:53.017
I'm right here, Dana. I can help.

08:53.042 --> 08:55.035
Hey, go! Let's move!
Where are the others?

08:55.060 --> 08:56.893
They're right behind us. Any minute.

08:56.918 --> 08:59.206
Move. Move!

09:24.824 --> 09:27.359
Keep bagging him.

09:29.706 --> 09:31.672
The second time it happens,

09:31.697 --> 09:34.825
it's even faster than the first.

09:34.971 --> 09:39.287
One moment, everything in your
life is promise and planning.

09:39.932 --> 09:41.725
The next second,

09:41.750 --> 09:44.376
everything is upside down.

09:44.401 --> 09:46.734
Okay, let's get him up to Imaging.

09:46.759 --> 09:49.881
Life as you knew it ends.

09:49.906 --> 09:53.718
Life to come hangs in the balance.

09:54.129 --> 09:57.241
And there's nothing
left for anyone to do

09:57.266 --> 09:59.030
but hope.

09:59.631 --> 10:02.498
Come on, Alex. Stay with us.
She's gonna need an ultrasound.

10:02.531 --> 10:04.855
Come on, little man. Hang in there.

10:05.373 --> 10:07.419
It's okay, baby. It's all right.

10:07.444 --> 10:08.897
Mommy's here. You're safe.

10:08.922 --> 10:11.820
You're safe, honey.

10:15.101 --> 10:17.154
Charlie.

10:18.664 --> 10:20.044
Charlie, we have to do something.

10:20.069 --> 10:21.683
You have to do something.

10:27.323 --> 10:28.722
Suction, please.

10:28.747 --> 10:30.915
There's too much blood.

10:30.940 --> 10:32.591
Shahir?

10:32.616 --> 10:36.128
His pressure's all over the place.
Hanging more ringers.

10:37.706 --> 10:39.724
Oh, Charlie.

10:39.749 --> 10:42.264
Where is Dr. Sekara?
I need an assistant.

10:42.289 --> 10:43.951
- I'm here.
- Okay, we have multiple bleeds.

10:43.976 --> 10:45.421
Heavy impact on the left occipital lobe.

10:45.446 --> 10:46.460
Push more Manitol.

10:46.485 --> 10:49.149
We need more Manitol and 4 units of FFP.

10:49.174 --> 10:51.219
Dr. Sekara, I need you in here

10:51.244 --> 10:53.319
packing these bleeders right now.

10:53.344 --> 10:54.576
The word "hope"

10:54.601 --> 10:56.000
first appeared in the English language

10:56.025 --> 10:57.514
about 1,000 years ago.

10:57.539 --> 10:58.912
Gel foam.

10:58.937 --> 11:01.886
Originally meant to
describe a combination

11:01.911 --> 11:04.873
of desire and confidence.

11:05.226 --> 11:10.037
The problem for doctors is
that what we desire... life...

11:10.485 --> 11:13.420
well, that's something we're
not all that confident about.

11:16.560 --> 11:19.038
- He's braddy!
- He's braddy.

11:19.646 --> 11:22.475
So in the end, what are
we confident about?

11:22.500 --> 11:23.859
We're losing him.

11:23.884 --> 11:27.812
Well, that would be death.

11:38.881 --> 11:41.471
Oh! There you are.

11:41.496 --> 11:42.989
Dana?

11:43.014 --> 11:45.397
You're back. Sweetheart, she's back.

11:45.999 --> 11:47.632
My baby?

11:47.657 --> 11:49.366
Fine.

11:49.391 --> 11:53.030
You've been in an accident, but
you and the baby are fine.

11:54.169 --> 11:58.104
What about Charlie? Or Luke?

11:58.294 --> 12:00.512
They're being looked after.

12:01.392 --> 12:03.683
What happened to them?

12:04.836 --> 12:07.561
Charlie suffered a skull fracture.

12:07.586 --> 12:09.952
Shahir is with him in the OR.

12:13.968 --> 12:15.166
Luke?

12:16.811 --> 12:19.512
He's in the OR with Dr. Bishop.

12:19.537 --> 12:23.301
Oh. Okay. Okay.

12:23.326 --> 12:24.525
Alex, what are you doing?

12:24.550 --> 12:25.975
I-I need to be with them.

12:26.000 --> 12:27.801
No, Alex. This is not a good idea.

12:27.826 --> 12:30.059
You need to stay monitored.
I am not staying here

12:30.084 --> 12:32.571
while my husband and son are in surgery.

12:32.596 --> 12:34.256
- Alex...
- No, please.

12:34.281 --> 12:36.084
Please, please, don't make me stay here

12:36.109 --> 12:38.043
- and do nothing.
- No.

12:38.124 --> 12:40.190
Dawn, please.

12:42.298 --> 12:44.931
At least let Dana give you a ride.

12:44.956 --> 12:47.992
Every time I pack off these bleeders...
They just keep coming.

12:48.017 --> 12:50.061
His brain is swelling.

12:50.086 --> 12:52.448
I don't think I can do this.

12:52.473 --> 12:54.190
Don't you give up.

12:54.215 --> 12:55.881
Hey.

12:56.015 --> 12:58.082
Don't give up.

12:59.021 --> 13:01.685
I don't die.

13:01.710 --> 13:04.951
Okay? And I won't die.

13:04.989 --> 13:08.955
So you just keep bringing
me back like you always do.

13:08.980 --> 13:10.957
One more time.

13:16.570 --> 13:18.576
Bishop?

13:18.602 --> 13:20.139
Alex, what are you doing here?

13:20.164 --> 13:21.459
Okay, what's going on? How is he?

13:21.484 --> 13:22.077
Dana...

13:22.102 --> 13:24.052
You try keeping a mother
away from her sick child.

13:24.077 --> 13:25.569
How is he?

13:25.594 --> 13:27.102
His CT shows a tear to his spleen

13:27.127 --> 13:29.108
as well as some damage
to his left kidney.

13:29.133 --> 13:30.498
We'll know more once we get in there.

13:30.523 --> 13:31.928
- Okay.
- Hey.

13:31.953 --> 13:34.748
Hey, back off, okay? I-I
need to go in there.

13:34.773 --> 13:36.678
I-I can't let a woman who just survived

13:36.703 --> 13:39.471
a major traumatic incident
pick up a scalpel and operate.

13:39.496 --> 13:41.629
Sweetheart, he's right.

13:41.654 --> 13:43.020
Thank you.

13:43.045 --> 13:44.911
If it were Molly on that table,

13:44.936 --> 13:47.358
would you let that stop you?

13:49.330 --> 13:51.857
Scrub up. We both will.

13:51.882 --> 13:53.170
I'm gonna be her proxy.

13:53.195 --> 13:55.916
But, Alex, you're gonna stay
out of the sterile field,

13:55.941 --> 13:58.295
and more importantly,
stay off our backs.

13:58.320 --> 13:59.568
Fine.

13:59.653 --> 14:01.584
You know this is crazy, right?

14:01.609 --> 14:05.221
Welcome back to Hope Zion.

14:11.117 --> 14:12.417
How are they?

14:12.442 --> 14:16.064
I just came from Alex's room.
She woke up.

14:16.089 --> 14:17.569
Oh, that's amazing.

14:17.594 --> 14:19.403
What about Charlie and Luke?

14:19.428 --> 14:21.491
They're both still in surgery.

14:23.405 --> 14:26.173
What's this?

14:26.198 --> 14:28.271
It's the van driver's test results.

14:28.296 --> 14:32.098
Significant S.T. elevation,
poor ventricular function.

14:32.123 --> 14:34.202
EKG is all over the map.

14:34.235 --> 14:36.209
His heart attacked
caused the first crash.

14:36.234 --> 14:37.779
It's amazing that he even made it here.

14:37.804 --> 14:40.357
He's 38 years old. What would
cause heart problems like this?

14:40.382 --> 14:43.069
Idiopathic, so it could be anything.

14:43.094 --> 14:44.561
Birth defect.

14:44.586 --> 14:45.749
Drugs?

14:45.774 --> 14:47.851
I don't want to assume anything,

14:47.876 --> 14:49.809
but with a patient this young,

14:49.834 --> 14:51.350
it's something you have to consider.

14:51.375 --> 14:53.639
If he didn't roll that van,
none of this would've happened.

14:53.664 --> 14:56.146
Let's just... focus on the job.

14:56.171 --> 14:58.004
We'll let the police
figure out what happened.

14:59.654 --> 15:02.264
Zone 3, alarm nursing station.

15:02.289 --> 15:04.556
Zone 3, alarm nursing station.

15:04.581 --> 15:06.214
Katrina, the driver of the crash...

15:06.239 --> 15:07.405
where are his personal effects?

15:07.430 --> 15:09.062
Basement lock-up. Why?

15:09.087 --> 15:10.243
Thank you.

15:10.456 --> 15:13.491
How's the renal artery coming, Dr.
Bishop?

15:13.516 --> 15:15.950
You should be finishing
the anastomosis by now.

15:15.975 --> 15:17.959
Almost there, Alex.

15:17.984 --> 15:20.467
Careful with the sutures. Make
sure you get enough bites.

15:20.492 --> 15:22.600
Alex... please.

15:22.625 --> 15:24.325
Sorry, Bishop.

15:26.695 --> 15:28.511
Okay, snip.

15:31.368 --> 15:33.734
Graft is in place.

15:37.514 --> 15:40.038
Removing the clamp.

15:53.982 --> 15:55.755
Ah!

15:55.780 --> 15:57.225
We have full perfusion.

15:57.250 --> 15:58.416
Thank God.

15:58.441 --> 16:00.693
That's my guy.

16:00.718 --> 16:03.483
- You good to close, Dr. Bishop?
- Yes. Yeah.

16:05.698 --> 16:07.631
He's gonna be okay.

16:07.909 --> 16:10.920
Alex?

16:13.953 --> 16:16.486
Alex, we need to talk. It's Charlie.

16:27.662 --> 16:29.556
You said anything could
cause his arrhythmia.

16:29.581 --> 16:30.936
What about this?

16:30.961 --> 16:32.744
I found it in his stuff.

16:32.792 --> 16:34.325
What the hell are you doing

16:34.350 --> 16:37.186
going through a patient's
pockets without his consent...

16:37.211 --> 16:38.506
Screw his consent.

16:38.531 --> 16:40.772
when you have an ER full of
people who need your attention?

16:40.797 --> 16:43.420
How can you not be furious about this?

16:47.314 --> 16:49.247
I get it.

16:49.272 --> 16:51.069
You're looking for somebody to blame.

16:51.094 --> 16:53.010
These aren't just any patients, okay?

16:53.035 --> 16:54.764
It's Charlie and Alex and the kids.

16:54.789 --> 16:56.452
He did this to all of them.

16:56.477 --> 16:59.352
Job first. Emotions later.

16:59.878 --> 17:01.277
Right.

17:01.556 --> 17:03.923
Zone 3, alarm nursing station.

17:11.685 --> 17:14.367
You said you managed to
control the bleeders.

17:14.392 --> 17:15.920
I did.

17:16.411 --> 17:18.413
That's a good thing.

17:18.830 --> 17:20.827
Why don't you look like
that's a good thing?

17:20.852 --> 17:22.541
Alex...

17:23.627 --> 17:25.763
With diffuse axonal injury...

17:25.789 --> 17:28.657
Then his chances of making a
full recovery are miniscule.

17:28.682 --> 17:30.148
I know what that means.

17:30.173 --> 17:32.540
But that's not the case here, okay?

17:32.565 --> 17:33.866
Charlie has nine lives,

17:33.891 --> 17:36.561
and he will find his way back to us.

17:36.586 --> 17:37.785
Do you understand me?

17:38.099 --> 17:40.037
There are a series of
tests I need to run

17:40.062 --> 17:41.850
to assess Charlie's level
of brain function.

17:41.875 --> 17:43.709
Okay, go ahead.

17:43.734 --> 17:46.827
Okay, maybe you should...

17:49.054 --> 17:51.021
Okay.

17:51.046 --> 17:53.968
Okay, let's start with
the doll's eyes test.

18:15.787 --> 18:17.980
Ah!

18:18.005 --> 18:19.639
You shouldn't put any weight on that.

18:20.266 --> 18:21.880
You've sustained an injury to your knee.

18:21.912 --> 18:24.071
I'm an orthopedic surgeon.

18:24.096 --> 18:26.574
Yeah. So am I.

18:26.599 --> 18:29.319
Oh. I'll use the big words then.

18:29.344 --> 18:30.744
Uh, you have a partial tear

18:30.769 --> 18:32.288
to your posterior cruciate ligament.

18:32.313 --> 18:34.982
- No fracture of the patella?
- No, but I still wanna rule out

18:34.984 --> 18:37.326
any tears to the meniscus
or collateral ligaments.

18:37.351 --> 18:40.757
So this happened on your wedding day?

18:40.782 --> 18:44.374
Oh, downright deadly. Weddings.

18:45.447 --> 18:47.017
Sorry. Excuse my grimness.

18:47.042 --> 18:49.450
It's just, my brother's getting
married in a couple weeks.

18:49.475 --> 18:50.647
I'm the Best Woman.

18:50.672 --> 18:52.382
The speech is literally killing me.

18:52.407 --> 18:54.174
- Well, just speak from the...
- If you say "heart,"

18:54.199 --> 18:55.464
I will break your other leg.

18:56.773 --> 18:59.983
O-okay.

19:00.008 --> 19:02.350
Hey, maybe you can help.

19:02.528 --> 19:04.207
You don't by any chance have a son?

19:04.240 --> 19:06.187
I do, as a matter of fact.

19:06.607 --> 19:08.657
Okay.

19:08.682 --> 19:11.007
What would you say to
him on his wedding day?

19:11.032 --> 19:13.232
I'm... I'm sorry. It's just that my...

19:13.257 --> 19:17.092
I want my brother to get his
quota of fatherly advice,

19:17.222 --> 19:19.702
um, but ours died a long time ago.

19:20.921 --> 19:22.554
Um..

19:22.579 --> 19:25.254
Well, um, my son's only 2,

19:25.279 --> 19:27.646
so my first bit of
advice to him would be,

19:27.671 --> 19:29.504
"Son, you might wanna
wait till you're 3.

19:29.529 --> 19:31.131
"You might be a little bit young." Um...

19:31.881 --> 19:33.866
Okay. And then?

19:33.891 --> 19:35.999
To...

19:36.024 --> 19:38.290
always believe in the possibilities

19:38.314 --> 19:40.581
in her and... and...

19:40.606 --> 19:42.673
everything.

19:42.698 --> 19:44.758
And, uh...

19:46.151 --> 19:48.646
And always remember

19:49.682 --> 19:52.316
that no matter how challenging

19:52.341 --> 19:54.641
the world might seem,

19:54.798 --> 19:57.618
to him and... and this
woman that he loves,

19:57.643 --> 19:59.740
to, uh...

19:59.916 --> 20:04.024
never stop believing that they
can make it a better place.

20:05.354 --> 20:08.488
'Cause they can, you know.

20:08.545 --> 20:10.499
I mean, they can do anything,
they can be anything,

20:10.524 --> 20:13.016
they can save anything if

20:13.041 --> 20:15.829
they just hold on to hope.

20:18.114 --> 20:21.382
Or something along those lines.

20:23.252 --> 20:26.017
- Wow.
- Uh...

20:26.929 --> 20:29.063
Do you mind if I steal
that, like, verbatim?

20:29.088 --> 20:31.001
You can fill your boots
right up to the top.

20:31.026 --> 20:32.344
Okay.

20:32.655 --> 20:35.818
Hey, what is your name? I-I...

20:35.843 --> 20:37.508
I-I don't know you.

20:37.533 --> 20:39.099
Dr. Harris.

20:39.124 --> 20:41.057
But hey, you can call me Charlotte.

20:41.082 --> 20:42.937
I was named after my father.

20:48.212 --> 20:50.458
Cold choleric test.

20:50.483 --> 20:52.460
He said Paris was too cold.

20:52.485 --> 20:53.317
Pardon?

20:53.342 --> 20:55.338
Nothing, it's just our...

20:55.497 --> 20:57.897
our honeymoon. I, uh...

20:57.954 --> 21:00.008
wanted to go to the beach.

21:00.033 --> 21:02.033
Alex, if this is too difficult...

21:02.058 --> 21:03.524
No, I'm fine.

21:04.664 --> 21:09.200
Okay. I'm gonna put cold
water into Charlie's ear.

21:09.358 --> 21:11.825
If his eyes deviate towards the water...

21:11.850 --> 21:13.820
There's still brain function.

21:13.845 --> 21:15.078
Here we go.

21:35.955 --> 21:38.455
Come on, Charlie.

21:38.480 --> 21:40.080
Come on.

21:44.737 --> 21:47.357
His eyes remain fixed.

21:50.059 --> 21:51.595
Try again.

21:51.620 --> 21:52.619
Alex...

21:52.644 --> 21:54.091
He is still in there.

21:54.116 --> 21:56.883
He's gonna come back to
us, so just do it again.

21:58.352 --> 22:00.076
Okay.

22:03.357 --> 22:06.224
Don't be afraid, okay, Charlie?

22:06.703 --> 22:09.904
I'm here. I'm here.

22:15.076 --> 22:18.004
Shahir, his hand. His hand.

22:18.261 --> 22:20.228
Charlie!

22:20.253 --> 22:22.118
Charlie?

22:22.143 --> 22:25.693
Charlie, can you hear me? Charlie!

22:43.970 --> 22:45.611
Lazarus sign.

22:45.636 --> 22:47.370
Spontaneous spinal chord reflexes

22:47.395 --> 22:48.926
can make patients...

22:52.754 --> 22:54.582
Charlie.

23:09.861 --> 23:12.266
Charlotte, stop.

23:13.161 --> 23:14.927
Stop!

23:17.148 --> 23:18.634
Hey, Puke.

23:18.659 --> 23:19.925
Chuck.

23:23.235 --> 23:25.402
What is happening?

23:25.427 --> 23:27.227
You okay?

23:27.347 --> 23:29.659
That's a trick question.

23:31.882 --> 23:34.580
How is she?

23:35.142 --> 23:37.249
It won't be long now.

23:38.587 --> 23:40.878
You should go in there, Luke.

23:43.626 --> 23:45.742
And here I thought she was immortal.

23:45.767 --> 23:48.386
She was a force of nature.

23:54.930 --> 23:56.884
Alex?

24:00.846 --> 24:03.337
Alex?

24:05.524 --> 24:07.117
I'm fine. I'm coming back in.

24:07.142 --> 24:09.291
No, it's not necessary.

24:10.056 --> 24:12.490
What?

24:13.563 --> 24:16.038
He has no active brain function.

24:17.928 --> 24:20.042
Charlie's...

24:22.238 --> 24:24.238
Charlie's brain dead.

24:24.263 --> 24:27.633
No.

24:37.134 --> 24:39.134
Luke is okay.

24:39.733 --> 24:41.866
He's sleeping and he's...

24:41.891 --> 24:43.691
just fine.

24:45.359 --> 24:47.695
And the baby's fine.

24:53.264 --> 24:57.872
I don't get it, you know? I don't.

24:58.913 --> 25:01.750
Why do we have to go
through it all just to...

25:02.397 --> 25:05.754
end up right back here again?

25:12.158 --> 25:14.610
Alex, I saw something.

25:16.804 --> 25:18.771
I don't know if it...

25:18.820 --> 25:20.920
it's what might be

25:20.945 --> 25:23.314
or will be,

25:24.192 --> 25:27.193
but it was amazing.

25:27.266 --> 25:29.568
And it made everything we've
been through worth it

25:29.593 --> 25:31.405
a hundred times over.

25:31.430 --> 25:33.915
I promise you that.

25:48.451 --> 25:49.817
Charlie.

25:49.842 --> 25:51.634
You can see me.

25:54.606 --> 25:56.805
Don't leave me.

25:58.256 --> 26:01.519
I don't know what I'm
gonna do without you.

26:02.553 --> 26:05.354
You know, I saw them.

26:07.508 --> 26:09.697
They were grown.

26:09.722 --> 26:12.154
They were beautiful.

26:13.994 --> 26:16.228
They're everything we hoped they'd be.

26:19.340 --> 26:21.606
Stay.

26:22.396 --> 26:24.363
Baby, I can't.

26:28.020 --> 26:31.289
Everything that's coming

26:31.314 --> 26:34.982
is beautiful and amazing.

26:38.197 --> 26:40.103
Oh.

26:40.128 --> 26:42.564
I'll love you forever.

26:42.952 --> 26:47.566
I love you so much.

26:55.145 --> 26:57.491
Charlie.

26:58.285 --> 26:59.918
Oh, Charlie.

27:59.854 --> 28:01.888
You were in that accident, right?

28:06.351 --> 28:08.646
You okay?

28:08.948 --> 28:10.689
Are you?

28:13.825 --> 28:16.926
No. I'm not.

28:16.951 --> 28:20.419
Why didn't you help her
when we first came in?

28:21.206 --> 28:23.070
I don't know.

28:24.947 --> 28:27.181
I guess I'm going through
a bit of a thing.

28:27.206 --> 28:28.791
Yeah.

28:28.977 --> 28:30.959
I know the feeling.

28:32.020 --> 28:34.665
This whole thing's 'cause of me.

28:35.842 --> 28:38.050
What are you talkin' about?

28:39.750 --> 28:43.472
We pulled over to get gas and, uh...

28:44.321 --> 28:48.143
Mr. Hines and me got in this huge fight.

28:48.436 --> 28:51.604
He was still so mad at me
when we got back on the road

28:51.629 --> 28:53.002
that he...

28:56.577 --> 28:58.343
I gave him a heart attack.

28:58.368 --> 29:00.376
If I hadn't upset him,
all those people...

29:00.401 --> 29:01.933
What was the fight about?

29:02.184 --> 29:06.870
Just trust me, it's all 'cause of me.

29:09.239 --> 29:11.236
So what are you gonna do about it?

29:11.261 --> 29:13.836
Uh....

29:13.885 --> 29:16.505
Probably run away.

29:16.735 --> 29:18.986
Like you are.

29:28.069 --> 29:30.135
You know ever since...

29:30.160 --> 29:33.768
that first accident, you know, the...
the coma, he's...

29:35.492 --> 29:38.292
He was...

29:38.388 --> 29:39.911
straddling two worlds.

29:39.936 --> 29:42.364
He had one foot in death and the...

29:43.192 --> 29:46.095
That's why he was so...

29:47.401 --> 29:49.815
So what?

29:50.953 --> 29:54.334
That's why he was the way he was.

29:54.744 --> 29:57.337
Yeah. Yeah.

29:58.116 --> 30:00.649
And he should've... he should've
died in that first accident,

30:00.674 --> 30:01.494
but somehow...

30:03.944 --> 30:06.275
something brought him back.

30:09.120 --> 30:11.048
That was you.

30:11.073 --> 30:12.690
Sweetheart, it was you.

30:22.098 --> 30:23.580
And we had five years.

30:23.605 --> 30:24.905
Yeah.

30:24.930 --> 30:26.455
And two beautiful children.

30:26.480 --> 30:27.778
Yeah.

30:34.205 --> 30:37.336
It wasn't doomed.

30:37.507 --> 30:39.574
- No.
- It was luck.

30:39.599 --> 30:40.831
Yeah.

30:43.813 --> 30:46.147
We weren't cursed.

30:46.172 --> 30:48.764
We were blessed.

30:53.847 --> 30:56.271
How's the choir leader?

30:56.628 --> 30:59.509
The balloon stent is in,
but it's a stop gap.

30:59.534 --> 31:01.644
If he doesn't get a new
heart in the next 48 hours,

31:01.669 --> 31:03.445
he will die.

31:03.866 --> 31:06.133
You said I was looking
for someone to blame,

31:06.158 --> 31:07.741
and you're right.

31:09.678 --> 31:11.841
But it's not him, Dawn.

31:13.206 --> 31:15.341
I sent them.

31:17.071 --> 31:20.504
They never would've been on
that road if I didn't call.

31:20.572 --> 31:22.840
Zach, that is not true.

31:24.216 --> 31:25.749
That is not true.

31:25.774 --> 31:27.636
Dr. Miller?

31:29.505 --> 31:31.682
Yes?

31:32.014 --> 31:36.365
Uh, Joe here has something
that he needs to tell you.

31:36.617 --> 31:39.573
He knows you found drugs on Mr. Hines.

31:40.842 --> 31:42.943
They were my drugs.

31:42.968 --> 31:44.186
What?

31:44.211 --> 31:45.844
I brought them on the trip.

31:45.869 --> 31:47.615
Mr. Hines found them.

31:48.131 --> 31:50.284
He was just trying to protect me.

31:51.869 --> 31:53.859
It was an accident.

31:55.682 --> 31:58.451
It was just a stupid accident.

32:06.230 --> 32:08.563
We just gotta get through this day.

32:10.301 --> 32:12.127
Yeah.

32:14.991 --> 32:18.526
Wait up. Hey, listen to me.

32:18.551 --> 32:20.647
This isn't your fault.

32:20.750 --> 32:23.317
Okay, this isn't anyone's fault.

32:51.608 --> 32:54.374
Yeah.

32:54.399 --> 32:56.129
Dawn?

32:58.714 --> 33:01.271
Alex, I'm sorry.

33:06.371 --> 33:08.269
Just...

33:08.294 --> 33:10.447
I can't believe that...

33:14.411 --> 33:16.510
Hey, there's no crying in surgery.

33:16.535 --> 33:19.222
Isn't that what you taught me?

33:19.247 --> 33:21.777
I think this is an
exception to that rule.

33:21.802 --> 33:23.769
Yeah.

33:23.794 --> 33:27.130
Well, we'll just, uh,
we'll have a cry later.

33:27.324 --> 33:29.132
Um...

33:29.910 --> 33:33.010
I need you to help me do
something for Charlie.

33:33.035 --> 33:34.308
A request.

33:34.333 --> 33:35.832
Anything.

33:37.255 --> 33:39.595
Charlie's liver, or a
portion of it, will go

33:39.620 --> 33:43.155
to our sclerosing cholangitis
patient Randy Rogen.

33:44.365 --> 33:47.675
Charlie's kidneys... one
will go to Michelle Lamont.

33:47.700 --> 33:49.933
Who has a scholarship coming to her,

33:49.958 --> 33:51.525
music department at U of N.

33:51.550 --> 33:54.366
Dev, I'd like you take the lead on that.
You're ready.

33:54.905 --> 33:58.745
Um, is it okay if I assist on that?

33:59.254 --> 34:01.187
No one I'd rather have in there.

34:01.211 --> 34:03.262
Okay, Sekara and Scott then.

34:03.903 --> 34:07.794
Charlie's other kidney
will go to the General,

34:07.819 --> 34:10.324
to be donated to Dr. Paul Wilder.

34:10.350 --> 34:12.317
Dr. Wilder's dialysis is failing,

34:12.342 --> 34:14.041
so he is too sick to travel.

34:14.161 --> 34:16.583
So Dr. Harris is gonna travel to him.

34:16.608 --> 34:17.396
Yes.

34:17.420 --> 34:20.434
And finally, Charlie's h...

34:20.458 --> 34:22.559
heart.

34:22.583 --> 34:24.551
Sweetheart.

34:24.576 --> 34:25.898
No, I'm fine.

34:25.922 --> 34:27.356
I'm sorry, am I the only one

34:27.380 --> 34:28.871
who sees that we shouldn't
be putting her through this?

34:28.897 --> 34:29.685
You know what?

34:29.710 --> 34:32.210
You're not putting me through
anything here, okay?

34:32.753 --> 34:34.719
This is what Charlie wanted,

34:34.745 --> 34:36.159
and I will do it.

34:37.722 --> 34:40.620
Good. So...

34:43.270 --> 34:45.303
Charlie's heart.

34:45.328 --> 34:47.424
Choir leader.

34:47.706 --> 34:49.940
He seems like the kind
of guy who's worthy.

34:49.965 --> 34:51.260
Good.

34:51.494 --> 34:54.299
We'll start harvesting Charlie's organs.

34:54.324 --> 34:56.324
Transplant will begin immediately.

34:56.902 --> 34:59.784
Now I know you guys have
all worked for 24 hours

34:59.816 --> 35:00.839
and you must be exhausted.

35:00.864 --> 35:03.770
So if you're too tired,
there is no shame in it.

35:06.375 --> 35:08.043
Okay, then.

35:11.372 --> 35:13.417
Thank you.

35:13.844 --> 35:16.114
All of you.

35:17.460 --> 35:19.593
I don't know what I'd
do without you here.

36:42.196 --> 36:44.054
Do you remember that old
show "Just Like Mom,"

36:44.079 --> 36:46.435
where the kids would
take over the kitchen?

36:46.460 --> 36:48.373
Good to see you, too, Dana.

36:48.653 --> 36:50.241
She has to put something in her stomach.

36:50.266 --> 36:52.605
No, I agree, but preferably something

36:52.630 --> 36:54.064
her stomach isn't gonna reject.

36:54.487 --> 36:57.381
And why does your generation
always think a smoothie

36:57.406 --> 36:59.182
is the answer to everything? Hmm?

37:06.658 --> 37:08.767
10 more seconds!

37:14.604 --> 37:16.369
It's me.

37:16.708 --> 37:18.653
Be out in a minute.

37:19.456 --> 37:22.099
Alex, you said that 10 minutes ago.

37:33.562 --> 37:35.327
Can I come in?

37:35.352 --> 37:36.896
You wanna make Luke an orphan?

37:39.824 --> 37:42.026
You've barely eaten in days.

37:46.739 --> 37:48.314
Well, it turns out the shock's moved on

37:48.339 --> 37:50.272
and it's just emptiness all the time.

37:51.965 --> 37:55.166
The souvenir you get from
loving somebody, I guess.

37:55.988 --> 37:57.488
Emptiness?

37:57.513 --> 37:59.221
No.

37:59.316 --> 38:01.112
Grief.

38:02.269 --> 38:04.682
But grief heals with time.

38:14.359 --> 38:16.604
We're all here for you, Alex.

38:16.687 --> 38:19.065
You have our support.

38:51.144 --> 38:53.487
Hey, buddy.

38:56.357 --> 38:58.424
Yeah, sure. Why not? Let's
just jump to the kiss.

38:58.449 --> 39:02.939
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Okay.

39:02.964 --> 39:06.990
Marriage is going to
expand you as individuals,

39:07.015 --> 39:08.610
define you as a couple,

39:08.635 --> 39:11.891
and deepen your love for one another.

39:12.357 --> 39:16.328
You both agreed that to
have a successful marriage,

39:16.353 --> 39:20.673
you'll need strength, courage, patience,

39:20.698 --> 39:23.445
and a really good sense of humor.

39:25.567 --> 39:27.768
This is so strange.

39:27.793 --> 39:30.885
Yeah.

39:37.769 --> 39:39.618
Thank you.

39:39.643 --> 39:40.962
Yeah.

39:41.120 --> 39:43.631
Thank you.

39:43.754 --> 39:47.517
Hey, buddy. Here we go. I got you.

39:47.542 --> 39:49.509
Hey.

39:49.534 --> 39:51.367
Hey, wait.

39:51.392 --> 39:52.923
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

39:52.948 --> 39:54.587
Wait. Okay.

39:54.612 --> 40:00.148
Our love has made me believe, Charlie.

40:01.475 --> 40:04.742
Believe in the possibility of anything.

40:06.771 --> 40:09.339
I promise to be your lover,

40:09.364 --> 40:12.285
companion, and friend,

40:12.310 --> 40:15.622
your partner in parenthood,

40:16.824 --> 40:20.293
your ally in conflict,

40:20.751 --> 40:24.047
your greatest fan

40:24.717 --> 40:27.284
and your toughest adversary.

40:29.809 --> 40:32.758
Your student and teacher.

40:34.096 --> 40:37.477
Your accomplice in mischief.

40:39.314 --> 40:42.870
This is my sacred vow to you.

40:54.410 --> 40:57.745
Luke.

41:15.009 --> 41:16.953
It's okay.

41:20.804 --> 41:23.139
Mommy will play, too. Look it.

41:48.108 --> 41:49.718
Charlie.

41:53.560 --> 41:54.825
Alex.

41:58.712 --> 42:00.680
You're not supposed to be here.

42:00.705 --> 42:02.687
It's okay.

42:02.712 --> 42:05.412
It's too soon. What about the kids?

42:05.437 --> 42:08.067
It's been 50 years.

42:08.092 --> 42:10.570
And the kids are great.

42:11.920 --> 42:14.052
It feels like I just left you.

42:14.077 --> 42:16.409
You were with me every step of the way.

42:16.991 --> 42:19.291
So where do we go now?

42:19.316 --> 42:21.205
I think we're already there.
