WEBVTT

00:04.872 --> 00:07.307
Done cleansing mind and spirit

00:07.508 --> 00:09.977
but the body could use
a little detailing.

00:10.711 --> 00:12.446
MILES:
What attracts you
to a man?

00:12.446 --> 00:13.447
Definitely not this.

00:14.615 --> 00:15.516
Miles, what are you doing?

00:15.516 --> 00:17.017
Pursuing the woman
of my dreams.

00:17.017 --> 00:20.888
Pursuing... stalking...
it's a fine line.

00:21.255 --> 00:23.390
Not you.
Mary Quizzenberry.

00:23.390 --> 00:26.360
She's in my film class
and I love her

00:26.360 --> 00:29.129
and she might love me
if I ever actually
spoke to her.

00:29.129 --> 00:31.265
So I'm making
a documentary
to learn about

00:31.265 --> 00:32.933
what women find
attractive in a man.

00:32.933 --> 00:34.201
Miles, you don't have
to do that.

00:34.201 --> 00:36.036
You know how
to handle yourself
around a woman.

00:36.036 --> 00:37.704
When I tried
to introduce myself

00:37.704 --> 00:38.972
my palms were so sweaty

00:38.972 --> 00:41.875
I inadvertently spilled
Fresca down her sports bra.

00:41.875 --> 00:42.809
Roll camera.

00:44.278 --> 00:46.313
What attracts you
to a man?

00:46.313 --> 00:47.681
First off, good hygiene.

00:47.681 --> 00:50.083
A man's got to know
his way around a Q-Tip.

00:50.083 --> 00:51.818
Cotton swabs, check.
But what else?

00:51.818 --> 00:54.555
He's got to be funny
and nice and smart

00:54.555 --> 00:58.492
and sexy and he's got
to have a killer smile.

00:58.492 --> 01:01.895
Reality check:
that guy does not exist.

01:01.895 --> 01:04.264
Oh, I'm pretty sure
he's out there somewhere.

01:06.433 --> 01:08.402
Good night, Miles.

01:08.402 --> 01:10.137
Good night, Sabrina.

01:12.372 --> 01:13.840
I've already learned one thing.

01:13.840 --> 01:16.176
Chicks dig a guy with a camera.

01:19.813 --> 01:25.919
♪ Life's changing around me,
and I'm gonna make it mine ♪

01:26.420 --> 01:31.992
♪ I'm reaching out
and living by my rules... ♪

01:32.492 --> 01:35.662
♪ Time's moving way too fast ♪

01:35.662 --> 01:39.900
♪ I wanna make it last... ♪

01:41.802 --> 01:45.305
♪ 'Cause I'm out on my own now ♪

01:45.305 --> 01:49.977
♪ And I like the way it feels. ♪

01:59.720 --> 02:00.787
I've scoured
the listings

02:00.787 --> 02:02.356
for every photography-
related job

02:02.356 --> 02:04.791
in a 20-mile radius,
redid Josh's resume

02:04.791 --> 02:06.860
and as a fallback,
got him an interview

02:06.860 --> 02:09.062
with the Sears Family
Photo Department.

02:09.062 --> 02:10.664
Start sewing name tags
in his underwear

02:10.664 --> 02:12.032
and you're officially
his mother.

02:12.032 --> 02:13.634
Roxie, when Josh
didn't go to Prague

02:13.634 --> 02:14.868
and stayed in Boston
for me

02:14.868 --> 02:16.470
it was a supreme
romantic gesture.

02:16.470 --> 02:17.504
You're right.

02:17.504 --> 02:19.706
He could have just
tattooed your name
on his butt.

02:19.706 --> 02:22.242
Yet, his staying
has an enormous backside...

02:22.242 --> 02:23.276
downside.

02:23.276 --> 02:25.078
Eventually, he's
going to realize

02:25.078 --> 02:26.847
that he didn't follow
his dreams

02:26.847 --> 02:28.815
and he's stuck here
in coffee hell.

02:28.815 --> 02:30.250
Tormented and miserable

02:30.250 --> 02:32.319
and resenting
your very existence.

02:32.319 --> 02:33.387
I hadn't gone there yet

02:33.387 --> 02:34.855
but thanks for
the added guilt.

02:34.855 --> 02:36.556
Now I've really got
to make sure

02:36.556 --> 02:38.191
that Josh has
the perfect job.

02:38.191 --> 02:39.493
Josh already has a job.

02:39.493 --> 02:41.528
And I heard that
hell remark, missy.

02:41.528 --> 02:42.529
She's just a little nervous

02:42.529 --> 02:44.097
about having to run the place
without him.

02:44.097 --> 02:45.198
Oh, yeah, petrified.

02:45.198 --> 02:47.100
There are tons of jobs
for photojournalists.

02:47.100 --> 02:50.570
Almost as many as there are
for rock stars and cowboys.

02:50.570 --> 02:54.241
Guess what. I just got
a job as a photojournalist.

02:54.241 --> 02:56.977
Really? I'm ruined!

02:56.977 --> 02:59.646
You are looking at the new
City Desk photographer

02:59.646 --> 03:01.314
for the <i>Boston Citizen.</i> Huh?

03:01.314 --> 03:02.449
Oh, that's fantastic!

03:02.449 --> 03:03.450
That's great news.

03:03.450 --> 03:04.484
For you, too.

03:04.484 --> 03:06.520
I just walked in there
and refused to leave

03:06.520 --> 03:08.355
until somebody looked
at my portfolio.

03:08.355 --> 03:10.490
Mike Shelby said I had
a journalist's instincts

03:10.490 --> 03:11.491
and a great eye...

03:11.491 --> 03:12.492
Mike Shelby?

03:12.492 --> 03:14.361
The two-time Pulitzer Prize-
winning reporter

03:14.361 --> 03:15.762
and editor of the <i>Citizen?</i>

03:15.762 --> 03:16.396
Yeah, he's...

03:16.396 --> 03:17.297
Crusader for the people

03:17.297 --> 03:18.565
who helped clean Boston Harbor.

03:18.565 --> 03:19.533
Yeah, and he's the one who...

03:19.533 --> 03:21.601
Successfully fought
to preserve Indian gaming.

03:21.601 --> 03:24.104
Yes. He's my new boss.

03:24.104 --> 03:25.105
I love him!

03:25.105 --> 03:26.440
Yeah, I got that.

03:26.440 --> 03:27.741
Oh, I'm so proud of you!

03:27.741 --> 03:29.409
Well, I'm going
to take you out

03:29.409 --> 03:31.078
for a big celebration dinner.

03:31.078 --> 03:32.079
Sounds great.

03:32.079 --> 03:33.747
But first we got
to stop by the paper

03:33.747 --> 03:35.215
so I can show you
my new office.

03:35.215 --> 03:36.783
You have your own office?

03:37.350 --> 03:39.920
Actually, it's more
like my own cubby.

03:39.920 --> 03:41.655
This is so cute.

03:41.655 --> 03:44.825
All it needs is
a little personal touch.

03:45.892 --> 03:47.661
Surprise. It was either this

03:47.661 --> 03:50.497
or those little clicky balls
that go back and forth.

03:50.497 --> 03:51.832
Thank you.
This is so...

03:51.832 --> 03:53.366
When did we take this picture?

03:53.366 --> 03:55.936
Oh, I can't believe
you're actually going

03:55.936 --> 03:56.970
to be working here.

03:56.970 --> 03:58.672
I know. And the rest
of the time

03:58.672 --> 04:01.007
I get to be out
in the field
on assignment.

04:01.007 --> 04:02.476
This is so exciting.

04:02.476 --> 04:04.077
Maybe in a few years
we'll be able to work

04:04.077 --> 04:05.412
on the paper together.

04:05.412 --> 04:07.180
You know, me a reporter,
you a...

04:11.718 --> 04:13.186
Josh, these mugs
are magnificent.

04:13.186 --> 04:15.188
I don't know when I've seen
a peck of more perfect pics.

04:15.188 --> 04:17.023
Hey, blondie,
you playing or you talking?

04:17.023 --> 04:18.191
Both. Deal me
in, Blackie.

04:18.191 --> 04:20.360
I got to write
a new lead story
to go with these.

04:20.360 --> 04:21.361
Stop the presses!

04:21.361 --> 04:22.696
God, I love saying that.

04:25.532 --> 04:26.566
Copy!

04:28.235 --> 04:29.803
Breenie, this is brilliant.

04:29.803 --> 04:31.505
Tell me something
I don't know.

04:31.505 --> 04:32.506
Excuse me.

04:32.506 --> 04:33.006
Can't you see we're working here

04:33.006 --> 04:36.276
or don't you recognize
a newsroom when you see one?

04:36.276 --> 04:39.146
Uh, Sabrina,
this is my boss,
Mike Shelby.

04:39.146 --> 04:40.514
Oh, I am so sorry.

04:40.514 --> 04:43.316
I was just having
a newsroom fantasy.

04:43.316 --> 04:45.819
I used to have 'em
all the time.

04:45.819 --> 04:47.487
Except in mine I make
a lot more money

04:47.487 --> 04:48.855
and I look like
Robert Redford.

04:48.855 --> 04:50.757
You know, I've read
everything you've ever written.

04:50.757 --> 04:53.326
So you're the one who's been
going through my trash.

04:53.326 --> 04:54.828
Listen, as long as you're here

04:54.828 --> 04:56.196
would you mind
sticking around?

04:56.196 --> 04:58.398
There's been some activity
on the police scanner.

04:58.398 --> 04:59.399
That'd be incredible.

04:59.399 --> 05:01.735
Oh, you're probably
talking to Josh, huh?

05:01.735 --> 05:03.370
Wow, that would
be fantastic.

05:03.370 --> 05:06.039
Sabrina, I know
we had plans...

05:06.039 --> 05:07.274
To listen
to a police scanner

05:07.274 --> 05:09.109
but you've got one here
so you're all set.

05:09.109 --> 05:10.177
All right,
see you later.

05:10.177 --> 05:11.645
Or you could
stick around here

05:11.645 --> 05:13.480
if you don't mind
listening to sirens

05:13.480 --> 05:15.415
and eating bean burritos
with the boys.

05:15.415 --> 05:18.919
Bring on the beans
and bring on the boys.

05:19.452 --> 05:22.389
( <i>garbled radio transmission)</i>

05:23.557 --> 05:24.991
So, long story short

05:24.991 --> 05:28.161
I find myself sitting
in a foxhole in Kuwait

05:28.161 --> 05:32.265
with Wolf Blitzer,
Morley Safer and Jenny McCarthy.

05:32.265 --> 05:33.366
( <i>both laugh</i> )

05:33.366 --> 05:34.734
I don't know about the troops

05:34.734 --> 05:36.336
but we were
certainly entertained.

05:36.336 --> 05:38.471
Yeah, but nothing tops
the three-legged race

05:38.471 --> 05:40.173
at Camp David
with Henry Kissinger.

05:40.173 --> 05:43.210
Oh, yeah, we beat the pants off
Mandela and Tutu.

05:43.210 --> 05:44.678
Mike, this is amazing.

05:44.678 --> 05:47.414
I could listen to your
stories all night.

05:47.414 --> 05:48.815
Yeah, and I think
we just did.

05:48.815 --> 05:49.816
It's 7:00 A.M.

05:49.816 --> 05:51.218
I got to go to class.

05:51.218 --> 05:53.520
Bye. I got
to go to work.

05:53.820 --> 05:57.958
That was an easy commute.
I love this job.

06:00.393 --> 06:03.864
Hmm, what attracts me to a man?

06:03.997 --> 06:07.200
Well, first and foremost
his intellect.

06:07.200 --> 06:09.603
And barring that, buns of steel.

06:09.736 --> 06:11.438
Let's get back
to intellect.

06:11.438 --> 06:14.241
So far, my knowledge
of advanced astrophysics

06:14.241 --> 06:16.910
has not exactly been
a hit with the ladies.

06:16.910 --> 06:17.577
Really?

06:17.944 --> 06:19.980
Well, it must be
in your presentation.

06:20.413 --> 06:23.116
Miles, women like
a man who is strong

06:23.116 --> 06:25.285
confident and self-assured.

06:25.285 --> 06:27.053
You've got to walk
into a room

06:27.053 --> 06:28.855
take charge and knock them out

06:28.855 --> 06:30.657
with your masculine charisma.

06:30.657 --> 06:33.026
I'm all over it,
chicky baby.

06:33.026 --> 06:34.828
Good luck.

06:34.828 --> 06:37.664
And Miles,
work on the tush.

06:42.802 --> 06:45.538
Sabrina, it's 4:00.

06:45.538 --> 06:47.207
Are you still waiting
for Josh?

06:47.207 --> 06:49.042
Yeah, ever since he took
this new job

06:49.042 --> 06:51.578
he's having trouble
breaking away from the office.

06:51.578 --> 06:52.712
But you know, I'm sure

06:52.712 --> 06:55.282
this picnic lunch will be
perfectly good tomorrow.

06:55.282 --> 06:56.149
As long as Josh doesn't mind

06:56.149 --> 06:59.586
having his salmon salad be
salmonella salad.

07:00.320 --> 07:02.522
I really admire
your positive attitude.

07:02.522 --> 07:04.090
It's tough
on a relationship

07:04.090 --> 07:06.326
when one person has
to work long hours.

07:06.326 --> 07:07.327
Tell me about it.

07:07.327 --> 07:08.995
But this job is perfect
for Josh.

07:08.995 --> 07:10.363
I'm totally happy for him.

07:10.363 --> 07:11.598
I would just be happier

07:11.598 --> 07:13.300
if I occasionally got
to see him.

07:13.300 --> 07:14.267
Oh, you will.

07:14.267 --> 07:16.469
Josh is just paying
his dues.

07:16.469 --> 07:19.072
I remember when I got
my first job

07:19.072 --> 07:21.541
interning for
Leonardo da Vinci.

07:21.541 --> 07:23.777
I was on call
24 hours a day.

07:23.777 --> 07:26.646
And my boyfriend,
a sailor, couldn't stand it

07:26.646 --> 07:28.248
and demanded that I quit.

07:28.248 --> 07:29.449
So did you quit?

07:29.449 --> 07:31.651
Hello? da Vinci?
Mega-genius?

07:31.651 --> 07:33.620
I sent lover boy packing.

07:33.620 --> 07:36.189
Eventually,
he discovered America

07:36.189 --> 07:37.490
so it worked out
for both of us.

07:37.490 --> 07:40.160
So, I just got
to keep being supportive?

07:40.160 --> 07:42.429
And I've just got
to be off.

07:42.429 --> 07:45.265
I know you don't want
any "aunts" spoiling
your picnic. Get it?

07:45.265 --> 07:46.700
Get it?
Got it. Go.

07:46.700 --> 07:47.701
I'm so sorry.

07:47.701 --> 07:48.902
I was almost out the door

07:48.902 --> 07:50.670
when Mike grabbed me
to go to lunch.

07:50.670 --> 07:51.671
Oh, no problem.

07:51.671 --> 07:53.206
Sabrina, Mike's doing
a story on the Mayor

07:53.206 --> 07:54.774
and he wants me to go
over there right now

07:54.774 --> 07:56.376
and shoot the picture.
This is really huge.

07:56.376 --> 07:57.577
Bigger than huge.

07:57.577 --> 07:58.912
I hate to do this
to you again.

07:58.912 --> 08:00.080
Oh, it's okay.

08:00.080 --> 08:02.282
You know we'll be together
tomorrow night at the concert.

08:02.282 --> 08:03.183
Concert?

08:03.183 --> 08:05.385
Remember? Dave Matthews?

08:05.719 --> 08:07.387
Morgan's new boyfriend
got us the tickets?

08:07.387 --> 08:09.122
I don't care
about Dave Matthews.

08:09.122 --> 08:10.490
I'll be there to see you.

08:10.490 --> 08:12.592
Then I better start rehearsing.

08:15.462 --> 08:16.896
Hey, Mike,
I'll see you later.

08:16.896 --> 08:18.965
I'm going to meet Sabrina
for the concert.

08:18.965 --> 08:20.700
At least one of us
will be having a good time.

08:20.700 --> 08:21.501
Something wrong?

08:21.501 --> 08:24.204
I just had a big fight
with my wife.

08:24.204 --> 08:25.138
Oh, I'm sorry.

08:25.138 --> 08:26.873
Oh, don't worry about me.

08:26.873 --> 08:29.109
I'll find a way
to pull it together somehow.

08:29.909 --> 08:32.979
You go. Go, have fun.

08:34.314 --> 08:35.315
No, it's okay.

08:35.315 --> 08:37.984
I totally understand
if you have to work.

08:37.984 --> 08:39.352
Well, that's just it.

08:39.352 --> 08:41.187
When I'm working,
it's great.

08:41.187 --> 08:41.988
Now, I'm just
sitting around

08:41.988 --> 08:43.523
listening to Mike talk.

08:43.523 --> 08:44.758
First it was
about his wife.

08:44.758 --> 08:47.227
Now he's telling
the Jenny McCarthy
in the foxhole story

08:47.227 --> 08:48.495
for the fifth time
this week.

08:48.495 --> 08:49.496
I'm beginning to think

08:49.496 --> 08:51.197
this guy just can't
stand to be alone.

08:51.197 --> 08:52.866
You have to look
at the upside, Josh.

08:52.866 --> 08:55.001
One of the most important
editors in the country

08:55.001 --> 08:56.269
considers you his confidant.

08:56.269 --> 08:58.238
I know. You're right.

08:58.238 --> 09:00.473
Look, I'll get out of here
as quickly as I can.

09:00.473 --> 09:01.441
At the very least
I'll still meet you

09:01.441 --> 09:02.475
at the restaurant
afterwards.

09:02.475 --> 09:03.476
I want to make sure

09:03.476 --> 09:04.978
you remember who
your boyfriend is.

09:04.978 --> 09:06.880
Like I could ever forget that.

09:06.880 --> 09:07.914
( <i>doorbell rings</i> )

09:07.914 --> 09:09.816
See you later.

09:13.386 --> 09:14.387
Harvey?

09:14.387 --> 09:16.523
Sabrina?
What are you
doing here?

09:16.523 --> 09:18.358
I live here.
What are you doing here?

09:18.358 --> 09:19.726
Harvey!

09:19.726 --> 09:21.161
Hey.

09:21.494 --> 09:23.696
Well, that answers
that question.

09:23.696 --> 09:24.697
Morgan, I had no idea

09:24.697 --> 09:26.132
you and Sabrina
were roommates.

09:26.132 --> 09:27.233
Oh, do you two
know each other?

09:27.233 --> 09:28.234
You could say that.

09:28.234 --> 09:31.237
We sort of dated...
a lot.

09:31.237 --> 09:33.173
Oh, <i>that</i> Harvey.

09:33.173 --> 09:37.577
And the evening takes
a disastrous turn.

09:37.577 --> 09:39.512
Don't worry.
Now we're just friends.

09:39.512 --> 09:42.248
I broke up with Sabrina
when I found out she was...

09:42.248 --> 09:44.117
Harvey, what
do you think
you're doing?

09:44.117 --> 09:46.186
I wasn't going to tell her
you're a witch.

09:46.186 --> 09:48.154
I was just going
to say that we broke up

09:48.154 --> 09:50.757
when we found out
we were going to
different schools.

09:50.757 --> 09:51.825
Give me a little credit.

09:51.825 --> 09:52.859
Sorry.

09:52.859 --> 09:54.327
So what's the deal
with you and Morgan?

09:54.327 --> 09:57.263
No deal. Met her
at a fraternity party

09:57.263 --> 09:58.932
we've gone out a couple times

09:58.932 --> 10:01.267
and we will be going
to the Dave Matthews concert

10:01.267 --> 10:03.203
just as soon
as you wiggle your finger.

10:06.206 --> 10:08.274
I broke up with Sabrina
when I found out

10:08.274 --> 10:10.510
she and I were going
to different colleges.

10:10.510 --> 10:11.544
Oh, whew!

10:11.544 --> 10:13.613
I'd hate to think
I picked up something

10:13.613 --> 10:15.615
out of the Spellman reject pile.

10:20.520 --> 10:23.790
I like a guy who's
a little bit dangerous.

10:23.790 --> 10:24.591
Really?

10:24.591 --> 10:26.326
You know, I've never
told this to anyone

10:26.326 --> 10:27.827
but sometimes I like
to drive around

10:27.827 --> 10:29.262
with only a quarter tank of gas.

10:29.262 --> 10:30.930
Miles, there's nothing I can say

10:30.930 --> 10:33.633
that's going to make you
more attractive to women.

10:35.435 --> 10:37.137
Still no Josh.

10:37.137 --> 10:39.839
You have one inattentive
boyfriend, Spellman.

10:39.839 --> 10:41.174
He has a very important job

10:41.174 --> 10:42.876
and I'm totally on board
with that.

10:42.876 --> 10:44.911
Believe me,
as soon as Mike can spare him

10:44.911 --> 10:45.945
Josh will be here.

10:45.945 --> 10:47.780
Josh hasn't spent
one moment with you

10:47.780 --> 10:48.781
since he got this job.

10:48.781 --> 10:51.284
If you keep being
so "on board"

10:51.284 --> 10:53.653
you're going to rationalize
your way out of a relationship.

10:53.653 --> 10:54.621
No, I'm not.

10:54.621 --> 10:56.055
And if we're
not together tonight

10:56.055 --> 10:57.524
we'll be together
tomorrow night.

10:57.524 --> 10:59.559
I'd rather have Josh
be successful at his job

10:59.559 --> 11:01.661
than jeopardize it
over a whiny girlfriend.

11:01.661 --> 11:03.963
There's nothing wrong
with being whiny.

11:03.963 --> 11:06.166
Or shrill.

11:06.332 --> 11:08.001
Hey, Sabrina.

11:09.269 --> 11:10.470
Harvey?

11:10.470 --> 11:12.572
Yeah, Morgan's
new boyfriend.

11:12.572 --> 11:14.307
Mike?

11:15.108 --> 11:17.744
Josh's new boyfriend.

11:17.744 --> 11:19.946
Mike, this is
Harvey and Morgan.

11:19.946 --> 11:21.147
Hey, all.

11:21.147 --> 11:22.148
I want to thank you

11:22.148 --> 11:23.650
for letting me borrow
your boyfriend.

11:23.650 --> 11:25.852
But I wanted to make sure
he didn't miss dinner, too.

11:25.852 --> 11:27.754
Well, thanks for getting him
here safe.

11:27.754 --> 11:30.490
Of course, he insisted
I join you, so...

11:30.657 --> 11:34.160
There's always tomorrow night.

11:34.594 --> 11:36.196
Yeah. See, my wife called

11:36.196 --> 11:38.932
and said I don't spend
enough time at home.

11:38.932 --> 11:41.734
Something about her "needs,"
bla-bla-bla.

11:41.734 --> 11:43.937
Long story short,
she threw me out.

11:43.937 --> 11:47.207
But Josh here was kind enough
to offer me his couch

11:47.207 --> 11:48.875
for as long as I need it.

11:48.875 --> 11:50.276
Oh, that is so sweet

11:50.276 --> 11:54.080
that you would rather stay
at Josh's place than a hotel

11:54.080 --> 11:56.216
which you can
obviously afford.

11:56.216 --> 12:00.453
That's the kind of guy I am.
I'm a people person.

12:00.453 --> 12:02.021
I propose a toast.

12:02.021 --> 12:05.091
To Mike and Josh.

12:05.091 --> 12:07.994
Come on, Sabrina.
Get on board.

12:14.567 --> 12:16.869
So, Mike's moving
in with you.

12:18.371 --> 12:20.173
He caught me
off guard, okay?

12:20.173 --> 12:21.274
As soon as we're done here

12:21.274 --> 12:22.875
I'm telling him
he can't stay with me.

12:22.875 --> 12:24.177
More importantly,
I'm quitting.

12:24.177 --> 12:25.311
This is way over the line.

12:25.311 --> 12:27.313
It isn't fair for me
and it isn't fair for you.

12:27.313 --> 12:29.515
You can't quit,
especially because of me.

12:29.515 --> 12:32.051
Let's not get into this
right now, with everybody here.

12:32.051 --> 12:33.686
Oh, don't worry about them.

12:33.686 --> 12:36.022
They've got other things
on their mind.

12:36.022 --> 12:38.691
Yo, what's with the salt?

12:38.691 --> 12:40.660
'Cause I love salt.

12:40.660 --> 12:42.262
Me, too.

12:42.262 --> 12:45.365
Salt scrubs, salt peels,
Salt Lake City.

12:45.365 --> 12:46.833
Hey, did you know
that salt

12:46.833 --> 12:48.468
is the most
important compound

12:48.468 --> 12:50.136
in the human body
after water?

12:50.136 --> 12:52.739
My whole reason for staying
in Boston was to be with you

12:52.739 --> 12:55.441
and with Mike hogging my sofa,
that's not going to happen.

12:55.441 --> 12:58.478
Josh, I feel guilty enough
that you gave up Prague for me.

12:58.478 --> 13:00.313
Just don't
do anything rash, okay?

13:00.313 --> 13:01.981
Somehow this will all work out.

13:01.981 --> 13:03.049
How?

13:03.049 --> 13:05.084
I'll think of something.

13:05.084 --> 13:07.587
I just haven't
put my finger on it yet.

13:08.221 --> 13:10.023
SALEM:
<i>Sabrina, it's obvious.</i>

13:10.023 --> 13:11.491
Mike is spending
so much time with Josh

13:11.491 --> 13:13.926
because his home life
is miserable.

13:13.926 --> 13:14.994
You're right.

13:14.994 --> 13:16.162
I've just got to find a spell

13:16.162 --> 13:17.730
to get Mike and his wife
back together.

13:17.730 --> 13:18.898
Look at this.

13:18.898 --> 13:20.767
An "I Got You, Babe" spell.

13:20.767 --> 13:21.701
Perfect.

13:24.270 --> 13:26.072
They've got to be kidding.

13:26.072 --> 13:27.740
Roll with it,
gypsy woman!

13:27.740 --> 13:28.908
The beat goes on.

13:28.908 --> 13:31.411
This one goes out
to Mike and Mike's wife.

13:31.577 --> 13:35.114
♪ They say we're young
and we don't know ♪

13:35.114 --> 13:39.986

14:02.141 --> 14:02.675
I'll see you
in the morning.

14:02.675 --> 14:04.911
Whoa, you're not going
to bed already, are you?

14:04.911 --> 14:06.512
Apparently not.

14:06.512 --> 14:07.880
( <i>phone rings</i> )

14:07.880 --> 14:09.082
Please be a telemarketer.

14:09.082 --> 14:10.683
Hello?

14:10.683 --> 14:11.984
Uh, yeah.

14:11.984 --> 14:13.319
Hey, it's your wife, Janine.

14:13.319 --> 14:16.556
Yeah, well, you tell that
miserable, nagging shrew...

14:16.556 --> 14:18.191

14:18.191 --> 14:20.126

14:21.894 --> 14:23.162
Uh, okay.

14:23.162 --> 14:24.697
Better yet,
let me tell her.

14:24.697 --> 14:26.399
Do you mind?

14:27.400 --> 14:28.901
Maybe Sabrina was right.

14:28.901 --> 14:30.436
This really will work out.

14:30.436 --> 14:32.004
( <i>"I Got You, Babe" playing</i> )

14:32.004 --> 14:33.573
It's 3:00 in the morning.

14:33.573 --> 14:35.842
Who's playing Sonny and Cher?

14:35.842 --> 14:37.443
Hey!

14:38.678 --> 14:40.513
Now, your sister
claims that a man

14:40.513 --> 14:42.482
should be confident
and self-assured

14:42.482 --> 14:45.051
and wow the women with
his masculine charisma.

14:45.051 --> 14:47.220
Have you seen
the Eurotrash she goes out with?

14:47.220 --> 14:49.122
No woman with
an ounce of self-respect

14:49.122 --> 14:50.156
would fall for that.

14:50.156 --> 14:52.859
A man needs to be aloof,
insensitive.

14:52.859 --> 14:55.528
If you want to get
a woman's attention, ignore her.

14:55.528 --> 14:57.597
My frontal lobe
is beginning to throb.

14:57.597 --> 14:58.431
That's because you're paying

14:58.431 --> 15:00.099
way too much attention
to what I'm saying.

15:00.099 --> 15:03.669
Ignore me, scorn me,
and then I'll be yours forever.

15:05.571 --> 15:08.107
Hey, I had a feeling
I'd be seeing you today.

15:08.107 --> 15:09.442
Let me guess--
you're finally

15:09.442 --> 15:11.277
going to whisk me away
to that picnic in the park?

15:11.277 --> 15:12.879
Mike and his wife
got back together.

15:12.879 --> 15:14.647
I know...
I mean, I'm shocked!

15:14.647 --> 15:15.648
No, here's the shocker.

15:15.648 --> 15:17.150
Now she's hanging around
the office

15:17.150 --> 15:18.551
and they're screaming
and yelling

15:18.551 --> 15:19.786
and putting me
in the middle.

15:19.786 --> 15:20.887
Now I really am shocked.

15:20.887 --> 15:22.221
Would you excuse me a moment?

15:22.221 --> 15:24.757
Um, I got to help Aunt Hilda
with this big coffee order.

15:24.757 --> 15:26.492
She tends to cap
when she should frap.

15:26.492 --> 15:28.761
Aunt Hilda,
you got to help me.

15:28.761 --> 15:30.430
I put an "I've
Got You, Babe" spell

15:30.430 --> 15:31.697
on Josh's boss
and his wife

15:31.697 --> 15:33.132
and it just
made things worse.

15:33.132 --> 15:34.333
Duh-- that spell only works

15:34.333 --> 15:36.702
if they're both willing to
put their stubbornness aside

15:36.702 --> 15:38.304
and admit that
they love each other.

15:38.304 --> 15:39.572
Well, if they could do that

15:39.572 --> 15:41.374
then I wouldn't have
needed the spell.

15:41.374 --> 15:42.508
Double duh.

15:42.508 --> 15:44.477
If I could fix
relationships
with a spell

15:44.477 --> 15:46.979
I'd still be with
Alexander the Great.

15:47.180 --> 15:49.882
He really was <i>great.</i>

15:54.420 --> 15:56.489
Maybe it's not
Mike's marriage
that's the problem.

15:56.489 --> 15:57.523
Maybe it's just Mike.

15:57.523 --> 15:58.791
The guy needs to get a life.

15:58.791 --> 16:00.226
You're in luck.

16:00.226 --> 16:02.028
Here's a "Get a Life" spell

16:02.028 --> 16:05.665
guaranteed to give the recipient
a meaningful existence

16:05.665 --> 16:07.967
and help him reform
his priorities.

16:07.967 --> 16:10.303
And now it comes in
a tasty cereal form.

16:16.008 --> 16:17.877
But what if he doesn't like it?

16:18.478 --> 16:19.612
He likes it.

16:19.612 --> 16:22.348
Hey, Mikey,
let me have some.

16:22.348 --> 16:23.549
Too late.

16:23.549 --> 16:25.218
It's all gone.

16:25.218 --> 16:26.819
You know what?

16:26.819 --> 16:29.121
I think I'm going
to go outside for a while

16:29.121 --> 16:31.324
take the rest of
the afternoon off

16:31.324 --> 16:33.559
do me some living.

16:36.462 --> 16:37.630
Hey, Sabrina, great news.

16:37.630 --> 16:39.131
Mike just took
the afternoon off.

16:39.131 --> 16:41.300
Any chance you can get away
for a little while?

16:41.300 --> 16:43.836
Oh, I think I can manage it.

16:50.710 --> 16:52.144
Surprise!

16:52.345 --> 16:54.313
Unfortunately, I've
got one for you, too.

16:54.313 --> 16:58.351
Hey, it's the girlfriend,
and she's come bearing gifts.

16:58.351 --> 16:59.819
I love this kid.

16:59.819 --> 17:01.854
I'm running out of spells,
here, buddy.

17:01.854 --> 17:04.156
Mike, um, I'm surprised
to see you here today.

17:04.156 --> 17:05.791
It seems like
such a perfect day

17:05.791 --> 17:07.627
to refocus one's priorities.

17:07.627 --> 17:08.861
A little while ago

17:08.861 --> 17:11.030
I was sitting in the park,
smelling the roses

17:11.030 --> 17:13.766
and then it hit me--
I don't need to get a life.

17:13.766 --> 17:16.402
I've already got one:
the newspaper.

17:16.869 --> 17:19.305
Doh, I should have
seen that coming.

17:19.305 --> 17:20.873
You know,
when I got married

17:20.873 --> 17:22.909
I told my wife,
"Work comes first."

17:22.909 --> 17:24.443
It's my one true passion.

17:24.443 --> 17:27.013
I'm a newspaper man,
just like Josh, here.

17:27.013 --> 17:29.148
Look, Mike, I'm
not like you
at all, all right?

17:29.148 --> 17:30.283
When I'm not on the clock

17:30.283 --> 17:32.318
and there's nothing
going on, I'm out of here.

17:32.318 --> 17:33.553
If you need me,
then page me

17:33.553 --> 17:35.121
but it better be
to take a picture.

17:35.121 --> 17:37.123
Listen, kid, with
that kind of attitude...

17:37.123 --> 17:39.659
I'll probably be
very happy, all right?

17:39.659 --> 17:41.027
If you don't like it,
then fire me

17:41.027 --> 17:43.429
'cause this is one
newspaper man who's
going to get a life.

17:43.429 --> 17:46.866
Have you been
eating Mikey's cereal?

17:48.834 --> 17:51.304
Sabrina, that picnic
was so worth waiting for.

17:51.304 --> 17:53.706
I'd rather lie on
a blanket with you any day

17:53.706 --> 17:56.075
than watch Mike
pick black beans
out of his teeth.

17:56.075 --> 17:59.378
Aw, that's the sweetest thing
anyone's ever said to me.

17:59.745 --> 18:02.214
I'm going to go down
to the paper and
clean out my cubby.

18:02.214 --> 18:04.417
Josh, I'm so sorry
about your job.

18:04.417 --> 18:06.085
Hey, don't worry
about it, all right?

18:06.085 --> 18:07.153
There'll be other jobs.

18:07.153 --> 18:09.188
The most important thing
is that I have you.

18:09.188 --> 18:11.157
You've been so great
through all this.

18:11.157 --> 18:13.459
I mean, even when
everything got totally crazy

18:13.459 --> 18:15.962
you just stayed calm
and didn't try to interfere.

18:15.962 --> 18:19.298
That's just
the kind of person I am.

18:19.298 --> 18:22.134
Thanks, Sabrina, you're
always there for me.

18:25.638 --> 18:27.607
And I'll continue to be there.

18:32.278 --> 18:34.013
Well, first I got
to straighten out Mike

18:34.013 --> 18:35.481
then I got to get
someone in here

18:35.481 --> 18:37.483
to straighten out Josh's cubby.

18:49.095 --> 18:50.730
What are you doing here?

18:50.730 --> 18:52.264
Maybe an "All is Forgiven" spell

18:52.264 --> 18:53.599
or a "Starting Over" spell.

18:53.599 --> 18:55.434
Don't get
your newsprint
in a wad.

18:55.434 --> 18:57.436
I'll be out of here
in two minutes.

18:57.436 --> 18:58.704
Good, 'cause
I don't pay you

18:58.704 --> 18:59.939
to hang around the office.

18:59.939 --> 19:01.273
I need you
down at the docks

19:01.273 --> 19:02.675
covering that
industrial fire.

19:02.675 --> 19:04.043
You mean I still
have my job?

19:04.043 --> 19:07.046
No, I just enjoy sending people
down to the docks.

19:07.046 --> 19:09.849
Of course you still
have your job.

19:09.849 --> 19:11.984
Mike, I love working here

19:11.984 --> 19:13.719
but I'm not apologizing
for what I said

19:13.719 --> 19:15.287
and I'm not going
to be hanging out

19:15.287 --> 19:16.522
when I'm not on the clock.

19:16.522 --> 19:17.556
Whoo-hoo!

19:17.556 --> 19:18.724
( <i>whispering</i> ):
I mean, whoo-hoo.

19:18.724 --> 19:20.459
That's what I like
about you, kid.

19:20.459 --> 19:21.761
You stand up for yourself

19:21.761 --> 19:23.629
and you do it
for the right reasons.

19:23.629 --> 19:26.065
In my book, that's what
makes a newspaper man.

19:26.065 --> 19:27.733
Yeah, well, I still
got a lot to learn

19:27.733 --> 19:30.202
and as far as I'm concerned,
you're the guy to teach me.

19:30.202 --> 19:31.837
Yeah, well, not tonight,
all right?

19:31.837 --> 19:33.305
I'm taking my wife to a play

19:33.305 --> 19:35.007
and being the romantic that I am

19:35.007 --> 19:37.209
I'm picking her up afterward.

19:38.210 --> 19:40.479
Hey, I want you
to hang on to this one.

19:40.479 --> 19:41.480
Oh! Ow!

19:41.580 --> 19:42.348
She's a keeper.

19:42.348 --> 19:45.618
I know, I know.

19:48.587 --> 19:50.456
Sabrina, you're not
going to believe this.

19:50.456 --> 19:51.590
I still have my job.

19:51.590 --> 19:53.926
Oh, that's great news.

19:53.926 --> 19:54.760
Are you okay?

19:54.760 --> 19:55.895
Oh, fine.

19:55.895 --> 19:58.030
I just got the wind
poked out of me.

20:05.037 --> 20:06.338
Sabrina,
you got to help me.

20:06.338 --> 20:08.574
Miles, I already told you,
a Q-tip and a smile.

20:08.574 --> 20:10.309
No, today's the big day.

20:10.309 --> 20:13.479
Over there is
Mary Quizzenberry

20:13.479 --> 20:15.614
and in here is
the wisdom and knowledge

20:15.614 --> 20:17.583
that I've gleaned
from the fair sex.

20:17.583 --> 20:19.485
Oh, and you want me
to videotape the moment

20:19.485 --> 20:20.786
when she falls
into your arms

20:20.786 --> 20:22.254
and you ride off
into the sunset?

20:22.254 --> 20:24.490
I'll settle for buying her
a cup of decaf.

20:24.490 --> 20:27.359
Okay, here goes.

20:27.359 --> 20:31.097
You are looking at a confident,
charismatic, clean-eared man

20:31.097 --> 20:34.600
who's dangerous,
yet mysteriously aloof.

20:35.868 --> 20:37.503
Why do I feel like
this is going to be

20:37.503 --> 20:40.239
an incredibly short version
of the <i>Titanic?</i>

20:40.239 --> 20:42.641
Hello, I'm...

20:43.042 --> 20:46.445
I'm not going to tell you
who I am, right away

20:46.445 --> 20:48.280
because I'm slightly mysterious

20:48.280 --> 20:50.983
but I must warn you,
I'm also dangerous

20:50.983 --> 20:54.186
and you could eat
out of this ear.

20:54.186 --> 20:57.289
Ooh, I think we just
hit an iceberg!

20:57.289 --> 20:59.125
Want to have coffee?

20:59.125 --> 21:00.860
Are you insane?

21:00.860 --> 21:04.330
There's absolutely no way
I'd go out for coffee with you.

21:04.330 --> 21:08.067
Didn't think so.

21:08.067 --> 21:10.569
Time to bring out the lifeboats.

21:12.204 --> 21:13.239
Hey.

21:13.405 --> 21:14.240
Yeah?

21:14.240 --> 21:16.609
I am free for dinner tonight.

21:24.416 --> 21:26.519
I love a happy ending.
