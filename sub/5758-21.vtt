00:00.747 --> 00:02.499
Previously on Pretty Little Liars...

00:02.500 --> 00:05.000
I thought Wilden got 
Ali pregnant and killed her.

00:05.001 --> 00:06.428
- So is it true?
- I don't know what's true.

00:06.429 --> 00:08.335
Wilden's sure going out
of his way to deny it.

00:08.336 --> 00:10.308
Either you shut Hanna up, or I will!

00:10.836 --> 00:11.658
Aah!

00:12.967 --> 00:15.834
Is everything okay? My
mom owns Maggie's condo,

00:15.835 --> 00:17.336
and she's selling it. What?

00:17.596 --> 00:19.840
Do you still have any friends, Spencer?

00:19.841 --> 00:21.868
You are not taking away any more of them.

00:21.869 --> 00:23.521
Who's looking cray-cray now?

00:23.522 --> 00:25.157
Aah! Aah! Stop!

00:25.869 --> 00:26.539
Where is Wilden?

00:27.308 --> 00:28.335
I don't know.

00:31.033 --> 00:32.034
What happened?

00:32.253 --> 00:34.914
Can you call Hanna and Emily? Why?

00:35.162 --> 00:36.477
I know who's helping Mona.

00:39.787 --> 00:41.823
Oh, my God. Are you all right?

00:42.047 --> 00:44.041
Yeah. Thank God Aria got here when she did.

00:44.394 --> 00:45.905
Where's Hanna? I don't know.

00:45.906 --> 00:47.693
She won't answer any of my texts or calls.

00:48.977 --> 00:51.539
So, who is it? Who's helping Mona?

00:53.089 --> 00:54.669
We should wait for Hanna. No,

00:54.670 --> 00:55.968
this is too important to wait.

00:57.816 --> 00:59.274
Okay, but you guys need to know that

00:59.275 --> 01:00.787
I've been warned not to tell you.

01:01.653 --> 01:02.795
What else is new?

01:03.027 --> 01:03.724
Wait minute.

01:03.725 --> 01:05.199
You knew who it was before tonight?

01:07.152 --> 01:08.354
Yeah. I've known for a few weeks.

01:09.532 --> 01:11.394
Why didn't you tell us any sooner?

01:12.576 --> 01:13.821
I wanted to be sure.

01:14.726 --> 01:17.016
I didn't want to believe
that it could be true,

01:17.017 --> 01:20.001
but after tonight happened,

01:21.006 --> 01:22.732
I can't keep this to myself anymore.

01:28.389 --> 01:29.537
Toby is "A."

01:44.312 --> 01:45.694
He must have been taken to a hospital.

01:45.695 --> 01:48.164
Or he's in the woods somewhere
and we just can't find him.

01:49.981 --> 01:50.740
What are you doing?

01:51.172 --> 01:52.695
Calling Rosewood hospital...

01:54.044 --> 01:54.984
And then my lawyer.

01:55.796 --> 01:58.626
No! You cannot do that! Why not?

01:58.627 --> 02:00.559
Because if Wilden is still alive somewhere,

02:00.560 --> 02:01.898
we don't know what he'll say or do.

02:02.398 --> 02:04.560
Hanna, I hit a man.

02:05.751 --> 02:07.492
Not just any man... I hit a cop.

02:07.740 --> 02:08.883
He was threatening you.

02:09.154 --> 02:10.497
I left the scene of an accident.

02:10.499 --> 02:12.266
Which is why you can't
admit to what you've done

02:12.267 --> 02:14.510
until we know exactly
what we're dealing with.

02:15.459 --> 02:18.439
I was scared. He was reaching for his gun.

02:18.440 --> 02:20.274
I-I thought he was reaching for his gun!

02:20.275 --> 02:23.467
I know. But whatever he did or
didn't do, you still hit him.

02:24.622 --> 02:26.296
And once you tell the
police or your lawyer,

02:26.297 --> 02:27.305
there's no going back.

02:39.003 --> 02:40.779
Okay. Hanna...

02:41.278 --> 02:43.357
Until we know what our next step is...

02:45.601 --> 02:48.587
Not a word about this to your friends.

02:48.588 --> 02:50.489
Understood? Yes, of course.

02:50.490 --> 02:51.752
Hanna, I mean it.

02:52.023 --> 02:52.775
Nothing.

02:53.998 --> 02:54.830
I promise.

03:37.409 --> 03:42.309

<font color="#40bfff">www.Addic7ed.com</font>

03:44.917 --> 03:46.000
So, what are we saying?

03:47.500 --> 03:50.348
That what Ali wrote in
Emily's notebook was true?

03:51.358 --> 03:53.166
That Toby's secretly hated us ever since

03:53.167 --> 03:55.204
Ali threw that firecracker in his garage?

03:55.691 --> 03:58.210
Yeah, I guess so. And the whole time

03:58.211 --> 04:00.551
that you two... were together,

04:00.552 --> 04:01.657
he was just pretending.

04:02.115 --> 04:04.267
Okay, we all know how much Toby loves you.

04:04.711 --> 04:07.005
This can't be true. There has
to be more to the story.

04:07.006 --> 04:10.594
If he loved me, he would not have
let me sit outside of his loft

04:10.595 --> 04:12.723
bawling my eyes out for hours.

04:13.176 --> 04:14.559
Okay? He wouldn't have taken everything

04:14.560 --> 04:16.651
out of "A's" lair when he
knew that I had the key.

04:16.652 --> 04:19.880
He wouldn't be trying to hurt me... us!

04:22.695 --> 04:24.275
I am so sorry, Spence.

04:25.409 --> 04:26.929
Mona must have something over him.

04:27.537 --> 04:29.862
Trust me, I have tried to come up with

04:29.863 --> 04:32.741
every possible explanation as
to why he could be doing this,

04:32.742 --> 04:34.813
and it all leads back
to the same conclusion.

04:35.062 --> 04:38.070
Toby, I know, what would never
do anything to hurt any of us.

04:42.995 --> 04:43.878
What's so funny?

04:44.785 --> 04:47.806
You. You trying to make sense of this.

04:49.014 --> 04:51.080
You need to stop thinking about Toby

04:51.081 --> 04:52.441
as the person that you thought you knew

04:52.442 --> 04:54.579
and start looking at him
for who he really is.

04:54.835 --> 04:55.853
And how do I do that?

04:55.854 --> 04:57.484
You look at the facts, Emily!

04:57.485 --> 04:59.824
Okay. Which are?

05:00.073 --> 05:02.583
Mona is with the decathlon
team in New York City.

05:02.865 --> 05:04.804
She couldn't have locked me
in the steam room,

05:04.805 --> 05:06.183
and that leaves Toby.

05:08.621 --> 05:10.938
The quicker you wrap your
mind around this, the better.

05:35.329 --> 05:36.427
Toby, it's Emily.

05:37.430 --> 05:38.566
I really want to talk to you.

05:39.670 --> 05:40.826
I need to talk to you.

05:42.021 --> 05:43.080
Please call me back.

06:09.724 --> 06:11.354
Hey, babe... boy: Hello.

06:14.005 --> 06:15.203
Hi there!

06:16.129 --> 06:18.231
I'm guessing you didn't get my voicemail.

06:18.504 --> 06:22.118
Huh. I just called a seven-year-old "babe."

06:23.625 --> 06:25.304
So... Malcolm.

06:25.305 --> 06:27.649
This... Is Aria.

06:28.601 --> 06:29.799
Nice to meet you.

06:30.701 --> 06:32.705
It is so nice to meet you too, Malcolm.

06:34.631 --> 06:36.353
Tell you what. Why don't you
go sort out those cars?

06:36.354 --> 06:38.075
They're looking pretty jumbled over there.

06:41.693 --> 06:42.776
So...

06:43.418 --> 06:44.857
When did all this happen?

06:44.858 --> 06:46.755
I talked to you like ten hours ago.

06:47.464 --> 06:48.968
Maggie and Malcolm came up this morning.

06:48.969 --> 06:50.560
It was kind of a spur
of the moment decision.

06:52.207 --> 06:52.918
For how long?

06:54.118 --> 06:55.181
Ah, a few days.

06:58.614 --> 07:00.353
Since they're getting displaced,

07:00.354 --> 07:03.786
Maggie thought she'd put some
feelers out in the area for a job.

07:04.333 --> 07:07.720
And then if she finds one, she
thinks moving to Rosewood

07:07.721 --> 07:09.902
might be the best thing for everyone.

07:13.198 --> 07:14.877
They're... they're gonna be staying here?

07:16.110 --> 07:18.763
Oh, no, no. Maggie's dropping her
bags off at a hotel right now.

07:19.020 --> 07:19.676
Oh, good.

07:20.930 --> 07:22.474
I...Just mean that your

07:22.475 --> 07:24.515
place is a little small
for the three of you.

07:25.034 --> 07:25.664
Yeah.

07:28.126 --> 07:30.332
Malcolm and I were just about to
put the last of the tracks down.

07:31.345 --> 07:33.386
Oh, I can go. I'm sure that

07:33.387 --> 07:35.078
you want to spend some alone-time with him.

07:35.079 --> 07:35.774
Well, actually, I was...

07:37.212 --> 07:38.755
I was hoping you could
hang out for a little bit?

07:39.130 --> 07:40.435
Get to know Malcolm?

07:40.436 --> 07:44.543
I...Can't imagine that Maggie
would be too happy about that.

07:45.216 --> 07:48.116
Aria, Maggie knows exactly
who you are in my life.

07:48.602 --> 07:49.991
Believe me, she's fine with you being here.

07:51.507 --> 07:52.218
What do you say?

07:56.270 --> 07:58.777
Come on! You gotta check out my train set!

08:02.279 --> 08:03.164
Okay!

08:11.333 --> 08:12.203
Oh-and-one count...

08:13.799 --> 08:15.624
Toby's clothes and books
are still up there.

08:15.857 --> 08:17.441
It's like he ran out and never looked back.

08:18.183 --> 08:19.084
Did you find anything?

08:21.432 --> 08:22.517
Hello? Earth to Hanna!

08:24.673 --> 08:26.114
Since when do you watch the news?

08:27.208 --> 08:28.042
What?

08:30.462 --> 08:31.775
Oh. No. Uh...

08:31.776 --> 08:33.993
I was just... I wanted
to check the weather.

08:33.994 --> 08:36.195
What the hell are you doing?
You're supposed to be helping me!

08:36.196 --> 08:37.376
Look, I looked!

08:37.923 --> 08:39.217
I didn't find anything.

08:39.501 --> 08:40.808
Really? 'Cause I coulda sworn

08:40.808 --> 08:42.977
you were sitting in that
exact spot 20 minutes ago.

08:46.159 --> 08:48.085
Okay, maybe I didn't try hard enough.

08:48.086 --> 08:49.593
But the more I think about it,

08:50.597 --> 08:52.536
the more I think we should
stop searching for him.

08:53.059 --> 08:55.120
If Spencer's right, Toby is dangerous.

08:55.121 --> 08:57.484
If he's so dangerous, then how
come he's never hurt any of us?

08:58.065 --> 08:59.568
I've been alone with him
how many times now?

08:59.569 --> 09:01.169
No more than I've been alone with Mona.

09:02.693 --> 09:05.323
Wait. Did you forget that he tried
to kill Spencer last night?

09:05.324 --> 09:07.715
She believes he tried to kill her.
She didn't see him.

09:07.716 --> 09:10.081
She saw him in her kitchen
dressed in a black hoodie.

09:10.292 --> 09:12.474
That doesn't mean he's physically
trying to harm any of us.

09:12.931 --> 09:15.157
Lucas was blackmailed into doing
things for Mona, remember?

09:16.073 --> 09:18.431
We still don't know what part
Toby is playing in all this.

09:22.697 --> 09:24.053
We told each other everything.

09:25.523 --> 09:27.899
He gave me the courage to come out.

09:35.415 --> 09:37.493
I gave this to him for
his birthday last year.

09:44.568 --> 09:45.258
What's that?

09:46.197 --> 09:47.253
Parking pass.

09:47.921 --> 09:49.385
Who's "E. Lamb"?

09:50.904 --> 09:52.757
Spencer said that's what
Toby called himself

09:52.758 --> 09:54.117
to get in and out of Radley.

09:57.737 --> 09:59.126
Look, if you really want to find him,

10:00.436 --> 10:02.683
why don't you just start
by talking to his parents?

10:06.963 --> 10:07.795
Perfect.

10:11.280 --> 10:12.852
All aboard!

10:19.606 --> 10:21.764
Next stop, union station.

10:28.047 --> 10:29.281
Hi, sweetie!

10:29.282 --> 10:30.668
Hi, mommy!

10:32.024 --> 10:33.776
Oh! I missed you.

10:34.033 --> 10:35.359
Are you having so much fun?

10:35.643 --> 10:37.219
Aria's the conductor!

10:37.752 --> 10:39.012
Well, I bet she's a good one.

10:39.898 --> 10:40.895
Hey, Malcolm,

10:41.155 --> 10:43.902
why don't we wash up before we eat, yeah?

10:49.751 --> 10:50.605
Maggie.

10:53.958 --> 10:56.018
Um... How are you?

10:56.513 --> 10:58.657
I'm good, thanks. You?

10:58.658 --> 11:00.196
Good. Great.

11:04.564 --> 11:06.598
Look, I just wanted you to know

11:06.633 --> 11:09.583
that it wasn't me that
told Ezra about Malcolm.

11:09.584 --> 11:10.492
Aria, it's okay.

11:10.603 --> 11:12.949
As much as I wanted Ezra to know about him,

11:13.491 --> 11:15.174
I would never do that.

11:15.388 --> 11:17.929
Really, I'm not upset.

11:18.890 --> 11:19.978
To be honest, seeing the way

11:19.979 --> 11:22.590
that Ezra and Malcolm have
bonded over the past few weeks,

11:23.802 --> 11:25.375
I wish I had told him sooner.

11:26.268 --> 11:28.016
All right, let's go get this.

11:28.031 --> 11:30.266
Um, hey, I spoke to Janet,

11:30.300 --> 11:32.201
and she thinks that she
might have a lead on a job.

11:32.235 --> 11:34.095
I was gonna grab coffee with her at four.

11:34.871 --> 11:37.840
Oh. Um, I'm tutoring then.

11:38.095 --> 11:40.286
Can you push it back an hour?

11:40.348 --> 11:42.112
It's the only time she's free today.

11:43.412 --> 11:46.369
I-I can try and find somebody
to watch Malcolm, or I could...

11:46.370 --> 11:47.249
I can watch him.

11:49.293 --> 11:51.546
Uh... I mean... you don't have to do that.

11:51.547 --> 11:53.549
Really. No, it's no problem.

11:53.770 --> 11:54.812
It'll be a lot of fun.

11:55.618 --> 11:57.886
Thank you. That's a big help.

12:56.450 --> 12:58.421
***

12:58.490 --> 13:01.623
If I ratted out "T," "A" was
gonna take one of my three.

13:01.917 --> 13:03.797
She's just trying to scare us.

13:03.860 --> 13:05.266
Well, it's working.

13:05.568 --> 13:08.269
You need to stop looking for Toby.
Just let it go.

13:08.489 --> 13:10.125
You're looking for Toby? Why?

13:10.238 --> 13:12.234
It's not that I don't
believe what you saw, okay?

13:12.235 --> 13:15.273
But he's my friend too, so I
need to hear this from him.

13:15.393 --> 13:18.534
Okay, I understand that, but
I looked for him for weeks.

13:18.914 --> 13:20.752
Trust me, he doesn't want to be found.

13:21.033 --> 13:22.220
Mona: Thank you.

13:25.414 --> 13:26.961
How long has she been standing there?

13:30.853 --> 13:32.821
Spencer, wait. What are you doing?

13:34.366 --> 13:37.982
Hello. You're not planning on
choking me again, are you?

13:37.997 --> 13:41.840
No. I just wanted to say
thank you for the flowers.

13:42.135 --> 13:44.119
The orchids are especially beautiful.

13:44.472 --> 13:47.674
I have no idea what you're talking about.

13:47.675 --> 13:50.002
Might be time to visit
your doctor friend again.

13:50.016 --> 13:53.314
Listen to me, Mona. I'm not playing around.

13:53.590 --> 13:55.185
Do not hurt my friends.

13:55.880 --> 13:57.867
If you so much as touch
one hair on their heads,

13:57.868 --> 13:59.797
I will make you very sorry.

14:00.102 --> 14:01.173
Am I clear?

14:02.935 --> 14:06.005
Looks like someone's been skipping
their anger management class.

14:07.042 --> 14:09.073
I think I'll take my pumpkin latte...

14:10.653 --> 14:11.232
To go.

14:13.409 --> 14:13.946
Oh...

14:15.272 --> 14:18.466
But a little tip on the orchids.

14:18.673 --> 14:21.255
Make sure not to leave
them in direct sunlight.

14:22.036 --> 14:25.828
I did once; They didn't
make it through the night.

14:50.640 --> 14:51.322
Ella: Hey.

14:53.181 --> 14:55.146
I can't believe your dad
kept all that stuff.

14:55.147 --> 14:55.790
Hi!

14:57.111 --> 14:58.242
What are you doing here?

14:58.391 --> 15:00.675
I was just picking up
some old tax receipts.

15:00.676 --> 15:02.794
What's with the trip down memory Lane?

15:03.008 --> 15:04.874
Oh, this? I just...

15:05.866 --> 15:08.490
Emily started baby-sitting,
and so she was wondering

15:08.491 --> 15:10.611
if I had anything that would
keep a little boy occupied.

15:10.797 --> 15:13.675
Emily? I thought she was
working at the brew.

15:13.850 --> 15:14.644
Did I say Emily?

15:15.725 --> 15:17.119
I-I meant Hanna.

15:18.708 --> 15:20.479
Um, Ezra called and left me a message.

15:20.514 --> 15:23.415
He wanted to know if I knew of
any open teaching positions

15:23.450 --> 15:25.676
for his friend named Maggie.
Do you know her?

15:26.152 --> 15:28.232
No. I've never met her.

15:29.734 --> 15:32.554
Oh. Well, I'll call him and tell
him I'll keep my ears open.

15:32.694 --> 15:33.491
I can tell him.

15:35.346 --> 15:37.469
Well, I'm... I'm gonna see him
later and he's busy now tutoring,

15:37.470 --> 15:39.109
so he won't pick up if you call.

15:42.077 --> 15:43.105
Is everything okay?

15:43.343 --> 15:45.569
Yeah. Yeah, everything's perfect.

15:48.917 --> 15:50.060
All right, well, I'm gonna go.

15:50.061 --> 15:51.448
I gotta get this stuff to Hanna.

15:52.401 --> 15:53.065
Aria.

15:56.569 --> 15:57.904
You forgot your ball.

16:01.052 --> 16:03.071
Thanks. Bye.

16:38.508 --> 16:41.164
Hey... Are you a friend of Toby's?

16:42.733 --> 16:43.512
I work with him.

16:44.536 --> 16:45.778
Do you know where he is right now?

16:46.160 --> 16:47.656
I haven't seen him in a couple of weeks.

16:48.030 --> 16:50.185
He had some sort of
emergency, left me his truck

16:50.219 --> 16:51.792
and asked me to finish a job for him.

16:51.888 --> 16:53.446
Did he say where he was going?

16:53.717 --> 16:55.876
Sorry. I'm just here to
pick up a table saw.

17:34.828 --> 17:38.350
Yeah, there's nothing in the papers either.

17:38.351 --> 17:41.055
I-I don't know what to think.

17:42.149 --> 17:44.168
All right, Hanna, I need
to get back to work.

17:44.320 --> 17:45.337
I'll see you tonight.

18:15.408 --> 18:16.918
What am I supposed
to be looking at?

18:17.321 --> 18:18.631
Notice how all the letters

18:18.632 --> 18:20.481
are shiny except for
the "T" and the "M"?

18:20.571 --> 18:21.853
I don't know how I missed it this morning,

18:21.887 --> 18:23.238
but I saw it when I got home.

18:24.256 --> 18:25.207
So what?

18:25.593 --> 18:28.025
So Mona is trying to tell
us in her cryptic way

18:28.026 --> 18:29.780
that she's targeting you next.

18:30.227 --> 18:31.946
I'm sure it's just a coincidence.

18:32.125 --> 18:34.051
There are no coincidences with "A."

18:35.186 --> 18:37.742
Spence, you've been through a
lot in the past few weeks.

18:37.743 --> 18:39.274
No, Emily, this makes sense.

18:39.275 --> 18:41.018
Mona knows that you're searching for Toby.

18:41.336 --> 18:43.234
I saw her stare at you in
the brew this morning,

18:43.235 --> 18:44.218
and now this.

18:45.233 --> 18:46.632
Okay, I'll keep my eyes open.

18:46.633 --> 18:47.651
No. She made it seem like

18:47.652 --> 18:49.281
something bad was gonna
happen to you tonight.

18:49.315 --> 18:51.315
Look, I'm gonna stay with you
for the rest of the day.

18:51.316 --> 18:54.097
I gotta get to swim practice.
Do not ignore this!

18:54.951 --> 18:57.676
I'm ignoring it, but we don't
know for sure what this means.

18:58.036 --> 18:59.684
Okay? Let me hang on to this.

18:59.914 --> 19:02.277
You don't need to be staring
at it for the rest of the day.

19:04.625 --> 19:06.884
At least promise me that
you'll stop looking for Toby.

19:08.293 --> 19:11.117
Fine. I'll stop looking for him.

19:12.950 --> 19:14.934
Look, I'll call you when I get home, okay?

19:16.153 --> 19:16.766
Okay.

19:21.068 --> 19:22.431
How long has he been like that for?

19:22.976 --> 19:24.923
He's been on a raid for the past hour.

19:25.797 --> 19:27.297
I still cannot believe

19:27.298 --> 19:29.021
that you're baby-sitting
your boyfriend's kid.

19:30.127 --> 19:32.844
Well, I still can't believe
that my boyfriend has a kid.

19:34.027 --> 19:37.075
So what's gonna happen if
Malcolm and Maggie move here?

19:38.264 --> 19:38.987
What do you mean?

19:40.384 --> 19:43.294
Well, when they were in
Delaware, that was one thing,

19:43.295 --> 19:46.555
but if they come here, where
does that leave you and Ezra?

19:47.859 --> 19:48.920
I don't know.

19:50.190 --> 19:51.971
But we'll figure it out. We always do.

19:53.853 --> 19:55.213
And you're sure that Maggie's okay

19:55.214 --> 19:57.641
with you being part of the equation?

19:58.132 --> 19:59.084
She seems to be.

19:59.430 --> 20:01.375
I guess she's not who I thought she was.

20:02.361 --> 20:03.904
There's a lot of that going around.

20:13.214 --> 20:14.282
You know, I was thinking.

20:14.923 --> 20:17.045
If Toby is working with Mona,

20:17.832 --> 20:20.219
there had to have been
some signs that we missed.

20:20.271 --> 20:22.815
I always wondered how
Toby found Dr. Sullivan

20:23.103 --> 20:24.768
after Mona ran her out of town.

20:25.115 --> 20:26.562
And then he brought her

20:26.563 --> 20:28.485
back the exact night that Mona was caught.

20:28.539 --> 20:29.835
You think that it was planned?

20:30.219 --> 20:31.387
Well, I think that Mona knew

20:31.388 --> 20:33.256
we were getting close
to where the lair was.

20:33.938 --> 20:38.534
And bringing Dr. Sullivan
back helped Mona because...?

20:38.900 --> 20:41.162
She diagnosed her with a mental disorder.

20:43.255 --> 20:45.923
And that helped ensure that she
went to Radley, not to jail.

21:00.861 --> 21:01.993
Everything okay?

21:02.806 --> 21:03.731
What?

21:04.769 --> 21:07.655
Oh. Um... Yeah.

21:07.656 --> 21:09.781
No, I-I just completely forgot,

21:09.782 --> 21:11.669
I'm gonna be late to meet my mom,

21:11.670 --> 21:14.107
so I'll call you later, okay?

21:15.163 --> 21:16.367
Yeah, okay.

21:23.438 --> 21:25.038
Are you sure there's nothing you can do?

21:25.541 --> 21:27.141
Honey, I'm sure if Toby were really missing

21:27.142 --> 21:28.936
his family would have
filed a report by now.

21:28.937 --> 21:31.571
His family is away. Maybe he's with them.

21:32.188 --> 21:33.279
I don't think so.

21:33.372 --> 21:36.645
I'm assuming that you have called
him and tried to text him.

21:36.646 --> 21:37.959
Yeah, he's not responding.

21:38.937 --> 21:39.734
I'm worried. I don't think

21:39.735 --> 21:41.572
he took his break with Spencer very well.

21:42.899 --> 21:46.159
Honey, you have such a big heart,

21:46.487 --> 21:48.598
and you always see the best in everyone.

21:48.599 --> 21:52.314
But honestly, I wish that
you would just let this go.

21:53.919 --> 21:57.199
I don't trust Toby. I haven't
since he caused that fire.

21:59.840 --> 22:00.908
Rosewood police.

22:02.334 --> 22:04.050
Yes, miss Maloney,

22:04.051 --> 22:06.399
let me check on the status of that.

22:06.574 --> 22:07.921
All right, please hold.

22:09.206 --> 22:11.431
Mom, can I use your
computer to check my email?

22:11.627 --> 22:13.366
Yeah, just be quick about it.

22:30.629 --> 22:31.918
Hey, Spence, it's me.

22:32.060 --> 22:34.162
I'm just calling to check on you.

22:34.389 --> 22:35.404
Call me back.

22:36.555 --> 22:37.248
Hey, I'm gonna grab some

22:37.249 --> 22:39.669
juice boxes for us to
take to the park, okay?

22:42.485 --> 22:43.553
Oh, my God.

22:46.505 --> 22:48.703
What happened? Hey, come here.

22:50.448 --> 22:51.683
Oh, my God.

22:55.061 --> 22:56.233
Shh.

23:33.978 --> 23:34.568
You all right?

23:34.569 --> 23:35.786
Yeah. Almost done.

24:06.934 --> 24:07.926
Hello.

24:08.661 --> 24:09.822
Yeah, it's all here.

24:11.613 --> 24:12.739
I'm on my way.

24:43.764 --> 24:45.396
I should be banned from
ever being around kids.

24:45.397 --> 24:46.945
No, Aria, it's... it's okay.

24:46.977 --> 24:48.087
No, it's not!

24:48.611 --> 24:50.946
You have every right to be angry with me.

24:50.947 --> 24:53.608
I-I'm not angry. These things happen.

24:54.317 --> 24:56.472
He cut his chin. That's what
happens when you're a boy.

25:00.176 --> 25:03.359
So you were... talking
with Spencer when he fell?

25:03.623 --> 25:06.434
No. Like I said, I left
her a quick message,

25:06.435 --> 25:07.724
and then I hung up the phone.

25:09.394 --> 25:10.902
You didn't see him jumping on the bed?

25:10.903 --> 25:13.377
Ezra, by the time I turned
around, it was too late.

25:13.378 --> 25:16.193
So you weren't watching him the whole time.

25:16.323 --> 25:18.421
It sure sounds like you're angry at me.

25:20.830 --> 25:22.253
I just want to be clear on what happened

25:22.254 --> 25:24.043
so I know what to tell Maggie.

25:25.330 --> 25:27.191
Tell her that I feel like crap,

25:27.192 --> 25:29.398
that he son got hurt while
I was watching him.

25:29.399 --> 25:30.920
Tell her that it was my fault,

25:30.921 --> 25:32.297
I should have been paying closer attention,

25:32.298 --> 25:34.113
and tell her that I am so sorry...

25:34.813 --> 25:38.031
But I don't know the first
thing about being a parent.

25:41.934 --> 25:43.094
Neither do I.

26:33.028 --> 26:35.513
Mom, where are you? Call
me when you get this.

26:53.222 --> 26:54.756
Wilden: ...Compared to what
I'll do if Hanna talks.

26:54.757 --> 26:56.712
Ashley: I wonder how your
lieutenant will respond

26:56.713 --> 26:58.478
when he hears you're threatening a child.

26:58.635 --> 26:59.831
He's not going to.

27:01.016 --> 27:02.278
Think this through, Ashley.

27:02.792 --> 27:04.363
How do you live with yourself?

27:07.864 --> 27:09.164
Hey, we're not done here!

27:12.386 --> 27:14.564
Get out of my way! I can't let you go!

27:14.997 --> 27:16.099
Get out of my way!

27:16.100 --> 27:18.241
Either you shut Hanna up, or I will!

27:36.685 --> 27:38.870
You have arrived at your destination.

28:05.768 --> 28:07.385
Hey, you'll be back in action in no time.

28:07.386 --> 28:09.870
Mm-hmm. And Ezra says that when
you're feeling all better,

28:09.871 --> 28:12.710
he's gonna take you on a
trampoline for some real fun.

28:13.315 --> 28:14.310
I am?

28:15.406 --> 28:18.420
Yeah, Malcolm, we're gonna
be kings of that trampoline.

28:18.421 --> 28:19.487
Hey.

28:21.100 --> 28:23.113
Maggie, I am so sorry.

28:23.221 --> 28:25.581
Mommy's here. Are you feeling okay?

28:25.948 --> 28:27.908
He's fine. Just worn out.

28:28.339 --> 28:29.602
How bad was the cut?

28:29.719 --> 28:32.636
It wasn't bad. Just a few stitches.

28:32.806 --> 28:35.724
The doctor's gonna be back in
in a second to check on him.

28:38.382 --> 28:39.703
Are you immediate family?

28:40.919 --> 28:42.223
Um, no.

28:42.722 --> 28:44.353
Then you need to wait outside.

29:43.088 --> 29:44.109
Mona: He's dead.

29:50.573 --> 29:51.544
Mona!!!

29:55.090 --> 29:56.200
Mona!!!

31:01.904 --> 31:03.475
I'm sorry I

31:06.218 --> 31:07.296
are you mad?

31:08.149 --> 31:09.860
Mad? No.

31:10.400 --> 31:11.711
Sad, a little,

31:11.712 --> 31:14.773
because I don't know how to
help you with this situation.

31:16.408 --> 31:19.175
Am I just crazy to think
that this could work?

31:19.760 --> 31:21.913
It's definitely not gonna be easy.

31:22.456 --> 31:23.205
It was one thing when I thought

31:23.206 --> 31:24.819
that Ezra's son lived in Delaware,

31:24.820 --> 31:26.785
but if Malcolm and Maggie move here...

31:27.562 --> 31:29.832
It's gonna be even more complicated.

31:33.321 --> 31:35.416
Ezra seems really happy
to have him in his life.

31:36.242 --> 31:38.206
Well, having a child is great,

31:38.207 --> 31:40.198
but it completely changes your life.

31:40.662 --> 31:42.227
It stops being about what you want,

31:42.228 --> 31:43.827
and it starts being about

31:43.842 --> 31:46.514
what you can do to make
your child's life better.

31:47.255 --> 31:48.259
I know that...

31:49.923 --> 31:52.508
Things are gonna change
between us, obviously.

31:53.694 --> 31:55.242
I think the question is: How much?

31:55.926 --> 31:57.648
Well, what does Ezra say about this?

31:59.711 --> 32:00.619
Um...

32:02.468 --> 32:05.682
He thinks it can work if we both try.

32:07.046 --> 32:08.348
Maybe it can.

32:09.316 --> 32:12.342
But it's also okay if you don't want it to.

32:17.965 --> 32:19.131
I love him.

32:20.964 --> 32:22.238
I know you do.

32:24.247 --> 32:27.975
But not every relationship
is meant to last forever.

32:30.645 --> 32:34.358
And sometimes the best thing
you can do is take a step back

32:34.395 --> 32:36.338
and give yourself a chance to breathe.

33:31.893 --> 33:32.866
Excuse me.

33:34.299 --> 33:35.215
You again.

33:35.304 --> 33:36.966
Oh. Hi.

33:37.838 --> 33:39.794
Is this your workshop? Yep.

33:41.000 --> 33:42.796
I'm sorry, what are you doing here?

33:43.262 --> 33:44.631
I'm supposed to meet Toby.

33:44.663 --> 33:46.055
I told you he's out of town.

33:46.278 --> 33:47.754
I know, but I just got a text from him,

33:47.755 --> 33:49.530
and then he told me to meet
him here two hours ago.

33:49.565 --> 33:51.548
I don't know what to tell you.

33:51.856 --> 33:52.945
I haven't seen him.

33:56.581 --> 33:58.319
Did you see a blond come through here?

33:58.510 --> 34:00.516
Nobody's come through here
in the last few hours.

34:00.831 --> 34:03.024
I just saw her. She was wearing a red coat.

34:05.723 --> 34:09.149
Look, no Toby, no girl in a red coat,

34:09.417 --> 34:11.983
and no unicorns, either. Sorry, Emily.

34:13.370 --> 34:14.632
How do you know my name?

34:15.159 --> 34:16.400
Because you told me earlier.

34:17.438 --> 34:18.724
No, I didn't.

34:23.344 --> 34:24.598
I gotta get back to work.

34:31.408 --> 34:32.384
I don't understand.

34:32.385 --> 34:34.638
I hit that black box like a hundred times,

34:34.639 --> 34:35.937
and it didn't even crack.

34:35.938 --> 34:38.080
The video just kept playing over and over.

34:38.081 --> 34:39.177
I don't think that it really matters,

34:39.178 --> 34:39.983
because whoever put that

34:39.984 --> 34:42.286
car in your garage has
probably made copies.

34:42.600 --> 34:46.197
Well, it has to be "A." Why would
Wilden put his car in there?

34:47.360 --> 34:50.655
Okay, so if "A" did this,
and nobody's seen Wilden,

34:52.139 --> 34:54.774
does that mean that Wilden's
dead and that "A" has his body?

34:57.555 --> 34:58.572
I don't know.

35:02.626 --> 35:04.303
I think that maybe you
should tell your mom.

35:04.736 --> 35:07.378
What?! She can handle a
lot more than you think.

35:07.379 --> 35:09.633
Aria, our moms are totally different.

35:09.784 --> 35:11.904
Mine hit the accelerator, remember?

35:12.648 --> 35:13.751
And besides, I don't want to

35:13.752 --> 35:15.665
involve her until we know
what we're dealing with.

35:15.666 --> 35:17.583
She already is involved, Hanna!

35:17.745 --> 35:20.411
She is on that video, and it
really doesn't look good for her.

35:20.412 --> 35:22.568
Well, if "A" drove it here,
who knows what's next?

35:22.751 --> 35:24.291
The cops could be on their way.

35:24.852 --> 35:27.152
You know what, just get in your car.
Follow me.

35:28.754 --> 35:29.822
Where are we going?

36:38.006 --> 36:39.639
I really don't think this is a good idea.

36:39.694 --> 36:41.230
Just keep pushing.

36:41.692 --> 36:43.221
There's gotta be a better solution!

36:43.222 --> 36:44.362
Well, there isn't!

36:49.256 --> 36:50.557
I'm serious, Hanna.

36:50.616 --> 36:53.173
We really, really need to rethink this.

37:09.812 --> 37:10.894
Too late.

37:28.408 --> 37:29.777
I thought it would sink faster.

37:30.896 --> 37:31.993
Yeah, me too.

37:35.744 --> 37:37.593
Well, what if it just
stays there like that?

37:38.150 --> 37:39.233
It'll sink.

37:43.332 --> 37:44.670
They're gonna be looking for his car.

37:45.503 --> 37:46.555
I know.

37:47.784 --> 37:50.181
Look, if they find it and
they trace it back to us,

37:50.182 --> 37:51.574
we are totally screwed.

37:52.479 --> 37:53.438
Yep.

38:04.604 --> 38:05.976
Told you it would sink.

38:37.949 --> 38:39.982
Where have you been? I've been
calling you for the last hour.

38:40.405 --> 38:43.158
Sorry. I had to help
Aria out with something.

38:44.873 --> 38:45.881
Have you eaten?

38:49.310 --> 38:50.391
Are you all right?

38:50.788 --> 38:52.774
Yeah. Are you?

38:53.262 --> 38:54.365
Uh, no.

38:56.481 --> 38:59.547
But I'm... Getting there.

39:00.534 --> 39:01.687
What does that mean?

39:03.781 --> 39:06.078
I think I saw Detective Wilden today.

39:06.733 --> 39:07.847
What? Where?

39:08.086 --> 39:09.085
In town.

39:10.047 --> 39:11.700
But I wasn't sure, so...

39:15.012 --> 39:18.774
I drove by the accident on my way home.

39:19.840 --> 39:23.685
Guess what? His car was gone.

39:25.018 --> 39:26.692
Of course, I panicked at first,

39:27.556 --> 39:29.078
but then it occurred to me...

39:30.742 --> 39:34.129
if he had been... really injured,

39:35.375 --> 39:37.158
we would have heard about it by now, right?

39:39.254 --> 39:40.750
And if he was gonna press charges,

39:40.751 --> 39:42.435
we would have heard about it by now.

39:44.632 --> 39:46.195
Uh, so that means...?

39:48.016 --> 39:50.259
Maybe I didn't hit him...

39:51.943 --> 39:54.264
As hard as I thought, and maybe...

39:55.126 --> 39:58.463
Maybe he woke up and realized
he was in the wrong.

40:00.881 --> 40:02.761
And maybe this whole
thing is just gonna....

40:04.265 --> 40:05.405
Go away.

40:11.048 --> 40:11.944
Yeah.

40:11.945 --> 40:13.302
Uh, I'm gonna go to sleep.

40:15.556 --> 40:16.627
I'll see you in the morning.

40:29.476 --> 40:30.716
You can also put...

40:31.460 --> 40:33.364
It's almost like the
accident didn't happen.

40:34.839 --> 40:36.069
He's doing just fine.

40:37.430 --> 40:40.597
- That's good to hear. 
- Do you want to come over?

40:40.598 --> 40:42.319
We're about to build a castle.

40:42.840 --> 40:44.676
I'd love to, but, um...

40:45.825 --> 40:47.943
I'm... I'm helping my
mom paint her kitchen,

40:47.944 --> 40:50.704
so I'll call you later, okay?

40:51.212 --> 40:52.259
All right.

40:53.409 --> 40:54.475
I love you.

40:55.867 --> 40:57.092
I love you too.

41:08.154 --> 41:10.291
Man on radio: No name? Yep. Jane Doe.

41:10.623 --> 41:13.554
No I.D., no cell phone, no keys, nothing.

41:14.008 --> 41:16.889
Who found her? A hiker. About an hour ago.

41:16.890 --> 41:20.381
Said he saw her wandering around
looking lost and confused.

41:21.165 --> 41:22.429
I'm bringing her in.

41:23.393 --> 41:25.616
Better put in a request
for a psych evaluation.

41:25.617 --> 41:26.781
Roger that.

41:36.613 --> 41:39.502
Wait. You dumped his car in a lake?
I panicked.

41:39.503 --> 41:41.482
You're supposed to stop her from
doing stupid things like this,

41:41.483 --> 41:43.286
not help. I tried!

41:43.466 --> 41:45.890
I didn't know if it was Wilden
or "A" messing with us,

41:45.891 --> 41:47.688
so I just... I had to get rid of it.

41:48.051 --> 41:49.302
Well, my money's on "A."

41:49.601 --> 41:52.032
Or Wilden could still be alive
and part of the "A" team.

41:54.036 --> 41:55.616
Okay, so what does this mean?

41:56.278 --> 41:57.525
Is Toby dead?

41:59.068 --> 42:01.482
Did I do this? Is this my fault?

42:02.997 --> 42:05.133
Don't go there. All right?

42:05.134 --> 42:07.145
Because we don't even know if this is true.

42:07.224 --> 42:08.437
We do know that Toby was

42:08.438 --> 42:10.262
wearing a black hoodie
in Spencer's kitchen.

42:10.263 --> 42:11.206
So?

42:12.076 --> 42:14.051
So either "A" could have killed him

42:14.052 --> 42:15.590
because she knew he was gonna help us...

42:15.591 --> 42:17.094
maybe he never was gonna help us...

42:17.868 --> 42:20.740
And for some reason he just wants
us to think that he's dead.

42:22.384 --> 42:24.223
Either way, Spencer needs
to know about this.

42:24.374 --> 42:25.564
Where is Spencer?
