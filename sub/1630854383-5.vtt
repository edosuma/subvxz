continued the Mega Leg</i>

00:05.482 --> 00:06.655
<i>in Florence, Italy.</i>

00:06.758 --> 00:08.206
Double the Roadblocks,

00:08.310 --> 00:10.068
double the Detours,
double the pain.

00:11.344 --> 00:12.965
<i>The Roadblock pushed Dom</i>

00:13.068 --> 00:14.172
<i>to her breaking point...</i>

00:14.275 --> 00:16.068
Why is this so hard?

00:16.172 --> 00:18.310
<i>...and gave Sharik
second thoughts.</i>

00:18.413 --> 00:20.344
Got the clue, but at what cost?

00:20.448 --> 00:22.000
<i>A showdown for first place</i>

00:22.103 --> 00:25.137
<i>between Marcus and Michael
and Emily and Molly</i>

00:25.241 --> 00:27.551
<i>ended in a victory
for the long-lost twins.</i>

00:27.655 --> 00:28.931
You are team number one.

00:30.793 --> 00:32.793
<i>On the mat,
Sharik made a decision.</i>

00:32.896 --> 00:34.068
Do you want to keep racing?

00:34.172 --> 00:35.517
- You good?
- I'll do it for you.

00:35.620 --> 00:37.448
Strictly.

00:37.551 --> 00:40.482
<i>While Rich and Dom
bid a tearful goodbye.</i>

00:40.586 --> 00:42.034
You are the last team to arrive

00:42.137 --> 00:43.689
and you have been
eliminated from the race.

00:43.793 --> 00:46.413
But there's a lot
to be proud of as well.

00:46.517 --> 00:49.517
I'm thankful to have
someone like Richard, who...

00:49.620 --> 00:52.068
who believes in me so much.

00:55.517 --> 00:57.206
- Morning, everyone.
- Good morning!

00:57.310 --> 00:58.793
So I did say to you guys

00:58.896 --> 01:01.172
that this <i>Amazing Race</i>
would have a lot of firsts.

01:01.275 --> 01:03.000
- Yes.
- Oh, my God.

01:03.103 --> 01:06.310
You are going to a country that
we have never been to before

01:06.413 --> 01:09.103
on the race.

01:09.206 --> 01:12.758
You're going
to the Kingdom of Jordan.

01:15.310 --> 01:17.793
All aboard.
Let's go, let's go.

01:18.896 --> 01:22.689
<i>All teams will now fly
across the Mediterranean Sea</i>

01:22.793 --> 01:24.931
<i>to the Hashemite Kingdom
of Jordan,</i>

01:25.034 --> 01:26.413
<i>an ancient country</i>

01:26.517 --> 01:30.137
<i>with more than 100,000
archeological sites.</i>

01:30.241 --> 01:32.275
<i>With less than three days
of rain a year,</i>

01:32.379 --> 01:34.448
<i>more than 80% of Jordan</i>

01:34.551 --> 01:38.482
<i>is covered in sand,

01:38.586 --> 01:40.275
Wow.

01:40.379 --> 01:43.034
<i>Teams are now boarding
this iconic steam train</i>

01:43.137 --> 01:45.172
<i>that dates back
to the Ottoman Empire.</i>

01:45.275 --> 01:47.206
This is so cool.

01:50.517 --> 01:53.482
<i>We're in the Kingdom of Jordan.</i>

01:58.275 --> 01:59.172
Yes!

02:18.724 --> 02:20.620
Wow, this is gorgeous.

02:22.379 --> 02:24.689
- Look at this.
- This is
absolutely beautiful.

02:28.896 --> 02:30.206
Oh, we're rolling now.

02:35.827 --> 02:37.206
Oh, what's-what's over there?

02:37.310 --> 02:39.965
<i>After beginning their journey</i>

02:40.068 --> 02:42.103
<i>with a relaxing
train ride, teams</i>

02:42.206 --> 02:45.413
have no idea
what they will encounter next.

02:47.103 --> 02:48.206
What?!

02:48.310 --> 02:49.137
Oh, my God!

02:49.241 --> 02:50.448
Wow.

02:52.103 --> 02:54.310
Oh, my gosh!

02:54.413 --> 02:57.068
Is that real
or are we seeing things?

02:58.413 --> 03:01.137
- Wait, that can't be real.
- Are you kidding?

03:03.448 --> 03:05.482
<i>Out of nowhere,
there's horses and camels</i>

03:05.586 --> 03:08.310
<i>and people on horseback swinging
swords, and they're coming</i>

03:08.413 --> 03:10.241
<i>right at us. It was
actually pretty beautiful.</i>

03:10.344 --> 03:12.344
<i>Looked just like a scene
out of a movie.</i>

03:15.482 --> 03:17.517
- Talk about <i>Lawrence of Arabia.</i>
- Oh, <i>Lawrence of Arabia.</i>

03:20.655 --> 03:22.758
This is crazy!

03:30.275 --> 03:32.551
<i>- Wow.
- That is amazing.</i>

03:32.655 --> 03:34.793
<i>Oh, that's so cool.</i>

03:34.896 --> 03:37.000
<i>That really
set the tone for this leg.</i>

03:37.103 --> 03:39.931
<i>This is gonna be something
out of a movie.</i>

03:41.448 --> 03:43.000
We're in a movie.

03:53.275 --> 03:56.137
It's your lucky day.

03:56.241 --> 03:58.689
- Yay! Thank you.
- Thank you. Thank you.
- This is your clue.

03:58.793 --> 03:59.862
Thank you.

03:59.965 --> 04:01.241
- This is your clue.
- Thank you.

04:01.344 --> 04:03.413
- Welcome to Jordan.
- Thank you. Thank you.

04:03.517 --> 04:05.344
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

04:05.448 --> 04:07.275
Thank you.

04:07.379 --> 04:08.931
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

04:09.034 --> 04:10.241
Good luck.

04:10.344 --> 04:12.310

05:06.310 --> 05:07.310
We're gonna keep 'em close.

05:09.379 --> 05:12.482
<i>We came up with
an acronym before the race.</i>

05:12.586 --> 05:16.068
<i>It's called CAR.
The C stands for complacent.</i>

05:16.172 --> 05:18.310
<i>Like, we don't-we don't
want to get complacent, ever.</i>

05:18.413 --> 05:19.896
Uh, A is for adversity,

05:20.000 --> 05:21.275
to obviously
push through adversity.

05:21.379 --> 05:23.206
And then, uh,
R is for resilience.

05:23.310 --> 05:25.482
So when we do make mistakes,
try and forget that

05:25.586 --> 05:27.103
and then
just keep moving forward.

05:27.206 --> 05:29.448
<i>There are no
non-elimination legs,</i>

05:29.551 --> 05:31.517

05:31.620 --> 05:33.344
<i>And because we'â€™re military,</i>

05:33.448 --> 05:36.827
we review the leg, right?
From start to finish.

05:36.931 --> 05:38.275
Uh, what happened?

05:38.379 --> 05:39.827
We'll learn from those
mistakes and move forward.

- I don't know
what we're doing today.
- I'm so pumped.

05:45.931 --> 05:47.620
Whatever it is,
it's gonna be so fun.

05:48.689 --> 05:51.586
We are driving
deep into the desert.

05:51.689 --> 05:54.034
<i>- We are really out here.
- Yeah.</i>

05:57.793 --> 05:59.103
I see it.

05:59.206 --> 06:00.620
You good?

06:01.758 --> 06:03.517
- Ouch.
- You okay?

06:03.620 --> 06:05.517
No, I got something
going on with my thigh.

06:05.620 --> 06:07.172
- Oh, no.
- This is not good.

06:07.275 --> 06:08.758
As soon as we started
running in the sand today,

06:08.862 --> 06:11.413
<i>I had a shooting pain
run up the top of my thigh.</i>

06:11.517 --> 06:14.965
<i>So, running is
a little bit difficult for me.</i>

look familiar to you,

06:25.586 --> 06:28.724

seen them up on the big screen

<i>Transformers</i> and futuristic

06:49.689 --> 06:53.965

they'll have their clue.

Marcus will do it.

- I will.
- Okay.

Oh, man.

07:36.379 --> 07:39.034
I have not used
a metal detector before.

07:39.137 --> 07:41.655
I must have pulled
a muscle in my thigh.

07:42.827 --> 07:44.620
I can't...
I just, like, can't run.

07:44.724 --> 07:46.137
- Really?
- It's, like, right here.

07:46.241 --> 07:48.448
I've never injured
anything up here before.

- Yes! Oh, okay.

After driving an hour and a half

08:06.655 --> 08:10.000

it's no wonder that this
spectacular archeological site

08:27.000 --> 08:30.068
was named one of the new
Seven Wonders of the World.

08:30.172 --> 08:33.275
- All right,
let's get after it.
- Marcus found something.

08:33.379 --> 08:35.068
Didn't see what he did.

08:35.172 --> 08:37.344
I should have been watching him.

08:41.034 --> 08:42.931

Who wants to be our guy?

08:55.517 --> 08:56.413
Ow.

08:56.517 --> 08:58.551
Starting out hot.

09:04.793 --> 09:07.965
We're excited!

We are departing

09:19.137 --> 09:20.551
Feels good to be back
in the middle.

09:20.655 --> 09:22.068
Just got to stay consistent.

09:23.103 --> 09:24.620
<i>I was telling Michelle,
we're not a middle-</i>

09:24.724 --> 09:26.517
of-the-pack team.
That's not who we are.

09:26.620 --> 09:27.827
And I told her last night, like,

09:27.931 --> 09:30.172
"I'm done being
in the middle of pack."

09:30.275 --> 09:32.103
Like, let's push it.
Let's push forward this today,

09:32.206 --> 09:33.275
our first leg.

09:33.379 --> 09:35.206
Started off in tenth place,
and, uh,

09:35.310 --> 09:37.172
<i>ever since then, we've improved.</i>

09:37.275 --> 09:39.689
Last night, we were
dreaming about

09:39.793 --> 09:42.448
- how we were gonna run up to
the mat, what we were gonna do.
- Yeah.

09:42.551 --> 09:44.275
We were envisioning it.

09:44.379 --> 09:46.310
<i>We've been
getting along so well.</i>

09:46.413 --> 09:48.379

Love you, too.

10:00.965 --> 10:02.482
We're ready, though.
We're ready to do this.

10:02.586 --> 10:04.172
Let's go, baby.

10:06.275 --> 10:08.586
<i>Oh, God. This is no joke.</i>

10:08.689 --> 10:12.103

- Me.
- I'll do it.

10:19.034 --> 10:20.103
- Yeah.
- I'll do it.

10:20.206 --> 10:21.172
You got this.

10:22.586 --> 10:23.896
Gonna switch arms.

10:26.620 --> 10:28.620
There you go.

10:34.517 --> 10:35.827
Yeah, Molly.

10:37.379 --> 10:38.275
Hello.

10:38.379 --> 10:40.689
I believe this says "Petra."

10:40.793 --> 10:42.551
Yes. Go.

10:42.655 --> 10:44.034
That was gonna be, uh...

10:44.137 --> 10:46.310
I feel like
I couldn't find it or something.

10:47.517 --> 10:48.551
Professor.

10:48.655 --> 10:51.103
Find a piece of metal.

10:51.206 --> 10:53.241
Every second counts, girl.

10:53.344 --> 10:55.862
Uh, I'm-a work this way.

10:55.965 --> 10:57.655
Got to go slow.

10:57.758 --> 10:59.862
I noticed it was a circle,
pretty much.

10:59.965 --> 11:02.517
<i>And I told myself, "All right,
I'm gonna do an outer circle,</i>

11:02.620 --> 11:04.206
<i>and then come back in.
Go nice and slow."</i>

11:04.310 --> 11:06.793
<i>So that's what I did.
And a few times...</i>

11:07.931 --> 11:09.448
...I heard a beep.

11:09.551 --> 11:10.620
And I just started digging.

11:12.310 --> 11:14.310
My husband
is shoveling right now.

11:14.413 --> 11:17.137
This is hot,
watching Roadblocks.

11:17.241 --> 11:20.620
I'm trying to see how deep
the other teams dug.

11:20.724 --> 11:22.137
And I don't think
it's that deep.

11:22.241 --> 11:24.034
I'm stressed.

11:26.586 --> 11:27.965
Awesome sauce.

11:30.655 --> 11:32.655
Let's go, Q!

11:36.206 --> 11:37.862
- Has he done it?
- Hi, sir.

11:37.965 --> 11:39.137
Go to Petra.

11:39.241 --> 11:40.275
Found what he needed to find.

11:40.379 --> 11:41.793
Let's go, Mattie.

11:41.896 --> 11:43.068
- Nailed it.
- I got it.

11:44.137 --> 11:45.241
Uh-oh.

11:45.344 --> 11:47.517
Look at the girls.
They caught up.

11:47.620 --> 11:51.103
- And the boys
are right ahead of us, so...
- I know. So close.

11:52.103 --> 11:53.793
I didn't even think that
we had an opportunity

11:53.896 --> 11:55.137
to come in first.

11:55.241 --> 11:56.793
Oh, my gosh.

11:56.896 --> 11:58.413
- I mean,
the boys are right there.
- Wow.

11:59.931 --> 12:01.724
It's ringing, though.

12:03.793 --> 12:08.000
Oh, God, it feels like Luis
is beeping every five seconds.

12:08.103 --> 12:11.689
Which, I guess, isn't good,
as long as he hasn't found one.

12:11.793 --> 12:15.068
I have a-a... a louder
than normal reading here,

12:15.172 --> 12:16.758
so I'm gonna try,
I'm gonna try to...

12:18.310 --> 12:19.862
I found something.

12:22.068 --> 12:23.758
Let's go. Good, let's go.

12:23.862 --> 12:24.965
Let's go, baby.

12:25.068 --> 12:27.413
- What?!
- Crap. Aw, man.

12:27.517 --> 12:29.379
No.

12:32.137 --> 12:33.206
Go to Petra.

12:33.310 --> 12:34.344
Petra. Got it.

12:34.448 --> 12:36.379
There they are. Let's go.

12:36.482 --> 12:38.758
Did I miss something?

12:39.551 --> 12:41.172
Just a slow game.

12:41.275 --> 12:43.827
It's more of a patience
challenge than anything else.

12:43.931 --> 12:46.482
And she can
get a little impatient.

12:46.586 --> 12:48.379
15-minute head start
on that third group,

12:48.482 --> 12:50.000
so I feel it ticking away.

12:54.137 --> 12:55.034
Go, go, go, go, go.

12:55.137 --> 12:56.655
"Route Info."

12:56.758 --> 12:58.896
"Welcome to the Wadi Rum Desert
in the Kingdom of Jordan."

12:59.000 --> 13:00.068
- Let's go.
- Okay. I'll hold it.

13:01.241 --> 13:02.724
- Awesome. Let's go.
- Let's go.

13:02.827 --> 13:03.724
All right.

13:03.827 --> 13:04.862
Let's go.

13:04.965 --> 13:06.275
- We're ready. First out.
- Let's go.

13:06.379 --> 13:09.103
Yeah. Yes, sir.
That's what I'm talking about.

13:09.206 --> 13:11.310
Go!

13:11.413 --> 13:12.758
- Step on it!
- Yeah!

13:12.862 --> 13:13.758
Get in front!

13:13.862 --> 13:14.793
Man, we're excited.

13:14.896 --> 13:17.137
- All-terrain.
- Wow. Wow.

13:17.241 --> 13:18.724
How cool.

13:20.620 --> 13:21.896
<i>We're taking it
one leg at a time.</i>

13:22.000 --> 13:23.517
When we get ahead of ourselves,

13:23.620 --> 13:25.448
- you know, we make mistakes,
we get anxious.
- Yeah.

13:25.551 --> 13:27.620
<i>And I think we learned
our lesson from the Mega Leg,</i>

13:27.724 --> 13:29.931
<i>- you know, to kind of
take a breath, and...
- Mm-hmm.</i>

13:30.034 --> 13:33.103
<i>- Calm down.
- ...you know, and just enjoy.</i>

13:33.206 --> 13:37.551
<i>Take a moment and enjoy where we
are in this amazing opportunity.</i>

13:37.655 --> 13:40.000
<i>We're always optimistic,
every leg, and I think</i>

13:40.103 --> 13:42.310
being optimistic has really,
really worked out for us.

13:42.413 --> 13:44.379
Anything can happen.
It's anybody's game.

13:46.793 --> 13:48.344
All right, I think we're here.

13:51.206 --> 13:52.586
This is no joke.

13:53.724 --> 13:54.758
Let's do this.

13:54.862 --> 13:56.344
Oh, man.

13:56.448 --> 13:57.448
"Roadblock."

13:57.551 --> 13:59.103
"Roadblock."

13:59.206 --> 14:00.448
"Roadblock."

14:00.551 --> 14:02.172
"Who Wants to Test Their Metal?"
Me.

14:02.275 --> 14:04.862
- You.
-"Who Wants
to Test Their Metal?"

14:04.965 --> 14:06.586
- You.
- Lumumba.

14:09.241 --> 14:12.103
"Make your way up the sand dune
to the geodesic dome."

14:12.206 --> 14:13.172
- Come on.
- Oh, God.

14:13.275 --> 14:15.206
Almost over the hill. Breathe.

14:15.310 --> 14:19.172
<i>Last leg was so exhausting,
and if I was by myself on this,</i>

14:19.275 --> 14:21.103
<i>I absolutely would've been like,
"I am going home,"</i>

14:21.206 --> 14:22.827
<i>but I know my dad was excited,</i>

14:22.931 --> 14:25.793
<i>and I really wanted
to be able to show up for him.</i>

14:25.896 --> 14:27.655
We-we got to finish
what we started.

14:27.758 --> 14:29.344
You got this, Sharik. Breathe.

14:29.448 --> 14:30.620
"Roadblock.

14:30.724 --> 14:32.241
Who Wants to Test Their Metal?"

14:32.344 --> 14:34.275
You do. Let's go.

14:35.586 --> 14:37.586
Other teams
are coming over the hill,

14:37.689 --> 14:40.068
which is definitely stressful,

14:40.172 --> 14:42.172
but there's
not really much you can do...

14:44.034 --> 14:45.758
...uh, to speed it up.

14:45.862 --> 14:47.137
Oh, thank God.

14:52.344 --> 14:54.137
Oh, found it. This is crazy!

14:54.241 --> 14:56.034
- Go to Petra.
- Thank you very much.

14:56.137 --> 14:57.310
- You got it, Derek.
- Thank you.

14:58.931 --> 15:01.310
I'm just glad I got it
before all those other teams.

15:01.413 --> 15:03.068
- You got it, Derek.
- All right.

15:04.310 --> 15:05.517
<i>There's only four crews left,</i>

15:05.620 --> 15:07.482
<i>and if I'm the last one,
then there's</i>

15:07.586 --> 15:08.931
literally one clue left

15:09.034 --> 15:11.206
<i>in the same amount
of surface to cover.</i>

15:11.310 --> 15:12.827
So I wanted to be
the first one out of there,

15:12.931 --> 15:16.379
<i>which is why I was going out
at an all-out sprint.</i>

15:20.137 --> 15:21.206
You got it, Derek.

15:23.689 --> 15:25.655
All right. I love that beep.

15:28.827 --> 15:30.379
Let's go, David. <i>!Â¡CÃ³rrele!</i>

15:31.448 --> 15:33.965
Nice job, Derek.
You got it. You got it.

15:34.068 --> 15:35.517
Bring her back.

15:35.620 --> 15:37.689
- Go to Petra.
- Okay. Go to Petra.

15:37.793 --> 15:40.103
- Nice job!
- Let's get out of here. Go!

15:40.206 --> 15:42.379
Come on.

15:42.482 --> 15:44.758
- How are you?
We're going to Petra.
- Petra.

15:44.862 --> 15:46.068
<i>I think with most things
in life, but especially</i>

15:46.172 --> 15:47.689
the race, is there's
always a trick,

15:47.793 --> 15:50.379
and the faster you can figure
out what that trick is, uh,

15:50.482 --> 15:52.310
the more of an advantage you'll
get against the other teams.

15:52.413 --> 15:56.413
Any opportunity
that we have to, like, outthink

15:56.517 --> 15:58.551
- or out-strategize
another team...
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.

15:58.655 --> 16:00.275
...we're gonna
make the most of it.

16:00.379 --> 16:02.068
<i>We aren't gonna
be the fastest team,</i>

16:02.172 --> 16:04.137
<i>but hopefully we'll be able to</i>

16:04.241 --> 16:07.551
- uh, be the...
- Make up time in,
like, other ways.

16:10.931 --> 16:15.344
I have to search the crash site
for an alien object.

16:15.448 --> 16:17.758
Literally, there's no telling
where this thing could be.

16:25.862 --> 16:28.206
I found an orange can.

16:29.689 --> 16:30.724
Let's see.

16:32.620 --> 16:35.655
They left a can of soda
called Marina.

16:35.758 --> 16:37.103
- No?
- No.

16:39.965 --> 16:41.103
Here we go.

16:45.413 --> 16:47.206
Another beer can.

16:48.448 --> 16:49.827
The aliens like their beverages.

16:49.931 --> 16:52.172
- Another?
- Another can? Oh, my God.

16:52.275 --> 16:53.482
It's a lot harder than it looks.

16:53.586 --> 16:55.620
Man, it's only stone.

16:55.724 --> 16:57.000
We got this.

16:58.034 --> 17:00.620
I'm trying to dig where
there's not a lot of footprints.

17:00.724 --> 17:03.241
<i>I was trying
to observe footsteps--</i>

17:03.344 --> 17:05.344
<i>that the more
footsteps there was,</i>

17:05.448 --> 17:07.000
<i>I would try
and stay away from them.</i>

17:07.103 --> 17:08.827
David! I'm getting frustrated.

17:08.931 --> 17:11.275
He keeps going to the outside
and not coming on the inside.

17:12.344 --> 17:14.482
- Come on, babe.
- Come on.

17:14.586 --> 17:16.413
Dad, come on.

17:16.517 --> 17:18.344
<i>Everyone's
looking in the middle.</i>

17:18.448 --> 17:20.551
<i>There's got to be
an outlier somewhere.</i>

17:20.655 --> 17:22.724
<i>And so I started
looking on the outside.</i>

17:24.172 --> 17:25.931
It has to be,
obviously, in the middle.

17:26.034 --> 17:27.655
- That's what...
- I'm so annoyed,

17:27.758 --> 17:30.724
'cause, like, why is my dad
literally in the corner?

17:30.827 --> 17:34.034
<i>You know, the hardest part
is not being able to help him.</i>

17:34.137 --> 17:35.448
Come on, David.

17:35.551 --> 17:38.137
I was just, like,
"Why is he going

17:38.241 --> 17:41.206
<i>on the outside of the rim?
That does not make sense."</i>

17:41.310 --> 17:43.034
David hasn't even been up here.

17:43.137 --> 17:44.896
Like, he's
just on the outskirts,

17:45.000 --> 17:46.034
and I'm like...

17:47.137 --> 17:48.620
<i>What just, like, irritated me</i>

17:48.724 --> 17:51.620
is that he was still going
back to, like, the same spots

17:51.724 --> 17:53.172
<i>and going over
and over and over.</i>

17:54.241 --> 17:55.827
Why do you keep
going over there, David?

17:55.931 --> 17:58.172
<i>And it clearly was not there.</i>

17:58.275 --> 18:02.586
<i>He found two parts, ran it
over twice, and then was asking,</i>

18:02.689 --> 18:04.448
like, "Are you sure
this is not the piece?"

18:04.551 --> 18:05.655
It's a motor.

18:07.896 --> 18:09.448
How is it not a .... part?

18:09.551 --> 18:10.931
I'm-I'm, like...

18:11.034 --> 18:12.344
Yeah, I'm definitely
trying not to get annoyed...

18:13.379 --> 18:14.379
...but...

18:16.034 --> 18:18.586
So clearly,
so clearly in the middle.

18:19.620 --> 18:22.000
I just would've done this
so much better.

18:28.793 --> 18:31.241
Oh, this is crazy.

18:32.241 --> 18:34.517
<i>Welcome to Petra.</i>

18:34.620 --> 18:36.000
Thank you so much.
You're the best.

18:36.103 --> 18:38.137
We got to, we got to...
Grab that stuff, right?

18:38.241 --> 18:39.862
Come on. Come on.

18:39.965 --> 18:42.758
- Your leg okay?
- My leg's killing me,
but it's okay.

18:42.862 --> 18:44.689
- Thank you.
- Let's go, let's go.

18:44.793 --> 18:45.827
All right, let's go.

18:46.827 --> 18:48.517
Look for the clue box.
Look for the clue box.

18:48.620 --> 18:49.931
Come on, baby.
You got this, baby. Come on.

18:50.034 --> 18:51.586
It's right here, Marcus.
We're right here.

18:51.689 --> 18:52.862
<i>As we were running
through Petra,</i>

18:52.965 --> 18:55.068
it was insane.
Like, it was beautiful.

18:55.172 --> 18:57.034
<i>There were
so many shapes everywhere,</i>

18:57.137 --> 18:58.931
<i>so many rock formations.</i>

18:59.034 --> 19:01.275
Wow, like,
this place is magical.

19:01.379 --> 19:03.206
- We're in Petra!
- Petra!

19:04.482 --> 19:05.965
Wow.

19:06.068 --> 19:07.586
<i>- Oh, my God.
- This is amazing.</i>

19:07.689 --> 19:09.034
<i>Incredible.</i>

19:09.137 --> 19:11.103
<i>- I see the clue.
- Yep.</i>

19:11.206 --> 19:12.206
Get it first, Mike.

19:12.310 --> 19:14.206
I can't believe it.

19:14.310 --> 19:16.310
Oh, my God.

19:16.413 --> 19:18.275
- No. Over here.
- Here, here.

19:18.379 --> 19:19.448
- Go.
- Go.

19:19.551 --> 19:22.620
"Detour.
Camel Caravan or Palace Puzzle?"

19:22.724 --> 19:25.482
Known as ships of the desert,

19:25.586 --> 19:27.793
camels are
the most useful animals

19:27.896 --> 19:29.896
found in this part of the world.

19:31.551 --> 19:33.793
Capable of walking
in the blazing sun

19:33.896 --> 19:37.689
for over a week without water,
these resilient creatures

19:37.793 --> 19:39.379
have been transporting goods

19:39.482 --> 19:43.586
across desolate landscapes like
this for thousands of years.

19:43.689 --> 19:45.172
<i>These hungry camels</i>

19:45.275 --> 19:48.241
<i>have just made a delivery
to this ancient market</i>

19:48.344 --> 19:50.344
<i>and are now resting
for their next long haul.</i>

19:50.448 --> 19:52.517
<i>Teams need to carry
four bags of hay</i>

19:52.620 --> 19:56.172
<i>and provide water from this
cistern to get their next clue.</i>

19:56.275 --> 19:59.448
Time has not been kind
to this archaeological treasure.

19:59.551 --> 20:02.827
Every effort has been
made to preserve what remains.

20:02.931 --> 20:05.827
This Detour requires teams
to piece together some of

20:05.931 --> 20:09.448
<i>Petra's past by completing
this giant-sized slide puzzle</i>

20:09.551 --> 20:12.241
<i>depicting a rendering
of what the Royal Tombs</i>

20:12.344 --> 20:13.862
<i>were believed to look like
when they were</i>

20:13.965 --> 20:18.034
<i>first carved into these cliffs
nearly 2,000 years ago.</i>

20:18.137 --> 20:20.000
- Let's do the puzzle.
- Okay, we're doing the puzzle.

20:20.103 --> 20:22.172
What do you think?
I think we do fuel up.

20:22.275 --> 20:24.068
We just give 'em food and water.
Then we're done.

20:24.172 --> 20:25.862
Let's hurry.
We're going animals.

20:25.965 --> 20:27.517
- Located near the Palace Tomb.
- Okay.

20:27.620 --> 20:29.482
Anybody know
where the Palace Tomb is?

20:29.586 --> 20:31.862
The tomb? This way? <i>
Shukran. Shukran.</i>

20:31.965 --> 20:33.482
There's camels over there, so
it might be over here somewhere.

20:33.586 --> 20:34.965
Oh, excuse me. Sorry.

20:35.068 --> 20:36.000
- We're gonna go with puzzle.
- We're ready for this.

20:36.103 --> 20:37.310
Let's do puzzle.

20:37.413 --> 20:38.896
- Puzzle. Puzzle.
- Puzzle.

20:39.000 --> 20:43.620
Camel Caravan, to me,
sounded like more walking

20:43.724 --> 20:45.931
- in the hot sun.
- Yes.

20:46.034 --> 20:47.793
So I did not want to do that.

20:47.896 --> 20:49.241
All right, we got this.

20:52.482 --> 20:54.310
Yes.

20:54.413 --> 20:55.689
We're good.

20:55.793 --> 20:59.000
It's actually pretty, uh,
cathartic right here.

21:01.413 --> 21:02.620
Dad, come on.

21:02.724 --> 21:04.551
<i>There are literally
only three left,</i>

21:04.655 --> 21:07.586
<i>so it's just much harder for
the last group to find anything.</i>

21:07.689 --> 21:09.551
So that's kind of where
we're at right now.

21:09.655 --> 21:11.413
Dad, let's go. Let's go.

21:14.034 --> 21:15.586
David, go!

21:16.896 --> 21:18.103
I've never
done anything like this--

21:18.206 --> 21:19.827
not even remotely like this.

21:19.931 --> 21:23.241
Metal detector, you just swing
it, and you just keep walking.

21:23.344 --> 21:24.724
You just take note
of where you've been

21:24.827 --> 21:25.758
and just keep walking.

21:25.862 --> 21:27.965
Oh, my God.

21:28.068 --> 21:30.034
I can't look at this.

21:31.344 --> 21:32.379
<i>David, go!</i>

21:35.724 --> 21:37.034
Come on, David.

21:40.551 --> 21:41.724
Yes! There you go, babe.

21:41.827 --> 21:43.551
Let's go. Let's go.

21:47.068 --> 21:48.965
- It says Petra.
- Go to Petra.

21:49.068 --> 21:51.206
Petra. Petra, Petra.
Let's go.

21:51.310 --> 21:52.379
- Bye, y'all.
- Go!

21:53.896 --> 21:55.655
I knew there had
to be one in the middle.

21:55.758 --> 21:56.931
Well, I'm proud of you.

21:57.034 --> 21:58.655
Petra. We're going to Petra.

21:58.758 --> 21:59.793
- Petra.
- Petra.

21:59.896 --> 22:01.310
<i>Let's go.</i>

22:01.413 --> 22:03.482
<i>There's still
a couple teams behind us,</i>

22:03.586 --> 22:06.137
so anytime there's teams
behind you, it's a good thing,

22:06.241 --> 22:07.241
you know?

22:08.310 --> 22:09.689
We got to go.
We got to go. Let's do it.

22:09.793 --> 22:11.000
Let's go.

22:11.103 --> 22:12.896
Definitely something.

22:15.000 --> 22:16.931
All right, babe.

22:17.965 --> 22:20.068
- Petra. Go to Petra.
- Come on. Good job, babe.

22:20.172 --> 22:22.620
Dude, let's go.
Let's go. Let's go.

22:25.241 --> 22:26.172
Chill out. Chill.

22:26.275 --> 22:28.206
You need to chill, for real.

22:28.310 --> 22:30.344
Great. Let's get in here.

22:30.448 --> 22:34.241
<i>- Let's go.
- Linton and Sharik
were, uh, left behind, um,</i>

22:34.344 --> 22:35.862
as the last people searching for

22:35.965 --> 22:37.758
<i>the, uh, the clue
from the UFO crash site.</i>

22:37.862 --> 22:39.103
<i>We're just happy to have</i>

22:39.206 --> 22:41.241
gotten out of there
ahead of another team.

22:41.344 --> 22:43.724
You know, having no
non-elimination rounds

22:43.827 --> 22:45.344
just heightens the intensity.

22:45.448 --> 22:47.137
<i>- The pressure is on.
- Definitely.</i>

22:47.241 --> 22:49.379
No one wants to go home.

22:49.482 --> 22:51.862
We cannot let up.
We can't slack up,

22:51.965 --> 22:53.827
'cause we really cannot afford
any major mistakes right now.

22:53.931 --> 22:55.000
We just can't.

22:58.724 --> 23:00.689
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

23:00.793 --> 23:02.448
Keep moving.

23:10.517 --> 23:11.620
This is amazing.

23:11.724 --> 23:14.137
Ooh, sorry.

23:14.241 --> 23:16.827
All right. "Detour.
Camel Caravan or Palace Puzzle?"

23:16.931 --> 23:19.103
- Palace Puzzle, baby.
- All right.

23:19.206 --> 23:21.137
Let's go. All right.

23:22.137 --> 23:24.034
Are we going the right way?

23:25.448 --> 23:27.448
It said past the shop
and up the stairs.

23:27.551 --> 23:29.344
Main trail.

23:30.379 --> 23:33.275
Do you-- Can you help us
find the Palace Tomb?

23:33.379 --> 23:34.862
- Go up that way?
- We have to go up.

23:34.965 --> 23:37.275
- Do we...
- So we just came...

23:37.379 --> 23:39.206
- It's around...
- Oh, you got to be kidding me.

23:39.310 --> 23:41.586
- Which way is it around?
- All right. Thank you so much.

23:41.689 --> 23:44.172
My leg is not in good shape,
though, I tell you.

23:50.344 --> 23:51.724
Oh, I see it.

23:51.827 --> 23:53.482
- Oh, it's right there. Yeah.
- Left, left. Let's go.

23:58.827 --> 24:00.620
All right, let's do it.

24:00.724 --> 24:02.586
Palace Puzzle.
Is there a sample somewhere?

24:02.689 --> 24:04.310
- Do we have an example
of what it looks like?
- I think it's that.

24:08.896 --> 24:11.413
I think, yeah. I think
the mermaid goes up here, too.

24:11.517 --> 24:13.103
This one,
this is the top piece.

24:13.206 --> 24:14.758
Genius, Claire.

24:14.862 --> 24:16.034
<i>Seeing a slide puzzle
was like...</i>

24:16.137 --> 24:17.655
<i>â™ª Ah!â™ª</i>

24:17.758 --> 24:18.758
So this is gonna be top.

24:18.862 --> 24:20.344
So that actually
has to go first.

24:20.448 --> 24:22.482
<i>I'm an artificial
intelligence engineer, and I'm</i>

24:22.586 --> 24:24.068
basically solving puzzles

24:24.172 --> 24:26.034
<i>- every single day.
- It's smarter than it sounds.</i>

24:26.137 --> 24:27.310
<i>You have a ton of data,</i>

24:27.413 --> 24:28.517
basically, in my job,
and you have to

24:28.620 --> 24:30.862
figure out what's
the pattern to it.

24:30.965 --> 24:34.241
That's not exactly what a slide
puzzle is, but it's similar.

24:34.344 --> 24:36.862
We need to get these two pieces
next to each other.

24:36.965 --> 24:38.379
<i>I know the strategy.</i>

24:38.482 --> 24:41.413
Approach one side and go over
to finish the picture.

24:41.517 --> 24:43.000
- So, okay,
let's solve this one now.
- Yeah.

24:43.103 --> 24:44.724
- Oh, my God, Claire.
You're killing this.
- Um...

24:44.827 --> 24:46.344
This for sure goes up here.

24:46.448 --> 24:48.137
- Are you sure?
- That doesn't
go with that, though.

24:49.068 --> 24:50.206
Beautiful.

24:50.310 --> 24:52.413
- Look, we got this part.
- Yeah.

24:52.517 --> 24:54.931
Okay. This one goes here.
This one goes there.

24:56.586 --> 24:57.931
Perfect.

24:58.034 --> 24:59.655
- Oh, Em, I'm so sorry.
- No, it's all right.

24:59.758 --> 25:01.482
We'll get there.

25:01.586 --> 25:02.827
Right here, Michael.

25:03.931 --> 25:05.137
"There is a finished example

25:05.241 --> 25:06.724
of the proper way
to set up your station."

25:06.827 --> 25:08.068
That's the station right there, Michael.

25:08.172 --> 25:09.448
- This is what we have to make.
- Okay.

25:09.551 --> 25:10.793
We have one station.

25:10.896 --> 25:12.620
We're gonna set it up
with food and water.

25:12.724 --> 25:15.275
Let's get the water first.
"Make your way to the market

25:15.379 --> 25:17.310
and pick up three water jugs."

25:17.413 --> 25:19.000
- Hello. Maybe this one?
- Yeah.

25:19.103 --> 25:20.482
- Okay. Right here.
- Yeah.

25:21.482 --> 25:23.000
And then...

25:23.103 --> 25:24.862
Where's the water at?

25:24.965 --> 25:26.413
"Then follow the signs
to the cistern."

25:26.517 --> 25:28.172
- Oh, cistern.
Right there, in front of us.
- Yeah.

25:28.275 --> 25:29.551
<i>It's really hot.</i>

25:29.655 --> 25:32.137
<i>And I just thought
the Camel Caravan</i>

25:32.241 --> 25:34.551
<i>was gonna be the easier
and faster of the challenges.</i>

25:34.655 --> 25:36.241
<i>Then as we approached
the challenge,</i>

25:36.344 --> 25:37.758
it turned out
to be a physical challenge

25:37.862 --> 25:41.172
<i>where we're carrying
jugs of water</i>

25:41.275 --> 25:43.448
up and down, like,
a piece of the mountain.

25:43.551 --> 25:45.034
We got to fill it up.

25:47.206 --> 25:48.689
Oh, no.

25:48.793 --> 25:49.965
This is taking forever.

25:50.068 --> 25:52.034
We may have chose
the wrong one, Marcus.

25:52.137 --> 25:54.931
<i>We would throw
three jugs of water,</i>

25:55.034 --> 25:56.344
<i>and it was like
it didn't even matter.</i>

25:56.448 --> 25:58.068
Damn, like, we're gonna
be here forever now.

25:58.172 --> 26:00.241
If we chose wrong...

26:00.344 --> 26:02.724
- God.
- This is gonna take forever.

26:02.827 --> 26:04.482
Dad, come on.

26:04.586 --> 26:07.000
No giving up. No giving up.
It's out here somewhere.

26:11.275 --> 26:12.689
Last team here.

26:12.793 --> 26:14.827
It's a little frustrating.
It's, like, context clues.

26:14.931 --> 26:16.965
Every one of the past few people

26:17.068 --> 26:19.551
found it in this general area.

26:19.655 --> 26:20.793
It's out here somewhere.

26:20.896 --> 26:22.241
This is hard.

26:27.620 --> 26:29.103
Let's go, Dad.

26:29.206 --> 26:31.310
It's out here somewhere.

26:31.413 --> 26:34.000
- Can't do anything about it.
- There's only one piece left.

26:34.103 --> 26:36.241
Sure, it's hard to find.

26:36.344 --> 26:39.379
<i>I was the only one left there,
looking for one piece of metal.</i>

26:39.482 --> 26:41.206
<i>It was like looking
for a needle in a haystack.</i>

26:41.310 --> 26:44.241
Sharik, this thing could
be anywhere. It's only one.

26:44.344 --> 26:45.827
Then I realized, okay, well,

26:45.931 --> 26:47.172
<i>everyone found it in the middle.</i>

26:49.344 --> 26:50.931
Oh.

26:51.034 --> 26:53.000
Seems like he hit something.

26:53.103 --> 26:54.689
So I'm really hoping
that it's it.

26:54.793 --> 26:56.413
It's... That's got to be it.

26:56.517 --> 26:57.551
God.

26:59.551 --> 27:01.379
Oh, thank God.

27:02.379 --> 27:03.724
Go to Petra.

27:03.827 --> 27:06.517
- Go to Petra. Thank you.
- Yeah! Yeah!

27:06.620 --> 27:07.655
Good job, Dad.

27:07.758 --> 27:08.931
That was insane.

27:10.103 --> 27:11.413
- Come on, Sharik. Come on.
- Okay.

27:11.517 --> 27:13.034
Hi. We're going to Petra.

27:14.206 --> 27:16.724
- It's not over till
it's over. Remember that.
- Never. Never.

27:19.310 --> 27:20.724
Well, we chose the wrong one.

27:20.827 --> 27:22.379
Want to switch
or stay where we are?

27:22.482 --> 27:23.586
Ah, we're here now.

27:23.689 --> 27:24.827
After the first trip
to the cistern

27:24.931 --> 27:26.862
of filling these jugs of water,

27:26.965 --> 27:29.551
we knew that we-we chose

27:29.655 --> 27:31.172
<i>the wrong Detour.</i>

27:31.275 --> 27:32.793
<i>I was just like,
"Man, we're here now.</i>

27:32.896 --> 27:34.827
<i>Let's just get this done."
Hopefully nobody else can</i>

27:34.931 --> 27:37.206
- pass us doing
the puzzle Detour.
- Yeah.

27:40.689 --> 27:42.206
Perfect.

27:42.310 --> 27:44.172
- This one goes up here? Okay.
- This one goes right here.

27:44.275 --> 27:46.793
I'm done with doing
the hardest Detours.

27:46.896 --> 27:49.896
<i>And today, I told myself,
"No, we could do slide puzzles."</i>

27:50.000 --> 27:51.310
- We love puzzles.
- Let's take it easy.

27:51.413 --> 27:53.034
- Let's go do a simple puzzle.
- Yeah.

27:53.137 --> 27:54.310
And let's get out of here.

27:54.413 --> 27:56.413
This goes right here.
Oh, we got it.

27:56.517 --> 27:57.724
They got it?

27:57.827 --> 27:59.689
- We got it.
- Good job.

27:59.793 --> 28:02.137
- We got it, too. Good job.
- We got it, we got it,
we got it.

28:02.241 --> 28:03.758
- Hey, hey.
- Uh, check, check.

28:03.862 --> 28:05.206
- I'm racing you guys for first.
- Oh, my God. I got chills.

28:05.310 --> 28:07.000
Yes.

28:07.965 --> 28:09.482
Yes!

28:09.586 --> 28:11.000
Dance. Dance.

28:14.965 --> 28:16.206
"Race to the Great Temple

28:16.310 --> 28:18.034
and search for Phil
among the ruins."

28:19.827 --> 28:22.068
Some experts believe that Petra

28:22.172 --> 28:25.310
covers about 100 square miles--

28:25.413 --> 28:29.241
equivalent to the size
of 100 Manhattan Islands.

28:29.344 --> 28:33.241
This is the largest
freestanding building in Petra--

28:33.344 --> 28:35.241
the Great Temple--

28:35.344 --> 28:37.724
among the most impressive
Pit Stops

28:37.827 --> 28:39.482
in <i>Amazing Race</i> history.

28:39.586 --> 28:41.620
The last team
to check in here...

28:43.310 --> 28:44.689
<i>...will be eliminated.</i>

28:44.793 --> 28:46.206
Let's go. Let's go.

28:47.206 --> 28:48.931
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

28:49.034 --> 28:50.310
See-see where it goes.

28:51.310 --> 28:52.655
- Thank you. Thank you. Okay.
- Thank you. Thank you.

28:52.758 --> 28:54.068
Good job, guys.

28:55.068 --> 28:56.206
Come on, Mattie.

28:56.310 --> 28:57.517
Let's go.

28:57.620 --> 28:59.137
What did the guide say,
direction-wise?

28:59.241 --> 29:00.586
It just said
go through the main entrance.

29:00.689 --> 29:02.758
- Thank you so much.
- Let's go.

29:03.931 --> 29:05.896
Let's go, David. Come on.

29:06.000 --> 29:07.241
You feeling good about puzzle?

29:07.344 --> 29:09.137
- Yeah. We trained for this.
- Okay.

29:10.931 --> 29:13.689
Abby loves puzzles.
Uh, she's really good at 'em.

29:13.793 --> 29:16.965
The challenge is just figuring
out kind of where they go,

29:17.068 --> 29:19.206
so that you
can follow the algorithm.

29:20.275 --> 29:22.241
Let's just start moving
some things around.

29:22.344 --> 29:24.172
- Come on, guys.
Let's go.
- Hey.

29:24.275 --> 29:26.034
Did they do that,
like, so fast?

29:26.137 --> 29:28.275
Come on, Mattie. Clue box.

29:28.379 --> 29:29.448
Right here. Right here.

29:29.551 --> 29:31.448
"Detour.
Camel Caravan or Palace Puzzle?"

29:31.551 --> 29:33.413
We choose Palace Puzzle.

29:33.517 --> 29:35.137
"Solve an archaeological
slide puzzle

29:35.241 --> 29:36.931
depicting the Palace Tomb
to receive your next clue."

29:37.034 --> 29:39.241
- We're gonna do that one.
Let's go.
- Okay.

29:39.344 --> 29:42.034
So it says, "To find the hay,
make your way to the cave

29:42.137 --> 29:43.896
located just to the right
of the cistern."

29:44.896 --> 29:46.344
Uh, over here.

29:46.448 --> 29:47.793
It says the food's over here.

29:47.896 --> 29:48.931
Where?

29:50.172 --> 29:52.896
- God.
- Four bags, looks like.

29:53.000 --> 29:54.448
- Four.
- Yeah.

29:54.551 --> 29:56.275
- Okay.
- Oh, this is awful.

29:56.379 --> 29:59.172
So, we'll bring it
back to our station.

30:01.724 --> 30:03.172
I see people. Come on.

30:03.275 --> 30:05.655
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

30:05.758 --> 30:07.379
Let's do this.

30:09.034 --> 30:10.620
We chose the puzzle piece

30:10.724 --> 30:13.000
because thought it'd be easier
to pick our brains instead of

30:13.103 --> 30:14.689
running around getting
more exhausted, physically.

30:14.793 --> 30:15.896
Ready to rock and roll.
Thank you.

30:16.000 --> 30:17.482
Okay.

30:17.586 --> 30:19.068
<i>This race has really, really</i>

30:19.172 --> 30:20.689
- helped our marriage.
It really has.
- Yeah, yeah.

30:20.793 --> 30:22.827
You're doing amazing, babe.

30:22.931 --> 30:24.689
I never knew
you had this in you.

30:24.793 --> 30:26.551
<i>It's helping us to see
each other's strengths.</i>

30:26.655 --> 30:28.931
- Yeah.
- Um, to see how we respond
to our own weaknesses

30:29.034 --> 30:30.724
<i>and the other person's weakness.</i>

30:30.827 --> 30:32.206
- Yeah, yeah.
- It's amazing.

30:32.310 --> 30:34.137
Look at you, running through
the cliffs of Jordan.

30:34.241 --> 30:35.620
This is beautiful.

30:36.620 --> 30:38.137
<i>Oh, man.</i>

30:42.275 --> 30:43.827
Please, please, please.

30:43.931 --> 30:45.103
Thank you.

30:45.206 --> 30:46.517
- Huh?
- The...

30:46.620 --> 30:47.758
the camel.

30:51.517 --> 30:52.758
Come on, Marcus.

30:54.758 --> 30:55.793
This way, Marcus.

30:57.965 --> 30:59.965
You led a caravan... Oh, yeah.

31:00.068 --> 31:01.137
Eat up.

31:10.827 --> 31:12.862
Thank you.
Come on. We got it. We good.

31:12.965 --> 31:14.724
- Yay. Thank you so much.
- Yeah, there we go.

31:14.827 --> 31:16.620
Great job, Abby. Great work.

31:16.724 --> 31:18.689
Do I... Yeah?

31:20.793 --> 31:23.413
- All right. Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

31:23.517 --> 31:25.310
Let's go. Let's go.

31:26.379 --> 31:28.793
- Good job, Claire.
You killed it this leg. Come on.
- Yeah, good job.

31:28.896 --> 31:31.103
- That was all you
on the slide puzzle.
- Thank you.

31:31.206 --> 31:32.862
It's our turn, baby.
It's our turn.

31:32.965 --> 31:34.896
That's right!

31:35.000 --> 31:36.689
- We're in a footrace
right now for first.
- I know.

31:36.793 --> 31:38.241
You got it, baby.

31:38.344 --> 31:40.517
- You got it, baby.
- Just go as hard as you can.

31:40.620 --> 31:41.551
I am.

31:41.655 --> 31:43.896
Let's go. Let's go.

31:44.000 --> 31:45.862
You got this, Claire.

31:45.965 --> 31:46.862
Oh, my God.

31:46.965 --> 31:49.586
Yeah!

31:49.689 --> 31:51.344
Yes! Yes!

31:53.517 --> 31:55.206
- Ow!
- Oh!

31:55.310 --> 31:56.620
Oh, help Claire out.

31:56.724 --> 31:58.793
I'm good. I'm okay.

31:58.896 --> 32:02.034
Wow, that was a footrace.
You okay?

32:02.137 --> 32:04.034
- Got a bit
of blood there, Claire.
- I know.

32:04.137 --> 32:05.310
I'm okay.

32:05.413 --> 32:07.103
Luis and Michelle,
I am pleased to tell you

32:07.206 --> 32:09.241
- that you are team number one.
- Yes!

32:10.862 --> 32:13.448
- And I have
some great news for you.
- We did it!

32:13.551 --> 32:16.000
I told you!
As the winners
of this leg of the race,

32:16.103 --> 32:18.068
you have won

32:18.172 --> 32:20.344
$5,000...

32:20.448 --> 32:22.793
which you can enjoy
after the race.

32:22.896 --> 32:24.965
Oh, my God.

32:25.068 --> 32:27.965
Phil, this is so emotional
for me, because last night,

32:28.068 --> 32:31.137
Luis was telling me,
"Imagine first place.

32:31.241 --> 32:33.448
Imagine Phil's face.
Like, what are we gonna win?"

32:33.551 --> 32:35.517
We're imagining everything.

32:35.620 --> 32:38.000
And then to be here
and run through that hot desert.

32:38.103 --> 32:40.172
I thought I was gonna give up,
and he didn't let me give up.

32:40.275 --> 32:42.379
So this feels good.

32:42.482 --> 32:44.965
Not like you guys didn't
give 'em a run for their money.

32:45.068 --> 32:47.241
I mean, literally,
a run for the money.

32:47.344 --> 32:49.034
We tried to run for the money.
We fell.

32:49.137 --> 32:50.137
We tried to fall for the money.

32:52.103 --> 32:55.379
"Camel Caravan
or Palace Puzzle?"

32:55.482 --> 32:58.379
- Camel can take a walk...
- Let's do the Camel Caravan.

32:58.482 --> 33:00.068
We're gonna do
the Camel Caravan.

33:00.172 --> 33:02.241
I know this-this looks right.

33:02.344 --> 33:03.551
This guy for sure
has to be on this side,

33:03.655 --> 33:05.965
because his legs
have to line up with this.

33:06.068 --> 33:08.000
Push that up. Push this over.

33:09.931 --> 33:12.310
And then start moving these.

33:12.413 --> 33:14.068
Get that over there. Yeah.

33:15.241 --> 33:16.931
Wait. Isn't that right?

33:17.034 --> 33:18.344
No, no, this goes with this guy.

33:18.448 --> 33:20.379
How do you...

33:25.586 --> 33:27.103
This goes on top of this.

33:27.206 --> 33:29.275
- Gosh, okay.
How would you do this?
- Okay.

33:30.620 --> 33:32.275
I see camels over here.

33:32.379 --> 33:33.689
This is for camels?

33:33.793 --> 33:35.034
- That's a display...
- Okay.

33:35.137 --> 33:37.068
One, two, three, four.

33:37.172 --> 33:39.000
And then we have that.
That's gonna be a lot of water.

33:40.034 --> 33:41.379
Let's do the puzzle, babe.

33:41.482 --> 33:42.724
- All right, let's do the puzzle.
- Let's go do the puzzle.

33:42.827 --> 33:44.241
Oh, those must be the puzzles, baby.

33:44.344 --> 33:45.655
Okay. Oh,
they're still doing it.

33:45.758 --> 33:47.413
- Uh, they're over there.
- All right. Wait for me.

33:47.517 --> 33:48.827
All right.

33:48.931 --> 33:50.034
Come on.

33:50.137 --> 33:52.275
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, hey.

33:52.379 --> 33:53.896
Hello.

33:54.000 --> 33:55.310
We made it.
When we get to the Detour,

33:55.413 --> 33:57.413
and to see two teams

33:57.517 --> 33:59.448
<i>- already, like,
still at the Detour
- Yeah.</i>

33:59.551 --> 34:01.793
<i>when we were
so far behind everybody,</i>

34:01.896 --> 34:03.551
- we were so excited.
- Excited.

34:03.655 --> 34:05.862
Puzzles are your friend, babe.
- All right.

34:05.965 --> 34:07.758
Let's focus on this puzzle
and get the hell out of here.

34:07.862 --> 34:09.413
Yeah, he's right there.

34:13.724 --> 34:15.827
Good job, guys.

34:15.931 --> 34:17.551
- Good job, guys.
- This was
a lot of running.

34:17.655 --> 34:19.103
Good work.

34:19.206 --> 34:21.413
So, Michael and Marcus,
I'm pleased to tell you

34:21.517 --> 34:23.448
that you are team number three. Congratulations.

34:23.551 --> 34:24.896
Thank you.

34:25.000 --> 34:25.965
- A hot one.
- Good job, guys.
- Yes.

34:26.068 --> 34:27.379
Puzzling day?

34:27.482 --> 34:29.620
We should've chose the puzzle.

34:29.724 --> 34:30.896
Yeah, we should have.

34:31.000 --> 34:32.517
- Y'all's thing looked brutal.
- Yeah.

34:32.620 --> 34:35.034
Abby and Will, that would mean
that you are team number four.

34:35.137 --> 34:36.344
Congratulations.
You're right up there.

34:36.448 --> 34:37.965
- Oh.
- Top of the pack.

34:38.068 --> 34:40.241
- Oh, my gosh.
- Oh, look, there's another team.

34:42.103 --> 34:43.655
Good job, guys. Great work.

34:43.758 --> 34:45.655
- Hey, good job, y'all.
- Good job, y'all.

34:45.758 --> 34:47.344
- Oh, man, look at this place.
- I know.

34:47.448 --> 34:48.827
- Isn't it wonderful?
- It's unbelievable.
- It's amazing.

34:48.931 --> 34:50.931
Emily and Molly, I am
pleased to tell you that, uh,

34:51.034 --> 34:52.931
- you are team number five.
- Yes.

34:53.034 --> 34:54.758
All right.

34:54.862 --> 34:56.413
I think I did pretty good

34:56.517 --> 34:59.758
running on my injured leg
through this leg.

34:59.862 --> 35:02.344
<i>Hopefully there's not too much
running in the next leg.</i>

35:02.448 --> 35:03.862
We got to stay in this.

35:05.655 --> 35:07.241
Let's do Palace Puzzle.

35:07.344 --> 35:09.793
"Both Detours are
located near the Palace Tomb."

35:09.896 --> 35:11.655
I'm saying camels.
I think that's easier.

35:11.758 --> 35:13.172
- You think so?
- Yes.

35:13.275 --> 35:15.206
- Let's do Camel Caravan.
- Okay.

35:15.310 --> 35:17.482
Oh, my gosh.

35:19.344 --> 35:21.103
Thank you.

35:24.551 --> 35:26.931
Oh, yeah. Come on, girl.
Come on.

35:27.034 --> 35:29.379
I really feel like...
so this lines up as the edge.

35:29.482 --> 35:30.620
So this is there.

35:30.724 --> 35:32.448
This is,
this is definitely either...

35:32.551 --> 35:35.413
- This is the lower portion.
So this is right here, for sure.
- Okay.

35:35.517 --> 35:38.448
We're just literally guessing.
We're trying to figure out...

35:40.379 --> 35:42.965
...a reference point,
but there is no reference point.

35:43.965 --> 35:45.103
This doesn't make sense.

35:45.206 --> 35:46.896
- This is all right.
- Yeah.

35:47.000 --> 35:48.482
This right here
goes right there.

35:48.586 --> 35:50.310
- All right, cool.
- So l-let's see.

35:50.413 --> 35:51.793
Move this...

35:51.896 --> 35:54.000
Yes, that's right. That's right.
I'm sorry. Keep going.

35:54.103 --> 35:56.620
- All right, all right.
- I see it now. I see it now.

36:01.689 --> 36:02.586
Check, please.

36:02.689 --> 36:05.000
Line and sinker.

36:08.310 --> 36:09.517
- Wait.
- Upside down.

36:12.482 --> 36:13.965
Hold on. Hold on.

36:14.068 --> 36:15.103
Oh, my God.
Are we right behind them?

36:15.206 --> 36:16.448
Yep.

36:16.551 --> 36:17.551
You were smart to pick that one.
Come on, baby.

36:17.655 --> 36:18.793
We got to haul tail.

36:18.896 --> 36:20.655
Three jugs, one white,

36:20.758 --> 36:24.689
one green and one brown.

36:24.793 --> 36:26.275
- Right here.
- Yeah.

36:26.379 --> 36:27.827
- Okay.
- All right.

36:27.931 --> 36:31.137
"Follow the sign to
the cistern filled with water."

36:31.241 --> 36:33.000
- Cistern filled with water.
- This way, Dad. This way.

36:33.103 --> 36:35.620
All right. Cistern.
Oh, here we go.

36:35.724 --> 36:37.448
You found it?

36:37.551 --> 36:39.034
Here we go.

36:40.103 --> 36:41.103
Perfect.

36:43.689 --> 36:45.586
This heat is crazy.

36:45.689 --> 36:47.103
Oh, my God.

36:48.172 --> 36:50.068
Oh, yeah. Come on, girl.
Come on.

36:50.172 --> 36:53.482
Drop your backpacks
in the middle of the mat.

36:53.586 --> 36:55.172
- Talk about a workout.
- Yeah.

36:55.275 --> 36:56.862
The Jordanians don't play.

36:56.965 --> 36:58.310
They do not.

36:58.413 --> 36:59.827
Quinton and Mattie,
I am pleased to tell you

36:59.931 --> 37:02.793
that you are team number six. Congratulations.

37:02.896 --> 37:04.137
- Okay, I'll take it.
- All right. I'll take it.

37:04.241 --> 37:06.137
Right? You should
be very proud of that.

37:09.724 --> 37:11.931
- Okay.
- The closest one, right?

37:12.034 --> 37:14.137
- Fill this up?
- Yeah.

37:19.689 --> 37:21.172
- David.
- Baby, where is it gonna go?

37:21.275 --> 37:22.758
This needs to end with this.

37:22.862 --> 37:24.517
- Are you sure?
Because these also match.
- I am sure.

37:24.620 --> 37:27.413
- No. That matches.
- Okay.

37:29.724 --> 37:30.758
There.

37:31.896 --> 37:33.000
- That's it.
That's it. That's it.
- That's it?

37:33.103 --> 37:34.034
Check.

37:34.137 --> 37:35.275
Backpacks.

37:35.379 --> 37:36.931
No?

37:45.034 --> 37:46.896
- He said no?
- He said no.

37:47.000 --> 37:49.103
It was like a stab in the heart

37:49.206 --> 37:52.275
when the person came up
and gave us a-a thumbs down.

37:53.344 --> 37:54.965
It wa...
That was a tough one to swallow,

37:55.068 --> 37:56.827
- but, no, we got
to finish what we started.
- Mm-hmm.

37:56.931 --> 37:58.620
And, you know,
I grew up in a very competitive

37:58.724 --> 38:00.068
dance atmosphere.

38:00.172 --> 38:02.413
And you don't quit.

38:02.517 --> 38:03.655
But this is right.

38:03.758 --> 38:04.965
But how's this gonna go?

38:05.068 --> 38:06.103
Oh.

38:07.068 --> 38:09.172
- God.
- You got this, Sharik.
You got it.

38:09.275 --> 38:10.931
Slow and steady is fine.

38:18.034 --> 38:19.931
The only way that
I can think of it starting

38:20.034 --> 38:21.724
would be with this,
'cause this all makes sense.

38:21.827 --> 38:23.275
This is all good.

38:23.379 --> 38:26.448
And this is the layer
that would probably go up here.

38:27.482 --> 38:29.586
We essentially have
to put the lower level

38:29.689 --> 38:31.448
that we have on the upper level.

38:31.551 --> 38:33.275
Well, then can we just shift...

38:33.379 --> 38:35.620
- So then we shift.
- Yeah, just shift it this way.

38:35.724 --> 38:37.379
Boom!

38:37.482 --> 38:39.724
Don't play with us.

38:39.827 --> 38:41.137
It's enough to just get here.

38:41.241 --> 38:42.310
You got it, baby.

38:42.413 --> 38:44.275
You got it.

38:46.344 --> 38:47.517
Oh, very nice.

38:47.620 --> 38:49.551
You're still
going to continue racing,

38:49.655 --> 38:51.275
- because you are
team number seven.
- Yeah!

38:51.379 --> 38:54.310
Congratulations.

38:54.413 --> 38:55.482
Let's go!

38:55.586 --> 38:56.793
Lumumba, do you feel
like you've

38:56.896 --> 38:58.517
got it in you as a team

38:58.620 --> 39:00.517
to be able to win this?
Is it possible?

39:00.620 --> 39:01.758
I can't even believe
you're asking me that.

39:01.862 --> 39:03.068
Are you insulted by my question?

39:03.172 --> 39:04.586
- Uh, yes, we are.
- I'm not insulted.

39:04.689 --> 39:06.413
I just-I just feel
like the best is yet to come.

39:06.517 --> 39:07.862
You're about
to see something amazing.

39:07.965 --> 39:10.000
Almost there, Sharik.

39:14.000 --> 39:15.206
- Good? Thank you.
- Good.

39:15.310 --> 39:16.655
All right, now we need the hay.

39:16.758 --> 39:19.068
That's the cave.
Come on. I got you.

39:19.172 --> 39:21.103
I got you.

39:21.206 --> 39:23.034
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

39:23.137 --> 39:25.241
I'm so proud of you.
You're doing it. Hot.

39:25.344 --> 39:27.344
- Sorry, just like,
overheating and...
- You're good.

39:27.448 --> 39:28.344
Come on.

39:28.448 --> 39:29.448
Puppies.

39:29.551 --> 39:30.448
Come. A puppy.

39:31.758 --> 39:33.551
Three bags? Or is it four?

39:33.655 --> 39:36.310
- Three. Trust me.
- Let's take four, just in case.

39:36.413 --> 39:37.655
Sure.

39:37.758 --> 39:39.793
Okay, it's four. You were right.

39:39.896 --> 39:43.034
- This is it. This is it. Check.
- That's it. Check.

39:43.137 --> 39:44.965
Oh, yes!

39:45.068 --> 39:46.172
Oh, thank you.

39:46.275 --> 39:47.896
- Okay, go, go, go, go.
- Okay.

39:48.000 --> 39:49.517
Oh, my God. Let's go.

39:49.620 --> 39:50.689
All right, camel, camel.

39:50.793 --> 39:52.551
Get some water.

39:52.655 --> 39:54.482
- Drinky, drinky.
- Woo-hoo.

39:54.586 --> 39:57.034
Drinky, drinky. Feed the camel.

39:57.137 --> 39:59.310
- Yeah, we got
to feed the camel, camel.
- Oh, my God.

39:59.413 --> 40:00.862
Here you go, camel, camel.

40:01.931 --> 40:04.241
Come on. Drink some of my water.
I-I worked hard.

40:04.344 --> 40:06.379
- Yay. Thank you.
- Thank you.

40:06.482 --> 40:07.655
All right.

40:07.758 --> 40:08.931
- All right.
- All right. Come on.

40:09.034 --> 40:10.413
We can't give up now. Come on.

40:10.517 --> 40:12.206
We just hope we're not last.

40:12.310 --> 40:13.689
- What is it called?
- Excuse me.

40:13.793 --> 40:15.620
The ruins?

40:15.724 --> 40:17.620
- No. Come here, baby. Come on.
- No?

40:17.724 --> 40:19.275
- You sure
we're going the right way?
- Yes, yes, yes.

40:19.379 --> 40:20.655
Okay.

40:20.758 --> 40:22.241
Hi. Do you know
where we can find the ruins?

40:22.344 --> 40:23.896
No?

40:24.000 --> 40:25.413
Excuse me.

40:25.517 --> 40:27.724
Do you guys know where
we can find the Great Temple?

40:27.827 --> 40:29.551
- No. The Great Temple.
- It's the Great Temple.

40:33.344 --> 40:34.896
Let's go.

40:35.000 --> 40:36.517
I need you. Come on.

40:36.620 --> 40:38.310
- Keep going. Keep going.
Keep going.
- I'm coming, baby.

40:40.034 --> 40:41.517
Come on, like you mean it, baby,
come on.

40:47.241 --> 40:48.448
- Wow.
- Oh, my God.

40:49.793 --> 40:51.344
Are you happy
that you came on the race?

40:51.448 --> 40:52.551
Oh, my gosh, it's...

40:52.655 --> 40:53.896
It was a dream come true.

40:54.000 --> 40:55.793
Five legs of the race.
That's a...

40:55.896 --> 40:57.241
- that's a big achievement.
- Yeah.

40:57.344 --> 40:59.758
- It-it is.
- But there are more legs.

40:59.862 --> 41:02.103
Right? And it would be
nice if you could do more.

41:02.206 --> 41:03.931
- It'd be wonderful.
- Phil, please tell us
we're doing more.

41:04.034 --> 41:05.241
- Would you like to do more?
- Yes,
we'd love to do more.

41:05.344 --> 41:07.068
Well, you've earned
the right to do more,

41:07.172 --> 41:09.689
because you are team
number eight. Congratulations.

41:16.448 --> 41:18.000
Good job, Sha-Sha.

41:18.103 --> 41:19.827
- Good job. Good job.
- There you go.

41:19.931 --> 41:21.482
- Hug.
- No.

41:21.586 --> 41:23.448
- No? Come on.
- Hi, Phil.

41:23.551 --> 41:26.000
- No, no, please, it's hot.
- Hi, there.
Drop your bags onto this.

41:26.103 --> 41:28.034
Linton and Sharik,
I am sorry to tell you

41:28.137 --> 41:29.689
that you are
the last team to arrive.

41:29.793 --> 41:31.896
You have been
eliminated from the race.

41:32.000 --> 41:33.965
I know it's been a-a rough leg.

41:34.068 --> 41:35.344
This is absolutely the most

41:35.448 --> 41:37.758
physically demanding
thing I've ever had to do.

41:37.862 --> 41:39.896
And I was a competitive
cheerleader for, like, six years

41:40.000 --> 41:41.896
and played sports
throughout all of high school.

41:42.000 --> 41:44.137
This has definitely
been much more brutal

41:44.241 --> 41:46.586
than all of those
combined, so...

41:46.689 --> 41:47.931
I wasn't as prepared
as I thought.

41:48.034 --> 41:49.793
I think she-she's amazing.

41:49.896 --> 41:51.793
- And I-I... She-she...
I-I love her even more.
- Thanks, Dad.

41:51.896 --> 41:53.482
- Thank you. Thank you.
- Very proud of her.

41:53.586 --> 41:54.758
We finished what we started.

41:54.862 --> 41:56.655
We really appreciated
you being here.

41:56.758 --> 41:58.551
I know you've got
many more adventures together.

41:58.655 --> 42:00.000
- You bet. Yes.
- Yeah, definitely.

42:00.103 --> 42:02.758
This experience
has brought us closer,

42:02.862 --> 42:05.137
<i>even though I didn't even know
we could get any closer.</i>

42:05.241 --> 42:06.793
This is my princess,

42:06.896 --> 42:08.206
<i>and just to experience this
with her</i>

42:08.310 --> 42:09.896
<i>and learn a little bit
more about her</i>

42:10.000 --> 42:11.793
is something that
I'll take with me for life.
