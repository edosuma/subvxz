WEBVTT

00:12.099 --> 00:13.535
Dispatch to 44.

00:14.753 --> 00:16.451
- 44, go ahead.

00:16.538 --> 00:18.670
- Respond to
the 400 block of early road,

00:18.757 --> 00:20.759
report of a crash
involving a motorcycle.

00:21.891 --> 00:23.893
44 copy, on my way.

00:37.341 --> 00:39.822
- When you
experience death like I have,

00:40.866 --> 00:42.607
you see that God's not there.

01:42.058 --> 01:43.103
Tell me, pastor,

01:44.713 --> 01:47.019
why does God let bad things
happen to good people?

01:49.979 --> 01:51.198
Why is God silent?

01:54.157 --> 01:55.811
- Do you really think that God,

01:56.942 --> 01:58.553
the creator of heaven and Earth,

01:58.640 --> 02:00.990
and everything in it is silent?

02:08.693 --> 02:13.002
You really think he's just
ignoring all of us down here?

02:14.046 --> 02:17.398
Maybe he's talking, Jonathan,

02:17.485 --> 02:19.095
and you're just not listening.

02:22.229 --> 02:25.057
- I wonder what you'd say if
you saw the things I've seen.

02:31.325 --> 02:33.240
My dad was my best friend,

02:34.154 --> 02:36.112
and my best memories of
him were on that lake,

02:36.199 --> 02:37.940
doing what we loved.

02:40.377 --> 02:41.552
- Yeah?

02:43.728 --> 02:46.557
You know, I remember one time
we went deep sea fishing,

02:47.863 --> 02:51.083
and I put a bass line
looking for sea bass.

02:51.171 --> 02:53.912
All of a sudden, my
line just took off.

02:53.999 --> 02:55.914
Something big got it.

02:56.001 --> 02:59.962
I finally pull him up to
the top and it was huge,

03:00.049 --> 03:02.443
and the three of us pulled
that thing up over the side,

03:02.530 --> 03:04.793
and got it on the
deck of the boat.

03:04.880 --> 03:07.839
It was 105 pounds.

03:07.926 --> 03:10.233
It was five foot long.

03:10.320 --> 03:11.713
- Five foot?

03:11.800 --> 03:14.324
- So what do you think,
for your next birthday,

03:14.411 --> 03:16.761
if we take you deep sea fishing?

03:18.154 --> 03:19.199
- For real?

03:19.286 --> 03:20.548
- For real.

03:20.635 --> 03:22.637
- Wow, that's pretty cool.

03:23.855 --> 03:24.900
- I can't think of a better way

03:24.987 --> 03:26.423
to celebrate your next birthday

03:26.510 --> 03:28.164
than to take you
deep sea fishing.

03:29.339 --> 03:31.950
- I didn't
realize it then,

03:32.037 --> 03:34.170
but that was my last
good memory of my dad.

03:38.174 --> 03:40.350
I can remember the
day she told us.

03:41.612 --> 03:43.571
As a kid you never
fully understand.

03:45.703 --> 03:46.965
- Daddy's really sick,

03:50.882 --> 03:54.625
and Jesus is going to
take him to heaven soon.

04:08.639 --> 04:13.340
You're going
to be okay, I promise.

04:16.647 --> 04:17.387
I promise.

04:26.178 --> 04:28.180
We are going to be okay.

04:35.275 --> 04:36.319
- Hi, Jonathan.

04:38.190 --> 04:38.974
Come in.

04:40.149 --> 04:40.932
Come in.

04:46.155 --> 04:48.505
You'll be the man
of the house soon.

04:49.767 --> 04:53.249
Mom's gonna need you
to be strong, okay?

04:53.336 --> 04:56.252
- Who's going to take
me fishing in the ocean?

04:56.339 --> 04:57.514
- Sorry, Jonathan.

04:59.690 --> 05:01.736
I won't be able to
take you to the ocean.

05:02.954 --> 05:05.130
It's almost my time, I'm sorry.

05:08.046 --> 05:08.830
No.

05:11.876 --> 05:14.314
- I still regret not
spending more time with him.

05:15.489 --> 05:17.229
I regret not
talking to him more.

05:23.235 --> 05:24.193
Come on.

05:24.280 --> 05:25.325
No, no.

05:29.807 --> 05:30.547
No, no,
no.

05:36.248 --> 05:37.554
- That was the day

05:37.641 --> 05:39.469
I realized God
didn't care about me.

05:40.383 --> 05:42.298
God didn't care about any of us.

05:43.604 --> 05:46.084
Even if he was real, why
wouldn't he listen to a child?

06:11.327 --> 06:12.502
- Sorry, Jonathan.

06:14.591 --> 06:16.550
I won't be able to
take you to the ocean.

06:18.987 --> 06:21.511
You'll be man of the house soon.

06:23.470 --> 06:25.602
Mom's going to need
you to be strong, okay?

06:34.045 --> 06:35.046
- Hey!

06:38.310 --> 06:39.399
Jonathan?

06:39.486 --> 06:41.139
- Why did daddy die?

06:41.226 --> 06:42.184
We prayed for him.

06:43.272 --> 06:44.534
Who's gonna take care of you?

06:44.621 --> 06:48.886
Who's going to take care of me?

06:48.973 --> 06:50.410
- I'm sorry, son.

06:52.412 --> 06:53.804
I'm sorry.

06:53.891 --> 06:56.328
- You're not,
you don't understand.

06:56.416 --> 06:57.504
- Jonathan, wait.

06:57.591 --> 06:58.983
Please, Jonathan.

06:59.984 --> 07:00.768
Jonathan!

07:04.424 --> 07:07.731
- Eight years later, I was
training to become an officer.

07:08.863 --> 07:10.168
- Let's go, Jonathan move it.

07:10.255 --> 07:11.343
Come on.

07:11.431 --> 07:12.301
Come on, get them out of there.

07:12.388 --> 07:13.171
Come on, move it.

07:16.392 --> 07:17.611
Jonathan, why do you
want to be a cop?

07:17.698 --> 07:19.177
- I want to make
a difference, sir.

07:27.534 --> 07:29.274
Get back, get back.

07:30.450 --> 07:31.407
Get back!

07:31.494 --> 07:32.887
Fire.

07:40.372 --> 07:41.765
I want to protect
and serve, sir.

07:41.852 --> 07:43.463
I want to be a better man, sir.

07:45.334 --> 07:46.466
- We'll see about that.

07:46.553 --> 07:48.424
- Put your hands on the ground.

07:49.599 --> 07:51.166
- Welcome to the force.

07:51.253 --> 07:53.037
Congratulations, Hickory.

07:53.124 --> 07:54.386
You made it.

07:54.474 --> 07:55.431
- Thank you, sir.
- Proud of you.

08:38.474 --> 08:40.128
- Hey!
- Hey.

08:41.390 --> 08:42.086
- How did it go?

08:43.523 --> 08:45.350
- I don't think
I did that great.

08:46.656 --> 08:48.876
- I'm sure you did better
than what you think, right?

08:48.963 --> 08:49.703
- Yeah.

08:50.834 --> 08:53.054
- Well, listen.

08:53.141 --> 08:53.924
You're smart.

08:55.404 --> 08:56.579
You know what you're doing.

08:58.059 --> 09:01.715
I'm sure you're going to figure
out a way to get in there,

09:01.802 --> 09:02.542
right?

09:03.455 --> 09:04.369
- Yeah.

09:05.762 --> 09:07.068
- I guess that's
why you're looking

09:07.155 --> 09:09.505
at the new Officer Hickory.

09:09.592 --> 09:10.375
- No?

09:11.986 --> 09:13.161
- Oh yeah.
- Yeah?

09:13.248 --> 09:14.031
- Oh yeah!

09:16.425 --> 09:18.296
- I'm so happy for you!

09:19.907 --> 09:21.125
- Put this on, strap up.

09:26.261 --> 09:27.218
Ready?

09:41.972 --> 09:43.365
Stacy, did I ever
tell you the story

09:43.452 --> 09:45.323
of the most beautiful
girl in the world?

09:45.410 --> 09:46.194
- No.

09:47.804 --> 09:48.718
- Once upon a time,

09:48.805 --> 09:50.372
there was a girl so beautiful

09:50.459 --> 09:52.809
she lit up every
room she walked into.

09:54.376 --> 09:57.988
She was confident,
with piercing bluish,

09:59.555 --> 10:02.602
greenish eyes that
always changed colors,

10:02.689 --> 10:05.996
and radiant blonde hair that
shined like the morning sun.

10:07.476 --> 10:09.217
Now you might be wondering
whatever happened

10:09.304 --> 10:10.435
to the most beautiful
girl in the world?

10:10.522 --> 10:13.613
Well, she met some lucky chump,

10:13.700 --> 10:15.397
gave him her number on a napkin

10:15.484 --> 10:20.315
with a note that
said don't lose this.

10:26.582 --> 10:27.365
I didn't.

10:36.723 --> 10:37.724
Stacy Evangeline.

10:39.682 --> 10:42.424
They say in life we only
fall in love three times,

10:43.773 --> 10:48.473
but I've been falling in
love with you 365 days a year

10:48.560 --> 10:50.562
for the last three
years of my life.

10:51.694 --> 10:56.612
And if you promise
not to lose this,

10:57.961 --> 11:01.530
I plan on falling in
love with you over,

11:01.617 --> 11:03.358
and over, and over again,

11:03.445 --> 11:04.794
for the rest of my life.

11:07.536 --> 11:10.408
So will the most beautiful
girl in the world marry me?

11:29.689 --> 11:32.082
- I wish your father were here.

11:32.953 --> 11:33.780
- Yeah, me too.

11:33.867 --> 11:35.695
- He's be so proud of you.

11:36.870 --> 11:39.394
Oh, I love you my son.

11:39.481 --> 11:40.830
- I love you, mom.

11:40.917 --> 11:43.659
- Oh, I know that!
- I know you do.

11:45.748 --> 11:47.141
- I'm so happy for you.

11:49.360 --> 11:50.144
- Oh, mom.

11:54.626 --> 11:55.366
Bye mom.

12:11.165 --> 12:13.645
Stacy was the best thing
that ever happened to me.

12:15.865 --> 12:17.606
She's the reason I'm here today.

12:21.044 --> 12:22.393
She's the love of my life.

12:27.398 --> 12:28.748
I really don't deserve her.

12:31.228 --> 12:32.882
- She sounds like
an amazing woman.

12:34.492 --> 12:35.319
- She is.

12:36.581 --> 12:38.540
- What happened to
that happy couple?

12:40.368 --> 12:41.673
When did things go wrong?

12:46.026 --> 12:48.506
- On my honor, I
will never betray my badge,

12:48.593 --> 12:50.073
my integrity, my character,

12:50.160 --> 12:51.683
or the public trust.

12:51.771 --> 12:53.816
I will always have the
courage to hold myself

12:53.903 --> 12:55.687
and others accountable
for our actions.

12:55.775 --> 12:57.951
I will also hold
the constitution,

12:58.038 --> 13:00.170
the community, and
the agency I serve,

13:00.257 --> 13:00.997
So help me, God.

13:20.364 --> 13:21.626
- Officer Hickory?

13:21.713 --> 13:22.497
- Yes, sir.

13:24.194 --> 13:26.196
- Steve Watson, field
training officer.

13:26.283 --> 13:27.241
- Nice to meet you.

13:27.328 --> 13:28.590
- You ready?
- Yeah.

13:28.677 --> 13:29.721
- Let's go.

13:33.595 --> 13:34.944
So I read your file.

13:35.031 --> 13:36.598
Looks like you were
top of your class,

13:36.685 --> 13:37.729
but trust me,

13:37.817 --> 13:39.079
there is no training that could

13:39.166 --> 13:40.776
prepare you for the streets.

13:40.863 --> 13:44.345
Look, I know you just got
married and you're all excited.

13:44.432 --> 13:45.955
I get it.

13:46.042 --> 13:47.696
But you got to get your
head out of the clouds, son.

13:47.783 --> 13:49.698
These streets are tough.

13:49.785 --> 13:51.482
If you aren't sharp and focused,

13:51.569 --> 13:52.919
these streets will
eat you alive,

13:53.006 --> 13:54.529
and it will get you
killed, do you understand?

13:54.616 --> 13:55.399
- Yes, sir.

13:55.486 --> 13:56.748
Look, I'm here to learn.

13:56.836 --> 13:57.880
You won't have to
worry about me.

13:57.967 --> 13:59.186
- Let's get this straight.

14:00.143 --> 14:01.710
I run a tight ship.

14:01.797 --> 14:03.016
We do it by the book.

14:03.103 --> 14:04.408
If you want to
get trained by me,

14:04.495 --> 14:07.150
you do what I say,
when I say it.

14:07.237 --> 14:09.544
If you hesitate, it
could cost you your life.

14:11.111 --> 14:12.721
Now fix your collar.

14:12.808 --> 14:14.723
You're a professional and
you need to look like one.

14:15.724 --> 14:17.334
- Bet you're fun at parties.

14:17.421 --> 14:18.683
- No, I am not fun.

14:18.770 --> 14:19.728
Now get in the car.

14:25.255 --> 14:27.214
- So are we getting
some donuts or what?

14:29.651 --> 14:31.087
- New rule.

14:31.174 --> 14:33.263
You have something
stupid to say, don't.

14:35.613 --> 14:37.006
- Yes sir.

14:37.093 --> 14:39.226
Dispatch to Unit 71.

14:39.313 --> 14:40.270
- This us?

14:40.357 --> 14:42.011
- 71, go ahead.

14:42.098 --> 14:44.318
- Respond to
the area of ridge salvage yard

14:44.405 --> 14:46.798
in the 900 block of Thurman Road

14:46.886 --> 14:48.191
for the reports of shots fired.

14:48.278 --> 14:50.237
A caller stated
at least two males

14:50.324 --> 14:51.891
armed with assault rifles,

14:51.978 --> 14:54.676
multiple shots heard,
no further description.

15:03.380 --> 15:04.860
- In the 71, on location.

15:04.947 --> 15:05.600
- This is it, huh?

15:05.687 --> 15:06.601
So what's the plan.

15:06.688 --> 15:08.037
- Keep your head on a swivel.

15:08.124 --> 15:09.343
We don't know what
we're walking into.

15:09.430 --> 15:10.431
Here's your pack and tourniquet.

15:10.518 --> 15:11.301
- What?

15:24.793 --> 15:27.056
- Base, shots fired.

15:27.143 --> 15:29.711
Hope they showed you
how to use that thing.

15:45.205 --> 15:46.771
Right, we got to go.

15:50.340 --> 15:53.822
- I'm gonna
check this corner.

16:20.109 --> 16:21.328
Hear that?

16:21.415 --> 16:22.590
- Mhm.

16:23.808 --> 16:25.201
- That's them.

16:25.288 --> 16:27.160
- Yep.

16:27.247 --> 16:28.726
- All right,
I'm gonna move on.

16:28.813 --> 16:30.380
- I got you.

16:35.342 --> 16:37.474
- Police,
put your gun down now!

16:37.561 --> 16:38.867
Put your gun down!

16:38.954 --> 16:41.870
I will shoot, put
your gun down now.

16:41.957 --> 16:43.393
Put your gun down now.

16:43.480 --> 16:44.786
Now!

17:09.637 --> 17:10.638
I almost shot him.

17:10.725 --> 17:12.814
- I know.

17:12.901 --> 17:15.904
- I almost shot him.
- I know, but you didn't.

17:15.991 --> 17:16.774
You know why?

17:16.861 --> 17:18.298
You used your brain.

17:18.385 --> 17:19.777
Good instincts, son.

17:19.864 --> 17:21.866
Good instincts, come on.

17:36.055 --> 17:37.012
- Police, freeze.

17:37.099 --> 17:37.882
Get on the ground now!

17:37.969 --> 17:39.188
- What's going on?

17:40.102 --> 17:41.234
- All of
you on the ground now,

17:41.321 --> 17:42.713
hands where I can see them.

17:47.805 --> 17:51.374
- Officer, I got a couple cold
ones if you just let me go.

17:51.461 --> 17:52.854
- I don't drink on the job, man.

17:52.941 --> 17:53.985
Come on, watch your head.

18:01.819 --> 18:03.125
- Hey, hey,
hey.

18:03.212 --> 18:04.909
You did a good job
today, all right?

18:06.520 --> 18:07.260
- Thanks.

18:12.743 --> 18:13.570
- Hi!

18:13.657 --> 18:14.963
- Hey baby, how are you?

18:15.050 --> 18:17.444
- I'm good, I'm
just grading papers.

18:17.531 --> 18:18.445
- Yeah?

18:18.532 --> 18:20.011
- Is everything okay?

18:20.099 --> 18:21.622
- Yeah, everything's going fine.

18:22.753 --> 18:25.843
It's a slow night,
pretty boring actually.

18:26.888 --> 18:28.063
- Well, I miss you.

18:28.150 --> 18:29.064
- I miss you too.

18:30.326 --> 18:32.067
I just wanted to call
and hear your voice,

18:32.154 --> 18:33.373
and tell you I love you.

18:34.678 --> 18:35.723
- I love you too.

18:38.900 --> 18:40.293
- Yeah.

18:40.380 --> 18:42.295
Well look, I got to go,

18:42.382 --> 18:43.992
so don't wait up for me, okay?

18:46.777 --> 18:47.909
Good night, I love you.

18:53.219 --> 18:54.785
Sorry about that.

18:54.872 --> 18:56.570
- Hey man, it's all right.

18:56.657 --> 19:00.008
Listen, you did the
right thing over there.

19:00.095 --> 19:02.750
We don't need to bring
this world into our homes.

19:02.837 --> 19:04.926
Our families don't need to
know what's going on out here.

19:05.013 --> 19:07.015
- Any available
unit respond to code three,

19:07.102 --> 19:07.972
the Shinston Road
on the interstate--

19:08.059 --> 19:08.756
- Let's go.

19:10.584 --> 19:11.933
- With the
report of a motor vehicle crash,

19:12.020 --> 19:13.543
with entrapment and injury.

19:13.630 --> 19:16.329
Report of a vehicle down
on embankment on it's side.

19:16.416 --> 19:17.765
Witnesses reporting
vehicles appeared

19:17.852 --> 19:19.462
to be racing before the crash.

19:19.549 --> 19:24.511
Unknown if any other vehicles
were involved at this time.

19:28.079 --> 19:32.519
- Check that
vehicle, I'll check this one.

19:38.220 --> 19:39.265
- Dispatch, this looks serious.

19:39.352 --> 19:40.744
11 80, put a rush on that body.

19:40.831 --> 19:41.528
Hey, Police,

19:41.615 --> 19:42.877
stay right there.

19:42.964 --> 19:45.314
10 for Unit 44.

19:59.198 --> 19:59.981
- Sydney.

20:02.113 --> 20:02.984
She was 16.

20:05.334 --> 20:07.249
Sydney would never
get to fall in love.

20:09.120 --> 20:10.339
She would never get married,

20:11.732 --> 20:13.212
never experience motherhood.

20:14.604 --> 20:17.085
All her hopes, dreams,

20:18.042 --> 20:19.000
gone.

20:20.349 --> 20:23.222
Her entire life
flashed before my eyes.

20:53.774 --> 20:56.080
- You doing all right?

20:56.167 --> 21:00.955
- I've never seen someone
dead like that before.

21:03.479 --> 21:06.134
- Look, police work isn't easy.

21:08.136 --> 21:10.660
You see a lot of crazy
things out there.

21:12.314 --> 21:14.621
Let me tell you
something, off the record.

21:16.362 --> 21:18.320
I found one thing that helps
me get through all of this.

21:19.887 --> 21:20.670
- What's that?

21:21.932 --> 21:24.108
- Couldn't do this
job without Jesus.

21:24.195 --> 21:26.763
- Really?
- Yeah.

21:26.850 --> 21:28.243
Here, take this.

21:31.507 --> 21:32.334
That's our church.

21:34.815 --> 21:36.120
You should stop by some time.

21:37.644 --> 21:39.254
Come on, let's go.

21:54.313 --> 21:55.792
- Death
notifications.

21:58.621 --> 22:00.406
This is the hardest
part of my job.

22:04.671 --> 22:05.802
They have no idea, huh?

22:08.457 --> 22:09.937
- No idea whatsoever.

22:17.031 --> 22:18.162
- What are you doing?

22:20.164 --> 22:21.165
- Reading the Bible.

22:24.386 --> 22:25.169
- Why?

22:28.129 --> 22:29.870
- Because it helps me.

22:37.965 --> 22:41.621
- How do you tell
a mother her child just died?

23:04.861 --> 23:05.645
- No, no,
no.

23:29.712 --> 23:32.193
- Hey rook,
here's a drink for you.

23:32.280 --> 23:33.368
- Who are you?

23:33.455 --> 23:34.325
- I'm Thomas.

23:34.413 --> 23:35.631
- Jonathan, nice to meet you.

23:35.718 --> 23:37.328
- Good to meet you.
- Thank you.

23:37.416 --> 23:41.463
- I heard you ran into some
West Virginia's finest today?

23:42.333 --> 23:43.987
- Yeah, that's
one way to put it.

23:46.425 --> 23:48.557
I don't know how you
guys do this, man.

23:48.644 --> 23:49.906
- Hey, look kid.

23:49.993 --> 23:52.300
After a while you
get used to it.

23:52.387 --> 23:54.215
- Yeah, some days
you're out there

23:54.302 --> 23:56.478
doing paperwork for eight hours,

23:56.565 --> 23:58.480
and the next day
you're getting shot at.

24:00.308 --> 24:01.396
- Where's Watson.

24:01.483 --> 24:03.267
- Oh, guys a square.

24:03.354 --> 24:04.399
Doesn't drink at all.

24:04.486 --> 24:05.835
He'll never step foot in here.

24:08.359 --> 24:10.318
- We heard
about the girl.

24:10.405 --> 24:11.450
How are you handling that?

24:15.584 --> 24:17.020
- I mean, I've never experienced

24:17.107 --> 24:18.935
something like that
before in my life.

24:20.328 --> 24:21.721
It is what it is.

24:21.808 --> 24:22.591
- Hey guys, to the rookie.

24:23.592 --> 24:24.985
- To the rookie.

24:25.072 --> 24:26.334
- Get
that glass up to here.

24:26.421 --> 24:27.248
- To the rookie.

24:27.335 --> 24:28.379
- Thank you.

24:34.777 --> 24:35.648
- It'll get easier.

24:37.214 --> 24:39.956
Sooner or later, you
won't feel a thing.

24:44.091 --> 24:45.745
- You
have a good night.

24:46.920 --> 24:48.443
- You be safe,
thanks for riding.

25:07.462 --> 25:08.376
- Hi.

25:08.463 --> 25:09.420
- Hey.

25:09.508 --> 25:10.639
- Oh, you stink.

25:12.336 --> 25:13.686
Mm, where have you been?

25:15.949 --> 25:17.298
- Few of the guys,

25:17.385 --> 25:19.648
they wanted to celebrate
the rookies first day.

25:21.041 --> 25:21.911
Couldn't say no.

25:23.086 --> 25:24.523
- So how was the
rookie's first day?

25:38.754 --> 25:40.495
- It was different.

25:43.803 --> 25:46.806
My FTI was a nice guy, I met
him for the first time today.

25:48.590 --> 25:50.113
We got donuts and joked around.

25:54.074 --> 25:54.857
- Good.

25:56.424 --> 25:57.294
- Now go get some rest,

25:57.381 --> 25:58.905
I'll catch up with you, okay?

26:03.039 --> 26:03.910
- I love you.

26:03.997 --> 26:06.390
- I love you too.

27:22.118 --> 27:23.467
- No, no,
no.

27:34.827 --> 27:35.784
- Thank you.

27:41.572 --> 27:44.706
Can y'all help me
pray for my husband?

27:50.016 --> 27:52.583
The Lord, Jonathan
is a good man,

27:53.759 --> 27:56.413
but I think this job is
more than he expected.

27:58.677 --> 28:00.287
I think that he sees things

28:01.767 --> 28:03.682
that he can't talk
to anybody about.

28:07.033 --> 28:10.689
I sense that it's hurting him.

28:12.168 --> 28:14.301
It's changing him.

28:16.956 --> 28:18.784
I feel like he's
feeling hopeless,

28:20.133 --> 28:21.612
and he needs you, God.

28:24.615 --> 28:29.620
I know that God can help him,

28:33.450 --> 28:35.278
and that through
the power of Jesus,

28:35.365 --> 28:36.715
that I can get my husband back.

28:44.026 --> 28:44.766
Amen.

28:52.121 --> 28:53.514
- Hey Jonathan, come on in.

28:53.601 --> 28:54.471
- Lieutenant.

28:54.558 --> 28:55.864
- It's good to see you.

28:55.951 --> 28:56.996
- It's
great to see you.

28:57.083 --> 28:57.823
- Please have a seat.

28:59.259 --> 29:01.130
So I've been
talking to your FTO,

29:01.217 --> 29:03.480
and he tells me you
have some talent.

29:03.567 --> 29:04.699
- Just doing my job, sir.

29:04.786 --> 29:06.353
- Well, that's
certainly good to hear.

29:06.440 --> 29:08.355
Apparently you're
doing it really well.

29:08.442 --> 29:10.574
We're thinking
about moving you up.

29:10.661 --> 29:12.272
How you feel about the
traffic safety end?

29:12.359 --> 29:13.012
- You pulling my leg?

29:13.099 --> 29:14.753
- No, I am not.

29:14.840 --> 29:18.278
As part of that, you get a
motorcycle and an unmarked car.

29:18.365 --> 29:19.496
Congratulations, son.

29:21.368 --> 29:22.673
- Wow, this,

29:23.718 --> 29:25.372
it's an honor, sir.

29:25.459 --> 29:26.329
Thank you so much.

29:26.416 --> 29:27.069
- Well, you know what?

29:27.156 --> 29:28.070
You've earned it.

29:28.157 --> 29:29.158
Just don't make me regret it.

29:29.245 --> 29:30.290
- I'll do my best--

29:30.377 --> 29:31.334
- All right.

29:32.379 --> 29:34.337
- Look at that, nice.

29:34.424 --> 29:35.817
Yeah, and we can afford that,

29:35.904 --> 29:37.863
but they can't upgrade
my crappy cruiser.

29:37.950 --> 29:39.429
- I know, kills me.

29:39.516 --> 29:41.518
- Wow, who's the lucky chump?

29:41.605 --> 29:42.693
- No idea.

29:42.781 --> 29:44.347
Certainly isn't you, Hickory.

29:47.698 --> 29:50.005
- Oh, no way.

29:50.092 --> 29:51.877
- There's no way on God's green

29:51.964 --> 29:54.096
earth they're
entrusting that to you.

29:57.317 --> 29:59.493
Hey, were you able to
find a big enough helmet

29:59.580 --> 30:00.581
to go over that head of yours?

30:00.668 --> 30:01.930
- Don't be mad they don't make

30:02.017 --> 30:04.585
these for senior
citizens, Rodriguez.

30:04.672 --> 30:06.195
- Oh, that's cold dude.

30:06.282 --> 30:07.327
- What was that?

30:07.414 --> 30:08.763
- That is cold, bro.

30:08.850 --> 30:10.112
That's cold.

30:10.199 --> 30:11.679
- One more time,
I can't hear you?

30:11.766 --> 30:13.420
- That's cold, bro.

30:15.248 --> 30:17.554
Man, I can't believe
he's got that ride.

30:17.641 --> 30:19.121
- I know.

30:21.863 --> 30:22.951
Dispatch to Unit 44.

30:23.038 --> 30:24.692
- 44, go ahead.

30:24.779 --> 30:26.650
- 44 respond
code three to the intersection

30:26.737 --> 30:28.739
of Second Street
and Maple Avenue.

30:28.827 --> 30:31.133
We have report of a
single vehicle overturned,

30:31.220 --> 30:34.049
multiple occupants, possibly
children in the vehicle,

30:34.136 --> 30:35.181
unknown injury.

30:35.268 --> 30:36.573
Fire and rescue are responding.

30:36.660 --> 30:38.880
- 44, 10 four.

32:08.448 --> 32:09.623
- That bad, huh?

32:13.105 --> 32:14.062
- Whole family.

32:17.892 --> 32:18.893
It was horrible.

32:25.160 --> 32:26.770
- What
can I say, kid?

32:26.857 --> 32:29.773
It's part of the job.

32:31.819 --> 32:32.820
Someone's got to do it.

34:54.440 --> 34:56.833
- Johnathan, you not hungry?

35:07.017 --> 35:08.062
Jonathan?

36:41.503 --> 36:42.722
- Hey, kid.

36:42.809 --> 36:44.114
Mrs Hickory, where is she?

36:44.202 --> 36:45.638
- Excuse me, is everything okay?

36:45.725 --> 36:47.205
- Yeah, I'm just
looking for my wife.

36:47.292 --> 36:49.468
- Oh, third door on the left.

36:49.555 --> 36:50.643
Hey, walking feet!

36:50.730 --> 36:53.298
Are you okay, sweetie?

36:53.385 --> 36:55.735
- So, can anybody
tell me what this is?

36:56.605 --> 36:57.519
- Good job.

36:58.564 --> 37:00.130
And how about this?

37:00.218 --> 37:01.088
- Funnel.

37:01.175 --> 37:02.742
- Funnel, good job.

37:02.829 --> 37:04.352
And what about this?

37:06.876 --> 37:07.747
- We're having a baby?

37:07.834 --> 37:09.357
We're having a baby?

37:12.142 --> 37:13.753
I'm gonna be a dad!

37:22.718 --> 37:25.591
- Look what we
made, she's perfect.

37:29.290 --> 37:30.683
- Let her sleep.

39:54.783 --> 39:56.437
Okay, all right.

39:56.524 --> 39:57.482
You got her?

39:59.266 --> 40:01.094
And you know her sleep schedule,

40:02.661 --> 40:04.837
and you know she gets
fed in 20 minutes, right?

40:04.924 --> 40:07.187
- Mhm.

40:07.274 --> 40:08.710
- Are you sure you need me?

40:08.797 --> 40:09.711
- No, we're fine.

40:09.798 --> 40:10.538
- You sure?

40:11.496 --> 40:12.758
Okay.

40:12.845 --> 40:13.672
And you're going
to call me, right?

40:14.934 --> 40:15.674
- Yeah.

40:15.761 --> 40:17.066
- Okay.

40:35.345 --> 40:36.390
- Shh.

40:38.000 --> 40:38.784
Shh.

42:40.122 --> 42:42.168
- Drunk driving is
still the number one

42:42.255 --> 42:43.996
cause of death on our roadways.

42:45.084 --> 42:47.434
Two out of three
people will be impacted

42:47.521 --> 42:49.828
by a drunk driving
crash in their lifetime,

42:51.394 --> 42:54.093
which is why we take this
award very seriously.

42:54.180 --> 42:56.399
It is reserved for an officer,

42:56.486 --> 42:59.098
an exceptional
officer who has gone

42:59.185 --> 43:02.101
above and beyond to
keep our streets safe.

43:03.537 --> 43:05.017
He is a shining
example of someone

43:06.714 --> 43:09.587
who is making our
community a better place.

43:10.762 --> 43:13.678
It is my honor to
present this award

43:13.765 --> 43:16.594
to Officer Jonathan Hickory.

43:20.467 --> 43:21.511
- Hey.

43:23.470 --> 43:25.777
- Johnathan, you
reek of alcohol.

43:28.867 --> 43:31.652
- Thank you
for your service.

43:33.393 --> 43:34.176
- Wow.

43:37.832 --> 43:38.746
Thank you everyone.

43:40.356 --> 43:43.621
It is an honor and a pleasure
to stand here before you all.

43:43.708 --> 43:45.971
Family comes first in our lives.

43:47.712 --> 43:49.322
With another baby on the way,

43:49.409 --> 43:52.238
we know just how important it
is to keep our streets safe.

43:56.808 --> 44:01.639
I unfortunately know better

44:01.726 --> 44:04.250
than most the horrific,

44:05.599 --> 44:07.601
tragic effects of drunk driving.

44:11.518 --> 44:15.391
It's heartbreaking
to say the least.

44:20.353 --> 44:23.269
The effects of
drunk driving aren't

44:24.444 --> 44:27.621
just limited to
those in the impact,

44:29.710 --> 44:31.059
to our family members,

44:33.758 --> 44:34.541
our friends,

44:39.198 --> 44:39.981
our kids.

44:48.120 --> 44:48.860
Thank you.

44:57.782 --> 44:59.479
Dispatch to 44.

44:59.566 --> 45:01.176
- 44, go ahead.

45:01.263 --> 45:03.004
- Respond to
the 400 block of Early Road,

45:03.091 --> 45:05.572
report of a crash
involving a motorcycle.

45:05.659 --> 45:06.529
- 44, copy.

45:06.616 --> 45:07.400
I'm on my way.

45:19.629 --> 45:21.501
Hey, what have you got for me?

45:22.720 --> 45:24.896
- Hey man, took you long enough.

45:24.983 --> 45:26.724
I actually do have
something for you.

45:27.681 --> 45:29.596
Here, it's his wallet.

45:29.683 --> 45:30.989
- Whose wallet?

45:31.076 --> 45:33.382
- The guy on the
motorcycle, he's over there.

45:36.995 --> 45:37.865
- Oh, man.

45:39.649 --> 45:40.738
- What?

45:42.827 --> 45:45.133
- I know this guy, I went
to high school with him.

45:48.571 --> 45:50.660
Uh, where did you say?

45:51.661 --> 45:55.796
- Right over there,
under that white sheet.

46:02.063 --> 46:03.804
- Thanks.
- Sorry, bud.

47:25.059 --> 47:26.017
- Get out.

47:26.104 --> 47:27.018
Get out now.

47:27.105 --> 47:27.845
Get out.

47:30.238 --> 47:33.024
Look at what you did,
look at what you did.

47:33.111 --> 47:34.852
He had a family, and a wife,

47:34.939 --> 47:36.636
and you killed him.

47:36.723 --> 47:38.725
You killed him!

47:38.812 --> 47:39.857
You killed him.

47:40.901 --> 47:43.208
Look at this, look at this.

47:44.818 --> 47:47.255
You killed him, you killed him.

49:00.938 --> 49:02.940
I couldn't understand
why they weren't angry.

49:04.506 --> 49:06.247
I looked into the
eyes of that family

49:07.901 --> 49:09.555
and all I saw was sadness.

49:11.774 --> 49:12.688
Pure sadness.

49:12.775 --> 49:14.168
No anger, no resentment.

49:15.604 --> 49:16.954
They just missed their kid.

49:19.913 --> 49:22.394
They should be angry at
the drunk who killed him.

49:24.048 --> 49:25.136
They should hate him.

49:29.009 --> 49:30.706
But they couldn't.

49:30.793 --> 49:31.925
They were calm, and peaceful,

49:32.012 --> 49:33.883
and that infuriated me.

49:35.581 --> 49:37.148
He was this drunk who
just took the life

49:37.235 --> 49:40.978
of their loved one over some
stupid bottle of liqueur,

49:41.065 --> 49:43.110
and they just forgave him.

49:43.197 --> 49:44.198
Just like that.

49:48.986 --> 49:50.465
If there's one thing I know,

49:53.120 --> 49:55.905
its that we're all gonna end
up dead with no hope anyway.

49:58.212 --> 49:59.822
What's the point in this life?

50:01.607 --> 50:03.957
What difference does
it make, and who cares?

50:07.439 --> 50:08.396
I don't understand.

50:10.529 --> 50:12.444
Where was Jesus when
that guy swerved

50:12.531 --> 50:14.359
through three lanes
and killed Daniel?

50:16.491 --> 50:18.363
- Jonathan, Jesus
didn't kill Daniel.

50:21.061 --> 50:22.454
Why don't you blame Satan?

50:23.585 --> 50:25.283
- Oh God, come on Satan.

50:25.370 --> 50:27.763
- Oh, so it's okay to
blame Jesus for everything,

50:27.850 --> 50:28.938
but not Satan?

50:30.244 --> 50:33.900
Not the one that the Bible
tells us comes to steal,

50:33.987 --> 50:35.554
kill, and destroy?

50:35.641 --> 50:36.685
He gets no credit?

50:37.904 --> 50:42.865
That family had peace
because they know Jesus.

50:45.433 --> 50:48.741
Because they know there's
more to this life.

50:50.960 --> 50:54.921
Because this life
is not perfect.

50:55.008 --> 50:55.835
It's broken.

50:57.054 --> 50:59.230
We broke it, sin broke it.

51:03.756 --> 51:06.933
- I'm having a really
hard time buying that.

51:07.020 --> 51:07.890
- If you got it all figured out,

51:07.977 --> 51:09.849
then what are we doing here?

51:09.936 --> 51:10.850
- I don't know.

51:10.937 --> 51:12.156
- Why did you want to talk?

51:12.243 --> 51:14.245
Do you want help?

51:14.332 --> 51:15.768
I'm trying to help you.

51:18.075 --> 51:19.163
- You wouldn't understand.

51:21.382 --> 51:23.210
- Then make me understand.

51:27.997 --> 51:29.956
- It was Sunday, October 20th.

51:32.132 --> 51:33.090
My wife was in her 20th week.

51:53.849 --> 51:54.589
Stacy?

51:56.156 --> 51:58.027
- Make it
stop, it hurts.

51:58.115 --> 51:58.767
- Stacy,
are you okay?

51:58.854 --> 52:00.117
Stacy, open up.

52:00.204 --> 52:01.944
- Stacy passed the
baby, call 911.

52:05.034 --> 52:06.514
- What do you mean
she passed the baby?

52:06.601 --> 52:07.863
- Stacy passed the baby.

52:07.950 --> 52:10.562
Go Jonathan, call 911.

52:17.264 --> 52:19.397
- My wife is 20 weeks pregnant,

52:20.441 --> 52:22.922
and she just,

52:24.053 --> 52:25.098
she just passed the baby.

52:47.207 --> 52:49.514
I can't do this.

52:49.601 --> 52:50.993
I can't do this.

53:08.141 --> 53:09.969
At 14 weeks, the brain impulses

53:10.056 --> 53:12.058
in an unborn baby begin to fire.

53:14.800 --> 53:17.368
At 15 weeks, the unborn
baby can sense light.

53:20.675 --> 53:23.635
At 19 weeks, the babies
senses are all developing.

53:23.722 --> 53:25.202
Touch, taste,

53:25.289 --> 53:26.551
vision, smell,

53:26.638 --> 53:27.378
and hearing.

53:31.556 --> 53:33.079
Christian was 20 weeks old.

54:06.068 --> 54:11.030
- Dear God, hear us as
we pray for .

54:13.467 --> 54:17.297
We pray for their comfort
in a time of sadness.

54:19.299 --> 54:23.695
Hear,
in this trying time.

54:25.653 --> 54:30.354
We pray that you lift their
child into a kingdom of light.

54:33.835 --> 54:36.142
In your name we pray, amen.

55:19.664 --> 55:21.405
- I'll clean up, okay?

55:32.198 --> 55:33.242
- Look.

55:35.201 --> 55:37.377
You are not alone, all right?

55:42.513 --> 55:44.341
You should come
to church with us.

58:14.621 --> 58:16.580
- God, I pray for my husband.

58:20.497 --> 58:21.715
He is a good man.

58:25.632 --> 58:28.505
I know deep down
he's a good man.

58:30.463 --> 58:32.378
But he needs you.

58:32.465 --> 58:33.553
He needs your help.

58:37.601 --> 58:40.908
He's still the man that I love.

58:40.995 --> 58:42.170
He's my Jonah,

58:46.305 --> 58:47.436
and he's lost at sea.

58:50.788 --> 58:51.832
He needs you.

58:57.098 --> 58:58.447
This is my last prayer, God,

59:00.362 --> 59:04.018
and I don't know how,
but he needs your help.

59:11.417 --> 59:14.028
We need your help
for our family.

59:16.074 --> 59:16.857
For me.

59:18.555 --> 59:19.556
For Ana.

59:22.733 --> 59:23.864
For Jonathan.

59:25.257 --> 59:30.218
I need you to
bring him back to me.

59:34.005 --> 59:35.659
Please help him, God.

59:39.532 --> 59:40.577
Bring him back.

59:48.541 --> 59:49.803
- Okay, yep.

59:49.890 --> 59:51.239
Officer Hickory,

59:51.326 --> 59:52.458
report to Lieutenant
Campbell's office.

59:52.545 --> 59:53.720
- Let me call you back.

1:00:10.694 --> 1:00:11.695
- Johnathan, come in.

1:00:14.045 --> 1:00:16.177
These detectives are
from internal affairs.

1:00:17.570 --> 1:00:18.571
Have a seat.

1:00:20.660 --> 1:00:22.706
- Can I ask
what this is all about?

1:00:22.793 --> 1:00:25.447
- I think you know
why they're here.

1:00:25.534 --> 1:00:26.448
You're under investigation for

1:00:26.535 --> 1:00:28.276
violating our code of conduct.

1:00:29.930 --> 1:00:31.540
You'd better hope
we don't find out

1:00:31.628 --> 1:00:33.760
you were involved
in immoral conduct.

1:00:33.847 --> 1:00:35.153
You are to hand over your

1:00:35.240 --> 1:00:37.242
departmental laptop
and cell phones,

1:00:37.329 --> 1:00:39.679
along with all the lock
codes and passwords.

1:00:41.202 --> 1:00:43.944
And you will not discuss this
investigation with anyone,

1:00:44.031 --> 1:00:44.771
is that clear?

1:00:47.469 --> 1:00:48.296
You're dismissed.

1:01:18.022 --> 1:01:20.546
- This is the story of Jonah.

1:01:21.808 --> 1:01:23.157
Jonah was a good man,

1:01:25.682 --> 1:01:27.118
but he was scared.

1:01:32.036 --> 1:01:33.646
- What did he do, mommy?

1:01:37.650 --> 1:01:40.566
- Jonah didn't know
that God had a purpose for him,

1:01:43.569 --> 1:01:46.703
that God had a special
mission for him,

1:01:51.229 --> 1:01:54.798
and God found a way
to get his attention.

1:02:00.673 --> 1:02:01.892
God sent a storm,

1:02:06.113 --> 1:02:09.726
and he sent a big fish
to go and get Jonah,

1:02:15.340 --> 1:02:16.733
and bring him back.

1:02:28.527 --> 1:02:31.748
And in the end Jonah
did the right thing.

1:02:39.016 --> 1:02:42.671
He did God's final
wish, and he came back.

1:02:50.679 --> 1:02:52.594
He did the right thing.

1:03:42.775 --> 1:03:45.430
- What's the point of this life?

1:03:45.517 --> 1:03:48.259
What difference does it make?

1:04:30.431 --> 1:04:32.303
- You've seen so much death.

1:04:34.783 --> 1:04:36.873
Your whole profession revolves

1:04:36.960 --> 1:04:38.570
around the evil in this world.

1:04:40.398 --> 1:04:43.618
You see Satan's
handiwork everyday.

1:04:45.882 --> 1:04:46.839
It must be tough.

1:04:51.713 --> 1:04:54.847
The thief comes to steal,

1:04:56.283 --> 1:04:57.023
to kill,

1:04:58.285 --> 1:04:59.373
and to destroy.

1:05:01.941 --> 1:05:05.205
You've let him rob
you of your peace,

1:05:06.772 --> 1:05:09.296
of your family, of your life.

1:05:11.037 --> 1:05:12.386
It's time you fought back.

1:05:30.883 --> 1:05:33.320
You need the only one who's
ever overcome this evil.

1:05:35.279 --> 1:05:36.584
You need Jesus.

1:05:39.674 --> 1:05:42.808
You've been doing things
your way your whole life.

1:05:44.070 --> 1:05:45.724
How's that working out for you?

1:05:48.640 --> 1:05:50.294
It's time you did
things God's way.

1:05:52.252 --> 1:05:53.558
- I don't know.

1:05:55.299 --> 1:05:56.039
- I do.

1:05:58.084 --> 1:06:00.957
You need to be honest
about your affair,

1:06:02.349 --> 1:06:03.872
about your drinking,

1:06:03.960 --> 1:06:05.613
about the way you've been
treating your family.

1:06:06.832 --> 1:06:10.183
There are consequences
to your actions

1:06:11.358 --> 1:06:12.838
and Jesus is not
going to change that.

1:06:15.841 --> 1:06:18.975
But Jesus will change you.

1:06:20.933 --> 1:06:21.978
You want to be a man about this?

1:06:22.065 --> 1:06:23.762
You want to make things right?

1:06:24.893 --> 1:06:25.851
You want to fix it?

1:06:28.941 --> 1:06:31.248
First you have to surrender
yourself to Jesus.

1:06:34.468 --> 1:06:35.556
That's the first step.

1:06:50.180 --> 1:06:53.835
- Honey, I realized I
made a lot of mistakes.

1:06:55.489 --> 1:06:57.056
I know I haven't
been good to you.

1:06:58.144 --> 1:06:59.841
I know I've been a disaster.

1:07:01.800 --> 1:07:03.193
But that's all going to change,

1:07:03.280 --> 1:07:07.762
because last night I
made a promise to God.

1:07:10.026 --> 1:07:12.071
I spoke to him for
the first time,

1:07:13.377 --> 1:07:15.814
and I promised Him that I'm
going to be a better man,

1:07:15.901 --> 1:07:18.556
better father, better husband.

1:07:18.643 --> 1:07:20.732
I'm going to make it
up to you and Ana.

1:07:24.910 --> 1:07:26.999
Stacy, what I'm
asking is forgive me.

1:07:28.696 --> 1:07:29.480
Please.

1:07:38.619 --> 1:07:40.056
- Okay.

1:07:40.143 --> 1:07:41.100
- I'm working on it.

1:07:43.755 --> 1:07:44.973
I'm going to be better.

1:07:54.026 --> 1:07:56.637
- Okay, this one's for you,

1:07:56.724 --> 1:07:58.335
and this one's for me.

1:07:58.422 --> 1:07:59.379
Careful, you got it?

1:08:01.512 --> 1:08:03.818
- Wow, say thank you.

1:08:03.905 --> 1:08:04.906
- Thank you.

1:08:11.304 --> 1:08:13.045
- Jonathan, you do you
know that this is strange,

1:08:13.132 --> 1:08:13.959
right?

1:08:15.265 --> 1:08:19.138
You sitting here with
us getting ice cream,

1:08:19.225 --> 1:08:20.748
spending time with us.

1:08:23.099 --> 1:08:24.622
- It's gonna get better.

1:08:24.709 --> 1:08:26.319
- Exactly what she said.

1:08:29.148 --> 1:08:31.368
- Jonathan, our
family needs this.

1:08:31.455 --> 1:08:34.066
- I know, I promise things
are going to change.

1:08:37.069 --> 1:08:38.331
Next time we're
getting pizza, right?

1:08:38.418 --> 1:08:39.985
- No, ice cream.

1:08:40.072 --> 1:08:41.204
- Ice cream again.

1:08:41.291 --> 1:08:42.683
- Ice cream, uh-huh.

1:08:46.034 --> 1:08:46.557
- Is it good?

1:08:46.644 --> 1:08:47.340
- Yeah.

1:08:47.427 --> 1:08:48.820
- Yeah, all right.

1:08:48.907 --> 1:08:50.169
- I'm
gonna take this, okay?

1:08:50.256 --> 1:08:50.952
Be right back.

1:08:51.039 --> 1:08:51.736
- Okay.

1:08:52.476 --> 1:08:53.999
- Lieutenant?

1:08:54.086 --> 1:08:55.957
- Jonathan, I need to
see you in my office.

1:08:56.044 --> 1:08:57.872
I have to result of
your investigation.

1:08:57.959 --> 1:08:59.004
- What flavor are you
going to get next time?

1:08:59.091 --> 1:08:59.961
- Vanilla.

1:09:00.048 --> 1:09:01.137
- You didn't like this one?

1:09:01.224 --> 1:09:02.834
- No.

1:09:02.921 --> 1:09:04.923
- All right, I guess
I'll see you then.

1:09:16.064 --> 1:09:17.936
- Oh my goodness gracious.

1:09:20.112 --> 1:09:21.418
Who was it?

1:09:21.505 --> 1:09:22.897
- Oh, it was Lieutenant.

1:09:22.984 --> 1:09:23.811
- They need you?

1:09:23.898 --> 1:09:25.596
- No, just saying hi.

1:09:27.075 --> 1:09:27.859
- Okay.

1:10:00.326 --> 1:10:01.022
- You again?

1:10:02.676 --> 1:10:05.026
Well, at least this time you
don't have your gun drawn.

1:10:06.550 --> 1:10:07.464
- I need your help.

1:10:09.857 --> 1:10:10.641
- Sure.

1:10:11.903 --> 1:10:12.860
What's going on?

1:10:18.126 --> 1:10:19.215
- I'm an idiot.

1:10:20.825 --> 1:10:22.305
- I take it you
haven't told her.

1:10:26.091 --> 1:10:27.135
- No, I haven't.

1:10:30.748 --> 1:10:32.097
- You need to tell
her, Jonathan.

1:10:32.184 --> 1:10:33.098
- I can't tell her.

1:10:34.708 --> 1:10:36.319
She's going to
leave and take Ana.

1:10:38.190 --> 1:10:40.018
I don't know what I would
do if I lost them both.

1:10:40.105 --> 1:10:41.846
- Well, if you don't tell her,

1:10:41.933 --> 1:10:43.761
you're going to lose
them both anyway.

1:10:50.202 --> 1:10:53.379
I sense there's
something else going on.

1:10:58.254 --> 1:11:00.995
- The force, they found
out about the affair,

1:11:02.693 --> 1:11:04.347
did an entire investigation.

1:11:06.262 --> 1:11:08.176
I'm about to find
out if I lost my job.

1:11:10.178 --> 1:11:10.918
I screwed up.

1:11:13.312 --> 1:11:15.009
Really, really screwed up.

1:11:16.489 --> 1:11:18.317
I could really use
a prayer right now.

1:11:19.927 --> 1:11:24.671
- I told you before, there are
consequences to your actions,

1:11:24.758 --> 1:11:28.109
and praying won't
make them go away.

1:11:29.850 --> 1:11:32.592
But God promises
to be there to help

1:11:32.679 --> 1:11:34.202
you through those consequences.

1:11:34.290 --> 1:11:35.639
- I'm not asking for a miracle.

1:11:36.727 --> 1:11:38.119
I know there are consequences,

1:11:38.206 --> 1:11:41.079
but I also believe that
God does answer prayers.

1:11:41.166 --> 1:11:45.257
Please could you just
say a prayer with me?

1:11:50.523 --> 1:11:51.307
- Of course.

1:12:15.548 --> 1:12:17.550
- God, please help
me keep my job.

1:12:21.685 --> 1:12:23.034
- You know what,

1:12:23.121 --> 1:12:24.340
being an officer in this
county is a privilege?

1:12:25.906 --> 1:12:27.343
Well do you?

1:12:27.430 --> 1:12:30.084
We demand all of our
officers be beyond reproach.

1:12:30.171 --> 1:12:31.477
All of them.

1:12:31.564 --> 1:12:32.609
And you?

1:12:32.696 --> 1:12:33.523
You don't.

1:12:33.610 --> 1:12:35.089
- Yes sir, I understand--

1:12:35.176 --> 1:12:37.701
- I'm sorry, I believe
I was still speaking.

1:12:37.788 --> 1:12:39.485
As for the charge.

1:12:39.572 --> 1:12:42.227
Officer behaving in a
scandalous, infamous manner,

1:12:42.314 --> 1:12:44.490
in violation of
West Virginia code.

1:12:44.577 --> 1:12:46.362
For that, you're guilty.

1:12:47.798 --> 1:12:50.104
Dismissal without pension,
without severance.

1:12:50.191 --> 1:12:51.236
Nothing.

1:12:53.281 --> 1:12:54.195
That's the verdict.

1:13:22.136 --> 1:13:24.443
- This job is all I know, sir.

1:13:25.357 --> 1:13:26.532
It's my passion.

1:13:28.186 --> 1:13:29.274
It's what I'm good at.

1:13:31.058 --> 1:13:32.495
It's the only thing I'm good at.

1:13:35.019 --> 1:13:37.064
I didn't come here
to make excuses,

1:13:38.283 --> 1:13:39.371
but we both know that this line

1:13:39.458 --> 1:13:40.894
of work gets inside your head,

1:13:42.461 --> 1:13:46.596
and between things I've seen
on the job and losing my son,

1:13:47.292 --> 1:13:48.336
I've been a wreck.

1:13:48.424 --> 1:13:50.208
I've been avoiding my problems,

1:13:50.295 --> 1:13:52.950
and this job is, being here,

1:13:53.037 --> 1:13:54.299
it's the only
thing that makes me

1:13:54.386 --> 1:13:56.214
feel like I'm
making a difference.

1:13:58.303 --> 1:14:00.392
I know I need to be held
accountable for my actions,

1:14:00.479 --> 1:14:01.306
and I don't deserve this job.

1:14:01.393 --> 1:14:03.264
I don't deserve my family.

1:14:04.483 --> 1:14:05.528
But I want you to know
that I'm working on it.

1:14:05.615 --> 1:14:07.530
I'm going to be a better man.

1:14:07.617 --> 1:14:09.227
- Look, Jonathan,

1:14:09.314 --> 1:14:11.098
I know you, okay?

1:14:12.230 --> 1:14:14.972
I know this isn't like you.

1:14:15.059 --> 1:14:16.582
Look at me?

1:14:16.669 --> 1:14:19.542
You know I'm actually willing
to bet my badge on you.

1:14:19.629 --> 1:14:21.195
You know why?

1:14:21.282 --> 1:14:23.807
Because at the end of the day
I think you're a good cop,

1:14:25.504 --> 1:14:27.854
and I truly believe everyone
deserves a second chance.

1:14:29.073 --> 1:14:30.161
That's why I fought for you.

1:14:30.248 --> 1:14:31.597
And guess what?

1:14:32.816 --> 1:14:34.600
That's why I got them to
keep you on the force.

1:14:36.776 --> 1:14:37.734
- Thank you.

1:14:37.821 --> 1:14:38.691
- Oh no, no,
no, no,

1:14:38.778 --> 1:14:40.432
no, don't thank me yet.

1:14:40.519 --> 1:14:42.086
Oh no, you will be disciplined.

1:14:43.391 --> 1:14:46.046
You will no longer be a
motorcycle or traffic officer,

1:14:47.352 --> 1:14:48.309
and that take home vehicle?

1:14:48.396 --> 1:14:50.181
Yeah, that's going.

1:14:50.268 --> 1:14:53.445
You will immediately be sent
to uniform patrol division,

1:14:53.532 --> 1:14:56.274
on a midnight shift,
pushing a cruiser.

1:14:56.361 --> 1:14:59.320
Now give me the keys to the
motorcycle and the unmarked.

1:15:06.371 --> 1:15:07.503
Look, Jonathan?

1:15:09.200 --> 1:15:12.333
I am taking a huge risk on
you, you understand that?

1:15:12.420 --> 1:15:14.118
Huge.

1:15:14.205 --> 1:15:15.728
Tell me I'm not
making a mistake.

1:15:15.815 --> 1:15:17.295
- I won't let you down, sir.

1:15:20.298 --> 1:15:22.430
- These are the keys
to your new ride.

1:15:22.518 --> 1:15:23.388
Car 305.

1:15:27.479 --> 1:15:29.829
You prove to me
that you can change,

1:15:29.916 --> 1:15:34.399
and in a year, maybe we can
reevaluate your performance.

1:15:35.443 --> 1:15:36.532
Don't make me regret this.

1:15:37.620 --> 1:15:38.490
You're dismissed.

1:16:00.425 --> 1:16:02.775
- So what's with the
squad car out there?

1:16:05.430 --> 1:16:06.910
- I got put back on nights.

1:16:06.997 --> 1:16:07.998
Start tomorrow night.

1:16:09.303 --> 1:16:10.740
- What?

1:16:10.827 --> 1:16:12.611
- Yeah, I got some
trouble at work.

1:16:12.698 --> 1:16:14.961
They swapped me over
to midnight shift.

1:16:15.048 --> 1:16:16.354
- Jonathan, how?

1:16:16.441 --> 1:16:19.792
I mean, you've been
working so hard.

1:16:19.879 --> 1:16:20.663
What happened?

1:16:22.142 --> 1:16:23.535
- It was a vehicle
pursuit a few months ago,

1:16:23.622 --> 1:16:24.797
remember the one I
was telling you about?

1:16:24.884 --> 1:16:25.668
- Yes.

1:16:27.408 --> 1:16:28.758
And?

1:16:28.845 --> 1:16:31.369
- And I gave the
suspect a break.

1:16:32.631 --> 1:16:35.416
Didn't write them up, turns
out they had warrants.

1:16:36.592 --> 1:16:39.072
Look, I think I'll like
this better anyways.

1:16:39.159 --> 1:16:41.727
I wont to have to deal
with seeing the wrecks and,

1:16:42.902 --> 1:16:45.122
who knows, maybe
this is a good thing.

1:16:45.209 --> 1:16:46.514
- A good thing?

1:16:47.777 --> 1:16:49.256
Jonathan, how is this
going to be a good thing?

1:16:49.343 --> 1:16:50.606
You're never going to see us.

1:16:50.693 --> 1:16:52.608
- Look, it's only for a while.

1:16:52.695 --> 1:16:53.696
Okay?

1:16:53.783 --> 1:16:54.653
We'll make it work.

1:16:56.307 --> 1:16:58.091
- Yeah, I guess.

1:17:01.704 --> 1:17:04.315
- I love you, don't worry.

1:17:04.402 --> 1:17:06.578
We'll figure it out, okay?

1:17:07.623 --> 1:17:10.495
- Okay.

1:17:45.835 --> 1:17:46.792
44 respond code

1:17:46.879 --> 1:17:48.751
three to Rocco's liquor store,

1:17:48.838 --> 1:17:53.494
1260 East Main Street with
a possible carjacking.

1:17:53.581 --> 1:17:56.106
Caller stated they say a
large male with a beard

1:17:56.193 --> 1:17:59.022
forcing his way into a black
van in the parking lot.

1:18:09.815 --> 1:18:11.382
- Hey, freeze!

1:18:11.469 --> 1:18:12.818
Stop right there!

1:18:23.524 --> 1:18:25.483
Unit 44, I need back up.

1:18:25.570 --> 1:18:26.745
Copy, Unit 44.

1:18:26.832 --> 1:18:28.225
We have back up on the way.

1:18:28.312 --> 1:18:31.576
Any available unit
respond to code three.

1:19:04.087 --> 1:19:05.175
- Don't move!

1:20:16.681 --> 1:20:18.074
- Hi Megan, hi Ana,

1:20:18.161 --> 1:20:19.553
what's going on?

1:20:19.640 --> 1:20:20.728
- I'm taking Ana to
get some ice cream.

1:20:20.816 --> 1:20:21.817
We'll be right back.

1:20:23.166 --> 1:20:24.210
- Oh, okay.

1:20:26.778 --> 1:20:27.605
Hey, what are you doing here?

1:20:27.692 --> 1:20:29.302
- Get in the car Jonathan.

1:20:32.436 --> 1:20:33.263
- What's going on?

1:20:33.350 --> 1:20:34.438
- Just get in the car now.

1:21:03.249 --> 1:21:04.729
- Jonathan, what happened?

1:21:08.907 --> 1:21:11.692
You were my best friend.

1:21:11.779 --> 1:21:14.695
You were the one that I
wanted to spend forever with,

1:21:14.782 --> 1:21:17.568
that I loved unconditionally,

1:21:17.655 --> 1:21:20.832
that I went there and I
took these vows with you.

1:21:24.140 --> 1:21:26.403
Does it not mean
anything to you?

1:21:28.796 --> 1:21:31.843
What happened to my husband
when I lost my baby?

1:21:32.888 --> 1:21:33.801
Where were you?

1:21:36.195 --> 1:21:39.851
You were getting drunk,
you were disappearing,

1:21:39.938 --> 1:21:42.941
you were working night
shifts and everything else.

1:21:43.028 --> 1:21:44.682
This is what you were doing?

1:21:47.772 --> 1:21:51.732
When I laid there every
night aching in pain,

1:21:53.430 --> 1:21:58.261
needing you here, needing my
husband to come home to me,

1:22:00.437 --> 1:22:01.917
to tell me that he loves me,

1:22:06.747 --> 1:22:09.446
and you're out sleeping
with some other woman?

1:22:09.533 --> 1:22:11.927
Do you even know
what you've done?

1:22:13.798 --> 1:22:15.931
Do you know what
you're doing to me?

1:22:20.065 --> 1:22:24.983
You are not the man that I
married and I want him back.

1:22:34.993 --> 1:22:36.038
You broke us.

1:22:37.039 --> 1:22:38.127
You broke me.

1:22:39.476 --> 1:22:40.825
What happened?

1:22:45.873 --> 1:22:48.093
No, because you're not sorry.

1:22:50.748 --> 1:22:52.141
No, don't touch me.

1:23:26.479 --> 1:23:30.005
- Stacy, you should
know that the day

1:23:30.092 --> 1:23:31.658
that Jonathan came to see me,

1:23:33.269 --> 1:23:37.012
he told me all about the
demons he was fighting.

1:23:38.926 --> 1:23:40.624
He told me about the infidelity.

1:23:42.452 --> 1:23:46.151
He also told me that you
are the love of his life,

1:23:47.022 --> 1:23:49.024
and he didn't feel
like he deserved you.

1:23:50.634 --> 1:23:52.201
This is one of
the most difficult

1:23:52.288 --> 1:23:55.465
things that could ever
happen in a marriage.

1:23:57.293 --> 1:24:01.514
Jonathan, it took you years
to break this marriage.

1:24:01.601 --> 1:24:04.909
It's gonna take you a
long time to repair it.

1:24:06.867 --> 1:24:07.868
But you're going to have to ask

1:24:07.955 --> 1:24:09.348
yourself the hardest questions.

1:24:11.437 --> 1:24:12.917
Do you want to fix this?

1:24:16.790 --> 1:24:19.402
Do you want to move
forward to forgiving?

1:24:21.012 --> 1:24:23.884
You're gonna have to look
deep within your heart,

1:24:23.971 --> 1:24:25.364
and you're gonna have to decide

1:24:25.451 --> 1:24:28.802
is this family
worth fighting for?

1:24:35.853 --> 1:24:37.115
It's gonna be a long journey,

1:24:41.511 --> 1:24:46.168
but if you turn toward God,
I think you have a chance.

1:25:27.818 --> 1:25:31.038
There are consequences
to your actions,

1:25:31.126 --> 1:25:32.779
and Jesus will not change that.

1:25:35.130 --> 1:25:38.133
But Jesus will change you.

1:25:40.047 --> 1:25:40.918
You want to be a man about this?

1:25:41.005 --> 1:25:42.702
You want to make things right?

1:25:43.921 --> 1:25:44.835
You want to fix it?

1:25:48.143 --> 1:25:50.188
First you have to surrender
yourself to Jesus.

1:25:53.670 --> 1:25:54.758
That's the first step.

1:26:40.325 --> 1:26:43.285
- I've been a slave to
you for way too long.

1:26:43.372 --> 1:26:47.941
I am sick and tired
of you controlling me.

1:26:55.297 --> 1:26:58.300
God, God please.

1:26:59.779 --> 1:27:02.173
Give me the strength to
break free from these chains.

1:27:39.689 --> 1:27:42.169
I don't know where to begin.

1:27:49.220 --> 1:27:54.181
I hate myself, I hate
what I've done to Stacy,

1:27:55.139 --> 1:27:58.185
to my family, to Ana.

1:28:00.057 --> 1:28:03.365
And the weight of all
this is overwhelming,

1:28:03.452 --> 1:28:05.889
and I'm having a lot of
trouble dealing with it.

1:28:08.413 --> 1:28:09.196
- Jonathan,

1:28:11.198 --> 1:28:14.289
that burden is not
for you to carry.

1:28:16.073 --> 1:28:20.991
That weight on your shoulders
is for Jesus to carry.

1:28:22.166 --> 1:28:24.560
You have to give it to
him, or it'll crush you.

1:28:27.563 --> 1:28:29.565
- I just want my wife
to love me again.

1:28:46.103 --> 1:28:47.234
- It's gonna take time.

1:28:48.932 --> 1:28:50.237
- Hey, I can do that for you--

1:28:50.325 --> 1:28:52.805
- Don't touch me,
stay away from me.

1:28:55.286 --> 1:28:56.461
- It's not gonna be easy.

1:29:04.774 --> 1:29:06.689
You have to push through.

1:29:08.212 --> 1:29:09.822
You have to believe
there's hope.

1:29:11.433 --> 1:29:14.436
She believed for years
that you would turn around.

1:29:17.090 --> 1:29:18.875
Now it's your turn
to believe in her.

1:29:25.664 --> 1:29:30.582
- Jesus, help me become the
man my family needs me to be.

1:29:33.759 --> 1:29:35.631
Forgive me for what I've done.

1:29:38.416 --> 1:29:39.548
Help heal our wounds.

1:29:42.246 --> 1:29:45.336
Help me fix this mess
I've made, please.

1:30:04.964 --> 1:30:06.357
Hi, Ana.

1:30:06.444 --> 1:30:08.446
Could I talk to you for
a second, sweetheart?

1:30:13.320 --> 1:30:14.104
Come here.

1:30:16.498 --> 1:30:19.239
You know your daddy loves
you very much, right?

1:30:19.326 --> 1:30:20.284
Very, very,

1:30:20.371 --> 1:30:21.154
very much.

1:30:22.329 --> 1:30:24.593
Look, I know daddy's
been mean a lot lately,

1:30:25.507 --> 1:30:27.509
and that's not your fault, okay?

1:30:28.771 --> 1:30:30.468
I want you to know
that daddy promises

1:30:30.555 --> 1:30:33.384
to never be mean
to you ever again.

1:30:34.864 --> 1:30:35.604
Okay?

1:30:38.389 --> 1:30:39.912
I love you, sweetheart.

1:30:41.131 --> 1:30:41.914
I'm sorry.

1:30:43.394 --> 1:30:44.439
Could you forgive me?

1:31:33.966 --> 1:31:34.706
- Okay.

1:31:36.534 --> 1:31:40.495
Well, before we can make any
changes together as a couple,

1:31:42.061 --> 1:31:44.586
Jonathan, you're gonna
have to face some things.

1:31:44.673 --> 1:31:48.111
Now I know you
have a lot of hurt

1:31:48.198 --> 1:31:49.504
from the loss of your father,

1:31:50.809 --> 1:31:52.419
so I want you to try something.

1:31:53.812 --> 1:31:56.380
We are going to try an exercise.

1:32:02.560 --> 1:32:05.694
I want you to pretend your
father is sitting in this chair.

1:32:10.873 --> 1:32:15.007
- You want me to play
pretend with that chair?

1:32:15.094 --> 1:32:17.401
- Jonathan, we're going
to have to work on you

1:32:17.488 --> 1:32:19.534
before we can work on
restoring your marriage.

1:32:22.058 --> 1:32:25.496
Now I want you to
speak to this chair

1:32:26.671 --> 1:32:27.890
as if your father
is sitting in it,

1:32:27.977 --> 1:32:29.587
right here in front of you.

1:32:29.674 --> 1:32:32.547
I want you to say all the
things you wanted to say to him.

1:32:50.608 --> 1:32:51.391
- Dad?

1:32:57.006 --> 1:32:57.746
Dad?

1:33:03.795 --> 1:33:05.405
Dad, you were my best friend.

1:33:12.935 --> 1:33:14.066
You were my hero.

1:33:19.768 --> 1:33:20.638
I miss you.

1:33:23.772 --> 1:33:24.990
I wish you were here.

1:33:29.691 --> 1:33:31.388
I wish you were here
to see me graduate

1:33:31.475 --> 1:33:34.086
the Academy to become
a police officer.

1:33:36.436 --> 1:33:38.613
I wish you were here
to see me marry Stacy,

1:33:40.266 --> 1:33:41.920
and meet your
granddaughter, Ana.

1:33:45.097 --> 1:33:46.490
She's just like you,

1:33:46.577 --> 1:33:48.274
smart, funny.

1:33:53.279 --> 1:33:55.064
I want to tell you
that I love you,

1:33:55.151 --> 1:33:58.633
because I feel like I didn't
have enough time to tell you.

1:34:00.286 --> 1:34:01.200
It's not fair.

1:34:04.421 --> 1:34:05.465
I never heard the words,

1:34:05.552 --> 1:34:06.641
good job, son.

1:34:08.120 --> 1:34:10.296
I miss you, son.

1:34:10.383 --> 1:34:11.471
You're a good son.

1:34:14.649 --> 1:34:16.259
I couldn't say the word dad.

1:34:19.392 --> 1:34:20.829
I just want to
tell you I love you

1:34:20.916 --> 1:34:23.527
because I feel like I didn't
get to tell you enough.

1:34:26.661 --> 1:34:28.663
I feel like God took
you away from me.

1:34:31.883 --> 1:34:34.146
I feel like a piece
of my heart is missing

1:34:34.233 --> 1:34:36.148
and I'm never going
to get it back.

1:35:05.917 --> 1:35:07.310
All right, well,

1:35:08.703 --> 1:35:10.269
get home safe, okay?

1:35:37.732 --> 1:35:38.863
- Yeah, this one's cute.

1:35:38.950 --> 1:35:41.257
- Mhm, I like her shoes.

1:35:41.344 --> 1:35:42.737
- Yeah.

1:35:42.824 --> 1:35:44.913
- Hey, who
want's to play a game?

1:35:45.000 --> 1:35:45.696
- Me!

1:35:45.783 --> 1:35:46.566
- You both do?

1:35:48.307 --> 1:35:49.265
Okay.

1:35:49.352 --> 1:35:51.180
Ana, you're first.

1:35:51.267 --> 1:35:52.529
What's it say?

1:35:52.616 --> 1:35:54.792
- I am soft and
I help you sleep.

1:35:55.706 --> 1:35:57.577
- That's a tough one.

1:35:57.664 --> 1:36:00.058
- What do you think would
help mom and dad sleep?

1:36:00.972 --> 1:36:01.930
- A blanket?

1:36:03.496 --> 1:36:05.455
- Where do you keep blankets?

1:36:05.542 --> 1:36:06.325
- The bedroom.

1:36:09.372 --> 1:36:10.677
- I have one for you too.

1:36:22.994 --> 1:36:23.778
- Daddy, I found it.

1:36:23.865 --> 1:36:24.779
It was under the pillow.

1:36:24.866 --> 1:36:25.867
- You did, what did you get?

1:36:25.954 --> 1:36:26.868
- A princess crown.

1:36:26.955 --> 1:36:29.566
- Wow, what a beautiful crown.

1:36:29.653 --> 1:36:31.873
Beautiful crown for
a beautiful princess.

1:36:34.484 --> 1:36:35.485
I got a clue too.

1:36:35.572 --> 1:36:36.965
- What is it?

1:36:37.052 --> 1:36:39.706
- Something waits for
you in a safe place.

1:36:39.794 --> 1:36:40.751
What do you think?

1:36:40.838 --> 1:36:41.665
- I don't know.

1:36:41.752 --> 1:36:43.145
- Could it be in the safe?

1:36:43.232 --> 1:36:44.494
- Maybe!

1:36:44.581 --> 1:36:45.625
- Only one way to
find out, right?

1:36:56.201 --> 1:36:58.290
- What'd you get?

1:36:58.377 --> 1:36:59.291
What'd you get, what'd you get,

1:36:59.378 --> 1:37:00.423
what'd you get?

1:37:02.077 --> 1:37:03.600
What'd you get?

1:37:03.687 --> 1:37:04.514
What'd you get, what'd you get,

1:37:04.601 --> 1:37:05.689
what'd you get?

1:37:16.656 --> 1:37:17.701
We're having another baby?

1:37:17.788 --> 1:37:19.268
- We're having a baby.

1:37:19.355 --> 1:37:20.791
- We're having a baby?
- We're having a baby.

1:37:20.878 --> 1:37:23.533
- We're having a baby,
we're having a baby!

1:37:23.620 --> 1:37:26.057
Oh, we're having a baby.

1:37:27.972 --> 1:37:28.799
Wow!

1:37:29.931 --> 1:37:31.628
You'll need to
learn how to share.

1:37:33.673 --> 1:37:34.457
Yeah, you too.

1:37:38.809 --> 1:37:42.595
- Come on now, let's take
a group family picture.

1:37:42.682 --> 1:37:43.858
Okay sweetie?

1:37:45.076 --> 1:37:47.687
Let's get your hair,
grandma likes your hair.

1:37:47.774 --> 1:37:49.820
- You're so beautiful,
you know that?

1:37:51.082 --> 1:37:53.432
You're the best thing
that ever happened to me.

1:37:54.694 --> 1:37:56.435
We had faith, you held on.

1:37:59.047 --> 1:38:01.179
I love you, you're my heart.

1:38:04.052 --> 1:38:06.619
- I'm just so happy
to have you back.

1:38:07.882 --> 1:38:08.752
I love you.

1:38:13.278 --> 1:38:14.932
- Ana, get over here.

1:38:16.978 --> 1:38:18.805
All righty, come on.

1:38:20.503 --> 1:38:23.071
- All right, make it a good one.

1:38:23.898 --> 1:38:26.161
All right guys, say cheese.

1:38:26.248 --> 1:38:26.988
