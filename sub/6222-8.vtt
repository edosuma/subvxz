00:01.585 --> 00:05.089
DRAGON: /In a land of myth
and a time of magic,

00:05.173 --> 00:09.677
the destiny of a great kingdom rests
on the shoulders of a young boy.

00:10.303 --> 00:12.889
His name, Merlin.

01:24.961 --> 01:28.172
-What's he actually doing?
-Thinking.

01:29.173 --> 01:30.216
About?

01:32.260 --> 01:33.386
You.

01:33.552 --> 01:35.221
(MERLIN GRUNTING)

01:39.600 --> 01:41.227
He has to decide upon a quest.

01:42.353 --> 01:44.021
Crouching on his knees
all night is going to help?

01:44.105 --> 01:45.231
Yes.

01:45.314 --> 01:49.568
He has to transcend his body so that the
quest is revealed to him in a vision.

01:50.861 --> 01:51.946
And you're going to stay here and watch?

01:52.029 --> 01:53.281
Gwen!

01:53.864 --> 01:56.033
This is one of the most important
days in a prince's life.

01:59.328 --> 02:01.372
(SNORING)

02:04.709 --> 02:05.918
(CLEARS THROAT)

02:13.384 --> 02:14.427
UTHER: It is time.

02:24.729 --> 02:27.273
What is the quest you have chosen?

02:29.317 --> 02:30.693
| can see but one path, sire.

02:34.196 --> 02:36.741
| am to enter the realm of
the Fisher King,

02:37.575 --> 02:39.076
and find the Golden Trident.

02:40.202 --> 02:43.414
Spoken of in the legends
of the Fallen Kings.

02:44.165 --> 02:47.626
You do understand that if you are to
prove yourself worthy of the throne,

02:47.710 --> 02:50.921
then you must complete this task, alone?

02:51.213 --> 02:52.256
And unaided?

02:57.053 --> 02:58.179
| do.

03:36.133 --> 03:37.635
You'll get hiccups.

03:39.845 --> 03:41.389
Who's the Fisher King?

03:41.472 --> 03:44.433
He was a sorcerer who lived
many hundreds of years ago.

03:46.727 --> 03:47.770
And?

03:48.938 --> 03:51.649
Legend has it that he was
wounded in battle.

03:51.732 --> 03:53.192
The wound festered.

03:53.275 --> 03:55.736
And the infection spread,
not just through his body,

03:55.820 --> 03:57.822
but through his lands as well.

03:58.489 --> 04:01.534
His mighty kingdom was reduced
to a wasteland.

04:01.617 --> 04:04.078
And has remained that way
to this very day.

04:04.161 --> 04:06.288
| don't understand,
why is Uther so worried?

04:06.956 --> 04:09.834
Some believe that the Fisher King
is still alive.

04:11.001 --> 04:12.711
Kept from death by his magic.

04:14.255 --> 04:16.882
-Do you?
-Perhaps.

04:17.341 --> 04:19.510
Perhaps not.
But the people of the North,

04:19.844 --> 04:22.680
call the area, the Perilous Lands.

04:23.639 --> 04:26.267
Few who have ever ventured there
have lived to tell the tale.

(MERLIN HICUPPING)

04:42.241 --> 04:43.826
-Merlin.
-I can't help it.

04:43.909 --> 04:45.202
| need to concentrate.

04:56.046 --> 04:57.173
(MERLIN HICUPPING)

04:59.216 --> 05:02.595
(SLOWLY) I am trying to prepare

05:02.678 --> 05:06.932
for one of the most important
moments in my life.

05:11.979 --> 05:13.731
What are these maps?

05:15.566 --> 05:18.486
None of them are the same.

05:18.569 --> 05:20.738
-Well done, Merlin. Do you know why?
-No.

05:22.364 --> 05:24.241
Because hardly anyone's ever been there.

05:24.575 --> 05:26.952
Couldn't you have chosen something
a bit easier?

05:27.786 --> 05:29.830
I'm meant to be proving my worth
to the people.

05:29.914 --> 05:31.081
A quick trip to the Lower Town

05:31.165 --> 05:33.334
to collect a bundle of herbs
probably won't cut it.

05:33.417 --> 05:36.587
But the Perilous Lands are perilous.

05:39.131 --> 05:41.842
Maybe I should come with you?

05:43.135 --> 05:44.845
-What for?
-To

05:45.971 --> 05:47.806
-help out.
-You

05:48.641 --> 05:50.559
really don't get it, do you?

05:50.643 --> 05:54.230
The task must be completed alone,

05:54.897 --> 05:56.440
and unaided.

05:56.941 --> 05:58.526
That's the way it's been
for hundreds of years,

05:58.609 --> 05:59.944
it's not about to change for you.

06:00.069 --> 06:02.863
Now, if you don't mind,

06:02.947 --> 06:05.115
I've some important preparation to do.

06:11.330 --> 06:12.873
(MERLIN HICUPPING)

06:21.799 --> 06:24.134
Please, please.

06:24.218 --> 06:27.513
Just spare me a few minutes
of your time, sister.

06:39.984 --> 06:41.193
My lady?

06:41.277 --> 06:42.570
It's all right, Gwen,
| won't be a moment.

06:50.244 --> 06:53.455
| must be quick, sister.
This enchantment won't hold for long.

06:53.539 --> 06:57.418
Tell me, what has Arthur chosen as
his quest?

06:57.501 --> 07:00.087
He sets out tomorrow for
the Perilous Lands.

07:00.170 --> 07:01.463
How perfect.

07:04.216 --> 07:08.637
Present this to the Prince
as a token of your good wishes.

07:08.721 --> 07:10.347
When the time is right,

07:10.431 --> 07:12.099
you must make a likeness of the Prince

07:12.182 --> 07:15.477
and bind it to the gift using the skills
that I taught you.

07:16.478 --> 07:18.230
When he does not return,

07:18.314 --> 07:21.150
you, sister,
will take your rightful place

07:21.233 --> 07:24.695
as sole heir to the throne of Camelot.

07:46.675 --> 07:47.760
(GASPING)

07:56.977 --> 07:58.937
My lady, are you all right?

07:59.772 --> 08:01.231
Why wouldn't I be?

08:01.857 --> 08:04.777
|... I thought...

08:05.486 --> 08:07.988
That poor woman didn't have a penny
to feed her family,

08:08.447 --> 08:10.282
| felt duty bound to help her, Gwen.

08:27.508 --> 08:30.094
- I know you have to go but...
-I'll be careful.

08:32.136 --> 08:33.179
For me.

09:08.465 --> 09:09.633
You look troubled, sire.

09:09.717 --> 09:11.719
He's the sole heir
to the throne, Morgana.

09:15.264 --> 09:16.306
Don't worry.

09:17.349 --> 09:20.644
I'm certain a Pendragon will rule over
Camelot for a long time to come.

09:40.831 --> 09:41.832
Beautiful, isn't it?

09:42.916 --> 09:44.293
It was a gift from Morgana.

10:01.894 --> 10:03.687
You sure it wasn't a jewel?

10:04.480 --> 10:06.023
No, brighter than that.

10:06.732 --> 10:08.400
You think it was enchanted?

10:08.525 --> 10:10.152
There was magic there, I could feel it.

10:10.235 --> 10:11.361
You sure?

10:12.196 --> 10:14.615
Well, if it came from Morgana,
it can only mean one thing.

10:17.201 --> 10:18.243
Arthur's in danger.

10:39.223 --> 10:41.058
I'm not sure I know
where else to look, Merlin.

10:41.141 --> 10:42.559
Has to be something.

10:42.684 --> 10:45.521
We've seen every stone imaginable.

10:46.897 --> 10:47.940
Unless...

11:00.369 --> 11:02.996
-Merlin?
-Gaius, that's it.

11:03.080 --> 11:06.250
That is not a stone, Merlin.
It's an eye of the phoenix.

11:06.333 --> 11:08.377
-Phoenix?
-Some call it the fire bird.

11:08.460 --> 11:10.504
Its eye burned with a fire

11:10.587 --> 11:14.508
that consumes the life-force
of anybody it comes in contact with.

11:14.591 --> 11:17.344
-Arthur!
-The eye will draw energy from him.

11:17.427 --> 11:20.097
If it's worn for too long,
Arthur will die.

11:20.180 --> 11:21.223
| have to go after him.

11:21.306 --> 11:24.142
This is not a task to be undertaken
lightly, Merlin.

11:24.226 --> 11:25.435
You'll need help.

12:30.500 --> 12:31.501
(DOOR OPENING)

12:33.503 --> 12:34.630
What is it now?

12:35.464 --> 12:36.924
| just wanted to see if there
was anything you needed.

12:37.007 --> 12:38.050
No, get out.

12:38.592 --> 12:41.011
-Is something burning?
- Isaid, get out!

13:59.089 --> 14:00.257
(MEN FIGHTING)

Hello, Gwaine.

14:11.226 --> 14:13.353
Oh, Merlin.

14:14.187 --> 14:17.274
-How are you?
-Give me my money.

14:39.921 --> 14:40.964
Gwaine?

14:42.799 --> 14:43.842
GWAINE: Run!

14:55.520 --> 14:58.398
Remind me again, what you're doing here.

14:58.482 --> 15:00.358
Arthur's in trouble, I need your help.

15:00.442 --> 15:02.027
-What kind of trouble?
-There.

15:04.988 --> 15:06.364
MERLIN: He's gone to the Perilous Lands.

15:06.490 --> 15:08.784
-You're serious?
-Yeah.

15:13.246 --> 15:15.665
Because now, it sound pretty attractive.

15:18.001 --> 15:22.130
-All right. Go for the horses.
-You have got to be joking.

15:48.365 --> 15:50.117
(SHOUTING)

15:50.200 --> 15:52.077
(BOTH LAUGHING)

16:25.402 --> 16:28.029
Who is it that wishes
to cross my bridge?

16:28.113 --> 16:29.239
A knight.

16:30.448 --> 16:32.492
On a quest to find the Trident
of the Fisher King.

16:34.661 --> 16:35.912
Then you must be Courage.

16:38.081 --> 16:41.084
No, I'm Prince Arthur of Camelot.

16:46.798 --> 16:48.425
I'm Grettir.

16:51.303 --> 16:53.763
| have to say, you're not as short
as I'd thought you'd be.

16:58.768 --> 17:02.230
Before I let you pass,
I'll give you a little advice.

17:02.772 --> 17:04.816
Besides courage there are
two more things you'll need

17:04.900 --> 17:06.193
to complete your quest.

17:06.358 --> 17:08.694
Strength and magic.

17:09.738 --> 17:11.156
| don't condone the use of magic.

17:11.239 --> 17:13.325
You'll be wise not to dismiss it
so freely.

17:14.034 --> 17:15.492
The rules in the land
that you're heading to

17:15.577 --> 17:18.121
are quite different to those
in the world that you know.

17:23.792 --> 17:24.877
Thank you for your help.

17:35.013 --> 17:37.057
It's a very beautiful bracelet.

17:37.140 --> 17:39.351
It was a gift from someone
very dear to me.

17:40.143 --> 17:41.811
She hoped it would bring me
good fortune.

17:43.146 --> 17:44.814
Did she now?

17:49.110 --> 17:50.820
How very thoughtful of her.

18:13.843 --> 18:16.096
MERLIN: Why were those men so angry?

18:16.179 --> 18:18.181
GWAINE: It's always the way in gambling.

18:18.265 --> 18:21.268
You make a man a fool,
he calls you a thief.

18:22.811 --> 18:23.853
How'd you find me?

18:23.937 --> 18:26.398
It wasn't easy. I've been in almost
every tavern in Angard.

18:27.524 --> 18:28.692
So have I.

18:29.734 --> 18:30.819
(BOTH LAUGHING)

18:49.754 --> 18:51.840
-You're so good to me, Gwen.
-Thank you.

18:52.841 --> 18:53.883
It's nothing.

18:55.051 --> 18:56.094
You're upset with me.

18:57.762 --> 18:59.639
| know, I shouted at you last night.

19:04.561 --> 19:05.562
I'm sorry.

19:07.147 --> 19:09.607
-What can I do to make it up?
-It's forgotten.

19:11.318 --> 19:13.236
Why don't I give you some time off?

19:15.947 --> 19:19.117
Don't look at me like that. I'm sure
| can look after myself for one night.

19:19.284 --> 19:21.494
That's very kind of you, my lady.

19:22.912 --> 19:24.289
Glad we're friends again.

19:27.292 --> 19:30.086
Before I go, I'll make sure everything's
ready for your return.

19:31.087 --> 19:32.130
That's sweet.

19:33.423 --> 19:34.507
Don't stay too late.

19:45.060 --> 19:46.102
This is it.

19:46.811 --> 19:49.105
On the other side of the forest
lie the Perilous Lands.

19:49.189 --> 19:51.441
-It doesn't look friendly.
-That's because it's not.

19:52.776 --> 19:54.861
-What do you mean?
-It's wretched.

19:54.944 --> 19:56.905
How do you know?
You've never been there.

19:56.988 --> 19:58.948
I've traveled to many places, Merlin.

19:59.032 --> 20:00.825
Not the Perilous Lands,
I'd have heard that.

20:01.451 --> 20:03.286
-Why!
-There aren't any taverns.

20:04.829 --> 20:06.539
| told you it was wretched.

20:13.004 --> 20:14.047
Gwen?

21:08.685 --> 21:10.520
(GASPING)

22:19.714 --> 22:23.092
So, Magic has arrived.

22:24.594 --> 22:27.514
-What?
-There's nothing to be afraid of.

22:27.597 --> 22:31.351
Your presence is essential if
Arthur is to succeed on his quest.

22:31.434 --> 22:33.353
How do you know about Arthur?
Who are you?

22:33.436 --> 22:35.355
The keeper of the bridge.

22:35.438 --> 22:37.482
| only wish to see
the Fisher King's lands restored

22:37.607 --> 22:39.442
and prosperity reign again.

22:39.734 --> 22:41.569
Till your mission is complete,
this cannot happen.

22:42.529 --> 22:45.615
-It's not my mission, it's Arthur's.
-If that's what you choose to believe.

22:46.366 --> 22:50.286
It's no accident that Arthur chose this
path or you chose to follow him.

22:50.495 --> 22:52.872
Ah, finally.

22:52.956 --> 22:55.041
Strength has arrived.
The trio is complete.

22:55.124 --> 22:56.459
Who's he?

23:00.255 --> 23:01.839
| mean no harm to either of you.

23:01.923 --> 23:03.967
And I'd thank you to mean
no harm in return.

23:04.801 --> 23:06.135
Where's my sword?

23:06.219 --> 23:08.137
It will return to you
once you reach the other side.

23:14.727 --> 23:17.355
The Fisher King has waited many years
for this day,

23:17.564 --> 23:19.357
do not deny him what he wishes.

23:22.068 --> 23:25.321
Remember, nothing is as it seems.

24:10.867 --> 24:12.994
(PANTING)

24:21.753 --> 24:25.965
(DISTANT SCREECHING)

24:27.008 --> 24:28.051
What was that?

24:29.761 --> 24:31.137
A pheasant.

24:32.889 --> 24:35.183
-A pheasant?
-A very big one.

24:40.897 --> 24:42.899
You can turn back if you want to.

24:45.151 --> 24:46.778
I'm not scared of pheasants.

24:48.154 --> 24:50.948
| don't know.
Why do you want to do this?

24:52.492 --> 24:53.534
Same reason as you.

24:55.578 --> 24:56.579
Help a friend.

25:00.541 --> 25:02.335
Arthur's lucky to have us.

25:03.711 --> 25:04.754
Hail Arthur.

25:10.301 --> 25:13.680
-He'd do the same for you.
-Well, I hope so.

25:15.056 --> 25:16.265
You're the only friend I've got.

25:19.352 --> 25:20.520
I'm not surprised.

25:23.272 --> 25:25.775
(DISTANT SCREECHING)

25:27.193 --> 25:30.113
That sounds like three pheasants,
at least.

25:32.490 --> 25:34.242
(BANGING AT DOOR)

25:36.786 --> 25:39.163
-I'm sorry to wake you.
-Don't be silly.

25:39.247 --> 25:42.083
-I'm not sure who else I can talk to.
-What is it, child?

25:42.917 --> 25:45.378
-It's Morgana.
-What's happened?

25:45.461 --> 25:47.672
She had a box and

25:47.755 --> 25:49.799
her eyes were like they were on fire.

25:50.925 --> 25:53.469
What do I do, Gaius? She's using magic.

25:53.970 --> 25:55.805
Everything may not be as it seems, Gwen.

25:55.888 --> 25:57.640
No, no, I know what I saw.

25:58.725 --> 26:01.644
I've known Morgana for so long.
| don't want to believe this.

26:02.854 --> 26:04.731
She isn't the person I knew.

26:04.814 --> 26:06.482
She changed, Gaius.

26:07.775 --> 26:10.737
| don't think she means well
to any of us anymore.

26:12.196 --> 26:14.532
| wish I could say otherwise.

26:15.158 --> 26:16.826
But I fear you're right.

27:54.632 --> 27:55.842
There it is.

27:57.760 --> 27:58.886
What's that in the sky?

28:00.805 --> 28:04.141
They're not birds.
I've never seen creatures like that.

28:05.601 --> 28:07.270
It's like they're hunting something.

28:10.356 --> 28:12.775
-What was that?
-Sword.

28:13.693 --> 28:14.777
It's Arthur.

28:19.991 --> 28:21.868
(WYVERNS SCREECHING)

29:19.592 --> 29:21.093
| should've known.

29:21.177 --> 29:23.137
-What are they?
-Wyverns.

29:23.220 --> 29:25.139
Distant cousins of the dragon.

29:25.222 --> 29:28.017
They're creatures of magic.
So be careful.

29:50.706 --> 29:51.707
Let's split up.

30:22.571 --> 30:23.572
Arthur?

30:28.744 --> 30:29.954
Arthur?

(SPEAKING IN DRAGON LANGUAGE)

31:52.244 --> 31:54.663
What the hell are you doing here?

31:54.747 --> 31:56.665
Why can you never just say, thanks?

31:56.749 --> 31:59.960
Thanks? What?
For completely ruining the quest?

32:00.044 --> 32:02.880
Well, it's a good job that I was here
otherwise you'd be wyvern fodder by now.

32:02.963 --> 32:06.884
How many times do I have to get it
into your thick skull?

32:06.967 --> 32:09.678

32:11.180 --> 32:13.099
(WYVERNS SCREECHING)

32:21.607 --> 32:22.650
Great.

32:23.651 --> 32:26.737
This just gets better and better.
Are Gwen and Morgana here, too?

32:28.322 --> 32:30.282
We're going to have a surprise party?

32:30.366 --> 32:33.494
There are more wyverns on the way.
We need to get out of here.

32:33.661 --> 32:35.704
I'm not leaving without the Trident.

32:36.372 --> 32:38.207
That was the whole point of this quest.

32:41.544 --> 32:43.170
Do you want us to help you?

32:44.004 --> 32:46.799
-Or do you want to do this alone?
-Merlin!

32:50.886 --> 32:52.304
MERLIN: Do you know
where the Trident is?

32:52.388 --> 32:55.516
If I did, there wouldn't be a problem,
would there?

32:56.016 --> 32:57.726
Any clues you can give us?

32:58.144 --> 33:00.646
This is a quest, Merlin,
not a treasure hunt.

33:00.729 --> 33:02.481
-Ah, it is sort of...
-Merlin!

33:18.998 --> 33:20.207
Look at this.

33:22.835 --> 33:24.420
Looks like a throne room.

33:26.672 --> 33:28.799
If the trident's going to be anywhere...

33:39.476 --> 33:43.439
-You all right?
-Gwaine? Arthur?

33:46.066 --> 33:47.902
There's got to be a way to open this.

34:06.754 --> 34:09.882
So, Emrys.

34:09.965 --> 34:13.135
You are here at last.

34:47.002 --> 34:49.088
So you are still alive.

34:50.965 --> 34:52.007
For now.

34:56.553 --> 35:00.766
Look, I'm sure if we just
reach in here...

35:07.940 --> 35:10.192
We will be able to find something
to release the door.

35:11.068 --> 35:14.196
Go on then, don't be such a princess.

35:52.901 --> 35:54.111
You want to die.

I've been waiting all these years

36:01.827 --> 36:04.413
for the arrival of a new time.

36:05.748 --> 36:09.293
The time of the once and future king.

36:12.171 --> 36:13.881

36:22.681 --> 36:25.851
And my time finally can come to an end.

36:29.563 --> 36:31.607
This is why you were brought here.

36:33.317 --> 36:35.444
Oh, this is not Arthur's quest,

36:36.862 --> 36:38.030
it is yours.

36:40.866 --> 36:44.119
Arthur thinks the prize is the Trident.

36:53.879 --> 36:55.464
The real prize

36:57.132 --> 36:59.551
is something far greater.

Albion's time of need is near.

37:35.671 --> 37:38.590
And in that dark hour,

Yeah, but it's fun trying.

that was a good quest.

sometimes, Merlin.

-Of course I was.
-You were not there.

in your spare time.

was to find out you weren't alone...

Yes, Merlin, so...

-Just keep your mouth shut.
-Absolutely, sire.
