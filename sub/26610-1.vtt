00:48.361 --> 00:50.663
- The Lord is my shepherd;

00:50.663 --> 00:52.565
I shall not want.

00:52.565 --> 00:55.702
He maketh me to lie down
in green pastures;

00:55.702 --> 00:58.471
He leadeth me beside
the still waters.

00:58.471 --> 01:00.406
He restoreth my soul;

01:00.406 --> 01:02.775
He leadeth me on the paths
of righteousness

01:02.775 --> 01:04.711
for His namesake.

01:04.711 --> 01:06.412
Though I walk through
the valley

01:06.412 --> 01:09.649
of the shadow of death,
I will fear no evil;

01:09.649 --> 01:11.818
for thou art with me;

01:11.818 --> 01:14.821
Thy rod and Thy staff,
they comfort me.

01:14.821 --> 01:17.090
Thou preparest
a table before me

01:17.090 --> 01:18.958
in the presence of my enemies.

01:18.958 --> 01:22.028
- We are live
at the Texas State Cemetery

01:22.028 --> 01:24.731
for the memorial service
of Blake Redding,

01:24.731 --> 01:26.866
son of Texas Governor
Dean Redding,

01:26.866 --> 01:29.135
who lost his life
when he failed

01:29.135 --> 01:30.903
his thinning exam last week

01:30.903 --> 01:32.872
at Vista Point High School.

01:33.906 --> 01:35.541
Reports have since indicated

01:35.541 --> 01:37.076
that Blake Redding
was not among

01:37.076 --> 01:39.045
the initial students
to fail the exam,

01:39.045 --> 01:40.780
which has shrouded
the Governor's campaign

01:40.780 --> 01:43.549
for president in
a flurry of controversy.

01:43.549 --> 01:44.951
- Thank you.

01:44.951 --> 01:47.053
- Governor, your thoughts
on the Vista Point scandal?

01:47.053 --> 01:48.488
- Not today.

01:48.488 --> 01:49.922
- Attending the service

01:49.922 --> 01:52.392
is former
Vista Point High School student

01:52.392 --> 01:53.659
Laina Michaels,

01:53.659 --> 01:55.595
who has become a public figure

01:55.595 --> 01:58.865
since she was wrongfully accused
of failing her exam

01:58.865 --> 02:02.535
and framed for committing
acts of domestic terrorism.

02:02.535 --> 02:04.170
- Laina, do you have any plans

02:04.170 --> 02:06.506
for taking legal action
against the Board of Education

02:06.506 --> 02:09.175
for mishandling
your test scores?

02:10.743 --> 02:12.512
- I don't know.

02:12.512 --> 02:14.747
- Do you hold Governor Redding
personally responsible

02:14.747 --> 02:17.116
for implicating you
as a domestic terrorist?

02:18.651 --> 02:20.019
- No comment.
all: Miss Michaels!

02:20.019 --> 02:21.754
- I hate to be all business,

02:21.754 --> 02:24.690
but the DPC has appointed
a special investigator

02:24.690 --> 02:26.025
for the Vista Point incident.

02:26.025 --> 02:27.927
- It's Agent Joanne Morris.

02:27.927 --> 02:29.595
<i> They didn't waste any time.</i>

02:29.595 --> 02:30.963
- Fortunately for you,
Mason King

02:30.963 --> 02:32.465
has signed an affidavit
absolving you

02:32.465 --> 02:34.667
of any connection to the events.

02:34.667 --> 02:36.636
<i> Per your request,
 he's been reassigned.</i>

02:36.636 --> 02:38.070
<i> - Good.
 Where is he?</i>

02:38.070 --> 02:39.505
- I'll handle this myself.

02:39.505 --> 02:40.907
You just focus
on what's important:

02:40.907 --> 02:42.975
getting elected.

02:48.815 --> 02:50.983
<i> - How close would you say
 you were to Blake Redding?</i>

02:52.652 --> 02:54.954
- I barely knew him.

02:54.954 --> 02:57.590
Talked to him a few times
over the years

02:57.590 --> 02:58.791
but that was it.

02:58.791 --> 03:01.627
- Was he your boyfriend?

03:01.627 --> 03:03.663
You guys have
a personal relationship?

03:03.663 --> 03:06.232
- He was with Ellie
until last year.

03:06.232 --> 03:09.535
Then he kept to himself.

03:09.535 --> 03:11.604
I barely knew him.

03:11.604 --> 03:12.805
- Barely knew him.

03:15.541 --> 03:18.211
You don't have to tell me about
some boy you had feelings for,

03:18.211 --> 03:20.513
but we need to be honest
with each other.

03:20.513 --> 03:22.782
Let's go over the timeline.

03:22.782 --> 03:24.250
An hour before the kiss,

03:24.250 --> 03:26.152
I have you on
the internal server computer.

03:26.152 --> 03:27.653
I need to know what you saw.

03:27.653 --> 03:29.555
- I was working fast.

03:29.555 --> 03:32.658
Everything I saw
was posted on the news.

03:32.658 --> 03:35.895
I knew they switched my test,
I was just trying to prove it.

03:35.895 --> 03:39.499
- Anything regarding the school
or sensitive material?

03:39.499 --> 03:41.868
- I really wish
I could help you.

03:44.504 --> 03:47.874
- Here's my card.

03:47.874 --> 03:49.775
If you remember anything

03:49.775 --> 03:52.011
or need someone you can trust,

03:52.011 --> 03:54.247
I just want you to know
you're not alone.

03:56.782 --> 03:59.819
- What's so funny?
- Joey's on TV.

03:59.819 --> 04:02.489
- No, guys, cut it out.

04:04.156 --> 04:06.526
- That's my cue.

04:06.526 --> 04:09.095
Take care of yourself, Laina.

04:13.232 --> 04:14.901
- Guys.

04:14.901 --> 04:18.870
I need you two to focus.
both: Okay.

04:21.040 --> 04:22.275
- No interviews.

04:22.275 --> 04:24.010
- Miss Michaels,

04:24.010 --> 04:26.879
it's Jack Prescott
with Governor Redding's team.

04:26.879 --> 04:28.180
- What does he want?

04:28.180 --> 04:29.982
- He needs to see you.

04:29.982 --> 04:32.184
It's about Blake.

04:36.822 --> 04:38.124
- Hi.

04:38.124 --> 04:40.793
- Hi.

04:40.793 --> 04:43.229
- You said something
about Blake?

04:44.897 --> 04:46.899
- I can't believe
I'm walking these floors.

04:46.899 --> 04:48.067
Two years ago, I put a picture

04:48.067 --> 04:49.602
of this place
on my vision board.

04:49.602 --> 04:50.803
Now I'm here.

04:50.803 --> 04:52.171
- Loving the new look, Wendy.

04:52.171 --> 04:53.806
Auburn?
- Rosewood.

04:53.806 --> 04:55.207
This is the bullpen.

04:55.207 --> 04:57.109
A lot of the junior staffers
get thrown here,

04:57.109 --> 04:58.811
but since I took a chance
getting the station

04:58.811 --> 05:00.813
to hire the first
non-intern under 20,

05:00.813 --> 05:02.048
you get your own office.

05:02.048 --> 05:04.317
Now we're talking.

05:04.317 --> 05:06.752
- This room used to be a closet.
Now it's yours.

05:06.752 --> 05:08.888
- In real estate terms,
they call this

05:08.888 --> 05:10.990
"cozy with potential."

05:12.625 --> 05:14.594
- There are still a lot
of questions that need answers

05:14.594 --> 05:16.162
about what happened
at Vista Point High.

05:16.162 --> 05:17.196
- I get it.

05:17.196 --> 05:19.165
You want me to dig deep
and uncover what's really

05:19.165 --> 05:20.833
going on at
Vista Point High, right?

05:20.833 --> 05:23.135
Question authorities,
make it clear that BNC News

05:23.135 --> 05:25.271
is gonna ask hard questions
and accept the blowback

05:25.271 --> 05:27.106
regardless of the consequences.

05:27.106 --> 05:28.274
- No.

05:28.274 --> 05:30.076
Kellan, this is your first day.

05:30.076 --> 05:32.979
You're starting at the bottom.
That's how this works.

05:32.979 --> 05:34.880
First up, a science piece.

05:34.880 --> 05:36.782
Parents want to know what
chemicals are being administered

05:36.782 --> 05:38.150
to the students who
go to the thinning.

05:38.150 --> 05:40.119
I'm gonna send you out
to do a prelim.

05:40.119 --> 05:41.320
- Uh, two things.

05:41.320 --> 05:43.022
Number one, what's a prelim?

05:43.022 --> 05:44.957
Number two,
when are you grabbing dinner?

05:44.957 --> 05:46.826
- Talk to people.
Find an angle.

05:46.826 --> 05:47.994
Set up interviews, chase leads.

05:47.994 --> 05:50.129
You do that, we'll get dinner.

05:50.129 --> 05:52.098
- It's a date.
- I'm married.

05:52.098 --> 05:54.000
Get to work.

05:58.371 --> 06:00.840
- Miss Michaels.

06:00.840 --> 06:03.943
It's so nice
to finally meet you.

06:03.943 --> 06:07.680
- You went on TV
and said I was a terrorist.

06:07.680 --> 06:10.816
- Right to the chase.
I love it.

06:14.320 --> 06:19.058
I was given misleading
information from my people.

06:19.058 --> 06:21.327
I want to apologize.

06:22.928 --> 06:25.765
- You didn't call me in here
to apologize.

06:25.765 --> 06:27.700
- I wanted to offer you
an advisory role

06:27.700 --> 06:31.337
on our new
Thinning Oversight Committee.

06:31.337 --> 06:33.105
- No thanks.

06:33.105 --> 06:35.975
- The thinning isn't perfect,
but it's the law.

06:35.975 --> 06:37.410
And with this recent incident,

06:37.410 --> 06:39.412
there's been strong
headwinds against it.

06:39.412 --> 06:42.415
People want to see
the other side of the story.

06:42.415 --> 06:45.384
- You want me
to stump for you.

06:45.384 --> 06:46.886
- It'd be a very
generous paycheck

06:46.886 --> 06:48.754
for you and your siblings,

06:48.754 --> 06:52.391
take care of you
for quite some time.

06:52.391 --> 06:54.393
- Thanks for the water.

06:57.096 --> 06:59.865
Hi, guys.
Let's go.

07:05.104 --> 07:07.373
- Laina.
Georgina Preston.

07:07.373 --> 07:11.143
Oh, this must be your family.

07:11.143 --> 07:14.780
I hear you will be taking
your first test this year.

07:14.780 --> 07:18.484
How exciting.

07:18.484 --> 07:21.220
Corrine has 11 more years
of testing.

07:21.220 --> 07:25.091
I'd imagine it would be nice
to have a little...

07:25.091 --> 07:26.192
support.

07:30.262 --> 07:32.331
Jack will take you home.

07:46.846 --> 07:52.752
- Excuse me?
You just passed our house.

07:53.919 --> 07:56.355
- Laina?

07:59.191 --> 08:00.760
- Help!

08:20.312 --> 08:22.381
Who are you?
Where are Corrine and Joey?

08:22.381 --> 08:24.016
- They're safe.

08:24.016 --> 08:26.252
Everything is okay.

08:26.252 --> 08:27.987
See?

08:34.460 --> 08:35.494
- Miss Cole?

08:35.494 --> 08:38.097
all: Morning, Miss Cole.

08:38.097 --> 08:39.799
- Maggie.

08:39.799 --> 08:41.033
I'm sorry for the scare.

08:41.033 --> 08:44.035
This is kind of
a sensitive operation.

08:44.035 --> 08:45.938
- Tell the Governor
I'm not working for him.

08:45.938 --> 08:48.808
- We're not with the Governor.

08:48.808 --> 08:50.142
We're with The Fight.

08:50.142 --> 08:51.544
<i> - We're hiding in plain sight</i>

08:51.544 --> 08:53.145
<i> at all levels of government</i>

08:53.145 --> 08:55.848
to garner influence
to end the thinning,

08:55.848 --> 08:58.050
and transport at-risk students
to safe houses.

08:58.050 --> 08:59.852
- You can get people out?

08:59.852 --> 09:01.287
- That's what we do.

09:01.287 --> 09:03.222
Mister Leonard over there
has personally escorted

09:03.222 --> 09:06.258
over 100 students
across the border

09:06.258 --> 09:08.260
to a secure island
off the Gulf.

09:08.260 --> 09:10.095
- Corrine and Joey--
you have to get them out.

09:10.095 --> 09:12.198
- That's why we need you
to help the Governor.

09:12.198 --> 09:13.966
- No.

09:13.966 --> 09:17.102
I'm not going to be
a mouthpiece for the thinning.

09:17.102 --> 09:18.270
If you won't help me
get them out,

09:18.270 --> 09:20.139
then I'm going to do it myself.

09:20.139 --> 09:22.141
- You know what happens
when they catch a runaway?

09:22.141 --> 09:23.509
The kids get split up.

09:23.509 --> 09:25.144
<i> They bounce around
 in state homes.</i>

09:25.144 --> 09:26.512
<i> They get
 a third-rate education</i>

09:26.512 --> 09:28.480
and a guaranteed trip
to the thinning.

09:28.480 --> 09:30.249
You don't want that.

09:30.249 --> 09:32.251
- With the right candidate
in place,

09:32.251 --> 09:34.353
we can do a full repeal
of the thinning,

09:34.353 --> 09:37.957
and find a more humane way
to combat our population crisis.

09:37.957 --> 09:39.959
- But if Redding
becomes president,

09:39.959 --> 09:41.493
the thinning will stay strong

09:41.493 --> 09:45.064
and continue to send
innocent kids to die.

09:45.064 --> 09:47.199
And that could just be
the tip of the iceberg.

09:49.001 --> 09:51.003
- What does Georgina have
to do with all this?

09:51.003 --> 09:52.271
- We don't know.

09:52.271 --> 09:53.472
That's what
we need you to find out.

09:53.472 --> 09:55.207
If she has her way,

09:55.207 --> 09:57.409
when Governor Redding
becomes President Redding,

09:57.409 --> 10:00.145
we lose our window
to stop the thinning.

10:00.145 --> 10:03.082
I mean, who knows
what the future could hold.

10:07.586 --> 10:10.489
- So, uh, you worked the day
Blake's body was being prepared?

10:10.489 --> 10:12.091
- Yes, I was on-site.

10:12.091 --> 10:13.926
- And did you handle the body?

10:13.926 --> 10:16.262
- Not personally, no.

10:21.100 --> 10:22.501
- Kellan,
it's 3:00 in the morning.

10:22.501 --> 10:25.104
- I know.
Um, weird question.

10:25.104 --> 10:27.239
Do you own a shovel?

10:27.239 --> 10:30.376
And out of all nine employees
who worked that 72-hour period,

10:30.376 --> 10:33.512
not one person ever
saw or handled the body.

10:33.512 --> 10:35.247
- That's crazy.

10:35.247 --> 10:37.549
- No.
We're crazy.

10:39.518 --> 10:41.954
Okay--oh.

10:41.954 --> 10:43.289
Hey.

10:43.289 --> 10:45.557
Are you good?
- Yeah.

10:45.557 --> 10:47.360
- Be careful.

10:49.061 --> 10:50.296
Wait.

10:50.296 --> 10:52.031
No.

10:57.102 --> 10:58.537
Yeah.

10:58.537 --> 11:01.374
Are we doing this?

11:05.077 --> 11:07.179
- Here.

11:11.383 --> 11:12.618
I can't believe
you're doing all this for a guy

11:12.618 --> 11:14.987
that doesn't even
know your name.

11:14.987 --> 11:17.289
- Light.
- Yeah, sorry.

12:03.102 --> 12:04.570
- Congratulations.

12:04.570 --> 12:07.306
Your class has been spared.

12:07.306 --> 12:10.609
<i> Every single one of you
 was chosen by our system</i>

12:10.609 --> 12:12.678
<i> and deemed worthy to receive</i>

12:12.678 --> 12:15.214
<i> a second chance at life.</i>

12:15.214 --> 12:18.150
<i> I realize you may have
 a couple of questions.</i>

12:18.150 --> 12:20.486
<i> Okay, let's begin.</i>

12:20.486 --> 12:24.089
<i> Our first, most commonly-asked
 question is:</i>

12:24.089 --> 12:26.291
<i> "Am I dead?"</i>

12:26.291 --> 12:28.394
<i> No.
 You're not dead.</i>

12:28.394 --> 12:30.496
<i> Question two:</i>

12:30.496 --> 12:32.197
<i> "Where am I?"</i>

12:32.197 --> 12:35.734
Well, you're in The Incubator,

12:35.734 --> 12:38.303
a special facility
designed and sponsored

12:38.303 --> 12:41.573
by the great minds
at Assuru Global.

12:41.573 --> 12:43.275
<i> We are here
 to help you grow</i>

12:43.275 --> 12:45.711
from a parasitic leech
on our society

12:45.711 --> 12:49.081
to a productive member
of the working class.

12:49.081 --> 12:52.484
<i> I know what you're thinking:
 "Why me?"</i>

12:52.484 --> 12:54.820
<i> Using our patented algorithm,</i>

12:54.820 --> 12:57.156
<i> we analyzed the test scores
 of this year's</i>

12:57.156 --> 12:59.058
<i> failing students
 and determined that</i>

12:59.058 --> 13:01.126
<i> you still have
 value and special skills</i>

13:01.126 --> 13:03.395
<i> that can be utilized
 to better America.</i>

13:03.395 --> 13:06.131
Sorry, that was a lot of words.

13:06.131 --> 13:08.700
To put it simply:
you were chosen, silly.

13:10.102 --> 13:11.837
<i> Last question:</i>

13:11.837 --> 13:14.673
"Do I get to go back?"

13:14.673 --> 13:17.543
The most productive members
of the Incubator program

13:17.543 --> 13:20.612
will be considered
for reintroduction to society.

13:20.612 --> 13:23.582
<i> Again, congratulations
 on being selected</i>

13:23.582 --> 13:26.151
<i> and getting to begin
 your new life.</i>

13:26.151 --> 13:28.087
<i> Be worthy.</i>

13:35.194 --> 13:39.198
- We made it!
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

13:39.198 --> 13:42.201
<i> - Please proceed
 to the assignment room.</i>

13:51.310 --> 13:52.711
<i> - Heather Forester, you have</i>

13:52.711 --> 13:54.546
<i> been assigned to "Assembly."</i>

13:54.546 --> 13:57.483
<i> Please proceed to
 the door labeled "Assembly."</i>

13:57.483 --> 13:59.585
<i> Today you will be
 observing only.</i>

14:02.521 --> 14:04.356
<i> Ned Walker.</i>

14:04.356 --> 14:07.359
<i> You have been assigned
 to "Advanced Systems."</i>

14:16.201 --> 14:17.636
<i> Blake Redding.</i>

14:17.636 --> 14:20.405
<i> You have been assigned
 to "Packaging."</i>

14:20.405 --> 14:22.207
- What happens if I say no?

14:27.379 --> 14:31.483
<i> - Please proceed to the door
 labeled "Packaging."</i>

14:31.483 --> 14:34.453
<i> Today you will be
 observing only.</i>

14:37.189 --> 14:38.790
<i> As a member
 of the Incubator,</i>

14:38.790 --> 14:41.360
<i> your day breaks down
 into three sections:</i>

14:41.360 --> 14:43.562
<i> work, eat, and sleep.</i>

14:45.364 --> 14:47.900
<i> During work hours,
 each member will report to</i>

14:47.900 --> 14:49.434
<i> their assigned section</i>

14:49.434 --> 14:52.204
<i> for 14 hours of labor.</i>

14:52.204 --> 14:54.540
<i> Then, each member
 will be released</i>

14:54.540 --> 14:57.643
<i> to have one hour of
 dining and personal time.</i>

14:57.643 --> 15:00.245
<i> At curfew,
 each member must return</i>

15:00.245 --> 15:03.348
<i> to their domiciles
 for rest and recuperation.</i>

15:09.388 --> 15:12.491
<i> Please proceed to the
 factory floor for observation.</i>

15:13.725 --> 15:16.328
<i> Please proceed to the...</i>
- Ellie.

15:23.268 --> 15:24.536
<i> - All workers please return</i>

15:24.536 --> 15:26.572
<i> to living and dining quarters.</i>

15:26.572 --> 15:28.407
<i> All workers please return</i>

15:28.407 --> 15:30.676
<i> to living and dining quarters.</i>

15:30.676 --> 15:33.812
<i> All workers please return
 to living and dining quarters.</i>

15:33.812 --> 15:36.315
<i> Remember: be worthy.</i>

15:46.592 --> 15:48.594
- Ellie!

15:51.897 --> 15:54.366
Ellie!

15:54.366 --> 15:56.302
Ellie!

16:15.988 --> 16:18.490
You're alive.

16:18.490 --> 16:19.691
- I am alive.

16:21.860 --> 16:25.530
- I thought I was
seeing things.

16:25.530 --> 16:27.633
Where are we?

16:27.633 --> 16:30.335
- They didn't tell you?

16:30.335 --> 16:34.473
We were chosen.

16:34.473 --> 16:37.243
- I never thought
I'd see you again.

16:40.579 --> 16:42.848
- No.

16:42.848 --> 16:44.850
Not here.

16:44.850 --> 16:47.686
We have a curfew in an hour.

17:00.866 --> 17:02.668
- Ellie, I love you.

17:02.668 --> 17:04.935
- I can't believe
it's been a year.

17:07.806 --> 17:10.909
I don't know how
I'd live without you.

17:12.411 --> 17:14.380
- I missed you so much.

17:25.624 --> 17:28.527
- It's crazy that
we're still alive.

17:28.527 --> 17:30.028
I thought it was all over.

17:30.028 --> 17:31.963
- When they put
that needle into my neck,

17:31.963 --> 17:34.700
I really thought that
that was it.

17:34.700 --> 17:36.401
I thought I was gonna die.

17:36.401 --> 17:37.502
- Hey.

17:37.502 --> 17:39.971
This place gives us a purpose.

17:39.971 --> 17:42.708
Like, a second chance
to help and do right.

17:42.708 --> 17:45.911
- Why would they kill some kids
and spare others?

17:45.911 --> 17:47.479
That doesn't make any sense.

17:47.479 --> 17:48.814
You don't really
believe that, do you?

17:48.814 --> 17:50.549
- Of course.

17:50.549 --> 17:52.050
We were chosen.

17:52.050 --> 17:53.752
I mean, they believe that

17:53.752 --> 17:55.487
we have something to contribute.

17:55.487 --> 17:57.556
We can be worthy.

17:57.556 --> 17:58.824
- If they lied
to everyone before,

17:58.824 --> 18:00.392
why wouldn't they lie
to us now?

18:00.392 --> 18:02.027
<i> - Refusal to work.</i>

18:02.027 --> 18:03.729
<i> Refusal to work.</i>

18:16.708 --> 18:19.511
- Oh, you've had enough?

18:21.546 --> 18:22.647
- Do it!
- Do it!

18:22.647 --> 18:24.750
Jump, jump!
Come on!

18:24.750 --> 18:26.485
Jump, jump!
- You're weak!

18:26.485 --> 18:27.853
- Come on!
You're weak!

18:29.521 --> 18:31.022
You hear me?

18:31.022 --> 18:32.524
- Come on!
Do it!

18:32.524 --> 18:33.892
- You're weak!
- Jump!

18:33.892 --> 18:35.827
- Come on!
- Jump! Jump!

18:35.827 --> 18:37.028
- He's weak.
- You're not worthy!

18:37.028 --> 18:38.530
Now jump!

18:41.933 --> 18:42.934
<i> - Get the net!</i>

18:48.673 --> 18:49.775
- Snip, snip.

18:49.775 --> 18:51.109
- "Snip, snip"?

18:51.109 --> 18:53.011
- I heard anyone
who refuses to work

18:53.011 --> 18:54.913
is sent to the infirmary,
and within a few hours

18:54.913 --> 18:57.716
they come back with alterations.

18:59.918 --> 19:01.086
- What'd he get?

19:01.086 --> 19:02.955
- That's him.

19:21.540 --> 19:25.110
- You must be new.

19:25.110 --> 19:26.111
I'm Cage.

19:26.111 --> 19:28.881
- Blake Redding.

19:34.653 --> 19:37.889
- Governor's kid, right?

19:37.889 --> 19:39.758
That's cute.

19:39.758 --> 19:41.793
Probably used to
getting whatever you want,

19:41.793 --> 19:44.529
like Ellie.

19:44.529 --> 19:47.232
You know,

19:47.232 --> 19:49.634
since you're new here,

19:49.634 --> 19:53.104
I'm gonna take it easy on you.

19:53.104 --> 19:56.808
Ellie belongs

19:56.808 --> 19:59.945
to me now.

19:59.945 --> 20:03.915
You can do whatever you want.

20:03.915 --> 20:09.054
But if you look at her again,

20:09.054 --> 20:11.824
I'm gonna kill you.

20:19.598 --> 20:21.666
Okay.

20:27.772 --> 20:29.241
- It's not gonna stop.

20:37.315 --> 20:39.217
- What's up, boss?
- Hey.

20:39.217 --> 20:42.120
- Hey, what's the deal with
those kids with the patches?

20:42.120 --> 20:43.722
- Oh.

20:43.722 --> 20:45.657
That's The Worthy.

20:45.657 --> 20:47.225
They're hand-selected
by The Incubator

20:47.225 --> 20:50.595
to help supervise
the other workers.

20:50.595 --> 20:53.565
- They're like cops?
- Yeah, more like mall cops.

20:53.565 --> 20:56.768
- They're first in line
for reintroduction.

20:56.768 --> 21:00.539
- Oh, that's pretty awesome.
All this shit's co-ed.

21:01.840 --> 21:04.076
- We're slaves, idiot.

21:05.877 --> 21:07.846
- I'm not a slave.

21:07.846 --> 21:09.247
I'm nobody's slave.

21:09.247 --> 21:11.950
I'm Wade Freeman, bitch.

21:11.950 --> 21:13.618
- You know what?

21:13.618 --> 21:15.554
Yeah,
that's a really good point.

21:15.554 --> 21:17.889
You're Wade Freeman.
- Bitch.

21:17.889 --> 21:20.125
He's Wade Freeman Bitch.

21:38.877 --> 21:40.679
- Go.

21:41.346 --> 21:43.915
- Ellie, what is this?

21:43.915 --> 21:45.216
- Just leave.

21:45.216 --> 21:47.652
- I'm not going anywhere
without you.

21:47.652 --> 21:49.254
- They will kill you.

21:49.254 --> 21:51.289
Please go.

21:51.289 --> 21:55.327
- Uh, this is Cage's girl,
Redding.

21:55.327 --> 21:57.863
So you can move along now.

21:59.598 --> 22:01.266
- We're just talking.

22:01.266 --> 22:03.268
- Move along now.

22:05.170 --> 22:06.771
- No.

22:06.771 --> 22:08.373
I'm not leaving
without her.

22:08.373 --> 22:09.941
- Let's go.

22:16.881 --> 22:18.249
Security!

22:18.249 --> 22:19.818
It's over.

22:27.392 --> 22:29.060
Come on.

22:29.060 --> 22:30.695
- They're
approaching Sector 24!

22:37.836 --> 22:39.204
Come on.

22:42.273 --> 22:43.408
Run. Go!

22:43.408 --> 22:45.410
Run, Ellie!
Run!

23:04.929 --> 23:06.665
- Blake!
- Keep them separate.

23:06.665 --> 23:08.033
- Ellie!

23:08.033 --> 23:10.368
- Blake!
- Ellie!

23:11.870 --> 23:13.371
You.

23:13.371 --> 23:15.740
- Going somewhere, Blake?

23:23.415 --> 23:25.316
No.
- Not anymore.

23:38.096 --> 23:39.931
<i> - Things are heating up
 in an election that</i>

23:39.931 --> 23:42.467
<i> could be a turning point
 in American history.</i>

23:42.467 --> 23:44.803
<i> Texas Governor Dean Redding,</i>

23:44.803 --> 23:46.771
<i> backed by tech leader
 Assuru Global,</i>

23:46.771 --> 23:48.473
<i> is running on
 the strength and success</i>

23:48.473 --> 23:50.909
<i> of the national
 thinning program.</i>

23:50.909 --> 23:52.444
<i> Vermont Senator Elaine Davis</i>

23:52.444 --> 23:54.813
<i> has taken a strong
 anti-thinning platform</i>

23:54.813 --> 23:57.949
<i> that has brought her all the wa
 to her party's nomination.</i>

23:57.949 --> 24:00.385
She calls for a complete repeal
of the thinning,

24:00.385 --> 24:03.154
which has proven very popular
among young voters.

24:03.154 --> 24:05.757
- Enough is enough.

24:05.757 --> 24:07.859
It's time to protect our kids

24:07.859 --> 24:11.262
from this inhumane
and unconstitutional law.

24:11.262 --> 24:15.133
It's time to end the thinning.

24:15.133 --> 24:17.368
- Even with a chance to reform,
Laina Michaels

24:17.368 --> 24:19.370
continues her unwavering support

24:19.370 --> 24:21.339
for Governor Redding
and the thinning.

24:22.974 --> 24:25.844
- Being against the thinning
is a dishonor

24:25.844 --> 24:29.013
to all the brave students
who sacrificed their lives

24:29.013 --> 24:31.182
so we could be here today.

24:32.851 --> 24:34.119
- The Governor
went on television

24:34.119 --> 24:36.154
and called you
a domestic terrorist,

24:36.154 --> 24:39.190
a murderer,
without any evidence.

24:39.190 --> 24:40.759
How can you support someone

24:40.759 --> 24:42.994
who would
so viciously slander you?

24:42.994 --> 24:46.030
And what does that say about
the Governor's leadership?

24:46.030 --> 24:48.500
<i> - I credit a man
 who will correct his mistakes</i>

24:48.500 --> 24:50.201
<i> and own up to them.</i>

24:50.201 --> 24:52.337
<i> Governor Redding
 is that kind of man.</i>

24:52.337 --> 24:54.005
<i> - But the investigation--</i>

24:54.005 --> 24:55.907
<i> - It's been nearly a year,</i>

24:55.907 --> 24:58.843
<i> and nothing substantial against
 the Governor has emerged.</i>

24:58.843 --> 25:03.014
<i> - Why should people vote
 for Governor Redding next week?</i>

25:03.014 --> 25:06.017
<i> - Governor Redding
 has sacrificed everything</i>

25:06.017 --> 25:09.087
<i> for us to move forward
 as a society.</i>

25:09.087 --> 25:12.490
<i> He will do whatever it takes
 to lead this country</i>

25:12.490 --> 25:14.926
<i> and I proudly stand with him.</i>

25:16.828 --> 25:18.096
- And we're out.

25:19.497 --> 25:21.065
All right, let's reset
for the next shot.

25:21.065 --> 25:23.334
Can I get escort
for talent off set?

25:23.334 --> 25:25.036
Thank you very much.

25:29.274 --> 25:31.876
I can't keep doing this.

25:31.876 --> 25:33.812
It's been eight months.

25:33.812 --> 25:35.880
I've been giving you
everything.

25:35.880 --> 25:37.549
Rifling through building files,

25:37.549 --> 25:39.117
photos of restricted areas.

25:39.117 --> 25:41.386
- Now is the time to focus
and do our jobs.

25:41.386 --> 25:43.188
- What do you even do?

25:43.188 --> 25:45.356
I'm out there every day

25:45.356 --> 25:49.027
destroying my reputation
for a few bread crumbs.

25:49.027 --> 25:50.862
I'm putting my life
on the line,

25:50.862 --> 25:52.197
and it feels like
I'm the only one!

25:57.001 --> 25:59.437
I'm sorry.

25:59.437 --> 26:02.540
It's just--
this is eating away at me.

26:02.540 --> 26:05.543
- If you stop now, it's over.

26:05.543 --> 26:08.146
- I need to know Corrine
and Joey are taken care of.

26:08.146 --> 26:11.049
- I will see to it myself.

26:11.049 --> 26:12.550
We now believe that

26:12.550 --> 26:15.620
the files are on
Georgina's private computer.

26:15.620 --> 26:18.590
If you can get access, we can
get what we need and pull you.

26:18.590 --> 26:20.124
- No one is allowed
inside that office

26:20.124 --> 26:21.926
without Georgina present.

26:21.926 --> 26:25.296
- We didn't say
this was gonna be easy.

26:25.296 --> 26:28.132
Find a way in.

26:28.132 --> 26:29.968
If anyone can do it, you can.

26:29.968 --> 26:32.470
- How am I going to
get access to her computer?

26:32.470 --> 26:34.038
They all have password locks

26:34.038 --> 26:36.074
or need special key card access.

26:36.074 --> 26:39.277
- Jean's a digital safe cracker.

26:39.277 --> 26:41.412
- This provides both
the clearance and the file space

26:41.412 --> 26:43.114
needed to secure
any and all files

26:43.114 --> 26:44.616
from Georgina's database.

26:44.616 --> 26:47.185
- The election is next week.

26:47.185 --> 26:50.188
It's now or never, Laina.

26:50.188 --> 26:53.591
And, also,
we know about your friend.

26:55.093 --> 26:56.294
- What friend?

26:56.294 --> 26:57.428
- The one who's been
at every meeting

26:57.428 --> 26:59.097
for the last eight months.

26:59.097 --> 27:02.634
- He's listening in right now.

27:04.402 --> 27:07.405
- Kellan, you can take off
the glasses now.

27:08.973 --> 27:10.909
<i> - No habla inglés.</i>

27:11.943 --> 27:14.679
- My opponent doesn't want
to invest in the future.

27:14.679 --> 27:17.548
He thinks things are going fine
just the way they are.

27:17.548 --> 27:20.118
And I'm here to tell you,
they aren't.

27:22.920 --> 27:25.523
- Your state has more students
with higher test scores

27:25.523 --> 27:27.959
than in the history of Vermont,

27:27.959 --> 27:30.061
and your entire campaign
is about rolling back

27:30.061 --> 27:33.097
all that progress.

27:33.097 --> 27:35.199
- That's a good point,
but I refuse to--

27:35.199 --> 27:37.001
- "That's a good point"?

27:37.001 --> 27:38.937
We're never gonna hear that
in the debate, Alan.

27:42.507 --> 27:44.575
- You mind if
I took a brief recess?

27:44.575 --> 27:46.511
- No.
Go ahead, Congressman.

27:46.511 --> 27:49.514
And, please, take your time.

27:49.514 --> 27:52.116
- Let's have Thomas flown in.
- The former energy secretary?

27:52.116 --> 27:53.551
- Yeah, he won't let up
on anybody.

27:53.551 --> 27:56.254
- Thomas Hausman?
That's no good.

27:56.254 --> 27:58.156
You need to get used to
debating a woman.

27:58.156 --> 27:59.958
- I'll have Lindsay get you
a list of names.

27:59.958 --> 28:02.660
- I can do it.

28:02.660 --> 28:04.596
I'll debate you.

28:05.430 --> 28:08.700
- Well, I appreciate
the sentiment, Laina,

28:08.700 --> 28:11.336
but we're looking for someone
a little more qualified.

28:11.336 --> 28:13.471
- The thinning
is a barbaric program

28:13.471 --> 28:15.373
that blames students
for the failures

28:15.373 --> 28:17.241
of a broken education system.

28:17.241 --> 28:20.111
But it sure makes it easier
to put the blame on students

28:20.111 --> 28:23.081
than having to look
higher on the totem pole.

28:26.651 --> 28:28.619
- Why not?

28:32.724 --> 28:37.128
- Our teachers
are the finest in the world.

28:37.128 --> 28:38.563
And if you're gonna
blame them because

28:38.563 --> 28:40.598
a few students are unwilling
to push themselves

28:40.598 --> 28:43.067
to realize their full potential,

28:43.067 --> 28:45.036
well, I won't stand for that.

28:45.036 --> 28:47.705
- But you will stand
for a program that preys on

28:47.705 --> 28:50.508
the most disadvantaged
students in our society,

28:50.508 --> 28:52.143
students who are
less likely to pass

28:52.143 --> 28:54.145
because of their
socioeconomic background.

28:54.145 --> 28:58.116
Whereas those born with
a silver spoon in their mouths

28:58.116 --> 29:00.051
never truly have to worry
about whether or not

29:00.051 --> 29:01.686
they get to see
the next school year.

29:04.422 --> 29:09.694
- I think we all know
that my son had to worry.

29:09.694 --> 29:11.262
- Blake was one
of the kindest souls

29:11.262 --> 29:14.198
I've ever had
the pleasure of knowing.

29:14.198 --> 29:16.567
And he failed the test
on purpose,

29:16.567 --> 29:19.303
to protest this rigged system.

29:19.303 --> 29:21.339
You tried to bail him out,

29:21.339 --> 29:23.141
but you got caught,

29:23.141 --> 29:24.275
and you threw him under the bus

29:24.275 --> 29:26.744
to advance
your political career.

29:26.744 --> 29:28.379
Is there enough room
for the American people

29:28.379 --> 29:31.216
under that bus?

29:33.418 --> 29:35.253
How was that?

29:36.220 --> 29:38.256
- Uh, that was good.

29:38.256 --> 29:39.657
- Yeah, it was good.
- Really good.

29:44.395 --> 29:46.697
<i> - Assuru global stocks
 are soaring this morning</i>

29:46.697 --> 29:49.434
<i> as the company announces
 its quarterly earnings report,</i>

29:49.434 --> 29:51.135
<i> surpassing expectations</i>

29:51.135 --> 29:52.670
<i> of analysts and
 shareholders respectively.</i>

29:52.670 --> 29:54.305
<i> - Software and services growth</i>

29:54.305 --> 29:56.340
<i> are crucial, but
 it's the hardware...</i>

29:56.340 --> 29:58.709
<i> - Analysts are saying that's
 a 36% jump in R&D spending...</i>

29:58.709 --> 30:00.445
<i> - That's what it takes
 to have stakes in this game.</i>

30:00.445 --> 30:04.315
<i> - Assuru Global ensures
 made-in-America quality.</i>

31:03.541 --> 31:07.545
<i> - All workers, please return
 to living and dining quarters.</i>

31:07.545 --> 31:11.182
<i> All workers, please return
 to living and dining quarters.</i>

31:13.184 --> 31:16.387
<i> All workers, please return
 to living and dining quarters.</i>

31:16.387 --> 31:18.823
<i> Remember: be worthy.</i>

31:26.364 --> 31:29.467
- Hold it, hold it.
You know the rules.

31:29.467 --> 31:31.636
Only The Worthy
and residents of this sector

31:31.636 --> 31:34.572
are allowed in this area.

32:10.541 --> 32:12.743
- Finish his ass!
- Get him, Cage!

32:12.743 --> 32:14.412
- He's a parasite!
Flush him!

32:14.412 --> 32:16.380
- Get up!

32:16.380 --> 32:18.549
I'm not done with you yet.

32:18.549 --> 32:21.953
- You're not worthy!
- Stand up, man, let's go!

32:21.953 --> 32:24.355
- You're not worthy!

32:27.858 --> 32:33.664
- You just don't
got it in you!

32:37.635 --> 32:38.703
- Punch him in the face, Cage!

32:38.703 --> 32:40.271
- He was asking about you.

32:40.271 --> 32:41.739
Who?

32:41.739 --> 32:43.274
- Cage.

32:43.274 --> 32:45.276
He's waiting for you to slip,

32:45.276 --> 32:47.511
force you in there with him.

32:47.511 --> 32:51.249
- Why hasn't anyone
kicked his ass yet?

32:51.249 --> 32:52.583
- I don't know, bro.

32:52.583 --> 32:55.519
Don't look like a bitch to me.

32:56.988 --> 33:00.424
He's not worthy!

33:00.424 --> 33:02.827
He's not worthy!

33:02.827 --> 33:04.562
- Yeah.

33:04.562 --> 33:07.298
- Get this parasite out of here!

33:07.765 --> 33:10.468
- If you're not worthy,
you're nothing!

33:10.468 --> 33:13.337
Worthy! Worthy! Worthy!

33:13.337 --> 33:14.872
- Let's go, Cage!

33:14.872 --> 33:17.976
Worthy! Worthy! Worthy!

33:18.409 --> 33:20.778
- Isn't anybody gonna help him?

33:20.778 --> 33:24.482
Not till after the fight.

33:24.482 --> 33:25.983
- Hey.
- Oh, come on.

33:25.983 --> 33:28.986
- This kid needs serious
medical attention now.

33:28.986 --> 33:31.956
Are you really gonna
make me take him?

33:31.956 --> 33:33.424
- Let's see it!

33:33.424 --> 33:34.759
Come on, let's go.

33:34.759 --> 33:36.627
- Who's next on the list?
- Next victim!

33:36.627 --> 33:38.596
- If you win, you lead.

33:38.596 --> 33:39.797
- Who's got it, baby?

33:39.797 --> 33:42.867
Who's going next?

33:42.867 --> 33:44.935
- Sooner or later, Redding,

33:44.935 --> 33:47.004
you'll be in here.

33:47.004 --> 33:48.839
Sooner or later.

33:51.976 --> 33:53.911
- Come on, daddy's boy,
let's see it!

33:53.911 --> 33:56.714
Let's see the daddy's boy!

34:09.427 --> 34:12.563
<i> - Curfew is now in effect.</i>

34:12.563 --> 34:14.764
<i> Curfew is now in effect.</i>

34:14.764 --> 34:17.001
<i> Curfew is now in effect.</i>

34:25.509 --> 34:26.911
- This is gonna be good.

34:26.911 --> 34:28.413
- Get off.

35:10.554 --> 35:12.456
- See you tomorrow.

35:21.064 --> 35:24.402
That's about an eight.
- Eight?

35:24.402 --> 35:26.137
How about this?

35:28.005 --> 35:30.141
Nine.

35:30.141 --> 35:33.010
- This thing just won't heal.

35:34.812 --> 35:37.615
Blake, what
are they doing to you?

35:37.615 --> 35:40.118
- I fell in the shower again.

35:48.826 --> 35:50.728
What's the deal with her?

35:50.728 --> 35:52.596
- She refused to work.

35:58.969 --> 36:01.605
- There is no reintroduction,

36:01.605 --> 36:03.641
is there?

36:06.610 --> 36:10.214
Do you know that we're all here
against our will?

36:10.214 --> 36:12.183
- The law is the law.

36:12.183 --> 36:15.853
- But they tell everyone
that we're dead.

36:17.588 --> 36:19.190
- I can't be having
this conversation.

36:19.190 --> 36:22.460
- Help me get out of here, Doc.

36:22.460 --> 36:25.596
Doc, please.

36:34.238 --> 36:38.542
- I'll see you in a few weeks.

36:41.846 --> 36:43.514
Let's go, Blake.

36:43.514 --> 36:45.917
On way to living quarters, King.

37:12.276 --> 37:14.479
- Hey.

37:15.079 --> 37:17.715
- Hi.
- Hi.

37:21.752 --> 37:23.854
Have you talked
to Ellie recently?

37:23.854 --> 37:26.657
- Yeah, but
she's always with Cage,

37:26.657 --> 37:28.792
so not for long.

37:28.792 --> 37:32.830
- I need you to get
a message to her, from me.

37:32.830 --> 37:36.200
- You spend so much time
caring for her.

37:36.200 --> 37:39.170
I think it's time you let
somebody take care of you.

37:44.942 --> 37:48.846
- Tell Ellie to come
to the cage match tomorrow.

37:48.846 --> 37:51.215
It's important.

38:02.960 --> 38:04.828
- This isn't gonna take more
than five minutes, is it?

38:04.828 --> 38:06.564
- I'll talk fast.
- Shoot.

38:06.564 --> 38:08.098
- Okay, so I was looking into
the Vista Point story--

38:08.098 --> 38:09.199
- Oh, my God, Kellan,
you have a new angle

38:09.199 --> 38:10.668
on this story every week.

38:10.668 --> 38:12.102
- This one's different.
Five minutes.

38:12.102 --> 38:14.138
- You have one minute.

38:14.138 --> 38:16.974
- I practiced it for five.

38:16.974 --> 38:19.009
Okay, I'll talk very fast.

38:19.009 --> 38:21.745
The machines the T-2401 tests
are performed on

38:21.745 --> 38:23.314
<i> are made by Assuru Global.</i>

38:23.314 --> 38:25.215
both: But we already knew that.
- Right, exactly.

38:25.215 --> 38:27.651
And Assuru Global has been
touting their massive increase

38:27.651 --> 38:29.587
in production, which
I thought I had figured out

38:29.587 --> 38:31.221
when I bum-rushed
Georgina Preston at her office.

38:31.221 --> 38:33.123
- You did what?

38:33.123 --> 38:36.093
<i> - Where you headed, Georgina?
 - Shareholders' meeting.</i>

38:36.093 --> 38:37.995
<i> We're talking about
 how Assuru has tripled</i>

38:37.995 --> 38:39.863
<i> its production
 and is on its way</i>

38:39.863 --> 38:41.765
<i> to having
 a record-shattering year.</i>

38:41.765 --> 38:43.233
- How could you have
increased production?

38:43.233 --> 38:45.202
You laid off
half your workforce.

38:45.202 --> 38:47.905
Obviously our young friend

38:47.905 --> 38:49.340
hasn't heard of automation.

38:49.340 --> 38:50.841
Excuse me.

38:50.841 --> 38:53.010
- I know, it was premature,
you know,

38:53.010 --> 38:55.212
but that gave me everything.

38:55.212 --> 38:56.880
Automation.

38:56.880 --> 38:58.949
<i> If they're making
 more tablets now,</i>

38:58.949 --> 39:00.651
<i> then they're using a lot more
 machines to make them, right?</i>

39:00.651 --> 39:02.252
So I dug up their expenditures.

39:02.252 --> 39:04.288
- How did you get those?

39:04.288 --> 39:06.323
- I have a friend... who hacks.

39:06.323 --> 39:08.092
<i> Not important.</i>

39:08.092 --> 39:10.027
But I found that they
are paying for machines

39:10.027 --> 39:11.195
that they're not
actually receiving.

39:11.195 --> 39:12.930
So I took a tour
of the new campus,

39:12.930 --> 39:14.298
which is really nice.

39:14.298 --> 39:16.834
- Assuru Global
is the industry leader

39:16.834 --> 39:19.003
in cutting-edge
consumer electronics.

39:19.003 --> 39:21.271
<i> - And you should really see
 their manufacturing room.</i>

39:21.271 --> 39:23.340
Really, you should.
Because I didn't.

39:23.340 --> 39:25.142
<i> Because they don't have one.</i>

39:25.142 --> 39:27.177
<i> I walked the entire campus
 with a pedometer.</i>

39:27.177 --> 39:29.013
And if you were to fill
the entire thing with machines,

39:29.013 --> 39:30.948
even in the places I walked--
which had none--

39:30.948 --> 39:32.716
<i> you wouldn't be able
 to get to half</i>

39:32.716 --> 39:34.718
<i> of the output
 that they're shipping.</i>

39:34.718 --> 39:35.886
- So they're outsourcing.

39:35.886 --> 39:37.354
- Right,
I though the same thing.

39:37.354 --> 39:38.956
<i> But according
 to their expenditures,</i>

39:38.956 --> 39:40.324
<i> they're also
 regularly "in-sourcing"</i>

39:40.324 --> 39:41.825
<i> 100 million pounds
 of food per year</i>

39:41.825 --> 39:43.927
<i> from a company called TXPAK.</i>

39:45.329 --> 39:46.964
Military rations.

39:48.232 --> 39:50.200
Let me just make sure
I got this right.

39:50.200 --> 39:52.770
TXPAK is the sole distributor
of MREs

39:52.770 --> 39:55.773
for the entire U.S. military?
<i> - One of three, actually.</i>

39:55.773 --> 39:57.941
<i> We're very proud to be one
 of three major suppliers</i>

39:57.941 --> 39:59.443
<i> for heat-and-serve
 meal packages.</i>

39:59.443 --> 40:01.779
- The average human eats
three pounds of food per day.

40:01.779 --> 40:04.882
<i> They have enough food to feed
 100,000 people per year.</i>

40:04.882 --> 40:07.051
And that's just
what I've found so far.

40:07.051 --> 40:08.385
- What are you saying?

40:08.385 --> 40:10.254
- I think they're using
failed students

40:10.254 --> 40:13.190
to make tablets
and phones and whatever,

40:13.190 --> 40:15.426
and I think it's all connected
to Vista Point.

40:15.426 --> 40:16.427
- How?

40:16.427 --> 40:17.995
- Have you ever looked at

40:17.995 --> 40:19.363
the blueprints
for the original build?

40:19.363 --> 40:20.798
<i> - Of course not.</i>

40:20.798 --> 40:22.466
<i> - I just did.
 Massive vents, by the way.</i>

40:22.466 --> 40:23.967
You could fit a human in there.

40:23.967 --> 40:25.803
They also have
special designated areas

40:25.803 --> 40:27.738
<i> for freight elevators.</i>

40:27.738 --> 40:30.374
And these elevators only go
from the first floor down.

40:30.374 --> 40:33.277
15 stories,
and--and they go to nothing,

40:33.277 --> 40:36.313
nothing that's on the plans.

40:36.313 --> 40:37.881
So I say we call the cops.

40:39.349 --> 40:41.151
- Hi, Brad.
Now's a good time.

40:41.151 --> 40:42.453
- Oh, my God.

40:42.453 --> 40:44.421
- What you have
is circumstantial.

40:44.421 --> 40:46.223
It's a conspiracy theory.

40:46.223 --> 40:48.392
No photos, no videos,
no proof?

40:48.392 --> 40:49.860
No story.

40:49.860 --> 40:52.329
- So you want me
to get video?

40:52.329 --> 40:53.964
- Yes, we are working on
confirming that interview.

40:53.964 --> 40:56.100
- Of an illegal,
underground slave operation

40:56.100 --> 40:57.935
run by the biggest corporation
in the world,

40:57.935 --> 41:00.003
which also happens to be
the single largest donor

41:00.003 --> 41:01.905
to Governor Redding's
campaign for president.

41:01.905 --> 41:03.073
- Can you get a truck
ready for me?

41:03.073 --> 41:04.274
- Super.

41:04.274 --> 41:05.275
- Shut the door
on your way out.

41:05.275 --> 41:06.810
- I'm only 18.

41:06.810 --> 41:07.945
It's my first job
out of high school,

41:07.945 --> 41:09.513
but you got it, boss.

41:09.513 --> 41:11.381
Wish I got thinned.

41:11.381 --> 41:12.983
I don't mean that.

41:12.983 --> 41:14.885
Maybe I do.

41:14.885 --> 41:16.019
Yeah.

42:06.336 --> 42:07.905
- Blake?

42:07.905 --> 42:08.906
- Shh.

42:08.906 --> 42:10.541
We don't have much time.

42:12.176 --> 42:15.078
- I can't keep doing this.
- You have to.

42:15.078 --> 42:16.980
You're so close.

42:16.980 --> 42:19.183
Don't give up now.

42:46.176 --> 42:48.478
- What's up?

42:48.478 --> 42:50.047
I got some brews.

42:50.047 --> 42:51.481
Paid a homeless dude
50 bucks for this.

42:51.481 --> 42:53.550
- Kellan,
it's 2:00 in the morning.

42:53.550 --> 42:54.985
- It's 2:00 in the morning?

42:54.985 --> 42:57.221
That means it's time to party!

42:57.221 --> 42:59.490
Whoo!
Let's cruise and do some shots!

43:00.257 --> 43:04.261
So, you know, I was hanging out
at my place, alone,

43:04.261 --> 43:05.929
and I was thinking,

43:05.929 --> 43:07.497
"Do you know who I want
to hang out with?

43:07.497 --> 43:09.199
My best friend, Laina."
- Kellan.

43:09.199 --> 43:10.601
- Now, full disclosure,
I drank some of them,

43:10.601 --> 43:12.369
so you have
some catching up to do.

43:12.369 --> 43:14.004
- Kellan, what the hell?
They're sleeping.

43:14.004 --> 43:15.505
- Yeah, "what the hell"
is right.

43:15.505 --> 43:17.241
We've gotta get some tunes
in here, it's too quiet.

43:17.241 --> 43:18.475
Oh!

43:18.475 --> 43:19.476
- Kellan, stop.

43:20.911 --> 43:22.479
Kellan, knock it off.
Kellan!

43:22.479 --> 43:24.081
Kellan, why in the world--

44:12.663 --> 44:15.465
<i> - All workers, return
 to living and dining quarters.</i>

44:16.633 --> 44:19.703
<i> All workers, return
 to living and dining quarters.</i>

44:19.703 --> 44:23.173
<i> All workers, return
 to living and dining quarters.</i>

44:23.173 --> 44:25.409
- Hey.
<i> - Remember: be worthy.</i>

44:25.409 --> 44:27.244
- Heather.
- Hey.

44:27.244 --> 44:29.279
- Have you seen Blake?

44:29.279 --> 44:32.182
- I don't know how
to tell you this...

44:32.182 --> 44:34.084
- What?

44:34.084 --> 44:35.719
Did something happen?

44:37.287 --> 44:38.989
- Blake, he--

44:38.989 --> 44:41.491
he doesn't want
to see you anymore.

44:45.562 --> 44:47.998
- I--I didn't--
- Ellie.

44:47.998 --> 44:50.367
You should just move on.

44:50.367 --> 44:52.703
I know that this is
a terrible thing to say,

44:52.703 --> 44:57.074
but you have to live your life
without Blake Redding.

44:57.074 --> 44:59.043
I'm sorry.

45:02.446 --> 45:04.448
Okay.

45:04.448 --> 45:06.316
It's done.
- She gonna be okay?

45:06.316 --> 45:07.985
- Yeah, she'll be fine.

45:07.985 --> 45:11.054
So you're gonna put in
a good word for me, right?

45:11.054 --> 45:12.189
- Absolutely.

45:12.189 --> 45:14.191
I'm very close with Mason.

45:14.191 --> 45:16.159
He takes my recommendations

45:16.159 --> 45:19.496
for a reintroduction seriously.

45:19.496 --> 45:21.765
You did good.

45:34.211 --> 45:37.614
<i> - Dean Redding believes in
 a strong and prosperous nation,</i>

45:37.614 --> 45:39.616
<i> creating
 unlimited possibilities</i>

45:39.616 --> 45:42.052
<i> for its best
 and brightest citizens.</i>

45:42.052 --> 45:44.121
<i> While Elaine Davis
 wants to live</i>

45:44.121 --> 45:46.790
<i> in a country of
 poor, uneducated losers</i>

45:46.790 --> 45:48.525
<i> and sink America's ranking</i>

45:48.525 --> 45:51.061
<i> to the bottom
 of global competition.</i>

45:51.061 --> 45:52.596
<i> If you want
 to continue winning,</i>

45:52.596 --> 45:54.564
<i> vote Dean Redding.</i>

45:54.564 --> 45:57.501
- I'm Dean Redding,
and I approve this message.

46:00.337 --> 46:01.738
- Okay, you guys.

46:01.738 --> 46:04.174
Everything's going
to be okay.

46:04.174 --> 46:07.077
Just be good to Miss Cole.

46:07.077 --> 46:09.780
- Okay.
- I love you both so much.

46:09.780 --> 46:11.648
- I love you, too.

46:19.456 --> 46:21.458
- You ready?

46:28.231 --> 46:30.634
- Hey, guys.
I have breakfast ready for you.

46:30.634 --> 46:33.037
Hurry before it's cold.

46:36.773 --> 46:39.609
- So this is our last chance
at this, right?

46:39.609 --> 46:41.678
- You're going to be fine.

46:41.678 --> 46:43.313
I'll be unreachable
for a little bit

46:43.313 --> 46:44.848
while we get them to safety.

46:44.848 --> 46:47.317
Once you get the information,
all you have to do

46:47.317 --> 46:50.454
is get it to Jack,
and you're home free.

46:50.454 --> 46:52.122
And no matter what happens,

46:52.122 --> 46:54.691
Corrine and Joey
are going to be safe.

46:54.691 --> 46:56.560
We'll be seeing you.

47:08.371 --> 47:09.706
Okay, you can eat those
on the way.

47:09.706 --> 47:10.808
Let's go.

47:12.809 --> 47:14.344
Just down here a little.

47:15.212 --> 47:17.547
This way, guys.
Come on.

47:19.716 --> 47:21.785
Just wait here.

47:39.402 --> 47:41.105
Come on.

47:53.416 --> 47:55.585
- Everything's gonna be okay.

47:55.585 --> 47:58.755
I've got a good feeling.

47:58.755 --> 48:00.457
- Why are you doing this?

48:00.457 --> 48:03.827
- My map is telling me
this is a faster route.

48:03.827 --> 48:06.296
- No, I mean,

48:06.296 --> 48:08.398
why are you helping?

48:10.800 --> 48:15.572
- My little sister, Kelli,

48:15.572 --> 48:19.442
uh, she was dyslexic.

48:19.442 --> 48:21.912
Everything took
a little more time.

48:21.912 --> 48:24.548
Every day after school,
I would stay and help her,

48:24.548 --> 48:26.683
make sure she didn't
fall behind.

48:26.683 --> 48:29.753
Senior year came around, and,

48:29.753 --> 48:33.823
you know, I got too wrapped up
into partying,

48:33.823 --> 48:37.894
and overconfident with
the idea that she would be fine.

48:37.894 --> 48:41.731
And I started
to let things slip.

48:41.731 --> 48:45.969
She was taken from me.

48:45.969 --> 48:47.771
And not a day goes by
that I don't wish

48:47.771 --> 48:50.474
I had done more.

48:54.377 --> 48:56.513
That's why I'm here.

48:58.448 --> 49:01.518
- Well, if this works,
no one will ever have to

49:01.518 --> 49:03.820
go through something
like that again.

49:32.949 --> 49:35.786
- Good luck in there.

49:42.559 --> 49:44.294
- You too.

49:54.838 --> 49:56.740
<i> - It's gonna be
 an exciting race, for sure.</i>

49:56.740 --> 49:58.842
<i> It's really, really difficult
 to know who's gonna</i>

49:58.842 --> 50:00.610
come out on top here,
so we're interested to see

50:00.610 --> 50:02.012
how the day will play out.

50:22.332 --> 50:23.600
- Bathroom?

50:23.600 --> 50:24.968
- Ma'am, this is
a secure facility.

50:24.968 --> 50:25.969
I'll have to escort you.

50:25.969 --> 50:27.003
This way.

50:39.082 --> 50:40.917
Miss?

50:40.917 --> 50:42.819
The bathroom.

51:00.437 --> 51:02.472
- If you don't want to work
on the line,

51:02.472 --> 51:04.341
then you work in here with me.

51:05.642 --> 51:07.644
- Cage! Cage! Cage! Cage!

51:07.644 --> 51:10.781
Cage! Cage! Cage! Cage!

51:15.485 --> 51:16.886
- I don't want
to work on the line.

51:23.560 --> 51:26.029
- I'm gonna enjoy this.

51:26.029 --> 51:27.864
Someone get ole limpy up here.

51:37.374 --> 51:40.477
- Now this is entertainment.

52:06.836 --> 52:08.638
- He was faking it!

52:08.638 --> 52:09.639
He was faking it!

52:09.639 --> 52:11.908
- When you go down,

52:11.908 --> 52:13.810
you're gonna stay down.

52:13.810 --> 52:15.979
- If you go down,

52:15.979 --> 52:17.847
I lead The Worthy.

52:17.847 --> 52:20.650
- I never go down.

53:11.868 --> 53:13.903
- Ellie Harper,
you are in direct violation

53:13.903 --> 53:15.505
of Section 6 work order.

53:15.505 --> 53:17.607
Proceed to your workstation now.

53:27.250 --> 53:28.852
- Come on!

53:38.995 --> 53:40.763
- Yeah, Cage!
Get him!

53:51.641 --> 53:53.243
- No response?
- Nothing.

53:53.243 --> 53:55.011
She won't get up.

54:13.830 --> 54:15.265
I'm getting out of here!

54:16.766 --> 54:18.701
Take her down!

54:37.120 --> 54:38.788
- Take her down.
- No! No!

54:38.788 --> 54:39.756
- Come on.
- No!

54:39.756 --> 54:41.958
- Lock her down.
- Get off of me!

54:41.958 --> 54:43.760
Let me go!
- That's it, guys.

54:43.760 --> 54:44.994
Hey, back to your sector!

54:44.994 --> 54:46.996
- Oh, my God.
- No!

54:46.996 --> 54:48.131
Stop!
- Ellie.

54:50.733 --> 54:51.801
- Cage!

54:51.801 --> 54:53.770
- Get up, Cage, come on!

55:03.913 --> 55:05.281
- No!

55:05.281 --> 55:07.684
- Come on, Cage, get up!

55:07.684 --> 55:11.021
Blake! Blake! Blake! Blake!

55:31.975 --> 55:35.078
Blake! Blake! Blake!

55:40.817 --> 55:43.954
Blake! Blake! Blake!

55:50.660 --> 55:53.896
- The new leader of The Worthy!

56:02.772 --> 56:04.907
- It's Ellie.

56:24.727 --> 56:28.831
- Everything you've been told
about this place is a lie.

56:28.831 --> 56:31.701
There were no killed students.

56:31.701 --> 56:35.104
They did it for cheap labor
to help Assuru make products.

56:35.104 --> 56:38.174
- So...

56:38.174 --> 56:41.277
there's no reintroduction?

56:41.277 --> 56:43.012
- No.

56:43.012 --> 56:45.048
The alarm was for Ellie.

56:45.048 --> 56:48.017
And I can get to her.

56:48.017 --> 56:50.353
But I'm gonna need all of
your help to get her out.

56:50.353 --> 56:52.922
- No one's ever
gotten out before.

56:52.922 --> 56:55.324
- Then this is gonna
end quickly,

56:55.324 --> 56:57.727
but I have to try.

57:00.463 --> 57:03.433
What do you need us to do?

57:05.968 --> 57:08.771
- We just received audio
of presidential candidate

57:08.771 --> 57:12.408
Elaine Davis having a sordid
conversation with a staffer.

57:12.408 --> 57:13.910
<i> - We have to warn you,
 there is some</i>

57:13.910 --> 57:15.411
<i> crude language
 within the tape.</i>

57:15.411 --> 57:17.346
<i> - Oh, come the on,
 Meredith,</i>

57:17.346 --> 57:19.849
<i> voters have their head up
 their ass.</i>

57:19.849 --> 57:21.417
<i> They shouldn't even have
 the right to vote, because</i>

57:21.417 --> 57:23.920
<i> when they do, they just
 this country up.</i>

57:23.920 --> 57:26.823
<i> Everyone between
 California and New York</i>

57:26.823 --> 57:29.358
<i> are dumb
 for brains.</i>

57:29.358 --> 57:31.461
<i> It's not even exaggeration.</i>

57:31.461 --> 57:34.397
<i> It's true.</i>

57:34.397 --> 57:35.998
- This is a game-changer.

57:35.998 --> 57:37.467
I mean,
this could cost her Iowa.

57:37.467 --> 57:39.202
- Is this getting played
everywhere?

57:40.436 --> 57:42.872
- Yeah.
Everywhere.

57:42.872 --> 57:44.807
- Oh.

57:44.807 --> 57:46.909
Whoever leaked this,
I love you.

57:46.909 --> 57:48.311
<i> - She was very...</i>

58:08.364 --> 58:10.166
- You okay in there?

58:14.537 --> 58:15.805
Miss Michaels?

58:31.287 --> 58:33.823
- Oh, my God.

58:46.135 --> 58:48.838
Blake.

58:48.838 --> 58:50.840
- Georgina, Frank Paulsen's
calling for you.

58:50.840 --> 58:53.409
- I left something in my office.

59:18.501 --> 59:21.370
- Excuse me.
Miss Preston?

59:21.370 --> 59:23.539
The Governor would like
to see you right away.

59:23.539 --> 59:25.374
- Give me a minute.

59:34.550 --> 59:36.286
- No.

59:37.620 --> 59:39.956
He said it's urgent.

59:55.538 --> 59:58.541
- That's excellent.
Thank you so much for that.

59:58.541 --> 01:00:01.477
- What?
- Beg your pardon?

01:00:01.477 --> 01:00:04.113
- You told Jack you needed me
for something urgent.

01:00:04.113 --> 01:00:06.416
- No.
No, I didn't.

01:00:19.662 --> 01:00:21.130
- Yeah, go ahead.
Just take it off.

01:00:21.130 --> 01:00:24.133
Take the whole thing off,
I don't care.

01:00:26.402 --> 01:00:27.904
- Everything okay?

01:00:29.972 --> 01:00:32.041
You didn't respond.

01:00:32.041 --> 01:00:34.944
- I had to use the bathroom.

01:00:41.417 --> 01:00:45.221
- Laina.

01:00:45.221 --> 01:00:47.624
What happened to you?

01:00:53.229 --> 01:00:55.097
- Laundry day.

01:00:55.097 --> 01:01:00.069
- Laundry.

01:01:00.069 --> 01:01:02.939
I've never done my own laundry.

01:01:08.244 --> 01:01:10.579
- Go, go, go.
Just--don't stop.

01:01:13.482 --> 01:01:14.717
- Is the shuttle on time?

01:01:14.717 --> 01:01:16.118
- It leaves out of Matamoros
at 6:00.

01:01:16.118 --> 01:01:17.119
- We'll make if we go now.

01:01:17.119 --> 01:01:19.622
I'll lead the way.

01:01:21.357 --> 01:01:23.192
<i> - I'm sorry,
 the number you have--</i>

01:01:26.362 --> 01:01:28.064
<i> - You've reached
 Agent Joanne Morris.</i>

01:01:28.064 --> 01:01:29.966
<i> Please leave a message.</i>
- This is Laina Michaels.

01:01:29.966 --> 01:01:32.068
I need to see you right away.

01:02:07.503 --> 01:02:09.271
- Got a worker down.

01:02:09.271 --> 01:02:10.606
- Oh, chief, he's bleeding.
You gotta do something.

01:02:10.606 --> 01:02:12.608
- Take him to
the infirmary. Let's go.

01:02:12.608 --> 01:02:15.211
<i> - Production ceased
 until further notice.</i>

01:02:23.119 --> 01:02:26.055
- Watch where you're going,
Freeman.

01:02:26.055 --> 01:02:27.690
- Don't touch me, bro.

01:02:27.690 --> 01:02:30.226
- I'm not your bro.

01:02:30.226 --> 01:02:32.661
That's right.

01:02:32.661 --> 01:02:34.597
'Cause you're my bitch.
- Bitch.

01:02:34.597 --> 01:02:36.732
- Yeah.
- Bitch!

01:02:36.732 --> 01:02:38.234
- Fight!

01:02:40.770 --> 01:02:42.038
- Let's go,
let's go!

01:02:42.038 --> 01:02:43.072
- Take out the boys!

01:02:47.810 --> 01:02:50.246
- Seal all exits.

01:02:50.246 --> 01:02:52.081
Code 695.

01:02:52.081 --> 01:02:53.516
All DPC Guards report
to the mess hall.

01:02:53.516 --> 01:02:54.817
<i> Code 695!</i>

01:02:54.817 --> 01:02:56.052
I got an injured student

01:02:56.052 --> 01:02:57.253
here at the East Corridor.

01:03:08.264 --> 01:03:10.633
- You know what to do.

01:03:19.341 --> 01:03:21.110
- Sorry for all the theatrics.

01:03:21.110 --> 01:03:22.678
I don't know
who might be after you.

01:03:22.678 --> 01:03:25.114
- Blake Redding is alive.
- What?

01:03:25.114 --> 01:03:26.449
- I saw him.

01:03:26.449 --> 01:03:28.084
Assuru Global
has a remote complex

01:03:28.084 --> 01:03:29.652
where failed students
are being put to work

01:03:29.652 --> 01:03:31.320
in some kind of labor camps.

01:03:31.320 --> 01:03:34.256
- Who else knows about this?

01:03:34.256 --> 01:03:36.325
- You're my first call.

01:03:36.325 --> 01:03:38.661
- Is your theory backed up
by evidence?

01:03:40.162 --> 01:03:43.632
- Here.
It's all here.

01:03:43.632 --> 01:03:45.234
- We're gonna have to hide you.

01:03:45.234 --> 01:03:47.103
They might be onto you already.

01:03:47.103 --> 01:03:49.138
I need your phone, keys, wallet,

01:03:49.138 --> 01:03:51.507
anything they might have
bugged you with.

01:03:55.511 --> 01:03:59.482
More importantly, your family.

01:03:59.482 --> 01:04:01.617
Where are your siblings?
- They're with a friend.

01:04:01.617 --> 01:04:02.885
- You don't have friends
anymore.

01:04:02.885 --> 01:04:04.520
Who's this friend?

01:04:04.520 --> 01:04:06.522
- Maggie Cole, their teacher.

01:04:06.522 --> 01:04:08.524
She's taking them out
of the country.

01:04:08.524 --> 01:04:11.327
- How?
- I don't know.

01:04:11.327 --> 01:04:13.896
Through some kind of
tunnel system to the border.

01:04:13.896 --> 01:04:15.598
- Okay.

01:04:15.598 --> 01:04:17.900
They're safe.
We can work with that.

01:04:17.900 --> 01:04:19.535
Do you have any
other devices on you?

01:04:19.535 --> 01:04:22.171
- That's it.
- Good.

01:04:24.440 --> 01:04:26.642
Turn around.
- What?

01:04:26.642 --> 01:04:28.544
- Walk to the edge.

01:04:34.250 --> 01:04:35.284
- Wait.

01:04:35.284 --> 01:04:39.188
That sign says "El Toro."

01:04:39.188 --> 01:04:40.789
We're going the wrong way.

01:04:44.560 --> 01:04:46.629
Joey!

01:04:46.629 --> 01:04:48.664
- John.

01:04:48.664 --> 01:04:50.699
- They found my kids.

01:04:54.503 --> 01:04:56.639
- No!

01:04:56.639 --> 01:04:59.275
Please!
Please!

01:05:04.313 --> 01:05:07.183
- You're with Assuru?

01:05:07.183 --> 01:05:08.184
- Kind of.

01:05:08.184 --> 01:05:09.619
<i> - Help!</i>

01:05:16.825 --> 01:05:19.261
Blake.

01:05:19.261 --> 01:05:22.264
- It's way harder for a coroner
to explain bullets in your back

01:05:22.264 --> 01:05:23.933
from an unmarked weapon

01:05:23.933 --> 01:05:26.502
than an overworked employee
cracking under pressure

01:05:26.502 --> 01:05:29.238
and taking the plunge.

01:05:29.238 --> 01:05:31.340
But I'll leave it up to you.

01:05:52.294 --> 01:05:54.330
- Damn it!

01:06:09.578 --> 01:06:11.714
<i> - She may just
 handed this race over</i>

01:06:11.714 --> 01:06:12.882
<i> to Governor Redding.</i>

01:06:16.752 --> 01:06:18.621
- Shit.

01:06:23.392 --> 01:06:24.560
- It's okay.

01:06:24.560 --> 01:06:25.728
You're safe now.

01:06:25.728 --> 01:06:27.029
We just have to hurry.

01:06:27.029 --> 01:06:28.464
Come on.

01:06:40.442 --> 01:06:42.411
- We don't have much time.

01:06:45.881 --> 01:06:50.019
You might want
to look away for this.

01:06:51.020 --> 01:06:52.021
- Oh, no.

01:06:54.323 --> 01:06:55.591
Oh, God...

01:07:10.005 --> 01:07:11.707
What are you doing?

01:07:11.707 --> 01:07:13.909
It was all a lie.

01:07:17.613 --> 01:07:20.049
Who?
Who put you up to this?

01:07:20.049 --> 01:07:21.583
Who put you up to
this?

01:07:27.656 --> 01:07:28.657
Redding.

01:07:36.498 --> 01:07:37.766
<i> - California then
 goes to Davis, but...</i>

01:07:37.766 --> 01:07:39.501
Shit.

01:07:39.501 --> 01:07:41.503
- <i> It may be too late
 in the game.</i>

01:07:41.503 --> 01:07:44.106
<i> I mean, what's happening here
 in the Midwest...</i>

01:07:44.106 --> 01:07:46.075
- Hi.

01:07:54.783 --> 01:07:56.085
Sorry.

01:08:02.124 --> 01:08:04.793
<i> I credit a man
 who will correct his mistakes</i>

01:08:04.793 --> 01:08:06.528
<i> and own up to them.</i>

01:08:06.528 --> 01:08:09.598
<i> Governor Redding
 is that kind of man.</i>

01:08:09.598 --> 01:08:11.633
<i> - BNC can now confirm</i>

01:08:11.633 --> 01:08:14.837
<i> that North Carolina has gone
 to Governor Redding.</i>

01:08:16.939 --> 01:08:18.573
- Congratulations!
- Thank you, Donna.

01:08:18.573 --> 01:08:20.142
Thank you, thank you.

01:08:20.142 --> 01:08:21.609
Barbara, thank you.

01:08:21.609 --> 01:08:23.412
It's still early.
It's still early.

01:08:23.412 --> 01:08:24.846
- How could this have happened?

01:08:24.846 --> 01:08:26.715
My property was stolen
and you did nothing?

01:08:26.715 --> 01:08:27.916
Where's the girl?

01:08:27.916 --> 01:08:29.551
Has anyone found the girl?

01:08:29.551 --> 01:08:32.020
I'll handle this myself.

01:08:41.964 --> 01:08:43.765
- Is this a bad time?

01:08:45.634 --> 01:08:47.136
You have a high-tech program
that can

01:08:47.136 --> 01:08:49.104
extract data from
damaged drives, right?

01:08:49.104 --> 01:08:50.606
- For water damage?

01:08:50.606 --> 01:08:52.774
Oh, yeah.

01:09:01.917 --> 01:09:03.585
- Oh.

01:09:03.585 --> 01:09:06.121
- It's 2040.
It's the best we've got.

01:09:06.121 --> 01:09:09.558
- You don't have something
more cutting-edge?

01:09:09.558 --> 01:09:10.893
- Oh, wait, I got it.

01:09:10.893 --> 01:09:12.895
One sec.

01:09:14.997 --> 01:09:18.167
This is the latest
in fan technology.

01:09:19.768 --> 01:09:21.737
- Clearly.

01:09:21.737 --> 01:09:24.073
- So you've been good?

01:09:24.939 --> 01:09:27.576
Okay, here goes nothing.

01:09:33.549 --> 01:09:35.818
It worked.

01:09:41.189 --> 01:09:42.957
I, uh--

01:09:42.957 --> 01:09:44.859
I gotta make a copy of this.

01:09:44.859 --> 01:09:47.662
This is way too big to have
on one waterlogged drive.

01:09:47.662 --> 01:09:50.198
- Thank you, Kellan.

01:09:50.198 --> 01:09:53.100
You're literally the only person
I can trust anymore.

01:09:53.100 --> 01:09:55.971
- Well, until Blake comes back.

01:09:55.971 --> 01:09:58.907
- Kellan, I--
- No, it's--it's cool.

01:09:58.907 --> 01:10:00.576
We're good.

01:10:00.576 --> 01:10:04.480
I've, uh, moved on.

01:10:04.480 --> 01:10:06.982
Actually, I'm really into
this one coworker of mine.

01:10:06.982 --> 01:10:08.684
It's getting pretty serious.

01:10:08.684 --> 01:10:10.018
She's a little more into me
than I'm into her,

01:10:10.018 --> 01:10:13.055
but I'm warming to her.

01:10:13.055 --> 01:10:14.556
- Isn't Wendy married?

01:10:14.556 --> 01:10:16.592
- Oh, she is.

01:10:18.093 --> 01:10:20.128
But we can trust her.

01:10:20.128 --> 01:10:21.797
And once she sees
what you've got,

01:10:21.797 --> 01:10:24.766
she won't be able
to ignore this anymore.

01:10:24.766 --> 01:10:26.235
Or me.

01:10:27.569 --> 01:10:29.671
All right.
We're all set.

01:10:29.671 --> 01:10:30.739
- Perfect,
I'll bring it to Wendy.

01:10:30.739 --> 01:10:31.840
- Whoa, no.
No way.

01:10:31.840 --> 01:10:33.041
They're looking for you.

01:10:33.041 --> 01:10:35.277
Just stay here and lay low.

01:10:35.277 --> 01:10:38.113
I'll take this to Wendy
and she'll get it live.

01:10:38.113 --> 01:10:40.916
You're, uh--
you're gonna be okay.

01:10:40.916 --> 01:10:41.984
- Thank you.

01:10:41.984 --> 01:10:43.218
- Oh, and whatever you do,

01:10:43.218 --> 01:10:45.020
don't look through
my browser history.

01:10:45.020 --> 01:10:46.555
No, I need you to promise me

01:10:46.555 --> 01:10:48.257
you won't look through
my browser history.

01:10:48.257 --> 01:10:49.791
You know what,
I'm just gonna, um--

01:10:49.791 --> 01:10:50.792
I'm just gonna
delete it quickly.

01:10:50.792 --> 01:10:51.927
Can you close your eyes?

01:10:51.927 --> 01:10:53.829
- Are you serious?
- Please.

01:10:58.066 --> 01:11:00.002
Okay.

01:11:01.637 --> 01:11:03.005
See you soon.

01:12:22.317 --> 01:12:24.686
- Where are we going?

01:12:24.686 --> 01:12:27.022
- Home.

01:12:46.074 --> 01:12:47.142
- Wait!

01:13:25.447 --> 01:13:27.315
Go for it.
- Okay.

01:13:27.315 --> 01:13:29.217
- Did she say
where they were going?

01:13:31.453 --> 01:13:34.222
- Georgina, what's going on?

01:13:34.222 --> 01:13:36.858
- The drive is all that matters.
The girl is of no further use.

01:13:36.858 --> 01:13:38.460
Thank you, Joanna.

01:13:38.460 --> 01:13:40.796
- Who was that?

01:13:41.930 --> 01:13:44.232
- None of your concern, honey.
- Sir.

01:13:44.232 --> 01:13:45.333
Sir, that was Ohio.

01:13:45.333 --> 01:13:47.936
You're over 270.
- What?

01:13:49.404 --> 01:13:50.839
- May I be the first

01:13:50.839 --> 01:13:52.474
to congratulate you,
Mister President.

01:13:52.474 --> 01:13:54.042
- We did it?

01:13:54.042 --> 01:13:56.078
- Yes, we did it.
- We did it? We did it!

01:13:57.746 --> 01:14:00.182
We did it!

01:14:00.182 --> 01:14:02.150
We did it, everybody!
We did it!

01:14:02.150 --> 01:14:03.485
Outstanding!

01:14:07.122 --> 01:14:08.924
- Medical staffers.
Where did they go?

01:14:08.924 --> 01:14:10.893
Uh, southwest corridor.

01:14:17.933 --> 01:14:19.901
Thanks.
- Are you okay?

01:14:19.901 --> 01:14:21.403
- Yeah.

01:14:21.403 --> 01:14:22.938
Let's go.

01:14:33.515 --> 01:14:35.517
- Where is it?

01:14:35.517 --> 01:14:37.452
Where is the drive?

01:14:37.452 --> 01:14:39.388
- Go to hell.

01:14:43.792 --> 01:14:45.894
- Where is the drive?

01:14:45.894 --> 01:14:47.162
Where is it?

01:14:47.162 --> 01:14:48.463
Is it with your sister?

01:14:48.463 --> 01:14:49.998
Your brother?

01:14:49.998 --> 01:14:51.466
'Cause that's where
I'm going next.

01:15:04.546 --> 01:15:07.182
Oh, my--oh, my God.

01:16:16.084 --> 01:16:17.352
- Go.

01:16:19.955 --> 01:16:21.189
- Hey, Marvin,
did you get an ID

01:16:21.189 --> 01:16:23.525
on the car-bombing victim?

01:16:23.525 --> 01:16:25.961
- Wendy.

01:16:26.928 --> 01:16:29.030
- Oh, my God...

01:16:39.040 --> 01:16:42.010
- We just received word
that Senator Elaine Davis

01:16:42.010 --> 01:16:44.379
did call Governor Redding
to concede the election.

01:16:44.379 --> 01:16:46.982
- Which means that
we are only moments away from

01:16:46.982 --> 01:16:49.484
hearing the President Elect's
acceptance speech.

01:16:49.484 --> 01:16:50.552
<i> - This is amazing.</i>

01:16:50.552 --> 01:16:52.621
<i> - What a historic night indeed.</i>

01:16:56.124 --> 01:16:59.461
Where's Laina?

01:16:59.461 --> 01:17:01.964
- She's coming.

01:17:06.401 --> 01:17:08.370
- Ellie.
Come on.

01:17:23.318 --> 01:17:25.086
- Can I help you?

01:17:25.086 --> 01:17:28.657
- I need to see Wendy Banks,
please.

01:17:28.657 --> 01:17:32.928
- Do you have an appointment,
or...

01:17:32.928 --> 01:17:35.264
You know what,
I'll just go get her.

01:17:57.953 --> 01:18:00.355
Oh, my God.

01:18:02.290 --> 01:18:05.660
You did it.
- We did it.

01:18:05.660 --> 01:18:07.696
- Oh, my God.

01:18:07.696 --> 01:18:09.531
- Yeah, they must have
tracking devices

01:18:09.531 --> 01:18:11.166
on all of the failed students.

01:18:11.166 --> 01:18:13.468
- Do you know where this is?

01:18:13.468 --> 01:18:15.637
- The coordinates.
Right there.

01:18:15.637 --> 01:18:18.006
- Kellan was right.

01:18:18.006 --> 01:18:19.741
- We have to
get this out tonight.

01:18:21.476 --> 01:18:23.712
- Marvin,
I need two vans and a chopper.

01:18:23.712 --> 01:18:26.147
- They're all booked out.
It's election night.

01:18:26.147 --> 01:18:27.382
- Forget election night!

01:18:27.382 --> 01:18:29.484
I need a chopper!
Now!

01:18:40.128 --> 01:18:42.230
- There's nothing for miles.

01:18:42.230 --> 01:18:43.365
Which way are we going?

01:18:43.365 --> 01:18:44.366
To hell!

01:19:08.189 --> 01:19:10.592
This time...

01:19:10.592 --> 01:19:12.794
you'll die for real.

01:19:34.816 --> 01:19:36.584
- I'd hate to be Elaine Davis
right about now.

01:19:38.253 --> 01:19:40.155
So I implemented
a few last-minute changes

01:19:40.155 --> 01:19:41.289
to your acceptance speech.
Here you go.

01:19:41.289 --> 01:19:42.357
- Changes?
- Uh, yeah.

01:19:42.357 --> 01:19:43.491
Georgina's team requested that

01:19:43.491 --> 01:19:45.060
we omit your son
from the speech.

01:19:45.060 --> 01:19:46.694
I'm sorry,
she found it too macabre.

01:19:47.729 --> 01:19:48.730
Excuse me.

01:19:48.730 --> 01:19:50.465
Carl--Carl, what's up?

01:19:50.465 --> 01:19:52.367
We're about to go on.

01:19:52.367 --> 01:19:55.703
Whoa, whoa, whoa, slow--
slow down.

01:19:55.703 --> 01:19:57.338
What?

01:19:59.574 --> 01:20:00.809
I'll call you back.

01:20:02.644 --> 01:20:04.512
<i> - We're getting breaking news,
 folks,</i>

01:20:04.512 --> 01:20:06.714
<i> right here, live, at the BNC.</i>

01:20:06.714 --> 01:20:08.349
<i> Blake Redding is alive.</i>

01:20:08.349 --> 01:20:11.553
<i> I repeat,
 Blake Redding is alive.</i>

01:20:11.553 --> 01:20:12.153
- Blake?

01:20:12.153 --> 01:20:13.621
<i> - We're gonna go live to</i>

01:20:13.621 --> 01:20:15.323
<i> a helicopter
 in the Texas desert</i>

01:20:15.323 --> 01:20:17.592
<i> and you will see
 Blake Redding is there...</i>

01:20:17.592 --> 01:20:19.794
- What is this?
- I--I don't know.

01:20:19.794 --> 01:20:21.629
- This isn't very funny.
What is this?

01:20:21.629 --> 01:20:23.298
- Calm down, sir.

01:20:23.298 --> 01:20:25.600
- Somebody tell me
what the fuck is going on!

01:20:25.600 --> 01:20:27.202
<i> - ...and the legitimacy</i>

01:20:27.202 --> 01:20:29.204
<i> of the entire
 thinning program.</i>

01:20:29.204 --> 01:20:31.473
- Dean.

01:20:31.473 --> 01:20:32.740
Dean?

01:20:32.740 --> 01:20:35.710
It's time to make your speech.

01:20:35.710 --> 01:20:38.379
Just go out there and
smile for the cameras.

01:20:41.349 --> 01:20:43.818
You're on, Mister President.

01:20:53.628 --> 01:20:55.363
- You guys,
check the fire escape.

01:20:55.363 --> 01:20:56.865
Out there in two,
three minutes, got it?

01:21:22.657 --> 01:21:23.658
- Thank you.

01:21:37.939 --> 01:21:40.175
Hi.

01:21:40.175 --> 01:21:42.177
- Hi.

01:21:45.480 --> 01:21:47.615
- From this moment,

01:21:47.615 --> 01:21:51.219
united, determined,

01:21:51.219 --> 01:21:54.589
we move forward together.

01:21:54.589 --> 01:21:56.724
- I've worked in PR
my entire professional life.

01:21:56.724 --> 01:21:58.259
There is no way
we can spin this.

01:21:58.259 --> 01:21:59.761
- We don't have to.

01:21:59.761 --> 01:22:01.296
- Look, I don't mean
to be a downer, here,

01:22:01.296 --> 01:22:04.232
but all of this
is extremely illegal.

01:22:04.232 --> 01:22:06.868
- Not anymore.

01:22:08.803 --> 01:22:10.772
Advanced systems.

01:22:10.772 --> 01:22:13.775
Give me the list of everyone who
has ever opposed the thinning.

01:22:13.775 --> 01:22:16.844
<i> We can't break the law,
 because now</i>

01:22:16.844 --> 01:22:18.880
<i> we are the law.</i>

01:22:59.621 --> 01:23:01.856
- Moving in.
Moving in.

01:23:01.856 --> 01:23:03.424
Blake Redding.

01:23:03.424 --> 01:23:04.759
Laina Michaels.
- Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa!

01:23:04.759 --> 01:23:06.427
- Ellie Harper,
you're all under arrest.

01:23:06.427 --> 01:23:08.496
- No, stop, stop!

01:23:21.876 --> 01:23:24.279
- Where are they taking us?

01:23:24.279 --> 01:23:28.349
This doesn't add up.

01:23:28.349 --> 01:23:30.585
- Assuru already had access

01:23:30.585 --> 01:23:34.355
to everyone's locations,
cameras, keystrokes.

01:23:35.923 --> 01:23:38.693
They had to go through
the courts to spy on a civilian.

01:23:41.429 --> 01:23:44.565
It'll only take
the wrong person in power

01:23:44.565 --> 01:23:47.368
to end freedom as we know it.

01:23:47.368 --> 01:23:48.703
- We have to stop them.

01:23:50.938 --> 01:23:52.340
- I don't think we can do--

01:24:18.499 --> 01:24:19.967
- Come on.
- Jack?

01:24:19.967 --> 01:24:21.869
- We gotta go.

01:24:21.869 --> 01:24:23.104
- Who are you?

01:24:23.104 --> 01:24:24.972
- I'm FBI, come on.

01:24:24.972 --> 01:24:26.107
There we go.

01:24:26.107 --> 01:24:29.010
We gotta go, now.

01:24:29.010 --> 01:24:31.346
- Where?

01:24:31.346 --> 01:24:32.780
- We're going to war.

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:44.000
