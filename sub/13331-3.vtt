WEBVTT

00:01.234 --> 00:03.235
.

00:07.507 --> 00:09.309
Geordie Shore is back.

00:09.376 --> 00:11.845
What the hell is gonna happen
this time?

00:12.612 --> 00:13.880
Geordie Tours.
Where?

00:13.947 --> 00:15.982
Across Europe.
(all cheer)

00:16.049 --> 00:17.984
She's sending us to Europe.

00:18.051 --> 00:21.087
(girls) What happens on tour
stays on tour.

00:21.154 --> 00:23.857
Bring on the fucking carnage.
(yells)

00:23.923 --> 00:25.658
Hardcore double sex.

00:25.725 --> 00:27.494
Dust this, buck that.

00:27.560 --> 00:28.628
Sex machine.

00:28.695 --> 00:30.597
The fucking thing will blow up.

00:30.663 --> 00:32.932
There's an atmosphere
between me and James.

00:32.999 --> 00:35.702
James is being a massive dickhead.

00:35.769 --> 00:39.105
(cheering)
Don't be a fool, wrap your tool.

00:39.172 --> 00:42.242
Gary's turned up
and I don't give a shit.

00:42.308 --> 00:44.377
What the fuck's happened
to Charlotte?

00:44.444 --> 00:49.382
I'm in control, then all of a sudden
I wanna shag him. (moans)

00:49.449 --> 00:51.985
Four-way kiss, standard procedure.

00:52.051 --> 00:53.420
Speed dating tonight.

00:53.486 --> 00:56.289
Seen a bird, take her home,
that's speed dating.

00:56.356 --> 00:59.125
I've found someone to bang
and he's game.

00:59.192 --> 01:00.193
(moans)

01:01.227 --> 01:04.664
I've had sex in the house
and Gary has

01:04.730 --> 01:06.466
and it's all weirdly OK.

01:08.134 --> 01:10.236
I should have a degree in pulling.

01:10.303 --> 01:12.539
I'm a Geordie girl with a VIP edge.

01:12.605 --> 01:14.841
If you look up pulling,
my name's there.

01:14.908 --> 01:17.010
I never kiss anyone
without a six-pack.

01:17.076 --> 01:18.878
I'm gonna tear the place up.

01:18.945 --> 01:22.849
I could talk the legs off a donkey.
Got the looks, the charm.

01:22.916 --> 01:25.518
I'm fit, flirty
and I've got double Fs.

01:25.585 --> 01:27.587
Hardest graft is doing me hair.

01:27.654 --> 01:29.856
(all) Geordie Shore, whey-aye!

01:29.923 --> 01:35.428
# "C'mon" - Kesha

01:51.544 --> 01:54.047
That was unreal. Holly,...

02:00.553 --> 02:05.758
We captured cock, brought cock home.
The Cock Capturers are in the lead.

02:09.294 --> 02:12.265
And excuse me. Gary who?

02:16.870 --> 02:18.471
(farts)

02:21.441 --> 02:22.475
Eh?

02:23.510 --> 02:28.181
So me and Gaz wake up hung-over
to fuck and apparently

02:28.248 --> 02:31.684
there's nowt better than a full-on
facial massage. Wicked.

02:39.025 --> 02:41.361
Hi, you all right?

02:41.427 --> 02:45.365
Do you want this on so your hair
doesn't get messed up? Not fussed.

02:47.267 --> 02:48.768
This feels fucking mint.

02:56.676 --> 02:58.378
Yeah, I know, definitely.

02:58.444 --> 03:03.750
To be fair though, like, pulling
wise we've done pretty well like.

03:06.152 --> 03:11.057
Gaz is always banging on about how
he's not gonna get with Charlotte.

03:11.124 --> 03:15.361
Hold on a minute, he said this
last week and ended up banging her.

03:18.932 --> 03:22.535
It's relaxing, isn't it?
I didn't know it was like this.

03:22.602 --> 03:27.106
I thought they slapped something in
your face and you just take it off.

03:27.173 --> 03:29.842
First ever facial massage,
unbelievable.

03:29.909 --> 03:32.712
I'm definitely coming back.
Bye, lovely.

03:37.317 --> 03:39.218
What shall we do tonight?

03:39.285 --> 03:41.854
I was thinking about going on
that date.

03:41.921 --> 03:46.926
I'm going on a date with Graham but
I've never been on a date before.

03:46.993 --> 03:50.697
I might get him to set Holly up
with a friend.

03:50.763 --> 03:52.165
A double date.
Yeah.

03:52.231 --> 03:54.667
Every girl likes to get
a boy jealous

03:54.734 --> 03:58.204
and Charlotte is probably doing this
to get at Gary

03:58.271 --> 04:00.306
and I imagine it's gonna work.

04:01.874 --> 04:06.412
I am about to pick up that phone
cos it is me

04:06.479 --> 04:10.450
who is in control of all of my cock.

04:11.884 --> 04:12.986
Hi Graham.

04:13.987 --> 04:18.257
Good. I was wondering if you wanted
to go out for a few drinks.

04:18.324 --> 04:21.827
I don't know what's come over us,
I've never called a boy.

04:21.894 --> 04:24.530
This isn't like me,
I'm normally really nervous.

04:24.597 --> 04:29.002
I'm part of the Cock Capturers now
and there's no room for nervousness.

04:29.068 --> 04:32.905
Holly wants to come
so we wanna make it a double date.

04:32.972 --> 04:35.174
Have you got anyone you could bring?

04:36.843 --> 04:39.846
Well, that would be a bonus, yeah.

04:43.449 --> 04:46.452
That's fine, that's great.
Shall we say about seven?

04:48.054 --> 04:51.758
He's got a brother
but he tells us this one detail.

04:51.824 --> 04:53.526
His brother's a fucking hobbit

04:54.527 --> 04:55.828
What did he say?

04:55.895 --> 04:59.165
He said he thinks his brother
would fit you perfectly

04:59.232 --> 05:05.171
because he said he's like... He said
he was like five foot... five...

05:05.238 --> 05:09.142
Or something. Is that really small?
(laughs) Five foot five?

05:09.208 --> 05:13.413
I'm five foot three and with me
six inch heels that'd make me...

05:16.082 --> 05:17.583
..five foot nine.

05:17.650 --> 05:19.252
That's five foot nine.

05:19.318 --> 05:20.687
Just do it.

05:20.753 --> 05:23.256
I'm doing this for you.
Yeah, that's fine

05:23.322 --> 05:24.957
You owe me big time.

05:25.024 --> 05:29.962
He might be really nice and his shoe
might have a bit of a platform.

05:30.029 --> 05:31.030
(laughs)

05:34.767 --> 05:37.570
(horn sounds)
See you later.

05:38.805 --> 05:40.506
You all right?

05:40.573 --> 05:43.876
Me and Ricci
are off to get me car washed

05:43.943 --> 05:48.614
cos it's important that the car
looks as fresh as its owner. Guilty.

05:54.921 --> 05:57.924
I'm bringing the missus out tonight.
Are you? Aye.

05:59.425 --> 06:04.263
Fucking right. I'm buzzing.
I haven't seen her for over a week.

06:04.330 --> 06:08.668
James is inviting Kate out tonight
and he can't wait to see her.

06:08.735 --> 06:11.604
That's the only thing
I'm worried about, like,

06:11.671 --> 06:14.107
a kick-off
between Holly and my lass.

06:14.173 --> 06:17.577
Things are so frosty between Holly
and James, they aren't talking.

06:17.643 --> 06:20.680
If Kate comes out tonight,
it could get nasty.

06:27.587 --> 06:30.323
I'm gonna get Kate
to come out tonight.

06:30.389 --> 06:34.727
Holly might get pissed off
but I couldn't give a flying fuck.

06:44.036 --> 06:48.808
She's coming out. Gonna get a quick
pump on and wear some fresh clothes.

06:48.875 --> 06:52.478
I'll look like I've just stepped out
of an Action Man box.

06:54.814 --> 07:00.119
He's not seeing Kate for five hours
and he's started getting ready.

07:00.186 --> 07:03.256
What wrong with the kid?
Princess James.

07:05.358 --> 07:10.496
All I need to do is hit the gym,
get a tan, get me hair cut,

07:10.563 --> 07:15.368
spend about an hour combing it,
moisturise, shave me balls,

07:15.434 --> 07:19.839
choose a decent outfit and baby-wipe
me shoes. It's not that much at all.

07:20.873 --> 07:25.478
Five hours is a fucking joke,
he's not going on a first date.

07:25.545 --> 07:29.015
If it was my bird,
I'd just rock up be like, "Alreet?"

07:34.353 --> 07:37.156
To our first double date together.

07:37.223 --> 07:42.528
So me and Charlotte are about to go
on the date and we're not nervous.

07:42.595 --> 07:45.998
You don't suck them off
on a first date. Right, yep.

07:46.065 --> 07:48.601
And you certainly don't bang them.

07:48.668 --> 07:50.636
Charlotte's never been on a date

07:50.703 --> 07:53.973
so I'm gonna give her
all the advice she'll need.

07:54.040 --> 07:58.611
I didn't know how many dates was
allowed before any sort of foreplay

07:58.678 --> 08:00.179
or sex could happen.

08:00.246 --> 08:03.049
I think it's, like, two.
At least two.

08:03.115 --> 08:06.185
What if you wanted
to get fingered by him

08:06.252 --> 08:08.654
but there was nowhere
to get fingered.

08:08.721 --> 08:11.924
There's always somewhere
to get fingered. All right, OK.

08:15.494 --> 08:17.763
James is bringing
his girlfriend out tonight.

08:17.830 --> 08:21.067
Is he?
He's buzzing to see her like.

08:21.133 --> 08:25.204
James is avoiding Holly. He's hell
bent on ignoring her at all costs.

08:25.271 --> 08:30.977
He is trampling all over Holly's
heart every time he avoids her,

08:31.043 --> 08:33.613
walks away from her.
It's just heart breaking

08:33.679 --> 08:37.683
She's away out now to go on a date
and I just think

08:37.750 --> 08:42.188
if she doesn't know that when she
comes and meet us in the club

08:42.255 --> 08:46.259
Kate will be there, it could all-
If she's had a few drinks.

08:46.325 --> 08:51.297
This could push Holly over and cause
her to really, really kick off.

08:51.364 --> 08:54.367
I don't know.
He hasn't spoken to her for ages.

08:54.433 --> 08:57.403
It's inconsiderate
so someone must tell her.

09:02.241 --> 09:04.543
Charlotte's going on a date,
good luck.

09:04.610 --> 09:07.413
The further we get away
from Amsterdam, the better.

09:08.481 --> 09:11.417
These poor lads
do not have a fucking clue

09:11.484 --> 09:14.887
what they're letting themselves
in for. Not a clue.

09:14.954 --> 09:17.456
See you everyone.
Bye!

09:17.523 --> 09:18.524
Bye!

09:18.591 --> 09:22.595
I hope Holly doesn't get too drunk
and Charlotte doesn't shit herself.

09:34.807 --> 09:38.611
I'm so nervous. What if Graham
isn't as nice as I thought?

09:38.678 --> 09:43.816
What if he's brother is an actual
hobbit and they end up killing us?

09:43.883 --> 09:46.285
That's probably thinking the worst.
Hi!

09:46.352 --> 09:48.087
Hi.
How are you?

09:48.154 --> 09:51.057
All right, not bad.
This is Steven, me brother.

09:51.123 --> 09:53.926
Hi, Steven. Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.

09:53.993 --> 09:56.729
I see my date for the first time,

09:56.796 --> 09:59.332
this is just over
before it's even begun.

10:00.633 --> 10:02.168
I wasn't that drunk.

10:02.234 --> 10:07.039
If you thought I was drunk, god help
what you'll think in ten minutes.

10:07.106 --> 10:10.309
To getting mortal.
To getting mortal. Cheers.

10:14.814 --> 10:16.849
Graham dares Charlotte
to down a pint.

10:16.916 --> 10:19.251
If you down that, I'll strip off.

10:19.318 --> 10:22.021
He'll take his top off if she does.

10:22.088 --> 10:26.092
He underestimates her downing skills,
she's really good with that throat.

10:26.158 --> 10:27.893
Do it.

10:27.960 --> 10:29.228
Without being sick.

10:29.295 --> 10:31.097
She's putting you to shame.

10:31.163 --> 10:34.767
I have downed this pint,
there was no stopping me.

10:34.834 --> 10:36.602
Strip off.
Just do it.

10:36.669 --> 10:41.374
Fair enough, Graham is true to his
word and gets his top off

10:41.440 --> 10:43.376
and he is looking fit.

10:43.442 --> 10:46.679
I'm scared cos I'm scared Steven
can see. He can't.

10:46.746 --> 10:49.548
I've told them I can fanny fart,

10:49.615 --> 10:53.452
I've got me legs open on the floor
with me flaps out.

10:53.519 --> 10:55.121
I've lost it.

10:55.187 --> 10:57.957
Lost what?
The ability to do it.

10:58.024 --> 11:02.328
You know that a date's not going well
when you resort to fanny farting.

11:02.395 --> 11:03.763
Right, get some drinks.

11:03.829 --> 11:06.866
Me and Holly go to the toilet
for a gossip.

11:06.932 --> 11:10.403
You don't fancy him, do you?
Well, yeah. Yeah?

11:10.469 --> 11:14.140
I don't fancy him like that
but you don't actually fancy him?

11:14.206 --> 11:17.810
I don't wanna marry him or anything
but I'd buck him.

11:17.877 --> 11:21.047
Would you? Yeah, but not yet
cos it's the first date.

11:21.113 --> 11:25.317
She doesn't like hers. I'm shocked
cos she put on such a good front.

11:25.384 --> 11:29.588
I tell her I wanna to go
and have some fun. Let's piss off.

11:32.324 --> 11:34.627
It was lovely to meet you.
And you.

11:37.930 --> 11:40.533
Saliva.
See you later, bye.

11:47.573 --> 11:52.078
James is bringing Kate out tonight.
If she looks at us, I'll start.

11:52.144 --> 11:56.182
Holly better not even try
and spoil it. It's not your fault.

11:56.248 --> 11:58.818
Vicky and Ricci
are arguing like kids.

11:58.884 --> 12:02.822
That's what you said to me!
Fucking does my head in. Nice boy!

12:02.888 --> 12:04.056
(smash!)

12:04.123 --> 12:07.159
We think we're in Amsterdam.
Fuck, this isn't Amsterdam.

12:07.226 --> 12:09.028
What the fuck?

12:09.095 --> 12:11.330
(all) Geordie Shore, whey-aye!

12:12.398 --> 12:13.966
.

12:16.535 --> 12:18.504

12:22.908 --> 12:27.413
# "Two Fingers" - Jake Bugg

12:28.547 --> 12:31.817
Where did you go on your date?
(both) Billabong.

12:31.884 --> 12:36.889
So, it was good? Holly wasn't gonna
see him again but she had good crack

12:36.956 --> 12:39.625
We're having a crack on
about their date,

12:39.692 --> 12:43.162
they seem to be in a good mood.
Now's the perfect time

12:43.229 --> 12:45.364
to tell Holly
that Kate's coming out.

12:45.431 --> 12:49.401
I was speaking to Ricci and he was
telling us James is dead excited

12:49.468 --> 12:51.170
cos he's bringing Kate out.

12:51.237 --> 12:56.609
I won't start a fucking argument but
if she dirty looks us, I will start.

12:56.675 --> 12:59.845
She hasn't got it in her.
I'm so much harder.

12:59.912 --> 13:02.681
I'm getting ready
and it's playing on my mind

13:02.748 --> 13:06.185
because I don't wanna be nasty
and I never wanted this.

13:06.252 --> 13:10.689
But her boyfriend isn't speaking to
me, so why should I speak to her?

13:10.756 --> 13:15.628
The worst thing I thought was you'd
get out and it was just happening.

13:15.694 --> 13:18.697
I'm glad I'm aware.
Are you OK about it?

13:18.764 --> 13:21.934
Yeah, it's just... I'm wondering
what she's gonna be wearing.

13:22.001 --> 13:23.969
I reckon it's gonna be white.

13:24.036 --> 13:27.506
Do you though?
I thought it might be white.

13:27.573 --> 13:31.177
I wanted Holly to wear
a white dress. Why white though?

13:31.243 --> 13:32.811
For the special occasion.

13:32.878 --> 13:36.248
She's always fucking wearing white
like she's some virgin.

13:36.315 --> 13:39.451
We know she's not
cos she banging my sloppy seconds.

13:39.518 --> 13:44.523
She's like a pan that's simmering
over and ready to fucking blow.

13:44.590 --> 13:46.959
It's definitely
gonna be Hurricane Holly soon.

13:47.026 --> 13:51.530
I can't wait to see her and speak
to her instead of on the phone.

13:51.597 --> 13:53.732
The kid's buzzing
to see his girlfriend.

14:00.072 --> 14:04.310
Tonight's gonna be mint but Holly
better not even try and spoil it.

14:15.521 --> 14:19.959
So I'm in the club, the tunes are
bouncing, I'm having a mint time.

14:20.025 --> 14:22.928
But all I'm really looking for
is Kate.

14:26.765 --> 14:30.536
And this unbelievable bird walks in
looking like a Greek goddess

14:30.603 --> 14:34.406
and I'm like, "Oh, no wait,
that's my bird, guilty."

14:35.407 --> 14:39.245
The area's so tiny
I don't know how I'm gonna get away.

14:39.311 --> 14:42.348
But I manage to sneak off
and leave them to it.

14:42.414 --> 14:45.417
There's only one thing for it,
gotta get mortal.

14:45.484 --> 14:49.255
Everyone thinks Holly's gonna
kick off at Kate with her past.

14:49.321 --> 14:54.193
No, we're in a club, there's alcohol,
all Holly's gonna do is drink.

15:00.666 --> 15:03.469
Holly is keeping her distance,
that's perfect for me.

15:10.175 --> 15:13.779
When Kate's with James
I can feel that Holly is upset.

15:13.846 --> 15:18.517
He hasn't spoke to Holly and hasn't
give her a tiny bit of attention.

15:18.584 --> 15:20.552
That's making it harder for Holly.

15:26.925 --> 15:31.997
Holly shouldn't be mad at Kate, she
should keep her anger focused on him

15:44.410 --> 15:46.612
She's so frustrated
by the situation,

15:46.679 --> 15:49.848
she wouldn't know how to have
an argument with James.

15:49.915 --> 15:54.453
It's a shame. What he's doing isn't
fair and it deserves a telling off.

15:58.490 --> 15:59.692
It's an amazing night.

15:59.758 --> 16:02.828
The girls are doing their thing,
we're doing our thing.

16:02.895 --> 16:03.962
Happy fucking days.

16:06.565 --> 16:10.102
Gary and Charlotte are still
flirting but on a night out

16:10.169 --> 16:14.940
they're pulling other people.
They want the best of both worlds,

16:15.007 --> 16:18.210
they want each other but they
wanna make each other jealous.

16:22.915 --> 16:25.584
There's a sort of feeling
of achievement

16:25.651 --> 16:29.455
as I am necking on
after I have been on a date

16:29.521 --> 16:32.324
and Gary still hasn't pulled.

16:34.293 --> 16:39.465
This is fucking perfect. "You keep
her occupied, I'm off on the pull."

16:40.566 --> 16:42.368
They're saying they don't care,

16:42.434 --> 16:46.004
they're not bothered, when everyone
else knows they are bothered

16:49.875 --> 16:51.243
(drunken cheering)

16:54.546 --> 16:55.781
Watch your step.

16:55.848 --> 17:00.285
Me and Kate get back, so there's
no messing about, straight to bed.

17:00.352 --> 17:01.453
# Bring the action #

17:03.355 --> 17:06.157
If you've got a boyfriend
as good-looking as me,

17:06.224 --> 17:09.627
it's only natural it's gonna happen,
you do the math.

17:12.830 --> 17:16.734
We get back from the club, everyone's
smashed, all over the house.

17:16.801 --> 17:20.406
I've never known anyone to be
so nasty and so horrible.

17:20.472 --> 17:22.840
What have I done, baby?
Know what you said?

17:22.907 --> 17:28.247
Ricci's pissed, I'm pissed and as
usual, there's fucking fireworks.

17:28.313 --> 17:31.316
You're a fucking disgusting
human being. Don't do that.

17:31.383 --> 17:34.052
I love you.
That's what you said to me!

17:38.490 --> 17:41.994
Vicky and Ricci are arguing
like a couple of kids again.

17:47.166 --> 17:50.536
Fucking does my head in.
It affects the mood of everyone.

17:50.602 --> 17:52.838
Vicky, come here now!
You're a fuck...

17:53.839 --> 17:55.307
I try to calm down.

17:55.374 --> 17:59.812
The two times I've been in the
mood... Do I ever get in a mood?

17:59.878 --> 18:03.248
..you've got me out of them.
Try to calm Ricci down,

18:03.315 --> 18:04.783
he just bites.

18:04.850 --> 18:08.020
All of you out.
GET OUT!

18:08.086 --> 18:11.356
So I just go on a fucking rampage.

18:11.423 --> 18:14.693
You know what it is, fuck you all.
Nice boy!

18:14.760 --> 18:19.531
I don't know who's tickled Scott's
balls but he's going nuts. (smash!)

18:19.598 --> 18:21.967
Scott comes in
punching the fucking light,

18:22.034 --> 18:26.071
smashes a dish and I'm like,
"What the fuck's going on here?"

18:28.040 --> 18:32.044
Scott, remember what you've just
said to us. Scott, remember.

18:35.047 --> 18:36.448
(groans)

18:36.515 --> 18:39.852
Scott's really, really angry.
I've never really seen him like that.

18:39.918 --> 18:42.087
Fine, fine, fine, fine. He's fine.

18:45.924 --> 18:50.195
I'm trying to calm him down, get him
into bed. I'll make him feel better.

18:53.131 --> 18:57.002
Holly is to the bloody rescue,
lying in Scott's bed

18:57.069 --> 19:00.205
giving him some kind of oral
under the sheets.

19:00.272 --> 19:02.708
Cant get enough
of the fucking length.

19:02.774 --> 19:07.412
A glass of milk.
I know you like milk. (chattering)

19:07.479 --> 19:09.114
Charlotte!

19:12.584 --> 19:16.455
It's all settled down and it's only
me and Charlotte still up.

19:20.759 --> 19:24.663
I'm pissed, she's pissed,
I can see where this is going.

19:26.932 --> 19:31.069
I just wanna go to fucking bed.
Ow, me fucking leg!

19:37.476 --> 19:41.547
For some crazy second me and Gary

19:41.613 --> 19:47.352
think we're in Amsterdam and not in
Newcastle. I am. I'm in the shag pad

19:50.455 --> 19:52.858
Fuck, this isn't the boat,
this isn't Amsterdam.

19:52.925 --> 19:56.929
I don't want to give in to Gary.
I mean,

19:56.995 --> 20:00.732
I'm a Cock Capturer after all
but I can't resist the parsnip.

20:00.799 --> 20:03.669
It's not even one position,
it's every single one.

20:06.004 --> 20:08.106
I can't believe I've done this.

20:10.442 --> 20:11.977
What the fuck?

20:12.044 --> 20:15.647
I just don't know how much more
of this I can take.

20:15.714 --> 20:17.449
I've woken up in Scott's bed.

20:17.516 --> 20:20.652
I see them as sisters
who occasionally suck us off.

20:20.719 --> 20:22.788
Was it big?
It is really big.

20:22.854 --> 20:26.491
How am I meant to work with Holly
when I'm not speaking to her?

20:26.558 --> 20:28.860
I'd lost you as a friend.

20:28.927 --> 20:31.396
No, we'll never ever
be friends again.

20:31.463 --> 20:33.599
(all) Geordie Shore, whey-aye!

20:34.666 --> 20:36.335
.

20:39.037 --> 20:41.039
.

20:45.277 --> 20:50.148
# "Mountain Sound"
- Of Monsters And Men

20:54.086 --> 20:57.222
It's the morning
and I'm feeling so uneasy.

20:57.289 --> 21:01.893
I can't believe I was on a roll,
then I went back to bed with Gary.

21:03.996 --> 21:09.768
I'm just so glad I'm out
of the bedroom. (farts, sighs)

21:12.037 --> 21:15.307
Last night was the best night
I've had in here.

21:15.374 --> 21:18.744
It was unreal to see Kate
and spend time with her.

21:18.810 --> 21:21.213
I'm gutted she's got to go now.

21:22.648 --> 21:25.250
I've woken up in Scott's bed

21:25.317 --> 21:27.986
and I've no idea
what happened once again.

21:28.053 --> 21:32.424
Did you kiss Scotty T? I don't know
but I definitely sucked him off.

21:32.491 --> 21:37.529
I can suck him off and they'll never
been any awkwardness the next day.

21:38.797 --> 21:40.532
It is really big.

21:43.201 --> 21:47.439
He's a six foot three man surely
it's just fucking laws of physics.

21:47.506 --> 21:51.643
I've also had little skinny boys
who've had massive ones. Like Gaz.

21:52.678 --> 21:58.283
What happened with Gary was when we
were drunk, very, very, very drunk.

21:58.350 --> 22:02.187
So I can't remember it,
so it didn't happen

22:02.254 --> 22:06.458
and no-one will speak about it
ever again.

22:06.525 --> 22:10.562
Why are you wearing Gary's T-shirt,
you fucking slag? I bucked him.

22:10.629 --> 22:12.464
(laughter)

22:12.531 --> 22:14.700
They are like cock homing pigeons.

22:14.766 --> 22:17.469
They'll always go straight back
to Gaz and Scott.

22:24.276 --> 22:26.745
(laughs) I love it when he lies.

22:26.812 --> 22:31.216
It won't develop into a relationship
cos I'm done with that shit.

22:31.283 --> 22:33.618
I don't get relationships
in the house.

22:33.685 --> 22:36.588
I see them as sisters
who occasionally suck us off.

22:41.026 --> 22:42.294
Lucky me.

22:42.360 --> 22:45.163
If me and Charlotte wanna bang,
we'll bang.

22:45.230 --> 22:48.900
If she wants to pull she'll pull,
I'll go and pull.

22:48.967 --> 22:53.472
Yes, we probably will bang again. Do
I know when? No. I never fucking do.

23:08.754 --> 23:10.889
Mine and Ricci's row started

23:10.956 --> 23:14.593
cos he'd had far too much to drink
as per fucking usual.

23:20.065 --> 23:23.869
Mine and Ricci's massive argument is
brushed under the rug and forgotten

23:23.935 --> 23:28.106
cos that's what you do in healthy
relationships. Fuck's sake.

23:31.877 --> 23:32.878
Oh, now?

23:32.944 --> 23:35.147
When he's had too much to drink

23:35.213 --> 23:38.884
he always finds something I've done
wrong. He gets ridiculously jealous.

23:38.950 --> 23:42.721
I just don't know how much
more of this I can take.

23:42.788 --> 23:44.489
See you later.
Ta-ra.

23:44.556 --> 23:45.590
Bye!

23:49.761 --> 23:54.733
After last night, Vicky wants to go
for a walk, clear her head and talk.

23:54.800 --> 23:58.804
There is definite atmosphere
in the house, I think.

23:58.870 --> 24:02.908
It doesn't help when you've got
the Holly and James situation.

24:02.974 --> 24:06.745
With Charlotte being single and us
fucking sleeping together again,

24:06.812 --> 24:09.981
that's always gonna cause
a bit of tension. Yeah.

24:10.048 --> 24:13.652
Obviously if you and Ricci argue that
causes fucking tension.

24:13.718 --> 24:17.622
If we argue? (laughs) When you argue
that causes tension. I know.

24:17.689 --> 24:20.091
We end up talking about me
and Charlotte.

24:20.158 --> 24:23.962
She falls for you a bit more
every time she sleeps with you.

24:24.029 --> 24:26.264
I don't know what the solution is.

24:27.732 --> 24:28.800
I know.

24:28.867 --> 24:33.371
I've never seen eye to eye with Gary
He's the person that hurts Charlotte

24:33.438 --> 24:37.442
but now I think it's unfair
to give him that label

24:37.509 --> 24:40.679
because Charlotte's daft enough
to make her own mistakes.

24:40.745 --> 24:42.447
Would you ever...?

24:44.449 --> 24:45.450
(laughs)

24:48.653 --> 24:51.723
Imagine if Gary and Charlotte
made it as a couple.

24:51.790 --> 24:55.560
You would have on your hands
someone so obsessed

24:55.627 --> 24:58.163
and insanely in love with you

24:58.230 --> 25:01.333
that they can create situations
that aren't actually happening.

25:01.399 --> 25:06.638
I'd go out, look at a girl or breathe
at one, "Fucking get off her!"

25:09.641 --> 25:12.444
It's not happening.
We're having this conversation

25:12.510 --> 25:15.146
about his and Charlotte's
future together.

25:15.213 --> 25:18.450
Will they, won't they?
Can they make it work?

25:18.516 --> 25:23.021
All this while, he's wearing a
T-shirt with "I love sluts" on.

25:23.088 --> 25:26.925
He loves sluts,
he just fucking loves them.

25:29.928 --> 25:32.764
(phone rings)
Telephone!

25:32.831 --> 25:34.966
Too comfortable here me.

25:37.869 --> 25:42.007
Hello. Hi, it's Anna. Hi, Anna.
I've got a hen party booked

25:42.073 --> 25:44.109
on the limo bus tonight.
OK, babe.

25:44.175 --> 25:48.546
Anna needs two people to go to work
tonight and guess who it is?

25:48.613 --> 25:50.415
Work.
Work who?

25:50.482 --> 25:53.852
You two. Holly and James.

25:53.919 --> 25:58.556
Shock. I have to go to work
with that stupid immature prick

25:58.623 --> 26:01.459
and pretend that I'm fucking happy.

26:01.526 --> 26:05.163
How am I meant to work with Holly
when I'm not speaking to her?

26:05.230 --> 26:08.667
See you later.
Holly's had it up to here

26:08.733 --> 26:12.804
and so the rest of the house.
It's time to get this resolved,

26:12.871 --> 26:15.874
and hold James accountable
for how he's been treating her.

26:18.243 --> 26:22.480
I'm in the car with James and we're
sat right next to each other

26:22.547 --> 26:25.216
and I'm looking out of my window.

26:25.283 --> 26:30.855
I have never, ever, ever felt tension
like this in my entire life.

26:30.922 --> 26:35.727
This isn't what we used to be. I used
to be sucking him off in taxis.

26:37.762 --> 26:39.464
Hi.
Hi.

26:39.531 --> 26:41.666
I'm working, gotta host a hen do.

26:41.733 --> 26:44.736
We get to the bus,
we meet the girls,

26:44.803 --> 26:47.505
there's not gonna be
any complaints from Anna.

26:49.808 --> 26:52.677
James is actually
doing really well with the girls,

26:52.744 --> 26:57.882
we're putting our differences aside
to say, "Can you pour them a drink?"

26:57.949 --> 27:01.720
That's all. That's all we're saying
and there's slight eye contact.

27:06.424 --> 27:08.927
Thanks very much, have a good night.

27:08.994 --> 27:12.897
Enjoy the rest of your night. See
you later. Cheers. Good night.

27:12.964 --> 27:16.935
Work's done, the girls have left.
It's just me and Holly left.

27:17.002 --> 27:19.170
That was all right, wasn't it?

27:19.237 --> 27:22.707
Yeah, erm,...
I think we need to talk though.

27:22.774 --> 27:24.609
Aye.

27:24.676 --> 27:29.547
I'm thinking it's now or never.
We're alone, we're out of the house,

27:29.614 --> 27:31.649
no arguments can really kick off.

27:31.716 --> 27:35.220
It's the perfect time to bring up,
what the fuck's going on?

27:35.286 --> 27:39.958
Do you know how proper,
proper awkward it's been?

27:40.025 --> 27:44.562
There's two sides to every story so
I'm gonna hear what she has to say.

27:44.629 --> 27:49.000
She's got this fucking rehearsed
speech. She's going over and over it

27:49.067 --> 27:53.905
I can't even walk up a flight
of stairs without you hesitating

27:53.972 --> 27:55.740
in case you're walking behind me.

27:55.807 --> 28:01.079
Or if you're stood next to someone,
you'll move away if I'm stood there.

28:01.146 --> 28:04.783
I'm telling him every way
that he's made me feel.

28:04.849 --> 28:09.287
It wasn't about anything, it was the
fact that I'd lost you as a friend.

28:09.354 --> 28:13.425
Holly doesn't get it, she's never
been in a serious relationship.

28:13.491 --> 28:17.295
You'll understand one day when you
meet someone you really care about.

28:17.362 --> 28:19.931
James is massively patronising me

28:19.998 --> 28:23.268
saying, "You'll understand
when you're in love."

28:23.334 --> 28:25.737
When you meet someone
you really care-

28:25.804 --> 28:29.441
you won't do anything to upset them.
I've been in situations like that.

28:29.507 --> 28:33.645
I cared about you. I've been there.
I know how it fucking feels.

28:33.711 --> 28:36.347
Don't that to me
because I do know.

28:36.414 --> 28:40.018
Every day that you ignored me
made it ten times fucking easier

28:40.085 --> 28:42.253
to forget the feelings we ever had.

28:42.320 --> 28:45.023
Don't worry about that.
Looks like me plan worked.

28:45.090 --> 28:47.158
What? You had a fucking plan?

28:47.225 --> 28:50.895
I'm sorry but after not speaking
to me for two weeks

28:50.962 --> 28:52.964
and making me feel fucking awkward,

28:53.031 --> 28:56.734
you expect me to say
we can go back to being friends?

28:56.801 --> 28:59.370
No.
We'll never ever be friends again.

28:59.437 --> 29:02.073
Right, get back to the house then.
Mint.

29:16.654 --> 29:21.092
For one minute I actually thought
that me and Holly were gonna sort it

29:21.159 --> 29:23.128
and go back to being friends.

29:23.194 --> 29:28.399
But no she's contradicted herself
and she doesn't want to be me friend

29:28.466 --> 29:31.302
I'll go back to my life,
get on with it.

29:31.369 --> 29:36.641
I'd love to say, "We can be friends,
let's all be one big happy family."

29:36.708 --> 29:39.344
"Sorry,
but you fucking treat me like shit."

29:39.410 --> 29:42.013
I'm proud of you
standing your ground

29:42.080 --> 29:43.982
I'm buzzing me.

29:44.048 --> 29:47.585
I knew it'd be, like, you
making the first move.

29:47.652 --> 29:50.054
He's proved that-
He's stubborn, isn't he?

29:50.121 --> 29:51.923
He's a fucking child.

29:51.990 --> 29:56.427
He's got no clue whatsoever
about women really.

29:56.494 --> 29:59.097
Sometimes he's just
so fucking nasty.

29:59.164 --> 30:02.000
What's going on between me
and Ricci isn't OK.

30:02.066 --> 30:04.135
I cant do any more cock capturing.

30:04.202 --> 30:07.639
How about tonight then,
you give being ladies a go?

30:07.705 --> 30:11.609
Who needs cock? I don't remember
Kate Middleton doing a titty-shake.

30:11.676 --> 30:15.847
I'm necking on. I can't wait to get
upstairs, do the business.

30:15.914 --> 30:17.649
(girl moans)
Raarrrrrr!

30:17.715 --> 30:19.884
(all) Geordie Shore, whey-aye!

30:20.952 --> 30:22.587
.

30:25.557 --> 30:27.559
.

30:31.996 --> 30:37.035
# "Lightning Bolt" - Jake Bugg

30:41.973 --> 30:44.976
I've woke up this morning,
I feel fucking minging.

30:45.043 --> 30:49.280
The bed sheets fucking stink so I'm
taking the girls to the laundrette.

30:51.149 --> 30:55.053
Because your fucking bed clothes
stink of, like, fanny and that

30:55.119 --> 30:58.489
and I need to go wash them.
(girls) Eurgh! Eurgh!

30:58.556 --> 31:01.159
He's like the gay best friend.

31:01.226 --> 31:06.231
He cooks, cleans and even wants to
take us to the launderette, perfect.

31:15.974 --> 31:16.975
Doubt it like.

31:17.041 --> 31:20.612
What if a girl was like bending over
the washing machine?

31:20.678 --> 31:22.480
With little shorts on.

31:26.317 --> 31:28.886
He's getting a stiffy.

31:28.953 --> 31:32.357
The girls keep asking me
why I'm so good at pulling.

31:32.423 --> 31:34.359
There's no great myth to it.

31:34.425 --> 31:39.264
It helps that I'm six foot three and
I've been carved from fucking stone.

31:39.330 --> 31:44.135
Do you know, if there was a girl
in the house who you quite fancied,

31:44.202 --> 31:48.740
you'd be living with her, 24/7,
you'd be getting drunk with her,

31:48.806 --> 31:52.477
you'd be shagging her and
she felt the same way, would you?

31:52.543 --> 31:55.580
If she was fit
and I liked her, why not?

31:55.647 --> 32:00.051
If there is ever a new girl, will
you get in there before Gary? Why?

32:00.118 --> 32:02.053
Cos I couldn't stand that.

32:02.120 --> 32:04.656
With Charlotte and Gary,
it's a vicious circle.

32:04.722 --> 32:07.525
She says she's not bothered,
he says he's not,

32:07.592 --> 32:12.196
but is she starting to get a bit
bothered about Gary pulling girls?

32:12.263 --> 32:15.733
If a new girl came
and he got with her, I'd leave.

32:15.800 --> 32:21.306
I love all the girls in the house
but I get on with Charlotte most.

32:21.372 --> 32:26.244
She's like my twin sister apart from
the fact that she is thick as fuck.

32:30.548 --> 32:33.051
(phone rings)

32:37.322 --> 32:38.323
Hello?

32:38.389 --> 32:41.826
It is. Hiya, Anna, you all right?

32:41.893 --> 32:47.065
Wouldn't you know it, it's another
fucking pointless work outing?

32:47.131 --> 32:49.567
Anna wants me, you,

32:49.634 --> 32:54.138
and Scott to go to work tonight
for a hen party.

32:54.205 --> 32:55.773
I don't mind that.

32:55.840 --> 33:00.311
Anna's throbbing over me. Every time
that phone rings it's me in work.

33:08.686 --> 33:11.222
All right?
Scott, mate, nice to meet you.

33:11.289 --> 33:14.025
Charlotte.
I'm Vicky.

33:14.092 --> 33:17.195
We've got to make cocktails
for a hen do.

33:19.230 --> 33:22.266
All I can think about
is the argument

33:22.333 --> 33:25.503
and I just really
can't be arsed at all.

33:25.570 --> 33:29.207
Can we do some tequilas?
Yeah, let's do some tequilas.

33:29.273 --> 33:31.175
Cheers.
Tequila!

33:31.242 --> 33:34.812
These jobs are ridiculous.
I don't give a shit about Anna

33:34.879 --> 33:38.683
or the hen party.
Let's just all get mortal instead.

33:43.888 --> 33:48.559
Charlotte and Vicky have had a sniff
of alcohol and they're smashed.

33:48.626 --> 33:50.762
I'll have to do all the graft.

33:50.828 --> 33:53.297
Anyway cheers, girls.
Cheers.

33:53.364 --> 33:54.999
There you go, girls.

33:55.066 --> 33:58.169
Scott has managed
to entertain all the girls,

33:58.236 --> 34:01.672
running around, making drinks,
flexing his muscles, flirting.

34:03.307 --> 34:05.009
What a wanker.

34:05.076 --> 34:08.980
Can we all make a Geordie Shore
cocktail? If you're really good.

34:09.045 --> 34:11.882
Let's do it.
So we need some of them.

34:13.117 --> 34:16.654
So first we start off with raspberry
vodka and blueberry vodka,

34:16.721 --> 34:18.755
like Charlotte and Sophie,
dopey berries.

34:18.822 --> 34:22.493
Then add rum cos it packs
a wicked punch like Scotty T.

34:22.560 --> 34:25.530
Cranberry juice, like Gaz,
both associated with STI's,

34:25.596 --> 34:28.199
and apple juice like James,
fucking pointless.

34:28.266 --> 34:32.370
And then the raspberries, me, a
refreshing break from the madness.

34:34.272 --> 34:37.742
Oh, my God. It explodes
in your mouth. Fucking yes.

34:37.809 --> 34:41.279
You helped us as well.
Co-creators. Whoo!

34:41.344 --> 34:43.080
Result, phone number.

34:43.147 --> 34:45.183
Result, pissed.

34:45.248 --> 34:49.085
We're on the way home
and I want Vicky to know

34:49.152 --> 34:52.089
when her and Ricci argue
it does everyone's head in.

34:53.991 --> 34:55.560
I didn't know, babe.

34:55.626 --> 35:00.164
Basically I elbowed the toaster,
I punched a light in my room.

35:00.231 --> 35:03.868
Hearing Scott tells us what he did
is just horrible.

35:03.935 --> 35:08.706
It's hitting home what a huge effect
our arguments have on the house.

35:08.773 --> 35:11.175
Sometimes he's wicked.
He can be so nice

35:11.242 --> 35:13.978
and sometimes
he's just so fucking nasty.

35:14.045 --> 35:18.416
It's those stages what happens with
everyone when you've had too much.

35:22.787 --> 35:26.257
Scott and Charlotte are offering
advice and trying to help.

35:26.324 --> 35:29.327
But what's going on
with me and Ricci isn't OK.

35:29.393 --> 35:31.395
I'm not sure how to fix it.

35:35.433 --> 35:38.769
We like going out as a family.
We're going to the casino.

35:38.836 --> 35:41.706
Howeh girls, you ready?
Yeah, we're coming.

35:41.772 --> 35:42.807
Nash on.

35:42.874 --> 35:45.009
We're off to the casino.

35:45.076 --> 35:48.246
I'm not a gambling man
cos I hate losing money.

35:48.312 --> 35:52.917
I've never gambled so I'm hoping
I'm gonna get beginners' luck.

35:52.984 --> 35:54.785
You been to the cas before?

35:54.852 --> 35:59.457
I've been a couple of times but
I haven't got a clue how to gamble.

35:59.524 --> 36:03.160
Everyone knows that money won
is twice as good as money earned.

36:03.227 --> 36:05.930
Dan will play it safe.
He'll bet five pence

36:05.997 --> 36:09.567
and if he wins he'll go home
and have a fucking wank.

36:20.144 --> 36:23.080
What does that mean?
I don't understand.

36:23.147 --> 36:25.349
The girls haven't got a clue.

36:25.416 --> 36:28.486
They're putting random chips
on random numbers.

36:28.553 --> 36:32.890
You get, er, 18... You get 27 quid.

36:32.957 --> 36:34.892
What?

36:36.527 --> 36:39.997
That's yours, all yours.
Keep your fives. Well done, babe.

36:40.064 --> 36:43.367
Yes! How much did you win?
Er, loads.

36:43.434 --> 36:48.839
I don't know if it's beginners' luck
or the luck of the lady from within

36:48.906 --> 36:54.011
but whatever luck it is it didn't
fucking last very long.

36:54.078 --> 36:57.748
Oh, no, I'm running out.
I'm still winning.

36:57.815 --> 37:02.787
This is shit. I'm not playing. I've
got something to talk to Holly about

37:02.853 --> 37:04.855
I've got to take a holiday.

37:04.922 --> 37:08.359
What for? I can't do any more
cock capturing just yet.

37:08.426 --> 37:12.263
I was thinking you need a break.
You were thinking it? Yeah

37:12.330 --> 37:16.534
Charlotte wants a break from the Cock
Capturers because she's overworked.

37:16.601 --> 37:20.171
I'm thinking it's cos she slept
with Gary the other night.

37:22.106 --> 37:23.107
No bother.

37:26.010 --> 37:27.511
With me and Charlotte...

37:32.083 --> 37:36.454
It's all good when Charlotte's off
pulling, I'm like, "I'll do it too."

37:36.520 --> 37:40.157
She got no grounds to argue,
shout and fight with us.

37:40.224 --> 37:44.729
As soon as she stops pulling and
I keep pulling and go back to her,

37:44.795 --> 37:46.230
that's when things get messy.

37:50.401 --> 37:53.571
Yeah, yeah, but when she stops
if she wasn't pulling.

37:53.638 --> 37:55.973
(all talk at once)

37:56.040 --> 38:00.177
Gaz reckons him and Charlotte are
just bucking, that's fucking shit.

38:00.244 --> 38:02.413
They're not kidding anyone.

38:10.655 --> 38:14.058
Scott and Holly have got what me
and Charlotte first started off at.

38:14.125 --> 38:18.829
It's a comfort thing. When you get
pissed, it's a person to go to.

38:18.896 --> 38:20.898
You wake up like, "Fuck, again?"

38:20.965 --> 38:24.168
It'll keep happening
unless one of them stops it.

38:24.235 --> 38:27.738
You need to kick her out of bed.
I will, "Get out."

38:27.805 --> 38:31.142
Has she been noshing you off
for weeks? Two weeks.

38:31.208 --> 38:35.546
Gaz and Dan think I'm gonna
end up like James and Holly, no.

38:35.613 --> 38:38.749
Number one, I don't have
a fucking stupid comb-over.

38:38.816 --> 38:43.821
And two, I'm having way too much fun
to get tied down to any shit.

38:49.927 --> 38:53.064
So we're all getting ready
to go out.

38:53.130 --> 38:55.700
Are you excited for tonight?

38:55.766 --> 38:58.335
Yeah.
And the Cock Captures are no more?

38:58.402 --> 39:00.004
No, we still are,

39:00.071 --> 39:03.808
we're just giving it a rest
for a bit, we're tired.

39:03.874 --> 39:07.578
How about tonight, then,
you give being ladies a go?

39:07.645 --> 39:11.849
I want them to realise that having
a bit of respect for yourself,

39:11.916 --> 39:15.720
men will have respect for you,
and do more than fuck you,

39:15.786 --> 39:18.656
wipe their dick on the curtains
and fuck off.

39:18.723 --> 39:21.258
First of all, sit like a lady.

39:21.325 --> 39:25.463
I'm pretending to be a nice bloke,
good-looking with a big cock.

39:25.529 --> 39:29.533
"I've got a massive knob, you knaa,
it's the size of an aeroplane."

39:29.600 --> 39:31.602
I don't want to know that.

39:31.669 --> 39:35.172
"What about me mate as well?
He's got a big cock."

39:35.239 --> 39:40.344
(posh voice) First of all why don't
I know your friend's name? John.

39:40.411 --> 39:44.648
Being a lady is actually really hard.
It takes years of practice.

39:44.715 --> 39:49.220
I don't believe that anyone's truly
a lady until they're, like, 40.

39:49.286 --> 39:52.123
Are we set to go out now?
We're done.

39:52.189 --> 39:54.925
We've got more chance
of Gary settling down

39:54.992 --> 39:57.394
than these fucking halfwits
acting like ladies.

40:00.397 --> 40:04.702
We've all been the casino
and now we're heading out as a group.

40:04.769 --> 40:07.204
Spirits are high,
I can't fucking wait.

I wanna check she feels

40:35.399 --> 40:38.936
Me and Scott are just friends.
I don't want anything more.

40:39.003 --> 40:42.973
I know everybody thinks it's like me
and James but it isn't.

40:43.040 --> 40:46.477
I feel completely in control.
Sometimes something might happen,

40:46.544 --> 40:48.646
sometimes it won't.

in their whole new
ladylike endeavours

41:01.292 --> 41:05.129
and find them shaking their titties
at each other.

41:07.865 --> 41:10.100
I don't remember Kate Middleton
doing a titty-shake.

41:10.167 --> 41:14.605
I'm absolutely smashed but I'm
necking on, Charlotte hasn't reacted.

41:14.672 --> 41:19.476
She looks like she's having a good
night. This is very good news for me.

41:20.477 --> 41:25.182
So Gary has pulled.
He's brought a girl into our area

41:25.249 --> 41:27.651
but still I'm not bothered.

41:27.718 --> 41:30.187
I've got me best friends back.

41:30.254 --> 41:33.157
I was left out
when they were off pulling.

Because the Cock Capturers
have stopped cock capturing,

41:57.014 --> 42:00.985
the boys are now thinking
that they need to go all out.

42:01.051 --> 42:02.486
Is there any need?

42:02.553 --> 42:04.388

We've got a full house tonight,
three boys to four girls.

42:11.996 --> 42:14.899
It's like fucking
Grand Central Station in here.

42:14.965 --> 42:18.969
Thank God the girls
haven't pulled random boys.

42:19.036 --> 42:22.106
Instead Holly's spooning the floor

42:22.172 --> 42:24.308
and Charlotte's talking to the fish.

42:24.375 --> 42:26.277
Scramble, Scramble.

42:26.343 --> 42:28.646
Who needs cock?

42:28.712 --> 42:34.084
I can't wait to get these girls
upstairs, in bed, do the business.

42:34.151 --> 42:39.523
It's been a long night. I get two
girls back, get them in the shag pad.

42:39.590 --> 42:44.428
I could be on for two of them
but all they wanna do is talk.

42:47.564 --> 42:50.935
Two birds, no bang.
Sometimes you have a bad night.

girls is wailing like a banshee.

42:57.041 --> 43:01.545
(moans) Scott.

43:01.612 --> 43:05.182
It's put us off me stride.
I feel completely cock-blocked.

43:05.249 --> 43:06.517
It's not happening.

43:06.583 --> 43:12.623
