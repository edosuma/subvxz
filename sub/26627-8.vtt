00:16.891 --> 00:17.976
[Matt] <i>Who are you?</i>

00:19.185 --> 00:20.437
[Dex] <i>I'm Daredevil.</i>

00:21.479 --> 00:23.106
[man] <i>Hey, you can't be here!</i>

00:23.189 --> 00:24.149
[clamoring]

00:25.108 --> 00:26.067
[gunshot]

00:27.027 --> 00:29.738
[Dex] <i>Hello, Karen.</i>
<i>It's nice to see you again.</i>

00:35.118 --> 00:38.538
<i>I'm Daredevil. </i>[echoing]

00:48.048 --> 00:50.842
[Mercer over recording]
<i>Your internal compass isn't broken, Dex.</i>

00:50.925 --> 00:53.636
<i>It just works better</i>
<i>with a North Star to guide you.</i>

00:54.095 --> 00:55.555
[young Dex] <i>What if I can't find one?</i>

00:55.638 --> 00:57.724
[Mercer] <i>Then you'll rely</i>
<i>on our structure.</i>

00:57.807 --> 01:00.602
<i>A tidy physical space.</i>
<i>A disciplined vocation. </i>

01:00.685 --> 01:03.146
<i>You will build your life</i>
<i>on pillars of order.</i>

01:20.080 --> 01:22.082
[theme music playing]

02:33.319 --> 02:34.821
[Matt] <i>If you'd just wake the hell up</i>

02:34.904 --> 02:37.115
<i>instead of playing right</i>
<i>into Fisk's hands.</i>

02:37.198 --> 02:38.533
<i>He's using you...</i>

02:38.616 --> 02:40.034
-Morning.
-[Lim] Morning, boss.

02:40.118 --> 02:41.703
[Matt] <i>...and I think you know it.</i>

02:42.996 --> 02:45.456
<i>So let me ask you this, Agent Nadeem...</i> <i>Who do you think is the danger here? </i>

02:52.881 --> 02:56.134
<i>The man who attacked the </i>Bulletin
<i>dressed as Daredevil...</i>

02:56.217 --> 02:57.886
<i>he's in the FBI.</i>

03:00.346 --> 03:03.266
[Dex] <i>Hello, Karen.</i>
<i>It's nice to see you again.</i>

03:47.310 --> 03:48.311
[man] Hey!

03:49.979 --> 03:50.813
Julie!

03:51.731 --> 03:54.067
-Dex, stay away from me.
-Please, just hear me out.

03:54.150 --> 03:56.277
I'm doing this in public
so you'll feel safe.

03:56.361 --> 03:59.239
I'll stay right here.
I'm not coming any closer.

04:00.406 --> 04:01.407
Okay.

04:02.533 --> 04:06.746
I am so, so sorry
about how things ended the other night.

04:06.829 --> 04:10.083
I'm sorry for scaring you.
I just wanted to explain myself.

04:10.875 --> 04:13.670
When we worked together
at the suicide hotline,

04:13.753 --> 04:15.630
I saw the way you were with other people.

04:16.214 --> 04:19.467
Patient, compassionate, and I...

04:19.550 --> 04:21.219
[panting]

04:21.302 --> 04:22.887
I really need that right now.

04:23.721 --> 04:25.056
My life is out of control.

04:25.139 --> 04:28.643
I have no family,
and I'm about to lose my job...

04:28.726 --> 04:29.769
Please.

04:30.770 --> 04:33.189
I just want to talk. Anywhere you choose.
And...

04:34.315 --> 04:37.235
if you say no, I'll understand...

04:38.111 --> 04:39.737
and I'll never bother you again.

04:57.547 --> 04:58.589
[Matt] Agent Nadeem.

05:02.343 --> 05:03.344
You're late.

05:03.428 --> 05:05.388
I was early,
but I needed to be sure about you.

05:05.471 --> 05:06.472
What's his name?

05:06.556 --> 05:09.183
Yeah, well,
I need to be sure about you, too.

05:09.267 --> 05:12.228
You have a history of hurting people.
I'm not handing you a federal agent

05:12.312 --> 05:14.063
-if you're gonna kill him.
-I don't do that.

05:15.106 --> 05:19.360
The agents you beat up the other day?
One of them is still in the hospital.

05:19.444 --> 05:20.778
All of them just doing their jobs.

05:20.862 --> 05:23.114
If they'd arrested me,
there'd be no one to take down Fisk.

05:23.197 --> 05:25.867
If you're right about him,
taking Fisk down is our job.

05:25.950 --> 05:27.160
Oh, really?

05:27.243 --> 05:29.954
Because we both know
where he's sleeping these days.

05:30.997 --> 05:32.081
But I understand.

05:32.165 --> 05:35.460
If there's one thing we agree on, Nadeem,
it's the greater good.

05:35.543 --> 05:38.129
Like house incarceration
in exchange for good intel.

05:38.212 --> 05:41.382
Sometimes you and I have to hurt
one person to save another.

05:42.008 --> 05:43.217
So what's his name?

05:46.554 --> 05:48.264
I need your word that you won't touch him.

05:48.348 --> 05:50.516
My word can't mean anything to you.

05:50.600 --> 05:52.435
But I need to hear you give it.

05:53.770 --> 05:57.398
Well, I need him to testify against Fisk,
so you got it.

06:01.944 --> 06:04.197
We're gonna slip into his place.

06:04.280 --> 06:07.992
Look for any evidence that ties him
to the <i>Bulletin</i> attack or to Fisk.

06:08.618 --> 06:11.204
If we find any, we leave it where it is.

06:12.080 --> 06:14.248
And we set off his fire alarm
on our way out.

06:14.332 --> 06:17.460
The fire department arrives,
and you circumvent a search warrant.

06:17.543 --> 06:19.170
But if we don't find anything,

06:19.253 --> 06:21.130
-the guy goes on with his life.
-Spit it out.

06:21.214 --> 06:22.507
Who is he?

06:24.509 --> 06:27.136
Special Agent Ben Poindexter.

06:31.182 --> 06:33.810
A small decaf and whatever she's having.

06:33.893 --> 06:36.187
I've got mine. Thanks.

06:36.270 --> 06:38.272
-My regular, Richie.
-[Richie] All right.

06:39.607 --> 06:44.779
So, I don't know how to say this
without it sounding like an insult.

06:44.862 --> 06:47.240
I was never actually into you.

06:47.323 --> 06:50.201
Or... not the way you might have
been thinking, anyway.

06:50.284 --> 06:52.537
I didn't know how to talk to you.

06:53.162 --> 06:54.163
Okay.

06:54.705 --> 06:55.832
I wasn't...

06:57.166 --> 06:59.085
I wasn't stalking you.

06:59.168 --> 07:03.923
Although, I completely see
how it could have come across that way.

07:04.006 --> 07:07.510
I just... I wanted to be more like you.

07:10.096 --> 07:12.265
Do you realize
how creepy that still sounds?

07:19.897 --> 07:24.735
You are so good.

07:25.403 --> 07:28.614
And kind. And...

07:28.698 --> 07:31.284
You save lives as your job.

07:33.369 --> 07:36.539
The FBI, the army before that...

07:37.123 --> 07:39.709
they helped keep me
on the straight and narrow path.

07:40.293 --> 07:44.297
But now, without that, it's all... [sighs]

07:44.380 --> 07:46.757
I'm drowning in deep water,

07:46.841 --> 07:50.303
and I don't know whether I'm swimming
for the surface or the bottom.

07:50.386 --> 07:51.429
[breathes deeply]

07:51.512 --> 07:54.474
Dex, you need air. Breathe.

08:02.607 --> 08:05.151
See, that's...
that's what I'm talking about.

08:06.110 --> 08:08.321
You help people right themselves. I've seen you do it a hundred times.

08:10.698 --> 08:16.454
All I'm asking, just treat me like...
someone on the other end of the line.

08:20.166 --> 08:22.001
What happened at the FBI?

08:23.961 --> 08:26.047
The bureau needed a scapegoat.

08:28.508 --> 08:29.550
[imitates bleating]

08:31.636 --> 08:32.470
[chuckles]

08:33.638 --> 08:35.681
[both chuckle]

08:35.765 --> 08:36.807
[Dex groans]

08:37.433 --> 08:39.936
You know, what you really need
is a good therapist.

08:42.396 --> 08:44.982
I had one. She died.

08:46.484 --> 08:47.318
Oh, I...

08:48.528 --> 08:49.654
I'm so sorry.

08:55.034 --> 08:57.578
Okay. I'll help you, Dex.

08:59.205 --> 09:01.916
But, please, do not make me regret this.

09:02.667 --> 09:06.712
I promise. Promise I will not.

09:08.005 --> 09:09.840
[cell phone vibrating]

09:09.924 --> 09:11.342
Excuse me.

09:23.896 --> 09:25.356
[knock on door]

09:30.820 --> 09:32.613
[Foggy] Hi. Whoa!

09:32.697 --> 09:35.157
-Did you get any sleep at all?
-Yeah.

09:35.241 --> 09:36.075
No.

09:39.370 --> 09:41.080
-You need coffee.
-Yeah.

09:42.790 --> 09:45.626
You ever have one of those days
where you're just, like...

09:45.710 --> 09:49.171
You break it down, step by step?
Just, uh...

09:50.172 --> 09:54.010
"Put your feet on the floor, Karen.
Just get to the sink."

09:55.761 --> 09:56.762
Sure.

09:56.846 --> 09:59.682
Generally speaking,
I don't call myself Karen, but...

09:59.765 --> 10:02.310
Actually, no, I don't do any of that.

10:02.393 --> 10:03.227
[Karen scoffs]

10:05.104 --> 10:07.106
How are you not at the bottom
of a bottle right now?

10:07.189 --> 10:08.566
Because I have a theory.

10:09.233 --> 10:10.818
Jeez. Must be a hell of a theory.

10:11.569 --> 10:14.071
Fisk is giving up criminals
involved in corruption.

10:14.155 --> 10:15.531
He's planning to step into the void

10:15.615 --> 10:17.617
and become the sole source
of government protection

10:17.700 --> 10:20.161
for all criminals in Hell's Kitchen,
maybe the city.

10:20.244 --> 10:22.872
And that theory
makes you want to not drink?

10:24.123 --> 10:26.917
Yes, because I also have a plan.

10:27.001 --> 10:30.004
No. No, no, Foggy, you don't have a plan.

10:30.546 --> 10:32.298
Do you know what happens
when you make a plan?

10:32.381 --> 10:34.967
Fisk has already thought of it,
and he's made it part of his plan.

10:35.051 --> 10:38.721
Except he has no idea that I'm onto him.
He couldn't.

10:38.804 --> 10:41.515
I discovered this
while looking into Marci's briefs.

10:41.599 --> 10:42.600
More ways than one.

10:42.683 --> 10:44.477
-[groans] Foggy.
-Sorry.

10:44.560 --> 10:48.314
The point is she was prepping
for a deposition of a corrupt IRS official

10:48.397 --> 10:50.441
who was providing
fraud and money laundering services

10:50.524 --> 10:52.068
-for the Albanians--
-No, stop.

10:53.611 --> 10:54.779
I can't.

10:59.325 --> 11:03.120
Just one more article, Karen.
That's all it'll take.

11:06.374 --> 11:08.584
[sighs] All right. What's this?

11:08.668 --> 11:10.836
The terms of Fisk's house incarceration.

11:10.920 --> 11:15.091
If he violates any of these, zappo.
He's back in prison.

11:15.174 --> 11:17.093
"Zappo"? Is that a thing?

11:17.927 --> 11:19.345
Number three is the key.

11:20.137 --> 11:22.223
"Committing or conspiring
to commit a felony."

11:22.306 --> 11:24.850
No, no, wait. What about number six here?

11:24.934 --> 11:27.853
All this stuff about being charged
with a crime that predates the agreement?

11:27.937 --> 11:30.314
-Number six is not the plan.
-We have a good number six.

11:31.107 --> 11:33.943
I mean, Fisk killed his father.
That's murder.

11:34.026 --> 11:36.987
There's no statute of limitations.
And his mother told Ben Urich about it.

11:37.071 --> 11:38.906
A dead woman told a dead guy something.

11:38.989 --> 11:42.451
-That's not proof. It won't stick.
-[sighs] Yeah.

11:42.535 --> 11:45.621
You know what will? Publicizing my theory.

11:45.705 --> 11:47.998
So the FBI sees
that Fisk has violated his agreement,

11:48.082 --> 11:49.709
they're forced to put him back in prison?

11:49.792 --> 11:53.254
And they can't ignore it
if we splash it across the front page.

11:53.337 --> 11:54.588
And by "we," I mean you.

11:54.672 --> 11:57.425
The <i>Bulletin</i> won't just let a journalist
make unsubstantiated claims.

11:57.508 --> 11:58.509
That's not news.

11:58.592 --> 12:00.928
But it is news if a candidate
running for district attorney

12:01.011 --> 12:02.555
makes unsubstantiated claims.

12:02.638 --> 12:06.016
In a public forum.
Debating the incumbent DA.

12:06.684 --> 12:08.310
You're gonna debate Blake Tower?

12:08.394 --> 12:09.729
At the Hell's Kitchen Club.

12:09.812 --> 12:12.314
Well, it's supposed to be
prepared remarks.

12:12.398 --> 12:14.191
-Huh.
-They're endorsing him.

12:14.275 --> 12:15.818
I'm not actually on the agenda,

12:15.901 --> 12:18.154
but Nelson's Meats
is a member of the club, so...

12:18.237 --> 12:20.156
You're just gonna confront him,
out of the blue?

12:20.239 --> 12:22.742
Why not?
I'll catch him when he's not expecting it.

12:22.825 --> 12:24.118
Throw this stuff at him--

12:24.201 --> 12:27.204
Yeah, you get him worked up, emotional.
Provoke him.

12:28.831 --> 12:29.832
It could work. Yup.

12:33.836 --> 12:36.172
So, you'll cover the meeting?

12:37.465 --> 12:39.300
Yeah, I would. I just, um...

12:41.260 --> 12:43.554
I lost my job. So...

12:44.638 --> 12:45.639
What?

12:46.891 --> 12:49.977
Ellison loves you like family.
What did you do?

12:51.771 --> 12:54.398
I refused to give him
Daredevil's identity.

12:55.983 --> 12:56.817
Yikes.

12:56.901 --> 13:01.238
Okay, well,
Ellison wants Fisk as badly as we do.

13:01.322 --> 13:04.784
Just tell him our plan.
Watch how fast he gives you your job back.

13:04.867 --> 13:08.037
Then we'll hook up at the dinner later.
You're my plus one.

13:09.288 --> 13:10.581
I got you the salmon.

13:28.057 --> 13:30.309
<i>Hey. Did the landlord let you in?</i>

13:50.955 --> 13:53.541
[indistinct chatter]

13:58.003 --> 13:59.004
Dex.

14:00.589 --> 14:01.715
Thanks for coming.

14:02.383 --> 14:05.970
You made it pretty clear I had to.
What's this about?

14:07.012 --> 14:08.973
I have someone here
who wants to talk to you.

14:10.266 --> 14:11.433
Follow me.

14:29.660 --> 14:32.705
Dex, this is my old friend Andrea Morales.

14:34.331 --> 14:35.833
She's an attorney.

14:36.417 --> 14:39.336
The guys took up a collection
to pay for Andy's services.

14:39.420 --> 14:41.630
Now if you're up for it,

14:41.714 --> 14:44.967
she's going to sue the bureau
for wrongful suspension on your behalf.

14:45.050 --> 14:47.303
-She can do that?
-[Morales] I can.

14:47.386 --> 14:49.305
And having reviewed
the details of your case,

14:49.388 --> 14:51.181
I fully believe that I should.

14:52.266 --> 14:54.643
She's on a retainer. Starting now.

14:54.727 --> 14:55.811
And I'm not cheap.

14:55.895 --> 14:58.689
The guys must really like you,
Agent Poindexter.

15:01.317 --> 15:03.694
You've had my back through all this?

15:04.695 --> 15:06.071
I don't know how to thank you.

15:07.406 --> 15:11.410
The guy that saved our lives doesn't
ever have to thank us for anything.

15:14.747 --> 15:17.082
Well, figure out the next steps,
and, uh...

15:18.626 --> 15:20.544
I can't wait to have you back on the team.

15:23.756 --> 15:25.215
I've prepared the argument.

16:33.534 --> 16:35.494
-[Ray] You find anything?
-[door closes]

16:35.577 --> 16:38.080
[Matt] He's neat. He likes order.

16:39.039 --> 16:41.667
So does my wife,
but she wouldn't fit in your suit.

16:45.254 --> 16:48.382
Everything I have on Dex
is circumstantial at best.

16:49.299 --> 16:51.176
I just left him. He was solid.

16:52.845 --> 16:56.265
I don't see a decorated agent
falling for Fisk's bullshit.

16:56.348 --> 16:58.267
Yeah, well, that's what Fisk does.

16:58.809 --> 17:00.644
Finds a weakness. Hits it hard.

17:01.520 --> 17:02.896
When you're already on your knees,

17:02.980 --> 17:05.190
you've got no choice
but to fall for his bullshit.

17:06.984 --> 17:09.361
I bet you guys are paying
for his room service, too.

17:20.497 --> 17:23.083
The suit's here. I can smell it.

17:23.167 --> 17:24.960
What, you can smell it?

17:27.838 --> 17:29.506
[Matt] GSR and latex.

17:33.135 --> 17:35.012
Shit. I can't call a crew to crack that.

17:40.768 --> 17:42.102
What, you can do that?

17:42.186 --> 17:44.646
[Matt] Not if you keep talking, I can't.

18:05.834 --> 18:08.545
The suit was here. He must've moved it.

18:09.588 --> 18:11.090
Well, it isn't now.

18:11.882 --> 18:14.802
And you smelling eau de suit
won't exactly sway a judge.

18:14.885 --> 18:18.097
I'm telling you, Poindexter's the guy.
It was him.

18:19.139 --> 18:22.017
There's nothing here tying him
to Fisk or the <i>Bulletin.</i>

18:24.603 --> 18:25.938
We got jack shit.

18:34.571 --> 18:36.615
[young Dex]<i> When the crows</i>
<i>come to the birdfeeder,</i>

18:36.698 --> 18:38.367
<i>I kill them with rocks.</i>

18:39.409 --> 18:41.870
[Mercer]<i> What does it feel like</i>
<i>to watch them die?</i>

18:42.287 --> 18:45.332
[Morales] It probably won't even get
as far as an arbitration.

18:45.415 --> 18:47.626
The government tends to balk
once folks lawyer up.

18:47.709 --> 18:51.255
[chuckles] This is amazing.
How long do you think this will take?

18:51.338 --> 18:55.676
If we do everything right,
you'll be reinstated in six months.

18:55.759 --> 18:58.387
-Six months?
-But we'll get you back pay.

18:59.138 --> 19:00.889
I don't care about back pay.

19:02.015 --> 19:03.892
What am I going to do for six months?

19:03.976 --> 19:06.228
I know it seems like a stretch,

19:06.311 --> 19:09.189
but you've got a bright future
ahead of you in the bureau.

19:09.773 --> 19:11.191
Play the long game.

19:11.900 --> 19:14.027
[cell phone vibrating]

19:15.028 --> 19:16.363
Oh. I'll be right back.

19:49.479 --> 19:51.481
[breathing heavily]

19:53.525 --> 19:54.776
[line ringing]

19:56.361 --> 19:58.197
[automated voice]
<i>This number has been blocked.</i>

19:58.280 --> 19:59.573
[call disconnects]

20:07.122 --> 20:08.999
[Mercer]<i> Have you been</i>
<i>doing our exercises?</i>

20:10.000 --> 20:15.464
[young Dex]<i> Yes, but then the neighbor</i>
<i>brought home a box of stray kittens.</i>

20:16.006 --> 20:17.132
<i>They were in the yard.</i>

20:20.052 --> 20:22.221
<i>I killed them with rocks, Dr. Mercer.</i>

20:23.889 --> 20:26.934
<i>I tried not to, but I liked it.</i>

20:28.018 --> 20:30.812
[distant footsteps approaching faintly]

20:31.813 --> 20:35.150
So the guy has issues. Serious issues.
But that doesn't mean...

20:44.159 --> 20:45.869
[Matt] He's here. You should go.

20:45.953 --> 20:48.705
No, we had a deal.
No evidence, you don't touch him.

20:48.789 --> 20:51.208
-[Matt] I found evidence.
-The kind that holds up in court.

20:51.291 --> 20:52.668
He's gonna use the suit again.

20:52.751 --> 20:55.545
I got the jump on him.
I can get him to tell me where it is.

20:55.629 --> 20:59.007
-[Ray] You gave me your word.
-[Matt] Yeah, well, I take it back.

22:02.279 --> 22:04.781
-We'll never get another chance like that.
-What if you're wrong?

22:04.865 --> 22:06.575
-I'm not wrong.
-[gun cocking]

22:10.704 --> 22:11.705
[Ray groans]

22:20.255 --> 22:22.924
The shot came from across
the alley. [groans]

22:23.008 --> 22:24.926
I think it came from downstairs.

22:27.888 --> 22:29.639
[gunshot, ricochet]

22:32.351 --> 22:35.020
He's... He's ricocheting the bullets.

22:36.813 --> 22:38.982
-[Ray] Go for the front door.
-[Matt] He's by the window.

22:39.066 --> 22:40.359
He's waiting for a better shot.

22:41.276 --> 22:42.277
How do you know?

22:44.321 --> 22:45.238
[gunshot]

22:51.078 --> 22:53.038
He's only got three more rounds.

22:53.121 --> 22:54.915
I'll tell you when he reloads,
and then you go.

22:54.998 --> 22:56.708
[panting] Okay.

22:58.794 --> 23:02.089
-He's not calling for backup.
-No. And he won't.

23:02.172 --> 23:03.632
But the neighbor called 911.

23:08.220 --> 23:09.304
God damn it, Dex.

23:09.388 --> 23:10.263
[gunshots]

23:12.599 --> 23:13.850
Okay, now. Go, go, go!

23:28.407 --> 23:29.282
[Dex grunts]

23:47.676 --> 23:50.178
[dispatcher over radio]
<i>Third floor, 2312 King Street.</i>

23:50.262 --> 23:52.097
<i>Two suspects, violent.</i>

23:53.223 --> 23:55.976
[officer 1 over radio]
<i>Roger that, dispatch. 2312 King Street...</i>

24:04.693 --> 24:06.194
[officer 2] Police! Hands in the air!

24:18.123 --> 24:19.958
I'm FBI. I have ID.

24:20.959 --> 24:23.753
If you look in my pocket,
you'll find my wallet.

24:25.964 --> 24:28.216
Two armed suspects broke into my home.

24:33.847 --> 24:36.057
[young Dex]<i> ...tried not to, but I liked--</i>

25:21.478 --> 25:24.814
All right, all right,
everybody, settle down.

25:24.898 --> 25:27.192
We're getting to the good part
of the evening.

25:27.275 --> 25:28.527
[man] You mean dessert?

25:28.610 --> 25:29.778
[crowd laughing]

25:29.861 --> 25:32.781
[speaker] As if you need
another freakin' cannoli, Mikey!

25:32.864 --> 25:34.241
[crowd laughing]

25:34.324 --> 25:36.409
[speaker] Our agenda tonight is simple.

25:36.493 --> 25:39.037
Our endorsement of a candidate
for district attorney...

25:39.120 --> 25:40.747
[on recording]<i> It's Karen.</i>
<i>You know what to do.</i>

25:40.830 --> 25:43.375
Karen? Where the hell are you?

25:43.458 --> 25:44.417
[elevator dings]

25:47.254 --> 25:48.421
[metal detector beeps]

25:48.505 --> 25:51.466
-How did you get up here?
-I checked into a room.

25:51.550 --> 25:53.009
This floor FBI is personnel only.

25:53.093 --> 25:54.970
Hi, I'm Karen Page. I'm with the <i>Bulletin.</i>

25:55.053 --> 25:55.971
We know who you are.

25:56.054 --> 25:57.597
Well, I'd like to talk to him.

25:57.681 --> 25:59.099
[Lim] Not gonna happen.

25:59.182 --> 26:02.852
[scoffs] Under his agreement,
he's entitled to speak to the press.

26:02.936 --> 26:05.522
Unless you two wanna
make the call to violate that?

26:05.605 --> 26:08.358
Fisk and his lawyers have to sign off
on all press requests.

26:08.441 --> 26:12.320
They tell all you people to screw off.
You're wasting your time.

26:12.404 --> 26:15.198
All right.
Well, why don't you call his lawyers

26:15.282 --> 26:17.701
and tell them I want to give
Mr. Fisk a chance to comment

26:17.784 --> 26:20.412
on a story that I'm writing
about a Marlene Vistain?

26:21.246 --> 26:22.581
That's Fisk's mother.

26:22.664 --> 26:23.665
Shit.

26:24.457 --> 26:25.667
He actually had one?

26:27.627 --> 26:30.338
Go ahead. Call his lawyers. I'll wait.

26:35.510 --> 26:37.345
[Tower] Prosecutions
aren't the whole story.

26:37.429 --> 26:39.764
The vast majority of our caseload
never sees a jury,

26:39.848 --> 26:44.811
because we bring such strong cases to bear
that defendants plead guilty voluntarily.

26:44.894 --> 26:48.189
Which means more bad guys in jail
for less money.

26:48.273 --> 26:50.066
Something we all can agree on?

26:55.739 --> 26:59.367
Until you let them out of prison again.
Isn't that right, Mr. Tower?

26:59.451 --> 27:03.705
Because you sign off
on both kinds of deals, don't you, sir?

27:03.788 --> 27:05.415
Is that Foggy Nelson?

27:05.498 --> 27:06.541
Uh...

27:06.625 --> 27:07.959
Sure is, Mr. Gerlach.

27:08.043 --> 27:09.878
What are you doing, Foggy?

27:09.961 --> 27:13.340
I told your girlfriend if you ain't
on the ballot, you can't speak.

27:13.423 --> 27:17.552
But the Nelsons are members, too,
and this is an endorsement meeting.

27:17.636 --> 27:19.596
Members can ask questions,
isn't that right?

27:19.679 --> 27:21.890
It ain't gonna change the vote, Foggy.

27:21.973 --> 27:24.684
You're just holding up dessert
and pissing people off.

27:24.768 --> 27:25.894
[crowd laughing]

27:25.977 --> 27:29.022
I apologize to everyone.
This won't take long.

27:29.105 --> 27:30.732
Said every lawyer ever.

27:30.815 --> 27:32.859
[laughter]

27:32.942 --> 27:35.904
We can be long-winded, sure.
But I'm not billing anyone for this.

27:37.447 --> 27:40.492
I'm running my own
write-in campaign for DA.

27:40.575 --> 27:42.118
Most of you know that by now.

27:42.661 --> 27:44.621
I'm not running 'cause I expect to win.

27:45.246 --> 27:47.999
I'm running to hold him accountable.

27:48.083 --> 27:50.210
Debate is the soul of democracy.

27:50.794 --> 27:53.588
So why aren't you talking
about Wilson Fisk?

27:53.672 --> 27:55.465
Are you running for office, Mr. Tower,

27:55.548 --> 27:58.593
or are you running away
from responsibility for his situation?

27:59.761 --> 28:01.429
We've been here before, Mr. Nelson.

28:01.513 --> 28:05.225
Do you still claim to have no influence
over his release from prison

28:05.308 --> 28:07.185
to live among us here in the city again?

28:07.268 --> 28:10.355
The powers of my office
are limited to state law.

28:10.438 --> 28:13.692
Wilson Fisk's situation is
entirely under federal jurisdiction and--

28:13.775 --> 28:15.944
[Foggy] You mean crimes
he's already been sentenced for?

28:16.027 --> 28:16.861
Of course.

28:16.945 --> 28:21.616
But you can prosecute for crimes
he's committing right now, can't you?

28:21.700 --> 28:22.742
What crimes?

28:22.826 --> 28:25.829
The man is locked up in FBI custody
24 hours a day.

28:26.913 --> 28:28.915
In a five-star hotel.

28:28.998 --> 28:31.251
Because he made a deal with the feds.

28:31.334 --> 28:36.047
Living in luxury as long as he gives up
major underworld figures.

28:36.131 --> 28:39.843
Which Fisk has done, time and again,
making this city safer.

28:39.926 --> 28:42.679
Or making his competition disappear.

28:43.972 --> 28:45.014
That's right.

28:46.349 --> 28:50.687
Wilson Fisk is informing
on carefully-selected targets.

28:50.770 --> 28:53.940
Using the government as his private army

28:54.023 --> 28:58.278
to reclaim his position at the center
of this city's criminal underworld.

28:58.361 --> 28:59.362
This is fantasy.

28:59.446 --> 29:02.741
No, it's a harsh reality.

29:04.576 --> 29:08.705
There are government officials
who are controlled by various criminals.

29:08.788 --> 29:10.290
What Wilson Fisk has done

29:10.373 --> 29:13.209
is take all those criminals
and turn them over to the FBI.

29:13.293 --> 29:16.504
And keep all those corrupt officials
for himself.

29:17.088 --> 29:23.595
He's planning to turn himself into a
one-stop shop for bribery and protection.

29:23.678 --> 29:25.722
It's all right here.

29:25.805 --> 29:27.182
[Tower] Mr. Nelson.

29:27.265 --> 29:30.977
As district attorney,
you can't just pander to a crowd.

29:31.060 --> 29:32.771
You have to prove your case.

29:32.854 --> 29:34.773
-I can.
-[Tower] No, you can't.

29:34.856 --> 29:35.857
My turn.

29:36.649 --> 29:40.320
At your fancy law firm,
what they teach is, "Create a fiction."

29:40.904 --> 29:43.531
What story does a jury need to hear?
Not what facts.

29:44.073 --> 29:46.451
I have been prosecuting for 13 years,

29:46.534 --> 29:49.454
and I can tell you
this is not how criminal law works.

29:49.537 --> 29:53.374
Moving speeches impress a crowd,
but they don't stand up in criminal court.

29:54.459 --> 29:56.836
I don't have your experience, Mr. Tower.

29:57.754 --> 29:59.380
It's true. But then again,

30:00.173 --> 30:04.636
I'm not jaded from doing the same thing
for too many years, either.

30:04.719 --> 30:07.555
I'm still passionate
about what the law can do.

30:08.348 --> 30:10.975
And that's a very powerful tool
to work with.

30:11.893 --> 30:14.604
Because when you get beyond the cold facts

30:14.687 --> 30:17.816
and really get worked up
about what you're doing, you can...

30:22.362 --> 30:23.363
Holy shit.

30:23.446 --> 30:25.156
I can't hear you.

30:25.240 --> 30:28.660
You can do what, Mr. Nelson?
Freeze up in front of a jury?

30:28.743 --> 30:30.453
[Tower laughing]

30:41.756 --> 30:42.799
[Karen scoffs]

30:43.508 --> 30:44.759
We'll be watching.

30:51.099 --> 30:51.933
[door closes]

30:52.016 --> 30:53.476
You gotta be kidding me.

31:12.287 --> 31:13.496
[Fisk] Ms. Page.

31:22.213 --> 31:26.384
I must admit, I'm surprised you're here.

31:30.889 --> 31:33.516
I suppose this qualifies as hard time?

31:33.600 --> 31:36.811
Yes, I'm sure all of this
is offensive to you,

31:37.353 --> 31:39.314
given our personal history.

31:41.733 --> 31:43.651
You mean the times
you tried to have me killed?

31:45.278 --> 31:47.488
Crimes for which I'm still paying.

31:48.948 --> 31:51.910
Yes. It's offensive.

32:01.294 --> 32:02.295
Tea?

32:04.631 --> 32:05.715
No, thank you.

32:06.966 --> 32:08.468
I'm not here for tea.

32:20.855 --> 32:21.856
Sit down.

32:23.816 --> 32:26.361
You came for words, at least.

32:28.321 --> 32:29.322
Yeah.

32:31.366 --> 32:33.117
Let's-- Let's have some words.

32:44.253 --> 32:46.798
You are not writing
an article about my mother.

32:49.801 --> 32:50.802
I'm not?

32:55.348 --> 32:56.432
I could.

32:56.516 --> 32:58.184
To what end, Ms. Page?

32:58.851 --> 33:00.436
My distress?

33:01.020 --> 33:02.146
[Karen] Hmm.

33:02.230 --> 33:04.774
Doesn't actually sound that bad,
now that you say it.

33:05.358 --> 33:09.195
I do not welcome intrusions
into my privacy.

33:09.821 --> 33:11.489
Yet you invited me in?

33:12.907 --> 33:17.578
You worked for Ben Urich, didn't you?

33:17.662 --> 33:19.288
I believe he mentored you.

33:19.372 --> 33:21.332
Yes, before he was murdered.

33:22.000 --> 33:25.962
A final lesson.
One you seem not to have understood.

33:27.380 --> 33:28.464
Is that a threat?

33:29.298 --> 33:31.009
It's an observation.

33:33.845 --> 33:35.263
Well, you're right.

33:37.265 --> 33:39.600
I'm not here to talk about your mother.

33:41.602 --> 33:43.980
I'd rather talk about what she told Ben.

33:46.065 --> 33:49.610
Actually, really,
rather, what she told us.

33:52.655 --> 33:56.701
See, I don't think you know,
but I was with him.

33:57.618 --> 33:59.203
It probably wasn't fair.

33:59.287 --> 34:04.167
Two trained journalists
working on a feeble old woman like that.

34:06.502 --> 34:07.837
It's easy to push her.

34:09.255 --> 34:11.174
Get her to say things she doesn't want to.

34:11.799 --> 34:12.800
Your point?

34:14.093 --> 34:16.637
She remembered a lot about your childhood.

34:16.721 --> 34:21.267
They say the oldest memories
stick around the longest.

34:22.393 --> 34:26.981
She remembered a lot of little things.
A lot of... embarrassing things.

34:28.024 --> 34:32.403
Seems like there were a lot of those,
weren't there, Willie?

34:36.199 --> 34:40.411
I'm sure your readers at the <i>Bulletin</i>
will be as entertained as you are.

34:41.120 --> 34:43.873
No, we would never print those.

34:43.956 --> 34:46.125
We just pass them around the office.

34:47.376 --> 34:49.378
How is it around your office?

34:52.924 --> 34:54.717
I heard about your misfortune.

34:54.801 --> 34:57.303
Before it even happened, I'm sure.

34:58.221 --> 35:00.181
No, the story that we will print

35:00.264 --> 35:03.059
is her very detailed description
of your father.

35:03.142 --> 35:05.144
And how you murdered him.

35:05.228 --> 35:06.104
[inhales sharply]

35:06.938 --> 35:08.564
A hammer. At that age?

35:15.196 --> 35:19.951
Is there any part of you
that isn't broken, I wonder?

35:27.250 --> 35:28.960
[inhales deeply]

35:32.213 --> 35:33.673
[exhales deeply]

35:40.304 --> 35:41.722
[Fisk sighs]

35:49.981 --> 35:53.734
You asked me why I let you in.

35:55.403 --> 35:59.323
The reason is, Ms. Page,
I have a few questions of my own.

35:59.407 --> 36:01.868
You are a respected journalist,

36:01.951 --> 36:06.247
but at one time you were
merely a secretary at a law firm.

36:06.330 --> 36:08.249
To Matt Murdock, yes?

36:08.332 --> 36:09.458
Office manager.

36:09.542 --> 36:12.587
Intimately involved in his affairs, huh?

36:12.670 --> 36:14.255
His business affairs.

36:14.338 --> 36:15.506
Of course.

36:15.590 --> 36:21.762
Tell me, so at what point did you learn
about Mr. Murdock's secret life?

36:28.060 --> 36:29.061
Yeah.

36:29.896 --> 36:31.105
Thank you.

36:32.064 --> 36:33.691
Thank you, Ms. Page.

36:43.159 --> 36:44.160
[softly] Okay. Okay.

36:48.497 --> 36:49.874
You want secrets?

36:51.292 --> 36:53.294
I can tell you a secret, Wilson.

36:53.377 --> 36:56.255
Okay if I call you that? I feel like
we know each other well enough by now.

36:56.339 --> 36:58.174
-[Fisk] As you wish, Karen.
-Great.

37:00.468 --> 37:02.220
James Wesley.

37:05.264 --> 37:08.517
What was it like for you
when he disappeared?

37:10.353 --> 37:14.357
Really, it's those first 24 hours
that are the worst, aren't they?

37:15.358 --> 37:19.028
When you call and you call and you call,
and there's just no answer.

37:19.111 --> 37:20.780
It becomes an obsession.

37:22.865 --> 37:27.787
The calling. The never-ending loop
of a ghost's voice mail in your ear.

37:28.913 --> 37:29.914
You worry.

37:31.040 --> 37:32.083
You wonder.

37:32.708 --> 37:34.335
You swear, "God damn it,

37:34.418 --> 37:36.420
if he's still living,
I'm gonna kill him myself."

37:39.257 --> 37:40.800
Is that what it was like for you?

37:40.883 --> 37:42.385
Did you rage at him?

37:43.177 --> 37:45.179
'Cause you thought he betrayed you?

37:45.263 --> 37:47.098
Because I wonder
what would be worse for you. His duplicity or his death?

37:49.100 --> 37:51.644
[Fisk breathing shakily]

37:54.689 --> 37:56.649
[softly] He died quickly.

37:57.233 --> 37:58.901
If you were wondering.

37:59.944 --> 38:01.529
Didn't suffer much.

38:02.363 --> 38:06.784
You see, Wilson, Matt Murdock isn't
the person you should be worried about.

38:08.160 --> 38:09.662
I killed Wesley.

38:11.289 --> 38:14.208
I shot him seven times.

38:14.292 --> 38:17.378
Because the clip ran out.
He deserved more.

38:18.296 --> 38:19.297
[yells]

38:19.839 --> 38:20.756
[Wellers] Don't move!

38:21.674 --> 38:23.426
[yells and groans]

38:24.135 --> 38:25.136
What? What?

38:34.770 --> 38:35.813
Foggy?

38:41.068 --> 38:42.320
Think of it as a compliment.

38:42.403 --> 38:44.530
That they actually thought
I would try to kill him?

38:44.613 --> 38:46.699
-I had to tell them something.
-No, Foggy, you didn't.

38:47.533 --> 38:49.243
You ruined it. I had him.

38:49.327 --> 38:51.829
Had him? Fisk would snap you like a twig.

38:51.912 --> 38:53.497
At least they'd have it on video.

38:55.791 --> 38:57.126
Was that really your plan?

38:58.044 --> 39:01.380
God damn it, Karen.
Don't turn into Matt on me.

39:05.009 --> 39:08.637
Look, I didn't want him to kill me.
Just come after me.

39:08.721 --> 39:10.514
Oh, good.

39:11.724 --> 39:14.518
-Well, I got the idea from you.
-Me?

39:14.602 --> 39:16.896
All that talk about Tower
and catching him off guard,

39:16.979 --> 39:20.149
and I thought, "Yeah,
just get Fisk to stop thinking

39:20.232 --> 39:22.193
and reacting emotionally instead."

39:22.985 --> 39:25.363
I figured you were thinking
something like that.

39:25.905 --> 39:27.865
Not a bad plan, actually.

39:27.948 --> 39:30.868
Except for the part
where you have to hope the FBI comes in

39:30.951 --> 39:32.620
before that monster beats you to death.

39:32.703 --> 39:34.830
-Well, it doesn't matter now, does it?
-[elevator dings]

39:36.165 --> 39:37.833
How did you even know I was here?

39:38.459 --> 39:39.668
I know you.

39:39.752 --> 39:41.087
When you didn't come...

39:41.962 --> 39:45.883
I thought of some possibilities
and this was my nightmare scenario.

39:45.966 --> 39:47.593
So I pretty much counted on it.

39:48.386 --> 39:50.012
At least I took my shot.

39:50.096 --> 39:51.263
You took a shot.

39:51.847 --> 39:54.266
Tomorrow, there's gonna be
an army shooting back.

39:58.771 --> 40:01.107
The report, for your insurance.

40:01.732 --> 40:02.817
Thank you.

41:47.338 --> 41:48.672
[knock on door] Come with me.

42:02.353 --> 42:04.563
Yeah, yeah, another late one.

42:05.814 --> 42:09.693
I know, babe, but they're filing charges
against the Albanians tomorrow,

42:09.777 --> 42:12.238
and I never reviewed my account.

42:13.906 --> 42:16.325
Yeah, I'm not gonna make it home tonight.

42:19.370 --> 42:20.913
Kiss Sami for me.

42:23.165 --> 42:24.291
I love you, too.

42:42.560 --> 42:45.271
[breathing heavily]

42:51.068 --> 42:51.902
[grunts]

43:15.217 --> 43:16.885
[line ringing]

43:20.306 --> 43:21.307
Boss. Nadeem.

43:23.767 --> 43:25.144
Sorry to wake you.

43:27.980 --> 43:29.315
We need to talk.

44:01.764 --> 44:03.140
[elevator dings]

44:26.705 --> 44:27.706
After you.

44:41.178 --> 44:44.264
This was here the whole time?

44:44.348 --> 44:45.349
[Fisk] Yes. We, um...

44:52.314 --> 44:53.482
I have a problem.

44:54.817 --> 44:56.318
Nadeem knows.

44:56.402 --> 44:57.736
I know he does.

44:58.821 --> 45:01.240
We will take care of the problem.

45:09.123 --> 45:10.165
Dex...

45:12.835 --> 45:15.295
rage cannot stay inside.

45:17.131 --> 45:22.177
It needs to go somewhere...
or it becomes a poison.

45:22.261 --> 45:24.388
It will kill you from within.

45:24.471 --> 45:30.060
I find that when this rage
cannot stay buried in me

45:30.144 --> 45:31.812
for one more second...

45:32.855 --> 45:38.986
that a primal scream...
is the only satisfying release.

45:41.864 --> 45:42.865
Yes. Yeah.

45:48.829 --> 45:52.332
[screams]

46:12.144 --> 46:14.188
[young Dex over recording]
<i>I like making things happen</i>

46:14.271 --> 46:16.398
<i>without anybody knowing</i>
<i>it's me who did it.</i>

46:17.274 --> 46:20.360
[Mercer over recording]
<i>Let's do our exercise. Close your eyes.</i>

46:20.444 --> 46:21.862
[Matt] He didn't have any parents.

46:21.945 --> 46:23.739
[young Dex] <i>I'm digging a hole.</i>

46:24.698 --> 46:26.033
Spent a lot of time fighting.

46:26.116 --> 46:27.785
[young Dex]<i> Buried my anger in the ground.</i>

46:27.868 --> 46:28.952
-[Mercer] <i>Good.</i>
-Angry.

46:29.036 --> 46:33.373
-[Mercer] <i>Now cover it with dirt.</i>
-[young Dex] <i>Okay. But, Dr. Mercer?</i>

46:34.041 --> 46:36.335
-Go ahead and say it.
-[young Dex] <i>I want to open the box.</i>

46:36.418 --> 46:38.003
I promised to keep my mouth shut.

46:38.086 --> 46:40.422
-But you want to say it sounds familiar.
-Does it?

46:45.260 --> 46:48.013
I didn't have anyone either,
but I'm nothing like him.

46:49.890 --> 46:52.851
The tapes make it sound
like he was a killer at a young age.

46:52.935 --> 46:54.269
The guy's a psychopath.

46:58.524 --> 47:00.234
And I had a chance today.

47:01.568 --> 47:04.238
A shot to catch him off guard,
and I blew it.

47:05.447 --> 47:07.199
You did what you thought was right.

47:07.825 --> 47:10.118
You kept your word to Agent Nadeem.

47:10.202 --> 47:11.203
Yeah.

47:13.539 --> 47:15.332
And how many people will die
because of it?

47:35.227 --> 47:38.397
I don't know if I have the strength
to get through this.

47:39.314 --> 47:40.274
[Matt grunting]

47:40.858 --> 47:42.609
He's so stubborn.

47:43.610 --> 47:45.946
Full of fury and foolish pride.

47:47.823 --> 47:48.907
Please...

47:50.075 --> 47:51.577
watch over him.

47:53.370 --> 47:57.291
Keep him from making the same
damned mistake that took you from us.

47:58.250 --> 48:00.836
Our son is too much like you, Jack.

48:07.426 --> 48:08.635
Mom?

48:08.719 --> 48:10.137
Mom.

48:13.390 --> 48:14.391
No.
