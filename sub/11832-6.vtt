on "The Practice"...

00:03.180 --> 00:04.200
- [yells]
- What?

00:04.200 --> 00:06.110
- There's a head in the bag.

00:06.110 --> 00:07.180
- It's the woman I met
at the bar last night.

00:07.180 --> 00:08.180
- What are you doing
with her head?

00:08.180 --> 00:10.050
- Somebody put it in there.

00:10.050 --> 00:11.120
MAN: George Vogelman,
you are under arrest

00:11.120 --> 00:12.200
for the murder of Susan Robin.

00:12.200 --> 00:14.000
- The guy who killed
your girlfriend

00:14.000 --> 00:15.150
is not George Vogelman.

00:15.150 --> 00:18.090
Part of their case is the notion
that Susan could never

00:18.090 --> 00:20.080
have gone off
on some one-nighter.

00:20.080 --> 00:24.080
Can you think of anything that
could explain why she would?

00:24.080 --> 00:29.150
- I had been
a little unfaithful to Susan.

00:29.150 --> 00:31.000
- As I said to your dad,

00:31.000 --> 00:32.180
I'm convinced
they got the wrong guy.

00:32.180 --> 00:34.070
That means that this thing
was either a mission to frame

00:34.070 --> 00:35.140
George Vogelman,

00:35.140 --> 00:37.070
or somebody was after
your sister.

00:37.070 --> 00:39.140
Is it possible that your sister
could have kept some part

00:39.140 --> 00:41.010
of her life secret?

00:41.010 --> 00:43.180
- She did spend a lot
of time on the Internet.

00:43.180 --> 00:45.200
- Your guy was last
seen with her.

00:45.200 --> 00:46.220
He had her head.

00:46.220 --> 00:48.130
If George Vogelman didn't do it,

00:48.130 --> 00:50.100
he certainly represents
reasonable doubt

00:50.100 --> 00:51.100
for whoever did.

00:51.100 --> 00:53.030
- What are you saying?

00:53.030 --> 00:55.040
- They're not going to
reopen the investigation.

00:55.040 --> 00:56.120
- I don't give orders
to the police

00:56.120 --> 00:58.060
on how to investigate
their cases.

00:58.060 --> 01:00.070
- I'm asking you to order them
to investigate period.

01:00.070 --> 01:02.020
- Well, I can't order them
to keep looking

01:02.020 --> 01:04.040
if they're convinced
they have the killer.

01:04.040 --> 01:06.020
If their thinking is suspect,

01:06.020 --> 01:08.100
we have the device
to deal with that.

01:08.100 --> 01:10.000
We call it the trial.

01:14.060 --> 01:17.090
- Jay, I really appreciate
your willingness to testify.

01:17.090 --> 01:20.030
- I'm not going to be
that much help, Ms. Frutt.

01:20.030 --> 01:22.020
I can't say I think
your client is innocent.

01:22.020 --> 01:24.150
- I know, but you are
the only one who can supply

01:24.150 --> 01:26.210
a possible reason why
your girlfriend would have gone

01:26.210 --> 01:28.120
to a motel with George Vogelman.

01:29.230 --> 01:31.130
- I'm not crazy
about helping the guy

01:31.130 --> 01:33.170
who killed my sister.

01:33.170 --> 01:35.020
- All we're asking

01:35.020 --> 01:37.070
is that you talk
about the Internet thing.

01:38.170 --> 01:40.000
- I can't.

01:40.000 --> 01:41.230
- Dr. Roberts,
you know George Vogelman

01:41.230 --> 01:43.170
better than anybody.

01:43.170 --> 01:46.220
- But I wouldn't be able
to say that I truly know him.

01:46.220 --> 01:50.010
I see him at work, I--

01:50.010 --> 01:53.060
look, his being arrested
for this crime,

01:53.060 --> 01:55.120
it's hurt the whole office.

01:55.120 --> 01:58.000
I really don't want
to step into a witness chair

01:58.000 --> 02:00.010
and associate our medical
corporation with him--

02:00.010 --> 02:02.210
- He was an usher
at your wedding.

02:04.050 --> 02:07.030
- [sighs]

02:07.030 --> 02:10.110
And I couldn't imagine him doing
what they're accusing him of.

02:12.020 --> 02:14.230
But nor could I imagine
his taste for pornography

02:14.230 --> 02:17.180
or his going home
from bars with strangers.

02:17.180 --> 02:22.100
At best, all I could testify
to is that I thought I knew him.

02:23.200 --> 02:25.150
- Even his friends
have pulled away.

02:25.150 --> 02:26.160
- What have you got?

02:26.160 --> 02:27.180
- No history of violence,

02:27.180 --> 02:29.000
reputation for honesty,

02:29.000 --> 02:30.080

on his own volition.

02:30.080 --> 02:32.080
- Loner.
- Advertises in the personals.

02:32.080 --> 02:33.220
- Likes porno.
- Keeps to himself.

02:33.220 --> 02:35.180
- All right.

02:35.180 --> 02:37.120
- How many friends
or associates you talk to?

02:37.120 --> 02:38.220
- Dozen.
Maybe more.

02:38.220 --> 02:40.110
- Anybody say
they really knew the guy?

02:40.110 --> 02:41.120
I mean, completely?

02:41.120 --> 02:43.090
- No.
- Great.

02:43.090 --> 02:45.040
- Okay, this is what I think.

02:45.040 --> 02:47.030
They go to the motel,
then this woman rejected him

02:47.030 --> 02:48.140
at the wrong time.

02:48.140 --> 02:51.090
Maybe he felt sexually
humiliated or whatever.

02:51.090 --> 02:53.200
This is the ultimate ridicule,
and then he snapped.

02:53.200 --> 02:55.040
- Chopped off her head?

02:55.040 --> 02:56.160
REBECCA: Now, what's he
going to do?

02:56.160 --> 02:58.130
He's got no chance
of getting away with it.

02:58.130 --> 03:00.230
He's got a better shot at making
it look like he was framed.

03:00.230 --> 03:03.020
- So he sticks her head
in his medical bag

03:03.020 --> 03:04.150
and the big show begins.

03:04.150 --> 03:06.040
- Loner.
- Foot doctor.

03:06.040 --> 03:08.130
- He did it.
- Got mad, lost his head.

03:08.130 --> 03:09.140
- The loner.
- Is that it?

03:09.140 --> 03:11.050

else did go in there--

09:59.060 --> 10:00.220
- It had to be immaculate.

10:00.220 --> 10:02.130
- It's happened?

10:02.130 --> 10:04.200
Murders leaving behind
no physical evidence whatsoever?

10:04.200 --> 10:06.110
It has happened?

10:06.110 --> 10:08.050
- Yes, but the odds of this--
- It's happened?

10:08.050 --> 10:10.050
Yes or no, Detective.

10:11.080 --> 10:12.060
- Yes.

10:16.070 --> 10:18.100
- And, Detective, you're
familiar with the serial killer

10:18.100 --> 10:19.180
known as the Poet?

10:19.180 --> 10:20.180
- We don't believe
that the Poet--

10:20.180 --> 10:22.010
- The question is

10:22.010 --> 10:24.030
are you familiar
with the serial killer

10:24.030 --> 10:25.060
known as the Poet?

10:26.200 --> 10:28.210
- Yes.
- Again, yes or no.

10:28.210 --> 10:32.160
This person decapitates
his victims, yes or no?

10:32.160 --> 10:33.140
- Yes.

10:35.190 --> 10:37.180
- But you ruled him out.

10:37.180 --> 10:40.030
- The Poet severs the hands
as well

10:40.030 --> 10:42.130
and leaves the head behind.

10:42.130 --> 10:43.220
He doesn't take it with him.

10:43.220 --> 10:46.200
[people murmuring]

10:46.200 --> 10:49.000
- It's gone as well
as can be expected.

10:49.000 --> 10:50.140
- This is going well?

10:50.140 --> 10:52.040
Even I'm beginning to think
I'm guilty.

10:52.040 --> 10:54.220
- Look, everything they put in,
we were ready for.

10:54.220 --> 10:56.180
It's not like they put up
some surprise witness

10:56.180 --> 10:58.100
that said you've done
some strange things

10:58.100 --> 11:00.140
to cats or something.

11:00.140 --> 11:02.170
George, you know what I mean.

11:02.170 --> 11:04.190
We've expected
all of this testimony.

11:04.190 --> 11:06.050
It's not that it's not damaging,

11:06.050 --> 11:08.230
but there haven't been
any surprises.

11:08.230 --> 11:10.130
- So what now?

11:12.040 --> 11:13.180
- We might want to rest.
BOBBY: Rest?

11:13.180 --> 11:15.030
REBECCA: What?
- Well, think about it.

11:15.030 --> 11:16.110
All they've proven
is two things:

11:16.110 --> 11:17.200
he was with her,
he had her head.

11:17.200 --> 11:19.030
- Pretty good proof, ask me.

11:19.030 --> 11:20.130
EUGENE: No weapon,
no eyewitness.

11:20.130 --> 11:22.050
They tied him
to a corpse, not a crime.

11:22.050 --> 11:23.210
- Still, Eugene--
REBECCA: You can't rest on that.

11:23.210 --> 11:25.110
- Look, I'm not saying
it's the thing to do,

11:25.110 --> 11:26.110
but let's face it.

11:26.110 --> 11:27.160
What do we have?

11:27.160 --> 11:28.230
A nice guy?

11:28.230 --> 11:30.110
Maybe we should just
say to the jury,

11:30.110 --> 11:32.110
"Hey, we were ready
to put on the defense,

11:32.110 --> 11:34.080
but since they didn't make
their burden, we don't need to."

11:34.080 --> 11:35.190
- That is such a risk.

11:35.190 --> 11:37.060
- We already sprinkled
on the idea of the Poet.

11:37.060 --> 11:38.210
- Any theory as to who
else could have done it?

11:38.210 --> 11:40.020
- Internet, maybe a stalker.
- You can't rest.

11:40.020 --> 11:41.110
- Pretty lame.
- I don't know.

11:41.110 --> 11:42.170
- Eugene,
he looks completely guilty.

11:42.170 --> 11:44.100
You can't just get up and say

11:44.100 --> 11:45.160
they didn't make their burden,
that's stupid.

11:45.160 --> 11:46.180
- Well, maybe we can say
he involuntarily

11:46.180 --> 11:48.060
cut her head off
five times.

11:48.060 --> 11:50.030
- Oh, that's real funny.
- Call me stupid?

11:50.030 --> 11:51.180
- I didn't call you stupid, I
said it would be stupid to rest.

11:51.180 --> 11:53.130
- All right.

11:53.130 --> 11:55.210
Ellenor, what do you think?

11:55.210 --> 11:57.100
- Well, I see Eugene's point,

11:57.100 --> 11:58.200
but I don't think a jury
is going to let him go

11:58.200 --> 12:00.070
on a burden of proof thing.

12:00.070 --> 12:01.180
I think our best
defense is George.

12:01.180 --> 12:03.110
He's honest
and he plays honest.

12:03.110 --> 12:05.160
- If George didn't do it,
then who?

12:05.160 --> 12:07.130
- It's not our job
to answer that question.

12:07.130 --> 12:09.200
- Well, I realize this, but it's
the question I keep asking,

12:09.200 --> 12:12.060
and the jury's going to be
asking it back in that room.

12:12.060 --> 12:15.040
[all talking at once]

12:16.190 --> 12:18.120
- If I understand
your thinking on this, Ellenor,

12:18.120 --> 12:20.060
the police basically
stopped looking.

12:20.060 --> 12:21.160
That should be your defense.

12:21.160 --> 12:23.070
The only reason
we don't know who else

12:23.070 --> 12:25.030
if not George
is because the police

12:25.030 --> 12:26.090
never asked that question.

12:26.090 --> 12:27.160
That's what you have to key on.

12:27.160 --> 12:29.120
- The guy had her head
in his bag.

12:29.120 --> 12:31.020
We're going to put the police
on trial for not asking--

12:31.020 --> 12:32.110
- I'm not talking
about the police on trial.

12:32.110 --> 12:34.080
- You guys are playing games.

12:34.080 --> 12:36.210
At the end of the day,
he had her head.

12:36.210 --> 12:39.230
That's got nothing to do
with any faulty investigation.

12:39.230 --> 12:42.010
He had her head.

12:42.010 --> 12:43.220
- So tell us what to do,
Einstein.

12:43.220 --> 12:45.190
- You know something, Lindsay,
you've been bitchy a lot lately.

12:45.190 --> 12:47.070
REBECCA: I think he's right.

12:47.070 --> 12:48.160
We can't be playing
reasonable doubt games.

12:48.160 --> 12:50.050
I agree with Jimmy.
- I'm a bitch?

12:50.050 --> 12:51.100
- On his defense theory.

12:51.100 --> 12:52.200
You have to defend George,

12:52.200 --> 12:54.000
you can't be
attacking the police.

12:54.000 --> 12:55.090
EUGENE: We got to do both.

12:55.090 --> 12:56.170
We got to put George up,

12:56.170 --> 12:58.160
let him be as convincing
as he can be,

12:58.160 --> 13:00.230
and we got to open
the door to other possibilities.

13:00.230 --> 13:02.090
- Excuse me, hello.

13:02.090 --> 13:03.120
Boyfriend lives alone.

13:03.120 --> 13:05.140
Brother, big house.
- So?

13:05.140 --> 13:07.160
LINDSAY: So the murder took
place between 1:00 and 3:00 a.m.

13:07.160 --> 13:09.040
Why weren't they considered?

13:09.040 --> 13:10.210
- They were checked out.
They're both choirboys.

13:10.210 --> 13:12.090
- Yeah, but still.

13:12.090 --> 13:14.090
No official alibi
if everyone's asleep.

13:14.090 --> 13:17.020
Why not plan B them?

13:17.020 --> 13:18.210
They're going to testify anyway.

13:18.210 --> 13:20.130
- What's plan B?

13:20.130 --> 13:23.000
- It might be worth a try.
- Give them a soft plan B.

13:23.000 --> 13:24.210
- What's plan B?
- Talk about a risk.

13:24.210 --> 13:26.190
- You got any better ideas?

13:26.190 --> 13:29.010
- All right, but first we have
to be sure it won't backfire.

13:29.010 --> 13:31.090
- Plan B.
Soft for both.

13:31.090 --> 13:34.130
- Comb every report,
make sure it's really available.

13:34.130 --> 13:36.070
- They both gave statements.
- Dissect them.

13:36.070 --> 13:37.220
- You take the boyfriend,
I got the brother.

13:41.010 --> 13:42.220
- What the hell is Plan B?

13:44.210 --> 13:47.110
- Basically, it means we point
the finger at other people.

13:47.110 --> 13:50.010
It's very dangerous because
normally when the defense starts

13:50.010 --> 13:51.110
hatching theories of their own,

13:51.110 --> 13:53.210
the jury can shift
the burden back to us,

13:53.210 --> 13:55.180
which we definitely do not want.

13:55.180 --> 13:57.130
- And when you say soft--

13:57.130 --> 14:00.110
- Our soft plan B
is we do it more gently.

14:00.110 --> 14:03.110
Instead of accusing,
it's more like what-if-ing.

14:03.110 --> 14:06.040
It's less likely
to alienate the jury...

14:07.150 --> 14:09.100
But it's a risky strategy.

14:09.100 --> 14:11.070
- Well, then why do it?

14:11.070 --> 14:14.230

17:59.160 --> 18:00.170
STEVE: What's going on?

18:00.170 --> 18:02.160
JUDGE: Sit down, Mr. Tisbury.

18:02.160 --> 18:05.150
- How much money did you lose,
Steve?

18:05.150 --> 18:07.070
- About $300,000.

18:07.070 --> 18:08.120
- You owed this amount
to people?

18:08.120 --> 18:10.050
- I had investors, yes.

18:10.050 --> 18:11.210
- Your father, he has
liver cancer, isn't that right?

18:11.210 --> 18:13.110
- Yes.

18:13.110 --> 18:15.020
EUGENE: He was diagnosed
with about eight months to live?

18:15.020 --> 18:16.210
- Yes.

18:16.210 --> 18:19.160
- According to his will, if you
know, who inherits his estate?

18:19.160 --> 18:21.190
STEVE: I guess me.

18:21.190 --> 18:23.040
- You guess you?

18:23.040 --> 18:24.220
You're the sole beneficiary?
- Yes.

18:24.220 --> 18:26.180
- But if your sister
was still alive,

18:26.180 --> 18:28.100
then there'd be two
beneficiaries, wouldn't there?

18:28.100 --> 18:29.190
- What are you saying?

18:29.190 --> 18:31.060
- I'm saying
that it works out well

18:31.060 --> 18:32.170
for you having your sister die
before your dad.

18:32.170 --> 18:33.170
TISBURY: Objection.
- What?

18:33.170 --> 18:35.050
EUGENE: If she had outlived him,

18:35.050 --> 18:37.000
then the estate goes sideways,
maybe splits.

18:37.000 --> 18:39.150
- Objection!
- All right.

18:39.150 --> 18:40.160
Mr. Young.

18:40.160 --> 18:41.220
- This witness has testified

18:41.220 --> 18:43.090
to his estrangement
with his sister.

18:43.090 --> 18:44.210
He has testified to his debt.

18:44.210 --> 18:46.060
He is also the only one

18:46.060 --> 18:47.200
to serve up
the Internet red herring,

18:47.200 --> 18:49.130
perhaps to use
as a safety net,

18:49.130 --> 18:50.230
in case suspicion ever
fell to him.

18:50.230 --> 18:52.110
- Move to strike all of that.

18:52.110 --> 18:55.160
- I am entitled
to question this witness.

18:59.180 --> 19:00.210
- Go ahead.

19:06.000 --> 19:08.180
- Anybody with you the night
of your sister's murder, Steve?

19:08.180 --> 19:10.190
- I was home.

19:10.190 --> 19:12.110
My father was home.

19:12.110 --> 19:14.180
- Were you home
before your father went to bed?

19:14.180 --> 19:16.080
STEVE: No.

19:16.080 --> 19:17.130
- When did you get home?

19:17.130 --> 19:19.080
- Probably around midnight.

19:19.080 --> 19:22.160
- Did he see you come in?
- He goes to bed at ten.

19:22.160 --> 19:24.160
- Ever take any medication
for depression, Steve?

19:24.160 --> 19:26.100
- Objection.
JUDGE: Overruled.

19:26.100 --> 19:29.080
- You ever take medication
for a mental condition, Steve?

19:30.100 --> 19:31.130
- I take lithium.

19:31.130 --> 19:33.060
EUGENE: For depression?
- Yes.

19:33.060 --> 19:35.060
- Did you murder your sister
and frame George Vogelman?

19:35.060 --> 19:36.210
- What?
TUSBURY: Objection!

19:36.210 --> 19:38.050
- Did you follow her to the bar
then go to the motel?

19:38.050 --> 19:39.050
TISBURY: Objection!
- Are you crazy?

19:39.050 --> 19:40.170
- Overruled.

19:40.170 --> 19:42.050
- It was the perfect
opportunity, wasn't it?

19:42.050 --> 19:43.080
You could get
George Vogelman's address

19:43.080 --> 19:44.180
by running down his plates.

19:44.180 --> 19:46.020
After he leaves the motel,
you go inside

19:46.020 --> 19:47.170
and make yourself
a sole beneficiary

19:47.170 --> 19:50.050
and then go to plant
the head in George's car.

- Did the police
ever question you

19:58.120 --> 19:59.160
in connection
with your sister's death?

19:59.160 --> 20:01.080
- Of course they didn't.

20:01.080 --> 20:02.180
- They never even brought
you down for questioning?

20:02.180 --> 20:04.080
- No, they did not.

20:04.080 --> 20:05.170
- Maybe you pulled off
the perfect crime, Steve.

20:05.170 --> 20:07.040
TISBURY: Objection!
JUDGE: Sustained.

20:07.040 --> 20:08.090
- Maybe you're that good.
- Objection!

- Ellenor, the kid
lost his sister.

I just accused him
of killing her,

Do not try to make me feel good.

20:54.110 --> 20:55.180
- Here's the defendant.

20:58.230 --> 21:00.100
- Is it possible
he could have done it?

21:00.100 --> 21:01.110

If the jury can see you
for who you really are,

I met her at the bar.

I never communicated
with her on the Internet.

26:32.050 --> 26:34.220
Say this woman meets a man
on the Internet.

He maybe oversells himself
just a little.

26:38.030 --> 26:39.210

She's disappointed.

Rejects him,

27:22.150 --> 27:24.160
- Any ideas?
I hate to rest on that.

27:24.160 --> 27:26.040
- Should we redirect?

27:26.040 --> 27:28.030
- I don't think so.
It could get worse.

27:28.030 --> 27:29.090
- Maybe we--

27:31.160 --> 27:32.160
- What?

27:32.160 --> 27:33.200
- I have an idea.

27:35.210 --> 27:37.230
- The defense recalls

is because of your relationship
with our office.

28:27.030 --> 28:29.000

you called me.

28:29.000 --> 28:32.030
- Well, does our office
enjoy a certain trust with you?

Ms. Gamble,

28:48.040 --> 28:50.080
did you and I discuss this case?

28:54.020 --> 28:55.060
- Briefly

28:55.060 --> 28:57.010
and generally.

28:57.010 --> 28:58.200
ELLENOR: And did you tell me
that the police

28:58.200 --> 29:00.190
and the D.A.'s office both

29:00.190 --> 29:03.050
just wanted to check "solved"
in the little box next to--

29:03.050 --> 29:04.230
- Objection.
- Overruled.

29:04.230 --> 29:07.000
- Let me speed things up.

29:07.000 --> 29:09.150
Did you basically tell me that,
given the publicity,

29:09.150 --> 29:12.020
a conviction
is desperately needed here?

29:12.020 --> 29:14.050
That if anybody else
were charged with this crime,

29:14.050 --> 29:16.050
your office would never get
that conviction?

29:16.050 --> 29:17.110
Since George Vogelman,

29:17.110 --> 29:19.050
having the head
in his medical bag,

29:19.050 --> 29:23.010
would guarantee reasonable doubt
to whoever else was charged?

29:23.010 --> 29:26.020
And because of that, the police
and the D.A.'s office,

29:26.020 --> 29:27.200
on at least
an unconscious level,

29:27.200 --> 29:30.040
might want to believe that
George Vogelman is the killer,

29:30.040 --> 29:33.090
and, therefore, not bother
to look for anybody else?

29:33.090 --> 29:35.120
Did to share all that with me?

29:35.120 --> 29:38.100
- First, I have no direct
information on this case.

29:38.100 --> 29:39.180
Second--
- Please just respond.

29:39.180 --> 29:40.200
- I am responding.

29:40.200 --> 29:42.210
It was a long question, counsel.

29:42.210 --> 29:44.230
- Your Honor.
- She can answer.

29:47.100 --> 29:50.010
- I never suggested
or even hinted

29:50.010 --> 29:53.000
that somebody else
besides George Vogelman

29:53.000 --> 29:54.030
committed this crime.

29:54.030 --> 29:55.160
- I didn't ask what you thought.

29:55.160 --> 29:58.040
- And I never suggested
that the D.A.'s office

29:58.040 --> 30:00.140
wasn't convinced
of your client's guilt.

30:00.140 --> 30:03.010
- Did you say they might not
want to look further?

30:03.010 --> 30:05.020
That it's easier to believe
you've got the right guy

30:05.020 --> 30:07.110
when there's pressure
to get a conviction?

30:07.110 --> 30:09.230
- I said sometimes
it's been known to happen.

30:09.230 --> 30:11.150
I didn't say it happened here.

30:11.150 --> 30:14.010
- Yes, but you said
it's been known to happen

30:14.010 --> 30:16.210
in a conversation
about this case,

30:16.210 --> 30:18.070
didn't you?

30:20.070 --> 30:22.090
- Again, I have no reason

30:22.090 --> 30:25.080
to believe that
this particular investigation

30:25.080 --> 30:29.000
has been anything
but proper and thorough.

30:30.090 --> 30:32.020
- Thank you.

30:32.020 --> 30:34.110
That was a good answer
for the team.

30:39.210 --> 30:41.220
- Are you suggesting
the investigation's tainted?

30:41.220 --> 30:43.120
- Do you think
there was collusion

30:43.120 --> 30:45.010
between police
and the D.A.'s office?

30:45.010 --> 30:46.070
- I've got nothing
to say right now,

30:46.070 --> 30:47.070
I'm sorry.

30:47.070 --> 30:50.050
[all speaking at once]

30:53.010 --> 30:55.100
- Get out!
What the hell was that, Ellenor?

30:55.100 --> 30:56.170
- Helen, I'm sorry.

30:56.170 --> 30:58.220
- You just cut my legs out!
Sorry?

30:58.220 --> 31:00.130
I tell you something
in confidence

31:00.130 --> 31:02.040
and you ambush me in open court?

31:02.040 --> 31:04.030
- I had to make a choice.
I had a duty to my client--

31:04.030 --> 31:05.210
- No good!

31:05.210 --> 31:08.010
You've screwed me and this
office for the last time.

31:08.010 --> 31:10.090
- I was backed into a--
- That's crap.

31:18.150 --> 31:19.150
- She's right.

31:19.150 --> 31:21.070
- What was I going to do?

31:21.070 --> 31:23.040
Tell George, "Hey, I could've
saved you, but"--

31:23.040 --> 31:24.210
- George isn't the only client
in this firm.

31:24.210 --> 31:26.000
- No, Pearson is.

31:26.000 --> 31:27.190
BOBBY: She's right, Ellenor.

31:27.190 --> 31:30.020
We need our credibility with
every case, not just this one.

31:30.020 --> 31:31.150
- It's not something
I plan to do.

31:31.150 --> 31:33.080
- But you did it!

31:37.040 --> 31:41.000
We have to rely on relationships
with D.A.s a lot.

31:41.000 --> 31:42.200
Sometimes those off-the-cuff
conversations

31:42.200 --> 31:43.220
make the difference.

31:43.220 --> 31:45.040
You think any D.A. down there

31:45.040 --> 31:46.200
is going to want
to talk to us again?

31:46.200 --> 31:48.140
- So, I should let George
go down so we can preserve

31:48.140 --> 31:50.120
our invites
to the Christmas parties?

31:50.120 --> 31:52.080
- Yes.

31:52.080 --> 31:53.160
Our dialogue
with that office

31:53.160 --> 31:55.150
is more important
than any one case!

31:55.150 --> 31:57.080
LINDSAY: I've got to deal with
them on sentencing next week.

31:57.080 --> 31:58.150
I'm sure they'll
be in great moods too.

31:58.150 --> 32:00.020
- Oh, get over your professor,
Lindsay.

32:00.020 --> 32:01.160
What did you do,
sleep with the guy?

32:03.220 --> 32:04.230
[crash]

32:09.000 --> 32:10.050
BOBBY: Hey, come on.
EUGENE: Ellenor.

32:10.050 --> 32:11.090
LUCY: I love it
when girls fight.

32:11.090 --> 32:12.120
It's better than hockey.

32:12.120 --> 32:13.130
- Quiet, Lucy.

32:13.130 --> 32:16.160
Back up, Ellenor.
Back up.

32:16.160 --> 32:17.140
You too.

32:19.020 --> 32:21.020
I don't care
what the stakes are.

32:21.020 --> 32:22.230
If the D.A. has
an off-the-record conversation

32:22.230 --> 32:25.210
with any of us,
it stays off the record.

32:25.210 --> 32:28.000
Otherwise,
it's like Lindsay says,

32:28.000 --> 32:30.210
we lose our credibility
in every case.

32:30.210 --> 32:32.100
- Well, tell that
to the drowning man,

32:32.100 --> 32:34.030
that you're more concerned
about the boat.

32:34.030 --> 32:37.070
- I am not talking
to a drowning man, Ellenor.

32:37.070 --> 32:39.180
I am talking to you.

32:39.180 --> 32:42.150
- Let's everybody
settle down a little.

32:42.150 --> 32:44.220
There's a lot of stakes
for a lot of people.

32:44.220 --> 32:47.200
Tearing each other new armpits
isn't going to help anybody.

33:05.020 --> 33:07.120
- Of course they had to arrest
George Vogelman.

33:07.120 --> 33:10.120
The victim's head
was in his possession.

33:10.120 --> 33:12.220
I don't blame the police
for thinking he did it.

33:12.220 --> 33:14.230
How could they not?

33:14.230 --> 33:16.150
How could you not?

33:16.150 --> 33:19.090
But there's a reason
nobody saw him commit the crime.

33:19.090 --> 33:23.070
There is a reason there was
no weapon connected to him.

33:23.070 --> 33:25.060
He didn't do it.

33:25.060 --> 33:27.150
Who did?
I don't know.

33:27.150 --> 33:30.110
You heard my co-counsel
grill Susan Robin's brother

33:30.110 --> 33:33.010
as a possible suspect.

33:33.010 --> 33:36.040
Well, let me admit a truth.

33:36.040 --> 33:37.120
We don't have
any direct evidence

33:37.120 --> 33:38.230
to conclude the brother did it.

33:38.230 --> 33:41.180
If so, we certainly
would have offered it,

33:41.180 --> 33:43.160
but he did have a motive.

33:43.160 --> 33:44.200
He was estranged from her,

33:44.200 --> 33:46.170
his debt, the will,

33:46.170 --> 33:49.190
his whereabouts at the time
can't really be accounted for.

33:49.190 --> 33:52.230
He could have done it.

33:52.230 --> 33:55.020
The reason we can't know

33:55.020 --> 33:57.080
is because the police
never really bothered

33:57.080 --> 33:58.110
to check that out.

33:58.110 --> 34:00.120
Steve Robin said himself

34:00.120 --> 34:04.020
that they never even
questioned him.

34:04.020 --> 34:05.100
Imagine.

34:05.100 --> 34:07.200
He has motive,
opportunity,

34:07.200 --> 34:11.030
no alibi, and they didn't even
investigate him

34:11.030 --> 34:13.010
as a possibility.

34:13.010 --> 34:14.230
Why?

34:14.230 --> 34:18.230
Because the head was found in
George Vogelman's medical bag.

34:18.230 --> 34:21.150
And Jay Hickman,
Susan's boyfriend?

34:21.150 --> 34:23.139
I have no reason
to believe that he killed her,

34:23.139 --> 34:26.100
but his whereabouts
can't be accounted for either.

34:26.100 --> 34:27.210
Motive?

34:27.210 --> 34:30.170
Well, she was with another man
in a motel.

34:32.070 --> 34:35.070
And just who was
she talking to on the Internet?

34:35.070 --> 34:38.120
There are a lot of questions
left unanswered here

34:38.120 --> 34:43.060
because the police
never really looked.

34:43.060 --> 34:45.040
You heard
District Attorney Helen Gamble

34:45.040 --> 34:48.020
admit it's possible they didn't
want to find anybody else

34:48.020 --> 34:50.159
because they needed
to get a conviction on this,

34:50.159 --> 34:53.010
and the head, being
in George Vogelman's bag,

34:53.010 --> 34:56.030
he was the only one
they could possibly convict.

34:56.030 --> 34:58.230
Easier to stay with him
and not complicate it.

35:00.170 --> 35:04.130
Any evidence offered
as to George Vogelman's motive?

35:04.130 --> 35:05.170
No.

35:05.170 --> 35:07.080
And why,

35:07.080 --> 35:10.000
if he is supposedly
trying to get away with a crime,

35:10.000 --> 35:12.120
does he put
the victim's head in a bag

35:12.120 --> 35:14.040
and go to the police with it?

35:14.040 --> 35:16.070
Does that make sense?

35:17.180 --> 35:19.160
And let's not forget
about the Poet,

35:19.160 --> 35:21.080
a known serial killer out there,

35:21.080 --> 35:23.120
in the Boston area,

35:23.120 --> 35:26.190
that has an MO
for decapitating victims.

35:26.190 --> 35:29.190
Has anybody accounted for him?

35:29.190 --> 35:33.000
There are a lot of questions
that need answering.

35:33.000 --> 35:36.080
Questions that were
never asked or explored

35:36.080 --> 35:40.000
because this just seemed
so simple.

35:40.000 --> 35:42.010
The head was in his bag.

35:42.010 --> 35:43.110
He must have done it.

35:43.110 --> 35:45.180
Well, he didn't.

35:45.180 --> 35:48.080
I have no doubt the prosecution
needs that conviction.

35:48.080 --> 35:49.230
They surely do,

35:49.230 --> 35:53.220
but they are prosecuting
the wrong man.

35:57.120 --> 36:00.210
- No evidence,
not even microscopic,

36:00.210 --> 36:03.230
of anybody else
being in that room

36:03.230 --> 36:06.010
except George Vogelman.

36:06.010 --> 36:08.180
Defense counsel gave us
quite a show, didn't they?

36:08.180 --> 36:10.120
The brother did it.

36:10.120 --> 36:13.050
No, maybe it was the boyfriend.

36:13.050 --> 36:15.130
How about that serial killer?

36:15.130 --> 36:17.230
Forensics combed that room.

36:17.230 --> 36:20.020
There were saliva samples,

36:20.020 --> 36:23.030
fibers from clothing,
semen,

36:23.030 --> 36:25.160
hair strands,
fingerprints.

36:25.160 --> 36:28.050
They didn't go
to a serial killer

36:28.050 --> 36:31.120
or Susan Robin's brother
or her boyfriend.

36:31.120 --> 36:35.030
They all belonged
to George Vogelman,

36:35.030 --> 36:38.030
the man who says
he went home alone.

36:38.030 --> 36:41.230
The man who sits there
with no alibi.

36:41.230 --> 36:45.090
Yes, it was easy
to conclude he did it,

36:45.090 --> 36:47.210
and on top of all
the insurmountable evidence

36:47.210 --> 36:48.230
at the scene,

36:48.230 --> 36:51.160
he had the victim's head.

36:52.180 --> 36:55.030
My God, he decapitated a woman,

36:55.030 --> 36:57.100
and his lawyers
have offered you nothing

36:57.100 --> 37:00.040
but spin as a defense.

37:00.040 --> 37:01.120
Did they put in one piece

37:01.120 --> 37:04.010
of physical
or testimonial evidence,

37:04.010 --> 37:07.000
anything at all exculpatory?

37:07.000 --> 37:08.000
No.

37:08.000 --> 37:10.070
Just spin.

37:10.070 --> 37:11.150
"He did it.

37:11.150 --> 37:13.000
"No, he did it.

37:13.000 --> 37:14.170
Look there.
Over here."

37:14.170 --> 37:16.140
Don't forget
that police conspiracy.

37:16.140 --> 37:20.090
Collusion with the D.A.

37:20.090 --> 37:24.130
