00:03.177 --> 00:04.830
I am not saying that your
coworker is right or wrong.

00:04.917 --> 00:06.702
Amira, I am just saying that
he is entitled to his opinion.

00:06.789 --> 00:09.879
Whether or not you agree
with that is up to--

00:09.966 --> 00:12.534
how is that sexist?

00:12.621 --> 00:13.883
It is too early for this, okay?

00:13.970 --> 00:15.580
Please save the
postmodern Muslim

00:15.667 --> 00:17.191
progressive grad student speech
for someone else.

00:17.278 --> 00:19.367
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Excuse me, sir.

00:19.454 --> 00:21.369
Call you back.

00:21.456 --> 00:22.848
Can I help you?

00:22.935 --> 00:23.936
Some man just--
he tried to attack me.

00:24.024 --> 00:25.547
How? When?

00:25.634 --> 00:26.939
Like, five minutes ago.
He had a knife.

00:27.027 --> 00:28.463
Okay, are you all right?
Do you need medical attention?

00:28.550 --> 00:29.768
No, no, no,
he grabbed my arm, and I--

00:29.855 --> 00:32.206
Wallet and watch now.

00:34.077 --> 00:35.165
Now.

00:35.252 --> 00:36.427
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

00:36.514 --> 00:38.038
Just relax, all right?
Put the gun--

00:38.125 --> 00:39.996
Wallet and watch
or you're a dead man.

00:40.083 --> 00:41.215
Do what he says, bitch.

00:44.696 --> 00:45.958
Okay. All right.

00:46.046 --> 00:48.526
Okay. Okay.
- Come on!

00:48.613 --> 00:52.704
All right. There you go.

00:52.791 --> 00:54.097
- Let's go.
- All right, all right.

00:54.184 --> 00:55.751
Just take it.

01:09.678 --> 01:13.508
Next time a girl waves
at you, keep walking, dumbass.

01:26.956 --> 01:29.393
You okay? I called 911.

01:29.480 --> 01:31.091
Cops will be here any second.

01:33.223 --> 01:36.400
Nina? Hey.

01:36.487 --> 01:38.054
Okay, I'll be there
in 30 minutes.

01:38.141 --> 01:39.708
I'm just dealing
with something personal.

01:51.111 --> 01:52.721
So what do we got?

01:52.808 --> 01:58.857
Female, Hispanic, about 25,
no purse, no ID, no phone.

01:58.944 --> 02:00.381
So we're thinking robbery?

02:00.468 --> 02:01.469
Looks that way.

02:12.567 --> 02:14.221
Hey, everything good?

02:14.308 --> 02:15.222
All good.

02:17.833 --> 02:19.617
Whoa, what happened?

02:19.704 --> 02:22.229
I, uh, took a spill
while I was jogging.

02:22.316 --> 02:24.013
But you're okay?

02:24.100 --> 02:26.755
Yeah. I'll have ERT
start to process the scene.

02:30.498 --> 02:31.977
Morning, folks.

02:32.064 --> 02:33.631
So victim was killed
in a federal park,

02:33.718 --> 02:35.024
which means this one's
all ours.

02:35.111 --> 02:36.808
Preliminary report
suggests she's Hispanic,

02:36.895 --> 02:38.462
approximately 25 years old.

02:38.549 --> 02:40.682
Other than that, we are
starting at the beginning.

02:40.769 --> 02:42.901
So we get an ID yet?

02:42.988 --> 02:43.946
Got a hit on facial rec.

02:44.033 --> 02:46.949
Her name is Marta Muñoz.

02:47.036 --> 02:48.429
Uh-huh.

02:48.516 --> 02:49.299
All right,
start preaching to us.

02:49.386 --> 02:51.345
Elise, tell us
about Marta Muñoz.

02:51.432 --> 02:53.825
No priors, single,
and appears to have

02:53.912 --> 02:55.436
been working as a hairstylist.

02:55.523 --> 02:56.959
Mm, she file any
police reports

02:57.046 --> 02:58.265
or restraining orders
in the last few months?

02:58.352 --> 02:59.875
Negative.

02:59.962 --> 03:01.398
There's not much of a
social media presence, either.

03:01.485 --> 03:03.095
By all accounts,
looks like she was living

03:03.183 --> 03:04.662
a pretty mundane existence.

03:04.749 --> 03:05.707
All right, well, let's get
some video in the bath

03:05.794 --> 03:07.099
and start scrubbing.

03:07.187 --> 03:08.753
I want pods, street cams,
surveillance video.

03:08.840 --> 03:10.277
This perp didn't just
appear out of thin air.

03:10.364 --> 03:12.322
Elise, and pull Marta's
last known address

03:12.409 --> 03:14.411
and get it over
to Tiff and Scola, please.

03:14.498 --> 03:15.804
Got it.

03:15.891 --> 03:17.197
Good morning.

03:17.284 --> 03:18.937
It looks like we're
starting from scratch.

03:19.024 --> 03:20.896
Yeah, a quiet part of town,
especially at night.

03:20.983 --> 03:22.245
There's not a lot of
surveillance cameras

03:22.332 --> 03:24.552
down there, either.
- Forensics?

03:24.639 --> 03:26.771
OA and Nina are at the
M.E.'s office right now.

03:32.299 --> 03:34.388
Cause of death
is strangulation.

03:34.475 --> 03:36.390
You can see the bruising
under the neck.

03:36.477 --> 03:39.567
Hyoid bone was crushed,
cutting off the flow of oxygen.

03:39.654 --> 03:41.090
What about the marks
on her wrist?

03:41.177 --> 03:42.091
Ratchet marks.

03:42.178 --> 03:43.484
The killer used handcuffs.

03:43.571 --> 03:45.137
Looks like it.

03:45.225 --> 03:46.443
So that he could
strangle her?

03:46.530 --> 03:47.836
So he could rape her.

03:47.923 --> 03:50.360
There's significant tearing
and abrasions.

03:50.447 --> 03:52.319
He leave any DNA behind?

03:52.406 --> 03:54.103
No, unfortunately.

03:54.190 --> 03:55.322
Nothing under
the fingernails?

03:55.409 --> 03:56.540
Nothing.

03:56.627 --> 03:59.239
I wish I had
more answers for you.

03:59.326 --> 04:00.501
So do we.

04:15.255 --> 04:17.257
Hi. Mrs. Muñoz?
- Yes?

04:17.344 --> 04:21.173
Hi, we're Special Agents
Chase and Zidan.

04:21.261 --> 04:22.566
What's going on?

04:22.653 --> 04:25.221
Has something happened?

04:25.308 --> 04:27.267
Yes, I'm afraid so.

04:27.354 --> 04:28.703
Oh, my God.

04:28.790 --> 04:31.619
It's Marta, isn't it?

04:31.706 --> 04:33.142
I'm sorry to say,
your daughter

04:33.229 --> 04:35.666
was killed this morning.

04:35.753 --> 04:37.973
Hey. I got you.
I got you.

04:44.196 --> 04:47.591
Marta was a good girl,
a good daughter.

04:47.678 --> 04:49.593
Was she having any problems?

04:49.680 --> 04:52.422
Was anybody threatening her,
maybe an ex-boyfriend?

04:52.509 --> 04:54.424
No, nothing like that.

04:54.511 --> 04:56.470
She wasn't dating anyone.

04:56.557 --> 04:59.299
And her last boyfriend
was very nice.

04:59.386 --> 05:01.605
He moved to Texas, I think.

05:01.692 --> 05:03.825
Okay, did she mention
anything unusual lately?

05:03.912 --> 05:05.957
Like what?

05:06.044 --> 05:08.525
Did she mention somebody
who might have been scary,

05:08.612 --> 05:11.746
anybody following her,
watching her?

05:11.833 --> 05:13.661
Last week.

05:13.748 --> 05:15.402
She said that some guy
was watching her

05:15.489 --> 05:17.795
when she closed up the salon.

05:17.882 --> 05:20.058
I told her she should
start taking taxis.

05:20.145 --> 05:22.757
It's too dangerous to take the
subway at that time of night,

05:22.844 --> 05:25.716
but she wanted to save money.

05:25.803 --> 05:28.153
She kept talking
about buying a house up

05:28.240 --> 05:29.677
in Westchester someday.

05:34.551 --> 05:38.381
Did this man, did he--

05:38.468 --> 05:40.949
did he do more
than just kill her?

05:43.778 --> 05:44.735
Yes.

05:56.312 --> 05:58.836
We are gonna find
the man that hurt Marta.

05:58.923 --> 06:00.142
Okay?

06:00.229 --> 06:01.361
He's gonna pay
for what he did.

06:03.885 --> 06:04.842
I promise.

06:09.978 --> 06:12.154
I'm so sorry.

06:15.810 --> 06:17.115
All right, listen up,
Yankee fans.

06:17.202 --> 06:19.509
Marta told her mother
someone was watching her

06:19.596 --> 06:22.120
near the salon
around closing time last week.

06:22.207 --> 06:23.687
So let's start pulling video

06:23.774 --> 06:26.124
near the Left Bank Hair Salon
on East 8th Street.

06:26.211 --> 06:28.257
Hey, you got a sec?

06:28.344 --> 06:29.389
Yeah.

06:36.091 --> 06:37.788
I just got off the phone
with Detective Chavez

06:37.875 --> 06:39.311
at the 27th precinct.

06:39.399 --> 06:41.183
I am so sorry. I had no idea.

06:41.270 --> 06:44.273
I'm fine.

06:44.360 --> 06:46.014
I don't care how long
you've been on the job.

06:46.101 --> 06:47.624
Being robbed at gunpoint--

06:47.711 --> 06:50.061
It was not a big deal.

06:50.148 --> 06:52.194
He asked for my wallet.
I gave it to him.

06:52.281 --> 06:53.848
That was that.

06:53.935 --> 06:57.199
Well, NYPD has offered
to let us handle the case.

06:57.286 --> 06:58.766
So if you--
- No, no, no.

06:58.853 --> 07:00.507
I appreciate that,
but it was a few addicts

07:00.594 --> 07:01.508
trying to make a quick buck.

07:01.595 --> 07:02.726
Isobel, that's it.

07:02.813 --> 07:04.554
I'm not so sure about that.

07:04.641 --> 07:06.338
Case detective thinks that
these two perps

07:06.426 --> 07:09.472
are responsible for at least
ten other robberies.

07:09.559 --> 07:11.474
Okay. Well, that's your call.

07:11.561 --> 07:14.172
But I'm good.

07:14.259 --> 07:16.000
If that's what you want, okay.

07:20.178 --> 07:21.615
If you don't mind,
I would prefer

07:21.702 --> 07:24.008
to keep this private, though.

07:24.095 --> 07:25.183
Yeah, of course.

07:30.841 --> 07:32.930
Hey.
How'd it go with the boss?

07:33.017 --> 07:34.628
Good, she just needs me
to clean up a report.

07:34.715 --> 07:36.630
Oh, fun.
Well, it'll have to wait.

07:36.717 --> 07:38.849
The JOC pulled
street cam footage,

07:38.936 --> 07:41.678
and they found the dude
who was following Marta.

07:41.765 --> 07:44.986
We ran facial rec, and that
is him--Norm Carver, 35.

07:45.073 --> 07:47.684
He has two priors,
one for forcible touching,

07:47.771 --> 07:50.078
and one for stalking
in the third degree.

07:50.165 --> 07:51.775
He has warrants out
for his arrest on both.

07:51.862 --> 07:53.951
Also, he's a security guard
off and on,

07:54.038 --> 07:55.562
so he owns his own handcuffs.

07:55.649 --> 07:58.739
Okay. We have an address?

07:58.826 --> 08:01.437
2311, 2313--

08:01.524 --> 08:04.440
It's gonna be right up here.

08:04.527 --> 08:05.789
Hey.

08:05.876 --> 08:08.923
I think I spot him at our two.

08:09.010 --> 08:10.185
Same height, same build.

08:12.883 --> 08:15.495
Yep, that's him.

08:22.980 --> 08:25.417
Stay put.

08:38.039 --> 08:39.519
Whoa!

08:43.610 --> 08:45.873
Norm Carver,
you're under arrest.

08:45.960 --> 08:47.352
Hey! Hey.

08:49.964 --> 08:51.661
I've had enough, okay?
I've had enough.

08:51.748 --> 08:53.358
Do you understand?
- Hey.

08:53.445 --> 08:54.795
Hey, hey, hey.
Is everything okay?

08:54.882 --> 08:56.100
Yeah, everything's fine.

08:56.187 --> 08:58.450
Norm here just doesn't
like to listen.

08:58.538 --> 09:00.452
Let's give him a chance to, OA.

09:04.152 --> 09:06.154
Yeah, okay.

09:06.241 --> 09:08.722
- Are you gonna cooperate?
- Yeah.

09:08.809 --> 09:10.680
Hands behind your back.

09:12.595 --> 09:13.553
Let's go.

09:26.000 --> 09:27.871
No. Don't know her.

09:27.958 --> 09:30.526
You sure?

09:30.613 --> 09:33.050
Sure as I can be
about something like that.

09:33.137 --> 09:34.748
What the hell
is that supposed to mean?

09:34.835 --> 09:36.097
Means I meet lots of women.

09:36.184 --> 09:38.099
Some I remember, some I don't.

09:38.186 --> 09:39.796
Okay.

09:39.883 --> 09:43.626
So just to be clear, you don't
remember ever meeting her?

09:43.713 --> 09:45.410
Correct.

09:45.497 --> 09:46.716
Okay.

09:48.936 --> 09:50.590
Well, this is last week.

09:50.677 --> 09:51.852
That's you and that's Marta.

09:54.202 --> 09:55.986
A man's allowed
to walk down the street.

09:56.073 --> 09:57.335
Why are you lying, Norm?

09:57.422 --> 09:59.076
Lying?

09:59.163 --> 10:00.512
You just said that
you don't know her.

10:00.600 --> 10:01.905
I don't.

10:01.992 --> 10:03.690
Doesn't mean
I've never seen her before.

10:03.777 --> 10:05.909
You might want to rethink
your strategy here.

10:05.996 --> 10:08.782
Okay, we are investigating
a murder.

10:10.697 --> 10:12.133
What are you talking about?

10:12.220 --> 10:14.526
She's dead.
Someone strangled her.

10:14.614 --> 10:17.312
You're on the short list of
people who could have done it.

10:17.399 --> 10:19.793
I--I thought this was about
my outstanding warrants.

10:19.880 --> 10:22.796
I got nothing to do
with any of this.

10:22.883 --> 10:24.449
On my mother.

10:24.536 --> 10:26.321
I'm sure you love
your mother very much,

10:26.408 --> 10:27.844
but we're gonna
need more than that.

10:29.977 --> 10:32.196
Look,
I remember walking home,

10:32.283 --> 10:34.416
and I saw her
near a hair salon.

10:34.503 --> 10:36.853
She was cute,
so I followed her, hoping to,

10:36.940 --> 10:38.942
you know,
start up a conversation.

10:39.029 --> 10:40.161
I'm old-school.

10:40.248 --> 10:41.815
I like to chat up ladies
face to face--

10:41.902 --> 10:44.252
don't like all that swiping
left and right nonsense.

10:44.339 --> 10:46.341
You like to look them
in the eye, is that it?

10:46.428 --> 10:49.213
That's the best part,
seeing the twinkle.

10:49.300 --> 10:52.086
I'm sure you love to watch
the twinkle disappear,

10:52.173 --> 10:53.653
too, right--
the life leave their eyes?

10:53.740 --> 10:55.089
No!

10:55.176 --> 10:56.873
I followed that lady
for a few blocks,

10:56.960 --> 11:00.050
said hello, then I tried
to start up a conversation,

11:00.137 --> 11:01.878
but she was scared,
so I stopped talking

11:01.965 --> 11:03.271
and walked away.

11:03.358 --> 11:05.447
- Because you're a gentleman?
- Exactly.

11:05.534 --> 11:07.275
Gentlemen don't have priors
for stalking

11:07.362 --> 11:09.190
and forceable touching, Norm.

11:09.277 --> 11:10.931
That's all in the past.

11:11.018 --> 11:13.063
I had a crazy ex-girlfriend.

11:13.150 --> 11:15.370
She got wasted
and called the police.

11:15.457 --> 11:17.459
You got a second?

11:22.986 --> 11:24.727
So NYPD just found
another body,

11:24.814 --> 11:26.120
same MO as Marta's murder--

11:26.207 --> 11:27.382
sexual assault, strangulation,

11:27.469 --> 11:28.775
handcuffs on the wrist
this time.

11:28.862 --> 11:31.299
- Time of death?
- An hour ago.

11:31.386 --> 11:33.910
Prince Charming is not our guy.
- Okay, are we sure about that?

11:33.997 --> 11:35.956
I mean, there's more than one
angry white dude in the city.

11:36.043 --> 11:37.740
Yeah, we checked his phone's
location, pulled video.

11:37.827 --> 11:39.394
He was in Bed-Stuy
at the time of Marta's murder,

11:39.481 --> 11:41.222
so he's not our guy.

11:41.309 --> 11:43.137
But I'll make sure he gets
booked on those warrants.

11:43.224 --> 11:44.660
You guys head down
to the scene, okay?

11:44.747 --> 11:47.271
- Okay.
- Thanks.

11:47.358 --> 11:50.318
Female, white, age 27,
name's Andrea Morris.

11:50.405 --> 11:52.886
- Any witnesses?
- No--not yet, anyway.

11:52.973 --> 11:55.192
But we're on it.
We have agents out canvassing.

11:55.279 --> 11:56.759
We got to stop
meeting like this.

11:56.846 --> 11:58.239
- I couldn't agree more.
- What's the matter?

11:58.326 --> 11:59.849
You guys don't have
enough resources?

11:59.936 --> 12:01.503
Forgot how to solve
a simple murder case?

12:01.590 --> 12:04.158
What did you say?

12:04.245 --> 12:05.376
What the hell
are you talking about?

12:05.463 --> 12:07.161
We are doing everything
we can--

12:07.248 --> 12:08.902
everything, do you understand?

12:08.989 --> 12:10.555
- Get out of my face.
- Or what?

12:10.642 --> 12:11.948
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Omar, chill.

12:12.035 --> 12:14.037
Okay. All right.

12:14.124 --> 12:16.953
That's enough. Back off.
- He's out of line.

12:17.040 --> 12:18.346
He's got no right
talking that way.

12:18.433 --> 12:19.826
Yeah, maybe we stop
with the jokes, okay?

12:19.913 --> 12:21.088
We have two dead bodies.

12:28.312 --> 12:29.836
Hey.

12:29.923 --> 12:30.837
What was that all about?

12:30.924 --> 12:32.273
I mean, the guy was joking.

12:32.360 --> 12:34.014
A bad joke, sure, but still.

12:34.101 --> 12:36.451
You do not joke
about stuff like this.

12:36.538 --> 12:37.974
OA's right.

12:38.061 --> 12:39.584
That was out of line.

12:39.671 --> 12:42.587
You good, Omar?

12:42.674 --> 12:44.894
Yeah, I'm fine.

12:49.464 --> 12:51.335
Poor girl.

12:51.422 --> 12:54.251
I can't imagine how scared
she must have felt.

12:54.338 --> 12:56.384
You know, being so alone
and so vulnerable.

12:58.995 --> 13:00.301
This guy knows
what he's doing.

13:00.388 --> 13:03.043
He filed the serial number
off of the handcuffs.

13:05.610 --> 13:08.222
The ADIC is getting anxious,
and the mayor wants

13:08.309 --> 13:09.832
to set up a press conference,
so please,

13:09.919 --> 13:12.356
tell me something good.
- I wish I could.

13:12.443 --> 13:14.576
ERT came up empty
at the second crime scene.

13:14.663 --> 13:16.273
No forensics.

13:16.360 --> 13:17.971
The killer's obviously
using condoms and gloves.

13:18.058 --> 13:19.363
Okay.
What about the handcuffs?

13:19.450 --> 13:21.409
- Still being processed.
- All right.

13:21.496 --> 13:22.540
You two get over
to the crime lab

13:22.627 --> 13:24.586
and light a fire
under their asses.

13:24.673 --> 13:27.589
We have got two murders
in two days and not one clue.

13:27.676 --> 13:30.766
Hmm, hate to say it,
but he's good.

13:30.853 --> 13:33.290
Now, maybe.

13:33.377 --> 13:35.771
What about before?
- What do you mean?

13:35.858 --> 13:37.381
Well, he didn't just
wake up two days ago

13:37.468 --> 13:39.427
and become a killer, right?

13:39.514 --> 13:42.822
This guy had a life before.
So what was he doing?

13:42.909 --> 13:45.476
What kinds of crimes
was he committing?

13:45.563 --> 13:47.348
He didn't go from model citizen
to killer overnight.

13:47.435 --> 13:49.263
Right, he worked his way up
to the big leagues,

13:49.350 --> 13:51.743
started small.
- Harassment, stalking.

13:51.831 --> 13:53.180
Yeah, and then moved on

13:53.267 --> 13:55.051
to more serious crimes,
like rape.

13:55.138 --> 13:56.923
And got better along the way,
learned from his mistakes.

13:57.010 --> 13:58.315
Right.

13:58.402 --> 14:00.013
All right, people,
let's start digging

14:00.100 --> 14:02.232
into recent sexual assault
cases in the Lower East Side.

14:02.319 --> 14:03.973
Scrub any and all
police reports

14:04.060 --> 14:05.148
within the last three months.

14:05.235 --> 14:06.584
Look for victims
that match the profile

14:06.671 --> 14:08.195
of our two recent murder victims.

14:08.282 --> 14:09.631
All right,
grab your hoes and spades.

14:09.718 --> 14:10.501
Get to work.

14:16.943 --> 14:20.250
Detective Chavez,
I don't have a lot of time.

14:20.337 --> 14:21.948
I'm in the middle
of an investigation.

14:22.035 --> 14:23.166
I won't be long, promise.

14:23.253 --> 14:24.864
I just want to go
over your police report,

14:24.951 --> 14:27.605
see if you remember anything
that might be helpful.

14:27.692 --> 14:29.781
What does that mean?

14:29.869 --> 14:31.653
Excuse me?

14:31.740 --> 14:33.394
I told the cop
everything that happened.

14:33.481 --> 14:35.439
I know,
it's just that, sometimes,

14:35.526 --> 14:37.572
people remember things
down the road, you know?

14:37.659 --> 14:39.791
In the moment,
there's so many emotions.

14:39.879 --> 14:43.360
It's like, you can't really
process what just happened.

14:43.447 --> 14:46.320
Yeah, I get it.
I do this for a living.

14:46.407 --> 14:48.757
No, you solve cases
for a living.

14:48.844 --> 14:50.846
It's, uh--it's different.

14:50.933 --> 14:53.544
Okay, well, like I said,
I don't have a lot of time.

14:53.631 --> 14:55.329
You told
the responding officer that

14:55.416 --> 14:57.200
you didn't see either
of the perps' faces.

14:57.287 --> 14:59.376
Is that true?

14:59.463 --> 15:03.076
Of course I did, I--
it just happened fast.

15:03.163 --> 15:05.513
You described the female
assailant as white,

15:05.600 --> 15:08.777
thin build, average height.

15:08.864 --> 15:12.520
Anything else you want to add--
tattoos, scars?

15:12.607 --> 15:14.261
Uh, no.

15:14.348 --> 15:15.827
That's, uh, everything
that I remember.

15:15.915 --> 15:17.829
And the male assailant,

15:17.917 --> 15:19.527
wearing a hoodie,
medium height and build?

15:19.614 --> 15:21.355
That's correct.

15:21.442 --> 15:23.183
And you said neither one
actually attacked you.

15:23.270 --> 15:27.883
They just asked for your wallet
and you handed it over?

15:27.970 --> 15:29.145
Yep.

15:30.799 --> 15:32.105
Hmm.

15:35.064 --> 15:37.980
Look, Omar, these two perps
have been pretty active,

15:38.067 --> 15:39.851
and they're getting more
and more violent too.

15:39.939 --> 15:43.420
They're flashing guns,
pistol-whipping people.

15:43.507 --> 15:45.553
We need to get them
off the streets.

15:45.640 --> 15:47.772
And I wish I could help you.
I really do.

15:47.859 --> 15:50.775
But I saw what I saw.

15:50.862 --> 15:53.039
Would you be willing
to look at some photos?

15:53.126 --> 15:54.649
I told you, I saw what I saw.

15:54.736 --> 15:55.867
I know you didn't get
a good look at their faces,

15:55.955 --> 15:57.347
but sometimes,
seeing a picture stimulates

15:57.434 --> 15:59.088
a victim's recollection.

15:59.175 --> 16:01.177
Helps people remember things
that they wouldn't remember.

16:01.264 --> 16:05.051
Detective, I did not get
a good look at their faces.

16:05.138 --> 16:06.791
Okay?

16:06.878 --> 16:08.793
You can save this
victim self-help crap

16:08.880 --> 16:09.838
for someone else.

16:20.588 --> 16:21.850
This guy is
picking up the pace

16:21.937 --> 16:23.286
and we are no closer
to identifying him.

16:23.373 --> 16:24.157
Where are we at
with the prior police reports?

16:24.244 --> 16:25.941
Any similarities worth chasing?

16:26.028 --> 16:27.987
We might have something.

16:28.074 --> 16:30.902
NYPD filed a report
three weeks ago

16:30.990 --> 16:33.079
about a young woman
who was assaulted.

16:35.385 --> 16:37.083
- Uh-huh.
- Hmm.

16:37.170 --> 16:39.563
Those abrasions certainly look
like they're from restraints.

16:39.650 --> 16:41.261
Who is she and what do we know?

16:41.348 --> 16:44.394
Citra Susanti, 25,
claims a guy in a ski mask

16:44.481 --> 16:46.222
dragged her into an alley,

16:46.309 --> 16:48.050
used a zip tie
to bind her hands.

16:48.137 --> 16:49.225
All right, good.
I mean, zip ties,

16:49.312 --> 16:50.879
not handcuffs,
but close enough.

16:50.966 --> 16:52.359
It still fits
the killer's profile.

16:52.446 --> 16:54.491
- Then what happened?
- Nothing.

16:54.578 --> 16:56.624
According to the report,
she managed to fight him off.

16:56.711 --> 16:58.887
Anyone identified or taken
into custody behind it?

16:58.974 --> 17:01.324
Negative--the cop who wrote
the report noted the victim

17:01.411 --> 17:03.022
was reluctant
to file a complaint.

17:03.109 --> 17:04.545
The only reason she did was,

17:04.632 --> 17:06.112
a witness heard her screaming,
called the police.

17:06.199 --> 17:07.678
Understandable.

17:07.765 --> 17:09.854
It's not easy coming forward
after being attacked.

17:09.941 --> 17:11.421
All right, why don't you two
go talk to this young lady?

17:11.508 --> 17:14.207
Kelly, send them the address.
- Sure.

17:14.294 --> 17:16.035
Maybe she saw something
that'll help.

17:19.299 --> 17:22.563
My memory of that day
is a little foggy, I'm sorry.

17:22.650 --> 17:24.043
I understand.

17:24.130 --> 17:26.001
We just still need
to ask you some questions.

17:26.088 --> 17:27.655
What do you want to know?

17:27.742 --> 17:30.788
Can you tell us what happened
from the beginning?

17:34.531 --> 17:36.925
I was out to dinner
with friends,

17:37.012 --> 17:40.494
and I was walking home
when I saw him.

17:40.581 --> 17:43.540
He just moved toward me.

17:43.627 --> 17:44.715
Did you see his face?

17:44.802 --> 17:47.588
No.
He was wearing a ski mask.

17:47.675 --> 17:49.459
Okay.

17:49.546 --> 17:50.982
What happened next?

17:54.856 --> 17:57.076
He grabbed me.

17:57.163 --> 17:59.513
And then he dragged me
behind a building.

17:59.600 --> 18:02.211
He tried to bind my hands,
so I bit him.

18:02.298 --> 18:05.823
But he had gloves on, so I had
to bite down really hard.

18:05.910 --> 18:07.651
He--he ran away.

18:07.738 --> 18:08.652
Is there a problem?

18:08.739 --> 18:11.177
No, not at all.

18:11.264 --> 18:12.874
We're just trying
to understand what happened.

18:12.961 --> 18:14.180
She just told you.

18:14.267 --> 18:16.399
I know that.

18:16.486 --> 18:19.489
But the crime scene photos
tell a different story.

18:19.576 --> 18:23.667
They show that Citra's wrists
had abrasions.

18:23.754 --> 18:27.628
- Are you saying she's lying?
- No, absolutely not.

18:27.715 --> 18:29.369
We're just saying that
injuries like that

18:29.456 --> 18:31.197
indicate that
she was fully restrained.

18:31.284 --> 18:33.024
What difference does it make?

18:33.112 --> 18:34.374
A man attacked her,
but she's still alive.

18:34.461 --> 18:35.636
End of story.

18:35.723 --> 18:37.899
It's not as simple
as that, ma'am.

18:37.986 --> 18:40.510
We believe the man who attacked
Citra may have also just

18:40.597 --> 18:43.600
killed two other women,
so we were hoping

18:43.687 --> 18:48.997
for some sort of information
to help us identify him.

18:49.084 --> 18:51.086
I just want to be clear, okay?

18:52.914 --> 18:54.176
This man didn't hurt you?

18:54.263 --> 18:55.482
No.

18:55.569 --> 18:58.572
Like I said,
I bit him and he ran.

18:58.659 --> 19:00.748
Okay.

19:00.835 --> 19:03.533
I know you didn't see his face,
but did you see his skin color?

19:03.620 --> 19:07.189
Do you remember his height
or his build, anything?

19:07.276 --> 19:09.104
I remember seeing his wrist.

19:09.191 --> 19:12.586
He was white or light-skinned.

19:12.673 --> 19:16.633
And he was average height
and weight, I think.

19:16.720 --> 19:19.680
It's hard to remember.

19:19.767 --> 19:22.726
I honestly can't remember
a lot about that night.

19:22.813 --> 19:24.075
For the better.

19:27.818 --> 19:30.821
- Can you just--
- We understand.

19:30.908 --> 19:31.909
And we appreciate your help.

19:33.824 --> 19:37.263
If you remember anything else,
please give us a call.

19:43.225 --> 19:44.531
There's more
than she's saying.

19:44.618 --> 19:46.576
It's possible,
but she needs time.

19:46.663 --> 19:49.100
Look, I'm not judging her,
OA, trust me,

19:49.188 --> 19:50.145
but she's holding back.

19:50.232 --> 19:51.973
I can see it in her eyes.

19:52.060 --> 19:53.496
Well, maybe it's pain.

19:53.583 --> 19:55.498
Or maybe it's fear
or humiliation,

19:55.585 --> 19:57.239
or the fact that her parents
are hovering over her,

19:57.326 --> 20:00.460
forcing her to pretend
that it never happened.

20:00.547 --> 20:01.852
All right,
that can't help either.

20:01.939 --> 20:03.158
Right?
- Yeah.

20:03.245 --> 20:05.378
Yeah, you're right, but--
- But what?

20:05.465 --> 20:07.945
But it doesn't mean
that I'm wrong, okay?

20:08.032 --> 20:11.035
And I'm not trying to blame
her or revictimize her.

20:11.122 --> 20:13.690
I'm just frustrated, okay,
because I wanted more answers

20:13.777 --> 20:15.779
so that we can catch
this guy before he hurts

20:15.866 --> 20:16.824
or kills other women.

20:23.570 --> 20:25.615
Still got a killer
on the loose,

20:25.702 --> 20:27.922
so we're hoping for good news
and good news only.

20:28.009 --> 20:30.446
Well, I am doing
my best, but--

20:30.533 --> 20:33.928
Not the start
I was hoping for.

20:34.015 --> 20:35.886
No fingerprints
on the handcuffs.

20:35.973 --> 20:38.672
Did find DNA, but it belongs
to our victim, Andrea Morris.

20:38.759 --> 20:41.718
- So we got nothing.
- Not exactly.

20:41.805 --> 20:43.111
Serial number was filed off,

20:43.198 --> 20:44.286
which initially
made it difficult

20:44.373 --> 20:45.853
to determine the place of sale.

20:45.940 --> 20:47.594
- Initially?
- Yeah.

20:47.681 --> 20:49.770
I remedied it
by using a technique

20:49.857 --> 20:52.120
we normally use on firearms--

20:52.207 --> 20:55.471
applied some reagents,
etched the metal.

20:55.558 --> 20:58.126
The number reappeared.
- Hmm.

20:58.213 --> 20:59.127
We're gonna need
that serial number

20:59.214 --> 21:01.521
to ascertain the seller.

21:01.608 --> 21:03.262
That's nice work.

21:03.349 --> 21:06.917
A slow start,
but finished with a flourish.

21:12.967 --> 21:14.751
Interesting.

21:14.838 --> 21:16.057
I've never been in one
of these stores before.

21:16.144 --> 21:18.755
Me neither.

21:18.842 --> 21:21.105
Special Agent Scola.
This is Special Agent Wallace.

21:21.192 --> 21:22.803
We need to ask you
a few questions.

21:22.890 --> 21:24.457
What about?

21:24.544 --> 21:25.458
A pair of handcuffs
that were sold here

21:25.545 --> 21:27.111
used in a crime.

21:27.198 --> 21:29.462
What kind of crime?

21:29.549 --> 21:32.726
We can't say, but your
cooperation is important.

21:32.813 --> 21:35.337
Look, I'm as pro law
enforcement as they come,

21:35.424 --> 21:37.078
but if you won't tell me
what happened,

21:37.165 --> 21:38.732
I can't help you, can I?

21:38.819 --> 21:40.255
It's simple, sir.

21:40.342 --> 21:41.735
We just need to know who
bought these handcuffs.

21:41.822 --> 21:43.737
And that means
we're gonna need access

21:43.824 --> 21:45.521
to your sales records,
any video footage you have

21:45.608 --> 21:48.524
covering the cash
register area.

21:48.611 --> 21:51.266
Yeah, sorry.
That's not gonna happen.

21:51.353 --> 21:53.268
I mean, my boss would kill me.

21:53.355 --> 21:55.575
The dude is super against any
sort of government overreach.

21:55.662 --> 21:58.534
So unless you got a warrant,
I can't help you.

21:58.621 --> 21:59.579
We do.

22:02.451 --> 22:04.932
- Do you mind if I take a look?
- Please.

22:05.019 --> 22:07.413
You can read it, frame it,

22:07.500 --> 22:10.416
put it on your wall
if you want.

22:10.503 --> 22:12.548
We're not leaving until
we have those records

22:12.635 --> 22:14.681
and that footage.

22:14.768 --> 22:16.813
Are we clear?

22:16.900 --> 22:17.510
Yeah.

22:20.556 --> 22:22.515
Kelly, where are we at
with that surplus store info?

22:22.602 --> 22:24.908
Well, the inventory list
shows only one pair of cuffs

22:24.995 --> 22:26.823
was sold in the past two weeks.

22:26.910 --> 22:28.782
Trouble is, I've been scouring
credit card receipts

22:28.869 --> 22:30.174
and can't find any charges
that matches

22:30.261 --> 22:31.480
the purchase of the cuffs.

22:31.567 --> 22:33.047
Well, maybe he paid in cash.

22:33.134 --> 22:34.875
What about the cameras
covering the cash register?

22:34.962 --> 22:36.920
Yeah, I think
I might have something.

22:37.007 --> 22:39.009
Obviously, there's no audio
to go with the footage.

22:39.096 --> 22:40.097
That's all right.

22:40.184 --> 22:41.272
A picture's worth
a thousand words.

22:41.360 --> 22:42.317
Throw it up.
Let's see this guy.

22:42.404 --> 22:44.580
Well, it's not a guy.

22:49.193 --> 22:51.152
Does she pop on facial rec?

22:51.239 --> 22:53.241
Yes.
Got an immediate hit.

22:53.328 --> 22:56.200
Barbie Simmons, 35,

22:56.287 --> 22:59.116
has two prior arrests
for solicitation.

22:59.203 --> 23:00.814
What else do we know
about Barbie?

23:00.901 --> 23:03.512
Um, arrests were made
by undercover vice cops

23:03.599 --> 23:06.863
conducting sex-for-hire stings.

23:06.950 --> 23:10.780
She apparently specializes
in bondage and roleplaying.

23:10.867 --> 23:12.434
Hmm.
Do we have an address on her?

23:12.521 --> 23:14.871
Yes, an apartment
over in Queens.

23:14.958 --> 23:16.699
All right, well, obviously
she's not our rapist,

23:16.786 --> 23:18.353
but send Tiff and Scola over nonetheless.

23:18.440 --> 23:19.354
Yeah.

23:25.404 --> 23:27.754
FBI, open the door.

23:27.841 --> 23:30.060
Jubal says her phone is
still pinging at this location.

23:30.147 --> 23:31.888
Come on, Barbie.

23:31.975 --> 23:32.976
You can open it up,
or we can kick it down.

23:33.063 --> 23:35.196
It's your choice.

23:35.283 --> 23:36.719
What's going on?

23:36.806 --> 23:38.068
The woman who stays here,
you seen her today?

23:38.155 --> 23:39.505
No, sorry.

23:39.592 --> 23:40.984
And where's the super stay?

23:41.071 --> 23:42.464
You're looking at him.

23:42.551 --> 23:44.988
- You got the key?
- Sure do.

23:50.124 --> 23:51.647
FBI.

23:55.695 --> 23:57.697
Barbie Simmons?

23:57.784 --> 23:59.960
Anybody home?

24:07.750 --> 24:09.186
The closet's clear.

24:18.805 --> 24:19.675
We got a body.

24:25.202 --> 24:27.030
I'm guessing that's Barbie.

24:33.863 --> 24:36.126
Death appears to be
from a violent strangulation,

24:36.213 --> 24:38.825
and based on the advanced
levels of decomposition,

24:38.912 --> 24:42.132
I'd estimate she was killed
about two weeks ago.

24:42.219 --> 24:45.745
Hard to determine exactly when
until I get her on the table.

24:45.832 --> 24:47.311
What about the trauma
to her face?

24:47.398 --> 24:49.009
Was that before or after death?

24:49.096 --> 24:52.229
Looks like it was
inflicted post-mortem.

24:52.316 --> 24:53.404
Son of a bitch
couldn't get enough

24:53.492 --> 24:54.928
even after she was dead.

24:56.843 --> 24:59.019
Probably got upset
she died, so he got angry

24:59.106 --> 25:01.282
and started punching her.

25:01.369 --> 25:04.285
Who knows what was
in this guy's head.

25:04.372 --> 25:06.200
The good news is,
looks like he left behind

25:06.287 --> 25:08.768
some leather fragments.

25:08.855 --> 25:10.857
- So he was wearing gloves?
- It appears that way.

25:10.944 --> 25:12.815
I'll run them for DNA.

25:12.902 --> 25:15.339
It's a long shot,
but uh, you never know.

25:15.426 --> 25:16.863
Thanks, Neil.

25:19.213 --> 25:21.171
- Any luck with ERT?
- Nothing.

25:21.258 --> 25:23.391
No working security cameras
in the building.

25:23.478 --> 25:25.175
They think that the suspect
wiped the apartment down

25:25.262 --> 25:26.699
with liquid bleach.

25:26.786 --> 25:29.266
They found a bottle discarded
in the kitchen.

25:29.353 --> 25:31.399
He left the windows open,
too, to air it out

25:31.486 --> 25:32.618
and delay the discovery.

25:32.705 --> 25:34.663
This guy's always thinking.

25:34.750 --> 25:36.317
Well, it's time to stop
admiring his work

25:36.404 --> 25:37.971
and nail his ass.

25:39.973 --> 25:43.150
Yeah, I appreciate it.

25:43.237 --> 25:45.413
Okay, so the medical examiner
just confirmed

25:45.500 --> 25:48.329
that Barbie Simmons was killed
approximately 12 days ago.

25:48.416 --> 25:51.375
So that makes her
our first victim.

25:51.462 --> 25:52.942
Okay.

25:53.029 --> 25:54.291
Where are we
with the leather fibers?

25:54.378 --> 25:56.685
Uh, they found two samples,
one was Barbie Simmons,

25:56.772 --> 25:58.644
and the other one
was an unknown female

25:58.731 --> 26:00.994
of Southeast Asian descent.

26:01.081 --> 26:03.126
- So we're thinking Citra?
- I mean, it has to be.

26:03.213 --> 26:05.346
She said she bit down hard
on her attacker's glove.

26:05.433 --> 26:07.957
Hey, uh, there's
a Detective Chavez

26:08.044 --> 26:09.480
waiting in the boardroom,
says he wants to talk to you

26:09.568 --> 26:11.352
about a photo array.

26:11.439 --> 26:12.919
A photo array?

26:13.006 --> 26:15.574
Uh, yeah,
unrelated to this case.

26:20.883 --> 26:22.798
You couldn't call before
showing up, detective?

26:22.885 --> 26:25.192
Tried. You didn't pick up.

26:25.279 --> 26:27.629
That is because I am in the
middle of an active case.

26:27.716 --> 26:30.110
So am I.

26:30.197 --> 26:32.460
Patrol units just called me
a few minutes ago.

26:32.547 --> 26:34.114
Looks like the two perps
that attacked you

26:34.201 --> 26:35.724
just robbed another guy.

26:35.811 --> 26:37.117
Okay. You can talk to him.

26:37.204 --> 26:39.946
Can't. They shot him.

26:40.033 --> 26:41.251
What?

26:41.338 --> 26:43.166
He's in bad shape, too.

26:43.253 --> 26:45.691
On the operating table
as we speak.

26:45.778 --> 26:48.258
So with all due respect,
showing up unannounced

26:48.345 --> 26:50.304
isn't my biggest concern.

26:50.391 --> 26:51.827
You are correct.

26:51.914 --> 26:55.222
My apologies. I am sorry.

26:55.309 --> 26:57.528
I put together a photo array
of potential suspects

26:57.616 --> 26:58.617
hoping you'll take a look.

26:58.704 --> 27:00.227
Might jog your memory.

27:00.314 --> 27:01.794
It's called guided
visualization--

27:01.881 --> 27:03.622
pictures, objects, locations.

27:03.709 --> 27:06.407
Seeing them sometimes
jogs repressed memories.

27:09.845 --> 27:11.107
Give it a shot, Omar.

27:12.805 --> 27:14.415
What's the harm in looking?

27:18.027 --> 27:21.248
Um, I will.

27:21.335 --> 27:22.684
I'm a little distracted
right now.

27:22.771 --> 27:25.078
We just got a lead on our
serial killer, but today.

27:26.993 --> 27:29.430
I promise, you have my word.

27:29.517 --> 27:30.736
I appreciate that, Omar.

27:30.823 --> 27:32.825
No, thank you.

27:35.001 --> 27:35.871
Thank you.

27:38.134 --> 27:39.658
- Hey.
- Hey, what's going on?

27:39.745 --> 27:41.007
Nothing.

27:41.094 --> 27:42.617
Come on, don't do that.

27:44.924 --> 27:46.969
- Do what?
- Pretend like nothing's wrong.

27:47.056 --> 27:49.493
I'm your partner. Just tell me.

27:54.063 --> 27:56.805
Two punks tried
to rob me this morning.

27:56.892 --> 27:58.546
The detective has some photos.

27:58.633 --> 28:00.679
He wants me to take a look,
see if I can identify anybody,

28:00.766 --> 28:02.506
but like I told him
this morning,

28:02.593 --> 28:05.727
I didn't get a good look,
because it was not a big deal.

28:05.814 --> 28:07.686
Okay,
well, I'm sorry that you--

28:07.773 --> 28:09.949
OA, where are you going?

28:10.036 --> 28:11.341
I want to go talk
to Citra again,

28:11.428 --> 28:12.865
alone this time,
if you don't mind.

28:12.952 --> 28:14.257
The detective gave me
a new angle

28:14.344 --> 28:15.955
that we haven't tried yet.

28:16.042 --> 28:17.130
I think it can work.

28:17.217 --> 28:18.522
Okay.

28:24.790 --> 28:26.356
I don't know what else
I can tell you.

28:26.443 --> 28:28.010
My memory of that night
is limited.

28:28.097 --> 28:29.446
I'm sure that it is.

28:29.533 --> 28:30.970
But like I said,
the man that attacked you

28:31.057 --> 28:32.885
killed three other women.

28:32.972 --> 28:34.103
This is important.

28:34.190 --> 28:36.149
I get it, I do.

28:36.236 --> 28:37.672
But I never saw
the person's face,

28:37.759 --> 28:41.067
and I already told you
what I remember.

28:41.154 --> 28:43.243
I know.

28:43.330 --> 28:46.899
But maybe we can try again,
because Citra, sometimes,

28:46.986 --> 28:49.379
when something
like this happens,

28:49.466 --> 28:51.991
your brain plays
a trick on you.

28:52.078 --> 28:55.777
Like it deletes some memory
so that you don't have to deal

28:55.864 --> 28:58.562
with what really happened,
so that you don't have to talk

28:58.649 --> 29:00.913
about it with your friends
or your family,

29:01.000 --> 29:03.567
and feel the embarrassment
or the judgment,

29:03.654 --> 29:07.441
as if, somehow, you getting
attacked was your fault.

29:07.528 --> 29:09.660
I know what you mean.

29:09.748 --> 29:13.316
I keep replaying that night,
wondering why he picked me.

29:13.403 --> 29:14.753
I know.

29:14.840 --> 29:17.190
I get it, trust me, but

29:17.277 --> 29:20.367
you know that this was not
your fault, right?

29:20.454 --> 29:22.891
No, I don't.

29:22.978 --> 29:25.415
I--I was in
inappropriate clothing.

29:25.502 --> 29:27.853
No.

29:27.940 --> 29:30.594
There is no such thing. Okay?

29:30.681 --> 29:32.074
You can wear whatever you want,
wherever you want to.

29:32.161 --> 29:34.120
It was sinful.

29:36.470 --> 29:40.779
Even if it was,
okay, the Koran says,

29:40.866 --> 29:42.258
we are all forgiven
our trespass,

29:42.345 --> 29:45.392
and that we must
tell the truth.

29:45.479 --> 29:46.959
Right?

29:47.046 --> 29:49.135
So now that we are here,

29:49.222 --> 29:54.836
in the place
where he first grabbed you,

29:54.923 --> 29:56.316
I need you to try
and remember that night

29:56.403 --> 29:57.404
one more time.

30:01.756 --> 30:04.759
- I don't want to.
- Please?

30:04.846 --> 30:07.022
Just try.

30:07.109 --> 30:09.677
It's called
guided visualization.

30:09.764 --> 30:11.331
And I think it might help.

30:30.698 --> 30:34.180
He didn't just grab me.

30:34.267 --> 30:38.532
He tried to assault me
s--sexually.

30:38.619 --> 30:42.928
He--he zip tied me
and pushed me to the ground,

30:43.015 --> 30:46.932
and he--he took his pants off.

30:49.630 --> 30:51.197
But then I bit him.

30:51.284 --> 30:53.329
And I scratched him too.

30:53.416 --> 30:55.723
I must have cut him,
because later, when I got home,

30:55.810 --> 30:57.420
I saw his blood on my blouse.

30:59.335 --> 31:01.381
He got his blood
on your shirt?

31:04.775 --> 31:07.387
Did you wash it?
- No.

31:07.474 --> 31:08.997
It's at the bottom
of my closet.

31:10.956 --> 31:12.479
That's really good, Citra.

31:14.437 --> 31:15.743
Citra, thank you.

31:17.832 --> 31:18.746
Thank you.

31:21.531 --> 31:23.533
The lab is running the blood
on Citra's blouse.

31:23.620 --> 31:25.579
We should know something soon.
- Fingers crossed.

31:25.666 --> 31:27.450
Hey, do you really think
that she didn't remember

31:27.537 --> 31:30.105
until today, or she just
didn't want to talk about it?

31:30.192 --> 31:32.978
Uh, I don't know.

31:33.065 --> 31:34.675
Maybe both.

31:34.762 --> 31:36.633
But I'm gonna go
talk to Chavez.

31:36.720 --> 31:38.418
Yeah?

31:38.505 --> 31:40.463
I thought you said
you didn't get a good look.

31:40.550 --> 31:42.161
I didn't.

31:42.248 --> 31:45.207
Nina, I didn't,
or I didn't think I did,

31:45.294 --> 31:48.863
but after talking
to Citra, I got to try.

31:48.950 --> 31:52.562
Yeah, maybe you just
needed more time.

31:52.649 --> 31:55.348
It's not easy being a victim.

31:55.435 --> 31:57.480
Really messes with the way
you see things.

31:59.526 --> 32:03.182
I'm not trying to upset you.
I--

32:03.269 --> 32:04.139
It's not that.

32:06.272 --> 32:08.883
What?

32:08.970 --> 32:11.146
The perps that mugged me
shot someone.

32:13.018 --> 32:14.802
He's in critical condition.

32:14.889 --> 32:18.545
The detective doesn't know
if he's gonna make it, and...

32:18.632 --> 32:22.070
he's got a family, and--

32:22.157 --> 32:25.073
Hey, go easy on yourself.

32:25.160 --> 32:28.207
You were mugged.
And you are a victim.

32:28.294 --> 32:30.339
And I don't care who you are
or what you do,

32:30.426 --> 32:32.733
that's really heavy stuff.

32:42.656 --> 32:43.352
There.

32:45.572 --> 32:47.748
That's him.

32:47.835 --> 32:49.793
You sure?

32:49.880 --> 32:50.751
I'm positive.

32:53.014 --> 32:54.189
Okay. Good.

32:57.714 --> 33:00.369
And that is her,
the female perp.

33:00.456 --> 33:01.762
No doubt about it.

33:05.113 --> 33:07.028
These were the two
we've been tracking.

33:07.115 --> 33:08.377
We just wanted
one more positive ID

33:08.464 --> 33:10.989
before getting a warrant.

33:11.076 --> 33:14.122
I'm sorry that
it took so long.

33:14.209 --> 33:16.429
Is what it is.

33:16.516 --> 33:18.344
The victim that
they shot, how is he?

33:18.431 --> 33:19.780
I'm not sure.

33:19.867 --> 33:21.608
The last I checked,
he was in rough shape--

33:21.695 --> 33:24.611
touch and go.

33:24.698 --> 33:26.787
Thanks for your help, Omar.
- Yeah.

33:31.487 --> 33:33.968
Thank you.
Hey, DNA came back.

33:34.055 --> 33:36.057
We got a hit.

33:36.144 --> 33:39.234
Looks like this son of a bitch
was hiding in plain sight.

33:39.321 --> 33:41.454
It's the clerk
from the surplus store.

33:51.594 --> 33:53.031
FBI.

33:53.118 --> 33:55.033
Hands where we can see them.

33:55.120 --> 33:57.209
Federal agents.

33:57.296 --> 33:58.384
Where's Jason?
- Why? He in trouble?

33:58.471 --> 33:59.559
- Answer the question.
- He left.

33:59.646 --> 34:01.648
He got off shift like,
ten minutes ago.

34:01.735 --> 34:03.563
- On foot?
- Yeah.

34:03.650 --> 34:04.912
- What direction did he go in?
- I'm not sure.

34:04.999 --> 34:06.783
He's not here.

34:06.870 --> 34:09.221
I saw him talking to a girl
shopping for some cargo pants.

34:09.308 --> 34:11.353
- Did she leave with him?
- I guess.

34:11.440 --> 34:13.268
I got a little busy,
but definitely looked like

34:13.355 --> 34:15.140
they were vibing, so probably.

34:15.227 --> 34:16.445
Jubal, Jason's not here.

34:16.532 --> 34:17.968
He left with a girl
about ten minutes ago.

34:18.056 --> 34:19.535
Copy that. Standby.

34:19.622 --> 34:20.971
Elise, when you pinged
Jason's phone,

34:21.059 --> 34:22.364
he was at the
surplus store, right?

34:22.451 --> 34:24.671
Yes, or at least
in that general area.

34:24.758 --> 34:26.673
Yeah. Can you ping it again?

34:26.760 --> 34:28.544
Cell coverage in that area
is a little spotty,

34:28.631 --> 34:30.677
so I can't give you
an exact location,

34:30.764 --> 34:32.026
but it shows he's still
within a few hundred yards

34:32.113 --> 34:33.636
of the surplus store.

34:33.723 --> 34:36.335
OA, his cell is still pinging
off the same tower,

34:36.422 --> 34:39.120
so he's still
somewhere in that area.

34:39.207 --> 34:41.514
Copy that. Okay.
Let's split up.

34:41.601 --> 34:42.863
Check restaurants, bodegas,
anywhere this guy

34:42.950 --> 34:43.864
could be with this girl, yeah?

34:47.607 --> 34:50.262
Excuse me, sir?
Have you seen this person?

34:50.349 --> 34:52.133
- No.
- All right.

35:01.360 --> 35:04.014
Excuse me?
Have you seen this guy?

35:21.510 --> 35:22.511
Guys, I just heard
a woman scream

35:22.598 --> 35:24.078
one block east
of the surplus store.

35:24.165 --> 35:26.994
I'm checking it out now.
- Okay. Copy that. On my way.

35:28.952 --> 35:30.911
I think it came from one
of the shipping containers.

35:30.998 --> 35:32.347
I'm right behind you.

35:35.524 --> 35:37.570
Shut up! Shut up!

35:37.657 --> 35:40.007
Hey! FBI!

35:40.094 --> 35:42.183
Show me your hands!

35:42.270 --> 35:43.880
Here's here, guys. Send backup.

35:43.967 --> 35:45.012
Help is coming.

35:45.099 --> 35:46.883
Hey. I got her. Go.

35:58.417 --> 36:00.941
Let's get these off.
I got you, okay?

36:01.028 --> 36:03.117
It's all right.

36:09.863 --> 36:11.604
<i>NYPD is arriving
on the scene.</i>

36:11.691 --> 36:13.214
They should have it contained
in the next few minutes.

36:13.301 --> 36:15.085
Where are you exactly?

36:17.218 --> 36:18.828
I'm in the rear
of the warehouse.

36:18.915 --> 36:20.090
I lost sight of the suspect,

36:20.178 --> 36:21.788
but he's got to be
in here somewhere.

36:21.875 --> 36:24.007
Hold your position.
We're headed towards you.

37:15.233 --> 37:16.799
What's the matter, Jason?

37:16.886 --> 37:18.279
You don't like being
on the other side of this?

37:18.366 --> 37:21.021
Hey, hey, hey!
OA, OA, OA!

37:21.108 --> 37:22.240
Enough, enough, enough.

37:22.327 --> 37:24.285
Back off.
- Okay, okay, okay.

37:24.372 --> 37:25.286
You got him.
You got him.

37:27.419 --> 37:29.812
- I got him.
- You got him. It's good.

37:37.559 --> 37:39.213
- Is the girl okay?
- Yeah, she's fine.

37:39.300 --> 37:42.608
Come on. Take a breather.
It's over.

37:46.916 --> 37:49.049
You did good.

37:49.136 --> 37:50.833
Thank God you got
the bloody shirt

37:50.920 --> 37:53.706
from Citra, otherwise that girl
would have been dead.

37:53.793 --> 37:55.403
I could have
gotten it earlier.

37:57.318 --> 37:58.754
If she didn't block it out.

37:58.841 --> 38:00.713
If she gave it to us earlier.
- Hey. Hey.

38:00.800 --> 38:02.628
No. Don't say that.

38:02.715 --> 38:03.672
It's the truth.

38:08.286 --> 38:10.375
If she gave NYPD
the bloody shirt

38:10.462 --> 38:13.508
at the beginning, if she--

38:13.595 --> 38:17.120
if she remembered,
then three other girls

38:17.207 --> 38:18.339
would be alive right now.

38:18.426 --> 38:19.862
She did the best
that she could.

38:19.949 --> 38:22.865
She was humiliated
and traumatized

38:22.952 --> 38:24.476
and scared to tell the people
that she loves

38:24.563 --> 38:27.653
what actually happened to her.

38:27.740 --> 38:29.219
OA.

38:32.832 --> 38:35.095
I think she's amazing.

38:35.182 --> 38:36.662
And I don't blame her,

38:36.749 --> 38:38.359
not one minute,
for what happened.

38:40.927 --> 38:42.537
Okay,
she worked through her pain

38:42.624 --> 38:45.279
and her fear and her anger,

38:45.366 --> 38:48.238
and she found the courage to
remember what happened to her.

38:59.162 --> 39:00.207
You're right.

39:03.776 --> 39:05.255
Thank you.

39:18.399 --> 39:20.053
Hi, I'm looking for a patient

39:20.140 --> 39:22.360
who sustained a gunshot
injury earlier today.

39:22.447 --> 39:24.274
I'm not sure his name.

39:24.362 --> 39:27.277
Um, Peter Atkins.

39:27.365 --> 39:28.714
And he's still here?

39:28.801 --> 39:32.587
He's in the ICU,
recovery room 4A.

39:32.674 --> 39:35.155
Okay.
Any idea how he's doing?

39:35.242 --> 39:36.548
No, I'm sorry.

39:36.635 --> 39:38.419
All right, thank you.

39:52.302 --> 39:53.608
What are you doing here?

39:57.003 --> 39:59.179
I, uh, I just wanted
to make sure that he was okay.

39:59.266 --> 40:01.268
What about you?

40:01.355 --> 40:03.792
We just collared the perps.

40:03.879 --> 40:05.664
I just came here
to deliver the good news.

40:07.056 --> 40:08.580
Nice.

40:12.975 --> 40:15.021
End of the day,
we're just people.

40:15.108 --> 40:16.414
Badge or no badge.

40:16.501 --> 40:19.112
You know what I mean?

40:19.199 --> 40:20.200
Yeah.
