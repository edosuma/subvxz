at the coffee machine,

13:56.125 --> 13:59.416
you wait until Steph is there
before you pitch me the cream.

14:02.333 --> 14:05.791
I am a survivor.

14:05.791 --> 14:09.375
And I will do whatever it takes

14:09.375 --> 14:12.875
to avoid my fate.

14:12.875 --> 14:16.833
Ask yourselves...

14:16.833 --> 14:18.500
Are you?

14:18.500 --> 14:21.500
You have an amazing
level of insight

14:21.500 --> 14:23.291
into how we hedgies think.

14:23.291 --> 14:26.416
Well, if I didn't
after the time I put in --

14:26.416 --> 14:28.916
With Axe.

14:28.916 --> 14:30.000
Yes.

14:30.000 --> 14:33.291
I don't mean Axe Capital.
I mean Bobby himself.

14:35.416 --> 14:37.041
You've had sessions with him.

14:37.041 --> 14:39.875
You must understand
at a molecular level almost

14:39.875 --> 14:42.125
why he does what he does.

14:42.125 --> 14:45.041
Well, I'm not talking about
a rising market.

14:45.041 --> 14:46.791
I mean,
we all know how to trade

14:46.791 --> 14:48.333
once we get
a little mo-mo going.

14:48.333 --> 14:50.708
But when things
get a little choppy,

14:50.708 --> 14:52.041
does he steer into the skid

14:52.041 --> 14:54.333
or does he retreat to
look at alternatives?

14:56.458 --> 14:59.125
I thought
you'd overpaid me.

14:59.125 --> 15:01.500
But if that's what
you're really looking for,

15:01.500 --> 15:03.666
you weren't even
close to the number.

15:03.666 --> 15:05.666
The number doesn't exist.

15:05.666 --> 15:07.958
I'd never sell him out.

15:09.750 --> 15:11.833
You passed the test.

15:11.833 --> 15:14.666
Ah. Do I get the whole
chocolate factory now?

15:14.666 --> 15:16.416
Yes, you do.

15:16.416 --> 15:18.791
I thought I wanted to
bring you on full time,

15:18.791 --> 15:20.541
but now that I know
I can trust you,

15:20.541 --> 15:22.166
I'm certain I do.

15:22.166 --> 15:25.083
Well...

15:25.083 --> 15:27.583
that makes one of us,
Todd.

15:27.583 --> 15:29.625
I'm already set up
in an office of my own

15:29.625 --> 15:30.916
starting to see clients.

15:30.916 --> 15:32.125
Is that permanent?

15:32.125 --> 15:34.666
I'm not sure. Yet.

15:34.666 --> 15:37.000
I'm keeping my options open.

15:37.000 --> 15:39.166
Is that a lie?

15:41.083 --> 15:43.500
I hope not.

15:43.500 --> 15:48.083
Anyway, why don't you just
keep an open mind,

15:48.083 --> 15:52.291
and let's find something
to collaborate on soon, okay?

15:52.291 --> 15:55.375
♪ suspenseful music plays  ♪

16:04.458 --> 16:07.458
I have information.

16:07.458 --> 16:09.166
-Got your homework ready?
-Yep.

16:09.166 --> 16:11.333
All right. I got to
drop some papers off

16:11.333 --> 16:14.208
at the development office.
I'll see you guys at pickup.

16:14.208 --> 16:15.625
-Okay.
-Have a good day.

16:15.625 --> 16:17.333
-Bye, Mom.
-Bye.

16:19.791 --> 16:22.166
Help! Help!
Katie fell on the floor!

16:25.833 --> 16:27.583
-What's going on?
-I'm calling 911.

16:27.583 --> 16:29.583
-What happened?
-She came in with nausea,

16:29.583 --> 16:31.916
threw up in my office.
She's having a seizure.

16:31.916 --> 16:33.708
She's in anaphylaxis.

16:33.708 --> 16:35.041
Epi-pen.

16:35.041 --> 16:36.166
That's why hysterical moms
aren't school nurses.

16:36.166 --> 16:37.750
We don't give adrenaline
unless the allergy --

16:37.750 --> 16:40.166
She needs a rescue shot.
She carries one.

16:40.166 --> 16:42.916
I need an ambulance to
the Horace School right away,

16:42.916 --> 16:44.333
- please.

16:44.333 --> 16:46.166
Okay.
All right.

16:46.166 --> 16:48.208
- Okay, honey.

16:48.208 --> 16:49.750
Listen,
you're having a reaction,

16:49.750 --> 16:53.458
but I got you, all right?
Just breathe for me.

17:01.333 --> 17:02.541
Michael, thank you.

17:02.541 --> 17:04.500
Why don't you go
walk the perimeter?

17:11.166 --> 17:13.166
Word out of Washington

17:13.166 --> 17:16.208
is that Rhoades' misconduct
is being investigated.

17:16.208 --> 17:19.000
You somehow
put that in motion?

17:19.000 --> 17:22.625
Look, when an enemy's down
on the field,

17:22.625 --> 17:24.083
you got to finish him.

17:24.083 --> 17:26.208
If this investigation
hurts him,

17:26.208 --> 17:28.041
we got to take it
the rest of the way.

17:28.041 --> 17:30.166
He's really in your head.

17:30.166 --> 17:33.458
As long as Rhoades is
in that job, I'm not safe.

17:33.458 --> 17:36.166
Hall,
I want your guys all over it.

17:36.166 --> 17:38.791
Bach, I want to file a lawsuit
against him immediately.

17:38.791 --> 17:41.166
A smart woman once said,

17:41.166 --> 17:44.083
"You can no more win a war
than an earthquake."

17:44.083 --> 17:46.500
It's what's called for.
How long to prepare it?

17:49.083 --> 17:52.500
Bobby,
détente can be good.

17:52.500 --> 17:55.333
Like after the armistice,

17:55.333 --> 17:58.625
the Europeans back in the cafés,
drinking wine.

17:58.625 --> 18:00.125
-Making love.
-Yeah.

18:00.125 --> 18:03.041
And if they would have known
the Germans were laying in wait,

18:03.041 --> 18:06.125
arming up again, they would have
been better off crushing them

18:06.125 --> 18:08.833
-when they had the chance.
-With a suit comes publicity.

18:08.833 --> 18:10.208
Everything that happened

18:10.208 --> 18:12.916
gets dragged back through
the press, re-litigated.

18:12.916 --> 18:15.541
You get called a criminal
every single day.

18:15.541 --> 18:18.041
Instead of how it is now?

18:18.041 --> 18:20.333
With the murky suggestion
hanging over me,

18:20.333 --> 18:22.125
looming over
every encounter?

18:22.125 --> 18:24.958
Look, lots of people
he's crossed swords with

18:24.958 --> 18:27.125
have gone away
stuck and steaming.

18:27.125 --> 18:28.625
Most can't even get a lawyer

18:28.625 --> 18:30.875
to take on an individual case
of this nature.

18:30.875 --> 18:32.166
You know why?

18:32.166 --> 18:33.666
The downside's too steep

18:33.666 --> 18:35.875
and the upside's
too hard to see.

18:35.875 --> 18:38.083
And if you still hope
to get Wendy back somehow,

18:38.083 --> 18:39.708
I don't see how this can help.

18:39.708 --> 18:42.166
You said you had some
information on that front.

18:42.166 --> 18:44.125
Wendy and Rhoades
remain separated.

18:44.125 --> 18:45.375
Where is he living?

18:45.375 --> 18:46.791
The house.

18:46.791 --> 18:49.125
Part of the time.

18:49.125 --> 18:50.666
She is, too,
part of the time.

18:50.666 --> 18:52.916
-How?
-They call it nesting.

18:52.916 --> 18:54.541
It's bullshit.

18:54.541 --> 18:57.250
I tried it for a few weeks
between wives two and three.

18:57.250 --> 18:59.166
Yes,
the parents trade nights.

18:59.166 --> 19:01.250
The children stay
in the familial home.

19:01.250 --> 19:03.916
A utopian idea
that's supposed to

19:03.916 --> 19:06.500
impart a feeling of well-being
in the young ones

19:06.500 --> 19:10.083
during a turbulent time.
-Like I said, bullshit.

19:10.083 --> 19:12.833
And Wendy was at Krakow Capital
earlier today.

19:12.833 --> 19:15.041
-What? That fucker's hired her?
-Unclear.

19:15.041 --> 19:16.416
If we're not getting her back,

19:16.416 --> 19:18.916
I've heard about this guy,
Lenny Gustaferson --

19:18.916 --> 19:21.000
Dr. Gus.
He is supposed to be badass.

19:21.000 --> 19:24.000
I can't believe
she's considering Krakow.

19:24.000 --> 19:26.791
That's a bucket shop.

19:26.791 --> 19:29.041
I want to know where
she's working,

19:29.041 --> 19:30.666
the hours.

19:30.666 --> 19:33.708
Hold off on that Gus guy
until I say.

19:33.708 --> 19:36.041
Good.

19:37.291 --> 19:39.666
I know Katie.
I know that she has the allergy.

19:39.666 --> 19:42.125
How does a mother passing by
know more than her?

19:42.125 --> 19:44.166
I can't administer
serious medication

19:44.166 --> 19:45.291
just because
some rich lady

19:45.291 --> 19:47.166
-stopped --
-Stop talking.

19:47.166 --> 19:50.166
Topher, I am not leaving my kids
in the care of this idiot.

19:50.166 --> 19:51.416
Are you gonna do it now,

19:51.416 --> 19:53.625
or do I have to call
the rest of the board?

19:53.625 --> 19:56.166
I get it, Lara, but we can't
do this thing bang-bang.

19:56.166 --> 19:59.000
I need a licensed nurse
on premises at all times.

20:01.125 --> 20:03.083
Hey, Mo. It's Lara.

20:03.083 --> 20:05.291
Look, I know
you're working nights,

20:05.291 --> 20:06.875
but I need your help.

20:06.875 --> 20:10.041
Can you come do a shift here
at the Horace School right now?

20:10.041 --> 20:12.041
Oh, you're the best.

20:12.041 --> 20:14.625
My cousin will be here
in 45 minutes.

20:14.625 --> 20:15.958
I'll cover until then.

20:15.958 --> 20:18.416
Fully licensed.

20:20.041 --> 20:21.500
Bye.

20:28.125 --> 20:31.250
It'll take a long time
to fill Bart Schooner's seat

20:31.250 --> 20:33.333
as head of criminal prosecution.

20:33.333 --> 20:37.250
- Oh, at least 15 minutes...

20:37.250 --> 20:39.083
...until someone with
a law degree

20:39.083 --> 20:42.625
and a controlled drinking habit
stumbles in.

20:42.625 --> 20:44.041
Let me -- Let me get serious.

20:44.041 --> 20:48.291
I just want to talk
about Bart's...

20:48.291 --> 20:50.083
Head of Crim. Man.

20:50.083 --> 20:51.666
Plum perch.

20:51.666 --> 20:53.750
Freaking launch pad
to the private sector.

20:53.750 --> 20:55.833
I mean, you land it,
you're minted.

20:55.833 --> 20:58.000
Seven figures
the day you leave.

20:58.000 --> 20:59.333
How the hell
do you get it?

20:59.333 --> 21:01.833
There's 75 AUSAs in here
all going after it.

21:01.833 --> 21:04.083
You got to pay your dues.

21:04.083 --> 21:07.958
Yeah.
Big cases, ingeniously won.

21:07.958 --> 21:11.750
After years
of dutiful service.

21:11.750 --> 21:13.375
- Years and years.

21:13.375 --> 21:15.333
So I'm too young?

21:15.333 --> 21:17.083
You're getting that?

21:17.083 --> 21:18.958
Too green.

21:18.958 --> 21:21.416
It'll go to an old hand
like one of you two, then?

21:21.416 --> 21:23.291
"Experienced", not "old".

21:23.291 --> 21:25.958
- Seasoned.

21:25.958 --> 21:28.000
I'm out of scotch.

21:28.000 --> 21:31.166
See, I order two at a time
at these things

21:31.166 --> 21:34.166
because the waiters disappear
like Houdini after the entrées.

21:34.166 --> 21:35.958
You got to know that.
Plan ahead.

21:35.958 --> 21:37.666
Smart. Seasoned.

21:37.666 --> 21:39.041
Souses.

21:39.041 --> 21:40.375
What I'd like to know is,

21:40.375 --> 21:42.875
will Chuck still be the one
handing out the job?

21:44.333 --> 21:46.500
-The investigation.
-Hell yeah.

21:46.500 --> 21:48.791
They say Dake rides in
on a pale horse.

21:48.791 --> 21:51.125
What do you think
he's got on Chuck?

21:51.125 --> 21:53.333
Well, well, well.
Three young apprentices

21:53.333 --> 21:55.666
celebrating the departure
of a colleague.

21:57.083 --> 21:59.625
Sure.
But don't they also want to

21:59.625 --> 22:01.625
put a foot in his ass
and take his spot?

22:01.625 --> 22:03.458
Hmm?

22:03.458 --> 22:05.208
Oh, come on.

22:06.500 --> 22:09.291
You know Head of Crim
is the hyperloop

22:09.291 --> 22:12.833
that propels you into
whatever job you want next.

22:12.833 --> 22:14.791
How to get it --

22:14.791 --> 22:16.791
Let me tell you.

22:16.791 --> 22:21.083
Our practices
leave grooves over time.

22:21.083 --> 22:24.125
And eventually,
those grooves become walls

22:24.125 --> 22:26.791
that box us in.

22:26.791 --> 22:30.916
So what I figured out
recently is,

22:30.916 --> 22:32.125
find another way.

22:32.125 --> 22:35.541
♪ tense music  ♪

22:35.541 --> 22:39.083
I found myself in a chess match
in Washington Square Park

22:39.083 --> 22:41.083
with one of those hustlers

22:41.083 --> 22:44.166
who's been taking
tourists' money for years.

22:44.166 --> 22:45.958
A bit of a crowd
had formed.

22:45.958 --> 22:48.791
This was a hard-fought match.

22:50.416 --> 22:52.916
I had just gained an edge.

22:52.916 --> 22:57.625
I had an unstoppable waiting
attack when I saw it happen.

22:57.625 --> 23:01.000
He swiped both my knights
with one capture.

23:01.000 --> 23:04.166
Oh, the cheat was
very well executed.

23:04.166 --> 23:07.666
I was about to go across
the table at him.

23:07.666 --> 23:10.541
To make sure he was banned
from the park,

23:10.541 --> 23:12.875
to exact retribution.

23:12.875 --> 23:17.125
But then in an instant,
I saw...

23:17.125 --> 23:18.916
this was the chance

23:18.916 --> 23:23.083
to re-frame
my entire approach.

23:23.083 --> 23:25.541
So instead...

23:25.541 --> 23:28.541
♪ dramatic music playing  ♪

23:38.041 --> 23:40.250
I caught what you did.

23:40.250 --> 23:42.666
Takes practice to master
something like that.

23:42.666 --> 23:44.375
It's to be admired in a sense,

23:44.375 --> 23:47.208
but that is the last time
you use it today.

23:49.166 --> 23:52.416
I'm a man who could
make things difficult for you,

23:52.416 --> 23:54.833
but I won't.

23:54.833 --> 23:57.041
As long as
you'll understand this.

23:57.041 --> 24:00.625
Your next opponent
is that boy.

24:04.166 --> 24:07.833
And I want him to have a very
good time playing against you.

24:10.291 --> 24:11.708
Thank you.

24:11.708 --> 24:13.625
The man thanked me.

24:13.625 --> 24:16.916
Imagine that.

24:16.916 --> 24:20.166
And I knew he wasn't gonna
cheat anyone else that day

24:20.166 --> 24:23.166
and would look over his shoulder
thereafter.

24:23.166 --> 24:28.000
I had managed something
better than payback.

24:28.000 --> 24:30.458
By acting with purpose
and understatement,

24:30.458 --> 24:33.250
I had created
a more just environment,

24:33.250 --> 24:36.833
which is what I am asking
of all of you.

24:39.291 --> 24:41.000
This is the new way.

24:44.041 --> 24:47.125
Well, how do you know
if he did the right thing

24:47.125 --> 24:48.416
after you left?

24:48.416 --> 24:52.208
Uh, I sat on a nearby bench
and watched awhile.

25:10.916 --> 25:12.250
Thanks for coming.

25:12.250 --> 25:14.416
I know you'll think
it's worth the effort.

25:14.416 --> 25:16.875
-Quickly, Spyros.
-Okay.

25:16.875 --> 25:18.833
I always listen
to the ground.

25:18.833 --> 25:21.791
-It's how I got where I am.
-Mm-hmm. And?

25:21.791 --> 25:23.083
An investigation has begun

25:23.083 --> 25:26.000
into your office's
methods and conduct,

25:26.000 --> 25:29.458
focusing on an aborted
bribery case against Axelrod.

25:29.458 --> 25:31.583
And the man leading
the investigation

25:31.583 --> 25:35.125
is dangerous and capable.

25:35.125 --> 25:39.416
A younger, even smarter
version of me,

25:39.416 --> 25:42.125
if you can conjure that
for yourself.

25:42.125 --> 25:43.750
I scarcely can.

25:43.750 --> 25:46.000
Who is he?

25:46.000 --> 25:48.208
Oliver Dake.

25:53.958 --> 25:55.416
Are we square now?

25:57.125 --> 25:59.041
Don't serve rabbit food

Would you get these fine young
barristers another round?

26:19.625 --> 26:21.458
-Of course.
-Thank you.

26:21.458 --> 26:25.083
Before I go and have
a nightcap with Bart Schooner

26:25.083 --> 26:27.791
and get his thoughts on
who should replace him,

26:27.791 --> 26:30.166
let me speak to
what's hanging over the table

26:30.166 --> 26:32.083
and this entire room.

26:32.083 --> 26:35.125
The investigation that
Mr. Dake is conducting.

26:39.333 --> 26:43.333
You all know how to
handle yourselves.

26:43.333 --> 26:46.833
I want you all to cooperate,

26:46.833 --> 26:50.000
to be truthful,
of course.

26:52.750 --> 26:56.083
Because I don't believe
we have anything to worry about.

27:07.500 --> 27:09.166
See what he did?

27:09.166 --> 27:12.791
We handle ourselves and Chuck
gives someone Head of Crim.

27:12.791 --> 27:14.875
Or we cooperate with Dake
and try our luck

27:14.875 --> 27:16.791
starting over with
Chuck's replacement.

27:16.791 --> 27:19.625
Yeah, we saw what he did.

27:25.958 --> 27:27.833
And so
you haven't seen anything

27:27.833 --> 27:29.916
that makes you think
this office is acting

27:29.916 --> 27:32.625
-in an out-of-bounds manner?
-Ambiguous.

27:32.625 --> 27:35.333
Sharpen up the question
so I can give you a good answer.

27:35.333 --> 27:38.166
How would you describe
Mr. Rhoades' tactical approach?

27:38.166 --> 27:39.583
Effective.

27:39.583 --> 27:41.583
And his understanding of
the rules governing behavior?

27:41.583 --> 27:43.500
I can't speak to
his state of mind.

27:43.500 --> 27:47.291
Uh-huh. Let's, uh...

27:47.291 --> 27:50.750
Let's switch gears
for a moment.

27:50.750 --> 27:54.000
Tell me about your meeting
with Axelrod.

27:54.000 --> 27:56.333
The aborted settlement?

27:56.333 --> 27:58.791
No.
Your private meeting.

28:04.041 --> 28:06.375
You tell me how that is

28:06.375 --> 28:08.500
in any way relevant
to your investigation.

28:08.500 --> 28:11.458
I am investigating
all misconduct,

28:11.458 --> 28:13.416
wherever it may be.

28:13.416 --> 28:17.458
And however
an investigation may start,

28:17.458 --> 28:19.333
once I'm in it,

28:19.333 --> 28:22.958
I'm like
a Goddamned octopus --

28:22.958 --> 28:27.750
tentacles out in every
direction, looking, listening,

28:27.750 --> 28:32.625
sucking up every bit of
information that I can find.

28:35.166 --> 28:38.250
Look,
I reported that meeting

28:38.250 --> 28:40.041
the second it was over,

28:40.041 --> 28:42.083
and I have the documentation
to prove it.

28:42.083 --> 28:43.625
Ahhh.

28:43.625 --> 28:46.125
You reported it the next day

28:46.125 --> 28:47.750
in the afternoon.

28:47.750 --> 28:49.000
First chance I got.

28:49.000 --> 28:50.958
Or maybe it took you
that long to decide

28:50.958 --> 28:52.916
what to leave in
and what to leave out.

28:54.375 --> 28:56.208
I left it all in.

28:56.208 --> 28:58.458
Axelrod offered me a job.

28:58.458 --> 29:01.125
This is at the pizzeria
in Yonkers, yes?

29:01.125 --> 29:02.500
That's right.

29:02.500 --> 29:03.750
I turned it down.

29:03.750 --> 29:05.041
Did you?

29:05.041 --> 29:07.000
With no provers in the room,

29:07.000 --> 29:08.250
it's only your word and his.

29:08.250 --> 29:10.833
If I asked Axelrod,
is that how he'd remember it?

You gonna
invite me to sit down?

30:05.541 --> 30:07.500
No.

30:17.708 --> 30:19.708
If you knew enough
to make an appointment

30:19.708 --> 30:21.083
under an assumed name,
you knew

30:21.083 --> 30:23.541
-I didn't want to see you.
-I knew you wouldn't,

30:23.541 --> 30:25.625
but that's not the same
as not wanting to.

30:25.625 --> 30:27.833
Yes, it is.

30:32.375 --> 30:35.750
There's this thing that happens
when we're in a room together.

30:37.208 --> 30:41.125
It always has, Bobby.
It just flows like this.

30:41.125 --> 30:44.166
But I'm shutting it off.

30:44.166 --> 30:46.250
I have shut it off.

30:46.250 --> 30:49.250
Okay.

30:49.250 --> 30:51.625
First, I apologized.

30:51.625 --> 30:54.125
But if it takes me sending you
flowers every day,

30:54.125 --> 30:56.875
Joe DiMaggio style,
to prove it, I will.

30:56.875 --> 30:59.041
He did that
after Marilyn was dead.

30:59.041 --> 31:02.083
Yours would have the same effect
on me that his had on her.

31:02.083 --> 31:04.333
But I need you back
at Axe Capital.

31:04.333 --> 31:06.583
Well,
that's not gonna happen.

31:08.541 --> 31:11.208
Look, there are decisions
I have to make

31:11.208 --> 31:13.458
over actions that I might take,

31:13.458 --> 31:15.625
and I have never had to do it
without you.

31:15.625 --> 31:19.125
The time to recognize that
has long since passed.

31:19.125 --> 31:21.125
We are at
an inflection point.

31:21.125 --> 31:23.000

to the company.

31:23.000 --> 31:24.500
We have to make it quickly.

31:24.500 --> 31:29.208
And I am getting conflicting
advice from my people.

31:29.208 --> 31:31.500
The kind of things that

31:31.500 --> 31:34.208
I bounce off you
and it all makes sense.

31:34.208 --> 31:38.250
I know you well enough
to tell you one thing.

31:38.250 --> 31:40.166
You'll figure it out.

31:40.166 --> 31:42.708
You'll connect the dots,
synthesize the information

31:42.708 --> 31:44.541
in a way few others
in this world can.

31:44.541 --> 31:47.041
You always do. It'll be
an amazing thing to see.

31:47.041 --> 31:50.500
But I won't
be there to see it.

31:50.500 --> 31:51.958
What, then?

31:51.958 --> 31:53.250
This?

31:55.708 --> 32:00.583
Just sit here in a nice,
small, well-appointed office,

32:00.583 --> 32:02.791
listen to bullshit
all day long

32:02.791 --> 32:04.750
from people who are
half as smart as us?

32:04.750 --> 32:07.458
I don't know. I was thinking
maybe another hedge fund.

32:07.458 --> 32:08.958
Oh, is that right?

32:08.958 --> 32:10.958
Yeah, I was at another one
the other day.

32:10.958 --> 32:12.708
I won't tell you which,
so don't ask.

32:12.708 --> 32:15.750
And the manager played
some heavy game theory on me,

32:15.750 --> 32:18.375
boxed me into a spot,
essentially put himself

32:18.375 --> 32:20.500
in a position to win
no matter what I said.

32:20.500 --> 32:23.083
I know who it is. I can tell
already by what you said.

32:23.083 --> 32:26.125
Well, I'm tired of being on the
losing side of that paradigm.

32:26.125 --> 32:28.125
-He was looking to hire you?
-Yeah.

-Next.

33:09.041 --> 33:11.500
We should go to cash,
take some time off, and --

33:11.500 --> 33:14.208
Okay, fuck this. Do any of you
have juice with Raya?

33:14.208 --> 33:15.458
I could
build a model for it.

33:15.458 --> 33:18.041
I don't want to invest in it.
I want to get on it.

33:18.041 --> 33:19.750
-What is that?
-High-end hookup app.

33:19.750 --> 33:23.083
-Tinder for the rich and famous.
-That's so reductive.

33:23.083 --> 33:25.916
It's exclusive,
and it's about connection.

33:25.916 --> 33:27.500
I was saying
with cash on hand --

33:27.500 --> 33:29.083
Stop talking.

33:29.083 --> 33:31.666
I'm not gonna take any of this
dog shit back to Axe.

33:31.666 --> 33:33.250
It's time for you folks to
sharpen your pencils,

33:33.250 --> 33:36.250
and you better come back
with one Traci Lords of an idea.

33:36.250 --> 33:38.458
And if you need that fucking
defined, here it is.

33:38.458 --> 33:40.250
A barely legal,
market-dominating,

33:40.250 --> 33:44.208
brilliant cocksucker
of an idea.

33:51.291 --> 33:53.458
Thanks for working
through lunch.

33:53.458 --> 33:56.583
I've got to dump five million
shares of Bluudhorn Steel at 40.

33:56.583 --> 33:58.500
Problem is,
the trade's by appointment.

33:58.500 --> 34:00.291
No broker will take
all five million

34:00.291 --> 34:02.166
and guarantee my price,

34:02.166 --> 34:05.041
so I've got five brokers
selling a million each,

34:05.041 --> 34:06.791
and they don't
know about each other.

34:06.791 --> 34:09.083
Are you sure about
the way you're unloading that?

34:09.083 --> 34:11.166
It's kind of shady
and not very efficient.

34:11.166 --> 34:13.000
They'll find out
and ding you later.

34:13.000 --> 34:14.791
I've got to get the price.

34:14.791 --> 34:17.000
You heard what Axe said.
Survive or die.

34:17.000 --> 34:20.208
What if you create
a zero-cost collar?

34:20.208 --> 34:22.416
Right...

34:22.416 --> 34:24.958
Use options
to protect the sale.

34:24.958 --> 34:27.083
Buy $40 puts in Bluudhorn,

34:27.083 --> 34:29.750
then sell $45 calls
to offset the purchase.

34:29.750 --> 34:31.375
You've got free protection
at $40.

34:31.375 --> 34:33.208
The maximum downside
is protected.

34:33.208 --> 34:34.458
But now you can be patient,

34:34.458 --> 34:36.416
and you don't have to
lean on the stock.

34:36.416 --> 34:38.208
You're right.

34:38.208 --> 34:41.000
That'll save us ten million
on this trade.

34:41.000 --> 34:43.666
This is why I need to keep you
when your internship's over.

34:43.666 --> 34:46.250
Yes. I'd believe the same thing
were I you.

34:46.250 --> 34:49.083
Oh.
I ordered you lunch.

34:49.083 --> 34:50.208
Vegan.

34:50.208 --> 34:52.250
What makes you think
I'm a vegan?

34:52.250 --> 34:54.666
I don't know.

34:54.666 --> 34:56.125
Everything?

34:56.125 --> 34:59.125
All of it?

34:59.125 --> 35:01.333
Fuck.

35:01.333 --> 35:03.250
You're not?

35:03.250 --> 35:04.750
I'll eat it.

35:04.750 --> 35:08.958
Look, I've eliminated slippage
since you've got here.

35:08.958 --> 35:11.125
My trade-cost analysis
is up 150 bips.

35:11.125 --> 35:14.791
And that's before the 10-ball
you just saved me.

35:14.791 --> 35:17.000
It's not a fluke.
It's efficiency.

35:17.000 --> 35:18.750
It's you.

35:18.750 --> 35:20.250
And now you're leaving.

35:20.250 --> 35:22.333
I can't afford that.

35:22.333 --> 35:24.500
I'll die off.

35:24.500 --> 35:28.458
And that's before I blew lunch
with you not being a vegan.

35:28.458 --> 35:31.208
Of course I'm a vegan.

35:33.583 --> 35:35.208
Here's my problem.

35:35.208 --> 35:38.041
The shit that I do to keep most
people after an internship --

35:38.041 --> 35:40.625
throwing money around,
showing them a good time --

35:40.625 --> 35:42.125
none of that's
gonna work on you.

35:42.125 --> 35:44.458
You mean like hot girls
showing up at my place

35:44.458 --> 35:46.083
and drink till I puke
and all that?

35:46.083 --> 35:48.791
I agree.
That wouldn't work in this case.

35:48.791 --> 35:50.583
So how do I keep you?

35:50.583 --> 35:52.375
You kind of can't.

35:55.083 --> 35:58.041
♪ rock music plays  ♪

36:59.416 --> 37:01.333
Yeah, of course, man.

37:01.333 --> 37:03.708
You guys know each other, right?
Same precinct?

37:03.708 --> 37:05.125
Different years. Detective.

37:05.125 --> 37:06.750
Long before
you became a banker

37:06.750 --> 37:08.500
or a trustee or whatever,
Raul.

37:08.500 --> 37:10.625
- Still more police than banker.

37:10.625 --> 37:12.000
-Good to see you.
-Yeah.

37:12.000 --> 37:15.125
I had good come-back about you
from the school.

37:15.125 --> 37:18.291
- Oh, how fucking lovely.

37:18.291 --> 37:21.000
Be an easy road to make you
the full-time nurse.

37:21.000 --> 37:22.791
-Yeah?
-Yep.

37:22.791 --> 37:24.875
- What are we talking about?

37:24.875 --> 37:29.208
Well, they'd start you at 72k,
something for housing.

37:29.208 --> 37:32.208
And I'll get them up
from there.

37:32.208 --> 37:33.500
Come on, Mo.

37:33.500 --> 37:35.625
It'd be so nice to
have you around, man.

37:35.625 --> 37:37.333
Instead of rolling with
these stiffs

37:37.333 --> 37:39.208
that I've got up here
all the time.

37:39.208 --> 37:40.875
Oh, no,

37:40.875 --> 37:43.125
it's not much more than
what I'm taking down now,

37:43.125 --> 37:45.250
and it's still
just pulling shifts.

37:45.250 --> 37:48.041
If I'm making a change,
it's got to be bigger.

37:48.041 --> 37:50.666
You know, I need to step up

37:50.666 --> 37:52.458
and score my next chapter,
you know?

37:52.458 --> 37:54.333
Yeah.

37:54.333 --> 37:56.708
I know.

37:56.708 --> 37:59.166
Certain douchebag motorcycle
club was dealing out of

37:59.166 --> 38:02.166
the men's room at the Hendricks.
And these guys were good.

38:02.166 --> 38:04.500
Our undercovers couldn't make
one buy off of them.

38:04.500 --> 38:07.500
So we started sending in teams
to surveil through the ceiling

38:07.500 --> 38:09.708
of the men's room.
And one day I'm up there.

38:09.708 --> 38:11.583
I'm watching.
And I see a deal go down.

38:11.583 --> 38:13.458
I must have been
leaning over too much,

38:13.458 --> 38:15.666
'cause I fell right through
the drop ceiling

38:15.666 --> 38:17.625
and landed right on my ass
in the middle

38:17.625 --> 38:19.041
- of the men's room.

38:19.041 --> 38:21.125
A black man
in an N.Y.P.D. uniform.

38:21.125 --> 38:22.541
I'm like -- I look up,

38:22.541 --> 38:25.291
and it's a half a dozen
Hells Angels staring down at me.

38:25.291 --> 38:28.208
So...

38:28.208 --> 38:32.583
They lit in on me with
fists, bottles, boots.

38:32.583 --> 38:35.000
They damn near beat the cop
right out of me.

38:35.000 --> 38:37.000
Barely got
out of there alive.

38:37.000 --> 38:38.833
They say it never happened.

38:38.833 --> 38:40.083
Of course not.

38:40.083 --> 38:43.375
But the way it still gets told,
that night end of shift,

38:43.375 --> 38:45.500
every swinging dick
at the station

38:45.500 --> 38:47.458
went back to that bar
with nightsticks,

38:47.458 --> 38:50.291
reduced those fucking bikers
to smudge marks on the floor.

38:50.291 --> 38:54.166
No dealing went on in that bar
for a long, long time.

38:55.625 --> 38:59.041
See, back then, it came down
to factions, superior numbers.

38:59.041 --> 39:00.958
When they had them
and I was alone,

39:00.958 --> 39:03.166
they won.

39:03.166 --> 39:05.291
But when we had them,

39:05.291 --> 39:08.041
well, it's hard to defend
against numbers.

39:08.041 --> 39:10.000
That's a lesson
you only have to learn once.

39:12.291 --> 39:14.500
Absolutely.

39:21.458 --> 39:25.208
I need to deploy your
specialized computing skills,

39:25.208 --> 39:29.416
can-do attitude, the magic
of your tech nerdistry.

39:29.416 --> 39:32.541
No one's ever said I have
a can-do attitude before.

39:32.541 --> 39:35.291
That's because you hide it
behind a superior, dismissive,

39:35.291 --> 39:39.208
and pessimistic mask,
but I see past all that.

39:39.208 --> 39:42.083
Uh, what do you need?

39:42.083 --> 39:43.500
Raya.

39:43.500 --> 39:46.916
I need you to hack into Raya
and get me an account on there.

39:46.916 --> 39:48.625
I can't do -- do that.

39:50.583 --> 39:52.708
-Of course you can.
-I mean, maybe I could,

39:52.708 --> 39:55.458
but that site's encrypted with
a 128-bit Blowfish cipher.

39:55.458 --> 39:57.041
And no brute-force attack
has been

39:57.041 --> 39:59.000
extensive enough to crack it.
There's --

39:59.000 --> 40:01.958
There's no way I can make
a reasonable attempt and still

40:01.958 --> 40:03.750
-complete my other tasks.
-Like what?

40:03.750 --> 40:06.083
Making sure this place
is secure from cyberattack.

40:06.083 --> 40:08.625
-You've already done that.
-But I have to oversee

40:08.625 --> 40:11.041
all our trading software,
all our servers, my team.

40:11.041 --> 40:12.750
And you will.

40:12.750 --> 40:15.916
As soon as
you get me onto Raya.

40:18.208 --> 40:20.791
Yes.

40:30.041 --> 40:31.083
Judge DeGiulio!

40:31.083 --> 40:33.750
Mr. Rhoades, sir.
At your service, sir.

40:33.750 --> 40:37.000
Good.
Let me tell you what I need.

40:37.000 --> 40:38.875
I'm not really
at your service.

40:38.875 --> 40:40.583
Chuck,
I was quoting "Hamilton."

40:40.583 --> 40:43.208
Ah.
I haven't been able to see it.

40:43.208 --> 40:44.708
What do you need?

40:44.708 --> 40:47.500
There's an investigator named
Dake up here from D.C.

40:47.500 --> 40:50.791
Ooh. That's a hard man.
Good one.

40:50.791 --> 40:53.041
Yeah, terrific.
Yes, I can see that he's good.

40:53.041 --> 40:55.458
I'd like him to be
good and gone.

40:55.458 --> 40:57.333
Now,
I need to know who sent him

40:57.333 --> 40:59.125
and what they hope
to accomplish.

41:01.125 --> 41:04.833
Are you familiar with the origin
of the word "billet"?

41:04.833 --> 41:06.375
Is this another
"Hamilton" thing?

41:06.375 --> 41:08.458
-No.
-Well, then, yes.

41:08.458 --> 41:10.125
It came from the French

41:10.125 --> 41:12.916
to mean an order to allow
a soldier to live in your home.

41:12.916 --> 41:17.041
But what it's come to mean
is a post or position

41:17.041 --> 41:19.333
and responsibilities
that go along with it.

41:19.333 --> 41:22.541
So my billet
is to be a judge

41:22.541 --> 41:24.208
and adjudicate
on various matters

41:24.208 --> 41:26.458
as put forth
and et cetera.

41:26.458 --> 41:28.083
It is not,
and will never be,

41:28.083 --> 41:30.916
to do your bidding.

41:30.916 --> 41:33.166
I forgot to say please,
didn't I?

41:33.166 --> 41:36.083
I'm working on that.

41:36.083 --> 41:37.500
Please?

41:37.500 --> 41:39.250
Always a lovely word
to hear,

41:39.250 --> 41:41.250
but I'm not
some deputy anymore.

41:41.250 --> 41:42.750
Oh, no.

41:42.750 --> 41:46.083
Uh, I get that
and respect it.

41:46.083 --> 41:49.541
But we both know why
you're not a deputy anymore,

41:49.541 --> 41:52.166
so I am asking you
to do this one for me.

41:52.166 --> 41:55.041
As a final courtesy.

41:59.291 --> 42:02.250
Sure, sir.

42:02.250 --> 42:04.625
Come by my chambers
Friday morning.

42:04.625 --> 42:06.208
I should have information
by then.

42:06.208 --> 42:07.583
And thank y--

42:07.583 --> 42:09.208
You're welcome, Chaz.

42:18.458 --> 42:20.416
Give me your phone.

42:22.208 --> 42:25.041
We need our I.T. staff back
and your focus.

42:25.041 --> 42:27.875
I can't have you phishing
the Internet pointlessly.

42:27.875 --> 42:29.708
I'm logging you on to Raya.

42:29.708 --> 42:32.208
-How?
-I'm a member, so I vouch.

42:32.208 --> 42:34.708
You need two reccos.
I got Michael Che to second you.

42:34.708 --> 42:37.416
Can't have you distracting
our staff with this bullshit.

42:37.416 --> 42:39.458
-You're a member?
-So are you now.

42:39.458 --> 42:42.041
All I ask is
Chatham House Rule on it.

42:42.041 --> 42:45.375
And when you see me on there,
don't fucking tap the heart.

♪ suspenseful music plays  ♪

43:19.458 --> 43:22.125
Mr. Rhoades.

43:22.125 --> 43:27.041
So, I'm going through
my initial round of interviews

43:27.041 --> 43:30.500
and all seems,
uh, if not kosher,

43:30.500 --> 43:33.041
then at least within
a reasonable bandwidth.

43:33.041 --> 43:36.666
And I'm thinking, you know,
I'm just about out of here.

43:36.666 --> 43:37.666
Uh-huh.

43:37.666 --> 43:40.208
But...

43:40.208 --> 43:43.166
Then I

43:43.166 --> 43:46.333
become aware
of a payment.

43:48.708 --> 43:49.916
A payment?

43:49.916 --> 43:52.500
That your wife received.

43:52.500 --> 43:54.791
From Axelrod.

43:54.791 --> 43:57.750
An account of hers
that you're a signer on.

43:57.750 --> 43:59.916
Right around, uh,

43:59.916 --> 44:02.666
well, hell, right on

44:02.666 --> 44:06.250
the day that you suspended
your investigation into him.

44:06.250 --> 44:09.666
$5 million.

44:09.666 --> 44:12.583
Now,

44:12.583 --> 44:15.208
it may not be a bribe,

44:15.208 --> 44:18.541
but, dang,
if it doesn't look like one

44:18.541 --> 44:20.291
and smell like one.

44:20.291 --> 44:22.916
And if I
put my tongue on it,

44:22.916 --> 44:25.916
I bet it tastes like one,
too.

44:25.916 --> 44:29.916
Yum-bang.

44:29.916 --> 44:32.583
Now, I suppose

44:32.583 --> 44:35.083
you didn't know
anything about that?

44:48.666 --> 44:53.083
♪ suspenseful music plays  ♪

44:59.291 --> 45:01.500
If we're doing this,
we're supposed to knock,

45:01.500 --> 45:03.250
-not just let ourselves in.
-Uh-huh.

45:03.250 --> 45:05.833
I was gonna let the sitter
get them ready for you.

45:05.833 --> 45:07.416
She still can.

45:07.416 --> 45:09.541
We need to talk.

45:09.541 --> 45:11.625
That's not really
the idea of this.

45:11.625 --> 45:13.166
We have to
give each other room.

45:13.166 --> 45:14.541
Yeah, I know.
I'm aware.

45:14.541 --> 45:16.875
Not a social call.

45:22.083 --> 45:24.125
What, then?

45:27.083 --> 45:32.208
I understand that we are in
a temporary moment of separation

45:32.208 --> 45:36.291
and no longer in the mode
of telling each other

45:36.291 --> 45:38.166
our day's events
in detail.

45:38.166 --> 45:40.125
If we'd been communicating
that well before,

45:40.125 --> 45:43.125
we might still be together.

45:43.125 --> 45:46.083
Are we putting that
on me?

45:46.083 --> 45:48.458
Half of it at least.

45:50.916 --> 45:52.750
But there were some things
that really

45:52.750 --> 45:55.208
ought to have been discussed,

45:55.208 --> 45:58.208
some things that I cannot
imagine keeping to myself.

45:58.208 --> 46:01.250
For instance,
if I had suddenly received

46:01.250 --> 46:04.000
a $5 million
lump-sum payment

46:04.000 --> 46:06.666
the same day that my husband
dropped an investigation

46:06.666 --> 46:08.791
on the man making that payment,

46:08.791 --> 46:12.083
I might have fucking managed
to say something about it.

46:19.666 --> 46:23.041
I didn't see how that...

46:23.041 --> 46:26.208
sequence of events
might appear.

46:26.208 --> 46:28.083
Is that an apology?

46:31.000 --> 46:33.916
I didn't mean to put
your reputation in question.

46:33.916 --> 46:35.666
Not just my reputation.

46:35.666 --> 46:38.833
My job.

46:38.833 --> 46:40.291
Perhaps my freedom.

46:40.291 --> 46:41.916
Perhaps yours.

46:41.916 --> 46:44.125
Freedom? Pfft.

46:44.125 --> 46:46.666
I am just beginning to remember
what that feels like.

46:46.666 --> 46:48.041
And I'm not gonna
let you ruin

46:48.041 --> 46:50.416
one of the first free nights
I've had in years.

46:50.416 --> 46:54.041
I always knew I'd end up snared
by Axelrod's money. It's poison.

46:54.041 --> 46:57.000
And you don't even need to
ingest it for it to kill you.

46:57.000 --> 46:59.500
-Proximity is enough.
-Well, good for you.

46:59.500 --> 47:01.333
I no longer
have proximity to it,

47:01.333 --> 47:04.041
and you no longer
have proximity to me.

47:04.041 --> 47:07.916
Have fun with the children.

47:07.916 --> 47:09.916
Hey, kids, I'm leaving!

47:09.916 --> 47:11.625
Your daddy's here!

47:11.625 --> 47:13.375
I love you!

47:19.208 --> 47:22.083
Hey, guys! Here I come!

47:28.166 --> 47:30.416
This place gave me
my first real look

47:30.416 --> 47:32.041
at how the world worked.

47:32.041 --> 47:34.875
I watched people running toward
the betting window

47:34.875 --> 47:38.208
with high hopes.

47:38.208 --> 47:40.166
No plan.

47:40.166 --> 47:42.416
Then I'd watch them
walk away from the track

47:42.416 --> 47:46.166
ripping up their tickets
in disgust.

47:46.166 --> 47:48.083
That wasn't gonna be me.

47:48.083 --> 47:49.541
You didn't bet?

47:49.541 --> 47:51.375
Oh, I bet.

47:51.375 --> 47:53.500
I bet,
but first I figured out

47:53.500 --> 47:56.125
where the sharp action was,

47:56.125 --> 47:59.500
where the guys who
had a plan were,

47:59.500 --> 48:01.291
guys who grinded,

48:01.291 --> 48:03.208
take the guesswork
out of it.

48:03.208 --> 48:05.041
They knew which drivers
had been rested.

48:05.041 --> 48:07.041
They knew
which horses were ready.

48:07.041 --> 48:10.333
And they also knew which ones
were on last legs.

48:10.333 --> 48:13.083
How'd you meet those guys?

48:13.083 --> 48:15.166
I didn't at first.

48:15.166 --> 48:17.000
But I figured out

48:17.000 --> 48:21.083
that they always bet late
and they bet heavy.

48:24.125 --> 48:27.000
So I started watching that

48:27.000 --> 48:30.125
instead of that.

48:30.125 --> 48:33.708
The numbers told the story.
They always do.

48:33.708 --> 48:36.208
I started making bets
of my own.

48:36.208 --> 48:38.333
You know,
the right ones.

48:38.333 --> 48:40.666
And once I understood
what had happened,

48:40.666 --> 48:44.041
I watched the track
to see how it happened.

48:47.083 --> 48:49.125
Strange time
for a workout.

48:49.125 --> 48:51.750
Yeah, he comes here
most days of the week.

48:51.750 --> 48:54.208
Likes to run his new prospects
out under the lights,

48:54.208 --> 48:57.708
get them used to it.

49:00.791 --> 49:03.750
He's a good driver.

49:03.750 --> 49:05.458

49:05.458 --> 49:07.541

Hall of Fame.

49:10.083 --> 49:11.750
Always finished top three.

Oh, but to you,
top three is never enough.

49:15.750 --> 49:18.000
You don't show. You win.

49:18.000 --> 49:19.541

49:19.541 --> 49:21.416
Mine's a different business.

49:24.208 --> 49:26.791
Look,
you and the team are right.

49:26.791 --> 49:29.125
There's too much risk.

49:29.125 --> 49:33.208
I could open myself up
to a big loss

49:33.208 --> 49:36.208
if I made a move and miss.

49:38.333 --> 49:40.083
When I used to come down here,

49:40.083 --> 49:43.041
I had nothing,
so I-I just figured it out.

49:43.041 --> 49:45.333
That you did.

49:47.333 --> 49:49.458
I need Rhoades gone.

49:49.458 --> 49:52.500
Or this will never be over.

49:52.500 --> 49:55.541
My suit alone,

49:55.541 --> 49:59.208
it's like me firing a pea
shooter against a Panzer tank

49:59.208 --> 50:02.625
when what we need
is a Howitzer.

50:02.625 --> 50:05.250
But I know how we can
get ourselves a Howie.

50:08.208 --> 50:11.125
We find everybody
that he fucked,

50:11.125 --> 50:13.958
who went away aggrieved,

50:13.958 --> 50:17.375
people with real grounds,

50:17.375 --> 50:19.208

50:19.208 --> 50:21.875
Ah.

Aggregate the lawsuits.

50:24.291 --> 50:26.125
Where one is weak,
many are strong.

50:26.125 --> 50:29.208
And that's a lesson you'll never
have to learn more than once.

50:29.208 --> 50:32.041
It'll be tantamount
to a class-action suit.

50:32.041 --> 50:34.000

50:34.000 --> 50:36.000
Not possible to.

50:36.000 --> 50:39.041

anymore. They'll be about him.

No.

He doesn't.

51:05.750 --> 51:09.000

Didn't make any sense

this one.
Bobby Axelrod.

52:45.125 --> 52:47.583

are similar,

52:47.583 --> 52:50.208

52:50.208 --> 52:53.500

all of them,

this Dake investigation,

53:02.166 --> 53:04.000
and Dake has
told the A.G. about

53:04.000 --> 53:07.166
some kind of balloon payment
that has a certain stink to it.
