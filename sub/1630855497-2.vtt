WEBVTT

00:04.749 --> 00:07.460
So, now we call the police, right?

00:07.460 --> 00:09.505
Can we make sure Jared's safe first?

00:09.505 --> 00:13.092
I mean, if somebody was targeting him,
they may still be looking for him

00:13.092 --> 00:14.759
once they figure out it's not him.

00:14.759 --> 00:17.805
Well, if they figure out it's not Jared,
what are they going to do to that boy?

00:18.429 --> 00:21.349
- Do we know his name?
- Derek said his name was Nicky.

00:21.349 --> 00:24.103
Can we bring this back to our son?
What are we doing?

00:24.103 --> 00:28.023
Are we putting him in a hotel?
Are we going with him to a hotel?

00:28.023 --> 00:32.653
- Joey! You've got a place, right?
- Yeah, my family's got a hunting camp.

00:32.653 --> 00:34.488
- Where?
- Oh, middle of nowhere.

00:34.488 --> 00:36.322
No reception. Don't even have Wi-Fi.

00:36.322 --> 00:37.782
- Oh, I like that.
- Perfect.

00:37.782 --> 00:38.951
But also...

00:38.951 --> 00:41.953
Oh, yeah, we'll go down to the diner
every morning and evening.

00:41.953 --> 00:44.164
- Right, just so we can call.
- Right.

00:44.164 --> 00:45.291
So, the police...

00:46.374 --> 00:49.128
It... Now, a definite no, then.

00:49.670 --> 00:53.006
You know, we've got options
besides the feds.

00:53.966 --> 00:55.466
Could consult your brother.

00:55.466 --> 00:56.551
- What?
- We're not...

00:56.551 --> 00:58.302
- We're not bringing him into this. No.
- No.

00:58.302 --> 00:59.555
- No.
- Also, I don't see

00:59.555 --> 01:01.932
how the police thing works.
We need to go now.

01:01.932 --> 01:04.518
We're supposed to be at a parking lot
at midnight with the money.

01:04.518 --> 01:07.186
Well, do we know
what this 1:11 thing is about? I...

01:07.186 --> 01:11.941
- What is this 300 whatever thousand?
- Guys, we don't have time for any of this.

01:11.941 --> 01:14.737
- Who is Charisse?
- What?

01:15.112 --> 01:17.655
Charisse. When Dad asked
for more information,

01:17.655 --> 01:18.824
he said, "Charisse."

01:18.824 --> 01:20.950
I don't know. A place maybe.

01:20.950 --> 01:25.247
- Charisse is a place?
- Yeah. No, maybe not. No idea.

01:25.247 --> 01:27.082
Okay, so, Jeff and I are gonna go now.

01:27.082 --> 01:29.043
We're gonna continue
to follow their instructions,

01:29.043 --> 01:30.418
and we're gonna get this kid back.

01:30.418 --> 01:32.045
Wait. Derek, have we decided this?

01:32.045 --> 01:33.964
I mean,
I want to do the right thing, but--

01:33.964 --> 01:36.299
Sam, this is the right decision.
That kid is out there.

01:36.299 --> 01:38.468
Seriously, is this really a question?

01:38.468 --> 01:40.512
Yeah. No. Yeah, you're right.

01:41.388 --> 01:43.641
Okay. Okay, I'm gonna
let Jared know the plan.

01:43.641 --> 01:44.808
Hey.

01:45.975 --> 01:47.393
Right. Oh my God.

01:49.312 --> 01:50.939
Are we leaving or what?

01:52.483 --> 01:55.360
- Be safe, please.
- I will. We will.

02:03.785 --> 02:06.288
- It's pi, by the way.
- What?

02:06.288 --> 02:08.164
3.14159...

02:10.459 --> 02:12.251
is pi, you know? A circle.

02:16.215 --> 02:19.759
- What is the emergency?
- Ms. M...

02:20.468 --> 02:23.012
we... we found something
in the place with them...

02:23.012 --> 02:25.723
with them boys.
They... In one of them beds.

02:25.723 --> 02:29.353
Law enforcement business card.
One of the boys is in the van right now.

02:29.353 --> 02:31.354
Well, do take appropriate measures.

02:32.563 --> 02:36.360
Okay. So, I... I'll call Paul
and tell him to abort the mission now.

02:36.360 --> 02:39.529
No, Mr. Willoughby has completed
the chalk circle.

02:39.529 --> 02:40.990
We're already in progress.

02:40.990 --> 02:44.283
No, I mean to shore up
whatever leak there may be

02:44.283 --> 02:45.827
and continue as planned.

02:47.246 --> 02:48.247
Okay.

02:51.916 --> 02:52.917
Before I do that,

02:54.002 --> 02:56.630
there's a frustration
in the crew. Myself included.

02:56.630 --> 02:59.966
Different, different people know
different parts of the picture, but...

02:59.966 --> 03:02.386
- Nobody knows the big picture?
- Yes, yes.

03:03.887 --> 03:05.681
Garmen, you don't trust me?

03:05.681 --> 03:09.809
After all the businesses we built?
And the successes we've had?

03:10.393 --> 03:13.062
No, I'm gonna tell you, tonight is...

03:13.062 --> 03:15.399
is uncharted territory, to say the least.

03:15.399 --> 03:17.525
We'll get there shortly, Garmen.

03:17.984 --> 03:21.739
And people like Mr. Edward Chung
will no longer be able to get to us.

03:21.739 --> 03:23.699
That's the big picture.

03:23.699 --> 03:26.952
So, you do exactly
what I'm paying you to do

03:26.952 --> 03:29.287
and exactly how
I've instructed you to do it.

03:29.955 --> 03:31.582
And clean up the mess in the van.

03:33.375 --> 03:34.460
And, Aked...

03:35.961 --> 03:39.255
Look after Aked because sometimes
he's his own worst enemy, you know?

03:39.255 --> 03:40.298
Yeah, I know.

03:41.008 --> 03:43.093
All right, I'll see you
at the party after.

03:44.553 --> 03:47.264
Oh God, look at the time, is it...

03:51.642 --> 03:54.645
Right. Yeah. I'm on it.

03:58.649 --> 04:01.778
Almost there, Ranwell. Almost there.

04:04.906 --> 04:07.992
Victor, Garmen Harry here. You in town?

04:09.286 --> 04:13.040
I... I need you for a job.
Tonight. Like... Like now.

04:13.040 --> 04:14.625
Where you there? Come pick you up.

04:20.963 --> 04:23.133
Give him another one
of those sleeping pills.

04:23.133 --> 04:24.258
Yeah.

04:24.258 --> 04:26.886
- You'll be fine, right, Jared?
- Open your mouth.

04:26.886 --> 04:28.472
Open your fucking mouth!

04:31.266 --> 04:33.976
Hey... what's that?

04:36.187 --> 04:37.814
Louis, what's that? That's your phone?

04:39.065 --> 04:40.108
Give it to me.

04:41.275 --> 04:45.113
Give it to me now. Come on. Thank you.

04:46.030 --> 04:47.407
No, I just bought it!

04:47.407 --> 04:50.494
Fuck! Your fucking
personal cell phone, huh?

04:52.663 --> 04:53.913
Fucking stupid.

04:59.420 --> 05:00.712
My stomach acid right now.

05:13.808 --> 05:16.477
- This mother's gone raas.
- Fuck.

05:24.277 --> 05:26.030
Xav, I need you to text Nat.

05:27.114 --> 05:28.490
Tell her my phone broke.

05:40.251 --> 05:42.462
Hey, one of the acupuncture
training dummies is missing

05:42.462 --> 05:43.922
from the room. You seen it?

05:46.467 --> 05:47.633
No... No idea.

05:53.265 --> 05:56.476
<i>It makes no sense
that I would be targeted.</i>

05:56.476 --> 05:58.520
I employ thousands.

05:59.354 --> 06:01.148
There's the show when we had it.

06:01.148 --> 06:05.319
The office. The...
The place where we jarred things.

06:05.319 --> 06:08.154
The... The...
Not to mention the service kitchens.

06:08.738 --> 06:12.200
- Now, that's 11 cities, 11.
- Jeff.

06:12.200 --> 06:15.162
And I visit my fans in the hospital,

06:15.162 --> 06:19.917
and I go to their fucking
whatever rest homes or whatever.

06:21.794 --> 06:23.795
I was just playing chess
with one of them tonight.

06:23.795 --> 06:27.048
We get it. You do things
for strangers. Congratulations.

06:27.048 --> 06:29.051
But someone just has to think
you're an asshole.

06:29.051 --> 06:30.426
You don't have to be one.

07:18.767 --> 07:21.644
Good evening, Mr. Harry.
How can I help you?

07:21.644 --> 07:24.522
I need you to take a ride
with Paul and me.

07:24.522 --> 07:25.690
Sounds good.

07:49.881 --> 07:52.051
All right, now's the part where we wait.

07:52.051 --> 07:53.218
Why?

07:54.678 --> 07:57.096
Why? Well, because one,

07:57.681 --> 07:59.849
the Browne family
still gotta gather the money.

07:59.849 --> 08:03.604
And two, boss wants us to sit here
and wait for instructions, all right?

08:04.270 --> 08:06.982
Wait. So we're not going
to Washington Square Park, then?

08:06.982 --> 08:09.484
Why the fuck would we go
to Washington Square Park?

08:10.735 --> 08:13.489
Crowded downtown park, that's stupid.
Why would you ask me that?

08:13.489 --> 08:15.783
Well, Garmen asked me to go
to Washington Square Park

08:15.783 --> 08:16.991
and mark some circle.

08:17.825 --> 08:19.452
So I guess it was for that.

08:20.079 --> 08:21.871
Ga... Garmen asked you?

08:23.666 --> 08:24.583
Why?

08:26.042 --> 08:27.085
Don't know.

08:28.045 --> 08:30.714
He said Ms. Mahabir want it, so...

08:30.714 --> 08:33.549
- And you didn't want to tell me?
- Well, I didn't think I had to.

08:36.928 --> 08:38.847
Okay, so, let me get this straight.

08:41.432 --> 08:45.104
I finally turn a guy,
which takes weeks, as you know,

08:45.104 --> 08:48.981
and the only thing you can think
to say to me is that it might be bullshit?

08:48.981 --> 08:50.985
I didn't say it was bullshit.

08:50.985 --> 08:54.404
- But he did bail on you, so...
- Yeah, and that's why I don't believe him.

08:54.404 --> 08:57.366
So you're chasing him to impress a boss

08:57.366 --> 08:59.993
who doesn't respect you enough
to even call you back.

09:01.120 --> 09:02.705
Yeah, because he wants me to fail.

09:02.705 --> 09:04.915
Which I've told you makes no sense.

09:04.915 --> 09:06.500
Unless he thinks I'm out for his job?

09:06.500 --> 09:08.919
- Which you are.
- Yeah, because I deserve it.

09:09.712 --> 09:11.087
For once, Mel,

09:11.087 --> 09:14.925
can we please not have
the same exact conversation

09:14.925 --> 09:18.721
on a Saturday night?
Which seems not insignificant.

09:21.639 --> 09:23.517
So, what did we decide about the paella?

09:26.728 --> 09:28.856
I think we decided that you can't say,

09:28.856 --> 09:31.065
"I might make paella"
and then get mad at me

09:31.065 --> 09:32.483
for saying I have to work.

09:33.234 --> 09:35.486
Especially when my job is on the line.

09:35.486 --> 09:37.822
You're acting like I have a choice here,
and I actually don't.

09:37.822 --> 09:39.532
That is not true, Mel.

09:39.532 --> 09:41.160
And you don't have to work.

09:41.160 --> 09:43.703
- You're choosing--
- You know what, honestly,

09:43.703 --> 09:46.956
maybe you're right.
Maybe it is significant.

09:48.667 --> 09:49.834
Why don't you just...

09:51.587 --> 09:55.548
make whatever you want...
for yourself. I don't know.

09:57.342 --> 10:01.597
When I'm done, I'll just come back
and grab my shit and take it to my place.

10:02.097 --> 10:03.015
What?

10:03.682 --> 10:07.685
Yeah, you know, I've just been, like,
rethinking my priorities recently and...

10:09.103 --> 10:10.064
you know...

10:11.357 --> 10:14.150
Wait, so this is what
we're talking about now?

10:16.362 --> 10:18.656
Yeah, this is what we're talking about.

10:18.656 --> 10:21.366
Mel, my God. You need help.

10:23.869 --> 10:28.373
Yes, hi. This is a mess...
a message for Mr. Widmer's office.

10:28.373 --> 10:32.211
This is Derek Browne
with an "e." I was a client and...

10:34.128 --> 10:36.089
not sure how much I can leave on here.

10:37.591 --> 10:40.385
He should remember.
It was... It's about...

10:40.885 --> 10:45.391
There was a family matter
a number of years ago and...

10:46.058 --> 10:48.309
Yeah, I'm sure he'll remember. I assume.

10:48.309 --> 10:50.561
Anyhow, I know it's a weekend.
I'm at the same number

10:50.561 --> 10:52.064
if he could just give me a call.

10:52.064 --> 10:54.358
Hey, look. Joey sent this. Look.

10:55.233 --> 10:59.196
"What's cooking?
You are. In hell, Chef Jeff."

11:15.754 --> 11:18.007
I got some bags.
They should be big enough.

11:47.618 --> 11:48.953
Come on. Load him up.

11:50.872 --> 11:54.460
Whoa, scunt. Man, what are we doing?
We don't even know where we going.

11:54.460 --> 11:56.170
Yeah, I know that,
but let's just do it now

11:56.170 --> 11:57.253
so we're ready, all right?

11:57.253 --> 12:00.591
Humor me. Get him in the bag. Get him
in the box. Stop asking me questions.

12:00.591 --> 12:01.800
If you so in charge,

12:01.800 --> 12:03.761
how come you don't know
where we actually going?

12:03.761 --> 12:05.720
I mean, seriously,
all y'all acting like amateurs.

12:05.720 --> 12:07.805
If Garmen ever saw
how you giving me attitude,

12:07.805 --> 12:10.058
questioning me, he'd think
I don't know how to run shit.

12:10.058 --> 12:11.642
I know how to run shit.

12:11.642 --> 12:14.521
That's why my auntie put me
in charge and not Garmen.

12:14.521 --> 12:17.106
We're going one of three places.
I came up with the plans.

12:17.106 --> 12:20.109
<i>- They gonna pick one.
- Is one of them three places the park?</i>

12:20.109 --> 12:22.195
<i>I already told you,
the park is a stupid idea.</i>

12:22.195 --> 12:24.573
<i>You see, this is what I mean.
None of you guys listen when I talk...</i>

12:24.573 --> 12:26.574
This is a fucking shit show.

12:26.574 --> 12:27.784
...because I'm speaking for her.

12:27.784 --> 12:29.161
<i>- You understand me?
- Victor, silencer.</i>

12:29.161 --> 12:30.871
<i>You better believe,
when it's all said and done,</i>

12:30.871 --> 12:32.247
I'll be giving her a full report.

12:59.233 --> 13:00.275
Aked, open up.

13:15.373 --> 13:19.837
- Garmen, Paul, other guy.
- This is Victor.

13:20.379 --> 13:21.337
Hello.

13:26.843 --> 13:30.389
- Is everything all right?
- U.S. Postal Inspection Service.

13:31.181 --> 13:34.310
We find this under one of your beds
from an Inspector Harmony.

13:35.602 --> 13:38.981
You know she? You? No?

13:40.941 --> 13:42.526
Whose bed was it under?

13:42.526 --> 13:44.652
Aked, you put the crew together, yes?

13:45.279 --> 13:47.197
- Yes, sir.
- Handpicked, I'm told.

13:48.948 --> 13:50.367
Garmen, is there a problem?

13:51.034 --> 13:53.786
Well, Mr. Handpick, potentially.

14:00.335 --> 14:03.380
What the fuck?
What the fuck? What the fuck?

14:04.131 --> 14:07.926
A few changes. First off,
he now goes with Victor.

14:07.926 --> 14:10.511
Paul stays in the van with you.
Where's the kid?

14:12.180 --> 14:13.265
Where the kid?

14:18.896 --> 14:20.689
There's no wire. There's no wire.

14:20.689 --> 14:23.442
That's what you thought it was?
It was a wire? That's what it was?

14:23.442 --> 14:25.485
We find the business card near he bed.

14:26.195 --> 14:28.030
Hey, tell the father Lower Manhattan.

14:28.030 --> 14:30.741
- Leave it at that.
- No, that's not the plan.

14:30.741 --> 14:33.951
- I had three choices.
- It was always the plan.

14:35.579 --> 14:38.415
- What are you talking ab--
- It was always the plan, Aked.

14:39.875 --> 14:42.628
That's your plan? To come in here?

14:43.586 --> 14:47.507
Us stepping in like this, right,
was only the backup plan.

14:55.391 --> 14:58.309
- All right, Washington Square Park now.
- What?

14:58.810 --> 15:00.729
That's a crowded park
in Downtown Manhattan.

15:00.729 --> 15:02.314
Why would we do that?

15:02.314 --> 15:04.233
That's what your auntie told Garmen.

15:06.401 --> 15:09.321
No, my auntie wouldn't come up
with a plan that stupid.

15:10.279 --> 15:12.700
My auntie wouldn't come up
with a plan like that.

15:22.542 --> 15:25.004
That's a little more
than 50 pounds in total.

15:25.004 --> 15:26.713
Use your knees, not your back.

15:28.548 --> 15:29.966
Good luck, Mr. Browne.

15:34.847 --> 15:37.557
- Well, I guess you better...
- Yeah, I know.

15:56.410 --> 15:58.704
- Yes, Len?
- Heading for the bridge.

15:58.704 --> 16:00.789
Excellent. Yes, keep following.

16:01.539 --> 16:03.207
- Thank you.
- You got it, ma'am.

16:16.637 --> 16:20.141
- Joey. Joey.
- Mr. McCusker. Ron Cuneo.

16:20.141 --> 16:21.518
We met at the casino.

16:21.518 --> 16:23.936
- I apologize about the business...
- Joey, hang on.

16:23.936 --> 16:26.397
- ...of the nature.
- Of course. Of course. Of course.

16:26.397 --> 16:27.607
It's a lot of money.

16:28.192 --> 16:29.485
Thank you for your understanding.

16:29.485 --> 16:33.113
Yeah, I'm going to talk
to my son-in-law. He handles the...

16:34.073 --> 16:38.327
the business money-wise,
and he'll make some arrangements.

16:38.327 --> 16:40.870
He'll sell something,
I don't know what he's gonna do.

16:40.870 --> 16:43.958
Also, if I may, my wife,
she loved your show,

16:43.958 --> 16:46.376
so if you don't mind,
I picked this up in the...

16:46.376 --> 16:48.629
at the casino gift shop, you know?

16:48.629 --> 16:50.714
Cuneo, what the hell are you doing?

16:51.548 --> 16:56.260
- I... I'm sorry, Mr. Tavari. I'm sorry.
- It's all right, Sy. It's what I do.

16:56.260 --> 16:58.888
Don't know how you guys do it,
you famous guys.

17:06.938 --> 17:09.565
- Where am I going?
- Lower Manhattan.

17:09.565 --> 17:10.818
Where in Lower Manhattan?

17:10.818 --> 17:13.069
- You gotta be more specific.
- I said Lower fucking Manhattan!

17:13.069 --> 17:15.656
<i>- That's all I know. I'll call you back.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait. No! N...</i>

17:42.432 --> 17:43.766
No fucking way.

17:47.229 --> 17:48.314
- Sam.
- Yeah?

17:49.815 --> 17:52.776
Do you think your Uncle Gene has...
has something to do with this?

17:53.443 --> 17:55.321
- Gene? Why?
- Yeah. I mean, my...

17:55.321 --> 17:58.614
my first thought was,
Gene was somehow involved.

17:58.614 --> 18:02.077
I don't... Somehow, I don't know how,
but that's what my gut says.

18:03.162 --> 18:05.663
Ge... Your dad wrote letters.

18:05.663 --> 18:08.041
He begged Aunt Cindy
just to give him some...

18:08.041 --> 18:10.043
a chance to explain to Gene

18:10.043 --> 18:12.338
that it wasn't your dad
who got him kicked off the force.

18:12.338 --> 18:13.380
Yeah, I have no idea.

18:13.380 --> 18:15.382
Wait, Derek's driving back
toward us. Is that weird?

18:15.382 --> 18:17.925
Gene and Cindy blame him for everything.

18:17.925 --> 18:18.926
Mom.

18:24.932 --> 18:26.267
- It's me. It's me.
- Hi.

18:26.267 --> 18:28.061
All is well. All is well.

18:28.061 --> 18:31.773
Your husband is off.
Everything's progressing.

18:31.773 --> 18:33.651
- The guys wanted to come by.
- Hi, Seymour. Hi.

18:33.651 --> 18:35.068
- Good to see you again, Sam.
- Hi.

18:35.068 --> 18:37.945
Apologies for the circumstance.
Sy, please.

18:38.822 --> 18:39.739
Hi.

18:53.628 --> 18:55.963
Do you have a charger? For, like, the car?

18:55.963 --> 18:57.256
Yeah. Great.

18:58.800 --> 19:00.968
- How much is it?
- It'll be 9.99.

19:02.011 --> 19:03.012
Keep it.

19:10.061 --> 19:12.355
Yeah, where am I going now? Hey! Hey!

19:13.940 --> 19:14.982
Sorry, go ahead.

19:14.982 --> 19:16.360
All right, there's a parking garage

19:16.360 --> 19:19.822
<i>on Houston between Broadway
and West Broadway. North side.</i>

19:19.822 --> 19:23.533
Okay, a parking garage
on Houston and what?

19:38.131 --> 19:41.259
<i>This cooperator who you were
not authorized to recruit</i>

19:41.259 --> 19:42.927
is clearly playing you.

19:42.927 --> 19:45.513
<i>First, he tells you
there's something happening in the park,</i>

19:45.513 --> 19:47.056
<i>- which you believed.
- I did.</i>

19:47.056 --> 19:49.684
<i>So, why don't you believe him
when he says nothing has happened?</i>

19:49.684 --> 19:52.270
Why can't the fact that I just don't
believe him this time be enough?

19:52.270 --> 19:56.108
<i>Because they whack people
in back alleys, not in public parks.</i>

19:56.108 --> 19:59.945
<i>And you're not on this case.
Officially or otherwise.</i>

19:59.945 --> 20:02.865
<i>And I'm with my daughter,
who I only get a few days a month.</i>

20:04.408 --> 20:07.952
So now we're actually getting to the point
which is that it's inconvenient for you.

20:07.952 --> 20:11.247
<i>And we can't risk you getting made,
and you don't have backup.</i>

20:11.247 --> 20:12.750
Well, then just get me a backup.

20:12.750 --> 20:16.461
<i>Which I can't do
on an unsanctioned stakeout, so...</i>

20:16.461 --> 20:18.379
No, no. I need to find out
why this guy is just

20:18.379 --> 20:20.381
- randomly pulling out--
- Take direction from me. Go home.

20:20.381 --> 20:22.134
- Manny. Manny, wait. Manny.
- Get with your life.

20:22.134 --> 20:24.093
- Manny. Manny.
- Hang on, Mae-Lee. I gotta go.

20:30.058 --> 20:31.142
Goddamn it.

21:09.639 --> 21:11.808
You're not... You're not...
Can you hear me now? Hear me?

21:11.808 --> 21:13.559
- Hear me? Ma'am...
- You handled everything in the van.

21:13.559 --> 21:15.270
<i>- Now everything is good.
- ...please, let me speak.</i>

21:15.270 --> 21:17.814
I think we're going to need more time
if we're going to do this correctly.

21:17.814 --> 21:20.442
<i>The principal, Clarence,
has been insistent about the timing,</i>

21:20.442 --> 21:21.610
but I'll think about it.

21:22.361 --> 21:24.487
M... Ma'am, you're not listening. Ma'am.

21:24.487 --> 21:26.406
- Thank you, Garmen.
- Just listen. Listen to me now...

21:34.205 --> 21:37.375
<i>Why aren't you at the garage yet?
I told you where it is.</i>

21:37.375 --> 21:38.876
I'm just about to pull in.

21:40.920 --> 21:42.965
<i>Are you actually trying
to get your kid killed?</i>

21:42.965 --> 21:45.133
<i>Because that's what's gonna happen
if we don't have that money</i>

21:45.133 --> 21:47.218
by 1:11 a.m. sharp. You know that, right?

21:47.760 --> 21:49.221
Your kid will die,

21:49.221 --> 21:51.681
<i>and it will be your fault
and your fault only.</i>

21:53.559 --> 21:57.395
- What the fuck?
- Hey, yo, you listening to me?

21:58.938 --> 22:02.025
- Jesus! Fucking...
- Are you talking to me right now?

22:02.025 --> 22:04.320
Because I'm not playing here. Hello!

22:05.863 --> 22:07.948
I'm at 1%. You gotta tell me where to go.

22:07.948 --> 22:09.283
Like, exactly.

22:09.283 --> 22:11.159
Apparently, Washington Square Park.

22:12.535 --> 22:13.494
Apparently?

22:13.494 --> 22:15.121
<i>Just get your ass there
before your phone dies.</i>

22:15.121 --> 22:16.081
The keys are inside.

22:16.081 --> 22:17.791
I'm sorry. They told me
this is where I should park.

22:17.791 --> 22:19.000
You're throwing this whole thing off.

22:19.000 --> 22:20.502
- I'm sorry.
- You shoulda been at the garage

22:20.502 --> 22:22.504
<i>- ten minutes ago.
- Listen, you got to chill the fuck out.</i>

22:22.504 --> 22:24.048
I'm literally doing everything you say.

22:24.048 --> 22:26.299
<i>Except be where
you're supposed to be on time.</i>

22:51.492 --> 22:52.576
Where are you now?

22:52.576 --> 22:55.412
I'm three blocks away.
Where do I go when I get there?

22:55.412 --> 22:57.498
<i>Okay, I'm going to walk you
through it when you're inside</i>

22:57.498 --> 22:59.207
because you gotta go to a specific cir--

22:59.207 --> 23:02.670
Hello? Go to the what? Go--

23:09.468 --> 23:11.135
- What?
- I think his phone just died.

23:12.805 --> 23:15.098
It's either that or he don't
give a fuck about his kid.

23:21.397 --> 23:23.232
Mel, do not call me

23:23.232 --> 23:25.441
<i>and try to say
what happened didn't happen.</i>

23:25.441 --> 23:28.403
<i>Which is you walked out
on me and this relationship.</i>

23:28.403 --> 23:31.073
This is me telling you we are over.

23:31.073 --> 23:33.616
<i>I'm ending the cycle
of break up and make up.</i>

23:34.909 --> 23:38.287
<i>So, just find what you're looking for
in the park. And I hope you do.</i>

23:38.287 --> 23:42.334
<i>I won't be there to hear about it.
I'm blocking you. You are blocked.</i>

23:57.515 --> 23:59.142
Ms. Mahabir, what you decided?

23:59.518 --> 24:02.354
I've decided to have
the principal call the van directly,

24:02.354 --> 24:04.481
and you're to take
the rest of the evening off.

24:04.481 --> 24:06.649
Okay. No, listen, you can't be ser--

24:06.649 --> 24:11.488
F... F... Fucking raas mother...

24:16.493 --> 24:20.204
- Hello, this is Paul.
- Hello, Paul. This is Clarence.

24:20.204 --> 24:22.708
<i>- Can you hear me?
- Yes, sir. I can hear you.</i>

24:22.708 --> 24:25.209
I understand you have some questions.

24:25.209 --> 24:27.837
We need more time. We need more time.

24:27.837 --> 24:29.380
Sir, my... my men were wondering

24:29.380 --> 24:32.967
if we could get some more time.
The money's almost here.

24:33.469 --> 24:37.264
<i>It must be completed
by 1:11 a.m. for the plan to work.</i>

24:38.765 --> 24:41.727
Yes, sir. Thank you.
If I may ask, why is that?

24:42.352 --> 24:46.022
It is because that is the time it must be.

25:05.875 --> 25:07.126
Hey, Louis, what are you doing?

25:07.126 --> 25:09.462
It's Jared phone
for when he returned to he family.

25:09.462 --> 25:11.674
Close the door.
We don't care about the phone.

25:11.674 --> 25:13.842
- What are you doing?
- Move, man. Move, move.

25:15.094 --> 25:19.264
- Do you know what we supposed to do?
- 1:11, I make shot in box.

25:20.099 --> 25:24.894
But first, we do a loop around the park
and meet over there by that white circle.

25:24.894 --> 25:27.271
Okay? Go. Go, go, go, go, go.

25:28.523 --> 25:32.361
And you, you stay with me,
okay? Always looking.

25:47.041 --> 25:50.296
Hey, rum raisin in a cone. Thank you.

25:50.296 --> 25:55.217
Xavier, either you think something
is happening tonight or you don't.

25:55.801 --> 25:59.138
But my life is falling apart,
and I will take yours down with me.

25:59.888 --> 26:02.516
So, get back in touch
and keep your promises,

26:02.516 --> 26:05.227
otherwise I'll drop mine,
and then we'll see where you stand.

26:05.978 --> 26:07.771
I'm serious. Goodbye.

26:09.439 --> 26:12.151
- Oh my God. Sorry.
- No problem.

26:35.548 --> 26:36.508
What, Manny?

26:37.551 --> 26:38.968
I'm telling you as a friend,

26:38.968 --> 26:41.639
<i>I... I won't be able to sleep
until you've gone home.</i>

26:42.347 --> 26:44.182
Well, you're not my friend,
you're my boss.

26:44.182 --> 26:47.895
<i>Okay, then as your boss,
I'm ordering you home.</i>

26:58.322 --> 26:59.698
Do you guys have a portable...

27:00.449 --> 27:03.077
Does anyone... anyone have a charger?

27:10.292 --> 27:11.669
Where were you, raas?

27:12.293 --> 27:14.254
- Where you been?
- Garmen killed Keesen.

27:14.254 --> 27:16.506
- Why?
- Me not know. Go, man, go.

27:21.845 --> 27:24.555
Clarence. Clarence. Here.

27:25.640 --> 27:28.226
- Clarence.
- Please, please. Thank you.

27:29.227 --> 27:31.270
- Come on. Come on. Come on.
- Some guy in the park.

27:31.270 --> 27:33.439
- He just... He's just manic.
- All right. I'll bring this back.

27:33.439 --> 27:35.818
I'm sorry. I promise. I'm sorry.

27:41.031 --> 27:41.989
Excuse me.

27:43.282 --> 27:46.328
Postal Inspection Service.
I'm a Postal Inspector.

27:47.621 --> 27:49.957
At least for now. Thank you.

27:56.337 --> 27:58.381
- What the fuck are you doing?
- What?

27:58.381 --> 28:00.092
I told you to go on a fast loop.

28:00.092 --> 28:02.720
- I do what you tell me though.
- Get inside. Get inside.

28:07.391 --> 28:08.599
- Victor.
- Nobody move.

28:11.519 --> 28:12.938
Victor, what's happening, man?

28:22.905 --> 28:25.575
Make it make sense, Victor.

28:30.455 --> 28:31.373
Come on.

28:47.388 --> 28:49.350
It's 1:11, I'm here!

28:54.897 --> 28:57.941
What happened? Are you kidding me?
What's... What's going on?

28:58.817 --> 29:02.154
- His fucking phone died.
- What? Is he okay? Is Derek okay?

29:03.697 --> 29:04.782
Sam!

29:06.699 --> 29:07.701
It's done.

29:10.870 --> 29:12.163
Okay, we go now.

29:13.498 --> 29:14.416
Slow.

29:18.419 --> 29:19.338
Slower.

29:48.449 --> 29:49.410
Derek!

29:50.911 --> 29:51.912
Derek!

30:20.732 --> 30:23.651
I just text you an address
for where to dump the bodies.

30:23.651 --> 30:25.779
Xavier will call you
when you're on your way back.

30:27.238 --> 30:28.198
All right.

30:32.369 --> 30:33.578
Yeah, Xavier will.

30:35.247 --> 30:37.791
Hey, let me know
if you need help with anything else.

30:37.791 --> 30:39.000
Aked, enough!

30:39.418 --> 30:41.085
You know I didn't angle for none of this.

30:41.085 --> 30:42.712
So what,
you think you better than me now?

30:42.712 --> 30:44.298
Hey, hey, hey, all right. Guys, come on.

30:45.798 --> 30:46.799
Derek!

30:49.427 --> 30:50.428
What happened?

30:50.970 --> 30:52.764
Someone said maybe a heart attack.

30:54.849 --> 30:55.768
Hey!

30:57.144 --> 30:58.061
Excuse me.

30:58.979 --> 31:01.315
- You have her charger?
- My charger?

31:06.402 --> 31:07.321
Thanks.

31:13.451 --> 31:18.831
Derek! Oh God! Oh God. Hey, hey.

31:19.457 --> 31:20.376
Hey.

31:21.669 --> 31:23.628
I can't tell if I'm sitting or standing.

31:25.297 --> 31:28.968
Oh, baby. You're sitting.
You're sitting, baby.

31:30.803 --> 31:33.805
I got a charger. I plugged it in.

31:36.599 --> 31:37.642
I plugged it in.

31:39.353 --> 31:42.189
Hey, babe, just give me one second.

31:47.653 --> 31:49.445
We're going to figure it all out.

31:49.445 --> 31:51.489
We're going to figure
everything out, okay?

31:51.489 --> 31:52.490
Excuse me.

31:53.951 --> 31:54.952
Sorry.

31:57.037 --> 31:57.954
Yeah.

32:33.782 --> 32:34.949
Not bad, right?

32:36.284 --> 32:39.538
Get away from it all. Sorry, no Wi-Fi.

32:41.415 --> 32:43.041
Play a game or something? Cards?

32:44.417 --> 32:45.586
Yeah.

32:45.586 --> 32:47.211
- Maybe tomorrow.
- Come here.

32:47.963 --> 32:48.922
Yeah.

33:01.685 --> 33:03.771
<i>Principal here?
Whatever the fuck that mean.</i>

33:04.271 --> 33:06.190
<i>- Apparently not.
- Did you talk to him?</i>

33:07.191 --> 33:10.777
<i>He sounded Guyanese.
Maybe even Portuguese Guyanese.</i>

33:11.444 --> 33:13.863
<i>Tell me something.
What do you think of Xavier?</i>

33:16.157 --> 33:17.868
I don't know. What do you think?

33:17.868 --> 33:18.869
Boys.

33:23.706 --> 33:24.582
Thank you.

33:26.502 --> 33:29.170
First of all, Ms. Mahabir,
sorry for questioning you.

33:29.170 --> 33:31.047
Things got a little crazy earlier on.

33:31.631 --> 33:32.549
Garmen...

33:35.594 --> 33:41.474
I met you all these years ago.
It was Ms. M or Savitri, even Savi.

33:41.474 --> 33:44.894
But tonight, it's Ms. Mahabir. It's Savi.

33:45.645 --> 33:47.689
- It's all good, my friend.
- All right.

33:48.399 --> 33:51.693
Hey, Savi, you got a second?

33:55.155 --> 33:56.322
There is a circle.

33:57.365 --> 34:01.662
If the circle is broken,
then there's an opening for misfortune.

34:02.286 --> 34:05.791
- Right.
- But we have met all conditions.

34:05.791 --> 34:08.919
Therefore, the circle is full
at long last.

34:09.253 --> 34:10.838
Therefore, we good.

34:12.714 --> 34:17.594
And the curse, my husband,
may he rest with the spirits,

34:17.594 --> 34:21.097
caused my family
all those years ago, is now lifted.

34:23.474 --> 34:28.772
What if the death
of poor Quincy was actually a gift?

34:28.772 --> 34:32.735
Oh, I'm sorry, Edward Chung
basically assassinated...

34:32.735 --> 34:34.902
- Just a what-if, Garmen.
- ...Quincy, Savi.

34:35.362 --> 34:36.322
Think about it.

34:38.449 --> 34:40.784
Had my brother-in-law
not have been killed,

34:40.784 --> 34:43.745
I would not have suspected the curse.

34:43.745 --> 34:45.663
And now everything back in GT,

34:45.663 --> 34:48.917
our business has been settled,
and our business here...

34:50.501 --> 34:51.795
can resume as usual.

34:54.505 --> 34:55.506
Don't worry.

34:57.300 --> 34:58.384
Be happy.

35:02.640 --> 35:04.475
Mr. Willoughby.

35:05.351 --> 35:07.560
- Come.
- Oh, wonderful to see you.

35:07.560 --> 35:08.896
- Is it okay?
- Absolutely.

35:08.896 --> 35:10.605
Yeah, all right. Come this side.

35:19.365 --> 35:22.201
I think we're okay
with the information we have for now.

35:22.993 --> 35:28.873
Given the nature of all this
and your father's, I guess, profile,

35:29.457 --> 35:31.794
they may be bringing in
a sister agency or two.

35:32.461 --> 35:34.587
So somebody will contact you
as early as tomorrow.

35:36.632 --> 35:37.549
If I may...

35:38.800 --> 35:41.261
you can't blame yourself
for the actions of a maniac.

35:44.514 --> 35:46.308
Do you have any idea who the...

35:47.851 --> 35:48.894
- Sorry.
- The victim?

35:48.894 --> 35:52.147
Yeah, this is where my mind is.
Yeah. Of course. Yeah.

35:54.440 --> 35:56.109
I'm sure in the next day or two,

35:56.109 --> 35:58.445
we'll get a call
from a terrified mom or dad.

35:59.278 --> 36:00.489
That'll be a tough one.

36:01.823 --> 36:04.909
Meantime, maybe a little rest...

36:06.494 --> 36:07.578
go hug your kid.

36:09.038 --> 36:10.081
I'm sorry?

36:11.791 --> 36:13.209
I said go hug your kid.

36:30.728 --> 36:34.230
Twenty-eight thousand,
four hundred and twenty-five...

36:35.565 --> 36:36.483
people.

36:37.275 --> 36:39.194
He had Brenda research
how many people went

36:39.194 --> 36:41.362
through the service kitchen
and shelter program.

36:43.324 --> 36:44.991
How you doing? Okay?

36:44.991 --> 36:48.579
I've always said,
you put good things out there,

36:49.162 --> 36:50.788
good things come back around.

36:53.709 --> 36:57.170
And from that standpoint,
this whole thing makes no sense.

36:58.422 --> 37:02.926
Joey, hi. We're home.
Just seeing if he's up.

37:03.718 --> 37:06.305
No worries. Just call
when you... when you get this.

37:06.305 --> 37:09.515
Or I guess we'll...
we'll talk at our time.

37:10.851 --> 37:11.768
Thank you.

37:12.561 --> 37:17.398
I mean, what do I do?
What I do is walk the walk.

37:17.899 --> 37:22.237
Case in point, this guy Clarence flies
to New York just to meet me.

37:22.738 --> 37:26.116
- You played chess with a fan.
- It wasn't a fan, it was a friend.

37:26.699 --> 37:28.785
- It was a new friend.
- Okay, Dad.

37:29.952 --> 37:32.622
- Where are you going?
- Where do you think?

37:42.091 --> 37:43.092
Hey.

37:44.802 --> 37:46.177
You think that boy's dead?

37:47.011 --> 37:48.973
I don't know. I hope not.

37:50.891 --> 37:54.019
It could have been Jared.
It should have been Jared.

37:55.520 --> 37:56.855
You can't blame yourself.

37:57.522 --> 38:00.108
You did what you could for a stranger.

38:01.443 --> 38:02.652
I'm proud of you.
