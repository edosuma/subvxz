But could you travel the length

00:34.827 --> 00:37.413
of Latin America
at ground level?

00:37.448 --> 00:40.551
And all for the
price of the airfare?

00:40.586 --> 00:42.379
[Man] What have
we got ourselves into?

00:42.413 --> 00:46.034
[Narrator] Five pairs of ordinary

Got no Google maps.
Got no mom. Got nothing.

01:24.000 --> 01:27.103

Yeah, kinda.

02:11.482 --> 02:12.482
- [Rob] Jen.
- [Jen] What?

02:12.517 --> 02:14.044
- This way. Come this way.
- Why am I following you?

02:14.068 --> 02:15.793
Just follow you
around like a wench.

02:15.827 --> 02:17.206
[Narrator] After a bus stop...

02:17.241 --> 02:20.172
[Jen] That fight we
had was just so awful.

02:20.206 --> 02:22.379
[Narrator] ...Jen and
Rob bounce back.

02:22.413 --> 02:25.068
It feels a little bit to me
like a bit of a turning point.

02:25.103 --> 02:27.517
[Sam] With hope to... I feel
at peace here. I feel at home.

02:27.551 --> 02:29.758
[Narrator] While a
revitalized Sam...

02:29.793 --> 02:32.068
[All speaking in Spanish]

02:32.103 --> 02:33.517
[Narrator] Was in his element.

02:33.551 --> 02:37.103
[Jo] It's very special when
your own child can advise you.

02:37.137 --> 02:39.793
- [Narrator] A health scare for dom...
- [Lizzie] Oh, dom.

02:39.827 --> 02:42.724
- That was petrifying.
- [Narrator] ...Saw Lizzie step up...

02:42.758 --> 02:44.758
Maybe for a few days
I'll be taking control.

02:44.793 --> 02:46.941
- [Narrator] ...Before another emergency.
- [Cell phone ringing]

02:46.965 --> 02:49.793
Civil unrest in Chile,
need to evacuate asap.

02:49.827 --> 02:52.034
[Narrator] ...Left them in
a race to cross the border.

02:52.068 --> 02:53.493

catch up with the teams.

02:53.517 --> 02:55.758
[Narrator] And the
only team yet to reach

02:55.793 --> 02:57.655
the fifth checkpoint
in Argentina.

03:00.586 --> 03:01.862
[Birds chirping]

03:12.379 --> 03:13.931
[Dom] We're not quitters.

03:18.103 --> 03:21.896
[Narrator] One day and five and a
half hours behind the race leaders...

03:21.931 --> 03:24.931
[Dom] Oh, my god, the check
point I've been longing for.

03:24.965 --> 03:28.000
[Narrator] ...Dom and Lizzie
arrive in cafayate in Argentina.

03:32.724 --> 03:35.034
- Shock...
- [Lizzie] But in last.

03:35.068 --> 03:38.206
It's okay, well, what
we expected anyway.

03:38.241 --> 03:42.172
This has been by far the most
dramatic leg we've had in this race.

03:42.206 --> 03:45.172
Probably the most dramatic
five days I've ever had in my life.

03:45.206 --> 03:46.620
I can... I can agree with that.

03:47.620 --> 03:50.172
- Aw, guys.
- You made it.

03:50.206 --> 03:53.965
-I mean, hardly. A lot of stories to tell.
-[Man] Oh, god.

03:54.000 --> 03:56.344
[Dom] It's been one
hurdle after another

03:56.379 --> 04:00.620
- that we've just about managed to scrape ourselves over.
- [Laughs]

04:00.655 --> 04:02.896
[Dom] We were waiting
to get a bus to Chile,

04:02.931 --> 04:06.034
I stood up and
basically just collapsed.

04:06.068 --> 04:09.551
- Oh, my gosh.
- It was the scariest thing.

04:09.586 --> 04:10.931
You know, we got good treatment.

04:10.965 --> 04:12.275
Don was really
looked after well.

04:12.310 --> 04:14.931
Right, I'm amused
you're here, to be fair.

04:14.965 --> 04:16.931
For dom to, you know, carry on

04:16.965 --> 04:19.827
with the race and the journey,
it just shows his character.

04:19.862 --> 04:22.413
-That he's determined.
-[Jamiul] Strong. Strong willed.

04:22.448 --> 04:25.482
Uh, I'm not sure what I'd do in that
situation. I might probably go home.

04:25.517 --> 04:29.000
And then Chile called a state of
emergency. So we got evacuated.

04:29.034 --> 04:31.320
- They were blocking the road. Stopping...
- doors were shutting.

04:31.344 --> 04:32.527
We were... Yeah, it was serious.

04:32.551 --> 04:34.241
We just so wanted
to see you guys.

04:34.275 --> 04:36.217
- We didn't wanna come...
- We thought you were all gonna be gone

04:36.241 --> 04:38.275
- by the time we got here.
- Time we got here.

04:38.310 --> 04:40.068
[Rob] We're taking
different routes.

04:40.103 --> 04:42.275
We have come across
different challenges,

04:42.310 --> 04:44.251
- but there's something that keeps us together.
- [Jen] Yeah.

04:44.275 --> 04:45.965
A little family.

04:46.000 --> 04:48.482
It is about getting to the
end because it shows us

04:48.517 --> 04:51.344
how volatile and
fragile this race could be.

04:51.379 --> 04:53.517
-[Emon] Still here. Still in the race.
-[Lizzie] Right.

04:53.551 --> 04:57.620
- [All laugh]
- [Indistinct chatter]

04:57.655 --> 05:00.517
[Narrator] A s the finish
line draws ever closer

05:00.551 --> 05:03.551
12,000 kilometers
away in ushuaia,

05:03.586 --> 05:05.896
budgets are
becoming ever tighter.

05:09.275 --> 05:10.551
[Birds screeches]

05:17.103 --> 05:18.344
[Narrator] 4:40 A.M.

05:18.379 --> 05:20.965
[All speaking in Spanish]

05:21.000 --> 05:24.172
[Narrator in English] An early start
for race leaders emon and jamiul.

05:25.172 --> 05:26.379
[Man speaking in Spanish]

05:26.413 --> 05:28.310
[Jamiul] Ilha grande.

05:28.344 --> 05:29.551
How do you pronounce that?

05:29.586 --> 05:31.448
- Ilha.
- Ilha grande.

05:31.482 --> 05:33.172
Thank you very much.

05:34.758 --> 05:35.827
There.

05:35.862 --> 05:37.827
Ilha grande, Brazil.

05:37.862 --> 05:39.689
- [Jamiul] Brazil? [Groans]
- [Emon] Amazing.

05:40.862 --> 05:42.724
[Narrator] The
teams are setting off

05:42.758 --> 05:45.448
on the longest leg
of the race so far.

05:45.482 --> 05:48.241
A 3,600 kilometer journey

05:48.275 --> 05:52.275
heading east across the
continent for the first time

05:52.310 --> 05:56.689
to take in South America's
number one tourist destination Brazil.

05:59.655 --> 06:01.586
Just off the Atlantic coast,

06:01.620 --> 06:05.517
positioned between Rio de
Janeiro and Sao Paulo, ilha grande.

06:07.068 --> 06:11.344
Once a pirate's hideout,
now an island paradise.

06:14.241 --> 06:15.931
[Birds chirping]

06:15.965 --> 06:17.838
[Jamiul] It's a bit of a
weird way to go, innit?

06:17.862 --> 06:19.344
Right across country.

06:19.379 --> 06:20.862
So, what'd you wanna do?

06:20.896 --> 06:23.689
Straight from, uh, Argentina
and straight to Brazil.

06:23.724 --> 06:26.448
Or do we go for Paraguay?

06:26.482 --> 06:30.137
[Narrator] The most direct route
to ilha grande is through Paraguay.

06:30.172 --> 06:34.172
A hidden gem of the region
known as El corazon De america,

06:34.206 --> 06:36.689
heart of the Americas.

06:36.724 --> 06:40.241
Or the teams could risk
adding a further 200 kilometers

06:40.275 --> 06:43.034
in order to pick up
Brazil's coastal highway

06:43.068 --> 06:46.379
that could accelerate them
north towards the sixth checkpoint.

06:47.206 --> 06:48.586
[Emon] Looking up Paraguay,

06:48.620 --> 06:50.862
there's a direct road,
border to border.

06:50.896 --> 06:52.655
Just go straight
through Paraguay.

06:52.689 --> 06:55.310
- Yeah.
- Then we'll hit another country as well.

06:55.344 --> 06:56.493
[Jamiul] Yeah, I
would love to do that.

06:56.517 --> 06:57.965
[Emon] Yeah, I
would love to do that.

06:58.000 --> 07:01.827
-[Jamiul] Let's get going. Make decisions on the way.
-[Emon] Yeah.

07:01.862 --> 07:03.758
[Jamiul] We're wanna
get to the bus station.

07:05.758 --> 07:07.034
We're in first place now.

07:07.068 --> 07:10.068
[Emon] A few more legs to
go. And I think hitting our peak.

07:10.103 --> 07:11.838
- We've opened up to each other a bit more.
- [Jamiul] Yeah.

07:11.862 --> 07:15.217
[Emon] We're getting closer, we're getting
more connected. Especially on the last leg.

07:15.241 --> 07:17.275
I think, uh, that's
made us a better team.

07:17.310 --> 07:19.206
[Emon] This is the
business end of the season,

07:19.241 --> 07:21.103
- as Fergie once said.
- [Jamiul laughs]

07:21.137 --> 07:22.620
Thank you very much, ciao.

07:22.655 --> 07:25.068
[Narrator] To reach
Paraguay from cafayate,

07:25.103 --> 07:28.586
the boys must head back
to the transport hub of salta.

07:28.620 --> 07:32.206
[Emon] Jen and Rob are a few
hours behind. They'll be right on our tail.

07:36.379 --> 07:37.793
[Rob] Brazil?

07:37.827 --> 07:40.827
- Portuguese language.
- Oh, yeah, we're going through iguazu falls.

07:40.862 --> 07:42.724
One of the seven wonders
of the natural world.

07:42.758 --> 07:44.551
Yeah, it looks
pretty incredible.

07:44.586 --> 07:47.551
[Narrator] Just four hours
behind, Jen and Rob...

07:47.586 --> 07:49.655
We haven't made the
most of Bolivia, have we?

07:49.689 --> 07:51.079
We should have been
out seeing the sights,

07:51.103 --> 07:54.000
but instead, we were
punching each other and crying.

07:54.586 --> 07:56.379
[Chuckles]

07:56.413 --> 07:58.689
I hate the person that
this race has made me.

07:58.724 --> 08:00.275
- [Laughs]
- I do.

08:00.310 --> 08:04.068
She's awful, she's emotionally
unstable, she's irrational.

08:04.103 --> 08:06.379
Because at home, I honestly
don't believe I'm like this.

08:07.379 --> 08:09.586
- I...
- [Both laugh]

08:09.620 --> 08:12.551
If we want to do iguazu
falls, which is on route,

08:12.586 --> 08:15.689
it's going to be quicker to
go through Paraguay, I think.

08:15.724 --> 08:17.241
[Jen] It looks quick in my eyes.

08:17.275 --> 08:20.000
[Narrator] Also planning
to head through Paraguay,

08:20.034 --> 08:24.000
Jen and Rob came to visit
the world famous iguazu falls

08:24.034 --> 08:27.000
just across the
border in Brazil.

08:27.034 --> 08:28.314
[Jen] I want to go home and say,

08:28.344 --> 08:29.872
- i had a really amazing time...
- [Rob] Mmm.

08:29.896 --> 08:33.068
Rather than a race so hard I
didn't see any of it and we still lost.

08:35.827 --> 08:39.896
[Narrator] Emon and jamiul
have reached salta bus station.

08:39.931 --> 08:43.655
- [Jamiul] Perdón, um, we wanna get to... yeah.
- [Emon] Paraguay.

08:43.689 --> 08:46.379
[Narrator] Aiming for
Paraguay's capital, Asunción?

08:47.241 --> 08:50.137
[Woman in Spanish]

08:50.172 --> 08:51.493
[Jamiul in English]
All right, okay.

08:51.517 --> 08:54.344
- [Emon] No direct transición?
- [Woman speaking]

08:54.379 --> 08:56.241
Let's book it, man.

08:56.275 --> 08:58.413
[Narrator] On a bus
leaving in three hours.

08:58.448 --> 09:00.310
[Jamiul] We just spent
two days', uh, budget.

09:00.344 --> 09:03.137
So, when we get to Asunción,
I've checked the classifieds

09:03.172 --> 09:06.482
and there's like an elderly people's
home that we can go work at.

09:06.517 --> 09:08.757
- Which I think could be pretty cool.
- I like old people.

09:13.448 --> 09:15.931
[Jen] The boys are
here, I've seen the boys.

09:15.965 --> 09:17.931
Hey, hey, hey.

09:17.965 --> 09:19.689
[Narrator] But they're
not the only team

09:19.724 --> 09:23.310
looking for the best route to Paraguay
among the terminal's many kiosks.

09:24.413 --> 09:26.172
[Emon] You saw your travel log?

09:26.206 --> 09:28.379
- Clorinda, the border town.
- Clorinda?

09:28.413 --> 09:30.896
- You got Paraguay, right?
- Are you going straight to Asunción?

09:30.931 --> 09:33.655
- No, we're going to, uh...
- Formosa.

09:33.689 --> 09:35.275
- Formosa.
- [Jen] Oh, okay.

09:36.689 --> 09:38.172
[Rob] Safe travel, boys.

09:38.206 --> 09:40.310
- Goodbye, ta-ta.
- [Jamiul] They going to clorinda.

09:40.344 --> 09:42.758
- Be good.
- [Emon] They're going to the border.

09:42.793 --> 09:44.206
The actual border.

09:45.793 --> 09:46.827
It's a bit annoying.

09:46.862 --> 09:48.965
[Narrator] While the boys
need to change buses

09:49.000 --> 09:51.724
at formosa from the
border town of clorinda.

09:51.758 --> 09:55.827
Jen and Rob have found a
bus to take them straight there.

09:55.862 --> 09:59.482
We potentially have
a chance to overtake.

09:59.517 --> 10:02.517
But you cannot get excited about
potentially having a lead on day one.

10:02.551 --> 10:06.275
But what it does do, it fills us with
confidence that we're well in the game.

10:07.827 --> 10:11.068
-No, no, no, no. We must not get complacent.
-No.

10:11.103 --> 10:12.551
[Narrator] 11:00 A.M.

10:12.586 --> 10:14.448
[Sam] So I excited to go Brazil.

10:14.482 --> 10:18.344
- Brazil just reminds me of Shakira for some reason.
- [Jo chuckles]

10:18.379 --> 10:20.655
[Narrator] Next to
leave, Jo and Sam.

10:20.689 --> 10:22.931
- [Sam] Before there, we have to go there.
- [Jo] Yeah.

10:22.965 --> 10:27.620
- Uh, we probably won't make there.
- [Jo] We are low on budget.

10:27.655 --> 10:29.965
We really do need
to work on this leg.

10:30.000 --> 10:31.896
There's a job in
the Atlantic coast.

10:31.931 --> 10:33.862
There's a family
of experts surfers.

10:33.896 --> 10:36.793
Make sure you ask for a
free lesson in return for work,

10:36.827 --> 10:38.448
and that's bed and board.

10:38.482 --> 10:41.827
- I think that sounds like a good plan, don't you think?
- [Sam] Yeah, it does.

10:41.862 --> 10:44.241
We've had a really lovely
experience in Argentina

10:44.275 --> 10:46.689
because we spent a day
and a night with a family.

10:46.724 --> 10:49.206
I loved how they
appreciated what they have.

10:49.241 --> 10:50.413
[Jo] It's really humbling.

10:50.448 --> 10:52.482
[Sam] It gave me a
different perspective.

10:52.517 --> 10:54.931
I don't think a place could
actually do that to someone.

10:54.965 --> 10:59.103
[Narrator] Joe and Sam aim to cross
directly from Argentina into Brazil.

10:59.137 --> 11:02.551
Tempted by a job and to
surf on the Atlantic coast.

11:02.586 --> 11:04.655
[Jo] This leg, I think
it's all about money

11:04.689 --> 11:06.862
and, um, making smart decisions.

11:06.896 --> 11:09.034
- [Sam] I'll accept it this time.
- Okay, love.

11:10.551 --> 11:13.827
[Narrator] But with
2,500 kilometers to cover,

11:13.862 --> 11:17.275
the can ill afford the air
conditioned comfort that Sam favors.

11:19.275 --> 11:21.413
[Sam groans]

11:21.448 --> 11:25.448
- I wonder if anyone will actually stop.
- [Jo] We will see.

11:32.172 --> 11:35.172
- You are a rubbish hitchhiker.
- [Sam blubbering]

11:36.586 --> 11:39.827
[Sam] Like, I am bored.

11:39.862 --> 11:44.068
When I was in school, like,
I used to get in trouble a lot.

11:44.103 --> 11:45.344
[Yells]

11:45.379 --> 11:48.482
I would be sat in there
bored, then I'd start fiddling.

11:48.517 --> 11:50.241
I'd always distract people.

11:50.275 --> 11:55.172
I'd never be able to sit there
and concentrate on anything.

11:55.206 --> 11:56.655
Hey, rattle snakes.

11:57.724 --> 11:59.241
The teacher would tell me off.

11:59.275 --> 12:02.379
And then it would just
escalate from there onwards.

12:03.275 --> 12:04.241
- So...
- Yeah.

12:04.275 --> 12:05.389
That's about right, isn't it?

12:05.413 --> 12:07.448
Usually it ended with a
chair through a window,

12:07.482 --> 12:09.355
- or something like that.
- I didn't want to put up with it.

12:09.379 --> 12:10.724
[Both chuckle]

12:10.758 --> 12:13.379
- I thought I saw you crying at something, right?
- Yeah, sure did.

12:13.413 --> 12:15.896
[Mockingly whining]

12:15.931 --> 12:19.793
You are the biggest reason
why I never lost faith in myself.

12:19.827 --> 12:23.931
[Jo] I just hope that this
just builds on our relationship

12:23.965 --> 12:26.310
rather than destroy
it. [Chuckles]

12:26.931 --> 12:29.413
It would be really sad.

12:29.448 --> 12:32.068
-You're my mum, I love you. I couldn't...
-I love you, too.

12:32.103 --> 12:34.000
Yeah, we... We'll
get through it.

12:34.034 --> 12:37.137
We'll get through it, whatever
way. [Inhales] Won't we?

12:37.758 --> 12:39.965
[Sam] Yeah.

12:40.000 --> 12:42.620
Okay, love. We're given
it half an hour hitching.

12:42.655 --> 12:44.862
We'll need to make it
way back to the bus station.

12:46.586 --> 12:49.000
'Cause it looks like we're
having a night in salta.

12:54.000 --> 12:56.827
[Rob] We need to get to the
border, which is a taxi ride away.

13:00.517 --> 13:02.275
[Narrator] Having
reached clorinda...

13:02.310 --> 13:05.793
I am gonna need to brush
my teeth and have a wee.

13:05.827 --> 13:07.724
[Narrator] Jen and
Rob are on course

13:07.758 --> 13:10.206
to be the first team
to cross into Paraguay.

13:10.241 --> 13:12.172
- [Rob] Is this it?
- [Jen] No way.

13:12.206 --> 13:13.206
[Blows whistle]

13:13.241 --> 13:15.103
- [Jen] That's the border?
- [Rob] Border?

13:15.137 --> 13:16.896
[Driver speaking in Spanish]

13:16.931 --> 13:19.862
[Jen chuckles] Okay. It
doesn't look like a border.

13:19.896 --> 13:22.586
[Narrator] They've arrived
at the crossing used by locals

13:22.620 --> 13:25.241
to visit the market
district of San Antonio.

13:25.275 --> 13:26.206
[Jen chuckles]

13:26.241 --> 13:28.965
This just is suspicious as hell.

13:29.000 --> 13:30.217
- [Rob chuckles]
- [Vehicle honks]

13:30.241 --> 13:31.921
[Narrator] Three
kilometers to the north...

13:33.655 --> 13:34.734
[Emon] Paraguay, here we come.

13:34.758 --> 13:35.838
[Jamiul] Another
day, another border.

13:35.862 --> 13:37.689
[Narrator] Emon and
jamiul's roundabout route

13:37.724 --> 13:40.241
has brought them to the
main highway crossing

13:40.275 --> 13:42.517
to Paraguay's capital, Asunción.

13:42.551 --> 13:44.379
- [Jamiul] Asunción?
- [Emon] Asunción?

13:47.758 --> 13:50.137
[Jen] So, is this
literally Paraguay?

13:50.172 --> 13:53.172
-[Rob] Yeah.
-[Jen chuckles] Oh, my days.

13:53.206 --> 13:54.793
I just don't understand.

13:54.827 --> 13:57.758
I mean, are we at the border crossing
or at east gate market, like what?

13:57.793 --> 13:59.172
[Rob chuckles]

14:00.310 --> 14:02.344
- [Jen] Down here.
- [Rob] Ah, here you go.

14:02.379 --> 14:04.059
[Jen] Looks like it
might be a bus station.

14:05.172 --> 14:07.896
Oh, my days. No.

14:07.931 --> 14:11.413
How this queue is. I'm
desperate for a wee as well.

14:13.034 --> 14:16.000
We probably should get price for
a taxi, just so we can compare it.

14:19.034 --> 14:21.931
My only concern is that
this queue is growing

14:21.965 --> 14:23.148
and growing and
growing and growing.

14:23.172 --> 14:25.275
- It's not...
- One of us can stay in the queue

14:25.310 --> 14:26.931
and one of us can go.

14:26.965 --> 14:29.275
[Rob] Yeah, that's
right. I'll stay here.

14:29.310 --> 14:30.689
I'm not gonna walk off on my own

14:30.724 --> 14:32.631
in the middle of a country
that I've never been to my life.

14:32.655 --> 14:34.793
It's just over there.
The taxi's just over here.

14:36.344 --> 14:37.689
You want me to go, don't you?

14:37.724 --> 14:39.000
- Yeah.
- [Chuckles]

14:40.448 --> 14:42.448
[Rob] Although she might like

14:42.482 --> 14:45.103
to think I'm under her thumb...

14:45.137 --> 14:46.862
[Both speaking in Spanish]

14:48.586 --> 14:51.413
[In English] ...I let her think
that she's got control of me.

14:51.448 --> 14:54.344
But really, I don't
think that's the case.

14:54.379 --> 14:55.586
[Speaking in Spanish]

14:56.448 --> 14:59.206
[In English] Uh, 300?

14:59.241 --> 15:00.275
Uh...

15:01.137 --> 15:02.137
[In Spanish]

15:04.275 --> 15:06.068
[Rob] $5.

15:06.103 --> 15:07.424
- [In English] Okay.
- [Indistinct chatter]

15:07.448 --> 15:08.482
[Speaks in Spanish]

15:09.241 --> 15:10.241
Right...

15:11.068 --> 15:13.103
[Jen] Here he is,
the man of the hour.

15:13.137 --> 15:14.965
[Rob] Okay, this might
be a better option.

15:15.000 --> 15:19.689
So, to get to the center
with five us or 300 local

15:19.724 --> 15:21.413
garudas or
something it's called.

15:21.448 --> 15:24.586
- Okay, I think we're better off doing that.
- [Rob] Yeah, let's do it.

15:25.379 --> 15:27.586
So, um, terminal...

15:28.827 --> 15:34.034
- Asunción in us dollars.
- [Speaks in Spanish]

15:36.241 --> 15:38.793
[Jen] See, now it's gone to $70.

15:38.827 --> 15:42.413
That's it, I'm just confused.
It's written $5, Robbie.

15:42.448 --> 15:47.275
Oh, well, he put up five...
He'd put up five fingers up.

15:47.310 --> 15:48.310
So, I out five.

15:48.344 --> 15:50.689
- But I think, actually...
- So, you've written that.

15:51.758 --> 15:54.103
[Stammers]

15:54.137 --> 15:56.148
- I think I wrote the five.
- Well, that was a waste of time.

15:56.172 --> 15:57.793
Right, get back in the queue.

15:57.827 --> 16:01.620
[Narrator] After more than five weeks
traveling in Spanish speaking nations...

16:01.655 --> 16:03.137
[Jen] Where did five come from?

16:03.172 --> 16:05.827
[Narrator] ...Language
is still a barrier.

16:05.862 --> 16:08.275
You did this, you got us
out of the bloody queue.

16:09.655 --> 16:11.896
[Narrator] 850
kilometers to the west...

16:11.931 --> 16:13.344
[Speaks in Spanish]

16:13.379 --> 16:16.137
[Narrator] ...And the last to
leave cafayate, dom and Lizzie,

16:16.172 --> 16:19.482
determined to catch up
almost 30 hours on the leaders.

16:19.517 --> 16:22.517
Our next checkpoint
is ilha grande.

16:22.551 --> 16:23.931
[Dom] We're quite far behind.

16:23.965 --> 16:26.206
But now we're full steam ahead.

16:26.241 --> 16:27.620
Even if we get...
Come last in it,

16:27.655 --> 16:29.310
its only by one
hour. We'll be happy.

16:29.344 --> 16:30.976
'Cause that means we
tried and we've done well.

16:31.000 --> 16:32.482
- No, I won't be.
- Okay.

16:32.517 --> 16:34.172
I want to win still.

16:34.206 --> 16:37.448
- Can we book a taxi from here?
- Yes, of course.

16:37.482 --> 16:41.655
If you think about the amount of
time we have left, then it's achievable.

16:41.689 --> 16:45.482
- Quickly grab your map.
- Um, I don't think I've got it.

16:45.517 --> 16:47.389
- But, okay.
- [Dom] You don't think you have it?

16:47.413 --> 16:49.965
Lizzie, you definitely had it.

16:51.620 --> 16:52.689
100%.

16:54.103 --> 16:55.275
I had the travel guide,

16:55.310 --> 16:57.034
- you had the map.
- [Lizzie] It's not here.

16:59.310 --> 17:00.655
We don't have a map.

17:00.689 --> 17:04.448
-[Dom sighs] Lizzie. [Chuckles]
-It's my fault, obviously.

17:04.482 --> 17:06.448
Right, well...

17:07.586 --> 17:09.068
[Lizzie] Let's go for a walk.

17:10.896 --> 17:12.620
[Dom] Lizzie!

17:12.655 --> 17:15.517
[Lizzie] Just let me be alone.

17:15.551 --> 17:17.620
She thinks she has the
right just to have a stroll

17:17.655 --> 17:20.931
every single time
something like this happens.

17:20.965 --> 17:23.689
Lizzie, come back now!

17:23.724 --> 17:26.379
I've tried so hard to
sympathize with her

17:26.413 --> 17:27.689
and not get angry,

17:27.724 --> 17:30.517
but right now it's
getting on my tits.

17:32.551 --> 17:34.931
The map is gone,
irrelevant, doesn't matter.

17:34.965 --> 17:37.551
- Done, blip, blap, done.
- Okay.

17:37.586 --> 17:40.137
[Dom] We need to now
think about how, tactically,

17:40.172 --> 17:42.620
we're going to catch
up with everyone else.

17:42.655 --> 17:45.448
I do not want another rubbish,

17:45.482 --> 17:48.172
- sort of, negative leg.
- Nor do I. Nor do I.

17:48.206 --> 17:51.896
I feel like I can be quite
fierce with Lizzie sometimes,

17:51.931 --> 17:54.482
but I want her to
have the confidence

17:54.517 --> 17:57.931
to be able just to tell herself that
even if she does something wrong,

17:57.965 --> 17:59.620
you know, it's not
the end of the world.

17:59.655 --> 18:01.206
I can come back
better and stronger.

18:01.241 --> 18:04.344
'Cause she's definitely
got the ability to do so.

18:04.379 --> 18:08.172
It's just asking the right people
who might be willing to help.

18:08.206 --> 18:10.034
[Both speaking in Spanish]

18:14.896 --> 18:17.034
- [In English] Oh, okay.
- [Both speaking in Spanish]

18:18.655 --> 18:19.793
[Dom in English] Okay.

18:19.827 --> 18:21.517
Come on. Let's do this.

18:21.551 --> 18:23.724
[Narrator] This this dom's
plan to tap up the locals

18:23.758 --> 18:26.551
immediately pays dividends.

18:26.586 --> 18:30.068
They've discovered the most
direct route to the Brazilian border,

18:30.103 --> 18:34.517
starting with a 19 hour
express journey to corrientes.

18:34.551 --> 18:36.389
[Dom] I'm sorry that I
put that pressure on you,

18:36.413 --> 18:38.148
- but I'm not coming last again.
- [Lizzie] No, it's...

18:38.172 --> 18:39.896
No, I don't wanna
come last again.

18:39.931 --> 18:42.551
[Narrator] Closing the
gap on Jo and Sam,

18:42.586 --> 18:45.241
who, after there unsuccessful,
attempted at hitchhiking,

18:45.275 --> 18:49.551
were unable to catch a bus
out of salta until this morning.

18:49.586 --> 18:51.103
[Sam] Back on the road.

18:51.137 --> 18:54.275
- I'm just so excited to go to Brazil.
- Yeah, I know.

18:54.310 --> 18:58.000
The music, the color. I like how
everyone's just always on the beach.

18:58.034 --> 19:01.000
There might be some
nice girls on the beach.

19:01.034 --> 19:04.689
- Just stop talking about girls, mum, it's just cringy.
- [Chuckles]

19:06.586 --> 19:08.310

19:10.275 --> 19:14.344
emon and jamiul arrive in
Paraguay's capital, Asunción.

19:16.689 --> 19:19.965
Located on the left bank
of the Paraguay river,

19:20.000 --> 19:24.241
and home to the largest
Navy of any landlocked country.

19:24.275 --> 19:26.379
[Emon] Are you gonna
show them the magic trick.

19:26.413 --> 19:27.907
[Jamiul] I'll show
them a thing or two.

19:27.931 --> 19:30.413
[Narrator] In the
suburb of lambare,

19:30.448 --> 19:32.896

19:32.931 --> 19:34.896
[emon] Pass me some cold...

19:34.931 --> 19:37.793
[Narrator] The boys
arrive at retirement home.

19:38.482 --> 19:39.689

19:41.172 --> 19:43.413
My name is emon.
Nice to meet you.

19:43.448 --> 19:46.758
- Nice to meet you.
- [Jamiul] Oh, you're from France.

19:46.793 --> 19:48.793
[Jamiul in French]

19:49.551 --> 19:50.793
- [Emon] Nice wine?
- Yes.

19:50.827 --> 19:53.379
- [Jamiul] Very nice wine.
- [All laugh]

19:55.241 --> 19:56.793

- Alice. Nice to meet you.

20:03.758 --> 20:05.413

tasked with keeping

20:05.448 --> 20:07.689
the residents
active and occupied,

20:07.724 --> 20:10.310
- they'll need to dig deeper.
- [Alice] Where? From where?

20:10.344 --> 20:12.724
- [Emon] England, Manchester. Yeah.
- Manchester?

20:12.758 --> 20:16.000
Wonder what are you
doing here in Paraguay.

20:16.034 --> 20:17.344
You are from Manchester.

20:17.379 --> 20:18.965
[Jamiul] We've come
to see you, yeah.

20:19.000 --> 20:21.310
- To say hello. [Chuckles]
- Of course, of course.

20:22.724 --> 20:25.068
I'll have a go. Two,
three, four, one.

20:25.103 --> 20:27.206
- [Man] I'm losing it.
- No, you're winning.

20:28.758 --> 20:29.793
[Jamiul] I can do magic.

20:30.448 --> 20:32.034
Ah!

20:32.068 --> 20:33.251
[Woman] You're
taking your cards?

20:33.275 --> 20:36.034
[Jamiul] Oh, my god. I
almost forgot to take my cards.

20:36.068 --> 20:37.586
What's the best trick?

20:37.620 --> 20:39.060
I got a lot of tricks,
you know that.

20:39.896 --> 20:42.068
Magic is worldwide,
everyone loves magic.

20:42.103 --> 20:43.896
[Jamiul] When you
approach a stranger

20:43.931 --> 20:46.965
and show 'em a quick magic
trick, they'll always be engaged

20:47.000 --> 20:48.241
into what you're saying.

20:48.275 --> 20:49.724
That's your card.

20:49.758 --> 20:51.137
- Yeah?
- No.

20:51.172 --> 20:53.000
- It is.
- I promise you that's not my card.

20:53.034 --> 20:54.241
- No?
- No.

20:54.275 --> 20:56.113
You're not going to get
very far with tricks like that.

20:56.137 --> 20:59.275
Sometimes I do struggle
with certain tricks.

20:59.310 --> 21:01.758
But at the end of the day,
practice makes perfect.

21:01.793 --> 21:04.241
I think I'm gonna have a lot
of time to brush up my skills.

21:04.275 --> 21:06.931
Pick any card. This one,
yeah? Okay, just take it.

21:06.965 --> 21:08.148
- Okay.
- Okay. I'm not gonna look at it,

21:08.172 --> 21:10.275
show it to everybody else.

21:10.310 --> 21:13.827
Yes, we're in the race. Well,
the law of living in this world

21:13.862 --> 21:14.976
is giving a little bit back.

21:15.000 --> 21:17.206
Ready? Okay.

21:17.241 --> 21:18.896
I would have said
you've gone for queen,

21:18.931 --> 21:20.310
but you didn't go for a queen.

21:20.344 --> 21:21.803
- [Woman 2] No.
- You went for a king.

21:21.827 --> 21:23.310
King of spades?

21:23.344 --> 21:24.965
- Yeah.
- King of spades.

21:25.000 --> 21:26.310
- Wow.
- [Emon chuckling]

21:28.310 --> 21:30.000
Who's going to show
me some dance moves?

21:30.034 --> 21:32.620
- [Elderly man] Do you dance?
- I like to dance.

21:32.655 --> 21:34.206
But the only
dance I know is this.

21:34.241 --> 21:35.965
[Music playing]

21:36.000 --> 21:37.517
That's the only dance I know.

21:37.551 --> 21:39.931
That's it. So you're gonna
have to teach me how to dance.

21:39.965 --> 21:41.551
Come and teach me some moves.

21:41.586 --> 21:44.275
- Why not?
- [Jamiul] Yes, come on, I'll help you up.

21:44.310 --> 21:46.551
- Come on.
- [Speaking indistinctly]

21:46.586 --> 21:49.793
One... two... What
else can you do?

21:50.551 --> 21:52.172
Oh, you're gonna do that to me?

21:52.206 --> 21:54.206
- Yes.
- I want to do it too.

21:54.241 --> 21:56.310
The lady Alice
and the French lady

21:56.344 --> 21:58.620
remind me of my
grandmas back home.

21:58.655 --> 22:00.275
One step backwards.

22:00.310 --> 22:02.862
There you... oh, yeah,
that one, and then forwards.

22:02.896 --> 22:04.448
- Forwards.
- And then back again.

22:04.482 --> 22:05.620
It must get lonely.

22:05.655 --> 22:07.827
And it must be
hard for these guys

22:07.862 --> 22:10.379
to be here alone
without their families.

22:10.413 --> 22:13.344
My grandmas, they at
least have their grandsons

22:13.379 --> 22:15.448
or their granddaughters
with them.

22:15.482 --> 22:18.413
If anything happens to them,
whole family would rush there.

22:18.448 --> 22:20.482
I'm not too sure how
it would happen here.

22:20.517 --> 22:22.586
[Emon] There you
go. Pizza for you.

22:22.620 --> 22:25.068
How do you say pizza in Spanish?

22:25.103 --> 22:27.310
-[Woman 2] Pizza -oh,
pizza, yeah. Pizza. Pizza.

22:27.344 --> 22:28.344
Pizza.

22:29.793 --> 22:32.137
You've traveled a lot
when you're a journalist, no?

22:32.172 --> 22:33.172
[Woman] Yeah, many, many.

22:33.206 --> 22:34.724
- All around Europe.
- Many, many.

22:34.758 --> 22:37.862
- Italy. Italy is so beautiful.
- Italy's nice, yeah.

22:37.896 --> 22:39.620
- You know Italy?
- Yes, I've been to Italy.

22:40.620 --> 22:42.413
Do you want a napkin?

22:42.448 --> 22:43.827
[Jamiul] Venice is beautiful.

22:43.862 --> 22:46.896
[Woman 3] Venice. I went
to venice, I was in love.

22:46.931 --> 22:48.103
You were in love in venice?

22:48.137 --> 22:49.137
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

22:50.413 --> 22:51.965
Finished with that?

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
My mum works in a nursing home.

22:54.034 --> 22:56.172
It was a chance for me
to put myself in her shoes.

22:56.206 --> 22:57.758
[Man] Easy come, easy go.

22:57.793 --> 22:59.034
Easy come, easy go.

22:59.068 --> 23:00.793
Try and put a
smile on their faces.

23:01.931 --> 23:04.103
Bedtime. Come here, my darling.

23:04.137 --> 23:05.551
[Kisses]

23:05.586 --> 23:06.620
Good night.

23:06.655 --> 23:08.551
Good night and good travelling.

23:08.586 --> 23:10.466
[Emon] Thank you very
much. Thank you very much.

23:18.896 --> 23:22.000
[Narrator] Back in Argentina
at corrientes bus station...

23:24.275 --> 23:27.206
After 16 days lagging
behind the other teams...

23:27.241 --> 23:28.241
[Sam] Hello.

23:29.137 --> 23:30.517
Oh, my god. What on...

23:32.551 --> 23:35.586
[Narrator] Dom and Lizzie have
caught up with rivals Jo and Sam.

23:35.620 --> 23:37.931
[Indistinct conversations]

23:39.827 --> 23:45.137
Both teams want to cross into Brazil
tonight, but they may have to wait.

23:45.172 --> 23:48.517
There's only one bus to Paso De
los libres and that's at one o'clock.

23:48.551 --> 23:50.620
[Lizzie] Is there seats?

23:50.655 --> 23:53.103
- So get in there...
- We've not got, erm...

23:53.827 --> 23:56.034
Oh, we've not got money, dom.

23:56.068 --> 23:58.241
Do you want me to go
to the cambio this time?

23:58.275 --> 24:00.551
- [Dom] No, I'll go.
- [Lizzie] I'll wait here.

24:02.310 --> 24:04.838
We need to start exchanging more
money, just to save me the hassle

24:04.862 --> 24:08.241
of doing these
trips to the cambios.

24:08.275 --> 24:10.620
It's always me that
has to go sort it out.

24:13.000 --> 24:15.793
[Narrator] With dom
off running an errand...

24:15.827 --> 24:18.551
[Lizzie] Jo, if we
wait for this bus,

24:18.586 --> 24:20.793
we're going to be another
seven hours behind.

24:20.827 --> 24:23.344
[Narrator] Lizzie steps forward
with a plan to speed things up.

24:23.379 --> 24:27.068
[Lizzie] We could go and see
if we could get a private taxi.

24:27.103 --> 24:28.448
[Jo] Yeah, we could.

24:28.482 --> 24:30.000
We split when we're together.

24:32.206 --> 24:33.275
That would work.

24:33.310 --> 24:34.631
If we're gonna get
same bus anyway.

24:34.655 --> 24:36.068
Yeah, exactly.

24:36.103 --> 24:37.943
- Should we go and have a look?
- [Lizzie] Yeah.

24:41.758 --> 24:43.517
[Jo] Oh, okay.

24:44.206 --> 24:46.655
[Lizzie] That's 8,162 pesos.

24:46.689 --> 24:48.310
So that would be
about 50 quid each.

24:48.344 --> 24:51.965
It's worth spending a bit more
money, I think, to catch up that time.

24:52.000 --> 24:54.103
It will arrive at the border

24:54.137 --> 24:56.000
before the bus here even leaves.

24:56.034 --> 24:58.241
And then we're in third
and fourth. We need it.

24:58.275 --> 24:59.793
That's our minivan over there.

25:00.482 --> 25:02.862
[Lizzie] Get our stuff on.

25:02.896 --> 25:06.068
Making a plan without dom's
approval is something I don't often do.

25:06.103 --> 25:09.068
And I know that dom doesn't like
doing things that cost a lot money.

25:09.689 --> 25:11.034
But I had the idea

25:11.068 --> 25:12.931
and I've got Jo and
Sam to back me up.

25:13.482 --> 25:15.068
He can't say no now.

25:16.344 --> 25:18.586
- Oh, dom.
- [Sam] Dom's coming now as well.

25:18.620 --> 25:19.517
[Lizzie] Dom's back,

25:19.551 --> 25:22.206
[chuckles] Um,
we've got minivan...

25:22.241 --> 25:24.241
- Yeah.
- Waiting for us now.

25:24.275 --> 25:27.344
- Okay.
- Yeah, it's 4,000 each.

25:28.448 --> 25:29.862
[Dom] Right. Okay.

25:29.896 --> 25:33.758
So I've got, like, 3,600.

25:33.793 --> 25:36.206
[Lizzie] The plan we've
come up with isn't cheap.

25:36.241 --> 25:39.103
But I've wanted to in this
race, make more decisions.

25:39.137 --> 25:41.275
So I'm quite happy
that I've done this,

25:41.310 --> 25:44.241
- and whether he likes it or not, we're going.
- I'll cover you.

25:44.275 --> 25:46.275
[Lizzie] And we can get
more money at the border.

25:46.310 --> 25:47.862
- Okay.
- All right.

25:47.896 --> 25:49.344
- Should we get it going?
- Let's go.

25:51.172 --> 25:54.068
I just hope that he's not in a
grump for the rest of the journey.

25:54.103 --> 25:56.689
To be fair, when
I was at the bank,

25:56.724 --> 25:59.931
I was thinking "has Lizzie
just ran off with Jo and Sam?"

25:59.965 --> 26:02.034
The amount she's been
talking about you two,

26:02.068 --> 26:03.931
I was thinking she
might just ditch me.

26:05.413 --> 26:09.827
- No.
- [Lizzie] I would never swap my brother for the world.

26:09.862 --> 26:13.068
- Well, guys, cheers to Brazil.
- Cheers to Brazil.

26:13.103 --> 26:14.275
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

26:14.310 --> 26:16.862
[Narrator] As two teams
joined forces to reach Brazil,

26:16.896 --> 26:19.103
373 kilometers away...

26:19.137 --> 26:21.689
What's Portuguese for cheers?

26:23.586 --> 26:26.344
I'm not happy about
the new language.

26:26.379 --> 26:29.172
I'm going to get
ever so confused.

26:29.206 --> 26:31.586
[Narrator] Jen and Rob are
the first team to get there.

26:32.241 --> 26:34.310
Portuguese?

26:34.344 --> 26:36.551
Is that... I don't
want to say it.

26:36.586 --> 26:38.241
Where do they speak
Portuguese? In...

26:38.275 --> 26:40.389
- Portugal.
- That's what I was gonna say but I felt too stupid.

26:40.413 --> 26:41.965
[Rob laughs]

26:43.344 --> 26:45.517
[Jen] So is this like
Niagara Falls then?

26:45.551 --> 26:48.689
- [Rob] I that think niagara is not as wide.
- [Jen] Really?

26:50.965 --> 26:52.275
[Rob] Can you see up there?

26:52.310 --> 26:54.344
[Jen] Oh, look at that.

26:54.379 --> 26:55.689
Iguazu falls.

27:00.068 --> 27:02.931
[Narrator] Straddling
the border with Argentina,

27:02.965 --> 27:07.000
iguazu, a chain of
nearly 300 waterfalls.

27:09.137 --> 27:12.172
The most dramatic is
known as the devil's throat...

27:13.413 --> 27:15.275
Formed according to folklore,

27:15.310 --> 27:18.413
by an angry god,
spurned by a local girl.

27:19.965 --> 27:21.655
- [Rob] Look at that.
- [Jen] Oh, wow.

27:22.655 --> 27:24.448
Oh, my god.

27:24.482 --> 27:28.068
That is possibly the best view
that I've ever seen in my life.

27:29.724 --> 27:31.344
[Rob] Better than
seeing me naked?

27:31.379 --> 27:33.275
[Jen] Way better.
Like 100 times better.

27:34.551 --> 27:37.586
And just like, with
the mist coming off it,

27:37.620 --> 27:40.241
it just... you can see
its power and strength.

27:45.827 --> 27:48.507
I've actually never seen anything
like this in my life forever. Ever.

27:52.275 --> 27:55.379
You just forget, don't you?
Like, because of the race,

27:55.413 --> 27:59.103
you just forget to stop and
look around at where you are.

28:00.758 --> 28:03.000
Imagine that we just
passed through Brazil.

28:03.034 --> 28:06.620
Yeah, we've been to Brazil, but
have you actually seen Brazil?

28:06.655 --> 28:08.931
This is nice, we're
actually stopping to see it.

28:09.586 --> 28:10.827
Just take it in.

28:19.896 --> 28:23.482
When we first met, I mean,
we would attend parties.

28:23.517 --> 28:27.862
We'd got out to dinner, we'd go to
the theater, you know, go to the cinema.

28:27.896 --> 28:31.655
And that's just not really a fun
environment for him anymore.

28:31.689 --> 28:34.931
We should absolutely put radiance
here and make it into a pool.

28:34.965 --> 28:37.689
What we do for fun now is
really dramatically changed.

28:37.724 --> 28:42.137
We've probably now just have, you know,
the TV on the background with subtitles.

28:42.172 --> 28:44.586
We probably play like a
board game or something.

28:46.137 --> 28:48.551
We've just taken
this little bit of a stop

28:48.586 --> 28:50.482
just to work out
how we'd be together

28:50.517 --> 28:53.241
and how things have
changed and how to go forward.

28:54.448 --> 28:56.655
We just hit play and
we'll be off again.

28:57.724 --> 29:00.482
- [Monkeys chattering]
- Robbie, get me a banana.

29:01.517 --> 29:03.182
[Rob] Probably nicked
more than your banana.

29:03.206 --> 29:04.689
I don't have
anything for it to take.

29:04.724 --> 29:07.586
[Monkeys chattering]

29:09.034 --> 29:12.448
[Speaking foreign language]

29:13.689 --> 29:16.103
[Narrator] Buoyed by
the iguazu adventure,

29:16.137 --> 29:18.965
Jen and Rob are planning
some more sightseeing.

29:19.000 --> 29:21.000
Can't believe we're
going to Blumenau.

29:21.827 --> 29:22.896
I really can't.

29:23.724 --> 29:25.310
Really can't.

29:25.344 --> 29:27.586
Jen, I'm really excited.

29:27.620 --> 29:30.482
[Narrator] With a detour
to the town of Blumenau,

29:30.517 --> 29:33.965
founded in 1852 by
germanic immigrants.

29:34.000 --> 29:36.448
My dad's half German. [In
German accent] That is good.

29:37.413 --> 29:39.655
[Jen] Have some
beer, have a sausage.

29:40.655 --> 29:42.758
- Brazil.
- Brazil.

29:42.793 --> 29:46.206
[Narrator] Newly arrived
in Brazil, emon and jamiul.

29:46.241 --> 29:48.896
Sao Paulo. Discount.

29:49.620 --> 29:51.551
No money, try, try.

29:51.586 --> 29:52.724
Magic, magic.

29:52.758 --> 29:55.000
[Narrator] On
route to Sao Paulo.

29:56.137 --> 29:57.448
No chance?

29:57.482 --> 29:59.862
Okay, here, 220.

30:00.379 --> 30:01.965
Wow. Wow. Wow.

30:02.000 --> 30:04.838
Just a case of getting out of Brazil
with as much money intact as we can.

30:04.862 --> 30:07.931
All right, let's get ready
for an 18 hour journey.

30:10.344 --> 30:12.551
[Speaking in Spanish]

30:12.586 --> 30:15.000
- [Narrator] At the border...
- Bye, Argentina.

30:15.034 --> 30:17.034
[Jo] Hello, Brazil.

30:17.068 --> 30:19.068
[Narrator] For Jo,
Sam, dom and Lizzie,

30:19.103 --> 30:21.896
their marriage of traveling
convenience is at an end.

30:21.931 --> 30:23.724
We'll see you at the checkpoint.

30:23.758 --> 30:26.724
Make sure you
enjoy Brazil, guys.

30:26.758 --> 30:32.413
[Narrator] But both teams are heading in
the same direction, to the Atlantic coast.

30:32.448 --> 30:36.310
Mother and son, lured by the
surf from the promise of work.

30:36.344 --> 30:38.931
- We're in Brazil.
- [Jo] Whoo!

30:38.965 --> 30:40.206
Florianopolis today?

30:40.241 --> 30:42.310
That's a $100 each.

30:42.344 --> 30:46.724
While the siblings aimed to continue
along the coastal superhighway north.

30:46.758 --> 30:49.620
How do you say "how
long" in Portuguese?

30:49.655 --> 30:51.827
Just about learning Spanish.

30:51.862 --> 30:53.793
[Lizzie] Now we're
in a different country.

30:53.827 --> 30:56.482
[Speaking foreign language]

30:56.517 --> 30:59.241
- [Cashier] Takes about 24 hours.
- 24 hours.

30:59.275 --> 31:02.448
- [Exclaims]
- Oh, Christ.

31:02.482 --> 31:04.379
- Does that break our record?
- Yeah, it does.

31:06.793 --> 31:10.379
I'm quite smug that we've
already caught up with Jo and Sam.

31:10.413 --> 31:12.310
Obviously, it is
not great for them

31:12.344 --> 31:16.827
that they've lost their
lead on us, but I don't care.

31:23.172 --> 31:24.172
[Emon] Brazil.

31:25.172 --> 31:27.413
Wow, Sao Paulo.

31:27.448 --> 31:28.482
Wow.

31:32.379 --> 31:35.137
[Narrator] Home to over
twenty one million people,

31:35.172 --> 31:38.551
Sao Paulo is the fourth
largest city in the world.

31:40.379 --> 31:44.758
A melting pot of African, European,
Japanese and arab cultures.

31:47.620 --> 31:52.517
Presenting emon and jamiul with
an opportunity too good to miss.

31:52.551 --> 31:54.413
Let's get to the
hostel, get checked in,

31:54.448 --> 31:57.931
freshen up and...
[Indiscernible]

31:59.655 --> 32:00.931
Since we've been on the travels

32:00.965 --> 32:03.010
we've not been able to do or
find a praying congregation,

32:03.034 --> 32:04.655
even in Panama.

32:04.689 --> 32:06.827
The Friday prayer
is very important.

32:06.862 --> 32:11.862
It's one time in the week that every Muslim
should give a little time to do prayers.

32:12.620 --> 32:14.965
[Praying in native language]

32:20.068 --> 32:23.275
[Narrator] In the city center,
the country's oldest mosque,

32:23.310 --> 32:27.965
mesquita Brazil,
founded in 1929.

32:31.793 --> 32:35.517
Helping to serve the largest
Muslim community in Latin America.

32:39.000 --> 32:41.206
Take a bit of time out
in the race to do this,

32:41.241 --> 32:42.758
I just feel at peace right now.

32:42.793 --> 32:45.965
I just feel peaceful.
I just feel happy.

32:46.000 --> 32:48.724
I think it was almost destiny
that we come here on a Friday.

32:48.758 --> 32:50.551
So it's the universe
speaking to us.

32:50.586 --> 32:52.689
[Speaking foreign
language] Emon.

32:52.724 --> 32:55.896
On our trip, we've been
through a lot of countries.

32:55.931 --> 32:59.241
This is the first Friday
prayer we've done five weeks.

32:59.275 --> 33:03.103
- To the first masjid we found in South America.
- Oh.

33:03.137 --> 33:04.596
That's why we really
wanted to come here.

33:04.620 --> 33:09.068
Sao Paulo, you can find lot of
mosques. Several mosques here.

33:09.103 --> 33:12.344
It's mad how we're sat
on a table with Moroccans,

33:12.379 --> 33:15.137
Libyans, Afghans, brits.

33:15.172 --> 33:17.275
It just shows how
multicultural the space is.

33:17.310 --> 33:20.172
We actually genuinely
haven't met many muslims.

33:20.206 --> 33:22.586
It's just good. It makes
you feel welcomed,

33:22.620 --> 33:25.103
you guys have welcomed
us very nicely, thank you.

33:25.137 --> 33:27.413
- Mohammed's got my Facebook, yeah?
- Mohammed... okay.

33:27.448 --> 33:31.275
Community and family are two
things that are very important in my life,

33:31.310 --> 33:34.413
and I found community here.

33:34.448 --> 33:36.137
[Indistinct conversation]

33:36.172 --> 33:37.572
- I'm full, I'm full.
- I'm so full.

33:45.793 --> 33:48.620
[Narrator] After an 18
hour journey cross country,

33:48.655 --> 33:53.931
Jo and Sam have reached
Praia do Rosa, the Rosie beach,

33:53.965 --> 33:57.068
surrounded by tropical
jungle and forested mountains,

33:57.103 --> 33:59.620
it has seven kilometers
of golden sand

33:59.655 --> 34:02.137
and the perfect
break for surfing.

34:04.620 --> 34:07.068
- Hi, I'm Sam.
- Hello, nice to meet you.

34:07.103 --> 34:08.827
- [Man] This is Luna.
- [Sam] Hello, Luna.

34:08.862 --> 34:11.689
Hi, Jo, this is my wife Ivana.

34:11.724 --> 34:14.206
Seven years ago,
British expat Sean

34:14.241 --> 34:18.413
moved here with his Brazilian
wife, Ivana and their two children.

34:18.448 --> 34:20.793
- Oh, my god.
- [Jo] Oh, wow.

34:20.827 --> 34:23.482
[Narrator] And set about
building their dream home.

34:24.655 --> 34:26.586
This is incredible.

34:26.620 --> 34:29.862
[Narrator] Cash strapped mother
and son are hoping to end their keep.

34:29.896 --> 34:32.034
We've got a real problem
in the back of the house.

34:32.068 --> 34:33.182
You're going to
have a look for us.

34:33.206 --> 34:35.006
If you can help me,
it'd would be really cool.

34:35.034 --> 34:37.551
I've got five cubic
meters of earth to move.

34:37.586 --> 34:39.862
Back at home, I do
landscape gardening.

34:39.896 --> 34:42.413
Quite often we use a
digger and a dumper.

34:42.448 --> 34:44.655
But quite often we use
a shovel and hand, so...

34:44.689 --> 34:46.275
It's a shovel and hand.

34:46.310 --> 34:47.724
How about, if we have a deal?

34:47.758 --> 34:51.551
If I get you surfing, get you up
and riding, you help me with this.

34:51.586 --> 34:53.103
You got a deal.

34:53.137 --> 34:55.310
[Sean] Perfect. Perfect.
Come on, let's go.

34:58.034 --> 34:59.758
[Laughing]

35:01.551 --> 35:05.931
Right there, is literally, my
dream of a dream house.

35:05.965 --> 35:08.137
We're really lucky,
man. And living here,

35:08.172 --> 35:11.758
has taught us a really
different way to look at life.

35:11.793 --> 35:14.724
I'd say we need
$400 a month to live.

35:14.758 --> 35:17.275
-And that's for food... Everything?
-Yeah.

35:17.310 --> 35:18.758
I don't have the latest iPhone.

35:18.793 --> 35:22.413
I don't have a new car, but I'm the
happiest I've ever been in my life.

35:22.448 --> 35:25.137
Back at home, I think I'm
pretty privileged personally,

35:25.172 --> 35:29.379
but coming on this has got to make
you realize, appreciate what you have.

35:29.413 --> 35:32.793
They call it here
gratidao. It is gratitude.

35:32.827 --> 35:35.862
Which I think really is
missing from western culture.

35:35.896 --> 35:38.241
- Of all things.
- 100%.

35:38.275 --> 35:41.586
- People don't appreciate what they've got.
- No way.

35:41.620 --> 35:43.310
- [Laughing]
- Yes.

35:44.689 --> 35:47.000
- Little miss sunshine.
- Little miss Princess.

35:47.034 --> 35:49.448
- [Laughing]
- Suits you.

35:54.827 --> 35:57.137
[Narrator] 90
kilometers to the north...

35:57.172 --> 35:58.586
Sick of the rain.

35:58.620 --> 36:00.068
Oh!

36:01.931 --> 36:05.172
Dom and Lizzie are looking
to overnight in florianopolis.

36:05.206 --> 36:09.655
- Leeds, that way.
- And that's where we're getting breakfast.

36:09.689 --> 36:13.689
[Narrator] Regarded by many as
the party destination for backpackers.

36:14.275 --> 36:17.241
Oh, hello.

36:17.275 --> 36:19.172
- [Woman] Do you have a reservation?
- No.

36:19.206 --> 36:21.689
Okay, do you want a
private or shared room?

36:21.724 --> 36:23.010
- [Dom] Shared room.
- Shared, yeah.

36:23.034 --> 36:27.275
I have one bedroom with
six beds. That's okay for you?

36:27.310 --> 36:28.517
- Yeah.
- Okay.

36:29.827 --> 36:34.068
Little bit awkward, I just
don't want to wake anyone up.

36:34.103 --> 36:37.551
[Narrator] But with only 21%
of their budget remaining...

36:37.586 --> 36:41.655
[Speaking foreign language]

36:41.689 --> 36:43.689
it's a quiet night in.

36:43.724 --> 36:45.389
[Dom] I've just been
thinking about the race,

36:45.413 --> 36:48.068
and I'm like, as these
latter stages ensue,

36:48.103 --> 36:51.344
and I'm going to become
more and more competitive.

36:51.379 --> 36:54.896
And I know we both get on
with Sam and Jo really well.

36:54.931 --> 36:57.448
But I feel like you have
this loyalty towards them.

36:57.482 --> 37:00.068
I don't know, I know you
probably won't like to hear this,

37:00.103 --> 37:03.103
but when me and Jo were
making decision about the minibus,

37:03.137 --> 37:05.965
and we were running around
and Jo was so encouraging.

37:06.000 --> 37:08.551
And I responded way better
to that, and I went and did it.

37:08.586 --> 37:10.413
I kind of need a positivity.

37:10.448 --> 37:11.872
Whereas, I think,
sometimes with you,

37:11.896 --> 37:13.416
I feel like you're
really discouraging.

37:14.275 --> 37:15.482
Okay.

37:17.862 --> 37:19.758
We'll just try to do
things as a team.

37:19.793 --> 37:23.068
And I'll say... I'll try to
be more encouraging.

37:23.103 --> 37:26.758
- Yeah.
- I think what I struggle with is vulnerability,

37:26.793 --> 37:30.310
because on the outside,
I've always been confident.

37:30.344 --> 37:34.689
I was always okay
off until university,

37:34.724 --> 37:37.896
and then, like, just when I
wasn't achieving as much

37:37.931 --> 37:39.827
as I thought I was
going to achieve

37:39.862 --> 37:42.620
and there was a lot of
pressure. And I've struggled.

37:43.862 --> 37:45.827
By not talking to
anyone about it,

37:45.862 --> 37:49.896
I sort of dug myself into a hole
and bottled up all these emotions

37:49.931 --> 37:55.241
that eventually led to me
dropping out of university and...

37:55.275 --> 37:58.206
I'm really not sure what's
going on in my life right now.

37:58.241 --> 38:01.551
Maybe you can learn
something from my open emotion

38:01.586 --> 38:03.758
because you don't
communicate. That's your problem.

38:03.793 --> 38:05.896
And that... aha, now
you've picked out my flaws.

38:05.931 --> 38:07.793
You need to communicate better.

38:08.482 --> 38:09.965
I'm just not very good at it.

38:10.000 --> 38:13.310
But try harder, because I think it'll
make a whole world of difference.

38:13.344 --> 38:16.517
[Dom] I think I really could
use some of Lizzie's grants,

38:16.551 --> 38:18.689
some of her wisdom in life,

38:18.724 --> 38:23.137
and I don't think I actually
listen to her all the time

38:23.172 --> 38:24.517
when I really should.

38:24.551 --> 38:28.620
That was probably the most
open conversation we've hard,

38:28.655 --> 38:31.310
- probably since we were six.
- Yeah.

38:31.344 --> 38:33.137
I feel like it's been
a long time coming.

38:33.172 --> 38:36.482
[Narrator] Just 215
kilometers to the north...

38:37.655 --> 38:39.896
- [Jen] Let's be German.
- [Rob] How do you be German?

38:39.931 --> 38:41.551
[Jen] Go for a beer.

38:43.482 --> 38:47.827
[Narrator] Jen and Rob have arrived
in the Brazilian beer capital, Blumenau.

38:47.862 --> 38:52.793
That claims to host the largest beer
festival in the world outside of Germany.

38:52.827 --> 38:55.620
Attracting around a
million revelers each year.

38:57.344 --> 39:01.137
I guess that is what I expected,
but still it is a bit strange.

39:02.862 --> 39:05.620
Everyone is wearing lederhosen.

39:05.655 --> 39:09.379
And it's in the middle of Brazil.
It just feels... It feels weird.

39:11.275 --> 39:12.562
[Jen] I know the
race is so important,

39:12.586 --> 39:15.000
I really want to continue
having a lot of fun.

39:15.034 --> 39:16.551
Do more things like this.

39:16.586 --> 39:18.068
There's only two legs left,

39:18.103 --> 39:19.286
and I don't want to waste them.

39:19.310 --> 39:21.148
Like, I absolutely want
to just make the most of it,

39:21.172 --> 39:23.310
have a really pretty
bloody great time.

39:23.344 --> 39:24.931
I've decided that's
what we're gonna do.

39:42.965 --> 39:45.310
[Singing in foreign language]

39:56.896 --> 40:00.586
I can honestly say now I've
had nice... Really nice time.

40:04.137 --> 40:05.206
I know it's baby steps.

40:05.241 --> 40:08.655
But I almost wish I knew
how to kind of build on it,

40:08.689 --> 40:12.310
and how to carry on
that when we get home,

40:12.344 --> 40:15.310
I'm scared that we're just gonna
go back to, like, our normal routine.

40:15.344 --> 40:19.793
I don't want to. 'Cause I can
see now, how life limiting that is.

40:19.827 --> 40:21.689
I really want to be
able to kind of go home

40:21.724 --> 40:25.137
and make changes and
continue to make changes.

40:25.172 --> 40:28.379
Let's make sure we go home with
real memories and real experiences

40:28.413 --> 40:29.758
rather than regrets.

40:31.551 --> 40:33.241
Well, there you are.

40:33.275 --> 40:36.620
[Indistinct conversations]

40:38.482 --> 40:40.034
Slightly scary!

40:40.068 --> 40:41.655
[Laughing]

40:43.000 --> 40:45.862
Brilliant, I want
one of this at home.

40:48.413 --> 40:52.413
[Woman] Whoa. There we go.

40:52.448 --> 40:55.793
It's so lovely of you to have
us here. It's was an experience.

40:55.827 --> 40:56.724
Thank you.

40:56.758 --> 40:57.758
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

40:57.793 --> 40:59.896
So nice to have you guys around.

40:59.931 --> 41:01.931
And he did amazing job.

41:01.965 --> 41:03.862
- Well done, Sam.
- [Sam] Cheers.

41:03.896 --> 41:05.251
- [Ivana] Cheers.
- [Sean] Cheers, guys.

41:05.275 --> 41:06.955
- [Jo] Cheers to life.
- [Ivana] Well done.

41:08.241 --> 41:11.620
So what made you make the
move from Brighton to Brazil?

41:11.655 --> 41:15.896
We kind of thought about it as a
dream, you know, maybe one day.

41:15.931 --> 41:19.275
And then in two 2012,
I had a heart attack

41:19.310 --> 41:21.275
- 'cause of stress.
- Oh, my goodness.

41:21.310 --> 41:25.689
And then, unfortunately, Ivana
got thyroid cancer at the same time.

41:25.724 --> 41:28.586
- Oh, my goodness.
- So we were, like, both of it.

41:28.620 --> 41:31.931
[Jo] And you're in the clear
everything with your thyroid?

41:31.965 --> 41:34.896
- Yes, thank god for that.
- [Sean] There's more to life, you know.

41:34.931 --> 41:36.631
- Just follow our dreams.
- Just do it, yeah.

41:36.655 --> 41:38.044
You know, just do
it. Let's get out here.

41:38.068 --> 41:40.379
Yeah. We actually
started this race, really,

41:40.413 --> 41:42.931
just for the adventure
and fun of it.

41:42.965 --> 41:44.838
But, actually, it's become
so much more, I think.

41:44.862 --> 41:46.413
- Gypsum.
- Yeah.

41:46.448 --> 41:50.103
You know, you just
look at life differently.

41:50.137 --> 41:52.068
[Sean] And you can
do it. You change it.

41:52.103 --> 41:53.700
- [Ivana] You can change it.
- [Jo] Yeah.

41:53.724 --> 41:56.034
[Ivana] It wasn't easy,
life is not. But, you know...

41:56.068 --> 41:58.286
- I think health does do that, doesn't it?
- [Ivana] Yeah.

41:58.310 --> 42:01.482
-You just suddenly go... Reevaluate.
-[Ivana] Exactly.

42:13.689 --> 42:16.344
[Sam] This whole
time I'm travelling,

42:16.379 --> 42:18.827
I've been dying for
the beach, dying to surf.

42:18.862 --> 42:21.172
It's an amazing place,
you're gonna love it.

42:23.517 --> 42:26.448
I've gotten speechless.
It's just... I'm ready.

42:26.482 --> 42:28.068
- Yeah? Let's go.
- Let's go.

42:28.103 --> 42:29.793
[Laughter]

42:32.137 --> 42:33.657
[Sean] So, you're
paddling to the wave,

42:33.689 --> 42:36.113
you even say to yourself, "back
foot, front foot. Back foot, front foot."

42:36.137 --> 42:39.586
So, you just go, "back
foot, front foot." That's it.

42:39.620 --> 42:42.137
[Sam] Yeah, show me that
when we're out there as well.

42:44.827 --> 42:46.551
Don't watch me
getting changed, mum.

42:46.586 --> 42:48.626
[Jo] I'm not watching you.
I'm looking at the waves.

42:49.793 --> 42:50.862
[Ivana] Good luck, guys.

42:50.896 --> 42:52.551
Have fun.

42:55.827 --> 42:58.068
- He's gonna enjoy this.
- Yeah, I think he is.

42:59.068 --> 43:00.689
I think he's gonna love it.

43:07.310 --> 43:10.344
[Jo] I didn't really expect
the race to be enlightening.

43:10.379 --> 43:11.862
But it has.

43:11.896 --> 43:14.389
You know, it's just... You look at
the ocean and watching Sam surf,

43:14.413 --> 43:18.379
um, on one of the ten most
beautiful beaches in the world.

43:18.413 --> 43:22.827
It frees you up to think about
why we're doing this trip and...

43:24.655 --> 43:26.620
See... see the bigger picture.

43:30.000 --> 43:32.689
The last few years, I've
had a few health issues.

43:32.724 --> 43:35.275
I was diagnosed with lymphoma,

43:35.310 --> 43:38.310
which is a cancer of
the lymphatic system,

43:38.344 --> 43:40.379
um, back in 2011.

43:40.413 --> 43:43.206
And then it came back
about four years later.

43:43.241 --> 43:46.172
And then I had chemo, um...

43:47.586 --> 43:51.931
Which... it was harder
than I thought it would be.

43:51.965 --> 43:54.034
I lost 80% of my hair.

43:54.068 --> 43:55.551
And I put on weight

43:55.586 --> 43:57.827
and I lost a lot of confidence.

43:57.862 --> 44:01.068
I tried to sort of put
a brave face on it,

44:01.103 --> 44:06.482
but, um, I think I
was maybe a bit naive

44:06.517 --> 44:09.896
about dealing with things.

44:09.931 --> 44:13.137
It's not curable.
It will come back.

44:13.172 --> 44:16.551
So I know that I've
got a limited period,

44:16.586 --> 44:18.310
really, that I can do this.

44:20.275 --> 44:23.172
This made me kind
of reevaluate life now.

44:23.206 --> 44:26.379
I really want to do
something again.

44:26.413 --> 44:31.000
I want to travel again. I want
to, um, see the world again.

44:31.034 --> 44:33.620
And also introduce Sam to it.

44:33.655 --> 44:37.034
Um, I think spending
time with locals

44:37.068 --> 44:40.689
and doing amazing
things in amazing places,

44:40.724 --> 44:44.482
um, he really seems
to be embracing it.

44:44.517 --> 44:48.862
And for me, that's the
biggest gift, um, I could get.

44:48.896 --> 44:52.517
You know, just seeing
him... Seeing him loving it

44:52.551 --> 44:55.827
and discovering world, you know,

44:55.862 --> 44:59.103
we've got memories
to last us forever.

45:09.758 --> 45:11.896
[Narrator] In Sao Paulo...

45:11.931 --> 45:14.068
[Jamiul] One room,
45 for the hostel.

45:14.103 --> 45:15.965
- [Emon] Other than food.
- Eighteen for taxi.

45:16.000 --> 45:18.172
- [Emon] Taxis.
- [Narrator] A money count.

45:18.206 --> 45:21.206
[Jamiul] We spent £2,354.

45:21.241 --> 45:23.068
What the bloody hell, man?

45:23.965 --> 45:25.344
That's a lot of money.

45:25.379 --> 45:27.310
Yeah, I think Brazil's
taking its toll on us.

45:27.344 --> 45:30.241
All the other teams, I think,
would've got hit in Brazil as well.

45:31.241 --> 45:34.448
Two, four, six, eight, ten.

45:34.482 --> 45:35.965
Actually a lot
less than I thought.

45:36.000 --> 45:38.862
We've way overspent.

45:38.896 --> 45:42.586
[Narrator] The sixth leg is
beginning to take its toll on all teams.

45:43.379 --> 45:44.896
And every day spent in Brazil

45:44.931 --> 45:48.689
is costing them close to
10% of the remaining budgets.

45:48.724 --> 45:49.931
It's gonna be tight.

45:49.965 --> 45:52.724
- We need to make sure that we...
- get out of Sao Paulo,

45:52.758 --> 45:55.103
[emon] With as much
money as we can.

45:56.344 --> 46:00.689
Being second to be
the first of the ones.

46:00.724 --> 46:03.862
- We lose.
- There's no point to be going second.

46:04.310 --> 46:05.862
[Chuckles]

46:05.896 --> 46:08.044
- [Narrator] En route to the bus station.
- [Emon] Bit of coconut juice.

46:08.068 --> 46:09.620
Six reals for a coconut.

46:31.137 --> 46:32.448
It shouldn't be like this, man.

46:33.758 --> 46:35.137
It should not be like this.

46:44.000 --> 46:48.034
[Indistinct chatter]

46:51.517 --> 46:53.827
Let's give what I
can to them kids.

46:53.862 --> 46:55.103
What I've seen is just...

46:56.172 --> 46:57.517
It's just killing me inside.

47:01.344 --> 47:02.896
Anything else?

47:02.931 --> 47:04.793
If I wasn't on a
race with jamiul,

47:04.827 --> 47:07.689
this was my
money, I'll give it all.

47:07.724 --> 47:11.517
Then I go to the closest bank
and take as much as out I can.

47:11.551 --> 47:14.275
Surely, that must be
worth a Bob or two.

47:15.482 --> 47:17.034
Where... where is jam?

47:20.137 --> 47:21.537
[Jamiul] I've seen
the whole family.

47:22.896 --> 47:24.034
I just...

47:28.551 --> 47:32.586
I just can't, for the
life of me, understand.

47:35.034 --> 47:37.551
Cards always makes people happy.

47:37.586 --> 47:40.448
He did better than I did.

47:40.482 --> 47:43.275
I'd say he's strong enough, man.

47:43.310 --> 47:44.655
He can keep himself together.

47:46.310 --> 47:47.310
Water bottle.

47:51.275 --> 47:53.482
[Indistinct]

47:53.517 --> 47:56.758
First thing that I noticed when I
went there, there was no shoes.

47:56.793 --> 48:00.724
Seen some little feet poking
out the blanket at the bottom.

48:00.758 --> 48:03.620
And they were like, you
know, black as anything.

48:03.655 --> 48:07.000
So I just did what any
human being should do, really.

48:09.758 --> 48:10.827
Who wants sweets?

48:11.896 --> 48:12.965
Okay?

48:26.827 --> 48:29.241
[Indistinct chatter]

48:40.000 --> 48:41.896
- [Man] Hundred and six.
- [Emon] Yeah. Okay.

48:41.931 --> 48:43.448
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

48:48.034 --> 48:49.148
So, we're leaving for Sao Paulo.

48:49.172 --> 48:51.206
At least we're heading
to checkpoint now.

48:54.689 --> 48:56.275
[Narrator] To
get to ilha grande,

48:56.310 --> 49:00.172
emon and jamiul need to catch a
boat from the port of angra dos reis.

49:01.758 --> 49:03.793
No boats operate after dark.

49:04.517 --> 49:06.103
So the boys have eight hours

49:06.137 --> 49:10.965
to cover 400 kilometers to
set sail for the island tonight.

49:11.000 --> 49:14.103
It's just one little
boat to get on, that's it.

49:14.137 --> 49:16.310
Let's have a real
think about this.

49:16.344 --> 49:17.551
[Narrator] In Blumenau,

49:17.586 --> 49:20.965
Jen and Rob also have
their sights set on ilha grande.

49:21.551 --> 49:23.000
[Jen] What about rio?

49:23.034 --> 49:24.586
Rio de Janeiro?

49:24.620 --> 49:28.103
[Narrator] However, they've
opted for a more circuitous route.

49:28.137 --> 49:32.482
Leap frogging Sao
Paulo to arrive in rio.

49:32.517 --> 49:34.655
Then, doubling back
to a different port,

49:34.689 --> 49:36.793
conceicao De jacarei.

49:36.827 --> 49:39.482
And from there, catch
a boat to the checkpoint.

49:39.517 --> 49:42.551
[Jen] This is good. I'm happy.
We've got to get a move on.

49:42.586 --> 49:44.320
- Thank you so much.
- [Ivana] We'll be in touch.

49:44.344 --> 49:46.586
[Narrator] Also
back on the road...

49:46.620 --> 49:49.068
- [Sam] See you later.
- [Narrator] ...Jo and Sam...

49:49.103 --> 49:51.034
[Jo] The race is back on.

49:51.068 --> 49:52.620
[Narrator] ...And
dom and Lizzie...

49:54.206 --> 49:56.758
Both aiming for Sao Paulo.

49:56.793 --> 50:00.137
[Dom] I reckon we've
got 30 quid to spend a day.

50:00.172 --> 50:01.620
How are we gonna do that?

50:01.655 --> 50:04.310
[Lizzie] Dom, it's fine.
We can't change it.

50:06.068 --> 50:08.344
- [Emon] What time is it?
- About afternoon.

50:08.379 --> 50:09.793
Afternoon?

50:09.827 --> 50:14.620
Hope we get at this boat
today, man. It's dark already.

50:14.655 --> 50:16.375
[Emon] Pitch black.
Ain't happening tonight.

50:21.034 --> 50:25.827
[Narrator] Arriving at angra
dos reis the bay of kings,

50:25.862 --> 50:30.758
emon and jamiul failed to catch
the last boat of the day to ilha grande.

50:30.793 --> 50:33.000
[Emon] Let's find
some accommodation

50:33.034 --> 50:34.551
and try again in
the morning for boat.

50:34.586 --> 50:37.137
[Narrator] And are forced
to wait for the next boat,

50:37.172 --> 50:39.068
leaving at eight

50:40.482 --> 50:42.000
Closing in on rio,

50:42.034 --> 50:44.448
Jen and Rob on
their overnight bus.

50:50.620 --> 50:52.551
Do you know a boat terminal?

50:53.379 --> 50:55.034
Boat? Ilha grande?

50:55.827 --> 50:59.379
This. Ilha grande?

50:59.413 --> 51:00.931
[Emon] It's got
to be here sooner.

51:02.862 --> 51:04.622
[Narrator] Thirty
kilometers along the coast.

51:05.793 --> 51:07.379
- [Man] Hello.

51:17.551 --> 51:20.275

where do we get this boat from?

51:20.310 --> 51:21.689
[Man] Just walk around.

51:21.724 --> 51:26.000
- [Emon] These are some god statues, eh?
- You got the three wise men.

51:26.034 --> 51:29.448
Is it the three wise men
or is three something else?

51:29.482 --> 51:31.965
Oh, it might be right in
the back. Can you see?

51:32.000 --> 51:33.896
[Emon] I don't think it's that.

51:35.000 --> 51:37.448
[Rob] I think I
can see the pier.

51:37.482 --> 51:39.586
[Jon] Oh, is that where
we're going, to the jetty?

51:40.586 --> 51:42.551
Thank you very much.

51:44.172 --> 51:45.068

54:03.482 --> 54:04.803
[Emon] I fancy a walk
through the jungle.

54:04.827 --> 54:07.344
[Narrator] A two-kilometer
trek through the rainforest...

54:07.379 --> 54:08.586
[Emon] A jungle trek.

54:09.482 --> 54:10.482
This is cool.

54:11.931 --> 54:13.827
[Narrator] Or a
canoe across the bay.

54:14.827 --> 54:17.000
I'm just trying to
save my trousers. Oh.

54:17.034 --> 54:18.665
Yeah, don't pull it
over. Don't pull over.

54:18.689 --> 54:21.931
Yeah, but I've never canoed
before. Give me a minute.

54:21.965 --> 54:24.793
We'll see one of other teams
when a canoe passes in a minute.

54:24.827 --> 54:26.241
[Jen] Am I doing it right?

54:26.275 --> 54:27.424
[Rob] Yeah, you're
doing perfect.

54:27.448 --> 54:29.482
[Laughs] I'm canoeing!

54:29.517 --> 54:31.068
- [Rob laughs]
- I'm canoeing!

54:31.103 --> 54:32.206
[Laughs excitedly]

54:38.724 --> 54:39.803
- [Emon] Ooh.
- [Jamiul] You okay?

54:39.827 --> 54:40.827
[Emon] Yeah. Yeah.

54:40.862 --> 54:42.931
[Jen screams excitedly]

54:42.965 --> 54:45.827
[Rob] Come on,
checkpoint time. Come on.

54:45.862 --> 54:47.586
[Jen] We're going the wrong way.

54:47.620 --> 54:49.068
Do we need to go over there?

54:50.482 --> 54:51.586
[Both] Whoo!

54:51.620 --> 54:53.103
[Laughs]

54:56.000 --> 54:58.137
[Panting]

54:58.172 --> 55:00.793
[Emon] This is awesome,
man. This is sick.

55:04.482 --> 55:05.724
[Jen grunts]

55:06.827 --> 55:08.517
Lovely walk. Lovely.

55:10.034 --> 55:12.355
- [Emon] What the fish?
- [Jamiul] Dude, I'll get a fever, man.

55:12.379 --> 55:13.896
[Jamiul] No!

55:13.931 --> 55:15.689
[Emon] We'll dry
off at checkpoint.

55:15.724 --> 55:17.482
Argh!

55:17.517 --> 55:21.000
Oh, my god, I'm so good at
canoeing. Look how fast we're going.

55:22.172 --> 55:24.241
So, this is the last beach.

55:24.275 --> 55:26.965
- [Emon] This one.
- This is it.

55:28.344 --> 55:29.862
Freaking awesome.

55:30.620 --> 55:31.758
Hola.

55:33.724 --> 55:36.206
- [Sighs] The dreaded book.
- [Exhales] Here we are.

55:38.517 --> 55:39.896
[Jamiul] Sixth checkpoint.

55:41.068 --> 55:43.068
- [Chuckles]
- [Laughs]

55:43.103 --> 55:44.689
[Sighs in relief]

55:44.724 --> 55:46.724
- [Emon] I didn't expect that.
- [Sighs]

55:46.758 --> 55:48.103
Awesome, man.

55:49.793 --> 55:51.241
Oh, my god.

55:51.275 --> 55:53.635
Genuinely I thought we're
third. I did not think we're first.

55:55.758 --> 55:59.586
Okay, I feel like we're going really
deep into the ocean now, Robbie.

55:59.620 --> 56:01.931
[Jamiul] We've had a
crazy experience this leg.

56:01.965 --> 56:03.896
Very fortunate in the
things that we get to do

56:03.931 --> 56:05.689
and the things that
we're experiencing.

56:07.827 --> 56:09.275
[Sighs]

56:09.310 --> 56:12.206
I think we had some... The teams
must have had issues along the way.

56:13.517 --> 56:16.448
It's taking, Lizzie, ages...

56:16.482 --> 56:18.344
[Narrator] Back
on the mainland...

56:18.379 --> 56:19.551
[Lizzie groans]

56:21.689 --> 56:22.862
Si.

56:22.896 --> 56:24.275
Okay.

56:25.793 --> 56:27.724
Has the boat left?

56:27.758 --> 56:29.038
[Man] Yeah, it has already left.

56:29.586 --> 56:31.206
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

56:31.241 --> 56:33.000
Okay, fine. You know,
don't worry about it.

56:33.034 --> 56:35.000
Are you running in the morning?

56:35.034 --> 56:36.310
- Yeah.
- At what time?

56:36.344 --> 56:37.965
- 7:00.
- At 7:00.

56:38.000 --> 56:39.068
[Man] 7:00 A.M., yeah.

56:39.103 --> 56:41.655
- We can't do anything about it.
- [Lizzie] Yeah.

56:41.689 --> 56:43.862
[Dom] I'm just
absolutely gutted that

56:43.896 --> 56:46.000
we've raced so hard this leg

56:46.034 --> 56:48.724
to get this close, right
at the end, we couldn't...

56:48.758 --> 56:51.310
I'm pretty sure the
island was literally there.

56:51.344 --> 56:53.758
And we can't cross. Just gutted.

56:55.586 --> 56:57.689
[Narrator] The siblings
weren't the only ones

56:57.724 --> 57:00.344
unable to reach the
checkpoint tonight.

57:00.379 --> 57:02.379
[Sam] Finally on the
bus to the checkpoint.

57:04.310 --> 57:05.793
[Jen] I broke a nail.

57:05.827 --> 57:07.275
[Rob] Caw-caw, caw-caw.

57:08.172 --> 57:10.689
[Jen and Rob grunting]

57:12.620 --> 57:14.000
[Jen panting]

57:16.482 --> 57:18.896
Look, we're in the
right place. It's here.

57:21.034 --> 57:23.137
- Yay.
- Ahh! Finally.

57:23.172 --> 57:25.310
[Rob] Maintained second place.

57:25.344 --> 57:27.310
Turns out I'm so good canoeing.

57:27.344 --> 57:30.620
Half nine, half ten, half
one, half two, half three.

57:30.655 --> 57:33.965
The gap was one and
half hours, then it was four.

57:34.000 --> 57:36.551
Now it's six. But that's okay.

57:36.586 --> 57:38.034
Still second.

57:38.068 --> 57:40.217
I think we just learning to actually
have a good time, aren't we?

57:40.241 --> 57:43.965
- Yeah, definitely. Yeah.
- We're getting the balance just perfect.

57:44.000 --> 57:46.551
[Emon] It's been quite an
emotional leg for both of us.

57:46.586 --> 57:48.000
The things that we witnessed,

57:48.034 --> 57:51.241
you know, must have been about
eight, nine kids sleeping on the floor.

57:51.275 --> 57:54.241
If you ask me would this race have
changed me, I would have said, "no,"

57:54.275 --> 57:55.838
'cause, you know, I've always
been the kinda guy that...

57:55.862 --> 57:57.758
You know, I run my own business,

57:57.793 --> 57:59.620
I'm doing very
well in my business,

57:59.655 --> 58:02.137
and I've been very strict and...

58:02.172 --> 58:04.034
I guess it just softened
me up a little bit.

58:04.068 --> 58:05.793
This made me
realize, you know what,

58:05.827 --> 58:09.517
it's a big world out there, I'm
just a little dot in the spectrum.

58:12.172 --> 58:13.758
I'm just grateful
for what I got.

58:16.586 --> 58:17.827
Mendoza, here we come.

58:17.862 --> 58:20.724
[Narrator] With just two
legs till the finish line...

58:20.758 --> 58:23.482
- A little push.
- [Narrator] Budgets are at breaking point.

58:23.517 --> 58:27.482
Don't blow away the budget, day one. Keep
making money. Keep watching our budget.

58:27.517 --> 58:29.320
To make it the end, it's
questionable right now.

58:29.344 --> 58:31.724
-[Narrator] And the gloves are off.
-Thank you.

58:34.931 --> 58:36.379
Long day, eh, pal?
